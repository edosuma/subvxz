¶ ¶

01:30.658 --> 01:32.324
Morning, deeks.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.193
What's up, sam?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.195
You spill
your granola?

01:36.197 --> 01:38.564
(chuckles) no, I'm just doing
a little bit of spring cleaning.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.200
Yeah? Kensi know about this?
Deeks: Not exactly,

01:41.202 --> 01:44.203
But we've been so successful
cleaning the house,

01:44.205 --> 01:46.438
I am now moving on
to the office.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.575
So you're trying to fix
your girlfriend?

01:49.577 --> 01:52.211
Ooh, ooh, I wouldn't say that
I'm trying to "fix" anybody.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.445
Ah.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.446
Can't change somebody.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.781
You can only change yourself.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.216
It's all about acceptance, baby.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.717
Yeah, I don't know
if I'm buying that.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.385
What if you have a friend
that becomes addicted to heroin?

02:00.387 --> 02:01.553
Do you just accept that?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.822
No, you love
that person.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.757
You care about 'em,
so you stage an intervention.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.359
Oh, so this is an intervention?

02:07.361 --> 02:10.362
Of sorts. You know, 'cause
she's addicted to the mess.

02:10.364 --> 02:13.665
She's, like, a...
Like, a mess-head.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.201
Are you familiar
with the serenity prayer?

02:16.203 --> 02:17.769
"god, grant me
the serenity

02:17.771 --> 02:20.472
To accept the things
I cannot change."

02:20.474 --> 02:22.307
Amen, brother.
Deeks: Wait for it.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.676
"and the courage to change
the things that I can,

02:24.678 --> 02:26.612
And the wisdom to know
the difference."

02:26.614 --> 02:28.780
Oh, so you're a "wise" guy.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.516
I'm just saying
I know the difference,

02:30.518 --> 02:32.484
And she is gonna love
her desk, trust me.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.187
Speak of the devil.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.656
Uh, deeks, what the hell?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.258
Really?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.325
You talking about,
"what the hell"?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.261
This is your new clean desk.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.263
Look, "action items,"
"to shred," "to scan,"

02:44.265 --> 02:45.330
Your name tags
and pencils,

02:45.332 --> 02:46.865
Your inbox-- we're killing it.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.800
How am I supposed
to find anything now?

02:48.802 --> 02:49.801
What are you talking about?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.170
This is how you find everything.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.337
You know what they say,

02:52.339 --> 02:53.672
That "cleanliness
is next to godliness."

02:53.674 --> 02:56.475
Sometimes cleanliness
is next to impossible.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.543
(vacuum humming)
I tried to warn him.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.710
Mm-hmm.

02:58.712 --> 02:59.711
Can you please stop doing that?

02:59.713 --> 03:01.180
You really don't
need to do that.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.781
(rattling, vacuum stops)

03:02.783 --> 03:04.883
Oh, that's not
a good sound.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.318
I hope you have
a warranty for that.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.954
Oh, no. Oh, no.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.355
What? What?
No, no, no.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.791
Deeks, my dad's
rifle expert badge.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.927
From the
marine corps?
Yes.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.562
Impressive.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.263
I was gonna get it framed.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.265
Why would you leave
something so important

03:20.267 --> 03:21.433
Just loose on your desk?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.368
Why would you mess with my desk?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.271
You might need
a screwdriver, deeks.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.606
Might need
couple's therapy.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.942
Come on, just get
it out, please.

03:30.811 --> 03:31.810
Sam: Ooh.
Wow.

03:31.812 --> 03:32.978
(deeks coughing)

03:32.980 --> 03:36.315
That was a strong
move there, pig-pen.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.449
Deeks:
No.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.484
(coughs)

03:39.486 --> 03:41.486
See?

03:41.488 --> 03:42.988
We're good.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.724
(coughs)

03:45.725 --> 03:48.459
Haven't seen a sandstorm like
that since '09 in fallujah.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.763
It's be a shame if that dust
ruined our new wardrobe.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.299
Sam:
Those are nice suits, hetty.

03:54.301 --> 03:57.469
Uh, going undercover
at a wedding, a funeral?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.339
Uh, for the next 48 hours,
you're being assigned to a pso.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.374
Personal security operation?

04:02.376 --> 04:03.709
Precisely.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.544
Callen: That's not
exactly what we do.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.546
Are you sure that's really
the best use of resources?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.448
Deeks: Yeah, hetty,
I will always love you,

04:09.450 --> 04:11.984
But we are more than bodyguards.

04:11.986 --> 04:14.653
Callen (chuckling):
What about the protective
operations field office?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.988
They can't handle
this one alone.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.924
It's an all-hands-on-deck deal.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.261
The commander of the pacific
command is coming to town.

04:22.263 --> 04:24.696
He has a principal security
advisor at all times.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.465
Why do you need us?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.799
High-level navy officials
are coming

04:27.801 --> 04:30.335
From nine asian allies
to discuss developments

04:30.337 --> 04:31.570
In the south china sea.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.372
The new artificial islands.

04:33.374 --> 04:37.743
Yes. Interested parties
include japan, indonesia,

04:37.745 --> 04:40.479
South korea and, uh, australia.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.681
We'll assist in protecting
the principals.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.583
Better suit up,

04:44.585 --> 04:46.018
Pacom's on the move.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.953
Deeks: Uh, quick question.
Can we get, uh,

04:47.955 --> 04:49.955
Those cuff mikes
they're always talking into?

04:49.957 --> 04:50.956
You know, like...
(imitates static)

04:50.958 --> 04:52.424
Bamboo arriving on andy.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.860
Nighthawk is heading
for the, uh, the buckeye.

04:54.862 --> 04:57.562
Get those things, the...

04:57.564 --> 04:59.431
No? All right.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.467
Mr. Deeks, your desk
is a disaster.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.404
Why don't you take
a lesson from miss blye

05:05.406 --> 05:07.506
And tidy up?

05:07.508 --> 05:09.608
Copy that.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.404
That's a nice tight
group right there.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.472
Thanks.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.709
Try slowing down
your rate of fire.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.410
Get the muzzle back on target.

05:45.412 --> 05:46.712
Thanks for the tip.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.413
Yeah.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.048
So, uh, gates,

05:50.050 --> 05:52.951
Where did you learn to shoot?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.120
Atf.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.057
Hello, henrietta.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.759
Good morning.
Good morning.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.746
Owen.

06:04.747 --> 06:06.964
Is special agent gates
part of the security detail?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.034
I don't believe so.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.436
But he is based
out of singapore.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.372
He is.
And?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.006
And?

06:17.077 --> 06:19.644
Okay, I have a busy day.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.951
Are you all right
with this, owen?

06:25.953 --> 06:28.553
Dealing with
our korean friends?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.022
One thing I've learned,
henrietta,

06:31.024 --> 06:33.625
You leave the past in the past.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.034
Man:<i> I know you've all</i>
<i> trained at fletc,</i>

06:43.036 --> 06:45.036
<i> But it's been a while,</i>
<i> so a couple reminders.</i>

06:45.038 --> 06:47.839
Never carry luggage--
compromises your mission.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.675
Pacom travels with his
principal security advisor,

06:50.677 --> 06:53.545
Who always gets the door
and sits in the rear.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.046
As a chase car,
we are backup in the event

06:55.048 --> 06:57.048
Of mechanical failure or attack.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.150
"attack"?

06:58.152 --> 07:00.185
There's an ambush bag
in the back,

07:00.187 --> 07:01.787
But I've never had the need.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.488
Knock on simulated wood.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.790
You know,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.858
The job is 99% boredom.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.527
Mmm.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.661
But there are ways
to pass the time

07:09.663 --> 07:11.663
When you're standing
watch for hours.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.532
You got any tips?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.667
Personally, I like to count
all the floor tiles.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.637
What do you do when you finish?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.573
Start over again, make sure
I get the same answer twice.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.043
You two have
good bladder control?

07:25.045 --> 07:27.813
I can only speak
for myself, but...

07:27.815 --> 07:29.481
We try to provide a bathroom
break every few hours,

07:29.483 --> 07:31.817
But go easy on the coffee.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.819
Okay.
What about support hose?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.023
What about 'em?

07:38.024 --> 07:39.223
Varicose veins are definitely

07:39.226 --> 07:41.226
An occupational hazard when
you're on your feet all day.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.561
Might want to pick up

07:42.563 --> 07:43.695
Some elastic knee-highs
on your break.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.096
Your calves
will thank you.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.604
Looks like it's showtime.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.840
(engines starting)

07:57.211 --> 07:59.044
Man:
Okay, that was smooth.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.579
Got him in the limo.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.113
First phase
of the mission complete.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.915
I don't know, it was
a little touch-and-go there.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.618
You have to excuse my partner.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.153
I think he knows
I was joking.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.821
We should respect
their work.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.623
Do respect their work.
Try to show it.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.224
I will try.

08:12.226 --> 08:14.059
Okay.
Okay.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.893
How long you two been married?

08:18.499 --> 08:19.965
Deeks:
Sam, callen, you there?

08:19.967 --> 08:20.999
Go ahead, deeks.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.834
(indistinct chanting, shouting)

08:22.836 --> 08:24.870
You got activity
at your destination.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.138
As you can probably hear,
we got a protest rally.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.507
About what?

08:28.509 --> 08:29.975
It's a group
of filipino students

08:29.977 --> 08:32.511
Who don't want the u.S. Military
in their homeland.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.179
They love us
in the philippines.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.715
Yeah, not feeling
a lot of love right now.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.085
You know what, divert to
the side entrance of the hotel.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.953
Copy that.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.724
Man:
<i> Team zulu, be advised,</i>

08:45.726 --> 08:47.792
<i> Using alternative arrival</i>
<i> point b.</i>

08:50.931 --> 08:52.898
Down and to the right.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
(indistinct chanting, shouting)

08:54.902 --> 08:56.868
Someone must have tipped them
off. We'll do a threat scan.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.136
Tighten up.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.673
Come on.

09:01.675 --> 09:02.841
Get back, get back.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.175
Stay back, stay back.

09:04.177 --> 09:05.744
Get back, get back.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.212
Let's get him to the door.
Back up!

09:09.783 --> 09:10.916
Gun!

09:12.853 --> 09:14.185
Kensi: Get down!
Everybody, get down!

09:14.187 --> 09:16.721
Kens, front left.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.159
Clear.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.660
Deeks: Wow, you're pretty
well-dressed for a student.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.245
When I was in college,

09:23.246 --> 09:24.829
I kept busy by playing
beer pong and streaking.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.898
You, my friend,
are missing out.

09:37.311 --> 09:39.311
You've made
a big mistake.

09:39.313 --> 09:41.313
Unless you have
a concealed carry permit,

09:41.315 --> 09:42.847
You've made
a bigger mistake.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.316
Sunglasses.

09:44.318 --> 09:46.151
I was reaching for them
when you tackled me.

09:46.153 --> 09:47.986
What, and your gun
got in the way?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.988
And what is this?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.756
A tracking device.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.725
My name is sung ahn.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.061
South korean national
intelligence service.

09:56.063 --> 09:59.598
My passport and I.D. Are in the
right inner pocket of my jacket.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.134
Just out of curiosity, what
is a south korean agent doing

10:03.136 --> 10:06.071
In an anti-american
filipino protest rally?

10:06.073 --> 10:07.739
I got caught up in the crowd.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.342
I'm doing advance work
for our fleet commander.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.977
Personal security.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.713
I guess we're gonna have
to check that out.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.948
Of course.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.619
So your mr. Ahn
is not a bad guy.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.621
In fact,
he's very much a good guy.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.323
It's true.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.024
He was vetted by the state
department two weeks ago.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.327
He arrived 9:45 p.M. Two nights
ago from seoul, south korea.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.862
Eric:
Seat 40-a.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.030
He prefers window seats.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.298
Although, for dinner,
we're not sure

10:33.300 --> 10:35.166
If he ordered the seared
judong beef rib-eye

10:35.168 --> 10:37.702
Or the stir-fried prawns
with black bean sauce.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.371
What about this daewoo k5?

10:39.373 --> 10:41.940
Nell: Yes, his handgun
was registered in advance,

10:41.942 --> 10:43.642
All the way down
to the serial number

10:43.644 --> 10:46.077
And the 26 rounds of ammunition
he's currently carrying.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.345
Thanks.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.015
All right, mr. Ahn.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.050
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.251
Deeks:
What is this?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.221
Please be careful with that.
Wow.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.722
Is this a video camera?

10:57.724 --> 11:00.325
Huh? That's very 007 of you.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.860
What else you got, huh?

11:01.862 --> 11:03.728
Invisible ink?

11:03.730 --> 11:05.330
Cyanide capsules?

11:05.332 --> 11:06.998
You said you were doing
personal security.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.233
Correct.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.001
For the conference.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.736
Deeks: Well, that's strange.
I don't know any bodyguards

11:11.738 --> 11:14.372
That have, uh, hidden cameras
and gps trackers.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.909
Is there something else
going on?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.313
Just before we left,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.849
We intercepted an encrypted
communication to pyongyang.

11:24.851 --> 11:27.318
Sent from our
fleet commander's office.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.054
Deeks: How do you send
a message to north korea?

11:29.056 --> 11:32.157
There's no cell phone service,
no e-mail, no internet.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.093
It was embedded in a photo
on a social media site.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.162
It said "plan activated."

11:37.164 --> 11:39.164
Someone may have ties
to north korea.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.999
Yeah, a double agent, a mole.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.834
So you think your fleet
commander might be the target?

11:42.836 --> 11:44.335
Anything is possible.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.336
But why do it here?

11:45.338 --> 11:46.371
Why not do it back home?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.173
He's more vulnerable here.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.009
Easier to escape,
cover your tracks.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.445
Perhaps more of a statement
if he's attacked on u.S. Soil.

11:53.447 --> 11:54.879
Okay.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.048
We can provide
additional security.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.850
We would appreciate that.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.452
If you could be more discreet?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.155
Yeah.

12:06.993 --> 12:08.460
Mm-hmm.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.894
All right.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.963
Copy that, kens, we're on it.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.833
The admiral's tucked in.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.468
He took the red-eye
from honolulu;

12:16.470 --> 12:17.836
He wanted to rest.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.337
Sounds pretty good.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.173
Oh, man.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.376
That's a pretty decent mattress.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.212
It's a lot better
than that lousy apartment

12:27.214 --> 12:28.213
I've been staying in.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.981
My back has been
taking a beating.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.082
Why don't you go stay
at the safe house?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.051
Lead them to my family?

12:33.053 --> 12:35.253
Well, you're welcome
to stay with me.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.122
I got a very nice guest futon.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.224
You ever have any guests?

12:40.894 --> 12:43.161
Well, you would be the first
to actually stay on the futon.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.229
Yeah. Why am I not surprised?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.131
Why'd you even buy it?

12:47.501 --> 12:48.767
Okay, okay, okay, g.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.901
All right.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.035
Thank you for the offer.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.203
I'm honored.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.471
Uh-huh.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.839
How's michelle doing?

12:54.841 --> 12:57.242
Well, she's, uh...

12:57.244 --> 12:58.943
Still safe in the safe house

12:58.945 --> 13:00.845
And going a little stir-crazy

13:00.847 --> 13:02.514
Waiting for granger
to give the "all clear."

13:02.516 --> 13:04.349
Yeah, well...

13:04.351 --> 13:07.118
Every house she stays in
is a safe house.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.554
She could kick
just about anybody's ass.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.322
(computer dinging)

13:11.324 --> 13:13.391
Oh, I got hetty coming up.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.828
Mr. Callen, mr. Hanna.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.496
All is well with the admiral?

13:18.498 --> 13:20.031
Couldn't be better.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.466
So kensi and deeks
have made contact

13:21.468 --> 13:24.169
With a south korean
intelligence officer named ahn.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.570
It warms my heart

13:25.572 --> 13:28.239
When my team
plays well with others.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.842
Well, there are concerns
that there's a possible

13:30.844 --> 13:33.178
North korean double agent within
the south korean entourage.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.247
Perhaps they could use
some help, mr. Hanna.

13:36.249 --> 13:40.051
Wouldn't do to have something
untoward happen to him

13:40.053 --> 13:41.219
On our watch.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.188
They're pretty closed
to outsiders.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.290
In the minibar in your room,

13:45.292 --> 13:47.192
Is a water bottle

13:47.194 --> 13:49.994
With a green label on it.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.231
It contains an odorless,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.233
Tasteless syrup of ipecac.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.203
Doesn't that cause
violent vomiting?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.171
Well, for a short period.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.472
But it's harmless.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.274
Hetty, one of us could have
opened that.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.310
But you didn't, did you?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.345
Use it with discretion.

14:07.347 --> 14:11.182
Ipecac in the minibar?

14:11.184 --> 14:14.018
Did you know there was more
to this assignment?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.288
Your team is working
a protective service operation.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.058
Which could also be
an undercover assignment

14:20.060 --> 14:22.460
To smoke out
a north korean mole.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.863
Gentlemen, you are at the hotel

14:24.865 --> 14:26.264
For one reason

14:26.266 --> 14:29.100
And one reason only.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.308
(retching)

14:58.598 --> 15:00.265
(knocking)

15:09.976 --> 15:12.277
Gentlemen.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.246
Special agent sam hanna, ncis.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.382
We don't want you to be late
to your keynote session.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.288
Jong rhee,
head of security.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.273
This is admiral bai.

15:25.274 --> 15:27.257
A pleasure meeting you,
admiral.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.993
One of our agents
has taken ill.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.364
I'd be happy to assist.

15:37.404 --> 15:40.038
We appreciate your kind offer,
agent hanna.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.344
(elevator bell dings)

15:58.491 --> 16:00.425
Lobby's a public place.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.943
Once we get downstairs,

16:01.944 --> 16:03.460
We should convert
to a diamond formation.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.737
Thank you.
We have a protocol.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.006
(elevator bell dings)

16:20.647 --> 16:23.348
I see you've made
some new friends.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.185
Callen (over earwig):
Sam.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.153
Check out mr. Smartphone.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.255
We don't text
while we're on duty.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.457
It decreases
situational awareness.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.259
Guy on your left.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.427
How you doing?

16:36.429 --> 16:37.462
Callen:
No eye contact.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.830
Is that cultural

16:38.831 --> 16:40.197
Or does he have
something to hide?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.741
Callen:
Or...

16:49.742 --> 16:52.076
Does mr. Head of security
want to kill his boss?

17:11.498 --> 17:13.531
Go, sam, go.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.366
There's a new sheriff
in town.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.135
Callen: You better hope
sam keeps you alive.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.587
¶ ¶

17:37.657 --> 17:38.656
Bathroom break.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.058
You come with us.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.376
Copy that.

17:41.377 --> 17:42.693
Sam (over earwig):
Moving to the restroom, g.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.295
I'll stay with the admiral.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.830
Kensi and deeks have your back.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.201
Everything
going well, sir?

17:50.203 --> 17:51.202
Very well.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.271
But I need advice.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
From me?
Yes.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.341
Tonight, we will relax
at a karaoke bar.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.477
You will join us?
Of course.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.546
I want to be sure
we find a good place.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.420
I've got
the commander's assistant,

18:09.422 --> 18:11.189
Captain kang.

18:12.158 --> 18:15.226
I got a wandering security guy.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.331
This guy's definitely on edge.

18:23.837 --> 18:25.436
Kang's using a pay phone.
Deeks: Pay phone?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.271
They still have those?

18:27.273 --> 18:29.674
Eric, I'm gonna need you
to trace the call.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.476
Slice of tiramisu.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.411
Pay phone, east lobby, please.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.479
Nell:
We're on it.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.451
Oh, yikes. False alarm.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.320
He's just buying
anti-diarrhea medicine.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.355
Trying to be discreet.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.756
Okay, I got an angle
to get a read.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.825
Kang is saying,

18:47.827 --> 18:50.261
"I'll meet you there tonight,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.796
The place we talked about."

18:51.798 --> 18:53.698
Nell:
Which now makes him
a person of interest.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.433
Eric:
Sorry, kens.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.335
That call went to a burn phone.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.303
Is he cleared to carry a weapon?

18:59.305 --> 19:01.539
Uh, that's a negative.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.874
Kang is a military attaché,

19:02.876 --> 19:05.209
Assistant
to the fleet commander.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.278
Never travels with a gun.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.320
Kang's with his partner.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.389
He went inside.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.657
Eric:
Whoa, I got something.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.459
Get your butts
to a secure laptop.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.164
All right, eric,
we're good to go.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.400
Okay, so the south korea navy
has their knickers in a twist

19:29.402 --> 19:31.235
'cause a mole
that may be communicating

19:31.237 --> 19:34.805
With north korea
using this social media site.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.607
A picture of a kitten?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.342
That's... That's it?

19:38.344 --> 19:39.710
The web site was created
in south korea,

19:39.712 --> 19:41.829
Accessed in their naval office,

19:41.830 --> 19:43.947
And then read by satellite
phone in pyongyang, north korea.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.417
That's a qr code in the corner.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.953
That's a discreet way to send
a hidden message.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.322
The 2-d barcode translates to...

19:51.324 --> 19:53.424
"plan activated."

19:53.426 --> 19:54.859
Okay.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.427
So what's the plan?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.529
Pick up your dry cleaning,
contribute to the 401k,

19:58.531 --> 20:00.298
Kill the fleet commander?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.300
Yeah, and here's
the interesting thing.

20:02.301 --> 20:04.301
Yesterday,
someone "liked" the photo.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.304
Well, in all fairness,
it is a cute cat.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.805
Nell:
Someone in pasadena,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.774
Who changed the qr code
to "ready"

20:09.776 --> 20:12.577
Using the guest wireless network
at m.D.D.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.612
M.D.D., the defense contractor?

20:14.614 --> 20:16.514
Yeah, they write software
for sanctuary missiles.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.283
Imagine if north korea
got ahold of that.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.452
They could disable the missiles
protecting the naval bases

20:21.454 --> 20:23.287
In south korea, japan,

20:23.289 --> 20:24.855
Philippines, guam...

20:24.857 --> 20:26.924
Okay. So the mole might not even
be here to hurt the commander.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.492
Yeah, he could be working
on something

20:28.494 --> 20:30.361
Bigger than pearl harbor.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.532
¶ ¶

20:36.502 --> 20:38.569
(dance music playing)

20:49.782 --> 20:52.683
Granger (over earwig): Heads up.
Sam and his party have arrived.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.756
Back to the right,
room three.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.458
The ladies are from
the chamber of commerce.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.759
Both have been
background-checked.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.532
Bai:
I love it.

21:08.534 --> 21:09.900
Sam, what song
will you sing?

21:09.902 --> 21:11.769
No, I'm sorry. I'm working, sir.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.704
Do you like
broadway show tunes?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.473
Of course, who doesn't?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.108
Which is your favorite?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.742
Oh, there's so many good ones,
it's hard to choose.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.728
(chuckles)

21:20.729 --> 21:22.712
Yes, tonight,
we will sing them all.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.782
All right.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.386
(dance music playing)

21:32.358 --> 21:34.458
To our american friends.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.559
<i> Gun bae!</i>

21:35.561 --> 21:36.627
All:
<i> Gun bae!</i>

21:36.629 --> 21:38.296
Thank you.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.698
¶ oh, oh, do me, baby ¶

21:46.639 --> 21:48.072
¶ all right,
stop what you're doing ¶

21:48.074 --> 21:49.507
¶ 'cause I'm about
to ruin the image ¶

21:49.509 --> 21:51.442
¶ and the style
that you're used to... ¶

21:51.444 --> 21:53.744
I'm going
to use the rest room.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.413
You're gonna miss the show.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.681
Oh, trust me, there'll be more.

21:56.683 --> 21:57.982
¶ I'm the new fool
in town and my sound's ¶

21:57.984 --> 22:00.351
A lot more.
¶ laid down by the underground ¶

22:00.353 --> 22:02.920
¶ I drink up all the hennessy
you got on your shelf ¶

22:02.922 --> 22:04.989
¶ so just let me
introduce myself ¶

22:04.991 --> 22:07.525
¶ my name is humpty... ¶

22:07.527 --> 22:09.060
Sam (on radio): Deeks, I have
kang heading to the men's room.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.729
Copy that. I'm on it.

22:11.731 --> 22:13.798
(dance music playing)

22:37.357 --> 22:39.457
(whistles)

22:39.459 --> 22:41.525
Kang's a no-show
in the bathroom.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.729
Heading your way.

22:44.731 --> 22:46.497
I'll watch the front door.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.366
Don't let that little umbrella

22:48.368 --> 22:50.368
Block your view.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.837
It's my camouflage.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.012
Uh, that was the ladies' room.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.614
Oh, I, I didn't know.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.683
Sorry.
No problem.

23:08.788 --> 23:10.121
Could've met somebody in there.

23:10.123 --> 23:12.590
Oh, yeah.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.466
Woman:
Yeah?

23:22.467 --> 23:24.467
Hi, uh, I think I forgot
my phone in there.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.904
I don't see it.

23:26.906 --> 23:29.006
Okay, thanks.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.142
(indistinct chatter)

23:31.144 --> 23:32.943
Kang's on the move.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.789
Looks like he's heading outside.

23:51.597 --> 23:55.533
He just collected
a hand gun from the coatroom.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.435
There's a woman in the bathroom.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.669
You take kang.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.738
I'll take her.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.543
(indistinct chatter)

24:13.653 --> 24:15.653
Where'd he go?

24:15.655 --> 24:17.521
Good question.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.035
Anything?

24:31.037 --> 24:32.803
Well, we searched
the entire parking lot.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.905
Yeah, and two blocks
around the bar.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.708
I've got ops
on every security cam in k-town,

24:37.710 --> 24:40.110
And callen covering
the hotel perimeter.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.947
This lady was
in the women's room with kang.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.748
Dawn amaro.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.517
That's dawn amaro, rn.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.085
Pediatric nurse from pasadena.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.587
She volunteers with cast,

24:49.589 --> 24:51.789
The anti-human
trafficking ngo.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.492
She visited south korea
a year ago.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.126
Thank you, guys.
Both: Yeah.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.062
So, what do we think here?

24:58.063 --> 24:59.997
Registered nurse by day
and international spy by night?

24:59.999 --> 25:03.100
Go talk to the lady.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.542
Hi, dawn.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.210
I am kensi blye, ncis.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.846
Marty deeks, lapd.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.982
I'm not sure
what's going on here.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.717
Well, you were
in the ladies' room

25:19.719 --> 25:22.152
With a male suspect
that we're investigating.

25:22.154 --> 25:24.154
Yeah, I heard that part.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.155
Did you find the guy?

25:25.157 --> 25:26.690
Arrest him?

25:26.692 --> 25:28.926
Why were you
at the bar?

25:28.928 --> 25:31.161
I was meeting
some friends from work.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.096
Who else was there
with you?

25:32.098 --> 25:34.265
I was the first to arrive.

25:34.267 --> 25:36.100
Mm, picked a nice place--
know what I mean?

25:36.102 --> 25:38.836
Good, uh, south korean vibe.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.005
I wouldn't know.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.139
Dawn, you were
in seoul last year.

25:42.141 --> 25:45.042
Not for karaoke bars.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.810
I was working in towns
where girls get recruited

25:46.812 --> 25:48.712
By trafficking brokers.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.017
How do you know james kang?

25:55.288 --> 25:58.155
(sighs) from my time in korea.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.724
Okay.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.726
So, you've worked
with the navy?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.194
No.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.063
His niece was about
to come to america

26:06.065 --> 26:07.932
As a massage therapist.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.568
They promised her money,
the good life.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.702
She would've
been enslaved

26:11.704 --> 26:13.804
As a sex worker
had we not intervened.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.205
He was grateful.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.941
So, you guys have
kept in contact then?

26:16.943 --> 26:18.576
Yeah.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.244
And how did you know
where to meet kang?

26:20.246 --> 26:22.112
He gave me a cell phone.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.347
May I?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.685
James said it had to be

26:27.686 --> 26:29.119
Untraceable phone
because he does classified work

26:29.121 --> 26:30.287
For the military.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.656
And what else did james say?

26:32.658 --> 26:35.359
That I could be in danger.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.127
And he wouldn't say why.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.263
But here's
where it gets weird, okay?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.765
He says he's gonna leave me
a gun under a bus stop bench.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.068
But it's crazy--
why do I need a gun?

26:44.070 --> 26:46.303
When you met him
in the bathroom,

26:46.305 --> 26:48.272
Was there any physical contact?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.208
A quick hug?

26:55.681 --> 26:58.182
Am I, am I really in danger?

26:58.184 --> 27:00.117
(sighs)

27:00.118 --> 27:02.051
We don't think kang
is who he says he is.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.222
What's that supposed to mean?

27:05.224 --> 27:08.225
We think he may be using you
to pass along information

27:08.227 --> 27:10.327
To a foreign agency.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.296
No.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.865
No, he's a really sweet guy.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.934
That's his craft.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.669
In fact, he may have
planted something

27:18.671 --> 27:19.870
On you already.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.238
You shouldn't go home tonight.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.906
(sighs)

27:22.908 --> 27:25.309
And where am I supposed to go?

27:30.650 --> 27:31.815
<i> (knocking)</i>

27:31.817 --> 27:33.250
Deeks:
<i> Room service.</i>

27:35.121 --> 27:36.720
Nurse is safe and sound?

27:36.722 --> 27:38.322
Yeah, two doors down
with security.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.257
Nice.
Any eyes on kang?

27:40.259 --> 27:43.260
Uh, he's still mia.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.262
But agent ahn is fully recovered
from the ipecac.

27:45.264 --> 27:46.697
Kensi:
Oh.

27:46.698 --> 27:48.131
Well, found the
Saturday night special

27:48.134 --> 27:50.134
Exactly where kang
told her it would be.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.802
Man of his word.

27:51.804 --> 27:54.905
You boys, uh, both manage
to get some sleep?

27:54.907 --> 27:56.840
Yeah, I feel good.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.442
Yeah.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.712
Well, that's interesting, 'cause
then it looks like you guys

28:01.714 --> 28:04.982
Cuddled together all night.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.350
Just one bed.

28:06.352 --> 28:07.851
All messed up.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.319
Ow.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.189
Deeks, I made my bed,
just like I do every day.

28:12.191 --> 28:13.757
Okay?
Oh, well, that's interesting.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.025
You hear that, kens?

28:15.027 --> 28:18.362
Our friend sam makes his bed
every single morning.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.830
Hmm.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.999
Have you learned
nothing, deeks?

28:22.001 --> 28:23.067
(clears throat)
evidently not.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.334
Mm-hmm.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.136
Eric:
Good morning, campers.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.438
Morning.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.039
We need some good news.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.340
Nell:
Not much in that department.

28:30.342 --> 28:32.109
Dawn amaro's
electronic footprint

28:32.111 --> 28:34.211
Is perfectly pristine.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.146
No suspect e-mails,
web sites or bank accounts.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.315
And she has
a hobby writing poetry.

28:38.317 --> 28:40.084
Any word from m.D.D.?

28:40.086 --> 28:41.885
Their system is ironclad.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.420
Firewall, air-gap, encryption.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.723
They log every keystroke.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.858
There's nothing
copied or transferred.

28:47.860 --> 28:48.892
No breaches.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.327
Eric:
And it's impossible

28:50.329 --> 28:51.895
For the guest network
to access their servers.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.031
So, maybe kang didn't
steal military secrets.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.999
Yeah, but then why
is he on the run?

28:56.001 --> 28:57.301
(beeping)
oh.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.169
Well, you can
ask him yourself.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.904
He just boarded
a metro bus in downtown l.A.

29:00.906 --> 29:02.106
Three minutes ago.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.273
Nell:
Granger's closest.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.475
I'll let him know.

29:04.477 --> 29:05.843
He's gonna need backup.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.745
Have fun
counting the tiles.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.122
Heading south
on spring street.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.833
It's possible
I've been made, sam.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.769
Let's move in.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.849
Federal building.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.089
Federal agents!

29:52.091 --> 29:54.158
Ncis!
Hands on your head, kang!

29:54.160 --> 29:55.392
This man may be armed.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.294
Not according
to my metal detector.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.496
We're taking him
into custody.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.032
Hey, I'm afraid
you can't do that.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.467
Tell them.

30:03.469 --> 30:06.003
I'm seeking asylum
in the united states.

30:06.005 --> 30:07.538
If I return
to my country,

30:07.540 --> 30:08.572
They will kill me.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.307
I wish to defect.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.343
Nice try, kang.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.378
He's a suspect wanted
for an ongoing investigation.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.014
Sorry, federal agents or not,

30:17.016 --> 30:18.515
I can't release him
without the approval

30:18.517 --> 30:20.384
From the state department.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.219
This gentleman's
not leaving the building.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.890
Hetty:
<i> Well...</i>

30:26.892 --> 30:29.526
This is a rather
surprising development.

30:29.528 --> 30:31.528
Well, it's also
a rather convenient one.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.896
If this is
a fake defection,

30:32.898 --> 30:35.899
It gives him time
to complete his mission.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.902
And if it's a real defection,
the clock is still ticking.

30:38.904 --> 30:41.338
Yeah, because the cia,
fbi and south korean navy

30:41.340 --> 30:45.209
Will all demand
immediate access to him.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.211
Have a run at it, gentlemen.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.213
Quickly.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.050
I was smuggled into south korea

30:53.052 --> 30:55.485
At age 17 with forged papers.

30:55.487 --> 30:58.255
During my entire career
in the navy,

30:58.257 --> 31:00.958
I was an agent for north korea.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.460
Why do you want to defect?

31:03.462 --> 31:06.196
My life's work

31:06.198 --> 31:08.198
Has been about
giving an advantage

31:08.200 --> 31:11.068
To those who care more
about weapons and warfare

31:11.070 --> 31:13.470
While ignoring the needs
of their own people.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.173
I don't want my legacy

31:16.175 --> 31:19.543
To be about death
and destruction.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.613
Well, that's all very noble,
but we need proof.

31:22.615 --> 31:25.015
Was there a plan

31:25.017 --> 31:26.984
To steal defense secrets
from m.D.D.?

31:26.986 --> 31:30.320
Everything you want...
Is right here.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.089
On a nickel?

31:32.091 --> 31:35.092
Kang: 500 screenshots
of sanctuary missile code

31:35.094 --> 31:37.160
That pyongyang is waiting
to receive from me.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.364
Who gave you that?

31:40.366 --> 31:42.366
It was left for me.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.600
At a pay phone.

31:45.304 --> 31:48.171
There's one thing
I don't get.

31:48.173 --> 31:51.275
After all these years
of allegiance to north korea,

31:51.277 --> 31:53.911
Why now?

31:55.014 --> 31:56.647
(sighs)

31:56.649 --> 31:58.382
I met a woman.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.951
An american woman.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.555
Her name?

32:07.359 --> 32:09.359
Dawn.

32:09.361 --> 32:10.661
Dawn amaro.

32:10.663 --> 32:13.530
The nurse from the karaoke bar?

32:13.532 --> 32:16.566
You haven't seen her for a year.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.603
We sent coded messages
through a poetry web site.

32:20.706 --> 32:24.408
Well, let's hope
she backs up your story.

32:28.314 --> 32:30.981
Okay, so the sd card
is password protected.

32:30.983 --> 32:32.649
Uh, not anymore.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.518
Ooh, needs two-factor
identification.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.953
And... Got it.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.588
Yikes, fully encrypted.
Oh, please.

32:38.590 --> 32:39.690
When's that ever been a problem?

32:39.692 --> 32:41.458
(scoffs)

32:41.460 --> 32:42.492
Nice.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.494
Just what kang
said it was.

32:44.496 --> 32:47.965
Hundreds of screenshots of code
of the sanctuary missile system.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.033
Let's see what
else is on here.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.571
Sam: Any idea
who took the photos?

32:54.573 --> 32:55.989
Eric:
Uh, someone who didn't know

32:55.990 --> 32:57.406
That m.D.D. Recently
updated their screens

32:57.409 --> 32:58.608
With invisible watermarks.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.544
So with a little processing,

33:00.546 --> 33:03.513
We got a username,
I.D. And time stamp.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.717
Uh, "david murray,
system administrator."

33:06.719 --> 33:09.186
Who thought he won the lottery
with an offshore account.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.588
Nell: We contacted
the u.S. Marshall service.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.723
They're on their way
to arrest him.

33:12.725 --> 33:14.391
What about
this poetry web site?

33:14.393 --> 33:15.993
Uh, kang and dawn amaro

33:15.995 --> 33:19.529
Contributed poems and comments
every single day.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.531
You don't expect us to read
all this, do you, eric?

33:21.533 --> 33:22.532
Nell:
No.

33:22.534 --> 33:23.467
Just every fourth word.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.542
Granger: "the beauty of your
spirit overwhelms my being

33:32.544 --> 33:35.345
With every breath I take."

33:35.347 --> 33:36.713
Kang,

33:36.715 --> 33:39.016
Fell pretty hard there, bro.

33:39.018 --> 33:42.753
You kept this up
in secret code every day?

33:42.755 --> 33:44.755
Yes.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.189
(door opens)

33:46.191 --> 33:47.190
(deeks clears throat)

33:47.192 --> 33:49.259
James.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.660
Dawn.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.631
(door closes)

33:54.633 --> 33:57.100
Are we buying their story?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.303
Warming up to it.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.541
Dawn, why didn't
you just tell us?

34:06.712 --> 34:09.379
James said it had to be a secret
until he resigned from the navy.

34:09.381 --> 34:14.351
Wow, you wrote some pretty,
uh, pretty crazy poems there.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.352
(chuckles)

34:15.354 --> 34:16.820
Her life's work
is about humanity,

34:16.822 --> 34:19.689
About lifting people up.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.491
I never knew
those feelings before.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.129
Dawn: James has devoted himself
to making a difference.

34:26.131 --> 34:27.798
He's liberated hundreds of girls
from a life of slavery.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.666
He's not who you think he is.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.102
Okay,
sam and I will take him

34:32.104 --> 34:33.904
Back to the boatshed.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.705
Kensi and deeks, get back
to the hotel with callen.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.641
On it.

34:37.643 --> 34:38.775
Good luck, you two.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.610
Both:
Thank you.

34:42.548 --> 34:44.681
Prieto dropped me off.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.550
He's five minutes away.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.418
Well, tell him
to come pick us up.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.554
(line ringing)

34:50.556 --> 34:52.556
So, what do we do now?

34:52.558 --> 34:56.126
We are gonna take you
someplace safe.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.297
A lot of people want
to talk to you.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.236
(line ringing)

35:06.238 --> 35:07.504
Eric:
Director.

35:07.506 --> 35:08.738
Hey, eric, tell callen

35:08.740 --> 35:11.174
That there's no threat
to commander bai.

35:21.386 --> 35:22.586
Gun!

35:22.588 --> 35:23.753
Everybody, down!

35:27.259 --> 35:29.459
You okay?

35:29.461 --> 35:30.861
Yeah.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.367
Where'd you get
the zip gun?

35:37.369 --> 35:39.369
I printed it at home.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.138
Your mother must be so proud.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.140
Who the hell
is that guy?

35:43.142 --> 35:44.474
North korean agent.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.476
I didn't deliver the coin.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.711
I told you,

35:47.713 --> 35:48.845
If you fail your mission,

35:48.847 --> 35:50.347
They kill you
and your loved ones.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.316
Call the paramedics and lapd.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.218
Let's go. Move! Let's roll!

35:55.220 --> 35:56.486
Stay close.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.626
Agent prieto's
a block away.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.361
(tires screeching)

36:04.363 --> 36:05.729
Down! Down! Down!

36:11.637 --> 36:13.603
Granger?
Fine.

36:13.605 --> 36:14.938
We're okay.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.306
Are we?

36:16.308 --> 36:18.475
Yeah, we're all good.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.353
¶ ¶

36:31.290 --> 36:32.689
Sam:
Move, move! Move!

36:36.228 --> 36:38.328
Go, go, go, go!

36:38.330 --> 36:39.362
Go, go, go!

36:48.273 --> 36:50.207
Take this next right.
Okay.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.281
Threat, left side!

37:00.719 --> 37:01.585
Floor it!

37:04.990 --> 37:06.990
Deeks, we need backup.
We're under attack.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.225
We're approaching

37:08.227 --> 37:09.726
Crenshaw and washington.

37:09.728 --> 37:10.660
We're on our way.

37:10.662 --> 37:13.263
(tires screeching)

37:17.970 --> 37:19.970
Why you slowing down? Prieto?

37:19.972 --> 37:22.272
What are you doing?

37:22.274 --> 37:23.540
Prieto?

37:25.310 --> 37:27.644
Prieto?

37:27.646 --> 37:29.379
Oh, he's hit.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.248
He's been hit.

37:31.250 --> 37:32.682
Granger: All right,
there's cover up ahead.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.950
We're gonna ditch the car.

37:33.952 --> 37:35.852
It's better if we keep moving.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.320
Kang:
They're coming back!

37:42.861 --> 37:44.177
Hold on.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.494
How long
since you trained at glynco?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.930
It's called muscle memory.

37:46.932 --> 37:50.800
(tires screeching)

37:54.273 --> 37:56.273
That's not bad, hanna,

37:56.275 --> 37:59.042
Considering
you're in a passenger seat.

38:06.351 --> 38:07.317
If we don't lose them,

38:07.319 --> 38:08.551
We're gonna lose him.

38:10.689 --> 38:12.022
I'm going for it.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.523
(honking)

38:19.331 --> 38:21.731
Keep pressure
on his neck wound!

38:25.304 --> 38:26.803
(engine revving)

38:28.440 --> 38:30.473
You got to be kidding me!

38:30.475 --> 38:31.941
Down!

38:41.320 --> 38:42.452
(gun clicks)

38:42.454 --> 38:43.887
I'm out!

38:43.889 --> 38:45.422
My last mag.

38:45.424 --> 38:47.624
We may have to fall back
to the car.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.761
¶ ¶

39:03.975 --> 39:05.475
Deeks:
Clear!

39:05.477 --> 39:06.509
Clear!

39:06.511 --> 39:08.411
Sam: Clear!
Granger: Clear!

39:10.749 --> 39:12.382
Wow.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.483
That went bad fast.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.352
Call paramedics.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.786
We got a federal agent down.

39:24.429 --> 39:27.764
Thank you. Thank you.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.433
(sighs) agent prieto
is out of surgery.

39:30.435 --> 39:31.768
He's gonna make it.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.603
That's wonderful news.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.373
And these two
are finally together.

39:36.375 --> 39:39.476
I think they deserve
a little, uh, privacy.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.010
(door closes)

39:41.012 --> 39:42.779
(chuckles)

39:42.781 --> 39:44.547
Ah, where's the suit, g?

39:44.549 --> 39:46.383
I was relieved by backup agents
who flew in from dc.

39:46.385 --> 39:48.418
Hetty, let me
ask you something.

39:48.420 --> 39:49.936
When you sent us out,

39:49.937 --> 39:51.453
Were you aware of the threat
from north korea?

39:51.456 --> 39:54.124
Sometimes I just think

39:54.126 --> 39:57.093
It's being in the right place
at the right time.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.430
Granger:
Here's lunch.

40:00.432 --> 40:02.098
Korean takeout.
(laughs)

40:02.100 --> 40:03.433
Ah.

40:03.435 --> 40:04.134
Ooh.

40:04.136 --> 40:05.502
Ah-ha.

40:07.139 --> 40:10.473
And by the way, those five north
korean agents we took down,

40:10.475 --> 40:11.975
They were on the dog's chip.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.576
"dog's chip"?

40:13.578 --> 40:15.578
Hobbs's list
from the animal shelter.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.480
It was ten names
of north korean sleeper agents.

40:17.482 --> 40:18.481
Kensi: Gotcha.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.650
Three at christmas, five today.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.119
Only two agents remain at large.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.589
Ooh, I smell<i> sundubu.</i>

40:26.591 --> 40:28.858
<i> Insamcha</i> and<i> gimbap,</i>
your favorite.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.126
Yeah, no,

40:30.128 --> 40:31.728
I don't think
I'm gonna have any.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.563
My stomach actually is
a little bit off.

40:34.566 --> 40:35.832
Sam:
You didn't drink the, uh,

40:35.834 --> 40:36.900
Water in the minibar

40:36.902 --> 40:38.535
With the green label, did you?

40:38.537 --> 40:39.636
(groans)

40:39.638 --> 40:41.671
No. No. But...

40:41.673 --> 40:42.972
Aw. Are you okay?

40:42.974 --> 40:44.607
(groans)
what's going on there?

40:44.609 --> 40:46.976
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

40:46.978 --> 40:49.179
I just think that
maybe too much korean
it's your belly?

40:49.181 --> 40:50.747
Karaoke and...

40:50.749 --> 40:52.615
Oh.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.883
And what do I have here?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.487
Aw...

40:57.489 --> 40:59.823
(clears throat)

40:59.825 --> 41:02.492
"roses are red,
violets are blue,

41:02.494 --> 41:04.494
"your desk is a mess...
"but."

41:04.496 --> 41:07.864
"but I don't care
because you're worth it

41:07.866 --> 41:09.532
"and I'll try not to make fun
of it ever again

41:09.534 --> 41:11.201
Because I love you."

41:11.203 --> 41:13.203
It's, uh, inspired by kang.

41:13.205 --> 41:15.772
It's about, uh, acceptance.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.207
I don't know
if I can accept this.

41:17.209 --> 41:18.608
I think we need to work
on your poetry.

41:18.610 --> 41:21.044
It's better if you read
every fourth word.

41:21.046 --> 41:23.813
Then it becomes like keats.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.882
Oh, deeks.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.090
This way
it doesn't get sucked up

41:34.092 --> 41:36.626
In the dustbuster
by your idiot boyfriend.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.663
I've been wanting to do this
for a very long time.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.567
Thank you so much.

41:44.569 --> 41:46.603
Kensi, food's going fast.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.071
Okay.
(clears throat)

41:48.073 --> 41:49.606
Some kimchi left?

41:49.608 --> 41:51.107
'cause I do love
myself some kimchi.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.710
I hear it has
medicinal qualities.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.211
Well, you got to leave
some for dawn and kang.

41:55.213 --> 41:57.046
How are we taking care of them?

41:57.048 --> 41:58.581
Safe house.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.016
Then new identities.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.118
Granger: Wait, I know
a safe house we can use.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.687
Hanna's family is coming
out of protective custody.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.990
Seriously?

42:06.992 --> 42:09.626
Intel tells us
the threat's diminished.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.561
You sure?

42:11.563 --> 42:12.729
As sure as we can be.

42:12.731 --> 42:13.763
Anyway,

42:13.765 --> 42:15.131
Getting your family back.

42:17.536 --> 42:19.836
Well, I thank you.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.704
And my back thanks you.

42:21.706 --> 42:23.172
That calls for a toast.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.542
In korean.
Uh, well...

42:27.078 --> 42:28.611
(sighs)

42:28.613 --> 42:31.748
(speaks korean)

42:31.750 --> 42:33.182
Translation, please?

42:33.184 --> 42:36.219
"after hardship...

42:36.221 --> 42:39.122
<i> Comes happiness." </i>
deeks:<i> Cheers to that.</i>

42:39.124 --> 42:40.123
Kensi:<i> Hear, hear. </i>
Callen:<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
