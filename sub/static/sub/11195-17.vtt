00:08.132 --> 00:12.846
(O'Neill) Yeah. Kasuf,
about this voice that spoke to you...

00:12.971 --> 00:17.518
Yes. It spoke the name of my daughter,
may she rest in peace.

00:17.601 --> 00:22.814
I'm not the only one who heard it. Many
fear it means that the gods are returning.

00:22.898 --> 00:27.194
I thought we'd convinced you and your
people that the Goa'ulds were not gods.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.655
I said "many". Not "I".

00:29.738 --> 00:35.077
But it is easy to understand. In the days
of Ra, when he returned from a journey,...

00:35.160 --> 00:39.540
- ..a storm would blow through the desert.
- It's just wind. Wind happens.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.585
- The wind blew out of an active Stargate.
- And formed a sandstorm.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.838
Don't forget it said the name "Sha're".

00:45.963 --> 00:49.216
It's not like it's
a burning bush or anything.

00:49.341 --> 00:53.887
- I've seen many bushes burn.
- I suppose you have.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.014
It's not far now.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.730
Here.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.779
- There's nothing here.
- Nice... Iight breeze.

01:14.533 --> 01:17.077
(Kasuf) This is where I heard the voice.

01:18.370 --> 01:21.707
I'm getting a build-up
of static electricity, sir.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.254
(disembodied voice) Daniel. Daniel.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.133
- Anybody else just hear that?
- I think so.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.344
Look!

01:39.474 --> 01:41.602
Now that's impressive!

01:44.188 --> 01:46.231
Daniel.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.655
Daniel!

01:53.947 --> 01:57.451
- Try to keep it in Kansas, huh?
- I was just, uh...

02:01.788 --> 02:05.459
I'm Daniel! Who's calling?

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:37.074 --> 02:40.827
I am Shifu. I am Harsesis.

03:58.906 --> 04:03.368
- Well, I think that he is the Harsesis.
- How is that possible?

04:03.452 --> 04:05.996
I'm not sure.
He says he grew like the weeds.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.124
Apophis sired the child
to be his next host.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.712
It is possible he used Goa'uld technology
to make the boy's body mature quickly.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.339
We know that's possible.

04:16.464 --> 04:19.801
What of the knowledge passed on
to him by Amaunet and Apophis?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.763
He says Oma taught him to forget.

04:22.846 --> 04:23.931
Oma?

04:24.014 --> 04:27.768
The alien we encountered on Kheb.
Mother Nature.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.103
Guess that explains the tornado.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.190
Shifu says he came here
to learn more about his mother.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.360
- Shifu?
- His name. It means "Light".

04:36.818 --> 04:39.363
We should have Dr Fraiser
take a look at him.

04:39.488 --> 04:42.366
If he was altered,
he could still be growing quickly.

04:42.449 --> 04:46.036
- Is it wise to bring him back?
- I don't think he's a danger.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.789
What about his stepmom?
She comin' along?

04:49.248 --> 04:53.502
He says that ultimately
a man travels his chosen path alone.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.629
Smart kid.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.801
Get a message to Hammond.
Let him know who we're bringin'.

05:19.695 --> 05:23.949
Shifu, this is General Hammond.
He's the leader of this facility.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.703
- Welcome to Earth.
- A spark lights a flame,...

05:27.786 --> 05:31.290
..but the candle will only
burn as long as the wick.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.840
If I may, sir. I think what he means is...

05:39.965 --> 05:43.385
..the wick is the centre of the candle,...

05:43.468 --> 05:46.722
..and ostensibly a great leader,
like yourself,...

05:46.805 --> 05:50.642
..is essential to the... whole ball of wax.

05:52.352 --> 05:58.859
Basically, what it means is that it's always
better to have a big, long wick. Right?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.821
Don't look at me.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.741
This way.

06:06.742 --> 06:08.785
It's right, though? Right?

06:18.003 --> 06:20.047
OK.

06:20.464 --> 06:24.843
Now, I'm going to take a little bit
of your blood with that needle.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.930
Will you return it to me
when you are done?

06:29.765 --> 06:31.975
I'm afraid I can't.

06:32.059 --> 06:36.688
I have to do some tests on it, and then
it just won't be very good after that.

06:37.397 --> 06:43.237
Leaves fall from the tree once a year.
The tree still grows strong and proud.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.408
Go ahead.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.495
OK.

06:57.543 --> 07:01.213
- Doctor?
- I found traces of the nanite technology...

07:01.338 --> 07:03.882
..that once prematurely aged
Colonel O'Neill.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.886
I've had them analysed by some of
the foremost experts in the field,...

07:08.011 --> 07:11.014
..and they say that
they appear to be inactive.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.267
So they shut themselves off already?

07:13.392 --> 07:16.353
It's possible he's reached
the pre-programmed age.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.564
Or Oma figured out a way to stop it.

07:18.647 --> 07:22.568
Either way we can assume he's in
no immediate physical danger.

07:22.693 --> 07:26.446
What about the information this boy
apparently knows? What can he tell us?

07:26.530 --> 07:29.449
He is born with the genetic memory
of all the Goa'uld.

07:29.533 --> 07:33.453
So the kid should know everything
Apophis knew when he...

07:35.664 --> 07:38.208
Fathered the boy.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.585
That.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.130
That must be an awfully big burden
for a young child to carry.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.799
That is why all Goa'uld are born evil.

07:46.091 --> 07:50.554
And why a benevolent being like Oma
would help him bury those memories,...

07:50.637 --> 07:52.931
..so he could lead a normal life.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.810
Sir, we've received word from the Tok'ra.

07:56.894 --> 08:00.731
- Did we really have to call them?
- (Hammond) We have a treaty with them.

08:00.814 --> 08:05.444
Specifically mentioned is the exchange
of all potential sources of information...

08:05.569 --> 08:08.488
..pertaining to the Goa'uld.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.409
They can use the memory-recall device
to extract information from Shifu...

08:12.492 --> 08:15.996
- ..without harming him physically.
- But what about mentally?

08:16.121 --> 08:21.460
What about emotionally? I mean, think
about what we'd be exposing him to.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.297
We'd be flooding his mind with
the thoughts of a thousand Hitlers.

08:25.380 --> 08:30.177
One of whom happened to put a...
snake in the head of his mother.

08:31.595 --> 08:35.515
I know this is about protecting Earth
and eliminating the Goa'uld, but...

08:35.640 --> 08:39.852
It seems to me the boy is fairly wise.
Well beyond his years, in fact.

08:39.937 --> 08:44.232
Isn't it possible he might comprehend
the situation if you explained it to him?

08:44.358 --> 08:48.195
Well, I guess so,
but I doubt he'd be willing to remember.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.615
And even if he is, how can we ask him to?

08:52.533 --> 08:56.203
Well, if he forgot once,
maybe he could forget again.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.384
She spoke to you through
the Goa'uld hand device?

09:11.301 --> 09:13.345
Yes.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.765
She was strong.

09:18.058 --> 09:23.105
In those moments, as Amaunet tried
to kill me, it felt like I lived a lifetime.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.317
- Like a dream.
- Yes.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.655
- Dreams teach.
- Sometimes.

09:31.738 --> 09:37.494
In this one I got to say goodbye, and your
mother told me how important you were.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.039
Oma teaches: the true nature of a man...

09:41.123 --> 09:44.293
..is decided in the battle
between his conscious mind...

09:44.376 --> 09:47.004
..and the desires of his subconscious.

09:48.338 --> 09:53.385
Oma teaches: the evil in my
subconscious is too strong to resist.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.555
The only way to win is to deny it battle.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.435
Yeah...

10:01.518 --> 10:07.274
You see, the thing is... we can't deny
the battle against the Goa'uld for ever.

10:08.025 --> 10:12.738
The information contained within your
buried memories could really help us.

10:12.863 --> 10:16.116
You have chosen a path that leads to me
because of this.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.702
Yes.

10:20.078 --> 10:25.042
You must release your burden before
you will find your own way again.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.003
Yeah. Someone else once said that to me.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.465
Thing is... this is my way.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.512
I chose this path
to honour Sha're's strength.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.265
And ultimately it isn't just about me...

10:41.058 --> 10:43.352
..or you, for that matter.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.522
I understand.

10:47.564 --> 10:51.610
The, uh... Tok'ra have a way to help you
remember only certain things.

10:51.693 --> 10:55.030
How Goa'uld technology works,
their weaknesses.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.952
And then afterwards maybe
Oma can help you forget again.

11:00.869 --> 11:04.623
If the instrument is broken,
the music will be sour.

11:06.959 --> 11:10.128
The music does not play the musician.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.675
- Normally there is truth in that.
- Really?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.179
Good.

11:19.263 --> 11:23.642
Because I really didn't have any idea
what I was talking about there.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.943
All I know is this is very important,
or I wouldn't ask.

12:13.025 --> 12:15.319
Colonel? He's awake.

12:20.908 --> 12:24.828
- What happened?
- I was going to ask you the same thing.

12:24.912 --> 12:28.749
You were talking to the boy,
then you suddenly collapsed.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.223
Hey! How you feelin'?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.894
Fine. I'm, uh...

12:49.978 --> 12:51.438
I'm fine.

12:51.522 --> 12:56.151
Uh... Listen.
What happened with the kid in there?

12:56.985 --> 12:59.279
I asked him for something.

13:01.156 --> 13:04.326
Anything that could help us
fight the Goa'uld.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.579
- Yeah?
- And I think he gave it to me.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.630
These are the long-range sensors.

13:17.840 --> 13:21.343
- I don't know what to ask first.
- The translation may be a little off.

13:21.426 --> 13:24.763
Everything in my head
is actually in Goa'uld.

13:26.598 --> 13:31.478
- Where does it get its power from?
- Liquid naqahdah fuel cell, here.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.731
- Liquid naqahdah?
- Actually it's heavy liquid naqahdah,...

13:34.857 --> 13:39.152
..but don't ask me what makes it heavy.
At least not yet.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.280
Daniel, this...

13:42.447 --> 13:43.282
You OK?

13:43.365 --> 13:48.162
Yeah. It's just that, um... strange things
just keep flying into my mind.

13:48.245 --> 13:53.292
- I'm sorry. What were you saying?
- Just that this is unbelievable.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.711
I know.

14:02.176 --> 14:06.388
- What is it?
- I guess you could call it a satellite, sir.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.851
According to Daniel, it would be capable
of detecting approaching Goa'uld ships...

14:10.976 --> 14:13.103
..thousands of light years away.

14:13.187 --> 14:16.523
Its weapons could penetrate
Goa'uld shield technology...

14:16.648 --> 14:19.193
..and destroy mother ships.

14:19.276 --> 14:23.405
Basically, sir, it's the basis of
the perfect anti-Goa'uld defence system.

14:23.488 --> 14:27.242
Of course, we'd need to build a network
of them and launch them into orbit.

14:27.326 --> 14:31.246
- Can we do that?
- Well, this is an entirely new technology.

14:31.371 --> 14:35.626
We'd need to bring in outside help.
A lot of it. Engineers, physicists...

14:35.709 --> 14:39.546
But ultimately it means
we don't have to involve the Tok'ra.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.425
- Why not?
- Now the Goa'uld think we're no threat.

14:43.509 --> 14:46.470
If it gets out that we're
at this level of technology,...

14:46.553 --> 14:49.014
..we couldn't build
this system fast enough.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.391
You think the Tok'ra would betray us?

14:51.475 --> 14:57.314
Maybe not intentionally, but they've
had problems with Goa'uld spies before.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.235
I don't think it's worth the risk.
Not when we can do this without them.

15:01.318 --> 15:04.738
I'll take that into consideration.
What about the boy?

15:04.863 --> 15:08.033
He doesn't have to remember now.
He's given me the knowledge.

15:08.492 --> 15:12.955
- How he did that is what concerns me.
- He's no danger, sir.

15:13.038 --> 15:16.375
Still, as long as he's here,
he should be kept under close guard.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.546
I'll talk to the Pentagon about bringing in
more personnel to help you out.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.605
- Daniel Jackson.
- Teal'c.

15:38.689 --> 15:41.692
I was unable to complete my kelno'reem.

15:41.775 --> 15:46.321
What is of such importance that I should
be summoned here immediately?

15:54.371 --> 15:56.582
Um...

15:56.665 --> 15:59.042
What does this mean?

16:01.962 --> 16:06.008
I believe the closest translation
would be subatomic energy particles.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.635
That's what I thought. Thank you.

16:14.850 --> 16:18.687
That's it. You can go back
to whatever you were doing.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.287
It'll require the resources
of the entire SGC...

16:35.370 --> 16:37.915
..to focus on the retrieval
of raw naqahdah.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.627
- If we ask the Tok'ra...
- Major Davis, you've prepared a budget?

16:41.752 --> 16:46.548
The Pentagon has budgeted
the satellite network at $80 billion.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.301
Estimated time of completion: two years.

16:49.384 --> 16:52.971
- That's unacceptable.
- Well, if we involve the Russians...

16:53.096 --> 16:55.140
No.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.893
- I'm sorry?
- I said no.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.438
The Russian government has agreed
to stop using their Stargate...

17:01.563 --> 17:04.233
..if we share all information
gathered by the SGC.

17:04.316 --> 17:07.402
- We have to tell them...
- No, we don't.

17:07.528 --> 17:10.405
- But...
- It's OK. I can render their gate inactive.

17:10.489 --> 17:12.449
- You can?
- That's not the point.

17:12.574 --> 17:16.494
The point is we don't know if
the Russians are trading those secrets.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.373
This mustn't get screwed up
by petty Earth politics.

17:19.455 --> 17:22.876
We're protecting this entire planet
from Goa'uld occupation.

17:23.001 --> 17:27.047
I imagine that several of the so-called
petty nations of this planet...

17:27.130 --> 17:31.218
..will be very curious when we launch
satellite weapons two years from now.

17:31.301 --> 17:35.222
- One year from now.
- Impossible. It would double the cost.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.766
Then it's not impossible, is it?

17:39.810 --> 17:42.521
Most of the work will be done
by the private sector,...

17:42.604 --> 17:47.651
..so there'll be a strategic division
of labour in order to maintain security.

17:47.734 --> 17:51.780
- Major Davis, could you also see to this?
- What is this?

17:51.864 --> 17:55.284
A few personal requirements
I'm sure the Pentagon will provide,...

17:55.367 --> 17:58.453
..given the nature
of my continued contributions.

17:58.537 --> 18:02.207
Please see that it gets approved
as soon as possible.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.962
Gentlemen.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.717
Personal requirements.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.146
Hey! What's goin' on?

18:25.981 --> 18:28.734
- What are you doin'?
- I know how this works now,...

18:28.817 --> 18:33.530
..but you need naqahdah in your blood
or you can't make it do anything.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.409
Have you considered that
maybe that's a good thing?

18:40.162 --> 18:44.458
- Something on your mind?
- Your behaviour, as a matter of fact.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.210
What about it?

18:46.293 --> 18:50.297
Well, for starters, who gave you the
authority to give orders around here?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.674
Actually, the Pentagon.

18:53.842 --> 18:58.639
Look, maybe I haven't been patient lately,
but I'm just doing what has to be done.

18:58.722 --> 19:02.559
I have the knowledge.
I have to make sure it gets used properly.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.437
I can elevate us to the point
of wiping out the Goa'uld...

19:05.521 --> 19:07.898
..or I can watch it all go to waste.

19:07.981 --> 19:11.068
You're under a lot of pressure.
I understand.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.905
I recommended you to oversee
the naqahdah retrieval.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.658
Oh, yeah,
thank you very much, by the way.

19:17.741 --> 19:20.410
I can either accept the position or retire.

19:20.661 --> 19:24.498
Why aren't you behind me on all this?
I'm finally taking your position.

19:24.623 --> 19:29.253
Let's... Iet's build weapons.
Let's... Iet's kick some Goa'uld ass!

19:32.339 --> 19:35.926
Because it's me saying it,
I'm suddenly a bad guy?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.890
Where's Teal'c?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.526
He's on a mission.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.737
- What mission?
- The one I sent him on.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.365
- When's he gonna be back?
- When he's done.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.492
Jack...

20:01.368 --> 20:03.829
I've got a lot of work to do.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.957
And so do you. So, please... help me...

20:08.959 --> 20:11.253
..or leave.

20:27.895 --> 20:29.938
(distorted groaning)

20:33.942 --> 20:36.653
Please, I beg you, have mercy.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.226
(car draws up)

21:39.675 --> 21:41.301
Morning, Dr Jackson.

21:41.426 --> 21:45.097
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs
is waiting for your 0900 briefing.

21:45.222 --> 21:49.601
You also have a message from NASA
about the AG's disbursement mechanism.

21:49.726 --> 21:51.937
- Are they on schedule yet?
- No.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.898
- Unbelievable.
- And Major Carter is here to see you.

21:54.982 --> 22:00.279
Send her away. And find out
why she still has a valid security pass.

22:00.362 --> 22:04.032
- Right away, Dr Jackson.
- Good morning, Dr Jackson.

22:06.577 --> 22:08.620
Morning, sir.

22:09.163 --> 22:11.707
What can I make for you
this morning, Dr Jackson?

22:11.832 --> 22:14.918
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course.

22:15.794 --> 22:19.464
Breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.593
- Oma teach you that?
- Television.

22:24.219 --> 22:26.847
Glad I've been such a positive influence.

22:27.264 --> 22:30.684
- Daniel!
- I'm sorry, Dr Jackson. She insisted.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.853
It's OK.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.400
You can't seriously think
you'll get away with this?

22:38.483 --> 22:42.321
- What are you talking about, Sam?
- What you're doing. What you've planned.

22:42.446 --> 22:47.493
That's why you had me removed from
the project. You knew I'd figure it out.

22:47.618 --> 22:52.164
I relieved you of your responsibilities
because you were starting to crack.

22:52.289 --> 22:55.000
You seem to have lost all perspective.

22:56.502 --> 22:59.671
Quite frankly,
I think your jealousy got the best of you.

22:59.755 --> 23:04.968
Jealousy? I'll tell you why it's hard
to maintain perspective, Daniel.

23:05.886 --> 23:08.514
Strategic division of labour.

23:08.597 --> 23:12.768
All in an effort to keep anyone
from seeing the big picture.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.067
What exactly have you figured out, Sam?

23:20.150 --> 23:23.070
You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

23:27.032 --> 23:30.452
- What have you done to him?
- You leave him out of this.

23:30.536 --> 23:34.289
- Can't you see what you've become?
- I didn't change, Sam. You did.

23:34.414 --> 23:36.959
You can't stop me telling people
what's going on.

23:37.084 --> 23:40.504
They'll listen.
You'll never get away with this!

23:41.922 --> 23:44.216
Is she insane?

24:04.903 --> 24:06.947
Sir, thank you for coming.

24:08.740 --> 24:12.661
- What are you doin', Carter?
- I'm trying to do what's right.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.038
I have talked to everyone I know.

24:15.122 --> 24:18.792
No one's answering my calls, responding
to my e-mails, even my letters.

24:18.876 --> 24:21.587
Because they think you're nuts.

24:23.005 --> 24:25.299
What do you think?

24:26.633 --> 24:32.806
This is Daniel. Sometimes he can be
a little... odd. He can get carried away.

24:32.890 --> 24:37.603
- But he's not gonna jeopardise the planet.
- I'm not so sure, sir.

24:38.020 --> 24:42.733
- A lot of very smart people believe in this.
- He's got them brainwashed.

24:42.858 --> 24:46.528
What about Teal'c?
You don't still blame Daniel for that?

24:46.653 --> 24:49.114
I couldn't prove anything. Can you?

24:50.407 --> 24:52.701
No.

24:53.452 --> 24:58.916
I just have my opinion. But that
used to be worth something to you.

25:01.293 --> 25:04.213
Carter, you helped Daniel
create these weapons.

25:04.296 --> 25:07.466
- I know.
- Well, what do you expect me to do?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.718
Talk to him.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.891
Sir, you have to try.

25:17.017 --> 25:20.187
Somebody has to stop him
before it's too late.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.745
Jack.

25:38.997 --> 25:41.041
Nice to see you.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.044
You too. It's been a while, huh?

25:46.797 --> 25:49.800
I love the place.
Love what you've done with it.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.845
- I'm sorry I haven't kept in touch.
- You've been busy.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.764
Well, we couldn't have done
any of this without you.

25:55.848 --> 25:59.768
- I should have been more appreciative.
- The fruit basket was nice.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.274
Can't be a coincidence you showed up
here the day of the launch.

26:05.399 --> 26:08.902
- Is that today?
- Yeah. That's supposed to be top-secret.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.405
Who knew?

26:12.656 --> 26:15.742
- You wanna stay and watch?
- Got a big screen?

26:18.495 --> 26:20.539
Come here.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.506
- Why?
- You'll see.

26:36.096 --> 26:37.723
What?

26:51.820 --> 26:54.573
Elevators are such a pain in the ass.

26:55.449 --> 26:58.452
(man) Tertiary systems are on line.

26:58.535 --> 27:01.622
(woman)
Activate all CC function software.

27:07.419 --> 27:08.921
What do you think?

27:09.004 --> 27:13.717
(woman) Commence calibration of
primary sensor arrays in five, four...

27:17.137 --> 27:19.932
It's cool. It's kinda like Vegas.

27:20.015 --> 27:23.268
We've got three to one odds
on the launch going without a hitch.

27:23.393 --> 27:27.439
- I'll take some of that action.
- Put Colonel O'Neill down for a hundred.

27:27.523 --> 27:30.692
- Got it.
- Dollars, right?

27:32.319 --> 27:36.698
I'm glad you're here. After what happened
to Teal'c, I thought I'd never see you.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.992
Oh, ancient history.

27:39.117 --> 27:42.871
Besides, I didn't want to miss
watching you save the world.

27:43.205 --> 27:47.751
Yeah. Actually,
Sam thinks I'm trying to take it over.

27:47.876 --> 27:51.547
- Oh, how arch.
- Yeah.

27:51.839 --> 27:55.509
- So you threw her in jail, huh?
- She was getting dangerous.

27:56.343 --> 28:01.473
You think the military didn't make sure
I couldn't just control everything?

28:01.765 --> 28:04.434
So... what is all this?

28:05.310 --> 28:11.567
Basically, a big-screen TV. So we can
watch and... fix things if it goes wrong.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.946
Dr Jackson, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs is on channel one.

28:18.198 --> 28:22.828
Congratulations, DrJackson.
We've all worked very hard for this day.

28:22.953 --> 28:25.497
Thank you, and congratulations to you.

28:25.581 --> 28:29.001
We're a go forlaunch.
Commencing 20-second countdown.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.087
All systems are go. The clock is running.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.673
We've got 24 delivery systems launching.

28:34.756 --> 28:39.887
Each one is carrying 12 AG-3's
that will disburse once they reach orbit.

28:43.891 --> 28:46.101
Five... four...

28:46.560 --> 28:48.520
..three... two...

28:49.271 --> 28:50.981
..one.

28:51.064 --> 28:53.358
Ignition.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.990
We have liftoff.

29:09.875 --> 29:13.212
Switching to disbursement
tracking system.

29:34.274 --> 29:38.320
- Disbursement in progress.
- AG monitoring system coming on line.

29:38.403 --> 29:41.031
All systems are functioning.

29:41.114 --> 29:43.408
The network is in place.

29:43.534 --> 29:45.994
That's it.

29:47.955 --> 29:50.249
Pay the winners.

30:01.134 --> 30:04.471
You sure? It's, uh... $2,000 a bottle.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.850
- No, thanks.
- Come on, Jack.

30:07.975 --> 30:11.728
- You're gonna be an international hero.
- What do you mean?

30:11.854 --> 30:15.107
Well, now that we can defend ourselves
against the Goa'uld,...

30:15.190 --> 30:19.903
..the president is gonna make the
Stargate's existence public knowledge.

30:19.987 --> 30:22.197
Dr Jackson...

30:22.281 --> 30:27.619
I'm Amy Jenson, live on Capitol Hill. The
president has postponed his address...

30:27.703 --> 30:30.539
..amid speculation about
an international crisis...

30:30.622 --> 30:36.253
..over the top-secret launch ofa new
satellite communications network.

30:36.336 --> 30:41.049
No statement from the White House yet,
but we assume one is forthcoming.

30:41.633 --> 30:45.762
- What's going on?
- The Russians have gone on high alert.

30:45.846 --> 30:47.973
The Chinese are following suit.

30:48.098 --> 30:52.019
The Russians are repositioning
one oftheiranti-satellite weapons.

30:52.144 --> 30:56.231
- They're gonna try and take out an AG-3.
- Did they respond to the statement?

30:56.315 --> 31:03.363
Theirparliament considers the secret
development ofthis alien technology...

31:03.489 --> 31:05.782
..to be a direct violation ofagreements...

31:05.866 --> 31:09.620
..to share all information garnered
through the Stargate programme.

31:09.745 --> 31:12.998
Unless control ofthis system
is relinquished immediately,...

31:13.123 --> 31:15.667
..it will be considered
an act ofaggression...

31:15.792 --> 31:17.836
..and will be responded to as such.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.923
- That's pretty much what we expected.
- Yes.

31:21.423 --> 31:25.469
My advice to the president would be
we have to demonstrate what we can do.

31:25.552 --> 31:29.806
I have suggested that to him already,
and the president agrees.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.896
Receiving authorisation
to target Russian satellite.

31:43.403 --> 31:47.241
We have target lock. System is firing.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.710
Target has been eliminated.

32:05.050 --> 32:08.971
Very effective.
Everyone here is quite impressed.

32:09.221 --> 32:11.265
Let's hope the Russians are.

32:11.390 --> 32:14.893
We predicted they would launch
more anti-satellite weapons.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.145
That's exactly what they're doing.

32:17.229 --> 32:20.482
I'm sure they're moving rockets
into position as we speak.

32:20.566 --> 32:24.736
- And your next step?
- We'll prepare a proportional response.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.157
I'm recommending
we take out theirlaunch site.

32:29.616 --> 32:34.329
Well, this is all leading to
a full-scale nuclear attack, isn't it?

32:34.413 --> 32:40.335
Unless we comply with their demands,
yes. That would be a high probability.

32:40.419 --> 32:43.130
Shouldn't we just nip this in the bud?

32:44.006 --> 32:48.802
Given ourability to defend ourselves,
we don't see the need tojump the gun.

32:48.886 --> 32:53.515
The president is rethinking ourposition
on unilateral control ofthe system.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.684
I see.

33:05.485 --> 33:09.239
- What are you doing?
- The president is failing to overcome...

33:09.323 --> 33:15.496
..a lack of necessary leadership abilities.
So I'm preventing a global nuclear war.

33:15.621 --> 33:18.957
You shouldn't be able to do this.
You can't do this.

33:19.041 --> 33:23.504
I've already done this. This bunker is well
protected. Don't think about attacking.

33:23.587 --> 33:25.464
DrJackson!

33:25.547 --> 33:29.760
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I've had enough of that guy.

33:31.220 --> 33:33.263
Daniel, what are you doing?

33:34.014 --> 33:38.644
Proportional response makes sense when
the field is even. We have an advantage.

33:38.727 --> 33:42.564
The problem is the other side
just doesn't realise how wide the gap is.

33:42.648 --> 33:47.444
- What they really need is a visual aid.
- AG system targeting Moscow.

33:50.823 --> 33:52.199
- Daniel.
- Don't worry.

33:52.282 --> 33:55.953
There's no threat of residual radiation.
It's quick and clean.

33:56.078 --> 33:59.414
Like cutting your enemy's heart out
with a scalpel.

34:17.808 --> 34:22.855
Didn't you think it was a little strange you
got through security with a loaded gun?

34:22.980 --> 34:24.940
A little.

34:27.650 --> 34:30.320
You never were that bright.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.324
No.

34:46.628 --> 34:49.797
Daniel,
think about one thing before you do this.

34:50.632 --> 34:53.635
We never proved that kid was a Harsesis.

34:55.971 --> 34:59.391
- What are you talking about?
- Everything he put in your head.

34:59.474 --> 35:02.644
The Goa'uld have used
mind control before.

35:03.478 --> 35:06.481
You think this is a Goa'uld plot
to get me to destroy the world?

35:06.565 --> 35:09.026
We've seen 'em use kids too.

35:10.903 --> 35:14.823
Use Shifu to put stuff in my head
in order to get me to build the weapons,...

35:14.948 --> 35:19.328
- ..only to eventually turn them on Earth?
- It's possible.

35:19.411 --> 35:22.289
There's only one flaw in that theory.

35:24.750 --> 35:28.670
You're assuming this is not
what I wanted all along.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.797
Don't. Don't.

35:37.137 --> 35:39.431
System is firing.

35:54.655 --> 35:57.324
Target has been eliminated.

36:16.552 --> 36:18.929
- Still nothin'?
- No.

36:19.054 --> 36:22.391
There's nothing physically wrong
with him. Nothing I can find.

36:22.474 --> 36:25.727
- Except for the fact that he's in a coma.
- It's not really a coma.

36:25.853 --> 36:28.397
He still has rapid eye movement.

36:38.323 --> 36:42.244
The fact is...
he may not be the Harsesis at all.

36:43.412 --> 36:47.082
Are you saying this could be
some sort of Goa'uld trick?

36:47.207 --> 36:51.920
As we have seen, the Goa'uld are not
above using human children as weapons.

36:52.212 --> 36:55.966
Well, all Shifu would say
is that he is teaching Daniel.

36:57.009 --> 36:59.678
So, what do we do?

36:59.761 --> 37:04.308
As you know, the Zatarc detector's
original purpose was to detect deception.

37:04.433 --> 37:08.270
We could at least determine whether
the boy is actually Harsesis,...

37:08.353 --> 37:12.399
- ..and maybe what he did to Dr Jackson.
- Basically a lie detector test.

37:12.482 --> 37:14.526
- No harm would come to him.
- And what?

37:14.651 --> 37:17.738
Just hope he doesn't explode
in the meantime?

37:18.655 --> 37:21.200
Hope he really is who he says he is.

37:22.242 --> 37:25.162
And maybe help Dr Jackson.

37:33.128 --> 37:37.925
It's just a precaution. I had this done
to me once, and I had to wear them too.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.636
The mind is always free.

37:43.805 --> 37:47.643
This will hurt a little.
After that I promise you will feel no pain.

37:47.726 --> 37:53.565
- I will merely ask you some questions.
- Questions are plentiful. Answers are few.

37:53.649 --> 37:56.652
I'll try and keep it simple. Ready?

38:16.630 --> 38:18.924
Direct your vision here.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.103
First question. What is your name?

38:31.228 --> 38:32.813
Shifu.

38:32.896 --> 38:36.567
- Are you Harsesis?
- I am many things.

38:37.860 --> 38:41.780
Do you possess the genetic knowledge
passed on to you by Apophis?

38:41.905 --> 38:43.157
Yes.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.828
What did you do to Daniel?

38:47.911 --> 38:51.748
Dreams sometimes teach.
I am teaching him.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.459
Teaching him what?

38:54.585 --> 38:56.628
That the true nature of a man...

38:56.753 --> 39:02.676
..is determined in the battle between his
conscious mind and his subconscious.

39:02.759 --> 39:07.556
And that the evil in my subconscious
is too strong to resist.

39:11.935 --> 39:14.855
The only way to win is to deny it battle.

39:20.319 --> 39:22.779
As Oma teaches.

39:25.741 --> 39:28.202
He woke up a few minutes ago.

39:29.119 --> 39:33.582
One of these days I'm gonna figure out
if she's worth listening to.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.504
- What happened?
- I was having a dream.

39:39.421 --> 39:41.965
- About what?
- That's not really important.

39:42.090 --> 39:48.514
The... important thing is...
it's time I chose a new path.

39:48.847 --> 39:52.100
And it is time for me to continue on mine.

39:52.226 --> 39:56.605
- Wait a minute. If he really is Harsesis...
- He is.

39:56.897 --> 40:00.234
..we can still extract
valuable information from him.

40:00.400 --> 40:03.028
No, you can't.

40:04.822 --> 40:07.449
- I don't understand.
- I know.

40:10.202 --> 40:12.579
Thank you for telling me of my mother.

40:12.704 --> 40:16.834
- She would have very proud of you.
- Of you as well.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.340
Will I see you again?

40:23.423 --> 40:26.844
All roads eventually lead to the great path.

40:28.345 --> 40:30.222
Eventually.

40:30.347 --> 40:32.558
Many cross on the way.

40:43.152 --> 40:45.946
What's going on?
We're not just gonna let him leave.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.574
I don't think we have a choice.

41:04.548 --> 41:06.592
(alarm)

41:09.595 --> 41:14.474
General, order all personnel to stand
down and get the heck outta the way.

41:14.558 --> 41:18.228
- Are you sure, Colonel?
- The alternative might not be so pretty.

41:18.353 --> 41:20.647
What am I supposed to say?

41:23.942 --> 41:27.362
All personnel, this is General Hammond.

41:27.446 --> 41:30.532
A... glowing energy being...

41:31.033 --> 41:35.662
..is headed forlevel 28. We believe
it's heading for the gate room.

41:35.746 --> 41:39.416
Loweryour weapons and
do not attempt to intercept it.

41:48.884 --> 41:51.178
The gate just opened, sir.
