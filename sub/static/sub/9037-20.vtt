WEBVTT

00:03.103 --> 00:05.637
- [singing]
take me out for some t-ball

00:05.639 --> 00:09.108
Take me out
for some fun

00:09.110 --> 00:10.275
It's just
like baseball

00:10.277 --> 00:13.545
But you hit it
off a tee

00:13.547 --> 00:14.546
It's all little kids

00:14.548 --> 00:17.383
So there's no injury

00:17.385 --> 00:19.351
Ha.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.220
Rhymes, come on, huh?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.621
Let's go.
Are you ready?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.323
- No, because every time
I turn around,

00:24.325 --> 00:27.226
This one takes
his clothes off.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.794
- You know, ray, when we
signed up for t-ball,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.796
You promised me that you'd
be home early from work

00:30.798 --> 00:31.796
So you could help me,

00:31.798 --> 00:33.132
And I had to get
everything ready.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.466
I had to get them dressed,

00:34.468 --> 00:36.802
I had to get the team snack,
everything.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.037
- I had to write that song.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.539
- Yeah, right.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.341
- And you didn't hear
the next verse.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.044
[singing]
my wife debra is so nice

00:45.046 --> 00:48.280
She is real pretty too

00:48.282 --> 00:52.251
- Ally, I'm gonna need
that bat.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.420
- [singing]
she's sexy, she's skinny

00:54.422 --> 00:58.490
Her breath is real good

00:58.492 --> 01:01.226
We don't have as much sex
as we should

01:07.667 --> 01:09.701
- Look how cute
they are.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.637
- Oh, good catch!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.472
Yeah, wow.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.274
- Hey, you got a gold glover
out there, raymond.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.842
- Yeah, she's like a boy, huh?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.578
- Yeah, only smarter.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.246
- Hey, hey!
Ally tagged him out!

01:21.248 --> 01:22.648
What's he still doing out there?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.283
Hey, kid!

01:24.285 --> 01:26.452
Sit down!
You're out!

01:26.454 --> 01:28.487
- Dad, he's not out, okay?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.289
Nobody's out.
Those are the rules.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.290
It's okay.

01:31.292 --> 01:34.159
Don't cry, little boy.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.160
- That's stupid.

01:35.162 --> 01:36.495
How do you win?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.763
- You don't win, okay?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.665
It's not like when
we played little league.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.699
This teaches them the skills
without the pressure.

01:40.701 --> 01:44.470
- And humiliation.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.138
- You know what you
should do, raymond?

01:46.140 --> 01:47.873
You're a big sports columnist.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.409
You should do a column
on t-ball for newsday.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.511
- Yeah, sure,
right after my article

01:52.513 --> 01:55.114
On running
through the sprinkler.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.850
- Well, it's better
than just sports.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.586
It's about families
spending time together.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.321
You'd be writing
about something you love.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.860
- Hi.
Hi, are you, uh, ray?

02:07.862 --> 02:08.861
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:08.863 --> 02:09.862
- Bryan trenberth.

02:09.864 --> 02:11.163
I just wanted to make sure

02:11.165 --> 02:13.198
You remembered
the, uh, team snack?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.700
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
we took care of it.

02:14.702 --> 02:18.570
- Well, it is almost
the fourth inning.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.605
- Yeah?

02:19.607 --> 02:20.839
- Well, I think
it's a good idea

02:20.841 --> 02:22.641
To have each snack item
laid out

02:22.643 --> 02:25.144
By the top
of the fourth inning, don't you?

02:25.146 --> 02:26.578
I think it's a good idea.
I think that's best.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.280
- Okay. All right.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.681
Deb, we're supposed
to put the snacks out now.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.681
- Oh, okay.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.217
Marie, can you take
both the boys

02:32.219 --> 02:34.153
Over to the sandbox?

02:34.155 --> 02:36.522
Oh, make sure michael
keeps his clothes on, okay?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.624
- Oh, yeah, sand.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.624
That gets irritating.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.897
- I can help you,
uh, Debra, is it?

02:44.899 --> 02:46.198
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.533
You know what, debra?

02:47.535 --> 02:48.734
I think it would
be a good idea

02:48.736 --> 02:52.404
If we laid
everything out right now.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.205
- This is everything.

02:53.207 --> 02:57.776
- [scoffs]

02:57.778 --> 03:00.279
I'm sorry, uh...

03:00.281 --> 03:01.947
I'm confused.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.615
- Honey, how's
the snack situation?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.784
- Well, uh,
here's the concern.

03:05.786 --> 03:10.422
All we seem
to have today are pretzels.

03:10.424 --> 03:14.326
- And hawaiian punch.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.327
- Oh, god.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.595
Got some things in the car.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.397
- Um...

03:18.399 --> 03:20.599
Excuse me, but I don't see
what the big deal is.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.700
We're supposed
to bring a snack,

03:21.702 --> 03:24.469
And pretzels
are a snack, right?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.206
- Does say "snack"
right on the box there.

03:27.208 --> 03:31.343
- Yes, it does, but I believe
I sent you a printout,

03:31.345 --> 03:35.314
And it says,
"a healthy team snack

03:35.316 --> 03:37.983
Will be provided by parents
on a rotating basis,"

03:37.985 --> 03:39.318
And here's you,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.986
And here's the approved
snack list,

03:40.988 --> 03:43.622
And...

03:43.624 --> 03:45.757
No pretzels.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.460
- It doesn't say
"no pretzels."

03:48.462 --> 03:50.796
- I'm sorry.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.664
Maybe you
misunderstood me.

03:52.666 --> 03:56.335
There are no pretzels

03:56.337 --> 03:59.271
On the list
of approved snacks.

04:01.808 --> 04:02.774
- He's right.
He's right.

04:02.776 --> 04:03.942
There are
no pretzels there.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.844
- Well, I never saw the list.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.313
- I sent you
an orientation pack.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.648
A big, blue folder?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.383
- Okay, we're sorry here.
We're very sorry.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.352
- Well, now, wait a minute.
We're not that sorry.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.420
I mean, come on, it's a snack.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.757
- Okay, I mean,
it's no big deal.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.392
There's no reason
to almost yell.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.030
- I'm not almost yelling.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.932
Look, I'm juggling
three kids under seven.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.434
I don't have time
to cater a t-ball game.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.403
- Well, I'm sorry,

04:31.405 --> 04:33.972
But you do seem
to be getting quite upset

04:33.974 --> 04:36.275
Over what should be
a minor issue.

04:36.277 --> 04:39.845
[laughs]

04:39.847 --> 04:41.980
- Excuse me, but you're the one

04:41.982 --> 04:44.916
Who's freaking out
over a box of pretzels.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.618
- Deb, nobody's freaking,
all right?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.654
It's your first game,
you didn't know what to bring,

04:48.656 --> 04:50.422
And you took a shot
with the pretzels.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.324
- Here we go!

04:52.326 --> 04:54.660
Apples, trail mix, and kiwis.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.761
- Oh, that's good.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.029
Good.
Good idea.

04:57.031 --> 04:58.430
Kiwi.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.431
Look, it's fuzzy.

04:59.433 --> 05:00.532
- Stop it, ray.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.434
- It's a very good job, lisa,

05:02.436 --> 05:05.604
And since we ended up
doing the snacks this week,

05:05.606 --> 05:08.640
Uh, debra and ray will just
take our spot next week, okay?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.741
- Okay, all right,
we'll do that.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.543
- Wait, no,
that's not okay.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.545
Okay, this is not about giving
the kids something to eat.

05:13.547 --> 05:17.516
This is about some uptight guy
on a power trip.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.884
You know what, bryan?

05:18.886 --> 05:22.487
Our snack is pretzels.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.722
- Well, uh...

05:23.724 --> 05:26.358
I'm sorry, uh...

05:26.360 --> 05:28.894
Maybe you're not
the kind of people

05:28.896 --> 05:33.699
We should be sharing
the t-ball experience with.

05:33.701 --> 05:34.700
- No.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.668
- Excuse me, what did you say?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.103
- We're good people.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.438
No, we'll do it.
We'll bring the snack.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.439
- Ray.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.439
- What? I just--

05:43.676 --> 05:44.810
All right,
I'm sorry about this.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.345
We'll take care
of all this.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.913
- I hope so.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.848
I mean, after all, we're here
for the children, right?

05:49.850 --> 05:50.849
- Mm-hmm.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.064
- Will you look at that?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.632
Will you just look at that?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.868
Now, where's
that child's parents?

06:17.677 --> 06:18.844
- Yeah, listen,

06:18.846 --> 06:19.844
I got another snack list,

06:19.846 --> 06:21.913
And I think
if we just bring, like--

06:21.915 --> 06:23.715
Like carrots and celery
next week,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.450
Then everybody'll be happy.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.120
Except the kids.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.655
- We are not bringing
anything.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.392
- No, no, look, look, you won't
have to do anything, okay?

06:33.394 --> 06:35.060
We'll get the bag
with the carrots and celery

06:35.062 --> 06:36.695
Already cut up and washed.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.697
I think they even throw
radishes in there.

06:38.699 --> 06:39.898
Oh, wait.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.900
Radishes aren't on the list.

06:41.902 --> 06:42.901
- Maybe we should--

06:44.871 --> 06:48.840
- We are not
bringing a snack.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.142
[garbage disposal grumbles]

06:56.082 --> 07:00.085
- That was the list.

07:00.087 --> 07:03.722
I can't ask bryan
for a third list.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.558
- Why do you care
about that pompous little ass?

07:11.164 --> 07:14.032
- Okay, he's not
your type of person, okay?

07:14.034 --> 07:16.034
But there's no reason
to yell at him.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.736
He's just doing his job.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.638
- Snacks at t-ball
is not his job.

07:19.640 --> 07:23.175
He's an optician.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.877
- Exactly why
you shouldn't yell at him.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.512
It's volunteer work.

07:27.514 --> 07:30.015
- I cannot believe
that you took his side.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.216
- Well, he has a point.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.684
I mean, pretzels
weren't on the list.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.853
- Ray, I don't care

07:34.855 --> 07:37.589
If I put out a bowl
of rocks today, okay?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.757
We are married!

07:38.759 --> 07:40.125
If somebody talks
to your wife that way,

07:40.127 --> 07:43.829
You're supposed
to support her!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.730
- What if the wife
is almost yelling?

07:47.867 --> 07:50.469
- I was standing up
for myself.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.204
- Yeah.

07:52.206 --> 07:53.505
Why do you do that?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.907
- Oh, god.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.542
- It's like
when I was a kid

07:57.544 --> 07:58.777
And I'd be with my parents,

07:58.779 --> 08:00.779
And they'd get
in these shouting matches,

08:00.781 --> 08:02.214
And not just with each other.

08:02.216 --> 08:06.485
With regular people.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.087
We'd be out, and they'd yell
at the salesman

08:09.089 --> 08:12.190
Or the waiter
or the tollbooth guy,

08:12.192 --> 08:14.893
And the cars
behind us are honking,

08:14.895 --> 08:19.898
And my father's screaming,
"pennies are money!"

08:19.900 --> 08:23.101
And the guy in the truck
behind us gets out, and...

08:24.937 --> 08:26.972
- Ray.
Ray.

08:26.974 --> 08:31.676
I'm sorry about
your whole life,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.979
But I'm not gonna
let that guy intimidate me.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.848
- Oh, don't make a thing!

08:38.985 --> 08:42.988
- You know, ray, why do
you need everybody to like you?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.723
- What?

08:44.725 --> 08:47.092
- You know, you can never make
a scene about anything

08:47.094 --> 08:49.561
Because god forbid
somebody doesn't like you.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.699
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

08:54.701 --> 08:55.967
So I'm likable.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.136
Okay, isn't that why
you like me?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.137
- I love you.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.139
I have to like you.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.977
Just, next week,
when we show up without a snack,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.312
Could you please back me up?

09:07.314 --> 09:11.316
- Okay, if it means
that much to you.

09:11.318 --> 09:15.887
Or we could just
quit t-ball.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.790
It's not like ally's
gonna turn pro or anything.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.559
- You are unbelievable!

09:20.561 --> 09:23.795
Why can't you just say,
"hi, bryan trenberth,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.697
"I don't care
if you like me or not,

09:25.699 --> 09:27.132
"but we didn't bring
a snack this week

09:27.134 --> 09:29.200
"because my wife
is as busy as hell,

09:29.202 --> 09:31.736
"and she brought a perfectly
fine snack last week,

09:31.738 --> 09:33.138
"and if it's not
on your stupid list,

09:33.140 --> 09:35.307
"uh...I'm sorry,

09:35.309 --> 09:39.077
But that's
your problem."

09:39.079 --> 09:42.981
- I don't really
talk like that.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.215
- Yeah.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.585
That's too bad.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.053
- Hey,

09:48.055 --> 09:51.089
You know what everybody's
gonna call us, don't you?

09:51.091 --> 09:53.592
"mr. And mrs. Pretzel."

09:53.594 --> 09:54.659
Yeah.

09:54.661 --> 09:55.660
Get ready.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.135
- Hey, come on.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.637
Let's get to the game.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.905
- Oh, you're coming again?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.807
Great.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.175
- Listen, you know that

10:10.177 --> 10:12.611
"nobody wins,
everybody has fun" crap?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.983
That ends today.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.951
I'm keeping score.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.087
- Dad, no,
it's not about the score.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.055
- Then why the hell bother?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.191
- 'cause it's family fun!

10:26.193 --> 10:27.993
Just stop.
Put it away, all right?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.260
I got enough trouble.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.863
- What are you
so worried about?

10:31.865 --> 10:35.066
That little weenie
with the clipboard?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.235
We had guys
like that in korea.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.070
Second lieutenants.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.306
College guys.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.743
Platoons hated their guts.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.078
You know what
happened to them?

10:47.080 --> 10:51.016
You know what
friendly fire is?

10:51.018 --> 10:52.951
Well, sometimes
it wasn't so friendly.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.854
- They killed
their own guys?

10:55.856 --> 10:58.189
- Not always.

10:58.191 --> 11:01.660
Sometimes they'd just
send them back to college,

11:01.662 --> 11:03.728
To the ones
without a lot of steps.

11:03.730 --> 11:06.297
[chuckles]

11:06.299 --> 11:07.297
- So your advice to me

11:07.299 --> 11:09.734
Is I should, uh,
shoot bryan trenberth

11:09.736 --> 11:12.203
Over a box of pretzels
at a kids' t-ball game.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.172
- Oh, right, the kids.

11:17.710 --> 11:18.977
- You know, dad,
you're not obligated

11:18.979 --> 11:20.712
To come to these games

11:20.714 --> 11:23.815
Or talk to me.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.083
- All I'm saying

11:25.085 --> 11:27.118
Is you don't let people
push you around

11:27.120 --> 11:29.688
Unless you want your children
to think their father is...

11:37.863 --> 11:40.265
- How great would it be
if you just took off?

11:42.835 --> 11:45.136
- Dad, are we going?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.204
Mom wants to know how long

11:46.206 --> 11:47.305
You're gonna
leave us in the car.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.442
- Look, tell your brother,

11:50.444 --> 11:52.444
Have you ever seen me
back down from anybody?

11:52.446 --> 11:53.445
- No, sir.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.847
Pennies are money.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.783
- Dad wants me to murder
bryan trenberth.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.353
- No, don't.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.955
Bryan's a great guy.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.757
Very organized.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.992
He's getting me
some sunglasses.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.495
- Yeah, I know.
He's a good guy.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.863
Debra's all,

12:11.865 --> 12:13.031
"we're not bringing a snack.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.432
We brought a snack."

12:14.434 --> 12:17.836
Yeah, well,
I'm bringing a snack,

12:17.838 --> 12:19.204
And a good one.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.772
- Wait.
Wait a minute.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.775
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

12:23.777 --> 12:28.313
The clipboard weenie guy
tells you to bring a snack,

12:28.315 --> 12:31.983
Your wife tells you
not to bring a snack,

12:31.985 --> 12:34.052
And you're bringing a snack!

12:35.921 --> 12:37.088
Fire in the hole!

12:50.069 --> 12:51.069
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I saw that.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.070
Funny.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.307
Yeah, yeah.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.176
No chance of one of you
diving on that, is there?

13:03.516 --> 13:05.250
Listen, it's our turn
to bring a snack.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.185
I think I'm doing
the right thing here, okay?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.386
And debra'll see that.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.421
- Oh, yeah,
she'll see that.

13:13.225 --> 13:15.059
- Come on, dad,
let's get a good seat.

13:15.061 --> 13:15.960
I want to see that too.

13:23.235 --> 13:24.369
- Psst.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.570
You want to know
what the score is?

13:25.572 --> 13:26.838
- Dad.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.239
- 57 to 48.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.308
- Stop it.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.043
Who's winning?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.444
- They are,

13:33.446 --> 13:35.446
And you can thank
weenie's kid.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.015
He's got six errors.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.449
- Yeah, okay, dad.

13:38.451 --> 13:41.953
It's like having
venus de milo in right field.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.555
- He's five.

13:43.557 --> 13:45.190
- Man, if we could
just trade him.

13:47.459 --> 13:50.328
- Oh, look at him
trying not to look at us.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.596
- Will you just
take it easy?

13:51.598 --> 13:53.498
He's allowed to look, okay?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.967
Try being nice.

13:55.969 --> 13:56.968
- Oh, yeah, just--

13:56.970 --> 13:58.303
Just come on down here.

13:58.305 --> 14:02.907
Just say one word to me.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.175
- Take it easy.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.276
- Why don't you
blow him a kiss?

14:07.446 --> 14:09.581
- Oh, where you
throwing that ball?

14:09.583 --> 14:11.049
Come on!

14:11.051 --> 14:13.218
Have an idea out there!

14:18.057 --> 14:19.324
- Dad...

14:19.326 --> 14:22.260
Others.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.562
- Michael's naked.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.431
- Oh, no, deb,
you want to see

14:26.433 --> 14:28.199
If maybe you can help
my mom a little bit?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.434
- Yeah, oh, look at her.
She's stuck.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.536
Who wears high heels
in a sandbox?

14:36.308 --> 14:37.508
- [whispering]
bryan.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.977
Come here.

14:38.979 --> 14:39.978
- What are you doing?

14:39.980 --> 14:40.979
- Shh.

14:40.981 --> 14:41.980
Come here, come here...

14:44.316 --> 14:47.919
- Hi, uh, ray.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.420
- Snack.
- What?

14:49.422 --> 14:50.421
- Snack.
Snack.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.224
I got the snack.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.461
- Oh, oh, oh, oh,
that's very nice.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.629
Why are you whispering?

14:57.631 --> 14:59.631
- Because it's real good.

14:59.633 --> 15:00.999
I don't want
the kids mobbing us, okay?

15:01.001 --> 15:04.035
So go get it.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.236
- Uh, what?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.237
- Get it.
Under the bleachers,

15:06.239 --> 15:07.438
The gym bag.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.439
- Oh.

15:08.441 --> 15:09.240
Oh, okay.

15:12.211 --> 15:13.678
- He hid it
under the bleachers.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.547
- Gutsy move.

15:16.549 --> 15:18.316
- Ohh...

15:18.318 --> 15:20.151
This looks very good.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.552
- Yeah, yeah,
it's good, it's good.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.321
It's all very good,
okay, so go set it up.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.455
Set it up over there,

15:24.457 --> 15:26.224
And you take all the credit.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.026
- Oh, no, no.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.028
It looks like you
went to a lot of trouble here.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.331
Look at--
tangerines, breadsticks,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.667
String cheese,
granola bars.

15:35.669 --> 15:36.968
- Don't count it, man.

15:36.970 --> 15:37.568
It's all there.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.514
- This is everything
on the list.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.249
- Yeah.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.217
So take it.
Take it away.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.218
Go, good.
It's everything.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.220
Good, everybody's happy now.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.255
- Here comes debra.

16:04.530 --> 16:07.632
- Michael thinks
it's a nude beach.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.500
Hi, bryan.
- Hi, debra.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.337
I just have to say,
this is really wonderful.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.105
- What is?
- The snack.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.440
They got a really
good snack this week.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.141
Okay, hey,
that's good for you.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.409
- What, is he rubbing it in?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.278
- Debra, come on.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.046
- I'm sorry,
rubbing what in?

16:22.048 --> 16:23.214
- Oh, that you found someone

16:23.216 --> 16:25.750
To bring a list-approved
snack this week.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.518
- The point's not
who brought it, right?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.220
It's that it's here
for the kids.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.022
Isn't that it?
Isn't it all about the kids?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.657
- All about the kids.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.159
- That won't save him.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.228
- That's what
I'm trying to say, ray,

16:37.230 --> 16:38.730
And I just want
to thank you and debra.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.498
- Okay. It's okay.
It's all right. Thanks.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.532
- Thank us for what?

16:41.534 --> 16:43.368
- Debra, come on,
just drop it.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.602
- Bryan trenberth

16:44.604 --> 16:48.006
Does not let a good deed
go unnoticed.

16:48.008 --> 16:48.639
- Please do.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.078
- Ray, what is he talking about?
- Nothing.

16:54.080 --> 16:57.115
- I'm talking about
the beautiful snack today.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.116
- We didn't bring a snack.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.417
- Ray just gave it to me.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.620
- Will you shut up
about the snack!

17:02.622 --> 17:03.620
All right?

17:03.622 --> 17:06.391
Just shut up about the stupid,
freaking snack!

17:06.393 --> 17:09.327
Here! Here!
You want the snack?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.762
Here, take it.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.397
Take all of it.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.066
Here, are these
healthy enough for you?

17:15.068 --> 17:16.601
Plantains!

17:16.603 --> 17:20.071
You couldn't just put
bananas on the list, huh?

17:20.073 --> 17:21.071
I ate 2 of these

17:21.073 --> 17:22.740
Before I found out
you got to cook them!

17:27.146 --> 17:28.746
- I'm sorry, I--

17:28.748 --> 17:29.746
- What, what, what, what?

17:29.748 --> 17:31.549
You don't want to share
t-ball with me?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.551
Well, guess what, I don't want
to share t-ball with you,

17:33.553 --> 17:35.586
Bryyy.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.121
Oh, by the way,

17:37.123 --> 17:39.157
Your kid's costing us
the game out there, okay?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.224
Yeah, yeah,
that's right.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.360
I'm keeping score.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.262
Ooh, bad!

17:44.264 --> 17:46.297
I'm keeping score,
and we're losing

17:46.299 --> 17:50.101
Because your kid's out there
eating grasshoppers, okay?

17:50.103 --> 17:53.471
I don't think that's
an approved snack!

18:25.137 --> 18:26.671
- Sorry, bryan.

18:32.244 --> 18:33.644
- You don't have
to do snacks anymore.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.223
- I don't know what
happened out there.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.357
- Well, you can
watch it all later.

18:46.359 --> 18:50.428
Greenberg's
got it all on video.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.629
"too hot for t-ball."

18:51.631 --> 18:52.630
- Yeah.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.899
All right.

18:54.901 --> 18:55.900
Sorry.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.602
Sorry you had to see that.

18:57.604 --> 18:58.903
- Oh, you know,

18:58.905 --> 19:01.439
I was proud and ashamed
at the same time.

19:04.576 --> 19:07.411
- Well, one thing
you don't have to worry about...

19:07.413 --> 19:08.479
Nobody likes me anymore.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.482
- Yeah.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.384
You know, I didn't mean I wanted
them to stop liking you

19:13.386 --> 19:15.920
All in one day.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.723
Thought it could be
kind of a gradual thing.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.724
- I got to tell you,

19:19.726 --> 19:22.426
That was scary today, you know?

19:22.428 --> 19:25.530
I never go off
on people like that.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.466
I mean, my father
lets go all the time, you know?

19:28.468 --> 19:30.334
He gets it out.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.604
I'm sicker than him.

19:33.606 --> 19:37.175
I'm like a time bomb.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.876
Don't you worry
that at any moment

19:38.878 --> 19:41.312
I could go off like that
on you sometime?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.880
- Pff, yeah.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.881
- What?

19:43.883 --> 19:44.882
No, I mean it.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.551
- Ooh...

19:46.553 --> 19:48.619
- Come on!

19:48.621 --> 19:49.687
What?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.688
Don't.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.290
I'm dangerous.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.291
I throw fruit.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.595
- I still like you.

19:57.597 --> 19:59.597
- Yeah, 'cause you're
scared of me.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.472
- Turn around then.

20:08.474 --> 20:09.473
There you go.

20:09.475 --> 20:10.975
Good job.

20:10.977 --> 20:11.976
- Aren't they cute?

20:11.978 --> 20:13.744
- Yeah, yeah.
Cute.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.380
Let's just hope
the pants stay on.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.282
- Okay, everybody,
it's snack time.

20:18.284 --> 20:21.619
[children cheering]

20:21.621 --> 20:23.254
- Whose turn was it
to bring snack?

20:23.256 --> 20:25.223
- I got it today.

20:25.225 --> 20:28.926
- Here, everybody.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.562
Oh, now,
the lasagna is hot.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.663
Be careful.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.699
So we'll start
with the antipasto,

20:34.701 --> 20:36.334
And if everything
is finished,

20:36.336 --> 20:39.370
We have cannolis.

20:39.372 --> 20:41.272
- Wow, ray, this is
the best snack I've ever seen.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.273
You're unbelievable.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.308
- Well, you know...

20:44.310 --> 20:45.576
It's all about the kids.
