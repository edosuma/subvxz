Your Cowboys got crushed
last night.

00:21.603 --> 00:23.610
For the love of God,
Reagan, don't bring that up.

00:23.698 --> 00:24.868
He's been sulking all day.

00:24.956 --> 00:26.462
I wasn't sulking.

00:26.550 --> 00:28.900
The caller said they found
the body in the courtyard?

00:31.478 --> 00:33.480
Looks like the caller
didn't stick around.

00:35.689 --> 00:37.313
I think he's still breathing.

00:38.491 --> 00:40.052
<i>Whoa!
God!</i>

00:40.441 --> 00:42.046
<i>- Quick, over here.
- Get down.</i>

00:42.718 --> 00:44.000
Wayne!

00:45.312 --> 00:46.867
Stay down.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.335
Come on.
Stick with me, okay?

00:50.423 --> 00:52.335
Central, Two-Nine Sergeant.
10-13, 10-13.

00:52.423 --> 00:54.458
- I got an EMT shot. Shots fired
- <i>Wayne...</i>

00:54.546 --> 00:55.632
at the Bitterman Complex.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.031
Mary's waiting for you.
The kids are waiting for you.

00:58.181 --> 00:59.368
You've got to get home,
okay, Wayne?

00:59.455 --> 01:00.703
They're waiting for you
at home.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.663
Come on.
Stick with me, okay?

01:02.756 --> 01:04.046
Katrina, your shoulder.

01:04.134 --> 01:06.585
Katrina, you're hit.
Wayne, stick with me.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.171
Wayne, Wayne,
we got to get you home, okay?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.898
We're gonna
get you home.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.613
ADA Reagan,
what's your recommendation

01:18.700 --> 01:21.185
- on a plea to the charge?
- Your Honor,

01:21.273 --> 01:23.835
although drug possession
is a nonviolent crime,

01:23.922 --> 01:26.403
Mr. Siriani has many priors.

01:26.490 --> 01:28.294
His actions
demonstrate that

01:28.382 --> 01:30.169
he is a threat
to the community,

01:30.257 --> 01:32.812
and significant jail time
is necessary.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.555
The court hears
your recommendation, Counselor.

01:35.642 --> 01:38.031
- Thank you.
- But we will be rejecting it.

01:38.328 --> 01:39.374
Your Honor?

01:39.462 --> 01:40.968
This court believes
in rehabilitation

01:41.056 --> 01:42.351
over incarceration.

01:42.971 --> 01:45.000
I'm sending this case
to drug treatment court,

01:45.088 --> 01:47.671
so Mr. Siriani may have
a chance at the former.

01:47.759 --> 01:48.953
- Rehab, Your Honor?
- Yes.

01:49.056 --> 01:50.797
But he has assault
on his record.

01:50.885 --> 01:53.367
You've already made
your argument, ADA Reagan.

01:53.672 --> 01:56.664
Now you have my ruling.
That'll be all.

02:02.508 --> 02:06.052
Do you really think rehab is appropriate,
Judge Harvey?

02:06.140 --> 02:08.601
You know, I'd forgotten what
it was like working with you

02:08.687 --> 02:10.193
for one precious moment.

02:10.281 --> 02:12.919
Well, I haven't,
and you never would have let him walk

02:13.007 --> 02:14.078
as an ADA.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.178
I'm not a prosecutor anymore,
as you may have noticed.

02:16.265 --> 02:18.785
But if you were,
you would have pushed for

02:18.872 --> 02:21.156
a much harsher sentence
than I did.

02:21.244 --> 02:22.615
Times have changed.

02:22.702 --> 02:25.242
Addiction is an illness,
rehab the appropriate response.

02:25.330 --> 02:27.408
But not with a history
of violence.

02:27.496 --> 02:28.945
He'll be locked
in a 24-hour clinic.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.119
He should be
locked up in jail.

02:31.244 --> 02:33.375
Look, just because
we worked together

02:33.463 --> 02:36.057
doesn't mean you get to
come in here and strong-arm me.

02:36.869 --> 02:38.477
I'm just trying
to understand

02:38.565 --> 02:41.025
how you just let
a violent offender walk.

02:41.112 --> 02:42.705
I chose the bench, Erin.

02:42.853 --> 02:44.641
From what I understand,
you could have, too,

02:44.729 --> 02:45.943
but you didn't.

02:46.244 --> 02:47.758
What is that supposed to mean?

02:47.846 --> 02:49.815
It means
I'm the judge here.

02:50.019 --> 02:53.022
And it's my judgment
that matters, not yours.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.500
Now, I'm sorry, but I have
more important cases

02:55.588 --> 02:57.174
than this one to attend to.

03:03.701 --> 03:04.938
Jamie.

03:05.026 --> 03:06.198
Hey.

03:06.945 --> 03:08.965
Hey. You okay, boss?

03:09.053 --> 03:10.557
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

03:10.645 --> 03:11.867
What are you guys
doing here?

03:11.955 --> 03:15.364
We caught a, uh, EMT homicide
recently ourselves.

03:15.451 --> 03:17.627
- You think there's a connection?
- Same M.O.

03:17.714 --> 03:18.976
There's been a pattern
of ambulances

03:19.063 --> 03:20.369
getting baited and hit recently.

03:20.456 --> 03:22.327
What for?
Narcotics.

03:22.414 --> 03:25.002
- That's an elaborate way to score drugs.
- Well, they're not using 'em.

03:25.089 --> 03:26.403
They're selling 'em.
There's a lot of money

03:26.490 --> 03:27.822
in the back of them buses.

03:27.910 --> 03:30.402
Well, I got a good look at
the guy who was playing dead.

03:30.490 --> 03:32.381
We can sit down with a sketch
artist when you're ready.

03:32.468 --> 03:33.425
Okay, I'm ready.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.011
You're ready?
You sure?

03:35.949 --> 03:37.908
Yeah, look,
I didn't know Wayne that well,

03:37.995 --> 03:39.751
but I've seen him save
more than one life.

03:39.839 --> 03:41.613
So whoever did this,
I want to get 'em.

03:41.701 --> 03:42.722
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:42.810 --> 03:45.393
Look, we appreciate
your help, okay,

03:45.481 --> 03:46.873
but we got it from here.

03:46.996 --> 03:48.395
Look, yeah, I know
the lay of the land,

03:48.482 --> 03:49.876
- so I can help.
- You could've fooled me.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.184
You just almost
got yourself shot.

03:51.271 --> 03:53.605
Why don't you just fall back?
I'm fine, Danny.

04:09.380 --> 04:10.582
Black, one sugar.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.464
Thank you.

04:15.510 --> 04:16.570
Mr. Mayor.

04:16.658 --> 04:18.183
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Frank.

04:18.271 --> 04:19.486
Sit, sit.

04:27.273 --> 04:30.943
So... it was a nice
inauguration.

04:31.068 --> 04:32.490
Very nice.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.888
But just the calm
before the storm,

04:34.976 --> 04:36.044
as it turns out.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.621
Hey, it's 44 degrees
and sunny outside.

04:38.708 --> 04:40.558
This holiday season,
year to year,

04:40.646 --> 04:42.841
hotel occupancies are
down seven percent,

04:42.997 --> 04:45.638
and overall tourist revenue
is down ten percent.

04:45.787 --> 04:50.115
Well... I'm not really
much of a finance guy.

04:50.218 --> 04:51.981
Well, the holidays are
supposed to be a time

04:52.069 --> 04:54.552
of joy and cheer...
and cash flow.

04:54.947 --> 04:56.253
And optimism.

04:56.488 --> 04:59.473
Especially optimism.
Crime rates were down.

05:00.060 --> 05:01.411
Petty crime was up.

05:01.985 --> 05:04.568
Ass-grabbing Elmos
in Times Square... up.

05:04.656 --> 05:07.441
Assaults by homeless
zombies... up.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.565
And we are proactive,
but we can't be everywhere.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.622
Which means, in practice,
that you're reactive,

05:12.710 --> 05:14.326
already behind the curve.

05:14.636 --> 05:16.349
It's not a curve, Mr. Mayor.

05:16.437 --> 05:20.841
It's eight million-plus citizens
who aren't always upstanding.

05:20.976 --> 05:23.055
- Then manage it.
- I do manage it.

05:23.143 --> 05:24.693
Within bounds?

05:25.122 --> 05:26.560
Within the law.

05:27.529 --> 05:28.919
Hmm.

05:29.006 --> 05:30.921
I'm changing
the vagrancy laws.

05:32.451 --> 05:33.935
Mr. Mayor...

05:34.818 --> 05:37.513
you can't just change
the law.

05:38.044 --> 05:39.116
Watch me.

05:39.203 --> 05:40.349
Watch you what?

05:40.437 --> 05:44.510
Vagrancy Enforcement 332.10
stipulates that the police

05:44.598 --> 05:46.296
can forcibly remove
a homeless person

05:46.384 --> 05:47.996
from the street when
the temperature drops

05:48.083 --> 05:50.338
below 32 degrees.
For their safety.

05:50.436 --> 05:52.377
The agency that sets
that threshold

05:52.465 --> 05:53.987
answers to the mayor.

05:56.996 --> 05:58.425
And the new threshold?

05:59.371 --> 06:00.902
49 degrees.

06:03.806 --> 06:04.941
Seriously?

06:05.746 --> 06:07.652
I'm taking the cuffs off you
so you can

06:07.740 --> 06:09.386
take 'em off
your men and women.

06:09.839 --> 06:11.894
So it's just a cattle drive.

06:11.997 --> 06:15.722
It's a sweep that every
honest taxpayer in this city

06:15.810 --> 06:17.269
is going to applaud you for.

06:17.804 --> 06:19.410
And it starts tomorrow night.

06:21.417 --> 06:24.160
Excuse me, you expect me
to mount an operation

06:24.248 --> 06:25.380
of this scale...

06:25.468 --> 06:28.128
Yes. And with all your
lights and sirens.

06:28.371 --> 06:30.480
I'd like to see it
on the news at 11:00.

06:30.568 --> 06:31.786
Just say it loud.

06:32.132 --> 06:33.960
"There's a new sheriff in town."

06:35.135 --> 06:37.854
Actually,
there's a new mayor in town.

06:38.377 --> 06:40.278
The sheriff's been here
a while.

06:42.387 --> 06:44.885
I'll take it
under consideration.

06:45.051 --> 06:46.051
Consideration?

06:46.171 --> 06:48.046
All due consideration.

06:49.147 --> 06:53.190
Frank, I'm giving you
the tools you've always wanted.

06:53.686 --> 06:55.975
All I'm asking in return
is that you use them.

06:56.062 --> 06:57.421
Copy that.

06:59.695 --> 07:01.684
And I'd remind you
what we agreed to

07:01.772 --> 07:03.124
when we last met.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.427
What you say goes.
Copy that, too.

07:47.639 --> 07:49.022
Captain.

07:49.663 --> 07:51.653
Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

07:51.741 --> 07:52.950
Reagan?
Jamie's brother?

07:53.038 --> 07:54.249
Yeah, that one.

07:54.826 --> 07:56.678
I owe him big-time.

07:57.471 --> 07:58.809
I'll be sure to let him know.

07:58.951 --> 08:00.107
How's she doing?

08:00.225 --> 08:01.639
She's in shock.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.934
But still found it in her
to tell me how your brother

08:04.022 --> 08:05.999
saved her life;
she's grateful, so am I.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.060
Good. Well, we're just gonna
ask her a few questions.

08:08.147 --> 08:09.678
Oh, no, no, no.
Not now.

08:10.717 --> 08:12.848
We need to get the story
while it's fresh in her head.

08:12.936 --> 08:14.116
Do you mind?

08:14.459 --> 08:15.490
What the hell are you doing?

08:15.577 --> 08:17.169
Imagine one of you saw
the other get killed.

08:17.256 --> 08:18.583
Do you think you'd
want to relive that

08:18.670 --> 08:20.270
in front of a total stranger
right after?

08:20.358 --> 08:22.023
I don't know, but if somebody
killed my partner,

08:22.110 --> 08:23.802
I'd be willing to swallow
whatever pill I had to

08:23.889 --> 08:25.764
to find the son of a bitch
who did it.

08:26.163 --> 08:29.014
I'm pretty sure she'd be willing
to do the same for her partner.

08:31.732 --> 08:34.169
With all due respect,
would you step aside, please?

08:40.409 --> 08:41.856
And you didn't see anyone else

08:41.943 --> 08:43.760
besides the perp
pretending to be dead?

08:44.412 --> 08:46.522
No. Just him.

08:47.357 --> 08:49.513
And then
there were gunshots.

08:49.763 --> 08:53.740
And... after that, it's all a blur.

08:55.350 --> 08:57.897
Okay. Thank you
for your time.

08:58.334 --> 08:59.686
Just one last question.

09:00.241 --> 09:03.194
Why is it that you have
your captain guarding the door?

09:03.649 --> 09:07.051
Uh, Captain Higgins is
a little overprotective

09:07.139 --> 09:08.373
sometimes.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.944
He's like a father figure.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.874
Sounds like a healthy
work relationship.

09:12.061 --> 09:14.473
Or maybe he just didn't
want us to see you

09:14.561 --> 09:15.811
for some reason.

09:15.975 --> 09:17.108
What do you mean?

09:17.196 --> 09:19.418
Well, it takes a certain
expertise to access

09:19.506 --> 09:21.256
the back of one
of those ambulances.

09:21.419 --> 09:22.762
Which means,
in all likelihood,

09:22.850 --> 09:24.981
- an EMT was involved.
- Higgins?

09:25.069 --> 09:26.741
I mean,
he would never...

09:27.186 --> 09:28.849
Then why didn't he want
us to talk to you?

09:29.038 --> 09:30.506
He's a good guy.

09:30.601 --> 09:32.200
I mean, he's made
mistakes, but...

09:32.288 --> 09:33.998
What mistakes?

09:36.467 --> 09:37.819
I don't know.

09:38.497 --> 09:40.034
Never mind.

09:40.639 --> 09:43.285
Is there something we should
know about Captain Higgins

09:43.373 --> 09:44.819
that you're not telling us?

09:45.756 --> 09:47.819
No. Nothing.

09:48.563 --> 09:51.459
And I'm not saying
anything else without a lawyer.

09:58.798 --> 10:00.104
Really?

10:00.192 --> 10:01.344
Williamsburg?

10:01.432 --> 10:03.092
Restaurants and
hipster shopping.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.184
Tribeca but not Chinatown?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.254
They sweep their own sidewalks.
I got to hand it to the mayor.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.458
This is a pretty smart grid
if you want to make New York

10:10.545 --> 10:12.825
look like a college campus
on parents weekend.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.194
Long Island City.
Wow.

10:15.319 --> 10:17.854
A minute ago, there was nothing
there but rats and hookers.

10:17.941 --> 10:20.340
Now it's waterfront condos
and voting millennials.

10:20.428 --> 10:22.975
You know what's not on here?
Our area.

10:23.063 --> 10:24.991
Police headquarters, City Hall.

10:25.897 --> 10:27.975
No one stays, eats
or clubs here.

10:28.244 --> 10:29.756
"Goes clubbing here."

10:32.650 --> 10:34.379
- Right.
- Hey, guys,

10:34.467 --> 10:35.480
guess what.

10:35.788 --> 10:36.917
This is great news.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.285
For who?
The Chamber of Commerce?

10:38.373 --> 10:40.270
The I Heart New York chairwoman?

10:40.358 --> 10:44.504
For us. Boss, our guys walking
the beat are gonna love this.

10:44.764 --> 10:47.121
I don't know one of 'em,
it don't burn their tail

10:47.209 --> 10:49.965
that they got to dance around
all those human land mines.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.098
But tomorrow night?
What's the big rush?

10:52.186 --> 10:54.160
Ten years we've been
waiting for the mayor

10:54.248 --> 10:56.366
to say "take the gloves off."

10:56.522 --> 10:57.851
I would not
call that a rush.

10:57.938 --> 11:00.639
But New York isn't the same city
it was ten years ago.

11:00.889 --> 11:05.465
Which is exactly why I asked him
to let me hold this policy up

11:05.553 --> 11:07.303
against the new landscape.

11:07.528 --> 11:08.942
And he denied you?

11:09.514 --> 11:13.825
More like, if I even considered
taking a second glance,

11:13.913 --> 11:15.651
I'd be denying him.

11:16.123 --> 11:18.327
We start this sweep
all of a sudden,

11:18.452 --> 11:19.811
it's gonna look like payback.

11:19.899 --> 11:21.310
So make sure
it doesn't look like that.

11:21.397 --> 11:22.317
It's not that easy.

11:22.405 --> 11:23.764
You can't handle it?

11:24.155 --> 11:25.506
Of course he can.

11:27.677 --> 11:29.853
This may be at cost to our standing
in the community.

11:29.941 --> 11:31.856
What,
the hobo community?

11:31.944 --> 11:33.702
No one says hobo
anymore.

11:35.498 --> 11:38.231
Well, we will have
to handle the blowback

11:38.319 --> 11:41.197
because we are going
to execute this operation,

11:41.506 --> 11:43.934
because it is exactly
the kind of promise

11:44.022 --> 11:46.028
that got him elected
by a landslide.

11:46.170 --> 11:50.119
In that sense, we are
giving the people what they want.

11:51.608 --> 11:53.209
And not for nothing, boss,

11:53.296 --> 11:56.084
the mayor's giving our cops
what theywant.

11:59.471 --> 12:00.998
That, too.

12:05.751 --> 12:07.100
Hey.

12:07.764 --> 12:09.772
This doesn't make any sense.

12:10.185 --> 12:11.170
I mean, you remember

12:11.258 --> 12:13.538
what Judge Harvey
was like as an ADA.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.231
We used to call her
the Iron Maiden.

12:15.319 --> 12:16.709
Yeah, she took no prisoners.

12:16.797 --> 12:17.967
She was scary.

12:18.055 --> 12:20.535
She always pushed
for the maximum sentence.

12:20.623 --> 12:21.585
Really scary.

12:21.672 --> 12:24.405
Second scariest ADA
I ever worked with.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.623
- Maybe she's playing politics?
- How?

12:28.514 --> 12:31.356
Changing her tune
now that she's a public figure.

12:31.444 --> 12:32.723
No jail time

12:32.811 --> 12:34.641
for any crime
that could be spun as petty.

12:34.905 --> 12:36.530
- Doesn't make sense.
- I know.

12:36.618 --> 12:39.006
That's what's bothering me.
None of this makes sense.

12:39.094 --> 12:42.116
It's so clear that
Siriani should be kept off the streets.

12:42.232 --> 12:44.461
Yeah, uh,
about that.

12:46.076 --> 12:47.381
What?

12:48.116 --> 12:49.194
Well, he's back on 'em.

12:49.282 --> 12:52.364
Skipped out of rehab last night,
uh, he's been M.I.A. since.

12:52.452 --> 12:54.522
He didn't even last
a day?

12:55.066 --> 12:56.850
We're gonna find out
what happened

12:56.938 --> 12:59.030
and where he might
be going next.

12:59.397 --> 13:01.973
Erin, we can't go
after every drug user

13:02.061 --> 13:04.147
every time they relapse.

13:04.497 --> 13:06.381
Come on.
Let it go.

13:07.897 --> 13:11.983
So, I read online that
I get a $500 incentive

13:12.071 --> 13:13.507
'cause I recruited this guy.

13:13.595 --> 13:17.108
Uh, w-we get a $500 incentive,
considering all accounts

13:17.196 --> 13:19.434
and credit cards
are officially combined.

13:19.522 --> 13:20.577
That's right.

13:20.665 --> 13:22.512
So I'll just print this out
for you to sign

13:22.600 --> 13:24.039
and we'll be
on our way.

13:27.647 --> 13:28.772
Uh...

13:28.975 --> 13:33.373
How are you ever gonna be able
to buy me a secret gift?

13:33.944 --> 13:35.108
Guess I can't.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.756
Oh, no.

13:37.248 --> 13:38.836
I think
I need to cancel this.

13:38.923 --> 13:41.522
Or you could just
not go digging for it.

13:41.873 --> 13:44.631
We both know
that's not an option.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.694
Hey, what, um,
what's this other account?

13:48.782 --> 13:51.506
Oh, that's just some
old savings account.

13:51.594 --> 13:52.508
I-It's nothing, really.

13:52.596 --> 13:53.989
A hundred grand?

13:54.077 --> 13:55.506
That's not nothing.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.520
Why wouldn't
you tell me about that?

13:57.608 --> 13:59.857
I-It's not really mine.

13:59.951 --> 14:01.213
Whose is it?

14:02.446 --> 14:03.788
My dad's.

14:07.543 --> 14:09.937
I already gave their
descriptions to the police.

14:10.148 --> 14:11.497
Their descriptions?

14:11.585 --> 14:13.826
So it wasn't just
Siriani who escaped?

14:13.914 --> 14:16.569
No, he recruited another user.
Harris Hicks.

14:16.663 --> 14:17.944
It's a shame, really.

14:18.032 --> 14:19.598
Why?
Who's Harris Hicks?

14:19.975 --> 14:22.371
A young patient
who was showing signs of recovery.

14:22.459 --> 14:23.827
The courts
don't understand.

14:23.915 --> 14:27.209
When you dump a hard-core user
like Siriani into the tank,

14:27.297 --> 14:29.053
it pollutes the rest
of the water.

14:29.381 --> 14:31.756
You have any idea of
where they were headed?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.530
I left that job
to the cops.

14:33.686 --> 14:35.413
Little busy here
with my own job.

14:35.501 --> 14:38.209
So busy you let him escape
on the first day.

14:38.687 --> 14:41.092
We knew
Siriani was a flight risk,

14:41.236 --> 14:43.093
but with all the patients
we've had thrown at us,

14:43.180 --> 14:44.443
we couldn't keep
a close enough eye.

14:44.530 --> 14:46.785
You knew he was a risk
from his record?

14:46.873 --> 14:48.373
That, and we were warned.

14:48.702 --> 14:50.952
- By who?
- Someone from the courthouse called.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.670
Don't remember who exactly.

14:53.696 --> 14:54.915
Thank you.

14:55.608 --> 14:56.817
Hey.

14:56.905 --> 14:58.405
You were right.
There was an attempted

14:58.493 --> 15:00.592
armed robbery
at St. Irene's Hospital.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.170
Two perps attempted to steal,
uh, drugs at gunpoint.

15:04.311 --> 15:05.998
They both got away
empty-handed.

15:06.086 --> 15:07.262
And one of the descriptions

15:07.350 --> 15:08.444
matches Siriani?

15:08.570 --> 15:10.975
Yeah. And they're both
still at large.

15:19.782 --> 15:21.180
Captain Higgins.

15:23.395 --> 15:24.623
Not again.

15:24.711 --> 15:26.766
- Good to see you, too.
- What do you want?

15:26.961 --> 15:29.469
We want to take a look
at your personnel logs.

15:29.563 --> 15:30.563
Why?

15:30.651 --> 15:32.961
We're looking for patterns
in ambulance deployment.

15:33.049 --> 15:35.078
And the personnel logs?
Why would you need those?

15:35.166 --> 15:37.109
Captain, this isn't
Twenty Questions.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.287
You think
an EMT's involved?

15:41.797 --> 15:43.766
Oh, you two have got
a sense of humor.

15:43.857 --> 15:45.662
Actually, we don't have
a sense of humor.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.889
Not when a New York City
cop almost got killed.

15:47.977 --> 15:49.201
Almost got killed.

15:49.289 --> 15:51.654
It's EMTs who are dying out there,
let me remind you.

15:51.742 --> 15:54.257
Yeah, actually, we're gonna need
to see your personal files, too.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.186
What, you think
I'm involved?

15:56.274 --> 15:57.524
Are you?

15:57.612 --> 16:00.528
Cops aren't the only ones with
a sense of loyalty, you know.

16:00.686 --> 16:02.391
We'd never set each other up.

16:02.479 --> 16:04.210
I'd never set up
one of my guys.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.778
Good. Then you shouldn't have a
problem giving us what we want.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.008
Not a chance.

16:08.096 --> 16:09.545
Sound like obstructing to you?

16:09.633 --> 16:11.024
- Sure does.
- It's not,

16:11.180 --> 16:12.785
unless you got
a subpoena.

16:12.872 --> 16:17.805
Oh, actually, now that you
mention it, uh... I do.

16:25.362 --> 16:27.688
Got a load of
whites in the dryer,

16:27.776 --> 16:29.272
the sheets need changing,

16:29.360 --> 16:30.788
and don't forget
to change the duvet.

16:30.875 --> 16:33.283
Oh, that's my least
favorite job.

16:33.370 --> 16:35.391
That is everyone's
least favorite job.

16:35.479 --> 16:36.929
Sarge, you still interested
in working

16:37.016 --> 16:38.240
that, uh, tour Saturday?

16:38.328 --> 16:39.860
Uh, yes.
Thank you, Marisol.

16:39.948 --> 16:41.367
You're working
weekends now?

16:41.672 --> 16:43.083
Yeah, just the one, for now.

16:43.171 --> 16:45.086
Why? We hardly see
each other as it is.

16:45.174 --> 16:47.662
Well, I had a ten-year plan
to pay off my student loan debt,

16:47.750 --> 16:48.804
but that's when
I was a bachelor.

16:48.891 --> 16:50.857
And now that we might
want a family,

16:50.945 --> 16:52.047
I'm gonna cut that
in half.

16:52.135 --> 16:54.303
So what, we're not gonna see
each other for five years?

16:54.391 --> 16:55.618
No, I'm just taking on
a little more,

16:55.705 --> 16:57.162
get us a little closer
to that goal.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.623
Well, I can help.

16:58.711 --> 17:00.740
No, this is not your debt,
Eddie. It's mine.

17:00.828 --> 17:03.787
- What's yours is mine now.
- Yeah, but not this.

17:03.875 --> 17:05.390
I mean, you didn't go
to three years of law school

17:05.477 --> 17:06.938
to not make
a lawyer's salary.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.276
Well, if you'd become a lawyer,
you never would've met me.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.482
Harvard education: $300,000.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.555
A lifetime with you: priceless.

17:13.648 --> 17:15.825
$300,000?

17:15.982 --> 17:18.328
I got about a third
of it left, yeah.

17:19.335 --> 17:22.556
We could, we could use
the money from my dad.

17:22.673 --> 17:23.587
No, Eddie...

17:23.675 --> 17:25.781
W-We don't know that it's dirty.

17:25.868 --> 17:27.468
Based on the fact
that you haven't used it,

17:27.555 --> 17:28.945
I think that you think
it is.

17:29.033 --> 17:31.210
Okay, I admit
I don't trust my dad.

17:31.298 --> 17:32.727
And certainly not his money.

17:32.815 --> 17:35.594
But this is our future
we're talking about here.

17:35.682 --> 17:37.741
Okay, but what about the future
of those people whose lives

17:37.828 --> 17:39.233
were affected
by your father's schemes?

17:39.320 --> 17:40.884
I mean, maybe that money
belongs to them.

17:40.971 --> 17:42.298
Oh, I'm sure they've
been taken care of.

17:42.385 --> 17:43.577
Really?
Did the government claw back

17:43.664 --> 17:44.751
money for their reparations?

17:44.838 --> 17:47.537
Claw back?
I-I don't know.

17:47.992 --> 17:49.693
Look, I've got this
under control.

17:49.781 --> 17:51.783
Don't worry about it,
okay?

17:58.804 --> 18:01.623
A homeless man died
in custody last night

18:01.711 --> 18:03.563
during the sweep
in Williamsburg.

18:06.700 --> 18:07.975
Okay.

18:08.901 --> 18:10.250
Cause of death?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.137
M.E. ruled it a heart attack.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.771
Any evidence, that our guys
were rough with him?

18:14.859 --> 18:16.662
No,
but it doesn't matter.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.318
The fact that they were forcing
him to a shelter is enough.

18:19.406 --> 18:22.365
But he was clearly
in bad health to begin with.

18:24.342 --> 18:26.137
But he was
also a beloved fixture

18:26.225 --> 18:27.824
on Bedford Street
for years.

18:27.912 --> 18:30.240
They're gonna say the NYPD
caused his death.

18:30.328 --> 18:32.467
Yes, I can handle
the fallout.

18:32.810 --> 18:33.857
How?

18:34.830 --> 18:36.217
How?

18:36.886 --> 18:39.777
If you put it out there
that we're just making good

18:39.865 --> 18:42.282
on one of the mayor's
campaign promises,

18:42.369 --> 18:45.443
that's not handling it,
that's passing the buck.

18:45.818 --> 18:46.873
You're good.

18:46.977 --> 18:49.241
No, I've just known you
for a long time.

18:49.592 --> 18:50.600
Well, how, then?

18:50.688 --> 18:53.422
Well, I-I'm sure some
of our guys got scuffed up,

18:53.510 --> 18:55.475
maybe stuck
with needles.

18:55.563 --> 18:57.818
Concede there were injuries
on both sides.

18:57.906 --> 18:59.168
I don't have that information.

18:59.256 --> 19:01.258
Well, Sid does.
Where's Sid?

19:02.445 --> 19:04.193
He's out checking
on some of the precincts

19:04.281 --> 19:05.450
that carried out
the operation.

19:05.537 --> 19:07.350
I'm sure
he'll be back soon.

19:08.162 --> 19:12.442
Okay, when he gets back,
download his war stories

19:12.529 --> 19:15.794
from the sweep
and use it to shore up our side.

19:15.881 --> 19:17.663
Why are you so certain
he's gonna have war stories?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.361
It's Sid.
He's gonna have stories

19:19.449 --> 19:21.170
that make our cops
look like heroes.

19:21.258 --> 19:22.560
Are they gonna be true?

19:24.926 --> 19:26.529
I hope so.

19:28.009 --> 19:30.021
So you didn't recognize
anybody in the lineup?

19:30.109 --> 19:32.378
I think I'd remember the guy who
tried to lure me to my death.

19:32.465 --> 19:35.337
Fair enough. All right, well,
thanks for coming down.

19:35.596 --> 19:37.059
Well, can I help you
with something else?

19:37.146 --> 19:39.600
No. I appreciate all
you've done so far. It's good.

19:39.687 --> 19:41.810
Sure? Seems like
you could use the help.

19:42.255 --> 19:43.473
What is that supposed
to mean?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.217
Well, that lineup was
kind of a Hail Mary.

19:45.305 --> 19:47.795
Well, we have other avenues
we're pursuing, you know.

19:47.883 --> 19:49.189
You still looking at
the EMTs?

19:49.277 --> 19:51.191
- Who told you that?
- Higgins.

19:51.279 --> 19:53.396
He called me, thanked me and
cursed you in the same breath.

19:53.483 --> 19:54.740
Higgins, huh?
Okay, good.

19:54.828 --> 19:57.657
Well, now, he just shot up to
the top of my list of suspects.

19:57.745 --> 19:58.998
Always guilty until proven

19:59.085 --> 20:00.458
- innocent in your book.
- What, you don't find it

20:00.545 --> 20:02.191
suspicious that
Higgins is trying

20:02.279 --> 20:03.646
to derail
my investigation?

20:03.734 --> 20:05.450
He said he was gonna
comply with the subpoena.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.928
We'll see about that.

20:07.016 --> 20:09.560
I just don't think he's capable
of something like this.

20:09.648 --> 20:11.302
And I didn't ask you
what you think.

20:11.390 --> 20:13.247
- Now, thanks for coming down.
- Hey, Danny, come on.

20:13.334 --> 20:14.998
I was there.
I know the players.

20:15.086 --> 20:16.913
Mm-hmm. I think you know
the players a little too good.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.778
Maybe you're getting a little
close to this, huh?

20:18.865 --> 20:20.107
When's that
ever stopped you?

20:20.195 --> 20:22.023
Well, since when
do you want to be like me?

20:22.111 --> 20:24.498
Would you stop trying
to protect me and let me help.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.654
Come on.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.888
Excuse me.

20:45.976 --> 20:48.584
- I'm looking for Mr. Wallace.
- Who's asking?

20:49.389 --> 20:51.857
- You know, it'll just be a sec.
- Excuse me.

20:53.329 --> 20:55.537
You can give your case
to Elaine out front.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.537
Oh, I don't have a case.

20:59.015 --> 21:00.320
What now, Officer?

21:00.463 --> 21:02.748
I'm just
here to talk to you.

21:02.836 --> 21:04.706
We got everything in order,
as usual.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.362
This is a personal matter.

21:08.450 --> 21:09.550
Mm-hmm.

21:09.638 --> 21:13.409
You represented my dad,

21:13.581 --> 21:15.331
Armin Janko.

21:17.803 --> 21:19.417
You're Armin's daughter?

21:20.245 --> 21:21.571
I am.

21:21.831 --> 21:23.753
Oh, wow.

21:24.636 --> 21:27.214
It is great
to meet you, kid.

21:27.530 --> 21:29.596
I have heard
so much about you.

21:29.728 --> 21:31.164
You have?
Course.

21:31.252 --> 21:32.198
Do you know how
many hours I spent

21:32.286 --> 21:34.115
- with your old man?
- I'm gonna go with a lot,

21:34.202 --> 21:36.633
considering how many lawsuits
he had against him.

21:36.721 --> 21:37.548
I could hardly get

21:37.636 --> 21:39.829
a word in when he was bragging
about his little girl.

21:39.917 --> 21:42.081
He didn't care about
wasting billable hours.

21:42.169 --> 21:43.249
Really?

21:43.337 --> 21:45.971
Please sit down.
What can I do for you, sweetheart?

21:46.066 --> 21:50.026
Well, um...
he left me this trust.

21:50.114 --> 21:52.595
I know.
Good man.

21:53.564 --> 21:55.822
Well, I was wondering
if it would be possible

21:55.919 --> 21:58.448
to go through the files
you have on him.

21:59.487 --> 22:00.915
You want to know
if it's clean.

22:01.002 --> 22:02.214
Yeah.

22:02.403 --> 22:04.479
- Piece of advice?
- Sure.

22:05.768 --> 22:08.542
Don't go looking for things
you don't want to find.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.409
Judge Harvey.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.432
ADA Reagan, I'd love to chat,

22:15.519 --> 22:17.159
- but I have a hearing to get to.
- Siriani cut out

22:17.246 --> 22:18.362
of rehab yesterday

22:18.450 --> 22:20.301
with a young patient
he recruited.

22:20.434 --> 22:23.168
They're the leading suspects
in an attempted armed robbery.

22:23.387 --> 22:25.457
You come all this way to say,
"I told you so"?

22:25.545 --> 22:29.157
No. For help on where
Siriani might go next.

22:29.245 --> 22:30.986
Why would I be able
to help with that?

22:31.074 --> 22:32.917
'Cause you grew
up together.

22:33.746 --> 22:35.495
You were neighbors.

22:38.539 --> 22:40.073
Closer,

22:40.886 --> 22:42.698
almost like siblings.

22:43.610 --> 22:44.737
Has he hurt anyone?

22:44.841 --> 22:46.464
Not yet.
He won't.

22:46.552 --> 22:48.378
He's a good person, Erin.

22:48.466 --> 22:51.644
He's an unstable person
with a drug problem and a gun.

22:51.792 --> 22:53.925
A gun? No, no, no.
That doesn't make any sense.

22:54.013 --> 22:56.198
It does to me.
He's got a history of violence.

22:56.286 --> 22:57.505
Assault in a bar

22:57.593 --> 22:58.973
and armed robbery
aren't exactly the same...

22:59.060 --> 23:01.062
Come on, Cheryl,
you keep covering for this guy

23:01.150 --> 23:02.847
and someone's gonna
end up dead.

23:07.004 --> 23:10.268
It's-it's not like he told me
where he shot up.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.323
Okay, what about
St. Irene's?

23:12.411 --> 23:14.620
I mean, a hospital
isn't the first place

23:14.708 --> 23:16.589
an addict looks to score.

23:17.956 --> 23:20.948
A hospital is where he got
hooked in the first place.

23:21.979 --> 23:23.084
How?

23:23.401 --> 23:24.808
He was a nurse.

23:25.143 --> 23:27.188
Practiced at St. Irene's
and a few others.

23:27.276 --> 23:28.886
A few others?

23:29.718 --> 23:31.155
I'm gonna need a list,

23:31.243 --> 23:34.511
starting with the ones
closest to St. Irene's.

23:35.425 --> 23:36.815
And another thing,

23:37.565 --> 23:39.284
I'll need a warrant.

23:48.199 --> 23:50.769
That Higgins
is a real hothead.

23:51.019 --> 23:52.298
And you're so
calm and cool?

23:52.386 --> 23:54.095
Like the other side
of the pillow.

23:54.229 --> 23:55.284
Right.

23:55.372 --> 23:57.445
Can't believe he actually
complied with the subpoena

23:57.533 --> 23:58.964
and sent all this
stuff over here.

23:59.052 --> 24:00.395
Well, I get why
he wouldn't want to.

24:00.482 --> 24:03.987
Cheated OT hours, the number
of saves his team made.

24:04.408 --> 24:06.018
I don't see anything
that suggests

24:06.106 --> 24:07.891
he was involved
in the robberies, though.

24:07.978 --> 24:10.675
No, but take a look at this.

24:11.151 --> 24:13.501
Something seems off
with Wayne and Katrina's

24:13.589 --> 24:16.128
inventory, like
it's been doctored.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.386
They were
stealing drugs

24:18.474 --> 24:19.558
from their own bus?

24:19.646 --> 24:21.737
But they were the ones
who were shot at.

24:21.825 --> 24:23.391
- Wayne's our victim, remember?
- Yeah.

24:23.479 --> 24:27.235
And Katrina's also been keeping
secrets from us the entire time.

24:27.323 --> 24:28.902
I'm just saying,
maybe we got to step it up

24:28.989 --> 24:30.479
with her, get her down here
without a lawyer.

24:30.566 --> 24:31.862
How you gonna do that?

24:32.401 --> 24:35.120
Could do it by tapping the
person who just saved her life.

24:35.526 --> 24:37.268
You better do it quick.
Why?

24:37.355 --> 24:39.144
Another bus
just got hit.

24:47.940 --> 24:50.696
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:50.799 --> 24:51.940
Big case?

24:53.011 --> 24:54.417
My dad's case.

24:55.057 --> 24:56.095
Eddie...

24:56.183 --> 24:58.897
Hear me out, some of these
investments are real.

24:58.985 --> 25:01.379
The money wasn't
necessarily "clawed back,"

25:01.466 --> 25:03.808
although I'm not totally sure
what that even means.

25:03.896 --> 25:05.762
It's a legal term
for forcing money away from...

25:05.849 --> 25:07.329
But it looks like
this particular money

25:07.416 --> 25:09.447
wasn't taken back because
it was part of a tech investment

25:09.534 --> 25:10.644
that went really big.

25:10.732 --> 25:13.313
Okay, well, where'd the initial
seed money come from?

25:13.401 --> 25:15.263
I'm not exactly sure,
but my point is,

25:15.350 --> 25:16.917
we know more than
we don't know.

25:17.276 --> 25:18.875
Hey, look, I know
it must be hard for you

25:18.962 --> 25:20.284
with your dad being...

25:20.899 --> 25:22.847
Being what?

25:22.972 --> 25:25.206
- You know.
- No, tell me.

25:26.236 --> 25:28.542
I just mean that,

25:28.630 --> 25:30.917
you know,
you're not like your father.

25:31.005 --> 25:32.839
Would it be so bad
if I was?

25:32.927 --> 25:34.954
No, of course not.
I'm just saying, you know,

25:35.042 --> 25:36.346
you don't have to live
with his mistakes.

25:36.433 --> 25:37.815
Was he perfect?
No,

25:37.903 --> 25:40.036
but nobody is as perfect
as your family.

25:40.124 --> 25:41.308
I didn't say that.

25:41.396 --> 25:44.008
He worked really hard.
He gave me a good life,

25:44.650 --> 25:46.771
even though it wasn't always
inside the lines.

25:47.050 --> 25:49.472
Eddie, we don't need
to take that money.

25:49.560 --> 25:50.784
I'll figure it out.

25:53.616 --> 25:54.671
Fine.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.324
If you turn the page,
you'll see your...

26:00.412 --> 26:02.416
CCRB has called
an emergency meeting

26:02.504 --> 26:03.817
concerning the sweep.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.340
What, so? They call everything
an emergency.

26:06.428 --> 26:08.082
You know what
CCRB stands for?

26:08.170 --> 26:09.629
Civilian's Complaint
Review Board.

26:09.717 --> 26:13.152
Cranky Crybabies Review Board.
What's their beef this time?

26:13.240 --> 26:14.763
That we're just
moving the homeless

26:14.851 --> 26:17.713
from the commercial districts to
the residential neighborhoods.

26:17.801 --> 26:19.918
Which is, in fact,
true.

26:20.048 --> 26:23.559
When the shelters fill up,
there will always be spillover.

26:24.285 --> 26:25.471
I need Sid.

26:25.559 --> 26:26.840
He's unavailable.

26:27.457 --> 26:30.309
How can he be unavailable
when I need him?

26:32.035 --> 26:33.371
He told me to tell you
that he has

26:33.466 --> 26:35.645
some housekeeping
to attend to.

26:36.721 --> 26:37.957
Housekeeping?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.871
That's what he said, sir.

26:43.722 --> 26:45.160
You know what I think?

26:45.477 --> 26:47.731
I think you know something
I don't know.

26:49.676 --> 26:50.942
He's in his office.

26:56.246 --> 26:57.408
Ten-hut.

26:57.863 --> 26:59.168
As you were.

27:00.490 --> 27:03.406
Wait your turn.
Carry on.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.613
Sorry, boss,
I wasn't expecting you.

27:07.637 --> 27:08.699
Clearly.

27:08.902 --> 27:10.908
Uh, if you could give us
a minute, Captains.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.738
No,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

27:12.887 --> 27:14.840
Well, I just don't want
to bother you with this.

27:16.074 --> 27:18.121
Isn't that what I do
for a living?

27:19.270 --> 27:21.754
We're just going over our recon
from the other night.

27:22.051 --> 27:23.262
And how's that going?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.822
It's going good, boss, good.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.398
Going good.
So you got the commanders

27:27.486 --> 27:30.231
of five different precincts here
for what, a retirement party?

27:30.319 --> 27:31.321
No, boss.

27:31.409 --> 27:33.074
Then don't tell me "good."

27:35.137 --> 27:37.613
It's just that
it all happened so fast.

27:39.161 --> 27:41.824
That's what the victim
always says.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.457
Are our cops victims in this?

27:47.545 --> 27:48.668
No, sir.

27:48.756 --> 27:50.019
Then what?

27:50.418 --> 27:51.635
May I speak freely, sir?

27:51.723 --> 27:52.768
You better.

27:53.035 --> 27:54.572
The guys are saying
next sweep

27:54.660 --> 27:57.043
they want hazmat suits
and golden overtime.

27:59.339 --> 28:01.129
These people don't want
to be moved, sir,

28:01.250 --> 28:03.973
and they make it real difficult
on our guys.

28:07.598 --> 28:10.270
15 minutes,
I want everyone

28:10.358 --> 28:12.257
where they should've been
in the first place,

28:12.345 --> 28:13.934
my conference room.

28:16.926 --> 28:18.127
Officers,

28:18.215 --> 28:20.723
ADA Reagan.
Can I have a word with Siriani?

28:23.551 --> 28:25.059
So, where'd you ditch
the gun?

28:25.147 --> 28:26.270
What gun?

28:26.358 --> 28:29.064
The gun you used on the other
hospital that you tried to rob.

28:29.152 --> 28:31.300
No, that wasn't my idea.
I didn't even know he had a gun.

28:31.387 --> 28:32.309
You're gonna
tell me that

28:32.397 --> 28:33.939
you didn't orchestrate
this whole thing?

28:34.026 --> 28:35.246
I didn't, I swear.

28:35.334 --> 28:36.416
Then why are we standing

28:36.504 --> 28:38.270
at another hospital
you worked for?

28:38.358 --> 28:40.238
Because he made me
bring him.

28:40.326 --> 28:41.442
Who?
Harris Hicks?

28:41.530 --> 28:43.488
He figured a way
to escape the facility,

28:43.610 --> 28:46.526
and he said he'd get me out, too,
if, if I helped him score.

28:46.614 --> 28:47.822
Then why isn't he here?

28:47.910 --> 28:49.707
Well, he saw the cops
and he took off.

28:49.997 --> 28:52.043
I-I shouldn't have said
anything.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.809
Wait, did you give him
another target?

28:53.897 --> 28:55.122
Shouldn't have said anything.
I shouldn't have...

28:55.209 --> 28:57.174
Mark, where is he going?
Other than the hospitals,

28:57.262 --> 28:58.386
I don't know
where to score drugs,

28:58.473 --> 29:00.814
but I knew where we could get
money for 'em.

29:00.902 --> 29:02.869
Mark, where did you send him?
I...

29:02.957 --> 29:05.817
She only ever tried
to help me.

29:05.926 --> 29:08.254
Who?
I'm sorry.

29:08.452 --> 29:10.280
I'm so sorry.

29:10.481 --> 29:12.761
- I'm so sorry.
- Guys!

29:17.371 --> 29:19.606
- Get a hold of her?
- No, she's not picking up.

29:20.184 --> 29:21.650
You got here fast.

29:21.738 --> 29:22.924
Well, I knew
if I didn't, uh,

29:23.012 --> 29:24.606
you'd be the first one
through the door.

29:28.939 --> 29:30.371
Wait here.

29:32.739 --> 29:34.027
Police!

29:36.229 --> 29:37.551
Put the gun down, Judge.

29:37.639 --> 29:38.721
Cheryl, you okay?

29:38.809 --> 29:41.127
- He just came at me, I just...
- Okay.

29:41.215 --> 29:44.402
All right, okay, okay.

29:44.548 --> 29:45.853
Give me your weapon.

29:47.365 --> 29:48.627
Officer.

29:50.684 --> 29:53.184
- Description matches Hicks.
- Who?

29:53.272 --> 29:55.518
Siriani's accomplice
from the clinic.

29:55.606 --> 29:56.965
He gave Hicks your address.

29:57.053 --> 29:58.752
No, but I-I was just
trying to help.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.590
- Why...
- I know, I know, I know.

30:03.254 --> 30:05.949
It's okay, it's okay.

30:09.819 --> 30:10.863
This way.

30:11.254 --> 30:13.127
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

30:13.215 --> 30:14.541
We need your help,
Katrina,

30:14.629 --> 30:16.324
so that nobody else
ends up like Wayne.

30:16.412 --> 30:18.005
I've already told you
everything I know.

30:18.093 --> 30:19.355
Like how you were
stealing drugs

30:19.459 --> 30:20.426
from your own ambulance?

30:20.514 --> 30:22.080
We saw
your doctored logs.

30:23.442 --> 30:26.488
That's why you told Higgins to
keep us out of the hospital, right?

30:26.785 --> 30:28.446
No, I just wanted privacy.

30:28.533 --> 30:31.098
I mean, to move on
from all this. Please.

30:31.186 --> 30:33.246
I know, Katrina.
I want to move on, too.

30:33.370 --> 30:34.713
But none of us
can move on

30:34.801 --> 30:36.933
until we know
who the hell did this.

30:42.386 --> 30:44.301
God,
he's got a wife and kids.

30:44.389 --> 30:45.434
Don't you think
they'd want to know

30:45.521 --> 30:46.732
more than anyone else
who did this?

30:46.819 --> 30:49.262
If they ever found out...
Found out what, Katrina?

30:50.185 --> 30:51.402
Hmm?

30:51.532 --> 30:53.910
Did Wayne have something to do
with these robberies?

30:57.731 --> 30:59.080
Yeah.

31:01.121 --> 31:03.270
Wayne got involved
with some bad people.

31:05.566 --> 31:08.621
Helped them
set up ambulances and...

31:09.542 --> 31:12.293
gave them the technical
expertise to rob them.

31:12.381 --> 31:13.879
In exchange for a profit?

31:14.215 --> 31:15.363
Yes.

31:15.451 --> 31:17.160
And you were innocent
in all of this?

31:17.248 --> 31:19.033
No, I tried to get him to stop,

31:19.121 --> 31:20.862
but he kept saying
just one more...

31:20.950 --> 31:22.449
Until somebody got killed.

31:22.746 --> 31:24.004
It was an accident.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.760
After that other EMT died,

31:25.848 --> 31:27.902
Wayne wanted out, but...

31:28.898 --> 31:30.152
he knew too much.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.329
It made him a loose end, and...

31:33.019 --> 31:35.606
- I... Oh, God...
- Now what?

31:35.694 --> 31:37.645
You're afraid that
you're a loose end, too?

31:37.746 --> 31:39.043
They saw me.

31:39.146 --> 31:41.097
They know
I was his partner.

31:41.185 --> 31:42.535
Nothing's gonna
happen to you.

31:42.623 --> 31:44.957
But you need to tell us
how these buses are getting hit.

31:46.739 --> 31:47.988
Now.

31:54.170 --> 31:56.607
Katrina said the call
would come in before rush hour.

31:56.743 --> 31:58.440
You got somewhere
you're supposed to be?

31:58.528 --> 31:59.865
Yeah, I was gonna
try to catch Eddie.

31:59.952 --> 32:01.224
- Talk to her for a sec.
- Mm.

32:01.312 --> 32:02.872
Trouble in paradise?

32:03.745 --> 32:05.573
- It's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

32:05.660 --> 32:06.818
Apologize.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.147
You don't even know
what happened.

32:08.234 --> 32:10.880
- Doesn't matter. Apologize.
- He's right.

32:10.968 --> 32:12.288
See?

32:12.585 --> 32:15.437
<i>There's a head
injury at 3100 Graham Avenue.</i>

32:15.525 --> 32:18.187
Female, approximately
75 years of age.

32:18.275 --> 32:19.601
So, Wayne...

32:20.765 --> 32:22.359
patched into the dispatch?

32:22.447 --> 32:24.859
Yeah, sent the fattest lambs
to the slaughter.

32:24.947 --> 32:27.327
And taught these thugs
how to use it, too.

32:28.599 --> 32:30.140
I, uh...

32:31.203 --> 32:33.734
I appreciate you getting
to the bottom of this.

32:34.109 --> 32:35.944
We appreciate your help,
too.

32:36.838 --> 32:38.274
<i>There is
an unconscious male,</i>

32:38.362 --> 32:39.773
<i>side of Bedford
housing projects,</i>

32:39.861 --> 32:42.827
<i>approximately 21 years of age,
lying on the pavement.</i>

32:42.915 --> 32:45.459
<i>Caller states male does not
appear to be breathing.</i>

32:45.547 --> 32:47.258
- Got it? It's go time.
- Yeah.

33:03.076 --> 33:04.295
Police!
Don't move!

33:06.650 --> 33:07.654
Oh.

33:10.769 --> 33:11.770
Hands up!

33:12.954 --> 33:14.725
Keep 'em up.
Keep 'em up.

33:17.092 --> 33:18.154
You set us up.

33:18.242 --> 33:19.662
Yeah. You know
what they call that?

33:19.750 --> 33:21.162
Taste of
your own medicine.

33:21.478 --> 33:22.756
You're damn right.

33:32.426 --> 33:34.863
And... one other thing

33:35.357 --> 33:36.373
before we...

33:36.461 --> 33:38.376
Kick the elephant
further down the road?

33:40.217 --> 33:41.592
If you are unhappy

33:41.680 --> 33:45.360
or uncomfortable with
any of your security detail,

33:45.448 --> 33:47.139
please come to me directly.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.459
In terms of?

33:48.599 --> 33:51.240
Any private activity
you enjoy

33:51.328 --> 33:53.740
that you might enjoy less
with cops around.

33:57.184 --> 33:59.412
It's been a while
since I got high.

33:59.512 --> 34:01.834
And if I were to partake,
it would be an edible.

34:01.974 --> 34:03.029
But thank you.

34:03.117 --> 34:04.920
Hey, just making the offer.

34:06.202 --> 34:08.639
What else did your
research on me turn up?

34:13.004 --> 34:15.779
That you believe
one of the keys to your success

34:15.867 --> 34:19.373
is understanding
how delivery systems need to work,

34:19.830 --> 34:21.130
and...

34:21.594 --> 34:24.764
you misread
our homeless problem that way.

34:26.589 --> 34:27.818
How so?

34:29.443 --> 34:31.670
Well, you were asking
my cops,

34:31.757 --> 34:33.661
who were trained
to uphold the law,

34:33.750 --> 34:37.521
to go around the law
and round up innocent civilians.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.732
49 degrees.

34:38.820 --> 34:41.780
Is a loophole you snapped
your fingers and got.

34:42.159 --> 34:43.681
One that worked.

34:44.882 --> 34:45.967
Only at a glance.

34:46.054 --> 34:48.451
Look, people got the homeless
off the street,

34:48.790 --> 34:50.333
but then the shelters
backed up,

34:50.422 --> 34:52.815
and they got the homeless
on otherstreets.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.803
We're working on that.

34:54.891 --> 34:57.201
Well, good. But until
there's a plan in place,

34:57.289 --> 34:59.232
the cart is
still before the horse.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.514
At least there's a cart
and a horse out there now.

35:02.314 --> 35:04.420
Look, Mr. Mayor,
people didn't vote

35:04.508 --> 35:08.032
to have vagrants on their block
shipped off to their neighbors.

35:08.685 --> 35:10.366
Maybe some
restaurateurs did,

35:10.453 --> 35:12.480
but we got
a whole lot more regular folk

35:12.568 --> 35:14.115
than we do restaurateurs.

35:14.273 --> 35:15.316
You about done?

35:15.404 --> 35:17.607
No. I'm not done.

35:18.350 --> 35:22.225
There is one more
important aspect to consider.

35:22.990 --> 35:25.754
We've trained a couple
of generations of cops now

35:25.842 --> 35:27.902
in the importance
of community policing.

35:27.990 --> 35:30.902
Mass roundups
without valid charges

35:30.990 --> 35:32.910
goes against that training.

35:33.256 --> 35:36.019
All this because one poor
homeless guy had a heart attack?

35:36.107 --> 35:37.105
Oh, come on, Mr. Mayor.

35:37.193 --> 35:38.826
What?
If you found rodent droppings

35:38.920 --> 35:40.411
in one of your markets,
would you think

35:40.498 --> 35:42.092
you only had one rodent?

35:43.912 --> 35:44.957
Then how come...?

35:45.045 --> 35:46.193
Well...

35:46.451 --> 35:49.074
Deputy Commissioner Moore
is very adept

35:49.162 --> 35:51.488
at moving incidents
and timelines around

35:51.576 --> 35:54.932
to make them look isolated
and disconnected.

35:55.568 --> 35:57.355
He likes 18-year-old Finnerty's,

35:57.443 --> 35:59.284
if you're in a thankful mood.

36:02.489 --> 36:03.723
How bad?

36:04.270 --> 36:06.019
Well, could've been worse.

36:06.255 --> 36:07.826
Let's avoid worse.

36:11.295 --> 36:14.482
I can't let these streets turn
into a flophouse after dark.

36:15.053 --> 36:16.355
Nobody wants that.

36:16.443 --> 36:17.738
I don't want that.

36:18.193 --> 36:20.225
Let us give you a plan.

36:21.396 --> 36:24.240
Why now?
You've been top cop for years.

36:24.420 --> 36:27.139
With bosses
who've always pushed back.

36:27.373 --> 36:29.793
You hear "no" enough,
eventually you save your breath.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.957
But...

36:31.045 --> 36:34.015
Mr. Mayor,
this feels different.

36:39.928 --> 36:41.004
And...

36:41.130 --> 36:42.975
I've taken up enough
of your time.

36:44.506 --> 36:47.379
Whatever plan you've got,
I need it yesterday.

36:47.514 --> 36:48.834
Okay.

36:51.295 --> 36:52.662
And, Frank...

36:52.779 --> 36:55.123
don't do a little jig
in the elevator.

36:55.771 --> 36:58.039
I know what a massage
feels like.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.021
Copy that, boss.

37:11.018 --> 37:12.377
Thanks for getting
the groceries.

37:12.465 --> 37:13.572
Yup.

37:15.744 --> 37:17.924
I shouldn't have said
that stuff about your dad.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.104
You mean calling him
a crook?

37:20.682 --> 37:22.237
I didn't say that
exactly.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.651
But that's
what you meant.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.166
And it's true.

37:25.254 --> 37:28.057
But I'm the only one
that's allowed to say that.

37:28.916 --> 37:30.237
Of course.

37:31.599 --> 37:33.036
I'm sorry.

37:34.647 --> 37:35.815
Good.

37:39.084 --> 37:41.216
And I do need
your help.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.649
You saying you're
gonna take the money?

37:44.237 --> 37:46.087
I guess I am.

37:46.943 --> 37:49.554
St. Jamie
taking dirty money.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.362
Potentially dirty.

37:51.450 --> 37:53.887
- Hmm.
- But the thing is,

37:54.069 --> 37:55.767
I already gave
half of it away.

37:55.872 --> 37:57.569
What?
To who?

37:57.657 --> 38:00.307
Found a family, the Parkers,
they lost a big chunk

38:00.395 --> 38:02.252
of their savings
when your dad...

38:02.340 --> 38:03.777
Stole it from them.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.257
Yeah.

38:05.854 --> 38:07.760
I haven't given it
to 'em yet, but...

38:07.848 --> 38:09.729
I thought
if we agreed...

38:09.822 --> 38:12.345
Their oldest
is starting college,

38:12.433 --> 38:14.908
and I thought we could make
a discreet scholarship.

38:15.267 --> 38:16.791
Claw the money
back ourselves.

38:16.925 --> 38:17.926
You got it.

38:18.846 --> 38:20.815
We use the other half?

38:21.073 --> 38:22.597
Call it a compromise?

38:22.731 --> 38:23.906
One condition.

38:23.994 --> 38:25.174
What's that?

38:25.768 --> 38:27.799
I'm working Saturdays,
too.

38:28.869 --> 38:30.033
Okay.

38:30.121 --> 38:31.166
Mm.

38:33.127 --> 38:35.205
Joint accounts? Really?

38:35.293 --> 38:36.468
Yeah, really.

38:36.556 --> 38:37.862
What's up with the "really"?

38:37.950 --> 38:39.119
I just never
got that.

38:39.207 --> 38:40.774
Especially if both spouses
are working.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.416
Linda and I never
had a joint account.

38:42.503 --> 38:44.339
Well, that just sounds like
a lot of extra paperwork.

38:44.426 --> 38:46.472
Yeah, and it saves
a lot of extra headaches

38:46.560 --> 38:48.389
when you have to constantly ask
the other spouse,

38:48.476 --> 38:50.487
"Do you mind if I splurge
on this, honey?"

38:50.644 --> 38:52.422
- To each his own.
- Right.

38:52.510 --> 38:54.588
Blink if you're
being manipulated.

38:54.830 --> 38:55.940
Hey.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.205
Hey, it was
a mutual decision, all right?

38:58.293 --> 38:59.861
Not sharing your bank account
with your wife?

38:59.948 --> 39:01.689
I never even considered that
an option.

39:01.762 --> 39:02.729
Me, either.

39:02.817 --> 39:04.104
Well, plenty of
people don't.

39:04.192 --> 39:07.375
Most divorce lawyers will tell you
that joint finances

39:07.463 --> 39:08.602
is better for
the marriage.

39:08.690 --> 39:09.750
Keeps everyone honest.

39:09.838 --> 39:11.208
Yeah,
but then you can't hide

39:11.296 --> 39:13.401
all your
extracurricular activities.

39:13.489 --> 39:15.441
You're a real Cupid these days,
aren't you?

39:15.529 --> 39:17.320
- Just being a realist.
- Venmo,

39:17.408 --> 39:18.781
PayPal, Apple Pay...

39:18.869 --> 39:20.274
Those are the new
checking accounts.

39:20.362 --> 39:21.509
Why would you want
to juggle a bunch

39:21.596 --> 39:23.291
of old bank statements
on top of that?

39:23.379 --> 39:25.737
- Because... cash.
- Yeah.

39:26.038 --> 39:28.025
On its way out. Sorry.

39:28.307 --> 39:30.719
Eventually someone
says that about everything.

39:30.807 --> 39:31.921
I don't buy it.

39:32.093 --> 39:33.313
People rarely

39:33.401 --> 39:34.697
carry cash anymore.

39:34.799 --> 39:36.221
- I do.
- Me, too.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.258
Me, three.

39:37.346 --> 39:38.268
I love cash.

39:38.356 --> 39:40.363
I love the numbers
in my savings account.

39:40.451 --> 39:42.940
Gee. Even I don't have
one of those anymore.

39:43.028 --> 39:44.642
Well, I do,
and I still have the statements

39:44.729 --> 39:45.869
from when I first opened it.

39:45.957 --> 39:49.134
What? It's like a timeline
of my life in bucks.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.330
You know, truth be told,
cash was an effective weapon

39:52.418 --> 39:53.463
when I was a cop.

39:53.551 --> 39:54.742
Amen to that.

39:54.830 --> 39:56.369
How was cash
a weapon?

39:56.457 --> 39:59.737
Well, not to leave this table,
but back in the day,

39:59.846 --> 40:01.697
if you needed some information
from someone,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.189
you could pull out
your shield,

40:03.277 --> 40:04.854
or you could pull out
your nightstick,

40:04.942 --> 40:08.033
or maybe even your weapon
on occasion,

40:08.143 --> 40:11.697
but most effective...
You pulled out your $20 bill.

40:12.736 --> 40:15.533
And you can take that
to the bank.

40:17.797 --> 40:18.984
Exactly.
