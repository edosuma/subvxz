01:46.023 --> 01:47.525
<i>Dear Dr. Jones,</i>

01:47.608 --> 01:51.612
<i>I act on behalf of a client
with access to very substantial funds</i>

01:51.695 --> 01:55.908
<i>who has indicated a desire
to sponsor a project to introduce salmon</i>

01:55.991 --> 01:59.453
<i>and the sport of salmon fishing
into the Yemen.</i>

01:59.662 --> 02:01.789
<i>I would like to seek a meeting with you
to identify</i>

02:01.872 --> 02:05.960
<i>how this challenging project
might be initiated and resourced.</i>

02:07.336 --> 02:09.630
<i>I might add that
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office</i>

02:09.713 --> 02:13.342
<i>supports the project as a symbol
of Anglo-Yemeni cooperation.</i>

02:14.844 --> 02:18.430
<i>Yours sincerely,
Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, Ms.</i>

02:18.514 --> 02:20.724
<i>Fitzharris & Price Investment Consultants.</i>

02:33.445 --> 02:34.697
Night. Have a good evening.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.783
You, too. Say hi to soldier boy.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.035
We're just friends, you know.
We've only met a couple of times.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.079
- Yeah, you tell me that on Monday.
- Shut up.

02:50.171 --> 02:52.464
- Hello.
- Hi. It's great to see you.

02:52.548 --> 02:55.009
- Yes. Me, too. Sorry.
- Yes?

02:55.092 --> 02:56.677
- Yes.
- You, too.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.096
- No, "Yes" is a start, that's fine.
- Stop it, I'm so nervous.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.306
Why are you nervous?

03:00.389 --> 03:03.058
I don't know. I'm trying to be
very sophisticated and grown-up.

03:03.142 --> 03:06.770
Right. No, grown-up, absolutely.
Quite right, yeah.

03:07.897 --> 03:09.398
- Harriet.
- Yes?

03:09.481 --> 03:10.983
Last one to the restaurant pays.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.151
What?

03:12.234 --> 03:14.195
You bastard.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.114
<i>Dear Harriet Chetwode-Talbot,</i>

03:18.699 --> 03:20.492
<i>thank you for your e-mail.</i>

03:21.076 --> 03:24.330
<i>As a fisheries specialist,
permit me a word or two about salmon.</i>

03:25.706 --> 03:31.170
<i>Migratory salmonoids require cool,
well-oxygenated water in which to spawn.</i>

03:32.296 --> 03:35.049
<i>In addition, in the early stages
of the salmon's life cycle,</i>

03:35.132 --> 03:39.511
<i>a good supply of fly life
indigenous to the northern European rivers</i>

03:39.595 --> 03:43.515
<i>is necessary for the juvenile salmon,
or parr, to survive.</i>

03:44.767 --> 03:47.061
<i>Some considerable distance
from the Indian Ocean,</i>

03:47.144 --> 03:49.813
<i>or indeed the Red Sea,
as I am sure you are aware,</i>

03:50.231 --> 03:53.651
<i>though apparently not
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</i>

03:54.526 --> 04:00.324
We conclude that conditions in the Yemen
make this project unfeasible.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.826
Fundamentally unfeasible.

04:03.160 --> 04:08.207
Yes, yes. Fundamentally unfeasible.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.334
We therefore regret

04:10.417 --> 04:14.171
that we are unable to help you
any further in this matter.

04:14.713 --> 04:18.884
Yours, Alfred Jones, Doctor.

04:18.968 --> 04:21.303
I've put duck liver pate in your sandwich.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.683
That's lovely.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.436
Righto. I'm off to bed.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.854
Already?

04:31.814 --> 04:34.525
- Airport car's coming at 5:00.
- Righto.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.612
I'll maybe have another wee pass
at the caddis fly paper.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.614
You could read it on the airplane.

04:40.698 --> 04:43.659
Up to my ear in reports, darling.
I'll read it when I'm back.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.537
Right, then. Good night.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.966
Oh, my God, I don't do this. I don't do this.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.884
No, I can tell.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.429
I haven't done this in a really long time.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.097
- Okay.
- I'm so shy.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.141
- Okay. No, I'll sleep on the sofa.
- No, I'm so shy.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.309
Look, Harriet, I mean it. I...

05:08.392 --> 05:09.810
Shut up.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.605
You were saying. You're shy.

05:14.064 --> 05:17.359
I am shy and quiet.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.153
Like Hitler. I'm serious.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.655
Robert, I...

05:21.739 --> 05:23.449
Don't do this and then forget me.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.618
I just don't wanna be
an army barracks joke in the morning.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.745
Please be nice to me.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.581
Harriet, I'm serious, too. I mean it.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.208
So if you want me
to sleep on the sofa, then I'll...

05:33.292 --> 05:36.670
If you say, Captain Mayers,
one more time you'll sleep on the sofa,

05:36.754 --> 05:38.630
you'll bloody well sleep on the sofa.

05:38.714 --> 05:42.009
Captain Robert Mayers, 3-6-4-7-7-2.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.057
Maxwell. Better be good.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.725
<i>Mrs. Maxwell, we have a situation.</i>

05:49.808 --> 05:51.727
<i>- What?
- Code Red in Afghanistan.</i>

05:51.810 --> 05:53.270
Go to sleep.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.648
Tell me that's not a mosque.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.650
<i>Well, it is a religious establishment...</i>

05:58.734 --> 06:00.611
<i>- Of course it's a bloody mosque!
- Well, of course...</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:02.321
- What's up?
- Go to sleep.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.907
<i>-...make this a joint operation.
- No,no,no,no,no,no,no.</i>

06:05.032 --> 06:07.618
The British have absolutely
nothing to do with this whatsoever.

06:07.701 --> 06:12.498
And I want every single man, woman, child
and goat in Afghanistan to know that.

06:12.623 --> 06:16.543
My God, I didn't think we could make
the war in Afghanistan any less popular,

06:16.627 --> 06:18.337
but, hey, even I can be wrong.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.632
We'll have Vera Lynn strapping on
her suicide belt in sympathy next.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.801
Bravo, the bloody Marines.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.140
Right, you lot.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.559
We need a good news story
from the Middle East, a big one.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.978
And we need it now.
You've got an hour, get on with it.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.241
<i>Good news, eh?</i>

06:48.117 --> 06:50.369
<i>New girl band, Middle East tour.</i>

06:50.828 --> 06:52.871
<i>Maybe. Maybe.</i>

06:52.955 --> 06:55.999
<i>Touch my body
No,</i> no...

06:56.875 --> 06:58.419
Okay-

06:59.253 --> 07:01.171
<i>Maybe not. No.</i>

07:02.506 --> 07:05.884
<i>British trans-Arabian rally.</i>

07:07.344 --> 07:09.179
<i>For God's sake.</i>

07:10.222 --> 07:13.851
<i>Come on, come on. Come up with something.
What's this?</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:18.564
<i>A project to introduce salmon fishing
to the Yemen.</i>

07:19.690 --> 07:22.651
<i>Salmon fishing.
Salmon fishing in the Yemen.</i>

07:22.734 --> 07:25.737
<i>Is that the best you puffed-up
Oxbridge-educated moronic buffoons</i>

07:25.821 --> 07:27.614
<i>can come up with?</i>

07:28.282 --> 07:30.325
Yes? Yes, Prime Minister.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.287
Well, no, I'm working on it right now.

07:33.370 --> 07:37.374
I think I may have come up
with something that you'll like.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.461
<i>Salmon fishing. Salmon fishing.</i>

07:40.544 --> 07:42.588
<i>Are you dollies trying to get me fired?</i>

07:43.630 --> 07:45.632
<i>Well, here we go.</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:47.885
<i>Fish it is</i>

07:57.811 --> 07:59.021
- Morning.
- Good morning.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.607
- Morning.
- Morning.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.233
- Morning.
- Hello.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.708
<i>Mrs. Maxwell on line one, sir.</i>

08:20.334 --> 08:21.627
Busy.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.378
<i>She says it's urgent, sir.</i>

08:24.421 --> 08:25.506
Maxwell who?

08:25.589 --> 08:27.799
<i>The press officer to the Prime Minister, sir.</i>

08:29.718 --> 08:30.761
Patricia.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.513
They haven't pensioned you off yet, then?

08:32.596 --> 08:34.556
Listen, I got the heads-up
from the FCO about this

08:34.640 --> 08:37.308
salmon fishing in the Yemen. Fancy it?

08:38.769 --> 08:40.145
- Well, I...
- We do.

08:40.229 --> 08:42.272
Chasing a good news story
out of the Middle East.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.358
Anglo-Yemeni relations back on track.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.902
Arab-Western cultural dÃ©tente
through the ancient sport

08:46.985 --> 08:49.905
of yanking poor sodding fish out of rivers.
What do you reckon?

08:50.322 --> 08:52.866
Well, it's a bit of a long shot, to be honest.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.201
<i>Well, don't be honest.</i>

08:54.493 --> 08:57.704
Lunatic's an oil sheikh.
Got money pouring out of his arse.

08:57.788 --> 08:58.956
Good friend of the West.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.458
Good friend of the Party, too,
so give it a go, eh, dolly?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.337
Well, we'll certainly
bend every sinew to the job, Patricia.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.755
I'll set up a working party immediately.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.382
- What?
- Hey!

09:08.465 --> 09:12.594
Don't you "working party" me,
you short-arsed little pen-pusher.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.639
I did not say kick it into the long grass.
I said do it!

09:15.806 --> 09:17.975
Yes, Patricia. Right...

09:18.433 --> 09:19.810
...away.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.313
Mr. Jones?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.651
Morning, Mr. Jones.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.237
Good morning, Betty.
I trust you had a nice weekend.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.574
Yes, thank you, Mr. Jones.
Mr. Sugden would like a word.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.785
Would he indeed? What do you think of that?

09:38.412 --> 09:40.080
It's for the caddis fly report.

09:40.706 --> 09:42.082
Need something racy for the cover.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.751
Something to rev up
the YouTube generation.

09:44.835 --> 09:48.630
I know it's not quite what we would
expect from a scientific paper,

09:48.714 --> 09:50.841
but we must keep up
with the times, Mrs. Burnside.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.552
Mr. Sugden asked to see you, Mr. Jones.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.262
I'm not too sure that I don't have a picture

09:55.345 --> 09:58.348
of a caddis being eaten alive
by a spider somewhere.

10:03.312 --> 10:04.688
There it is. That's a beauty.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.815
What do you think about that for...

10:07.149 --> 10:08.191
Good God.

10:10.569 --> 10:11.903
Little too much, do you think?

10:11.987 --> 10:13.947
No, not if you're making a horror film.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.783
Look, this e-mail about the salmon thing.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.494
Yes. Did I miss
April Fools' Day or something?

10:19.620 --> 10:23.123
Did you like my little swipe at the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office wonks?

10:23.206 --> 10:26.001
Yeah, well, I just had another e-mail
from the FCO today.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.794
Rattle their cage, did I?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.379
Look, you wouldn't take
a meeting with her, would you?

10:29.463 --> 10:30.714
This Chetwode-Talbot woman.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.300
She represents this
Sheikh Muhammed bloke.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.885
Why would I want to do that?

10:35.385 --> 10:38.388
Why would I want to traipse
across London to discuss that nonsense?

10:38.472 --> 10:40.807
I've very important work to do here,
as you can very well see.

10:41.058 --> 10:42.976
Yeah, well, the FCO, in their infinite W,

10:43.060 --> 10:46.021
feel that a meeting on this
is important business, too, Alfred.

10:47.064 --> 10:50.734
Lord, the tendrils of this
busybody government.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.237
Dr. Jones, as your Operational Line Manager,

10:54.321 --> 10:56.823
I am asking you with extreme prejudice

10:56.907 --> 10:59.910
to take a meeting
with Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.

11:01.453 --> 11:02.913
I take it that's an order?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.540
Take it how you wish.

11:07.876 --> 11:08.919
Nazi.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.464
Wanker. Morning.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.428
Dr. Jones?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.682
Miss Chetwode-Talbot is expecting me.

11:21.765 --> 11:24.893
Yes, it's a bit of a mouthful.
Do call me Harriet.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.855
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too. Do you want to come with me?

11:28.939 --> 11:30.315
Yes.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.737
Do come in.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.449
Please, sit down.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.662
Yeah, anywhere you like.
Would you like tea or coffee?

11:45.080 --> 11:46.456
No, thank you.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.833
So...

11:49.501 --> 11:53.463
Fitzharris & Price represent
the sheikh's assets in this country,

11:53.547 --> 11:56.550
including a number of estates in Scotland.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.052
He's a very keen fisherman,
so he asked us if we would...

11:59.136 --> 12:00.679
- Water.
- Sorry?

12:01.346 --> 12:03.348
Water, Miss Chetwode-Talbot. H2O.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.851
Do you want sparkling or still?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.811
Not for me, for the fish.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.191
Fish require water.
You are familiar with that concept?

12:14.192 --> 12:16.027
Yes. I am, yes.

12:16.111 --> 12:20.449
So, to save us both a lot of time,
let me keep this brief and simple.

12:20.532 --> 12:24.661
Here it's very cold. It rains a lot.

12:24.745 --> 12:28.832
Here it's very hot. It doesn't rain a lot.
Do you see the difference?

12:28.915 --> 12:31.918
Well, you're pointing to Saudi Arabia,
Dr. Jones, not the Yemen.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.795
You seem to be deliberately
missing the point.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.922
With respect, not really.

12:36.006 --> 12:38.550
You see, unlike Saudi Arabia,
parts of the Yemen

12:38.633 --> 12:41.595
get up to 250 millimeters of rainfall
a month in the wet season.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.388
It gets the edge of the monsoon, you see.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.514
And the dry season?

12:45.015 --> 12:46.725
Well, interestingly,

12:47.392 --> 12:50.270
recent oil explorations

12:50.353 --> 12:53.523
have uncovered a number
of very large freshwater aquifers,

12:53.607 --> 12:56.943
which could sort of recharge the wadi
in the dry season using a dam.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.028
I'm sure they could.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.906
So, when he's built his dam,
why don't you get back to me then?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.949
Completed, couple of years ago.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.288
Long-term plan is to irrigate
thousands of acres of desert.

13:08.747 --> 13:11.625
We could grow watermelons, maize, cotton.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.044
Now you're going to tell me it isn't
hot in the Yemen, too, aren't you?

13:15.212 --> 13:16.463
Well, in the mountainous areas,

13:16.546 --> 13:19.174
the nighttime temperatures
get down to well below 20 Celsius.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.676
And, of course,
I defer to your expert knowledge, Dr. Jones,

13:21.760 --> 13:26.139
but I do believe that Pacific salmon
get as far south as California.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.682
Temperatures are not too dissimilar there.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.145
- Water.
- For the fish.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.897
- No, for me.
- Of course.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.818
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

13:37.901 --> 13:38.944
Yes, Dr. Jones?

13:39.027 --> 13:41.071
This is plainly ridiculous.

13:41.363 --> 13:45.158
There's just no way that salmon can
survive in those sort of environments.

13:45.784 --> 13:48.119
If your sheikh wants to pour
his money down the drain,

13:48.203 --> 13:49.996
why doesn't he buy himself
a football club or something?

13:50.080 --> 13:51.748
Look, Dr. Jones.

13:51.832 --> 13:55.168
I don't really think it's my place
to explain the sheikh's motivations.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.170
But I will say this,

13:57.254 --> 14:01.174
that of all of our wealthy clients,
he is different.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.386
I would go so far as to describe him
as a visionary man.

14:05.095 --> 14:06.638
- A visionary?
- Yes, I know,

14:06.721 --> 14:08.640
it's not a very fashionable word,

14:09.224 --> 14:11.017
but if you decide to take this project with us,

14:11.101 --> 14:12.602
then you can judge for yourself
when you meet him.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.273
My line manager asked me to come here
and take this meeting to discuss your project

14:16.356 --> 14:18.692
and that I have done.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.278
I thank you for your time,
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.196
I'll see myself out. Goodbye.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.782
Thank you.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.500
<i>Did you get my e-mail?</i>

14:35.959 --> 14:37.586
Yes. What did it say?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.880
Took the meeting.
Waste of time, as predicted.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.506
Now, if you don't mind,
I'll get back to my work.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.216
Dr. Jones.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.306
What is this?

14:51.099 --> 14:52.225
P45.

14:53.310 --> 14:54.811
I'm sorry, I don't... I don't understand.

14:55.145 --> 14:59.024
Well, a P45 is the official document
given to an employee

14:59.107 --> 15:01.735
when his services are no longer
required by his, or her, employer.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.320
Yes, but, Bernard, this has got my...

15:03.403 --> 15:06.489
Or you can sign this letter

15:06.573 --> 15:09.576
stating that you are delighted
to assign yourself, exclusively,

15:09.659 --> 15:12.787
to the Yemeni salmon fishing project
with immediate effect.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.248
It's up to you.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.250
But, Bernard,

15:17.334 --> 15:20.045
you know as well as I do
this thing is a bloody joke.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.339
There's no way
you can get salmon that far up a...

15:22.505 --> 15:23.798
Just there.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.845
This is blackmail, Sugden.
This is a bloody outrage.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.223
Fitzharris & Price will be paying
your salary while on secondment.

15:32.307 --> 15:35.685
Almost double what it is now.
I'd say that's a bloody outrage.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.105
Double? Can I have time to think about this?

15:39.189 --> 15:40.607
Nope.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.193
- Can I borrow your pen?
- No.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.570
It's my special one with the italic nib.

15:46.947 --> 15:47.989
Hey.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.846
Hold it, hold it. Hold it.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.057
Brian, what...
What have you got in bar seven?

16:15.058 --> 16:16.935
I should have resigned.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.479
You can't afford to resign.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.815
Matter of principle.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.776
I have a standing
in the scientific community, Mary.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.319
A reputation.

16:27.529 --> 16:28.655
You have a mortgage.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.573
Two, three, four.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.260
Maybe I should resign.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.595
We could have a baby.

16:53.388 --> 16:57.726
Why not? You could stay on at work
and I could bring up the nipper.

16:57.809 --> 17:01.271
I could take him to the park and to school.
I could take him fishing.

17:02.313 --> 17:03.690
What do you think?

17:04.898 --> 17:07.193
They're really losing the plot in Geneva.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.653
One minute they're buying Euros,

17:08.737 --> 17:11.196
the next minute they can't
ditch them fast enough for dollars.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.450
They're panicking,
and guess who they want to bail them out.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.742
I can't imagine.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.037
<i>Say a command.</i>

17:17.119 --> 17:20.248
- Shut up.
- Say a command.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.795
What were you shouting about back there?

17:27.464 --> 17:29.382
Nothing.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.051
<i>Say a command.</i>

17:32.135 --> 17:33.970
<i>Mar)'-</i>

17:37.057 --> 17:39.059
Oh, Lord.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.188
Well, that should do you for a while.

17:46.608 --> 17:47.859
Thank you, Mary.

17:54.449 --> 17:55.992
Good night.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.494
Night, dear.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.886
Oh, Jesus.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.681
Good morning.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.434
Yes, Staff.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.150
I've gotta go.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.027
Now?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.363
Yeah. That was the call.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.991
Sorry.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.620
Is it Afghanistan?

18:43.206 --> 18:46.167
It's somewhere sandy, that's for sure.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.255
- I'll go get some tea.
- No, look...

18:50.380 --> 18:52.882
- No, it's all right, Robert. It's...
- No, no, come here.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.428
Look, the last few weeks...

18:59.055 --> 19:00.807
This is good.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.392
Wonderful.

19:03.101 --> 19:07.188
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't know how long I'm gonna be.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.276
Will you wait for me?

19:22.287 --> 19:23.496
Now go get that tea.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.249
You bastard.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.135
<i>Well, firstly,
we would need to trap 10,000 salmon</i>

19:37.218 --> 19:39.012
from the North Sea, for the sake of argument,

19:39.095 --> 19:41.598
get them to the Yemen alive,
don't ask me how,

19:41.681 --> 19:43.266
where they would be deposited

19:43.349 --> 19:48.313
in temperature and oxygen-controlled
holding tanks built into a wadi

19:48.396 --> 19:51.441
that would, hallelujah,
open during the rainy season,

19:51.524 --> 19:55.778
allowing the salmon to migrate upstream
for, say, 10 kilometers,

19:55.862 --> 19:57.447
which would allow your sheikh

19:58.031 --> 20:02.327
to hoick them out of the water
to his heart's content.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.829
Of course, until the dry season,

20:04.913 --> 20:06.456
when they will all

20:07.707 --> 20:08.750
die.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.462
Well, unless we feed the wadi
all year round using the dam.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.798
Of course. Stupid idiot man.

20:15.882 --> 20:20.345
Why not use precious water resources
to support one man's sport fishing?

20:21.262 --> 20:25.058
So, now that we have year-round water,

20:25.141 --> 20:28.519
why not build some
gravel spawning grounds,

20:28.603 --> 20:30.605
breed the world's first Arabian salmon,

20:30.688 --> 20:32.899
and teach the clever fellows
to migrate to the Indian Ocean...

20:32.982 --> 20:34.484
Wonderful, wonderful idea.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.403
...singing, "Step we gaily, here we go.
Heel for heel and toe for toe."

20:37.487 --> 20:38.488
Rough cost?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.114
Cost?

20:40.823 --> 20:41.908
Cost.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.703
Forty million. No, 45...

20:45.787 --> 20:47.372
- Fifty million.
- Dollars?

20:47.455 --> 20:48.873
- Dollars.
- Dollars.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.708
Or pounds.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.252
Pounds.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.004
At least.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.177
So it's theoretically possible?

21:02.887 --> 21:04.889
Well, it's theoretically possible
in the same way

21:04.973 --> 21:07.976
as a manned mission to Mars
is theoretically possible.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.354
It's very impressive, Dr. Jones.

21:11.938 --> 21:15.525
No, it's not. It's nonsense.
Look, I just made it all up.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.859
No, the drawing.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.861
Real talent, if I might say so.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.573
Excellent start.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.326
So I suppose we should just
crack on and get things started now?

21:25.410 --> 21:28.913
You can't hold me to this.
I mean, these are just random ideas.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.873
I mean, this is a sort of joke.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.752
Well, I'm sure you wouldn't joke about
a 50-million-pound project, Dr. Jones.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.170
Not when you're in charge of it.

21:37.547 --> 21:40.091
Well, the sheikh is
so looking forward to meeting you,

21:40.174 --> 21:41.884
and he'll be back in the next couple of weeks.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.471
So, in the meantime, is there
anything else that I can do for you?

21:45.555 --> 21:47.765
Well, as a matter of fact, there is.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.267
Could you arrange a meeting

21:49.350 --> 21:52.145
with the hydro-engineering team
from the Three Gorges Dam?

21:52.770 --> 21:53.855
The one in China?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.189
Is there another?

21:55.857 --> 21:58.151
British Oxygen Company.
A meeting with them as well.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.820
And then, what are those
great big transport aircraft called?

22:00.903 --> 22:02.655
The big Russian military...

22:02.739 --> 22:03.906
Antonovs.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.950
Find out about renting two of those,

22:06.034 --> 22:09.245
one for the fish and one to carry
all the money that we're going to need.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.205
When that's done,
I'd be delighted to start working.

22:11.414 --> 22:12.832
Good day, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.834
Good day, Dr. Jones.

22:33.770 --> 22:34.854
Mary!

22:34.937 --> 22:36.356
Up here.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.484
Boy, did I put a hurricane
up that Chetwode-Talbot woman.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.735
You would have laughed.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.238
I told her I wanted a meeting with
the Three Gorges Dam team from...

22:45.948 --> 22:47.033
Where are you going?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.618
Geneva. I told you.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.204
You didn't say now.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.706
Well, I am. Tomorrow.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.333
Well, how long are you going for?

22:55.416 --> 22:57.085
Six weeks, to start with.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.836
Six weeks?

22:59.379 --> 23:00.838
There's no need to shout.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.259
Six weeks, though, Mary.

23:05.343 --> 23:09.514
This is a big chance for me.
I'll be heading up the whole operation.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.309
Well, you could say "Congratulations."

23:17.855 --> 23:19.232
Great.

23:32.620 --> 23:35.957
Enough is enough. It's job or marriage.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.835
You've got to make a decision
and make it now, God damn it.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.344
There are planes, you know, Fred.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.515
And I get Sundays off. Mostly.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.562
You can get all your
horrible old fishing stuff out again.

23:57.645 --> 24:00.815
Didn't even ask me. Just went and did it.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.401
I know. I'm sorry.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.988
It just suddenly seemed
like the right decision.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.200
Maybe for both of us.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.957
Fred, I don't want to leave on bad terms.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.212
No. No.

24:26.007 --> 24:28.634
I'll open a bottle of something fizzy. Okay?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.140
<i>Reports are coming in from Afghanistan</i>

24:34.223 --> 24:37.643
<i>of a British soldier killed
while on duty in Helmand Province.</i>

24:37.727 --> 24:40.229
<i>An improvised explosive device detonated</i>

24:40.313 --> 24:43.316
<i>during a routine search
in a local village. This...</i>

24:56.370 --> 24:59.499
<i>The Minister for Culture 's
been photographed doing what?</i>

25:00.416 --> 25:01.626
Naked or clothed?

25:02.251 --> 25:03.336
Boy or girl?

25:04.128 --> 25:05.213
How old?

25:05.296 --> 25:08.549
Jesus. Well, at least she's legal.

25:08.633 --> 25:13.095
Press statement from us saying that
we're a party of policy not personality,

25:13.179 --> 25:15.014
concentrating on the real issues of

25:15.097 --> 25:18.309
getting this country back on track
in times of economic hardship

25:18.392 --> 25:22.855
and not tabloid sensationalism,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

25:22.939 --> 25:26.275
Meanwhile, get the useless arse
on the front page of every paper

25:26.359 --> 25:27.902
apologizing for being born,

25:27.985 --> 25:31.280
big spread in <i>Hello!</i> with
blonde forgiving wife and cute kids.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.116
If they're not cute, find a horse or something.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.118
Joshua! Hood.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.289
Don't you suck your teeth at me, young man.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.333
I'm not one of your bitches
from the Baltimore low-rises.

25:42.416 --> 25:43.793
You feel me? I'm your fucking mother!

25:50.466 --> 25:52.510
Got to go. Meeting.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.400
<i>Dear Dr. Jones,</i>

26:07.483 --> 26:10.361
<i>the sheikh has requested your company
at his estate in Glen Tulloch</i>

26:10.444 --> 26:12.613
<i>to discuss the salmon project further.</i>

26:12.697 --> 26:14.991
<i>Please advise which dates
would suit you best.</i>

26:15.074 --> 26:18.536
<i>Many thanks, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot,
Fitzharris & Price.</i>

26:23.416 --> 26:26.669
<i>Mr. Sugden would like
to see you in the canteen, sir.</i>

26:27.461 --> 26:29.797
Up his arse with a meter ruler.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.091
Thanks, Betty.

26:33.551 --> 26:34.844
- Which one is he?
- Over here.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.470
Fred.

26:36.554 --> 26:38.764
Can I introduce Patricia Maxwell?

26:38.848 --> 26:41.809
She is the Prime Minister's press officer.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.436
Hello.

26:47.231 --> 26:51.611
Fifty million from
Sheikh Muhammed thingammy.

26:52.445 --> 26:55.072
It's the first-stage payment
on research development

26:55.156 --> 26:56.741
for the salmon fishing project.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.534
The PM's keeping a close eye on this one.

26:58.618 --> 26:59.785
It's just what we need right now,

26:59.869 --> 27:03.998
a bit of Anglo-Arab news
that isn't about things that explode.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.333
I want to know, is it a goer?

27:06.042 --> 27:09.253
Goer? Well, look, the complexities.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.172
I mean, I barely know even where to begin,

27:11.255 --> 27:15.509
but, well, just for starters,
we would need 10,000 live salmon.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.762
Is 10,000 salmon a lot?

27:17.845 --> 27:19.388
Well, if they're to come from British waters,

27:19.472 --> 27:20.931
and I don't see where else
they're gonna come from.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.392
I mean, you would need the permission
of the Environment Agency.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.645
That's your job, Bernard.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.441
Okay, so you get on to the EA
and get this man his salmon.

27:30.524 --> 27:33.027
- Miss Maxwell. Ms.
- Mrs. Happily married.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.278
<i>Details in Who's Who.</i>

27:34.362 --> 27:36.989
Mrs. Maxwell, there are
two million fishermen in the UK

27:37.073 --> 27:39.158
who are, I would say,
unusually protective of...

27:39.241 --> 27:40.451
How many?

27:40.534 --> 27:42.745
- Two million.
- Two million?

27:43.371 --> 27:45.748
- Yes.
- Bloody hell.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.919
Two million out there
waving their little rods around?

27:51.754 --> 27:53.297
Are they the kind that vote our way?

27:53.381 --> 27:55.925
They vote for those that best
look after their fish, in my experience.

27:56.092 --> 27:57.593
I bet they do, I bet they do.

27:58.761 --> 28:02.431
Right, so, Prime Minister on the front cover
of <i>Fishy Weekly</i> or whatever.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.100
Best friend of the British fisherfolk.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.686
Spearing a leaping salmon. I like this.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.604
I like it a lo'[.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.315
They do have magazines, these people?
They can read?

28:11.607 --> 28:13.943
<i>Aye, the Angling Times, Trout and Salmon,</i>

28:14.026 --> 28:16.195
<i>Coarse Fishing Monthly, Bassmania.</i>

28:16.278 --> 28:17.405
<i>Bassmania?</i>

28:18.614 --> 28:20.032
Marvelous.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.868
Marvelous. That's marvelous.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.748
This has just become a priority project.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.875
Anything I can do, just give me a call.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.336
Two million.

28:33.796 --> 28:36.132
God, men, what a species.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.634
I don't think she got
the right end of the stick there.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.094
Your call, I think, Bernard.

28:40.177 --> 28:44.140
Ten thousand native Atlantic salmon
on my desk by Friday, please.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.853
Yeah, well, you'd just better
come through on this, Jones.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.460
It's been a long time since I was back.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.503
- Yes?
- A long time.

29:24.472 --> 29:25.473
You see?

29:25.556 --> 29:27.183
- Is that where he lives?
- Yes.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.936
He has many estates,
but this one's his favorite.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.887
- May I present Malcolm, the butler.
- Hello.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.223
- This is Dr. Jones.
- Welcome to Glen Tulloch, sir.

30:10.518 --> 30:13.521
His Excellency thought you might
like to avail yourself of the fishing

30:13.604 --> 30:14.772
while you're waiting.

30:18.776 --> 30:19.944
Thank you very much.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.410
May I present
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama.

31:09.493 --> 31:10.578
This is Dr. Jones.

31:10.661 --> 31:12.705
It's a great pleasure to meet you,
Your Excellency.

31:12.872 --> 31:15.916
To meet the creator of the Woolly Jones,
the pleasure's all mine, sir.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.085
That's very kind.

31:18.168 --> 31:21.130
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, do you realize
that for more than 10 years

31:21.213 --> 31:22.464
I have fished with a Woolly Jones?

31:22.548 --> 31:24.717
Really? What's a Woolly Jones?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.677
Dr. Jones invented a famous fly.

31:27.469 --> 31:31.098
Well, it's a sentimental habit
that some fly-tiers have

31:31.181 --> 31:32.474
of calling a fly after...

31:32.558 --> 31:35.311
Anyway, I don't approve
of that sort of thing normally, but...

31:35.394 --> 31:38.022
Woolly Jones. It's a great name.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.982
A bloody good fly, that's for sure.

31:40.774 --> 31:44.236
Please allow me to show you
a delightful lie just around the corner.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.614
Absolutely. Lead on.

31:49.033 --> 31:50.951
You think I'm mad?

31:51.035 --> 31:53.120
- No, Your Excellency. I...
- Of course you do.

31:53.203 --> 31:55.539
I would question yourjudgment
if you did not.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.375
Though I have judgment enough to know

31:58.459 --> 32:01.962
that under there lies a fish
much cleverer than I.

32:04.590 --> 32:08.344
I'm a great admirer of the British
for many reasons,

32:08.427 --> 32:11.305
but still there are mysteries to me.

32:11.388 --> 32:15.601
The rich are frightened of the poor.
The poor are frightened of the rich.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.437
And even your politicians,

32:18.520 --> 32:20.814
<i>they try to sound like
the people on the EastEnders.</i>

32:22.274 --> 32:24.151
A wonderful program, but still.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.570
Yes, the great British class system.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.614
Indeed.

32:29.531 --> 32:32.618
But fishermen, I have noticed,

32:32.701 --> 32:35.621
they don't care whether
I'm brown or white, rich or poor,

32:35.704 --> 32:37.706
wearing robes or waders.

32:38.082 --> 32:42.211
All they care about is the fish,
the river and the game we play.

32:44.421 --> 32:51.136
For fishermen, the only virtues are patience,
tolerance and humility.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.182
I like this.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.068
You are struck dumb
by my naivety, Dr. Alfred.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.653
No, you're on.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.738
- What?
- You're on.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.034
- This is a sign.
- A sign?

33:15.160 --> 33:17.871
A sign that I should
stop talking bollocks and fish.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.833
Come here.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.674
- Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.

33:28.757 --> 33:29.800
Very nicely done.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.404
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

33:50.487 --> 33:51.864
Hello, Dr. Jones.

33:54.074 --> 33:55.075
Is that yours?

33:56.243 --> 33:57.619
- The dress.
- Yes.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.914
This is not mine.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.043
It suits you very well.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.461
Thank you.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.713
They seem to know my size.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.424
That not strike you as a wee bit sinister?

34:10.966 --> 34:13.385
The idea of the sheikh's tailor
tracking me across London

34:13.469 --> 34:15.304
with some kind of
satellite measuring device?

34:17.723 --> 34:20.225
They asked me for your size.

34:20.309 --> 34:23.145
And I took a guess.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.359
Well, for future reference,

34:29.693 --> 34:31.945
I have a 32-inch waist, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

34:32.029 --> 34:33.655
- Right.
- Not a 34.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.324
No pies for me.

34:36.617 --> 34:37.993
Note taken, sorry about that.

34:39.620 --> 34:40.788
Thank you.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.960
Ms. Harriet has told me
of your marvelous plan.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.799
Plan? Well, not so much of a plan, really,

34:51.882 --> 34:53.926
as more of a feasibility study.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.136
Theoretically possible, you said, Dr. Jones.

34:57.054 --> 34:59.515
- Theoretically.
Jndeed.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.644
It would be a miracle of God
if it were to happen.

35:03.852 --> 35:05.604
I'm more of a facts-and-figures man myself.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.272
You're not a religious man?

35:07.564 --> 35:09.358
No. No, I'm not.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.653
But you're a fisherman, Dr. Jones.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.030
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

35:17.324 --> 35:22.955
How many hours do you fish
before you catch something? Dozens?

35:23.247 --> 35:24.498
Gosh, hundreds sometimes.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.502
Is that a good use of your time
for a facts-and-figures man?

35:30.379 --> 35:34.633
But you persist in the wind
and the rain and the cold

35:34.716 --> 35:37.302
with such poor odds of success.

35:37.719 --> 35:38.971
Why?

35:39.429 --> 35:42.099
Because you're a man of faith, Dr. Alfred.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.812
And in the end,

35:46.895 --> 35:49.064
you are rewarded for your faith
and constancy

35:49.857 --> 35:51.400
With a fish.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.569
With due respect,

35:53.652 --> 35:56.446
fishing and religion are hardly
the same thing, Your Excellency.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.365
With equal respect,

35:58.448 --> 36:00.075
I have to disagree.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.413
A toast?

36:08.917 --> 36:10.043
To faith.

36:11.086 --> 36:12.337
And fish.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.089
To faith and fish.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.258
To faith and fish.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.594
And science.

36:19.595 --> 36:20.929
And science.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.814
You're unhappy tonight, Ms. Harriet?

36:30.898 --> 36:33.108
No. I'm fine, really.

36:33.525 --> 36:37.154
I have too many wives not to know
when a woman is unhappy.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.323
Though mine are not so quiet about it.

36:45.454 --> 36:51.293
Robert, he's my boyfriend,
has just been posted to Afghanistan.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.378
Or somewhere.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.299
I'm sorry.

36:57.466 --> 36:59.176
No, it's fine.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.260
For how long?

37:01.637 --> 37:04.014
They don't really tell us things like that.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.641
How worrying.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.268
I just try not to think about it.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.814
- And you are married, Dr. Alfred?
Jndeed.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.150
It is kind of her to spare you.

37:15.734 --> 37:20.072
My wife's actually working abroad
at the moment in Geneva, so...

37:20.822 --> 37:24.159
So you two have more in common
than one might suppose.

37:28.372 --> 37:32.501
I have put my feet in it. Please forgive me.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.336
Perfect moment to retire to bed.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.923
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.258
Thank you for a lovely evening.

37:39.341 --> 37:40.759
You're welcome.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.762
- Dr. Alfred.
- Your Excellency.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.431
I know you have been persuaded to help us,

37:46.515 --> 37:48.183
but unless you do this with an open heart,

37:48.267 --> 37:51.144
I don't think anything will come of it.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.021
So, please, consider.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.481
Of course.

37:54.564 --> 37:56.858
I hope we meet again.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.156
Dr. Jones.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.283
Yes?

38:04.366 --> 38:07.828
Well, I was just wondering what you thought.

38:07.911 --> 38:09.705
Well, the sheikh's English

38:09.788 --> 38:12.416
has a certain tendency
towards the mystical, don't you think?

38:13.083 --> 38:17.379
But then, doolally as
this entire enterprise clearly is,

38:17.462 --> 38:20.882
I've had the most pleasant day I can
remember having for quite a long time.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.885
So, if the sheikh is paying, as it were,
on we go.

38:24.469 --> 38:25.470
Great.

38:25.887 --> 38:26.972
Good night, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.140
Good night, Dr. Jones.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.725
It's been a pleasure.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.601
Yes.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.002
<i>Have you any idea
what an outcry there would be</i>

38:57.085 --> 39:01.214
<i>if the Environment Agency
stripped British rivers of 10,000 salmon</i>

39:01.298 --> 39:03.508
<i>and shipped them off to the effing Yemen?</i>

39:03.592 --> 39:04.676
Well, how many can you spare?

39:04.760 --> 39:05.886
<i>None!</i>

39:05.969 --> 39:08.638
<i>Christ, Bernard!</i>

39:08.722 --> 39:11.516
<i>Anglers, they're obsessive crazies.</i>

39:12.267 --> 39:14.436
<i>You think AI Qaeda are a threat,
think again, mate.</i>

39:15.103 --> 39:17.189
<i>I've seen a fly fisherman wade into a river</i>

39:17.272 --> 39:21.276
<i>and try and drown a canoeist
just for passing by in a Day-Glo jacket.</i>

39:21.902 --> 39:25.405
<i>You haven't got a hope in hell
of getting these fish from British rivers.</i>

39:28.075 --> 39:30.160
- Yes?
- Dr. Jones. Hello.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.079
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot. How nice.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.955
- Did we book a meeting?
- No.

39:34.623 --> 39:37.042
You know how you said
that you wanted a meeting

39:37.125 --> 39:39.628
with the hydro-engineering team
from the Three Gorges Dam?

39:40.087 --> 39:41.671
- Did I say that?
- Yes.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.423
That might have been a little hasty.

39:43.507 --> 39:44.841
- They're outside.
- Who?

39:45.092 --> 39:47.719
The chief hydro-engineering team
from the Three Gorges Dam.

39:47.803 --> 39:48.804
Here?

39:48.929 --> 39:51.223
I e-mailed them about the flow rate calculus,

39:51.306 --> 39:53.225
and I think there must have
been some kind of...

39:53.308 --> 39:55.477
My Mandarin is very rusty.

39:58.980 --> 39:59.981
Bloody hell.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.777
We are able to control the flow of water
from the upstream dam.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.156
But we are...

40:08.240 --> 40:11.993
Well, we're concerned about
the capability of the sandstone walls.

40:14.788 --> 40:18.291
I mean, there's the possibility
also of some flash-flood scenario.

40:21.795 --> 40:23.171
Thank you very much.

40:26.383 --> 40:27.926
My God, do you think we got away with it?

40:28.009 --> 40:31.221
- Do you know, I think we did.
- I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.141
No, please don't apologize.
I think we've just found our engineers.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.392
- Yes.
- I mean,

40:35.475 --> 40:38.019
should the project, of course, get that far.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.022
Your Mandarin was much better
than I expected.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.400
- Thank you.
- Bernard Sugden, Head of Department.

40:43.483 --> 40:44.484
Hello.

40:44.568 --> 40:45.944
Alfred not bothering you too much, I hope?

40:46.278 --> 40:47.320
No.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.281
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot from Fitzharris & Price.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.532
Hello.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.367
Bet he doesn't even know
your first name, does he?

40:53.118 --> 40:55.370
So, who were all those
little chippy-chappies?

40:55.454 --> 40:57.706
Those are the engineers
from the Three Gorges Dam.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.124
What, the one in China?

40:59.207 --> 41:01.501
- Is there another?
- Don't think there's another one.

41:02.836 --> 41:04.546
Would have appreciated an introduction.

41:04.754 --> 41:09.259
Bernard is the man who's responsible for
acquiring our 10,000 native Atlantic salmon.

41:09.342 --> 41:10.677
How's that coming along, Bernard?

41:10.760 --> 41:14.222
Don't you worry about that, Fred.
It's all in hand.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.975
Well, don't dilly-dally.
Our end is coming along.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.186
- We're bang on schedule, in fact.
- Yes.

41:19.269 --> 41:22.189
A debrief in the canteen, or has Fred
brought in the famous sandwiches?

41:22.272 --> 41:24.941
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot and I
are going out for lunch, Bernard.

41:25.025 --> 41:26.568
There's lots to discuss.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.987
Clare, could you ask Betty to bring my bag?
Thank you.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.572
Certainly, Dr. Jones.

41:35.660 --> 41:38.288
Are you sure you won't have one?

41:38.371 --> 41:39.372
At lunch time?

41:39.998 --> 41:43.168
Dr. Jones, I haven't spoken
a word of Mandarin for about four years,

41:43.251 --> 41:45.337
so I am celebrating even if you're not.

41:45.420 --> 41:48.757
I only drink alcohol on the weekend.
And even then, only after 7:00.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.467
No exceptions?

41:50.926 --> 41:52.344
None that I can think of.

41:53.762 --> 41:56.097
Well, yeah. We got married on a Friday,

41:56.890 --> 41:59.809
but I think it was, as I recall,
a bank holiday in Northern Ireland,

41:59.893 --> 42:02.729
so I allowed myself, I think,
a glass on a technicality.

42:05.899 --> 42:08.109
That was an attempt at a joke,
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

42:08.777 --> 42:10.946
Right. Good one.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.283
Do you really think it's going extremely well?

42:15.867 --> 42:17.827
- What?
- The project.

42:17.911 --> 42:19.329
The project.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.207
Well, it's utter nonsense, of course,

42:22.290 --> 42:25.919
naturally, the bagatelle of a man
with more money than sense, but...

42:26.378 --> 42:29.714
I haven't actually found anything
to say that it couldn't work.

42:29.798 --> 42:31.550
You know, theoretically, of course.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.052
In theory.
Well, theoretically speaking, in theory it...

42:34.135 --> 42:35.345
- We'll see, yes.
- Of course.

42:36.638 --> 42:39.849
Actually, these are the companies
that have bid for the contract

42:39.933 --> 42:41.893
to build the holding tanks
at the downstream end of the wadi.

42:41.977 --> 42:43.728
- Shall we go through these?
- Now?

42:43.812 --> 42:45.438
Yes, we could go through them now.

42:45.522 --> 42:47.148
Well, we could work and eat, no?

42:47.399 --> 42:49.317
Yes, I... Yes, all right, then.

42:49.401 --> 42:50.694
- This one's from...
- Before that, cheers.

42:51.987 --> 42:54.364
- Cheers.
- Very bad luck with water.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.033
Some people think it's bad luck.

43:00.537 --> 43:02.539
- EWB...
- Sorry. Excuse me.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.166
It's the barracks. It's Robert.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.459
- Sorry.
- No. Go on.

43:06.543 --> 43:07.627
- Hello.
- Go ahead.

43:07.711 --> 43:08.920
Hello?

43:11.172 --> 43:12.591
Yes?

43:17.470 --> 43:18.555
What?

43:22.517 --> 43:23.685
What?

43:41.036 --> 43:43.246
Are you all right, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?

43:45.582 --> 43:47.542
He's missing in action.

43:50.003 --> 43:51.421
What does that mean?

43:54.132 --> 43:56.676
- Come upstairs and we'll get you your...
- No, I just need a minute.

43:59.095 --> 44:02.015
Hello. My name's Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.

44:02.098 --> 44:07.270
Well, I only knew him for three weeks,
but I am Robert's girlfriend.

44:07.395 --> 44:09.939
I was wondering if you knew anything...

44:11.566 --> 44:12.859
Of course. Yes.

44:12.942 --> 44:15.028
Sorry, Mrs. Mayers. Yes, I...

44:16.237 --> 44:18.990
Yes, of course. Goodbye.

44:23.119 --> 44:27.207
<i>You've reached Harriet Chetwode-Talbot.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

44:27.290 --> 44:30.168
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot, it's Dr. Jones here.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.921
Please forgive me for calling you
on your home number.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.340
I was at something of a loss.

44:35.423 --> 44:39.010
I realize that this has not been
an easy week for you,

44:39.094 --> 44:42.347
but I was wondering when you might be
coming back into the office.

44:42.430 --> 44:43.848
I had a very productive meeting

44:43.932 --> 44:46.601
with the engineers
from British Oxygen Company

44:46.685 --> 44:48.978
and, well, there's a lot of data coming in.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.106
Really a considerable amount.

44:52.190 --> 44:56.361
I'm sure I don't have to remind you
that we are working to a deadline.

44:56.444 --> 45:00.490
Time and tide, as I am sure you are aware,
waits for no man.

45:01.533 --> 45:02.784
Or woman.

45:04.536 --> 45:09.499
Anyway, I look fon/vard to hearing from you
at your earliest convenience. Goodbye.

45:45.118 --> 45:46.327
Can I come in?

45:47.746 --> 45:48.747
Why?

45:49.789 --> 45:51.499
Well, you might get cold.

45:59.799 --> 46:01.259
- Very nice.
- What?

46:02.343 --> 46:04.429
Your flat. Very pleasant.

46:15.774 --> 46:18.067
Look, I'm not...
I'm not coming into work, all right,

46:18.151 --> 46:19.319
because I need to stay here.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.530
I need to be here in case there's news.

46:23.239 --> 46:26.868
So, actually,
anyone with a shred of understanding,

46:28.286 --> 46:31.831
or humanity, or simple feeling,

46:31.915 --> 46:35.919
who, frankly, wasn't suffering
from some kind of Asperger's,

46:36.002 --> 46:38.171
would know that the last thing that I need

46:38.254 --> 46:42.133
is your bullying little phone call

46:42.217 --> 46:45.929
asking me to come into work
so that you can update me on fish.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.974
You want to fill me in on fishing.

46:50.058 --> 46:52.477
Well, Dr. Jones, you can take your work

46:52.560 --> 46:55.772
and you can shove it up your unfeeling arse.

46:58.233 --> 47:00.485
I didn't come here to talk to you about work.

47:00.568 --> 47:01.736
Then why are you here?

47:02.821 --> 47:04.697
I made you a sandwich.

47:06.407 --> 47:07.408
Why?

47:07.492 --> 47:10.078
You're probably not eating. Are you?

47:16.376 --> 47:19.420
No. You see, it's very important.

47:21.214 --> 47:23.550
You must eat something.

47:28.012 --> 47:29.514
Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

47:29.889 --> 47:31.224
Here.

47:33.893 --> 47:35.770
I don't know what to do.

47:37.021 --> 47:38.982
I don't know what to do because...

47:40.024 --> 47:41.734
I'm so sorry, Dr. Jones.

47:41.818 --> 47:44.779
Call me Fred. Just call me Fred.

47:45.864 --> 47:46.906
- You're all right now?
- Yeah.

47:47.740 --> 47:48.825
You all right?

47:48.908 --> 47:50.368
- Sorry.
- No,donT

47:51.661 --> 47:54.497
Why don't I get a plate and we...
You can put this on a plate.

47:54.581 --> 47:57.458
- Shall I do it?
- No, it's okay. I'll do it.

48:13.308 --> 48:18.897
I'm so sorry about what I said before.
That is just unforgivable.

48:18.980 --> 48:21.274
The great thing about people with Asperger's

48:21.357 --> 48:23.359
is it's very difficult to hurt their feelings.

48:23.443 --> 48:25.153
So it's all right,
you can say whatever you like.

48:27.322 --> 48:29.991
You don't have... You know, I was upset.

48:30.617 --> 48:32.243
And rightly so.

48:32.327 --> 48:37.081
Look, I took the liberty of
buying a wee bottle of wine.

48:37.165 --> 48:38.207
Now, I hope you don't mind.

48:38.291 --> 48:42.462
I know it's not the weekend,
but this one goes very well with duck.

48:43.421 --> 48:44.881
I'm not very hungry.

48:45.214 --> 48:47.008
Harriet, you've got to try and eat...

48:47.091 --> 48:49.552
Is it all right...
Is it all right for me to call you Harriet?

48:59.604 --> 49:02.273
My father is...

49:02.523 --> 49:04.108
He's ex-Army,

49:04.192 --> 49:08.488
so he's like very stiff upper lip
and don't make a fuss about anything,

49:08.571 --> 49:10.907
but I'm more of a gusher.

49:11.407 --> 49:13.576
I think that's his word for me, anyway.

49:14.744 --> 49:17.246
My upper lip's never been very stiff,
I'm afraid.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.458
But you still have a boyfriend.

49:20.541 --> 49:23.711
I mean, I don't know a great deal
about such things, but...

49:24.420 --> 49:26.506
Robert hasn't been listed
as being dead, has he?

49:26.589 --> 49:30.760
No. But I just feel that
"missing in action" is Army-speak for...

49:30.843 --> 49:33.680
Dead? No. No, as a civil servant,
I happen to know that

49:33.763 --> 49:37.809
the Ministry of Defense absolutely hate
uncertainty of any kind.

49:37.892 --> 49:40.520
If he were dead,
they would simply say "dead."

49:40.687 --> 49:41.980
Can you stop using that word, please?

49:42.063 --> 49:44.148
- I beg your pardon.
- It's okay.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.571
They say that they'll call when there's news.

49:51.864 --> 49:54.242
But they don't, so I guess there isn't.

49:58.913 --> 49:59.914
Come to the Yemen.

50:00.248 --> 50:02.333
We're leaving tomorrow, just for a few days.

50:02.417 --> 50:04.877
- Geological studies, engineering surveys.
- No.

50:04.961 --> 50:06.421
We even have a team of archeologists

50:06.546 --> 50:08.881
checking we're not about to submerge
the Ark of the Covenant,

50:08.965 --> 50:10.925
which would be unfortunate, you know.

50:12.135 --> 50:15.638
No, I can't leave
because there might be news and...

50:15.722 --> 50:18.349
Well, then, you'll fly back on
the sheikh's private jet immediately.

50:20.268 --> 50:21.686
Why would he do that?

50:21.769 --> 50:23.646
Because I asked him to.

50:25.106 --> 50:29.360
Your services are very highly valued
by the sheikh,

50:29.444 --> 50:31.112
and by me.

50:34.240 --> 50:36.617
The project really can't do without you.

50:38.161 --> 50:40.663
Who the hell cares?

50:40.788 --> 50:43.916
Project? I mean, it's fishing.
You know, who the hell cares?

50:44.917 --> 50:49.047
Well, strangely enough, I do.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.758
I mean, I know it's probably
just a terrible folly,

50:51.841 --> 50:56.387
but, still, I can't help
sometimes imagining that this

50:56.471 --> 50:59.223
crazy enterprise might just come off.

50:59.307 --> 51:01.976
You know, with a bit of luck
and with the right people.

51:04.103 --> 51:06.898
And you, you are most definitely,
most definitely

51:06.981 --> 51:08.649
one of the most rightest people

51:08.733 --> 51:10.568
that I've had the good fortune
to come across.

51:11.402 --> 51:15.448
If you'll forgive the grammatical
inadequacies of that sentence.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.985
Do you sometimes think
that maybe we're just

51:53.069 --> 51:55.780
part of a lavish practical joke?

51:55.863 --> 51:57.907
What do you mean? Salmon, here?

51:59.117 --> 52:01.327
Yes, I'm beginning to suppose that.

52:30.439 --> 52:32.275
I don't know anyone
that goes to church anymore.

52:33.442 --> 52:35.653
I don't think I do, either.

52:35.736 --> 52:38.489
On a Sunday, we go to Target.

52:53.921 --> 52:58.926
You know, this gravel here is perfect
for salmon to lay their eggs in between.

52:59.010 --> 53:00.636
Who'd have thought that here
in the middle of the Yemen,

53:00.720 --> 53:02.763
perfect spawning grounds for salmon?

53:11.230 --> 53:12.773
Fred, look.

53:12.857 --> 53:13.941
What?

53:16.152 --> 53:17.653
Yes.

53:22.283 --> 53:24.160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

53:29.165 --> 53:30.374
Harriet, the water.

53:31.292 --> 53:33.419
- It's beautiful.
- It's cold.

53:34.629 --> 53:36.839
The water in her well is cold.

53:55.149 --> 53:56.609
Oh, my goodness.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.946
It's really happening, Fred.

54:00.029 --> 54:02.740
Oh, my goodness, it really is.

54:56.377 --> 54:57.503
Unbelievable.

54:59.380 --> 55:04.218
These men, they say that by bringing water,
life, to this desert,

55:04.302 --> 55:07.305
I am bringing the Western ways to our land.

55:07.388 --> 55:09.307
They say I have insulted God himself.

55:10.391 --> 55:12.184
I say they are fools.

55:13.811 --> 55:15.604
A thousand apologies, my friends.

55:15.688 --> 55:20.818
Please, this is not a way
to introduce you to our great enterprise.

55:23.279 --> 55:24.488
Look.

55:26.282 --> 55:28.784
Is it not magnificent?

55:29.452 --> 55:30.494
It's beautiful.

55:30.578 --> 55:31.746
Certainly is.

55:33.372 --> 55:35.082
Bloody amazing.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.044
- Hello.
- Hello.

56:08.491 --> 56:09.825
<i>For the last time, Sugden,</i>

56:09.909 --> 56:13.162
<i>there is absolutely no way
I can get you these fish.</i>

56:14.580 --> 56:17.416
Tom, this comes from the top. The very top.

56:17.500 --> 56:20.378
<i>I don't care if God's taken up fly fishing.</i>

56:20.461 --> 56:23.547
Now, I suggest you make this work, Tom.

56:23.631 --> 56:25.132
<i>Is that a threat, Sugden?</i>

56:25.466 --> 56:29.011
These are difficult days, Tom.
Cuts. Cuts everywhere.

56:29.929 --> 56:34.016
I don't know. ls the Environment Agency
a frontline service?

56:36.394 --> 56:38.396
<i>That is a threat.</i>

56:38.479 --> 56:40.189
See it as an opportunity.

56:46.153 --> 56:49.281
Well, then. An opportunity.

56:51.117 --> 56:55.037
<i>Hilary, get me Matthew Sweet
from Fly Fishing Monthly, will you?</i>

57:20.729 --> 57:23.441
That's all I've been told, and so I...

57:23.524 --> 57:25.901
Okay. All right, then.

57:25.985 --> 57:29.405
Well, please, please, please call me when...

57:31.282 --> 57:32.992
Okay. Bye.

57:33.492 --> 57:35.536
I'm so sorry. Did I wake you up?

57:35.619 --> 57:37.913
No. No, no. News?

57:37.997 --> 57:42.877
No. No, I was just
leaving a message on Robert's phone

57:44.879 --> 57:48.674
which is ridiculous
because he hasn't got his phone with him.

57:50.551 --> 57:52.470
And I know that.

57:52.553 --> 57:53.888
Just turning into a madwoman.

57:54.096 --> 57:55.139
No.

57:55.723 --> 58:00.436
No, when things get tricky in my life,
I talk to my fish.

58:02.563 --> 58:04.064
I have a pond.

58:05.232 --> 58:10.237
Talking to an answering machine
is no madder than chatting to koi carp.

58:11.447 --> 58:14.200
I just somehow wouldn't associate you
with having a tricky life.

58:17.161 --> 58:19.246
Well, it wouldn't do to talk about
your emotions with a colleague,

58:19.330 --> 58:20.789
would it, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot?

58:27.087 --> 58:28.589
No, I think...

58:29.757 --> 58:33.010
I think things are beyond tricky, really.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.971
They have been for some time.

58:36.055 --> 58:38.224
Mary's in Geneva. I'm here.

58:38.307 --> 58:40.267
The koi carp are alone in Surrey.

58:43.771 --> 58:46.065
We got married very young.

58:46.148 --> 58:47.900
I'm sorry, I didn't...

58:47.983 --> 58:50.194
I didn't really know things were hard.

58:50.277 --> 58:53.489
No, don't apologize. There's always hope.

58:54.782 --> 58:56.825
For me and for you.

59:03.082 --> 59:06.460
Do you know,
I can't even remember what he looks like.

59:07.294 --> 59:08.379
Not exactly.

59:10.631 --> 59:13.259
But I'm stuck,

59:14.134 --> 59:15.886
and I can't move on.

59:15.970 --> 59:17.263
Does that make any sense?

59:19.181 --> 59:21.016
Yes. Totally.

59:22.851 --> 59:26.021
I feel a bit like I've been stuck for years.

59:26.105 --> 59:28.107
Yes, but you can move on.

59:29.567 --> 59:31.485
Well, I suppose in theory.

59:34.613 --> 59:36.657
You should be happy, Fred.

59:45.499 --> 59:47.501
I knew you'd have a pond.

01:00:14.987 --> 01:00:19.575
The traitor has had his chance.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.703
You know what to do.

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:26.040
Do not fail us.

01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:43.599
<i>I think the idea of taking
Scottish salmon to a foreign country</i>

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:44.892
<i>is absolutely absurd.</i>

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:48.979
These fish have been running these
rivers for tens of thousands of years.

01:00:49.063 --> 01:00:51.106
I've fished the rivers of Scotland all my life.

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.608
Yes, Prime Minister.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:56.070
It would appear that the gentle fisherfolk
are not so effing gentle after all.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.280
<i>...rape and pillage of our national rivers...</i>

01:00:58.364 --> 01:00:59.740
What, ditch the whole thing?

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.326
No. No, no, no, Prime Minister.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:06.246
No, we mustjust find the fish
somewhere bloody else.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.682
Your turrets are blocking my reception.

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:27.935
Well, I'm terribly sorry about that, madam.
If you'd care to follow me, please.

01:01:31.105 --> 01:01:32.606
Mrs. Maxwell.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:34.775
- Pleasure to meet you.
- It's an honor.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.028
Happy birthday, Patricia.

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:41.073
Yes, we could do with
a few more like you in Cabinet.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:42.282
Very good, Your Excellency.

01:01:43.409 --> 01:01:47.162
I'm grateful, indeed, that you could
spare some time for our little project.

01:01:47.287 --> 01:01:50.290
Yes. Well, we have gone out on
a bit of a limb for you, Your Excellency,

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:52.084
but the Prime Minister does love his fishing.

01:01:52.167 --> 01:01:54.712
- Really?
- Yes. Rod's never out of his hand.

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:57.548
Anyway, down to business.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:01.343
The fish. The salmon.
We're not gonna get it out of British waters.

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.805
There's a bloody big fuss about it,
as no doubt you've heard.

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.224
Don't know what it is about fishing.
Anyway, no-goer.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:11.645
- Yes, but I thought...
- However,

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:15.399
I have solved your problem.

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.570
See? There must be thousands
in this one alone.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:22.656
This guy's got four fish farms
up and down the coast.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.409
Stocks all the Tescos.
Right under your nose.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:28.412
These fish were bred for the dinner table.
It's barbaric.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:29.913
They've never run in their lives.

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:31.749
Neither have their forebears
for two generations.

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:32.833
Why would they run for us?

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.793
...the difference in these salmon...

01:02:34.877 --> 01:02:35.919
We'd open the sluices

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:38.422
and they would just drift off downstream
never to be seen again.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:42.718
Well, get a couple of days fishing out of it,
then just re-stock or whatever the word is.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.052
Seems to be no shortage of them.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:47.514
...In transit for the supermarkets.

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:50.601
These fish will never run.
They're just not right.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:52.478
Not right?
Well, a fish is a fish is a fish, isn't it?

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:56.899
No. You see, Mrs. Maxwell, I have a vision.

01:02:57.733 --> 01:03:00.235
Tired, bloated pretenders
are not part of this vision.

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:03.989
Well, unfortunately,
Her Majesty's Government also has a vision,

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:06.658
and that vision is farmed fish or no fish.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:08.577
Then I must thank you
for your precious time.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:09.870
And decline.

01:03:12.873 --> 01:03:16.251
No advisers, either.
Back at your desk on Monday, Fred.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:19.505
Well, in that case, I resign.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:20.798
Resignation accepted.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:22.716
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.639
So, this leaves us with what?

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.390
Well, with no salmon.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:34.812
We must have faith, Dr. Alfred.

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:37.064
Well, that's a very laudable sentiment,
Your Excellency,

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:39.983
but we're running out of time.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:42.277
Can't catch faith with a fishing rod.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.846
Hello, Fred.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.900
Sheikh Muhammed bin Zaidi bani Tihama!

01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:31.451
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:34.121
I didn't think he looked right, that man.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.373
And he pulled out a gun! Are you all right?

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.499
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:38.584
Yes.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.048
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Alfred.
Thank you very much.

01:04:45.132 --> 01:04:48.802
Don't be silly. Don't be silly.
It was only a cast, really.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.680
A very good cast.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.726
An essential cast, one might say.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:59.187
Yes, I suppose one might say that.

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.565
- Here.
- My God, Fred. Are you all right?

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:03.984
Yeah, yeah. It was very quick.
It was over in a flash, really.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.235
How did you do that?

01:05:05.319 --> 01:05:07.487
I did a right-handed snake roll. Did I get him?

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:10.073
Yes, it was extraordinary.

01:05:12.159 --> 01:05:13.827
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you very much.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:18.373
Please, continue your work
as if nothing had happened.

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:19.750
Of course, of course.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:20.959
I owe you my life.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.544
No. Please, come on. Anyone would have...

01:05:22.628 --> 01:05:25.881
This is not one of those
British metaphors, Dr. Alfred.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:27.299
The debt will be repaid.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:30.260
- Bye, now.
- Goodbye.

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:31.678
Bye.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:42.773
<i>In response to the Right
Honorable Member's question</i>

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.983
<i>of the 7th of last month,</i>

01:05:45.067 --> 01:05:47.653
<i>the Ministry of Defense can now confirm</i>

01:05:47.736 --> 01:05:50.447
<i>that an engagement by British Special Forces</i>

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.326
<i>against known terrorists
did occur on the 13th of September.</i>

01:05:55.243 --> 01:05:57.621
<i>The details of this operation are classified.</i>

01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:01.041
<i>However, I am at liberty to say</i>

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:04.294
<i>that serious casualties
were incurred by the British forces.</i>

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:09.716
<i>I deeply regret to inform the House
that there were no survivors.</i>

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:14.304
<i>An internal investigation is being carried out.</i>

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.194
Sorry to wake you up.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.864
- No, don't be.
- It's just...

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:15.532
It's okay.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:17.284
It's just...

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:20.412
I just never got the chance
to really know him.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.853
Mary?

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:29.356
Fred? There you are.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:30.689
I had no idea you were...

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.276
I got a day off and thought,
"Why not surprise him?"

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.196
I've got this wonderful
Swiss mountain ComtÃ©

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.282
from a little shop round the corner
in Geneva.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.202
Is everything all right, Fred?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:44.955
Where's your suit and tie? Day off?

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:47.207
I resigned.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:49.709
Don't be ridiculous.

01:08:50.252 --> 01:08:51.962
You've resigned?

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:54.673
What about your pension? It's final salary.

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.801
Well, the government pulled out
of the salmon fishing project

01:08:57.884 --> 01:09:00.011
and we'd put a lot of time and energy into it.

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:02.721
I didn't want to walk away from that.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.307
Well?

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:08.228
Well, everyone involved.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.982
I'm still being paid,
if that's what you're worried about.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.859
Fitzharris & Price have been more than...

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:16.903
I might have known she'd be involved.

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:19.781
If you're referring to Harriet,
we're working on the project together.

01:09:19.865 --> 01:09:20.948
Of course she's involved.

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:23.702
- Harriet?
- What do you mean exactly by that, Mary?

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:27.080
I've seen her photograph
on the Fitzharris & Price website.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.249
You're making a fool of yourself.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.584
Now it's you that's being ridiculous.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:32.335
Am I'.?

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:35.589
I'm not the one abandoning a decent,
highly respected job

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:39.301
for a joke fishing project
and a short-skirted office girl.

01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:42.053
- She's not an office girl.
- What is she, then, Fred? Hey?

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:43.388
Just what is she?

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.930
She's a colleague.

01:09:45.015 --> 01:09:47.350
- She's a very talented colleague and...
- And?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.604
And a friend! She's just a friend!

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.458
Are you in love with her?

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:17.380
I've done nothing, Mary.
I have no expectations.

01:10:17.464 --> 01:10:20.050
I didn't ask about your expectations.

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:23.595
I asked if you were in love with her.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:32.103
This is a mid-life crisis.
It's textbook, it's pathetic.

01:10:32.187 --> 01:10:33.230
I'm so sorry, Mary.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.817
You'll be back, Fred. Or you'll try.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:42.781
Six months and you'll be
begging to be taken back in.

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.951
It's in your DNA.

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.996
You'd think a bloody scientist
would know that much!

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:27.284
<i>Six months and you'll be
begging to be taken back in.</i>

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:30.787
<i>It's in your DNA.</i>

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.010
<i>We don't need native river fish.</i>

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:47.304
We'll be all right with farmed salmon.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.932
I know. I don't much like them, but...

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:52.684
Well, they will run. I know it.

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.313
Yes, Your Excellency.

01:11:57.272 --> 01:12:00.650
Despite our moral
and philosophical objections,

01:12:00.734 --> 01:12:02.652
farmed salmon will run.

01:12:02.736 --> 01:12:04.362
I'm absolutely sure of it.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.073
You are tireless, Doctor.

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:10.243
You have uncovered some new research?

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.579
A new paper, perhaps?

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.247
No, I just know it.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:19.669
You just know it. I see.

01:12:26.176 --> 01:12:27.844
Faith, Dr. Alfred.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:34.392
Damn it. Yes, all right, then, faith.

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:12.347
So?

01:13:14.516 --> 01:13:15.517
They're alive.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.384
<i>That hurts!</i>

01:13:51.553 --> 01:13:53.304
Sorry, sweetie.

01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:54.514
<i>- Mrs. Maxwell?</i>
- What?

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.100
<i>Amazing news.
One of the officers presumed dead,</i>

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:59.436
<i>Captain Robert Mayers, has been found alive.</i>

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.439
<i>- Good.
- Yes, we're very pleased.</i>

01:14:02.522 --> 01:14:03.648
Yes, very good.

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:05.358
<i>It's very good news for the family.</i>

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:07.694
<i>And his girlfriend, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.</i>

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:12.157
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who else knows about this?

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.450
<i>You're the first to know.</i>

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:15.243
Right, keep it that way.

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.078
Total press embargo. Do you understand?

01:14:17.162 --> 01:14:19.914
<i>- Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
- That salmon fishing thing.</i>

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:21.374
Is that still happening?

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:22.959
<i>As far as I'm aware.</i>

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.627
- It is?
- Yes.

01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.129
- Yemen?
- Yes.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.006
Perfect.

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:32.260
Yes, this is all coming together very nicely.

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:29.400
I intended to create a small miracle.

01:15:29.484 --> 01:15:33.780
Something to glorify God
and bring our tribes together.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:39.285
Sometimes I wonder if we haven't
created something that glorifies man.

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:41.788
It is a very fine line.

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.291
Hubris, Dr. Alfred.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.461
Hubris.

01:16:06.938 --> 01:16:09.023
- It's nice here.
- Beautiful.

01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:24.205
You know, Fred, this project,
it saved me. I think.

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:27.250
You know, with everything that happened.

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:32.005
So those farmed fish had better run.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:33.923
- I believe they will.
- You do?

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:38.011
Yes, I believe that it's in the very core
of their being to head upstream

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:42.056
even if they never have,
even if the parent fish never have.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.604
Look at this.

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.691
Look at that.

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:57.488
Mary said something about me.

01:16:59.866 --> 01:17:05.038
She said that I was genetically programmed
to return to a dull pedestrian life with her.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:07.790
That it was in my DNA.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:11.628
Do you think that you are?

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:17.717
No. No, I belong here. I always have done.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.064
- Harriet.
- Yes.

01:17:36.444 --> 01:17:40.239
I was wondering about you and me.

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.995
The theoretical possibility in the same way

01:17:46.079 --> 01:17:49.666
as a manned mission to Mars
is a theoretical possibility.

01:17:49.749 --> 01:17:51.125
Obviously.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:56.381
Or salmon fishing in the Yemen.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.683
Yes.

01:18:08.142 --> 01:18:09.852
- Yes?
- Yes.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:14.816
I just need a little time.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:18.194
Of course, of course. All the time you want.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.823
Thank you.

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:25.368
Thank you.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:40.591
- Mr. Foreign Secretary.
- Brian Fleet.

01:18:40.675 --> 01:18:41.676
The great fisherman.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:44.804
The great...
Well, it has been a little while, to be honest.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.472
A bit rusty, you know.

01:18:46.556 --> 01:18:49.142
Some skills are never forgotten.

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:53.271
Please, follow this man to your tent.
I shall join you shortly.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.231
What have you been saying?

01:18:55.314 --> 01:18:57.942
Fishing's the last thing anyone's
gonna be interested in, trust me.

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:01.404
Get ready for the photo op of a lifetime,
Sonny Jim.

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.115
N-S-R. No salmon required.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.999
Is that a Woolly Jones?

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.709
No, this is a new one I've invented.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:16.419
IS it?

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:17.628
What's it called?

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.302
This one is called
the Chetwode-Talbot Beauty.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:25.928
That's very nice.

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.597
It's true.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.182
You're not being funny?

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:31.434
No, I don't have a sense of humor,
as you recall.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.770
That is true.

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:43.196
- Beautiful.
- Yes, she is.

01:19:58.544 --> 01:19:59.754
Here.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:01.547
Thank you.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:07.762
Don't you think we should be
doing something, Fred? Preparing?

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:09.096
<i>L</i> am preparing-

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.307
Well, for the whole thing, you know.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:14.644
Everything's done, Harriet, it's fine.
Just relax.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:16.729
Did you just...

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:19.440
Dr. Alfred Jones just told me to relax.

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:23.820
What is the world coming to?

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:37.416
Oh, my God.

01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:46.300
Harriet.

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:29.468
Right, Harriet and Robert...

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:43.900
Right, okay. Shut up, hacks.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:45.985
No military stuff. It's classified.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:47.236
Anyway, I don't think you'd understand it.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.073
The only thing you need to know
is that this man, Captain Mayers here,

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:52.617
is a war hero.

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:55.036
Human interest stuff only. Sir.

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:58.122
Harriet, can you tell us how it feels?

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:01.918
It feels like it's a...

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:05.254
It's a... It's a shock, but it's wonderful.

01:22:05.338 --> 01:22:06.881
Please can we have a kiss?

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:10.343
Go on. Come on.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.393
I am sorry, my friend.

01:22:19.477 --> 01:22:22.188
No- No, it's- - -

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:24.565
It's a miracle.

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:25.942
Indeed.

01:22:27.652 --> 01:22:30.780
Nevertheless, I'm sorry.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:33.366
All right, gentlemen, gentlemen,
I think that's all.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.785
A little privacy for the couple, please.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.954
I'd just like to say
that the British government

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:40.414
is proud to have played
a small but significant part

01:22:40.498 --> 01:22:45.044
in this extraordinary reunion
of Harriet and Captain Mayers.

01:22:46.379 --> 01:22:48.172
That's what we're here for.

01:23:12.154 --> 01:23:14.156
This is strange.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.492
Bad strange?

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:18.244
No, good strange.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:28.921
Do you mind if we don't...

01:23:29.797 --> 01:23:31.507
No, of course not.

01:23:33.801 --> 01:23:35.428
There's no rush.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.435
Will you just hold me?

01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:57.491
How did you get caught up in this, H?

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:02.038
Salmon fishing out here? It's ridiculous.

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:07.293
Well, you never know with the sheikh.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:13.883
I expect there will be a six-star hotel
and a golf course before you know it.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.802
That's not his style at all.

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.474
Don't you believe it.

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:26.353
He's gotta make his money back somehow.

01:24:27.354 --> 01:24:29.648
They're no fools, these Arabs.

01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:39.135
You don't sleep, either?

01:25:40.386 --> 01:25:41.846
No, not much.

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:44.098
Well...

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:50.646
At least there's no bloody journos
around at this time, anyway.

01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:57.486
You've been very good to Harriet, Fred.

01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:59.363
I appreciate it.

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:01.615
I love her.

01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:04.410
Yeah, she's great.

01:26:05.119 --> 01:26:07.121
She's really great.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:08.789
No.

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:11.750
I love her.

01:26:25.806 --> 01:26:27.474
Does she love you?

01:26:29.059 --> 01:26:30.686
I don't know now.

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:34.690
Yesterday, you weren't alive.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.109
Well, I apologize for
not being dead in a ditch.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.114
I don't think I can accept your apology.

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.036
Is that a joke?

01:26:50.456 --> 01:26:54.835
Yes, yes, sort of. I'm not...
I've never been very good at jokes.

01:27:00.132 --> 01:27:02.426
It's all right, Robert. Really.

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.346
It's all right.

01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:17.149
The day has arrived.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:20.277
Before the dam, this was a dry riverbed.

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:23.781
And now, as you all can see, we have water.

01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:28.786
And today, we hope we shall discover
the one missing thing.

01:27:29.078 --> 01:27:31.330
So, thank you, one and all, for coming

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:34.959
as not one of you, not even my dear self,

01:27:35.042 --> 01:27:38.754
knows if this curious experiment of mine
will actually work.

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:41.090
It better had bloody work.

01:27:41.173 --> 01:27:43.384
Doesn't matter if it works or not, dolly.

01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.094
All that matters is you.

01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:47.429
Fishing on Sky tonight with our war hero.

01:27:47.513 --> 01:27:49.932
- I haven't done this in years.
- For God's sake.

01:27:50.015 --> 01:27:51.433
There are 10,000 fish in there.

01:27:51.517 --> 01:27:55.604
If you can't hook one of them,
you can just flip off back to Transport.

01:27:55.688 --> 01:27:59.525
My intention is to color this desert in green.

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.320
Make an agricultural industry for my people,

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:06.782
and the sons and daughters of my people
for generations to come.

01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:09.159
- Right on cue.
- So here we are,

01:28:09.243 --> 01:28:12.454
Muslims, Christians and the odd heathen.

01:28:12.538 --> 01:28:16.959
We are all gathered here in an act of faith.
And why not?

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:22.589
And now, the moment
that we are all waiting for,

01:28:22.673 --> 01:28:25.551
the fruits of all our efforts.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.137
The moment of truth.

01:28:29.847 --> 01:28:31.056
Open the sluices.

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:47.489
Where's it going?

01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:50.075
It's going the wrong way.
It's heading downstream.

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.715
Wait a minute.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:15.267
It's turned around. Wait. Wait, wait.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:17.686
- Look, they're going upstream.
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:22.941
Oh, my God, they're running. Fred, look.

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.198
Look!

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:31.325
- They're running, Fred!
- They're running!

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:38.624
Blondie. Come down here, come on.
Come down here now.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:40.709
Look, we ought to get a picture of him
with the sheikh.

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:45.255
- It's working, Your Excellency.
- It is.

01:29:45.339 --> 01:29:47.841
They are running upstream, look!

01:29:47.925 --> 01:29:50.511
Let's go fishing, Dr. Alfred.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:15.244
Turn it on, dolly.

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:16.578
I need to get further out.

01:30:16.662 --> 01:30:19.706
For God's sakes. Come on, off you go!

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:21.792
Have you got that?

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.920
Yes, Mrs. Maxwell.
But can we get them closer together?

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:27.297
God, I'll give it a go. Robert, darling.

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:30.134
Can you come... Can you turn around a bit?

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.012
I'm worried about
what he's doing with his rod.

01:30:52.531 --> 01:30:54.116
Lovely. And, Brian,

01:30:54.575 --> 01:30:56.618
just a nice smile, that would be good.

01:30:56.702 --> 01:30:58.328
Did you get that?

01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:02.666
God, he's useless, isn't he?

01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:12.301
More fun without waders, Dr. Alfred.

01:31:12.384 --> 01:31:13.469
Yes.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:32.988
I think I caught one, Dr. Alfred.

01:31:33.071 --> 01:31:34.406
It's a beauty, Your Excellency.

01:31:38.744 --> 01:31:40.454
Look out behind you!

01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:42.247
Your Excellency, behind you!

01:32:08.398 --> 01:32:09.525
Step UP-

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:11.652
No, you first!

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:15.781
I repay my debts, Dr. Alfred.

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:18.450
- Okay. I'll pull you up. After...
- Okay.

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:30.254
Here, Your Excellency, hold on.
Here, come on.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:05.807
We won't need these anymore.

01:34:34.753 --> 01:34:37.506
I just don't understand who would do this.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:38.965
Why would they do this?

01:34:40.759 --> 01:34:43.470
I know who. And I know why.

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:47.182
Can't you find them? Arrest them?

01:34:47.265 --> 01:34:48.558
What for?

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:51.520
Jusfice.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.358
Jusfice.

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:04.199
I think these destroyers... Bad men, certainly.

01:35:05.951 --> 01:35:07.911
But I think perhaps they have a point.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.334
I expected people to understand
what we were doing here.

01:35:14.793 --> 01:35:19.423
I expected them to see
that it was really not about fishing at all.

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:27.514
In the end, I asked for too much.

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:32.853
Will you try again?

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:40.068
The question is "Will we try again?"

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:43.155
This was ours.

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:48.368
Yes, I think maybe Robert wants to go home.

01:35:50.495 --> 01:35:52.622
So, I don't... I don't know.

01:35:56.042 --> 01:35:58.170
Does home call, Dr. Fred?

01:35:59.379 --> 01:36:01.923
I don't really have a home anymore.

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:05.594
There was a moment
when I had everything, but...

01:36:06.887 --> 01:36:09.347
Well, now I don't know what to do.

01:36:13.018 --> 01:36:15.562
When the time comes, you will know.

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:24.154
Well, until then.

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:53.558
Thank you.

01:36:57.562 --> 01:36:59.856
Just gonna say goodbye to Fred.

01:37:01.483 --> 01:37:02.484
Are you sure?

01:37:03.276 --> 01:37:04.694
Sorry?

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:12.285
Listen, Harriet.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:17.499
When I was in the desert,

01:37:17.582 --> 01:37:21.711
the only thing that kept me going
was the thought of you.

01:37:31.263 --> 01:37:33.348
You don't owe me anything.

01:37:35.058 --> 01:37:37.269
I want you to understand that.

01:38:12.429 --> 01:38:13.680
So...

01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:17.142
We're going.

01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:23.773
I'm so sorry, Fred.

01:38:23.857 --> 01:38:27.110
It was an extraordinary idea.
It almost worked, too.

01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.782
I wasn't talking about the project.

01:38:33.533 --> 01:38:35.660
No, I'm not sure that I was.

01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:42.000
I never meant to hurt you like this.

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:43.501
It's not your fault.

01:38:51.176 --> 01:38:53.303
I don't know what to do.

01:38:54.512 --> 01:38:57.015
I can't help you there, I'm afraid.

01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:01.686
Are you going to stay?

01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:04.522
Stay for what?

01:39:06.858 --> 01:39:08.360
There's nothing here anymore.

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:13.531
Not you, not a single fish left in the river.

01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:27.504
Well, someone's gonna have to make a move.
Good luck, Harriet.

01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:34.302
Dr. Alfred, look!

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:43.561
They're alive!

01:39:55.073 --> 01:39:56.741
I'm going to stay.

01:39:58.410 --> 01:40:00.245
I want to start again.

01:40:01.413 --> 01:40:03.373
I'll do it on my own if I have to.

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:05.250
I'll start small, though, this time.

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.503
A different approach.
Just a few fish to begin with.

01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:10.130
Involve the local community more.

01:40:10.422 --> 01:40:13.550
Make it their project, not ours.
That's the way to protect it.

01:40:18.096 --> 01:40:20.140
Do you need an assistant, Dr. Jones?

01:40:20.724 --> 01:40:24.644
Well, I suppose I will.
I'm sure the sheikh has somebody that...

01:40:26.312 --> 01:40:27.772
An assistant?

01:40:30.859 --> 01:40:32.193
A partner.

01:40:34.779 --> 01:40:35.822
A partner.

01:40:39.451 --> 01:40:41.578
Yes, Ms. Chetwode-Talbot.

01:40:43.288 --> 01:40:44.998
More than anything.
