WEBVTT

00:00.250 --> 00:02.334
- Previously, on
"the real housewives
of potomac"...

00:02.370 --> 00:03.869
- Let's talk
about that foot.

00:03.904 --> 00:04.953
I think I'm gonna
keep you in the boot

00:05.006 --> 00:07.873
probably four weeks.
- What?

00:07.908 --> 00:09.174
♪ you make me drive back ♪

00:09.210 --> 00:11.343
- I have a question.
- Sure.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.146
- Is chris gettin' paid
as a manager?

00:14.181 --> 00:16.181
- Ooh... Mia is over there
asking your mama

00:16.217 --> 00:17.766
if chris is gettin' paid.

00:17.802 --> 00:19.385
- Is she now?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.154
- I'm thinking maybe we can
all go to chesapeake bay.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.289
We should bring
our husbands,

00:24.325 --> 00:26.392
and your pa-- your luggage
is gonna be there.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.977
- You're being an asshole,
wendy.

00:29.030 --> 00:30.312
- I'm not your child.
Don't yell at me.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.983
This weekend is going to be
about good vibes only.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.335
- G-v-o!

00:36.370 --> 00:37.736
- So, this room doesn't
have a bathroom.

00:37.772 --> 00:38.871
Are you serious,
right now?

00:38.906 --> 00:39.872
- There's bathrooms
downstairs.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.290
- I'm supposed to go up
and down the stairs.

00:41.325 --> 00:42.574
- And I'm on my period.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.877
- Well, like,
I have a broken toe.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.912
- Anything else?

00:46.947 --> 00:47.846
- She's hungry.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.015
Do you need a--
do you need some lettuce?

00:50.051 --> 00:51.417
- It was low budget.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.751
- Your mother's low budget.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.287
- Oh! Oh!

00:55.322 --> 00:59.024
I don't think candiace knows
about her mom's history.

00:59.060 --> 01:02.294
- My mom has worked
way too ----in' hard.

01:02.313 --> 01:05.397
Her sobriety
is everything to me.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.015
- I have never once talked
sh-- about michael,

01:07.068 --> 01:08.400
ever in life.
- But your wife has,

01:08.436 --> 01:09.601
and that's what has rubbed
my husband so wrong.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.702
- That-- and that's fine.
That's between--

01:10.738 --> 01:12.020
that's between y'all.
- The sh-- michael has said.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.338
- You calling him
a slavedriver?

01:13.374 --> 01:14.406
- Because he drives
his slaves.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.024
- So, you're calling me a slave.
- Stop, right now.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.194
- You are a fowl
----ed up individual.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.412
- Point your finger
all you want!

01:20.448 --> 01:21.280
- Candiace.
- Hey, come on.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.448
- I don't need to go.
I don't need to.

01:22.483 --> 01:23.582
- (bleep) all y'all.
- Chris.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.450
- Chris, sit down.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.619
- I want you to be
the bigger person.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.321
Let some sh-- go.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.595
- This pretty face
is stayin' in the shade.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.432
- If you wanna pop off,

01:40.468 --> 01:43.302
I'll be happy
to get you adjusted.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.386
- I may keep you waiting,

01:44.438 --> 01:48.073
but trust me,
I'm worth it.

01:48.109 --> 01:52.444
- The only thing messier
than two boys is me.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.782
- My blessings are many,
and my patience is none.

01:56.817 --> 02:00.052
- This professor doesn't
just grade on the curve.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.054
She sets the curve.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.723
- The grand dame
can never be duplicated,

02:04.758 --> 02:06.658
imitated, or intimidated.

02:11.715 --> 02:12.498
- Are you gonna be calm?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.699
- I'm-- I was calm
when you left.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.801
We need to go back
to the table.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.503
- Okay.

02:17.538 --> 02:21.473
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.642
- I-- I wanna apologize
to the whole restaurant

02:23.677 --> 02:24.510
before we leave.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.645
We done had a--
we done had a night.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.813
[laughing]

02:27.848 --> 02:29.214
- this is
a pissing contest.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.549
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:30.568 --> 02:31.984
- Nobody's running out
of urine.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.919
- Right.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.556
- If you all let your women
continue down this road,

02:37.575 --> 02:39.074
they're not gonna look
like this at 58.

02:39.109 --> 02:40.125
- Okay.
- Hello. Let them know.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.761
[laughing]
- I'm just sayin'.

02:44.782 --> 02:48.333
- This shrimp is good.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.255
- There's saint michael's inn.
- Okay.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.423
- Seven miles away,

02:54.458 --> 02:56.792
but it's a 2.5 star.

02:56.844 --> 03:00.512
There's a marriott, but it's,
like, 30 miles away.

03:00.548 --> 03:02.014
- Oh, no.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.766
- Wendy's a horrible
hostess.

03:04.802 --> 03:08.136
I would be mortified
if I invited someone

03:08.189 --> 03:10.889
on the trip,
a grown woman,

03:10.924 --> 03:13.275
and she did not have
a bathroom of her own.

03:13.310 --> 03:16.278
So, instead of being
uncomfortable,

03:16.313 --> 03:19.448
the best solution is for us
to find a damn hotel.

03:19.483 --> 03:21.600
- I hope you guys
enjoyed your dinner!

03:21.619 --> 03:22.901
'cause I know everyone
likes an itinerary,

03:22.936 --> 03:24.152
you guys like to know
what we're doing...

03:24.205 --> 03:25.170
- Yes.
- Yeah.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.906
- Tomorrow at noon,
everyone should be ready.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.491
We're going on a boat.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.375
- Better be
a big-ass boat.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.044
- We're gonna have lunch
on the water.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.162
- Oh, yes, I love that.
- Ahh!

03:34.215 --> 03:35.280
- So, I think that
will be super fun.

03:35.299 --> 03:39.167
Since we got here,
this trip has been a nightmare.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.636
I'm enjoying myself

03:40.671 --> 03:44.423
because I'm not wasting
free childcare

03:44.458 --> 03:45.691
on these chicks.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.193
G-v-o!

03:48.229 --> 03:50.062
Let's roll.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.196
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

03:51.232 --> 03:53.332
- Thanks for
putting up with us.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.183
- Hold on.
Let me sober up.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.002
- That was so embarrassing.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.670
- Get your ass in the van!

03:58.706 --> 03:59.938
- I am crippled.

03:59.973 --> 04:00.656
- It was a wild night.

04:00.691 --> 04:03.191
- It was stressful.
- It was.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.310
- Yeah, I'm done.
I'm done wit' y'all.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.446
- Listen,
this was a night.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.850
- Look at what candiace
is doing to chris' head.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.952
- When bitches (bleep) up,
they gotta make up.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.121
- Ooh.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.006
- Mia needs to shut up.

04:18.042 --> 04:19.458
[laughing]

04:19.493 --> 04:23.378
I can totally deal with
and tolerate people

04:23.430 --> 04:25.347
that push buttons,

04:25.382 --> 04:27.933
like ashley
the forehead darby,

04:27.968 --> 04:29.685
okay, if I have to.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.553
- I'm gonna have to take
more advils.

04:38.145 --> 04:39.027
- Look at robyn.
Look at robyn.

04:39.063 --> 04:42.347
Look, robyn and her period
is comin' at me.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.815
Robyn looks miserable.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.200
I think it'd be nice
if juan would show up

04:45.235 --> 04:46.485
and surprise her.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.653
He doesn't have to stay
the whole time.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.154
Just show up.
That would be nice.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.072
That'd be good for robyn.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.373
She could stop hanging out
with gizelle,

04:51.408 --> 04:52.991
who is a bad influence.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.460
- When we get back
to the house,

04:55.496 --> 04:56.695
can we get
some spades going?

04:56.714 --> 04:57.796
- Look, look,
I'm going to bed

04:57.831 --> 04:59.214
'cause I'm gonna get
a piece of ass.

04:59.249 --> 05:00.966
- Oh!
- Did I say that out loud?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.134
I was thinking it.
I didn't mean to say it.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.468
- Apparently,
I'm a piece of ass.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.253
- I'm telling you.

05:05.306 --> 05:06.972
I'm like...

05:07.007 --> 05:09.274
- Ahh, hey, now.
- Gordon!

05:09.310 --> 05:10.676
- Okay, we got that.
- But I'm just sayin'.

05:10.711 --> 05:11.643
- What are you
talking about?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.278
- But guys like
you and him,

05:13.314 --> 05:14.012
average mother-------...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.515
- No, no, no,
don't do that.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.183
Ain't no average
around here.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.186
Listen, the brown dick
is doing what it needs to do.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.270
- His dick ain't brown.
It's white.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.855
- His dick is pink.
I'm sorry.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.740
- It's brown.

05:24.775 --> 05:25.857
- Let me see it.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.109
- Why do people think
it's pink?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.777
[screaming]
- oh! Oh!

05:34.618 --> 05:36.118
- You're making
wendy uncomfortable.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.452
- That's okay.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.171
- Do I wanna see
that brown penis?

05:39.206 --> 05:41.289
Hell no.
No question.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.542
- The dick is pink.
Let me--

05:43.577 --> 05:45.210
- I'm about to get pissed off
and whip it out

05:45.245 --> 05:46.645
and show y'all
I still got it.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.879
- These bitches ain't ready
for that sh--.

05:47.915 --> 05:48.630
- Do it! Do it! Do it!

05:48.682 --> 05:50.649
- Hey, that was--
okay, all right.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.885
[screaming]
- sit your ass down!

05:53.921 --> 05:56.655
[laughing]

05:56.690 --> 05:59.057
- where are my ones
when I need them?

05:59.093 --> 06:00.859
- I'm okay.
I'm all right.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.927
- You all right, now?
- It was a lot. It was a lot.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.528
It was a lot there.
It was a lot there with it.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.864
- I'm scarred for life.
I'm scarred for life.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.333
- Pussy poppin' up
in here and sh--.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.318
- Everyone can talk
about michael,

06:10.371 --> 06:12.821
but at least he knows
how to conduct himself

06:12.873 --> 06:15.207
amongst a group of people
that he just met.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.491
- What's going
on over here?

06:16.543 --> 06:17.509
- What's going on?
- I'm going swimming.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.310
- He's so cute.
- Ashley, we don't do this.

06:18.345 --> 06:21.329
Very cute-- no, no, no.
- Baby.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.348
- Zip up
and put your shoes on.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.884
- Let's do some pussy
poppin' up in here.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.354
- Ashley wants to find
a strip club.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.922
- No, I asked.
- Hey, bus driver!

06:30.957 --> 06:32.841
- No, no, no.
That's not what I said, g.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.011
You said, "we wanna see
a pussy poppin',"

06:36.063 --> 06:37.896
and I said, "g, is there
a strip club nearby?"

06:37.931 --> 06:39.731
then you can go see
some pussy popping.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.999
- I read too much into it.
- Yeah.

06:41.034 --> 06:41.900
- Yes.
- A little it.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.352
- All right. Let's go.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.604
- That's a big-ass
step down.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.606
Come on, ladies.
- All right.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.490
This wind does not stop.

06:48.525 --> 06:49.775
Thank you.
- Oh, chile.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.244
- I'm going to go change
into my pjs.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.246
- Hey, I'm going to bed!

06:54.281 --> 06:55.363
- Good night.
- Good night.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.782
- Me, too.
- It's 12 o'clock.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.718
- Ain't nothin' else
poppin'.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.621
- You ready for the bed?
- Yes, baby.

07:02.656 --> 07:06.675
[sighs]
- okay, robyn dixon.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.594
- Okay.
- Okay, so,

07:09.630 --> 07:11.263
we need to get back
on the hunt for the hotels.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.514
- I don't mind driving
30 minutes.

07:12.549 --> 07:14.099
- Okay, let's go.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.936
- I am really legit tired
of y'all women

07:17.971 --> 07:18.837
goin' at each other.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.405
- I wasn't going at no--
well, I was but--

07:20.441 --> 07:23.391
- and then you go at
somebody's husband.

07:23.444 --> 07:26.945
I felt that I was making
an end road with ashley.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.397
You and candiace don't
always get along,

07:29.450 --> 07:31.316
and michael and I aren't
always on the same page,

07:31.351 --> 07:33.151
but I do wanna say
motherhood on you

07:33.186 --> 07:34.352
looks real, real good.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.487
- I appreciate you
saying that.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.189
Uh, her, on the other hand,
your wife called me wide,

07:38.208 --> 07:40.992
and I didn't really
appreciate that comment.

07:41.028 --> 07:44.129
- And then that bitch
took a side road...

07:44.164 --> 07:45.413
[sighs]

07:45.466 --> 07:48.416
because that's
what raggedy bitches do.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.553
- What she knew was,
you would respond,

07:51.588 --> 07:52.971
and you played
right into it.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.890
I'm gonna say this,

It's dramamine.

not proper planning.

feel very awkward.

needs to be had.

28:34.063 --> 28:36.213
- Any conversation I have
with wendy about anything

28:36.232 --> 28:38.899
can turn into a debate
or confrontational,

28:38.934 --> 28:40.217

interested in that.

what was said?

You don't even have
a relationship

- Shut the (bleep) up!

28:47.193 --> 28:48.742
Askale, I could say,
"the sky is blue,"

28:48.778 --> 28:50.060
and she's going to
debate me on it,

28:50.079 --> 28:51.278
and I'm interested.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.329
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.247
- Like, that's just as
simple as it is for me.

28:53.282 --> 28:56.750
So, I'd rather just
keep the interaction

28:56.786 --> 28:58.001
to a minimum.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.420
- This is nice
and relaxing.

- We need this nice
and relaxing after yesterday,

Thank you so much.

29:07.913 --> 29:09.797

gonna avoid her?

29:09.849 --> 29:12.582
- It's not avoiding her.
It's just, um...

29:12.601 --> 29:14.518
- Ooh.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.470
- Just gonna
keep it simple.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.088
- Do you like her?

29:18.124 --> 29:19.807
- I don't know.
- Okay.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.642
- You know, over a year ago
when I met her,

29:21.694 --> 29:22.810
we hit it off.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.361
I thought she was
down to earth.

29:24.396 --> 29:27.948
So, I have libations.
- Did you? Yes!

29:27.983 --> 29:29.233
- I think I'm gonna
have the margarita.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.985
- Okay, yes.

29:32.037 --> 29:35.372
- I thought, you know,
we-we-- we clicked,

29:35.407 --> 29:38.041
and I'm kinda thinking
maybe I was wrong.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.776
That's just how I feel.

29:39.795 --> 29:41.912
- Like, I really
love wendy.

29:41.947 --> 29:45.332
The fact that the person
I am friends with is, like,

29:45.384 --> 29:48.635
feuding with people that
I am friends with now,

29:48.671 --> 29:51.588
it just makes me
feel very torn.

29:54.009 --> 29:55.292
- I don't want you
to feel like that.

29:55.311 --> 29:56.677
Do you know what I mean?
Like, I don't--

29:56.729 --> 29:59.129
like, I would never
be upset with you

29:59.148 --> 30:00.681
for being close
with anyone or...

30:00.733 --> 30:02.533
- No, yeah.
No, I know you wouldn't.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.818
- Wendy.
- Yes.

30:04.854 --> 30:06.236
- I heard that you're
not the same person

30:06.272 --> 30:08.489
that you were
a year ago downstairs.

30:08.524 --> 30:10.240
- Who said that?

30:12.444 --> 30:15.312
- Robyn.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.247
- You're damn right
I'm not the same person I was

30:17.283 --> 30:19.116
a year ago,
'cause we grow.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.585
We evolve as women.
We evolve.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.871
And if she's the same person
she was a year ago,

30:23.923 --> 30:25.389
then she needs to change.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.341
She needs to
mother------' evolve.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.727
- Hey.
- Sh--.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.714
- Welcome back, friends.

30:33.766 --> 30:35.399
- Did you miss us?
It wasn't that long.

30:35.434 --> 30:36.333
- Sort of.

30:36.352 --> 30:38.635
Wendy might not miss you,
but I missed you.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.737
I overheard
your conversation.

30:40.773 --> 30:42.906
- So, she came up
and reported it

30:42.942 --> 30:45.058
to the group.
- Oh.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.276
What was the conversation?

30:46.312 --> 30:49.246
- That wendy is not the
same person she was a year ago.

30:49.281 --> 30:52.015
- I said our friendship
is not what it was.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.884
Over a year ago,
when I met her, I thought,

30:53.919 --> 30:57.070
you know, we clicked,
and I'm kinda thinkin'

30:57.122 --> 30:58.655
maybe I was wrong.

30:58.691 --> 31:01.091
- That's completely different
than what you said, mia.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.743
- You are not good
at telephone.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.194
- It's a mia's dictionary.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.696
- Mia, we're gonna
work on telephone tag.

31:05.731 --> 31:09.416
- Mia likes to embellish
a little bit on the stories

31:09.468 --> 31:11.168
and the things
that she hears.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.586
- I would love for you
to explain to me

31:12.638 --> 31:15.005
why the moment I left
the house, you said,

31:15.040 --> 31:16.506
"she's a weak bitch."

31:16.541 --> 31:18.208
- who said that?
- When did she say that?

31:18.244 --> 31:20.210
- You did.
- I didn't say that.

31:20.229 --> 31:22.779
- Well, that's what
I interpreted it as.

31:22.815 --> 31:25.015
- Huh?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.316
- Stop, mia.
- See?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.235
- You gotta love
mia for who she is.

31:28.270 --> 31:30.087
That thing is
a space cadet, okay?

31:30.122 --> 31:31.772
We love you, mia.

31:31.824 --> 31:34.057
[laughing]

31:34.093 --> 31:35.993
- if I was wrong,
then I'm wrong,

31:36.028 --> 31:37.628
and I'm woman enough
to say I was wrong.

31:37.663 --> 31:38.595
- Amen.

31:38.631 --> 31:39.997
- Okay, so, your friendship
is not the same.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.282
- Okay.
- But why isn't it the same?

31:42.334 --> 31:45.202
- I'm not interested in
engaging in a-- in a debate,

31:45.237 --> 31:47.454
so there's nothin'
for me to discuss.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.006
That's it.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.123
- Okay, that's how you feel.
- I think--

31:50.175 --> 31:52.075
- this isn't awkward at all.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.977
This is very comfortable.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.979
- No, you just know where
people are in your life,

31:56.015 --> 31:58.582
when you're an adult,
and you place them.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.150
That's it.

32:01.820 --> 32:02.936
- Coming up next...

32:02.972 --> 32:06.974
- To refer to something that
I have put my spirit into,

32:07.026 --> 32:10.327
I was hurt
by what you said.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.633
- There is nothin'
for me to discuss.

32:16.669 --> 32:17.968
That's it.

32:18.003 --> 32:18.919
- When you're an adult,

32:18.971 --> 32:20.771
you just know where people
are in your life,

32:20.806 --> 32:24.341
and you place them.
That's it.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.343
Please understand
that while you guys

32:26.378 --> 32:28.478
may have your issues
with me as a person,

32:28.514 --> 32:30.981
any conversation
that wants to be had,

32:31.016 --> 32:32.382
I welcome
and invite it.

32:32.401 --> 32:35.686
And with that, gizelle,
all I say is,

32:35.721 --> 32:37.104
I have been gracious.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.388
I was a nice host.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.957
Nobody was
relegated to a room.

32:39.992 --> 32:41.491
Everybody got to pick.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.443
The house was booked
before anything happened

32:43.495 --> 32:45.295
to gizelle's toe.
- This is your trip.

32:45.331 --> 32:46.246
You're the host.
- Correct.

32:46.281 --> 32:48.465
- Everybody knew robyn
and I were leaving.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.199
- I-- I didn't know.
- No, that was after.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.118
That was after
you had left.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.536
That, yeah, that--
nobody knew.

32:52.571 --> 32:54.254
- Okay, well,
but-but in the text,

32:54.289 --> 32:56.206
there was no like,
"are y'all okay?

32:56.241 --> 32:58.508
Did y'all get hit
by freddy kreuger?

32:58.544 --> 32:59.793
Did y'all make
it to the hotel?"

32:59.845 --> 33:01.044
you checked on us.
- I did. Yes.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.079
- Thank you very much.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.296
- Askale text you
in a group.

33:03.349 --> 33:04.514
We didn't need
to worry about you

33:04.550 --> 33:07.017
because you said you
checked in safely.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.385
- You made the choice.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.519
I'm not-I'm not mad about it.
- But you can't blame the host.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.721
- I don't understand what
the conversation is about.

33:10.756 --> 33:12.589
- But you can't blame the host.
- I'm not mad about it.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.091
I did what made me
feel cofortable.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.525
I didn't feel comfortable
being in a house

33:15.561 --> 33:17.794
where men are using
the bath-- that same bathroom

33:17.830 --> 33:19.029
and pissing
all on the floor.

33:19.064 --> 33:20.364
I'm a germaphobe.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.834
- I-I-I didn't piss
on the floor.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.202
Who-who pissed
on the floor?

33:25.237 --> 33:26.486
- Y'all be pissin'
on the floor.

33:26.538 --> 33:28.288
- Wasn't me.
I can tell ya that.

33:28.323 --> 33:29.840
- You just go there.
- I guarantee you

33:29.875 --> 33:31.825
it wasn't me.
- You just go there.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.827
- Everybody got
a little drop.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.829
- I suspect
your piss, robyn.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.280
I think robyn
peed on the floor.

33:37.316 --> 33:38.799
You just want these men
up and outta here

33:38.834 --> 33:39.883
'cause you ain't
comfortable.

33:39.918 --> 33:43.420
- I found a solution that
made me feel comfortable,

33:43.455 --> 33:45.088
but I'm not mad at it at all.
- Perfect, okay, okay.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.473
- Okay, I respect it.
- Cool.

33:46.508 --> 33:49.693
- I mean, I think gizelle
maybe might want more,

33:49.728 --> 33:50.827
but I didn't want nothin'.

33:50.863 --> 33:51.862
- I'm cool on wendy.
I'm good.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.630
- Yeah, we've been good.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.065
Next question?

33:55.100 --> 33:57.868
- It's always combative.
It's always aggressive.

33:57.903 --> 33:59.152
- No, but you're
always a mean girl,

33:59.188 --> 34:00.670
and you're always
a bully.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.005
- Thanks, thank you.
- Yeah, you're a mean girl,

34:02.041 --> 34:03.140
and you're a bully.
- Thank you.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.641
- Why are we having this
conversation around the guys?

34:04.660 --> 34:05.509
Like, do y'all wanna
hear this bullsh--?

34:05.544 --> 34:06.777
- Yeah, maybe they
can go downstairs.

34:06.812 --> 34:07.778
- They're already in it.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.696
- We-we know when to
chime in and when not to.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.581
- Yeah, they're good.
- And-and we're doin' okay.

34:11.617 --> 34:12.833
- And-and it's
mostly not to.

34:12.868 --> 34:15.085
- Yeah, I think
we're doing okay, ray.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.520
I think we're doing good.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.522
- I'm about to go
sunbathe and pump, okay?

34:18.557 --> 34:20.874
I am so glad michael
did not come on this trip.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.826
He would have been
pissed at me

34:22.845 --> 34:25.262
if I brought him on
this boat for this, okay?

34:25.297 --> 34:26.847
- I really feel like they-they
just want their own time.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.301
- Are we all going
downstairs?

34:34.556 --> 34:36.273
- I just--
I want some sun.

34:36.308 --> 34:38.475
Right.
- Yes, nipples.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.644
Oh, my god, they're--
it's so scary looking.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.896
- It looks like
an uncircumcised penis

34:42.948 --> 34:44.731
coming out of its skin.
- It does.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.616
Eww! It does look like it.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.034
- It looks like
a dog's penis.

34:48.070 --> 34:51.204
- What?
[laughing]

34:51.240 --> 34:52.322
I don't know what.
- Ashley.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.224
- It's-it's too cold
downstairs.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.459
- You got some cards?

34:55.494 --> 34:56.793
- Absolutely.
- What we gotta play?

34:56.829 --> 34:58.628
- Spades.
- Sh--, I'm in.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.797
I'm gonna whip
somebody's ass.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.249
[laughing]

35:02.301 --> 35:04.251
- did you-- I--
did you guys resolve it?

35:04.303 --> 35:05.602
- No, it's not resolved.
That's what it is.

35:05.637 --> 35:06.636
There is no resolution.
- No. See?

35:06.672 --> 35:07.471
And that's why we need
to still talk about it.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.422
- Girl, well,
how about you talk?

35:09.475 --> 35:10.640
You and candiace can talk
since you wanna resolve

35:10.676 --> 35:11.475
somethin' so bad.
- We can talk.

35:11.510 --> 35:12.342
- Yes, we do need to talk.
- Yeah.

35:12.377 --> 35:13.276
- Y'all-y'all-y'all
can resolve this.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.043
- We are.
- Yeah, y'all can resolve this.

35:14.062 --> 35:15.929
- I-I would love
to talk about it.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.147
- Yeah, y'all resolve it.
Resolve it.

35:17.182 --> 35:18.315
- Do you wanna
talk right here?

35:18.350 --> 35:20.150
- We can talk.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.885
Okay, so, I'll start it.

35:23.238 --> 35:25.722
Obviously, I said something
that struck a nerve

35:25.741 --> 35:26.957
with you, right?

35:26.992 --> 35:29.493
And I know that I'm just now
getting a chance to know you.

35:29.528 --> 35:33.280
I never want to be
responsible for inflicting,

35:33.332 --> 35:36.583
like, negative energy
onto someone.

35:36.618 --> 35:39.269
I own that,
and I'm sorry for that.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.538
The only question
I asked was,

35:41.573 --> 35:44.240
who is the manager,
and is he getting paid?

35:44.259 --> 35:45.509
- Okay, well,
let's stop there.

35:45.544 --> 35:47.577
Why is it appropriate
to ask my mom

35:47.596 --> 35:49.296
a question like that?
- Ooh.

35:49.348 --> 35:52.849
- And I'll apologize
for hurting you

35:52.885 --> 35:54.451
by asking questions

35:54.486 --> 35:57.487
that maybe is
none of my business.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.889
- I appreciate you saying
that, but it--

35:58.924 --> 36:02.526
really, it wasn't
the questions to my mom

36:02.561 --> 36:04.260
that triggered me so much

36:04.279 --> 36:07.297
as the-the comment
about my project.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.698
- Mm-hmm.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.001
I wanted to be there,
but I wanted to show up

36:11.036 --> 36:12.536
to something that
wasn't low budget,

36:12.571 --> 36:13.837
is what I wanted.
- Oh, lord!

36:13.872 --> 36:15.155
- Your mama is low budget.
Watch your mouth.

36:15.207 --> 36:17.440
- Oh!

36:17.476 --> 36:19.576
- I was definitely...

36:19.611 --> 36:20.710
[sighs]
I don't wanna cry.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.914
I was-I was hurt
by what you said.

36:28.453 --> 36:32.789
Because I have
worked so hard

36:32.824 --> 36:37.327
to, like, really live out
this dream, again,

36:37.362 --> 36:40.296
and it's really
important to me.

36:40.315 --> 36:44.401
I don't know
if I'm doing it right,

36:44.436 --> 36:46.436
and I'm scared.

36:48.073 --> 36:49.406
- Coming up next...

36:49.441 --> 36:50.907
- Hey, guys,
look at ashley.

36:52.578 --> 36:53.777
- May I please be
in my corner,

36:53.812 --> 36:55.045
and you stay on
your side of the car?

36:55.080 --> 36:56.112
- Oh, you can stay
in your corner,

37:02.570 --> 37:05.922
- I was hurt
by what you said.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.559
I don't know
if I'm doing it right.

37:10.579 --> 37:13.880
I'm scared if it's going
to be received well.

37:13.916 --> 37:15.782
I don't ever wanna
feel like

37:15.817 --> 37:17.183
something that I'm doing

37:17.219 --> 37:21.154
is not being respected
at the very least.

37:21.189 --> 37:22.689
Um...
- Yeah, trust me, I get it.

37:22.724 --> 37:23.957
- Yeah.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.726
You don't have to, you know,
und-understand or appreciate

37:26.762 --> 37:28.227
my creative journey,

37:28.247 --> 37:31.531
but at least respect it.

37:31.566 --> 37:32.749
- I'm sorry for that.
- Thank you.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.367
- Now, I know
my boundaries with you.

37:34.403 --> 37:36.620
- Yeah, yeah.
- And I'll be mindful of that.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.872
And I'll try not to
purposely hurt you.

37:38.907 --> 37:41.258
- Thank you.
I appreciate you saying that.

37:41.293 --> 37:44.511
- I never want to
intentionally hurt someone,

37:44.546 --> 37:46.930
but I'm going to
forever be honest,

37:46.965 --> 37:50.717
and now I can kinda know
how to maneuver around candiace.

37:50.752 --> 37:52.218
- So, now to you.

37:52.253 --> 37:56.589
I was not aware
that you had stuff

37:56.608 --> 37:58.725
with your mom.
- Mm-hmm.

37:58.760 --> 38:02.979
- Honestly, when I said,
"your mother is low budget,"

38:03.031 --> 38:07.534
I did not realize that
I was pushing a button in you

38:07.569 --> 38:10.620
that is traumatic
and hurtful.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.139
I don't ever wanna
be responsible for

38:13.175 --> 38:15.275
contributing
to that kind of hurt.

38:15.310 --> 38:17.010
- I would prefer for you
to attack me, always.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.212
- Yes.
- Because, I mean,

38:19.247 --> 38:20.997
she did time in prison.

38:21.049 --> 38:23.416
She is a recovering addict,

38:23.451 --> 38:24.818
and she's doing well
for herself,

38:24.853 --> 38:26.753
and she's really strong
into her word.

38:26.788 --> 38:28.421
She goes to church.

38:28.456 --> 38:30.457
She reads her bible
every morning.

38:30.492 --> 38:31.958
I just don't want her
to be hurt

38:31.994 --> 38:34.194
by anybody's comment

38:34.229 --> 38:35.929
that she had
nothing to do with.

38:35.964 --> 38:37.230
- Yeah.
- It's not fair.

38:37.265 --> 38:39.399
- Yeah, I understand.
- Um, because she's
worked too hard

38:39.434 --> 38:40.433
for her sobriety.
- Yeah.

38:40.468 --> 38:41.985
- And I want her to stay there.
- Yeah, yeah.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.036
- How long has
she been sober?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.854
- Ten years.
- That's-that's phenomenal.

38:44.906 --> 38:46.305
- Yeah, it is.
- And it's everything.

38:46.325 --> 38:47.974
- Wow.
- She was in prison for eight.

38:47.993 --> 38:49.492
- Wow.
- Eight years?

38:49.528 --> 38:51.978
- Her mom and her dad
both died

38:51.997 --> 38:53.013
while she was in prison,

38:53.048 --> 38:54.047
so she didn't get
a chance

38:54.082 --> 38:56.416
to bury her parents.
- Oh.

38:56.451 --> 38:57.951
- Typically, they let
people out for--

38:57.986 --> 38:59.352
to bury their parents.

38:59.388 --> 39:01.254
- So, we were able
to get her out.

39:01.289 --> 39:02.539
- Uh-huh.
- She chose not to

39:02.591 --> 39:03.506
because they wouldn't take
the shackles off of her ankles,

39:03.542 --> 39:05.041
and she didn't wanna
come into the church--

39:05.093 --> 39:06.292
- oh.
- Oh, my god.

39:06.327 --> 39:08.294
- ...In shackles.
- That's terrible.

39:08.330 --> 39:09.796
- Aww.
- Ugh.

39:11.666 --> 39:14.367
Girl, get the girl a--
get her a napkin.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.606
I know how I have felt
having my mom issues.

39:19.641 --> 39:22.008
I can't imagine
going through

39:22.027 --> 39:23.509
what mia has gone through.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.744
- Thank you for
sharing, mia.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.679
- Yeah.
- That was a hard day.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.482
I'm sorry 'cause
my grandmother was everything,

39:29.517 --> 39:31.084
you know.
- Yeah.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.552
- Yeah.

39:32.587 --> 39:35.071
- She did the best
that she could with-with her.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.689
- Aww.

39:36.725 --> 39:40.660
- I'm grateful that I have
been given this information

39:40.695 --> 39:43.663
about who she is
for real.

39:43.698 --> 39:45.799
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're good.

39:45.834 --> 39:49.569
- Girl, don't apologize.
We cry in this group.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.372
- Some more than others.
- Some more than others.

39:52.407 --> 39:54.391
[laughing]
- I'm a crier.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.442
- Well, thank you.
- But thank you for saying

39:55.477 --> 39:56.476
I'm--

39:56.511 --> 39:57.477

Thank you, wendy.

40:02.884 --> 40:05.101
This is very nice.
- Thank you.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.119
- Yeah, this is cute.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.120
- A little getaway
not too far from the kids.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.289
- I hope you guys got
to enjoy it and relax.

40:09.324 --> 40:10.190
I love water.

40:10.225 --> 40:11.791
Water is, like,
the element that I love.

40:11.827 --> 40:13.059
- You're about to
get your ass tore up.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.327
- I still got ten.

40:14.362 --> 40:16.396
- Nine.
- We bid nine.

40:16.431 --> 40:17.464
Are we docking now?

40:17.499 --> 40:18.965
- I think we're coming
to a dock.

40:20.702 --> 40:22.419
- All right, ladies,

40:22.454 --> 40:23.569
- Thank you.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.074

40:28.093 --> 40:28.925
- Do you need a hand?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.409
- I'm just gonna take
my sweet time.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.344
- You got it.

40:31.379 --> 40:32.411
Thank you.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.346
- I need a nap
before dinner.

40:33.381 --> 40:35.048
You know, I always
get an afternoon nap.

40:35.083 --> 40:36.049
I didn't get it today.

40:36.084 --> 40:36.883
- Did y'all have fun?

40:36.918 --> 40:38.384
- Yeah, we had
a lot of fun, y'all.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.303
- Ooh, snacks.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.355
- Whoo-hoo!

40:42.390 --> 40:44.757
- Oh, girl.
- I am exhausted.

40:44.793 --> 40:45.892
Oh, snacks!

40:45.927 --> 40:47.727
- Anything gluten free
in there?

40:47.762 --> 40:49.395
- We have snacks
up here, guys.

40:49.431 --> 40:51.164
Anyone want snacks?
- I do.

40:51.199 --> 40:52.899
- Is one of them
a patron snack?

40:52.934 --> 40:55.401
- Ahh!

40:55.437 --> 40:56.436
- Look it.

40:56.471 --> 40:58.438
What the hell y'all do
to ashley?

40:58.473 --> 40:59.572
- She needed a nap.

40:59.608 --> 41:00.790
- Hey, guys,

41:00.826 --> 41:01.941
- Oh, my god.
- What the (bleep)?

41:01.977 --> 41:02.642
- You don't mind
your own business.

41:02.677 --> 41:04.110
- Ashley, what the--?
- G,

41:04.146 --> 41:05.612
can you stay on that side
of the car, please?

41:05.647 --> 41:06.846
- Yes, ma'am.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.882
- I've caught ashley
with her mouth open.

41:08.917 --> 41:10.333
- Her man is doing
like this against her.

41:10.385 --> 41:12.051
- I'm sorry.

41:13.455 --> 41:14.487
- Ashley, I swear I didn't
know you were awake.

41:14.523 --> 41:16.322
I wouldn't have said sh--
if I knew you were awake.

41:16.358 --> 41:17.257
- Uh-uh, really?

41:17.292 --> 41:18.591
- Why are you saying
anything, period, g?

41:18.627 --> 41:19.625
I'm just trying to
take a little nap.

41:19.644 --> 41:20.593
I'm tired.
- I didn't say anything.

41:20.629 --> 41:21.728
Dre, did I say anything?

41:21.763 --> 41:23.429
- You just did
to the whole bus.

41:23.465 --> 41:25.431
- Tell him to leave
you alone, ashley.

41:25.466 --> 41:26.900
- I have a newborn at home.

41:26.935 --> 41:30.186
I get no chance
to get good sleep.

41:30.238 --> 41:33.189
His behavior irks me
to no end.

41:33.241 --> 41:35.208
- But you look-- you do look
funny as sh-- over there.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.860
[laughing]

41:36.912 --> 41:38.644
- yeah, but I'm
on my side of the car.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.330
- So, what's your point?
- So-so, may I please

41:40.365 --> 41:42.382
be in my corner, and you stay
on your side of the car?

41:42.417 --> 41:43.416
- Oh, you can stay
in your corner,

41:43.451 --> 41:44.450
but I am gonna talk
about ya.

41:44.485 --> 41:45.368
- Why?
- You can stay--

41:45.420 --> 41:46.503
'cause it was fun.
- Why-why don't you--

41:46.538 --> 41:47.720
why don't you talk to mia?

41:47.756 --> 41:49.589
I mean, your definition
of fun is a little warped then.

41:53.828 --> 41:55.828
Next time, on "the real
housewives of potomac"...

41:55.847 --> 41:57.496
- Y'all ready
for a crab boil?

41:57.516 --> 41:59.532
- Yes, karen!
- Yes.

41:59.568 --> 42:01.000
- Karen-karen is
squattin' in there.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.335
- Is she naked?

42:02.370 --> 42:03.853
- We're about to see.
[laughing]

42:03.889 --> 42:06.839
- please, god,
let karen be clothed.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.526
- All: Three, two, one!

42:09.561 --> 42:11.578
[screaming]

42:11.613 --> 42:13.730
- gordon just wouldn't
let me sleep in the corner.

42:13.782 --> 42:15.148
- What corner?
- On the bus, g.

42:15.183 --> 42:16.482
- What are you talk--
what bus? When?

42:16.518 --> 42:18.451
- You got alzheimer's?
What's happening?

42:18.486 --> 42:19.519
- Where is your husband?

42:19.554 --> 42:20.987
It's a couples trip.
- At home with my children.

42:21.022 --> 42:22.088
- Are you sure?

42:22.123 --> 42:23.239
- Oh, yeah.
- Ahh!

42:25.493 --> 42:27.093
- Do you like that?
- Mmm.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.429
I'm feeling very
uncomfortable right now.

42:29.464 --> 42:33.633
- Even if I offer to have
some sort of sexual intimacy,

42:33.668 --> 42:35.168
he doesn't want it.

42:35.203 --> 42:36.719
- Do you believe him?

42:38.240 --> 42:40.273
- There is a package!

42:40.308 --> 42:41.540
[gasps]

42:41.560 --> 42:44.043
- oh, what the hell
is that?

42:44.062 --> 42:44.978
[screaming]

42:45.013 --> 42:46.713
- it's, like, it's hard
to, like, look up

42:46.748 --> 42:50.567
to you or dad because,
like, we don't see you,

42:50.602 --> 42:53.903
like, in relationships.

42:53.939 --> 42:56.122
- Wow, this is, like,
worse than I thought.
