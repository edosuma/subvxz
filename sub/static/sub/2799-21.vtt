00:18.000 --> 00:19.232
Stop!

00:19.607 --> 00:20.939
Stop!

00:21.581 --> 00:22.736
Stop!

00:44.861 --> 00:46.404
Why do we always come here?

00:46.768 --> 00:50.250
- Open 24 hours.
- Everything in Vegas is open 24 hours.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.446
It's cheap.

00:51.824 --> 00:54.726
Smells like bacon in here.
Slide over.

00:55.167 --> 00:58.516
That scene took forever.
We were there like, what, nine hours?

00:58.516 --> 00:59.310
Eleven.

00:59.318 --> 01:02.443
A dead lawyer and 200 eyewitnesses--
it's going to take a while.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.122
Come for a wedding, stay for the funeral.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.123
Why do we always eat here?

01:08.123 --> 01:10.277
- It's tradition.
- Ah, tradition.

01:10.278 --> 01:13.591
Like becoming property exchange between your father and your husband?

01:13.596 --> 01:18.052
Oh, that's not what a wedding is.
It's a public declaration of love.

01:18.345 --> 01:19.771
I'm with Vince Vaughn on this one.

01:19.777 --> 01:23.883
Dozens of horny, single women with access to an open bar and coupling on their mind.

01:23.885 --> 01:27.160
Weddings are a Rorschach.
Everybody sees what they want to see.

01:27.365 --> 01:29.061
My first five were good.

01:30.195 --> 01:34.351
Noted criminal defense attorney, Diane Chase was killed yesterday...

01:34.457 --> 01:37.371
We haven't even gone back to the lab yet, and we're already on TV.

01:37.376 --> 01:41.331
In a tragic twist, Ms. Chase was killed while attending her son's wedding.

01:41.337 --> 01:44.161
She was best known for taking on the toughest cases,

01:44.166 --> 01:47.912
and it was her defense of high-profile, organized crime associates

01:47.916 --> 01:50.783
that really made her a name in legal circles.

01:50.787 --> 01:53.970
If it was an intelligent question, I'd stop to answer it.

01:53.976 --> 01:58.872
Most recently, she represented Dino Fatelli of the Fatelli crime family,

01:58.878 --> 02:00.941
who was sentenced to life last month

02:00.946 --> 02:04.571
for the brutal slaying of casino mogul Remy James.

02:04.576 --> 02:07.661
The stones on these guys--
to take her out at her son's wedding?

02:08.104 --> 02:09.473
Pass the cream, will you?

02:17.585 --> 02:20.331
Dude, where's your car?

02:20.895 --> 02:22.063
It's parked right...

02:34.908 --> 02:35.850
Incoming.

02:36.008 --> 02:38.852
I'll talk.
You guys just look apologetic.

02:42.445 --> 02:44.991
All right, let me see if I understand this correctly.

02:44.996 --> 02:47.010
You let one of the members of your team drive

02:47.017 --> 02:50.443
his personal vehicle to a crime scene investigation;

02:50.545 --> 02:54.420
and then, even though there was a perfectly good crime scene vehicle there,

02:54.426 --> 02:58.910
that personal car was crammed with every bit of evidence collected

02:58.915 --> 03:04.683
at a major murder investigation, because two of you were maxed out on overtime.

03:04.686 --> 03:11.772
And then the driver, of said car, instead of securing that evidence in the lab,

03:12.258 --> 03:15.430
gave priority to his need for runny eggs.

03:15.988 --> 03:21.670
And the aforementioned vehicle was stolen from a parking lot filled with police cars.

03:23.326 --> 03:24.801
Is there anything I missed?

03:24.805 --> 03:25.841
Just this:

03:25.848 --> 03:27.920
Even if we recover the vehicle,

03:28.265 --> 03:31.691
the chain of custody has been broken,
so all the evidence has been compromised.

03:31.697 --> 03:34.543
No judge will allow any of it to be admitted into court.

03:34.546 --> 03:38.331
Also, we released the crime scene, so it, too, is compromised,

03:38.336 --> 03:40.402
leaving us nothing to go back for.

03:40.867 --> 03:44.342
Thank you for clarifying the situation.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.611
It could've been worse.

04:26.107 --> 04:29.701
We were seated at a booth, with clear visual access to the vehicle.

04:29.708 --> 04:31.990
A delivery truck pulls up, blocks our view.

04:31.995 --> 04:34.771
- For how long?
- Two, three minutes, tops.

04:34.848 --> 04:36.011
What kind of truck?

04:36.686 --> 04:39.561
Bread, dairy...
I can't remember.

04:39.568 --> 04:42.930
- Did you have an alarm?
- Yeah. Yeah, it didn't go off.

04:43.486 --> 04:45.412
- Are you sure it was locked?
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.581
And I have a tracking system on my truck, too.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.733
I called it in as soon as I realized it was missing.

04:49.738 --> 04:50.750
Okay. I'll follow up.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.260
There's about a dozen places to hide a tracking system on a car.

04:53.266 --> 04:55.913
- I'm sure the Fatellis know 'em all.
- No broken glass.

04:55.917 --> 04:58.323
No bolts from a disengaged transmission.

04:58.328 --> 05:01.050
No tire treads or skid marks.

05:02.058 --> 05:03.950
Hey, Jim.

05:06.108 --> 05:07.510
I need a ride.

05:14.307 --> 05:17.231
Internal Affairs Bureau is coming to take our statements.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.982
They'll want to know what's been lost.

05:18.987 --> 05:21.460
So let's not make ourselves look any worse than we already do.

05:21.466 --> 05:25.302
Write down everything-- evidence collected, interview notes, etc...

05:25.308 --> 05:26.780
Every detail.

05:26.785 --> 05:29.873
No one leaves until they've given their account of the event.

05:43.306 --> 05:46.011
So aside from the accident,
Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?

05:46.175 --> 05:47.202
Not good.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.903
Fatelli was handled by the day shift.
Let's pull the file.

05:49.907 --> 05:52.353
And compare it to what?
We've got no crime scene photos.

05:52.357 --> 05:54.771
I have mine, but they're only of the ballroom.

05:54.976 --> 05:57.441
But every wedding these days has a videographer.

05:57.446 --> 05:58.840
We got to get the video.

06:57.556 --> 06:59.432
Oh. Hey, Grissom.

06:59.576 --> 07:01.471
I'm sorry to hear about the setback.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.881
Yeah, well, it's all about the body now, David.

07:04.945 --> 07:08.613
There was a vital response in the ligature marks around her ankles.

07:08.957 --> 07:10.361
So she might have been unconscious,

07:10.365 --> 07:13.553
but she probably was still alive when she was tied to the car.

07:13.656 --> 07:16.522
Yeah, all the significant trauma was to the back of her head.

07:17.096 --> 07:19.103
We'll know more after autopsy.

07:19.558 --> 07:21.960
So you tell me how I'm going to spin this thing.

07:21.965 --> 07:24.361
I've got a dead lawyer, a known enemy of the department,

07:24.367 --> 07:26.523
who made her career picking us apart.

07:26.527 --> 07:28.751
And now, we've lost the evidence in her murder.

07:28.757 --> 07:29.891
Even I don't buy it.

07:29.896 --> 07:33.642
- Well, the Fatellis are on our radar.
- Press is going to eat us alive.

07:34.006 --> 07:37.682
Six month trial, we finally get Fatelli shipped off to Lompoc.

07:37.726 --> 07:39.382
He's not even in the state.

07:39.785 --> 07:41.291
How long are his arms?

07:41.637 --> 07:42.700
I talked to the feds.

07:42.707 --> 07:44.823
They're checking the call logs, visitors' logs.

07:44.827 --> 07:46.801
It's going to look like the CSIs were paid off.

07:46.808 --> 07:50.503
Nobody's going to believe that this was an unfortunate series of coincidences.

07:51.696 --> 07:54.611
So my choices are: we're idiots, or we're dirty.

07:55.145 --> 07:56.411
So which are we?

07:56.415 --> 07:59.921
It was a big scene. I threw tons of stuff into the back of your truck.

07:59.925 --> 08:01.901
Figured I'd just sort it out later.

08:01.906 --> 08:05.223
Print lifts, swabs, my camera.

08:05.935 --> 08:10.101
Well, maybe if we talk it out, it will help.

08:10.776 --> 08:13.961
I started with the "Just Married" convertible.

08:14.025 --> 08:16.400
Well, thankfully, that didn't get stolen. Where is it?

08:16.407 --> 08:20.753
Because of possible Fatelli involvement,
the undersheriff ordered it swept at the scene

08:20.757 --> 08:22.651
before they brought it back to the lab.

08:22.656 --> 08:23.781
It could be hours.

08:24.106 --> 08:25.593
Did you get anything from it?

08:26.976 --> 08:28.083
Prints...

08:31.837 --> 08:33.671
I remember David saying...

08:34.078 --> 08:37.159
"You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day."

08:38.636 --> 08:41.561
So there we were at Cupid's Kiss,

08:41.566 --> 08:45.623
a Nuptial Neverland where the cheese factor was dangerously high

08:45.627 --> 08:50.331
and the flowers were obviously fake.

08:51.658 --> 08:55.031
Can the love be real when the flowers aren't?

09:07.007 --> 09:09.710
Oh, you really have a thing about weddings, don't you?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.751
Hey, I didn't interview them.

09:12.235 --> 09:14.051
It was just my impression.

09:20.506 --> 09:22.643
Hi, there. Hi.
I'm, uh, Sara Sidle.

09:22.647 --> 09:25.370
- I'm with the crime lab.
- Bryce Gundy, groom's side.

09:25.378 --> 09:28.352
Did you guys decorate the wedding car with those beer cans?

09:28.356 --> 09:30.481
- Yep.
- Did you drink all the beer first?

09:30.485 --> 09:31.810
- Yep.
- Awesome.

09:31.815 --> 09:34.270
Did you also tie the groom's mom to the bumper?

09:34.648 --> 09:35.831
- Nope.
- Good chat.

09:35.838 --> 09:38.743
Um, I'm going to need to get your fingerprints

09:38.747 --> 09:41.372
so I can compare them to the prints that I got off the car.

09:41.378 --> 09:42.612
Cool.

09:43.015 --> 09:45.122
You are aware that someone has died?

09:45.125 --> 09:49.220
Nobody's going to miss her except her son and her cell phone provider.

09:49.226 --> 09:52.151
- Oh, what do you mean?
- She's creepy close to Adam.

09:52.156 --> 09:54.431
Must have called him 15 times a day.

09:54.438 --> 09:55.333
Huh.

09:55.336 --> 09:58.233
Do you mind just putting your finger right here?

09:58.356 --> 10:01.062
- Oh! Okay, Mr. Gundy...
- I think I love you.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.590
Yeah, thank you.
You need to sit down.

10:03.590 --> 10:05.242
Have a club soda.

10:05.530 --> 10:09.113
Um, um, excuse me, you dropped this.

10:09.403 --> 10:10.787
Sorry about him.

10:11.407 --> 10:13.151
Why do the jerks get all the tail?

10:13.158 --> 10:15.403
Sara Sidle, crime lab.

10:15.408 --> 10:18.211
I'm, uh, Mikey. Best man.

10:18.215 --> 10:20.011
Brother of the bride.
Yeah, it's, you know.

10:20.016 --> 10:20.700
Yeah.

10:20.708 --> 10:24.241
Hey, this is a pretty crazy-ass situation, huh?

10:24.516 --> 10:27.272
They say it's good luck if it rains on your wedding day.

10:27.277 --> 10:29.123
What do you think about a dead body?

10:29.227 --> 10:30.453
What do you think?

10:30.707 --> 10:32.362
I think my sister's better off.

10:33.268 --> 10:34.953
You ever think about getting married?

10:35.336 --> 10:38.161
I'm just saying, you know, I think Bryce could make an honest woman out of you.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.160
Oh, look at that--
your rejection broke his little heart.

10:42.278 --> 10:44.110
Should I put flirting in the case file?

10:44.306 --> 10:45.452
I was printing.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.001
He was flirting.

10:50.468 --> 10:54.082
Uni found the tracking device from Nick's car in a trash can,

10:54.088 --> 10:55.743
a couple blocks from the diner.

10:55.748 --> 10:56.831
Pro job.

10:56.836 --> 10:57.953
Has it been to Prints?

10:57.958 --> 11:01.891
Well, no. But if it was the Fatellis, it's going to be clean.

11:02.998 --> 11:08.061
Yeah. Nick's truck has no street value.
The value was what was inside.

11:21.807 --> 11:22.881
Did you get a number?

11:22.888 --> 11:27.752
No. No, I didn't get anything.
She must have put it in my pocket.

11:27.925 --> 11:28.952
Mindy.

11:30.895 --> 11:33.952
You think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.

11:38.908 --> 11:43.100
The perfume of American beauties was everywhere.

11:43.175 --> 11:45.192
Though a rose by any other name would have smelled

11:45.197 --> 11:47.700
just as sweet on a day with that much love in the air.

12:02.506 --> 12:04.903
Ladies, hi, how you doing?

12:05.257 --> 12:05.920
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:05.928 --> 12:07.161
I'm with the crime lab.

12:07.165 --> 12:10.200
My name's Nick Stokes.
I'm going to need to print you both, okay?

12:10.237 --> 12:13.221
Mindy Faberge.
Bride's side.

12:13.407 --> 12:16.301
Um, can we go in and change.

12:16.557 --> 12:17.991
I can't get warm.

12:17.995 --> 12:21.321
Cindy Jansen. I think she's still in shock.

12:21.328 --> 12:23.033
You were in the wedding party.

12:23.646 --> 12:26.223
Did you spend most of the day here with Ms. Chase?

12:26.225 --> 12:28.402
She was on her best behavior.

12:28.408 --> 12:30.162
Outside that toast she gave.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.062
- There you go.
- Thank you.

12:32.306 --> 12:35.793
Um, well, I think that was the alcohol talking.

12:35.797 --> 12:38.293
So, she was a drinker?

12:38.295 --> 12:41.541
By the end of the toast, she was slurring her words

12:41.547 --> 12:44.133
and swaying all over the place.

12:45.026 --> 12:47.880
I almost felt bad for her.

12:48.796 --> 12:51.831
Anyone interested in the wedding DVD?

12:52.195 --> 12:53.401
Yeah.

12:53.707 --> 12:58.793
Courtesy of Frank Rosetti, owner of Cupid's Kiss.

13:04.908 --> 13:06.970
All right, where do you want to start?

13:06.978 --> 13:08.180
The toast.

13:13.506 --> 13:14.612
Everyone...

13:15.906 --> 13:17.020
Everyone.

13:17.587 --> 13:20.040
I want to thank your for coming.

13:20.427 --> 13:25.333
You know, the Bible says, "Love is strong as death,"

13:25.937 --> 13:30.242
and as mother of the groom, a wedding is bittersweet.

13:30.597 --> 13:34.822
You are giving up as much as you are gaining.

13:36.015 --> 13:40.091
In some cases you are giving...

13:40.098 --> 13:42.470
Oh... up much more.

13:49.197 --> 13:50.701
To hell with it.

13:51.296 --> 13:52.741
I'll wing it.

13:56.026 --> 13:57.502
My Adam...

13:57.888 --> 13:59.892
He studied at Oxford.

13:59.898 --> 14:04.000
He went to Harvard School of Business.

14:04.007 --> 14:10.720
And of all the intelligent, wonderful, beautiful women he met along the way,

14:11.705 --> 14:13.801
he ended up with Jill.

14:15.428 --> 14:18.400
Plain, little Jill.

14:20.505 --> 14:22.551
There's nothing wrong with her.

14:22.997 --> 14:24.980
But what's right with her?

14:24.988 --> 14:27.620
I mean, even her name is boring.

14:30.306 --> 14:34.503
Adam, it's all right to take a lover.

14:34.507 --> 14:38.680
You just don't have to end up marrying her.

14:38.686 --> 14:43.290
I mean, do you really want to shallow our gene pool like this?

14:43.296 --> 14:45.303
Come on, come on.
Let's go. You got it.

14:45.305 --> 14:46.890
- Oh...
- Mom, please.

14:47.305 --> 14:50.113
Oh, I want to thank you all so much for coming.

14:50.115 --> 14:52.163
Oh, I love you, Adam.

14:52.757 --> 14:55.632
Okay, hey, good comedy, Diane...

14:55.796 --> 14:58.233
Justifiable homicide?

15:01.808 --> 15:03.531
Thank you all for coming.

15:05.245 --> 15:06.931
I love you, Adam.

15:08.126 --> 15:09.452
You talked to the bride.

15:09.458 --> 15:12.992
- This seems like motive.
- Do you think she did it?

15:13.498 --> 15:15.380
When would she have had the time?

15:17.125 --> 15:20.460
You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.

15:25.006 --> 15:29.633
Spring is but a song, where love and laughter are not wrong.

15:30.205 --> 15:36.011
The blossoms of desire do belong, and Harmonia axyridis fly along.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.140
For the past six months, she made my life hell.

15:47.635 --> 15:52.321
And so I told anyone who'd listen that she should die a fiery death.

15:53.007 --> 15:55.113
So now everyone's going to think that I killed her.

15:55.317 --> 15:57.771
Would you like to be more specific?

15:57.778 --> 16:01.103
Okay, well, when we got engaged,

16:01.107 --> 16:06.921
she ran into the backyard and she screamed, "Why, God? Why me?"

16:06.925 --> 16:08.521
Okay, she wore white today.

16:08.527 --> 16:16.613
She invited Adam's very, very attractive, very, um, single ex-girlfriends.

16:16.616 --> 16:19.603
When she found out that I had registered for sporting goods,

16:19.955 --> 16:24.581
she went behind my back and she changed the registry to housewares,

16:24.586 --> 16:27.183
saying that I'd better learn how to cook, okay?

16:27.186 --> 16:30.112
I'm a vegetarian, and she demanded roast beef.

16:30.117 --> 16:33.651
Um... Oh, and then... then there's the toast.

16:33.656 --> 16:36.372
The... the toast.

16:36.376 --> 16:39.640
Are you trying to make me think that you didn't kill her?

16:39.646 --> 16:42.041
I would never do that to Adam.

16:43.306 --> 16:49.722
I honestly don't know how such an amazing man came from-from... that.

16:50.518 --> 16:52.912
Look, it wasn't just me, okay?

16:52.916 --> 16:55.292
She fought with everyone today.

16:55.296 --> 17:01.182
She fought with the valets and the bridesmaids and the waiters.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.722
The caterer-- I thought for sure he was going to poison her.

17:04.727 --> 17:06.619
Want to see a crime scene?
I'll show you a crime scene.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.413
Come here. Come here.

17:08.416 --> 17:09.962
Look at this, huh?

17:10.686 --> 17:12.319
What this woman had against the color peach--

17:12.326 --> 17:13.482
I've never seen anything like it.

17:13.488 --> 17:16.202
"If you think you're serving that flesh-colored abomination,

17:16.204 --> 17:19.012
and I'm paying for it, you can think again!" Boom!

17:19.897 --> 17:23.392
I'm a 42-year-old paisan.
She scared me.

17:23.395 --> 17:26.423
I wouldn't be surprised if her pantyhose rebelled against her and tied themselves to the car.

17:26.428 --> 17:27.690
The dame was a pill.

17:27.694 --> 17:30.251
I swear to God, she may have taken two or three years off my own life.

17:30.255 --> 17:33.143
Weddings are a blood, sweat and tears marathon, my friend.

17:33.145 --> 17:34.623
I'm on a tight schedule.

17:34.627 --> 17:36.703
12:00 noon, I got first intro of the couple.

17:36.708 --> 17:39.503
12:30, salad course.
12:45, first dance.

17:39.507 --> 17:42.131
1:00, chair dance, chicken dance, broom dance--

17:42.138 --> 17:43.663
I don't care.
I'm equal opportunity.

17:43.665 --> 17:46.773
1:30, main course.
2:15, first toast groom's side.

17:46.778 --> 17:50.990
If the best man shuts his mouth, at 2:16 we have the first toast on the bride's side.

17:50.997 --> 17:54.203
3:00, we cut the cake.
3:30, bouquet toss.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.710
That's a tight schedule.

17:55.716 --> 17:57.860
She would have barely had time to go to the bathroom.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.322
I don't sell bridal diapers for nothing.

18:00.795 --> 18:02.990
He was kidding about the diapers, right?

18:05.505 --> 18:08.531
You're way too pretty to be a cop.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.783
I need to ask you about your brother, Dino Fatelli.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.070
Dino always was the bad seed.

18:15.075 --> 18:17.741
I heard you guys share the taste for blood.

18:18.277 --> 18:22.231
I once was lost, but now I am found.

18:23.756 --> 18:25.303
You and your brother keep in touch?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.902
Yeah, yeah.

18:27.067 --> 18:29.500
Last thing he said was he didn't like the food at Lompoc.

18:29.505 --> 18:31.240
I told him to call his lawyer.

18:32.507 --> 18:34.001
It's too late now.

18:34.005 --> 18:36.713
Where were you yesterday afternoon?

18:37.497 --> 18:40.220
You want to crawl up my ass?
You can take a number.

18:40.646 --> 18:41.613
No thanks.

18:41.946 --> 18:45.721
50-to-one, Freddie the Feddy is out there right now talking to you guys.

18:46.056 --> 18:47.452
Did you know you were made?

18:47.457 --> 18:51.463
Yeah. Not even Diane Chase could keep these guys out of jail.

18:51.708 --> 18:55.210
And we figure it's just a matter of time before we get something on Sylvano.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.972
Like another murder?

18:59.628 --> 19:00.580
Sorry.

19:00.586 --> 19:02.383
He didn't kill the lawyer.

19:02.566 --> 19:04.903
Runs numbers out of his bar all day.

19:04.906 --> 19:06.561
Trying to pass a kidney stone.

19:06.568 --> 19:08.540
Hates his wife and his girlfriend.

19:08.546 --> 19:09.930
I hear everything.

19:10.577 --> 19:12.863
Could order one of his guys to do it.

19:13.007 --> 19:15.010
The brothers like to be hands-on.

19:15.406 --> 19:19.643
And all we're hearing is them bitching about how somebody snatched their M.O...

19:20.476 --> 19:22.271
as if it's copyrighted.

19:22.405 --> 19:25.941
Based on my dissection, I've detected two separate events.

19:26.706 --> 19:29.791
I believe that this puncture wound happened first.

19:29.797 --> 19:34.253
The object lacerated a cerebral artery creating a subdural hematoma.

19:34.256 --> 19:38.021
Then subsequent blows to her skull, from a ride behind the car,

19:38.026 --> 19:41.552
created additional fractures which caused diffuse bleeding on the brain,

19:41.556 --> 19:43.180
resulting in her death.

19:43.188 --> 19:46.040
- So punctured and bobbled?
- Yeah.

19:46.048 --> 19:49.200
I autopsied the Fatellis' original victim.

19:49.205 --> 19:50.692
They're sadists.

19:50.697 --> 19:54.443
First Remy James is dragged behind the Cadillac, and when he wouldn't talk,

19:54.447 --> 19:55.883
they shot him in every joint.

19:55.887 --> 19:57.540
And when he still wouldn't talk,

19:57.546 --> 20:00.232
they finished him off with a shot to the head.

20:00.238 --> 20:03.271
The Fatellis don't mostly kill someone.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.632
So you took the perimeter of the scene, right?

20:05.636 --> 20:06.350
Yeah.

20:06.668 --> 20:08.710
Well, I saw this guy in the shadows.

20:08.717 --> 20:10.012
Archie blew it up.

20:10.015 --> 20:12.193
He looks more like a suspect than a guest.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.212
That face look familiar?

20:18.446 --> 20:19.362
Oh, yeah.

20:19.365 --> 20:22.252
Yeah, I caught that guy trying to sleep one off in the bushes.

20:23.176 --> 20:24.750
That's the groom's old man.

20:27.006 --> 20:28.922
Wow, I thought my wedding was bad.

20:29.397 --> 20:30.141
Where is he?

20:30.145 --> 20:33.072
I sent him to detox, in the tank.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.742
See, that's the problem with being a deadbeat dad.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.630
If you're not around for the bad times,

20:38.636 --> 20:40.163
they don't want you around for the good times.

20:40.168 --> 20:42.360
I didn't... I'm not...

20:42.957 --> 20:46.552
Let's just cut right through the lie-and-deny part of the chat,

20:46.557 --> 20:48.463
and I'll tell you what I know.

20:48.808 --> 20:51.311
My mother was a powerful woman;
she had a lot of enemies.

20:51.578 --> 20:54.862
My mother and Jill worked so hard to make this day perfect.

20:55.366 --> 20:56.860
It seems silly now.

20:57.008 --> 20:59.190
They had a fight about the gifts, then...

20:59.605 --> 21:01.933
then there was a disagreement with the bridesmaids.

21:01.935 --> 21:03.683
And my mother accidentally brought the wrong dress.

21:03.688 --> 21:07.510
Then the dinner was wrong, and the cake was wrong.

21:08.277 --> 21:10.833
And my father showed up.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.893
- What, he wasn't invited?
- Um, no.

21:13.895 --> 21:15.410
My parents are divorced.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.212
I think that's why today was so hard on her.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.751
The wedding brought up a lot of issues for her.

21:20.756 --> 21:23.350
She sacrificed so much for me.

21:23.667 --> 21:25.512
Single parent, grad school.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.562
She was a champion.

21:28.746 --> 21:32.300
My father is... unstable.

21:33.257 --> 21:35.621
For years, he's had a drug problem.

21:35.705 --> 21:37.013
She told him that.

21:37.308 --> 21:39.101
I don't believe that bitch!

21:39.408 --> 21:42.021
You do or you don't have a drug problem? Which is it?

21:42.028 --> 21:44.730
Don't take everything you see at face value.

21:48.406 --> 21:54.221
15 years ago, Diane decided she wanted to go back to work.

21:54.907 --> 21:56.653
And I encouraged her.

21:57.137 --> 22:02.052
But then she became... driven.

22:02.578 --> 22:04.363
And I was slowing her down.

22:04.526 --> 22:06.250
She got nasty.

22:06.446 --> 22:08.080
I got depressed.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.792
I started taking antidepressants.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.623
She was mortified.

22:12.907 --> 22:14.401
Said it wouldn't look good.

22:14.405 --> 22:17.633
I said, "Hey, I'm not one of your clients.
I'm your husband."

22:18.076 --> 22:20.893
"Not anymore," she said.

22:22.187 --> 22:23.910
She filed for divorce.

22:24.806 --> 22:28.950
And she said it was because the drugs affected my libido.

22:29.806 --> 22:36.022
We hadn't had sex for eight months before I started taking the drugs.

22:36.127 --> 22:38.682
Did you have an altercation with her at the wedding?

22:38.686 --> 22:41.541
Yeah. Yeah.

22:43.427 --> 22:46.181
Because of the meds, I don't drink very much.

22:47.807 --> 22:51.071
I did today because I thought it would take the edge off.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.253
It put the edge on.

22:57.247 --> 22:58.641
Good to see you.

22:58.908 --> 23:01.161
Hi. How are you?

23:01.167 --> 23:02.152
It's great...

23:02.157 --> 23:03.552
Excuse me.

23:05.907 --> 23:07.780
You were not invited.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.962
I read the papers, Diane.

23:09.967 --> 23:11.820
They teach literacy at the halfway house?

23:11.826 --> 23:13.822
I didn't come here to fight.

23:13.828 --> 23:16.910
- You're not here at all.
- He's my son, too.

23:17.465 --> 23:19.411
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

23:20.007 --> 23:23.021
I stuck around to see the ceremony.

23:23.025 --> 23:25.191
I even saw a little bit of the reception.

23:25.305 --> 23:27.923
I was sleeping it off when your guys found me.

23:28.696 --> 23:29.940
So you didn't kill her?

23:29.948 --> 23:34.300
No. But you better check to see if she's really dead,

23:35.075 --> 23:37.462
because I don't think you can kill the devil.

23:39.507 --> 23:41.890
Nick, you drew Mr. Chase's blood at the scene.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.510
His BAC was .28.

23:43.517 --> 23:44.943
That was at 4:00 p.m.

23:44.947 --> 23:49.122
And officers drew it again at the station an hour later. It was .22.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.742
So he was in the elimination phase.

23:50.877 --> 23:53.173
That means, when the victim was tied to the car,

23:53.176 --> 23:55.510
his blood alcohol level was even higher.

23:55.637 --> 23:57.283
Mr. Chase was blotto.

23:57.285 --> 23:58.773
He couldn't have tied his own shoes.

23:58.776 --> 24:02.011
Assuming whoever took your truck is the killer,

24:02.235 --> 24:05.093
Mr. Chase was in the tank.
He couldn't have done it.

24:05.516 --> 24:06.722
One suspect down.

24:06.948 --> 24:10.610
Speaking of downers, Ms. Chase liked her Diazepam.

24:10.618 --> 24:13.760
Blood levels were somewhere between therapeutic and toxic.

24:13.767 --> 24:15.153
That's... that's weird.

24:15.158 --> 24:19.223
Her ex-husband told Brass she was very anti-psychopharmaceuticals.

24:19.226 --> 24:23.341
As a toxicology tech, I'd say often those who adamantly oppose the D-train

24:23.346 --> 24:25.300
are its most frequent passengers.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.813
But, since she is deceased, I was able to get her medical records.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.173
No Diazepam scrip.

24:30.176 --> 24:32.873
So she got daffy on someone else's pills.

24:33.778 --> 24:36.433
That explains Mindy's account of her behavior.

24:36.586 --> 24:37.882
And the toast.

24:38.565 --> 24:41.970
Doesn't explain how she was conked out, tied to a bumper.

24:43.238 --> 24:44.982
I might know what happened.

24:45.398 --> 24:48.670
You'd think she'd know better than to wear white on the bride's big day.

24:51.785 --> 24:54.812
A dame was dead, but enough about her.

24:54.816 --> 24:58.670
The air was hot and heavy with wrong, making me thirsty.

24:58.678 --> 25:01.423
Thirsty for a tall drink of water.

25:01.428 --> 25:04.003
That's when I saw her-- a flower--

25:04.006 --> 25:06.241
but not the kind you pin on a lapel.

25:06.247 --> 25:08.363
She was long-stemmed.

25:08.408 --> 25:11.060
All right, Raymond Chandler, we get it.

25:14.827 --> 25:16.711
And those weren't just Miracle Bras.

25:16.717 --> 25:19.393
They were creating four Wonders of the World.

25:19.397 --> 25:21.702
I'm Greg Sanders, with the crime lab.

25:23.108 --> 25:24.662
I need to take your prints.

25:27.506 --> 25:29.700
That's quite a case you got there.
Is that your magic kit?

25:29.706 --> 25:31.181
Or your toy box?

25:31.376 --> 25:33.711
You don't seem to be very upset about what happened.

25:33.715 --> 25:37.661
Sweetheart, I've had so many martinis,
I'm both shaken and stirred.

25:37.668 --> 25:38.931
Numbing the pain?

25:38.936 --> 25:41.723
Look, we're not going to pretend
to be all liquid and soft, okay?

25:41.727 --> 25:44.080
All that's missing here are the striped socks.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.910
- Ding, dong, the witch is dead.
- So you're not a fan?

25:47.438 --> 25:49.610
Cruella made me wear underwear today.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.433
No one makes me wear underwear.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.690
I'll do you if you do me.

25:57.257 --> 25:58.362
They did not.

25:58.658 --> 26:01.961
So how does that help explain how Diane Chase died?

26:01.966 --> 26:03.281
I'm getting there.

26:03.807 --> 26:05.813
Okay, ladies, let's slow it down.

26:06.808 --> 26:08.662
When was the last time you saw Diane?

26:08.668 --> 26:10.331
In the hospitality suite.

26:10.465 --> 26:12.812
I came in to fix my hair.
She was complaining of a headache.

26:12.817 --> 26:15.663
Next time I saw her, it was bottoms up, Mommie Dearest.

26:21.827 --> 26:26.703
So I headed behind the pink curtain, where the girls go to get glossy.

26:40.408 --> 26:43.620
A little shine here, a little proof there.

26:44.738 --> 26:45.723
A little...

26:47.907 --> 26:52.513
Well, I don't know exactly what that was, but I liked the feel.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.982
Marriage was looking like a lucrative endeavor.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.471
And that's when I saw it.

27:11.935 --> 27:13.370
Just a few drops.

27:13.587 --> 27:16.223
I thought the blood could have been incidental--

27:16.606 --> 27:19.743
nosebleed, shaving accident.

27:28.225 --> 27:31.860
But, what if, high as a kite on a slipped Mickey,

27:31.865 --> 27:36.533
she slips-- and bam!-- straight to the back of the skull?

27:36.806 --> 27:39.203
The arrow was four-sided.

27:39.207 --> 27:41.413
It would leave a diamond-shaped wound.

27:43.498 --> 27:44.620
They match.

27:46.448 --> 27:50.071
If the initial wound was accidental,

27:50.075 --> 27:52.322
why was she panty-hosed to the back of a car?

27:52.328 --> 27:53.491
Don't know yet.

27:53.865 --> 27:57.333
Narrows the field of suspects down to someone who had access to that suite.

27:57.687 --> 27:58.950
Where's the statue?

27:59.187 --> 28:00.190
In your car.

28:00.505 --> 28:01.360
Ah!

28:09.508 --> 28:13.393
I know every piece of evidence regarding this case is precious, given the circumstances,

28:13.396 --> 28:17.421
so I just wanted to let you know that I've moved Ms. Chase's fingernail scrapings

28:17.426 --> 28:19.423
to the top of my extensive queue.

28:19.427 --> 28:22.773
Composite substance.
You're never going to believe this.

28:22.778 --> 28:26.660
Egg whites, sugar, butter, milk, food coloring.

28:27.385 --> 28:28.343
How did you know?

28:28.546 --> 28:31.892
Butter cream frosting.
She had an incident with a wedding cake.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.351
Are you done?

28:37.358 --> 28:40.931
You know, you and me, we're not the marrying kind.

28:41.478 --> 28:45.292
The intricacies of our nature can never be understood by just one woman.

28:46.156 --> 28:48.090
Would you close the door, please?

28:55.357 --> 28:56.801
From the other side.

29:07.208 --> 29:10.343
Sara? Sara?

29:11.035 --> 29:12.272
IAB here?

29:12.586 --> 29:14.871
No. They're still held up with that officer-involved shooting,

29:14.878 --> 29:17.241
but the Bomb Squad has cleared the convertible.

29:17.406 --> 29:19.540
Oh. Finally.

29:19.797 --> 29:21.521
Something to process.

29:25.227 --> 29:27.670
I thought you said the snowboards were in the suite.

29:27.677 --> 29:28.841
I did.

29:28.846 --> 29:31.171
Then what's the case doing in the trunk?

29:46.905 --> 29:50.583
So you asked me to follow her comings and goings and her food and drink intake.

29:50.885 --> 29:54.070
As far as I can tell, she didn't touch her soup or salad.

29:54.566 --> 29:55.870
And the main course?

30:03.355 --> 30:05.011
And what did Diane have to drink?

30:05.016 --> 30:10.970
Um... I only saw her with two glasses, both champagne, first one around 2:00.

30:11.608 --> 30:14.102
But maybe she was hitting the bar, because look:

30:14.987 --> 30:16.812
This is 15 minutes later.

30:18.405 --> 30:19.740
Oh, my.

30:20.205 --> 30:25.121
The waiter gave her a second glass for her toast, which I watched five times.

30:25.956 --> 30:27.331
And that was it.

30:27.335 --> 30:29.310
When was the last time she was on camera?

30:29.318 --> 30:34.902
Well, her exit was neither polite nor discreet.

30:34.955 --> 30:39.272
I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck,

30:39.278 --> 30:41.821
and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.

30:42.536 --> 30:45.472
And these two... uh... there's more.

30:45.475 --> 30:50.142
Uh... I think these guys are in it for the long haul.

30:50.905 --> 30:54.151
- Making friends over here.
- No, but seriously, uh...

30:54.825 --> 30:57.050
I don't mean to get all sentimental or anything,

30:57.057 --> 30:59.590
but these two are going to have a lot of sex tonight.

30:59.657 --> 31:02.543
And.. what?
What? Are you embarrassed?

31:02.547 --> 31:05.841
She's embarrassed. I'm her older brother.
I changed her diapers.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.812
That was 2:25.

31:07.815 --> 31:09.802
Would you play that again?

31:12.307 --> 31:16.740
I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck,

31:16.745 --> 31:19.291
and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.

31:24.846 --> 31:28.101
Yeah, Jim. Check into a Mikey Shoemaker, the bride's brother.

31:28.105 --> 31:29.870
Run his wants and warrants.

31:29.877 --> 31:32.323
And also look into the location of his tow yard.

31:32.328 --> 31:33.631
Thank you.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.493
- So?
- I need your hands.

31:46.507 --> 31:47.791
I thought you'd never ask.

31:47.798 --> 31:51.942
I need you to reprint the bumper because the tape lifts were stolen.

31:51.945 --> 31:53.783
Anything to keep me awake.

31:59.706 --> 32:03.970
Uh-oh! Looks like we had some bride's little helper going on.

32:03.975 --> 32:05.412
Diazepam.

32:05.417 --> 32:10.661
Just filled. Rx calls for six ten-milligram pills.

32:10.985 --> 32:12.300
Two left.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.773
40 milligrams would match mom's blood level.

32:15.448 --> 32:17.970
Jill gets some pills to calm herself,

32:17.977 --> 32:20.302
decides to calm her mother-in-law instead,

32:20.307 --> 32:22.372
and make everybody happy.

32:22.375 --> 32:26.102
Okay, the blood from the snowboard bag was a match to Mother Chase.

32:26.875 --> 32:30.140
That could have been what they used to transport her from point A to point B.

32:30.147 --> 32:33.602
Yeah, "they" is right, 'cause I also found two female epithelial contributions.

32:33.605 --> 32:36.252
One on each handle of the bag, and then one of the same females

32:36.255 --> 32:39.031
was also a match to the DNA from the knot in the pantyhose.

32:39.036 --> 32:41.960
We could compare them to the buccal swabs we collected...

32:41.967 --> 32:43.610
if we still had them.

32:43.635 --> 32:46.062
Well, we'll just have to recollect them.

32:46.067 --> 32:47.400
All 200 of them?

32:47.407 --> 32:51.802
Yeah, and since we can't leave, someone else is gonna have to recollect them.

32:51.817 --> 32:53.022
This is crap!

32:53.457 --> 32:56.882
I've been waiting on I.A.B. for... 14 hours.

32:57.005 --> 33:02.551
I'm tired... and I kind of smell, and I don't have a freakin' car.

33:07.547 --> 33:08.693
Hey, buddy.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.462
Hey.

33:10.468 --> 33:11.643
How you doing?

33:12.035 --> 33:13.742
- You all right?
- Hey, this, this sucks, man.

33:13.746 --> 33:16.920
I didn't do anything wrong, and everybody's looking at me like I'm the bad guy.

33:17.005 --> 33:19.751
If I had to do it all over again,
I'd do the exact same thing.

33:19.755 --> 33:22.721
- Nick, Nick...
- I mean, how do I fix the situation?

33:22.726 --> 33:25.283
It was already screwed up to begin with. What?

33:33.707 --> 33:36.050
I loaned one of the bridesmaids my jacket.

33:36.635 --> 33:40.373
She was wearing black.
There was no reason to ALS.

33:41.706 --> 33:47.301
Blood must have transferred from her to my jacket, to me.

33:47.666 --> 33:50.532
I didn't want to contaminate it by pulling it over my head, you know?

33:50.537 --> 33:52.093
That was good thinking.

33:57.305 --> 33:59.043
All right. Hey, Wendy,

33:59.045 --> 33:59.503
Uh-huh?

33:59.507 --> 34:02.290
I don't know if you'll be able to get anything off of this, but

34:02.298 --> 34:06.203
I want you to compare the female epithelials you found on the snowboard bag

34:06.206 --> 34:09.550
against the napkin that I have in my right front pocket.

34:10.498 --> 34:11.632
Come on.

34:24.368 --> 34:27.020
So that was a good call on the bride's brother, Mikey Shoemaker.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.192
He had a prior conviction for car theft.

34:29.565 --> 34:31.183
Where did you find Nick's truck?

34:31.187 --> 34:35.732
In one of the paint bays of his auto body shop, right next to a delivery truck.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.380
We're looking for Mikey now.

34:37.388 --> 34:39.489
Well, I watched the rest of the wedding video.

34:39.495 --> 34:44.842
He may have stolen the car, but once Diane disappears, Mikey never leaves the party.

34:44.846 --> 34:46.232
Maybe he wasn't acting alone.

34:46.235 --> 34:47.350
Hey, Pip.

34:47.685 --> 34:49.150
How you like your new ride?

34:52.357 --> 34:54.442
Hey, look.
They fixed it.

34:55.056 --> 34:58.562
- Oh, that's not funny.
- Oh, it's a little funny.

35:15.435 --> 35:16.732
Where did you get that?

35:16.735 --> 35:20.052
Unis found it in a dumpster behind Mikey Shoemaker's body shop.

35:20.058 --> 35:22.240
He went through all that trouble to steal the car

35:22.245 --> 35:23.840
and that's where he ditches it?

35:23.847 --> 35:26.022
Well, they didn't find any biological evidence,

35:26.025 --> 35:28.442
and he probably hocked the cameras, but

35:28.446 --> 35:30.711
at least I've been reunited with love's deadly arrow.

35:30.715 --> 35:33.582
You know that's not going to stand up in court, right?

35:33.586 --> 35:38.063
Well, Negative Nelly, I know that, and you know that, but the suspects might not.

35:38.068 --> 35:40.550
We have to convince them that we know what happened.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.013
- Do we?
- We're close.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.831
Can you put the U.V. filter on the camera?

35:43.836 --> 35:44.603
Sure.

36:00.705 --> 36:03.421
- How did you...?
- I didn't, until I processed it.

36:03.426 --> 36:06.632
But I was thinking the statue punctured her in the back of the head,

36:06.635 --> 36:09.050
which means one of three things might have happened.

36:09.058 --> 36:13.193
- Either she was stabbed by it...
- Well, the statue looks a little unwieldy.

36:13.195 --> 36:15.821
Or she accidentally fell on it.

36:15.828 --> 36:19.612
But with no one to blame, why wouldn't someone just call 911?

36:19.615 --> 36:22.280
Which leaves us with option number three:

36:23.817 --> 36:25.183
she was pushed.

36:28.006 --> 36:30.592
Lucky for us someone had something on their hands.

36:30.597 --> 36:34.261
- Something that left good ridge detail.
- I'll swab it for trace.

36:34.407 --> 36:36.980
Prints are a match to a bridesmaid, Lacey Finn.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.181
She's in the system?

36:38.188 --> 36:40.932
Yeah, she was a cocktail waitress for a short time.

36:41.318 --> 36:42.742
Of course she was.

36:42.745 --> 36:45.452
And I pulled the prints off of this pill bottle, but I didn't find a match.

36:45.457 --> 36:48.011
Which means the bride didn't do it because as a nurse,

36:48.017 --> 36:49.941
- she'd also be in the system.
- Correct.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.870
However, I did find something.

36:52.126 --> 36:54.333
Look at the prescribing doctor on that label.

36:54.338 --> 36:58.342
I was cross-checking with the guest list, and guess who the good doctor's wife is.

36:59.758 --> 37:02.513
- Mrs. Valerie Whitehall.
- She's also a bridesmaid.

37:04.947 --> 37:08.602
Well, she knew where the pills were.
She had access to the suite,

37:09.015 --> 37:12.482
so maybe Jill didn't poison mom, Valerie did.

37:12.488 --> 37:14.230
A little bonus in the bubbly.

37:14.237 --> 37:16.962
I got the results from Mama Chase's suit jacket.

37:16.967 --> 37:18.072
What's the trace?

37:18.317 --> 37:19.391
Hair gel.

37:23.095 --> 37:25.553
Lacey said that she went to fix her hair.

37:28.365 --> 37:30.171
Where's that Sara chick?

37:32.107 --> 37:34.852
Oh, Romeo, I don't think that you have time for romance.

37:34.858 --> 37:37.010
You're being charged with grand theft auto,

37:37.017 --> 37:40.360
obstruction of justice and conspiracy to murder.

37:41.575 --> 37:44.140
Okay, I will cop to everything but the murder.

37:44.147 --> 37:47.601
Well, if you didn't commit the murder, why did you steal the car?

37:48.838 --> 37:50.660
Look, the lady was already dead, all right?

37:50.666 --> 37:54.052
And then, then you guys show up and this bridesmaid comes up to me

37:54.056 --> 37:56.340
and starts asking me all these questions about my tow truck.

37:56.345 --> 37:57.623
Which bridesmaid?

37:57.625 --> 37:58.961
The hot one.

37:59.417 --> 38:02.283
Next thing I know, she wants to be the Bonnie to my Clyde.

38:02.286 --> 38:05.322
Asked me to steal this car and trash all the evidence.

38:05.528 --> 38:08.642
So you committed grand theft auto to get laid?

38:10.707 --> 38:13.150
Ever stolen a two-ton piece of machinery?

38:13.746 --> 38:16.102
It is way better than sex.

38:16.235 --> 38:18.651
And finding a girl that doesn't want to kick you to the curb for it?

38:18.658 --> 38:20.560
I mean, come on.
That is just hot.

38:22.208 --> 38:25.073
Besides, I hadn't gotten a wedding gift for my sister yet.

38:25.468 --> 38:28.560
So I don't have a match to one of the handles to the snowboard case,

38:28.567 --> 38:32.233
- but, um, your napkin girl...
- That Mindy Faberge?

38:32.308 --> 38:34.201
- She got to be a bridesmaid.
- Yeah.

38:34.408 --> 38:36.660
She matches the other handle.

38:37.405 --> 38:41.131
Well, she was in the suite with the gifts.
She could have touched it then.

38:43.008 --> 38:44.440
You paged?

38:44.446 --> 38:48.461
We think that each of the bridesmaids is responsible for killing her.

38:48.465 --> 38:52.601
Not individually, but working in cahoots.

38:52.606 --> 38:54.201
Each one played their part.

38:54.205 --> 38:57.633
Did you know the original role of the bridesmaid

38:57.827 --> 39:01.313
was to act as a human shield against the bride's enemies?

39:01.315 --> 39:05.032
Women would dress similar to the bride in an effort to confuse

39:05.037 --> 39:08.571
and outsmart evil spirits that might try to overtake her on her wedding day.

39:08.575 --> 39:12.401
Wow, for somebody who's anti-wedding,
you certainly know a lot about it.

39:12.405 --> 39:15.270
I'm not anti-wedding. I'm just anti-stupid--

39:15.276 --> 39:19.561
you know, people who do things for the sake of tradition with no clue as to why.

39:19.746 --> 39:23.990
Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?

39:26.207 --> 39:29.281
Valerie kindly gets mom a drink.

39:37.366 --> 39:41.070
Then during her toast, Diane starts to feel the effects.

39:43.426 --> 39:47.473
By Mikey's toast, she decides that she's toast.

39:47.478 --> 39:49.503
...a little something about getting hitched.

39:51.705 --> 39:53.973
I know what you did.

39:54.725 --> 39:58.453
I'm going to have your husband's medical license,

39:58.776 --> 40:01.931
and I'm going to have you put away for attempted murder.

40:01.936 --> 40:09.621
Lacey overhears Diane's paranoid yet correct ramblings and eventually follows her out.

40:15.408 --> 40:16.470
You okay?

40:16.475 --> 40:20.512
The gall of you to ask me that!
You know I'm not okay, you little tart.

40:20.928 --> 40:23.380
- You're all just as bad as she is.
- Don't get mad.

40:23.387 --> 40:25.330
Valerie was just trying to make you feel better.

40:25.336 --> 40:28.882
Oh, by giving me a controlled substance?

40:28.888 --> 40:32.323
You are going down for conspiracy!

40:33.605 --> 40:34.521
All right!

40:34.525 --> 40:36.552
You know what, lady?!

40:36.555 --> 40:37.833
That's enough!

40:39.308 --> 40:43.730
Leaving her incapacitated but not dead.

40:46.128 --> 40:50.220
At which point Lacey tells Mindy and Cindy.

40:51.228 --> 40:53.283
They formulate a plan.

40:54.056 --> 40:55.471
Oh, God!

40:55.606 --> 40:57.633
Once we get her in there, what are we going to do with her?

40:57.637 --> 41:01.641
Oh, um, let's make it look like it was, um, Forelli...

41:01.967 --> 41:03.722
- Fratelli brothers?
- Fratelli brothers.

41:03.728 --> 41:07.211
- We'll just make it look like they did it.
- Oh, my God.

41:13.708 --> 41:19.600
They tie her to the car, chuck the bag in the trunk, return to the party.

41:25.296 --> 41:27.462
Got it, yes!

41:28.998 --> 41:34.591
And everyone just continues along with the joyous festivities until...

41:41.645 --> 41:46.873
I'm not a bad person, and we didn't exactly kill her.

41:46.877 --> 41:51.983
I mean, I like to think she killed herself because she was crazy.

41:52.245 --> 41:54.861
She did crazy things to our friend.

41:54.868 --> 41:58.312
I mean, who hates a pediatric nurse?

41:58.476 --> 42:03.520
Granted, we'd all been drinking, but she drove us to it.

42:03.526 --> 42:05.511
We did what we had to do.

42:05.516 --> 42:08.941
Sisterhood is powerful this and powerful that.

42:08.947 --> 42:10.682
She was on a total trip.

42:11.136 --> 42:14.193
There was no way Jill could endure a life of that.

42:14.746 --> 42:20.400
I just... I wanted to shut her up with the drugs, but that backfired...

42:20.998 --> 42:21.700
leaving us...

42:21.705 --> 42:23.821
...no choice.
She was coming at me.

42:23.827 --> 42:26.740
I just, I just defended myself.

42:26.747 --> 42:31.522
I didn't mean to take her down, but once she was, I...

42:32.216 --> 42:34.152
I felt nothing.

42:34.565 --> 42:40.013
There she was just, just staring at me, and all I could think was...

42:41.278 --> 42:42.652
"Thank God."

42:54.586 --> 42:55.520
Grissom?

42:58.317 --> 42:59.813
I.A.B. is here.

43:01.058 --> 43:02.143
Lovely.

43:02.935 --> 43:05.322
You should know that while waiting for I.A.B.,

43:05.327 --> 43:07.581
we recovered the car and solved the case.

43:07.588 --> 43:10.461
Well, this is not a "No harm, no foul" situation.

43:11.565 --> 43:13.870
Disciplinary action may still be taken.

43:14.437 --> 43:15.511
Okay.

43:18.377 --> 43:20.013
So who wants to go first?

43:23.456 --> 43:24.840
I don't think it matters.

43:25.406 --> 43:28.252
I'm sure our stories are all the same.
