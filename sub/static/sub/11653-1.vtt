01:57.994 --> 01:59.454
Once again,

01:59.537 --> 02:05.126
I am free to smite the world
as I did in days long past.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.671
MAN: When the evil,
shape-shifting wizard Aku

02:08.755 --> 02:11.841
arose from the bowels of hate
to ravage our homeland,

02:12.383 --> 02:14.677
I was a young emperor at the time

02:14.886 --> 02:17.388
and was helpless against his powers.

02:17.597 --> 02:21.309
But I remembered
our grandfather's grandfather's story

02:21.392 --> 02:24.979
of three monks
who were gifted with mystical powers.

02:25.438 --> 02:28.399
I rode to the highest peak
of the mountainside,

02:28.483 --> 02:34.947
where the monks agreed to forge me
an enchanted sword with great magic.

02:35.031 --> 02:38.117
Armed with the sword
and the hope of my people,

02:38.242 --> 02:40.995
I plunged into battle against Aku.

02:41.079 --> 02:45.208
His evil was no match
for the power of righteousness.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.876
And with the sword's magic,

02:46.959 --> 02:50.588
Aku's demon forces
were implanted into the earth,

02:50.672 --> 02:55.385
forever petrifying him into the wasteland
that he created.

03:00.723 --> 03:05.812
Through years of hard work,
we have rebuilt our glorious past

03:06.104 --> 03:10.441
with hopes never to encounter
such an evil as Aku again.

03:10.817 --> 03:12.902
(DOG BARKING)

03:15.697 --> 03:17.824
Always be alert, my son,

03:18.199 --> 03:22.495
for the presence of evil
is sometimes right behind you.

My...son.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.764
What has happened to our land, Father?

16:54.348 --> 16:58.602
My son, it has been many years
since that fateful day

16:58.685 --> 17:01.146
that Aku returned from his imprisonment.

17:04.399 --> 17:08.904
Enslaved we have become,
to unearth the riches of our land

17:09.029 --> 17:11.698

17:26.922 --> 17:30.050

from which he came.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.137
No!

17:39.226 --> 17:40.811
I thought once like you.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.437
But the sword is only a tool.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.233
What power has it
compared to the hand that wields it?

17:46.608 --> 17:51.280
Evil is clever,
and deception is its most powerful weapon.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.032

With the blessings of righteousness

22:09.955 --> 22:12.123
and the power of the sacred blade,
