00:04.360 --> 00:05.200
BILKEY: I am gay.

00:05.320 --> 00:06.240
I'm missing something here.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.120
Bilkey's a homo.

00:07.240 --> 00:09.400
You should adopt Sparky!

00:09.520 --> 00:11.680
Phineas, I want
you to meet our son.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.520
WOLF: I love her, Mom, andshe's not going anywhere.

00:13.640 --> 00:16.400
So I guess you're one
of us now, Slutty Pants.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.440
Don't call me slutty pants.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.680
I know where you and
I could find 60,000--

00:21.800 --> 00:23.440
100,000 on a good day.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.320
Money machines.

00:24.440 --> 00:25.320
Fuck the money machines.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.800
ALL: Fuck the money machines.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.440
An automatic teller machine.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.920
A bank in a wall?

00:34.040 --> 00:34.920
Look.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.760
The ATM doesn't matter, Phineas.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.280
We're trying to steal
the money before it

00:38.400 --> 00:39.560
gets in there, remember?

00:39.680 --> 00:40.960
PHINEAS: From the van
carrying the money

00:41.080 --> 00:42.120
to the bank in a wall?

00:42.240 --> 00:43.640
TED: Yes.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.600
Three of these newfangledmachines around Auckland.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.600
Every day, they're
reloaded with cash.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.280
BERT: Yep, same van,
same route, every day.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.000
MAN 1: So we jump the
guard, steal the van,

00:51.120 --> 00:52.080
Bob's your uncle.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.080
TED: Ah, we can't do that.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.480
MAN 2: Big brother is watching.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.840
The whole alleyway around wherethe van pulls up is covered.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.280
MAN 3: But we're in balaclavas.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.640
TED: The cameras are monitored.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.920
MAN 1: And we know this how?

01:02.040 --> 01:03.640
My cousin helped
install the machines.

01:03.760 --> 01:04.600
Again, so?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.240
30 seconds and we're gone.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.160
Yeah, and they're reachingfor the phone calling the pigs.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.400
Meanwhile, we're driving
around out in the open.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.040
The getaway strategy
doesn't work.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.000
So let's take them
out then-- the cameras.

01:14.120 --> 01:15.560
And how are you
going to do that?

01:15.680 --> 01:17.480
I'll shoot them
out with my rifle.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.560
And they're not
going to notice

01:18.680 --> 01:19.560
that the cameras are down?

01:19.680 --> 01:21.200
Maybe tell the van not to stop?

01:21.320 --> 01:23.120
Well, I'm not hearing anyoneelse making any suggestions.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.400
No guns, Lefty.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.240
Yeah, that didn't
end so well last time.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.040
[gunshot]

01:32.480 --> 01:33.640
With what last time?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.840
Nothing, Darijo.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.440
So are we going to do
this fucking job or not?

01:37.560 --> 01:38.440
Yes, yes.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.720
We just need to think some more.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.800
That's all.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.640
Unless I bring giant
demolition machine.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.280
We smash ATM right out ofthe wall, put it on truck,

01:49.400 --> 01:52.680
bring it home with us.

01:52.800 --> 01:53.800
Maybe we'll sleep on that.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.040
RITA: Is something wrong
with the meat loaf?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.080
No, it's delicious, love.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.960
How's things around here?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.120
Great.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.600
Are you and
Cheryl playing nice?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.320
We have an understanding.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.280
That machine can be a bitrough on your delicates,

02:28.400 --> 02:29.200
just so you know.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.720
All good.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.120
I think it's fair to saythat we're in the process

02:33.240 --> 02:34.160
of sorting things out.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.800
Ah, what a shame.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.800
But I did warn you.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.560
Yes, you did.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.120
The machine's free
now if you want it.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.040
RITA: Great!

02:46.160 --> 02:46.920
Thank you, Cheryl.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.400
No worries, Rita.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.480
Fuck!

02:57.600 --> 02:58.400
Ugh.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.760
Oh, gee, first the washingmachine, now the oven.

03:04.880 --> 03:09.480
It's really not a goodday for appliances, is it?

03:09.600 --> 03:13.600
Meanwhile, back to whateverbug's crawled up your jacksie.

03:13.720 --> 03:15.280
Bloody money machine job.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.400
I thought you
were all over it.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.880
Yeah, so did I.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.240
There's cameras
everywhere watching us.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.080
It's getting to
be like that book.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.800
You know the one Wolf wasmeant to read for school

03:24.920 --> 03:26.320
and I ended up reading?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
"1984"?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.440
It's only two
years away, Rita.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.760
The rate we're going,
it's going to be true.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.120
I mean, in America,you've got Reagan, right?

03:34.240 --> 03:37.040
B movie actor with hisfinger on the nuclear button.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.000
How can the world be anymore messed up than that?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.400
[music playing]

03:41.520 --> 03:42.280
Hey!

03:42.400 --> 03:43.480
Fuckballs!

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200
You have to stop
trying to get me naked.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.680
But naked is where youdo some of your best work.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.840
But it's not going to getme my master's, though, is it?

03:49.960 --> 03:52.760
[giggling]

03:55.320 --> 03:56.800
It's just one of
those jobs, you know?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.640
I mean, it's a greatidea until you look at it

03:58.760 --> 04:00.400
and the problems keep piling up.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.800
Then don't do it.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.880
Oh, that's not my
call, [inaudible]..

04:04.000 --> 04:05.040
You know that.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.360
You need to let
your voice be heard.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.240
Yeah, yeah.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.160
I know.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.680
I'm serious.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.400
Those guys need to appreciateyou more than they do.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.640
The boys?

04:12.760 --> 04:14.880
They're all right.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.760
No, they aren't.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.200
They don't listen to you.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.560
And they treat you like--

04:21.680 --> 04:22.480
Like what?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.560
Like you're the little naughtyboy who does what he's told.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.040
Sorry.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.240
For what?

04:36.360 --> 04:38.480
Being the one
who tells you that.

04:38.600 --> 04:41.040
Nah, it's cool.

04:41.160 --> 04:44.240
It'll change one day.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.200
I'll be like The
Incredible Hulk--

04:46.320 --> 04:49.560
all real nice and stuff untilone day I get pushed too far.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.480
And then I'll be like--

04:50.600 --> 04:52.800
[inhales] [roars]

04:52.920 --> 04:55.840
[laughs] No, I'm notfalling for your cheap moves.

04:55.960 --> 04:56.720
Cheap?

04:56.840 --> 04:59.920
My moves are all class.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.800
Three things are
going to happen.

05:02.920 --> 05:06.280
I'm getting a seven-to-eight,then you're leaving,

05:06.400 --> 05:07.640
then I'm getting back to work.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.160
Scrambled eggs OK?

05:39.280 --> 05:40.280
Yeah.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.880
That'd be, um,
grouse, thank you.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.280
It's quiet, isn't it?

05:50.400 --> 05:53.240
You mean without Mumtrying to kill my girlfriend?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.960
Oh, Cheryl holds her own.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.000
[laughs]

05:56.120 --> 05:57.400
Is this that ATM thing?

05:57.520 --> 05:59.440
Yeah.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.040
The impossible job.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.920
Well, I thought nothing wasimpossible for the great Ted

06:03.040 --> 06:04.040
West.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.000
Then you can
pull your head in.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.560
You're losing
your touch, old man.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.600
TED: All right then.

06:08.720 --> 06:09.640
I'll jump on and
you have a seat.

06:09.760 --> 06:10.800
Show me how it's done.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.800
Sure.
Piece of piss.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.680
What are you doing?

06:25.800 --> 06:28.240
Learning.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.480
Learning heaps.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.160
This criminology stuff
is pretty dense, eh?

06:33.280 --> 06:35.200
All these big words.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.160
Yeah, it's pretty dry stuff.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.160
And this Rose woman, shesounds like a real hard lady,

06:41.280 --> 06:43.200
just from what I can make out.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.240
In fact, from what
I can make out,

06:45.360 --> 06:46.720
she sounds a hell of
a lot like Rita West.

06:49.640 --> 06:52.360
Does Rita know about this?

06:52.480 --> 06:55.040
No.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.680
Am I in here?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.560
It's primarily about thewomen and their interactions

06:59.680 --> 07:00.520
with the gang.
- Primarily.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.920
So that's a yes.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.640
Just not one of
the important ones.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.200
Yeah, we're in there.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.560
But I changed everyone's name.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.720
Yeah, Rose and Rita,
they're real different.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.560
What am I?

07:15.680 --> 07:17.240
Honey.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.240
Of course I am.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.440
Can I have my thesis back now?

07:21.560 --> 07:22.880
I need to make some revisions.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.560
Why didn't you tell meyou were writing about us?

07:25.680 --> 07:26.880
I didn't think
you'd understand.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.440
- Because I'm dumb?
- You're not dumb, Bert.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.800
Yeah, well, I
feel pretty dumb,

07:29.920 --> 07:31.440
finding out that mygirlfriend's been using me

07:31.560 --> 07:33.080
and my mates as a
research project.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.440
OK, let's make this clear.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.920
I was studying criminologybefore you and I met.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.760
So I find myself in thisunique position, by chance.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.200
What was I supposed
to do, ignore it?

07:44.320 --> 07:47.640
Yeah, well, you've putme in a unique position--

07:47.760 --> 07:49.720
like dead, if they find out.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.680
[giggles]

07:50.800 --> 07:52.480
You think that's funny?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.600
Bert, if there's
one thing I do know

07:54.720 --> 07:57.040
about Ted West and
the so-called gang,

07:57.160 --> 07:58.320
it's, they aren't killers.

07:58.440 --> 07:59.520
Well, then, you don't
know much, do you?

08:03.120 --> 08:05.600
So educate me.

08:05.720 --> 08:07.240
Teach me the truth.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.880
No, I need to think.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.040
Bert, there's
nothing to think about.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.080
It's finished.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.080
It's almost done.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.720
I just need to do the revisions.

08:14.840 --> 08:18.000
Yeah, well, better I'd getout of your way, then, hadn't I?

08:24.960 --> 08:27.280
I've been reading
"The Mother's Almanac"

08:27.400 --> 08:31.000
and "Parenting Power," butnothing's really helped.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.360
Well, Sparky is a unique boy.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.080
It all started
off so well, Rita.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.040
We got the room all set up,and Phin really got into it.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.320
He started reading him thatbook "The Halfmen of O."

08:41.440 --> 08:42.480
Oh.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.800
But then one
night, I looked in,

08:43.920 --> 08:45.760
and Sparky was
reading it to Phineas.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.600
And I think that sort of tookthe fun out of it for Phin.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.760
He is very smart for his age.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.560
CAROL: And so loving.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.880
He gives me hugs all the time.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.920
So many hugs.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.600
Does Phineas get hugs too?

09:08.720 --> 09:10.840
Not as many as me.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.880
In fact, Phineas
thinks that Sparky

09:13.000 --> 09:14.840
might love me more than him.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.040
- Because of the hugging?- Yeah.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.960
Then stop hugging Sparky.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.840
But Sparky says he
needs the hugs to help

09:20.960 --> 09:22.320
him get over the nightmares.

09:28.080 --> 09:28.920
Sparky?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.280
I had that bad dream again.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.800
Both your heads exploded.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.520
Oh, darling.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.360
Can I sleep beside you?

09:36.480 --> 09:39.680
Back off, you weird bastard.

09:39.800 --> 09:43.480
Um, have you tried
getting Phineas

09:43.600 --> 09:45.960
and Sparky to, you know, bond?

09:46.080 --> 09:46.880
Have some guy time together?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.160
Yeah.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.720
That just freaked
Phineas out even more.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.240
Spas are quite
relaxing, aren't they?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.160
I guess.

09:59.280 --> 10:02.160
I just think how water andelectricity really don't mix.

10:02.280 --> 10:03.960
I mean, all it takes is onelittle fault in the wiring

10:04.080 --> 10:05.320
and you get in and
you push the button

[imitates zapping][screaming] [imitates zapping]

10:11.000 --> 10:12.400
Well, I'm sorry, Carol.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.640
I wish I had an answer for you.

10:14.760 --> 10:17.320
But I've got some behavioralissues at my place too.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.760
Is Wolf playing up again?

10:18.880 --> 10:21.000
Oh, no, it's that sluttypants girlfriend of his?

10:21.120 --> 10:22.120
Cheryl?

10:22.240 --> 10:23.680
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

10:23.800 --> 10:24.680
She's always so lovely.

10:36.560 --> 10:37.920
What's going on here?

10:38.040 --> 10:39.720
Helping Dad with his homework.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.600
Well, don't let me interrupt.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.320
What's in this
building next door?

10:43.440 --> 10:45.000
Ah, I already cased it.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.520
I thought maybe we could
bust through the wall

10:46.640 --> 10:47.560
like the Smith and Caughey job.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.800
But it's reinforced concrete.

10:49.920 --> 10:50.840
Hm.

10:50.960 --> 10:51.720
What's inside?

10:51.840 --> 10:53.480
A whole lot of nothing.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.400
Another corporate wastelandcompliments of Piggy Muldoon.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.080
Any alarms, cameras?

10:59.200 --> 10:59.960
Nothing to steal.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.800
You want to tell me whereyou're headed with all of this?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.320
No.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.240
I need to show you.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.320
TED: What, now?

11:09.440 --> 11:10.520
WOLF: Yeah.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.000
Unless you have
something better to do.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.360
Hey.

11:14.480 --> 11:15.320
WOLF: Hey.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.280
CHERYL: You heading out?

11:16.400 --> 11:17.280
WOLF: Yeah, just for a bit.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.280
Just the boys.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.480
Sometimes, it's
best you don't know.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.560
You'll get used to it.

11:26.680 --> 11:27.480
Or not.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.880
Are we clear of those cameras?

11:38.000 --> 11:38.760
We're good.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.320
Didn't you used to
be faster at this?

12:04.240 --> 12:05.280
Just as I thought.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.160
What is?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
Come see for yourself.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.760
No, I don't need to see it.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.720
Yeah, you do.

12:12.840 --> 12:13.720
Why?

12:13.840 --> 12:15.000
Because you do.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.280
Can't you just bloody tell me?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.760
Are yeou scared of heights?

12:18.880 --> 12:19.800
No.

12:19.920 --> 12:20.800
Bullshit, you are.

12:20.920 --> 12:22.120
No, I am bloody well am not.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.400
Then come have a look,
if you want to know

12:23.520 --> 12:24.440
how my plan's going to work.

12:27.000 --> 12:27.800
All right, then.

12:27.920 --> 12:28.680
I will.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.840
- In your own time.- I said, Wolf, I'm coming!

12:36.960 --> 12:38.680
Just bloody hold your
horses, all right?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.920
- See that?
- Yep.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.480
A courtyard behind the alley.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.720
No cameras.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.160
Which means we can
just wait down there

12:58.280 --> 12:59.520
and let them bring
the cash to us.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.440
Yeah, I guess.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.080
Yeah.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.040
No, it makes sense, yeah.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.600
One question, though.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.240
How the hell are we going toget down there, Wolf, huh?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.560
A bloody parachute?

13:09.680 --> 13:10.480
Something like that.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.600
[sighs]

13:17.720 --> 13:19.840
How'd you go?

13:19.960 --> 13:24.440
Our son is a bloody
criminal genius.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.800
Took you long enough
to figure it out.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.320
So as you came up
with the great idea,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.480
you'll get a bigger cut
of the money, right?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.080
Yeah, I don't think
that's how it works.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.640
[laughs] Well, it should.

13:50.520 --> 13:54.760
You know there's noturning back with this, eh?

13:54.880 --> 13:56.280
How do you mean?

13:56.400 --> 13:59.440
With me doing this job.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.920
This is a whole new league.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.480
You mean like a "once acriminal, always a criminal"

14:04.600 --> 14:05.360
kind of thing?

14:09.560 --> 14:10.520
Yeah, but for you as well.

14:13.800 --> 14:20.080
I mean, once I do this,
there's no backing out.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.280
You're part of this family now.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.000
I need to know that
you're OK with that.

14:35.440 --> 14:41.160
Wolf, I'm so OK with that.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.320
[laughs] I'm so fucking OK.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.200
Do I have to take him?

14:51.320 --> 14:52.400
It'll be good
for the two of you

14:52.520 --> 14:54.000
to spend some time together.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.200
Can I stay here with you?

14:55.320 --> 14:56.560
No.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.120
You need to spend some
time with your father

14:58.240 --> 14:59.840
for when I'm away for work.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.160
But he's not really my father.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.680
Well, I'm not
really your mother.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.680
You are to me.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.280
Which is nice.

15:05.400 --> 15:09.080
But then as your mother, youhave to do what I say, right?

15:09.200 --> 15:10.600
I guess.

15:10.720 --> 15:11.960
Then I want you to spendthe day with your father.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.320
OK.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.560
Good.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.680
That's that sorted.
You boys have fun.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.840
Don't you have electrician'sschool to go to or something?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.720
The place I was doing myapprenticeship burnt down.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.960
They never found
out what started it.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.480
Yeah, I want to say
that I miss Sparky,

15:38.600 --> 15:41.080
but, the truth is,
I've slept so much

15:41.200 --> 15:43.600
better without hisexploding head nightmares.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.440
Yeah, the lack of
screaming and moaning

15:45.560 --> 15:46.840
is much more restful.

15:46.960 --> 15:51.240
Boys, why don't youconcentrate on eating, OK?

15:51.360 --> 15:52.960
There you go, Rita.

15:53.080 --> 15:53.880
Thank you, Cheryl.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.600
[knocking]

15:55.720 --> 15:56.480
Only me.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.960
The meeting's at Lefty's.

15:58.080 --> 15:58.960
Yeah, I know.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.080
I kind of need to speak to Rita.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.440
It's a personal matter.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.520
No.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.000
It's an important
personal matter.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
About what?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.960
Sort of a
relationship problem?

16:09.080 --> 16:11.320
Bert, this is not between"Beauty and the Beast"

16:11.440 --> 16:13.680
and I am not Selwyn
fucking Toogood.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.680
Sorry, but I cannot
take no for an answer.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.160
I beg your pardon?

16:18.280 --> 16:19.960
You heard.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.480
Maybe you should just
hear him out, love.

16:21.600 --> 16:22.400
All right.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.560
Spit it out.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.680
Not in here.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.520
Oh, god, I hate giving advice.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.400
Since when?

16:32.480 --> 16:33.800
Make yourself right at home.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.320
Yeah.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.880
It's about Riana.
- Marry her.

16:38.000 --> 16:38.880
Have lots of babies.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.360
You'll never get a better offer.

16:40.480 --> 16:41.680
Yeah, well, that waskind of the plan until now.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.080
So don't marry her.
Dump her and move on.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.760
Will you just listen to me?

16:44.880 --> 16:47.560
What I need to say is
important for all of us.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.440
Yesterday, I found
out something, ken.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.880
I haven't been able
to sleep a wink since.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.600
She's a fuckingundercover cop, isn't she?

16:52.720 --> 16:53.520
No.

16:53.640 --> 16:54.440
No.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.880
It's kind of worse.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.520
I'm sorry.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.760
We're what?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.200
Abseiling.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.760
It's where you use ropesto lower people from a--

17:03.880 --> 17:05.720
Yeah, I know
what abseiling is.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.120
It's how we take thecameras out of the equation.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.760
Here, look.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.040
So we'll drop two guys downinto the courtyard on ropes.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.360
They sit tight, wait for
the guards to show up.

17:15.480 --> 17:17.040
Then, when they walk
through the door,

17:17.160 --> 17:20.440
our guys steal their uniforms,keys, radios, and the cash,

17:20.560 --> 17:22.120
and leave them tied up.

17:22.240 --> 17:25.480
Our guys walk out, looking, forall the world, like the guards.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.640
Get in the van, drive
it, with all the money

17:27.760 --> 17:30.920
inside, to a place where
we unlock the doors,

17:31.040 --> 17:32.520
and away we go.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.840
What if, when our
guys are coming out,

17:34.960 --> 17:37.320
they look at the camera andthe people in the cameras

17:37.440 --> 17:39.400
see that they're not the guards?

17:39.520 --> 17:41.160
Well then we'll
tell them not to look

17:41.280 --> 17:43.160
at the cameras, Phineas.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.840
And all they'll see--

17:44.960 --> 17:47.840
the back of our guys in theiruniforms, caps on their heads.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.760
Look, ths buys us the
time we need to drive

17:49.880 --> 17:51.960
the van anywhere we damn well.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.120
What if, while we'redriving around in this van,

17:54.240 --> 17:55.800
someone finds the guards?

17:55.920 --> 17:57.840
The cleaners normally
leave around midnight.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.840
The van shows up
just before 7:00.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.800
The first workers arrive inthis building around 8:00.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.400
So we have an hour.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.040
Uh, 30 minutes, before thevan's due at its next stop.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.200
OK, so we have half an hour.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.880
That's all the time we need.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.080
Any more questions?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.320
Oh, yeah, just one.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.920
What are these
dipshits doing here?

18:16.040 --> 18:17.200
Hey, that's not nice.

18:17.320 --> 18:18.120
Yeah.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.440
Yeah.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.440
I'll dip your shit if
you're not careful.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.240
They're part of the plan.

18:23.360 --> 18:24.680
Except for Sparky.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.320
I don't know what the hellhe's always doing here.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.720
Mom Carol wanted me to spendsome time with Dad Phineas.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.760
OK.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.720
So are there any
other questions?

18:32.840 --> 18:35.560
And what about the fact thatnone of us knows how to abseil?

18:35.680 --> 18:36.920
Wolf does.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.560
So he'll be one of the
two going down the wall.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.840
You, I presume,
will be the other.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.200
Actually, no.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.480
I thought it'd be better
if I was on the radio,

18:44.600 --> 18:46.120
in a coordinating role.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.760
Well, who else
is going to do it?

18:47.880 --> 18:49.160
- I will.
- [laughs]

18:49.280 --> 18:50.960
Well, that's what we're
going to find out today.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.000
Gentlemen, welcome
to climbing school.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.400
You guys, come with me.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.760
What, all the way up?

19:03.880 --> 19:05.920
Yes, all the way up, Falani.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.320
Not you.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.280
[typewriter clacking]

19:09.400 --> 19:12.240
[door creaking]

19:15.280 --> 19:17.440
The door was unlocked.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.840
I let myself in.

19:19.960 --> 19:24.000
No it wasn't You
talked to Bert.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.920
Or he's talked to you.

19:26.040 --> 19:26.800
Yeah.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.480
You've been writing
stories about me.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.520
Not stories.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.240
It's my thesis for my master's.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.040
Oh.

19:40.160 --> 19:41.360
Sounds pretty flash.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.000
Not really.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.680
And if you're worried aboutwho's going to read it,

19:44.800 --> 19:47.800
it's only going to be seenby, like, five people, tops.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.680
No, it's not.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.200
RIANA: I swear.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.880
Once it's marked, it justsits on a shelf somewhere.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.560
No, it won't Because here'swhat you're going to do.

19:58.680 --> 20:01.200
You going to gather upevery copy of this thing,

20:01.320 --> 20:03.400
all your notes, the lot.

20:03.520 --> 20:09.840
Then together, you and me,we're going to burn them.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.720
No, I won't do that.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.040
Yeah, you will.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.280
This is my life.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.640
I've worked all year for this.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.480
No.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.960
It's my life.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.720
And you fucking stole it.

20:21.840 --> 20:26.240
And if this thing continues toexist, then it puts me at risk,

20:26.360 --> 20:28.960
puts my family at risk, andit puts my friends at risk.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.960
- I changed everyone's names.- I don't care.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.280
No one will connect
this to you, ever.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.320
I swear.- I can't take that risk.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.680
So you get your stuff
and you fucking burn it.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.840
You can write another bloodythesis about something else.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.720
No, it's not that simple.

20:39.840 --> 20:40.680
Oh, really.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.160
Well, la-di-da to that.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
I'll fail the year.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.080
I don't give a flying fuck!

20:45.200 --> 20:46.120
You're not getting that!

20:46.240 --> 20:47.720
Don't you even
want to read it?

20:47.840 --> 20:49.320
Why would I want to do that?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.400
I talk about you a lot, whatan amazing woman you are--

20:51.520 --> 20:52.760
- Oh, fuck off. --strong--- Fuck off.

20:52.880 --> 20:54.200
You cannot flatter your
way out of this one.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.360
Just read it!

20:55.480 --> 20:56.400
You'll see what
I'm talking about!

20:56.520 --> 20:57.840
I don't want to
fucking read it!

20:57.960 --> 20:59.320
I don't care if you sayI'm fucking Wonder Woman,

20:59.440 --> 21:01.080
I want to destroy it, because
it threatens my world.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.280
How are you not getting thatthrough your thick fucking

21:03.400 --> 21:05.240
skull?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.160
No.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.240
Jesus Christ almighty.

21:08.360 --> 21:09.800
What is wrong with you?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.360
I'm not throwing
away a year of my life.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.640
Yeah?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.240
Well, I'm not throwing
away mine because

21:14.360 --> 21:16.400
some stupid little bitch wantsa couple of fancy letters

21:16.520 --> 21:17.280
after her name.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.240
You can do it again next year.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.040
You can write about
something else

21:24.160 --> 21:25.840
to keep the eggheads happy.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.720
That is all you're
sacrificing here.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.040
Do you get that?

21:29.160 --> 21:32.040
That is so little in
comparison to the risk

21:32.160 --> 21:34.400
that you're putting
on me and my family.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.960
Surely, surely, you
can understand that.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.600
There is no risk!

21:38.720 --> 21:40.760
No one's going to trace thisback to you or Ted or anyone!

21:51.000 --> 21:54.840
Did Bert ever tell you
what I did to him once?

21:57.760 --> 22:00.440
No.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.960
Well, he was informing.

22:03.080 --> 22:06.440
Wasn't really his fault.
He's extremely weak.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.880
A stronger man took
advantage of that.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.680
But when I found out thathe was doing this thing,

22:17.800 --> 22:20.520
I tried to kill him.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.600
I poisoned him.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.440
Clearly, he survived.

22:24.560 --> 22:28.440
But the point is
that, at the time,

22:28.560 --> 22:32.400
I didn't give a fuckwhether he lived or died.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.800
And the thing is, Riana,
I care a hell of a lot

22:35.920 --> 22:38.480
more about Bert
than I do about you.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.000
I've been to prison.

22:44.120 --> 22:48.560
I'm not scared to go back thereif it means my family are safe.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.680
So you gather up your stuff--

22:50.800 --> 22:54.880
every copy, every
scrap of paper--

22:55.000 --> 22:57.080
and you hand it over.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.960
And do not lie to me.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.400
Because if you lie,
and I find out--

23:02.520 --> 23:07.080
and I will-- you won't
see it fucking coming.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.560
I can't do that.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.960
[whimpers] I can't
do that because I

23:17.080 --> 23:18.800
don't have every copy!

23:18.920 --> 23:20.160
I gave a copy of it to my tutor.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.400
He said that he would
read it and give

23:21.520 --> 23:23.720
me notes before I handed it in.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.800
Well, isn't that
ever so nice of him?

23:27.920 --> 23:29.160
RIANA: Not really.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.280
He's been trying to get
in my pants all year.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
I think he thinks this act ofkindness will clinch the deal.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.280
Classy.

23:38.880 --> 23:43.120
Well, then, Rianna, youand I have some work to do.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.480
Tryout time.

23:47.600 --> 23:48.880
Who's up for it?

23:49.000 --> 23:50.240
LEFTY: What's the
matter, Bilkey?

23:50.360 --> 23:51.560
Don't you want to
fly like a fairy?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
Hilarious, Lefty.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.000
You sure you got
the balls for it?

23:54.120 --> 23:54.880
OK, OK.

23:55.000 --> 23:55.800
So Bilkey's out.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.320
Yes, he is.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.280
Eric, you already have a job.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.120
- But this looks way cooler.- No.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.600
Sparky, just no.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.840
You two go sit on a rock.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.120
Darijo, you've also got a job.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.600
Well, come on.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.360
Anyone can dig fuckingholes and bury fucking van!

24:11.480 --> 24:12.960
This is James Bond shit!

24:13.080 --> 24:14.160
Fuck yeah!

24:14.280 --> 24:15.440
Fuck no.

24:15.560 --> 24:17.400
This is still 20% my job.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.600
My 80% says no.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.240
OK, you two, off you go.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.560
May the best man win?

24:22.680 --> 24:24.240
Or man who doesn't
get dropped on his head

24:24.360 --> 24:25.440
by those two dick splashes.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.400
[grunts] All right, Falani,Phineas, on the rooftop, there

24:31.520 --> 24:34.480
will be no bulldozer, right?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.400
So I need you guys
to be our anchors.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.160
You'll be holding the ropeson top of the building.

24:38.280 --> 24:39.320
So if we let go?

24:39.440 --> 24:40.200
Someone dies.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.200
So watch and learn.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.200
Wait, what?

24:42.320 --> 24:43.280
OK, I begs Phineas.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.600
Ye of little faith.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.320
No offense, but all
the Islanders I've known

24:46.440 --> 24:48.240
are not good at
seeing a job through.

24:48.360 --> 24:49.680
Much offense.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.320
Mr. Bert, I shall loweryou as if God himself were

24:52.440 --> 24:53.760
sending an angel earthward.

24:53.880 --> 24:55.160
Doesn't matter.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.400
Because Ted's never goingto pick him over me.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.280
He might.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.440
You drive, Bert.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.360
That's what you do.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.640
OK, remember what I told you.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.480
Just lean back until you feelyour feet flat on the wall.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.240
And then it's just
like walking backwards.

25:08.360 --> 25:10.520
Both hands on the rope.
Don't lose control.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.600
Just nice and easy.

25:11.720 --> 25:12.520
No one's in a hurry.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.360
Whoa!

25:20.480 --> 25:21.240
That's it, Bert.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.280
Nice and slow.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.000
Whoa.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.520
Fuck me.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
How's it hanging, Bert?

25:28.760 --> 25:31.560
Shut up.

25:31.680 --> 25:32.920
Fuck!

25:33.040 --> 25:35.840
[laughs] Hey, wehaven't got all day, mate.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.880
Shut the fuck up, Lefty!

25:38.000 --> 25:38.760
Come on.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.200
Hey, it's a hell of
a time to figure out

25:44.320 --> 25:45.880
you haven't gut the guts forit, isn't it, when you're

25:46.000 --> 25:47.400
fucking halfway down the cliff?- Ah, fuck you.

25:47.520 --> 25:48.400
Hey, fuck you!

25:48.520 --> 25:49.400
You bastard.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.400
[grunting]

25:51.520 --> 25:53.400
Oh, what on Earth?

25:53.520 --> 25:55.920
Oy!

25:56.040 --> 25:57.400
Lefty, sort it out!

26:03.520 --> 26:05.240
I don't know what the hellwas going on up there,

26:05.360 --> 26:06.440
and I don't want to know.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.760
- The usual Lefty, being a cock.- Hey.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.560
I just said I
don't want to know.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.920
Bert, you're back
on following duty.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
Lefty, you and Wolf will
be going down the wall.

26:13.160 --> 26:16.280
But just get it sorted,all right, the lot of you.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.040
We get one crack at
this van, and we're

26:18.160 --> 26:19.360
not going to fuck it up.

26:19.480 --> 26:22.640
Like you did last time.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.040
[imitates gunshot]

26:28.120 --> 26:31.400
They had a fight
halfway down a cliff?

26:31.520 --> 26:33.440
Are you sure you should bethrowing in with these guys?

26:33.560 --> 26:35.040
They sound very professional.

26:35.160 --> 26:36.600
They're all right.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.840
Dad read them the riot actwhen Bert finally came down.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.440
He sulked all the way home.

26:40.560 --> 26:44.360
Yeah, well, Bert's not exactlymy favorite person either.

26:44.480 --> 26:45.560
You going somewhere?

26:45.680 --> 26:46.600
RITA: Yeah.

26:46.720 --> 26:47.560
Where?

26:47.680 --> 26:48.480
Kind of a girls' night out.

26:53.720 --> 26:54.480
Mum!

26:54.600 --> 26:55.720
I've seen it all before.

26:55.840 --> 26:56.600
Come on, blondie.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.520
Time to go.

26:57.640 --> 26:59.040
Do I have to do this?

26:59.160 --> 27:00.560
If you want to live undermy roof, then yes, you do.

27:00.680 --> 27:01.600
Do what?

27:01.720 --> 27:02.640
Nothing for you
to worry about.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.560
Come on.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.360
Bring the bag.

27:05.480 --> 27:06.280
Bye.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.240
Bye.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.120
Shan't be long.

27:14.840 --> 27:19.640
I, uh, always thought thatwhen you had babies, they'd be,

27:19.760 --> 27:23.520
you know, baby-sized.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.840
Oh, honey.

27:25.960 --> 27:29.200
I love it that you
when and not if.

27:29.320 --> 27:30.360
You haven't given up hope.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.760
I thought you were in bed.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.320
Couldn't sleep.

27:50.440 --> 27:51.760
Have a bad feeling.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.160
About what, sweetie?

27:53.280 --> 27:56.560
The job Phineas is doingwith the security van.

27:56.680 --> 27:58.040
Like the security
van where my real dad

27:58.160 --> 27:59.480
got his head blown off.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Ted says we're notallowed to talk about that.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.280
I think about it all the time.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.760
What was it like?

28:03.880 --> 28:05.040
Could you see his brain?

28:05.160 --> 28:05.920
What color was it?

28:10.920 --> 28:13.760
Maybe you should try notto think so much, Sparky.

28:13.880 --> 28:16.040
Like Dad Phineas?

28:16.160 --> 28:19.240
Something like that.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.240
No, no.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.400
Where you are is fine.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.400
You'll need these.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.720
Later, Riana.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.240
When we get there.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.760
People will get
kind of suspicious

28:44.880 --> 28:46.480
when you walk around thestreets with the balaclava on.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.640
I don't get why I can'tjust ask him for it back.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.720
I'm doing you a favor.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.600
You are?

28:53.720 --> 28:54.520
You'll see.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.520
OK.

29:02.640 --> 29:03.680
They really need to
work on their security.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.080
Go on, slutty pants.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.000
Show us what you can do.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.800
Don't call me slutty pants.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.440
Any time you'd
like would be good.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.240
[grunts]

29:28.120 --> 29:29.400
Good work.

29:29.520 --> 29:30.560
Thank you.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.160
No, I meant it
was such shit work,

29:32.280 --> 29:35.760
it looks like an amateur,which is what we want.

29:35.880 --> 29:36.640
All right.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.080
Find your thesis thingy.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.840
And you, give me that.

29:39.960 --> 29:44.520
Do what we talked about

29:44.640 --> 29:45.800
[glass breaking]
- Whoa.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.000
What are you doing?

29:47.120 --> 29:49.320
They're only pieces
of paper, love.

29:49.440 --> 29:53.160
No, I mean, what if
somebody hears you?

29:53.280 --> 29:55.640
Then we'll just have tofight our way out, won't we?

29:55.760 --> 29:56.560
Find it.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.200
Found it.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.200
Hand it over.

30:09.200 --> 30:10.440
OK.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.240
Now you can take out
your frustrations

30:12.360 --> 30:13.240
by trashing the place.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.960
If this guy really is thecreep that you say he is,

30:20.080 --> 30:21.640
then don't other people--

30:21.760 --> 30:24.320
other women-- deserve to know?

30:24.440 --> 30:27.080
Also, if you're
lucky, in the mess,

30:27.200 --> 30:31.120
no one will know that
your shit is missing.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.080
[music - split enz, "i see red"]

30:36.680 --> 30:38.520
This is what you get
for fucking with shit!

30:38.640 --> 30:40.200
SPLIT ENZ: [SINGING]
When my baby

30:40.320 --> 30:42.960
is walking down the street, Isee red, I see red, I see red.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.960
How can someone wicked
walk around free?

30:45.080 --> 30:47.920
I see red, I see red, I see red.

30:48.040 --> 30:48.920
I see red.

30:49.040 --> 30:49.880
RITA: OK.

30:50.000 --> 30:50.880
OK, Rianna!

30:51.000 --> 30:51.880
That's enough.

30:52.000 --> 30:52.920
SPLIT ENZ: [SINGING] I see red.

31:07.000 --> 31:07.800
RITA?

31:07.920 --> 31:09.720
You want my advice?

31:09.840 --> 31:14.960
Get a proper job in the actualworld where actual people live.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.600
And that is called life.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.520
SPLIT ENZ: [SINGING] I seered, I see red, I see red.

31:40.760 --> 31:41.640
No thanks.

31:41.760 --> 31:42.560
Are you sure?

31:42.680 --> 31:43.720
Hm.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.720
Everyone races
about my lamingtons.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.040
[knocking]

31:47.160 --> 31:48.000
Get that, will you?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.080
Did your last slave die off?

31:49.200 --> 31:50.560
Ah.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.960
Probably best if that comesas a surprise for you.

31:54.080 --> 31:54.880
Hi.

31:55.000 --> 31:55.760
G'day.

31:55.880 --> 31:59.280
Oh, Bert.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.640
You wanted to see me?

32:00.760 --> 32:01.520
Yep.

32:01.640 --> 32:02.560
For once I did.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.760
I have two things I need
to say to you, Bert.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.760
And you couldn't have toldme these things over the phone?

32:09.880 --> 32:11.400
RIANA: No.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.280
You need to be looking intomy eyes while I'm doing this.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.440
Is Ted here?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.000
Still asleep, but you'llbe gone before he wakes up.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.040
I will?

32:20.160 --> 32:21.840
Yep.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.600
First thing, Bert,
is, I know why you

32:24.720 --> 32:26.720
bought the Riana problem to me.

32:26.840 --> 32:29.800
Because you know
about those things?

32:29.920 --> 32:31.200
No.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.880
Because you wanted
to do your dirty work

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
for you, which I have.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.600
Don't ever do that
to me again, OK?

32:40.720 --> 32:42.200
Grow a fucking pair, Bert.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.680
You got that?

32:43.800 --> 32:46.080
Yes.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.280
And the second thing--

32:48.400 --> 32:50.800
you need to sort yourself out.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.920
Do what you need to do to getyour head back in the game

32:54.040 --> 32:58.000
and stop being a bloodycrybaby about everything.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.120
Because if you don't, and
you screw up on this job

33:01.240 --> 33:08.320
and Ted gets done for it, Iwill never fucking forgive you.

33:08.440 --> 33:09.520
Can you see how that might work?

33:09.640 --> 33:10.400
Yes.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.320
Lamington?

33:16.440 --> 33:17.240
No, I'm good.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.480
Now go and do
what you need to do.

33:24.240 --> 33:25.200
Thank you.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.080
- Yeah, you should.
- Only us.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.280
Oh, sorry for interrupting.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.200
It's all right.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.280
Bert was just leaving.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.200
Hey, Carol.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.320
Hi.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.000
Take these to the
boys downstairs.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.840
Let me guess.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.520
The adoption isn't
quite working out.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.400
There are a couple of issues--

33:40.520 --> 33:42.680
one, really, that is
getting in the way.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.000
Phineas is afraid of me.

33:44.120 --> 33:45.320
CAROL: No, I wouldn't say that.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.240
He hates me then.

33:46.360 --> 33:48.120
No, no, not hate.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.920
I just don't think
he gets you, love.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.000
We tried talking about it,but that didn't go so well.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.120
Is this about the hugs?

33:55.240 --> 33:56.960
It's a little about the hugs.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.720
But, um, it's more aboutsetting up boundaries so we can

34:00.840 --> 34:03.160
all live together as a family.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.760
What does that mean?

34:04.880 --> 34:06.000
It means you're not allowedto do weird shit to my wife,

34:06.120 --> 34:08.200
you freak!

34:08.320 --> 34:09.720
Oh, dear.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.560
I-- I don't think we'reputting this very positively.

34:11.680 --> 34:12.440
It's OK, Mum.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.800
I understand.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.240
You do?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.480
I just love you so much.

34:17.600 --> 34:19.240
I wish we were polar bears.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.520
Sorry, what?

34:20.640 --> 34:21.840
Mother polar bears
dig underground dens

34:21.960 --> 34:23.320
for their cubs.

34:23.440 --> 34:25.040
They live with them togetherin the winter months.

34:25.160 --> 34:29.960
I'd like to live in a den withmy mum, just the two of us.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.880
And then, this morning,things really came to a head.

34:34.000 --> 34:34.880
[explosion]

34:35.000 --> 34:35.880
[screams]

34:36.000 --> 34:39.360
[panting]

34:45.480 --> 34:47.480
Lawn mowers are
dangerous things.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.120
All the same, I
think it would probably

34:49.240 --> 34:52.200
be best if Sparky comesback here before, you know--

34:52.320 --> 34:53.800
Phineas kills him?

34:53.920 --> 34:54.680
Is that all right?

34:57.440 --> 34:59.000
Yeah, sure.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.160
Off you go.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.760
Back to your den, I suppose.

35:04.600 --> 35:10.280
Just for the record, you'rethe best mum I ever had.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.240
[sighs]

35:20.720 --> 35:23.720
She made me burn
a year's work.

35:23.840 --> 35:24.640
I know.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.720
Was that the only
reason you're with me?

35:31.840 --> 35:32.720
What?

35:32.840 --> 35:34.800
Research.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.680
I just think about all thenights we sat up together,

35:37.800 --> 35:39.640
and me telling you everything.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.840
No, I loved those nights.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.360
How cool for you, eh?

35:43.480 --> 35:48.440
Being undercover, dating
a real life criminal.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.640
Yeah, it was.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.200
Because I was with you.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.080
That's what made it cool.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.480
Not anything else.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, but the wholetime, you was lying to me.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.280
Well, two can play at
that game, right, honey?

35:58.400 --> 35:59.960
You could have gotten
me fucking killed.

36:00.080 --> 36:01.800
I didn't know that.

36:01.920 --> 36:02.680
I'm sorry.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.520
I swear I am.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.240
But it's gone--
everything, every word.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.120
It's over.

36:09.240 --> 36:12.040
Yeah.

36:12.160 --> 36:13.080
Yeah, it is.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.560
No, not you and me.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.720
We-- we don't have to be.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.000
I can't trust
you anymore, Riana.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.720
I can't be around you.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.120
Yes, you can.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.640
Don't you get it?
It-- it's gone.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.200
No, you're the one
who doesn't get it.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.000
I don't trust you.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.720
We had that thing where Iwas the runt of the litter

36:30.840 --> 36:33.840
with the hottest girlfriend.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.320
And you taught me things
about myself that I'll--

36:36.440 --> 36:38.400
I'll treasure forever.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.600
But I don't trust you.

36:40.720 --> 36:41.520
I love you.

36:45.440 --> 36:49.720
But-- [sighs] take
it easy, yeah?

37:04.120 --> 37:04.920
Stick to driving.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.040
Stick to fucking driving, Bert.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.960
[tires peel out]

37:13.520 --> 37:14.440
Hey!

37:14.560 --> 37:15.760
Sparky's welcome home party.

37:15.880 --> 37:16.640
Great.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.240
I liked what we
did last night.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.400
It was fun.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.560
I was necessary.

37:32.680 --> 37:33.800
I want to do more.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.520
Well, you are welcome
to it, because I'd

37:35.640 --> 37:37.560
much rather do this.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.080
We're off down the pub.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.600
You're not staying forSparky's welcome home party.

37:42.720 --> 37:43.600
No.

37:43.720 --> 37:44.720
We need to talk.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.600
Work stuff.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.000
I want to do work like them.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.600
Us chicks can do
what they can, right?

37:57.160 --> 37:59.960
Well, you are right
about the work thing.

38:00.080 --> 38:01.680
I'll give you that.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.280
This place isn't a bloody hotel.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.480
So if you want to stay here,you do need to pay your way.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.160
Fine.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.640
I'll start looking tomorrow.

38:09.760 --> 38:11.440
But jobs are pretty thinon the ground these days.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.920
Actually, I know
someone who'd hire

38:13.040 --> 38:14.480
you today, given the chance.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.480
Yeah?

38:16.600 --> 38:18.480
What sort of job?

38:18.600 --> 38:21.200
Hospitality--
that kind of thing.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.880
Sort of like waitressing or--

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, sort of.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.640
Yeah, I'm game.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.600
[laughs]

38:28.720 --> 38:29.960
Danny.

38:30.080 --> 38:31.280
Thanks for meeting with us.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.280
I know you're a busy man.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.280
Business is pumping, Rita.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.920
But I always make time tomeet prospective employees.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.520
Hey, you must be Cheryl.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.400
Wow.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.320
You are stunning.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.160
Thank you, Danny.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.240
And this is my son Hayden.

38:47.360 --> 38:49.360
But anyway, I hear
you're looking for work.

38:49.480 --> 38:50.240
Sure.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.000
Cheryl's very motivated.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.520
Excellent.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.040
Well, I'm not sure how muchRita's actually told you.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.000
Mm.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.920
But basically what weoffer is high quality service

39:00.040 --> 39:01.600
to very wealthy customers.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.960
So I'd get tips.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.080
- Yes, lots of tips.
- Mm-hmm.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.600
Well, if you go
the extra mile.

39:09.720 --> 39:12.520
And what sort of
hours would it be?

39:12.640 --> 39:16.400
Um, mostly nights.
Sometimes days.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.520
Oh, so the restaurant's
open for lunch?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.040
Uh, yes, well,
a lot of business

39:25.160 --> 39:27.760
is done during the
lunch hours and them.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.760
Listen, Cheryl, I am a firmbeliever in first impressions.

39:31.880 --> 39:35.880
And I think that you are goingto be perfect for this job.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.280
Do you really think so?

39:37.400 --> 39:41.360
THERESA: [YELLING] Itold you not to touch me!

39:41.480 --> 39:42.960
He's done it again, Danny.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.480
Theresa, what the hell?

39:44.600 --> 39:47.000
That fucking merchantbanker trying to go bareback.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.640
I had to punch him on the nose.

39:48.760 --> 39:49.840
DANNY: Hayden, go sort this out.

39:49.960 --> 39:50.840
HAYDEN: Do I have to?

39:50.960 --> 39:52.240
Yes, you do!

39:52.360 --> 39:54.080
It's what I'm
training you to do!

39:54.200 --> 39:56.000
This is a fucking brothel.

39:56.120 --> 39:56.960
Yeah.

39:57.080 --> 39:58.600
You think I'm a prostitute?

39:58.720 --> 39:59.880
RITA: Oh, sorry!

40:00.000 --> 40:01.200
It's just when you
said you were game,

40:01.320 --> 40:03.280
I assumed you meant
you were on the game.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.040
Oh, you're such a bitch!

40:06.160 --> 40:09.240
And to you, I always will be.

40:09.360 --> 40:11.160
Would you stop
sending me these women?

40:11.280 --> 40:12.320
I'm so sorry.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.600
But I've got to
have my fun somehow.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.400
[laughs]

40:16.520 --> 40:19.240
Rita and Cheryl seem
to be getting on better.

40:19.360 --> 40:20.920
And do you think that'll last?

40:21.040 --> 40:21.800
No.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.720
No.

40:27.160 --> 40:28.600
You should be proud
of yourself, son.

40:28.720 --> 40:29.960
Why?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.880
Well, the truth is, if
you hadn't stepped in,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.080
I'd probably still be sittingaround trying to work out how

40:34.200 --> 40:35.480
to dodge these bloody cameras.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.040
Drawing your shitty drawings.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.280
Yeah.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.280
You made it a reality, Wolf.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.760
This job, it's your job now.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.520
I wouldn't trust
it to anyone else.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.440
To the job.

40:46.560 --> 40:47.320
To the job.

40:50.120 --> 40:53.120
MIKE: Evening, gents.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.560
Oh, look, son.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.640
It's bacon and eggs.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.360
Touching family momentyou got going on here, Ted.

40:58.480 --> 40:59.480
Yeah.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.880
What do they call
it in the books?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.280
Quality time?

41:02.400 --> 41:04.240
And is this boy of
yours old enough to be

41:04.360 --> 41:05.600
drinking in this establishment.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.840
Come on, I'm having a
beer with my son, Mike.

41:07.960 --> 41:11.840
Don't you have other crimesor other people's children

41:11.960 --> 41:14.320
to be looking after?

41:14.440 --> 41:16.960
But I've always got
time for you, Ted.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.040
Don't you forget that.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.720
[scoffs]

41:25.840 --> 41:27.520
Bacon and eggs?

41:27.640 --> 41:29.760
Better than your usual
piggy jokes, I guess.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.880
Hey, don't knock
the joke, son.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.640
[chuckles]

41:39.800 --> 41:43.000
