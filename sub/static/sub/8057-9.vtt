WEBVTT

00:02.003 --> 00:04.121
Merry Congratu-Christmas!

00:04.403 --> 00:05.521
- What?
- Half "Merry Christmas,"

00:05.573 --> 00:07.039
half "Congratulations,"

00:07.041 --> 00:08.440
because
I just received some news.

00:08.442 --> 00:11.877
You, Ron Swanson,
have been nominated for an award

00:11.879 --> 00:13.996
from the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association.

00:13.998 --> 00:16.082
How did you hear
about that?

00:16.084 --> 00:17.383
I've had
a "Ron Swanson" Google alert

00:17.385 --> 00:19.618
for seven years
and it finally paid off.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.755
Recently,
I made a chair.

00:22.757 --> 00:26.642
When I was finished,
I thought it was a good chair.

00:26.644 --> 00:30.096
I submitted it to the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Association,

00:30.098 --> 00:33.966
who felt it merited
consideration for an award.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.302
It's been a real whirlwind.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.453
I have to confess,

00:37.455 --> 00:39.355
I'm very honored
by this nomination.

00:39.357 --> 00:40.523
Right?

00:40.525 --> 00:41.690
This might be
the first time

00:41.692 --> 00:43.359
I've ever wanted
to attend an event.

00:43.361 --> 00:45.211
Oh, my God,
I love events!

00:45.263 --> 00:46.428
I can't wait
to go tonight.

00:46.430 --> 00:47.730
Why are you going?

00:47.732 --> 00:49.565
As your self-appointed
emotional guardian,

00:49.567 --> 00:52.068
it is my duty
to love and support you.

00:52.070 --> 00:53.069
Plus, you know,
this is a big deal.

00:53.071 --> 00:54.287
You shouldn't
be there alone.

00:54.289 --> 00:55.988
That's correct.
I'm bringing Diane.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.156
Things are going
very well with us.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.242
Even better.
I am very excited to meet Diane.

00:59.244 --> 01:01.110
You're not taking "no"
for an answer, are you?

01:01.112 --> 01:02.128
Oh, I forgot
to sing you

01:02.130 --> 01:03.779
my merry Congratu-Christmas
carol.

01:03.781 --> 01:06.666
♪ Jingle bells, jingle yay,
jingle good for you ♪

01:06.668 --> 01:07.800
- Get out.
- Yup.

01:28.138 --> 01:30.489
How about the new sushi place
in Eagleton?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.640
I'm allergic
to sushi.

01:31.642 --> 01:34.327
Every time I eat
more than 80 sushis, I barf.

01:34.329 --> 01:36.445
Hey, Ann, you been to
any swanky restaurants lately?

01:36.447 --> 01:37.864
- What's the occasion?
- It's December.

01:37.866 --> 01:39.148
It's the time
we celebrate

01:39.150 --> 01:41.500
our most sacred
and special event:

01:41.502 --> 01:43.786
♪ Jerry Dinner
♪ Jerry Dinner

01:43.788 --> 01:47.323
- ♪ Jerry Dinner
- ♪ Jerry Dinner

01:47.325 --> 01:48.841
what the hell
is Jerry Dinner?

01:48.843 --> 01:51.210
Every time we laugh
at something stupid Jerry does,

01:51.212 --> 01:53.262
we put a dollar
in this box.

01:53.264 --> 01:55.381
At the end of the year,
we take all the cash

01:55.383 --> 01:57.600
and treat ourselves
to a fancy dinner.

01:57.602 --> 01:59.218
This year, we have...

01:59.220 --> 02:02.171
$516.

02:02.173 --> 02:04.974
Aw, jeez!

02:04.976 --> 02:07.276
And that's 517.

02:07.278 --> 02:10.062
Oh!

02:10.064 --> 02:11.731
518.

02:11.733 --> 02:15.851
You guys,
that's so mean.

02:15.853 --> 02:18.154
It's not mean
if he doesn't know about it.

02:18.156 --> 02:20.239
It's like talking about people
behind their backs.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.325
- Everybody wins.
- No.

02:22.327 --> 02:24.744
You should at least
invite Jerry to the dinner.

02:24.746 --> 02:25.912
Ha!

02:25.914 --> 02:27.830
That's hilarious.
You should do stand-up.

02:28.332 --> 02:30.499
If you're kidding, you suck,
but if you're serious,

02:30.501 --> 02:32.218
I actually have been
thinking about it.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.505
Hey, April, Matlock called.
He wants his cardigan back.

02:36.507 --> 02:38.707
Boom! I'm out.

02:39.709 --> 02:40.726
Who's Matlock?

02:40.728 --> 02:41.928
Hey, bud.

02:41.930 --> 02:43.379
- Hey!
- How are you?

02:43.381 --> 02:46.048
Great. I just finished making
an entry in my dream journal.

02:46.950 --> 02:51.320
This time, the giant spider
got caught in my web.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.440
Progress.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.993
So I feel like we haven't
gotten a ton of time together

02:56.995 --> 02:58.577
since I got back
from D.C.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.729
Well, we both
are in serious relationships.

03:00.731 --> 03:03.565
You have Leslie
and I have my therapist,

03:03.567 --> 03:05.952
Dr. Richard Nygard,
who I see 15 times a week.

03:05.954 --> 03:09.205
Well, Leslie has plans
tonight, so I'm solo.

03:09.207 --> 03:11.257
- You wanna hang out?
- I'd love to.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.759
It--it'll be just like
old times in Indianapolis.

03:13.991 --> 03:16.045
- We're back.
- All right.

03:18.249 --> 03:20.716
Lots of hugs.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.853
Welcome to the Indiana
Fine Woodworking Awards,

03:23.855 --> 03:26.272
or as I like to call it,
heaven.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.756
- Ron.
- Ah!

03:27.758 --> 03:29.809
Leslie, may I present
Diane Lewis?

03:29.811 --> 03:31.260
- Oh.
- Diane, this is Leslie Knope.

03:31.262 --> 03:33.813
Diane, wow. Ron has told me
so much about you,

03:33.815 --> 03:35.948
in that he has told me your name
is Diane, and you exist.

03:35.950 --> 03:36.949
Oh, yeah.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.117
He's not
a big sharer.

03:38.119 --> 03:39.618
I don't even know
what his middle name is.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.987
Oh, it's Ulysses.

03:40.989 --> 03:42.621
I can see
why he didn't tell me that.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.657
Mary, mother of God.

03:46.911 --> 03:48.461
That's
Christian Becksvoort!

03:48.463 --> 03:50.413
He's the modern master
of the Shaker style.

03:50.415 --> 03:53.165
I never dreamed that I would
see him in the flesh.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.967
Go over
and say hello.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.286
No, I'm sure he gets swamped
with attention all the time.

03:57.788 --> 04:00.089
Ooh, if you ladies
will excuse me,

04:00.091 --> 04:02.758
there is a jack plane
that needs my attention.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.393
Go on then.

04:04.395 --> 04:06.479
So tell me
everything about yourself:

04:06.481 --> 04:08.431
Your kids,
your hobbies.

04:08.433 --> 04:09.482
What are
your five biggest hopes,

04:09.484 --> 04:11.517
dreams, fears,
and regrets?

04:12.802 --> 04:14.270
In honor
of Jerry Dinner,

04:14.272 --> 04:17.805
let's each say our favorite
Jerry moment from the past year.

04:17.808 --> 04:19.442
- Yes.
- Mine was...

04:19.444 --> 04:21.077
The time
he slipped on a cinnabon

04:21.079 --> 04:22.478
and landed
in a bunch of garbage.

04:23.865 --> 04:27.033
My favorite Jerry moment
was when he ate a bowl of glue.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.369
My favorite Jerry moment
is when

04:30.371 --> 04:33.622
you switched out his potato soup
with glue and he didn't know.

04:33.624 --> 04:35.007
You're so cute

04:35.009 --> 04:36.042
when you're bullying,
babe.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.010
You know what?
Ann was right.

04:38.012 --> 04:40.713
This is mean.
We are going to pick up Jerry.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.298
- What?
- No!

04:42.300 --> 04:44.300
It's Christmastime. Don't you
want to be good people?

04:44.302 --> 04:45.551
- Not really.
- Never.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.552
Hey,
if we're going that way,

04:46.554 --> 04:47.636
can we stop at our place
real quick?

04:47.638 --> 04:49.138
'Cause I forgot
to put on deodorant.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.941
And a jacket
and one of my socks.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.326
Plus, I gotta poop, but
I could stop anywhere for that.

04:54.328 --> 04:57.563
I know you didn't, but if you
had gone to Hogwarts Academy,

04:57.565 --> 04:58.981
which House do you think
you would have been?

04:58.983 --> 05:00.950
Look, obviously,

05:00.952 --> 05:02.068
I want to say Gryffindor...

05:02.070 --> 05:03.685
But I've got to go
with Hufflepuff.

05:03.687 --> 05:05.121
I respect
your honesty.

05:05.123 --> 05:07.873
Gryffindor.
Seeker on the Quidditch team.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.409
Diane, that's my chair,
right there.

05:10.411 --> 05:13.245
It's beautiful, Ron.
Yours is the winner.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.164
I'm not sure
I stand a chance.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.200
Hey,
you most certainly do.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.836
They'd be crazy
not to vote for you.

05:20.838 --> 05:22.088
Which one is Ron's?

05:22.090 --> 05:24.223
I don't know.

05:24.225 --> 05:26.392
Smart, funny,
independent, and sexy?

05:26.394 --> 05:29.895
Diane Lewis?
More like Diane Sawyer.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.898
Whoa! What is going on
at the Gergiches?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.233
Whoa.

05:34.235 --> 05:36.402
Oh, my God! Jerry's having
a Christmas party!

05:36.404 --> 05:37.853
I can't believe
he didn't invite us.

05:37.855 --> 05:39.071
How dare he!

05:39.073 --> 05:40.189
What'd we ever
do to him?

05:40.191 --> 05:41.524
It's probably
just family.

05:41.526 --> 05:43.559
And Ben and Chris.

05:43.561 --> 05:46.946
And Ann. I didn't even know
she knew Jerry.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.399
Wow. The Gergiches
really go all out.

05:50.401 --> 05:52.535
This is incredible.

05:52.537 --> 05:54.336
Mmm!
This is literally

05:54.338 --> 05:56.755
the best non-fat eggnog
I've ever had.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.508
Remain calm,
but I think you just drank

05:59.510 --> 06:02.744
some of the regular,
full-fat eggnog.

06:02.746 --> 06:05.047
Chris,
one cup won't kill you.

06:05.049 --> 06:08.767
No, but it will add
exactly 440 calories.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.354
But you know what?
I'm fine.

06:12.856 --> 06:15.558
You only live once.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.060
Mmm! I don't know
if you know this,

06:18.062 --> 06:19.261
but things
with fat in them

06:19.263 --> 06:21.397
taste way better
than things with no fat.

06:21.399 --> 06:23.449
Yeah, Chris--
everybody knows that.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.485
Ron, guess
why my thumbs are up.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.936
No.

06:27.938 --> 06:30.439
Because I'm giving you
my 100% approval about Diane.

06:30.741 --> 06:32.825
She is perfect for you.
She gets you.

06:32.927 --> 06:36.078
She is at the bar right
now ordering a Lagavulin, neat

06:36.080 --> 06:37.963
for you. I mean,
she's even putting up

06:37.965 --> 06:41.333
with all this stupid,
boring woodworking stuff.

06:41.335 --> 06:44.303
I'm sorry, but, you know,
it's not the Super Bowl, guys.

06:44.305 --> 06:45.921
Let's take it down
a notch.

06:45.923 --> 06:48.123
Anyway,
you have my approval.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.141
I don't need
your approval.

06:49.143 --> 06:50.259
- But you have it.
- Don't need it.

06:50.261 --> 06:52.628
But you got it.

06:52.630 --> 06:54.346
This could
end up being

06:54.348 --> 06:56.315
the best night
in Ron Swanson's life.

06:56.317 --> 06:57.600
I am so, so happy
for him--

06:57.602 --> 07:00.986
Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.971
Wow,
look at this room.

07:02.973 --> 07:05.991
So much wood,
ready to be worked.

07:07.911 --> 07:08.861
[Bleep] me!

07:12.051 --> 07:14.216
Alert...
alert, alert, alert.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.016
She's here, isn't she?

07:16.018 --> 07:19.687
Oh, hey, Ron.
What a coincidence.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.855
Gosh, I never dreamed
you'd be here.

07:21.857 --> 07:23.908
Tammy,
this is Diane.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.211
Diane, this is a piece
of human garbage named Tammy,

07:27.213 --> 07:28.546
who is also
my ex-wife.

07:28.548 --> 07:30.548
Twice ex-wife.
We were married twice.

07:30.550 --> 07:31.749
And divorced twice.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.834
Everything is done.
They are totally done.

07:33.836 --> 07:35.553
Tammy,
what are you doing here?

07:35.995 --> 07:39.373
Oh, I just have a little
something I need to get drilled.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.509
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

07:41.511 --> 07:43.310
Everything's fine,
we're just gonna chat.

07:43.312 --> 07:46.964
Shouldn't you be at the library,
forcing people to borrow books?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.098
Leslie,
you and I both know

07:48.100 --> 07:49.650
that the library closes
at 3:00 p.m.

07:49.652 --> 07:51.152
Of course it does.

07:51.154 --> 07:52.653
Besides, I like
to keep tabs on Ron.

07:52.655 --> 07:54.304
So you can ruin
his life?

07:54.306 --> 07:55.739
So I can have fun
with him,

07:55.741 --> 07:58.809
and sometimes ruining his life
can be a part of that, sure.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.661
This may be
the hardest challenge yet

08:00.663 --> 08:02.145
for Leslie Knope,
emotional guardian.

08:02.147 --> 08:04.198
I need to protect
a sweet couple

08:04.200 --> 08:06.167
from a sex-crazed
demon librarian

08:06.169 --> 08:08.919
who makes me question my stance
on using the "B" word.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.337
I don't know,
maybe just this once.

08:10.339 --> 08:13.323
No, Leslie, fight it.
Fight it.

08:14.325 --> 08:16.660
It looks warm in there!

08:16.662 --> 08:17.845
Warm and happy.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.297
Mm, look at
that gingerbread man.

08:20.299 --> 08:22.466
What? I don't see
any gingerbread cookies.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.334
I'm talking about that
jacked-up, light-skinned dude.

08:24.336 --> 08:25.686
Look like
Blake Griffin.

08:26.188 --> 08:27.521
You guys!

08:27.523 --> 08:30.357
There's a buffet--
in the house!

08:30.859 --> 08:32.142
I didn't even know
you could do that!

08:32.144 --> 08:33.611
We need
to crash this party.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.798
Ann, let us in.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.150
Let's go.

08:41.236 --> 08:42.369
Well, well, well.

08:42.371 --> 08:45.522
You want to come
into Jerry's party?

08:45.524 --> 08:46.874
And why is that?

08:46.876 --> 08:48.692
I need a place
to deliver this baby, Ann.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.044
It's coming out of me right now.
I'm pregnant.

08:51.046 --> 08:52.496
This is a lovely party

08:52.498 --> 08:55.249
thrown by a lovely man
and his lovely family.

08:55.251 --> 08:57.001
There's no place
for meanies.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.169
Aw, forget it,
I'm coming in.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.170
Ow!

09:00.172 --> 09:01.755
- Get off me.
- Wait.

09:02.257 --> 09:03.707
You're so weak, really?

09:03.709 --> 09:04.758
I mean,

09:04.760 --> 09:06.176
I'm barely even
doing anything.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.262
Are you iron-deficient?
Let me look at your palm.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.598
Ow. It's because
of your man strength,

09:10.990 --> 09:12.182
Man Perkins.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.434
Let us in, Ann.

09:13.436 --> 09:14.768
It's cold outside,
and I can't wear mittens

09:14.770 --> 09:16.687
'cause they're unflattering
to my hands.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.439
Sorry, guys.
This is your penance.

09:18.441 --> 09:20.891
You can come in if you
do something nice for Jerry.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.027
Hey, I already
did something nice for Jerry.

09:23.029 --> 09:25.362
I drove here
to take him to Jerry Dinner.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.731
Oh, Donna.
You can come in.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.749
Okay.

09:28.751 --> 09:29.900
What? What about us?

09:29.902 --> 09:32.086
- What? Donna!
- Merry critches, bitches!

09:32.088 --> 09:33.754
Donna, don't leave us!
Donna?

09:33.756 --> 09:35.072
Oh, well, whatever.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.291
It's Jerry's party.
How cool could it be?

09:37.593 --> 09:38.709
Santa!

09:38.711 --> 09:40.077
- They have a Santa!
- Oh, my God.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.745
- What?
- Aw!

09:41.747 --> 09:45.749
Welcome to the Indiana Fine
Woodworking Association Awards.

09:48.137 --> 09:50.104
I'm your host,
Martin Housely,

09:50.106 --> 09:51.305
and wow,
it's gonna be a great show--

09:51.307 --> 09:52.306
knock on wood.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.760
- That's good.
- Oh, my gosh.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.762
What a coinky-dinky. Look,
we're sitting at the same table!

09:58.764 --> 10:01.699
Tammy,
this table is reserved.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.867
A guy traded me his seat
for a peek and a squeeze.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.869
That's my boob and my butt,
respectively.

10:05.871 --> 10:07.905
Remember that, Ron?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.290
Subtle.

10:09.292 --> 10:10.941
Well, you know, they asked me
if I would host this event,

10:10.943 --> 10:14.945
and I said, "Would I?"

10:15.447 --> 10:17.447
Ben, come meet
Jerry's wife.

10:17.449 --> 10:18.382
Gayle?

10:19.968 --> 10:23.453
- Happy holidays, Chris.
- It's so good to see you.

10:23.455 --> 10:24.588
I have someone
I'd like you to meet.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.124
I'm Gayle Gergich.

10:28.393 --> 10:30.594
Gayle--
you're Gayle?

10:30.596 --> 10:32.012
Jerry's
beautiful wife...

10:32.014 --> 10:34.648
- Oh.
- Who looks like that.

10:34.650 --> 10:35.966
Gayle, I hope you're not

10:35.968 --> 10:38.068
in any way uncomfortable
that I'm here,

10:38.070 --> 10:41.105
- since I dated your daughter.
- Oh, not at all.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.157
You're welcome here
any time.

10:43.459 --> 10:46.276
Oops, there's a little hair
on your shoulder.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.477
Oh.

10:47.479 --> 10:51.281
Well, look who's a silver fox.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.001
Will you look at that?

10:54.003 --> 10:55.953
I'm sorry,
you're okay?

10:55.955 --> 10:58.155
You don't feel like
your body is in decay

10:58.157 --> 10:59.423
or death
is inevitable?

10:59.425 --> 11:03.660
My, my. Somebody's
being a gloomy goose.

11:03.662 --> 11:07.181
Yeah.
Relax, gloomy goose.

11:07.183 --> 11:11.719
Welcome, everybody,
to another Gergich Christmas.

11:11.721 --> 11:14.138
Sadly, one of our
three beautiful angels,

11:14.140 --> 11:15.472
Millicent,
couldn't be here tonight,

11:15.474 --> 11:18.392
but our other two beauties--
Miriam and Gladys--

11:18.394 --> 11:21.395
are going to help Gayle
and me play a little tune.

11:23.816 --> 11:28.535
♪ Here we go a-caroling,
among the leaves so green ♪

11:28.537 --> 11:31.822
- ♪ here we come a-wandering,
so fair to be seen ♪

11:31.824 --> 11:34.024
♪ love and joy
come to you ♪

11:34.026 --> 11:36.377
♪ and to you
glad Christmas too ♪

11:36.379 --> 11:40.998
♪ and God bless you
and send you a happy new year ♪

11:41.000 --> 11:45.035
♪ and God send you
a happy new year ♪

11:48.841 --> 11:50.207
I'm going to
call a cab.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.142
Why does everyone act
like Jerry's the victim here?

11:52.144 --> 11:53.343
He's the one
that didn't invite us

11:53.345 --> 11:55.479
to his Christmas party.

11:55.481 --> 11:57.981
- Jerry Filter!
- Jerry Filter!

11:57.983 --> 11:59.433
Who's Jerry Filter?

11:59.435 --> 12:02.236
Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends
a lot of annoying emails.

12:02.238 --> 12:04.855
So a while ago, I put
a filter on all our accounts.

12:04.857 --> 12:07.524
Everything from Jerry
goes directly to spam.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.360
A-a-and...

12:10.362 --> 12:12.863
Here's our invitation.

12:12.865 --> 12:15.065
There's three years
of nice messages on here.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.617
"Congratulations
on your wedding.

12:16.619 --> 12:18.752
I'm rooting for you kids.
Jerry."

12:18.754 --> 12:20.254
"Hope you have
the best birthday, Tom."

12:20.556 --> 12:23.290
I just tied my high score
in Snake.

12:25.409 --> 12:29.113
Our next award
is for "Achievement in Chairs."

12:29.115 --> 12:32.599
The nominees are:
Asa Christiana for chair,

12:32.601 --> 12:34.601
Ron Swanson for chair,

12:34.603 --> 12:37.221
- H.W. Davenport for chair.
- So exciting, Ron.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.690
Okay, Ron,
this is your moment.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.558
Tune her out.
She's not even here.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.227
And the winner is...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.028
Ron Swanson for chair.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.098
Oh, wow! Whoo!

12:56.107 --> 13:00.127
This award is the only one
I'd ever give a damn about.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.748
I made my first chair
when I was five,

13:04.750 --> 13:06.834
but the quality of the wood
was wanting,

13:06.836 --> 13:09.803
so when I turned nine,
I used my factory wages

13:09.805 --> 13:12.789
to purchase
some beautiful local walnut.

13:15.126 --> 13:17.961
Uh, thank you...
for this...

13:17.963 --> 13:21.098
Uh, this all good--
night good.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.484
Uh...

13:23.786 --> 13:25.519
There it is.

13:32.994 --> 13:34.528
Hey, you're looking
at a picture of Millie.

13:34.530 --> 13:36.663
You want to take off,
grab some vegan fries?

13:36.665 --> 13:38.499
She really
was delightful.

13:38.501 --> 13:40.650
I truly wish her
all the best.

13:40.652 --> 13:44.288
Man, maybe going to therapy
1,000 times a week is helping.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.039
I mean, if you'd seen
that picture a month ago,

13:46.041 --> 13:47.257
you would have
fallen apart.

13:47.759 --> 13:49.326
It's just a picture.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.961
- Millie!
- Hi, mom!

13:52.431 --> 13:54.464
We wanted to surprise you
and come home early.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.684
Oh, hey, Chris.

13:59.053 --> 14:00.304
Hi.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.472
Let's take a moment now
to remember

14:02.474 --> 14:04.858
those woodworkers
who are no longer with us,

14:04.860 --> 14:08.511
and the beautiful coffins
they all designed themselves.

14:12.034 --> 14:13.033
Hey.

14:13.035 --> 14:14.535
- Hey.
- Have you seen Ron?

14:14.537 --> 14:17.187
He disappeared after the speech
and I can't find him anywhere.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.689
Diane-- ugh.
The stuff with Tammy

14:19.691 --> 14:22.042
is so complex and weird
and gross.

14:22.044 --> 14:24.527
It just would probably be better
if you let me handle it.

14:24.529 --> 14:26.029
I'm not worried
about Tammy.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.198
I mean, I'm a middle school
vice-principal.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.500
I deal with hormonal psychopaths
all the time.

14:30.502 --> 14:31.969
Oh, great. Good.

14:31.971 --> 14:34.537
- What concerns me is you.
- You who?

14:34.539 --> 14:36.173
- You you.
- You me?

14:36.175 --> 14:37.707
You're the one who's been
at his side all night.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.042
You're the one
who's been protecting him,

14:39.044 --> 14:41.011
you're the one who knows
all the intimate details

14:41.013 --> 14:42.813
of his romantic history
with that monster.

14:42.815 --> 14:44.898
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Diane, you misunderstand.

14:44.900 --> 14:46.483
I'm happily engaged.

14:46.485 --> 14:49.486
You and Ron have an intimacy
that I just don't understand,

14:49.488 --> 14:51.822
so if there is a threat
to my relationship with Ron,

14:51.824 --> 14:55.242
it's not Tammy.
It's you.

14:55.244 --> 14:57.411
Okay, folks,
fasten your seatbelts.

14:57.413 --> 15:00.247
It's the big one:
Best Desk.

15:04.007 --> 15:05.557
Where's Diane?
I need her.

15:05.807 --> 15:07.257
- She left.
- Of course.

15:07.259 --> 15:08.508
Tammy ruins everything.

15:08.510 --> 15:09.876
No, she left
because of me.

15:10.478 --> 15:12.645
She's threatened
by our relationship.

15:15.183 --> 15:16.099
That's ridiculous.

15:16.101 --> 15:18.435
I don't think of you
romantically.

15:18.437 --> 15:20.770
You're pro-government,
you never stop talking,

15:20.772 --> 15:23.073
and you have blonde hair.
You're my worst nightmare.

15:23.075 --> 15:24.858
Excuse me,
one man's "worst nightmare"

15:24.860 --> 15:27.744
is every other man's
"total package."

15:27.746 --> 15:29.729
But the point is,
I don't think it's about dating.

15:29.731 --> 15:31.898
I kind of see
where Diane is coming from.

15:31.900 --> 15:35.068
We are close friends, and
I'm very involved in your life.

15:35.070 --> 15:36.336
I wouldn't say
we're close.

15:36.338 --> 15:38.288
By Swanson standards,
we're close.

15:38.290 --> 15:39.456
I know
when your birthday is.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.874
So does Baskin-Robbins.

15:40.876 --> 15:43.343
I know that you
secretly love artichokes

15:43.345 --> 15:45.178
- and plums.
- Keep your voice down, woman!

15:46.764 --> 15:49.132
Fine, we're friends.
So what do I do?

15:49.434 --> 15:51.051
Tammy's waiting for me
in my car.

15:51.553 --> 15:54.104
I think you should take my car
and go get Diane,

15:54.106 --> 15:56.556
and I will
handle Tammy.

15:56.858 --> 15:57.774
Thank you.

15:57.776 --> 15:59.509
Protect your eyes,
she's a gouger.

15:59.611 --> 16:00.426
Good to know.

16:00.678 --> 16:03.196
Chris, I'd like you
to meet my fiance, Carl.

16:03.198 --> 16:04.864
- Well.
- Hi, there.

16:04.866 --> 16:06.949
Hi.
How did you two meet?

16:06.951 --> 16:07.950
Whitewater rafting.

16:07.952 --> 16:09.819
He was
the young rafting instructor

16:09.821 --> 16:11.070
all the girls
were into,

16:11.072 --> 16:12.655
and I was
the young rafting instructor

16:12.657 --> 16:13.790
all the guys were into...

16:13.792 --> 16:15.524
And then we got together.

16:15.526 --> 16:17.193
Ah, so random, right?

16:17.195 --> 16:20.463
What a story! I felt like
my heart was whitewater rafting.

16:20.465 --> 16:22.248
Well, I won't keep you guys.

16:22.250 --> 16:23.549
It's good to see you.
Mwah.

16:23.551 --> 16:25.968
Oh, little tip,
there is fat in the eggnog.

16:25.970 --> 16:27.303
Okay.

16:27.805 --> 16:29.889
So how'd it go?
You okay?

16:31.393 --> 16:32.875
I'm fine.

16:32.877 --> 16:34.394
If therapy
has taught me anything,

16:34.396 --> 16:36.212
it's that I need
to face my fears,

16:36.214 --> 16:38.898
even when my fears
are engaged to a man

16:38.900 --> 16:41.567
with the chiseled jawline
of a young me.

16:41.569 --> 16:43.019
Thank you, Ben.

16:43.021 --> 16:44.187
Thank me?
For what?

16:44.189 --> 16:46.389
For looking out for me
tonight.

16:46.391 --> 16:47.907
You're a good friend.

16:48.409 --> 16:50.443
Hey...

16:50.445 --> 16:52.228
So Gayle and Jerry--

16:52.230 --> 16:54.947
I've thought about it a lot.
There's no logical explanation.

16:58.453 --> 17:00.286
Well, hello there,
Big B--

17:00.288 --> 17:03.756
Gross! Leslie?
Where's Ron?

17:03.758 --> 17:05.425
Too late, Tammy.
Ron's gone.

17:05.426 --> 17:06.742
You'll never get him back.

17:06.743 --> 17:09.512
Wanna bet?
That relationship is weak.

17:09.513 --> 17:12.932
All I have to do is find Ron
within the next few hours,

17:12.934 --> 17:14.416
and he's toast.

17:14.419 --> 17:17.086
Few hours, you say?

17:17.088 --> 17:18.137
Leslie!

17:18.138 --> 17:19.856
Stop this car!
Where are we going?

17:19.858 --> 17:21.357
I don't know.

17:21.358 --> 17:23.425
You're gonna
regret this!

17:25.095 --> 17:26.229
Well, hello again.

17:26.231 --> 17:27.896
You ready
to be nice to Jerry?

17:27.898 --> 17:30.116
Because it's so cold
out here,

17:30.418 --> 17:32.235
it reminds me
of my wife's lasagna.

17:32.237 --> 17:34.103
I actually
like that one.

17:34.105 --> 17:36.572
Hey, guys!
I thought you weren't coming.

17:36.574 --> 17:38.708
I--you know,
never got your RSVP.

17:38.710 --> 17:41.961
Hi, Jerry. We got you a gift.
Merry Christmas.

17:41.963 --> 17:43.246
Yeah, just--

17:43.248 --> 17:45.281
we took up a collection
to pay your hospital bills,

17:45.283 --> 17:48.134
since you almost
farted yourself to death.

17:48.136 --> 17:49.585
Every time
we did something mean,

17:49.587 --> 17:51.454
we put a dollar
in a box.

17:51.456 --> 17:54.424
Wow. I'm the luckiest man
on earth.

17:54.926 --> 17:57.009
Okay, well, come on in!
It's a party.

18:02.766 --> 18:05.101
Uh--
Oh, jeez.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.687
- Give me the keys!
- No!

18:07.689 --> 18:09.939
- Give 'em to me!
- Never!

18:09.941 --> 18:11.991
Hey,
game over, Tammy.

18:11.993 --> 18:14.777
- What? You--!
- Ah!

18:14.779 --> 18:16.479
I'm going in!

18:21.503 --> 18:23.870
Oh, my God,
I am so turned on right now.

18:23.872 --> 18:25.455
What is wrong
with you?

18:25.457 --> 18:27.089
Oh, yeah, tell me
you're not feeling this.

18:27.091 --> 18:28.591
You are so crazy!

18:28.593 --> 18:29.842
I got 'em!

18:29.844 --> 18:30.927
- I got 'em.
- No!

18:32.347 --> 18:33.596
- No!
- Ah!

18:33.598 --> 18:34.764
You'll never catch me!

18:34.766 --> 18:36.382
Come back here-- Ow!

18:36.384 --> 18:37.550
You are not

18:37.552 --> 18:38.634
gonna ruin this night!

18:38.636 --> 18:40.102
- Get away from this car!
- No!

18:40.604 --> 18:41.938
What are you doing?

18:41.940 --> 18:43.306
You're crazy!

18:43.308 --> 18:46.008
Ron! Ron!
Ha!

18:46.010 --> 18:47.009
You're too late!

18:48.313 --> 18:51.113
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:52.115 --> 18:55.885
She just knows you so well,
and I was starting to wonder

18:55.887 --> 18:57.703
if I was ever
gonna get to that point.

18:57.995 --> 18:59.739
I'm worried
that maybe

18:59.741 --> 19:01.958
there isn't room in your life
for another woman.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.911
At this very moment,
Leslie is throwing herself

19:04.913 --> 19:08.998
in front of a freight train
named Tammy for me and you.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.551
Leslie is a wonderful,
loyal friend,

19:11.553 --> 19:13.503
who is very important
in my life,

19:13.505 --> 19:15.805
but I would sooner
visit Europe

19:15.807 --> 19:18.391
than have something romantic
happen between us.

19:18.393 --> 19:21.877
Although,
if you'd like to visit Europe,

19:21.879 --> 19:24.347
I like you so much,
I'd be willing to risk it.

19:24.949 --> 19:27.149
But not France,
right?

19:27.151 --> 19:28.184
God, no.

19:30.388 --> 19:32.855
See? You know me
pretty well already,

19:32.857 --> 19:35.992
but you're about to
get to know me even better.

19:35.994 --> 19:38.661
I brought you here because
I want to show you something

19:38.663 --> 19:40.530
that almost no one
knows about--

19:40.532 --> 19:44.083
certainly not Tammy,
and not even Leslie Knope.

19:44.085 --> 19:47.670
Ladies and gentleman,
and especially the ladies,

19:47.672 --> 19:50.840
put your hands together
for the one, the only,

19:50.842 --> 19:53.909
my man,
Mr. Duke Silver.

19:57.799 --> 20:00.633
A mighty fine holiday evening
to you all.

20:00.635 --> 20:03.886
- Yeah.
- It might be cold outside,

20:03.888 --> 20:07.223
but it's about to get warm
all up in my jazz.

20:08.226 --> 20:10.276
I, of course,
am Duke Silver,

20:10.278 --> 20:13.262
and I would like
to dedicate this first song...

20:13.264 --> 20:14.597
To my duchess.

20:19.937 --> 20:21.954
You're so lucky.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.492
I'm going to kill you.

20:32.116 --> 20:34.950
I think it's time
to officially retire

20:34.952 --> 20:37.953
as Ron's emotional guardian.
That's Diane's job now,

20:37.955 --> 20:40.289
and she seems
more than up to the task.

20:40.291 --> 20:42.975
I mean,
I'd do anything for Ron--

20:42.977 --> 20:46.462
even spend a whole night
fighting his crazy ex-wife.

20:46.764 --> 20:50.466
But I think I'm safe.
She's gotta be tired by now.

20:50.468 --> 20:51.484
Hi.

20:52.568 --> 20:58.584

20:59.070 --> 21:01.054
- Officer Skorggel.
- I pulled over

21:01.155 --> 21:04.407
a Tammy Swanson
for driving erratically.

21:04.458 --> 21:06.225
Ran the plates,
saw it was your car.

21:06.660 --> 21:07.727
Figured it was stolen.

21:07.861 --> 21:09.696
Hey, Ron, why don't you
get me out of these handcuffs,

21:09.714 --> 21:12.198
so I can put you
into these handcuffs.

21:12.216 --> 21:14.601
Yes, please officer,
get her out of those cuffs.

21:14.635 --> 21:16.035
I want this
to be a fair fight.

21:16.554 --> 21:19.539
Officer, did you see
any sign of a passenger?

21:20.957 --> 21:22.041
Ron!

21:22.176 --> 21:23.109
There we go.

21:23.394 --> 21:24.794
Hey!

21:27.994 --> 21:29.194
Help.
