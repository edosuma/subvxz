What are you talking about?

00:11.402 --> 00:15.493
Look at you. You're so...
My birth mother is dead.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.104
I may not be
the freshest daisy
in the garden,

00:17.147 --> 00:18.453
but, hey, I'm still breathing.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.237
Take your hands off her!
Calm down!

00:20.281 --> 00:24.328
Why am I on your wall?
Who are you, really?
Answer the question.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.071
Come on.
Answer the question!

00:28.115 --> 00:30.334
It says "McNair."
It's Chandris.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.294
Chandris.
McNair's my married name.

00:33.337 --> 00:36.166
Look, December 9th, 1980.
That's the night I had you.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.473
I said,
take your hands off her!TOMMY: Shut up!

00:38.516 --> 00:39.822
It snowed something awful
that night.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.216
Congratulations.
You looked up my birthday.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.305
No, I know
a lot more than that.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.357
Let's get 'em out of here...
Don't do this.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.098
They're gonna find me!
Turn around, God damn it!

00:55.142 --> 00:56.056
Emily, please!
TOMMY: Come on, let's go.
You're under arrest.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.448
Come on.
VALERIE: No, please.

00:57.492 --> 01:00.016
Just let me get my bag.
I need my bag.

01:50.719 --> 01:55.071
Canto, Durand, Isaac,
Gunnarsen. My office, now!

02:16.788 --> 02:18.573
We need to start
ruling things out.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.402
NICK: I spoke with SIOC.
Real time,
they've got nothing.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.665
Just typical post-event
Internet activity.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.623
But going over their
cast surveillance,

02:25.667 --> 02:27.625
they've identified
five extremist groups

02:27.669 --> 02:29.627
with increased chatter
in the last month.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.890
And Counterterrorism
sent over their own list.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.763
Three groups are on both,
The New England Light Foots,

02:34.806 --> 02:37.113
Patriotic Guardians,
and Righteous Resistance.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.420
I want surveillance
on the leaders
of all three groups,

02:39.463 --> 02:41.857
all source analysis
round the clock.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.076
You haven't ruled out
a lone wolf, I hope.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.861
Because this
is a Federal building,

02:45.904 --> 02:47.602
we're jumping
to an anarchist theory,

02:47.645 --> 02:49.865
but consider that FEMA,
Veterans' Affairs,

02:49.908 --> 02:51.954
hell, all the agencies
in that building

02:51.997 --> 02:53.869
have had layoffs in the
past 12 months.

02:53.912 --> 02:56.350
Someone got fired
and has a grudge.

02:56.393 --> 02:59.788
Lone wolf terrorists are often
motivated by extreme stress
and problems at work.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.703
Maybe it's one of us, then.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.967
A few minutes ago,
you were talking about groups.

03:05.010 --> 03:08.100
We can't rule things out
until we're certain.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.929
Then get certain.
Go. Now.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.936
TOMMY: I've got them
on a 48-hour hold.

03:17.980 --> 03:20.156
EMILY:
That's more than enough.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.505
TOMMY:
What are you looking for?

03:21.549 --> 03:23.986
EMILY: Anything that
proves her story.

03:24.029 --> 03:25.379
What would she get
out of pretending?

03:25.422 --> 03:29.034
I don't know.
I thought she was dead.

03:57.149 --> 03:59.456

Yeah, let's go.

Let's move.

05:37.598 --> 05:40.035
NICK:
You know what it was like?

05:40.078 --> 05:43.691
Do you remember those
Chernobyl pictures?

05:43.734 --> 05:47.477
Those frozen moments,
all the clocks stopped.

05:49.087 --> 05:52.743
Everybody just gone.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.834
I had a woman scream
at me earlier.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.097
Her husband had just died
and she was freaking out

05:59.141 --> 06:01.317
because no one would
validate her parking.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.581
Sometimes, people need
someone to scream at.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.061
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.542
Something will eventually,
you know...

06:08.585 --> 06:10.718
Yeah, you're right.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.546

06:12.589 --> 06:15.244

to the nurses' station.

Um...

06:16.767 --> 06:18.247
I got... I have to go.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.075
I'll call you back later.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.208
What is it?

06:33.436 --> 06:37.048
It's a Yellow Jacket XQ socket
bit used in HVAC applications,

06:37.092 --> 06:39.268
same size as the bolts
removed from the air handler.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.836
Anybody working in the area
could have dropped this.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.881
It's shiny.
It was used maybe once.

06:43.925 --> 06:47.319
You know any tradesmen that
would leave a brand-new
specialized bit behind?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.452
Okay. Go get a list
of every recent purchase

06:49.496 --> 06:51.454
of a Yellow Jacket
XQ socket bit

06:51.498 --> 06:54.805
from every hardware store
in the area. Go. Go.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.999
I gotta go back.
I'll call you up later.Yeah, okay.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.088
Hey! Hey, where you going?

07:17.132 --> 07:19.221
I just got you out.
I got questions for you.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.266
We need to go somewhere safe.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.617
We're in front
of a police station.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.662
They got me in the system.
I need to get out of here now.

07:25.706 --> 07:28.360

talking about? Who's "they"?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.841
Not now.
They're coming any second.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.310
It's 10:00 in the morning.

Well, I'm having
an emotional moment.

08:29.683 --> 08:32.076

08:32.120 --> 08:34.949
I'm not having
an emotional moment.

Is that your son's room?
It's Flynn, yeah?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.920
Why were you following me?

08:49.964 --> 08:52.749
I saw you in the RV park.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.969
So, why didn't you just
tell me who you were?

08:55.012 --> 08:57.928
I didn't know how to begin,
and to be honest,

08:57.972 --> 09:03.499
you didn't really look
like you were ready to welcome
any long-lost family members.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.981
So, now,
after all these years,
you come and find me?

09:07.024 --> 09:08.939
No. You found me.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.419
It's a sign.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.594
What do you mean?

09:13.944 --> 09:17.208
I think maybe,
someone's trying
to get me, too.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.735
Okay. Describe 'em.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.868
I never know it's them
until it's too late.

Valerie, you're not
making any sense.That's part of it.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.746
It's like,
they give me something,
and then I don't remember.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.229
What have you been doing
for the past six years?

09:38.273 --> 09:41.276
Prison.
Some of the time, anyway.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.322
So, why would anyone
be after you?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.063
Why were they after you?

09:46.107 --> 09:49.414
This is about you, Valerie.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.895
Why do you think
you were being followed?

09:51.939 --> 09:53.462
I don't know.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.377
When did you start noticing
that you were being followed?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.031
I don't know.
I don't know. I...

09:57.074 --> 09:58.902
Just give me something
to believe.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.296
Describe one moment
when you were being followed.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.428
I can't remember. I'm sorry.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.824
You gotta leave.
What?

10:07.868 --> 10:10.479
My story
was all over the news.
I bet it was exciting.

10:10.522 --> 10:13.961
Somewhere along the lines,
our stories blurred
and fiction becomes fact.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.615
No, no, no. I am not leaving.

to get out of my apartment

10:17.486 --> 10:18.748
before I get my gun.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.576
You think I've never
had a gun pointed at me?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.926
Go ahead, get it.
I am not going back out there.

for something? Oh, God.

What woman?

11:06.709 --> 11:10.452
It doesn't matter.
Listen, she started
having trouble talking.

11:10.495 --> 11:13.890
She was sweating
and stuttering,
and then she passed out.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.326
How old is she?

11:16.414 --> 11:17.459
Do you know her?

11:17.502 --> 11:18.590
No.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.551
I'm going through her bag
right now.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.814
Check what's inside.
She might have some pills.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.387
What's NovoLog Mix 70/30?

11:32.430 --> 11:33.867
It's insulin.
She's probably a diabetic.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.390
You're gonna have to
give her a shot.

11:36.783 --> 11:41.004
Got it.
Okay, where do I inject her?

11:41.048 --> 11:44.573
Abdomen's the fastest.
Pinch one or two inches
of skin.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.010
Stay away from the navel,
at least a couple inches.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.185
Got it.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.709
Inject at a 90-degree angle
to the skin.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.623
Okay. Hold on.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.868

your injection.

She's getting her insulin
from the black market.

15:25.098 --> 15:28.144
Do you know how dangerous
that is?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.755
Do you have anyone
at the hospital
you can talk to?

15:30.799 --> 15:32.801
[SCOFFS] Unbelievable.
What?

15:32.844 --> 15:34.020
I'm just starting
to get things back,

15:34.063 --> 15:35.935
and you're asking me
to risk it all?

15:35.978 --> 15:39.286
No, I'm not.
I swear. I'm sorry.

15:40.113 --> 15:45.770
So, who is she? Really.

15:45.814 --> 15:51.211
She's a witness in one of
Tommy's cases, and he needs
to keep her here for a day.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.264
Okay. We need to keep
her blood sugar up.

16:02.526 --> 16:05.007
Do you have any milk or OJ?
No.

16:05.051 --> 16:09.403
Soda?
Yeah. Mixers, I have.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.711
I gotta go back to work.
Okay.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.064
Thank you.

16:55.405 --> 16:56.754
Hey.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.458
You hungry?

17:04.501 --> 17:06.764
Oh, God. Did you make that?

17:06.808 --> 17:09.637
Yeah. No, my dad did.
He's a good cook.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.511
So is my mom.

17:34.879 --> 17:38.448
Emily, I tried to contact you
when you were
in the orphanage.

17:39.406 --> 17:43.192
So, that's it? One attempt?

17:43.236 --> 17:45.760
No, no. I could've called you
1,000 times.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.109
They weren't giving
me anything.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.720
But you didn't.
I couldn't.

17:49.764 --> 17:51.331
Because you were in prison.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.595
Yeah.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.436
Hey, no, no. No.

18:11.307 --> 18:12.917
Thought it could be
a truth serum.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.492
Tell me what happened.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.846
I got caught forging a check.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.240
That, on top of an earlier
assault charge,

18:31.284 --> 18:32.937
I was going down
for a long time

18:32.981 --> 18:35.375
and I had no one
to give you to,

18:36.680 --> 18:39.030
so you were remanded
to the state.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.646
And what about the father?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.475
No one wanted
to take the credit.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.958
After a couple of years,
I got out, and I came for you.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.353
That's not in my file.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
They told me you'd gone
to a loving home.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
I figured it was for the best.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.362
It's easier that way,
isn't it?

19:06.406 --> 19:10.758
Look at you, all clean cut,
nice-looking husband.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.803
Yeah. I seen the pictures.
Ex-husband.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.893
That's even better.
You get yourself
a handsome boyfriend.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.678
Have a nice life
because you can,

19:17.721 --> 19:22.073
because I did
what I had to do,
and I let you go.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.119
I know I screwed up.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.080
but I'm trying
to help you now.

19:29.124 --> 19:33.781
Ever since
they've been after me,
I've felt scared for you.

19:33.824 --> 19:37.045
If you're just
a third-rate offender,
why would anyone be after you?

19:37.088 --> 19:39.395
I don't know,
but I am clean now,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.919
and there are certain things
I've been noticing,

19:41.963 --> 19:44.922
things that I've seen,
that I felt,

19:44.966 --> 19:46.924
and I'm telling you,
things aren't right.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.275
You gotta be more specific,
Valerie.

19:50.928 --> 19:55.759
Okay, earlier this year,
I'm doing a bit
at Farmingdale,

19:55.803 --> 19:58.371
and they take me
to get my eyes
checked 'cause of my diabetes.

19:58.414 --> 20:02.201
So, I get taken
to the Boston Mercy's
isolation ward, and bam.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.813
They give me something.
What?

20:05.856 --> 20:07.858
I don't know
what the hell it was,
but it sure wasn't insulin.

20:10.078 --> 20:13.081
And ever since then,
I don't know, I'm not right.

20:13.124 --> 20:18.478
I black out, and the guy
who treated me there...

20:20.697 --> 20:24.527
I can feel him.
You know,
he's still around me.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.498
Boston Mercy? That's where
they gave you the insulin?

20:38.541 --> 20:43.503
No. It wasn't insulin.
I told you,
they did something to me.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.461
[WATER RUNNING]
What are you doing?

20:45.505 --> 20:47.724
I have to go out for a while.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.291
I'll get you
some more insulin.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.686
For your headache, okay?

20:52.729 --> 20:56.472
Just keep the windows closed
and the door locked,
and I'll be right back, okay?

20:56.516 --> 20:59.040
No.

21:01.129 --> 21:02.173
I'll be back.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.566
Okay.
Okay.

21:21.932 --> 21:24.935
I was just spraying Permethrin like I was told, I swear.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.416
And Permethrin is what?

21:27.460 --> 21:31.202
The shit they put in our tanks to kill roaches.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.944
I only put it
around the outside.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.076
Please.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.878
We got a real
Stonewall Jackson here.

21:54.922 --> 21:57.228
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
So, this isn't the guy.

21:57.272 --> 21:59.492
No, he isn't.

21:59.535 --> 22:03.234
Hmm. And you're happy
about that?

22:03.278 --> 22:06.847
Being less wrong than you
and Crown is not a major
career goal of mine.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.678
One of us needs
to start being right.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.767
This is a process.

22:13.810 --> 22:17.466
Building a profile, tracking
evidence, arresting someone,
it should all be a process.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.469
Agreed.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.360
Thank you.

23:34.674 --> 23:35.631
Hey.

24:47.442 --> 24:48.835
Hey, guys.
MAN: Hey.

25:14.077 --> 25:15.731
Oh, God.

25:16.471 --> 25:17.472
WOMAN: Hey.

25:19.343 --> 25:20.649
Are you from the ER?

25:21.650 --> 25:22.999
Yeah.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.567
How's it going down there?

25:25.611 --> 25:28.352
It's chaos.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.311
Those poor people.
Yeah.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.052
How can I help?

25:32.095 --> 25:35.621
Well, my attending
has a patient downstairs,

25:35.664 --> 25:37.971
who apparently
was a patient up here before,

25:38.014 --> 25:39.755
and I'm supposed
to get her file.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.975
Sure. Use this computer.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.673
Thanks.

26:43.645 --> 26:48.998
So, apparently,
she had a dilated eye exam,
retinopathy negative.

26:49.042 --> 26:52.349
Yeah. She's probably diabetic.
Yeah, yeah, she is.

26:52.393 --> 26:55.570
And then all of her
blood work was sent
to Catalyst Diagnostics.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
Routine analysis.
Mmm-hmm.

27:00.009 --> 27:03.099
Haloperidol? Is that normal
for an eye exam?

27:03.143 --> 27:04.971
Well, it is a sedative.

27:05.014 --> 27:08.017
So if she was behaving
aggressively, maybe.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.889
Yeah. Yeah.

27:11.151 --> 27:15.503
So, all in all,
it looks a routine visit, huh?

27:15.546 --> 27:17.244
Seems like.

27:20.073 --> 27:21.683
Thank you.

27:22.728 --> 27:26.253
Hang on. You can't leave
with that.

27:29.299 --> 27:31.911
I'll put it back.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.216
Yeah, thank you.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.654
No worries.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.708
Tommy? Hey, yeah.

27:46.752 --> 27:50.233
I just saw Valerie's files
at the hospital.

27:52.888 --> 27:57.501
Either she's crazy or lying,
or both,

27:57.545 --> 28:00.069
'cause none of what she said
adds up.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.419
I just feel like an idiot
for believing her.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.467
Okay. I gotta go talk
to this nut.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.904
I'll call you after, okay?
Yeah, bye.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.177
Ooh. Thanks.
Yeah.

28:21.221 --> 28:25.007
"Socket" to me.
What?

28:25.051 --> 28:28.054
How's the socket bit hunt
coming along?

28:29.969 --> 28:33.668
There are 142 hardware stores
in the New England area,

28:33.712 --> 28:35.365
and we've narrowed it down
to 57.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.758
What if he bought online?

28:36.802 --> 28:38.978
Your report suggested
that our suspect

28:39.021 --> 28:42.329
would be smart enough not to
have supplies shipped to him.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.244
You're reading my reports.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.116
We got a long way to go.

28:52.687 --> 28:58.084
So, you were instrumental
in capturing
the stock car shooter.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.563
You could've had
your own field office.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.478
Didn't want one.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.176
Or you didn't want that one.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.010
Enjoy your coffee.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.844
Hey, good night.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.241
MANDEL: Byrne.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.069
You got a wife? Kids?

29:27.113 --> 29:28.288
Uh, no.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.811
Perfect. Then you can earn
some overtime.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.553
They still have us
at code yellow
in case of another attack,

29:32.596 --> 29:35.251
and second wave was more
intense than anyone predicted.

29:35.295 --> 29:36.862
We need all the help
we can get.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.472
Whatever you need, Chief.

29:38.515 --> 29:42.084
I read the report on your
pulmonary edema call
the other night.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.129
Good work.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.697

my training, doing my job.

29:46.741 --> 29:49.570

this might lead?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.287
Yeah, I am.

You?

30:15.291 --> 30:16.684
Same.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.471
It's kinda wrong, isn't it?

30:21.515 --> 30:22.951
Hmm? What?

30:24.170 --> 30:25.867
A hundred and twenty-one
people have died,

30:25.911 --> 30:27.434
and you and I have
a new lease on life.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.920
You're free to go, Mr. Deleon.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.660
You're shitting me.

30:36.704 --> 30:38.314
You arrest me
in front of the world,

30:38.358 --> 30:39.925
keep me here for hours,
and that's it?

30:40.621 --> 30:42.014
We didn't arrest you.

30:42.057 --> 30:45.060

and put me in handcuffs.

everything's
all over the Internet.

for a few weeks.

because their insides
were turning to liquid.

the wrong Federal building.

I got this profiler
in from D.C.

They're gonna put me
on the bench, I know it.

31:38.113 --> 31:42.465
On the bright side,
SprayGon will probably
have an opening.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.685
You pushed me into this guy.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.513
I can shape my follow-up,

31:46.556 --> 31:50.473
so it's clear Miles
was brought in
only for his own safety.

31:50.517 --> 31:54.260
I don't want you
shaping stories, Erica.

something like that?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.614
and they gave you a sedative
to calm you down.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.225
That doesn't make sense.
Yeah, it does.

34:13.268 --> 34:16.271
No.
Yeah, it makes sense
to everyone except for you.

34:17.751 --> 34:20.884
You actually had me
believing your story,

34:20.928 --> 34:23.365
like I was the one
who had done something wrong.

34:23.974 --> 34:25.019
No, Emily.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.282
Back off, man. Just back off.

34:29.067 --> 34:34.202
I am not letting my problems
endanger my kid. Not again.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.640
Leave.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.602
Yeah, I get it.

34:46.954 --> 34:48.434
Be safe.

35:04.667 --> 35:05.799
Flynn?

35:09.542 --> 35:13.459
Flynn? Hey.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.944
Sorry.

35:20.988 --> 35:24.252
I forgot you were coming over.
I'm not used
to this schedule yet.

35:25.645 --> 35:28.778
So, she's my grandmother?

35:28.822 --> 35:32.956
No. Your grandmother
is Helen Byrne,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.873
the woman who made
your baby blanket for you.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.835
But she's your mom?

35:41.878 --> 35:43.010
Yeah.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.535
I just met her, too.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.061
Is she gonna be back?

35:52.715 --> 35:55.762
You have nothing
to worry about.
You know that, right?

35:57.416 --> 36:01.115
She's kind of a mess, I know,
but we'll figure it out.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.077
Yeah.

36:36.324 --> 36:38.413
Em, what a pleasant surprise.

36:44.202 --> 36:49.555
I just met my birth mom.
She has everything.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.252
My birth certificate,
photos, everything.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.949
It's her.
It's Valerie Chandris.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.037
Valerie?

36:55.996 --> 36:58.259
When did she come back?

37:08.400 --> 37:10.489
Why didn't you tell me
about her?

37:12.142 --> 37:13.796
I thought she was long gone.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.755
You said she was dead.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.061
For all intents
and purposes,
she was.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.761
How much did you guys
know about her?

37:21.804 --> 37:23.980
Enough to know
she should be kept away.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.765
Dad?
She's dangerous.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.202
I saw her rap sheet.
Fighting with other inmates.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.769
Did she tell you
she was in solitary?

37:29.812 --> 37:31.379
No.
She's not good for you,

37:31.423 --> 37:33.120
or for Flynn.
So, you were afraid

37:33.163 --> 37:35.601
that I would what,
find her and then become her?

37:35.644 --> 37:37.994
If you were in our position,
you wouldn't have taken
that chance either.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.344
Dad, you lied to me.

37:39.387 --> 37:41.084
I don't get it!
Why did the hell

37:41.128 --> 37:42.651
did you go looking for her
after all this time?

37:42.695 --> 37:44.871
I didn't go looking for her.
She found me!

37:44.914 --> 37:46.655
You need to close that door!

37:46.699 --> 37:48.875
I can't just pretend
that this didn't happen.

37:48.918 --> 37:52.357
Don't expect me to run down
this rat hole with you.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.010
You have a family.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.797
You want to choose her?

37:58.580 --> 37:59.842
Get out.

38:02.541 --> 38:04.107
Get out!

38:17.077 --> 38:21.821
I got the whiskey.
I got the snowballs.
We're gonna party tonight.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.394
So, listen,
I need your brain.

38:29.437 --> 38:33.267
Got a new body, a gangbanger.
Want to guess how he died?

38:34.573 --> 38:37.097
Glock 40? Nine mil?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.968
None of the above.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.710
It was a hot shot of Fentanyl.
It's crazy, right?

38:41.754 --> 38:45.584
Tommy, I didn't call you here
to talk about cases, okay?

38:45.627 --> 38:47.020
What happened
with your mom?

38:47.063 --> 38:48.848
I don't want
to talk about her.

38:48.891 --> 38:50.937
I don't want to talk
about any of that.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.028
Do you wanna fuck, or not?

39:05.691 --> 39:08.041
Yeah. Yeah.

39:32.195 --> 39:33.719
[GASPS] No!
