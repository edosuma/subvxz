-[door opening]
-[keys jangling]

00:27.767 --> 00:29.033
[man] Time.

00:47.767 --> 00:48.800
[door buzzes]

01:09.600 --> 01:11.133
[clerk] All rise.

01:27.633 --> 01:30.600
[clerk] Will
the foreman stand, please?

01:30.633 --> 01:34.167
Have you reached a verdict
on which at least
ten of you agree?

01:34.200 --> 01:37.167
-[foreman] No.
-[judge] Do you think
if I gave you any more time,

01:37.200 --> 01:40.267
you would be able
to reach a verdict on which
at least ten of you agreed?

01:42.467 --> 01:45.300
-No. I'm sorry.
-[indistinct chattering]

01:45.333 --> 01:49.033
In which case, I'm obliged
to call the trial to a halt

01:49.067 --> 01:51.567
and discharge you, the jury.

01:51.600 --> 01:56.233
And having consulted with
the prosecution in anticipation
of such an outcome,

01:56.267 --> 01:58.200
it is my duty
to tell you, Mr. Collins,

01:58.233 --> 02:02.667
the prosecution intend
to offer no further evidence.

02:02.700 --> 02:06.633
And as such,
given this was the third trial
for the same offence,

02:06.667 --> 02:10.600
you are now formally acquitted
of all charges
and are free to leave.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.800
[indistinct chattering]

02:13.833 --> 02:17.167
[judge]
Court will now adjourn.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.400
You killed my sister,
you bastard! You murdered
my sister! [whimpering]

02:24.800 --> 02:26.467
[woman crying]

02:36.800 --> 02:38.833
[man]
How you feeling, Alice?

02:38.867 --> 02:41.233
What about your brother-in-law,
Mrs. Moffatt?

02:41.267 --> 02:44.333
[woman] Do you still think
he did it, Alice?

02:46.600 --> 02:49.100
-Do you still think he did it?
-[man] Can we go, please,
driver?

02:49.133 --> 02:52.367
[indistinct chattering]

02:52.400 --> 02:55.267
[woman] DCI Beech,
what is your reaction
to Mr. Collins' release?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.600
My thoughts right now are
with Tara Collins' family,

02:57.633 --> 03:00.267
-her mum, her dad, her sister.
-Do you have any new leads?

03:00.300 --> 03:02.333
We'll be reviewing
all the evidence we have.
Excuse me.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.067
Are there any other suspects?

03:04.100 --> 03:05.500
Will, are you looking
for anyone else?

03:05.533 --> 03:07.033
No, we're not looking
for anyone else.

03:07.067 --> 03:10.333
[clamouring]

03:19.833 --> 03:22.633
[sighs]

03:22.667 --> 03:25.700
Okay, I'm going to get our car
to come round the back.

03:25.733 --> 03:27.767
It's insane out there.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.133
Come on.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.367
David?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.433
No. No.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.633
-Dave. Dave!
-[door opens]

03:44.667 --> 03:46.667
[clamouring]

03:51.067 --> 03:53.833
[woman]
What would you like to say
to your sister-in-law, David?

03:53.867 --> 03:55.800
[man] What would you like
to say to Tara's family?

03:55.833 --> 03:57.667
[man 2] Will you
be suing Mrs. Moffatt?

03:57.700 --> 04:00.233
Have you spoken
to your children?

04:00.267 --> 04:04.333
Seven years ago,
I was sent to prison for
something that I did not do.

04:04.367 --> 04:09.133
For, uh, a terrible crime
that I did not commit.

04:09.167 --> 04:13.233
Overnight, I lost my wife,

04:13.267 --> 04:18.433
I lost my liberty,
and most importantly,
I lost my kids.

04:19.833 --> 04:22.100
Why?

04:22.133 --> 04:26.600
Because of the Forensic Science
Service's criminal negligence

04:26.633 --> 04:28.700
and because
of a police investigation

04:28.733 --> 04:31.467
that bent
every bit of evidence

04:31.500 --> 04:34.833
to fit a theory
that was clearly wrong.

04:34.867 --> 04:39.233
And more important than that,
much worse...

04:39.267 --> 04:41.367
was that ordinary people lied.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.233
They lied
for their own ends.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.733
And if they
are watching this now,

04:45.767 --> 04:48.433
then I want them to know
that I will expose them.

04:48.467 --> 04:52.333
I will expose them for what
they have put me through.

04:52.367 --> 04:57.500
I've had seven years
of my life stolen,
and now I want justice.

04:57.533 --> 05:01.233
I want my wife's
real killer found.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.833
I want those that lied
brought to book.

05:04.867 --> 05:08.400
And I want my children back.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.633
-[man] Thank you, David.
-[woman] Where will you live,
Mr. Collins?

05:10.667 --> 05:13.433
Mr. Collins would like
to get home. Thank you.
No more questions.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.833
Excuse me. Thank you.
Excuse me.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.267
No more questions.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.333
[theme music playing]

05:32.300 --> 05:34.333
[birds chirping]

05:40.067 --> 05:43.300
[man] We should have been honest
with the children.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.100
We should have told them
this was a possibility.

05:45.133 --> 05:47.700
What would we have said, Rob?

05:47.733 --> 05:49.433
Just what?

05:52.367 --> 05:55.167
[birds chirping]

05:55.200 --> 05:59.133
-[indistinct chattering]
-[telephone ringing]

05:59.167 --> 06:02.033
It's not just a question
of having an open mind,
DCI Beech.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.633
We have to be seen
to have one.

06:03.667 --> 06:07.667
It was a stupid thing
to say, obviously.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.567
It's just that we all know
he was released
on a technicality, so...

06:12.600 --> 06:17.233
I've never worked
on a case that explored
more possibilities, sir.

06:17.267 --> 06:21.433
-There was no one else.
It was him.
-Well, I hope so.

06:21.467 --> 06:25.367
The public hardly need
another reason
to distrust us, do they?

06:25.400 --> 06:30.433
Which is why I know
you'll understand my need now
for a fresher pair of eyes.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.500
[telephone ringing]

06:43.500 --> 06:45.533
[telephone ringing]

06:45.567 --> 06:48.400
DI Hudson.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.467
Yes, sir.

07:00.133 --> 07:06.033
-No. No, no, no. [sobs]
-It's all right, darling.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.167
[girl] Why, Mum? Why?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.633
[sobs]

07:13.833 --> 07:17.600
[news reporter]
In March 2015, the Forensic
Science Service laboratory,

07:17.633 --> 07:20.167
which handled
the original evidence,

07:20.200 --> 07:24.633
was found to have routinely
broken standard
storage protocols,

07:24.667 --> 07:27.300
making it impossible
for the court to discount

07:27.333 --> 07:29.567
cross-contamination
that took place.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.700
With this, the third
such collapsed trial...

07:31.733 --> 07:34.200
-Louise.
-[Louise]  So I presume
you've seen the news.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.267
[TV]
...government ministers...

07:36.300 --> 07:39.133
[Louise] Why don't you come
over later, see the kids?

07:39.167 --> 07:41.633
-We can have a chat.
-[sighs]

07:41.667 --> 07:45.600
So I want you to pick a team
completely unconnected
to the original investigation,

07:45.633 --> 07:48.267
and then I want you
to start again,

07:48.300 --> 07:51.833
to investigate this case
as if she were killed yesterday.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.667
You think you can do that?

07:53.700 --> 07:56.167
Yes, sir. Why not?

07:56.200 --> 08:00.100
Oh, there are about 50 reasons
why not walking the corridors

08:00.133 --> 08:03.033
of this station alone,
DI Hudson.

08:03.067 --> 08:06.633
But we need to send a message
out that despite DCI Beech's
remarks this morning,

08:06.667 --> 08:09.133
we take the court's decision
very seriously, indeed.

08:09.167 --> 08:12.200
-Yes, sir, of course.
-Good.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.200
And keep me up to speed
on any new developments.

08:14.233 --> 08:16.167
I got the home office
breathing down my neck.

08:26.133 --> 08:28.200
[girl] What about
the other evidence?

08:28.233 --> 08:31.333
[Rob] Well, in the end,
the jury must have decided

08:31.367 --> 08:33.833
that the other stuff
was just too circumstantial.

08:33.867 --> 08:37.467
-What's circumstantial?
-Well, it means that, uh,

08:37.500 --> 08:39.433
it was helpful
for the original case,

08:39.467 --> 08:42.033
but not, on its own,
enough to prove guilt.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.167
-But her blood was on his coat.
-It was.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.733
But the jury believed it might
have got there by accident,

08:48.767 --> 08:51.667
at the forensic laboratory.

08:51.700 --> 08:56.700
But what about
all the other stuff he did
to her, hitting her,

08:56.733 --> 08:58.367
-and the threats he made to you?
-Again, darling,

08:58.400 --> 09:01.333
it doesn't prove
that he murdered anybody.

09:01.367 --> 09:05.033
What was he talking about
when he said people had lied?

09:05.067 --> 09:08.533
Well, if he wants people
to believe him,

09:08.567 --> 09:11.200
he's going to have to say
we all lied, isn't he?

09:11.233 --> 09:13.067
Did you?

09:13.100 --> 09:15.367
Of course not, Jack.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.433
So you still think he did it?

09:17.467 --> 09:20.633
Well, you know...
in the end, you know,

09:20.667 --> 09:24.433
I think it's probably best
not to dwell on our own
opinions, I think.

09:24.467 --> 09:29.533
The truth is,
we'll probably never know
one way or the other.

09:29.567 --> 09:31.833
-This is all fucked up.
-Jack, Jack,
I know this must be--

09:31.867 --> 09:34.667
Just leave him, love.
Just let him have
some time on his own.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.433
[Rosie] What's to stop him
just taking us back?

09:37.467 --> 09:39.600
Lots, Rosie,
there is lots to stop him.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.633
I bet he's gone to live
with Uncle Phil.

09:41.667 --> 09:44.067
-It's only 15 minutes away.
-No, no, no.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.567
-He could come and take us...
-That's not going to happen.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.333
...when we're outside school.

09:47.367 --> 09:48.533
-It's okay. It's okay.
-And he killed our mum

09:48.567 --> 09:51.267
and he could kill us.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.167
-[Rosie crying]
-[gasps]

09:58.133 --> 10:00.200
[sombre music playing]

10:59.867 --> 11:01.167
I'm so sorry.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.400
[Phil] Here we go.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.733
How long you been here?

11:25.767 --> 11:28.467
Uh, 'bout six months.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.733
Well, the old place was
too big, really,

11:36.767 --> 11:42.067
and, um, well, your case
took up a fair amount of time.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.400
Both gave me the excuse
to chuck in my shite job,

11:44.433 --> 11:48.800
and, uh, well, to take one
that I actually enjoy.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.467
For which, my dear brother,
I am eternally grateful.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.433
[waves crashing]

12:09.533 --> 12:14.333
Sorry, um, [stammers]
I didn't know
how today was gonna go.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.333
Obviously, I'll clear
all this out now.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.767
-Phil.
-Shut up.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.200
I don't know how I'm ever gonna
be able to thank you.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.767
You would have done
the same for me.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.833
Nah, I bloody wouldn't have.
[laughs]

12:39.867 --> 12:41.433
[scoffs]

12:49.133 --> 12:50.167
Right. [clears throat]

12:51.767 --> 12:54.333
Yeah, [stammers]
I'm gonna stick the kettle on.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.067
There's a few boxes of stuff
from your old house there,

13:00.100 --> 13:03.267
I managed to get it in
before Alice took everything.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.567
-Are they still
just outside Halesham?
-Yeah.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.200
I drive over
every now and then just...
just to see the kids.

13:13.233 --> 13:16.500
See-- See them?
Have you... Have you
spoken to them, Phil?

13:16.533 --> 13:20.367
No, no, from a distance.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.100
I've taken a few photos
over the years.
They're in there too.

13:23.133 --> 13:24.167
In here?

13:25.333 --> 13:26.500
Milk and sugar?

13:36.833 --> 13:38.333
[indistinct chattering]

13:41.633 --> 13:44.667
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.667
Listen, I had no idea
he was gonna give me the case.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.200
-I know.
-And obviously, I've got
no choice about whether--

13:49.233 --> 13:52.300
-I had to say yes.
-Hey, it's all right,
it's all right.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.500
-[sighs]
-I'm pleased for you.
Of course I am.

13:55.533 --> 13:58.667
And I'm here for you,
if you need any help. Genuinely.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.633
-Listen, he knows
you got it right.
-Does he?

14:01.667 --> 14:05.067
Didn't sound it to me.
[sighs]

14:05.100 --> 14:07.500
Jesus, maybe there
is someone else out there.
Maybe I did get it wrong.

14:07.533 --> 14:12.800
No, no, you didn't get
anything wrong. You know that.
Everyone knows that.

14:12.833 --> 14:16.433
I'm just gonna do what I'm told
and do what's required of me,

14:16.467 --> 14:18.633
and I have absolutely no doubt,

14:18.667 --> 14:20.433
that I will come to exactly
the same conclusion

14:20.467 --> 14:23.033
that you did
seven years ago, okay?

14:25.133 --> 14:28.400
Everything's going
to be fine, babe. [chuckles]

14:31.267 --> 14:34.533
Hm. Look.

14:34.567 --> 14:39.067
These arrived this morning.
I thought maybe we could have
a look over the weekend.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.233
-Okay.
-If you're about?

14:40.267 --> 14:43.033
-Yeah.
-Um...

14:43.067 --> 14:44.633
-That's nice.
-That is nice.

14:44.667 --> 14:47.100
-Only two bedrooms though.
-Yeah, and it's...

14:47.133 --> 14:48.167
A bit far away.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.367
[sobs]

15:37.067 --> 15:38.500
[sighs]

15:43.700 --> 15:46.033
[phone ringing]

15:46.067 --> 15:50.033
Steve, Mari Luz.
Can I see you both
in here, please?

15:50.067 --> 15:51.400
Graham, can I see you as well?

16:02.500 --> 16:05.700
So, these are copies
of the original
Tara Collins case file.

16:05.733 --> 16:10.667
Please take one each, digest,
and then tomorrow first thing,
we start again.

16:10.700 --> 16:15.667
And just... We're probably
not gonna find anything
which puts Collins back inside.

16:15.700 --> 16:19.333
The CPS have never sanctioned
a fourth trial
for the same offence,

16:19.367 --> 16:24.067
but what we might find,
if we give this
our very best efforts,

16:24.100 --> 16:26.267
is evidence which proves,
conclusively this time,

16:26.300 --> 16:28.833
what actually happened
that night.

16:28.867 --> 16:34.133
And I think we owe
Tara's family that,
at the very least. Okay.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.200
Thanks, guys.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.667
Sorry, I expected you earlier.
They're both asleep now.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.100
Took me back, watching
all those news reports.

16:57.633 --> 16:59.433
I can't manage
on what you give us, Tom.

16:59.467 --> 17:01.600
That's what the courts
decided was fair.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.633
Yeah, well, [laughs]
courts can get it wrong
though, can't they?

17:07.567 --> 17:11.133
-What were you thinking?
-Another five a year.

17:11.167 --> 17:14.433
I can't afford to pay you
another 5,000 pounds
a year, Louise.

17:14.467 --> 17:20.100
Really? But you're
a consultant now.
And all that private work?

17:20.133 --> 17:24.300
All those pretty young MILFs
who pay you to peer
between their legs.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.700
How is your new wife,
by the way?

17:27.633 --> 17:31.433
Yeah, it took me back, Tom.
Took me right back.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.133
Yes, I'm sorry to say
that, in certain circumstances,

17:43.167 --> 17:45.700
special guardianship
can be revoked.

17:45.733 --> 17:48.300
But I think the key thing here,
if it went to court,

17:48.333 --> 17:50.667
what the judge would want
to know more
than anything else,

17:50.700 --> 17:53.767
and, actually, what both sets
of parents should want to know

17:53.800 --> 17:56.533
is what do the kids want.

17:56.567 --> 17:59.400
They'll want to stay with us.
Of course they will.

17:59.433 --> 18:03.267
Okay. So you've already spoken
to them about this?

18:03.300 --> 18:05.500
Well, no, not directly.
It's all happened so fast.

18:05.533 --> 18:07.200
But we don't need to.
We just know.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.667
Yeah, they hardly remember
their father.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.633
Jack was eight,
Rosie was five.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.367
He'd be a stranger to them.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.567
All their friends are here,

18:13.600 --> 18:15.200
their family, their school.

18:15.233 --> 18:16.667
Everything's here.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.333
None of this even
takes into account

18:18.367 --> 18:19.667
what they still believe
he did, of course.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.367
Absolutely.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.733
And all of those
are very powerful arguments.

18:23.767 --> 18:26.633
But I'd also imagine
that, in time, they'll come
to accept the fact

18:26.667 --> 18:29.133
that he's been acquitted,

18:29.167 --> 18:34.700
and notwithstanding
all the other points you make,
they are still his kids.

18:34.733 --> 18:37.833
All I'm saying is,
if he does apply
for an access order,

18:37.867 --> 18:40.233
they'll take it
very seriously.

18:40.267 --> 18:45.133
And given that,
my advice to you is to start
a dialogue with him.

18:45.167 --> 18:49.033
-What, with David?
-I know that might seem
impossible right now,

18:49.067 --> 18:52.767
but trust me, going to court is
not only incredibly expensive,

18:52.800 --> 18:56.267
it's traumatic for everyone,
especially the kids.

18:56.300 --> 19:00.633
But if you can talk
and find some compromise,

19:00.667 --> 19:03.567
there might just
be a way forward
that works for everyone.

19:06.167 --> 19:10.067
I will never get over
what that man did to my family.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.033
And I want you to know

19:13.067 --> 19:16.667
that if I was ever
in the same room as him,

19:16.700 --> 19:18.533
I would try and kill him.

19:20.733 --> 19:24.000
[waves crashing]

19:39.633 --> 19:44.700
Um... I'm going to nip down
the shops to get us some grub.

19:44.733 --> 19:48.467
Is there anything
in particular you fancy?

19:48.500 --> 19:49.833
Can I go?

19:49.867 --> 19:51.067
Of course you can.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.800
And you don't have to ask.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.000
No, no, sorry,
force of habit.

20:00.100 --> 20:01.700
Here you go.

20:01.733 --> 20:06.100
And, uh, maybe grab some beers?

20:06.133 --> 20:08.567
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, and I got you this.

20:08.600 --> 20:13.233
It's, um, an old one of mine,
but should be okay.

20:13.267 --> 20:17.300
I've stuck my number in it
and, uh, your lawyer's.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.367
Right.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.400
I'm going to pay you back,
Phil, for everything.

20:23.433 --> 20:24.533
I swear.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.567
-[door opening]
-[keys jangling]

20:28.600 --> 20:31.733
Eva, I'm so sorry.
Traffic was mental.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.767
Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:51.367 --> 20:52.767
[whispering] Sorry, baby.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.167
[machine whirring]

21:31.733 --> 21:32.767
Tim?

21:34.400 --> 21:38.167
Tim, it's me, Dave.
You all right?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.433
You're my daughter's godfather.

21:51.567 --> 21:53.433
You're my friend, Tim.

21:54.633 --> 21:56.700
I'm not your friend.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.733
You have no friends.

21:58.767 --> 22:01.500
Now, fuck off back under
that stone you crawled out from.

22:10.400 --> 22:12.033
I am innocent! All right?

22:12.067 --> 22:14.367
I am innocent!
Now you fucking say it!

22:16.100 --> 22:18.433
-Say it!
-Dave! Dave! No, mate, no!

22:18.467 --> 22:21.267
-No, no, no, no, mate, no!
-I didn't get to go
to my wife's funeral!

22:21.300 --> 22:22.767
[Phil] It's all right.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.767
I saw my wife's grave
four hours ago!

22:24.800 --> 22:27.000
Let's go home.
Let's go home, Dave.
Let's go home.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.300
[Alice] We wouldn't let him
take you, Rosie, either of you.

22:35.333 --> 22:39.733
You're safe here
with Mum and Dad, always safe.

22:39.767 --> 22:42.133
[Rosie sniffling]

23:14.533 --> 23:17.200
[pants]

23:32.867 --> 23:34.067
[mouse clicking]

23:39.500 --> 23:43.300
[David panting]

23:43.333 --> 23:45.800
[David] Just to say that,
Tara, if you're watching this,

23:45.833 --> 23:47.367
the kids and me,
we love you so much.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.433
And when we see you--

23:49.467 --> 23:51.700
well, we just want you back.

23:51.733 --> 23:55.800
And if anybody is watching this
and knows where she is...

23:56.733 --> 23:58.533
contact...

23:58.567 --> 24:02.400
We just want her back
with her family, so...

24:02.433 --> 24:04.733
-We love you very much.
-[Beech]  Thank you.

24:04.767 --> 24:07.300
Mr. Collins won't
be answering any questions
at this time.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.367
Thank you very much.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.400
[phone buzzing]

24:26.333 --> 24:27.600
Can't sleep.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.400
[Jack] Come here.

24:49.267 --> 24:52.300
If you feel bad just text me,
all right? I'll come get you.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.500
Hey.

25:07.533 --> 25:10.033
Hey.

25:10.067 --> 25:12.300
What happened to you last night?
I gave you a call.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.733
Yeah, I--
my phone was on silent,
and then it was late.

25:14.767 --> 25:16.600
-Ahh.
-So.

25:16.633 --> 25:19.533
You know that three-bedroom
in Ripley? Perfect.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.500
-Yeah, that was the one I liked.
-Yeah?

25:21.533 --> 25:24.100
I could get a transfer
to Banham. You could stay here.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.667
-It's only a ten-mile commute
for each of us.
-Yeah.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.700
Great.
So shall I arrange a viewing?

25:29.733 --> 25:31.567
-Meet you around this weekend?
-Yeah, yeah, perfect.

25:31.600 --> 25:36.133
Great. Hey, anything you want me
to go through with you?

25:36.167 --> 25:39.133
No, I'm good. Thanks though.

25:39.167 --> 25:40.200
[door opens, shuts]

25:50.067 --> 25:51.367
[car horn honks]

26:01.333 --> 26:02.367
[doorbell rings]

26:05.233 --> 26:08.800
-So, your sister-in-law offered
to take on the children?
-Yeah.

26:08.833 --> 26:12.233
-With your blessing?
-No, absolutely not, no.

26:12.267 --> 26:17.533
No, 'cause I knew,
at that point, right, that she'd
told the police lies about me.

26:17.567 --> 26:18.800
About you hitting your wife.

26:18.833 --> 26:21.167
Among other things, yeah.

26:21.200 --> 26:23.133
And so you resisted it?

26:23.167 --> 26:25.767
Yeah, I tried to. I wanted
my brother to look after them.

26:25.800 --> 26:30.033
And he agreed to move down
from Bolton after Tara died.

26:30.067 --> 26:33.200
But they put up
a very powerful argument
in court, saying that,

26:33.233 --> 26:35.800
saying that the kids
knew them better

26:35.833 --> 26:38.567
[stammers]
and that they loved them,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.200
and it was the least
disruptive option for everyone.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.367
And this was true?

26:45.333 --> 26:47.300
[sighs] Look...

26:48.333 --> 26:50.233
she'd been a good aunt,

26:50.267 --> 26:53.033
and she didn't have any kids
of her own,

26:53.067 --> 26:54.733
so I'm sure
that she did love them, yeah.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.133
Still does, in fact.

27:03.167 --> 27:07.733
Okay. And am I right
in thinking that you haven't
seen your children

27:07.767 --> 27:09.500
-since the day
you were arrested?
-No.

27:09.533 --> 27:11.433
Because?

27:11.467 --> 27:14.233
I wanted them to visit me,
of course, but they refused.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.267
Did you write to them?

27:16.300 --> 27:20.167
-Yeah, I did, at first, yeah.
-And did they write back?

27:22.600 --> 27:25.633
I got a response
to my first letter from my son.

27:25.667 --> 27:30.333
-All right.
-Which was, understandably,
very angry.

27:33.767 --> 27:38.333
[inhales] Okay, I only ask
because, in terms of the court,

27:38.367 --> 27:41.800
they will think that seven years
is a very long time for a child

27:41.833 --> 27:44.133
not to have any contact
with a parent.

27:44.167 --> 27:47.267
They've lived longer
without you than with.

27:47.300 --> 27:50.567
And you just need to be aware
that they will consider this.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.667
But they are your kids.

27:55.700 --> 27:58.400
And on balance, I still believe
that the courts would say

27:58.433 --> 28:00.667
-you have a right to see them.
-Yes.

28:00.700 --> 28:03.767
But what would
actually be better
is if we could open a dialogue

28:03.800 --> 28:06.267
with the guardians.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.633
If both sides start talking,

28:08.667 --> 28:13.033
we could resolve the issue
without getting the courts
involved at all.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.133
-Speak with Alice?
-Yeah.

28:15.167 --> 28:17.167
[scoffs]

28:17.200 --> 28:18.467
How do you feel about that?

28:22.167 --> 28:24.433
God, if I was in the same room
as that woman...

28:26.800 --> 28:28.533
[sighs]

28:28.567 --> 28:31.533
I don't think
that's gonna be a possibility.

28:31.567 --> 28:36.833
It's very clear to me
that David Collins remains
the most credible suspect.

28:36.867 --> 28:39.267
We know the blood on his coat
was his wife's.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.233
We have the sister's testimony
that there was
a history of violence

28:42.267 --> 28:44.233
from him towards Tara.

28:44.267 --> 28:47.367
We have a witness
who heard a woman scream,

28:47.400 --> 28:51.400
coming from the direction
of their house
at approximately 11 p.m.

28:51.433 --> 28:54.833
And we know that Collins lied
about his friend Tom Wilson

28:54.867 --> 28:58.200
being at their house
until 11:30 that night.

28:58.233 --> 29:00.533
Wilson actually left at 10:30,

29:00.567 --> 29:05.667
which meant Collins would
have had time to drive
to Dedham Lakes and back

29:05.700 --> 29:08.667
before being seen
by their milkman
at just after 5 a.m.

29:10.533 --> 29:14.600
But... if this murder
had happened yesterday,

29:14.633 --> 29:16.467
I would be exploring
other avenues as well.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.400
Steve...

29:20.433 --> 29:23.100
Tom Wilson.

29:23.133 --> 29:26.600
When he was first interviewed,
his account tallied
with Collins'.

29:26.633 --> 29:30.433
He said he was drinking
and playing cards with him
until 11:30.

29:30.467 --> 29:33.333
But then three days later,
he revised his timings.

29:33.367 --> 29:35.600
I want to know
why he changed his mind.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.333
Mari Luz, you and me are going
to look at Collins again.

29:38.367 --> 29:40.600
But also, Alice Moffatt.

29:40.633 --> 29:43.333
Probably not going to be
a popular line of enquiry,

29:43.367 --> 29:45.700
but the fact is
she did pretty well
out of Tara's murder.

29:45.733 --> 29:49.133
Before that she and Rob were
living in a one-bedroom flat
in Malling.

29:49.167 --> 29:54.167
Always wanted kids,
husband was infertile, so, with
Tara dead and David in prison,

29:54.200 --> 29:56.367
she had herself
a ready-made family.

29:56.400 --> 29:58.633
So, I want to go
through everything
that happened that night.

29:58.667 --> 30:01.600
I want to talk to Alice
about the meal she had
with Tara that evening

30:01.633 --> 30:05.300
and speak to the witnesses
from the restaurant.

30:05.333 --> 30:09.167
Lastly, just let's
do ourselves a favour.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.033
None of this is going
to play well out there.

30:12.067 --> 30:14.067
So, until we're obliged,

30:14.100 --> 30:17.167
let's just give
all information out
on a need-to-know basis.

30:19.133 --> 30:20.167
Great.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.367
[cell phone ringing]

30:33.233 --> 30:36.167
-[David] Hello?
-Mr. Collins,
this is DI Cathy Hudson.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.133
Your brother gave me
your number?

30:38.167 --> 30:40.200
I thought it might be useful
if we met.

30:53.767 --> 30:56.033
-[woman] Collins case?
-[Beckton] Yeah.

30:56.067 --> 30:58.167
What on earth could Tom
tell you about the Collins case?

30:58.200 --> 31:00.367
Why? Is he around?

31:00.400 --> 31:03.667
-He's doing a lecture tonight.
-Oh, okay.

31:03.700 --> 31:07.167
No problem,
I'll just give him a call.
Have you got his mobile?

31:07.200 --> 31:09.633
Give me yours,
and I'll get him to call you.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.100
How long have you two
been married now, then?

31:16.133 --> 31:18.500
Two years.

31:18.533 --> 31:22.467
What? And he never mentioned
that he used to be
David Collins' best friend?

31:22.500 --> 31:24.067
I'll get him to call you.

31:26.633 --> 31:27.733
Thanks for your time.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.300
[Alice] I'm not going to have
any discussions with him.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.133
I'm going to do everything
to prevent him

31:39.167 --> 31:40.667
from gaining any access
to the children.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.067
[Rob] Alice.
Will you just listen to me?

31:45.333 --> 31:47.367
[keyboard clacking]

32:06.100 --> 32:07.567
[Rob] What about
what the kids want?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.400
[Alice] We already know
what Rosie wants.

32:09.433 --> 32:11.400
We know what a very confused
12-year-old girl wants.

32:11.433 --> 32:13.800
-No, no, she's terrified
of him, Rob.
-Of course she is,

32:13.833 --> 32:15.400
because of everything she thinks
she knows about him.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.733
What do you mean
she thinks she knows?

32:16.767 --> 32:18.667
-What does that mean?
-Look.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.133
Whether we like it or not,
he has been released,

32:21.167 --> 32:23.200
and he will be going
after some sort of access,

32:23.233 --> 32:26.133
with a very good chance
of getting it,
so however we do it,

32:26.167 --> 32:28.067
we need to help the kids
accept that.

32:28.100 --> 32:29.800
Our children even spending
an hour with that man

32:29.833 --> 32:32.533
-makes me feel sick.
-His children.

32:32.567 --> 32:35.600
No! No.
They are not his kids.

32:35.633 --> 32:38.233
He gave up that right
when he killed their mother.
They're ours, Rob.

32:38.267 --> 32:40.667
-They are yours and mine,
they're Tara's.
-This is not helpful.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.500
-Really, really?
-You have such a fixed view
of everything!

32:43.533 --> 32:45.800
-What do you mean?
-The case, Tara, this--

32:45.833 --> 32:47.633
The last seven years wasn't
just my take on things.

32:47.667 --> 32:50.467
It was the police's,
it was ours, it was everybody's.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.300
Maybe we were wrong.

32:52.333 --> 32:55.367
Look, all I'm saying
is that after three trials,

32:55.400 --> 32:57.400
-he has been released.
-Yeah, on a technicality.

32:57.433 --> 33:00.300
-Maybe, but--
-Maybe? Maybe?

33:00.333 --> 33:04.433
I can't believe
you're even beginning to try
and defend that man.

33:04.467 --> 33:05.500
Rosie?

33:06.433 --> 33:07.600
Rosie?

33:08.567 --> 33:10.133
Rosie!

33:39.200 --> 33:42.233
[David]  My Jack,
thank you for your letter.

33:42.267 --> 33:44.667
I completely understand
your anger,

33:44.700 --> 33:47.333
and if what I have
been accused of were true,

33:47.367 --> 33:50.567
you would have every right
to hate me as much
as you say you do.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.233
Please believe
I am innocent.

33:53.267 --> 33:56.267
All I can think of is the day
that I can see you again.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.100
[waves crashing]

34:32.833 --> 34:34.033
Hello.

34:38.200 --> 34:43.733
Mm-hm. And when exactly
did Agata Wakawski
stop working for you?

34:46.533 --> 34:48.667
And any idea at all
where she is now?

34:50.700 --> 34:54.033
Any of your staff
who might know?

34:54.067 --> 34:57.133
No, I do understand.
You get a lot of churn
with immigrants,

34:57.167 --> 35:01.500
but worth asking, maybe.

35:01.533 --> 35:06.000
Okay, tell you what,
how about I drop by right now
and interview them all myself?

35:07.667 --> 35:09.133
Yes, I'll hold.

35:11.100 --> 35:14.633
So, do you still think
I killed her?

35:16.067 --> 35:18.133
Yeah.

35:18.167 --> 35:20.633
On balance, I do, yes.

35:20.667 --> 35:25.200
But there are some... gaps
in the original investigation,

35:25.233 --> 35:27.600
which I want to look in to.

35:27.633 --> 35:30.533
And I intend to find out
the truth.

35:30.567 --> 35:34.600
If you think that'll be good
for you, you'll help me.
If you don't, you won't.

35:38.500 --> 35:42.633
[clears throat] So, uh,
there are three main areas
that I want you to go away

35:42.667 --> 35:44.400
and have a think about.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.800
Firstly, and most importantly,
[clears throat]

35:46.833 --> 35:50.467
can you think of anyone
who would have maybe wanted
to hurt Tara?

35:50.500 --> 35:53.767
I want you to think
about her behaviour in the month
leading up to her death

35:53.800 --> 35:57.600
and ask yourself,
"Did anything odd happen?"

35:57.633 --> 36:00.233
Maybe something
that's occurred to you since
the original investigation,

36:00.267 --> 36:01.733
which might help us.

36:01.767 --> 36:03.433
The fractured cheek bone
that she suffered

36:03.467 --> 36:05.300
three months
before she died.

36:05.333 --> 36:08.300
Obviously, she said
she'd been mugged. Same thing.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.667
Can you go back over the days
leading up to this incident

36:10.700 --> 36:12.733
and ask yourself,

36:12.767 --> 36:17.033
"Did anything unusual occur?"
Anything at all.

36:17.067 --> 36:19.500
And then, lastly,
the blood on your coat.

36:19.533 --> 36:22.067
If it wasn't
cross-contamination,

36:22.100 --> 36:25.367
any other suggestions
for how it could have got there.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.800
Here's my card.

36:33.833 --> 36:36.733
Call me anytime,
night or day.

36:46.100 --> 36:49.667
[Tom] Well, he told the police
I was with him until 11:30,

36:49.700 --> 36:54.167
and I corroborated that
because I just assumed
he was telling the truth.

36:54.200 --> 36:56.800
And it was only later I realised
that I couldn't have been.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.533
I had an early surgery
the following day.

36:58.567 --> 37:00.433
There's no way I would
have been out that late.

37:00.467 --> 37:02.300
And my wife confirmed that.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.100
Okay. [sniffles]

37:05.133 --> 37:08.033
It was a full three days later

37:08.067 --> 37:10.433
that you decided to come forward
and correct your statement?

37:10.467 --> 37:12.333
-[exhales]
-Why was that?

37:12.367 --> 37:14.200
Because David was a friend.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.767
And because I knew
I would be trashing his alibi.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.300
At that stage,
I didn't seriously think
that he could have done it.

37:21.333 --> 37:26.367
So I held off. And I ended up
as an accessory to murder.

37:26.400 --> 37:28.567
And no one signs up
for that, do they?

37:31.200 --> 37:33.533
-[rain falling]
-[birds chirping]

37:42.467 --> 37:46.400
-There you go, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

37:46.433 --> 37:48.500
[woman]  I'll drive her back
in an hour or so.

37:48.533 --> 37:52.367
Maybe they'll have
resolved it by then.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.567
Did you ever wonder
why she never talked to us?

37:55.600 --> 37:59.733
Tara, I mean,
about David hitting her?

37:59.767 --> 38:03.533
There are things
you don't tell a parent
that you'd tell a sister.

38:04.633 --> 38:06.400
Are there?

38:06.433 --> 38:08.400
She wouldn't have wanted
to worry us.

38:10.733 --> 38:14.267
Well, you were there, Pete,
when he threatened Alice,

38:14.300 --> 38:18.100
when he threatened to kill her
just before he was charged.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.567
We both saw that, didn't we?

38:50.267 --> 38:52.800
[Cathy] I'd like to go over
what you saw that night
in the restaurant, Agata.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.800
[Agata] I said all this,
seven years ago. I went
through everything then.

38:55.833 --> 38:58.567
I just need to clarify
a couple of things.
Do you remember if they ate?

38:58.600 --> 39:03.667
No. They eat nothing.
They drink, [exhales]
all night, very drunk,

39:03.700 --> 39:06.333
particularly her,
the, uh, older one.

39:06.367 --> 39:08.800
-Alice?
-Yeah, Alice.

39:08.833 --> 39:12.700
-And what was their mood?
-Very good spirits,
laugh, laugh, laugh,

39:12.733 --> 39:14.700
till last 20 minutes,

39:14.733 --> 39:18.300
then shit, nasty row,
until they leave.

39:21.467 --> 39:25.233
I have here you said
they were in good spirits,
laughing and joking all night.

39:25.267 --> 39:28.400
Not all night,
till last 20 minutes.

39:28.433 --> 39:31.300
And the other woman working
that night... Sylvie.

39:31.333 --> 39:32.733
She didn't mention anything
about a row.

39:32.767 --> 39:34.700
Sylvie was
in different section.

39:34.733 --> 39:38.667
Plus, she didn't see what I see
when I went out for a smoke.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.400
-What did you see?
-What I told police officer.

39:43.267 --> 39:46.133
By lavatories, big sister
grab little one by throat

39:46.167 --> 39:50.300
and push into the wall.
Nasty.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.800
Why were you not called
as a witness at the trial?

39:52.733 --> 39:54.233
I don't know.

39:54.267 --> 39:55.600
I returned to Poland
for a year

39:55.633 --> 39:57.433
just after I give statement,

39:57.467 --> 40:00.100
but I would have come back
if they ask.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.500
Okay, thank you.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.367
Phil.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.267
Quick word, mate?

40:19.300 --> 40:22.267
-Eric, how's tricks?
-Yeah, all good, mate, all good.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.567
Look, I just wanted
to say that, um...

40:24.600 --> 40:27.100
you're not doing yourself
any favours,
letting him stay at yours.

40:28.467 --> 40:29.667
No one's got a problem
with you,

40:29.700 --> 40:31.500
and we understand that he's...

40:31.533 --> 40:32.767
well, you know, he's family,

40:32.800 --> 40:34.467
but, um,

40:34.500 --> 40:36.100
he'll have to find
somewhere else to live.

40:36.133 --> 40:38.700
[scoffs]

40:38.733 --> 40:41.833
He'll live
where he wants, mate.

40:41.867 --> 40:45.733
-It's a free country
last time I checked.
-He needs to leave, man.

40:52.433 --> 40:54.267
[waves crashing]

41:02.800 --> 41:05.033
-[boy giggling]
-Got you there.

41:05.067 --> 41:07.800
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing you can do!

41:07.833 --> 41:09.600
And that, young man,

41:09.633 --> 41:13.167
is how you incapacitate
your criminal bank robber.

41:13.200 --> 41:16.633
Right, go and clean your teeth.
I'll come read you a story,
all right?

41:16.667 --> 41:17.733
Chop chop.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.767
You know what?
I just remembered.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.600
We did actually try
and get hold of her, but, uh,

41:30.633 --> 41:33.633
she came
from some arse-end village
north of Gdansk,

41:33.667 --> 41:36.233
and we never managed
to track her down.

41:36.267 --> 41:38.567
I mean, obviously,
if her statement had been key,

41:38.600 --> 41:41.167
we might have tried
a little harder, but, uh...

41:41.200 --> 41:42.367
Right.

41:47.533 --> 41:51.233
It's just 'cause...
she now says that she told you

41:51.267 --> 41:54.667
-that she saw Alice assault
her sister that night.
-Assault her?

41:54.700 --> 41:56.833
-Yeah.
-Assault her how?

41:56.867 --> 41:59.800
She said she grabbed her
by the throat and pushed her
against a wall.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.100
[chuckles] Jesus.

42:02.133 --> 42:05.300
No, she never said anything
remotely like that.

42:07.767 --> 42:09.733
Obviously, she didn't,
'cause if she had have done,

42:09.767 --> 42:11.500
it would be
in her witness statement,
wouldn't it?

42:11.533 --> 42:13.000
Yeah, of course,
yeah, it would.

42:18.867 --> 42:21.333
I'm just wondering
why she'd say that to me, then?

42:21.367 --> 42:24.133
I don't know.
Maybe she remembered it wrong.

42:24.167 --> 42:27.667
Or... maybe she's got
some agenda we don't know about?

42:27.700 --> 42:30.367
-You tell me.
-I don't know. I've no idea.

42:38.833 --> 42:40.033
[Beech] Jacob!

42:42.500 --> 42:45.467
Jack, Rosie, supper.

42:55.867 --> 43:00.000
-Where's Jack?
-I thought he was down here.
He's not upstairs.

43:01.333 --> 43:02.633
Is he with Dad?

43:07.100 --> 43:09.600
Rob, have you seen Jack?

43:09.633 --> 43:11.367
-Isn't he back?
-No.

43:13.433 --> 43:14.733
Call his mobile.

43:18.833 --> 43:20.300
Jack?

43:22.067 --> 43:23.300
Jack?

43:24.567 --> 43:25.700
Jack?

43:26.733 --> 43:29.833
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

43:29.867 --> 43:31.733
[Rob] Give us a bell as soon
as you hear this message.

43:31.767 --> 43:33.167
Cheers, mate.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.100
Voicemail.

43:35.133 --> 43:36.567
I just presumed
he'd be in his room.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.267
He hasn't been home
since school.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.133
That's fine.
He'll be at some club

43:40.167 --> 43:43.200
-and just forgotten to tell us.
-It's 7:30, Rob.

43:43.233 --> 43:45.200
Rosie, darling,
do you want to lay the table?

43:48.833 --> 43:52.567
-What if he's taken him, Rob?
-He wouldn't take him.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.500
He knows this house.
He knows where we live.

43:57.167 --> 43:58.567
I'll call the police.

44:06.467 --> 44:08.100
-[thuds]
-[clicks]

44:17.267 --> 44:18.667
[grunts]

44:26.133 --> 44:27.367
Fuck!

44:30.533 --> 44:32.200
Hello, mate.

44:32.233 --> 44:34.067
What the fuck are you doing
in my house?

44:35.600 --> 44:36.567
What do you want?

44:36.600 --> 44:38.600
[woman] Tom?

44:38.633 --> 44:41.267
It's all right, love,
I'm just on the phone.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.100
How did you get in here?

44:44.767 --> 44:46.833
Back door was open.

44:46.867 --> 44:50.633
-I was worried about you, mate.
-I'm calling the police.

44:50.667 --> 44:52.700
No, no, Tom.

44:52.733 --> 44:54.567
No need, I'll go.

44:55.833 --> 44:57.233
I'll go.

45:09.333 --> 45:11.033
I just wanted
to see you, mate.

45:12.633 --> 45:14.300
And I wanted to ask you...

45:16.700 --> 45:19.700
were you just fucking my wife,
or did you kill her too?

45:36.200 --> 45:38.300
[door closes]

45:38.333 --> 45:40.333
Tom?

45:40.367 --> 45:42.400
It's all right,
it's all right, it's fine.

45:45.367 --> 45:45.433
It's fine.
