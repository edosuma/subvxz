WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:14.681
[Sam] I like George Lazenby.
At least he's the right age.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.225
What are you saying?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.853
Roger Moore is by far the best Bond.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.856
Nobody thinks that.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.065
Well, I do.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.609
You haven't even seen <i>A View to a Kill.</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:29.612
Yeah, well, I saw <i>Moonraker</i> and there
was a pigeon that did a double take.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.572
[laughing]

00:32.615 --> 00:33.950
That was really brilliant.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.455
Hey, hey.
Can you hang back a few minutes?

00:39.039 --> 00:42.000
Doesn't look good, us going in together.
Need to keep it professional.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.918
It's not professional. We're shagging.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.838
I know, but we still need
to look professional.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.674
-Why do I have to hang back?
-Because I'm the director.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.717
I can't be late.

00:53.720 --> 00:54.554
Hey, girl.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.765
-Hey.
-What you doing?

00:56.848 --> 00:57.932
I'm just waiting.

00:58.475 --> 01:01.061
Sam doesn't want us
to walk in together, so... [chuckles]

01:03.438 --> 01:04.731
Not touching that one.

01:08.985 --> 01:09.861
[sighs]

01:14.949 --> 01:16.868
-[grunts]
-[indistinct chatter]

01:27.337 --> 01:28.171
Are you okay?

01:30.340 --> 01:32.175
-Is everything all right with--
-It's fine.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.553
I'm just-- I'm pissed
we didn't get to do the move.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.015
I can stay after
if you want to work on it more.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.016
I can't.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.729
The move's easy. We'll be fine.
Just won't get distracted next time.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.697
All right, well, this is exciting.
The match on Friday was a success.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.118
If we keep that up, we're gonna
have a bona fide hit on our hands.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.285
[women cheering]

01:59.369 --> 02:02.956
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
There's still stuff to do before we shoot.

02:03.039 --> 02:06.209
-Are we shooting it here?
-In this gray, depressing shithole? No.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.086
I'm going with Bash to look at a venue.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.131
It's expensive, but I'm not
the one signing the checks, so...

02:11.214 --> 02:12.590
What's our lighting grid like?

02:13.842 --> 02:17.387
All right, so today, we're gonna focus
on selling the drama. All right?

02:17.887 --> 02:19.973
Fortune Cookie,
can you give me more anger?

02:20.640 --> 02:24.018
All right, a little less swordplay.
I don't want it to be about the prop.

02:24.102 --> 02:26.271
-You know? The kung-fu stuff is great.
-Mm-hmm.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.399
All right. Sheila,
you ever thought about claws, maybe?

02:29.482 --> 02:30.483
Could be interesting.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.361
-That sounds dangerous.
-Yes! It's gonna be dangerous.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.948
Cherry, Welfare Queen,
memorable performances.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.241
Amazing. I was hooked.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.661
That said, there's no world
in which KKK members

02:41.744 --> 02:44.622
are gonna be wrestling on television,
not even cable television,

02:44.706 --> 02:48.001
so, get with the old ladies,
figure something else out.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.921
Rhonda. You're late.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.557
[talking indistinctly]

03:05.894 --> 03:08.479
-[Stacey] Hey, do you have a tampon?
-Uh, no. Sorry.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.398
[Arthie] I've got.

03:12.358 --> 03:16.404
-Oh. I said "tampon," not a diaper.
-Actually, I do need a neck brace.

03:16.487 --> 03:19.490
-My neck is killing me.
-I'm trying to protect you.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.117
From Toxic Shock Syndrome.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.703
Listen, you can't--
You can't move in this thing. Look.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.331
-Try.
-I'm stuck. I'm stuck.

03:26.414 --> 03:29.000
-I can't--
-Oh, yeah?

03:29.083 --> 03:31.252
Worked today. I had you in a head scissor.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.129
Ugh. Don't make me ralph!

03:33.212 --> 03:34.297
Stace. Here.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.090
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.343
-[Rhonda] Can I have one too?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.470
[Melrose] Arthie, no one wants that.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.805
-Me three.
-[Melrose] Okey-dokey, here we go.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.141
It's not yet, but I can feel it's coming.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.687
You guys, we are on the same cycle.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.357
<i>♪ Finally a team, we're finally a team ♪</i>

03:52.440 --> 03:54.108
Sisters of the moon, rejoice.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.903
[Melrose]
You better cheer it up right now.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.655
[women laughing]

03:58.738 --> 04:00.323
[Melrose] It's raining tampons.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.076
-What's in your pants?
-[Stacey] I got you.

04:03.159 --> 04:03.993
[indistinct chatter]

04:05.536 --> 04:06.996
[Melrose] Tampons, tampons.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.414
Someone sent you a card.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.334
They're birthday scratchers from my aunt.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.961
[toilet flushing]

04:13.044 --> 04:13.920
[Jenny] Hold up.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.131
What did you say?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.467
-It's-- Don't make a big--
-You guys. Oh, my God.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.219
You guys, it's Sheila's birthday.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.554
[women] Happy birthday, Sheila!

04:23.638 --> 04:25.598
Why didn't you say something?
I love birthdays.

04:25.682 --> 04:26.766
It's fine. Really.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.892
Don't make a fuss.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.019
Oh, we're going to make a fuss, majorly.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.897
Let me handle it. This is my passion.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.440
Please kill me.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.358
Oh.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.068
Not on your birthday.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.862
Oh, Sheila. Oh, my God.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.241
We have a party to plan.
Okay, there's so much to do.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.826
Stacey, Stacey, I could use you.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.332
[line ringing]

04:52.166 --> 04:53.793
-[Florian] <i>Howard residence.</i>
-Hey.

04:53.876 --> 04:56.045
It's Sam. Is your master home?

04:56.129 --> 04:56.963
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

04:57.547 --> 04:59.299
-I haven't seen Bash for three days.
<i>-What?</i>

04:59.382 --> 05:01.509
Isn't it your job
to keep tabs on that guy?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.219
<i>I answer when he rings the bell,</i>

05:03.303 --> 05:05.596
but no one's rung the bell
for three days, dude.

05:06.180 --> 05:09.225
Last night was breakfast-for-dinner night,
and I was the only one who ate it.

05:09.309 --> 05:14.063
All right. Well, if he rings the bell,
tell Bash that I need to talk to him.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.023
<i>Okay.</i>

05:20.361 --> 05:21.195
[clears throat]

05:22.196 --> 05:23.281
Yes?

05:24.532 --> 05:27.994
I just wanted to assure you that
what happened the other night was a fluke.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.872
Debbie and I have been
doing great together,

05:30.955 --> 05:34.834
and I for one am certain we will triumph.

05:34.917 --> 05:35.835
Yeah, yeah.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.587
I've met you.

05:39.797 --> 05:40.798
[sighs]

05:41.215 --> 05:43.259
Hey, wait. Can I talk to you for a second?

05:43.968 --> 05:46.054
-Yeah.
-Uh... Me and Rhonda...

05:47.263 --> 05:48.973
It's fucking conspicuous, right?

05:49.515 --> 05:51.684
-I'm not sure what you mean.
-[stammers]

05:51.768 --> 05:53.978
Usually when I sleep with an actress,
they keep quiet,

05:54.479 --> 05:56.689
for their own sake.
But she doesn't seem to care.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.483
She's just... reckless.

05:58.566 --> 06:01.402
It's hard, with 14 women.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.112
-Everyone talks.
-Fuck.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.115
I have to break up with her.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.243
I feel like I'm losing my authority.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.830
-Hmm.
-You wanna go see a venue?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.666
Bash is MIA. I could use a second opinion.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.920
You know what?
I would be honored to be a part

06:19.003 --> 06:22.173
-of the decision-making process.
-Oh, you're not gonna have a say.

06:22.256 --> 06:25.760
I just need someone to disagree with
so I can clarify my own instincts.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.512
Oh, get it. Get it.

06:28.387 --> 06:29.847
Yeah. You can have some.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.641
There you go.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.643
[Randy babbling]

06:38.606 --> 06:39.440
Here you go.

06:39.524 --> 06:43.069
Signed, sealed, notarized. Fuck you!
Have a nice life.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.278
[whispers] Hi, I love you.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.409
-What are you doing?
-I don't accept this.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.661
How can you not?
You're the one who served me.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.204
I was freaking out.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.790
I couldn't find you,
I couldn't even talk to you.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.544
I had to get some power back
in this situation.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.671
-The balance was off.
-Well, it's too late.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.298
I already made another copy
and sent it to my lawyer.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.801
No lawyer is gonna let you sign a document
that guarantees me

07:06.884 --> 07:09.303
-ten percent of all your future income.
-What?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.389
It was a dramatic gesture.

07:11.472 --> 07:12.557
Oh, how actress-y of you.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.851
I claimed you were having an affair
with Burt Reynolds.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.396
I never actually intended
to hand the papers to you.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.566
I just got mad
and handed the papers to you.

07:21.649 --> 07:24.527
I am glad we never kept a gun
in the house.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.196
You are such an immature fuck.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.490
Will you do something about his face?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.201
-Give me a paper towel.
-All right.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.456
Okay. Mark, he has no fucking teeth.
We can't give him celery.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.582
[Randy fusses]

07:37.665 --> 07:39.083
[Mark] You're right, okay?

07:39.542 --> 07:41.961
I am all of the things
that you wanna scream at me.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.673
You are entitled to your anger,
and I acknowledge it.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.926
Who are you right now?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.305
Going to therapy.
Been going twice a week.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.891
-You're going to therapy?
-Yeah.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.311
Seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist.
Her name is Linda.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.771
Okay. I don't know what that means.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.900
It means that I'm trying to work
on my issues

08:03.983 --> 08:06.527
and make some progress so
you'll consider working on our marriage.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.492
Stay for dinner. We can start there.

08:12.575 --> 08:15.077
-I am not ready to come home.
-I didn't say come home,

08:15.703 --> 08:16.746
I just said dinner.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.999
And I can put Randy down. I'll cook.

08:22.627 --> 08:23.461
Please.

08:25.713 --> 08:26.923
Since when do you cook?

08:28.633 --> 08:29.842
Since my wife left me.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.099
We had a booking cancel
at the last minute.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.852
Styx, but you didn't hear it from me.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.398
[Ruth] Whoa.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.610
[Sam] Good, right?
Used to be a porno theater.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.239
Well, it must've been the golden age
of whacking off.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.742
Was it Aztec porn?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.494
Actually, Mayan.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.539
This was part of the Mayan Revival
movement of the '20s.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.416
Did the movement involve blood sacrifice?

09:02.917 --> 09:05.294
-Your girlfriend is quite the comedian.
-We're not--

09:05.378 --> 09:07.755
-She's not my girlfriend.
-If you want the space,

09:07.838 --> 09:11.175
it's 9,000, and I would need 4,500
to hold the booking.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.052
Take your time.

09:13.928 --> 09:14.762
[Sam sighs]

09:16.264 --> 09:20.142
[Ruth] I mean, the place looked great
in <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:24.355
"Snakes. I hate snakes."

09:25.314 --> 09:26.774
What's the matter with you?

09:27.316 --> 09:29.610
You're here as a benign sounding board.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.404
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.949
I guess it's just... not what I pictured.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.993
Well, you're not the director.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.288
Fine. Tell me what you're picturing.

09:41.998 --> 09:42.915
[sighs]

09:42.999 --> 09:43.874
Okay.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.463
All right. So, we're gonna put the ring...

09:51.465 --> 09:52.550
right here.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.345
We're gonna get rid of the stage.
We'll bring in folding chairs, right?

09:56.429 --> 10:00.099
I'm gonna change out those shitty ropes
we've been using, make 'em pink.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.892
Now, there's gonna be people up there,

10:01.976 --> 10:04.353
so we're gonna put a stationary camera
up there,

10:04.437 --> 10:07.607
maybe a camera on a jib,
moving around. Right?

10:07.690 --> 10:10.735
I mean, this could either feel dinky
or it could feel epic,

10:10.818 --> 10:12.737
so, let's go big, let's make it visceral,

10:12.820 --> 10:15.031
let's make it like a...
A fucking rock concert.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.492
But I'll leave enough room
around the sides of the stage

10:18.576 --> 10:20.244
so, I can get in with the handheld,

10:20.328 --> 10:24.498
so, we can feel the struggle,
the drama, the victory, the defeat.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.708
The glitter.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.711
-Are you making fun of me?
-No.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.796
Well, what do you think? Honestly.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.676
I think... honestly...

10:38.262 --> 10:39.263
it's perfect.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.264
Told you.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.398
[sighs]

10:51.275 --> 10:53.444
Are you waiting for me
to open the door for you?

10:53.527 --> 10:57.156
No. I just... don't really wanna face
the rest of my day.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.535
Oh, God.
See, we all have shit to face.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.622
Guess there's no point in putting it off.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.333
Now's as good a time as any, right?

11:08.334 --> 11:09.377

23:03.590 --> 23:06.551
Make space in the relationship
for you to fuck someone else?

23:09.012 --> 23:09.846
[sighs]

23:12.808 --> 23:13.642
[clears throat]

23:14.059 --> 23:16.895
You stopped talking to me.
You stopped sleeping with me,

23:17.521 --> 23:20.023
which is not an excuse
for anything that happened,

23:20.607 --> 23:23.360
but I remember thinking to myself:

23:25.612 --> 23:30.075
"How many days can she go
without... touching me

23:30.158 --> 23:32.494
or asking how my day was?"

23:34.746 --> 23:35.580
Forty-two days.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.798
-Well, Mark, I'd just had a baby.
-This was, uh... before Randy.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.557
Why did we start a family
if we were so miserable?

23:53.640 --> 23:57.102
We thought we could make things better.
And I think we still can.

24:01.481 --> 24:03.150
-Can you let me hug you?
-[sobs, sniffles]

24:03.233 --> 24:04.568
No, I'm not hugging you.

24:04.651 --> 24:08.321
It's more of, like, a therapeutic lean.
My therapist taught it to me.

24:08.405 --> 24:12.492
-Why were you hugging your therapist?
-Because it helps. Please?

24:14.202 --> 24:16.454
You have to put your weight on me.
It's about intimacy.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.831
Oh, my God.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.510
We're supposed to do this
for 30 seconds at a time.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.512
-Three times a day.
-Don't push your luck.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.405
[dial tone humming]

24:53.575 --> 24:55.577
[line ringing]

24:59.289 --> 25:00.332
Hey, it's Ruth.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.044
Yeah. Sorry to bother you.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.588
I didn't know who else to call.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.439
I broke up with Rhonda.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.527
Seemed to be the right thing to do.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.738
I tried to be nice about it,
but, you know,

26:13.822 --> 26:15.532
she got a little emotional and...

26:16.908 --> 26:19.077
-What are you gonna do, right?
-Hmm.

26:41.558 --> 26:42.642
Um...

26:42.726 --> 26:44.686
Ruth Wilder.
I have a ten a.m. appointment.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.730
Hi, Ruth.
If you could just sign in for me.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.481
-Sure.
-And...

26:49.524 --> 26:52.027
-if you could sign these for me as well.
-Mm-hmm.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.072
The doctor will answer any questions
that you and your boyfriend might have.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.199
-Oh, we're not--
-Oh, I'm not her boyfriend.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.534
I'm her husband.

27:00.535 --> 27:04.289
Common mistake. You know,
sort of like having sex without a condom.

27:05.248 --> 27:07.792
-Right?
-It's good that you're here.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.338
Just wasn't the right time for us,
you know?

27:11.421 --> 27:14.257
I could've pulled out, but just got lazy.

27:15.300 --> 27:18.303
Lucky for us, we hate children.
Right, honey?

27:19.929 --> 27:20.847
Please have a seat.

27:23.016 --> 27:23.850
Thanks.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.617
Sorry. I'm sure this is not how
you wanted to spend your morning.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.285
It's fine.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.289
I'll go get doughnuts
while you're in there.

27:46.373 --> 27:47.749
Pick me up a pink frosted?

27:47.832 --> 27:51.169
[chuckles] Pink frosted.
What, are you six?

27:51.252 --> 27:52.879
I like pink things.

27:52.962 --> 27:53.797
Mm.

27:55.006 --> 27:59.302
If you'd liked pink things a little less,
maybe we wouldn't be here right now.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.387
[scoffs]

28:04.307 --> 28:08.478
I feel like I'm supposed to ask you
if this is what you want.

28:09.312 --> 28:11.106
I mean, you know, as your husband.

28:14.901 --> 28:15.735
Yeah.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.822
It's not the right time.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.366
Not the right baby.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.120
-[woman] Ruth Wilder?
-Fuck.

28:26.121 --> 28:26.996
That was quick.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.874
Don't come back without doughnuts.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.797
I think I'll wait.
You can pick them out yourself.

28:43.096 --> 28:44.848
[in Russian accent] In Soviet Union,

28:44.931 --> 28:47.350
abortion is only thing
there is no line for.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.941
-Right this way.
-Mm-hmm.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.284
And you have considered all your options?

29:07.287 --> 29:08.163
Yes.

29:09.038 --> 29:12.125
And you're comfortable with the decision
to end your pregnancy?

29:12.208 --> 29:13.251
Yes.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.962
Okay. Then we'll get started.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.632
Now, I'm going to give an injection
next to your cervix

29:19.716 --> 29:22.844
that will numb your uterus
and then we'll start the procedure.

29:23.553 --> 29:26.514
Now, you're going to feel
a little pressure, okay?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.849
Does this all make sense?

29:29.559 --> 29:30.518
I'm a wrestler.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.103
What's that?

29:34.022 --> 29:35.732
Yes. I understand.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.860
Take a deep breath and try to relax.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.991
[inhales sharply]

29:55.210 --> 29:56.211
[exhales]
