WEBVTT

00:19.417 --> 00:21.959
- First round's on me,
ladies.
- Alright.

00:22.041 --> 00:23.125
I'm alright, Roy.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.709
Think I'll get
some real food.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.417
Nah, you're
coming
down to Shiny's.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.417
Come on, Mike.
You don't like vodka
breakfast?

00:28.500 --> 00:30.750
[chuckles]
Got to work
on my boat, fellas.

00:30.834 --> 00:32.333
Thing's a frigging
masterpiece by now.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.166
Well, I'm taking it
to Florida this year.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.291
Yeah. I'll bet you a round
he doesn't do it.

00:36.375 --> 00:37.917
Double or
nothing,
next five years

00:38.000 --> 00:39.375
he still
doesn't do
it.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.750
- Funny.
- Yeah.

00:40.834 --> 00:44.208
Yeah. Um, you guys just, um..

00:46.041 --> 00:47.834
I'll see you.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.959
Hello?

01:20.625 --> 01:22.208
Hello!

01:44.625 --> 01:47.542
Are you okay?
What's, um..

01:49.041 --> 01:51.458
Hey, what's wrong with her?

01:58.166 --> 02:01.333
Oh, God.
She's burning up.

02:01.417 --> 02:03.125
Hey. Hey.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.583
I am taking you out of here.

02:07.667 --> 02:10.375
- No.
- Yes.

02:10.458 --> 02:11.542
You're sick.

02:11.625 --> 02:14.125
I'm taking you.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.792
Here we go.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.250
Feds have been building
a case for years against

03:09.333 --> 03:11.291
an Eastern European criminal.

03:11.375 --> 03:14.083
Big-time guy,
goes by Nachalneek.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.250
- Nachalneek?
- Russian for boss.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.709
He's the puppet master
of a brutal organization.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.000
They have him?

03:20.083 --> 03:21.834
He's a phantom.
Never been ID'd.

03:21.917 --> 03:23.083
What do his puppets do?

03:23.166 --> 03:25.625
Human traffic at the docks.

03:25.709 --> 03:27.083
Port of Philadelphia's been ID'd

03:27.166 --> 03:30.041
as a hub for importing
young girls.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.625
Forced prostitution.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.000
Perfect access
for New York, Jersey, DC.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.417
Had a female floater
in the Delaware yesterday.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.875
'Jane Doe so far.'

03:37.959 --> 03:39.458
(Lilly)
'Think she was trafficked?'

03:39.542 --> 03:41.125
(Alexandra)
'Dental work's
Eastern European.'

03:41.208 --> 03:42.583
Poor quality, metal fillings.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.333
How does she connect
to Nachalneek?

03:44.417 --> 03:46.083
Right age, ethnicity.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.834
Other signs of his MO.

03:47.917 --> 03:48.959
Like?

03:49.041 --> 03:50.750
Cigarette burns.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.959
Soles of her feet.

03:53.041 --> 03:55.959
South detectives are working
the Jane Doe floater.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.625
Where do we come in?

03:57.709 --> 04:00.417
Got any cold jobs like her?

04:00.500 --> 04:03.500
Solve that, might help the
feds'
case against Nachalneek.

04:04.709 --> 04:07.250
I don't recall
any Jane Does like this.

04:07.333 --> 04:11.041
Yeah, but we had a
guy
a Polish name.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.667
Cigarette burns
on his feet, '05 job.

04:15.750 --> 04:16.875
You know him, boss?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.959
(John)
'The case caught my eye.'

04:19.041 --> 04:21.291
'He was a longshoreman
at the port.'

04:21.375 --> 04:25.125
Working the docks, he could've
crossed paths with Nachalneek.

04:25.208 --> 04:27.667
Might be the key
to solving this guy's murder.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.792
(Scotty)
'And catching a ghost.'

05:04.458 --> 05:06.208
(Will)
'Mike Chulaski, 35.'

05:06.291 --> 05:08.375
Longshoreman at
Harrison Marine Terminal.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.709
No family.

05:09.792 --> 05:12.083
Six days before
anyone reported him missing.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.709
Guy was invisible,
barely left a
footprint.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.458
Workers on the docks
said he never missed a day.

05:17.542 --> 05:21.083
And this was his
pride and joy.

05:21.166 --> 05:23.417
- Oh! Nice boat.
- 'Hmm.'

05:23.500 --> 05:25.542
Wouldn't mind one
like it myself.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.792
Mike lived on it.

05:26.875 --> 05:29.041
Went missing
after he was killed.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.625
I'll start looking for it.

05:30.709 --> 05:34.000
Motel he was found in
was on the other side of town.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.875
They were working a theory
Mike was killed by a pimp.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.625
'Bludgeoned with a lamp.'

05:38.709 --> 05:40.083
Lots of prints, no matches.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.000
Motel clerk said another guy
rented the room.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.291
'Can't describe him.'

05:44.375 --> 05:46.875
No-tell motel for you.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.792
Copies of the bills
of lading for the boxes

05:48.875 --> 05:50.083
that came
into the terminal.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.417
- Boxes?
- Containers.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.834
The FBI says the ones
with the human cargo arrived

05:54.917 --> 05:56.625
when Mike's dock gang
was working.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.583
So maybe Mike was in on it?

05:58.667 --> 05:59.750
Oh, we can't tell.

05:59.834 --> 06:01.083
But in shipping,
nothing happens

06:01.166 --> 06:02.834
without the
foreman
knowing about it.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.834
Says here that
was Roy Gardecki.

06:05.917 --> 06:08.417
Mike's boss.
I'll go talk to him.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.750
Know a lot about the port.

06:09.834 --> 06:13.041
I worked on the docks
when I was 16.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.792
Boxes from your
terminal
were used

06:24.875 --> 06:26.417
to transport young girls, Roy.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.667
Fellas, I already
talked to the FBI.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.875
Not about
Mike Chulaski's murder.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.458
Could be just what they need
to push their case through.

06:34.542 --> 06:36.625
And you get 20 years inside.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.959
The feds don't know
what it's like down here.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.458
Of course, they don't.

06:40.542 --> 06:42.959
They don't know about
the lowlifes coming around

06:43.041 --> 06:46.500
preying on the working man
trying to earn a decent wage.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.041
And you do?

06:48.125 --> 06:50.041
Worked here when I was a kid.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.625
'Things I saw.'

06:51.709 --> 06:53.834
Then you know
it's backbreaking.

06:53.917 --> 06:55.083
Hard work.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.250
Lot of temptation
for the easy money.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.625
(Nick)
'Regular guy like
Mike Chulaski gets tempted.'

06:59.709 --> 07:01.417
Ends up dead, right, Roy?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.583
So you and Mike
line your
pockets

07:03.667 --> 07:07.208
look the other way
when those containers came
in.

07:08.917 --> 07:11.166
Money was good.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.917
- Mike never knew about it.
- Why not cut him in?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.834
Wasn't that kind of guy.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.667
He had no idea.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.333
Till that morning.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.750
No, it's okay.
What are we gonna do, Roy?

07:33.834 --> 07:35.500
She's so young.

07:35.583 --> 07:38.333
- Where are her parents?
- Alright, easy there.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.166
(Lena)
'Fifteen.'

07:40.250 --> 07:41.667
Not so young.

07:42.959 --> 07:44.417
We could call the cops.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.375
Mike, think about what you
could be getting into here.

07:49.291 --> 07:53.250
P-p-phone Ki-Kiril for job.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.417
- For me.
- No, no, no.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.166
You don't want a
job
with that guy.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.250
Mike. Mike!

08:00.333 --> 08:02.041
Come here.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.709
Look.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.375
'You can put her back.'

08:09.458 --> 08:12.375
Right now. Kiril will
kill you if you don't.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.792
Let me go.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.333
Hey, hey, hey.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.875
You got anybody

08:21.000 --> 08:23.583
in America that we can
call right now?

08:23.667 --> 08:24.917
Family?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.250
No.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.917
No family, anywhere?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.417
From orphanage.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.917
Ukraine.

08:32.208 --> 08:33.625
I don't have family either.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.041
Orphan.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.834
- Me--
- Mike!

08:38.917 --> 08:40.917
What if that was you
lying on that couch, huh?

08:41.000 --> 08:42.083
Sick kid?

08:42.166 --> 08:43.250
These people are
running
a business!

08:43.333 --> 08:46.291
She doesn't have
anyone in the world!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.125
You know what that feels like?

08:51.208 --> 08:52.959
'No one to look out for you.'

08:53.041 --> 08:56.000
- I do.
- You're gonna keep her?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.458
It's crazy.

08:57.542 --> 09:00.000
I'm not putting her
in that van, Roy.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.417
And if you tell me
to do it one more time

09:02.500 --> 09:05.417
well, maybe you and me..

09:07.500 --> 09:10.583
...we go to the cops together.

09:11.917 --> 09:15.291
Who was this Kiril
she wanted to reach?

09:15.375 --> 09:18.500
American.
Transported the girls.

09:18.583 --> 09:19.917
Middleman.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.208
- Got a number for him?
- Look, I told you what I
know.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.500
Meet you back
at the car, Nick.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.375
I know the waterfront, Roy.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.792
Mike stood up
against the lowlifes.

09:35.875 --> 09:38.333
It got him crushed.

09:38.417 --> 09:40.166
'You looked the other way.'

09:41.667 --> 09:44.375
Now's your chance
to make it right.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.583
I'm not asking.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.250
Give me a number for Kiril.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.000
Never had one.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.417
Runner dropped a message,
which box to set aside

09:57.500 --> 09:59.417
he'd show up to unload.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.959
That's it.

10:02.041 --> 10:03.834
Any idea who he was working for?

10:03.917 --> 10:06.041
Called him Nachalneek.

10:06.125 --> 10:08.542
Kiril was terrified of the guy.

10:08.625 --> 10:12.792
- What'd Mike do with Lena?
- Took her to his boat.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.333
Said he was gonna help her.

10:14.417 --> 10:15.500
He say how?

10:15.583 --> 10:17.458
Try and get her a visa,
take her to some

10:17.542 --> 10:19.041
community center for advice

10:19.125 --> 10:22.458
where people would know
about that stuff.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.041
We don't deal with illegals.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.250
- Must get a few in here.
- Uh-huh.

10:32.333 --> 10:35.500
I mainly deal with exchange
students who want to stay.

10:35.583 --> 10:38.041
Occasionally,
these girls show up.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.250
- Girls like Lena?
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.041
They lie about
how they got here

10:42.125 --> 10:44.417
but we all know.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.792
Out of the containers.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.583
Any of the girls
mention
the name Nachalneek?

10:50.667 --> 10:51.709
No.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.875
They never give any details.

10:54.959 --> 10:56.166
I do what I can for them

10:56.250 --> 10:59.792
but they're not supposed
to be here.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.208
You try helping Lena?

11:01.291 --> 11:04.125
Can't help someone
who doesn't want it.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.583
(Lena)
'I have no money, Mike.'

11:08.667 --> 11:10.125
This lady
helps
you for free.

11:11.917 --> 11:16.083
In America people do stuff
'cause they're kind, you
know?

11:16.166 --> 11:19.500
'Not 'cause they want
something from you.'

11:19.583 --> 11:21.375
You okay?

11:21.458 --> 11:25.000
She doesn't qualify
for the T1 visa.

11:25.083 --> 11:26.125
Why not?

11:26.208 --> 11:27.750
She wasn't prostituted,
was she?

11:27.834 --> 11:29.041
No, course not.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.625
Then technically,
she's here illegally.

11:30.709 --> 11:31.875
That's how the embassy
will see it

11:31.959 --> 11:33.333
and they will
deport her.

11:33.417 --> 11:34.625
'That doesn't make sense.'

11:34.709 --> 11:36.792
Back to Ukraine?

11:36.875 --> 11:39.500
- No!
- Lena, don't go.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.875
You don't understand
what could happen to
you.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.709
I can't go back.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.375
No money. No family.
Nothing there.

11:46.458 --> 11:48.792
You got someone
who cares about you now.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.875
You don't have to go
it
alone anymore.

11:55.417 --> 11:57.125
I'm hungry.

11:57.208 --> 11:58.542
Can I have candy bar?

12:00.375 --> 12:02.166
Why don't you eat a real meal?

12:02.250 --> 12:04.291
'Get your strength up.'

12:04.375 --> 12:06.750
Better than nothing, I guess.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.125
I got some change.

12:09.208 --> 12:10.792
Machine's that way.

12:17.375 --> 12:19.041
'Growing up on your own..'

12:19.917 --> 12:21.542
'...it's hard.'

12:21.625 --> 12:23.667
People treat you
like a punching bag.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.583
I don't want that
to happen to her.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.208
Knocks the life out of you.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.458
There's not much you can do
for her, I'm afraid.

12:29.542 --> 12:33.917
I can look out for
her,
you know?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.917
'Like family.'

12:36.000 --> 12:38.166
Young girl.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.875
Can be difficult.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.083
Lena?

12:47.166 --> 12:48.625
Lena!

12:48.709 --> 12:49.875
Lena?

12:49.959 --> 12:51.083
Lena!

12:51.166 --> 12:53.792
She makes a phone call
and she's gone.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.583
I wish I could've helped more

12:55.667 --> 12:58.041
but there's a new one
every day.

12:59.417 --> 13:00.667
Think of anything else

13:00.750 --> 13:02.542
you can reach us here.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.959
There's only one person
Lena wanted to call.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.333
Kiril.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.542
So she goes to meet him?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.208
And Mike knows it,
tracks them down.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.291
[phone ringing]
Gets himself killed,
playing hero.

13:17.375 --> 13:19.208
What do you got?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.834
I need some lost hours.

13:25.041 --> 13:28.250
(male #1)
'I didn't know who else to
call
since the husband took off.'

13:28.333 --> 13:30.291
I last saw
her
a week ago.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.500
She won't answer
the door.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.542
Okay.

13:34.625 --> 13:37.542
She's always saying how her
daughter's got a good job.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.583
Smart girl.

13:39.667 --> 13:41.041
Is she?

13:41.125 --> 13:43.208
So, I thought maybe you could
take care of the rent.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.792
- 'She's due three weeks ago.'
- Yeah, sure.

13:45.875 --> 13:48.000
You said it's been a week?

13:48.083 --> 13:49.667
Yeah.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.333
- Mom?
- She alright?

14:01.417 --> 14:03.500
Mom? No.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.291
Call 911.

14:41.417 --> 14:45.125
You said you'd clean up
this time.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.917
Nice job.
Ending up in the ER.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.667
I gotta go home.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.959
And you're not going anywhere.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.041
I'm going home, Lilly. Oh.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.875
Doctor said
you can't drink again.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.834
Help me out
here,
will ya?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.625
Where's my coat?

15:09.583 --> 15:11.792
You have late-stage
cirrhosis.

15:12.709 --> 15:14.458
You're getting admitted.

15:14.542 --> 15:18.083
You can't...have
another drink again.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.667
'Not one.'

15:21.709 --> 15:24.792
- I'm fine, Lilly.
- 'Yeah.'

15:24.875 --> 15:26.792
You look great, mom.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.917
What do you want from me?

15:39.333 --> 15:42.125
You'll have to come
stay with me.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.667
I thought you were
getting too old for this.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.250
I said that
when I still had a choice.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.458
Kiril's in custody.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.375
Tracked him
to a pay-as-you-go cell.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.458
Kiril faces federal
trafficking charges.

16:08.542 --> 16:10.875
Any deal's possible
if he points to
Nachalneek.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.542
Even if he killed
Mike Chulaski?

16:12.625 --> 16:14.375
Any deal. US Attorney's
gunning for Nachalneek.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.667
It's all about
the big fish, huh?

16:15.750 --> 16:18.166
Never mind a poor working guy
getting offed.

16:18.250 --> 16:20.583
Nachalneek's the prize.

16:27.208 --> 16:30.083
Prize is locking up
Mike's doer for life.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.291
Not for the feds.

16:31.375 --> 16:32.667
Yeah, we'll help them
get their phantom.

16:32.750 --> 16:33.875
Good.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.417
Ain't gonna cut a deal
with a murderer,
though.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.083
Don't go cowboy
on this, okay?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.417
What the hell
does that mean?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.166
The Burrell job, Scotty.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.125
Vigilante dad?

16:45.208 --> 16:46.583
You screwed up.

16:46.667 --> 16:47.959
Don't screw this up.

16:49.333 --> 16:52.750
I put dirtbags away.
You do the paperwork.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.458
Can't handle a strong woman,
can you?

16:55.542 --> 16:57.375
No, maybe I just don't like you.

16:57.458 --> 17:00.000
Broken wing's more your type.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.083
- You don't know me.
- Yeah. I do.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.250
Can't stand it, huh?

17:07.333 --> 17:08.917
Stand what?

17:13.333 --> 17:15.625
That I can handle you.

17:37.709 --> 17:39.041
(Will)
'So, how'd it go, Kiril?'

17:39.125 --> 17:40.709
'Mike steals away
one of your girls'

17:40.792 --> 17:42.500
so you have him killed?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.417
[chuckling
]
My girls?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.750
I'd love to help you gents,
but you got the wrong guy.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.291
Cut the BS.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.750
A witness saw you loading
those girls into a van.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.583
Oh, look, I was
just a driver.

17:55.667 --> 17:59.500
I picked up the girls, TVs,
whatever needed delivering.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.000
You work for Nachalneek?

18:02.083 --> 18:04.542
Nah, just,
just heard the name.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.667
But friendly advice?

18:07.750 --> 18:09.625
You might as well stop looking.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.000
Why's that?

18:11.083 --> 18:13.667
You talk about Nachalneek,
you disappear.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.667
(Will)
'So where'd you take
the girls and those TVs?'

18:16.750 --> 18:20.875
That's where my memory fails
me.
Sorry, gents.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.208
Lay of the land, Kiril.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.000
You're looking at 20
in federal prison.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.000
[laughing]
For what?

18:33.083 --> 18:34.333
Trafficking.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.834
Witness, remember?

18:35.917 --> 18:39.709
Unless you prefer a murder
charge for Mike Chulaski.

18:39.792 --> 18:40.917
I never killed nobody.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.500
Help us with
Mike's murder

18:42.583 --> 18:44.250
do a reduced sentence.

18:46.750 --> 18:48.542
So where'd you take Lena?

18:48.625 --> 18:51.625
Some...crap building.

18:51.709 --> 18:53.542
12 Pearl Street.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.667
What went on there?

18:54.750 --> 18:58.625
Dump full of underage tail?

18:58.709 --> 19:00.208
What do you think?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.542
And Mike?

19:02.625 --> 19:05.166
Oh, Mike was a dumbass
of epic proportion.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.709
He find you on the docks
after Lena disappeared on him?

19:07.792 --> 19:10.667
Yeah, wanted something
wasn't his property.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.542
(Mike)
'Excuse me.'

19:15.250 --> 19:18.500
- What?
- Excuse me. Can you, uh..

19:18.583 --> 19:20.709
I gotta talk to you.
Can you..

19:22.834 --> 19:24.917
- What?
- Where's Lena?

19:26.208 --> 19:28.709
Curly hair,
yea high.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.792
She's one of your girls.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.458
Oh.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.875
[grunting]
You're a rube.
You're way out of your depth.

19:38.959 --> 19:40.083
Better walk away.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.375
I want her.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.959
- What's that?
- I want her!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.709
You think you can get
your rocks off for
free?

19:50.792 --> 19:53.792
Hey, wake up. It's America.
Nothing's for free.

19:53.875 --> 19:56.083
She's a kid.
It's not like that.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.000
You're begging for this girl,
and you say it ain't for sex?

19:59.083 --> 20:01.875
So what, you wanna
watch TV together?

20:03.208 --> 20:04.667
Admit it!

20:06.500 --> 20:07.875
Alright!

20:10.083 --> 20:11.750
Alright what?

20:11.834 --> 20:15.166
I wanna...bang her.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.709
You were right.

20:18.792 --> 20:20.166
Just..

20:21.250 --> 20:23.834
...tell me where
I can do that.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.333
12 Pearl Street.

20:30.125 --> 20:32.375
Knock yourself out.

20:33.709 --> 20:36.834
Guy was just a horny perv
like all the rest.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.709
That's all I know.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.333
So..

20:41.417 --> 20:43.458
...I'm done, right?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.041
(Will)
Sit your ass down.

20:47.125 --> 20:49.959
Your next stop's
the federal pen.

20:52.583 --> 20:53.917
12 Pearl Street's
abandoned.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.417
Previous tenants
all fake names. Dead
end.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.917
- So, Kiril played us?
- Not quite.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.667
Found a 911 call
for an overdose

21:00.750 --> 21:02.250
to that address
two years back.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.667
Gave the girl's real name.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.291
"Kateryna Yevchenko."

21:06.375 --> 21:08.667
Accurint's got an
address
for her in Long Island.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.125
Town called Bellport.

21:10.208 --> 21:12.834
If Kateryna worked at Pearl
Street, maybe she knew Lena.

21:12.917 --> 21:15.125
And saw Mike
when he came looking for her.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.625
Didn't think
you were coming in.

21:26.709 --> 21:28.208
Me neither.

21:28.291 --> 21:31.417
We've got everything covered
if you gotta be somewhere
else.

21:35.917 --> 21:38.792
I'd rather be here
than where I was.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.959
Fair enough.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.417
You have an appointment?

22:11.500 --> 22:13.125
Kateryna Yevchenko?

22:13.208 --> 22:17.417
Detectives Valens and Miller
from Philadelphia.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.917
We're looking
into a homicide.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.208
Mike Chulaski,
ring a bell?

22:22.291 --> 22:25.417
He came to Pearl Street
looking for a girl named
Lena.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.583
Long time ago.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.250
I don't remember.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.834
That why you OD'd?

22:43.667 --> 22:46.959
What went on
in that place, Kateryna?

22:50.875 --> 22:52.875
Bad as you imagine.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.667
Worse.

22:57.208 --> 22:59.083
We were slaves.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.458
How'd you get out?

23:02.542 --> 23:05.000
Well, after I am too old
for Pearl Street

23:05.083 --> 23:07.500
I go on my own.

23:07.583 --> 23:10.000
I am good, so
I get nest
egg.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.834
What about this guy Mike?

23:17.417 --> 23:20.041
I take money from Mike
to bring him to Lena.

23:21.041 --> 23:23.125
She wasn't with the others?

23:23.208 --> 23:26.500
In different room
because she
resisted.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.125
Another $50.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.417
Mike.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.709
Lena. Oh, God.

23:49.792 --> 23:51.417
They lied about job, Mike.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.166
- I know.
- They lied.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.917
- I'm gonna get you out.
- They won't let you.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.083
They will kill her.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.125
- Shh.
- What's wrong?

24:04.208 --> 24:06.041
My feet.

24:06.125 --> 24:08.667
(Kateryna)
'Cigarette burns.
She can't walk.'

24:08.750 --> 24:10.917
You get her hopes up,
you make it worse for her.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.041
You cannot save her.

24:12.125 --> 24:13.750
I'm not leaving
you
here, Lena.

24:13.834 --> 24:15.375
I can't walk, Mike.

24:15.458 --> 24:18.125
[footsteps approaching]
Nachalneek's coming.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.208
Listen, this
necklace,
you see this?

24:21.291 --> 24:22.500
It's St. Nicholas.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.500
He'll keep you safe
until I come back.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.917
I've seen you before.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.250
You should know better, Katya.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.458
- Get him out.
- 'Mike, no.'

24:43.542 --> 24:45.041
(Lena)
'Don't leave me here.'

24:45.125 --> 24:48.375
Mike, don't leave me here.
Don't leave me.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.709
Don't leave me here!

24:49.792 --> 24:50.792
Don't leave me here!

24:50.875 --> 24:52.917
I'll come back for you,
I promise!

24:54.625 --> 24:58.208
Come back and you're dead.

25:03.834 --> 25:06.333
Nachalneek was Boyka?

25:08.208 --> 25:10.709
I will never
testify
against her.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.542
That was her thing?

25:12.625 --> 25:14.125
The burning?

25:14.208 --> 25:16.458
What she did to us.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.041
Punishment.

25:23.834 --> 25:26.542
So Mike promises
he's going back for Lena..

25:27.834 --> 25:31.542
Winds up with
Boyka's signature on him.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.959
So you're the famous Nachalneek.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.333
Lot of people
looking for
you.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.667
Nachalneek just means boss.

25:53.750 --> 25:55.291
Could be anyone.

25:55.375 --> 25:57.125
There's a witness.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.125
This person wants to testify?

25:59.208 --> 26:00.792
(John)
'The FBI is charging you
with violation'

26:00.875 --> 26:03.417
of the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act.

26:04.750 --> 26:08.083
And this person
wants to testify?

26:16.333 --> 26:17.625
That's their issue.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.166
We have you for murder.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.834
Mike Chulaski.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.000
I don't know who that is.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.000
You met him when he came
looking for Lena

26:27.083 --> 26:29.709
one of your girls.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.333
Winds up dead
with your trademark

26:31.417 --> 26:33.000
cigarette burns on him.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.083
Someone has framed me.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.250
You got to do better
than that, boss.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
I'm happy to.

26:43.083 --> 26:45.625
Honesty is the best policy.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.667
(Mike)
'Let me in!'

26:50.750 --> 26:52.834
'I'm not leavin'!'

27:03.917 --> 27:06.166
You are risking your life
for nothing.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.959
What do you want
for her, money?

27:08.041 --> 27:10.250
'I need a young one.'

27:10.333 --> 27:12.000
Take Kateryna instead.

27:12.083 --> 27:16.041
Blonde, beautiful...doesn't
complain.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.375
I want Lena.

27:19.458 --> 27:22.458
Everybody left her,
but not me. I won't.

27:22.542 --> 27:24.041
You can't afford Lena.

27:24.125 --> 27:27.375
I'll give you $50,000.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.750
You have this kind of money?

27:30.834 --> 27:32.375
- I'll get it.
- 'Hmm.'

27:34.125 --> 27:37.792
She has potential,
but she's difficult.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.625
Get the money,
you can have her.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.875
Kiril will contact you.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.875
(Lilly)
'So Mike and
Kiril met up?'

27:49.959 --> 27:51.166
Starlight Motel.

27:51.250 --> 27:54.208
Kiril went for my money,
but I never saw it

27:54.291 --> 27:56.417
or Lena
or Kiril again.

27:57.709 --> 28:00.208
- You're locked up, Boyka.
- On what charge?

28:00.291 --> 28:02.250
Prostitution
and
conspiracy.

28:03.917 --> 28:06.125
I'll be in jail one night.

28:06.208 --> 28:08.291
Don't fool yourselves.

28:08.375 --> 28:11.709
But thank you
for finding him. Kiril.

28:11.792 --> 28:14.083
He's in custody.
You can't touch him.

28:14.166 --> 28:16.000
Oh, no?

28:26.792 --> 28:28.959
(Scotty)
'You got stones, Kiril.'

28:29.041 --> 28:30.667
'Turned on Nachalneek.'

28:30.750 --> 28:34.166
Pocketed Mike's money,
killed him at the motel swap.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.375
Who told you that?

28:37.458 --> 28:39.417
Nachalneek herself.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.291
AKA Boyka.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.208
- She know I talked to you?
- Yeah.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.500
You two got a lot to sort out.

28:46.583 --> 28:48.625
Maybe they should talk
face-to-face.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.125
You got to get me
out of general population.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.000
You want that,
you better start singing.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.792
For starters, how is it
you're
in a motel room with Mike

28:58.875 --> 29:01.375
and he ends up
with his head bashed in?

29:02.417 --> 29:04.208
Okay, I'll tell you.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.250
Just protect me from her.

29:08.333 --> 29:10.083
Listenin'.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.333
I got two rooms
at this motel on Point
Breeze.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.667
Why two?

29:18.750 --> 29:21.667
I met Mike in
one,
Lena's in the
other.

29:22.792 --> 29:25.333
The plan was,
when I got the
cash

29:25.417 --> 29:28.000
I'd call Lena,
bring her to him.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.542
That was pretty
cloak-and-dagger.

29:29.625 --> 29:31.625
Its Boyka's idea.

29:31.709 --> 29:33.959
That way, Mike would
never know where Lena was

29:34.041 --> 29:35.417
'if he got stupid.'

29:35.500 --> 29:36.709
Mike bring the money?

29:36.792 --> 29:39.667
No. The dumbass
got stupid
again.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.333
- $50,000.
- I got eight grand here.

29:44.417 --> 29:46.375
And I got the rest
coming from a loan.

29:46.458 --> 29:48.375
'I'll get you the rest,
I swear.'

29:48.458 --> 29:50.083
Deal's off.

29:51.583 --> 29:52.917
I got a boat.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.041
It's a beauty.

29:57.125 --> 29:58.542
Perfect, actually.

29:58.625 --> 29:59.709
I don't need a boat.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.792
You'll make
money on
this.

30:01.875 --> 30:05.917
You could sell it,
get $70,000 in a
heartbeat.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.208
70? How do you figure?

30:08.291 --> 30:11.792
I spent the last ten
years
of my life fixing it
up.

30:11.875 --> 30:14.542
I mean it.
It's a prize.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.709
That's coming from you, though.

30:16.792 --> 30:18.625
You're a capital T tool.

30:18.709 --> 30:19.709
Go look at it.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.375
Tacony Marina, slip 220.

30:23.792 --> 30:24.917
Keys.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.291
I'm not giving them up
without Lena.

30:29.125 --> 30:31.709
Forget it, then.

30:31.792 --> 30:33.583
You take the boat.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.250
I take her.

30:36.250 --> 30:39.000
She's my family now.

30:48.875 --> 30:52.333
Your boyfriend's acting
like a dumbass, as per usual.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.500
'So sit pretty.
I'll be back in an hour.'

30:59.500 --> 31:01.500
Stay put.

31:01.583 --> 31:03.041
(Nick)
'Mike was still alive
when you left?'

31:03.125 --> 31:04.875
[phone ringing]
Yeah.

31:04.959 --> 31:06.959
Watching me from
the door, that
idiot.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.875
- 'Yeah.'
- And when you got back?

31:08.959 --> 31:11.417
(Kiril)
'Head's smashed in..'

31:11.500 --> 31:13.083
...boat keys missing.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.750
Lena still in the other room?

31:14.834 --> 31:17.875
You think I stuck around
to find out?

31:18.959 --> 31:20.750
I screwed up a job
for Boyka.

31:20.834 --> 31:23.458
- That's the end of the road.
- 'Alright, thanks.'

31:23.542 --> 31:25.208
I got lost.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.000
Miller found Mike's boat.

31:36.083 --> 31:38.917
The marina
up in Connecticut.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.333
(Nick)
'Find an owner?'

31:40.417 --> 31:41.750
Guy says he bought it
in cash here in Philly

31:41.834 --> 31:44.166
from a young girl,
foreign accent.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.417
Lena.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.333
Kid didn't have a heart
of gold after all.

31:48.417 --> 31:49.834
Guard!

32:00.709 --> 32:01.709
Kiril give this up?

32:01.792 --> 32:03.208
New house run by Boyka.

32:03.291 --> 32:05.208
Thinking one of these girls
knows where Lena ran?

32:05.291 --> 32:06.417
Locked in a house together.

32:06.500 --> 32:08.583
Must've shared
something.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.834
Don't really want to see this.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.291
Lena?

33:14.667 --> 33:16.166
'Lena.'

33:17.792 --> 33:20.000
I'm not Lena.

33:20.083 --> 33:21.875
Lena, we found Mike's boat.

33:21.959 --> 33:23.250
Stop calling me that.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.583
It's not my name.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.917
'You want to forget
who you used to be?'

33:28.166 --> 33:31.166
When you first came here,
met Mike.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.291
'He saved you.'

33:34.375 --> 33:36.750
I know you remember.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.417
'Cause you kept his necklace.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.166
That thing.

33:42.250 --> 33:43.417
I don't know what it is.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.375
You remember, Lena.

33:45.458 --> 33:47.750
How Mike told you'd always
be
safe with this necklace

33:47.834 --> 33:49.375
and how you betrayed him.

33:52.125 --> 33:55.875
Me betray him?

33:55.959 --> 33:57.041
I did not!

33:57.125 --> 34:00.083
You took his money,
and you left him to
die.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.000
He is dead?

34:04.792 --> 34:06.458
He was murdered.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.125
Mike said..

34:12.208 --> 34:17.834
...in America, people do
things,
to be kind.

34:17.917 --> 34:20.083
But they don't.

34:20.166 --> 34:22.542
Mike didn't want anything
from you?

34:25.041 --> 34:27.250
That's right.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.208
Not from me.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.625
His house is a boat.

34:33.709 --> 34:35.208
Ow!

34:35.291 --> 34:37.125
I make you look nice.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.458
Sit still.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.750
And he says that
you never are dizzy

34:40.834 --> 34:42.959
after you live there
for a few days.

34:43.041 --> 34:47.542
And he say I can go to
school
for free, no problem.

34:47.625 --> 34:49.375
- Ow!
- Shh.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.625
I don't want you to get
your hopes up, little duck.

34:52.709 --> 34:56.166
But Mike promised me.

34:56.250 --> 35:00.709
How many times I've seen people
in this country tell lies.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.166
Not Mike.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.250
He is different
from everybody.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.709
Mike?

35:13.792 --> 35:17.417
(Kiril)
'Your boyfriend's acting
like a dumbass, as per
usual.'

35:17.500 --> 35:20.417
'So sit pretty.
I'll be back in an hour.'

35:28.250 --> 35:29.625
It is Mike?

35:31.375 --> 35:32.875
'Lenushka.'

35:33.917 --> 35:36.041
I am so sorry.

35:37.375 --> 35:38.458
What?

35:38.542 --> 35:41.250
It is good
you did not hope too much.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.375
What did he say?

35:45.458 --> 35:48.417
Mike wants a girlfriend..

35:48.500 --> 35:50.875
...for sex.

35:50.959 --> 35:53.083
'He asked for me..'

35:53.834 --> 35:56.250
'...the pretty one.'

35:58.792 --> 36:00.792
My poor little duck.

36:03.792 --> 36:07.875
He said he would come for me.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.542
He wants me now.

36:16.709 --> 36:18.208
Stay here.

36:19.875 --> 36:22.583
Someone will
come for you.

36:39.166 --> 36:41.333
I gave up hope
like she said.

36:43.417 --> 36:46.000
Doesn't hurt anymore.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.041
Wait. He came for you.

36:52.417 --> 36:54.208
Not Kateryna.

36:54.291 --> 36:56.750
She lied...not Mike.

36:56.834 --> 36:58.375
No.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.959
They all lie.

37:00.041 --> 37:01.709
He gave up his boat

37:01.792 --> 37:04.458
to get you
from Nachalneek.

37:05.834 --> 37:09.000
His boat is...is where he live.

37:09.083 --> 37:11.500
And he was
willing to give it up.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.333
For me?

37:19.291 --> 37:21.959
He was killed
trying to save
you.

37:24.333 --> 37:27.917
He said that you
were his family.

37:38.291 --> 37:41.083
(Will)
'Get what you wanted,
Kateryna?'

37:41.166 --> 37:42.500
I earn it all.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.834
I work very hard to
get what I deserve.

37:44.917 --> 37:46.583
The American dream.

37:46.667 --> 37:49.625
Now I can be new person,
hold my head up.

37:49.709 --> 37:51.834
Every dream
takes sacrifice.

37:51.917 --> 37:53.792
What was yours?

37:56.083 --> 37:58.125
I sold my body.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.542
Does things to you.

38:00.625 --> 38:01.959
Makes you
desperate.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.333
You were at the motel.

38:04.417 --> 38:06.458
(Will)
'Went to Mike's room,
night he died.'

38:06.542 --> 38:07.667
(Scotty)
'You lied to Lena.'

38:07.750 --> 38:09.667
Said Mike didn't want
to save her.

38:09.750 --> 38:10.667
He didn't.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.041
He was like all the others.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.375
Like the other men
who hurt you?

38:14.458 --> 38:17.875
Why'd you take away her chance
to have a decent life?

38:17.959 --> 38:20.750
I was dying in that house, too.

38:20.834 --> 38:22.583
So you killed a man.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.542
Finally get
something
for yourself.

38:25.625 --> 38:28.709
You don't
understand
what it was like.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.542
How could you?

38:31.667 --> 38:35.041
[sniffles]
Ten men a day?

38:35.125 --> 38:38.291
Spitting on you,
ripping you apart.

38:40.250 --> 38:43.834
When I first got there
I resisted, too.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.709
I used to believe
someone would come

38:48.792 --> 38:52.583
and take me away.

38:52.667 --> 38:54.625
But no one came.

38:54.709 --> 38:56.417
Mike did.

38:57.667 --> 38:59.959
Not for me.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.458
You've seen Lena?

39:09.959 --> 39:11.917
Where has Kiril gone?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.333
Huh?

39:13.417 --> 39:16.000
Uh, to see my boat.

39:16.083 --> 39:18.625
I'm giving it to
him
for Lena.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.583
Where's Lena?
Is she okay?

39:22.667 --> 39:24.333
She is not here.

39:25.875 --> 39:28.375
Now relax, Daddy.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.875
Yes, yes.

39:30.959 --> 39:33.125
Did something happen to her?

39:34.667 --> 39:37.000
Okay. Get off me!

39:38.667 --> 39:39.875
Choose me instead.

39:39.959 --> 39:42.458
I am much better.

39:42.542 --> 39:45.917
You want me to be sister,
daughter?

39:46.000 --> 39:49.417
- Please. I will.
- What are you doing?

39:49.500 --> 39:52.291
Don't make me go back
to that house.

39:52.375 --> 39:56.041
Mike, you are a nice man.

39:56.125 --> 39:57.792
I give you anything.

39:57.875 --> 40:01.125
I just want
Lena.
That's all.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.083
[sobbing]
No, no. Help me.

40:03.166 --> 40:06.458
I'll help you
once I've got her,
okay?

40:06.542 --> 40:08.375
- Please.
- Can't let her down.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.125
I'm all she has.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.917
I want somebody to care for me
so I am not alone.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.333
I'm sorry.

40:21.750 --> 40:24.166
I got to find Lena.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.333
What about me?

40:31.333 --> 40:34.000
I gotta go.
I'm sorry.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.000
What about me?

40:40.041 --> 40:41.917
What about me?
