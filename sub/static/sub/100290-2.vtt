00:14.320 --> 00:16.000
Circle, message.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.720
Due to lack of dialogue

00:18.800 --> 00:22.440
and suspicions of catfishing...

00:23.000 --> 00:24.280
Fuck!

00:24.360 --> 00:26.080
...the blocked person is...

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
Send.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.880
I don't want to look.

00:29.960 --> 00:30.920
Help!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.960
I hope it's not me. Please.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.640
Oh, boy.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.280
Everybody must be freaking out.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.160
This is so intense, man.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.880
Please, God!

00:42.680 --> 00:43.640
"Ana Carla."

00:45.200 --> 00:48.000
Holy shit! It's not me, thank God!

00:48.080 --> 00:49.880
-Fuck yeah!
-Geez.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.520
Jesus Christ.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.600
The game's still on!

00:57.560 --> 00:59.440
ANA CARLA HAS BEEN BLOCKED
FROM THE CIRCLE

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
This is so sad.

01:05.080 --> 01:06.840
This is really sad.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.800
"Blocked."

01:14.880 --> 01:19.240
Wow, she's not on the screen anymore!

01:19.320 --> 01:20.840
She's been removed already.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.720
She couldn't even defend herself.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.400
Oh, wow.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.080
Such heavy energy.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.240
Ana Carla...

01:34.200 --> 01:35.240
is gone.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.160
She was probably a catfish.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.640
Who knows?

01:38.720 --> 01:41.240
I like real people.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.560
Holy cow.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.520
ALERT!

01:51.600 --> 01:53.160
Alert! Another alert!

01:53.480 --> 01:56.320
Things are going wild today!
Things are going wild!

01:57.760 --> 01:59.360
They can't eliminate more people.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.640
-"Before leaving..."
-"...Ana Carla can meet..."

02:03.720 --> 02:05.840
"...one player in person."

02:05.920 --> 02:10.320
Oh... my... God!

02:10.400 --> 02:12.760
Can you imagine if she's not a catfish?

02:13.920 --> 02:17.840
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fakest of them all?

02:17.920 --> 02:19.760
Who is she going to pick?

02:21.400 --> 02:23.080
Do I wear a hat? My hair is fine.

02:23.160 --> 02:25.480
I'm nervous. What if she comes over?

02:25.560 --> 02:27.880
I think she's going to pick JP.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.880
Is she coming here?

02:35.280 --> 02:38.320
"Ana Carla is on her way
to one of the apartments."

02:38.400 --> 02:40.400
Holy fuck!

02:40.480 --> 02:41.960
What if it's me?

02:42.040 --> 02:43.560
Lord help me!

02:43.640 --> 02:46.240
What am I going to say if she comes here?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.360
That's unbelievable, dude.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.960
Come over, girl.
Stop by, if you want.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.280
Lord have mercy!

03:07.840 --> 03:09.280
Holy mother of God.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.680
Hello!

03:23.240 --> 03:25.840
Who's a catfish, my love?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.920
Oh, my God!

03:30.000 --> 03:31.560
Look at this apartment!

03:31.720 --> 03:35.400
I can't believe it!

03:36.000 --> 03:38.400
-What's up?
-Girl...

03:39.240 --> 03:41.920
I cried so much, my makeup is gone.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.520
Don't say this, girlfriend.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.040
-Let's have a sit.
-Okay.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.680
Wow, your voice, your charisma...
You seem so amazing.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.520
I knew right away you weren't a catfish.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.320
-Who do you think is a catfish?
-I think Gaybol is.

04:00.840 --> 04:03.200
-Gaybol?
-Yes, Gaybol. I think.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.320
But my photo was kinda...

04:05.400 --> 04:06.800
Yeah, it was.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.320
It looked...

04:08.400 --> 04:09.960
-Too much.
-...too much.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.160
-Way too much.
-But most of my photos are like that.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.560
Honey, a photo on the beach
would've saved you.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.880
I don't know if I'm relieved or upset.

04:24.840 --> 04:27.760
But unfortunately, she didn't come over.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.120
And why did you come to visit me?

04:31.200 --> 04:34.240
Because... I wanted you to see
I'm not a catfish.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.400
I believe you thought I was.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.480
You were the first person
I could relate to when I saw the profiles.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.960
When I saw your photo, I said,

04:43.040 --> 04:46.440
"Wow, I love him.
We're gonna be friends, allies.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.120
We'll go very far in the game."
I want to cry again.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.480
-Honey...
-I'm emotional.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.760
-Give me your hand.
-Then I thought...

04:54.520 --> 04:55.560
Calm down.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.440
Look at how blessed you are.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.640
For real. This is my dream,

04:59.840 --> 05:02.080
and I know it's a dream for you too.

05:02.160 --> 05:07.640
Honey, I wish you the best
from here on out.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.680
-Thanks.
-Let's be there for each other.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.320
Let's be there for each other!

05:11.400 --> 05:13.040
I loved meeting Dumaresq.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.200
<i>He's a really nice guy.</i>

05:15.280 --> 05:17.040
I'm rooting for you.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.960
-Or JP. He's a northeasterner too.
-Nice.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.000
He's like most of my friends.
Really cheerful,

05:24.080 --> 05:25.160
really nice.

05:25.840 --> 05:26.920
Really jolly.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.800
-You're so pretty!
-Hey, I love this apartment.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.880
-Wow.
-Kisses.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.040
-Kisses.
-Bye.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.880
-All the best to you.
-You too.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.840
<i>He was my competition.</i>

05:38.760 --> 05:41.560
And even so, he was able to comfort me.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.600
I was moved when she said
she wanted me to see

05:44.680 --> 05:46.680
she was not a catfish.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.840
She cared about my opinion.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.440
She cares about my opinion.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.800
He's everything I imagined and more.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.080
This is so emotional.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.200
<i>"Emotional" doesn't even cover it.</i>

06:01.760 --> 06:05.520
<i>But there's nothing like</i>
<i>a good night's sleep to calm things down.</i>

06:05.600 --> 06:06.840
One day down.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.200
It was a long day.

06:16.280 --> 06:19.000
What a long day, guys.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.760
So much happened.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.760
We've been through a lot today.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.160
What a day.

06:27.640 --> 06:29.120
I almost broke the bed.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.960
<i>Let's go to bed and stop thinking.</i>
<i>But remember,</i>

06:32.040 --> 06:34.080
<i>you reap what you sow.</i>

06:34.160 --> 06:35.320
<i>#LifeHack.</i>

06:35.400 --> 06:36.680
Good night, Circle.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.080
Circle, baby.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.880
For you, it's just "night."

06:40.960 --> 06:43.880
It'd be a "good night"
if you were in bed with me.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.160
I like you.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
Cutie.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.200
Good night, baby.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.560
<i>He's so frisky.</i>

07:02.960 --> 07:04.600
<i>Good morning, players.</i>

07:04.680 --> 07:06.240
<i>Ready for the next phase?</i>

07:06.320 --> 07:09.120
Good morning, Circle!

07:09.880 --> 07:12.040
It started all over again.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.960
You sassy Circle.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.000
Thank you, Duma! Thank you, Marina!

07:17.080 --> 07:19.120
You both saved our necks.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.880
I can't wait to see
how it's gonna be from now on.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.920
A lot happened to me yesterday.

07:26.720 --> 07:29.080
Today, I want some peace.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.960
Please. For the love of God.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.560
<i>Get over it, Duma,</i>

07:34.640 --> 07:37.440
<i>and enjoy that crown</i>
<i>because it won't be yours forever.</i>

07:38.200 --> 07:40.560
My strategy from now on is...

07:41.040 --> 07:43.160
to hunt down the leaders.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.360
I have to make new connections

07:46.440 --> 07:49.080
because to be popular, you don't have

07:49.160 --> 07:52.240
to talk to the influencers.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.600
You have to be an influencer too.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.120
Let's play. Money doesn't grow on trees.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.200
<i>The definition of "working out"</i>

<i>Here you have to hold on</i>
<i>to your popularity</i>

08:11.760 --> 08:12.720

08:18.960 --> 08:23.320
<i>Come on, Duma. Don't pretend</i>
<i>you don't know what that means.</i>

08:23.400 --> 08:25.280
From "single" to "stressed out."

08:34.280 --> 08:36.200
Devastated!

08:36.280 --> 08:37.920
Lonely!

08:38.000 --> 08:38.960
I'm kidding.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.080
Circle, message. Yesterday was stressful,

08:42.160 --> 08:45.200
I won't deny it. But today is a new day,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.840
but I think her only problem

09:10.040 --> 09:11.520
is that she likes attention.

God help me.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.760
I don't think...

12:12.000 --> 12:14.640
Julia's status is interesting at all.

12:14.720 --> 12:17.800
I'm so over this Auntie hashtag.
It doesn't add anything.

12:18.360 --> 12:22.200
Duma and Marina didn't like our status.

12:22.280 --> 12:25.840
Maybe they saw it and thought,
"Well, I didn't like it."

12:26.920 --> 12:29.080
It could look suspicious.

12:29.160 --> 12:32.200
One of my goals now
is to get Marina to like me,

12:32.280 --> 12:34.000
or shit's gonna hit the fan.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.280
They're gonna destroy us.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.680
<i>Be strong, Julia. Because you're clueless.</i>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.760
<i>You better forget this Auntie thing.</i>

13:02.880 --> 13:04.240
What's going to happen?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.400
Circle, open my newsfeed.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.360
Whoa.

13:13.440 --> 13:17.000
"Before leaving,
Ana Carla left a message."

13:20.640 --> 13:22.800
This is so crazy, dude.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.600
The time has come.
Time to find out the truth.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.040
Circle, open Ana Carla's video.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.960

13:40.720 --> 13:42.760
<i>That's right, the real Ana Carla.</i>

13:42.840 --> 13:45.360
The model, the DJ.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.120
Yes, Miss Paraíba, baby.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.680
Holy shit!

13:49.760 --> 13:53.040
I'm from Paraíba,
proud to be a northeasterner. Yes, sir!

13:53.600 --> 13:55.000
Whoa, Mouse.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.560
Dude, I'm shocked. It's impossible.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.240
Akel must be in shock!

14:00.320 --> 14:02.400
I'm not a catfish. You were wrong.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.040
I'm in love.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.640
Shit, she really wasn't a catfish.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.040
The girl is so hot, dude!

14:12.120 --> 14:14.640
You guys were so wrong.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.160
<i>I'm really crazy, I'm a mess,</i>
<i>I'm not perfect at all.</i>

14:19.640 --> 14:23.880
If she had used a photo
where she looked natural,

14:23.960 --> 14:26.320
she would still be here. Wow.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.840
Fuck. We were wrong.

14:30.720 --> 14:34.440
I hope you all have lots of fun.
Have a great game.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.680
But I'm rooting
for the northeasterners, okay?

14:37.760 --> 14:38.680
<i>Kisses.</i>

14:39.200 --> 14:40.040
<i>Bye.</i>

14:40.120 --> 14:42.400
I'm moving to the northeast, for sure.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.400
I think she's rooting for me.

14:44.480 --> 14:45.640
I hope so.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.200
We have to be more careful with what we...

14:50.120 --> 14:52.800
think and say about people, right?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.000
It was not your time, girl.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.400
Maybe who I thought was a catfish
is not a catfish?

14:58.280 --> 15:01.120
And who I thought was not a catfish
<i>is</i> a catfish?

15:01.240 --> 15:04.520
I'm even more confused now. Shit.

15:04.840 --> 15:08.320
<i>The game has barely started,</i>
<i>and Gaybol is already stuck.</i>

15:08.800 --> 15:12.360
Yeah, maybe she was sent home too early.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.240
<i>A little too late to be sorry, sis.</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:17.120
<i>The game's still on.</i>

15:21.640 --> 15:23.480
<i>Earth to Gaybol.</i>

15:23.560 --> 15:24.480
Check it out.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.960
We have one less player
in our circle of people.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.640
Where's Ana's scowl?

15:31.040 --> 15:33.200
Not a scowl. She's a beautiful princess.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.440
We're only eight now.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.040
Now, more than ever,
I have to prove to those people

15:39.800 --> 15:42.240
that I'm not a catfish, I'm real.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.560
There were four girls before.
Now, there are only three.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.000
We have to be smart, girls.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.920
The first elimination has showed us

15:50.000 --> 15:52.480
how to behave, what to do

15:52.600 --> 15:55.400
in order to stay longer in the game.

15:55.480 --> 15:59.640
I wonder if it's only eight players now,
or if more people will join.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.520
We can expect anything from <i>The Circle.</i>

16:05.440 --> 16:07.320
<i>Since anything can happen,</i>

16:07.400 --> 16:10.200
<i>you better add everybody as a friend.</i>

16:14.400 --> 16:18.120
<i>Without Ana Carla around,</i>
<i>JP probably needs an ally.</i>

16:23.640 --> 16:29.360
Look at that!
"JP has invited you to a private chat."

16:29.440 --> 16:32.800
I think it's important to have this chat

16:32.880 --> 16:36.040
so we can get closer,
and see what we have in common.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.960
I'll get to know his personality better.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.800
Yes, she was.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.360
She told me a lot of stuff,

17:29.440 --> 17:32.480
including her suspicions

17:33.080 --> 17:34.600
on a potential catfish.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.080
Gaybol.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.880
"I think he's dangerous.
He said he's only here to play."

Man, that's some juicy information.

Circle, message.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.720
I also suspect Gaybol.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.800

17:50.880 --> 17:53.440
#NortheasternDuo.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.680
"NortheasternDuo."
I wouldn't call it that.

17:56.760 --> 18:01.080
I'm not forming an alliance with you
just like that, "bro." Take it slow.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.920

18:44.360 --> 18:46.360

Lorayne, I was lost in your beauty

She's hitting on everybody.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.520
Julia, you're crazy.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.680
Do you know what Auntie looks like?

24:14.000 --> 24:16.640
Those men who check women out

24:16.720 --> 24:18.880
and say stupid shit to them.

24:19.440 --> 24:20.560
Woman, please,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.720
have some class.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.960
He doesn't tell dirty jokes,
doesn't talk much.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.520
Maybe Sagittarius?

24:38.600 --> 24:40.400
I think Lucas is a Libra.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.400
He seems to be a stable person.

But, from your point of view
and from mine,

24:51.800 --> 24:54.640
I'm much more than fire
and wild passion.

25:06.920 --> 25:11.000
Look at that! Being all flirty, Marina?

25:11.080 --> 25:13.360
Nice. Lucas is really charming.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.600
See? The quiet ones always win.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.920
Trust me, never shoot in every direction.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.240
Aim on the target.

25:22.920 --> 25:25.600
Marina was so direct with Lucas.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.000
Very nice.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.880
"What is Marina's sign?"

25:29.960 --> 25:30.920

Julia is flirting with everybody. Weird.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.280
Whoa.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.320
I'm shocked,
she hits on me just like that.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.160
There's a nymphomaniac...

26:52.160 --> 26:54.920
I think Julia is really diving

26:55.000 --> 26:57.920
into the dirty stuff,
being too aggressive.

Men like to team up,
to feel like they belong to a group.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.040
Is this a men's club, Lucas?

What could it be?

28:12.680 --> 28:15.760
How about another topic?
Something that would include me.

28:15.840 --> 28:16.960
But all right, Lucas.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.160
I get along better with girls.

adding me to this group chat.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.240
Is it pronounced "headtag" or "hashtag?"

30:12.200 --> 30:15.840
Wow, that's bad.

30:15.920 --> 30:17.040
I knew he would leave.

30:17.120 --> 30:18.600
Please, honey.

30:18.680 --> 30:22.800
I don't want to be in a group chat
with a bunch of straight men.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.640
Look at me. For God's sake.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.680
Attitude like that makes us
a little suspicious.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.600
How could he leave like that?

30:30.680 --> 30:34.280
It looks like he didn't want
to bond with the guys.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.960
Group chats are like that.
And nobody's acknowledging what happened.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.080
Circle, message.

30:41.160 --> 30:44.400
Damn, comma,
he could've given it a chance.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.400

30:52.840 --> 30:55.480

30:59.680 --> 31:01.080
I think it's weird

31:01.440 --> 31:03.200
that Dumaresq left like that.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.080
He has a strong personality.

31:05.160 --> 31:08.080
Maybe he thought the group was sexist.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.360
I'm glad I wasn't the one who created it.

31:10.440 --> 31:11.840

31:12.440 --> 31:15.840
I created the group as a way

31:37.120 --> 31:38.480
There's no team.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.600
Lucas, bro, the group is a great idea.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.040

31:52.080 --> 31:53.440
I don't agree with it.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.360
It's too early to form a clique like that

31:56.440 --> 31:57.920
and to be in a group.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.960
Okay, dominoes, you won.

32:22.640 --> 32:25.480
Thank God! I needed that.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.840

32:54.320 --> 32:57.960
<i>It's party time, shake it</i>

32:58.040 --> 33:00.600

Holy...

33:25.800 --> 33:30.960
Oh... my... God!

33:31.040 --> 33:33.000
Two boxes. Now we're talking.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.080
I can't wait to open them, dude.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.840
I'm scared. I don't want to open them.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.760
I'm scared.

33:39.840 --> 33:41.840
Holy cow, I'm nervous.

33:42.480 --> 33:43.760
What's in the box?

33:47.920 --> 33:50.400
No way!

33:53.520 --> 33:55.000
It's <i>caipirinha!</i>

33:55.080 --> 33:56.080
<i>Caipirinha.</i>

33:56.160 --> 33:58.760
This word just gives me the chills.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.080
"Ingredients: one lime, four ice cubes..."

34:02.160 --> 34:03.720
Holy fuck!

34:03.800 --> 34:05.360
There's a lime.

34:05.440 --> 34:07.320
It looks good, smells great.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.600
<i>Caipirinha</i> is my specialty.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.600
A teeny-tiny <i>cachaça!</i>

34:11.920 --> 34:13.440
Hell yeah!

34:13.520 --> 34:16.720
<i>Cachaça.</i> There's also this thing
to make <i>caipirinha.</i>

34:18.520 --> 34:22.800
Look at this outfit!

34:23.440 --> 34:25.720
<i>It's so you, girlfriend!</i>

34:25.800 --> 34:28.120
I think they gave me the wrong box.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.160
Oh, my God!

34:30.240 --> 34:31.280
I love it.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.200
I've never worn anything like this.
I don't even know how to put it on.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.600
Is this right?

34:51.400 --> 34:55.000
The most beautiful queen
in this entire house...

34:55.080 --> 34:56.880
is me.

34:59.760 --> 35:00.800
On the catwalk...

35:03.240 --> 35:05.120

35:05.200 --> 35:08.640
Charming, naked, and sexy.

35:11.280 --> 35:14.200
I'm gonna teach you
how to make <i>caipirinha.</i>

35:14.280 --> 35:16.800
This one is made by a bartender.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.920
It's not those lame-ass <i>caipirinhas</i>
you can buy on the streets.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.080
Nice.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.680
"Directions: cut the lime in four pieces."

35:24.760 --> 35:26.320
I've already done that.

35:26.400 --> 35:27.880
I'm gonna use this knife.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.200
Between your fingers.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.840
You won't cut yourself,
and the lime won't slip through.

35:34.920 --> 35:38.760
"Smash the lime and the sugar
with the pestle."

35:39.200 --> 35:41.240
I don't drink <i>cachaça,</i>
but there's no alcohol.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.240
Holy shit!

35:43.320 --> 35:44.600
Smash them a little.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.120
I'm gonna shake this <i>cachaça</i>
to try and make it stronger.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.600
Come on, <i>cachaça.</i> You can do it.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.280
One almost fell off. It worked.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.280
It looks great.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.160
I put it all together, now I can't squeeze
the ice cubes and the lime.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.760
Only five steps, and I've managed to fail.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.080
My <i>caipirinha</i> is a little dull.

36:10.880 --> 36:14.080
It's my first time making a drink.
It looks kind of...

36:14.600 --> 36:15.640
kind of nice.

36:18.840 --> 36:22.240
I would love to see
what the players are wearing.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.280
I'd give anything to see Julia now,

36:25.680 --> 36:27.000
in an odalisque costume.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.680
<i>If you only knew...</i>

36:29.760 --> 36:32.120
<i>Cachaça</i> is like water in the desert.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.200
Let the music play, so we can dance.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.280
No way!

36:41.080 --> 36:43.560
The club lights are on.

36:54.200 --> 36:55.320
Look at me dancing.

37:11.560 --> 37:12.760
A true samba dancer.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.680
Do you think I only play video games?
There are dancing games too.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.480
How's my energy? Up high.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.040
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.400
<i>Samba and </i>caipirinha,<i> the best duo.</i>

37:33.400 --> 37:34.480
<i>But hold on.</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:37.120
<i>Somebody is late to the party.</i>

38:00.200 --> 38:02.600
What the hell?

38:02.680 --> 38:04.800
Oh, wow.

38:05.080 --> 38:05.920
It's huge.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.960
Can I live here forever?

38:13.560 --> 38:15.040
Yes or absolutely?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.080
Fierce.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.400
I'm ready.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.800
Let's go, brother.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.840
-Wonder Twin powers...
-Activate.
