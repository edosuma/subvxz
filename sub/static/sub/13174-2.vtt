anything could have happened.

No? No, I...

17:50.506 --> 17:52.356
I just don't want to
light these suckers up

17:52.381 --> 17:54.126
and then have someone bitch at me.

17:54.151 --> 17:56.039
'Cause I ruined a funeral once.

17:56.064 --> 17:57.220
Nobody?

17:57.245 --> 17:58.553
All right, nobody wants to say anything?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.430
I'll say a few words.

18:01.544 --> 18:05.349
Dealing with these bodies today,
I learned something.

18:05.374 --> 18:07.013
I learned that it doesn't matter

18:07.038 --> 18:09.273
what we were before the island.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.634
It doesn't matter what
people thought of us

18:11.659 --> 18:14.433
or if we lost track
of what's important...

18:14.527 --> 18:16.662
if we weren't close to others.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.948
Or, hell, if we were some big weirdo,

18:18.973 --> 18:21.543
like a public masturbator or something.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.652
What matters is we're here now.

18:24.124 --> 18:27.286
We're given a second chance.

18:29.878 --> 18:31.631
Or something like that. I don't know.

18:31.655 --> 18:33.249
I felt like that was
rambling a little bit.

18:33.274 --> 18:35.276
I'm dehydrated. I'm sorry, everybody.

18:35.301 --> 18:38.231
No, Danny, that's quite lovely.

18:38.256 --> 18:39.701
Oh, thanks, Steve.

18:39.725 --> 18:43.530
Karen... I think we should say good-bye.

[Sniffing]

19:07.632 --> 19:11.123
Ugh. What's that smell?!

19:11.148 --> 19:12.545
Is that the bodies?!

19:12.570 --> 19:14.615
- That smells horrible.
- Oh, God.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.051
Is it disrespectful if we leave?

19:16.075 --> 19:18.975
I have no idea, but I'm smelling many,
many things right now.

19:19.001 --> 19:20.634
It smells like burning hair, huh?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.703
[Gags]

19:21.728 --> 19:24.444
Ugh, it smells like a
hundred assholes on fire.

19:24.469 --> 19:26.088
Ugh! I'm gonna throw up!

19:26.113 --> 19:27.201
Blugh!

Eeew!!

19:30.308 --> 19:31.974
Now I'm gonna throw
up. I'm gonna throw up.

19:31.999 --> 19:35.068
- I'm gonna...

19:35.093 --> 19:37.930
It's a puke chain. It's a puke chain!

19:37.955 --> 19:39.468
Ugh! Ugh!

19:39.493 --> 19:41.216
Don't look at each other!

19:41.240 --> 19:42.962
Eeew!!

19:42.988 --> 19:44.644
Everybody get upwind!

[All shouting]

19:52.667 --> 19:56.491
Oh, yuck! Ugh!

20:00.259 --> 20:02.087
Hey, Todd.

20:02.112 --> 20:04.749
Hey. Look what I've got...

20:04.774 --> 20:06.682
some pretzels for you.

20:07.091 --> 20:09.460
Jesus. Steve, are you trying to bang me?

20:09.485 --> 20:12.222
What? No! Why would you say that?

20:12.247 --> 20:15.879
All the gifts and weird leg touching.

20:15.904 --> 20:17.740
Feels like you're
trying to bang me, dude.

20:17.765 --> 20:19.582
I'm not trying to bang you.

20:19.607 --> 20:21.876
I'm comforting you in your time of need.

20:21.901 --> 20:24.266
Todd, you've lost a child.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.826
What?!

20:25.851 --> 20:27.097
Haven't you?

20:27.122 --> 20:28.724
Are you talking about my golf club?

20:28.749 --> 20:30.151
Callaway is a golf club?

20:30.176 --> 20:31.784
You were talking about a golf club?!

20:31.810 --> 20:34.837
You thought I lost a kid? God bless!

20:34.862 --> 20:36.043
You dummy!

20:36.067 --> 20:37.797
Why do you think I was
being so nice to you?!

20:37.822 --> 20:39.776
'Cause you were trying to bang me, man.

20:39.801 --> 20:41.294
Well, I can't believe this!

20:41.320 --> 20:43.219
- Look how angry I am now!
- I see it.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.783
And the things I gave
you! That neck pillow!

20:45.808 --> 20:47.186
Not to mention all the other things!

20:47.212 --> 20:48.290
- The shaving mirror.
- Yeah.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.403
The sketch I did of the
two of us on the beach.

20:50.428 --> 20:51.458
Yeah, that was pretty good.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.521
My handkerchief!

20:52.545 --> 20:54.898
Listen, man,
it's not my fault you're an idiot.

20:54.923 --> 20:56.761
- All right.
- We could just...

20:56.786 --> 20:57.937
Give me that...

20:57.961 --> 20:59.432
- No.
- neck pillow back!

20:59.457 --> 21:00.518
- Come get it!
- Give it!

21:00.543 --> 21:02.690
Come on! It's right here.

21:02.715 --> 21:04.778
Whoa! [Laughing]

Okay, just come here.
