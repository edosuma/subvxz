["Sing, Sing, Sing" playing]

01:14.157 --> 01:16.284
-[music stops]
-[cheering]

01:30.256 --> 01:31.257
Judy Hale.

01:31.883 --> 01:32.884
That's the artist.

01:33.009 --> 01:35.386
Sorry. I'm new here,
so I still need the thingy.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.806
[chuckles] So how much
would a Judy Hale set me back?

01:38.264 --> 01:42.310
Well, between nine and twenty thousand,
depending on the size.

01:42.977 --> 01:43.853
Nine and...

01:44.437 --> 01:45.605
-Jesus!
-Ooh!

01:45.688 --> 01:48.358
Looks like these are all sold.
I guess she's famous or something.

01:48.441 --> 01:49.776
Yeah, I've heard of her.

01:50.151 --> 01:53.780
Hey, so what can you tell me about the '66
Mustang that's usually parked out front?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.115
Oh, I don't know.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.283
Actually, let me go ask my boss.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.284
Cool. Thank you.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.538
[sighs]

02:02.122 --> 02:05.208
[Steve speaking Greek]

02:06.126 --> 02:06.960
-Hey there.
-Hey.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.920
-Hey, Steve Wood.
-Steve?

02:09.254 --> 02:12.799
-Yeah. And you are?
-Dying to know if your Mustang's for sale.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.053
-Sorry. What did you say your name was?
-I didn't.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.973
You know,
I drive by this gallery all the time.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.892
-It doesn't seem like you're ever open.
-It's gallery hours.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.145
-It's a thing. It's a real thing.
-Hmm.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.356
Right. So, the Mustang. Where is it?

02:28.481 --> 02:31.317
Sorry. I'm not gonna be able to help you
with that one, broseph.  Uh...

02:31.401 --> 02:33.444
-Maybe it belongs to one of my artists.
-Oh, yeah?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.155
Yeah. Probably definitely.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.781
Probably definitely Judy Hale?

02:39.492 --> 02:40.326
Uh...

02:42.620 --> 02:45.039
No. I mean, I don't know. I'm not sure.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.292
Why don't you call me if you get sure?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.002
All right. Will do...

02:50.962 --> 02:51.963
Detective.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.257
[door closes]

02:56.384 --> 02:57.635
Judy, your breakfast is ready.

02:58.469 --> 02:59.387
I made it myself.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.057
Oh! Look at you. That is so sweet.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.394
Yeah. It's pancakes.
They're vegan... mostly.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.771
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

03:08.938 --> 03:09.939
[Jen chuckles]

03:10.064 --> 03:10.899
I wouldn't eat that.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.442
-No.
-Seriously?

03:12.984 --> 03:14.986
-It's the thought.
-It is the thought.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.614
How was your dance class?

03:17.780 --> 03:19.115
Oh! It was amazing.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.369
I'm sore as shit right now,
but thank you for making me do that.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.246
How are you doing?

03:26.372 --> 03:29.125
-I'm doing a little better.
-Okay.

03:31.669 --> 03:32.503
No, you're not.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.215
-No, I'm not. I'm sorry.
-Oh, honey, honey.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.174
[Judy sobs]

03:36.424 --> 03:37.634
It's just hard.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.680
I'm trying to process the idea
that I'm never gonna have children.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.725
-You know, you can always adopt.
-[scoffs]

03:46.601 --> 03:49.229
Yeah, I'm 41 and homeless,
send me all your children.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.980
I wouldn't... open with that.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.736
[sniffs] All I ever wanted
was to have a family.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.240
You... you have us.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.659
You're a part of this family.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.287
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.377
-Thank you.
-Oh, gosh.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.128
That was supposed
to make you feel better.

04:14.212 --> 04:15.505
[sobbing] It does.

04:15.588 --> 04:18.383
Mom, I need a new laptop.
Mine's getting old.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.593
Not now, Charlie. Judy's having a moment.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.053
What, so my needs come last?

04:22.512 --> 04:24.597
Do you know how much a new laptop costs?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.808
I can't even swing
the mortgage this month.

04:26.891 --> 04:29.227
So your laptop is a little low on my list.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.897
-Oh, boy.
-[Judy] Wait, what?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.565
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.317
It's just money's a little tight.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.445
-It's very tight.
-Let me contribute.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.030
No.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.241
Can you pay a mortgage with a debit card?

04:43.574 --> 04:45.576
I still have the one
that I shared with Steve.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.911
-You do?
-Yeah.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.456
He has so much money. I never touch it
myself, but he wouldn't miss it.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.334
No. You know, I don't need Steve Wood
paying for my mortgage.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.919
Does Steve wanna buy me a new laptop?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.171
If you want a new laptop, go get a job!

04:57.255 --> 04:59.674
Did Henry need to get a job
to pay for his stupid fucking choir?

04:59.757 --> 05:03.469
[laughs] Yeah. You wanna join the fucking
church choir, sure, I'll pay to see that.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.096
I'd rather get hit by a car.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.309
-You watch your mouth!
-Too late.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.936
Don't you dare disrespect
your father like that ever again!

05:12.020 --> 05:13.855
Me disrespect him?
You are one to fucking talk!

05:13.938 --> 05:14.772
Go to your room!

05:14.856 --> 05:17.358
I'm gonna call Grandma,
because at least she gives a shit.

05:17.442 --> 05:20.820
You know what? You can't go running
to Lorna every time you need something!

05:21.321 --> 05:24.407
Lorna, no one sells like me.
You know that.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.493
I would be a huge asset to this team.

05:27.785 --> 05:29.537
So, you need me.

05:29.912 --> 05:32.081
As much as it pains me
to admit that, yes, I do.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.376
My income has been... really stalled.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.337
Because your business partner dumped you.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.922
-Don't.
-Because you're a real estate pariah.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.674
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lorna!

05:42.008 --> 05:43.843
Isn't it exhausting hating me this much?

05:44.302 --> 05:46.220
-I don't hate you.
-Thank you.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.765
-I'm just consistently disappointed.
-There it is.

05:48.848 --> 05:51.726
You may pretend not to remember,
Jennifer, but I do.

05:52.685 --> 05:56.147
One day, you were my protégé
and then you deserted me,

05:56.230 --> 05:59.734
tempted by whatever fruits
Christopher dangled in your face.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.111
No, I don't think
that's an apt metaphor in this--

06:02.195 --> 06:04.989
Do you have any idea
how it feels to be abandoned?

06:07.575 --> 06:08.659
Yes, I do.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.038
But this job isn't for me, Lorna.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.664
It's for the boys.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.919
They are craving
stability and electronics.

06:18.669 --> 06:21.506
Just please... help me give that to them.

06:25.802 --> 06:26.761
Well played.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.389
You know they're all I have left.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.141
And I let them down.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.727
What are you talking about?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.149
The night Ted died,

06:41.275 --> 06:42.235
he called me.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.368
Yeah, you've, um... you've mentioned that.

06:50.451 --> 06:53.287
[faint heartbeat]

06:53.371 --> 06:54.997
I can't stop thinking about it.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.628
I didn't answer.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.754
[heartbeat fading]

07:01.838 --> 07:05.508
He didn't leave a message,
but I know he needed me.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.760
A mother knows.

07:08.386 --> 07:10.179
And... I wasn't there.

07:11.722 --> 07:12.682
Where were you?

07:16.644 --> 07:17.854
I may have...

07:19.605 --> 07:21.816
taken a powerful sleeping aid.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.612
Okay. Look, Lorna,
don't beat yourself up about that.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.406
It's not your fault that Ted died.

07:28.489 --> 07:29.824
-Isn't it?
-No.

07:29.907 --> 07:34.328
If a butterfly flaps its wings in Japan,
doesn't it cause a hurricane in Florida?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.747
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.459
I've lost the thread,
but I'm the butterfly.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.710
Okay.

07:42.003 --> 07:42.837
All right.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.217
What's this over here?
Is this a new listing you're working on?

07:49.677 --> 07:52.054
Yes. That's Sapphire Terrace.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.683
I have exclusive pre-sale rights.
Six units, ocean-facing.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.685
Perfect for a rich bachelor.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.854
Mmm. Really?

08:00.897 --> 08:01.856
Know any?

08:03.149 --> 08:03.983
Yeah.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.235
I think I might.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.364
I've just been working here for
three years and I still get the minimum.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.576
You know, when we hired you,
you were like,

08:13.659 --> 08:16.287
"Pay me what you want, Angela.
I just wanna help, Angela."

08:16.370 --> 08:18.331
Just give her a raise.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.208
Abe, I got this, thank you.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.294
It's just that I live with my family now,

08:23.377 --> 08:25.463
and I would really like
to be able to pitch in.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.799
Just give her what she wants,
or I'll go ape-shit.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.301
-Abe!
<i>-</i>What?

08:32.428 --> 08:33.387
I'll talk to management.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.723
Thank you, Angela.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.270
-Hey.
-Judy, I need to talk to you.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.148
There's nothing to talk about,
'cause I'm not pregnant, so don't worry.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.274
It's not that.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.569
A detective came by the gallery today,

08:48.653 --> 08:50.613
started asking me questions
about the Mustang.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.448
-Freaked me out.
-What kind of detective?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.574
I don't know. A black one.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.369
Oh! That's the guy I was dating.
That's Nick. We're fine.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.538
How are we fine?
Why were you dating a black detective?

08:58.621 --> 08:59.455
Don't be racist.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.041
-It's not racist to call him black.
-It is when you say it.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.461
He's actually really sweet. He's trying to
help Jen find the hit-and-run driver.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.129
-You're the fucking driver!
-I know!

09:07.213 --> 09:09.590
But I was getting them
off our scent, okay?

09:09.840 --> 09:11.842
And it was the only thing
that was making Jen happy.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.679
Jesus Christ, Judy.
Why don't you just fucking confess?

09:14.762 --> 09:16.472
-You clearly wanna get caught!
-No, I don't.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.183
She can't find out. I can't lose her
and I can't lose those kids.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.143
-I'm gonna fix it.
-You're gonna fix it?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.520
-Yes.
-'Cause you're a mastermind?

09:22.603 --> 09:23.854
Yes. I'm gonna call Nick.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.815
And say what?
He asked if you own the Mustang.

09:26.482 --> 09:27.817
-He did?
-Yes!

09:27.900 --> 09:30.111
He's on to us
'cause you fucking led him there.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.946
I told you to listen to me
and you couldn't,

09:32.029 --> 09:33.406
could you, fucking bleeding heart.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.616
God damn it.
You have no idea how to work people.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.868
I'm sorry
I'm not as good a criminal as you!

09:37.994 --> 09:40.079
-Hey. Hey!
-Ow!

09:40.162 --> 09:41.289
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.333
You listen to me.
Let me get one thing straight here, okay?

09:44.917 --> 09:47.378
If anybody goes down for this, it is you.
You were driving.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.715
You are the criminal.
I'm the only eyewitness.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.760
-But you said we were in this together.
-Well, now it's every man for himself.

09:54.844 --> 09:55.886
[cell phone buzzes]

09:56.262 --> 09:58.306
And look, it's your friend calling me.

09:58.889 --> 10:00.808
-Why is Jen calling you?
-Jen, what's going on?

10:11.777 --> 10:14.655
You killed that nice lady's husband,
didn't you?

10:21.912 --> 10:22.788
It's okay.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.043
It's okay.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.051
But don't let that asshole
push you around.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.970
I don't know what to do.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.264
What do you wanna do?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.434
I wanna tell the truth.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.936
Well...

10:47.146 --> 10:49.857
they say the truth shall set you free.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
I'm telling you, Judy Hale and Steve Wood

10:55.571 --> 10:57.365
are responsible
for the Harding hit-and-run.

10:57.448 --> 11:00.201
Okay. But do you have any evidence
that isn't entirely circumstantial?

11:00.618 --> 11:05.456
His gallery, TKG Arts,
is the registered owner of a '66 Mustang.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.958
And whose art does he sell? Judy Hale's.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.462
Okay, Mr. Prager, that's interesting, but
I can't arrest people on coincidence.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.256
They were engaged. They were in cahoots.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.092
Cahoots is not
a chargeable offense either.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.762
They broke up a few weeks after the crime.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.390
Guess what could ruin a relationship?
Fucking killing a guy could.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.017
-Right.
-Then she moves in with Jen Harding?

11:25.101 --> 11:26.185
The widow?

11:26.644 --> 11:29.021
They did it. I know it in my bones.

11:29.939 --> 11:30.815
[sighs]

11:30.898 --> 11:34.860
Mr. Prager, you were romantically involved
with Ms. Hale, correct?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.655
-I was, but...
-I'm assuming that didn't work out.

11:38.322 --> 11:39.156
No.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.867
And you were a detective
for the Santa Ana PD, is that right?

11:41.951 --> 11:42.910
-Yes.
-And yet

11:42.993 --> 11:45.204
you haven't reported to work
in three months. Why is that?

11:45.871 --> 11:46.914
Because I took a...

11:47.623 --> 11:50.376
You know, none of this is relevant,
by the way.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.381
-I took a leave of absence.
-Was it voluntary?

11:55.589 --> 11:57.842
-[scoffs] Who cares?
-What was the nature of the leave?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.180
Psychiatric.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.473
Thank you.

12:06.475 --> 12:10.354
Now, I appreciate the tip,
but I have work to do.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.529
Well, thanks for meeting me here.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.823
-Yup. Nice place.
-Yeah.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.159
You know, Jen, when you called,
I got to be honest,

12:23.492 --> 12:24.702
I got a little nervous.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.413
Nervous, huh? Do I make you nervous?

12:27.496 --> 12:30.124
No, no. It's just that everything
that went down with Judy,

12:30.207 --> 12:33.461
and I'm not sure what she told you,
but, you know, I was surprised.

12:33.544 --> 12:34.378
Mm-hm.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.423
-Girl code. I know it's a thing.
-Not really.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.384
I don't wanna talk about Judy right now.
I wanna talk about you.

12:40.801 --> 12:41.969
-Okay.
-And I wanna talk about

12:42.052 --> 12:46.098
what I wanna do for you.
Well, I mean, for us, really.

12:47.558 --> 12:48.934
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:49.769 --> 12:50.603
[exhales]

12:51.437 --> 12:53.063
Wow, Jen, this is, um...

12:54.315 --> 12:58.527
I gotta admit, this is...
I have... I have thought about this.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.570
[chuckles]

12:59.904 --> 13:01.781
You've thought about what?

13:02.323 --> 13:03.532
You know, I've thought about...

13:03.949 --> 13:05.367
No. What?

13:05.951 --> 13:06.952
You know.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.706
-Wait. What were you talking about?
-What are you talking about?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.710
I'm... I'm talking about
selling you a home.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.128
Sapphire Terrace.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.380
Oh. Oh!

13:18.672 --> 13:20.549
What, did you think
I was coming on to you?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.717
No, no, no, no, no.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.260
-'Cause, like, I would never...
-No.

13:23.886 --> 13:25.346
-Ever.
-Right. Obviously.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.265
Yeah. Well, it doesn't seem very obvious.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.811
-No, it was.
-'Cause, I mean, I'm not after you.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.104
Steve, I am after your commission.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.774
Yeah! Honest woman. I love it.
Tell me about the place.

13:37.024 --> 13:40.236
Okay. So, every unit is customizable

13:40.319 --> 13:42.822
and, well, there's this. So...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.158
-[Steve] Pretty hot.
-Fuck, yeah, it is.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.036
The units are selling really fast.
So I would put an offer in today.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.080
[chuckles] Easy, tiger.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.291
You must really need that commission.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.377
I just know a great opportunity
when I see one.

13:57.461 --> 13:59.547
But, yeah, I do. I do need it.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.967
-How big is it?
-Twenty-four hundred square feet.

14:03.050 --> 14:03.884
I mean...

14:03.968 --> 14:05.010
But, hey, you know what?

14:05.094 --> 14:07.012
If you knock down that wall
to the adjoining unit,

14:07.096 --> 14:10.099
you'd get a 48-hundred-square-foot
palace in the sky.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.601
Room for a family.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.145
Yeah.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.402
I'll take them both. All cash.

14:23.654 --> 14:24.864
-All cash?
-Mm-hm.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.742
So... $8.6 million in cash.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.119
Uh... yeah.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.038
Is that enough commission for you?

14:33.706 --> 14:34.540
Yeah.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.584
Good.

14:37.167 --> 14:38.586
Welcome to your new life.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.796
Welcome to yours.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.051
Holy shit.

14:47.636 --> 14:50.014
Oh, shit. Fuckin' A. Fuckin' A. Hell.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.939
Wow. Everyone's coming to
talk to me today. Hmm!

15:00.024 --> 15:01.400
To what do I owe the pleasure?

15:02.192 --> 15:04.862
Hello, Detective. You look well.
Your hair is different.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.488
-No, it's not.
-Oh, okay.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.783
I have something to tell you.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.286
Something that... Do you have any water?

15:12.369 --> 15:15.039
-No.
-Okay, because I'm a little bit nervous.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.918
I have something I've wanted to tell you
for a long time, but I didn't know how.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.963
-I'm listening.
-Yeah.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.132
Maybe like a soda or anything to drink?

15:25.215 --> 15:27.343
-Because my mouth is, like, so dry.
-Ms. Hale.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.221
Have you ever harbored a secret?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.140
It's crippling.

15:34.141 --> 15:36.018
And I think it's taking a toll
on my health,

15:36.268 --> 15:39.104
and is probably the reason
why my womb is prematurely aging.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.899
Do you have, like, a lozenge
in there or anything in your desk?

15:41.982 --> 15:43.484
-I don't.
-Okay.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.527
-Judy.
-Yeah?

15:45.611 --> 15:47.488
[heartbeat]

15:48.906 --> 15:50.282
[Judy breathing shakily]

15:56.038 --> 15:57.665
Steve Wood is a money launderer.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.669
Uh... What? [stutters]

16:02.169 --> 16:04.046
-Come again?
-He's a money launderer.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.255
A big one.

16:05.673 --> 16:08.175
-He's a money launderer?
-Yeah.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.510
And a tax evader.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.346
He has a shell company.
It's called TKG Arts.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.807
It's a gallery, and frankly
some of the stuff is pretty good.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.686
But mostly he uses it to funnel money
for his international clients. Greeks.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.896
[sighs deeply]

16:21.480 --> 16:25.150
That's a pretty big accusation. I assume
you have evidence to support this?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.579
This is where he keeps his paper trail.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.249
That's what it's called, right?
Paper trail?

16:43.335 --> 16:45.045
You have my full cooperation.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.634
[heavy metal music playing]

16:57.266 --> 16:58.684
Hello, everybody.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.769
Mommy's got presents.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.231
Mommy should probably stop calling herself
Mommy, but Mommy like it.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.191
Hello.

17:06.734 --> 17:07.568
Oh.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.528
Hey, Lorna. So you got my message.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.739
He bought two.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.365
All cash.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.744
Paperwork's being prepped.
He's wiring the deposit tomorrow.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.996
So, you're welcome.

17:19.079 --> 17:22.124
That's not what... Charlie called me.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.294
Okay. If this is about the laptop,
Mommy took care of it.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.796
Jennifer, I want you to know
this is not my doing.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.214
What's not your doing?

17:29.840 --> 17:30.674
Oh...

17:32.134 --> 17:33.260
I'm moving out.

17:33.802 --> 17:34.887
I'm gonna live with Grandma.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.805
-What?
-He wants to live with me.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.723
I heard him.

17:39.767 --> 17:44.104
Char, I know we had a little fight
this morning, but, come on, a laptop--

17:44.188 --> 17:46.106
It's not just about the laptop.

17:48.358 --> 17:51.361
Look, Charlie, I know that things
have been hard since your dad died,

17:51.445 --> 17:54.990
but I promise you,
they are gonna get so much better.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.701
-I can't live with you anymore.
-Why?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.913
-What did I do?
-You know what you did...

18:02.581 --> 18:03.749
the night Dad died.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.253
Good. Fucking go!

18:08.337 --> 18:10.714
I never wanna see your fucking face again!

18:16.553 --> 18:17.679
We had a fight.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.600
Charlie, people do that in marriages.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.520
He didn't wanna live with you anymore.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.564
And neither do I.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.369
[door closes]

18:41.912 --> 18:42.746
Sorry.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.249
Did you say all cash?

19:06.854 --> 19:08.480
-[Jen] Hey.
-[gasps] Hey.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.774
Jeez, you scared the shit out of me!

19:11.775 --> 19:13.527
What are you doing
sitting there in the dark?

19:15.445 --> 19:17.030
Do you want me to get that Cabernet?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.784
Or... something stronger?

19:24.746 --> 19:25.747
Where are the boys?

19:26.748 --> 19:27.583
They asleep?

19:28.709 --> 19:29.793
They're at Lorna's.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.213
Everything okay?

19:35.674 --> 19:36.550
What's going on?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.888
It's my fault.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.641
What's your fault?

19:47.644 --> 19:48.645
That he's gone.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.608
Wait. Do you mean Charlie or Henry?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.154
-Ted.
-Ted?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.408
What are you talking about?

20:06.288 --> 20:07.664
The night that he died...

20:09.124 --> 20:10.083
we had a fight.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.171
Well, okay. People fight.
That doesn't make it your fault.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.797
No. No, I...

20:18.133 --> 20:19.676
I was really angry.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.805
What were you fighting about?

20:27.976 --> 20:29.603
It's too hard to talk about it.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.688
You can tell me.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.524
Come on. You can tell me anything.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.740
He hadn't...

20:42.491 --> 20:45.619
He hadn't touched me in over a year.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.997
Okay. Well, he was having an affair.
So that is on him.

20:49.081 --> 20:49.915
No.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.087
No. He... he stopped after...

20:55.796 --> 20:57.089
after my, um...

20:58.048 --> 20:59.132
mastectomy.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.176
Oh.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.139
I just thought it wouldn't matter.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.518
That he... he...

21:11.353 --> 21:12.646
he could get past...

21:14.731 --> 21:16.733
all of that. But he couldn't.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.154
-I'm so sorry.
-And he didn't want me anymore.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.992
But I needed him.

21:26.743 --> 21:27.619
He...

21:28.120 --> 21:29.162
He made...

21:30.289 --> 21:33.000
He made me feel so disgusting.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.628
And I... [sniffs]

21:36.712 --> 21:39.506
was just so resentful.

21:42.259 --> 21:43.176
And...

21:44.303 --> 21:46.847
that night, it just got heated and...

21:49.266 --> 21:50.392
and I hit him.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.772
The last thing I did before
he walked out that door was...

21:56.606 --> 21:57.691
was hit him.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.485
Okay.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.030
I punched him in the face.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.532
Well, I'm sure he said something
that made you--

22:05.615 --> 22:07.242
Oh, God. Judy, please stop.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.162
Stop trying to make me feel better
all the time.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.414
I'm just saying.
I'm sure there was a good--

22:12.497 --> 22:14.708
No! It is my fault that he's dead.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.127
He wasn't even here.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.256
-He was out on a run, Jen.
-Oh, God. He wasn't running.

22:23.091 --> 22:26.636
It was one o'clock in the morning.
He was on that road

22:26.845 --> 22:31.058
because he didn't wanna spend
another second in this house with me.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.394
I killed him.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.025
Oh, God. I keep trying to find... [sniffs]

22:40.108 --> 22:42.694
the person to blame and...

22:43.904 --> 22:44.988
I drove him away.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.324
I hit him.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.160
I fucking hit him.

22:52.537 --> 22:53.830
[Jen sighs]

22:58.251 --> 22:59.211
No. I hit him.

22:59.586 --> 23:00.420
What?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.298
-I hit him.
-Okay.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.008
What are you talk...

23:06.510 --> 23:07.511
I hit him.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.887
No. I hit him.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.764
-No. I hit him.
-I hit him.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.517
-I hit him. Judy. Oh, God.
-I hit him.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.936
-He was walking out the door and--
-I had a '66 Mustang.

23:28.782 --> 23:29.866
It was so dark,

23:30.617 --> 23:34.204
and I was driving,
and I didn't see a bend

23:34.830 --> 23:37.707
in the road,
and I took it too fast, and I...

23:43.004 --> 23:44.256
He was just right there.

23:46.299 --> 23:49.386
I wasn't even sure what had happened.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.180
And then I wanted to go back...

23:55.016 --> 23:56.101
but I couldn't.

23:59.980 --> 24:00.981
[Judy sniffs]

24:01.690 --> 24:06.194
And I thought if I could just...
somehow make it up to you,

24:07.404 --> 24:08.405
if I could...

24:09.489 --> 24:13.577
help you somehow,
or if I could be your friend...

24:23.378 --> 24:25.297
Please forgive me, Jen.

24:26.965 --> 24:27.883
Please.

24:29.801 --> 24:34.014
I had no idea that I was gonna
love you so much,

24:34.890 --> 24:37.976
or the boys, or that you guys
would become my family.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.732
Please...

24:45.400 --> 24:46.526
say something.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.283
Please tell me what I can do
to make it better

24:53.867 --> 24:56.411
and to make things right,
and I'll do it. I would do anything.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.790
Please tell me what I can do.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.002
[Judy sobs]

25:09.257 --> 25:10.300
You can die.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.854
[Judy] No. No.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.750
Abe, you up?

25:46.920 --> 25:47.921
[Angela sighs]
