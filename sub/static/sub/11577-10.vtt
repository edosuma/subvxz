00:06.132 --> 00:07.497
[BO narrating]
Last time on Lost Girl:

00:07.717 --> 00:08.923
[ZEE] Bo released
Hades from Tartarus.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.295
[MAN] I'm a doctor,
what happened?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.341
[DYSON]
Didn't catch your name.

00:11.554 --> 00:12.179
It's Hades.

00:12.388 --> 00:13.047
Hi Bo.

00:13.264 --> 00:14.094
[IRIS] |s Mark here?

00:14.307 --> 00:15.387
--[TR|CK] The Nyx.
--[CHR|STOS] It can't be...

00:15.600 --> 00:16.635
[LAUREN]
Did Iris do this to you?

00:16.851 --> 00:17.840
Not Iris, Nyx.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.095
[BO] Help me get rid of Nyx.

00:19.312 --> 00:20.347
[HADES] If you want to
get rid of Nyx,

00:20.563 --> 00:21.552
Iris will have to die.

00:21.772 --> 00:22.636
I won't kill lris.

00:22.857 --> 00:23.687
I carry Darkness.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.606
I am Darkness.

00:25.818 --> 00:26.978
--[|R|S gasping]
--[HADES] Yes.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.605
It's a good thing that
we got back together

00:28.821 --> 00:30.231
just in time for
the end of the world.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.563
At least we
got back together.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.943
[car horn honks]

00:38.122 --> 00:38.986
[BO] Something moved.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.413
Just like when
"something moved"

00:40.625 --> 00:42.661
the last five times
we checked Zee's condo?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.413
Are you saying
I'm off my game?

00:44.629 --> 00:45.209
Zee's missing.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.082
Lauren almost dying.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.003
Your father...

00:48.216 --> 00:49.422
It's a lot.

00:49.634 --> 00:53.172
Even if he is my father,
I summoned the devil, Dyson.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.298
And we will find a way
to get rid of him.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.379
What if he hurts someone?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.465
[DYSON] He's contained.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.221
So was Hannibal Lecter.

01:01.437 --> 01:03.052
Didn't last.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.182
New nickname?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.729
[BO] Add it to the pile:

01:05.942 --> 01:08.729
Hades. Jack. BF.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.025
Best friend?

01:10.238 --> 01:11.023
Birth father.

01:11.239 --> 01:13.104
Oh, and Lauren's lab rat.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.656
[phone ringing]

01:15.868 --> 01:18.701
Speak of the devil's keeper.

01:18.913 --> 01:21.996
Hey, it's the girl who
likes to play in traffic.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.288
Yeah. about that--

01:23.501 --> 01:25.742
Lauren, you don't
have to thank me.

01:25.962 --> 01:26.917
How's my BF?

01:27.129 --> 01:27.879
Your best friend?

01:28.089 --> 01:28.794
Birth father.

01:29.006 --> 01:29.961
[chuckles]

01:30.174 --> 01:32.711
[LAUREN] Still here.
Locked up. Polite.

01:32.927 --> 01:34.087
Listen, about that chi suck.

01:34.303 --> 01:37.090
Didn't you think
it felt... weird?

01:37.306 --> 01:39.638
Yeah, but what
doesn't right now?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.556
I wasn't in control of it,
but it worked.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.758
That's all that matters.

01:42.979 --> 01:45.595
[BO] It's the perks to having
a succubus girlfriend.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.806
I'm on a stakeout,
I'll call you later.

01:48.693 --> 01:49.432
[phone beeps]

01:49.652 --> 01:50.812
Yeah.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.861
Except I think it was
me being the succubus.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.656
[DYSON] The last time
you breathed life

01:57.868 --> 01:59.028
back into someone...

01:59.245 --> 02:01.827
Was you.
At my dawning.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.030
Didn't you need to do
a group suck to do that?

02:04.250 --> 02:06.081
Who doesn't love
a good group suck?

02:06.294 --> 02:08.285
To bring me back
you needed

02:08.504 --> 02:10.210
to suck chi from
multiple sources.

02:10.423 --> 02:11.879
Do you think the
proximity of my father

02:12.091 --> 02:13.547
is making me stronger?

02:13.759 --> 02:15.090
Or maybe your
love of Lauren.

02:15.303 --> 02:17.385
What if I could
do this all along?

02:18.681 --> 02:19.966
What if I could
have saved Hale?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.843
Don't do that
to yourself, Bo.

02:22.059 --> 02:22.889
[sighs]

02:23.102 --> 02:24.262
[DYSON] If you could have,
you would have.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.979
You know that.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.647
[HADES] It could have been
temporary transference,

02:29.859 --> 02:31.850
i.e. Bo subconsciously
gave you the power

02:32.069 --> 02:33.775
to heal yourself.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.524
Or...

02:35.740 --> 02:39.198
Did you apply the
benign virus we discussed?

02:39.410 --> 02:41.492
[HADES] I couldn't
help but overhear.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.444
Hope you don't mind.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.700
| mind.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.578
I very mind.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.455
[HADES] I'm very sorry.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.627
It just appears...

02:52.840 --> 02:56.332
that you're in need
of some guidance.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.883
[HADES] If you
let me examine you...

02:58.095 --> 03:00.472
[chuckles]

03:00.681 --> 03:03.263
[LAUREN] No. Thanks.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.352
One of the perks of
being out on a stakeout.

03:14.028 --> 03:14.938
Salty snacks.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.110
Since when
do you pack snacks?

03:17.323 --> 03:18.358
Alicia I guess.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.862
Oh! Alicia.

03:22.078 --> 03:24.660
She teaching a Zumba
class out of your gym?

03:24.872 --> 03:27.784
I'm keeping her close
until I find a way to...

03:28.000 --> 03:30.616
clear her memory
of all things Fae.

03:30.836 --> 03:31.700
How close?

03:31.921 --> 03:33.206
Men in Black,
"look-into-the-device" close?

03:33.422 --> 03:36.209
Or "I like the freckles
on your nose" close?

03:36.425 --> 03:38.666
She's been exposed
to enough that

03:38.886 --> 03:42.754
could endanger
the colony. And herself.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.431
Her husband's in a coma.
She's... human.

03:46.644 --> 03:47.679
lt's complicated.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.183
Yeah, tell me about it.

03:51.399 --> 03:55.483
Sometimes the worst feeling
is not knowing how to feel.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.731
Long, black, and pulling in
at twelve o'clock.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.734
That has gotta be Zee.

04:10.126 --> 04:11.161
Kenzi?

04:16.799 --> 04:21.793
[opening theme]

04:23.806 --> 04:25.137
[KENZI] Sheers.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.965
I mean... sheers?!

04:28.185 --> 04:31.222
Guys, I've been gone
for five minutes and

04:31.439 --> 04:32.679
Dyson turned daddy,

04:32.898 --> 04:35.605
Bo's Daddy got the
welcome Magneto cell,

04:35.818 --> 04:37.183
[KENZI] and Dyson
has a hunky, yummy,

04:37.403 --> 04:38.984
hold-no-pecs son?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.527
You said that already.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.400
It bears repeating.

04:45.578 --> 04:46.533
Hola.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.201
Hola yourself.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.530
[DYSON] Uh, no.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.206
Ya'll have been busier
than Bo's tinkleflower, huh?

04:53.419 --> 04:55.751
[KENZI]
And you're fighting gods?

04:55.963 --> 04:58.579
Climbing the
evil ladder, | see.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.630
Not gods. Fae.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.174
A long time ago
they were seen as gods.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.172
--[BO] And they're back.
--[KENZ|] Got it: gods.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.674
Your pops is one
of them. Freakin' Hades.

05:06.891 --> 05:09.633
What does that
make you? I mean...

05:09.852 --> 05:11.217
For real, are you okay?

05:11.437 --> 05:14.099
Once I know you are,
I'll be better.

05:14.315 --> 05:15.976
What were you
doing at the condo?

05:16.192 --> 05:18.899
Well look who's all business
up in my business.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.817
Kenzi, you pulled up
in a limo.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.816
[B0] The only thing missing
was the paparazzi.

05:23.032 --> 05:24.818
Santiago money stretches far.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.195
As in stretch limo
airport pickups far.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.575
[KENZI] I know, tacky--
But oh god, I love it.

05:31.790 --> 05:32.745
I came here first.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.744
When you guys weren't here,
| tracked you down.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.621
Well welcome back.

05:39.465 --> 05:40.329
Something happened in Spain.

05:40.549 --> 05:41.834
I needed to see you.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.461
Why?

05:44.595 --> 05:46.335
To warn you.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.967
There's someone
I want you to meet.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.343
[MAN] I returned to
Cadaqués one night,

05:50.559 --> 05:51.674
and I could see
the lights weren't on.

05:51.894 --> 05:52.679
In my castillo.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.635
That's not like my Kenzi,
I said to myself,

05:54.855 --> 05:55.935
and l was right.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.264
I found my poor girl
tied to a chair--

05:58.484 --> 06:00.520
Seconds from untying myself,
before he walked in.

06:00.736 --> 06:01.942
They only roughed
me up a bit but

06:02.154 --> 06:03.894
they searched my
castillo for hours.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.240
That's her word
of the week.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.814
It means castle.

06:07.034 --> 06:07.898
Got it.

06:08.118 --> 06:08.948
What were they after?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.150
[MAN] A painting I gave
to my grandson,

06:10.371 --> 06:11.577
nearly two hundred
years ago.

06:11.789 --> 06:13.029
lt's known as The Vanishing.

06:13.249 --> 06:14.204
Appropriate.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.452
Uh yeah, because it's
rarely ever been seen.

06:16.669 --> 06:17.875
It's never been on display.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.703
That painting was an urban
legend at valkyrie school.

06:20.923 --> 06:21.833
It's real, though,

06:22.049 --> 06:24.335
and as dangerous as
art gets, apparently.

06:24.552 --> 06:27.009
No one knows how the Ancients
disappeared from Earth.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.712
[MAN] I was told that
my painting holds the key.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.843
Find your grandson,
find the painting?

06:32.059 --> 06:34.550
Sadly, that's an
impossibility, cariﬁa.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.310
Heathcliff Santiago.

06:40.526 --> 06:41.766
Hale's grandfather...

06:43.904 --> 06:45.189
[BO] Oh Kenz.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.442
Kenzi tells me stories
of the man I hardly knew.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.865
And Heath walks me
through Hale's childhood.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.362
Nothing but trouble that one.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.490
But what would these people
want with Hale's painting?

06:53.706 --> 06:54.786
[KENZI] Nothing good.
And they mentioned

06:54.999 --> 06:57.035
a succubus who
slayed the Una Mens.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.207
And really, how many
of those are there?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.205
I'm gonna say
less than fifty.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.285
So I was thinking that--

07:01.505 --> 07:03.245
--[BO] We find it first.
--[KENZ|] Bingo.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.090
Or as they say
in Spain...

07:04.300 --> 07:05.005
[HEATH and KENZI] Bingo.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.332
And if Zee's the one
who sent people in

07:06.552 --> 07:08.838
after the painting,
then legend must be true.

07:09.054 --> 07:09.713
[BO] Where is it now?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.170
Well when Hale had a
falling out with his fam,

07:11.390 --> 07:12.470
he donated their collection.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.719
You know, trappings of
wealth, that sorta thing.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.220
I'm guessing charity auction?

07:16.437 --> 07:17.142
I'm on it.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.389
[BO] Then we can
use it to send Zee

07:18.606 --> 07:19.721
back to where she came from

07:19.940 --> 07:21.146
before she tries
to end the world.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.734
--[TAMS|N] Again.
--[BO] Right.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.355
So, which love triangle
candidate are

07:25.571 --> 07:26.731
we calling up on these days?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.654
D-man? L-bomb?

07:29.867 --> 07:32.153
You look good.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.782
Um, did something?
Did you two?

07:35.998 --> 07:38.614
We have a lot
to catch up on.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.543
[VEX] Cramping, aching,
pins and needles.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.668
I can barely yank my own junk,
let alone anyone else's.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.545
[VEX] What am I gonna do?

07:48.761 --> 07:50.422
--[LAUREN] Meth.
--[VEX] Have you gone mad?

07:50.638 --> 07:54.677
Movement, elevation,
traction, heat.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.474
M.E.T.H. It was part of
your physiotherapy, Vex.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.345
I wrote it down.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.553
Eh, so many stickies,
so little time.

08:00.773 --> 08:03.856
Y'know I do have actual
real patients to see.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.480
Come on, gimme a quickie.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.195
Okay. [sighs]

08:11.367 --> 08:15.701
[moans]

08:16.997 --> 08:19.989
[VEX] Oh, no, yeah,
that's the ticket.

08:20.209 --> 08:22.495
Ah, keep it going.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.971
No. Way.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.845
Oh, yes way.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.723
But can we ramp up the
pressure to maybe a seven?

08:41.939 --> 08:44.806
Uh. No way that l
have time for this, Vex.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.640
[LAUREN]
See? Real patients.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.610
Ay, wait, wait, wait.

08:47.820 --> 08:48.684
Speaking of real patients.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.019
H-How's Mark?

08:50.239 --> 08:52.480
Fully recovered.
You just missed him.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.940
[LAUREN]
Remember, M.E.T.H.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.148
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.452
Movement, evacuation,
titties, head.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.126
First a succubus...

09:06.338 --> 09:08.329
DOW a mesmer...

09:09.633 --> 09:11.339
I know what you are.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.883
[DYSON] Detective.

09:13.095 --> 09:15.928
Lives in a boxing gym.
All-around ordinary guy?

09:16.140 --> 09:17.971
More like
an all-around liar.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.011
These are confidential.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.606
Seems to be that Kevin,
here in quotations,

09:27.818 --> 09:30.434
is now a vessel or a host
to someone called Hera,

09:30.654 --> 09:34.738
who may actually be
the Greek goddess.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.157
You're right,
totally ordinary.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.233
Let me explain.

09:38.454 --> 09:39.614
[ALICIA] Explain to me
how the date of the file

09:39.830 --> 09:40.910
was from before we met.

09:41.123 --> 09:41.703
You knew who I was

09:41.915 --> 09:43.291
when I came to you
for help, didn't you?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.536
[ALICIA] Ever since
Kevin tried to kill me.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.084
I've been doing research.

09:47.296 --> 09:48.832
I know what you are.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.957
You're a believer
in the paranormal.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.760
Yes. That's what I am.
You're right.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.430
I knew it.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.261
Why didn't you tell me?

10:09.860 --> 10:12.351
Because this kind of stuff
has to be kept secret.

10:12.571 --> 10:14.311
I mean, could you imagine if

10:14.531 --> 10:16.522
someone on the
police force found out?

10:16.742 --> 10:19.779
Of course. I mean,
I wouldn't dream--

10:20.412 --> 10:21.743
If it's all right
with you, I'm gonna do

10:21.955 --> 10:23.331
some more research
on possession

10:23.540 --> 10:24.950
from the books you have
scattered around.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.374
You know I think I, umm--

10:28.670 --> 10:30.535
[DYSON] I'd prefer if
you didn't do it alone.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.587
Mark can help you.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.835
Help with what?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.258
Alicia's looking
into possession.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.426
She knows what we believe.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.504
She found our files.

10:40.724 --> 10:41.634
She found our files?

10:41.850 --> 10:46.014
Yes, our paranormal
investigation files.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.515
Something's
possessed my husband

10:47.731 --> 10:50.017
and I need to
find out what.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.223
Oh. Right.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.819
Yes, um, those files.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.063
Yeah, could be
a number of things.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.735
[ALICIA]
Okay, so what do we have?

10:55.948 --> 10:58.564
Nymphs, sirens,
we rewolves--

10:58.784 --> 11:02.493
They don't like
to be called that.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.535
Or so I've heard.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.158
Look, I'll see
you guys later.

11:07.918 --> 11:08.873
Watch what you say.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.496
Yeah.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.252
[KENZI] So Dad.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.841
I need deets.
I need Dad deets.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.665
There's not much to tell.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.546
[30}
He's here. He's bad.

11:18.762 --> 11:19.877
And he needs to go.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.633
You need to tell me
about Spain.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.555
[KENZI] Oh, it's whatevs.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.052
Truth?

11:25.269 --> 11:26.554
It's incredible,
it's beautiful,

11:26.770 --> 11:28.055
--[KENZI] it's life-changing.
--[BO] Mm.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.558
I realized I don't need
all the bells and whistles.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.560
Because you are
the bells and whistles.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.891
Boom baby, there it is.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.727
[BO] And a shadow thief.

11:36.947 --> 11:37.732
Well, I pride myself.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.279
But you know,
the security here--

11:39.491 --> 11:41.573
[KENZI] That painting's going
to be muy dificil to lift.

11:41.785 --> 11:43.867
[BO] We haven't
even seen it yet.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.865
I wonder if Tamsin
got the wrong gallery?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.867
[KENZI] Or maybe they're just
keeping it out of sight.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.118
Or what if Zee
already got to it?

11:49.334 --> 11:52.918
Well if she has, I smell
another end of days coming.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.961
Huh.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.880
Tours every hour on the hour.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.458
All we need
is an inside man.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.293
Or an inside Kenzi.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.628
That came out wrong.

12:02.848 --> 12:03.633
What do you
know about art?

12:03.849 --> 12:04.759
Only everything.

12:04.975 --> 12:05.600
I mean there's Banksy...

12:05.809 --> 12:08.721
And, also, Banksy.

12:08.937 --> 12:09.972
[chuckles]

12:10.188 --> 12:12.099
Girl, five minutes home and
we're already undercover.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.477
It's our bells
and whistles, baby.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.149
Bells and whistles.

12:20.616 --> 12:23.574
You're not happy with
our current collections?

12:23.785 --> 12:25.241
[BO]
Well quite frankly, Suri--

12:25.454 --> 12:26.739
may I call you Suri?

12:26.955 --> 12:29.492
|-| feel like they're
a little from the period of

12:29.708 --> 12:31.573
been there done that.
[chuckles]

12:31.793 --> 12:37.459
I'm looking for a
very special piece.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.584
They call it--

12:38.800 --> 12:39.835
Please don't!

12:49.227 --> 12:51.354
I just need, um--

12:51.563 --> 12:52.552
Is that a loose thread?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.684
[gaSPSI

12:58.570 --> 13:01.858
These are all our
undisplayed works.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.910
[sighs]

13:09.957 --> 13:14.166
No, no, no.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.835
Hey, I'm going to
throw a name out at you:

13:17.047 --> 13:18.628
the Santiago collection.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.831
Ring-a-ding-ding?

13:21.051 --> 13:22.507
The Santiago acquisition?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.050
[laughs]

13:24.262 --> 13:25.718
That one is reserved.

13:25.931 --> 13:26.886
For who?

13:27.099 --> 13:28.680
For whom.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.140
For whom?

13:31.353 --> 13:32.809
I'm sorry.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.932
I don't think we have
anything for you.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.888
Y'know the last time
someone did that

13:37.109 --> 13:39.691
to a potential buyer,
they regretted it.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.145
Big mistake. Big. Huge.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.571
Can I at least see it?

13:44.783 --> 13:47.240
We only open the
vault to serious bids.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.783
And I have one
coming in tomorrow.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.078
[SURI]
Mm. Let me see you out.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.658
[BO] No. That won't
be necessary--

13:55.877 --> 13:56.866
[sneezes]

13:58.422 --> 14:02.415
[BO] Sorry. Allergies.
Such a bitch.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.421
Kenzi.
The painting's here.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.052
We need to move. Fast.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.683
[KENZI] We are walking,
yes we are.

14:16.898 --> 14:22.234
We are walking, we're doing
a little side-step and twirl.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.858
All right, not the
twirling type, I understand.

14:25.073 --> 14:28.065
Um, clearly what
we have here

14:28.285 --> 14:30.196
is the Swedish flag.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.743
[WOMAN] I beg to differ.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.822
No cross, no blue
divided into quarters.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.533
Well exactly,
the intention of the famed,

14:37.753 --> 14:39.459
underground Swedish painter,

14:39.671 --> 14:42.834
Svea Svenssonsson,
who depicts here

14:43.050 --> 14:45.382
a country divided.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.960
By what?

14:48.180 --> 14:49.716
Music.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.422
[KENZI] For this is a
country reigned by the...

14:52.642 --> 14:54.018
the sequin
encrusted jumpsuits

14:54.227 --> 14:55.888
and catchy disco
tunes of ABBA.

14:56.104 --> 15:00.347
Or, is it a reign
of--of terror.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.182
This is a joke.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.312
[KENZI] Excuse me?

15:03.528 --> 15:05.359
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.688
[laughs]
Don't I though?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.944
Because within the line
dividing the painting

15:10.160 --> 15:12.947
are the lyrics
to "Chiquitita."

15:13.163 --> 15:14.619
I don't see anything.

15:14.831 --> 15:18.665
Take a chance on me, friend.
Look a little closer.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.501
Go ahead. Come on.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.544
[KENZI]
It's right over--

15:23.757 --> 15:24.507

15:24.716 --> 15:26.547
Miss, step away
from the painting.

Are you kidding me?

15:27.969 --> 15:28.958

[MARK] Hey, hey. All right.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.143
Don't be wrecking any
of the books, all right?

15:46.363 --> 15:47.443
Trick's gonna lose his shit.

15:47.656 --> 15:48.611
Who's Trick?

15:48.824 --> 15:49.734
[MARK]
Old guy. Owns the bar.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.736
He's really into
all this stuff.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.030
[ALICIA]
I remember that girl.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.362
Dyson said she was sick.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.833
She was possessed too,
wasn't she?

16:01.128 --> 16:02.368
Yeah, you could say that.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.704
[ALICIA] You must have a theory
on what happened to Kevin.

16:05.924 --> 16:07.755
Why target him?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.083
[sighs]

16:09.302 --> 16:11.293
I don't know.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.054
[ALICIA] Oh my god.

16:17.185 --> 16:20.973
He--He was possessed
and I stabbed him.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.020
Alicia, it's not your fault.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.268
[ALICIA] I-I should've
taken him somewhere.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.099
I should've...
taken him to a--

16:26.319 --> 16:28.401
a priest or--
or something. I--

16:28.613 --> 16:29.022
You didn't know--

16:29.239 --> 16:31.025
I should've done something.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.027
He was my husband
and he was right here!

16:33.243 --> 16:35.154
He was an Ancient.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.450
What are you--
What? What?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.244
What do you mean?
What's an "Ancient"?

16:38.456 --> 16:41.493
It means there's nothing
you could have done.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.666
A Fae like that...

16:43.879 --> 16:45.494

16:48.800 --> 16:52.418

kinda my thang.

after the painting,

17:58.578 --> 18:00.569
I can't put you at risk.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.950
[KENZI] Well all right.
While you go all nineties,

18:03.166 --> 18:06.033
I'll just be here
with a stick of Big Red.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.290
So we can heist

Catherine Zeta-Jones?

20:50.333 --> 20:52.665
I'm bound to Hades.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.663
My father.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.964
So, you two are Bonnie
and Clyding it, huh?

21:00.176 --> 21:03.259
Tell me, do you two prefer
Persades or Herdephone?

21:03.471 --> 21:05.336
When he was released,
so was I.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.138
With a promise.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.057
I find this painting
and bring it to him.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.726
Wherever he is.

21:11.938 --> 21:13.849
Locked up tight.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.269
[BO] He's my prisoner now.

21:17.485 --> 21:23.105
According to lore,
this makes me your prisoner.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.415
I don't roll
like that, Perseph.

21:31.624 --> 21:35.663
You mean I can just...
walk out?

21:35.879 --> 21:38.461
I believe you can fly.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.710
Thank you.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.896
[BO] Wait.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.311
Before you go,

21:55.523 --> 21:58.481
[BO] tell me anything you
can about this painting.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.651
I've heard it contains
"The First Song."

22:01.863 --> 22:04.980
Your father might know more.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.107
[LAUREN] I need answers.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.863
The TTV virus.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.113
Your Trojan horse worked.

22:10.330 --> 22:10.864
Yeah. I got that part.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.365
The problem is,
I thought I was

22:12.582 --> 22:14.197
extending my life span
to Fae years.

22:14.417 --> 22:15.452
And instead,
I've turned myself into

22:15.668 --> 22:17.283
something
I didn't quite expect.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.541
Spoken like a true scientist
with no guinea pig.

22:20.757 --> 22:23.123
I injected myself.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.174
I got hit by a truck.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.887
Bo held me,
I sucked her chi,

22:27.096 --> 22:29.428
and I survived.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.886
Hm.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.056
I'm a conduit.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.438
You're taking on the Fae
powers of those you touch.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.861
Dr. Lewis.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.280
You have found the key
to ultimate power.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.732
That could be very bad.

22:48.952 --> 22:49.907
Or very good.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.495
Yeah, but I don't know
how it affects those Faes

22:51.704 --> 22:53.490
whose powers I'm taking on.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.242
But you like it?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.538
I can do anything.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.116
[HADES] Yeah.

22:58.336 --> 22:59.792
But there are
still unknowns.

23:00.004 --> 23:00.993
How long will it last?

23:01.214 --> 23:03.250
What are the side effects?
What are the dangers?

23:03.466 --> 23:07.755
Like all power, it needs
to be under control.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.507
I need to work on that.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.883
You don't think
you deserve to be Fae.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.183
[HADES] Being born Fae
doesn't make you special.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.226
It makes you different.

23:17.438 --> 23:19.178
And you as human,

23:19.399 --> 23:21.105
if you found a way
to actually turn Fae,

23:21.317 --> 23:23.729
oh Lauren... my gods,

23:23.945 --> 23:27.187
you'd be more than
all of us put together.

23:27.407 --> 23:30.615
And just imagine
how thrilled Bo will be.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.411
I've been calling for an hour.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.583
[DYSON]
Why didn't you pick up?

23:44.549 --> 23:46.380
[ALICIA grunts]

23:46.593 --> 23:50.085
[ALICIA]
Fae? Shapeshifter?

23:50.305 --> 23:52.512
What did you say to her?

23:52.724 --> 23:53.713
[ALICIA] How could
you keep this from me?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.764
I had to keep you safe.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.433
You saw what happened
to your husband.

23:57.645 --> 23:59.306
You had to
keep yourself safe!

23:59.522 --> 24:00.557
Your secrets.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.274
And I don't have
the right to do that?

24:02.483 --> 24:03.438
Where is he?

24:03.651 --> 24:05.767
Where are you keeping Kevin?

24:05.987 --> 24:07.352
I had to.

24:07.572 --> 24:08.436
I'm not leaving until I--

24:08.656 --> 24:10.396
Until what?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.323
Until I tell you
the whole ugly truth

24:12.535 --> 24:14.446
about the "creatures"
who ruined your life?

24:14.662 --> 24:15.447
[MARK]
What are you doing?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.164
Fixing your mistake.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.159
[MARK] You think you know
what she can handle?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.536
You think you know her
better than she does?

24:21.753 --> 24:24.836
You have no idea
what I know.

24:25.048 --> 24:28.131
Iris is dead.

24:28.343 --> 24:29.924
She's dead and
I can barely stand it.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.376
She's lost
the man she loves.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.508
I mean please,
please tell me you get that.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.514
Come.

24:40.730 --> 24:42.391
[ALICIA] Where?

24:44.359 --> 24:45.895
I'll show you.

24:48.571 --> 24:49.526
[ALICIA] Kevin.

24:49.739 --> 24:53.152
[machines beeping]

24:53.368 --> 24:54.983
What are you doing to him?

24:55.203 --> 24:56.488
Waiting.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.911
Kevin is still
alive in there.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.455
Just buried deep.

25:01.668 --> 25:05.252
And this "Hera,"
is he still in there too?

25:05.463 --> 25:07.795
We won't know
until he wakes up.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.122
Can I touch him?

25:09.342 --> 25:10.878
Of course.

25:22.522 --> 25:25.605
I don't know
how to feel.

25:25.817 --> 25:28.524
How could you?

25:28.736 --> 25:30.852
Just don't lose hope.

25:33.241 --> 25:35.857
[sniffs]
Have you lost someone?

25:36.077 --> 25:39.114
In a way, yes.

25:39.330 --> 25:43.494
How long did it
take you to get over it?

25:43.710 --> 25:46.577
I'll let you know when I do.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.835
I have to go.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.587
Please don't follow me.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.504
[TRICK] Incredible.
A depiction of the last time

25:58.725 --> 26:00.511
the Ancients
were seen on Earth.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.637
Before they vanished.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.389
If Zeus and Hades
are mortal enemies,

26:03.604 --> 26:05.140
they probably want
to banish each other

26:05.356 --> 26:07.597
using this painting.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.933
Guys...

26:10.153 --> 26:10.983
we have the painting.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.184
Honey, that could
be your mantra,

26:12.405 --> 26:13.861
but we still
need clarification.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.780
We have the power to
banish both Jack and Zee.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.324
Wait up, who's--
who's Jack?

26:18.536 --> 26:20.527
My father.
We're calling him Jack.

26:20.747 --> 26:21.452
'Kay.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.449
[TRICK]
We may have the painting,

26:22.665 --> 26:24.201
but we don't know
how it works.

26:24.417 --> 26:27.909
Persephone said it is
the key to "The First Song."

26:28.129 --> 26:30.586
The Odyssey speaks of
a melody so seductive

26:30.798 --> 26:32.789
that the ships were carried
to their own demise.

26:33.009 --> 26:34.670
Seductive enough
for the Ancients?

26:34.886 --> 26:36.842
Perhaps.
With the right notes...

26:37.054 --> 26:38.885
[TRICK] "Whoever
encounters them unawares

26:39.098 --> 26:40.679
and listens to their voices

26:40.892 --> 26:43.634
will never joy
at reaching home."

26:43.853 --> 26:45.718
Okay so where's
the "play" button?

26:45.938 --> 26:48.395
The music must
reveal itself to the ones

26:48.608 --> 26:51.645
who know the
painting's true purpose.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.271
Licorice.

26:53.488 --> 26:54.898
Okay.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.867
Voila!

27:02.079 --> 27:02.989
Where'd that come from?

27:03.206 --> 27:05.663
Your candy jar is
being put to good use.

27:05.875 --> 27:06.955
Finally. Usually
it's your candy jar

27:07.168 --> 27:07.953
to the rescue.

27:08.169 --> 27:09.830
Uh, can we please,
for once,

27:10.046 --> 27:11.707
not talk about my
granddaughter's "candy"

27:11.923 --> 27:12.708
in front of me?!

27:12.924 --> 27:13.504
--[KENZI] Ewww.
--[BO] Trick!

27:13.716 --> 27:15.832
Oh now I'm
crossing the line?

27:23.893 --> 27:25.679
Wait for it.

27:28.856 --> 27:31.063
[BO] There. "The First Song."

27:31.275 --> 27:35.609
[humming]

27:35.822 --> 27:37.358
Nate taught me
how to read music.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.905
Thanks to Kenzi,
we have our singer.

27:40.117 --> 27:41.573
Oh honey, Spain is
a magical place.

27:41.786 --> 27:42.821
But sadly
these pipes are still

27:43.037 --> 27:44.322
the Tara Reid of karaoke.

27:44.539 --> 27:46.325
I'm thinking ancestor.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.202
The first siren,
Heathcliff.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.874
And the key to
saving the world.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.587
Hey.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.138
Hm.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.886
Thought he'd be taller.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.058
[JACK] And you
must be Mackenzie.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.681
It's a pleasure.

28:09.897 --> 28:10.807
I'd shake your hand, but...

28:11.023 --> 28:11.933
[KENZI]
Mm. I'm gonna hold off

28:12.149 --> 28:13.480
on any reciprocation
for the moment,

28:13.693 --> 28:15.024
but thank you.

28:15.236 --> 28:16.476
And you're funny.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.311
That's your gift.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.530
I brought you something.

28:24.745 --> 28:26.576
The Vanishing.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.826
[B0] A little birdie told me
it contains "The First Song."

28:30.042 --> 28:31.998
How does it work?

28:32.211 --> 28:35.544
A true Siren
sings "The First Song"

28:35.756 --> 28:37.917
at the one
they intend to banish.

28:38.134 --> 28:39.749
It's that easy?

28:39.969 --> 28:41.334
[JACK]
I see a painting.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.090
I do not see a siren.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.716
Oh we're covered.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.218
[clears throat] I mean,
we have a lead.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.221
The siren's song needs
to come into contact

28:49.437 --> 28:51.223
with the person
you're banishing.

28:51.439 --> 28:54.897
Putting them in that line
of fire may prove difficult.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.610
Difficult's my middle name.

28:56.819 --> 28:58.400
Ah, come on,
that's not true.

28:58.613 --> 28:59.398
[BO] You're right,

28:59.614 --> 29:01.229
I don't have a middle name.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.064
Is that what
you've been told?

29:06.996 --> 29:08.702
A warning, if I may.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.701
[JACK] "The First Song"
can work on you, too.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.703
That's why I sent
Persephone for it.

29:12.919 --> 29:15.251
To protect you from Zee.

29:15.463 --> 29:18.876
But what if she
directs it at you?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.752
I'll side step.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.964
If you were Zee
and you lost everyone,

29:28.184 --> 29:29.094
where would you go?

29:29.310 --> 29:31.016
Uh... I'd be hiding from my

29:31.228 --> 29:33.014
brother slash enemy so I
don't get vanished again.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.219
If we use the
painting as bait,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.850
it'll make her
too suspicious.

29:36.067 --> 29:37.978
Mmm...
Jimmy Choo trunk sale?

29:38.194 --> 29:39.684
No.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.269
Family.

29:41.489 --> 29:43.525
And | knowjust the person.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.406
[PERSEPHONE]
I will not do it.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.200
I haven't seen Zee
in hundreds of years

29:48.412 --> 29:49.572
and I plan to
keep it that way.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.371
You are her daughter.
You are free in the world.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.368
And we know mothers.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.699
She's gonna wanna
control that shit.

29:54.919 --> 29:56.079
She imprisoned me.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.251
[KENZI] So send her back
to where she came from!

29:58.464 --> 30:00.045
You don't know
what she's capable of.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.794
Dude, in god-years, you're
basically still a teenager.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.797
Where's the snarky 'tude?
The rebelliousness?

30:06.013 --> 30:09.096
Don't you want to lock
her up like she did to you?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.641
Even after everything
she did to you...

30:16.857 --> 30:19.439
I know it's ridiculous,
but she is still my--

30:19.652 --> 30:22.689
[30}
Your mother. I get it.

30:22.905 --> 30:26.113
But Persephone, if you
don't go after her first,

30:26.325 --> 30:27.861
she will come for you.

30:28.077 --> 30:29.908
But what if
one of us gets hurt?

30:30.121 --> 30:31.611
She's dangerous.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.947
[LAUREN] You'll have
a medic standing by.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.201
Lauren.

30:35.418 --> 30:37.249
I came to talk to you.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.416
Looks like
we have a mission to

30:38.629 --> 30:40.335
take down Zee, first.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.751
What kind of breach?

30:42.967 --> 30:44.923
[DYSON] A human has
found out about us.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.843
[TRICK] The same human
bunking in your boxing gym?

30:48.055 --> 30:50.011
Well. That is a problem.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.055
[TRICK] You know the rules
as well as I do, Dyson.

30:52.268 --> 30:55.135
She's at risk.
And she is a risk.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.640
I don't want her harmed.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.643
[TRICK] Well then there are
ways of making her forget.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.520
No. She's been
through enough already.

31:01.736 --> 31:03.351
I don't wanna
do that to her.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.653
Then I think you know
what you need to do.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.079
Haven't heard
your dove call in ages.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.907
Hello mother.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.495
How you've grown.

31:23.716 --> 31:26.128
One has to when
they're banished to Hell.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.132
How could you
let him take me?

31:31.348 --> 31:32.633
[ZEE]
I negotiated your release.

31:32.850 --> 31:36.138
You were supposed to
return to me, to Demeter.

31:36.353 --> 31:38.514
But you always were a snacker.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.642
So it's my fault.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.019
I ate the seeds,
I sealed my fate?

31:43.235 --> 31:45.942
Persephone,
I have made mistakes.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.737
And my mistakes
have left me alone.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.942
Forgive me?

32:00.169 --> 32:03.127
It's a trap.

32:07.051 --> 32:09.838
Out of all the people
who wanna screw me...

32:10.054 --> 32:13.046
[ZEE] I never thought it
would be my little girl.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.005
Like you said...

32:15.226 --> 32:17.512
Tartarus has been good to me.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.971
Now! Sing the notes!

32:23.859 --> 32:26.145
hhundeﬂ

32:26.362 --> 32:28.444
[KENZI] Heath! Heath!

32:28.656 --> 32:31.022
[ZEE] What's wrong?
Stage fright?

32:31.242 --> 32:33.107
Don't move or I'll
turn you all to dust.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.487
Can she really do that?

32:34.703 --> 32:35.863
Yes.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.036
[ZEE] Now hand over
the Siren.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.865
There's a song
I've been dying to hear.

32:41.085 --> 32:43.576
It's called, um...

32:43.796 --> 32:46.003
"Succubus Go Bye Bye."

32:50.678 --> 32:51.713
Do your thing, Siren.

32:51.929 --> 32:53.169
How is he
supposed to sing?

32:53.389 --> 32:54.879
You electrocuted his throat!

32:55.099 --> 32:56.384
Oh please. It was
just a little zap.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.340
Yeah causing his
vocal chords to seize.

32:58.561 --> 33:01.052
Zee, we're family.

33:01.272 --> 33:03.354
[30}
Let's talk about this.

33:03.566 --> 33:04.976
[ZEE]
Sing the notes, old man.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.898
[H EATHCLIFF groans]

33:07.111 --> 33:09.898
If you're broken, I'll have
to put you down for good.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.025
[HEATHCLIFF]
I've lived a long time.

33:12.241 --> 33:14.072
Retirement's not so bad.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.241
Bo. I can't see him--

33:16.453 --> 33:19.069
Not like Hale--
Not again--Please--

33:20.457 --> 33:22.322
Stop.

33:22.543 --> 33:26.127
If you vanish me,
let everybody else go.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.248
I don't like this deal.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.214
Bo.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.130
I'll find my way back.

33:32.178 --> 33:35.545
Lauren, help Heathcliff
restore his voice

33:35.764 --> 33:37.174
so he can sing me away.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.514
Please. Do it.

33:45.274 --> 33:47.105
Lauren! Seriously?

33:56.160 --> 34:00.494
So? What's the diagnosis?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.948
A serious case of bitch.

34:04.168 --> 34:14.169
[sirens]

34:15.179 --> 34:17.340
[breathes heavily]

34:17.556 --> 34:18.841
Holy shit.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.047
What she said.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.679
What the hell was that?

34:22.895 --> 34:27.264
That, um, is the thing that
we have to talk about.

34:39.662 --> 34:40.868
[DYSON]
Thank you for meeting me.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.492
Yeah, well I don't
have a lot of time.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.868
That's not true.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.246
You ought to be
used to that.

34:48.462 --> 34:52.922
I won't apologize for
hiding myself or my kind.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.169
[DYSON]
We tread cautiously.

34:55.386 --> 34:57.001
It's how we live.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.427
Especially me.

34:58.639 --> 35:00.470
I thought you trusted me.

35:00.683 --> 35:03.470
Well that's something
that's hard for me to do.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.682
[DYSON] I didn't
want to hurt you.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.731
Will you let me
make it up to you?

35:24.832 --> 35:26.242
Enjoy.

35:28.919 --> 35:29.999
That must be Trick.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.670
How did you--
Mark, of course.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.917
So everyone in here is--

35:38.137 --> 35:40.674
All Fae, yes.

35:40.889 --> 35:41.799
Some of them are staring.

35:42.016 --> 35:44.928
It's creepy. It's like
they're hungry...

35:45.144 --> 35:47.135
Well we can smell a human.

35:47.354 --> 35:51.142
And some of us do not like
them as much as others.

35:53.694 --> 35:57.812
Don't worry. Nothing's
gonna happen to you.

35:58.032 --> 36:01.195
I want you to be
part of this world.

36:01.410 --> 36:04.117
[DYSON]
That's why I'm um...

36:04.330 --> 36:06.286
claiming you.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.034
Claiming me?

36:08.250 --> 36:13.165
It means to--to the
Fae, anyway, um...

36:13.380 --> 36:15.371
that I... own you.

36:15.591 --> 36:16.501
[h uffs]

36:16.717 --> 36:17.923
And that's my cue to go.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.750
[DYSON] A-Alicia,
its not--not like that,

36:19.970 --> 36:22.052
not own own, it's...

36:22.264 --> 36:25.256
like a cross to bear;
like a responsibility.

36:25.476 --> 36:28.138
Wow, so I'm like
a burden to you.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.140
[DYSON] Alicia, please.

36:30.356 --> 36:33.063
I'm not very good at this.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.391
I've never done this before.

36:35.611 --> 36:38.978
Wait, you've never
done this before?

36:39.198 --> 36:41.610
Claimed a human,
or whatever it is.

36:41.825 --> 36:44.157
Never had a reason to.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.201
Until now.

36:49.249 --> 36:53.367
Claiming lets the others
know that you're part of us.

36:53.587 --> 36:56.920
That you're accepted.

36:57.132 --> 36:59.214
Sounds like a commitment.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.803
You're not gonna get down
on one knee are you?

37:04.181 --> 37:06.672
[DYSON] Not quite.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.508
But it does mean you get
one helluva drinking buddy.

37:18.987 --> 37:21.148
Exhibit A.

37:21.365 --> 37:23.276
Is that all I am
to you these days?

37:23.492 --> 37:24.151
An exhibit?

37:24.368 --> 37:25.824
[scoffs]

37:26.036 --> 37:27.151
[sighs] Go on then,
hurry up, doc.

37:27.371 --> 37:29.737
Last time you did this
I was wrecked for hours.

37:34.336 --> 37:35.200
Okay, I get it.

37:35.421 --> 37:36.285
This is getting
embarrassing.

37:36.505 --> 37:37.915
[VEX chuckles]

37:40.801 --> 37:41.631
Whoa.

37:41.844 --> 37:42.629
What do you think?

37:42.845 --> 37:44.756
I said "whoa."

37:44.972 --> 37:47.588
That's how I sucked your chi
and survived the accident.

37:47.808 --> 37:49.344
You can be whatever
Fae you're touching.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.596
[LAUREN] The same way I extracted
the Fae from the Morrigan,

37:51.812 --> 37:54.019
only I've made myself
a temporary conduit

37:54.231 --> 37:56.096
of whatever Fae
I'm in contact with.

37:56.316 --> 37:58.773
And you can weaken them
while you're at it.

37:58.986 --> 38:00.192
You're not feeling this?

38:00.404 --> 38:02.065
If you weakened Vex,
why not me?

38:02.281 --> 38:04.567
Succubus genetics.
Rapid healing.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.195
Apologies if I'm gonna
kill some buzz here,

38:07.411 --> 38:09.447
but if you thought
your Fae-to-human serum

38:09.663 --> 38:12.200
was a threat, this is
a million times worse.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.077
[VEX] And what happens
when the colony finds out?

38:14.293 --> 38:16.375
What happens when
Evony finds out?

38:16.587 --> 38:18.248
Why would they find out?

38:18.464 --> 38:21.126
You're not gonna talk.
Are you?

38:21.341 --> 38:23.468
I better get
a prize for this.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.630
If you're wondering how
I know how to read music.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.967
Grade four band. Recorder.
Top of my class.

38:35.731 --> 38:39.144
You're not happy
about this, are you?

38:39.359 --> 38:43.568
Lauren, I love you for
who you are as a person.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.190
[BO] I don't care if
you're human or Fae.

38:45.407 --> 38:49.025
I just--as long
as you're you.

38:49.244 --> 38:52.361
What if this is me,
but with benefits?

38:52.581 --> 38:53.536
I get to help
people for longer.

38:53.749 --> 38:54.784
"The Eternal Healer."

38:55.000 --> 38:57.707
Yes, I've coined
myself a little name.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.002
[LAUREN]
And then the obvious, Bo.

39:00.214 --> 39:02.421
| get to be
with you forever.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.123
But are you Fae
or just a conduit?

39:04.343 --> 39:05.173
I don't understand.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.841
I haven't figured
that out yet.

39:07.054 --> 39:09.295
Let's just say that it's a
step in the right direction.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.255
Injecting all these
abilities into your body--

39:12.559 --> 39:14.720
I've been examined.
| show no signs

39:14.937 --> 39:16.393
that this is affecting
me negatively.

39:16.605 --> 39:17.435
Who examined you?

39:17.648 --> 39:19.639
It doesn't matter. Bo.

39:19.858 --> 39:20.973
I want this.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.683
For me.

39:22.903 --> 39:24.393
For us.

39:26.490 --> 39:28.230
Don't you want it too?

39:29.451 --> 39:30.987
Of course I do.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.411
Of course I do.

39:43.340 --> 39:45.456
I'm sorry you had to
go through all that.

39:45.676 --> 39:46.256
A few days back and already

39:46.468 --> 39:48.174
your life's
been put in danger.

39:48.387 --> 39:52.505
Yeah. I wouldn't
have it any other way.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.841
Hey how about I
stick around for a bit.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.643
Dirty up this house and home,
spread out a little.

39:58.855 --> 40:02.313
As much as I want to,
I can't let you do that.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.562
You have your own life.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.939
Just until things with you
and Jack-daddy settle down.

40:07.155 --> 40:10.022
It's because of Jack
that I want you to go.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.322
He's dangerous.

40:11.535 --> 40:13.776
And I want him gone.

40:13.996 --> 40:16.578
Because... you could
have used that painting

40:16.790 --> 40:18.655
to get rid of him,
but you didn't.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.287
You chose Zee instead.

40:21.503 --> 40:23.960
Why did you do that?

40:24.172 --> 40:26.458
I don't know.

40:26.675 --> 40:27.960
Bo.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.667
I don't know how I feel
about all this, Kenz.

40:34.099 --> 40:37.887
It's complicated. I know.

40:38.103 --> 40:41.015
You don't think it's crazy
that I want him to stay?

40:41.231 --> 40:42.311
Not at all.

40:42.524 --> 40:43.980
He's your father.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.057
Just until I get answers.

40:46.278 --> 40:50.897
You get what you need,
but do not trust him.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.822
He's smart and dangerous.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.868
[KENZI] Promise me
you'll be careful.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.410
I will be.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.909
Now get up here
and give me a hug.

41:06.590 --> 41:09.832
With everything
so crazy right now,

41:10.052 --> 41:12.714
having you back,
even for a bit...

41:12.929 --> 41:15.181
[sighs] it helped.

41:16.683 --> 41:19.800
[speaking Russian]

41:20.020 --> 41:22.432
Something my mom
used to say.

41:22.648 --> 41:27.108
"Don't try and be
too smart, darlin'.

41:27.319 --> 41:29.150
It might get you killed."

41:30.822 --> 41:32.403
[KENZI] Okay.

41:35.202 --> 41:37.113
Love ya.

41:51.802 --> 41:53.633
You owe me.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.301
[ZEE] Nice magic trick.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.254
Rewriting "The First Song."

41:57.474 --> 42:00.261
They not only bought it,
they wrapped it up with a bow.

42:00.477 --> 42:02.559
Wrapped it up with a bow.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.432
You didn't hesitate vanishing
Hera, Iris, and me

42:04.648 --> 42:08.766
all those years ago.
Why not do it again?

42:08.985 --> 42:12.148
Your time will come.

42:12.364 --> 42:13.979
When it's just.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.734
What are you
doing here, Jack?

42:21.164 --> 42:22.745
What?

42:25.460 --> 42:26.916
[JACK] Are you gonna
try and stop me?

42:27.129 --> 42:29.120
In that body?

42:31.675 --> 42:33.961
Whatever you do,

42:34.177 --> 42:36.042
leave my daughter alone.

42:36.263 --> 42:37.628
Mine turned on me,
so what makes you think

42:37.848 --> 42:40.009
that Bo won't do
the same to you?

42:40.225 --> 42:42.386
Controversial, I know.
But I believe

42:42.602 --> 42:44.729
father knows best.

42:44.938 --> 42:47.520
And Bo will come
to believe it too.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.525
[JACK] Brother.

42:52.738 --> 42:56.401
There is no point
in resisting me.

42:56.616 --> 42:58.572
It has begun.

43:18.472 --> 43:25.059
[hums]

43:26.146 --> 43:27.602
[JACK] Ah!

43:35.906 --> 43:40.900
[closing theme]
