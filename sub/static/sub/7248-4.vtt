00:02.240 --> 00:03.719
Previously on Gilmore Girls. 

00:03.800 --> 00:07.200
- Oh, my God, I'm going to Chilton?
- You did it, babe. You got in.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.680
- I told Mom you're changing schools.
- Is she thrilled?

00:09.760 --> 00:10.720
The party's on Friday.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
Are you moving?

00:11.880 --> 00:12.920
No, just my books are.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.160
- Ready?
- Yes.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.800
Headmaster Charleston will see you.

00:15.880 --> 00:19.240
You may have been the smartest
at Stars Hollow, but it's different here.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.600
You'll never catch up,
and you'll never beat me.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.480
There's a good chance you will fail.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.240
- Who's that?
- New girl.

00:25.320 --> 00:29.040
Stay out of my way.
I will make this school a living hell for you.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.120
See you tomorrow, Mary.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.880
- They kept calling me Mary.
- Mary, like Virgin Mary.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.080
What if I had looked like a slut?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.640
They might have added
a "Magdalene" to it.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.440
- Shopping for school supplies. Party.
- Nobody demanded that you come.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.000
Are you kidding?
How often do you do things like this?

00:46.040 --> 00:49.400
While we're going crazy,
we should get toilet paper and a plunger.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.520
I'll do this later.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.560
- No, I'm teasing. Get that list of yours.
- Okay.

00:55.480 --> 00:57.600
- I need legal pads...
- Got it.

00:57.680 --> 01:02.000
...tons of pens, some number 2 pencils,
three highlighters, an eraser...

01:02.080 --> 01:04.200
a staple remover, and a folder.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.400
- You need three highlighters?
- Yes.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.960
- That's a very random number.
- It is not random.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.080
How did you get to the number three?

01:11.160 --> 01:13.160
One dries up, one gets lost, I have one left.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.880
- You've really thought this out.
- Yes.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.680
What came first, the chicken or the egg?

01:16.760 --> 01:20.160
- Can we get back to the list?
- All right. Hey, legal pads.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.960
- No. Those are purple.
- Yes. Purple is festive.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.120
- I can't have purple.
- You can. They're on sale.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.560
I'm going to a serious school.
I need serious paper.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.320
- Paper is paper.
- Not at Chilton.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.920
- All right, fine. Here's your serious paper.
- Thank you.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.360
And here are your somber highlighters,
your maudlin pencils...

01:38.440 --> 01:40.680
- your manic-depressive pens.
- Mom.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.840
These erasers are on lithium.
So they seem cheerful...

01:43.920 --> 01:47.160
but we caught them trying to
shove themselves in the pencil sharpener.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.360
- I'm going home.
- No, wait.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.760
We're gonna stage an intervention
with the neon Post-its...

01:51.800 --> 01:54.080
and make them give up
their wacky, crazy ways.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.040
You're never
coming shopping with me again.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.360
Here's a card tray. Everything is gonna...

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.280 --> 03:32.520
Decent effort by most.
Good effort by some.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.640
Exceptional effort by two.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.400
Ms. Geller. Ms. Grant.

03:40.920 --> 03:44.360
Mr. Graham. Ms. Gilmore.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.520
Take these home.
Learn from your mistakes.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.040
Look at the large red circles
around various parts of your papers...

03:53.120 --> 03:55.840
as friendly reminders that to err is human.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.000
And that here at Chilton, we try to
beat that humanity right out of you.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.520
Okay, next up, the test.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.600
The dreaded test. Shakespeare!

04:05.840 --> 04:08.920
The man we've been droning on about
for the last three weeks...

04:08.960 --> 04:11.800
finally comes back to haunt us on Friday.

04:12.360 --> 04:15.800
This is a big one, my friends.
Multiple-choice, with an essay section...

04:15.840 --> 04:19.160
that will count for 20% of your grade
this semester.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.040
Don't be fooled by my kind face
and charming personality.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.520
This test will be hard,
and there will be no make-ups.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.560
Refer to the study materials
I gave you at the beginning of the month...

04:29.640 --> 04:32.920
and those extensive notes
I know you've been taking.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.640
- Hard paper.
- Killer.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.200
- How did you do?
- "A."

04:37.280 --> 04:38.280
Me, too!

04:38.360 --> 04:39.720
- Small world.
- Isn't it?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.600
- Madeline, what did you get?
- You know I got a "B."

04:42.680 --> 04:45.280
- A "B's" not bad. It's respectable even.
- Not at all.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.320
I'd be proud.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.960
A "D," however,
that would be cause for concern.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.160
A cry for help.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.000
A job application at McDonald's.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.680
"Would you like fries with that?"

04:54.760 --> 04:57.360
Hey, you know,
not everybody can be smart.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.520
As my mother always says,
"Somebody has to answer the phones."

05:00.600 --> 05:02.960
I have no idea
what you two are talking about.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.200
No, but Rory does.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.320
Hey, Mary!

05:11.360 --> 05:13.520
And it just keeps getting better.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.320
- You look sad.
- I'm fine.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.520
- Bad grade?
- I have to go.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.600
Mary, I just can't figure out
why we're not friends.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.560
I think it's because I make you nervous.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.560
I think it's because
you can't learn my name.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.800
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- None of your business.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.400
- Is that a no?
- Is there no one else you can bother?

05:29.480 --> 05:32.680
I think you like me.
You just don't know how to say it.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.880
- So what are you doing Friday night?
- I'm busy.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.320
What, you gotta be back
at the convent by 5:00?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.000
Please leave me alone.

05:39.080 --> 05:41.480
All right. Since you said "please."

05:42.400 --> 05:44.080
Later, Mary.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.360
- You imbecile!
- Back off, chevalier.

05:54.400 --> 05:57.360
- You're stupid, blind, and clumsy.
- At least I'm not French.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.200
- What's going on?
- She ran over my shoe.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.840
- He got in the way.
- You aimed for me.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.480
- Hold on.
- She scratched my shoes.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.120
- What a baby.
- These are $300 Italian loafers.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.360
I wonder if Versace makes a pacifier.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.440
- You're fired.
- You can't fire me.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.280
- Then I dock your pay. Can I kill her?
- Not before high tea.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.840
Fine. Then I will curse you constantly
and in several languages.

06:20.920 --> 06:24.680
- I'm going for the other foot.
- Don't! Drella, to your corner now.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.160
I win.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.760
Michel, you're a grown man.
Now go to your desk and act like one.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.040
Oh, my God.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.640
- Okay, just a minute.
- I've got it.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
The review?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.240
- It's here.
- Where is it?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.120
- I'm looking.
- Hurry.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.520
Behold, in theaters now,
The Thing That Reads A Lot.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.800
- Chocolate?
- Glass measuring cup.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.640
- Lorelai, look.
- I'm sorry.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.520
- Jeez, who's naked?
- Lucien Mills, food critic.

07:05.600 --> 07:06.800
Yeah? How's his butt?

07:06.840 --> 07:10.280
He was supposed to review the restaurant.
Here it is.

07:10.360 --> 07:13.280
Is it good? Is he mean? Should I cry?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.080
Here we go.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.880
"The words "divine,"
"delectable," and "delirious"..."

07:17.960 --> 07:20.320
"don't begin to describe
the delicious experience..."

07:20.400 --> 07:23.560
"of dining at the Independence Inn."
I'm smelling rave.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.680
Really?

07:24.760 --> 07:27.320
"Only Chef Sookie St. James
could make a simple salad..."

07:27.400 --> 07:32.040
"of hothouse tomatoes and assorted fresh
herbs seem like a religious experience."

07:32.120 --> 07:35.720
"Her lobster bisque is worth
every sinful, cream-filled, rich sip."

07:35.800 --> 07:39.560
See, I don't use that much cream. I just
use a very concentrated lobster stock.

07:39.640 --> 07:42.000
- And it really makes it...
- He's not here.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.040
Okay, go on.

07:43.120 --> 07:45.200
"The entrees are
as heavenly as the starters."

07:45.280 --> 07:47.720
"Though the much-lauded risotto
was perfectly fine..."

07:47.800 --> 07:50.960
"it was the handkerchief pasta
with brown sage in a butter sauce..."

07:51.040 --> 07:52.840
"that sent me through the roof."

07:52.920 --> 07:56.240
This is unbelievable! I'm gonna
have this framed for the dining room!

07:56.320 --> 07:59.400
Yeah, that'd be swell.
Can I see that again?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.720
So we should celebrate tonight, huh?
Girls on the town?

08:03.760 --> 08:05.320
I can't. I have to study.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.160
I should really get started
on this shopping list.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.840
What is going on here?
We are young and fiery women.

08:12.040 --> 08:14.360
Studying? Shopping lists?

08:14.440 --> 08:18.720
Where's "To hell with it all"?
Where's "Throwing caution to the wind"?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.400
Where... Shoot, the linen delivery.

08:22.320 --> 08:23.800
You go, girl.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.240
...and the Person of the Week segment.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.600
- News is on!
- One sec.

08:32.240 --> 08:36.799
For our top story tonight, a grisly,
horrible thing happened in a small town...

08:36.880 --> 08:40.320
where no grisly, horrible things
ever happen. Everyone's shocked!

08:40.559 --> 08:44.560
House slides down hill.
Liposuction kills. Stay fat.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.240
Hey, let's get ice cream. I'm bored.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.440
Hello?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.200
Mom, I'm studying.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.480
But I'm talking ice cream.
Can't you take a break?

08:57.560 --> 09:00.920
- I can't take a break right now.
- Okay. When?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.680
- Are you four?
- No, I'm hungry.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.680
- Have some more pizza.
- It's cold.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.760
- Heat it up.
- It's not the same.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.760
Lorelai, go to your room!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.840
Wow, smart girls are mean.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.760
If you let me study now,
I'll play with you this weekend.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.680
- Promise?
- Yes. We can do anything you want.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.640
- Will you go to the shoe sale with me?
- Yes.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.800
- Will you let me try on anything I want?
- Yes.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.520
Will you help push people away
if they go for my size?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.440
I'll even run interference for you.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.960
- All right, you've got a deal.
- Good.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.880
So, I'm sorry. Where did we land
on the whole ice cream issue?

09:44.560 --> 09:45.720
What?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.440
- Right or left?
- Left.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
I thought you said left.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.240
- Sorry. My left, your right.
- Okay.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.640
Marco.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.320
Polo.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.720
Hey, Marco.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.160
Hey, Polo.

10:44.920 --> 10:46.720
- You're late.
- Sorry.

10:48.960 --> 10:50.440
What is that?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.360
12 calories.

10:52.800 --> 10:55.000
- Here.
- Oh, my God. Bless you.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.360
- Man, what's that?
- My notes.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.080
Really?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.640
I don't think Shakespeare
knew himself this well.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.240
I like. How much?

11:08.480 --> 11:10.640
- $500.
- Is that the best you can do?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.760
- $450.
- I'm not so sure.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.080
$375 and you take it right now.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.880
- Sold.
- We appreciate your business.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.040
Move.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.800
I really miss Stars Hollow High.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.320
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Chilton's just...

11:28.760 --> 11:30.560
I don't know, hard.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.400
What do you care? You were always
Miss Everything's-So-Easy-At-School.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.680
This should be a snap for you.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.760
Nope. This is sold. Move.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.280
- What's that?
- That's mine.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.640
That is chocolate-covered death.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.280
With a creamy caramel surprise.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.200
- So, this guy asked about you today.
- What guy?

11:56.640 --> 11:59.080
The new kid. Tall, perfect.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.160
- What did he want to know?
- Where you were.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.280
What did you say?

12:03.360 --> 12:07.160
I told him you were too smart for us
and you had to go to the genius school.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.560
He really liked that.
I guess he's into brainy chicks.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.520
I'll keep my eyes open for one for him.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.560
- No. Sold. Move.
- Mom.

12:17.640 --> 12:20.280
- Where do you want us to go?
- Library.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.520
I hate sales.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.640
No Black Sabbath.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.960
No one's listening.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.360
No Black Sabbath, no Steely Dan,
no Boston, and no Queen.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.680
What happened to make you so cold?

12:36.760 --> 12:40.800
- You like that Mozart.
- I am the Artie Shaw of harpists.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.400
- Sookie, I need coffee to go.
- There's fresh over there.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.520
Good.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.360
Fresh in my first lifetime as Joan of Arc.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.920
Sorry. I thought I made fresh. Here.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.520
Bless you. I'm so exhausted,
and I have to drive to Hartford tonight...

13:01.600 --> 13:04.120
- to go to a parent-teacher meeting.
- Sounds great.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.560
This school is so different
from Stars Hollow.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.400
They send home a thousand pages
of updates every week.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.520
It's a very intense place.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.360
Last week, there was this huge debate...

13:14.440 --> 13:17.240
over whether plaid scrunchies
were acceptable headwear.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.800
People took sides. Things got ugly.
The scrunchy motion finally passed...

13:20.880 --> 13:24.400
- and I like to think I was the tiebreaker.
- That's nice.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.560
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?

13:27.160 --> 13:29.840
- He said it was fine.
- Who said it was fine?

13:29.920 --> 13:31.880
- Lucien Mills.
- The restaurant critic?

13:31.960 --> 13:34.520
- He said my risotto was fine.
- Isn't it?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.200
No, it's not fine.

13:36.280 --> 13:39.120
Fine is a word you use
when someone stops you on the street...

13:39.200 --> 13:41.120
that you know,
but you don't want to talk to.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.160
They ask you how you are,
and you say "Fine."

13:43.240 --> 13:47.200
That's enough so they don't have to keep
talking to you, "cause they don't want to.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.760
Then they can feel good because
they've been considerate enough to ask...

13:50.840 --> 13:53.080
and if, God forbid,
something actually is wrong...

13:53.160 --> 13:56.360
they'll sit down, take time and listen,
even if they don't want to.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.440
I don't think he meant fine
as a slam or as a monologue.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.640
He couldn't have meant it any other way.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.920
I hate to see you get so upset
over one little review.

14:05.960 --> 14:09.720
This is pride, Lorelai.
I mean, you know about this risotto.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.520
- On my mother's deathbed...
- You made the risotto...

14:12.600 --> 14:15.680
- and she lived three more years.
- She was supposed to be dead.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.040
The doctor said
she wouldn't live through the night.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.640
And she lived because of the risotto,
the magic risotto.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.280
And this guy had the nerve to say
it was fine.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
I don't think he knew the story.

14:27.680 --> 14:31.720
Okay. Before you get all goofy on me,
I don't have your porcinis.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.760
I forgot them.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.440
I don't have any other excuse,
other than plain, old, stupid human error.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.960
I have the morels, which I know you
don't want, so come on, let me have it.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.640
Morels are fine.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.560
Did anyone else feel the shift
in the space-time continuum?

14:47.640 --> 14:52.200
- A reviewer didn't like the risotto.
- The magic risotto? You're kidding.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.040
I gotta go.
So try and cheer her up, would you?

14:56.080 --> 14:57.200
Sure.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.680
Sweetie, please don't worry about it.
Everyone knows you're the best.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.360
So...

15:10.080 --> 15:13.760
I hear the huckleberry crop"s
gonna totally suck this year.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.640
We are gonna be focusing
on Elizabethan literature.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.360
Shakespeare, Marlowe, Bacon,
Ben Jonson, John Webster.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.760
Is Marlowe really that significant?

15:25.840 --> 15:28.720
We want to give
as complete an overview as possible.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.800
Yes, but will he be included
on the advanced placement test?

15:31.840 --> 15:34.320
We can't know exactly
what will be on the AP test...

15:34.400 --> 15:38.040
but it will be important
when your kids hit their universities.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.560
But to get there
they need to pass the AP test.

15:40.640 --> 15:43.560
Right, it's all important.
It could all be on the test.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.200
How do we find out?

15:45.280 --> 15:48.160
You could bribe somebody
on the AP Committee.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.240
I was kidding. I'm just kidding.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.720
I'm so sorry.
I had a terrible pothole incident.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.480
You don't care. So please, go on.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.200
What in the world?

16:04.360 --> 16:05.640
You okay?

16:05.960 --> 16:09.080
- I'll just sit now.
- I don't think we've met.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.920
I'm Lorelai Gilmore. Rory's mom.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.920
Glad you could join us.
Rory's one of our new students.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.160
How nice. Now, the AP test.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.720
Right. Well, we are preparing them
as best we can.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.640
I've hired a tutor for Bethany.

16:23.720 --> 16:25.560
Always a valid option.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.600
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the camel!

16:29.960 --> 16:31.960
This is really bad coffee.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.600
So, this AP test,
what are we gonna do about it?

16:37.240 --> 16:39.760
The next test is scheduled for next month.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.000
The 25th, Saturday, at 7:00 a.m.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.680
- Ms. Gilmore?
- Where is the test?

16:49.280 --> 16:51.520
- It will be given here.
- Here?

16:51.640 --> 16:53.160
- Right.
- Great.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.600
- Any other questions?
- Yeah.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.520
Can parents come?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.480
What?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.480
Yeah, it's a big, exciting test.
So I just thought...

17:05.560 --> 17:08.240
- I'm sorry. Is that stupid?
- No, it's not stupid.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.640
I just thought
I'd like to see the excitement.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.359
- It's a test.
- Yeah, I know.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.000
What's exciting about a test?

17:14.079 --> 17:15.720
- Do you play golf?
- Yes, I do.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.280
- You explain yours, I'll explain mine.
- Why not get back to the meeting?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.760
That's the one who voted
for the scrunchies.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.960
Must be a scholarship student.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.319
Excuse me.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.319
You know what? I think this would be
a good time for a break.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.480
There's coffee in the back.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.120
What were you gonna do? Hit her?

17:44.200 --> 17:47.200
No. I had some
good verbal comebacks ready.

17:50.840 --> 17:54.560
- It just keeps getting worse.
- Not drinking it is always an option.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.040
Not in my world.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.520
- I'm Max Medina.
- Nice to meet you.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.320
I apologize for the behavior
of some of our guests tonight.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.240
It's a tense time for some people.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.560
- The SAT season?
- The waking hours.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.080
- Are you this nice to my kid?
- It's easy.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.160
- Rory's a sweet girl.
- Yeah, she is.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.000
How is she liking Chilton?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.280
- She loves it.
- Really?

18:22.360 --> 18:27.200
Yeah. It's an adjustment, of course.
But she's always wanted to go to Harvard.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.920
- This is how she'll get there.
- Harvard?

18:30.120 --> 18:33.320
Ever since she could crawl,
I've really wanted her to go there.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.560
It's a great school.

18:34.640 --> 18:37.360
I bought her a Harvard sweatshirt
when she was four.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.120
Of course, it was way too big for her.

18:39.200 --> 18:44.160
So she used it as a blanket for a while,
and then as a diaper on this shopping trip.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.920
And now I've told you a story
that would so mortify her...

18:47.000 --> 18:48.960
she'll kill me
when she finds out you know.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.800
- Don't tell her then. It'll be our secret.
- I appreciate that.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.240
So, are you a B-52's girl?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.360
What?

19:01.280 --> 19:06.120
No, I'm a klutz girl who should not drive
with coffee in her hand.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.640
I had this in the car.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.560
I hope Rory adjusts to this place.
We need her here.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.640
Thank you. That's so nice.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.200
I hope she's not too disappointed
about her paper.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.880
It's very hard to catch up
on all that reading material.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.840
- I know a "D" seems pretty dismal...
- Rory got a "D"?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.520
- Yeah, but...
- She's never gotten a "D."

19:27.600 --> 19:30.960
It's the first paper she's turning in.
She's bound to falter a little.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.520
This totally explains
the no ice-cream thing.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.240
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- The ice-cream thing?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.400
Look, I've gotta go.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.920
I'm sorry if I said something to offend you.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.520
No. If Rory got a "D,"
she's not feeling too good right now.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.760
- And I'd really like to be there.
- I understand.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.000
So, it was nice meeting you.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.600
You, too.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.000
- Keep up the good work.
- I will.

19:55.040 --> 19:59.280
- Don't ever make coffee ever again.
- I won"t, I promise.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.640
Thanks.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.520
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.160
- Here.
- What's that?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.840
- You look like you need pie.
- I do?

20:27.920 --> 20:30.680
Violent pencil-tossing
usually signals a need for pie.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.040
What if I'd thrown a pen?

20:32.120 --> 20:33.840
- I would've brought you a trout.
- What?

20:33.880 --> 20:36.360
I don't make the rules,
I just carry them out.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.520
Hey, backwards baseball hat.
New look for you.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.960
She's eating pie?
Did she even have dinner?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.120
You raised her. I just serve.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.640
- Hello, bookworm.
- Finally.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.920
- Where were you?
- Well, actually, I was in Hartford.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.560
Why?

21:06.640 --> 21:08.600
I was there for the...

21:09.480 --> 21:13.920
Parent-teacher meeting.
Oh, my God, I forgot.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.280
It went very well.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.560
I was extremely charming.
I won the whole crowd over.

21:18.640 --> 21:20.360
They made me queen.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.800
So, I guess you talked to Mr. Medina.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.880
Why did you let me whine
about ice cream and shoe sales...

21:27.960 --> 21:30.080
when you had something major going on?

21:30.160 --> 21:31.280
I know.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.960
I hate when I'm an idiot and don't know it.
I like to be aware of my idiocy.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.120
To revel in it, take pictures. We've missed
a prime Christmas-card opportunity.

21:39.200 --> 21:40.560
I'm sorry.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.600
You should have told me.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.240
I couldn"t.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.080
You couldn't tell me?
You tell me everything.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.680
It was too humiliating.

21:48.760 --> 21:52.280
Honey, you once told me that you loved
Saved By the Bell.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.960
What could be more humiliating than that?

21:55.000 --> 21:57.040
I couldn't form the words.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.640
I couldn't even say it.
I couldn't even comprehend it.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.160
It was a "D." I got a "D."

22:04.320 --> 22:06.800
- I've never gotten a "D." Ever.
- I know.

22:07.040 --> 22:09.760
Even when I broke my arm
and couldn't write for a month...

22:09.840 --> 22:11.320
I got an "A" minus.

22:11.400 --> 22:15.040
- That was a different school.
- I know. It was Stars Hollow High.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.240
A "D" at Stars Hollow
is like an "F" at Chilton.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.440
It's worse. It's like a "G" or a "W."

22:21.720 --> 22:24.880
So I'm guessing
the spelling test didn't go well either?

22:25.880 --> 22:27.120
A "D."

22:27.560 --> 22:28.680
I suck.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.360
You don't suck.

22:30.800 --> 22:34.960
- I can't do this.
- Listen, a "D" is bad, okay?

22:35.000 --> 22:38.040
But this talk about "I suck,"
"I can't do this," and self-pity...

22:38.120 --> 22:41.320
that's worse. That's not you.
You didn't feel sorry for yourself...

22:41.400 --> 22:44.080
when it took you three months
to learn how to ride a bike.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.560
Four months.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.280
It took me four months
to learn how to ride a bike.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.080
Really? Four months?

22:50.160 --> 22:52.320
Yeah. You wanna
belabor the conversation?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.880
Forget about the bike.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.920
Listen, a "D" is one grade.
It's not the end of the world.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.320
You'll catch up, you'll do better.
You are of hardy, stubborn stock.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.680
If there's one thing I gave you,
it's stubbornness.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.280
- I'm not stubborn.
- You are.

23:04.360 --> 23:05.840
- I'm not.
- Fine. You're not.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:07.440 --> 23:10.440
You can do this, and I'll help you.
I'll get you through this.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.320
Now put the "D" behind you.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.960
- What's next?
- I have a test on Friday.

23:15.040 --> 23:17.520
- A test. Great!
- On Shakespeare.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.680
The bard with a beard. Love it.

23:19.760 --> 23:22.400
- It's 20% of my grade.
- Just makes life interesting.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.640
Now what do we have to do
to get you an "A" on that test?

23:26.120 --> 23:28.240
Do you really think I can do this?

23:28.360 --> 23:30.000
I bet you $1.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.240
That's it? That's all my future's worth, $1?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.360
Well, you did get a "D."

23:42.040 --> 23:45.800
"Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments

23:45.840 --> 23:49.280
"Love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds

23:49.360 --> 23:51.640
"Or bends with the remover to remove

23:51.720 --> 23:54.200
"O, no! It is an ever-fixed mark

23:54.280 --> 23:56.920
"That looks on tempests
and is never shaken

23:57.000 --> 23:59.320
"It is the star to every wandering bark

23:59.400 --> 24:02.840
"Whose worth's unknown
although his height be taken"

24:04.320 --> 24:06.120
You're going down.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.960
Sookie, do you know
what the menu's gonna be...

24:15.640 --> 24:17.080
- Good?
- Hot.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.840
Wait. I got another one.

24:19.640 --> 24:20.920
- Better?
- Hotter.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.800
Wait. I got one more.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.680
What's with all the risotto?
Have we gone theme now?

24:28.760 --> 24:31.240
Is it gonna be like the Scotch tape store?

24:31.320 --> 24:34.040
Look, I've made 40 recipes, okay? 40.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.920
And every single time,
I come back to the same conclusion.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.320
That yours is better.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.360
- Yes.
- It is.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.120
- You were looking for me?
- Yes!

24:41.160 --> 24:43.840
Three weeks ago,
a guy comes in here, Lucien Mills...

24:43.920 --> 24:45.760
orders the risotto, doesn't like it.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.360
- The magic risotto? You're kidding.
- Not helping.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.640
He's a restaurant critic.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.400
He ordered lots of things,
probably didn't finish them.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.160
In his review,
he said his waiter had a goatee.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.240
You've got a goatee,
so you waited on him, and I need info.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.280
- What did he look like?
- Like he was unhappy with the risotto!

25:01.360 --> 25:02.960
Maybe he had an annoying companion...

25:03.040 --> 25:05.280
that wouldn't let him
concentrate on his eating.

25:05.360 --> 25:08.640
- I serve a lot of people.
- He had a beard, false teeth, or a wig...

25:08.720 --> 25:10.680
or the glasses with the big nose.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.720
- May I be fired now?
- Absolutely.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.640
What about a guy with
an annoying companion and a fake wig...

25:15.720 --> 25:17.720
sitting underneath
an air-conditioning vent...

25:17.760 --> 25:19.760
next to a woman
with too much perfume on?

25:20.400 --> 25:24.040
- The Comedy of Errors: Written?
- 1590.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.800
- Published?
- 1698.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.560
- 1623. Close.
- How is 1623 close?

25:30.640 --> 25:33.800
- You got the 16 part right.
- I was off by 75 years.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.840
Anything under 100 is close.

25:35.920 --> 25:39.640
- What kind of a rule is that?
- I'm running the study session here.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.080
- Okay. Richard III.
- 1591.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.520
"93?"96?

25:47.120 --> 25:49.560
Okay, that's getting really annoying now.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.760
Go on. I'm listening.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.560
The sonnets are 154 poems of 14 lines.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.200
- Except?
- Except for 126, which is 12 lines.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.440
Good.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.640
They're written in iambic pentameter.

26:08.120 --> 26:12.640
- Except?
- Except for 145, which is in tetrameter.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.520
- Rock on, sister.
- Really?

26:14.600 --> 26:18.080
- Not one mistake. How do you feel?
- Nauseous.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.000
I don't think the fries
and the horseradish sauce...

26:21.080 --> 26:22.720
was the best idea we ever had.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.880
It was satisfying in the moment, though.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.120
You're gonna
blow that class away tomorrow.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.680
- You think?
- I think.

26:28.760 --> 26:32.560
What do you say we call it a night
and get some beauty sleep?

26:32.680 --> 26:35.000
You go. I wanna review my notes
one more time.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.400
- That's okay. I'll stay up.
- Mom, go to sleep.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.720
No. I'm not even tired.
I was just thinking of you.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.960
No!

28:20.840 --> 28:24.080
Oh, jeez.
This was such a bad sleeping idea.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.560
- I'm late!
- What?

28:27.160 --> 28:30.880
- I'm late! I woke up late!
- Rory, calm down.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.920
I can't calm down!
I missed my bus! Get up!

28:34.000 --> 28:35.560
Mommy can't get up right now.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.440
Mommy's been sleeping
at a right angle all night.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.280
- I'm gonna miss the test!
- No, you're not.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.760
I'll get the keys.
We'll go right now. Let's go!

28:48.520 --> 28:50.840
- I can't take you.
- You have to!

28:50.920 --> 28:53.240
- I have a meeting at the Inn at 8:00!
- Mom!

28:53.320 --> 28:56.800
Okay, wait. Think. Listen. Here. You drive.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.480
- What?
- You drive. I'll get a ride from Sookie.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.320
Take the phone. Take the keys. Go!

29:01.400 --> 29:02.520
- Are you sure?
- Go!

29:02.600 --> 29:05.440
- I'm gone!
- Good luck!

29:25.680 --> 29:26.720
Hello?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.920
Did I leave a set of notes at your house?

29:29.000 --> 29:31.040
- Where are you?
- I'm driving to school.

29:31.120 --> 29:34.000
I need to check something
and I can't find some of my notes.

29:34.080 --> 29:35.880
Okay, hold on. Let me check.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.040
- I don't see anything.
- What did I do with them?

29:45.400 --> 29:48.560
- Maybe it's downstairs in the store?
- Maybe. I just...

29:49.040 --> 29:51.200
- Oh, my God!
- Are you all right?

29:52.600 --> 29:55.240
- I just got hit by a deer!
- You hit a deer?

29:55.320 --> 29:58.880
- No! I got hit by a deer.
- How do you get hit by a deer?

29:58.960 --> 30:02.800
I was at a stop sign, and he hit me!
Oh, my God!

30:03.520 --> 30:05.280
Was it a four-way stop?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.640
- What does that matter?
- I don't know.

30:07.720 --> 30:10.480
I don't know what to ask
after you've been hit by a deer.

30:11.600 --> 30:14.760
- I don't see him.
- Put salt down. Deer love salt.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.520
- Where am I gonna get salt?
- Do you have a lunch?

30:17.600 --> 30:19.080
- Lane!
- Sorry.

30:20.240 --> 30:23.080
I don't see him anywhere.
What if he's hurt?

30:23.160 --> 30:24.240
Rory, your test.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.800
- What time is it?
- It's 7:40.

30:26.840 --> 30:27.880
No!

30:45.080 --> 30:46.400
I'm sorry.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.960
Everyone back to your tests.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.640
- You've to wait in the library.
- What about the test?

30:50.720 --> 30:52.240
- You've missed the test.
- No.

30:52.320 --> 30:55.840
We start class promptly at 8:05.
That's when I need people in their seats.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.720
- Please.
- I'm sorry. It's the rules.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.520
But you don't understand.
I was up all night studying...

31:00.600 --> 31:02.840
and then I missed my bus.
So I had to drive.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.640
- Let's discuss this outside.
- So, I'm driving, and I get hit by a deer.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.200
- You hit a deer?
- No, I got hit by a deer.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.440
You don't believe me?
I've got antler prints on the car.

31:12.480 --> 31:13.520
Come on.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.320
No! You have to let me take this test!
I'm ready for it.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.440
- I know everything about Shakespeare.
- You've to calm down now.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.680
- I know his birthday, his mother's name...
- Loser.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.400
And just what is wrong with you?

31:25.480 --> 31:28.800
You already have everything.
You have the grades and the status.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.120
What's wrong with you...

31:30.200 --> 31:32.920
that you have this need
to be the biggest jerk in the world?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Let's go.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.360
What's up, quippy? Why so silent?

31:37.440 --> 31:38.880
Outside, now.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.880
And, for the last time, the name is Rory!

31:49.160 --> 31:51.880
Make sure that carpet is replaced perfectly
before they go.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.480
- Okay.
- Perfectly, nailed down and everything.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.840
You mean that "perfectly."
I thought you meant the other "perfectly."

31:57.920 --> 32:00.960
The one that could be misinterpreted
by the other Michel...

32:01.040 --> 32:04.880
the one who couldn't understand
what you meant by "perfectly."

32:07.760 --> 32:11.720
- What do you think about Pat Benatar?
- Great idea. Can she play the harp?

32:18.120 --> 32:20.560
I knew it! I found it!

32:20.640 --> 32:22.480
- You found what?
- I found his bill!

32:22.520 --> 32:23.640
What are you talking about?

32:23.720 --> 32:26.720
It wasn't the risotto, it was the wine.
He ordered the wrong wine!

32:26.800 --> 32:27.920
Great.

32:27.960 --> 32:30.520
In the review,
he mentioned a summer tomato salad...

32:30.600 --> 32:32.760
which I only made once
in the last three weeks...

32:32.840 --> 32:36.280
because Jackson decides to
get in a fistfight with his tomato grower...

32:36.360 --> 32:39.520
- Okay, that's a different story.
- Yes. Save it for Christmastime.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.600
Brian, the goateed waiter,
only worked one shift last week...

32:42.680 --> 32:44.680
because his girlfriend kicked him out.

32:44.760 --> 32:46.760
- Celia kicked him out?
- He didn't want kids.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.520
- But she knew that.
- Women think they can change men.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.640
Yeah.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.200
So, I checked the dates,
and narrowed the day down...

32:53.280 --> 32:56.600
and found a party that had ordered
practically everything including...

32:56.680 --> 33:00.320
- The magic risotto.
- Yes, the risotto and a Riesling. A Riesling!

33:00.400 --> 33:01.920
Why not drink battery acid?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.760
Exactly. Changes the entire flavor
of the dish.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.200
The fact that Brian served it...

33:06.280 --> 33:08.400
makes me think
Celia is better off without him.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.840
I'm so glad, hon.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.240
Okay. Here are the zucchini.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.360
Too small. Take them away.

33:22.840 --> 33:25.920
- It's good to have her back, huh?
- Yeah.

33:27.280 --> 33:30.040
You're still gonna have to pay
for the zucchini.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.760
There's a man with a funny accent
on the phone, asking for you.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.200
Really? Did you guys exchange
the secret handshake?

33:41.400 --> 33:42.840
Lorelai here.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.560
Rory, what happened?

33:45.640 --> 33:47.800
- I got hit by a deer.
- You got what?

33:47.920 --> 33:50.480
Then I was late,
and they wouldn't let me take the test.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.440
- What?
- They wouldn't let me take the test...

33:52.520 --> 33:54.600
- No, you're kidding me.
- Mom...

33:54.680 --> 33:58.040
No, it's okay. Just sit right here.
I'll handle this.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.840
Excuse me. Hello.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.280
- Ms. Gilmore. Please come in.
- Thank you.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.440
Have a seat.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.080
I think there's been a terrible mistake.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.960
Rory told me that
she wasn't allowed to take her test.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.400
- She was late.
- Right, well...

34:20.480 --> 34:22.719
see, there were circumstances
beyond her control.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.679
Rory is never late.
She's almost annoyingly on time.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.960
If you checked your records...

34:27.040 --> 34:30.239
Past performance has nothing to do
with today's situation.

34:30.360 --> 34:33.320
Okay. But see,
she was up all night studying.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.120
I was there. She has a witness.

34:35.199 --> 34:38.280
- She's not on trial here.
- Well, Your Honor...

34:39.639 --> 34:42.520
Just a little trial humor.
That won't happen again.

34:42.560 --> 34:45.120
She got up late.
She broke her neck to get here.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.600
We don't live locally as you...

34:46.679 --> 34:48.800
- "The dog ate my homework."
- Excuse me?

34:48.880 --> 34:51.159
"My computer crashed,
and I lost my midterm."

34:51.199 --> 34:52.440
I wasn't making excuses.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.400
"My grandmother and first cousin died."

34:54.480 --> 34:57.080
"My sister took my report to school
instead of hers."

34:57.160 --> 34:59.800
"My religion prohibits studying
after sundown."

34:59.880 --> 35:02.680
"I went blind last night, but I'm fine now."

35:02.880 --> 35:04.240
That's not Rory.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.240
Rules are rules.

35:07.320 --> 35:10.880
When you're late,
you forfeit the right to take the test.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.680
Where are you going? Where is he going?

35:13.760 --> 35:16.360
Please, believe me,
if I could do anything, I would.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.520
- You could let her take the test.
- I can"t.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.680
That's not fair.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.360
We're not here to be fair.
We're here to educate.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.560
Yes, and I'm asking you
to please educate my kid.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.760
We will when she's on time.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.280
Have a nice day.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.520
Are you holding that door open
for a reason?

35:32.600 --> 35:34.560
- Our meeting is over.
- Like hell it is.

35:35.640 --> 35:39.200
Do you have any idea
what we have gone through this week?

35:39.320 --> 35:42.880
We have been up all night every night,
studying. We haven't slept.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.680
We haven't talked about anything else...

35:44.760 --> 35:47.320
except this school and this test
for seven days.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.520
We have stretched ourselves
as thin as humanly possible...

35:50.560 --> 35:54.160
without going completely postal.
My God! We're just one person!

35:54.240 --> 35:57.320
Why don't we narrow
our field of conversation down to Rory?

35:57.400 --> 35:58.720
Okay. Why don't we?

35:58.800 --> 36:00.840
You sit here in your snotty little school...

36:00.920 --> 36:03.000
in desperate need
of some extra heating vents...

36:03.080 --> 36:06.440
and you nurture horrible kids
who treat each other like mortal enemies.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.120
You set impossible standards...

36:08.200 --> 36:10.640
that make normal people
feel less than everybody else.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.320
You take a great kid like Rory
and tear her apart!

36:13.400 --> 36:15.080
I don't think that's completely fair.

36:15.160 --> 36:17.280
You say she's smart and she'll do fine.

36:17.320 --> 36:20.640
And this rotting, stodgy rathole
could use somebody like her.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.920
Then you completely shut her out of a test
that she's crammed for...

36:24.000 --> 36:25.640
that she completely deserves to take!

36:25.720 --> 36:28.840
- I didn't call this place a rathole.
- That's true. I added that.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.480
Wouldn't want you to get
in trouble with II Duce here.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.680
I thought this place
was gonna be so great.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.680
And now, I guess this goes on
the "Boy, was I wrong" list...

36:36.760 --> 36:39.720
right above gauchos
but just below the Flashdance phase.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.360
My goodness,
you do like to throw fits in your family.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.600
What are you talking about?

36:43.680 --> 36:47.560
Your daughter threw a similar, if not
as manic, fit of her own this morning.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.960
Please. Rory doesn't throw fits.

36:50.240 --> 36:52.600
She's the most even-tempered person
I know.

36:52.680 --> 36:54.960
Well, she did a lovely impression of you.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.680
Everything you said in your rant
was absolutely true...

36:58.760 --> 37:01.320
without the colorful embellishments
of course.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.560
We do set impossible standards...

37:03.640 --> 37:06.440
and such standards do foster
highly competitive children.

37:06.520 --> 37:09.880
However, that is life, and that is Chilton.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.400
Rules can change. You can change them.

37:12.480 --> 37:16.040
I told your daughter when she came here,
this place was not for everyone...

37:16.080 --> 37:19.440
and might not be for her.
I will now tell you the same thing.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.320
She doesn't have to be here.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.480
She doesn't have to go to Harvard.
Maybe she shouldn"t.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.640
If she can't handle the pressure,
she should leave.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.800
You need to take your daughter home now
and decide what it is you intend to do.

37:31.880 --> 37:35.440
However, another outburst like this
from either of you...

37:35.520 --> 37:37.800
will not be on the options list.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.840
Thank you for coming in.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.200
That will be all.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.440
You got hit by a deer?

37:55.040 --> 37:57.720
You did. You got hit by a deer.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.760
It just came out of nowhere.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.320
You couldn't just run into a wall
like other kids?

38:02.400 --> 38:05.680
- Can we just go home, please?
- Yeah, sure. Jump in.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.640
- May I help you?
- Yes.

38:18.640 --> 38:22.280
Hello. My name is Sookie St. James.
I'm the chef at the Independence Inn.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.960
- I know who you are.
- You do?

38:25.760 --> 38:29.240
Well, I'm flattered.
You write about a lot of chefs...

38:29.320 --> 38:31.360
- What are you doing here?
- Right.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.920
I know that this
is a terrible intrusion, but...

38:35.160 --> 38:37.720
- Are you cooking?
- I'm making chicken.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.920
- You used too much salt.
- I did not.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.200
It smells salty.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.160
- I'm closing the door now.
- No, wait.

38:43.200 --> 38:46.040
I found your address
from my network of culinary friends...

38:46.120 --> 38:49.480
This is really inappropriate.
I gave you a good review.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.280
I suggest you go home.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.760
I don't care about the review. I just...

38:53.840 --> 38:56.280
I want you to try this dish...

38:57.640 --> 38:59.160
with this wine.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.480
I'll wait.

39:06.960 --> 39:10.760
- Quite a day, huh?
- I don't want to talk. Please.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.560
Okay.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.520
I just think we should talk about it.

39:15.600 --> 39:16.760
- Stop the car.
- What?

39:16.840 --> 39:18.440
Here. Stop here.

39:19.280 --> 39:21.760
You're just feeling like
an impromptu nature walk?

39:21.840 --> 39:23.040
I wanna see if it's all right.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.320
- Lf what's all right?
- The deer.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.240
- You're never gonna find the deer!
- I'm gonna try.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.320
- I'm in heels.
- Stay in the car.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.320
It's dangerous in the car
with the kamikaze deer running around.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.080
I have to find it.

39:35.200 --> 39:37.080
All right. Wait up!

39:38.200 --> 39:40.040
So what does the deer look like?

39:40.120 --> 39:42.160
Does he have any distinguishing marks...

39:42.240 --> 39:44.920
besides the word "jeep"
imprinted on his forehead?

39:44.960 --> 39:46.600
He's just a deer.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.400
So I had a nice chat
with Headmaster Charleston today.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.000
He said you went ballistic in class.

39:55.080 --> 39:56.720
I was just tired.

39:56.920 --> 40:00.360
You wouldn't have been tired
had you not been killing yourself all week.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.240
I was studying. I didn't have a choice.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.520
Maybe you shouldn't be studying
that hard.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.960
- What are you talking about?
- You're 16.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.560
You should get some sleep
and eat a real meal...

40:09.640 --> 40:11.840
and come up for air once in a while.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.280
They kicked me out.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.880
No. Of course not.
They love you. This is coming from me.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.520
Are you saying I should quit?

40:18.560 --> 40:21.840
I'm saying, if you wanted to go back
to your other school with Lane...

40:21.920 --> 40:23.800
that would be fine with me.

40:23.840 --> 40:26.480
- You don't think I can do it.
- You know that's not true.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.360
I think you can do anything.
But you don't lose it in class.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.920
That's not part of
the Rory personality description.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.520
If you're losing it in class...

40:33.600 --> 40:36.240
because you're tired, stressed out,
or working too hard...

40:36.280 --> 40:38.880
I'm worried about that. I have to be.

40:39.120 --> 40:42.560
- I lost it once.
- Okay. Fine.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.480
It's just I can't remember a time...

40:48.560 --> 40:51.320
when we weren't talking about
you going to Harvard.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.040
It was just a given.
That was what we were working for.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.880
- Everything went in that direction.
- I know.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.800
And I'm forgetting where that all started.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.640
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about...

41:02.720 --> 41:04.920
did it start with me
or did it start with you?

41:05.000 --> 41:07.240
Was it my dream
that you went to Harvard?

41:07.280 --> 41:08.280
Mom.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.840
Because I never got to do
the big, fancy college thing.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.920
Maybe all this time I'm thinking
it's all for Rory...

41:15.000 --> 41:16.880
when really it wasn"t.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.680
- I'm not doing this because of you.
- Lf you are, you don't have to.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.720
- I know that.
- I'll still love you...

41:22.760 --> 41:24.720
even if you can't support me
in my old age...

41:24.760 --> 41:27.600
in the fabulous manner
to which I plan on growing accustomed.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.840
I'll remember that selfless gesture.
Thank you.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.320
- I just want you to be happy.
- I am.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.720
No, I want you to be...

41:34.800 --> 41:37.760
dancing-through-the-woods-crazy happy.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.480
If Harvard and Chilton
is not gonna do that for you...

41:40.560 --> 41:41.920
then forget about them.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.400
I was just behind.

41:43.520 --> 41:47.320
I never caught up on all the reading.
That's why I got a "D."

41:47.680 --> 41:51.680
I can catch up. I will catch up.
And when I do, everything will be fine.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.360
No. Harvard is my dream.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.920
- I want it more than anything. I swear.
- Yeah, but...

41:58.960 --> 42:01.800
I appreciate all that you're saying. I do.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.800
But I'm not ready to
give up on Chilton yet.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.120
Fair enough.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.560
I do, however,
reserve the right to change my mind.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.160
That's your prerogative,
as long as you remain a woman.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.960
- Thanks, though.
- For what?

42:17.240 --> 42:19.520
For yelling at the headmaster
the way you did.

42:19.600 --> 42:21.600
I didn't yell at him.

42:21.760 --> 42:23.400
You called him II Duce.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.520
Which means "kind sir" in Cantonese.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:30.360 --> 42:33.160
How much longer are we gonna
look for this crazy deer?

42:33.200 --> 42:34.800
Just a little further.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.920
- I just hope he didn't hurt himself.
- I just hope he has insurance.

42:40.480 --> 42:43.400
Go get that plaid skirt off
and grab your books.

42:43.440 --> 42:44.760
We're going to Luke"s.

42:44.840 --> 42:48.600
- Don't you have to get back to work?
- They can last a little longer without me.

42:48.680 --> 42:51.120
Plus Michel gets so cute
when he feels he's overworked.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.480
His ears puff out, his nostrils flare.
It's big fun.

42:53.520 --> 42:55.040
- Go.
- I'm gone.

43:00.200 --> 43:03.560
It's us. We're not here.
We have a life. Get over it.

43:04.240 --> 43:07.760
Hi. This is a message for Rory.
It's Max Medina calling.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.680
I just wanted to say
I talked to Headmaster Charleston...

43:10.760 --> 43:14.600
or II Duce, as he's more affectionately
known in the Gilmore household...

43:14.680 --> 43:17.160
and he's agreed to let you do
some extra credit work...

43:17.240 --> 43:19.480
to help make up for the missed test today.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.400
Now, I'm not sure
what the extra credit work is yet...

43:22.480 --> 43:26.280
but it probably will be time-consuming
and extremely painful.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.840
It will, however, get you back up to
where I think you rightly belong, Rory.

43:31.120 --> 43:33.520
Don't lose heart. Make this work.

43:34.440 --> 43:36.320
And if your mother's listening...

43:36.360 --> 43:39.160
Lorelai, it was a pleasure
encountering you.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.200
I hope it happens again.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.680
Anyway, see you in class. Bye.
