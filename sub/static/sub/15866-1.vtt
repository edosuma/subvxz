01:59.419 --> 02:00.852
I can tell you like it.

02:00.987 --> 02:01.976
Oh.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.350
I love it.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.479
It's perfect.

02:04.624 --> 02:05.613
Well, great.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.191
It really is such a neat place.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.952
You know, I showed it
to another girl this morning.

02:11.097 --> 02:13.190
But to be honest,
I didn't like her very much.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.664
She looks like trouble,

02:14.801 --> 02:18.760
and I'm way too old to be
dealing with all that nonsense.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.171
I go a lot on my gut feelings,
and I have a good one about you.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.208
You remind me of my daughter.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.141
Oh, thank you.

02:26.279 --> 02:29.180
It's just what
I've been looking for.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.304
Well, great.

02:30.450 --> 02:36.286
Welcome to your new home.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.732
I'll get things moving
on your application,

02:50.870 --> 02:55.034
and we'll have you set up here
in no time.

02:55.175 --> 02:59.544
Um, about the deposit, um....

02:59.679 --> 03:01.146
Okay, I'll tell you what.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.647
If it'll help you out,
and I imagine it would,

03:03.750 --> 03:05.809
I'll agree to waive
all of the deposit stuff.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.716
You just give me
the first month's down.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.014
We'll call it a day, all right?

03:09.155 --> 03:10.144
Really?

03:10.256 --> 03:11.587
That would be incredible.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.022
Well, I remember when
my daughter was looking

03:14.160 --> 03:15.525
for her first apartment.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.562
It's hard coming up
with all that money, isn't it?

03:17.697 --> 03:18.721
You just promise me

03:18.865 --> 03:21.231
that you are gonna take
good care of this place.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.391
I promise.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.230
Besides,
you'll be a good tenant.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.769
I always trust my gut.

03:25.905 --> 03:28.169
Well, you won't regret it.
I swear.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.765
Oh, you know,
I have some things

03:30.910 --> 03:33.743
I have to still take care of
with the gal that lives here.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.404
You just get me the check
by Monday.

03:35.548 --> 03:36.879
I'll have you in by the end
of the week,

03:37.016 --> 03:38.347
if that's okay with you.

03:38.451 --> 03:39.440
I can do whatever.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.575
Good.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.778
Thank you so much.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.513
You bet, sweetie.
Bye-bye.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.225
Heather, come on.

07:08.327 --> 07:11.387
It's morning.

08:27.073 --> 08:29.234
Please leave a message
after the beep.

08:30.877 --> 08:32.366
Hi.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.570
This is Samantha Hughes.

08:33.712 --> 08:36.682
I'm calling in regards
to the babysitter flyer

08:36.816 --> 08:39.683
posted outside my dorm.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.376
I hope this is the right number.

08:41.520 --> 08:46.049
If it is, you can reach me
at 815-1920.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.659
I'm very interested.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.887
Thank you.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.123
Hello?

09:27.266 --> 09:28.563
Samantha.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.225
Yes?

09:30.369 --> 09:34.738
You just left me a message
about the babysitting position.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.604
Oh, yeah, I did.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.643
How did you get this number?

09:39.779 --> 09:43.408
Please excuse the urgency,
but if you're still interested,

09:43.549 --> 09:45.278
I would like to meet you.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.478
Sure.
That would be fine.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.248
Well, I'm afraid
I'm not too familiar

09:50.389 --> 09:51.447
with the layout over there.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.580
Perhaps you could meet me

09:52.725 --> 09:55.159
in front
of the Student Affairs office?

09:55.294 --> 09:57.558
That's where I dropped off
my advertisements.

09:57.663 --> 10:00.131
Okay, I know where that is.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.460
Wonderful.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.262
I'll see you there.

10:03.402 --> 10:07.668
Right now?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.672
Hello?

11:13.639 --> 11:15.402
Psst.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.070
All right, everyone.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.103
Have a great holiday.
I'll see you guys next year.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.109
Whoo-hoo.
Whoo.

13:39.852 --> 13:41.877
So tell me all about it.

13:42.021 --> 13:45.650
I want details.

13:45.791 --> 13:48.055
Well, it's not too big.

13:48.194 --> 13:49.491
When you walk in,

13:49.628 --> 13:52.620
there's, like, a little
living room area on the left

13:52.731 --> 13:53.959
and then a hallway
down the right.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.363
Oh, it is carpet or hardwood?

13:55.501 --> 13:56.525
Hardwood.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.658
Good.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.168
Carpet's filth,

13:59.305 --> 14:01.705
especially for a germaphobe
like you.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.139
I'm not a germaphobe.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.369
What?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.878
I don't like gross things.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.982
Anyway,
the kitchen's kind of blah,

14:11.083 --> 14:12.175
and so is the bathroom.

14:12.318 --> 14:14.718
But I'll paint them cool colors
or something.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.843
Yeah.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.388
Oh.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.684
I wish you had pictures.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.019
Yeah, me too.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.855
I'm sort of sucking
at explaining it right now.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.190
But you'll see it soon.

14:25.331 --> 14:28.164
Yeah, well, it sounds great.

14:29.702 --> 14:34.036
Mm.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.698
This pizza is nasty today.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.400
Gross.

14:38.544 --> 14:41.240
Ugh.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.439
Megan, how am I gonna afford
all this stuff?

14:43.582 --> 14:45.709
I'm-
You're gonna be fine.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.614
It's gonna work out.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.015
That's easy for you to say.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.055
You're not the one
with $84 in her bank account

14:51.190 --> 14:52.589
and a check to write on Monday.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.091
Yeah, but just relax.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.717
It's Wednesday.

14:56.862 --> 14:59.353
You know, if it's a big problem,
I can always call my dad.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.863
No, don't do that.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.733
No, look, he really
doesn't care at all.

15:06.872 --> 15:09.306
Look, I'm not saying
it's gonna get to that point,

15:09.441 --> 15:11.875
but if it does,
you're never gonna be homeless.

15:11.977 --> 15:13.638
Yeah?

15:16.715 --> 15:17.909
It's so weird and annoying

15:18.050 --> 15:19.642
the way that guy
stood you up today.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.652
I know.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.312
You're gonna find something.

15:24.456 --> 15:25.718
Okay?

15:25.824 --> 15:31.160
Did you go to the job board
at the intern office?

15:31.297 --> 15:32.286
That ham-faced girl,

15:32.431 --> 15:33.762
you know, in my class?

15:33.899 --> 15:37.426
Yeah, she said there's
good stuff there sometimes.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.763
No, I haven't been yet.

15:38.904 --> 15:39.928
Although it would be cool

15:40.072 --> 15:41.596
to get something easy
and under the table.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.970
That's what was so good
about the babysitter thing.

15:45.144 --> 15:46.805
Yeah, but it
could have been awful.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.935
You know?

15:48.080 --> 15:49.240
The kid could be from hell.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.942
You don't even like kids anyway.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.915
Yeah, I guess.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.689
You know what you should do?

15:58.824 --> 16:00.621
You should go around campus

16:00.759 --> 16:04.422
and rip down all of the other
posters he put up,

16:04.530 --> 16:05.758
and then nobody else calls him.

16:05.864 --> 16:06.922
How do you like them apples?

16:07.032 --> 16:08.294
That's good payback, right?

16:08.434 --> 16:09.423
Nah.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.593
What?

16:10.703 --> 16:11.795
It's genius,

16:11.937 --> 16:14.804
because then nobody else
will show up.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.033
No, I just want to forget it.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.165
No more drama.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.973
All right, then.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.304
You want to go?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.111
Yeah.

18:50.662 --> 18:53.096
Get a grip.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.649
What the hell time is it?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.784
Night.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.285
Oh, shit.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.720
Where's your friend?

19:27.666 --> 19:29.293
Who cares?

19:32.471 --> 19:34.996
Ugh.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.144
Someone called for you.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.736
Who?

19:42.881 --> 19:44.405
I don't know.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.986
Some dude, some guy.

19:48.086 --> 19:51.487
I left his number on your desk.

19:57.496 --> 20:00.363
Where?
Where did you put it?

20:00.499 --> 20:02.023
Chill out.
It's there.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.725
I just-

20:03.869 --> 20:04.858
I don't know.

20:05.003 --> 20:09.167
By your pens, maybe.

20:09.274 --> 20:12.175
When was this?

20:20.185 --> 20:22.415
Please leave a message
after the beep.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.554
Hello, this is
Samantha Hughes again.

20:26.692 --> 20:29.957
I got a message that you called.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.119
Samantha?

20:31.263 --> 20:33.390
Yes?

20:33.532 --> 20:35.363
Oh, thank goodness you called.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.560
Quite frankly,
I didn't think you would.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.965
I'm so sorry about this morning.

20:39.104 --> 20:40.366
Things were very hectic for me,

20:40.472 --> 20:42.963
and I got caught up in lots
of last-minute details.

20:43.108 --> 20:44.939
It was a bit of a catastrophe.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.568
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.374
I spoke with another girl
this morning

20:49.481 --> 20:50.743
who I thought was going
to work out,

20:50.882 --> 20:54.045
but she turned out to be
totally unreliable.

20:54.152 --> 20:55.642
And while I can
certainly understand

20:55.787 --> 20:58.483
you being upset with me,
I must be honest,

20:58.624 --> 21:00.455
I'm in dire need of someone.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.253
You mean tonight?

21:02.394 --> 21:03.918
Yes.

21:04.062 --> 21:05.154
It's very important.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.764
Um-

21:06.898 --> 21:09.332
I will pay you double
what I would have normally.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.402
That's $100.

21:11.503 --> 21:12.765
It's very simple.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.168
It wouldn't take even
much of your time.

21:15.307 --> 21:19.334
We would be home soon
after midnight.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.467
Are you there?

21:20.612 --> 21:25.140
Yes, um...

21:25.284 --> 21:26.273
Okay.

21:26.418 --> 21:27.407
I think I can do it.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.612
Oh, thank goodness.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.017
You're saving me.

21:31.156 --> 21:33.420
And I promise to make this
as painless for you as possible.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.514
That's okay.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.957
I can always use the money.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.288
Of course.

21:37.429 --> 21:41.422
Let me give you the address.

22:11.530 --> 22:13.691
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:13.832 --> 22:14.856
Thanks for the ride.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.127
I'm just your monkey
with a cigarette.

22:17.235 --> 22:18.224
Okay.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.709
The whole kit and caboodle
kicks off tonight

22:33.852 --> 22:35.183
just after 10:30.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.753
I know it's late
for some of you folks,

22:36.888 --> 22:37.877
but stay up.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.251
It's worth it.

22:39.391 --> 22:41.655
Be sure to find a good spot
where you can see the sky.

22:43.528 --> 22:44.756
Ugh.

22:44.896 --> 22:48.491
I'm so sick of hearing
about that stupid eclipse.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.398
It's, like, all anybody
can ever talk about.

22:51.536 --> 22:53.026
They're like, "Oh, gosh.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.731
"Are you gonna go see
the eclipse tonight? Buh."

22:57.042 --> 22:59.010
Oh, God.

22:59.111 --> 23:02.342
You know, it's not like
the moon's gonna explode.

23:02.447 --> 23:06.110
Although that would be
pretty cool.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.686
So do you want me
to come with you?

23:10.789 --> 23:12.757
I don't have to see
Mark tonight.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.791
He hates me anyway.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.587
No, it's okay.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.754
But I feel a little weird,
you know,

23:19.898 --> 23:22.799
just dropping you out here
in, like,

23:22.934 --> 23:28.804
in the middle of Jabib
or wherever we are.

23:28.940 --> 23:32.068
I mean, I had to look at a map.

23:32.210 --> 23:33.199
Well, don't worry.

23:33.311 --> 23:34.300
I'm gonna be fine.

23:34.446 --> 23:35.538
Okay.

23:35.647 --> 23:39.606
Okay, but I have
to tell you something.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.777
But you got to promise that
you're not gonna get mad at me.

23:42.921 --> 23:43.910
What?

23:44.055 --> 23:45.420
All right,
you can't get mad at me.

23:45.557 --> 23:46.546
You got to promise.

23:46.658 --> 23:48.489
- No.
- No-

23:48.627 --> 23:49.924
I don't even know
what it is yet.

23:50.061 --> 23:54.054
God-okay.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.298
Where did you get these?

24:00.439 --> 24:01.463
I'm sorry.

24:01.606 --> 24:03.130
You were upset, and I felt bad.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.264
Megan.

24:04.409 --> 24:05.433
I know, I know.

24:05.577 --> 24:06.566
I'm sorry.

24:06.678 --> 24:07.770
But look, like,

24:07.913 --> 24:09.505
it was-it was like,

24:09.648 --> 24:11.240
he was such a jerk
for standing you up.

24:11.349 --> 24:12.407
Yes, he was.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.109
And you were super bummed out.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.241
You were.

24:15.353 --> 24:17.685
And, like, we had
a really good idea.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.290
And I know that you
weren't gonna do it,

24:19.424 --> 24:20.482
so I had to do it, man.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.024
And I didn't know
he was gonna call you.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.149
How could I have known that?

24:23.295 --> 24:26.128
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

24:26.264 --> 24:29.859
Well, now I know why
I got the job.

24:30.001 --> 24:31.832
Nobody else called.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.131
Just please let me
stay with you.

24:34.272 --> 24:35.830
Please let me stay with you.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.771
I will be so good.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.367
I won't touch anything
or eat their food.

24:40.512 --> 24:41.501
I won't take your money.

24:41.646 --> 24:42.635
I just-well, I'll be there,

24:42.781 --> 24:43.873
and we'll, like, hang out.

24:44.015 --> 24:46.779
All right, okay.
I heard you the first 50 times.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.876
Can I come, then?

24:49.020 --> 24:50.851
Let's just wait
and see how it goes.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.854
They could be nice.
You don't know.

24:52.991 --> 24:54.117
No, I do know.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.989
Normal people do not pull
the kind of stuff

24:56.127 --> 24:57.617
that those people
pulled with you today.

24:57.729 --> 24:58.787
They just don't.

24:58.897 --> 25:00.023
Look who's talking.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.723
That's different.

25:01.867 --> 25:04.028
People make mistakes.
It happens.

25:05.370 --> 25:06.394
I mean, hey, they live

25:06.538 --> 25:07.527
all the way out here
in the country.

25:07.672 --> 25:08.832
So they're at least
normal enough

25:08.974 --> 25:10.168
to have real jobs
that pay tons of money.

25:10.308 --> 25:13.209
You think having lots of money
makes you normal?

25:13.345 --> 25:17.714
You've clearly never met
my family.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.409
Well, we'll see.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.654
Yes, we will.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.532
Hey, yo, check it.

26:09.634 --> 26:12.432
Volvo.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.096
Safest car on the road.

26:23.214 --> 26:26.206
Holy crap.

26:55.447 --> 26:56.505
Hi.

26:56.648 --> 27:03.417
I'm Samantha,
the babysitter.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.251
This is my friend, Megan.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.916
Vincent Ulman.

27:08.026 --> 27:11.621
Very nice to meet you both.

27:11.763 --> 27:13.822
Such beautiful girls.

27:15.200 --> 27:20.467
Please come inside.

27:46.231 --> 27:49.223
Have a seat.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.170
You're a doll for agreeing
to this.

27:56.307 --> 27:57.535
I mean it.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.644
Oh, it's nothing, really.

27:59.744 --> 28:02.076
I can't tell you how much
of a relief it'll be

28:02.213 --> 28:03.703
to get this night behind us.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.749
You know, we only arrived
in town very recently,

28:06.885 --> 28:08.910
and we really haven't had
a moment to spare,

28:09.054 --> 28:12.683
you know, what with the eclipse
and all.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.918
So are you a teacher
or something?

28:16.061 --> 28:17.722
No.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.557
I mean, not exactly.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.926
Just-did you know
both of you live

28:21.066 --> 28:23.398
in one of the most perfect
places on Earth

28:23.535 --> 28:25.025
to get a clear view
of it tonight?

28:25.170 --> 28:29.072
We heard.

28:29.207 --> 28:32.574
Yeah, this place is quite
the astronomer's dream.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.043
Are you an astronomer?

28:35.180 --> 28:38.115
No, not exactly.

28:38.249 --> 28:40.046
Samantha, could I have
a word with you

28:40.185 --> 28:45.248
in the other room, please?

28:45.390 --> 28:48.382
Um... sure.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.486
I hope you don't have
a problem,

29:16.621 --> 29:19.488
but you have to understand
that I am only paying one person

29:19.624 --> 29:20.648
for their time.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.783
Oh, yeah.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.588
No, Megan's not staying.

29:24.729 --> 29:26.060
She's just my ride.

29:26.164 --> 29:30.567
I don't have a car,
so she was just dropping me off.

29:30.668 --> 29:31.828
Oh, good.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.332
And please forgive me
for sounding rude.

29:35.473 --> 29:40.433
It's just that my wife
is very on edge

29:40.578 --> 29:43.672
about this whole situation.

29:43.815 --> 29:44.839
You're not being rude.

29:44.983 --> 29:48.783
I understand.

29:48.920 --> 29:52.014
Unfortunately, no,
I'm afraid you don't.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.852
Excuse me?

29:53.992 --> 29:56.460
Please sit down.

31:03.161 --> 31:04.355
You have to forgive me,
Samantha,

31:04.495 --> 31:08.431
because I've not been
completely honest.

31:08.566 --> 31:12.024
You see,
we actually don't have a child.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.204
We have a child, but he's grown.

31:16.341 --> 31:19.538
This job tonight
is not for a child

31:19.677 --> 31:21.338
but for my wife's mother.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.081
Oh.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.204
Hear me out.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.080
Mr. Ulman, um,

31:28.219 --> 31:30.551
I don't have any experience
with anything like that.

31:30.688 --> 31:32.178
I think maybe you should find-

31:34.893 --> 31:36.053
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.185
I didn't mean to-

31:40.531 --> 31:43.193
Listen, this is not anything
like you're imagining.

31:43.301 --> 31:44.734
There's nothing medical

31:44.869 --> 31:46.200
that you would
have to do whatsoever.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.932
In fact, you don't have to do
much of anything and...

31:50.241 --> 31:51.640
I find this all a bit awkward.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.971
But you have to understand
I have only the best intentions.

31:54.112 --> 31:56.273
I've been putting advertisements
out for the past two weeks

31:56.414 --> 31:57.472
to get someone for tonight.

31:57.615 --> 31:59.207
But nobody responds
to elderly assistants

31:59.317 --> 32:00.750
or home care anymore.

32:00.885 --> 32:06.721
So I thought maybe "babysitter"
would get a better response.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.314
But to be honest,
it didn't do much.

32:08.459 --> 32:11.326
And like I said on the phone,
I only got one other girl.

32:11.462 --> 32:15.899
And when I told her the truth,
she backed out, so...

32:16.000 --> 32:19.401
I mean, I figure
it's all the horror stories

32:19.504 --> 32:22.064
that you read in the paper
and see on TV

32:22.173 --> 32:25.939
that have scared away
girls of your age

32:26.077 --> 32:29.672
from these types
of opportunities.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.647
Yeah, there's a lot
of weirdoes out there.

32:34.352 --> 32:37.150
You're right.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.188
And I sincerely apologize
for being dishonest,

32:39.324 --> 32:41.019
but what I'm asking of you
is not that different

32:41.159 --> 32:42.319
than what you expected.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.361
It's essentially
just like babysitting.

32:46.431 --> 32:47.420
I'm sorry.

32:47.532 --> 32:48.624
I appreciate your situation.

32:48.766 --> 32:49.790
I do.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.526
Okay, what will it take?

32:56.841 --> 33:02.040
How about if I gave you
another $100?

33:05.450 --> 33:08.544
Okay, okay.

33:08.686 --> 33:10.950
$200.

33:11.055 --> 33:13.489
That's $300 for one night.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.649
Please.

33:15.793 --> 33:17.283
You have no idea
how important this is.

33:20.331 --> 33:23.323
$400.

33:31.809 --> 33:34.004
Hey.

33:34.145 --> 33:35.976
Megan.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.069
Jeez, come on.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.204
Hold on.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.373
Megan.

33:39.517 --> 33:40.506
Come on, wait a second.

33:40.651 --> 33:42.346
Are you out of your mind?

33:42.487 --> 33:43.681
Do you remember the game plan?

33:43.821 --> 33:45.482
The game plan was,
if they're weird, we leave.

33:45.590 --> 33:46.989
This is beyond weird.
It's mental.

33:47.091 --> 33:49.218
You know, they lied to you.
They lied to you.

33:49.360 --> 33:50.657
- I know, okay.
- They're liars.

33:50.762 --> 33:51.820
I know you're right.

33:51.929 --> 33:53.055
But it's $400.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.758
It's $400 for four hours.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.528
This equals first month's rent
and then some,

33:58.669 --> 34:00.694
and all I have to do
is sit inside and watch TV.

34:00.838 --> 34:01.896
It's too good to be true.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.203
Did you ever think
it is too good to be true?

34:05.343 --> 34:06.435
Megan, please.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.373
I need the money.

34:08.513 --> 34:12.882
It's so stupid.

34:13.016 --> 34:15.713
Ugh.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.616
I'm so mad at you.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.723
Look, you're being
a great friend right now.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.085
But this is huge.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.193
This one night changes
everything for me.

34:24.695 --> 34:25.753
Come on.
It's only a few hours.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.387
That's it.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.693
Just promise me you'll be here
by 12:30, and then it's over.

34:29.801 --> 34:30.790
Just promise me.

34:30.935 --> 34:33.699
Okay, fine, fine.

34:33.804 --> 34:34.793
12:30, right?

34:34.938 --> 34:36.634
Okay, yeah.

35:21.018 --> 35:22.645
Oh, God, Sam.

35:22.787 --> 35:25.779
You can be such
a fucking idiot sometimes.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.345
Oh, my God!

35:58.489 --> 36:00.047
Oh, my God.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.658
Oh, my gosh,
you scared the crap out of me.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.350
Take it easy.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.483
I'm sorry.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.153
I didn't mean to scare you.

36:06.297 --> 36:09.198
I just thought you could use
a light, is all.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.198
So sue me for being helpful.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.666
I almost just died.

36:12.803 --> 36:13.861
Oh, my God.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.632
I almost just had a heart attack
and died.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.834
Here.
You do it.

36:18.976 --> 36:20.307
It's safer.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.672
Thanks.

36:30.254 --> 36:33.485
All better?

36:33.591 --> 36:36.583
Aces.

36:38.996 --> 36:42.830
It's freezing out here.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.926
Okay.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.836
Where the hell
did you come from?

36:49.941 --> 36:52.501
Did you just hide?

36:54.345 --> 36:57.246
Are you-are you not
the babysitter?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.372
No, I'm not the babysitter.
My friend-

37:39.590 --> 37:41.615
See, here we are.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.659
Half your payment in advance

37:43.794 --> 37:45.728
just to ease your mind.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.798
And here's a little more
to get something to eat.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.263
There's a number
on the refrigerator

37:49.400 --> 37:50.890
for a pizza place.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.402
I know you college kids
love pizza.

37:53.504 --> 37:54.971
Mom is asleep,
and as I said before,

37:55.106 --> 37:57.074
there's really no need
for concern.

37:57.174 --> 38:00.473
She's old, but she's actually
quite able-bodied,

38:00.611 --> 38:03.739
actually
more able-bodied than...

38:03.848 --> 38:04.837
than myself, I hate to say.

38:04.982 --> 38:06.574
But if she needs anything,

38:06.684 --> 38:07.776
she'll be able to get it
herself.

38:07.918 --> 38:08.976
She's quite independent.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.417
Most likely,
you won't even see her.

38:10.521 --> 38:11.783
But you need to be alert

38:11.922 --> 38:14.288
just in the off chance
that there's an emergency.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.414
You understand.

38:15.526 --> 38:16.754
Mm-hmm.

38:16.861 --> 38:18.590
I mean, this is mostly
for my wife's benefit.

38:18.696 --> 38:20.755
She's, you know,
the paranoid type.

38:20.865 --> 38:21.923
But you get it.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.160
It all sounds easy enough
to handle.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.291
Terrific.

38:25.436 --> 38:26.425
Oh, right.

38:26.537 --> 38:29.199
There's-

38:29.340 --> 38:31.308
It's the number where we'll be

38:31.442 --> 38:32.636
just in case you need us.

38:32.777 --> 38:35.803
Oh, yeah, there's a number
on fridge for pizz-

38:35.946 --> 38:37.538
I already said that, didn't I?

38:38.549 --> 38:39.607
Yeah.

38:39.717 --> 38:40.775
If this wasn't screwed on...

38:40.885 --> 38:43.285
but I've said too much as it is,

38:43.387 --> 38:46.356
so I'm gonna get upstairs
and get the missus.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.891
And you just make yourself
comfortable.

38:50.027 --> 38:52.791
And I'll be back in two shakes
of a lamb's tail.

38:52.897 --> 38:55.889
Okay, thanks.

39:17.254 --> 39:21.554
I've done everything
you asked.

39:21.692 --> 39:25.423
Well, there's not going to be
any more mistakes.

39:25.563 --> 39:27.895
No, this one, she's perfect.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.226
We're not missing anything.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.235
After tonight, everything
will finally be complete.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.931
Please stop worrying.

39:36.073 --> 39:40.737
I have it all under control.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.098
Are you here for Mother?

40:02.233 --> 40:04.701
Yes, yes, I am.

40:04.802 --> 40:07.794
Wonderful.

40:10.975 --> 40:12.636
You're a godsend.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.745
It's nothing.

40:14.879 --> 40:18.747
Not to us, it's not.

40:18.883 --> 40:19.975
Well, I'm glad to do it.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.717
Hmm.

40:25.656 --> 40:26.816
Vivian Ulman.

40:26.957 --> 40:27.946
Samantha.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.081
Sam.

40:29.226 --> 40:31.956
Nice to meet you.

40:32.963 --> 40:34.430
What's the matter, Sam?

40:34.565 --> 40:36.157
Oh, nothing.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.494
I just-

40:37.635 --> 40:40.661
I thought your husband
went upstairs looking for you,

40:40.805 --> 40:43.569
and I didn't expect to see you
come in from over there.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.609
I just-I get disoriented
sometimes.

40:46.744 --> 40:50.578
My friend Megan says
I'm out to lunch.

40:50.681 --> 40:51.909
I was downstairs
in the basement

40:52.016 --> 40:53.176
looking for my furs.

40:53.317 --> 40:56.343
I just can't get used
to this cold weather.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.648
I love the heat.

40:58.789 --> 41:00.347
We're from the desert, you know.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.480
Oh?

41:01.625 --> 41:02.614
Mm-hmm.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.421
What about you?

41:04.528 --> 41:06.086
Is this your home?

41:06.197 --> 41:07.687
Yeah.

41:07.832 --> 41:10.266
Well, it's more downstate,
but it's pretty much the same.

41:10.367 --> 41:12.927
I don't like the cold
much either.

41:13.037 --> 41:14.595
And now you're in university.

41:14.705 --> 41:17.196
You look awfully young
to be in college.

41:17.341 --> 41:19.673
Everybody says that.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.209
But I'm a sophomore.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.040
Oh, a sophomore.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.704
Wow.

41:24.849 --> 41:27.613
You could have fooled me.

41:27.718 --> 41:30.448
I bet the boys really like you.

41:30.554 --> 41:31.612
I guess.

41:31.722 --> 41:32.984
Hmm, you guess.

41:33.123 --> 41:36.183
Of course they do.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.795
A fine young beauty like you.

41:38.896 --> 41:42.957
I remember when I was your age.

41:43.067 --> 41:46.559
Your mother must
worry herself silly.

41:52.009 --> 41:55.001
Here we go.

42:01.752 --> 42:03.811
Ah, you two have met.

42:03.921 --> 42:06.412
Excellent.

42:06.557 --> 42:09.549
Yes, and she's delightful.

42:09.693 --> 42:10.751
I couldn't be more pleased,

42:10.895 --> 42:12.362
and I know that Mother
will feel the same.

42:12.496 --> 42:13.656
Good, very good.

42:13.764 --> 42:17.165
You see, things are working out
perfectly after all.

42:17.268 --> 42:18.257
And you doubted me.

42:18.402 --> 42:19.869
I know.

42:20.004 --> 42:21.938
You were right, and I was wrong.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.835
I'm sorry.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.670
Well, then let's get to it.

42:25.776 --> 42:28.210
Mustn't let the night
get away from us.

42:28.345 --> 42:29.505
Isn't that right, Samantha?

42:29.613 --> 42:31.547
That's right.

42:31.682 --> 42:34.674
Oh, and Mother
is very private.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.343
So don't be put off by it.

42:36.453 --> 42:37.715
It's just her way.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.015
Don't worry.

42:39.123 --> 42:41.523
I warned her about both of you.

42:45.262 --> 42:49.096
You did, did you?

42:53.771 --> 42:55.864
Oh, yeah, don't forget
the pizza on the refrigerator.

44:23.027 --> 44:24.016
Hello?

44:24.161 --> 44:25.287
Hey.

44:25.396 --> 44:28.957
Oh, I'm not actually here.

44:29.066 --> 44:31.967
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

44:51.755 --> 44:53.416
Hello?

44:53.557 --> 44:56.822
Oh, I'm not actually here.

44:56.927 --> 44:59.862
But leave me a message,
and I'll call you right back.

44:59.997 --> 45:00.986
Beep!

45:01.098 --> 45:04.261
Megan, it's me.
Pick up.

45:04.401 --> 45:07.529
You're still not home yet?

45:07.671 --> 45:11.437
Sorry if you're mad.

45:11.575 --> 45:12.701
All right, I'll call you back.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.276
It's not that bad.

45:14.411 --> 45:16.402
Just hurry up and be home.

46:14.004 --> 46:15.471
Pizza Pizza.
What you eating?

46:15.606 --> 46:16.732
Yeah, hi.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.831
I'd like to place an order
for delivery.

46:18.976 --> 46:22.468
Okay, your address?

46:22.613 --> 46:25.275
Uh, one second.

46:29.153 --> 46:34.921
Uh, it is...
7714 East Beaumont.

46:35.025 --> 46:36.686
East Beaumont?

46:36.827 --> 46:38.852
Very cool.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.486
What can I get for you?

46:40.631 --> 46:41.655
Extra anchovies?

46:42.933 --> 46:45.197
No, just a small pizza
with pepperoni.

46:45.335 --> 46:46.632
We don't have small.

46:46.770 --> 46:48.169
Only medium and large.

46:48.305 --> 46:50.102
Okay, medium is fine.

46:50.207 --> 46:51.538
All right.

46:51.675 --> 46:54.143
One medium pep.

46:54.278 --> 46:57.179
That's going to be eight bucks.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.508
Okay, thank you.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.173
No, thank you.

47:00.317 --> 47:03.309
See you in 30.

51:07.264 --> 51:09.255
Hello, fish.

54:06.109 --> 54:07.406
Good evening.
I'm Elaine Cross.

54:07.544 --> 54:08.636
And I'm Ted Stephen.

54:08.778 --> 54:10.939
And welcome back
to Channel 13 News.

54:11.081 --> 54:14.107
Tonight's big eclipse
is now well under way.

54:14.251 --> 54:15.582
It is a total lunar eclipse,

54:15.719 --> 54:19.485
which I'm told means up to
two hours of no moon visibility.

54:19.623 --> 54:20.715
But more than half the moon

54:20.824 --> 54:22.815
has already entered
the Earth's shadow.

54:22.959 --> 54:24.893
Observers from all over
the Western Hemisphere

54:24.995 --> 54:27.156
are watching
this spectacular event.

54:27.297 --> 54:29.424
In fact, it's visible
from every continent

54:29.566 --> 54:31.591
this side of the globe,
except Antarctica.

54:31.735 --> 54:33.635
The best time to see
this fascinating event

54:33.770 --> 54:35.635
will be just about
the stroke of midnight.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.637
That's when you'll be able
to see the moon itself

54:37.774 --> 54:40.504
actually disappear
into the Earth's shadow.

54:40.644 --> 54:42.009
And that's it for us tonight.

54:42.145 --> 54:43.737
Stay tuned
for a special presentation

54:43.847 --> 54:46.111
of Frightmare Theatre
coming up next.

54:46.249 --> 54:47.238
Ooh, scary.

54:47.350 --> 54:48.408
Good night for a movie.

54:48.518 --> 54:49.746
Get the popcorn ready.

54:49.853 --> 54:52.515
I like mine with butter.

57:15.832 --> 57:17.959
Shit.

57:30.914 --> 57:34.008
Man.

57:34.150 --> 57:36.015
Frickin' idiot.

58:04.147 --> 58:07.139
Huh.

58:11.020 --> 58:14.012
I thought she said
these were in the basement.

58:43.753 --> 58:45.550
Hey, yo, check it.

58:45.688 --> 58:47.883
Volvo.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:28.090
Hello?

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:31.490
Oh, I'm not actually here.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.789
But leave me a message
and I'll-

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:05.150
Get a grip.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:30.710
Hello?

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:33.907
Mrs. Ulman?

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.042
Shit.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:55.854
Is everything all right
in there?

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:30.785
Keep the change.

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.296
Have a good night, ma'am.

01:05:36.432 --> 01:05:39.595
You too.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:47.558
We're sorry.

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.193
Your call cannot be completed
as dialed.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.499
Please check the number
and dial again

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:53.631
or call your operator-

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.018
It's okay.

01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:05.586
Everything's fine.

01:07:05.721 --> 01:07:07.985
She's fine.

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:11.253
Just relax.

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:14.488
Just get a grip.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.087
Get a grip.

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:21.427
Megan?

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.902
This is Gloria
with emergency services.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.436
We received a call
from this address.

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:28.873
I'm sorry.

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.411
I thought I hung up
before it connected.

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.573
Do you have an emergency?

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:35.706
No.

01:07:35.851 --> 01:07:36.840
Everything is fine.

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.920
I didn't mean to call.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.079
All right, then.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.689
Well, please remember
that this line

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.952
is reserved
for emergencies only.

01:07:44.093 --> 01:07:45.117
Yeah, I know.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:46.250
It was an accident.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.384
I'm sorry.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.691
Okay, have a good night, then.

01:07:49.799 --> 01:07:52.791
Thanks.

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:37.629
Ugh.

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:28.475
Ugh.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.665
Get her!

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.287
My eye!
My eye!

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:54.479
My eye!

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:06.257
Megan!

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:17.811
Ah!

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.926
There you are.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.413
It's happening.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.345
No matter what you do,
it won't stop.

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.347
It can't be stopped.

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.475
You'll see.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:41.612
It's gonna work in spite of you,
you little bitch.

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.165
Talk to me, lord.

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:56.031
Talk to me.

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:57.661
Please.

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:02.203
Talk to me.

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:04.539
Please, lord.

01:23:04.679 --> 01:23:09.116
I beg you.

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:32.124
Samantha, wait!

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.975
Samantha, listen to me.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.108
Get away from me!

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.242
Just stop.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:27.412
Just speak with me.

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:29.353
Stay back!

01:25:29.491 --> 01:25:30.924
All right.

01:25:31.025 --> 01:25:32.754
You don't need to do that.

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:39.361
What have you done to me?

01:25:40.635 --> 01:25:41.795
They're calling to you.

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:44.166
Just listen to them.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:51.603
He's given the sign.

01:25:51.713 --> 01:25:53.704
He's chosen you.

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:55.543
It's your destiny to accept him.

01:25:55.683 --> 01:25:56.843
No!

01:26:00.455 --> 01:26:02.548
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead.

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:03.952
Kill me if you want.

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.653
I'm just a messenger
who carries out his words.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.836
Only moments away now.

01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.341
No, no!

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.652
Astronomers everywhere
are still baffled

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.822
by how to explain
the bizarre event.

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:45.763
It seems that the speed at which

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.561
the moon exited
the Earth's shadow

01:26:47.702 --> 01:26:50.432
was faster than believed
theoretically possible.

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:52.699
And while this may be
intriguing to many,

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.331
scientists around the globe
cannot agree

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:57.274
on exactly why this occurred.

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:59.937
But experts are working hard
searching for answers,

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.709
and we will keep you informed
of any and all developments

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:05.842
as they come in.

01:28:41.382 --> 01:28:44.545
Poor thing.

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:45.675
Don't worry.

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:50.519
You're gonna be just fine.

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:53.525
Both of you.
