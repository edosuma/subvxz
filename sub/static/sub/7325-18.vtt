07:00.721 --> 07:01.922
AND HERE WE GO.
(clears throat)

07:01.922 --> 07:03.023
(indistinct conversations)

07:03.023 --> 07:04.555
(elevator bell dings)
OH, DR. AVERY.

07:04.555 --> 07:05.956
HEY, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT

07:05.956 --> 07:06.927
RAISING THE PROFILE
OF THE HOSPITAL.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.459
NOT TODAY, DR. BAILEY.

07:08.459 --> 07:09.860
TODAY I AM GOING TO THE E.R.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.202
TO FIND SOMETHING
TO OPERATE ON.

07:12.202 --> 07:13.734
WELL, I HAVE A PROPOSAL

07:13.734 --> 07:15.736
FOR A GREY SLOAN
HUMAN GENOME MAPPING PROGRAM

07:15.736 --> 07:17.167
THAT'LL COST LESS
THAN CHICAGO'S PROGRAM.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.209
NO MONEY. WE SPENT IT
ON THE NEW E.R.

07:19.209 --> 07:20.771
OKAY, IF YOU
AND THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS

07:20.771 --> 07:21.942
WOULD JUST READ OVER THE--

07:21.942 --> 07:24.144
I AM A DOCTOR TODAY,
BAILEY.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.547
HMM. OKAY. OKAY.
(siren wailing)

07:26.547 --> 07:27.718
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

07:27.718 --> 07:29.019
16-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.
A.T.V. COLLISION.

07:29.019 --> 07:30.551
G.C.S. IS 6.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.852
OPEN DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE
WITH ACTIVE BLEEDING.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.053
WHOA. LET'S TAKE HER
TO LODOX.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.885
GET A STATSCAN
BEFORE WE TAKE HER TO TRAUMA.

07:34.885 --> 07:36.186
THEY'RE USING THE LODOX.
THE LODOX?

07:36.186 --> 07:39.089
OH, SOMEONE SAY "LODOX"?
GOT HERE JUST IN TIME.

07:39.089 --> 07:40.931
SWEET.
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

07:40.931 --> 07:42.893
(Owen)
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

07:42.893 --> 07:45.736
LET'S GET READY
FOR THIS TRANSFER.

07:45.736 --> 07:47.868
ALL RIGHT, ON MY COUNT.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.840
HOLD ON.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.502
SHE'S BLEEDING THROUGH
THESE BANDAGES.

07:51.502 --> 07:52.743
ROSS, A.B.P. PADS.

07:52.743 --> 07:54.004
GOT IT.

07:54.004 --> 07:57.608
UH... IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S A BRANCH OF THE M.C.A.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.710
PRESSURE'S
NOT GONNA TAMPONADE IT.

07:59.710 --> 08:00.911
WE NEED TO GET HER
STRAIGHT TO THE O.R.

08:00.911 --> 08:03.714
UH, PAGE SHEPHERD.
ROSS, YOU'RE ON THIS.

08:03.714 --> 08:04.885
SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
WHAT ABOUT THE LODOX?

08:04.885 --> 08:05.856
SHE NEEDS
AN INTRAOPERATIVE C.T.

08:05.856 --> 08:07.558
IT'LL ONLY TAKE 13 SECONDS.

08:07.558 --> 08:09.560
WE DON'T HAVE 13 SECONDS
TO SPARE.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.791
SHE COULD STROKE OUT
AT ANY SECOND. LET'S MOVE!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.162
LET'S GO!

08:12.162 --> 08:14.494
(indistinct conversations)

08:14.494 --> 08:17.968
YOU GUYS WANT TO LOOK
FOR MY MARBLE?

08:17.968 --> 08:31.682
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:32.042 --> 08:33.283
MR. KRAMER.

08:33.283 --> 08:35.586
OUR BEST NEUROSURGEON--
DR. SHEPHERD--

08:35.586 --> 08:36.717
JUST STARTED OPERATING
ON YOUR DAUGHTER.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.988
YOU'RE GONNA FIX HER,
RIGHT?

08:37.988 --> 08:39.249
WELL, SHE SUSTAINED A LOT
OF DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.851
SINCE SHE WASN'T WEARING
A HELMET--

08:40.851 --> 08:42.052
SHE WAS WEARING A HELMET.

08:42.052 --> 08:43.594
WE HAVE BEEN RIDING
EVERY WEEKEND

08:43.594 --> 08:44.855
SINCE SHE WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

08:44.855 --> 08:47.027
I WOULD NEVER LET HER
NEAR A BIKE WITHOUT ONE.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.559
WE--WE STOPPED TO TAKE
A PICTURE.

08:48.559 --> 08:49.730
SHE TOOK HER HELMET OFF
FOR A MINUTE,

08:49.730 --> 08:51.131
AND THAT IDIOT COMES
FLYING OUT OF NOWHERE.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.163
I SWEAR TO GOD, I AM GONNA
HUNT THAT SON OF A BITCH DOWN

08:53.163 --> 08:54.865
AND I AM GONNA
CRACK HIS SKULL OPEN.

08:54.865 --> 08:56.206
WE'RE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN--

08:56.206 --> 08:57.668
SO WHAT ARE YOU
STANDING HERE FOR?

08:57.668 --> 08:58.869
GET IN THERE!

08:58.869 --> 09:00.140
(indistinct conversations)

09:00.140 --> 09:02.573
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

09:02.573 --> 09:04.745
DR. YANG,
YOU GOT A SEC?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.046
UM, I DON'T.
I'M LOOKING FOR DR. RUSSELL.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.578
WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR FUNDING.

09:07.578 --> 09:08.649
UGH.
YOU'RE PITCHING ME NOW?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.820
YEAH. YOU'RE ON THE BOARD.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.981
AND I HAVE
BEEN POSTPONING RESEARCH

09:10.981 --> 09:13.323
TO WRITE POLICY
TO BECOME, LIKE, A LAWYER,

09:13.323 --> 09:15.686
WHILE PEOPLE LIKE MARCUS CHO
ARE OUT THERE DOING IT.

09:15.686 --> 09:17.688
WE SHOULD BE DOING IT.
OH.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.029
DON'T YOU WANT THIS HOSPITAL

09:19.029 --> 09:20.891
TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE
OF MEDICAL RESEARCH?

09:20.891 --> 09:22.562
EXACTLY.
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.595
OKAY. THEN YOU'LL FUND
MY GENOME PROJECT.

09:24.595 --> 09:25.896
WHAT? NO.

09:25.896 --> 09:28.168
I NEED TO FIND SOME BADASS,

09:28.168 --> 09:30.040
EARTH-SHATTERING CARDIO RESEARCH
I CAN GET IN ON.
(sighs) OKAY--

09:30.040 --> 09:31.702
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY
I AM TO HEAR THAT.

09:31.702 --> 09:32.803
(elevator bell dings)

09:32.803 --> 09:35.706
DR. RUSSELL,
I NEED TO BE PUT TO WORK.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.648
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT RESEARCH
PROJECTS YOU HAVE PENDING--

09:37.648 --> 09:38.949
GREAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS AFTERNOON?

09:38.949 --> 09:40.580
OH.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.013
I THINK I HAVE
JUST THE PROCEDURE FOR YOU.
HUH.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.955
I GOT A PAGE.

09:44.955 --> 09:47.257
I'M SORRY. DO YOU KNOW
WHO NEEDED A G.Y.N. CONSULT?

09:47.257 --> 09:49.690
NO, I DON'T KNOW.
(speaks indistinctly)

09:49.690 --> 09:51.962
AHH. DR. GREY.

09:51.962 --> 09:53.994
DO YOU NEED A G.Y.N.?
NOPE.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.226
(ultrasound whooshing)
THEN WHO PAGED ME?

09:56.226 --> 09:57.828
(Owen clears throat)

09:57.828 --> 10:01.071
(indistinct conversations)

10:01.071 --> 10:02.833
(whooshing continues)

10:02.833 --> 10:04.134
CAN I HELP YOU?

10:04.134 --> 10:05.876
WELL, I NOTICED YOUR PATIENT
HAS ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

10:05.876 --> 10:07.107
ANY CHEST PAINS?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.609
BECAUSE IF YOU WANTED TO PUT HER
THROUGH THE LODOX

10:09.609 --> 10:11.712
FOR A FULL BODY SCAN,
YOU COULD.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.043
IF YOU WANTED,

10:13.043 --> 10:15.045
YOU KNOW, TO... (chuckles)
USE THE LODOX.

10:15.045 --> 10:16.687
DO I NEED
A FULL BODY SCAN?

10:16.687 --> 10:18.188
IT ONLY TAKES 13 SECONDS.
MM-HMM.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.820
NO, YOU DON'T.

10:19.820 --> 10:23.293
NO LODOX. THANK YOU.

10:23.293 --> 10:24.695
(sighs) UM...

10:24.695 --> 10:25.656
OH.
(elevator bell dings)

10:25.656 --> 10:28.198
(sighs) SO RECENTLY,

10:28.198 --> 10:30.200
THE PAIN HAS BEEN
GETTING WORSE?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.302
I THOUGHT I HAD
THE STOMACH FLU.
MM-HMM.

10:32.302 --> 10:34.665
I DROWN MYSELF
IN THAT SANITIZER STUFF,

10:34.665 --> 10:35.806
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TEACHING KIDS,

10:35.806 --> 10:38.669
OH, THEY'RE JUST
LITTLE GERM BAGS.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.672
AH, I'VE BEEN OUT
FOR A WEEK.

10:41.672 --> 10:43.043
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.745
OH, IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR ME.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.317
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A DAY OFF
IN 28 YEARS.

10:47.317 --> 10:48.779
MM.

10:48.779 --> 10:50.650
YOU KNOW HOW MANY, UM,
COOKING SHOWS THEY HAVE NOW?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
I DON'T.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.685
IT TURNS OUT, I LOVE
WATCHING PEOPLE COOK THINGS.

10:54.685 --> 10:57.287
AND THEN THIS MORNING,
THE PAIN WAS SO BAD,

10:57.287 --> 10:59.930
I COULDN'T MOVE,
SO I-I CALLED THE AMBULANCE.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.391
OKAY, MADELINE, SO FROM
WHAT I'M SEEING HERE,

11:01.391 --> 11:02.893
IT LOOKS LIKE GALLSTONES.

11:02.893 --> 11:04.364
OH, GOD.
DOES THAT MEAN SURGERY?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.836
(clicks keyboard key)
IT DOES.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.768
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
WE CAN DO IT LAPAROSCOPICALLY,

11:07.768 --> 11:08.969
WHICH MEANS NO BIG INCISIONS

11:08.969 --> 11:10.741
AND VERY LITTLE RECOVERY TIME.

11:10.741 --> 11:12.442
AND I'LL TAKE THEM OUT,
AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY.

11:12.442 --> 11:14.845
WELL, I GET TO WATCH
SOME MORE PEOPLE COOK STUFF.

11:14.845 --> 11:16.306
(laughs)

11:16.306 --> 11:18.879
OKAY, SO I'M GONNA GET THEM
STARTED ON ADMITTING YOU.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.050
YOU JUST SIT TIGHT.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.912
GREAT. THANK YOU.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.413
(indistinct conversations)

11:23.413 --> 11:25.085
DID YOU JUST UPDATE
YOUR PATIENT FILE?

11:25.085 --> 11:26.256
MM-HMM.

11:26.256 --> 11:27.758
WATCH THIS.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.019
(beeps)

11:29.019 --> 11:30.791
(chirping)

11:30.791 --> 11:32.292
SO COOL!

11:32.292 --> 11:34.394
YOU DO GET EXCITED
ABOUT THINGS.
(beep)

11:34.394 --> 11:36.296
YES, I DO.
HEY, HOW'S THAT BABY?

11:36.296 --> 11:38.428
OH, IT PROBABLY HAS
THREE ARMS AND A TAIL.

11:38.428 --> 11:39.800
(laughs)

11:39.800 --> 11:41.071
HOW'S YOUR
PARAMEDIC BOYFRIEND?

11:41.071 --> 11:42.232
TERRIBLE.

11:42.232 --> 11:43.774
I MEAN, UM, GREAT.

11:43.774 --> 11:44.775
PERFECT. JUST NOT--

11:44.775 --> 11:46.807
I PROBABLY HAVE TO
BREAK UP WITH HIM.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.008
WHY?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.740
(beep)
OKAY, ARE--
ARE YOU REALLY ASKING?

11:49.740 --> 11:51.742
BECAUSE I REALLY NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

11:51.742 --> 11:53.944
WELL, NOW I'M NOT SURE
I'M ASKING.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.115
(exhales) OKAY.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.047
UH, MATTHEW'S NEVER...

11:57.047 --> 11:59.719
BEEN TO THE CARNIVAL.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.421
AND HE THINKS THAT
I HAVEN'T EITHER

12:01.421 --> 12:03.123
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM,
BUT I HAVE.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.454
I'M SORRY.

12:04.454 --> 12:05.896
AND YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE CARNIVAL TOGETHER?

12:05.896 --> 12:09.029
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ALREADY
AND I... RODE THE RIDES.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.430
(elevator bell dings)
OH.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.432
YOU WENT TO THE CARNIVAL
WITH JACKSON.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.304
(exhales)
I HAVE RIDDEN THE RIDES...

12:14.304 --> 12:15.405
(whispers) AND THEY ARE GOOD--

12:15.405 --> 12:17.137
(normal voice)
THE TILT-A-WHIRL AND THEN

12:17.137 --> 12:18.308
THAT ONE THAT SPINS AROUND

12:18.308 --> 12:19.840
WHEN YOUR BACK
IS UP AGAINST THE WALL

12:19.840 --> 12:21.311
AND THEN THE FLOOR FALLS OUT
FROM UNDERNEATH YOUR FEET.

12:21.311 --> 12:23.313
AND I WANT MATTHEW
TO GO WITH ME,

12:23.313 --> 12:25.145
BUT HE WANTS TO WAIT,

12:25.145 --> 12:28.178
WHICH IS... WHY HE'S PERFECT,

12:28.178 --> 12:29.479
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.181
I ALWAYS WANTED TO WAIT,
BUT I DIDN'T WAIT.

12:31.181 --> 12:32.783
AND NOW I JUST--

12:32.783 --> 12:35.285
EVERY NIGHT
PUSH HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER.

12:35.285 --> 12:37.227
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M JUST GONNA SLIP

12:37.227 --> 12:38.859
AND BUY HIM A TICKET AND SHOVE
HIM ON THE TILT-A-WHIRL,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.191
AND THEN HE'S GONNA LOVE IT,
AND I WILL HAVE CORRUPTED HIM.

12:41.191 --> 12:42.793
AND I-I'M NOT A CORRUPTER.

12:42.793 --> 12:44.494
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
TALKING TO ME ABOUT THIS.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.196
I AM A BIG FAN
OF THE CARNIVAL

12:46.196 --> 12:47.497
AND I GO EVERY CHANCE
I GET.

12:47.497 --> 12:48.869
YES, I KNOW, BUT--

12:48.869 --> 12:50.500
OKAY,
SO YOUR WHOLE THING IS,

12:50.500 --> 12:52.442
UH, GOD HAS A PLAN,
RIGHT?

12:52.442 --> 12:54.044
YEAH.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.375
WELL, THERE MUST BE A REASON

12:55.375 --> 12:57.507
WHY GOD LET YOU GO
TO THE CARNIVAL ALREADY.

12:57.507 --> 12:59.779
MAYBE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE MATTHEW.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.183
YOU'RE RIGHT, I SHOULD NOT BE
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.554
(siren wails)

13:04.554 --> 13:05.856
FANCY NEW E.R.,

13:05.856 --> 13:07.217
AND ALL I'VE DONE
IS SPLINT A PINKIE?

13:07.217 --> 13:08.889
THIS IS WHY WE BOUGHT
A HOSPITAL?

13:08.889 --> 13:11.091
UH, HEY.
IF--IF WE GET OFF...

13:11.091 --> 13:12.362
(sighs)

13:12.362 --> 13:15.095
AT A DECENT TIME, UM,
AND WE PUT SOFIA DOWN EARLY,

13:15.095 --> 13:18.128
AND I COULD MAKE DINNER,
AND WE COULD, UM...

13:18.128 --> 13:21.231
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:21.231 --> 13:22.472
(laughs)
REALLY?

13:22.472 --> 13:23.503
REALLY.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.237
SO...

13:27.237 --> 13:28.909
YOU THINK TONIGHT?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.540
IS DEFINITELY
THE NIGHT.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.582
FOR SEX, RIGHT?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SEX?

13:32.582 --> 13:33.543
THE SEXY NIGHT.

13:33.543 --> 13:35.015
OKAY. (laughs)

13:35.015 --> 13:36.516
LADIES, HEY, JUST THE TWO
PEOPLE I WAS LOOKING FOR.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.848
UH, WALK AWAY, BAILEY.

13:37.848 --> 13:39.950
NO, NO, I NEED TO SPEAK
TO BOARD MEMBERS,

13:39.950 --> 13:41.521
AND I REMEMBER YOU ALL
GIVING ME SOME KIND OF CRAP

13:41.521 --> 13:43.423
ABOUT HOW THE DOOR'S
ALWAYS OPEN, SO--

13:43.423 --> 13:45.095
OH, BUT RIGHT NOW
IT'S CLOSED.
ONE MINUTE.

13:45.095 --> 13:46.256
IT'S THE WRONG MINUTE.

13:46.256 --> 13:47.527
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.900
OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE NEW HOSPITAL,

13:49.900 --> 13:51.962
RUN BY DOCTORS,
ALL ABOUT DOCTORS?

13:51.962 --> 13:53.463
OKAY, WELL, IT--
WHAT HAPPENED IS,

13:53.463 --> 13:55.435
MY WIFE'S NEW LEG
IS MAKING HER FEEL SEXY.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.607

21:53.082 --> 21:55.645
BUT THIS SUCKS.

21:55.645 --> 21:59.489
(continues crying)

21:59.489 --> 22:00.820
(indistinct conversations)

22:00.820 --> 22:02.792
I ONLY HAVE A DOG BITE
AND TWO PATIENTS WITH THE FLU.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.654
I HAVE A SPRAINED ANKLE.

22:04.654 --> 22:06.826
YEAH, LET'S DO THAT.
GET HIM IN THE MACHINE.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.728
HE DOESN'T NEED
A FULL BODY SCAN.

22:08.728 --> 22:09.829
IT'S A REALLY BAD SPRAIN.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.601
I HAVE A STOMACHACHE.

22:11.601 --> 22:12.962
STOMACHACHE COULD BE
A TUMOR, KIDNEY STONES.

22:12.962 --> 22:14.734
(Jackson)
NO, I HAVE A STOMACHACHE.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.406
WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS ON THAT THING,

22:16.406 --> 22:17.737
AND IT'S JUST SITTING THERE.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.338
(sighs)

22:19.338 --> 22:20.870
(sighs)

22:20.870 --> 22:22.772
OKAY,
HOW BAD IS THE SPRAIN?

22:22.772 --> 22:23.743
(elevator bell dings)

22:23.743 --> 22:24.974
WHAT?

22:24.974 --> 22:27.777
(inhales sharply) OW.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.881
OH.

22:31.881 --> 22:33.022
(people speaking indistinctly)

22:33.022 --> 22:36.426
THAT ASS DOES NOT QUIT.

22:36.426 --> 22:38.428
THESE HEELS
ARE KILLING ME.

22:38.428 --> 22:39.829
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

22:39.829 --> 22:42.832
I MEAN, HEELS WERE A PAIN
EVEN BEFORE I HAD A PLASTIC LEG.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.664
WHY'D I THINK
IT'D BE BETTER NOW?

22:44.664 --> 22:45.835
CAN I TAKE A LOOK?

22:45.835 --> 22:46.936
NOPE.

22:46.936 --> 22:48.768
OH, WELL, I JUST MIGHT
BE ABLE TO HELP.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.369
MM. YOU'RE NOT MY DOCTOR.
YOU'RE MY WIFE.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.601
HERE WE GO.

22:51.601 --> 22:52.772
WHAT?

22:52.772 --> 22:54.674
UH, WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

22:54.674 --> 22:55.875
WH--I--WHO SAID--

22:55.875 --> 22:57.447
WHO SAID THAT WE'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE SEX TONIGHT?

22:57.447 --> 22:58.608
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

22:58.608 --> 22:59.779
YOU JUST TOLD ME
YOUR LEG HURTS

22:59.779 --> 23:00.780
SO THAT TONIGHT
WHEN I PUT ON

23:00.780 --> 23:02.051
MY DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS
UNDERWEAR,

23:02.051 --> 23:03.413
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
TO CHANGE INTO MY SWEATS.

23:03.413 --> 23:04.814
AND THEN
WHEN I LOOK DISAPPOINTED,

23:04.814 --> 23:06.486
YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "PLEASE
DON'T MAKE THAT FACE, CALLIE.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.817
YOU KNOW THAT MY LEG'S
BEEN BOTHERING ME TODAY,"

23:07.817 --> 23:08.788
AND... (sighs deeply)

23:08.788 --> 23:10.490
WHAT KIND
OF MANIPULATIVE BITCH

23:10.490 --> 23:11.891
DO YOU THINK I AM?

23:11.891 --> 23:12.992
YOU'RE NOT MANIPULATIVE
AND YOU'RE NOT A BITCH.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.524
OKAY? I'M A BITCH.
YEAH.

23:14.524 --> 23:15.895
YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE
LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN

23:15.895 --> 23:17.026
FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW,

23:17.026 --> 23:18.397
AND IF WERE
A REALLY GOOD PERSON,

23:18.397 --> 23:19.569
I WOULD
CONTINUE TO BE PATIENT,

23:19.569 --> 23:20.700
BUT APPARENTLY, I'M NOT.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.171
(hands slap legs)

23:23.733 --> 23:24.904
(door opens)

23:24.904 --> 23:26.606
(sighs)
(door closes)

23:26.606 --> 23:28.638
(indistinct conversations)

23:28.638 --> 23:29.779
A G.Y.N. PATIENT
JUST CAME IN.

23:29.779 --> 23:31.641
THIS TIME I HAVE A NAME.
TALIA.

23:31.641 --> 23:34.684
IF YOU CAN FIND HER,
YOU CAN TREAT HER.

23:34.684 --> 23:37.416
I'M LOOKING FOR
A MS. TALIA.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.988
A JENNY TALIA.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.149
(elevator bell dings)

23:40.149 --> 23:42.822
I'M HERE TO SEE
JENNY TALIA.

23:42.822 --> 23:43.853
(laughing)

23:43.853 --> 23:47.156
OH, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

23:47.156 --> 23:48.658
(Alex and Pablo laugh)

23:48.658 --> 23:49.829
YEAH.
AHH.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.030
KAREV.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.562
A MOMENT.

23:52.562 --> 23:53.863
UH-OH.

23:53.863 --> 23:55.705
(indistinct conversations)

23:55.705 --> 23:56.906
(laughs)

23:56.906 --> 23:58.437
(lowered voice)
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

23:58.437 --> 23:59.569
DR. WEBBER, I WAS--

23:59.569 --> 24:00.740
OUT OF ALL THE CHILDISH,

24:00.740 --> 24:02.472
SOPHOMORIC THINGS
TO DO TO SOMEONE,

24:02.472 --> 24:04.073
THIS MAY BE THE MOST PATHETIC.

24:04.073 --> 24:06.476
COME ON.
LOOK AT THE KID.

24:06.476 --> 24:08.848
HE LIVES IN THIS HOSPITAL.
HE NEVER GETS TO HAVE ANY FUN.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.179
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

24:10.179 --> 24:11.881
THE BIG DEAL IS, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BETTER THAN THIS.

24:11.881 --> 24:14.153
JENNY TALIA?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.687
YOU NEED TO UP YOUR GAME.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.489
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:19.489 --> 24:21.731
YOU'RE CUTTING RIGHT INTO
HER FRONTAL LOBE.

24:21.731 --> 24:23.032
CALM DOWN, ROSS.

24:23.032 --> 24:24.734
HER WHOLE PERSONALITY
COULD BE AFFECTED.

24:24.734 --> 24:25.895
HER MEMORY COULD BE GONE,

24:25.895 --> 24:27.236
AND THAT MAN OUT THERE
IS GONNA KILL ME.

24:27.236 --> 24:29.569
DID I EVER TELL YOU THE FIRST
TIME I WENT FLY-FISHING?

24:29.569 --> 24:30.740
NO.

24:30.740 --> 24:31.871
YEAH, I WENT OUT
TO THE HOH RIVER

24:31.871 --> 24:33.743
TO FISH WINTER STEELHEAD.

24:33.743 --> 24:36.746
FOR HOURS, I TRIED TO CAST
LIKE I'D PRACTICED.

24:36.746 --> 24:40.179
BUT IF YOU OVER TRY,
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.111
AND THEN JUST ONCE,

24:42.111 --> 24:43.913
THE ROD LOADED PERFECTLY.

24:43.913 --> 24:45.815
THE LINE FORMED
A TIGHT LOOP,

24:45.815 --> 24:48.888
AND THE FLY JUST DANCED OUT
OVER THE RIVER ABOUT 70 FEET.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.020
IT HAD A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.022
SEE, THE KEY WAS TO RELAX,

24:53.022 --> 24:56.095
FEEL THE RHYTHM,
AND LET THE ROD DO THE WORK.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.668
JUST ONE PERFECT CAST.

24:58.668 --> 25:00.499
WHY'D YOU TELL ME THAT?

25:00.499 --> 25:02.271
DID IT CALM YOU DOWN?

25:02.271 --> 25:04.634
YEAH.
MM-HMM.

25:04.634 --> 25:07.506
RIGHT NOW I AM ABOUT TO
REMOVE A HEMATOMA

25:07.506 --> 25:08.978
FROM BROCA'S AREA.

25:08.978 --> 25:12.542
AND IF I AM NOT CAREFUL,
SHE'LL NEVER SPEAK AGAIN.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.744
THERE IS
A LOT TO BE AFRAID OF.

25:14.744 --> 25:15.945
(instruments clatter)

25:15.945 --> 25:18.748
PATIENTS WILL BE AFRAID.
PARENTS WILL BE AFRAID.

25:18.748 --> 25:20.620
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO GET THROUGH IT

25:20.620 --> 25:22.291
IS FOR YOU TO STAY CALM.

25:22.291 --> 25:23.793
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:23.793 --> 25:26.025
THE BRAIN IS SWELLING.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.127
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
ABOUT THAT?

25:28.127 --> 25:29.298
(beeping continues)

25:29.298 --> 25:30.800
WE'RE GONNA...

25:30.800 --> 25:33.202
WE'RE GONNA GIVE HER
MORE MANNITOL.

25:33.202 --> 25:34.834
GOOD.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.667
(beeping continues)

25:37.667 --> 25:39.008
THAT WAS AMAZING.

25:39.008 --> 25:40.810
THE VALVE STARTED OPERATING
BEFORE I FULLY RELEASED IT.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.141
INCREDIBLE, RIGHT?

25:42.141 --> 25:43.813
AND ALMOST
NO PARAVALVULAR LEAKAGE?

25:43.813 --> 25:46.215
REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY,

25:46.215 --> 25:49.318
AND THE RATE OF SUCCESS WITH
PHASE TWO HAS BEEN ASTOUNDING.

25:49.318 --> 25:50.850
WELL, WHEN DO WE START
PHASE THREE?

25:50.850 --> 25:52.582
WELL, THAT'S UP TO YOU,
REALLY.

25:52.582 --> 25:53.823
UP TO ME?

25:53.823 --> 25:56.325
(indistinct conversations)

25:56.325 --> 25:58.828
YOU'RE--YOU'RE GIVING
PHASE THREE TO ME?

25:58.828 --> 26:00.860
NO. NO.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.592
IT'S MY TRIAL.

26:02.592 --> 26:03.933
I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER SURGEON.

26:03.933 --> 26:05.294
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU
IS $12 MILLION

26:05.294 --> 26:07.296
SO I CAN KEEP IT GOING,
FOR PATIENT RECRUITMENT,

26:07.296 --> 26:09.338
RESEARCH STAFF,
LAB SPACE.

26:09.338 --> 26:12.041
I WANT TO MAKE GREY SLOAN
THE PREMIER DESTINATION

26:12.041 --> 26:14.203
FOR THIS PROCEDURE.

26:14.203 --> 26:17.607
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BRINGING ME ON TO THIS.

26:17.607 --> 26:18.908
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE PITCHING ME.

26:18.908 --> 26:20.910
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY HAVE
SOMEONE ON THE BOARD

26:20.910 --> 26:22.712
WHO GETS WHAT I'M DOING.
(slaps arm)

26:22.712 --> 26:25.715
(indistinct conversations
continue)

26:32.221 --> 26:33.763
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

26:33.763 --> 26:34.894
THE ADMINISTRATIVE CRAP
IS TAKING OVER MY CAREER.

26:34.894 --> 26:37.166
RUSSELL CALLED ME
"SOMEONE ON THE BOARD."

26:37.166 --> 26:39.128
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T EVEN
SEE ME AS A SURGEON.

26:39.128 --> 26:40.299
(exhales deeply)

26:40.299 --> 26:42.071
I'M JUST SOMEONE
WHO CUTS BUDGETS.

26:42.071 --> 26:44.003
UGH. STOP KICKING
IN THERE.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.935
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU, CHOKING
ON YOUR CORD OR SOMETHING?

26:45.935 --> 26:48.678
CRISTINA,
PLEASE TALK TO IT.

26:48.678 --> 26:50.039
HE OR SHE.
WHO?

26:50.039 --> 26:52.011
THE BABY.
NO.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.043
THE SOUND OF MY VOICE
ONLY MAKES IT KICK HARDER.

26:54.043 --> 26:55.845
FOR SOME REASON,
DEREK CAN CALM IT DOWN.

26:55.845 --> 26:57.116
MAYBE YOU CAN, TOO.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.118
YOU KNOW, I'LL TALK TO IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.650
WHEN SHE GETS
HER FIRST PERIOD.

27:00.650 --> 27:01.921
I'LL TAKE THAT
OFF YOUR PLATE.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.022
OR IF IT HAS A PENIS,

27:03.022 --> 27:05.324
I'LL TELL HIM
NOT TO THINK WITH IT.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.727
OW. CRISTINA,
PLEASE JUST TALK TO IT.

27:07.727 --> 27:08.958
(sighs)

27:10.329 --> 27:11.861
(sighs)

27:11.861 --> 27:13.362
HELLO.

27:13.362 --> 27:15.705
THIS IS... CRISTINA...

27:15.705 --> 27:16.866
(people speaking indistinctly)

27:16.866 --> 27:18.007
YANG.

27:18.007 --> 27:19.368
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

27:19.368 --> 27:21.010
ANYTHING. JUST TALK.

27:21.010 --> 27:23.212
OH, GET UP.

27:23.212 --> 27:25.675
HEY, UH,
THIS IS MIRANDA BAILEY.

27:25.675 --> 27:28.377
I AM AN EXCELLENT SURGEON
AND A FORWARD THINKER.

27:28.377 --> 27:31.921
YOUR MOTHER'S A SURGEON.
YOUR FATHER IS A SURGEON.

27:31.921 --> 27:34.053
YOU'LL VERY LIKELY
WANT TO BE ONE, TOO.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.756
BUT I'M HOPING BY THE TIME
IT'S YOUR TURN,

27:36.756 --> 27:38.888
THERE WILL BE
VERY LITTLE SURGERY LEFT

27:38.888 --> 27:41.731
BECAUSE HUMAN GENOME MAPPING

27:41.731 --> 27:43.192
WILL HAVE
GIVEN PEOPLE INFORMATION

27:43.192 --> 27:46.996
SO THAT THEY CAN FIGHT THEIR
DISEASES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.799
KEEP TALKING.
IT'S WORKING.

27:49.799 --> 27:53.202
UM, ARMED WITH INFORMATION,

27:53.202 --> 27:56.906
PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE
LONGER, HEALTHIER LIVES.

27:56.906 --> 28:00.750
NOW I KNOW THIS IS
A VERY EXPENSIVE UNDERTAKING,

28:00.750 --> 28:02.882
BUT MAYBE IF YOU HADN'T SPENT
SO MUCH MONEY

28:02.882 --> 28:05.314
ON COFFEE SLEEVES
AND NEW LOGOS,

28:05.314 --> 28:07.016
THERE'D BE MONEY IN THE BUDGET

28:07.016 --> 28:08.918
TO FUND A FORWARD THINKER
LIKE ME.

28:08.918 --> 28:11.090
I THINK SHE'S TALKING
TO US NOW.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.292
(sighs) LOOK,

28:13.292 --> 28:16.125
HERE IS MY PROPOSAL,

28:16.125 --> 28:18.768
WHICH I'VE MADE TO YOU

28:18.768 --> 28:20.229
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

28:20.229 --> 28:22.401
WHICH IS MESSED UP,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE

28:22.401 --> 28:26.105
BECAUSE I WANT YOUR MONEY.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.177
MM.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.080
(sighs)

28:31.080 --> 28:34.283
WE ARE IN CHARGE.

28:34.283 --> 28:36.916
I AM IN CHARGE.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.948
I AM GONNA CRUSH
MARCUS CHO

28:38.948 --> 28:40.449
BECAUSE I AM IN CHARGE.

28:40.449 --> 28:41.891
WAIT. DON'T LEAVE. I--

28:41.891 --> 28:44.093
HEY, CRISTINA,
PLEASE TALK TO IT. OW.

28:44.093 --> 28:46.856
(woman) OKAY, RIGHT.

28:46.856 --> 28:48.297
O-OKAY.

28:48.297 --> 28:50.760
THAT WAS THE AMBULANCE
FROM EARLIER.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.031
THEY THOUGHT THEY LEFT
ONE OF THEIR BACKBOARDS HERE.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.202
THEY FOUND IT.

28:53.202 --> 28:54.333
(groans)

28:54.333 --> 28:56.335
(people speaking indistinctly)

28:56.335 --> 28:58.037
ALL RIGHT. BROOKS.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.208
WHOA.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:59.208 --> 29:00.369
HOP IN.

29:00.369 --> 29:01.811
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

29:01.811 --> 29:02.972
LET'S FIND THAT MARBLE,
AND THE REST OF YOU,

29:02.972 --> 29:05.044
LINE UP AND WATCH.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.245
(clicks keyboard keys)

29:06.245 --> 29:07.446
AT THE VERY LEAST,
WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT

29:07.446 --> 29:09.278
HOW TO RUN THIS DAMN THING.
(scanner whirs)

29:09.278 --> 29:10.749
CHIEF, WE GOT A MOTORCYCLE
ACCIDENT COMING IN.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.921
EXTENSIVE CRUSH INJURIES.

29:11.921 --> 29:13.883
HOP OUT.
BUT IT ONLY TAKES 13 SECONDS.

29:13.883 --> 29:16.956
OUT NOW. AND THE REST OF YOU,
LET'S PREP FOR INCOMING.
(scanner powers down)

29:16.956 --> 29:18.888
(woman) DR. MARSHA LOWE
TO THE E.R.

29:18.888 --> 29:21.360
DR. MARSHA LOWE TO THE E.R.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.332
(elevator bell dings)

29:23.332 --> 29:25.034
IS THAT A SPECIMEN CUP?

29:25.034 --> 29:26.495
YEAH.

29:26.495 --> 29:28.497
DID YOU PLACE A WARM CUP
OF PEE NEXT TO ME?

29:28.497 --> 29:29.869
IT'S MY URINE SAMPLE.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.040
WHAT, SHOULD I GO
PUT IT ON YOUR DESK?

29:31.040 --> 29:32.501
IF YOU WANT TO DIE.

29:32.501 --> 29:34.203
BUT THE MEMO SAYS THAT
YOU'RE IN CHARGE

29:34.203 --> 29:35.945
OF THE RANDOM DRUG
TEST POLICY.
(Alex and Richard snickering)

29:35.945 --> 29:37.877
OKAY, WHATEVER DRUGS
YOU ARE DOING, STOP!

29:37.877 --> 29:41.981
(Alex and Richard laughing)

29:41.981 --> 29:43.983
(sighs)
(ding)

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985

29:45.985 --> 29:47.116
MNH-MNH.

29:47.116 --> 29:48.317
(indistinct conversations)

29:48.317 --> 29:49.458
EW.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.459
(snickers)

29:50.459 --> 29:52.061
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

29:52.061 --> 29:53.322
UH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE HOSPITAL'S SLOW.

29:53.322 --> 29:54.994
THE DOCTORS
START PUNKING EACH OTHER.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.166
OH. WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

29:57.166 --> 30:01.030
THAT WE FOUND FUNDING
FOR YOUR PROJECT.

30:01.030 --> 30:02.001
OH, I GET IT.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.073
YOU POPULAR KIDS
ARE PUNKING ME,

30:04.073 --> 30:07.136
LIKE THIS IS SOME
HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL TEAM.

30:07.136 --> 30:09.378
WELL, I DO NOT WANT TO PLAY
VARSITY THAT BAD, KIMBERLY.

30:09.378 --> 30:12.041
BAILEY, YOU GET
YOUR GENOME LAB, FOR REAL.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.382
YEAH, RIGHT.

30:13.382 --> 30:15.014
YEAH, CRISTINA JUST ASSEMBLED
A QUICK BOARD MEETING.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.185
NOW WE HAVEN'T DOTTED
ALL THE I's

30:16.185 --> 30:17.516
OR CROSSED ALL THE T's YET,

30:17.516 --> 30:19.048
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR FUNDING.

30:19.048 --> 30:20.449
BUT AVERY SAID THERE WASN'T
ANY MORE MONEY.

30:20.449 --> 30:22.121
YEAH, WELL, ONE OF THE OTHER
DEPARTMENTS CUT THEIR BUDGET.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.293
AAH!
(laughs)

30:24.293 --> 30:26.395
(sucks teeth)
(Russell)
YOU'RE CUTTING MY BUDGET?

30:26.395 --> 30:27.556
JUST BY A COUPLE MILLION.

30:27.556 --> 30:29.128
I ASKED YOU FOR MORE MONEY,
NOT LESS.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.530
I'LL HAVE TO LOSE A RESIDENT,
A-A RESEARCH ASSISTANT--

30:31.530 --> 30:33.532
PROBABLY TWO...
(elevator bell dings)

30:33.532 --> 30:35.034
OF EACH. SORRY.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.565
WAIT. WAIT.

30:36.565 --> 30:38.167
WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE
ME WITH?

30:38.167 --> 30:39.338
IT LEAVES YOU WITH ME.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.910
TO DO THE WORK
OF FOUR PEOPLE? (huffs)

30:40.910 --> 30:42.071
I AM THE BEST FOUR PEOPLE

30:42.071 --> 30:43.412
YOU WILL EVER HAVE
WORKING FOR YOU.

30:43.412 --> 30:45.975
I WILL TREAT YOUR PATIENTS,
TAKE YOUR SURGERIES,

30:45.975 --> 30:47.316
AND ASSIST IN RESEARCH,

30:47.316 --> 30:49.318
INCLUDING PROJECTS
I FIND ON MY OWN.

30:49.318 --> 30:50.950
FEEL FREE TO PILE IT ON.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.451
BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY--

30:52.451 --> 30:55.584
OH, THE BOARD
BELIEVES YOU CAN.

30:55.584 --> 30:58.928
(indistinct conversations)

31:00.890 --> 31:02.591
(woman) DR. SANCHEZ

31:02.591 --> 31:03.893
OH.

31:03.893 --> 31:05.995
WELL... (sighs)

31:05.995 --> 31:08.067
I TOLD BAILEY SHE'S GETTING
HER GENOME LAB.

31:08.067 --> 31:11.270
SHE WAS SO HAPPY. (laughs)
SHE LOOKED GREAT.

31:11.270 --> 31:14.303
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

31:14.303 --> 31:15.574
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

31:15.574 --> 31:16.946
(voice breaking) YEAH.

31:16.946 --> 31:18.477
I'M JUST--
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR BAILEY.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.509
NO, YOU'RE IN PAIN.
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING ALL DAY.

31:20.509 --> 31:21.981
HERE. SIT DOWN.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.913
(chair wheels clattering)

31:23.913 --> 31:25.614
YOU KNOW, I REALLY--
I DON'T--

31:25.614 --> 31:27.016
I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP SAYING YES

31:27.016 --> 31:28.457
AND THEN NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH
WITH IT, OKAY?

31:28.457 --> 31:30.119
I-I REALLY DON'T.

31:30.119 --> 31:32.061
(clicks lock)
NO, I'M A JERK
FOR PUTTING PRESSURE ON YOU.

31:32.061 --> 31:33.562
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THAT I CAN TRY.

31:33.562 --> 31:35.925
I CAN TRY. IT'S JUST--I NEED
TO ADJUST THIS THING.

31:35.925 --> 31:37.396
LET ME HELP.
CALLIE, DON'T.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.198
I AM AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.400
LET ME TRY.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.573
(sighs)

31:44.573 --> 31:46.205
GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

31:46.205 --> 31:50.039

35:39.208 --> 35:41.910
MR. KRAMER, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ALIVE.

35:41.910 --> 35:43.412
UNTIL SHE WAKES UP--
NO, NO, NO.

35:43.412 --> 35:45.544
NO, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T YOU DO THAT!

35:45.544 --> 35:47.576
LOOK, SIR, PLEASE!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME THAT.
YOU DO NOT--

35:47.576 --> 35:49.218
NO!
LISTEN!

35:49.218 --> 35:50.419
YOUR DAUGHTER...
(grunting)

35:50.419 --> 35:52.521
YOUR DAUGHTER IS ALIVE,
YOU HEAR ME?

35:52.521 --> 35:53.682
LISTEN TO ME.

35:53.682 --> 35:56.185
YOUR DAUGHTER IS ALIVE.

35:56.185 --> 35:59.228
(panting)

35:59.228 --> 36:00.889
SHE'S ALIVE.

36:00.889 --> 36:02.491
AND WE HOPE SHE'S GONNA
WAKE UP,

36:02.491 --> 36:04.263
BUT WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.465
OKAY?
HER VITALS ARE STABLE.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.467
BUT IT DOESN'T DO YOU
OR HER ANY GOOD

36:08.467 --> 36:11.240

36:11.240 --> 36:14.743

36:23.482 --> 36:25.814

36:27.316 --> 36:30.489

36:31.690 --> 36:33.792

36:37.796 --> 36:39.628
(boy)
MR. ARNOLD ALWAYS YELLS.

36:39.628 --> 36:41.300

36:41.300 --> 36:44.233
I-I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE HIM
BECAUSE HE'S NOT ME,

36:44.233 --> 36:46.275
BUT--BUT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE ME AT FIRST,

36:46.275 --> 36:47.436
DID YOU? (laughs)

36:47.436 --> 36:48.937
BUT AT LEAST YOU GAVE US
FREE TIME

36:48.937 --> 36:50.439
IF WE FINISHED OUR HOMEWORK.

36:50.439 --> 36:52.210
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL HIM

36:52.210 --> 36:53.582
THAT THAT'S HOW I DID IT

36:53.582 --> 36:55.284
AND THAT IT MOTIVATED YOU.

36:55.284 --> 36:56.445
RIGHT?

36:59.248 --> 37:02.791
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:04.323 --> 37:06.224
IF...

37:07.896 --> 37:09.958
IF, UM...

37:09.958 --> 37:11.930
MR. ARNOLD WERE--
WERE GOING TO BE YOUR TEACHER

37:11.930 --> 37:13.762
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR,

37:13.762 --> 37:16.505
WHAT ELSE COULD YOU DO
TO--TO HELP HIM?

37:16.505 --> 37:19.007
SOMEONE COULD OFFER HIM
A MINT.

37:19.007 --> 37:21.009
(all laugh)
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

37:21.009 --> 37:22.541
BUT NOT IN A MEAN WAY.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.613
JUST--JUST CASUALLY, RIGHT?
(laughs)

37:24.613 --> 37:25.914
WHAT ELSE?

37:25.914 --> 37:28.817
DON'T SKIP
AFTER-SCHOOL STUDY SESSIONS?

37:28.817 --> 37:29.978
YOU GOT IT.

37:29.978 --> 37:31.320
BUT HE'S NOT GONNA BE
OUR TEACHER

37:31.320 --> 37:33.251
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.753
IS HE?

37:38.287 --> 37:39.688
(sniffles and whimpers)

37:39.688 --> 37:40.959
(sniffles)

37:42.561 --> 37:45.464
YOU'RE NOT GONNA COME BACK...

37:45.464 --> 37:47.566
ARE YOU?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.405
(voice breaking) WHAT...

37:56.405 --> 37:58.347
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF I DIDN'T?

37:58.347 --> 37:59.978
(exhales)

37:59.978 --> 38:01.750
(sniffling and crying)

38:01.750 --> 38:04.282
IT'D SUCK.

38:06.054 --> 38:08.317
SORRY.

38:10.389 --> 38:13.862
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

38:13.862 --> 38:15.724
IT'D SUCK.

38:19.968 --> 38:21.400
NOW...

38:21.400 --> 38:24.933
WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO
TO HELP MR. ARNOLD?
