GARBAGE.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.453
I'LL TAKE

AND A PRUNE DANISH

01:48.227 --> 01:50.634

01:53.010 --> 01:56.355
HEY, GIVE ME ALL
YOUR FUDGE BROWNIES, TOO!

01:58.163 --> 02:01.506
HERE'S ALL THE DOUGH
YOU'LL GET, LAWBREAKER.

02:04.351 --> 02:07.527
ALL LAWBREAKERS
MUST PAY THE PRICE.

02:08.699 --> 02:11.039
AND FOR THE ICING
ON THE CAKE...

02:15.156 --> 02:17.028
CHECK THIS JUNK OUT.

6-PIECE CROQUET SET.

HOLD IT,
SPORTS FANS.

02:32.451 --> 02:34.958
WHY, YOU...

02:34.959 --> 02:37.634
GO AHEAD.
MAKE MY NIGHT.

02:38.672 --> 02:41.012
WATCH--WATCH IT!

02:41.013 --> 02:44.492
CATCH YOU
ON THE SLOPES, PUNK.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.540
THIS GUY'S A PSYCHO!

02:48.541 --> 02:51.851
YOU COULD USE A LITTLE
IRON IN YOUR DIET.

02:53.726 --> 02:57.237
CONSIDER YOURSELF
SLAM-DUNKED, SCUZZBALL.

03:00.215 --> 03:03.860
CASEY JONES IS GOING
TO CLEAN UP THIS CITY.

03:03.861 --> 03:06.603
WHO WAS THAT
MASKED MANIAC?

03:06.604 --> 03:10.082
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I HATE HIM!

03:15.436 --> 03:17.308
OH, HELLO?

03:17.309 --> 03:19.114
APRIL, IT'S VERN.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.222
BIG, BIG, BIG,
BIG STORY, APRIL!

03:21.223 --> 03:22.292
UP AND AT 'EM!

03:24.300 --> 03:28.046
VERN, IT'S 5:00
IN THE MORNING.

03:28.047 --> 03:30.822
SOME DO-GOODER'S
GONE ON A CRIME
FIGHTING RAMPAGE,

03:30.823 --> 03:34.235
VIOLATING ALL
SORTS OF CRIMINAL
CIVIL LIBERTIES.

03:34.236 --> 03:36.509
THE COPS THINK
IT'S THOSE 4
FREAKED OUT TURTLES

03:36.510 --> 03:37.646
ON THE LOOSE AGAIN.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.591
I'LL TAKE THE STORY, VERN,

03:40.592 --> 03:42.531
BUT ONLY TO PROVE
THEY'RE WRONG!

03:42.532 --> 03:44.805
THE TURTLES
AREN'T VIGILANTES.

03:44.806 --> 03:46.545
WHY, THEY'RE
PROBABLY ON THE TRAIL

03:46.546 --> 03:48.117
OF THIS WACKO RIGHT NOW!

03:52.400 --> 03:54.171
NOT A TRACE.

03:54.172 --> 03:55.644
WE'VE LOOKED
HIGH AND LOW.

03:55.645 --> 03:58.019
AND THERE'S
NO GETTING AROUND IT.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.427
WE'RE COMPLETELY
OUT OF PEPPERONI.

04:00.428 --> 04:02.133
BUMMER, DUDES!

04:02.134 --> 04:04.474
WE CAN'T MAKE
PIZZA WITHOUT IT.

04:04.475 --> 04:08.321
THEN, WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO GO TOPSIDE AND GET SOME!

04:09.627 --> 04:11.299
OH, WHERE ARE WE
GONNA FIND PEPPERONI

04:11.300 --> 04:12.971
AT 5:00
IN THE MORNING?

04:12.972 --> 04:15.881
HEY, WE'LL HIT
AN ALL-NIGHT
HEARTBURN PALACE.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.988
HIT? MUST BE GANGSTERS

04:17.990 --> 04:20.331
ON THEIR WAY
TO A BIG HEIST.

04:22.038 --> 04:25.215
HOLY GUACAMOLE!

04:25.216 --> 04:28.527
TASTE FRESH LUMBER,
LAWBREAKERS.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.444
DON'T YOU HATE IT
WHEN COMPANY
JUST DROPS IN?

04:35.318 --> 04:38.930
I'LL TEACH YOU CRIMINALS
TO BEFOUL OUR SEWERS.

04:38.931 --> 04:41.941
CALM DOWN. NOW,
WE'RE NOT CRIMINALS.

04:41.942 --> 04:45.487
LYING GANGSTER SCUM.

04:45.488 --> 04:48.665
THE DUDE SAID
CHILL OUT!

04:53.349 --> 04:55.355
SO, THAT'S
YOUR GAME, IS IT?

04:55.356 --> 04:57.763
WELL, MINE'S MUDSLINGING.

04:58.834 --> 05:01.644
THIS GUY IS STARTING
TO GET ON MY NERVES.

05:01.645 --> 05:04.119
ALL RIGHT NOW.
DON'T MOVE!

05:04.120 --> 05:05.658
WE AREN'T CRIMINALS--

05:05.659 --> 05:07.665
LOOK!

05:07.666 --> 05:08.836
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:08.837 --> 05:11.010
YOU'RE...NOT CRIMINALS.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.118
YOU'RE MARTIAN INVADERS!

05:13.855 --> 05:15.325
THE

05:15.326 --> 05:17.600
THE MARTIANS ARE COMING!

05:17.601 --> 05:18.871
WHAT A DING-A-LING.

05:18.872 --> 05:20.544
TOTALLY NUTSOID.

05:20.545 --> 05:22.886
WE'D BETTER STOP
HIM BEFORE HE GETS
IN TROUBLE!

05:22.887 --> 05:24.390
OR STARTS SOME.

05:31.249 --> 05:34.928
YOU SAY THIS TINY DEVICE
CAN CONTROL ANY MACHINE,

05:34.929 --> 05:36.600
NO MATTER HOW LARGE?

05:36.601 --> 05:38.273
PRECISELY.

05:38.274 --> 05:40.447
INGENIOUS, ISN'T IT?

05:40.448 --> 05:43.124
A FEW HUNDRED
OF THESE LITTLE BUGS

05:43.125 --> 05:45.967
WOULD THROW THE CITY
INTO TOTAL CONFUSION!

05:45.968 --> 05:48.643
AND CONTROL
THE MACHINERY NEEDED

05:48.644 --> 05:52.322
TO MAKE MY NEW
SUPER-SIZED KNUCKLEHEAD.

05:52.323 --> 05:55.167
THEN THIS
MISERABLE PLANET

05:55.168 --> 05:58.210
WILL SEE
SOME REAL CHAOS.

05:58.211 --> 05:59.849
BEBOP AND ROCK STEADY

05:59.850 --> 06:02.525
ARE ALREADY UNLEASHING
THEM ON THE CITY.

06:02.526 --> 06:04.532
LET'S GET
TO THE SURFACE.

06:04.533 --> 06:07.878
I DON'T WANT TO MISS
A MOMENT OF THIS.

06:18.249 --> 06:20.891
OK, THIS IS OUR STOP.

06:23.601 --> 06:26.443
KIDS, WE'RE TRAINED
PROFESSIONALS.

06:26.444 --> 06:28.685
DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME.

06:35.075 --> 06:37.482
MIDTOWN. THIS IS THE PLACE.

06:37.483 --> 06:39.657
UH, GO ON, LITTLE BUGS.

06:39.658 --> 06:41.330
HAVE FUN.

06:48.589 --> 06:50.362
ALL RIGHT.
WHERE'D HE GO?

06:53.707 --> 06:55.546
DON'T YOU KNOW
THERE'S NO LOITERING

06:55.547 --> 06:56.851
IN THIS PARK?

06:58.892 --> 07:00.062
WH--WHAT'S UP?

07:00.063 --> 07:02.404
YOU'RE BREAKING
THE LAW, BUSTER.

07:02.405 --> 07:05.315
WHA--HELP!

07:05.316 --> 07:07.956
SOUNDS LIKE OUR BOY'S
ON THE JOB AGAIN.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.238
YOU'LL DO TIME
FOR THIS,
LAWBREAKER.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.097
LET ME GO,
YOU MARTIAN CREEPS!

07:19.098 --> 07:21.037
WE'RE NOT MARTIANS.

07:21.038 --> 07:24.448
WE'RE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES.

07:24.449 --> 07:27.125
OH, AND THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER?

07:27.126 --> 07:28.730
LET ME GO!

07:28.731 --> 07:31.641
THAT VICIOUS CRIMINAL
IS GETTING AWAY.

07:31.642 --> 07:33.414
HEY, WHO APPOINTED YOU

07:33.415 --> 07:35.622
JUDGE, JURY,
AND EXECUTIONER?

07:35.623 --> 07:38.097
THIS CITY'S
A CESSPOOL OF CRIME.

07:38.098 --> 07:39.937
SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO CLEAN IT UP.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.620
AND THAT SOMEONE IS ME.

07:51.813 --> 07:57.365
NOT EVEN MUTANT CRIMINALS
CAN STOP CASEY JONES.

07:57.366 --> 08:00.175
THAT GUY'S SEEN TOO MANY
FILTHY HARRY MOVIES.

08:00.176 --> 08:02.015
COME ON!
WE BETTER STOP HIM.

08:02.016 --> 08:03.353
WHY US?

08:03.354 --> 08:04.858
LET THE COPS
HANDLE IT.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.597
THINK, RAPHAEL.

08:06.598 --> 08:08.805
HE POPS IN AND OUT
OF THE SEWERS.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.211
HE FIGHTS CRIME.

08:10.212 --> 08:11.917
HE KNOWS KUNG FU.

08:11.918 --> 08:13.054
IN OTHER WORDS,

08:13.055 --> 08:14.994
PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO THINK HE'S US.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.039
NOW DO YOU SEE WHY
WE HAVE TO STOP HIM?

08:18.040 --> 08:21.517
YEAH, OUR REPTILE
REPUTATIONS'LL
GET A BAD RAP.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.093
HE HAD THIS MASK ON,

08:24.094 --> 08:26.635
BUT I GUESS HE
COULD'VE BEEN A TURTLE.

08:26.636 --> 08:29.311
<i>April: OR POSSIBLY
SOME OTHER CREATURE?</i>

08:29.312 --> 08:31.988
HEY, DON'T
CONFUSE ME, LADY.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.828
I FLUNKED ZOOLOGY.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.634
WAS THIS MYSTERY VIGILANTE

08:35.635 --> 08:38.309
ONE OF THE TEENAGE
MUTANT NINJA TURTLES?

08:38.311 --> 08:39.982
NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.323
AND THAT ABOUT--

08:42.325 --> 08:43.629
[PANICKED]
WRAPS IT UP!

08:46.674 --> 08:48.245
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:54.133 --> 08:56.006
SPLENDID!

08:56.007 --> 09:00.020
THIS IS WORKING OUT EVEN
BETTER THAN I'D PLANNED.

09:02.932 --> 09:05.439
HELP! OFFICERS!

09:07.046 --> 09:08.416
OH, GREAT!

09:08.417 --> 09:10.892
I'M COPLESS!

09:14.639 --> 09:16.980
SAY CHEESE, CHEESE BALL.

09:16.981 --> 09:18.485
OH, TURTLES!

09:18.486 --> 09:19.991
THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE.

09:22.802 --> 09:25.342
HAS YOUR CAMERA
ALWAYS ACTED LIKE THAT?

09:25.343 --> 09:28.353
IT'S LIKE IT SUDDENLY
HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN.

09:28.354 --> 09:31.999
AND WORSE, MY SCOOTER
DROVE OFF BY ITSELF!

09:32.000 --> 09:33.706
OH, WE'LL DEAL
WITH THAT LATER.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.177
RIGHT NOW,
WE'VE GOT TO FIND

09:35.178 --> 09:37.051
THAT DIPSTICK
IN THE HOCKEY MASK.

09:37.052 --> 09:38.690
YOU MEAN THE GUY
WHO'S BEEN GOING AROUND

09:38.691 --> 09:40.028
BEATING UP CRIMINALS?

09:40.029 --> 09:41.233
THAT'S THE DUDE.

09:41.234 --> 09:43.541
HE CALLS HIMSELF
CASEY JONES.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.815
AND WE JUST CHASED
HIM OUT OF THE PARK.

09:45.816 --> 09:47.890
WELL, YOU'RE DOING
BETTER THAN I AM.

09:48.995 --> 09:51.334
WE'VE GOT TROUBLES.

09:51.335 --> 09:53.241
THE CARS ARE MOVING...

09:53.242 --> 09:54.513
WITHOUT DRIVERS!

09:54.514 --> 09:57.055
THAT'S NOTHING.
LOOK!

09:59.666 --> 10:01.772
I'VE HEARD OF
UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS,

10:01.773 --> 10:03.779
BUT UNHAPPY
MERCHANDISE?

10:03.780 --> 10:05.954
COME ON, WE'VE GOT
TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE.

10:05.955 --> 10:08.295
AND I'VE GOT TO
GET A NEW CAMERA.

10:08.296 --> 10:10.402
THIS IS WHAT
I CALL A STORY!

10:14.417 --> 10:16.490
OH, JUST WHAT
THE WORLD NEEDS,

10:16.491 --> 10:18.430
A LIVING FRIDGE.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.214
NOW COOL OUT!

10:24.285 --> 10:25.690
OW! HEY! OW!

10:25.691 --> 10:26.760
STO--OH, WAIT!

10:32.682 --> 10:35.558
GO PUT THE BITE
ON SOMEONE ELSE, DUDE.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.876
NOBODY LIKES
A WISE-GUY APPLIANCE.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.835
WHOA! I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

10:47.836 --> 10:49.106
AND WHAT'S WORSE,

10:49.107 --> 10:51.414
I'LL BET
IT'S HAPPENING
ALL OVER TOWN.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.260
WITH THIS
REMOTE CONTROL,

11:04.261 --> 11:06.333
THE BUGS
IN THOSE MACHINES

11:06.334 --> 11:08.072
WILL DO OUR BIDDING.

11:15.132 --> 11:19.045
I JUST LOVE A MACHINE
THAT KNOWS ITS PLACE.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.256
BUT WHAT IF
SOMEONE SHOULD FIND
ONE OF THESE BUGS?

11:22.257 --> 11:24.230
NOT TO WORRY.

11:24.231 --> 11:26.906
EACH OF THEM IS PROGRAMMED
TO HEAD FOR HOME

11:26.907 --> 11:28.946
THE INSTANT
IT'S DISCOVERED.

11:28.947 --> 11:31.757
NOW WE CAN
START CONSTRUCTION

11:31.758 --> 11:34.432
OF MY SUPER KNUCKLEHEAD.

11:34.433 --> 11:38.146
BUGS, BEGIN CONSTRUCTION
OF THIS DESIGN.

11:48.617 --> 11:49.854
SOON...

11:49.855 --> 11:53.868
SOON I WILL RULE
THIS ICKY CITY.

11:59.857 --> 12:02.466
I HAVEN'T MET THE TOASTER
I COULDN'T TOAST.

12:18.088 --> 12:21.934
THIS IS GETTING
MONDO RIDICULOSO.

12:21.935 --> 12:24.074
THERE'S JUST
TOO MANY OF THEM.

12:27.722 --> 12:29.461
WHAT A WAY TO GO.

12:29.462 --> 12:32.337
DONE IN BY MODERN
CONVENIENCES.

12:32.338 --> 12:34.345
THERE'S A MESSAGE
THERE SOMEWHERE.

12:37.624 --> 12:39.730
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.

12:39.731 --> 12:42.708
EVEN MACHINES
MUST OBEY THE LAW.

12:48.931 --> 12:52.341
FACE STERN JUSTICE,
APPLIANCES.

13:05.121 --> 13:07.495
NOW, WHO'S A NUTCASE?

13:07.496 --> 13:08.900
YOU ARE.

13:08.901 --> 13:12.044
UH, BUT THANKS
FOR SAVING OUR SHELLS.

13:12.045 --> 13:13.416
I HATE TO SAY IT,

13:13.417 --> 13:15.255
BUT THIS GUY'S
DESTRUCTIVE STREAK

13:15.256 --> 13:16.895
MIGHT JUST
COME IN HANDY.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.936
I THINK YOU'RE
RIGHT, RAPHAEL.

13:18.937 --> 13:20.273
BUT, LIKE,

13:20.274 --> 13:22.750
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT
WHO'S BEHIND THIS.

13:22.751 --> 13:24.455
I'LL GIVE YOU 3 CLUES,

13:24.456 --> 13:26.797
AND THEY'RE
ALL SHREDDER.

13:26.798 --> 13:29.205
AND I THINK I JUST
FOUND ANOTHER CLUE.

13:33.555 --> 13:35.494
YOU MEAN
SOME LAWBREAKER

13:35.495 --> 13:37.501
IS USING
THESE LITTLE THINGS

13:37.502 --> 13:39.743
TO CONTROL
ALL THE MACHINES?

13:39.744 --> 13:41.248
THAT'S ABOUT
THE SIZE OF IT.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.099
WHERE'S HE
SCOOTING OFF TO
IN SUCH A HURRY?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.373
PROBABLY TO WHEREVER
SHREDDER IS.

13:48.374 --> 13:51.015
COME ON! WE'VE
GOT TO FOLLOW IT.

13:51.016 --> 13:52.220
CASEY JONES,

13:52.221 --> 13:54.796
YOU'RE GOING
TO DO SOME GOOD
FOR A CHANGE.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.757
WITH THIS GADGET,

14:02.758 --> 14:04.764
WE CAN STAY
ON THE LITTLE
BUGGER'S TAIL.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.354
OK. GO LEFT.

14:11.355 --> 14:12.893
YOU GOT IT.

14:15.571 --> 14:17.007
N-NOW GO RIGHT.

14:19.585 --> 14:21.156
NOW LEFT AGAIN.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.772
NOW, GO STRAIGHT.

14:27.245 --> 14:28.248
UH, STRAIGHT?

14:28.249 --> 14:29.418
YES!

14:29.419 --> 14:30.421
ARE YOU SURE?

14:30.422 --> 14:31.827
YES, I'M SURE.

14:31.828 --> 14:33.198
OK...

14:33.199 --> 14:35.574
BUT I DON'T
THINK YOU'RE
GOING TO LIKE IT!

14:42.733 --> 14:44.906
TOTAL BUMMER, DUDES.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.928
WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED?

14:50.929 --> 14:52.433
YOU GAVE US
BAD DIRECTIONS.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.705
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED!

14:53.706 --> 14:54.942
YEAH, DUDE.

14:54.943 --> 14:56.681
TOTALLY BOGUS.

14:56.682 --> 14:58.387
OH, NO WONDER.

14:58.388 --> 15:00.695
ONE OF THOSE BUGS
GOT IN MY EQUIPMENT.

15:06.049 --> 15:07.553
GRAB IT!

15:11.903 --> 15:13.574
NOW WHAT?

15:13.575 --> 15:15.415
WE USE THE PORTATRACKER.

15:16.553 --> 15:18.023
WHAT I WANT
TO KNOW IS...

15:18.024 --> 15:19.930
WHEN WE GET
TO BREAK SOMETHING?

15:19.931 --> 15:22.473
I LIKE THIS
BOY'S ATTITUDE.

15:22.474 --> 15:24.780
[CLICKING]
THIS WAY. COME ON.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.769
I'D SAY THAT'S
WHERE IT WENT.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.255
OK, LET'S BE
CAREFUL NOW.

15:36.256 --> 15:38.362
CAREFUL, MY EYE!

15:38.363 --> 15:40.604
LET'S BUST SOME CRIME!

15:44.920 --> 15:46.625
WHOA, THE DUDE
SURE KNOWS

15:46.626 --> 15:48.431
HOW TO MAKE
AN ENTRANCE.

15:52.613 --> 15:54.954
WELL, WELL,
THE TURTLES.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.626
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

15:56.627 --> 15:58.165
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME

15:58.166 --> 16:00.975
TO SEE KRANG
STOMP THE CITY FLAT...

16:02.315 --> 16:06.161
IN HIS GIANT,
ECONOMY-SIZED
KNUCKLEHEAD!

16:09.874 --> 16:11.412
IT WORKS PERFECTLY.

16:15.695 --> 16:17.065
NO MATTER.

16:17.066 --> 16:20.378
THIS BABY MAKES
ITS OWN DOORWAYS.

16:26.098 --> 16:28.740
THESE MACHINES
WILL FINISH YOU

16:28.741 --> 16:31.282
WHILE I CAUSE
MORE CHAOS

16:31.283 --> 16:33.290
WITH MY LITTLE BUGS.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.264
COME!

16:38.543 --> 16:41.653
WE'VE GOT TO GET
THAT REMOTE CONTROL
AWAY FROM SHREDDER.

16:41.654 --> 16:44.496
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE
OF SAVING THE CITY.

16:44.497 --> 16:45.800
LOTS OF LUCK.

16:45.801 --> 16:48.711
LISTEN, YOU WANT
TO CATCH CRIMINALS?

16:48.712 --> 16:51.755
<i>THAT IS
THE CRIMINAL
OF ALL TIME!</i>

16:51.756 --> 16:53.327
BESIDES WHICH,

16:53.328 --> 16:55.435
HE RIPPED OFF
YOUR COSTUME IDEA.

16:55.436 --> 16:57.542
TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT.

16:57.543 --> 16:59.784
HOW LOW CAN YOU GET?

16:59.785 --> 17:01.791
NOW, GO
GET 'EM, FELLA.

17:01.792 --> 17:03.864
WE NEED THAT
REMOTE CONTROL.

17:03.865 --> 17:05.805
YOU HANDLE SHREDDER.

17:09.586 --> 17:13.298
CASEY JONES IS GOING
AFTER THE BIG BOSS MAN.

17:13.299 --> 17:15.973
COME BACK, LAWBREAKER.

17:15.974 --> 17:18.080
A DEFINITE DUFUS.

17:18.082 --> 17:20.156
MORE TROUBLE!

17:20.156 --> 17:21.527
LIKE WE
NEEDED IT, RIGHT?

17:26.546 --> 17:29.555
I HEREBY PLACE YOU
UNDER ARREST.

17:31.597 --> 17:33.469
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

17:35.678 --> 17:38.320
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE
TO GET TOUGH WITH YOU.

17:40.663 --> 17:42.367
TAKE THAT.

17:42.368 --> 17:43.973
PESKY HUMAN.

17:48.189 --> 17:51.399
SPLENDID!
NOW I CAN KEEP AN EYE

17:51.400 --> 17:53.841
ON THAT BOTHERSOME BRAT.

17:55.882 --> 17:59.227
NOW TO REALLY
TURN UP THE JUICE.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.806
I DON'T BELIEVE ALL THIS.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.337
HELP! SAVE ME!

18:11.338 --> 18:12.675
I'M THE BOSS.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.116
<i>YOU SAVE ME.</i>

18:16.221 --> 18:17.726
THAT WAS CLOSE.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.569
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:27.060 --> 18:28.665
HOW COULD YOU?

18:28.666 --> 18:32.009
I SAT UNDER
A HOT DRYER FOR 3 HOURS

18:32.010 --> 18:33.582
TO GET THIS LOOK.

18:34.687 --> 18:36.358
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES?

18:36.359 --> 18:39.101
WHY AREN'T THEY
DOING SOMETHING?

18:39.102 --> 18:41.108
HEY, GIVE US A BREAK.

18:41.109 --> 18:43.450
WE'RE DOING
THE BEST WE CAN!

18:43.451 --> 18:47.096
SOME PEOPLE
ARE SO DARN IMPATIENT.

18:47.097 --> 18:48.601
FOLLOW ME, FELLAS.

18:53.487 --> 18:55.091
ALL RIGHT, SHREDDER.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.600
HAND OVER
THAT CONTROL BOX.

18:57.601 --> 18:59.507
TO YOU? NEVER!

18:59.508 --> 19:01.949
QUIT STALLING.
HAND IT OVER.

19:01.950 --> 19:05.294
YOU HEARD HIM,
CHROME-FOR-BRAINS!

19:07.302 --> 19:10.679
GOTCHA! THIS WILL BRING
EVERY BUG IN THE CITY.

19:11.986 --> 19:14.158
COME ON!
WE'RE GONNA GIVE KRANG

19:14.159 --> 19:16.668
A TASTE OF
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

19:19.177 --> 19:21.350
STOP! QUIT IT!

19:21.351 --> 19:23.425
DOWN, BOY!

19:28.376 --> 19:30.550
THEY'VE STOPPED
ATTACKING US.

19:30.551 --> 19:32.724
OH! IT'S A MIRACLE!

19:32.725 --> 19:35.066
MACHINES TURN ON HUMANS.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.742
IT'S THE STORY
OF THE YEAR!

19:37.743 --> 19:40.418
VERNON, I WANT YOU
TO WRITE IT!

19:40.419 --> 19:42.258
ON ONE OF THOSE THINGS?

19:42.259 --> 19:43.763
NO WAY!

19:46.842 --> 19:49.450
LOOK! IT'S GOT CASEY.

19:49.451 --> 19:52.193
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

19:52.194 --> 19:53.631
DON'T PANIC, DUDE.

19:53.632 --> 19:55.773
IT'S
THE RADICAL REPTILES

19:55.774 --> 19:57.278
TO THE RESCUE!

20:00.490 --> 20:01.827
THANKS, FELLA.

20:01.828 --> 20:03.667
NO TIME FOR THANKS.

20:03.668 --> 20:05.373
WE NEED A HOLE
IN THAT THING,

20:05.374 --> 20:06.845
AND FAST.

20:06.846 --> 20:08.183
WITH PLEASURE.

20:09.422 --> 20:13.334
HURRY UP!
HERE COME THE BUGS!

20:14.841 --> 20:17.181
HERE, CATCH.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.720
WHAT IS IT?

20:18.721 --> 20:21.597
NEVER MIND.
JUST THROW IT INSIDE!

20:22.735 --> 20:24.541
NOW GET THE HECK
OUT OF THERE.

20:30.797 --> 20:33.138
NOTHING CAN STOP ME.

20:44.646 --> 20:47.187
TIME TO BAIL OUT.

20:52.139 --> 20:53.811
CATCH HIM!

21:02.209 --> 21:04.448
HE GOT AWAY.

21:04.449 --> 21:05.887
DON'T LET IT
THROW YOU, GUY,

21:05.888 --> 21:07.861
YOU SORT OF
GET USED TO IT
AFTER A WHILE.

21:07.862 --> 21:09.901
AHH, SO MUCH
FOR THOSE BUGS

21:09.902 --> 21:12.544
AND KRANG'S
GIANT KNUCKLEHEAD.

21:12.545 --> 21:14.083
AND WE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT

21:14.084 --> 21:15.655
WITHOUT YOU, CASEY.

21:15.656 --> 21:18.632
YEAH.
YOU ARE TRULY--

21:18.633 --> 21:19.937
GONE!

21:19.938 --> 21:21.275
HOW'D YOU LIKE THAT?

21:21.276 --> 21:22.980
HE DIDN'T EVEN
SAY GOOD-BYE.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.620
HE WAS STRANGE GUY.

21:24.621 --> 21:27.464
RECKLESS, DANGEROUS,
AND TOTALLY VIOLENT.

21:27.465 --> 21:29.504
YEAH. I LIKED HIM, TOO.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.979
SOMEHOW,
I'VE GOT THE FEELING

21:31.980 --> 21:33.853
HE'LL CROSS
OUR PATHS AGAIN.

21:33.854 --> 21:38.536
SOMEHOW, I'VE GOT
A FEELING HE'S RIGHT.
