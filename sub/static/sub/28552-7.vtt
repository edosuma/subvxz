00:17.894 --> 00:20.394
Mayday! Mayday!

00:20.438 --> 00:21.438
Does anybody read me?!

00:23.399 --> 00:24.482
Stupid, no good...

00:24.526 --> 00:27.485
<i>- Della!</i>
- Uncle Scrooge!

00:27.529 --> 00:28.589
<i>Turn back!
It's too dangerous!</i>

00:28.613 --> 00:31.614
<i>The Cosmic Storm's
coming at ya!</i>

00:31.658 --> 00:32.658
<i>- Della!</i>

00:49.842 --> 00:51.467
Aah!

00:51.511 --> 00:53.052
- Ohh! Oh!

01:04.399 --> 01:05.438
Oh, no!

01:05.483 --> 01:06.524
Oh, no no no!

01:06.568 --> 01:07.568
No no no <i> no!</i>

01:18.580 --> 01:20.329
Yes! Oxy-Chew!

01:27.255 --> 01:30.006
Unhh! Ugh!

01:30.049 --> 01:32.425
Uch! Black licorice?

01:42.228 --> 01:43.519
Aaah! Unh!

02:06.044 --> 02:07.126
Aw, phooey.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.143
I'm coming, boys.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.360
<i>Yes! Ha ha! It works!</i>

02:32.403 --> 02:33.944
<i>Whoo! Take that, science!</i>

02:33.988 --> 02:37.448
<i>Okay, hey, Uncle Scrooge.
Or Donald.</i>

02:37.492 --> 02:38.802
<i>Or literally anybody
who can hear me.</i>

02:38.826 --> 02:39.867
<i>This is Della Duck!</i>

02:43.373 --> 02:44.413
- <i>-Meh!</i>

02:44.457 --> 02:45.915
<i>Right, so here's what's up:</i>

02:45.958 --> 02:49.502
<i>the freak cosmic storm
knocked out most of my systems.</i>

02:49.545 --> 02:51.212
<i>But because
I am an amazing pilot,</i>

02:51.255 --> 02:52.963
<i>I landed the ship safely.</i>

02:53.007 --> 02:54.007
<i>For the most part.</i>

02:55.468 --> 02:57.760
<i>Eh? Ehhhh?!</i>

02:58.596 --> 03:01.305
<i>Pretty cool robot leg.</i>

03:01.349 --> 03:02.640
<i>I'm still working on it.</i>

03:02.684 --> 03:04.308
<i>Maybe add some jets
or a can opener?</i>

03:04.352 --> 03:05.935
<i>Anyway...
I've been able to survive</i>

03:05.978 --> 03:09.939
<i>in the thin lunar atmosphere
thanks to Gyro's Oxy-Chew.</i>

03:12.777 --> 03:14.902
<i>It provides oxygen,
water, and nutrition.</i>

03:14.946 --> 03:17.780
<i>And tastes terrible.</i>

03:17.824 --> 03:19.824
<i>Black licorice.
Worst flavor ever.</i>

03:19.867 --> 03:21.331
<i>It's fine.</i>

03:22.412 --> 03:24.012
<i>I'm sure the flavor
will wear off soon.</i>

03:24.706 --> 03:26.016
<i>I've activated
my distress beacon,</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:28.833
<i>so if you're getting
these transmissions,</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:31.116
<i>you'll be able to pinpoint
my location and come get me.</i>

03:32.714 --> 03:36.215
<i>I've made efforts
to get off this rock myself.</i>

03:52.942 --> 03:54.275
Aaah!

03:54.318 --> 03:55.860
<i>It did not go great.</i>

03:55.903 --> 03:59.196
<i>In the meantime, I've put
together a pretty boss shelter.</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:00.406
<i>Got a nice comfy bed.</i>

04:02.368 --> 04:04.452
<i>A calendar marking
the days I've been here.</i>

04:06.914 --> 04:09.039
<i>And the, uh... family room.</i>

04:14.005 --> 04:16.005
<i>Bet the boys
have hatched by now.</i>

04:16.048 --> 04:17.673
<i>Not even sure
what they look like.</i>

04:17.716 --> 04:18.841
<i>Ooh! Uh, hold on.</i>

04:21.721 --> 04:22.928
<i>Here we go!</i>

04:25.224 --> 04:26.891
<i>That's better!</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:30.019
<i>Donald, if you're there,
put the screen up to the crib.</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:32.730
<i>Hey, kids! I'm your mom!</i>

04:32.774 --> 04:34.293
<i>I know I'm
on a little trip, for now,</i>

04:34.317 --> 04:36.400
<i>but I'll keep sending
these transmissions.</i>

04:36.444 --> 04:39.278
<i>You'll barely know I'm gone!</i>

04:39.322 --> 04:41.530
<i>I promise I'm coming home,
somehow.</i>

04:43.576 --> 04:46.494
<i>Nothing can stop Della Duck!</i>

04:46.537 --> 04:48.015
<i>Oh, man, we're gonna go
on so many amazing adventures</i>

04:48.039 --> 04:50.498
<i>when I get back.</i>

04:50.541 --> 04:52.269
<i>In fact, there's
this old song about adventure</i>

04:52.293 --> 04:53.209
<i>-that I used to sing to...</i>

04:53.252 --> 04:55.169
- <i>-Ohhh! Unh!</i>

04:55.213 --> 04:58.464
<i>Aah! What are you?!</i>

04:58.508 --> 04:59.715
<i>Aah!
Its face has tentacles!</i>

05:02.804 --> 05:04.386
<i>I'm not alone.</i>

05:04.430 --> 05:07.807
<i>There's
a horrifying bug monster</i>

05:07.850 --> 05:09.141
<i>out there trying to eat me.</i>

05:09.185 --> 05:12.102
<i>Important life lesson
on bug monsters, kids:</i>

05:12.146 --> 05:13.499
<i>you're gonna be worried
about the pincers,</i>

05:13.523 --> 05:16.524
<i>but, remember, their spit
is corrosive, too.</i>

05:16.567 --> 05:17.817
<i>Hmm.</i>

05:17.860 --> 05:20.319
<i>That's Day 192.</i>

05:20.363 --> 05:21.904
<i>The gum has
not yet lost its flavor.</i>

05:41.843 --> 05:43.551
- <i>-Soooo...</i>

05:43.594 --> 05:45.594
<i>it's been a few months.</i>

05:45.638 --> 05:46.998
<i>I haven't heard back
from anyone.</i>

05:48.307 --> 05:50.558
<i>I need to find some other way
to call for help.</i>

05:50.601 --> 05:53.519
<i>Luckily, I found this
in the wreckage!</i>

05:53.563 --> 05:54.979
<i>My old
Junior Woodchuck Guidebook!</i>

05:57.400 --> 05:58.774
<i>"How to survive
a shipwreck.</i>

05:58.818 --> 06:02.027
Create a signal
for passing ships."

06:02.071 --> 06:03.654
Rocket ships.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.949
Mmm!

06:06.993 --> 06:08.701
There!

06:16.794 --> 06:19.253
"Hey, Scrooge,
it's me, Della."

06:19.297 --> 06:20.880
I'm alive on the moon.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.965
Send help. And snacks.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.091
This gum is the worst.

06:24.135 --> 06:25.885
"Sincerely, Della."

06:25.928 --> 06:27.177
Perfect!

06:32.602 --> 06:33.602
Oh, no!

06:35.146 --> 06:36.146
Unh!

06:42.069 --> 06:43.444
Well, that was unnecessary.

06:57.752 --> 07:00.210
Oh! Not enough scraps
for a full "S.O.S."

07:00.254 --> 07:03.589
Need something that will
get Scrooge's attention.

07:06.928 --> 07:08.543
Nailed it!

07:28.908 --> 07:31.784
Oh. Uhh... uhh... uhh.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.328
<i>I'm sorry I can't be there
for your first birthday,</i>

07:34.372 --> 07:35.372
<i>but I am trying.</i>

07:37.124 --> 07:39.541
<i>Do not mess with me today,
Moon Mite!</i>

07:47.343 --> 07:48.676
<i>Forget cake!</i>

07:48.719 --> 07:50.280
<i>Guess what you're getting
for your birthday?</i>

07:50.304 --> 07:52.596
<i>Your mom!</i>

07:52.640 --> 07:55.891
Hey! Get away from there!
Let's make a deal...

07:55.935 --> 07:57.579
You leave my S.O.S. alone
for, like, ten seconds,

07:57.603 --> 07:59.561
and once I'm off
this stupid rock,

07:59.605 --> 08:00.270
you can eat
my whole dang ship!

08:00.314 --> 08:01.647
Eh? Ehhh?!

08:05.778 --> 08:07.277
...Ohhh!

08:07.321 --> 08:08.862
Aah!

08:08.906 --> 08:09.906
Ahh!

08:12.243 --> 08:15.244
Let! It! Goooo!

08:15.287 --> 08:17.121
Oof!

08:23.671 --> 08:25.671
This is Space Eagle
to McDuck HQ.

08:25.715 --> 08:29.008
Looks like some kind of meteor
strike on the surface.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.411
There are
no visible signs of life.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.770
- Aah!

08:45.943 --> 08:46.943
Unh!

08:48.362 --> 08:50.779
No! Wait! Come back!

08:50.823 --> 08:51.989
Unh!

09:02.001 --> 09:04.209
Okay. New plan.

09:07.757 --> 09:10.966
<i>I'm gonna rebuild
the Spear of Selene!</i>

09:11.010 --> 09:13.469
<i>I mean, how hard can it be?
It's just rocket science.</i>

09:13.512 --> 09:14.595
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

09:16.390 --> 09:17.598
Focus, Della!

09:17.641 --> 09:19.641
Like Donald always says,
do things by the book.

09:25.191 --> 09:29.234
Aah! Aaaaaah!

09:29.278 --> 09:31.236
Puh! Puh!

09:31.280 --> 09:33.864
Good thing Donald's not here.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.164
Whoa! Oh!

09:42.208 --> 09:43.582
Ohhh!

09:46.128 --> 09:47.628
Uhhhhh!

09:54.428 --> 09:55.511
Ah!

10:04.939 --> 10:05.939
Ta-da!

10:29.839 --> 10:33.006
<i>Okay, it took...
a while,</i>

10:33.050 --> 10:34.967
<i>but I finally did it.</i>

10:35.010 --> 10:37.928
<i>I rebuilt the Spear of Selene!</i>

10:42.101 --> 10:42.766
All right, I just gotta
start this baby up,

10:42.810 --> 10:44.184
and I'm on my way home!

10:57.908 --> 10:59.241
Aaah!

10:59.285 --> 11:00.576
Unh!

11:03.080 --> 11:04.080
Come on!

11:04.123 --> 11:06.540
"Turn key."

11:06.584 --> 11:07.916
Yeah. No duh, book!

11:09.712 --> 11:11.962
Rrrrr!

11:12.006 --> 11:13.589
<i>It wasn't enough
that Gyro created</i>

11:13.632 --> 11:15.007
<i>the most disgusting
flavor of gum</i>

11:15.050 --> 11:17.718
<i>that somehow gets
more flavorful as you chew it,</i>

11:17.761 --> 11:19.521
<i>but then he had to use
his stupid Gold Tech</i>

11:19.555 --> 11:22.097
<i>to make the engine run!</i>

11:22.141 --> 11:24.591
<i>How am I gonna find stinkin'
gold on the stinkin' moon?!</i>

11:24.602 --> 11:27.269
<i>Unh!</i>

11:27.313 --> 11:29.980
<i>Okay, I spent 20 years</i>

11:30.024 --> 11:31.784
<i>with the best treasure hunter
in the world.</i>

11:32.818 --> 11:34.943
<i>If there's gold on this rock,</i>

11:38.115 --> 11:39.489
<i>I'm gonna find it.</i>

11:39.533 --> 11:42.075
Hup! Ah! Hup!

11:42.119 --> 11:43.119
...Hup!

11:44.205 --> 11:45.746
Hup!

11:45.789 --> 11:46.955
Hup!

11:51.545 --> 11:53.045
Welp, there's
no gold on the moon.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.296
"Tear me tartan,"

11:54.340 --> 11:55.650
I'm the richest duck
in the world,

11:55.674 --> 11:58.967
but I couldn't possibly spare
any back-up gold,

11:59.011 --> 12:01.428
"even though the engine
runs on it."

12:01.472 --> 12:04.181
Life lesson, kids:
adventuring is tough.

12:04.225 --> 12:06.516
...Ya know, sometimes
there's a cursed idol

12:06.560 --> 12:08.727
that turns into a demon.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.562
Or sometimes you
crash land on the moon

12:10.606 --> 12:11.688
and try to stay alive,

12:11.732 --> 12:13.232
but a Moon Mite
messes everything up,

12:13.275 --> 12:15.984
keeping you here while your
kids grow up with their uncles.

12:16.028 --> 12:20.656
But you still got your health,
a cool robot leg,

12:20.699 --> 12:22.616
and gum that mocks you
with every chew!

12:22.660 --> 12:25.244
Ow!

12:25.287 --> 12:27.788
A gold filling?!

12:27.831 --> 12:29.915
Ah! Ha ha ha!

12:29.959 --> 12:32.209
I had gold in my mouth
this whole time!

12:32.253 --> 12:34.378
I had gold
in my mouth this whole time?!

12:34.421 --> 12:38.298
That's why Scrooge made me
go to the dentist as a kid.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.008
It wasn't
about hygiene at all!

12:40.052 --> 12:41.593
I've got back-up gold!

12:41.637 --> 12:43.178
Nothing can stop me now!

12:48.727 --> 12:50.102
No-no-no-no!
Not this time!

12:54.441 --> 12:55.607
Huh? Aah!

12:55.651 --> 12:57.901
Unh! Unh!

13:13.002 --> 13:14.209
Aaah!

13:23.804 --> 13:25.429
Ha ha!

13:25.472 --> 13:27.055
Aah! Aah!

13:27.099 --> 13:28.099
Oh!

13:30.519 --> 13:31.560
- Aah! Ohh!

13:40.279 --> 13:41.737
Huh?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.822
Halt in name of the Moon!

13:43.866 --> 13:45.615
Wait, what? Who? What?!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.039
Oh, no, you don't!

13:52.082 --> 13:54.875
Don't ignore me
when I threaten your life!

13:54.918 --> 13:56.001
Respect my dominance!

14:03.510 --> 14:05.677
Who are you
and how did you get here?!

14:05.721 --> 14:07.282
Hi! Della Duck. I have,
like, 13 million questions!

14:07.306 --> 14:10.724
But right now, I have to get
my ship and get back to Earth!

14:10.768 --> 14:12.008
Stand down,
Lieutenant Penumbra.

14:13.354 --> 14:15.312
Greetings, Earther.

14:15.356 --> 14:18.523
I am General Lunaris
of the Planet Moon.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.941
What?
The moon's not a planet.

14:19.985 --> 14:24.237
You will treat the vastly
superior Moon with respect,

14:24.281 --> 14:26.740
or you will suffer
the ultimate consequence.

14:26.784 --> 14:27.491
Look, I'll suffer
whatever consequences you want

14:27.534 --> 14:28.909
after I find the mite.

14:28.952 --> 14:32.037
Uh, ha. The courageous
warriors of the Planet Moon

14:32.081 --> 14:35.540
have been hunting the beast
for more than three cycles.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.835
So how exactly is a pathetic
Earth-dwelling dummy going to find it?

14:41.215 --> 14:42.464
Unh!

14:45.344 --> 14:46.344
Unh!

14:58.023 --> 14:59.023
Ohh!

15:00.818 --> 15:01.983
Hey, I found the mite!

15:06.281 --> 15:07.906
Open fire,
Lieutenant Penumbra!

15:10.369 --> 15:11.576
...Oh!

15:14.206 --> 15:15.747
Quick! Feed the Earther
to the beast!

15:15.791 --> 15:18.500
While it's crushing
her weak bones, we kill it!

15:18.544 --> 15:20.752
Listen, we both know
how this goes:

15:20.796 --> 15:22.587
first we hate each other,

15:22.631 --> 15:24.150
then go on a life-changing
adventure, then...

15:24.174 --> 15:25.174
- Boom!

15:26.552 --> 15:28.093
Best friends!

15:28.137 --> 15:29.469
So can we move
this along, Penny?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.224
My name
is Lieutenant Penumbra!

15:41.191 --> 15:42.232
Huh!

15:54.246 --> 15:57.038
Aaaaah! Uhhh!

15:57.082 --> 15:58.790
Aaaaah!

16:01.253 --> 16:02.294
Stop firing, Lieutenant.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.337
You'll hit Della.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.068
You won't stop me
from getting home to my kids,

16:07.092 --> 16:09.092
ya creepy-crawly crook!

16:09.136 --> 16:10.260
Rraah!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.934
I will not fail them again!

16:17.978 --> 16:19.144
Aaah!

16:33.118 --> 16:34.118
Yah!

16:37.206 --> 16:39.122
Aaaah!

16:56.850 --> 16:58.975
Wait.
The mite isn't a monster.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.644
It's a mother!

17:00.687 --> 17:01.978
Who cares?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.730
The mite isn't our enemy.

17:03.774 --> 17:07.067
It's just trying
to survive.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.109
She put herself in danger,

17:09.154 --> 17:10.444
faced unknown threats,

17:10.489 --> 17:14.281
scoured this entire planet
for any scrap of metal.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.247
Because a mother
would do anything

17:20.290 --> 17:21.373
for the sake of her kids.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.250
Ah... mmph!

18:06.503 --> 18:09.296
Let me try something.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.567
I used to sing
this old song to my boys

18:10.591 --> 18:13.341
before they hatched.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.801
Quick,
give me your guns.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.054
Ooh, good plan.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.181
Lull the beasts
into a false sense of security

19:01.224 --> 19:03.808
only to betray them when they're
at their most vulnerable!

19:03.852 --> 19:05.477
Huh, maybe we <i> are</i>
becoming best friends.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.406
Boo! You disappoint me
in every way possible!

19:37.630 --> 19:39.761
We fought the mites
for cycles,

19:39.805 --> 19:43.973
and you turned them back, not
through battle, but compassion.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.017
If we
simply share the gold,

19:46.061 --> 19:47.705
we will no longer be
at war with the beasts.

19:47.729 --> 19:51.648
You have done the Planet Moon a
great service today, Della Duck.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.037
There's no way
I can fix this.

20:06.081 --> 20:09.332
Sorry, boys. I tried.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.752
You might not be able
to go home,

20:12.796 --> 20:14.315
but that doesn't mean
you can't make a new one,

20:14.339 --> 20:15.380
with us.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.648
For too long, the mites have
been attacking our home,

20:33.692 --> 20:35.400
but my people
will hide in fear no more.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.946
Neat house. Huh.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.115
Where I'm from,
we call this a "rock."

20:42.159 --> 20:43.959
General, am I allowed
to disintegrate her yet?

20:55.422 --> 20:56.422
Wha...?!

21:00.719 --> 21:03.928
Welcome to Tranquility.

21:03.972 --> 21:08.558
Wait. This whole time
there's been a city here?!

21:08.602 --> 21:10.163
And I've been slumming it
in the moon desert?!

21:10.187 --> 21:12.312
I told you
you were a dummy.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.481
And you guys had food,
and weapons and...

21:17.486 --> 21:18.943
gold!

21:18.987 --> 21:21.905
It's
our most plentiful resource.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.072
We use it for everything.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.699
Sometimes we just throw it
in the trash,

21:24.743 --> 21:26.034
which is also made of gold.

21:26.077 --> 21:30.914
Wow. That is incredibly
infuriating, but amazing!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.791
Ha ha ha ha!
I can fix my ship!

21:32.834 --> 21:36.336
Your attempts to wrestle me
to the ground are pathetic!

21:36.379 --> 21:39.339
See? Best friends!

21:41.218 --> 21:42.361
I can't believe
you're just going

21:42.385 --> 21:43.571
to let that Moon-hater
run free.

21:43.595 --> 21:45.136
You've gone Earth soft.

21:45.180 --> 21:48.973
That Earth-dweller managed
to defeat our greatest enemy

21:49.017 --> 21:50.350
like it was nothing.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.393
She could be useful.

21:53.897 --> 21:55.396
Or dangerous.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.108
Watch your back, Earther.
