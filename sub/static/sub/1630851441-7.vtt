WEBVTT

00:08.341 --> 00:09.926
I want to locate someone.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.636
You get me what I need,
I'll get you your pyramid back.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.179
And the capstone.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.848
Previously on
"The Lost Symbol..."

00:14.889 --> 00:17.183
Three years ago,
Zachary Solomon was

00:17.225 --> 00:18.727
beaten to death in Turkey.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.062
Intel points to this prisoner
as Zachary's killer.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.522
He left this.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.649
-Did you know my brother?
-He was smart.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.485
Raw intellect can only
get you so far.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.404
Raw intellect can
only get you so far.

00:29.446 --> 00:33.074
-Stop!
-Wait. No, it's Zachary.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.493
Zachary.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.349
The architecture of this
building is inspired

00:57.390 --> 01:00.810
by the tomb
of King Mausolus

01:00.852 --> 01:02.103
in Halicarnassus.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.398
Which is a country
now known as...

01:05.440 --> 01:08.777
-Turkey.
-Yes, indeed.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.072
This room is a kaleidoscope
of culture;

01:12.113 --> 01:15.784
Egyptian, Hebraic,

01:15.825 --> 01:18.661
astronomical, alchemical,

01:18.703 --> 01:21.790
all accessible only
to the 33rd degree.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.335
How do you get to that?
The 33rd degree.

01:25.377 --> 01:29.547
Years of commitment
and charitable works.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.342
But why?

01:32.384 --> 01:33.968
What's the point of it all?

01:34.010 --> 01:36.638
Brotherhood.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.307
Like minds in lockstep pursuit

01:39.349 --> 01:42.102
of great wisdom.

01:42.143 --> 01:45.855
Why do you need a brotherhood
when you have a family?

01:51.194 --> 01:54.280
You'll understand one day,
Zachary,

01:54.322 --> 01:58.201
when it's your turn to
begin that climb.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.306
Dad?

02:20.348 --> 02:24.853
This is a list that I've put
together of some specialists.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.105
-They all come very highly...
-I said I didn't want this.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.026
You said you didn't want to
talk to me, and that's fine.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.485
I just--

02:32.527 --> 02:34.070
You know, what's the harm in
seeing someone?

02:34.112 --> 02:39.909
Carl Jung said some wounds
are unhealable.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.251
Would you stay with him?
I just need a minute.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.754
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.550
Jung also said,
"We don't get wounded alone,

02:55.592 --> 02:58.470
and we don't heal alone."

02:58.511 --> 03:00.513
You told me that once.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.350
I used to lecture to
a lot of people

03:03.391 --> 03:06.728
about things
I thought were right.

03:06.770 --> 03:11.191
You know, when Zachary
was a young boy,

03:11.232 --> 03:13.526
he used to make me

03:13.568 --> 03:17.572
sit beside his bed every night

03:17.614 --> 03:22.577
as he went to sleep,
holding my hand.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.913
You were a good father, Peter.

03:30.126 --> 03:34.172
"If thy right hand offend thee,
cut it off."

03:34.214 --> 03:37.717
Mark,43.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.970
It's what he recited...

03:41.012 --> 03:43.431
when he sawed it off.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.976
The hand he used to hold.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.981
How did my boy
become that...

03:54.109 --> 03:56.736
...monster?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.102
We are preservationists...

05:11.144 --> 05:15.482
sworn to guard what's
best left undisturbed.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.152
Men of our word.

05:19.194 --> 05:23.740
But you've made a bargain you
have yet to keep.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.867
The pyramid and capstone.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.535
I don't know what to tell you.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.747
Mal'akh had them and took
a header off a cliff.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.084
Without him, your best bet is to
start combing the Potomac.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.920
And with him?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.888
I told you, he's gone.
Dead, maybe.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.098
No.

05:50.809 --> 05:51.976
Not dead.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.000
From darkness to light.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.001
The Leviathan membership
includes connections

06:58.043 --> 07:00.420
to a certain
security contractor firm.

07:00.462 --> 07:04.007
We've deployed those resources
and brought him in.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.217
Why?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.719
I told you.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.929
We want the artifacts.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
But he isn't talking.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.935
In fact, he said
he'll talk only to you.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.356
Go ahead.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.524
He's sedated.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.069
He'll behave.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.942
Sato.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.195
Zachary.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.700
Is that who you see?

08:13.827 --> 08:16.287
Or who you wish you did?

08:19.082 --> 08:21.418
You left him in prison.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.879
A lost boy
with a belief in nothing

08:24.921 --> 08:27.966
but his own limitations.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.761
Beaten...

08:31.803 --> 08:34.180
within an inch of his life.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.811
What he discovered...

08:39.853 --> 08:41.813
in that inch...

08:41.855 --> 08:44.107
was his true potential.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.276
You American or Canadian,
Zachary?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.210
You got a lot of fans.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.005
Half the prison, the guards.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.424
I help keep things quiet here.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.260
When something comes along
making too much noise,

10:35.301 --> 10:38.138
I silence it.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.765
What does it mean to you?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.812
It's an owl.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.314
I don't know.

10:48.356 --> 10:51.151
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.780
The owl is the harbinger.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.074
A symbol of death, ruin

10:58.116 --> 11:00.535
and transformation.

11:00.577 --> 11:05.540
What you mark upon the body is
an invocation of power...

11:05.582 --> 11:07.584
or self-destruction.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.089
Sorry, it's just I get, uh...

11:13.131 --> 11:14.591
all of the symbolic,

11:14.632 --> 11:19.429
quasi-spiritual bullshit
I can handle from my father.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.182
And what does he believe in?

11:22.974 --> 11:25.226
Everything but me.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.606
He's a Freemason.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.901
It's the pursuit of knowledge,

11:32.942 --> 11:36.446
ancient mysteries,
untapped potential...

11:37.989 --> 11:41.159
And a great wisdom that
will reveal man's highest self.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.372
I, too, believe this.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.792
Well...

11:48.833 --> 11:51.336
enjoy the Kool-Aid.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.968
I like you, Zachary.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.972
I think we were meant to meet.

12:08.144 --> 12:11.106
But you are a noisy thing.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.714
We have to get you out of here.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.382
You had your chance!

12:53.273 --> 12:54.941
Oh.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.120
I wouldn't have
even recognized him.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.125
He's dressed in rags.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.918
He's so thin.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.670
Don't they feed him?

13:15.712 --> 13:16.588
Of course they do.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.214
Dad, you didn't see him.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.551
He's broken.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.428
-Isabel...

13:31.353 --> 13:32.896
Dad, we have to do something.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.189
Yes.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.191
I will speak to Warren

13:36.232 --> 13:37.901
and see what
the State Department can do

13:37.942 --> 13:39.986
about securing his release.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.488
That could mean months
of red tape.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.073
That is diplomacy.
It takes time.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.158
He may not have time.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.661
Kat may have another solution.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.584
I may know someone with a
contact at the Justice Ministry.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.505
Money will move this faster
than the State Department.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
Absolutely not.

14:00.298 --> 14:01.925
Bribery is reckless.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.094
It can backfire
and it is immoral.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.428
They broke his feet, Dad,

14:05.470 --> 14:07.138
so please don't lecture me
on morality.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.848
I'm trying to do
what is right here.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.684
-For whom?
-For everyone.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.646
Peter, Kat's seen the situation
with her own eyes.

14:14.688 --> 14:18.316
A backchannel may be the only
thing to save Zach in time.

14:20.985 --> 14:23.738
I will run it by Warren.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.199
Off the record.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.784
I need to get some air.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.994
Robert, will you walk with me?

14:32.831 --> 14:34.457
Sure.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.732
Is that your wife who was here?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.489
Sister.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.666
And is she like your father?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.918
This man who believes
in untapped potential

15:18.960 --> 15:21.129
yet cannot see yours?

15:21.921 --> 15:25.550
Look what they did to me.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.434
It's hard for you to understand,

15:34.476 --> 15:37.687
but this was a necessary part
of your journey.

15:40.857 --> 15:43.026
Let me take your pain.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.757
What are you doing?

16:21.106 --> 16:23.191
What's happening?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.376
Today...

16:41.418 --> 16:43.795
your healing begins.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.977
Your support
for Katherine back there

16:59.019 --> 17:01.688
was very touching.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.274
I don't want to get
between you two.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.943
Thankfully, you already are.

17:06.985 --> 17:09.821
I used to worry
you two wouldn't be able

17:09.863 --> 17:13.450
to get over your differences,
but I was wrong.

17:15.744 --> 17:20.290
A man is allowed
to be wrong sometimes.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.417
Isn't he?

17:24.044 --> 17:27.630
This family could do
with some good news right now.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.593
So what are you waiting for?

17:32.510 --> 17:34.971
You have the ring, don't you?

17:36.514 --> 17:39.267
-A lot going on, obviously.
-What did I tell you

17:39.309 --> 17:41.186
about the timing of things?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.647
You know, you could be waiting
for the rest of your life.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.817
Maybe I think too much.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.445
What-what if I'm not there
for her?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.739
What if I'm not...

17:54.491 --> 17:57.494
What if I'm no better
than my dad?

17:57.535 --> 17:59.621
You know, Jung wrote:

17:59.662 --> 18:01.623
"We don't get wounded alone

18:01.664 --> 18:04.376
and we don't heal alone."

18:04.417 --> 18:08.672
I just think Kate would be
a wonderful woman to heal with.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.336
How does it feel?

18:50.797 --> 18:54.467
I broke my hand in high school
punching a wall.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.761
Took months to heal.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.391
I don't know how you did this.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.685
But I want to.

19:10.483 --> 19:13.903
Could you show me?

19:13.945 --> 19:15.613
No.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.534
Why not?

19:25.540 --> 19:28.710
"Man's highest self," huh?

19:31.713 --> 19:33.757
Zachary.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.972
The ability you seek...

19:43.433 --> 19:46.144
...it does not come freely.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.740
What do I have to do?

20:02.494 --> 20:05.705
My childhood was a lecture.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.958
Always the student,
never the son.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.129
Your father was
the wrong teacher.

20:13.171 --> 20:17.092
You have yet to learn
your power.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.053
How?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.390
Commit.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.184
Embody your commitment
in every action,

20:26.226 --> 20:29.771
every thought,
every inch of your flesh.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.902
You must sacrifice your past.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.904
You must erase who you were

20:37.946 --> 20:40.448
in order to write
who you will become.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.129
Burn it, Zachary.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.674
I want you to burn it all.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.718
All the mistakes you have made.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.345
And all the mistakes
others have made against you.

21:03.138 --> 21:07.434
All of your memories,
judgments, inhibitions.

21:07.475 --> 21:10.186
Burn for me,
and I will teach you.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.170
Thank you.

21:40.008 --> 21:42.677
Apparently,
the duck here is great.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.306
Can't see any duck, though.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.974
Is this the right place?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.809
Well, they checked
the reservation and greeted you

21:49.851 --> 21:51.978
by name, so I think chances are.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.313
Right.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.814
Right. Of course.
Thank you.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.154
What's going on with you?

22:03.198 --> 22:04.699
Is there something
you're not telling me?

22:04.741 --> 22:06.743
No. I mean...

22:08.036 --> 22:09.621
...yes.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.332
Katherine...

22:12.374 --> 22:14.709
I've been thinking, uh,

22:14.751 --> 22:17.462
-about the future...
-I got it.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.297
I-I would say yes,
if I were you.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.842
If you were me?

22:22.884 --> 22:24.511
You mean Oxford, right?

22:24.552 --> 22:25.845
Or are you fielding job offers

22:25.887 --> 22:28.348
from multiple
world-class universities?

22:28.390 --> 22:29.349
Yeah.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.184
I mean, uh, no, just that offer.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.769
But...

22:32.811 --> 22:35.313
I'm not going.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.065
I said no.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.400
It's fine.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.193
I-I mean, it's good.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.569
You're starting the lab,

22:41.611 --> 22:43.697
and I get to be there for that,
for you.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.865
I don't want you making
a decision because of me

22:45.907 --> 22:47.784
that you might regret later on.

22:48.576 --> 22:51.746
-The only thing
that I'd regret...
-Any questions on the menu?

22:51.788 --> 22:53.206
-Um...
-No, I-I think we're good.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.041
-Thanks.
-So, for tonight's special,

22:55.083 --> 22:57.043
we have a delicious
lemon soy branzino

22:57.085 --> 22:59.921
served with roasted cauliflower
and a lovely chateaubriand.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.924
Um, and the chateaubriand,

23:02.966 --> 23:05.719
-is that for one or two?
-Oh. There's a call.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.262
Oh, wow. So sorry.

23:07.303 --> 23:08.847
-I-I got to take this.
-Are you actually faking

23:08.888 --> 23:10.390
-a phone call right now?
-Hello?

23:11.683 --> 23:12.934
You are. Okay.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.020
Um...

23:15.812 --> 23:17.313
Uh...

23:17.355 --> 23:20.025
-I think we're just gonna
need a minute.
-Sure.

23:21.818 --> 23:25.113
Okay, what's the problem
this time, Robert?

23:25.947 --> 23:27.741
Well, for one, you're a fool,

23:27.782 --> 23:29.868
and she's not gonna marry
a fool.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.412
maybe she would--
you'll never know,

23:32.454 --> 23:34.539
'cause you're a scared fool.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.677
Kat.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.095
What's wrong?

23:51.598 --> 23:53.933
"However, speculation
amongst long-time observers

23:53.975 --> 23:55.268
"of the region believe

23:55.310 --> 23:57.187
"the imprisonment
of the younger Solomon

23:57.228 --> 24:01.191
"raises the specter of Turkey's
dubious evidentiary standards

24:01.232 --> 24:03.610
and questionable
human rights record."

24:03.651 --> 24:05.570
Needless to say,
Zachary's situation

24:05.612 --> 24:07.697
has just become...

24:07.739 --> 24:10.241
more complicated.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.328
"The Turkish Justice Ministry
said that the full list

24:13.370 --> 24:16.956
of charges and evidence
would be released in due time."

24:16.998 --> 24:18.958
You were going
to keep this out of the press.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.669
I tried.

24:20.710 --> 24:23.004
Perhaps they got wind
of your visit.

24:23.046 --> 24:25.048
So now this is my fault?

24:25.090 --> 24:26.925
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.218
The story has embarrassed
the Turkish government,

24:28.259 --> 24:30.679
and now they want
their pound of flesh.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.430
What do you mean?

24:32.472 --> 24:36.810
They have demanded that
Zachary make a public apology

24:36.851 --> 24:38.937
and full confession
to the drug charges

24:38.978 --> 24:41.606
and of espionage.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.149
-What?
-That's ridiculous.

24:43.191 --> 24:47.445
Yes, but that is the only way
they will let him go now.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.781
What if he won't do it?

24:50.573 --> 24:52.701
Well, he has to.

24:53.493 --> 24:55.537
Have you told Mom about this?

24:55.578 --> 24:57.831
No.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.211
I didn't think
that would be a good idea.

25:15.140 --> 25:19.853
The body is a canvas,
capable of great manifestation.

25:36.619 --> 25:38.955
What does it mean?

25:38.997 --> 25:42.917
Breithe, bás, athbhreithe.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.796
Birth, death...

25:46.838 --> 25:49.257
and rebirth.

25:51.217 --> 25:55.889
Birth, death and rebirth.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.988
-Focus on the hum.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.991
-Its vibrations.

26:35.011 --> 26:39.057
Resonance opens channels
within us, tapping into energies

26:39.099 --> 26:42.310
that allow us to master control
of our bodies.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.794
Concentrate on the vibration,

27:07.836 --> 27:10.171
then push against it.

27:49.711 --> 27:53.506
I believe you're ready for
the next stage of your journey.

27:54.966 --> 27:57.427
But it will not be here.

27:58.219 --> 28:00.221
Beneath this prison,

28:00.263 --> 28:03.933
there's a waterway that connects
to the basilica near Ayasofya.

28:03.975 --> 28:06.186
There, the aqueduct dries
into a tunnel

28:06.227 --> 28:08.271
that runs beneath the museum,

28:08.313 --> 28:11.649
where we will surface
and escape.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.904
-Escape?
-I've set in motion a plan here.

28:15.945 --> 28:18.656
This place will descend
into chaos.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.784
It will allow us to run.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.869
Travel away.

28:22.911 --> 28:25.747
Then...

28:25.789 --> 28:29.376
you will get something for me
from your father.

28:30.377 --> 28:31.836
Why?

28:31.878 --> 28:33.755
What could you want from him?

28:33.797 --> 28:36.841
The Knights Templar once stole
an ancient wisdom

28:36.883 --> 28:38.885
from this land.

28:38.927 --> 28:42.764
A set of psychic commandments
which, once learned,

28:42.806 --> 28:45.684
can transform man into god.

28:46.476 --> 28:50.397
From the Templars, it
changed hands to the Freemasons.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.065
Your father's brotherhood
has something

28:52.107 --> 28:54.651
that does not belong to them.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.500
Zachary.

29:17.632 --> 29:20.051
It's good to see you.

29:26.182 --> 29:29.144
Looks like your feet
have healed up.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.396
That's good.

29:32.397 --> 29:34.149
It is.

29:42.574 --> 29:45.618
I suppose you're wondering
why I'm here.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.455
Was that a prompt?

29:48.496 --> 29:52.042
Am I supposed to hazard a guess?

29:52.834 --> 29:56.212
Warren has negotiated
an agreement for your release,

29:56.254 --> 29:59.174
to come home.

29:59.966 --> 30:02.302
This is home.

30:03.094 --> 30:05.055
There are conditions.

30:05.096 --> 30:06.639
You have to make
a full confession

30:06.681 --> 30:09.684
-to some other charges...
-You don't listen.

30:11.269 --> 30:13.646
You never did.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.982
I don't need your deal.

30:16.024 --> 30:18.443
I made a mistake.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.702
I made a mistake.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.038
You want to punish me?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.749
All right, I deserve it.

30:32.791 --> 30:35.293
But it isn't just for me.

30:36.211 --> 30:39.089
It's your sister.

30:39.130 --> 30:41.383
It's for your mother.

30:42.217 --> 30:44.719
She just sits by the window
most days,

30:44.761 --> 30:46.763
tearing at her hair.

30:46.805 --> 30:49.391
Your family needs you back.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.686
Come home.

30:55.647 --> 30:58.233
Please come home.

31:22.132 --> 31:24.259
Mom, what are you doing?

31:25.760 --> 31:29.097
We could never get him
to believe in the tooth fairy.

31:32.100 --> 31:34.060
After his first tooth,

31:34.102 --> 31:37.313
even then he saw
right through it.

31:44.529 --> 31:47.699
Dad's gonna bring him home.

31:48.491 --> 31:51.202
You're so quick
to believe in your father.

31:53.246 --> 31:56.458
That's how all this started,
isn't it?

31:59.252 --> 32:01.087
Let's get some air.
It's nice outside.

32:01.129 --> 32:02.756
No, I'm fine, honey.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.883
You go ahead.

32:31.993 --> 32:35.580
Vibrations will only manifest
if you commit.

32:36.498 --> 32:39.292
And you are not there yet.

32:46.675 --> 32:50.303
You thought I wouldn't hear
about the deal your father made?

32:51.513 --> 32:54.724
He still controls you,
just as he always has.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.978
No.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.940
He doesn't control me.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.150
Do you really believe that?

33:04.192 --> 33:06.277
-He manipulated you.
-No.

33:06.319 --> 33:07.779
He made you do what he wanted,

33:07.821 --> 33:09.572
because you're
still not free of him.

33:09.614 --> 33:12.617
If I go back,
I can be more useful.

33:12.659 --> 33:17.205
Through him,
I can find the ancient wisdom.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.212
You must find yourself first.

33:27.298 --> 33:29.175
It's begun.

33:30.927 --> 33:34.723
Today we both escape.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.022
Breithe,

33:42.063 --> 33:44.649
bás, athbhreithe.

34:04.961 --> 34:06.546
Yeah?

35:48.398 --> 35:50.608
Will you commit?

35:53.236 --> 35:56.031
You must erase who you were
in order to write

35:56.072 --> 35:58.074
who you will become.

37:43.221 --> 37:45.473
Hey.

37:45.515 --> 37:47.642
-Hey.
-Sorry. Little early.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.185
No, it's fine.

37:55.233 --> 37:56.484
What are you doing?

37:56.526 --> 37:57.861
I don't know.

37:59.654 --> 38:02.407
Trying to feel him, I guess.

38:02.449 --> 38:04.325
There's nothing.

38:04.367 --> 38:06.619
No difference.

38:08.246 --> 38:10.206
Like he's still here.

38:11.041 --> 38:15.045
It's normal to not accept
the reality of death.

38:15.086 --> 38:16.671
I'm sure it feels impossible...

38:16.713 --> 38:18.423
No, that's not what I mean.

38:18.465 --> 38:21.885
I just have this feeling,
this...

38:23.720 --> 38:25.638
...this sense.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.892
I envy you, you know.

38:30.393 --> 38:32.854
How black and white the world
must seem through your eyes.

38:35.982 --> 38:38.109
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm sorry.

38:38.151 --> 38:41.654
I'm sorry. I'm not...
I'm not angry with you.

38:41.696 --> 38:44.240
I'm angry with myself.

38:44.282 --> 38:46.284
Zach was right.

38:47.786 --> 38:49.746
I could have done more.

38:51.623 --> 38:55.210
I didn't do more...

38:55.251 --> 38:58.880
because I didn't trust myself
to do it.

38:59.631 --> 39:01.633
I turned to Dad.

39:01.675 --> 39:04.010
I turned to you.

39:04.052 --> 39:06.388
Why didn't I turn to myself?

39:06.429 --> 39:07.889
I'm...

39:07.931 --> 39:10.934
more than capable.

39:15.397 --> 39:18.149
If I can't trust myself, I...

39:20.694 --> 39:23.738
...I'm not ready to trust
somebody else.

39:24.572 --> 39:27.325
Kat, please, can we just...

39:27.367 --> 39:29.077
I can't do this.

39:29.119 --> 39:32.956
It wouldn't be fair to you
or to me.

39:32.997 --> 39:35.083
I need to do this alone.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.794
I have to figure out my way
through this.

39:37.836 --> 39:40.130
We figure it out together.

39:43.258 --> 39:44.634
I love you...

39:44.676 --> 39:46.219
Robert Langdon.

39:46.261 --> 39:47.762
And I wish you

39:47.804 --> 39:52.475
every good thing imaginable
at Oxford or...

39:52.517 --> 39:54.978
wherever you end up.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.897
'Cause I just know
the most incredible future

39:57.939 --> 40:00.608
-is waiting for you.
-No. Kat...

40:00.650 --> 40:02.819
I just can't be a part of it.

41:06.466 --> 41:08.385
Hello.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.986
What do you think?

41:28.154 --> 41:31.366
It will require
several surgeries.

41:31.408 --> 41:33.076
Very expensive.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.370
You'll get your money.

41:35.412 --> 41:38.998
I'll need a photo from before
for reference.

41:42.544 --> 41:44.754
There is no before.

43:44.207 --> 43:46.584
Zachary.

43:47.794 --> 43:50.547
I told you.

43:51.881 --> 43:55.010
He's gone.

43:55.802 --> 43:58.013
No.

43:58.054 --> 44:01.683
It feels like you can't go back,

44:01.725 --> 44:04.227
but it's not too late.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.897
And what choice
would you have me make?

44:07.939 --> 44:12.610
Start by telling me where you
put the pyramid and capstone.

44:12.652 --> 44:15.572
So the CIA could have them?

44:16.740 --> 44:19.492
So you can live.

44:23.204 --> 44:26.875
After all that I've done...

44:26.916 --> 44:29.169
you would want that?

44:50.607 --> 44:52.609
They're buried.

44:53.818 --> 44:57.364
Near a bridge at the edge
of the Solomon property.

44:59.949 --> 45:02.160
Zachary's bridge.

45:07.749 --> 45:09.709
My bridge.

45:15.674 --> 45:18.468
I'll let them know.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.888
You're leaving?

45:21.930 --> 45:23.640
No.

45:24.766 --> 45:27.143
I'll come back this time.

46:14.190 --> 46:17.819
You think he's gonna be okay?

46:17.861 --> 46:20.572
He's got you, doesn't he?

46:22.615 --> 46:24.701
And me.

46:30.999 --> 46:33.668
I'm not going anywhere
this time.

47:45.240 --> 47:46.700
They're buried.

47:46.741 --> 47:50.036
Near a bridge at the edge
of the Solomon property.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.871
Zachary's bridge.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.626
My bridge.

49:25.215 --> 49:27.676
Breithe...

49:27.717 --> 49:29.344
bás...

49:29.386 --> 49:31.805
athbhreithe.
