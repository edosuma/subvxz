00:02.303 --> 00:04.436
Oh, man, I can't
believe we have

00:04.438 --> 00:05.437
to pick the peaches
ourselves.

00:05.439 --> 00:10.442
This activity is so lame I'm
gonna daydream about school.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.212
Damn it, a pop quiz!

00:13.214 --> 00:15.714
Aw, come on, Bart, it's fun!

00:16.050 --> 00:19.385
Well, that was kind of the same
as the first time.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.487
Oh! Why did I suggest this?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.722
Peach pickin' ain't so bad,
long as you got

00:23.724 --> 00:25.524
a song to take
your mind off it.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.360
Ooh, authentic
American folk music,

00:28.362 --> 00:30.596

00:30.598 --> 00:32.297
I'm afraid the only "NPR"

for doing this?

01:13.107 --> 01:17.076
Actually, we pay them for each
peach we take home.

01:17.078 --> 01:17.543
What the...?

01:17.545 --> 01:22.147

fruit-related topic,

01:59.854 --> 02:01.653
I booked us a
couples massage.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.288
Ooh... couples!

02:03.290 --> 02:05.591
That way I can enjoy
my massage,

yours too much.

02:16.904 --> 02:17.736
I forget what phase two is,

02:17.738 --> 02:22.307
but I'll assume we just dump
the peaches like we discussed.

02:22.309 --> 02:22.875
Affirmative.

02:22.877 --> 02:24.610
I'll assume that means "yes."

02:24.612 --> 02:25.577

the peaches will be gone.

What will we eat?!

02:47.401 --> 02:49.635
Oh... Oh!

02:49.637 --> 02:50.769
Oh, screw it.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.673
Masseuses:
the half-doctors/half-hookers

The Horticulture Society is

LISA: Help! I'm trapped in

Marvin The Magician?

04:22.329 --> 04:23.762
Oswald of the Occult?

04:23.764 --> 04:24.830
Citywide Mortgage?

04:24.832 --> 04:26.932
I worked everything out
with Nina.

04:26.934 --> 04:27.733
No one sent me.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.302
I just knocked on the
door and it opened.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.405
Uh, how'd I get from inside
there to over here?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.941
Because this
is a house of magic.

04:35.943 --> 04:39.311
Sounds like most of the house is
still owned by the bank.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.581
But the rest
of it is magic.
Ooh...

04:45.552 --> 04:48.320
(gasps)
How did you do all that?

04:48.756 --> 04:51.590
Permit me
to introduce myself.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.326
I am...
the Great Raymondo!

04:54.328 --> 04:57.863
I was once the most famous
illusionist in the world,

04:57.865 --> 05:00.432
performing for pashas
and potentates,

05:00.434 --> 05:03.669
Grand Dukes
and Grande Dames...

05:03.671 --> 05:05.103
(sighs, groans)

05:05.105 --> 05:07.739
Who wants to hear
an old man go on

05:07.741 --> 05:09.741
about bygone wonders?

05:09.743 --> 05:10.575
I do, I do!

05:10.577 --> 05:11.977
(chuckles)
Very well.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.946
But first, you should
call your parents.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.948
I got this phone
for subscribing

05:16.950 --> 05:17.783
to<i> Psychic Monthly,</i>

05:17.785 --> 05:19.951
and then I canceled
the subscription.

They never saw it coming.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.924

05:48.115 --> 05:51.550
And here, my dear, is
my most celebrated illusion:

05:51.552 --> 05:53.552
the Great
Milk Can Escape,

05:53.554 --> 05:56.755
handed down to me
by Houdini himself.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.560
Looks like there was magic
between you two.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.996
The lady in question is
my late wife Esther.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.631
She was
the only other soul

06:06.633 --> 06:08.934
who knew the secret
of my greatest trick.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.938
Now I'm alone with my memories
and my medical marijuana.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.575
Would you...
be interested in teaching me?

06:16.577 --> 06:17.909
A girl illusionist?!

06:17.911 --> 06:21.780
Ladies are what you saw
in half and throw knives at.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.515
They never wear the hat.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.584
What if you just
taught me one trick?

06:25.586 --> 06:29.054
Fine.
These are the Rings of Fate.

06:29.056 --> 06:32.691
Come back in a week with
these rings linked together,

06:32.693 --> 06:35.527
and maybe I'll--
Say, you did it already?!

06:35.529 --> 06:37.929
Well, I guess
I can teach a girl.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.498
Blackstone taught
a monkey.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.933
I'm not exactly flattered
by that.

06:41.935 --> 06:42.634
You should be.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.837
That monkey wound up
with 18 car dealerships.

06:45.839 --> 06:49.007
If you bought a family car
in the St. Louis area,

06:49.009 --> 06:52.844
you bought it
from the mighty Chimpopo.

06:52.846 --> 06:53.545
LISA:
Huh.

06:53.547 --> 06:57.549
Now, I'll start you off
with a little coin work.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.583
Ooh!

06:58.585 --> 07:02.587
And George Washington took
a trip down the...

07:02.589 --> 07:04.423
Ear-y Canal!

07:04.425 --> 07:06.758

My ear makes money?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.193
Hello, boat store?

07:08.195 --> 07:09.761
I'd like to order a boat.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.630
What do you mean, dial tone?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.599
Where'd you learn that trick,
in the Army?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.134
From the Great Raymondo.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.803
Ooh! He is great.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.972
In '57, I saw him turn the
Secretary of Agriculture

07:20.974 --> 07:24.042
into the Secretary
of the Interior!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.911
It was hell on their wives,

07:25.913 --> 07:28.780
but it sure brought down
corn prices.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.115
Built a house outta corn.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.217
Worst house I ever owned!

07:32.219 --> 07:35.720
When it got real hot,
it smelled like Fritos.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.822
Lisa can't be a magician!

07:36.824 --> 07:39.558
That's my thing!
I'm the one that got

07:39.560 --> 07:41.593
a magic set for Christmas
two years ago.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.495
You never even opened it.

07:43.497 --> 07:44.863

07:44.865 --> 07:48.099
Need some help?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.837
Kid scissors-- lame.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.638
Ooh!

Let's see what else you've been
hiding in there.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.677

07:58.679 --> 08:01.546
I want my pot of gold!

08:01.548 --> 08:04.082
Ay... ca...ram... ba!

08:04.084 --> 08:07.085
I forgot
why I'm doing this.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.721
Raymondo! I mastered
the slide pass

08:09.723 --> 08:11.923
and I've almost mastered
the Denver slide pass.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.227
And why is there always a
"Denver" version of things?

08:15.229 --> 08:17.062
I'm sorry, Lisa.

08:17.064 --> 08:17.729
I'm upset.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.998
Bumped-off-the-
Mike-Douglas-show upset!

met before, correct?

That's right,
Cregg Demon.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.194
Well, I don't need
your number, sweetie...

08:49.196 --> 08:51.796

on my ass!

08:51.798 --> 08:56.167
Yeah, it's on everyone's ass!
Yeah!

08:56.169 --> 08:57.936

08:57.938 --> 09:00.272
Eh! Disgraceful.

09:00.274 --> 09:01.907
Any idiot with a soul patch

09:01.909 --> 09:05.076
and a deck of cards
thinks he's a magician.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.547
Magic is about
mystery, illusion,

09:08.549 --> 09:10.615
pulling rabbits out of hats!

09:10.617 --> 09:12.083

I am going to teach you
the Great Milk Can Escape.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.697
You are?

10:32.699 --> 10:33.064
Why?

10:33.066 --> 10:37.836
If magic is not
passed on, it dies.

10:38.372 --> 10:43.942
The only magic we couldn't make
was a child.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.914
Now the first thing you must do
is make me a vodka tonic.

10:49.916 --> 10:50.949
You're out of tonic.

That won't be a problem.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.787
(kids murmuring)

10:55.789 --> 10:58.723
Students, teachers,
detentionees,

10:58.725 --> 11:00.825
prepare to have everything
you believe

11:00.827 --> 11:03.028
about milk cans challenged!

11:03.030 --> 11:04.729
(excited murmuring)

11:04.731 --> 11:07.098
Willie, if you will?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.870
(gasps)

11:17.010 --> 11:20.345
God, if you don't
bring my Lisa back safe,

11:20.347 --> 11:22.847
ants will burn tonight.

11:26.119 --> 11:26.718
(all gasp)

11:26.720 --> 11:29.454
I believe the expression
is ♪ ta-da! ♪

11:29.456 --> 11:30.755
(crowd cheering)

11:30.757 --> 11:34.292
I don't know what to think
about milk cans anymore.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.194
(excited gasp)

11:36.196 --> 11:37.295
That was amazing.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.799
I can see why they call you
The Great Simpsina.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.801
My friends
call me Lisa.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.069
She has no
friends.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.003
Shut up!

11:45.005 --> 11:46.037
Now, where were we?

11:46.039 --> 11:46.705
I got to admit,

11:46.707 --> 11:49.207
I was pretty nervous
when you were in that milk can.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.476
Oh, it's a lot less
dangerous than you think.

11:51.478 --> 11:56.214
You can see me do it again
in a talent show next week.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.148
I'd like to come.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.783
But only if I was sure

11:58.785 --> 11:59.818
you wouldn't get hurt.

11:59.820 --> 12:03.755
There's no chance
whatsoever.

12:03.757 --> 12:04.789
I'll show you.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.860
You don't open the top;
the locks are real.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.796
The can is in two halves,
and they slide apart.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.932
From inside, you
just push up.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.899
(chuckles)

12:14.901 --> 12:15.500
Easy peasy.

12:15.502 --> 12:19.237
And there's no way anyone
can figure out how it's done.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.438
Well, I can think of one way.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.008
You trick a dorky little girl
into telling you!

12:24.010 --> 12:25.110
(gasps)

12:25.112 --> 12:25.844
Yo, Dad!

12:25.846 --> 12:27.078
It's a three-quarter

12:27.080 --> 12:28.079
flange-less friction slide.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.148
What about the locks
on the lid?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.116
Shmuck-bait.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.117
Sweet, sweet!

12:32.119 --> 12:34.419
Oh, and the next time
it's my weekend with you,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.354
I promise there will be
no chicks over.

12:36.356 --> 12:41.326
Just you, me, the komodo dragon
and Ben Roethlisberger.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.162
Hell to the yes!

12:44.164 --> 12:46.464
(boy laughing)

12:51.438 --> 12:53.204
(Bart laughs)

12:55.375 --> 12:58.276
'Sup, magicfreeks.
Last night, for serious,

12:58.278 --> 13:01.479
I got haunted by a straight-up,
see-through ghost.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.149
It was Harry H-Dog Houdini, yo!

13:04.151 --> 13:07.118
Now, after calling me
"the new him"-- his words--

13:07.120 --> 13:10.889
he told me the secret
to his Milk Can Escape.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.056
(gasping, murmuring)

13:12.058 --> 13:12.590
Yeah.

13:12.592 --> 13:13.424
I will perform this trick

13:13.426 --> 13:15.860
at the upcoming
world magic championships!

13:15.862 --> 13:17.962
I recommend parking in the mall

13:17.964 --> 13:20.265
and taking the shuttle, yo!

13:20.267 --> 13:22.834
Raymondo, I
am so sorry.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.469
I got rolled
by a pro.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.304
Do you know
what it's like to be

13:26.306 --> 13:28.506
the kind of girl
that boys never talk to,

13:28.508 --> 13:31.910
and then, suddenly,
a boy talks to you?

13:31.912 --> 13:32.544
Get out.

13:32.546 --> 13:36.147
Haven't you ever been
fooled by a pretty face?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.348
Just once.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.183
I trusted you.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.485
Oh, you think I'm pretty?
(nervous laugh)

13:40.487 --> 13:42.520
Get out!

13:53.066 --> 13:53.865
D'oh!

13:53.867 --> 13:55.466
Lisa, don't feel bad.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.937
Judas betrayed Jesus,
but he still got paid.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.506
(sobbing):
Oh, no...

14:02.309 --> 14:06.911
I can't stand to see one of
my female children unhappy!

14:06.913 --> 14:08.546
I'm gonna go pound some sense

14:08.548 --> 14:12.350
into that ring-linking
rabbit-yanker.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.418
Hey, let me down!

14:13.420 --> 14:16.054
This is gonna leave
a diamond pattern on my skin!

14:16.056 --> 14:21.926
Imagine if your greatest secret
was given to your worst enemy.

14:21.928 --> 14:25.129
A peanut butter
and pretzel sandwich?

14:25.131 --> 14:25.563
Mmm!

14:25.565 --> 14:27.665
There's no way
a stupid Flanders like me

14:27.667 --> 14:29.334
could ever have
thought of this.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.203
Okay, maybe secrets
are a big deal,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.138
but my daughter's
a good kid.

14:34.140 --> 14:39.143
So why don't you act your age,
forgive her and let me down!

14:39.145 --> 14:41.179
(Homer snoring)

14:47.354 --> 14:49.254
(murmurs)

14:49.256 --> 14:50.922
(snoring)

14:55.328 --> 14:58.363
Hey, kid, nobody likes
a gloomy magician.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.032
Except, of course,
Gloomo the Magnificent.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.368
Raymondo, you forgive me!

15:03.370 --> 15:05.403
Not so fast.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.105
But still,
there is hope.

15:07.107 --> 15:07.672
(dove coos)

15:07.674 --> 15:10.742
Lisa, we've all done
things we're ashamed of.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.311
I briefly became
a disco magician.

15:13.313 --> 15:16.014
Have you ever tried to put
a leisure suit on a bird?

15:16.016 --> 15:18.650
You get his pants on,
he pulls his coat off,

15:18.652 --> 15:19.550
and on it goes.

15:19.552 --> 15:25.590
But now I need your help
to stop Cregg Demon.

15:26.226 --> 15:30.561
All right, I want
close-up magicians on the left,

15:30.563 --> 15:31.930
illusionists on the right,

15:31.932 --> 15:35.033
and mentalists-- well, I don't
need to tell you. (chuckles)

15:35.035 --> 15:36.401
Ah, come on, Lou, I need backup.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.535
LOU:
Wish I could help, Chief.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.606
I'll take the box that
doesn't talk back.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.208
Yeah, that's just
what you need, Chief,

15:44.210 --> 15:45.510
another stomach.

That's better.
(scoffs)

16:58.351 --> 17:00.685
(muffled):Help me!
He's going to die!

17:00.687 --> 17:03.321
Lisa, magicians hate
to be rescued.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.355
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:04.357 --> 17:07.325
I have to go to
the little magicians' room.

17:08.628 --> 17:13.097
I guess it's up to me to save
you, Cregg Demon Magicfreek.

17:13.099 --> 17:16.367
You ain't saving nobody
demon nothing freek!

17:16.369 --> 17:17.235
Ricky Jay?

17:17.237 --> 17:18.403
David Copperfield?

17:18.405 --> 17:19.370
Penn?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.371
(gasps)

17:20.373 --> 17:20.772
Teller!

17:20.774 --> 17:25.309
We switched the trick milk
can with a regular milk can.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.310
But why?

17:26.312 --> 17:27.545
Because, when he...

17:27.547 --> 17:28.179
Quiet!

17:28.181 --> 17:30.281
You talk onstage,
I talk offstage.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.417
That was the curse
the witch put on us.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.252
He stole all
our best tricks.

17:34.254 --> 17:37.789
And he stole
my sexiest magical gestures.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.058
Like this one-- ah.

17:40.060 --> 17:40.558
Aw...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.628
Wait, I know
he's an unethical magician,

17:43.630 --> 17:45.463
and his tattoos are
an inconsistent mix

17:45.465 --> 17:50.334
of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms,
but he doesn't deserve to die.

17:50.336 --> 17:51.869
We ain't
asking, kid.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.571
Get her!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.106
(screams)

17:55.642 --> 17:57.475
(whimpers)

17:57.477 --> 17:58.776

17:59.446 --> 18:01.279
(chainsaw buzzing)

18:01.281 --> 18:03.281
Penn, just drop them!

18:03.283 --> 18:04.682
I can't!

18:04.684 --> 18:06.684
I never learned how!

18:10.156 --> 18:11.122
(roars)

18:11.124 --> 18:13.257
I'll save you, Lisa!

18:14.427 --> 18:15.793
(muffled grunting)

18:15.795 --> 18:20.231
The real magic is raising
three kids in this economy!

18:20.233 --> 18:23.267
You can put the ball back now.

18:24.838 --> 18:28.306
Hands off my apprentice,
amateurs!

18:28.308 --> 18:29.607
(gasp)

18:29.609 --> 18:30.208
Raymondo?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.343
I thought I killed you
in Marrakesh.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.644
That was my twin brother.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.213
Ruined a lot of my tricks.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.348
We might as well
finish the job now.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.350
To show you we mean business,

18:39.352 --> 18:43.321
I'm unbuttoning my shirt
and turning on a fan.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.822
Wah. Oh, yeah.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.724
It's magical.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.165
(buzzing, crackling)

18:55.502 --> 18:56.901
I'm just an old man.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.338
How could I ever hope
to fight you all?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.540
Except... with this!

19:02.542 --> 19:04.308
(laughter)

19:05.678 --> 19:06.477
(pained grunting)

19:06.479 --> 19:10.581
My beautiful body,
no longer properly lit.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.282
(gasps)

19:11.284 --> 19:12.517
My ponytail's been burned!

19:12.519 --> 19:16.220
Teller, the witch's curse
is broken!

19:16.222 --> 19:18.356
Penn, there never
was a curse.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.191
You're a real jerk,
you know that?

19:20.193 --> 19:22.760
Raymondo, I knew your
heart was as pure

19:22.762 --> 19:25.863
as the ether
that helps you get to sleep.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.466
Raymondo?

19:29.435 --> 19:33.938
I believe the expression
is ♪ ta-da! ♪

19:33.940 --> 19:35.239
(groans weakly)

19:35.241 --> 19:36.507
Hey, whassup?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.176
(coughing)

19:38.178 --> 19:40.545
Let's go home, Dad.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.746
I'm through
with magic, son.

19:41.748 --> 19:46.684
I'm gonna move back to Canada
and run for Parliament.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.322
And here you go.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.424
"Do not give your coat to..."

19:53.426 --> 19:54.592
Damn it!

20:04.537 --> 20:07.338
(cheering, applause)

20:07.874 --> 20:08.706
So that's why

20:08.708 --> 20:11.742
Lisa excused herself
a few minutes ago.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.244
Now, once again,

20:13.246 --> 20:17.949
one of the most promising young
magicians I have ever seen:

20:17.951 --> 20:19.550
the Great Simpsina!

20:19.552 --> 20:20.551
(cheering, applause)

20:20.553 --> 20:21.786
Knock 'em dead, kid.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.322
I'll be in my
dressing room.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.656
(humming)

20:27.894 --> 20:30.795
Tell me if she falls.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.833
Abraca-Milhouse!

20:37.537 --> 20:40.271
(gas hissing softly)

20:40.273 --> 20:42.473
Hello, Harvey.

20:42.475 --> 20:45.276
I've probably
had enough.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.445
Eh, a little more
couldn't hurt.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.214
(inhales deeply)
