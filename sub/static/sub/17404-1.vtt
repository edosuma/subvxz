00:17.880 --> 00:20.870
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:20.920 --> 00:22.990
Thanks, everybody, thank you.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.390
Hello, good evening.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.230
Thank you so much.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.710
We're back!

00:28.760 --> 00:30.320
We have returned.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.990
We've returned with an all-new
series, and it is a cracker.

00:37.040 --> 00:42.510
We have got a review
of the Mk7 Volkswagen Golf,

00:42.560 --> 00:47.110
we've an extended report
of the 900cc Dacia Sandero,

00:47.160 --> 00:49.910
James has done that. It's very long.
LAUGHTER

00:49.960 --> 00:53.030
We've a piece on bicycles,
we've something on the stresses

00:53.080 --> 00:55.470
of long-distance lorry driving...
LAUGHTER

00:55.520 --> 00:58.920
..and the rest of it
sort of looks like this.

01:03.160 --> 01:06.830
They should have called this the
Widowmaker!

01:06.880 --> 01:08.710
Come on, little Alfa.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.120
We have to beat him.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.280
You want a race?
I'll give you a race!

01:17.000 --> 01:19.640
Oh, God. My doves have escaped.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.560
Arrrrrgh!

01:28.400 --> 01:31.520
Just have my heated seat set
to the first position.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.750
Morning. Sorry.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.030
The town in question is called...

01:39.080 --> 01:40.120
Chernobyl.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.000
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

01:49.480 --> 01:51.360
Goooahhh!

01:58.200 --> 02:01.440
'Newsnight now, on BBC TWO...'

02:04.600 --> 02:08.160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

02:09.759 --> 02:13.470
All that is to come.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.190
But first, there has been,
I'm afraid, a bit of a row
in the office.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.590
You see, we think
that the current crop
of hot hatchbacks are very good,

02:21.640 --> 02:25.590
however, we say they're not as good
as the hot hatchbacks

02:25.640 --> 02:27.750
you could buy in the '80s
or the '90s.

02:27.800 --> 02:31.630
Well, they're not, are they?
No, exactly, but our producers,
who are very young

02:31.680 --> 02:34.470
and wander around with
the top of their underpants

02:34.520 --> 02:36.390
showing at the back of their
trousers,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.110
say that we are talking nonsense.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.390
Yeah, so, to sort it all out,
they told us to go and buy

02:41.440 --> 02:44.470
three old hot hatches,
whilst they would devise

02:44.520 --> 02:46.870
a series of humiliating challenges.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.520
Hmm! Hmm!
LAUGHTER

02:51.040 --> 02:54.190
The meeting point
was a car park in Droitwich,

02:54.240 --> 02:56.240
and I was the first to arrive.

03:02.080 --> 03:05.550
This is a Volkswagen Golf GTI -

03:05.600 --> 03:10.120
the standard-bearer,
the benchmark, the daddy...

03:11.240 --> 03:16.190
And think about it - a modern-day
GTI would cost you Â£27,000.

03:16.240 --> 03:23.030
This was just 800 quid.
I mean, 800 quid! For a Golf GTI!

03:23.080 --> 03:28.510
It's only done 172,000 miles,
and at just 25 years old it's...
HORN HONKS

03:28.560 --> 03:30.040
Oh, there's James!

03:36.360 --> 03:39.430
Oh, God. That was a handbrake turn,
right there, ladies and gentlemen.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.470
Yo!

03:40.520 --> 03:41.830
XR2!

03:41.880 --> 03:44.550
XR2i, 16 valve.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.790
16 valve? Oh, yes.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.510
See, I've gone for the coveted Mk2
eight-valve model.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.390
Eight valve? Eight valve.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.430
What?
JAMES LAUGHS

03:53.480 --> 03:55.870
Oh, the comedy stickers.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.190
The thing is, James, what you have
to remember is,

03:58.240 --> 03:59.710
you know when you look at a car,

03:59.760 --> 04:02.550
how has it been treated?
Who's owned it?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.390
I looked at these stickers,

04:04.440 --> 04:06.470
the non-standard alloy wheels,

04:06.520 --> 04:08.310
and I suspect this has been slammed.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.150
It does look like it's been
slammed. It's been lowered.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.670
So you add those things together,

04:12.720 --> 04:16.709
and I've deduced it was probably
owned by...a parish priest?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.709
June Whitfield, probably.
It's funny you should say that,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.030
because I employ a similar tactic
when I'm buying a car, so I looked

04:23.080 --> 04:26.190
at things like - it has very
high-specification after-market

04:26.240 --> 04:28.670
brake pads. Has it? Which means it
was somebody

04:28.720 --> 04:31.390
interested in safety, not speed.
Yes. And also,

04:31.440 --> 04:34.150
they've done things like left
the jacking point exposed,

04:34.200 --> 04:37.030
so you spend less time exposed to
danger if you have to change

04:37.080 --> 04:39.590
your wheel on the hard shoulder.
Exactly.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.830
800 quid. 750 quid.

04:41.880 --> 04:45.280
You see, we've been clever,
we have been wise.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.870
Sadly, our discussion
was curtailed,

04:48.920 --> 04:50.560
because Hammond then arrived.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.390
And he hadn't been wise at all.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.750
JEREMY LAUGHS

04:57.800 --> 04:59.590
Is that...?

04:59.640 --> 05:02.950
No. No. No.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.150
Nova SRi. No. This is fun, isn't it?
I'm loving my day so far.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.830
Let me talk you through it -
1.4-litre multi-point fuel injection,

05:11.880 --> 05:13.830
82 brake horsepower. Uh-huh.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.710
This is light, and nippy and quick.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.350
This was the clever choice in its
day. Was it? Yeah. It was.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.630
Hammond... I love...
Hammond, Hammond, Hammond, Hammond.

05:23.680 --> 05:28.670
Yeah? This has spent more time on its
roof than it has on its wheels.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.230
All Novas are driven by yobbos
who turn them over.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.310
I must admit... Because it's not
just this door that doesn't match.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.430
That one was white.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.150
I don't think there's a ditch
in Essex that this hasn't visited.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.710
But it's still working. These are
very desirable. Are they?

05:42.760 --> 05:45.080
How much was it? 700 quid.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.110
Not that anyone ever actually
had to buy a Vauxhall Nova -

05:50.160 --> 05:52.590
it was much easier to steal one.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.950
Nobody's to watch this if you're
a car thief. Don't watch this.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.950
You have the keys. I have the keys.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.590
I'm going to remove the hazard
warning light switch, OK?

06:01.640 --> 06:05.520
Yep. I'm now going to pop it
back in again, upside down.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.430
And lo and behold, the ignition
comes on.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.670
Now it's just a question of, um...
Bump-start.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.950
Go!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.030
ENGINE STARTS

06:15.080 --> 06:17.110
And there we are.
HAMMOND LAUGHS

06:17.160 --> 06:18.680
And I've got the key!

06:19.800 --> 06:22.630
'As I was finishing my
demonstration,

06:22.680 --> 06:24.470
'I received a message.'

06:24.520 --> 06:26.630
MOBILE BLEEPS

06:26.680 --> 06:29.870
I've got a text.
Oh, it's from the producers. Eh?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.710
Yeah, it's the first
of the challenges.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.430
What happened to the gold envelope?

06:33.480 --> 06:35.230
He's a teenager.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.950
That would mean using a pen.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.510
Oh, he wouldn't have seen one
of those. No, he wouldn't. Anyway...

06:40.560 --> 06:43.310
Hang on. I don't know what it says.
Because you need your glasses?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.950
Oh, dear. I'm old!

06:46.000 --> 06:50.990
It says, "The main reason for buying
a hot hatchback is speed.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.510
"You will therefore do a performance
test at the Shelsley Walsh
Hill Climb

06:55.560 --> 06:56.960
"in your crocks of ship."

06:57.960 --> 06:59.070
Ship?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.590
Ship. I think there's been some
auto-correction. Yes.

07:02.640 --> 07:05.030
Right... Soldier on.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.990
CAR ALARM WAILS
Oh, bloody hell.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.790
Have you got an alarm?

07:08.840 --> 07:12.870
1989? They didn't have alarms,
so everybody put after-market alarms

07:12.920 --> 07:14.710
on them, which don't work. Ever.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.950
Oh, shut up!

07:17.000 --> 07:20.230
SECOND CAR ALARM WAILS
ALONGSIDE THE FIRST

07:20.280 --> 07:23.430
I'd like to be laughing
about them and their alarms,

07:23.480 --> 07:26.310
but I've just spotted
something which is...

07:26.360 --> 07:28.510
Well, everything got stolen
in the '80s,

07:28.560 --> 07:32.070
so they'd engrave the reg number on
the glass, and on the tailgate,

07:32.120 --> 07:35.030
I can't help but notice
that this registration number

07:35.080 --> 07:37.670
isn't the same as this
registration number,

07:37.720 --> 07:40.350
which means
it's not the original tailgate.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.990
I thought that was the only original
panel on it.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.000
ALARMS CONTINUE

07:46.040 --> 07:47.440
SINGLE ALARM CONTINUES

07:49.040 --> 07:51.320
JEREMY GROANS

07:54.280 --> 07:55.870
On the drive to the Hill Climb,

07:55.920 --> 07:58.720
we have the chance to get
acquainted with our cars.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.870
Oh, I love my little Nova.
It's all about simplicity, lightness.

08:04.920 --> 08:08.070
This has nothing on it that
you don't need.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.590
Door mirrors, manual.
Windows, manual.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.950
There isn't even a window winder
on the passenger side,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.320
because it's dropped off.
How simple and light is that?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.390
Since we're alone, viewers, and
it's traditional for me to be honest

08:24.440 --> 08:28.390
at this point, I will say that
the car feels a little careworn.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.350
The driver's seat smells funny,
the fuel gauge doesn't work

08:31.400 --> 08:33.990
all the time, and neither does
the temperature gauge.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.990
The radio only comes out
of one speaker.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.070
The clutch judders.
The wheels wobble.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.669
There are a lot of knocks
and rattles.

08:40.720 --> 08:44.240
Amazing, really,
because it's only done 23,000 miles.

08:47.280 --> 08:52.550
Let me do a systems check and make
sure all the equipment is working.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.670
Heated rear window, yep.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.230
Ashtray, yep.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.470
Good, that's that done.

08:59.520 --> 09:00.510
Third gear.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.320
CAR GROANS

09:03.840 --> 09:08.310
That G-force is nearly
tearing my face off!

09:08.360 --> 09:11.590
We were so brave in the '80s.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.110
We were brave and we were strong,
because we had no power steering.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.990
We didn't go to a gym -
we just went for a drive.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.840
That would build up a sweat.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.390
Many power-steering-less
miles later...

09:24.440 --> 09:26.030
God, I stink.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.320
..we arrived at the terrifying
Shelsley Walsh Hill Climb.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.430
Germany has the Nurburgring, America
has Pikes Peak - we have this.

09:38.480 --> 09:43.110
It's more than half a mile long,
and at the bottom of this fearsome

09:43.160 --> 09:46.310
ribbon of tarmac, we were given
more details of our challenge.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.950
MOBILE BLEEPS

09:48.000 --> 09:52.070
"A modern Seat Ibiza Cupre

09:52.120 --> 09:54.350
"will now go up the Hill Climb
course,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.790
"then you must try to beat its
time."

09:56.840 --> 10:00.550
Seat Cupre? Yeah.
That's fast, is it?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.710
Hang on, who's going to be
driving the Seat?

10:02.760 --> 10:07.070
It's not the Stig, is it? No. No,
it's not the Stig.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.800
It's the Stig's teenage cousin.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.110
Look at the size of it!
I know. It's a whale.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.750
Might as well try and drive up there
in that barn.

10:24.800 --> 10:28.550
With the traditional Hill Climb
chock holding the Seat in place,

10:28.600 --> 10:31.590
Teenage Stig was
ready for the off.

10:31.640 --> 10:32.680
Go!

10:37.120 --> 10:38.560
What a dreary spectacle.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.390
Doesn't have that nimble, light,

10:42.440 --> 10:44.840
tight, frenzied feel
of a proper hot hatch.

10:50.560 --> 10:51.840
Ohh...

10:54.200 --> 10:58.800
OVER RADIO: 'The Stig's teenage
cousin did it in 40.50.'

11:00.120 --> 11:04.360
What, to do 0.6 of a mile?
I shall halve it.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.750
As the Golf had the most power,
we agreed it should go first.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.830
Hold on, I'm just going to shut my
window.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.830
HE IMITATES BUZZING

11:14.880 --> 11:16.030
There it is.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.960
Three, two, one.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.470
That was all wheel-spin. That's
already quicker, look at that.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.230
Double declutch into second.
A pheasant!

11:28.280 --> 11:29.960
Ooh! That was close.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.510
Yeah!

11:33.560 --> 11:38.360
112 of the finest German horsepower
hurling me up this hill.

11:40.840 --> 11:44.040
60mph as we cross the line.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.400
Uhh-uhh!

11:49.560 --> 11:52.710
Next it was James' turn, in the XR2.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.360
Three, two, one, go!

11:57.920 --> 11:59.830
You bastard!

11:59.880 --> 12:02.080
Nice start(!)

12:03.280 --> 12:08.240
At speed, the XR2's 20-year-old
steering really came into its own.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.310
Oh, God.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.920
He's bought a dog.
He has bought an appalling dog.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.070
Whoa.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.520
This is terrible.

12:24.280 --> 12:28.670
More worryingly, on the way
back down, a marshal handed me back

12:28.720 --> 12:29.800
some of my car.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.080
That is a bolt, obviously.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.160
But for what?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.550
As I pondered on that,

12:45.600 --> 12:48.360
Jeremy prepared
the course for Hammond's Nova.

12:53.320 --> 12:58.150
Hammond. I have never seen a man
suit a car more than that.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.520
Three, two, one!

13:03.120 --> 13:04.110
Ah-ha-ha!

13:04.160 --> 13:07.230
That's some wheel-spin.

13:07.280 --> 13:10.230
There are some people who look like
their dogs. There are one or two

13:10.280 --> 13:13.520
people who look like their cars,
and, yeah... Little... Nova drivers.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.360
Everything, now.
Come on, unleash the lot.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.960
Across the line!

13:24.360 --> 13:26.400
And now, back down!

13:27.920 --> 13:28.960
Oh, yeah.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.310
TYRES SCREECH

13:32.360 --> 13:34.750
SMASHING

13:34.800 --> 13:36.630
BIRDS' WINGS FLAPPING

13:36.680 --> 13:39.350
Predictably, Hammond had binned it.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.790
Oh, my God. No!

13:41.840 --> 13:44.400
How the hell did you get it there?

13:46.200 --> 13:49.520
Well, I was coming down here, and...
Oh, hang on, it's...

13:51.880 --> 13:54.470
You have righted it.
You have righted it.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.510
Look, he's actually beaming
because you stuffed your...

13:57.560 --> 14:00.310
Well, you can tell your mates, can't
you? In the ditch.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.830
And it's a complete roll now.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.630
Cos this was the thing in the '80s -
you put your car in a ditch,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.350
and you did, and you found it funny.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.550
Do you realise if Constable
had lived today, he would have

14:10.600 --> 14:14.950
painted that. It would have been
called the HEY, WAYNE.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.320
JEREMY LAUGHS
Very good.

14:18.640 --> 14:23.070
As the marshals recovered
the Nova, we were given the results.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.200
What was the Stig? 40... 40.5.
Right. I was...

14:28.200 --> 14:31.670
..47.4.

14:31.720 --> 14:37.630
May, perhaps not surprisingly, 50.4.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.070
Right.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.790
Hammond...

14:40.840 --> 14:43.750
46.3.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.230
So you were the fastest, and
I congratulate you. Thank you.

14:47.280 --> 14:51.350
But the point is, we were all slower
than the Stig, and yet we weren't.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.270
Mm-hm. Hang on.
How do you make that out?

14:53.320 --> 14:56.590
Time moved more slowly in the '80s.

14:56.640 --> 15:02.870
Because when you're 30,
a year is a 30th of your life.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.920
When you're 50,
it's a 50th of your life.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.520
'By the time Hammond had got this
one worked out...

15:13.640 --> 15:14.880
'..darkness had fallen.'

15:16.120 --> 15:19.590
So what have we learned?
Well, obviously we've learned

15:19.640 --> 15:24.550
that our cars are much cheaper
than their modern-day equivalent,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.550
and in real terms faster.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.560
But I think we'd all agree that they
are looking a little bit...tired.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.550
So we decided to spruce them up
at the top-secret

15:36.600 --> 15:39.590
Top Gear Antique Restoration Centre,

15:39.640 --> 15:42.990
on the A451,
just outside Kidderminster.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.110
Here, cars are wrapped in a special
self-adhesive material

15:47.160 --> 15:50.200
to give them
a brand-new factory-fresh look.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.070
If you pay somebody else
to respray your car...

15:56.120 --> 15:58.350
Â£5,000, Â£10,000. Easily.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.150
This is less than 1,000.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.160
You know, pull the right bit
off there, job done.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.320
With the Renault done,
we decided to do our cars ourselves.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.270
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

16:15.320 --> 16:21.310
OK, well... We'll see how we get on
with that later on.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.590
But now, it's time to do the news.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.910
Now, BMW has made
a three-cylinder hybrid.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.230
Would you like to see a photograph?
Well, no, not really, no.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.430
Well, that's a rotten bit of luck
cos here it is.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.430
Wow, is that it? Yeah,
three-cylinder hybrid, right there.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.670
It looks quite good.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.910
Is it vaguely reminiscent of the old
M1? Remember the supercar they did?

16:41.960 --> 16:45.470
What it is, I'll tell you exactly
what it is, that is the future.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.710
It really genuinely is.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.390
It's lightweight construction,
petrol engine,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.590
working in tandem
with an electric motor.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.910
I know that sounds dreary,
but think about it,

16:53.960 --> 16:57.550
it's the exact same recipe
you get in a McLaren P1,

16:57.600 --> 17:00.750
and that is not dreary at all.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.910
No, and more to the point,
you've driven it,
it's on the show next week. Yes.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.109
Well, Come on, give us a hint,
what's it like?

17:06.160 --> 17:10.790
It is genuinely unbelievable.
The speed simply is mind-blowing.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.990
How fast? Beyond...

17:13.040 --> 17:17.470
You can't keep up with just
how fast it goes, that P1,

17:17.520 --> 17:19.430
and because of the P1,

17:19.480 --> 17:22.790
it means normal people
can now drive a hybrid.

17:22.839 --> 17:27.430
You don't have to wear
nuclear-free peace sandals,

17:27.480 --> 17:30.470
you can be like normal people here
and have a hybrid.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.030
That's why I think that is
going to be brilliant.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.030
The thing is, it will go like a 911,
cost about the same,

17:37.080 --> 17:40.230
but you don't have to be a moron
to drive one.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.750
Child! You child! Like James
and Richard both have 911s.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.550
Really?
We're back at work, aren't we?

17:46.600 --> 17:49.350
We are back in the playground, yeah.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.750
I'd like to talk about
things I'm sorry I missed

17:51.800 --> 17:53.230
while we've been off air.

17:53.280 --> 17:58.150
Plans are being drawn up, right,
to fine the owner of a car,

17:58.200 --> 18:00.670
if a passenger throws litter
out of the window.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.270
Fine him? The owner...

18:02.320 --> 18:04.510
Oh, throw him to the dogs.
Well, no...

18:04.560 --> 18:08.030
Use the Kim Jong-un technique
on people who litter.

18:08.080 --> 18:11.870
No, I know what you mean, cos
littering is the most moronic crime.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.190
It's pitiful, however, thanks to
this there is now an excuse for it.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.550
An excuse for littering? Yeah. What?

18:17.600 --> 18:19.630
Think about it, James, mate... Yes?

18:19.680 --> 18:21.750
..can I have a lift home tonight
in your car?

18:21.800 --> 18:23.750
JEREMY LAUGHS

18:23.800 --> 18:28.310
Just me and, like, my favourite
bin bag full of empty crisp packets.

18:28.360 --> 18:32.950
I was once riding my motorcycle
past a line of stationary cars

18:33.000 --> 18:37.750
and I was hit in the face
by half a ready meal that had been
thrown out of a window...

18:37.800 --> 18:41.230
I mean, still hot. That was me!

18:41.280 --> 18:43.790
Was it?
Yeah, and it wasn't a ready meal!

18:43.840 --> 18:46.110
No.
LAUGHTER

18:46.160 --> 18:48.280
It was an adult nappy!

18:49.360 --> 18:53.150
Anyway, we've had the Formula One
testing all last week,

18:53.200 --> 18:54.470
as I'm sure you know.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.230
Important this year, the testing,
cos there's so many new rules.

18:57.280 --> 19:02.030
The cars have to have 1.6 litre
engines, narrower wings

19:02.080 --> 19:03.630
and sex aids on the front.

19:03.680 --> 19:07.910
Don't be stupid,
they don't have to... They do!

19:07.960 --> 19:09.630
Hello?
Have a look at this at Caterham.

19:09.680 --> 19:12.390
That's a sex aid on the front!
Oh, no! What are they...?

19:12.440 --> 19:14.150
We've got a close-up
on the Toro Rosso.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.920
Oh, God! You wouldn't want to be
rear-ended by that, would you?

19:19.280 --> 19:21.270
Cos if you think of it,
you get in the car,

19:21.320 --> 19:23.230
strap yourself in and there it is.

19:23.280 --> 19:25.070
It is a strap-on, basically.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.790
Formula "strap" One!
Formula "strap" One!

19:27.840 --> 19:30.030
Formula "strap" One is what it is!

19:30.080 --> 19:32.870
Right, here's a scenario. You're
racing towards the finish line,

19:32.920 --> 19:34.990
neck and neck,
you want to cross the line first.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.070
It's good if you could extend
the front a bit... Yeah.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.590
..and maybe if you were,
I don't know, let's say,

19:40.640 --> 19:42.910
having trouble extending
the bit at the front,

19:42.960 --> 19:46.750
they could have a little blue
triangular button on the steering
wheel that you could press.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.030
V Power! Yes!

19:48.080 --> 19:51.630
There it is! For about
an hour and a half...it's longer!

19:51.680 --> 19:52.950
I'm just saying.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.270
You don't get coverage like that
in Autosport magazine. Oh, yeah.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.790
Now, are you always late
for your game of golf?

20:00.840 --> 20:05.950
Are you sick of being the last to
the lodge? Well, it's good news!

20:06.000 --> 20:08.750
CHEERING
Is it another Dacia?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.710
It's not a Dacia...
LAUGHTER

20:11.760 --> 20:16.150
There is a new 450-brake horsepower
Lexus called the RCF.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.880
Here it is, what do you think?

20:18.920 --> 20:21.590
I hate to have to say this, James,
but I actually quite like it.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.110
I'm glad, cos I quite like it
as well.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.510
Oh, God, I'm going to catch golf
from you two! Ugh!

20:28.560 --> 20:31.750
I'm going to turn up next week
like that. Hang on a minute, though.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.070
This is the second Lexus you've
liked. It is, you're a Lexus fan.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.390
There you go.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.510
And then, I'm going to join
the police as a constable

20:40.560 --> 20:42.470
and become a chief inspector
within a week

20:42.520 --> 20:44.710
with me trouser leg rolled up
and one of those.

20:44.760 --> 20:47.640
Oh, it was the Masons!
I thought that was a sexual thing!

20:48.840 --> 20:50.910
Ooh, I tell you what I was driving
the other day,

20:50.960 --> 20:53.310
the new Mercedes S-Class
which is available

20:53.360 --> 20:56.030
with a thermal imaging camera, OK,

20:56.080 --> 20:58.750
which sends a feed from the front
of the car onto the dashboard,

20:58.800 --> 21:01.630
so you can see
what's ahead at night,

21:01.680 --> 21:05.190
beyond the range of your headlights.
We've got some footage of it here.

21:05.240 --> 21:06.710
So as you're driving along,

21:06.760 --> 21:08.550
the camera can see animals,
there you go,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.630
and it picks them out in red,
or people.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.710
As it's going along there is
an animal, you see?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.990
That's clever. A bit of a gimmick,
though, isn't it?
You wouldn't rely on it.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.510
You say that, James, but I was
coming back to my flat in London

21:19.560 --> 21:22.670
the other night, it was quite late,
in the S-Class with that turned on.

21:22.720 --> 21:26.430
As I was going up, it picked out
a red box in some bushes,

21:26.480 --> 21:28.190
just outside my front door.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.070
I drove up, I thought,

21:30.120 --> 21:32.350
"What on earth is that
at this time of the morning?"

21:32.400 --> 21:35.310
Drove up, when the headlines got
there, paparazzi photographer.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.070
So it can find paps hiding in the
dark? Yeah, but there's a problem.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.110
Because when I tried
to run him down...
LAUGHTER

21:43.160 --> 21:47.150
As you get near, it automatically
applies the brakes.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.270
What's the point of targeting
somebody, if you can't hit them?

21:51.320 --> 21:53.430
They haven't thought that through.

21:53.480 --> 21:56.150
Back to the drawing board with that,
please, Mercedes.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.510
Now, obviously the biggest news
while we were off air

22:01.560 --> 22:05.310
was the tragic accident
that Michael Schumacher had.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.350
I don't know if any of his family
are watching, but I'm sure everybody

22:08.400 --> 22:12.870
here would join with us to wish him
a full and speedy recovery.

22:12.920 --> 22:16.240
Absolutely.
APPLAUSE

22:17.240 --> 22:19.440
Come on, old fella, pull through.
Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:23.990
Now...

22:24.040 --> 22:28.990
Tonight we are attempting to prove
to our teenage producers that the

22:29.040 --> 22:33.550
hot hatches of our youth were better
than the hot hatches of today.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.270
Yes, and when we left the action
we were at the Top Gear Restoration

22:37.320 --> 22:42.360
Technical Centre, where we
decided to wrap our cars ourselves.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.200
Because Hammond's car was
the smallest, he finished first.

22:48.840 --> 22:53.030
The results of my labours.
Urban camo.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.790
Or it might be Arctic urban camo.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.550
Yeah, there's a rough edge here and
there, but for a first attempt

22:58.600 --> 22:59.790
I think it's pretty crisp...

22:59.840 --> 23:01.560
Behold the genius! What?

23:02.600 --> 23:06.030
Hello. Mate, it's...

23:06.080 --> 23:09.400
HAMMOND LAUGHS

23:10.960 --> 23:17.550
I haven't seen it in the light, it's
terrible! How brilliant is this?

23:17.600 --> 23:21.590
What you're looking at here is
velvet. Why didn't you DRIVE it out?

23:21.640 --> 23:27.670
Because I suspect James May,
as a cruel joke, has hidden my keys.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.230
Actually, no. I suspect you've
effectively hidden your keys

23:32.280 --> 23:35.510
because I suspect that's them there,
look.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.030
You left them on the roof.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.030
And while I'm here,
isn't there a sunroof on this car?

23:40.080 --> 23:42.990
Yes, here. Well, you can't open it,
or this door.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.390
Or in fact, this door.
Burglar-proof.

23:46.440 --> 23:50.520
As Jeremy retrieved his keys,
James appeared.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.800
He hasn't got the idea of wrapping,
has he? No.

23:57.560 --> 24:00.110
Come on! It's a bit annual, mate.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.350
That's exactly it. It's seasonal.
It is unequivocal, is what it is.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.070
If you park that by the side
of the road,

24:05.120 --> 24:07.270
and say to anyone,
"What's happened to that car?"

24:07.320 --> 24:09.510
and they will say it,
"Oh, it's been wrapped."

24:09.560 --> 24:11.270
Hang on, a text.

24:11.320 --> 24:14.230
"Dear grandad..." Ooh!
Really? Thank you.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.350
"Because 1980s hot hatchbacks
were so easy to steal,

24:18.400 --> 24:22.270
"they were mostly used for doing
handbrake turns on housing estates

24:22.320 --> 24:24.150
"and ram raiding Woolworths.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.390
"So, to see which one of your
ridiculous cars..." Superb cars.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.120
"..is best, you will have a game
of Supermarket Sweep."

24:35.120 --> 24:36.790
The rules were simple.

24:36.840 --> 24:41.030
The producers had laid out a course
around the aisles of a supermarket

24:41.080 --> 24:46.200
and we had to see which of our cars
could get around it the fastest.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.070
Right, James, you are going first.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.470
Just so you know, there is a second
added to your time for every

24:52.520 --> 24:55.830
Â£1 of damage that you do out there.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.950
Right. OK? OK.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.670
This is going to be like
living in the 1980s.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.840
ENGINE REVS

25:04.480 --> 25:07.160
Three, two, one, go!

25:10.600 --> 25:12.990
Obviously,
I am the intelligent one here

25:13.040 --> 25:17.400
and the point of this is to not hit
anything, not to go around quickly.

25:18.840 --> 25:20.160
He's neat. Isn't he?

25:22.000 --> 25:26.790
A second is more easily saved
by not breaking something

25:26.840 --> 25:29.270
than by driving into things.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.880
Through the chicane...

25:32.040 --> 25:35.080
Missing that, missing that,
missing everything.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.360
Oh, his wheel got jammed up with...
spam! Spam!

25:42.480 --> 25:44.560
Briskly around there...

25:45.960 --> 25:48.480
And through to the finish.

25:50.440 --> 25:54.200
How did I do? One minute and two,
but you did hit things, James.

25:55.840 --> 25:58.750
After the value of the smashed
custard creams

25:58.800 --> 26:01.910
and the splattered Spam
had been totted up,

26:01.960 --> 26:04.310
I took my place on the start line.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.440
CAR ALARM BLARES

26:09.440 --> 26:10.880
Good.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.680
Yes! Three, two, one, go!

26:18.240 --> 26:19.920
That's a vigorous start.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.800
Here we go!

26:24.200 --> 26:25.920
And into the turn.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.110
It's a bad crash! Oh, no!

26:32.160 --> 26:35.710
That's a couple of seconds off
there. Yeah, I'd say so.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.390
Things have gone literally...

26:38.440 --> 26:41.080
I've hit the luxury toiletries!

26:43.400 --> 26:44.910
And some bread.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.040
Yes, I've just hit some... Oh.

26:48.400 --> 26:54.160
Oh, no! I've got Rich Tea biscuits,
literally everywhere.

26:58.840 --> 27:00.430
Oh, God above.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.830
Well, it is a quick time now,
but it possibly won't be

27:02.880 --> 27:05.360
once we've added on...
the destruction!

27:10.520 --> 27:11.960
I've gone again.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.280
In the plums!

27:16.360 --> 27:18.240
He's on the finishing straight.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.840
And...across the line!

27:25.760 --> 27:29.710
It took a very long time
to work out Jeremy's score.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.280
But eventually, it was my go.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.630
Let's do this.

27:35.680 --> 27:39.230
What do you think he's going to do?
Your style, or my style?

27:39.280 --> 27:41.190
Well, if he's got any sense
he'll do mine,

27:41.240 --> 27:43.670
but he hasn't got any sense
cos he's Hammond, so...

27:43.720 --> 27:47.640
Go! Come on, little Nova,
here we go.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.600
Oh, dear. Oh, that's...

27:54.080 --> 27:56.160
Gee, that was enormous!

27:57.160 --> 28:00.360
ENGINE REVS AND TYRES SQUEAL

28:02.120 --> 28:04.480
What manner of thing did he do?

28:10.160 --> 28:11.240
Run away!

28:16.920 --> 28:18.520
Here he comes.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.400
And across the line!

28:25.560 --> 28:29.000
Well, that's predictable. Oh, 1:04.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.590
That completed
the supermarket challenge.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.910
All we had to do now was help
Hammond right his car.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.720
..Three... Maybe another one?

28:44.240 --> 28:46.040
Come on!

28:47.200 --> 28:49.720
ALL GRUNT

28:56.080 --> 29:00.550
The next morning, as we set off
to Wales for our next challenge,

29:00.600 --> 29:03.160
all was not well in our convoy.

29:06.240 --> 29:10.390
A packet of Coco Pops had severed
the fuel line in Hammond's Nova.

29:10.440 --> 29:15.070
And one of the many crashes
had damaged Jeremy's Golf.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.990
Oh, God, no, this steering...

29:17.040 --> 29:20.720
There's something catastrophically
wrong. Look at it!

29:21.760 --> 29:26.760
I can't... Oh!
Um, gentlemen, I may have to stop.

29:27.920 --> 29:30.510
A couple of miles further on,

29:30.560 --> 29:33.560
I found an empty airfield
where I could do some repairs.

29:35.040 --> 29:38.350
Yes, the handling characteristics
were affected by a small accident

29:38.400 --> 29:40.630
last night with some beef stew.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.270
Oh, dear. I hit the bottom
of the wheel and it's gone in.
But you can solve it.

29:44.320 --> 29:48.310
Yes, I've seen that done.
Most F1 teams do something similar(!)

29:48.360 --> 29:50.190
Is your car working yet, Hammond?

29:50.240 --> 29:53.270
I've got to put a new fuel pipe on,
it'll take me a second.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.110
I've got one more jubilee clip to do
and it'll be done.
MOBILE BLEEPS

29:56.160 --> 29:59.230
What? Text, which could mean
it is from the producers.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.230
Ah, the results of Supermarket
Sweep are in. Oh, brilliant.

30:04.280 --> 30:08.950
James - one minute and five seconds.
Three quid's worth of damage?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.910
Three seconds added, three quid's
worth of damaged produce.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.110
Richard. Yes?

30:14.160 --> 30:19.110
Two minutes and 12 seconds.
That's 60-something quid's worth.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.190
You got a minute and eight seconds,
yeah, you got Â£68 worth of damage.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.310
Jeremy Clarkson. Yes?

30:25.360 --> 30:28.190
28 minutes and six seconds.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.720
Don't be stupid! Oh, you didn't
quite make the half hour!

30:32.240 --> 30:37.910
It's rubbish, anyway, because in the
'80s I did not ram raid shops.

30:37.960 --> 30:41.470
I had much better things to do
with my cars. What?

30:41.520 --> 30:46.030
I can't tell you now. Why not?
The producers.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.470
What? What I'm going to do, Hammond,
you can't do in front of

30:49.520 --> 30:51.750
BBC health and safety people.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.750
Eventually the producers went to get
something to eat

30:55.800 --> 30:59.910
and with the cars mended,
I began my demonstration.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.990
Right, this is called
Lap Of Your Own Car.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.830
I'm going to climb out of
the window, over the roof,

31:05.880 --> 31:07.590
through the passenger window

31:07.640 --> 31:11.670
and back behind the wheel
before the car stops.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.950
But you're the driver. Yes.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.830
Right! Are we ready? I'm going to
pop it into neutral. Here we go.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.670
Oh, my God. I think this is what
George Michael was trying to do.

31:20.720 --> 31:25.870
Small steering input. I've got it.
Oh, my God. It doesn't really steer.

31:25.920 --> 31:28.830
I'm out! He is out of the car.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.430
I'm actually on the roof
of a moving vehicle.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.830
I am doing a lap now.
Here he comes, ladies and gentlemen.

31:34.880 --> 31:35.950
Here he is, coming in.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.110
Tell you what, velvet's good,
you get better traction.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.030
RICHARD LAUGHS

31:41.080 --> 31:45.080
Genuinely staggered. It worked! Yes!

31:46.280 --> 31:50.440
This success sent us on
a journey down memory lane.

31:53.640 --> 31:58.390
Yeah! Two silver trays underneath
the rear wheels, handbrake on,

31:58.440 --> 31:59.960
the best game in the world.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.030
Musical chairs, let it begin.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.720
Right, you're now steering.

32:08.320 --> 32:10.350
I'm in the driver's seat! Your hair!

32:10.400 --> 32:12.350
Get off!

32:12.400 --> 32:15.670
Your bottom is touching my sausage!

32:15.720 --> 32:18.710
May, go back. Go, go, go!

32:18.760 --> 32:22.120
THEY SCREAM

32:25.880 --> 32:27.190
The '80s were brilliant.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.910
They were better.
Just much better. Music was better.

32:29.960 --> 32:32.430
Everything was better. Oh, yeah.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.110
We then rounded off our Don't Try
This At Home nostalgia trip

32:36.160 --> 32:38.030
with a traditional drag race.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.840
Three, two, one, go!

32:45.120 --> 32:49.310
The mighty Golf GTi.
Come on, Nova. Come on, come on!

32:49.360 --> 32:50.680
No, he's getting away!

32:52.680 --> 32:54.750
ENGINE GROANS

32:54.800 --> 32:56.960
What's... Oh!

32:58.800 --> 33:01.590
A total victory.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.590
What's happened to Hammond?

33:03.640 --> 33:06.470
What had happened to Hammond
was not good.

33:06.520 --> 33:09.910
Still there. Perhaps it's not
used to being the right way up.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.400
ENGINE STRUGGLES

33:14.640 --> 33:17.670
It's fine. It's fine.

33:17.720 --> 33:21.360
ENGINE GRINDS
Oh, that's good as well. Fine.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.190
You've knackered that.
You've totalled your Nova.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.910
It's fine.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.320
APPLAUSE

33:33.400 --> 33:36.390
Hammond... No, what?! Hammond...

33:36.440 --> 33:39.590
Would you like to tell
the ladies and gentlemen

33:39.640 --> 33:41.390
what happened to your Nova?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.790
It just blew up. Did it? Boom!

33:43.840 --> 33:47.550
Or did you change into first
rather than third?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.230
Well, I did do that a bit. Exactly.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.950
Never mind that, because
the producers are very cross with us

33:54.000 --> 33:56.150
about our little trip
down memory lane.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.950
They say that it might make
young people copy us.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.550
I don't see why,
it's not like they've ever copied
anything else we do, is it?

34:02.600 --> 34:06.630
No, you never hear kids
in the barber's say,
"Can I have hair like James May's?"

34:06.680 --> 34:08.670
It was a montage of stuff

34:08.719 --> 34:12.630
that was acceptable in the '80s
that isn't acceptable now.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.270
Like wearing white socks. Exactly.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.070
Or saying to a female co-worker,
"You look nice today."

34:18.120 --> 34:21.190
Exactly. You can't do that any more.

34:21.239 --> 34:25.230
Anyway, we must move on,
because I want to talk about

34:25.280 --> 34:27.870
one of the most evocative words
in motoring.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.190
Bonneville. Team it with "Triumph",
it's a legendary motorcycle.

34:32.239 --> 34:37.350
Team it with "salt flats", it's
a shrine to the pursuit of speed.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.750
Team it with "Hugh" and it's...
neither of those things.

34:40.800 --> 34:44.790
But it is tonight's
Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.

34:44.840 --> 34:50.469
From Downton Abbey, his favourite
TV show, Hugh Bonneville!

34:50.520 --> 34:52.830
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

34:52.880 --> 34:55.790
Hello! How are you?

34:55.840 --> 34:58.190
He's here!

34:58.240 --> 35:01.040
He's here. Have a seat. Thank you.

35:02.800 --> 35:06.750
Richard Hammond is beside himself
with excitement.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.750
Downton, he's obsessed.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.630
I want to begin, if I may, talking
about your early life, early cars.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.630
Despite your legendary name,
it doesn't seem like

35:16.680 --> 35:18.990
you come from a family of
speed freaks.

35:19.040 --> 35:23.790
No, the Bonneville salt flats
don't feature in my pedigree.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.870
We were a family of Volvos,
when I was growing up.

35:26.920 --> 35:32.790
Starting with a 121, a roundy shape,
number plate NUV665E.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.150
For some reason,
I can remember that number plate,

35:35.200 --> 35:36.750
but I can't remember my own now.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.830
That's a weird thing. I was talking
to James about this the other day.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.990
We can remember the number plates
of our fathers' cars.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.350
JWY370J, DW510H
on the Cortina 1600E.

35:47.400 --> 35:50.830
FYR495J on the Volvo 124.

35:50.880 --> 35:56.630
So you can remember all your dad's
Volvos? Yeah, it's tragic, really.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.550
They were 1 Series Volvos,
so very early ones.

35:59.600 --> 36:02.710
The weird thing about
the first one, the NUV665E,

36:02.760 --> 36:05.910
was that my dad
regretted selling it,

36:05.960 --> 36:11.070
and he was at a zebra crossing
near where we lived in Blackheath

36:11.120 --> 36:14.150
and suddenly he spotted it
about five years later

36:14.200 --> 36:15.750
and flagged down the driver and said,

36:15.800 --> 36:18.590
"If ever you want to sell it, it was
the biggest mistake of my life."

36:18.640 --> 36:20.150
Later, the bloke got in touch

36:20.200 --> 36:22.630
and it was in the family
for the next ten years.

36:22.680 --> 36:27.790
On the subject of family,
why did you try to bury your sister

36:27.840 --> 36:30.230
when she was still
perfectly healthy?

36:30.280 --> 36:32.470
LAUGHTER

36:32.520 --> 36:36.430
I can't believe you've asked me that
question. That's quite embarrassing.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.670
Well, she'd been quite annoying.

36:38.720 --> 36:42.630
I was about eight and she was 16,
I think.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.270
I complained to Mum,

36:44.320 --> 36:48.030
and she was cooking supper and said,
"Yes, that must be annoying."

36:48.080 --> 36:51.670
I said, "I'm going to kill her,
but first I'm going to dig a grave."

36:51.720 --> 36:54.870
And she said, "Yes, dear,
dinner will be in half an hour."

36:54.920 --> 36:57.750
I got a shovel
and I started digging,

36:57.800 --> 37:01.310
I measured it out,
six foot long and that wide...

37:01.360 --> 37:04.430
I got about three inches

37:04.480 --> 37:09.510
and the weird thing was,
Magpie were filming in our street.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.510
They were doing a programme
about rag-and-bone men.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.510
My mum ran out to say,
"We've got an old tin bath,"

37:16.560 --> 37:20.870
so they said, "Can we film coming
round the back of the house?"

37:20.920 --> 37:24.360
to where the tin bath was, and
the cameraman fell in the grave!

37:25.880 --> 37:28.230
I hasten to add, I love my sister.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.470
Yeah! Tried to kill her.

37:29.520 --> 37:32.270
I once tried to kill my sister
when she put a drawing pin

37:32.320 --> 37:33.790
through my space hopper.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.720
AUDIENCE: Ooh!
Bitch!

37:38.480 --> 37:42.600
You heard that, Joanna. Lord
Grantham just called you a bitch.

37:44.320 --> 37:48.150
Did you have a flirtation
with Triumphs as a family?

37:48.200 --> 37:50.110
I always coveted my aunt's
Triumph Stag,

37:50.160 --> 37:52.910
which was a beautiful car,
and the selfish cow sold it

37:52.960 --> 37:55.590
rather than give it to me
for free.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.430
A Stag. You'd suit a Stag. A Stag.

37:58.480 --> 38:01.150
You don't actually drive
a two-seater sports car

38:01.200 --> 38:02.550
from what I understand?

38:02.600 --> 38:07.910
No, I don't. I currently have
an XC90, a Volvo XC90. A fine car.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.870
I bought it off a friend ten years
ago and it has served us very well.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.310
But going to go to an Audi Q5.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.190
Is that really Snoozeville?

38:17.240 --> 38:18.750
That's like forsaking all food

38:18.800 --> 38:21.510
and saying, "I'm going to live
for the rest of my life

38:21.560 --> 38:23.470
"on nothing but wallpaper paste."

38:23.520 --> 38:26.510
It's an appalling... Jeremy! What?

38:26.560 --> 38:28.510
Stop talking to him about cars.

38:28.560 --> 38:34.510
Hammond... Never, you're always
having a cup of tea.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.590
What? Stop talking to him
about cars. Why?

38:37.640 --> 38:40.590
Because he's from Downton Abbey.

38:40.640 --> 38:45.000
He's Lord Grantham, over there.
I know! He's looking at me!

38:49.800 --> 38:54.070
Ask him my question. What question?
Who's Lady Mary going to marry?

38:54.120 --> 38:58.950
Which one? Who is Lady Mary
going to marry?

38:59.000 --> 39:01.790
I have no idea. I'm sorry,
Richard, I don't know.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.070
Of course he knows!
He's Lord Grantham!

39:04.120 --> 39:06.350
Hammond, he's not here
to talk about Downton,

39:06.400 --> 39:08.190
you're here to talk about
your new film.

39:08.240 --> 39:12.360
Exactly. Go away! Back in your box!
Go away!

39:13.720 --> 39:17.830
Anyway, the new film,
The Monuments Men, what is it about?

39:17.880 --> 39:21.470
It is based on the true story of
these rather unsung heroes

39:21.520 --> 39:26.270
of the Second World War, who were
art historians and museum curators

39:26.320 --> 39:30.910
who were sent in after D-day,
largely, to try and locate the art

39:30.960 --> 39:33.990
and treasures that the Nazis
were spiriting away,

39:34.040 --> 39:37.670
and also to persuade the Allies not
to blow up that particular church

39:37.720 --> 39:39.190
because there are Germans in it,

39:39.240 --> 39:41.270
because it does contain
part of our culture.

39:41.320 --> 39:43.950
Really? And that's a true story?
It's based on a true story.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.550
We've got a clip. Ooh!
I've not seen anything of it.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.430
Well, you can have a look at
yourself on telly. Look, here we go.

39:49.480 --> 39:52.910
And finally, we have your sculptor,
Sergeant Walter Garfield.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.470
He's a good egg.
I worked with him on the World War I
memorial in St Louis.

39:56.520 --> 39:57.790
A-ha! St Louis...

39:57.840 --> 40:00.870
GUNFIRE

40:00.920 --> 40:05.070
How are you, old boy?
Hey, Walter, how they treating you?

40:05.120 --> 40:06.790
Taking it pretty easy on us.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.190
I think that they feel sorry
for us old guys.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.470
I don't much fancy
an obstacle course. It's not so bad.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.430
By the end, you're just crawling
on your belly

40:14.480 --> 40:16.430
while teenagers
shoot blanks over your head.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.710
Well, yes and no. How's that?

40:18.760 --> 40:22.200
Yes, they are teenagers. And no?
They're not blanks.

40:25.840 --> 40:29.310
Looks like my sort of film.
That is my sort of film.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.790
Now, George Clooney.
He directed it as well, didn't he?

40:34.840 --> 40:39.230
George directed it, he stars in it,
he produced it and he co-wrote it.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.950
I've been wondering, looking at
what you're doing at the moment,

40:43.000 --> 40:44.950
is how on earth
you are fitting it in,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.830
because you're also working on W1A.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.150
Yes, W1A is a spin-off of
a show I did called Twenty Twelve.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.510
Which was fabulous. Thank you
very much. I properly loved that.

40:54.560 --> 40:58.030
It was a mockumentary about
trying to organise the Olympics.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.270
Obviously, my character made such a
success of organising the Olympics,

41:01.320 --> 41:04.190
I'm the go-to man
to sort out corporate issues.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.990
So what better place than
to go into the BBC?

41:07.040 --> 41:08.750
When I heard that
this was happening,

41:08.800 --> 41:12.190
and I can see all the location signs
around the BBC buildings

41:12.240 --> 41:14.350
where you are filming it,
I was thinking,

41:14.400 --> 41:17.670
how do you make fiction
about BBC management

41:17.720 --> 41:20.160
funnier than what actually happens?

41:21.280 --> 41:24.310
Broadcasting House, the new big
building on Regent Street,

41:24.360 --> 41:26.870
Portland Place,
you're not allowed in there

41:26.920 --> 41:30.870
even if you're BBC staff unless
you've been on a half-hour

41:30.920 --> 41:34.470
health and safety course on
how to operate the building.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.910
I started the course.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.630
A lady with an eight-page document
arrived to talk me through it.

41:39.680 --> 41:43.790
Page one was a picture of
a fire alarm, red fire alarm box.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.590
It said, "This is a fire alarm."

41:45.640 --> 41:50.590
Page two, a graphic of a green sign
with a man running like this

41:50.640 --> 41:53.390
with the word "exit".
"That's an emergency exit."

41:53.440 --> 41:55.430
At that point, I was taken off
to do some filming.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.790
I still haven't...
You haven't completed the course?

41:57.840 --> 42:00.910
I still haven't. I still have to be
escorted around Broadcasting House

42:00.960 --> 42:03.310
in case I'm confused
by a light fitting!

42:03.360 --> 42:06.830
Or something of that nature.
It is stupid.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.350
I'm longing to see something
that satirises it,

42:09.400 --> 42:13.550
but again, how are you doing it?
You must be the world's busiest man.

42:13.600 --> 42:16.470
Presumably you drove very quickly
around the lap,

42:16.520 --> 42:19.190
so you could get home more quickly?

42:19.240 --> 42:21.430
No, I'm not a speed merchant.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.870
At the beginning,
when The Stig took me around,

42:23.920 --> 42:26.470
I was really terrified,
being in the passenger seat,

42:26.520 --> 42:28.710
and I thought,
"I'll never be able to do this."

42:28.760 --> 42:30.390
By the end,
as your guys will tell you,

42:30.440 --> 42:32.750
I refused to get out, I wanted
to go again and again.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.670
Who here would like to see the lap?

42:34.720 --> 42:36.590
AUDIENCE: Yes!

42:36.640 --> 42:38.520
Play the tape, let's have a look.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.830
The car, fresh after its long rest.

42:43.880 --> 42:45.160
Come on, son!

42:46.640 --> 42:49.750
Look at the lines, streaming down.

42:49.800 --> 42:53.830
That is wet, really is pouring down,
and that's odd for England(!)

42:53.880 --> 42:57.430
If you're watching abroad,
it's never normally like that here.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.470
Where's the white line? Oh, there.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.910
LAUGHTER

43:00.960 --> 43:04.230
You may laugh, but it is
quite tricky to see the line

43:04.280 --> 43:06.590
when the track is soaking wet.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.080
It's really steamy.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.280
Hmm?

43:14.400 --> 43:18.310
You need to get that sort of thing
sorted out before you set off.

43:18.360 --> 43:21.550
Even though the lines are invisible
from behind the wheel,

43:21.600 --> 43:24.470
you've done a pretty good job.
That's not bad.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.920
Woohoo! Perfectly judged.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.800
Must remember to get some milk.

43:32.880 --> 43:35.830
Worse than Kimi Raikkonen
for not paying attention,

43:35.880 --> 43:38.000
but no worries through there at all.

43:39.440 --> 43:42.910
Tyres, speedy, moving them
about nicely.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.790
Oh, that is quick!

43:44.840 --> 43:47.030
On the wrong side of the road there,
but never mind.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.230
It's nicely done,
and you haven't gone off
on the second to last corner.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.670
Gambon, a bit of understeer.
That car grips well.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.390
And there we are. Across the line!

43:55.440 --> 43:58.880
APPLAUSE

44:02.040 --> 44:03.600
Now, ha-ha!

44:08.880 --> 44:12.510
Just realised that's the first ever
wet lap we've had in that car.

44:12.560 --> 44:15.230
Nobody else has driven around
in the rain.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.990
Bearing that in mind,
where do you think you've come?

44:19.040 --> 44:24.830
Well, I suspect...between
Ron Howard and Steven Tyler,

44:24.880 --> 44:26.350
bearing in mind it's wet.

44:26.400 --> 44:30.870
Somewhere between 1.50 and 1.51
is what you think you've done.

44:30.920 --> 44:32.440
Well, you did it in...

44:41.120 --> 44:44.550
1.50.1.

44:44.600 --> 44:49.110
Which means you're the first guest
ever to guess correctly...

44:49.160 --> 44:51.840
Wait, wait, wait!

44:54.000 --> 44:58.510
You just put Steven Tyler...
I'll cross it out, wrong.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.920
A very professional show.
There, look, correct!

45:02.680 --> 45:05.350
To be brutally honest with you,
The Stig did say

45:05.400 --> 45:06.870
that you have a natural talent

45:06.920 --> 45:10.790
and if it had been dry you would
have been very close to the top.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.030
Well, that's an accolade then. It is.

45:13.080 --> 45:16.790
I'll go away happy, thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much, Hugh Bonneville!

45:16.840 --> 45:18.110
Thank you.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.800
CHEERING

45:23.680 --> 45:26.950
Right, tonight the boys and girls
who produce Top Gear

45:27.000 --> 45:30.110
are on a mission to prove that
the hot hatchbacks of our era

45:30.160 --> 45:33.950
were rubbish. Yeah.
Things are not going well for me,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.270
cos I've slightly damaged
the engine... Ruined.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.350
LAUGHTER

45:37.400 --> 45:40.590
Slightly damaged. Whatever... Damaged
the engine in my Nova and it's

45:40.640 --> 45:43.390
on the back of a tow truck.
But despite this we had been told

45:43.440 --> 45:46.150
to report to somewhere
we couldn't pronounce...

45:46.200 --> 45:47.560
in Wales.

45:51.240 --> 45:55.240
Having crossed the Severn Estuary
we soon arrived at the location.

45:56.520 --> 46:01.150
HE STRUGGLES TO PRONOUNCE:
Trefniadaeth Seilwaith Amddiffyn

46:01.200 --> 46:04.910
Man Hyfforddi Caerwent.

46:04.960 --> 46:08.390
And here on this huge, abandoned
army base crisscrossed

46:08.440 --> 46:12.430
with more than 30 miles
of deserted roads,

46:12.480 --> 46:15.870
we received the details
of our challenge.

46:15.920 --> 46:18.550
Oh, hello. Why is it an envelope
and not a text this time?

46:18.600 --> 46:21.310
That's a good point.
We're in Wales - no signal.

46:21.360 --> 46:24.150
Ahh! Yeah!
We're back to the old ways.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.710
Come on then, what is it?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.430
"Because the drivers of '80s
hatchbacks were irresponsible

46:28.480 --> 46:31.950
"and stupid they were often chased
by the 50."

46:32.000 --> 46:36.110
Er, James, it means the 5-0,
as in Hawaii 5-0, it's the police.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.070
Yeah, whatever.
Well, anyway. The 50!

46:38.120 --> 46:40.550
Anyway...
"You will now go head-to-head with

46:40.600 --> 46:43.710
"the Top Gear Police Department.
Each of you will take it in turns

46:43.760 --> 46:46.550
"to drive your own car
while the other two will use

46:46.600 --> 46:49.270
"a selection of police vehicles
to try and stop you."

46:49.320 --> 46:51.630
That sounds quite good.
It does sound good.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.910
Tell you what, Hammond,
you go first.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.550
Erm, good, yes.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.320
I might need a minute.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.150
While Hammond mended his car,

47:00.200 --> 47:05.630
James and I broke out
the TGPD pursuit vehicles

47:05.680 --> 47:09.040
and slipped into
our police uniforms.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.390
OK, Hammond, are you ready?

47:15.440 --> 47:20.190
Yes, I am. This is going to be good.
In 3, 2, 1...

47:20.240 --> 47:22.030
start the clock.

47:22.080 --> 47:23.800
ENGINE FAILS TO START

47:25.320 --> 47:27.630
STARTS CREAKILY

47:27.680 --> 47:29.590
We are off.

47:29.640 --> 47:34.190
CREAKS AND GRINDS

47:34.240 --> 47:36.790
Yep, it's just warming up.
SIREN WAILS

47:36.840 --> 47:38.430
Here we go...

47:38.480 --> 47:42.630
Ha-ha!

47:42.680 --> 47:45.110
Excuse me, sir, my moustache
would like a word with you,

47:45.160 --> 47:48.110
if you'd like to step out of the
vehicle. You're nicked, sunshine.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.390
What did I do? How long?
Eight seconds.

47:50.440 --> 47:52.030
Do you know, another fault...

47:52.080 --> 47:54.470
Did it? Very similar. Did it?

47:54.520 --> 47:58.110
It manifested itself similarly to
the last one that one I repaired.

47:58.160 --> 48:02.190
Tell that to the judge...
Yes...sunshine. Right.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.070
Jeremy then put on the yobbo outfit

48:04.120 --> 48:07.990
and lined up his velvet Golf
on the start line.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.350
3, 2, 1...begin...

COPS AND ROBBERS MUSIC

48:15.080 --> 48:16.550
SIRENS WAIL

48:16.600 --> 48:19.920
And there we are, eight seconds.
I've already beaten Hammond.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.440
He's getting away, constable!

48:29.720 --> 48:31.360
Yes. Live with this...!

48:33.640 --> 48:36.310
You see, what we're learning
straight away is that

48:36.360 --> 48:41.840
a modern police Astra is no match
for a 1980s hot hatchback.

48:43.680 --> 48:46.040
TYRES SQUEAL

48:47.040 --> 48:51.110
And it wasn't just the Astras
that were causing problems.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.590
Recent figures say that in London

48:53.640 --> 48:57.550
12 police cars
are crashed every day.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.230
And the reason is, it's because
they are driving in high-energy

49:01.280 --> 49:05.640
difficult situations while under
the influence of the moustache.

49:07.920 --> 49:11.550
Got a moustache, got a moustache,
got a moustache.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.160
TYRES SQUEAL

49:16.560 --> 49:18.560
Oh, he's lost it!

49:19.640 --> 49:23.360
Totally distracted
by his face decoration.

49:24.640 --> 49:29.430
MUSIC: "Miami Vice Theme"
by Jan Hammer

49:29.480 --> 49:31.910
With the Astras
unable to close the gap...

49:31.960 --> 49:33.400
Come on!

49:34.480 --> 49:36.160
..the chase went on...

49:37.520 --> 49:39.270
..and on...

49:39.320 --> 49:40.960
and on...

49:47.000 --> 49:48.230
MUSIC CONTINUES

49:48.280 --> 49:52.510
The next morning, the weather
had become extremely Welsh.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.840
But still, the Golf was uncaught.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.830
This isn't working, sir.

49:57.880 --> 50:00.270
No, I agree, I think
we're going to have to break out

50:00.320 --> 50:02.960
the Top Gear Police Department
magnetron of justice.

50:05.080 --> 50:08.160
If anything could stop
the miscreant, it was this.

50:10.040 --> 50:14.400
A giant crane with a seven-kilowatt
magnet suspended from its arm.

50:16.440 --> 50:20.920
A machine that could render
any vehicle immobile in moments.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.160
Right, let's go get him.

50:28.160 --> 50:30.720
Soon, the trap was set.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.830
Mmm, what's this...?

50:35.880 --> 50:38.190
Arming magnet.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.800
MAGNET FIZZING

50:49.600 --> 50:51.520
Here he comes...

50:53.560 --> 50:55.120
RICHARD CHUCKLES

51:02.720 --> 51:06.430
Blithering idiots. Do they not
realise you can't use a magnet

51:06.480 --> 51:08.160
to pick up velvet?

51:09.960 --> 51:11.990
There was only one thing for it -

51:12.040 --> 51:15.960
unleash the TGPD
remote-controlled car of death.

51:17.320 --> 51:19.960
Target vehicle identified
and located.

51:21.600 --> 51:23.440
Where the hell are they?

51:24.520 --> 51:29.070
How can this be a police chase when
they aren't chasing me any more?

51:29.120 --> 51:30.790
Target acquired...

51:30.840 --> 51:32.960
BEEPING

51:35.840 --> 51:39.550
Sir, you might want to
put your fingers in your ears.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.710
I don't know where those two are
or what they're plotting

51:42.760 --> 51:44.990
but it won't work.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.310
BEEPING

51:47.360 --> 51:50.310
This car is simply...

51:50.360 --> 51:51.400
invincib...

52:05.120 --> 52:07.110
Bigger than I was expecting,
constable.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.680
Yes, sir, it was, sir.

52:13.240 --> 52:18.030
So, it turns out that velvet
is impervious to magnets,

52:18.080 --> 52:20.760
but it IS pervious to dynamite.

52:22.760 --> 52:25.950
Nevertheless, I felt confident
that James would not be able

52:26.000 --> 52:31.150
to beat my evasion time
of 14 hours and 22 minutes.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.710
In...3, 2, 1...

52:34.760 --> 52:36.320
start the clock.

52:38.320 --> 52:39.550
SIRENS WAIL

52:39.600 --> 52:42.990
However, as he set off it
became clear he'd come up

52:43.040 --> 52:44.640
with an unusual plan...

52:46.440 --> 52:47.880
What is he doing?

52:50.160 --> 52:54.390
Now, the thing is, viewers, whenever
you watch Police Camera Action

52:54.440 --> 52:57.190
or see a real police chase, the
person trying to get away is always

52:57.240 --> 52:59.790
going ludicrously fast,
but, actually, what's the point?

52:59.840 --> 53:02.670
You'd just panic
and have an accident

53:02.720 --> 53:04.510
and that's the end of that,

53:04.560 --> 53:06.830
but if you just do normal speed,

53:06.880 --> 53:09.000
they still can't get you
out of the car, can they?

53:11.960 --> 53:14.110
Keen to prove him wrong,

53:14.160 --> 53:17.510
I initiated the TGPD
anti-terrorism move.

53:17.560 --> 53:19.120
Here we go.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.640
Pushing, pushing.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.640
Got him.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.400
He's just driven off!

53:35.600 --> 53:39.710
'As the hours crawled by,
we tried many things.'

53:39.760 --> 53:41.680
Stop him, Constable!

53:42.520 --> 53:43.750
How's that going to help?

53:43.800 --> 53:45.270
I've fallen off the bonnet!

53:45.320 --> 53:47.990
What are you going to do
if the doors are locked?

53:48.040 --> 53:49.880
You can't pull a man
out of a car.

53:54.200 --> 53:55.560
This is an arrest.

53:58.680 --> 54:02.830
'Happily, though, after many hours of
tedious pursuit...'

54:02.880 --> 54:06.190
Weaving, weaving...

54:06.240 --> 54:11.950
'..James finally made a mistake.'
Oh, crikey, this is a dead end.

54:12.000 --> 54:16.030
Yes, his sense of direction
has let him down. A-ha!

54:16.080 --> 54:17.910
In we go, yes.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.150
LOUD BANG
Bollocks!

54:20.200 --> 54:22.560
We've got him! We finally have him.

54:23.720 --> 54:26.360
We don't have him,
he's closed my door.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.910
He's done it again.

54:31.960 --> 54:36.190
And now look.
I've damaged a police car.

54:36.240 --> 54:40.910
'This meant I was now delayed
with police paperwork.'

54:40.960 --> 54:46.110
"I were in pursuit of a pleb...

54:46.160 --> 54:49.750
"IC1, male.

54:49.800 --> 54:56.320
"He did crash into me at speed."

54:57.440 --> 54:59.760
I'm going to get that bastard!

55:05.760 --> 55:10.110
While Jeremy had been
finessing his statement, I decided

55:10.160 --> 55:16.750
it was time to skewer May
with the TGPD prongs of doom.

55:16.800 --> 55:18.760
SIREN BLARES

55:23.160 --> 55:27.270
It's a heavy, high-mobility
engineer excavator,

55:27.320 --> 55:29.920
built by JCB for the military.

55:31.880 --> 55:38.350
It weighs 13.5 tonnes, but it's got
a 6.7 litre straight-six turbo-diesel

55:38.400 --> 55:40.680
and it can do 63mph.

55:42.520 --> 55:45.150
James May, you've had it!

55:45.200 --> 55:47.160
Wherever you are.

55:49.440 --> 55:55.040
'James had vanished. But we had
just the thing to find him again.'

55:56.920 --> 56:03.560
The time has come, I think,
to deploy the Top Gear Police
Department drone of intrusiveness.

56:05.560 --> 56:13.270
'With its military-spec nose-mounted
reconnaissance camera, it would
track down May in a heartbeat.'

56:13.320 --> 56:14.880
Here we go.

56:18.480 --> 56:21.680
The drone of intrusiveness
has crashed.

56:24.400 --> 56:29.280
'Eventually I got the drone airborne
and begun the hunt for OJ May.'

56:37.720 --> 56:40.270
Wait a minute.

56:40.320 --> 56:43.080
You sneaky little...

56:44.640 --> 56:48.030
James was hiding
in an abandoned garage bay,

56:48.080 --> 56:50.750
but if he thought he was safe there,

56:50.800 --> 56:53.120
he had another think coming.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.470
Welcome, everyone,
to the Top Gear Police Department

57:00.520 --> 57:02.800
eaty thing of devastation.

57:05.040 --> 57:08.190
This was designed primarily
for mine clearance, but in the TGPD,

57:08.240 --> 57:14.040
we use it in
a rather different way.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.350
There is Constable Hammond.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.840
The enemy, behind that wall,
no idea what is coming.

57:29.160 --> 57:31.470
Engaging flails!

57:31.520 --> 57:34.360
Flails engaged!

57:36.840 --> 57:40.840
I'm not sure he should be
operating that thing.

57:45.520 --> 57:48.080
DRILLING

57:52.000 --> 57:53.080
Yes, look at that!

58:14.120 --> 58:16.230
He's not where...

58:16.280 --> 58:18.880
What he isn't, sir, is there.

58:22.080 --> 58:24.470
Situation update:
in three minutes' time,

58:24.520 --> 58:29.320
I will have beaten Jeremy's record
on the run at a reasonable speed.

58:30.520 --> 58:33.600
But the TGPD toy box
wasn't empty yet.

58:37.440 --> 58:40.840
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

58:46.560 --> 58:49.710
Hello, it looks like
Constable Hammond

58:49.760 --> 58:52.350
has got the hang of tank driving.

58:52.400 --> 58:55.480
The first thing you need to know is,
I have an erection!

58:58.040 --> 59:00.470
Coming at you, James May!

59:00.520 --> 59:04.950
Oh, no, the Top Gear Police
Department tank of righteousness
is right on my tail.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.950
What am I going to do?

59:07.000 --> 59:09.160
I know.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.270
Easy.

59:15.320 --> 59:16.840
Right!

59:20.200 --> 59:21.640
Oh, hang on a minute.

59:23.640 --> 59:26.190
He's stopped, he's given up!

59:26.240 --> 59:27.760
LOUD EXPLOSION

59:46.360 --> 59:50.480
And on that bombshell...
back to the studio.

59:52.720 --> 59:54.760
APPLAUSE

59:58.600 --> 01:00:04.350
It's interesting, an important
question was raised in that film.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.590
Because if you have a moustache,
how do you concentrate

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.110
on doing anything other than
having a moustache?

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.790
I know, I felt like I was the
life-support machine for a moustache.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.590
If you're a bomb disposal man,
and you have to defuse a bomb,

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.190
you are thinking,
"I have a moustache."

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:26.470
How did Nigel Mansell win a Formula
One world championship? I know!

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.470
You don't have a moustache, sir,

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.270
but let me show you
what it's like to have one.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.870
It's like that. What do you do
for a living? Transport manager.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.750
You couldn't be a transport manager
if I was doing that to you.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.400
LAUGHTER

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.750
Anyway, we must get on
because I have received a text -

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.230
the results of
the car evasion challenge.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:55.430
Jeremy Clarkson, 14 hours
22 minutes. Richard Hammock...

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.190
Autocorrect again?

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.830
Yes. Eight seconds. Thank you.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.590
James May, 14 hours, 21 minutes.

01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:06.070
Oh, blast! There you are.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.870
Hang on, so the Fiesta
won the supermarket sweep,

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.950
the Golf won the police chase

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.070
and the Nova won the hill climb.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.790
That means that each of the cars
is a winner. Precisely.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.710
Which means that the older
hot hatchback

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.870
is better than the modern one.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.630
Which means we were right, and on
that bombshell, it's time to end.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.430
Thank you very much for watching.
Good night!

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.120
