00:04.283 --> 00:06.822
The man you asked me
about, Philip Genovese?

00:06.942 --> 00:08.628
- Yeah?
- He's back, too.

00:10.937 --> 00:13.627
Is he the one from New York,
the one you were chasing?

00:13.636 --> 00:14.716
When he does get back,

00:14.734 --> 00:17.130
we've got something very
special planned for him.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.450
I mean his little friend here.

00:18.474 --> 00:19.754
What do you want?

00:19.874 --> 00:22.709
Leave Shari out of it!
She's not a part of it!

00:23.486 --> 00:24.904
She is now, sport.

00:24.914 --> 00:28.435
Come on... we both knew
it was gonna end this way.

00:30.109 --> 00:31.692
He runs a trafficking ring.

00:31.714 --> 00:32.808
- Drugs?
- People.

00:32.834 --> 00:35.354
Wait! Arabela, stay with Genovese
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:35.394 --> 00:37.043
He's dangerous, never forget that.

00:37.074 --> 00:38.607
My boss is on his way. I'll be fine.

00:38.634 --> 00:40.731
- Inspector Seeger.
- Just finishing off my notes.

00:40.753 --> 00:42.290
So everything is all right in here, huh?

00:42.314 --> 00:43.554
Absolutely perfect.

00:47.133 --> 00:49.145
- What happened?
- It was my boss.

00:49.194 --> 00:51.720
He attacked me. He helped him.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.434
Hey, garbage boy. Guess
who's out of the hospital?

00:54.554 --> 00:56.274
I can't wait for round two.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:06.120 --> 01:07.386
There's the door.

01:11.674 --> 01:12.674
On me.

01:16.594 --> 01:19.074
Remember, there's supposed to
be a dozen girls in that trailer.

01:19.234 --> 01:21.533
If it jumps off, nobody
fires at the trailer.

01:21.554 --> 01:22.754
Draw the skels away.

01:23.634 --> 01:24.674
Let's roll.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.554
Two, one, go!

01:45.994 --> 01:46.994
Hold.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.314
What are we doing?

01:49.081 --> 01:52.255
- This is too easy.
- Not necessarily.

01:55.674 --> 01:56.956
Mace...

02:05.587 --> 02:07.389
Cammarata, light that cigar.

02:22.804 --> 02:24.716
Okay, this is a setup.

02:24.754 --> 02:26.911
Come on, back up. Slowly.

02:28.634 --> 02:31.794
Let's get the Boom Squad in here,
find out what the hell is going on.

02:36.542 --> 02:38.527
You look like you want to jump.

02:39.423 --> 02:42.588
- Out of my skin.
- It's only been a few days.

02:43.081 --> 02:45.034
You promised you'd listen to the doctors.

02:45.274 --> 02:46.994
I thought they would be more reasonable.

02:47.154 --> 02:48.468
You need to heal.

02:48.474 --> 02:50.233
Which I could be doing at my desk.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.634
But you wouldn't stay at your desk.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.825
Merci, Monsieur. See?

02:55.099 --> 02:57.194
Even Michel thinks you should stay at home.

02:57.212 --> 03:00.413
No, I just declared that he
wouldn't stay at his desk.

03:00.752 --> 03:03.111
I made no assessment beyond that.

03:04.346 --> 03:06.578
If I'd known that would be the response,

03:06.594 --> 03:08.435
I would have brought
them two weeks earlier.

03:08.474 --> 03:09.825
That's for coming to visit.

03:09.834 --> 03:12.093
He really is going out of his mind.

03:13.634 --> 03:15.724
You're going out of your mind?

03:17.234 --> 03:18.714
I need to ask you something.

03:19.434 --> 03:20.554
Anything.

03:21.514 --> 03:22.514
Why?

03:23.114 --> 03:24.194
Why what?

03:25.776 --> 03:29.594
Trying to kill me for stopping a
drug operation I understand perfectly.

03:30.074 --> 03:31.694
But I keep thinking about this:

03:31.714 --> 03:33.422
why did Dimitrov

03:33.450 --> 03:36.532
take Rebecca and me hostage?

03:37.514 --> 03:38.514
Why?

03:39.394 --> 03:41.224
I'm sorry, Louis.

03:41.910 --> 03:44.599
I... I don't know, yet.

03:46.173 --> 03:47.733
We've cleared all the laser trip beams.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.174
And there's definitely a bomb?

03:49.182 --> 03:51.980
Bomb is an understatement. There's
enough explosive in that truck

03:51.994 --> 03:54.034
to blow this whole block
back to the Stone Age.

03:54.154 --> 03:56.514
This entire thing was a setup.
There are no girls at all?

03:56.674 --> 03:57.714
I didn't say that.

03:57.752 --> 03:59.912
One of my guys thought he heard
something in one of the trucks.

03:59.914 --> 04:01.968
So we put up the portable x-ray.

04:02.594 --> 04:04.090
Looks like people inside.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.983
The girls are in there?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.794
You took care of all the lasers?

04:09.074 --> 04:11.914
And it seems the plastique is
just under the frame of the truck.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.837
And all the doors are safe?

04:15.066 --> 04:16.314
I said "seems."

04:16.338 --> 04:18.103
Aw, dammit, we can't just...

04:18.569 --> 04:19.803
Okay.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.029
Everybody, find cover or get out of here.

04:26.060 --> 04:28.164
It's really not a good idea.

04:28.194 --> 04:30.935
Yeah, those words will
probably be on my tombstone.

04:31.714 --> 04:33.368
But please, not today.

05:54.231 --> 05:56.194
You know, you saved a
lot of lives here today.

05:56.206 --> 05:59.514
I got four dead girls and two barely
breathing, and no idea who they are.

05:59.554 --> 06:01.034
We haven't saved their lives yet.

06:01.045 --> 06:02.314
I didn't just mean them.

06:12.034 --> 06:13.434
Genovese...

06:15.842 --> 06:17.234
Son of a bitch.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.154
Amanda?

06:45.194 --> 06:46.914
Did you forget to tell me something?

06:48.474 --> 06:50.314
I have no idea what you're talking about.

06:50.358 --> 06:53.532
The last we heard around here, you
had Phillip Genovese in custody.

06:55.754 --> 06:56.754
Yeah.

06:57.394 --> 06:58.834
Yeah, but not anymore.

06:58.954 --> 07:01.563
How did you get this
number? Wait, wait, why?

07:01.594 --> 07:05.652
He just tried to kill me
and an entire raid team.

07:06.674 --> 07:08.725
- What?
- Yup.

07:09.457 --> 07:13.143
He's in New York, and it looks
like he's settling old scores.

07:19.394 --> 07:21.128
- Tommy?
- You quit?

07:21.704 --> 07:23.478
I was going to call you.

07:23.954 --> 07:26.554
Is this because they're saying
your boss was some kind of hero?

07:26.597 --> 07:28.719
- That's part of it.
- That's not a reason to quit,

07:28.994 --> 07:30.256
that's a reason to start screaming,

07:30.274 --> 07:31.650
"That's a load of shite" from the rooftops.

07:31.674 --> 07:33.119
- It's complicated.
- No, it's not.

07:33.354 --> 07:35.834
There aren't that many good
cops, Seeger. You can't quit.

07:36.695 --> 07:40.794
I believe my colleagues murdered
my boss and called it suicide,

07:41.095 --> 07:44.277
a man so corrupt he helped
another murderer escape.

07:44.554 --> 07:46.634
But what they're saying is a hero died.

07:46.655 --> 07:47.908
None of it is true,

07:48.114 --> 07:51.120
but it will be. It will be
official, and it will be true.

07:51.314 --> 07:53.233
I'm sorry, Tommy. I just...

07:53.443 --> 07:56.892
I can't devote my life to
a system capable of that.

08:22.563 --> 08:25.124
- Major, hi!
- I do not need help.

08:25.154 --> 08:26.587
Let me give you a hand.

08:30.393 --> 08:31.834
Here, lean on me, mate.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.859
You make me feel very, very old.

08:36.979 --> 08:40.061
Young people don't make
you feel old, Louis,

08:40.472 --> 08:42.754
it's old age that does that.

08:42.874 --> 08:46.714
Torn ligaments and bruised ribs don't help.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.154
No, I imagine not.

08:48.183 --> 08:51.072
- Should you even be here, Sir?
- The doctors paroled me.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.434
I promised to only do
things with no movement,

08:53.554 --> 08:57.100
a promise I can keep since you
all created enough paperwork for me

08:57.394 --> 08:58.514
to last a month.

08:58.714 --> 09:01.838
I'm sure there's a "Thank you for
rescuing me" in there somewhere.

09:02.954 --> 09:04.074
Anyone seen Carl?

09:04.314 --> 09:05.474
Not since we came back.

09:05.506 --> 09:08.114
He's been at the hospital with
the injured girl from the carnival.

09:08.834 --> 09:10.683
- Tommy?
- Aye.

09:11.387 --> 09:14.234
- Thanks for rescuing me.
- You're more than welcome, sir.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.834
Oh, you are here.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.514
I wish everyone was less surprised.

09:20.716 --> 09:23.231
No, I mean, I just took
a phone call for you,

09:23.274 --> 09:25.481
from the States, NYPD, a cop named...

09:25.514 --> 09:28.514
- Andrews?
- Yeah, Amanda Andrews.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.154
- Yeah.
- Hold on.

09:38.332 --> 09:40.079
They should be coming through now.

09:40.363 --> 09:43.747
The doctors here say that the four
dead girls appear to have suffocated

09:43.754 --> 09:45.842
in the trailers after their beatings.

09:46.154 --> 09:48.210
They're not sure why
these two even survived.

09:49.674 --> 09:51.732
I appreciate your help IDing them.

09:51.754 --> 09:53.854
I have put them through
everything that we have here,

09:53.874 --> 09:56.798
but they are so disfigured it's impossible.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.594
All the paperwork will be done,

09:58.754 --> 10:01.074
and your team will have all
the authority they need, Louis.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.714
I will do what I can.

10:03.165 --> 10:06.314
I hope your device is as good as
Louis has told me, Kommissar Berger.

10:06.514 --> 10:08.149
Yeah, me too.

10:08.474 --> 10:10.198
- See you soon.
- Goodbye.

10:11.789 --> 10:15.074
Okay, you all know what to do.
You have 20 minutes to gear up.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.991
That was quick.

10:21.457 --> 10:24.292
Ensconcing yourself in a new adventure.

10:25.354 --> 10:26.474
Could I say no?

10:26.954 --> 10:28.234
No, you could not.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.754
I need to talk to you,

10:32.533 --> 10:35.434
Louis. It concerns Rebecca.

10:39.310 --> 10:40.911
You guys going somewhere?

10:41.031 --> 10:42.941
I'm gonna see New York for the first time.

10:43.061 --> 10:44.533
We have a case.

10:45.237 --> 10:46.474
In New York?

10:46.774 --> 10:48.434
Yeah, Genovese turned up there.

10:48.768 --> 10:51.434
- How do you know that?
- The Major will explain it.

10:51.438 --> 10:52.954
Is that right?

11:00.554 --> 11:02.901
- He doesn't seem happy.
- Does he ever?

11:15.714 --> 11:16.897
You okay?

11:17.017 --> 11:18.159
Yeah.

11:18.279 --> 11:19.759
I just...

11:21.423 --> 11:23.948
I told Anne Marie I would
show her New York one day.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.487
Excuse me, gentlemen.

11:28.776 --> 11:30.981
Why does the team think
they're going to New York?

11:31.630 --> 11:34.081
- I'll let you get to it, Major.
- Thank you, Dorn.

11:34.114 --> 11:35.362
Hickman...

11:36.559 --> 11:37.954
good work in London.

11:38.526 --> 11:40.163
Congratulations.

11:40.547 --> 11:41.800
Thank you, sir.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.792
The team thinks they are going
to New York because they are.

11:45.167 --> 11:47.636
Six European girls were found in New York,

11:47.674 --> 11:49.674
victims of a trafficking ring.

11:49.703 --> 11:50.874
Four are dead.

11:50.994 --> 11:54.634
Those two were found so badly
beaten they cannot be identified.

11:55.135 --> 11:58.874
NYPD asked us to identify
them and get them home.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.730
Amanda is your contact there? Does she...

12:01.931 --> 12:03.687
- call you about me?
- Yes.

12:03.714 --> 12:06.514
So did she tell you that
I'm... I'm going there also?

12:06.533 --> 12:08.514
She told me Genovese tried to kill her.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.314
She didn't need to tell me you were going.

12:10.328 --> 12:13.400
The team does not need to be involved
with this. This is my fight, Louis.

12:13.401 --> 12:14.627
They don't seem so worried about it.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.874
Yeah, well, they should be.

12:16.034 --> 12:17.234
Your ticket is ready.

12:17.474 --> 12:18.615
Flight is in two hours.

12:18.634 --> 12:21.434
The ICC is not responsible for this, Louis.

12:21.469 --> 12:23.794
The ICC team was requested,

12:24.234 --> 12:25.594
not just some of them.

12:35.659 --> 12:37.781
Get out of the way, man! Asshole!

12:37.794 --> 12:40.388
Excuse you, mate! Jeez, it really is ruder.

12:40.434 --> 12:42.968
You're from Belfast and you
think New Yorkers are rude?

12:42.994 --> 12:46.104
But when the Irish are rude, we do
it with a little twinkle in the eye.

12:46.105 --> 12:47.467
Yeah, like leprechauns.

12:47.474 --> 12:48.714
That's still not funny, man.

12:48.874 --> 12:49.754
Eva likes me.

12:49.791 --> 12:52.187
Yeah, but I don't think
you're that funny either.

12:52.474 --> 12:54.309
- I think you're funny, Sebastian.
- Thank you.

12:54.318 --> 12:56.212
- Yeah, when he's insulting me.
- Usually.

12:56.474 --> 12:57.274
Wow...

12:57.434 --> 12:59.874
- She ought to be here.
- What's she like?

13:01.194 --> 13:02.274
Amanda?

13:04.354 --> 13:05.716
She's like a cop.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.515
That's what she is. I
mean, what's she like?

13:08.914 --> 13:11.350
That's for not calling
when Genovese escaped.

13:12.434 --> 13:13.474
You hit me?

13:13.594 --> 13:15.514
I wanted to run you over,

13:15.634 --> 13:18.634
but transpo convinced me I don't
need another vehicle damage report.

13:19.370 --> 13:21.099
Briefing upstairs in my office,

13:21.114 --> 13:23.634
and then we'll get you to the
hospital so you can see the girls.

13:27.355 --> 13:29.203
Now, that was funny.

13:29.587 --> 13:30.827
I think I like her.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.870
Yeah, I think we're going to be friends.

13:36.130 --> 13:38.343
Yeah, I missed you, too, Mandy.

13:43.514 --> 13:44.674
They arrived.

13:44.871 --> 13:46.417
All right, stay with 'em.

13:46.454 --> 13:48.265
Let me know when they move again.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.256
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

13:51.376 --> 13:53.240
Hey, you know what they
don't have in Europe?

13:53.542 --> 13:54.914
A decent Red Hot.

13:54.932 --> 13:57.301
Run three of them through
the garden for me, would ya?

13:57.594 --> 13:58.994
I got a big day planned.

14:00.016 --> 14:01.269
A big day.

14:03.588 --> 14:06.771
I was able to get permission for you
to consult on the unidentified girls

14:06.798 --> 14:08.879
based on the unique
abilities of your machine.

14:08.884 --> 14:10.292
We believe them to be European.

14:10.311 --> 14:12.359
One of them spoke French if that helps.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.673
It cuts it down to 75 million people.

14:14.701 --> 14:17.639
- If that's her only language.
- She was asking for help.

14:17.759 --> 14:19.839
Well, then, it's probably
her native tongue.

14:19.847 --> 14:21.239
29 countries.

14:21.359 --> 14:22.737
Are we sure she isn't Canadian?

14:22.783 --> 14:25.463
Canadians are usually brought
into the U.S. in a different place.

14:25.481 --> 14:29.039
Right, Upper Peninsula, Michigan,
or Seattle through Vancouver.

14:29.159 --> 14:31.930
- They do their research.
- What about Genovese?

14:32.150 --> 14:34.279
- What about him?
- How are we going after him?

14:34.318 --> 14:35.900
You guys are going to handle the women.

14:35.928 --> 14:37.239
City's gonna have an issue

14:37.254 --> 14:39.474
with international cops
bouncing around as it is.

14:39.477 --> 14:42.037
If anyone asks what you're doing
here, these letters should help.

14:42.119 --> 14:44.159
They also have my phone number on them.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.719
Guns are okay?

14:45.724 --> 14:47.507
- Do you have badges?
- Yeah.

14:47.718 --> 14:49.062
This is America.

14:49.090 --> 14:51.159
Oh, right, Cops and Robbers, huh?

14:51.279 --> 14:53.039
Cops and Robbers.

14:54.340 --> 14:55.639
What's this?

14:55.657 --> 14:58.279
That is the organizational
chart for the trafficking gang.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.279
This how we chased Genovese down.

15:00.596 --> 15:03.079
NYPD doesn't have computers.

15:04.511 --> 15:07.399
- I prefer old school.
- As in pre-electricity.

15:07.438 --> 15:09.843
Any ideas how you're gonna find one tosser

15:09.879 --> 15:11.719
in a city of nine-million people?

15:12.075 --> 15:13.159
Yeah.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.439
I have some thoughts.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.288
After Ã‰tienne was born,
when you left The Hague,

15:20.408 --> 15:24.039
the international justice
community suffered a loss, you know.

15:25.227 --> 15:29.959
You are one of the most gifted
prosecutors I have ever worked with.

15:29.983 --> 15:31.639
Your ability to

15:32.068 --> 15:36.359
extract from those victims all the
information that we needed without

15:36.670 --> 15:39.999
tearing them apart
emotionally was remarkable.

15:40.119 --> 15:42.898
Quite, quite remarkable.

15:43.730 --> 15:45.399
Michel, I couldn't.

15:45.422 --> 15:48.799
I don't even know if I'm capable
anymore. It's been six years.

15:48.825 --> 15:50.919
- My skills...
- Your skills.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.239
You haven't lost your compassion,

15:53.359 --> 15:55.479
you haven't lost your sense of decency,

15:55.895 --> 15:58.879
and those are the qualities
that inform your skills

15:58.904 --> 16:01.399
to make you a great
prosecutor. The rest of it,

16:01.712 --> 16:04.919
well, you can brush up
on in books, for godsakes.

16:05.663 --> 16:07.519
Well, I must think about it.

16:07.538 --> 16:08.639
Yes.

16:09.962 --> 16:11.599
Yes, you must.

16:14.124 --> 16:15.879
Is there something else?

16:16.904 --> 16:18.679
Working for the Court,

16:20.416 --> 16:21.719
there are...

16:22.547 --> 16:25.199
tangential ramifications

16:25.319 --> 16:28.359
that you must take into consideration.

16:31.035 --> 16:33.413
- Yes?
- Yes.

16:33.971 --> 16:36.439
And what I'm talking about

16:37.355 --> 16:39.519
directly pertains

16:40.986 --> 16:43.119
to Ã‰tienne's death,

16:43.382 --> 16:45.719
and why that happened.

16:46.968 --> 16:48.519
Rebecca...

16:50.928 --> 16:53.239
Alexander Dimitrov...

16:56.160 --> 16:58.519
assassinated Ã‰tienne

16:59.188 --> 17:01.079
to get back at you.

17:04.446 --> 17:06.403
You the crew I'm taking
to Roosevelt Island?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.443
This is them, they have some gear up front.

17:16.794 --> 17:19.079
- Roosevelt Island?
- Yeah.

17:19.950 --> 17:22.439
I put them in City Hospital
off the beaten path.

17:23.050 --> 17:24.759
You ever go back out there?

17:26.452 --> 17:28.039
To the Island?

17:28.721 --> 17:31.479
No, not since my father died.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.279
Yeah.

17:34.182 --> 17:35.639
The funeral.

17:39.285 --> 17:41.799
One day I wasn't backing you up.

17:42.944 --> 17:44.719
A day to remember.

17:46.163 --> 17:48.066
You know I don't blame you for this, right?

17:48.074 --> 17:49.279
You don't have to.

17:53.526 --> 17:54.999
How is it?

17:55.456 --> 17:58.885
Pretty much the same as when I
left. I do less morphine, though.

17:58.886 --> 18:00.807
That's probably a good thing.

18:03.845 --> 18:06.719
Everyone is okay with them
being here, right? The kids?

18:07.092 --> 18:08.921
They're not gonna step on any toes?

18:08.940 --> 18:11.034
It's the NYPD, we have pretty big toes.

18:11.044 --> 18:13.679
Well, if there's any problem,
you know, with anyone,

18:14.300 --> 18:17.364
just... you let me know. What?

18:17.620 --> 18:20.529
I've just never... I've
never seen this on you,

18:20.649 --> 18:22.759
caring about someone else this way.

18:24.325 --> 18:26.079
- They're good.
- Mmm.

18:26.466 --> 18:27.759
Come on,

18:27.783 --> 18:29.599
let's go and mess someone's day up.

18:39.882 --> 18:41.439
Oh, my god.

18:41.711 --> 18:45.479
To plot the assassination
of a child, a mind so sick!

18:45.517 --> 18:47.033
What I did to him...

18:47.035 --> 18:49.404
Ã‰tienne did not die
because of you, Rebecca,

18:49.524 --> 18:51.719
- there was nothing...
- No, Michel,

18:52.421 --> 18:53.759
to Louis.

18:55.426 --> 18:58.461
I blamed him for more than a year.

18:58.581 --> 19:00.701
You blamed Louis for what?

19:00.821 --> 19:02.501
From the moment it...

19:03.219 --> 19:06.581
I just assumed it was his
work that had caused it.

19:07.902 --> 19:09.381
Does he know?

19:09.924 --> 19:11.501
Does he know it was me?

19:11.621 --> 19:13.461
No, not yet, no.

19:13.581 --> 19:15.261
Oh, I need to...

19:17.496 --> 19:19.101
Oh, my god.

19:20.405 --> 19:22.021
I blamed him.

19:29.988 --> 19:31.461
Major Daniel?

19:32.384 --> 19:34.141
Thanks for coming, Detective.

19:34.397 --> 19:36.261
It's not detective anymore.

19:36.829 --> 19:39.290
Tommy told me. That's a shame.

19:39.628 --> 19:41.221
Please have a seat.

19:46.328 --> 19:48.461
I will find something else to do.

19:48.505 --> 19:50.901
But you have not yet, have you?

19:51.021 --> 19:52.261
No.

19:52.381 --> 19:54.101
- Not yet.
- Good.

19:54.221 --> 19:55.766
The team is in New York

19:55.886 --> 19:58.574
trying to identify some
injured young women.

19:58.583 --> 20:02.301
If we need to look here in Europe,
I will someone to get me there.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.101
You mean, like to drive you?

20:06.111 --> 20:08.381
Yes. You just told me you were free.

20:22.250 --> 20:25.301
Am I crazy to miss the
gentle smell of urine?

20:25.305 --> 20:26.305
Yes.

20:31.674 --> 20:33.101
They're at Rollie's.

20:33.221 --> 20:36.021
Okay, you and the boys
get to that other thing.

20:36.037 --> 20:37.901
The van's ready and loaded at the shop.

20:38.213 --> 20:39.781
You're not going to need any help?

20:39.814 --> 20:42.301
For those two? I got all I need, Stosh.

20:49.398 --> 20:51.539
Hey, what the... what the...

21:03.592 --> 21:04.981
Hey, Rollie.

21:05.184 --> 21:06.701
Miss me?

21:08.769 --> 21:11.821
You've loosened a tooth.
I think it's a molar.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.741
Quit bitching, Rollie.

21:14.074 --> 21:16.013
What, do you want the street
to know you got your ass kicked

21:16.031 --> 21:17.366
by a one-armed copper?

21:17.375 --> 21:19.122
He was pretty surprised to see me.

21:19.242 --> 21:21.518
It's always a shock to see a ghost.

21:22.003 --> 21:24.436
I kind of can't believe
he tried to take me out.

21:24.473 --> 21:26.604
Well, technically, he just facilitated it.

21:26.724 --> 21:28.388
It was Genovese who made the play.

21:28.425 --> 21:30.201
One day, remind me to
tell you how much I hate

21:30.208 --> 21:31.763
when you say, "technically".

21:32.138 --> 21:33.981
Why would I remind you to nag me?

21:49.087 --> 21:51.575
Tommy, can you get that
table and put it over here?

21:51.611 --> 21:52.581
Aye.

21:52.608 --> 21:54.593
Get me the stand and the scanner.

21:56.330 --> 21:58.381
Can you tell me how this works again?

21:58.501 --> 22:01.661
Well, they can't be identified
because of the bruising and swelling

22:01.821 --> 22:03.781
but their bone structure hasn't changed.

22:03.901 --> 22:05.461
Like their cheeks?

22:05.467 --> 22:06.981
Yeah, eye sockets.

22:07.101 --> 22:08.981
The cartilage of their nose may be damaged,

22:09.017 --> 22:10.757
but I can usually adjust for that.

22:10.877 --> 22:11.941
Adjust?

22:11.953 --> 22:14.741
I'm basically taking an X-Ray
of their bones under the damage,

22:14.770 --> 22:17.301
and letting my programs
rebuild their muscle and tissue

22:17.331 --> 22:19.408
the way an age progression program does.

22:19.709 --> 22:21.621
This is not going to hurt them, right?

22:21.831 --> 22:23.541
It won't even wake them up.

22:24.675 --> 22:26.301
So basically, you're saying you are

22:26.752 --> 22:29.501
able to see what they looked
like before they were injured?

22:29.742 --> 22:32.541
Close enough so we can run them
through an Interpol database,

22:33.008 --> 22:34.661
see if they have a record.

22:34.682 --> 22:37.301
Trafficked women might
have a prostitution hit.

22:37.618 --> 22:39.141
If we're lucky.

22:53.103 --> 22:55.021
Broads are on the seventh floor.

22:55.141 --> 22:58.701
G says in and out fast and make
sure they're dead this time.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.101
Almost.

23:04.221 --> 23:05.861
She's so beautiful.

23:05.892 --> 23:07.794
She's not in any of the crime bases.

23:07.821 --> 23:08.701
Damn.

23:08.736 --> 23:11.501
We don't want the NYPD to think
we're a bunch of useless wankers.

23:11.621 --> 23:13.757
We could have the doctors secure blood

23:13.877 --> 23:16.021
and see if there's any DNA record.

23:16.141 --> 23:18.165
Okay, well, I'll take care of that.

23:18.184 --> 23:21.064
Sounds like an even wilder shot than
hoping they've got criminal records.

23:22.885 --> 23:25.701
These girls are, like,
20 years old or something?

23:25.912 --> 23:29.101
Aren't they more likely on Facebook
than on a criminal database?

23:30.440 --> 23:31.621
Damn.

23:31.741 --> 23:33.501
You can get into Facebook?

23:33.988 --> 23:36.961
I don't have to get into it.
It's called social networking.

23:36.998 --> 23:38.763
It's meant to be accessed.

23:39.202 --> 23:41.381
You can run a photo through the site itself

23:41.388 --> 23:43.741
and see if it matches
any photos already posted?

23:43.767 --> 23:45.169
I'm supposed to know
what any of that means?

23:45.193 --> 23:47.381
- What, you don't Facebook?
- Men don't Facebook.

23:47.389 --> 23:48.883
I check my page about ten times a day.

23:48.907 --> 23:51.381
I'm very disappointed
in you sometimes, Berger.

23:51.501 --> 23:54.331
Okay, I'll go and see if
I can talk to the doctor.

23:54.358 --> 23:55.950
We should try everything.

24:16.427 --> 24:18.384
Yes... They're sisters.

24:19.079 --> 24:22.043
Marie and Charlotte DuPuis from
Mont Saint-Martin in northern France.

24:22.052 --> 24:23.543
You got all that from Facebook?

24:23.561 --> 24:26.406
They're both tagged. Their photos
match photos from their walls.

24:27.535 --> 24:28.741
McConnell.

24:28.861 --> 24:30.781
What? Where?

24:30.800 --> 24:32.749
They're walking towards the door,

24:32.776 --> 24:34.741
four of them with automatic weapons.

24:34.761 --> 24:37.121
There are four guys with
automatic weapons outside the door.

24:37.578 --> 24:39.461
Eva, stall them for 30 seconds.

24:44.264 --> 24:45.023
Are you serious?

24:45.032 --> 24:47.213
Okay, when they start to come in
the room, push back on the door.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.423
Might just give us the shock we need. Oh...

24:49.543 --> 24:50.901
be careful, mate.

24:51.021 --> 24:53.411
I'm not the one going out of the window.

24:58.177 --> 25:02.101
Oh, God, pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen. Amen!

25:04.616 --> 25:07.982
This is a bad idea. Don't
look down, don't look down.

25:08.503 --> 25:11.622
Oh, why'd you look down? You're so stupid.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.317
Come on, come on, come on...

25:23.741 --> 25:25.186
Do it, do it.

25:31.257 --> 25:32.421
Scusi?

25:32.748 --> 25:33.955
Salve.

25:34.248 --> 25:35.541
What?

25:38.876 --> 25:40.193
- She's Italian.
- Italian?

25:41.318 --> 25:42.781
Lady, we're working here.

25:43.824 --> 25:45.221
Police!

25:45.232 --> 25:48.141
Drop your weapons! Drop
your weapons, now! Drop them.

25:48.662 --> 25:50.381
Drop your weapon now.

25:51.855 --> 25:53.581
Better listen to the lady.

25:53.701 --> 25:55.381
All right, all right.

25:56.940 --> 25:59.181
Where the heck are you cops from?

26:05.163 --> 26:06.301
Hey!

26:07.001 --> 26:08.781
You didn't fire a shot?

26:09.233 --> 26:12.283
Well, in Europe it's different.
Not all cops and robbers.

26:12.288 --> 26:13.901
Yeah, but if they'd gave me a reason,

26:13.916 --> 26:16.741
I'd have blown their asses all to
hell, let the Devil sort them out.

26:19.414 --> 26:21.741
Don't let these guys think
they're any tougher than us.

26:21.755 --> 26:24.541
"Blow their asses to hell and
let the Devil sort them out"?

26:24.554 --> 26:27.728
I'm pretty sure it's from Die
Hard 2. John McClane. Irish.

26:27.746 --> 26:29.621
Ah, Irish-American.

26:29.741 --> 26:32.181
- Yeah, but the attitude's all Irish.
- Okay.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.541
Yeah, yeah, we're all fine.

26:34.807 --> 26:37.141
Plus we potentially IDed the two girls.

26:37.167 --> 26:39.061
They may be from Normandy,
Mont Saint-Martin.

26:39.436 --> 26:41.421
Yeah, I'll send the information through.

26:42.592 --> 26:43.701
No.

26:44.174 --> 26:46.781
Sorry, I... I have no
idea where Hickman is.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.781
Made a big mistake, Rollie.

26:51.555 --> 26:53.461
Are you back on the job?

26:53.914 --> 26:55.671
Pay attention to Andrews.

26:55.689 --> 26:57.301
Is he healed or...?

26:57.326 --> 26:59.301
What? What mistake?

26:59.320 --> 27:00.646
Trying to set me up.

27:00.766 --> 27:04.301
You sent me to that trucking company
and Genovese rigged it to blow.

27:04.421 --> 27:05.541
What?

27:06.399 --> 27:08.061
What... what trucking...

27:08.072 --> 27:10.621
Why... why would I try to hurt you?

27:10.907 --> 27:12.501
I like you.

27:13.724 --> 27:16.261
Did you know that when people
lie, their blood pressure goes up?

27:16.276 --> 27:16.962
Is that right?

27:16.971 --> 27:19.901
The pressure rises,
blood goes up to the nose,

27:20.021 --> 27:23.621
makes the tissue swell.
Causes a bad itching sensation.

27:23.657 --> 27:25.141
- Like that?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.661
You're saying that I'm lying.

27:30.663 --> 27:32.341
Well, your nose is awful itchy.

27:32.364 --> 27:34.101
Here's a question for you, Rollie.

27:34.321 --> 27:36.901
Genovese spent the last
two years in Europe.

27:36.909 --> 27:39.415
How come you weren't surprised
when she said he rigged it?

27:49.459 --> 27:51.461
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.267
That's our van.

27:55.743 --> 27:57.061
Was it now?

27:57.181 --> 27:58.541
It just blew up.

27:58.871 --> 28:00.501
Lucky we caught you then, huh?

28:01.084 --> 28:02.118
Lucky?

28:02.145 --> 28:04.771
You were supposed to be back
in that thing by now, yeah?

28:05.658 --> 28:07.501
Someone wants you gone, man.

28:10.990 --> 28:14.181
So how'd you know
Genovese was back in town?

28:14.301 --> 28:15.661
What, how did I know?

28:15.678 --> 28:17.341
Answering a question with a question.

28:17.354 --> 28:18.781
Another sign of a liar.

28:19.183 --> 28:21.861
I'm just trying to
understand what you're saying.

28:21.890 --> 28:25.124
With you, Rollie, if your lips
are moving, you're lying. I mean,

28:25.314 --> 28:27.041
why would Genovese

28:27.063 --> 28:29.181
let a piece of shit like you know anything

28:29.200 --> 28:30.581
about his plans?

28:32.003 --> 28:33.832
- Give us a second, man.
- What are you doing, Tommy?

28:33.847 --> 28:34.981
Wait there.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.941
This is our chance to help Hickman.
That's their lorry just blew up.

28:38.976 --> 28:40.827
- Genovese tried to kill him, too.
- Aye,

28:40.856 --> 28:43.503
and I bet we can get this fella to
tell us where Hickman and Andrews

28:43.527 --> 28:44.811
can find him because of it.

28:44.815 --> 28:47.164
Well, we only have authorization
to identify the girls.

28:47.165 --> 28:48.705
Since when do you care about authorization?

28:48.729 --> 28:50.621
We could actually find
out where Genovese is.

28:51.913 --> 28:53.861
That was your real mistake, Rollie,

28:53.981 --> 28:56.761
never asking yourself why.

28:56.881 --> 28:58.881
Like a fish, he... he doesn't ask

28:58.901 --> 29:00.737
what the worm is doing
hanging in the water there.

29:00.761 --> 29:03.489
He just takes it, and then he's
all surprised when there's a hook.

29:03.884 --> 29:07.561
Fish, what fish? What... what
the hell are you talking about?

29:07.565 --> 29:09.441
Oh, you got the brains of a fish.

29:09.841 --> 29:12.081
Genovese told you he was bringing
those girls through New York

29:12.095 --> 29:14.026
- so he could kill me, right?
- No.

29:14.334 --> 29:15.402
No.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.102
Look, I told you, it's just
what I heard on the street.

29:18.121 --> 29:19.321
Oh, no, no. You did not hear

29:19.346 --> 29:21.601
something that specific
on the street, Rollie.

29:21.614 --> 29:24.401
Genovese knows you're a rat.
He knew you'd tell Andrews,

29:25.041 --> 29:27.081
and then he could set her
up. That's what happened.

29:27.336 --> 29:29.841
Whether she dies there or
not, either way he knows

29:29.961 --> 29:31.921
that I'm coming back
to New York to get him.

29:32.481 --> 29:33.681
You got played.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.881
You have any idea what
he's going to do to you?

29:39.241 --> 29:41.642
- Genovese just tried to kill you.
- Bullshit.

29:41.681 --> 29:43.961
- And I thought my boss was bad.
- He wouldn't.

29:43.984 --> 29:44.984
He wouldn't?

29:45.041 --> 29:47.401
So you really think he's not
going to try to kill you again?

29:47.511 --> 29:49.001
Well, here's the thing.

29:49.121 --> 29:52.201
I guess this is the only chance
you have to save yourself here.

29:52.881 --> 29:54.433
Tell us where Genovese is

29:54.641 --> 29:57.081
so we can lock him up before
he gets another shot at you.

29:59.641 --> 30:01.378
Tell her you set her up, confess.

30:01.401 --> 30:02.936
It would make you feel so much better.

30:02.965 --> 30:06.141
But I did not do that.
I would not set her up.

30:07.385 --> 30:09.761
- It's Tommy, the Irish kid.
- Better take that.

30:09.961 --> 30:10.961
Not yet.

30:16.361 --> 30:18.026
Christ, Hickman, answer your phone!

30:18.045 --> 30:19.966
Can we go a bit faster there, man?

30:20.231 --> 30:22.361
- What if he doesn't answer?
- Well, keep trying.

30:22.481 --> 30:23.681
Come on, Rollie,

30:23.961 --> 30:25.601
tell Detective Andrews you set her up.

30:25.841 --> 30:28.401
I told you, I would never set her up.

30:28.436 --> 30:31.761
- I told you that.
- Oh, Rollie, we are so close.

30:31.881 --> 30:34.241
It'll be okay. Just tell me.

30:44.561 --> 30:46.123
Fine. Okay.

30:46.921 --> 30:50.724
Look, I did not know that he was
going to try and kill you, okay?

30:51.703 --> 30:53.921
I did not know that. No way.

30:54.121 --> 30:56.881
But, yeah, I knew it was a set up.

30:58.452 --> 31:00.801
Get up, put your hands behind your back.

31:00.921 --> 31:02.041
- What?
- Stand up,

31:02.201 --> 31:03.481
put your hands behind your back.

31:03.683 --> 31:06.201
- You said it was going to be okay.
- This is okay for me.

31:06.321 --> 31:07.721
- What?
- I'm good.

31:07.745 --> 31:10.151
I'm not good. You said
it was going to be okay.

31:10.152 --> 31:12.291
- I'm really good.
- You guys are crazy.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.550
You said it was going to be okay.

31:14.670 --> 31:15.801
You just...

31:16.121 --> 31:18.241
You ca... You came here just for this?

31:18.281 --> 31:19.361
Not exactly.

31:21.601 --> 31:22.361
Tommy?

31:22.406 --> 31:24.766
Jesus, Hickman, did you
go to an informant's flat?

31:24.801 --> 31:25.841
Yeah, we're there now.

31:25.855 --> 31:27.377
You've got to get out of there now, mate.

31:27.401 --> 31:30.281
Look, I don't have time to tell you
how I know this, but it's a set-up.

31:30.327 --> 31:31.761
Genovese knows you're coming.

31:31.791 --> 31:33.538
He knew you'd go to that informant's flat!

31:33.561 --> 31:35.385
- Tommy, take it easy.
- No, listen to me, man!

31:35.401 --> 31:36.281
Calm down.

31:36.401 --> 31:38.936
- Look, Genovese is coming to kill you both!
- Tommy, stop.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.693
- No, but...!
- We know.

31:42.329 --> 31:43.841
We know that he's coming.

31:44.921 --> 31:46.041
We want him to.

32:09.735 --> 32:11.599
We are okay.

32:12.999 --> 32:13.999
Right?

32:14.759 --> 32:15.759
So far.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.719
- You got something for me?
- Oh, yeah.

32:22.532 --> 32:24.032
It's small.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.241
Well, size never matters, right?

32:27.279 --> 32:29.639
That's just what girls tell
boys to make them feel better.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.119
You ready?

32:33.690 --> 32:34.879
Hey, hey,

32:35.190 --> 32:36.190
listen,

32:36.279 --> 32:38.895
I don't care about the
broad, but that guy cop,

32:39.199 --> 32:40.199
he's mine.

32:44.479 --> 32:45.479
Go, go.

33:03.884 --> 33:05.549
All units, move in.

33:12.279 --> 33:14.559
What's going on? I don't hear anything.

33:14.679 --> 33:16.103
Drop your weapon!

33:25.666 --> 33:27.403
He's going upstairs!

33:57.759 --> 34:00.079
Perp made it to the roof of 1111 Arthur.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.639
Seal the entire neighborhood.

34:01.679 --> 34:03.481
Start going through every building.

34:09.759 --> 34:11.146
Genovese!

34:11.887 --> 34:13.039
We're here!

34:14.475 --> 34:17.091
You want to finish
everything, how about now?

34:17.375 --> 34:18.599
Right now!

34:22.139 --> 34:23.878
You really think he's going to answer you?

34:23.918 --> 34:24.918
No.

34:26.384 --> 34:28.844
- What should we do?
- You go north, I'll go south.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.056
If I say be careful, will it matter?

34:31.533 --> 34:33.119
Careful would have stayed in Europe.

35:13.342 --> 35:16.122
Drop the gun. Drop it.

35:16.519 --> 35:17.668
Drop the gun.

35:19.040 --> 35:21.053
Hey, hey. Hey.

35:22.104 --> 35:24.237
This a familiar sight, huh?

35:24.357 --> 35:28.635
Me, a rooftop, gun,
NYPD. Oh, wait a second.

35:29.279 --> 35:32.047
I'm sorry, I forgot you
weren't there that day.

35:32.366 --> 35:34.479
- Too bad for your boy.
- My boy?

35:35.385 --> 35:37.559
You went pretty far away to hide from him.

35:37.679 --> 35:38.719
Europe?

35:39.492 --> 35:40.959
I went to Europe because of you.

35:41.159 --> 35:42.675
In my line of work,

35:43.319 --> 35:45.547
there's a lot of worry
about Detective Andrews,

35:45.758 --> 35:48.968
NYPD trafficking specialist.

35:49.239 --> 35:52.655
"Specialist" suggests an
asshole like you is hard to find,

35:52.679 --> 35:53.990
or handle.

35:54.383 --> 35:55.728
I do okay.

35:56.231 --> 35:58.499
Pulled your strings pretty easy today.

35:58.839 --> 36:00.521
That's because you're out of options.

36:00.731 --> 36:02.399
- I'm out of options?
- Yeah.

36:02.414 --> 36:04.559
You really think you're
going to walk off this roof?

36:04.679 --> 36:05.839
- I do.
- You do.

36:05.959 --> 36:07.039
You know why?

36:07.270 --> 36:11.719
I think I've got a major insurance
policy right in front of me.

36:12.008 --> 36:13.810
Insurance policy?

36:14.286 --> 36:17.268
Yeah. You're a hostage.

36:18.311 --> 36:20.341
You better have a hell of
a lot more than that gun

36:20.359 --> 36:22.535
if you think you're going to
scare me into being your hostage.

36:22.559 --> 36:23.771
Is that right?

36:24.844 --> 36:27.917
My dad used to pull a gun on
me and my brother just for fun.

36:28.512 --> 36:30.524
On the weekends, when he was real drunk,

36:30.559 --> 36:32.874
he'd add a couple rounds to the mix,

36:33.599 --> 36:35.234
pull the trigger now and then.

36:36.239 --> 36:38.078
Didn't take me long to develop a real

36:38.119 --> 36:41.039
I don't give a shit attitude
about a gun to my head.

36:41.159 --> 36:42.377
Wow.

36:43.079 --> 36:44.609
That was amazing.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.941
- Now we're going to move.
- No.

36:47.679 --> 36:48.959
- Move.
- Shoot me.

36:48.981 --> 36:50.509
- Stop moving.
- No.

36:50.519 --> 36:52.091
- We're going to go now.
- No.

36:53.353 --> 36:55.457
- Shoot me.
- I said move.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.359
Better give up before someone kills you.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.759
- She is so right.
- Hey, Carl.

37:01.839 --> 37:03.639
- How are you, buddy?
- Shoot him, Carl.

37:03.652 --> 37:05.472
If you pull that trigger,
I'm going to pull mine.

37:05.479 --> 37:07.279
I don't care, Carl. Shoot him.

37:07.639 --> 37:09.239
You know, by the way you shoot,

37:09.358 --> 37:11.598
you got a better chance of
hitting this bitch anyway.

37:11.885 --> 37:14.878
- Did you just call me bitch?
- Yes, I did, bitch. Shut up.

37:14.998 --> 37:16.887
- Big mistake.
- Carl, shoot him.

37:16.918 --> 37:18.157
Hey, stop moving, I mean it...

37:18.158 --> 37:21.415
You know what? Shoot me,
and then shoot him! Do it!

37:21.424 --> 37:23.272
Stop moving. Stop moving!

37:26.290 --> 37:28.010
You want to cuff him?

37:28.348 --> 37:30.518
I still haven't figured out
how to do that one handed.

37:30.552 --> 37:31.358
Right.

37:31.576 --> 37:32.719
All units,

37:32.839 --> 37:35.545
suspect is in custody.
Let's clean up this mess,

37:35.555 --> 37:37.521
get this neighborhood back to normal.

37:39.798 --> 37:40.798
Cuff him.

37:53.443 --> 37:54.598
You all right?

37:55.062 --> 37:57.614
Me? Are you okay?

37:57.958 --> 37:59.518
I did take all the chances, didn't I?

37:59.878 --> 38:01.766
I'm never going to let you forget that.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.643
Your father played Russian Roulette on you?

38:06.678 --> 38:07.939
I didn't know.

38:08.305 --> 38:09.318
Oh, Carl,

38:09.585 --> 38:11.826
you gotta stop believing
everything you hear.

39:26.512 --> 39:30.006
Can you imagine? Your daughters
missing almost one year,

39:30.710 --> 39:32.914
not knowing if they are alive or dead?

39:33.034 --> 39:35.026
You wanted me to see that.

39:36.206 --> 39:38.950
When I asked you to help,

39:39.070 --> 39:41.959
I could not have known we would
actually identify these women.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.862
- You know that.
- Yes.

39:44.238 --> 39:46.718
But you wanted to remind
me that cops do good things.

39:47.678 --> 39:49.432
That won't make me not quit.

39:49.853 --> 39:52.398
I'm not trying to get
you back to your old job.

39:53.038 --> 39:54.638
I understand perfectly why you quit.

39:54.798 --> 39:56.594
- You do?
- Yes.

39:58.118 --> 40:00.351
The hardest moment in every cop's life,

40:00.718 --> 40:03.638
it's when they realize how
scary it is to be the police.

40:03.758 --> 40:04.758
Scary?

40:05.398 --> 40:07.083
You think it's about fear?

40:07.438 --> 40:08.518
Yes, I do.

40:09.818 --> 40:11.798
And what exactly am I afraid of?

40:12.269 --> 40:16.438
A good cop spends almost every
moment of every day afraid.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.958
Afraid of losing their life.

40:24.118 --> 40:26.041
Afraid of taking a life.

40:27.678 --> 40:30.276
Afraid that someone they're responsible for

40:30.313 --> 40:32.554
might be hurt or killed.

40:33.788 --> 40:35.598
Afraid of taking action.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.307
Afraid of not taking action.

40:40.158 --> 40:44.096
What if you arrest someone and
make a mistake on the paperwork?

40:45.660 --> 40:48.413
What if, because of your
not doing the job well,

40:48.533 --> 40:50.554
someone else is victimized?

40:52.904 --> 40:56.598
What if you might not be good enough
to prevent someone from escaping?

40:57.486 --> 40:59.681
Afraid that you might fail.

41:01.598 --> 41:03.156
I let you all down.

41:03.398 --> 41:04.398
No.

41:04.565 --> 41:06.101
If not for you,

41:06.458 --> 41:08.351
we would not have Tommy back.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.880
I need a mind like yours on my team.

41:14.318 --> 41:15.358
Excuse me?

41:17.146 --> 41:18.957
Join us, Arabella.

41:19.387 --> 41:21.118
Join the ICC team.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.640
We're all packed.

41:55.134 --> 41:56.963
I'm not surprised.

41:57.958 --> 41:58.998
How's that?

41:59.287 --> 42:01.445
You know how many nights you left and

42:01.455 --> 42:03.430
stuck me with the paperwork?

42:05.251 --> 42:06.838
You're better at it.

42:07.391 --> 42:11.238
Anyway, I'll have to do all that
extradition stuff on the other side.

42:11.278 --> 42:13.427
No, you'll have one of those kids do it.

42:13.647 --> 42:16.098
Yeah. Definitely.

42:20.438 --> 42:21.988
You doing all right?

42:25.546 --> 42:27.256
I was thinking

42:27.549 --> 42:30.503
once the extradition comes through, I could

42:30.769 --> 42:32.758
maybe be his escort.

42:32.878 --> 42:35.141
Bring Genovese over there myself.

42:36.677 --> 42:38.397
I think that'd be great.

42:41.378 --> 42:43.272
But move first, though.

42:44.798 --> 42:45.678
I'm sorry?

42:45.798 --> 42:47.518
Louis says you live in a shit hole.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.478
Oh, that's what Louis says, huh?

42:51.598 --> 42:53.663
And I'm not staying in a shit hole.

42:58.355 --> 43:00.568
No, I don't imagine that you would.

43:14.709 --> 43:16.648
- You know I...
- I know.

43:16.904 --> 43:18.340
Me too.

43:32.681 --> 43:34.278
Be careful out there.

43:34.830 --> 43:36.478
You take care of those kids.

44:22.086 --> 44:23.278
Louis?

44:23.678 --> 44:24.678
Oh.

44:25.534 --> 44:27.758
I know I was supposed to stay here.

44:27.995 --> 44:31.434
I only made a notification, I promise.

44:33.557 --> 44:35.358
Rebecca, what's wrong?

44:41.558 --> 44:43.158
I have to tell you something, Louis.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.158
Something terrible.

44:46.791 --> 44:49.718
You can tell me anything.
It will be all right.

44:51.309 --> 44:53.166
That's just it.

44:54.798 --> 44:56.558
I'm afraid it won't be all right.

44:59.158 --> 45:01.130
There's nothing you could ever say

45:01.423 --> 45:03.518
that would change what I feel for you.

45:07.078 --> 45:08.551
Oh, Louis...
