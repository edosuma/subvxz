00:13.445 --> 00:15.365
<i>Hi, I'm Ken Thompson</i>

00:15.445 --> 00:18.485
<i>and I'm not going to beg you</i>
<i>to vote for me this Thursday.</i>

00:19.845 --> 00:23.445
<i>Because this Thursday,</i>
<i>you are going to make a choice.</i>

00:24.685 --> 00:29.125
<i>You're going to choose the candidate</i>
<i>who cares about what you care about -</i>

00:29.205 --> 00:30.925

00:32.605 --> 00:34.885

00:37.605 --> 00:41.965
<i>So, this Thursday, please,</i>
<i>please choose me.</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:45.565
<i>Ken Thompson.</i>

00:56.965 --> 01:00.525
OK, peasants, let's queue up here.
Queue!

01:00.605 --> 01:03.485
Hi, sweetheart, come meet
your Lib Dem candidate.

01:03.565 --> 01:05.565
-Ooh, yeah.
-Hello, nice to meet you.

01:05.645 --> 01:07.525
Who will you be voting for on Thursday?

01:07.605 --> 01:10.685
Oh, I always vote
for the handsomest candidate.

01:10.765 --> 01:13.085
-What about a little kiss?

01:13.165 --> 01:14.805
Ha! Why not?

01:18.805 --> 01:20.405
Jesus Christ!

01:20.485 --> 01:21.565
That's a lovely kiss.

01:21.645 --> 01:23.885
Make sure you remember to vote, now.

01:23.965 --> 01:26.805
Hello, everyone.
Just handshakes, that's it.

01:26.885 --> 01:31.725
Oh, look at Kenny. He's a born politician,
and it's thanks to me.

01:31.805 --> 01:34.005
You're a guardian angel
to that strange family.

01:34.085 --> 01:37.165
Yeah, I am the best thing
that ever happened to them.

01:37.245 --> 01:38.805
Look, it's the news people!

01:40.325 --> 01:42.965
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
-How do you do?

01:43.045 --> 01:45.085
-We're going to mic you up.
-OK.

01:45.165 --> 01:46.685
-You cool?
-Cool as ice.

01:48.245 --> 01:50.765
-So, er... Let's get going.
-OK.

01:50.845 --> 01:54.525
I'm here with the local
Lib Dem candidate, Ken Thompson.

01:54.605 --> 01:56.485
-Howdy.
-Howdy.

01:56.565 --> 01:58.565
-Fat man! Fat man!
-Lucas, don't be silly.

01:58.645 --> 02:02.085
-He's a really fat man!
-So, everyone's talking about

02:02.165 --> 02:04.245
-the radio debate on Thursday.
-Fat man!

02:04.325 --> 02:06.365
The Conservative candidate
has a fearsome reputation.

02:06.445 --> 02:09.445
-Well, bring it on, is what I say.
-Fatty-fatty-fat man!

02:09.525 --> 02:11.125
Lucas, you're being naughty.

02:11.205 --> 02:13.245
So, Ken, one of the subjects

02:13.325 --> 02:16.565
which I know is very close to your heart
is cycle lanes.

02:16.645 --> 02:19.005
At the Liberal Democrats,
we are passionate about cycle lanes.

02:19.085 --> 02:22.765
But we are passionate about
the causes of cycle lanes.

02:22.845 --> 02:25.245
Fat man! Fat man! Fat man!

02:25.325 --> 02:28.685
Mate, I'm so sorry. I'm just trying
to focus here, so could you--

02:28.765 --> 02:30.925
How dare you tell me
how to parent my child?

02:31.005 --> 02:32.805
He's expressing himself,
aren't you, Lucas?

02:32.885 --> 02:35.845
Shut up, Dad. He's a fat man!

02:35.925 --> 02:38.005
-Fat man!

02:38.085 --> 02:40.325
Do you know what?
I think we should leave it.

02:40.405 --> 02:43.445
I'll do this another time when there's not
so much lovely expressing going on.

02:43.525 --> 02:46.525
-All right? Shall we leave it there?
-What's your problem, fatty?

02:46.605 --> 02:48.645
-Well...
-Fat man!

02:48.725 --> 02:50.565
Fat man!

02:50.645 --> 02:52.405
Vote on Thursday.

02:52.485 --> 02:54.685
Just, that was quite difficult for me.

03:07.205 --> 03:09.205
That kid was horrible!

03:09.285 --> 03:10.725
-He was, wasn't he?
-Ugh!

03:10.805 --> 03:12.285
Gobby little wanker.

03:14.005 --> 03:18.245
"Wanker."
Oh, God, I love English slang.

03:18.325 --> 03:20.805
"Gobby little wanker."
Say another one!

03:20.885 --> 03:22.725
Grating little dipshit.

03:23.605 --> 03:24.965
-Right?
-Yeah!

03:25.045 --> 03:26.845
Tiny bollockhead.
Have you got that one?

03:26.925 --> 03:29.205
Bollockhead.

03:30.365 --> 03:31.725
Miniature arsehole.

03:33.245 --> 03:34.645
Uppity little bellend.

03:36.285 --> 03:37.805
Mewling wazzock.

03:39.165 --> 03:41.525
No, that was subpar.

03:41.605 --> 03:43.365
-You're just trying too hard.
-OK.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.765
...a<i>nd the FBI suspect</i>
<i>he may have entered the United Kingdom.</i>

03:54.925 --> 03:59.125
OK, so, just to confirm,
couple of points on our marital contract.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.285
When we go out in public,
we cannot hold hands?

04:02.365 --> 04:06.125
-No.
-OK. "Cannot hold hands."

04:06.685 --> 04:08.005
Occasional bottom touching?

04:08.085 --> 04:10.005
-Out of the question.
-Sure. Sure, sure.

04:10.085 --> 04:13.965
"No bottom touching."
Well, I can't wait till we get married.

04:14.725 --> 04:17.765
Um, just want to revisit
the sexual intercourse thing.

04:18.325 --> 04:20.445
I believe we talked about that before.

04:20.525 --> 04:23.245
And the amount we agreed on
was none ever.

04:23.325 --> 04:24.645
Sexting?

04:25.325 --> 04:27.605
If you want to send me erotic SMS,

04:27.685 --> 04:32.005
I'm not opposed to you borrowing my phone
and responding to yourself.

04:32.085 --> 04:33.805
Finally! Compromise!

04:33.885 --> 04:35.405
Thank you.

04:35.485 --> 04:37.965
-"Sexting..."
<i>-Now for the local news in your area.</i>

04:38.045 --> 04:41.245
Hush! Hush! The news.
They might mention Ken.

04:41.325 --> 04:45.365
<i>Lichfield MP candidate Ken Thompson</i>
<i>made a large booboo today</i>

04:45.445 --> 04:48.165
<i>when he failed to remove his microphone</i>
<i>after an interview.</i>

04:48.245 --> 04:51.125
<i>Gobby little w-- </i>!
<i>Grating little </i>!

04:51.205 --> 04:55.365
<i>-Miniature </i>! <i>Uppity little </i>!
- <i>Say another one!</i>

04:55.445 --> 04:57.965
Oh, gosh. My brother needs me.

04:58.045 --> 05:00.485
-<i>One member of the public...</i>
-I haven't finished.

05:00.565 --> 05:03.045
<i>...already describing it</i>
<i>as a complete disgrace.</i>

05:05.445 --> 05:08.325
Oh, you're the ninth journalist
to call this morning.

05:08.405 --> 05:10.805
Well, the way I see it...

05:10.885 --> 05:13.765
-Lorna!
-No comment, no comment.

05:13.845 --> 05:16.925
Ken, you must try not to feel
too bad about this,

05:17.005 --> 05:20.405
but what you did was incredibly stupid and
it probably will lose you the election.

05:20.485 --> 05:23.045
I've still got the radio debate.
I can still turn this round.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.845
What? You think? They're saying some
pretty nasty things about you.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.005
People on Twitter are so inventive.

05:28.085 --> 05:31.485
-That's really great.

05:31.565 --> 05:36.085
<i>-Uppity little bellend.</i>
-I say we double down, stigmatise him.

05:36.165 --> 05:38.525
Make that seven-year-old child
a hated enemy

05:38.605 --> 05:40.525
your people can rally behind!

05:40.605 --> 05:43.645
My instinct says
that will probably backfire, right?

05:43.725 --> 05:45.725
-Yeah.
-Kenny, that's your problem.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.805
-You're too soft!
-OK, so, the radio debate.

05:48.885 --> 05:51.925
This is, basically, your last chance
to turn things round,

05:52.005 --> 05:55.645
Right? So you've got to be brilliant,
as brilliant as Martin Luther King

05:55.725 --> 05:58.725
and 2010 Nick Clegg combined.

05:59.285 --> 06:01.565
-Not sure about that, Nina.
-Not going to happen, is it?

06:01.645 --> 06:04.165
-That's tricky.
- Come on, guys!

06:04.245 --> 06:05.685
Ken can do this.

06:05.765 --> 06:09.285
Ken, how about I get you
a presentation guru?

06:09.365 --> 06:13.405
Someone that can help you speak
and stand, get you out of this mess.

06:13.925 --> 06:17.645
-Yes.
-That's the spirit. Right, people?

06:17.725 --> 06:19.925
-Yeah!
-You <i>can </i>do this.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.725
-No, I can do this.

06:21.805 --> 06:25.125
-That's it, I'll get it.

06:26.085 --> 06:27.925
Sweet little things.

06:32.685 --> 06:34.765
Oh, my God!

06:34.845 --> 06:38.765
-What? Ron!
-Hey, princess.

06:39.405 --> 06:43.485
-What?
-Oh! Are you a sight for sore eyes.

06:43.565 --> 06:46.565
No e-mails, no phone calls.
Where have you been?

06:46.645 --> 06:48.165
Running, baby.

06:48.245 --> 06:50.245
Goa, Sharm El Sheikh, Benidorm.

06:50.325 --> 06:52.805
-All beach resorts.
-Three-star hotels.

06:52.885 --> 06:56.365
-OK, I get it. You suffered, too.
-And with the FBI after me.

06:56.445 --> 06:59.165
What are you doing here?
You know I got us a divorce.

06:59.245 --> 07:00.765
That's a shame.

07:00.845 --> 07:03.565
Because I found you
the perfect house, baby.

07:03.645 --> 07:06.205
Dacha, north of Moscow,

07:06.285 --> 07:09.205
mountain views, five swimming pools.

07:09.285 --> 07:11.925
Oh, It does sound cute, I guess.

07:12.005 --> 07:14.165
Honey, I want you back.

07:15.245 --> 07:17.765
-Come home.
-I can't, Ron.

07:18.925 --> 07:21.565
-I've made a life here.
-What? In this squalor?
-You can't be serious.
-Kenny's family!

07:24.765 --> 07:26.525
And we have fun.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.805
You are Ivy Mittelfart.

07:28.885 --> 07:32.045
Those nails are a mess,
those clothes are six months old

07:32.125 --> 07:34.205
and I think I can see a little grey.

07:34.285 --> 07:36.005
You bastard.

07:36.085 --> 07:39.005
-Oh, Ivy, there you are!
-Oh, who's your friend?

07:39.765 --> 07:43.645
-Oh! This is, um--
-Bernard Bigglesworth Knight.

07:43.725 --> 07:47.245
Yes, Bernard. Um... Yeah.

07:47.325 --> 07:49.685
-Oh, the presentation guru.
-Yes!

07:49.765 --> 07:52.325
Bernard is the presentation guru.

07:53.245 --> 07:55.645
Yes, that's me! Hi!

07:55.725 --> 07:58.005
You only said you were going
to hire him 20 seconds ago.

07:58.085 --> 08:01.525
-I planned ahead.
-Ah, good thinking, Ivy.

08:01.605 --> 08:03.805
Bernard, I mean,
thanks so much for doing this.

08:03.885 --> 08:07.125
I've got to say, I think I recognise you.

08:07.205 --> 08:09.365
Back in the old days,
when I worked with Barack,

08:09.445 --> 08:11.325
that's Barack Obama...

08:11.405 --> 08:15.205
-Ah!
-...I was famous for prepping candidates

08:15.285 --> 08:17.005
for their public appearances.

08:17.085 --> 08:19.285
So, you probably recognise me from that.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.965
Now, I will shout instructions.

08:22.045 --> 08:24.205
Some of them may seem a little strange,

08:24.285 --> 08:26.725
but they're definitely important.

08:26.805 --> 08:31.885
So, Ken, I want you to talk about
something close to your heart.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.805
-Cycle lanes!
-If you like.
-Wonderful!
-OK.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.805
OK.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.445
Cycle lanes, well.

08:43.525 --> 08:46.205
Stop. Go twice as fast.
In Lichfield at the moment,
we only have so many cycle lanes

08:50.485 --> 08:52.645
within the city centre and I think
all we need to concentrate on is...

08:52.725 --> 08:55.765
-Go four times slower.
-Four times?

08:55.845 --> 08:57.325
Four times.

08:57.685 --> 09:00.645
Who... wouldn't

09:00.725 --> 09:03.085
take advantage

09:03.165 --> 09:04.885
of new cycle lanes?

09:04.965 --> 09:08.845
Now shout it,
but only use the word grakal.

09:08.925 --> 09:10.325
-What?
-Grakal.

09:10.405 --> 09:13.445
-Grakal?
-You'll understand it when you do it.

09:13.525 --> 09:16.045
-But I... OK, yep.
-Go on.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.885
Grakal, grakal!

09:19.965 --> 09:23.485
-Now pitch it higher.
- Grakal, higher? Grakal!

09:23.565 --> 09:25.605
Grakal! Grakal, Grakal!

09:25.685 --> 09:27.325
Grakal!

09:27.405 --> 09:32.405
Now I want you to move your head from side
to side, like a bird trying to eat flies.

09:32.485 --> 09:33.845
Grakal.

09:33.925 --> 09:35.845
- That's it.
-Grak!

09:35.925 --> 09:39.405
Grakal, grakal, grakal, grakal.

09:39.485 --> 09:41.925
Oh, bollocks, I've missed
something good, haven't I?

09:42.005 --> 09:43.405
Grakal!

09:43.485 --> 09:46.285
Are you sure you want to stay
with these people?

09:46.365 --> 09:49.485
They're playthings,
they're not worth your time.

09:49.565 --> 09:51.325
They're not playthings.

09:51.405 --> 09:56.405
Ken, dance around and sing
"I'm a plaything" for a while, will you?

09:56.485 --> 09:59.205
<i>♪ I'm a plaything ♪</i>

09:59.885 --> 10:01.365
<i>♪ Plaything ♪</i>

10:01.445 --> 10:04.605
<i>♪ I'm a plaything ♪</i>

10:04.685 --> 10:07.725
<i>♪ I'm a motherfucking plaything ♪</i>

10:07.805 --> 10:11.285
<i>♪ You watch me play, plaything... ♪</i>

10:11.365 --> 10:12.645
Stop!

10:13.245 --> 10:16.165
Ken, wow, that was so confident.

10:16.245 --> 10:19.245
I get it, Bernard. I get it!

10:19.325 --> 10:22.165
This silly stuff is so freeing.

10:22.245 --> 10:25.285
It makes you feel like
everything you've got to say is right.

10:26.125 --> 10:29.645
-You can't put a foot wrong.
-Absolutely, buddy!

10:29.725 --> 10:32.885
-Woo!
-But you did do it wrong.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.205
So, so wrong.

10:35.285 --> 10:37.165
You're bound to tank tomorrow.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.365
Well, smell you later, folks.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.765
Adios.

10:43.845 --> 10:48.205
-Who was that guy? I really liked him.
- Who was that?

10:49.845 --> 10:51.205
Grakal?

10:52.205 --> 10:55.525
He said I was terrible, Lorn. How am I
supposed to perform tomorrow after that?

10:55.605 --> 10:58.085
Bernard Bigglesworth Knight
isn't even on Google.

10:58.165 --> 10:59.605
Don't take it as gospel.

11:00.205 --> 11:02.045
What was Ivy thinking, getting him in?

11:02.125 --> 11:05.565
She wasn't to know, and she's worked
really hard on your campaign.

11:05.645 --> 11:08.645
Hey, would you even be running,
if it wasn't for Ivy?

11:08.725 --> 11:10.125
Why are you defending her?

11:10.205 --> 11:12.445
Well, you do seem happier
with her around.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.285
Yeah. That's fair, actually.

11:15.365 --> 11:18.245
I'm even quite fond of the old bat,
it's just...

11:18.325 --> 11:20.725
Oh, God, tomorrow!

11:20.805 --> 11:23.005
I'm never going to sleep.
Look at me, I'm shaking.

11:23.525 --> 11:24.725
Ow!

11:26.485 --> 11:29.365
Well, you haven't done that for a while.

11:29.445 --> 11:31.925
Well, since you're all worked up.

11:32.005 --> 11:33.565
Lorn, no.

11:34.285 --> 11:36.045
You can't sexy me out of this.

11:36.125 --> 11:39.005
-I'm having a crisis.
-Yeah, you're right, of course.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.685
Yeah...

11:41.765 --> 11:43.885
you get on with your breakdown.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.685
I mean, we could try it your way.

11:55.805 --> 12:00.005
<i>Next, we've got the election</i>
<i>debate live from Lichfield Town Hall.</i>

12:00.085 --> 12:03.365
<i>Will gaffe-prone Ken Thompson</i>
<i>charm the voters into forgetting this?</i>

12:03.445 --> 12:06.605
- <i>Mewling wazzock.</i>
-<i>Keep listening to find out.</i>

12:11.805 --> 12:15.125
-Ken, hello, you look very confident.
-I am confident, Nina.

12:15.205 --> 12:16.445
OK, good, brilliant.

12:16.525 --> 12:18.725
You know, only the Twitter storm
is still raging

12:18.805 --> 12:22.245
and the presentation guru said
you were going to tank, but that's good.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.365
Where's Ivy?
I thought she'd be here to support.

12:24.445 --> 12:26.125
-I don't know.
-Oh.

12:27.645 --> 12:28.885
Best of.

12:31.005 --> 12:33.365
Hi, guys, I'm DJ Johnny.

12:33.925 --> 12:37.565
I'm going to be hosting these hustings,
or husting them, if you like.

12:37.645 --> 12:39.325
-Very good.
-Yeah.

12:39.405 --> 12:42.245
These mics are recording, Ken,
so watch what you say.

12:42.325 --> 12:43.965
He's very good, actually.

12:44.045 --> 12:48.485
So, listen, I'm expecting this debate
to be pretty political, obviously.

12:48.565 --> 12:51.285
Uh, but also it's fun.
You know, I'm a fun guy.

12:51.365 --> 12:54.405
So, I'm going to drop in a few questions
like favourite films,

12:54.485 --> 12:57.485
-what song you like, stuff like that.
-I don't know any songs.

12:57.565 --> 12:59.285
Kirsty, what films do I like?

12:59.365 --> 13:01.845
-You're going down, suckers.
-Live in 20 seconds.

13:01.925 --> 13:03.125
Here goes.

13:05.365 --> 13:06.725
Ken!

13:06.805 --> 13:08.245
Steve, what are you doing here?

13:11.045 --> 13:12.205
Your sister, she's gone.

13:12.285 --> 13:16.045
She left a note. She's leaving the country
with Ron Mittelfart.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.485
-Ron! When did he get here?
-I don't know.

13:19.165 --> 13:24.165
Oh, my God! Bigglesworth Knight!
I knew his methods were unorthodox.

13:24.245 --> 13:25.885
-Come. Come!
-No, I can't. I can't!

13:25.965 --> 13:30.845
Live in five, four, three...

13:36.885 --> 13:38.565
Thank you, thank you.

13:38.645 --> 13:43.445
Welcome to the big debate. We're coming
live from Lichfield Town Hall.

13:43.525 --> 13:45.165
Kicking off proceedings today,
we have a statement

13:45.245 --> 13:47.045
from Ken Thompson
of the Liberal Democrats.

13:47.125 --> 13:50.125
Ken, what are you all about, man?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.845
I, um...

13:56.245 --> 13:57.485
I, um...

14:00.245 --> 14:02.885
-I can't do this.
-What?

14:02.965 --> 14:05.765
Sorry, I'm sorry, I've got to go.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.005
It's a family emergency, I'm sorry!

14:08.085 --> 14:10.405
-No! Where are you going?

14:13.125 --> 14:16.485
Er, Ken Thompson's left,
so let's play some music or something?

14:16.565 --> 14:21.045
-This is a very poor election strategy.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.445
Ken!

14:24.845 --> 14:29.405
Ken, Ken! I was so close,
but her head's been turned by that cad.

14:29.485 --> 14:31.925
No, no, that makes him sound cool.
That bounder.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.805
What are you jabbering on about?
We've got to go! My car!

14:34.885 --> 14:37.125
-Dad!
-Ken, wait! What's going on?

14:37.205 --> 14:40.125
Bernard Bigglesworth Knight
is actually Ron Mittelfart.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.565
-That makes sense.
-Yeah.

14:41.645 --> 14:44.525
-On reflection, the name was outlandish.
-I still liked him.

14:59.965 --> 15:01.285
Right, where are we going?

15:03.005 --> 15:05.085
-Why are you all looking at me?
-Come on, Steve.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.325
You've clearly bugged her phone.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.205
Ken, I would never do
such an invasive thing as... as...

15:09.285 --> 15:11.685
No, wait, you're right.
I did do that, yeah.

15:11.765 --> 15:16.805
-Right.
-Uh, she is on the... M1.

15:17.805 --> 15:21.845
And you, Ken, are... next to me.

15:21.925 --> 15:22.925
Check.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.605
And, Lorna...

15:24.685 --> 15:27.725
you are also next to me.

15:27.805 --> 15:29.125
Check, good.

15:29.205 --> 15:31.045
Right, drive on.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.565
And speed up,
otherwise we'll never make it.

15:33.645 --> 15:36.645
Hello, police,
there's a criminal on the run.

15:37.245 --> 15:39.165
-Ron Mittelfart.
-Mittelfart.

15:39.245 --> 15:41.645
We're trying to catch him up
on the motorway.

15:41.725 --> 15:43.445
How fast? About 80 miles an hour.

15:43.525 --> 15:46.245
-Lorna!
-Ken, the police say slow down.

15:46.325 --> 15:50.405
-We can't, Ken. Put that foot down!
-To hell with it. She's my sister.

15:50.485 --> 15:52.325
What's three points on my licence?

15:56.885 --> 15:59.645
-Well, here we are, baby.

16:01.045 --> 16:02.885
This is Tjaart.

16:02.965 --> 16:05.365
He's going to be flying us to Moscow.

16:06.005 --> 16:09.365
Really? That plane with that guy?

16:09.445 --> 16:14.085
Hey, Tjaart has trafficked more Moldovans
than you've had hot dinners.

16:14.165 --> 16:16.445
Daddy had a plane like that
when I was little.

16:17.365 --> 16:19.005
He took me up a few times.

16:19.485 --> 16:22.165
Hey, I never showed you before.

16:22.245 --> 16:25.445
A welcome-home gift, little Waffle.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.925
Oh, he's just adorable!

16:29.245 --> 16:30.925
I've got you now, baby.

16:31.005 --> 16:34.245
Everything's going to be exactly
the way it was with us before,

16:34.325 --> 16:35.765
only this time Russian.

16:35.845 --> 16:39.005
Me and you, Ron.
Are we really going to do this again?

16:39.085 --> 16:42.405
Honey, I am not going
to take no for an answer.

16:43.365 --> 16:45.285
Firstly, I love you.

16:45.885 --> 16:47.125
No, I do!

16:47.205 --> 16:50.685
And, secondly, I need your retina scan
for our Swiss bank account.

16:50.765 --> 16:53.365
And that's going to be
a son of a bitch to forge.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.285
-Oh, Ron, you haven't changed.
-There's millions in it.

16:56.365 --> 17:00.445
With my new business,
we'll be back where we were in no time.

17:00.525 --> 17:04.685
Me making money,
you at home, all beautiful.

17:04.765 --> 17:07.125
Start the Mittelfart Foundation again.

17:07.205 --> 17:10.485
We'll live forever or die rich, who cares?

17:16.525 --> 17:18.205
-Ivy, wait!
-Ken!

17:19.645 --> 17:21.445
Ron Mittelfart, I presume.

17:21.525 --> 17:22.925
Top of the morning to you.

17:23.005 --> 17:26.405
Sorry about that Bernard stuff,
it was just a little bit of fun.

17:26.485 --> 17:29.085
Stop, let's settle this with
an arm wrestle between me and Ron.

17:29.165 --> 17:32.445
-Shut up, Steve.
-Wait a minute. This is Steve?

17:32.525 --> 17:34.805
-The guy you were going to marry?
-For my visa.

17:34.885 --> 17:38.165
-But we were allowed sexting.
-He looks like a jockey with mumps.

17:38.245 --> 17:40.565
-Mumps?
-Get in the plane, honey.

17:40.645 --> 17:42.365
Ivy, you can't trust him.

17:42.445 --> 17:43.725
He's not a good person.

17:43.805 --> 17:47.565
I know, but I'm not a good person, either.

17:48.685 --> 17:52.165
-Me and Ron belong together.
-No, you belong here with your family.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.525
We're related. So what?

17:54.605 --> 17:58.365
Look, I am a deeply lazy man.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.765
I was coasting and everyone else
was happy with that, except you.

18:01.845 --> 18:04.525
I've loved this MP thing
and it's down to you.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.725
And I've just thrown it away.
Down to you!

18:07.805 --> 18:10.725
And it doesn't matter
because this is what families do.

18:10.805 --> 18:16.365
We help each other out and we hold
each other back massively, so... stay.

18:17.525 --> 18:19.285
-Come on, Ivy.
-Stay, Ivy.

18:19.365 --> 18:22.765
Oh! It's so much harder this way!

18:23.645 --> 18:25.285
Oh!

18:26.885 --> 18:29.165
I'm staying, Ron!

18:29.245 --> 18:30.925
You cannot be serious.

18:31.005 --> 18:34.765
These people are coarse
with strange accents

18:34.845 --> 18:40.445
and they all look ten years older than
they actually are, but they matter to me.

18:41.565 --> 18:43.165
And I matter to them.

18:45.485 --> 18:49.445
Ron, honey, I'm so sorry.

18:49.525 --> 18:51.645
- Do it!
-Oh!

18:51.725 --> 18:53.205
Go, go, go!

18:53.285 --> 18:55.165
- No!
-No, Ivy!

18:55.245 --> 18:56.925
-Go, go!
-No!

18:57.005 --> 18:58.885
-Ken!
-Ivy!

19:00.645 --> 19:02.005
No!
Stop it!

19:07.285 --> 19:08.925
Stop! Come back!

19:11.725 --> 19:13.405
Ken, what you doing?

19:14.405 --> 19:15.645
Stop!

19:15.725 --> 19:17.125
I've done it!

19:17.205 --> 19:20.605
I've got the plane.
You're not going anywhere, sunshine.

19:20.685 --> 19:23.925
-Ken, you can't!
-I've got to, Lorn!

19:24.005 --> 19:27.765
-She's my sister!
-What's he doing? The madman!

19:28.325 --> 19:30.685
Ken, you'll be carried off into the sky!

19:30.765 --> 19:34.325
No. No, I can do it. Don't you see?

19:34.405 --> 19:37.005
This is what I've been eating for!

19:37.085 --> 19:40.445
Ken, you can't hold a plane!
Think about it!

19:42.565 --> 19:44.085
No, wait!

19:51.605 --> 19:53.685
Yeah, actually, no, I fucking can't.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.685
You little bastard!
Turn this plane around.

20:02.765 --> 20:04.725
-Sorry, baby.
-Ugh.

20:04.805 --> 20:07.805
-The lady said turn the plane around.
-What the hell?

20:10.885 --> 20:12.805
I'm Ron Mittelfart!

20:18.205 --> 20:19.725
Oh, you couldn't, baby.

20:19.805 --> 20:22.405
You have no idea what I can do!

20:24.325 --> 20:26.125
Oh, my God!

20:26.685 --> 20:28.205
Can you fly a plane?

20:28.765 --> 20:30.845
Come on, Ivy, what did Daddy teach you?

20:33.045 --> 20:34.085
Whoa!

20:34.645 --> 20:37.765
-I'm Googling it.
-I'm putting it in descent.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.965
How do I land it?

20:42.045 --> 20:44.365
There's a YouTube video. Skip advert.

20:44.445 --> 20:47.605
-Skip advert.
-Come on! We've got six...

20:47.685 --> 20:51.805
Skip advert in five, four, three...

20:51.885 --> 20:53.965
-Too late!

20:58.765 --> 21:00.165
-I found it.
-Yes?

21:00.245 --> 21:03.405
-It's the throttle.
-OK, what's the throttle?

21:03.485 --> 21:05.965
It's that thing there.
The big thing, pull it!

21:06.045 --> 21:08.565
Pull it!
It'll bring our speed down.

21:08.645 --> 21:10.405
OK.

21:10.485 --> 21:14.765
Come on, Ivy Jackson, land this baby.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.805
Ivy, Ivy. You're amazing!

21:19.885 --> 21:21.005
Come on, Ivy.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.125
Oh, look! It's my family.

Now, they're calling you
the Lib Dem's answer to Rambo.

22:52.285 --> 22:54.965
Are they? I guess that's fair.

22:55.045 --> 22:57.645
-Who's Rambo?
-He's a one-man killing machine.

22:58.605 --> 23:00.205
That's not for now.

23:00.285 --> 23:05.325
Now, is it true that you held a plane
on the runway through sheer strength?

23:05.405 --> 23:06.845
Well, more or less, yes.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.725
But, listen, I want to say this.

23:09.405 --> 23:13.125
I wouldn't have be able to do any of this
if it wasn't for my darling sister, Ivy...

23:13.885 --> 23:17.325
my beloved family
and this bloke called Steve.

23:17.405 --> 23:19.645
-Steve Chance, Uber driver--
-No.

23:19.725 --> 23:22.325
-That's beautiful. Thank you.
-Thank you.

23:24.405 --> 23:27.725
Ready for the stage, brother?
The votes are in.

23:29.565 --> 23:30.605
Here we go.

23:56.765 --> 24:00.365
Therefore, I give public notice
that the new Member of Parliament
