What are you gonna do this weekend?

00:39.672 --> 00:42.766
- I don't know. What are you doing?
- It's none of your business.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.867
Did you finish that thing
for your Lit class?

00:44.978 --> 00:48.004
No. It's due in like two weeks
or something.

00:49.816 --> 00:53.274
Oh, sweetJesus in the morning.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.545
Again with these people?

01:01.928 --> 01:03.828
He's burnin' in hell!

01:25.752 --> 01:28.118
<i>Because, if what the framers
of our constitution mean...</i>

01:31.157 --> 01:34.285
What, Travis? Fifteen minutes?

01:34.394 --> 01:36.692
If you prick me, do I not bleed?

01:37.297 --> 01:38.696
Where you been?

01:38.798 --> 01:41.096
I was dropping my grandma off
at the airport...

01:41.201 --> 01:45.160
and on the way back the Five-Pointers
blocked up Lennox Hill.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.796
Oh, so Abin Cooper's after you too now?

01:47.907 --> 01:50.205
Yeah, and I ain't even gay.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.710
Nah, you're not gay. You're just curious.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.837
If anybody would know,
it would beJarod.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.415
What?

01:56.516 --> 01:57.983
All right, all right, all right.

01:58.084 --> 02:02.919
So every once in a while
we add amendments to the Constitution...

02:03.022 --> 02:07.686
to expand, or more importantly, define,
the parameters of our rights.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.261
Like the First Amendment...

02:09.362 --> 02:12.889
which Abin Cooper practiced this morning
on Lennox, making Travis late.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.796
Those people are such assholes.

02:14.901 --> 02:18.393
Okay. I'm gonna let that ride
because this is a passionate issue...

02:18.505 --> 02:20.803
and because, yes, they are assholes.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.939
Wait. Who's Abin Cooper?

02:24.043 --> 02:26.477
He's that creepy church guy...

02:26.579 --> 02:29.309
that's always saying
how God's all pissed off at everybody.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.882
Yeah, him and his family are the ones...

02:30.984 --> 02:33.248
that are always holding up signs
outside of funerals and stuff.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.480
This was they were protesting the funeral...

02:35.588 --> 02:37.715
of the gay kid who
got killed two weeks ago.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.291
Yeah. Jacob Harlow.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.360
He went here.
I didn't teach him, but he went here.

02:41.461 --> 02:42.928
It was all over the news, right?

02:43.029 --> 02:45.088
Jessie, I am both happy and sad...

02:45.198 --> 02:48.258
that you don't know
who Abin Cooper is...

02:48.368 --> 02:50.233
but, I mean, come on.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.928
Abin Cooper
and the Five Points Trinity Church...

02:52.038 --> 02:53.903
they're like right in our own backyard.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.703
Come on, Mrs. Vasquez,
Cooper's Dell is like 30 minutes away.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.743
Yeah. Too close.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.678
Abin Cooper holds
our entire state up for ridicule.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.443
All right?
Ultraconservatives avoid this guy.

03:05.051 --> 03:10.114
Did you know last year the head of the
largest neo-Nazi faction in this country...

03:10.223 --> 03:12.919
issued a statement
distancing his politics...

03:13.026 --> 03:15.961
from Cooper's and Five Points'?

03:16.062 --> 03:19.031
Even the Nazis think this guy
is "nuckin' futs."

03:19.632 --> 03:24.296
All right, let's just hope that the Cooper
clan sticks with the First Amendment...

03:24.404 --> 03:27.931
- Why?
- And stays away from the Second Amendment.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.204
- What is the Second Amendment?
- We get guns.

03:36.783 --> 03:39.411
What is this, man?

03:39.519 --> 03:42.317
It's like Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.913
I thought Craigslist was Craigslist
for people who want to get fucked.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.549
What kinda dirty shit you lookin' at, boy?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.121
Fuck, faggot!

03:53.199 --> 03:54.928
Touch my dick again and see what happens.

03:56.369 --> 03:59.133
- Such an animal.
- They're all the same, man.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.503
- You can't see any faces.
- Oh, shit. You showin' him?

04:01.608 --> 04:03.803
Dude, get your fuckin' flappers
outta here.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.741
Yeah, look, it doesn't matter.
You can see the tits.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.779
You can see the fuckin' pussy, man.
Fuck the faces.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.644
How we know we wanna fuck the face
unless we can see what they look like?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.480
- Right, thank you.
- You fuckin' bag their head, man. All right?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.247
Look, these bitches wanna fuck.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.550
Even if they do wanna fuck,
they're all in New York and LA.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.124
Lots more in LA Look...

04:19.225 --> 04:21.192
New York. LA.

04:21.293 --> 04:22.625
- Road trip.
- LA.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.697
- LA...
- I get the point, all right, but look.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.424
This one's a little closer to home.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.101
Holy shit! Cooper's Dell?

04:31.204 --> 04:32.432
- Let me see.
- No fuckin' way!

04:32.538 --> 04:34.199
We're gettin' laid, boys.

04:34.307 --> 04:36.298
How do we know she's gonna fuck us,
or even one of us?

04:36.409 --> 04:38.502
I've been talking back and forth with one
for two weeks now.

04:38.611 --> 04:40.203
She says she's interested.

04:40.313 --> 04:41.780
Fuckin'...

04:41.881 --> 04:43.781
I just got a little hard.

04:43.883 --> 04:46.443
I don't wanna fuckin' fuck
some chick that he just stuck his dick in.

04:46.552 --> 04:49.146
- Look, look...
- His greasy-assed fuckin' dick.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.722
It's not greasy.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.018
There ain't gonna be no sloppy seconds,
boy, okay?

04:53.126 --> 04:57.187
She wants to fuck
all three of us at the same time.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.661
- Jesus Christ.
- I call the ass.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.496
You're not gettin' the fuckin' ass.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.833
<i>What if this turns out to be one of them
Catch a Predator deals?</i>

05:05.938 --> 05:07.405
Who we preyin' on?

05:07.507 --> 05:10.874
We're the fuckin' minors here.
She's the one who says she's 38.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.174
Jesus. It's gonna be like fucking my mom.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.215
I ain't sure it ain't
your mom, motherfucker.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.342
- Fuck you.
- I don't think I should go, man.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.579
I'm having some doubts over here.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.155
Oh, you're going.

05:23.790 --> 05:26.156
You don't think the three of us
balling this woman in the same room...

05:26.259 --> 05:27.988
is a little faggoty?

05:28.094 --> 05:30.927
Jesus Christ, man.
Don't be so fuckin' middle-class.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.062
I'm gonna take the car out, all right?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.898
No, no, no. Hey, we're gonna be
on TV in a minute. Watch.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.599
<i>This was the scene this morning
outside the funeral ofJacob Harlow...</i>

05:41.708 --> 05:43.835
<i>the 19-year-old whose body
was found last week...</i>

05:43.943 --> 05:47.401
<i>in a Dumpster behind a well-known gay bar

05:47.513 --> 05:49.674

05:52.652 --> 05:54.313

06:05.398 --> 06:07.229
There we are.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.734
- I'm sleeping with a TV star tonight.
- Yeah, you are.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.361
How'd you know
we were gonna be on there?

06:12.472 --> 06:14.963
Barbara called me.
She saw it on the 5:00 news.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.474
So you gonna tell your friends
we're famous?

06:17.577 --> 06:19.875
- Probably not.
- Smart ass.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.640
Where you off to tonight?

06:21.748 --> 06:24.740
I don't know. Just gonna drive around
with Jarod and Billy-Ray.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.819
Probably go see a movie or something.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.944
Fill up the tank before you bring it back.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.047
- Can I get some money for gas?
- No.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.750
Later.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.869
So how are we gonna do this?

06:52.812 --> 06:54.279
How do you mean?

06:54.380 --> 06:56.473
Talkin' about how are you
gonna get under us.

06:56.582 --> 07:00.177
- What are you talking about?
- Me and the lady.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.015
You fuckin'...

07:04.023 --> 07:06.753
This is what happens when fuckin' parents
block porn sites, man.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.690
They make socially backwards kids.

07:08.795 --> 07:11.320
How about you just pull over
and let me out.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.331
Come on, man. You're being...
Oh, fuck!

07:17.937 --> 07:19.564
- You hit it.
- Fuck.

07:19.672 --> 07:21.139
You fuckin' hit it.

07:22.809 --> 07:24.674
Why the fuck are we gettin' out?

07:24.777 --> 07:28.178
It's so fuckin' dark out
no one could see us if they were looking.

07:28.281 --> 07:32.047
Holy shit! Look at your fuckin' car.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.813
Your fuckin' car!

07:34.921 --> 07:37.082
- Are you kidding me?
- Holy shit, man.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.886
Dude, that's, like, a lot of... damage.

07:39.992 --> 07:42.119
That sucks, man.

07:42.228 --> 07:46.255
Who the fuck parks their car
on the side of the road like that?

07:46.365 --> 07:47.832
You think there's somebody in there?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.799
I don't know, man. Nobody's here.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.563
Why the fuck did you stop?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.969
Oh, fuck. You got 'em real good.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.206
- Holy fuck!
- Fuck!

07:56.309 --> 07:58.641
- Fuck!
- Get in the car! Get in the car!

08:04.584 --> 08:06.142
They ain't following us.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.221
Why in the fuck was that guy
on the side of the road?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.756
Who cares, man?
Let's just keep fuckin' going.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.554
- My car's fucked up, man!
- Well, guess what.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.890
Your car's gonna be fucked up
when you get home too.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.520
So why don't we just keep going?

08:18.631 --> 08:20.223
We're in Cooper's Dell already.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.301
We'll hate ourselves tomorrow
if we don't do this.

08:22.401 --> 08:25.837
- I'm not gonna hate myself.
- I'm gonna hate not getting that pussy...

08:25.938 --> 08:28.907
so let's not take this little
fender-bender as a bad omen, boys.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.670
<i>Let's fucking do this!</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:36.780
Lasso me some pussy!

08:44.524 --> 08:46.151
She lives in a trailer?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.490
You live in a trailer, motherfucker.

08:50.763 --> 08:52.890
I was just askin'. Damn.

09:15.154 --> 09:16.621
You Jarod?

09:22.895 --> 09:25.591
This here is Travis, and that's Billy-Ray.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.937
I bet you boys wanna get up
to the devil's business, don't you?

09:39.011 --> 09:42.071
Well, devil's right in here.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.555
You look lovely.

09:57.363 --> 09:58.990
How 'bout a beer, boys?

10:22.555 --> 10:25.956
<i>Hey, Pete. Can you believe it?
I got sideswiped tonight.</i>

10:26.058 --> 10:27.525
- You get 'em?
- No.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.427
I was parked and they kept movin'.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.199
Why were you parked?

10:35.301 --> 10:41.729
Oh, I was makin' a reservation for Helen,
tomorrow night for our 19th.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.968
I'm thinking about taking Darla
someplace special...

10:44.076 --> 10:46.237
for our fifth next month.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.973
Someplace overseas, you know?

10:49.081 --> 10:52.209
Like maybe Italy.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.309
Soon as I win enough off these doggies.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.720
Well, win enough to do this damn body work
on my car, would ya?

11:00.393 --> 11:01.860
Dumb-ass kids.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.996
<i>How you know they was kids?</i>

11:05.097 --> 11:07.725
I don't know.
They was in some kind of Mom-mobile.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.860
Suppose that's mighty keen
detecting skills there, Sheriff.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.700
Yeah, well...

11:13.806 --> 11:17.537
I'm gonna need you
to go out there and find 'em.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.745
You kiddin' me?
I'm off the clock 10 minutes now.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.145
The only reason I'm still here
is 'cause you're so damn late.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.651
Jesus Christ. Just go out
and find the damn car, will ya?

11:27.753 --> 11:30.950
It's a blue Volvo station wagon.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.075
Geez.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.644
This is nice.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.977
You boys finished your beers yet?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.276
- I'm workin' on it.
- Almost. Almost.

12:00.886 --> 12:05.152
Takes me a few beers
to work up to the sex.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.625
So get drinkin',
'cause I ain't drinkin' alone.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.566
And I don't let no man in me
unless he's got at least two beers in him.

12:17.670 --> 12:18.261
Thank you, ma'am.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.837
Makes sense.

12:28.214 --> 12:29.681
This is nice.

12:30.850 --> 12:32.477
Will you close your fuckin' legs?

12:36.288 --> 12:37.755
It's like a shag.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.027
So how's about you head back
into the bedroom...

12:42.128 --> 12:46.087
start strippin' down
so we can get this thing started.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.901
Yes, ma'am.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.665
Almost don't even fit in here.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.775
Get them beers drunk.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.111
This bitch wants my dick, don't she?

13:07.219 --> 13:09.278
She is a lot better looking.

13:11.924 --> 13:13.824
Them tits ain't nothin'
to write home about.

13:13.926 --> 13:14.551
Those tits are...

13:16.328 --> 13:17.795
Fuck!

13:20.166 --> 13:21.690
What the fuck?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.870
Fuckin' roofies.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.763
Hello?

14:04.743 --> 14:06.233
Guys?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.836
Is that you, Travis? Billy-Ray?

14:11.483 --> 14:14.418
<i>On a hill far away</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:16.351
All right, guys, come on.
Seriously, let me outta here.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.913
Can you just let me outta here, please?

14:20.025 --> 14:23.392
<i>The emblem of suffering...</i>

14:23.495 --> 14:26.692
Guys, this isn't fuckin' funny, all right?
Will you let me outta here, please!

14:28.300 --> 14:29.767
What the fuck is going on?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.201
Let me the fuck outta here,
please, all right?

14:32.304 --> 14:34.738
This isn't funny anymore.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.468
This isn't fuckin' funny anymore.
This isn't funny anymore, man.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.737
Come on, let me the fuck out!

14:39.845 --> 14:41.540
I swear to God,
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

14:41.647 --> 14:43.046
Let me out!

14:43.148 --> 14:46.413
If you guys don't let me
the fuck outta here, I'm gonna kill you!

14:46.518 --> 14:48.918
<i>I will cherish</i>

14:49.021 --> 14:53.014
<i>The old rugged cross</i>

14:55.494 --> 14:57.052
Will you find somebody to...

14:57.162 --> 14:59.960
Can somebody please let me outta here?
Please?

15:00.065 --> 15:02.124
- Lucas, sit down.
- Fuckin' bitch.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.701
Hey, you fuckin' bitch!

15:03.802 --> 15:05.963
Let me the fuck outta here,
you fuckin' bitch!

15:06.071 --> 15:08.130
<i>The old rugged cross</i>

15:08.240 --> 15:09.707
Fuck!

15:11.010 --> 15:15.913
<i>And exchange it someday</i>

15:16.015 --> 15:20.884
<i>For a crown</i>

15:24.256 --> 15:25.951
Well, how about that?

15:27.126 --> 15:29.219
That was lovely.

15:29.328 --> 15:31.125
Just lovely.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.722
Y'all give that Mormon Tabernacle Choir
a run for their money.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.496
You know what this is?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.498
That's a printout of what we done today.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.701
<i>That's an article that appears
in tomorrow's Post.</i>

15:44.810 --> 15:46.607
You know what that's called?

15:49.481 --> 15:51.472
National coverage.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.710
- Sure was.
- Indeed, it was.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.215
Abigail...

15:56.322 --> 15:58.483
TiVo'd the segment on the 5:00 news.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.692
Y'all can watch it later if you want to...

16:01.794 --> 16:04.194
and see yourselves on the TV.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.866
Yeah, tell you what
we gonna do next week.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.460
We gonna paint the garage.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.539
I know how you love that,
but we gonna paint.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.369
Someone, please!
Come on, please!

16:16.475 --> 16:18.807
I need big, strong volunteers.
How about you?

16:20.245 --> 16:23.146
How about you? You big and strong?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.846
RJ?

16:27.953 --> 16:30.080
Show me how Popeye do.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.591
Popeye!

16:34.693 --> 16:37.321
Yeah, oh, wow! Don't hurt me, Popeye.

16:37.429 --> 16:39.329
Oh, Popeye, don't hurt me.

16:39.431 --> 16:42.400
Will somebody please
let me the fuck outta here!

16:42.501 --> 16:45.993
Caleb, come on, now.
That's a bit much. Now, come on, come on.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.440
No! Fuck! Fuck!

17:02.521 --> 17:04.512
- Welcome, family.
- Good evenin'.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.887
- Good evenin', Granddaddy.
- Good evenin', Grandpa.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.618
Good evening.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.887
But what's so good about it?

17:11.997 --> 17:15.296
Psalms 117, verse 24.

17:15.401 --> 17:19.234
"This is the day which the Lord hath made.

17:19.338 --> 17:22.773
We will rejoice and be glad in it."

17:22.875 --> 17:24.467
Glad in it.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.942
"Oh, woe is me
if I preach not the gospels."

17:27.046 --> 17:29.913
Corinthians 9:16.

17:30.015 --> 17:31.380
Amen, Grandpa.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.313
Oh, well, I think
I'm gonna preach that holy word.

17:36.422 --> 17:37.889
- Preach it, Daddy.
- Yes.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.925
We read in Hebrews 11...

17:41.960 --> 17:45.157
By faith... by faith...

17:45.264 --> 17:50.361
Noah, being warned by God
of things not seen as yet...

17:51.570 --> 17:53.162
prepared an ark...

17:54.406 --> 17:56.601
for the savin' of his house...

17:56.708 --> 17:58.437
by which he condemned all others.

17:58.544 --> 18:01.012
For there was multitudes
upon multitudes of people...

18:01.113 --> 18:03.581
and God drowned them
all except Noah and his flock.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.207
Drowned them all.
All sinners gone to hell.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.785
Praise his name.

18:07.886 --> 18:11.982
I'm good at climbing.
I'm good at climbing.

18:12.091 --> 18:19.259
You talk to some of them maudlin,
touchy-feely preachers out there...

18:19.364 --> 18:21.992
peddlin' their soft faith...

18:22.101 --> 18:23.796
they gonna tell you what you wanna hear.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.368
They ain't gonna tell you
what you need to know.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.873
They can't. Can't tell you the truth.

18:30.976 --> 18:34.309
Why, it might be politically incorrect.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.981
But they'll tell you...

18:37.082 --> 18:39.516
this nation and the world
is goin' to hell.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.451
They won't tell you why.
Can't tell you why.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.085
They'll tell you...

18:45.190 --> 18:47.124
"God loves you.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.923
God loves everybody."

18:53.132 --> 18:56.465
Does a God that drowned the entire world,
exception of Noah and his flock...

18:56.568 --> 18:59.901
sound like a God that loves you?

19:00.005 --> 19:00.972
No.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.633
That sound like a God
that forgives your sins?

19:03.742 --> 19:05.209
- No!
- No, sir.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.141
Your carnal desires?

19:07.913 --> 19:09.380
That's not God's love.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.541
That's a God that abhors the wicked.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.586
He abhors those
that ignore his righteous teaching...

19:16.455 --> 19:18.013
and forsake his covenant...

19:18.123 --> 19:20.887
and scoff at his acts.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.519
God doesn't love you...

19:25.631 --> 19:27.121
unless you fear him.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.633
We talk about a fear we have
of certain snakes.

19:33.272 --> 19:36.366
Well, that'd be a righteous fear.

19:36.475 --> 19:38.568
We talkin' about a fear we have
of takin' a cookie...

19:38.677 --> 19:40.838
Grandma's cookie jar...

19:40.946 --> 19:42.743
'fraid of being caught?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.210
I don't believe so.

19:45.317 --> 19:49.117
Talkin' about the fear of God. I fear God.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.451
You better believe I fear God.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.285
But my fear is born out of respect...

19:55.394 --> 19:57.362
- Oh, fuck.
- Admiration...

19:57.462 --> 19:59.293
devotion...

19:59.398 --> 20:01.195
sacrifice...

20:02.367 --> 20:03.857
adoration...

20:05.637 --> 20:08.936
and knowledge of the scripture...

20:09.041 --> 20:10.565
that I preach.

20:10.676 --> 20:13.474
Give us some knowledge, Daddy.
Give us some knowledge.

20:13.579 --> 20:16.104
But I preach knowledge,
and I preach to this...

20:16.215 --> 20:19.981
and I preach, and I preach...

20:21.653 --> 20:23.450
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord.

20:23.555 --> 20:27.548
I preach like my daddy before me,
and his daddy before him.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.125
My grandaddy built this church
goin' on a hundred years ago.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.994
He used to minister up there...

20:34.099 --> 20:38.229
at the 12th St. Baptist
up there in the city...

20:39.471 --> 20:44.135
till he couldn't stomach
what he called the deviltry anymore.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.111
So he abandoned that modern-day Gomorrah
and settled Cooper's Dell...

20:48.213 --> 20:51.011
June, 1917.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.683
But if he thought people
were depraved back then...

20:57.055 --> 20:59.080
I mean, his head'd nearly burst...

20:59.191 --> 21:01.989
if he saw how wicked
this country's become.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.062
I hate the wickedness of America...

21:05.264 --> 21:07.664
and all the sin-worshippers
who populate it.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.496
"Do I not hate them, O Lord,
that hate thee?"

21:10.602 --> 21:12.160
Says in Psalms 138...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.865
"Am I not grieved by those
that rise up against thee?

21:14.973 --> 21:17.942
I hate them with a perfect hatred.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.035
I count them mine enemies."

21:22.147 --> 21:23.910
Twenty-one, 22.

21:24.016 --> 21:28.316
And who's the greatest enemy
of God, Cheyenne?

21:28.420 --> 21:30.388
- Satan.
- Satan.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.052
- That's right, baby.
- Satan.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.151
Yes, ma'am.

21:37.262 --> 21:40.163
And who's Satan's instrument
on earth, Fiona May?

21:40.265 --> 21:41.630
The homosexuals.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.396
That's right, baby. The homosexuals.

21:48.507 --> 21:52.739
The homosexuals have run amok
in this nation over 30 years now.

21:52.844 --> 21:54.641
Let's see what it's brought us.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.975
Rampant fornication...

21:58.083 --> 21:59.550
adultery...

22:00.152 --> 22:01.517
abortion...

22:01.620 --> 22:03.485
flagrant sexuality...

22:03.588 --> 22:07.115
in every corner of media...
movies, TV, et cetera.

22:07.225 --> 22:09.716
Schools, malls, books...

22:09.828 --> 22:13.855
clothes, toys, music...

22:13.965 --> 22:15.694
Everywhere.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.598
Everywhere!

22:17.703 --> 22:22.163
You can't turn on the TVwithout seeing
some jackass wavin' his privates.

22:23.442 --> 22:27.310
That's because the moral spine
of this country has been weakened...

22:27.412 --> 22:29.744
by permissive attitudes...

22:29.848 --> 22:33.545
and an unabashed tolerance
for homosexuals.

22:33.652 --> 22:35.620
Godlessness.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.047
Godlessness.

22:40.325 --> 22:43.419
The casual acceptance of the gay...

22:43.528 --> 22:45.393
has hastened our demise as a species.

22:45.497 --> 22:49.365
Fact. Why? Because they do not procreate.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.766
They do not procreate.

22:51.870 --> 22:55.966
Now, they solicit. Yeah, boy.

22:56.074 --> 22:57.564
They recruit.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.143
Yeah, boy.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.873
But they do not procreate.

23:01.980 --> 23:04.107
Is there anyone...

23:04.216 --> 23:06.616
anyone... who can look at the news...

23:06.718 --> 23:10.779
and deny these are our end times?

23:10.889 --> 23:14.791
Outside our fence lays a world at waste.

23:15.927 --> 23:19.294
They's famine, such as in Africa...

23:19.398 --> 23:22.367
pestilence, such as the gay Al DS.

23:23.735 --> 23:29.469
Monsoons, typhoons, hurricanes
and the ensuing floods, such as New Orleans...

23:29.574 --> 23:32.099
New Orleans is number one sin city.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.644
Thailand... Thailand!

23:35.347 --> 23:36.974
Thailand...

23:38.083 --> 23:42.315
where pederasts travel
thousands of miles...

23:42.421 --> 23:45.049
spend untold amounts of money...

23:46.224 --> 23:47.691
to sodomize a child.

23:51.229 --> 23:52.628
A baby.

23:56.968 --> 24:01.098
Thousands upon thousands
dead in that tsunami.

24:01.206 --> 24:05.609
I never saw the hand of God
so clearly in all my born days.

24:06.878 --> 24:09.608
And the Lord's bore witness
to this apostasy.

24:10.315 --> 24:13.910
Apostasy... The leaving of faith,
the denying of religion...

24:14.019 --> 24:15.987
denying of morality.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.089
He's done with it.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.725
He's done with it.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.819
The end is nigh.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.898
- The end is nigh.
- Yes, it is.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.960
Cheyenne, bunny rabbit...

24:34.339 --> 24:36.637
do you mind taking
the children out now for the lesson...

24:36.741 --> 24:40.871
'cause it's gonna get grown up in here.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.572
You ready?

24:43.682 --> 24:45.912
Come on, babies. Grandpa loves you.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.507
Come on.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.746
Gimme your hand there. Come on.

24:50.355 --> 24:51.982
Come here. Come on, sweetie.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.456
When you get finished today in school...

24:54.559 --> 24:56.720
I want you to tell me
all about it, will ya?

24:56.828 --> 24:58.625
Will you tell me about it later?

24:59.831 --> 25:02.197
I wish you'd talk to me sometime.

25:15.113 --> 25:16.944
Would y'all like to see
who we have to thank...

25:17.048 --> 25:19.983
for the extinction of the human race?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.510
It.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.520
Y'all know about that Worldwide Web.

25:29.327 --> 25:32.694
Yeah, that's the devil's playground.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.129
We harnessed the devils' technology...

25:35.233 --> 25:38.396
went out like sheep amongst wolves...

25:38.503 --> 25:41.768
into them homosexually oriented
chat rooms...

25:43.575 --> 25:46.703
and we promised them boys
what they wanted to hear.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.237
Just like an insect...

25:50.515 --> 25:54.952
just like moths to a flame,
like flies to horseshit.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.952
Insects. Insects...

25:58.056 --> 26:01.082
that are easily trapped
in that snare of God...

26:01.192 --> 26:03.092
on that there Web.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.789
And we gonna deal with 'em
the way God taught us to deal with 'em...

26:06.898 --> 26:09.799
the way we dealt
with littleJacob Harlow...

26:09.901 --> 26:12.529
who burns in hell as we speak.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.273
Now...

26:18.677 --> 26:22.272
there's a commandment
talks against killin', isn't it?

26:22.380 --> 26:25.372
There's a commandment
speaks against killin'.

26:25.483 --> 26:27.451
God's talking about your fellow man.

26:27.552 --> 26:30.112
He's not talking about this... insect.

26:30.221 --> 26:34.123
I mean, you don't mourn the death
of a germ when it's been cured.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.990
And a homosexual...

26:37.095 --> 26:39.427
won't stop sinnin' of its own volition...

26:39.531 --> 26:44.127
and it's up to the righteous
to curb the spread of its disease.

26:44.235 --> 26:47.329
"If a man also lie with mankind...

26:47.439 --> 26:49.202
as he lies with a woman...

26:49.307 --> 26:51.605
they both have committed an abomination...

26:51.710 --> 26:54.804
and they shall surely be put to death."

26:54.913 --> 26:58.508
- That is the scripture.
- No. No!

26:58.617 --> 27:01.643
That is scripture.

27:04.222 --> 27:06.122
Well, the wrath of God...

27:09.160 --> 27:11.025
is revealed from heaven...

27:13.331 --> 27:15.322
<i>against all ungodliness.</i>

27:15.433 --> 27:17.230
No! Please, help!

27:17.335 --> 27:18.802
Help!

27:22.774 --> 27:26.039
Now tape him up good, boys.
Now you watch that gay saliva.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.840
If it gets on ya, it can turn ya.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.882
Don't get it near his orifices, now.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.386
- Shut up!
- Send the sinner straight to hell.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.356
Come on, baby.
Send the sinner straight to hell.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.755
Shut your mouth!

27:46.564 --> 27:49.192
Send him off wrapped like a package.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.345
Come on, Caleb.

28:12.490 --> 28:14.287
Burn in hell, cocksucker.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.721
No!

28:16.828 --> 28:18.090
Caleb, head hole.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.605
Let us out of here!
We didn't do anything!

28:28.707 --> 28:30.470
Let us the fuck out of here!

28:30.575 --> 28:32.065
Oh, man!

28:32.243 --> 28:34.734
Let us out! Let us out of here, please!

28:35.780 --> 28:37.611
All right. Get that other one.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.047
Oh, fuck.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.311
Oh, God. I ain't gay! Please!

28:41.419 --> 28:43.182
Don't! No! No!

28:43.288 --> 28:45.119
No, look, I ain't even gay!

28:45.223 --> 28:46.918
Please, no! No!

28:47.025 --> 28:49.118
Please! I ain't even gay!

28:49.227 --> 28:51.957
I ain't even gay. I ain't even gay!

28:52.063 --> 28:53.496
Please!

28:53.598 --> 28:55.793
Stop. I ain't even gay! Please!

28:55.900 --> 28:57.458
Let me go! Please!

28:58.570 --> 29:00.970
- Jarod!
- Travis! Billy-Ray!

29:01.072 --> 29:05.668
What the fuck are you doing? God!

29:05.777 --> 29:08.245
- Take it easy, kid.
- I ain't even gay! I ain't even gay!

29:08.346 --> 29:09.904
You might be worse.

29:10.014 --> 29:14.610
Came to these woods to share a woman
with other men in the same bed.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.778
Will somebody please fuckin' help me!

29:16.888 --> 29:22.690
Fornicatin' ways, they caused the destruction
of both Sodom and Gomorrah.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.284
I don't wanna die!

29:24.395 --> 29:26.090
You already did, sinner.

29:26.197 --> 29:28.256
You destroyed your spirit...

29:28.366 --> 29:30.857
in a waste of shame.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.157
Hey, Billy-Ray.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.327
Fuck.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.028
Hey, Billy-Ray.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.538
They gonna do us like they did that guy.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.411
Not if we can get outta here first, man.

30:18.516 --> 30:21.576
- They gonna kill us!
- Listen. Listen to me.

30:21.686 --> 30:24.985
I think a bone snapped out of this dead guy's
skin when they dropped him...

30:25.089 --> 30:27.751
because I feel something stabbing my leg.

30:27.859 --> 30:30.419
What the fuck, man? What the fuck?

30:30.528 --> 30:33.691
I think I can fuckin'
tear through this paper...

30:33.798 --> 30:35.527
if you can just fuckin'
lean back a little bit.

30:35.633 --> 30:37.362
Just work with me here a little bit.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.935
Just tell me what I gotta do.

30:39.037 --> 30:42.200
Lean back a little bit
so I can lean forward. Just work with me.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.070
Oh, no. No.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.870
Really, no. Fuckin' lean into me, man.

30:45.977 --> 30:47.842
Do you wanna fuckin' die?
Do you wanna fuckin' die?

30:47.946 --> 30:50.005
Then fuckin' listen to me
and we'll go home, all right?

30:50.114 --> 30:52.514
Stop being a fuckin' baby
and let's fucking get outta here, man.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.915
Just lean back a little bit.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.509
All right?

30:56.621 --> 31:01.422
Just relax and lean back
just a little bit so I can lean forward.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.222
If I can get the bone on the thing...

31:04.329 --> 31:05.887
Just can't see straight.

31:05.997 --> 31:07.624
Hurry, Trav.

31:09.434 --> 31:11.061
It's only tape, man.

31:11.169 --> 31:14.969
I just want my mom.
I really want my mom.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.446
Oh, you can't do it.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.686
Electronic gate.
It's got one of them magnetic locks on it.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.258
- That's why I couldn't...
- Yeah.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.264
I'm sorry to disturb you, Pastor.

31:41.366 --> 31:42.958
That's all right.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.594
You're a man of the law.
What can I do for you, Officer?

31:46.704 --> 31:48.831
I'm following up on a report
of a traffic accident.

31:48.940 --> 31:52.398
Station wagon sideswiped a car
out on Route 9.

31:52.510 --> 31:55.138
Oh, my Lord. Anybody hurt?

31:55.246 --> 31:58.647
No, sir. There was no one
in the car at the time...

32:01.219 --> 32:03.414
but I see you got a wagon over there
with some damage...

32:03.521 --> 32:05.921
that matches the description.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.991
Fuck!

32:09.093 --> 32:10.583
Oh, fuck. I'm free. I'm free.

32:10.695 --> 32:11.662
I'm free.

32:15.333 --> 32:18.325
- I tell 'em and I tell 'em and I tell 'em.
- Sir?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.700
That's my granddaughters'.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.968
Once in a while they go into town,
you know, get some milk, fetch a paper.

32:24.075 --> 32:27.772
Whatever. I believe they're your culprits.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.370
You know, it's not
politically correct to say...

32:30.481 --> 32:32.642
but women and cars...

32:33.751 --> 32:35.218
Not a good mix.

32:46.497 --> 32:48.727
- Hurry! Hurry, hurry!
- Oh, fuck!

32:50.268 --> 32:51.530
Go.

32:54.272 --> 32:55.796
Go, man! Hurry!

32:56.908 --> 32:59.342
It's too fuckin' tight, Trav.

32:59.444 --> 33:01.173
I can't fuckin' do it. It's too tight.

33:01.279 --> 33:03.247
Billy-Ray! Where are you goin'?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.839
Billy-Ray, don't fuckin' go.
Where the fuck are you goin'?

33:05.950 --> 33:07.417
I can't fuckin' do it!

33:09.988 --> 33:11.148
I'm sorry!

33:11.255 --> 33:13.246
Fuck! Fuck!

33:13.358 --> 33:17.055
If I could, I'd like to keep
them insurance devils out of it.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.527
You know, rates are high as it is...

33:19.630 --> 33:23.031
and I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity around here.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.101
Well, no, I guess not.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.763
So if you can put me in touch
with whoever it is, you know...

33:27.872 --> 33:31.308
that owns the car that they scraped up...

33:31.409 --> 33:33.036
why I can talk to 'em personal.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.977
Maybe get him some financial restitution.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.708
Make up for it, you know.

33:39.317 --> 33:40.784
I mean, if you could.

33:41.986 --> 33:44.955
I mean, there's only cosmetic damage,
you know. Nobody was hurt.

33:53.898 --> 33:56.594
I guess that'd be fine.
I'll just phone it in to y'all in the morning.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.636
I thank you so much for that.
I'm much obliged.

33:59.737 --> 34:01.568
- Hey, you have a good night.
- You too.

34:01.672 --> 34:02.639
Oh, fuck!

34:08.612 --> 34:10.080
Pastor, excuse me.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.206
Sorry. I got one last thing.

34:12.817 --> 34:16.081
I remember you went over to the Vatican
to protest that dead pope's funeral...

34:16.187 --> 34:17.949
a few years back.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.820
And I guess what I'm saying is...

34:23.027 --> 34:24.619
is Italy nice?

34:37.308 --> 34:39.105
Oh, my God.

34:41.879 --> 34:43.676
- Italy?
- Yeah.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.375
I was thinking about taking my wife
someplace exotic for our five-year...

34:46.484 --> 34:49.942
and, well, Italy was at the top of the list.

34:50.054 --> 34:53.023
Well, it's full of Italians.
There is that.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.319
Full of Italians, huh?

34:56.427 --> 34:58.418
Yeah, I suppose that stands to reason.

34:58.529 --> 35:01.089
- All right, you have a good night.
- Thank you.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.494
Oh, fuck.

35:12.410 --> 35:14.002
Let's fuckin' do this!

35:29.760 --> 35:31.227
Motherfucker.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.820
Sheriff, I got shots fired
inside of Five Points. Repeat. I have...

35:33.931 --> 35:35.398
<i>Shots fired.</i>

35:35.500 --> 35:38.333
<i>Repeat, shots fired inside of Five Points.</i>

35:38.436 --> 35:41.496
Wait a minute. In Cooper's church?

35:41.606 --> 35:43.198
Immediate backup requested.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.901
- Repeat, immediate backup requested.
- I got him, Daddy.

35:46.010 --> 35:47.739
Jesus.

35:50.948 --> 35:52.415
Pete!

35:52.517 --> 35:54.508
Was that a gunshot, Pete?

35:54.619 --> 35:56.416
Pete, you still there?

35:57.922 --> 35:59.150
Pete!

35:59.257 --> 36:04.160
<i>Is this that obese queer,
likes to sodomize wetbacks out on Route 9?</i>

36:08.833 --> 36:12.394
Who is this? Where's my deputy?

36:12.503 --> 36:15.233
<i>Yeah, God sees all, Mr. Queer.</i>

36:15.339 --> 36:17.569
<i>God takes pictures too...</i>

36:17.675 --> 36:20.075
<i>unseemly photographs of men on men...</i>

36:20.178 --> 36:23.511
<i>backwards, sweaty,
lust-filled carnal knowledge.</i>

36:23.614 --> 36:26.879
That fun for you, Mr. Queer...

36:26.984 --> 36:30.784
have a man in your mouth not a mile
from my house of worship?

36:30.888 --> 36:35.120
<i>Now, there was some
unpleasantness out here tonight.</i>

36:35.226 --> 36:36.818
<i>You just let us clean it up...</i>

36:36.928 --> 36:40.022
<i>and I won't send
any pictures of you to the missus...</i>

36:40.131 --> 36:41.598
<i>or the Courier...</i>

36:41.699 --> 36:43.894
those images of how you like
to use that mouth.

36:44.001 --> 36:47.698
And I don't means stuffin' it
with Moon Pies and Coca-Cola.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.272
<i>I tell you what.</i>

36:49.373 --> 36:52.137
<i>What about that picture of you
wiping the feces of that wetback...</i>

36:52.243 --> 36:53.972
<i>off of your scrotum and genitalia?</i>

36:54.078 --> 36:55.739
<i>I think the missus would like that one.</i>

36:55.846 --> 36:57.677
She'd put it on the mantel
at Christmastime...

36:57.782 --> 37:00.250
right between them two stockings.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.220
<i>Yeah, you keep your queerhole shut,
Sheriff...</i>

37:06.324 --> 37:08.383
<i>everything gonna be just fine.</i>

37:12.930 --> 37:15.125
What happened in there?

37:15.233 --> 37:17.963
Them kids was cuttin'
themselves loose downstairs.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.061
Caleb went to deal with it.

37:21.172 --> 37:24.573
Shootin' 'em up while I'm out there
with this law dog.

37:24.675 --> 37:27.235
You want me to move his car
on the property?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.547
No.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.116
Take him on across town.

37:33.217 --> 37:36.311
Other side of the tracks,
dump him off there.

37:36.420 --> 37:40.379
Them Feds get rather investigative
when it comes to killin' one of their own.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.364
Hello?

38:22.466 --> 38:23.933
This is Keenan.

38:25.469 --> 38:27.096
I'm sorry. Who now?

38:29.073 --> 38:30.540
Yes, sir.

38:30.641 --> 38:33.405
That case is under
preliminary investigation.

38:37.415 --> 38:42.443
Report was members of the church
were seeking semiautomatic firearms...

38:42.553 --> 38:46.216
mid-2004, before AWB expired.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.122
We have unconfirmed reports
they got a few.

38:53.130 --> 38:57.897
Well, the intelligence suggests
that they were modifying the weapons.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.199
At least that was the testimony
of the guy who sold 'em some shotguns.

39:01.305 --> 39:04.741
He said they made inquiries
about modifications.

39:06.143 --> 39:10.477
No, sir. Undercover infiltration
was unsuccessful.

39:10.581 --> 39:12.048
Can you...

39:13.918 --> 39:15.317
I'm sorry. Sir?

39:16.420 --> 39:18.047
Can I call you back?

39:19.090 --> 39:21.081
Yes, sir. Thank you.
It'll just be a few minutes.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.427
Oh, shit.

39:33.537 --> 39:37.268
If you loved me,
you'd make me some coffee.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.607
Caleb?

39:44.715 --> 39:45.841
Darlin'?

39:48.719 --> 39:51.085
Oh, no!

39:51.188 --> 39:53.452
No, Caleb!

39:55.059 --> 39:57.584
Come on, baby doll. Come on.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.185
Come on. Come on.

39:59.296 --> 40:01.730
I know. I know, baby. I know.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.257
Timothy 4, baby doll.

40:04.368 --> 40:05.835
Timothy 4.

40:07.004 --> 40:09.939
Timothy 4, baby. Timothy 4.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.066
"I am now ready to be offered.

40:13.177 --> 40:17.011
The time for my departure is at hand.

40:17.114 --> 40:19.275
I have fought a good fight.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.817
I have fought a good fight.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.946
I have finished my course.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.785
I have kept the faith."

40:30.561 --> 40:33.029
He's on the lovin' breast ofJesus, baby.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.366
He's gone toJesus.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.502
I know, baby. I know. I know.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.071
Come on.

40:42.173 --> 40:43.800
Let me show you something, sweetie.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.842
Let me show you something. Come on.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.212
I want you to see something with me now.

40:49.313 --> 40:50.439
- Lookee here.
- What?

40:50.548 --> 40:52.140
Lookee here.

40:52.249 --> 40:54.308
Caleb did not die in vain.

40:54.418 --> 40:57.216
He sent them two devils to hell
before they killed him.

40:58.556 --> 41:01.957
Probably saved us all
with his last dyin' breath.

41:09.700 --> 41:14.831
You go rot in hell, you filthy, filthy...

41:14.939 --> 41:16.839
Come on. Come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.772
Come on. We got one upstairs.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.503
Save it for him.

41:20.611 --> 41:24.308
- Save it for him. Am I right?
- Oh, Daddy, you're always right.

41:24.415 --> 41:26.747
<i>There's a land</i>

41:26.851 --> 41:30.480
<i>Beyond the river</i>

41:30.588 --> 41:32.681
<i>That they call</i>

41:32.790 --> 41:36.726
<i>The sweet forever</i>

41:36.827 --> 41:40.957
<i>And you only reach that shore</i>

41:41.065 --> 41:44.865
<i>By fate's decree</i>

41:44.969 --> 41:50.908
<i>By and by we'll cross the portal</i>

41:51.008 --> 41:57.140
<i>Where we'll dwell with thee, immortal</i>

41:57.248 --> 42:01.014
<i>When they ring those golden bells</i>

42:01.118 --> 42:04.053
They're a pretty tight-knit group.

42:04.154 --> 42:08.648
Approximately 20, 25 members...

42:08.759 --> 42:12.092
all related by blood or marriage.

42:12.196 --> 42:17.327
Makes it impossible
to get any coverts inside.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.231
No, sir.

42:19.336 --> 42:23.102
You're thinking of Fred Phelps
and his family up in Kansas.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.767
"God hates fags."

42:25.876 --> 42:29.039
They're irritating,
but they're not gun nuts like the Coopers.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.950
They're suers, not doers.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.679
Last April someone at Five Points...

42:36.787 --> 42:40.917
reported an I ED setup
on church property.

42:41.025 --> 42:44.222
No injuries sustained
and minimal damage done to a tree...

42:44.328 --> 42:46.888
but in an interview
with the local media...

42:46.997 --> 42:51.229
Cooper claimed that if a bomb had gone off
in a synagogue, a black church...

42:51.335 --> 42:53.826
or a homo-friendly Unitarian coven...

42:53.938 --> 42:55.269
there'd have been an uproar.

42:55.873 --> 42:57.363
No suspects, no arrests.

42:57.474 --> 43:00.466
Local law enforcement
chalked it up to townie kids...

43:00.578 --> 43:02.637
having fun at the church's expense.

43:02.746 --> 43:06.773
But it spooked the Coopers into tearing down
all the barns on their property...

43:06.884 --> 43:09.444
turning 'em into barricade fences.

43:09.553 --> 43:12.181
Locals call it "the great wall of bullshit."

43:14.058 --> 43:16.253
Yes, sir, after the one in China.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.389
What made 'em persons of interest...

43:20.497 --> 43:24.831
<i>was an interview Cooper gave
to the Patriot Times right about then.</i>

43:24.935 --> 43:27.369
He said that
"If the law won't protect us...

43:27.471 --> 43:29.735
from the Philistines and sodomites...

43:29.840 --> 43:31.705
we'll protect ourselves."

43:31.809 --> 43:35.438
You couple that comment
with the allegations, and you can see why...

43:36.614 --> 43:39.412
We've had 'em on surveillance off and on.

43:39.516 --> 43:41.108
They're pretty easy to keep track of.

43:41.218 --> 43:43.652
When they're not protesting gay bars
or chasing headlines...

43:43.754 --> 43:45.779
they mostly stick to their compound...

43:45.889 --> 43:47.516
hold their daily services.

43:54.865 --> 43:57.163
I know I'm low man
on the totem pole...

43:57.267 --> 43:59.792
but are you sure that's wise
at this juncture, sir?

44:01.639 --> 44:05.200
Why? Because if you give us
a few more days...

44:05.309 --> 44:08.767
I'm sure we can dig up something
more substantial than the sheriff's...

44:12.883 --> 44:15.408
That's how you wanna play it.

44:15.519 --> 44:18.215
No, sir, I'm not questioning
your call at all, sir.

44:18.322 --> 44:22.281
I'm saying that our history with
situations like this hasn't been exactly...

44:29.700 --> 44:31.395
Yes, sir. It's dawn here now...

44:31.502 --> 44:34.369
but we can be fully mobilized
and on site in an hour.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.473
I understand.

45:11.341 --> 45:12.308
Fuck!

45:17.715 --> 45:20.548
<i>Tempted and tried</i>

45:20.651 --> 45:24.314
<i>We're oft made to wonder</i>

45:24.421 --> 45:28.152
<i>Why it should be</i>

45:28.258 --> 45:31.386
<i>All the day long</i>

45:31.495 --> 45:36.455
<i>While there are others</i>

45:36.567 --> 45:40.094
<i>Living about us</i>

45:40.204 --> 45:43.696
<i>Never molested</i>

45:43.807 --> 45:47.402
<i>Doing wrong</i>

45:48.412 --> 45:51.711
<i>When death has come</i>

45:51.815 --> 45:55.444
<i>And taken our loved one</i>

45:55.552 --> 45:59.249
<i>It makes our hearts</i>

45:59.356 --> 46:03.417
<i>So weary and drear</i>

46:04.328 --> 46:08.594
<i>Then do we wonder</i>

46:08.699 --> 46:12.533
<i>Why others prosper</i>

46:12.636 --> 46:16.970
<i>Living so wicked</i>

46:17.074 --> 46:21.443
<i>Year after year</i>

46:21.545 --> 46:27.711
<i>Farther along we'll know all about it</i>

46:28.619 --> 46:35.923
<i>Farther along we'll understand why</i>

46:36.026 --> 46:40.486
<i>Cheer up, my brother</i>

46:40.597 --> 46:44.055
<i>Live in the sunshine</i>

46:44.168 --> 46:49.629
<i>We'll understand it all by and by</i>

46:49.740 --> 46:51.731
Come, sweetie. Come. Come.

46:52.910 --> 46:56.277
<i>Farther along</i>

46:56.380 --> 47:00.749
<i>We'll know all about it</i>

47:01.585 --> 47:06.955
<i>Farther along
we'll understand why</i>

47:20.904 --> 47:27.207
<i>All by and by</i>

47:47.764 --> 47:48.731
Fuck!

47:53.337 --> 47:55.032
Fast little monkey!

48:14.291 --> 48:17.055
Who fired? Who fired, goddamn it!

48:17.160 --> 48:18.491
Local Agent 3.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.334
Goddamn it!

48:25.435 --> 48:27.630
- What are you...
- Who the fuck are you?

48:27.738 --> 48:29.433
Did he fire at us?

48:29.539 --> 48:31.769
- No, he was armed.
- Did he open fire at us?

48:31.875 --> 48:34.241
- Son of a bitch had a machine gun!
- They got kids in there, asshole!

48:34.344 --> 48:37.108
- Sorry! I'm sorry.
- Kids you just turned into hostages!

48:37.214 --> 48:38.579
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Asshole!

48:38.682 --> 48:42.015
You can't talk to me, you son of a bitch.
I am a King's County elected official!

48:42.119 --> 48:45.213
Sit your ass back in your vehicle!

48:46.823 --> 48:47.790
Now!

49:06.543 --> 49:09.307
How much you think
a cross like that costs?

49:10.747 --> 49:13.215
You mean in dollars or common sense?

49:13.317 --> 49:15.046
Zing!

49:21.224 --> 49:23.818
We get the spike mic set up?

49:23.927 --> 49:27.328
Well, we were about to,
and then Barney Fife happened.

49:28.432 --> 49:30.297
Well...

49:30.400 --> 49:33.801
Let's go old-school.
We get any blueprints or whatnot?

49:36.640 --> 49:39.700
- 1922.
- It's all county had.

49:39.810 --> 49:44.247
They haven't built an addition to the original
structure for the last 50 years. No permits.

49:44.348 --> 49:48.079
They got anything on four legs except horses
we gotta look out for?

49:48.185 --> 49:50.415
Isn't this a stable?

49:50.520 --> 49:52.488
No, that's Home Depot.

49:53.590 --> 49:56.718
It was a stud farm. Belonged
to the last neighbors the Coopers ever had...

49:56.827 --> 49:58.886
before Abin drove 'em off
and bought the land.

49:58.996 --> 50:03.763
That's where they load up with all the lumber
so they can build this elegant fucking fence.

50:03.867 --> 50:08.566
Million-dollar views from three directions
and then, bam! "Casa de Bat Shit."

50:08.672 --> 50:11.835
Do you know how you get
a valley this beautiful all to yourself?

50:11.942 --> 50:15.002
Put a giant fucking cross
on your front lawn.

50:15.112 --> 50:16.739
Give me the horn.

50:22.886 --> 50:26.754
This is Special Agent
Joseph Keenan of the ATF.

50:27.524 --> 50:30.652
We're here to execute
a search warrant on the premises...

50:30.761 --> 50:34.697
on suspicion of violation
of the National Firearms Act.

50:34.798 --> 50:40.236
Put down any weapons, come out with
your hands up, and you will not be harmed.

50:40.337 --> 50:44.364
Repeat: You will not be harmed.

50:53.717 --> 50:57.414
I think it's the use of the word "repeat"
that makes this work every time.

51:17.107 --> 51:18.665
You wanna breach?

51:22.646 --> 51:23.977
No.

51:25.148 --> 51:26.615
Give 'em a minute.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.245
Get a line opened up.

51:33.356 --> 51:35.347
Yeah, that's gonna...

51:37.127 --> 51:39.095
Come on!

51:41.131 --> 51:42.860
Goddamn it!

51:43.467 --> 51:45.662
Get down! Agent, get down!

51:54.878 --> 51:55.845
Right now!

51:58.148 --> 51:59.706
This is Special Agent Keenan, sir.

51:59.816 --> 52:02.944
Cooper's Dell has escalated
into a firefight.

52:03.053 --> 52:05.021
Requesting backup.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.215
Get the fuck outta here. Go grab a rifle.

52:08.391 --> 52:11.383
The local sheriff shot
and killed an armed assailant.

52:11.495 --> 52:14.987
We C-C'd. They opened fire.

52:15.098 --> 52:16.998
They shot Brooks.

52:17.100 --> 52:18.590
The fucking church people!

52:20.570 --> 52:22.367
They're heavy with AK's and TECs.

52:22.472 --> 52:23.962
I need backup now!

52:27.077 --> 52:29.841
You said this was gonna be
a simple in-and-out, sir.

52:34.818 --> 52:36.649
Simple just shit itself.

52:39.189 --> 52:40.554
Media, sir?

52:42.025 --> 52:44.255
The closest TV station's
a hundred miles away.

52:44.361 --> 52:46.056
The local paper prints once a week.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.824
Media's not a factor, sir.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.472
Sir, that sounds like...

52:59.509 --> 53:01.374
With all due respect, sir...

53:01.478 --> 53:04.606
maybe we should get the deputy
assistant director on this call.

53:05.348 --> 53:07.942
Jesus Christ, there's kids in there, sir!

53:08.051 --> 53:10.747
Just give me another 10 minutes.
I can open up a line...

53:13.290 --> 53:17.852
I'm gonna want something in writing
to protect myself and my field office.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.761
No, I'm gonna need something more
substantial than your word for this.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.998
Either I get a text,
or an e-mail, or something official...

53:30.106 --> 53:32.370
I can stand behind or it's no-go.

53:44.020 --> 53:46.147
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground now!

53:48.191 --> 53:50.591
Down! Who else
is coming out that door, huh?

53:50.694 --> 53:52.594
- It's just me.
- Bullshit!

53:52.696 --> 53:54.823
There's kids in there
and I wanna get 'em out.

54:04.941 --> 54:08.638
Is that Group 2?
Are they sending us more agents?

54:08.745 --> 54:11.043
The situation's been reclassified.

54:11.748 --> 54:14.774
We're to take down
this domestic terrorist cell.

54:14.884 --> 54:17.250
<i>- We fired on them first, Joe.
- We didn't.</i>

54:17.354 --> 54:19.345
That fat fucking asshole local.

54:20.323 --> 54:21.790
What are the orders?

54:24.127 --> 54:27.153
Hold on a second. We don't even know
what the goddamn situation is in there.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.563
Our intel is limited. We've had
no fucking communication with them!

54:30.667 --> 54:32.828
"Our investigation
of the Five Point Church...

54:32.936 --> 54:35.837
at Cooper's Dell
has uncovered an extremely hostile...

54:35.939 --> 54:38.669
domestic terrorist cell, heavily armed...

54:38.775 --> 54:41.710
with intentions of bombing
a local shopping mall this morning."

54:41.811 --> 54:43.278
You're fucking kidding me!

54:43.380 --> 54:45.541
"When we came with arrest warrants,
they opened fire on us...

54:45.649 --> 54:47.844
killing the assistant
special agent in charge...

54:47.951 --> 54:51.717
leaving us no choice but to take
the premises with deadly force."

54:53.056 --> 54:54.819
Jesus Christ.

54:54.924 --> 54:57.950
There are women,
and there are kids inside there, man.

54:58.061 --> 55:01.929
"In the resulting firefight,
all suspects were killed."

55:06.536 --> 55:09.027
Give 'em the gas, then dynamic entry.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.072
Joe, the suits ain't here.

55:12.509 --> 55:15.069
We're here, Joe.
You're here. You can call this.

55:15.178 --> 55:17.476
And then what, Harry?

55:17.580 --> 55:19.810
The FBI takes over,
and we look like assholes...

55:19.916 --> 55:22.043
who can't do our jobs... again.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.019
That's what happens the minute
a single news van rolls up...

55:25.121 --> 55:27.885
and any one of these people
walks out of there alive...

55:27.991 --> 55:30.892
goes on CNN and says we're the bad guys.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.758
Doesn't matter who the fuck's around
to tell it to the goddamn news.

55:33.863 --> 55:37.060
That's exactly what we're gonna be...
the fucking bad guys!

55:37.167 --> 55:39.135
I got 18 years in.

55:39.235 --> 55:41.795
I'm not telling my wife she's gotta
clip coupons till we're dead...

55:41.905 --> 55:44.840
'cause I couldn't follow a simple order,
shitty as that order is.

55:44.941 --> 55:46.909
And we're not talking about Gandhi here.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.205
I got a piece of Brooks's skull
in my fucking knee.

55:49.312 --> 55:51.371
They're shooting at us
with military ordnance.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.642
These ain't a bunch of tweakers
in a motel meth lab.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.445
They are big bad eggs.

55:59.956 --> 56:02.186
Get your men ready for a breach.

56:02.892 --> 56:04.689
<i>Sir, I've apprehended one of the suspects.</i>

56:04.794 --> 56:06.261
<i>Unarmed girl, early 20s.</i>

56:06.363 --> 56:08.854
She's says she's the caretaker
of the kids in the house.

56:08.965 --> 56:12.867
She says she wants to get the kids
out the back without her people knowing.

56:12.969 --> 56:14.436
I think she's legit, sir.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.402
Requesting instructions. Over.

56:21.511 --> 56:24.071
This is a hostile domestic terrorist cell.

56:24.180 --> 56:25.738
<i>Use of deadly force is permitted.</i>

56:27.550 --> 56:29.916
- She's not even armed. Over.
- We're not terrorists.

56:30.019 --> 56:32.351
Those are your goddamn orders.

56:33.723 --> 56:35.850
It's the wrong move, Joe.

56:39.362 --> 56:42.559
We're not terrorists.
We're not. You can't do this. Please.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.936
- No! We're not terrorists!
- Stay back! Stay back!

56:53.042 --> 56:56.102
Please, don't! Please! Oh, God.

57:02.018 --> 57:04.077
You need to take this gun
and go back to the house, ma'am.

57:04.187 --> 57:06.018
- Run back to the house.
- I don't want it.

57:06.122 --> 57:07.749
Take the gun and head back
into the house!

57:07.857 --> 57:08.881
No! You're gonna shoot me!

57:08.992 --> 57:11.153
Take the fucking gun, bitch,
and go to the house!

57:11.261 --> 57:13.161
No! Oh, God!

57:15.565 --> 57:17.396
Get in there!

57:21.271 --> 57:23.000
Your daddy's dead.

57:23.606 --> 57:25.699
This is how you respect his memory?

57:26.709 --> 57:28.870
By trying to run out on your family?

57:28.978 --> 57:32.175
No. Mama, they think we're terrorists.
They're gonna kill us all.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.977
Good.

57:34.083 --> 57:36.847
Then I'll be in heaven with Caleb.

57:36.953 --> 57:39.148
Isn't that what you want?

57:39.255 --> 57:41.120
To be with your daddy and Jesus?

57:41.224 --> 57:44.352
But, Mama, what about
Melanie and the babies?

57:44.461 --> 57:46.793
Me and the babies, Mama.

57:46.896 --> 57:50.798
"How sharper than a serpent's tooth
to have a thankless child"!

57:50.900 --> 57:56.202
You get down on your knees
and pray for God's forgiveness!

57:58.208 --> 58:00.176
When you get done with that...

58:00.276 --> 58:03.336
you take this,
come join your family up front.

58:04.681 --> 58:06.672
Come on, come on.

58:15.258 --> 58:18.318
- Like a good Christian.
- Yeah.

58:30.773 --> 58:33.207
They're trying to kill
the children, Daddy.

58:33.309 --> 58:35.436
They're trying to kill us all, baby.

58:38.248 --> 58:40.273
I don't wanna live in this world no more.

58:41.951 --> 58:43.748
I wanna go toJesus.

58:47.323 --> 58:49.257
Well, baby...

58:49.359 --> 58:50.826
if you die...

58:52.262 --> 58:56.756
fighting an army
of sodomite-protecting idolaters...

58:56.866 --> 59:00.700
I suspect the good Lord's
gonna give you a mansion in his kingdom.

59:02.805 --> 59:05.933
You always know what to say
to make me feel better, Daddy.

59:09.078 --> 59:12.570
"Now learn ye the parable of a fig tree."

59:13.316 --> 59:14.783
Yes.

59:14.884 --> 59:17.352
Such as Matthew 24.

59:17.453 --> 59:19.785
"When his branch is yet tender...

59:19.889 --> 59:21.288
and putteth forth leaves...

59:22.559 --> 59:24.288
know that summer is nigh."

59:25.828 --> 59:26.795
Well, baby...

59:28.665 --> 59:31.896
Iooks like summer's about as nigh
as it ever gonna get.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:06.632
Let's go.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.966
I shall see the face of the Lord...

01:00:09.072 --> 01:00:10.539
and the Lord's glory shall surely...

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.883
You're gonna be quiet, okay?

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.649
I don't wanna shoot you, but I will.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.354
Okay?

01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:34.520
Okay.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.197
Are Travis and Billy-Ray dead?

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.982
So what? You gonna fucking kill me?

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.717
If you help me, I won't.

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:05.055
Else I will, I swear.

01:01:13.636 --> 01:01:15.968
There's government agents outside...

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:18.438
and they wanna come in here
and kill my family.

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.168
- Fucking good!
- Will you shut up?

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.369
I'm trying to save your life.

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:28.708
Those government people...
they're gonna kill you too.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:31.651
They already shot your friend...

01:01:31.754 --> 01:01:34.222
and they are gonna kill everyone
in this house...

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.723
'cause they screwed up
what they came here to do.

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:40.785
They're gonna kill us
so that we can't tell on 'em.

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:44.089
They don't want any witnesses...

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.967
so they're gonna bust in here
and shoot all of us...

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:52.803
even my little brothers
and my sister and my cousins.

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:56.403
But I can't let the babies get killed.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.605
I've done some bad things.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:02.014
But if I let them babies get killed...

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.783
They don't know what
we've been up to in here.

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:14.192
If they did, they could just arrest us.

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.162
They could put us on trial...

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:20.497
and then the Zionist media
would make heroes out of'em.

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.071
But they are gonna need witnesses...

01:02:24.707 --> 01:02:26.436
and that's you.

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:29.437
That's you.

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:34.805
So, if you and me...

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:38.683
we can get out there
without gettin' killed...

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:41.780
we can tell 'em
what's really goin' on in the chapel.

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:45.088
We do that, and they can't
kill the babies.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.139
Sara, baby.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.436
Gimme some sweet tea, will you?

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:20.886
- You want me to save your life?
- No, no.

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:24.966
You want me to save your life?

01:03:28.538 --> 01:03:30.403
You killed my fucking friends.

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:34.169
It's not me I care about
so much as I care about the kids.

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:39.875
My cousin's kid ain't
but three years old and my little sis...

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:46.145
My little sister's only eight.

01:03:56.065 --> 01:03:57.396
Fuck you.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.867
You think they're gonna believe
that you weren't one of us?

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.997
They won't even give you the chance
to tell 'em before they put one in your head.

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:10.602
'Cause once they get inside here
that is exactly what they're gonna do.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.073
You think I give a shit?

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.178
Fuck you...

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:22.052
and your stupid family.

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:25.321
My two best friends are fucking dead.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:28.192
So you know what?
Why don't you just go on and kill me too?

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:31.698
You can take that gun
and just fucking kill me too.

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.462
Just put a bullet in my fucking head...

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:37.130
because that's what I've been waiting for
since you tied me to a fucking cross!

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.335
Cheyenne!

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.144
Please.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.381
Yeah, I bet Billy-Ray said please too.

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.141
And they still killed him.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.884
So fuck you.

01:04:52.989 --> 01:04:55.116
And if you wanna save
your precious fucking babies...

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.749
why don't you suck a fucking rescue
outta my dick, bitch?

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:00.995
What?

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:03.122
You get away from her, you heathen!

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:05.894
- Get the fuck off me!
- You!

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:08.436
Mama, please! Mama, stop it!

01:05:08.537 --> 01:05:11.563
- Mama, please! Mama!
- Get off!

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:16.606
- You damn heathen!
- Get the fuck off me!

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.475
What are you trying to do to her?

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.448
Trying to get what you came for?
What did you do to my girl?

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.676
Mama!

01:05:24.186 --> 01:05:26.177
What's the matter with you, girl?

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.615
What's got over you?

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:33.092
Will you put that gun down?
His friends killed your daddy.

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:35.459
If we just confess,
they can't kill the babies.

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:01.022
No, don't go anywhere!

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.900
There's men outside
and they aim to kill us.

01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:24.468
So you take everybody
up to the attic, okay?

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:27.845
You barricade the door. Okay?

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:29.542
What'd you do?

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.246
You do it!
You get 'em up there, goddamn it!

01:06:32.355 --> 01:06:35.153
- You do it right now!
- What did you do, Cheyenne?

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:38.420
- Go!
- Mama!

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.995
Mommy! Mommy!

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.224
Is Mama dead?

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:50.805
Listen.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:57.640
You go on with Maggie
and the other kids upstairs now, okay?

01:06:57.747 --> 01:07:01.945
You go up to the attic
and you stay there until I come get you.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:06.886
You don't open that door for nobody else
but me, okay? You understand?

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:09.283
Okay, you go on now.

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.859
Quick, like a bunny.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.038
Stevie, go!

01:07:30.646 --> 01:07:32.204
Go, go, go!

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.122
Cocksuckers!

01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:11.781
Mordechai!

01:08:11.887 --> 01:08:15.152
Top of the crown! Top of the crown!

01:08:27.303 --> 01:08:29.032
The Lord is our shepherd.

01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:31.962
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:03.737
Team, get ready to flank!

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.091
No!

01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:05.199
- Freeze! Drop your weapon!
- Look, don't shoot. I'm a hostage, okay?

01:10:05.301 --> 01:10:08.532
- We need to talk to who's in charge.
- Drop the fucking gun!

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.605
You don't have to do this.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:11.968
Get back.

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.599
There's enough evidence
to put us all away for life.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.143
- Don't move!
- Get back, all right?

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:18.736
There's babies in the attic!

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.018
No!

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.156
You all right?

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.096
What the fuck was that?

01:11:04.727 --> 01:11:07.355
Yes, sir!

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:11.194
Yes, sir! He's calling us home!

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.824
Come on, come on!

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:16.427
Come on, children! Come on!

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:23.503
<i>Everywhere, everywhere</i>

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:26.670
Drop the artillery!

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:53.036
There be no need for that anymore.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.235
Where's that sound coming from?

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:57.642
"And the four angels were loosed...

01:11:57.746 --> 01:12:01.773
which were prepared
for an hour and a day...

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:04.375
and a month and a year...

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.852
to slay a third of men."

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.052
Hear ye!

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.095
His sacred call to arms!

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:17.688
The heavenly trumpets sound his name!

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.428
The one true God comes to rapture!

01:12:20.536 --> 01:12:23.096
His faithful slay the wicked...

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:27.539
and send this evil world straight to hell!

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:32.239
Enough! Enough, goddamn it! Enough!

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.612
Wait a minute!
Just wait a minute, everybody.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.913
No more fire and brimstone, preacher!

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.185
What does that sound mean?

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.021
Well, boy...

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:50.728
there ain't nothing left
but fire and brimstone.

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:52.800
Can't you hear?

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.892
Can't you hear?

01:12:57.172 --> 01:13:00.232
This is the Lord's day of judgment.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.671
Four trumpet blasts.

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.804
The seals have been opened...

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:08.576
and the horsemen dispatched.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.652
Three more blasts...

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:16.214
and he closes the book
on this wicked, wicked world!

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:19.590
- Praise His name!
- Praise His name!

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.219
So come on!

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:24.131
Come on, G-man.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.932
"G" for "Godless."

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.094
"G" for "government."

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.899
Come on.

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.906
Come on. Shoot me.

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.442
Shoot me, you bootlicking...

01:13:35.544 --> 01:13:39.173
flag-worshipping heathen!

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:43.342
Shoot me!
It only hastens my reward in eternity.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:47.786
Shoot me! Shoot me!

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:58.155
<i>And then what happened?</i>

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.360
<i>Special Agent Keenan?</i>

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.361
Special Agent Keenan?

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:04.939
What happened?

01:14:07.309 --> 01:14:09.743
I subdued the suspect...

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.437
with a head butt.

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:15.710
- A head butt?
- Yes, sir. The suspect was standing...

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:18.845
unnaturally close.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:24.058
And then the trumpet blast sounded
three more times, and a fourth and a fifth.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.593
By then it was pretty clear
the rapture wasn't going to happen.

01:14:26.695 --> 01:14:30.825
So we rounded up
the remaining Five Pointers.

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.560
On the record, Agent Keenan...

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:35.068
this inquiry commends you
for peaceably containing...

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:37.001
a potentially explosive situation.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:39.573
But, off the record...

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.473
you disobeyed a direct order
from a superior, Joe.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.640
I did.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:49.979
And I have no excuse
that's gonna mean anything here.

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.551
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:12.834
Well, it is the finding of this inquiry...

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:15.000
that Special Agent
Joseph Keenan be relieved...

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.578
as head of Field Office 263.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.341
He's to be placed
on one-week leave without pay...

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.246
after which time he'll report
to the Washington office...

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.751
for reassignment in the District.

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:28.422
I'm getting promoted?

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:34.653
You're still gonna kill him.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:37.163
The United States government
doesn't kill people, Agent Keenan...

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.234
in or out of custody.

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:47.337
Of course we're gonna kill him, Joe.

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:48.909
We're gonna kill him with kindness.

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:52.208
- You're gonna let him go to trial?
- Oh, come on.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.442
- What is this, September 10, 2001?
- Patriot Act, bitch.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.645
We can plant him forever, okay?
Without a trial.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:01.917
Never show him the light of day,
let alone a TV camera or a microphone.

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.048
How...

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:05.388
What do you think
we've been doing the last 10 years?

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:08.486
Yeah. It's terrorism, Joe. Okay?

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:12.328
If you kill an American because
of a religious belief, you are a terrorist...

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:14.732
and terrorists get locked the fuck up.

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:17.930
If it's all so easy
to put these people away for life...

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.837
why was I given those orders?

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.568
Truth?

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.681
- 'Cause fuck people like this.
- They're animals.

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:29.410
I mean, don't get me wrong. Jesus saves.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:33.181
He ain't gonna save Abin Cooper
from a fuck-load of prison rape.

01:16:33.288 --> 01:16:36.257
Daily shtuppings by Coke-can cocks.

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.087
Savor that irony, Joe.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:43.364
Hey, what was it?

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.232
- The trumpet blast.
- Pardon?

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:50.032
The trumpet blast... What was it really?

01:16:50.138 --> 01:16:52.038
Oh, that.

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:53.630
Some new neighbors...

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:57.439
these eco kids from the university
with a compost collective...

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:02.540
they got an acre off the ass end of
the Five Point property, other side of the hill.

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:05.848
Abin's been giving 'em a bunch of guff
because of the smell of the compost.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.946
- Was it bad?
- Gets so you can taste it.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.550
But Abin's been harassing these kids...

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.458
sending some of his bigger boys over...

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:16.463
to bitch at first...

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:18.658
maybe break a window or two.

01:17:18.767 --> 01:17:20.598
Then I guess they went old-school...

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:24.900
Lots of sugar in gas tanks,
burning bags of dog shit.

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:27.635
- College kids.
- No, that was Cooper and his church.

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:30.678
The eco kids never so much
as called the cops.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.337
They...

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.416
They got creative instead.

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:39.317
They thought it'd be funny
to take a page out of Revelations...

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:42.413
and get Cooper and his family's hopes up
with the trumpets.

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:49.220
So they got this big-ass,
rusty old siren...

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:51.925
from a firehouse that just got a new one.

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:56.835
The fire chief said they could have
the damn thing as long as they carted it off.

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.701
It's big as a Mini Cooper.

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.901
So they truck this thing down
to their compost collective...

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.776
they put it in a barn,
they hook it up to an iPod of all things...

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:08.349
and they played these
single-note trumpet blasts...

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.281
that they pulled off the Internet.

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:12.717
And they had no idea
that you were even there.

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:16.757
It was just dumb luck.

01:18:23.732 --> 01:18:27.099
Oh, those eco kids
with the compost collective?

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.895
Turns out it was a cover
for a marijuana grow-house.

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:32.906
They're being booked right now.

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.476
But considering how
they probably saved a bunch more lives...

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.374
Yeah, yeah. I'll write a letter.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.804
Yeah.

01:18:40.782 --> 01:18:42.249
Hey, Joe.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.283
Really...

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:48.322
why did you shine the direct?

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:57.994
My grandma on my mother's side...

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:01.763
she had these two dogs,
pure bloodhounds...

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:05.196
both came up the same litter.

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:10.404
She kept them
and gave the rest away to the neighbors.

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:13.970
Both known each other
since they had shit in their eyes.

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:17.643
Neither one ever treated any better
than the other one.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:20.244
Gentlest dogs you'd ever care to meet.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.153
So anyway...

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:27.626
Thanksgiving of my ninth year,
these two old dogs are trailing me around...

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:32.792
'cause they know the score... I'm a
animal lover who never finishes his supper.

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:35.392
So right before I get up from the table...

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:38.632
I toss these two old-timers
a turkey leg...

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.605
attached to a hunk of cartilage.

01:19:43.245 --> 01:19:45.770
And it was like they'd never met.

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:48.145
They went at each other so ferociously...

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:52.084
all tooth and claw and jugular...

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.815
They forgot anything
they ever had in common...

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:59.383
and scrapped like that discard
decided between their standing and dying.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:10.738
People just do the strangest things
when they believe they're entitled.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:17.600
But they do even stranger things
when they just plain believe.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.843
<i>I see the face ofJesus</i>

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:25.044
<i>On my way tonight</i>

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:34.828
<i>He says to me
Old sinner, come on in</i>

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.991
<i>I see the face ofJesus</i>

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:45.071
<i>In that great white light</i>

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:50.811
<i>And my savior
makes me whole again</i>

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:57.785
In his shining eyes...

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:02.014
In his shining eyes...

01:21:03.225 --> 01:21:05.056
I see the promise...

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:10.198
of all forgiveness that sets you free.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.800
I see the face ofJesus...

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.672
on my way this night.

01:21:22.344 --> 01:21:27.008
<i>And my savior's light to comfort me</i>

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:28.878
Shut the fuck up!
