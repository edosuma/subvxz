we are receiving

11:05.599 --> 11:08.099
is truly remarkable.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.035

They push you down the stairs.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.003
They call you by name.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.272
They make your heart rate go up,

11:14.374 --> 11:18.176
and they suck every bit
of energy out of you.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.111
Y'all want to stay here
for the night?

11:23.050 --> 11:25.450

he was actually beaten to death.

ZAK: This is day two
of our investigation.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.506
Last night, we learned about
an extremely aggressive,

11:48.608 --> 11:51.709
malevolent spirit that haunts
the commander's quarters,

11:51.811 --> 11:55.412
but this is the second part
of our investigation.

11:55.515 --> 11:59.250
Underneath my feet
is a network, catacombs,

11:59.352 --> 12:03.787
a massive underground
that we can be lost inside.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.224
Our investigation will focus
on Battery Mishler,

12:07.326 --> 12:10.327
one of the artillery stations
at Fort Stevens,

12:10.429 --> 12:13.097
which guarded the mouth
of the Columbia River.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.499
Its guns,
one of the few examples

12:15.601 --> 12:17.968
of this type of weaponry
in the world,

12:18.070 --> 12:19.303
can fire in all directions

12:19.405 --> 12:20.471
and retreat back

12:20.573 --> 12:23.040
into the massive underground
tunnel system

12:23.142 --> 12:25.509
to reload
or hide from the enemy.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.745
DAVIS: From the very beginning
of Fort Stevens' history,

12:27.847 --> 12:29.513
there have been
dark happenings.

12:29.615 --> 12:33.217
1868, they found
one of the soldiers dead,

12:33.319 --> 12:35.986
and somebody essentially
beat him to death.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.288
He was --
all these bruises.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.422
Who beat him to death?

12:38.524 --> 12:40.791
See, they don't know.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.226
Even now --
What do you mean,
they don't know?

12:42.328 --> 12:43.794
Well, they
examined his body,

12:43.896 --> 12:46.363
and they determined that
he was actually beaten to death.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.301
-Who could have killed him?
-I don't know.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.003
They seem to have,
like, dropped the idea

12:53.105 --> 12:54.939

12:59.445 --> 13:00.511

13:03.516 --> 13:06.750
August Stallberger's
official cause of murder

13:06.852 --> 13:08.919

13:22.635 --> 13:25.836

another soldier,

13:25.938 --> 13:30.007

13:32.144 --> 13:36.647
something more ancient
is here on these grounds

13:36.749 --> 13:40.417

killed a soldier

13:40.519 --> 13:43.420

to this day?

13:43.522 --> 13:44.655
It makes total sense.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.357
I mean, this would be
a perfect place for it.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.959
I mean, what if?
That's our job, to ask.

13:52.131 --> 13:54.865
Compelled by what we have
already discovered,

13:54.967 --> 13:57.701
I send Aaron and Billy
into the tunnels

13:57.803 --> 14:01.105
to begin investigating
as quickly as possible.

14:01.207 --> 14:05.376
AARON:
Right now, got regular
vision going on,

14:05.478 --> 14:07.244

You never know.

At exactly the same time
they are attempting

14:12.284 --> 14:16.286
to use our advanced equipment
to make contact,

14:16.389 --> 14:18.355
I notice our next
interview subject

14:18.457 --> 14:22.226
reacting to something unseen
in front of her.

14:24.296 --> 14:27.164
There's something weird
going on over here.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.202
Apparently she is kind of
bugging out right now

14:32.304 --> 14:35.673
that there is something
really angry around.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.545
Are you okay?

14:41.647 --> 14:42.513
Yeah.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.982

14:46.952 --> 14:48.452

that you were...

14:48.554 --> 14:52.790
Oh, I got the feeling somebody
is just really angry.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.292
Have you felt that
here before?

14:55.394 --> 14:57.361
Not quite
this emotion today, no.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.563
Who do you think it is?

14:59.665 --> 15:01.999
I think it's a male
that's angry.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.267
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.871
Do you think this guy
is capable of murder?

15:07.973 --> 15:10.708
Possibly, yeah.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.143
That could explain a lot.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.179
I've never felt that before.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.548
While at first I find
this woman's testimony

15:17.650 --> 15:19.249
of sensing a violent spirit

15:19.351 --> 15:22.720
not enough to prove to me
that it is here,

15:22.822 --> 15:26.156
she next reveals
a sighting of it underground.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.492
So you saw this spirit
underground?

15:28.594 --> 15:29.426
Yes, today.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.861
Is it the same
angry spirit?

15:30.963 --> 15:32.229
Yes.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.531
What Jennifer could not
possibly know is that

15:34.633 --> 15:38.936
Aaron and Billy are still
right within those very tunnels.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.672
If something dark and angry
is here

15:41.774 --> 15:45.375
in a place where a man's
brutal murder remains unsolved,

15:45.478 --> 15:48.112
I cannot help but wonder
about their safety.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.013
How did you see him?
What did he look like?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.449
He's dark.
Okay.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.252
Kind of just hanging back
in the shadows

15:55.354 --> 15:57.821
and was just
kind of watching.

15:57.923 --> 15:58.989
I felt something,

15:59.091 --> 16:01.158
and so I stopped
and looked in the room,

16:01.260 --> 16:04.828
and there's a spirit here.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.530
Aaron and Billy have no idea

16:06.632 --> 16:10.000
what Jennifer is telling me
aboveground,

16:10.102 --> 16:14.171
and they are about to experience
an eerie synchronicity

16:14.273 --> 16:16.540
that will soon
be revealed to them.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.644
AARON:
Well, at least we know.

16:20.746 --> 16:21.545
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.746
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.081
Dude, I just saw
someone in here.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.783
-I swear to God.
-What?

16:25.885 --> 16:28.685
I swear to God I just saw
someone standing right here,

16:28.788 --> 16:32.055
like, and was, like,
standing right here.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.557
I walked by and looked,
and there's a guy

16:33.659 --> 16:34.958
standing by the window,
looking,

16:35.060 --> 16:36.160
and I thought...
-Seriously?

16:36.262 --> 16:38.762
I thought it was Zak
or somebody.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.998
Seriously, no joke.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.002
ZAK:
Jennifer all of a sudden
has a feeling that

16:45.104 --> 16:47.171
Aaron and Billy are in danger

16:47.273 --> 16:51.842
at the same exact time
that Aaron sees this figure.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.512
Again, neither she nor I
have any idea

16:55.614 --> 16:57.414
that Aaron
just witnessed this.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.918
I was over by the room
that says magazine,

17:01.020 --> 17:05.222
and I saw
a male figure...

17:05.324 --> 17:06.957
-Wait a minute.
-...a spirit.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.225
-Wait a minute.
-Yeah.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.827
Do you know what room
we were just in?

17:09.929 --> 17:11.662
AARON: No.
Where you said,
"I just saw a figure"?

17:11.764 --> 17:12.663
That was
the magazine room.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.798
-No kidding!
-Are you sure?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.166
AARON:
Well, at least we know.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.306
-Should we go there?
-Let's go.

17:22.408 --> 17:25.843
-Let's go. Come on.
-Let's go. Right over here.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.344
-Yeah, no.
-That's where I saw him,

17:27.446 --> 17:28.979
right here.
-Yeah, in this room.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.914
AARON: Right here.
Yes!

17:31.016 --> 17:34.184
That's where I just
saw him standing.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.619
I saw him
standing right here.

to come find them,

are extremely compelling.

So many questions remain.

An angry spirit,
an unsolved murder --
