01:20.302 --> 01:22.607
Thanks.

01:22.641 --> 01:24.480
- So what's the damage?
- 47.

01:24.514 --> 01:27.388
- 20 a guy?
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:27.423 --> 01:29.361
Forget that. We're not
breaking this down even.

01:29.395 --> 01:32.436
- We all ate the same thing, Drama.
- No, he had the home fries.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.575
- You ordered those.
- Yeah, but you ate 'em.

01:34.609 --> 01:36.447
That's 'cause you didn't like them.

01:36.481 --> 01:38.150
So what? I would
have sent them back.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.324
Are you seriously trying
to sell me your potatoes?

01:40.359 --> 01:41.894
I ain't selling you shit.

01:41.929 --> 01:44.869
Possession is 9/10ths of the law and
your stomach now possesses them.

01:44.903 --> 01:47.510
Whatever. I don't have time for this.
I'll just pay, all right?

01:47.544 --> 01:50.484
- Thanks, E.
- No, I'll pay with my company card.

01:50.519 --> 01:52.155
- Amy, here you go.
- Yes... oh.

01:52.189 --> 01:54.896
- Thanks, Turtle.
- Some company.

01:54.930 --> 01:57.201
Don't be mad 'cause I'm employed
and you probably never will be.

01:57.236 --> 02:00.042
- I gotta call Vince.
- He was still sleeping when I left.

02:00.077 --> 02:02.114
- Really? We'll wake him up then.
- Yeah.

02:02.148 --> 02:04.621
Sorry, Turtle, they
rejected your card.

02:04.655 --> 02:06.693
- What?
- Oh, good God.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.931
- That can't be.
- Thank you.

02:08.966 --> 02:11.338
- Thanks.
- But I never use this card.

02:11.372 --> 02:14.746
- I'll be right back.
- No, seriously, I never use this card.

02:24.805 --> 02:27.109
- Hello?
- Yo, how are you feeling?

02:27.143 --> 02:30.249
Good. Rested.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.887
You should be, you
slept for 18 hours.

02:31.921 --> 02:34.326
Really?
- Yeah, you got the "Ferrari" junket at 11:00.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.664
- Are you gonna be ready?
- Yeah, of course.

02:36.698 --> 02:40.299
- But I need a haircut first.
- I don't think you're gonna have time before,

02:40.334 --> 02:42.567
but I'm sure the hair and
makeup people there can do it.

02:42.601 --> 02:44.435
Naw, I only like
how Sharon does it.

02:44.469 --> 02:46.502
So you'll go after.
I'm sure you look fine.

02:46.536 --> 02:49.437
- Where am I going?
- You're going to drai's at the W Hollywood.

02:49.471 --> 02:53.273
- You need me to meet you there?
- I don't need anything but a haircut.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.209
- All right, I'll see you there.
- I knew you still cared.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.344
- Later.
- Late.

03:04.415 --> 03:06.449
Thank you for coming with me.

03:06.483 --> 03:09.852
My baby wants me to look at a chandelier,
then a chandelier I will look at.

03:09.886 --> 03:13.087
Even if it means driving 90 minutes
into the deep part of the valley.

03:13.121 --> 03:16.156
I know you couldn't care less,
but this is spectacular.

03:16.191 --> 03:19.259
It's Murano glass and it was
originally owned by Sophia Loren.

03:19.293 --> 03:22.228
I'd rather look at nude
photos of her original body.

03:22.263 --> 03:25.664
- Ari.
- I cannot wait to see that chandelier.

03:27.634 --> 03:30.001
- Yeah?
- I've got Jerry Jones calling you back?

03:30.036 --> 03:31.837
Put him through.
Owner of the cowboys.

03:31.871 --> 03:34.139
I know who he is.
- I've been waiting for this call for a while.

03:34.173 --> 03:36.709
- Ari Gold!
- Jerry, how the hell are you?

03:36.743 --> 03:38.910
I'm well. You're a
persistent fella.

03:38.944 --> 03:41.412
I haven't gotten to where
I am by giving up easily.

03:41.447 --> 03:44.982
You know, either you or your staff
have called me 25 times this week.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.017
We wanted to make sure
you got the message.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.652
I got the message.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.687
I understand you want
to sell our tv rights.

03:50.722 --> 03:53.624
Understand that you want us
to sell your tv rights.

03:53.658 --> 03:55.826
- Confident.
- I deliver, Jerry.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.194
Always have. Ask anyone.

03:57.228 --> 03:59.261
Even my wife, who's in the car.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.330
He always delivers, Mr. Jones.

04:02.364 --> 04:04.465
Always nice to hear
from the missus,

04:04.499 --> 04:06.233
but let me tell you
why I'm calling.

04:06.267 --> 04:09.302
A couple of associates and I are
flying out to L. A. this afternoon

04:09.336 --> 04:12.271
and will only be there for the day.
How does 2:00 sound to you?

04:12.306 --> 04:14.239
- We can make that work.
- Great.

04:14.274 --> 04:16.708
Wow me like you wow your wife.

04:16.742 --> 04:18.709
You got it!

04:18.743 --> 04:20.610
Sexy accent.

04:20.644 --> 04:22.645
Jake, clear my schedule

04:22.679 --> 04:24.646
and get as much information
as you can on those guys.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.349
- Will do.
- Whoa whoa, whoa, what are you doing?!

04:27.383 --> 04:29.217
- I'm dropping you off, baby.
- Are you kidding me?

04:29.251 --> 04:32.352
- You heard me say clear my schedule.
- I didn't know that meant me.

04:32.386 --> 04:35.922
- This is the N. F. L., baby.
- And this is a Murano chandelier.

04:35.956 --> 04:38.556
I sell the tv rights and
I will buy you Italy.

04:39.591 --> 04:41.126
What do you mean he sounded weird?

04:41.160 --> 04:43.995
- Not weird, just out of it.
- He's on pain medication.

04:44.029 --> 04:46.063
Naw, he said he didn't take them.

04:46.097 --> 04:48.031
Yes, hello. My card got declined.

04:48.065 --> 04:51.469
I need to speak with someone who can
undecline it because I never use it.

04:51.503 --> 04:53.471
No, please, don't put
me on hold again...

04:53.506 --> 04:55.774
I'm gonna lose it.

04:55.808 --> 04:58.043
- Jesus.
- What?

04:58.077 --> 05:01.444
- Jesus!
- I did it myself. You like?

05:01.479 --> 05:04.514
- I need a second to process.
- I don't.

05:04.548 --> 05:08.284
I love it. In fact, I think we
look more alike now than ever.

05:08.318 --> 05:10.819
- Right?
- What? I thought I needed a change.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.254
This is a pretty big one.
Did you tell Cassavetes?

05:15.390 --> 05:18.192
- Well?
- I'm not an idiot, E.

05:18.226 --> 05:20.161
He said it was fine
and we're wrapped.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.529
- That's good.
- Good? It's great.

05:22.563 --> 05:25.231
Don't be such a nag.
How's it all going with you guys?

05:25.266 --> 05:27.533
Drama's still locked
out of the business.

05:27.568 --> 05:29.368
And his business is
bouncing credit cards.

05:29.402 --> 05:32.037
It was a mistake.
I'm looking into it. Yes, hello!

05:32.072 --> 05:34.106
- Lloyd can't find a script?
- No.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.441
Hey, E, maybe it's time
you start reading some.

05:36.476 --> 05:39.077
- Really?
- Best script-finder in town.

05:39.111 --> 05:41.145
- Would you, E?
- Of course he would.

05:41.180 --> 05:43.548
Yeah, of course.

05:43.582 --> 05:46.551
- Just have Lloyd send them over.
- Done deal.

05:48.654 --> 05:50.387
Hey, Eric.

05:50.422 --> 05:53.256
Jesus, Vince. I thought you were
Samantha Ronson from behind.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.858
I just needed a change. You like?

05:54.892 --> 05:56.825
Mmm. Yeah, you pull it off.

05:56.859 --> 06:00.094
- Thanks.
- So shall we? Maria from "Access" is waiting.

06:00.128 --> 06:02.630
So "Ferrari" opens the on 27th

06:02.664 --> 06:05.132
and there are some pretty
exciting driving sequences.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.768
- Frank Darabont shot the hell out of this movie.
- Were you doing the driving?

06:08.802 --> 06:12.004
- No, unfortunately they brought in the experts.
- Since you bring it up,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.138
that wasn't the case with
the Nick Cassavetes movie.

06:14.173 --> 06:17.508
- I was doing the driving there.
- From what I heard that was pretty intense.

06:17.542 --> 06:20.611
Someone charged $10,000 at Tiffany.

06:20.645 --> 06:22.479
- It wasn't me.
- I know!

06:22.514 --> 06:24.547
- Shh!
- You know who it was?

06:24.582 --> 06:27.283
- My ex-driver.
- The one that wouldn't fuck you?

06:27.318 --> 06:30.586
- Shut up, idiots.
- So Nick just says "you're doing the stunt"

06:30.620 --> 06:33.121
- and you don't think twice?
- Oh no, I thought 100 times.

06:33.155 --> 06:35.756
- But how do you say no to Nick?
- Scary guy?

06:35.790 --> 06:38.792
Have you ever seen him?
6'4", tats on his neck.

06:38.827 --> 06:41.161
Pretty intimidating.
I could tell you a few stories.

06:41.195 --> 06:43.997
- I'm all ears.
- I'll wait for the movie to come out.

06:44.031 --> 06:47.100
Hopefully after the two of you
risked your lives, it'll be a hit.

06:47.134 --> 06:49.634
Who knows? It'll
probably end up sucking.

06:49.669 --> 06:51.803
- What the fuck?
- Jesus Christ!

06:53.139 --> 06:54.839
Vincent, what do you think
the studio is gonna say

06:54.873 --> 06:56.473
when they hear the star is
saying that the movie sucks?

06:56.507 --> 06:58.208
- That's not what I said.
- That's what it sounded like.

06:58.242 --> 07:00.376
But that's not what I meant,
so what's the big deal?

07:00.411 --> 07:03.880
- Nick's gonna be pissed.
- Tell him Vince is dazed and confused from the pain meds.

07:03.914 --> 07:05.815
- I thought he didn't take any.
- I'm making it up.

07:05.849 --> 07:07.550
- I took a couple.
- There you go.

07:07.584 --> 07:10.953
But I wasn't dazed. And I think you guys
are making a big deal out of nothing.

07:10.987 --> 07:13.722
- I was being funny.
- Let me get into fixing this, all right?

07:13.757 --> 07:15.357
Great. Now who's up for lunch?

07:15.391 --> 07:17.592
Not E. He's got scripts to read

07:17.626 --> 07:18.893
- and lots of them.
- I'm on it.

07:18.928 --> 07:20.528
- Turtle?
- Ah, no can do.

07:20.562 --> 07:22.797
Got new drivers to interview
and a thief to deal with.

07:22.831 --> 07:24.165
You really think that
girl Alex did it?

07:24.199 --> 07:26.100
- Uh-huh.
- We'll grab lunch, bro.

07:26.134 --> 07:28.368
Maybe hit a titty
bar to cheer me up.

07:28.403 --> 07:30.803
- Whatever you need, Johnny.
- You're a good brother.

07:30.838 --> 07:33.739
- I'm really glad you didn't die.
- Thanks, Johnny.

07:36.408 --> 07:37.942
Maria.

07:37.977 --> 07:40.945
Maria, can I talk to you about
Vincent's interview for a second?

07:40.979 --> 07:43.214
Fuck off, Shauna. Seriously?

07:45.817 --> 07:48.052
He said the movie sucked?!

07:48.086 --> 07:49.785
I couldn't believe my
fucking ears.

07:49.820 --> 07:51.854
Why didn't you just pull
the plug on the interview?

07:51.888 --> 07:54.722
I tried to get her to cut it, but she
hates me and won't do anything I say.

07:54.756 --> 07:58.225
- How could anyone hate you?
- Look, I screwed her ex, okay?

07:58.259 --> 08:00.060
You have three kids from
three different men.

08:00.095 --> 08:01.361
You've screwed everyone's ex.

08:01.396 --> 08:03.497
This is not something
I can fix, Ari!

08:03.532 --> 08:06.734
It's amazing. I didn't realize that
when I became king of Hollywood

08:06.769 --> 08:09.036
it meant that I would have to
do everyone else's job for them.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.971
Stop breaking my balls
and just call her.

08:11.005 --> 08:12.439
Jake, I need to call...

08:12.473 --> 08:14.941
Ari, you have to talk to
the accounting department.

08:14.975 --> 08:18.511
- I don't have to do anything.
- I have multiple clients with checks missing.

08:18.546 --> 08:21.747
- That's not a king's job.
- Jeffrey tambor wants a conference call with us.

08:21.782 --> 08:24.816
Nor is that. Behead him
and I'll make you queen.

08:26.152 --> 08:28.119
- What?
- I'm not asking you because I need you,

08:28.153 --> 08:31.122
but I'm on the verge of signing
an executive producer from "Glee. "

08:31.156 --> 08:32.823
I don't sing, so what
do you want from me?

08:32.857 --> 08:34.625
- Ari...
- He wants to know from you

08:34.659 --> 08:37.528
that he will be taken care of. And since
you used to do that even for Andrew

08:37.563 --> 08:40.096
before he left us without a head
of our television department...

08:40.131 --> 08:41.397
- What time?
- 1:00.

08:41.431 --> 08:43.332
- Can't do it.
- He can't, he's got the N. F. L.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.234
- You got the meeting?
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.269 --> 08:47.302
- Shit, that's impressive.
- Yeah, I'd blow myself

08:47.337 --> 08:48.802
- if I was more flexible.
- Oh, lovely.

08:48.836 --> 08:51.437
Ari, Mr. Jones called back.
He wants to come in an hour earlier.

08:51.471 --> 08:52.771
- Earlier?
- Yes.

08:52.805 --> 08:55.073
Jesus Christ, I have to
focus up and get ready.

08:55.107 --> 08:58.509
King Ari is actually slightly, for
the first time in his life, frazzled.

08:58.544 --> 09:02.047
So I need you to handle your meeting.
Pretend you actually like men

09:02.081 --> 09:04.348
and don't just chew them
up and spit them out

09:04.383 --> 09:06.450
like the former head
of the tv department.

09:06.484 --> 09:09.486
- Anything else you need?
- The N. F. L.'s a king's ransom, Jake.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.688
What more could I possibly need?

09:13.991 --> 09:15.724
You screwed her ex, Shauna?

09:15.759 --> 09:17.392
Is this one of your kids' fathers?

09:17.427 --> 09:19.962
- When did we become friends, Eric?
- We didn't.

09:19.996 --> 09:22.564
- You want me to call Maria?
- No, Ari's got it covered.

09:22.599 --> 09:25.133
- I will call you after he calls me.
- Thank you.

09:25.168 --> 09:27.102
You're welcome.
Rude little irish prick.

09:27.136 --> 09:28.637
Nasty bitch.

09:28.671 --> 09:32.073
Look who finally has time to
show up at his own office. Huh?

09:32.107 --> 09:34.741
When you represent a movie star, Scott,
we'll see how much time you have.

09:34.776 --> 09:37.609
Oh, excuse me, are you implying that
Chris O'Donnell is not a movie star?

09:37.644 --> 09:39.744
Because I will tell him
and he will kick your ass.

09:39.778 --> 09:42.146
- These came from Johnny.
- Jesus!

09:42.180 --> 09:44.215
Johnny who? You didn't
sign Depp, you fuck?

09:44.249 --> 09:46.917
- No.
- Thank God!

09:46.951 --> 09:48.619
And Murray called from the airport.

09:48.653 --> 09:50.387
He ran to Paris with
that 20-year-old,

09:50.421 --> 09:52.522
wanted to make sure you didn't
need anything before he went.

09:52.557 --> 09:54.825
- Me? What could I possibly need?
- Nothing.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.796
Absolutely nothing.
That is the point, E.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.630
We do not need the old man.

09:59.664 --> 10:03.165
We could be making beautiful music together
if you'd stop pushing me away all the time.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.999
- I will keep that in mind, Scotty, thank you.
- Thank you.

10:06.034 --> 10:08.768
And, doll, the music thing,
that goes for you too.

10:08.803 --> 10:11.571
I think you've got a
better chance with him.

10:11.606 --> 10:13.840
Oh really?

10:13.874 --> 10:16.408
- So do you know L. A. well?
- Oh yeah, like the back of my hand.

10:16.443 --> 10:18.376
I'm an actress so I've
auditioned all over town.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.878
Oh, cool. Anything I
might have seen you in?

10:20.913 --> 10:24.681
Um, well, I fucked David Duchovny
on "Californication. "

10:24.716 --> 10:27.617
Oh, really? I watch that show.
I don't remember you.

10:27.652 --> 10:30.387
Oh, it was from behind so they
never really showed my face.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.657
Oh. Oh yeah, I remember that.

10:34.691 --> 10:36.258
- That was good.
- Thanks.

10:36.293 --> 10:38.393
But I'm giving up on
the whole acting thing

10:38.428 --> 10:40.762
'cause every role I get, they
just want me to show my tits.

10:40.796 --> 10:43.397
- No one's going to ask you to show your tits here.
- Good.

10:44.699 --> 10:47.467
Hey, Rachel said I could
come by and grab my check.

10:47.502 --> 10:49.936
- Uh, yeah. Can you give me one second?
- Mm-hmm.

10:49.971 --> 10:52.805
All right. Let's go out there.

10:54.608 --> 10:57.076
- You know you could have just mailed it.
- Yeah, I could have.

10:57.110 --> 11:00.078
And if you wanted to say you're sorry
again, you could have just called.

11:00.113 --> 11:01.946
- I didn't want to say I'm sorry.
- Oh.

11:01.981 --> 11:04.681
No? - No, I was on the
phone with Amex all morning.

11:04.716 --> 11:07.183
It seems someone charged
$10,000 at Tiffany's?

11:07.218 --> 11:10.552
- $10,000?
- You're the only one I let use that card.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.887
- So what are you saying?
- Did you use it at Tiffany's?

11:12.922 --> 11:14.689
Uh, yeah, I did.

11:14.723 --> 11:16.390
Then I'm saying if you give
me back whatever you bought

11:16.424 --> 11:18.525
and I can return it, I don't
see a reason to call the cops.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.093
- The cops!
- Yeah.

11:20.128 --> 11:22.695
Why don't you give me my
paycheck before I call the cops.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.664
- You're gonna call the cops?
- Yeah, Turtle.

11:24.698 --> 11:27.633
I'm gonna call the cops because I
did use the credit card at Tiffany

11:27.667 --> 11:30.001
when you asked me to do you a favor
and get your mom something nice.

11:30.036 --> 11:32.570
- I did?
- Yeah. And I'm sure that was your way

11:32.604 --> 11:34.839
of trying to turn me on, but the
fact that you didn't even look at it

11:34.873 --> 11:37.707
and don't even remember tells me
everything I need to know about you.

11:37.742 --> 11:39.809
So you bought my mother
something for 10 grand,

11:39.844 --> 11:41.611
yet I didn't receive
a thank you card?

11:41.645 --> 11:44.146
No, I bought your mom
something for $1,000.

11:44.181 --> 11:46.248
It should be there
today or tomorrow.

11:46.282 --> 11:48.049
So why would they
charge my card 10 grand?

11:48.083 --> 11:51.052
Check with Tiffany's because it's got
nothing to do with me, asshole.

11:51.086 --> 11:55.322
Oh, and by the way, he
did try to see my tits!

12:00.861 --> 12:03.629
- Have you checked in with E?
- I have a call into him, Johnny.

12:03.663 --> 12:05.997
But I don't think he's gonna
have any more luck than I had.

12:06.031 --> 12:08.766
Don't be jealous that I
brought a big gun in, Lloyd.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.135
I'm not jealous of
your big gun, Johnny.

12:11.169 --> 12:13.737
It would just be nice if you
appreciated the job I'm doing.

12:13.771 --> 12:16.172
When I have a job, I'll
appreciate your job.

12:16.206 --> 12:18.341
- Goodbye, Johnny.
- Goodbye, Lloyd.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.377
I feel like a leper, bro.
Like nobody cares.

12:21.412 --> 12:24.180
- That's not true. E cares.
- No, he's just being a friend.

12:24.214 --> 12:27.116
Hey, Johnny, do you
want a lap dance?

12:27.150 --> 12:30.285
Yeah, sure, Cind.
How about at my house

12:30.319 --> 12:32.520
in my bed with no
tassels on your tits?

12:32.555 --> 12:35.389
- What do you say?
- You're gross.

12:35.424 --> 12:37.925
See, I'm a leper.

12:37.959 --> 12:41.361
- Come on, Johnny, cheer up.
- Only finding a script will cheer me up.

12:41.395 --> 12:44.031
All right, I have an idea.
Why don't I call E,

12:44.065 --> 12:46.866
- make sure he's working?
- Good thinking.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.637
Yeah, well, I do have other
things to deal with, Vince.

12:49.671 --> 12:52.206
- Like what?
- Like the Maria thing for one.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.408
- Isn't Shauna dealing with that?
- Yeah, it's being handled.

12:55.443 --> 12:58.010
- Good, then you're free.
- You're not my only client.

12:58.045 --> 13:01.213
Yeah, but I'm still your biggest and I'm
saying you don't need to deal with me right now.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.849
So just pretend that Johnny's me
and treat him like you'd treat me.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.617
- Okay.
- Come on, bro, come on.

13:05.651 --> 13:08.719
- Strip club in the middle of the day, Vince?
- Research for a role.

13:08.753 --> 13:12.056
- All right, we'll see you there in a few.
- You guys are coming here?!

13:12.090 --> 13:14.624
Yeah, we'll all pitch in.

13:18.796 --> 13:20.696
Jennie, will you
cancel my Saget lunch?

13:20.730 --> 13:23.164
- He won't be happy.
- Yeah, he never is.

13:23.198 --> 13:26.966
I'll take your Saget lunch. I'm doing all
Murray's work, I might as well do yours too.

13:27.001 --> 13:28.968
You want to help, read a
script for Johnny Chase.

13:29.002 --> 13:31.203
I'd rather have my asshole waxed.

13:43.682 --> 13:45.615
The N. F. L. is here.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.950
- Conference room, quickly.
- Should I get that first?

13:47.985 --> 13:49.819
- What does quickly mean?
- Okay!

13:49.853 --> 13:52.087
- Ari.
- I thought you had a signing.

13:52.121 --> 13:54.088
- I moved it up, he's signed.
- Good work.

13:54.123 --> 13:56.090
- Let me sit in on the N. F. L.
- For what purpose?

13:56.124 --> 13:57.725
- A woman's perspective.
- This is football.

13:57.759 --> 13:59.393
We don't need a
woman's perspective.

13:59.427 --> 14:01.295
Ari, I know more about the N. F. L. than you do.
- Please.

14:01.329 --> 14:02.696
I used to intern at N. F. L. Films.

14:02.730 --> 14:05.266
My cousin used to wash
Phil Mickelson's balls.

14:05.301 --> 14:06.935
Does that mean he's
ready for the masters?

14:06.969 --> 14:08.802
- Ari, I know what I'm talking about.
- Okay, fine.

14:08.837 --> 14:11.503
You are now the commissioner of the N. F. L.
What's your first order of business?

14:11.538 --> 14:14.339
I would eliminate two preseason games.
I'd go to an 18-game schedule.

14:14.373 --> 14:17.075
Teams will sell more tickets, more
concessions, more merchandise...

14:17.109 --> 14:19.143
All right, fine. Only speak
when spoken to and button up.

14:19.177 --> 14:21.445
- Button up?
- This is the N. F. L. Not the N. B. A.

14:24.115 --> 14:26.449
Gentlemen, it is a privilege
and an honor to meet

14:26.484 --> 14:29.084
with the heads of the greatest
sports league on the planet.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.919
- How are you?
- It's good to see you, Lee.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.287
- Jerry, how was the flight?
- Bumpy as hell,

14:33.322 --> 14:35.289
but I hope it's smooth
sailing from here.

14:35.323 --> 14:37.157
No doubt, sir.
Come on in, everybody.

14:37.191 --> 14:38.892
This is my colleague Lizzie Grant.

14:38.926 --> 14:40.793
Hi, it's such a pleasure
to meet you all.

14:40.828 --> 14:44.397
But, Lee Gordon, I hope you won't be
insulted. I'm not sure I can talk to you.

14:44.431 --> 14:47.299
- You two know each other?
- No, no.

14:47.334 --> 14:49.367
But I know that Lee
is with the Steelers

14:49.402 --> 14:51.569
and I'm a Bengals
girl from Cncinnati.

14:51.604 --> 14:53.838
I hope we can still be friends.

14:53.872 --> 14:56.707
If you can give me some insight on
how we can beat them, we will be.

14:56.741 --> 14:58.241
You guys swept us last year.

14:58.276 --> 15:00.743
You won two championships
in the last five years.

15:00.777 --> 15:03.779
You have to let a long-suffering fan
like me have a little fun, right?

15:05.415 --> 15:08.216
Do you have a boyfriend?
You know, I'm grooming my son

15:08.250 --> 15:10.484
to be general manager
of the Cowboys.

15:10.519 --> 15:13.220
Maybe I ought to be grooming
you to be the G. M.

15:14.556 --> 15:17.991
Huh, wow. This kid
spent his whole life

15:18.025 --> 15:21.027
skydiving, bungee
jumping, cliff diving,

15:21.061 --> 15:23.629
then one day gets hit by a car.

15:23.663 --> 15:27.599
- It's a comedy?
- No, I was reading this magazine.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.235
But listen, he decided to become an
organ donor before he was killed.

15:31.269 --> 15:34.437
- Jesus, bro.
- And his organs saved six lives

15:34.472 --> 15:38.107
and enhanced 30 more. Am I an organ donor, E?
- Yes.

15:38.142 --> 15:40.342
Great. You guys want
to go bungee jumping?

15:40.376 --> 15:42.343
No, Vince, we want to
read these scripts.

15:42.378 --> 15:44.145
- We do?
- Yeah.

15:44.179 --> 15:46.848
We almost lost you once this week,
we don't need another scare.

15:46.882 --> 15:49.650
Johnny, this kid died
in a car accident.

15:49.685 --> 15:52.919
I could walk out of here and boom!

15:52.954 --> 15:54.354
Get hit by a bus.

15:54.389 --> 15:56.223
You can't be afraid
to try new things, E.

15:56.257 --> 15:59.126
If it'll get me a break from this,
I'd go swimming with sharks.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.128
You're not swimming
with nobody. Now read.

16:01.162 --> 16:04.365
Baby bro, I know you don't even like
to read your own scripts. You can go.

16:04.399 --> 16:05.933
- Shark swimming?
- Read.

16:05.968 --> 16:08.102
I'm gonna go roam the office.
Check out the company.

16:08.137 --> 16:10.839
- Stay away from Jennie.
- Oh, is she the heavyset one?

16:12.007 --> 16:14.841
I'm focused!

16:15.908 --> 16:17.941
Jennie, want to go to lunch?

16:17.976 --> 16:20.443
- I don't think E's gonna let me.
- How about Florence?

16:20.477 --> 16:25.313
I know he won't let me. But if you're
serious, maybe I'll quit.

16:27.383 --> 16:29.117
Vinnie Chase, hey man.

16:29.151 --> 16:30.951
What's the matter?
E not keeping you engaged?

16:30.985 --> 16:32.786
Oh no, he's working on
stuff for my brother.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.121
Scotty Lavin. I work with your boy.

16:35.155 --> 16:36.889
- I dig the haircut.
- Yeah?

16:36.923 --> 16:38.890
Yeah. Is it for the
Cassavetes movie?

16:38.925 --> 16:40.625
No, I just figured why not?

16:40.660 --> 16:43.260
- I love the spontaneity.
- I love to hear it.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.829
I've been hanging out with a bunch of bores.
Nobody wants to have any fun.

16:45.864 --> 16:47.997
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

16:48.032 --> 16:49.799
Bungee jumping, heli boarding.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.134
- Really?
- I've never done either,

16:52.168 --> 16:53.902
but I'm intrigued.
It's kinda nuts, right?

16:53.936 --> 16:55.670
I don't think so, but I'm an idiot.

16:55.705 --> 16:57.238
I'm jumping off a cliff
for spring break.

16:57.273 --> 16:59.707
- Are you serious? I'd love to try that.
- So come with.

16:59.742 --> 17:02.009
- You got anything sooner?
- Have I got anything sooner?

17:02.043 --> 17:04.243
You're sick. I love you.
You want to jump out of a plane?

17:04.278 --> 17:06.479
I know a guy. I could have
you in the air in 20 minutes.

17:06.512 --> 17:08.580
- How about today?
- You are serious.

17:08.615 --> 17:10.382
- Today?
- If you can.

17:12.017 --> 17:13.952
Fuck it, I'll clear my schedule.

17:13.987 --> 17:15.787
I should tell E.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.288
No no, you shouldn't tell E,

17:17.321 --> 17:19.222
unless you want him
to talk you out of it.

17:19.257 --> 17:21.157
Ah, you know him too well.

17:33.236 --> 17:34.870
You're kidding, right?

17:34.904 --> 17:37.272
I called Tiffany's.
They added a zero by mistake.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.741
They're terribly sorry. They're
sending me a nice gift certificate.

17:39.775 --> 17:42.109
- Oh, lucky you.
- It's yours if you want it.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.944
No, thanks.

17:43.978 --> 17:47.346
- Look, I'm really sorry.
- Okay.

17:47.380 --> 17:49.447
- I brought your check.
- Great.

17:49.482 --> 17:51.315
- Thanks.
- And, hey...

17:51.350 --> 17:53.951
I'm sorry I didn't thank you
for doing that for my mother.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.953
And, yeah, I was
trying to impress you.

17:55.987 --> 17:59.524
That's so sad. If your mom only knew
that's why she was getting a gift...

17:59.558 --> 18:01.860
She'd like it. My mom's a romantic.

18:01.894 --> 18:05.196
Turtle, give it a rest. I thought I
made it clear that I'm not interested.

18:05.230 --> 18:08.934
- And you're starting to get creepy.
- I'm not hitting on you.

18:08.968 --> 18:10.703
Then what are you doing?

18:10.738 --> 18:12.705
I just wanted to make
sure you forgive me.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.540
- Why do you care?
- I don't know.

18:14.574 --> 18:17.540
I like to be liked and
I hate to be hated.

18:17.574 --> 18:20.375
- I don't hate you, okay?
- Okay.

18:20.409 --> 18:22.342
Good. Then I'm gonna go.

18:22.376 --> 18:24.210
And just know I
know when I'm wrong,

18:24.245 --> 18:27.546
and if you ever need me for
anything, I know I owe you one.

18:35.687 --> 18:38.722
- This one sucks.
- Positivity, E, I need it.

18:38.757 --> 18:41.158
I'm pretty positive these all suck.

18:41.192 --> 18:42.892
You're ready to give
up after an hour?

18:42.926 --> 18:46.361
No, but I think we need to try a
different approach with you, Drama.

18:46.396 --> 18:48.330
See, you're very...

18:48.364 --> 18:50.532
- Unique.
- What leading man isn't?

18:50.566 --> 18:52.767
I think we need to build
a show around you.

18:54.537 --> 18:57.139
- How?
- I'm gonna put some calls out to some showrunners.

18:57.173 --> 19:00.142
- Maybe we can get someone to write something for you.
- That's a great idea.

19:00.176 --> 19:02.510
- You think we could find someone?
- It's worth a shot.

19:02.544 --> 19:05.979
Look, E, I know we've had our ups and
downs, but I really appreciate this.

19:06.014 --> 19:08.014
- Have we had downs?
- No,

19:08.049 --> 19:10.082
but we probably will
if we work together.

19:10.116 --> 19:11.883
We're not really working together.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.885
I'd like to make it official.

19:13.919 --> 19:17.554
I want you to manage me...
Real client, real commissions.

19:17.589 --> 19:19.823
What do you say?

19:20.891 --> 19:22.826
Uh, okay...

19:22.860 --> 19:25.161
Drama.

19:25.195 --> 19:27.997
- Should we hug or something?
- I thought you'd never ask.

19:32.268 --> 19:34.068
It's Lloyd.

19:34.102 --> 19:37.504
Hey, if he found something before the
hug, I won't pay a commission on it.

19:37.538 --> 19:40.607
You understand.
Yeah, Lloyd, what do you got?

19:40.641 --> 19:44.343
Johnny, I'm afraid I don't have anything
good to report. I'm really sorry.

19:44.378 --> 19:47.679
Great. Well, my big
gun's got an idea.

19:49.716 --> 19:53.018
- Where's Vince?
- Uh, he left with Lavin.

19:54.086 --> 19:56.120
To go where?

19:59.756 --> 20:01.323
- So any word?
- Not yet.

20:01.357 --> 20:03.191
- Any second though.
- How do you know?

20:03.225 --> 20:05.225
Well, they said that
they would call at 4:00

20:05.260 --> 20:07.894
and it's 3:52. Did you
listen to anything they said?

20:07.928 --> 20:10.095
Yes, Ari, I was listening.

20:10.129 --> 20:12.698
- I think you're nervous.
- I don't get nervous.

20:14.469 --> 20:16.570
Ari Gold's office.

20:16.605 --> 20:19.005
Uh, yes, let me see
if I can get him.

20:21.008 --> 20:22.708
It's Jerry Jones.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.276
- Okay, let me know.
- Stay here.

20:24.310 --> 20:27.912
How are you, Jerry?

20:27.946 --> 20:31.182
Airy, everyone is raving
about your performance.

20:31.216 --> 20:33.450
- Good job, great meeting.
- Well, thank you very much.

20:33.485 --> 20:36.286
- Is there a "but" coming?
- Well, the but is

20:36.320 --> 20:39.456
that the television-rights decisions
are made by all 32 owners,

20:39.490 --> 20:41.323
and it must work pretty
good that way...

20:41.358 --> 20:43.859
We've got the most lucrative
television rights in sports.

20:43.893 --> 20:46.261
- I think I can do better, sir.
- Perhaps, Airy...

20:46.295 --> 20:48.596
- It's Ari.
- But that's just the way we do it.

20:48.630 --> 20:51.465
- We do it internally.
- Well, I think you're making a mistake.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.601
How would you like to come to the next
owners' meeting and have your say?

20:54.636 --> 20:57.570
- I'm not following you.
- Airy... Ari,

20:57.605 --> 21:00.573
we've been wanting a team
in L. A. for a long time.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.608
You may be the man.

21:02.642 --> 21:05.110
How'd you like to own an
N. F. L. Team, Mr. Gold?

21:05.144 --> 21:06.845
I love you. I love it.

21:06.880 --> 21:09.314
Hey, I'll give you a call tomorrow
and we'll talk more about this.

21:09.348 --> 21:11.348
All right.

21:11.382 --> 21:12.582
What was that? What happened?

21:12.616 --> 21:14.617
They're doing the sale internally.

21:14.651 --> 21:17.953
- God damn it.
- But they want me to bring a team to L. A.

21:17.987 --> 21:21.055
- Are you serious?
- What do you think about the name the L. A. Golds?

21:21.090 --> 21:23.024
- I like it.
- I love it!

21:23.058 --> 21:25.726
- Congratulations. Oh my God.
- Congratulations to you. Huh?

21:25.760 --> 21:28.161
- You killed it in there, by the way.
- Thank you.

21:28.196 --> 21:31.164
- Maybe I'll make you a cheerleader, who knows?
- How about G. M.?

21:31.198 --> 21:33.166
Whatever you want.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.502
- You won't believe it, baby.
- Hello, I'm Ari's wife.

21:36.537 --> 21:38.770
Yes, hi. How are you?
So nice to meet you.

21:38.805 --> 21:40.372
I'm Lizzie.

21:42.641 --> 21:44.808
I'm gonna talk to you later.

21:48.146 --> 21:50.814
So that's Lizzie?

21:50.848 --> 21:54.050
The one that fucked
Andrew into rehab?

21:54.084 --> 21:55.517
What are you doing here, baby?

21:55.551 --> 21:57.518
I wanted to show you a
picture of the chandelier.

21:57.552 --> 21:59.486
I'd love it. Let me take
a look at it. Honey...

22:01.088 --> 22:03.722
- Baby. Baby.
- Uh, Nick Cassavetes is on the phone

22:03.756 --> 22:05.523
- and he doesn't sound happy.
- Jesus.

22:08.692 --> 22:11.826
Nick, Vince has been a little
off since the accident.

22:11.861 --> 22:14.897
- He doesn't think the movie sucks.
- I don't care about that.

22:14.931 --> 22:16.867
The movie's great.
I know it and so does the studio.

22:16.901 --> 22:19.704
- What's the problem then?
- The problem? Have you seen his head?

22:19.738 --> 22:22.373
- His head?
- His fucking head, Ari!

22:22.408 --> 22:25.042
I want to do a couple of reshoots.
How am I supposed to do it

22:25.076 --> 22:27.478
when he looks like Tobey
Maguire from "Brothers"?

22:27.512 --> 22:30.280
- Jesus Christ.
- Suck my Dick, Ari.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.951
Get E on the phone.
Put him through to this.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.952
- I'm going home.
- You got it.

22:40.123 --> 22:42.157
How long can we sit here, Bob?

22:42.191 --> 22:45.226
We're gonna sit here till I comprehend
why you blew me off for lunch.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.895
- Oh, come on, it wasn't personal.
- You know what was personal?

22:47.929 --> 22:50.130
I got blown by two
girls last night.

22:50.164 --> 22:52.031
And in the middle of
it, some guy comes home

22:52.066 --> 22:53.899
and says, "what are you
doing with my wives?"

22:53.933 --> 22:55.667
Wives... mormon shit.

22:55.701 --> 22:58.535
- I'm serious.
- Ari's on the phone.

22:58.570 --> 23:01.805
- I gotta take this, Bob.
- In the middle of my blowjob story?

23:01.839 --> 23:05.374
We'll be here all night while I try to
figure out how you could interrupt that.

23:05.409 --> 23:06.876
- Give me five minutes, Bob.
- E!

23:06.910 --> 23:08.812
- Bob.
- What the fuck?

23:08.846 --> 23:10.280
What's up, Ari?

23:10.314 --> 23:12.648
Where's Vince and what the
hell happened to his head?

23:12.683 --> 23:15.484
- How did you know about his head?
- Cassavetes is freaking out.

23:15.518 --> 23:17.085
He wants to do some reshoots.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.854
- He said he cleared it with Cassavetes.
- He did not!

23:19.889 --> 23:22.190
I have some problems at
home I have to take care of.

23:22.224 --> 23:24.625
When you find Vince,
have him call me.

23:24.659 --> 23:28.294
Well... Ari, hold on a second.
That's Vince on the other line.

23:28.329 --> 23:30.430
Vince, where are you?
I'm on the phone with Ari.

23:30.464 --> 23:32.899
- He's freaking out.
- Well, conference him in.

23:34.568 --> 23:37.970
- Ari, we got Vince on the line.
- Vinnie, where are you?

23:38.005 --> 23:40.339
- I'm with one of E's partners.
- We're not partners.

23:40.373 --> 23:43.308
- Whatever you are. What's up, Ari?
- Vince, we need to talk.

23:43.342 --> 23:45.176
- Where are you?
- Would you two relax?

23:45.210 --> 23:48.144
- Cassavetes is having a fit.
- I thought you had taken care of that.

23:48.179 --> 23:50.980
- Ari: The interview isn't the problem.
- Well, what is?

23:51.014 --> 23:53.815
You didn't tell him
you're cutting your hair.

23:53.850 --> 23:55.450
- Uh...
- Vince, you said you did.

23:55.485 --> 23:59.420
Okay, I was a little dazed and
confused on pain meds

23:59.455 --> 24:01.722
- when I shaved my head, E.
- He wants to shoot more scenes.

24:01.756 --> 24:04.057
- Jesus.
- About 15 seconds.

24:04.091 --> 24:06.225
- It's go time, Vince, come on.
- Hey, I'm sorry, guys.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.227
We'll have to talk about
this when I get back.

24:08.261 --> 24:09.861
Get back from where?
Where are you going?

24:09.896 --> 24:11.596
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm jumping out of a plane.

24:11.630 --> 24:14.598
- What?
- We gotta go. We're gonna miss the spot.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.468
It's totally safe. Don't worry.

24:16.502 --> 24:18.870
Hey, don't worry about it, E.
I got him covered.

24:18.904 --> 24:20.772
Vinnie, Vinnie!

24:20.806 --> 24:23.408
- I'll call you from the ground.
- Whoo! Let's go.
