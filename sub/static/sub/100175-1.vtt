        "Heal the Pain")

00:56.157 --> 01:00.559
¶ Ooh ¶

01:00.561 --> 01:05.397
¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

01:05.399 --> 01:09.735
¶ Ooh ¶

01:09.737 --> 01:12.404
¶ Ooh-ooh-ooh ¶

01:12.406 --> 01:15.274
¶ Let me tell you a secret ¶

01:15.276 --> 01:18.777
¶ Put it in your heart
         and keep it ¶

01:18.779 --> 01:22.114
¶ Something that
      I want you to know ¶

01:22.116 --> 01:24.516
¶ Do something for me ¶

01:24.518 --> 01:27.553
¶ Listen to my simple story ¶

01:27.555 --> 01:31.356
¶ And maybe we'll have
      something to show ¶

01:31.358 --> 01:34.626
¶ You tell me you're cold
        on the inside ¶

01:34.628 --> 01:36.962
¶ How can the outside world ¶

01:36.964 --> 01:41.200
¶ Be a place that your heart
         can embrace? ¶

01:41.202 --> 01:45.437
¶ Be good to yourself
      'cause nobody else ¶

01:45.439 --> 01:49.274
¶ Has the power
      to make you happy ¶

01:49.276 --> 01:51.910
¶ How can I help you? ¶

01:51.912 --> 01:53.879
¶ Please let me try to ¶

01:53.881 --> 01:55.881
¶ I can heal the pain ¶

01:55.883 --> 01:58.450
-¶ That you're feeling inside ¶
       -(clicking teeth)

01:58.452 --> 02:00.752
¶ Whenever you want me ¶

02:00.754 --> 02:05.290
¶ Know that I will be
     waiting for the day ¶

02:05.292 --> 02:08.259
¶ That you say you'll be mine ¶

02:08.262 --> 02:09.794
¶ Do do do ¶

02:09.797 --> 02:12.297
¶ Do do do do ¶

02:12.299 --> 02:17.102
¶ Do do do do,
      do do do do do... ¶

02:17.104 --> 02:21.740
¶ Do do do do, do do do do ¶

02:21.742 --> 02:24.076
(humming)

02:24.078 --> 02:26.145
You look like you need another.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.980
What are you, psychic?

02:27.982 --> 02:29.081
Look deep into my eyes.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.016
(chuckles)

02:31.018 --> 02:33.085
Yeah.
  You're feeling very thirsty.

02:33.087 --> 02:35.087
Oh, you are very good.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.089
-And... -("Heal the Pain"
   by George Michael playing)

02:37.091 --> 02:38.924
Oh, yeah,
  this is your favorite song.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.259
That was so psychic.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.961
No, that was you playing it
      four times in a row.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.530
Well, love me,
      love George Michael.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.098
We're kindred spirits.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.333
-How so?
   -Well, we're both singers.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.768
Uh, we're both
     famously misunderstood

02:49.770 --> 02:51.203
and underappreciated
          in our time.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.105
But all that's gonna change,

02:53.107 --> 02:55.274
'cause tomorrow I've got a
 big audition for the West End.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.177
And you, uh,
     came into town for it?

02:58.179 --> 03:00.679
No, I, uh, moved out
     on my flatmate today.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.114
So, what,
  you're gonna move back home?

03:02.116 --> 03:05.284
-Oh, kill me now.
     -Uh-oh. Family issues.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.052
Yeah. Let me count the ways.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.121
Um, anger, shame, resentment,

03:09.123 --> 03:10.455
embarrassment--
    and that's just my mum.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.124
Do you want to hear
        about my sister?

03:12.126 --> 03:13.125
-No. Okay.
          -(laughing)

03:13.127 --> 03:14.660
So, what's your plan?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.028
I'll figure it out, you know.

03:16.030 --> 03:17.663
It'll be fine.
    Something will turn up.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.298
Or someone.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.837
Morning, gorgeous.

03:25.839 --> 03:29.208
This bed, it's like sleeping
     on a pile of kittens.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.844
If that thought's comfortable

03:32.846 --> 03:34.913
-and not completely horrifying.
          -(chuckles)

03:34.915 --> 03:36.682
I'm gonna dash down the street.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.517
I need some gingerroot,
          fresh beets

03:38.519 --> 03:40.152
for my famous
     breakfast power juice.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.753
-Cool.
            -And...

03:41.755 --> 03:44.723
-a cappuccino while you wait.
             -Wow.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.892
And lashings of hot water
     if you fancy a shower.

03:46.894 --> 03:50.028
-Bliss.
      -I'll be right back.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.930
(sighs, chuckles)

03:51.932 --> 03:54.032
-(door opens)
       -WOMAN: Surprise!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.335
Guess who got back from
  the conference a day early.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.769
God, I've missed you.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.571
(both scream)

03:59.573 --> 04:00.672
God, who are you?!

04:00.674 --> 04:02.407
I'm the... plumber.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.442
-The plumber?
      -Look... (stammers)

04:03.444 --> 04:04.676
This isn't what it looks like.
           I just...

04:04.678 --> 04:06.245
I just... I needed a bed
    for the night, and he...

04:06.247 --> 04:09.014
-Ed. -Ed. Ed was just
       so understanding.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.782
And I-I just... I just... I've
 got lots of issues, all right?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.517
Accommodation, firstly, 'cause
I've sort of run out of options

04:12.519 --> 04:14.253
because I've really messed up
    for a number of reasons.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.420
-And he...
              -Ed.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.555
Ed just seemed to get that.

04:17.558 --> 04:18.724
Did you shag him?

04:18.726 --> 04:21.026
("Last Christmas"
       by Wham! playing)

04:21.028 --> 04:22.527

04:22.529 --> 04:25.030
Look, you took my bag!

04:25.032 --> 04:26.198

04:26.200 --> 04:28.433
Ow!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.402

04:30.404 --> 04:32.371

You are never early.
      What are you up to?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.319
Accommodation issues.

06:27.321 --> 06:29.721
Hmm. So the usual.
   What did you do this time?

06:29.723 --> 06:32.391
-Fry someone's fish?
  -No, no, that was last week.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.502
You are going to run out
     of friends with sofas.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.870
You have been sick.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.405
You need to take care
      of yourself better.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.573
-Santa, I didn't know
   you cared. -I don't care.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.442
I just don't want you to drop
dead in front of the customers.

06:50.444 --> 06:53.345
I don't have enough tinsel
     to cover your corpse.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.013
Get to work, elf.

I don't know.

You're gonna have to
        help me decide.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.091
-They're both so darling.
       -I tell you what.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.794
Let's pretend Mary had twins,
     and you can get both.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.095
(both laugh)

07:10.097 --> 07:11.596
You must just love your job.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.366
-Love it.
  -It's like being in a dream.

07:14.368 --> 07:17.402
All the joys and the love
          of Christmas

-every single day of the year.
          -(chuckles)

07:20.207 --> 07:21.807
Now, which baby
       is it going to be?

07:21.809 --> 07:24.409
He's gorgeous, but this one...

07:24.411 --> 07:26.144
he looks like he's having
         a lot of fun.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.246
-Oh, yeah, and a lot more
     to come. -(both laugh)

07:28.248 --> 07:30.816
-But this one, look at him.
         -Come on. Hey.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.117
-He's more like my idea of...
         -Jesus Christ.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.652
-You think so, too?
           -Katarina.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.387
Um, excuse me
  for just one moment. Santa!

07:35.389 --> 07:36.388
I need a word.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.789
I'm at work.
    You could've called me.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.224
You're not answering
          your phone.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.559
Remember?
   Look, I've come from work.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.761
I need to get back,
     so come get out here.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.563
That's my analyst.
           So sorry.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.398
Santa, can you get
       down here, please?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.267
Please? Thank you.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.470
Santa?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.505
Are you there?

07:54.508 --> 07:56.942
Mum needs you to ring her.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.410
All right, every time
        she contacts you

07:58.412 --> 08:00.412
and gets no response,
        she contacts me.

08:00.414 --> 08:02.280
Yesterday, 17 times.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.483
-Just do it. -Oh, don't just
 stand there issuing commands.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.151
I am an adult.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.720
You are the furthest thing
   from an adult that I know.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.456
I need time to myself.

08:11.458 --> 08:14.693
I'm asking you to do
   a single thing, Katarina.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.694
It's "Kate."

08:15.696 --> 08:17.329
Whatever. Just ring her.
          Contact her.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.530
Give me one good reason.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.532
You've missed five
     doctor's appointments.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.867
You've got one planned
 for tomorrow, which apparently

08:21.869 --> 08:23.301
you know about.
     You have to be there.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.670
She's also planning a dinner
   to celebrate my promotion.

08:25.672 --> 08:29.140
And you not ringing her
is seriously affecting my life.

08:29.142 --> 08:32.043
Will you be inviting Alba
         to the dinner?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.113
Just ring your mother.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.048
Christ.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.850
(sighs)

08:38.852 --> 08:40.184
Yeah, Jenna, it's me.
        Listen, darling,

08:40.187 --> 08:41.520
I'm sorry
     to leave this message.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.455
I just really need
      a bed for the night.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.023
Even possibly a few nights.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.625
-You're my bestie. Please.
       I know. -(grunts)

08:46.627 --> 08:48.126
-Just...
           -Hey, elf!

08:48.128 --> 08:49.828
This is my elf.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.363
Santa has elves, you know.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.064
Little helpers.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.900
I have nicknamed her
         "Lazy the Elf"

08:54.902 --> 08:56.501
because she appears
         never to work.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.403
-That's me. Mm.
   -She could also be called

08:58.405 --> 09:00.505
-"Crushing Disappointment
     the Elf." -(laughter)

09:00.507 --> 09:02.574
-I-I'm just... (clears throat)
  -"Waste of Payroll the Elf,"

09:02.576 --> 09:04.209
"Bleeding Me Dry the Elf,"

09:04.211 --> 09:06.378
"Why on Earth Is She
      Even Here the Elf."

09:06.380 --> 09:07.546

09:42.382 --> 09:44.349
-Where'd you come from?
-Well, what are you looking at?

09:44.351 --> 09:45.884
Look, look.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.953
There. You see it?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.689
-KATE: Oh. -Just above
   the lip of the roof there.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.024
It's quite unusual to see
   a bird like that in town.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.292
-Blimey.
       -(bird screeches)

09:54.294 --> 09:56.595
(groans) Damn it.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.630
Here. Uh, I think
   it just pooed in your eye.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.065
Yeah, I think so.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.700
-SANTA: Goodbye, my people.
       -KATE: Sorry. Ow.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.301
-(Santa speaks Mandarin)
              -Ow.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.402
-Where have you been?
           -(groans)

10:04.404 --> 10:05.403
A shitting bird
      just shat in my eye.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.738
-Oh. Is there a bird in here?
              -No.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.474
Some bloke was outside the shop
     playing silly buggers.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.209
Well, maybe you can focus
         your attention

10:11.211 --> 10:13.211
-on the silly buggers inside
   the shop. -(phone ringing)

10:13.213 --> 10:15.213
I know. Oh! My phone.
         Sorry. Sorry.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.581
I'm sorry, Santa.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.949
Yeah, Jenna!

10:17.951 --> 10:20.385
Yes! Thank you so much.
       Thank you so much.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.953
Thank you so...
 I'll be with you around 8:00.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.555
-Okay. You are number one.
    -Get off the phone now!

10:23.557 --> 10:24.556
Okay, I got to go. Bye.

10:24.558 --> 10:26.291
Yeah, I'm just gonna get
      the shit out my eye.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.759
-I'll be right...
       -Time to sparkle!

10:27.761 --> 10:29.728
¶ Just hear those
    sleigh bells jingling ¶

10:29.730 --> 10:31.563
¶ Ring-ting-tingling, too... ¶

10:31.565 --> 10:34.332
There you are, sir. Enjoy your
 festive hybrid Hanukkah bush.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.467
Merry Christmas to you.
           Thank you.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.135
Thank you. Take care.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.170
(ringtone playing):
¶ She drives me crazy, she... ¶

10:39.172 --> 10:40.572
SANTA:
       Your mother again?

10:40.574 --> 10:42.674
-I curse the day I was born.
           -Me, too.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.609
Ha! Funny, no. I installed
    everything on her phone

10:44.611 --> 10:45.644
from Snapchat to Instagram.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.078
All it means is that

10:47.080 --> 10:48.747
I can disappoint her
    in more ways than ever.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.115
Mothers are hell.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.583
Oh, yeah.

10:51.585 --> 10:52.684
KATE:
              Mm.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.619
Hello.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.855
-Leave him to me.
              -Oh!

10:56.857 --> 10:59.324
You'll just flirt with him, and
 he'll forget to buy anything.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.960
-Hi.
      -How can I help you?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.496
Wouldn't mind finding him
        in my stocking.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.267
-Hi.
        -(yells) Hi. Hi.

11:09.269 --> 11:11.102
I came in to check on your eye.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.270
It's fine.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.005
-It's good luck, you know.
           -What is?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.473
Getting pooed on by a bird.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.475
-Bollocks is it.
        -No, seriously.

11:17.477 --> 11:20.211
So I thought I'd see
         if you fancied

11:20.213 --> 11:22.313
-a little stroll with me.
      -Oh, that's my luck?

11:22.315 --> 11:24.449
-Going for a stroll with you?
           -Might be.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.518
Look, did you find me
           on Swiper?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.719
-Swiper?
             -Yeah.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.821
The modern dating application
    you might have heard of.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.456
Oh. So not.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.857
Look, to be honest,
   you're not really my type.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.492
To be honest,
    you're not really mine.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.127
(opens drawer)

11:36.129 --> 11:38.463
Well, maybe we should
      just leave it, then.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.565
I do like a challenge, though.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.834
-You considered BASE jumping?
        -(closes drawer)

11:42.836 --> 11:44.803
-Japanese blowfish?
          -No, I have,

11:44.805 --> 11:46.838
but right now I'm considering
   a little stroll with you.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.840
Well, consider away,
       because it's a no.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.742
Is there anything
   that I could improve upon

11:50.744 --> 11:52.711
to, say, persuade you?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.412
-No.
   -Any reason in particular?

11:54.414 --> 11:56.314
Because you're weird, this is
  weird, and I don't know you.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.916
So, please, could you
 just leave, okay? Just get...

11:57.918 --> 11:59.484
-Shoo. Just go. Just go.
    -Hold on. This is weird?

11:59.486 --> 12:00.652
Let's just...
      Yeah, you're weird.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.187
-You're strange. I don't
really... -Weirder than Grabber

12:02.189 --> 12:03.421
-or Swiper or whatever
      it's called? -Yeah.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.424
(sighs) Oh, just...

12:06.426 --> 12:08.093
Weirder than total strangers

12:08.095 --> 12:09.761
deciding on
     one Photoshopped image

12:09.763 --> 12:11.896
whether or not to engage
     in immediate foreplay?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.065
I'm busy.
     You're weird. Goodbye.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.077

12:26.079 --> 12:29.514

-(drawer closes)
       -(register beeps)

12:37.691 --> 12:39.023
Good evening.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.759
Good eve... (gasps)

12:42.362 --> 12:44.262
Can I help you?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.930
I think so.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.567
Go on, then.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.570
What is it
     you were looking for?

12:52.572 --> 12:54.105
Um...

12:55.876 --> 12:57.575
This.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.944
That is very nice.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.380
It's Mr. Claus, I believe.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.581
Yes.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.216
Upon his vehicle.

13:05.218 --> 13:08.086
-Yes.
   -Do you have something...

13:08.088 --> 13:09.621
dissimilar?

13:09.623 --> 13:11.089
Yes.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.125
We have many...
       dissimilar items.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.497
Uh, for instance,
     this Christmas gibbon.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.735
(high-pitched voice):
       ¶ Last Christmas ¶

13:23.737 --> 13:25.570

13:30.010 --> 13:32.477

13:32.479 --> 13:34.846
It is amusing.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.915
I think so, too.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.017
-¶ Special, special,
   special... ¶ -(screeches)

13:39.019 --> 13:40.251

13:40.253 --> 13:42.487
I'll come back for it.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.024
Yes.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.993
-Yes.
   -(sets figure on counter)

13:51.631 --> 13:53.231
SANTA (hushed):
              Yes.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.774
Wow.

14:02.776 --> 14:05.109
That was like watching
   a short Scandinavian film.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.880
Are you all right?

14:08.882 --> 14:10.682
-Yes, I'm fine.
   -(sets gibbon on counter)

14:10.684 --> 14:13.685
Wait. Hang on.
      Did you... like him?

14:13.687 --> 14:15.687
You're so mysterious,
         I can't tell.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.288
Of course not.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.058
Oh, my God, you did like him.
            (gasps)

14:20.060 --> 14:22.060
I don't know anything
           about him.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.895
And you're fantasizing, elf,

14:23.897 --> 14:27.365
because all you seem to
 think about these days is sex.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.033
Ooh.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.806
-Oh, my God, he's coming back.
            -Where?!

14:34.808 --> 14:36.875
Got you.
     I knew you liked him.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.309
Well, now I know.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.979
You like your men tall,
      shy and translucent,

14:40.981 --> 14:43.014
like a squid but with bones
         and less legs.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.083
Shut up, lock up,
        and good night.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.085
-Mm-hmm.
      -(cell phone chimes)

14:48.755 --> 14:50.221

       in Serbo-Croatian)

15:14.748 --> 15:16.214
No, no, no, no, no, no!

15:16.216 --> 15:18.016
Please wait, please wait,
          please wait!

15:18.018 --> 15:19.751
He was... he was very good.

15:19.753 --> 15:21.619
Not for me.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.721
-Charming.
           -Jarring.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.390
DIRECTOR: I would put him
        in "maybe plus."

         "Maybe plus."

-Hi. Sorry.
            -Hi. Oh.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.297
-So sorry. I'm late.
   -CASTING DIRECTOR: Sorry.

-The auditions are closed now.
          -Right, yes.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.234
I was on the list.
  No, my name's Kate Andrich.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.202
Yeah, there was just a terrible
   accident on the way here.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.604
Was, uh, Santa involved?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.039
Well, yeah.
    She was, actually, yeah.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.275
"She"? Oh, is this like a
 "God being a woman now" thing?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.311
Oh, no, no, no.
These are just my work clothes.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.712
-Don't worry about it.
      -Where do you work?

15:47.714 --> 15:48.713
Elf and safety?

15:48.715 --> 15:49.981
Uh... (laughs)

15:49.983 --> 15:51.482
Not exactly.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.817
-Uh, I'm so sorry.
   -CASTING DIRECTOR: Sorry.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.886
-You're gonna have to come back
   next time. -It's too late.

DIRECTOR: Well, you know what?
          Let her go.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.723

-We don't know.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.793
Plus, I've never seen an elf
        audition before.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.294

16:03.296 --> 16:05.096
Um, yeah. Take it away,

    can I plug in my music?

16:11.404 --> 16:13.338
-Great.
          -A cappella.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.073
The penalty for lateness.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.607
Yeah, I can do that. Okay.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.676
Sure.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.345
Okay.

Whoa! (gasps)

-You again?
  -What do you mean, "again"?

16:54.547 --> 16:55.813
Did you follow me here?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.215
No, I made a delivery here.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.951
-Yeah?
 -Are elves always so cynical?

16:59.953 --> 17:02.720
Yes, relentlessly.

 followed you here... -Mm-hmm.

    by chance, here we are.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.031

Well, for instance, we could go
      for a walk together.

17:14.968 --> 17:17.167
Why do you keep trying
     to take me for a walk?

17:17.170 --> 17:19.237
-I'm not a dog. -Well,
   you are wearing a collar.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.838
Oh, LOL. You know what?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.973
I'm just not in the mood
          for a walk.

17:22.976 --> 17:23.974
Why?

17:23.977 --> 17:25.343
Well, fine. Okay.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.979
I was just incredibly bad
          at what I do

17:27.981 --> 17:30.181
in front of people
  who could've given me a job.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.215
I thought you had a job.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.984
Yes, but it's not
        what I "do" do.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.252
I'm not a career elf.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.154
Oh. What do you do?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.588
(grunts rhythmically)

17:37.590 --> 17:38.990
Sing.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.658
Wow. That's pretty amazing.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.528
I just can't seem to...
         at the moment.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.830
Anyway, boring, boring, boring,
        la, la, la, la.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.098
I'm not bored.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.200
Actually, who are you?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.735
I'm Tom.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.271
Kate.

17:53.273 --> 17:54.839
Why are you so flexible?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.541
Why are you dressed
          like an elf?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.409
You know why.
       And you know what?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.411
I have had my fill

18:00.413 --> 18:03.014
of utterly hilarious elf jokes
         for one night.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.615
Cover me.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.020
-Here?
             -Here.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.389
You are now my cupboard door.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.558
-(grunting)
          -(Tom sighs)

18:13.560 --> 18:15.460
-So, you do this often?
     -Only when I have to.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.694
-TOM: Uh...
         -KATE: Okay...

18:16.696 --> 18:18.029
-(man whistles)
         -(man hooting)

18:18.031 --> 18:19.197
KATE:
         Oh, piss off.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.198
Nice covering.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.699
I'm-I'm trying my best here.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.101
(Kate whistles)

18:23.103 --> 18:24.602
Ooh. Thanks.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.770
TOM (sighs):
             Okay.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.705
Okay. Oh, no. Hang on.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.373
(bells jingling)

18:29.375 --> 18:32.043
-Where are we going?
      -This way. Come on.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.678
(grunts)

18:34.747 --> 18:36.080
Oh...

18:36.082 --> 18:37.381
(Tom sighs)

18:37.383 --> 18:39.283
-Look at that.
              -Oh.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.785
You never seen
     this alleyway before?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.888
-Nope. -This is
 the narrowest alley in London.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.824
My mate Hendo, he calls it
      "Fat Man's Squeeze."

18:46.826 --> 18:49.794
-It's pretty cool, though,
   isn't it? -Sure. Why not?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.329
I like hidden places.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.064
Has anyone ever told you
       there's something

18:53.066 --> 18:55.633
slightly serial killer-y
           about you?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.768
No. Come to think of it,
         no one's ever

18:57.770 --> 18:59.303
-said that to me before.
              -Ah.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.172
TOM:
 Never more than once, anyway.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.644
Why are you always
         dancing about?

19:06.646 --> 19:07.879
Look up.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.481
Oh, wow.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.950
-Are they mice?
       -Yeah, I think so.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.153
There must be a story
       attached to them.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.121
I'll have to find out one day.

19:17.123 --> 19:20.525
-Yeah. I mean, it's very...
           -Come on.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.660
(laughing):
      You are so strange.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.196
-You're so weird.
       -Keep looking up.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.932
-Oh! Ow.
    -(thud, objects clatter)

19:27.934 --> 19:30.034
-You okay?
         -(groans) No!

19:30.036 --> 19:33.104
Just my luck, I face-plant
     into a pile of rubbish

19:33.106 --> 19:35.139
because I wasn't looking
       where I was going

19:35.141 --> 19:36.374
like a bloody normal person.

19:36.376 --> 19:37.842
Well, you're not
      used to looking up.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.477
Or smelling like a bin.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.547
-Seen this?
          -Seen what?

19:42.549 --> 19:44.715
-KATE (laughing): Oh, my God.
          -TOM: Yeah.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.284
I've walked down this street
         so many times.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.785
I've never seen that before.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.054
Like I say. Follow me.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.490
(quietly):
              Ooh.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.559
(bell tolling)

19:58.731 --> 20:00.731
¶ ¶

20:08.541 --> 20:10.408
(Kate chuckles quietly)

20:14.147 --> 20:15.780
KATE:
         This is cool.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.883
Welcome to my secret
         little garden.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.185
KATE:
  I had no idea this existed.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.887
TOM:
      Not many people do.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.556
(Kate sighs)

20:25.558 --> 20:27.858
Oh. Have a look over there.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.026
-It's Gideon.
          -KATE: Yes.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.361
TOM:
    He's recently divorced.

20:30.363 --> 20:33.698
-Oh.
-He owes £748 in child support.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.033
How do you know?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.768
I heard him have a very loud
       phone conversation

20:37.770 --> 20:39.036
right behind that shrub.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.572
KATE: Well, he probably thought
     no one could hear him.

20:41.574 --> 20:45.176
-Oh, and that's Geoff,
     a Mafia don. -Really?

20:45.178 --> 20:47.612
-No. He works at Burger King.
           -(laughs)

20:47.614 --> 20:50.781
He's also a vegan,
      so very conflicted.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.450
Who's she?

20:52.452 --> 20:53.751
TOM:
         That's Ursula.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.586
She lives in the flats
        around the back.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.089
She runs a brothel
     down in Bethnal Green.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.958
Now, some of the girls,
they used to come, take a seat,

21:00.960 --> 21:03.728
just have a chat,
   and then go back to work.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.896
KATE: Do you think
   she was giving them tips?

21:05.898 --> 21:07.198
TOM:
              No.

21:07.200 --> 21:10.067
More like a bit of support.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.569
I want to talk to her.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.971
No, you can't do that.
      No, no, no, no, no.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.606
Everyone keeps
everyone's secrets around here.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.275
It's like an unspoken rule.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.944
Well, you just told me
           Gideon's.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.612
Fair point.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.548
You're one of us now.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.489
(both sigh)

21:31.491 --> 21:33.291
So, when's your next audition?

21:33.293 --> 21:34.625
Saturday.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.727
-It's for <i> Frozen. </i>
         -What's that?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.263
You... (laughs)
     You really don't know?

21:39.265 --> 21:41.232
-No, really.
     -Okay. It's a film...

21:41.234 --> 21:43.567
about two sisters
who used to get on really well,

21:43.569 --> 21:45.136
and then don't

21:45.138 --> 21:49.307
because one of them
    has a problem with ice.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.442
And the production is...
            on ice!

21:51.444 --> 21:54.245
Huh. So, you can skate
        as well as sing?

21:54.247 --> 21:56.180
-No.
       -You can't skate?

21:56.182 --> 21:58.149
Never tried it.
       I'm gonna wing it.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.617
It'll be cool.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.252
I really enjoyed
        our walk today.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.353
Ditto.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.255
Would you like to...

22:04.257 --> 22:05.923
repeat the experience?

22:05.925 --> 22:07.658
Would you like
    to give me your number?

22:07.660 --> 22:09.026
I don't have a phone.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.695
What? (stammers)

22:10.697 --> 22:13.197
(laughing): Oh, my God,
 I was just beginning to think

22:13.199 --> 22:15.099
you're not as weird
       as you look. Uh...

22:15.101 --> 22:17.268
Before you throw me in the bin
         with the rest

22:17.270 --> 22:19.003
of your battered conquests,
            it's...

22:19.005 --> 22:21.539
not completely true.
       I do have a phone.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.008
-It's just locked
      in a cupboard. -Why?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.544
Well, I got so tired
 of staring at my hand all day.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.712
I mean, you should try it.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.146
That's like saying
     you should try death.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.648
-(ringtone playing)
    -I think somebody really

22:30.650 --> 22:32.116
-wants to get hold of you.
       -Yeah, no, I know.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.384
Someone really isn't
     gonna get the chance.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.553
-¶ She drives me crazy... ¶
      -(clears throat) No.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.455
Ditch that.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.690
All of your stresses
      will just melt away.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.826
Oh, but I just like stress.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.127
-(horn honks)
          -DRIVER: Oi.

22:43.129 --> 22:44.462
You getting on?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.464
-Yeah.
     -Your chariot awaits.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.332
Indeed.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.634
-(grunts)
  -I'll see you at the store.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.703
-Okay.
  -And don't forget-- look up.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.605
Oh, for God's sake,
       shut up, will you?

22:56.342 --> 22:58.042
(chuckles quietly)

22:58.044 --> 23:00.044
¶ ¶

23:20.166 --> 23:23.167
(sighs softly)

23:23.169 --> 23:26.404
-(sighing, chuckling): Hi. Hey.
    -Hi. Thank you so much.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.239
-Thank you so much. Thank you
so much. -It's okay. It's okay.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.108
And your suite, madame.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.010
-(Kate chuckling)
            -Ta-da!

23:33.012 --> 23:35.513
JENNA: You called, uh,
just before we got the crib up,

23:35.515 --> 23:37.748
-so there was still room. Yeah.
             -Yeah.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.552
This is gonna be so good
  for my sex life. (chuckles)

23:41.554 --> 23:43.287
(both laughing)

23:43.289 --> 23:45.289
(music playing quietly)

23:48.861 --> 23:50.428
KATE:
             Mm...

23:50.430 --> 23:51.762
Hey, Ruf.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.930
-Hey, Kate.
       -Thanks for this.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.765
-Holding up?
  -Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.767
-Fine. Totally fine.
      -How's it all been?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.102
-¶ She drives me crazy... ¶
           -(groans)

23:58.104 --> 23:59.870
JENNA: Reentry and all that.
          How's Santa?

23:59.872 --> 24:01.439
Oh, you know, fine.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.375
Her usual, curt, Asian self.

24:04.377 --> 24:06.777
I thought you might have
      decided to move on.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.279
No, no. (grunts)

24:08.281 --> 24:09.947
What, with something
that started as a Saturday job?

24:09.949 --> 24:12.316
Yeah. Comfy where I am.

24:12.318 --> 24:14.752
(Serbian accent): And, um,
   uh, what about your folks

24:14.754 --> 24:16.253
and mad Marta?

24:16.255 --> 24:18.622
-With her law firm
    and her briefcase. -Ah.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.658
(Serbian accent): I stay out
  of contact with the crazies.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.659
(normal accent):
         Um, you know,

24:21.661 --> 24:22.960
just to give myself
        a bit of space.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.295
Are the doctors
       keeping in touch?

24:24.297 --> 24:26.931
-How about being pregnant? Huh?
            -(sighs)

24:26.933 --> 24:28.098
For crying out loud,
          how's that?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.100
JENNA: It is a total
   conspiracy, is what it is.

24:30.102 --> 24:31.836
-Yeah? -Yeah, they lie
    to you about pregnancy.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.237
You know the whole glowing,

24:33.239 --> 24:34.738
mother-to-be image
      you see in the ads?

24:34.740 --> 24:35.973
-Yeah.
      -It's just bollocks.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.675
You know, genuine bollocks.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.077
It's just
    a nine-month-long trauma

24:40.079 --> 24:42.146
-spent piddling into cups...
   -(sighs) Of course it is.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.082
...being poked up the vag
 by strangers with cold hands,

24:45.084 --> 24:47.117
and, you know, if men
      had to do this shit,

24:47.119 --> 24:48.686
we would have
      contraceptive beer.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.287
You know, actually,
      if men had to do it,

24:50.289 --> 24:51.589
the human race
      would just die out.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.023
-Sh...
           -No, Ruf.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.092
I know you know all this,
    and I know you're fed up

24:55.094 --> 24:56.160
with feminism
       in general, but...

24:56.162 --> 24:57.428
I'm not fed up with feminism.

24:57.430 --> 25:00.431
No, I mean,
      she's not listening.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.399
(snoring softly)

25:04.303 --> 25:06.036
That's not right.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.039
This is a fish knife.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.442
I'm trying to cut a passion
    fruit with a fish knife.

25:11.444 --> 25:12.643
If anyone can do it, you can.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.844
It's your fault.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.012
You did this.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.156
Wha...
     Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.025
-Hi.
   -Come and grab some food.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.460
Oh, yeah.

25:29.462 --> 25:30.728
(Kate groans)

25:30.730 --> 25:31.862
(softly):
         Good sleeping.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.365
Anyone up for a,
        you know, pizza?

25:34.367 --> 25:35.799
Bottle of Rioja?

25:35.801 --> 25:36.867
Mm. Celiac.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.569
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

25:38.571 --> 25:42.172
And preggers, so we ain't
 drinking, either, party girl.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.675
-(Jenna chuckles)
   -Okay. Well, I'm off out.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.644
Okay. I'll see you later.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.746
I won't be too late.
           I promise.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.115
Yeah, all right. Peace out.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.885
-(door closes)
            -Don't.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.520
She's my oldest friend.

25:56.522 --> 25:57.688
I know it seems like she's...

25:57.690 --> 25:59.156
The most selfish woman
         in the world?

25:59.158 --> 26:00.424
Oof. Harsh.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.859
She's been ill.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.861
I'm over the galleon,
      but one more thing,

26:03.863 --> 26:05.496
and my legendary patience
         will crumble.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.865
Don't bring that up.
  She burned her eyebrows off.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.501
Her eyebrows will grow back.
 You know what won't grow back?

26:10.503 --> 26:11.669
(Jenna laughing)

26:11.671 --> 26:13.504
-(grunts)
      -(screams) Oh, my...

26:13.506 --> 26:14.605
My matchstick galleon.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.507
No, I agree.
      One, and she's out.

26:16.509 --> 26:18.008

26:34.527 --> 26:36.126
(muttering, grunting)
        Okay. Thank you.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.628
You take me for
     the full English now?

26:37.630 --> 26:39.430
No, mate. You had
  the full English last night.

26:39.432 --> 26:40.764

Hi.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.636
Morning. Hello.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.937
Happy? A good morning.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.539
It's brilliant.
     It's lovely, isn't it?

26:48.541 --> 26:50.474
Well, someone looks not rested.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.443
What? Me? No, fine.
         Totally fine.

26:52.445 --> 26:53.911
Able to leap sofas
      in a single bound...

26:53.913 --> 26:57.281

CHURCHILL: Just gonna
    write this out for you.

27:22.575 --> 27:24.842
CROWLEY: Oh, they've had a
right go in here, haven't they?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.076
-KATE: Oh, God.
      -Probably just kids.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.645
-Yeah, I reckon it's just kids.
          -Just kids.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.613
-Yeah.
   -Like, yeah, I just said.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.415
This is your crime number.
 You'll need it for insurance.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.449
-Thank you.
        -What happened?

27:32.451 --> 27:33.651
Break-in, I'm afraid.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.753
Very common this time of year.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.621
-Place like this is
      a prime target. -Mm.

27:37.623 --> 27:38.922
Lovely, it is.

27:38.924 --> 27:40.424
Is that a crocodile
         with pompoms?

27:41.827 --> 27:43.127
Yes.

27:43.129 --> 27:45.129
And, uh, who... who's this?

27:45.131 --> 27:47.831
This is my employee.
   She locked up last night,

27:47.833 --> 27:49.933
so please ask her
      if she saw anything.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.204
Nothing out of the ordinary.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.539
Are you writing that down?

27:55.541 --> 27:57.007
I am.
  How do you spell "ordinary"?

27:57.009 --> 27:58.175
Well, we're done here.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.843
We'll be in touch
      if we hear anything.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.311
Mm, pity.
      It's a lovely place.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.881
-It is. I love Christmas.
        -No, you don't.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.215
You make
    "have a merry Christmas"

28:05.217 --> 28:06.517
sound like a death threat.

28:06.519 --> 28:07.651
What are you talking about?

28:07.653 --> 28:09.119
Merry Christmas.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.320
Have yourself
    a merry Christmas, yeah?

28:10.322 --> 28:12.156
-You see? You just did it.
       -What do you mean,

28:12.158 --> 28:13.557
-I just did it?
       -You just did it.

28:13.559 --> 28:15.192
Let me get my phone out.
        I'll record you,

28:15.194 --> 28:16.660
and you'll realize
 you sound like Jason Statham.

28:16.662 --> 28:17.728
CROWLEY:
   Well, that's a good thing,

28:17.730 --> 28:18.796
'cause I love Jason Statham,

28:18.798 --> 28:20.330
-so that's not even an insult.
          -Santa, I...

28:20.332 --> 28:21.732
-Don't talk to me.
       -But, listen, I...

28:21.734 --> 28:23.534
I said, "Don't talk to me."

28:23.536 --> 28:25.402
You forgot to lock up.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.870
Don't deny it.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.906
Well, I can pay you back.

28:31.644 --> 28:34.678
Now, you listen to me
      and you listen good.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.247
You were great at your job
       when you started.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.817
That's why I took you on
           full-time.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.151
You've got a way with people,

28:41.153 --> 28:44.488
and I felt so lucky
          to have you.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.723
Thanks.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.925
But I don't feel lucky anymore.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.261
Since you came back,
 you started losing your shit.

28:51.263 --> 28:53.997
It's like you don't care
        about anything.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.902
So, now, you care about this.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.038
I had to smash my own window

29:01.040 --> 29:02.606
to make it look
        like a break-in.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.675
Otherwise,
 I wouldn't get the insurance.

29:04.677 --> 29:06.110
(grunts softly)

29:06.112 --> 29:09.813
You turned me into someone
       who broke the law.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.949
(stammers quietly)

29:13.586 --> 29:16.687
I can't believe I'm even
   giving you another chance,

29:16.689 --> 29:18.288
but I am because...

29:19.391 --> 29:21.358
-I am a good person.
             -Yeah.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.595
But one more thing,
        and you're out.

-and Santa's taken it
     really badly. -Right.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.754

I meant I haven't got a place
   to stay that I've chosen.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.894
I choose not to go back
     to my parents' house.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.062

You know, how do you even know
      if you have a life?

32:34.920 --> 32:36.386
Does anything official arrive
        that tells you?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.221
Like an envelope and something
 that's like, "Dear so-and-so,

32:38.223 --> 32:40.724
you now have a life.
 We wish you'd get on with it."

32:40.726 --> 32:43.760

          -No, no, no.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.743
Your mother is still up.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.012
I like to wait
      until she's asleep.

She talks less.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.916

33:05.918 --> 33:08.318
Why don't you just
      get a divorce? Huh?

33:08.320 --> 33:10.153
-Mm. -Been avoiding
     each other for years.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.023
No.
  No, divorce is for the rich.

33:29.641 --> 33:32.009
(dog barking in distance)

33:39.385 --> 33:41.084
(grunts)

33:47.059 --> 33:48.925
Mum?

33:50.562 --> 33:53.130
Mum, would you let me in?

33:53.132 --> 33:56.033
Mum? Would... Mum!

33:57.669 --> 34:00.637
Nailed it shut. Mental.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.006
KGB! Open up!

34:03.008 --> 34:05.876
-KGB! -PETRA: <i> Ne, ne, ne, ne. </i>
        -(lock clicking)

34:05.878 --> 34:07.244
<i> Ne, ne, ne, ne.</i> Stop.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.012
Stop. You are very bad girl.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.480
Would you prefer the KGB?

34:10.482 --> 34:12.382
KGB. (clicks tongue)

34:12.384 --> 34:13.750
You don't make joke about

34:13.752 --> 34:15.217
what you don't understand.
        (clicks tongue)

34:15.219 --> 34:16.920
Yeah, well, can I just come in?
            Can I...

34:16.922 --> 34:18.722
-What you done? You look like
    dead person. -Oh, yeah.

34:18.724 --> 34:19.989
Thanks.
    Great parenting. Great.

34:19.992 --> 34:21.858
-Why don't you do it inside?
    -Why don't you ring me?

34:21.860 --> 34:22.893
-(Kate groans)
        -You have phone.

34:22.895 --> 34:23.860
Uh, it-it's broken.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.262
(Petra exclaims
       in Serbo-Croatian)

34:25.264 --> 34:29.331
Why you not ring me
    when I worry about you?!

34:29.333 --> 34:31.501
Not to hear nothing.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.737
No call, no Twitter,

34:33.739 --> 34:37.107
no Snap... chat shot.

34:37.109 --> 34:39.208
I think she's dead,
        she's had lapse,

34:39.210 --> 34:40.610
she's never coming home,

34:40.612 --> 34:43.580
like her father
       who is never here.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.416
My life is hell, Katarina.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.085
It's "Kate." It's "Kate."

34:48.087 --> 34:49.753
"Kate" is not a name.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.621
"Katarina" is name.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.255
Katarina.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.425
Cat is animal.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.860
Cat, dog.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.129
What I call Marta? Dog.
        I call you cat.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.530
-Meow.
        -(clears throat)

35:00.532 --> 35:02.966
Yeah, no, great,
   but can I get some sleep?

35:02.968 --> 35:04.734
One of us should sleep.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.770
I don't sleep.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.205
-Yeah.
        -This is very...

35:08.207 --> 35:10.040
-This is naughty.
             -Yeah.

35:10.042 --> 35:13.110
Mum!
 Can I please just go to sleep?

35:13.112 --> 35:15.112
Yes, you sleep.
        We talk morning.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.114
-You are clean, hmm?
   -This... Yeah, yeah, um...

35:17.116 --> 35:19.216
-Pillow. Pillow.
-Okay. Um, yeah, it's a pillow.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.750
-Head. Sleep.
      -Yeah, I am gonna...

35:20.752 --> 35:21.885
I'm good. (mutters)

35:21.887 --> 35:23.620
-Hmm.
       -KATE: Yeah, okay.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.455
(sighs) Okay.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.125
-Good night.
           -Naughty.

35:29.294 --> 35:30.794
(yawns)

35:32.798 --> 35:34.798
Oh, God.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.602
Mm.

36:02.127 --> 36:04.127
DR. ADDIS:
<i>So, uh, tell me about the diet.</i>

36:04.129 --> 36:05.762
-Keeping up with the fruit
     and veg? -Yeah, fine.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.265
She's eating rubbish
      when she is outside.

36:08.267 --> 36:11.701
When she's at home, she's
 eating my food, and it's good.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.870
I'm sure it is.
     Uh, what about sleep?

36:13.872 --> 36:15.472
-Yeah, it's all right.
       -She never sleeps.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.541
-Exercise?
   -Religiously. -Not at all.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.442
-Alcohol?
    -Every once in a while.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.044
Oh, she's drinking
        like the pirate.

36:21.046 --> 36:22.345
-You say you're okay.
          -KATE: Yep.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.548
And your mother says
the opposite. Who do I believe?

36:24.550 --> 36:26.016
-Me, obviously.
  -Me, the mother, of course.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.651
-All right, all right, listen.
        -(Petra scoffs)

36:27.653 --> 36:29.619
There's nothing
        conclusive here,

36:29.621 --> 36:32.289
but you, Kate, you've got to
    take care of your heart.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.723
You need to rest more,

36:33.725 --> 36:36.459
-eat better, drink less...
         <i> -Da. Da. Da.</i>

36:36.461 --> 36:39.162
-and stop being so angry.
      <i> -Da.</i> -(Kate groans)

36:39.164 --> 36:42.299
And you, Mrs. Andrich...
    you need to worry less.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.733
I not sleeping.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.236
Can you please give me
    something for sleeping?

36:46.238 --> 36:48.471
Mrs. Andrich, you've been given
      everything there is

36:48.473 --> 36:50.740
for sleep, anxiety,
    panic attacks, the lot.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.009
You have the best that
 modern medicine has to offer.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.178
-Then what can I do?
         -Join a club.

36:55.180 --> 36:57.214
Hmm? Talk to other people.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.748
Enjoy time with your friends.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.351
-All my friends were murdered.
          -Okay, fine.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.986
Thank you, Doctor. Thank you
     so much for your time.

37:02.988 --> 37:04.521
-But it's-it's true.
    -Let's go, Mum. Come on.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.722
-They took them.
-Mum, come on. Come on. I know.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.157
-Thank you. Um... -Come on,
    Mama, out we get. Sorry.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.592
-Sorry. Let's go. -Kate, we'll
  see you in a... in a month.

37:08.594 --> 37:09.826
-(speaking Serbo-Croatian)
      -See you next year.

37:09.828 --> 37:11.394
-There you go. All right.
     -I am coming. I come.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.729
-Get-get out the-- Right.
          -I'm coming.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.731
-Thank you. -(door closes)
     -(sighs) Bloody hell.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.247
(bell jingles)

37:30.249 --> 37:31.881
Can I help?

37:31.883 --> 37:33.250
No.

37:33.252 --> 37:35.285
I'm having a self-pity party.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.620
Ooh.

37:36.622 --> 37:38.688
Am I invited?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.690
Well, only if you promise
          to judge me.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.393
Oh, you definitely don't need
      any help doing that.

37:43.395 --> 37:45.395
Or maybe you do.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.364
I'm very good at tidying up.

37:47.366 --> 37:48.932
(clears throat)

37:50.902 --> 37:52.469
Yes.

38:10.155 --> 38:11.621
-These expensive?
          -(rattling)

38:11.623 --> 38:13.423
(Kate stammers)

38:13.425 --> 38:16.293
Idiot. Follow me.

38:17.262 --> 38:18.662
Ah.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.430
(singsongy):
            Tra-la.

38:20.432 --> 38:23.900
All right, Mr. Muscle, you can
  get to refreshing that tree.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.402
-This one?
             -Yeah.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.207
Going home
     always makes me crazy.

38:32.244 --> 38:33.276
How was it?

38:33.278 --> 38:34.844
Hell. Mum sung me to sleep.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.913
You're the only person

38:36.915 --> 38:39.316
who can make being sung to
sleep sound like waterboarding.

38:39.318 --> 38:42.252
Well, it's not that dissimilar.

38:42.254 --> 38:43.853
(laughing):
     These, um, folk songs

38:43.855 --> 38:45.922
make you want
     to string yourself up.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.991
Is that where you get
       your singing from?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.794
Yeah, she was a singer
   back in, um, the homeland.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.295
Where was that?

38:52.297 --> 38:54.831
Former Yugoslavia.
       We had to escape.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.033
-'Cause of the war?
           -Exactly.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.703
Mm. Must have been hard.

38:59.705 --> 39:01.938
Yeah. Dad was a lawyer.

39:01.940 --> 39:05.208
Um, and now he stays away
  from home as much as he can

39:05.210 --> 39:07.043
because he'd rather be dead.
           (chuckles)

39:07.045 --> 39:08.478
Except he's a minicab driver,

39:08.480 --> 39:11.181
which is sort of
        the same thing.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.216
Can he not practice here?

39:13.218 --> 39:14.351
No, he couldn't afford
          to retrain,

39:14.353 --> 39:16.486
so he's out all the time.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.288
Also to avoid my mother,

39:18.290 --> 39:22.625
who's given to depression
 in much the same way as, um...

39:22.627 --> 39:24.661
What?
   You're looking at me like

39:24.663 --> 39:26.696
some sort of science experiment
       that's gone wrong.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.897
Sorry.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.400
-No, I'm interested.
             -Huh.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.168
I mean, your mother--
     when was the last time

39:32.170 --> 39:33.336
you saw her
      not being depressed?

39:33.338 --> 39:35.071
(chuckles)

39:35.073 --> 39:37.907
Ooh, I think
     when I got really ill.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.576
And she was happy about that?

39:39.578 --> 39:43.480
No, but she was happy
      about the attention.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.382
I mean,
   I got a lot of attention,

39:45.384 --> 39:47.484
but I was unconscious.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.052
She got more.

39:49.054 --> 39:53.056
Just the doctors,
the nurses, the hospital staff.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.891
Drama. God, she loved it.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.993
She sort of flowered
       under it like a...

39:56.995 --> 39:58.995
like a late blossoming
         or something.

39:58.997 --> 40:02.232
Anyway, when I got better,
       it all went away,

40:02.234 --> 40:04.501
and she's just never
      been the same since.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.569
Well, maybe she enjoyed
      being needed again.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.938
Oh, trust you to come up
 with something understanding.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.875
-That is truly horrific.
        -(Kate chuckles)

40:11.877 --> 40:13.710
I mean, who buys this stuff?

40:13.712 --> 40:16.880
Santa. She's Chinese,
      so she's, you know,

40:16.882 --> 40:20.250
got access to some
     really freaky outlets.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.286
She just loves Christmas
    more than anything else.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.523
-More than taste or sanity.
         -Yes, exactly.

40:26.525 --> 40:29.592
And that isn't even
  the nastiest thing we sell.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.727
Inconceivable.

40:30.729 --> 40:32.195
Hang on.

40:34.399 --> 40:37.567
-¶ Dun, dun, dun! ¶
              -Oh!

40:37.569 --> 40:39.302
-Check it out.
          -What is it?

40:39.304 --> 40:41.738
-Is that donkey actually
  smiling at me? -Yeah. Yeah.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.306
And that baby
    has a full set of teeth.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.942
-Oof. -I sold four of these
   last week. I'm that good.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.544
(techno version
  of "Last Christmas" playing)

40:47.546 --> 40:49.579
Oh, it's a...
   oh, it's a techno manger.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.080
-Yeah.
     -Oh, yeah, yeah. Cool.

40:51.082 --> 40:52.816
-It's a disco nativity scene.
          -(laughing)

40:52.818 --> 40:54.784
Is that really
   a good nutritional choice?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.286
Oh, God, don't you start.

40:56.288 --> 40:58.221
Where are you?

40:58.223 --> 40:59.489
Look up.

41:01.393 --> 41:03.126
Yeah.

41:03.128 --> 41:05.161
Yeah, after you...
   what you've been through,

41:05.163 --> 41:07.931
I mean, shouldn't you be eating
  quinoa or kale or something?

41:07.933 --> 41:10.834
Yeah, but this
     admittedly rank burger

41:10.836 --> 41:12.902
is all part of my grand plan

41:12.904 --> 41:15.638
to become a famous singer
   and die like Kurt Cobain,

41:15.640 --> 41:18.341
Amy Winehouse and all the rest
       at the age of 27.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.578
-How old are you?
              -45.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.112
Oh. Good to have dreams.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.280
Not really. I'm 26.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.815
Oh, thank God.
      You still have time.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.150
(chuckles)

41:27.152 --> 41:29.452
-Come on. Get rid of that.
        -Where...? Wait.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.488
Let's go.
  I've got a surprise for you.

41:33.992 --> 41:37.494
-Ugh, really? (laughs)
          -Mm, yummy!

41:38.930 --> 41:40.363
There's something wrong
       with me, you know.

41:40.365 --> 41:41.931
-I'm too trusting.
         -(Tom scoffs)

41:41.933 --> 41:44.133
Down a dark alley again
   with a complete stranger.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.335
I don't even...
       I mean, seriously,

41:45.337 --> 41:48.071
-where are you... (chuckles)
    -Pop yourself over here.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.441
-All right, then.
         -Need a hand?

41:51.443 --> 41:53.009
No.

41:53.011 --> 41:54.677
-(grunting): Oh, Christ.
              -Oh.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.447
-(groans) Oh, my God.
   -Oh! That looked painful.

41:57.449 --> 41:59.516
-Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine!
    -Ah, you... you're fine.

41:59.518 --> 42:01.050
That was like poetry in motion.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.318
-Piss off.
           -Come on.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.021
Sure. Never wanted kids anyway.
            (grunts)

42:05.023 --> 42:06.890
(Kate groaning)

42:06.892 --> 42:08.391
Okay.

42:08.393 --> 42:09.893
Now I am intrigued.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.794
-How are you gonna dispose
      of my body? -Shh...

42:11.796 --> 42:14.631
-Shh!
       -I... am shh-ing.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.867
(imitating Sean Connery):
           Stay back.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.203
Are you seriously doing
    a James Bond impression?

42:20.205 --> 42:22.639
Now is not the time
      for unpleasantness.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.909
Now is the time... for romance!

42:25.911 --> 42:28.378
("Praying for Time"
   by George Michael playing)

42:34.486 --> 42:36.753
You like?

42:36.755 --> 42:38.588
I like, yeah.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.056
Let's go.

42:42.060 --> 42:46.162
¶ These are the days
       of the open hand ¶

42:46.164 --> 42:49.599
¶ They will not be the last ¶

42:49.601 --> 42:51.935
¶ Look around now ¶

42:51.937 --> 42:56.606
¶ These are the days of
 the beggars and the choosers ¶

42:56.608 --> 43:00.677
¶ This is the year
      of the hungry man ¶

43:00.679 --> 43:04.380
¶ Whose place is in the past ¶

43:04.382 --> 43:08.184
¶ Hand in hand with ignorance ¶

43:08.186 --> 43:12.889
¶ And legitimate excuses ¶

43:12.891 --> 43:16.125
¶ The rich declare
       themselves poor ¶

43:16.127 --> 43:19.529
¶ And most of us are not sure ¶

43:19.531 --> 43:21.297
¶ If we have too much ¶

43:21.299 --> 43:23.700
¶ But we'll take our chances ¶

43:23.702 --> 43:26.903
¶ 'Cause God's stopped
        keeping score ¶

43:26.905 --> 43:30.773
¶ I guess somewhere
        along the way ¶

43:30.775 --> 43:35.445
¶ He must have let us
       all out to play ¶

43:35.447 --> 43:39.582
¶ Turned his back,
    and all God's children ¶

43:39.584 --> 43:42.452
¶ Crept out the back door ¶

43:43.955 --> 43:47.256
¶ Well, maybe
       we should all be ¶

43:47.258 --> 43:49.425
¶ Praying for time... ¶

43:49.427 --> 43:51.561
-Oi!
     -Oh, sorry! -Oh, crap.

43:51.563 --> 43:53.763
-You can't be in here!
     -Yeah, no. -Sorry, no.

43:53.765 --> 43:55.231
-We're-we're leaving.
  -Absolutely, we're leaving.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.299
-Sorry... (screams)
             -Whoa!

43:56.301 --> 43:57.767
-(Kate squeals)
           -TOM: Oh!

43:57.769 --> 43:59.969
(both laugh, whooping)

43:59.971 --> 44:01.771
-(groans) Ow!
        -(Tom chuckling)

44:01.773 --> 44:03.106
KATE:
     I'm coming. I'm com...

44:03.108 --> 44:05.575
(both chuckle and sigh)

44:05.577 --> 44:09.078
I would, uh... I'd call that
       a successful date.

44:09.080 --> 44:12.615
Fun, free, illegal, romantic.

44:12.617 --> 44:14.450
-And practical, too.
    Don't forget. -(laughs)

44:14.452 --> 44:15.652
Why practical?

44:15.654 --> 44:16.786
Your audition.

44:16.788 --> 44:18.521
-Remember?
             -Yes.

44:18.523 --> 44:21.591
I'd like to think that I played
a part in your rise to stardom.

44:21.593 --> 44:23.660
-(laughs) -Remember me
    when you're at the top.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.596
No chance. Tom who?

44:26.598 --> 44:28.398
Actually, Tom who?

44:29.534 --> 44:31.034
Webster.

44:31.036 --> 44:32.535
Huh.

44:32.537 --> 44:34.404
You look like a Webster.

44:36.441 --> 44:38.274
Now what?

44:39.310 --> 44:41.344
Now I've got to go to work.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.981
Um...

44:44.983 --> 44:46.683
You knew.

44:46.685 --> 44:49.619
-I work nights.
             -Yes.

44:49.621 --> 44:51.654
I knew.

44:51.656 --> 44:54.524
It's night. Cool. Okay.

44:54.526 --> 44:55.858
How you gonna get home?

44:55.860 --> 44:58.628
-Oh, the bus.
         -(Tom grunts)

44:58.630 --> 45:00.997
You gonna be okay?

45:00.999 --> 45:03.833
As okay as I'll ever be
          on the bus.

45:03.835 --> 45:05.034
Okay, then.

45:05.036 --> 45:06.803
I'll come find you at the shop.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.505
(chuckling): I'm not sure
    if I've still got a job.

45:09.507 --> 45:11.340
Santa kind of hates me.

45:11.342 --> 45:13.643
Maybe you should do
   something nice for Santa.

45:13.645 --> 45:15.244
¶ ¶

45:15.246 --> 45:16.879
Good luck.

45:20.919 --> 45:22.919
Look up.

45:25.356 --> 45:27.657
-(chuckles softly)
         -(horn honks)

45:27.659 --> 45:29.025
-(brakes squealing)
        -(horn honking)

45:29.027 --> 45:30.560
Christ.

45:32.163 --> 45:33.563
So, this is our selection

45:33.565 --> 45:35.331
-of nutcrackers.
    -Working hard over here.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.866
-Mm-hmm.
              -Mm.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.401
You know, from the ballet?

45:38.403 --> 45:39.669
-Tchaikovsky?
          -WOMAN: Ah.

45:39.671 --> 45:41.003
MAN:
  Which kind of music is this?

45:41.005 --> 45:42.739
-I want something to be...
   -WOMAN: Listen. Be quiet.

45:42.741 --> 45:43.940
SANTA:
    This is Christmas music.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.808
You must enjoy it.

45:52.684 --> 45:54.083
SANTA:
   This is a big nutcracker.

45:54.085 --> 45:56.085
MAN:
 Can my nuts fit inside there?

45:56.087 --> 45:57.787
SANTA: Uh, depends on
     how big are your nuts.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.889
WOMAN: But it's too big.
  We can't take that with us.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.859
Santa, um, I think
  I can take over from there.

46:02.861 --> 46:05.561
Because, um, there's also
   someone here, a gentleman,

46:05.563 --> 46:07.897
who requires
   your specific assistance.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.265
SANTA:
   Yes, you can have a look.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.433
Think about it.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.734
KATE:
     I'm gonna show you to

46:11.736 --> 46:13.236
the even bigger nutcrackers
       around the corner.

46:13.238 --> 46:14.937
MAN:
      There's bigger nuts?

46:14.939 --> 46:17.774
-KATE: For your big nuts.
     Here we are. -MAN: Oh.

46:19.144 --> 46:21.844
Have you come back
        for the gibbon?

46:23.081 --> 46:26.149
Of all the things in my life,

46:26.151 --> 46:30.286
this is my best thing.

46:30.288 --> 46:31.888
What is?

46:31.890 --> 46:33.790
Christmas.

46:35.593 --> 46:36.993
Really?

46:36.995 --> 46:38.961
This is why I love
        to come in here.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.663
I also love it.

46:40.665 --> 46:43.366
That is why I have this shop.

46:44.569 --> 46:46.169
Oh, wow.

46:46.171 --> 46:48.571
(chuckles softly)

46:48.573 --> 46:52.809
¶ Have a holly jolly
          Christmas ¶

46:52.811 --> 46:56.179
¶ And in case you didn't hear ¶

46:56.181 --> 46:57.680
¶ Oh, by golly ¶

46:57.682 --> 47:02.418
¶ Have a holly jolly Christmas
          this year. ¶

47:02.420 --> 47:04.086
(applause)

47:04.088 --> 47:06.189
Kate, that was lovely.
           Thank you.

47:06.191 --> 47:08.424
Wonderful.
  I can smell the commitment.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.293
Do you know we have people
         turn up here,

47:10.295 --> 47:11.761
never been
     on an ice rink before?

47:11.763 --> 47:13.996
(laughing):
    I just couldn't imagine.

47:13.998 --> 47:16.599
Do you know we had a woman
     turn up in a crop top?

47:16.601 --> 47:18.267
-In a crop top to audition.
       -Yeah, I remember.

47:18.269 --> 47:19.468
Do you remember her flip-flops?

47:19.470 --> 47:21.204
-Remember those? -Of course
    I remember. -I remember.

47:21.206 --> 47:22.672
CASTING DIRECTOR:
 Thank you. We'll be in touch.

47:22.674 --> 47:23.873
-DIRECTOR: Thank you so much.
          -Thank you.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.308
Thank you. Thank you.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.343
I think she'd be good
for the horse. Don't you think?

47:27.345 --> 47:28.711
-DIRECTOR: No, we can...
         -KATE: Oh, no!

47:30.648 --> 47:33.049
-DIRECTOR: Are you all right?
      -I, uh... I did that

47:33.051 --> 47:36.152
just in case you thought
       I was too perfect.

47:36.154 --> 47:37.720
KATE:
             Okay.

47:38.790 --> 47:39.956
Okay.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.657
DIRECTOR: Thank goodness
   for a heavy woolen tight.

47:41.659 --> 47:43.626
KATE:
             Idiot.

47:43.628 --> 47:44.894
Skaters fall. It's fine.

47:44.896 --> 47:46.395
MAN:
      ...at the same time.

47:46.397 --> 47:48.130
Also, nobody's clapping.
    (continues indistinctly)

47:48.132 --> 47:49.932
-(scattered applause)
     -(indistinct chatter)

47:55.840 --> 47:57.907
-(applause)
       -(crowd murmuring)

48:01.512 --> 48:04.046
So, it went well,
        and I am happy.

48:04.048 --> 48:05.848
Good.

48:05.850 --> 48:07.583
All set for your date?

48:07.585 --> 48:08.684
Good Lord.

48:08.686 --> 48:09.986
(clears throat)

48:11.756 --> 48:12.755
Okay.

48:12.757 --> 48:14.824
-Right, um...
             -What?

48:14.826 --> 48:16.826
We're just gonna need
       to dial this down.

48:16.828 --> 48:18.194
I'm making an effort.

48:18.196 --> 48:19.595
He's gonna think he's wandered

48:19.597 --> 48:21.764
into the llama enclosure.
             Close.

48:21.766 --> 48:22.999
(sighs)

48:23.001 --> 48:24.333
Ow.

48:24.335 --> 48:25.902
KATE:
            Mm-hmm.

48:25.904 --> 48:27.603
-Ow.
           -Oh, yeah.

48:27.605 --> 48:28.871
Serves you right.

48:28.873 --> 48:30.740
So I defer to the Swiper queen.

48:30.742 --> 48:32.642
-Blot.
            -Mm, mm.

48:34.445 --> 48:36.345
There we are.

48:36.347 --> 48:39.448
So, where is See-Through
          taking you?

48:39.450 --> 48:41.684
-I have no idea.
       -What's his name?

48:41.686 --> 48:43.019
I can't pronounce it.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.021
Lots of glottal stops.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.023
"Yogh..." (hawking)

48:47.025 --> 48:48.524
Oh, when I try to say it,

48:48.526 --> 48:50.626
I sound like a cat
        with a fur ball.

48:50.628 --> 48:53.062
So I've decided
       to call him "Boy."

48:53.064 --> 48:55.731
Mm. Well, at least your name's
      easier to pronounce.

48:55.733 --> 48:57.667
What? Huang Qing Shin?

48:59.203 --> 49:01.103
You're not really called Santa?

49:01.105 --> 49:02.738
Of course not, idiot.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.074
-I chose it for the shop.
            -Really?

49:05.076 --> 49:07.209
Yeah, when I worked
        at the pet shop,

49:07.211 --> 49:08.577
I called myself Kitty.

49:08.579 --> 49:09.912
-No.
            -Mm-hmm.

49:09.914 --> 49:14.083
And at the health food shop,
          I was Miso.

49:14.085 --> 49:16.452
-No, no.
       -Mm-hmm. Yes, yes.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.888
Guess what it was in the bakery
      on the Edgware Road.

49:18.890 --> 49:20.256
Uh, Crumpet?

49:20.258 --> 49:22.258
-Sausage Roll?
            -Muffin.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.926
-(laughs): Muffin?
       -"Muff" for short.

49:23.928 --> 49:25.227
Excellent.

49:25.229 --> 49:27.730
More important is:
         how do I look?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.232
Really hot.

49:30.234 --> 49:31.634
(giggles)

49:31.636 --> 49:34.170
Did you just giggle
          like a girl?

49:34.172 --> 49:35.471
I am a girl.

49:35.473 --> 49:36.939
-Not really.
         -Oh, shut up.

49:36.941 --> 49:39.342
And where's this man of yours?

49:39.344 --> 49:41.344
The one you keep
   looking out the window for

49:41.346 --> 49:42.979
instead of working.

49:42.981 --> 49:44.347
Oh, he's just... I don't know.

49:44.349 --> 49:45.748
He hasn't got a phone.

49:45.750 --> 49:48.117
-Oh. He's wise.
              -Mm.

49:48.119 --> 49:50.853
-What is he doing with you?
           -Nothing.

49:50.855 --> 49:52.788
Mm.

49:52.790 --> 49:54.590
Don't worry, elf.

49:54.592 --> 49:56.425
He'll turn up.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.598
(sighs)

50:02.600 --> 50:04.166
(man grunts)

50:04.168 --> 50:05.368
(indistinct conversation)

50:05.370 --> 50:06.936
We woke him up.

50:06.938 --> 50:09.038
(conversation continues
         indistinctly)

50:12.944 --> 50:14.910
¶ ¶

50:17.382 --> 50:19.281
(bicycle bell dings)

50:39.871 --> 50:42.038
(quiet chatter)

50:43.474 --> 50:45.708
Hi. Excuse me.
 I'm just looking for someone.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.343
-Who's that, then?
           -Uh, Tom.

50:47.345 --> 50:50.646
Ta-ta-ta. Would you like
       a biscuit, Arthur?

50:50.648 --> 50:52.048
Have you got a bourbon,
           Danny boy?

50:52.050 --> 50:55.051
No, but can I press you
      to a custard cream?

50:55.053 --> 50:56.886
Ooh.
     I wish somebody would.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.187
-Tom, did you say?
          -KATE: Yeah.

50:58.189 --> 50:59.722
Tom. Um, h-he's tall...

50:59.724 --> 51:01.891
-Tom!
      -(people murmuring)

51:01.893 --> 51:04.260
Take your pick, young lady.

51:04.262 --> 51:07.730
Right. Yeah, see, the thing is,
       he's not homeless.

51:07.732 --> 51:09.765
Well, what's he
       doing here, then?

51:09.767 --> 51:12.068
Um, well, he works here.

51:12.070 --> 51:13.269
-Nights, I think.
              -Ah.

51:13.271 --> 51:14.537
Well, I don't see
       the night lot, me.

51:14.539 --> 51:16.439
-He must be a volunteer.
        -Yes. That's...

51:16.441 --> 51:18.274
MAN:
   Oi, Danny! Give us a hand?

51:18.276 --> 51:20.943
Speaking of which,
  be a pet and serve the teas

51:20.945 --> 51:22.778
while I get the soup sorted.

51:22.780 --> 51:24.080
And only
    two biscuits each, mind.

51:24.082 --> 51:25.281
I'm not made
      of bloody biscuits.

51:25.283 --> 51:26.749
And watch this one,

51:26.751 --> 51:28.851
'cause last week,
     he filled his pockets.

51:28.853 --> 51:30.519
Come on, then! Tea's up!

51:30.521 --> 51:32.521
Okay.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.123
I'm Tom.

51:34.125 --> 51:36.192
-Ex-grenadier. Will I do?
         -Lovely. Um...

51:36.194 --> 51:38.360
KATE:
 Do you know, actually, it's...

51:38.362 --> 51:39.462
a whole different Tom.

51:39.464 --> 51:41.030
But would you like a biscuit?

51:41.032 --> 51:43.432
I could... make some tea.

51:44.469 --> 51:45.968
ARTHUR:
      Just the two, then?

51:45.970 --> 51:47.837
Just...

51:52.944 --> 51:55.177
(weakly):
   Anyone like a cup of tea?

51:56.380 --> 51:58.414
Try and keep it down to...
            Oi, oi.

51:58.416 --> 52:00.082
Nice of you to volunteer.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.650
Well, I-I didn't.
      I was press-ganged.

52:01.652 --> 52:03.486
You want to help us
         with the soup?

52:03.488 --> 52:05.154
KATE:
     No. Thank you, but no.

52:05.156 --> 52:07.923
If Tom Webster does come in,
    could you just tell him

52:07.925 --> 52:09.658
that Kate needs to talk to him?

52:09.660 --> 52:11.727
-Not "needs."
         -"Would like"?

52:11.729 --> 52:14.830
Yeah. Yeah.

52:14.832 --> 52:17.066
-Got it. -Yeah, 'cause
    he doesn't have a phone.

52:17.068 --> 52:18.501
Would you like a bowl of soup?
       You've earned it.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.970
No, I'm good. Thanks.

52:22.773 --> 52:25.141
Dan, what do you reckon?

52:25.143 --> 52:27.576
(sighs)
   Bit up herself, I thought.

52:27.578 --> 52:30.446
(train passing in distance)

52:30.448 --> 52:32.248
-IVAN: Yeah. -PETRA:
   And-and she's very happy.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.083
-She was. -You show...
      I show you picture.

52:34.085 --> 52:36.085
-MARTA: You showed me, Mum.
  -A little beautiful picture.

52:36.087 --> 52:37.353
-You showed me last time.
       -Easy, easy, easy.

52:37.355 --> 52:38.420
-And she's a...
             -Hey.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.489
-Ah! Oh, at last.
    -Hey. Uh, there she is.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.358
-PETRA: Ah. Hey, at last.
          -(chuckles)

52:42.360 --> 52:43.659
-I was so worry.
 -(Ivan speaks Serbo-Croatian)

52:43.661 --> 52:45.294
Where you are, huh?

52:45.296 --> 52:47.830
-Huh? -Um, I was volunteering
     at a homeless shelter.

52:47.832 --> 52:49.999
-Uh, what it mean?
    -It means helping, Mum.

52:50.001 --> 52:51.433
-You? Helping?
             -Yes.

52:51.435 --> 52:53.002
-Ha, yeah. Sure you were.
       -IVAN: Oh, really?

52:53.004 --> 52:55.004
And I just rescued an orphan
      from a burning car.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.205
(clears throat)

52:56.207 --> 52:57.673
Did I miss something?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.141
Oh, wow.

52:59.143 --> 53:00.676
<i> Oh, jebote, Marta. </i>
           I'm sorry.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.545
The dinner to celebrate
        your promotion.

53:02.547 --> 53:03.812
Second promotion.

53:03.814 --> 53:04.980
-KATE (whispers): Second.
      -Great achievement.

53:04.982 --> 53:06.215
Thank you, Dad.

53:06.217 --> 53:07.983
Now you are here,
      we have krem torta.

53:07.985 --> 53:09.351
-KATE: I'm sorry.
        -(Ivan mutters)

53:09.353 --> 53:10.553
Seriously, Marta, I am sorry.

53:10.555 --> 53:12.321
It doesn't matter.

53:12.323 --> 53:14.723
-Oh, thanks a lot, Mum.
        -Your favorite.

53:14.725 --> 53:16.659
-I'm all right, actually.
   -MARTA: What? So, is there

53:16.661 --> 53:18.661
something wrong
  with your favorite cake now?

53:18.663 --> 53:20.496
No. I'm just not hungry.

53:20.498 --> 53:21.564
Well, I'm...

53:21.566 --> 53:23.199
There's always something,
          isn't there?

53:23.201 --> 53:25.234
Like, you're hungry,
       you're not hungry.

53:25.236 --> 53:26.902
You're tired,
      you're overexcited.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.305
-You've got a tummy ache.
            -Give...

53:29.307 --> 53:30.539
(groans)

53:30.541 --> 53:32.408
Gosh, you're so tiresome,
           Katarina.

53:32.410 --> 53:33.742
(groans)
  <i> Nabijem te na kurac, Marta.</i>

53:33.744 --> 53:34.910
It's "Kate."

53:34.912 --> 53:36.245
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
          -(laughing)

53:36.247 --> 53:38.047
You taught her
      this terrible word?

53:38.049 --> 53:39.548
-Of course not.
     -Do you actually even

53:39.550 --> 53:41.183
know what
 <i> "nabijem te na kurac"</i> means?

53:41.185 --> 53:42.318
Uh, yeah, I actually do.

53:42.320 --> 53:44.820
It means,
 "I will nail you to my dick."

53:44.822 --> 53:46.922
-Yeah, I knew that.
     -Not "dick." "Penis."

53:46.924 --> 53:48.924
Well, "dick" means "penis."

53:48.926 --> 53:51.393
-"Dick" means "penis"?
  -"Dick" means "penis." Yeah.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.829
-No, Dick is our neighbor.
    -It also means "penis."

53:53.831 --> 53:56.065
Dick, our-our neighbor,
       is called "penis"?

53:56.067 --> 53:57.900
Dick is penis. Penis is dick.
     That's the same word.

53:57.902 --> 53:59.501
-Would you stop saying "dick"
   and "penis"? -It's just...

53:59.503 --> 54:02.238
-I'm trying to explain.
  -Uh, uh, whatever, you know.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.673
-I'm just so bored of your
 shit. -Marta, stop. She's ill.

54:04.675 --> 54:07.610
-She's not ill anymore, Mum.
-She is not ill anymore, Petra.

54:07.612 --> 54:08.711
And what you know?

54:08.713 --> 54:10.179
What you know anything
       about this family?

54:10.181 --> 54:11.580
You're never here.

54:11.582 --> 54:12.715
I'm not ill anymore, all right?

54:12.717 --> 54:14.583
No, she is still ill--
        why is she still

54:14.585 --> 54:15.951
working in silly Christmas shop

54:15.953 --> 54:18.220
when she was always
       the b-bright one?

54:18.222 --> 54:19.555
<i> Nabijem te na kurac.</i>

54:19.557 --> 54:20.789
(hisses)

54:20.791 --> 54:22.258
You are very hard worker.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.460
Wha... Oh, right, yeah,
    well, well, apparently,

54:24.462 --> 54:26.395
with my pathetic,
     inferior little brain.

54:26.397 --> 54:31.033
Now she's wasting her life,
 which only a miracle save her.

54:31.035 --> 54:32.401
Wasting my life. Thanks, Mum.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.203
And you have job you dream of.

54:34.205 --> 54:37.239
Yeah, except that I didn't
  dream of it, did I? You did.

54:37.241 --> 54:40.042
You know, Dad can't be
 a lawyer here, so I had to be.

54:40.044 --> 54:41.977
No matter what I might have
     actually wanted to do.

54:41.979 --> 54:43.479
Yeah, would you rather
         drive minicab?

54:43.481 --> 54:46.048
Look what it done to him.
  He look thousand years old.

54:46.050 --> 54:47.283
Oh, thanks.

54:47.285 --> 54:48.951
<i> -Nabijem i tebe na kurac. </i>
       -MARTA: And you...

54:48.953 --> 54:50.719
y-you sit there, and you think
   it's absolutely acceptable

54:50.721 --> 54:52.121
to say that she's cleverer
            than me.

54:52.123 --> 54:54.323
And I'm expected to swallow it
  just because she's been ill.

54:54.325 --> 54:55.658
-Marta, calm down.
      -No, don't you dare

54:55.660 --> 54:57.660
-tell me to calm down,
      all right? -(groans)

54:57.662 --> 55:00.929
-Marta. -All right,
 you don't care about anything,

55:00.931 --> 55:03.465
Katarina, or Kate,
 or whatever your name is now,

55:03.467 --> 55:05.134
because you're ashamed
        of who you are.

55:05.136 --> 55:06.969
Oh, I'm ashamed of who I am?

55:06.971 --> 55:08.270
-(scoffs)
        -What about you?

55:08.272 --> 55:09.605
Where's Alba?

55:09.607 --> 55:11.106
(quietly):
            Shut up.

55:11.108 --> 55:14.343
On your big celebration dinner,
   where is your girlfriend?

55:14.345 --> 55:16.011
PETRA:
             Alba?

55:16.013 --> 55:18.914
Alba is...
   Alba is Marta's flatmate.

55:18.916 --> 55:20.516
KATE: Yeah, and that's how
     it's always gonna be.

55:20.518 --> 55:22.484
I bet she's really happy
          about that.

55:23.821 --> 55:24.820
What she say?

55:26.590 --> 55:28.691
Oh, God,
    you're a piece of work.

55:28.693 --> 55:31.427
(Ivan speaking Serbo-Croatian)

55:32.496 --> 55:34.430
Marta.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.198
-Marta.
            -Marta.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.268
Eh.

55:39.270 --> 55:41.437
Eat. You look like skeleton.

55:44.542 --> 55:47.176
I got to go.

55:47.178 --> 55:48.577
Goodbye, Mum.

55:50.281 --> 55:52.715
(takes deep breath)

55:52.717 --> 55:54.950
I will nail you to my dick.

-Hey.
     -(bicycle bell dings)

56:46.203 --> 56:47.603
What are you doing out so late?

56:47.605 --> 56:48.871
Well, where have you been?

56:48.873 --> 56:50.205
-What's up?
         -"What's up?"

56:50.207 --> 56:52.441
Me not being able
   to find you is what's up.

56:52.443 --> 56:55.277
You just... you've been
 disappearing for days on end.

56:55.279 --> 56:57.546
-Two days. -And I've been
      trying to find you.

56:57.548 --> 56:59.681
So take your stupid phone
  out of your stupid cupboard

56:59.683 --> 57:01.417
and contact me, all right?
           'Cause...

57:01.419 --> 57:03.552
because I've just been
         really stupid.

57:03.554 --> 57:06.789
I've been
     really, really stupid.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.724
I mean, it's a bit
      of a stretch, but...

57:08.726 --> 57:10.259
have you had a couple drinks?

57:10.261 --> 57:12.628
Oh, bugger off
  with your cleanly manliness.

57:12.630 --> 57:14.763
All right?
 Just... just go back to work.

57:14.765 --> 57:16.198
Leave me alone.

57:16.200 --> 57:18.700
No, I've just come back
    from helping the needy.

57:18.702 --> 57:19.968
Great.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.070
You know, just a bit
         of psych work.

57:22.072 --> 57:23.238
I work with
    the severely distressed.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.773
You know,
   when they get off on one.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.442
-Ah.
           -In fact,

57:26.444 --> 57:28.811
you're severely distressed
 and have just gone off on one,

57:28.813 --> 57:30.979
so I'm glad that we bumped
        into each other.

57:33.617 --> 57:36.351
Shall we go get my phone
      from that cupboard?

57:37.888 --> 57:39.521
Okay.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.959
Let's go.

57:43.961 --> 57:45.994
Where are you taking me?

57:47.465 --> 57:49.298
Home.

57:52.102 --> 57:54.069
¶ ¶

57:57.842 --> 57:59.875
-It's down here.
             -Yeah.

¶ ¶

58:23.467 --> 58:24.867
Come on in.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.675
KATE:
            Uh, wow.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.177
You weren't kidding.

58:35.179 --> 58:36.979
Place is so tidy.

58:36.981 --> 58:38.947
-Come take a seat.
          -No. Uh, no.

58:38.949 --> 58:41.116
I can't. I'll crease something
   or just spontaneously wee.

58:41.118 --> 58:44.686
I'm gonna... sit on the floor.

58:44.688 --> 58:45.888
There's plenty of seats.

58:47.858 --> 58:49.124
Nice landing.

58:51.195 --> 58:53.128
You're not yourself.

58:53.130 --> 58:54.530
No?

58:54.532 --> 58:55.864
Maybe I'm wrong.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.533
Wrong about what?

58:57.535 --> 59:00.102
Maybe this is more you
         than anything.

59:06.510 --> 59:07.910
I'm a mess.

59:09.046 --> 59:10.579
Kind of.

59:11.582 --> 59:13.615
In here.

59:20.057 --> 59:24.793
When I was ill,
     it was a heart thing.

59:25.996 --> 59:27.930
Right.

59:28.999 --> 59:30.699
I had a heart transplant.

59:30.701 --> 59:33.335
I don't tell people,
     'cause they get weird,

59:33.337 --> 59:35.671
but I don't think
       you'll get weird.

59:36.707 --> 59:38.173
No.

59:40.878 --> 59:42.678
¶ ¶

59:51.388 --> 59:53.288
Is this okay?

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:15.644
They took out my heart.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:20.115
They took it and threw it away.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.218
And I... and I don't know
      what they put back,

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:28.724
but it felt weird and different
       and strange and...

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:31.059
and like I'd lost
     my most special part.

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:37.232
And they kept telling me
    I was lucky to be alive.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:40.636
But I didn't feel alive.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.671
I just felt half dead.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:55.417
Come here.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.255
(Kate grunts softly)

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.627
I was supposed to be special.

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:07.963
I didn't ask to be, but...

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:09.965
they made me feel special
        when I was ill.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.167
And then I was special
       when I nearly died

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:15.437
and had a transplant, but...

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:19.441
then they just expected me to
be normal and get on with life.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:22.144
There's no such thing
           as normal.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:24.279
It's a stupid word.

01:01:24.281 --> 01:01:26.281
Does a lot of damage.

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:29.451
Nothing feels right.

01:01:32.790 --> 01:01:36.224
You're the only person

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:39.061
that makes me feel, like,
        I don't know...

01:01:41.832 --> 01:01:44.299
...solid.

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.935
Like I exist.

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.306
I'm a part-time cycle courier

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.874
who doesn't even have a phone.

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:54.476
-I know.
        -(Tom chuckles)

01:01:54.478 --> 01:01:57.012
It's pretty sad.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:59.247
And I could sing before.

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.083
Turns out...

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.552
I can't do anything.

01:02:05.689 --> 01:02:08.223
I think the whole special...

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.425
being-special thing
         is overrated.

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:16.098
I think just to be
     a human being is hard.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.100
You know, really hard.

01:02:18.102 --> 01:02:20.335
You seem to manage all right.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:23.739
One thing someone said to me
           helped me.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:28.744
"Every little action
       of the common day

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:32.681
makes or unmakes character."

01:02:32.683 --> 01:02:37.119
It just means that you're built
     of everything you do.

01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:40.322
And that's okay.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.896
Who am I?

01:02:47.898 --> 01:02:50.866
-I don't know.
          -(laughing)

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.702
What's all this
     "me" business anyway?

01:02:53.704 --> 01:02:56.538
Hmm? What's wrong with...

01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.741
not knowing, you know,
      being inconsistent?

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:01.743
Just uncertain.

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:03.945
Why do you have to be anything?

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.387
Tom.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:14.189
Yeah?

01:03:16.894 --> 01:03:19.594
(whispers):
        Can we lie down?

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.130
Absolutely.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:23.899
-Come on.
             -Okay.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.467
Ooh. Gently does it.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.135

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:28.303

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:33.141
-Oh, the bed.
       -In the bed there.

       (stammers, scoffs)

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:42.751
Tom, I said... "we."

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.653
This is close enough for now.

01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:46.755
-We hardly know each other.
            -Wha...?

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:48.323

I just told you everything
   there is to know about me.

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:54.830
There is nothing more to know.

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:57.499
You've just poured out
  some very heavy-duty stuff.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.769
I think you should just
        sleep for a bit.

01:04:00.771 --> 01:04:02.771

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.006
-Like your mum?
            -No, no.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.008

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.191
Yeah, no, I...
     I know it's not much.

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:59.460
No, that's-that's an hour
    of pure heart and soul.

01:09:59.462 --> 01:10:01.496
You know,
 that's-that's riches, that is.

01:10:01.498 --> 01:10:03.164
-Thanks.
 -(chuckling): You're welcome.

01:10:03.166 --> 01:10:05.900
So, did you find
        your Tom, then?

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:07.135
Yeah.

01:10:07.137 --> 01:10:08.136
-Nice.
             -Yeah.

01:10:08.138 --> 01:10:09.170
Yeah, good for you.

01:10:09.172 --> 01:10:10.205
Thank you.

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:11.739
I'm just gonna leave that...

01:10:11.741 --> 01:10:13.007
right there.

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:15.210
Go nicely with your tea.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:16.744
-See you soon.
           -See you.

01:10:16.746 --> 01:10:18.246
-See you later.
          -Bye. -Bye.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:19.547
Don't even know
       where that's been.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:21.182
Dan, she doesn't have to help,
           you know.

01:10:21.184 --> 01:10:24.552
Listen, I've seen more of these
 little middle-class do-gooders

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.354
than you've had
       hot dinners, mate.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:27.855
Dan, I can't take
         your attitude.

01:10:27.857 --> 01:10:29.857
You're so negative.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:32.026
-Eat your mint.
           -(laughs)

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.895
So I didn't get
        that <i> Frozen</i> job.

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:35.597
-You're fired.
        -(Kate chuckles)

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:38.066
No, it's funny. I'm all right
      about it, actually.

01:10:38.068 --> 01:10:39.601
I'm not sure how I feel about

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:41.402
the whole auditioning thing
          in general.

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:43.104
I'm not sure
     it's that good for me.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:45.807
I might just give it a break.

01:10:47.177 --> 01:10:49.410
-What's wrong with you?
             -What?

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:51.346
That sounds like
    quite a healthy choice.

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:55.016
I haven't heard you make one
 of those in a very long time.

01:10:55.018 --> 01:10:56.351
Well, don't panic.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.519
I will go out
   and get shit-faced later.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:00.688
-(chuckles)
  -(door opens, bell jingles)

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:03.391
You're rehired.

01:11:03.393 --> 01:11:04.959
Ooh.

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:06.961
(Santa chuckles)

01:11:08.932 --> 01:11:10.265
Hello, Boy.

01:11:15.205 --> 01:11:17.472
It is a fermented
      mini cabbage hedge.

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:19.040
Blimey.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:20.241
Thank you.

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:22.243
It's beautiful.

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:23.811
It was my grandmother's.

01:11:23.813 --> 01:11:25.413
Oh, that's... lovely.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.648
That's very nice.

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.449
-Mm.

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:12.660
It's coming along nicely.

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:14.262
Yeah, that's 'cause of Arthur.

01:12:14.264 --> 01:12:16.998
-Bollocks it is.

Arthur, you-you do know that
  you don't have to audition.

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:26.307
-Well, I want to.
        -But you're in.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:28.309
Well, they'll think I'm a dick
          if I don't.

01:12:28.311 --> 01:12:29.677
-Fair enough.
      -Fair enough. Yeah.

      Thank you very much.

-Anyway...
      -So, how's your Tom?

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:28.369
Oh, well, I just wish I knew.

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.871
I haven't heard from him
            in days.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:31.172
He's disappeared again.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.907
It's a bit annoying,
         if I'm honest.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.509
He seems to be
      disappearing a lot.

01:13:34.511 --> 01:13:35.743
Is he a magician?

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.745
Well, you never know.
           (chuckles)

01:13:37.747 --> 01:13:40.548
Probably just scared
  of what he feels about you.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.216
You know, blokes and that.

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:45.019
Yeah.
       (inhales sharply)

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:46.888
-Well...
         -Bon appétit.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:48.723
Boom. Thank you.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:51.426

Hi.

01:14:43.413 --> 01:14:45.079
Hi.

01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:47.215
How've you been?

01:14:48.418 --> 01:14:50.218
Missing you.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.073
KATE:
              Mm.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.543
Mm.

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:17.445
Missing and kissing.

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:20.114
It's almost like
  we're having a relationship.

01:15:25.355 --> 01:15:28.022
Kate, there's something
     I've got to tell you.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:31.392
(sighing):
            Oh, God.

01:15:31.394 --> 01:15:34.362
The "there's something I've got
   to tell you" moment. Okay.

01:15:34.364 --> 01:15:36.030
Okay, let's go
       through the list.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.265
Um...

01:15:39.469 --> 01:15:42.036
You're gay?

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:45.206
-No, it's...
           -Married?

01:15:45.208 --> 01:15:47.608
-No, there's...
     -Uh, y-you need space?

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:50.244
You can't depend on me.

01:15:50.246 --> 01:15:52.480
I don't depend on you.

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:54.181
-Kate.
 -(stammers) Who said anything

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:55.983
about depending on anyone?

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.385
Listen, you said it yourself.

01:15:57.387 --> 01:15:59.086
I mean, you've been
      having a tough time

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.055
after all the trauma and...
   Look, I'm just worried...

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.557
Oh, so now it's my issue?

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.258
-No, you... -Look, if this
      is about commitment,

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.728
then you just need to say it,
          because I...

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.565
I can't do this anymore.

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.199
I look for you.

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:14.769
I look for you everywhere,
    and you're never there.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:18.606
And it makes me feel
    really bad about myself.

01:16:18.608 --> 01:16:21.242
And I'm finally getting better

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:23.811
and not feeling bad
         about myself.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.715
I'm not gonna heal my heart

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:31.452
and then give it to someone
   who is going to break it.

01:16:34.524 --> 01:16:36.357
I won't.

01:16:36.359 --> 01:16:38.292
No, Kate...

-Hello.
              -Hi.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:07.615
Alba?

01:18:07.617 --> 01:18:08.983
I'm Kate.

-Kate?
           -Katarina.

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:15.456
Yep. Just wondering
        if Marta was in.

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:17.158
She doesn't want
        to talk to you.

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.560
Yeah. Okay.

01:18:19.562 --> 01:18:21.562
I understand. Uh...

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:24.632
Could you just tell her
      that I'm very sorry?

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:28.569
That I will probably
    never stop being sorry.

01:18:28.571 --> 01:18:30.738
That I'm glad that she has you.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.841
I'm... and I'm-I'm sorry...

01:18:33.843 --> 01:18:35.876
that you and I
      never got the chance

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:37.745

Hi. Look, I'm sorry.
  I'm sorry about everything.

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:45.753
Please don't come here
        uninvited again.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:49.156
I wish Mum and Dad knew
        you were happy.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:51.826
It's none of their business.

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:53.861
All right, saying sorry
   doesn't change everything.

01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:55.296
You do understand that?

Look.

We weren't so lucky, you and I.

But I guess maybe we're all
 a bit damaged in this family.

Hi.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:47.948
Um, I was just...
      I was just wondering

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.483
if I could buy you a drink.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:50.885

Hmm, all right.

01:20:55.651 --> 01:20:58.152

-No.

Well, we... (sighs)
      He just won't commit

01:21:05.127 --> 01:21:07.228
because he thinks
   I depend on him too much,

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.796
and he basically said

01:21:08.798 --> 01:21:11.899
that I had made a career
     out of being a victim.

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:13.734
Hmm.

-He'll probably turn up.
            -Right.

Small but compact.
           It's neat.

-It's for sale?
        -Oh, yeah, yeah.

Freehold this one,
     not for rental. Yeah.

That's why he keeps it so tidy.

Oh, yeah. There's no room
       for clutter here.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:13.440

-I'll give it to him.
 Don't worry. -Give it to who?

01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:29.923
-Tom.
       -Who's that, then?

01:25:29.925 --> 01:25:32.993
Tom, who lives here
    but is selling the flat.

01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:34.228
No. No one lives here.

01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:35.262
It's-it's been empty
          for months.

01:25:35.264 --> 01:25:37.297
Maybe he was squatting.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:40.067
What?
   Was there a squatter here?

01:25:40.069 --> 01:25:42.436

             -Um...

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:44.771
Excuse my language.
     It's typical, that is.

01:37:01.583 --> 01:37:03.416
-Come on!
   -¶ To novo leto faljeno ¶

01:37:03.418 --> 01:37:05.118
¶ Sinek dete maleno ¶

01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:07.320

  ¶ Dobri ljudi sim doali... ¶

01:37:07.322 --> 01:37:09.455
("This Is How"
   by George Michael playing)

01:37:09.457 --> 01:37:12.992
¶ So you raise another glass ¶

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:17.764
¶ Looking for
      a different space ¶

01:37:17.766 --> 01:37:21.201
¶ I was leaning on the grass ¶

01:37:21.203 --> 01:37:24.804
¶ Dreaming of a sunnier day ¶

01:37:24.806 --> 01:37:26.139
(birds chirping)

01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:29.676
¶ Oh, it never came ¶

01:37:29.678 --> 01:37:34.147
¶ How could it have, baby? ¶

01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:38.017
¶ Where the present
        meets the past ¶

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:42.522
¶ It's hard to be more
       than we've seen ¶

01:37:42.524 --> 01:37:46.292
¶ Your daddy was a drinker ¶

01:37:46.294 --> 01:37:48.361
¶ He just kept drinking ¶

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:51.531
¶ Till the shit he was thinking
         sounded true ¶

01:37:51.533 --> 01:37:54.801
¶ Your mama was a thinker ¶

01:37:54.803 --> 01:37:56.803
¶ She just wasn't thinking ¶

01:37:56.805 --> 01:38:01.307
¶ On the day that she looked
   at him and said, "I do" ¶

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:04.644
¶ 'Cause I will always,
 I will always, I will always ¶

01:38:04.646 --> 01:38:09.649
¶ I will always try
   to get my shit together ¶

01:38:09.651 --> 01:38:13.019
¶ I guess we always,
     guess we always knew ¶

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:15.989
¶ That it would be
        stormy weather ¶

01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:18.892
¶ This is how we want you
         to get high ¶

01:38:18.894 --> 01:38:21.194
¶ The way that we show ya ¶

01:38:21.196 --> 01:38:24.530
¶ The way that we told ya
          was decent ¶

01:38:24.532 --> 01:38:28.534
¶ This is how we want you
         to get high ¶

01:38:28.536 --> 01:38:33.439

01:38:36.778 --> 01:38:38.544
¶ He just kept smoking ¶

01:38:38.546 --> 01:38:41.848
¶ Till the jokes he could tell
        got very blue ¶

01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:45.084
¶ My mama was a joker ¶

01:38:45.086 --> 01:38:47.053
¶ If she was a hippie ¶

01:38:47.055 --> 01:38:51.524
¶ Then I guess she was tripping
      on a high love you ¶

01:38:51.526 --> 01:38:54.694
¶ 'Cause I will always,
 I will always, I will always ¶

01:38:54.696 --> 01:38:59.699
¶ I will always try
   to get my shit together ¶

01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:03.236
¶ I guess we always,
     guess we always knew ¶

01:39:03.238 --> 01:39:06.406
¶ That it would be
        stormy weather ¶

01:39:06.408 --> 01:39:09.208
¶ This is how we want you
         to get high ¶

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:11.311

01:39:21.756 --> 01:39:25.258
¶ On your sorry lives ¶

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:27.293
¶ ¶

01:39:29.264 --> 01:39:32.298
¶ Take another, take another ¶

01:39:39.474 --> 01:39:42.008
¶ I never picked a fight
          in my life ¶

01:39:42.010 --> 01:39:44.410
¶ Or raised a hand to my wife ¶

01:39:44.412 --> 01:39:47.780
¶ Or saw my children
      as things to bully ¶

01:39:47.782 --> 01:39:50.316
¶ I never dropped a pill
          in a drink ¶

01:39:50.318 --> 01:39:52.852
¶ I know how low you can sink ¶

01:39:52.854 --> 01:39:56.489
¶ My heart, my heart
     is better than that ¶

01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:58.758
¶ I never picked a fight
          in my life ¶

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.027
¶ Or raised a hand to my wife ¶

01:40:01.029 --> 01:40:04.530
¶ Or saw my children
      as things to bully ¶

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:07.166
