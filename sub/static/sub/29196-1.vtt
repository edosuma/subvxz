24:19.720 --> 24:22.119
- Soz, Dave.
- Get lost!

24:40.000 --> 24:41.080
Sorry.

24:42.760 --> 24:43.879
It's all right.

24:53.439 --> 24:55.600
Come on!

24:59.200 --> 25:02.078
You're not even doing it properly.
Do it again.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.598
- Tosser.
- What?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.877
Leave it. He's an Edlington.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.158
Can I get these
and a pint of red, please?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.680
Yeah, of course you can, mate.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.840
- Thanks.
- There you go.

25:39.479 --> 25:41.877
My mam says thanks
for the calamine lotion.

25:41.879 --> 25:44.760
- We used it all. I got you a new one.
- Thanks, love.

25:47.360 --> 25:48.520
Is Cassie in?

25:50.360 --> 25:52.479
Er, not for you, love.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.638
Tough on crime.

26:25.640 --> 26:28.398
Tough on the causes of crime.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.117
Tough on crime.
Tough on the causes of crime.

26:31.119 --> 26:32.798
Tough on crime.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.437
Tough on the causes of crime.

26:34.439 --> 26:35.798
Turn this over. It's crap.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.838
- That was a partly political broadcast.
- Now...

26:39.840 --> 26:41.760
Could do with a video camera.

26:45.400 --> 26:48.080
When I catch that fish,
you can be on the news.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.718
I thought it was a yellow submarine
when I first saw it.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.558
Then she swirled around
and dived back down to the depths.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.840
Just a ripple.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.998
He's gonna shoot. He shoots! He scores.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.600
Yes! Get in!

27:09.760 --> 27:14.158
I'm off to call her Nessie. What if she
pulls me in and drags me round t'pond?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.400
You'll have to give me
the kiss of life, Trev.

27:17.920 --> 27:18.920
Malcolm!

27:22.720 --> 27:25.360
- What you got?
- Maggots.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.119
I'll get a mixing bowl.
Take these in for us, Malc.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.000
- Cassie. Just give us...
- I don't talk to poofs.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.479
They're still wriggling.

27:48.720 --> 27:50.237
What's she say that for?

27:50.239 --> 27:52.758
- What did you want her for?
- Private.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.640
- I thought she'd finished with you.
- Get lost!

27:57.160 --> 27:59.800
I did get lost once. In the Arndale.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.800
My mam was looking for me everywhere.
We passed each other on the escalator.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.838
Why do we have to wait till tonight
to catch this fish with your Trev?

28:19.840 --> 28:23.160
I've told you. It's too hot.
They don't feed much during the t'day.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.520
That's a leg.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.437
You should have stuck her down on a bit
of card. Corn flakes box or summat.

28:37.439 --> 28:41.879
Yeah, but I like fitting all the bits
together. Save the best bits till last.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.798
- You off fishing?
- Come with us if you want.

28:49.800 --> 28:53.117
I'm off up the arcade. Golden Nugget.

28:53.119 --> 28:56.280
There's a couple of new games.
They're dead good. I went last night.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.237
- Has stopped stinging, then?
- Yeah.

28:59.239 --> 29:00.638
What did you do?

29:00.640 --> 29:03.198
Maurice Edlington
threw us in some nettles.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.840
I only had me shorts on cos it were hot.

29:45.239 --> 29:49.119
How could you put a fish on a tape?
You couldn't, could you?

29:49.800 --> 29:51.518
Unless it was a dolphin.

29:55.479 --> 29:57.038
- Hey, Pogo.
- What?

29:57.040 --> 29:59.278
I'm fishing.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.518
Whoa!

30:02.479 --> 30:03.758
Whoa!

30:04.840 --> 30:06.560
That's a bloody peacock, innit?

30:15.680 --> 30:17.680
- Who's this?
- Trev's band.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.400
Him and Vic and Maurice Edlington.
Innit, Trev?

30:20.920 --> 30:23.398
Your band. They were ace.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.598
They used to practise in t'shed
and leave door open, so we could hear,

30:26.600 --> 30:29.598
and we'd all be doing
head banging in the back, like...

30:37.280 --> 30:38.320
Hi, Cassie.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.918
- I'm thinking of having me hair cut.
- I'll do it for you.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.558
I might go into town.
Number one round here.

31:14.560 --> 31:17.439
- Have it red on top.
- It'll look nice.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.117
My mam says
it'll look like a carbuncle.

31:20.119 --> 31:22.117
- A what?
- A boil.

31:22.119 --> 31:23.237
What did you say?

31:23.239 --> 31:25.998
I told her she looks like
a walnut in a wig.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.680
- Give us a fag.
- Sod off!

31:29.119 --> 31:30.720
- Is your Mam old?
- No.

31:31.479 --> 31:32.840
Just looks it.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.518
We used to have
a majorette's uniform at our house.

31:48.520 --> 31:52.918
My mam said it's what I used to wear,
but it isn't.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.918
You know you said
one of them songs you did

31:54.920 --> 31:56.877
was about a bird
you once went out with?

31:56.879 --> 31:58.198
Yeah.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.838
- And she chucked you, right?
- Right.

32:01.840 --> 32:04.237
So, how long did it take you
to get over it?

32:06.320 --> 32:08.479
A broken heart never mends, Malc.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.800
Oh, shit.

32:13.439 --> 32:16.158
Can't you stop your Cassie
going out with Maurice Edlington?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.158
- For you?
- For hersen.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.477
He's turning her against everybody
and that. Don't you reckon?

32:21.479 --> 32:25.080
It's not for me to tell her, is it?
She's not my proper sister.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.598
- Do you hate him?
- Course I don't.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.560
His brother were your best mate,
wasn't he?

32:31.479 --> 32:35.918
They used to be a couple of good kids,
Vic and Maurice, before everything.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.080
Yeah.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.038
You can't make somebody like you, Malc.

33:09.040 --> 33:12.237
No, I know that.
I can't stop thinking about her, though.

33:12.239 --> 33:14.237
Well, there's nowt you can do about it.

33:14.239 --> 33:17.758
I sometimes try to astral-project
myself into her bedroom.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.398
- Eh?
- I don't mean to do owt.

33:20.400 --> 33:23.520
I mean, just to put my thoughts
into her head.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.038
It's sending me mad.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.598
When I play them arcade games,
I sometimes wish I could get inside

33:29.600 --> 33:32.680
and never come out again,
like in that film.

33:34.720 --> 33:36.640
You won't say owt to her, will you?

33:37.360 --> 33:40.117
I mean, you can tell her
what an ace kid I am and that.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.437
- No. I won't say owt.
- Pogo?

33:42.439 --> 33:45.760
If I was a majorette,
why haven't I got a bugle?

33:48.800 --> 33:50.119
I think I'll get off.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.080
OK. See you.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.477
I've got a sailor's cap, but that
doesn't mean I was in the navy.

34:02.479 --> 34:03.680
And a Davy Crockett hat.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.117
- Do me a summer special now.
- If you like.

34:09.119 --> 34:12.117
Can I have a love song, so I can
remember Malcolm in love in my summer?

34:12.119 --> 34:14.719
Yeah, I'll give it a go.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.478
I'm off for my dinner now, Trev. Bye.

34:20.639 --> 34:21.719

I need to tell you summat.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.040
You see...

38:29.400 --> 38:31.680
..there's not really much room at home.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.398
I'm getting under people's feet a bit.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.439
And...

38:37.600 --> 38:41.920
Well, there i'n't no places,
flats and that, round here, so...

38:44.439 --> 38:45.760
..I'm moving out.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.760
Only to town.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.918
My Auntie Betty in Hexthorpe
works in Pennywise

38:52.920 --> 38:56.718
and she says
there might be a job coming up.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.920
You know, just in the warehouse,
moving boxes.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.400
I think I'm sorted
for somewhere to stay for now.

39:06.640 --> 39:10.280
I've a mate, got a flat near
the hospital. Says I can stop with him.

39:11.439 --> 39:12.479
It's all right.

39:13.879 --> 39:15.920
It'll do till I find somewhere.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.518
Course, I won't be able
to take my tackle with me,

39:21.520 --> 39:23.160
so I'll leave you in charge.

39:25.040 --> 39:28.439
I'll tell my dad to let you come
in the shed if you want.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.560
I'll miss you.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.160
I can't stay here, though, can I?

39:38.439 --> 39:40.560
I can't take you with me.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.280
You look after things here.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.998
Oh, daft ha'p'orth.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.998
I'll come back and see you.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.800
I'll do some tapes.

39:52.680 --> 39:55.640
Look after your mum and Trevor's shed.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.158
Look after all the gear

39:59.160 --> 40:01.479
for when we go
on some more fishing expeditions.

40:04.479 --> 40:07.479
Think about those weekends
down at Decoy Ponds, eh?

40:10.400 --> 40:11.720
Love you.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.398
I'm helping Trevor
mix our secret bait now.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.040
All right, love.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.040
I wish I could sod off.

41:03.320 --> 41:05.640
- Where?
- Anywhere.

41:06.600 --> 41:10.320
I would, but with me dad gone,
and me brother...

41:11.640 --> 41:12.840
..I'm stuck.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.239
What about me?

41:18.320 --> 41:21.477
D'you hear about them two kids
in Rossington?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.518
Parents didn't want 'em
going out together

41:23.520 --> 41:27.920
and her dad got a job somewhere else,
so they were gonna be moving away.

41:28.600 --> 41:31.320
- Do you know what they did?
- What?

41:31.879 --> 41:37.400
They stood between the rails, hand
in hand, in front of the London train.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.040
I could do that.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.558
Maurice, don't say that!

41:43.560 --> 41:47.360
Oh, I could.
Maybe I could do it for you.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.920
Really?

41:52.280 --> 41:53.400
No.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.437
- You don't spell it like that, do you?
- What?

41:58.439 --> 42:00.080
- Cassie.
- Yeah.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.477
- I've spelt it with a K.
- Where?

42:04.479 --> 42:06.998
- I've tattooed it on my leg!
- You lie.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.998
- No, no, no. I have.
- You daft git! Let's have a look!

42:10.000 --> 42:13.198
Help! Somebody help me!

42:13.200 --> 42:14.798
Get off!

42:14.800 --> 42:16.638
Missus! Help! Get off!

42:22.200 --> 42:24.117
That time we saw that couple

42:24.119 --> 42:27.398
and we thought she had a bandage round
her knee, but it were her knickers.

42:29.119 --> 42:32.439
It's me! Malcolm Panks!
I'm not anybody!

42:33.200 --> 42:35.760
You've got me mixed up
with somebody else! Honest!

42:36.600 --> 42:38.477
Look, I can't keep still any longer.

42:38.479 --> 42:40.437
My nettle rash is itching.

42:40.439 --> 42:42.080
Just let me scratch, right?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.798
Don't drop the boulder on me head.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.918
I'm getting neck ache, for fuck's sake!

42:47.920 --> 42:50.117
If it's about Cassie Buckfield,

42:50.119 --> 42:53.237
I used to go out with her,
but I finished with her.

42:53.239 --> 42:54.998
Is it because of that?

42:55.000 --> 42:56.838
I'm suffocating!

42:56.840 --> 42:59.598
Eh, Panksy, what's up?

42:59.600 --> 43:01.918
What are you talking to yourself for?

43:01.920 --> 43:03.360
Who you talking to?

43:07.439 --> 43:08.838
Have they gone?

43:08.840 --> 43:11.358
- Who?
- Them kids.

43:11.360 --> 43:14.477
- What did they do?

43:14.479 --> 43:16.119
Crazy! They're nutters!

43:16.800 --> 43:20.078

- One of 'em had Doc Martens, I think.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.638
What did they say?

43:21.640 --> 43:22.998
One of 'em just said,

43:23.000 --> 43:26.678
"We've got a boulder here and we're
gonna cave your head in if you move."

43:26.680 --> 43:28.078

I'm here.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.520
You're not supposed to eat it.

46:22.560 --> 46:24.080
It's bait for the carp.

47:00.200 --> 47:01.720
That's a good mix.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.237
I think you mixed that well.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.838
Not too soft or it'll come off the hook
when you cast out.

47:07.840 --> 47:10.920
Not too hard or the hook
won't connect when you strike.

47:11.920 --> 47:15.720

all this in the bait boxes, eh?

Hiya, Trev. We've come
to help you get t'tackle ready.

48:10.920 --> 48:14.558
Hiya, Pogo. Is me mam doing us
some sandwiches and a flask?

48:14.560 --> 48:16.798
- She might do you.
- I'm borrowing a proper rod.

48:16.800 --> 48:19.400
- Me mam's getting it this afternoon.
- Well, what sort?

48:20.000 --> 48:23.358
- A fishing rod.
- Yeah, I know, but what type?

48:23.360 --> 48:27.117
Is it a float rod, carp rod,
pike rod, ledger rod?

48:27.119 --> 48:29.080
Me uncle got it at Bridlington.

48:29.879 --> 48:32.158
- A sea-fishing rod?
- Yeah.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.200
You can't... Oh, it'll do.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.038
- How long are we staying out for?
- Will we need to take sleeping bags?

48:38.040 --> 48:39.877
It gets cold at night.

48:39.879 --> 48:42.038
I'm taking a pair
of my mam's old tights.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.237
You poof.

48:43.239 --> 48:45.479
They keep your legs warm,
don't they, Trev?

48:46.080 --> 48:47.918
You wear women's tights?

48:47.920 --> 48:49.520
Sometimes.

48:50.239 --> 48:52.119
What's it like?

48:53.239 --> 48:56.198
Look, you two can be putting
the rods and the bank sticks in my bag.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.600
It's all out there.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.040
You all right now?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.760
I think I need to use the toilet.

49:07.479 --> 49:09.640
Come on. I'll take you home.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.320
I bet it's dead spooky
down there at night, don't you?

49:28.160 --> 49:31.198
Yeah. We might see a ghost.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.398
Whooo!

49:33.400 --> 49:35.158
Very funny.

49:35.160 --> 49:36.877
- Hey, you're fishing, right?
- Right.

49:36.879 --> 49:38.437
There's this ghost behind you

49:38.439 --> 49:41.278
with his head tucked under his arm.

49:41.280 --> 49:44.398
- And you swing back to cast out.
- Yeah.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.119
And you hook his head.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.998
Then it goes... ptoooooh

49:50.000 --> 49:53.918
- into the middle of the pond.
- Then it goes...

49:53.920 --> 49:56.840
- That would be funny.
- Wouldn't it?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.877
There's a notepad in t'cupboard.

50:40.879 --> 50:41.998
I'm not writing.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.239
You are.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.200

Hey.

51:01.119 --> 51:03.160
She's having a bit of a lie-down.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.680
She'll be right as rain
in an hour or so.

51:09.360 --> 51:10.760
I'll look after her.

51:11.479 --> 51:12.800
Oh, I know you will.

51:14.680 --> 51:17.560
Anyway, you've got to take her.

51:18.320 --> 51:19.640
I'm off out.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.798
- Oh?
- Hmm.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.479
Next door's asked me to go with 'em
up t'club for a couple of hours.

51:27.920 --> 51:31.000
- What do you think?
- You should.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.638
It's a change of scenery, innit?

51:34.640 --> 51:36.760
Not the bingo. I can't stand that.

51:38.879 --> 51:40.360
You don't think I'm being...?

51:41.520 --> 51:42.600

52:05.760 --> 52:07.160
They're in the street.

52:08.119 --> 52:10.439
They're coming in
through your letterbox.

52:11.119 --> 52:12.600
up your stairs,

52:13.080 --> 52:14.640
under your bedroom door.

52:16.160 --> 52:17.479
I'm in your room.

52:21.280 --> 52:23.237
I'm sat next to you.

52:23.239 --> 52:27.358
Don't be scared.
It's just a close encounter.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.800
Can you feel my love reaching out?

52:32.080 --> 52:33.160
I love you.

52:40.080 --> 52:43.040
I've got one of your hair slides.

52:44.439 --> 52:46.640
I nicked it
from your kitchen the other day.

52:55.920 --> 52:57.640
Can you feel me kissing you?

52:59.439 --> 53:01.879
Oh, Cassie, please be me girlfriend.

53:03.040 --> 53:07.117
Look, Maurice Edlington don't love you,
not the way I do.

53:07.119 --> 53:08.160
Malcolm!

53:09.479 --> 53:11.877
Hang on. Me mam's shouting me.

53:11.879 --> 53:13.280
What are you doing?

53:39.760 --> 53:42.680
Never been cleaned since you've had it,
by the looks of it.

53:44.239 --> 53:46.879
- How many are you feeding?
- Me and David.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.918
Well, go easy with the butter.
That's all there is.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.439
Cassie!

53:53.200 --> 53:55.879
Cassie!

53:56.520 --> 53:58.479
Go and tell her to turn it down,
will you?

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
Cassie!

54:11.600 --> 54:12.879
Cassie!

54:18.680 --> 54:20.520
Sorry. Your mam says turn it down.

54:21.239 --> 54:25.720
Down's not off.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.479
Thanks.

54:30.320 --> 54:32.800
- Where are you off?
- Why?

54:33.840 --> 54:36.280
- Are you off out with Maurice?
- What if I am?

54:37.879 --> 54:40.360
- I'm trying to...
- I can look after myself, thank you.

54:40.920 --> 54:42.518
I'm not a little kid.

54:42.520 --> 54:44.879
I'm not half-baked like that Pogo.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.798
Just be careful around him.

54:46.800 --> 54:49.358
Maurice is a laugh.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.760
He's not boring like you
and everybody else around here.

54:52.439 --> 54:55.920
I don't need you trying to tell me
how to run my life. Look at your own.

54:56.879 --> 54:58.600
What do you do, eh?

54:59.239 --> 55:00.600
What do you do?

55:02.360 --> 55:03.360
Pathetic.

55:08.600 --> 55:11.598
Just leave my stuff alone, will you?

55:11.600 --> 55:14.198
Get out! Go on.
Get out. This is my room!

55:14.200 --> 55:16.117
- It used to be mine.
- Yeah, well...

55:16.119 --> 55:18.998
It doesn't mean you can just waltz in
whenever you like.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.158
Get out, go on!
Go and play with your floats!

55:21.160 --> 55:24.119
His brother Vic is away
because of a girl.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.239
- What?
- His brother is in prison.

55:30.840 --> 55:32.080
What did he do?

55:34.560 --> 55:35.879
He took her in t'woods.

55:37.280 --> 55:40.040
She thought
they were just going for a walk.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.000
It finished their family.

55:44.360 --> 55:47.920
Kids at school would shout things
about Vic and Maurice'd go berserk.

55:48.640 --> 55:51.237
I mean, like, really crazy.

55:51.239 --> 55:52.720
He's eaten up with it, Cassie.

55:53.879 --> 55:55.280
It's sent him bad.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.520
I think you've done this room lovely.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.200
Better than when I had it.

57:17.920 --> 57:22.918
You can put
your trust in me and I vow to you,

57:22.920 --> 57:28.038
I shall repay that trust
with unstinting service and dedication

57:28.040 --> 57:30.278

57:48.080 --> 57:50.358
So you're going to see him
for "definate"?

57:50.360 --> 57:54.439
- Yeah.
- Well, "definite" is I-N-I not I-N-A.

57:58.400 --> 58:00.638
And I want to see a community

58:00.640 --> 58:03.237
where if it's not good
enough for my children,

58:03.239 --> 58:07.200
then it's good enough for theirs
and anyone else's in our society.

Broached it?

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.798
Well, if I don't tell you owt
and you don't listen to gossip,

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.518
we could last a fair bit.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.160
Yeah. If you want us to.

01:03:50.119 --> 01:03:52.558
I can't find me reel.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:55.117
We've got to have put it
in the tackle bag!

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:58.598
Shh. You have to keep quiet
when you're fishing.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.598
You're an expert, are you, Pogo?

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.720
I'm going to be.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:06.358
I'm going to have to go back
and get it. Come with us.

01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.838
- I'm not. You go.
- Oh, come on.

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.119
- Trev?
- What?

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:14.718
- Put me hook on for us.
- In a minute.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.358
He's doing mine first.
You'll have to wait.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.800
- Pogo?
- What?

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:33.560
Can I kiss your girlfriend?

01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:39.520
I wanna do what you want.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.040
- I don't wanna say...
- What?

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.998
- You get me confused.
- How?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.560
Well, I get scared, all right?

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.280
What about?

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.758
Well, I'm... I'm scared

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:55.758
if you know how much I think about you,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.520
you'll get scared and leave me.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.598
I don't get scared. I'm hard me.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.040
Steel.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.479
- You all right?
- Fuck off, bastard.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.840
Couple of announcements
before the bingo.

01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.838
Correction to picture quiz last night.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.080
Question number ten.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.638
Aye. Yeah. I can only go
on what's written in front of me.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.320
Come on!

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.758
After consideration,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.318
I have to concede
that photo was Tony Blair

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.877
and not, as was on my answer sheet,
Bobby Darin.

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:58.798
So any as put Tony Blair
and were on 23 points,

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.918
I think that were Archie's table,

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.918
we'll sort out a meat board for you.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.718
We can't give you the meat board
what won

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.558
as t'sausages have been had,
so I'm told.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.877
Yeah!

01:06:07.879 --> 01:06:11.320
Right, so it's Tony Blair
for number ten.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.318
Fat chance of that.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.840
Right. Er, moving on.

01:06:18.439 --> 01:06:21.080
Go on! Just clear off.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.520
Chuck some ground bait
in for us, Dave.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.720
Belt out a few free offerings,
little balls of ground bait.

01:06:38.239 --> 01:06:42.158
- Is nobody coming with us?
- In a bit. Let me catch summat first.

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.800
- Where, Trev?
- Four swims in line with each rod.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.760
- About there?
- A bit further.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.200
- Can I start now?
- No, not yet.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.040
Come on, Nessie.
Come and pick up all them tasty morsels.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.040
Quiet!

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.918
I spy with my little eye...

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.998
Something beginning with T.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.439
- Torch.
- Tackle box.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.237
- You're not playing.
- Trumpet.

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.680
Settle down.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.479
Sorry, Trev. I'm getting excited.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.080
I thought you were my mate.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.918
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:52.198
There's already a notice gone up.
But I guess some of you can't read.

01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:54.798
It's been brought
to the attention of the committee

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.918
that the area behind the fire doors

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.400
is being used
by certain individuals as a urinal.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.198
Any person found doing so

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:11.598
will be suspended from club membership
forthwith indefinitely.

01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:13.278
You have been warned.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.080
Right, eyes down.

01:08:25.879 --> 01:08:27.598
Shh! Shut up.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:31.238
- What?
- I heard summat. Listen.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.758
It's a ghost!

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.997
- Don't.
- Huh!

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.358
I can't see where it's going.
It's got no head.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:42.479
Shut up.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:51.398
- Hiya!
- Bloody hell!

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:53.080
- What?
- Quiet!

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:57.117
- How you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

01:08:57.118 --> 01:08:59.278
- How many you got?
- Eh?

01:08:59.279 --> 01:09:01.598
- Fish.
- I've only just started.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.318
I'm going back on me own, then.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.798
Chuffin' hell! Will you shut up?

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.318
Hang on, then.
Look after me rod for us, Malc.

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:12.278
Don't catch owt, though.
Leave it for when I come back, right?

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:13.560
Yeah, sure.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.840
It's great, innit?

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.479
Stars coming out and that.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.319
Everything still.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:33.920
It's like a different place at night.

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:37.798
- Same as school.
- Eh?

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.158
That's different at night.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.279
Hmm.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.000
No, I mean... this bit.

01:09:45.879 --> 01:09:47.279
It's sort of special.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:55.760
Like one of them cathedrals
where you have to talk quiet.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.518
- What's that?
- It's Dave turning into a werewolf.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.160
That star reflected down there.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.200
It's like fishing in the universe.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.360
- Oh, Christ!
- Don't stop.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.518
The bit where
his hand starts to ripple

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.838
and the hair starts to grow.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.078
Yeah, and his jaw came right out.
It were ace, weren't it?

01:11:07.119 --> 01:11:08.198
What's up?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.558
You just poked your finger
in my eye!

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.678
Oh, soz.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.518
I can't see.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.278
Right in me fucking eyeball!

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.998
Soz. Soz, Dave.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.318
That bloody hurt!

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.158
I said I'm sorry.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.918
You fucking dickhead.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.638
Well, it hurt me
when you bit me in the neck before.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.520
What am I suppose tell me mam?
Dave Buckfield give me a love bite?

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.398
Oi! I'm gonna kill you!

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.477
Get off! Get off, you!

01:11:35.479 --> 01:11:37.237
I hate you!

01:11:42.119 --> 01:11:43.558
Get... Get off!

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.119
- What's that?
- What?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.560
- That lump on your leg?
- Nowt!

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.560
- What you got on?
- Eh?

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:52.758
- Let's have a look.
- Get off!

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:53.918
You've got stockings on!

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.198
I haven't!

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:57.398
Yeah, you have.
What's that, a suspender belt?

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.918
No!

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.437
- Yes, it is! You've got stockings on!
- Get off!

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:12.998
I'm off home.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.198
Didn't your mam have any tights?

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.798
She'd only lend me these.

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.439
She thinks I'm using 'em
to net tiddlers.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.117
Don't tell.

01:12:22.119 --> 01:12:23.600
Don't tell anyone, Dave.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.040
What do they feel like?

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:30.678
They feel all right.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.078
What, sexy?

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.479
Yeah, a bit.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.278
What if you'd have got knocked over
on t'way round our house?

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.200
I know. I were thinking that.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.760
Last time I come here
at night, I chucked some magazines in.

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.558
What?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:59.558
Some mucky magazines.
My mam found 'em in my bedroom.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:02.798
She wouldn't let me put 'em in dustbin
in case the dustbin man found 'em.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.117
So I got a sack out of the coal shed,
put 'em in that,

01:13:07.119 --> 01:13:09.718
came down here and...

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.239
Pffff!

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.920
Trev?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.800
Hmm?

01:13:26.879 --> 01:13:28.640
You know when you get older...

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.360
..do you, like,
understand things better?

01:13:33.239 --> 01:13:34.280
No.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.560
What happens, then?

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.520
You just have more things
you don't understand.

01:13:50.119 --> 01:13:51.720
Is that why you come fishing?

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.078
- I don't wanna get older.
- Who does?

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.840
Me! I do. You can give me your years
if you don't want 'em.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.638
My mam says
she still feels 16 in her head.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.040
But she can't do.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.920
I mean, she never has a laugh or owt.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.439
Do you still feel 16?

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.760
- No.
- No.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.117
Y-You sort of act
like someone in their 20s.

01:14:26.119 --> 01:14:27.439
- I am.
- Yeah.

01:14:30.239 --> 01:14:31.560
This is weird, innit?

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:41.358
♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:46.360
♪ How I wonder what you are

We've come for a reel.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.040
He forgot it.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.160
It's in here somewhere.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.437
- Look for it, then.
- It doesn't matter.

01:15:23.439 --> 01:15:25.040
Come on, quick!

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.998
We didn't know
there was anybody in here.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.119
Well, there is.

01:15:37.879 --> 01:15:39.000
Found it.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.920
I know you, don't I?

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.237
- No.
- What's up?

01:15:47.239 --> 01:15:49.477
- I know him.
- So?

01:15:49.479 --> 01:15:51.040
Don't I?

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.080
- No.
- What's going on?

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.078
Come on, Maurice. Let him out.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.998
Never forget a face.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.638
Yesterday, do you remember where it was?

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.398
He were down at the ponds yesterday
watching a bloke fishing.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.040
You weren't watching something else?

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.838
Leave him, Maurice.
Let him go now. Don't frighten him.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:10.918
You're a good runner, aren't you?

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:12.320
No.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.638
You're a little jack rabbit!

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.998
Tell him, Cassie. He's my mate.
Tell him to pack it in.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.117
Maurice.

01:16:19.119 --> 01:16:21.718
This little jack rabbit
was watching us yesterday.

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.198
- Was it you?
- I didn't see anything.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.638
- There was nothing to see!
- I know.

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:28.798
You enjoy it, watching in the woods?

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.437
- No.
- Just a hobby? Like trainspotting?

01:16:31.439 --> 01:16:34.558
Leave him, Maurice, please.
He's my mate. He didn't mean anything.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.437
He won't do it again. Will you?

01:16:36.439 --> 01:16:38.558
Did we get a five-star rating?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.119
He doesn't understand what
you're on about. Leave it now. Come on.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.000
- Do you like girls?
- Do something!

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:51.560
- They're all right.
- Do you know what you are, eh?

01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:53.920
- Eh?
- Yes.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.838
- What?
- I'm going. Let me out!

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:58.080
What?

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.358
A pervert.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.437
He doesn't mean anything.
He's just a kid.

01:17:06.439 --> 01:17:09.439
- Don't take it out on him.
- Don't take what out on him?

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:12.477
We let him get away with it, then?

01:17:12.479 --> 01:17:14.720
We let the dirty little bastard go?

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.479
Go on! Sod off!

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.119
Don't take what out on him?

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.400
What's Trevor been telling you, then?

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:50.398
- Come on.
- I'm off home.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.518
Oh, come on. Come on, Shane.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.680
I'm off in.

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.998
What am I doing, then?

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.360
I'll see ya.

01:18:02.239 --> 01:18:03.400
Hey...

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.600
So what did he tell you, then?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:34.160
He was on about what your brother did.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.520
He told me who the girl was.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.239
It was Pogo, wasn't it?

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:57.117
Why do moths fly into the light?

01:18:57.119 --> 01:18:58.640
Maybe he's afraid of the dark.

01:18:59.439 --> 01:19:01.560
So why don't they just
fly about in daytime?

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.358
I still sleep with my curtains open.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:10.237
Me mam says God put stars in the sky to
keep us from being afraid of the dark.

01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:11.520
I used to be.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:13.918
Did you, Trev?

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:15.400
I can't remember.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.160
You grow out of all that.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.877
Trev, can I reel it in
to see if my bait's still on?

01:19:21.879 --> 01:19:23.558
It might have come off. Can I check it?

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.040
If you want, yeah.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.437
Oh, no.

01:19:28.439 --> 01:19:30.479
- What?
- Oh, no, I knew this would happen.

01:19:31.239 --> 01:19:32.877
It's doing it!

01:19:32.879 --> 01:19:34.600
Oh, fuck! There's a fish on it.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.398
- What do I do?
- Strike! Strike!

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.318
Oh! There's summat on!

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.598
Oh, it's caught mine! Strike, you fool!

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.237
Oh, bloody bananas!
I've got summat here.

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.117
Keep your rod up!

01:19:47.119 --> 01:19:49.918
- What is it, a carp or a pike?
- Carp, I think.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.117
Feels like an octopus on heat!

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:54.720
Oh, it's coming in
like a wet sack, Trev!

01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:58.598
- So's mine.
- Oh!

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.598
- What is it?
- Is it Nessie?

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:02.278
What we got?

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.160
You've caught each other
and half a ton of weed.

01:20:06.479 --> 01:20:10.000
Is that all? I had a fish, didn't I?

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.200
Pogo's line must have caught yours
when she reeled in. No fish.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.198
I nearly had a bloody heart attack
cos of you!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.798
Look after me rod, Pogo,
while I untangle this lot.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:23.078
You shouldn't
have been fishing so close.

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.598
- I didn't cast it!
- Hey, pack it in, you two.

01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.800
Knobhead.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.437
Do you want some help?

01:20:29.439 --> 01:20:31.278
Yeah. Grab hold of that end.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.078
You'll have to cut the line.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:36.000
I thought we'd found
your porn collection, Malc.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:18.200
If that's what you want.
Do what you want. I don't care.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.920
Cassie.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:27.560
Turn around.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.360
Turn around.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.160
What's this, eh?

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.879
A dead donkey?

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.758
This is Nessie, this is!

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.439
- Whoa! Hold on!
- I can do it. Let me do it.

01:22:57.439 --> 01:23:00.918
She's moving. She's going down.
I can feel her getting deeper.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:05.239
- Come on.
- Slowing down.

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.160
She's stopped.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:17.879
I can't shift her. She's massive.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.358
Hmm.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.437
Yellow submarine.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:35.198
Don't try to reel in.
You'll snap off. Just hold. Just wait.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.838
When she goes, just let her go.

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.237
There's some reeds down this side.
Make sure she doesn't get in them.

01:23:41.239 --> 01:23:44.117
If she goes towards the reeds,
just pull her away.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.439
Keep it tight. Pull sideways.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.598
And she'll come around.

01:23:51.439 --> 01:23:53.398
She's going! She's going! We're off!

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.398
- Just let me...
- No! Me! Let me!

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.918
Let me tighten the reel.
She's taking too much line.

01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.838
It must be the Loch Ness Monster!

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.718
Yippee! There she blows!

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.278
Watch what you're doing! Watch it!

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.278
Come on, girl. Come on, Nessie.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:08.078
Start to reel in. Keep it tight.

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:11.078
You're doing great. If the hook's
well in her lip, she's yours.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:14.078
- Can the hook come out?
- A big 'un can bend the hook.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:16.158
- A fish?
- Yeah, sometimes the line just snaps.

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.280
- What, and the hook stays in?
- Shut up, will you? Shut it!

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.558
Keep it tight. Don't force it.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.237
Oh, Trev, she feels fantastic!

01:24:25.239 --> 01:24:27.838
I can feel her muscles
trembling through the line.

01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:31.760
- Come on, Nessie.
- Come on, Nessie. Come on, girl.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.477
Can you see?

01:24:34.479 --> 01:24:37.038
Shit! She's had enough.
She's tiring.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.000
Get the net.
Pass us the landing net, Malc.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:42.360
The landing net,
not the bloody keep net!

01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:46.237
- It's better than arcade games, this.
- Don't let me lose her.

01:24:46.239 --> 01:24:49.320
Not now. Please. I promise I'll be good.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.000
Just let me hold her.
Just let me see her.

01:24:53.879 --> 01:24:55.718
I won't hurt you, Nessie. I promise.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.638
- Come on, Nessie. That's it.
- There she is!

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.078
- Come on. Come on.
- Go on, Trev.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:02.560
Come on, Nessie.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.479
She's huge!

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.398
I've got her.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.640
Look at this! Look at this!

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:15.318
- Oh, man!
- That's amazing!

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.278
It must weigh 15, maybe 18 pounds.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:20.117
- Have I hurt her?
- No, I'm taking the hook out now.

01:25:20.119 --> 01:25:22.437
Don't make it hurt her, Trev.

01:25:22.439 --> 01:25:24.918
It won't.
There's no barb on these hooks.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.320
There. Done.

01:25:32.879 --> 01:25:35.080
Does this make it your best summer?

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.000
She's lovely.

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.439
It's the biggest fish
ever caught here, and you caught it.

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.998
She doesn't like it out here, Trev.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.638
She wants to go back in the water.
Let's put her back now.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.358
Just let me try and weigh her first.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.360
- I've got some scales somewhere.
- No, no.

01:25:58.879 --> 01:26:00.920
We know it's Nessie. We don't need that.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.280
Please put her back, Trev.

01:26:04.119 --> 01:26:05.400
It's your catch.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.358
Her little eye is telling me
she wants to go.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.600
She wants to go back in the water, Trev.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.320

He's got another think coming
if he thinks I'm gonna miss him.

01:31:07.479 --> 01:31:10.518
I don't need a bodyguard, you know.
You don't have to stay.

01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.320
Do you think I'm gonna nick something?

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.360
- Do you want me to go?
- No.

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.680
It won't take me long to forget him.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:25.280
I'll soon forget him,
just like I forget everything else.

01:31:46.439 --> 01:31:48.160
Your Trevor helped me.

01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.640
He'll be coming back, though, won't he?
Sometimes?

01:31:53.239 --> 01:31:54.360
Yes.

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.437
When I go to the hospital
for the last time,

01:32:01.439 --> 01:32:03.840
will I have forgotten everything?

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.720
Will it be like a blank tape?

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.879
You'll remember Trevor.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.080
Why?

01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:15.600
Because he loves you.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.760
Does he?

01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:23.720
Yes. I'll remember Trevor loves me.

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:27.879
And I love my mam and she loves me.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.119
And I love Jesus and he loves me.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:37.439
They'll probably get mixed up so I think
me mam is Jesus and Trevor is me mam.

01:32:39.439 --> 01:32:43.158
But I'll have the love, though,
won't I? That'll still be there.

01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:47.437
I won't remember where it came from,
but I can take it with me, can't I?

01:32:47.439 --> 01:32:51.078
I can take it with me when I go up
to meet Jesus and give it back to him.

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.320
It all came from him in the first place,
didn't it?

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:55.239
I don't know.

01:32:56.239 --> 01:32:58.518
We're learning about drugs in RE.

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:09.198
Hello, Malcolm.

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:11.239
What's up with her?

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:13.119
Her and Maurice have finished.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.598
- Have they?
- Last night.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:19.080
- Really?
- Yes.

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.360
Go on, then.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.718
- What?
- Ask her to go out with you.

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.680
- Do you think I should?
- Go on.

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:32.920
I can't.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.400
My hands are all sweaty.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.800
I could do with some roll-on.

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:45.600
Wish me luck, then.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.237
Good luck.

01:33:48.239 --> 01:33:50.200
I'll let you know how it goes.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.439
I think I'm sorted
for somewhere to stay for now.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.800
I've a mate, got a flat near
the hospital. Says I can stop with him.

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.439
It's all right.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.640
It'll do till I find somewhere.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.598
Course, I won't be able
to take my tackle with me,

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.239
so I'll leave you in charge.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:28.439
I'll tell my dad to let you come
in the shed if you want.

01:34:33.239 --> 01:34:34.640
I'll miss you.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.360
I can't stay here, though, can I?

01:34:40.119 --> 01:34:41.760
I can't take you with me.
