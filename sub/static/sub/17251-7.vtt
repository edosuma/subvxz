SOMEONE WHO CHEATED ON ME
WITH THAT BUSBOY.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.778

01:38.332 --> 01:40.234
- BRIAN, SUPPLY CLOSET, NOW.

- IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
I THINK THAT YOUR EYES

01:41.535 --> 01:44.172
ARE WAY MORE SOULFUL
THAN ALEJANDRO'S.

01:44.205 --> 01:47.408

05:52.953 --> 05:55.923

I HALF EXPECTED

06:29.657 --> 06:32.526

TWO SEATS ON THE GLASS,
BLACKHAWKS/BRUINS.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.108
- YEAH, WAY BETTER THAN
GOING TO A DUMB WEDDING.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.410
- IS THAT THE SAME DAY

07:18.338 --> 07:19.773
IT'S SLOW PITCH, MAN.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.308
THAT WAS A FREAKING
LASER BEAM.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.676
- ALL RIGHT, SIR.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.244
DROP YOUR PANTS.
LET ME EXAMINE THE INJURY.

- THE SOONER YOU DROP 'EM,

07:25.646 --> 07:27.515
THE SOONER WE CAN GET YOU
FIXED UP.

07:27.548 --> 07:28.682
- NO NEED TO WORRY, SIR.
IT'S A COMMON SPORTS INJURY.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.450
IT HURTS LIKE HELL,
BUT NINE TIMES OUTTA TEN

07:30.484 --> 07:31.919
IT'S JUST A LITTLE--
OH, MY GOD.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.587
- WHAT?

07:33.621 --> 07:35.523
- OH, MY GOD,
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.625
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BALLS?
- I CAN'T DO THIS.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.159
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY BALLS?

07:39.192 --> 07:41.094
AM I GONNA LOSE MY BALLS?
OH, MY GOD!

07:41.128 --> 07:42.596
- JUST CALM DOWN.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:42.630 --> 07:43.797
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
JUST CALM DOWN.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.966
- HE SAID--WHAT DID HE MEAN?

07:45.999 --> 07:47.801
- IT'S A BRUISE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.269
NOW WE COULD TAKE YOU
TO THE UROLOGIST,

07:49.302 --> 07:51.171
BUT BETWEEN
THE DOCTOR AND THE NURSE

07:51.204 --> 07:52.640
THAT'S JUST TWO MORE PEOPLE
THAT ARE GONNA SEE YOUR JUNK.

07:52.673 --> 07:53.941
YOUR BEST BET IS TO ICE IT DOWN
FOR 20 MINUTES

07:53.974 --> 07:55.475
AND WALK IT OFF.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.977
BRIAN, HANDLE THIS.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.613
- BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN
ONE OF THESE BEFORE.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.349
HI.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.317
WHAT I MEANT WAS
I'VE NEVER DEALT

08:04.351 --> 08:05.819
WITH THIS
PARTICULAR INJURY.

08:05.853 --> 08:09.990
I'VE OBVIOUSLY
SEEN PENISES BEFORE.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.826
NOT A LOT.
MOSTLY MINE.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.128
AND OLD GUYS
AT THE GYM.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.830
WHAT IS IT WITH OLD GUYS
AND NUDITY?

08:16.864 --> 08:18.732
- YEAH, RIGHT?
- EXACTLY.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.969
- SHUT UP, GREG!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.905
- OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA--
RIGHT.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.374
- THAT GUY'S PENIS.

08:27.407 --> 08:28.709
- YEAH?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.011
- GOD, THIS IS SO STUPID.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.846
- TELL ME, BRO.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.584
- THAT GUY HAD THE EXACT
SAME PENIS AS JEFF THE CHEF.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.586
THE EXACT SAME ONE.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.588
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.155
- DON'T THEY ALL PRETTY MUCH
LOOK THE SAME?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.857
- SOMETIMES IF THERE'S
A LOT OF GUYS INVOLVED

08:43.891 --> 08:45.893
AND I'M DRUNK, YEAH.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.228
BUT JEFF'S,
HIS WAS SPECIAL.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.765
I COULD PICK HIS DICK OUT OF
A ROOM FULL OF DICKS.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.034
- WE'RE A LITTLE OUTSIDE
OF MY AREA OF EXPERTISE HERE.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.036
- I JUST WASN'T EXPECTING
TO SEE MY PAST

08:56.069 --> 08:57.738
STARING ME IN THE FACE
LIKE THAT, JOHN.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.040
GOD, SH--.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.075
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHERE AM I GOING?

09:02.109 --> 09:03.711
WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING TO ME?

09:03.744 --> 09:06.413
THAT INVITATION
REALLY MESSED ME UP, BRO.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.749
- I KNOW.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.620
I KNOW.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
THINK THERESA COULD PICK MY DICK
OUT OF A ROOM FULL OF DICKS?

09:14.655 --> 09:17.090
- HANK, WE GOT A CALL
FROM YOUR MOM.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.558
SHE NEEDS HELP
AT THE HOUSE.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.794
- GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.
- WE'RE ON IT.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.730
- REMIND HER THAT DISPATCH

09:22.763 --> 09:24.197
ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE USED
FOR PERSONAL CALLS.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.433
- OKAY, ROGER THAT.
WE GOT IT.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.868
LISTEN, YOU GOT THIS.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.637
LOOK AT ME.
YOU GOT THIS.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.705
- IT'S JUST THAT SHE--
- OKAY, WE GOT IT!

09:31.739 --> 09:33.306
BRIAN, LET'S ROLL.
WE'RE WHEELS UP.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.875
STOP PLAYING
WITH THAT GUY'S BALLS.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.077
- THERE'S MY BABY.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.412
- HEY, MAMA.
- HEY, MAMA SAINT.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.448
- HI, JOHNNY.
- WE CAN'T STAY LONG.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.916
- YOU NEED SOMETHING FIXED,
MAMA SAINT?

09:42.950 --> 09:44.484
- OH, NO,
I DON'T NEED YOU BOYS

09:44.517 --> 09:45.753
TO DO ANY CHORES FOR ME TODAY.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.120
BUT A LITTLE BIRD
JUST TOLD ME

09:47.154 --> 09:48.822
ABOUT JEFF THE CHEF,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.423
AND I HAD TO CHECK IN
WITH MY BABY.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.159
- WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.161
- SORRY, DEUCE, YOUR MOM
GAVE ME SOME WINE.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.897
I JUST STARTED KINDA
RUNNING OFF AT THE MOUTH.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.066
- CASSIUS TOLD ME THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO THE WEDDING.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.401
IS THAT TRUE?
- YES.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.170
- HENRY ST. CLARE,
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

10:03.203 --> 10:04.738
GOING TO THAT WEDDING.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.007
YOU WILL NOT HANG
YOUR HEAD IN SHAME.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.842
THIS IS A PROUD FAMILY.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.778
AND YOU ARE
A PROUD BLACK MAN.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.747
YOU DO NOT RUN AWAY
FROM SITUATIONS SUCH AS THIS.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.615
YOU'RE GONNA WALK IN THERE
WITH YOUR HEAD HELD HIGH,

10:15.649 --> 10:18.085
AND YOU'RE GONNA SHINE
LIKE A PRECIOUS STONE.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.920
SIT IN THE FRONT,
SMILE THE BIGGEST,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.254
SING THE LOUDEST.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.690
AND IF THE PREACHER ASKS,

10:22.723 --> 10:24.792
"DOES ANYONE OBJECT
TO THIS WEDDING?"

10:24.825 --> 10:29.429
YOU'RE GONNA STAND UP AND SAY,
"HELL, NO, I DON'T."

10:29.462 --> 10:32.700
HENRY, PROMISE ME YOU'LL
GO TO THE WEDDING.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.301
- MOM, I'M NOT GOING!

10:34.334 --> 10:36.336
- HANK, YOUR MAMA ASKED YOU
TO MAKE A PROMISE.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.705
NOW I KNOW
I'M NOT YOUR DADDY,

10:37.738 --> 10:39.707
BUT I DO SIT AT
THE HEAD OF THE TABLE,

10:39.740 --> 10:42.109
AND I DO GET THE EXTRA PIECE
OF MEAT WHEN THERE IS ONE.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.944
WE'RE WATCHING
OUR CHOLESTEROL.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.513
MINE'S SUPPOSED TO BE UP
OVER 200 OR SOMETHING.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.983
HALF THE PROGRAMS ON
THE DVR ARE MY PROGRAMS.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.052
I GOT ABOUT SIX PAIRS
OF DRAWERS IN THE DRYER.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.120
WHERE WAS I GOING
WITH THIS?

10:53.153 --> 10:54.888
HELP ME OUT.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.790
- YOU WERE TELLING HIM
TO GO TO THE WEDDING.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.358
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOUR MAMA SAID.

10:58.391 --> 11:02.295
GO TO THAT WEDDING TOMORROW
AND SHINE LIKE A GEM.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.032
JUST MAKE THE PROMISE, SON,
AND MAKE IT NOW.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.867
- FINE, I'LL GO.
BYE, MAMA.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
- SEE?

11:09.036 --> 11:11.171
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
FATHER FIGURE.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.040
- OH, HE'S NOT GOING, PADRE.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.175
HE'S JUST SAYING THAT
TO SHUT YOU UP.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.977
- YOU ARE?
- YEP.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.146
WE'RE GOING TO
THE BLACKHAWKS-BRUINS GAME.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.714
BYE, MAMA.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.215
- DAMN!

11:22.249 --> 11:24.184
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THESE KIDS TODAY?

11:24.217 --> 11:27.354
- OH, SHUT UP AND LET'S HAVE
OURSELVES A GOOD DAY.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.589
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.328
- DAMN GREAT DAY
FOR A GAME.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.596
- OH, YEAH, BEERS.
- FIGHTS.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.865
- BODY CHECKS.
- JONATHAN TOEWS.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.199
- PATRICK KANE.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.101
- PATRICK KANE'S
EYES AND HIS ASS.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.836
- OKAY.
OKAY, JUST THIS ONCE

11:42.870 --> 11:45.038
I WILL TALK TO YOU ABOUT
PATRICK KANE'S EYES AND HIS ASS,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.674
BECAUSE TODAY I'M GONNA BE THE
GREATEST WINGMAN OF ALL TIME.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.910
AND TONIGHT,
I'M GONNA GET YOU LAID.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.444
NOT THAT YOU
NEED ANY HELP,

11:51.478 --> 11:52.946
'CAUSE YOU CAN BASICALLY
SNAP YOUR FINGERS

11:52.980 --> 11:54.882
AND THEN 20 BLOWJOBS
APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.217
WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE
TO HAVE YOUR LIFE.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.586
I MEAN, JUST ALL
THE ONE-NIGHT STANDS

11:59.619 --> 12:00.954
AND CASUAL SEX.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.555
I MEAN, SEX IS NEVER
CASUAL FOR ME, EVER.

12:02.589 --> 12:06.093
LIKE, LIKE EVER.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.060
WHOA!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.528
WHERE WE GOING?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.897
- WEDDING.
I CHANGED MY MIND.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.198
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.532
BUT IT IS AN EMERGENCY.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.267
THREE WORDS:
PATRICK KANE'S ASS.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.269
- I FEEL LIKE SUCH A PUSSY
FOR RUNNING AWAY FROM THIS.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.205
I'M 6'5", 220,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.807
AND LIKE MY MAMA SAY,
WE DON'T RUN FROM SH--.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.108
- WEDDING STARTS AT 1:00.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.475
- WE CAN STILL
MAKE THE RECEPTION.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.111
- I'M WEARING
A STAN MIKITA T-SHIRT.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.046
- I GOT ONE OF JEFF'S OLD SUITS
BACK AT THE HOUSE.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.647
- YOU KNOW THIS THING'S WORTH,
LIKE, 50 BUCKS ON EBAY, RIGHT?

12:27.680 --> 12:30.150
- THE SUIT I'M GIVING YOU
IS WORTH A THOUSAND.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.985
- I COULD USE A NEW SUIT.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.788
[upbeat music]

12:34.822 --> 12:37.757
*

12:37.791 --> 12:39.592
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- HOW DO YOU WANNA LOOK?

12:39.626 --> 12:41.895
- CROSS BETWEEN SIDNEY POITIER
AND SHAFT.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.630
- OKAY.
OKAY, I GET THAT.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.232
THROW IN A LITTLE
DENZEL STROLL TOO.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.800
- MM.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.902
- AGH, I WISH I WAS BLACK
RIGHT NOW.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.971
- HANK!

12:51.004 --> 12:52.605
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.307
- HOLY SH--,
THAT DRESS IS BANGIN'.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.243
- THANK YOU.
MY DATE BRIAN CHOSE IT.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.945
- I GAVE HER A FEW LOOKS.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- VERY, VERY HANDSOME.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.781
- HOW WAS THE CEREMONY?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.283
- EH, I'D GIVE IT A "B".

13:03.316 --> 13:04.617
THEY READ FROM CORINTHIANS,

13:04.651 --> 13:06.353
WHICH COULDN'T
BE MORE CLICHE.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.255
THE ORCHESTRA WAS WAY TOO
UP TEMPO ON THE PROCESSIONAL.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
IT'S LIKE,
LET THE THING BREATHE.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.125
AM I RIGHT?
- YOU CAN TELL ME THE TRUTH.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.626
- OH, MY GOD,
THE WHOLE THING WAS AMAZING.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.962
A-PLUS-PLUS.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.196
I GOT THE NAME
OF THE COORDINATOR.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.197
- BRIAN.
- HIS NAME IS DARREN.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.267
- THERE HE IS.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.635
- YOU OKAY?

13:22.669 --> 13:24.204
- NEVER BEEN BETTER.
LET'S DANCE.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.805
- WHOA, I DON'T DANCE.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.174
- YOU ARE MY DATE.
YOU DANCIN'.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.043
- NO, COME--
NO--NO, I DON'T DANCE.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.378
I DON'T--

13:31.411 --> 13:33.813
- ANOTHER DRINK, MILADY?

13:33.847 --> 13:38.986
*

13:39.019 --> 13:40.653
THIS IS MY FIRST
GAY WEDDING.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.990
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.225
FIRST GAY WEDDING.
- YEAH, I HEARD.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.360
- I HAVE TO SAY, IT'S BEEN
AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.996
- THAT'S GREAT.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.064
- I MEAN, STRAIGHT WEDDINGS
ARE FUN TOO,

13:51.098 --> 13:52.499
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRA
SPECIAL GOING ON HERE TODAY.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.334
- YEAH, IT'S CALLED
AN OPEN BAR.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.302
- [chuckles]
AWESOME!

13:55.335 --> 13:56.870
FIRST GAY WEDDING JOKE.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.539
- UGH, CAN WE STOP
DANCING NOW?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.741
- HEY, LOOK, I WANNA BE
HAVING FUN WHEN JEFF SEES ME.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.410
AND I'M GONNA BE DANCING
LIKE A FREAK

14:03.443 --> 14:05.345
WHEN HE POINTS ME OUT
TO LITTLE HANK JR.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.680
RELAX. JUST DANCE TO THE BEAT.
DON'T DANCE TO THE WORDS.

14:07.714 --> 14:08.982
- THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN DOING,

14:09.016 --> 14:10.417
AND I STILL
LOOK LIKE THIS.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.885
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH MY HANDS.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.653
- OKAY, MAYBE JUST TRY
STANDING STILL.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.255
- I'M NOT GONNA BE
THE ASSHOLE

14:15.288 --> 14:17.557
STANDING STILL IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DANCE FLOOR.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.892
YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY
I'D DO THIS FOR, RIGHT?

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
- YES, YES, YES.
- OKAY.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.995
- COME TO FERNANDO.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.763
- [chuckles]

14:23.796 --> 14:26.233
- UH, I'M NOT REALLY
A DANCER.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.901
- NONSENSE.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.102
OPEN YOUR HIPS.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.770
- WHAT?

14:30.803 --> 14:33.006
- OPEN YOUR HIPS.
LIKE THIS.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.541
- EH.

14:34.574 --> 14:38.111
- RELEASE YOUR BODY
TO THE MUSIC.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.712
- [laughs]

14:39.746 --> 14:42.082
- UM, I'M NOT REAL--

14:42.115 --> 14:43.383
WHAT, YOU MEAN LIKE THAT?

14:43.416 --> 14:45.418
- YES, YES, YES, YES.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.054
SET YOUR HIPS FREE,

14:47.087 --> 14:49.289
LET THEM FLY,
LET THEM SOAR.

HOW CAN YOU HONESTLY ESPOUSE

- BECAUSE AS A GAY COP,

16:25.218 --> 16:27.487
I REALIZE NOT EVERYBODY
CAN PLAY THE GAME.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.322
IT'S LIKE BRIAN URLACHER.

SHOULD BE US

16:51.378 --> 16:54.547
FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHT
TO PARTY.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.383
- YOU'RE RIGHT, BRIAN.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.318
LET'S DANCE.

OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.322
- NO.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.557

YOUR ASS FOR SAYING THAT.

HI, I'VE HEARD
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.794
I KNOW IT WAS SHORT NOTICE,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.096
BUT I THINK IT CAME TOGETHER
PRETTY WELL, DIDN'T IT?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.597
WHO NEEDS A YEAR
TO PLAN A WEDDING?

- LISTEN, SWEETIE, LET'S PUT IT
ALL OUT ON THE TABLE HERE.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.073
WHEN I FIRST SAW A PICTURE
OF YOU IN JEFF'S PHONE,

17:54.107 --> 17:56.209
I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD,

17:56.243 --> 17:58.645
AM I JUST A STAND-IN HERE
WHEN I WANTED TO BE THE STAR?

17:58.678 --> 18:01.648
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING, BABY.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.984
HE LOVED YOU, BUT YOU WEREN'T
READY TO SETTLE DOWN.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.086
I WAS, SO TO US,
TO ME ESPECIALLY,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.821
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.991
BECAUSE OTHERWISE,
I NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.131
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WASN'T READY.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.234
- AND I WAS--
TO GET MARRIED, TO HAVE KIDS.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.436

A LITTLE CHINESE BABY, A GIRL.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.837
- OH, SWEET,
WHAT'S HER NAME?

18:24.871 --> 18:26.105
- WE WANNA CALL HER
BY HER GIVEN NAME,

18:26.139 --> 18:27.974
WHICH IS HO-WAN-HO.

A GOOD GIRL'S NAME?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.580
COLLEEN.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.582
- OH, I LIKE THAT.
IT'S EASY TO PRONOUNCE.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.017
EVERY TIME I TRY TO SAY
HER NAME, I GET A HAIRBALL.

18:38.050 --> 18:39.452

THIS ATTITUDE,

18:48.060 --> 18:50.263
AS IF THIS WAS ALL ABOUT ME.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.081
AVOID STRENUOUS ACTIVITY
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
