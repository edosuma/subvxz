00:01.936 --> 00:03.836
<i>So, here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> glee:<i> Rachel got kitty</i>

00:03.838 --> 00:05.671
<i>To rejoin the glee club, and</i>
<i>spencer just joined on his own.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:07.306
<i>But anyway, the new directions!</i>
<i>Were really good</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:08.941
<i>And they won</i>
<i>sue's weird invitational.</i>

00:08.943 --> 00:12.044
They were sitting on stools,
singing in unison.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.679
<i>Something's definitely going on</i>
<i>between rachel and sam,</i>

00:13.681 --> 00:15.280
<i>'cause, like, they were</i>
<i>hanging out and they kissed,</i>

00:15.282 --> 00:17.216
<i>But it could have something</i>
<i>to do with sue hypnotizing him.</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:19.952
<i>Santana and brittany</i>
<i>are engaged and in love,</i>

00:19.954 --> 00:21.520
<i>But santana's still</i>
<i>super bummed about the time</i>

00:21.522 --> 00:24.189
<i>She came out and her grandma</i>
<i>disowned her. Boo.</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:25.724
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>you missed on</i> glee.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.461
(à la elvis presley):
Hey there, baby.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.296
Ambition is a dream
with a v-8 engine.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.465
Do you start every conversation
with an impression?

00:33.467 --> 00:35.467
Uh, it's the world's
greatest icebreaker, yes.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.468
What's up?

00:36.470 --> 00:37.536
Um, i just remembered

00:37.538 --> 00:38.804
We talked about
getting together this week.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.139
Oh, yeah, is
that still on?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.140
Uh, yeah.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.307
I mean, unless
you want to cancel

00:42.309 --> 00:43.509
Or reschedule.
Do you want
to cancel or...?

00:43.511 --> 00:45.177
I mean, i just...
No, i...

00:45.179 --> 00:47.046
I just,
you know...

00:47.048 --> 00:48.814
Later today,
after school?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.616
Breadstix.
Um...
Cool.

00:52.520 --> 00:55.154
(dionne warwick's "i'll never
fall in love again" begins)

00:55.156 --> 00:58.357
¶ what do you get
when you fall in love? ¶

00:58.359 --> 01:02.061
¶ a guy with a pin
to burst your bubble ¶

01:02.063 --> 01:05.497
¶ that's what you get
for all your trouble ¶

01:05.499 --> 01:07.499
¶ i'll... ¶

01:07.501 --> 01:13.105
¶ i'll never fall
in love again ¶

01:13.107 --> 01:17.309
¶ i'll never
fall in love again ¶

01:19.180 --> 01:22.381
¶ what do you do
when you kiss a girl? ¶

01:22.383 --> 01:26.418
¶ you get enough germs
to catch pneumonia ¶

01:26.420 --> 01:29.955
¶ after you do,
she'll never phone you ¶

01:29.957 --> 01:31.757
¶ i'll... ¶

01:31.759 --> 01:36.228
¶ never fall in love again ¶

01:36.230 --> 01:39.865
¶ don't you know that
i'll never fall in love again ¶

01:42.069 --> 01:45.971
¶ don't tell me
what's it all about ¶

01:45.973 --> 01:50.576
¶ 'cause i've been there
and i'm glad i'm out ¶

01:50.578 --> 01:54.213
Both: ¶ out of those chains,
those chains that bind you ¶

01:54.215 --> 01:57.883
¶ that is why
i'm here to remind you ¶

01:57.885 --> 02:00.819
¶ what do you get
when you fall in love? ¶

02:00.821 --> 02:04.056
¶ you only get lies
and pain and sorrow ¶

02:04.058 --> 02:08.393
¶ so for at least
until tomorrow ¶

02:08.395 --> 02:09.962
¶ i'll... ¶

02:09.964 --> 02:14.500
¶ i'll never fall
in love again ¶

02:14.502 --> 02:17.169
¶ don't you know that i'll ¶

02:17.171 --> 02:21.807

in love again ¶

02:21.809 --> 02:24.576
¶ i'll... ¶

02:24.578 --> 02:27.913
¶ never fall in love ¶

02:27.915 --> 02:35.154
¶ again. ¶

02:44.131 --> 02:46.131
(knocking at door)

02:46.133 --> 02:47.599
Mother:
Brittany? Sweetie?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.101
What is it, mom?

02:49.103 --> 02:51.370
Your father and i would
like to talk to you.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.173
Sorry to bother you, sweetie.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.374
It's okay.
Mother:
Hey.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.642
What are you
working on?

02:56.644 --> 02:57.843
Brittany:
Trying to find a euler brick

02:57.845 --> 02:59.778
Whose face diagonal
is also an integer.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.013
I'm sorry?

03:01.015 --> 03:02.614
Well, a euler brick is a cuboid

03:02.616 --> 03:04.616
That possesses integer edges a,
which is greater than b,

03:04.618 --> 03:05.784
Which is greater than c,

03:05.786 --> 03:07.786
And face
diagonals

03:07.788 --> 03:10.122
Dab, dac and dbc.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.124
Ooh, the integer's
giving me a headache.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.225
Mmm.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.226
Uh, honey...

03:14.228 --> 03:16.995
Uh, s-sweetie,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.897
Um, i was just
wondering, uh...

03:18.899 --> 03:22.134
Have you ever wondered
how you ended up

03:22.136 --> 03:23.735
A mathematical
genius?

03:23.737 --> 03:27.039
You know, even though
i'm of average intelligence

03:27.041 --> 03:29.708
And your father is of
below average intelligence?

03:29.710 --> 03:30.976
(chuckles):
Yeah.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.477
I'm really not a smart man.

03:32.479 --> 03:35.414
I mean, he's got an iq
of 60, so he should only

03:35.416 --> 03:37.749
Be allowed to harvest vegetables

03:37.751 --> 03:39.685
Or repair furniture.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.987
See, i have
an iq of 60, so...

03:41.989 --> 03:43.855
I just said that.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.990
Anyway, honey,

03:44.992 --> 03:47.025
Your father and i
have talked it over,

03:47.027 --> 03:48.660
And we have decided
that it's time

03:48.662 --> 03:50.429
For you to know
the truth.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.331
And you may find it a
little bit shocking...

03:52.333 --> 03:53.999
What... What is it?
What...
What is it?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.834
Pierce is not
your real father.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.002
What?
What?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.337
What are...

03:58.339 --> 03:59.538
We talked about this.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.240
When?
We talked...

04:01.242 --> 04:02.841
We talked every...
Every day

04:02.843 --> 04:04.743
For about 19 years.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.579
Oh...

04:07.581 --> 04:08.914
I remember.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.349
(sighs)
brittany,

04:10.351 --> 04:11.850
I'm not your real father.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.118
Who is my real father, then?

04:13.120 --> 04:14.019
Yeah, who's her real father?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.654
Your real father...

04:16.557 --> 04:18.056
...Is dr. Stephen hawking.

04:18.058 --> 04:18.724
(gasps)

04:18.726 --> 04:20.058
The robot.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.293
What?
He's not a robot.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.195
Pierce and i, we
went to england

04:23.197 --> 04:24.396
On our honeymoon,

04:24.398 --> 04:26.398
And that's when
pierce told me

04:26.400 --> 04:28.267
That he-- and i'm
quoting him--

04:28.269 --> 04:31.270
He said,
"i am sterile,

04:31.272 --> 04:32.771
And i can't
have kids."

04:32.773 --> 04:34.606
Oh, mom.
What he really
meant was,

04:34.608 --> 04:36.375
"i am virile,

04:36.377 --> 04:37.709
And i can't wait
to have kids."

04:37.711 --> 04:39.044
Mom!

04:39.046 --> 04:40.379
(laughing):
That's classic.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.114
That sounds like something
<i>i</i> would say.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.116
You did say that.
Copy that.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.884
Oh, mom...
Anyway,

04:45.886 --> 04:48.053
I cried
and i ran,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.788
And i ended up
going to a pub

04:49.790 --> 04:50.889
And getting drunk,

04:50.891 --> 04:52.157
And i looked over,
and i saw

04:52.159 --> 04:53.892
Two little wheels

04:53.894 --> 04:55.927
Underneath the stall,

04:55.929 --> 04:58.730
And i ended up having sex
with stephen hawking.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.265
(exhales)
and nine months later,

05:00.267 --> 05:01.166
I got you,

05:01.168 --> 05:02.901
In a indiana barn.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.636
(sniffs)
and i want
you to know

05:04.638 --> 05:05.971
That i'm still your dad,

05:05.973 --> 05:07.306
Even though
i'm not your dad,

05:07.308 --> 05:09.841
And i will always
be your dad.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.010
Okay.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.312
Yeah, and this is just like...

05:13.314 --> 05:14.513
It's just a little shocking.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.514
Oh, i know.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.748
And you know what?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.984
I'm sorry that you
had to wait so long

05:18.986 --> 05:19.985
To hear this.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.153
Okay, well, mom and dad?

05:21.155 --> 05:22.621
Um... I have some news, so...

05:22.623 --> 05:24.589
Uh-oh.
No, no, it's great.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.625
Santana and i
are getting married.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.959
Oh!
Oh...

05:27.961 --> 05:28.960
You see?

05:28.962 --> 05:30.762
These girls!

05:30.764 --> 05:32.464
Santana?
Oh, my gosh!

05:32.466 --> 05:34.433
That's fantastic!

05:34.435 --> 05:36.735
(school bell ringing)

05:45.946 --> 05:47.346
Sam, i'm sorry.
Rachel, i'm sorry.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.014
What are you
sorry for?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.015
Um, for blowing
off our date.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.116
Well, i blew off
our date.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.517
Me, too! I...

05:52.519 --> 05:54.186
Well, look, i know we talked
about just going as friends,

05:54.188 --> 05:55.620
But then...

05:55.622 --> 05:56.788
Look, i'll admit it, rachel.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.290
I have a...
A little thing for you,

05:58.292 --> 05:59.291
And with a
nudge or two,

05:59.293 --> 06:00.625
It could probably grow
into a big thing.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.693
But there's, like,
a huge part of me

06:01.695 --> 06:03.061
That has a bigger thing
for mercedes, so i...

06:03.063 --> 06:04.696
Look, i'd be lying
if i didn't say

06:04.698 --> 06:06.064
That i have feelings
for you, too.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.566
It's just that
i have more important things

06:07.568 --> 06:09.568
To focus on,
like teaching these young kids.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.836
Oh, my god.
I am supposed to be teaching

06:10.838 --> 06:12.304
Health class right now.
Okay? I am so sorry.

06:12.306 --> 06:13.705
I gotta go.
Uh, i love you, rachel. Bye.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.774
Okay. Love you.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.210
(school bell ringing)

06:18.212 --> 06:19.644
Hello, winners!

06:19.646 --> 06:21.146
I don't know about you guys,
but i'm still basking

06:21.148 --> 06:22.581
In the glow of our first

06:22.583 --> 06:24.516
Of many championship trophies.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.817
Kurt:
Well, rachel and i

06:25.819 --> 06:28.253
Want our champions to celebrate
another champion.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.154
Katniss everdeen!

06:29.156 --> 06:30.756
Close.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.157
Burt bacharach.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.825
This is a good time
to go to the bathroom

06:33.827 --> 06:34.926
Or get a snack.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.261
Kurt: Burt bacharach
has written 73--

06:36.263 --> 06:38.663
Count 'em, 73-- top 40 hits.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.166
He's also won three oscars,
two golden globes,

06:41.168 --> 06:42.934
A-a boatload of grammys,

06:42.936 --> 06:44.436
And his music has been
featured on everything

06:44.438 --> 06:45.937
From<i> the simpsons</i> to<i> goodfellas.</i>

06:45.939 --> 06:48.173
And you can't help but grin
when you listen to his music.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.241
His songs are uplifting

06:49.243 --> 06:51.009
And theatrical
and optimistic.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.411
Kurt: We need to soak up
all his uplifting energy

06:52.413 --> 06:54.346
As we get ready
for sectionals.

06:54.348 --> 06:57.215
Which are five weeks away,
but i guarantee you,

06:57.217 --> 06:59.184
Vocal adrenaline
and the warblers

06:59.186 --> 07:01.086
Are doing everything
in their power to regain

07:01.088 --> 07:02.721
Their former glory.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.189
But fear not,

07:04.191 --> 07:06.858
Because we have
a secret weapon.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.194
Is that my cue?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.196
(cheering)
diva!

07:11.198 --> 07:12.531
Yes, i am here to mentor you,

07:12.533 --> 07:13.899
And yes, these might be
real diamonds,

07:13.901 --> 07:15.434
And yes,

07:15.436 --> 07:17.202
My single "shakin' my head"

07:17.204 --> 07:18.537
Is number 89
on itunes.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.138
Ooh...

07:20.140 --> 07:21.373
So, which one of you

07:21.375 --> 07:22.874
Wants me to mentor you?

07:22.876 --> 07:23.975
Somebody famous.
Me, me, me.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.811
Me.
Oh, my god!

07:25.813 --> 07:26.878
(school bell ringing)

07:26.880 --> 07:28.814
So, let's get to it.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.383
What's going on
between you and sam?

07:31.385 --> 07:33.051
We...
Nothing.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.719
I mean, why?
What did... What did you hear?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.888
If the olympics
had a gossip event,

07:36.890 --> 07:38.390
Kurt hummel would be mark spitz.

07:38.392 --> 07:41.092
We were supposed
to go out on a date,

07:41.094 --> 07:42.561
But both of us bailed

07:42.563 --> 07:43.895
Because neither of us
wanted to hurt you.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.231
Mercedes jones
has seen paris, okay?

07:46.233 --> 07:47.332
(laughs)

07:47.334 --> 07:48.900
No, i-i-i love sam,

07:48.902 --> 07:49.901
But we're just friends.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.269
Plus, we already talked
about this.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.804
It's time for you
to get back out there.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.306
I'll think about it.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.009
You know, it feels
super weird

07:58.011 --> 07:59.511
Being in here.
Mmm. I know.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.913
I used to feel that way,
but then i got used to it.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.415
Yeah, well, i'm all for
what you're doing here,

08:03.417 --> 08:04.749
As long as it's a part of

08:04.751 --> 08:06.084
The rachel berry
rebuilding project.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.019
Because we both know
that soon enough,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.288
You're gonna have to go
back to where you belong.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.523
New york. Broadway.

08:11.525 --> 08:12.691
Why are you getting
so worked up about it?

08:12.693 --> 08:13.692
I'm gonna go back.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.026
I know you are,

08:15.028 --> 08:16.495
Because at my lunch yesterday
with russell simmons,

08:16.497 --> 08:17.929
He told me about
a new broadway show

08:17.931 --> 08:18.930
His friend is
producing.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.832
It's a new,
original musical.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.534
They're holding auditions
on friday,

08:22.536 --> 08:23.535
And you're going.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.936
There is absolutely no way

08:24.938 --> 08:26.705
I'm going to get an audition.
Really?

08:26.707 --> 08:28.940
Because i had russell call
and get you one,

08:28.942 --> 08:30.876
So what are you gonna sing?

08:33.046 --> 08:36.281
No, i'm not...
I'm not ready to go back there.

08:37.951 --> 08:38.950
(sighs)

08:38.952 --> 08:40.452
You want to know
what the best thing is

08:40.454 --> 08:41.686
About having our gift?

08:42.723 --> 08:44.022
It's always there,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.390
Like a good friend.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.058
You know, when you open
your mouth, there it is.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.960
But these kids...
You're doing god's
work here, okay?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.195
Nobody's trying
to stop that.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.463
But they're not
going to sectionals

08:51.465 --> 08:52.631
For another five weeks.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.200
And i can tell you
that nothing feels right

08:55.202 --> 08:56.535
If rachel berry
isn't in front

08:56.537 --> 08:58.136
Of an audience somewhere,

08:58.138 --> 09:00.939
Killing it six nights a week
and twice on sunday.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.642
I'm just scared.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.043
I know you are, girl.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.845
And that's why i set up

09:06.847 --> 09:09.147
A little old-school inspiration
for you in the auditorium.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.215
(laughs)

09:10.217 --> 09:12.450
¶ sha la la la la ¶

09:14.388 --> 09:16.922

09:24.932 --> 09:26.932

¶ it's not the way you kiss ¶

09:29.436 --> 09:31.336
¶ that tears me apart ¶

09:32.940 --> 09:34.673
¶ whoa-ho-ho ¶

10:11.378 --> 10:14.312

¶ what can i do ¶

10:52.252 --> 10:57.889

11:00.594 --> 11:01.826
Thank you, mercedes.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.528
Hey, even mentors
need mentors.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.196
I appreciate it.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.198
And you're right,
i do miss new york.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.034
I think about being
in my dressing room

11:09.036 --> 11:10.769
And listening to the
crowd settling in.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.772
But i just...

11:13.774 --> 11:15.173
I can't.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.343
I can't do it.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.618
Welcome to my bedroom.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.952
I've been
in here before.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.288
We dated for, like,
three months.
Uh, i think

11:30.290 --> 11:32.891
I would have remembered if i
dated a guy with glasses, okay?
(purrs)

11:32.893 --> 11:33.992
I have a question.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.994
I would like
to hire you

11:35.996 --> 11:37.862
To be santana's and
my wedding planner.

11:38.699 --> 11:39.698
For free.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.032
Wow.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.634
I'm honored.
Great.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.135
But why me?
Partially

11:44.137 --> 11:45.637
Because it felt like you've
had nothing to do all year.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.872
And also because
you're a director.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.741
And i thought you could really
help me bring my vision to life.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.443
Okay, pitch it to me.
Okay.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.914
I made a list of all the things
that remind me of santana

11:55.916 --> 11:58.149
Because i thought one of
them could be a great theme.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.250
Okay, what are they?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.251
(sighs)

12:00.253 --> 12:01.886
Scissors.
Uh-uh.

12:01.888 --> 12:04.089
Sweet lady-kisses?
No.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.157
Tuna.
(meows)

12:06.159 --> 12:07.659
Lord tubbington
snuck that one in.

12:07.661 --> 12:09.961
Okay. Heaven.
Wait.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.099
Elaborate.
(sighs)
well, uh...

12:14.101 --> 12:17.202
When i'm with santana, it just
feels like i'm in heaven, and...

12:17.204 --> 12:18.670
(dusty springfield's
"wishin' and hopin'" begins)

12:18.672 --> 12:19.938
...Angel wings
remind me of her.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.507
Okay, let's
explore heaven.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.641
(meows)

12:26.012 --> 12:28.012
¶ wishin' and hopin' ¶

12:28.014 --> 12:30.115
¶ and thinkin' and prayin' ¶

12:30.117 --> 12:32.183
¶ plannin' and dreamin' ¶

12:32.185 --> 12:35.186
¶ each night of her charms ¶

12:35.188 --> 12:39.691
¶ that won't get you
into her arms ¶

12:39.693 --> 12:43.194
¶ so if you're lookin'
to find love ¶

12:43.196 --> 12:48.133
¶ you can share... ¶

12:48.135 --> 12:50.602
¶ all you got to do
is hold her ¶

12:50.604 --> 12:53.104
¶ and kiss her and love her ¶

12:53.106 --> 12:57.609
¶ and show her that you care ¶

12:57.611 --> 13:00.145
¶ show her that you care ¶

13:00.147 --> 13:02.080
¶ just for her ¶

13:02.082 --> 13:03.948
¶ do the things ¶

13:03.950 --> 13:06.151
¶ she likes to do ¶

13:06.153 --> 13:08.386
¶ wear your hair ¶

13:08.388 --> 13:10.221
¶ just for her ¶

13:10.223 --> 13:11.890
¶ 'cause... ¶

13:11.892 --> 13:13.725
¶ you won't get her ¶

13:13.727 --> 13:15.927
¶ thinkin' and a-prayin' ¶

13:15.929 --> 13:18.163
¶ wishin' and a-hopin' ¶

13:18.165 --> 13:19.964
¶ 'cause wishin' and hopin' ¶

13:19.966 --> 13:22.567
¶ and thinkin' and prayin' ¶

13:22.569 --> 13:24.235
¶ plannin' and dreamin' ¶

13:24.237 --> 13:27.739
¶ her kisses will start ¶

13:27.741 --> 13:29.407
¶ that won't get you ¶

13:29.409 --> 13:32.177
¶ into her heart ¶
¶<i> ah-ooh</i> ¶

13:32.179 --> 13:36.314
¶ so if you're thinkin'
about how great ¶

13:36.316 --> 13:40.652
¶ true love is... ¶

13:40.654 --> 13:42.287
¶ all you gotta do is ¶

13:42.289 --> 13:43.922
¶ hold her and kiss her ¶

13:43.924 --> 13:45.590
¶ and squeeze her and love her ¶

13:45.592 --> 13:49.260
¶ yeah, just do it,
and after you do ¶

13:49.262 --> 13:52.697
¶ you will be hers ¶

13:53.667 --> 13:57.235
¶ you will be hers ¶

13:58.205 --> 14:02.841
¶ you will be hers... ¶

14:10.784 --> 14:13.618
I think heaven may be the
perfect theme for this wedding.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.787
Yeah, or not.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.288
Let's keep it
on the list.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.857
I still think the
underworld could be cool.

14:18.859 --> 14:19.958
Let's think
about that.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.059
(school bell ringing)

14:21.061 --> 14:22.727
Sorry to break up
your boy time, boys.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.063
But we have a crisis, and
i need to recruit you guys.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.464
It's rachel. Now, we all know
that she needed

14:26.466 --> 14:28.700
To come back here and lick
her wounds, and i think

14:28.702 --> 14:31.135
It's great that she got the glee
club up and running again...

14:31.137 --> 14:33.304
(clears throat)
and you're doing
a great job, too, kurt,

14:33.306 --> 14:35.139
With, you know,
whatever your thesis is.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.641
But what i
do know is--

14:36.643 --> 14:38.743
Rachel's destiny is bigger
than this place.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.712
And it's not just that
she's scared to try again,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.313
It's almost like
she's forgotten that.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.315
Yeah, but how
are we...
How are...

14:44.317 --> 14:46.818
How are we supposed
to remind her?
Yeah.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.152
Well, we have
to make her homesick.

14:48.154 --> 14:49.487
But isn't she
home now?

14:49.489 --> 14:50.989
We need to make her homesick
for new york.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.223
It's where she belongs.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.659
Artie is already in, and
i put in a call to blaine.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.227
I'm sorry if that's
awkward for you, kurt.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.029
But if you guys will follow me.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.430
Okay.
Yeah.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.833
Okay...
(school bell ringing)

15:01.835 --> 15:03.935
Santana: Britt, i think
that we can invite them,

15:03.937 --> 15:06.170
But i don't really think
that johnny weir

15:06.172 --> 15:08.573
And joan baez
are gonna come.
Hmm.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.741
Between you and me, though,

15:09.743 --> 15:11.676
That lady was the best
"sexter" i've ever had.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.012
Uh, why are you
inviting my<i> abuela?</i>

15:14.014 --> 15:16.014
Because you won't, and
she should be there.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.282
You know,

15:17.284 --> 15:20.218
When i was little, we used
to play wedding all the time.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.620
She would give me
her veil,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.757
And i would wrap her shawl
around me like a dress,

15:25.759 --> 15:27.859
I would march
down the aisle,

15:27.861 --> 15:29.694
And she would hum
the wedding march.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.195
And then she would ask me

15:31.197 --> 15:32.931
What guy i was gonna
marry that day.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.468
My whole life,
i've dreamt of my wedding

15:37.470 --> 15:40.505
With her sitting
in the front row, bawling.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.241
And-and believe me,

15:43.243 --> 15:46.244
If i could get in her head
and bring her into this century,

15:46.246 --> 15:48.746
I would, and i would
forgive her and have her here.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.415
She's my<i> abuela,</i> you know,

15:50.417 --> 15:52.717
Like the lady with the
big plates of rice and beans.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.119
(chuckles)
of course.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.121
But last i heard,
she was on facebook,

15:57.123 --> 15:58.289
Posting about
her diverticulitis,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.657
Trolling for sympathy.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.426
See, it's even more
important-- she's sick.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.427
No, britt, she can't poop.

16:02.429 --> 16:03.761
And i don't think
that's gonna kill her.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.229
Tell that to fat elvis.

16:05.231 --> 16:06.531
(meows)

16:07.500 --> 16:09.167
But, um...

16:09.169 --> 16:12.837
Having her at my wedding
means not marrying you.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.839
And i'd choose you
over everyone.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.574
I choose you, too.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.510
(doorbell rings)

16:20.480 --> 16:21.579
Yes?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.581
Hi, um, abuela lopez?

16:23.583 --> 16:25.083
I'm brittany.
The agency sent me.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.084
I'm your new nurse.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.285
Uh, what agency?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.519
Uh, you know, is
it okay if i just,

16:28.521 --> 16:29.520
Like, go ahead and
set up inside?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.521
Uh...
Yeah.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.856
You look great,
by the way.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.524
You could be peter pan,
except in, like,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.159
A retirement home
production sort of way.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.227
I know a guy.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.003
I'll pick up the new dosage
in an hour.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.170
Thanks, dr. Walgreens.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.338
(chuckles)

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
Now, should we talk
about your stool?

16:49.142 --> 16:50.975
I am sorry, uh, brittany?

16:50.977 --> 16:52.777
Uh, i don't feel
comfortable

16:52.779 --> 16:54.779
With having a stranger
in my home.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.381
Or talking about my stool.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.521
But i'm afraid i...

17:03.523 --> 17:05.523
Oh, but i'm so
sorry to interrupt,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.859
But, um, i never
miss my telenovelas.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.594
You-you don't mind, do you?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.297
(sighs)

17:13.299 --> 17:16.000
That guy is a bastard.
Mmm.

17:16.002 --> 17:17.001
Ugh.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.503
He's still not
wearing a shirt.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.904
Mmm, i see, yeah.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.906
(chuckles)

17:21.908 --> 17:23.574
Oh.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.143
Is your husband
a good man?

17:25.145 --> 17:26.677
Well, i'm only engaged.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.513
(gasps)
brittany.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.847
Oh,

17:29.849 --> 17:32.083
Young love is
a treasure.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.186
Is there fire
and passion?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.654
I popped a hip once.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.655
Oh!

17:37.657 --> 17:38.656
That makes
a difference.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.824
(both laughing)

17:39.826 --> 17:41.225
You must tell me
all about it.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.927
How you met,

17:42.929 --> 17:44.595
Will you have
any children,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.364
How soon will you
have them, how many?

17:46.366 --> 17:48.766
I'm going to make us a huge
pile of rice and beans.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.768
Actually, i thought
maybe, um...

17:50.770 --> 17:52.336
We could go out
for some fresh air,

17:52.338 --> 17:53.905
Maybe some... Fondue?

17:53.907 --> 17:55.840
¶ queso por dos ¶
hey!

17:55.842 --> 17:57.775
¶ queso por dos ¶
¶<i> es un plato caliente</i> ¶

17:57.777 --> 18:00.378
¶ queso por dos. ¶

18:00.380 --> 18:04.449
<i>Hola.</i> Welcome to<i> queso por dos,</i>
which i just sold to univision.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.952
Tonight's special<i> invitado,</i>
señora abuela lopez.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.288
Thank you for leaving
your musty hoarder home

18:10.290 --> 18:11.856
And taking three
buses to get here.

18:11.858 --> 18:12.857
Ah.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.025
My mouth is burning.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.359
Oh,<i> gracias.</i>

18:15.361 --> 18:16.360
It's got a mean kick.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.362
Just like you.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.797
Lord and lady
tubbington,

18:19.799 --> 18:21.532
That piñata's
for our guests.
(meows)

18:21.534 --> 18:23.134
As america knows,

18:23.136 --> 18:24.635
I'm getting
married soon.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.637
So the only thing that's
on my mind is weddings.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.806
Oh, and learning
that stephen hawking is my dad.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.142
So tonight's show is
all about weddings.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.277
And, if there's time,
stephen hawking.

18:33.279 --> 18:36.714
Question-- how did you meet
your dead husband, señor lopez?

18:36.716 --> 18:41.052
Ah, hector lopez and i,
alma lopez,

18:41.054 --> 18:43.421
Were childhood sweethearts.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.723
And then he went
to vietnam and died.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.825
Which was sad
but wonderful

18:47.827 --> 18:50.661
Because then i met pedro lopez,

18:50.663 --> 18:53.464
Who ended up being
the true love of my life.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.066
Oh, that is exactly

18:55.068 --> 18:57.335
Like me and my fiancée,
except for the vietnam part.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.671
(gasps) speaking
of american history, fun fact--

19:00.673 --> 19:04.575
First lady eleanor roosevelt had
a best friend lorena hickok.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.743
They vacationed together,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.745
Wrote over 3,000 letters
to each other,

19:07.747 --> 19:10.748
And, legend has it,
eleanor kissed lorena's picture

19:10.750 --> 19:12.016
Every night before bed.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.018
Your cats are reading.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.353
(purring)

19:15.355 --> 19:16.754
Brittany:
Oh, abuela,

19:16.756 --> 19:18.456
Planning a wedding
can be so much work.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.124
Maybe my fiancée
and i should just elope.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.125
Ah!

19:21.127 --> 19:22.960
If you do that,
i'll skin you alive.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.195
When two souls
unite as one,

19:24.197 --> 19:26.464
It is a day
of celebration.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.467
You should be surrounded
by your loved ones,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.369
Especially<i> tu familia.</i>

19:31.371 --> 19:35.039
Friends come and go,
but family is your blood.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.009
And they need
to share in your joy.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.844
Brittany:
Beautifully said.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.912
Alma:
Thank you.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.550
Rachel:
Mercedes.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.986
I told you i came here
to mentor and to guide.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.988
(sighs)

19:50.990 --> 19:52.323
New york is endgame
for you, rachel.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.491
It just is.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.693
You know, sometimes
you need a little bit

19:55.695 --> 19:58.462
Of inspiration to remind
you and light the way.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.265
(christopher cross'
"arthur's theme" begins)

20:12.745 --> 20:16.247
¶ once in your life
you'll find her ¶

20:16.249 --> 20:19.750
¶ someone who turns

¶ is fall in love ¶

21:13.873 --> 21:16.874

¶ he's showing himself

22:15.868 --> 22:17.435
(song ends, applause)

22:18.604 --> 22:20.037
(clears throat)

22:20.039 --> 22:22.606
So, what did you think?

22:22.608 --> 22:24.942
Look, you guys,

22:24.944 --> 22:27.778
Uh, despite your valiant effort,

22:27.780 --> 22:30.314
I just,
i'm not ready to go back.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.982
Mercedes:
Well,

22:31.984 --> 22:34.452
I am not leaving
until you are.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.728
(students chattering)

22:51.504 --> 22:52.803
Excuse me, excuse me.

22:52.805 --> 22:53.871
What are you doing?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.740
I'm meeting my latino fans.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.979
Okay, you know what,
we need to talk.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.647
Right now.<i> Afuera.</i>

23:04.650 --> 23:06.484
Go on.
Thanks, guys.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.486
Don't be mad at me.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.755
Why do you think that it's okay
to go behind my back

23:10.757 --> 23:12.556
And be friends with someone
who would rather see me dead

23:12.558 --> 23:13.758
Than in love with another woman?

23:13.760 --> 23:15.359
You came out to abuela
ten years ago, okay?

23:15.361 --> 23:16.427
Times have changed.

23:16.429 --> 23:18.028
It was three years ago,

23:18.030 --> 23:19.530
And nothing has changed for her,

23:19.532 --> 23:21.098
And it never will.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.267
And believe me,
it's not just the homos

23:23.269 --> 23:25.569
That she has a problem with,
because it took that bitch

23:25.571 --> 23:27.338
50 years to talk
to a black person,

23:27.340 --> 23:29.173
And it was her mailman,

23:29.175 --> 23:31.609
And then she accused him
of stealing her christmas cards.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.010
Well, did he?

23:33.012 --> 23:34.278
No.

23:34.280 --> 23:35.913
Look, either mr. Shue
or rosie o'donnell

23:35.915 --> 23:37.214
Once said, "people are afraid

23:37.216 --> 23:38.516
Of what they don't know."

23:38.518 --> 23:40.117
Okay, i used to be afraid
of greek yogurt,

23:40.119 --> 23:42.686
And then once i added a box
of sugar, it kind of grew on me.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.889
Maybe it's our job

23:44.891 --> 23:47.958
As young, hot progressives
to educate older, scary farts.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.127
I mean, if abuela
gets to know us

23:50.129 --> 23:51.629
And sees that
we're somewhat normal,

23:51.631 --> 23:53.364
Like how i sometimes dance
in my sleep

23:53.366 --> 23:55.266
And how you sometimes dye
your hair blonde for no reason,

23:55.268 --> 23:59.370
Then she'll see us
for who we really are, okay?

23:59.372 --> 24:02.139
And then maybe
she'll understand that, um,

24:02.141 --> 24:04.041
Aside from the awesome
lesbian sex part,

24:04.043 --> 24:06.377
That we're-we're just like
everybody else.

24:06.379 --> 24:08.112
We at least have to try, right?

24:08.114 --> 24:09.914
Okay.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.081
Do you want a signed picture?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.083
Please?
I'm sure you do.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.618
We should, um,
print up our wedding menus

24:14.620 --> 24:15.719
On the back of that.
Yay!

24:15.721 --> 24:16.720
<i>Queso por dos.</i>

24:16.722 --> 24:17.922
(laughter)

24:17.924 --> 24:19.824
(sighs)

24:19.826 --> 24:21.392
Did i ever tell you
that i love you?

24:21.394 --> 24:22.726
Tell me again.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.261
I love you.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.630
I love you.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.333
(carpenters' "(they long to be)
close to you" begins)

24:36.175 --> 24:39.076
¶ why do birds ¶

¶ and starlight in your eyes ¶

¶ of blue ¶

26:11.270 --> 26:13.203
That was beautiful, sam,

26:13.205 --> 26:14.405
But isn't that song

26:14.407 --> 26:16.073
A little romantic to be singing
to your friend?

26:16.075 --> 26:17.374
Oh, come on,
we're not just friends.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.609
Um, yeah, we are.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.778
We broke up months ago.
Okay, well, it's kind of

26:20.780 --> 26:22.179
A hard transition
to just being friends.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.380
You know, like, two minutes ago,

26:23.382 --> 26:25.015
It was cool
if i touched your boobs,

26:25.017 --> 26:27.351
But then we break up,
and then it's not, and then...

26:27.353 --> 26:29.219
But you've been
dating people, right?

26:29.221 --> 26:30.921
I mean, you're going
out with girls,

26:30.923 --> 26:33.524
I assumed, and you just
weren't telling me.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.626
No, no, i-i wouldn't lie to you
about that.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.596
Actually, i thought
that if i did,

26:38.598 --> 26:40.998
It would hurt you and
we wouldn't be friends anymore.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.300
Sam.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.135
You're sweet.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.203
Okay, but you have to trust

26:46.205 --> 26:47.371
That our friendship

26:47.373 --> 26:48.906
Is stronger than that.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.975
You have to believe
that we really love each other.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.077
Here, i'll show you.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.113
So, i've been seeing someone.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.214
No, i've been

26:57.216 --> 26:58.616
Seeing a couple of people,

26:58.618 --> 27:00.551
But this guy seems
to be really cool.

27:00.553 --> 27:01.752
Uh, we met at the bet awards,

27:01.754 --> 27:03.454
And he's a christian
rock singer,

27:03.456 --> 27:05.255
And he's saving himself
until marriage, too.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.590
Hmm.
So...

27:06.592 --> 27:08.258
How does that make you feel?

27:08.260 --> 27:09.793
Uh...

27:09.795 --> 27:11.095
A little jealous,

27:11.097 --> 27:12.329
But i guess

27:12.331 --> 27:13.731
Mostly happy for you.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.432
See, that proves that

27:15.434 --> 27:17.134
We've moved
into the friend zone.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.003
And it also proves
that you need to get out

27:19.005 --> 27:20.170
Into the dating world,

27:20.172 --> 27:21.905
And yes, i am talking
about rachel berry.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.808
So you're not, like, bummed out
about me and her giving it a go?

27:24.810 --> 27:27.077
I need you to help heal
her heart.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.445
And yes,

27:28.447 --> 27:30.180
If it makes you feel any better,

27:30.182 --> 27:31.582
I am a little bit jealous.

27:31.584 --> 27:32.750
There we go, that's what i want.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.951
I just wanted to hear
that you were jealous.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.819
(chuckles)
so, um,

27:35.821 --> 27:38.422
Is this, uh,

27:38.424 --> 27:40.257
This christian rock guy,

27:40.259 --> 27:41.959
Is he

27:41.961 --> 27:43.961
"bigger than me"?

27:43.963 --> 27:46.430
Well, yeah, they call him tank,
so what do you think?

27:46.432 --> 27:48.499
(groans)
i'm sorry, sam,

27:48.501 --> 27:50.768
But your little white boy booty
was just an outlier.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.037
Mercedes jones is all
about that bass.

27:53.039 --> 27:54.438
I'm not ready for that.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.939
I am not ready for, uh,

27:55.941 --> 27:58.108
To be one-upped by a tank.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.343
(laughs)

27:59.345 --> 28:01.111
(school bell ringing)

28:01.113 --> 28:02.346
(muttering)

28:02.348 --> 28:03.347
Mercedes, you're here!

28:03.349 --> 28:05.049
Uh, yeah, you texted me,
like, ten times.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.283
What's going on?

28:06.285 --> 28:07.951
I need you to take over
the glee club for me.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.153
You're not going anytime soon,
are you?

28:09.155 --> 28:11.055
No, but isn't that
what kurt is for?

28:11.057 --> 28:12.790
Kurt, yes, uh, kurt,
he's, he's great.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.291
He's my rock,
he's my best friend.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.459
It's just that, you know,

28:15.461 --> 28:16.727
I think that he works better
when he collaborates.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.829
I don't want all the kids
singing "into the woods"

28:18.831 --> 28:20.864
And paula cole this week, so
you'll just keep them in check?

28:20.866 --> 28:22.366
And i'll be back soon, okay?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.301
Is everything okay?

28:25.971 --> 28:27.504
You're doing it?

28:27.506 --> 28:28.872
You're doing it? Oh, my god!

28:28.874 --> 28:30.174
Rachel, i knew that you would.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.342
You are going to kill
this audition.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.244
I just want to say thank
you for what you said

28:34.246 --> 28:35.512
And for what you sang.

28:35.514 --> 28:38.382
(choking up): You were right,
and i know that...

28:38.384 --> 28:41.085
This is all really just
a huge long shot,

28:41.087 --> 28:42.820
And i-i probably
won't even get it,

28:42.822 --> 28:44.988
And i could totally mess up
and forget all my words.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.056
I just...

28:46.058 --> 28:47.591
I'm sorry.

28:48.828 --> 28:51.962
Rachel, what is going on?

28:54.667 --> 28:57.067
I'm just scared.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.905
I haven't been this scared
in my whole life.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.276
You know, when i was
in high school,

29:06.278 --> 29:08.078
And i had all these
big broadway dreams,

29:08.080 --> 29:11.181
I just got used to
everyone laughing at me.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.852
And i figured one day
i would make it,

29:14.854 --> 29:18.255
And i would show them that
i'm not a joke anymore.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.224
(sniffles) and then i did,

29:20.226 --> 29:21.692
And it all fell apart,

29:21.694 --> 29:25.195
And i realized that there is a
whole different kind of laughing

29:25.197 --> 29:27.264
That is way worse, so...

29:28.901 --> 29:32.202
I can't. I can't fail again.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.771
(sniffles)

29:33.773 --> 29:37.040
Rachel, we're all going
to fail again and again.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.676
You think i haven't had
bad nights on tour?

29:41.147 --> 29:43.247
The hardest part

29:43.249 --> 29:45.249
Is just getting up,
shaking it off

29:45.251 --> 29:48.218
And getting on with it.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.920
But let me tell you this.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.622
When you sing,

29:51.624 --> 29:53.757
Nobody's laughing.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.293
Thank you.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.896
All right, now stand up.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.233
And take a deep breath.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.401
Whew.

30:04.403 --> 30:05.435
And there's only two things

30:05.437 --> 30:06.570
That you need to remember.

30:06.572 --> 30:07.604
What's your name?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.106
Rachel berry.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.507
And?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.576
My name is rachel berry,
and i'll be singing

30:12.578 --> 30:15.245
"promises, promises"
by burt bacharach.

30:15.247 --> 30:18.448
("promises, promises" begins)

30:18.450 --> 30:19.917
¶ promises, promises ¶

30:19.919 --> 30:21.652
¶ i'm all through
with promises ¶

30:21.654 --> 30:22.753
¶ promises now ¶

30:22.755 --> 30:25.355

30:34.600 --> 30:36.333
¶ i feel free ¶

30:36.335 --> 30:40.204
¶ now i can look at myself ¶

30:40.206 --> 30:43.674
¶ and be proud ¶

30:43.676 --> 30:47.678
¶ i'm laughing out loud ¶

30:47.680 --> 30:49.613
¶ oh, promises, promises ¶

30:49.615 --> 30:52.182
¶ this is where those promises,
promises end ¶

30:52.184 --> 30:54.818
¶ i don't pretend ¶

30:54.820 --> 30:57.554
¶ that what was wrong ¶

30:57.556 --> 31:00.624
¶ can be right ¶

31:00.626 --> 31:02.492
¶ every night ¶

31:02.494 --> 31:04.328
¶ i sleep now ¶

31:04.330 --> 31:06.063
¶ no more lies ¶

31:06.065 --> 31:10.167
¶ things that
i promised myself ¶

31:10.169 --> 31:13.136
¶ fell apart ¶

31:13.138 --> 31:17.975
¶ but i found my heart ¶

31:17.977 --> 31:19.877
¶ oh, promises,
their kind of promises ¶

31:19.879 --> 31:23.013
¶ can just destroy a life ¶

31:23.015 --> 31:25.249
¶ oh, promises,
those kind of promises ¶

31:25.251 --> 31:28.385
¶ take all the joy from life ¶

31:28.387 --> 31:30.053
¶ oh, promises, promises ¶

31:30.055 --> 31:32.990
¶ my kind of promises ¶

31:32.992 --> 31:35.926

¶ love... ¶

32:00.252 --> 32:02.319
(applause)

32:10.062 --> 32:11.862
What are we doing here?

32:11.864 --> 32:14.064
Uh, does your fiancée work here?

32:14.066 --> 32:16.233
No.
Am i going to get to meet him?

32:16.235 --> 32:17.734
No, this is a surprise, okay?

32:17.736 --> 32:19.469
Trust me, it's...
You're gonna love it.

32:25.311 --> 32:28.145
¶ what's it all about? ¶

32:28.147 --> 32:31.381
¶ alfie ¶

32:31.383 --> 32:35.485
¶ is it just for the moment ¶

32:35.487 --> 32:38.155
¶ we live? ¶

32:38.157 --> 32:41.725
¶ what's it all about ¶

32:41.727 --> 32:45.295
¶ when you sort it out, alfie? ¶

32:45.297 --> 32:49.499
¶ are we meant to take more ¶

32:49.501 --> 32:51.935
¶ than we give? ¶

32:51.937 --> 32:57.774
¶ or are we meant to be kind? ¶

32:57.776 --> 33:01.178
¶ and if ¶

33:01.180 --> 33:05.248
¶ only fools are kind ¶

33:05.250 --> 33:07.484
¶ alfie ¶

33:07.486 --> 33:10.988
¶ then i guess it is wise ¶

33:10.990 --> 33:14.157
¶ to be cruel ¶

33:14.159 --> 33:17.861
¶ and if life belongs ¶

33:17.863 --> 33:21.631
¶ only to the strong, alfie ¶

33:21.633 --> 33:23.934
¶ what will you lend ¶

33:23.936 --> 33:29.172
¶ on an old golden rule? ¶

33:29.174 --> 33:34.478
¶ as sure as i believe ¶

33:34.480 --> 33:37.781
¶ there's a heaven above ¶

33:37.783 --> 33:39.616
¶ alfie ¶

33:39.618 --> 33:42.652
¶<i> ah...</i> ¶

33:42.654 --> 33:48.058
¶ i know there's
something much more ¶

33:48.060 --> 33:53.730
¶ something even unbelievers ¶

34:09.681 --> 34:14.418
¶ alfie... ¶

34:16.255 --> 34:18.321
¶<i> ooh.</i> ¶

34:33.405 --> 34:34.538
Hi, abuela.

34:34.540 --> 34:35.872
Hi.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.574
You look really good.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.742
Did you lose some weight?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.911
Diverticulitis.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.847
So you two know each other?

34:43.849 --> 34:46.183
Um, yeah. Well, uh...

34:46.185 --> 34:47.951
Remember when i was talking
about my wedding?

34:47.953 --> 34:49.519
Uh...
Mm-hmm.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.954
So santana's my fiancée.

34:54.026 --> 34:56.893
So you come into my home,

34:56.895 --> 34:59.362
Treat me with kindness,
lure me here

34:59.364 --> 35:01.565
And trick me
into seeing my granddaughter

35:01.567 --> 35:02.566
And hear her sing?

35:02.568 --> 35:04.367
Yes, because...

35:04.369 --> 35:06.136
I love santana with everything,

35:06.138 --> 35:08.805
And i would do anything
for santana, okay?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.807
Even tricking a sick old woman.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.910
You taught me to be

35:13.912 --> 35:16.780
A strong latina woman.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.215
To be bigger than the world

35:18.217 --> 35:20.050
Was ever gonna give me
permission to be.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.118
And i have.

35:22.421 --> 35:25.755
You-you taught me
not just to exist,

35:25.757 --> 35:27.557
Because i'm worth
so much more than that.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.294
And without britt,
i just... Exist.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.164
She's the love of my life,

35:34.166 --> 35:36.566
And i'm going to marry her,

35:36.568 --> 35:40.270
And-and i want to share
that with you, because...

35:40.272 --> 35:42.873
Without your love,
i-i think i just exist, too.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.409
Please, please,
just come to the wedding.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.811
No.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.546
Right is right.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.582
I love you, santana.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.317
But i don't love your sin.

35:56.288 --> 35:59.256
Girls marry boys,
not other girls.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.657
So you're really not coming?

36:00.659 --> 36:01.758
No.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.793
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

36:03.795 --> 36:05.061
But you disappointed me first.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.165
Good.

36:08.167 --> 36:09.366
I'm glad
you're not coming.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.769
You know,
the<i> new york times</i> said, um,

36:12.771 --> 36:14.538
Half the increase
in support of gay marriage

36:14.540 --> 36:16.806
Is due to
generational turnover.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.743
That's what smart people call
"crazy uptight bitches dying."

36:20.779 --> 36:22.179
You guys lost, okay?

36:22.181 --> 36:24.214
And honestly,
the rest of us are just...

36:24.216 --> 36:26.116
Going about our business,
being normal

36:26.118 --> 36:27.851
And waiting for you
not to be around--

36:27.853 --> 36:29.953
And not because you can stop us
from getting married,

36:29.955 --> 36:32.956
But just because
you're kind of annoying.

36:32.958 --> 36:36.026
You let her talk
to me like this?

36:37.896 --> 36:38.962
Take a look.

36:39.898 --> 36:42.132
Because this...

36:42.134 --> 36:44.401
This is what real
love looks like.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.971
And i love you so much.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.739
But britt is my family now,

36:49.741 --> 36:51.675
And if having her in my family

36:51.677 --> 36:54.644
Means not having you, then...

36:54.646 --> 36:56.746
That's a trade
i'll take any day.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.598
It was like walking
into your old bedroom

37:14.600 --> 37:15.865
After being away.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.500
Like, the comfort
and the smell

37:17.502 --> 37:18.702
And the lights
hitting your face...

37:18.704 --> 37:19.736
It was incredible.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.571
And once i started
to sing, it was like

37:21.573 --> 37:24.541
Everything stopped,
time froze...

37:24.543 --> 37:27.177
My mind hasn't been that clear
in a really long time.

37:27.179 --> 37:30.247
And i think
i sounded pretty good.

37:30.249 --> 37:32.215
Yeah, well, broadway berry's
back at it.

37:32.217 --> 37:33.283
So what
happened then?

37:33.285 --> 37:35.051
Did they just give you
the part on the spot?

37:35.053 --> 37:36.953
Ow! What?
I'm excited.

37:36.955 --> 37:39.055
I don't know.
Mercedes:
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.358
All that matters is you did
what you set out to do

37:41.360 --> 37:43.026
And you got back
on that horse, girl.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.894
I-- honestly,
i cannot thank you enough,

37:44.896 --> 37:46.363
Mercedes.
I've never felt

37:46.365 --> 37:47.364
So at peace

37:47.366 --> 37:48.865
After an audition.
All i needed

37:48.867 --> 37:50.700
Was that one second
between stepping on the stage

37:50.702 --> 37:51.935
And hitting that first note.

37:52.571 --> 37:54.471
(phone buzzes)

37:54.473 --> 37:55.805
Oh. Damn.

37:55.807 --> 37:58.108
Okay, we have to head
to the auditorium.

37:58.110 --> 38:00.110
I'll meet you guys there.
Don't be late.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.079
You know you don't
need a mentor

38:03.081 --> 38:04.481
To get back to broadway
or new york.

38:04.483 --> 38:06.116
You're going to get
back there no matter what.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.819
Nothing can stop rachel berry.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.756
Thanks.
You're very sweet.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.424
And i'm also happy

38:14.426 --> 38:15.792
You're going to be sticking
around for a while,

38:15.794 --> 38:17.460
Because we have so much
fun working together,

38:17.462 --> 38:19.229
And... All the fun.

38:19.231 --> 38:21.264
Well, what do you say

38:21.266 --> 38:22.766
We enjoy every last
minute of it, then?

38:22.768 --> 38:26.002
Want to get that breadstix
dinner back on the books?

38:26.004 --> 38:27.570
Uh, yeah. Yeah,
that'd be great.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.239
Um, next thursday?

38:29.241 --> 38:30.807
Yeah.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.748
What are you
thinking about?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.483
Abuela.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.419
And how i should
be mad at her,

38:42.421 --> 38:44.321
But i just feel
sad for her.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.523
What are you
thinking about?

38:46.525 --> 38:49.259
Debra messing
and hypercubes,

38:49.261 --> 38:51.361
But also abuela.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.330
God, i shouldn't have said
all those nasty things to her.

38:53.332 --> 38:54.764
It was...
Wait.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.266
(sighs)
now, listen,
i'm really,

38:56.268 --> 38:58.335
Really proud
of how you stood up for me.

38:58.337 --> 39:00.103
You're my lady knight

39:00.105 --> 39:01.671
In shining armor.
(giggles)

39:01.673 --> 39:04.007
And i, um,
i just wanted to believe

39:04.009 --> 39:05.709
That people could really change.

39:05.711 --> 39:07.744
And i wanted her to say
that she accepts me.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.349
But i have a lot of love
in my life already.

39:12.351 --> 39:14.317
A lot. A lot, a lot.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.352
Me.

39:15.354 --> 39:16.986
(laughing):
Yeah. You.

39:16.988 --> 39:19.222
Now, let's go humor

39:19.224 --> 39:20.724
A bunch of
tone-deaf losers

39:20.726 --> 39:22.392
By acting surprised when we
walk in this auditorium.

39:22.394 --> 39:23.393
Deal.

39:23.395 --> 39:24.728
(fake gasp)
oh, my god.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.963
(school bell ringing)

39:26.965 --> 39:28.865
May i escort you
to your seats?

39:28.867 --> 39:29.966
Mmm, you may.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.203
Hello.

39:35.307 --> 39:36.973
Hi.
Roderick:
Good evening.

39:36.975 --> 39:38.475
So fancy.
I know.

39:38.477 --> 39:39.776
Hi.
Madison:
Hi.

39:41.179 --> 39:42.312
These are your
seats, ladies.

39:42.314 --> 39:43.680
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.748
(laughs)

39:48.387 --> 39:51.354
Welcome, guests of honor.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.256
Now, as your wedding planner,

39:53.258 --> 39:55.992
I need to warn you
about a major crisis

39:55.994 --> 39:57.827
Regarding the wedding reception.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.830
Since santana's grandmother
is no longer attending--

40:00.832 --> 40:01.865
Such a shame--

40:01.867 --> 40:03.767
There is now an empty seat

40:03.769 --> 40:05.168
At the lopez family table.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.437
And i don't know
what to do about it.

40:07.439 --> 40:10.273
The problem isn't
removing a chair;

40:10.275 --> 40:12.675
The problem is adding chairs,

40:12.677 --> 40:14.744
Because several other members

40:14.746 --> 40:17.447
Of santana's family
want that spot.

40:19.851 --> 40:22.018
Kurt:
Family are the people

40:22.020 --> 40:25.021
Who embrace you with open arms
no matter what.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.790
They can see the pain
in your eyes

40:26.792 --> 40:28.291
Even when you're fooling
everyone else.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.260
Family's about laughing louder,

40:30.262 --> 40:31.928
Smiling bigger
and living better.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.530
Family's like fudge.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.231
Mostly sweet,
with a couple of nuts.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.967
Mercedes: And although we're
not related by blood,

40:37.969 --> 40:40.603
We are bonded by
something much stronger: Love.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.071
And it might be
a little presumptuous,

40:42.073 --> 40:43.740
But we would like to be
in your wedding party.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.909
And the new kids and i
would be honored

40:45.911 --> 40:47.610
To cater, pass out programs

40:47.612 --> 40:49.245
And release the doves.
There had better be doves.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.114
Oh, there will be.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.483
Santana and brittany,
this is for you. We love you.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.953
