00:02.736 --> 00:04.305
"There was no reason
for what I did.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.340
"I loved the old man.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.409
"He had never
wronged me.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.246
"For his gold I had no desire.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.948
"I think it was his eye.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.718
"He had the eye
of a vulture.

00:19.320 --> 00:23.657
"Whenever it fell upon me,
my blood ran cold,

00:23.791 --> 00:27.795
"and so I made up my mind
to kill the old man,

00:27.928 --> 00:31.099
"and rid myself
from the eye forever.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.836
"Every night
I looked in upon him
while he slept.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.873
<i>"Until the old man's hour</i>
had come.

00:40.007 --> 00:42.910
<i>"With a loud yell,</i>
I leaped into the room.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.279
<i>"He shrieked once.</i>

00:45.413 --> 00:48.048
<i>"But in an instant,</i>
I dragged him to the floor

00:48.182 --> 00:49.850
<i>"and pulled the heavy bed</i>
over him.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.220
<i>"Stone dead.</i>

00:52.353 --> 00:54.722
<i>"I dismembered the corpse.</i>

00:54.855 --> 00:57.491
"I cut off the head,
the arms, and the legs.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.494
"But, before long,
my head ached.

01:01.962 --> 01:04.365
"I fancied a ringing
in my ear.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.300
"The noise increased,

01:06.434 --> 01:09.503
"a low, dull,
quick sound."

01:10.738 --> 01:12.606
"I gasped for breath,

01:12.740 --> 01:14.508
"but the noise
steadily increased."

01:17.345 --> 01:19.313
<i>"I paced the floor</i>
to and fro.

01:19.447 --> 01:23.684
"I foamed, I raved, I swore!

01:23.817 --> 01:25.919
"I swung the chair
above the bed over him.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.222
<i>"But the noise</i>
increased."

01:28.356 --> 01:30.258
"It grew louder."

01:30.391 --> 01:31.592
"Louder..."

01:31.725 --> 01:32.893
"Louder."

01:33.594 --> 01:35.095
"Here, here!

01:35.229 --> 01:39.066
"It is the beating
of his hideous heart."

01:45.373 --> 01:46.774
Did you see
his face?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.509
I swear, I thought
he was gonna have
a heart attack.

01:49.210 --> 01:49.943
How much time's left?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.646
Four minutes.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.915
I say we go in now
before he has
an actual heart attack.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.350
He knew the rules.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.319
Besides, you can't be
afraid of the dark

01:58.452 --> 01:59.620
and be in
the Poe Society.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.055
Jimmy, yo,
everything okay
down there?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.524
Help!

02:08.095 --> 02:09.096
Help me!

02:09.230 --> 02:10.431
What?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.565
Call 911!

02:23.911 --> 02:26.780
If one of these four guys
is Rakitin,
I can't prove it.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.449
You accessed
their hard drives,
data profile?

02:28.582 --> 02:30.918
I did.
CIA, DIA, State.

02:31.051 --> 02:34.655
If one of these analysts
is leaking intel,
I couldn't tell you how.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.691
Which tells me that
however cautious
Rakitin was being before,

02:37.825 --> 02:39.660
he's being that much
more cautious now.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.295
I want them followed.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.597
Tell Park to pull
whatever resources she needs
to get eyes on all four.

02:43.731 --> 02:44.832
I have to meet
Reddington.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.769
Captain Kidd.
The pirate.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.939
The only pirate
who actually
buried his treasure.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.174
Along the coast
of East Hampton.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.310
The irony abounds.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.279
We're talking about
a child's overdose.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.348
Yes.
On buried treasure.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.749
Fentanyl.

03:01.882 --> 03:04.084
That he thought
was nothing more
than dust.

03:04.218 --> 03:07.955
An innocent and tragic mistake
that confirms my decision

03:08.088 --> 03:10.391
as to the next name
on the Blacklist.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.759
Captain Kidd.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.594
Your drop site
is swarming
with cops.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.695
They could trace
the drugs
back to me.

03:14.828 --> 03:15.996
You promised me.
I promised you,

03:16.129 --> 03:18.399
like I promise all of
my customers,
a safe drop.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.468
Ted here
screwed that up.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.636
I want you to know
Ted won't screw up again.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.544
<i>Captain Kidd</i>
is a glorified middle man

03:30.678 --> 03:33.447
who facilitates
criminal transactions

03:33.581 --> 03:37.618
by guaranteeing payment,
pickup, and delivery

03:37.751 --> 03:39.553
between otherwise
warring factions.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.154
By using hidden treasure.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.491
GPS-tagged hiding spots.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.192
Like an abandoned house
where he can hide drugs

03:45.326 --> 03:46.460
where no one can
find them.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.928
Except for
a group of kids.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.565
He takes possession
of an item for sale,
hides it,

03:51.699 --> 03:54.067
and informs the buyer
of its location

03:54.201 --> 03:56.670
once payment has been made
in the same fashion.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.472
Like geocaching
for narcotics.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.174
Narcotics.
Or contraband.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.242
Or people.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.878
He hides people?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.881
Yes, which is why
this case is
of some urgency.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.017
Are you telling me that
someone's been abducted?

04:10.150 --> 04:12.920
Not yet, but I believe
she will be
if we don't act quickly.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.054
Who?

04:14.187 --> 04:15.956
Safiya Maroun.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.891
Was born in Riyadh.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.661
In 2006,
she was committed
to a mental institution

04:20.794 --> 04:23.531
for defying her male
guardian's wishes.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.866
Later that year,
she was granted
asylum in America

04:25.999 --> 04:28.402
and has since become one of
the most prominent opponents

04:28.536 --> 04:30.003
of Saudi Arabian repression

04:30.137 --> 04:32.039
and is the founder
of Brighter Path,

04:32.172 --> 04:33.874
an organization
that helps get women

04:34.007 --> 04:36.209
and people in
the LGBTQ+ community

04:36.344 --> 04:38.312
out of countries
with oppressive regimes.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.647
The woman's a hero.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.982
And a target.
Of Neville Townsend.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.617
According to Reddington,

04:43.751 --> 04:46.119
<i>Townsend's been contracted</i>
by the Saudi secret police

04:46.253 --> 04:48.121
<i>to abduct Maroun</i>
<i>from her home</i>
in Maryland.

04:48.255 --> 04:49.823
<i>I've notified</i>
Hyattsville PD.

04:49.957 --> 04:50.924
<i>I want you to</i>
meet them on-site.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.926
Has anyone spoken
to Maroun?

04:53.060 --> 04:55.329
I tried, but it's late.
Could be her phone's
turned off.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.637
Don't hurt me!

05:04.237 --> 05:06.239
No! No!

05:06.374 --> 05:07.775
Get off me!

05:07.908 --> 05:09.743
I just heard
from my people.
It's done.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.912
She'll be here
within the hour.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.515
But what if
we're too late?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.750
According to Reddington,
she'll be buried alive

05:16.884 --> 05:18.586
until Saudi Secret Service
pays Townsend.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.720
At which point,
this Captain Kidd

05:19.853 --> 05:21.254
will give them
the GPS coordinates

05:21.389 --> 05:23.657
so the Mabahith
can dig her up
and kill her.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.125
That's right.
So don't be late.

05:26.894 --> 05:27.895
Where's Park?

05:28.028 --> 05:29.597
Hunting down
Rakitin.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.899
Why, so he can
confirm Reddington's
a Russian plant?

05:32.032 --> 05:33.501
Mr. Reddington's
a traitor,

05:33.634 --> 05:36.269
Agent Keen's thrown in
with a man who abducts
human rights activists,

05:36.404 --> 05:40.107
and we're hunting
for a pirate that
buries people alive.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.975
Sometimes I think I never
should've left the circus.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.016
So much for
not being too late.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.788
Has the husband
made a statement?

05:54.922 --> 05:56.890
Not yet.
He's still
in surgery.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.291
What about neighbors
or a passerby?

05:58.426 --> 05:59.593
Anybody see anything?

05:59.727 --> 06:00.694
Afraid not.

06:01.829 --> 06:02.796
Maybe this
is his statement.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.504
Who's Nora?
Eleanor,
the oldest daughter.

06:10.638 --> 06:12.506
First we thought maybe
the girl got taken, too.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.942
But she and her sister
are both accounted for.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.977
His wife's been abducted,
he doesn't know by whom,

06:17.110 --> 06:18.612
and he uses what
little strength he has

06:18.746 --> 06:19.480
to write
his daughter's name.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.015
Why?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.651
Maybe because
it's not a name.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.755
Kidnappers disarmed
the system.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.823
I'm sure they did,
to avoid tripping the alarm.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.526
And to prevent
the abduction from
being videotaped.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.728
Yes. But what
I'm interested in

06:34.862 --> 06:36.830
is what happened
before the abduction.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.869
Hello.
Who might you be?

06:42.002 --> 06:45.673
I need an APB
on a late-model Escalade,
grey, no plates.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.909
I read up on you.
I'm a fan of your work.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.944
I'm begging you,
please.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
Nothing will happen
to you on my watch.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.582
Please don't do this!

06:54.715 --> 06:57.384
You will have
plenty of air,
nice warm clothes.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.020
Just breathe easily
and this part will be
over soon, all right?

07:00.153 --> 07:00.921
Don't do this!

07:02.289 --> 07:03.256
Stop!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.261
Don't do this!

07:11.732 --> 07:12.766
I mean it.
She's an inspiration.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.004
Which is exactly what
the royal family fears.

07:17.137 --> 07:19.372
Making her a martyr
will only make her
more inspirational.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.774
More people
will take her place.

07:20.908 --> 07:21.875
I hope so.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.877
The royal family
pays top dollar

07:24.011 --> 07:26.213
to make their competition
disappear.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.848
Don't do this!

07:35.422 --> 07:36.690
Hey, it's me.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.259
I have something
you may be interested in.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.062
Opera? Aliens?
Freeganism?

07:42.195 --> 07:45.098
I'm interested in
any number of topics,
most anything.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.399
Except accounting.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.935
This isn't about
accounting, is it?

07:48.068 --> 07:51.404
It's about the intercept
out of China.
The pending cyberattack.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.674
I am interested.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.609
Well, then we should talk.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.978
How about the fountains?
Meridian Hill?

07:58.111 --> 08:01.682
I'd prefer something
a little more intimate.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.084
Come to the restaurant.
You remember, 3rd and North.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.653
We're closed for renovations,

08:05.786 --> 08:08.321
so I can promise us
a quiet corner.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.094
Agent Mojtabai,
we've been
looking for you.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.797
Where've you been?
It's, uh, sort of
a long story.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.398
I hope it has
a happy ending,

08:18.532 --> 08:21.034
because we found
the grey Escalade
from Maroun's abduction.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.436
It was abandoned
and scrubbed.
And the husband?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.272
Ressler questioned him
at County
where he's recovering.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.574
He doesn't know anything.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.141
Well, um, I might.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.977
Uh, I reached out
to Cyber Crime

08:30.110 --> 08:33.080
to provide us with a list
of any online drug dealers

08:33.213 --> 08:36.183
who have informants
that we could question
about Captain Kidd

08:36.316 --> 08:38.719
or how he's distributing
product using
street-tech workarounds.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.287
I told you
I spoke to DEA.

08:40.420 --> 08:41.855
They don't have
anything on Kidd.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.490
Which is why
I spent all night

08:43.624 --> 08:47.027
buying mephedrone, cocaine,
and MDMA on the dark web.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.529
You bought
illegal drugs online.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.498
I did.
Which was terrifying.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.667
However, on the upside,
one of the dealers

08:53.801 --> 08:55.936
asked to meet
near a taco truck
in LeDroit Park

08:56.069 --> 08:58.471
that is totally
worth the drive.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.373
Sounds delicious.
Oh, you have
no idea, sir.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.976
They have a chicken mole
that is...

09:03.977 --> 09:04.978
Try and stay focused.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.080
Of the 16 dealers
I purchased from,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.882
eight are shipping
to me directly.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.518
Seven met to hand off
in person.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.820
And the last one?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.188
Just texted me, uh,
coordinates, photos,

09:15.322 --> 09:17.691
and directions of where
the drugs were dropped.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.126
They're using
Captain Kidd.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.729
It's a geo-tagged
hiding spot
in Penn Quarter.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.330
Take Ressler.
Pull the drugs,

09:23.463 --> 09:25.999
along with any surveillance
feeds of the area.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.567
Let's hope your online
shopping spree

09:27.701 --> 09:29.169
turns up more than
great chicken mole.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.557
Yes.
Gotta call it off.

10:24.692 --> 10:25.625
Why? What's going on?

10:25.759 --> 10:26.827
I got a tail.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.328
I'll call you back.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.478
Sure this is
the right location?

11:18.611 --> 11:19.947
Look at the photo.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.115
Instructions said
back corner
of the park,

11:22.249 --> 11:24.451
third light post
from the south.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.520
It's supposed to be
inside the broken
solar assembly.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.089
You think
someone else
found it?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.291
Well, maybe they knew
it was a setup
and got cold feet.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.327
There's no surveillance,
no obvious cameras.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.496
They chose this location
because it's a digital
dark spot.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.697
Oh, my God.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.832
What if somebody else
found those drugs?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.167
What if...

11:40.300 --> 11:41.634
What if a child
found those drugs?

11:41.769 --> 11:43.136
Hey, check it out.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.043
I don't get it.
You think Captain Kidd
took a cab here?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.179
No, I think that cab took
Captain Kidd's picture.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.351
The driver at South Cab
didn't witness anything,

11:58.485 --> 12:00.320
but his dash cam
caught the end
of the drop.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.357
White male, late 20s.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.859
Is the image
strong enough for
facial recognition?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.227
Resolution isn't the problem.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.762
We just don't have
a viable angle,

12:08.896 --> 12:10.798
and it's only
these 22 seconds.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.399
The cab only caught
the end.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.533
I mean, the kid
walks out of frame
and that's it.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.170
What's that?
The cup in his hand.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.911
"Kitt's Coffee."
Oh, they make
a mean mochaccino.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.479
They're also local.
They only have a few
locations in the city.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.348
Pull the sales records
and the surveillance feeds

12:28.481 --> 12:30.250
from any of their stores
in a mile radius.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.885
If the kid paid
with a credit card,

12:32.019 --> 12:33.520
then chances are we've got
his physical address.

12:33.653 --> 12:34.687
Get it and get him here.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.560
You can't prove that
my client is the person
in that footage.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.562
We know you work
for Captain Kidd.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.164
I don't.
I told you.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.799
Yeah, what's gonna happen
when we pull your prints

12:45.933 --> 12:48.101
off the drugs
we found in the park?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.937
Or the drugs we find
in your apartment?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.171
Mr. Moore isn't
responding to...

12:51.304 --> 12:52.973
Mr. Moore
is going to jail.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.808
Okay, look,
I'm telling
the truth.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.377
Okay? I...

12:57.510 --> 13:00.380
He's...
He's not my employer.
I don't work for Kidd.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.248
I've been
robbing him.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.917
Robbing him of what?

13:04.051 --> 13:05.385
Look, it's all kinds
of stuff.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.721
It's, uh, weapons,
stolen credit cards,
fake IDs.

13:08.856 --> 13:09.722
Narcotics?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.026
Yeah, narcotics.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.862
Allegedly narcotics.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.096
It's not just me.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.498
It's not like
I'm the only Seeker.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.767
What's a Seeker?
You do not have
to answer that.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.903
Explain to
your poorly prepared
mouthpiece here

13:23.036 --> 13:24.938
that I'm gonna have
officers and a warrant
at your residence

13:25.072 --> 13:27.474
before you even walk
out of this door.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.443
You need to cooperate
if you want to have any hope
of staying out of jail.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.478
Can you tell him that?

13:34.147 --> 13:35.248
Go ahead, Jarret.

13:39.286 --> 13:43.356
Captain Kidd uses droppers
to stash his product.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.825
How much product,
how many droppers,

13:45.959 --> 13:47.760
I don't know,
but it's a lot.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.764
We track what we can,
follow a dropper,
look for his stash.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.167
We know it was drugs
you stole from that stash
in the park,

13:54.301 --> 13:56.169
and I got a feeling

13:56.303 --> 13:57.971
that a drug test
will prove they're in
your system right now.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.739
Whoa, hold on.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.741
What if I were able
to forget about
that drug test?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.212
In exchange for...

14:05.345 --> 14:08.448
You hand over
whatever contraband
you have on hand.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.451
Whatever you stole
from these GPS-tagged
hiding spots.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.520
If that evidence helps me
find Captain Kidd,

14:13.653 --> 14:16.289
well, maybe I'll help you
stay out of jail.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.263
What the hell happened?

14:23.396 --> 14:24.597
I'll tell you
what happened.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.900
I was tailed
by the FBI.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.005
This guy Cooper,
he, uh...

14:32.139 --> 14:34.341
He's not standing down
like you said he would.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.310
You need to do something
about him.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.228
Hey. Came as quick
as I could.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.997
What's so urgent?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.332
Well, I ran a test
on the narcotics you pulled
from Moore's apartment.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.667
Yeah, that he stole
from the park.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.535
Yes, and we got
an interesting hit.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.404
Chemical analysis
showed it contained
powdered milk.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.539
The cutting agent?

15:06.673 --> 15:09.342
Notable because
it's a favorite of
the Guayabo cartel.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.378
MPD picked up
one of their dealers
last month,

15:11.511 --> 15:13.513
so I called to get a sample
from the evidence locker

15:13.646 --> 15:15.548
to confirm the samples
matched, but...
They didn't.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.317
Not only
don't they match,

15:17.450 --> 15:19.086
but the sample
we got from the city
wasn't drugs.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.054
It was 100% baking soda.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.956
So MPD seized
fake drugs?

15:23.090 --> 15:27.327
No. Their paperwork certifies
that the contents of
the seizure was heroin

15:27.460 --> 15:29.696
cut with powdered milk
at the time of testing.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.432
But between
testing and now,
someone took the drugs

15:32.565 --> 15:34.167
and left baking soda
behind.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.668
Between now and then?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.570
I mean, who had access
to the drugs in lockup?

15:37.704 --> 15:40.307
No one.
Evidence log shows
it was never touched.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.908
The case
against the cartel
is still being built,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.543
so it hasn't gone
to trial yet.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.045
The drugs were never
checked out of evidence

15:45.178 --> 15:47.380
or brought to a courtroom.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.683
So, heroin went into lockup
and baking soda came out.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.485
The last person
to touch those drugs,

15:52.619 --> 15:54.321
the only person
to handle them,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.923
would be the drug lab chemist
who tested them for the city.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.526
Who's that?
His name's
Tyler Schwartz.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.594
He's been with MPD
for just under
five years.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.896
Thank you.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.599
You don't understand
how close we came.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.768
If I hadn't made
the tail...
But you did.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.603
...she would have
exposed us both.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.772
But she didn't.

16:12.905 --> 16:16.176
I thought this was
about some intercept
out of China.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.245
The impending
cyberattack.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.779
Are you even
listening to me?

16:19.912 --> 16:24.017
Keenly, in the vain hope
of hearing about
this Chinese intercept.

16:24.151 --> 16:26.786
The Bureau
is following me,

16:26.919 --> 16:29.056
which means
they are following you.

16:29.189 --> 16:33.126
This whole thing
is about to blow up
and expose us both.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.997
Somehow I don't find
your fevered disposition
to be infectious, Andrew.

16:38.131 --> 16:40.033
My fevered dis...
What... What is
wrong with you?

16:40.167 --> 16:43.470
I am trying to...
to dig us
out of this mess.

16:43.603 --> 16:46.273
No, what you are doing
is a rather obvious

16:46.406 --> 16:50.410
and ineffectual dance
to cover your tracks.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.513
You killed
an innocent man, Andrew.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.783
You faked your death
to divert Harold Cooper,

16:56.916 --> 17:00.453
and as a result,
you've only made
matters worse.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.589
Now, I told you
I'd handle Cooper...

17:02.722 --> 17:04.657
Are you kidding me?
...which I will do.

17:04.791 --> 17:08.461
But Harold Cooper
is no fool, and your

17:10.130 --> 17:14.467
theatrics only confirm his belief
that he's being played.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.902
So stand back.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.037
I'll handle this.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.539
Okay, just back up
a second.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.210
How about, uh...
How about "thank you"
for picking up his tail?

17:23.343 --> 17:27.046
How about "thank you"
for not leading the FBI
directly to you,

17:27.180 --> 17:28.848
and thus to Moscow?
How about...

17:28.981 --> 17:30.650
How about
I break your jaw,

17:30.783 --> 17:32.051
wire it shut,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.487
and force-feed
blended cheeseburgers

17:34.621 --> 17:37.056
into your belly
until you burst?

17:39.692 --> 17:40.493
How about?

17:42.962 --> 17:44.364
No?

17:44.497 --> 17:46.199
Then shut the hell up
and listen.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.036
I told you
I would handle
Harold Cooper,

17:50.170 --> 17:51.638
and I will do just that.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.140
What you need to do

17:53.273 --> 17:54.407
is keep your mouth shut,

17:54.541 --> 17:55.575
your head down,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.076
and assure Moscow

17:57.210 --> 17:59.078
that the situation
is under control.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.913
Now, please, go away

18:01.047 --> 18:02.115
before this becomes

18:02.249 --> 18:03.516
decidedly more uncivil.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.557
Well, the evidence
was logged by MPD

18:10.690 --> 18:12.225
and sent to the lab
where you work.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.293
I mean,
you're the chemist
on record.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.128
I understand that.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.264
So help me understand
how drug evidence

18:17.397 --> 18:18.298
that the police
took off the street,

18:18.431 --> 18:20.533
drugs that you tested
in your lab,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.402
somehow got swapped
with baking soda.

18:23.636 --> 18:24.904
I should wait
for my lawyer.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.539
Tyler, your lawyer
can't stop us

18:26.673 --> 18:28.875
from re-testing every sample
you've examined and verified.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.211
And when we do,
we're gonna find out
they're all fake.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.314
Now, if you help us...

18:36.216 --> 18:37.284
I don't know what to say.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.051
What happened to those drugs?

18:45.592 --> 18:46.559
It's not just me!

18:49.462 --> 18:50.563
It's Williams.

18:51.931 --> 18:52.932
Goebel.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.571
What happens
to the drugs, Tyler?

19:00.740 --> 19:03.310
Our facility handles
hundreds of samples
every week,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.945
all kinds of drugs
from all over the city.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.914
Evidence you personally handle.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.417
Once we run
our chemical analysis
to legally confirm

19:10.550 --> 19:12.018
they're what
the police say they are,

19:12.151 --> 19:15.588
the cases go to trial
supported by
the lab certification.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.090
But the drug evidence,
it goes back into the vault.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.860
Nobody's supposed
to test it again.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.929
You're stealing
and re-selling
drug evidence.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.597
Like I said,
I'm not the only one.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.599
There's an entire network.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.501
With a distribution system.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.803
I already said too much.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.372
We know you're using
Captain Kidd.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.773
That's who
we're after here,

19:33.906 --> 19:35.275
and you're gonna
help us find him.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.177
I can't do that.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.979
You can if you wanna
help yourself.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.649
Tyler, look at me.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.618
How do we find
Captain Kidd?

19:58.465 --> 19:59.932
I've got both online.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.468
Go ahead.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.969
Do I have the buyer
on the line?

20:03.102 --> 20:04.704
Yes, we are here.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.839
<i>Do I have the seller</i>
<i>on the line?</i>
Yes.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.041
Seller, can you confirm
that the transaction is

20:09.175 --> 20:11.344
at least 100 blocks deep
on the Blockchain,

20:11.478 --> 20:13.846
as per our instructions?
I can.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.716
Seller, do I have
your consent to release
the package to the buyer?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.217
<i>You do.</i>

20:18.351 --> 20:20.152
Buyer, I'm sending you
an encrypted file

20:20.287 --> 20:22.355
<i>with your GPS-tagged</i>
identifier now.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.757
<i>This will include photos</i>
and verbal instructions

20:24.891 --> 20:27.159
<i>you can use to</i>
identify the drop site.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.662
<i>Gentlemen, while we wait,</i>
<i>I want to thank you</i>
for your patronage.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.137
We have it.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.739
<i>Is that your official</i>
confirmation?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.140
It is.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.311
In that case,
transaction 49r83
is complete.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.880
Gentlemen, again,
thank you for your business
and good day.

20:48.014 --> 20:51.284
Tell Penny we're funded.
Have her notify Nicosia.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.421
And, uh, send someone
out for lumpia
and a Mello Yello.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.022
I swear,
I could eat
a horse.

20:56.155 --> 20:57.857
What was that?

20:59.191 --> 21:00.192
What?
I don't hear any...

21:00.327 --> 21:02.662
Shh, there.
Sounds like...

21:02.795 --> 21:04.230
FBI! Hands in the air!
On the ground!

21:04.364 --> 21:05.698
On the ground, now!

21:08.034 --> 21:09.201
You can 86 the lumpia.

21:16.142 --> 21:17.510
Print back yet
on Kidd?

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
Oh, uh,
I just got them.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.714
That is, uh...
That's the good news.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.050
I'm listening.
I heard from
Agent Park.

21:24.183 --> 21:27.053
She was following one of
the Rakitin suspects,

21:27.186 --> 21:29.722
Andrew Patterson,
the analyst from the Office
of Intelligence and Analysis.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.024
Walk with me.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.527
Agent Park thinks
that Patterson made her.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.895
And the other suspects?

21:36.028 --> 21:38.097
Surveillance turned up
nothing on the other three.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.632
Day in the life.
Then we pick it up
again tomorrow.

21:39.766 --> 21:40.833
Yeah,
here's the thing,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.302
Agent Park doesn't think
that will be necessary.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.871
Oh? And why is that?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.873
She thinks Patterson
is the one
we're looking for.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.107
Mr. Reddington's source.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.876
Because he gave her
the slip?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.310
That proves he's smart,
not treasonous.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.579
It's not that
he gave her the slip.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.314
The bad news is where
he gave her the slip.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.449
And where was that?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.117
Corner of
3rd and North.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.586
Near Mr. Reddington's
restaurant.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.660
Well,
how we know about you
isn't important.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.462
What matters
is that we do.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.297
We know about
your geocaching,

22:11.431 --> 22:13.032
how you hide drugs
and people.

22:13.800 --> 22:14.934
Safiya Maroun.

22:15.968 --> 22:16.769
Tell me about her.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.106
Never heard of her.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.975
Looky here, your prints
came back a match to
a William Benedict.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.546
Tied to a low-rent
smuggling operation
back in 2014.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.014
Well, you've come
a long way
since then, huh?

22:29.649 --> 22:30.783
If you say so.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.786
Safiya Maroun. Where is she?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.690
I haven't the foggiest.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.692
There's a kid
in the ICU at County.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.293
He's 13 years old.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.162
He overdosed
on the fentanyl
that you stashed

22:43.295 --> 22:45.164
in that house
in the Southeast.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.099
Now, best-case scenario
for you,

22:47.233 --> 22:50.703
I think that's attempted
voluntary manslaughter.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.339
Like I said, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.708
Well, your MPD
partners in crime
have turned on you.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.243
They've given us
sworn affidavits.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.511
Yet here you are.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.680
And we both know why.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.651
Where's Maroun?
Where's my deal?

23:04.784 --> 23:06.318
You want to get,
what're you gonna give?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.054
Absolutely nothing.

23:08.187 --> 23:10.590
A woman's life
hangs in the balance,
a good woman.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.826
A heroic woman we are
moving heaven and earth
to try and save.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.063
But what we will not do,
what I refuse to do,

23:17.196 --> 23:19.331
is to cut a deal
with the likes of you
to make that happen.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.969
Then her blood
is on your hands,
not mine.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.438
Maybe, but I can
live with that,

23:25.572 --> 23:27.440
knowing that you'll be
spending the next 30 years

23:27.574 --> 23:29.609
taking showers with
murderers and rapists.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.854
Okay, so what?
We're sweating him
now, right?

23:43.590 --> 23:44.591
No, we're not
sweating him.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.292
We're building a case
against him.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.828
Then it's gonna be
prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.362
Yeah, but he's not
gonna tell us
how to find Maroun,

23:50.497 --> 23:51.430
not without a deal.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.732
No, he's not.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.769
But getting played
by another criminal,

23:56.903 --> 23:58.237
being forced to look
the other way

23:58.370 --> 24:00.106
to countenance
their sickness...

24:01.073 --> 24:02.374
Isn't that part of the job?

24:02.509 --> 24:03.943
Yeah, part I hate
he most.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.614
Do what you can
to get that scumbag
to talk,

24:07.747 --> 24:08.515
but he's not
getting a deal.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.086
I hear congratulations
are in order.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.454
You have Captain Kidd.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.723
Is that why
you're here?

24:16.856 --> 24:18.491
Time is of
the essence, Harold.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.529
If Safiya Maroun is
ever to draw a breath
of fresh air again,

24:22.662 --> 24:25.197
I suggest you let me
have a chat
with the Captain.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.099
Introduce him
to Brimley's badger.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.301
Your concern is noted,

24:29.435 --> 24:32.104
but we both know
you didn't come here just
to offer your services.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.042
I came hoping people
would speak the truth,

24:36.175 --> 24:38.477
Captain Kidd, us.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.582
Given your hypertension,
perhaps we should go first.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.793
We know about
Andrew Patterson.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.429
Do tell.

24:57.564 --> 24:58.998
We know he's Rakitin,

24:59.131 --> 25:01.934
your source in
the intelligence community.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.771
We suspected as much,
so Park tailed him,

25:04.904 --> 25:07.139
to the corner
of 3rd and North.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.841
It's a lovely
neighborhood.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.276
Fine place to go
for a walk.

25:10.409 --> 25:12.078
Or for dinner.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.714
3rd and North
is half a block
from your restaurant.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.116
Don't do this, Harold.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.952
He was going to meet you
to divulge classified intel.

25:21.821 --> 25:24.090
I'm asking you
as a friend,
not an adversary.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.257
A friend?

25:25.391 --> 25:26.959
I don't have friends
who betray this country.

25:31.798 --> 25:33.566
I understand
your quandary.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.036
You care a great deal
about Elizabeth.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.772
You want to
believe in her,

25:39.906 --> 25:43.175
to understand
and find reason

25:43.309 --> 25:45.812
in her quest
to destroy me.

25:47.513 --> 25:50.549
But for what I hope
is the final time,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.218
let me be clear,

25:53.620 --> 25:56.723
I am not a traitor
to this country,

25:56.856 --> 25:59.992
and I do not divulge
sensitive intelligence

26:00.126 --> 26:01.928
to this country's enemies.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.696
I know that's not true.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.431
No, Harold.
You think you know.

26:06.966 --> 26:11.237
You have pieces of a puzzle
that you think you can solve.

26:12.038 --> 26:13.873
But as I am the puzzle,

26:14.674 --> 26:15.908
I know that you can't.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.778
And as your friend

26:20.079 --> 26:21.213
and your colleague,

26:22.214 --> 26:23.282
I implore you,

26:24.316 --> 26:25.317
for your own sake,

26:26.518 --> 26:28.054
to please let this go.

26:29.321 --> 26:30.556
Is that
some sort of threat?

26:30.690 --> 26:35.294
Sincere advice. I have
unsavory associates.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.731
When cornered, they tend
to do unsavory things.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.332
Let me get this straight.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.168
You're not a Russian spy,

26:42.301 --> 26:45.371
and the person Park tailed
isn't supplying you intel.

26:45.504 --> 26:47.539
I'm on this
wild goose chase,

26:47.674 --> 26:49.108
and yet
my life is in danger?

26:50.042 --> 26:52.144
You need to trust me
on this.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.913
You mean
I need to believe you
over Elizabeth?

26:55.581 --> 26:57.616
That sounds as if
you're in contact
with her.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.118
I wish.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.188
She's an apparition.

27:02.321 --> 27:05.825
A ghost who leaves clues
in the night
but is gone by morning.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.059
You've taught her well.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.429
Harold, this,

27:12.164 --> 27:13.065
all of it,

27:13.966 --> 27:15.935
is between
her and me.

27:17.103 --> 27:20.006
She and I may not
agree on much,

27:20.139 --> 27:22.341
but I'm sure
we agree on this.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.778
Neither of us
would be able to
forgive ourselves

27:25.912 --> 27:30.382
if our problems
caused you to become
collateral damage.

27:34.620 --> 27:35.955
I'm glad
we've had this talk,

27:36.756 --> 27:39.258
and I appreciate your offer,

27:39.391 --> 27:41.627
but I'm confident we can get
what we need from Captain Kidd

27:41.761 --> 27:43.763
without the assistance
of Brimley's badger.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.839
Make the deal.
I'll get the AG
on board.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.006
The deal?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.507
The one you said
we weren't gonna make?

27:55.641 --> 27:56.542
Full immunity.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.578
So, what happened
with Reddington?

27:59.712 --> 28:01.113
You mean N-13?

28:01.247 --> 28:02.949
So you confronted him
about Rakitin,

28:03.082 --> 28:04.150
about how
he ditched Park?

28:04.283 --> 28:06.218
I don't condone
what Elizabeth's doing,

28:06.352 --> 28:08.020
but if we have to
pick sides in this war,

28:08.154 --> 28:10.122
I think it's past time
we picked hers.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.891
We need to get to Keen
before Reddington does,

28:12.024 --> 28:13.492
and because he works
with Townsend,

28:13.625 --> 28:15.327
Captain Kidd
can help us do that.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.263
I meant what I said
about getting played
by another criminal,

28:17.396 --> 28:19.131
but you were right.
It's what we do.

28:20.332 --> 28:21.133
So do it.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.906
Let me help you
with the fine print.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.207
You help, you walk.

28:29.175 --> 28:30.342
Full immunity.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.111
For past crimes.

28:32.244 --> 28:33.946
You jay-walk tomorrow,
I'm coming for you.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.149
I'll help you
with Maroun.

28:37.784 --> 28:39.151
No. And Townsend.

28:39.285 --> 28:41.720
No. No way.
I'm not crossing him.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.023
Well, that's just the cost
of doing business.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.026
If I snitch on him,
he'll find out.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.128
So what? Come on.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.030
You'll be
drinking mai tais
in witness protection.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.600
You can't protect me.
Not from him.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.603
That's a chance
you're just gonna
have to take.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.515
So, how does it work?
Walk me through
the steps.

29:09.648 --> 29:11.750
I want you to
bore me with every
tiny little detail.

29:13.820 --> 29:15.187
Our network,
we're just...

29:16.889 --> 29:18.257
It's a delivery system,

29:18.390 --> 29:21.193
a series of dead drops
in abandoned buildings

29:21.327 --> 29:23.062
or crowded
public locations.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.464
We provide
a layer of protection

29:25.597 --> 29:28.700
for the buyers and sellers
of illicit goods.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.570
In this case, the parcel was
acquired by Neville Townsend,

29:31.703 --> 29:33.105
taken to a holding site,

29:33.239 --> 29:34.907
then packaged
and prepared for delivery

29:35.041 --> 29:36.375
by one of our
splinter teams.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.776
Packaged and prepared?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.645
Bro,
this isn't a stolen gun
we're talking about.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.247
It's a person,

29:41.380 --> 29:43.582
which requires
an entirely different
set of precautions.

29:43.715 --> 29:44.984
So it's true.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.453
You really did bury
Safiya Maroun alive.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.355
<i>I delivered the product</i>
I was paid to transport.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.823
<i>That's what we do.</i>

29:50.957 --> 29:52.558
<i>So, the site's</i>
geo-tagged, right?

29:52.691 --> 29:54.994
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you send the buyers</i>
details, photos, maps.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.129
<i>We do, yeah,</i>
<i>but the buyer wanted</i>
to take delivery

29:57.263 --> 29:58.730
<i>somewhere that was</i>
especially remote.

29:59.531 --> 30:00.799
I can give you coordinates,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
but you're never gonna
get there in time.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.637
The GPS-tagged site
indicates that Maroun
is buried here,

30:05.771 --> 30:08.374
about a mile from
the west shoreline
on Taylors Island,

30:08.507 --> 30:10.342
and that puts her
midway between
the Slaughter Creek Broads

30:10.476 --> 30:11.844
and Robinson Neck Road.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.080
The buyer,
how big of a head start
does he have on us?

30:14.213 --> 30:16.248
We notified him
a little over
two hours ago.

30:16.382 --> 30:17.216
I can only assume
he's on his way there now.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.953
<i>** Through these</i>
<i>city nightmares</i>
you'd walk with me

30:22.721 --> 30:25.824
<i>** And we'd talk of it</i>
with idealistic assurance

30:25.958 --> 30:29.095
<i>** That it wouldn't</i>
tear us apart

30:29.228 --> 30:31.530
<i>** We'd keep our heads</i>
above the blackened water...

30:34.533 --> 30:35.434
<i>And if he gets</i>
to her...

30:35.567 --> 30:36.668
What do you mean
"if he gets to her"?

30:36.802 --> 30:38.304
You better hope
he gets to her.

30:38.437 --> 30:41.040
If he doesn't,
things go from bad
to worse in a hurry.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.341
What's that
supposed to mean?

30:42.474 --> 30:44.376
I told you.
She's on oxygen.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.345
Which is... limited.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.280
How much oxygen?

30:49.481 --> 30:52.251
She's got roughly
six hours of air.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.653
Got less than an hour.
<i>** Through a grimy window</i>
that I can't keep clean

30:54.786 --> 30:57.556
<i>** Through billowing smoke</i>
that's swallowed the sun

30:58.690 --> 30:59.959
<i>** You're nowhere to be seen</i>

31:00.092 --> 31:01.994
<i>** You're nowhere</i>
to be seen, seen...

31:14.340 --> 31:16.308
<i>** Do you think our desires</i>
still burn?

31:17.843 --> 31:20.312
<i>** I guess it was desires</i>
that tore us apart

31:21.347 --> 31:22.714
<i>** There has to be passion</i>

31:22.848 --> 31:25.217
<i>** There has to be</i>
passion, passion

31:25.351 --> 31:28.554
<i>** A passion for living,</i>
surviving

31:28.687 --> 31:30.256
I don't understand.
Where are you taking me?

31:30.389 --> 31:31.857
<i>** And that means detachment **</i>

31:31.991 --> 31:33.325
Why didn't you just
leave me to die?

31:34.360 --> 31:36.495
Say something!

31:36.628 --> 31:37.829
<i>** To beat you with</i>
when you are down...

31:50.876 --> 31:52.744
Look, I want you to know
I am not afraid.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.049
Keep walking.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.955
You should have
Saint John Creek
to your west.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.124
In about a half mile,
you're gonna make
a left.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.525
There's no road
on the GPS.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.094
<i>That's because</i>
it's not on the GPS.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.861
I'm looking
at satellite feeds.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.530
Looks like it may be
some kind of a trail

32:11.663 --> 32:13.532
or maybe
an old fire road.

32:13.665 --> 32:15.367
We're not gonna
get there in time.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.403
<i>** We'd blacken</i>
each other's skies...

32:42.094 --> 32:43.195
Go to the ground.

32:46.532 --> 32:47.966
GPS signal's
emanating from here,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.269
quarter mile south,
just before the creek.

32:50.402 --> 32:51.970
All right,
we go in on foot.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.939
One team from the east,
one from the west.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.075
Our unsub's
in here.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.411
He's gonna have backup
and he's gonna wanna fight,
all right? Let's go.

32:59.545 --> 33:03.182
<i>** Unjustified crimes</i>
carried on stifled calls

33:03.315 --> 33:04.683
<i>** Would you walk with me now</i>
through this pouring rain? **

33:04.816 --> 33:06.418
He wants to watch.
That's what this is for.

33:07.419 --> 33:08.420
Well...

33:09.455 --> 33:11.457
I want you to know this.

33:11.590 --> 33:15.461
You can kill me,
you can try to make
an example of me,

33:15.594 --> 33:19.031
but it will only invigorate
the people I fight for.

33:19.165 --> 33:22.801
You will make them stronger,
and they will fight back.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.050
The shot came
from our west.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.457
Get off! Aah!

34:00.272 --> 34:01.307
Don't move!

34:10.949 --> 34:13.185
Is it just me or is he
way too comfortable?

34:13.319 --> 34:15.387
Main Justice
is sending an AUSA.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.989
He won't be comfortable
once he's told what
he's being charged with.

34:18.124 --> 34:19.491
Maroun verified
Kidd's intel.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.161
How's she doing?
Good.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.096
Great, considering.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.232
EMTs gave her
a clean bill of health.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.499
Did you get
her statement?

34:27.633 --> 34:29.501
Yeah, and based on
what she told me,

34:29.635 --> 34:31.870
that guy has no business
looking so relaxed.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.372
No, it's weird, right?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.641
It's kind of like you
being in the circus.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.409
You were in the circus?

34:37.543 --> 34:41.513
I, uh, ran away from home
when I saw the Great Davido
spin 75 plates at once.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.015
I was hired as a roadie
on a Monday.

34:44.150 --> 34:46.718
Lost my virginity
to a trapeze artist
on a Tuesday.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.687
She left me
for the strongman
on a Wednesday,

34:48.820 --> 34:50.589
and I was back home
eating matzo ball soup

34:50.722 --> 34:52.524
watching <i>Jerry Maguire</i>
on a Thursday.

34:52.658 --> 34:55.927
It was, um...
It was quite the whirlwind.

34:56.061 --> 34:59.231
It's weird, right?
It's like
he's in on a joke.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.133
Forget about him.
Go talk to Kidd.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.068
The marshals have him
in protective custody.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.571
Telling us about Maroun
was only part of the deal.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.373
Now he's gotta tell you
what he knows about Townsend.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.007
Well, Kidd's scared
to death of this guy.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.277
He doesn't think
we can protect him
against Townsend.

35:11.410 --> 35:13.912
Well, of course we can,
but we only will
if he tells us what he knows.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.320
I'm not saying
you're bad at your jobs.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.121
Our job
is to protect you,

35:23.255 --> 35:25.157
and you're saying
we can't do that.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.259
Not three of you.
Not against him.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.062
Relax, it's the FBI.

35:31.197 --> 35:32.731
Agent Ressler.

35:32.864 --> 35:34.966
He's coming here
to ask you about
the bogeyman.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.903
Go ahead and make fun,
but you're gonna
need more men.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.971
Townsend can't hurt you
if he can't find you.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.107
Since we're the only ones
that know you're here,

35:42.241 --> 35:43.642
that's not gonna happen.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.189
You did well.

36:09.435 --> 36:10.436
Look at me.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.607
I haven't said anything
about you.

36:17.443 --> 36:18.444
I know.

36:21.613 --> 36:22.648
And now you never will.

36:37.329 --> 36:40.165
Assistant Director Cooper?
Ken Spears.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.001
From Main Justice.
Yes, I've been
expecting you.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.637
I've had a copy made of
Safiya Maroun's statement,

36:45.771 --> 36:48.340
but, of course,
you'll want to
speak with her yourself.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.442
Actually,
that won't be necessary.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.543
Oh?

36:52.478 --> 36:53.479
And why is that?

37:20.105 --> 37:21.673
Aram, we got a problem.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.077
Sir.

37:26.211 --> 37:28.547
Sir, Agent Ressler called.
Townsend got to Captain Kidd.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.282
He doesn't know how,
but he did.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.387
Sir, do you
hear me?

37:35.521 --> 37:37.088
Two marshals are dead
and Kidd is gone.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.392
The Saudi operative
has been released.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.660
What?

37:41.793 --> 37:44.229
No charges
are being filed.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.832
There's a plane
standing by at Dulles
to fly him to Riyadh.

37:46.965 --> 37:49.901
Wait, wait, wait.
He... He had someone
buried alive.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.103
He was about to
execute her,

37:52.237 --> 37:55.941
Of the 19 terrorists on 9/11,
15 came from Saudi Arabia.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.976
After the attack,
King Fahd urged
the White House

37:58.109 --> 38:00.712
to evacuate the members
of Osama bin Laden's family

38:00.846 --> 38:02.714
who were living
in the United States.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.984
Eventually, the FBI
assisted in returning
two dozen of them.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.219
No questions asked.

38:10.255 --> 38:13.058
King Fahd is gone,
but his oil isn't,

38:13.191 --> 38:15.727
and the royal family has
as much influence as ever.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.932
Safiya Maroun is a threat
to the royal family, so...

38:21.066 --> 38:23.535
Main Justice isn't interested
in her or her statement.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.537
The only thing
they're interested in

38:25.671 --> 38:27.072
is pretending
it never happened.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.274
<i>** Weighing down on me</i>

38:29.408 --> 38:30.308
I have to tell Safiya.

38:30.442 --> 38:33.244
<i>** Weighing down</i>

38:35.046 --> 38:38.083
<i>** All of these chains</i>

38:38.216 --> 38:41.853
<i>** Weighing down on me...</i>

38:41.987 --> 38:44.423
Your fight
with Harold is helping
Elizabeth's cause.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.592
And that cause

38:47.593 --> 38:48.927
will only end up
hurting her.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.931
I'm not fighting
with Harold.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.066
His fight with you, then.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.068
Which you could stop,
but choose not to.

38:58.804 --> 39:00.439
Go on, then,
give me my medicine.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.043
You gave him the case

39:05.176 --> 39:07.278
so you could
get to Captain Kidd

39:07.413 --> 39:09.280
and learn
about Townsend.

39:09.415 --> 39:11.783
He got to Kidd,
but kept him away
from you

39:11.917 --> 39:13.485
so he could get to
Townsend first.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.688
In the end,
Townsend got to Kidd

39:16.822 --> 39:18.156
and neither of you
learned anything.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.827
And I thought taking the pills
was unpleasant.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.663
<i>** Weighing down on me...</i>

39:24.796 --> 39:25.797
Elizabeth is lost.

39:27.433 --> 39:31.336
She's aligned herself
with a powerful enemy.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.305
You and Harold
cannot go on fighting
each other and him.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.975
Find a way
to call a truce,

39:37.108 --> 39:39.310
not just for Elizabeth,
but for Harold, too.

39:40.646 --> 39:42.714
His list of enemies
has grown too long.

39:44.550 --> 39:45.817
Our friend in the East.

39:47.753 --> 39:51.289
I fear his patience
may run thin.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.838
<i>** Yeah, I drift away</i>

40:07.839 --> 40:10.341
<i>** To a brighter place</i>

40:10.476 --> 40:12.343
<i>** That I close my eyes</i>
to see...

40:16.682 --> 40:18.183
<i>** And there's some days...</i>

40:18.316 --> 40:20.218
Reddington,
what am I not seeing?

40:21.987 --> 40:23.021
<i>** But I'm losing my belief...</i>

40:23.154 --> 40:24.856
We have a system in place.

40:26.324 --> 40:29.227
You are a vital part
of that system.

40:29.360 --> 40:34.132
The FBI following you
threatens that system.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.635
<i>** Weighing down...</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:41.573
Yet he seems unwilling
to do anything
to stop them.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.942
No, no, no. Not unwilling.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.879
<i>** Weighing down</i>

40:49.347 --> 40:50.549
Unable, then.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.184
<i>** I'm down on my knees</i>

40:53.318 --> 40:55.754
<i>** I need some relief</i>

40:55.887 --> 41:01.259
<i>** Some quiet and peace</i>

41:01.392 --> 41:03.595
<i>** I've been here before</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:06.798
<i>** Tethered and torn</i>

41:06.932 --> 41:11.670
<i>** I won't take anymore...</i>

41:11.803 --> 41:13.404
The instructions
are clear.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.609
Who to speak with,
what to say.

41:18.644 --> 41:21.913
They must be executed
to the letter.

41:24.583 --> 41:27.619
<i>** All of these chains...</i>

41:27.753 --> 41:30.288
<i>** Weighing down on me</i>

41:30.421 --> 41:33.992
<i>** Weighing down...</i>

41:35.794 --> 41:36.928
Harold Cooper?

41:39.130 --> 41:41.266
All of this is happening
at his instruction.

41:41.399 --> 41:43.835
Yes, but he is

41:43.969 --> 41:46.872
an assistant director
of the FBI.

41:47.005 --> 41:50.008
<i>** All of these chains</i>

41:50.141 --> 41:53.344
<i>** Weighing down on me... **</i>

41:53.478 --> 41:55.947
I have known Raymond
longer than anyone.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.017
I know and trust him
like a brother.

42:00.586 --> 42:02.921
But if he won't do
what's necessary

42:03.054 --> 42:05.824
to protect what we've built
over the decades,

42:05.957 --> 42:06.958
I will.

42:11.029 --> 42:15.567
Even if it means eliminating
an assistant director
of the FBI.
