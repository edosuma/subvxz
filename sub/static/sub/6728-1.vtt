01:04.000 --> 01:08.600
This is the most famous
true African adventure.

01:08.800 --> 01:14.200
Famous because what took place
at Tsavo never happened before.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.100
Colonel John Patterson
was there when it began.

01:18.200 --> 01:23.200
A fine Irish gentleman,
a brilliant engineer.

01:23.400 --> 01:29.400
He was my friend.
My name is Samuel. I was there.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.500
Remember this...

01:32.700 --> 01:38.300
Even the most impossible parts of
this story really happened.

01:46.400 --> 01:49.000
John Henry Patterson.
I'm Robert Beaumont.

01:50.300 --> 01:54.100
Firm handshake. Tells me
a lot about you. Do sit down.

01:58.700 --> 02:01.500
Now, why don't you tell me about me?

02:01.700 --> 02:07.000
To get you started, many people find
me handsome, with a wonderfuI smile.

02:07.200 --> 02:10.300
Winning personality, heaps of charm.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.300
My wife is
the game player in the family, sir.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.700
Thank you, gentlemen.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.700
Look at me closely, ColoneI Patterson.
I'm a monster.

02:25.300 --> 02:30.000
My only pleasure is tormenting
those people who work for me.

02:30.200 --> 02:34.000
People like yourself.
Make one mistake and I promise...

02:34.200 --> 02:35.900
I'll make you hate me.

02:37.500 --> 02:42.900
We're in a race, and the prize is
nothing less than the continent of Africa.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.200
We're building the most expensive
and daring railroad in history

02:46.400 --> 02:51.500
for the purpose of saving Africa
from the Africans, and to end slavery.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.100
Our competitors are
the Germans and the French.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.900
We will stay ahead provided
you do what I've hired you to do;

03:00.100 --> 03:06.200
build a bridge across the river Tsavo
and be finished in five months.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.900
- Can you do that?
- I'm sure you've examined my record.

03:10.100 --> 03:15.900
- You know I've never been late.
- I'm aware of your distinguished record.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.000
Let me remind you,
you've never built in Africa.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.100
I have in India. Each country
presents its own challenges.

03:24.700 --> 03:30.900
- You need all your confidence.
- I've always wanted to go to Africa.

03:31.100 --> 03:36.000
And, if I may speak personally, my wife
is having our first-born in six months,

03:36.200 --> 03:40.700
and I promised her I'd be there
for the birth. I always keep my word.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.400
Very moving, ColoneI.
I'm touched you've confided in me,

03:45.600 --> 03:49.100
but I really don't give a shit
about your upcoming litter.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.800
I've made you with this assignment.
Don't make me break you.

03:57.500 --> 04:02.400
You won't have the opportunity.
Any other words of encouragement?

04:04.000 --> 04:06.900
Then I have a train to catch.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.200
Tell me about Beaumont. Does
he understand how brilliant you are?

04:23.400 --> 04:26.900
- How lucky he is to have you?
- It was embarrasing.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.200
- The man showered me with praise.
- Oh, dear.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.000
- You get that downtrodden look again.
- No. No.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.700
I'd never have taken this
had we known sooner.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.400
And you'd have been in agony
and it would have been my fault.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.000
You've been desperate to
see Africa all your life.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.800
- There may be difficulties.
- There will be. There always are.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.300
It only means that our son and I...
note my confidence...

04:58.400 --> 05:01.000
...will have an excuse
to come and visit you.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.000
All aboard!

05:05.800 --> 05:08.600
Come along. Put me on the train.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.400
You go.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.300
Such a gentleman.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.600
I am desperate to see Africa,
but it's just a place.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.800
You build bridges, John.
You have to go where the rivers are.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.500
Bye.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.400
- ColoneI Patterson!
- No, thank you.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.600
ColoneI Patterson? Yes?
No, thank you. No, thank you.

06:20.800 --> 06:26.500
Welcome to Africa, sir. Angus Starling.
I'm to assist you at Tsavo.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.200
- Beaumont will have told you that.
- No, actually.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.700
But he did give me his monster speech.

06:32.900 --> 06:38.100
Robert seems dreadfuI but once you
truly get to know him, he's much worse.

06:38.900 --> 06:43.000
And I'm one of his defenders.
Forget him for now. Follow me, sir.

06:43.200 --> 06:48.000
Your first trip to Africa? Good, because
I've reserved the best seats on the train.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.400
They're amazing, aren't they?.

07:18.600 --> 07:24.600
The most amazing thing about them...
They sleep only five minutes a day.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.200
- Don't like them much.
- Their females are bigger.

07:33.400 --> 07:38.900
They have to be or they wouldn't
survive. The males eat the young.

07:52.600 --> 07:56.400
- Anything speciaI about them?
- They fart through their mouths.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.500
I bet they don't kiss very much.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.400
I've lived in Africa for a year
and I don't know what you know.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.900
- How long have you been here?
- Just about 24 hours.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.200
But I've been longing for this
all my life.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.700
Welcome to Tsavo.

09:20.300 --> 09:24.100
SamueI! SamueI is camp liason.
Absolutely indispensable.

09:24.300 --> 09:27.700
- He's the only one everyone trusts.
- Does he speak English?

09:27.800 --> 09:32.400
- And very poor French.
- SamueI, ColoneI John Patterson.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
The bridge builder.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.800
- We've been getting ready for you.
- Good. I'd like to see the site.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.300
I've got some
medicaI supplies to deliver.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.500
- Come to the hospitaI afterwards.
- I'll bring him.

09:48.800 --> 09:53.100
- Where are you from, SamueI?
- That way, beyond those mountains.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.500
I'm from... over there.

10:42.300 --> 10:48.300
- Everything seems to be under controI.
- Thank you. If it is, it's a miracle.

10:48.500 --> 10:53.100
- Why is that?
- The workers don't like each other.

10:53.300 --> 10:58.200
The Africans hate the Indians.
But the Indians also hate other Indians.

10:58.400 --> 11:04.000
The Hindus believe cows are sacred,
while the Muslims eat the cows.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.800
- Do you eat a cow?.
- Of course.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.600
I've worked with both Hindu
and Muslim. Perhaps I can help.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.200
You can try. It won't work.

11:17.400 --> 11:22.600
Nothing works here.
Tsavo is the worst place in the world.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.300
- Advance camp is across there.
- How many workers?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.400
3,000 men laying track.

11:40.600 --> 11:46.000
Your bridge is not yet built, each day
they move two miles further away.

11:58.300 --> 12:04.500
- Did it look like this in your mind?
- No. This is more difficult.

12:05.400 --> 12:11.500
It should be difficult. What betterjob
in all the world than to build a bridge.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.900
To bring land over water.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.100
To bring worlds together.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.500
- Finish your tour?.
- Is this mostly malaria?

12:20.700 --> 12:25.900
Yes, but their suffering is only transitory
once they accept God into their hearts.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.600
That's just vomitus talk, Mr Starling.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.500
Poor bastards will get even sicker
if you don't shut up.

12:34.200 --> 12:39.300
David Hawthorn. I'm...
This is my hospitaI.

12:40.500 --> 12:44.900
And my advice to you is...
don't get sick.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.100
That was meant to be charming.
Seemed to have lost the knack.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.600
- You never had it.
- Angus and I don't like each other.

12:54.800 --> 13:00.600
- I'm also liason between these two.
- You don't share Beaumont's vision.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.800
This is a sham.
Who needs it? It's ridiculous.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.100
It's only being built to protect
the ivory trade. Make rich men richer.

13:10.800 --> 13:15.100
- Then why stay, doctor?.
- Who else would hire me?

13:15.300 --> 13:17.700
Beat you to it, didn't I?

13:17.900 --> 13:22.300
- Dr Hawthorne...
- Oh, yes, I almost forgot.

13:22.500 --> 13:28.100
You may have brought bad luck with
you. This is Karim, one of my orderlies.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.200
He was attacked by a man-eater
earlier today.

13:30.400 --> 13:35.100
You're such a buffoon
you almost forget to mention it?

13:35.300 --> 13:37.000
His injuries are only slight.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.500
He was riding his donkey nearby
when suddenly a lion sprung on them.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.300
Donkey took the brunt of it.
Then the lion ran off.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.100
Thank you, Karim.

13:49.400 --> 13:54.300
I know this is your first day
and you must be tired...

13:55.400 --> 13:58.600
But... what are you gonna do about it?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.200
With any luck,
I'll sort it out this evening.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.600
- Could I come and watch?
- Have you ever hunted?

14:07.800 --> 14:11.700
Well, not exactly.
I've never been very adventurous.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.700
Can you keep quiet?

14:22.400 --> 14:25.200
- I hate to be a bother, John...
- Shh.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.900
The cramp... is getting worse.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.700
The pain is actually...
quite unbearable now.

14:37.900 --> 14:42.200
- You just have to cope with it, Angus.
- That is precisely my plan.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.300
But back at my tent.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.400
You'll be dead before
you ever get to your tent.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.000
- The lion will eat you.
- I know.

14:59.300 --> 15:03.200
- Is this the best way to hunt a lion?
- I don't know.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.800
I've never even seen one.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.000
One shot!

15:57.100 --> 16:01.900
One shot! Patterson
has made the night safe again!

16:15.800 --> 16:18.500
My God, you sorted it out.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.600
There's nothing like the fear
a man-eater brings.

16:25.800 --> 16:29.300
They own the night
and kill so quickly.

16:29.500 --> 16:34.300
It was clear to the men that Patterson
was willing to take risks for them.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.600
That one shot had taken
their fears away.

16:42.000 --> 16:47.900
Angus, I've decided to have you and
Mahina oversee the foundation piers.

16:51.000 --> 16:56.600
Of course, the hardest part about
building a bridge is the foundation piers.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.500
For that task, I'm giving you
four thrilling weeks.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.500
Aren't we full of ourselves today.
I think it's because of the lion.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.700
- Ah, John...
- You know, I also have killed a lion.

17:10.900 --> 17:14.900
- How many shots did you need?
- I used my hands.

17:17.099 --> 17:22.300
- Four weeks is just not enough time.
- You just have to use your hands.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.700
Come in.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.200
One shot.

20:02.900 --> 20:05.400
The claws of the lion you killed.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.500
Thank you.

20:09.700 --> 20:14.300
- It will remind me of Africa.
- It is meant to remind you of courage.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.900
It will also protect you. Wear it.

20:29.500 --> 20:34.300
You know how God invented liquor
so the Irish wouldn't rule the world.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.700
He invented being bull-headed so
we could be the best at something.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.800
For when this bridge is finished,
it'll have nothing to do with my skills

20:43.000 --> 20:49.300
and all to do with my stubbornness.
Africa changes everything I plan.

20:49.400 --> 20:52.400
Yet, we are somehow
ahead of schedule.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.800
Mahina, my foreman, deserves so
much credit. The man is a marvel.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.400
Another marvel. Starling has actually
convinced some natives to convert.

21:02.600 --> 21:08.300
I cannot wait to show this beautiful
country to you. Love, John.

22:44.000 --> 22:49.500
What the lion must have done was lick
his skin off so he could drink his blood.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.900
Then he feasted on him,
starting with his feet.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.700
Lions don't eat this way.
Are you sure this was a lion?

22:58.900 --> 23:01.300
We followed his tracks.

23:03.300 --> 23:07.400
What sort of lion could carry off
someone Mahina's size?

23:23.800 --> 23:28.200
Terror had now built a hole inside us
and would not leave.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.900
Because if Mahina, who was so
powerful, could not save himself

23:33.100 --> 23:35.600
what could the rest of us do?

25:06.800 --> 25:10.100
- They will go when I tell them!
- Sitting accomplishes nothing!

25:10.200 --> 25:13.900
You want us to work
even if we have to die to do it!

25:15.200 --> 25:17.200
Why is there no work being done?

25:18.700 --> 25:24.000
- Malaria epidemic. Very sudden.
- There is no reason for fear.

25:24.800 --> 25:28.900
On that I choose to remain dubious.
Two are dead now in two nights.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.700
- The second?
- Far end of the camp.

25:31.900 --> 25:34.100
A man wandering alone at night.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.300
There's even less of him
than there was of Mahina.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.800
It's too soon for a lion
to kill from hunger.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.500
In our village, we construct thorn bush
fences around where we live.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.300
Big burning fires at night.
That keeps the lion away.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.700
Good. Get started.

25:51.900 --> 25:56.000
And a strict curfew. No one
is allowed out of their tent at night.

25:56.200 --> 26:00.300
Abdullah, send half your men
with SamueI to build these fences.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.400
Take the other half to the bridge.
I'll sort this out.

26:03.600 --> 26:07.300
- I will kill the lion and build the bridge.
- Of course you will.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.000
You're white. You can do anything.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.400
It would be a mistake not to work
together on this thing, Abdullah.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.900
Go back to work!

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
No! It's got to be tighter!

26:51.300 --> 26:54.300
See? This has got to be a wall!

27:07.200 --> 27:10.300
- What a good week.
- You mean nobody died?

27:10.500 --> 27:14.900
We all worked together.
Worthy deeds were accomplished.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.500
I like the labour.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.800
My mother insisted on piano lessons.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.900
Broke the dear woman's heart
when it turned out I was tone deaf.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.900
She was always on at me
to be carefuI with my hands.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.900
I like the blood. Is that so strange?

27:35.400 --> 27:39.300
- No.
- Oh, yes. I think so.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.900
Here it comes, SamueI.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.100
Even you two must admit,
it's glorious what man can accomplish.

27:47.300 --> 27:50.300
With one common splendid goaI,
there are no limits.

27:50.500 --> 27:54.100
Think what will be done when we all
have God's warmth in our hearts.

27:58.100 --> 28:00.800
I am immune to your disdain.

28:02.800 --> 28:08.100
When I came, I had one small goaI:
to convert the entire continent of Africa.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.100
Now I've decided to move on
to something really difficult.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.400
I will not rest untiI both of you
are safely in the fold.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.300
I'm beyond conversion.

28:17.500 --> 28:20.400
My mother's a Roman Catholic
and my father's a Protestant.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.100
I have four wives.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.700
Good luck.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.900
The struggle is the glory.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.100
- For you.
- Thank you, SamueI.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.100
- Good news.
- I expect so. It's from my wife.

29:15.200 --> 29:19.500
- You like her?.
- Very much.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.300
I don't like any of mine.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.500
Hassan!

29:43.500 --> 29:46.500
Darling. The big excitement
yesterday was

29:46.700 --> 29:49.800
when some school children
spotted a whale.

29:50.000 --> 29:56.900
They saw me. An attempt at humour,
but I don't feel funny these days.

29:57.100 --> 30:01.100
Anyway, after our son... you'll
note I still have total confidence.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.300
After he's born, travel
might be the order of the day.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.300
As he kicks me at night,
I'm quite sure he's telling me...

30:09.500 --> 30:15.600
He definitely wants to come to Africa.
Thought you might need reminding.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.700
Move yourselves!

31:09.600 --> 31:11.700
Angus! Stay here.

32:42.300 --> 32:45.800
Jesus... There's two of them.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.600
I told you to be careful.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.700
"And the king said to DanieI,
'DanieI, servant of the living God',"

33:03.900 --> 33:09.100
"'is thy God whom thou servest,
able to deliver thee from the lions?"'

33:09.300 --> 33:11.700
"And DanieI said unto the king,
'Oh, King, live forever. "'

33:11.800 --> 33:15.000
"'My God hath sent his angeI and
hath shut the lions' mouths"'

33:15.200 --> 33:19.900
"'that they have not hurt me, forasmuch
innocence was found in me,"'

33:20.000 --> 33:24.100
"'and as before thee, oh King,
have I done no hurt. "'

33:24.300 --> 33:26.700
"'Have I done no hurt. "'

33:28.800 --> 33:32.200
The men called them
the Ghost and the Darkness.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.900
There were two of them, and
that had never happened before

33:36.000 --> 33:39.200
because man-eaters
are always alone.

33:39.400 --> 33:43.800
They owned the night but
they also attacked in daylight.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.900
Alone or together.
Without fear or reason.

33:48.100 --> 33:50.400
Some thought
they were not lions at all,

33:50.600 --> 33:54.600
but the spirits of dead medicine men
come back to spread madness.

33:54.800 --> 34:00.000
Or they were the devil sent to stop
the white man from owning the world.

34:00.200 --> 34:04.100
I believed this... that they were evil.

34:04.300 --> 34:07.100
What better ground
for evil to walk than Tsavo?

34:07.300 --> 34:12.699
Because this is what the word Tsavo
means; "a place of slaughter".

34:19.000 --> 34:23.500
- You didn't say help is on the way?.
- It's too late now.

34:23.699 --> 34:26.199
They will listen to you.
Make them stay.

34:26.400 --> 34:32.000
They are afraid. They want to go home.
Be content that I have decided to stay.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.300
Beaumont is on that train.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.500
- If he sees this, you'II lose yourjob.
- So will you, sir.

34:41.600 --> 34:45.000
That's all you really care about.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.300
Oh... Christ.

34:54.100 --> 34:57.100
Then you go, too.
You lack the courage to lead.

34:57.300 --> 34:59.700
Go, tell all your men to go.

34:59.900 --> 35:06.100
But I will kill the lions
and I will build the bridge. And you...

35:06.200 --> 35:10.900
...you must go home and tell the wives of
the men who died working here...

35:12.100 --> 35:15.200
...that you fled with the others
because you couldn't master your fear.

35:36.700 --> 35:42.700
- Welcome to Tsavo. Pleasant journey?.
- How could it be? I hate Africa.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.500
Lovely sound. They seem happy.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.500
- Don't they though?
- So, work's going well?

35:58.400 --> 36:02.900
- What of the soldiers?
- You're on your own. No soldiers here.

36:03.100 --> 36:05.900
- I promised my men protection.
- Where's Starling?

36:06.000 --> 36:09.400
He ordered some Bibles. Is he here?

36:12.400 --> 36:15.700
- Where is he? Where's Starling?
- Here he comes.

36:25.200 --> 36:28.400
- What happened?
- I'll show you.

36:34.700 --> 36:37.700
Nothing wrong with these people!

36:37.900 --> 36:40.200
- They're afraid.
- What the hell is going on?

36:41.600 --> 36:45.800
- The Ghost and the Darkness came.
- In English.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.100
It's what the natives
are calling the lions.

36:50.200 --> 36:54.000
There's a legend here. Two man-eaters
are making all the trouble.

36:54.200 --> 36:58.500
- I thought you were a hunter.
- It's not that simple.

36:59.900 --> 37:04.300
These lions are... not like lions.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.900
How many have they killed?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.100
About 30, I should think.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.500
Christ!

37:15.700 --> 37:20.100
You've been here three months
and already you're behind schedule.

37:20.300 --> 37:23.900
Don't you know the French
and the Germans are right behind you?

37:24.000 --> 37:28.900
And I don't care about you,
and I don't care about the 30 dead.

37:29.700 --> 37:34.600
I care about my knighthood!
As to your request for troops...

37:36.100 --> 37:39.200
Do we wish the world to think that
the builders of the British Empire

37:39.400 --> 37:45.100
are afraid to do theirjob because of
minor difficulties with the locaI wildIife?

37:46.000 --> 37:49.500
I don't think so.
So, what are you planning to do?

37:53.500 --> 37:56.300
I'm calling it my "contraption".

37:56.500 --> 38:01.600
I placed it here because this is the area
where the lions have attacked the most.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.500
I'm surrounding it
with a boma. A fence.

38:07.100 --> 38:10.300
Except for this small area here,
opposite this door.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.300
Just what kind of lunacy
are we dealing with here?

38:22.800 --> 38:27.700
On the other side of these bars
will be bait. Human bait.

38:27.800 --> 38:32.600
About here will be a trip wire
to this sliding door.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.700
Genius! The beast will enter,
tripping the wire,

38:38.900 --> 38:40.800
the door will slide down behind him,
trapping him.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.600
You, meanwhile, safe behind your bars
will have the beast at your mercy,

38:45.800 --> 38:49.700
and will shoot him at your leisure.

38:51.300 --> 38:53.900
Are you running a high fever, man?

38:54.000 --> 38:57.200
How could you conceive of
something so idiotic?

38:57.400 --> 39:00.700
I didn't conceive it for the lions.
It was for a tiger in India.

39:00.900 --> 39:02.200
And did it work?.

39:03.600 --> 39:08.000
In point of fact, it didn't.
But I'm convinced the theory is sound.

39:09.900 --> 39:15.900
I made a mistake hiring you.
I need initiative, not contraptions.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.600
I need a professionaI hunter.
I assume you've heard of Remington.

39:21.800 --> 39:25.700
Every hunter has heard of him.
I wish he were here right now.

39:25.900 --> 39:30.100
By the time you find him, the lions will
be dead and I'll be back on schedule.

39:35.100 --> 39:40.100
The job's still yours, but only because
it'd take too long to find a replacement.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.500
If I have to return, you are finished.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.900
I will then do everything within
my power to destroy your reputation.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.900
Fair enough?

39:50.500 --> 39:53.400
I told you you'd hate me.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.000
Helena.
Everything's collapsing on me.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.600
Every morning
the ground is soaked with blood.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.500
The workers feel I brought this terror,
since it didn't begin until my arrival.

40:03.700 --> 40:09.100
Whatever I try, they seem to know.
All the deaths are on me.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.200
- Very impressive.
- We've been hunting since childhood.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.800
You're murderers. Criminals.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.500
That's good.
You'll spend your nights in there.

40:24.700 --> 40:29.600
- And you have nothing to fear.
- That is correct. Nothing.

42:51.300 --> 42:56.400
Of course he kept moving! Did you
want him to sit down and pose?!

42:56.600 --> 42:59.700
This worked.
He came in and hit the wire.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.700
He was about 15 feet away
from the three of you!

43:02.900 --> 43:06.700
You couldn't even wound it!
I should've given you rocks!

43:07.400 --> 43:10.300
- Not a trace of blood anywhere.
- This is insane.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.200
- We came close many times.
- There must be blood.

43:13.400 --> 43:19.200
- Next time we'll be better.
- The deviI has come to Tsavo!

43:19.400 --> 43:21.800
Ridiculous talk.
You don't really believe it.

43:22.000 --> 43:27.800
- You're telling me my beliefs!
- I wasn't and you know it. Don't force it!

43:31.200 --> 43:37.200
- We do have a problem in Tsavo.
- Yes. Finally we agree. You're right.

43:37.800 --> 43:42.100
We do. We do.
You are the problem in Tsavo!

43:45.100 --> 43:47.600
He's the problem in Tsavo!

43:49.900 --> 43:53.500
- Be carefuI!
- You don't tell me carefuI!

43:53.700 --> 43:56.900
You don't tell me anything!

43:57.700 --> 44:00.900
We are sick and tired of your lies!

44:01.100 --> 44:04.700
You listen while I talk!

44:04.900 --> 44:08.700
Change in plans.
Get them back! Get them all back!

44:08.800 --> 44:10.900
Get them back!

44:14.300 --> 44:16.700
Go back! Quickly, go back!

44:16.900 --> 44:20.100
Go back! Go back! Go back!

44:22.300 --> 44:27.900
You listen while I talk, because you
got a question that needs answering.

44:28.600 --> 44:33.300
- Will I pull this trigger?.
- You don't know what has happened.

44:33.500 --> 44:37.100
- He will pull the trigger.
- The deviI has come to Tsavo!

44:37.200 --> 44:42.600
You're right. The deviI has come
to Tsavo. Look at me!

44:42.800 --> 44:45.500
I am the deviI.

44:47.700 --> 44:49.400
I'm a man of peace!

44:51.600 --> 44:57.400
- You are a man who wants to live.
- Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.100
That's an excellent decision.

45:01.100 --> 45:03.600
- Your name is Abdullah.
- Yes.

45:03.800 --> 45:09.100
- I'm sure we're gonna meet again.
- I think it's been a pleasure.

45:15.200 --> 45:18.600
- You have returned.
- My friend.

45:18.800 --> 45:24.500
- How have you been?
- I am well.

45:31.700 --> 45:34.700
Warriors!

46:11.500 --> 46:15.100
I will need ten cows.

46:16.300 --> 46:18.700
- John Patterson?
- Aye.

46:23.700 --> 46:29.200
Remington uses the Masai to hunt
lions. It'll cost you ten head of cattle.

46:29.400 --> 46:31.700
He takes some getting used to.

46:35.400 --> 46:39.700
- Why didn't you tell me you knew him?
- You did not ask.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.500
I didn't get a chance to thank you.

46:47.700 --> 46:50.700
- What did I do?
- You got me out of trouble.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.600
SamueI was there.
He would've done something for you.

46:55.600 --> 46:59.900
- What was that all about anyway?.
- There are over forty dead.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.300
Forty?. That's amazing.

47:03.400 --> 47:07.100
- There's something you should know...
- Let me save you some time.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.800
You're in charge of building the bridge.
Am I right so far?.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.500
- That's right.
- I don't want to be in charge of it.

47:14.600 --> 47:19.300
- That's fine...
- I'm sure you hate Tsavo like I do.

47:19.500 --> 47:24.000
And knowing Beaumount, you're not
the imbecile that he says you are.

47:25.100 --> 47:27.400
So what do you say
we help each other?.

47:27.600 --> 47:30.400
I help you by killing the lions
and then leaving.

47:30.600 --> 47:36.500
You help me by doing what I say so I
can leave. You see a problem with that?

47:36.700 --> 47:41.500
- Actually, no.
- Let us prepare for battle.

47:50.400 --> 47:55.100
First thing I propose is a new hospitaI.
I want it built by tomorrow night.

47:55.300 --> 47:59.900
- What? That's a terrible idea.
- Sorry. You must be the doctor, right?

48:00.100 --> 48:02.500
I'm sure you know what's best.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.700
That's the most infantile thing
I've ever heard in my life!

48:05.900 --> 48:09.300
Whoever you are, would you tell me
why we should go through all that?

48:11.300 --> 48:14.700
I could explain but with
the scent of flesh and blood in here

48:14.800 --> 48:17.100
makes for an inviting target.

48:17.200 --> 48:19.900
I could tell you I just saw
fresh paw prints out there,

48:20.100 --> 48:23.700
which makes me think they're already
thinking about feasting in here.

48:23.800 --> 48:25.300
But I don't wanna answer you.

48:25.500 --> 48:30.000
When you question me, you're saying
that I don't know what I'm doing!

48:30.200 --> 48:34.200
Anybody here think I'm a fooI,
then please speak up right now!

48:36.800 --> 48:38.900
ColoneI Patterson?

48:42.700 --> 48:44.100
Well, then I guess we all agree.

49:09.400 --> 49:14.700
- I'll need you with me tomorrow.
- Whatever you wish.

49:19.800 --> 49:24.100
- SamueI says you killed a lion.
- Probably just luck.

49:25.600 --> 49:30.100
Nobody kills a lion with one shot by
luck. You might be usefuI tomorrow.

49:30.300 --> 49:37.100
Even if you're not, understand that
this may take me 2-3 days to sort out.

49:37.200 --> 49:42.400
You have to build that bridge so the
men can't lose their respect for you.

49:42.600 --> 49:46.000
- That's very considerate of you.
- I'm a very considerate man.

49:46.200 --> 49:48.400
My mother taught me that.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.900
What are you laughing about?
You don't agree?

49:55.100 --> 49:57.900
I don't believe you had a mother.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.500
Now we're ready.

50:22.500 --> 50:26.900
You really believe
you can make something happen?

50:29.500 --> 50:31.500
But you're not excited.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.900
You don't enjoy killing, do you?

50:39.600 --> 50:41.800
Then why do it?

50:43.200 --> 50:45.800
Because I've got a gift.

50:48.400 --> 50:50.400
I'm gonna join them now.

50:50.600 --> 50:54.900
We're gonna try and convince
each other that we're still brave.

50:55.600 --> 50:58.100
I wouldn't have thought
bravery would be a problem for you.

50:58.300 --> 51:03.400
You hope each time it won't be.
But you never really know.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.200
Strange man.

51:14.900 --> 51:20.900
Two great tribes of his country fought
a terrible civiI war for many years.

51:21.100 --> 51:25.300
- And his side lost?
- Everything. Land and family.

51:26.500 --> 51:31.800
The very young ones
and the very old ones. AII lost.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.900
He buried his family
and left his country forever.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.600
Now he hunts all over the world
but he always returns here.

51:40.800 --> 51:44.000
He says Africa is the last good place.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.800
John?

51:48.800 --> 51:52.700
Will you exchange weapons with me?
Mine's much more powerfuI.

51:52.900 --> 51:57.500
I won't be with you tomorrow.
I'll be finishing the new hospitaI.

52:00.100 --> 52:02.100
Thank you.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.900
- Why does he need you with him?
- He doesn't.

52:12.100 --> 52:17.600
We've hunted many times.
He knows I'm afraid of lions.

53:30.900 --> 53:34.800
I've spotted one of them in the thicket.
SamueI, come with me.

54:23.300 --> 54:26.600
Chances are
I'm gonna kill that lion in the thicket.

54:26.800 --> 54:32.200
ColoneI, take the higher position there.
You'll have a clear shot at him.

58:04.700 --> 58:06.800
Shoot him.

58:09.800 --> 58:11.100
Shoot him.

58:16.100 --> 58:18.700
Shoot him! Goddamnit! Shoot him!

58:21.200 --> 58:22.800
Shoot him!

58:34.000 --> 58:36.400
- What happened?
- I don't know.

58:36.600 --> 58:41.300
- What do you mean you don't know?.
- It misfired.

58:41.400 --> 58:44.000
For the first time?

58:45.600 --> 58:48.500
The gun belongs to Dr Hawthorne.

58:53.300 --> 58:55.600
You exchanged weapons?

58:57.200 --> 59:00.600
You went into battle
with an unproven rifle?

59:08.000 --> 59:11.200
They've got an expression
in prize fighting.

59:11.400 --> 59:15.300
"Everybody's got a plan untiI
they've been hit. " Well, my friend...

59:15.500 --> 59:19.000
You've just been hit.
The getting up...

59:20.000 --> 59:21.900
That's up to you.

59:32.800 --> 59:37.500
They say they're leaving now
because it does no good to be here.

59:37.700 --> 59:41.800
They are not lions.
They are the Ghost and the Darkness.

59:49.800 --> 59:53.200
The Masai did not see a lion.
They saw the devil.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.400
They knew there was not enough
blood in all the world

59:56.600 --> 59:59.900
to make these demons stop drinking.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.900
Remington laughed at us.
He said that they were only lions.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.200
Gentlemen, there is no
smell of sickness and very little blood.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.300
We have removed
all the lions' temptations.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.300
When we leave this evening, lock
this gate securely untiI the morning.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.900
Keep those fires burning high.
Are there any questions?

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.200
Aren't there any questions?

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.000
You two sleep beautifully in your tent
and stay there.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.600
And where will you two
sleep beautifully?.

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:39.600
We will spend the night waiting
in the old hospitaI. Won't we, ColoneI?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.900
And I can assure you,
with the fresh scent of blood,

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.800
those lions are gonna find it irresistible.

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.900
Just think about something else.

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.400
- Have you ever failed?
- Only in life.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.600
I meant to ask you, that trap you set
in the boxcar... Was that your idea?

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.800
- Aye.
- Excellent notion.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.300
- I used the same device myself once.
- But, of course, yours worked.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:26.000
No, in point of fact it didn't.
But it was still a good idea.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.300
Johnny... Get the lock.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.300
- We must not leave!
- That's my hospitaI, for God's sake!

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.500
- We must not leave!
- Let me go, SamueI.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.500
Hurry up!

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.600
One of us needs to be brave.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:24.200
It would've been a beautifuI bridge.
It's funny how I didn't notice it before.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.100
I guess I had
some other things on my mind.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.400
Not actually something
I would appreciate, but...

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:37.100
I got up this morning and...
It's just such a pretty design.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.300
The setting's so beautifuI...

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.900
You've just been hit.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.800
Yeah.

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.200
The getting up is up to you.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.400
They're only lions.

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.600
Yeah, yeah, they're only lions.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.300
Well, I just saw some fresh paw prints
heading up that way.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.900
So I guess we've both been hit.

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:21.600
Let's go after them.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.300
When I was growing up,
there was a bully in my hometown.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:42.800
He used to terrorise everybody.
But he wasn't the problem.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.300
He had a brother who was worse
than him. He wasn't the problem, either.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.400
One or the other was always in jaiI.
Problem was when they were together.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:58.700
Alone they were just bullies,
but together... they were lethaI.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.000
- They were reaI killers.
- What happened to them?

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:05.300
Well, I got bigger.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.100
Oh, my God.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.200
Holy Christ.

01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:23.200
Lions don't do this.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:28.300
Lions... never have a lair like this.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.900
They're doing it for the pleasure.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.900
- They'll know we've been here.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.500
- Both of them.
- Yeah, it's both of them.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.700
- Have you ever used a machan?
- A what?

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.100
- A machan.
- Is it something you learnt in India?

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.200
I figure
they got used to me in trees, so...

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.300
if we... put this in a clearing...

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.100
I'm not quite sure of the scale.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.500
- It might be too small for the both of us.
- No, it won't.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.100
I ain't gonna be there. This is
your idea, you get up on that thing.

01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.800
So, you want me to be bait alone.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.700
That's right. I'm gonna be in some tree
too far away to protect you.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.300
Now, can you controI your fear?.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.200
I suppose I'll have to.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.300
Lions hate the sound of a baboon.

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.300
Anything to make
your evening more enjoyable.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:27.300
Hey, this here's for you.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.300
You might need it.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
This certainly is the best opportunity
those lions have had to kill you.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.500
Good luck.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.600
Including the workers that I've lost
and your knowledge of man-eaters,

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.700
- how many do you think they've killed?
- More than any other lion.

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:15.700
A hundred. Maybe more.

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:18.900
But you know something?
I do believe this is going to work.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.200
- Why?.
- Because I think they're after you.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.700
- Oh, Merry Christmas.
- What?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.700
Oh, yeah, this is the month.

01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:02.600
Excuse me.
Why on earth do you laugh?

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.800
Because he's just like
one of those bullies now.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.200
He's alone for the first time
and he's afraid.

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:16.400
Somehow,
I don't think he's afraid of me.

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:24.300
I just keep wondering
if we're gonna remember all this.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.800
I love Africa. I could never forget her.

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.200
You're young, Johnny, I mean...

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.300
So many things flash by
and at that moment you say,

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.500
"Oh, yeah, this is gonna
stay with me. Surely... "

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.700
"I will never forget this dawn...
this hunt... "

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
"... this passion", and then...

01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.300
It's all gone.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.000
Well, I hope it stays here.

01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:03.900
- Another toast.
- To memory.

01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.700
To memory.

01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:14.500
I wanted to remember
building the railroad, the iron snake.

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:20.100
I was so excited.
And now, I can't think why.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.900
I know why I wanted to build the bridge,

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.400
but I can tell you the memory
I wanted most.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.600
To see my son come into the world.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:39.700
To bring worlds together.
Now...

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:48.700
Well, my life was shaped because
someone invented gunpowder and...

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:51.300
It took me around the world.

01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:56.500
The memory that I wanted...

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.400
That was the family that I lost.

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.500
You know, Charles...

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.100
You're a rather cheerfuI fellow
when you get to know you.

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.400
Well, I should've warned you.
Good night.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.600
Oh, Johnny...

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.700
When you meet your son,
you hold him high.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.300
Excuse me.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.300
- I'd like to see John Patterson, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:02.700
Could you tell him that his wife...
that his family has come to see him.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.800
Sorry.

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.000
Hello! Hello, darling!

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.700
No.

01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:49.500
- Hello...
- Helena!

01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:55.700
- I can see you!
- Go back! Go back!

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:02.400
No! Go back!

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:11.600
- Go back!
- Hello!

01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.100
No, Charles...

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.600
Oh, God.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.200
Charles!

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.800
Charles!

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.900
John!

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.000
Where do you think you're going?

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.600
I'm gonna sort it out.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.700
I'm going to sort it out.

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:21.800
Get down! Get down, John!

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.100
Down!

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.100
John!

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:21.300
ColoneI Patterson?

01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.700
ColoneI Patterson.

01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.200
My name is NigeI Bransford.
I'm here to replace Angus Starling.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:33.300
I'm so proud to meet you.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.900
Patterson the lion killer.
I do wish I'd been here for the hunt.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.800
- No, you don't.
- John.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:44.000
- Excuse me. You have a visitor.
- My child?

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:51.700
Welcome to Tsavo, NigeI.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.800
Patterson did hold his son high.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000
People came back.
Patterson finished the bridge.

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.500
People went their ways.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.200
If you want to see the lions today,
you must go to America.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:18.000
They are at the Field Museum
in Chicago, lllinois.

01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:24.900
Even now, if you dare lock eyes
with them, you will be afraid.
