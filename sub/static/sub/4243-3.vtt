WEBVTT

00:02.016 --> 00:04.048
where he's rooming with Rachel
and planning to interview

00:04.049 --> 00:06.504
for Vogue.com. Rachel's friend,
Brody, totally wants

00:06.505 --> 00:08.023
to date her, but she's still
confused about Finn,

00:08.025 --> 00:10.004
and Finn's still in the army,
and nobody's heard from him.

00:10.005 --> 00:11.583
- Glee!
- Back at McKinley,

00:11.584 --> 00:13.315
Mr. Schue's trying to repeat
a win at nationals

00:13.316 --> 00:14.583
by repeating assignments from last year.

00:14.584 --> 00:16.538
- Are we doing Britney week again?
- That's great.

00:16.541 --> 00:18.541
And Sam's new blonde
besties with Brittany,

00:18.542 --> 00:20.523
who didn't graduate and thinks
she's still president even

00:20.524 --> 00:22.506
though all she accomplished last year
was a dinosaur prom.

00:22.507 --> 00:23.558
That's what you missed on Glee.

00:28.499 --> 00:29.602
All right, Blaine Anderson,

00:29.603 --> 00:30.550
time to change things up.

00:30.551 --> 00:32.503
Last year, it was all

00:32.503 --> 00:33.558
about letting the seniors shine.

00:33.559 --> 00:36.557
But this year...

00:36.558 --> 00:38.571
it's your turn.

01:40.676 --> 01:43.553
is to fill my days

01:43.554 --> 01:45.548
We talk and Skype and text
as much as possible,

01:45.549 --> 01:47.515
but the only time we're really in sync

01:47.516 --> 01:49.498
is when we're hate-watching
Treme together.

01:49.499 --> 01:50.533

What do you think you're doing,
Blaine Warbler?

02:34.500 --> 02:35.542
I'm running for president.

02:41.538 --> 02:43.567
I've spent the entire
weekend trying to choose

02:43.568 --> 02:46.499
the absolute perfect outfit because

02:46.500 --> 02:47.521
I've snagged an interview at...

02:47.522 --> 02:49.516
drum roll, please...

02:49.517 --> 02:50.517
Hi, I'm Kurt Hummel.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.499
Vogue.com.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.516
Yes, it's just for an internship,

02:54.517 --> 02:56.550
but I haven't been this nervous
since I auditioned for NYADA,

02:56.551 --> 02:59.532
and we all know how that turned out.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.566
I'm meeting with the new senior editor

03:01.567 --> 03:04.532
and designer extraordinaire.
Isabelle Wright,

03:04.533 --> 03:06.502
and her stellar reputation precedes her.

03:06.503 --> 03:07.548
She's a style maverick.

03:07.549 --> 03:09.502
She double-majored
in fashion design

03:09.503 --> 03:10.500
and dead romance languages.

03:10.501 --> 03:11.571
- An iconoclast.
- Rumor has it,

03:11.574 --> 03:14.503
She gave Steve Jobs
his first black turtleneck.

03:14.504 --> 03:15.550
She's Vogue's rogue.

03:15.551 --> 03:18.504
Miss Wright will see you now.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.508
Hello?

03:24.517 --> 03:25.532
Columbus.

03:25.533 --> 03:26.567
- Excuse me?
- You're from Lima.

03:26.570 --> 03:28.516
I'm from Columbus.

03:28.517 --> 03:29.542
And actually, I once got

03:29.543 --> 03:31.549
food poisoning in Lima

03:31.550 --> 03:32.548
at some Italian place,

03:32.549 --> 03:33.571
It was Bread...

03:33.572 --> 03:35.321
- Stix?
- Breadstix, yes.

03:35.322 --> 03:36.548
I can't believe you ate at Breadstix.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.550
Well, I wish I hadn't.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.541
Isabelle Wright.

03:39.542 --> 03:40.549
Kurt Hummel.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.499
So, Mr. Hummel,

03:42.500 --> 03:44.566
I have to tell you,
I am very impressed

03:44.567 --> 03:45.575
with your online resume,

03:45.576 --> 03:49.566
especially this gallery of you

03:49.567 --> 03:53.503
and your rather bold
clothing choices.

03:53.504 --> 03:56.504
- Where did you find all this?
- Well, I.. I made most of them,

03:56.507 --> 03:58.507
And searched the
Internet for bargains.

03:58.508 --> 04:01.557
And, uh, that half-sweater there
at the bottom, that belonged

04:01.558 --> 04:04.516
to my dead aunt, and I
found it in her attic.

04:04.517 --> 04:06.499
And the embroidered calico vest

04:06.500 --> 04:08.549
was actually inspired
by one of your designs.

04:08.550 --> 04:11.516
Oh, yes,

04:11.517 --> 04:13.516
my quilted micro skirt collection.

04:13.517 --> 04:16.499
It was an epic fail.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.507
But like you said in Vanity Fair,

04:18.507 --> 04:21.516
"I don't trust anyone who hasn't
failed big at least once."

04:21.517 --> 04:22.516
Have a seat.

04:22.517 --> 04:23.583
So, I'm just gonna ask you

04:23.584 --> 04:26.566
a couple of routine questions
I ask all potential hires.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.516
Who are your fashion icons?

04:28.517 --> 04:29.519
Audrey Hepburn,

04:29.520 --> 04:30.542
Michelle Obama,

04:30.543 --> 04:32.516
and not to kiss up or anything,

04:32.517 --> 04:33.591
but... you.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.591
And have you done
any writing on fashion?

04:37.592 --> 04:40.532
Self journaling, mostly.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.532
I did weekly updates

04:42.533 --> 04:45.516
and, um, blogs on Project Runway

04:45.517 --> 04:46.533
since season one,

04:46.534 --> 04:48.054
- and...
- Wave your magic wand,

04:48.057 --> 04:49.574
Where would you be in four years?

04:50.575 --> 04:52.499
Working here part-time,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.532
graduating from NYADA

04:54.533 --> 04:56.516
and, uh,

04:56.517 --> 04:57.571
starting my first Broadway show.

04:57.572 --> 04:59.532
I know that sounds presumptuous.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.591
No.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.587
Frankly, you should be
more presumptuous, you know?

05:03.588 --> 05:06.507
This is New York;
It's for dreamers.

05:06.508 --> 05:08.521
It's for people like you,
who are just starting out,

05:08.522 --> 05:10.587
and people like me who...

05:10.588 --> 05:13.520
very much want
to re-invent themselves.

05:13.521 --> 05:16.503
No, you should dream.
You should dream very, very big.

05:16.504 --> 05:17.783
And then you should work
incredibly hard

05:17.784 --> 05:21.524
and make sure you do everything
in your power to make it happen.

05:21.525 --> 05:24.503
Look, Anna hired me because she said

05:24.504 --> 05:25.638
that the Web sites that I designed

05:25.639 --> 05:27.520
for my collections were inspired.

05:27.521 --> 05:29.524
So neither myself nor my team

05:29.525 --> 05:31.566
can let her down,

05:32.567 --> 05:33.582
and that includes you.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.550
- Me?
- Well, listen,

05:35.553 --> 05:39.549
My friend, anybody who can
pull off a hippo brooch

05:39.550 --> 05:41.591
deserves to be here.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.537
So welcome to Vogue.com.

05:44.538 --> 05:47.516
Thank you. Thank you so...

05:47.517 --> 05:48.650
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Sorry.

05:48.653 --> 05:50.524
It's okay. It's okay.

05:50.525 --> 05:52.499
That should come with a warning.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.537
Oh, it did.

05:53.538 --> 05:56.503
Artie, can I talk
to you for a second?

05:56.504 --> 05:57.756
Okay, so I'm running for senior class

05:57.757 --> 05:59.550
president again, and I
want you to be my VP.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.537
Being vice presidential pick

06:01.538 --> 06:03.498
of McKinley High's
first two-term president

06:03.499 --> 06:04.988
would look really good
on your college resume.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.537
I have a 4.0 GPA,

06:06.538 --> 06:08.523
and I scored a 210
on my practice SAT,

06:08.524 --> 06:10.298
and I was the only
handi-capable member

06:10.299 --> 06:11.536
of a national championship glee club.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.536
I'm not really worried
about getting into college.

06:13.537 --> 06:15.552
I know how people like you are
afraid of the spotlight sometimes,

06:15.553 --> 06:17.554
but did you know that Franklin
Roosevelt was part robot, too,

06:17.555 --> 06:20.500
- and he's on Mount Rushmore?
- No, he isn't.

06:20.503 --> 06:22.507
And I'm just going to say it again,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.500
- I'm not part robot.
- I realize

06:25.501 --> 06:26.952
That I didn't do much
as president last year,

06:26.953 --> 06:28.548
and if you help me
win again this year,

06:28.549 --> 06:30.550
I promise to do exactly
the same thing, which means

06:30.551 --> 06:33.549
I'll be president, and you can
make all the boring decisions.

06:33.550 --> 06:35.587
So I could be Cheney to your Bush.

06:35.588 --> 06:37.407
I'd rather be landing strip.

06:37.408 --> 06:38.590
I mean, it's no secret that a woman

06:38.591 --> 06:40.586
loves a man in power,
and don't take this personally,

06:40.587 --> 06:42.569
but before I graduate,
I would like to have

06:42.570 --> 06:44.571
a relationship that lasts longer
than a couple weeks.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.507
Why would I take that personally?

06:46.508 --> 06:47.508
- You and I dated.
- We did?

06:47.511 --> 06:49.566
Look, you've got yourself a deal.

06:49.567 --> 06:52.517
Cool.

06:52.518 --> 06:54.506
Okay, as you all know,
as national champions

06:54.507 --> 06:56.583
we get to host the annual Show
Choir Rules Committee meeting.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.099
Please tell me you're gonna ask
what 1/3 vintage meant last year?

06:59.100 --> 07:00.565
Or like, why some teams get
to sing six songs

07:00.566 --> 07:01.583
and other ones only do one?

07:01.584 --> 07:03.532
Speaking of competitions,

07:03.533 --> 07:05.498
shouldn't we start like,
preparing for ours?

07:05.499 --> 07:06.542
I have some ideas

07:06.543 --> 07:08.583
which I am working on very hard.

07:10.554 --> 07:12.537
Um...

07:12.538 --> 07:14.566
I don't really want

07:14.567 --> 07:16.504
to give anything away right now...

07:16.505 --> 07:18.507
I have no ideas. I'm tapped out.

07:18.508 --> 07:20.500
I spent all last weekend
trying to think of something

07:20.501 --> 07:22.541
for us to perform,
and all I came up with

07:22.542 --> 07:26.507
was a scat version of "Carmina Burana."

07:26.508 --> 07:28.500
- Yes, go ahead.
- Excuse me, I'm not sure if what

07:28.501 --> 07:30.475
You were saying was actually
important 'cause I wasn't listening

07:30.476 --> 07:32.499
but I'd like to make an announcement.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.502
First, I'd like to know
if anyone can prove that Blaine

07:34.503 --> 07:35.621
was actually born in this country.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.399
Second, I'm wrapping up the election

07:38.400 --> 07:39.567
by selecting Artie
as my running mate.

07:39.568 --> 07:40.582
Ah! All right.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.516
I think by bridging

07:42.517 --> 07:44.516
the human-slash-robot
divide, we'll ensure

07:44.517 --> 07:46.554
that both students and vending
machines will be voting for us.

07:46.555 --> 07:48.504
- Still not a robot.
- Brittany, that's not fair.

07:48.505 --> 07:49.523
This isn't a popularity contest,

07:49.524 --> 07:50.681
it's about who's got the best ideas.

07:50.682 --> 07:52.498
It's about believing
you can make a change, right?

07:52.499 --> 07:53.521
What is that taste

07:53.522 --> 07:55.516
in my...?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.532
Is that sour grape?

07:57.533 --> 07:59.508
Brittany.

08:04.521 --> 08:06.550
- Hey, butt-chin.
- Hey, Sue.

08:06.551 --> 08:08.523
I'm making a list of potential themes

08:08.524 --> 08:09.548
for our set list at sectionals,

08:09.549 --> 08:10.567
and right now I can't decide

08:10.568 --> 08:12.520
between classic TV theme songs

08:12.521 --> 08:13.575
or a salute to autumn.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.524
William, those are terrible.

08:15.525 --> 08:16.665
I don't know what's wrong with me.

08:16.666 --> 08:18.531
What happened to all my good ideas?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.552
Oh, don't kid yourself; you
never had any good ideas.

08:20.553 --> 08:22.540
You just didn't notice
because you were too busy

08:22.541 --> 08:24.531
chasing your bizarre childhood dream

08:24.532 --> 08:26.517
of a glee club national championship.

08:26.518 --> 08:29.399
And now that that's over,
well, you're waking up

08:29.400 --> 08:30.523
to the incessant
mind-numbing tedium

08:30.524 --> 08:33.566
that is the day-to-day life
of a schoolteacher.

08:33.567 --> 08:35.515
Take a look around you, William,

08:35.517 --> 08:36.567
at this sad panoply

08:36.568 --> 08:38.499
of walking human garbage.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.515
This is what you have
to look forward to.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.533
In a few short years,

08:41.534 --> 08:44.553
you'll either be an alcoholic...

08:44.554 --> 08:46.574
morbidly obese...

08:46.575 --> 08:49.553
or both.

08:49.554 --> 08:52.516
That's what I like to call
the Full Charlotte Rae.

08:52.517 --> 08:54.500
Personally, William,
I think you should take

08:54.501 --> 08:56.507
this opportunity to
bow out gracefully

08:56.508 --> 08:58.532
and explore other job opportunities.

08:58.533 --> 09:01.516
Now, your penchant for
bland, simplistic aphorisms

09:01.517 --> 09:02.548
could give you a leg up

09:02.549 --> 09:04.171
in the motivational hot-air
balloon poster business,

09:04.172 --> 09:05.499
and of course,

09:05.500 --> 09:06.673
your complete lack of adult friends

09:06.674 --> 09:08.567
means you're well on
your way to a career

09:08.568 --> 09:10.499
as a pedophile birthday clown.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.499
But I love my job.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.566
William, you had a dream,

09:14.567 --> 09:15.575
and you achieved it.

09:15.576 --> 09:17.499
Now move on.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.570
Otherwise, you'll end up like that.

09:19.571 --> 09:21.567
Quietly smirking because you just did

09:21.568 --> 09:23.537
a little crop-dusting.

09:23.538 --> 09:25.592
Oh, and now you're enjoying the
sneaky tickle of your own stink

09:25.593 --> 09:28.532
as it ripples up your
enormous, soupy butt crack.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.519
Hey, why didn't you ask me
to be your running mate?

09:32.520 --> 09:33.558
I'm like the perfect candidate.

09:33.559 --> 09:35.499
Well, I didn't want it

09:35.500 --> 09:36.571
to ruin our friendship.

09:36.572 --> 09:38.516
I mean, look at Sarah Palin.

09:38.517 --> 09:39.965
She and her grandfather,
they were super close,

09:39.966 --> 09:41.558
and then he asked her
to be his running mate,

09:41.559 --> 09:44.549
and they lost, and now
they're not even speaking.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.517
But I do think you'd be
a great vice president,

09:46.518 --> 09:48.574
so I'm going to help you out.

09:48.575 --> 09:50.574
Come here.
Blaine Warbler?

09:50.575 --> 09:52.591
I'd like to introduce you
to Sam Evans.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.557
Um, we've actually met several times.

09:56.558 --> 09:58.517
He's your candidate
for vice president.

09:58.518 --> 10:00.517
Uh, no. I'm picking
my own running mate.

10:00.518 --> 10:02.557
My family's on food stamps,
so that will

10:02.558 --> 10:04.498
get you the sympathy vote.
I'm not gay,

10:04.499 --> 10:05.665
so that'll help
with the not-gay vote,

10:05.666 --> 10:07.536
and you know,
I don't want to brag, but...

10:07.537 --> 10:09.283
My impressions are hilarious

10:09.284 --> 10:10.504
100% of the time.

10:11.504 --> 10:12.517
It's George Bush, come on.

10:12.518 --> 10:13.570
Okay, sure.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.516
Awesome.

10:15.517 --> 10:16.538
First order of business,

10:16.539 --> 10:19.499
Artie and I challenge you
and Sam to a debate.

10:19.500 --> 10:20.570
You're on.

10:20.571 --> 10:22.575
What's a debate?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.521
I think it's time
we tackled something

10:27.522 --> 10:29.532
that we have been avoiding
for far too long,

10:29.533 --> 10:31.499
and I think you all know

10:31.500 --> 10:32.516
exactly

10:32.517 --> 10:33.558
what I'm talking about.

10:40.017 --> 10:42.007
Leather...

10:42.008 --> 10:45.007
Leather, but in unexpected ways.

10:45.008 --> 10:46.074
Pitch me.

10:46.075 --> 10:48.024
Okay, it's coming to me.

10:48.025 --> 10:50.082
It's coming to me. It's Italy.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.999
Saló, 1944.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.023
Belts as punishment.

10:53.024 --> 10:54.065
Belts as reward.

10:54.066 --> 10:56.025
"You can't have a belt!
put a belt on!"

10:56.026 --> 10:57.903
It's faux-fascist.

10:57.904 --> 10:59.048
It's... pair it with a chunky
boot.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.075
Okay, belts were two years ago,

11:00.076 --> 11:03.016
and chunky boots were five years ago.

11:03.017 --> 11:05.074
While we're on the topic
of the verboten,

11:05.075 --> 11:08.041
I would beg all of you
to please, please

11:08.042 --> 11:10.016
not offer up a leather platform.

11:10.017 --> 11:13.037
Chase, you know I love you,
and I... and I love

11:13.038 --> 11:15.041
that you're filled
with so much passion,

11:15.042 --> 11:17.036
so I'm definite...
I'm going to...

11:17.037 --> 11:19.017
I'll keep thinking
about it, of course.

11:19.018 --> 11:20.057
Okay.

11:20.058 --> 11:22.020
Um... Daphne.

11:22.021 --> 11:24.016
Leather socks.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.092
Suede underpants.

11:25.093 --> 11:28.074
Cowhide brassieres.

11:28.075 --> 11:30.058
Daphne, did you go
off your meds again?

11:30.059 --> 11:31.066
Yes.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.082
Then I want you to stay off

11:33.083 --> 11:35.766
because that... is sick.

11:36.067 --> 11:37.591
I mean good sick.
That's the...

11:37.592 --> 11:40.199
that's the kind of sick
I want you to be.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.081
You know, that's exactly what
I'm talking about, everybody.

11:42.082 --> 11:43.567
I don't want any rules...
just toss them.

11:43.568 --> 11:45.583
You know, let's think out of the box.

11:47.517 --> 11:48.590
Or... maybe... I don't know.

11:48.591 --> 11:50.583
Maybe that's... maybe that's
too far out of the box.

11:50.584 --> 11:52.516
Okay, why don't we do this?

11:52.517 --> 11:53.531
Let's, uh... we'll...

11:53.532 --> 11:54.783
we're going to take a...
a little break,

11:54.784 --> 11:56.582
and then we will...

11:56.583 --> 11:59.553
we'll revisit the topic
of leather, okay?

11:59.554 --> 12:01.592
Kurt, can I... can I see you
in my office?

12:04.504 --> 12:07.499
So, what did you think
of the ideas in there?

12:07.500 --> 12:08.592
Fascinating.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.520
I hated them.

12:12.521 --> 12:13.556
Look, I-I know I'm
just an intern,

12:13.557 --> 12:15.550
but I feel like "unexpected leather"

12:15.551 --> 12:18.499
should be in the back pages
of The Village Voice.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.541
No, I know, I agree, but Mand...

12:22.542 --> 12:24.021
Mandy, you know, the receptionist,

12:24.022 --> 12:26.507
every time I walk
by her, she suggests

12:26.508 --> 12:29.082
that I do an article on
trends in animal hide.

12:29.083 --> 12:32.499
And then her cat died.
Did you know her cat died?

12:32.500 --> 12:34.516
So, what, am I going to say no?

12:34.517 --> 12:37.500
- So now I'm stuck with leather.
- No, you're not.

12:37.501 --> 12:38.658
There are a million different ideas.

12:38.659 --> 12:41.541
Uh, we could do a music
video that pays tribute

12:41.542 --> 12:43.541
to the most cutting-edge
fashion, right?

12:43.542 --> 12:46.582
Well, I told Chase Madison
that I would do his piece

12:46.583 --> 12:50.524
on Spanx for cankles:
"Spankles."

12:50.525 --> 12:53.532
Oh, God. I'm an artist,
not a manager.

12:53.533 --> 12:56.503
I... I can't say no to anybody.
I can't bear it.

12:56.504 --> 12:58.503
You know, I'm...
I'm used to knocking on doors,

12:58.504 --> 12:59.538
not bolting them shut.

12:59.539 --> 13:03.499
Back in the day, if I had
an idea... a crazy idea...

13:03.500 --> 13:05.570
I knew if it was good
based on my instinct.

13:05.571 --> 13:09.532
And now crazy ideas
just seem crazy to me.

13:09.533 --> 13:13.553
You know, like, uh, uh...
uh, high-heeled galoshes or, um,

13:13.554 --> 13:15.553
equestrian underwear... what?

13:15.554 --> 13:20.549
And I can't...
I can't land anything.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.532
I just feel like I lucked

13:22.533 --> 13:25.516
into a job
that I don't deserve, and I...

13:25.517 --> 13:27.532
honestly, I-I-I...
I have no idea

13:27.533 --> 13:28.583
what I'm doing.

13:28.584 --> 13:30.516
My collection was a failure.

13:30.517 --> 13:31.523
I can't fail at this.

13:31.524 --> 13:33.406
And I just rented
a one-bedroom apartment

13:33.407 --> 13:34.573
in Midtown so I could walk to work.

13:34.574 --> 13:36.567
But now I'm not going to have
a job to walk to

13:36.568 --> 13:38.499
or an apartment to walk from.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.533
I'm going to be homeless.

13:39.534 --> 13:40.549
Hey, hey.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.507
You are not going to be homeless.

13:43.508 --> 13:45.516
All right? You can
always come stay

13:45.517 --> 13:47.508
with me and my roommate in Bushwick.

13:47.509 --> 13:49.532
Oh, God.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.507
Brittany, I just got a copy

13:51.508 --> 13:53.507
of Jacob Ben Israel's
latest presidential poll.

13:53.508 --> 13:55.591
The good news is 90%
of respondents said

13:55.592 --> 13:57.523
they're planning
on attending Friday's debate.

13:57.524 --> 13:59.506
That's cool.
So what's the bad news?

13:59.507 --> 14:01.542
90% of those respondents said
they were coming to hear you...

14:01.543 --> 14:05.553
say something
st... stu...

14:05.554 --> 14:07.517
They think I'm going to say
something stupid.

14:07.518 --> 14:09.532
But, see, you're not stupid.

14:09.533 --> 14:11.507
You're really creative.

14:11.508 --> 14:13.083
Your brain exists in this
magical other dimension

14:13.084 --> 14:14.532
where anything is possible.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.503
It's really amazing.

14:16.504 --> 14:18.553
We just need to focus on
a little preparation.

14:18.554 --> 14:20.519
If I'm going to be completely honest,

14:20.520 --> 14:21.788
I'm a little worried
that my picking you

14:21.789 --> 14:24.532
as a running mate is going to
seem like a desperate grab

14:24.533 --> 14:26.523
for the straight vote
if you don't really look

14:26.524 --> 14:28.498
like a serious candidate, you know?

14:28.499 --> 14:30.083
What do you mean, pilgrim?

14:30.084 --> 14:31.517
- Was that John Wayne?
- Yeah. I panicked.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.541
Okay, listen.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.499
When's your next free period?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.520
I need you to meet me
in the costume shop.

14:36.521 --> 14:38.582
Brittany S. Pierce,
how do you react

14:38.583 --> 14:41.503
to the characterization of
your first term in office

14:41.504 --> 14:44.499
as one in which you didn't do
anything at all until prom?

14:44.500 --> 14:46.549
I would describe that
as entirely accurate.

14:46.550 --> 14:48.499
Okay.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.721
Test scores at McKinley
have gone down

14:49.722 --> 14:51.524
six percent every year
for the past decade.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.517
- What would you do to fix the problem?
- Stop giving tests.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.988
They're hard, and there's
way too many of them.

14:54.989 --> 14:56.524
What is your favorite color?

14:56.525 --> 14:57.582
Filipino.

14:57.583 --> 14:59.520
They're very hard workers,

14:59.521 --> 15:01.524
and family is very important to them.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.675
You know what?

16:43.571 --> 16:45.532
First off, I'd just like to say

16:45.533 --> 16:47.532
what an honor it is
to have been asked to lead

16:47.533 --> 16:49.425
the annual
Show Choir Committee meeting.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.542
- Which of these snacks are gluten free?
- I guess the carrots are.

16:51.543 --> 16:52.573
Did it state so on the package?

16:52.574 --> 16:54.531
Because you do not want
to deal with me

16:54.532 --> 16:56.192
- if I've got gluten in my system.
- We really need

16:56.195 --> 16:57.583
- to get started, Mr. Rumba.
- What?

16:57.586 --> 16:59.554
- We really need to get started.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

16:59.557 --> 17:01.516
I did... several times.

17:01.517 --> 17:02.565
Well, I didn't hear you.

17:02.566 --> 17:04.521
You know I have complete
loss of hearing

17:04.521 --> 17:06.521
- in my left ear... scarlet fever.
- Uh, Birdie,

17:06.521 --> 17:07.738
You had mentioned you
wanted to discuss

17:07.739 --> 17:09.549
some of the redistricting bylaws.

17:09.550 --> 17:12.582
I've been doing some research,
and it turns out...

17:12.583 --> 17:14.523
- in Article 12...
- I'm so bored.

17:14.525 --> 17:15.588
What is wrong with me?

17:15.589 --> 17:17.523
This is what I've always wanted.

17:17.525 --> 17:18.589
I won Nationals.

17:18.590 --> 17:20.538
I'm... I'm in charge of this committee.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.507
But it feels so meaningless.

17:22.508 --> 17:23.771
Do all teachers feel this at some point?

17:23.771 --> 17:26.499
When Regionals occur
in a leap year...

17:26.500 --> 17:27.558
Oh, this is pointless!

17:27.559 --> 17:29.499
I didn't know how

17:29.500 --> 17:30.550
to tell you guys...

17:30.551 --> 17:33.525
- but my glee club lost its funding.
- Oh, my God.

17:33.526 --> 17:35.519
We're done. We can't even
complete the season.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.556
I know that everybody likes
to make fun of the deaf choir,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.567
but my kids have a song
in their heart; they're not

17:39.568 --> 17:41.899
going to be able to sing it.
For some of them,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.536
it's the only thing that brings
them any happiness.

17:43.537 --> 17:44.671
It's the only thing that brings me

17:44.672 --> 17:46.587
any happiness
besides my extreme couponing

17:46.588 --> 17:48.566
and muscle relaxers.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.499
I'm so sorry.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.738
- Is there anything we can do?
- Yeah.

17:51.741 --> 17:53.549
You can watch your back,
because you're next.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.524
We're all dead.

17:55.525 --> 17:57.524
The money for the arts has dried up.

17:57.525 --> 17:59.507
What we need is representation

17:59.508 --> 18:01.524
on that blue-ribbon
government panel to get arts

18:01.525 --> 18:02.542
back in the schools.

18:02.543 --> 18:03.958
There was a huge debate
over that in Congress.

18:03.961 --> 18:05.582
Oh, they don't care about us.

18:05.583 --> 18:07.548
They don't want
to have anything to do

18:07.549 --> 18:09.525
with show choir directors;
They want bigwigs

18:09.526 --> 18:11.532
like Meryl Streep or Demi Lovato.

18:11.533 --> 18:12.781
Maybe they'll take
a show choir director

18:12.782 --> 18:14.523
who just won Nationals
and wants to make

18:14.524 --> 18:15.558
a difference in this world.

18:15.559 --> 18:18.517
- Go for it.
- Highly unlikely.

18:18.518 --> 18:20.515
I'm going to have a shame Triscuit.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.575
I don't care if I have to spend

18:21.576 --> 18:23.537
all night on the potty.

18:23.538 --> 18:25.516
Yeah, I swear it.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.098
It was like a deleted
scene from The Exorcist

18:27.099 --> 18:28.583
that was cut because it
was actually too scary.

18:28.584 --> 18:30.567
- Oh, chilling.
- And then I tried...

18:30.570 --> 18:32.574
I tried to be, like,
nice and, you know, smile,

18:32.575 --> 18:34.525
but then the black swans said to me...

18:34.526 --> 18:36.553
I didn't know Lena Dunham
was joining us today.

18:36.554 --> 18:39.532
I'm sorry, but did I do
something to offend you?

18:39.533 --> 18:40.536
Your outfit did.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.515
It's at least a decade away from even

18:42.516 --> 18:43.567
being considered
for ironic-retro.

18:43.568 --> 18:45.499
It's a tragedy What Not to Wear

18:45.500 --> 18:46.558
doesn't do
two-hour specials.

18:48.517 --> 18:50.506
You know, part of why
I was so excited

18:50.507 --> 18:51.523
to come to New York was because

18:51.524 --> 18:52.588
I thought it would be a chance

18:52.589 --> 18:54.586
for me to start over,
reinvent myself.

18:54.587 --> 18:56.525
I had no idea that it was going to be

18:56.526 --> 18:58.507
so exactly the same.

18:58.508 --> 18:59.708
You know why you
feel exactly the same?

18:59.709 --> 19:00.508
Hmm?

19:00.509 --> 19:01.988
Because you're still
dressing exactly the same.

19:01.989 --> 19:04.532
We're not in Ohio any more, Rachel.

19:04.533 --> 19:06.582
And even then,
it's not like we were on trend.

19:06.583 --> 19:10.516
I hate to say this, but
life is like high school.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.516
Styles and clothes determine
the pecking order.

19:12.517 --> 19:14.553
Well, I don't know
what you expect me to do.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.540
It's not like I can afford
an entire new wardrobe.

19:16.541 --> 19:18.508
Who says you'll have to pay for it?

19:20.042 --> 19:22.033
Put down your chopsticks
and follow me.

19:22.034 --> 19:23.507
I got an idea.

19:23.508 --> 19:24.517
It's almost midnight.

19:24.518 --> 19:26.507
What are you talking about?

19:27.008 --> 19:29.066
I'm about to change your life.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.083
And maybe mine, too.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.524
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

19:37.525 --> 19:39.267
- Take a picture of me.
- Come on, quick, quick, quick.

19:39.568 --> 19:40.592
Check this out.

19:40.593 --> 19:42.582
This is unbelievable.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.517
Wait, I'm scared.
Don't leave me.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.938
Oh, my God.

19:53.550 --> 19:55.587
I can't even breathe.

19:55.588 --> 19:57.549
They call this the Couture Vault.

19:57.550 --> 19:59.587
It supposedly
can withstand a nuclear blast.

19:59.588 --> 20:01.570
Okay, I'll set up the camera.

20:01.571 --> 20:04.499
Freeze!

20:04.500 --> 20:05.529
Kurt.

20:05.530 --> 20:06.758
Oh, uh... I thought
you were going to be

20:06.759 --> 20:08.552
At dinner with Steve Buscemi
and Yoko Ono.

20:08.553 --> 20:09.565
Well, they canceled again.

20:09.566 --> 20:11.556
What are you doing here?
And who is that?

20:11.557 --> 20:13.098
I'm Rachel Berry...
I'm Kurt's roommate. He...

20:13.099 --> 20:14.750
We were going to do
a music video for the Web site.

20:14.751 --> 20:16.508
- He adores you.
- Rachel was going to get a makeover,

20:16.511 --> 20:18.566
And she was going to model
some clothes.

20:18.567 --> 20:20.516
Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

20:20.517 --> 20:21.567
You had me at "makeover."

- No, it's genius.

22:48.522 --> 22:49.583
And Rachel looks so gorgeous,

22:49.584 --> 22:52.566
the whole looks so...
like, professional,

22:52.567 --> 22:55.524
like a real fashion video that
you'd seen on TV or something.

22:55.525 --> 22:56.588
So what's the next step?

22:56.589 --> 22:58.582
Well, uh, ideally

22:58.583 --> 23:00.571
the dream would be that
Isabelle would see it,

23:00.572 --> 23:03.399
and love it, and then
put it on Vogue.com.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.569
But I mean, she's already committed
to so many other concepts that...

23:05.570 --> 23:07.848
No, Kurt, of course she's going to
choose yours. She's gonna pick yours.

23:07.849 --> 23:09.533
And then, after
we made over Rachel,

23:09.534 --> 23:12.399
Isabelle took us to this place
called Gray's Papaya

23:12.400 --> 23:13.592
and we had guava juice and hot dogs.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.554
- Wow.
- It was amazing.

23:15.557 --> 23:18.549
You're hanging out with fashion
goddess Isabelle Wright.

23:18.550 --> 23:19.883
And I'm running for
Student Body President

23:19.884 --> 23:21.549
with a former stripper.

23:21.550 --> 23:23.531
Oh my gosh, I forgot about that!
How's it going?

23:23.532 --> 23:24.588
It's going okay.

23:24.589 --> 23:26.591
But, um, I did want to
ask you what bow tie

23:26.592 --> 23:28.569
you thought I should wear
for tomorrow's debate.

23:28.570 --> 23:30.571
I have narrowed it down to five,
but mainly I have...

23:30.572 --> 23:32.132
Bow ties are your signature,

23:32.133 --> 23:33.588
whatever you choose is
gonna look great on you.

23:33.589 --> 23:35.533
- Hi, Blaine, we miss you!
- Oh, Rachel says hi.

23:35.534 --> 23:36.565
Oh, hi, Rachel.

23:36.566 --> 23:38.515
By the way, one more question
about the video.

23:38.516 --> 23:40.548
That scene where she plays
the East Village It Girl...

23:40.549 --> 23:41.588
did you think that was too much?

23:41.589 --> 23:43.587
No, it's... I don't know.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.554
Oh, good, good, good. 'Cause I
didn't either, but she was

23:45.555 --> 23:47.537
a little skeptical.

23:47.538 --> 23:49.154
But I said she was very
Chloe Sevigny chic, right?

23:49.155 --> 23:50.521
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:50.522 --> 23:52.558
And then, oh my God, I found
this sweater in the vault

23:52.559 --> 23:55.500
that was to die for!

23:59.500 --> 24:01.533
Hi.

24:01.536 --> 24:03.574
Hi.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.558
I know I don't have an
appointment, but, uh...

24:05.559 --> 24:08.507
I really needed to speak to
my guidance counselor,

24:08.508 --> 24:10.532
and not my fiancée.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.587
Well, please have
a seat, Mr. Schuester.

24:12.588 --> 24:14.532
Mr. Schuester.

24:14.533 --> 24:16.520
As you know,

24:16.521 --> 24:18.532
all I've ever wanted
was to make a difference.

24:18.533 --> 24:21.537
Change people's lives.
Make them better.

24:21.538 --> 24:23.275
I'd like to think that
I've done that in my time here.

24:23.276 --> 24:25.517
- Mm-hmm.
- Winning Nationals,

24:25.520 --> 24:27.549
Seeing most of the kids graduate.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.069
Right, you have a lot
to be proud of here.

24:30.591 --> 24:33.587
But now I have this once in a
lifetime opportunity in front of me.

24:33.588 --> 24:35.190
A chance to make a difference
on a whole new level.

24:35.191 --> 24:36.592
Okay.

24:36.595 --> 24:39.566
So they're... they're assembling
a blue-ribbon panel

24:39.567 --> 24:41.533
to improve arts education
around the country.

24:41.534 --> 24:43.532
I filled out the application,

24:43.533 --> 24:45.549
but I haven't sent it in yet.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.592
This looks amazing.

24:46.593 --> 24:48.566
If I were to get this...

24:48.567 --> 24:51.516
I would have to leave
McKinley for several months.

24:51.517 --> 24:52.571
Paid for by the District,

24:52.572 --> 24:56.570
but I'd be away from the kids.

24:56.571 --> 25:00.499
Oh. Um... Okay.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.537
I... You know we've been telling
these kids for years

25:03.538 --> 25:05.574
to follow their dreams
no matter what, so...

25:05.575 --> 25:07.532
Yeah.

25:07.533 --> 25:10.532
I'm not going to tell you
to do the opposite.

25:10.533 --> 25:13.582
I just don't want to do
anything to jeopardize...

25:13.583 --> 25:16.566
this-this new life
we're about to begin together.

25:16.567 --> 25:19.499
It's not gonna change a thing.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.553
Okay? Weddings can wait.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.582
You have to apply for this position.

25:24.583 --> 25:26.575
And if you get it,
we will cross that bridge

25:26.576 --> 25:28.516
when we come to it.

25:28.517 --> 25:29.550
Together.

25:41.550 --> 25:44.541
Attention, miniscule segment
of the student body.

25:44.542 --> 25:45.667
Principal Figgins is out this week,

25:45.668 --> 25:48.537
with what he describes as
religious fever.

25:48.538 --> 25:50.573
And I am forced
to moderate these proceedings.

25:50.574 --> 25:52.523
Hey, dude, uh,
now that you made me over,

25:52.524 --> 25:53.888
- can I give you some advice?
- Yeah, sure.

25:53.891 --> 25:55.575
- Lose the bow tie.
- What?

25:55.576 --> 25:57.531
Yeah, trust me,
it makes you look uptight

25:57.532 --> 25:58.988
and a little like a young
Orville Redenbacher.

25:58.989 --> 26:00.553
Just... take it off.

26:00.554 --> 26:02.532
Okay.

26:02.533 --> 26:03.553
You know what?

26:03.554 --> 26:05.587
Actually, it's...
you're actually right.

26:05.588 --> 26:07.069
Thank you.

26:07.070 --> 26:08.550
There are two new
utterly disheartening

26:08.553 --> 26:11.549
wrinkles to this year's
absolutely pointless contest.

26:11.550 --> 26:14.532
First, the horrifying fact that
this year's slate of candidates

26:14.533 --> 26:17.549
consists entirely
of Glee Club members.

26:17.550 --> 26:20.537
And secondly,
the inexplicable introduction

26:20.538 --> 26:21.552
of a vice presidential field

26:21.553 --> 26:23.540
for no discernable reason whatsoever.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.592
Separation of powers!

26:24.593 --> 26:26.570
Whoo!

26:26.571 --> 26:28.591
So let's meet these
second-tiered losers.

26:28.592 --> 26:30.575
You know them as
the pimp and the gimp.

26:30.576 --> 26:33.549
Artie Abrams and Sam Evans.

26:42.575 --> 26:45.549
Stumbles, my first
question is for you.

26:45.550 --> 26:47.548
Who, in God's name,
gives a hot, wet, steamy dump

26:47.549 --> 26:48.583
about student government?

26:48.584 --> 26:50.550
I do.

26:50.551 --> 26:52.525
And I think everyone
in this room should, too.

26:52.526 --> 26:55.582
First of all, student government
isn't just a way for us to pad

26:55.583 --> 26:58.203
our college résumés.
It's a way for us

26:58.204 --> 26:59.554
to take an active role
in our own education.

26:59.555 --> 27:01.516
Study after study shows

27:01.517 --> 27:02.533
that an active student body

27:02.534 --> 27:04.516
is a successful student body.

27:04.517 --> 27:05.540
Okay, moving on.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.398
Student government
is just the beginning.

27:07.399 --> 27:08.531
We need more
after-school programs,

27:08.532 --> 27:09.665
and better-qualified staff
to support

27:09.666 --> 27:11.533
our teachers, who are
overworked and underpaid.

27:11.534 --> 27:13.533
- Oh, dear God.
- And that's just the beginning.

27:13.536 --> 27:16.541
I want to talk about the
cafeteria, 'cause I believe...

27:16.542 --> 27:19.332
at the beginning of every
year to see if...

27:19.333 --> 27:20.573
enough to support
our brain activity...

27:20.574 --> 27:22.552
That's one of the many goals
I promise to reach

27:22.553 --> 27:24.538
by the midway point of my first term,

27:24.539 --> 27:25.903
as outlined in my 96-point

27:25.904 --> 27:27.583
Pierce-Abrams Road map
To Restore McKinley's Future.

27:27.584 --> 27:30.516
Merciful sweet Jesus, thank you.

27:30.517 --> 27:32.549
Sam Evans, your response?

27:32.550 --> 27:34.537
I wasn't really listening.

27:34.538 --> 27:36.537
Whatever Artie said,
I agree with that.

27:36.538 --> 27:38.582
Our next question
is from the Twitter.

27:38.583 --> 27:42.537
@HungrySouthMouth asks Sam Evans,

27:42.538 --> 27:44.533
"Rumor has it you were a
stripper. Aren't you ashamed?"

27:47.567 --> 27:49.533
No, I'm not.

27:52.551 --> 27:54.504
In fact...

27:56.583 --> 27:58.542
- Whoo...
- ♪ Shake that ♪

28:06.500 --> 28:08.550
Students at this school
have every right to be angry.

28:08.551 --> 28:11.520
Last year's student council,
led by my opponent,

28:11.521 --> 28:13.524
was the most ineffectual
in a generation.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.521
Brittany S. Pierce,
in her last term,

28:15.522 --> 28:17.520
accomplished absolutely nothing,

28:17.521 --> 28:18.583
except plan
a dinosaur-themed prom

28:18.584 --> 28:20.582
and ban the use

28:20.583 --> 28:22.508
of hair gel.

28:22.509 --> 28:23.592
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:23.593 --> 28:26.557
telling anyone what
they can or cannot

28:26.558 --> 28:29.549
put into their hair is disgusting.

28:29.550 --> 28:32.524
It's the first step
towards tyranny, my friends.

28:32.525 --> 28:34.567
Next thing you know,
they'll start burning books.

28:34.568 --> 28:37.557
And then they'll probably
start burning people, too.

28:37.558 --> 28:39.587
That's a lie.

28:39.588 --> 28:41.567
This tyranny all
ends today, McKinley.

28:41.568 --> 28:44.520
I want to offer you a change.

28:44.521 --> 28:45.583
And I am that change.

28:45.584 --> 28:48.499
Let's make history, Titans.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.520
And vote Anderson-Evans.

28:50.521 --> 28:51.533
Thank you.

28:53.533 --> 28:55.499
Sweet, simple Brittany.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.541
What say you?

28:56.542 --> 28:59.533
Uh...

29:00.542 --> 29:02.554
I love you.

29:04.517 --> 29:07.532
I love you so much,
McKinley High School.

29:07.533 --> 29:09.567
Simple as that.
In fact...

29:12.517 --> 29:13.533
I think that everyone

29:13.534 --> 29:16.532
should love this school
as much as I do.

29:16.533 --> 29:18.549
If you elect me as president,

29:18.550 --> 29:20.533
I promise to outlaw summer vacation,

29:20.534 --> 29:23.532
so we'll have school all year round.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.507
That means we'll spend every day

29:25.508 --> 29:29.516
of every summer indoors
with all our friends,

29:29.517 --> 29:31.571
in McKinley High School's
award-winning air conditioning.

29:31.572 --> 29:34.541
Also, I promise to end

29:34.542 --> 29:36.588
McKinley High School's
policy of having weekends.

29:36.589 --> 29:39.532
If you make me your president,

29:39.533 --> 29:41.508
Saturday and Sunday will be illegal,

29:41.509 --> 29:43.549
so that Monday will
come right after Friday,

29:43.550 --> 29:45.532
which is the funnest day anyways.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.571
Vote Brittany and Artie.
Thank you so much.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.533
We just lost the election.

29:56.500 --> 29:57.583
Kurt, can I see you for a minute?

29:59.567 --> 30:01.571
You might want to sit down for this.

30:04.567 --> 30:06.566
I saw your video,

30:06.567 --> 30:08.557
and I forwarded it to Anna.

30:08.558 --> 30:11.550
Am I fired?

30:16.571 --> 30:18.574
That is the first time

30:18.575 --> 30:20.498
that I've heard "great" from Anna.

30:20.499 --> 30:21.654
I am gonna print that and frame it.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.116
Does... does this mean

30:23.117 --> 30:24.525
they're gonna put the
video on the Web site?

30:24.526 --> 30:25.533
Sort of.

30:25.534 --> 30:26.806
We're gonna reshoot the whole thing

30:26.807 --> 30:28.575
in Bali with Karolína Kurková,
but you're getting credit

30:28.576 --> 30:30.550
- for the idea.
- Oh, my...

30:30.553 --> 30:33.499
Oh, thank you, thank you so much.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.013
Thank you.

30:34.014 --> 30:35.625
And thank you so much for
helping out with Rachel.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.552
She went home that night

30:36.553 --> 30:37.754
and threw away her reindeer sweater,

30:37.755 --> 30:39.557
which is a huge deal for her.

30:39.558 --> 30:41.571
Ah, she already seems so much
more confident, you know?

30:41.572 --> 30:43.587
It's so funny how

30:43.588 --> 30:45.583
a new image can change everything.

30:46.084 --> 30:47.087
Oh...

30:47.088 --> 30:50.032
I sure hope you never lose that.

30:50.033 --> 30:51.087
What?

30:51.088 --> 30:53.049
Oh, just your...

30:53.050 --> 30:57.024
unbridled, wide-eyed,
Lima, Ohio optimism.

30:57.025 --> 30:59.088
You know, I had an instinct
about you, Kurt Hummel,

30:59.089 --> 31:02.049
and so far,
it's proven to be correct.

31:02.050 --> 31:04.088
I feel like we're real
kindred spirits, don't you?

31:04.089 --> 31:05.999
I agree.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.049
Can I please just say that

31:08.050 --> 31:10.074
I think you're the best-dressed
fairy godmother

31:10.075 --> 31:13.053
an intern like me could ever have?

31:13.054 --> 31:15.015
Well, then, can your fairy godmother

31:15.016 --> 31:16.075
give you a little bit of advice?

31:16.076 --> 31:19.082
You have quite the
aptitude for fashion.

31:19.083 --> 31:22.032
And I know it's your
dream to go to NYADA,

31:22.033 --> 31:24.016
but sometimes dreams can change,

31:24.017 --> 31:26.057
and I really would not
be surprised if someday,

31:26.058 --> 31:28.003
every A-lister in this town

31:28.004 --> 31:30.000
was fighting for one of your designs.

31:31.038 --> 31:33.021
So which "leather" pitch
are we running with?

31:33.022 --> 31:34.999
Oh, actually, you know what?

31:35.000 --> 31:37.065
We're gonna toss the whole thing
and start from scratch.

31:37.066 --> 31:39.000
We're gonna meet here in two hours.

31:39.001 --> 31:42.053
Oh, and, um...
Kurt will be joining us.

31:42.054 --> 31:44.088
I'm famished.
Let's go to Indochine.

31:50.054 --> 31:52.074
Wow.

31:52.075 --> 31:53.082
Hm.

31:53.083 --> 31:56.999
You look incredible.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.016
They say that you haven't
settled into New York City

32:00.017 --> 32:02.082
until you've had your first makeover.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.032
Mine took six months.

32:04.033 --> 32:06.017
Oh, really?
Like you need a makeover?

32:06.018 --> 32:08.032
Every girl in school
wants to date you.

32:08.033 --> 32:10.083
True.

32:10.086 --> 32:12.066
But four years ago,

32:12.067 --> 32:14.082
I was a scrawny kid
from backwater Montana,

32:14.083 --> 32:17.024
with a bad haircut and a unibrow.

32:17.025 --> 32:18.186
And seniors took me under their wing,

32:18.187 --> 32:20.071
introduced me to waxes and the gym,

32:20.072 --> 32:22.067
- and they changed my life.
- Yeah.

32:22.068 --> 32:24.067
It's pretty amazing what
a good makeover can do.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.066
It's like you change the outside,

32:26.067 --> 32:29.016
and then the inside
just... follows.

32:29.017 --> 32:31.070
I think it's the other way around.

32:31.071 --> 32:34.082
I think now your outside

32:34.083 --> 32:36.050
has caught up to how
you feel about yourself.

32:36.051 --> 32:38.082
Hmm.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.066
I like that.

32:40.067 --> 32:43.033
I like you.

32:48.050 --> 32:49.083
So what are you working on?

32:49.084 --> 32:51.032
Just a new number.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.071
I like to do something every day,

32:52.072 --> 32:54.071
just to keep
my machine well-oiled.

32:54.072 --> 32:57.066
Oh, me too.

32:57.067 --> 32:59.083
I love that song.

33:00.092 --> 33:02.999
Do you, uh...

33:03.000 --> 33:05.020
want to sing it with me?

What are you doing tomorrow tonight?

35:35.083 --> 35:36.554
I want to cook you dinner.

35:43.025 --> 35:45.049
Attention, students:

35:45.050 --> 35:49.070
Your record-low election votes
have been tallied,

35:49.071 --> 35:51.024
and we have a winner.

35:51.025 --> 35:53.088
Becky, can I get
a xylophone flourish?

35:58.008 --> 36:01.024
No? Not feeling it?

36:01.025 --> 36:03.037
Okay.

36:03.538 --> 36:08.021
This year's Student Council
President is...

36:18.075 --> 36:19.071
How do you do?

36:19.072 --> 36:20.088
How you doing?

36:22.050 --> 36:24.050
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you, Artie.

36:24.051 --> 36:26.048
Losing the bow tie, that was
your game changer... kudos.

36:26.049 --> 36:27.081
No hard feelings.

36:27.082 --> 36:29.033
Maybe I can find a place
for you in my administration.

36:29.034 --> 36:31.082
No, thanks;
I got what I needed.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.037
Sugar asked me out on a date.

36:33.038 --> 36:35.007
She invited me horseback riding.

36:35.008 --> 36:37.499
I'm just hoping it doesn't
involve being towed.

36:37.500 --> 36:39.538
- You talk to Kurt?
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

36:39.541 --> 36:42.566
He was super proud of me
and he's really excited.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.499
He's already planning
a whole inaugural ball.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.516
Well, congratulations.

36:47.517 --> 36:49.000
Thanks.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.086
You know,
I have not stepped foot inside

36:52.087 --> 36:54.071
a Manhattan movie theater
since the bedbug scare.

36:54.072 --> 36:57.004
And this is a fact:

36:57.007 --> 36:59.016
They prefer to lay
their eggs in couture.

37:00.038 --> 37:01.092
That's true.
Who wouldn't?

37:03.025 --> 37:04.999
I'm not lying.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.503
What's the
last movie you saw?

37:06.504 --> 37:07.583
The last...
Ooh, you know what?

37:07.584 --> 37:10.524
The last movie I saw was
a double feature.

37:10.525 --> 37:12.507
It was, um, Unmarried Woman

37:12.508 --> 37:14.507
and The Red Balloon.

37:14.508 --> 37:15.531
You weren't bored.

37:15.532 --> 37:16.588
No, no, I wasn't even...

37:16.589 --> 37:18.508
That's okay.

37:19.533 --> 37:21.499
There's the man of the hour.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.507
You all right?

37:24.508 --> 37:26.557
You know, it didn't hit me
until right now:

37:26.558 --> 37:29.516
I came to McKinley
for Kurt... that's it.

37:30.517 --> 37:33.591
And now he's gone, and even
with Glee Club, it just...

37:34.092 --> 37:37.082
I feel really,
really... alone.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.033
You're kind of killing
my party buzz, bro.

37:39.034 --> 37:41.032
I'm sorry, it's just that

37:41.033 --> 37:43.016
I did all of this for him,
I did all of this for him.

37:43.017 --> 37:44.050
And now he's not here.

37:44.051 --> 37:47.016
And so it just kind of feels
like none of it matters.

37:47.017 --> 37:48.071
Of course it matters.

37:48.072 --> 37:51.037
You're McKinley's
"First Gay Guy President."

37:51.038 --> 37:52.065
Nobody cares about that.

37:52.066 --> 37:54.088
Look, before you, Kurt was
the first gay kid I met.

37:54.089 --> 37:56.037
Don't get me wrong, he's great,

37:56.038 --> 37:58.017
but I just don't really
get his Bravo jokes

37:58.018 --> 38:01.049
or the fashion thing or Broadway.

38:01.050 --> 38:03.004
You and me, it's different, you know?

38:03.005 --> 38:06.016
I never had a gaybro before.
We'd be like

38:06.017 --> 38:07.054
Wolverine and Cyclops, you know,

38:07.055 --> 38:10.032
show people how we're
cool with each other.

38:10.033 --> 38:12.050
And you know, if you ask me,
that's what matters.

38:12.051 --> 38:14.016
Thanks, man.

38:14.017 --> 38:15.053
You're right.

38:15.054 --> 38:19.032
But just so we're clear...

38:19.033 --> 38:20.033
I'm Wolverine.

38:20.034 --> 38:21.053
I'm...

38:21.054 --> 38:22.524
I said it first.

38:22.525 --> 38:24.083
Congratulations, Blaine Warbler.

38:24.084 --> 38:25.999
Thank you, Brit.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.566
Cool.

38:27.567 --> 38:31.549
Congratulations to you,
Mr. Vice President.

38:31.550 --> 38:33.499
The people have spoken.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.499
Can I let you in on a little secret?

38:35.500 --> 38:36.550
I like secrets.

38:37.551 --> 38:39.587
I voted for you.

38:39.588 --> 38:40.550
What?

38:46.567 --> 38:47.916
Thank you.

38:48.517 --> 38:49.532
I would've voted for you, too,

38:49.533 --> 38:51.537
but I-I just
really wanted to win.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.502
I know losing sucks, but you know,

38:53.503 --> 38:54.575
sometimes it can be a good thing.

38:54.576 --> 38:56.503
Look at Al Gore.

38:56.504 --> 38:58.516
He lost an election,
then he won an Oscar.

38:58.517 --> 38:59.538
He did?

39:01.504 --> 39:02.504
You think so?

39:05.500 --> 39:07.532
I don't know how you do it.

39:07.533 --> 39:09.507
What?

39:10.008 --> 39:12.503
You just always know exactly
the right thing to say.

39:12.504 --> 39:13.587
It's a gift.

39:18.204 --> 39:19.499
You win.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.690
I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

39:20.691 --> 39:22.575
but I'm taking Sue
Sylvester's advice.

39:23.276 --> 39:25.524
I mailed in the application.

39:25.525 --> 39:26.540
Congratulations, William.

39:26.541 --> 39:27.586
I think it's the right decision.

39:27.587 --> 39:29.590
Yeah.
There's only one problem.

39:29.591 --> 39:31.583
I need a written recommendation
from a colleague,

39:31.584 --> 39:32.516
and I was thinking...

39:32.517 --> 39:34.566
I'm one step ahead
of you, butt-chin.

39:34.567 --> 39:36.542
I took the liberty of
composing a letter

39:36.543 --> 39:39.541
to the Arts Governing Board outlining

39:39.542 --> 39:41.587
your astonishing accomplishments.

39:41.588 --> 39:45.541
"Not only is William a direct
descendant of Harriet Tubman,

39:45.542 --> 39:48.499
he delivered my infant child
with his bare hands"?

39:48.500 --> 39:50.520
Sue, Sue, this isn't even true.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.542
Well, what can I say, William?
I want you out of here.

39:52.543 --> 39:55.521
And for the first time, I think
I mean that in a good way.

40:11.517 --> 40:12.566
Oh, my God...

40:12.567 --> 40:15.517
Oh! Oh! Oh!

40:17.504 --> 40:18.541
Oh...

40:25.250 --> 40:26.275
Wow.

40:27.200 --> 40:28.533
You're smokin'.

40:28.534 --> 40:30.524
Oh, it's actually the duck.

40:30.525 --> 40:31.566
No, no.

40:31.567 --> 40:34.499
It's, it's you.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.591
Come in.

40:36.092 --> 40:38.507
I really wanted to cook you dinner,

40:38.508 --> 40:39.588
but this is what you get.

40:39.589 --> 40:42.508
- This is, this is good.
- Pizza.

40:42.511 --> 40:45.503
Food is food. It's, it's
the effort that counts.

40:45.504 --> 40:48.566
A girl has never cooked
me dinner before.

40:48.567 --> 40:49.503
I don't believe you.

40:49.504 --> 40:51.517
No.

40:51.518 --> 40:52.531
No one has ever even tried.

40:52.532 --> 40:53.971
I'm trying new things.

40:53.972 --> 40:56.520
Doing new things, it's all part of

40:56.521 --> 40:57.975
you know, the new me.

40:57.976 --> 40:59.516
And I like it.

40:59.517 --> 41:01.570
I like, I like the new me.

41:01.571 --> 41:04.507
I've never been the
cook-a-guy-dinner type.

41:04.508 --> 41:06.582
I've always been the just
annoy-a-guy-for-a-year

41:06.583 --> 41:08.541
until-he-finally-
gives-in type.

41:08.542 --> 41:11.503
Well, tell, tell me
about this old Rachel.

41:11.504 --> 41:13.583
- Tell me a secret.
- A secret?

41:13.586 --> 41:16.499
Something that you don't want
anyone else to know.

41:16.500 --> 41:19.499
Okay, but you first.

41:19.500 --> 41:22.508
- Okay.
- Think of something very good.

41:22.511 --> 41:24.583
- Okay, so, um, when I was a kid...
- Mm-hmm.

41:24.586 --> 41:27.500
- I was obsessed with Ace of Base.
- No.

41:27.503 --> 41:28.558
Yes.

41:28.559 --> 41:30.542
I was... seriously, I had
the posters on my wall.

41:30.543 --> 41:32.582
Wait. I thought you said
you were straight.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.571
Oh, come on.

41:34.574 --> 41:38.570
Hot girls playing all
their own instruments...

41:38.571 --> 41:40.499

41:45.521 --> 41:47.532
My turn, okay.

41:47.533 --> 41:50.499
Um, I have a good one.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.583
When I was eight years old,
I got my first love letter

41:52.584 --> 41:55.542
from a guy named Tony.

41:55.545 --> 41:57.516
And he was very cute.

41:57.517 --> 41:59.532
And when he gave it to me,

41:59.533 --> 42:01.500
I corrected all
of the grammatical errors

42:01.501 --> 42:03.500
and his spelling errors
and gave it back to him.

42:04.533 --> 42:05.583
That's so embarrassing.

42:05.584 --> 42:07.583
I've never told anybody that before,

42:07.584 --> 42:10.566
not even Finn.

42:12.567 --> 42:13.982
Well, just so you know,

42:13.983 --> 42:16.507
no matter how lovely this is,

42:16.508 --> 42:19.507
