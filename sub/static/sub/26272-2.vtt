00:10.575 --> 00:13.100
[car horns honking in distance]

00:13.143 --> 00:15.189
[bell jingles]

00:15.232 --> 00:18.409
Richard. Richard Briggs.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.370
This is for Ella.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.894
[people screaming, dog barking]

00:27.679 --> 00:29.464
[panting]

00:30.247 --> 00:32.249
[sirens wailing]

00:34.904 --> 00:36.384
CHUNK:
Fruit again?

00:36.427 --> 00:37.602
You know,

00:37.646 --> 00:39.430
those come from trees.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.258
Trees live in dirt.

00:41.302 --> 00:44.131
You want to give the boss food
that comes from dirt, go ahead.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.002
But honestly, I think at this
point, the man would appreciate

00:46.046 --> 00:47.569
coffee and a doughnut.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.005
Not funny.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.963
I know I would appreciate
coffee and a doughnut.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.096
I mean, look at this stuff.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.706
Quinoa porridge?

00:54.750 --> 00:57.361
Look, I'm all for healthy,
but this stuff will kill you.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.668
You got any food around here
for real people?

00:59.711 --> 01:02.671
Top drawer on your left,
behind the paper towels.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.325
Don't tell anyone.

01:04.368 --> 01:05.674
Don't tell anyone what?

01:05.717 --> 01:09.112
Hallelujah. Mmm.

01:15.292 --> 01:17.468
[sighs]

01:20.384 --> 01:22.778
Damn, I miss her.

01:22.821 --> 01:28.044
Her mom keeps promising to come
by and pick up her things.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.307
I'll make sure
and add that to the box.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.311
Anybody hear about that guy who
was gunned down on the sidewalk

01:34.355 --> 01:37.140
in the middle of the day
during a beer run yesterday?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.141
That poor woman.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.708
That poor man.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.971
It happened right around
the corner from where I live.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.582
She just walked up to him,
shot him, point blank range.

01:44.626 --> 01:46.758
Well, no. She didn't just.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.586
The guy raped and killed
her daughter.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
And believe me, if something
like that ever happens

01:50.545 --> 01:53.548
to my child, I'm gonna want
to do the exact same thing.

01:53.591 --> 01:56.507
Well, wanting is fine.
Doing is a whole other thing.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.509
There are laws in this country.

01:58.553 --> 02:00.381
Yeah, well, obviously
the law didn't work

02:00.424 --> 02:02.513
for the woman
who lost her daughter.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.298
I mean, she was just doing
what the jury refused to do.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.996
Oh, you can't blame the jury.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.346
They were never given the
evidence they needed to convict.

02:09.390 --> 02:11.218
How is that even possible?

02:11.261 --> 02:12.958
I mean, they found
the girl's body

02:13.002 --> 02:14.308
in the trunk
of this guy's car.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.613
What more do you need?

02:15.657 --> 02:17.615
Problem is, the jury
never heard any of that.

02:17.659 --> 02:20.444
Turns out, the police had

02:20.488 --> 02:23.099
a description
of the kidnapper's car.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.276
Now, this Richard Briggs was
driving a car that matched,

02:26.320 --> 02:28.626
so the police pulled him over
and they searched it.

02:28.670 --> 02:32.152
Now, if there were a body
laying in the back seat,

02:32.195 --> 02:33.544
wouldn't have been a problem.

02:33.588 --> 02:34.719
But it was in the trunk.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.505
And you're not allowed
to open the trunk

02:37.548 --> 02:39.376
without probable cause.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.292
At that point
the police didn't have it.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.554
BULL:
Marissa!

02:45.034 --> 02:47.384
You barked, sir?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.647
How long has this piece of mail
been sitting on my desk?

02:49.691 --> 02:52.172
Your jury summons? Since April.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.522
Oh. Really? Six months.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.480
That postmark in the upper
right-hand corner?

02:56.524 --> 02:57.699
That is a dead giveaway.

02:57.742 --> 02:59.570
Well, make a call
and get me out of it.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.703
You know I can't do that.
We've already postponed it once,

03:01.746 --> 03:03.313
and that's all you're allowed.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.228
When are you due to report?

03:05.272 --> 03:06.795
Day after tomorrow.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.231
Damn it, what a waste of time.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
I spend half a day waiting
to be interviewed,

03:09.928 --> 03:11.626
and then the attorneys
figure out who I am,

03:11.669 --> 03:13.541
and they can't
get rid of me fast enough.

03:13.584 --> 03:14.846
It's not easy being you.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.631
And another thing:
my phone is not working.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.067
It hasn't rung in days.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.199
The phones are fine.
They're not ringing

03:19.242 --> 03:20.243
because no one's calling.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.462
What do you mean?

03:21.505 --> 03:24.291
You haven't been here
for three months.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.249
I mean, let's be honest.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.946
You're the reason people call.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.383
And they called plenty
while you were away,

03:29.426 --> 03:31.036
but after a while,
people get tired of hearing,

03:31.080 --> 03:33.038
"He's not here and we're
not certain when he'll be back."

03:33.082 --> 03:34.301
Hmm.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.259
Well, I guess
we need to make some noise.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.652
Let people know
we're back up to speed.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.088
Call over to the D.A.'s office.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.438
See if there's any juicy
pro bono opportunities

03:41.482 --> 03:42.874
we can avail
ourselves of.

03:42.918 --> 03:45.094
Something that will
get us some clicks,

03:45.137 --> 03:46.835
some ink, some TV time.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.011
Clicks, ink, and TV time.

03:49.054 --> 03:50.273
I love it
when your better angels make

03:50.317 --> 03:52.144
an unscheduled cameo appearance.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.887
You know what?

03:57.062 --> 04:00.283
I think I might actually
have something for you.

04:00.327 --> 04:04.374
He'd come over every Wednesday.

04:04.418 --> 04:07.508
Always commenting
on how they looked.

04:07.551 --> 04:10.946
Their clothes,
their hair, how...

04:10.989 --> 04:14.950
how beautiful they were.

04:14.993 --> 04:17.866
He was your daughter's
piano teacher.

04:17.909 --> 04:21.522
I always thought it was
about the 15-year-old.

04:23.350 --> 04:28.746
When I... think about
the things he did

04:28.790 --> 04:31.662
to my little one.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.664
To Ella.

04:33.708 --> 04:37.451
And then,
suddenly he was free.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.540
It was like
it never happened.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.019
I'd lost my 11-year-old,

04:41.063 --> 04:44.240
and he was driving around town
like it was a holiday.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.243
Like he'd gotten away
with murder.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.811
Which he had.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.640
So I went and bought a gun.

04:52.683 --> 04:55.251
Something I thought
I'd never do.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.036
Easiest thing in the world.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.431
And then I just waited for him.

05:01.475 --> 05:04.652
So you shot him three times
in the chest in broad daylight

05:04.695 --> 05:07.045
in front of a dozen witnesses.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.439
And didn't even try to flee.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.702
You must have known you weren't
gonna get away with it.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.661
I didn't care.

05:13.704 --> 05:17.317
I wasn't thinking
about any of that.

05:19.493 --> 05:24.149
I just needed to know
he was no longer among us.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.719
â™ª

05:39.469 --> 05:40.557
[excited chatter]

05:40.601 --> 05:42.559
Just keep your head down
and ignore them.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.474
So what happens today?

05:44.518 --> 05:47.042
A number of things, but first
off, there's a question of bail.

05:47.085 --> 05:49.305
Oh, my gosh, you think they'll
actually offer me bail?

05:49.349 --> 05:52.134
No, but we have to go through
the formality of asking.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.092
And then the other side gets to
indulge in the sadistic pleasure

05:54.136 --> 05:56.094
of telling the court what
a dangerous person you are.

05:56.138 --> 05:57.792
It's just part of the fun.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.228
[quietly]:
Look at me, Mrs. Spiro.

05:59.271 --> 06:02.231
We're gonna get you
through this,

06:02.274 --> 06:04.059
and then we're gonna
get you out of here.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.453
You just have to trust me.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.280
Earth to Marissa.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.108
Benny and I and our client
are making our way

06:10.152 --> 06:11.153
into the courtroom.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.068
Bull, what are you
talking about?

06:13.111 --> 06:15.070
You have jury duty this morning.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.072
[sighs]

06:17.115 --> 06:18.639
You're gonna need this.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.857
You all right?

06:19.901 --> 06:21.206
No, I think I may
have screwed up.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.078
I have a bit of business
I need to take care of.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.471
Mrs. Spiro,

06:24.514 --> 06:25.907
I have to run upstairs
to another courtroom

06:25.950 --> 06:27.169
for a couple of hours.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.736
A couple of hours?It's not a problem.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.564
Nothing of any consequence
ever happens here before lunch,

06:30.607 --> 06:31.739
and even if it did,

06:31.782 --> 06:33.175
you couldn't be in better hands.

06:33.218 --> 06:34.655
You got it.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.178
Mrs. Spiro?

06:36.221 --> 06:37.179
Bull?

06:37.222 --> 06:38.310
How late am I?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.964
20 minutes.

06:40.008 --> 06:42.184
How long do you think
it'll take me to get excused?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.404
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.407
I'm betting 45 minutes.

06:50.235 --> 06:52.977
A.A.G. LANFORD:
The defendant,

06:53.021 --> 06:58.418
one Kendrick Gorman,
who is accused

06:58.461 --> 07:00.724
of practicing law

07:00.768 --> 07:04.467
without a license.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.251
BULL: My God, he's actually
pronouncing every comma.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.297
That's right.

07:08.340 --> 07:12.214
Could there possibly be
a bigger abuse of trust?

07:13.476 --> 07:17.045
You find yourself
on the wrong side of the law.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.699
Desperate for help.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.570
You hire an attorney.

07:20.614 --> 07:24.356
Only to find that he's not
really an attorney.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.536
But an impostor.

07:29.579 --> 07:32.060
BULL: As opposed to an authentic idiot like you.

07:32.103 --> 07:35.237
Dr. Jason Bull.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.196
TheDr. Jason Bull?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.981
Hmm. I'm afraid so.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.113
What a pleasure
to finally meet you.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.028
And you, as well.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.770
And now, I know you've done work
with my office,

07:46.814 --> 07:50.165
the state attorney
general's office, and I know

07:50.208 --> 07:53.037
you're also thought to be
one of the best in your field.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.475
So, just to be clear,
you advise

07:55.518 --> 07:59.000
people like me
how to pick juries.

07:59.043 --> 08:03.004
What to say to juries,
how to get the juries to come

08:03.047 --> 08:06.703
to conclusions whoever hires you
needs them to come to.

08:06.747 --> 08:07.965
Is that correct?

08:08.009 --> 08:10.490
Well, that's not
how I'd put it, but...

08:10.533 --> 08:13.188
Your Honor, we'd like
to strike this juror for cause.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.624
What cause?

08:14.668 --> 08:16.365
Well, you just heard him.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.367
He is an expert

08:18.410 --> 08:20.543
in all matters
pertaining to juries.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.153
HUDSON:
And that's all well and good.

08:22.197 --> 08:25.548
But as far as I can tell,
in this particular case,

08:25.592 --> 08:28.682
Dr. Bull will not
be picking jurors.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.336
Nor will he be advising either
side on what to say to them.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.209
And as far as helping them
come to conclusions,

08:34.252 --> 08:35.558
well, hopefully that's the job

08:35.602 --> 08:39.344
of every juror during
the period of deliberations.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.130
Ms. Dunn, would you care
to question the juror?

08:44.567 --> 08:47.178
So you're a jury consultant?

08:47.222 --> 08:49.180
A trial scientist, yes.

08:49.224 --> 08:52.270
You advise lawyers
on how to try their cases.

08:52.314 --> 08:54.708
Sometimes, yes.

08:54.751 --> 08:58.712
So, in a sense, you practice law
without a license.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.235
Just like my client.

09:00.278 --> 09:02.411
No, I wouldn't exactly say that.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.892
This juror
is acceptable to the defense.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.808
Your Honor, uh, if I may,

09:07.851 --> 09:10.332
I would love
to be seated on this jury.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.769
Well, then, today's
your lucky day.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.423
But unfortunately, um,

09:14.466 --> 09:17.948
I have a-a previous commitment,
a legal commitment.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.471
A legal commitment?

09:19.515 --> 09:22.387
Yes, indeed. Uh, I am
in the midst of starting

09:22.431 --> 09:25.869
a murder trial downstairs,
right in this very courthouse.

09:25.913 --> 09:29.264
And, um... uh,
you may have heard of it.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.658
The State v. Heather Spiro?

09:31.701 --> 09:34.138
It's a very big, important case.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.097
Yes, I have heard of it.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.925
Well, aren't you the VIP?

09:37.968 --> 09:39.013
[chuckles]

09:39.056 --> 09:40.841
However, trial scientists
are not now,

09:40.884 --> 09:42.930
nor have they ever been,
essential

09:42.973 --> 09:45.454
to the American
criminal justice system.

09:45.497 --> 09:47.630
But jurors are.

09:47.674 --> 09:50.198
Your Honor, my client
is facing a life sentence.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.373
She has a lawyer?

09:51.416 --> 09:53.636
She does.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.770
Good. Then everybody has
what they need.

09:56.813 --> 09:59.337
She has a lawyer,
we have 12 jurors.

09:59.381 --> 10:02.123
Welcome to my court, Dr. Bull.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.952
And welcome to jury duty.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.701
Ah. You can win
$100 million verdicts

10:14.744 --> 10:16.528
against multinational
corporations,

10:16.572 --> 10:18.792
but you can't argue
your way out of jury duty?

10:18.835 --> 10:20.402
Trust me, I tried.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.056
I think the judge
has a crush on me.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.013
Needless to say,

10:23.057 --> 10:24.972
our client is not pleased.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.016
Oh, I don't blame her.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.801
You just missed her.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.020
They just put her in
the prison van ten minutes ago.

10:30.064 --> 10:33.763
Well, the good news is, I won't
be on this jury for long.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.809
There are only three people
on the witness list.

10:35.852 --> 10:37.811
Whole thing should
be over in a day.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.900
Now, I was thinking
for tomorrow,

10:39.943 --> 10:42.076
it makes sense to promote Chunk
to the second chair.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.078
Someone sitting next to you
with Marissa in his ear.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.907
I get that.
So what's the strategy?

10:46.950 --> 10:48.909
Well, I'm thinking
EED defense.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.127
EED?

10:51.868 --> 10:53.783
Extreme emotional disturbance?

10:53.827 --> 10:56.177
No, that's not going to work.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.048
EED happens in the moment.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.746
And the evidence clearly proves

10:59.789 --> 11:01.617
that this was not
a spontaneous act.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.923
By her own admission,

11:02.966 --> 11:05.882
she was lying in wait
for this guy for days.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.624
I know. I just want to use it
to get our foot in the door.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.800
Gives us an excuse
in your opening statement

11:10.844 --> 11:12.410
to talk about
the horrific details

11:12.454 --> 11:13.934
of what happened
to this woman's child,

11:13.977 --> 11:14.978
which otherwise...

11:15.022 --> 11:16.197
We're going to get caught.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.374
And when that happens,
we will apologize

11:19.417 --> 11:21.724
and come up with
a different attack.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.899
But I'll be in the
courtroom by then

11:22.943 --> 11:24.945
and we'll figure
something out.

11:24.988 --> 11:28.775
Also, have Danny get a line
on the surviving daughter.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.342
We need to give the jury
as many reasons as possible

11:31.386 --> 11:34.215
to not send Heather to prison,
and what better reason

11:34.258 --> 11:37.479
than she has a teenage
daughter who needs her

11:37.522 --> 11:39.524
and is waiting for
her to come home?

11:46.662 --> 11:49.186
DANNY:
The tattoo new?

11:50.187 --> 11:52.189
Looks new.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.887
I did it myself.

11:53.930 --> 11:57.151
What about
the piercings?

11:57.194 --> 11:59.501
Last weekend.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.156
There's not a lot
to do around here,

12:02.199 --> 12:04.636
and I don't really
know anybody.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.682
I mean, I know
my aunt, but...

12:06.726 --> 12:07.814
Would you like your mom
to see them?

12:07.857 --> 12:08.815
I can take a picture for you.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.817
No.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.819
She's got enough
going on right now.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.821
She doesn't need
to worry about me.

12:14.864 --> 12:19.042
Well, she is...
worried about you.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.783
She wants
to come home to you,

12:20.827 --> 12:21.958
take care of you.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.612
Mm-hmm.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.746
Well, the reason I'm here, uh,

12:26.789 --> 12:28.965
we'd like for you
to come to the city,

12:29.009 --> 12:30.706
be a part of the trial.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.491
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

12:33.535 --> 12:37.060
Well, I can come here.
I can, I can pick you up.

12:37.104 --> 12:38.758
Can sit with you in court.

12:41.804 --> 12:45.242
The jury needs to see
that your mom still has a child,

12:45.286 --> 12:49.203
a child who loves her,
misses her,

12:49.246 --> 12:50.857
needs her at home.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.208
I've been to court before.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.863
My sister's trial.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.213
I sat there the whole time,
waiting for a chance

12:59.256 --> 13:00.997
to tell them what I knew,
and then, when the time came,

13:01.041 --> 13:02.956
they wouldn't let me say it.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.132
What wouldn't they let you say?

13:05.175 --> 13:08.918
I... heard his voice.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.181
I knew him.

13:11.225 --> 13:16.230
[laughs]
He was my piano teacher.

13:16.273 --> 13:21.061
I spent every Wednesday with him
for three years.

13:21.104 --> 13:25.369
But, uh, they said
hearing someone's voice

13:25.413 --> 13:30.070
and thinking you know who
they are isn't enough proof,

13:30.113 --> 13:34.074
so I couldn't say it
on the stand.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.858
You didn't see him?

13:35.902 --> 13:39.079
I was sleeping.

13:39.122 --> 13:44.127
He must've come in
through the window, but...

13:44.171 --> 13:47.914
all I know is,
he put a bag over my head

13:47.957 --> 13:50.568
and when I woke up,

13:50.612 --> 13:55.747
he was wrapping tape
around the bag...

13:55.791 --> 13:58.794
and over my mouth.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.016
And he carried me to the closet
and locked me in.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.714
And he said

14:05.757 --> 14:11.024
if I made a sound, he
would kill my mother.

14:13.026 --> 14:17.639
I thought he was
there for her.

14:21.861 --> 14:27.301
Maybe if I'd been awake, none
of this would have happened.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.043
Maybe he wouldn't
have gotten Ella

14:30.086 --> 14:33.133
or my mom
wouldn't have shot him.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.491
They're new, too.

14:44.796 --> 14:48.061
So, today is all about something
called voir dire.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.323
It's kind of our specialty.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.542
It's about interviewing
prospective jurors

14:51.586 --> 14:53.283
and doing everything
we can to make sure

14:53.327 --> 14:55.677
that we pick the right ones,
the ones who are best able

14:55.720 --> 14:58.723
to hear our argument,
sympathize with it, yeah.Okay.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.204
Even though you won't be
testifying today-- no one will--

15:01.248 --> 15:03.990
you have a very important job.

15:04.033 --> 15:07.123
This is when the jurors get
their first look at you.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.386
Prosecutor's gonna want
them to see a murderer,

15:09.430 --> 15:10.866
a public menace.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.434
I want them to see
the schoolteacher,

15:13.477 --> 15:16.219
the grieving mother,

15:16.263 --> 15:17.481
the victim of a
murderous deviant

15:17.525 --> 15:20.441
who took advantage
of a family's trust.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.225
But there's no sign
you can hold up

15:22.269 --> 15:24.575
to show 'em all
those things.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.186
You have to
do it in here.

15:26.229 --> 15:30.451
You have to be it in here and
not just in the courtroom--

15:30.494 --> 15:32.192
from the moment you leave
that cell in the morning

15:32.235 --> 15:34.324
until your head hits the pillow
at night. Can you do that?

15:34.368 --> 15:36.587
Yeah. I can do that.Great.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.416
Now, Benny and
Chunk know exactly

15:39.460 --> 15:41.244
what we're looking
for juror-wise.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.507
Marissa back
at my office...
Wait a second.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.770
You're not coming
to court with us today?

15:45.814 --> 15:47.207
Well, I can't.
I have a...

15:47.250 --> 15:50.253
What did I do?
What did I fall for?

15:50.297 --> 15:51.951
I need a new lawyer. I need...No, you don't.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.866
You need to lower your voice
and stop acting out in public.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.825
Look around. There are
people walking by.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.001
You have no idea
who they are.

15:59.045 --> 16:02.004
Like I told you,
your job starts

16:02.048 --> 16:04.180
the moment you leave
prison in the morning

16:04.224 --> 16:07.836
until you get back
to your cell at night.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.751
Now, I will do everything
in my power to get back

16:09.794 --> 16:12.101
and be by your side
as soon as I can.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.451
But let's not blow this
thing on deportment.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.932
Shall we?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.760
LANFORD: And how many times
did the defendant

16:18.803 --> 16:20.892
hold himself out
to be an attorney?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.677
At least 16.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.853
And what kinds of cases
did he try?

16:24.896 --> 16:26.159
BOONE:
All kinds.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.249
Everything from traffic
violations to murder.

16:29.292 --> 16:31.860
LANFORD: And while we already
know that he didn't have

16:31.903 --> 16:35.603
a law degree, what kind
of education did he have?

16:35.646 --> 16:38.606
High school.
A year of community college.

16:38.649 --> 16:40.912
LANFORD:
High school?

16:40.956 --> 16:42.740
A year of community college.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.960
No further questions,
Your Honor.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.180
Good afternoon.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.095
Good afternoon.

16:49.138 --> 16:52.924
You obtained a subpoena,
went into my client's office,

16:52.968 --> 16:55.144
seized my client's records.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.886
Did you happen to notice what he
charged for his legal services?

16:57.929 --> 16:59.192
Objection. Relevance.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.325
Simply because he didn't charge
a lot of money

17:02.369 --> 17:05.154
doesn't change the fact that
he was breaking the law.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.851
Objection sustained.

17:06.895 --> 17:09.332
The jury will ignore
the question.

17:09.376 --> 17:13.858
When you examined
my client's records,

17:13.902 --> 17:18.950
were you able to ascertain the
sort of clients he represented?

17:18.994 --> 17:20.300
What do you mean?

17:20.343 --> 17:23.346
He didn't represent
rich people, did he?

17:23.390 --> 17:25.131
Objection.
Relevance again.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.654
[sighs]

17:26.697 --> 17:28.525
Objection sustained. Again.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.528
Ms. Dunn, please don't test me.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.401
None of this is relevant
to the charges.

17:34.444 --> 17:37.056
Do you have another question?

17:37.099 --> 17:42.017
Yes, juror number four.
What can I do for you?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.801
Well, I just, uh...

17:45.412 --> 17:47.283
Well, Your Honor, I've been
in some courtrooms

17:47.327 --> 17:49.894
where the judge allows jurors
to ask questions.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.810
Do you have a question,
number four?

17:55.335 --> 17:58.077
Thank you.

18:00.862 --> 18:04.953
"Did the defendant ever lose
any of his cases?"

18:11.351 --> 18:14.180
No. He didn't.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.529
He never lost a case.

18:17.705 --> 18:20.447
Thanks.

18:22.449 --> 18:26.453
Our juror wants to know if any
of the defendant's clients

18:26.496 --> 18:29.151
ever complained
about his work.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.674
Not that I know of.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.766
Um, juror four,
why don't you just go ahead

18:35.810 --> 18:37.203
and ask your questions out loud?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.204
Your Honor.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.902
Overruled.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.296
Sit.
BULL:
Okay.

18:43.339 --> 18:46.168
Well, hasn't the defendant
already stipulated

18:46.212 --> 18:48.214
that going forward,
he will no longer offer

18:48.257 --> 18:50.825
his services as an attorney
until such time

18:50.868 --> 18:52.609
as he completes his education
and passes the bar?

18:52.653 --> 18:55.003
That's my understanding.

18:55.046 --> 18:57.397
And one last question:
how did Mr. Gorman,

18:57.440 --> 18:58.615
the defendant, get caught?

18:58.659 --> 19:01.662
He defended a man
falsely accused

19:01.705 --> 19:04.360
of being involved
in a drug-trafficking ring.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.623
Which I'm assuming he won.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.668
He did.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.844
So... [chuckles]

19:09.887 --> 19:11.106
a guy with a high
school education--

19:11.150 --> 19:12.977
sorry, one year of
community college--

19:13.021 --> 19:15.632
beats a City of New
York prosecutor.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.808
You think maybe that's why
we're all sitting here?

19:17.852 --> 19:20.376
Isn't it reasonable
to assume

19:20.420 --> 19:22.770
that if Mr. Gorman had lost
that particular case,

19:22.813 --> 19:24.554
the prosecutor wouldn't
have investigated him

19:24.598 --> 19:26.295
and we wouldn't be
sitting here today?

19:26.339 --> 19:27.818
Doesn't that sound
like an abuse of power?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.952
I suppose.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.824
Ah. I have no further questions.

19:33.868 --> 19:36.087
And I have no further questions.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.828
The defense rests.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.352
HUDSON:
Then, tomorrow morning

19:39.395 --> 19:40.962
the jury will hear
closing arguments

19:41.005 --> 19:43.660
and commence deliberations.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.185
Court is adjourned.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.361
The good news is there's nothing
left but closing arguments

19:48.404 --> 19:49.275
and deliberations.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.102
The bad news is,
at this point,

19:51.146 --> 19:53.975
I don't think either side
is carrying the day

19:54.018 --> 19:56.934
and I'm worried that unless
something miraculous happens,

19:56.978 --> 19:59.763
I could be locked up
in that jury room

19:59.807 --> 20:01.548
for a couple more days
deliberating.

20:01.591 --> 20:04.333
Can we just take a moment
and talk about Heather Spiro?

20:04.377 --> 20:06.509
I think if she doesn't

20:06.553 --> 20:09.773
see Jason Bull sitting by
her side in court pretty soon,

20:09.817 --> 20:11.384
she's likely to fire us.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.515
Which would defeat
the whole point

20:12.559 --> 20:14.343
of our having
gotten involved,

20:14.387 --> 20:15.953
which was to generate
some good press.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.955
Well, I think
you're both overreacting.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.479
I disagree.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.437
I think they're telling
it to you straight.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.918
We actually had a really
good day at court.

20:23.961 --> 20:26.312
I think we got a jury that
you'll be really pleased with.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.488
The one problem is, when they
glance at the defendant,

20:28.531 --> 20:31.447
all they see is
an incredibly angry lady.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.365
Okay. I'll walk her
into the courtroom again

20:36.409 --> 20:37.497
tomorrow morning.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.107
And then you'll turn around,

20:39.150 --> 20:41.283
and Chunk and I will be stuck
with trying to convince her

20:41.327 --> 20:42.545
that everything's
going to be all right.

20:42.589 --> 20:44.373
And it will be.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.896
It's the best I can do.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.507
Everyone understands.

20:47.550 --> 20:50.292
And you still want me to go with
EED in my opening statement?

20:51.554 --> 20:54.383
EED it is.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.211
BULL: Danny, we have
the daughter all teed up?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.691
We need her testimony.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.345
I don't think
you want to do that.

20:59.388 --> 21:00.607
Well, then you'd be wrong

21:00.650 --> 21:02.348
'cause that's exactly
what we need to do.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.132
She's the only witness we have,

21:04.175 --> 21:07.875
at least the only one who can
provide the jury with something

21:07.918 --> 21:10.181
even close to a first-person
account of what happened

21:10.225 --> 21:13.359
the night the victim
was snatched from her home.

21:13.402 --> 21:17.014
Bull, she's 15 and
she's cutting herself.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.494
She's got a tattoo
on her neck

21:18.538 --> 21:20.235
and piercings in her face.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.628
And who knows
what she's doing

21:21.671 --> 21:23.325
to the other parts of her
body that I can't see.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.196
Clearly she's really fragile,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.503
and I'm afraid
if you put her on the...Well, stop being afraid.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.331
We need her testimony.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.464
Well, there is
another problem with that.

21:31.507 --> 21:33.335
Heather Spiro won't have it.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.511
She knows her daughter
is falling apart,

21:35.555 --> 21:38.035
and she's refusing
to let her testify.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.386
So she wants to go to prison
for the rest of her life?

21:40.429 --> 21:41.865
She feels there's got

21:41.909 --> 21:43.824
to be a way to present
her case without...

21:43.867 --> 21:46.479
And neither of you could
disabuse her of that?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.742
Nope. But I'm sure
you can do it

21:48.785 --> 21:52.136
during your 90-second walk
with her into court tomorrow.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.573
Night, all.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.922
I have got a trial
to prepare for.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.494
Well, I guess we're done here.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.718
BULL:
Don't speak.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.764
Three things.

22:10.807 --> 22:13.854
First thing, I don't give a damn
who you're pissed off at or why.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.246
When you're sitting
in that courtroom,

22:15.290 --> 22:16.509
you better be looking
like a victim

22:16.552 --> 22:18.032
and not like the
Wicked Witch of the West,

22:18.075 --> 22:20.208
or you're not gonna fire me,
I will quit.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.732
And if I do that, there's not
a law firm in this town

22:22.776 --> 22:25.518
worth a damn that will touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

22:25.561 --> 22:28.259
Second thing.
I am moving heaven and earth

22:28.303 --> 22:30.523
to get down here
and be by your side.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.352
I have every hope
that tomorrow morning

22:33.395 --> 22:35.789
I will be there,
but I can't promise.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.791
What I can promise is that
I am totally involved

22:37.834 --> 22:40.620
in your defense, and those
two men standing behind me

22:40.663 --> 22:42.361
are doing everything
they are supposed to be doing.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.537
But if you're unhappy,
or you have a better idea,

22:44.580 --> 22:47.627
or you have some secret plan
for getting away with murder

22:47.670 --> 22:49.498
on a New York City sidewalk
in broad daylight,

22:49.542 --> 22:50.847
I'd love to hear it.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.373
I didn't think so.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.680
And third, there is one thing
I am certain of.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.290
If we don't put your daughter
on that stand,

22:59.334 --> 23:00.901
you are going to prison.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.947
And the only question will be
for a quarter of a century

23:03.991 --> 23:05.427
or the rest of your life?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.429
She'll never do it.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
And I'll never let her.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.824
Then we are all
wasting our time.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.217
No. Not you.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.828
Not yet.

23:14.871 --> 23:18.440
You actually haven't given me
any of your time to waste.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.442
[chuckles]
You guys are right.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.226
She's a peach.
Well, maybe you haven't heard.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.445
I like to win.

23:23.489 --> 23:27.101
So buckle up,
put on a happy face,

23:27.144 --> 23:29.233
and get ready to have
your mind changed.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.416
[indistinct chatter]

23:47.513 --> 23:49.906
You know, if I were advising
that Gorman fella,

23:49.950 --> 23:52.735
I'd tell him to do the, uh,
closing argument himself.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.346
He needs to show that jury that,
even though he doesn't have

23:55.390 --> 23:57.261
a law license,
he's a great litigator.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.481
Would you stop that, please?

23:59.525 --> 24:01.309
We're not supposed
to be doing this.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.658
Jurors are not supposed
to talk to defendants

24:02.702 --> 24:04.312
outside the courtroom.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.401
[elevator bell chimes]

24:06.445 --> 24:08.229
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.492
I didn't say a word.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.407
BENNY: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

24:12.451 --> 24:15.410
I intend to prove to you
that this,

24:15.454 --> 24:17.412
this was no vigilante killing.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.111
That this was an act of
desperation committed by a woman

24:21.155 --> 24:25.594
who fell victim to a mental
condition called EED.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.944
Extreme emotional disturbance.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.424
Objection.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.034
Objection?

24:32.775 --> 24:36.562
Y... Your Honor, I'm still
giving my opening statement.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.302
EED, really, Your Honor?

24:38.346 --> 24:39.739
The State would like
to be heard.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.176
Oh, well, the defense
would like to be heard, too.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.265
As a matter of fact,
the defense would like

24:44.308 --> 24:45.527
to finish
their opening statement.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.225
Wow. We've barely started. Okay.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.750
Want to see you both
in my chambers.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.187
[gallery murmuring]

24:53.230 --> 24:56.756
I love the law.

24:56.799 --> 24:59.846
I know that must sound
ridiculous coming from someone

24:59.889 --> 25:05.329
who's on trial for breaking it,
but it is the truth.

25:05.373 --> 25:08.507
I never planned
on impersonating a-an attorney.

25:08.550 --> 25:12.380
Five years ago,
a woman friend asked me

25:12.423 --> 25:15.818
to go with her to, um,
small claims court,

25:15.862 --> 25:17.428
offer moral support.

25:17.472 --> 25:22.477
Um, I was wearing a suit
'cause, um... [chuckles]

25:22.521 --> 25:25.698
I was a-a mortician
and I had a funeral that day.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.917
And anyway, uh,
the judge started asking

25:27.961 --> 25:29.136
a bunch of questions.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.964
And my friend kind of froze.

25:31.007 --> 25:36.404
So I started answering for her.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.362
[laughs softly]

25:38.406 --> 25:42.105
Next thing I know,
my friend won her case.

25:42.149 --> 25:46.153
And as we, uh,
left the courtroom, this guy

25:46.196 --> 25:49.373
came running up to me
to tell me how impressed he was,

25:49.417 --> 25:50.723
and would I represent him

25:50.766 --> 25:53.726
the following week
i-in traffic court?

25:53.769 --> 25:56.511
One case led to another.

25:56.555 --> 26:01.429
A-And, and the amazing thing
was, I, I never lost.

26:03.170 --> 26:07.217
I also, uh, never charged
more than $35 an hour.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.263
I know that sounds crazy,
but like I said,

26:09.306 --> 26:12.005
I, I love the law.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.094
And thank God for the Internet,

26:14.137 --> 26:17.837
'cause anything I didn't know,
I, I cou-- I could look up.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.057
But of course,
I-I knew it was wrong.

26:21.101 --> 26:24.974
Although I'm not sure
it should be.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.411
I mean, doesn't the law
belong to everyone?

26:27.455 --> 26:31.024
Not just people with money
who can take seven years

26:31.067 --> 26:32.852
off of their lives
and go to school?

26:32.895 --> 26:36.638
Or-or clients who, who can
bankroll a defense?

26:37.683 --> 26:39.293
[clears throat]

26:39.336 --> 26:43.602
But, um, that's a conversation
for another day.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.603
[clears throat]

26:48.389 --> 26:50.391
I'm sorry.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.307
Sorry for what I did,

26:53.350 --> 26:55.526
but I-I would beg you
not to find me guilty.

26:55.570 --> 26:59.487
Because if I'm convicted,
even when I pass the bar,

26:59.530 --> 27:04.927
I will not ever be allowed to
practice my beloved law again.

27:09.105 --> 27:12.892
Also, this will be
the first case I ever lose.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.725
BULL:
Benny!

27:25.600 --> 27:27.558
Terrific.

27:27.602 --> 27:29.430
I'm here.

27:29.473 --> 27:32.955
Oh, it's Benny of Arc.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.174
[groans]

27:34.217 --> 27:35.479
Don't make fun.

27:35.523 --> 27:39.570
My back has declared war
on the rest of my body.

27:39.614 --> 27:41.355
It's all in your head.

27:41.398 --> 27:42.530
Nope. It's all in my back.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.532
[grunts]

27:44.575 --> 27:46.360
Why are you in such a good mood?

27:46.403 --> 27:49.668
I have completed
my service as juror.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.192
The accused was found
not guilty.

27:52.235 --> 27:53.584
Unanimously.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.456
Wow.But the big news is,

27:55.499 --> 27:56.849
I am back on the team.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.502
Ready to head into court

27:58.546 --> 28:00.591
and fight for the freedom
of our delightful client.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.637
Now,

28:02.681 --> 28:05.074
what's making you so anxious
that your back's gone out?

28:05.118 --> 28:07.686
The judge threw out
our EED defense.

28:07.729 --> 28:11.037
Didn't even let me get
through my opening statement.

28:11.080 --> 28:15.302
[sighing]:
Now my back's starting to hurt.

28:18.392 --> 28:21.090
What if we lose?

28:21.134 --> 28:24.790
Remember, we don't have
to change every juror's mind.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.009
Just one will get us a mistrial.

28:27.053 --> 28:29.403
Three or four, and the D.A.
might even dismiss the charges.

28:29.446 --> 28:32.754
When you were a kid, you
believed in Santa, didn't you?

28:32.798 --> 28:34.582
Till I was about 35.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.062
Ah.

28:37.106 --> 28:39.369
You think
what she did was wrong?

28:39.413 --> 28:42.155
Yes.

28:42.198 --> 28:44.418
You think punishing her
for it is right?

28:44.461 --> 28:46.376
No.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.771
Me either.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.773
Benny, we can win this thing.

28:51.817 --> 28:55.168
You have a plan B?

28:55.211 --> 28:58.911
I have a plan B-minus.

28:58.954 --> 29:04.220
It's not great, and it still
presents the same big problem.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.092
Okay. Lay it on me.

29:06.135 --> 29:09.443
We go in there tomorrow and
announce a new defense theory.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.662
It's called defense of others.

29:11.706 --> 29:12.794
Ah.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.101
Defense of others.
I know it well.

29:15.144 --> 29:18.408
It's kind of like self-defense,
only we argue that

29:18.452 --> 29:21.629
Heather shot that man in order
to protect her daughter.

29:21.672 --> 29:25.546
Which I believe with all
my heart is the truth.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.766
Just can't figure out
how to prove it.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.465
[grunting]:
Great. The pain is back.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.510
[exhales]

29:39.516 --> 29:41.431
Who did you say it was?

29:41.475 --> 29:42.955
AUNT:
A friend of your mom's.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.523
Hello?

29:46.567 --> 29:48.525
Penny Spiro.

29:48.569 --> 29:51.267
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

29:51.311 --> 29:52.703
Sorry to show up
on your doorstep

29:52.747 --> 29:54.488
so early in the morning,
but I'm part

29:54.531 --> 29:56.403
of your mom's
legal team,

29:56.446 --> 29:58.405
and I desperately need you
to do two things I've been told

29:58.448 --> 29:59.841
you're not gonna want to do.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.843
I won't testify.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.498
That's only the first one.

30:04.541 --> 30:08.981
I also need you to convince
your mom to let you do it.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.244
It's a pretty simple system.
Uh, four cameras.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.636
Three inside the store.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.203
One that focuses
on the cash register

30:14.247 --> 30:15.857
and the customers as they pay.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.425
Two that show customers walking
through the aisles of the store

30:18.468 --> 30:20.296
from opposite sides
of the store.

30:20.340 --> 30:22.864
And a wireless camera,
mounted without permission

30:22.908 --> 30:25.345
on the lamp post outside
the store, presumably,

30:25.388 --> 30:27.956
to capture people coming
into and out of the store,

30:28.000 --> 30:29.871
specifically those
who haven't paid.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.699
Shoplifters, that kind of thing.

30:31.742 --> 30:35.877
And when you examined the DVR,
what did you discover?

30:35.921 --> 30:38.532
I discovered that
on four consecutive days,

30:38.575 --> 30:40.403
beginning with June 11,

30:40.447 --> 30:43.667
the defendant planted herself
outside the store.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.974
Twice in her car,
twice on foot.

30:46.018 --> 30:48.237
And in your
professional opinion,

30:48.281 --> 30:50.022
what was she doing?BENNY:
Objection, Your Honor.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.546
The assistant district attorney
is asking

30:52.589 --> 30:53.764
the witness to speculate.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.723
She's asking
a professional investigator

30:55.766 --> 30:57.377
to give her expert opinion

30:57.420 --> 30:59.379
based on the evidence
in front of her.

30:59.422 --> 31:00.859
Overruled.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.991
You may answer the question.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.472
Waiting. She's waiting.

31:05.515 --> 31:06.516
Waiting.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.562
Any idea for what?

31:08.605 --> 31:10.520
Well, I think
that became apparent

31:10.564 --> 31:14.002
on the fifth day,
when she executed Mr. Briggs.

31:14.046 --> 31:15.482
WAKEFIELD:
The prosecution has no further
questions for this witness.

31:15.525 --> 31:18.093
I need to hear
something positive.

31:18.137 --> 31:21.575
Well, this jury
is positively unanimous.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.229
Defense will cross-examine this
witness after the lunch break.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.318
Court is in recess.[gavel bangs]

31:25.361 --> 31:27.363
Thank God.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.540
Nice of you to join us.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.586
Ah. I thought so, too.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.550
Oh, my God. Penny.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.252
Oh...

31:46.295 --> 31:50.386
I told Dr. Bull everything.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.479
That I'm the reason
all this happened.

31:57.437 --> 32:01.441
And I want to take the stand.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.746
BENNY:
Penny...

32:02.790 --> 32:07.099
could you please tell
the jury about the day

32:07.142 --> 32:10.015
they found Ella and caught
the man who killed her?

32:11.538 --> 32:16.978
Well... it was
the worst day of my life.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.763
[laughing nervously]:
And also,

32:19.807 --> 32:22.984
weirdly, kind of the best.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.855
How do you mean?

32:24.899 --> 32:27.075
PENNY:
Well, uh,

32:27.119 --> 32:31.514
it was horrible because it...

32:31.558 --> 32:35.605
it was the moment I absolutely
knew my sister was gone.

32:35.649 --> 32:38.608
Uh...

32:38.652 --> 32:40.654
There was no denying it.

32:40.697 --> 32:44.310
She was never coming back.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.011
But later that night, um,

32:50.055 --> 32:54.363
it finally started to sink in
that they caught him,

32:54.407 --> 32:55.930
the guy who did it.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.889
They had him,
and he was going

32:58.933 --> 33:01.936
to prison forever.

33:04.547 --> 33:10.031
I remember my mother holding me

33:10.075 --> 33:15.036
and telling me...
it was going to be okay.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.346
That it-it may never go back
to the way it was.

33:22.391 --> 33:27.092
But it would go back
to a new normal.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.485
I could live my life again.

33:29.529 --> 33:33.054
I could leave my house.

33:33.098 --> 33:36.362
I-I could go to school,
see my, see my friends.

33:36.405 --> 33:39.669
In a couple of years,
go to college.

33:39.713 --> 33:41.889
Have a future.

33:42.933 --> 33:45.849
We were safe.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.504
BENNY:
And then?

33:50.115 --> 33:54.554
And then they let him
out of jail.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.860
And I realized

33:56.904 --> 33:59.863
there was never
gonna be a normal.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.953
And what did that feel like?

34:03.998 --> 34:06.044
We were terrified.

34:06.087 --> 34:08.307
I was terrified.

34:08.350 --> 34:12.398
My mom had to drive me
to and from school again.

34:12.441 --> 34:15.966
And, uh,
when we got home,

34:16.010 --> 34:18.534
we'd lock the doors
and check the windows.

34:18.578 --> 34:23.539
And... I didn't see my friends.

34:23.583 --> 34:25.976
I didn't play soccer.

34:26.020 --> 34:27.935
I dropped out of chorus.

34:27.978 --> 34:29.110
And it just

34:29.154 --> 34:31.460
went on like this?

34:31.504 --> 34:34.072
F-For a few months.

34:34.115 --> 34:38.424
So I went to my mom and
I told her that if I couldn't

34:38.467 --> 34:44.038
live a normal life,
that I was going to kill myself.

34:46.301 --> 34:49.609
BENNY: And what was
her reaction to that?

34:49.652 --> 34:50.784
PENNY:
We started experimenting.

34:50.827 --> 34:56.181
I-I'd go out for, like, an hour.

34:56.224 --> 35:00.446
Or I'd walk home from school
with a friend.

35:00.489 --> 35:04.667
I knew those must have been
the longest hours for my mother,

35:04.711 --> 35:07.975
but I started
to feel alive again.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.717
BENNY:
And...

35:10.760 --> 35:13.328
what happened on June 10?

35:13.372 --> 35:16.723
I was walking home from school
and I felt like a soda,

35:16.766 --> 35:18.725
so I stopped at the bodega.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.161
By yourself?

35:20.205 --> 35:21.858
Uh, by myself.

35:21.902 --> 35:25.123
And, um, I went
to the refrigerator case

35:25.166 --> 35:29.344
and I grabbed a can

35:29.388 --> 35:33.696
and I turned around
and he was standing there.

35:33.740 --> 35:34.871
Mr. Briggs?

35:34.915 --> 35:36.090
Mm-hmm.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.397
And did he say anything to you?

35:38.440 --> 35:41.748
No. He was just staring at me.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.142
Did he touch you?

35:44.185 --> 35:45.752
Try to reach
out to you?

35:45.795 --> 35:46.709
No.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.408
And what did you do?

35:49.451 --> 35:52.193
I put the can down
and I ran out of there.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.847
Did you go home?

35:53.890 --> 35:57.894
No. I-I went to the coffee shop
next door and I called my mom.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.854
And she came
and picked me up.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.029
BENNY:
That was on June 10,

36:02.072 --> 36:03.813
and on June 11 your mom began

36:03.857 --> 36:05.554
looking for Mr. Briggs
at the bodega.

36:05.598 --> 36:06.860
WAKEFIELD:
Objection.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.036
That's not a question.
Counsel is testifying.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.690
I apologize, Your Honor.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.214
I just have one more question.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.260
The last time

36:15.303 --> 36:20.221
you were in court, during your
little sister's murder trial,

36:20.265 --> 36:21.657
you were on the stand,

36:21.701 --> 36:24.660
and there was something
that A.D.A. Wakefield

36:24.704 --> 36:30.318
wouldn't allow you to say
that was important to you.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.015
You want to say it now?

36:32.059 --> 36:33.234
Your Honor.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.410
Sit down, Ms. Wakefield.

36:36.846 --> 36:40.894
I just wanted to tell the court

36:40.937 --> 36:44.245
that I heard his voice.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.248
When he broke in
that night

36:47.292 --> 36:51.731
and covered my head and put me
in the closet, he spoke to me,

36:51.774 --> 36:55.735
and I knew instantly

36:55.778 --> 36:57.780
who it was.

36:59.826 --> 37:01.828
We all knew who it was.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.746
Why did you let him out?

37:09.052 --> 37:13.753
The defense rests, Your Honor.

37:13.796 --> 37:18.410
I can't explain it,
but nothing is moving here.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.807
[elevator bell chimes]

37:30.770 --> 37:31.814
CABLE'S VOICE:
Hey, Dr. Bull.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.860
Hey, Cable.

37:44.523 --> 37:46.264
Uh...

37:46.307 --> 37:49.441
Uh, yeah, I just put
everything right over there.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.486
[sighs]
Thank you.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.536
Gabriel.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.102
Excuse me?

37:59.146 --> 38:01.888
My name. My name is Gabriel.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.717
Okay.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.155
But yours can't
seriously be Danny, right?

38:08.198 --> 38:10.331
Danielle.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.986
Ah, you see, well,
that makes more sense.

38:13.029 --> 38:14.944
Listen, can you tell

38:14.988 --> 38:18.644
your-your friend's family that
I-I need to clean the place out?

38:18.687 --> 38:20.646
It's just, the landlord wants

38:20.689 --> 38:23.866
to put the apartment
back on the market.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.739
Yeah, I'll-I'll
let 'em know.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.615
I would like to go
to the funeral.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.923
Or the memorial, whatever
it is that they're having.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.533
You know.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.144
Okay.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.624
[clears throat]

38:42.668 --> 38:43.843
I'll-I'll find you, I'll, um,

38:43.886 --> 38:47.194
I'll let you know
when I-I hear something.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.717
[phone ringing]Thank you.

38:48.761 --> 38:50.589
No, please.

38:50.632 --> 38:51.894
Excuse me.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.592
Hello.

38:53.635 --> 38:57.378
Oh, my God. Uh, yeah.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.162
Work, um...

38:59.206 --> 39:01.339
A jury we've been waiting for
just came in.

39:01.382 --> 39:02.731
Thanks again for your help.

39:02.775 --> 39:03.906
Ah.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.082
[chuckles]
Sorry.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.000
Thank you.

39:11.044 --> 39:15.483
It seems in the matter
of The State v. Heather Spiro,

39:15.527 --> 39:18.704
our jury is hopelessly
deadlocked.

39:18.747 --> 39:20.836
I say "hopelessly" because,
according to this note,

39:20.880 --> 39:24.623
while six of our jurors
find the defendant guilty,

39:24.666 --> 39:27.582
six believe her to be innocent.

39:27.626 --> 39:31.673
I see no other choice
but to declare a mistrial.

39:31.717 --> 39:35.068
Would the prosecutor like to
schedule a date for a retrial?

39:45.470 --> 39:48.168
I believe, in their inability
to send a unified verdict,

39:48.211 --> 39:51.476
our jurors are sending
an important message.

39:51.519 --> 39:54.653
Perhaps because of all
these months served behind bars,

39:54.696 --> 39:57.525
perhaps in the loss of a child,

39:57.569 --> 39:59.484
justice has
already been served.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.094
The State
no longer believes

40:01.137 --> 40:03.575
this woman is a threat to
society, and with that in mind,

40:03.618 --> 40:06.795
in the interest of justice,
we move to dismiss all charges.

40:06.839 --> 40:08.797

[elevator bell chimes]

40:47.619 --> 40:49.621
[indistinct chatter]

41:05.201 --> 41:07.726
Can I help you? You
look a little lost.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.075
I'm sorry, uh,

41:09.118 --> 41:11.686
my name is Ellen McCrory.

41:11.730 --> 41:13.253
My daughter used to work here.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.734
I'm just here to pick up
some of her things.

41:15.777 --> 41:19.520
Boy, this is
so not what I pictured.

41:19.564 --> 41:22.131
Mrs. McCrory.

41:22.175 --> 41:23.829
Cable's mother.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.136
I'm so sorry.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.445
I'm Jason Bull.
Your daughter worked for me.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.969
Oh, my. You...

41:34.013 --> 41:35.144
You're him.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.929
Hmm.

41:36.972 --> 41:39.105
Well, she, uh,
she talked about you a lot.

41:39.148 --> 41:41.977
Ah. Lies. Nothing but lies.

41:45.067 --> 41:46.504
I miss her...

41:50.116 --> 41:51.987
Stay right here. I'll get
somebody to help you.

41:52.031 --> 41:54.033
Okay, thank you.

42:08.177 --> 42:10.179
[exhales]

42:13.879 --> 42:16.446
Marissa, do me a favor.

42:16.490 --> 42:20.059
Cable's mom is in the War Room,

42:20.102 --> 42:24.367
and she's looking
a little lost, so...

42:24.411 --> 42:26.369
Exactly.

42:26.413 --> 42:28.241
Appreciate it.

42:28.284 --> 42:30.025
Thanks.
