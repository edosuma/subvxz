WEBVTT

00:00.951 --> 00:02.885
Tomorrow's Big Trash Day,

00:02.887 --> 00:05.020
the garbage men's
favorite day of the year.

00:05.022 --> 00:08.490
But this is Big Trash Eve... my time,

00:08.492 --> 00:10.425
when the streets are lined with gold!

00:10.427 --> 00:12.160
Isn't all this stuff broken?

00:12.162 --> 00:15.164
What's broken about a mirrored
headboard with a crack in it?

00:15.166 --> 00:16.565
A toilet with no seat?

00:16.567 --> 00:18.033
Most of a hose?

00:18.035 --> 00:20.569
Ooh! What's that?

00:20.571 --> 00:23.172
This might be the last big TV.

00:23.174 --> 00:24.439
It's so deep.

00:24.441 --> 00:27.176
I have to get this home it's so deep.

00:29.179 --> 00:30.645
So heavy.

00:30.647 --> 00:32.781
So splintery.

00:32.783 --> 00:35.518
All the weight is distributed so oddly.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.919
This, I like.

00:36.921 --> 00:39.454
This speaks to me.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.524
Mm. Nice, loud springs.

00:41.526 --> 00:44.059
Baby lambs on a soiled comforter.

00:44.061 --> 00:45.895
And hello!

00:47.998 --> 00:49.464
Dare I?

00:49.857 --> 00:51.133
Perfect fit!

00:51.135 --> 00:52.801
Stan, you can finally take me back

00:52.803 --> 00:55.270
to The Green Burrito
without having to worry.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.005
Ugh. Green Burrito.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.007
No, thank you.

No. No more trash.

01:33.444 --> 01:35.644
This stuff isn't trash...
unless you think

01:35.646 --> 01:39.181
a brand-new-to-us dehumidifier is trash.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.783
It <i> is</i> trash.

01:40.785 --> 01:42.651
That's outrageous.

01:42.653 --> 01:44.920
Well, what about an electric fondue pot?

01:44.922 --> 01:48.323
Splice a few wires,
bingo-bango, hot cheese on tap.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.658
I don't like fondue.

01:49.660 --> 01:52.194
That's outrageous.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.996
But what about this stunner?

01:53.998 --> 01:55.864
Some dirty-ass mattress?

01:55.866 --> 01:57.399
Stop being outrageous. Look.

01:57.401 --> 02:00.535
There's a beautiful
Spanish word painted on it.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.671
- _
- It's like a Diego Rivera painting.

02:02.673 --> 02:04.940
We don't want any of this stuff.

02:04.942 --> 02:08.276
Seems like you're all
missing the big picture.

02:08.279 --> 02:12.014
A beautiful 34-inch picture.

02:12.016 --> 02:14.082
They don't make 'em like this
anymore, gang.

02:14.084 --> 02:16.885
It's the new biggest piece
of furniture in the house.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.087
The couch has been put on notice.

02:19.089 --> 02:20.555
- Ohh.
- Aww.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.091
He's so cute.

02:23.915 --> 02:25.360
He's a baby now?

02:27.231 --> 02:29.999
Son of a bitch! He is cute!

02:33.103 --> 02:35.971
I will never let anything
bad happen to you.

02:35.973 --> 02:37.840
Okay, fun is fun, but I must insist

02:37.842 --> 02:39.908
that we now focus on the TV.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.777
That thing can't stay in here.
It could fall on the baby.

02:42.779 --> 02:45.614
Maybe it <i>should</i> fall on the baby.

02:50.254 --> 02:54.123
I'll never understand
the weight distribution.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.695
Fake baby.

03:00.697 --> 03:03.298
This TV is what's real... real fun.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.634
What's this smushed
into the cable input?

03:05.636 --> 03:07.436
Hmm. Dog shit.

03:07.438 --> 03:08.671
I'll use the antenna.

03:10.507 --> 03:11.840
What a blast.

03:11.842 --> 03:13.476
It's a party down here.

03:15.646 --> 03:17.446
Hmm. No signal.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.715
Let's try the old splits.

03:19.745 --> 03:21.250
Nothing.

03:21.252 --> 03:22.918
Do a little scissor kick.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.052
Side saddle?

03:24.054 --> 03:26.521
Nope. Now the one
people don't like to see,

03:26.523 --> 03:27.990
but sometimes it works.

03:27.992 --> 03:31.260
Both of them together straight up!

03:31.262 --> 03:32.327
Hmm.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.333
Shh. Don't wake up the ba...

03:40.871 --> 03:43.606
Everyone's doing stupid stuff except me.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.833
Welcome, nighthawks.

04:10.835 --> 04:14.236
We've been expecting you.

04:14.238 --> 04:17.439
The hour's late,
but the party is just getting started.

04:17.440 --> 04:18.841
I'm Alistair Covax,

04:18.843 --> 04:23.178
your host for a sophisticated
little soiree with jazz,

04:23.180 --> 04:26.581
stimulating conversation,
beautiful ladies,

04:26.583 --> 04:29.051
and more jazz.

04:29.053 --> 04:30.385
Hmm.

04:30.387 --> 04:31.720
Look. It's Charlie,

04:31.722 --> 04:34.657
sincerely one of the best white,
non-union jazz pianists

04:34.659 --> 04:36.859
in the entire city... top five.

04:36.861 --> 04:40.195
Charlie, play some
of those notes you know I like.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.199
What is this show?

04:45.336 --> 04:47.602
No results for Alistair Covax.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.472
"Nighthawks' Hideaway."

04:49.474 --> 04:52.607
Nothing. Why is there
no record of this show?

04:52.609 --> 04:54.076
I need answers.

04:54.078 --> 04:55.578
TV answers.

04:55.579 --> 04:56.679
_

04:59.350 --> 05:02.617
The star's of "Hawaii Five-O"
are in a prank war!

05:02.619 --> 05:05.488
You think "Wheel of Fortune"
is on at 8:00?

05:05.490 --> 05:07.089
You're fired!

05:07.091 --> 05:09.492
- What, what, what?!
- I recently came into possession

05:09.494 --> 05:12.160
of a deep TV...
no need to congratulate me...

05:12.162 --> 05:16.031
and I saw a 1960s show called
"Nighthawks' Hideaway."

05:16.033 --> 05:17.632
There's no such show.

05:17.634 --> 05:19.568
There's never been such a show.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.304
But every few months, some lonely nutjob

05:22.306 --> 05:24.239
comes in asking about it.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.909
Oh, trust me. I am not a nutjob.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.577
Good. Good.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.046
Word is these nutjobs get together

05:31.048 --> 05:33.648
at the Ukrainian Cultural Center

05:33.650 --> 05:36.585
to talk about this show
that doesn't exist.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.053
Cultural Center, huh?

05:38.055 --> 05:39.855
I mean, I saw the show with my own eyes,

05:39.857 --> 05:42.324
but nutjobs like that make me sick.

05:42.326 --> 05:44.727
Me too, pal. You get it.

05:44.729 --> 05:46.729
Someone should round these nutjobs up,

05:46.731 --> 05:49.598
put them in a locked cage,
and just drop it in the sea.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.334
Well, I don't know about that.

05:52.336 --> 05:55.044
- _
- _

05:55.139 --> 05:57.573
Hopefully these people
can give me some answers.

05:59.410 --> 06:01.009
Hi, Stan!

06:01.011 --> 06:02.945
Sit. Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

06:02.947 --> 06:05.814
Uh...

06:05.816 --> 06:08.551
So, you've seen the show.

06:08.553 --> 06:10.685
Yeah. Strange there's no record of it.

06:10.687 --> 06:12.487
It gets stranger than that.

06:12.489 --> 06:13.956
There's only one episode,

06:13.958 --> 06:16.892
and it reruns over and over
and over on Channel 36.

06:16.894 --> 06:19.294
And get this. Come closer. Come closer.

06:19.296 --> 06:21.496
No, thank you.

06:21.498 --> 06:24.899
There's only one episode,
but it changes...

06:24.901 --> 06:28.170
Little things,
little differences in the show.

06:28.172 --> 06:29.572
I keep track of them.

06:29.574 --> 06:30.905
Where's everybody else?

06:30.907 --> 06:32.507
There used to be more people,

06:32.509 --> 06:34.843
but one by one, they stopped coming.

06:34.845 --> 06:37.112
It's so good to have you here, Stan.

06:37.114 --> 06:38.914
It's not just me anymore.

06:38.916 --> 06:41.183
It's <i>you</i> and me cracking the case

06:41.185 --> 06:42.918
of the "Nighthawks' Hideaway."

06:42.920 --> 06:45.921
We're the same now... two men obsessed.

06:45.923 --> 06:49.124
Ooh! It's like I'm looking in a mirror!

06:49.126 --> 06:50.493
No, thank you.

06:52.329 --> 06:55.798
Sometimes when the jazz is playing,
I like to do this.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.602
I move my chin just a little.

07:01.872 --> 07:04.206
This strange show.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.742
You stop bothering Stan!

07:06.786 --> 07:09.278
Is... Is that...

07:09.280 --> 07:11.546
It couldn't be.

07:11.548 --> 07:12.615
Tuttle?

07:12.617 --> 07:14.749
No. That's impossible.

07:14.751 --> 07:16.418
Wow! Great jazz!

07:16.420 --> 07:18.887
Shh. We're appreciating the jazz.

07:18.889 --> 07:21.657
Oh, this jazz is so good!

07:25.729 --> 07:28.196
Let me ask you something, Stu.

07:28.198 --> 07:32.734
Two years in, are we any
better off with Hawaii a state?

07:32.736 --> 07:36.404
If the Ruskies got
control of that lava...

07:36.406 --> 07:37.873
game over.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.676
How can Tuttle be on this old show?

07:42.280 --> 07:44.813
Huh. No sign of Tuttle.

07:44.887 --> 07:47.483
But maybe...

07:47.485 --> 07:49.585
Every time.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.960
Ugh. What is that smell?

08:02.766 --> 08:05.567
They're both contributing.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.503
There's a beauty.

08:09.907 --> 08:12.308
"I must go in!"

08:15.913 --> 08:18.380
A shadow puppet theater of sorts.

08:18.382 --> 08:20.916
I wish I had time for
such childish games.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.685
Duck! Duck, duck!

08:25.323 --> 08:27.589
May I hold baby Roger?

08:27.591 --> 08:29.191
Make sure to support his head.

08:29.193 --> 08:31.059
Yeah, no shit.

08:33.131 --> 08:35.597
You guys are not gonna
believe where Tuttle is.

08:35.599 --> 08:38.133
Come downstairs.

08:38.135 --> 08:39.868
I don't know why it's not coming in now.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.538
I saw him. Tuttle was inside the TV!

08:42.539 --> 08:46.742
Stan, you're down here by
yourself watching static.

08:46.744 --> 08:49.411
I can watch static upstairs.

08:49.413 --> 08:50.946
Why don't you come upstairs, Dad?

08:50.948 --> 08:53.149
Yeah, aren't you lonely down here?

08:53.151 --> 08:55.584
Lonely?! I have a TV!

08:57.821 --> 08:58.954
So itchy.

08:58.956 --> 09:01.757
Probably those fleece
pajamas I've been wearing.

09:01.759 --> 09:04.827
Tonight, I sleep on this mattress naked.

09:04.829 --> 09:06.562
Let me put it to you straight.

09:06.564 --> 09:11.233
Do you think the country
is becoming... feminized?

09:11.235 --> 09:13.902
I think that <i>is </i> you, Tuttle.

09:13.904 --> 09:16.304
But how? What did you figure out?

09:16.306 --> 09:19.241
Undoubtedly. The TV dial is overrun

09:19.243 --> 09:20.842
with the female agenda.

09:20.844 --> 09:23.379
And my new book, "I Loathe Lucy,"

09:23.381 --> 09:25.914
is about putting these
hysterical sapphos

09:25.916 --> 09:27.315
back in their box.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.117
A tremendous read.

09:29.119 --> 09:30.652
Shall we jazz?

09:30.654 --> 09:32.788
I thought you'd never ask.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.325
Welcome, nighthawks.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.728
We've been expecting you.

09:39.730 --> 09:42.731
The hour's late,
but the party is just getting started.

09:42.733 --> 09:45.734
Do you think the country
is becoming... feminized?

09:45.736 --> 09:47.335
Let me put it to you straight.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.237
Do you think the country is becoming...

09:49.339 --> 09:50.672
Do you think the country is becoming...

09:50.674 --> 09:54.009
Do you think the country
is becoming... feminized?

09:54.011 --> 09:55.511
Do you think the country is becoming...

09:55.613 --> 09:57.546
Do you think the country is becoming...

09:57.548 --> 09:59.815
Do you think the country
is becoming... feminized?

09:59.817 --> 10:02.818
- Undoubtedly. The TV dial is overrun...
- Look. It's Charlie.

10:02.820 --> 10:04.820
- ...with the female agenda.
- Welcome, nighthawks.

10:04.822 --> 10:07.089
And my new book, "I Loathe Lucy,"

10:07.091 --> 10:08.757
is about putting these
hysterical sapphos...

10:08.759 --> 10:10.492
- A tremendous read.
- ...back in their box.

10:10.494 --> 10:12.494
Shall we jazz?

10:20.238 --> 10:21.703
What are you doing, Mom?!

10:21.705 --> 10:23.505
We said we'd check on
him every 10 minutes!

10:23.507 --> 10:24.706
It's only been 3!

10:24.708 --> 10:26.242
Sleep training is cruel.

10:26.244 --> 10:27.589
I want to pick him up!

10:27.645 --> 10:29.511
You're both wrong. We need to give...

10:29.513 --> 10:32.248
- We're not giving him weed!
- It's a micro-dose

10:32.250 --> 10:33.644
to help him sleep.

10:33.984 --> 10:36.852
We need to get in there!
He's afraid of the dark!

10:36.854 --> 10:39.255
Oh. Leaving so soon?

10:39.257 --> 10:40.989
Well, our party keeps going.

10:40.991 --> 10:44.526
So, if it gets lonely out
there in the wee, small hours,

10:44.528 --> 10:46.528
remember, nighthawks,

10:46.530 --> 10:49.265
you always have a friend
here at the Hideaway.

10:52.069 --> 10:53.736
There must be something I missed.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.085
Hmm.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.620
Cannonball!

11:15.493 --> 11:18.026
Welcome, nighthawk.

11:18.028 --> 11:20.096
We've been expecting you.

11:20.098 --> 11:21.897
I'm in the TV!

11:21.899 --> 11:24.032
I'm so relieved I'm not crazy!

11:24.034 --> 11:26.702
It was just a magic TV, that's all.

11:26.704 --> 11:29.771
Yes, please.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.508
Charlie, play some
of those notes you know I like.

11:32.510 --> 11:35.243
What the hell is that floating light?

11:35.245 --> 11:37.245
Tuttle!

11:37.247 --> 11:39.114
Stan?

11:39.116 --> 11:40.649
I remember you.

11:40.651 --> 11:42.250
Of course. You remember me.
I'm... I'm like

11:42.252 --> 11:46.054
- your all-time favorite person.
- Oh, it's the rerunning.

11:46.056 --> 11:47.389
We just keep rerunning.

11:47.391 --> 11:48.790
I remember less each time.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.859
I'm forgetting my life, Sam!

11:50.861 --> 11:52.728
Tuttle, relax. You don't like it here,

11:52.730 --> 11:54.596
- let's just go.
- We can't.

11:54.598 --> 11:56.598
We're trapped here forever.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.335
Ooh. Does forever include this weekend?

11:59.337 --> 12:01.403
'Cause the BET Awards are on.

12:01.405 --> 12:03.138
BET Awards?

12:03.140 --> 12:04.673
I remember those.

12:04.675 --> 12:06.475
Those are from the future.

12:06.477 --> 12:07.876
I need to get back to the future.

12:08.525 --> 12:10.278
"Back to the Future"!

12:10.280 --> 12:12.080
I love that movie!

12:12.082 --> 12:13.415
And Michael J. Fox!

12:13.417 --> 12:14.750
He was so great!

12:14.752 --> 12:18.220
Then... that thing happened to him.

12:18.222 --> 12:20.022
Oh, then the Towers.

12:20.024 --> 12:22.758
Then that pretty good
Denis Leary firemen show.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.627
I need to get back to my time!

12:25.629 --> 12:28.163
It's not lighting up.
It's not lighting up!

12:28.165 --> 12:30.098
Oh, boy.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.234
He'll pay for that at commercial time.

12:32.236 --> 12:33.769
What happens at commercial?

12:33.771 --> 12:37.172
<i>And we're clear to commercial.</i>

12:38.143 --> 12:40.376
No! Please don't! Don't eat me!

12:40.378 --> 12:41.710
Yuh-oh.
- No!

12:41.712 --> 12:44.513
- No-o-o-o!!
- Oh, boy.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.643
Sounds bad.

12:46.050 --> 12:48.784
<i>We're on in 3, 2...</i>

12:51.321 --> 12:53.389
Oh, God. He's gone.

12:53.391 --> 12:55.591
It's a good thing I'm
clearly irreplaceable

12:55.593 --> 12:57.026
and integral to the show.

13:06.637 --> 13:10.639
Charlie, now how about
something a little harder?

13:10.641 --> 13:14.710
Here's a rowdy little number called
"Volcano Blast Freakout."

13:18.449 --> 13:20.449
Hot, hot, hot.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.918
Did you hear that guy say,
"Don't eat me"?

13:22.920 --> 13:24.986
That makes me think Alistair ate him.

13:24.988 --> 13:28.323
He doesn't like it when
people mess up his show.

13:28.325 --> 13:30.659
You having a nice time, Stan?

13:31.157 --> 13:33.128
You know my name. That's cool!

13:33.130 --> 13:34.529
Hey, what is this place?

13:34.531 --> 13:37.933
This is a party, baby,
and parties are fun.

13:37.935 --> 13:41.937
So when the camera's on,
you will make nice conversation,

13:41.939 --> 13:43.939
you will keep a drink in hand,

13:43.941 --> 13:46.876
and you will listen to and love

13:46.878 --> 13:50.412
every bit of jazz you hear.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.347
But I like swamp rock.

13:52.349 --> 13:54.283
- No.
- What if we want to leave?

13:54.285 --> 13:55.885
Leave? Why?

13:55.887 --> 13:57.486
You're with other nighthawks,

13:57.488 --> 14:00.722
solo creatures who
enjoy mature pleasures.

14:00.749 --> 14:02.224
Face it, Stan.

14:02.272 --> 14:04.560
- You're a sensualist.
- I know.

14:04.562 --> 14:06.095
But I have a family.

14:06.097 --> 14:07.897
Do you, now?

14:07.899 --> 14:09.030
Yeah, I do.

14:09.032 --> 14:11.767
It's just hard to remember their names.

14:11.769 --> 14:14.836
I told you. I told you.

14:14.838 --> 14:16.838
Francine, Hayley, Steve, Klaus,

14:16.840 --> 14:18.440
Roger. Good, good.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.175
Come on, Tuttle. We can't forget.

14:20.177 --> 14:22.644
I can't remember my family.

14:22.646 --> 14:24.513
- You don't have one.
- Oh.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.449
Don't worry. I still have <i>my</i> family.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.318
- _
- We got to get out of here.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.520
But how? You saw that guy.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.590
We can't call the elevator.

14:34.592 --> 14:36.992
Maybe we don't have to.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.400
- Welcome...
- Pardon. Pardon. Excuse me.

14:45.402 --> 14:47.669
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- I'm with him.

15:03.287 --> 15:05.454
I think we got away!

15:08.425 --> 15:11.160
- It's all fake!
- Let's try the soup.

15:11.162 --> 15:13.895
That's how you can tell
if it's a real diner.

15:13.897 --> 15:15.497
We're still on the show.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.634
Stan, look! The tree!

15:18.636 --> 15:21.436
Follow the color!

15:21.438 --> 15:22.638
This is the way home!

15:22.640 --> 15:26.375
Langley Falls, here we come!

15:26.377 --> 15:28.177
And maybe there was something appealing

15:28.179 --> 15:29.645
about that bachelor vibe.

15:29.647 --> 15:32.581
Because, boy,
the family was driving me nuts.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.583
You wouldn't know what that's like,
but trust me.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.252
I pretend my fingers are my family...

15:37.254 --> 15:39.254
Mama Thumb always nagging,

15:39.256 --> 15:41.857
Uncle Index with the corny jokes.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.325
What can I say?

15:43.327 --> 15:44.794
They're a handful!

15:45.875 --> 15:47.262
♪ I got Francine ♪

15:47.264 --> 15:48.730
♪ I got Steve ♪

15:48.732 --> 15:50.599
♪ Uh, I got Harley ♪

15:50.601 --> 15:52.934
♪ I got Clark, I want to say Bruce ♪

15:52.936 --> 15:55.937
- Take it, Tuttle!
- ♪ I got no one ♪

15:55.939 --> 15:57.339
Take it, Stan!

16:00.011 --> 16:02.277
Welp, see you around the neighborhood,
Tuttle, old boy.

16:02.279 --> 16:05.481
Yeah. I should get going, too.

16:05.483 --> 16:07.416
Oh, yeah. You have nobody.

16:07.418 --> 16:08.950
Turn off the car, you idiot.

16:08.952 --> 16:11.286
You're coming inside,
you big, fat idiot.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.621
You mean it?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.690
Yeah. You live with me now.

16:14.692 --> 16:16.625
I'll convert the shed
into a room for you.

16:16.627 --> 16:19.761
- I won't insulate it.
- Stan, I have a house.

16:19.763 --> 16:22.097
It's nothing. You'll sleep
on some old car batteries.

16:22.099 --> 16:23.565
I won't hear another word.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.634
Now come watch me hug my family.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.969
Beloved ones, I'm home!

16:30.307 --> 16:32.041
Welcome back, nighthawks.

16:32.043 --> 16:33.909
We've been expecting you.

16:38.782 --> 16:42.251
Oh, no. I'm gonna forget them forever.

17:05.742 --> 17:08.477
Have you heard the new hi-fi's
with the quadraphonic sound?

17:08.479 --> 17:11.413
They're really the best
for listening to jazz.

17:11.415 --> 17:14.616
It sounds like,
"Skeedle-dee-deep-do-bop-do-bop,

17:14.617 --> 17:18.954
scoop-doop, sly-gar,
flarga-marga, smee-boo."

17:18.955 --> 17:21.089
A man can't be himself in the kitchen.

17:21.092 --> 17:23.157
It's not his domain.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.429
But what about when <i>he</i> gets hungry,
and <i>she's</i> not there?

17:27.431 --> 17:30.699
Well, the space-age wet bar of tomorrow

17:30.701 --> 17:32.902
can satisfy his hunger.

17:32.904 --> 17:35.771
A Rumaki-Maker-Matic, folks.

17:35.773 --> 17:38.974
Just plug it in,
load the hopper with chicken liver,

17:38.976 --> 17:42.043
and within minutes,
nuclear-hot hors d'oeuvres

17:42.045 --> 17:43.378
plop out all over

17:43.380 --> 17:46.782
this green tray that
looks like a cabbage.

17:46.784 --> 17:49.318
- Ah!
- Ooh!

17:49.320 --> 17:51.320
Now, picture it. It's 11:15.

17:51.322 --> 17:52.988
You're at the Sands.

17:52.990 --> 17:56.725
Frank Sinatra's overflow girls
are starting to get hungry.

17:56.727 --> 17:59.328
They say they want melted
cheese and lots of it.

17:59.330 --> 18:02.063
Time for fondue.

18:02.065 --> 18:03.198
Fondue.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.866
With an electric fondue set,

18:04.868 --> 18:06.868
it's fast, it's easy and clean,

18:06.870 --> 18:09.004
and lets you eat more cheese

18:09.006 --> 18:11.473
more quickly than ever before.

18:11.475 --> 18:13.408
Fondue! Fondue.

18:13.410 --> 18:14.876
Electric fondue!

18:14.878 --> 18:17.012
Bingo-bango, hot cheese on tap!

18:17.014 --> 18:18.880
My wife! My wife, Fondue!

18:18.882 --> 18:20.682
No, Fondine. <i>Francine!</i>

18:20.684 --> 18:24.720
I remember Francine, and, oh,
how she loved her fondue!

18:24.722 --> 18:25.821
Tuttle! Wake up!

18:26.612 --> 18:27.756
Francine!

18:27.758 --> 18:29.090
Hayley! Steve!

18:29.092 --> 18:31.226
Klaus! Roger!

18:31.228 --> 18:32.894
I'm not a nighthawk!

18:32.896 --> 18:34.830
I want my family!

18:36.900 --> 18:39.034
We're going to take a commercial break,

18:39.036 --> 18:42.371
and when we return,
I promise the party will be...

18:42.373 --> 18:44.439
back on track.

18:44.441 --> 18:45.574
Stan, are you okay?

18:45.576 --> 18:48.177
You're wearing the wall like a hat.

18:48.179 --> 18:49.645
Whoa.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.916
I came in through the static.

18:54.947 --> 18:56.918
This is the way out!

18:59.457 --> 19:01.923
<i>And we're clear to commercial.</i>

19:25.349 --> 19:26.682
Let go of me, you monster!

19:26.684 --> 19:29.751
Ow! Stan, you're kicking my face!

19:33.643 --> 19:35.224
Oh! We're safe.

19:35.226 --> 19:36.291
He can't get past the...

19:46.770 --> 19:49.472
Look what I did!

19:50.908 --> 19:52.174
Where the hell have <i>you</i> been?

19:52.176 --> 19:53.575
I almost went down there.

19:53.577 --> 19:56.045
Family! Oh, sweet family!

19:56.047 --> 19:58.447
I want you to know that
I haven't forgotten you,

19:58.449 --> 19:59.915
even if I came close.

19:59.917 --> 20:03.919
I'm here now, and I want to do
what you want to do.

20:03.921 --> 20:06.655
I want to raise this child.

20:06.657 --> 20:08.799
- Daddy's here.
- I'm not doing that anymore.

20:08.892 --> 20:09.954
Thank God.

20:22.339 --> 20:23.672
Poor bastard.

20:23.674 --> 20:25.941
Feels good to have
things back to normal.

20:25.943 --> 20:27.542
- Stan?
- Whaddup?

20:27.544 --> 20:32.281
Have you heard the new hi-fi's
with quadraphonic sound?

20:32.283 --> 20:34.083
They're the best hi-fi's for...

20:34.085 --> 20:36.351
- Ja-a-a-zz.
- Ja-a-a-zz.

20:36.353 --> 20:39.020
No. No! No!

20:39.022 --> 20:40.890
No-o-o-o!

20:40.892 --> 20:43.759
<i>That's right! "American Dad!"
is now a show that exists</i>

20:43.761 --> 20:49.164
<i>on TV in the basement of the family of
"American Dad!"</i>

20:49.166 --> 20:50.900
Another great episode.

20:50.902 --> 20:53.702
So long, nighthawks.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.374
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
