02:22.842 --> 02:27.837
THE DEATH OF LOUIS XIV

03:10.089 --> 03:11.182
Sire,

03:11.324 --> 03:13.919
shall we join our guests?

03:17.564 --> 03:20.329
I'd love to, but I cannot.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.561
Oh, my dogs...

03:50.730 --> 03:53.097
My beloved dogs.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.877
It's been 20 days since you saw them.

04:27.066 --> 04:28.125
Yes.

04:28.234 --> 04:29.827
Oh, yes...

04:52.725 --> 04:54.193
My dogs...

04:58.031 --> 04:59.363
My dogs

05:00.800 --> 05:02.098
love me.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.303
Yes, Sire,

05:04.604 --> 05:06.368
you are their master.

05:07.974 --> 05:12.036
It's a pity that Dr. Fagon stops me
from seeing them more often.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.679
My dogs...

05:15.882 --> 05:18.215
My dogs that I love so much.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.556
They are splendid.

05:40.473 --> 05:41.600
Sire,

05:41.941 --> 05:44.467
the dogs will return for the night.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.252
Sire?

06:32.959 --> 06:36.259
Would you do us the honour of coming with us?

06:36.362 --> 06:37.830
Please, Sire.

06:37.964 --> 06:40.195
No no, I'd prefer to go to bed.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.359
It would make us so happy.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.864
Then I will salute those who want to see me.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.306
Sire.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.135
Bring me the hat.

06:56.215 --> 06:57.581
Very well, Sire.

07:25.845 --> 07:28.212
Thank you, Sire, bravo.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.210
Blouin.

07:32.351 --> 07:33.410
Sire?

07:33.686 --> 07:35.416
Take the hat away.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.545
Perhaps...

08:03.149 --> 08:05.277
We can try that.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.253
Look at me, Sire.

08:32.611 --> 08:33.602
Yes, good.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.375
Let's try this one.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.543
Donkey milk is the correct remedy.

09:19.825 --> 09:24.092
Your Majesty, we agree.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.477
Fagon?

09:44.584 --> 09:45.677
Your Majesty.

09:45.818 --> 09:49.311
Have you examined the Marchesa of Cujas?

09:50.256 --> 09:51.849
Yes, Majesty.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.818
It was something I...

09:54.961 --> 09:57.692
Was she beautiful naked?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.227
Beautiful indeed, Majesty.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.194
I think nature was very generous.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.295
To her!

10:09.375 --> 10:11.241
To her, yes.

10:13.913 --> 10:18.214
Fagon keeps us informed about "everything".

10:20.119 --> 10:22.714
You mean to speak of Mr. Blouin

10:23.255 --> 10:25.622
who has ears and eyes...

10:26.559 --> 10:30.223
all along the palace corridors.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.729
I agree.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.201
It's not the least of his qualities.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.294
Thank you, doctor.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.108
It's true that...

10:44.610 --> 10:46.806
the Marchesa of Saxony...

10:47.380 --> 10:50.043
if you don't mind me saying, Sire...

10:50.883 --> 10:53.944
is very beautiful.

10:55.254 --> 11:00.022
She's a little more discrete
than the Marchesa of Cujas.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.820
Marchesa of Cujas is not...

11:05.765 --> 11:07.597
How can I say?

11:08.167 --> 11:11.296
Being evidently respectful,

11:11.971 --> 11:14.167
she is not very shy.

11:15.808 --> 11:20.075
The Marchesa of Saxony
is a little more difficult.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.871
But...

11:24.250 --> 11:27.482
If you allow me again, Sire, these are...

11:27.620 --> 11:32.251
Delightful gardens to play in, Majesty.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.995
Sirs, you may take your leave.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.120
Very well.

11:45.938 --> 11:48.931
Sire, your health is good.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.144
The ladies will be delighted

11:54.280 --> 11:56.306
about your return, Majesty.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.853
He seems much better.

12:09.295 --> 12:11.787
Here are the eggs for your dinner.

12:30.216 --> 12:31.479
Go ahead.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.516
Bravo, Sire.

13:16.462 --> 13:19.432
Would you like some biscotin?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.212
Very well.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.646
Yes.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.962
It's wonderful, Sire...

14:30.102 --> 14:32.833
to see you have your appetite back.

14:32.972 --> 14:36.773
And that you will soon gain strength.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.240
Believe me, this news...

14:40.346 --> 14:42.440
will be received with great joy

14:42.548 --> 14:45.347
both within the Kingdom and abroad.

14:46.952 --> 14:50.184
Oh, yes, Sire, with great joy.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.457
Bravo, Sire.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.352
Look, Sire.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.146
We made a bigger one here...

15:28.527 --> 15:30.155
I asked the Duke of York,

15:30.296 --> 15:33.289
an expert on coastal defences.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.336
He'll explain better than me.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.905
The bridge in La Roche...

15:40.039 --> 15:43.567
The bridge itself is very big

15:43.709 --> 15:45.803
but the entrance is small.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.711
It's a lot easier to protect the bridge

15:49.848 --> 15:53.717
if we make a fortress on both sides of it.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.549
We need to strengthen...

15:57.323 --> 15:58.444
the soil.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.962
But I'll use a new stone from the Nile.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.194
We need the money
in advance for the transport

16:08.334 --> 16:10.565
to reduce expenses.

16:11.303 --> 16:15.240
And that is very important to earn the trust

16:15.908 --> 16:17.069
of the people...

16:17.209 --> 16:21.237
And also the people we're buying from.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.541
It is very important to have your approval...

16:24.650 --> 16:27.119
for the advance payment,

16:27.753 --> 16:29.119
so we can begin.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.987
You see how well the Duke of York worked.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.786
Yes, there's work to do.

16:40.699 --> 16:42.895
Is it really necessary?

16:43.235 --> 16:44.362
Yes, Sire.

16:45.504 --> 16:48.736
The Duke of York found different cheap stones

16:48.874 --> 16:50.308
from the Nile.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.271
They are more resistant.

16:52.511 --> 16:57.176
Only the transport is more expensive,
which is why we need more money.

16:57.483 --> 17:00.476
I'll think about it, thank you.

17:02.321 --> 17:03.311
Very well.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.614
Lords...

17:07.626 --> 17:11.494
Please excuse me but I really
have to speak with His Majesty.

17:14.599 --> 17:15.693
Sire.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.651
Your Majesty appears to be most discomforted.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.428
Probably because of the horrible night.

17:46.365 --> 17:49.130
You didn't touch your dessert, Sire.

20:05.971 --> 20:07.166
Water.

20:08.073 --> 20:09.632
Water!

20:12.377 --> 20:14.243
My valet, my valet!

20:17.115 --> 20:18.481
Water!

20:22.688 --> 20:24.122
My valet!

20:35.167 --> 20:36.294
Sire,

20:36.602 --> 20:38.366
what would you like?

20:39.605 --> 20:42.473
You aren't my valet, I want water!

21:00.292 --> 21:01.282
Water!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.121
Sire...

21:09.201 --> 21:11.170
Not in that glass...

21:11.270 --> 21:12.898
In a crystal glass.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.734
In a crystal glass!

21:16.942 --> 21:19.207
No, in a crystal glass!

21:20.912 --> 21:23.541
Water! Quickly! Water!

21:24.883 --> 21:26.044
Water!

21:50.175 --> 21:51.666
Clemence!

21:52.110 --> 21:53.908
Clemence, my valet!

21:54.980 --> 21:56.414
My valet.

22:08.393 --> 22:12.330
No, no, no, not you. Clemence!

22:13.465 --> 22:14.728
Clemence!

22:36.021 --> 22:37.489
Leave me alone!

23:01.747 --> 23:04.615
I had a horrible night.

23:05.250 --> 23:08.778
I had horrible pains in my left leg.

23:09.654 --> 23:12.749
I don't know if I can stay upright in Mass.

23:17.462 --> 23:19.454
Pardon me, Majesty, but...

23:22.467 --> 23:23.662
Are you...

23:24.169 --> 23:27.970
sure it's your leg hurting?
Are you sure it's not...

23:28.206 --> 23:29.606
below the kidney?

23:34.780 --> 23:35.975
Well.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.413
In any case, it's better, Sire,

23:42.487 --> 23:45.218
if you hear Mass from your bed this morning.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.986
No, no, I prefer to go to the chapel.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.484
Of course, Your Majesty.

23:52.564 --> 23:53.657
Apologies.

23:53.999 --> 23:54.989
Sire.

24:07.012 --> 24:08.571
Allow us, Majesty.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.252
Carefully, Majesty.

24:45.851 --> 24:49.083
Let me know when you've decided to treat me.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.254
Yes, Sire.

25:04.369 --> 25:06.099
May I, Majesty?

25:43.942 --> 25:45.433
Majesty, could I?

26:04.062 --> 26:06.429
Escort the King to the chapel.

26:15.874 --> 26:18.969
It would have been better
if His Majesty rested.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.670
All this rabbit...

26:22.314 --> 26:24.044
this feeding,

26:24.849 --> 26:27.080
overripe fruit,

26:28.219 --> 26:29.653
meat,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.225
these excesses of sugar,

26:35.193 --> 26:38.163
they are not good for his health.

26:38.363 --> 26:41.162
All these melons,
these blackberries, these figs,

26:43.101 --> 26:45.002
all with cold ice.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.570
Ice preserves.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.507
It's a conservation method.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.907
Which has existed for a long time.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.880
It's proven to work.

26:59.751 --> 27:00.912
But...

27:03.722 --> 27:05.213
Your comments

27:06.224 --> 27:09.592
make me wonder.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.231
I think about

27:13.865 --> 27:17.267
the King's diet a lot.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.235
"Maybe" you should think

27:20.505 --> 27:22.303
more seriously.

27:23.108 --> 27:25.630
I don't have to justify myself to you

27:25.710 --> 27:27.975
or any other valet.

27:29.314 --> 27:30.509
Perhaps...

27:31.716 --> 27:33.378
In fact,

27:36.254 --> 27:38.655
something different more often,

27:39.724 --> 27:41.022
every day...

27:43.061 --> 27:45.257
It would be better.

27:47.532 --> 27:51.401
We don't lack fruit
or vegetables in our gardens.

27:53.938 --> 27:55.270
May I?

28:12.457 --> 28:14.085
This grape is exquisite.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.432
What about

28:22.667 --> 28:25.068
Blouin's suggestion?

28:26.204 --> 28:28.696
To bring doctors in from the university?

28:30.208 --> 28:32.677
I don't approve it.

28:32.811 --> 28:33.835
Why?

28:35.814 --> 28:38.340
These men...

28:40.085 --> 28:43.715
Are doctors in classrooms.

28:47.158 --> 28:49.093
They look after books.

28:49.894 --> 28:51.453
And an audience.

28:52.964 --> 28:56.628
I've rarely seen them care for the sick.

28:57.469 --> 28:58.596
Mr. Fagon.

28:59.838 --> 29:02.967
These are doctors from the Sorbonne.

29:05.777 --> 29:10.044
It has a great reputation, as you know.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.812
I think that the reputation
of the doctors of the Faculty,

29:17.622 --> 29:19.352
Mr. de Molière

29:20.825 --> 29:23.226
has described it perfectly.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.995
They are even more dangerous

29:28.199 --> 29:29.497
as a group.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.467
Mr. Fagon.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.829
I don't think now is the time

29:35.940 --> 29:38.068
to search for Molière...

29:41.913 --> 29:44.712
What I wish for is answers.

29:46.050 --> 29:50.920
You know as well as me
that medicine is not an exact science

29:51.055 --> 29:54.457
that gives you answers as you please.

29:58.163 --> 30:01.600
But, this business of feeding

30:02.700 --> 30:04.931
is a lead to follow.

30:06.037 --> 30:07.938
I will see to this.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.557
Please, excuse me, Sire.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.896
You need to get up to stretch your limbs.

31:00.992 --> 31:02.460
Careful, Sire.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.354
Take your time.

31:10.101 --> 31:11.194
No?

31:12.937 --> 31:14.633
Let's not push.

31:23.014 --> 31:25.506
Sit and rest like this for a moment, Sire.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.310
Very well.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.703
Excuse us, Sire,

31:51.175 --> 31:54.475
I wanted to talk with...

31:54.579 --> 31:57.071
Mr. Blouin and Mr. Marechal.

32:07.325 --> 32:11.820
There is an important meeting
at 4pm with the ministers.

32:13.531 --> 32:16.023
It must be cancelled.

32:16.801 --> 32:20.829
His Majesty wants to be there, as you know.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.504
Of course,

32:22.707 --> 32:26.701
but his health is more important.

32:28.713 --> 32:31.012
I will try to change his mind.

32:31.115 --> 32:32.310
Go and tell him.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.113
It's beyond my control.

32:40.358 --> 32:41.690
Sire.

32:41.826 --> 32:45.024
The doctors want the meeting
at 4pm to be cancelled.

32:45.129 --> 32:48.258
And that we tell this to Mr. Pelletier.

32:50.601 --> 32:52.866
Please, excuse me, Sire.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.837
But I think you should stay in bed.

33:06.351 --> 33:09.719
I will bandage Your Majesty's leg.

33:15.259 --> 33:18.252
- You need bandages.
- And ointment, Mr. Blouin.

33:50.661 --> 33:51.993
Your Majesty.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.199
That's a relief!

34:01.773 --> 34:03.639
I'm so glad, Your Majesty.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.768
Put it everywhere, it's important.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.984
A little more, Majesty.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.469
Lift your leg a little, Majesty.

34:41.212 --> 34:43.511
Can you hold it like that, Blouin?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.081
Thank you.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.225
Wait a little longer, Majesty.

35:06.471 --> 35:10.169
Mr. Marechal has nearly finished
bandaging your leg.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.984
It's finished, Majesty.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.422
Careful.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.555
Fagon, help us.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.699
Cover it.

35:43.107 --> 35:46.100
Perfect. Now you can rest, Sire.

35:54.752 --> 35:55.947
Your Majesty.

36:21.279 --> 36:22.333
Sire?

36:22.413 --> 36:25.679
Are you sure you want
to meet the ministers now?

36:26.684 --> 36:29.279
I have to go to the Council of Ministers.

36:31.422 --> 36:33.084
All that can wait.

36:35.660 --> 36:36.992
It's my duty.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.660
We can do that later...

36:39.797 --> 36:41.789
My leg isn't hurting me anymore.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.663
Bring me my wheelchair.

36:43.801 --> 36:45.793
It's intelligence that counts!

36:48.940 --> 36:51.375
Bring me my wheelchair, please.

36:51.509 --> 36:52.636
Valet!

37:06.357 --> 37:07.791
More water.

37:10.461 --> 37:14.364
I must tell you, Sire.
You are misusing your strength.

37:24.208 --> 37:27.736
It would be preferable
you would lie and rest.

38:00.645 --> 38:03.774
You should take me back to bed.

39:10.314 --> 39:11.646
Mr. Fagon?

39:18.089 --> 39:19.648
Don't you think...

39:20.291 --> 39:22.283
the bird's presence

39:22.593 --> 39:25.119
is hindering the King's convalescence?

39:30.835 --> 39:31.825
No.

39:33.637 --> 39:36.232
I don't see how the bird

39:37.641 --> 39:40.304
would stop the King from getting better.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.873
My mother

39:45.850 --> 39:47.478
always told me

39:51.822 --> 39:54.314
that birds carry disease.

39:58.763 --> 40:02.393
This bird is in a cage.
It has no contact with the King.

40:05.002 --> 40:08.131
Sickness can cross bars, Mr. Fagon.

40:10.908 --> 40:14.845
Obviously you are
a great scholar in Medicine.

40:18.215 --> 40:20.207
I remind you that earlier...

40:20.885 --> 40:22.581
you insisted that

40:25.723 --> 40:30.320
His Majesty's dogs could enter his room.

40:31.662 --> 40:33.824
And now...

40:36.000 --> 40:39.402
you want to take away a little bird.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.603
Your logic escapes me, Mr. Blouin.

40:45.910 --> 40:48.379
I'm just a little worried.

40:48.546 --> 40:50.845
We all are, Mr. Blouin.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.745
But at the moment you will allow

40:56.120 --> 40:59.522
to make it so that things stay as they are.

41:03.828 --> 41:05.023
Mr. Fagon?

41:06.263 --> 41:09.256
Mr. Blouin, you're having
trouble falling asleep?

41:10.401 --> 41:12.836
Have you heard about

41:13.704 --> 41:15.639
a Dr. Lebrun?

41:17.741 --> 41:19.209
Dr. Lebrun?

41:21.612 --> 41:23.581
The one from Marseilles?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.917
He's from Marseilles, yes.

41:27.418 --> 41:31.617
I've heard about a Dr. Lebrun
of Marseilles from some...

41:32.857 --> 41:34.223
friends.

41:35.426 --> 41:36.792
Doctor friends.

41:40.798 --> 41:43.267
But that's all I know.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.768
Why are you talking about this Dr. Lebrun?

41:47.304 --> 41:49.296
He was introduced to the court.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.908
I know nothing about him.

41:54.245 --> 41:56.646
We haven't even invited
the Sorbonne doctors yet,

41:56.780 --> 41:59.875
and a doctor from Marseilles
is already coming?

42:00.985 --> 42:03.352
It seems he has magic remedies.

42:03.487 --> 42:06.821
And also very controversial,
if I believe my friends.

42:11.195 --> 42:15.189
I'm just amazed that you can have faith

42:17.001 --> 42:19.436
in such old-fashioned beliefs.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.194
That's all.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.734
They are not beliefs.

42:25.009 --> 42:27.410
And certainly not superstitions
from the Middle Ages.

42:27.945 --> 42:33.077
Believe those who know medicine.

42:34.318 --> 42:36.753
I won't question your habits,

42:37.354 --> 42:39.585
your dispositions.

42:40.457 --> 42:43.894
Please don't mistrust my prerogatives.

42:46.597 --> 42:48.088
Water!

42:56.874 --> 42:57.864
Please!

42:58.542 --> 43:00.602
Water! Water!

43:26.003 --> 43:27.266
Water...

43:34.144 --> 43:36.010
Mr. Blouin, I already told you

43:36.146 --> 43:38.479
not to give in to all his whims.

43:39.149 --> 43:42.119
Leave the King alone please.

44:07.945 --> 44:10.346
You won't lose your leg, Majesty.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.645
I've seen many cases with such marks.

44:14.785 --> 44:18.222
- None of them were gangrene.
- It's true.

44:21.158 --> 44:24.822
This mark will disappear quickly.

44:49.253 --> 44:51.245
Thank you, Marechal.

44:53.824 --> 44:56.350
The pain has gone.

45:16.346 --> 45:17.609
Sire?

45:19.116 --> 45:22.245
The doctors from the Sorbonne are here.

46:05.829 --> 46:08.594
His Majesty seems to be suffering from fever.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.539
Majesty, please allow me to open your mouth.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.275
The tongue, Sire!

46:35.092 --> 46:38.756
His mouth is unusually dry.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.160
Bring him pure water.

46:54.611 --> 46:56.011
Drink this, Sire.

47:41.225 --> 47:43.717
These marks are worrisome.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.994
Worrisome, worrisome.

48:39.383 --> 48:41.716
We'll do everything we can, Sire.

48:53.230 --> 48:56.723
He should probably be bled.

48:58.402 --> 49:00.496
Even if he doesn't like it.

49:00.637 --> 49:02.799
It will make his head spin.

49:12.649 --> 49:15.847
I think we should let His Majesty sleep.

50:16.346 --> 50:20.181
Are those the drums
and the oboes of Saint-Louis' day?

50:22.886 --> 50:24.184
Yes, Sire!

51:51.942 --> 51:54.104
Here's your dinner, Sire.

52:02.953 --> 52:05.582
I can't swallow anymore.

52:06.389 --> 52:07.823
Everything revolts me.

52:12.162 --> 52:15.155
Would you like some broth?

52:20.170 --> 52:22.662
Perhaps a little,

52:23.974 --> 52:25.636
but properly strained.

52:26.610 --> 52:28.909
I can't swallow anything.

52:29.613 --> 52:31.081
Very well, Sire.

53:07.083 --> 53:09.848
I can't swallow anything.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.225
Everything disgusts me.

53:30.207 --> 53:32.176
- Blouin?
- Yes, Madame?

53:32.876 --> 53:34.868
The Italian musicians,

53:35.011 --> 53:38.038
who'll play at the grand dinner...

53:39.482 --> 53:41.212
The King is here.

53:41.851 --> 53:44.047
Can we ask them to his room?

53:44.187 --> 53:45.553
Of course, Madame.

53:51.261 --> 53:53.196
This leg!

53:57.234 --> 53:58.759
It stinks!

53:59.102 --> 54:01.003
I want to vomit!

54:02.005 --> 54:03.769
I feel nauseated.

54:17.020 --> 54:18.454
My child...

54:21.291 --> 54:23.590
You will be a great king.

54:25.662 --> 54:29.292
Don't imitate me in what concerns
the love for the buildings.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.770
Nor the love I had for the war.

54:35.038 --> 54:36.438
Instead,

54:38.141 --> 54:40.804
make peace with your neighbours.

54:42.279 --> 54:45.408
Give back to God what you owe Him.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.976
Make your people devoted to Him.

54:51.821 --> 54:54.290
Try to console them.

55:38.468 --> 55:39.663
Sire?

55:50.146 --> 55:52.047
Go and fetch Marechal.

56:17.674 --> 56:19.768
Fagon, help me to lift the leg.

56:20.744 --> 56:21.837
Gently.

56:55.278 --> 56:57.611
Breathe, Sire, breathe.

57:03.052 --> 57:04.384
Gangrene...

57:05.088 --> 57:06.249
Cut it off!

57:06.389 --> 57:09.723
Sire, do not be afflicted
of a vain mutilation.

57:13.196 --> 57:15.597
Would you like to drink a bit, Majesty?

57:15.932 --> 57:18.834
You must think of something quickly.

57:21.204 --> 57:23.435
We can't let him suffer like this.

57:23.773 --> 57:25.605
Nothing can be done.

57:29.979 --> 57:31.470
Have you told Father Le Tellier?

57:31.614 --> 57:32.843
Of course.

57:36.319 --> 57:38.015
Stay calm, Majesty.

58:22.532 --> 58:25.764
Do you want to confess, Sire?

58:29.339 --> 58:30.807
Talk to me.

58:39.649 --> 58:41.675
God forgive me...

58:42.252 --> 58:43.242
Bless me...

58:43.820 --> 58:45.288
God forgive me...

58:48.291 --> 58:49.657
Bless me.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.472
The Duke of Orleans told me to come.

59:45.415 --> 59:48.442
You should know I think
you are just a charlatan.

59:48.651 --> 59:50.483
I came to save the King.

59:51.187 --> 59:55.648
I was coming from Marseilles
and while arriving in Paris,

59:55.825 --> 59:58.624
I heard about the King's disease.

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:04.290
I have the elixir to save him.

01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:07.734
What is it made of?

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.999
It has bull's sperm

01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:14.839
and bull's blood

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.142
and frog fat.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.910
But we didn't put, this time for the King,

01:00:23.019 --> 01:00:27.081
brain's juice that the English distil.

01:00:30.793 --> 01:00:33.262
Trust me.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:39.933
Perhaps you could demonstrate,

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.702
before giving His Majesty the elixir.

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:45.934
Give him water.

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:16.999
To Life

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.502
or to Death.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.829
It will save the King.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.069
Who are your teachers?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.008
Give him Alicante wine.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.201
May I?

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:57.978
You haven't replied to my question.
Sir, I would like to know

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.279
your masters in the matter of Medicine.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:05.513
Who taught you what you know?

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.295
Give the wine!

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:39.105
Do you want to try again?

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.655
It doesn't have any effect.

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:55.358
His Majesty has refused the elixir.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:57.364
Yes, His Majesty

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:01.163
is getting better.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:07.343
His gaze is arrested.

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:18.044
He already has...

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.289
the sunrise...

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.352
the dawn...

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.359
the beauty...

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.922
and the youth...

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:13.968
Perhaps a bit more elixir?

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:15.536
Yes.

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.045
We shouldn't lose hope.

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:21.581
Go...

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:25.247
and get wine and the elixir.

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:32.690
Perhaps we are on the right track.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:35.829
His expression is more livelier.

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.101
And the wine?

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:18.099
I don't really understand

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:21.372
your position on this.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.636
The depths of the earth...

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.542
We deal with the physical.

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.182
With the bodies of men.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.786
Their guts, like my colleague said.

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:36.518
Yes, but your feet are on the ground.

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.495
And from the ground

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:42.031
will grow

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:43.931
the trees,

01:06:44.033 --> 01:06:45.695
and plants,

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:48.532
that bloom, and we pick them,

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.567
and they come directly
from the depths of earth.

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:55.170
So, there must be a communion.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.037
After all, that is what you preach.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.081
A communion between

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:03.015
the earth and the body.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.916
It's all quite hazy...

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:11.959
Who cured the King from smallpox?

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:15.095
Was it an elixir?

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:18.497
No, it was the doctors,
it was our knowledge, very simply.

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:22.928
The King has had diseases
his whole life, and every time...

01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.404
He recovered.

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:26.599
Thanks to who?

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:29.545
The Faculty and our skills.

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:32.575
Of instruments. What do you work with?

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:35.614
Smallpox is like roses,

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:38.812
when they blossom in spring they are happy.

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:41.049
It's not a rose, sir!

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.955
During winter they're sad...

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:48.728
You seem to consider disease
to be a sublimation...

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.627
of the body?

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:53.463
Like you have to bear it

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.594
to go higher...

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:00.066
We're no longer in the times
of Valois, when one had to suffer...

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:03.444
to meet our Lord.

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.241
But what is love?

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:09.885
Love is pain.

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.954
Like Arnau de Vilanova explained

01:08:15.091 --> 01:08:18.720
in his unquestionable book

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.432
"On the Physiology of Love",

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:26.935
love manifests itself because
the picture of the beloved

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:30.005
remains blocked between the eyes.

01:08:30.305 --> 01:08:33.242
The picture remains blocked between the eyes,

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:36.868
due to the temperature of the body,

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.779
waters in the brain evaporate

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:43.647
and the brain remains dry.

01:08:46.154 --> 01:08:48.818
So let's trepan, if the brain is dry...

01:08:50.658 --> 01:08:51.921
We make an incision,

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:55.828
take out the liquids,
put everything back in motion

01:08:56.298 --> 01:09:00.133
by mechanical means, sir.

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:01.430
Tools.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:04.902
Right, because, sir... bears, stars,

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.470
everything you mentioned.

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:10.609
The smallpox, the roses...

01:09:11.514 --> 01:09:13.448
That's not enough anymore.

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.179
You're an impostor.

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.180
I'm starting to think the same.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.796
Have you reflected, Sire,
about the works of the Duke of York?

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:37.500
The fortresses in the West?

01:09:42.310 --> 01:09:45.076
We can trust him,
he's a friend of the Kingdom.

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.045
Our engineers examined his plans.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.810
They are outstanding.

01:09:55.758 --> 01:09:58.387
But the funds have not been freed up.

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.522
We need more money.

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:20.611
Here is your soup, Sire.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.624
You must eat, Sire.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:06.457
You asked for the Cardinal of Rohan.

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.030
Sire.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.240
Monsignor,

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.844
I am glad to see you.

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.109
I had a sort of dizzy spell.

01:11:31.487 --> 01:11:33.956
And I thought I was going to die.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:37.491
I know it's not good to die,

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:40.455
without the sacraments of the Church.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.265
But my hour has not come.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.058
I thank you for coming.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.069
Excuse me, Monsignor.

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:57.139
Sire.

01:12:04.119 --> 01:12:08.523
You've made the right decision.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:13.793
It's not time for the last rites.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.156
Sire.

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.354
Sire...

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:47.156
Which coffer?

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:50.324
The coffer...

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.637
That of my father the King.

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:59.201
And the black one.

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:07.572
The gold coffer and his father's one.

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.676
I think his father's one first.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:16.090
His father's one and the gold one.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:26.491
Here, Sire.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.077
The last one, Sire.

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:01.621
Thank you, Chancellor.

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:42.097
I'm sorry, Majesty,

01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:44.630
but I just burnt my fingers.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.119
Father Le Tellier, Sire.

01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:22.899
Sire,

01:17:23.338 --> 01:17:25.136
you called for me.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.942
Do you have news
from the Cardinal of Noailles?

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:34.848
No, Sire.

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:38.809
But I am sure he will answer your invite

01:17:38.954 --> 01:17:41.480
and he will come by your side

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.159
sooner than scheduled.

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.356
He didn't reply to the letter?

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:50.693
He hasn't replied to the letter yet.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:52.362
Won't he come?

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.570
I think he'll come.

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.796
Perhaps we need to wait a bit.

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.006
But I think he will come.

01:18:06.848 --> 01:18:08.043
And you, Blouin?

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:11.349
Have you heard something?

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:16.857
You know it's a delicate question.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.892
But if you wish,

01:18:20.395 --> 01:18:23.854
I can obtain more information.

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:48.547
The blood of Christ...

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:18.278
Father, please receive the body of Christ.

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:33.125
Mr. Blouin,

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.329
please receive the body of Christ.

01:20:12.374 --> 01:20:13.637
Majesty.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:34.220
Sire.

01:20:34.529 --> 01:20:35.861
Biscotin.

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:41.026
And wine from Alicante.

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.893
Where is Madame de Maintenon?

01:24:29.964 --> 01:24:33.867
Sire, she went to get the girls

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:36.700
at the Saint-Cyr boarding school,

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:39.433
whose care she is in charge of

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:43.203
and whom she's greatly attached to.

01:24:44.946 --> 01:24:46.744
Bring her here.

01:25:13.741 --> 01:25:15.107
Sire.

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.412
When I die,

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:30.991
you will send my heart

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:36.189
to the professed house of the Jesuits.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:42.296
And I shall get it mummified,

01:25:43.505 --> 01:25:47.340
like my late father, the King.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.247
I'll do what you say, Sire.

01:26:32.587 --> 01:26:34.385
I would like

01:26:41.763 --> 01:26:43.391
a hot/-cold

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.065
pot of poultry.

01:26:58.213 --> 01:27:00.739
The choice of a hot-/cold pot of poultry

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.748
may seem strange, but

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.747
it's good news.

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:08.049
He's getting his strength back.

01:27:12.727 --> 01:27:15.128
If that's what he desires.

01:28:16.991 --> 01:28:20.120
If the leg had gone,

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:25.493
the rest of the body would no longer depart.

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:51.279
It was the best solution,
his leg should have been cut off.

01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:53.919
Indeed. It would have made things easier.

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:09.491
Fagon,

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:15.302
the leg is lost.

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:29.146
I think we are at the point of no return.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:35.848
Sire?

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:41.052
The doctors want to speak to you.

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.808
I'm sorry to trouble your rest,

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:04.550
but we have an important request.

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.591
We noticed

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:19.831
that...

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.201
Mr. Lebrun's remedy

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:27.866
was far from helping His Majesty

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:32.740
and seems to have worsened his situation.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.013
Sire?

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.116
We must arrest him.

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:48.757
Your Majesty

01:32:49.463 --> 01:32:52.956
has shown again exceptional justice.

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:57.703
This was in fact the purpose
of our initiative,

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:00.204
from Mr. Marechal and myself.

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:07.646
We want these...

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:10.950
nasty characters,

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:14.581
to be stripped of their power to harm.

01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:18.225
We hope...

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:20.121
that...

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:24.061
they will be arrested

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.128
and sent to the Bastille.

01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:30.128
He's an impostor.

01:33:30.504 --> 01:33:31.995
Exactly, Sire.

01:33:32.673 --> 01:33:33.928
Very dangerous, Sire.

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:36.170
We must arrest him.

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:44.076
We thank His Majesty

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.819
for accepting our request.

01:34:01.402 --> 01:34:03.633
Allow us to withdraw,

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.838
so that you may...

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:11.009
sleep.

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:47.135
Sire.

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:49.938
Through this holy unction,

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:52.876
and His most tender mercy,

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:56.076
may the Lord forgive

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:58.084
your sins.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:06.558
Sins of the eyes.

01:36:13.134 --> 01:36:16.662
Sins of the mouth and the word.

01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:24.611
Sins of the ears.

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:35.855
Sins of taste and mouth.

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:40.621
Sins

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:43.054
of touch.

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:47.995
Your hand, Sire.

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:14.621
Go in peace, Sire.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:19.664
Please stay with the King,

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.200
watch over him.

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:44.543
At least drink a little water, Sire.

01:38:48.622 --> 01:38:49.817
Pure water.

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:17.014
Pardon me, Sire.

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:22.756
Nothing will help.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:33.097
We haven't tried the jelly yet.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:43.107
It all seems so ludicrous.

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:52.809
Sire.

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:57.889
Delicious jelly prepared by your cooks.

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:16.799
No.

01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:22.213
Excuse me, Sire.

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:30.191
Let's stop there, Fagon.

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:45.935
Perhaps later...

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.331
Pardon me, Sire.

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:22.336
You must eat something.

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:25.405
Just a little bit.

01:41:41.095 --> 01:41:42.461
Thank you, sir.

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:55.938
Your Majesty.

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:22.525
Fruit, perhaps.

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:03.935
Your Majesty.

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:12.516
Please, Sire.

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:38.442
A bit early.

01:43:45.886 --> 01:43:47.218
Your Majesty.

01:43:49.523 --> 01:43:52.493
Please, open your mouth a little.

01:44:06.273 --> 01:44:09.266
I'm sorry for insisting, Your Majesty.

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.256
Majesty.

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:48.548
I'm sorry, Majesty,

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:54.788
I was unable to prevent the sickness.

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:59.273
The King is dead.

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:02.613
It's noted, Mr. Fagon.

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:04.644
Write it down.

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:13.202
Go ahead, sirs.

01:49:43.343 --> 01:49:45.073
It's a good size...

01:49:49.883 --> 01:49:53.752
It's the double of a normal one.

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:06.762
Here is the spleen.

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.602
Here...

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:41.123
An inflammation.

01:50:41.267 --> 01:50:42.462
We can tell.

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:52.912
So you see that the stomach
was also affected by the gangrene.

01:50:53.013 --> 01:50:54.003
Indeed, sir.

01:50:56.049 --> 01:50:58.177
I shouldn't have listened

01:50:58.418 --> 01:51:00.785
to the birds of ill omen.

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:15.862
I suppose because of the sweat.

01:51:18.438 --> 01:51:19.497
Sweat?

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:20.937
Sweat.

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.373
He sweated too much.

01:51:35.722 --> 01:51:37.884
What is the cause of the gangrene?

01:51:53.006 --> 01:51:54.474
I don't know.

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.575
You don't know?

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:16.928
We have to open to see the brain.

01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:19.365
We'll do that later.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.297
I admit, I didn't believe it was gangrene.

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:26.896
That is my fault.

01:52:29.375 --> 01:52:31.776
You did what you could, Fagon.

01:52:34.447 --> 01:52:35.710
Of course.

01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:52.289
Gentlemen, we'll do better next time.
