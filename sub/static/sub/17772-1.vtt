03:31.600 --> 03:33.807
Are you following me?

03:35.360 --> 03:37.966
Um... no.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.480
Um, what are you doing?

03:59.560 --> 04:01.920
I live here.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.080
No. I live here.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.243
No. 3715.

04:16.279 --> 04:17.644
Really?

04:20.160 --> 04:21.810
See?

04:22.520 --> 04:24.680
Um, excuse me?

04:24.760 --> 04:25.921
Uh...

04:27.720 --> 04:30.120
This is my house.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.327
No. Listen, this is my house.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.651
We know each other.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.522
Oh.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.847
I don't know you.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.921
We must have lost our memories.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.565
Well...

05:05.160 --> 05:08.209
I wonder how we're gonna get those back.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.040
Well,

05:12.120 --> 05:15.720
obviously we should have sex

05:15.800 --> 05:18.880
and just hope for the best.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.851
- Wait.
- What?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.680
What if we're brother and sister?

05:29.410 --> 05:31.139
You're ruining this.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.482
Hey.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.531
Mmm.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.609
I'm gonna go to bed.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.847
Okay. I'll be in in a little bit.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.364
No, come now.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.651
Okay.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.763
I love you.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.283
I love you, too.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.726
Hey.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.285
Hmm?

06:47.280 --> 06:48.884
I really do.

06:51.440 --> 06:52.805
Good.

07:10.040 --> 07:11.929
Hey, will you grab the light?

08:00.760 --> 08:02.410
Hey, babe?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.280
Are you kidding me?

08:27.400 --> 08:29.320
This team doesn't care about winning.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.600
They're thinking about one thing
and that is the draft.

08:32.679 --> 08:36.760
I'm not saying they're tanking,
but the last thing they want is a win.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.440
This team's hope for the future
is on draft day.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.280
Hey, babe. Where are you?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.820
I don't remember what you said
you were doing today, but, uh...

08:52.200 --> 08:55.480
call me, okay?

08:55.560 --> 08:58.370
All right. Love you.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.960
Hi, Darcy?

09:05.040 --> 09:09.011
Um, listen, have you spoken
with Claire today?

09:10.240 --> 09:11.920
Okay.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.640
Um, no, no, everything's fine.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.640
I just don't know where she is.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.609
I'm sure she told me
and I'm just forgetting.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.967
And, hey, listen, if you hear from her,

09:22.080 --> 09:25.000
could you... Okay, great.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.570
Thanks, see ya.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.000
Hey, Mr. York, sorry.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.360
Um, it's David, Claire's boyfriend.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.480
Is she working today?

09:34.560 --> 09:36.840
She works tomorrow, not today.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.000
All right. And you haven't seen her?

09:39.080 --> 09:40.491
No.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.360
- Claire?
- Hey, what the fuck?

09:42.440 --> 09:44.408
Sorry, I'm looking for Claire.
Have you seen her?

09:44.560 --> 09:47.000
- You ruined my prints, man.
- Have you seen her?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.605
No.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.365
Shit.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.320
Did you guys have a fight before she left?

09:56.400 --> 09:59.320
- No, everything was fine.
- And what about recently?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.920
Did you guys have any disagreements?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.800
No.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.884
Have you, uh, have you called her parents?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.320
Claire?

10:07.400 --> 10:10.640
She doesn't have any family, actually.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.520
Okay. And you've spoken to her friends?

10:13.600 --> 10:15.682
Yes, I've spoken to her friends.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.360
Because sometimes people don't
even realize something was wrong.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.966
Nothing was was wrong, all right?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.640
- We're happy, so...
- Okay.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.720
Okay, well, what... What should I do?

10:30.800 --> 10:31.840
Anything helps.

10:31.920 --> 10:34.400
You know, reach out
to people that know her.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.440
If this isn't resolved in a few days,
we'll get you a printout of the report.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.240
A lot of people like to flyer
the neighborhood.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.200
You know, telephone poles and everything.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.489
Whoa, wait, wait. Flyer the neighborhood?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.480
- That's it?
- Hopefully, it won't come to that.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.211
Okay, I promise you
we're gonna do everything we can.

11:28.280 --> 11:30.280
Are you following me?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.240
What?

11:32.320 --> 11:33.401
No.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.522
Of course not.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.920
You live here?

11:43.000 --> 11:44.480
Uh, yeah.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.400
Oh, that's embarrassing.

11:46.480 --> 11:49.640
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.000
You know, it's just that for a second
you're gonna kill me.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.880
Wow, well, I definitely would not do that.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.080
I know, you're probably like a...

12:01.160 --> 12:03.128
like a school teacher or something.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.160
No, I'm not a school teacher.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.720
But... I like to think
I'm a pretty good guy.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.086
Yeah, I can see that now.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.601
Uh, I'm Claire.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.480
David.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.643
Hi, David, I just moved into 103.

12:22.060 --> 12:24.040
The Twisted Sister fan.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.720
Oh.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.320
I'm in 203, right above you.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.680
Oh, I'm sorry.
I... I can make it up to you.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.331
I can get you a gift or something.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.720
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.640
No, listen, I'm kidding, seriously.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.208
I mean, you can get me gifts,
by all means, but don't worry about it.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.766
Welcome to the building, Claire.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.360
- Hey, David.
- Hi, Colleen.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.320
How you doing?

13:32.400 --> 13:35.720
I'm... I'm good.

13:35.800 --> 13:40.040
Well, I really hate to do this to you,

13:40.120 --> 13:44.080
but, um, I really can't wait any longer.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.920
Uh, I'm so sorry.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.760
It's, you know, if it were up to me...

13:48.840 --> 13:50.240
I understand.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.481
Okay.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.489
All right, see ya.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.201
Hello?

14:30.840 --> 14:33.720
Sorry for dropping in without any warning.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.800
I didn't think I was gonna be
here more than an hour.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.320
Don't worry about it.
It's good to see you.

14:38.400 --> 14:43.120
It's nice to actually talk
to someone who really knew her.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.880
It's... It's been too long.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.769
I know, I know. I'm sorry about that.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.000
How have you been doing?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.820
Just the same, you know.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.120
It's just... It...

14:56.200 --> 14:57.884
It's too brutal, man, you know?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.320
It's unreal.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.160
Yeah, you know, best-case scenario

15:05.240 --> 15:08.320
is that she just left.

15:08.400 --> 15:12.920
And cops said that happens.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.685
That's the easiest thing
for me to imagine.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.680
I mean, the...
You know, the least painful.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.520
'Cause it's either that
or she... was killed,

15:23.600 --> 15:27.000
or she was taken.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.128
- Shit.
- Yeah.

15:30.680 --> 15:35.400
So, there were never
any leads or anything?

15:35.480 --> 15:36.686
No.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.048
Do you think it's possible that...

15:41.880 --> 15:43.640
you know, that she was unhappy?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.640
Fuck, man.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.610
I mean, she was the happiest
I'd ever seen her with you.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.200
You're a good match.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.490
And with Claire? I don't think
that was an easy thing to find.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.364
To Claire.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.520
Thanks for letting me crash, man.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.080
Yeah.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.520
So, where are you off to tomorrow?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.200
I'm going to the French Alps, man.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.840
Friend of mine has
an adventure-guide service thing.

16:18.920 --> 16:23.889
Take rich tourists climbing,
camping, make it feel dangerous.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.169
I'm gonna do a few trips with him,
make some money, and then...

16:30.160 --> 16:32.128
Hey, what are you doing?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.360
You think I can make it?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.080
Not without breaking your neck.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.360
Come on.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.040
Hey! Hey!

16:45.680 --> 16:47.840
What? You don't think I'll do it?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.080
You're being an idiot.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.571
Now, come on before someone see you.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.730
Dare me.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.480
Dare me.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.289
I dare you.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.359
Jesus.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.200
What the fuck is wrong with you?

17:12.280 --> 17:13.960
My leg.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.720
Is it broken?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.809
Aw, Jesus.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.560
Come on, man.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.800
Come on, let's get you home.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.000
Let's get you home.

17:33.995 --> 17:36.129
Now, come on. There you go.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.009
I got you.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.449
Shit.

18:11.160 --> 18:15.165
There he is. How you feeling?

18:15.280 --> 18:17.362
Hey, um...

18:19.360 --> 18:21.600
sorry about last night.

18:21.680 --> 18:25.280
I was just... you know, I was just drunk.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.489
No shit. You all right?

18:30.280 --> 18:33.600
Yeah, I'm just a little,
you know, bruised up,

18:33.680 --> 18:35.640
but I'll be fine.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.210
Okay.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.450
Okay.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.880
So, what's your plan today?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.450
My flight's not until 4:00.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.760
Oh, um...

18:51.840 --> 18:56.164
you know, actually,
I have a bunch of errands to run.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.000
I don't think I'll be back before then.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.280
But, you know, you can stay as you want.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.360
Just... you can just lock the door
when you leave, you know?

19:06.440 --> 19:08.720
Awesome, man. Thanks.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.087
- Yeah, no problem.
- Yeah.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.160
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.560
Are you busy?

19:45.640 --> 19:47.680
Uh, no, not really.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.440
Do you wanna eat?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.480
I kinda owe you.

19:51.560 --> 19:53.642
Come on.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.120
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry about the mess.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.400
No, I... I like your place.

20:00.480 --> 20:04.760
Really? Do you want a beer or something?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.720
Sure. Thank you.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.723
So, um...

20:09.760 --> 20:11.410
what do you do, Claire?

20:11.520 --> 20:16.480
Well, I'm currently pursuing
a career in dry cleaning.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.440
Doing what?

20:19.520 --> 20:22.480
I work at a dry cleaners.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.971
Oh.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.480
Did you take these?

20:30.560 --> 20:32.480
Yeah, it's a... it's a hobby of mine.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.600
Oh. I really like them.

20:35.680 --> 20:39.080
Where is that?

20:39.160 --> 20:41.840
I... Vancouver.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.160
What do you do?

20:43.240 --> 20:45.960
Graphic design sort of stuff.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.640
Nothing too exciting, but...

20:48.720 --> 20:50.449
Cool.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.405
What is that you got there?

20:54.520 --> 20:58.120
Dinner, and it should be ready in,
ooh, three and a half minutes.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.201
My God, that's not long.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.000
- Claire, that's not food.
- Sure, it is.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.003
You've been eating stuff like that?

21:04.120 --> 21:06.480
- Yeah, I mean...
- Put that down.

21:06.560 --> 21:10.440
Okay, I... I know
a little thing about food.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.440
Do you wanna come with me?
Can I make you something?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.164
Come here.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.211
End of the line, son.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.689
Can I just stay on for a while?

21:31.440 --> 21:32.880
What, this ain't a shelter, buddy.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.442
It's for getting
where you need to go, huh?

21:54.360 --> 21:56.840
Hey! Hey!

21:56.960 --> 21:58.520
What the fuck?

21:58.600 --> 22:00.120
Oh...

22:00.200 --> 22:01.560
you're home early.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.400
You said you'd be gone all day.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.600
What are you doing?

22:04.680 --> 22:08.605
Oh, man, David. I'm sorry.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.200
What the fuck is this?

22:10.280 --> 22:12.487
I'm just looking for something.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.841
That's all. I can't find it.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.361
You weren't supposed to come home.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.845
I don't understand.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.680
Yeah, Boulder really wasn't for me.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.440
Kind of ski bum, beer pong situation.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.200
I didn't make a ton of friends.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.760
Mmm, my God, this is so good.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.760
So, uh, where did you grow up?

22:40.840 --> 22:44.120
Salt Lake City. Pretty happening spot.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.441
Yeah. Birthplace of jazz.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.480
- Hmm?
- Nothing. Never mind.

22:50.560 --> 22:54.280
Um, your family still there?

22:54.360 --> 22:56.920
Family's not really part of the picture.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.280
Where are you from?

22:58.360 --> 23:00.880
San Jose, California.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.360
And your parents, they still live there?

23:03.440 --> 23:07.120
My, uh, my mom does, but my dad,

23:07.200 --> 23:09.360
he actually died when I was a kid.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.880
Which is a hilarious thing to talk about.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.600
But long story short, my mom,

23:14.680 --> 23:18.280
after he died, she, uh,

23:18.360 --> 23:20.600
she found, um, Jesus.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.600
Mmm.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.600
I'm... I'm aware of him.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.640
Yeah, well, apparently,
he was in San Jose,

23:27.720 --> 23:30.040
of all places, and now, you know,

23:30.120 --> 23:34.480
she collects these little baby figurines.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.960
Yeah, like...

23:37.040 --> 23:39.800
Like, you know, anything baby,

23:39.880 --> 23:42.520
like little baby sculptures.

23:42.600 --> 23:46.520
Anyways, now the house is filled

23:46.600 --> 23:51.800
with millions of little babies everywhere.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.120
Like, little angel babies.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.480
Yeah, it's, uh, it's a little...

23:57.560 --> 23:58.560
It's a little creepy.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.120
Also the whole place is kind of, um,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.280
kind of depressing, not just my...

24:03.360 --> 24:07.320
Not just my house,
but San Jose in general.

24:07.400 --> 24:08.960
I don't...

24:09.040 --> 24:12.360
It's a boring place.
I don't really like it there.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.520
You know, it's, uh...

24:14.600 --> 24:16.280
I go there sometimes, you know.

24:16.360 --> 24:19.000
Not as often as I should.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.923
But, yeah.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.600
I wanted to do that.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.489
That's, uh, that's okay.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.640
Oh, jeez.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.280
I'm still chewing my food.

24:39.360 --> 24:41.760
That's... No, wait, that's disgusting.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.360
His name is Buck Cameron.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.680
So, he's a friend?

24:47.760 --> 24:50.360
A friend of my girlfriend's from college.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.120
Is your girlfriend here?
Can I speak with her?

24:56.560 --> 24:59.040
No, she's not here.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.640
She, um,

25:00.720 --> 25:03.883
she disappeared a little over a year ago.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.403
She's missing.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.520
Hey, David.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.440
Hey. Detective Sloan.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.520
I heard what happened. You all right?

25:14.600 --> 25:17.400
Oh, yeah. My head hurts.

25:17.480 --> 25:18.560
Yeah, I bet.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.840
Doc said the CAT scan looks fine,

25:21.920 --> 25:23.888
gave me some medicine for the pain, so.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.960
Good. Look, the reason why I'm here

25:26.040 --> 25:29.960
is I figured rather than letting you get
the runaround from God knows who,

25:30.040 --> 25:31.960
I'd take a look for you.

25:32.040 --> 25:36.440
Your pal Buck never flew out yesterday,
not under that name at least.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.440
What do you mean under that name?

25:38.520 --> 25:40.400
You said he went
to the University of Colorado

25:40.480 --> 25:42.080
in Boulder, is that right?

25:42.160 --> 25:43.960
Yes, that's where Claire met him.

25:44.040 --> 25:46.200
There's no record of him there.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.040
That's gotta be a mistake.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.560
I don't think it is, David.

25:49.640 --> 25:53.440
On a hunch, I checked.
Claire didn't go there, either.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.000
Wait, wait. What do you...
what do you mean?

25:58.080 --> 26:00.360
Listen, David, you can tell me honestly.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.840
Do you know what he was looking for?

26:02.920 --> 26:05.240
No.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.766
So, you don't know if he found it, either.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.606
Do you know what he was looking for?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.120
You found me.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.120
Wow, this place is cool.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.123
Yeah.

28:58.560 --> 28:59.766
What's this?

28:59.880 --> 29:02.160
Oh, I made you some lunch.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.880
That's so sweet.

29:03.960 --> 29:07.089
Yeah, there's a little something inside.

29:09.880 --> 29:13.280
So, um, what have you been working on?

29:13.360 --> 29:15.240
Ugh, I've been looking at it all day.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.120
Well, I haven't. Let me see.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.320
You can see it when I do
something good, okay?

29:21.400 --> 29:22.400
Fine.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.245
When I'm done. Okay?

31:49.840 --> 31:51.251
Excuse me.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.483
Hey, sorry, uh, sorry
to bother you, but, um...

31:56.800 --> 31:58.880
have you seen this girl?

31:58.960 --> 32:01.930
Do you recognize her? No?

32:54.320 --> 32:55.920
- Jesus.
- You're not allowed back here.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.240
This is off-limits.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.480
I'm sorry, I was just looking around.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.527
Get out of here now.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.120
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

33:03.200 --> 33:04.240
Who is this?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.640
This is no one. He is confused.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.883
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.689
Is there something
that we can help you with?

33:17.280 --> 33:19.200
Yeah, have you, um,

33:19.280 --> 33:21.169
have you seen this girl?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.720
Do you recognize her?

33:24.800 --> 33:27.485
Fisnik, let go of the poor boy.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.960
This girl, how do you know her?

33:38.040 --> 33:40.240
Well, she's my girlfriend.

33:40.320 --> 33:44.530
She was my girlfriend. She disappeared.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.282
I see.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.522
That is very sad.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.360
Do you... Do you know her?

33:54.440 --> 33:55.840
No.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.720
Why would I know her?

33:57.800 --> 34:01.000
Look, I don't know. I just..

34:01.080 --> 34:04.880
Why do you come here
looking for this girl, huh?

34:04.960 --> 34:08.362
Uh, I was looking everywhere.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.880
But why do you come here?

34:12.840 --> 34:14.560
Uh... hey.

34:14.639 --> 34:17.600
She just spent a lot of time in this,

34:17.679 --> 34:19.679
in this area, so I thought maybe...

34:19.760 --> 34:21.560
What is your name?

34:21.639 --> 34:24.159
My name's David.

34:24.239 --> 34:27.483
Now you have a problem, David.

34:28.679 --> 34:32.199
What do you mean? What's my problem?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.043
I don't believe you.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.000
Hey, wait, I think we just have

34:42.080 --> 34:44.400
a bit of a misunderstan... Wait a minute.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.679
David, David. Look at me.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.684
You have to convince me now.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.120
I'm telling you the truth.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.843
Look, maybe... Let me just go home,
okay? I'll just go home.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.849
What do you do, David? What is your job?

35:05.920 --> 35:10.080
I, uh... I do graphic design.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.160
I design for websites.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.680
Ah.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.046
I believe that.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.090
Sit down.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.925
All right.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.046
Now... the truth.

35:44.960 --> 35:48.560
I don't... I don't know what to say.

35:48.640 --> 35:52.531
Don't pay attention to him.
Pay attention to me.

35:56.560 --> 35:58.722
What do you want?

35:58.840 --> 36:01.560
Why did you come here?

36:01.640 --> 36:04.080
I'm looking for my girlfriend.
She disappeared.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.640
I am starting to lose patience, David.

36:06.720 --> 36:09.360
I know that you are looking for this lady.

36:09.440 --> 36:11.560
Why here?

36:11.640 --> 36:13.449
I'm looking everywhere.

36:34.074 --> 36:36.361
Hey, hey, hey...

36:44.280 --> 36:45.880
So?

36:45.960 --> 36:47.680
Uh...

36:47.760 --> 36:52.280
I saw this address written down, okay?

36:52.360 --> 36:56.040
It was written on a piece
of paper in her handwriting.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.407
You know, I was just
cleaning out her things and...

37:00.040 --> 37:02.760
You know, I thought I'd just come here.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.640
I was just, just hoping that maybe...

37:10.320 --> 37:11.765
What is her name?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.843
Her name is Claire.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.121
Claire.

37:18.560 --> 37:23.124
Maybe it would be better for you
if you stopped looking for her.

37:24.600 --> 37:27.285
Maybe you don't like what you find.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.323
Detective Sloan?

37:56.880 --> 37:58.240
Yeah, um,

37:58.320 --> 38:01.880
I was wondering
if you could do me a favor.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.328
I was hoping you could check
on a few things for me.

38:41.160 --> 38:45.200
Can I ask you a question?

38:45.280 --> 38:47.282
Sure.

38:51.880 --> 38:53.440
You always change the subject

38:53.520 --> 38:59.323
whenever I ask you about
your family or anything.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.862
That's not a question.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.560
Why can't we talk about it?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.560
Why are you so interested in it?

39:09.640 --> 39:12.371
Well, I don't know, because...

39:14.240 --> 39:17.130
I'm in love with you.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.040
You are?

39:24.120 --> 39:25.531
Yeah.

39:26.720 --> 39:29.803
I mean, should I not be?

39:35.600 --> 39:40.242
Well, it's kind of out
of my control, so...

39:44.920 --> 39:47.207
What is it that you want?

39:49.480 --> 39:50.970
What are you after?

39:56.800 --> 39:58.689
You.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.963
Oh, shit.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.481
Does, uh, does your head hurt?

41:51.400 --> 41:53.760
You want some of these?

41:53.840 --> 41:56.047
It helps.

42:02.760 --> 42:07.040
I want you to answer
a few questions first,

42:07.120 --> 42:09.282
and then I'll give it to you.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.920
Why did you come here?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.241
I'm not gonna talk to you.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.600
Okay.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.966
All right.

42:29.280 --> 42:30.920
You're not gonna use that.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.685
How do you know?

42:35.000 --> 42:37.960
Just a feeling you get.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.640
What feeling?

42:40.720 --> 42:42.520
Fear.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.887
And you're not afraid right now?

42:46.520 --> 42:47.601
No.

43:10.200 --> 43:11.929
What about now?

43:13.840 --> 43:16.525
Do you know how much this hurts?

43:18.880 --> 43:21.400
Yeah, well, I do.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.970
Why did you come here?

43:27.120 --> 43:28.160
For information.

43:28.240 --> 43:29.920
What information?

43:31.200 --> 43:33.520
Anything I could find.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.840
Or get out of you.

43:37.280 --> 43:39.160
I don't know anything.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.720
You'd be surprised what you know.

43:46.440 --> 43:49.480
Do you know what happened to Claire?

43:49.560 --> 43:51.800
Huh?

43:51.880 --> 43:53.680
Did you do something to her?

43:59.360 --> 44:01.362
You think I know something?

44:02.920 --> 44:04.880
We're the same, David.

44:04.960 --> 44:07.320
We're both looking for the same thing.

44:07.400 --> 44:09.880
Yeah? What?

44:12.320 --> 44:13.731
Her.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.640
- Hey, David.
- Hey.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.085
Can I come in?

44:43.120 --> 44:45.000
Yeah, uh...

44:45.080 --> 44:47.048
Jesus Christ.

44:47.160 --> 44:50.164
Yeah. Sorry about... the mess.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.320
I did some digging around like you asked.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.084
Called in some favors.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.289
Why don't you sit down?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.128
She was lying to you.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.800
Okay.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.880
She didn't go to school in Boulder.

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
She didn't grow up
in Salt Lake City, either.

45:17.040 --> 45:20.400
Found no record of her parents there.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.680
Why would Claire lie about that?

45:22.760 --> 45:23.960
I mean, I'm looking into it,

45:24.040 --> 45:27.044
but listen, this girl's fucked up.

45:27.160 --> 45:29.920
You know, she was clearly
a part of something,

45:30.000 --> 45:33.440
or she just wasn't
who you thought she was.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.160
No, not really.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.280
No, I paid for a lot of things,

45:45.360 --> 45:49.251
but, you know,
she just didn't make that much.

45:51.240 --> 45:52.280
Right.

45:52.360 --> 45:54.000
Look, I think the best thing for you to do

45:54.080 --> 45:56.800
is to put her out of your head, move on.

46:01.080 --> 46:04.163
Uh... fucking cats.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.760
It's just clumsy.

46:05.840 --> 46:09.003
Hey, you know, thanks for your help.

46:12.840 --> 46:14.840
Look, if anything else pops up,

46:14.920 --> 46:16.410
I'll let you know.

46:30.760 --> 46:32.046
Hey, hey, hey.

46:37.160 --> 46:39.083
Come on.

46:46.280 --> 46:47.566
All right.

46:49.120 --> 46:50.760
How do you know Claire?

46:50.840 --> 46:52.440
I don't know her.

46:52.520 --> 46:55.490
Why are you looking for her?

47:02.080 --> 47:03.491
Open my shirt.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.600
- What?
- Open my shirt.

47:06.680 --> 47:09.411
You want to know why, open my shirt.

47:11.680 --> 47:13.330
Pull it open.

47:16.640 --> 47:20.326
There's two more in my stomach.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.326
She didn't expect me to live.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.960
No.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.849
No, that's not right.

47:30.800 --> 47:31.800
Claire couldn't...

47:31.880 --> 47:34.121
Claire?

47:35.400 --> 47:38.244
Eve is what she call herself.

47:40.280 --> 47:42.400
It was my brother she was after.

47:42.480 --> 47:44.120
He wasn't as lucky I was.

47:46.280 --> 47:51.120
They met in a bar in Chicago.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.880
He pick her up.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.928
The Hotel Marlaina.

47:57.560 --> 47:58.800
You know it?

47:58.880 --> 48:01.724
Yeah. It's nice.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.760
Also a good place to go

48:04.840 --> 48:08.760
if you're looking to pick up
high-end whore.

48:08.840 --> 48:10.649
And he was.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.481
Not my brother's typical taste, but...

48:17.840 --> 48:20.127
She put a knife in him.

48:26.560 --> 48:28.801
Do you have any brothers?

48:54.120 --> 48:57.283
What would you do if you found her?

49:00.320 --> 49:02.561
What would you do?

50:21.680 --> 50:24.520
My people are going to come
looking for me soon.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.524
Good. Then they can cut you loose.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.602
Oh. How much is this?

50:33.200 --> 50:35.400
They're not going to be happy
with what you've done.

50:35.480 --> 50:39.160
Well, maybe you can put in
a good word for me.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.920
All right. What's your name?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.890
- Aleksander.
- Aleksander.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.720
I'm David.

50:48.800 --> 50:50.723
Let's hope we never meet again.

51:09.280 --> 51:12.409
One ticket to Vancouver, please.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.800
Here we are. Lots of light.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.609
- Mm.
- Just painted.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.960
Yeah, it's, uh, it's wonderful.

51:30.040 --> 51:33.283
Yeah, all these houses
were built in the '20s.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.160
This one's 1916.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.600
Bought this place and the one next door

51:37.680 --> 51:40.200
about ten years ago, fixed 'em up.

51:40.280 --> 51:42.726
Please, take a look around.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.320
So, what do you think?

51:55.400 --> 51:56.920
I like it.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.760
- What are you doing?
- Here.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.160
I'm just showing you how to do it right.

52:25.240 --> 52:27.480
I like how I do it.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.640
Yeah, but it's wrong.

52:29.720 --> 52:32.000
It's not gonna look as good.

52:32.080 --> 52:33.280
I know how to paint.

52:33.360 --> 52:36.200
Mmm, I don't know if you do.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.520
Oh? Gonna be an asshole?

52:38.600 --> 52:40.760
Hey, I'm never an asshole.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.520
Uh, right now you are.

52:42.600 --> 52:45.524
Mmm, not really. I'm just kinda,
you know, being normal.

52:45.640 --> 52:49.240
Well, agree to disagree, I guess.

52:49.320 --> 52:51.800
Baby, we just have so much to do,

52:51.880 --> 52:54.560
and the ceiling is gonna take forever.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.400
You know what? I'll do the ceiling.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.880
You just relax.

52:59.360 --> 53:02.960
You're not going to do the ceiling.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.240
Why not?

53:04.320 --> 53:06.840
Because it's gonna be all messy and bad.

53:06.920 --> 53:10.040
Like your wall, which... sucks.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.320
You know what?

53:11.400 --> 53:12.765
I'm gonna do the ceiling right now,

53:12.880 --> 53:15.600
and it's gonna be incredible.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.560
Okay. If you say so.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.600
Yeah. Maybe you should go have a beer.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.440
You're getting very worked up
about the paint job.

53:23.520 --> 53:25.040
Hey.

53:25.120 --> 53:26.320
Word. Great.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.920
I'm all about that.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.764
Yeah, yeah.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.531
David, I'm done.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.160
Wow.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.520
That's, uh, that's beautiful.

53:57.600 --> 54:00.410
♪ Ta da ♪

54:02.480 --> 54:04.130
You mind?

54:11.240 --> 54:14.130
This is gonna be hell to paint over.

54:14.880 --> 54:17.600
- Tomorrow.
- Okay.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.527
Gimme your hand.

54:59.360 --> 55:01.408
I don't get it.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.565
"Sarah?"

55:06.520 --> 55:08.600
It's a joke.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.680
Isn't Sarah the name of the waitress

55:10.760 --> 55:13.001
that you like at what's-it-called?

55:13.120 --> 55:15.805
What? Sophie's?

55:15.920 --> 55:18.520
- Is her name Sarah?
- Yeah, right?

55:18.600 --> 55:21.000
It's a joke.

55:21.080 --> 55:24.084
Ah, it's incredibly hilarious.

55:33.200 --> 55:35.168
Much better.

55:38.520 --> 55:40.170
Yeah.

56:20.360 --> 56:22.806
So I got sort of a strange question.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.440
Do you, uh,

56:26.520 --> 56:29.040
recognize this guy?

56:29.120 --> 56:30.724
You know who he is?

56:32.880 --> 56:34.006
What's this about?

56:35.360 --> 56:37.080
Well, I, um, I got these photos

56:37.160 --> 56:38.680
off an old camera that I bought,

56:38.760 --> 56:44.320
and I thought maybe I could
get them back to their rightful owner.

56:44.400 --> 56:46.000
Any ideas?

56:46.080 --> 56:47.520
That's Mr. Garan.

56:47.600 --> 56:51.880
Mr. Garan. Does he work here?

56:51.960 --> 56:53.200
He used to.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.880
Mr. Garan passed five years ago.

56:56.960 --> 56:59.280
He was a good man.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.407
All right.

57:00.520 --> 57:03.880
Well, I'm sorry to... Sorry to hear that.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.645
Thank you.

57:09.840 --> 57:12.889
Do you know, was he married?

57:54.960 --> 57:57.880
Hello. My name is David.

57:57.960 --> 57:59.600
Are you a reporter?

57:59.680 --> 58:01.400
No, no, absolutely not.

58:01.480 --> 58:05.640
Look, this is a little hard
to explain, but, um,

58:05.720 --> 58:08.200
my girlfriend, she disappeared

58:08.280 --> 58:14.280
a little over a year ago,
and ever since then I, um...

58:14.360 --> 58:18.280
Look, I'm sorry. I just know that
she spent a lot of time here in Vancouver

58:18.360 --> 58:20.240
before I knew her, and I know

58:20.320 --> 58:23.760
that she was really interested
in your... in your husband.

58:23.840 --> 58:29.200
Um, look, I'm just grasping
at straws here,

58:29.280 --> 58:30.920
and I just...

58:31.000 --> 58:33.844
Do you... Do you recognize her?

58:35.520 --> 58:37.761
I met a lot of people with Richard.

58:37.880 --> 58:39.360
- I'm sorry.
- Well, her name was...

58:39.440 --> 58:40.640
I don't know her.

58:40.720 --> 58:43.405
I'm very sorry. Good luck.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.360
Agh! Aah!

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.800
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.248
No, stop! Stop! Please!

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.245
Oh...

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.440
Stop.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.440
No, please! Help me!

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:38.680
Help me! No, no, no! Please!

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.720
Don't move. Get down on your knees.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.450
Down on your knees.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.644
Where are we going?

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.684
Get out.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.165
David, how do you do? John Hall.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.485
Thanks, guys.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.607
I apologize. We must have frightened you.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.000
What do you want?

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.280
I wanna talk to you.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.964
And who the fuck are you?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.363
I work for the government. Defense.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.760
I tell ya...

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.880
I don't usually go in for this
nature shit, but God damn.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.560
This is something, huh?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.324
Take a look at that.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.809
Makes your heart go.

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.169
Yeah, you're looking
for your ex-girlfriend.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.360
You knew her, I guess?

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:50.965
Yes.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.600
I'm here to answer
a few of your questions.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:58.365
The ones I can, at least.
Give you some closure.

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.521
But none of this is gonna be easy, David.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.405
Okay?

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.480
Claire worked for us
in a variety of capacities.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.160
- Like what?
- Mmm.

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.926
It was required that she establish
a cover, a life,

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.883
one that would allow
for a great deal of travel,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.367
one that wouldn't draw a lot of attention.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.366
So, where is she?

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.040
July of last year,
she was called in for an assignment.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.522
She was killed in action 36 hours later.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.881
I'm sorry, David.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.920
No.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.040
See, you're lying.
That doesn't make sense.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.249
I really am sorry to tell you.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.720
Okay.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.531
Okay, well, do you have any...

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.680
any proof, huh?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.840
Of any of this?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.925
I mean, you're so interested
in giving me closure.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.120
Open this if you have to,
but I've seen what's inside,

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.960
and I wouldn't, if I were you.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.690
I mean it.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:39.723
We need you to stop
digging around her past, David.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.240
She handled sensitive material.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.880
Sensitive situations
that don't need stirring

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:48.724
by your inexpert hands.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.927
It's dangerous. For you, for all of us.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.920
Just let it go, okay?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.005
You're still on the outside. Stay there.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.731
I can't guarantee your safety otherwise.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.046
Take your time.

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.091
Hey.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.525
Babe.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.970
Hey.

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.244
Hey, Claire.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.040
Babe.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.407
Babe. Let me in.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.050
What's wrong?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.569
Claire.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.680
Answer me.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.404
Claire, open the door.

01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.689
Claire, open the door, please?

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.849
Cl... Claire.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.241
Claire!

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.800
Hey. Hey, hey.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.640
Oh. Ah, Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God, what happened?

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.080
I got mugged. I was stupid,
I... I tried to fight back.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.520
No, no, no, no.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.080
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.044
Come here. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.569
So, what was her name?

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.484
Was it Claire?

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.849
Can I ask you a question?

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.242
What brought you to Garan's house?

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:37.960
Just photos.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.600
Old photos she had before I knew her.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.040
Regular Philip Marlowe, am I right?

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.920
So, who was he?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.684
You tell me.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.240
Some rich venture capitalist?

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:55.480
That's right.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.769
Weekends, he liked to put on a red hood,

01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:01.080
convince discontented teens
to join the cause

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.650
of white supremacy.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760
He put enough cash in the right pockets

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.000
to keep that fact secret.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.051
So what, you just... had him killed?

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:14.411
Richard Garan died of a heart attack.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.560
Oh, yeah.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:25.120
I had a run in with some
Columbian mercenaries

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.960
a couple years back.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.441
More metal than man at this point.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.840
That must've been a long recovery.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.120
Oof. Two years physical therapy

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.400
before I stopped walking like
a zombie from those bad movies.

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.440
What, were you, like, on crutches

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:47.240
for a while or something?

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.401
A cane.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.240
You said you have those photos
on your computer?

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.720
You mind if I take a look?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.245
Did I say that?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.886
Yeah. You mind if I take a look?

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.481
No, um...

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.804
Thanks.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.969
Hmm.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:36.520
I'm asking myself, "Why is he
so interested in my rehab?"

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.003
But I realize you haven't been
completely honest with me, have you?

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.840
David...

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.127
Where are the negatives?

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.807
No. Really?

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.440
Son of a bitch.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:04.160
It's amazing how things change so quick.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.722
What was it, a minute ago,
80 seconds tops,

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.080
you made that comment about
my leg and tipped your hand.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:13.760
You were gonna go home, live a life,

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:16.560
meet a girl probably, have a couple kids.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.560
She's still alive.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.529
Hmm?

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.000
She's alive. Isn't she?

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.243
She's dead.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.201
Take this left.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:43.806
Where'd you get that?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.960
Let me out.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:47.480
Here. Pull over.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.961
No, don't. Don't pull over, Michael.

01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.000
What a mess.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.243
Nothing's gone as I intended,
not one thing.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.491
Hey.

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:34.128
Hey.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.167
I tried you at the darkroom.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.280
I had my headphones on.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.442
Mmm. How was it?

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.806
It was fine.

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.440
Did you bring anything back?

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.520
No.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:10.161
There wasn't anything good enough to save.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.244
Is something wrong?

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.001
I'm just tired.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.649
And that's the end of it.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.451
Just tired, David.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.608
What, you wanna have
a whole conversation about that?

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.880
I just haven't seen you all day.

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.720
I was working.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.400
No, I, uh, I know.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.040
You've been working every night

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.088
for the past three weeks.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:44.360
I haven't seen you.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.800
I'm sorry that I wanna have
a conversation with you when I do.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.560
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
that I wanna sleep when I'm tired.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.280
Wow, you're being such a bitch right now.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:58.200
What?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.920
Fuck you.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.604
Hey.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.320
Hey, does this have to do
with what happened?

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:11.200
What are you talking about?
Does what have to do with it?

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.720
The fact that you won't speak to me.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.680
That you're a million miles away

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.360
and I can't bring you back.

01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.600
Don't be such a drama queen.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.240
I'm right here.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.005
Then why does it feel like
as close as I get to you,

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.720
- I'm not even...
- I don't know, David.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.440
Maybe I'm broken that way.
Maybe it's impossible.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:35.842
It sure fucking seems like it, Claire.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.520
Yeah, well...

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.960
I'm glad that we figured that out.

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.407
I'm gonna go to sleep.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.329
All right.

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.726
Good night.

01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.240
Can I help you?

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.200
Hi, um...

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.600
I was wondering if I could talk
to you for a minute.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.000
Okay.

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:06.650
It's about Dana.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.048
Have a seat.

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.605
Thanks.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:18.280
Oh, did you get married?

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.040
Yeah. Elise.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.120
Year ago next week.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.080
So...

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.245
So... you and Dana.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:31.560
She went missing five years ago?

01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:35.400
Yeah. Vanished.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.164
You two were happy?

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.720
I don't know.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.920
I thought we were.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.600
What are you getting at?

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.760
I'm sorry.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.920
I met her

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.641
about four years ago.

01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.523
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.240
Is she, uh...

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.240
She's gone.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:18.960
It was a bad car accident.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.883
It was about a year ago.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.888
And ever since then, I...

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.608
started looking into her past,
which led me to you.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.920
And I just thought
that you'd want to know,

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.800
just so you could stop looking

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:40.962
in case you were.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.560
Yeah.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.291
Fuck, I'm...

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:52.920
Uh, I'm sorry, I didn't...

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.360
I didn't expect to be
thinking about this today.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.922
She talk about me?

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.491
She didn't tell me much about her past.

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:08.083
Sounds like her.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.680
I did look for her for a while,

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:17.206
but who walks out like that?

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.280
Maybe I was an asshole? I think about it.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.520
I think maybe I... Maybe I was
a little too hard on her.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:32.040
She just... You know,
we just weren't a good match.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.690
Doesn't mean you walk out, though.

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:37.040
You don't let a person wonder,

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.720
even if she hated me.

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.087
She didn't.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.880
I'm certain she loved you.

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:49.531
You can't fake that.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.890
Well, this is all I have.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.690
Dana took those.

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.320
Well, listen, I appreciate you coming,

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.760
but I should get to work.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.410
Of course, yeah.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:25.840
Hey, Charlie.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.888
This guy here.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.600
That's Kyle.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.080
That's Dana's friend from home.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.600
That's Kyle.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:38.080
You two stay in touch?

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:40.480
I mean, not really since she left.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.160
We talked a few times, but you know.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.531
You got a number for him?
I'd like to reach out.

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.600
Hey, Kyle. Or Buck.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.960
Or whatever the fuck your name is.

01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.120
This is David Larraine.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.647
Yeah, I got your number,
fuckshit, and, hey, listen,

01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.680
you know that thing you were
looking for at my place?

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:04.640
Well, guess what? I have it.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.600
If you want it, you're gonna meet me

01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:09.960
on the southwest corner
of Blake and Van Nuys

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.960
the morning of the sixth, 3:00 a.m.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.480
Come alone, and, I don't know,

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.520
bring a million dollars with you.

01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.480
If not, these pictures
are going everywhere,

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.040
and I have a feeling if that happens,

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:24.160
you're gonna wind up in a ditch someplace.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.280
Am I right?

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.566
See you Friday.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:06.960
- Hello?
- Hey, Aleksander. This is David Larraine.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.400
If you wanna know where Eve is.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.560
I'm meeting her at 3:00 a.m.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.405
She'll be in a black SUV parked in a lot

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:18.680
on the south side of Van Nuys
just east of Blake.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:21.081
She's all yours.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.324
What the fuck is this?

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.640
Shit.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.160
Where is she?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.522
- David?
- Throw your phone in the gutter

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.320
and head up Van Nuys,
enter the parking structure.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:36.680
On the left, there'll be a car parked

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.320
with its door open.

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:39.800
Get in.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:42.000
I want to be left alone. Okay?

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.440
I will go away,

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:47.320
and you will never hear from me again.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:49.560
I have what you're looking for,

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.560
but you're never gonna find it.

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:55.760
If I die, everybody finds it.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.600
That's not how this works.

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.920
How does it work?

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.200
You are just a scared guy

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:05.760
that threw me in the back
of a blacked-out Beemer.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.120
We're something else.

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.520
We're a different category of person.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:13.400
You wanna keep those pictures
as an insurance policy?

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:17.280
People like I work for can't live
with that in this world.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.840
If I die, they get out.

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.680
To who, David? Hmm?

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:26.040
You haven't thought this through.

01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.770
The New York Times?

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.040
They won't know what the fuck they are.

01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.920
I'm sorry, David.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.120
Sarah was a threat.
You are just a loose end.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.240
And there is a bullet
coming your way right now.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.448
It is cutting through this world,

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.880
and it can only end up in one place.

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:45.880
No.

01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:48.120
I'll find a way.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:50.560
You underestimate me, Buck.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:53.800
You have every step of the way.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.600
Mm, no, not this time.

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.047
Smart, blacking out the windows,

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.240
no one can see in.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.560
Trouble is, you can't see out, either.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.440
You have no idea what's coming.

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:10.960
- Out of the car! Get out of the car!
- Hand in the air!

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.327
One the ground! Don't move!

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.885
Are you mad?

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.804
Come here.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.524
Have I really been a million miles away?

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.089
Mm-hmm.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:28.242
I got lost.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.240
It happens now and then.

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.000
Okay.

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.527
But you can't leave me out there, though.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.842
You gotta bring me back.

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.048
I always will.

01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.404
Promise?

01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.524
No matter what.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:47.089
David. We meet again.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:53.611
Where's the film?

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:58.324
I'm not going to tell you.

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:02.680
Okay. That's what I thought you'd say.

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.880
I'm gonna send a man in here.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:07.040
It's his job to get information

01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:09.880
from reluctant sources.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:11.720
Usually he's working
with trained operatives

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.040
who've been prepared for such treatment

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.248
and who believe if they
give up the information,

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:19.520
it will cost many of their
countrymen their lives,

01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:24.083
not to mention compromise
their own place in the afterlife.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.920
You, on the other hand,

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.680
are protecting the whereabouts
of a roll of film,

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.843
the significance of which
you don't understand,

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.880
for a dead girl who lied to you,

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.281
used you, and made a fool of you.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.000
Anyway, I'm gonna walk out.

01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.120
He's gonna come in, and in a few minutes

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.400
he's gonna leave with what he came for.

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:53.329
Or you could tell me now,
spare yourself the discomfort.

01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:06.044
All right.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.280
You're very brave, David.

01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.640
I admire that. Truly.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.409
Thanks for coming.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.887
David? My name's David.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.809
Where's the film?

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.567
I don't... I don't have it.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.800
Where's the film?

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.040
I don't have it.
I don't have it. I don't...

01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.760
Please, please, stop! Stop! Stop!

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.923
Where's the film?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.241
Stop! St...

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.080
What's going on?

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:25.447
Do not move!

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:51.683
David.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.880
What did he do to you?

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.530
Where have you been?

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:00.770
Why did they do this?

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:03.040
I came looking for you.

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.240
I just got so close.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.840
How?

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:10.320
The film in the garden.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:11.890
Your film.

01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:29.131
Where is it?

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.560
Home.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.085
It's at our home.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:42.760
- We have to get out of here.
- Wait, wait.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.320
David, there's no time for that.

01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:45.760
We gotta go.

01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.969
You can use one of these? Come on.

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:15.920
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.286
Come on.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.001
Jesus Christ.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:48.080
Damn it. Shit.

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.801
We gotta get out of here. Get out!

01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.763
Shit.

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:11.563
Stay here.

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.283
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.443
Get off the bike. Off the bike.

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.246
Get out of here, come on.
Come on, let's go.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.644
Where is it, David? The film?

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.169
In the mail.

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.200
Well, that's not good.

01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.680
What is it?

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:58.280
It's proof that Hall had been turned.

01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.691
It was...

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.884
This was my only protection.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:05.800
- Claire...
- We have to get out of here.

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.760
Claire. Wait. Stop.

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:09.720
- They'll be looking for us...
- Stop.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.280
I haven't seen you.

01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.840
Are you hurt?

01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:21.000
- Where? David?
- Oh.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.880
David. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.806
Who are you?

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.561
I'm a lot of different people.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:44.840
I looked for you.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:47.000
I know.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.800
I didn't think you'd understand.

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:51.247
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:57.080
If you come with me,

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:59.049
we can never, ever come back.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.286
Stay here.

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.120
Shit.

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.204
- What?
- We're surrounded.

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.727
So, what do we do now?

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:46.125
We fight.

01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:31.687
Hey. Look at that.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:36.643
I didn't know you could still see it.

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.884
Me, neither.

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.286
Hey. Where we gonna go?

01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:52.320
Anywhere you want.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.720
Well, I wanna go someplace warm,

01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.160
somewhere I've never been.

01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:59.760
Far away?

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:01.200
Yeah.

01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:03.521
When?

01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:07.720
Let's go right now.

01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.691
Hall's men are out back.
Aleksander's are out front.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.326
What do you think our best chances are?

01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:22.080
Not good either way.

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:24.401
All right.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.400
You choose.

01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.760
No, you.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:33.760
Okay, fine.

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.684
Um... South America?

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:40.560
Are we really gonna do this?

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:43.000
Yes.

01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.760
We have to.

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:49.009
Okay.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.404
Ready?

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:04.480
On three.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.440
Hey, babe?

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:08.600
I love you.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.440
Hey.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.080
Let's live.

01:46:13.160 --> 01:46:14.810
Yeah.

01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.800
- Okay.
- Ready?

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:22.850
One, two, three.
