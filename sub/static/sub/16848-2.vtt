Previously on Childrens
Hospital:

00:03.204 --> 00:04.772
I don't have
a brain tumor.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.608
I couldn't think of a reason
to break up with you.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.543
That's just the brain tumor
talking.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.480
I could fix a fuel pump using
the power of laughter.

00:15.616 --> 00:18.552
What are you gonna use,
like, a wrench or something?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.588
One day, I'm gonna get
a real job...

00:20.621 --> 00:23.257
...in a real hospital
with real adult patients.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.593
-Tiny breast implant.
-Tiny breast implant.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.729
-They're getting tinier.
-Freeze.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.343
Attention, staff:
Thanks to all of you

00:42.376 --> 00:44.245
for not remembering my
birthday.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.780
Listen up, people.

00:46.814 --> 00:49.350
Damn it. First up
on the docket,

00:49.383 --> 00:51.585
the answer to yesterday's
trivia question is--

00:52.353 --> 00:54.255
WANT 2 DO

00:54.288 --> 00:58.092
The answer-- The answer is--

00:58.126 --> 00:59.727
YOU

01:00.894 --> 01:03.464
-Pubis.
-Yes.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.533
-I knew it. Dumb.
-Did not know that.

01:05.566 --> 01:10.338
All right, next up, it saddens
me to have to announce...

01:10.371 --> 01:13.541
...that Dr. Lola Spratt
has a brain tumor.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.810
What? You told everyone
I have a brain tumor?

01:16.844 --> 01:18.612
You need your friends right now.

01:18.646 --> 01:21.882
I told you that as a lie so
that we could break up.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.785
Okay, listen, everybody.
I don't have a brain tumor.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.820
That's right, you don't
have a brain tumor.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.356
That's what I said.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.391
-You don't have a brain tumor.
-I know.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.626
Keep saying that.
You don't have a brain tumor.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.596
-I don't--
-You don't have a brain tumor.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.531
You don't have a brain tumor.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.767
-That's your mantra.
-You don't have a brain tumor.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.669
You don't have a brain tumor.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.138
-All right, people. Next.
-Wait.

01:44.172 --> 01:50.478
I wanna go over how sick
and tired I am of rude waiters.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.380
You're sitting there
for 15 minutes,

01:52.413 --> 01:55.649
and the guy comes over and he's
like:"Can I take your order?"

01:55.683 --> 01:58.352
Is that annoying,
or am I crazy?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.521
-Happens all the time.
-You're not crazy.

02:03.824 --> 02:08.196
Hey. You have a brain tumor?
Why didn't you tell me that?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.597
I did tell you, okay?

02:09.630 --> 02:12.433
It was a lie that I told Owen
to break up.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.934
-Remember?
-No.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.237
God, your tumor
must be affecting my memory.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.573
-Oh, please, let's not.
-Where have you been staying?

02:19.607 --> 02:22.410
-I miss my roommate.
-What, are we girlfriends now?

02:22.443 --> 02:25.179
You wanna get matching
cargo shorts and tool belts?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.315
-I want my best friend back.
-Oh, really?

02:27.348 --> 02:28.949
It sounds like
you wanna scissor me

02:28.982 --> 02:31.385
in the back of
a Girls Gone Wild trailer.

02:31.419 --> 02:34.355
Hey. Stop.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.757
We were drunk.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.827
Let's just-- Let's just pretend
it didn't happen.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.339
God, this cold
is kicking my ass.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.407
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.809
Does it feel even worse
because of your brain tumor?

02:58.011 --> 03:01.282
Looks like you're leading the
league in malpractice, Richie?

03:01.315 --> 03:03.351
You wanna explain
why you would try

03:03.384 --> 03:05.786
and give an 11-month-old girl
breastimplants?

03:05.819 --> 03:10.458
I thought she was 11 years old.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.726
Says here you gave
a 10-year-old boy liposuction.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.562
He looked fat on the CAT scan.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.265
You sewed two identical twins
together?

03:17.298 --> 03:20.434
-I was in Siam, guy.
-Threw a newborn in the trash.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.903
I'm a neat freak.
Look, I am a good doctor

03:22.936 --> 03:24.738
with great malpractice
insurance.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.940
-Get off my case.
-Your case is grass.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.014
All right.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.650
My girlfriend and I broke up.
I was distracted.

03:38.919 --> 03:42.323
You know what it's like
to lose a partner, right?

03:44.525 --> 03:47.561
Lose a partner. Lose a partner.
Lose a partner.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.833
September 11, 2001

03:55.803 --> 03:57.571
Rough day, eh, partner?

03:57.605 --> 04:02.476
-This date will live in infamy.
-Yeah.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.313
September 12th, 2001.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.483
It's the 11th.

04:09.517 --> 04:13.721
-I don't think so.
-Yeah, it's definitely the 11th.

04:14.855 --> 04:18.791
Nope. It's the 12th. See?

04:18.826 --> 04:21.995
That must be wrong, because
it's definitely the 11th.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.332
It's been all over the news
and everything.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.600
My grandfather's watch
has never been wrong.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.402
I'm sorry, it's wrong today.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.904
Man, why you being such a dick
about this?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.341
Oh, I'm being a dick?
You're gonna feel like

04:33.374 --> 04:36.744
a real jerk when we finally
get to a calendar.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.380
It just so happens I have a
third-party calendar app

04:39.413 --> 04:41.415
on my Motorola.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.617
-Let's do this right now.
-Fine. I'm right here.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.920
I hope we invade Iraq.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.891
No.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.361
11-Sept 2001
MENU

04:53.394 --> 04:55.596
No!

04:56.697 --> 04:57.965
I quit.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.905
Hey, there he is.
Where did we go?

05:06.407 --> 05:10.110
I told you, you piece of shit.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.546
I hope we invade Iraq.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.794
Previously on Childrens
Hospital:

05:26.827 --> 05:29.630
This is 99 percent effective

05:29.663 --> 05:32.065
in preventing
sexually transmitted diseases.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.868
And this...

05:34.902 --> 05:40.541
...is 100 percent effective
in getting me hard.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.644
-I broke up with Glenn.
-What, are we girlfriends now?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.514
You wanna buy Jeeps and start
a dog-walking business?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.416
I just want
tmy best friend back.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.484
You're a mess.
You know that, don't you?

05:50.518 --> 05:52.920
Figure out your life.

05:55.556 --> 06:01.161
Monkeys, that's all we are.
Primates in an urban jungle

06:01.194 --> 06:03.497
walking upright
and throwing our poop

06:03.531 --> 06:06.834
into the ever-changing
winds of love.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.404
He's got the rarest case of
advanced aging disease seen.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.507
Advanced aging disease?
Why are you telling me?

06:13.541 --> 06:15.075
I'm chief
surgeon.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.945
Yeah, which makes you
an administrator as well.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.980
The best damn administrator
in all of Brazil.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.584
-Come on.
-Which, is where we are now.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.886
This hospital is in Brazil,
as we all know.

06:25.919 --> 06:31.058
But anyway, you have a gift.
The gift of administration.

06:31.091 --> 06:34.094
Just like me with the healing
power of laughter.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.138
Damn it.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.841
Anyway, it takes more than
the healing power of laughter...

06:47.875 --> 06:50.077
...to know if a kid with
advanced aging disease

06:50.110 --> 06:52.780
belongs in a children's
hospital.

06:52.813 --> 06:55.716
You get up there
and you administrate.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.758
What the fuck are you doing?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
You're giving some
real mixed signals.

07:06.694 --> 07:09.229
That's-- Okay. Forget it.
Never happened.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.832
Attention, staff: Red alert.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
All hands report
to battle stations.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.636
I repeat, red alert.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.506
-My body feels too big.
-Oh, honey, I know.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.441
It's called growing pains,
at an extraordinary rate.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.581
Hi, I'm Chief,
the chief surgeon.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.750
Surgeon? Does Nicky
need surgery?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.255
Doubtful.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.657
How old is Nicky?

07:36.690 --> 07:39.026
-Six.
-I like turtles.

07:39.059 --> 07:43.130
He used to be tall for his age,
but now he's just average.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.099
I wish I were as wise
as I am hairy.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.968
Adorable.

07:48.001 --> 07:51.204
Well, I think you are perfect
for Childrens Hospital, Nicky.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.842
And I am going to assign you
the prettiest doctor here.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.578
I want a dinosaur doctor.

07:57.611 --> 08:02.182
Well, I don't have a dinosaur,
but I do have a Cat.

08:02.215 --> 08:06.754
Love and life, life and love,
they sound so much alike.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.221
But you can't fall in life--

08:08.255 --> 08:10.257
You know, sometimes I feel
my life is

08:10.290 --> 08:12.693
like a blackjack table.
We don't choose our cards,

08:12.726 --> 08:14.027
we just keep taking hits.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.863
We can have a life
with someone,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.698
but we can't choose
who we love.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.732
-Cat.
-This bitch again?

08:18.766 --> 08:21.602
Yeah?

08:21.635 --> 08:23.837
I got a case
of advanced aging disease,

08:23.871 --> 08:25.673
and I want you to take it.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.308
-Could be a career maker.
-Whore.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.010
Great. Cunt.

08:30.043 --> 08:33.013
Now, what was I thinking again?

08:33.046 --> 08:35.048
Okay, rather than stick you
full of needles

08:35.082 --> 08:36.817
and fill you full of pills...

08:36.850 --> 08:39.986
...I'm gonna try and cure you
the old-fashioned way...

08:40.020 --> 08:42.121
...using the healing power
of laughter.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.324
Okay? You ready?

08:44.357 --> 08:49.029
This is a quarter. Now,
I'm going to grab it

08:49.062 --> 08:52.600
using sleight
of hand...

08:52.633 --> 08:54.234
...and then make it appear
as though

08:54.267 --> 08:58.005
I'm retracting it
from your ear. Ta-da.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.840
That being said,
please don't stick anything

08:59.873 --> 09:02.275
in any of your holes,
uptown or downtown.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.681
Okay, that didn't work.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.150
All right. There once
was a man from Nantucket...

09:10.183 --> 09:11.852
...whose penis was
so abnormally large

09:11.885 --> 09:14.622
that he could reach it
with his own mouth.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.191
Fuck.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.695
Who's to say who we should love
and who we shouldn't?

09:21.729 --> 09:25.599
We just have to be in the right
place at the right time.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.901
Hey, elephant.

09:27.935 --> 09:28.936
Hi.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.239
Hi.

09:33.173 --> 09:36.076
Hello. Hi, pretty girl.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.578
My elephant is gray
like my beard.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.651
Everything's fast forward
with me.
