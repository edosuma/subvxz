WEBVTT

00:05.147 --> 00:07.380
Danny, I think I've finally
figured it out.

00:07.381 --> 00:10.850
Sure, being a working mom whose
fiance is 48 states away

00:10.851 --> 00:12.652
certainly has its challenges.

00:13.921 --> 00:15.555
Aw, man.

00:15.556 --> 00:18.325
It's hard being on your own,
balancing work and family

00:18.326 --> 00:19.826
while also finding time to stay

00:19.827 --> 00:22.162
slutty anime
character-level hot.

00:22.163 --> 00:23.697
Sure, I've gotten
the hang of it,

00:23.698 --> 00:26.032
but when I first tried this
move I nicked my leg so bad

00:26.033 --> 00:28.769
I couldn't tell what was blood
and what was pancake syrup.

00:29.250 --> 00:32.622
So basically I'm doing everything
that I need to be doing.

00:32.624 --> 00:35.410
That's great. So, you put your
apartment up for sale!

00:37.327 --> 00:40.487
I have not. I just have
so many memories on that place.

00:40.488 --> 00:43.087
Do you know how many dudes
I've slayed there?

00:43.088 --> 00:45.300
All the more reason
to sell it!

00:46.127 --> 00:47.620
I guess so.

00:48.493 --> 00:50.840
Hey, any news
when you're coming home?

00:51.307 --> 00:54.066
Don't kill me,
but I'm hoping by Christmas.

00:54.067 --> 00:55.370
What?

00:55.770 --> 00:59.457
Christmas? That's three holiday Reese's
Peanut Butter Cup shapes from now!

00:59.458 --> 01:01.543
Can't you make it home
by Turkey-shape?

01:01.973 --> 01:03.747
I know, it's hard for me too.

01:03.748 --> 01:05.770
I changed my ringtone
to "Fat Bottomed Girls"

01:05.771 --> 01:07.196
just to feel closer to you.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.991
What? No.

01:08.992 --> 01:11.591
Okay. Give your weiner
a honk for me.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.403
I will.
Give Leo a kiss for me.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.785
Prices have gone up,
so swab responsibly.

01:18.786 --> 01:21.054
Any other announcements?

01:21.055 --> 01:23.923
I have an announcement.
This meeting sucks.

01:23.924 --> 01:26.192
Peter,
you don't work here anymore.

01:26.193 --> 01:27.394
You're on vacation.

01:27.395 --> 01:28.862
You're free to
leave at any time.

01:28.863 --> 01:30.163
I have an announcement.

01:30.164 --> 01:31.665
I need somebody to fill
in for me tomorrow night

01:31.666 --> 01:33.533
- to meet Gordon.
- Who's Gordon?

01:33.534 --> 01:35.335
I feel like I don't know anybody.
This meeting sucks.

01:35.336 --> 01:36.936
Gordon's in charge of collecting

01:36.937 --> 01:39.172
all the medical waste, and it's
Tamra's turn to wait for him.

01:39.173 --> 01:41.608
Yeah, I've filled in
for Tamra so many times

01:41.609 --> 01:43.910
that Gordon thinks
that we got something going on.

01:43.911 --> 01:47.147
- He gave me a blouse.
- I'm sorry, I have a thing.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.448
Oh, you know what you should do?

01:48.449 --> 01:49.883
You should call an arbitrator.

01:49.884 --> 01:51.384
That's what Danny and I did when
we couldn't decide

01:51.385 --> 01:53.119
on a couple's costume
for Halloween.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.755
We ended up going as Cheech
and Kate Middleton. I remember...

01:55.756 --> 01:59.459
Mindy, we can't have
every conversation pivot to Danny.

01:59.460 --> 02:02.629
You know who always says that?
Danny.

02:02.630 --> 02:03.963
Any announcements not to do with

02:03.964 --> 02:06.566
missing your fiance
in California?

02:06.567 --> 02:10.670
I have an announcement.
This meeting sucks.

02:18.273 --> 02:20.593
Yo, Schmindy?
You ready to rip the town up?

02:20.594 --> 02:22.328
Hey, where's
your mesh party bra?

02:22.329 --> 02:24.330
If you're not gonna wear it,
can I?

02:24.331 --> 02:26.398
Oh, Peter, I can't.

02:26.399 --> 02:28.334
I promised Leo
that I'd watch "Dora" with him.

02:28.335 --> 02:29.535
You can come with.

02:29.536 --> 02:30.903
The promos were ambiguous,

02:30.904 --> 02:32.705
but I think it's about
a grumpy Tortuga.

02:32.706 --> 02:34.239
I've seen that one.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.308
You know, this is my last
weekend in New York, Mindy.

02:36.309 --> 02:37.443
We haven't partied once.

02:37.444 --> 02:38.944
I've just been hanging
out with Jeremy.

02:38.945 --> 02:40.412
He's taken me to The Frick
so many times I don't even

02:40.413 --> 02:42.147
laugh at the name anymore.

02:42.148 --> 02:43.482
I'm going to have
to go around town

02:43.483 --> 02:46.352
and hang up these open house
flyers for my apartment.

02:46.353 --> 02:47.486
I'm selling it.

02:47.487 --> 02:49.221
Wait a minute.
You're not partying

02:49.222 --> 02:51.857
and you're selling
the Poon-tang palace?

02:51.858 --> 02:54.893
- You've changed.
- What? No, I haven't.

02:54.894 --> 02:57.997
Yeah, prove it. I got a new
party drug called Stacey.

02:57.998 --> 03:00.699
- Let's take it.
- Peter, I'm 27 years old

03:00.700 --> 03:02.668
and I have a baby.
I can't do that.

03:02.669 --> 03:04.003
I understand but come on,
let's party.

03:04.004 --> 03:05.304
Okay, okay, we will.
We can go out tomorrow night.

03:05.305 --> 03:07.539
Yes, awesome! I'm sorry!

03:07.540 --> 03:09.875
It just feels like
my head's gonna explode.

03:09.876 --> 03:11.778
But that could be the Stacey.

03:17.150 --> 03:20.886
Hi.

03:20.887 --> 03:22.721
Welcome to the Mercer Street Club.
Can I help you?

03:22.722 --> 03:26.191
Hello, I was hoping to
hang my open house flyer

03:26.192 --> 03:28.627
in your exclusive
members-only club.

03:28.628 --> 03:30.029
You know,
so that a rich-o might see it.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.865
The community bulletin board
is for club members only.

03:32.866 --> 03:34.400
Well, I tried to become a member

03:34.401 --> 03:36.568
but your committee said
that my application was,

03:36.569 --> 03:38.370
"Covered in sauce."

03:38.371 --> 03:40.272
Ah, Mr. Smith. Welcome back.

03:40.273 --> 03:44.309
Hey, Denise. But one more time.
Mr. Smith is my father.

03:44.310 --> 03:47.513
Are you kidding me?
Kevin Smith is a member here?

03:47.514 --> 03:49.615
Holy... Mindy!

03:49.616 --> 03:51.350
Oh, my Lord,
are you a member here too?

03:51.351 --> 03:52.584
You're gonna love it, man.

03:52.585 --> 03:54.887
They got chicken fingers
with eight kinds of sauce,

03:54.888 --> 03:57.656
and the toilet seats are
huge for people like us.

03:57.657 --> 03:59.124
I don't need that.
I'm not... that's not...

03:59.125 --> 04:01.193
Fair enough. Between us.

04:01.194 --> 04:02.594
Okay, I don't know what
he's talking about.

04:02.595 --> 04:04.797
Please,
just let me hang this flyer up.

04:04.798 --> 04:06.598
To be honest, this is something
that my fiance would have

04:06.599 --> 04:08.600
taken care of,
but he's gone now,

04:08.601 --> 04:10.936
and I am just struggling
to keep it together,

04:10.937 --> 04:14.106
so... oh, great,
you called security.

04:14.107 --> 04:16.007
Very classy.
You know what, dude?

04:16.009 --> 04:17.875
My fiance has been
gone for three months,

04:17.877 --> 04:19.344
so if you're gonna
touch my arm like that,

04:19.345 --> 04:21.613
you better do it a lot more,
or way less.

04:21.613 --> 04:23.248
'Cause I am horny as hell.

04:23.249 --> 04:25.217
Listen, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

04:25.218 --> 04:28.187
No, I'm so sorry, sir.
She was just leaving.

04:28.188 --> 04:29.354
- Okay.
- No, no, no, no.

04:29.355 --> 04:31.623
I'm James and, um,

04:31.624 --> 04:33.892
actually I'm going through
the same thing you're going through.

04:33.893 --> 04:35.627
Oh. Your wife's gone too?

04:35.628 --> 04:38.063
Yeah, and it's been really,
really hard.

04:38.064 --> 04:40.399
Especially since all I want
to do is talk about her

04:40.400 --> 04:41.967
but nobody seems
to want to listen.

04:41.968 --> 04:45.003
Even my Uber driver asked if
we could just ride in silence.

04:45.004 --> 04:47.005
I know.
It's like, I'm going through this,

04:47.006 --> 04:48.674
and no one understands.

04:48.675 --> 04:52.611
Anyway, what can I do?
He's with his dad now.

04:52.612 --> 04:56.648
You know what? Denise, um,
I'm going to hang her flyer up.

04:56.649 --> 04:59.818
Actually, I was just here to
hang up something of my own.

04:59.819 --> 05:01.854
Thank you, James.

05:01.855 --> 05:03.856
No thank you, Denise.

05:03.857 --> 05:05.557
You know what? If you ever
want to feel black balled,

05:05.558 --> 05:07.593
just try to go to
the Weight Watchers in Tribeca.

05:07.594 --> 05:10.530
They'll turn you away
because you're way too thin.

05:13.032 --> 05:15.200
Well, look what I found.

05:15.201 --> 05:18.170
Tamra's got a music gig
she didn't tell us about.

05:18.171 --> 05:20.672
That's why she was too busy
to take out the medical waste.

05:20.673 --> 05:22.040
Where'd you even find that?

05:22.041 --> 05:23.976
At the CrossFit gym
my ex-girlfriend's

05:23.977 --> 05:25.344
ex-girlfriend owns.

05:25.345 --> 05:27.079
And people say stalking is bad.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.047
Tamra, look.
We'll come and support you.

05:29.048 --> 05:30.582
I had courtside Liberty tickets,

05:30.583 --> 05:32.317
but I can just eat
the two dollars.

05:32.318 --> 05:35.487
- Well, you guys aren't invited.
- What?

05:35.488 --> 05:37.723
And you can tell
Gordon I said...

05:37.724 --> 05:38.991
Whoa.

05:38.992 --> 05:41.927
- Why aren't we invited?
- I mean, look at us.

05:41.928 --> 05:45.831
We have such bad hair but for
completely different reasons.

05:45.832 --> 05:47.666
I guess one of us will just
stay here and deal with Gordon

05:47.667 --> 05:49.034
and the medical waste.

05:49.035 --> 05:50.402
No, it's not right.

05:50.403 --> 05:52.671
She can't tell us where
we can and cannot go.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.773
- Yeah.
- We're going to that show.

05:54.774 --> 05:57.242
- Yeah, we are.
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.243 --> 05:59.077
Can I borrow ten
bucks for a ticket?

05:59.078 --> 06:01.713
Jinx. You owe me a Coke.

06:01.714 --> 06:03.682
Jinx. You owe me two Cokes.

06:03.683 --> 06:05.450
Okay, I don't have
that kind of money.

06:05.451 --> 06:07.052
Peter, thank you
so much for helping me

06:07.053 --> 06:08.654
set up for this open house.

06:08.655 --> 06:10.455
I just don't understand why
you're selling this place.

06:10.456 --> 06:11.590
I mean, you said buying it was

06:11.591 --> 06:12.925
your single biggest
accomplishment

06:12.926 --> 06:15.260
besides touching
your toes that one time.

06:15.261 --> 06:17.296
Oh, well, Danny could never
live in this apartment.

06:17.297 --> 06:18.764
He says
that the gay neighborhood

06:18.765 --> 06:20.399
makes him feel too pretty.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.301
That's real shame.

06:22.302 --> 06:25.170
You know, this was the first
couch I ever made love to.

06:25.171 --> 06:26.171
- What?
- What?

06:27.173 --> 06:28.173
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

06:28.174 --> 06:29.174
Oh, my God, someone's here!

06:31.144 --> 06:33.912
Welcome to a home
as elegant as you are.

06:33.913 --> 06:35.180
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

06:35.181 --> 06:36.748
- Hello.
- You're James, right?

06:36.749 --> 06:37.816
- Mindy, right?
- Hello.

06:37.817 --> 06:38.984
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

06:38.985 --> 06:40.686
- I brought my friend Loretta.
- Hi.

06:40.687 --> 06:42.221
She's in the market
for a new place.

06:42.222 --> 06:45.357
Her townhome reminds her too
much of her late husband.

06:45.358 --> 06:48.627
Well, mostly because he asked
to be buried within its walls.

06:48.628 --> 06:49.995
My God.

06:49.996 --> 06:51.997
This place is so charming.

06:51.998 --> 06:55.500
Well, my friend Peter
will show you around.

06:55.501 --> 06:56.969
No, I'm working on this cookie.

06:56.970 --> 06:59.204
Drop the cookie, loser.
Be helpful for once in your life.

06:59.205 --> 07:02.474
Right this way.

07:02.475 --> 07:04.142
You know, it's such a shame.

07:04.143 --> 07:06.879
Mindy's too young
to suffer such loss.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.047
What, you mean her hair loss?

07:09.048 --> 07:11.783
She was bleaching it
blonde for awhile.

07:11.784 --> 07:15.721
No, I mean having her
fiance die so young.

07:15.722 --> 07:17.389
Who... wha?

07:17.390 --> 07:18.757
- It's pretty wa...
- Excuse me germs.

07:18.758 --> 07:20.792
Can I talk to you for
a second real quick?

07:20.793 --> 07:22.127
Oh, no.

07:22.128 --> 07:23.562
Did Loretta see that guy
masturbating across the street?

07:23.563 --> 07:24.663
Damn it!

07:24.664 --> 07:26.899
Mindy,
Loretta thinks Danny is dead.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.368
- What? How?
- I don't know.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.403
All I told James is
that I was doing this all alone

07:31.404 --> 07:33.372
because Danny was gone
and he's with his father.

07:33.373 --> 07:34.673
Son of a bitch.

07:34.674 --> 07:38.143
Good news, everybody.
Loretta wants the apartment.

07:38.144 --> 07:41.813
This is perfect.
We both need a fresh start, dear.

07:41.814 --> 07:43.749
There has been
a misunderstanding.

07:43.750 --> 07:47.252
I'd like to offer
you 10% over asking.

07:47.253 --> 07:50.606
The apartment is yours.
Do you hear that, Danny? Hallelujah.

07:54.872 --> 07:57.285
Mindy, I'm so glad that you
could sell your apartment

07:57.286 --> 07:58.620
to a fellow widow.

07:58.621 --> 08:00.555
It's nice that there's
some good that can come

08:00.556 --> 08:03.191
from Danny's...
I want to say, his accident.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.526
Oh, yeah.

08:04.527 --> 08:06.127
And Mindy,
I didn't want to seem too forward

08:06.128 --> 08:07.629
when we first met,

08:07.630 --> 08:10.632
but I think you should come to
our bereavement group tonight.

08:10.633 --> 08:13.635
I mean, it's just a safe space
where you can talk about loss.

08:13.636 --> 08:15.203
And we got desserts,
and they're good now

08:15.204 --> 08:17.939
that the gluten-free
widow is remarried.

08:17.940 --> 08:21.576
Amen. And I can bring
the deposit check.

08:21.577 --> 08:23.578
Well, I think that sounds great.
And fun.

08:23.579 --> 08:25.380
And sad, of course.

08:25.381 --> 08:28.516
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:28.517 --> 08:30.018
Mindy.

08:30.019 --> 08:31.986
You're joining a bereavement
group to sell your apartment?

08:31.987 --> 08:33.188
This is worse than when
you pretended to help

08:33.188 --> 08:34.456
in Hurricane Katrina
to get on the cover

08:34.457 --> 08:35.957
of your alumni magazine.

08:35.957 --> 08:38.760
Obviously I did not mean for
this to happen, Peter, okay?

08:38.760 --> 08:40.128
By the way,
when did you become morals police,

08:40.129 --> 08:42.831
- Upskirt King of New Hampshire?
- Hey.

08:42.832 --> 08:44.732
I'll have you know
that those upskirt shots

08:44.733 --> 08:46.701
are the reason I became
a gynecologist.

08:46.702 --> 08:48.036
And this isn't about me.

08:48.037 --> 08:49.938
What are you going to do
when they ask how Danny died?

08:49.939 --> 08:51.906
I will tell them
that he was a stunt double

08:51.907 --> 08:53.541
who died in
a motorcycle accident.

08:53.542 --> 08:56.311
Who would Danny be a stunt
double for? Anna Kendrick?

08:56.312 --> 08:58.079
This is wrong.
You need to fix it.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.715
Fine. I'll go to that meeting
tonight and I'll tell the truth.

09:00.716 --> 09:02.484
And I'll meet you
at a bar afterwards.

09:02.485 --> 09:03.551
How about I go with
you to make sure

09:03.552 --> 09:05.019
- you do the right thing?
- Damn it.

09:05.020 --> 09:06.054
Wasn't really going to do it.

09:06.055 --> 09:09.125
I know,
it was painfully obvious.

09:10.493 --> 09:12.193
Tamra was right.
These people are too cool for us.

09:12.194 --> 09:14.629
No one has complemented
my chili pepper shirt.

09:14.630 --> 09:16.397
- Hey, everybody.
- Whoo!

09:16.398 --> 09:18.399
I'm Tamra Webb, and once again

09:18.400 --> 09:21.069
I'm here to share a shard
of my shattered heart.

09:21.070 --> 09:23.872
Ooh!

09:26.642 --> 09:29.711

09:43.425 --> 09:46.261
Morgan, does that guy
sound familiar to you?

09:46.262 --> 09:47.662
He sounds like
a real lady-killer.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.946
- I got a gap in my tooth.
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.947 --> 10:07.383
- I got beady eyes.
- Yep.

10:09.084 --> 10:10.385
Get in there, tell the truth,

10:10.386 --> 10:11.786
and then we need to find a club

10:11.787 --> 10:12.887
that lets in uggos like us.

10:12.888 --> 10:14.289
I'm going it. Give me a second.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.124
- Hi, James.
- Hey, Mindy.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.158
Thanks so much for coming.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.593
Listen, before we get started,

10:18.594 --> 10:20.828
I've got some group business
that I want to go over

10:20.829 --> 10:21.996
very quickly.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.831
Gather around, please, come on.
Gather around.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.935
As you all know, I'm executive
creative director for Nike.

10:26.936 --> 10:28.436
- What?
- What's that now?

10:28.437 --> 10:31.973
And tonight I'll be co-hosting
a party with some NBA players

10:31.974 --> 10:34.309
and the Knicks City
Dancers and I'd be honored

10:34.310 --> 10:36.444
if I could have all
my bereavement group peeps

10:36.445 --> 10:37.612
as my special guests.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.714
- Oh, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

10:39.715 --> 10:41.216
Sure, great.

10:41.217 --> 10:44.752
And it looks like we have
some new faces to meet. Mindy?

10:44.753 --> 10:45.987
I have to confess.

10:45.988 --> 10:50.058
My name is Peter,
and my wife is dead too.

10:50.059 --> 10:54.059
♪ I still smell your
grandmother's house sometimes ♪

10:55.989 --> 11:00.131
♪ When I'm walking
by wet cardboard ♪

11:01.570 --> 11:03.171
She wasn't embarrassed of us.

11:03.172 --> 11:04.239
She was embarrassed
that I'd find out

11:04.240 --> 11:06.374
she's still madly
in love with me.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.976
What do I do, Colette?

11:07.977 --> 11:11.012
Wait until the show is over
and talk privately about it?

11:11.013 --> 11:14.515
Colette. Idiot.

11:14.516 --> 11:16.217
- Tamra.
- Oh, God.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.619
- Tam.
- Morgan.

11:17.620 --> 11:20.688
Excuse me, so sorry.
Tamra. Tamra.

11:20.689 --> 11:24.892
Everyone, I'm Morgan. I'm the damn
male nurse from the song.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.761
Morgan, stop it.
You don't know what you're doing.

11:26.762 --> 11:29.631
No, Tam,
for the first time in my life,

11:29.632 --> 11:31.099
I know exactly what I'm doing.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.668
Oh! Ah, my kneecap!

11:33.669 --> 11:35.903
Oh. Come on. Aah!

11:35.904 --> 11:37.239
Everything's breaking.

11:38.807 --> 11:40.575
Peter, how did your wife pass?

11:40.576 --> 11:42.944
If that's something
you'd like to share.

11:42.945 --> 11:45.280
My wife was a stunt woman,

11:45.281 --> 11:49.281
and she was tragically killed
on set in a motorcycle accident.

11:50.052 --> 11:52.920
Really?

11:52.921 --> 11:54.622
The saddest part
was that the scene

11:54.623 --> 11:57.358
never even made it
in to "The Intern."

11:57.359 --> 11:59.494
Wow. That is amazing.

11:59.495 --> 12:01.829
Now Mindy, do you have
anything you'd like to share?

12:01.830 --> 12:02.930
Nah, I'll pass.

12:02.931 --> 12:05.133
Well, everybody's gone already.

12:05.134 --> 12:07.168
I d... I don't... okay.

12:07.169 --> 12:10.872
Um, my fiance Danny

12:10.873 --> 12:12.840
died...

12:12.841 --> 12:13.875
on Everest.

12:13.876 --> 12:16.511
Oh, on what expedition?

12:16.512 --> 12:19.047
I teach Himalayan
studies at NYU.

12:19.048 --> 12:22.383
Oh, you do?
What a cool coincidence.

12:22.384 --> 12:24.185
Danny actually died
in the movie "Everest"

12:24.186 --> 12:27.221
which they shot in Toronto
for tax rebate reasons, so...

12:27.222 --> 12:28.389
I see.

12:28.390 --> 12:32.527
So both your spouses
died on movie sets?

12:32.528 --> 12:35.163
I guess that's true.
We never talked about that.

12:35.164 --> 12:37.265
I didn't even put
two and two together.

12:37.266 --> 12:40.768
You know, he was a sound guy
and he was holding his boom mic

12:40.769 --> 12:42.870
above Sam Worthington's head

12:42.871 --> 12:45.973
when a giant eagle
flew out of nowhere

12:45.974 --> 12:48.710
and just wrapped his talons
around the microphone.

12:48.711 --> 12:50.712
He would not let go
of that boom mic.

12:50.713 --> 12:51.713
And they say he just disappeared

12:51.714 --> 12:52.980
off into the horizon.

12:52.981 --> 12:55.850
Look, I know that it
sounds implausible,

12:55.851 --> 12:58.086
but he wasn't a very big man.

12:58.087 --> 12:59.887
This is him.

12:59.888 --> 13:03.888
Oh, you must miss him so much.

13:04.693 --> 13:08.663
I do, actually.
I think about him constantly.

13:08.664 --> 13:09.997
Every night when
I walk into my apartment

13:09.998 --> 13:12.700
I think he's going to be there,
but he's not.

13:12.701 --> 13:15.336
It's actually been really
nice talking about it here.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.638
Well, thanks,
Mindy, for sharing.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.140
So Cheryl.

13:19.141 --> 13:21.876
Still carrying around Dwayne's
ashes with you everywhere?

13:21.877 --> 13:23.711
Ho, shit just got real.

13:23.712 --> 13:26.280
What the hell are you doing?

13:26.281 --> 13:27.882
I told you not to come to this.

13:27.883 --> 13:31.052
I know, I know,
but now you're glad that I did

13:31.053 --> 13:34.255
and we're together
again and I just...

13:34.256 --> 13:37.091
Get off me.
Your breath smells like metal.

13:37.092 --> 13:39.327
You just sung about
my breath in "Metal Breath."

13:39.328 --> 13:40.528
I thought it was good.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.797
No, Morgan, It's all fake.

13:42.798 --> 13:44.699
I'm just using
the details of our breakup

13:44.700 --> 13:47.835
to be more relatable.
Like Taylor Swift does.

13:47.836 --> 13:49.237
Poor Taylor Swift.

13:49.238 --> 13:50.438
When I think about what these
creeps have done to her...

13:50.439 --> 13:52.840
See? Taylor Swift's a genius.

13:52.841 --> 13:55.209
She's a rich,
white model and even your poor ass

13:55.210 --> 13:58.045
feels bad for her because
she sings about getting dumped,

13:58.046 --> 13:59.514
and that's what I have to do.

13:59.515 --> 14:01.015
I tried singing about
how I can't gain weight

14:01.016 --> 14:02.784
no matter how much I eat
and I got straight up

14:02.785 --> 14:04.118
hit with a tomato.

14:04.119 --> 14:05.553
You know what? You're right.

14:05.554 --> 14:08.322
Why would a perfect ten like you
be in love with someone like me?

14:08.323 --> 14:11.392
I'm just a nine.
Nine and a half.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.794
I'm sorry to ruin your show.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.529
- Hey, I got some...
- I don't want the water.

14:14.530 --> 14:18.766
It's from the sink.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.502
Hey, it's fine when Taylor
Swift does what you're doing,

14:21.503 --> 14:23.337
because the guys
she dates are monsters

14:23.338 --> 14:25.339
who deserve to be
taken down a peg,

14:25.340 --> 14:28.342
but Morgan,
he doesn't have any pegs.

14:28.343 --> 14:30.511
That's actually
a good idea for a song.

14:30.512 --> 14:32.547
Listen, I'm going to
tell you what you told me

14:32.548 --> 14:35.450
when I sat down on
that couch full of bed bugs.

14:35.451 --> 14:38.986

15:01.477 --> 15:03.578
Okay, look.
Just shoot it nice and easy.

15:03.579 --> 15:07.579
Okay. Nice and...

15:08.150 --> 15:09.817
- Oh, no.
- You did your best, Peter.

15:09.818 --> 15:12.954
I bet your wife is just
smiling down on you right now.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.755
Thanks, guys. Come on, Mindy.

15:14.756 --> 15:17.059
They're about to put
me over their head.

15:22.764 --> 15:26.764
Oh, my God. Kate Middleto... ah.

15:27.135 --> 15:30.086
Whoa. He's eating
a sundae with Tiger Woods.

15:33.035 --> 15:36.844
Hey, babe! I'm at this cool party!
Isn't that 100?!

15:36.845 --> 15:38.980
Hey, you feeling okay?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.615
You're missing
a great party out there.

15:40.616 --> 15:41.849
I don't think Danny
would mind you doing

15:41.850 --> 15:44.719
keg stands with Apolo Ohno, huh?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.455
- Apolo Ohno is here?
- Yeah, look at him go.

15:47.456 --> 15:49.991
Oh, he's my favorite
mixed-race celebrity.

15:49.992 --> 15:54.328
God, James, you know
so many cool and famous people.

15:54.329 --> 15:56.197
One time Julianne Moore ran
over me with her skateboard.

15:56.198 --> 15:58.032
Highlight of my 2012.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.734
You know, she and I used
to date back in the day.

15:59.735 --> 16:01.035
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

16:01.036 --> 16:04.071
Broke up with her
and she bit me.

16:04.072 --> 16:06.340
- I have to tell you something.
- Mm-hmm.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.043
I shouldn't be part of
your bereavement group anymore.

16:09.044 --> 16:10.912
I haven't been totally
honest with you.

16:10.913 --> 16:12.513
- I know.
- You do?

16:12.514 --> 16:15.317
I feel the same way.

16:20.519 --> 16:22.487
Mm, mm, okay.
Okay, okay, no, no, no, no, no.

16:22.488 --> 16:23.821
We cannot do that. No.

16:23.822 --> 16:26.357
Well, look, I mean,
we're allowed to love again.

16:26.358 --> 16:28.826
My fiance is not dead.

16:28.827 --> 16:31.195
- Not dead.
- He's in California.

16:31.196 --> 16:33.765
I made the whole thing up.
Except that he is tiny.

16:33.766 --> 16:35.433
That part is true. I'm so sorry.

16:35.434 --> 16:37.402
- I'm gonna go.
- Wait, I don't under...

16:37.403 --> 16:39.637
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, wait one second.

16:39.638 --> 16:42.674
You lied to us?
Why would you lie?

16:42.675 --> 16:44.075
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

16:44.076 --> 16:48.076
Was this some sob story
so you could sell your apartment?

16:49.081 --> 16:50.214
Yeah, a little bit.

16:50.215 --> 16:52.850
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.019
I'm going to tell
my husband to haunt you.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.921
Have you ever seen
a Hispanic ghost?

16:56.922 --> 17:00.925
- No.
- Well, you're gonna.

17:00.926 --> 17:02.360
Okay, listen. I'm very sorry.

17:02.361 --> 17:05.930
I'm just so lonely and it
was nice to have some people

17:05.931 --> 17:08.733
who actually wanted
to listen to me.

17:08.733 --> 17:12.502
Peter, let's go. The jig is up.

17:12.503 --> 17:15.440
How could she do this to us?
We're grieving.

17:15.441 --> 17:16.641
Are you serious?

17:16.642 --> 17:18.509
I'm as serious
as the motorcycle accident

17:18.510 --> 17:21.079
that claimed my wife's life
on the set of "The Intern."

17:21.079 --> 17:22.847
Okay.

17:22.848 --> 17:24.882
Well, I guess
I'll leave by myself.

17:24.883 --> 17:27.318
One day I think we're
gonna look back on this

17:27.319 --> 17:28.386
and we're gonna laugh.

17:28.387 --> 17:31.422
I have never seen
anything so shameful

17:31.423 --> 17:34.225
and I come from the combined
worlds of corporate finance

17:34.226 --> 17:36.662
and professional sports.

17:40.165 --> 17:41.633
How was the rest of the concert?

17:41.634 --> 17:43.534
You didn't miss much.
I ended up making out

17:43.535 --> 17:47.038
with the headliner,
but then I had to buy her CD.

17:47.039 --> 17:49.007
Sounds like you two had
a delightful evening.

17:49.008 --> 17:50.875
- We did.
- Yeah, I'd love you to show me

17:50.876 --> 17:52.877
- some photos on Facebook.
- Okay.

17:52.878 --> 17:54.178
Oh, hold on a second,
you can't...

17:54.179 --> 17:57.015
because someone stole
all of our computers.

17:57.016 --> 17:58.783
I mean,
if you want to see photos

17:58.784 --> 17:59.917
I have 'em on my phone right...

17:59.918 --> 18:01.853
I don't want to see photos,
Colette!

18:01.854 --> 18:03.588
- Easy.
- Whoa!

18:03.589 --> 18:06.524
Apparently, instead of meeting
Gordon the waste removal guy

18:06.525 --> 18:09.227
here last night,
someone just propped open the door

18:09.228 --> 18:11.896
and left a note saying,
"Gordon, do your thing.

18:11.897 --> 18:14.465
Please lock up,
no one is here to watch you."

18:14.466 --> 18:16.467
Why would Gordon
want our computers?

18:16.468 --> 18:18.236
He already tried to sell me
a trunk full of computers

18:18.237 --> 18:21.105
last week. Oh.

18:21.106 --> 18:23.608
- So, who's gonna fess up?
- I did it, Dr. Reed.

18:23.609 --> 18:25.576
I was supposed to
meet Gordon last night

18:25.577 --> 18:27.345
and I blew it off
for my music gig.

18:27.346 --> 18:28.613
Tamra...

18:28.614 --> 18:30.615
From now on you shall
have to personally escort

18:30.616 --> 18:32.684
all the medical waste
to the toxin barge

18:32.685 --> 18:35.313
in the Gowanus Canal.
And that is my decree.

18:37.456 --> 18:38.956
Hey.

18:38.957 --> 18:40.758
I can help.
I know that canal real well.

18:40.759 --> 18:41.959
I get all my sweatshirts
out of there.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.961
Nah, it's okay. I'll do it.

18:43.962 --> 18:46.497
I've taken advantage of you
and Colette long enough.

18:46.498 --> 18:48.332
Tam, I was wrong last night.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.369
We're both 10s.

18:51.870 --> 18:53.471
Wow, Tamra,
that was a pretty cool thing

18:53.472 --> 18:55.506
to do for a guy you
don't care about at all.

18:55.507 --> 18:58.109
Yeah, it was cool 'cause
I barely think about him

18:58.110 --> 18:59.712
all the time.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.349
Hey, Mindy,
what happened to you last night?

19:05.350 --> 19:07.018
You didn't say good-bye
after I betrayed you.

19:07.019 --> 19:09.320
Were you out partying
for 24 hours straight?

19:09.321 --> 19:12.690
Those basketball players,
they can drink

19:12.691 --> 19:14.392
'cause they're so tall.

19:16.695 --> 19:17.862
Excuse me.

19:17.863 --> 19:19.831
What kind of Sand-o
you got rocking here?

19:19.832 --> 19:22.066
- Don't touch that.
- Too late.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.835
Lauren? What are you doing here?

19:23.836 --> 19:25.603
Hey, my wife.

19:25.604 --> 19:27.004
Hey, here's something weird.

19:27.005 --> 19:28.606
Look what I found
online last night.

19:28.607 --> 19:30.975
Apparently, I'm dead.
There's a scholarship

19:30.976 --> 19:32.844
in my name at Tulane now,
so that's nice.

19:32.845 --> 19:35.146
That is very nice.
That's a positive thing.

19:35.147 --> 19:36.881
- Hi. I love you.
- Hi. Uh-huh.

19:36.882 --> 19:38.616
What happened was...

19:38.617 --> 19:40.351
Mindy was pretending
that Danny was dead

19:40.352 --> 19:42.019
- so she could sell the apartment.
- Oh, Mindy and Danny.

19:42.020 --> 19:43.387
Of course. Well, that figures.

19:43.388 --> 19:44.856
Huh? What figures?

19:44.857 --> 19:46.891
I think what Lauren's
trying to say is that

19:46.892 --> 19:49.660
you guys have, like, a...
chaotic dynamic, you know?

19:49.661 --> 19:52.130
Like a storm,
it sucks everybody in

19:52.131 --> 19:54.232
that's around it...
I'm not helping.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.902
I'm sorry, do you think
that we have a bad relationship?

19:57.903 --> 19:59.904
No, that's not what I'm saying.

19:59.905 --> 20:01.906
I mean, Peter has said that,

20:01.907 --> 20:03.741
but, you know,
lots of people have.

20:03.742 --> 20:05.443
Yeah, please,
they're just jealous

20:05.444 --> 20:07.879
because Danny
and I are Couple of the Year.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.247
On the cover of
"Scientific American"

20:09.248 --> 20:12.049
and "Hustler."

20:12.050 --> 20:15.052
Then where is he?

20:15.053 --> 20:17.123
Peter,
I'm gonna wait downstairs.

20:19.925 --> 20:22.560
Do you really think that Danny
and I have a bad relationship?

20:22.561 --> 20:25.897
- No. Not always. I just...
- Why didn't you tell me that?

20:25.898 --> 20:28.065
- You're my friend!
- I don't know.

20:28.066 --> 20:30.301
I mean...

20:30.302 --> 20:33.104
maybe 'cause you let
him call all the shots,

20:33.105 --> 20:34.772
you moving in to his apartment,

20:34.773 --> 20:36.340
you're selling
your sweet-ass place,

20:36.341 --> 20:38.142
you're raising
your son Catholic,

20:38.143 --> 20:40.945
and then Danny ditches you
and now he's not telling you

20:40.946 --> 20:42.613
- when he's coming back?
- Okay, yes.

20:42.614 --> 20:45.016
When you say it like that,
it's very damning,

20:45.017 --> 20:48.286
but that's only because Danny
is the one in our relationship

20:48.287 --> 20:49.720
- that makes all the decisions.
- Uh-huh.

20:49.721 --> 20:52.157
And then I kind
of abide by them.

20:54.293 --> 20:56.627
Look, I'm in
a relationship with someone

20:56.628 --> 20:59.764
who controls everything
and I like it that way.

20:59.765 --> 21:01.265
I need it that way.

21:01.266 --> 21:03.334
If I wasn't with Lauren,
I'd weigh 300 pounds

21:03.335 --> 21:05.102
and literally
masturbate constantly.

21:05.103 --> 21:06.304
God.

21:06.305 --> 21:08.105
You don't need a babysitter.

21:08.106 --> 21:10.426
You don't need to be
the Peter of your relationship.

21:12.611 --> 21:16.113
Oh, God, Peter,
when did this happen?

21:16.114 --> 21:19.083
I don't know.
I'm sorry to drop truth bombs

21:19.084 --> 21:22.620
on you and then ghost,
but Lauren's waiting.

21:22.621 --> 21:25.623
I picked something up for
you last night at the party.

21:25.624 --> 21:28.459
I saw these
and they reminded me of you.

21:28.460 --> 21:30.862
They are bold, tough,

21:30.863 --> 21:32.563
and totally
inappropriate for work.

21:32.564 --> 21:34.866
Cool.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.168
Don't go back to Texas.

21:37.169 --> 21:39.403
Buddy, I gots to.
