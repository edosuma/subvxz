♪

00:03.501 --> 00:05.501
(crowd cheering)

00:09.073 --> 00:10.940
I think I've really
outdone myself

00:10.942 --> 00:12.675
this St. Patrick's Day.

00:12.677 --> 00:14.693
Check it: As the
float glides down

00:14.696 --> 00:17.063
Michigan Avenue, the
leaves are gonna undulate,

00:17.065 --> 00:18.181
symbolizing change,

00:18.183 --> 00:20.016
but they move in a
discordant fashion,

00:20.018 --> 00:21.951
because real change
is never gonna come...

00:21.953 --> 00:23.286
Wow.

00:23.288 --> 00:24.237
That's really gonna make

00:24.239 --> 00:25.822
an impact with the drunks

00:25.824 --> 00:26.890
on the parade route.

00:26.892 --> 00:28.825
How is that gonna
be ready in two days?

00:28.827 --> 00:30.043
I've got a crack team
of artisans

00:30.045 --> 00:31.094
working around the clock on it.

00:31.096 --> 00:32.662
And by "artisans,"
you mean interns?

00:32.664 --> 00:34.380
Your word. And yes.

00:34.382 --> 00:35.999
SIMON: Good morning, campers.
Oh! Clover down!

00:36.001 --> 00:37.167
Hide the float! ANDREW: Gentle!

00:37.169 --> 00:38.568
She's delicate.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.719
So why are we gathering?
Did someone on

00:39.721 --> 00:41.070
<i>Downton Abbey</i>
overstep their bounds?

00:41.072 --> 00:42.255
Mosley is in debt.
Ooh, well...

00:42.257 --> 00:43.539
I will applaud your
discretion when you leave.

00:43.541 --> 00:45.208
(Dowager voice): I am now caught
up to speed. Thank you.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.693
Spoiler alert:
We have the fifth

00:46.695 --> 00:48.344
round of auditions
for Krispy Kreme today.

00:48.346 --> 00:49.729
We are going to find
that spokeswoman.

00:49.731 --> 00:51.214
Yeah, how hard
can it be to find

00:51.216 --> 00:52.932
a hot, skinny girl who
believably loves donuts?

00:52.934 --> 00:54.317
SIMON: True. Time
to get it on, guys.

00:54.319 --> 00:56.653
Andrew, Zach, my office.

00:57.521 --> 00:59.388
("Danny Boy" begins playing)

00:59.390 --> 01:00.240
Is that...

01:00.242 --> 01:01.858
No. No. No...

01:01.860 --> 01:03.026
No, no, come on, guys.

01:03.028 --> 01:04.244
(Irish accent):
I know that's "Danny Boy."

01:04.245 --> 01:05.245
You don't have to hide

01:05.247 --> 01:06.613
St. Patrick's Day
from me.

01:06.615 --> 01:08.414
- We don't?
- No, no!

01:08.416 --> 01:09.749
Why would I have a problem

01:09.751 --> 01:11.451
with a holiday that
turns this entire town

01:11.453 --> 01:12.602
into a drunken frat party?

01:12.604 --> 01:14.420
Where a man can't
walk three feet

01:14.422 --> 01:15.922
without someone
vomiting green beer

01:15.924 --> 01:17.290
on his new Tod's driving mocs?

01:17.292 --> 01:18.925
Where you're asked to
kiss someone based on

01:18.927 --> 01:20.543
their ethnicity,
which is racist.

01:20.545 --> 01:21.928
Oh, so you don't like
St. Patrick's Day.

01:21.930 --> 01:23.146
Oh, no, I used to love it

01:23.148 --> 01:25.014
when I was drinking.
I also used to carry around

01:25.016 --> 01:26.582
a badger named Bob,
because I thought that was cool.

01:26.584 --> 01:27.884
Okay... We were
just talking about

01:27.886 --> 01:30.186
- the charity float.
- Ah, the charity float.

01:30.188 --> 01:32.188
And what's the theme this year,
Slumlords Without Borders?

01:32.190 --> 01:33.606
Actually, we got
a good one this year.

01:33.608 --> 01:34.607
No, no need.
Please.

01:34.609 --> 01:35.758
No, come on, now.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.143
You guys just carry on
with your festivities.

01:37.145 --> 01:39.062
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office

01:39.064 --> 01:41.481
trying to stick a shillelagh
where the sun don't shine.

01:41.483 --> 01:43.616
(chuckles)

01:44.451 --> 01:45.718
Okay, so I was gonna

01:45.720 --> 01:46.903
paint shamrocks on my face,

01:46.905 --> 01:48.538
but I-I think
I'll hold off.

01:48.540 --> 01:49.989
That's good,
because he hates it.

01:49.991 --> 01:51.241
I... I try really hard

01:51.243 --> 01:53.042
to protect him from all this,

01:53.044 --> 01:54.244
so everyone, remember:

01:54.246 --> 01:56.129
no mention of
St. Patrick's Day.

01:56.131 --> 01:57.247
Okay.

Why didn't you tell us
the new parade route

02:33.985 --> 02:35.418
goes right in front
of your building?

02:35.420 --> 02:36.953
We're going to hang out with you
while we stake our spot.

02:36.955 --> 02:39.005
For two whole days? You
know, this place is great.

02:39.007 --> 02:40.156
How come we've never been here?

02:40.158 --> 02:41.708
Yeah, well, we get
really busy around here.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.092
You should've called.

02:43.094 --> 02:44.627
- This might not be the best time...
- Hey, Andy,

02:44.629 --> 02:46.212
where's the bunny going?
I don't know.

02:46.214 --> 02:47.597
Ow! SISTERS: Oh!

02:47.599 --> 02:48.798
Every time!

02:48.800 --> 02:51.968
Ah, these must be the
famous Keaneally sisters.

02:51.970 --> 02:54.504
Yeah, let me introduce
them in order of DUls.

02:54.506 --> 02:57.173
We got Katherine, Elaine,
Eileen, Ellen, Helen and Molly.

02:57.175 --> 02:58.241
Well, that's a mouthful.

02:58.243 --> 02:59.942
I'll show you a mouthful.

02:59.944 --> 03:03.730
So who's this slab of Blue
Ribbon USDA Prime filet, huh?

03:03.732 --> 03:04.814
(giggles)

03:04.816 --> 03:05.815
Did I just giggle?

03:05.817 --> 03:06.783
Uh, I'm Zachary.

03:06.785 --> 03:08.735
And, uh,
I-I'm Sydney.

03:08.737 --> 03:11.404
The one who's too good to
go out with our Andy. Huh.

03:11.406 --> 03:12.739
Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.

03:12.741 --> 03:14.023
Hey, Sydney.

03:14.025 --> 03:14.957
Where's the bunny going?

03:14.959 --> 03:16.826
ANDREW:
Okay. No, no.

03:16.828 --> 03:18.995
She's my boss, she's my boss.
Thank you.

03:18.997 --> 03:20.213
Uh, it was
a-a pleasure

03:20.215 --> 03:22.531
meeting you guys.

03:22.533 --> 03:23.549
Who's that?
Andrew's sisters.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.834
ANDREW:
Oh, my God.

03:24.836 --> 03:26.035
Here comes my boss.
Cover up, cover up.

03:26.037 --> 03:27.870
Why? Nobody mention St.
Patrick's Day,

03:27.872 --> 03:29.673
all right? What the hell
are you talking about?

03:29.674 --> 03:30.773
It's your favorite holiday!

03:30.775 --> 03:31.774
Not today, it's not.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.176
Andrew, are these your sisters,

03:33.178 --> 03:35.645
or is there a supermodel
convention in town? SISTERS: Oh!

03:35.647 --> 03:37.480
That's good, that's nice,

03:37.482 --> 03:38.715
but we're-we're not supermodels,

03:38.717 --> 03:40.149
we're just
grade-school teachers.

03:40.151 --> 03:41.818
Just grade-school teachers?
Come on!

03:41.820 --> 03:42.985
(laughing)

03:42.987 --> 03:44.787
They're hilarious,
but they are leaving.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.105
No, don't leave!
Make yourselves at home!

03:46.107 --> 03:47.323
(quietly): Don't make
yourselves at home.

03:47.325 --> 03:49.525
Mi oficina <i>es su oficina.</i>

03:49.527 --> 03:52.028
<i>Oh, gracias por</i>
<i>su hospitalidad.</i>

03:52.030 --> 03:53.729
I only know oficina.

03:53.731 --> 03:54.797
He only knows <i>oficina.</i>

03:54.799 --> 03:56.916
So what brings you
beauties to town, eh?

03:56.918 --> 04:00.670
Oh, well, that jagbag
says we can't stay, so...

04:00.672 --> 04:03.172
The St. Patrick's
Day Parade!

04:03.174 --> 04:05.858
Our favorite holiday!
Oh... wow, wow!

04:05.860 --> 04:07.343
Yeah, thanks for
the home base, Simon.

04:07.345 --> 04:08.511
Where do you keep your snacks?

04:08.513 --> 04:10.046
Way on the other
side of the office.

04:10.048 --> 04:11.597
Out of sight, out of mind. Okay.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.799
Here we go.
Let's go.

04:12.801 --> 04:13.966
Bye!

04:13.968 --> 04:15.852
Molly, bring the beer!

04:15.854 --> 04:17.570
We don't want anyone to take it.

04:17.572 --> 04:19.305
Great.

04:19.307 --> 04:20.640
They're really settling in.

04:20.642 --> 04:22.358
("Danny Boy" plays)

04:24.645 --> 04:26.813
Wonderful.

04:33.371 --> 04:34.355
Krispy Kreme.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.639
They're cool when they're hot.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.408
- That was terrific.
- Thank you.

04:37.410 --> 04:38.826
You nailed it.
Amazing.

04:38.828 --> 04:40.327
I hated her.

04:40.329 --> 04:41.629
Did you?

04:41.631 --> 04:43.364
She did go to Julliard.
Thank God we have

04:43.366 --> 04:44.565
another round
of auditions tomorrow.

04:44.567 --> 04:47.134
Look, Roger, I'm not
trying to rush you,

04:47.136 --> 04:48.752
but we do shoot this
campaign in two days.

04:48.754 --> 04:49.837
How hard is it

04:49.839 --> 04:51.488
to find the perfect woman?

04:51.490 --> 04:53.007
I told you guys,

04:53.009 --> 04:54.491
I want the total package.

04:54.493 --> 04:56.544
Mm-hmm. Okay, well,
the perfect woman,

04:56.546 --> 04:58.596
total package thing
doesn't really exist.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.264
I mean, you know,
what if we tried

05:00.266 --> 05:01.682
to maybe appeal to everyone?

05:01.684 --> 05:02.833
Yep.
Take a page

05:02.835 --> 05:04.468
from Dove's
"Campaign for Real Beauty,"

05:04.470 --> 05:06.387
where they used women
of all shapes, sizes, colors.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.190
It was scary at first,
but then we got used to it

05:09.192 --> 05:10.774
and it was great.

05:10.776 --> 05:11.892
Normal women.

05:11.894 --> 05:12.943
Mm-hmm. ANDREW: Yeah.

05:12.945 --> 05:15.529
That is interesting.

05:16.481 --> 05:19.650
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

05:19.652 --> 05:21.485
Did I have...?

05:21.487 --> 05:22.736
Did I eat a prop again?

05:22.738 --> 05:24.021
Because that tasted real.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.323
Why don't you try
and say the line?

05:26.325 --> 05:27.541
Me?
Her?

05:27.543 --> 05:29.326
Yeah.
She's cute normal, right?

05:29.328 --> 05:31.361
Um, well...

05:31.363 --> 05:33.497
while it's flattering
to be called "normal""

05:33.499 --> 05:35.199
um, I-I'm not
an actress.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.251
I wouldn't even know
how to say...

05:37.253 --> 05:38.586
Krispy Kreme...

05:38.588 --> 05:39.737
They're cool when they're hot.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.889
Wow. <i>Wow.</i>

05:41.891 --> 05:43.257
You know what?

05:43.259 --> 05:44.358
That's it.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.227
I think we found our new
Krispy Kreme Girl!

05:46.229 --> 05:48.045
I'm gonna go ahead
and agree with you.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.213
I'm on board with you. Yeah?

05:49.215 --> 05:50.431
Wait, you guys, this is crazy.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.433
I'm the creative director

05:51.434 --> 05:53.083
of this agency.
Mm-hmm.

05:53.085 --> 05:54.718
Although I did do some
commercial work as a child.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.104
Okay, I guess, you know,
what the client wants,

05:57.106 --> 05:58.388
the client wants, right?

05:58.390 --> 05:59.740
I'll just go...

05:59.742 --> 06:02.559
cancel tomorrow's
round of auditions.

06:02.561 --> 06:03.994
This is nuts.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.029
Mmm.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.113
She was...
she was great, right?

06:06.115 --> 06:07.831
She feels great.
I-I-I love her.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.766
She feels great.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.167
Here's your coffees, fellas.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.285
Can't have donuts

06:11.287 --> 06:12.336
without coffee.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.337
Krispy Kreme.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.705
They're cool when they're hot.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.956
(Lauren laughs)

06:15.958 --> 06:17.942
No, no, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, <i>that's</i> her.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.010
That's the total package.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.262
That's what I'm talking about!

06:21.264 --> 06:22.346
I love her!

06:22.348 --> 06:24.048
I hated that whole
"normal" thing.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.766
Huh?
Congratulations.

06:25.768 --> 06:28.085
Oh... You are our new
Krispy Kreme Girl.

06:28.087 --> 06:30.437
You're telling Sydney.
I am not telling her.

06:30.439 --> 06:31.605
Thank you!

06:32.880 --> 06:34.441
(Irish accent):
Oh! Top o' the afternoon

06:34.443 --> 06:36.093
- to ya, Simon.
- You, too, missy.

06:36.095 --> 06:37.695
- Quick tip...
- SIMON: Uh-huh?

06:37.697 --> 06:39.863
If you run out of tape,
you can always use gum.

06:39.865 --> 06:40.814
Wow.

06:40.816 --> 06:41.899
Even on imported
Venezuelan teak?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.284
Isn't that a neat
tip there, Andrew?

06:43.286 --> 06:44.868
Hey, hey, hey, guys...

06:44.870 --> 06:46.103
Uh, thing is, we don't really

06:46.105 --> 06:47.655
celebrate St. Patrick's Day
up here in the office.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.657
It's kind of taboo.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.609
Like, you know, talking about
Cousin Bill's secret family.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.928
Oh, those kids have
such beautiful skin...

06:53.930 --> 06:55.229
like caramel.

06:55.231 --> 06:57.097
I wouldn't really
say it's... taboo!

06:57.099 --> 06:58.415
I got you!
(laughs)

06:58.417 --> 06:59.616
You're not wearing green.

06:59.618 --> 07:00.884
It's a pinch for the Grinch!

07:00.886 --> 07:01.969
You sure got me, all right!

07:01.971 --> 07:02.953
I think you struck bone!

07:02.955 --> 07:04.288
I was due for a prostate exam.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.422
What a fun tradition!

07:05.424 --> 07:07.958
No wonder you don't
have an ass, Andrew.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.426
I am so sorry about my sisters.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.661
I crack myself up.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.179
SIMON:
Pardon me, ladies.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.297
Coming through.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.832
Thank you, no, thank you.

07:14.834 --> 07:15.816
It's S-Simon Roboto.

07:15.818 --> 07:18.135
Simon Roboto, Simon Roboto...

07:18.820 --> 07:19.820
Sydney!

07:19.822 --> 07:20.821
Sydney.

07:20.823 --> 07:21.939
Oh, Dad! Look what I found.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.307
The craziest thing happened.
You are never

07:23.309 --> 07:24.858
going to believe it.
W... why are you a robot?

07:24.860 --> 07:26.076
(whispering):
Come closer to the screen.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.211
It's the sisters.

07:27.213 --> 07:28.796
They're a lot to take.

07:28.798 --> 07:29.980
They're so gropey,

07:29.982 --> 07:31.348
and you know I bruise
like a Bartlett pear.

07:31.350 --> 07:32.700
But, Dad, if they're
bothering you, I'll just

07:32.702 --> 07:34.168
ask them to leave.
No, no, no, we can't.

07:34.170 --> 07:35.369
They're the only thing
worse than family.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.420
They're other people's family.

07:36.422 --> 07:37.538
(shudders)

07:37.540 --> 07:38.589
So what's the good news, kiddo?

07:38.591 --> 07:40.074
The client wants me to be

07:40.076 --> 07:41.375
the new Krispy Kreme Girl!

07:41.377 --> 07:42.926
You are?
Yeah.

07:42.928 --> 07:44.428
Shut up.
Sign my boob.

07:44.430 --> 07:45.546
Whoa.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.730
SYDNEY: For real?
ELAINE: Yeah.

07:46.732 --> 07:47.798
Whoa, whoa.
Okay.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.516
No. Gotta go.

07:50.535 --> 07:53.020
Okay. So just-just go
in there and tell her.

07:53.022 --> 07:54.021
No, you tell her.

07:54.023 --> 07:55.105
No, you tell her.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.156
Somebody tell me.

07:56.158 --> 07:57.558
Oh, my God, can she hear us?

07:57.560 --> 07:58.642
Could she always hear us?

07:58.644 --> 08:00.110
What about when we made
fun of her side bun?

08:00.112 --> 08:01.395
Could she hear us then?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.230
You notice I don't wear
that side bun anymore, right?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.616
What do you want?

08:05.618 --> 08:07.067
Syd!
How's it going today?

08:07.069 --> 08:09.286
Hey, what do you... we didn't
know you were in here.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.520
My gosh.
(chuckles)

08:10.522 --> 08:12.323
Um, Andrew wanted to
tell you something.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.575
See, Syd, donut thinking
is often circular.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.909
Sydney, did you hear?

08:15.911 --> 08:17.878
I'm going to be
the new Krispy Kreme Girl!

08:18.630 --> 08:19.813
Really?

08:19.815 --> 08:20.881
Yeah!
See, uh...

08:20.883 --> 08:22.366
Syd, they wanted to go back

08:22.368 --> 08:24.551
to that total package thing,
and, obviously, that's just...

08:24.553 --> 08:26.170
I really wouldn't go there.
Let's not stir up her jealousy.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.154
We don't want a cat fight.

08:27.156 --> 08:28.555
Unless it leads to
a make-out session,

08:28.557 --> 08:30.641
which they always
do. Always.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.509
Guys, I am not jealous. Okay?

08:32.510 --> 08:33.594
It's whatever the client wants.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.711
They went in
a different direction,

08:34.712 --> 08:35.729
I get it.

08:35.731 --> 08:37.313
Oh, wait, they were
gonna use you?

08:37.316 --> 08:38.315
Lauren, it's not a big deal.

08:38.317 --> 08:39.316
I'm thrilled for you.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.601
Really?

08:40.602 --> 08:42.653
Because I wanted to ask
you some pointers, you know,

08:42.655 --> 08:44.270
since you did all those
brownie commercials.

08:44.273 --> 08:45.656
Cookies, actually.
Uh...

08:45.658 --> 08:46.740
I mean, I-I don't
personally care,

08:46.742 --> 08:47.691
but I wouldn't want to diminish

08:47.693 --> 08:48.909
the accomplishments
of the baker.

08:48.911 --> 08:50.110
Right.

08:50.112 --> 08:52.329
I'm so happy for you!

08:52.331 --> 08:53.614
Thanks.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.500
Good meeting.
Okay.

08:56.502 --> 08:57.501
That was good.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.786
I think it went well.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.921
Not much of a catfight.

09:01.923 --> 09:04.241
Hey, guys...
guess what time it is.

09:04.243 --> 09:05.509
It's beer o'clock!

09:05.511 --> 09:07.294
(cheering)

09:07.296 --> 09:08.578
That's what I'm talking about!

09:08.580 --> 09:11.432
We need to relocate this party
away from my robo-dad.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.516
They don't listen to me.

09:12.518 --> 09:14.351
Don't worry.
I got this.

09:14.353 --> 09:15.552
Hey, no way are you

09:15.554 --> 09:17.438
beautiful ladies drinking here.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.772
I'm taking you out tonight

09:18.774 --> 09:20.424
to party Chicago-style!

09:20.426 --> 09:22.359
(cheering) Let's do it!

09:22.361 --> 09:23.894
Time to get this party started!

09:23.896 --> 09:24.895
I'll go ask Simon.

09:24.897 --> 09:25.946
No!
Nope.

09:25.948 --> 09:26.947
Well...

09:26.949 --> 09:28.632
my dad's an alcoholic.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.784
Ooh, those guys are the
most fun to drink with.

09:30.786 --> 09:32.069
Not this one.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.704
Why don't you gals
pre-party in the break room,

09:33.706 --> 09:34.988
and we'll meet you
there in a bit? Huh?

09:34.990 --> 09:36.156
All right.
All right.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.458
We got your number.
It's a good one.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.992
We're waiting for you.
Let's go. Come on.

09:38.994 --> 09:40.210
I got my eye... ZACH:
I'm watching you.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.478
On you.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.447
(chanting): Let's get drunk!
Let's get drunk!

09:43.449 --> 09:44.614
Let's get drunk!

09:44.616 --> 09:45.966
Let's get drunk...

09:45.968 --> 09:48.218
I'm gonna go get
hydrated in my office.

09:49.754 --> 09:51.505
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

09:56.161 --> 09:58.445
ANDREW:
<i>So I realized the only thing</i>

09:58.447 --> 10:00.647
the float was missing
was the statement.

10:00.649 --> 10:02.532
So I rigged the fourth
leaf of the clover

10:02.534 --> 10:05.335
to break off when we get
to the viewing stand.

10:06.587 --> 10:08.121
I don't know what that means.

10:08.123 --> 10:09.406
How could that be more clear?

10:09.408 --> 10:12.125
With the disastrous economy,
12% unemployment...

10:12.127 --> 10:14.027
Ireland can no longer
rely on luck.

10:14.029 --> 10:16.379
So the four-leaf
shamrock becomes...

10:16.381 --> 10:18.131
just a clover.
You know what?

10:18.133 --> 10:20.350
Art should make you work.
I'm glad you don't get it.

10:20.352 --> 10:22.886
Wait. When did you
do all of this?

10:22.888 --> 10:24.554
You didn't leave the
bar until, like, 2:00.

10:24.556 --> 10:25.739
And you were really drunk.

10:25.741 --> 10:27.273
No, you were drunk.
I drank a lot.

10:27.275 --> 10:28.558
There's a difference.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.061
I'm a Keaneally. We're known
for our high tolerance.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.046
And our strangely short
second toes.

10:33.048 --> 10:35.448
Well, I have
the Roberts Hangover.

10:35.450 --> 10:37.701
I just pray that
today is a quiet day.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.419
SIMON:
No...!

10:39.421 --> 10:41.821
What have they done to me?

10:41.823 --> 10:43.523
I look like a lepre...

10:43.525 --> 10:46.810
chaun...!

10:46.812 --> 10:48.244
He really looks
like a leprechaun

10:48.246 --> 10:49.295
when he's mad.

10:49.297 --> 10:50.664
Please don't call
him a leprechaun.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.532
Someone give him back
his pot of gold.

10:52.534 --> 10:54.000
Or mention pots of gold.

10:54.002 --> 10:55.902
To be fair, it's really
no more upsetting

10:55.904 --> 10:58.221
than you as Cupid on Valentine's Day.
It was only upsetting

10:58.223 --> 10:59.889
because the arrow fell off
and skewered Carl.

10:59.891 --> 11:01.107
I'm gonna get an aspirin.

11:01.109 --> 11:04.010
Andrew, find Zach,
meet me in my office.

11:04.012 --> 11:06.012
He's already in there.

11:06.014 --> 11:08.415
Heads up, he had a rough night.

11:10.228 --> 11:12.268
Whoa! What the hell have
you she-devils done to him?

11:12.270 --> 11:13.386
He looks like a crack clown.

11:13.388 --> 11:15.071
How could you let him
drink so much?

11:15.073 --> 11:16.356
You're hard-drinking sailors.

11:16.358 --> 11:18.441
He's an ad guy
with a human liver.

11:18.443 --> 11:19.909
Zach, wake up, wake up.

11:19.911 --> 11:22.195
I don't want to go to school, Mom.
Oh...

11:22.197 --> 11:24.864
Don't worry, all that stuff
washes off.

11:24.866 --> 11:26.449
Really?

11:26.451 --> 11:28.785
(all exclaim)
That's not washing off.

11:28.787 --> 11:31.571
You broke my Zach!
Why can't I have nice things?

11:31.573 --> 11:33.173
What did they do?

11:33.175 --> 11:34.174
No, I wouldn't...

11:34.176 --> 11:36.342
No, don't.
Oh, my eye!

11:36.344 --> 11:38.211
My face! My <i>shayna punim!</i>

11:38.213 --> 11:41.214
Yeah, here's where it happened.

11:41.216 --> 11:43.883
WOMEN: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! GO!

11:43.885 --> 11:45.752
(all exclaim)

11:45.754 --> 11:47.303
(vomits)

11:52.092 --> 11:54.561
Oh, we popped his eye!

11:54.563 --> 11:56.062
Pop the other eye!

11:56.064 --> 11:57.881
Pop the other eye!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.649
There was chanting.
Yeah.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.201
So much chanting.
Endless chanting.

12:01.203 --> 12:02.435
We have a meeting today.

12:02.437 --> 12:04.954
We're supposed to pitch
to the Lady Razor ladies.

12:04.956 --> 12:06.489
I'll be fine.

12:06.491 --> 12:08.808
Hey, look, boss,
I can still be charming, huh?

12:08.810 --> 12:10.043
(all gasp) Oh, God!

12:10.045 --> 12:13.379
(all groaning)

12:16.133 --> 12:17.784
ANDREW:
I knew we were in trouble

12:17.786 --> 12:20.170
when the taller Lady Razor lady
started crying and said,

12:20.172 --> 12:21.755
"Can that one
stop looking at me?"

12:21.757 --> 12:23.673
We have to write
a whole new campaign.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.975
I can't believe you went out
partying with no regard

12:25.977 --> 12:27.844
for how much we rely
on your face.

12:27.846 --> 12:29.629
I'm sorry, boss.
I'd take my own life

12:29.631 --> 12:31.865
if only these Lady Razor razors
weren't so damned safe.

12:31.867 --> 12:35.068
My God, what more
can those harridans do?

12:36.136 --> 12:38.738
Where's my big boxing robot?

12:40.191 --> 12:42.025
Are you kidding me?!

12:42.027 --> 12:44.043
Come on! You've really
crossed a line this time!

12:44.045 --> 12:46.145
You come in, you think
you can just take over.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.247
You think you own everything!

12:47.249 --> 12:49.332
You pinch, you punch, you...
Hey!

12:49.334 --> 12:52.168
You stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks!
You bumped into the ceiling,

12:52.170 --> 12:54.003
so you get...
ALL: Nothing!

12:54.005 --> 12:55.455
Do not Willy Wonka me.

12:55.457 --> 12:57.590
You want to know why I've never
invited you to where I work?

12:57.592 --> 12:58.825
Because you're
an embarrassment.

12:58.827 --> 13:01.361
All of you! I mean, you
have no social skills!

13:01.363 --> 13:03.213
You can't even pick up
on simple social cues!

13:03.215 --> 13:04.664
And only one of you can blame it

13:04.666 --> 13:05.965
on an actual
Asperger's diagnosis!

13:05.967 --> 13:07.851
Hey!

13:07.853 --> 13:09.302
Message received.

13:09.304 --> 13:11.521
Come on, girls.
Let's hit the bar.

13:11.523 --> 13:13.306
You coming, Andy?

13:13.308 --> 13:16.109
No, I'm not coming
to the bar! I have to work!

13:16.111 --> 13:18.478
It's Dad all over again.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.114
Dad never screamed that high.
No.

13:21.116 --> 13:23.233
I still want to know
why he was yelling.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.351
(quiet, indistinct chatter)

13:26.704 --> 13:29.322
Blaine, you're in charge
of getting rid

13:29.324 --> 13:31.357
of everything
St. Patrick's Day-related.

13:31.359 --> 13:33.076
Leave no Blarney Stone
unturned.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.544
Lauren, take the date March 17

13:34.546 --> 13:35.829
off of every calendar
in this office.

13:35.831 --> 13:36.963
It no longer exists.

13:36.965 --> 13:38.681
But that's my birthday.
Pick another one.

13:38.683 --> 13:40.416
May I suggest something
in early December?

13:40.418 --> 13:41.968
You'll be a Sagittarius.
They're creative,

13:41.970 --> 13:43.269
they love to travel.

13:43.271 --> 13:45.004
From now on, there'll be
no more shenanigans.

13:45.006 --> 13:47.507
This is a place of business.
We will act as professionals.

13:47.509 --> 13:48.842
And if anyone needs me,

13:48.844 --> 13:51.427
I'll be in my office playing
with my big boxing robot.

13:54.248 --> 13:56.065
I bet they just captured a mom

13:56.067 --> 13:58.067
and made her give them
the recipe.

13:58.069 --> 14:00.103
Now, you see what I did
with "her" there?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.539
"Her. Her."
I came in big.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.274
That's called
having an intention.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.575
Okay, now you try it.

14:05.577 --> 14:07.861
I got it. Intention.

14:07.863 --> 14:11.063
Krispy Kreme.
They're cool when they're hot.

14:11.065 --> 14:12.081
That's perfect!

14:12.083 --> 14:13.700
Here, have a piece of candy.

14:13.702 --> 14:15.168
Yay! What for?

14:15.170 --> 14:17.253
Positive reinforcement. Every
time you say the line like that,

14:17.255 --> 14:19.255
I want you to give yourself
a piece of candy.

14:19.257 --> 14:21.841
Oh. It totally worked for me
when I was a child actor.

14:21.843 --> 14:24.043
I didn't have to have any
of my baby teeth pulled.

14:24.045 --> 14:26.312
They all rotted out. Wow. You
really were a good actress.

14:26.314 --> 14:29.399
I'm in a medical book.

14:29.401 --> 14:32.251
What the float happened
to my float, Blaine?!

14:32.253 --> 14:34.020
Where's my float?!
Simon said to get rid

14:34.022 --> 14:35.138
of anything
St. Patrick's Day.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.356
In the office, not my float!

14:36.358 --> 14:38.591
I see we made a slight boo-boo.
Come on, Andrew.

14:38.593 --> 14:39.859
You may not have a float,

14:39.861 --> 14:40.860
but we'll still give money

14:40.862 --> 14:41.978
to whatever
lame charity you picked.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.429
It's actually for kids, Simon.

14:43.431 --> 14:45.097
Whatever lame
kids charity you picked.

14:45.099 --> 14:48.551
Hey, mister, are we gonna get
our picture taken on the float?

14:48.553 --> 14:50.453
My God, it really is
a lame kids charity.

14:50.455 --> 14:52.071
No, I just twisted my ankle.

14:52.073 --> 14:54.157
Oh, good. Yeah, we actually
got a good charity this year.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.609
It's an after-school arts
program for inner-city kids.

14:56.611 --> 14:58.461
Oh. Who's the tall kid?

14:59.496 --> 15:00.947
I'm Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

15:00.949 --> 15:02.632
Wow! Yay!
And this tiny guy

15:02.634 --> 15:06.102
insisted we call the
charity "Simon's Kids""

15:06.104 --> 15:08.955
Oh. Does anyone else
feel the room spinning?

15:08.957 --> 15:11.841
We're not gonna be in the
parade this year, mister?

15:11.843 --> 15:13.092
No, Cameron,

15:13.094 --> 15:15.595
because the man
destroyed my float.

15:15.597 --> 15:16.896
ABDUL-JABBAR:
I was looking forward

15:16.898 --> 15:18.431
to seeing the clover's
undulating leaves.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.565
No-no!
Wait-wait-wait!

15:19.567 --> 15:20.967
No-no!
There's gonna be a float.

15:20.969 --> 15:22.268
It's just not finished yet.

15:22.270 --> 15:23.803
Do you know where the float is?

15:23.805 --> 15:25.154
It's in the leprechaun's
workshop.

15:25.156 --> 15:26.639
And they're working on it

15:26.641 --> 15:28.474
night and day because
it's not a union workshop.

15:28.476 --> 15:29.492
And you know what?

15:29.494 --> 15:31.444
It's gonna be
a most wonderful float

15:31.446 --> 15:32.912
you've ever seen there,
Tiny Tim.

15:32.914 --> 15:34.313
It's gonna sham-rock your world.

15:34.315 --> 15:36.482
Okay, team, to the float cave.

15:36.484 --> 15:37.984
Ah!

15:37.986 --> 15:40.169
Do we even have a float cave?

15:40.171 --> 15:42.839
- I'm not sure. Let's find out.
- Okay.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:51.063 --> 15:54.316
This is feeling good.
How long we been at it?

15:54.318 --> 15:55.734
- A little over two hours.
- Oh.

15:55.736 --> 15:57.185
Okay, let's just take a minute

15:57.187 --> 15:59.904
- to objectively evaluate
what we've done. - Okay.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.241
SIMON:
And the parade starts in...

16:03.243 --> 16:04.192
A little over ten hours.

16:04.194 --> 16:05.493
- So we're...
- Screwed.

16:05.495 --> 16:07.979
And even if we do finish...
which is highly unlikely...

16:07.981 --> 16:10.081
it's just gonna be a
flatbed of green Post-its.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.451
Or is it a magical green snake
that was driven out of Ireland?

16:13.453 --> 16:15.503
No, we're screwed. And we're
almost out of Post-its.

16:15.505 --> 16:16.871
Oh, how'd it go?!

16:16.873 --> 16:18.173
- Got fired.
- What?

16:18.175 --> 16:20.258
I mean, didn't you use
my candy technique?

16:20.260 --> 16:24.079
Oh, she used it
and used it and used it.

16:30.319 --> 16:31.986
What's my line again?

16:34.056 --> 16:35.523
Let's do this!

16:35.525 --> 16:37.058
(candy crunching)

16:37.060 --> 16:39.060
Ooh.

16:39.062 --> 16:40.995
Krispy Kreme.
They're cool when they're hot

16:40.997 --> 16:42.364
and they're hot
when they're cool

16:42.366 --> 16:43.832
and they're cool
when they're hot!

16:44.700 --> 16:47.369
Feels good on my gums.

16:47.371 --> 16:49.421
This is my fault.

16:49.423 --> 16:51.122
My secret candy technique
backfired.

16:51.124 --> 16:53.291
(quietly): Oh, at least someone's
taking responsibility.

16:53.293 --> 16:54.959
Excuse me. What was
that snide mumble?

16:54.961 --> 16:56.711
I do not snide-mumble.
Really?

16:56.713 --> 16:58.346
Because if we're
looking to lay blame,

16:58.348 --> 16:59.514
I gave you a meaningful look

16:59.516 --> 17:00.849
suggesting you control
your sisters.

17:00.851 --> 17:02.967
Uh, you were the one
who invited my sisters to stay.

17:02.969 --> 17:04.301
You didn't need
to destroy my float.

17:04.304 --> 17:06.087
I didn't mean to destroy your float.
Well, you did.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.806
It's kind of gone.
I don't get it.

17:07.808 --> 17:09.357
There's plenty
of boozy holidays.

17:09.358 --> 17:10.474
On New Year's, you're the

17:10.477 --> 17:12.527
first one into
a diaper and top hat.

17:12.529 --> 17:14.145
It's a tradition!
Yeah, we could lose that.

17:14.146 --> 17:16.097
I just don't get
why you're so opposed

17:16.098 --> 17:17.982
to this particular holiday.

17:17.983 --> 17:20.318
I'll tell you why.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.936
I used to own this town
on St. Patrick's Day.

17:22.939 --> 17:24.539
I miss that. Not the drinking.

17:24.540 --> 17:26.607
I miss the camaraderie,
the letting go.

17:26.608 --> 17:28.159
That was the night you took it

17:28.161 --> 17:30.328
to the next level.
You tell embarrassing stories,

17:30.330 --> 17:32.914
the joy of a group of
total strangers coming together

17:32.916 --> 17:34.883
to flip over an O'Doul's truck.
That's pretty cool.

17:34.885 --> 17:36.851
That's you every day.

17:36.853 --> 17:39.704
Yeah, but that was the night
all of Chicago did it with me.

17:39.706 --> 17:42.056
Simon, we always want
to hang out with you.

17:42.058 --> 17:43.291
It's my fault.
I was trying

17:43.293 --> 17:44.642
to protect you from all of it.

17:44.644 --> 17:46.928
I'm sorry you felt left out.
Aw, baby.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.813
How's it going, Zacky?

17:48.815 --> 17:50.315
WOMEN: Zacky...! Oh, my God.

17:50.317 --> 17:51.933
How did you find me?

17:51.935 --> 17:53.435
Oh, after you passed out
last night,

17:53.437 --> 17:55.403
we had a a microchip
implanted in your neck.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.472
What? Seriously?

17:57.474 --> 17:59.240
No, I texted them, jagbag.

17:59.242 --> 18:02.193
Nice use of jagbag.
We're here to help.

18:02.195 --> 18:04.662
Come on. Even after
I was such a jerk?

18:04.664 --> 18:07.482
Oh, Andy, you can get
as fancy as you want,

18:07.484 --> 18:08.833
but as long as you have

18:08.835 --> 18:10.869
that short second toe,
you're one of us.

18:10.871 --> 18:12.921
Please tell me you can help us.

18:12.923 --> 18:14.772
What? Of course they can.

18:14.774 --> 18:16.708
They're grade-school teachers.

18:16.710 --> 18:19.961
Masters of the hastily
thrown together art project.

18:19.963 --> 18:22.630
It's all about the three G's:
glue, glitter and gin.

18:22.632 --> 18:25.767
Yeah, all right, ladies,
let's hit the streets.

18:25.769 --> 18:26.935
Anything green, we want it.

18:26.937 --> 18:28.636
Ooh, someone should snag
that neon rainbow sign

18:28.638 --> 18:30.104
from the gay bar on the corner.

18:30.106 --> 18:32.023
I'd do it, but I don't
want another strike.

18:32.025 --> 18:33.107
- On it.
- Great.

18:33.109 --> 18:34.225
- I got the gin.
- ANDRE: By "ladies""

18:34.227 --> 18:35.443
you meant me, too, right?

18:35.445 --> 18:37.896
There's a homeless
Packers fan over on Third.

18:39.281 --> 18:41.282
I like these girls.

18:42.851 --> 18:45.453
♪

19:00.669 --> 19:05.139
♪ Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling ♪

19:05.141 --> 19:09.010

19:17.821 --> 19:20.822
- Here's a secret not even Andy knows.
- Uh-oh.

19:20.824 --> 19:23.992
- The doctor was caught in a snowstorm...
- Oh, yeah.

19:23.994 --> 19:25.193
So we circumcised him.

19:25.195 --> 19:27.445
(all laugh) We did!

19:27.447 --> 19:29.730
There's no such thing as
an emergency circumcision.

19:29.732 --> 19:31.449
You could have
waited for the thaw.

19:31.451 --> 19:32.667
(all laugh)

19:32.669 --> 19:35.403
I should be mad, but you
guys did a fantastic job.

19:35.405 --> 19:37.455
Simon, you tell us a secret.

19:37.457 --> 19:38.590
Okay.

19:38.592 --> 19:40.291
I once French-kissed
Wolf Blitzer.

19:40.293 --> 19:41.843
Oh! On a dare?

19:41.845 --> 19:42.877
On a yacht.

19:42.879 --> 19:44.913
Ted Turner makes you dance
for your dinner.

19:44.915 --> 19:46.514
(all laugh)

19:46.516 --> 19:48.883
Okay, I have a secret.

19:49.935 --> 19:51.352
Lauren...

19:51.354 --> 19:54.389
I think I might have been
a little jealous of you.

19:54.391 --> 19:56.858
I didn't mean to
give you bad advice.

19:56.860 --> 19:59.694
I don't know why I'm such a know-it-all.
You're not a know-it-all.

19:59.696 --> 20:02.146
I think I would know
if I'm a know-it-all.

20:02.148 --> 20:03.781
I swear I meant well.

20:03.783 --> 20:04.782
I know that.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.234
And jealous of me?

20:06.236 --> 20:08.269
Sydney, you're my role model.

20:08.271 --> 20:11.289
You're smart and tough,
but still nice to people.

20:11.291 --> 20:13.591
If I could suck
your life force dry, I would.

20:13.593 --> 20:17.278
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

20:17.280 --> 20:21.916
I-I'd like to phrase my secret
in the form of a question:

20:21.918 --> 20:24.435
Did Elaine and I
do it last night?

20:24.437 --> 20:26.588
Like most of the guys
I hook up with,

20:26.590 --> 20:27.622
you'll never know.

20:27.624 --> 20:29.290
(all exclaim and laugh)

20:29.292 --> 20:31.392
SIMON: Look at this.
Inappropriate hookups,

20:31.394 --> 20:34.712
sharing secrets: best
St. Patrick's Day I've ever had.

20:34.714 --> 20:36.598
ALL:
Aw...

Ready cam record.

20:46.943 --> 20:50.244

20:50.246 --> 20:52.580
Oh, I wasn't crazy?

20:55.117 --> 20:57.201
I can't believe I'm doing this.
