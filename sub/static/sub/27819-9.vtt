WEBVTT

00:03.667 --> 00:05.000
Terrorists, a nuke,

00:05.083 --> 00:07.291
and a corrupt military unit
coming after us.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.542
This is gonna be fun.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.458
Pavel, you need me in there.

00:10.542 --> 00:13.667
Twenty see you as a traitor.
They will kill you on sight.

00:13.917 --> 00:15.709
Don't make me do this.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.917
I don't even know
what I'm fighting for anymore.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.041
You know what this is?

00:19.125 --> 00:21.583
It's a remote transmitter.
What is it for?

00:21.667 --> 00:24.166
Why have a bomb
if it won't go off?

00:24.250 --> 00:25.250
It's counting down.

00:25.333 --> 00:26.542
It's probably a good time
to tell ya that

00:26.792 --> 00:28.917
if we get out of this alive,
I'm kinda done with this life.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.750
If we shoot the bomb,
it will not detonate.

00:30.834 --> 00:32.458
All right, fuck it,
let's shoot the bomb.

00:34.959 --> 00:36.250
I'm here to help you.

00:36.792 --> 00:38.291
You have chosen a side.

00:38.375 --> 00:39.875
Whatever you're planning to do...

00:39.959 --> 00:41.959
I'm willing to do
what needs to be done.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.417
They think that Pavel
is trying to force

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
the West and Russia into a war
that neither side can avoid.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.083
Russia's asking for our help?

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.000 --> 01:06.625
I used to have this mate...

01:06.709 --> 01:11.291
an American, Samuel Wyatt.

01:13.625 --> 01:17.834
He was fond of saying people
are either grease or gravel.

01:19.291 --> 01:22.166
Guys that make your life easier
or they slow it down.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.709
So I'm wondering which one
are you?

01:36.583 --> 01:38.709
How much did you pay for it?

01:40.917 --> 01:42.417
Where's Pavel Kuragin?

01:45.542 --> 01:48.333
I know you bought
a suitcase nuke off him,

01:48.417 --> 01:50.041
and I know where
you've stashed it.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.041
You don't know anything.

01:55.917 --> 01:57.208
Okay.

02:01.291 --> 02:04.125
Tekura Compound.

02:05.709 --> 02:09.333
And right about now my team
are on their way there.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.875
Isn't that where
your family are?

02:13.959 --> 02:15.792
Your wife, your kid...

02:15.875 --> 02:18.250
How old's your kid?
Nine, ten?

02:19.709 --> 02:22.000
Tell me about Pavel,

02:22.083 --> 02:23.667
and I'll make sure
they're protected.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.250
Bravo Two, into position.

02:39.250 --> 02:41.792
You know how it is
in those situations,

02:41.875 --> 02:45.959
confusion, noise;
shoot first, ID later.

02:46.041 --> 02:49.000
Ready on three.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.583
- I know nothing.
- Want me to jog your memory?

02:51.667 --> 02:55.667
Pavel Kuragin, Russian agent,
disavowed by his own country.

02:55.750 --> 02:56.583
Two...

02:56.667 --> 02:57.875
He's gone rogue,
he's on the run.

02:57.959 --> 02:59.291
- Not ringing any bells?
- One...

02:59.375 --> 03:00.542
Haven't seen him?

03:00.625 --> 03:01.542
Breaching.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.875
Go, go, go, go, go!

03:12.500 --> 03:14.125
On me.

03:16.709 --> 03:19.792
- Three.
- We can't.

03:19.875 --> 03:20.792
Code nine!

03:22.834 --> 03:24.208
That's your family in there,
mate.

03:24.291 --> 03:26.583
Enemy Foxtrot in the house,
proceed.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.625
Tango's down.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.375
Chetri!

03:44.667 --> 03:46.375
Doesn't sound good.

03:46.458 --> 03:50.125
First floor clear.
Moving up.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.417
Ten million.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.458
We paid ten million
for the device.

03:54.542 --> 03:55.709
Very good.
Now we've started.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.125
Now tell me about Kuragin.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.125
Bravos, you take point.
Ready to move up?

03:59.208 --> 04:00.125
Moving.

04:05.667 --> 04:06.834
Moving in.

04:06.917 --> 04:10.166
Come on, Fahad,
that's your family in there.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.250
You must be scared.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.834
I'd hate for there to be
a mistake.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.916
We didn't deal with Kuragin.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.750
We dealt with a woman.

04:28.125 --> 04:31.417
Natasha Petrenko,
we had surveillance on her.

04:32.542 --> 04:34.750
Get down!

04:34.834 --> 04:35.709
Get down.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.291
Make it stop.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.291
- Room clear.
- No.

04:48.375 --> 04:52.917
Boss, package located.
We have the second nuke.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.834
Did we get Pavel?

04:57.917 --> 04:59.917
No, but we got a lead.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Well, it better be good.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.291
I've been chasing shadows
for too long.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.542
We need Pavel
and we need him now.

How was your run?

07:00.875 --> 07:02.333
Yeah, good.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.750
What time's your flight?

07:03.834 --> 07:05.959
Flight is 1:30.

07:08.041 --> 07:09.417
Two weeks, that's it.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.208
Shenzen, Shanghai, then I'm home

07:11.291 --> 07:12.959
with a nice fat paycheck

07:13.041 --> 07:16.208
courtesy of
Mr. Caleb Montgomery.

07:16.291 --> 07:17.917
And bringing back
an expensive gift

07:18.000 --> 07:19.125
for your patient wife.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.125
You know, most people
would say the gift of love

07:21.208 --> 07:22.458
is more than enough.

07:22.542 --> 07:24.834
They're wrong.

07:24.917 --> 07:26.625
Okay, I love you.

07:26.709 --> 07:28.500
- Love you, too.
- Bye.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.125
- You know, maybe today...
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.208 --> 07:35.458
You could be, say...

07:35.542 --> 07:38.166
I don't know, 15 minutes late.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.959
- 15 minutes?
- Yeah.

07:40.041 --> 07:42.000
Aren't you the optimistic one?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.417
Ten?

07:43.500 --> 07:45.792
I'll take five.
Mm.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.917
Aw, come on, don't leave me.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.166
Look, I know it hasn't been
easy getting work, and...

07:53.250 --> 07:55.667
Don't worry about me.
I'm good.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.417
It's a nice, boring security job

07:58.500 --> 08:00.000
for a tech company.

08:00.083 --> 08:02.166
Not all the military stuff

08:02.250 --> 08:03.709
and everything that
came along with it.

08:03.792 --> 08:06.125
It's in the past, it's good.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.041
Maybe I realized there's
more important things

08:08.125 --> 08:09.750
than the saving the world.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.667
- "Saving the world"?
- Yeah.

08:11.750 --> 08:15.291
Well, you need help.

08:15.375 --> 08:16.875
Bye.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.458
Miss you.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.291
Love you.

08:44.207 --> 08:46.834
Good morning, asshole.

08:57.709 --> 09:00.041
This is the person who
brokered the sale of the nuke

09:00.125 --> 09:01.291
to the Tehrik-i-Taliban;

09:01.375 --> 09:05.458
Natasha Petrenko, SVR Russian
Intelligence Officer.

09:05.542 --> 09:08.041
Died three years ago
in a car crash, supposedly.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.041
Looks pretty good for a corpse.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.750
According to Alpha files,
she was taken off the grid,

09:12.834 --> 09:15.417
worked as a deep cover
operative, currently disavowed.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.959
Disavowed because...

09:18.041 --> 09:20.250
- It's redacted.
- Wonderful.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.417
How helpful.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.500
Maybe after the Kingfisher
project was shuttered,

09:23.583 --> 09:25.625
Moscow got nervous
and started closing down

09:25.709 --> 09:27.041
other similar ops.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.083
Seems like your lot has
a problem with

09:29.166 --> 09:30.792
pissed off agents going rogue.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.917
Well, they've made it
our problem now.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.583
Kuragin's got ten million
in the bank,

09:34.667 --> 09:36.834
hooking up with
another renegade operative.

09:36.917 --> 09:38.542
Pavel's ramping up to something.

09:38.625 --> 09:42.250
Something big if he wants
to start a war.

09:42.333 --> 09:47.250
Unfortunately Moscow and London
have each decided

09:47.333 --> 09:49.583
that 20 might not be up to this.

09:49.667 --> 09:50.750
What?

09:50.834 --> 09:52.667
They are aware we just recovered

09:52.750 --> 09:54.291
the other suitcase nuke?

09:54.375 --> 09:56.709
Yes, I know.
Well done, us.

09:56.792 --> 10:01.750
But according to both sides,
Pavel is always one step ahead.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.625
Which means we have
one last chance before

10:07.709 --> 10:10.375
they pull the plug on
the joint op.

10:11.542 --> 10:13.750
How long have we got to wrap up?

10:13.834 --> 10:16.125
- Ten days.
- Bloody brilliant.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.750
Facial recognition has
picked up Petrenko at

10:18.834 --> 10:21.208
Saidu Sharif airport
eight hours ago.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.625
We could find out where
she was going,

10:22.709 --> 10:24.125
track her out the other side.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.125
Very good.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.083
As soon as we get
a destination, we move.

10:29.083 --> 10:32.917
Captain Zarkova, a word.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.959
Great.

10:35.041 --> 10:38.041
Time to complain to the Russian
about the Russians.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.875
Redacted files, really?

10:42.959 --> 10:45.125
We need better intelligence
from our partners in Moscow.

10:45.208 --> 10:47.625
We're actually
discussing work, okay.

10:47.709 --> 10:49.250
Well, what did you think
we were doing?

10:49.333 --> 10:51.667
Just that thing we said
we wouldn't do again

10:51.750 --> 10:53.542
four or five times.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.000
You know they're not going
to share

10:57.083 --> 10:58.500
that level of information
with the West.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.834
It's their rogue agent that
we're hunting.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.000
And it's your people
who took all the credit

11:03.083 --> 11:04.208
for securing the suitcase nuke.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.625
Because we were the ones
to bring it in.

11:05.709 --> 11:08.417
Yeah, not like I was there,
too, or anything...

11:08.500 --> 11:11.917
risking my life.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.417
And I suppose it was
always gonna be

11:13.500 --> 11:17.000
a conflict of interest
sooner or later...

11:17.083 --> 11:19.375
East versus West.

11:19.458 --> 11:24.208
Yeah, I guess it was always
gonna get a little complicated.

11:41.792 --> 11:44.625
Zero Alpha,
got a locale on Petrenko.

11:44.709 --> 11:46.834
She's in Hong Kong.

11:47.959 --> 11:50.208
Prepare to move out.

11:50.291 --> 11:53.083
I swear she does that
on purpose.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.792
Good work, kid.

11:58.208 --> 12:00.375
I'm 27, but thank you.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.583
It's a term of endearment.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.417
We good?

12:04.500 --> 12:07.750
You know, she nearly got
tagged in the raid.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.542
This is fucked up.

12:09.625 --> 12:10.750
I'm training her as fast
as I can, mate.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.750
I know, but we need
the boots on the ground.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.166
It was a lot easier
with Wyatt on my shoulder.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.625
Yeah, it was,
but he made his choice.

13:04.208 --> 13:05.625
Hmm.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.875
Good morning, sir.
Yes, it is.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.667
Here's what I can offer
your military:

13:36.750 --> 13:40.083
Propriety satellite control
and monitoring systems.

13:40.166 --> 13:43.083
It's expensive,
but there are times in life

13:43.166 --> 13:45.667
when you wanna cut costs,
gentlemen.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.417
This is not one of those times.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.500
Soda, diet.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.667
You wanna spar with me, bro?

14:03.750 --> 14:05.709
Oh, I'm good, sir.

14:07.625 --> 14:10.750
What, afraid I'll kick your ass?

14:14.166 --> 14:17.041
Yeah, something like that.

14:17.125 --> 14:18.792
Do you need security
this evening, sir?

14:18.875 --> 14:21.250
Calendar says you have
a meeting.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.375
Calendar's wrong.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.500
Have the driver bring
the car around front.

14:29.959 --> 14:32.083
You think everyone's an asshole.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.709
Yeah, okay, that's true,
but this guy's...

14:34.792 --> 14:36.125
he's in a class of his own.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.000
And I swear
he's up to something.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.750
"Up to something"?

14:39.834 --> 14:42.417
You are just there to do
security, right?

14:42.500 --> 14:44.834
Yeah, honey, of course.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.542
You sound a lot like
the old Samuel Wyatt right now.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.667
No, no, no, no, no,

14:48.750 --> 14:50.667
just observing and reporting,
that's all.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.709
Don't worry about me.

14:54.667 --> 14:55.667
Hey, listen, I got to go.

14:55.750 --> 14:58.333
I got to go do some timesheets
and shit.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.583
All right, talk to you later.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.375
Yeah.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.917
Hey, you have a good day
at work, okay?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.458
I love you.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.375
Love you, too.

15:49.458 --> 15:53.041
Surveillance cameras got
a hit on Natasha Petrenko.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.417
Looks like we're on for

15:54.500 --> 15:56.959
the Tshin Shan nightclub
in Kowloon.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.041
I can hook into the CCTV system,

15:59.125 --> 16:00.208
get eyes inside.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.291
The rest of you head in,
find Petrenko,

16:02.375 --> 16:04.333
find out why she's there,
and who she's meeting.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.500
Are we thinking Pavel?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.792
I can't see it,
not in a public place.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.250
Well, he won't be far away.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.458
It will be something.

16:12.542 --> 16:13.834
She sells the nuke,
gets ten million,

16:13.917 --> 16:15.417
heads straight for this place,
so...

16:15.500 --> 16:19.000
So be careful,
and don't spook the horses.

16:38.083 --> 16:41.709
Bravos, there's a VIP area
which is reserved

16:41.792 --> 16:44.375
for one client.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.417
I'm having issues with
the CCTV feed.

16:51.542 --> 16:54.166
Seems to be some interference
coming from inside.

16:54.250 --> 16:56.875
There's a wine-tasting lounge
downstairs,

16:56.959 --> 16:59.709
surveillance junction box
in the far corner.

16:59.792 --> 17:01.041
I'm on it.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.458
Eyes on the familiar,
Artem Orlov,

17:25.541 --> 17:27.791
former Black Sea marine.

17:31.125 --> 17:34.166
VIP area located.

17:37.709 --> 17:42.083
Orlov, 482nd Russian Marine
Battalion,

17:42.166 --> 17:45.250
listed missing-in-action, 2015.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.500
Another dead Russian
walking around.

17:48.583 --> 17:49.583
Right, well, stay sharp.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.583
Could be other hostiles
in the area.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.000
Eyes on Echo One...

18:06.083 --> 18:08.041
heading towards VIP area.

18:08.125 --> 18:10.417
Keep your distance.
You don't wanna blow this.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.667
Bravo One is attending to
the CCTV.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.625
Let's get eyes on them first.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.166
Copy that.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.583
Come on, let's just get
our asses in there.

18:27.667 --> 18:31.000
The Colonel has given us
an order, wait and watch.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.959
Yeah, and how 'bout
you screwing him?

18:33.041 --> 18:34.959
Is that orders as well?

18:35.041 --> 18:37.458
You know, Russia covering
her bases.

18:37.542 --> 18:41.583
You know, Russia
covering all her bases.

18:41.667 --> 18:42.875
You have eyes, yes?

18:42.959 --> 18:45.375
You have seen his cheekbones,
that tight little butt,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.417
makes you want to s...

18:46.500 --> 18:47.625
Yeah, yeah... oh.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.458
Strong arms, really strong arms.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.875
Okay, mate, I'm sorry I asked.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.125
Not everything is work.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.375
Unknown Tango, moving to engage.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.417
All right,
turn around nice and slow.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.667
Wyatt?
Mac?

19:25.750 --> 19:28.542
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:28.625 --> 19:30.041
I'm working.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.291
You look good, man.
You look like you lost weight.

19:32.375 --> 19:36.333
Thanks.
I like the...

19:36.417 --> 19:38.834
Clean up.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.542
So, what are you doing here?

19:41.625 --> 19:43.834
I'm trying to hack into
the CCTV system.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.917
You're tracking Petrenko
as well?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.709
Petrenko?
No, no, no.

19:47.792 --> 19:50.542
I'm on this asshole,
Caleb Montgomery.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.542
I'm working for him.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.542
Who's Montgomery?

19:53.625 --> 19:54.959
You know, he's a tech guy.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.709
You know, security,
satellite systems,

19:56.792 --> 19:59.542
that kind of thing.

19:59.625 --> 20:00.792
Tracked a few payments to him

20:00.875 --> 20:03.083
from a Kingfisher shell company.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.125
So I swung a job on
a security team.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.375
Are you working for the CIA now?

20:08.458 --> 20:12.000
No.
No, no, I'm self-employed.

20:12.083 --> 20:15.667
It's kind of a hobby
more than anything.

20:15.750 --> 20:20.250
Pavel shot me, Mac.
It still hurts when I piss.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.083
I have to get him.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.959
Zero, target could be
a Caleb Montgomery.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.250
I've identified the sources of

20:27.333 --> 20:29.333
the surveillance interference
and I'm fixing it.

20:29.417 --> 20:31.875
Mind out, mate, duty calls.

20:31.959 --> 20:34.917
I'm sorry, did you just refer
to me as interference?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.375
You're fucking up our feed,
mate.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.875
So what's your op,
this Petrenko guy?

20:38.959 --> 20:43.208
Petrenko woman,
possible associate of Pavel.

20:43.291 --> 20:45.542
Yours?
Yeah.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.125
So wait, your target could be
meeting up with my target.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.166
Could be.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.417
Well, ain't that a small world.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.917
Too bloody small.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.709
We're fighting the same war,
Mac.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.291
They say you should never mix
business and pleasure,

21:01.375 --> 21:04.375
but that's never been
a problem of mine.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.291
Ah, here.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.291
What happened here?

21:10.375 --> 21:12.125
What does it matter?

21:12.208 --> 21:14.917
- It's called small talk.
- I don't do small talk.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.875
Humor me.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.834
I fell out of a tree as a child.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.625
Well, that doesn't look like
the kind of scar you'd get

21:21.709 --> 21:24.083
falling from a tree,
now does it?

21:24.166 --> 21:25.250
Cheers.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.917
Eyes on Echo.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.125
Looks like some kind of deal
going down.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.041
Observing only.
Let it play out.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.291
Bravo One, moving out.

21:40.375 --> 21:41.291
Where do you think you're going?

21:41.375 --> 21:42.959
- Coming with you.
- No, you're not.

21:43.041 --> 21:44.500
I'm sensing some tension, Mac.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.083
Is this because I left without
saying good-bye?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.333
No, it's because I'm working.

21:47.417 --> 21:49.041
So stay back
and let me do my job.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.500
We don't fit in...

21:51.583 --> 21:55.750
always checking the room,
always a little on edge.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.667
I can spot military a mile away.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.667
No offense, mate, but there's
two of us and one of you.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.709
Hmm.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.041
You should have brought
more men.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.375
Huh?

22:06.667 --> 22:08.834
Boryenka here doesn't
understand English,

22:08.917 --> 22:11.625
so I'm quite comfortable in
telling you he has

22:11.709 --> 22:14.542
no redeeming social
or professional qualities

22:14.625 --> 22:19.625
beyond being a... fucking thug.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.166
Big Mac and his big mouth.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.291
I'll get the big fella, then.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.125
Do you have what I asked for?

22:47.208 --> 22:48.458
Do you have the money?

22:48.542 --> 22:50.709
Five million,
ready for transfer.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.542
Well, five feels a little low.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.500
I mean, what we're doing here
isn't exactly legal.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.500
Make it eight.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.500
What makes you think
I have that money?

22:58.583 --> 23:01.083
Hell, you rented out
the whole VIP section,

23:01.166 --> 23:04.000
so let's call it a hunch.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.500
Bet you wish you'd indulged me

23:05.583 --> 23:07.834
in some fucking small talk now,
huh?

23:07.917 --> 23:10.500
You were advanced one million
on an understanding...

23:10.583 --> 23:13.125
You just got to shake out
the other seven.

23:13.208 --> 23:14.917
But if you're not interested,
I can go.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.709
No, I'm interested.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.667
You wanna give me a hand?

23:47.542 --> 23:50.375
Just like old times.

23:50.458 --> 23:52.041
Prick.

23:53.959 --> 23:55.834
Oh, you son of a bitch.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.125
It's a deal, then.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.417
You know, and you're right.

24:07.500 --> 24:11.542
This scar was not from a tree.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.834
Deal's gone wrong, move in,
grab the principles.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.250
Go, go, go.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.792
I am two inches from
your femoral artery...

24:25.875 --> 24:27.125
Pl... please.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.125
Please.

24:29.208 --> 24:32.000
Transfer the software we need.

24:32.083 --> 24:35.000
Okay.

24:35.083 --> 24:37.500
Okay, okay... look, look, look.
Okay.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.166
It's doing it.
It's doing it.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.959
Look, look, look.
It's just... pl... ow, please!

24:49.667 --> 24:52.125
Please!

25:08.709 --> 25:09.583
Got Echo.

25:09.667 --> 25:11.000
Getting target.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.750
Wha...?
Fucking stabbed me.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.041
You'll live.
Up.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.250
Move.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.375
Bravo Two, sit-rep.

25:23.458 --> 25:25.625
We have the asset,
moving to exfil.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.041
Wyatt?
Hey, short stuff.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.458
Dickhead.

25:31.542 --> 25:33.959
- Take 'em out the back.
- Copy.

25:34.959 --> 25:36.000
Hey, boss, how you doing?

25:36.083 --> 25:37.125
What the hell are you
doing here?

25:37.208 --> 25:39.083
Come on, move.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.208
Everybody get down!

26:04.291 --> 26:06.709
Shit!

26:18.166 --> 26:21.166
Oh, shit.
Get down!

26:41.500 --> 26:43.959
Bravo, sit-rep.

26:44.041 --> 26:46.250
Pavel set off an IED.

26:46.333 --> 26:47.709
I've lost eyes on Echo One.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.834
Emergency services,
police inbound.

26:51.834 --> 26:54.333
We have the target.
Alpha and Echo are gone.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.667
Move the target out to
the RV point.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.250
Boss, we've got
injured civilians.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.083
We cannot be caught here.

27:00.166 --> 27:02.000
Move out.
We're on our way.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.458
Let's go.
Novin, let's go.

27:09.709 --> 27:11.458
I was stabbed in
the fucking leg, man.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.375
You said you would take me
to the hospital.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.583
Yeah, we will,
just as soon as you answer

27:16.667 --> 27:18.458
a few more questions.

27:18.542 --> 27:21.917
You know what?
You're done.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.458
I'm gonna make sure
you never work again.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.417
What'd you sell the Russians?

27:29.500 --> 27:32.000
They're rogue agents, you know?

27:33.500 --> 27:34.709
What, you think I'm scared
of you

27:34.792 --> 27:37.208
and Sergeant Burnout here?

27:37.291 --> 27:41.917
This guy comes to me,
begging for a job.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Actually felt sorry for him.

27:44.083 --> 27:47.208
Ex-military, couldn't hack it
in the real world.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.667
Hey.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.500
You don't get to talk
about him like that.

27:51.583 --> 27:54.458
Not now, not ever.

27:56.083 --> 28:00.125
Besides, it's not actually us
you have to worry about.

28:00.208 --> 28:01.834
It's everybody else, asshole.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.917
Hong Kong authorities,

28:04.000 --> 28:06.625
British and American
Intelligence agencies,

28:06.709 --> 28:08.458
Securities and Exchange
Commission,

28:08.542 --> 28:09.750
not to mention the Russians.

28:09.834 --> 28:11.000
What is it your lot want to do?

28:11.083 --> 28:12.333
Just to take him to the enhanced

28:12.417 --> 28:14.000
interrogation center in Siberia.

28:14.083 --> 28:18.667
Yeah, I definitely wouldn't
recommend that one.

28:18.750 --> 28:23.709
You see, we're the easy way,
Mr. Montgomery.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.291
Where are they going?

28:29.375 --> 28:30.667
All I know is it's some

28:30.750 --> 28:33.250
off-books Russian
satellite station.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.333
Artem, you're late.

28:45.417 --> 28:48.250
No Russian.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.750
You were supposed to
protect her exfil.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.083
I was.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.834
I was dealing with
British military.

28:55.917 --> 28:59.792
A lifetime of wet work,
assassination,

28:59.875 --> 29:02.917
Odessa, Kiev,
the Black Sea massacre...

29:03.000 --> 29:04.750
I knew you would find
your way out,

29:04.834 --> 29:07.917
because you are
very good at your job.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.750
We were all good at our jobs,
before a regime that

29:10.834 --> 29:12.583
forced us to give up everything,

29:12.667 --> 29:15.250
betrayed us anyway,
cast us aside.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.917
First you abandon me

29:17.000 --> 29:19.750
and now you're giving me
a fucking speech?

29:19.834 --> 29:21.792
Artem, you ready?

29:24.250 --> 29:26.542
Then we better get moving.

29:29.000 --> 29:34.208
Just remember, we're working
with you, not for you.

29:54.250 --> 29:57.458
Uh-uh.
Put it down.

29:57.542 --> 30:00.125
On your knees!
Move.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.750
I said move.
Move, move!

30:04.166 --> 30:07.583
Move!
Get your fucking hands up.

30:07.667 --> 30:10.000
Satellite control systems.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.583
Eyes down.

30:14.667 --> 30:18.375
Okay, let's go.
Look at the fucking floor.

30:18.458 --> 30:21.125
Uploading the worm
from Mr. Montgomery.

30:21.208 --> 30:23.667
Now we find out if it works

30:23.750 --> 30:26.125
or if we've all just wasted
our time.

30:26.208 --> 30:30.000
Artem, give her room.

30:32.417 --> 30:33.583
They wanted malware to crack

30:33.667 --> 30:35.709
the control systems
I had installed.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.375
They're looking to gain access
to a ghost satellite,

30:38.458 --> 30:39.834
Designation Sobaka.

30:39.917 --> 30:42.208
What's so important about
this satellite?

30:42.291 --> 30:44.041
Ask your own people.

30:44.125 --> 30:46.875
All I know is,
these rogue agents of yours,

30:46.959 --> 30:49.959
they plan to bring it
crashing down to earth.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.333
We need the frequency of
the satellite signal.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.041
You can't link up with it here.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.458
That's why they need access
to the facility.

30:57.542 --> 30:58.500
Plug right into the hardware...

30:58.583 --> 30:59.583
We don't need to plug in.

30:59.667 --> 31:00.875
Listen, I'm sure you're just
fucking peachy

31:00.959 --> 31:02.125
and everyone just loves you,
but this shit is my...

31:02.208 --> 31:03.709
We just need to interrupt
their signal.

31:03.792 --> 31:07.000
I mean, that could work.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.875
Yeah.

31:10.792 --> 31:13.959
- We're hooked in.
- How long?

31:14.041 --> 31:16.625
30 minutes.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.792
Please, let the others go.

31:18.875 --> 31:20.083
What do you think we're planning

31:20.166 --> 31:21.250
to do with you all?

31:21.333 --> 31:24.500
We're not animals.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.792
We're patriots.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.125
Well?

31:35.208 --> 31:37.542
I spoke to General Pokrovsky
about the satellite...

31:37.625 --> 31:39.917
And?
Did he say what it was?

31:40.000 --> 31:42.792
Or why Kuragin's so interested
in it?

31:42.875 --> 31:45.125
My superiors either don't know

31:45.208 --> 31:49.333
or they don't wish to share
that information with the West.

31:53.834 --> 31:55.458
Very well.

31:58.834 --> 32:02.166
It's just a boring investment
conference, that's it.

32:03.875 --> 32:04.917
Oh... oh.
Okay, okay.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.375
All right, well,
I'll speak to you then.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.333
Yeah, you too.
Bye.

32:14.709 --> 32:16.417
"Investment conference"?

32:20.375 --> 32:22.041
Madison.

32:23.959 --> 32:25.959
She took you back, then?

32:26.041 --> 32:28.041
With conditions.

32:28.125 --> 32:31.333
What conditions?

32:31.417 --> 32:35.500
Like, I promised that
I'd leave all this shit behind.

32:37.208 --> 32:40.291
Don't take this
the wrong way, mate,

32:40.375 --> 32:41.709
but you're an idiot.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.792
Satellite link frequency
obtained.

32:46.875 --> 32:48.458
Copy that.

32:48.542 --> 32:50.417
Chetri's got something.

32:54.542 --> 32:56.000
Target interference.

32:56.083 --> 32:57.333
Bring the satellite down.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.834
It will be off trajectory
two, three hundred kilometers.

32:59.917 --> 33:02.834
And if we wait,
we could lose the connection.

33:02.917 --> 33:04.000
Just do it.

33:10.750 --> 33:13.417
Satellite's falling,
two hours till impact.

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
It'll land somewhere in
north Philippines.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.250
I'll get a closer fix
on it soon.

33:17.333 --> 33:18.583
Right, well,
if we move fast enough,

33:18.667 --> 33:21.125
we might be able to get to it
before Pavel.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.208
All right, sounds like a plan.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.583
Boss.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.834
Can we leave Wyatt out of this?

33:28.917 --> 33:29.792
Uh, excuse me?

33:29.875 --> 33:31.542
Technically, you are a civilian.

33:31.625 --> 33:33.417
Technically, I'm also awesome.

33:34.542 --> 33:36.458
We're up against
highly trained Russian

33:36.542 --> 33:38.583
ex-military operatives.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.041
I think Mr. Wyatt's skill set
will come in handy.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.208
Thank you.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.625
At least somebody's happy
to see me.

33:43.709 --> 33:46.375
That's not what I said.
Come on.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.250
Corporal.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.500
Yes, sir.

33:49.583 --> 33:52.041
You're going to the Philippines?

33:52.125 --> 33:54.500
Wha... aren't you taking me
to the hospital?

33:54.583 --> 33:55.709
Not quite, mate.

33:55.792 --> 33:57.125
Hey, what are you doing?

33:57.208 --> 33:58.834
Well, like the boss said,

33:58.917 --> 34:00.792
there's some people
who wanna talk to ya.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.291
Wait.
Which people?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.166
What, the cops?
The SEC?

34:05.250 --> 34:06.542
You'll find out soon enough.

34:06.625 --> 34:08.917
Russia?

34:09.000 --> 34:11.542
Hey, Wyatt, bro, come on.

34:11.625 --> 34:14.000
Look, how does
a big, fat raise sound?

34:14.083 --> 34:16.625
Huh?
I wouldn't know.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.458
You fired me.

34:19.542 --> 34:22.291
Wyatt...

34:22.375 --> 34:24.667
Please!

34:26.166 --> 34:27.375
I have the landing coordinates.

34:27.458 --> 34:29.375
We're done here.

34:31.375 --> 34:35.250
Pavel... they work for Russia.

34:35.333 --> 34:38.625
Yes, they do.

34:42.417 --> 34:44.417
You put down your weapon before.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.583
You told me to.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.166
Yes, but you had a job to do,

34:47.250 --> 34:51.041
to protect the secrets of
Russia from people like us,

34:51.125 --> 34:53.417
but you just rolled over.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.166
You gave up.

34:56.291 --> 35:00.417
You are what is wrong
with our nation.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.083
We have become cowards.

35:02.166 --> 35:03.291
We used to be bold,

35:03.375 --> 35:05.792
but now we only hide
behind computers...

35:06.917 --> 35:09.417
Poking the West,
retreating and denying

35:09.500 --> 35:11.792
when we are discovered.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.041
Pavel...

35:14.667 --> 35:16.458
At least the Americans have
the decency

35:16.542 --> 35:18.041
to bomb their enemies,

35:18.125 --> 35:21.041
then build shopping malls
and fast food restaurants

35:21.125 --> 35:22.166
on the rubble.

35:36.959 --> 35:39.125
Just got a fix on
the satellite trajectory.

35:39.208 --> 35:40.125
And?

35:40.208 --> 35:42.834
And it's coming in hard,
off-course.

35:42.917 --> 35:45.291
Due to land ten miles outside
of Marawi,

35:45.375 --> 35:48.875
by a small shantytown called
Santa Diwa.

35:48.959 --> 35:51.458
That's an ISIL stronghold.

35:51.542 --> 35:55.709
It's basically crashing down
into the middle of a warzone.

36:22.375 --> 36:25.375
Hey.

36:47.166 --> 36:50.000
Bravos, our satellite
imagery confirms that

36:50.083 --> 36:51.875
a package was removed from
the crash site

36:51.959 --> 36:54.458
and taken to an ISIL safe house.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.875
Vehicle entering Santa Diwa

36:57.959 --> 36:59.834
two clicks north
of your location.

37:08.625 --> 37:12.625
ID on Pavel Kuragin
with multiple local Tangos.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.166
Get that package before
Kuragin does.

37:18.250 --> 37:19.333
Copy that.

37:19.417 --> 37:23.417
Multiple Tangos
in your area, stay frosty.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.166
Man, I've missed this.

37:28.792 --> 37:29.959
Moving.

38:04.375 --> 38:06.166
I should be part of
the recovery squad.

38:07.875 --> 38:10.792
If whatever was taken from
that satellite is so important

38:10.875 --> 38:13.875
to the Russians
that they won't tell us,

38:13.959 --> 38:15.959
then I'd rather my team
fetch it without

38:16.041 --> 38:18.083
a Russian Captain looking
over our shoulder.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.083
Of course.

38:23.542 --> 38:27.291
'Cause that's all I am
to this team, "the Russian."

38:30.667 --> 38:33.333
Just stay focused.

38:33.417 --> 38:35.750
You're still on this job.

38:38.375 --> 38:40.166
Eyes on target location.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.166
Go to the door.

39:23.125 --> 39:25.000
Clear.

39:25.083 --> 39:28.041
Clear.
Package secured.

39:28.125 --> 39:29.542
Head to the RV point.

39:29.625 --> 39:32.041
Wait.
What have we got?

39:32.125 --> 39:33.625
Mission's to grab it,
not open it.

39:33.709 --> 39:35.542
They took down a bloody
satellite for it.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.291
You don't wanna have
a sneaky peek?

39:38.959 --> 39:40.250
Yeah, all right.

39:48.583 --> 39:50.166
The hell are they?

39:50.250 --> 39:52.250
Missile launch keys.

39:52.333 --> 39:55.000
Pavel traded a nuke
for missiles?

39:55.083 --> 39:56.542
It doesn't make sense.

39:56.625 --> 39:57.709
Yeah,
what bothers me more is why

39:57.792 --> 39:58.917
you'd keep the keys
on a satellite.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.125
Since the '50s there's been
rumors that both

40:01.208 --> 40:03.250
Russia and the West have been
storing sensitive data

40:03.333 --> 40:04.583
and other shit up there
for safekeeping.

40:04.667 --> 40:06.583
So whatever those are...

40:06.667 --> 40:09.083
- Bad news?
- Very bad news.

40:13.750 --> 40:17.125
Your people have something
that I want.

40:17.208 --> 40:21.959
You bring it to me,
and you can name your price.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.792
The price will be high.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.834
It usually is.

40:38.208 --> 40:42.041
Bravo, multiple Tangos
headed your way.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.667
Oh, great.
Let's go.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.500
Spreading out, searching.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.959
We'll need to move to
emergency RV point.

41:04.041 --> 41:05.250
Move.

41:05.333 --> 41:07.458
Be careful, the whole
downtown's looking for you.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.625
Go, Wyatt.

41:16.709 --> 41:18.375
Moving.
Move, move.

41:28.125 --> 41:31.041
Right, Bravo Two, check right
for exfil, we'll check left.

41:31.125 --> 41:32.709
- Copy.
- Moving.

42:19.208 --> 42:22.625
Tangos prepping,
my route's blocked.

42:36.792 --> 42:37.917
Weapon down.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.208
Don't do it.

42:40.291 --> 42:43.458
Ah!

42:45.166 --> 42:46.917
Fuck's sake, Mac!

42:47.000 --> 42:50.041
All right, possible exfil
this way.

42:50.125 --> 42:51.166
Hey, look, go back inside.

42:51.250 --> 42:52.291
Go back inside.

42:52.375 --> 42:53.333
No, no, no!

42:53.417 --> 42:54.834
- Shit, move, move!
- Moving!

43:14.500 --> 43:17.000
Fuck!

43:17.083 --> 43:19.375
Got your back.

43:19.458 --> 43:20.583
You okay?

43:23.417 --> 43:25.000
- Changing.
- Move.

43:27.542 --> 43:28.500
Move!
Yeah.

43:28.583 --> 43:30.208
Move.
Go, go, go.

43:31.709 --> 43:33.333
- Go left.
- Check it.

43:33.417 --> 43:34.750
Copy.

43:36.875 --> 43:38.542
Get back, get back.

43:39.834 --> 43:40.792
Fuck!
Oh, fuck.

43:40.875 --> 43:43.125
Shit.
Stay down.

43:43.208 --> 43:44.250
Clear!

43:45.875 --> 43:48.000
Let's go, mate.
Go, go, go.

43:53.417 --> 43:54.583
Wyatt, are you okay?

43:54.667 --> 43:57.375
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
arm got tagged.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.208
Let's have a look, mate.

43:59.291 --> 44:00.750
Oh, nice one.

44:00.834 --> 44:03.500
Yeah, I'm not exactly sure
how to explain

44:03.583 --> 44:04.542
this one back home.

44:04.625 --> 44:07.709
Hey, keep the chat
to a minimum, yeah?

44:07.792 --> 44:09.208
It's not what you think.

44:09.291 --> 44:11.333
He was so proud of you,
you know?

44:11.417 --> 44:14.166
That you'd got out,
got a job, a real life.

44:14.250 --> 44:18.125
You coming back,
it kind of broke his heart.

44:18.208 --> 44:19.417
All right,
we're going out the back.

44:19.500 --> 44:21.375
Finish patching him up
and get ready to move.

44:30.417 --> 44:31.458
Shit.

44:31.542 --> 44:33.000
Tangos incoming!
Move!

44:34.792 --> 44:36.709
Go!
Go, go, go!

44:49.750 --> 44:51.542
- Wyatt.
- Yeah?

44:51.625 --> 44:53.458
- Mac.
- Yeah?

44:55.041 --> 44:56.875
- Move!
- One sec.

44:58.250 --> 44:59.375
Moving!

45:04.000 --> 45:05.375
I'm after you.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.041
Changing!

45:18.458 --> 45:19.875
Grenade!
Move!

45:19.959 --> 45:22.208
- Move!
- Move!

45:40.917 --> 45:42.917
Oh, fuck!

45:45.458 --> 45:46.500
No!

45:55.667 --> 45:56.959
Changing!

45:59.667 --> 46:01.583
Move!
Move!

46:01.667 --> 46:03.583
Moving!

46:10.542 --> 46:11.709
Boss!

46:18.875 --> 46:21.917
Go, exfil.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.750
Is that your vehicle, Wyatt?

46:24.834 --> 46:26.041
Come out!

46:26.125 --> 46:27.458
- No!
- Cover!

46:27.542 --> 46:29.583
Move it!

46:29.667 --> 46:30.834
Go, go, go!
Go!

46:30.917 --> 46:32.375
Behind me!

46:35.208 --> 46:37.041
- Boss, let's go.
- Just go.

46:37.125 --> 46:39.000
Meet me at the ERV.
Copy.

46:41.458 --> 46:43.750
- Get in, Mac.
- Move, move, move.

46:55.875 --> 46:58.542
Pick me up, due east,
two minutes.

47:29.959 --> 47:34.125

47:34.208 --> 47:38.917
