WEBVTT

00:20.646 --> 00:22.606
HOST (over radio):
Here on 1030 AM,

00:22.648 --> 00:24.483
the Voice of the Reich.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.403
Peace has come at last
to a war-weary nation

00:27.445 --> 00:30.865
as grateful Americans
from Broadway to Main Street

00:30.906 --> 00:32.700
greet their German liberators.

00:32.742 --> 00:35.202
Recently appointed
Reichsmarschall Erwin Rommel

00:35.244 --> 00:38.539
took to the streets to greet
the adoring American republic.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.374
Citizens everywhere
are welcoming

00:40.416 --> 00:42.543
the return of local
infrastructure:

00:42.585 --> 00:44.545
running water
in their kitchens and baths,

00:44.587 --> 00:46.547
electricity at all hours,

00:46.589 --> 00:48.591
and ready stores
of food supplies

00:48.632 --> 00:51.177
being brought in daily from
the Reich's plentiful bounty.

00:51.218 --> 00:53.429
Citizen volunteers
are invited to join in...

00:53.471 --> 00:54.930
Put on some music, will you?

00:54.972 --> 00:56.432
-Anything but that.
-SMITH: Leave it on.

00:56.474 --> 00:59.935
We need news. Even their news.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.979
-(Thomas crying)
-(shushing)

01:04.774 --> 01:06.901
I can't quiet Thomas.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.736
HOST:
...fresh milk and apples

01:08.778 --> 01:10.321
picked straight
from the orchard.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.199
It's hunger.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.493
I can't even get him
to nurse him anymore.

01:18.496 --> 01:21.290
-We'll get through this.
-(knocking on door)

01:21.290 --> 01:24.001
That's him.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.547
-HELEN (whispers): It's okay.
-(deadbolt clacks open)

01:28.589 --> 01:31.926
(thunder rumbles)

01:39.683 --> 01:41.894
Are you gonna
invite me in, John?

01:49.151 --> 01:51.153
-Hi, Mike.
-Helen.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.739
(Thomas continues crying)

01:53.781 --> 01:56.033
BOLDEN:
As you were.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.683
Take it.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.977
Come on, don't be fools. Eat.

02:23.018 --> 02:26.605
Go on, Helen. Go on.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.405
Here. Warm this up.

02:38.075 --> 02:42.246
BOLDEN:
I just came from the handover
at West Point.

02:42.288 --> 02:44.707
Patton shook hands with Goering.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.750
It's all settled.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.837
The first men to sign on
will get food

02:49.879 --> 02:51.839
and good positions in the Reich.

02:51.881 --> 02:55.134
The holdouts will get nothing.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.428
Or death.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.190
We report for duty tomorrow,

03:10.232 --> 03:13.110
at 0600.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.865
It's up to you.

03:19.909 --> 03:22.870
(door opens, closes)

03:32.504 --> 03:34.298
WITCHCROFT:
It's just a piece of cloth.

03:34.340 --> 03:37.343
Doesn't mean we believe in it.

03:40.012 --> 03:44.391
We do this, we bide our time...

03:44.433 --> 03:47.186
You keep telling
yourself that, pal.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.980
W-We can fight them. John.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.732
They say Ike is gathering men.

03:51.774 --> 03:54.610
-A militia...
-We all saw that bomb.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.073
It was like a thousand suns.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.536
What does it even take
to build something like that?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.538
I mean, you know?

04:06.580 --> 04:12.169
What kind of will, and a vision?

04:12.211 --> 04:14.672
-It's a crime is what it is.
-Well, we'd have built it, too,

04:14.713 --> 04:16.840
if we could, but we couldn't.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.509
Could we?

04:20.552 --> 04:23.347
No. It's over.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.017
It's done.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.646
It failed.

04:30.688 --> 04:35.693
When push came to shove,
the whole thing just collapsed.

04:35.734 --> 04:40.864
What they have, that's...
that works.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.581
What about us, John?

04:52.376 --> 04:55.504
What happens to my family
in the Reich?

05:00.551 --> 05:02.553
I don't know.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.408
It isn't much.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.452
Okay.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.918
Take this, and go.

05:34.960 --> 05:38.630
-Go where, John?
-Well, just as far as you can.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.102
I remember when we would've
died for each other.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.450
(door closes)

06:15.375 --> 06:17.377
(exhales)

06:22.049 --> 06:24.468
None of this is easy.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.305
Mm.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.724
But this is what's right.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.897
It's for us.

06:41.819 --> 06:43.445

Brother Darius,

09:59.725 --> 10:02.519
-this is Elijah.
-Hi.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.855
-And...
-Bell Mallory.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.606
Moulton, Alabama.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.567
That's right.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.985
You got a good memory.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.321
I remember every name,
every place.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.531
You've made a name for yourself,
Bell Mallory.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.284
All of you.

10:17.326 --> 10:21.079
Well, gentlemen,
we've got collard greens.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.124
We've got black-eyed peas, yams,

10:24.166 --> 10:27.127
some cornbread
and sweet green tea.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.254
-Ooh!
-(Bell laughs)

10:29.296 --> 10:32.424
ELIJAH:
You really think
this admiral's on the level?

10:32.466 --> 10:34.092
He's a military man.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.470
He'll be acting on orders
from the royal family.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.848
Probably won't be easy
for him to stomach, but...

10:39.890 --> 10:42.434
he's taking a risk, too.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.479
Is there any chance
the peace will hold?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.607
It's a temporary cease-fire.

10:48.648 --> 10:52.694
I mean, do you think
they'll ever agree to our terms?

10:56.448 --> 11:00.494
This is the first time
in America

11:00.535 --> 11:05.248
or the JPS or the Reich

11:05.290 --> 11:07.709
that anyone has ever negotiated

11:07.751 --> 11:10.337
with a black man as an equal.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.633
That's all we leave with today,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.843
it's a victory.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.348
I remember the first time
I opened a crate

11:21.390 --> 11:25.060
of those Chinese
automatic rifles.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.271
I picked one up.

11:29.272 --> 11:31.650
It was so dark and...

11:31.691 --> 11:34.111
oiled and heavy.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.115
Man, it felt like...

11:40.117 --> 11:43.578
-...power.
-Hmm. Right on, brother.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.042
And from that moment,
all I've dreamed of

11:49.084 --> 11:53.380
is the day I can put
that damn weapon down.

John?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.995
Helen.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.998
Oh, I thought you weren't coming
back until Sunday morning.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.876
-What are you doing here?
-Oh...

12:30.917 --> 12:34.004
I was, uh, thinking
I could surprise you.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.423
Uh, no, I figured, um,

12:36.465 --> 12:38.550
Greensboro could wait
till Monday.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.429
Mother always said I should
marry an ambitious man.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.889
Mmm.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.269
Oh.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.730
I know what you came back for.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.799
-So, uh, Thomas is, um...
-It's Saturday,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.426
remember?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.553
He's due back

13:23.595 --> 13:26.056
in about 45 minutes.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.819
Mmm.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.740
Which is just enough time.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.037
(chuckles)

13:49.079 --> 13:51.081
Come on.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.755
(laughing)

14:01.424 --> 14:03.426
You got a haircut, I see.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.223
(chuckles)

14:08.265 --> 14:11.893
-And you're going gray.
-Am I?

14:11.935 --> 14:13.895

14:13.937 --> 14:16.773

Someone turned up
calling herself Juliana Crain?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.157
Yeah, didn't seem possible,
right?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.617

let you see for yourself.

ZINA (faintly):
What happened to
Himmler and Goring?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.207
And the Nazi leaders?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.460
The Allies, they could've
put them up against a wall

17:23.501 --> 17:25.003
and shot them.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.213
That's what had always been done
when wars ended.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.091
But they decided
to do something different.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.011
They gave them a fair trial.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.847
-Nazis don't deserve a trial.
-Well, they were criminals.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.682
Once they put them
on the stand, the world

17:37.724 --> 17:39.809
could see them
for what they were.

17:39.851 --> 17:42.604
Their crimes were enormous,

17:42.645 --> 17:44.647
but these were small, weak men.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.944
They, um,

17:49.986 --> 17:52.322
they made excuses.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.157
They claimed they didn't know,

17:54.199 --> 17:57.410
that they were helpless
to stop it.

17:57.452 --> 17:59.871
Tell them what happened
to Hitler.

18:03.583 --> 18:08.087
He hid out in a bunker...

18:08.129 --> 18:10.882
and then shot himself
in the head.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.427
It seems impossible. (chuckles)

18:14.469 --> 18:16.971
Like a dream.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.353
If they can be beaten
in that world,

18:23.394 --> 18:26.147
they can be beaten in this one.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.076
Sometimes I wondered, you know,

18:38.117 --> 18:41.162
if you'd ever made it
out of that tunnel.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.915
I was sure you were dead,

18:43.957 --> 18:47.502
and I couldn't let it go.

18:47.544 --> 18:53.299
I knew the films
were what mattered most to you,

18:53.341 --> 18:55.343
to both of us.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.345
So...

18:57.387 --> 19:00.390
I threw myself into...

19:00.431 --> 19:02.475
getting them out there.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.936
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

19:10.817 --> 19:13.403
Reich patrols.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.907
I'd almost forgotten that sound.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.535
We're safe here.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.996
(whirring continues)

19:29.043 --> 19:30.795
(gasps)

19:32.088 --> 19:33.381
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.924
I understand.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.429
It's just that nothing's
fixed in place...

19:39.470 --> 19:42.515
anymore.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.934
You know?

19:44.976 --> 19:48.146
Nothing's solid.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.608
Like everything's just a...

19:51.649 --> 19:54.277
reflection of a reflection.

19:54.319 --> 19:57.280
Does that make sense?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.368
I think so.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.831
It's like being suspended...

20:06.873 --> 20:09.667
(shuddering inhale)

20:09.709 --> 20:11.502
(exhales)

20:11.544 --> 20:14.088
...each existence

20:14.130 --> 20:16.925
as real as the next.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.595
And at which point
do you choose to hold on to one?

20:37.278 --> 20:39.697
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

21:23.324 --> 21:25.326
BELL:
That's him, Elijah.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.093
Keep the motor running.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.600
Iika.

21:49.642 --> 21:50.852
Stay by the car.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.731
Sound the horn at trouble...

21:54.772 --> 21:56.816
then cover me.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.945
Follow me.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.546
EQUIANO:
My father always wanted me

22:18.588 --> 22:20.465
to be a blacksmith.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.384
If you came here expecting

22:23.426 --> 22:27.263
to gain anything
from your attack the other day,

22:27.305 --> 22:29.140
-you will be disappointed.
-I try not

22:29.182 --> 22:31.225
to have any expectations.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.269
That way,
I'm never taken by surprise.

22:33.311 --> 22:35.605
I bring you only a warning.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.608
If you continue
these acts of terror,

22:38.649 --> 22:42.528
Japan will bring
the full force of its military

22:42.570 --> 22:44.989
-to bear on the BCR.
-We learned

22:45.031 --> 22:48.076
about terror
at the hands of your Kempeitai.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.411
You're just upset
you don't have a monopoly

22:50.453 --> 22:51.579
on violence anymore.

22:51.621 --> 22:53.206
I didn't come for a lecture.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.917
You are here to listen
to our side. Am I wrong?

22:57.919 --> 23:00.505
I am listening.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.011
You're facing rebellions
around the world.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.515
India,

23:10.556 --> 23:13.142
China, Australia.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.311
There are millions of us
with everything to gain

23:15.353 --> 23:16.771
and nothing to lose.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.898
Think how hard you would fight

23:18.940 --> 23:22.151
to protect your home islands,
Admiral.

23:22.193 --> 23:24.821
This is our home.

23:26.572 --> 23:29.992
You were brought here as slaves.

23:30.034 --> 23:34.455
No one has endured more for
this country than our people.

23:36.374 --> 23:39.168
We will endure anything
to be free.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.297
What is it you want?

23:47.426 --> 23:49.595
A free state.

23:49.637 --> 23:52.014
Our own territory.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.350
A self-governing republic
for black people.

23:54.392 --> 23:56.477
Your letter offered
a cease-fire.

23:56.519 --> 23:58.479
Temporary cease-fire.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.773
Depending on what you can offer
in return.

24:00.815 --> 24:04.152
I am in no position
to offer anything.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.241
Then take a message
to the Crown Princess.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.827
We'll need a sign of good faith.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.787
Such as?

24:14.829 --> 24:17.248
Stop the Kempeitai round-ups
in the ghetto.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.709
(Inokuchi sighs)

24:21.252 --> 24:23.588
I will see...

24:23.629 --> 24:25.506
what can be done.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.177
INOKUCHI:
Tell me...

24:29.218 --> 24:31.470
why didn't you become
a blacksmith?

24:33.848 --> 24:36.475
I found out
I was afraid of horses.

24:40.146 --> 24:42.732
To this day, I still get sick

24:42.773 --> 24:45.067
the first two days at sea.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.202
What'd he say?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.871
He's a man of war who's trying
to learn to make peace.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.331
But I think
he's someone we can...

24:58.372 --> 25:00.666
(gunshot)

25:01.709 --> 25:02.668
(gunshots)

25:02.710 --> 25:04.503
(shouts indistinctly)

25:04.545 --> 25:06.380
(gasps)

25:06.422 --> 25:07.882
Go, go, go!

25:08.507 --> 25:09.926
Drive, drive!

25:09.967 --> 25:12.511
(gunshots)

25:19.101 --> 25:22.521
(sirens wailing)

25:28.694 --> 25:31.614
(indistinct radio chatter)

25:31.656 --> 25:32.990
Admiral Inokuchi.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.952
Colonel...

25:35.993 --> 25:38.204
I arrest you on the charge
of high treason.

25:38.246 --> 25:39.455
Are you insane?

25:40.539 --> 25:41.791
(handcuffs clicking)

25:48.839 --> 25:51.384
KIDO:
Equiano Hampton is dead.

25:51.425 --> 25:52.927
What about Admiral Inokuchi?

25:52.969 --> 25:54.845
He is in custody.
We will make arrangements

25:54.887 --> 25:58.474
to send him to Tokyo
to face a naval court-martial.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.476
I will accompany him.

26:00.518 --> 26:03.771
No. He will be court-martialed
here in San Francisco.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.773
The Royal Family
may not approve.

26:05.815 --> 26:07.316
This is a military matter.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.610
The Crown Princess
does not need to be involved.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.696
She should be kept insulated,

26:11.737 --> 26:13.572
for her own sake.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.574
Tokyo will be pleased.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.702
With Hampton dead,
Tagomi's killers

26:17.743 --> 26:19.870
-have been brought to justice.
-I am still investigating

26:19.912 --> 26:22.290
-the Tagomi murder.
-YAMORI: I thought I told you

26:22.331 --> 26:24.458
to close the file.

26:25.751 --> 26:28.421
I gave the Crown Princess
my word.

26:28.462 --> 26:31.173
Let's not delude ourselves.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.759
In your 15 years
as chief inspector,

26:33.801 --> 26:36.012
you have planted evidence,

26:36.053 --> 26:37.930
elicited false confessions,

26:37.972 --> 26:41.976
executed suspects without trial.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.186
You have done all this...

26:44.228 --> 26:46.022
why?

26:46.063 --> 26:48.649
Out of loyalty to the cause

26:48.691 --> 26:50.651
of a Japanese San Francisco.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.069
SAITO:
And you gave your son

26:52.111 --> 26:53.738
to that cause as well.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.782
Captain Iijima's told me
about Toru's recent...

26:56.824 --> 26:59.618
incident at the Bamboo Palace.

26:59.660 --> 27:03.414
You chose your path
15 years ago, Kido.

27:03.456 --> 27:05.916
It's too late to change now.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.627
YAMORI:
I look forward

27:08.669 --> 27:12.214
to hearing your testimony
at Inokuchi's court-martial.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.772
(lively music playing
over radio)

27:32.818 --> 27:35.196
(sighs)

27:35.237 --> 27:37.656
Leon got the news
to the Leadership Council.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.658
They've called
an emergency meeting

27:39.700 --> 27:40.993
of all
the Northern California cells.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.079
Best we can do.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.663
(engine starts)

27:44.705 --> 27:48.334
(theme music playing over radio)

27:48.376 --> 27:51.504
NEWSMAN:
The Japanese authority has
confirmed that Equiano Hampton,

27:51.545 --> 27:53.506
the leader
of the Negro terrorist group

27:53.547 --> 27:56.092
known as
the Black Communist Rebellion,

27:56.133 --> 27:57.635
-was killed last night...
-(whispers): Oh, damn it.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.637
...in a daring raid
by Kempeitai forces.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.265
Governor General Yamori praised
the work of Kempeitai officers

28:03.307 --> 28:04.683
in dispensing
swift retribution.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.436
Did we kill him...

28:07.478 --> 28:10.231
-Elijah?
-...late last night in Moraga,

28:10.272 --> 28:12.233
was conducted with zero
Kempeitai casualties...

28:12.274 --> 28:14.693
Were we so...

28:14.735 --> 28:17.363
(crying): hungry for peace
that we moved too fast

28:17.405 --> 28:19.198
-and we ruined everything?
-Nah, nah, he...

28:19.240 --> 28:21.242
he wanted that meeting.

28:21.283 --> 28:24.203
He felt it was a chance
worth taking.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.581
(man continues indistinctly
over radio)

28:36.465 --> 28:37.800
BENJY:
Kempeitai.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.343
Going house to house
rousting brothers,

28:39.385 --> 28:41.137
taking them to camps
out by the docks.

28:41.178 --> 28:43.347
-Just tell me how far are they.
-Fast as they're moving,

28:43.389 --> 28:44.432
20 minutes if we're lucky.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.101
LEON:
Guns, food, ammo--

28:47.143 --> 28:48.644
crate it all up
and load it in the trucks.

28:48.686 --> 28:51.522
If you can't shoot it
or eat it, fuck it.

28:51.564 --> 28:54.817
BENJY:
Leon, is it true what
the radio says about Equiano?

28:54.859 --> 28:56.819
Because I know they lie.
All the time.

28:56.861 --> 28:58.112
-They could be lying right now.
-The Leadership Council's

28:58.154 --> 28:59.488
holding a meeting
for all the local cells.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.198
-We've got to get ready.
-But he's alive, right?

29:01.240 --> 29:02.575
He's coming back
with Bell and Elijah.

29:02.616 --> 29:05.327
He ain't coming back, Benjy.
He's dead.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.579
Let's get this place
cleaned out.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.330
We got to get out of here.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.708
What about him?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.960
-Let's get rid of him.
-Wait.

29:13.002 --> 29:15.087
Wait, wait, wait. What does that
mean, "Let's get rid of him"?

29:15.129 --> 29:16.338
What does that mean?
I helped you.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.048
-You set us up.
-No. I-I...

29:18.090 --> 29:20.259
How was I supposed to know?
I didn't set anybody up.

29:20.301 --> 29:21.969
Yeah, maybe you did,
maybe you didn't,

29:22.011 --> 29:24.680
but I ain't got the time
or the inclination to find out.

29:24.722 --> 29:25.931
Whoa.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.309
Take him outside.
Keep it quiet.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.144
-Use this.
-CHILDAN: Wait a minute.
Just wait.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.396
-Let's go. Let's go!
-Can we just... Wait.

29:35.733 --> 29:38.944
CHILDAN:
(grunts) Listen to me.
Listen to me.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.113
You... you don't have
to do this.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.781
Okay, you don't have to do this.

29:42.823 --> 29:44.283
What do you need?

29:44.325 --> 29:46.035
What do you need?
Do you need money?

29:46.076 --> 29:47.661
-I've got money.
-Shut up!

29:47.703 --> 29:49.079
You can't buy me.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.040
Bragging on your money.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.501
Greedy son of a bitch getting
rich selling junk to the Japs!

29:53.542 --> 29:55.085
No. No, no,
that-that came out wrong.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.879
I'm sorry, I'm not...
I'm not rich.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.673
I'm not rich at all.
I'm... I'm just a...

29:59.715 --> 30:02.218
-(grunts)
-I'm just... I'm just-just a...

30:02.259 --> 30:04.220
a p-person,
a person just like you.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.888
(stammering):
Wha... Y...

30:05.930 --> 30:07.848
What's y...
Your name's Benjy, right?

30:07.890 --> 30:10.100
Isn't that right? Benjy?
Listen, Benjy, Benjy,

30:10.142 --> 30:12.311
-you don't have to do this.
-Shut the fuck up!

30:12.353 --> 30:15.064
Oh, God. Please.
This isn't...

30:15.105 --> 30:16.982
-Get on your knees!
-(yells)

30:18.275 --> 30:19.735
Oh, God, no! Please!

30:19.777 --> 30:21.487
Please, just wait.
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.822
Wait, please, please, please.
Give me a moment. Please.

30:25.282 --> 30:26.909
Tsuyu-to-ochi.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.577
Tsuyu-ni, ki-yé-nishi.

30:28.619 --> 30:30.788
Wagami-kana.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.332
-What are you doing?
-(continues in Japanese)

30:33.374 --> 30:35.417
Tsuyu-ni, ki-yé-nishi.

30:35.459 --> 30:37.127
Wagami-kana.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.004
Yumé-no, mata-yumé.
Tsuyu-to-ochi.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.340
(grunts)

30:41.382 --> 30:43.425
Give me your hand.

30:44.802 --> 30:48.472
Aah! Shit! Shit!
What's that for?

30:48.514 --> 30:49.807
-(groans)
-Go.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.102
Go. Go on. Run.

30:53.143 --> 30:56.772
I don't want
to see your ass here again.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.317
(panting)
Thank you.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.777
Thank you.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.132
Well.

31:23.173 --> 31:25.050
JULIANA:
All right.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.054
You want
to bring us up to speed?

31:30.764 --> 31:32.933
Yeah. Her as well.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.811
I got to be honest,
I, uh, I don't trust her.

31:35.853 --> 31:38.355
Well, as long as I do,
you don't have to.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.691
We're a package deal, see?

31:40.733 --> 31:43.193
It's her, me...

31:43.235 --> 31:45.863
and my big truckload
of fuckin' guns.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.076
All right.

31:51.118 --> 31:52.953
(clears throat)
Well, we got a...

31:52.995 --> 31:56.332
number of operations on the
board in the planning stages.

31:56.373 --> 31:57.916
You're talking about the portal.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.793
Yeah, we've got it
under observation.

31:59.835 --> 32:02.338
But, uh, they've fortified it
heavily in the past year,

32:02.379 --> 32:05.215
so us moving on it now
would require a major assault.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.800
(quietly):
Yeah, I think so.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.218
What about John Smith?

32:08.260 --> 32:09.595
BELLOWS:
His apartment building

32:09.637 --> 32:11.722
is a fortress,
so we're gonna need to, uh,

32:11.764 --> 32:13.182
catch him in transit in order

32:13.223 --> 32:14.725
to make an attempt on him.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.060
Of course,
that's gonna mean intelligence

32:16.101 --> 32:17.978
on his movements.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.648
-Where were these photos
of Helen taken?
-She was living

32:20.689 --> 32:23.567
in the Neutral Zone for the
past year with her daughters.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.402
We were gonna make
an approach on her.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.571
-And what stopped you?
-We were waiting
for your shipment

32:27.613 --> 32:29.073
when Helen
went back to New York.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.200
Wait a minute, what was
she doing in the Neutral Zone

32:31.241 --> 32:32.493
-to begin with?
-I don't know.

32:32.534 --> 32:33.952
Hardly matters now.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.914
Well, it absolutely matters.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.041
Look, Helen Smith
is a woman who's...

32:39.083 --> 32:40.876
lost a child.

32:40.918 --> 32:44.713
No one lives through
that experience unchanged.

32:44.755 --> 32:48.258
And very few marriages, if any,
survive that unchanged, either.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.260
So if she left
for the Neutral Zone,

32:50.302 --> 32:52.846
she had to have been desperate.

32:52.888 --> 32:55.140
And if there's a crack
in that marriage...

32:55.182 --> 32:56.684
that's a way in.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.519
BELLOWS:
That's all soap opera now.

32:58.560 --> 33:00.396
None of that matters now.
We lost her.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.147
She went back to her husband.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.567
Maybe she went back by choice.

33:07.277 --> 33:10.698
Maybe she went back
because she had no choice.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.534
(elevator bell dings)

33:13.575 --> 33:15.994
(chuckles): I'm sorry.
I think there's been a mistake.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.580
How did you get access
to this floor?

33:18.622 --> 33:20.165
There's no mistake, Helen.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.583
My name is Martha.

33:21.625 --> 33:24.378
I'll be your wife-companion.

33:24.420 --> 33:26.672
-Excuse me?
-It is my duty

33:26.714 --> 33:29.216
to discreetly accompany you

33:29.258 --> 33:32.428
on all of your public outings.

33:32.469 --> 33:35.013
For your personal security.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.141
Who sent you here?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.685
We're a service
of the Staatspolizei,

33:39.727 --> 33:41.937
formed to...
meet the unique needs

33:41.979 --> 33:44.148
of the First Families
of the Party.

33:44.189 --> 33:46.608
But we can be
much more than that.

33:46.650 --> 33:50.237
Hmm. The Reichsmarschall called
you here to keep an eye on me

33:50.279 --> 33:53.449
while he's out of town
on business, is that it?

33:53.490 --> 33:55.826
Or is this more than that?

33:55.868 --> 33:58.871
Many Reich wives
come to view their...

33:58.912 --> 34:01.165
wife-companion as a confidant.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.500
There are so few people

34:03.542 --> 34:06.378
a Reichsmarschall's wife
can talk to, after all.

34:06.420 --> 34:10.799
Tell the Staatspolizei
that I don't need a companion.

34:10.841 --> 34:13.385
I understand completely.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.053
I can follow at a distance.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.431
You won't even know I was there.

34:17.473 --> 34:19.767
(lively country intro plays)

34:19.808 --> 34:21.935
ALT-THOMAS:
You couldn't hold a tune
to save your life

34:21.977 --> 34:24.354
-this morning.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.815
And what's with... singing
from the hymnal, anyway?

34:26.857 --> 34:28.817
You know all those songs
by heart.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.819
♪ Missing you... ♪

34:30.861 --> 34:33.572
Just getting old, I guess.

34:33.614 --> 34:37.034
Oh, um, lumberjack breakfast.
With bacon.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.911
Yeah. Uh, coffee, black.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.245
Um, dry toast.

34:44.208 --> 34:47.836
(clears throat)
Um... there's...

34:47.878 --> 34:51.048
something I wanted
to talk to you about,

34:51.089 --> 34:53.509
-now that I've got you alone.
-Okay.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.263
Go ahead.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.349
I talked to my recruiter
yesterday.

35:00.390 --> 35:03.560
And look, I know
you're against it, 'cause...

35:03.602 --> 35:05.354
What is it I'm against?

35:05.395 --> 35:07.439
Me enlisting. The Marines.

35:07.481 --> 35:10.776
The-the war. All of it.

35:10.818 --> 35:13.737
If you're talking about going
to this war in Indochina--

35:13.779 --> 35:16.907
in, uh, Vietnam--

35:16.949 --> 35:20.536
-yeah, I'm against it.
-I'm 18 now, Dad.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.287
-I don't need your permission.
-Well, you asked me.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.665
My answer's very simple:
I don't want you to go.

35:24.706 --> 35:28.126
-But you fought the Japs...
-I don't want to lose you again.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.128
-Again?
-If you go...

35:31.338 --> 35:33.298
...you're gonna die.

35:33.340 --> 35:35.384
What makes you so certain
I'm gonna die?

35:35.425 --> 35:37.302
You came back.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.304
You came back a hero.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.265
Is that what this is about?

36:03.370 --> 36:05.581
WOMAN:
We'd each like scrambled eggs,

36:05.622 --> 36:07.332
biscuits and gravy, please.

36:07.374 --> 36:09.209
Our money's right here,

36:09.251 --> 36:10.711
with extra for the tip.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.212
MAN:
Look,

36:12.254 --> 36:13.797
we don't want trouble.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.674
WOMAN:
Neither do we.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.345
Why don't you
go around the back?

36:20.387 --> 36:22.180
I'll give you some food
to take home with you.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.391
No, sir. We mean to eat
our Sunday breakfast

36:24.433 --> 36:28.645
right here at the counter
like everybody else.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.148
On the Lord's day, no less.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.317
MAN:
I'm trying to run
a respectable business.

36:33.358 --> 36:36.194
You Negro agitators come in here
making good people angry.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.530
-WOMAN: We got a right.
The law says so.
-Don't get involved.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.742
MAN:
There's the laws
they make in D.C.,

36:41.783 --> 36:44.328
and there's the way things are
in this town.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.705
Some things don't change.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.875
This is what happens

36:49.917 --> 36:52.502
when you let 'em run wild.

37:17.986 --> 37:22.366
SHERIFF:
Stand up and step away
from the counter, please.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.034
You, too, boy.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.411
(handcuffs clicking)

37:26.453 --> 37:29.039
Ow.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.586
Let's go.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.550
(indistinct chatter)

37:51.979 --> 37:53.939
(exhales)

37:53.981 --> 37:55.774
What?

37:56.817 --> 37:59.236
I don't know.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.738
I'm just surprised, I guess.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.699
I would have thought

38:03.740 --> 38:05.242
you'd have done something.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.077
Well, what would I do?

38:07.119 --> 38:08.453
Said something.

38:08.495 --> 38:10.455
Done something.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.790
We're not the law.

38:11.832 --> 38:14.251
Come on, it's not up to us.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.462
Just seems so wrong.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.465
They passed a law

38:20.507 --> 38:23.260
that gives the right to these
people to eat at the counter.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.804
And this still happens?

38:25.846 --> 38:28.682
So, this is the system
you want to lay down

38:28.724 --> 38:30.267
your life to defend, huh?

38:30.308 --> 38:33.687
This is the system
that you fought for.

38:33.729 --> 38:35.772
And I came back a hero.
Is that what you think?

38:36.815 --> 38:38.150
That's what I thought you were.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.401
Is that what you want to be?

38:39.443 --> 38:41.028
You want to be a hero?

38:41.069 --> 38:43.488
You want to have your face
painted on a mural?

38:43.530 --> 38:45.157
Maybe have a school
named after you?

38:45.198 --> 38:46.908
You'd still be dead, Thomas.

38:46.950 --> 38:49.453
-How can you be sure?
-Because I've seen it before.

38:49.494 --> 38:50.787
I know how it ends.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.581
And even if you don't die,

38:52.622 --> 38:54.541
you're gonna come back,
you're not gonna be the same.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.628
It's all bullshit, Thomas.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.505
It's a fucking lie.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.258
Medals, flags, anthems.

39:03.300 --> 39:04.926
Pledges of allegiance.

39:04.968 --> 39:06.428
Freedom.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.555
I look around me,
I don't see freedom.

39:08.597 --> 39:10.307
I don't see order.
I just see chaos.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.185
I don't see anything
worth giving my son's life for.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.358
Who are you?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.402
Thomas. Tho...

39:31.578 --> 39:33.538
(sighs)

39:39.169 --> 39:41.171
(door opens, bell rings)

40:00.649 --> 40:02.651
(sighs)

40:21.169 --> 40:23.130
Yukiko?

40:23.171 --> 40:25.257
It's you. You're here.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.758
(chuckles):
Childan.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.302
I was so worried.

40:35.642 --> 40:37.644
Your hand.

40:37.686 --> 40:41.148
Oh, it's all right.
The bleeding stopped.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.568
It needs to be cleaned
and bandaged.

40:47.404 --> 40:49.406
No, but... you're not hurt,
are you?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.866
No.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.493
I came here after it happened.

40:57.581 --> 41:00.333
I didn't know
where else to find you.

41:02.544 --> 41:04.546
The police were here
looking for you.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.138
They did this.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.522
Huh.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.149
(chuckles)

41:26.193 --> 41:29.446
This was a Favrile anemone vase.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.448
One of eight.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.283
Sorry.

41:33.325 --> 41:35.076
-I couldn't stop them.
-No.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.453
L-Look, it doesn't even matter.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.829
(glass breaks)

41:37.871 --> 41:39.247
Oops.

41:39.289 --> 41:41.291
(laughs)

41:45.253 --> 41:47.672
Be still now, Childan.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.052
(Childan inhales sharply)

41:52.093 --> 41:53.720
Mm.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.472
It's all right.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.893
Kempeitai will come back.

41:59.935 --> 42:01.895
You have to hide.

42:04.105 --> 42:06.066
ALT-HELEN:
He walked home?

42:06.107 --> 42:07.901
-Why?
-We had an argument.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.945
I-I said some things.

42:09.986 --> 42:11.863
I don't want him
to make a mistake.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.657
What kind of mistake?

42:13.698 --> 42:15.450
-He wants to join the Marines.
-"Bullshit."

42:15.492 --> 42:16.952
That's what you called it.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.495
-Thomas.
-It was just talk, right?

42:18.536 --> 42:20.497
Everything
that you raised me on.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.041
Freedom. America.

42:23.083 --> 42:24.334
It's all just talk for you.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.086
Well, I believe in it.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.340
Thomas.

42:31.508 --> 42:34.511
Joining the Marines is just not
an option, okay?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.263
Your mom is gonna need you.

42:36.304 --> 42:37.555
-Why?
-ALT-HELEN: John?

42:37.597 --> 42:39.516
A word.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.309
(Smith sighs)

42:41.351 --> 42:43.270
Just leave it.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.105
He's 18 years old.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.065
You know that if you argue with
him, he's just gonna dig in.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.858
Just leave it for another day.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.152
I don't have another day.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.487
Thomas,

42:52.529 --> 42:53.780
listen, I know what it means

42:53.822 --> 42:55.407
to believe in your country,
okay?

42:55.448 --> 42:57.450
(doorbell rings)

42:59.494 --> 43:02.289
What's that?
Were we expecting someone?

43:02.330 --> 43:04.332
It's game day, John.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.340
Hey, pal.

43:12.382 --> 43:13.967
You okay?

43:14.009 --> 43:15.802
Look like someone
just punched you in the gut.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.721
Yeah, I'm fine.

43:17.762 --> 43:19.889
We're not gonna watch

43:19.931 --> 43:22.851
Y.A. Tittle beat the Redskins
from the front porch.

43:23.893 --> 43:26.646
Good to see you, Danny.

43:31.943 --> 43:33.236
ALT-DANIEL:
Hey, champ.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.322
Hey.

43:35.363 --> 43:37.824
-Helen.
-Hi.

43:37.866 --> 43:39.284
You look lovely.

43:39.326 --> 43:42.329
Aw. Always the charmer.

43:45.582 --> 43:46.750
ALT-DANIEL:
What do you say, Tommy?

43:46.791 --> 43:48.793
How you like our chances today?

43:48.835 --> 43:52.547
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

43:52.589 --> 43:54.799
Come on, buck up.

43:54.841 --> 43:57.844
He drives all the way down here
just to see you.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.266
(cheering and applause over TV)

44:06.269 --> 44:08.646
ALT-DANIEL:
You can call him
a broken-down old man

44:08.688 --> 44:10.148
all you want, John,
but it'd be a crime

44:10.190 --> 44:12.650
to put Gary Wood in for Y.A.

44:12.692 --> 44:14.652
If it hadn't been
for the bad hit at Wrigley,

44:14.694 --> 44:17.072
he'd have brought the title home
to New York.

44:17.113 --> 44:19.324
There's such a thing as loyalty.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.328
Right, Thomas?

44:25.955 --> 44:28.708
Besides,
if Y.A. can do it at his age,

44:28.750 --> 44:30.585
there's still hope for us.

44:31.961 --> 44:33.922
You sure you're all right, John?

44:33.963 --> 44:37.675
I mean, you look like somebody
walked over your grave.

44:37.717 --> 44:39.719
I'm sorry.

44:41.638 --> 44:44.182
I'm gonna have to ask you

44:44.224 --> 44:46.059
to excuse me, Daniel.

44:46.101 --> 44:48.395
I, uh, I don't feel very well.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.563
ALT-HELEN:
John.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.273
I should go.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.317
No, Dan. Please, stay.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.610
Join us for dinner.

44:55.652 --> 44:57.654
It's all right, Helen.

45:15.088 --> 45:17.090
Danny.

45:22.887 --> 45:25.807
You know I had no choice, right?

45:26.766 --> 45:29.436
What do you mean, John?

45:29.477 --> 45:31.813
(sighs) It's no use.
It's no use.

45:31.855 --> 45:33.940
I...

45:33.982 --> 45:35.984
You're not gonna understand.

45:38.528 --> 45:40.530
I'm sorry.

45:40.572 --> 45:42.282
Hey.

45:42.323 --> 45:46.119
Hey, we're brothers, right?

45:46.161 --> 45:48.746
You got nothing
to feel sorry for.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.258
I got you.

46:37.879 --> 46:39.881
(engine starts)

46:53.645 --> 46:55.522
DANIEL (quietly):
John. Hey.

46:55.563 --> 46:57.524
John! It's me.

46:57.565 --> 46:59.108
It's Danny.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.277
Daniel?

47:01.319 --> 47:02.654
You got to get us out of here.
Just...

47:02.695 --> 47:05.532
The latch, John.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.784
Just... just lift it.
We'll slip out up the road.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.035
Nobody will know.

47:09.077 --> 47:10.245
Let us out.

47:10.286 --> 47:12.038
Just open the la... the latch.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.540
-Just lift the latch.
-BOLDEN: Smith.

47:15.583 --> 47:17.377
I want you in this briefing.

47:17.418 --> 47:18.711
DANIEL:
Please.

47:18.753 --> 47:20.755
John.

47:22.048 --> 47:23.508
Please, John.

47:23.550 --> 47:25.093
John, it's me.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.678
It's me, Danny.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.431
-MAN: Don't leave us in here.
-DANIEL: Please, John.

47:30.473 --> 47:32.809
-MAN: Help. We have children.
-Don't leave us like this.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.019
(engine revs)

47:35.061 --> 47:36.229
Please, help us!

47:36.271 --> 47:38.398
John!

47:38.439 --> 47:40.525
John, open the latch!
John! John!

47:40.567 --> 47:42.694
-The latch, John!
-John!

47:42.735 --> 47:45.029
Johnny!

47:45.071 --> 47:47.865
We were brothers! John!

47:47.907 --> 47:50.410
John!

47:50.451 --> 47:51.911
John...

47:53.955 --> 47:55.957
(faintly):
John!

47:58.585 --> 48:00.712
(echoing):
John!
