02:50.897 --> 02:54.897
AdiÃ³s, Miss Isabelle. I finish now.

02:54.980 --> 02:59.522
- Have I distracted you, David? - No... No Miss.

02:59.938 --> 03:03.438
The pool clean. I see you tomorrow.

03:04.438 --> 03:08.355
- See you tomorrow David. - Hasta luego.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.812
The dinner is ready.

04:35.728 --> 04:38.770
You look lovely tonight.

04:38.853 --> 04:44.811
It's a shame you can not see, because I'm actually pretty tonight.

04:44.895 --> 04:48.436
I know. You smell ready for mating.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.436
- Bill ... - You probably have no panties at you.

04:52.519 --> 04:55.394
- You'll have to wait and see. - Why wait?

04:55.478 --> 04:57.769
I have not finished eating yet.

05:03.644 --> 05:06.019
Chicken stew was very good.

05:06.102 --> 05:10.436
- It was a rabbit. - Rabbit? Hell.

05:10.519 --> 05:16.019
- You liked it, you can access the all up. - You bought a fucking rabbit.

05:16.102 --> 05:18.727
- Do not be silly. - Never buy rabbit.

05:18.811 --> 05:24.519
- Take no shit boot, Bill. - Soon I shoot a rabbit motherfucker.

05:24.602 --> 05:27.477
Kiss Me.

06:57.808 --> 07:01.600
Well ... Would you fuck him?

07:08.100 --> 07:10.100
Do you want that?

07:12.100 --> 07:14.933
And.

07:15.016 --> 07:19.558
- Should not I? - Sure.

07:19.641 --> 07:23.308
Nice body.

07:23.391 --> 07:26.808
He jerks safely in front of the mirror.

07:30.391 --> 07:31.891
Stop.

07:34.683 --> 07:36.974
Are you jealous?

07:37.058 --> 07:41.766
Not an idiot with stylish magrutor. I have to.

07:41.849 --> 07:44.057
You're jealous.

07:44.141 --> 07:49.432
I'm not jealous, but I do not like the handsome hell.

07:51.682 --> 07:54.391
I just want to play with him.

08:20.557 --> 08:23.640
You'll do better next time.

09:45.847 --> 09:47.097
David?

10:07.721 --> 10:12.804
I forgot sunglasses and book there. Can you get them for me?

10:12.888 --> 10:16.304
SÃ­.Dina sunglasses and your book.

10:16.388 --> 10:18.596
Tack.

10:54.137 --> 10:56.720
It will eachother.

10:56.803 --> 10:59.845
- Hit? - Are you expecting?

11:00.845 --> 11:03.137
I'm not here.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.428
I wish you could change your mind.

11:09.511 --> 11:12.595
It will shine brightly, baby. That is what counts.

12:14.718 --> 12:16.760
Surprised?

12:16.843 --> 12:21.427
- What do you want? - A cup of tea would be nice.

12:22.302 --> 12:26.260
I have traveled far.

12:26.343 --> 12:31.426
Have you lived here long? You have not put your mark on the place.

12:31.510 --> 12:35.343
- Are you moving soon? - This is my home.

12:35.593 --> 12:40.551
How much longer? He feels apparently not so good.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.385
What is it you want, Lucas?

13:18.717 --> 13:23.217
- You should go. - But I just got here.

13:23.467 --> 13:27.259
When he comes back, you can say that I stay for a few days.

13:27.342 --> 13:29.842
Tell me I'm an old friend.

13:29.925 --> 13:35.425
It may sound a little too unbelievable. How about ... a former lover?

13:36.467 --> 13:39.717
Well, then maybe it gets a little strange.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.675
Slaughter. Yes, genealogy!

13:42.758 --> 13:46.842
You choose -bror, cousin, in-law ...

13:46.925 --> 13:49.050
You will probably think of something.

13:50.341 --> 13:53.133
Otherwise?

13:54.841 --> 13:57.133
Read it.

14:00.758 --> 14:03.133
And this.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.633
What does it say?

14:06.716 --> 14:09.508
The Testament was illegal.

14:09.591 --> 14:11.924
Where's decision to seize property.

14:12.008 --> 14:15.716
And this is a request to open the investigation again.

14:15.799 --> 14:19.799
Not so accurate after all. You will not escape.

14:19.882 --> 14:25.716
Right. And this ... is a gift to your current one.

14:27.049 --> 14:29.716
He probably wants to see you in action. Or is he svartis?

14:29.799 --> 14:32.799
It would be pure evil.

14:32.882 --> 14:37.715
He knows I have a past. We do not make a deal out of it.

14:40.049 --> 14:46.090
Did you want to just tell you this, or are you hoping for an agreement?

14:47.549 --> 14:51.590
I'm looking for so much more than an agreement.

14:54.173 --> 14:56.923
I'm ready now, Miss Isabelle.

14:58.340 --> 15:00.507
Okay, David.

15:00.590 --> 15:03.132
Could I have some water?

15:16.298 --> 15:20.423
- Is everything okay? - Yes. Thanks.

15:21.423 --> 15:23.756
See you tomorrow.

15:27.548 --> 15:30.881
Say what you want, Lucas. Take only.

15:30.964 --> 15:36.006
I was honest from the beginning, and then it was no problem.

15:38.381 --> 15:40.756
Your father was a nice man.

15:42.047 --> 15:44.547
You were just a fuck like everybody else.

15:45.547 --> 15:48.381
I did not come here because I like you.

15:50.006 --> 15:52.214
You must be Lucas.

15:56.880 --> 15:59.422
We've been waiting for you.

15:59.505 --> 16:04.255
Can not you stay for dinner. Like the rabbit?

16:06.547 --> 16:09.797
Isabelle laws of a sovereign stew.

16:19.213 --> 16:22.672
Crushed her your heart?

16:22.755 --> 16:25.005
What makes you think that?

16:25.088 --> 16:29.130
You've traveled all this way, so she must be important to you.

16:33.671 --> 16:38.338
- Have you known her long? - For a few years.

16:38.421 --> 16:42.879
- Long enough, that is. - Do you wonder if we've been intimate?

16:42.963 --> 16:45.296
Yes we have.

16:49.796 --> 16:53.504
I know you've been intimate with my wife.

16:53.588 --> 16:59.504
I was wondering if you knew her, if you knew you on her.

16:59.587 --> 17:03.504
She may be many things to many people.

17:04.628 --> 17:07.128
But she is honest.

17:07.212 --> 17:10.587
Sincere. No bullshit.

17:10.671 --> 17:15.087
So either you're an asshole, or just downright stupid.

17:16.128 --> 17:19.587
You have drawn hasty conclusions about me.

17:19.670 --> 17:23.128
Either she fucked you sexets sake -

17:23.212 --> 17:25.545
- Or because she liked you.

17:25.628 --> 17:28.879
If she liked you, and you lost her so quickly -

17:28.962 --> 17:32.420
- Then you're a real asshole.

17:32.503 --> 17:38.295
It was enough for sexets sake, and you thought: "It might be something more."

17:38.378 --> 17:41.003
Thus, you are stupid.

17:41.087 --> 17:44.545
Here I sit with my preconceptions -

17:44.628 --> 17:47.795
- When I really should give you a chance.

17:48.045 --> 17:52.920
So ... which is it? Swine or stupid?

17:54.420 --> 17:57.961
Why can not I be both?

17:58.045 --> 18:01.378
I like you. Though I should not.

18:02.711 --> 18:06.211
You've come all this way to fuck with my wife.

18:06.294 --> 18:12.211
Probably for revenge. It is not very friendly.

18:12.336 --> 18:15.503
The first thing I do is give you a knife.

18:15.586 --> 18:18.044
How do you know why I'm here?

18:18.336 --> 18:21.836
Because I can smell your idiocy.

18:27.794 --> 18:30.794
She will trick you into everything you own.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.585
You know that, right?

18:33.669 --> 18:37.460
Do not worry about me. I'm an adult.

18:39.669 --> 18:43.044
I do not think he stops, Bill.

18:43.335 --> 18:46.085
We must behave civilized.

18:46.169 --> 18:50.043
Talk rebuke him and send him home on a full stomach.

18:50.127 --> 18:53.668
He has come a long way to meet you.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.918
- You're pretty adept with the knife. - I have skinned animals before.

19:14.001 --> 19:15.876
- I am you? - No.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.710
Do you only dirty work?

19:18.793 --> 19:22.418
Everyone should know what it's like to hunt, to wait out their prey -

19:22.501 --> 19:28.084
- To feel the connection with nature and the animal in sight.

19:28.168 --> 19:34.084
And then decide whether to take its life. To award death. Fundamentally.

19:34.376 --> 19:38.501
Is not it dangerous to walk in the mountains and shoot when you are half blind?

19:38.584 --> 19:42.959
Not for me. It's my fucking mountain.

19:45.001 --> 19:50.209
Enough with the small talk. You said you came to collect a debt.

19:50.292 --> 19:54.292
Tell us what you think she owes you.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.875
That was what I wanted to discuss.

19:58.792 --> 20:00.750
Go ahead and discuss.

20:06.209 --> 20:09.292
You took everything my father would have left me.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.458
I want the money back.

20:11.542 --> 20:16.708
All I inherited from him was his, not yours.

20:17.750 --> 20:23.458
He came from nothing. He inherited nothing.

20:23.541 --> 20:27.208
Unearned wealth is a burden he wanted you to avoid carrying.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.083
So damn thoughtful.

20:30.208 --> 20:34.000
And what you deserved my legacy really?

20:34.083 --> 20:37.125
By letting an old man fuck you and believe that you were in love with him?

20:37.250 --> 20:39.416
Han var min make.

20:39.499 --> 20:43.499
And he was ten times more man than you. He left you nothing -

20:43.583 --> 20:47.416
- Because he felt it was the only way for you to change your life.

20:48.416 --> 20:52.499
He wanted you to succeed on your own, just like him.

20:55.999 --> 21:02.499
With that bullshit you explain why my mother did not get anything?

21:02.582 --> 21:05.041
His wife for 37 years.

21:05.124 --> 21:09.291
Why is a year with you is worth more than 37 with the woman who gave him a son?

21:09.374 --> 21:12.499
Your mother got a good deal through the divorce.

21:12.582 --> 21:17.499
- There he left me was his. - Okay, we probably will not get anywhere here.

21:17.582 --> 21:21.707
You got a good education and you have had many wonderful opportunities.

21:21.790 --> 21:28.165
- What is your point? - What do you do after all the possibilities?

21:28.290 --> 21:32.373
Bitterly clinging you stick to this girl -

21:32.457 --> 21:34.665
- In the hope that she will give you -

21:34.748 --> 21:37.498
- It is not your father wanted you to have.

21:37.582 --> 21:39.832
Were it not for her money would have been mine.

21:39.915 --> 21:45.081
I hardly believe that they had ever fallen to you.

21:45.206 --> 21:49.123
What can you do about it now? Nothing.

21:49.206 --> 21:52.123
Does it bother you that she does not only want to access your money?

21:52.248 --> 21:55.081
She's richer than I am.

21:57.706 --> 22:02.581
She's beautiful, she's smart and she's genuine.

22:02.664 --> 22:06.831
Do you know how hard it is to find someone who loves you when you are rich?

22:06.914 --> 22:11.623
Imagine yourself in her shoes together with someone pauper ...

22:11.706 --> 22:15.206
She buys his clothes, inviting him at the restaurant, paying the bills ...

22:15.289 --> 22:21.081
Whilst his balls shrink because he can not support her.

22:21.164 --> 22:23.206
He is not her equal.

22:23.331 --> 22:26.831
And all he could give her, she can pay for.

22:26.914 --> 22:31.372
So when he stops feeling like a man, for he does ...

22:33.705 --> 22:37.039
Money kills, golden boy. Believe me.

22:38.039 --> 22:43.080
Now that I've made that clear to you, you understand -

22:43.164 --> 22:46.455
- That you can not threaten our relationship -

22:46.538 --> 22:50.788
- By drawing up shit from the past.

22:50.872 --> 22:56.997
With that said maybe we can go out tomorrow and see what Lucas is a man.

22:58.580 --> 23:02.955
Until then ... Now it's time to sleep for me.

23:06.413 --> 23:08.663
Nattinatti.

23:39.412 --> 23:43.746
- How are you? - I'm thinking.

23:44.871 --> 23:49.704
- If? - Idiot visit.

23:53.370 --> 23:58.245
- Do you feel sorry? - Not at all.

23:58.329 --> 24:02.745
He deserves everything he will be subjected to.

24:23.953 --> 24:27.578
You did not think I managed to shoot those rabbits?

24:29.786 --> 24:32.995
- Make it Isabelle? - Maybe.

25:26.160 --> 25:30.035
Good morning, miss. Should I continue with the wall?

25:52.785 --> 25:56.284
There are three.

25:56.368 --> 25:58.701
Are you sure?

25:58.784 --> 26:04.034
Not directly, but it sounded like five or six when they fell to the ground.

26:04.118 --> 26:08.868
- Yes, but there are three. - So keep looking.

26:45.950 --> 26:48.075
Do you see it?

26:49.075 --> 26:52.950
Feel how you have his life in your hands.

27:00.700 --> 27:02.658
Why you said so?

27:02.741 --> 27:06.533
So that you are aware that you take a life.

27:10.075 --> 27:13.283
Just as I thought. You are a spoiled rich man's kid -

27:13.366 --> 27:16.491
- Who are too cowardly to kill the food you eat.

27:17.408 --> 27:19.658
There you go, prove me wrong.

27:24.408 --> 27:28.533
I am known for my misjudgment of people.

27:28.616 --> 27:31.866
It can be my two previous wives happily testify.

28:07.323 --> 28:12.532
It must have been a crazy experience to have sex with his stepmother.

28:14.365 --> 28:19.698
You thought of course that it was wrong that she was an old man.

28:19.781 --> 28:23.906
I do not think she ever loved him.

28:23.990 --> 28:29.490
Being deceived by a beautiful girl.

28:29.740 --> 28:33.156
Any old fool he was.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.448
What kind of a girl who behaves like that?

28:37.531 --> 28:42.656
- She does not even know what love is. - But you do?

28:42.739 --> 28:47.698
It would be more honest if you paid her a daily fee.

28:47.781 --> 28:51.739
It's a little too unsophisticated for my taste.

28:51.822 --> 28:56.239
What did you feel for her while you fucked with each other?

28:58.031 --> 29:01.114
I know what she went for.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.697
A dishonest business deal.

29:03.781 --> 29:07.322
You offered never paying her?

29:10.030 --> 29:13.822
Did she ever she loved you?

29:13.905 --> 29:15.780
No.

29:15.864 --> 29:20.280
She never said "I love you"?

29:20.364 --> 29:22.155
No.

29:22.280 --> 29:27.030
She lay with you more than three times?

29:27.113 --> 29:29.780
No, only three.

29:29.863 --> 29:33.488
Did it that you felt exploited?

29:36.905 --> 29:40.030
Behave more like a man next time.

31:03.361 --> 31:07.445
Bring something to drink, bathe and relax.

31:07.528 --> 31:10.861
Feel at home. We eat dinner later.

31:52.110 --> 31:56.402
I'm doing fine. It is good.

32:05.527 --> 32:10.735
They behave strangely. Invited me to dinner.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.735
Still, I have not said how much I want, but ...

32:15.818 --> 32:18.943
Come on, it was ages ago.

32:19.026 --> 32:22.276
It meant nothing then, and nothing has happened since.

32:22.360 --> 32:26.443
Obviously, I just came here to make money and take care of us.

32:26.526 --> 32:30.901
How many times must I repeat the same damn thing?

32:36.693 --> 32:38.984
I know, I hear it.

32:39.068 --> 32:43.651
Yes ... It is best that you go and give her food.

32:47.359 --> 32:51.776
I'll let you know if anything changes.

32:51.859 --> 32:54.484
I love you too.

34:52.107 --> 34:54.440
- Yes? - May I speak with you?

34:54.523 --> 34:58.481
- Yes. - I do not want to lose the job.

34:58.565 --> 35:03.481
- I need money ... - Calm, you do not lose the job.

35:03.565 --> 35:06.731
He understands me.

35:06.815 --> 35:10.398
Does not he ... angry?

35:11.898 --> 35:15.981
You do not get fired because I choose to be with you.

35:16.064 --> 35:18.148
Okay?

35:22.606 --> 35:24.856
One more time?

35:27.397 --> 35:31.064
- Last time? - Make sure that it will be good.

36:37.521 --> 36:40.979
What is required for you to leave us alone?

36:41.063 --> 36:44.771
- Give me what belongs to me. - Do we have to go through this again?

36:44.854 --> 36:46.937
Then we'll see you in court.

36:47.021 --> 36:51.729
We have been very accommodating and fair means. Where no pig.

36:51.812 --> 36:55.729
Are you threatening me? Or is it just your cheap jaw that makes it sound like that?

36:55.979 --> 36:59.521
- Go to hell. - You do not let urbane when you are angry.

36:59.604 --> 37:03.229
- You fucking snob. - Our conversation always ends in quarrels -

37:03.354 --> 37:05.812
- Because you can not stand to be called simple.

37:05.895 --> 37:08.770
You need not be so mean.

37:08.854 --> 37:12.229
This is surely no discussion.

37:12.312 --> 37:16.812
It's so fucking obvious. You stole my heritage, I want it back.

37:18.562 --> 37:22.395
You really should go now.

37:22.478 --> 37:24.895
This will never end well.

37:25.853 --> 37:30.395
Bill want us to sort it out. He wants me to stop.

37:33.853 --> 37:36.936
Okay then. Stay.

37:40.978 --> 37:45.561
He can not get to you. It told the lawyer.

37:45.645 --> 37:49.894
- Not a hundred percent. - You're safe.

37:50.144 --> 37:53.644
The letters are just wishes and challenges.

37:53.728 --> 37:58.019
They have no evidence, nothing to go on. It's a scam.

37:58.103 --> 38:01.644
He has traveled a long way just a scam.

38:01.728 --> 38:05.769
I have a plan. Trust me.

38:09.269 --> 38:14.102
- Are you okay? You look tired. - I'll be fine.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.435
What about Bill?

38:34.519 --> 38:38.435
He comes up a little later. It's not a good day today.

38:40.643 --> 38:43.352
He is old.

38:54.310 --> 38:58.226
You ... I know you hate me.

38:58.310 --> 39:01.476
I know you feel betrayed by your father and me -

39:01.560 --> 39:04.685
- And I'm sorry it hurts you.

39:04.768 --> 39:07.643
Will this from Bill?

39:09.309 --> 39:12.768
Bill thinks I'll give you half. I assumed it would not be enough.

39:12.851 --> 39:16.226
- Am I right? - Give me an offer and see.

39:16.309 --> 39:21.059
We can not forget the past and talk like adults?

39:21.143 --> 39:25.309
I'm here because I think of the future, not the past.

39:27.726 --> 39:30.309
You have married you.

39:33.434 --> 39:36.851
- Do you love her? - Do you care?

39:39.475 --> 39:42.017
Is she pregnant?

39:43.809 --> 39:47.850
And this is how you are going to support them?

39:47.934 --> 39:51.267
Do not you think that he wanted to provide their grandchildren?

39:51.350 --> 39:54.392
I think he wanted you to get a job.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.392
Would not you make an offer?

39:59.475 --> 40:03.183
You should be grateful to Bill because he likes you.

40:03.433 --> 40:07.225
For some reason. I would not even look at you.

40:07.308 --> 40:10.808
You liked me too once.

40:10.891 --> 40:13.516
Until we started to fuck.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.600
Until we ended fuck.

40:31.266 --> 40:36.183
Stay a while and let us settle this like adults.

40:36.266 --> 40:41.182
I'm not going to give me. I came here to get what belongs to me.

40:41.266 --> 40:43.849
Not that you still want me?

40:45.599 --> 40:49.724
You are a married woman. Act like one of those.

40:49.807 --> 40:54.682
The faithful wife. Have children, manage a household.

40:54.766 --> 40:56.807
Is that what you want?

40:58.307 --> 41:01.807
Even a fantasy you fail to realize?

42:15.931 --> 42:18.389
David?

42:20.097 --> 42:22.305
I have a message for you.

42:29.472 --> 42:32.847
I know what's going on between you and Isabelle.

42:32.930 --> 42:35.180
She has not told me anything.

42:35.263 --> 42:39.430
You know that crap about once, twice, three times?

42:40.888 --> 42:44.472
If you do, she will like it as many times as you want.

43:50.012 --> 43:51.762
Hello Darling.

44:27.053 --> 44:30.719
She's a bitch, and do not deserve to keep a cent.

44:30.803 --> 44:34.969
I told you that everything will be fine when I'm back.

44:36.553 --> 44:38.469
I promised you.

44:57.469 --> 44:59.510
David! No!

44:59.594 --> 45:01.927
- It is my turn. - No! No!

45:02.719 --> 45:05.510
Stop!

45:15.968 --> 45:18.093
Hold on, honey ...

45:18.302 --> 45:20.302
No! No!

45:29.468 --> 45:31.593
Not now!

45:56.884 --> 46:00.217
What have you done? What have you done?

46:07.509 --> 46:10.676
It is okay.

46:10.759 --> 46:13.467
It's better than okay.

46:17.009 --> 46:21.259
Where are you going? What will you do?

46:32.342 --> 46:34.675
It's going to be alright.

47:18.966 --> 47:25.757
Isabelle ... Release me.

47:25.841 --> 47:29.757
- Let go of me, Isabelle. - It is not, then call the police.

47:29.841 --> 47:32.924
Of course I do! There's a dead man out there!

47:33.007 --> 47:36.299
He tried to rape me.

47:41.132 --> 47:45.674
What are you doing? Hell!

47:52.548 --> 47:56.673
You came to my rescue and killed him for me.

47:57.965 --> 48:02.298
- Your word against ours. - You set me up.

48:08.548 --> 48:12.798
It need not be like this. Think of our security.

48:18.798 --> 48:23.881
What do you want? What do you, Isabelle?

48:23.964 --> 48:26.714
What are you going to do?

48:28.423 --> 48:30.756
Isabelle?

48:30.839 --> 48:33.131
Can you tell us what you intend to do?

48:33.256 --> 48:36.297
There I let Bill explain.

48:52.839 --> 48:56.047
Would you like some water?

48:58.005 --> 49:03.672
Okay. Try to sleep now. I check to you in a moment.

49:20.838 --> 49:24.296
You can not run the whole way. You will crash.

49:24.380 --> 49:28.338
- I'll be fine. - Please, let me go.

49:28.421 --> 49:32.921
It is not, they do not trust you. It is I who must go.

49:33.005 --> 49:35.421
I go with. I can drive.

49:35.505 --> 49:39.838
I look better than you think.

49:39.921 --> 49:43.421
Believe me. You must stay here with him.

49:43.671 --> 49:46.504
You can plan.

49:47.213 --> 49:51.171
I do not want you to do this.

49:51.254 --> 49:54.713
I have no choice.

49:54.796 --> 49:57.712
You knew it would be like this.

50:02.837 --> 50:06.254
- For how long will you be gone? - I'll be back tomorrow.

50:06.337 --> 50:10.337
Loose him not. We can not trust him yet.

50:10.421 --> 50:12.504
I love you.

51:09.878 --> 51:12.586
You should have something ready for you.

51:12.669 --> 51:15.961
If you stand, you have a chance.

51:16.044 --> 51:19.211
No money, no passport.

51:19.461 --> 51:24.169
When you are stuck in a foreign country, and you do not speak Spanish.

51:26.877 --> 51:30.002
I say this because I do not want you to be tied.

51:30.085 --> 51:32.419
But I do not want you dash off.

51:33.669 --> 51:36.419
I need your help.

51:38.544 --> 51:41.002
I did not want it to be like this.

51:43.752 --> 51:49.252
It does not matter if you believe me, just you understand the situation.

51:49.335 --> 51:54.918
If you flee, we will find you, and then convicted of murder.

52:00.085 --> 52:02.710
I want the body out of the pool.

52:04.710 --> 52:07.085
Do you help me?

55:29.664 --> 55:36.289
Do not you think that your behavior can be hard to deal with sometimes?

55:36.372 --> 55:39.414
Are you saying that it was my fault that he tried to rape me?

55:39.497 --> 55:41.622
- No. - What do you mean then?

55:41.705 --> 55:45.538
Most people may not be able to relate to a woman like you.

55:45.622 --> 55:48.538
So I am a bad woman?

55:48.622 --> 55:52.080
It makes you dangerous. Dangerous.

55:56.622 --> 55:59.330
What will you do with me?

56:04.621 --> 56:08.080
Does money really that much to you?

56:08.163 --> 56:10.455
I barely got inherit anything.

56:10.538 --> 56:14.496
Do you think you deserved his money just by his son?

56:14.580 --> 56:18.538
Do not you care about how much pain you caused him?

56:20.079 --> 56:24.454
It does not matter that I loved him and he loved me?

56:24.704 --> 56:28.621
- He died happy. - He died in an intoxication of drugs.

56:28.871 --> 56:32.996
You were not there. He died happy.

56:38.871 --> 56:41.912
How much do you want, Lucas?

56:41.996 --> 56:47.579
- Wondering it seriously? - I wonder.

56:51.079 --> 56:55.704
I want everything he gave you.

56:55.954 --> 57:00.079
- It is a question of principle. - Are you principled?

57:00.162 --> 57:01.204
And.

57:01.287 --> 57:05.912
How it fits with you fucked me while I was married to your father?

57:05.995 --> 57:08.620
Does no sex for you?

57:08.703 --> 57:11.995
Most men think they can keep emotions out.

57:12.078 --> 57:15.120
The problem is that most men overestimate themselves.

57:15.203 --> 57:17.495
Or you fall in love themselves only.

57:20.620 --> 57:25.495
Is that what you think love is? It's just desire.

57:26.661 --> 57:30.703
Love is not about fucking, you idiot.

57:30.786 --> 57:34.703
- Fuck is not the same as love. - As said...

57:34.786 --> 57:37.161
... Your behavior might be a little hard to handle.

57:37.244 --> 57:41.453
Why I bear the responsibility for how men behave around me?

57:46.078 --> 57:49.119
Sure, I should have been a little better judgment.

57:53.369 --> 58:00.161
- I guess I'm just in shock. - It's okay with you.

58:00.244 --> 58:03.911
Okay. You need a way out of this.

58:03.994 --> 58:09.535
We can give you. Money ... a new identity ...

58:09.619 --> 58:12.202
Leave your old life behind you.

58:12.285 --> 58:16.452
Allow it to Lucas, who came here to take the blame for the murder, and let him disappear.

58:17.869 --> 58:21.035
If I refuse ...

58:21.327 --> 58:26.577
If I instead wait for the police and tell the truth ...

58:26.660 --> 58:29.660
- ... When is your word against mine. - Two to one.

58:29.743 --> 58:33.243
And Bill has very good reputation.

58:33.327 --> 58:37.618
In addition, it is you who has a motive. The police will come when we are ready.

58:37.701 --> 58:41.535
Everything is being sorted out. In this now.

58:41.618 --> 58:44.618
Is that Bill? He takes care of it?

58:44.701 --> 58:49.660
Think, Lucas. What have you got to lose?

01:00:49.865 --> 01:00:53.865
It's rude to go through other people's possessions.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:01:00.865
We are well beyond the usual social rules, right?

01:01:07.323 --> 01:01:09.740
Do not you get bored here?

01:01:11.115 --> 01:01:17.531
What do you do all day? Swimming, sunbathing and eating ...

01:01:19.073 --> 01:01:21.531
- He has in all cases a hobby. - It's not a hobby.

01:01:21.615 --> 01:01:24.990
What is it then? His great masterpiece?

01:01:26.281 --> 01:01:31.281
A little serious music after having ridden the commercial scale for so long?

01:01:31.364 --> 01:01:34.073
And your contribution to civilization ...?

01:01:34.156 --> 01:01:37.323
Sure, I'm a nobody.

01:01:37.406 --> 01:01:42.614
I'm no great artist, or known musicians ...

01:01:43.614 --> 01:01:47.156
I had no chance from the beginning, right?

01:01:47.239 --> 01:01:50.364
Have you been drinking all day?

01:01:52.822 --> 01:01:56.322
What else is there to do this than to drink ...

01:01:56.406 --> 01:01:59.656
... Bathe and fuck?

01:02:00.697 --> 01:02:05.405
It is literally the only thing you do here. And ruining people's lives!

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:11.072
Did he have a family? A father? A mother? Girlfriend?

01:02:11.197 --> 01:02:14.697
- You never think of the consequences. - But you do?

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.780
I? No...

01:02:16.864 --> 01:02:21.280
I'm just a spoiled little pigs had all served.

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.530
And then it was stolen from me again!

01:02:32.905 --> 01:02:37.196
You've already ruined my life once, and now you want to do it again!

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.030
I give you a new life! A new start!

01:02:41.113 --> 01:02:44.405
If I let you set me up for murder.

01:02:44.488 --> 01:02:47.696
I could kill you now ...

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:50.821
... And the world would be infinitely better.

01:02:53.279 --> 01:02:57.738
You would have said yes, while you had the chance.

01:03:00.071 --> 01:03:03.113
Get up.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.279
Come on.

01:03:06.862 --> 01:03:10.529
You need to think through your situation. You are smoked.

01:03:10.612 --> 01:03:14.362
There you have a way out, just as she offered you.

01:03:14.446 --> 01:03:19.404
- Why did you no? - I was waiting for the catch.

01:03:19.487 --> 01:03:21.571
Okay, we will not disappoint you.

01:03:21.654 --> 01:03:23.529
Tie him.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:30.779
You would have said yes. I have a plan here.

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:42.612
- We took the body out of the pool. - Damn!

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:46.528
The body must remain in the pool. It's part of the plan.

01:03:50.653 --> 01:03:53.903
Loose him. He'll put it back in the pool.

01:04:15.486 --> 01:04:21.278
Be careful. Do not harm him. Use your hands.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:28.152
It is time for you to dirty your hands.

01:04:30.444 --> 01:04:32.486
I must rinse him.

01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:43.277
Later tonight, the police here.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:48.569
Then they will find two bodies.

01:04:52.069 --> 01:04:56.277
The only question is -who two?

01:04:57.902 --> 01:05:00.610
Pick him.

01:05:28.693 --> 01:05:31.651
Keep him still.

01:05:32.984 --> 01:05:37.776
The problem with you, Lucas, is you're no good real killer.

01:05:37.859 --> 01:05:41.359
We saw this when you could not kill a rabbit.

01:05:41.443 --> 01:05:43.776
It was a disappointment.

01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:47.692
Now I had to motivate you.

01:05:53.526 --> 01:05:57.859
If you intend to kill me ... just do it.

01:05:57.942 --> 01:06:03.317
No, Lucas. You have not listened. You'll have to kill again.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:06.109
You see, I'm dying.

01:06:06.234 --> 01:06:11.275
I'm not going to fade away like an old man, and suffer in the end.

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:15.484
You have arrived at a very appropriate time.

01:06:15.567 --> 01:06:20.650
Given the situation you are in ...

01:06:20.733 --> 01:06:26.025
... You get permission to tighten up to you, if you want to be the one who survives.

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:31.650
Now put the body back in the pool.

01:06:41.608 --> 01:06:45.900
Can not we wait at least until tomorrow?

01:06:45.983 --> 01:06:50.941
It must be done tonight. It does not work if it goes too long.

01:06:51.024 --> 01:06:54.983
- I'm not ready. - But it is me.

01:07:11.607 --> 01:07:15.274
So ... here comes the offer.

01:07:15.357 --> 01:07:20.940
If you kill me, you get the passport, money ...

01:07:21.024 --> 01:07:23.357
... And you can start again.

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:28.774
A whole new life. With or without his wife and children.

01:07:29.982 --> 01:07:33.190
And if I refuse?

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.982
When I shoot you, you stupid bastard.

01:07:37.065 --> 01:07:41.440
Go get the gun. He must do it with the same weapon.

01:07:50.648 --> 01:07:55.981
- What do you suffer from? - Leukemia. Including.

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.690
Why do not you shoot yourself?

01:07:59.773 --> 01:08:03.940
It would ruin the insurance, right?

01:08:04.023 --> 01:08:08.939
With that, I leave to her she will be unimaginably rich.

01:08:09.023 --> 01:08:11.356
She need not worry.

01:08:11.439 --> 01:08:15.148
But I want to assure me that she is safe from you.

01:08:15.231 --> 01:08:18.856
You do not disturb her again.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:23.106
I can promise you ... but you're still dead then.

01:08:24.147 --> 01:08:27.897
I doubt that you would trust me.

01:08:30.856 --> 01:08:33.522
Damn it. It's true.

01:08:38.272 --> 01:08:43.522
My name is Lucas Carver, and this is my confession.

01:08:45.397 --> 01:08:49.564
I came here to take revenge on the bitch who stole my heritage.

01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:54.688
When I came here, she was having an affair with another man -

01:08:54.772 --> 01:09:01.272
- So I killed them both, and I would have killed her too ...

01:09:01.354 --> 01:09:04.354
Are you going to show the gun you hold to my head?

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:07.688
Works a confession at gunpoint?

01:09:08.688 --> 01:09:11.520
Yes, when I show them this.

01:09:11.604 --> 01:09:16.938
You came here with a new passport, ready to escape the new identity.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:21.520
- You came here prepared. - Is it enough?

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:28.020
That means your new identity is botched -

01:09:28.104 --> 01:09:32.354
- Isabelle ever choose to show this recording.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:36.563
You two are really sick.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:39.563
Is it we who are sick?

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:44.979
The lawyer where the letters I gave you had sufficed.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.729
Why were you also had to pull out a little stale sex tape?

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.687
It was pure evil.

01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:58.187
What, the letters you gave me?

01:09:58.312 --> 01:10:02.062
There was nothing wrong in the survey.

01:10:02.145 --> 01:10:05.729
Nothing in the will was invalid.

01:10:05.812 --> 01:10:10.187
Those letters you received was concocted.

01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:15.895
You probably thought it was pure luck that the letters suddenly appeared.

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:19.520
No. It was I who arranged it.

01:10:21.353 --> 01:10:25.687
It was just a scam, a way to get you to come here.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.561
But you had to add it here.

01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.061
In a way, I'm glad for that, because I have got to know you better.

01:10:41.145 --> 01:10:46.478
And I know that the money you receive will hang up heavy on his neck -

01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:48.936
- The rest of your life.

01:10:50.269 --> 01:10:53.894
I could not leave her with the knowledge -

01:10:53.978 --> 01:10:58.728
- That a vengeful madman is on the loose ...

01:10:58.811 --> 01:11:02.186
... Which is still obsessed with her.

01:11:03.811 --> 01:11:08.686
Lucas, what did you think would happen when you came here?

01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:13.561
Did you think she would leave me for you?

01:11:14.936 --> 01:11:18.102
It had been a perfect solution -

01:11:18.185 --> 01:11:21.769
- If you were a man she could love.

01:11:21.852 --> 01:11:25.144
But it is not, and never will be.

01:11:25.227 --> 01:11:29.269
Now you can not try to mess with her anymore.

01:11:29.352 --> 01:11:34.060
She is safe from you. So, have you decided?

01:11:34.143 --> 01:11:38.935
Are you going to kill me, take the money and disappear forever?

01:11:40.435 --> 01:11:42.810
Or do I have to kill you?

01:11:42.893 --> 01:11:47.810
There is not much to choose from, I know, but still ...

01:11:47.893 --> 01:11:50.851
Which do you choose?

01:11:51.851 --> 01:11:54.351
Give me the fucking gun.

01:11:54.435 --> 01:11:56.685
Bill!

01:11:56.935 --> 01:11:58.768
Not yet.

01:12:00.476 --> 01:12:02.893
Please, wait.

01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:35.600
Now its time.

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:40.725
I need more time.

01:12:45.017 --> 01:12:47.642
I love you.

01:12:48.309 --> 01:12:50.392
And I love you.

01:12:50.475 --> 01:12:53.517
You have made me a happy man.

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:04.183
You are a good soul.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:21.933
Everything aches. I can not stand anymore.

01:13:25.141 --> 01:13:27.349
I have to leave.

01:13:30.474 --> 01:13:33.558
Will you miss me?

01:14:03.724 --> 01:14:06.182
One should be enough.

01:14:14.557 --> 01:14:17.307
Detach one hand.

01:14:27.765 --> 01:14:31.765
Well, then the moment of truth is finally here.

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:39.515
It's time to kill me.

01:14:40.848 --> 01:14:45.848
Tell me, Lucas. Do you have what it takes?

01:14:45.931 --> 01:14:47.556
Do you have...

01:15:19.222 --> 01:15:23.472
How long do I have before you call the police?

01:15:27.139 --> 01:15:31.638
It was not included in Bill's plan.

01:15:35.388 --> 01:15:40.055
Fucking bitch, this is your plan.

01:15:40.138 --> 01:15:43.097
You deserve no better.

01:15:45.388 --> 01:15:48.471
Come closer, you tremble course.

01:17:51.094 --> 01:17:55.510
Yes. Police ...

01:17:55.594 --> 01:18:00.052
My husband has been murdered. Yes...

01:18:36.385 --> 01:18:39.093
Now it is done.
