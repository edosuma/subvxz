00:08.282 --> 00:10.552
It's a good show, Mr. Monk.
Very old-fashioned.

00:10.619 --> 00:11.758
No sex or anything.

00:11.922 --> 00:14.179
- I. I think you'd like it.
- No, thank you.

00:14.199 --> 00:16.519
- Why, because it's on channel 11?
- That's right.

00:16.539 --> 00:18.270
But you'd watch it if was on channel 10.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.176
That's right.

00:19.196 --> 00:22.031
Okay, well, let's just say that you're
flipping through the channels,

00:22.051 --> 00:24.012
and you see a show that you really like,

00:24.089 --> 00:26.653
and it just happens
to be on channel 23.

00:26.673 --> 00:30.134
Why would I be flipping channels?
If it's a good show, it's on channel 10.

00:30.217 --> 00:32.517
Well, yeah, I mean...
Okay...

00:33.215 --> 00:34.888
okay. Yeah, here they come.

00:34.989 --> 00:36.918
Yeah, i'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor.

00:37.376 --> 00:38.842
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.877
You just said, "thank you, Doctor."

00:40.934 --> 00:42.895
- No, I didn't.
- It was Dr. Kroger.

00:44.033 --> 00:47.060
The crime scene boys found something
inside that might upset you.

00:47.451 --> 00:48.580
That's why we called.

00:48.676 --> 00:50.717
We figured you might
want to talk to him,

00:50.737 --> 00:52.473
so he said he'd stay up
and wait for you.

00:52.493 --> 00:53.674
Did somebody die?

00:53.694 --> 00:55.679
- Somebody we know?
- It's not homicide.

00:55.717 --> 00:58.230
Nobody was hurt.
It's a straight-up Burglary.

01:00.135 --> 01:01.401
Monk, it's pretty intense.

01:01.421 --> 01:04.203
If you don't think you can handle it,
maybe you should just go home.

01:04.527 --> 01:05.723
I understand.

01:07.856 --> 01:10.217
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
No, come on, come on, come on.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.486
We have to see.

01:20.136 --> 01:22.402
We found this by the front door.

01:22.422 --> 01:24.076
It was, folded up.

01:24.096 --> 01:26.131
The guy who broke in
must have dropped it.

01:26.151 --> 01:29.942
"To force heaven,
mars shall have a new angel."

01:30.788 --> 01:32.255
Some kind of code.

01:32.561 --> 01:33.380
Is that it?

01:33.400 --> 01:35.168
That's just an appetizer.

01:35.188 --> 01:38.796
Apparently this guy had a grocery list.
He took a couple of cell phones,

01:39.042 --> 01:40.663
a flashlight bulb,

01:41.043 --> 01:43.614
some waterproof sealant,
and some braided copper wire.

01:43.775 --> 01:46.207
Okay...
he's making a bomb,

01:46.227 --> 01:48.108
- remote control.
- I'm not done.

01:49.219 --> 01:52.622
He also took ten 20-volt
magnesium batteries.

01:55.297 --> 01:58.133
20 years, I've only seen
one other bomb like that.

01:58.671 --> 01:59.559
Trudy?

02:01.083 --> 02:02.954
He used this to pry open the door.

02:06.104 --> 02:07.319
It's just a crowbar.

02:07.525 --> 02:08.836
Look at the fingerprints.

02:10.317 --> 02:13.868
Thumb, index finger,
middle finger, ring finger,

02:13.924 --> 02:14.735
Pinky.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.089
Six fingers?

03:58.081 --> 03:58.833
No!

03:59.387 --> 04:00.641
Wai, wait!

04:05.611 --> 04:07.577
No, trudy.
Trudy...

04:08.039 --> 04:09.751
No, wait! Wait!

04:09.809 --> 04:11.802
Trudy! No!

04:12.275 --> 04:13.124
No!

04:13.606 --> 04:14.475
No!

04:39.485 --> 04:42.852
"To force heaven,
mars shall have a new angel."

04:43.350 --> 04:44.103
Okay.

04:44.403 --> 04:46.294
Let's just review what we know.

04:46.463 --> 04:50.374
So the page was torn out of some kind of
appointment book.

04:50.756 --> 04:52.936
It's march 14th, which is today.

04:52.974 --> 04:54.847
11 p.m. Is circled. So,

04:55.377 --> 04:57.788
something is going to happen tonight
at 11 p.m.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.698
Now let's review what we don't know.

05:00.872 --> 05:02.068
Everything else!

05:02.241 --> 05:04.816
What's going to happen?
Where is it happening? Who is involved?

05:04.836 --> 05:08.147
I've been working on that. I bought
a book last night on code breaking.

05:09.650 --> 05:11.290
Good. You bought a book?!

05:13.123 --> 05:14.078
Case solved.

05:14.098 --> 05:15.884
It's called,
the simple substitution code.

05:15.922 --> 05:18.879
"A" equals one. "B" equals two.
When you add them all up, you get...

05:18.899 --> 05:20.352
<i>358. 358.</i>

05:20.391 --> 05:23.229
Which...
doesn't help us at all.

05:23.386 --> 05:24.409
Thank you.

05:26.068 --> 05:29.093
Okay... now let's just think.
Let's just think.

05:30.854 --> 05:31.643
Mars.

05:32.168 --> 05:33.227
The planet?

05:34.536 --> 05:35.885
No, the god of war.

05:37.533 --> 05:39.038
Maybe it's part of a poem.

05:39.142 --> 05:42.113
You know?
Like a really dreadful poem.

05:44.606 --> 05:47.075
Were you drinking from this?

05:47.608 --> 05:48.322
No.

05:48.397 --> 05:49.786
It's lighter

05:50.070 --> 05:51.851
than it was yesterday.

05:52.633 --> 05:54.541
About four ounces.

05:55.465 --> 05:57.857
Mr. Monk...
you okay?

05:58.465 --> 06:00.454
You still thinking about that dream?

06:04.328 --> 06:05.447
To see her...

06:07.194 --> 06:08.853
It must have been awful.

06:09.775 --> 06:11.029
Then I wake up...

06:12.971 --> 06:14.726
And she's gone again.

06:17.693 --> 06:19.449
After all these years...

06:20.253 --> 06:23.070
To be so
close.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.546
Natalie, I can feel it.
I can just feel it.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.541
It's right in front of me!

06:29.629 --> 06:33.253
"To force heaven,
mars shall have a new angel. To force

06:33.647 --> 06:34.728
heaven,

06:35.094 --> 06:37.313
mars shall have a new angel."

06:38.372 --> 06:39.933
Why can't I see it?

06:41.078 --> 06:42.216
Why can't...

06:44.304 --> 06:45.075
Wha...

06:53.838 --> 06:54.649
What?

07:04.679 --> 07:06.358
"To force

07:07.490 --> 07:08.532
heaven."

07:08.804 --> 07:11.270
You did it, didn't you?
Oh, my god, you figured it out!

07:11.290 --> 07:13.419
I gotta call the captain.
Everybody's gonna wanna help.

07:13.439 --> 07:14.998
No. No, no! No.

07:15.191 --> 07:16.496
False alarm.

07:16.794 --> 07:17.682
No.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.849
No, I thought I had...

07:20.492 --> 07:23.235
Something, but it's
just a false alarm.

07:23.863 --> 07:26.236
You'll get it.
You always do.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.383
But, Mr. Monk, it's almost 10:30.

07:29.403 --> 07:31.605
I have to go meet Julie.
She has that dance recital.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.570
You sure you don't wanna go?
Okay, well,

07:33.613 --> 07:36.962
i'm gonna bring my phone.
So call me if you need anything.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.576
"2...4...
7...

08:40.268 --> 08:41.600
"Mars-Hall

08:42.163 --> 08:43.706
Avenue.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.230
Angel."

09:29.237 --> 09:30.664
Right on time.

09:31.982 --> 09:33.120
Did you bring it?

09:35.848 --> 09:37.797
The money. Do you got it or not?

09:39.310 --> 09:40.944
Don't screw with me, man.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.326
I held up my end. I just got back
from Riverton. It's all set up.

09:44.384 --> 09:45.712
We're good to go.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.859
Hell.
Jesus, stay right there.

09:52.486 --> 09:53.876
Who the hell are you?

09:55.066 --> 09:56.339
You dropped this.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.382
At the store.

09:59.476 --> 10:01.309
What the hell are you talkin' about?

10:03.519 --> 10:05.351
I said stay back! I mean it!

10:09.765 --> 10:11.212
Wait a minute. I know you.

10:13.831 --> 10:16.728
You're the cop with the.
With the what? The wife.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.463
You gonna kill me?

10:56.959 --> 10:58.424
Like this? Like a dog?

10:59.685 --> 11:00.438
Why?

11:01.590 --> 11:02.514
Why?

11:02.605 --> 11:04.012
- <i>Why?</i>
- Why?!

11:04.219 --> 11:07.455
I don't know why.
I never know why.

11:08.348 --> 11:09.814
It was just a job.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.387
I didn't even know the lady.

11:11.407 --> 11:12.285
Who...

11:15.519 --> 11:16.754
Who hired you?

11:16.988 --> 11:18.802
I tell you that, i'm a dead man.

11:25.551 --> 11:27.152
You can't do it, can you?

11:28.591 --> 11:30.751
Yeah, it's not in you. I can tell.

12:08.850 --> 12:12.572
Sheriff's department! Drop that weapon.
I'm not askin' twice!

12:13.865 --> 12:15.254
That's a good boy.

12:15.350 --> 12:17.453
Now, with your foot,

12:17.655 --> 12:20.703
slide the gun away,
nice and easy.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.597
You're doin' good.

12:24.923 --> 12:26.312
Kiss the floor.

12:27.079 --> 12:27.812
See...

12:28.059 --> 12:30.848
That's something, if you knew me,
kissing the floor.

12:30.868 --> 12:33.936
You know, I'd really love to chat
ith you, pal. I would.

12:33.956 --> 12:37.124
Right now, I need you face down
on the floor.

12:39.874 --> 12:42.189
This is rollins, 247 marshall.

12:42.406 --> 12:44.007
Get everybody down here.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.540
I need crime scene unit
and a meat wagon.

12:46.621 --> 12:48.898
Suspect
is in custody.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.599
You have the right to remain silent.

12:51.904 --> 12:53.737
You have the right to an attorney.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.421
Anything you say

12:55.708 --> 12:58.921
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

13:00.135 --> 13:01.369
Turn to your right.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.175
Victim, Frank Nunn.

13:16.733 --> 13:18.199
Frank?
Nunn.

13:18.451 --> 13:19.955
We found his passport.

13:20.073 --> 13:23.299
Been in Brazil for the last eight years.
Just got back a week ago.

13:23.337 --> 13:25.157
Yeah, look, I didn't do it.

13:25.466 --> 13:28.668
- I, I didn't shoot him.
- You didn't shoot him?

13:29.186 --> 13:30.677
Buddy, I was there, remember?

13:30.697 --> 13:34.476
I was looking for the guy who hired him.
He was the only lead I had.

13:34.496 --> 13:35.663
I'd have to be crazy.

13:35.683 --> 13:36.674
Yeah, well,

13:36.921 --> 13:39.533
if "i' have to be crazy"
was a viable defense,

13:39.591 --> 13:42.580
we could rent our jails out
for birthday parties.

13:43.488 --> 13:46.034
Step over here
and let's get you fingerprinted.

13:52.448 --> 13:53.953
Index finger.

13:58.726 --> 14:01.423
Yeah...okay. Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:01.676 --> 14:04.107
Relax, Adrian, it's not gonna hurt.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.896
It's just a little
ink.

14:08.425 --> 14:12.054
Wait...yeah, okay, wait.
Wait, wait... I,

14:12.634 --> 14:15.045
I'll do it.
Let me do it.

14:16.279 --> 14:17.358
Let me do it.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.683
- I don't have time for this.
- I can do it, just.

14:41.703 --> 14:42.812
Little help.

14:45.935 --> 14:48.134
- Okay, buddy, let's go.
- Just...yeah...

14:48.180 --> 14:51.218
- <i>All right, here we go.</i>
- All together. Ready?

14:51.389 --> 14:53.471
I got it.
I got it.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.536
Good. Little more.

14:56.924 --> 14:59.199
It's happening.
It's all a matter of...

14:59.332 --> 15:00.113
Yep,

15:00.133 --> 15:01.894
- <i>Almost there.</i>
- Almost there.

15:02.029 --> 15:05.598
Here we go. I got it.
We got it, we got it. Got it.

15:09.084 --> 15:10.531
Wipe. Wipe.

15:10.801 --> 15:11.670
Wipe.

15:12.133 --> 15:12.982
Wipe.

15:14.951 --> 15:17.561
- Just take a couple of these.
- Not guilty, your Honor.

15:17.591 --> 15:21.566
The state moves for the prisoner
to be remanded until trial without bail.

15:21.616 --> 15:24.626
Your Honor, my client is not a flight
risk. He's a former Police Officer.

15:24.754 --> 15:27.610
He served the city of San Francisco
honorably for 14 years.

15:27.963 --> 15:31.002
He still has friends in the department,
some of whom are here today.

15:31.284 --> 15:33.831
I should also point out that,
even if he wanted to flee,

15:34.198 --> 15:35.722
my client doesn't drive.

15:35.807 --> 15:38.869
He also has an obsessive fear
of airplanes...

15:38.970 --> 15:40.012
And boats.

15:40.601 --> 15:41.680
And trucks.

15:41.972 --> 15:44.355
And trains.
He's not going anywhere.

15:44.414 --> 15:48.140
Your honor, on tuesday night,
mr. Monk somehow overcame his fears

15:48.268 --> 15:51.409
to board a bus and travel 95 miles
to angel county.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.794
His record of service is impressive.
But even more impressive

15:54.833 --> 15:56.823
is the mountain of evidence against him.

15:57.132 --> 15:59.736
Mr. Monk's motive is clear.

15:59.881 --> 16:02.424
He was obsessed with the victim
Frank Nunn.

16:02.640 --> 16:04.208
- That's not good.
- Furthermore,

16:04.266 --> 16:07.818
mr. Monk has admitted under oath
that he owned the gun.

16:07.930 --> 16:09.708
That he took the gun from his house.

16:09.785 --> 16:11.864
That he carried it to the crime scene.

16:11.941 --> 16:14.796
- And that it never left his possession.
- That's not good.

16:14.856 --> 16:18.648
And we will introduce ballistic evidence
which will prove that Mr. Monk's gun.

16:18.725 --> 16:23.109
The gun that came from this house,
the gun that never left his hand.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.440
Is the same weapon
that fired the fatal bullet.

16:26.498 --> 16:27.931
It's all circumstantial.

16:27.951 --> 16:29.946
The bullet definitely came from his gun.

16:30.002 --> 16:32.548
It's been tested by two
different laboratories.

16:34.140 --> 16:36.912
Bail is set at $900,000.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.380
With the court's permission,

16:48.603 --> 16:50.513
could you make it an even million?

16:51.887 --> 16:53.508
Oh, my god.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.941
What do you think?

16:57.961 --> 16:59.678
- What do you think?
- What do you think?

16:59.698 --> 17:01.304
Right now, i'm afraid to think.

17:01.361 --> 17:03.924
He can't go to prison.
He can barely survive out here.

17:03.985 --> 17:06.913
Okay, there's gonna be a trial.
I mean, if he gets a good lawyer, right?

17:06.933 --> 17:10.276
But all the evidence. You heard
the Judge. The bullet came from his gun.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.877
Monk said he didn't do it.

17:13.077 --> 17:15.589
That's funny. This is the kind of case
Monk always solves.

17:16.195 --> 17:19.189
You know, not funny, "ha ha" funny.
You know, more like...

17:19.357 --> 17:20.688
Not funny at all funny.

17:21.321 --> 17:22.132
Monk...

17:22.440 --> 17:23.489
It wasn't me.

17:23.509 --> 17:24.778
Cap, it wasn't me.

17:24.932 --> 17:26.608
Sheriff, excuse us.

17:26.784 --> 17:27.826
Thank you.

17:28.832 --> 17:30.819
I thought about it. I almost did it.

17:31.604 --> 17:33.186
But I didn't pull the trigger.

17:34.695 --> 17:35.949
You believe me, right?

17:37.123 --> 17:40.152
We'll worry about that later.
Right now, we gotta get you out of here.

17:40.355 --> 17:42.701
Now, your bail's
been set at a million, even.

17:43.068 --> 17:46.021
We need 10% of that.
Now, I can mortgage my town house.

17:46.101 --> 17:47.355
I could sell my car.

17:47.899 --> 17:49.481
I'm leasing, so...

17:50.300 --> 17:52.886
- Let's go. Van's downstairs.
- One second.

17:52.996 --> 17:54.289
Can I say good-bye?

17:57.657 --> 17:58.506
Don't...

17:59.422 --> 18:00.858
Don't worry about me.

18:01.699 --> 18:02.933
Okay? I mean...

18:04.085 --> 18:05.183
I'll be okay.

18:10.248 --> 18:11.145
All right.

18:11.165 --> 18:14.954
Let's not get all conjugal here.
We got a long ride ahead of us.

18:17.064 --> 18:18.106
Whew.

18:25.394 --> 18:26.899
Well, I guess we better go too.

18:30.898 --> 18:32.210
Where is my pass?

18:46.666 --> 18:47.785
Watch your head.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.066
Cold like that,
you should have stayed home.

19:08.086 --> 19:10.139
Can't, I used up all my sick days.

19:11.395 --> 19:14.404
You know how many sick days
I've used last ten years?

19:15.272 --> 19:16.102
Zero.

19:16.537 --> 19:19.184
Nada. Well,
- You're superman.

19:19.290 --> 19:21.354
I just take care of myself is all.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.952
Don't smoke,
on the treadmill every morning.

19:24.013 --> 19:27.852
Drink a quart of juice every day.
O.j., apple, pomegranate.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.738
I plan to live forever.

19:30.485 --> 19:32.376
It'll just seem like forever.

19:33.849 --> 19:34.910
What the...

19:36.506 --> 19:38.025
That's this?

19:56.321 --> 20:00.901
All units, we are on foot in pursuit.
Mile marker 42, heading west.

20:29.398 --> 20:31.501
I need a detailed map of the area.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.246
Make sure it's up to date.
Satellite photos if you got 'em.

20:34.353 --> 20:37.073
All right, listen up,
'cause I'm not repeating myself.

20:37.144 --> 20:41.148
Adrian Monk is a homicide suspect
with a history of mental illness.

20:41.187 --> 20:42.885
He's 5'10" tall.

20:42.961 --> 20:45.348
When last seen,
he was handcuffed and on foot.

20:45.489 --> 20:49.638
I want roadblocks at I-17
and Chester avenue.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.315
I want you to stop everything.

20:51.451 --> 20:55.068
I mean every truck, every car, every
tricycle that tries to get through.

20:55.107 --> 20:57.268
Understand?
Don't say anything, just nod.

20:57.333 --> 20:58.464
I need a helicopter.

20:58.492 --> 20:59.903
- Ten minutes.
- Make it five.

20:59.939 --> 21:01.853
- Where are my dogs?
- Dogs are on their way.

22:19.776 --> 22:21.320
Red. Don't need red.

22:21.555 --> 22:23.330
Orange, where's orange?

22:27.545 --> 22:28.545
Orange.

22:42.130 --> 22:42.844
Hey!

22:43.794 --> 22:45.048
What are you doin'?

23:02.300 --> 23:03.921
Here you go, boy. Right here.

23:04.287 --> 23:05.117
Come on.

23:05.407 --> 23:06.892
Come on, take a good sniff.

23:07.113 --> 23:09.158
- Come on, that's right.
- What's the problem?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.461
He's not getting a scent.
I can't figure it.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.536
These his?

23:13.227 --> 23:16.003
That's a first.
A human being with no smell at all?

23:17.276 --> 23:19.839
Maybe he boiled his clothes
in case he had to hoof it.

23:39.111 --> 23:40.693
Yeah, he's got it now.

23:54.222 --> 23:55.177
Every tree?

23:55.197 --> 23:57.920
Yes, sir, it's as if he stopped
and touched every single tree.

23:57.940 --> 24:00.206
- We lost him.
- All right, he may be hurt.

24:00.450 --> 24:02.726
Fax an I.D. To every local hospital.

24:03.112 --> 24:05.022
Jackson, call the Marshall's office.

24:05.406 --> 24:07.297
I want checkpoints here,

24:07.432 --> 24:10.326
here, and here.
15-mile radius.

24:11.477 --> 24:12.307
Captain.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.530
Lieutenant,
nice of you to join us.

24:14.891 --> 24:17.552
- What the hell happened?
- Monk jimmied the lock on the van.

24:17.572 --> 24:19.385
When we slowed for a yellow,
he jumped out.

24:19.405 --> 24:20.473
He jumped out?

24:20.999 --> 24:23.001
- Don't believe it.
- Well, either that or

24:23.021 --> 24:25.083
aliens came down and beamed your boy up.

24:25.149 --> 24:27.464
You don't need all these guns.
He's not gonna hurt anybody.

24:27.541 --> 24:30.000
Ms. Teeger, your boss
is a murder suspect.

24:30.038 --> 24:33.142
Right now, he's acting like
a very guilty murder suspect.

24:33.276 --> 24:35.487
You know him. You work with him.
Where would he go?

24:36.190 --> 24:38.665
It's not a difficult question.
Are you cops or not?

24:38.773 --> 24:42.207
Sheriff, he's been spotted.
About three miles west.

24:42.227 --> 24:44.780
Scared a couple campers.
He was going through their campsite.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.700
Good work.
You get a clean shot, bring him down.

25:45.347 --> 25:45.989
Hey!

25:46.400 --> 25:47.590
What are you doing?

26:06.724 --> 26:07.575
Hey!

26:08.784 --> 26:10.125
What are you do?

26:11.051 --> 26:12.336
Well a No!

26:22.261 --> 26:23.395
Stop!

26:26.740 --> 26:27.855
What are you doing?

26:37.748 --> 26:38.486
Hey!

26:48.702 --> 26:50.441
So he drove around in a circle?

26:51.314 --> 26:53.317
I keep the steering wheel locked.

26:53.418 --> 26:54.646
It's called the club.

26:54.782 --> 26:57.344
So he drove around in a circle,
got out, ran away.

26:57.521 --> 26:59.203
Well, more of an oval,

26:59.283 --> 27:00.473
really. Like a...

27:01.142 --> 27:02.578
Like an elliptical.

27:03.332 --> 27:04.674
Circle's fine.

27:04.794 --> 27:06.835
- Just say circle.
- Which way did he go?

27:07.832 --> 27:08.683
South.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.063
He's heading home.

27:42.144 --> 27:43.013
Mr. Monk?

27:43.975 --> 27:45.657
Mr. Monk, I know you're here!

27:47.377 --> 27:48.198
Natalie...

27:48.218 --> 27:50.948
Mr. Monk, thank god.
I've been so worried.

27:51.691 --> 27:52.691
Me too.

27:52.878 --> 27:54.795
I've been rather worried as well.

27:55.778 --> 27:57.970
God. Here, go sit on the couch.
I'll get you some water.

28:01.109 --> 28:02.545
Where did you get that coat?

28:02.823 --> 28:04.203
From a hobo.

28:04.640 --> 28:06.340
- I traded him.
- For what?

28:07.229 --> 28:08.287
I can't tell you.

28:08.539 --> 28:10.004
Don't make me tell you.

28:10.135 --> 28:10.834
Okay.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.098
I need to get these off.

28:19.025 --> 28:19.743
What?

28:19.800 --> 28:22.213
- Maybe I should call the captain.
- You can't. You can't

28:22.283 --> 28:23.507
call the captain.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.774
- He'd have to bring me in.
- No, not necessarily.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.192
Nat, it's his job, Natalie.
Look, I didn't shoot that man.

28:29.438 --> 28:32.746
- Somebody set me up.
- But the bullet, It came from your gun.

28:32.783 --> 28:35.616
I don't know how they did it
or who's behind it.

28:35.889 --> 28:39.468
But I think that note,
that coded message, was left for me.

28:39.827 --> 28:42.511
It was bait. They knew I'd decipher it.

28:42.719 --> 28:47.016
They staged the electronics store
break-in to lure me to angel.

28:47.480 --> 28:51.136
If I can get back there,
look around that sculpture garden,

28:51.300 --> 28:52.830
maybe I can figure it out.

28:54.775 --> 28:55.606
Please...

28:56.413 --> 28:57.358
Natalie...

28:59.034 --> 28:59.941
I'm sorry.

29:00.058 --> 29:02.081
Of course I believe you.
Of course I believe you.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.461
What can I do to help?

29:03.576 --> 29:04.577
I need a file.

29:04.792 --> 29:05.812
A file.

29:06.701 --> 29:07.438
Here.

29:09.341 --> 29:10.211
Here.

29:10.797 --> 29:12.743
A bigger file! Bigger file.

29:14.070 --> 29:15.638
I have some tools upstairs.

29:15.676 --> 29:17.928
And some non-hobo clothes.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.238
Right, I will get that.
You just stay put. Stay right there.

29:22.483 --> 29:23.314
Hello?

29:26.382 --> 29:27.667
Hello? Natalie?

29:29.273 --> 29:30.411
It's Randy.

29:31.973 --> 29:33.618
You know, your front door was open.

29:40.151 --> 29:41.707
Do you wanna take a bath?

29:44.819 --> 29:45.613
Bath?

29:47.633 --> 29:48.633
No, thanks.

29:52.387 --> 29:53.896
You greet all your guests that way?

29:53.916 --> 29:55.732
I'm surprised you're
not a lot more popular.

29:55.902 --> 29:57.430
No so guests this,

29:57.688 --> 29:59.351
Rollins
figures Monk

29:59.433 --> 30:00.775
is heading back here.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.830
He thinks he's gonna try
and get in contact with you.

30:04.087 --> 30:04.749
So,

30:04.881 --> 30:06.828
I'm supposed to be staking
out the place.

30:09.497 --> 30:11.217
You haven't heard from him, have you?

30:11.477 --> 30:12.133
No.

30:13.089 --> 30:15.086
Yeah, I didn't think so.

30:15.147 --> 30:19.124
You know, I tried to tell Rollins
Monk is too smart to come back here.

30:19.181 --> 30:20.701
But nobody listens to me.

30:20.815 --> 30:22.024
Hey, what's this?

30:23.648 --> 30:25.613
Mitch's old uniform.

30:25.846 --> 30:26.595
I was

30:26.751 --> 30:28.565
giving it to the salvation army.

30:29.214 --> 30:30.999
I figure it's time to move on.

30:31.055 --> 30:32.398
Well, good for you.

30:32.587 --> 30:34.798
I've been saying that for three years,
but...

30:36.301 --> 30:37.510
What's with the drill?

30:41.101 --> 30:43.848
My blender broke, and I was
going to make a smoothie.

30:44.852 --> 30:45.909
With a power drill?

30:46.121 --> 30:46.934
Yeah.

30:48.683 --> 30:50.133
Well, don't let me stop you.

30:53.905 --> 30:54.831
You want one?

30:55.081 --> 30:58.668
No, I actually had a protein shake
at home depot on my way over.

31:00.922 --> 31:03.235
Hey, would you
hand me a glass out of that cupboard?

31:14.014 --> 31:15.884
Yeah. Really good.

31:16.457 --> 31:19.008
Really good.
I'm kind of an expert at this.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.567
Could you hand me some of those nuts
right there in the orange...

31:32.361 --> 31:33.816
Orange little thing right there.

31:37.864 --> 31:39.433
Here, just dump it right in there.

31:45.622 --> 31:47.833
Nuts, protein.

31:49.523 --> 31:51.601
A little juice. Coffee.

31:59.324 --> 32:01.233
Will you give me that honey, please?

32:05.099 --> 32:06.723
Can you. Sorry.

32:10.179 --> 32:11.936
- There you go.
- Awesome.

33:08.274 --> 33:10.164
Yeah, that's just what I needed.

33:14.188 --> 33:15.076
Is that oil?

33:16.299 --> 33:17.799
That is oil. It's,

33:18.325 --> 33:21.215
it's from the ground, so it's organic.
And it just...

33:21.252 --> 33:23.726
Lubricates your organs.
So it's, it's good.

33:25.646 --> 33:28.551
I just.  Just need to wash up.
I'll be right back.

33:29.082 --> 33:30.215
You can have it.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.928
- There.
- Quiet. He's still in the kitchen.

33:59.475 --> 34:03.843
- Mitch's uniform. It's all that I had.
- No. I can't wear that.

34:04.098 --> 34:05.081
Mr. Monk.

34:05.469 --> 34:08.009
- He'd want you to.
- No, I mean it's all dusty.

34:08.117 --> 34:10.866
You were wearing a hobo's trench coat.
Okay.

34:12.868 --> 34:14.324
Here...
money.

34:15.484 --> 34:17.695
- Is this all you have?
- It's a week's paycheck.

34:17.737 --> 34:19.734
I was supposed to get
a 5% bump last january.

34:19.754 --> 34:21.690
Okay, okay. We'll talk about that later.

34:22.940 --> 34:23.889
Take these.

34:24.172 --> 34:25.089
Kleenex?

34:25.257 --> 34:27.429
They're antiviral.
It's a sick world out there.

34:28.257 --> 34:29.089
Natalie...

34:30.101 --> 34:31.065
Thank you.

34:32.063 --> 34:33.556
Know how you can thank me?

34:33.621 --> 34:35.059
Figure out what happened.

34:35.694 --> 34:36.696
Come home.

34:39.793 --> 34:41.996
If he made it across the river,
he could be here.

34:42.577 --> 34:43.617
What is this?

34:43.783 --> 34:45.054
That's a dairy farm.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.123
I don't think so.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.036
Where are you, buddy?

34:50.333 --> 34:53.661
Captain, call the phone company.
We're gonna need a wiretap.

34:53.735 --> 34:54.585
On who?

34:54.635 --> 34:56.772
Dr. Charles Kroger, downtown.

34:56.905 --> 34:58.283
Monk's shrink. Yeah, I know.

34:58.321 --> 35:01.194
He sees him four times a week.
If you believe that.

35:01.583 --> 35:03.321
Guy's a one-man psych ward.

35:05.274 --> 35:06.295
You got a problem?

35:06.899 --> 35:09.077
Well, tapping his shrink's phone.

35:09.112 --> 35:11.361
You're never gonna get a Judge to this,
Already done.

35:14.642 --> 35:17.943
- "Office of the Lieutenant Governor."
- Yeah, he's an old friend.

35:18.352 --> 35:21.509
We used to sneak cigarettes
behind the high school together.

35:34.862 --> 35:36.444
Excuse me. Can I help you?

35:36.784 --> 35:37.767
Captain Teeger.

35:38.134 --> 35:40.236
Yeah, I'm.
I'm just looking.

35:40.293 --> 35:42.762
Storeroom's around back.
This is just the warehouse.

35:42.972 --> 35:44.672
My boy's a Navy pilot too.

35:45.562 --> 35:46.856
Good, good. Really?

35:46.876 --> 35:49.870
He's down in Charleston
with the 725th tactical missile squad.

35:49.927 --> 35:52.186
Good for him.
That, that's a good choice.

35:52.242 --> 35:54.463
It really wasn't his choice.
What unit you with?

35:55.455 --> 35:56.438
All of 'em.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.316
They move me around a lot.
'cause,

36:00.181 --> 36:01.297
I'm a hero.

36:01.584 --> 36:03.171
All the kids,

36:03.274 --> 36:05.693
the recruits,
they wanna meet me, photo op...

36:05.983 --> 36:08.005
Normally, we don't let people
poke around back here.

36:08.025 --> 36:09.896
Especially now we had
a break-in last week.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.450
- Really?
- A guy got shot.

36:11.688 --> 36:13.181
- No kidding.
- Right over there.

36:13.219 --> 36:15.000
It was like the o.k. Corral.

36:15.328 --> 36:17.438
Why don't you look around.
You see anything you like,

36:17.476 --> 36:19.060
talk to me. I'll take care of you.

36:19.324 --> 36:20.855
Aim high, fly high. Am I right?

36:21.252 --> 36:22.971
Ab, absolutely.

36:23.187 --> 36:24.239
Aiming...

36:24.459 --> 36:26.595
and flying.
That's what we do.

36:27.045 --> 36:29.199
Maybe, maybe I will just
take a look around then.

37:00.339 --> 37:01.166
Okay...

37:12.478 --> 37:13.650
You be him.

37:14.462 --> 37:15.426
And...

37:39.090 --> 37:40.205
You be me.

37:41.961 --> 37:42.812
Sorry.

37:49.753 --> 37:50.565
Bang.

38:28.924 --> 38:29.793
Bang.

38:50.855 --> 38:53.429
- Anything on those credit cards?
- No, sir.

38:53.839 --> 38:55.955
Make sure the hotel rooms are covered.

38:56.012 --> 38:58.194
Double-team the bus stations
and the airport.

38:58.214 --> 39:01.020
But he's not going to the airport.
Monk's afraid to fly.

39:01.227 --> 39:04.061
Well, maybe he figures
we assume he won't fly,

39:04.118 --> 39:05.555
so he heads to the airport.

39:05.809 --> 39:08.081
Yeah, or maybe he knows we assume

39:08.222 --> 39:09.356
that he thinks he.

39:09.979 --> 39:11.812
He thinks he knows what, he's.

39:12.028 --> 39:13.218
He knows that we're.

39:13.483 --> 39:14.484
No, wait...

39:14.738 --> 39:15.871
I'll write it down.

39:17.976 --> 39:19.185
Natalie Teeger.

39:19.431 --> 39:21.491
- We're intercepting her mail.
- On whose authority?

39:36.385 --> 39:37.443
Stottlemeyer.

39:37.626 --> 39:38.731
<i>Leland, it's me.</i>

39:38.796 --> 39:41.816
- Monk, thank god. Are you okay?
- Leland, I know who set me up.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.320
- It was that Sheriff.
- Rollins? Why?

39:44.367 --> 39:45.775
<i>I don't know why.</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:48.078
<i>I can't figure that out.
But I know how.</i>

39:48.134 --> 39:51.070
Okay, okay, how? How is good.
<i>Let's start with how.</i>

39:51.135 --> 39:52.023
Okay...

39:52.571 --> 39:55.802
i had some orange juice
in my refrigerator.

39:56.350 --> 39:57.106
Okay.

39:57.264 --> 39:59.456
<i>Somebody drank</i> from it.
I thought it was Natalie.

39:59.721 --> 40:01.516
Monk, we haven't got a lot of time here.

40:01.536 --> 40:04.505
I'm talking about Rollins.
It was him.

40:04.599 --> 40:07.523
<i>He's always drinking juice.
I heard him talking about it.</i>

40:07.996 --> 40:09.963
<i>Leland...</i>
Here's what happened.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.929
<i>He broke into my house
the day before the shooting.</i>

40:12.986 --> 40:15.398
<i>And raided your refrigerator?</i>
<i>That's right.</i>

40:15.428 --> 40:18.270
<i>Then he drank some orange juice.
About four ounces.</i>

40:19.297 --> 40:20.997
<i>Then he found my handgun.</i>

40:21.236 --> 40:22.511
<i>He switched guns?</i>

40:22.531 --> 40:25.292
<i>Not the whole gun, just the barrel.</i>

40:25.369 --> 40:26.875
<i>My gun's a lane & westing.</i>

40:26.902 --> 40:28.387
<i>The barrels are interchangeable.</i>

40:28.473 --> 40:31.025
<i>Right, he used
the six-fingered man's prints</i>

40:31.063 --> 40:33.494
<i>and the note to lure me
to the sculpture garden.</i>

40:33.804 --> 40:36.582
<i>He was hiding there,
about 50 feet behind me.</i>

40:36.904 --> 40:38.922
<i>He waited for me to pull my gun,</i>

40:39.295 --> 40:40.618
<i>and then he took the shot.</i>

40:46.850 --> 40:49.088
<i>I need you face down on that floor.</i>

40:49.108 --> 40:51.352
<i>He told me to lie on the ground
face down.</i>

40:51.389 --> 40:53.066
<i>That's probably when he did it.</i>

40:53.278 --> 40:55.961
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

40:56.971 --> 40:59.296
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

41:00.283 --> 41:04.441
<i>Anything you say can
and will be used against you</i>

41:04.622 --> 41:06.228
<i>in a court of law.</i>

41:06.538 --> 41:07.729
<i>He switched them back.</i>

41:08.173 --> 41:10.682
So when the lab said
the bullet came from your gun...

41:10.776 --> 41:13.678
They were right. It was my gun.
Ateast... part of it.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.836
Okay, can you prove it?
Do you have anything else?

41:15.874 --> 41:17.935
<i>Okay.</i>
Leland, are you sitting down?

41:19.284 --> 41:22.213
I have a plastic tab
from a juice container.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.136
D- do you have any fingerprints?

41:25.761 --> 41:27.878
Fingerprints?
No.

41:27.988 --> 41:28.781
<i>No.</i>

41:29.935 --> 41:32.683
- That's not enough, is it?
- No, it's not enough!

41:40.985 --> 41:41.892
You okay?

41:42.916 --> 41:43.842
Who was that?

41:44.236 --> 41:45.616
That was Adrian Monk.

41:46.874 --> 41:47.876
You're kidding.

41:48.473 --> 41:49.191
Nope.

41:49.267 --> 41:51.313
I'm gonna meet him tonight.
I just set it up.

41:51.338 --> 41:52.906
He wants me to bring him some food.

41:53.144 --> 41:54.429
Good work, Captain.

41:54.506 --> 41:55.610
Call the Tac Squad.

41:55.630 --> 41:57.215
He said I should come alone.

41:57.255 --> 41:59.409
Yeah, I'm sure he did.

42:05.431 --> 42:06.451
Can I come?

42:08.956 --> 42:10.108
Yeah, sure.

42:31.099 --> 42:32.006
Leland?

42:33.918 --> 42:35.127
Hey, buddy!

42:37.842 --> 42:39.940
I brought you some chicken pot pies.

42:52.127 --> 42:53.242
Did you hear that?

42:53.654 --> 42:55.204
Relax, we're okay.

42:56.286 --> 42:58.724
I told you to come alone.

43:00.653 --> 43:03.459
Are you setting me up, Leland?
Monk, I swear.

43:05.527 --> 43:08.116
I told you,
I can't go to prison. I,

43:08.428 --> 43:10.706
I can't go!
You know I wouldn't survive it.

43:10.726 --> 43:12.017
Just put the gun away.

43:13.292 --> 43:14.010
Monk!

43:15.057 --> 43:16.833
Monk!
Monk!

43:18.303 --> 43:20.061
Monk, please drop the gun!

43:21.305 --> 43:27.219
