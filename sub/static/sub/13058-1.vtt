Well, more often than not,
when someone runs away,

20:16.282 --> 20:17.615
they end up going home.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.684
I can't just stop
by his apartment, Mom.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.118
Isn't that,
like, stalking?

20:21.120 --> 20:23.487
Well, you could slip a note
under his door.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.556
That's a little bit better
than texting.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.158
-A note saying what?
-I don't know.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.193
Honey, you will
think of something.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.995
Sorry. Got to go.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.296
Bye.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.433
Provenza: Well, this is
a little hard to explain.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.068
Of the three homeless men

20:37.070 --> 20:40.238
that Amanda was apparently
letting stay here,

20:40.240 --> 20:42.907
one ran from us,
got hit by a car,

20:42.909 --> 20:45.643
and he's in the hospital
with Sykes.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.378
One's too high to help.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.913
And the last one over here

20:48.915 --> 20:51.782
is having something
of a nervous breakdown.

20:51.784 --> 20:56.554
But he swears Amanda
gave him access to this house?

20:56.556 --> 20:57.855
Uh, yes, ma'am.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.357
And he's got a key,
but also an alibi,

20:59.359 --> 21:01.359
as did the guy
who was running away.

21:01.361 --> 21:04.295
All the people living here
were working night shifts

21:04.297 --> 21:07.198
at jobs arranged for them
through Care First, ma'am.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.467
I have Oderno
asking Ms. Wolf, you know,

21:09.469 --> 21:12.536
all background information
she can provide on them.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.305
And what about
Amanda's parents?

21:14.307 --> 21:16.507
What do you want to do
about them?

21:16.509 --> 21:17.775
At the moment, nothing.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.810
This is the entrance
to the basement.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.313
Maybe it was used
as a speakeasy back in the '20s,

21:22.315 --> 21:24.882
but for some reason,
they tried to cover it up.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.718
Kendall, anything else down
there other than her body?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.320
An I.D.? A weapon?

21:29.322 --> 21:32.189
No, just some old toys that have
been down there for a long time.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.692
On the body, no signs
of a struggle and no drag marks.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.360
She wasn't killed here.

21:36.362 --> 21:38.462
She wasn't shoved under the
house from the outside, either.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.965
Well, this trapdoor
has to be the access point,

21:40.967 --> 21:42.199
but it was covered up.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.135
So whoever put
Amanda's body down there

21:44.137 --> 21:46.637
knew about this space
and knew that it was safe

21:46.639 --> 21:48.339
to enter this house
at night.

21:48.341 --> 21:49.440
Time of death?

21:49.442 --> 21:52.009
Rigor's gone,
complete lividity, minor decomp,

21:52.011 --> 21:55.546
so anywhere from late Friday
night or early Saturday morning.

21:55.548 --> 22:00.284
Petechiae and massive bruising,
but no ligature marks.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.219
There's only a tiny
trickle of blood

22:02.221 --> 22:05.589

but otherwise...

22:05.591 --> 22:06.757
Oh, wait.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.827
What's that?

22:09.829 --> 22:12.730
Dr. Morales: Someone performed
a tracheotomy.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.666
Only semi-successful.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.435
Obviously.

22:17.437 --> 22:18.703
She was strangled,

22:18.705 --> 22:20.104
and then the killer
tried to revive her?

22:20.106 --> 22:22.306
Technically strangled.
Her windpipe was crushed.

22:22.308 --> 22:25.876
From the bruising, I'd say
smashed in with bare hands.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.378
-Signs of sexual assault?
-No.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.980
But her ribs are cracked
like someone gave her CPR.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.483
So, what? The killer had
a case of, uh, instant regret?

22:32.485 --> 22:35.119
Or some stranger came along
and tried to revive her.

22:35.121 --> 22:36.787
And then took her body
to a house

22:36.789 --> 22:38.089
belonging to her parents

22:38.091 --> 22:40.591
and then dumped Amanda
in a secret room

22:40.593 --> 22:42.360

the hidden trapdoor?

the girl needed
an alternate path to breathe

22:51.070 --> 22:52.403
and tried to create it.

22:52.405 --> 22:55.773
Doctor, if there's
a tracheotomy and CPR,

22:55.775 --> 22:58.642
did someone also
do mouth-to-mouth?

22:58.644 --> 23:01.779
Ah.
Well, they may have.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.616
Oh, wow.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.817
What?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.386
Her mouth
has been swabbed.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.287
Okay. We're looking
for someone

23:10.289 --> 23:12.790
who could perform
an emergency tracheotomy

23:12.792 --> 23:14.859
and also knows
how we test for DNA.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.427
Her mother is a doctor.

Detective Sanchez, it is time
to do our notification.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.798
And please tell the Ponds

23:20.800 --> 23:23.033

again tomorrow.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.503

don't need to be suspects.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.439
Doesn't everything
we've already learned tell us

23:28.441 --> 23:31.342
that lover-boy Gabe
fought with his girlfriend,

23:31.344 --> 23:34.178
Amanda, and then smashed her
in the windpipe,

23:34.180 --> 23:36.714
dumped her body
at her childhood home,

23:36.716 --> 23:38.015
you know, just to give

23:38.017 --> 23:40.217
a good what-for
to her mom and dad.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.453
But does he know
how to perform a tracheotomy?

23:42.455 --> 23:44.121
All right, well,
none of the guys

23:44.123 --> 23:45.456
Amanda was helping
is a vet,

23:45.458 --> 23:47.391
so no obvious
emergency medical training.

23:47.393 --> 23:50.928
And our runner was only wanted
for passing a worthless check.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.964
$90. Guess he took that more
seriously than we did.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.367
So, we're back to the mom.
She's a doctor.

23:56.369 --> 23:59.703
She and the husband forgot to
tell us about their other house.

23:59.705 --> 24:02.973
And they were pushing
the boyfriend at us really hard.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.743
Mike? Anything?

24:05.745 --> 24:07.011

Passed through Care First

24:32.905 --> 24:35.539

24:35.541 --> 24:39.243
Before that, Mr. Yum was
a county lifeguard for 12 years,

24:39.245 --> 24:42.179
so he would have
emergency medical training.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.382
Plus, a bonus arrest
for sexual battery of a minor

24:45.384 --> 24:47.751

his foster child.

24:47.753 --> 24:49.753

May I suggest, Captain,
