00:07.427 --> 00:09.320
Where's my drink?

00:13.455 --> 00:15.606
You sure you want to go down this road?

00:15.609 --> 00:18.625
I've waited a long time to find
the men who killed my family.

00:18.627 --> 00:20.694
I'm not walking away now.

00:22.898 --> 00:26.039
- And then what?
- And then I'll get answers.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.129
And I'll make things right.

00:30.132 --> 00:34.390
Talon, nothing can ever make that right.

00:43.385 --> 00:45.719
You the skin artist who made this mark?

00:45.721 --> 00:49.356
Aye. That's my fine artistry.

00:49.358 --> 00:53.560
- Want one like it?
- No.

00:53.562 --> 00:55.996
But I am looking for
the man who does have it.

00:55.998 --> 00:58.031
Are you now?

00:58.034 --> 01:02.068
Well, I don't give out names
to just any tart who asks.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.773
What's it gonna take
to change your mind?

01:08.110 --> 01:10.140
Oh, I can think of a few things.

01:10.143 --> 01:12.570
And absolutely none of those
things are going to happen.

01:12.573 --> 01:16.116
Well, guess you're not getting
that information then, are you?

01:16.118 --> 01:19.419
Gambling is forbidden by
command of the Prime Order.

01:38.874 --> 01:40.207
Get up. We have to go.

01:40.209 --> 01:41.541
I'll never make it.

01:41.543 --> 01:44.010
I've got this gammy leg.

01:44.012 --> 01:45.946
Talon, come on.

01:45.948 --> 01:47.314
Come on!

01:53.963 --> 01:55.296
This way.

01:55.299 --> 01:56.498
Get down!

01:58.660 --> 01:59.960
Run!

02:24.853 --> 02:27.020
- Give me the name.
- Look out!

02:30.192 --> 02:33.460
- The name!
- You get me out of here,

02:33.462 --> 02:35.462
I'll tell you whatever you want.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.848
Come on, come on! This way!

02:57.185 --> 02:59.054
Come on. There's more coming.

02:59.057 --> 03:01.041
Get Gunter.

03:01.044 --> 03:02.554
Get up!

03:25.830 --> 03:27.997
- I didn't do nothing.
- Get in there!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.549
Please let us go.

03:30.992 --> 03:33.927
- Now give me his name.
- Let me go!

03:33.930 --> 03:36.997
- What are you?
- We had a deal. His name.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.008
I said shut it!

03:38.009 --> 03:40.527
That's more than 20
years back I did that job,

03:40.529 --> 03:44.097
even before the Prime
Order overthrew the Royals.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.433
The Bones, they was called.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.302
Mercenaries. Mean bunch.

03:49.304 --> 03:51.871
Had me put that mark on
all seven of their arms.

03:51.873 --> 03:54.841
Seven? I need names.

03:54.843 --> 03:57.510
Lucky for you I seen one of them recent.

03:57.512 --> 03:58.978
Toru Magmoor.

03:58.980 --> 04:01.815
Toru Magmoor? Where did you see him?

04:01.817 --> 04:05.379
He's Covenant brass now. Rode out
of camp headed for the Outpost.

04:05.382 --> 04:07.787
- Gallwood Outpost?
- Aye.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.924
- I need more names.
- Tiberion Shek.

04:10.926 --> 04:12.625
He was the leader.

04:15.697 --> 04:17.593
- He's dead.
- Let's go.

04:29.177 --> 04:30.377
Where are we going?

04:30.379 --> 04:32.679
I'm going to Gallwood Outpost.

04:32.681 --> 04:35.248
That's halfway across the realm.

04:35.250 --> 04:36.883
We've got a good thing going here.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.952
- Hustling cards?
- No.

04:38.954 --> 04:40.578
You and me.

04:42.387 --> 04:44.587
This way. Over here.

04:46.728 --> 04:50.029
Are you mad? The other
side is greyskin territory.

04:50.031 --> 04:53.203
I know. They'd be mad to follow us.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.145
- Come on!
- No, it's greyskin territory.

05:10.148 --> 05:12.118
They won't get far.

05:23.098 --> 05:27.718
Greyskins. I was hoping they
weren't going to be this far east.

05:36.611 --> 05:38.734
Talon, stay back!

05:38.737 --> 05:41.046
No!

05:53.295 --> 05:56.229
Just get me some colipsum.

06:05.484 --> 06:08.107
Why did you do that?

06:10.612 --> 06:14.948
That's... That's how I want to go.

06:14.950 --> 06:17.383
I'm feeling fine...

06:17.385 --> 06:19.219
looking at you.

06:20.869 --> 06:22.903
No, no, no.

08:04.406 --> 08:05.984
_

08:09.230 --> 08:10.730
Get out of here, skags!

08:10.732 --> 08:12.865
This is our land, you filthy Blackblood.

08:15.503 --> 08:17.695
Oh, you're going to get it now, skag.

08:20.943 --> 08:22.367
_

08:30.652 --> 08:32.619
<i>Naba, Talon!</i>

08:32.621 --> 08:34.253
<i>Talon, naba!</i>

08:34.255 --> 08:35.822
Stop!

08:39.828 --> 08:41.828
Go on, clear off.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.094
Ow.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.896
_

08:59.899 --> 09:01.566
They killed a Remmick.

09:01.569 --> 09:02.997
Talon...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.568
_

09:05.571 --> 09:08.977
_

09:09.941 --> 09:12.141
Why do they hate us?

09:13.728 --> 09:15.995
They don't hate us.

09:15.997 --> 09:18.097
At least, not all of them.

09:21.618 --> 09:24.477
_

09:52.367 --> 09:55.401
No one left alive.

09:55.403 --> 09:58.571
If even one Blackblood escapes,

09:58.573 --> 10:00.485
this is all for nothing.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.756
Eremus, Eremus!

10:49.758 --> 10:50.923
Come on.

11:16.235 --> 11:18.243
Eremus!

11:46.555 --> 11:47.368
_

11:47.371 --> 11:48.791
_

11:49.047 --> 11:50.102
_

12:13.743 --> 12:15.708
This is all my fault.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.848
It's not your fault, Talon.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.516
_

13:02.757 --> 13:05.057
She's mine.

13:49.352 --> 13:50.766
She's dead.

16:13.391 --> 16:15.408
Look at her ears.

16:18.863 --> 16:21.397
Poor thing. Where's your family?

16:25.531 --> 16:27.998
Come along. We can't have
young girls wandering the roads.

16:28.001 --> 16:29.947
We're just two farms over.

16:31.709 --> 16:34.310
You come along. There's
bread and cheese.

16:34.312 --> 16:36.145
As much as you can eat.

17:14.752 --> 17:16.814
Everyone wash up for supper.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.292
I will not send her away. She's a child.

17:24.295 --> 17:27.829
We have children of our
own. It's too dangerous.

17:27.832 --> 17:31.100
Someone wanted them
all dead for a reason.

17:31.102 --> 17:33.069
People will talk.

17:33.071 --> 17:35.509
Well, just look at her ears.

18:58.590 --> 19:00.122
Stay where you are.

19:03.795 --> 19:04.994
Are you sick?

19:39.281 --> 19:41.648
Ugh! Why won't you die?

19:43.314 --> 19:46.569
Aah!

20:03.087 --> 20:05.658
You have to get them in
the mouth to kill them.

20:08.526 --> 20:10.893
I had it under control.

20:11.962 --> 20:14.764
- Of course you did.
- I did.

20:14.766 --> 20:17.291
All right. All right.

20:17.294 --> 20:19.961
But what kind of a soldier
would I be if I didn't assist?

20:19.964 --> 20:21.397
The usual kind.

20:27.492 --> 20:29.225
What are those things?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.480
Those are Plaguelings.

20:31.482 --> 20:34.917
We can talk later. Right now
it's time to get behind walls.

20:36.053 --> 20:39.621
Hey, we're not leaving you.

20:39.624 --> 20:42.825
So either you ride with us
or we all stay here and die.

20:47.715 --> 20:49.705
Now it's your choice.

21:06.647 --> 21:08.999
- The gates!
- The gates are closed after nightfall.

21:09.002 --> 21:11.762
They won't let us in if Plaguelings
are too close on our tail.

21:13.366 --> 21:15.699
Open the gate!

21:17.536 --> 21:20.304
The Gate Marshal doesn't like
it when you bring home a stray.

21:20.306 --> 21:22.873
So where are you from
and what's your business?

21:22.875 --> 21:25.643
Hey, you'll need a good story.

21:25.645 --> 21:27.945
I'll answer to the Gate
Marshal, not a common soldier.

21:27.947 --> 21:30.547
Well, let's hope you get the chance.

21:30.549 --> 21:33.550
- Open the gate!
- Too close, Captain!

21:33.552 --> 21:36.538
- Captain?
- Still a common soldier,

21:36.541 --> 21:38.155
who happens to be a captain.

21:38.157 --> 21:39.690
No need to apologize.

21:39.692 --> 21:41.058
I wasn't planning on it.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.058
Gods, I hate these things!

22:03.061 --> 22:04.811
That's the last of them. Open up!

22:04.814 --> 22:07.217
No, sir. There are more coming.

22:07.219 --> 22:10.694
Sergeant, open the
gate! That's an order!

22:10.697 --> 22:12.456
I take responsibility.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.069
I'm Captain Garret Spears.

22:50.663 --> 22:53.097
This is where you offer
your name in return.

22:53.099 --> 22:55.444
What's wrong with those people?

22:57.234 --> 23:00.568
Those are Plaguelings.

23:00.571 --> 23:04.038
And they spread their
disease through that needle

23:04.041 --> 23:05.743
they tried to stick you with.

23:05.745 --> 23:08.412
Do you have a name?

23:09.715 --> 23:11.181
It's Talon.

23:11.183 --> 23:13.550
Talon.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.094
And your reason for coming here...

23:17.097 --> 23:19.464
to this gods-forsaken outpost?

23:19.467 --> 23:21.033
I, um...

23:22.827 --> 23:24.260
I'm here for...

23:24.263 --> 23:25.796
Look, as long as you're making it up,

23:25.798 --> 23:27.464
at least try and make it interesting.

23:27.466 --> 23:31.969
I'll get you started.
You... you are a...

23:31.971 --> 23:34.765
Well, you're a nobleman's daughter.

23:34.768 --> 23:37.124
And your father, he, uh...

23:37.127 --> 23:40.209
He pledged you to be
married to a tyrant.

23:40.212 --> 23:43.280
So, you ran away,

23:43.282 --> 23:46.116
on the day of your betrothal, no less,

23:46.118 --> 23:49.052
to the remotest corner of the realm.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.288
I'm here for work.

23:51.290 --> 23:53.429
- For work?
- As a barmaid.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.668
As a... my story was better.

23:57.671 --> 23:59.504
And mine's more believable.

23:59.507 --> 24:03.576
And it would be, anywhere
else in the world.

24:03.579 --> 24:06.346
But nobody comes to the Outpost

24:06.349 --> 24:08.349
simply to find work.

24:08.352 --> 24:12.154
No, people come here

24:12.157 --> 24:15.358
because they're running from something.

24:19.343 --> 24:20.976
Not me.

24:23.681 --> 24:26.181
I'm not convinced.

24:26.183 --> 24:29.284
But that's all right.

24:29.286 --> 24:32.254
You don't have to convince me.

24:32.256 --> 24:34.389
It's up to Marshal Wythers.

24:35.859 --> 24:37.962
Come on.

24:37.965 --> 24:40.629
I didn't do nothing, Marshal! I swear!

24:43.333 --> 24:46.268
Marshal Wythers.

24:46.270 --> 24:49.696
Stick him in the hole.
I'll work on him later.

24:54.878 --> 24:57.245
What can I do you for, Captain?

24:57.247 --> 24:59.114
Picked up a traveler on the north road.

24:59.116 --> 25:02.250
I can see why. She's a fine catch.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.987
Is that your professional assessment

25:05.989 --> 25:07.589
as Gate Marshal?

25:12.329 --> 25:13.962
I'm a busy man.

25:13.964 --> 25:15.197
Make it quick.

25:15.199 --> 25:16.965
What's your story?

25:16.967 --> 25:19.365
Name's Talon. Here to find work.

25:19.368 --> 25:23.149
- Trade?
- Barmaid.

25:23.152 --> 25:26.374
Well, let's both pretend
you're here for work, yeah?

25:26.376 --> 25:29.678
But cross me, and I'll
stick you out at night

25:29.680 --> 25:32.407
and let those diseased
savages have at you.

25:32.410 --> 25:34.549
Wouldn't expect anything else.

25:34.551 --> 25:36.718
It is what it is.

25:38.355 --> 25:42.023
She's in your custody, Garret.

25:54.034 --> 25:56.201
So where's the best
place to get a drink?

25:56.203 --> 25:59.704
I mean, job... as a barmaid.

25:59.706 --> 26:02.407
The Nightshade Inn.

26:02.409 --> 26:04.809
It's not pretty, but it's all we've got.

26:04.811 --> 26:06.044
Come on. I'll take you.

26:06.046 --> 26:08.029
Just point me in the right direction.

26:08.032 --> 26:12.083
Oh, no. No, you heard my father.

26:12.085 --> 26:13.618
You're still in my custody.

26:13.620 --> 26:17.522
Marshal Wythers is your father?

26:17.524 --> 26:19.553
But your name, Garret Spears?

26:19.556 --> 26:22.454
I chose the name
"Spears" when I enlisted.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.229
I was maybe 14.

26:26.199 --> 26:29.300
Sounds like a name a 14-year-old chose.

26:31.071 --> 26:33.618
So, deep below us are
mines rich with ore.

26:33.621 --> 26:36.414
And we forge weapons, armaments.

26:36.417 --> 26:41.311
As long as we delivery to the prime
order on time, they leave us alone.

26:41.314 --> 26:43.243
So many fires.

26:43.246 --> 26:46.316
Greyskin camps.

26:46.319 --> 26:48.657
My men count them each night.

26:48.660 --> 26:51.060
There's more than fifty score now.

26:51.063 --> 26:52.624
Do they ever attack?

26:52.626 --> 26:55.927
Once. They came up these walls.

26:55.929 --> 26:57.328
But we fought them back,

26:57.330 --> 27:00.164
and it's been quiet for 11 seasons now.

27:00.166 --> 27:01.733
It's why the Eighth Army left

27:01.735 --> 27:03.798
to strengthen the southern front.

27:03.801 --> 27:06.402
I was close to there just days ago.

27:06.405 --> 27:08.905
What news? Have we made any ground?

27:08.908 --> 27:12.540
We haven't heard anything
since the half Redmoon.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.977
I don't know.

27:14.980 --> 27:18.381
Just a lot of fighting, dying.

27:20.845 --> 27:23.513
Yeah, well,

27:23.516 --> 27:25.916
it's a brutal war.

27:25.919 --> 27:29.120
I was stationed there for three seasons.

27:29.123 --> 27:30.928
Watched a lot of good men die

27:30.931 --> 27:33.331
protecting the realm
from those monsters.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.401
Those monsters?

27:36.403 --> 27:39.167
I've see what you Prime
Order soldiers do to people.

27:39.170 --> 27:40.894
Who's protecting us from you?

27:40.897 --> 27:44.086
I'm not Prime Order. I'm a
Captain of the Border Guard.

27:44.089 --> 27:47.912
No difference. You work
for them, you kill for them.

27:47.914 --> 27:51.082
Wow.

27:51.084 --> 27:53.800
You know, the only killing
that I've done recently

27:53.803 --> 27:56.034
is killing Plaguelings
that attacked a woman.

27:56.037 --> 27:58.504
Now does that somehow offend you?

28:00.666 --> 28:02.399
No.

28:05.688 --> 28:10.057
And thank you for saving my life.

28:11.905 --> 28:13.504
I'm in your debt.

28:13.506 --> 28:15.573
It's not something I'm used to.

28:17.031 --> 28:18.364
Thanks for the tour.

28:19.746 --> 28:21.179
Just do me a favor.

28:23.216 --> 28:25.850
Don't do anything that
would get me into trouble

28:25.852 --> 28:28.152
for bringing you inside
these walls, all right?

28:46.072 --> 28:47.839
No blades.

29:06.882 --> 29:08.081
Oh!

29:10.386 --> 29:11.896
Go on, show us what you had.

29:11.898 --> 29:14.480
Uh, a lady never tells.

29:25.979 --> 29:27.714
I need a room and a meal.

29:29.582 --> 29:31.862
It's three beads per night.

29:31.865 --> 29:33.765
Second room on the left.

29:36.423 --> 29:38.156
No guests.

29:38.158 --> 29:40.878
Janzo! Platter.

30:03.416 --> 30:05.083
Wa... wow.

30:05.085 --> 30:08.542
I mean, hello.

30:08.545 --> 30:11.813
I don't think I've ever
met you before, have I?

30:11.816 --> 30:16.352
Don't move. Just wait right here.

30:29.843 --> 30:31.809
- I'm not thirsty.
- Just try it.

30:31.811 --> 30:34.278
- I made it just for you.
- You don't even know me.

30:34.280 --> 30:35.880
Well, you keep licking
your lips, so I start you

30:35.882 --> 30:37.815
with my winter ale for quenching thirst.

30:37.817 --> 30:39.985
And now your shoulders are a
little bit hunched, aren't they?

30:39.987 --> 30:41.415
It's because you're
tired, aren't you, darling?

30:41.417 --> 30:44.555
But that's okay, because I
added a stimulant... bryweed.

30:44.558 --> 30:47.156
It's just the thing to
invigorate the mind and the body.

30:47.159 --> 30:49.760
Now, your jaw's slightly clenched.

30:49.762 --> 30:51.446
It's because you're on
a mission, aren't you?

30:51.448 --> 30:54.292
A tiny amount of sky-vine essence...

30:58.037 --> 31:00.972
You have a gift, barkeeper.

31:00.974 --> 31:02.974
Brewer.

31:02.976 --> 31:07.211
The name's Janzo. Best
brewer in the realm.

31:07.213 --> 31:10.181
And you are?

31:10.183 --> 31:12.683
Not interested in
pursuing whatever this is,

31:12.685 --> 31:14.398
but thanks for the drink.

31:14.401 --> 31:16.219
Captain.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.689
- It's the Captain.
- Captain.

31:20.811 --> 31:25.580
Janzo, one of your special
brews for our esteemed guest.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.946
Hey, brewer.

31:58.918 --> 32:02.353
Keep him drinking. Tell
him it's on the house.

32:02.355 --> 32:06.014
Who? The old creepy guy who's
been watching you all night?

32:09.562 --> 32:11.724
No.

32:11.727 --> 32:13.481
Your esteemed Covenant guest.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.540
Oh, and, uh...

32:22.542 --> 32:24.175
I'll be in my room all night.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.680
No, I'll be in my room all night alone.

32:29.682 --> 32:30.948
Asleep.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.068
Right. Well, um...

32:33.071 --> 32:34.836
good night then.

33:02.757 --> 33:05.424
Aah! Let me go.

33:11.224 --> 33:13.107
I saw you take a key.

33:13.110 --> 33:14.973
You have a room, and I need to hide.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.762
I'm not allowed guests.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.904
Please, I need your help.

33:20.907 --> 33:23.068
There is a man down
there, and if he sees me,

33:23.071 --> 33:24.837
he will kill me.

33:29.078 --> 33:31.609
I'll wait out the night here
and I'll leave in the morning.

33:31.611 --> 33:34.735
Oh, no, you won't.
You're not staying here.

33:34.738 --> 33:38.340
If he sees me, he'll kill me.

33:39.719 --> 33:42.110
Who?

33:42.113 --> 33:43.953
Some guy you hustled at cards?

33:43.956 --> 33:46.056
No, no, it's nothing like that.

33:46.059 --> 33:48.324
He's a Covenant agent, red armor.

33:48.327 --> 33:52.563
- Surely you noticed him.
- Toru Magmoor?

33:52.565 --> 33:54.932
Yes, I think that is his name.

33:54.942 --> 33:59.244
And how do you know it?
You're with him, aren't you?

34:01.807 --> 34:03.774
You came into my room, remember?

34:03.776 --> 34:06.410
If you hurt me, my father
will have you beheaded.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.312
He's the commander
of this whole outpost.

34:08.313 --> 34:12.049
Oh, is he really? Of this whole outpost?

34:12.051 --> 34:16.553
How dare you. I command you to help me.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.782
I'm about to.

34:18.784 --> 34:20.724
Stay here and lock the door.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.427
I'll take care of Magmoor.

34:44.317 --> 34:46.083
He saw me go upstairs.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.918
Your room's not safe.
I'm coming with you.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.286
Where are we going?

34:50.289 --> 34:52.056
I told you I'd take care of it.

34:52.058 --> 34:55.659
I am in grave danger, and
you must escort me home.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.862
Tell me this.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.265
Why would Toru Magmoor want you dead?

35:01.267 --> 35:05.402
First, you tell me how
you know him by name.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.774
Can't you just go away?

35:08.777 --> 35:10.474
The only way you'll get rid of me

35:10.476 --> 35:12.024
is to return me safely home.

35:12.027 --> 35:13.352
Gods.

35:35.234 --> 35:38.702
Garret? Oh, thank the heavens.

35:38.704 --> 35:42.339
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Is something wrong? I... oh!

35:42.341 --> 35:43.374
Um...

35:43.461 --> 35:45.909
Um...

35:45.911 --> 35:47.144
Hello...

35:47.146 --> 35:49.880
again.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.448
Captain.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.751
You know this woman?

35:56.389 --> 35:58.389
No. Well...

35:58.391 --> 36:02.926
No. I met her tonight, um, and, uh...

36:02.928 --> 36:06.641
- I was on...
- The Captain saved my life.

36:06.644 --> 36:08.232
It was very heroic.

36:08.234 --> 36:12.503
Oh. Well, now you saved mine.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.133
One good deed leads to another.

36:14.136 --> 36:15.939
Saved your life? What?

36:15.941 --> 36:18.375
There was a Covenant
agent at The Nightshade.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.910
I think he may have recognized me.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.912
We were not alerted to
a Covenant agent coming.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.480
Get inside.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.664
She's very afraid of
this man, whoever he is.

36:28.667 --> 36:31.368
And you're even more
worried than she is.

36:31.371 --> 36:32.723
Why?

36:34.193 --> 36:36.461
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.555
Just the same,

36:41.558 --> 36:44.459
she promised me five gold
coins upon her safe arrival.

36:44.462 --> 36:46.829
I assume you're the one to pay that?

36:54.447 --> 36:55.646
Good night, Captain.

37:47.396 --> 37:49.596
Do you mind waiting for me to finish?

37:49.598 --> 37:53.267
I've waited 13 years.
That's long enough.

37:53.269 --> 37:55.235
My, my.

37:55.237 --> 37:57.838
That's a vicious tone.

37:57.840 --> 38:01.842
Sounds like vengeance.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.011
Oh.

38:04.013 --> 38:06.647
Who was it?

38:06.649 --> 38:08.849
Who's life did I take
that meant so much to you

38:08.851 --> 38:11.318
that you've come after
me after all these years?

38:11.320 --> 38:13.620
Your father?

38:13.622 --> 38:16.890
Oh. Your mother?

38:16.892 --> 38:19.286
A whole village.

38:19.289 --> 38:21.061
The Vale of Galanth.

38:21.063 --> 38:26.100
Oh, yes. The Blackbloods.

38:26.102 --> 38:27.468
Wiped them all out.

38:29.038 --> 38:32.406
Not all. You missed one.

38:32.408 --> 38:34.008
No. Impossible.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.076
Did you check the tomb?

38:37.179 --> 38:39.246
The girl?

38:39.248 --> 38:41.767
But The Wolf took care
of her. I saw him shoot.

38:41.770 --> 38:43.813
He missed.

38:43.816 --> 38:46.283
Just as well he's close by.

38:46.286 --> 38:49.790
I'll take care of him
once I'm done with you.

38:49.792 --> 38:53.460
Close by? Here at The Outpost?

38:53.462 --> 38:55.929
Oh, didn't you know? Yes.

38:55.931 --> 38:57.931
He's close enough to spit on.

38:57.933 --> 38:59.767
Who is he?

38:59.769 --> 39:03.537
It makes no difference to you.

39:03.539 --> 39:05.406
In a moment, you'll be dying.

39:05.408 --> 39:07.919
Then just tell me this. Why?

39:09.378 --> 39:11.011
We were well paid.

39:11.013 --> 39:13.247
Who paid you?

39:13.249 --> 39:18.352
"Kill every Blackblood."

39:18.354 --> 39:20.587
That's all he said.

39:20.589 --> 39:22.756
And now I need to finish the job.

40:13.275 --> 40:14.634
Who paid you? Tell me!

41:23.245 --> 41:25.579
Who are you? Huh?
