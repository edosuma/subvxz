WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.968
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:37.328 --> 00:38.371
<i>Nazrovia.</i>

01:05.315 --> 01:06.941
They're waiting for you, Micky.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.165
Get going.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.714
Knock before barging in.

01:36.679 --> 01:39.808
You can't go on
without singing the chorus again, okay?

01:40.892 --> 01:41.976
Then you sing it!

01:42.852 --> 01:44.270
See if you can.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.931
He's done.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.142
He's done?

02:22.642 --> 02:23.601
Relax.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
You'll do great.

02:26.062 --> 02:26.896
Look at that.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.816
You're up after Tony Bennett.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.654
Scary, isn't it?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.995
If you don't sing, they don't pay, Micky.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.456
You know that.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.312
Tony Bennett sent bottles to the hotel.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.980
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.444
I can't believe Tony Bennett's face.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.154
Never mind his face,

05:21.237 --> 05:22.530
Magnum's face!

05:23.072 --> 05:24.615
Did you see Magnum's face?

05:24.699 --> 05:26.909
He was too shy
to ask you for your autograph.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.119
He gave a good speech.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.955
Damn, he introduced you as a god.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.750
You know, Patricio?

05:33.833 --> 05:35.501
We have to seize this moment

05:35.585 --> 05:38.713
and do something
that'll take us to the next level.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.008
Do a duet with someone of that caliber.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.217
A duet with Magnum?

05:45.720 --> 05:46.554
No.

05:48.222 --> 05:49.057
Tony Bennett.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.479
Why not someone younger?

05:55.313 --> 05:56.939
Okay, who?

05:58.941 --> 05:59.859
Bryan Adams?

06:02.403 --> 06:03.237
Sting.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.448
Annie Lennox.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.409
Or Prince! Prince was there.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.205
Sure. I'll set it up, as soon as
you finish recording "Nada es Igual"

06:12.288 --> 06:14.999
and we finish the promotional tour and--

06:15.083 --> 06:17.585
So, in what? Two years? Three?

06:17.668 --> 06:18.920
No, one year, tops.

06:19.420 --> 06:22.340
Be patient, just wait
until you hear our proposal.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.926
It's crazy.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.554
This has never happened in Latin America.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.599
You'll be known all the way in Patagonia.

06:31.682 --> 06:35.228
You wanted an introductory letter
to sing in Las Vegas? This is it.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.730
They'll buy your albums--

06:37.814 --> 06:38.815
Are you listening?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.584
- No way.
- Watch and learn, man.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.022
What did you expect?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.900
It's Mariah Carey.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.038
I think we should leave.
It's getting late.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.083
I want to ski early tomorrow.

07:40.877 --> 07:41.711
Let's go.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.069
Terrible timing, man!

08:48.152 --> 08:50.780
We have a concert
in three hours in Tijuana.

08:53.908 --> 08:54.784
Come on.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.577
We can't be late.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.288
We'll lose other concerts.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.542
Look, we still have 20 <i>palenques</i> to do.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.584
Let's go.

09:06.045 --> 09:06.879
Please, come on.

09:08.965 --> 09:09.966
Maybe.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.094
Maybe not.

09:17.848 --> 09:18.891
What does that mean?

09:23.688 --> 09:24.522
That

09:26.023 --> 09:27.650
maybe

09:28.901 --> 09:31.612
I'm sick of singing at those places.

09:35.116 --> 09:38.077
Or maybe I don't want you
to work for me anymore.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.251
Are you firing me?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.505
Maybe I am.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.011
Fuck you, asshole.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.000
Hey, is Macho losing?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.297
How could Macho be losing?

10:31.964 --> 10:33.632
The only way to beat him

10:33.716 --> 10:34.884
is by cheating.

10:36.802 --> 10:37.803
Like with Trinidad.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.057
Or Chávez.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.517
That was an unfair steal!

10:44.185 --> 10:45.019
Huge.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.479
May I sit?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.318
Look at him move.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.697
Here he goes!

10:57.323 --> 10:58.658
Come on, Macho!

10:58.741 --> 11:00.868
Good one!

11:01.827 --> 11:04.455
Impossible to get him.
Puerto Rican are good boxers.

11:07.041 --> 11:07.875
The best.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.046
Where are you from?

11:12.963 --> 11:13.798
Uruguay.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.841
José Pérez, a pleasure.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.760
Where are you from?

11:17.843 --> 11:20.805
- San Juan.
- Isn't that a coincidence?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.139
<i>Amigo.</i>

12:04.682 --> 12:06.684
ARIES PRODUCTIONS

12:13.482 --> 12:15.192
Honey, put this in my office.

12:31.208 --> 12:32.084
Karlita,

12:33.502 --> 12:34.503
nice jacket.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.213
Nice of you to notice.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.633
Cousin! How are my aunt and uncle?

12:40.176 --> 12:41.761
Good. On vacation.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.054
Again? Always traveling.

12:45.848 --> 12:46.766
Am I right?

12:48.225 --> 12:50.603
When is the video shoot confirmed for?

12:50.686 --> 12:51.520
Friday.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.731
Send the jet
Thursday night to bring Micky.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.400
The brat insisted
he wanted to stay in Aspen.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.945
- Okay?
- We can't send the jet anywhere right now.

13:00.029 --> 13:00.863
Why not?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.366
Let's say we have cash flow problems.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.371
The office didn't come for free.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.208
Last month, you remodeled
the whole second floor.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.502
We have an in-house chef.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.254
- You travel in a private jet.
- I get it.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.423
And you can't make what you make.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.341
Really?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.595
So, you tell me, please.
What should we do?

13:24.678 --> 13:26.597
We're doing Micky's promotional tour.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.893
- It'll bring in liquidity.
- There is no liquidity. It doesn't exist.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.813
Listen, we can't even pay
this month's payroll.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.564
And I don't want any lawsuits.

13:43.823 --> 13:47.034
How much did Warner give us
for the "Sueña" video? Same as usual?

13:47.868 --> 13:48.702
Yes.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.788
- In fact--
- Yes or no?

13:51.413 --> 13:53.082
- Yes, more than last time.
- Okay.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.043
Lily, get me Gustavo Garzón, the director.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.173
It's fine, just relax, you two.

14:26.824 --> 14:27.908
May I come in, Micky?

14:32.454 --> 14:34.123
Speak of the devil.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.040
How did it go?

14:35.541 --> 14:36.625
Great.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.378
I was at the bar
with the Puerto Rican until 3:00 a.m.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.715
She came to buy a house, apparently.

14:43.215 --> 14:48.012
And she's staying with a friend, an actor.
But she won't be here long.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.430
She's looking at houses?

14:49.513 --> 14:53.851
No, she's fixated with one house
with a view to who knows what mountain.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.313
- What I know is she offered a ton of cash.
- Did he say where it is?

14:57.396 --> 14:58.564
Yes.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.484
Here.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.492
- Hold on to it.
- Sure.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.370
See you downstairs.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.373
Joe! Good job.

15:18.792 --> 15:19.627
Well done.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.128
At your service, sir.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.684
Oh, well, Gus.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.270
You know he's swamped.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.148
He doesn't have time to make such a video.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.903
Why do you need
more days on set and more money?

15:45.986 --> 15:48.238
To make another mess
like yesterday's video?

15:49.448 --> 15:51.742
Look, Gus, you're the director.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.661
Find a solution

15:53.744 --> 15:55.871
or let me know and I'll ask someone else.

15:57.081 --> 15:57.915
Great!

15:58.540 --> 16:00.250
See you back here. Bye!

16:02.044 --> 16:03.128
There you go.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.964
- Enough to cover the payroll.
- What about next month?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.843
Are you gonna cut
the budgets for all the album's videos?

16:11.053 --> 16:14.807
As soon as money starts pouring in
from the promotional tour, we'll be fine.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.225
Relax, cousin.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.811
Yes, Lily?

16:19.561 --> 16:20.396
Put him through.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.606
Micky!

16:24.817 --> 16:25.776
You're on your way?

16:28.404 --> 16:29.947
A house? What house?

16:31.615 --> 16:32.574
In Aspen?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.910
Why do you--? Okay.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.579
Sure, Micky.
Julián is here with me, I'll tell him.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.791
Tell José to send the information, okay?

16:40.874 --> 16:42.292
Hugs, bye.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.217
He wants us to make
an offer on a house in Aspen, today.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.018
I don't think your brother is coming out.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.521
He'll come out.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.023
Give him a few minutes.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.368
He's coming.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.832
Hi, Micky.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.000
How are you, guys?

18:05.084 --> 18:08.754
I brought the office expenses,
this bungalow's, the Acapulco house's,

18:08.837 --> 18:10.714
and last year's earnings.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.842
- So you can get an idea of--
- What do you want to listen to?

18:15.385 --> 18:19.765
Some R&B or jazz?

18:20.933 --> 18:24.853
Plus child support
and the Fernández tour cancellation.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.109
Who?

18:31.110 --> 18:31.944
Sorry.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.154
That tour from hell.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.949
We have to cut costs, Micky.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.993
Don't tell me you came
to talk about money, Pichita.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.541
No, Micky, of course not.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.253
I mean, it's important we--

18:49.336 --> 18:51.505
Azucena, wait, we'll talk in a minute.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.715
You know? You have the expense report.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.425
Micky, please look it over.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.264
- Thanks, Alex, bye.
- Azucena, please--

19:02.391 --> 19:03.267
Listen, Micky,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.145
it's important we go over this stuff.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.525
Plus, we need to talk to you

19:12.526 --> 19:15.028
about candidates to replace your manager.

19:15.529 --> 19:18.365
Who are you bringing?
Another idiot like Daniel?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.911
Someone has to be your manager.

19:26.373 --> 19:27.374
Have Azucena do it.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.668
Azucena handles your finances,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.087
your promotion, your networks.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.005
My what?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.425
Your networks,
Micky, your social networks.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.677
Facebook, Twitter, all that shit.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.931
The point is Azucena
is already doing the job of five people.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.272
Okay then, tell me, Pichita,
who do you want to hire?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.316
Well, my favorite candidate,

19:53.150 --> 19:55.068
she's Venezuelan, young:

19:55.986 --> 19:57.279
Cristina Valecillos.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.864
She's great.

19:58.947 --> 20:01.033
She has experience in TV, radio.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.117
She's perfect.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.035
Okay.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.580
And how do you know her?

20:07.497 --> 20:09.082
She works here, with Balaguer.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.168
She's five minutes away, I'll bring her.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.057
So, she works with Ambrosi?

20:29.895 --> 20:34.608
She's perfect for the job, Micky.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.414
Did he recommend her?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.505
- It doesn't matter who--
- Did he recommend her or not?

21:18.068 --> 21:18.902
Hello?

21:20.153 --> 21:22.114
<i>Listen here, motherfucker.</i>

21:23.198 --> 21:25.534
<i>If you ever contact
someone from my team again,</i>

21:25.617 --> 21:29.579
<i>I'll make sure you never work
again for the rest of your fucking life.</i>

21:30.789 --> 21:32.874
Micky, your brother Alex called me.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.502
All I did was give him a name.

21:35.585 --> 21:39.381
I don't care if he called you
or if you ran into him in the street.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.217
Don't get close to my people.

21:42.301 --> 21:46.805
<i>No need to worry about that, it's been
six years since I spoke to your people.</i>

21:46.888 --> 21:47.931
Keep it that way.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.184
If I ever hear you got close
to something of mine,

21:52.227 --> 21:55.439
this time I'll make sure
you regret it for the rest of your life.

21:56.106 --> 21:56.940
Got it?

22:13.623 --> 22:14.499
Coming!

23:22.943 --> 23:24.111
You don't want cheese?

23:24.694 --> 23:25.821
It's the one you like.

23:26.738 --> 23:27.739
No, thanks, Mom.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.492
So, what's new, sweetie?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.327
You never call.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.496
I've been really busy.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.457
- How's work going? Good?
- Good.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.378
I represent the biggest
Spanish-language singer

23:41.461 --> 23:43.922
and invoice double
what dad's law firm does.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.883
So, I'd say good.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.760
Well, if you're happy,

23:49.469 --> 23:51.221
I'm happy.

23:51.304 --> 23:54.391
- But come visit more often.
- Welcome.

23:54.474 --> 23:57.436
- He's the Head of the Central Bank.
- Pal!

23:58.478 --> 24:02.190
- Welcome, make yourself at home.
- Thank you. Sorry I'm late.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.108
It's fine.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.569
Time for introductions.
Octavio, you know him.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.904
- Hi, Octavio.
- How nice to see you again.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.323
Congratulations on Grupo México.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.993
- Thanks.
- I read about it in the papers.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.580
This is Gabriel,
who's just joined the firm.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.166
I've been so eager
to meet you, sir. Welcome.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.500
A pleasure, Gabriel.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.836
I'm glad the dynasty is growing.

24:22.919 --> 24:25.005
So your old man can retire.

24:26.381 --> 24:27.674
And Patricio,

24:29.384 --> 24:30.218
our youngest.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.220
Patricio, how are you?

24:32.304 --> 24:35.849
Patricio is working
on other projects, you know.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.893
Great, excellent.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.729
And this is Julián,
my brother Francisco's son.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.273
- We met at Yale.
- Of course!

24:43.356 --> 24:47.986
- You're from the ITAM gang!
- That's me, right.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.723
...in 1972, Namibia with Correa.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.434
- Carmen, your namesake.
- Really?

26:01.518 --> 26:03.937
Well, they invited me on a safari.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.313
- No!
- Yeah!

26:05.397 --> 26:06.648
I've never been back,

26:06.731 --> 26:08.817
but it was particularly special.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.571
We traveled in Asian luxury.

26:13.154 --> 26:16.157
Natives that served you
in the middle of the jungle.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.536
- Where?
- Camping in the middle of the jungle!

26:20.328 --> 26:22.289
By the way, I never saw a lion.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.791
I guess we were in one of those parks--

26:24.874 --> 26:26.876
A reserve, rather.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.549
'Cause you reach there by horse

26:32.632 --> 26:35.176
or by camel, whatever.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.143
One more story about the Correas,

26:43.226 --> 26:45.270
and I'll take out grandpa's shotgun.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.736
We should talk to Warner.

26:53.486 --> 26:57.115
I want to double the budget
we have for the album campaign.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.996
Pato, Julio won't give you another cent.

27:03.079 --> 27:03.913
Wanna bet?

27:07.292 --> 27:08.627
Don't be a pussy, man.

30:57.146 --> 30:58.147
Let's see.

31:02.402 --> 31:03.987
It's too hard, I can't.

31:04.904 --> 31:07.115
Well, be patient, it's a new language.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.493
New? I've been here a year
and I haven't learned anything.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.036
Okay, time for dinner.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.376
I'm not hungry.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.837
It wasn't a question.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.755
Go on, before it gets cold.

31:26.634 --> 31:27.969
You really don't want any?

31:30.263 --> 31:31.472
I don't want to be here.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.646
This is our house, Sergiño.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.408
Want your brothers to visit?

33:16.577 --> 33:17.412
Cut!

33:18.830 --> 33:20.164
How was it, Garzón?

33:20.248 --> 33:21.916
- Divine, Micky, divine.
- Yeah.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.336
Hey, I think we should do
that last part again.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.714
No, we've got it. We're good.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.215
What do you mean we're good?

33:31.384 --> 33:32.510
Robles, come.

33:32.593 --> 33:33.845
José, hey!

33:35.221 --> 33:36.264
Please!

33:36.347 --> 33:37.557
- Okay.
- What's up?

33:38.808 --> 33:40.977
One take? Really?

33:41.060 --> 33:43.896
Micky, we're splicing in the cartoon,

33:43.980 --> 33:44.981
don't worry.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.860
Pato, it's Disney,
don't tell me the budget's a problem.

33:48.943 --> 33:53.531
I said so to Gustavo, he says it's
more important for the movie to shine.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.033
No! Well, you should've told me.

33:56.117 --> 34:00.246
I was thinking this was going to be
this huge production, not an ad.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.874
- Didn't Gustavo tell you?
- No.

34:02.957 --> 34:04.459
He should've.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.921
But look, this isn't your single,

34:09.005 --> 34:10.715
it's just a video for a movie.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.220
Now I feel bad for not telling you, sorry.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.514
It's not your fault, relax. Let's go, Joe.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.519
Micky, great job. Bye.

34:31.652 --> 34:32.570
Everything good?

34:33.362 --> 34:34.697
Of course! You know him.

34:36.824 --> 34:40.036
- I have a feeling you're lying to me.
- We're done for today.

34:41.954 --> 34:42.872
Right.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.457
Okay, guys!

34:48.711 --> 34:50.671
He found out I talked to you and--

34:50.755 --> 34:51.672
You know!

34:51.756 --> 34:53.674
Now he won't answer my calls.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.635
<i>I'm sorry, Alex.</i>

34:56.886 --> 34:58.179
<i>That's all I can say.</i>

34:59.680 --> 35:00.848
Don't worry about it.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.684
You know something?

35:04.519 --> 35:06.270
He always stops talking to me.

35:06.354 --> 35:09.690
<i>-I guess I shouldn't ask about Cristina.</i>
- No, man.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.776
No. He won't even meet her.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.863
It's his loss, she would've been
perfect for him. Perfect.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.365
<i>Thanks for helping me out.</i>

35:19.659 --> 35:22.829
<i>I don't know if I would've done
the same in your position, man.</i>

35:23.579 --> 35:25.081
<i>-Thanks.
-</i> No problem.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.584
I still care about your brother.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.003
<i>Oh, one more thing.</i>

35:32.255 --> 35:33.172
<i>Who's with him?</i>

35:34.590 --> 35:35.508
I don't know,

35:36.676 --> 35:37.885
his girlfriend.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.221
<i>I think she's his girlfriend.</i>

35:41.681 --> 35:42.557
Take care of him.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.309
Don't leave him alone, Alex, please.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.269
<i>Don't worry.</i>

35:47.728 --> 35:48.771
He'll be fine.

35:50.106 --> 35:50.940
Okay?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.986
<i>Keep me posted, you know where to find me.</i>

35:56.154 --> 35:57.029
<i>You bet.</i>

36:04.287 --> 36:06.038
- Come in.
- Nice.

36:06.789 --> 36:08.583
- So?
- Frankly, it's amazing.

36:08.666 --> 36:09.917
Nice studio, right?

36:10.001 --> 36:13.462
Yeah. Now, who's putting up for all this?

36:14.380 --> 36:15.298
We are.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.383
Good.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.677
Just keep those finances in order.

36:22.555 --> 36:24.515
How about the video? All good?

36:24.599 --> 36:26.267
Actually, it's divine.

36:26.893 --> 36:27.810
I'm glad.

36:29.061 --> 36:29.979
Yeah.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.190
Julio,

36:32.982 --> 36:35.610
I want Warner to put up
more for the album promotion.

36:37.862 --> 36:41.407
More? We're already spending more
than on any other album.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.288
I want double.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.875
You're screwing with me?

36:54.587 --> 36:57.715
Look, Pato, even if I wanted to,
Warner doesn't have that much.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.050
Julio!

36:59.133 --> 37:02.345
I don't know if you heard,
but there's a crisis going on here.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.681
I can give you 10% more.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.519
Maybe 15%, tops.

37:15.024 --> 37:15.983
I want double.

37:16.984 --> 37:20.321
This will be Luis Miguel's
top-selling album, and you know it.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.283
Aries should put up the cash.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.243
Really?

37:25.326 --> 37:26.911
I mean it.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.497
Put up the promotion money,

37:29.580 --> 37:32.250
and when the sales come in,
I'll pay you back.

37:32.333 --> 37:37.380
Contrary to what's at stake for Warner,
if the album tanks, we could go broke.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.966
Didn't you just say you know it will sell?

37:44.053 --> 37:45.429
If you want more cash,

37:46.138 --> 37:47.515
that's the only way.

37:58.234 --> 37:59.151
How's he doing?

37:59.860 --> 38:00.903
How's school?

38:01.904 --> 38:04.448
<i>Well, it's been
really hard for him to adapt.</i>

38:05.491 --> 38:07.118
What about tutoring?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.495
<i>Coming along,</i>

38:11.205 --> 38:12.331
<i>slowly but surely.</i>

38:13.165 --> 38:14.250
Put him through.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.335
I want to talk to him.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.755
<i>Micky, you know--</i>

38:20.965 --> 38:21.924
<i>He doesn't want to.</i>

38:23.092 --> 38:23.926
He what?

38:26.262 --> 38:27.430
Give me a second.

38:27.513 --> 38:29.307
Mr. Patricio Robles is here.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.767
- I'll be right there.
- Yes.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.397
Doc, I'll be there tomorrow.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.398
Tell Sergio.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.359
He can't just not talk
to me, I'm his brother.

38:41.193 --> 38:43.237
From Europe to Mexico and Latin America,

38:44.155 --> 38:46.115
plus the US in two weeks?

38:46.907 --> 38:48.659
Pato, this is brutal.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.330
I told you you've never
done a tour like this.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.498
This long? Never!

38:55.666 --> 38:57.418
And with all these musicians.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.462
And your own engineers.

38:59.545 --> 39:03.424
On stage, you'll sound
exactly like you do on the album.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.177
No, this is--

39:07.053 --> 39:07.970
It's too much.

39:11.807 --> 39:12.975
You wanted a challenge?

39:14.143 --> 39:16.395
This is it, I promise.

39:18.773 --> 39:22.193
This is your first album
under Aries Productions, your company.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.403
It needs to explode, Micky.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.529
Yes.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.031
You're my company's CEO,

39:27.114 --> 39:28.866
you should be the one to worry.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.414
That's why I convinced Warner
to give us more money than ever.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.921
We don't just have promotion covered.

39:43.422 --> 39:47.468
You'll be on every radio station
in Latin America.

39:48.594 --> 39:51.180
You'll be number one in the region

39:51.263 --> 39:53.307
within a week, what more do you want?

39:54.141 --> 39:55.267
Julio approved this?

39:57.937 --> 40:00.940
Yes, but you have to do the tour.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.652
Fine.

40:06.737 --> 40:07.738
Consider it done.

40:17.998 --> 40:21.210
Oh, Alex! I'm thinking of moving to LA.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.840
- For your new girlfriend?
- She's not my girlfriend.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.927
She's not your girlfriend yet.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.933
You should go to Spain.

40:36.016 --> 40:37.143
No way!

40:37.226 --> 40:38.644
A new start for us both.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.897
If I go to Madrid,
I'll never see you two again.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.066
- That's what you like, isn't it?
- Yes.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.986
That's what matters.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.029
Thanks.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.118
- I'll miss you, man.
- I'll miss you too, bro.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.510
He won't come down.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.095
What?

41:16.182 --> 41:18.642
Fine, I'll stay here
until he agrees to see me.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.105
Want me to go up and convince him?

41:24.106 --> 41:25.524
I talk to him all the time.

41:27.610 --> 41:31.238
Why don't you go up, Micky?
I think it's best if you two talk alone.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.281
Just you and him.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.286
Sure.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.009
Sergiño, may I?

42:00.559 --> 42:01.393
Look,

42:02.269 --> 42:05.022
I brought your World Cup album
with your stickers.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.732
You left it back home in Mexico.

42:12.404 --> 42:15.157
Sergiño, I get why you're still mad at me,

42:16.450 --> 42:20.079
but you can't just not take my calls,
act like this when I come visit--

42:21.914 --> 42:22.790
And be like this.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.668
If you wanted to see me,
you wouldn't have sent me here.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.130
Sergiño,

42:32.174 --> 42:34.843
you know it's more complicated than that.

42:34.927 --> 42:37.096
You don't have to come, really.

42:37.179 --> 42:40.015
I want to come.
I want to see you, I miss you.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.310
You know what work is like.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.564
- It's complicated.
- Then, don't bother dropping by.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.283
Is that what you want?

43:07.334 --> 43:08.252
Fine, Sergio.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.170
You got it.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.770
Stop worrying about Sergio.

43:26.854 --> 43:28.188
He'll get over it.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.357
I'll come over this week and talk to him.

43:30.441 --> 43:33.527
- He has to forgive you.
- No, he doesn't have to do anything.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.364
I'm the one who has to pay for
his tuition, his clothes, his house.

43:37.448 --> 43:41.327
- Yeah, but he's a kid, he doesn't get it.
- He'll soon have to get it.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.089
Julio suggested Aries put up the money.

43:55.257 --> 43:56.759
Please tell me you said no.

43:57.676 --> 44:00.721
Do you remember
what we told you the other day?

44:00.804 --> 44:03.515
We barely have enough
to cover the payroll, Patricio.

44:04.391 --> 44:07.811
Where will we get
millions of dollars to promote the album?

44:07.895 --> 44:09.730
Shut the door, please.

44:19.907 --> 44:21.367
From Luis Miguel's account.

44:24.078 --> 44:25.454
We have access, don't we?

44:27.790 --> 44:29.541
- You mean steal from him?
- No.

44:30.417 --> 44:33.420
I'm talking about a loan
to promote his album.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.882
- What's the matter?
- Where should I start?

44:36.965 --> 44:37.883
Karlita,

44:39.009 --> 44:42.179
either we're all
on the same page or this won't work.

44:44.348 --> 44:45.182
I repeat,

44:46.809 --> 44:47.935
what's the matter?

44:54.233 --> 44:55.651
He won't even notice.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.863
Use the money he was going to spend
on the Aspen house

44:59.947 --> 45:02.783
and buy TV, radio, and press spots.

45:02.866 --> 45:04.660
I want him to be everywhere.

45:07.204 --> 45:10.457
This will be
Luis Miguel's top-selling album.

46:03.135 --> 46:04.344
Again, damn it?

46:11.769 --> 46:12.728
Damn it!

51:40.138 --> 51:45.143
