WEBVTT

00:05.222 --> 00:08.312
- Hey, Jay, before you go...
- Yeah, what's up, Trudy?

00:08.356 --> 00:10.706
- I've been holding on to mail
and notifications for Upton.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.143
There's a few subpoenas,
not that I looked,

00:13.187 --> 00:15.754
but there's some must-appear
court dates next week.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.757
- Oh.
Uh, yeah.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.411
I'll just--I'll cover these
till she gets back.

00:20.455 --> 00:22.283
If she gets back.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.501
- What are you talking about?

00:23.545 --> 00:25.068
- The feds have
a really sneaky way

00:25.112 --> 00:26.678
of holding on to good people.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.724
They make them wear nice suits,
and they pay them really well.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.769
- Well, Hailey doesn't like
nice suits.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.076
- Uh-huh, I'm sure she doesn't.
You miss her, don't you?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.165
- Yeah.
She's my partner.

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- Of course.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.429
- What do you say we get
something to eat?

00:38.473 --> 00:40.736
I'm starving.
- Oh, uh...

00:40.779 --> 00:42.085
You know, I'm a little tired.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.521
I think I'm gonna call it
a day.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.740
- Come on, there's a new place
in Old Town

00:44.783 --> 00:46.263
that's supposed to be
really good.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.743
- I'm sure it is.
I'm just not very hungry.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.310
- So get a beer.
Watch me eat.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.747
I, uh...

00:54.489 --> 00:56.099
- Ah.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.406
Copy, you--you have plans.
Got it.

00:59.407 --> 01:00.451
- I would totally invite you--

01:00.495 --> 01:01.713
- No, no, no.
It's good.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.280
I'm glad you're out there
having fun.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.501
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

01:06.544 --> 01:08.807
- Okay.
- Have fun.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.810
- ♪ I'm going to chapel

01:14.596 --> 01:17.642
♪ Going to chapel

01:19.688 --> 01:22.865
♪ Where we wed

01:26.390 --> 01:27.739
- Adam?
- Yeah?

01:27.783 --> 01:29.611
- Do you want another one?

01:29.654 --> 01:32.135
- Sheri, I already told you
I gotta work early tomorrow.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.659
Don't tempt me.
- Oh, you're so responsible.

01:34.703 --> 01:36.835
- No one has ever accused me
of that before.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.536
I get outta here in 20 minutes.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.148
If you can stay up that late...
- Yeah?

01:45.192 --> 01:47.759
- Maybe we should just go back
to my place.

01:47.803 --> 01:52.199
- ♪ In my melody,
in my way ♪

01:53.809 --> 01:55.898
I just asked you not to tempt
me, and here we go again.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.770
Just like last week, huh?

01:58.814 --> 02:01.425
Yeah, I'm gonna go outside,
I'm gonna get some fresh air,

02:01.469 --> 02:03.210
and I'll see you in 20.

02:03.253 --> 02:06.909
- All right.
- All right.

02:45.295 --> 02:47.602
- Hey!

02:47.645 --> 02:49.647
- Hey!

02:49.691 --> 02:51.562
Hey!

02:51.606 --> 02:52.911
Hey!

02:55.566 --> 02:57.307
This is Adam Ruzek,
off-duty CPD.

02:57.351 --> 02:58.569
Sir, I need your car!

02:58.613 --> 02:59.962
I just witnessed
a possible kidnapping.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.877
- What are you talking about?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.487
- I'm CPD, give me your car.
- We have a babysitter at home.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.228
- Give me your keys right now!
Now!

03:05.272 --> 03:06.708
Move.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.666
Young woman was violently
shoved into a silver SUV.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.755
At least two offenders inside.
I'm in pursuit.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.979
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.863
Aah!

03:31.907 --> 03:35.650
Ugh.
Oh, son...

03:46.530 --> 03:47.923
- Uh-huh.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.969
How you doing?

03:51.013 --> 03:53.363
- Well, I'll tell you what.
Those airbags are no joke.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.888
- A few cuts and bruises,
but no signs of a concussion.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.499
He'll be fine.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.544
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yeah.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.069
- You know it's not
what it looks like.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.376
- I sure hope not.

04:06.420 --> 04:07.856
I saw the kidnapping.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.684
I commandeered the car
to give chase.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.989
As I rounded the corner,

04:11.033 --> 04:12.382
there were some pedestrians
in the street,

04:12.426 --> 04:13.688
so I swerved to avoid them.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.385
- You sure you saw
a kidnapping?

04:15.429 --> 04:16.691
- I'm 100% sure.

04:16.734 --> 04:17.735
There was at least
two kidnappers.

04:17.779 --> 04:19.694
One of them was driving.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.478
- Make and model
of the vehicle?

04:21.522 --> 04:24.481
- A Silver Isuzu Rodeo.
Couldn't get the plates.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.615
- Responding officer
smelled liquor on your breath.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.312
I'm guessing
you're gonna blow high.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.836
- Boss, I saw
a violent abduction.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.708
I took action.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.318
You know, drinking
or no drinking,

04:35.362 --> 04:36.493
the woman needed help.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.929
I'll take that beef
all week long.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.409
- All right,
I'll talk to the patrolman,

04:39.453 --> 04:40.584
make sure he understands
what happened.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.673
- Thank you.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.675
- Witnesses?
- Not many.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.764
None sober.
Nobody saw the kidnapping.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.549
- Yeah, the couple that owns
the car Adam used--

04:48.592 --> 04:49.767
we got them to calm down.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.769
Mostly.
We sent them home in a Lyft.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.684
- All right, loop in
Halstead and Burgess.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.339
Canvass for more witnesses,
security cams.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.601
Let's find out what happened.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.082
- Copy that.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.867
- You got your head
in the game?

05:02.911 --> 05:04.565
- I'm good.
- All right.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.696
Let's head back
to the district,

05:05.740 --> 05:07.350
put a pot of coffee on.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.091
You're running point on this.
- All right.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.050
- Hey.
You okay?

05:12.094 --> 05:13.748
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

05:13.791 --> 05:15.010
- Yes.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.794
Boss, uh,

05:16.838 --> 05:18.405
Platt's looking into all
new missing person's reports.

05:18.448 --> 05:19.841
- All right,
let's start at the beginning.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.408
Describe the woman
who was abducted.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.974
- I only saw her briefly,

05:23.018 --> 05:25.760
but she was a blonde Caucasian,
about 5'8", early 20s.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.763
- What about the guy?
- I never saw his face.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.068
He was wearing a brown jacket,

05:30.112 --> 05:31.940
navy blue hoodie,
had gloves on.

05:31.983 --> 05:35.465
I'd say 5'11", 170 pounds,
athletic build.

05:35.509 --> 05:37.772
- Have we found any evidence
to corroborate Adam's account?

05:37.815 --> 05:39.121
- No, sir, not yet.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.905
There's no POD cameras
on that block.

05:40.949 --> 05:42.516
- I'll go check businesses in
the area as soon as they open.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.169
- I reached out
to all the districts,

05:44.213 --> 05:45.954
combed through
the missing persons reports.

05:45.997 --> 05:47.477
Nobody fitting
the woman's description

05:47.521 --> 05:48.826
has been reported missing.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.175
- Well, it's only been
three hours.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.742
They probably don't know
she's gone yet.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.396
- All right, so get
with a composite artist.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.703
Generate a sketch.
Rest of you, keep digging.

05:55.746 --> 05:57.139
Let's ID this woman

05:57.182 --> 05:58.706
so we can find out
what happened to her.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.536
- I thought you were
a city worker.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.015
- Well, technically,
that's what a cop is.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.016
- Really?

06:05.060 --> 06:06.801
- Hey, thanks for seeing us.

06:06.844 --> 06:08.019
Uh, did you happen to see
a woman who looked like this

06:08.063 --> 06:09.412
last night?

06:09.456 --> 06:11.109
- Uh, it's hard
to say for sure.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.763
I mean, it gets pretty crazy
in here.

06:12.807 --> 06:15.418
Right, officer?

06:15.462 --> 06:17.812
- Look, Sheri, I'm sorry I
can't get into this right now.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.117
A girl was kidnapped.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.554
I gotta see
your security footage.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.949
- PJ's the manager.
He's in back.

06:24.993 --> 06:27.648
- I am sorry.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.867
- I'm also gonna need credit
card receipts from last night.

06:29.911 --> 06:33.436
- Yeah, I got them over here.

06:34.785 --> 06:37.614
- Hey, hopefully, uh, you
didn't confess to any crimes.

06:37.658 --> 06:38.920
- Call me old-fashioned.

06:38.963 --> 06:41.052
I just like to know
who I'm sleeping with.

06:42.184 --> 06:43.838
- Yeah, I get that.
I just--

06:43.881 --> 06:45.535
Technically, he didn't lie.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.058
He just, um,
left out some details.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.887
- Yeah, important details.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.236
The truth is,
it doesn't really matter.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.064
He's just hung up on his ex.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.936
It's all he talked about.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.200
- Give the guy time.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.984
I'll take this.
- Yeah.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.986
- Thanks.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.923
- I mean, that's it.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.751
Now we know for sure
she wasn't in that bar.

07:27.795 --> 07:29.144
- No.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.975
All we have is this shot
of the back of her head

07:34.018 --> 07:35.498
on the outside security cam,

07:35.542 --> 07:36.891
and there's no cameras
along the way.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.762
- Guys, I may have something.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.590
I ran the names on those credit
card receipts you gave me.

07:40.634 --> 07:42.026
- Ah, we just have bad news.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.767
We just confirmed
she wasn't in the bar.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.595
- Oh, I wasn't looking
at the bar.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.902
I checked the social media
accounts of all the women

07:47.945 --> 07:49.556
that were there.
- Mm-hmm.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.861
- I mean, I cross-referenced
them to the neighborhood

07:50.905 --> 07:52.559
and time of the abduction.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.735
A tourist posted a story
on her Instagram.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.563
I mean, this is
right outside of the bar

07:56.606 --> 07:57.912
where you said
you saw everything.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.525
- Great night with my girls.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.961
- Can you blow that up?

08:07.008 --> 08:09.576
- That's enough for facial rec.

08:09.619 --> 08:13.231
That's good work, Vanessa.
That's good work.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.103
Okay, this is the woman
I saw get abducted,

08:15.146 --> 08:16.583
Charlotte Henslow.

08:16.626 --> 08:17.801
No one's reported her
missing yet,

08:17.845 --> 08:19.237
but this is definitely her.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.239
She's 21 years old.
She's got zero sheet.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.980
- She's got the opposite
of a sheet.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.156
She's like a saint.
Pulled up her Twitter feed.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.897
She's really active
in her church,

08:26.941 --> 08:28.333
tweets about helping
immigrants, homeless people...

08:28.377 --> 08:29.987
- Pinged her phone.

08:30.031 --> 08:31.249
The last read was on the block
she was abducted,

08:31.293 --> 08:32.686
but it's
definitely cut off now.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.601
- Her address
is in Edison Park.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.168
3719 Bunker Hill.
It's a fancy neighborhood.

08:37.212 --> 08:39.083
The house is in her father's
name, Wade Henslow,

08:39.127 --> 08:40.824
CEO of Henslow
Family Furniture.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.304
- Wait, that's the guy

08:42.347 --> 08:44.088
from those late night
TV commercials, right?

08:44.132 --> 08:46.003
- Yeah,
and according to his bio,

08:46.047 --> 08:47.657
he's, like, a big holy roller.
He gives 20% of his profits

08:47.701 --> 08:49.093
to Christian charities.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.355
- Okay, so let's
dig into Charlotte.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.183
Find out everything about her.

08:52.227 --> 08:54.142
She's the daughter of one
of the richest men in Chicago.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.839
That's probably our motive.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.145
Adam, Kim.

08:57.188 --> 08:58.973
Roll with me.

09:07.416 --> 09:10.245
Wade Henslow?
- Yes?

09:10.288 --> 09:11.725
Is there something
I can help you with?

09:11.768 --> 09:14.031
- May we come in?
- Of course.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.076
- Thanks.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.121
- I can't believe it.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.690
This can't be happening.
- We've got an eyewitness,

09:20.734 --> 09:21.952
saw your daughter
being forced into a vehicle

09:21.996 --> 09:23.040
last night.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.173
- No.
No, no, no.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.870
- Has anyone called you,
made any demands?

09:26.914 --> 09:28.568
- No.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.354
- What's going on, Wade?

09:32.397 --> 09:34.878
- The police are here, honey.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.967
- Well, why?
Did something happen?

09:38.752 --> 09:40.231
Is this about Charlotte?

09:43.321 --> 09:45.759
Wade, tell me
what is happening here.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.240
- They're saying
she's been kidnapped.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.243
- Oh, my--oh, my God.
N-n--

09:52.287 --> 09:54.942
No, no, no, wait, no, no.
This isn't true.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.900
I talked to her yesterday
on the way to the mission,

09:56.944 --> 09:59.250
the clothing drive.
I'm'na call her,

09:59.294 --> 10:00.817
and I'm gonna clear
this whole thing up.

10:00.861 --> 10:01.905
She's--she's okay.
- Ma'am, ma'am.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.211
It is true.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.215
And I think your husband
knows it's true.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.219
- What are you--
what are you talking about?

10:11.262 --> 10:13.090
- When we break the news
to parents

10:13.134 --> 10:14.744
that their child's
been kidnapped,

10:14.788 --> 10:16.790
the first thing they do
almost every single time

10:16.833 --> 10:18.182
is try to contact their child,

10:18.226 --> 10:21.142
like your wife's doing
right now.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.840
You didn't reach
for your phone.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.451
I think you talked to them,

10:26.495 --> 10:28.802
and they probably warned you
not to talk to the police,

10:28.845 --> 10:29.890
and you agreed.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.282
- Wade?

10:31.326 --> 10:34.068
Is this true?

10:34.111 --> 10:35.939
Wade?

10:39.334 --> 10:40.901
- Sir, the clock is ticking.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.946
Believe me,
we are your best chance

10:42.990 --> 10:44.165
to get your daughter back.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.213
- Yes, it's true.
- Oh, my God.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
- A man called--

10:50.737 --> 10:52.347
- Sir, what were his demands?

10:52.390 --> 10:54.697
- Uh, $2 million.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.265
He texted me a video.
Charlotte is okay.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.788
She's scared, but she's okay.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.138
But the man said
that if I called the police,

11:01.182 --> 11:02.226
he was gonna kill her.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.186
- No.
No, no, no, no.

11:05.229 --> 11:06.709
No, no, no, no, Ben.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.797
They're gonna--
they're gonna kill--

11:07.841 --> 11:09.407
they're gonna kill our baby.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.378
- Mrs. Henslow?

11:23.421 --> 11:24.901
It's probably best if you leave
the room for this.

11:24.945 --> 11:26.947
- I'm not going anywhere.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.775
I'm her mother.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.212
Whatever this is,
I need to see it.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.954
- All right, so she stays.

11:35.869 --> 11:39.481
All right,
go ahead and play it.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.745
- Hello, Daddy.
Mom.

11:42.789 --> 11:46.706
I don't know what's happening.
I'm okay.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.577
But I'm scared.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.405
Please help me.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.233
Whatever they ask you to do,
you have to do it.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.496
The two men said
that they would kill me.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.411
I'm so scared.

11:56.454 --> 11:58.674
Please, Daddy,
you have to do what they say.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.849
I wanna come home.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.025
- Oh.

12:03.940 --> 12:06.769
- All right, going forward,

12:06.813 --> 12:09.598
we have to be on the same page.
That means no more secrets.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.600
- I understand.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.863
I got--I got nervous.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.735
The man I talked to
was so adamant

12:15.778 --> 12:17.737
about me not speaking
to the police, I--

12:17.780 --> 12:19.390
I didn't wanna do anything

12:19.434 --> 12:20.870
that would jeopardize
our daughter's safety.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.742
- I get it.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.352
All right, ma'am.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.921
Here, get this over
to the OCD crime lab.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.880
Look, these people--

12:30.924 --> 12:33.491
they're gonna go through
every detail, every sound,

12:33.535 --> 12:34.710
every word.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.364
They're gonna
narrow down locations.

12:36.407 --> 12:39.367
They're gonna find out
who sent this and from where.

12:39.410 --> 12:43.066
I promise you, we are doing
everything we can to find her.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.633
- Thank you.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.722
- Thank you.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.946
- It's okay.
You can take your time.

12:57.515 --> 13:00.344
You know, they tell you
to be the person

13:00.388 --> 13:01.781
that you want your kids to be.

13:04.914 --> 13:07.874
I guess I need her to be
really strong right now.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.531
Do you have kids?

13:15.098 --> 13:18.014
- No, I don't.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.712
Um,

13:20.756 --> 13:23.672
you said, uh, Charlotte
was volunteering last night?

13:23.715 --> 13:26.327
- Yes, uh, she does once a week

13:26.370 --> 13:28.459
at the Christian
Charity Mission.

13:28.503 --> 13:29.983
- Okay.

13:30.026 --> 13:33.900
- We have been so blessed
with Wade's business success.

13:33.943 --> 13:37.425
Charlotte has always
felt compelled to give back

13:37.468 --> 13:39.427
to the community.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.124
- Was she headed home after?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.997
- Um, no, she stays with
a friend who lives in the city

13:44.040 --> 13:47.130
so that she doesn't have
to come home so late.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.698
For her safety.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.875
- Could I have
contact information

13:52.919 --> 13:54.485
for that friend?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.966
- Yes, I--
I have her phone number.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.016
- I think Charlotte
sounds really lovely.

14:07.107 --> 14:11.067
- Please...
just bring her home.

14:14.679 --> 14:15.985
- Have you told anybody else
about the kidnapping?

14:16.029 --> 14:17.813
- No.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.771
- Do you have any idea
who might've taken Charlotte?

14:19.815 --> 14:21.512
- No.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.688
- You got any enemies, Wade?

14:23.732 --> 14:26.387
Not that I'm aware of.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.520
I try to lead
a clean and honest life.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.828
You know,
I don't drink or gamble.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.135
I'm a pretty boring guy.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.050
- And the drop?
- What do you mean?

14:37.093 --> 14:38.486
- The money.

14:38.529 --> 14:39.879
You said he demanded money,
yes?

14:39.922 --> 14:42.011
- Yeah, uh, I was putting
together the ransom

14:42.055 --> 14:44.013
when you guys arrived.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.972
- He give you instructions?

14:46.015 --> 14:47.669
- No.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.149
He said he would--
he would call

14:49.192 --> 14:51.107
and uh, tell me
where to leave the cash,

14:51.151 --> 14:52.935
and then he would release her.

14:52.979 --> 14:54.502
- When was this call
supposed to be?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.069
- He didn't say.
Look, I'm sorry

14:56.112 --> 14:57.722
that I don't have more answers

14:57.766 --> 14:58.941
for you guys, okay?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.638
This is all happening
really fast.

15:00.682 --> 15:01.726
- It's all right.
We're here now.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.163
We're gonna figure this out.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.167
Hey, listen, I'm gonna post
a couple of patrolmen

15:07.210 --> 15:10.126
here in the house, okay?
They'll be out of sight.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.737
We're gonna monitor
all your calls,

15:12.781 --> 15:14.435
so anyone reaches out
to you or your wife,

15:14.478 --> 15:15.827
we'll be on it.
Understand?

15:15.871 --> 15:16.959
- Good, good.
That's good.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.135
What can I do?
How else can I help?

15:19.179 --> 15:23.618
- Just sit tight, best you can,
and let us do our job.

15:23.661 --> 15:26.621
Listen, we are not going home
until we find her.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.710
- Thank you.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.581
Thank you.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.497
- We know Charlotte walked from
the mission to her friend's.

15:33.541 --> 15:34.934
Let's retrace her steps.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.805
- That was Jay.
Whoever sent the video

15:36.848 --> 15:38.981
bounced the location through
three different IP addresses.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.678
- So there's no way
to trace it?

15:40.722 --> 15:42.550
- No, but the video's
time stamped at 2:08.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.899
That's only 15 minutes
after she was abducted,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.205
so she wasn't taken far.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.684
They're narrowing the grid
right now.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.251
- Okay, good.
Coordinate with Jay.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.688
Start sweeping for locations.
We gotta move fast.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.083
- So we're working within
this five mile radius,

15:54.127 --> 15:56.781
and we're looking at red brick
warehouse structures,

15:56.825 --> 15:59.132
most likely closed down.
We sent the pictures to ISP.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.612
The salt is leaching out
of the mortar in these bricks,

16:01.656 --> 16:03.614
so the building has to be
at least a hundred years old.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.268
- Copy.

16:05.312 --> 16:07.096
Abandoned building that's
at least a hundred years old.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.924
- That narrows it down.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.621
- OCD just sent this over.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.537
- Okay, so there's, like,
a blast furnace door

16:13.581 --> 16:15.104
that has the letters B and W
on it.

16:15.148 --> 16:17.846
- I've got one 911 call
that might be a match

16:17.889 --> 16:19.979
near the intersection
of Eshem and Berkeley.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.068
That's two miles
for where Charlotte was taken.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.679
A woman reported a female
screaming for help.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.986
Beat cop responded
and there was no female,

16:27.029 --> 16:28.248
but there was a traffic camera.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.641
- Copy that.
Looking it up right now.

16:30.685 --> 16:33.993
- Bingo, that's our SUV.
We got them.

16:34.036 --> 16:35.820
- And there's our girl
trying to get away.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.170
You guys hear that?

16:37.213 --> 16:39.520
- Copy, we're at Eshem
and Berkeley facing West.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.046
- Turn right on Berkeley.
- Copy.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.579
- Three blocks, turn left
on Lyric.

16:58.843 --> 17:02.804
- Approaching Lyric now.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.066
We made the turn.
Now what?

17:11.900 --> 17:13.293
- Crap.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.121
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.992
- That means we don't know yet.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.125
- All right, bad scenario is,
we lost him somehow,

17:19.168 --> 17:21.562
good scenario,
they dipped in somewhere

17:21.605 --> 17:23.042
and we can't find them
on traffic cams

17:23.085 --> 17:24.695
because you're right on top

17:24.739 --> 17:26.741
of wherever it is
they're keeping her.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.092
- I'm checking the, uh,
Cook County Assessor's Office

17:30.136 --> 17:32.312
for all B and W businesses
in the area.

17:32.355 --> 17:37.186
B and W,
B and W...

17:37.230 --> 17:39.928
Bell and Whitney Steel,
foreclosed in 1998.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.756
That's gotta be it.
- Okay, so where is it?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.236
- It--it's right up there.

17:47.936 --> 17:50.721
We got a possible location,
2930 Wilson Avenue.

17:50.765 --> 17:51.940
We're dropping anchor.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.072
- Copy that.
We're on our way.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.209
- Just so you know,

18:00.253 --> 18:02.211
the woman at the bar told me
you were sleeping with her.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.824
- Yeah, well, we were.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.305
We are, so...

18:09.349 --> 18:10.785
- Okay.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.003
- Ruzek, almost there.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.701
ETA two minutes.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.965
Team's en route.
- Okay, let's gear up.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.837
- Thank you.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.360
- Let's move.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.418
Rojas, this is the room.
- Yeah.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.071
- We're in the room where
Charlotte was being held.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.421
It's empty.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.730
- Jay.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.299
Body.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.873
I got another one.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.442
- Sarge, I got two male DOAs
back here.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.008
Gunshot wounds.
No Charlotte.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.358
- Copy that.
I'll call it in.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.186
- What the hell happened?

19:58.893 --> 20:01.635
- Gotta confirm
with ballistics,

20:01.678 --> 20:03.463
but it appears these two
engaged in a firefight.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.942
They shot each other.
- Well, we found one kidnapper.

20:04.986 --> 20:06.640
The other's still out there
with Charlotte.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.250
We got IDs
on either of these guys?

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
- Yeah.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.471
The guy in the hood
is the same guy I followed

20:11.514 --> 20:13.342
outside of the bar.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.517
His name is Blake Larson.

20:14.561 --> 20:15.953
He's 38,
from Champaign, Illinois.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.868
- He got a sheet?
- It's clean.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.957
And the older gentleman
right here with the nine--

20:20.001 --> 20:22.830
he's an ex-cop, boss.
His name's Kenny Burroughs.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.266
He owns his own
security company.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.398
- Well, let me guess.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.747
He ran security
for Wade Henslow?

20:26.790 --> 20:28.618
- Yes, sir.
For the last ten years.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.272
- So Wade went behind our back,

20:30.316 --> 20:31.534
and hired his own security guy
to find his daughter,

20:31.578 --> 20:33.754
and it went bad.
- Real bad, I'd say.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.277
- Sarge.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.583
You know what doesn't add up?
- Huh?

20:36.626 --> 20:38.367
- We've been searching nonstop,

20:38.411 --> 20:40.630
and I think we're pretty good
at what we do.

20:40.674 --> 20:44.068
How the hell did this guy
beat us here?

20:46.593 --> 20:50.336
- We agreed, no more secrets.
- Sergeant, what is going on?

20:50.379 --> 20:52.773
- You hired your own security
guy to rescue Charlotte.

20:52.816 --> 20:56.516
- Kenny Burroughs.
I've known him for years.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.387
I trust him
more than anyone I know.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.563
- Yeah, well the problem is,
you bet on the wrong horse.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.086
Kenny's dead.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.309
- What about Charlotte?
- We're still looking.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.529
But, Wade,

21:09.572 --> 21:11.748
you gave Kenny information
you didn't give us

21:11.792 --> 21:14.708
to help him track
the kidnappers.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.537
I think you know who took
your daughter, don't you?

21:19.452 --> 21:21.062
Don't you!?

21:21.105 --> 21:23.717
- Mr. Larson.
- Just give us a name.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.372
- Okay.
Gary Stevens.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.764
His name is Gary Stevens.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.418
- Okay, who is Gary Stevens?

21:29.462 --> 21:31.377
- He's a father
of a former employee of mine,

21:31.420 --> 21:32.856
Dylan Stevens.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.337
- Okay.
All right.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.818
- He was a troubled kid, okay?

21:37.861 --> 21:39.820
He starts making up
all these stories, right?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.779
And his father
tries to blackmail me.

21:42.823 --> 21:44.999
Can you imagine?
Tries to blackmail me.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.827
The whole thing is a shakedown.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.090
He's just trying
to get money out of me.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.397
- Listen, your friend Kenny,
the ex-cop--

21:51.440 --> 21:53.529
when he went there,
he had the $2 million?

21:53.573 --> 21:54.922
- No, no, no, no.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.619
He thought it was better
to go in covertly.

21:56.663 --> 21:58.882
He said delivering the ransom
was a bad idea.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.363
- Uh-huh.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.452
- Look, I am telling you
exactly what happened.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.628
I'm telling you
everything I know.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.456
I'm just trying
to get my daughter back.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.940
- Okay, we got anything?

22:12.983 --> 22:14.985
- So Gary Stevens
from Champaign, Illinois.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.639
55 years old,

22:16.683 --> 22:18.380
worked in construction
up until a couple years ago.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.513
He got hurt on the job.
Workman's comp got denied.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.471
Two liens on his house.
Yeah.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.820
Now get this.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.040
Uh, Blake Larson,
our dead hoodie,

22:26.083 --> 22:27.911
is Gary's cousin.
Blake worked in IT.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.870
He got laid off
a couple months ago.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.829
- So they're broke,
they try to blackmail Wade,

22:32.873 --> 22:34.875
it doesn't work,
and they kidnap his daughter?

22:34.918 --> 22:36.398
I mean, it's possible.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.617
- All right,
what about Gary's son?

22:37.660 --> 22:38.661
What's his story?

22:38.705 --> 22:41.447
- Dylan Stevens, 24 years old.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.623
He did work for Wade's company
for about two years.

22:43.666 --> 22:44.841
- He also has
one prior misdemeanor

22:44.885 --> 22:46.582
for drug possession,

22:46.626 --> 22:49.150
and he spent three months
in a mental health facility.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.935
- Okay, well, where is he now?
- He's actually missing.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.415
He's been gone for two weeks.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.461
His father filed
a missing person report.

22:55.504 --> 22:58.420
Detective Parker out of
Area North handled the paper.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.466
- Okay, you two contact Parker.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.076
Get him down to unit.
Find out what he knows.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.947
- On it.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.689
- Dylan Stevens
was a grown-ass man

23:06.733 --> 23:08.561
with a history
of drugs and mental illness.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.519
- So you never looked
into the disappearance.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.173
- I'm not saying that at all.
We dug into it,

23:12.216 --> 23:13.740
but there really wasn't
much we could do.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.481
That kid could've
been anywhere.

23:15.524 --> 23:17.178
- Okay, what did his father
say when he called?

23:18.179 --> 23:20.007
- He said that, uh,
he thought his son Dylan

23:20.050 --> 23:22.531
was having an affair
with a Wade Henslow.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.141
You know, that dude
from the furniture commercials?

23:24.185 --> 23:26.056
And he was convinced

23:26.100 --> 23:28.450
that Wade had something to do
with his son's disappearance.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.104
Now, I asked for proof,
evidence.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.106
The father
didn't really have any.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.891
The only thing he said was that
Dylan was supposed to come home

23:34.935 --> 23:36.763
for his dad's birthday.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.852
They had a big dinner planned
that was, uh,

23:38.895 --> 23:40.593
ch-ch-ch,
two weeks ago.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.725
He said that, uh,
Dylan called around 10:00 a.m.,

23:42.769 --> 23:44.901
Said he had a meeting
with Wade Henslow that day.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.250
He was gonna be
a little bit late.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.730
And that was it.

23:47.774 --> 23:49.079
Never saw his son again
after that.

23:49.123 --> 23:51.125
- You talked to Wade Henslow?
- I did.

23:51.168 --> 23:53.562
Said he hadn't seen Dylan
in a few months.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.869
No idea why the father
would say what he said.

23:55.912 --> 23:57.610
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.176
He said the father showed up
at his house a few times,

23:59.220 --> 24:00.917
made a few threats.

24:00.961 --> 24:02.745
I asked Henslow if he wanted
to file a restraining order,

24:02.789 --> 24:05.487
but he refused.
Said he had his own security.

24:05.531 --> 24:06.967
- Why didn't you
go hard on Henslow?

24:07.010 --> 24:08.055
- 'Cause he seemed credible.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.622
The father, Gary Stevens--

24:09.665 --> 24:10.753
now, he's the one
that seemed unhinged.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.625
And like I said,

24:12.668 --> 24:15.454
the son had a history of
drug abuse and mental illness.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.588
- Detective Parker said
that Gary Steven's son, Dylan,

24:19.632 --> 24:21.068
went missing March 28th.

24:21.111 --> 24:24.245
We ran tollbooths, red light
cameras, parking meters,

24:24.288 --> 24:25.942
I mean, the works,
and we found something.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.075
- We got a hit
on Wade Henslow's Range Rover

24:28.118 --> 24:29.946
over at a parking meter
on Catalpa Avenue.

24:29.990 --> 24:33.167
We pulled surveillance
from a nearby auto parts shop.

24:35.996 --> 24:38.520
- Good work.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.789
You wanna explain this?

24:49.139 --> 24:50.967
That's the same day

24:51.011 --> 24:53.666
you told Detective Parker
that you didn't see the kid.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.058
- It's not what it looks like.

24:55.102 --> 24:58.714
- I'm looking at a picture.
I know what I see.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.237
- It was just a hug.
That's all it was.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.805
- Wade.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.894
You don't stop lying,
your daughter's gonna die.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.548
- Sergeant, I'm not lying.

25:06.592 --> 25:09.290
- You were in a relationship
with Dylan Stevens, yes?

25:09.333 --> 25:11.248
- Yes, but not that kind
of relationship.

25:11.292 --> 25:13.990
- Okay, what kind
of relationship was it?

25:14.034 --> 25:16.558
-  I knew Dylan
from one of my stores.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.605
He seemed like a good kid,
but he had a lot of issues

25:19.648 --> 25:21.868
with drugs and mental illness.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.652
His life was falling apart,

25:23.696 --> 25:26.002
and he was threatening
to commit suicide,

25:26.046 --> 25:27.613
so I tried to help him.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.049
I tried to give him
a little bit of hope.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.833
- Sarge?
We got something.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.884
- You're not going anywhere.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.149
- Patrol drove
by Dylan Stevens' last known.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.193
The Silver Isuzu
from the kidnapping

25:43.237 --> 25:44.934
is parked right outside.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.806
- Good, tell them hold tight,
we're on our way.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.024
- You got it.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.738
- 10-1, 10-1.
Shots fired at the police,

26:05.781 --> 26:07.870
and we're pinned down
at 51 Whitecrest.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.872
I repeat, 51 Whitecrest.
- I got Charlotte!

26:09.916 --> 26:12.092
Make any move to come inside,
and I will kill her!

26:12.135 --> 26:15.617
- D-21 Squad, advise
third district commander.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
I need
every available patrolman.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.404
We got a hostage
barricade situation.

26:31.198 --> 26:32.634
- Thank you.
- You good?

26:32.678 --> 26:35.289
- Oh, yeah.

26:37.291 --> 26:38.597
- His position's looking down

26:38.640 --> 26:40.294
on the only entrance.
We can't breach.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.252
- All right, grab a long gun.
Get an elevated position.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.602
On my order.
- Copy that.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.734
- We got a cell phone number
for Gary Stevens.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.388
- Okay, good.
- Line's open.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.477
- Hi, Gary.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.784
This is Sergeant Hank Voight.

26:51.827 --> 26:54.917
First thing, I need to know
that Charlotte's okay.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.224
- The girl is fine.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.791
- I need proof.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.359
- I'm okay.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.274
- All right,
that's a real good start, Gary.

27:04.318 --> 27:08.191
Listen,
the best way out of this

27:08.235 --> 27:10.890
is for you to just release
Charlotte unharmed.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.892
You do that,
I can guarantee your safety.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.416
- No,
not until I get what I want.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.461
- Okay, let's talk about that.

27:17.505 --> 27:20.203
Now, Wade Henslow said you
demanded $2 million.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.510
- He's a liar.
I never said I wanted money.

27:24.730 --> 27:28.211
- Okay, well, let's talk
about what you do want, Gary.

27:28.255 --> 27:29.735
- Bring Wade here.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.562
He has to tell me
what he did to my son.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.652
If not,
I will kill his daughter.

27:35.523 --> 27:38.657
- All right, Gary,
I understand you got a beef.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.484
But you gotta understand

27:40.528 --> 27:42.356
Charlotte's got nothing
to do with this.

27:42.399 --> 27:45.185
I mean, she's an innocent.
- You got one hour.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.231
- Get Wade Henslow.
- Uh-huh.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.711
- Drag his ass here now.

28:11.385 --> 28:13.430
Jay, you got a visual?

28:13.474 --> 28:15.215
- I'm locked on the window.
No target.

28:15.258 --> 28:16.825
- You get a shot, you take it.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.348
- Sergeant, what's happening?
How's my daughter?

28:18.392 --> 28:19.698
Is she okay?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.961
- Gary Stevens says
he never demanded money.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.354
- Of course he did.
- He thinks you hurt his son.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.530
He says
if you don't come clean,

28:26.574 --> 28:28.228
he's gonna kill your daughter.

28:28.271 --> 28:29.620
- That's insane, Sergeant.

28:29.664 --> 28:31.274
He's just saying things
to make you--

28:31.318 --> 28:33.450
what's the plan?
Can you take him out?

28:33.494 --> 28:35.452
- It's too risky.
- So what's your play?

28:35.496 --> 28:36.932
- The play is for you to
tell us what actually happened.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.760
What the hell
is he talking about?

28:38.804 --> 28:40.893
- What happened is there's
a deranged man in that room

28:40.936 --> 28:42.590
with a gun
to my daughter's head.

28:42.633 --> 28:44.287
What more do you guys
need to know?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.379
- Go ahead, Gary.
I'm listening.

28:49.423 --> 28:51.425
- What the hell is going on?

28:51.468 --> 28:52.774
- Listen,
we're making progress.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.689
I've got Wade Henslow
right here.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.430
- I don't believe you.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.040
- I'm here, Gary.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.260
I'll pay you whatever you want.
Just let my daughter go.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.305
- You know I don't want money,
Wade.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.872
Just tell me
and these policemen

29:03.916 --> 29:06.570
what happened to my son!
- I don't know.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.747
He was fine the last time
I saw him, I swear.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.053
- You think you can
just keep jerking me around?

29:11.097 --> 29:12.838
- I'm not.
I swear to God.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.622
- Look up here, Wade!
You think I'm joking?

29:15.666 --> 29:17.756
You want your daughter to die?
- No, please don't.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.758
- Gary, put the gun down.
- Where's my son?

29:19.801 --> 29:21.803
- Put the gun down.
- I don't know!

29:21.847 --> 29:22.891
- So help me, God, Wade,
I will kill her.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.893
- Charlotte!

29:24.937 --> 29:26.677
He's lying--he's lying to you.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.071
He's lying!
- Is he?

29:29.115 --> 29:31.595
'Cause you been lying to me
all along.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.467
Now were you sleeping
with his son?

29:33.510 --> 29:35.512
Were you!?

29:35.556 --> 29:36.905
And you killed him
because you were afraid

29:36.949 --> 29:38.777
he was gonna tell the world
you're gay?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.822
- I'm tired of waiting.
You got ten seconds, Wade.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.345
- Ruzek, go now!

29:42.389 --> 29:44.086
- You with me!
- Move!

29:44.130 --> 29:46.872
I swear to God.
- Seven, six, five...

29:46.915 --> 29:49.309
- You let your daughter die,
I will kill you myself.

29:49.352 --> 29:50.919
- Four, three, two...
- I didn't do anything.

29:52.616 --> 29:55.489
- Everybody stand down!

29:55.532 --> 29:57.926
Stand down!
Jay, was that you?

29:57.970 --> 29:59.798
- I got a partial.
I took the only shot I had.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.843
- Breach!
Breach now!

30:01.887 --> 30:04.019
- Crossing.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.630
Grab that ram, Nina.

30:06.674 --> 30:07.806
Grab that ram.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.808
- Got it.
- You ready?

30:17.380 --> 30:19.513
Hit it.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.516
Yeah.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.829
- Hold here.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.715
- Take one more step,
and I will kill her!

30:47.758 --> 30:49.412
- No, you will not.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.631
Gary, there's another way
out of this, all right?

30:50.674 --> 30:51.675
Just stay calm.

30:51.719 --> 30:53.068
Keep everybody back, okay?

30:53.112 --> 30:54.374
- Copy.
I gotcha.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.637
- All right, Gary,

30:56.680 --> 30:58.030
everybody's gonna stay back,

30:58.073 --> 30:59.596
but I gotta come in there,
you understand?

30:59.640 --> 31:01.860
- Stay out!
- Gary.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.513
If you want us to meet
your demands,

31:03.557 --> 31:04.775
I gotta confirm
that Charlotte's okay

31:04.819 --> 31:06.995
which means
I gotta come in there.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.910
Okay?

31:10.956 --> 31:13.088
All right, I'm gonna move in.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.569
All right,
I don't wanna hurt you.

31:15.612 --> 31:18.180
Okay, you see my hand?

31:18.224 --> 31:20.617
Nice and easy.

31:20.661 --> 31:22.750
- Put the gun down!
- I'm not putting my gun down.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.186
I don't put my gun down
until you put your gun down.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.884
That's how this works.
Just take it easy.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.886
- I need to find my son!

31:27.929 --> 31:30.540
- I know you do.
Of course you do.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.020
You're a good dad.
You love your kid.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.717
And that's part of the reason
why we're here.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.937
We wanna help you find
your boy, all right?

31:35.981 --> 31:37.808
But we can't do it
under these circumstances.

31:37.852 --> 31:38.897
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

31:38.940 --> 31:40.159
You gotta put the gun down.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.074
- Not until I find answers!

31:42.117 --> 31:44.554
- Charlotte--Gary,
he's not gonna hurt you.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.861
Are you, Gary?
You're not gonna hurt her.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.036
You're not gonna hurt this girl

31:48.080 --> 31:49.081
who's got nothing
to do with this,

31:49.124 --> 31:50.560
who's done nothing to you.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.910
She's got nothing
to do with it.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.824
She's just a kid.

31:53.868 --> 31:55.652
About the same age as your boy.

31:55.696 --> 31:58.090
Right?

31:58.133 --> 31:59.918
Right?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.832
It's all right.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.008
Gary.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.882
Put the gun down.
You need a doctor, man.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.753
You need a doctor, Gary.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.581
- Stay back!
- Okay, okay.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.192
All right, all right.
- You good, Ruz?

32:13.235 --> 32:15.629
- We're good!
We're good.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.675
We're gonna do this your way.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.112
I'm gonna open a line
of communication to my team,

32:20.155 --> 32:22.201
and together,
we're all gonna find your son.

32:23.115 --> 32:24.551
Okay?

32:24.594 --> 32:25.944
- If this is a trick,
I will kill her.

32:25.987 --> 32:29.077
- It is not a trick.

32:29.121 --> 32:32.602
I'm'na sit right here with you.
Nobody else is coming in.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.953
Okay?

32:36.606 --> 32:39.870
Sarge, I'm sitting here
with Gary and Charlotte.

32:39.914 --> 32:41.742
Charlotte's okay.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.700
Gary's refusing
medical attention,

32:43.744 --> 32:45.615
and the three of us are gonna
sit tight right here

32:45.659 --> 32:47.574
until we figure
this thing out.

32:47.617 --> 32:48.923
- Sarge, what's the order?
Am I clear

32:48.967 --> 32:51.012
if I get another shot?

32:51.056 --> 32:53.014
- Everybody stay in
your position, hold your fire.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.711
Nobody has a green light.

32:58.237 --> 33:00.152
- Sarge, we got something.
- Okay.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.719
- We were finally able to pull
the GPS from Wade's Range Rover

33:02.763 --> 33:04.895
on the day that Dylan
disappeared, March 27th.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.506
- Where was he going?

33:06.549 --> 33:07.942
- After Wade met Dylan,
he went home,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.639
but the car idled at Baker Park
for 30 minutes.

33:09.683 --> 33:11.815
- Yeah, I got a photo
from an intersection

33:11.859 --> 33:13.687
by the park as he's leaving.

33:13.730 --> 33:15.950
That's Dylan's coat, and it
looks like he's slumped over.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.517
- All right,
head over to Wade's house.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.127
Find that Range Rover.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.521
Have an evidence tech
and a K-9 unit meet you there.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.659
- This is a setup.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.924
You're stringing me along.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.057
- No, we're working with you.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.059
All right, give me
some more information.

33:38.103 --> 33:39.974
Tell me more about the day
that Dylan disappeared.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.847
- I already went to the cops.
They didn't do a damn thing.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.719
- They might've
missed something.

33:45.762 --> 33:49.070
What about the, uh, last
phone call you had with Dylan?

33:49.114 --> 33:50.811
It was on your birthday, yeah?

33:50.854 --> 33:53.727
You hear anything
on the other end of the line?

33:53.770 --> 33:55.207
A plane, a train,
an automobile?

33:55.250 --> 33:57.035
Anything specific like that?

33:58.210 --> 34:00.038
- No.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.867
But I was worried.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.653
- Why?

34:08.263 --> 34:11.136
- Dylan told me
he was gonna confront Wade

34:11.179 --> 34:14.617
about his lies.
- What lies were those?

34:14.661 --> 34:17.881
- Wade kept promising
he was gonna leave his family

34:17.925 --> 34:20.101
so he and Dylan
could finally be together.

34:23.757 --> 34:27.282
I think Wade killed my son

34:27.326 --> 34:29.763
so his family
would never have to know.

34:34.028 --> 34:37.075
You have no idea who your
father really is, do you?

34:37.118 --> 34:38.815
- Gary, just talk to me, okay?

34:39.642 --> 34:41.601
Talk to me.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.081
This is all good stuff.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.734
We're gonna look into this,
okay?

34:44.778 --> 34:46.910
Just give us
a little more time.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.304
- We're not going anywhere.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.308
- I know.

35:07.322 --> 35:09.368
- Mrs. Henslow?

35:09.411 --> 35:10.760
We're looking for
your husband's Range Rover.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.458
- Did you find Charlotte?
- She's alive.

35:12.501 --> 35:13.894
I need permission to search
that car right now.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.156
- Why aren't you trying
to save my daughter?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.636
- We are.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.420
Your husband is the reason
your daughter was kidnapped.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.248
He was having an affair
with the kidnapper's son.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.858
- What?
That's crazy.

35:21.902 --> 35:23.251
- I know it's crazy,
but it's true.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.861
- No, he's not like that.

35:24.905 --> 35:26.776
- These are surveillance photos
taken from two weeks ago.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.517
Your husband
was the last person seen

35:28.561 --> 35:30.171
with this young man.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.781
- So...

35:31.825 --> 35:33.479
- We tracked his movements.
He came back here.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.350
- This can't be--

35:35.394 --> 35:37.222
- We don't have time for this,
Mrs. Henslow.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.832
Help me save your daughter
and take me to that damn car.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.446
Anything?

35:44.490 --> 35:46.405
- Burgess!
- Yeah?

35:46.448 --> 35:48.885
- Somebody tried to clean this
out, but they missed something.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.583
- Blood.
- That's right.

35:50.626 --> 35:51.932
- Oh, my God.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.499
- Hey, hey, hey.
No, no, no.

35:53.542 --> 35:54.674
What happened here?
Tell me what happened here.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.197
You helped your husband?
- No.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.807
- Are you sure?

35:57.851 --> 35:59.548
- No, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.202
- Okay, Laura, I believe you,
but now I need you to think.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.595
I need you to think
really hard.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.466
March 28th was two weeks ago.
It was a Saturday.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.294
Do you remember anything
out of the ordinary?

36:06.338 --> 36:08.688
- No, I was out with Charlotte.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.212
We always have lunch together
on Saturday afternoons.

36:11.256 --> 36:12.213
- Okay, what about
when you came home?

36:12.257 --> 36:13.258
Where was your husband?

36:13.301 --> 36:14.650
- He was here.
He was--

36:14.694 --> 36:15.651
- What?

36:15.695 --> 36:17.349
Laura, that's it.
What?

36:17.392 --> 36:19.612
Come on.
- He was in the woods.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.875
Behind the yard.

36:21.918 --> 36:24.225
When he came in,
he had mud on his clothes.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.531
It didn't make any sense.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.315
- Rojas, get the dogs.
Watch her.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.638
- Gary.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.730
Gary, we're making progress.

36:50.773 --> 36:53.428
We got a bunch of people
out looking.

36:53.472 --> 36:55.256
But listen to me, man.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.910
Right now, we need to get you
some medical attention.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.607
- No.

37:00.740 --> 37:02.698
Not until I find my son.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.657
- Yeah, you're not gonna
make it that far.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.267
- I don't care.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.705
I want my son.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.056
- Okay.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.710
Okay.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.539
- The dogs sniffed out a spot
back here.

37:18.845 --> 37:20.325
It's a body.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.939
- Sarge, we found Dylan.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.793
- Come on.

37:53.836 --> 37:54.924
Partner's right outside
the door.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.058
- All right.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.321
Kev, Charlotte's coming out.

38:00.365 --> 38:02.018
- Roger.
Got you.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.763
- Gary.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.463
Gary.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.424
- Hmm?

38:16.468 --> 38:18.600
- We found your boy.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.401
Sorry.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.331
- Charlotte.
Sweetheart...

38:54.854 --> 38:56.725
Honey, I'm so glad you're safe.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.510
- Man, you got lucky.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.990
He was gonna put a bullet
in your daughter's head

39:01.034 --> 39:03.732
'cause you don't have the guts
to cop to who you really are.

39:04.690 --> 39:06.866
- You don't understand.

39:06.909 --> 39:08.998
- Get this piece of garbage
out of my sight.

39:09.042 --> 39:10.348
Book him for murder.

39:19.226 --> 39:21.446
Oh, my God.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.013
- Yep, hell of a day.
- Yeah.

39:34.850 --> 39:36.939
What do you think?
You wanna get some dinner?

39:36.983 --> 39:38.158
- No.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.594
Adam, you don't have
to do that.

39:39.638 --> 39:40.726
It's o--it's okay.
- No, no, no, no.

39:40.769 --> 39:41.727
I wanna do that.
- It's okay.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.119
- I'd like to.
Please?

39:43.163 --> 39:46.166
- Adam.
- I gotta tell you,

39:46.209 --> 39:49.778
I've been trying to have some
fun, get my mind off of things,

39:49.822 --> 39:51.519
but I...

39:51.563 --> 39:53.521
cannot seem to do that.

39:54.914 --> 39:56.916
Everything I think
is gonna make me happy

39:56.959 --> 40:00.049
ends up just kinda
making me sad, you know?

40:00.093 --> 40:01.964
- Yeah.

40:02.008 --> 40:05.533
- But I think that going
to dinner with you--

40:05.577 --> 40:08.971
that'd make me smile.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.718
Yeah.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.764
Yeah,
that'll make me smile too.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.115
- Okay then.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.209
- New place in Old Town?

40:29.252 --> 40:31.951
Yeah.
