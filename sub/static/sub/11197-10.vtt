00:24.440 --> 00:26.000
Calm yourself, Commander.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.520
We are about to meet an alien race
in person for the first time.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.160
lf you are correct they are advanced
and capable of being a threat.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.440
That gives me reason to be on the alert.

00:35.560 --> 00:38.760
Since the discovery of the ruins
we have had reason to believe

00:38.840 --> 00:43.680
that there are other inhabited planets
in the galaxy, and now we have our proof.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.960
l am relieved that the very
first contact that we have made

00:47.080 --> 00:49.840
is with a race of humans
that seem to be very like us.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.640
Maybe you trust them
without suspicion. l cannot.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.760
Nevertheless, Commander,
we must proceed.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.760
They are sending their most
respected team of representatives.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.000
No doubt the leader of this group
will be a brilliant and savvy negotiator.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.640
We must be at our best
to match the challenge.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.920
Personally, l cannot wait
to meet a man of such genius.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.280
Howdy, folks.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.320
- Nice.
- Thank you, Colonel.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.040
We would be happy to take you
on a tour of our city,

01:49.160 --> 01:53.440
but first we'd like to spend a little
time talking about our mutual interests,

01:53.520 --> 01:56.080
so please, please, sit.

01:59.600 --> 02:03.040
To be honest, we are still trying
to adjust to the fact

02:03.160 --> 02:06.240
that our Stargate, as you call it,

02:06.360 --> 02:09.840
is no longer a mere relic of a bygone era.

02:09.919 --> 02:13.440
lt was a shock when your communication
machine appeared last month.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.840
First contact can be unnerving.

02:15.960 --> 02:19.840
We are all very pleased to finally
get the chance to talk face to face.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.480
From our study of the temple
we were able to deduce

02:22.560 --> 02:25.880
the Stargate was an interplanetary
transportation device.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.320
We haven't determined
how to make a connection

02:28.440 --> 02:31.520
with the many worlds described
in the writings in the temple.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.320
lt took us a while to get the hang of it, too.

02:34.440 --> 02:36.880
We know the symbols
on the Stargate are the key,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.680
but as for the number sequence
to enter in the dialling device...

02:40.800 --> 02:43.760
We can definitely help you out there.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.240
Once we get to know you a little better.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.160
Oh, yes, well, of course.

02:50.240 --> 02:55.080
We intend to allow you full access
to our citizens, our history, our culture,

02:55.200 --> 02:57.280
so that you may come to trust us.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.000
l hope we can reciprocate.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.800
We also want to make it clear that we
intend to offer all that we can in trade

03:04.880 --> 03:08.720
for any knowledge or technology
that you are willing to share.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.480
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?
- We call it tretonin, Colonel.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.880
- lt is our greatest scientific discovery.
- How so?

03:27.560 --> 03:32.400
Major Carter, from what you
have told me about your world,

03:32.520 --> 03:37.360
your people suffer from a myriad of
illnesses. Many of them are untreatable.

03:37.440 --> 03:42.400
Tretonin makes our immune systems
impervious to any ailment.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.000
We live in perfect health.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.320
What is it you hope to achieve here?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.720
lf we're gonna learn about these
people, start at the beginning.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.920
(woman) Earthans.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.720
Uh, Earthlings... sort of.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.840
l am Zenna Valk, supervisor
of the temple research project.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.840
lt is a pleasure to meet
the explorers from Earth.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.080
We're not originally from there.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.560
However, we have dedicated
ourselves to the cause of the Tauri.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.600
Earth.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.400
Am l at least correct
in assuming you are Jaffa?

05:30.480 --> 05:34.000
- lndeed.
- l cannot tell you how exciting this is.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.080
We have learned much from this site,

05:36.160 --> 05:39.520
but it must pale in comparison
to what you can teach us.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.320
l don't know, but we'd love it
if you showed us around.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.200
By all means. That was my intention.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.000
We first discovered these ruins
over 100 years ago, and since then

05:50.080 --> 05:54.720
we've dedicated ourselves to studying
the secrets the Goa'uld left behind.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.920
This area was obviously
some sort of reception colonnade

05:58.000 --> 06:01.600
for greeting travellers
who came through the Stargate.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.720
The real discovery
was made just over here.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.600
Although we fully admit tretonin
is not without side effects,

06:09.680 --> 06:14.680
we assure you, the good it can do
far outweighs any negative aspects.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.800
What kind of side effects?

06:16.880 --> 06:20.560
Depends on the individual. Most people
experience almost no reaction.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.920
Those who do merely require
more regulated doses.

06:24.040 --> 06:28.320
- We'll need a decent amount for testing.
- On Earth, of course.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.160
Yes, certainly.

06:30.280 --> 06:34.400
Of course, we need something in return
from you, as a measure of good faith.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.280
We can give you these ten addresses
and a lesson in gate technology.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.080
These are peaceful worlds,
safe from hostile forces,

06:42.200 --> 06:45.040
rich with historical relics
and natural resources.

06:45.120 --> 06:48.320
Well, this is a very generous offer,
Major, very generous.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.680
However, based on our studies
of the writings in the temple,

06:51.800 --> 06:56.480
we have compiled a list of the names
of the worlds that we would like to visit.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.920
Do you recognise any?

07:04.040 --> 07:07.600
l'll have to cross-reference
the Goa'uld names with our database,

07:07.720 --> 07:10.880
but offhand, l recognise these three, sir.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.800
They're classified off limits,
Goa'uld home worlds.

07:14.880 --> 07:16.800
Yeah, uh... fellas,

07:16.920 --> 07:20.960
you really don't wanna go here.
lt's not exactly a walk in the park.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.480
We know the Goa'uld are a hostile race
that once ruled this planet centuries ago.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.560
You're new, so l'll cut you a break...

07:28.680 --> 07:30.880
Those are the worlds we wish to explore.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.600
We believe that they are
significant to our history.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.920
Guys, we're not lying to you about this.
You don't wanna go there first time out.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.760
lf you have been to these worlds
and survived, can we not?

07:45.120 --> 07:49.360
All l'm trying to say to you
is it would be stupid.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.360
We are aware of the risks and believe
the rewards are worth the consequences,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.320
as you and your people
obviously do, Colonel.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.920
Please, Colonel,
in exchange for the tretonin,

08:00.040 --> 08:03.640
we are simply asking
that you respect our wishes.

08:12.120 --> 08:16.080
There is an underground tunnel system
that leads to the main temple.

08:16.200 --> 08:20.320
lt is most likely a means of escape
to the Stargate in case of attack.

08:20.440 --> 08:23.200
That's exactly what l thought. Please.

08:29.000 --> 08:34.480
The writing in this chamber seems to tell
the story of the Goa'uld who ruled here.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.360
We've been attempting to decipher
this section of the wall for months,

08:41.480 --> 08:43.760
thus far with limited success.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.200
lt is written in a rare dialect
of ancient Goa'uld.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.400
An account of the warlord Shak'ran.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.960
He was a System Lord who was defeated
by Apophis about 300 years ago.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.560
lndeed.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.440
Until his defeat, it appears Pangar
served as Shak'ran's home world.

09:00.560 --> 09:05.560
And what of the Goa'uld Apophis,
the one who conquered Shak'ran?

09:05.680 --> 09:08.400
He was killed in battle not long ago.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.000
As l suspected, you have
much wisdom to share.

09:12.680 --> 09:17.760
Teal'c and l will help with the translations.
l've got a dozen ancient ciphers l can try.

09:17.840 --> 09:22.960
Please, l do not wish to be overheard
by the Pangar security contingent.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.840
There is something you need
to know about the tretonin.

09:27.960 --> 09:32.720
Please, come with me and l will finish
showing you the rest of the ruins.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.920
l will try to talk to you later.

09:49.800 --> 09:53.080
She said there was something
we needed to know about tretonin.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.520
She seemed to be worried
about these guys,

09:55.640 --> 10:00.200
like she was going out on a limb talking
about something other than hieroglyphs.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.880
(O'Neill) Keep digging.
See what you can find.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.360
Carter and l will take this
sample back to the SGC.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.640
(footsteps)

10:21.760 --> 10:24.160
- Jonas.
- Dr Valk.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.280
- Please, call me Zenna.
- How's it coming?

10:27.920 --> 10:31.600
lt's slow and painstaking. Any
help you're willing to give me...

10:31.680 --> 10:35.600
Certainly. l brought those
ciphers l was telling you about.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.360
Looks like we're alone.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.880
What do you suppose this means?

10:44.960 --> 10:49.600
You said that there was something
we needed to know about the tretonin.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.280
l'm sorry. You must have misunderstood.

10:55.160 --> 10:58.080
No, l think you were pretty clear.

10:59.200 --> 11:04.240
No one's coming. Teal'c is up there
standing guard. You can talk to me.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.360
- l don't have anything to say.
- Hey, Zenna.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.160
- lf you know something...
- No, l don't.

11:23.280 --> 11:27.200
- That was strange.
- What did Zenna Valk have to say?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.280
Nothing.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.160
Someone must have gotten to her.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.760
(man) Right away.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.800
l think l got something. She's on tretonin.

12:49.880 --> 12:53.600
- lt looks like she has regular injections.
- Continue.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.120
l was thinking we go and check out
the place they get their shots.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.400
l found a map of the city.
l'm pretty sure l can get us there.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.480
Let's do it.

13:40.200 --> 13:45.360
Looks like this is where they actually
make the drug, as well as administer it.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.520
This way.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.040
(Jonas) What is it?

13:57.160 --> 13:59.760
(Teal'c) l am not sure.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.440
(Jonas) Well, something tells me
this isn't the rec room.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.160
(Teal'c) No, it is not.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.760
- There's something living in there.
- Goa'uld symbiotes.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.240
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.120
And there are a great many.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.360
What are they doing?

14:39.440 --> 14:42.720
Who's there? ldentify yourselves.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.960
(alarm)

14:47.720 --> 14:49.920
Stop

14:55.800 --> 14:57.840
Teal'c

15:02.120 --> 15:03.680
(hissing)

15:39.560 --> 15:42.000
- He's got one in him.
- Stand aside.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
Lower your weapon

15:46.160 --> 15:50.560
- This man is a Goa'uld.
- Teal'c, something's not right.

15:50.640 --> 15:54.800
- This guy's completely out of it.
- (man) Lower your weapon now

16:09.360 --> 16:12.240
Care to say why you were
at the tretonin facility?

16:12.360 --> 16:15.880
You wanna tell us why you have
a pool full of Goa'uld symbiotes?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.440
- You've betrayed our openness with you.
- Openness?

16:19.560 --> 16:22.240
You're raising Goa'ulds.
When were you gonna tell us?

16:22.360 --> 16:25.520
The symbiotes are a critical
component to making tretonin.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.960
Excuse me?

16:27.080 --> 16:31.280
lt is a complicated process, one which
is better explained by our scientists.

16:31.360 --> 16:35.280
Frankly, we intended to tell you how
the tretonin was made, eventually.

16:35.400 --> 16:39.080
We just wanted to first assess
how you might react.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.240
- Not well.
- l don't know why you're taking offence.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.640
You've told us. The Goa'uld are enemies
who have enslaved countless humans.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.800
Where is the harm in using them
to enhance our quality of life?

16:50.880 --> 16:53.160
Do you really understand the risks?

16:53.280 --> 16:57.120
We have used the same method
to produce tretonin for nearly 30 years.

16:57.200 --> 17:02.000
- We take every precaution possible.
- How were these symbiotes procured?

17:02.080 --> 17:07.119
For people who haven't mastered gate
travel, you've sure got a lot of them.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.760
We require answers before sharing
any further information.

17:10.880 --> 17:14.720
We have already told you
everything that is necessary.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.319
Tegar, the colonel is right.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.839
There is no reason to keep more secrets.

17:23.359 --> 17:27.359
The drug was developed and is now
manufactured and administered here.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.720
And since its use has spread
to more of the general population,

17:30.840 --> 17:34.240
we've implemented treatment
centres throughout Pangar.

17:34.320 --> 17:39.760
Through here is the reason we were able
to create tretonin in the first place.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.440
The symbiotes were not
procured through gate travel.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.920
Our symbiotes are all bred
here, in captivity.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.120
(Teal'c) A queen.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.760
No kidding.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.200
ls there nothing you can do to help him?

18:13.320 --> 18:17.000
- What's his condition?
- His lower-brain functions seem intact,

18:17.120 --> 18:21.680
his breathing and heart rate are normal,
but he is unresponsive to any stimulus.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.320
lt doesn't make sense.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.640
Teal'c?

18:26.760 --> 18:30.440
Prior to the process of incubating
Goa'uld symbiotes using Jaffa,

18:30.520 --> 18:34.880
the blending between Goa'uld and host
had only a one-in-two chance of success.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.680
Jaffa were created to improve the ability
of the symbiote to take human hosts.

18:39.760 --> 18:44.680
The fact that this symbiote was raised in
a tank could explain the comalike state?

18:44.800 --> 18:48.240
To the best of my knowledge,
a failed blending results in death

18:48.320 --> 18:51.280
to both Goa'uld and host.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.080
This man is very much alive.

18:55.240 --> 19:00.880
Our understanding is that this is a typical
reaction to contact with Goa'uld offspring.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.120
A Goa'uld offspring is born with the
intellect and knowledge of its queen.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.360
Normally the personality emerges,

19:07.440 --> 19:11.760
allowing the symbiote to control
the host immediately upon blending.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.880
Glowing eyes, cliché behaviour, evilness.

19:14.960 --> 19:18.680
- That kind of thing.
- This one's more of a blank slate.

19:18.800 --> 19:24.160
ls it possible that the production process
hinders the development of the symbiote?

19:24.240 --> 19:26.000
l do not know.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.880
(Carter) l recommend
we contact the Tok'ra.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.760
They may understand this condition. They
might be able to take the symbiote out.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.680
Uh, l'm sorry, who are the Tok'ra?

19:36.800 --> 19:41.520
An offshoot of the Goa'uld who oppose
them philosophically in every way.

19:41.640 --> 19:45.320
You propose to bring these Goa'uld here?

19:45.440 --> 19:50.240
They're different. They coexist with their
hosts in a truer symbiotic relationship.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.440
They are, in fact, allies.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.280
- And they can help?
- We'll see.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.000
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:07.400 --> 20:13.360
l have an admission. You know Teal'c
and l tracked down the tretonin facility.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.280
Yes, l heard.

20:15.360 --> 20:16.920
Yeah.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.040
Well, l did it by going through
your stuff when you weren't here.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.480
- l was wrong.
- l know.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.880
- You know it was wrong or...
- l know what you did. l saw you.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.760
Really? Cos l thought that we were...

20:30.160 --> 20:32.720
- Not so good.
- No?

20:33.800 --> 20:36.880
- But you didn't try and stop us.
- No. l wanted you to know.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.200
ln some ways, l'm glad
you did what you did.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.960
ln others, l'm disappointed
you were so willing to betray me.

20:44.240 --> 20:48.240
Well, no, l never would have done this
had you not come to me first.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.800
l should have told you
outright. l was afraid.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.240
Tretonin is not available
to everyone in Pangar yet.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.080
Taking it is a privilege,
one that can be revoked.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.480
- l hope l didn't get you in trouble.
- No.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.000
But our relationship,
our peoples' relationship,

21:08.720 --> 21:11.200
if we ever are to trust each other...

21:12.760 --> 21:15.760
we're not off to a very good start.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.120
l know.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.720
You could make it up to me.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.200
- How?
- Help me finish the translations.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.880
lt is as though the symbiote
in this man has taken a host

21:31.000 --> 21:33.040
before it was mature enough to do so.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.320
And yet our scans indicate it to be
a full-grown adult. Most puzzling.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.240
Can you account for its lack of identity?

21:40.320 --> 21:43.040
Memory is passed on
genetically by the queen,

21:43.120 --> 21:46.440
so they are born with the
collective knowledge of their lineage.

21:46.520 --> 21:51.840
lt is possible the queen that spawned him
was unable to pass on this information.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.480
Unable?

21:54.560 --> 21:58.320
The knowledge imparted on her young
by a queen is done so voluntarily.

21:58.400 --> 22:04.400
lf nothing were passed on to a symbiote
it would be, as you say, an empty vessel.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.240
Can you remove it
without harming the host?

22:08.320 --> 22:12.880
Possibly, although such
a procedure would be dangerous.

22:16.160 --> 22:20.640
We would like to see the queen
that spawned this Goa'uld.

22:24.480 --> 22:27.920
Not a pretty sight,
even for a Goa'uld, huh?

22:28.000 --> 22:32.840
- She is extremely old.
- She has been kept this way for decades?

22:32.960 --> 22:37.600
The Pangarans began using her for
medical experiments over 50 years ago.

22:38.120 --> 22:43.200
She's been breeding symbiotes to make
tretonin for more than half that time.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.480
(O'Neill) All right. Now,
how is that possible?

22:46.560 --> 22:52.240
l mean, how does she make kids
without a... man friend?

22:53.360 --> 22:56.080
Symbiote queens can
fertilise their own eggs.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.360
lt is essentially an asexual process.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.640
ls that why you guys take hosts?

23:02.720 --> 23:08.240
lt is impressive that a primitive human
culture could develop such a drug.

23:08.360 --> 23:11.200
Does it bother you that
they use Goa'ulds like this?

23:11.320 --> 23:13.120
No.

23:13.200 --> 23:15.280
OK.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.680
The Goa'uld have done no worse
than this to humans for centuries.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.840
That Pangarans use them for
a beneficial result is surprising,

23:23.960 --> 23:27.720
but not morally objectionable to me,
if that's what you mean.

23:30.240 --> 23:35.280
l believe her condition is the reason
her offspring are not mentally developed.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.680
Most unfortunate.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.520
What is it?

23:39.640 --> 23:43.400
My scans indicate massive
cellular degeneration.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.320
Quite simply, she is dying.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.200
l am sorry. The Pangarans sugar-coated
the whole side-effect aspect of the drug.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.120
Well, that's a shock.

23:57.240 --> 24:02.360
While tretonin does cure most diseases,
it creates bigger problems than it solves.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.840
How?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.240
The drug acts like
a symbiote in many ways.

24:06.320 --> 24:11.920
Upon entering the bloodstream it takes
over, suppressing the immune system.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.360
The result is a powerful
resistance to disease.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.160
- But...
- The healing effect is not permanent,

24:18.280 --> 24:21.040
and the user's immune system
remains suppressed.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.840
You have to keep taking
the drug for it to work.

24:23.920 --> 24:27.120
We'd never create enough
to sustain our population.

24:27.240 --> 24:30.320
l don't know how the Pangarans
can make enough for theirs.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.960
They don't. Only about
20 per cent are on it.

24:33.040 --> 24:36.320
They're running into a wall
as far as production is concerned.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.120
They've sucked the queen dry, Doc.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.320
According to the Tok'ra, she's dying.

24:42.440 --> 24:47.200
As far as l know there's no way to reverse
the drug's effects. lf their queen is dying,

24:47.280 --> 24:52.000
it's a matter of time before anyone living
off tretonin will be facing death as well.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.960
OK? O'Neill out.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.840
So you wanted the gate addresses
to the Goa'uld worlds

25:05.920 --> 25:09.840
because you wanted
to snag another queen?

25:10.640 --> 25:14.080
Colonel, we have no choice
but to replace the one we have.

25:14.160 --> 25:17.120
Exactly how did you get to this point?

25:18.720 --> 25:24.160
60 years ago our archaeologists found
a secret chamber beneath the temple.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.280
We found a sealed Canopic jar
containing a living female symbiote,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.360
perfectly preserved in stasis.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.600
From our study of the temple, we knew
the Goa'uld never suffered from illness.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.480
We saw this discovery
as an opportunity to learn why.

25:38.600 --> 25:44.240
Once the queen gave birth, we began
experimenting on her offspring,

25:44.360 --> 25:48.720
searching for a way to mimic their
seemingly perfect immune system.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.960
After decades of trying, we
finally came up with tretonin.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.440
- lt seemed like a miracle at first.
- Didn't you foresee the negative effects?

25:57.560 --> 26:02.880
Of course. But what we couldn't predict
was our inability to refine the drug.

26:02.960 --> 26:06.800
We were confident we could solve
the problems. We limited the use,

26:06.880 --> 26:11.440
but ultimately we didn't see why
we shouldn't begin to reap the benefits

26:11.520 --> 26:13.680
while working to overcome the downside.

26:13.760 --> 26:16.040
We know the risks
in confronting the Goa'uld,

26:16.160 --> 26:20.400
but tens of thousands of lives
will be lost if we do nothing.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.080
Perhaps you could assist us.

26:23.680 --> 26:28.480
You have faced the Goa'uld many times.
You could give us a tactical advantage.

26:28.600 --> 26:33.760
No. There is no tactical advantage
when you're dealing with the Goa'uld.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.760
We've stayed ahead because we don't
bite off more than we can chew... usually.

26:39.880 --> 26:44.320
Besides, we need to get you off
the tretonin, not find another source.

26:44.440 --> 26:48.640
Our scientists have been trying for years
to find a way to reverse its effects.

26:48.720 --> 26:52.800
We've made very little progress.
We need more time.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.640
Or more help.

27:02.480 --> 27:05.040
This is important to you.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.440
More so than just curiosity
about your history.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.960
As you now know, the tretonin may
not be available to us for much longer,

27:15.080 --> 27:18.680
and when we run out, those
of us taking it are going to die.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.520
Not if we can help you
find some kind of antidote.

27:21.640 --> 27:25.400
- Do you think that's possible?
- Anything's possible.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.080
- lf we could find a new queen...
- Long-term.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.880
lt's not the answer
but it could buy us a little time

27:33.000 --> 27:37.440
until another option is available.
This has been my life's work.

27:37.560 --> 27:41.040
- My father's life's work.
- Your father?

27:41.160 --> 27:44.560
My father was the one who found
the jar that contained the queen.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.320
He was attempting to remove
a section of the ruins for further study

27:48.440 --> 27:51.520
when he literally stumbled
into the chamber.

27:52.720 --> 27:58.240
He had no way of knowing his discovery
would eventually doom so many people.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.440
The result is not his fault.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.000
No.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.720
Teal'c?

28:16.720 --> 28:19.440
Didn't you say this temple
was built by Shak'ran?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.800
lt was.

28:20.920 --> 28:24.720
Then why does this section
of the fresco mention Ra?

28:27.480 --> 28:30.560
- Who's Ra?
- Ra was a powerful System Lord,

28:30.680 --> 28:32.640
brother of Apophis.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.960
He, too, is dead.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.680
Well, according to this...

28:41.080 --> 28:43.840
Ra used to live here.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.360
- We will examine the drug.
- lf it acts as l suspect,

28:49.480 --> 28:52.960
it may be impossible to perfect
as the Pangarans would hope.

28:53.040 --> 28:56.320
The best we might be able
to do is provide an antidote

28:56.400 --> 28:58.960
to allow their immune
systems to regenerate.

28:59.080 --> 29:03.200
They would not possess
the superior health that they do now.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.120
How long would it take to go from
theoretical to enough for everyone?

29:11.120 --> 29:13.280
We can make no promises,
Colonel O'Neill.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.400
However, as you say, we are in your debt.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.200
We will begin immediately.

29:21.080 --> 29:25.600
lt is possible that Shak'ran
captured this world from Ra in battle.

29:25.720 --> 29:30.080
And built this entire temple on top
of whatever Ra had here before.

29:30.200 --> 29:34.880
lt goes on to say something about
this being some kind of prison,

29:35.000 --> 29:37.680
or a tomb...

29:39.960 --> 29:42.880
for one of Ra's enemies.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.920
Wait a minute.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.760
''Here lies... Egeria...

29:59.480 --> 30:01.520
betrayer of the Goa'uld.''

30:01.600 --> 30:05.600
''May she... suffer...

30:06.640 --> 30:10.320
for all... eternity.''

30:15.560 --> 30:17.120
Egeria.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.920
Dr Jackson's notes mention her.
lsn't she supposed to have been killed?

30:26.000 --> 30:29.760
lndeed she was, but this would
seem to indicate otherwise.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.320
That means...

30:32.440 --> 30:36.960
The queen the Pangarans
are breeding is not Goa'uld.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.840
She is the origin of the Tok'ra.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.960
- This could be a problem.
- Are you sure?

30:47.080 --> 30:50.800
The writings in the chamber
are extremely clear.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.600
From what we can piece together,
Ra used this planet

30:53.720 --> 30:56.880
as his base of operations
in this sector of the galaxy.

30:56.960 --> 31:03.040
A rival Goa'uld, Shak'ran, captured this
world in battle, forcing Ra to abandon it.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.760
The question is, do we tell
Malek and Kelmaa?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.960
How can we not tell them?

31:09.080 --> 31:12.000
lf we remain silent, the
Pangarans will use Egeria

31:12.080 --> 31:14.800
as a source for their drug
until she is dead.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.600
lf we don't find a way to get them off
the drug they'll die eventually anyway.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.440
We have to tell them.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.840
(Carter) Understand we had no
idea who she was until now.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.040
lt is hard to believe.

31:33.120 --> 31:37.960
Many of our historians speculated that Ra
did not kill Egeria as was widely believed,

31:38.080 --> 31:40.080
but we...

31:40.560 --> 31:44.400
we never dared hope that
she would ever be found.

31:44.480 --> 31:49.600
She must be freed. Every moment she
is kept in this condition is an affront.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.480
We're going to talk to the Pangarans now.

31:53.240 --> 31:56.400
lt would help if you had
something to offer.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.720
Like, say, an antidote?

31:59.800 --> 32:05.200
Unfortunately, finding an antidote may be
more problematic than we'd first hoped.

32:05.280 --> 32:06.960
And why is that?

32:07.040 --> 32:12.240
There is something unusual about
the genetic structure of the symbiotes.

32:12.320 --> 32:17.040
The tretonin should work far better than
it does. We're not sure why it doesn't.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.680
We cannot seem to identify
the defective gene

32:19.800 --> 32:22.400
that is causing its effects to break down.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.760
But we can say you'll solve
this eventually, right?

32:27.560 --> 32:30.800
At this moment, all l can
say is it is a mystery.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.080
What, you're suddenly stumped?

32:34.160 --> 32:36.400
l understand the implication, Colonel.

32:36.520 --> 32:41.840
This revelation about Egeria is in no way
affecting our analysis of the tretonin.

32:44.320 --> 32:47.200
As of right now, we cannot
help the Pangarans.

32:52.240 --> 32:54.320
We could not have known.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.600
Surely the Tok'ra don't hold us
directly responsible?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.640
They're demanding
the release of their queen.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.760
How could we? lt would doom
thousands without a remedy.

33:03.840 --> 33:08.560
The Tok'ra have suffered great losses.
Their numbers are severely diminished.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.680
Restoring Egeria's health may be
their only hope of survival as a people.

33:13.800 --> 33:18.560
Have they made no progress at all
in reversing the effects of tretonin?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.920
- Sorry. You ask the impossible.
- She is our queen.

33:26.040 --> 33:30.320
- Her freedom is not open for negotiation.
- We deeply regret who she is,

33:30.440 --> 33:33.120
but freeing her would mean
death for many people.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.880
- Unless you offer an alternative.
- Malek and Kelmaa are having trouble

33:37.000 --> 33:40.560
locating a particular element
in the symbiote's genetic structure.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.200
Until they do, the chances of
synthesising an antidote are slim.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.920
- Then we have no choice.
- You do not understand.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.960
Her existence is a miracle to the Tok'ra.
We are also a dying race.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.160
You may lose thousands.
Our kind will become extinct.

34:19.199 --> 34:23.360
l am sympathetic to the Tok'ra, but what
you ask would amount to a holocaust.

34:23.480 --> 34:29.040
She is a sentient being. Using her in this
manner is an insult to our very existence.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.840
Someone has breached security
in the manufacturing wing.

34:44.760 --> 34:47.360
What has she done?

34:47.960 --> 34:49.920
Uh, is that...

34:50.760 --> 34:52.719
Was that...

34:53.719 --> 34:56.480
Kelmaa has given her life for our queen.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.400
Her host belongs to Egeria now.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.880
l bet the Pangarans would give up the
queen if the Tok'ra hand over the antidote.

35:12.000 --> 35:16.000
You think they know how to save the
Pangarans and are withholding a cure?

35:16.120 --> 35:18.680
To get what they wanted? Yeah, sure.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.640
Sir, with all due respect, l disagree.

35:21.720 --> 35:25.040
- Carter, they're pissed off.
- Wouldn't you be?

35:25.160 --> 35:30.960
They just discovered the founder of their
race has been abused for over 50 years.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.080
Oh, come on, Carter, face it.
For all their high morals

35:34.160 --> 35:37.760
and fancy preaching about
coexisting with humans,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.440
we are just a nice place to live.

35:40.520 --> 35:44.240
l don't think they would lie and
doom thousands of innocent people.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.760
That Tok'ra laying on
that table in there just did.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.200
Egeria has awakened.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.760
- Egeria, it is an honour.
- Rise, Malek.

36:02.520 --> 36:05.640
You are not my servant.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.800
Kelmaa was generous in
giving her life to free me,

36:10.920 --> 36:14.000
but l am afraid it is too late.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.880
Save your strength, my queen. Your
people need you, now more than ever.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.800
Kelmaa's assessment of my
condition was correct, Malek.

36:24.160 --> 36:26.800
My time is almost done.

36:26.920 --> 36:31.120
l shall not live long enough
to see more of my children.

36:35.640 --> 36:40.480
My host has shared her knowledge
of the Tok'ra with me.

36:44.720 --> 36:49.200
You are beyond my greatest
hopes and dreams.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.960
These are the Tauri, who ally
themselves with the Tok'ra.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
l know.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.000
Come forward.

37:05.440 --> 37:09.360
My host tells me you seek
to help the Pangarans,

37:09.440 --> 37:11.640
despite what they have done to me.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.360
This has all been a terrible mistake,
but not a malicious act.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.240
Nor was mine, Major Carter.

37:39.200 --> 37:44.160
You know, back on my home planet,
my people discovered a substance

37:44.280 --> 37:48.240
that had an incredible potential
to generate energy.

37:49.680 --> 37:55.200
And after years of research and
a serious lack of moral fortitude,

37:57.320 --> 38:00.120
they used it to make a bomb.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.440
Well, that being the reason l left.

38:06.040 --> 38:11.280
But the point is that your
people had good intentions.

38:11.720 --> 38:15.400
We thought we had found
the cure for all disease.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.480
Now it may kill so many of us.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.720
l am not afraid to die,
but l am afraid that...

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
my people will not have learned from this.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.040
l think they already have.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.240
l passed on the flawed gene
that gave the drug its weakness.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.880
You were unable to construct an antidote

38:52.000 --> 38:56.120
because of the manner in
which l sabotaged my young.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.440
l did it in the hope

38:59.520 --> 39:03.880
that they would ultimately prove
useless to the Pangarans.

39:05.320 --> 39:11.680
l wanted to force them to abandon their
research once the drug proved untenable.

39:11.800 --> 39:17.280
lnstead, they continued to make it
in ever-increasing quantities.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.720
And now they can't live without it.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.360
lt is not what l intended.

39:25.200 --> 39:27.760
Their fate is their own doing, not yours.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.120
You merely tried to free yourself.

39:30.240 --> 39:34.960
They do not deserve this end,
not when it can be prevented.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.560
You created the flaw.

39:42.640 --> 39:45.080
You can create the antidote
that will save them.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.880
l will tell you what you need to know.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.200
Thank you.

39:51.280 --> 39:56.000
On behalf of our people, please,
forgive us for what we have done to you.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.520
Had we known, we...

39:59.600 --> 40:04.520
The salvation of the Pangarans
shall be my final act.

40:05.800 --> 40:10.880
Such is the spirit of Tok'ra
that l wish to live on.

40:36.040 --> 40:39.040
Malek says he should have
a prototype antidote soon.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.800
We are grateful for his efforts,
Major, and yours.

40:42.920 --> 40:48.480
lt is our hope we can repair any mistrust
that may have developed between us,

40:48.600 --> 40:52.880
so that we can pursue a long-lasting
friendship between our people

40:52.960 --> 40:54.960
far into the future.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.040
Well said.
