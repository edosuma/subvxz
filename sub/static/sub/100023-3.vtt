WEBVTT

00:09.801 --> 00:11.553
So, you're out there...

00:11.636 --> 00:13.346
Moving rocks. Yes.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.516
- Because?
- They were in the wrong place.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.185
According to who?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.354
According to the water
that is meant to flow there.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.690
Not just sit stagnant like an invitation

00:23.773 --> 00:25.613
for all the leptospira and giardia
in the area.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.111
Okay.
So, you were moving the rocks from...

00:28.194 --> 00:29.738
From the bed to the stream.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.073
It reduces the chance
of bacterial outbreak.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.035
Look, the fact that these developers,
they don't even consider bacteria

00:35.118 --> 00:38.163
when they dump a couple hundred
cubic feet of topsoil

00:38.246 --> 00:40.415
onto an otherwise healthy hydro system...

00:41.791 --> 00:43.501
Why were you doing it at night?

00:43.668 --> 00:45.920
- Why not during the day?
- Because my days are busy.

00:46.004 --> 00:49.299
All right, this state is full of rivers
on the brink of collapse.

00:49.382 --> 00:52.093
I have reports that I have to write,
bids to submit.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.762
Oh, then I'll just cut to the chase.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.723
Why don't you tell me where you were
on the night of April 22nd?

00:56.806 --> 00:58.058
On the 22nd?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.645
I was at a conference in Albuquerque.

01:02.729 --> 01:06.024
- Anyone who can confirm that?
- Only the 300 or so attendees.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.859
Plus, the organizers.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.820
Plus, the video that was uploaded
of the lecture I gave.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.449
Can I go now? Are we done?

01:14.532 --> 01:16.201
Do you have a wife, Mr. Graham?

01:16.284 --> 01:18.578
Or girlfriend or sisters? Or...

01:18.828 --> 01:19.913
I have three sisters.

01:19.996 --> 01:20.996
Do me a favor.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.708
Take a second to imagine how you'd feel
if one of those sisters

01:23.792 --> 01:25.960
was tied up and raped at gunpoint.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.089
Think about the commitment
you would expect

01:29.172 --> 01:31.132
from the detectives working the case.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.365
Now think about the witnesses
they brought in for questioning.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.515
How you would hope that they would do
anything they could

01:38.598 --> 01:40.934
to assist in the apprehension
of the monster

01:41.017 --> 01:44.938
who could inflict such irreversible harm
on your sister.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.158
Thank you
for your extremely valuable time.

02:19.973 --> 02:23.017
Karen Duvall, Golden PD.
I'm looking for Grace Rasmussen.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.281
Grace Rasmussen?

02:36.781 --> 02:37.949
Right over there.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.248
- Grace Rasmussen?
- Yeah.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.541
I'm, uh, Karen Duvall.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.670
I left a message, but I didn't hear back,
so I figured I'd drop by.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.839
I'm a detective over in Golden.

02:52.922 --> 02:54.966
My husband is Max Duvall.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.092
Oh, Max the Knife.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.844
Oh, is that, uh...

02:58.970 --> 03:00.096
What can I do for you?

03:00.805 --> 03:02.432
I'm working a rape case in my district.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.809
I was talking it through with Max
last night.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.020
He said you might have one that's similar.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.897
Really? Tell me what you got.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.902
So, when I told Max
about him making her shower,

03:13.985 --> 03:16.362
that's what got his attention.
I guess your guy did too?

03:16.446 --> 03:18.406
Yeah, 20 minutes. He set the kitchen timer

03:18.489 --> 03:20.885
and told my victim not to come out
of the shower until it dinged.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.679
Mine was ten, and he stood there
watching her for every second of it.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.871
- So not identical...
- No.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.749
- And?
- Another win. Still undefeated.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.459
I love it.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.213
So, then Max asked
if my guy carried a blue backpack,

03:33.296 --> 03:34.505
which he did.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.007
I... I guess yours did too?

03:36.090 --> 03:37.884
Yeah, but I don't know what color.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.844
Hey, hop in, okay? I gotta be somewhere.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.230
I got the call around nine in the morning.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.982
The victim was at the hospital
by the time I got to her.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.235
Nice woman, late 50s.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.654
Kinda fragile, you know?
Even before all this.

03:58.321 --> 04:00.361
Our first interview,
she kept calling herself stupid

04:00.406 --> 04:01.991
for leaving her window open.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.953
Like every person in Colorado
doesn't leave a window cracked at night.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.248
Yeah. She'd just moved into her place,
like, a couple of months before.

04:08.331 --> 04:11.209
She wakes up in the middle of the night
with this weight on her back.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.670
It's a man on top of her.
He pins her arms.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.273
Tells her he's got a gun, he's gonna
use it if she gives him trouble.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.966
- When was this?
- The 22nd. About a month ago.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.513
He proceeds to rape her for three hours.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.596
On and off.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.265
I mean...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.434
Same thing with my victim.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.272
Stopping and starting for four hours.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.897
Huh.

04:34.732 --> 04:38.027
Well, after, he did the shower thing,
by the time she gets out, he's gone.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.197
- Took her sheets, her pillow, blankets.
- Yeah, same with mine.

04:41.906 --> 04:44.284
He left the scene so clean
you could eat off it.

04:44.367 --> 04:48.288
My team searched every dumpster
within a two-mile radius, every trash can.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.582
They scoured ditches, we dragged a pond,
hoping to find something.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.876
The gun, her sheets, or...

04:54.419 --> 04:56.421
- No luck?
- Nada.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.423
I mean,
I got a few leads from the neighbors:

04:58.506 --> 05:01.175
a cable guy some folks thought
was a bit creepy.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.512
Which he was, but he's a cable guy, so...

05:06.514 --> 05:07.807
Anyway, he checked out.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.519
There were a few other shifty dudes,
some with assault records.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.604
But I just cleared the last one yesterday.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.649
So, you know, an asshole,
just not our asshole.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.281
Billy Boy, you got the goods?

05:55.646 --> 05:58.816
I did get one promising
little bit of info this morning.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.153
Turns out the victim's first husband,
whom she neglected to mention,

06:02.236 --> 06:04.238
was convicted of rape 30 years ago.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.574
- That's a weird coincidence.
- Yeah.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.202
Wouldn't she recognize her ex?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.285
You'd think,

06:10.620 --> 06:13.456
but they divorced a couple lifetimes ago,
so who knows?

06:14.415 --> 06:17.251
All I know is
it is an unanswered question,

06:17.335 --> 06:19.212
so I am gonna ask it.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.351
You can come.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.603
Just let me do the talking.

06:47.782 --> 06:50.260
- You got a nice morning light.
- That's why I picked it.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.162
I figured, starting every day
with this view

06:53.246 --> 06:54.831
would put me in a good frame of mind.

06:54.914 --> 06:55.998
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.333
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

06:58.042 --> 07:02.004
Oh, uh, let me move this
so you can sit down.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.842
I'm sorry, I'm still in transition here.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.010
No, I get it. No need to explain.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.638
So...

07:11.556 --> 07:13.975
listen, I want to ask you
about your first husband,

07:14.308 --> 07:15.351
Richard Jackson.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.811
Oh, wow, Richie.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.606
You know, I haven't even
thought about him since, uh...

07:21.023 --> 07:22.191
God, I don't know when.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.902
Yeah, you didn't mention him
when we talked before.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.780
Yeah, well, that's what's called
successful denial.

07:27.864 --> 07:32.160
I mean, it was all so stupid.
I was 19. He was bad news.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.329
And after a few months of hell,
he left me for another girl,

07:35.413 --> 07:38.374
and I went crawling home
with my tail between my legs.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.377
Did you know he'd been convicted of rape
before you married?

07:42.545 --> 07:45.173
- He had?
- Yes. He served six months.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.260
- Does that surprise you?
- A little.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.637
I mean, I guess not really, no.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.640
I ask because his rape record
is relevant here.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.244
Wait a minute. Are you saying that
you think he could be the one?

07:57.268 --> 08:00.438
- Uh, it definitely gets my attention.
- Oh, no. No, there's no way.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.316
Richie was five-five on a tall day.

08:03.399 --> 08:04.901
And plus, he's my age now.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.278
No, this man was young,

08:07.820 --> 08:09.947
and tall, and strong.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.783
- Mm.
- But I guess you'll look into that.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.577
I know you have to do your job.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.661
I do,

08:16.287 --> 08:17.455
but I hear you.

08:19.248 --> 08:22.460
You know, I'm glad that you came by,
though. I was gonna call you.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.004
I realized something today.

08:25.838 --> 08:29.258
This is the drawer
that I put my cash in and...

08:29.342 --> 08:31.945
Well, this morning I went to get it -
and I thought I'd go to the market -

08:31.969 --> 08:33.846
and it was gone.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.556
He must have taken it.

08:36.890 --> 08:39.101
- How much was it?
- Two hundred dollars.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.812
I'm also missing a camera.

08:41.895 --> 08:45.024
Um, I looked through everything,
but it's... it's just not there.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.652
- He must have taken that too.
- What kind of camera is it?

08:48.569 --> 08:51.572
A Sony Cyber-shot.
You know, one of the pink ones.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.956
- Anything else missing?
- No, just those two things.

09:00.289 --> 09:01.290
Okay.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.293
And, um...

09:05.795 --> 09:07.838
how are you doing in general?

09:08.130 --> 09:09.130
Me?

09:09.382 --> 09:10.508
Yeah, you.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.719
I'll be all right.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.223
I mean, I... I'll be fine. I just, uh...

09:18.266 --> 09:19.433
need to...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.895
Well, there's a lot that I need to do.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.691
Yeah, then I will leave you to it.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.735
And like I said before,
if... if anything comes up...

09:29.819 --> 09:32.196
Yes, of course.
I'll... I'll call you right away.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.408
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you, Detective.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.578
Can I just ask one question?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.162
Yes, of course.

09:40.371 --> 09:43.291
Did you happen to notice
if your assailant had a birthmark?

09:43.374 --> 09:48.129
Uh... Oh, no, I don't.
I explained this to Detective Rasmussen

09:48.212 --> 09:52.592
that I still can't really call up
any visual memories of...

09:52.675 --> 09:55.720
I... I remember sounds.
The camera clicking, I remember that.

09:55.803 --> 09:59.765
And the backpack zipping and unzipping,
but no images.

09:59.849 --> 10:03.102
It's really common, Sarah.
It's self-defense.

10:03.477 --> 10:07.064
For some people, locking in on every
single visual detail is what helps them.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.776
But for you, it was the opposite.
It was shuttin' it all out.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.447
Well, I'm... Anyway, I'm sorry
that I can't be more helpful.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.950
Please don't apologize for doing
what you needed to do to feel safe.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.286
I'm sorry.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.496
- All right.
- Okay.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.248
- Thanks again.
- Thank you.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.253
A pink Cyber-shot is the camera

10:29.337 --> 10:31.505
Amber's rapist used
to take pictures of her.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.759
He stole it from your victim
and used it on mine.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.926
Hey, get the local and national
sales figures

10:36.010 --> 10:37.386
on pink Sony Cyber-shot cameras,

10:37.470 --> 10:40.430
then suss out from that how many
there might be in circulation around here.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.474
Thanks.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.060
I asked you not to talk.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.910
I know her, okay?

11:02.411 --> 11:04.872
Her psyche is held together
by spit and a prayer.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.541
She does not need more questions
about the rape fired at her

11:07.625 --> 11:10.670
- from yet another person with a badge.
- Okay. I'm sorry, it seems relevant.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.088
One she's never met.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.281
Well, you could have introduced me.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.093
- Just...
- Fine.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.973
She's my victim. This is my case.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.019
I said fine.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.653
So what else?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.033
What else did you learn from your victim
besides the birthmark?

11:43.911 --> 11:46.372
Uh, he speaks four languages.

11:46.455 --> 11:49.542
He's visited the Philippines,
Korea, Thailand.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.543
Possible military.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.626
Yep.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.717
It sounds like there's enough similarities

11:57.800 --> 12:00.177
to warrant opening our full files
to each other.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.261
I agree.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.389
I'll send you access codes.
You do the same?

12:03.472 --> 12:04.932
Yeah, sounds good.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.579
Yeah. I'm here.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.082
I just pulled up.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.627
I'll try to get to her
before she hears about it.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.672
Colleen, how would I know
how they got her name?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.842
I got this. It's 5:00.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.427
Oh, okay. Thanks.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.932
I see her. She's still working.
I'll let you know.

12:48.809 --> 12:49.935
Marie.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.442
Marie.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.738
Hey, what are you doing here?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.699
I thought I would give you a ride home.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.035
I have my bike.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.872
I can put it in the back.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.374
Don't.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.502
- Don't what?
- Don't look at that.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.547
- Wh... why?
- Just let me have it.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.090
Stop! What are you doing?

13:20.174 --> 13:22.593
I am trying to take care of you.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.678
- Just stop!
- Marie, really?

13:25.012 --> 13:26.764
Oh, boy.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.316
These are from everybody.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.153
Some of these people I barely even know.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.244
- I guess someone gave them my name?
- I guess, yes.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.328
Who would do that?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.831
I don't know, honey.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.001
Don't answer that.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.920
Marie, for goodness sake.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.922
Hello?

14:01.507 --> 14:03.759
Yeah, well, I told you not to pick up.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.594
Why won't you listen to me?

14:07.137 --> 14:09.807
Marie, if you answer that, I swear to God.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.100
Well, maybe it's a friend.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.352
Honey, you don't have any friends
right now.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.312
It's true.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.774
I mean, my God, look at what your
so-called friends did to you.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.786
Sometimes you can be really mean, Judith.
You know that?

14:34.999 --> 14:35.999
Marie?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.252
Marie, get back in the car.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.342
Marie, I am driving.

14:46.844 --> 14:47.844
Marie.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.137
Marie!

14:50.598 --> 14:51.598
Marie!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.620
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
have to ask you all to leave.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.097
We're just trying to do our job.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.682
And I'm also trying to do my job.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.334
This is private property,
and you can't be here.

15:18.709 --> 15:19.709
Is that her?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.279
How about this one?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.574
No. Not what I'm after.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.034
Thanks.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.580
This is the closest to pink I've got.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.457
Yeah, it's not what I'm after.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.543
Okay. Well, call me if something turns up?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.754
- Sure. Good luck.
- Thanks. Later.

16:04.880 --> 16:05.798
- Still here?
- Yeah.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.841
I just came back to hit those
last two apartments.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.510
- Anything?
- No.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.345
No one heard anything,
no one saw anything.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.306
All right, thanks.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.390
Yep.

16:17.559 --> 16:21.772
It's a victim's compensation fund,
set up to make up any lost wages,

16:22.189 --> 16:24.066
any medical expenses.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.073
Anyway, give 'em a call.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.158
Even if you haven't lost job hours...

16:34.618 --> 16:36.078
there's a cost to trauma.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.496
If you need a therapist...

16:37.579 --> 16:38.664
Have you gotten him?

16:40.457 --> 16:41.542
The man who attacked you?

16:42.543 --> 16:43.543
Yes.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.170
Not yet, no.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.964
Do you know who he is?

16:47.047 --> 16:48.132
Not yet.

16:49.925 --> 16:53.470
However, I did discover another assault,

16:54.346 --> 16:57.349
very similar to yours,
that happened in the area recently.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.686
So, y... you think it might be
the same person?

17:01.687 --> 17:02.687
The same...

17:02.771 --> 17:04.647
Possibly, yes.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.568
So, that means
he's gonna do it again, right?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.486
To someone else?

17:10.319 --> 17:13.365
I mean, who just rapes two people
and then...

17:13.699 --> 17:15.451
Not if we catch him first.

17:15.534 --> 17:18.119
I read if the rapist isn't found
within seven days,

17:18.203 --> 17:21.330
the odds that he'll ever get caught
drop significantly.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.708
Is that true?

17:23.083 --> 17:26.670
Um, statistically, yes,
but every case is...

17:26.753 --> 17:30.674
So, basically, if you don't find this guy
in five days, you never will.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.886
No. As I said, that is not necessarily...

17:33.969 --> 17:35.763
Yeah, well, I'm a mathematician.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.264
I believe the numbers.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.768
So, given that you have five days
to catch this guy,

17:42.144 --> 17:43.562
what are you doing here?

17:58.118 --> 18:00.579
Did we get
the surveillance footage

18:00.662 --> 18:03.165
from the businesses
near Amber's apartment yet?

18:03.499 --> 18:06.668
- Yeah, I sent you the links.
- How about the lab reports?

18:07.586 --> 18:08.670
Not back yet.

18:08.879 --> 18:09.879
Why not?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.591
I don't know, just...

18:14.009 --> 18:15.009
Just what?

18:15.511 --> 18:17.679
How long does it take
to process a rape kit?

18:19.598 --> 18:21.225
That's not a rhetorical question.

18:21.308 --> 18:23.268
Uh, about a day or so
if we request a rush.

18:23.352 --> 18:24.352
Did we?

18:25.979 --> 18:27.064
Request a rush?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.775
- Yes.
- And it's been...

18:31.110 --> 18:34.738
49, 50 hours
since our victim left the hospital?

18:34.822 --> 18:38.033
No one thought to pick up a phone,
call the lab,

18:38.117 --> 18:39.660
ask where it is?

18:39.743 --> 18:42.788
You know the labs are always late.
I'm sure the report's on the way.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.665
Oh, really? You're sure?

18:45.791 --> 18:48.460
Great. Mia, relax.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.087
Everything's right on track.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.339
Morris is sure of it.

18:52.422 --> 18:54.925
I'm not the enemy, Detective.
You don't have to yell at me.

18:55.175 --> 18:56.593
I sure shouldn't have to.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.058
Look around, Morris.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.102
What do you see?

19:06.728 --> 19:07.729
I'll answer that.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.648
A whole lot of human beings.

19:09.731 --> 19:13.569
All well-intentioned,
but wildly capable of error.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.322
And fine. Fallibility, I get that.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.867
But when we're talking
about a violent rapist,

19:20.242 --> 19:23.245
a guy who, at any minute,
could break into another woman's house

19:23.328 --> 19:25.080
and scar another woman for life...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.082
Because this is not something
people get over.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.210
This is something they carry
with them forever,

19:30.294 --> 19:32.004
like a bullet in the spine.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.341
So, given that, yeah,
I do expect everyone on my team

19:36.425 --> 19:40.053
to give me 100 percent of their effort
100 percent of the time.

19:40.137 --> 19:40.971
Right, got it.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.057
And that means triple-checking
that the work is done right,

19:44.308 --> 19:47.686
the report is thorough,
and the lab delivers its results on time.

19:47.769 --> 19:51.356
If that seems beyond your capabilities
or your field of interest,

19:52.191 --> 19:54.276
maybe another team would be a better fit.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.238
The labs had a mix-up on their end.

19:58.530 --> 20:01.408
- They're sending them over now.
- Well, there you go.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.165
Check this out.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.299
It's a pattern that was on the frame
of the sliding door

20:17.382 --> 20:19.301
to the Westminster victim's deck.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.719
From what?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.095
Clothing?

20:22.554 --> 20:24.014
I don't know.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.391
It could be a glove,
but judging by their notes,

20:26.475 --> 20:27.768
Westminster doesn't know either.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.145
- That's the whole Westminster file?
- Mm-hmm.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
It's huge. They're...

20:32.731 --> 20:33.731
thorough.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.816
Yeah.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.277
That's Grace Rasmussen.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.864
- She's impressive.
- You worked with her before?

20:40.948 --> 20:41.948
No.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.494
We just met once, way back.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.372
I don't think she remembers.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.791
I was a rookie. She was in Narcotics.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.585
Well, she runs a good investigation.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.669
It's gonna take us a while
to get through all this.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.881
- Yeah, split it up between the four of us.
- Okay.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.510
Cancel your dinner plans, guys,
we got work to do.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.895
Mommy?

21:54.604 --> 21:55.689
I'm scared.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.983
Oh, baby.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.651
Of what?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.946
It's okay, sweetie.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.743
I got you.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.191
That one, right there.
That's the cleanest shot I could find.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.361
Will it get me a plate?

23:24.820 --> 23:27.531
I don't know.
That's pretty shitty video. We'll see.

23:27.614 --> 23:28.824
How long does it take?

23:29.324 --> 23:30.700
A few seconds. Hang tight.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.748
How's the man?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.127
- Fine.
- His knee better?

23:40.836 --> 23:41.670
Yeah.

23:41.753 --> 23:45.298
You know, going all monosyllabic on me
isn't gonna make that program go faster.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.427
I'm sorry. Uh...

23:51.304 --> 23:54.558
It's fine. He's been icing it.
Says it's at 90%.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.852
Good, we need him back at shortstop.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.938
We're playing Lakewood, they got that guy
who played in the minors.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.111
Oh, shit.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.070
What?

24:09.948 --> 24:11.032
That's it?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.494
- I can't read that plate.
- Like I said, with an image this low res.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.662
Use a better program.

24:15.745 --> 24:18.290
This is the best program that exists,
anywhere.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.209
It's what the FBI uses, CIA, everyone.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.545
But there's a plate number there.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.546
Right there.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.299
- I can almost see it.
- Let me see if I can grab a better frame.

24:36.766 --> 24:38.953
Maybe you can get stronger
surveillance video from another store?

24:38.977 --> 24:40.020
I checked.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.814
Give me a sec.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.910
It's frustrating.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.161
Yes.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.373
At least I know it's a Mazda
with a broken mirror.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.751
- I'll do a full dig on that.
- Great.

25:02.834 --> 25:04.920
- Oh, hey, before you go.
- What?

25:09.883 --> 25:11.968
We got foreign DNA off Amber's face.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.973
Now, don't get too excited,
it's only about seven or eight skin cells.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.265
Hey.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.560
Eight cells is eight more cells
than nothing.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.771
Is CBI doing a Y-STR?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.021
Yes.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.482
Okay.

25:28.401 --> 25:30.320
Let me know when it gets back.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.540
I'm thinking it's a simple request.

25:41.623 --> 25:43.708
Let me see all the birthmarks
that have come through

25:43.792 --> 25:45.186
- the state prison system.
- Right.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.380
No, the state doesn't file them that way.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.801
Instead, they have one big category for...
"body markings."

25:53.218 --> 25:54.052
Oh, Lordy.

25:54.135 --> 25:57.222
Birthmarks, yes, but also scars.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.558
- And biggest subset, of course...
- Tattoos.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.477
And they don't group these tats
by body part either.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.145
That would make way too much sense.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.983
I mean, ass tattoos
of all kinds of crazy shit,

26:08.066 --> 26:11.027
including one ass tattoo of an ass.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.445
Penis tattoos.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.781
One of which said "mom."

26:15.365 --> 26:18.827
Anyway, I also made my way through
the birthmarks.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.745
There were quite a few on legs.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.665
Only one matched
the other victim's description,

26:23.748 --> 26:27.043
and the owner of that was a guest
of the State at the time of both assaults.

26:27.127 --> 26:31.089
So, long story interminable,
whoever our guy is,

26:31.172 --> 26:34.342
he's never been arrested or locked up
in the good state of Colorado.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.511
Ah, shit. Oh, well.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.598
He also hasn't pawned off the pink
Cyber-shot camera anywhere in the county.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.932
- I checked.
- Yeah.

26:41.308 --> 26:42.308
So did I.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.395
But thanks, I mean, good.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.981
Rosemarie, Detective Karen Duvall.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.649
OIC in the Golden case.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.693
Hmm. Any relation to Max the Knife?

26:51.776 --> 26:53.820
- Her husband.
- Really?

26:54.821 --> 26:55.821
Interesting.

26:56.406 --> 27:00.035
This is Elias.
Elias is a data analysis intern.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.703
He's shadowing me this month.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.331
Maybe I'll get a tattoo of an ass
on my ass.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.124
It's kinda meta.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.207
What's up?

27:08.043 --> 27:10.337
So, it's the same block
as my victim's apartment.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.798
It does 11 passes
over the course of a few hours.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.299
Couldn't pull a plate.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.678
And it disappears a few hours
before the rape,

27:18.762 --> 27:20.764
but I don't know, it bugs me.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.706
Why's it driving by so many times
in the middle of the night?

27:23.767 --> 27:26.162
Could be lots of possible reasons.
Fight with the wife, maybe?

27:26.186 --> 27:27.646
Recharging a dead battery?

27:27.729 --> 27:28.938
Cruising for blow jobs?

27:29.189 --> 27:30.190
Um...

27:30.690 --> 27:33.234
Anyway, uh, I'm looking into Mazda sales.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.111
I'm seeing if any body shops
or dealerships

27:35.195 --> 27:37.656
have a record of one with a broken mirror,
all that.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.539
Okay, well, let me know if you need
a car guy. 'Cause I got a good one.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.043
I also got our labs back.

27:50.126 --> 27:53.004
Uh, we got a few skin cells
off our victim's face.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.215
Seven, eight maybe.

27:55.298 --> 27:57.842
Not enough for a full DNA profile.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.679
- So, no CODIS.
- No, lab's doing Y-STRs.

28:00.762 --> 28:05.684
CODIS is the FBI database where all
the millions of DNA profiles are stored.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.270
In order for a DNA profile to be entered
into the CODIS database,

28:09.354 --> 28:13.108
it has to be a 13-loci profile.
That's a lot more than eight cells.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.984
Oh, my God, woman.

28:15.068 --> 28:19.864
You need a threshold amount of spit
or semen or blood or skin.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.617
No, I... I understood. I studied genetics.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.536
Don't be underestimating my intern.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.205
When the sample size
is too small for CODIS,

28:27.288 --> 28:29.290
there's another DNA test we can use:

28:29.374 --> 28:33.753
Y-STRs, which look for
short tandem repeats in the DNA.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.422
Still with us, Mr. Genome?

28:36.798 --> 28:40.051
Sure, the test looks for repetitive
small sequences

28:40.135 --> 28:41.678
of DNA on the Y chromosome.

28:41.761 --> 28:43.638
Mm. Mr. Genome sure is.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.474
And since only men have the Y chromosome,

28:46.558 --> 28:49.144
this test automatically
cuts the suspect pool in half.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.227
Correct. No women.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.857
And can narrow it down,
but can't make a positive ID.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.191
Correct again.

28:55.275 --> 29:00.864
The Y-STR result can only tell if a male
is from a certain bloodline or family.

29:00.947 --> 29:03.575
It can't tell which male
in the family it is,

29:03.658 --> 29:05.076
or even if it was just one.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.579
It could be one guy
or a guy and his brother,

29:07.662 --> 29:08.913
a guy and his father.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.665
The family that rapes together...

29:12.083 --> 29:15.003
We got a tiny sample too,
from her kitchen timer.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.921
CBI did Y-STRs on ours too.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.632
We should have CBI compare
our two samples.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.508
Just did.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.012
Oh.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.138
Good.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.410
What?

29:49.412 --> 29:50.455
Just a thought.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.835
- What?
- Okay, uh,

29:55.919 --> 29:58.421
say, for the sake of argument,
we're looking at the same guy.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.505
Yeah?

29:59.714 --> 30:00.840
Two rapes,

30:01.674 --> 30:03.802
all he leaves behind
is a handful of cells?

30:04.469 --> 30:06.304
That's less than I'll leave
on this counter.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.723
- Your point?
- I only know two groups of people

30:08.807 --> 30:10.350
who are that DNA-conscious.

30:10.683 --> 30:14.896
Smart criminals, of which we both know
there are very few,

30:16.439 --> 30:17.899
and, uh...

30:18.274 --> 30:19.274
Let's take a walk.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.951
Oh, shit, I don't want it to be a cop.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.454
It might not be.

30:31.538 --> 30:33.289
Yeah, but you're right. It might.

30:36.042 --> 30:37.252
How about this?

30:37.585 --> 30:41.047
We reach out to IA
in every department in a...

30:41.923 --> 30:43.258
a 50-mile radius.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.759
We tell 'em what we got,

30:45.134 --> 30:48.471
and we ask 'em, "Is there anyone
on your rolls who raises a red flag?"

30:48.555 --> 30:49.848
Okay.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.644
Yeah, well, I... I see that playing out
in one of two ways.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.521
One, IA helps us,

30:56.604 --> 30:59.357
and inside of ten seconds,
everyone knows we think it might be a cop.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.109
Or two, IA doesn't help us,

31:01.192 --> 31:03.879
and inside of ten seconds,
everyone knows we think it might be a cop.

31:03.903 --> 31:05.697
I mean, maybe it's different in Golden,

31:05.780 --> 31:08.575
but here, that is a speedy way
to get yourself iced out

31:08.658 --> 31:11.077
of all the support you're gonna need
on this investigation.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.703
Right?

31:17.208 --> 31:19.252
All right, let's think about it.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.923
Right. Nice to see you too.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.100
You've investigated dirty cops, right?

31:35.393 --> 31:36.686
Uh, not me personally,

31:38.271 --> 31:39.647
but our office, sure.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.567
That's the Attorney General domain.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.527
It's tricky, huh?

31:46.529 --> 31:47.780
It can be,

31:47.864 --> 31:49.824
but dirty's dirty.

31:52.744 --> 31:57.248
<i>♪ Where do I sleep at night? ♪</i>

31:58.833 --> 32:00.209
- Why, you got one?
- I don't know.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.253
Maybe.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.546
<i>♪ Tell me why ♪</i>

32:03.630 --> 32:04.630
Well...

32:05.298 --> 32:06.466
watch your step.

32:06.549 --> 32:10.094
<i>♪ Where do I sleep at night? ♪</i>

32:40.083 --> 32:41.292
Marie, it's me.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.388
Hey.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.026
I hate people.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.861
Me too.

33:17.036 --> 33:18.997
Maybe you don't want to talk about it,

33:19.914 --> 33:23.251
but I want you to know, I never
told the cops I didn't believe you.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.837
I wouldn't have.

33:26.921 --> 33:28.089
'Cause I did.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.221
I guess I ju... I don't understand why.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.682
Connor, do you know how many situations
I have been in

33:37.765 --> 33:41.477
where grown-ups want something messed-up
from me that I don't want to give them?

33:41.561 --> 33:44.063
Or they want me to say something
that I don't want to say,

33:44.147 --> 33:46.524
or they want me to do something
that I don't want to do?

33:47.734 --> 33:48.734
A lot.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.571
Like, a lot a lot.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.159
And when I was little,
I... I... I used to...

33:56.826 --> 33:58.077
fight back.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.788
And I thought if I was
a big enough asshole,

34:01.122 --> 34:04.125
they wouldn't mess with me.
And that's just not how...

34:04.208 --> 34:05.710
that's just not how it works.

34:07.420 --> 34:11.591
I had this foster dad once that was
just messing with me, and I bit him, hard.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.803
He slapped me across the face
ten times harder.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.518
When they're bigger than you,
you can't win.

34:30.275 --> 34:31.319
I'm sorry.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.820
Don't apologize.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.699
Just...
I want all of that to go away.

34:37.784 --> 34:38.784
It will.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.292
No, not, like, away,
but it'll all get smaller.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.752
It'll stop mattering.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.130
Like this stuff, I promise...

34:52.672 --> 34:53.674
one day,

34:54.592 --> 34:57.762
pretty soon really,
no one will remember any of it.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.158
And then something else
that's none of their business at all

35:01.182 --> 35:04.102
will come along, and they'll be
more interested in that instead.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.444
And by then, I'll have my license.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.322
Yeah.

35:17.698 --> 35:19.117
And you'll have saved up...

35:19.867 --> 35:21.702
and bought yourself a car.

35:26.541 --> 35:29.293
And I can go wherever I want,
whenever I want.

35:31.754 --> 35:32.922
Exactly.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.012
Come on.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.306
Where?

35:46.602 --> 35:48.479
You won't pass if you don't practice.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.365
- Okay.
- Woo!

36:00.575 --> 36:01.659
Woo!

36:02.618 --> 36:04.036
Come on!

36:04.745 --> 36:05.830
Yeah!

36:08.958 --> 36:10.751
Woo-hoo!

36:13.129 --> 36:14.672
Woo-hoo!

36:25.266 --> 36:28.519
I don't think there's anyone else
who could've made me feel better today.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.274
There is no way that I was gonna let you
deal with all that alone.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.114
Do you ever wish we were still dating?

36:40.823 --> 36:43.242
Sure. Sometimes.

36:43.910 --> 36:44.911
But...

36:46.704 --> 36:48.831
you know that I...

36:48.915 --> 36:49.915
Right.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.043
God the Father disapproved.

36:54.170 --> 36:57.131
I do better when I feel good
about my choices.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.925
When they feel right.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.010
I know. I like that about you.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.097
But maybe someday we could get married.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.102
You'd have to join the church.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.271
I could do that.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.607
You should come with me.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.692
You'd like it.

37:17.902 --> 37:18.945
All right.

37:19.737 --> 37:20.737
Really?

37:21.739 --> 37:22.907
Yeah, sure.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.003
All right, uh,

37:36.754 --> 37:37.630
night.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.383
Night.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.871
Hi. I'm here.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.040
Hey. Hey, are you good?

38:13.416 --> 38:15.501
Becca told me it's been
kinda crazy around here.

38:15.751 --> 38:17.295
Yeah, I'm all right.

38:17.962 --> 38:18.962
Right on.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.630
Okay, good night.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.550
Oh, uh, hang on.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.759
This, uh...

38:25.219 --> 38:26.470
this came for you.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.278
What'cha got?

38:44.196 --> 38:45.531
Uh, I don't...

38:48.034 --> 38:49.034
Hmm.

38:50.619 --> 38:53.706
- What? Wh... wh... what is this?
- I think, uh...

38:54.749 --> 38:57.460
Shoot, I think it's a, uh,
criminal citation.

39:00.046 --> 39:01.047
What does that mean?

39:01.380 --> 39:02.631
I guess...

39:04.008 --> 39:09.138
Yeah, it says they're charging you
for something called "false reporting."

39:10.181 --> 39:11.223
Okay, um...

39:12.475 --> 39:16.437
but I... I... I... I never did
an... anything criminal ever.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.939
Yeah, don't freak out, okay?
We'll get this sorted out.

39:19.023 --> 39:20.709
I mean, it... it's too late
to do anything tonight.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.069
But first thing tomorrow,
we'll figure out what's going on.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.696
Okay, but I... I... I cannot be charged
with a crime.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.948
I mean, you... you said that
when I moved in.

39:28.032 --> 39:30.326
- I can't have any criminal charges.
- Marie, relax.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.347
- Does this mean I'm gonna get kicked out?
- No, we don't know what it means.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.413
Well, it might mean that.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.707
Marie, don't react
to what you don't know, okay?

39:36.791 --> 39:39.686
Right now, this is just something
we need a little more information about.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.710
That's all.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.253
Okay?

39:44.090 --> 39:45.090
Okay?

39:54.183 --> 39:55.684
She's condescending.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.271
That's just Rasmussen being Rasmussen.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.400
- You'll get used to it.
- I don't wanna get used to it.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.318
Maybe she should get used to me.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.986
I'll tell her you said that.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.320
Hey, Detective,
can you go easy on my wife, please?

40:09.156 --> 40:10.866
She's really sensitive.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.589
- Hey, easy, easy. Let me get that.
- Shit.

40:13.619 --> 40:16.455
- No, I'll get it.
- Ma'am, ma'am, back away from the sink.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.299
It's not her.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.593
I can handle her.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.513
It's the case.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.141
You don't say.

40:35.224 --> 40:38.477
Every lead's either a dead end,
or it's too thin to hold onto.

40:39.311 --> 40:42.857
The one thread we have,
the serial rapist angle,

40:42.940 --> 40:44.316
we only found by dumb luck.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.651
Don't knock dumb luck.

40:46.068 --> 40:48.988
Seriously, if you didn't
happen to work in Westminster

40:49.321 --> 40:52.867
and didn't happen to know the details
of Rasmussen's case,

40:53.159 --> 40:54.994
I might not have even found out.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.787
But you did. So...

41:01.417 --> 41:02.501
I gotta go.

41:11.135 --> 41:12.135
What?

41:15.723 --> 41:17.391
What if he knows that?

41:18.184 --> 41:19.602
What if who knows what?

41:20.686 --> 41:22.646
That stations don't talk to each other.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.026
That as long he only hits once
in each district,

41:27.651 --> 41:30.571
no one will ever know
they're chasing a serial rapist?

41:34.408 --> 41:35.993
- You're gonna be late.
- Gonna be late.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.411
Go. I'll figure it out.

41:38.829 --> 41:39.829
I love you.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.951
- Here's the thing.
- My God, woman.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.762
We're gonna have to get you
your own coffee mug.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.329
A guy that smart about DNA

42:20.412 --> 42:23.415
is probably smart about other aspects
of police procedure too.

42:23.999 --> 42:24.833
Like?

42:24.917 --> 42:27.545
Like, maybe he knows that when a case
gets entered into the CISC,

42:27.628 --> 42:30.464
it's just the basic data
that gets entered, it's not the details.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.674
Here, look.

42:36.011 --> 42:37.930
Oh, sorry, am I in your way?

42:38.013 --> 42:39.807
Just for instance,

42:41.141 --> 42:43.936
pulling up a random rape entry.

42:45.437 --> 42:49.483
You get the dispatch, case number,
lab reports, any arrests.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.861
Okay, well, believe it or not, I do happen
to know what CISC looks like.

42:52.945 --> 42:56.615
But hardly any investigative narrative.
No details, or not many.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.200
There's a tab for it here.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.035
Again, I am familiar.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.787
But how many officers do you know

43:01.870 --> 43:04.999
who take the time to fill out an A-plus
incident report in the first place,

43:05.082 --> 43:08.377
let alone go the extra mile
of actually typing it into CICS?

43:08.460 --> 43:10.963
Well, it... it depends.
I mean, for murder, maybe...

43:12.047 --> 43:13.090
half the time.

43:13.716 --> 43:14.883
Yeah, but for rape?

43:18.679 --> 43:19.679
Right.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.015
So...

43:23.642 --> 43:25.394
what if our guy knows that?

43:26.520 --> 43:29.940
Knows that the odds of a cop
in Westminster and a cop in Golden

43:30.190 --> 43:31.984
sharing specific evidence

43:32.067 --> 43:35.154
about their investigations
are pretty slim.

43:35.946 --> 43:40.492
And as long as he keeps moving, as long
as he never hits twice in the same town...

43:40.576 --> 43:43.370
You could have detectives
from eight different departments

43:43.454 --> 43:46.123
investigating eight identical rapes

43:46.624 --> 43:49.835
with no clue they're all chasing
the same guy.

43:51.211 --> 43:52.463
Exactly.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.385
Let me guess.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.156
Those are case numbers from every rape
that's happened in the county?

44:01.180 --> 44:02.180
State.

44:02.473 --> 44:05.476
Within the last three years?

44:05.559 --> 44:06.559
Five.

44:07.978 --> 44:10.064
Bitch, you are on your game.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.233
Okay, let's do this.

44:13.317 --> 44:15.819
Let's make some calls
and find some shit out.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.746
Hey, Detective,
Detective Duvall, Golden PD.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.539
I'm investigating a rape in my district.

44:27.623 --> 44:30.000
I'm hoping to get more information
about a case of yours.

44:30.084 --> 44:32.562
We're looking for cases
that might be the same perpetrator.

44:32.586 --> 44:35.047
I was hoping I could ask you
a couple of questions

44:35.130 --> 44:39.968
- about case number 1131-204.
- Morning.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.261
Uh-huh, sure.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.471
Morning.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.849
Well, good morning to you too.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.019
Yeah, sexual assault
from about nine months back.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.897
I was looking for some information
about a specific case number.

44:51.980 --> 44:55.025
One, one, three, five, dash...

44:55.109 --> 44:57.361
One, dash, one, one,
dash, three, zero, zero.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.696
One, one, dash...

44:58.946 --> 45:00.614
Yeah, rape/robbery.

45:02.324 --> 45:03.324
Uh-huh.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.452
- No?
- Thank you.

45:05.536 --> 45:06.536
No?

45:06.912 --> 45:09.039
- Okay. Yeah, thanks.
- Thank you.

45:10.666 --> 45:15.129
It's a rape case you investigated
about a year and a half ago.

45:17.464 --> 45:20.634
One, zero, six, six,
dash, six, two, three.

45:22.886 --> 45:24.930
Yeah. I will wait.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.393
Okay, thanks for your time.

45:35.733 --> 45:42.239
One, dash, zero, nine,
dash, six, three, four, four, zero, four.

45:45.492 --> 45:46.492
Yeah, I'll wait.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.122
Sorry, that wasn't in the database.

45:50.414 --> 45:53.625
No, good for you.
One less creep out there.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.305
Do you love me?

46:08.432 --> 46:09.433
I do.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.729
Yeah, this is Detective Rasmussen
from the Westminster PD.

46:14.646 --> 46:15.646
Yes, pl...

46:16.482 --> 46:18.734
Sure. I'd love to be put on hold.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.867
...you, Heavenly Father,
for this food.

46:21.945 --> 46:25.491
I love this family and thank you
for all the food we get. Amen.

46:25.574 --> 46:26.825
Amen.

46:29.203 --> 46:35.250
Yeah, it's, uh, it's 1-10-433300.

46:37.586 --> 46:40.881
Hi, Detective, this is Detective Duvall
from over in Golden.

46:50.766 --> 46:51.809
Hey.

46:54.645 --> 46:55.687
Is that her?

46:56.730 --> 46:58.232
Yeah.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.985
It kills me that I don't have anything
to tell her.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.488
No, we don't have him.

47:06.615 --> 47:10.118
No, sorry. No suspects.

47:11.703 --> 47:14.039
Leads? Nope, none of those either.

47:15.958 --> 47:17.042
No, all we know...

47:18.418 --> 47:20.337
is some anonymous man out there

47:20.921 --> 47:22.631
stole something from you...

47:23.715 --> 47:25.175
that you'll never get back.

47:26.552 --> 47:27.928
You and one other person.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.430
Mm, two.

47:32.808 --> 47:33.808
What?

47:35.143 --> 47:36.270
Two other people.

47:36.979 --> 47:38.647
I got a match. Aurora.

47:38.730 --> 47:42.484
Eighteen months ago.
Doris Laird, 72, a fraternity mother.

47:43.026 --> 47:46.029
Intruder, black mask. Backpack.
Tied her up. Took photos.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.793
Threatened to post them
if she told anyone.

47:47.823 --> 47:50.617
Made her shower.
Left a squeaky-clean crime scene.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.079
Six feet, 200 pounds.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.124
To date, has not been caught.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.042
- Holy mo.
- Mm-hmm.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.004
So, here's what we're gonna do.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.591
We're gonna merge our investigations.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.843
Today. Right now.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.344
You're gonna move over to my joint.

48:09.428 --> 48:11.430
It's no offense,
but we've got better toys.

48:11.513 --> 48:14.975
We're gonna bring in the FBI.
We're gonna bring in the CBI.

48:15.601 --> 48:19.104
We're gonna exploit every
goddamn resource available to us,

48:19.187 --> 48:21.398
and we're gonna find
that sick motherfucker.

48:21.481 --> 48:24.192
We're gonna find him and arrest him.

48:24.943 --> 48:26.063
And we're gonna put him away

48:26.111 --> 48:29.531
before he has a chance
to hurt someone else, which you know...

48:30.073 --> 48:33.201
<i>you know,</i> he is out there planning to do.
