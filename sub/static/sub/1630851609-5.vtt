09:59.381 --> 10:01.165
To be clear,
this is not a Toni story.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.124
All right? Just Tuna.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.429
But the two are connected.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.953
-Uh, where's the proof?
-Oh, my God.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.607
I'm finding it!

10:07.650 --> 10:09.304
I appreciate your blind
commitment to this woman, Beth.

10:09.347 --> 10:12.220
I mean, it's
journalistically irresponsible

10:12.263 --> 10:15.353
and sometimes hard to watch,
but it's very sweet.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.007
Wait, so you're canning it?

10:17.051 --> 10:19.227
No, it's just
on the back burner.

10:19.270 --> 10:22.578
So, Fiona walks into a building
and kills a guy,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.014
and she's a hero.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.842
What does Toni have to do
to get that superpower?

10:25.886 --> 10:27.888
Hey, I saved your life
that night.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.846
-I mean, sort of.
-Sort of?

10:29.890 --> 10:31.456
Are you, are you serious
right now?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.371
You were trapped
in a little room,

10:33.415 --> 10:37.680
crying, and I literally
swooped in and rescued you.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.900
-Okay. I wasn't crying.
-She was cr-- She was sobbing.

10:39.943 --> 10:43.164
-It was pathetic, okay?
-PIERRE: Wow. I can't believe

10:43.207 --> 10:45.427
you're actually fucking
turning on her after that.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.385
-I'm not turning on her.
-FIONA: Okay, you know what?

10:47.429 --> 10:50.345
I don't need this shit.
[sniffles]

10:50.388 --> 10:53.000
Okay. She's overreacting.
That's not normal.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.219
No, I just don't understand you.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.787
How could you do that
to sweet Fiona?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.702
She's a literal angel.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.356
Nice.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.280
[phone ringing, vibrating]

11:14.717 --> 11:16.023
Hello?

11:16.066 --> 11:17.633
Yeah, this is she.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.463
Yes, yeah, I did call you, um...

11:22.464 --> 11:24.074
Hi, um...

11:24.118 --> 11:25.554
As I mentioned in my voice mail,

11:25.597 --> 11:28.557
I was hoping to sit down
with one of your inmates.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.602
Charles Billingham.

11:30.646 --> 11:31.865
Yeah, that's right.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.128
Yeah, it's for a podcast.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.608
No, no. I-I know you're
a jail guard.

11:36.652 --> 11:37.871
It's just that, see, um,

11:37.914 --> 11:39.916
he doesn't have a publicist
listed online,

11:39.960 --> 11:43.398
so I was thinking--
Hello?

11:43.441 --> 11:44.965

11:45.008 --> 11:46.618

do have PTSD like you said.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.559

so I'd have to come with you.

with our steaks tonight?

of public opinion.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.471
Um, I am doing a podcast

14:23.514 --> 14:25.125
about your criminal enterprise,

14:25.168 --> 14:28.868
and I would love for you
to be a guest.

with you, Mr. Billingham.

Um...

15:05.556 --> 15:07.297
I just came from
the D.A.'s office,

15:07.341 --> 15:10.344
and it's-it's not looking good
for you.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.956
You're facing
multiple life sentences.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.917
But there is something
you can do to help yourself.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.440
Confess.

15:19.483 --> 15:22.834
Your sentence will be reduced,

Do you remember
Wallace Plimpton?

-All right, give me the...
-Stop it.

15:26.795 --> 15:29.145
Now, see,
the thing about Wallace is,

15:29.189 --> 15:30.973
his killer was never found.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.496
But that didn't stop the cops

15:32.540 --> 15:34.759
from throwing a young woman
into prison.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.718

a little girl,

15:36.761 --> 15:38.720
an orphan who's-who's
on the streets,

15:38.763 --> 15:41.810
all because the real killer
isn't man enough to confess

15:41.853 --> 15:43.725
-and take responsibility.
-Okay, that's enough.

15:43.768 --> 15:44.987

He was making moves,
you wanted him gone.

16:01.917 --> 16:03.963
I went to his funeral.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.877
I donated the flowers.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.619
I supplied the linen.

16:08.663 --> 16:12.362
I held his mom's hand
as we stood before his casket.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.538
Open casket, by the way,
if you can believe it.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.672

If I had killed him,

16:34.515 --> 16:37.257
there'd be no way
you could identify him.

16:38.345 --> 16:41.652
There'd be no body found.

No casket to cry over.

I didn't kill him.
