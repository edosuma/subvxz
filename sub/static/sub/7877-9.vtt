00:00.879 --> 00:02.312
(upbeat March plays)

00:02.380 --> 00:05.382
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:05.450 --> 00:09.086
¶ I got a feeling that it's
gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:09.154 --> 00:12.022
¶ the sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

00:12.090 --> 00:15.726
¶ and he's shining a salute
to the american race ¶

00:18.496 --> 00:21.198
¶ oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

00:21.266 --> 00:22.800
¶ good morning, usa ¶

00:22.867 --> 00:27.171
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:27.238 --> 00:29.873
¶ good morning, usa! ¶

00:29.941 --> 00:31.708
¶ ¶

00:35.280 --> 00:36.880
(sighs):
Come on, Francine,

00:36.948 --> 00:38.549
Don't make me late
for church again!

00:38.616 --> 00:40.951
God pays twice as much attention
on christmas.

00:41.019 --> 00:43.253
Like the media when a
white kid goes missing.

00:43.321 --> 00:46.356
Sorry, I was putting on
my new dress.

00:46.424 --> 00:48.425
I can't take you to god's
house like that!

00:48.493 --> 00:50.093
I can see your calves!

00:50.161 --> 00:51.728
You look like a
two-dollar whore!

00:51.796 --> 00:54.164
And keep in mind that the
dollar is weak right now.

00:54.232 --> 00:55.999
So, to wrap up, that's
an insult.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.368
See, at least Roger shows
the proper respect

00:58.436 --> 00:59.803
For this holiest
of days.

00:59.871 --> 01:01.338
Oh, I love
your religion.

01:01.406 --> 01:02.973
For the crazy!

01:03.041 --> 01:05.042
Virgin birth? Water into wine?

01:05.108 --> 01:06.910
<i>It's, it's like Harry Potter,</i>

01:06.978 --> 01:08.979
But it causes genocide
and bad folk music.

01:09.047 --> 01:10.781
Eh? Eh?

01:10.849 --> 01:12.850
(laughing):
Who-who am I nudging?

01:12.917 --> 01:14.651
There's no one next to me.

01:14.719 --> 01:17.654
(bells tolling)

01:17.722 --> 01:19.857
<i>Great. No spaces.</i>

01:19.924 --> 01:21.658
Thanks to the fair-weather
christians

01:21.726 --> 01:23.594
Who only show up on
christmas and easter.

01:23.661 --> 01:25.395
Well, we'll see how
fair the weather is

01:25.463 --> 01:27.297
When the rapture comes
and they're all left behind.

01:27.365 --> 01:28.932
Rapture? What's that?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.034
It's the first sign of
the end of the world,

01:31.102 --> 01:34.438
When all true christians like
myself ascend to heaven and...

01:34.505 --> 01:36.540
Ascend! You're flying now!

01:36.608 --> 01:38.008
(brakes screeching)
enough!

01:38.076 --> 01:40.811
You and the kids go find
seats while we park.

01:42.113 --> 01:43.413
I hope I haven't
missed the part

01:43.481 --> 01:45.182
Where the three Chinese
guys give perfume

01:45.250 --> 01:46.783
To the star baby.

01:46.851 --> 01:49.052
It's, it's like the diaries
of a madman!

01:49.120 --> 01:50.153
(laughing)

01:50.221 --> 01:51.722
¶ ¶

01:53.124 --> 01:55.025
¶ joy to the world ¶
damn!

01:55.093 --> 01:56.326
¶ the lord is come... ¶
no seats!

01:56.394 --> 01:59.263
I'm beset by phony christians!

02:00.531 --> 02:03.267
Stan, honey,
it's christmas, relax.

02:03.334 --> 02:04.635
I won't relax!

02:04.702 --> 02:06.637
I'm a better christian
than anyone in there.

02:06.704 --> 02:08.437
I'm the one who drives
by hebrew schools,

02:08.506 --> 02:10.374
Baptizing kids with
a super soaker

02:10.441 --> 02:12.009
Filled with garlic water.
(gasps)

02:12.076 --> 02:15.178
Here, I have an idea.

02:15.246 --> 02:17.247
We can't watch church
from here.

02:17.315 --> 02:19.650
This is where the slow
janitor lives.

02:19.717 --> 02:22.819
<i>It reeks of dead mice and moldy
highlights magazines.</i>

02:22.887 --> 02:25.155
Oh, I hate seeing
you stressed,

02:25.223 --> 02:28.058
So I'm gonna give you
your last present.

02:28.126 --> 02:29.593
Francine!

02:29.661 --> 02:31.528
We can't do this
in the house of the lord!

02:31.596 --> 02:33.463
This is wrong!
Then I've been
naughty,

02:33.531 --> 02:36.700
And you'll have to put
a big piece of coal

02:36.768 --> 02:38.235
In my stocking.

02:38.303 --> 02:39.469
(grunts)

02:39.537 --> 02:41.905
Damn your clumsy christmas
sex metaphors!

02:41.973 --> 02:43.307
(both moaning)

02:47.312 --> 02:48.779
Wow, thanks, francine.

02:48.846 --> 02:51.081
If you're wondering why I
lasted longer than usual,

02:51.149 --> 02:52.950
It's because I was focusing
on the dolls

02:53.017 --> 02:54.518
The janitor made out
of windex bottles

02:54.585 --> 02:56.353
And rat fur.

02:56.421 --> 02:57.688
Strange.

02:57.755 --> 02:59.256
I don't hear anything.

02:59.324 --> 03:00.090
(doors creaking)

03:01.292 --> 03:03.593
What's going on?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.028
(gasps):
Look!

03:08.933 --> 03:10.334
¶ gloria! ¶

03:11.736 --> 03:12.602
¶ gloria! ¶

03:14.906 --> 03:16.273
(gasps):
What's happening?!

03:16.341 --> 03:17.841
The rapture.

03:17.909 --> 03:19.910
Turns out
there is a god.

03:19.978 --> 03:23.513
¶ gloria! Gloria! ¶

03:23.581 --> 03:25.349
¶ ¶

03:29.020 --> 03:30.220
What?

03:30.288 --> 03:31.688
It can't be
the rapture!

03:31.756 --> 03:33.991
If this were the rapture,
I'd be floating up there!

03:34.058 --> 03:35.525
And so would
the slow janitor!

03:35.593 --> 03:37.961
Actually, I never
truly accepted jesus

03:38.029 --> 03:39.896
Into my heart.

03:39.964 --> 03:41.732
Mom!
Dad!

03:41.799 --> 03:43.700
Steve! Hayley!

03:43.768 --> 03:45.002
What's happening?!

03:45.069 --> 03:46.870
I was just about to do something
really funny!

03:46.938 --> 03:48.872
I'll tell you
what's happening.

03:48.940 --> 03:50.741
It's the end
of the world,

03:50.808 --> 03:52.609
And we've been
left behind!

03:52.677 --> 03:55.345
Oh, my god!

03:55.413 --> 03:58.281
The homeless guy
from the bus station is hung.

03:58.349 --> 04:00.017
But I knew that.

04:02.504 --> 04:04.571
Wait! There's been a
mistake! Lift me up, lord!

04:04.639 --> 04:06.440
Here, I'll help!

04:06.508 --> 04:08.442
Wait, hold on, this bible stuff
is real?!

04:08.510 --> 04:10.844
All right, somebody call
mel gibson and apologize.

04:10.912 --> 04:12.279
And then call tim robbins

04:12.347 --> 04:13.514
And tell him
I banged susan sarandon.

04:13.581 --> 04:14.748
He'll know what it means.

04:14.816 --> 04:16.750
Father donovan?!
What happens now?!

04:16.817 --> 04:18.918
Honestly, I have no clue.

04:18.987 --> 04:20.954
Luckily, I know an expert.

04:21.022 --> 04:22.222
Hey, kids!

04:22.290 --> 04:23.924
I'm ricky the raptor,

04:23.992 --> 04:26.226
Here to tell you
about the rapture!

04:26.294 --> 04:29.763
The rapture is the beginning
of the end of the world.

04:29.831 --> 04:31.665
It starts with all
true christians

04:31.733 --> 04:33.467
Floating up to heaven.

04:33.535 --> 04:35.836
What about the sinners
that are left behind?

04:35.904 --> 04:37.404
Well, jojo,

04:37.472 --> 04:40.941
They get to witness
the second coming of jesus.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.476
¶ ¶

04:42.544 --> 04:44.378
Jesus is coming back?

04:44.446 --> 04:45.979
Did he forget
something?

04:46.047 --> 04:48.315
Nope, jesus
is coming back

04:48.383 --> 04:50.384
For armageddon!

04:50.452 --> 04:53.353
(explosion)

04:53.421 --> 04:54.955
(yowling)

04:55.023 --> 04:57.958
<i>A seven-year war
where jesus and his angels</i>

04:58.026 --> 05:01.361
<i>Will battle demon soldiers
of the underworld!</i>

05:01.429 --> 05:04.498
<i>All leading up
to a final showdown</i>

05:04.566 --> 05:06.533
<i>Between jesus and
the antichrist!</i>

05:06.601 --> 05:07.868
<i>Jojo:
Antichrist?</i>

05:07.936 --> 05:09.970
<i>You mean that
green stuff</i>

05:10.038 --> 05:12.005
<i>That your daddy
puts in the car?</i>

05:12.073 --> 05:15.909
<i>(laughs):
No, silly,
that's antifreeze!</i>

05:15.977 --> 05:18.679
<i>The antichrist is
the son of satan!</i>

05:18.747 --> 05:20.547
<i>Well, who's
gonna win?!</i>

05:20.615 --> 05:22.316
<i>I don't know,</i>

05:22.383 --> 05:25.853
<i>But you sure don't want
to be around to find out!</i>

05:25.920 --> 05:28.355
(roaring)

05:28.423 --> 05:30.257
<i>Kid:
A christian kids production!</i>

05:30.325 --> 05:33.594
<i>Stay cool!</i>

05:33.661 --> 05:37.798
Hello? Yes, I need to charter
a helicopter asap!

05:37.866 --> 05:40.601
Uh, just about a mile up, and
then I'll grab on to someone.

05:40.668 --> 05:43.137
I can't imagine john goodman's
that high up yet.

05:43.204 --> 05:45.606
¶ ¶

05:45.673 --> 05:47.307
Okay, steve and
hayley smith,

05:47.375 --> 05:48.709
Your personal heavens
are ready.

05:48.777 --> 05:50.144
Personal heavens?

05:50.211 --> 05:53.514
Yeah, every saved soul gets
a personalized paradise

05:53.581 --> 05:55.449
Suited to their
individual tastes.

05:55.517 --> 05:57.484
Here you are, steve.

05:57.552 --> 05:59.386
Wait, there are
so many doors.

05:59.454 --> 06:01.288
How can you be sure
this is my heaven?

06:01.356 --> 06:03.190
(horse neighing)

06:07.362 --> 06:09.363
Pepper jack cheese.

06:09.430 --> 06:11.231
(chuckles):
It's my heaven.

06:12.834 --> 06:14.268
¶ ¶

06:19.040 --> 06:21.008
Authorities confirm the total
number of raptured

06:21.075 --> 06:22.943
At 142 million.

06:23.011 --> 06:24.845
You may notice my partner greg
isn't here.

06:24.913 --> 06:26.613
That's because he was raptured.

06:26.681 --> 06:29.616
Apparently god does love gays,
but only if they're tops.

06:29.684 --> 06:31.618
Well, if we're going
to be left behind,

06:31.686 --> 06:34.454
At least we're left
behind together.

06:34.522 --> 06:36.456
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:36.524 --> 06:37.958
What the hell,
francine?!

06:38.026 --> 06:39.626
I'm trying to rebuild
my spaceship

06:39.694 --> 06:41.061
So I can get off
this planet,

06:41.129 --> 06:42.529
But all my boxes
of spare parts

06:42.597 --> 06:44.431
Are full of hard rock café
sweatshirts!

06:44.499 --> 06:46.433
Oops. There must have
been a mix-up

06:46.501 --> 06:47.835
When I gave stuff
to goodwill.

06:47.902 --> 06:50.103
Oh, okay, well as long
as there's a good explanation!

06:50.171 --> 06:51.839
Didn't you hear
the puppets?!
(gagging)

06:51.906 --> 06:54.074
Demons are coming
to rape our skulls!

06:54.142 --> 06:55.409
Breaking news!

06:55.476 --> 06:57.511
The second coming
of jesus is here!

06:57.579 --> 06:59.613
Francine, shh!
I want to hear this!

06:59.681 --> 07:02.316
That's right, jesus has
returned to earth

07:02.383 --> 07:04.384
And tonight he'll be at the
langley falls civic arena

07:04.452 --> 07:05.786
Where he'll brief mankind

07:05.854 --> 07:07.621
On his upcoming battle
with the antichrist.

07:07.689 --> 07:08.822
That's it!

07:08.890 --> 07:10.123
We'll just go to jesus

07:10.191 --> 07:11.959
And explain there
was a mistake!

07:12.026 --> 07:14.761
(crowd cheering)

07:14.829 --> 07:16.797
Okay, the coast is clear.

07:17.999 --> 07:20.033
Yes?

07:20.101 --> 07:21.268
(whispering):
Stan.

07:21.336 --> 07:23.203
Oh, it's me, stan smith!

07:23.271 --> 07:25.472
I was supposed to be raptured
but there was a mistake!

07:25.540 --> 07:28.775
I'm sorry, stan,
but what's done is done.

07:28.843 --> 07:30.043
Wait!

07:30.111 --> 07:31.612
I know what this is about.

07:31.679 --> 07:33.513
It's because of the sex
in church, isn't it?

07:33.581 --> 07:35.515
Look, I didn't want to do it.
She seduced me!

07:35.583 --> 07:37.184
What?!
Please, jesus,

07:37.252 --> 07:40.053
Don't let her moral failings
screw me out of paradise!

07:40.121 --> 07:41.822
Moral failings?

07:41.890 --> 07:43.891
You think you're
better than me?

07:43.958 --> 07:46.960
Stan...
You're right.
What?

07:47.028 --> 07:48.929
That's why I'm going
to rapture him.

07:48.997 --> 07:49.963
Really?!

07:50.031 --> 07:51.965
Oh, jesus, you are the best!

07:52.033 --> 07:53.200
Later world!

07:53.268 --> 07:55.102
Smell my ass!

07:55.169 --> 07:57.504
Wait, you're just going
to abandon me here

07:57.572 --> 07:59.539
During armageddon?!

07:59.607 --> 08:00.807
Okay, look.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.676
I'll go up to heaven
and get a hand stamp.

08:02.744 --> 08:04.945
I'll come out, lick it and
press it against your hand.

08:05.013 --> 08:07.781
Boom, you're in, just like
that time at cabo wabo.

08:07.849 --> 08:08.982
Oh, wait,
that didn't work.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.717
You had to sit in the bus
all night.

08:10.785 --> 08:12.719
- Ah, it'll work this time.
- No, Stan.

08:12.787 --> 08:14.688
I wouldn't want to
get you in trouble

08:14.756 --> 08:16.690
And drag you
down again.

08:16.758 --> 08:20.027
In fact, you never have to
worry about that again,

08:20.094 --> 08:22.029
Because we're through!

08:22.096 --> 08:23.497
Oh, francine...

08:23.564 --> 08:26.133
No! Stan smith...

08:26.200 --> 08:26.833
(ring clinking)

08:26.901 --> 08:29.303
...Go to heaven!

08:29.370 --> 08:31.271
(sign buzzing)

08:35.576 --> 08:37.244
Both:
I'm sorry, go ahead.

08:37.312 --> 08:38.412
(both laugh):

08:38.479 --> 08:40.013
No, no, really.

08:40.081 --> 08:43.082
(laughing)

08:43.150 --> 08:45.452
I normally don't eat here
because of the murders,

08:45.520 --> 08:47.354
But it was right
next to the arena.

08:47.422 --> 08:49.389
(laughing)

08:49.457 --> 08:51.291
(both sigh)

08:53.761 --> 08:57.130
So, you went to the
jesus sermon, too.

08:57.198 --> 08:58.899
Did you go with
your boyfriend?

08:58.967 --> 09:00.634
I don't have a boyfriend.

09:00.702 --> 09:03.236
I had a husband,
but it's over.

09:03.304 --> 09:05.472
He... Left me.

09:05.540 --> 09:09.876
Well, I hope whatever
he left a woman like
you for is worth it.

09:11.179 --> 09:12.980
Okay, right here,
this is good.

09:13.047 --> 09:14.481
All right, jesus.

09:14.549 --> 09:16.316
Rapture me!

09:16.384 --> 09:18.285
Take off your clothes.

09:18.353 --> 09:21.088
Oh. I thought they
came off magically.

09:28.896 --> 09:31.665
You're not really
jesus, are you?

09:34.369 --> 09:35.669
Hi, goodwill?

09:35.737 --> 09:37.604
Yeah, I'm calling again
about my spaceship parts.

09:37.672 --> 09:39.506
Well, damn it, look again!

09:41.309 --> 09:43.276
Oh, hey, honey!
Good news!

09:43.344 --> 09:44.911
I told jesus not
to rapture me,

09:44.979 --> 09:47.280
Because I couldn't bear
to leave you behind.

09:47.348 --> 09:49.282
Nice try.

09:49.350 --> 09:50.684
You didn't get raptured

09:50.752 --> 09:52.619
Because that wasn't
the real jesus.

09:52.687 --> 09:54.187
It was just some phony

09:54.255 --> 09:56.823
Trying to take advantage
of desperate fools.

09:56.891 --> 09:58.825
(laughing):
Wha-wha-what?!

09:58.893 --> 10:01.528
Oh, next you'll say I let
him bend me over a dumpster

10:01.596 --> 10:02.763
Before I came
to my senses!

10:02.830 --> 10:04.297
You're too much, lady!

10:04.365 --> 10:07.234
I know, because
I found jesus, stan.

10:07.301 --> 10:09.636
The real jesus.

10:12.907 --> 10:19.046
¶ he turned water into fiiine! ¶

10:19.113 --> 10:22.015
You're...
The real jesus.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.417
Hi, stan.

10:23.484 --> 10:25.352
Jesus is back to spend
the next seven years

10:25.420 --> 10:27.287
Fighting the antichrist,

10:27.355 --> 10:29.156
And he asked me to
be his girlfriend.

10:29.223 --> 10:31.191
He can date this time.

10:31.259 --> 10:33.026
Can you believe it?

10:33.094 --> 10:35.962
Jesus thinks I'm good
enough for him.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.297
Good-bye, stan.

10:37.365 --> 10:39.232
Have a nice armageddon.

10:41.602 --> 10:43.670
(gasps)

10:43.738 --> 10:46.473
I dropped my meatball
in the pool.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:27.766 --> 11:29.633
Hello, stan.

11:32.103 --> 11:33.704
Well, well.

11:33.772 --> 11:36.106
What brings you to new denver,
commander jesus?

11:36.174 --> 11:38.041
Here on christmas vacation?

11:38.109 --> 11:39.243
That reminds me.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.044
I got you a birthday present.

11:45.016 --> 11:46.183
Ow!

11:46.251 --> 11:48.252
My other cheek!

11:48.319 --> 11:49.820
I need a job done,

11:49.888 --> 11:52.089
And you're the only
man who can do it.

11:52.157 --> 11:53.524
Forget it, nazarene.

11:53.591 --> 11:57.194
I stopped doing things for you
the day you stole my woman.

11:57.262 --> 11:58.762
Well, that's
just it, stan.

11:58.830 --> 12:00.631
Francine.

12:00.698 --> 12:02.466
The anti-christ
got her.

12:03.668 --> 12:05.502
(crow cawing)

12:14.479 --> 12:16.280
I don't know how
he got to her.

12:16.347 --> 12:18.148
It means
I can't trust anyone.

12:18.216 --> 12:19.449
Not even my generals.

12:19.517 --> 12:21.585
What makes you think
you can trust me?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.887
Because I know you've fought
against his kind.

12:23.955 --> 12:26.089
I fight for anyone who pays me.

12:26.157 --> 12:28.258
I also know you still love her.

12:28.326 --> 12:30.160
(scoffs)

12:31.696 --> 12:33.096
I'll do it.

12:33.164 --> 12:35.265
But not because of her.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.068
If I help you, you rapture me
off this you-forsaken rock.

12:38.136 --> 12:39.336
Deal?

12:40.972 --> 12:42.773
(engine revving)

12:51.349 --> 12:52.749
Anyone you knew?

12:52.817 --> 12:53.951
Yeah.

12:54.018 --> 12:55.719
He was my father's jester.

12:55.787 --> 12:57.521
Really funny dude.

12:57.589 --> 12:59.122
(shrieking)

12:59.190 --> 13:00.257
It's a trap!

13:00.325 --> 13:02.826
(screeching)

13:05.163 --> 13:06.363
(shrieks)

13:09.234 --> 13:11.869
(screams)

13:11.936 --> 13:13.837
(gasping groan)

13:15.940 --> 13:17.574
The open road is
too dangerous.

13:17.642 --> 13:19.743
Uh, what if we go
through sector 16?

13:19.811 --> 13:21.178
Sector 16?

13:21.246 --> 13:24.381
The perfect man just proposed
the perfect way to die.

13:24.449 --> 13:26.817
Fine. Then what
about sector 35?

13:26.885 --> 13:30.787
(scoffs)
sector 35 makes sector
16 look like sector 48.

13:30.855 --> 13:32.923
Okay, then what do
you propose we do?

13:38.029 --> 13:40.530
I know someone who
might be able to help.

13:40.598 --> 13:42.132
(mechanical hissing
and whirring)

13:44.435 --> 13:46.136
Okay, qui-lo, hit it!

13:46.204 --> 13:49.206
(high-pitched whirring,
sputtering)

13:49.274 --> 13:51.074
(yells)
damn it!

13:52.243 --> 13:53.610
Wait!

13:53.678 --> 13:55.312
No wonder this isn't working!

13:55.380 --> 13:57.915
The stone waterfall goes
in my career corner,

13:57.982 --> 14:00.083
And the orchid goes
in my wealth corner.

14:00.151 --> 14:01.451
(speaking foreign language)

14:01.519 --> 14:03.453
(both speaking
foreign language)

14:05.957 --> 14:07.391
Stan:
Lovers' quarrel?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.026
Well, well.

14:09.093 --> 14:11.728
I always knew you'd breeze back
through my door.

14:11.796 --> 14:13.864
Roger,
meet jesus.

14:13.932 --> 14:15.966
Ah, an alien.

14:16.034 --> 14:17.901
One of my father's
side projects.

14:17.969 --> 14:19.069
You'd better watch
your mouth!

14:19.137 --> 14:20.103
(grunting)

14:20.171 --> 14:21.505
Whoa, whoa.

14:21.572 --> 14:22.739
We need
to book passage

14:22.807 --> 14:24.408
On your ship
to the far outlands.

14:24.475 --> 14:25.809
Good luck.

14:25.877 --> 14:28.111
The ship's subfusion engines run
on precious metals

14:28.179 --> 14:29.479
And crystallined minerals.

14:29.547 --> 14:31.949
So unless you can poop out
gem-encrusted gold,

14:32.016 --> 14:33.317
You're out of luck.

14:33.384 --> 14:36.053
When my army laid siege

14:36.120 --> 14:39.056
At the battle of boca raton,
they found this.

14:55.306 --> 14:57.774
(screaming)

14:57.842 --> 15:00.644
Okay, I'll drop you off at
the lair of the anti-christ,

15:00.712 --> 15:02.612
And then armageddon
out of here!

15:02.680 --> 15:04.614
(laughs)

15:04.682 --> 15:05.949
Oh, that's good.

15:06.017 --> 15:07.451
I got to write
that one down.

15:07.518 --> 15:10.153
(all yelling)

15:15.193 --> 15:16.393
(beeps)

15:16.461 --> 15:18.061
Come on, start!

15:18.129 --> 15:19.863
Thanks for the ride,
otherworlder.

15:19.931 --> 15:21.064
Wait! Jesus!

15:21.132 --> 15:22.299
I'm still stuck here!

15:22.367 --> 15:24.668
Can't you just send me
to heaven?!

15:24.736 --> 15:25.936
I can't do that.

15:26.004 --> 15:27.871
But I can offer you
something else.

15:27.939 --> 15:29.473
After I defeat
the anti-christ,

15:29.540 --> 15:32.175
I'm to begin the long road
of rebuilding civilization.

15:32.243 --> 15:35.946
It's going to be a lot of work,
and I could use your help.

15:36.014 --> 15:38.115
That's okay.

15:38.182 --> 15:41.018
(anomalous beeps)

15:43.621 --> 15:44.788
(elevator bell dings)

15:56.367 --> 15:59.069
By the way, what does the
anti-christ look like?

15:59.137 --> 16:02.539
Believe me, you'll know him
when you see him.

16:02.607 --> 16:03.774
(elevator bell dings)

16:08.780 --> 16:09.813
Oh!

16:09.881 --> 16:11.681
What did you do that for?!

16:11.749 --> 16:13.050
That was the anti-christ!

16:13.117 --> 16:15.685
No! There's a prep school
two blocks away.

16:15.753 --> 16:18.321
Sometimes the kids
come in here and play.

16:18.389 --> 16:20.724
Then I guess
I just picked a whole bouquet

16:20.792 --> 16:22.659
Of oopsie-daisies.

16:31.135 --> 16:33.336
(chuffing)

16:36.040 --> 16:39.176
This is it, the lair
of the anti-christ,

16:39.243 --> 16:42.312
Where everything's
anti-me.

16:42.380 --> 16:45.248
(muffled cries)

16:45.316 --> 16:46.483
Francine!

16:46.551 --> 16:48.552
(muffled protests)

16:48.619 --> 16:50.887
Kneel before
the lord, punk.

16:56.794 --> 16:58.462
(sighs)

16:58.529 --> 16:59.963
Oh, stan!

17:00.031 --> 17:01.698
Don't get any
ideas, doll.

17:01.766 --> 17:03.300
I'm just in this
for the rapture.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.601
Right.

17:04.669 --> 17:06.569
The only thing
you ever cared about.

17:09.173 --> 17:11.108
Hello, darling.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.042
Leave the heartwarming
reunion for later.

17:14.679 --> 17:16.346
Man:
Sorry, do-gooders!

17:16.414 --> 17:18.013
(cackling)

17:18.082 --> 17:19.648
The anti-christ!

17:19.717 --> 17:21.885
Condemn them, mother,

17:21.953 --> 17:24.921
For they know exactly
what they do!

17:27.090 --> 17:28.925
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.

17:28.993 --> 17:30.327
What-what does
that mean?

17:30.394 --> 17:32.295
You know,
it's the opposite of,

17:32.363 --> 17:36.032
"forgive them, father,
for they know not what they do."

17:36.100 --> 17:37.567
Hello?!

17:37.635 --> 17:38.969
I'm the anti-christ.

17:39.036 --> 17:41.705
I'm the opposite
of jesus in every way!

17:41.772 --> 17:42.973
(laughs)

17:43.040 --> 17:44.608
Anti, get us out
of this thing!

17:44.675 --> 17:45.775
(deep rumbling)

17:45.843 --> 17:47.511
Well, jesus,

17:47.578 --> 17:49.446
You can walk
on water, eh?!

17:49.514 --> 17:52.048
Let's see if you
can swim in land!

17:52.116 --> 17:54.417
(cackling)

17:56.120 --> 17:57.954
(screaming)

18:02.026 --> 18:03.593
Huh?

18:03.661 --> 18:05.128
I built that! See?!

18:05.196 --> 18:06.463
You were
a carpenter!

18:06.531 --> 18:08.365
I'm not handy
at all!

18:08.432 --> 18:10.634
(cackling)

18:12.270 --> 18:14.905
We're pinned down!

18:19.911 --> 18:21.811
(grunting)

18:21.879 --> 18:23.980
It's raining
wise men.

18:24.048 --> 18:25.615
Hallelujah.

18:25.683 --> 18:26.783
(laughs)

18:32.657 --> 18:34.424
(grunting and choking)

18:34.492 --> 18:36.393
(yelling)

18:38.029 --> 18:39.596
You should have known, anti.

18:39.664 --> 18:41.598
With me...

18:41.666 --> 18:43.500
The thighs the limit.

18:45.836 --> 18:48.038
(weak laugh)
funny.

18:48.105 --> 18:50.006
Stan, what are you doing?
(beeping)

18:50.074 --> 18:51.341
In one minute,

18:51.409 --> 18:54.144
This place is gonna be
blown to kingdom come.

18:54.212 --> 18:57.781
Thou shalt not not kill!

19:00.318 --> 19:01.151
(grunts)

19:02.353 --> 19:03.386
(screams)

19:04.555 --> 19:05.322
(grunts)

19:05.389 --> 19:08.525
(shrieks)

19:08.593 --> 19:10.727
Later world!

19:10.795 --> 19:12.329
Smell my ass!

19:12.396 --> 19:14.598
(gasping groan)

19:14.665 --> 19:15.932
Stan!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.300
Why, stan?

19:17.368 --> 19:19.336
Why did you take
the bullet for me?

19:19.403 --> 19:21.805
For the same
reason I came here.

19:21.872 --> 19:23.273
For her.

19:25.409 --> 19:27.544
Francine,
I was wrong

19:27.612 --> 19:29.813
To ever think I was
better than you.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.916
I wish I could go back
and change the man I was.

19:32.984 --> 19:35.619
You're the best, so
you deserve the best.

19:35.686 --> 19:38.655
You deserve...
fancy feast.

19:38.723 --> 19:39.856
What?

19:39.924 --> 19:41.091
Sorry. I mean jesus.

19:41.158 --> 19:42.325
You deserve jesus.

19:42.393 --> 19:43.727
I'm kind of
bleeding out here.

19:43.794 --> 19:45.362
Here, let me help you.

19:46.897 --> 19:49.165
Our wedding rings.

19:49.233 --> 19:50.166
Now go!

19:50.234 --> 19:51.401
Both of you!

19:51.469 --> 19:52.669
This place is
gonna blow!

19:52.737 --> 19:53.937
No, Stan!

19:54.005 --> 19:55.305
I can't leave you behind!

19:55.373 --> 19:56.906
I know you can't.

19:58.276 --> 19:59.476
Get her out of here!

19:59.543 --> 20:01.278
Stan, at least
let me rapture you.

20:01.345 --> 20:02.579
There's no time!

20:02.647 --> 20:03.880
The spell takes too long!

20:03.948 --> 20:05.782
- He's right.
- Go!

20:05.850 --> 20:07.717
Mm.

20:09.887 --> 20:11.721
(sobbing)

20:13.157 --> 20:14.991
(beeping)

20:21.999 --> 20:24.901
Merry christmas,
Mr. and Mrs. Jesus.

20:24.969 --> 20:26.836
(rapid beeping)

20:28.272 --> 20:30.106
(explosion)

20:33.778 --> 20:36.413
Well, here we are.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.949
I always imagined I'd spend
eternity with Francine.

20:40.017 --> 20:42.018
Stan, this is
your personal heaven.

20:42.086 --> 20:45.221
It is what your heart
most desires.

20:47.792 --> 20:48.925
(rumbling)
