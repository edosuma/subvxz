00:12.888 --> 00:17.559
Ju-on: The curse of one who dies
in the grip of powerful rage.

00:17.601 --> 00:22.314
It gathers and takes effect in
the places that person was alive.

00:22.397 --> 00:27.069
Those who encounter it die,
and a new curse is born.

01:07.401 --> 01:14.616
The Grudge

01:16.952 --> 01:21.665
Rika

01:22.833 --> 01:26.628
Social Welfare Center

01:45.814 --> 01:47.399
I'm back.

01:47.524 --> 01:48.525
Hello.

01:48.775 --> 01:53.572
Write your name and the time
in here, please.

01:53.697 --> 01:55.032
All right.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.415
There.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.750
Thanks.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.463
Rika!

02:10.672 --> 02:12.382
It's this.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.385
What? By myself?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.888
There's no one else around.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.515
But...

02:23.227 --> 02:25.896
Whose case is it?

02:26.104 --> 02:29.358
I can't reach him.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.237
He took the key and left,
and hasn't come back.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.574
I'm just a volunteer...

02:37.741 --> 02:40.869
That's all right.
You're used to this.

02:40.953 --> 02:41.912
Mr Hirohashi...

02:42.120 --> 02:44.540
Mr Goto's looking for you.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.166
Goto?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.797
Would you do it?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.173
Just look in on her.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.550
But...

02:54.591 --> 02:56.969
I'll buy you dinner.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.888
You don't have to...

03:49.313 --> 03:52.608
Tokunaga

04:17.798 --> 04:19.635
Hello?

04:33.690 --> 04:35.567
Hello!

04:50.916 --> 04:54.378
I'm from the Welfare Center...

05:05.848 --> 05:07.724
May I come in?

05:35.627 --> 05:38.881
Are you all right?!

06:24.885 --> 06:27.804
You're Sachie, right?

06:29.181 --> 06:34.686
I'm here to help out
in place of Mr Takahashi.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.397
I'm Nishina Rika.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.351
Come on...

10:43.143 --> 10:44.686
Come here...

10:52.277 --> 10:53.278
Sachie!

10:53.570 --> 10:57.032
Who's that boy upstairs?!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.952
Sachie!

11:17.052 --> 11:20.097
He was shut in a closet!

11:21.056 --> 11:24.142
You didn't say anything
about a child.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.981
Yes. He's still upstairs.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.066
Yes.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.028
I told you, they aren't home yet!

11:36.613 --> 11:38.073
Yes.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.367
But...

11:42.286 --> 11:43.412
Yes.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.206
All right.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.667
Yes.

12:03.140 --> 12:08.770
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.525
Hello? It's Hitomi.

12:14.651 --> 12:18.155
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

12:20.157 --> 12:22.659
How's Mom getting along?

12:25.162 --> 12:30.250
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.174
Um, what's your name?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.762
Toshio.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.766
Yeah? 'Toshio'...

13:28.684 --> 13:31.353
My name's...

13:31.395 --> 13:33.689
I told her.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.623
Sachie?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.251
I told her.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.254
I told Kazumi.

13:57.754 --> 14:02.718
I told her again and again.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.763
I told her again and again.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.141
What's the matter?

14:10.267 --> 14:14.188
Why don't you lie down, OK?

14:14.479 --> 14:18.358
Again and again, I told her.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.863
Just the way you said to.

14:23.280 --> 14:27.159
Please stop tormenting me.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.708
Sachie...

15:10.661 --> 15:15.624
Katsuya

16:15.267 --> 16:17.019
Morning.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.528
Mom sure sleeps late these days.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.698
That's 'cause she's up all night.

16:30.449 --> 16:31.950
Every night.

16:32.284 --> 16:36.497
I'm sure it's fine for someone
who can sleep through anything.

16:42.586 --> 16:45.464
Maybe it was the move.

16:50.427 --> 16:54.723
I'll talk to the helper.
We're paying for him, after all.

16:55.015 --> 16:59.228
That won't help. Your mother's
always nice with other people.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.397
OK, OK. Try to get along, will you?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.401
You'll be home early?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.655
Your sister's coming!

17:12.574 --> 17:14.535
You forgot!

17:14.660 --> 17:17.162
Is it Friday already?

17:17.329 --> 17:19.455
Get it together.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.416
Hurry home.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.586
OK. See you.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.293
Oh, Mother!

18:04.585 --> 18:08.463
Just tell me if you want something!

19:15.572 --> 19:16.907
Who's that?

19:17.741 --> 19:19.576
Who's there?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.044
I'm home!

20:14.673 --> 20:16.633
Is Hitomi here?

20:20.762 --> 20:22.097
Kazumi?

20:31.231 --> 20:32.524
Mom?

20:41.617 --> 20:43.785
Where's Kazumi?

20:47.915 --> 20:49.124
Mom?

21:15.150 --> 21:17.569
Where is she?!

21:18.153 --> 21:19.613
Kazumi!

21:21.990 --> 21:23.033
Kazumi?

21:25.911 --> 21:28.288
Are you here?

21:39.091 --> 21:40.050
Kazumi?

21:40.717 --> 21:41.593
Kazumi!

21:42.052 --> 21:44.012
Hey! Kazumi!

21:46.014 --> 21:47.349
Kazumi!

21:48.100 --> 21:49.351
Kazumi!

21:49.726 --> 21:51.019
Hey! Kazumi!

21:55.816 --> 21:58.861
What's wrong? What happened?

22:02.698 --> 22:03.782
What?

22:07.161 --> 22:10.706
Hang on. I'll call an ambulance.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.723
What are you doing here?!

24:14.371 --> 24:15.539
Kazumi!

24:50.908 --> 24:52.868
Hello!

25:02.336 --> 25:06.006
Hello? I'm here!

25:06.965 --> 25:08.425
Kazumi?

25:09.468 --> 25:10.802
Kazumi?

25:28.946 --> 25:32.366
Hi, Mom. How are you?

25:45.629 --> 25:47.840
Where's Kazumi?

25:54.888 --> 25:58.892
I'll start getting dinner ready.

26:38.599 --> 26:41.977
Kazumi? Is that you?

26:44.521 --> 26:46.190
Katsuya?

27:04.208 --> 27:08.045
Don't scare me like that!

27:10.255 --> 27:12.382
Where's Kazumi?

27:14.301 --> 27:19.223
Kazumi went out. Something came up.

27:20.349 --> 27:26.230
She's not shopping?
She'll be back soon, won't she?

27:32.611 --> 27:38.075
I'm sorry, Hitomi.
This isn't a very good time.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.202
What's going on?

27:41.954 --> 27:43.914
Did something happen?

27:43.956 --> 27:45.624
She had another man.

27:45.707 --> 27:46.708
What?!

27:47.084 --> 27:50.504
She deceived me!

27:51.046 --> 27:55.259
That's not my child.
That's not my child.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.761
What are you talking about?!

28:01.223 --> 28:04.560
Look, just go away, OK?

28:07.104 --> 28:09.439
Are you feeling all right?

28:09.523 --> 28:13.610
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone for a while.

29:18.091 --> 29:22.471
Hitomi

29:26.391 --> 29:32.105
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.610
Hello? It's Hitomi.

29:38.529 --> 29:41.865
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

29:43.867 --> 29:46.787
How's Mom getting along?

29:48.705 --> 29:53.502
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

30:57.149 --> 30:59.902
Tokunaga Katsuya

31:00.694 --> 31:05.407
Hello, Katsuya?
I just called your house.

31:07.409 --> 31:09.953
Hello? Katsuya?

31:13.248 --> 31:16.543
Look, this isn't funny!

31:22.883 --> 31:25.761
Sorry. I just hung up.

31:33.602 --> 31:35.229
Who's there?

31:59.795 --> 32:02.005
The 5th-floor Ladies'?

32:02.214 --> 32:03.257
Yes.

32:04.341 --> 32:07.469
I'll go take a look.

32:07.845 --> 32:09.972
You wait here.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.431
Excuse me!

35:11.195 --> 35:12.070
Yes?

35:12.154 --> 35:13.822
Hello? It's me.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.032
Katsuya?

35:15.157 --> 35:19.411
I'm out front of your building.
What number were you?

35:19.578 --> 35:23.540
702! Hurry, will you?

35:40.933 --> 35:41.975
Katsuya!

36:46.790 --> 36:51.253
...also a house bat,
a pygmy woodpecker...

36:51.503 --> 36:57.593
...wild birds not seen here before,
a blue-green snake...

36:57.801 --> 37:03.557
...among 54 discoveries, including
a 2.5- Meter discarded snakeskin...

38:16.213 --> 38:20.676
Toyama

38:49.746 --> 38:51.206
Hello?

38:55.669 --> 38:57.171
Hello?

39:00.257 --> 39:01.925
Missus?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.220
Missus?

39:27.701 --> 39:28.911
Rika?

39:30.954 --> 39:32.080
Rika?

39:38.795 --> 39:40.255
Rika!

39:40.881 --> 39:42.758
Rika!

40:03.987 --> 40:05.781
Mr Nakagawa...

40:08.492 --> 40:10.118
Dial him.

41:11.847 --> 41:13.515
Up there.

41:41.919 --> 41:43.378
Rika...

41:46.256 --> 41:47.591
Rika!

41:50.052 --> 41:51.845
Are you OK?

41:53.430 --> 41:56.850
Yeah. Sorry, Mariko.

41:56.934 --> 41:59.561
You're missing school.

41:59.645 --> 42:03.607
That's OK.
I've got all the credits I need.

42:05.317 --> 42:08.821
Anyway, what happened?

42:10.280 --> 42:14.910
I don't really understand
that myself.

42:16.954 --> 42:20.916
Was Hirohashi bugging you
to do something again?

42:21.083 --> 42:23.126
And you couldn't say no?

42:24.920 --> 42:28.215
You're supposed to be
the care-giver!

42:29.174 --> 42:31.844
I'm glad you came.

42:32.636 --> 42:34.596
I'll go buy a drink.

42:46.984 --> 42:50.320
So that was the first time
you'd been there?

42:50.404 --> 42:52.865
Yes, it was.

42:53.448 --> 42:58.912
About the child
you say you saw there...

43:00.414 --> 43:03.292
Did you find him?

43:03.500 --> 43:07.171
No... not yet.

43:12.926 --> 43:14.928
'Toshio'...

43:16.889 --> 43:20.642
He said his name was Toshio.

43:20.684 --> 43:22.060
Toshio?

43:28.025 --> 43:33.947
Ms Nishina, the Tokunagas
don't have any children.

43:34.031 --> 43:35.407
What?

43:35.491 --> 43:41.079
What about that photograph?

43:41.163 --> 43:43.916
There was a family picture
in the house.

43:45.042 --> 43:50.297
That wasn't the Tokunagas.

43:50.714 --> 43:53.300
Then who was it?

43:53.967 --> 43:57.095
We're looking into that.

44:00.724 --> 44:02.518
Detective...

44:05.062 --> 44:07.606
What happened there?

44:18.158 --> 44:19.409
Excuse me.

44:31.588 --> 44:38.011
The families before the Tokunagas
all died or disappeared, too.

44:39.096 --> 44:41.431
Is this all of them?

44:45.435 --> 44:48.438
What about the sister?

44:48.981 --> 44:51.024
We can't find her.

44:51.275 --> 44:55.404
A security guard
where she works is dead, too.

44:57.114 --> 44:58.574
And...

45:00.117 --> 45:01.410
...look at this.

45:06.707 --> 45:11.086
A man named Saeki Takeo
killed his wife Kayako there.

45:11.128 --> 45:16.592
Later he was found dead
on the road by a neighbor.

45:20.053 --> 45:24.349
Saeki Kayako, 28, housewife.

45:26.435 --> 45:30.355
She and Takeo had a son.

45:38.739 --> 45:41.450
'Toshio'...

45:51.585 --> 45:55.297
Kayako's body was found...

45:58.133 --> 46:01.803
...up there under the roof.

46:28.413 --> 46:30.374
Hi, Daddy!

46:30.457 --> 46:32.000
Hi, Izumi. Where's Mom?

46:32.084 --> 46:33.335
Shopping.

46:33.585 --> 46:35.712
She'll be angry again
if you don't get home.

46:35.796 --> 46:37.840
It's OK. Come over here.

46:38.131 --> 46:39.132
Why?

46:39.216 --> 46:40.676
Come on!

46:41.718 --> 46:42.511
Quick!

46:42.553 --> 46:44.137
What is it?

46:45.389 --> 46:46.974
Look at this.

46:47.099 --> 46:49.351
Did you draw those?

46:49.434 --> 46:50.602
Yep!

46:50.894 --> 46:54.690
This is the Prince of Heaven.

46:55.107 --> 46:57.651
That's the Princess.

46:58.277 --> 47:02.239
And that's their baby.

47:02.406 --> 47:04.741
Yeah? And who's this?

47:09.580 --> 47:14.251
Mr Toyama Yuji? Lgarashi,
Yahara Division.

47:16.712 --> 47:17.671
Ow!

47:21.216 --> 47:22.676
What is it?

47:23.594 --> 47:28.265
You were in charge of the
Saeki investigation.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.893
I'd like to talk to you.

47:34.271 --> 47:37.232
Izumi, you get on home.

47:49.745 --> 47:54.291
I quit the force.
Leave me alone, will you?

47:54.958 --> 47:58.253
Two more people have died there.

48:03.300 --> 48:08.430
You're the only one left
who was involved with the case.

48:14.645 --> 48:17.773
Izumi! What are you doing there?

48:17.981 --> 48:22.861
Did you clean the bath?
It's your turn today, you know.

48:23.362 --> 48:25.405
Get going.

48:30.202 --> 48:34.748
Was this the boy you saw
at the Tokunaga house?

48:37.251 --> 48:38.293
Yes.

48:39.920 --> 48:42.297
Take a good look.

48:44.842 --> 48:47.344
You're sure?

48:47.845 --> 48:51.640
Yes, it was him. Did you find him?

48:51.682 --> 48:52.850
No.

48:52.975 --> 48:59.273
He went missing five years ago.
He's never been found.

49:00.566 --> 49:06.613
Even if he were alive somewhere,
he'd be 11 years old.

49:24.631 --> 49:25.883
Huh?

50:07.424 --> 50:08.926
Mr Nakagawa...

50:09.510 --> 50:11.887
This is Toyama Yuji.

50:12.513 --> 50:14.890
He was on that case.

50:15.599 --> 50:17.017
Thank you.

50:21.313 --> 50:24.441
My name's Nakagawa. Come in.

50:38.497 --> 50:43.418
Tokunaga Hitomi. Her elder brother
Katsuya lived in that house.

50:43.502 --> 50:46.588
She went home, then disappeared.

50:46.797 --> 50:50.008
Someone in her building
saw her come home.

50:58.141 --> 51:01.562
They found Hirohashi's body.

51:02.479 --> 51:06.567
The man who found Rika is dead.

51:06.650 --> 51:07.693
Mr. Toyama.

51:07.818 --> 51:10.154
Would you excuse me a minute,
please?

54:44.701 --> 54:47.120
Lzumi, you're chicken!

54:47.162 --> 54:48.455
What's that?

54:48.580 --> 54:50.624
Sake.

54:50.833 --> 54:53.043
What's that doing here?

54:54.962 --> 54:58.674
Saori, you pig!

54:59.383 --> 55:02.594
That's not sake.

55:06.890 --> 55:08.183
I'm leaving!

55:08.267 --> 55:10.644
Wait! It's OK!

55:10.727 --> 55:11.854
Are you running out?

55:11.895 --> 55:12.980
Lzumi!

55:30.080 --> 55:32.749
What a suck!

55:32.916 --> 55:38.005
She's always like that.

55:42.968 --> 55:45.345
Yeah, and I heard...

55:45.429 --> 55:47.723
...now she hangs with Chiharu.

55:55.647 --> 56:00.110
He hasn't come home.
Where could he be?

56:02.321 --> 56:05.741
Well? She's gone, you know.

56:05.782 --> 56:07.743
Can you believe that!

56:07.826 --> 56:10.245
Ayano, check out the window.

56:11.788 --> 56:14.041
She's there.

56:14.249 --> 56:18.337
She's by the gate.
It looks like she's thinking.

56:18.462 --> 56:20.589
Why's she so scared?

56:20.714 --> 56:23.217
Maybe she's got ESP.

56:23.342 --> 56:26.261
She didn't have to leave!

56:26.720 --> 56:28.722
I'm cold.

56:28.972 --> 56:30.807
Yeah.

56:31.016 --> 56:33.101
What was that?

56:33.185 --> 56:34.061
What's wrong?

56:34.144 --> 56:36.063
Lzumi's gone!

56:38.440 --> 56:39.691
What?

57:16.145 --> 57:18.188
Mr Toyama!

57:19.189 --> 57:20.983
Mr Nakagawa!

57:21.066 --> 57:22.818
Mr Toyama!

57:22.901 --> 57:24.903
Please!

57:24.987 --> 57:26.822
Get a grip!

57:26.947 --> 57:28.991
What happened?!

57:58.812 --> 58:03.192
Lzumi

58:03.942 --> 58:05.402
What's 1 st period?

58:05.486 --> 58:06.862
English?

58:06.904 --> 58:08.780
Mr Sekine!

58:09.072 --> 58:10.199
Oh, yuck!

58:10.407 --> 58:12.075
His English is weird!

58:12.159 --> 58:13.118
Yeah!

58:13.202 --> 58:15.871
It doesn't sound like
any English I've heard.

58:15.913 --> 58:18.332
Do foreigners understand him?

58:18.373 --> 58:20.834
He probably can't speak it!

58:22.085 --> 58:25.881
Yeah, but he's teaching it to us!

58:28.926 --> 58:30.010
Lzumi?

58:30.844 --> 58:32.262
Lzumi?

58:35.516 --> 58:36.391
What's wrong?

58:36.475 --> 58:37.559
Nothing.

58:39.019 --> 58:42.231
Missing

58:48.904 --> 58:50.823
Isn't she Izumi?

58:51.323 --> 58:52.866
She is not.

58:54.409 --> 58:55.911
Find one?

58:55.953 --> 58:57.120
Not yet.

59:15.472 --> 59:17.057
'Bye.

59:19.268 --> 59:20.310
Mr Sekine!

59:20.602 --> 59:22.062
What's up?

59:23.605 --> 59:26.358
Toyama? What's wrong?

59:28.152 --> 59:31.446
There's no picture of Izumi.

59:31.488 --> 59:33.073
Why not?

59:33.907 --> 59:36.243
That shouldn't be. Did you look?

59:36.326 --> 59:37.369
There isn't.

59:37.452 --> 59:39.788
We looked and looked and looked!

59:39.872 --> 59:40.914
I see.

59:41.456 --> 59:45.085
OK, I'll check the negatives.
Can you wait a while?

59:46.378 --> 59:47.296
'Bye.

59:47.588 --> 59:49.298
How long?!

59:49.381 --> 59:52.426
Don't pull!
You'll stretch my sweater!

59:52.467 --> 59:54.052
Within a week.

59:54.136 --> 59:55.971
Why a week?!

59:56.013 --> 59:57.514
I'm a busy man!

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:34.218
A woman's body has been found
in an empty house in Nerima ward.

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:39.139
Nishina Rika,
a 23 year-old social worker...

01:00:39.223 --> 01:00:43.936
...had been listed as missing.
No marks were found on the body.

01:01:53.088 --> 01:01:54.214
Thank you.

01:01:57.759 --> 01:01:59.553
Finally!

01:01:59.595 --> 01:02:01.555
It's not my fault!

01:02:01.597 --> 01:02:04.349
We're going to Izumi's.

01:02:04.433 --> 01:02:07.311
OK, I'll come with you.

01:02:07.394 --> 01:02:08.228
Hey!

01:02:08.312 --> 01:02:09.688
No, thanks. 'Bye.

01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:11.982
We'll bring them back tomorrow.

01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:14.109
Talk to Toyama for me!

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:16.111
Let me see!

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:17.237
No!

01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:19.072
We'll see them with Izumi.

01:02:19.156 --> 01:02:21.492
But I want to see them!

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:40.677
You're Izumi's friends?

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:50.604
Lzumi? It's Chiharu and Miyuki.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.191
We brought the pictures.

01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:08.080
Can we come in?

01:03:28.392 --> 01:03:32.563
Isn't it a bit dark in here?

01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:36.900
Don't!

01:03:58.297 --> 01:03:59.590
Lzumi?

01:04:00.883 --> 01:04:02.301
What's wrong?

01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:05.762
Lzumi?

01:04:09.141 --> 01:04:13.437
The three of them are looking in...

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:17.483
...at me.

01:04:21.904 --> 01:04:24.364
'The three of them'?

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:29.161
Saori and the rest.

01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:36.502
The night they disappeared,
I was with them.

01:04:39.213 --> 01:04:40.756
Then why didn't...

01:04:40.839 --> 01:04:42.174
I was scared!

01:04:46.178 --> 01:04:48.472
Scared of what?

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:56.605
When we came back
from the school trip...

01:04:58.732 --> 01:05:00.442
...Saori said...

01:05:03.821 --> 01:05:07.366
...there was a haunted house
near here.

01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:09.368
Haunted?

01:05:12.496 --> 01:05:14.790
Where?

01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:17.709
I forget!

01:05:17.793 --> 01:05:19.962
How could you forget?

01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:21.338
I wanted to!

01:05:21.547 --> 01:05:25.342
Lzumi,
will you tell us what's going on?

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:33.642
Even before we went in...

01:05:35.686 --> 01:05:38.981
...I felt something strange.

01:05:42.693 --> 01:05:48.824
Izumi, do you have ESP or something?

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:50.159
I don't.

01:05:50.242 --> 01:05:52.369
It's not that.

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:54.830
You guys keep away.

01:05:59.459 --> 01:06:04.965
Saori and the others treated it as
a joke, but I couldn't stay there.

01:06:06.884 --> 01:06:09.553
I left, by myself.

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:15.934
I was scared. I ran away.

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:20.355
They're coming for me!

01:06:20.439 --> 01:06:24.401
Lzumi, chill out!

01:06:27.529 --> 01:06:29.907
Close the curtains!

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:31.450
Close them!

01:06:32.367 --> 01:06:33.535
Close them!

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:51.595
That's what my husband was like
before he died.

01:06:52.888 --> 01:06:57.351
He had all the windows
closed tight...

01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:03.023
Does Izumi know about that?

01:07:05.651 --> 01:07:10.864
I never told her anything about it.

01:07:28.924 --> 01:07:31.468
The pictures...

01:07:49.027 --> 01:07:51.363
What's that?

01:08:16.095 --> 01:08:17.430
Chiharu!

01:08:56.553 --> 01:08:59.139
Who are you?

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:08.689
Dad?

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:32.714
I saw you at that house, you know.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:18.005
Kayako

01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:26.305
Hello?

01:12:27.139 --> 01:12:30.058
Mariko! It's been ages!

01:12:31.727 --> 01:12:33.729
Yeah. What's up?

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:36.231
Yeah.

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:40.944
Wow, that must have been hard.

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:43.906
Peek-a-boo!

01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:49.661
Peek-a-boo!

01:12:57.085 --> 01:13:00.714
Tomorrow? Yeah, I'm OK.

01:13:01.089 --> 01:13:03.300
Yeah, OK.

01:13:04.218 --> 01:13:06.720
OK, see you.

01:13:11.767 --> 01:13:14.728
I'm coming, Mr Saito.

01:13:17.064 --> 01:13:21.068
I hear you're going to be
a great-grandfather!

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:24.321
Peek-a-boo!

01:13:29.785 --> 01:13:31.119
Mr Saito?

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:41.380
Thank you.

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:30.804
Rika!

01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:33.849
Mariko!

01:14:34.516 --> 01:14:37.311
How have you been?
You've changed your hair.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:38.770
I got it cut.

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:42.274
Are you free Sunday?

01:14:42.566 --> 01:14:44.443
Sunday? Sure.

01:14:44.526 --> 01:14:45.360
Yeah?

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:48.906
He gave me two tickets...

01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:50.908
...and said to take you.

01:14:50.991 --> 01:14:52.242
Really?

01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:56.580
What?

01:14:57.289 --> 01:15:01.710
In third year you liked Toyoshima,
didn't you.

01:15:01.793 --> 01:15:03.003
Huh?

01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:07.216
It was all over your face.

01:15:24.399 --> 01:15:27.194
There's already one problem kid...

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:29.571
in my new class.

01:15:29.863 --> 01:15:32.241
He hasn't come to school once!

01:15:32.866 --> 01:15:33.992
And his parents?

01:15:34.076 --> 01:15:37.329
That's the problem.
I can't contact them.

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:41.250
Well,
there must be some kind of reason...

01:15:41.333 --> 01:15:44.294
At least they could return my calls.

01:15:44.378 --> 01:15:46.547
I want to finish my home visits!

01:15:46.588 --> 01:15:49.591
Oh, yeah... home visits...

01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:53.720
All the other teachers
have finished theirs.

01:15:53.846 --> 01:15:54.555
That's funny.

01:15:54.596 --> 01:15:55.472
What is?

01:15:55.889 --> 01:15:59.518
You're turned into a real teacher.

01:16:00.102 --> 01:16:01.937
What about you?

01:16:03.897 --> 01:16:08.068
I wonder about that.
I don't really understand...

01:16:08.944 --> 01:16:10.404
What?

01:16:11.321 --> 01:16:13.532
I thought I felt...

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:18.370
Rika? Are you OK

01:16:20.122 --> 01:16:22.332
Rika!

01:16:23.458 --> 01:16:26.920
Rika, what's wrong?! Are you OK?

01:16:27.254 --> 01:16:29.047
Uh, yeah...

01:18:43.098 --> 01:18:44.933
Hello, Nishima.

01:18:45.017 --> 01:18:46.477
Rika?

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.564
Mariko? I'm sorry about today.

01:18:51.023 --> 01:18:55.319
You scared me! Are you all right now?

01:18:55.527 --> 01:18:59.114
Yeah. Thanks for asking.

01:18:59.281 --> 01:19:02.743
I'm sorry I ruined your day off.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:05.370
No, I'm OK.

01:19:06.246 --> 01:19:08.081
Where are you now?

01:19:08.123 --> 01:19:11.084
Remember that kid I told you about?

01:19:11.126 --> 01:19:14.129
I'm at his house now.

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:15.631
Yeah...

01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:19.802
There's no one here but the boy.
His parents haven't come home.

01:19:19.927 --> 01:19:22.805
I've been here for an hour.

01:19:29.144 --> 01:19:32.815
Mariko, where exactly are you?

01:19:42.074 --> 01:19:43.200
Hello?

01:19:43.826 --> 01:19:45.285
Hello, Rika?

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:52.125
Hello?

01:19:54.086 --> 01:19:56.171
Hey. Rika!

01:20:05.097 --> 01:20:06.348
Toshio?

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:09.309
Toshio?

01:20:11.145 --> 01:20:12.855
Toshio?

01:20:17.109 --> 01:20:18.777
Toshio?

01:20:24.158 --> 01:20:26.118
Are you up here?

01:20:47.222 --> 01:20:48.765
Mariko!

01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:19.922
