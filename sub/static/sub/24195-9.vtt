10:09.375 --> 10:11.625

10:11.709 --> 10:13.250
You want us to
provide cap intro.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.750
Got it. Absolutely.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.291
What range were
you thinking?

10:16.375 --> 10:16.709
Twenty billion.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.166
And the timing? How soon
do you want the money?

10:21.250 --> 10:23.417
Oh. The year 2112.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.875
We'll do the raise
as a celebration

That's why
we got you in here today.

10:27.917 --> 10:29.709
You mean Moving Pictures
is number one.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.917
But I think it goes Hemispheres
then A Farewell To Kings

10:32.000 --> 10:33.709

10:33.792 --> 10:35.208
Well, you would.

10:35.291 --> 10:38.500
But the point is:
I want the fucking money now.

10:38.583 --> 10:42.041
Look, you want an unprecedented
raise in record time.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.250

to cash in.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.250

Look, you got to give me
a little bit of time.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.709

ideas. I promise.

11:02.792 --> 11:05.375

Generate some money.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.250
Then you can pay

11:09.208 --> 11:11.417

it was a necessity.

Still doing it now,

39:29.583 --> 39:30.750

answered for with blood.

freeman, slave.

for society but shredding it.

40:16.709 --> 40:18.917

you were prosecuting him.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.667

I can tell, the only one

40:20.750 --> 40:22.500
that deserves death
is this whole episode

40:22.583 --> 40:24.417

I don't know how swiftly

40:28.542 --> 40:31.333
but up here
in our jurisdiction,

40:31.417 --> 40:35.000
with regards to the guards
on that transfer van,

40:35.083 --> 40:39.625
you will take your time,
you will investigate thoroughly.

40:39.709 --> 40:41.333
And I am sure
that when you're done,

40:41.417 --> 40:45.291
you're gonna find that those
guards are telling the truth:

40:45.375 --> 40:47.500
That they were attacked
by a resisting felon,

40:47.583 --> 40:49.834
a man you yourself
charged with murder.

40:49.917 --> 40:55.667
And in my book, that is a
clear-cut case of self-defense.

40:55.750 --> 40:56.667
And today,

40:56.750 --> 41:00.875

we have been speaking of,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.709
we don't do diddly

like a dream, honey.

43:23.709 --> 43:26.875
Grand event coming up:
concert at Rose Hall.

43:26.959 --> 43:27.834
That's a big deal!

43:27.917 --> 43:29.417
I try not to think
about like that.

43:29.500 --> 43:30.625
Just me and my piano.

43:30.709 --> 43:33.000
If there was one thing
in life I would do over,

43:33.083 --> 43:35.834
it would be not quitting
piano lessons when I was nine.

43:35.917 --> 43:36.834
He doesn't mean that.

43:36.917 --> 43:38.542
I wish I did.

43:38.625 --> 43:39.959
Well, be glad he doesn't.

43:40.041 --> 43:42.166
Because then you would have to
listen to it all day long.

43:42.250 --> 43:42.709
Hey--

43:42.792 --> 43:44.417
No. It's beautiful.

43:44.500 --> 43:45.792
It's beautiful.

43:45.875 --> 43:47.333
But sometimes you just
want to watch

43:47.417 --> 43:50.208
an old NYPD Blue  episode without
a Tchaikovsky soundtrack.

43:51.417 --> 43:52.542
Are you
holding up okay, Chuck?

43:52.625 --> 43:54.959
That story in the news is awful.
That boy dying in custody.

43:58.041 --> 43:59.250
A tragedy.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.041
We're investigating thoroughly.

44:01.125 --> 44:02.959
The guards' statements
were very strong.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.750
But it's too early
to say anything.

44:04.834 --> 44:06.542
Really, we're still
gathering physical evidence.

44:06.625 --> 44:10.250
But in the end,
justice will be done.

44:12.542 --> 44:14.291
Something in
your throat, old pal?

44:15.792 --> 44:17.333
Don't make me say it.

44:17.417 --> 44:19.875
I don't
want to say it.

44:19.959 --> 44:22.750
Well, it's jumped from
your throat to your eyes.

44:22.834 --> 44:25.458
Fine, since it's bypassed
your guts, I'll say it for you.

44:25.542 --> 44:27.083
You think that I let
the attorney general

44:27.166 --> 44:29.458
stick his hand up my ass
and run me like a sock puppet.

44:30.542 --> 44:31.542
I'm just glad
I got out of there

44:31.625 --> 44:33.000
before I had to get
caught up in any of that.

44:33.959 --> 44:36.417
You know, let's--let's
just leave it there.

44:36.500 --> 44:39.542
Not a fucking chance.

44:39.625 --> 44:41.333
Oh, it's amazing
how fast it happens

44:41.417 --> 44:43.125
when you go from being
a starting player

44:43.208 --> 44:43.750
to the sidelines.

44:43.834 --> 44:46.000
I'll tell you something.

44:46.083 --> 44:48.041
If I were still on
the same damn team,

44:48.125 --> 44:49.750
those guards would
be in custody today.

44:49.834 --> 44:51.709
Sure. And you imagine,
what, that I don't care?

44:51.792 --> 44:55.834
Or that I'm not
strong enough?

44:55.917 --> 44:56.792
Or that I'm bought
and paid for?

44:56.875 --> 45:00.458
I imagine you've made
some calculations

45:00.542 --> 45:01.792
that allow you
to live with it.

45:01.875 --> 45:03.750
No matter who's left
swinging in the wind--

45:03.834 --> 45:05.917
This does not have
to become any--

45:06.000 --> 45:07.417
No, no, it does.

45:07.500 --> 45:12.125
Self righteousness is
an indulgence I cannot afford.

45:12.208 --> 45:15.333
Calculation is not something
to be scoffed at.

45:15.417 --> 45:18.291
It's a tool.
A tactic.

45:18.375 --> 45:20.291
And I use it
proudly and often.

45:20.375 --> 45:22.083
But here. Today.

45:22.166 --> 45:25.125
About this.
There was none.

45:25.208 --> 45:28.125
No. There was only a dead man
who should've been left alive.

45:29.166 --> 45:30.458
And I'll tell you
something, Lonnie,

45:30.542 --> 45:31.750
if you were still
in the office,

45:31.834 --> 45:33.166
nothing would've
been different.

45:33.250 --> 45:36.417
Not one thing.

45:37.458 --> 45:38.750
Oh, I'm really glad
to see you here tonight,

45:42.041 --> 45:44.333

successful at everything

45:44.417 --> 45:45.625

45:45.709 --> 45:47.792
No. You are, no doubt,
exactly where

45:47.875 --> 45:50.375
you are supposed
to be now.

you can't lose my money.

48:35.834 --> 48:37.792
No. Of course not.

to make and not lose money--

Happy occasion like this

49:02.750 --> 49:07.208
reminds me
of funny story.

49:10.166 --> 49:11.375
Many years ago,

49:11.458 --> 49:14.208
I was walking along
the Moskva Christmas market.

49:14.291 --> 49:16.875
You ever seen
Moskva Christmas market?

49:16.959 --> 49:19.750

of good cheer,

49:19.834 --> 49:21.709
even during
the lean years.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.166
I think
it was the wine.

49:23.250 --> 49:26.375
They serve warm wine
with the spices in it.

49:26.458 --> 49:28.417
Cinnamon and...

49:28.500 --> 49:29.375
I was waiting
on the line--

49:29.458 --> 49:32.625
everyone was always
waiting on the line.

49:32.709 --> 49:34.333
And finally I got my cup,

49:34.417 --> 49:37.000
I turn, and there was
this little boy.

49:37.083 --> 49:38.959
Runny nose.

49:39.041 --> 49:42.709
He--he's looking at me
so desirous of my cup

49:42.792 --> 49:46.834
of this warm, warm wine

49:46.917 --> 49:50.208
that I give him a sip.

49:50.291 --> 49:53.208
He stares at me
with such a gratitude.

49:56.792 --> 50:01.542
And then
I notice his mother.

50:01.625 --> 50:02.917
Plump breasts--

50:03.000 --> 50:06.834
she must have
known someone.

50:06.917 --> 50:10.250
So I give him
my cup of wine.

50:10.333 --> 50:13.709
And I take his mother
away from the square.

50:13.792 --> 50:16.208
Behind the soldiers.

50:18.250 --> 50:23.250
And after, I leave her
for  the soldiers.

50:29.291 --> 50:32.083
And I walked back,

50:32.166 --> 50:36.750
and this little boy
is staring at me

50:36.834 --> 50:41.041
with his greedy
drunken eyes.
