00:01.001 --> 00:03.461
-Say Freaky.
-[all] Freaky!

00:04.796 --> 00:08.466
After tonight,
your life is going to change forever.

00:08.550 --> 00:09.551
PREVIOUSLY

00:09.634 --> 00:10.969
[applause]

00:11.553 --> 00:13.138
Mom said she lost everything that night.

00:13.221 --> 00:14.556
She lost you.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.725
[Cocó] <i>Caterina was never able</i>
<i>to understand me.</i>

00:16.808 --> 00:18.184
Maybe you could start here.

00:18.268 --> 00:19.853
"Light Years"
A Novel by Caterina Sharp

00:21.730 --> 00:23.023
[Marco] <i>I'm writing a new song,</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:25.191
<i>and I thought that maybe</i>
<i>you might want to listen to it.</i>

00:25.275 --> 00:27.610
You know that I don't really like
for you to do those things.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.655
Your dad has to understand you.
Why don't you tell him the truth?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.115
I've never gotten up the courage
to face him.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.910
I invested a fortune in this show.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.204
People want to see
the two Sharp women together onstage.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.623
-[gasps]
-I don't feel right betraying Tomás.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.960
This is show business.
Tomás will understand perfectly.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.171
You destroyed our relationship,
and you destroyed my career.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.464
And I swear you will regret it.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.548
And you too.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.175
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

00:50.258 --> 00:52.427
[Allegra] <i>I think what happened</i>
<i>on opening day was no accident.</i>

00:52.510 --> 00:55.305
It terrifies me to think that you could
travel to the past and not come back.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.306
I love you.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.517
[Allegra] <i>That night destroyed</i>
<i>the theater and my family.</i>

00:59.601 --> 01:01.436
There's still time
to change what happened.

01:14.324 --> 01:16.785
INTERTWINED

01:17.369 --> 01:18.703
[coughing]

01:20.622 --> 01:22.624
[panting]

01:28.505 --> 01:30.340
[Allegra] No, no, no.
This can't be happening.

01:36.554 --> 01:41.184
THREE HOURS EARLIER

01:41.267 --> 01:44.479
[applause]

01:44.562 --> 01:46.064
[man] Bravo!

01:52.862 --> 01:54.864
-[cheering]
-[man 2] Bravo!

02:17.637 --> 02:18.930
[man 2] Bravo!

02:22.517 --> 02:24.811
[chatter]

02:24.894 --> 02:26.312
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

02:28.606 --> 02:29.607
Congratulations.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.570
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.285
Where is my favorite actress?
I want to give her a hug.

02:40.368 --> 02:45.123
Marvelous. Absolutely marvelous.
Absolutely. No, no, the emotion…

02:45.623 --> 02:48.877
I can't believe you're back.
You were incredible. Congratulations.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.004
I think you owe someone an apology.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.299
You're right.
I know it was wrong, and I'm sorry.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.633
I'm not talking about me.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.097
And you? Where did you run off to?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.350
I was in the audience. Congratulations.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.143
Why did you give your part to Caterina?

03:05.810 --> 03:08.480
There are more important things
than the lead in a play.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.149
You never stop surprising me.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.652
All right. You can go home now.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.529
Why the rush
when opening night was such a success?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.073
Tomás told me
there was going to be a party.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.157
-Obviously.
-Marco.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.451
You promised me that as soon
as the play was over, you would go.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.286
Yes, but in a bit.
Now, we're going to party.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.288
I need you to trust me and leave now.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.290
But are you going to at least explain why?

03:29.292 --> 03:32.462
Wait for me at home. If I don't make it
for some reason, find Lucía.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.547
She's Caterina's grandmother.
She'll explain it to you.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.175
Okay, okay. I'm going to change and go.

03:37.258 --> 03:39.969
But I'll wait for you at home
so I can show you my new song.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.807
See you later. [blows kiss]

03:45.308 --> 03:48.061
Why did you steal the part of Ellie
from me if you didn't even want it?

03:48.144 --> 03:49.729
[scoffs] You wouldn't understand.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.648
Leave her alone, sweetie. She's fickle.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.319
-Have you seen Caterina?
-She went into Cocó's dressing room.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.363
[sighs] I thought it was impossible

03:58.446 --> 04:01.449
and that it was all
going to turn out wrong, but I did it.

04:01.533 --> 04:02.992
I managed to change the past.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.786
I managed to get Marco out of the theater

04:04.869 --> 04:07.080
and stop the falling out
between Caterina and Cocó.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.584
Why are you looking at me like that?
It worked.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.421
Time can be deceptive.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.549
I just know that this is why
the bracelet brought me to this time.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.052
I don't want you to get your hopes up.

04:21.136 --> 04:25.056
Laura, can you explain to me why
you disappeared like that? What happened?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.767
-Come with me.
-Coming. I'll see you later.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.729
<i>In Search of Lost Time</i>.
If you want to know more, look there.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.191
STAGE
DRESSING ROOMS

04:35.275 --> 04:37.318
-[female student] Thank you. See you.
-[Marco] You're welcome.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.279
-[female student 2] Bye.
-[Marco] See you.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.629
[Franco] So you were studying
with your classmates, huh?

05:03.053 --> 05:07.432
I thought it was just
a rebellious teenage phase, nothing more.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.602
That he needed a little more discipline.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.564
If I had talked to him, instead of…

05:14.647 --> 05:16.358
I know it's hard,

05:16.441 --> 05:21.654
but if you could tell me
what you remember about opening night.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.906
Anything at all.

05:23.948 --> 05:26.618
Not a day goes by
that I don't think of that night.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.457
Weren't you going to study
with your classmates?

05:32.540 --> 05:35.168
Wasn't that it? I went to the university
to look for you. You weren't there.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.420
When I get there, I find out you were
suspended due to absences.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.630
You failed the admission course.

05:38.713 --> 05:39.964
Dad, I can explain what happened.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.258
What are you going to explain? Huh?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.636
You told me you were going.
It was a lie. Are you going to lie again?

05:44.719 --> 05:47.222
But I tried to tell you the truth,
but you wouldn't listen.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.348
You never listen to me.

05:48.431 --> 05:52.936
Ah. So it's my fault. And what's this?

05:53.019 --> 05:56.856
Tell me what this is.
What is this? What is this?

05:56.940 --> 05:58.400
You went through my things?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.026
You left me no choice, Marco!

06:02.862 --> 06:05.657
I don't even recognize you.
Look at you. I don't know who you are.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.162
I do know who I am.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.791
And I'm tired of hiding.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.920
And I had big plans for you.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.007
A university degree,
a sure future at the finance agency.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.675
-All handed to you--
-But I don't want that!

06:23.758 --> 06:25.719
Don't you understand
that I never wanted that?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.388
Can you understand that this is my life?
Please. I'm asking you.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.598
I'm going to decide
what I want to do with my future!

06:30.682 --> 06:32.475
Can you listen to the music that I make?
Please.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.437
-It's the only way you can understand me.
-You will stop that!

06:39.190 --> 06:42.360
And go change. All right?
Take that garbage off your face.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.862
You look ridiculous.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.656
And starting tomorrow, full time
at the finance agency. Is that clear?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.076
No.

06:51.953 --> 06:52.954
No, what?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.623
Don't defy me, Marco. All right?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.878
If you want to continue living at home,
you have to follow my rules.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.761
Very well.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.306
Then I don't want to see you again.

07:13.641 --> 07:18.146
You've let me down, Marco, you know that?
You're not the son I hoped for.

07:20.899 --> 07:21.900
You're not.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.782
I will never forgive myself.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.534
Ever.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.333
After that, he got his things
and came here, to the theater.

07:40.794 --> 07:45.465
So, that night Marco… died?

07:48.426 --> 07:51.054
All the investigators found
was the pick with his initials.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.765
I'm sorry to insist.

07:53.848 --> 07:59.771
But some of his friends thought
he had run off with a girl. Laura.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.650
No, no, no, no. He-- He wouldn't do that.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.738
We had our differences,
but… he was a good person.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.830
That's why I had a headstone
with his name placed in the cemetery.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.917
I needed a place
where I could go to visit him.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.713
Yes. Thank you for telling me this.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.464
I-I know it's not easy. No.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.591
It's good for me to remember my son,
you know?

08:31.469 --> 08:33.763
And well,
that girl was very important to him.

08:34.305 --> 08:38.059
And it's the least I can do for you--
To help you with the documentary.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.647
Wait. Wait, because there's…

08:43.690 --> 08:44.858
there's something else.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.822
[knocking, door opens]

08:56.036 --> 08:57.620
I am so proud of you.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.330
Mom.

08:59.414 --> 09:04.836
I was right. You just had to be confident
and face your fears.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.592
You don't understand at all.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.804
I don't want to be
a musical theater actress.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.474
I won't be getting back on stage again.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.684
If you give up your career
in musical theater,

09:19.768 --> 09:21.311
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.520
You're wrong.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.857
Do you know how much others would give
to have the opportunity you have?

09:25.940 --> 09:30.445
And you're going to give it up to write…
nonsense in a notebook?

09:30.528 --> 09:32.197
It's my decision.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.204
No, it's not.

09:39.996 --> 09:42.540
You're a minor.
So you're coming with me on tour.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.835
-You can't do this to me.
-The decision is made.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.545
It's for your own good.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.339
One day you'll thank me.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.721
Why should I thank you?

09:58.223 --> 10:01.810
Because you tried to buy off Oliverio so
that he wouldn't let me join his workshop?

10:02.811 --> 10:05.313
Because you manipulated my boyfriend
to get me to come back to the play?

10:05.397 --> 10:07.148
-No, Caterina. I didn't--
-And now,

10:07.232 --> 10:10.568
you want to force me to go on tour
for who knows how long,

10:10.652 --> 10:13.613
knowing that this means giving up
the best thing that's ever happened to me?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.827
You're not my mom. You're a curse.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.917
-Caterina.
-I don't want to talk right now.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.589
[knocking, door opens]

10:31.673 --> 10:32.966
I need to be alone.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.095
-I have to talk to you.
-It's not a good time.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.430
[sighs]

10:44.352 --> 10:47.397
I've imagined this moment
since Caterina was born.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.649
The two of us together, on stage.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.154
Do you know what it cost me
to get where I am?

10:54.863 --> 10:56.823
I didn't have a mom
that paved the way for me.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.451
You had a mom
that respected your decision.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.039
Caterina was brave enough
to risk everything for her dream.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.374
That's what makes a true Sharp.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.835
That's what you did.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.256
There's still time
to save your relationship with her.

11:18.678 --> 11:23.141
I've never seen Marco like this.
He was fighting with his dad.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.310
You could see he arrived
just before the ending,

11:25.393 --> 11:27.729
and the ending wasn't the least bit happy.

11:28.271 --> 11:32.525
-Sparks flew. It was terrible--
-Where did Marco go?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.496
She never supported me. Ever.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.750
She's always been so selfish.
She only worries about herself.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.670
Stop.
I think you're being a little unfair.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.215
Cocó saved Eleven O'Clock.
She got Mike to produce the tour.

11:55.298 --> 11:59.844
Exactly. She saved her company.
She had it all planned.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.972
She was negotiating with Mike
long before the fire at the theater.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.476
She wanted to ruin my life.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.354
She has no morals.

12:09.437 --> 12:12.565
And she showed it again
when she betrayed Tomás.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.152
Did you ever want to talk to her,
get closer? I don't know, maybe--

12:16.236 --> 12:19.197
For what? Cocó put her career
and her interests before everything.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.199
Always. Even her family.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.660
We all have to take responsibility
for our own decisions.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.123
Cocó! [chuckles]

12:28.206 --> 12:33.086
You were right, huh?
Opening night was a tremendous success.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.296
And Caterina came back to the company.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.215
Frankly,
I don't know how you convinced her.

12:37.298 --> 12:41.136
I already thanked Laura
for giving up her spot.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.306
Caterina isn't going to stay
with the company.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.142
What?

12:49.477 --> 12:53.732
I can't force my daughter
to live a life she doesn't want.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.029
What great timing, no?

13:00.488 --> 13:04.409
To-- To choose to have an epiphany
about how to be a model mother.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.330
With Caterina onstage…

13:10.582 --> 13:12.417
success is guaranteed.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.796
The decision is made.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.260
Cocó… please.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.388
I'm begging you.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.184
I can't. I'm so sorry, Tomás.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.397
You're going to regret it
much more when I call my lawyer.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.649
-What?
-You forgetting we have a signed contract?

13:36.733 --> 13:38.735
-Did you forget that?
-I can't believe it.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.655
And the contract very clearly says
that Caterina has to be in the play.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.993
And that she also has to be on tour. Huh?

13:47.077 --> 13:48.787
Tomás,
we've known each other our whole lives.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.580
-Please. What are you saying?
-It's nothing personal.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.207
It's business. That's all.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.378
She's my daughter,

13:57.337 --> 13:59.881
and I am going to respect her decision.
Whatever the cost.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.260
-Excuse me. What are you doing? Get--
-Please, Tomás!

14:04.344 --> 14:05.595
I have to say something very import--

14:06.554 --> 14:07.555
[sighs]

14:07.639 --> 14:10.225
Come on. Come with us.
Everyone is going to the Galleria.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.269
-We're going to party there.
-All right, all right. Let's go.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.857
I never understood why you allied yourself
with my mom to get the role of Adam.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.527
For us.
I didn't want to be separated from you.

14:20.610 --> 14:25.323
I dreamed of traveling the world together,
going on tour. I didn't want to lose you.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.160
You never told me that.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.454
[Bárbara] <i>Silence!</i>

14:31.538 --> 14:34.749
Cheers to Eleven O'Clock.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.251
-Whoo!
-[cheering]

14:36.334 --> 14:38.670
Relax, sweetie.
Orange juice. I've learned.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.258
Hey.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.469
[Bárbara] Did you see
how many people were there?

14:47.095 --> 14:48.638
Are you ever going to forgive me?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.351
-Definitely not tonight.
-[Bárbara] Incredible. I can't believe it.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.982
I decided to accept your proposal.

14:59.941 --> 15:03.695
Ah, good. I thought
you would never betray your friend.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.280
There was a change of plans.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.490
And right on opening day.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.411
I love unexpected twists.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.707
I still have the rights to the play.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.709
But there's one problem.

15:17.792 --> 15:21.796
I already signed the contract with Tomás
for the tour in Caterina's name.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.757
That doesn't have to be an issue.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.217
All we need…

15:31.222 --> 15:32.432
is a stroke of luck.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.352
[Cocó] <i>She's my daughter,</i>

15:36.019 --> 15:39.105

<i>Whatever the cost.</i>

15:51.576 --> 15:54.287
[Diego] <i>I tried to tell you,</i>
<i>but you didn't want to listen to me.</i>

15:54.371 --> 15:56.414
That doesn't justify
what you did to Marco.

15:56.498 --> 15:57.999
You stole the role of Adam from him.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.711
-That was your mom.
-Yes, I know. And you agreed.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.214
Yes, I know.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.758
Justification is always easier
than confrontation.

16:06.841 --> 16:10.845
If I had done things differently,
he would be here with us today.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.308
I made a series of bad decisions.
One after the other.

16:16.518 --> 16:18.520
[chatter]

16:19.062 --> 16:20.188
Have you seen Marco?

16:21.314 --> 16:24.109
-Don't even say his name. He's the worst.
-Have you seen him or not?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.778
What do I know? I don't know.
He came by a bit ago, on foot.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.113
He wanted to sleep at the record store,

16:28.196 --> 16:29.572
-but I told him no.
-Why?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.199
Because I'm sick of his attitude.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.702
I always have to be covering for him.
I don't feel like it.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.787
[panting]

16:52.137 --> 16:54.139
[crackles]

17:01.479 --> 17:03.064
Is Allegra here?

17:03.148 --> 17:04.733
No, sweetie. It's just Dad and me.

17:05.775 --> 17:09.821
Are you sure? You didn't hear a noise
or see a flash of light or anything?

17:09.904 --> 17:10.905
Huh?

17:25.754 --> 17:27.255

-Hey, where are you going?
-Let me through! I have to go in there!

17:38.683 --> 17:40.435
No. It's too dangerous.
I just called the fire department.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.895
My friend is inside!

17:41.978 --> 17:45.732
Don't worry. There's no one left inside.
Let's go. Please. Please!

Marco, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
I messed everything up.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.043
Here.

19:28.668 --> 19:29.878
I love you, Laura.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.059
But-- Wait.

22:31.142 --> 22:36.856
So, there was never a version
of '94 without you?

22:39.234 --> 22:40.235
I guess not.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.488
It sounds weird,

22:44.364 --> 22:49.244
but it seems like I was always there,
traveling from 2021.

22:49.786 --> 22:54.290
That's why Greta remembered you. Hmm?
And you appeared on the VHS tapes.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.084
I wasn't changing the past.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.754
That was always the past.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.006
Of course.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.969
But if I never had even
the slightest chance of changing anything,

23:06.052 --> 23:08.138
why did the bracelet take me there?

23:10.557 --> 23:15.895
And-- Trying to understand
the Sharp women is impossible. Hmm?

23:16.479 --> 23:18.231
A waste of time, I would say.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.571
Yes. That's it.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.990
-What?
-Félix, you're a genius.

23:27.574 --> 23:28.575

"Dear Allegra.

33:27.882 --> 33:28.883
Sofía.

33:32.971 --> 33:33.972
I'm sorry.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.309
Forgive me. I never wanted to hurt you.

33:39.686 --> 33:41.604
I always thought I was helping you and…

33:46.276 --> 33:51.740
You are brilliant at everything you do…

33:52.741 --> 33:54.826
and I'm very proud of you.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.335
[sniffs]

34:13.595 --> 34:16.264
I was looking for you. You were great.

34:16.348 --> 34:18.808
Thank you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.437
Um, what happened?

34:23.313 --> 34:24.481
I'll explain later.

34:24.564 --> 34:27.442
I need to ask you a favor.
I promise it's the very last one.

34:27.525 --> 34:28.526
[sighs]

34:29.069 --> 34:30.487
Okay. [chuckles]

34:31.654 --> 34:34.491
[tape rewinding]

34:36.326 --> 34:38.536
[Alan] What's up, brother?
What are you doing?

34:38.620 --> 34:41.081
Nothing. Personal stuff. Nothing.

34:41.164 --> 34:42.749
And those prehistoric tapes?

34:43.583 --> 34:49.339
These-- The-- References for a short
I'm making. Nothing. Just personal stuff.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.299
Okay, good. Is there a new story coming?

34:51.383 --> 34:53.134
I'm not the only one. You too--

34:53.218 --> 34:55.887
Congratulations
for getting into Eleven O'Clock. Good job.

34:55.970 --> 34:58.056
I'm going to miss you when I go on tour.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.892
-Me too. Don't get any ideas. I'm crying.
-Crying?

35:00.975 --> 35:02.310
Yes, I feel terrible. I feel--

35:02.394 --> 35:03.770
-My little brother.
-No, no, no.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.855
-What's wrong with you?
-Enough, enough.

35:05.939 --> 35:07.691
Sorry. Wanna get something to eat?

35:07.774 --> 35:09.109
-[Félix] Let's do it.
-[Alan] Did you eat yet?

35:09.192 --> 35:11.653
[Félix] No, but I'm dying
of hunger anyway and…

35:33.216 --> 35:35.343
It gives me chills to be here.

35:36.428 --> 35:38.221
After everything that happened.

35:39.097 --> 35:41.683
A little karma wouldn't hurt you.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.935
Where do you get all this sarcasm?

35:44.019 --> 35:46.604
A legacy from my Sharp upbringing.

35:46.688 --> 35:47.939
Silence.

35:49.733 --> 35:52.527
What more do you two need
to understand each other?

35:52.610 --> 35:54.446
Do you need to switch bodies
like in <i>Freaky Friday</i>?

36:01.786 --> 36:04.080
There's something important
I have to show you.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.082
That's why I asked you to come.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.335
You two have been distant for a long time.

36:10.003 --> 36:10.920
Since that night--

36:11.004 --> 36:12.756
Allegra,
I don't know what lies Cocó has told you--

36:12.839 --> 36:14.341
Enough! I didn't tell her anything!

36:14.424 --> 36:15.633
Can I speak, please?

36:18.219 --> 36:20.347
I have recordings
from the security cameras.

36:21.181 --> 36:24.684
They were here,
with all the things that Bárbara saved.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.145
It's all on tape.

36:28.688 --> 36:31.858
Up to the time the cameras
were disconnected before the fire.

36:34.652 --> 36:35.653
Félix?

36:37.405 --> 36:38.406
[cell phone beeps]

36:39.366 --> 36:40.367
[beeps]

36:40.450 --> 36:42.452
[Cocó] <i>We've known each other</i>
<i>our whole lives. Please.</i>

36:42.535 --> 36:45.872
[Tomás] <i>It's nothing personal.</i>
<i>It's business. That's all.</i>

36:45.955 --> 36:48.291
[Cocó] <i>She's my daughter.</i>
<i>And I am going to respect her decision,</i>

36:48.375 --> 36:49.834
<i>whatever the cost.</i>

36:49.918 --> 36:51.961
<i>You're not going to ruin me.</i>

36:52.045 --> 36:53.755
[Tomás] <i>Either Caterina stays in the play</i>

36:53.838 --> 36:56.341
<i>or you're going to need</i>
<i>to hire a good lawyer.</i>

36:56.424 --> 37:00.053
<i>Do what you have to do, Tomás.</i>
<i>I'm going to support my daughter.</i>

37:04.349 --> 37:06.768
The truth is that Cocó
didn't act out of selfishness.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.188
She tried to protect you from Tomás.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.066
He wanted you to continue in the company.

37:15.193 --> 37:18.738
Tomás was desperate.

37:19.781 --> 37:23.952
He had invested a lot more than he had
and his creditors were pressuring him.

37:25.704 --> 37:29.457
He was counting
on having Cocó Sharp's heir on stage,

37:29.541 --> 37:33.211
but when I assured him that wasn't going
to happen…

37:34.629 --> 37:36.131
he lost his mind.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.551
He destroyed the theater.

37:41.428 --> 37:43.096
I guess to collect the insurance.

37:44.139 --> 37:45.432
I can't believe it.

37:47.767 --> 37:51.771
I spent years convinced
that the reality was otherwise.

37:53.023 --> 37:54.107
Blaming you.

37:56.067 --> 37:58.570
I don't know-- I don't know what to say.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.699
[Allegra] You could start by apologizing.

38:03.450 --> 38:05.785
You, too, Cocó. You owe my mom an apology.

38:06.619 --> 38:08.329
You were never able to understand her.

38:09.706 --> 38:12.083
And you weren't there for her
when she needed you most.

38:16.546 --> 38:17.881
Forgive me, Caterina.

38:19.841 --> 38:21.343
I put too much pressure on you.

38:23.094 --> 38:25.347
Thank you for having the courage

38:26.264 --> 38:30.352
to defend your dreams
and not give in to mine.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.606
I never told you…

38:37.484 --> 38:39.319
but I'm so proud of you.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.240
Thank you.

38:50.455 --> 38:53.917
I am so proud of you, daughter.

38:55.710 --> 38:58.296
And that you auditioned
for Eleven O'Clock.

39:03.968 --> 39:05.720
I don't want to join Eleven O'Clock.

39:05.804 --> 39:07.305
-What?
-What do you mean?

39:07.389 --> 39:08.973
After everything you fought for?

39:10.517 --> 39:12.977
Cocó put her work above her family.

39:14.396 --> 39:18.400
And you, Mom, did the opposite.
I was always your priority.

39:19.567 --> 39:21.069
I want to continue in theater.

39:22.612 --> 39:24.656
But I don't want to be separated
from you two.

39:27.242 --> 39:31.579
That's why I asked you to come here.
I have a proposal.

39:38.920 --> 39:39.921

40:14.581 --> 40:16.583
Félix. [chuckles] Hi.

40:16.666 --> 40:18.168
I came to wish you luck.

40:18.251 --> 40:21.296
Or is it bad luck
to wish someone good luck in the theater?

40:21.379 --> 40:22.922
I never got that. So no--

40:23.006 --> 40:26.676
For me, it's good luck for you
to come see me before I go onstage. So…

40:26.760 --> 40:29.679
I haven't told you the best thing yet.
Something really weird happened.

40:29.763 --> 40:31.264
I got a letter from the university

40:31.348 --> 40:34.351
with a date for an interview
for the scholarship.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.353
And what's weird about that?

40:36.436 --> 40:38.730
I never made the short.
I never sent in anything.

40:40.106 --> 40:42.776
Um, I forgot to tell you.

40:42.859 --> 40:47.197
I sent your mockumentary
about the actress that fails her director.

40:48.156 --> 40:50.033
You can't be mad
because it all worked out.

40:50.116 --> 40:55.038
Now I understand why the jury
congratulated me on the special effects.

40:55.121 --> 40:56.373
[Allegra chuckles]

40:57.916 --> 40:58.958
Thank you.

40:59.042 --> 41:01.127
No. You have nothing to thank me for.

41:01.211 --> 41:05.882
What's more, I still owe you.
You never abandoned me this whole time.

41:06.716 --> 41:10.804
I couldn't have, even if I wanted to.
[chuckles]

41:27.779 --> 41:30.156
All right, all right, all right,
all right.

41:30.240 --> 41:31.366
Did I miss an episode?

41:31.449 --> 41:35.203
Félix, what are you doing here?
And in yellow, no less?

41:35.286 --> 41:38.164
Don't you know that yellow is bad luck
in the theater?

41:38.248 --> 41:41.793
It's mustard. And I'm pretty sure
that's only for the actors.

41:41.876 --> 41:44.254
You can wait for her in the audience.
We're on in five.

41:44.337 --> 41:47.173
-And change your clothes, sweetie.

Thank you for joining this madhouse.

I'm happy to be a part of this madhouse
that is just getting started.

42:19.748 --> 42:22.125
So I'll leave you all to get ready. Okay?

42:22.208 --> 42:23.460
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.213
I can't believe it. I've never performed
for such a large audience.

42:29.174 --> 42:30.925
-I've never performed for an audience!
-[chuckles]

42:31.009 --> 42:32.886
I don't know what I was thinking
when I agreed

42:32.969 --> 42:35.513
to adapt the nonsense I wrote
in my notebook into a musical.

42:35.597 --> 42:38.350
I don't know what I was thinking
when I said all those terrible things.

42:38.933 --> 42:41.144
Well, fortunately,
we were able to rewrite history.

42:41.227 --> 42:42.395
That's right.

42:43.271 --> 42:45.148
-Well, can I call you Grandma now?
-Never.

42:47.025 --> 42:49.861

Nothing compares to the feeling
of being about to go onstage.

42:53.114 --> 42:56.034
-For you, because you're used to it!
-No, I'm nervous too.

42:56.618 --> 42:59.954
It's the first time I've directed
and acted in my own theater.

She only remembered him.

and transformed into the love she felt

for her daughter.

43:35.532 --> 43:41.329
She liked to think that that same love
would continue traveling through time.

When she looked at her daughter
for the first time,

she felt that she was entering an area
that was unknown and unsettling,
