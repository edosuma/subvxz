00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.510 --> 00:12.644
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.646 --> 00:14.880
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.882 --> 00:17.649
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.651 --> 00:19.985
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.987 --> 00:22.621
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.623 --> 00:25.491
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.493 --> 00:29.461
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.463 --> 00:33.499
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.501 --> 00:36.502
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.504 --> 00:38.170
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.172 --> 00:40.572
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.574 --> 00:43.008
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.010 --> 00:45.511
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.513 --> 00:51.650
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:03.264 --> 01:06.732
Oh, this is the one.
Stop here, please.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.601
But, Princess, who would
hold a party here?

01:09.603 --> 01:12.538
- Witches.
- Sofia!

01:12.540 --> 01:13.839
Hi, Lucinda.

01:13.841 --> 01:14.907
I'm ready for
your cauldronation.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.676
Hmm. Not yet.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.445
Witch-a-doodle-do.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.917
Okay, now you're ready.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.352
( giggles )
Oh, look at this outfit.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.354
So witchy.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.523
There's still tons
to set up. Come on.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.327
Whoa!

01:45.639 --> 01:47.473
SOFIA: This looks amazing.

01:47.475 --> 01:50.476
Thanks, but I think we need
to put out more newts.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.277
Lots more newts.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.581
Oh, they're so... festive.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.915
I think so, too.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.917
So, I've never been to
a cauldronation.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.652
What is it exactly?

02:00.654 --> 02:02.921
It's a really special ceremony

02:02.923 --> 02:05.624
where I have to prove that
I'm ready to be a witch.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.392
How do you do that?

02:07.394 --> 02:09.628
By making a powerful broom
called the raven catcher.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.963
Your newt's running away.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.899
Oh... ahhh! Thanks.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.568
It's taken me a long time
to learn the spells and potion

02:16.570 --> 02:19.138
that give the raven catcher
its magic.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.906
Sounds like
a lot of work.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.408
It is, but it's worth it.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.910
If everything goes well,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.979
when I take off
on my raven catcher broom

02:26.981 --> 02:29.314
just as the moon
rises tonight,

02:29.316 --> 02:31.583
everyone will see
I'm not Lucinda
the little witch anymore.

02:31.585 --> 02:35.587
They will see that I'm
Lucinda the midnight witch!

02:35.589 --> 02:36.822
That's what big witches
are called.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.323
You must be nervous.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.760
I am, and not just because
I have to make a powerful broom.

02:41.762 --> 02:44.596
Here. Help me hang
these cobwebs?

02:44.598 --> 02:48.200
What I'm most nervous about
is picking a witch of honor.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.935
What's a witch of honor?

02:49.937 --> 02:52.371
It's a special witch friend
I have to choose

02:52.373 --> 02:54.640
to help me make a potion
at the end of the ceremony.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.176
I'm trying to decide
between Indigo,

02:57.178 --> 02:58.777
my best bad witch friend,

02:58.779 --> 03:01.313
or Lily, my best
good witch friend.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.182
Oh. Tough choice.

03:03.184 --> 03:07.653
Especially since Indigo
and Lily are complete opposites.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.288
I'm afraid they're not gonna
get along at the party.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.124
And whoever I don't
choose to be my witch of honor,

03:12.126 --> 03:13.992
is probably gonna
get really upset.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.395
Like, witch upset.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.797
And ruin your special day?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.232
( sighs heavily )
Right.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.001
Well, what if I keep
an eye on Lily and Indigo,

03:23.003 --> 03:25.837
and make sure that
they get along today,
no matter what?

03:25.839 --> 03:26.805
You'd do that?

03:26.807 --> 03:29.007
I'd be happy to.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.876
I just want your cauldronation
to go well, Lucinda.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.711
Thanks, Sofia.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.179
I'm really glad
you're here.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.647
Me, too.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.816
( laughter )

03:37.818 --> 03:39.718
- What was that?
- More guests.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.322
Lucinda! Hi, Lucy-woosey!

03:43.324 --> 03:46.458
That's Lily, my good witch
friend I was telling you about.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.661
Think fast.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.163
( laughter )

03:51.165 --> 03:53.765
And I'm guessing that's
your bad witch friend Indigo.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.267
Yep.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.738
Lucinda!
I'm so excited

03:59.740 --> 04:01.740
for your big day.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.243
Wanna see the cauldronation
present I got you?

04:04.245 --> 04:06.111
Kitty-ocity!

04:06.113 --> 04:08.347
Aw, I love it!
Thanks, Lily.

04:08.349 --> 04:11.283
Do I know
my best friend or what?

04:11.285 --> 04:14.886
So have you picked
your witch of honor yet?

04:14.888 --> 04:17.055
Uh, not yet.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.790
Then I will make it
easy for you.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.792
Pick me, your oldest,
bestest,

04:20.794 --> 04:22.561
and way baddest
friend.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.730
The one who knows what type
of cat you really like.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.098
Bad-cat-eous.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.233
- You're welcome.
- Silly Indigo.

04:28.235 --> 04:30.736
Lucinda's a good witch now.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.872
She prefers cute,
fluffy cat.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.707
Is that so?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.242
I think both cats
are great,

04:37.244 --> 04:38.910
so no need to argue, okay?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.312
Who are you?

04:40.314 --> 04:41.913
You don't act like
a bad witch.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.949
And you don't look like
a good witch.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.450
This is my friend Sofia.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.152
I'm just a princess...

04:47.154 --> 04:49.121
in witches' clothing.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.390
Oh, that's cute.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.259
I think the ceremony's starting
soon, isn't it, Lucinda?

04:54.261 --> 04:56.061
Uh, yes, it is.

04:56.063 --> 04:59.064
You two should go find
a good spot by the candles.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.932
Good luck, Lucinda.

05:00.934 --> 05:04.636
I know you'll make
the best raven catcher
broom ever,

05:04.638 --> 05:08.507
and I say that as your
super duper best friend

05:08.509 --> 05:10.776
who'd love to be
your witch of honor.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.577
So pick me.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.513
Unless you want a really
wicked witch of honor.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.814
Then pick me.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.949
Let's go, Lucinda.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.519
You weren't kidding.
They really don't get along.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.455
Oh, maybe I should've
only invited one of them.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.956
If they're your
best friends,

05:24.958 --> 05:26.992
you were right
to invite them both.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.927
I won't let them
ruin your special day.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.595
Don't worry.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.930
Thanks, Sofia.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.965
WOMAN: Time to start
the ceremony, witches.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.769
- Oh, Sofia.
- Hi. Mrs. Wicked Witch.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.806
I'm so glad you could
make Lucinda's big day.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.774
You ready, honey wart?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.710
As much as
I'll ever be.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.812
Welcome,
young witchlings,

05:46.814 --> 05:49.114
to Lucinda's cauldronation!

05:49.116 --> 05:51.950
The ritual will begin
with Lucinda lighting

05:51.952 --> 05:54.186
the cauldronation candle.

05:55.155 --> 05:57.656
Okay. Here goes.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.659
Fire, fire,
burning bright,

06:00.661 --> 06:02.861
ignite the candle's
light tonight.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.899
Oh, that's a good shot.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.838
So is that one.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.707
Mom! The ceremony.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.242
In a second, sweetie.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.010
I just want to capture
every witchy moment

06:19.012 --> 06:19.845
of this special
witchy day.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.680
Now give me your best

06:21.682 --> 06:23.181
"I'm almost a midnight
witch" smile!

06:23.183 --> 06:24.983
Perfect.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.686
Now then, it's
cauldronation
tradition

06:27.688 --> 06:30.856
for everyone to help
gather straw from
a scarecrow

06:30.858 --> 06:34.059
for Lucinda to use
in her raven catcher broom.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.429
To the pumpkin patch,
you darling doers of magic!

06:37.431 --> 06:39.831
Hey, Luce, I'll pick enough
straw for ten brooms,

06:39.833 --> 06:41.566
'cause I'm a great friend,

06:41.568 --> 06:43.869
which means I'll be
a great witch of honor.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.404
That's so sweet.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.773
But if I pick more straw,
would that make me

06:47.775 --> 06:50.776
an even better
witch of honor?
Probably!

06:50.778 --> 06:52.077
Hey!

06:52.079 --> 06:54.513
Oh, no, there
they go again.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.716
It's okay. I think
I know a way to
keep them apart

06:57.718 --> 06:59.785
so there won't
be any problems.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.521
Wait. Indigo.
Let Lily have
that scarecrow.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.890
Then you can have
that bigger one
all to yourself.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.526
It has lots more
straw to pick.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.927
Hm, good idea.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.262
Come on,
girls.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.097
- Nice going.
- Thanks.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.100
Lucinda dear,
while everyone's
picking straw,

07:15.102 --> 07:18.069
let's set out the ingredients
for your cauldronation potion.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.371
Okay, Mom.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.906
I'll go make sure
everything's okay

07:20.908 --> 07:22.174
between Indigo
and Lily.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.711
Oh, hold that pose.
I want to get a picture.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.547
Say rotten cheese.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.382
Rotten cheese.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.752
Oh, spider fritters.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.754
Your eyes were closed.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.656
Could you pose again?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.558
And this time, lean in
a bit closer

07:39.560 --> 07:42.227
to that bottle
of bat sweat, okay?

07:42.229 --> 07:45.397
( sighs )
Rotten cheese.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.902
So far so good.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.771
Everyone's getting along.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.739
My best friend will have
the best broom

07:54.741 --> 07:56.842
with all this straw
I got her.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.911
Then she'll definitely
make me her witch of honor.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.881
Not if I have anything
to hex about it.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.017
Wake up-eus!

08:09.089 --> 08:12.891
Oh, no! Indigo,
what did you do?

08:14.928 --> 08:18.763
( gasps )
That's rude, Mr. Scarecrow!

08:18.765 --> 08:22.100
This straw is for
my best friend, Lucinda.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.538
You've got to stop this.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.540
No, I don't think so.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.175
Awesome hex.
Way to go, me.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.780
Aren't you tired,
Mr. Scarecrow?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.818
Don't you wanna
sit down?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.654
SOFIA: They're heading for
Lucinda's backyard.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.457
That scarecrow could wreck
all the decorations.

08:45.459 --> 08:46.858
We've got to do
something.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.394
Now say icky, stinky cheese.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.630
Icky stinky cheese.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.499
What a darling shot.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.067
Oh, I know the perfect
spot to hang this.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.969
Right by
the broom closet.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.304
Back in a flash.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.907
LILY:
This hay is Lucinda's.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.176
Enough. It's not
polite to grab.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.811
Uh-oh.

09:06.813 --> 09:10.081
Please, Mr. Scarecrow,
this is not funny.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.083
Lucinda's ingredients.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.219
She needs those
to make her potion.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.187
Now unhex that scarecrow.

09:16.189 --> 09:19.090
Ugh! Okay.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.000
Sorry, Lucinda.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.037
It's okay. I'm just glad
you got it to stop.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.873
I found an even better
spot for the picture.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.075
In the divining room.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.511
Oh, looky, it's almost
moonrise.

09:39.513 --> 09:43.048
Come, girls. It's time for
the broomstick dance.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.350
Bring all the straw
you collected.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.487
( frustrated groan )

09:53.093 --> 09:55.460
Did you see the way
that they looked at
each other?

09:55.462 --> 09:58.229
It was hard to miss.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.865
What are they going to do
when I choose one of them
for my witch of honor?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.701
Well, whoever you
don't choose

10:02.703 --> 10:05.203
will just have to be
okay with it.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.205
Now, my witchlets,

10:07.207 --> 10:10.775
it's time for you to do
the traditional broomstick dance

10:10.777 --> 10:12.477
around this broomstick

10:12.479 --> 10:14.646
while Lucinda recites
the spell

10:14.648 --> 10:17.382
that will give her
raven catcher broom its magic.

10:17.384 --> 10:21.653
Good. Everyone split up
into pairs of two for the dance.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.655
Pairs of two.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.925
Lily, Indigo, why don't
you two dance together?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.660
Are you serious?

10:28.662 --> 10:30.161
You cannot
be serious.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.630
Seriously?

10:31.632 --> 10:33.565
Keeping them apart
didn't work.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.634
Maybe if they do
something fun together,

10:35.636 --> 10:37.402
they might get along.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.437
I guess it's
worth a try.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.907
Okay, yes. I'd love
you two to dance together.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.578
And it is
my cauldronation, so...

10:46.580 --> 10:49.914
All right, fine.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.651
Let the broomstick dance
begin!

10:52.653 --> 10:56.154
¶ ¶

11:04.031 --> 11:06.765
¶ Now is the time
in the cauldronation ¶

11:06.767 --> 11:09.167
¶ When we dance around
in celebration ¶

11:09.169 --> 11:11.169
¶ A little witchy groove ¶

11:11.171 --> 11:13.772
¶ Full of eerie spooky moves ¶

11:13.774 --> 11:16.474
¶ Come swirl with us
and twirl with us ¶

11:16.476 --> 11:19.344
¶ Join this magic
dance sensation ¶

11:19.346 --> 11:21.680
¶ It's the broomstick dance ¶

11:21.682 --> 11:24.783
¶ Full of spells and chants ¶

11:24.785 --> 11:27.552
¶ If all goes
without a hitch ¶

11:27.554 --> 11:30.321
¶ Soon we'll have
a midnight witch ¶

11:30.323 --> 11:33.324
¶ The broomstick dance ¶

11:33.326 --> 11:35.126
¶ The broomstick
dance ¶

11:35.128 --> 11:36.961
¶ Dance! ¶

11:36.963 --> 11:39.397
It looks like they're
getting along, doesn't it?

11:39.399 --> 11:43.301
I don't believe it,
but it really does.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.673
¶ Now we skip to the left
and slide to the right ¶

11:48.675 --> 11:51.342
¶ As the day slips away
into the night ¶

11:51.344 --> 11:53.978
¶ Let's dance around
her stick ¶

11:53.980 --> 11:56.314
¶ Do a spell
with a little kick ¶

11:56.316 --> 11:59.517
¶ To give this broom
some extra zoom ¶

11:59.519 --> 12:05.256
¶ So we can fly at
the speed of light ¶

12:05.258 --> 12:06.558
¶ It's the broomstick dance ¶

12:06.560 --> 12:10.395
¶ Full of spells
and chants ¶

12:10.397 --> 12:13.331
¶ If all goes
without a hitch ¶

12:13.333 --> 12:15.600
¶ Soon we'll have
a midnight witch ¶

12:15.602 --> 12:18.369
¶ The broomstick dance ¶

12:18.371 --> 12:20.605
¶ The broomstick
dance ¶

12:20.607 --> 12:22.373
¶ The broomstick dance ¶

12:22.375 --> 12:24.709
Lucinda honey,
the moon will be out soon.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.211
Cast the spell.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.746
Okay, Mom.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.181
Broom of speed,
fast in flight--

12:30.183 --> 12:32.617
Oh, Lucy-woosey,
don't you want

12:32.619 --> 12:36.221
your witch of honor
to be a fabulous broomstick
dancer like me?

12:36.223 --> 12:39.424
You call those dance moves?
Watch these.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.393
Cut it out, guys.
I'm trying to do my spell.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.195
Lucinda, hurry.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.396
Okay.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.465
Whistling thistles, uh...

12:47.467 --> 12:48.900
bristles of hay... whoa!

12:48.902 --> 12:50.268
Keep going, Lucinda.

12:50.270 --> 12:54.806
Full of magic,
pep and might?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.775
- Look at me, Lucinda.
- No, look at me.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.544
How about we just stick to
the basic broomstick dance?

12:59.546 --> 13:02.614
Rise up to the broom
and stick on okay.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.093
( all gasping )

13:15.095 --> 13:16.995
My broomstick!

13:16.997 --> 13:19.898
I was supposed to say
stick where ye may.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.267
Ugh! I said it wrong.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.435
Now I'm gonna have
a crooked raven catcher

13:24.437 --> 13:27.238
for the rest of
my life.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.440
It'll be all right, honey.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.442
I like your broomstick.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.878
It's unique,
just like you.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.983
( moans )

13:38.985 --> 13:40.919
It's okay,
Lucy-woosey.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.454
Yeah, that broomstick
is pretty wicked.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.257
I don't mean to nudge, but it's
getting later by the minute.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.626
I think you should pick your
witch of honor now, Lucinda.

13:48.628 --> 13:52.430
Finally. Okay, Lucinda's gonna
pick her witch of honor now.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.801
So, Lucinda,

13:56.803 --> 13:59.204
who are you
going to choose?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.538
I'm... I'm not sure.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.007
Come on, Lu,
it's an easy choice.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.443
Remember all the bad hexes
we did together?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.846
But you're a good witch
now, Lucindy,

14:07.848 --> 14:10.315
so you should have
a good witch of honor.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.116
Me!

14:12.118 --> 14:14.586
- Um, Lucinda.
- ( gasps )

14:16.356 --> 14:18.556
- Who's it gonna be?
- Yes, who?

14:18.558 --> 14:20.325
Okay, okay.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.260
I choose...

14:23.330 --> 14:25.663
- I choose Sofia.
- Her?
- Huh?!

14:25.665 --> 14:26.731
Me?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.499
What are
you thinking?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.902
Can a non-witch even be
the witch of honor?

14:32.405 --> 14:35.874
Well, nothing in
the cauldronation handbook

14:35.876 --> 14:39.377
says a witch of honor
must be a witch.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.746
Hm. Sofia it is.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.915
But Lucinda,

14:43.917 --> 14:46.651
I don't know the first thing
about being a witch of honor.

14:46.653 --> 14:49.554
I know, but I didn't
want Lily and Indigo

14:49.556 --> 14:52.190
to start the hex-off
of the century.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.192
Everyone,
the moon is on the rise.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.261
Please head over
to the cauldron.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.532
I'm sorry. I really didn't
think she'd choose me.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.401
Hm!

15:04.771 --> 15:08.006
Now Lucinda, with help from
her witch of honor Sofia,

15:08.008 --> 15:11.442
will perform the final
step of the cauldronation.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.578
They'll brew a potion
that will complete

15:13.580 --> 15:15.546
her raven catcher broom.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.249
But first, Lucinda,
let's get one quick shot

15:18.251 --> 15:20.585
of you with your
super special witch of honor.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.022
Oh, spider socks.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.456
I'm out of canvases.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.926
There's more inside.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.695
What do I do?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.430
Start stirring
with the broom,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.832
and remember to keep
stirring as the moon rises.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.775
Like this?

15:43.777 --> 15:45.410
Yes. If all goes well,

15:45.412 --> 15:47.412
the potion will put
a headpiece on the broom

15:47.414 --> 15:49.447
in the shape of
my favorite animal,
an owl.

15:51.318 --> 15:54.786
Now I will add
one speckled owl feather.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.455
Two drops of
slug slime.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.459
One wolf whisker.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.062
A sprig of swamp moss.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.230
Four knuckleberries.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.468
That princess stole
my best friend.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.004
You mean my best friend?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.073
I think it's time
she goes back to her castle.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.641
Wait, Indigo!

16:18.611 --> 16:21.012
Powers that be,
heed what I say.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.448
Send that princess
far away.

16:23.450 --> 16:27.652
What's happening?
Get me down!

16:27.654 --> 16:31.789
- Sofia!
- Time to go bye-bye, princess.

16:31.791 --> 16:35.460
Indigo, that's Lucinda's
raven catcher broom.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.663
Don't worry, Lucindy.
I'll get it back for you.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.598
Turn that princess
right around.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.899
Help!

16:43.770 --> 16:45.303
Oh, no, you don't.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.438
That princess who should
never have been named

16:47.440 --> 16:49.874
witch of honor
is out of here.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.276
I'm not a real witch!

16:52.278 --> 16:54.379
I don't know how
to steer this thing.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.481
But Lucindy needs
that broom.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.217
Get me down!

16:59.219 --> 17:01.619
Watch out!

17:03.123 --> 17:05.123
I got more canvases.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.591
( screaming )

17:08.495 --> 17:09.927
- Uh-oh.
- Watch it.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.031
Oh, my!

17:15.502 --> 17:17.135
I'm okay.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.337
But they're not.

17:19.339 --> 17:20.538
( all hooting )

17:20.540 --> 17:22.974
Ha! You're an owl.

17:22.976 --> 17:26.310
- Uh-oh.
- Yep, you are, too.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.179
( hooting )

17:28.181 --> 17:29.680
Great goblins!
( hoots )

17:29.682 --> 17:31.916
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.085
- Oh, no!
- What happened?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.988
The potion was supposed to
put an owl headpiece
on my broom,

17:36.990 --> 17:39.590
not turn everyone
into owls.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.493
My cauldronation
is ruined.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.862
Now I'll never be
a midnight witch.

17:44.864 --> 17:47.799
Lucinda, wait!
I can fix this.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.604
If only I could pick up
my wand.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.040
Nice going.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.544
Me? I was trying
to stop you and
your mean hex.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.512
Stop. Enough!

18:01.514 --> 18:03.614
Both of you,
you've spent
this whole day

18:03.616 --> 18:06.017
arguing over who is
best friends with Lucinda,

18:06.019 --> 18:08.553
but this is not
how best friends act.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.856
- I just wanted to be
her witch of honor.
- Me, too.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.393
And all Lucinda wanted was for
her cauldronation to go well.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.029
If you really wanted
to act like a good friend,

18:18.031 --> 18:20.364
you would've thought more
about what Lucinda wants,

18:20.366 --> 18:22.600
not about what
you want.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.570
You're right.
We've been so...
so selfish.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.039
Yeah, I guess
we kinda have.

18:28.041 --> 18:30.041
What's even worse is I know
the spell to break

18:30.043 --> 18:31.943
that owl hex, but
I can't use my wand

18:31.945 --> 18:34.612
- with these claws.
- Same goes for me.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.114
Maybe you can do it.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.748
But I'm not a witch.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.317
We'll teach you
the spell.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.052
And show you
how to use a wand.

18:41.054 --> 18:44.689
All right. I'll try,
but we better hurry.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.725
It's just an itsy
flick of the wrist.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.160
Like this?

18:49.162 --> 18:51.162
Now repeat after us:

18:51.164 --> 18:52.930
Wolves that howl,
cats on the prowl...

18:52.932 --> 18:55.633
Wolves that howl,
cats on the prowl.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.769
Bring back the witches
and be gone all these owls.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.572
Bring back the witches
and be gone all these owls.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.616
- You did it, Sofia!
- Way to go!

19:11.618 --> 19:14.018
Good work fixing
one problem, girls.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.087
But what about
Lucinda's potion?

19:16.089 --> 19:18.422
All the ingredients
spilled.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.625
Not to mention this mess.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.326
And the moon's
coming out.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.195
We need a clean-up crew
over here.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.998
The rest of us need to
gather potion ingredients.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.668
It would be so sweet if
you could go find slug slime,

19:30.670 --> 19:33.504
and can you find some essence
of toadstool? Thanks.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.973
Now there's only
one thing missing.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.608
Lucinda.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.681
I'm sorry, Lucinda.

19:43.683 --> 19:46.117
I really tried to keep
Indigo and Lily

19:46.119 --> 19:47.818
from causing trouble.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.620
It's not your fault,
Sofia.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.856
Indigo and Lily
are really great friends.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.192
They're just terrible
when you put them together.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.528
Still, I can't believe
how bad it got.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.464
You know, it may not be
that bad after all.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.033
How can you say that?

20:02.035 --> 20:04.936
Come with me.
I want to show you something.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.706
What's going on?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.208
Here's some
crocodile tears.

20:10.210 --> 20:12.176
New batch of
bat sweat for you.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.245
I got you some
bug broth.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.880
My potion ingredients?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.181
Your friends
did this for you.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.650
It was the least
we could do.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.420
After, you know, ruining
your cauldronation.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.256
We are so,
so sorry.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.991
We spent this whole day
fighting over

20:26.993 --> 20:28.693
who was your
best friend,

20:28.695 --> 20:31.229
and that made us act
like really bad friends.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.231
And not the good
kind of bad, just
the bad kind.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.266
And we feel just awful.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.034
It's okay.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.769
But you're both
my best friends.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.504
I don't want you
to fight over me.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.939
Yeah, we know that now.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.675
Look, Lucinda, the moon's
not totally out yet.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.278
There's still time to
finish your raven catcher.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.214
Only if I get help from
my witches of honor.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.450
All three of you.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.622
This, that, a little bit
of this.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.691
A bit of bug broth,
some croc tears.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.893
Three wolf whiskers.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.894
A touch of toadstool.

21:03.896 --> 21:06.764
The spell, honey,
quickly.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.867
I raise my voice
as the potion is stirred.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.670
Complete this brew
with my favorite bird.

21:27.887 --> 21:31.088
- It worked!
- I did it!
I made a raven catcher.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.790
I'm a midnight witch!

21:32.792 --> 21:35.326
( girls cheering )

21:35.328 --> 21:37.895
- Great job!
- Way to go, Lucinda!

21:37.897 --> 21:39.830
I'm so proud of you,
my darling.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.432
Thanks, Mom.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.834
And I'm sorry about
taking all the pictures.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.003
It's just that, well,

21:46.005 --> 21:48.139
you won't be
my little witchlet much longer,

21:48.141 --> 21:50.341
and I... I want to
remember you

21:50.343 --> 21:52.276
before you fly off
on your own.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.011
It's okay, Mom.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.946
You can take as many
pictures as you want.

21:55.948 --> 21:59.650
You know what? There's no way
I'll forget this moment.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.818
Ever.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.020
Nice job being
witch of honor, Sofia.

22:03.022 --> 22:07.825
You know, you'd make
a really, really good witch.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.027
A good bad witch,
you mean.

22:10.029 --> 22:12.463
If you ever get sick of
the princess thing, that is.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.931
Thank. I'll
keep it in mind.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.766
Ready to take a test ride

22:15.768 --> 22:18.002
on my brand-spanking-new
raven catcher?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.804
So you like that
it's zig-zagged?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.139
Yeah. It's one of a kind.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.543
Oh, and you may wanna
hold on tight, Sofia.

22:25.545 --> 22:29.146
Just how fast does
this thing go?

22:29.148 --> 22:32.683
( Lucinda laughing )
