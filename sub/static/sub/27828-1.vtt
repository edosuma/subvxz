04:37.813 --> 04:39.411
- Did you pay Banos?

04:41.241 --> 04:42.550
Did you?

04:42.550 --> 04:43.545
Has he called you?

04:43.545 --> 04:45.378
- He's tried, alright?

04:47.046 --> 04:49.046
- What are you gonna do?

04:53.088 --> 04:55.149
- Race two, Ballarat.

04:55.149 --> 04:55.982
- That's your plan?

04:55.982 --> 04:56.815
- Yes.

04:57.675 --> 04:58.508
- Are you serious?

04:58.508 --> 05:00.087
- Yes, I'm serious.

05:00.087 --> 05:01.841
Instead of going on about
it, maybe you should put

05:01.841 --> 05:03.758
a buck or two yourself.

05:08.002 --> 05:09.335
Shit, answer it.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.430
- Where are you?

05:14.430 --> 05:15.613
- I'm driving.

05:15.613 --> 05:16.873
- You're meant to be here.

05:16.873 --> 05:18.578
- Yeah I know, I got
stuck in traffic, alright?

05:18.578 --> 05:20.246
It's a bloody nightmare.

05:20.246 --> 05:22.564
- I told you, I wrote it down for you.

05:22.564 --> 05:23.828
- Yeah, I know, I'll be there.

05:23.828 --> 05:25.459
Tell Alex I'm nearby.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.925
- You forgot, didn't you?

05:26.925 --> 05:28.085
- No.

05:28.085 --> 05:29.023
Of course I didn't.

05:29.023 --> 05:31.248
- Jimmy, I can't let you
do this to him anymore.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.119
- That's not what's happening here, OK?

05:33.119 --> 05:34.200
I'll see you soon.

05:34.200 --> 05:35.463
- 10 minutes!

05:35.463 --> 05:36.296
- Yep.

05:38.482 --> 05:40.441
- We're gonna be late for work.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.314
- We'll be five minutes late.

05:42.314 --> 05:44.440
What's Eva doing today,
could she look after Alex?

05:44.440 --> 05:45.710
- She's working a shift,

05:45.710 --> 05:47.051
she's got the kids booked into daycare.

05:47.051 --> 05:49.417
It's just impossible.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.250
Sorry.

05:56.021 --> 05:58.938
She looks really pissed off, Jimmy.

06:08.762 --> 06:10.071
- What is wrong with you.

06:10.071 --> 06:11.658
- I'm sorry I'm late, OK?

06:11.658 --> 06:12.804
- I can't have it, alright Jimmy?

06:12.804 --> 06:14.724
- Yeah, I said I'm sorry.

06:14.724 --> 06:16.435
- I don't want to have to
say this in front of Alex.

06:16.435 --> 06:18.018
- Well then, don't.

06:22.819 --> 06:24.367
- He didn't want to go with you today.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.592
- What are you talking about, he's fine.

06:25.592 --> 06:27.509
- He's not fine, Jimmy.

06:29.140 --> 06:32.648
- I will get every cent
back, I promise you.

06:32.648 --> 06:34.159
- How?

06:34.159 --> 06:34.992
The dogs?

06:35.993 --> 06:36.910
The casino.

06:37.951 --> 06:40.066
If it's not that, it's
blowing it on that stupid car.

06:40.066 --> 06:40.899
- Just...

06:43.660 --> 06:44.993
Have a good day.

06:46.350 --> 06:47.540
- Get his haircut, will you?

06:47.540 --> 06:48.719
He refuses to let me do it.

06:48.719 --> 06:49.702
- Yeah.

06:49.702 --> 06:50.724
- Please, get it cut.

06:50.724 --> 06:51.557
- OK.

06:51.557 --> 06:53.413
- And don't let him play
on your phone all day.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.330
I can't get him off it.

06:59.823 --> 07:01.945
- You wanna start it, mate?

07:01.945 --> 07:03.369
- No.

07:03.369 --> 07:07.522
- Come on, you gotta learn some day, eh?

07:07.522 --> 07:08.355
Come on.

07:11.476 --> 07:12.559
There you go.

07:14.570 --> 07:16.566
Now, you gotta pump it twice before

07:16.566 --> 07:18.566
you turn the key, alright?

07:18.566 --> 07:19.733
Good, turn it.

07:21.710 --> 07:22.543
Hey.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.934
It's good, huh?

07:25.934 --> 07:27.017
Give it some.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.416
Give it some more.

07:30.728 --> 07:31.728
There, good.

07:33.149 --> 07:33.982
Nice.

07:40.081 --> 07:40.946
- Hey.

07:40.946 --> 07:42.495
We'll pick up something on the way, mate.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.683
I'm starving, you?

07:43.683 --> 07:44.539
- Mm-hm.

07:44.539 --> 07:45.940
- Steve, egg and bacon?

07:45.940 --> 07:47.204
- It's gotta be quick.

07:47.204 --> 07:48.121
- Al?

07:49.934 --> 07:52.220
- I don't like Maccas.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.347
- Why not?

07:53.347 --> 07:54.326
- It's not very good for you.

07:54.326 --> 07:57.326
- Yeah, I know mate, but it's quick.

08:00.527 --> 08:02.685
What do want, then?

08:02.685 --> 08:05.295
- An olive bread stick.

08:05.295 --> 08:06.926
- An olive bread stick,
where the hell am I gonna get

08:06.926 --> 08:08.676
an olive bread stick from?

08:17.406 --> 08:18.385
There you go, mate.

08:18.385 --> 08:19.218
- Thank you.

08:19.218 --> 08:20.885
- Olive bread stick.

08:24.581 --> 08:26.436
- So Alex, do you have a girlfriend?

08:26.436 --> 08:27.412
- No.

08:27.412 --> 08:29.324
- A boyfriend?

08:29.324 --> 08:30.157
- Are you serious?

08:30.157 --> 08:32.990
- It's OK, Jimmy, I'm just asking.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.159
- What about that Charlotte girl?

08:38.159 --> 08:38.993
- Um-mm.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.203
- Alex, rock, paper, scissors?

08:45.203 --> 08:46.036
- No, I'm OK.

08:46.036 --> 08:49.262
- Come on, mate, you're
not too old for it.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.516
- B, I was just about to call you.

08:52.516 --> 08:54.235
It's school holidays you
know, I'm running around

08:54.235 --> 08:55.902
like a blue ass fly.

08:57.172 --> 08:58.725
I've got something on
that's gonna square this,

08:58.725 --> 08:59.892
I promise ya.

09:01.414 --> 09:03.414
It's happening today, B.

09:05.860 --> 09:08.027
Then what mate, what is it?

09:11.585 --> 09:12.748
I'll bring it into you, then.

09:12.748 --> 09:15.509
- I want fifteen on my desk
by the end of business today,

09:15.509 --> 09:18.007
do you understand that?

09:18.007 --> 09:21.596
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you, mate?

09:21.596 --> 09:22.900
- Yes.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.752
OK, I hear you, I do.

09:24.752 --> 09:26.169
Look, I gotta go.

09:34.839 --> 09:36.920
- Is he coming?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.036
- He will be.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.216
- Why do you stick up for that bum?

09:39.216 --> 09:40.615
- I'm pretty sure I
still make the decisions

09:40.615 --> 09:42.590
around here or have you forgotten that?

09:42.590 --> 09:43.689
- I think we should bring him in now.

09:43.689 --> 09:45.830
- I don't pay you to
think I pay you to do.

09:45.830 --> 09:49.830
Go do as I tell you and
finish making my coffee.

10:00.116 --> 10:02.234
- Oh come on Jimmy, not a disabled park.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.651
- Let me worry about that, will ya?

10:09.978 --> 10:12.278
- What shifty doctor
did you get that from?

10:12.278 --> 10:14.392
- One that appreciates cars.

10:14.392 --> 10:15.658
- That's so disrespectful, Jimmy.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.735
- What's disrespectful is
people scratching my car.

10:17.735 --> 10:18.958
Stop trying to make me look bad

10:18.958 --> 10:20.643
in front of my kid, will ya?

10:20.643 --> 10:21.990
- You shouldn't do it, Dad.

10:21.990 --> 10:24.281
- Mate, when you love something this much,

10:24.281 --> 10:25.947
you'll understand, alright?

10:25.947 --> 10:26.780
Come on.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.783
- Jim, where've you been.

10:41.783 --> 10:43.781
- One of those mornings.

10:43.781 --> 10:45.045
- This must be Alex.

10:45.045 --> 10:45.878
- Mm-hm.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.411
- He looks just like you.

10:47.411 --> 10:49.603
You better get going, he's not happy.

10:49.603 --> 10:50.436
You should have left 25 minutes ago.

10:55.662 --> 10:57.437
- Yeah that orange flavored vodka.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.359
- You have a big night, boys?

10:59.359 --> 11:00.603
- Yeah, a little bit.

11:00.603 --> 11:02.108
Oi, you got anything on today?

11:02.108 --> 11:03.610
- Nah, nothing on today.

11:03.610 --> 11:05.199
- You always got something on today, Jim.

11:05.199 --> 11:07.901
- You have a good run, ladies.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.504
Jump up there, don't
touch anything, alright?

11:10.504 --> 11:11.337
Nothing.

11:18.805 --> 11:20.229
- Jim.

11:20.229 --> 11:21.062
Jim!

11:27.257 --> 11:28.155
- What?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.177
- What's with the kid?

11:29.177 --> 11:30.117
- What do you mean?

11:30.117 --> 11:31.666
- You can't use our van if
you're taking him with you.

11:31.666 --> 11:32.843
- His name is Alex, Bill.

11:32.843 --> 11:34.276
- We're not insured for Alex,

11:34.276 --> 11:35.945
so you can either go
home or use your own car.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.371
- I can't use my car, my car's a classic.

11:37.371 --> 11:38.758
I'm not using it for deliveries.

11:38.758 --> 11:41.080
- I don't care what it is, work it out.

11:41.080 --> 11:45.247
Otherwise, I get a driver
here to replace you, ASAP.

11:45.439 --> 11:46.272
Where are you going?

11:46.272 --> 11:47.105
- I'll be right back.

11:47.105 --> 11:48.088
- I'm docking your pay.

11:48.088 --> 11:48.921
- Alex!

11:51.025 --> 11:54.208
Fucking miserable piece of shit,

11:54.208 --> 11:56.330
with his dumb red hair.

11:56.330 --> 11:58.162
I can't stand redheads, mate.

11:58.162 --> 12:00.495
It's one thing you'll learn.

12:01.461 --> 12:03.794
- I should have stayed home.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.298
Where are we going?

12:17.298 --> 12:18.965
- Just to a friend's

12:34.363 --> 12:36.287
- Oh, I've got some biscuits.

12:40.665 --> 12:42.835
I hope you like these,
they're my favourites.

12:42.835 --> 12:43.668
- Cool.

12:43.668 --> 12:44.501
- What do you say?

12:44.501 --> 12:45.501
- Thank you.

12:47.724 --> 12:50.223
- Mate, I gotta talk to
Jenny for a second, OK?

12:50.223 --> 12:51.056
- OK.

12:55.179 --> 12:56.613
- He looks just like you.

12:56.613 --> 12:57.696
- Yeah.

13:05.104 --> 13:07.846
- I have to admit I'm a
little surprised to see you.

13:07.846 --> 13:09.605
- I've been so busy at work,

13:09.605 --> 13:11.079
I haven't been doing much at all.

13:14.589 --> 13:18.193
Hey, whatever happened with that fella?

13:18.193 --> 13:19.791
- Nothing much.

13:19.791 --> 13:20.768
- He doesn't know what he's got

13:20.768 --> 13:22.101
in front of him.

13:23.517 --> 13:25.934
- That's a nice thing to say.

13:27.694 --> 13:28.527
You know, I've been meaning

13:28.527 --> 13:29.360
to ask you something.

13:31.257 --> 13:33.796
- What do you mean?

13:33.796 --> 13:37.986
- You come here and we talk about things.

13:38.010 --> 13:41.427
You leave and then you pop back up again.

13:43.583 --> 13:46.523
- Is that a bad thing?

13:46.523 --> 13:47.356
- No.

13:48.401 --> 13:51.021
Just can't work you out.

13:51.021 --> 13:54.253
- I just like talking to you, you know?

13:54.253 --> 13:55.086
- I know.

13:57.973 --> 13:59.941
But that means something, doesn't it?

13:59.941 --> 14:02.274
- Yeah, it does but...

14:14.141 --> 14:15.474
I can't do this.

14:24.749 --> 14:25.582
I just,

14:27.532 --> 14:28.782
I need a favour.

14:29.634 --> 14:31.384
- What is it?

14:32.634 --> 14:35.274
- Could you look after him for the day?

14:35.274 --> 14:36.419
- What about his mum?

14:36.419 --> 14:39.608
- She can't, she's working.

14:39.608 --> 14:40.441
Please.

14:43.289 --> 14:44.122
- OK.

14:47.977 --> 14:48.810
- Thank you.

14:48.810 --> 14:50.478
- I'm not staying here.

14:50.478 --> 14:52.156
- Mate, it's just for a few hours.

14:52.156 --> 14:53.668
- I'm not staying with your girlfriend.

14:53.668 --> 14:54.895
- She's not my girlfriend.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.406
- I'm not fucking staying here!

14:58.406 --> 14:59.307
- Come here.

14:59.307 --> 15:00.557
- Stop!

15:01.971 --> 15:02.804
- Don't you ever talk to me

15:02.804 --> 15:04.401
like that again, OK?

15:04.401 --> 15:05.880
- You're gonna hurt him, get off of him.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.311
- You apologise, apologise to her, now!

15:07.311 --> 15:08.311
- Just stop!

15:09.744 --> 15:10.837
- That was unacceptable!

15:10.837 --> 15:11.959
- I saw you kissing.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.060
- She kissed me.

15:13.060 --> 15:13.922
- I'm telling Mum.

15:13.922 --> 15:16.648
- Mate, there is nothing to
tell your mother, alright?

15:16.648 --> 15:18.325
Don't you dare tell your mother.

15:18.325 --> 15:19.306
I didn't do anything.

15:19.306 --> 15:20.703
- You were going to leave me with her!

15:20.703 --> 15:23.049
- Are you there, are you?

15:23.049 --> 15:24.649
No!

15:24.649 --> 15:26.649
You're here with me.

15:28.624 --> 15:31.168
Jesus, she's just a friend OK?

15:31.168 --> 15:32.001
OK?

15:32.001 --> 15:33.001
- OK.

15:35.390 --> 15:38.616
- I love your mother very much, mate.

15:38.616 --> 15:40.107
You got that?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.543
- Yes.

15:41.543 --> 15:42.376
- Yes.

15:47.599 --> 15:48.988
- Whoa.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.321
How good's that.

16:00.412 --> 16:01.245
Twelve fifteen

16:36.682 --> 16:38.432
- Just wait here, OK?

16:39.459 --> 16:41.351
- What am I gonna do?

16:41.351 --> 16:42.851
- Here, play this.

16:56.841 --> 16:57.758
- Delivery, man.

16:58.853 --> 17:00.770
- Excellent.

17:03.316 --> 17:04.214
Thank you.

17:04.214 --> 17:05.896
- And just sign that.

17:05.896 --> 17:06.813
- No probs.

17:13.421 --> 17:14.608
Al.

17:14.608 --> 17:15.441
Al, mate.

17:16.779 --> 17:18.445
Alex, open the door.

17:21.363 --> 17:24.280
Alex, can you please open the door?

17:27.334 --> 17:28.931
Alex!

17:28.931 --> 17:29.764
Alex!

17:31.101 --> 17:33.187
Alex, open the door!

17:33.187 --> 17:35.068
Open the door, Alex!

17:35.068 --> 17:36.901
Open the fucking door!

17:39.098 --> 17:39.931
Jesus.

17:41.637 --> 17:42.470
Really?

18:10.432 --> 18:11.265
Alex.

18:12.885 --> 18:13.718
Boobs.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.938
It's gonna be a good day, I promise.

18:20.938 --> 18:21.771
OK?

18:23.521 --> 18:24.354
- OK.

18:41.774 --> 18:45.024
- Two secs, mate, don't touch anything.

19:30.382 --> 19:31.215
Hey mate

19:37.065 --> 19:37.898
Cool, have a good day mate.

19:37.898 --> 19:38.731
You too mate

20:05.020 --> 20:07.103
Alex, get your hands out.

20:17.498 --> 20:18.336
- Hello, mate.

20:18.336 --> 20:19.169
- Hello.

20:19.169 --> 20:20.010
- How are you, good?

20:20.026 --> 20:20.877
- Good.

20:20.901 --> 20:21.769
- You like peas?

20:21.769 --> 20:22.602
- Yeah.

20:22.710 --> 20:24.321
- You wanna try? Here.

20:24.321 --> 20:25.321
- Thank you.

20:29.885 --> 20:31.278
- Is everything alright, dear?

20:31.278 --> 20:32.111
- Yeah.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.901
- Hey, boy.

21:02.111 --> 21:03.585
- You alright?

21:03.585 --> 21:05.466
- Yeah.

21:05.466 --> 21:06.966
- Doesn't look it.

21:10.382 --> 21:12.019
- Why didn't you come last week.

21:12.019 --> 21:13.409
- I told you, I had something on,

21:13.409 --> 21:15.256
I couldn't get out of it.

21:15.256 --> 21:16.156
- But you promised.

21:16.156 --> 21:16.989
- I know.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.238
I'm sorry, OK?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.400
Now, what's going on?

21:27.501 --> 21:28.334
- Nothing.

21:32.008 --> 21:33.643
- Al,

21:33.643 --> 21:34.516
come on, mate, tell me.

21:34.516 --> 21:35.849
What's going on?

21:40.575 --> 21:41.908
- I can't sleep.

21:46.587 --> 21:48.837
- You going to bed on time?

21:51.213 --> 21:52.646
- I see a man.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.209
- What?

21:54.209 --> 21:55.068
- I see a man.

21:55.068 --> 21:55.965
- Where?

21:55.965 --> 21:56.965
- In my room

22:00.147 --> 22:02.230
- What does he look like?

22:03.392 --> 22:07.009
- I can't see his face but it
scares me, so I can't sleep.

22:12.349 --> 22:14.341
- I used to have bad dreams.

22:15.207 --> 22:16.558
- When?

22:16.558 --> 22:18.141
- When I was a kid.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.772
The doctor said I had an
over active imagination.

22:23.772 --> 22:24.871
It didn't help though.

22:26.196 --> 22:27.736
- What were you scared of?

22:29.086 --> 22:30.003
- Vampires.

22:32.931 --> 22:37.098
I thought I was gonna
be taking by vampires.

22:37.105 --> 22:41.154
I was so sure of it that I
would practise being frozen

22:41.154 --> 22:43.158
so they'd think I was dead.

22:43.158 --> 22:46.510
And then your grandpa, he said to me:

22:46.510 --> 22:49.054
Vampires hated the sun.

22:49.054 --> 22:53.221
And that in my dreams, I should
turn myself into the sun,

22:54.703 --> 22:56.459
and they would melt away.

22:56.459 --> 22:57.376
- Did they?

23:00.217 --> 23:01.634
- Yeah, they did.

23:05.745 --> 23:07.578
- Where's Grandpa now?

23:10.370 --> 23:12.120
- I don't know, mate.

23:14.745 --> 23:16.328
- When did you last see him?

23:24.927 --> 23:27.260
- When I was about your age.

23:29.882 --> 23:30.948
Good morning.

23:30.948 --> 23:32.362
- Oh, is that my material?

23:32.362 --> 23:33.753
- Feels soft.

23:33.753 --> 23:34.586
- Is this your son?

23:34.586 --> 23:35.419
- Yep.

23:35.419 --> 23:36.474
- You know how many times I told your dad

23:36.474 --> 23:37.747
I'd make him a shirt.

23:37.747 --> 23:38.729
- Next time, I promise.

23:38.729 --> 23:40.653
- That's what he always says.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.858
- What about me?

23:41.858 --> 23:42.759
- Yeah, I can do that.

23:42.759 --> 23:43.810
- Come on, mate, we gotta go.

23:43.810 --> 23:45.529
- Actually, I got some spare on a roll.

23:45.529 --> 23:46.362
- Can I?

23:46.362 --> 23:47.898
- Honestly, I'm probably
gonna throw it away.

23:47.898 --> 23:49.201
- Really?

23:49.201 --> 23:50.756
- Yeah.

23:50.756 --> 23:51.736
Can it be quick.

23:51.736 --> 23:53.371
- Yeah.

23:53.371 --> 23:56.115
Just gonna do your arm now.

23:56.115 --> 23:57.835
Just relaxing.

23:57.835 --> 23:59.216
Just relax your elbow.

23:59.216 --> 24:01.348
Yep, there you go.

24:01.348 --> 24:02.181
Beautiful.

24:04.824 --> 24:05.657
Twenty one.

24:06.913 --> 24:07.746
Alright.

24:08.758 --> 24:10.425
You're done, my man.

24:23.582 --> 24:25.169
- Al, can I have my phone?

24:25.169 --> 24:27.485
- Just a second.

24:27.485 --> 24:29.395
- Come on, mate, I gotta call Steve.

24:29.395 --> 24:31.869
- Just a sec, OK, I need
to finish this level.

24:31.869 --> 24:33.539
- Hurry up, I can't keep him waiting.

24:33.539 --> 24:34.798
- Just wait, OK?

24:34.798 --> 24:37.843
- Don't 'just wait, OK,'
me, give me the phone!

24:37.843 --> 24:38.676
Pick it up.

24:38.676 --> 24:39.879
- I was in the middle of a game.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.270
- Alex, can you please pick up the phone?

24:42.270 --> 24:43.857
- You made me stuff it up!

24:43.857 --> 24:45.443
- Yeah well, I asked you nicely.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.883
- Couldn't you have just waited?

24:47.883 --> 24:49.754
- Who's phone is it?

24:49.754 --> 24:50.587
- Yours.

24:50.587 --> 24:51.788
- Yes.

24:51.788 --> 24:52.924
Who's car is it?

24:52.924 --> 24:53.757
- Grandpa's.

24:53.757 --> 24:57.150
- No, it's mine, now pick
up the goddamn phone!

24:57.150 --> 24:57.983
Jesus.

24:59.383 --> 25:00.216
Thank you.

25:09.894 --> 25:12.144
- Hey, where are you?

25:13.505 --> 25:16.255
Well, hurry up or you'll miss it.

25:20.661 --> 25:22.123
Want a drink or something?

25:22.123 --> 25:22.956
- No.

25:22.956 --> 25:23.789
- You sure?

25:23.789 --> 25:24.622
- Mm-hm.

25:27.076 --> 25:28.993
- What are you playing?

25:30.443 --> 25:31.867
- Run Zombies.

25:31.867 --> 25:33.367
- Run Zombies, Jesus.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.131
Don't you have something
else you can play with?

25:37.131 --> 25:37.964
- Nope.

25:42.854 --> 25:45.604
- Sammy, you got the cards, mate?

25:49.920 --> 25:50.837
Give me that.

25:54.508 --> 25:55.341
OK.

25:56.272 --> 25:57.907
I'm gonna show you a game, OK?

25:57.907 --> 25:59.409
You ever heard of black jack?

25:59.409 --> 26:01.255
- No.
- No, alright.

26:01.255 --> 26:03.632
The aim is to get as
close to 21 as possible

26:03.632 --> 26:04.756
without going over it.

26:04.756 --> 26:05.756
For example:

26:07.084 --> 26:08.594
that's fifteen, yeah?

26:08.594 --> 26:10.553
So kings, queens, jacks, they're all ten.

26:10.553 --> 26:12.280
Aces are either ones or elevens.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.298
So my suggestion is,
you take another card.

26:15.298 --> 26:16.400
- Yep.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.784
- Good.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.431
Three, that's oh, that's eighteen.

26:19.431 --> 26:21.229
That's pretty good, that's nice.

26:21.229 --> 26:22.062
I gotta get over eighteen

26:22.062 --> 26:23.519
but under twenty one to win.

26:23.543 --> 26:25.158
Alright, so if I were you,
I'd sit on that because

26:25.158 --> 26:26.625
you probably won't get a one, two or three

26:26.625 --> 26:28.255
with the next one, you understand?

26:28.255 --> 26:31.740
- Yep, so can I have another card?

26:31.740 --> 26:34.344
- Yeah, you can, but you'll
probably go over twenty one.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.177
- How do you know?

26:35.177 --> 26:37.450
- Because the odds are against you, mate.

26:37.450 --> 26:39.052
- But can I try?

26:39.052 --> 26:41.279
- Yeah, you can try but we're not

26:41.279 --> 26:43.155
betting against anything real, you know?

26:43.155 --> 26:45.500
So you're not feeling the
card, you gotta feel it.

26:46.817 --> 26:49.787
Imagine we're betting for that
soccer ball that you love,

26:49.787 --> 26:51.166
would you take the card or leave it?

26:51.166 --> 26:53.081
- What would happen if
I went over twenty one?

26:53.081 --> 26:55.893
- You lose the ball, mate.

26:55.893 --> 26:56.832
- But I love that ball.

26:56.832 --> 26:57.665
- Yeah.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.910
- But what if I win?

27:00.910 --> 27:03.229
- You get another one, a brand new one.

27:03.229 --> 27:04.066
So you want the card or not?

27:04.066 --> 27:04.899
- Yep.

27:04.899 --> 27:05.732
- Yeah.

27:05.733 --> 27:06.566
- Mm-hm.

27:06.574 --> 27:07.407
- You sure, 100%.

27:07.407 --> 27:08.249
- Yep.

27:08.273 --> 27:09.106
- You're in?

27:09.106 --> 27:09.939
- Yep!

27:15.510 --> 27:18.448
Bum buuuum

27:18.448 --> 27:19.865
It's my ball now.

27:26.191 --> 27:27.978
Lucky we're not playing for real, huh?

27:27.978 --> 27:28.811
- Mm-hm.

27:28.811 --> 27:29.644
- You wanna play again?

27:29.644 --> 27:30.690
- Yep.

27:30.690 --> 27:31.789
- Have I missed it?

27:31.789 --> 27:32.847
- No.

27:32.847 --> 27:33.868
- Are you sure about this?

27:33.868 --> 27:34.847
- 100 percent.

27:34.847 --> 27:35.786
- How can you be so sure?

27:35.786 --> 27:36.847
- I just know.

27:36.847 --> 27:38.463
- OK well, how do you know?

27:38.463 --> 27:39.781
I mean there's like 20 horses up there.

27:39.781 --> 27:41.829
- Jesus, are you trying to jinx me?

27:41.829 --> 27:44.357
There's never anything good
as a dead set certainty,

27:44.357 --> 27:47.012
but this one here, this is
as close as it gets, mate.

27:47.012 --> 27:49.038
- So, are you sure?

27:49.038 --> 27:51.400
- Are you gonna put any
money on this or what?

27:51.400 --> 27:52.642
- Yeah, seventy five, that's all I got.

27:52.642 --> 27:53.865
- Are you serious?

27:53.865 --> 27:56.650
- It's as much as I can afford to lose.

27:56.650 --> 27:58.280
- Seventy five.

27:58.280 --> 27:59.216
- Are you good?

27:59.216 --> 28:00.770
- Yep.

28:00.770 --> 28:01.958
- Do you need a hand?

28:01.958 --> 28:02.791
- No.

28:05.346 --> 28:06.179
Alright.

28:08.111 --> 28:09.861
Big one's ours, mate.

28:39.868 --> 28:40.701
That a boy.

28:40.701 --> 28:42.503
- Come on, eleven.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.253
- Come on, Maddalena!

29:05.942 --> 29:07.165
Get out of there!

29:07.165 --> 29:08.001
- Come on.

29:08.509 --> 29:09.570
- Come on, Maddalena!

29:09.570 --> 29:10.403
- Go, go.

29:14.068 --> 29:15.480
Go, you donkey, go!

29:15.480 --> 29:16.313
- Wait.

29:17.163 --> 29:17.996
Wait.

29:21.712 --> 29:23.053
Wait.

29:24.745 --> 29:26.511
Now, kick it home!

29:49.733 --> 29:51.936
- Maddalena!
- Maddalena!

29:51.936 --> 29:53.582
- Yes, Maddalena!

29:53.582 --> 29:54.665
- Oh, oh yes.

29:55.997 --> 29:58.083
- Oh, you did it.

29:58.083 --> 29:59.166
Look at that.

30:01.922 --> 30:02.839
Go, Maddalena.

30:02.839 --> 30:03.756
Look at me.

30:07.413 --> 30:08.431
- All good?

30:08.431 --> 30:10.510
- Cashed it straight away.

30:10.510 --> 30:11.982
Fifteen to pay back my loan.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.156
And this four, this four thousand

30:14.156 --> 30:16.564
is for you, me and your mom.

30:17.468 --> 30:18.301
- Yes.

30:18.301 --> 30:19.422
- I still can't believe it.

30:19.422 --> 30:21.245
- I told you, I told you, didn't I?

30:21.245 --> 30:23.945
- Yeah I know Jimmy, I don't
know what to say but, you know.

30:23.945 --> 30:25.532
- At your service.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.813
- I've got a few more rounds to do, right,

30:26.813 --> 30:28.441
and you've got to make
that delivery, yeah?

30:28.441 --> 30:29.708
- Yeah, absolutely.

30:29.708 --> 30:31.166
Come on, let's have something
to eat first though, yeah?

30:31.166 --> 30:31.999
Mm-hm

30:31.999 --> 30:33.987
- How about we just meet at
the depot after work, right?

30:33.987 --> 30:35.631
And we can celebrate then, easy.

30:35.631 --> 30:36.484

31:06.683 --> 31:07.986

32:22.382 --> 32:23.972
I'm thinking of her at night and then,

32:23.972 --> 32:27.591
I'm sitting in some shit

What did you win?

34:29.074 --> 34:29.908
- Fourteen hundred.

34:31.149 --> 34:32.149
- I need it.

34:37.679 --> 34:40.203
- Jim, that money is already spent.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.277
I got bills, I gotta get
new beds for the kids,

34:42.277 --> 34:44.067
I just can't do that to them.

34:44.067 --> 34:45.800
- How about this, right?

34:45.800 --> 34:47.839
Give me a thousand, you keep the 400,

34:47.839 --> 34:51.422
I'll fix you up next

34:57.034 --> 34:58.217
- We're mates, right?

34:58.217 --> 34:59.217
- Yes.

35:01.122 --> 35:03.205
- I said I can't do that.

35:04.494 --> 35:05.836
If you ask me again, I'm not gonna wanna

35:05.836 --> 35:07.710
see you anymore.

35:07.710 --> 35:08.960
You understand?

35:13.742 --> 35:15.942
Do you have anything you
can sell, like anything?

35:15.942 --> 35:16.775
- Nup.

35:21.646 --> 35:22.813
I got nothing.

35:33.310 --> 35:34.143
- Jimmy.

35:35.102 --> 35:38.185
- I'm sorry for asking but I have to.

35:41.241 --> 35:42.824
- I feel so stupid.

35:44.048 --> 35:46.041
- Don't do that.

35:46.041 --> 35:47.671
- It's how I feel.

35:47.671 --> 35:48.671
- I'm sorry.

35:52.446 --> 35:54.159
- I can't be this for you anymore.

35:54.159 --> 35:54.992
- What?

35:56.033 --> 35:58.152
- Someone that you would use.

35:58.152 --> 35:59.615
- That's not what this is.

35:59.615 --> 36:01.734
- Then how could you ask
me something like that?

36:01.734 --> 36:03.484
- 'Cause I fucked up.

36:05.727 --> 36:07.977
- I think you should leave.

36:51.541 --> 36:52.374
- Wow.

36:53.215 --> 36:54.382
It's a beauty.

36:56.634 --> 36:57.771
How many owners?

36:57.771 --> 36:59.721
- Just two, me and my father.

36:59.721 --> 37:00.699
- You're kidding.

37:00.699 --> 37:02.005
- No.

37:02.005 --> 37:03.838
Bought her off the floor.

37:05.550 --> 37:06.530
- Has it been in an accident,

37:06.530 --> 37:07.686
been re-sprayed or anything?

37:07.686 --> 37:09.275
- No.

37:09.275 --> 37:10.742
No, it's totally original.

37:10.742 --> 37:13.357
No accident, not a bolt touched.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.661
- Bullshit.

37:14.661 --> 37:16.494
- Have it checked out.

37:17.751 --> 37:18.760
- You know, this is how
they want them these days,

37:18.760 --> 37:20.472
you know that?

37:20.472 --> 37:22.344
- I didn't know.

37:22.344 --> 37:24.429
- It's definitely one for collectors.

37:24.429 --> 37:26.346
- So, you wanna buy it?

37:27.772 --> 37:30.312
- Well, it's no good to the yard.

37:30.312 --> 37:32.556
Why don't you, ah, sell it privately?

37:32.556 --> 37:34.758
- I gotta get rid of it today.

37:34.758 --> 37:36.437
- What do you want?

37:36.437 --> 37:37.270
- I don't know

37:37.270 --> 37:39.511
you'd be lucky to get one
for under $35,000 now.

37:43.210 --> 37:45.206
- Yeah, that's a little rich for me.

37:45.206 --> 37:47.161
- Mate, I've serviced it myself.

37:47.161 --> 37:48.381
I've got the books, the papers,

37:48.381 --> 37:50.902
you will not see one like
this again, I promise ya.

37:50.902 --> 37:51.735
- Yep.

37:57.598 --> 37:59.716
- I'll give you twenty.

37:59.716 --> 38:00.549
- Twenty eight.

38:03.018 --> 38:03.851
- Twenty two.

38:05.011 --> 38:05.844
- Twenty six.

38:09.089 --> 38:13.097
- Twenty five and that's my final offer.

38:13.980 --> 38:15.484
- OK, I want it in cash.

38:15.484 --> 38:16.817
- Cash?

38:18.626 --> 38:21.446
I'll need about 20 minutes to get it.

38:21.446 --> 38:22.279
- OK.

38:23.528 --> 38:25.080
- Alright.

38:25.080 --> 38:25.913
Brilliant.

38:27.016 --> 38:30.642
I'll get the paper work for the transfers.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.683
My wife's gonna kill me, you know.

38:32.683 --> 38:35.602
But my kids, will think
I'm a bloody legend.

38:35.602 --> 38:36.435
Ha ha ha!

38:38.072 --> 38:38.905
Yeah!

39:00.269 --> 39:02.011
Hey, where are you going?

39:02.011 --> 39:03.178
We had a deal!

39:06.764 --> 39:08.057
- No way, mate!

39:08.057 --> 39:09.561
No way, not for him!

39:09.561 --> 39:10.690
- He was so angry!

39:10.690 --> 39:11.980
- Ha, ha, ha, too bad!

39:11.980 --> 39:13.205
- Yeah, too bad.

39:13.205 --> 39:14.038
- There's always a way, mate.

39:14.038 --> 39:15.121
Always a way.

39:22.730 --> 39:24.749
- He's late.

39:24.749 --> 39:27.749
- I'm well aware of the time, Chris.

39:30.695 --> 39:33.262
Go to his house, if he's
not there, go to his work.

39:33.262 --> 39:35.217
If you find him, bring him here.

39:35.217 --> 39:36.725
- Alright.

39:36.725 --> 39:37.907
- And if you don't find him straight away,

39:37.907 --> 39:39.250
just come back.

39:39.250 --> 39:42.500
I mean, who knows, he may just turn up.

40:29.551 --> 40:31.517
- Hey, is Mel in?

40:31.517 --> 40:32.350
- Can I ask your name?

40:32.350 --> 40:34.223
- Yeah it's Jim, she knows me.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.373
- Yeah, just one second.

41:00.828 --> 41:01.995
- Hey love.

41:09.638 --> 41:10.471
- I had no idea who she was talking about.

41:13.063 --> 41:13.896
- Come here.

41:19.304 --> 41:21.522
I can't believe I'm looking at you.

41:21.522 --> 41:22.355
- Same.

41:24.823 --> 41:27.342
- This can't be who I think it is.

41:27.342 --> 41:28.932
- Yep, he's grown.

41:28.932 --> 41:32.441
- You know last time I saw you,
I think you were this high.

41:32.441 --> 41:34.437
- I reckon that would be about right.

41:34.437 --> 41:35.554
- That can't be good.

41:35.554 --> 41:38.167
- Kids change things, huh?

41:38.167 --> 41:40.802
- Yeah, the party certainly stops.

41:40.802 --> 41:43.127
- Yeah, they change
stuff, that's for sure.

41:47.613 --> 41:50.054
- How's that, um,
beautiful woman of yours?

41:50.054 --> 41:51.072
- [She's good.

41:51.072 --> 41:51.905
She's OK.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.996
- You're still working on cars?

41:55.996 --> 41:58.239
- I'm a courier now.

41:58.239 --> 41:59.423
- That's different.

41:59.423 --> 42:01.993
- I had to get off the tools, you know?

42:01.993 --> 42:03.177
What about you?

42:03.177 --> 42:04.340
This is alright?

42:04.340 --> 42:06.909
- Yeah, apart from school
holidays kicking my ass.

42:06.909 --> 42:09.857
Try running a business with these guys.

42:10.824 --> 42:14.000
- Hey Al, go and have a play
with them for a sec mate.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.083
- Yup.

42:26.793 --> 42:29.626
- You're not a cop, are you Jimmy?

42:32.756 --> 42:34.716
- Jesus, Mel.

42:34.716 --> 42:38.880
- I haven't seen you in
years and you just pop in.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.938
- Mel, come on.

42:42.211 --> 42:44.292
No, I'm not a bloody cop, OK?

42:44.292 --> 42:47.475
- Good, 'cause I got a family, now.

42:47.897 --> 42:49.173
- Yeah, I know.

42:49.173 --> 42:50.260
I can see 'em,

42:50.260 --> 42:52.518
you know. So do I,
that's why we haven't...

42:56.576 --> 42:58.726
- I've lost touch with everyone.

42:58.726 --> 43:01.213
You know, you get caught up.

43:01.213 --> 43:04.046
First few years are just nappies and...

43:05.042 --> 43:05.875
shit.

43:05.875 --> 43:06.708
- Tell me about it.

43:06.708 --> 43:07.901
Alex had gastro one time right.

43:07.901 --> 43:10.590
It's three AM and he's spewed all over me.

43:10.590 --> 43:12.953
There's bloody vomit everywhere,
it's all I can smell.

43:12.953 --> 43:15.787
- Two years of daycare, I
don't even wanna tell you.

43:20.553 --> 43:21.386
What?

43:23.778 --> 43:24.945
- I need a loan.

43:26.788 --> 43:27.621
- Jimmy.

43:27.621 --> 43:28.717
- It's just for a couple of weeks,

43:28.717 --> 43:30.430
I promise ya.

43:30.430 --> 43:31.573
- How much?

43:31.573 --> 43:32.490
- Fifteen.

43:33.529 --> 43:35.510
- Jimmy, that's a lot of money.

43:35.510 --> 43:36.343

43:37.334 --> 43:38.556
- When do you need it?

43:38.556 --> 43:40.015
- I need it now.

43:40.015 --> 43:41.348
Today, sometime.

43:46.334 --> 43:47.167
- I can't.

43:48.939 --> 43:49.822
I can't.

44:01.924 --> 44:04.285
I was meant to be out today but I'm stuck

44:04.285 --> 44:06.039
with these guys here.

44:06.039 --> 44:07.460
If you can do some deliveries for me,

44:07.460 --> 44:09.113
I can take care of you.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.754
- I can't, I've got Alex with me.

44:11.754 --> 44:13.679
- They're regulars, it's run of the mill.

44:17.238 --> 44:18.497
- Do you reckon I'll make it?

44:21.205 --> 44:22.122
- I reckon.

44:24.206 --> 44:25.039
You in?

44:27.777 --> 44:29.202
- Yep.

44:29.202 --> 44:30.285
- Wait a sec.

44:49.482 --> 44:51.410
OK, it's mainly one gram, a half ounce

44:51.410 --> 44:53.368
to an ounce bags mixed
together to cover you.

44:53.368 --> 44:54.994
I'll text you the addresses
and everything else you need

44:54.994 --> 44:55.877
is in the bag.

44:55.877 --> 44:56.993
- OK.

44:59.542 --> 45:00.375
- Al.

45:01.675 --> 45:03.578
- Come on, mate.

45:03.578 --> 45:04.719
- Can I get you something for the road?

45:04.719 --> 45:07.244
- No, no, we're fine, thank you.

45:12.327 --> 45:13.364
- Can I get these boys some spanakopita

45:13.364 --> 45:14.756
to go, please?

45:16.033 --> 45:17.214
- What do you say, mate?

45:17.214 --> 45:18.047
- Thank you.

45:18.047 --> 45:20.357
- You're welcome sweetie.

45:20.357 --> 45:21.190
Talk soon.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.169
- Delivery.

46:08.016 --> 46:08.915
- Alex!

46:08.915 --> 46:11.915
I told you to wait outside, come on.

46:24.582 --> 46:26.003
- Oi!

46:26.003 --> 46:26.836
Oi!

46:32.087 --> 46:33.350
- Get out of my fucking life!

46:33.350 --> 46:34.249
- Fuck off!

46:34.249 --> 46:35.082
- Shut up!

46:35.082 --> 46:37.749
Piece of fucking shit, fuck off!

46:40.585 --> 46:41.895
Who are you?

46:41.895 --> 46:43.062
- You want it?

47:07.849 --> 47:09.635
- Dad, do you still have
my Barca soccer ball?

47:10.577 --> 47:11.985
- Yeah, it's at home.

47:11.985 --> 47:13.452
- Can we get it?

47:13.452 --> 47:14.922
- No.

47:14.922 --> 47:16.677
We gotta keep moving.

47:16.677 --> 47:19.286
- But you always forget it.

47:19.286 --> 47:21.045
- I'll bring it next time, alright?

47:21.045 --> 47:21.878
I promise.

47:25.469 --> 47:27.015
- It was the one Mom got me.

47:27.015 --> 47:27.848
- I know.

47:35.658 --> 47:37.082
- Can you stop doing that?

47:37.082 --> 47:37.940
- What?

47:37.940 --> 47:38.773
- The ball.

47:38.773 --> 47:39.898
- Just practising.

47:39.898 --> 47:41.240
- Do you have to do it in the car?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.301
- It's not my fault that I'm stuck

47:42.301 --> 47:43.699
in here all day.

47:43.699 --> 47:44.532
- Stuck.

47:44.532 --> 47:45.573
- Yeah, I'm bored.

47:45.573 --> 47:46.429
- What, with me?

47:46.429 --> 47:48.180
- Yeah, I'm bored and sick of being stuck

47:48.180 --> 47:49.443
in this stupid car all day!

47:49.443 --> 47:51.034

47:51.034 --> 47:53.757
I'm sick of your attitude,
the way you talk to me!

47:53.757 --> 47:57.924
I'm sick of you playing that
piss weak game for girls!

48:01.065 --> 48:02.082
- What are you doing?

48:02.082 --> 48:03.183
- I was nowhere near it.

48:03.183 --> 48:04.365
- I was on the road!

48:04.365 --> 48:06.067
- I wasn't gonna hit ya.

48:06.067 --> 48:06.959

Come on, jump in the car.

49:20.163 --> 49:21.705

49:24.252 --> 49:26.244
- Look, I'm sorry for what I said, OK?

49:28.644 --> 49:29.958
- It's not a game for girls!

49:31.150 --> 49:33.439
I like soccer and I
like being around boys!

49:33.439 --> 49:35.454
- Yeah, it's OK, mate.

49:35.454 --> 49:38.096
You do what you like,
that is all I care about.

49:41.839 --> 49:43.172
I'm sorry, mate.

49:51.979 --> 49:52.812
- Hey.

50:31.474 --> 50:35.019

51:09.509 --> 51:11.586
Fuck it, we're not gonna find anything.

51:11.586 --> 51:12.644
- [Should we wait for him?

51:12.644 --> 51:14.369
- Nah, let's get out of here.

51:22.133 --> 51:23.811
Yeah, he's not here.

51:23.811 --> 51:26.016
What do you want us to do?

51:26.016 --> 51:26.849
Alright.

51:29.037 --> 51:30.220
That place was filthy.

51:30.220 --> 51:31.770
That was a fucking shit hole that joint.

51:32.177 --> 51:34.138
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

51:34.138 --> 51:34.971

51:49.466 --> 51:50.566
- You wanna play on my phone?

51:53.874 --> 51:56.490
Mate, I couldn't get the ball.

51:56.490 --> 51:57.590
- You lost it didn't you?

51:57.590 --> 51:59.017
- No.

51:59.017 --> 52:01.600
- Then why couldn't you get it?

52:02.480 --> 52:04.190
- I can't explain.

52:04.190 --> 52:05.940
- You lost it.

52:09.243 --> 52:11.377
- I saw someone that I
didn't want to speak to.

52:11.377 --> 52:12.210
- Who?

52:12.210 --> 52:13.929
- Just a neighbor that I don't like.

52:15.128 --> 52:15.961
Al,

52:16.917 --> 52:19.092
there are gonna be times when
I can't explain everything

52:19.092 --> 52:19.925
OK?

52:27.904 --> 52:28.821
Can I come?

52:35.002 --> 52:36.024
- Do you want a chocolate?

52:36.024 --> 52:37.291
- No thanks.

52:37.291 --> 52:39.658
- We've always kept
chocolate in the house.

52:39.658 --> 52:42.158
Sometimes it was hidden
but it was always here.

52:48.379 --> 52:49.496
- Is he OK?

52:51.083 --> 52:52.142
- Yeah, he'll be OK.

52:53.854 --> 52:56.013
There's not much more the
doctors can do for him.

53:10.932 --> 53:12.599
- That's not enough.

53:13.869 --> 53:15.990
- That's how much I
was told it would cost.

53:16.598 --> 53:18.015
- I just deliver.

53:20.554 --> 53:21.736
- How much am I short?

53:21.736 --> 53:22.569
- I can't.

53:23.976 --> 53:25.143
OK, I'm sorry.

53:51.181 --> 53:53.097

53:53.097 --> 53:55.003
Vitamin C, what's in
orange juice, you know?

53:55.003 --> 53:56.086
It helps him.

53:59.125 --> 54:00.432
You know what, I'm hungry, you hungry?

56:06.711 --> 56:07.544
Open your mouth.

56:07.544 --> 56:08.931
Hey, stop it, open your mouth.

56:09.998 --> 56:12.081
Turn around, turn around.

56:15.698 --> 56:16.531

56:16.531 --> 56:18.489
- Nothing, he's fine,

56:18.489 --> 56:19.322
- Is he OK?

56:19.322 --> 56:20.688

56:21.463 --> 56:22.713
You're alright, you're alright

56:24.168 --> 56:26.765
- Jesus, what the fuck is this?

56:27.240 --> 56:28.073

56:34.124 --> 56:34.957
- Go, go!

57:05.596 --> 57:08.929
- We're not delivering vitamins, are we?

57:14.937 --> 57:16.687
- No mate, we're not.

57:22.888 --> 57:24.638
- Then what are they?

57:28.232 --> 57:29.565
- They're drugs.

59:26.282 --> 59:28.282

59:37.498 --> 59:41.337
Jimmy, after I take out for the loss...

59:41.337 --> 59:42.170

59:43.869 --> 59:44.702
It's OK.

01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:20.246

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:21.079

01:00:21.079 --> 01:00:21.912
- Twenty minutes.

01:00:21.912 --> 01:00:25.662
I need you to start on
the statesman already!

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.133
Fuck you, Jimmy.

01:00:31.977 --> 01:00:32.810

01:01:45.103 --> 01:01:46.921
Hey Alex, just stay here

01:01:46.921 --> 01:01:47.754
I left something in the car.

01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:49.754
- Alright, cool.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:09.570
- I'm drowning and you
wouldn't even know you...

01:02:17.389 --> 01:02:19.389
I almost lost him today.

01:02:45.193 --> 01:02:46.360
Where are you?

01:02:50.248 --> 01:02:52.610

01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:57.112
You jump in, mate, I'll drop it off.

Steve?

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:55.634

01:05:49.367 --> 01:05:50.656

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:51.500
- Mm-hm.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:52.696
- You can't come out.

01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:54.113
- Why not?

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.460
- Mate, it's a bit tricky.

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.127
- Are these men bad?

01:06:00.883 --> 01:06:01.716
- No.

01:06:03.702 --> 01:06:04.619
Promise me.

01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:07.232

01:06:08.917 --> 01:06:10.000
- Good.

01:06:13.966 --> 01:06:16.216
- Can I play on your phone?

01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:22.348
- It's dead.

01:06:24.119 --> 01:06:25.786
I won't be long, OK?

01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:43.203
- You're late?

01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:47.384
What the hell did you do to your hair?

01:06:50.115 --> 01:06:51.365
- I got it cut.

01:06:53.294 --> 01:06:56.636
- Yeah, you need to get
yourself a new barber.

01:06:56.636 --> 01:06:57.469
- Yeah.

01:06:59.166 --> 01:07:00.282
- Where's my money?

01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:10.059
- What's this?

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:11.892
- It's a down payment.

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.478
- You showed me the
money, you sent me a pic,

01:07:14.478 --> 01:07:15.667
where is it?

01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:16.500
- I lost it.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.103
- You lost it?

01:07:18.103 --> 01:07:20.465
- I was thinking I could win some more.

01:07:20.465 --> 01:07:22.632
- Yeah, of course you did.

01:07:29.037 --> 01:07:31.271
Fuck, this is all my fault.

01:07:32.272 --> 01:07:34.309
I'm responsible because I let you fucking

01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:35.987
get away with it, I'm an idiot.

01:07:35.987 --> 01:07:37.331
- No, that's not what it is, B.

01:07:37.331 --> 01:07:38.838
- All day I've been
thinking, how many years

01:07:38.838 --> 01:07:40.307
have I been looking out for you, huh?

01:07:40.307 --> 01:07:42.589
You learn your trade

01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:45.662

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:46.495
- And now this!

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:47.328
- I know.

01:07:50.255 --> 01:07:51.601
- You know what shit I've got on my head

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:53.334
because of you?

01:07:53.334 --> 01:07:54.600
- I'm sorry.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.131
- And what am I suppose
to do with 500 bucks?

01:07:57.131 --> 01:07:59.540
Am I suppose to lose
everything because of you?

01:08:02.064 --> 01:08:04.314
- There's nothing I can do.

01:09:16.703 --> 01:09:20.854
- Dad!

01:09:24.162 --> 01:09:26.488
- It's yours!

01:09:26.488 --> 01:09:27.322

01:10:01.435 --> 01:10:03.935
It'll cover the debt and more.

We square?

01:10:11.553 --> 01:10:13.577

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.580
'Cause you'll never see again.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:23.208
- Jimmy, I said we're square.

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:26.271

01:10:53.184 --> 01:10:54.434
