WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:07.172
I told you what I had to do.

00:07.174 --> 00:08.674
Derek, I know where you are.
We're coming there now.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.309
Stay away.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.243
Alpha Team on our way.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.512
Bravo on two. East stairs.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.713
You got to trust
yourself, Derek.

00:14.715 --> 00:15.714
You don't want to do this.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.083
No, I don't.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.252
But I have to.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.604
No way.
It's not going to happen.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.205
If you guys want to do this,

00:40.207 --> 00:43.442
you're going to have
to go through me.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.745
All right, bring it.
See what you got.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.814
Go ahead, go pass.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.215
What you got?

00:50.217 --> 00:51.784
Oh, the fake!

00:51.786 --> 00:53.185
What you got?

00:55.489 --> 00:57.489
Oh, nice one!

00:57.491 --> 00:58.824
Schooled me. Good job.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.292
That was good.

01:00.294 --> 01:01.693
Okay, Nash and Shaq, all right.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.063
My dinner's getting cold,
but good teamwork, guys.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.098
Derek.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.789
Mattie, how many times
I got to tell you

01:30.791 --> 01:33.459
to lock the door behind you
when you get home.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.626
Huh?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.829
(crowd cheering loudly
on television)

01:36.831 --> 01:40.099
Mattie, come on,
volume, please.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.601
Hope you're hungry.
I stopped at Burger Shed,

01:42.603 --> 01:45.137
picked you up
a Double Spicy.

01:45.139 --> 01:48.140
Oh, gee, Derek, thanks, man.
My favorite.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.442
I mean, I know you
had classes all day.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.479
And you gotta work
at the hospital
in a few hours--

01:53.481 --> 01:55.881
but, hey, thanks, man.

01:55.883 --> 01:56.815
Wow.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.650
You can have some fries,

01:58.652 --> 02:00.686
but you got to finish
your salad first.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.588
And then I want
to see some homework.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.755
I'm not hungry.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.859
Not hungry?

02:06.861 --> 02:08.627
You okay?

02:08.629 --> 02:11.163
What's wrong?

02:11.165 --> 02:12.764
You sick?

02:16.637 --> 02:17.769
Mattie, what happened?!

02:17.771 --> 02:19.471
Nothing.
What do you
mean nothing?!

02:19.473 --> 02:20.372
Don't tell me nothing!

02:20.374 --> 02:21.773
What happened?!
Nothing.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.609
It was an accident.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.280
Mattie, talk to me.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.581
Come on, it's
a bullet wound.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.617
I know a bullet wound
when I see one.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.352
(yelling)

02:33.354 --> 02:35.354
Got to get you
to the hospital.
No, I can't go to the hospital.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.756
If the cops find out...
If you don't go
to the hospital,

02:37.758 --> 02:39.424
this could open up
and you'll bleed to death.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.426
I'm not going.
I'm not going.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.828
We're going.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.564
All right, hold on.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.699
MAN:
Tug man, move your ass.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.701
What?
It's Shane, It's Shane.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.937
It's Shane.
Go, go, go, go.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.207
MAN:
What floor you
say he's at?

02:55.209 --> 02:56.608
Eight I think.
You think?

02:56.610 --> 02:58.744
I mean, yeah, eight.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.345
All right, come on.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.281
(muffled groan)

03:03.851 --> 03:04.783
Shane Thomas.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.218
He shot you.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.819
What the hell you
doing with him, Mattie?

03:07.821 --> 03:10.255
With all that we
have been through,

03:10.257 --> 03:12.257
tell me you're not
running with these guys.
I'm sorry, D.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.893
You've been working so hard
and I wanted to help...

03:14.895 --> 03:15.894
Come on, Mattie.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.362
When you was my age,

03:17.363 --> 03:18.829
you was already running
with the East Side Crew.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.499
Yes, and look
where that got us.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.935
I'm sorry, all right?
It was an accident, I swear.

03:22.937 --> 03:25.237
Derek, we can't
tell nobody.
Derek, please.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.806
I know someone at the hospital
who can help us.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.675
All right?

03:29.677 --> 03:30.809
I got your back.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.411
You got my back.

03:33.647 --> 03:38.217
WORDY:
Let's do it on three.
Ready? One...

03:38.219 --> 03:39.851
Two...

03:40.621 --> 03:42.621
You're not doing it right.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.622
I'm doing it how
you told me to do it.

03:44.623 --> 03:46.623
No, you're doing it like
someone who didn't listen
to how I told him to do it.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.894
Okay.
Communication,
repetition, affirmation.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.829
The secret to
every great marriage.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.231
(laughing)

03:52.233 --> 03:53.999
Boss, we up for a drink
tonight, or what?

03:54.001 --> 03:55.701
I can't.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.970
I got to finish this article--
Critical Incidence newsletter.

03:57.972 --> 04:00.572
Who says Greg Parker doesn't
know how to have a good time.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.274
Spike.
(mechanical whirring)

04:02.276 --> 04:03.909
I don't get it.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.844
I gave her a new gyro
just last week.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.713
I thought we were good.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.581
Maybe it's not you,
maybe it's her.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.452
Officer Callaghan,
how you doing?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.953
You really want to know?

04:14.955 --> 04:18.023
Well, unless the answer
is "outstanding," not really.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.392
I get it.

04:20.393 --> 04:21.893
I mean, eight gun calls,
two warrants a day--

04:21.895 --> 04:22.928
it's exhausting.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.931
(footsteps approaching)

04:25.933 --> 04:27.399
What?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.901
It's been a long week.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.536
Copy that.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.041
But it's what we do
though, right?
Yep.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.588
He's gone, man.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.823
I can see that.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.695
Looks like you tagged
him pretty good.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.431
Obviously not good enough.
Yo, give me
some of that.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.967
Man, it's a Spicy Burger. You
don't even eat Spicy Burgers.
Don't tell me I don't eat...

05:01.969 --> 05:03.669
Y'all shut up?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.671
God!

05:05.673 --> 05:08.340
Yo, I say we wait
for him here, man.

05:08.342 --> 05:10.542
Whatever. Shane what
do you want to do?

05:10.544 --> 05:13.345
it ain't about what I want.
The kid's a loose end.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.646
Yeah, the kid's a loose end.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.714
So?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.015
So we chill.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.984
Wait for him
to come home.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.453
Uh-uh.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.754
We're going to him.

05:35.369 --> 05:37.836
It's okay. Come on.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.941
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Odell to cardiology.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.609
You all right, buddy?

05:44.611 --> 05:45.544
Hold on.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.346
Let's go find Trudy.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.487
Trudy.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.022
Hey, you're early.
Trudy, listen...

05:57.024 --> 05:59.124
Are you Mattie? Your brother
talks about you all the time.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.659
Listen, I need a favor.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.728
What's wrong?

06:02.730 --> 06:05.564
Can you just look
at my little brother, please?

06:05.566 --> 06:07.866
But I need you
to keep it quiet.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.134
He's been shot.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.669
What?!

06:10.671 --> 06:12.571
He was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.574
D, what's going on?
Can we just fix him up
and get him out of here?

06:15.576 --> 06:17.576
Gunshots have to be reported.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.144
Tru, I can't do that.
You know how it works.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.613
You said you were done
with all that.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.582
He didn't do anything.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.950
It's okay.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.052
Look, I just need you
to trust me.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.922
He's my little brother.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.458
I can't have Social Services
take him away from me.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.731
Please.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.001
This needs sutures.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.469
We need a doctor.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.171
Uh-uh. Can't do that.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.706
Derek...

06:47.708 --> 06:50.942
Hey, I will make it up
to you big time.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.980
Supply room in E wing.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.948
Get me some butterfly bandages
and some saline.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.484
We're going to have
to flush it out.
Okay.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.986
Just don't let anybody
see you, okay?

07:00.988 --> 07:02.888
Oh, don't worry.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.790
Hey.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.058
Be back, okay?

07:07.060 --> 07:08.827
Make it up to you big time?

07:08.829 --> 07:11.163
Quiet.

07:37.090 --> 07:40.725
Dr. Barnes, call 214.
Dr. Barnes...

07:49.536 --> 07:50.602
Hey!

07:54.141 --> 07:55.173
Derek...

07:55.175 --> 07:57.976
Mattie, get
the hell out of here!

07:58.779 --> 08:01.079
(gunshot)

08:04.751 --> 08:06.151
Matt...

08:06.153 --> 08:07.619
Trudy!

08:07.621 --> 08:10.655
Can we get some help
here please?!

08:10.657 --> 08:11.857
Help!

08:11.859 --> 08:14.092
Tru, Tru...

08:14.094 --> 08:16.161
Tru, I'm so sorry.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.162
Tru.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.830
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.199
Get some pressure dressing.
Got it, got it.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.235
Let's clear Trauma One now.

08:23.237 --> 08:24.970
Sir, sir, give us some room.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.671
We've got some work
to do here.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.540
Code red. Code red. O.R.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.608
Mattie!

08:32.513 --> 08:34.913
(alarm blaring)
Team One, hot call.
Shots fired.

08:34.915 --> 08:35.981
Saint Patrick's Hospital.
Once staff member down--

08:35.983 --> 08:37.148
critical condition.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.284
Active shooter at large.

08:46.793 --> 08:50.862
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:22.296 --> 09:24.029
(sirens wailing)

09:39.947 --> 09:42.047
PARKER:
Jules, you spent a lot of time
here after you got shot.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.750
You good?
Yeah, kind of hoping not to see
this place again so soon.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.187
Uncontrolled entrances,
hundreds of rooms.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.656
Pete, we've got a major
containment challenge here,

09:51.658 --> 09:54.125
and we need all the extra
uniforms we can get.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.060
Metro's sending
everyone they have.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.861
Calling people off shift.

09:56.863 --> 09:57.929
Good. Put Team Four
on alert.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.164
And let's reach out
to our neighbors

09:59.166 --> 10:01.216
in York and Durham regions,

10:01.217 --> 10:03.267
see if they can spare any
brothers and sisters in blue.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.869
Copy.
What do you got?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.488
Hospital's in
partial lockdown.

10:06.489 --> 10:08.106
Uniforms are checking people
coming in and out.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.774
Not all the entrance points
have been covered yet.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.042
Not enough bodies.
Reinforcements
on their way.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.644
How long since our shooter's
been active?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.045
They said 12 minutes of quiet.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.814
Quiet is good.
We like quiet.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.682
Jules, talk to any contacts
you might have in there.

10:17.684 --> 10:19.651
We need more intel here.
Got it.

10:19.653 --> 10:22.120
Pete, you got the name
of the nurse that got shot?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.755
Trudy Vargas.
I know her.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.924
Okay, let's see what kind
of shape she's in.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.993
Maybe she can tell us
what happened.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.298
I understand, but there are
armed men in my emergency room

10:33.300 --> 10:35.333
getting in the way of patients
who need treatment.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.901
Now who's in charge?
I am.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.370
Sergeant Greg Parker
with the SRU.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.238
Dr. Redfield.
Hi, Doctor.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.173
We need to set up
a command post.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.242
Okay, you can do that
in the admit office.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.012
It's just through the E.R.
I'll take you.
Thank you.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.279
How's Trudy Vargas doing?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.764
We're stabilizing her.

10:49.765 --> 10:51.248
She's going to OR
in a few minutes.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.819
It would help us if we could
have a word with her.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.254
Don't get in the way,
don't stay too long.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.355
That's her right there.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.424
We tried to contain
the panic, but...

10:59.426 --> 11:02.727
But gunshots are loud,
word gets around.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.295
What if we evacuate
the hospital?

11:04.297 --> 11:07.198
400 patients? Ten in surgery as
we speak, another dozen in ICU.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.734
Now one of my best nurses
is out commission. No way.

11:09.736 --> 11:11.870
What if we put the patients
in a secured area

11:11.872 --> 11:12.871
with lockable doors?

11:12.873 --> 11:14.039
Sounds like a plan.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.774
You'll need to close shop
for a while.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.242
Already rerouting calls
to the Mount,

11:17.244 --> 11:18.877
but they're at capacity
as it is.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.146
I set up a triage area
in the west parking lot

11:21.148 --> 11:22.280
for more critical cases.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.848
I know it's not ideal.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.051
City hospital, Sarge.
It's never ideal.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.218
Through there to the right.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.286
Thank you, Doctor.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.988
All right, good luck.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.689
Excuse me. I got to get back
to my team.

11:31.692 --> 11:35.160
Kinda reminds me of you.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.128
Really?
A little bit.

11:37.130 --> 11:41.800
WOMAN (over P.A.)
Dr. Rawlins, to Radiology.
Dr. Rawlins, to Radiology.

11:43.270 --> 11:46.404
Shane, man, Five-O's all
over the place, man.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.440
We should bail.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.477
Give me your nine.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.812
My nine?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.380
But there's cops...
Man, give it to him.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.254
I know the kid saw
what you did, but...

12:03.256 --> 12:05.140
What I did?!
What I did?!

12:05.141 --> 12:07.025
You better believe anyone finds
out, we're all going down.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.144
What, you think Mattie's
gonna go to the cops?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.262
The cops?! I don't care anything
about the damn cops, all right?!

12:11.264 --> 12:13.098
Those...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.201
We need

12:16.203 --> 12:18.336
to silence that kid,
you understand me?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.039
We need to do it now
before he talks to anyone.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.907
You think he talked
to his brother?

12:22.909 --> 12:27.245
Well, if he did, then, uh...
we gotta take care of him, too.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.182
You got
a better idea?

12:31.184 --> 12:34.319
All right then.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.287
(chambers round)

12:40.494 --> 12:41.893
Hector!

12:41.895 --> 12:43.194
Mattie, you okay?
Yeah, yeah.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.929
All right.
We gotta get outta here.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.998
There's too many cops.
We can't.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.269
Okay. Uh, upstairs.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.239
5:17 P.M.
Establishing command post.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.208
Single shot fired, gunman
at large, but gone to ground.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.277
We got a central building,
four wings.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.412
Ten floors,
16 stairwells.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.382
North wing, most vulnerable
patients: ICU and Maternity.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.117
Lewis, Wordy,
you guys cover ICU.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.019
LEWIS:
Copy.

13:08.020 --> 13:09.920
Sam and I'll go take Maternity,
work our way downwards.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.290
Clear each floor
till we flush the subject out.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.259
Leave a uniform sentry behind
each secured area

13:14.261 --> 13:16.261
after we've cleared it, okay,
so it stays that way.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.862
Spike, any visuals
on our shooter?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.230
Sorry, boss.
Limited camera coverage.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.266
He must have been
in a blind spot.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.401
Okay, that's not a lot to go on
here, gentlemen,

13:23.403 --> 13:24.969
so let's make the priority
anyone not wearing

13:24.971 --> 13:27.005
a hospital gown
or a uniform, okay?

13:27.007 --> 13:28.106
Let's get this guy

13:28.108 --> 13:29.474
while he's still quiet.
Copy that.

13:31.511 --> 13:37.382
There. That should
hold for now, anyway.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.383
What are we gonna do?

13:38.385 --> 13:40.385
DEREK:
I don't know yet!
Hey!

13:40.386 --> 13:42.386
Mattie, what the hell is Shane
and his boys after you for?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.255
I'm tired of this!
What did you do?

13:44.257 --> 13:45.256
Nothin'.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.258
Nothing?

13:47.260 --> 13:50.195
Put these on.
We gotta blend.

13:50.197 --> 13:52.264
These are girls.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.332
You worried about the clothes?
They're trying to kill you,

13:54.334 --> 13:57.202
and you're worried
about the clothes?!

13:57.204 --> 13:59.938
And they shot my friend
who was just trying to help us!

13:59.940 --> 14:01.272
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.608
Look, Mattie, you need
to start talking to me.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.610
What's going on?

14:05.612 --> 14:07.345
Shane wouldn't be coming
at you like this

14:07.347 --> 14:08.880
unless it was
something serious.

14:08.882 --> 14:11.115
I didn't steal anything!

14:11.117 --> 14:12.550
I didn't do
anything.

14:12.552 --> 14:16.020
You saw something, didn't you?

14:16.022 --> 14:19.390
Did he pop somebody?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.459
Mattie?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.494
Yeah.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.463
Yeah.
(door opens)

14:26.867 --> 14:29.167
He said he's
gonna kill me.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.036
He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.204
He's gonna kill...

14:33.206 --> 14:35.373
Mattie, Mattie,
Mattie, Mattie, relax.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.109
He's not gonna kill you.
He's not gonna kill you.

14:38.111 --> 14:42.180
Look, look, I'm not gonna
let that happen, okay?

14:42.182 --> 14:43.414
Little brother,
I'm not gonna let

14:43.416 --> 14:44.449
that happen to you, okay?

14:44.451 --> 14:46.918
Okay.
All right?

14:46.920 --> 14:47.919
All right.
Okay.

14:47.921 --> 14:48.920
Excuse me.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.421
You can't be in here
right now.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.490
I know. This is only
gonna take a minute, though.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.559
It's very important,
okay?
Okay.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.394
Okay.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.930
Hey, Julianna.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.399
Hey, Trulianna.
How you doing?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.334
You're back?
Yeah.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.903
Wearing the cool pants
this time.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.371
Can you tell me
what happened?

15:06.373 --> 15:10.608
There was yelling. A-a fight.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.278
Okay, did you see
who was it was?
Derek.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.445
Is he okay?

15:14.447 --> 15:16.414
Who's Derek?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.382
Medeiros. He's a,
he's a night orderly.

15:18.385 --> 15:19.417
Is he okay?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.551
Tell me he's okay.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.653
You're gonna be okay.

15:21.655 --> 15:22.921
Please.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.622
Did you get that?

15:24.624 --> 15:26.157
Yeah, copy.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.159
Boss, Maternity's secure.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.360
Copy that.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.561
Derek Medeiros,

15:30.563 --> 15:33.064
he's has a record:
B and E, vandalism,

15:33.066 --> 15:34.999
all from a couple of years ago.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.567
Anything violent?
Not that he was

15:36.569 --> 15:38.102
arrested for, but it says here

15:38.104 --> 15:39.504
he was affiliated
with the Eastside Crew.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.306
If this guy's Eastside,
he probably did a lot worse

15:41.308 --> 15:43.107
than he got busted for.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.677
Gangbangers don't usually work
the night shift in a hospital.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.412
Sounds like he got out
of the life.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.447
If he did, he's
one of the few.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.182
Once you're in,
they make it real hard

15:51.184 --> 15:52.617
for you to get out in one piece.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.118
Yeah, I hear you, Lou,

15:54.120 --> 15:56.254
but we have to consider him
armed and dangerous

15:56.256 --> 15:57.405
until we know more.

15:57.406 --> 15:58.555
If this is some kind
of gang payback,

15:58.558 --> 16:00.358
we got more than one party
at play here.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.194
Got a picture here of Derek.
from the employee file.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.595
Sending it out.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.333
We'll be moving her
to surgery now.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.235
Okay.
Trudy, do you know if
this was a gang fight?

16:11.237 --> 16:12.503
He brought
his little brother

16:12.505 --> 16:17.342
Matt in. It was a gunshot.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.410
He wanted me to keep it quiet.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.112
But...

16:21.114 --> 16:25.583
he's been, he's been taking care
of Matt since his mom died.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.584
He's been,

16:26.586 --> 16:29.587
he's been turning
himself around.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.589
Is he in trouble?

16:31.591 --> 16:32.523
We're gonna do everything
we can.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.092
Please, please, Julianna.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.159
Keep him safe.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.227
All right.
(coughing)

16:36.229 --> 16:37.645
Sounds like maybe

16:37.646 --> 16:39.062
the little brother is
the gang connection.

16:39.065 --> 16:41.065
Peter, anything on him?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.433
No juvie file
on a Matt Medeiros.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.701
Looks like he's never been
picked up.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.702
Okay, team,

16:44.704 --> 16:45.770
let's assume multiple subjects.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.505
Peter, you focus
on the brothers.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.475
Let's find out if anyone
has a beef against them.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.576
Okay, hold on a sec. Boss,

16:51.578 --> 16:53.545
there's a call asking
about Trudy.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.513
Nurse at the front desk says
it sounds like Derek's voice.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.148
Okay.
Line two.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.550
Ready?
Yeah.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.552
Is this Derek?

17:01.554 --> 17:05.089
Yeah.
Hey, Derek, my name is Sergeant
Greg Parker. I'm with the Police

17:05.091 --> 17:06.524
Strategic Response Unit.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.259
You wanted to know about Trudy?

17:08.261 --> 17:10.395
Yeah. Uh, how is she?

17:10.397 --> 17:14.032
She's doing okay.
They're taking good care of her.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.600
Did you see who shot her?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.537
Okay, can you tell me this.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.173
Was it the same person
who shot your brother?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.541
eah.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.410
Okay,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.445
how many guys
we talking about, Derek?

17:27.447 --> 17:28.546
Three.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.548
And is Matt still with you?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.116
Yeah, he is.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.552
Who is that, the cops?

17:34.554 --> 17:38.656
And you guys are still
inside the hospital?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.124
Yeah, we are.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.526
We can't go to the cops.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.294
Great, Derek, okay.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.197
I know you're trying
to protect your brother,

17:46.199 --> 17:47.432
but if someone's after him,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.067
you'll both be safer
with us, buddy.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.635
You just think about this:

17:50.637 --> 17:53.471
your brother's injured,
he needs treatment.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.539
You tell me where you are,

17:54.541 --> 17:55.573
we'll get him out of there
safely,

17:55.575 --> 17:56.574
give him the help he needs.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.210
You can come to us?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.612
You, you promised.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.748
You bet, buddy, right away.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.849
North wing,

18:04.851 --> 18:07.685
fourth floor supply room.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.856
That's it, I'm dead.
I'm dead. I'm dead!

18:11.858 --> 18:13.825
Mattie, what are you doing?!

18:13.827 --> 18:17.228
Okay, guys, north wing,
fourth floor supply room.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.396
Let's bring him in.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.798
Copy. Alpha team
on the move. Bravo?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.733
Closing in.

18:24.871 --> 18:28.172
Matt! Hey, where do
you think you're going?

18:28.174 --> 18:29.640
I'm not going
to the cops!

18:29.642 --> 18:31.776
Listen, I got to
get you to a doctor

18:31.778 --> 18:33.344
and get you safe.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.612
Come on.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.585
Run. Run!

18:42.655 --> 18:44.255
Don't stop! Don't stop!

18:52.565 --> 18:55.700
Run! Keep running!

19:01.341 --> 19:04.609
Gunshots reported in Geriatrics,
third floor.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.577
PARKER:
Jules?

19:06.579 --> 19:08.880
Bravo moving.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.715
(cocks gun)
On my way.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.255
(gunshot)

19:17.257 --> 19:19.290
(gunshot)
Hey!

19:19.292 --> 19:21.425
Shane, this is crazy!

19:21.427 --> 19:22.793
Medeiros, man, you shouldn't
have got yourself involved.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.328
This had nothing to do with you!

19:24.330 --> 19:26.631
Listen, listen,
you don't have to do this!

19:26.633 --> 19:28.950
You think I want this?!

19:28.951 --> 19:31.268
It ain't nothing personal, man,
it's just... it's him or me!

19:31.271 --> 19:33.437
And it ain't gonna be me, man,
that's all!

19:33.439 --> 19:36.274
Come on, Shane, listen,
nobody has to die, man, okay?!

19:36.276 --> 19:39.443
Let's just chill!
Let's talk about this!

19:39.445 --> 19:42.313
All right, let's talk.
Go ahead. I'm listening.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.451
No joy.

19:47.453 --> 19:50.755
My brother, he didn't see
anything, okay?

19:50.757 --> 19:51.956
He wasn't there.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.758
You've got my word.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.560
Man, I want to believe you.

19:55.562 --> 19:56.961
but when his boys start asking,

19:56.963 --> 19:58.663
how I know Mattie
won't crack

19:58.665 --> 19:59.730
under the pressure?

19:59.732 --> 20:01.499
When whose boys start asking,
huh?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.834
T-T.J.'s.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.405
T.J.? You saw Shane pop T.J.
from the Dragons?

20:07.407 --> 20:08.839
Oh, Mattie!

20:11.778 --> 20:14.278
Talk and he knows
he's a dead man!

20:18.885 --> 20:20.518
Second floor!
Let's go.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.831
Eddie, what the hell was that?

20:33.833 --> 20:34.966
Police! Freeze!

20:34.968 --> 20:36.534
Come on, man, let's go!

20:36.536 --> 20:38.436
Put the gun down!
Stay where you are!

20:38.438 --> 20:40.438
Put the gun down!
(gasps)

20:40.440 --> 20:41.639
Come on, man,
let's go!

20:42.709 --> 20:43.908
Sam, get the fire.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.910
Wordy, Lewis, take the door.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.852
Right there,
let's see some hands!

20:54.854 --> 20:56.687
Let's see some hands.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.824
I got Matt.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.292
What about Derek?

21:04.497 --> 21:06.831
Negative.
He's still out there.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.447
SPIKE:<i> 6:31 PM, fire</i>
<i> from explosion contained.</i>

21:23.449 --> 21:25.483
Four armed subjects
still at large.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.851
One subject in custody.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.655
Subject's headed to Ward Six.

21:30.657 --> 21:31.922
On my way.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.758
Freeze! Police!

21:33.760 --> 21:35.526
Get your hands up!

21:35.528 --> 21:36.527
Get your hands up!

21:36.529 --> 21:38.462
Get down!

21:39.599 --> 21:41.065
Hands against the wall!

21:41.067 --> 21:42.500
Hands on the wall!

21:42.502 --> 21:45.336
Lou.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.804
I got it. I got it.

21:48.675 --> 21:49.840
(groaning)

21:49.842 --> 21:52.443
Subject contained.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.546
Gun's out. Your pants
sliding a little bit?

21:55.548 --> 21:56.681
Let me get that for you.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.416
(groaning)

21:59.952 --> 22:01.585
Yeah, don't mention it.
Come on.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.489
ED:
Lou, Wordy,

22:05.491 --> 22:07.491
good job.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.462
Sam, Jules, two subjects
west corridor. Wordy, east.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.564
On it.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.532
Get him down to the boss.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.900
Copy that.
Wordy, I'll catch up.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.101
Copy, Lou.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.869
Boss, we're bringing down
two subjects.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.505
Eddie, stay with the kid. See if
you can get anything out of him.

22:21.507 --> 22:22.940
I'm on it.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.343
It's Mattie, right?

22:25.345 --> 22:28.112
I'm Ed. Let's get you
somewhere safe.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.954
(panting)

22:47.533 --> 22:48.866
(grunting)

23:02.648 --> 23:03.981
Getting any deja vu?

23:03.983 --> 23:05.583
Yeah. Mostly the smell.

23:05.585 --> 23:09.453
Spring Blossom meets
industrial disinfectant.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.489
You in that hospital gown
and bunny slippers.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.057
Panda slippers.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.825
Couple hundred times
around these floors,

23:14.827 --> 23:16.394
you leaning on my arm.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.829
Yeah. You did always like me
best when I needed you, huh?

23:18.831 --> 23:20.498
Come on. Everyone
needs to be needed.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.534
Gives you something
to shoot for.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.669
SAM:
Ward Five clear.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.671
Copy.

23:27.673 --> 23:30.408
Very impressive, Matt.
It's very impressive.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.511
How many guys after you?
Three? You're what, 14?

23:33.513 --> 23:37.581
You want to tell me
why they want to shoot you?

23:37.583 --> 23:39.617
I spent a lot of time
on the street, Matt.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.619
They want to keep you quiet.

23:45.458 --> 23:48.058
I get why you don't want
to talk to me. I get that.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.761
It's just, I'm worried
about your brother.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.698
Name's Theo Watts.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.934
Street name Tug.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.169
Works as muscle for a meth
dealer named Shane Thomas.

23:59.172 --> 24:00.971
What crew they run with?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.507
Oh, they're independent.
They're trying to make a name.

24:03.509 --> 24:06.744
That's not good.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.446
Okay, Spike.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.481
Keep talking to the
Guns and Gangs guy.

24:10.483 --> 24:11.916
Get Peter on it, too.

24:11.918 --> 24:15.586
Any red flags they might
pull for today, today.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.121
Copy.
Okay.

24:19.659 --> 24:20.858
Mr. Watts.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.194
How you doing? Okay?

24:23.196 --> 24:25.596
My officer said... Before
he arrested you, he said

24:25.598 --> 24:29.233
that you reached behind you,
the back of your pants.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.968
Now, I can interpret
that two ways.

24:30.969 --> 24:32.702
One, you were hitching-- you
were hitching your pants up.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.272
Or you were drawing

24:34.273 --> 24:35.840
the concealed weapon
you had back there.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.976
Now, wearing big baggy pants,
that's not a serious offense,

24:38.978 --> 24:43.147
but drawing a gun on one of
my officers, that really is.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.682
I wasn't going
to draw on anybody.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.617
Tell me why you shot
a kid earlier today.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.019
Man, I didn't shoot no one.
No? 'Cause somebody did.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.021
And now here you are,
running around with a gun,

24:51.023 --> 24:52.857
shooting at that same kid.

24:52.859 --> 24:55.860
You trying to finish the job?

24:55.862 --> 24:58.662
Shane shoot him?

24:58.664 --> 24:59.763
I don't know. Go ask him.

24:59.765 --> 25:01.866
No, son, I'm asking you.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.905
REMO:
<i> Robocops, man!</i>

25:07.907 --> 25:10.641
Yo, what is that, AKs
they're carrying out there?!

25:10.643 --> 25:12.693
Calm the hell down.

25:12.694 --> 25:14.744
No, man! They can shoot through
walls with that stuff, man!

25:14.747 --> 25:16.780
Yo, yo, I'm out of here, man.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.149
Come on, Remo, you know
I can't let you do that, man!

25:23.789 --> 25:25.306
Look, I already shot
three people today,

25:25.307 --> 25:26.824
so I'm kind of running out of
things to lose. You feel me?

25:26.826 --> 25:30.561
So I need you to stop
and think about what it is

25:30.563 --> 25:33.030
you're really trying to say
to me right now, bro.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.767
You know I got your back, man.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.836
Always.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.241
What about T, man?

25:44.243 --> 25:45.743
What about him?

25:45.745 --> 25:48.112
He still hasn't called, man.
What if he got busted?

25:48.114 --> 25:50.648
Then he better know how
to keep his damn mouth shut.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.717
All right. We need to split up.
Might find them faster.

25:53.719 --> 25:55.819
No, man.
You see them,
you holler at me.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.588
Yo, Shane,
you got my piece, man.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.143
MATT:
<i> It's nothing to do with him.</i>

26:19.145 --> 26:21.011
<i> Derek didn't do anything.</i>

26:21.013 --> 26:24.181
ED:<i> So, it's just</i>
<i> the two of you guys, right?</i>

26:24.183 --> 26:25.349
MATT:
<i> Yeah.</i>

26:25.351 --> 26:29.286
Since our moms got killed.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.790
I'm sorry to hear that, Matt.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.263
But you guys are doing okay,
right?

26:39.265 --> 26:41.231
I mean,
your brother's got a job.

26:41.233 --> 26:42.733
and he is trying
to look out for you,

26:42.735 --> 26:44.768
but right now,

26:44.770 --> 26:46.670
he's in danger
of getting shot.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.839
Matt, of getting shot.

26:48.841 --> 26:51.075
Okay?

26:51.077 --> 26:53.711
And if you can just tell me
what happened, I can help.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.945
It doesn't matter.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.083
Me and my brother are dead.

26:59.085 --> 27:03.053
If it's not today,
it's tomorrow.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.322
That's the way it is.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.826
You cops can't do
nothing about it.

27:14.767 --> 27:15.866
Let's go.

27:18.304 --> 27:19.737
Boss, got something
from the Guns and Gangs unit.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.904
Could be relevant.

27:20.906 --> 27:22.006
Yeah. Go ahead, Peter.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.192
42 Division found a body

27:24.193 --> 27:26.377
about an hour ago
IDed as one John Chen.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.879
AKA TJ Chen,
Riverside Dragons.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.881
Oh, Yeah? I'm guessing
it wasn't natural causes.

27:30.883 --> 27:33.083
That's right.
Single gunshot to the head.

27:33.085 --> 27:36.086
Body was in an alley
off Queen and Pape.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.855
Okay. Copy that, Eddie?

27:37.857 --> 27:40.891
Officer. I need you to stay
here with this young man.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.793
I need you to get a doctor
to look at him immediately.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.062
Mattie, I'm going to be
back to get you, all right?

27:49.735 --> 27:51.001
TJ Chen's
head of the Dragons.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.871
They run the meth trade,
Broadview to Woodbine.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.172
So, if Shane and his crew
were trying to do business

27:55.174 --> 27:56.907
down there, they'd
have some friction.

27:56.909 --> 27:59.910
Yeah, but taking out TJ's
asking for serious payback.

27:59.912 --> 28:00.978
The Dragons
find out it's Shane,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.179
he won't live
to see the weekend.

28:02.181 --> 28:04.882
Unless there weren't
any witnesses.

28:04.884 --> 28:07.284
Or the witnesses
disappeared.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.820
And we're sure
this relates to TJ?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.188
I don't know.
Let's find out.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.756
Okay.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.994
Mr. Watts.
A couple more questions.
Whatever, man.

28:16.996 --> 28:19.697
I ain't talking.
Right. I get it. Okay.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.098
I thought you might know
something about a body

28:21.100 --> 28:23.734
they found today--
TJ Chen.

28:23.736 --> 28:24.968
I don't know nothing about that.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.270
So, I can't speak on it.

28:26.272 --> 28:30.274
Okay, so you don't mind
if we double-check that?

28:30.276 --> 28:32.376
Spike, let's get a picture
of Mr. Watts here

28:32.378 --> 28:34.344
down to Guns and Gangs.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.280
Have them pass it around,
see if anybody recognizes him

28:36.282 --> 28:37.448
from the neighborhood.

28:37.450 --> 28:38.982
Copy that.
Should probably run it

28:38.984 --> 28:40.818
by the Dragons, too,
just to make sure.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.553
Copy.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.287
Hey, hold up.
Man, I wasn't there. I swear.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.889
I found out after
it all went down.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.492
Okay. It was Shane.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.161
And the kid
saw him do it.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.766
Get him out of here.

28:55.768 --> 28:57.334
Look, it was that kid's
own fault, man.

28:57.335 --> 28:58.901
He wasn't supposed to be there
in the first place.

29:01.006 --> 29:02.172
Let's go talk to the kid, Ed.

29:16.489 --> 29:20.324
Sarge, somebody raided a supply
closet, lost a lot of blood.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.492
It's got to be our subject.

29:21.494 --> 29:22.926
PARKER:
Hey, guys.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.428
We found Derek's locker.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.897
Uh, looks like he was taking
his medical career seriously.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.365
He's making plans.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.967
Got a life ahead of him.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.435
At least, this morning, he did.

29:36.509 --> 29:38.208
Can I have just a second?
Thank you.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.409
Hey, Matt.

29:39.411 --> 29:43.313
I'm Sergeant Parker.
You remember Ed Lane.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.950
Matt, does your brother know
that you saw Shane shoot TJ?

29:46.952 --> 29:49.453
It's all right.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.438
Matt, it's important.

29:51.439 --> 29:53.422
And does your brother know
that you saw TJ get shot?

29:54.894 --> 29:56.493
Yeah.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.196
Okay. Okay, good man.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.064
We're going to leave

30:01.066 --> 30:03.033
this officer here
to look out for you.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.902
No, you got to let me...
Got to find my brother.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.204
Listen to me. Matt, we're
going to find him, all right?

30:07.206 --> 30:10.007
We're going to make sure
he gets safe. That's our job.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.074
Sergeant Parker.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.309
Hey, doctor.
You got time

30:12.311 --> 30:13.477
to take care of
our friend here?

30:13.479 --> 30:15.078
Absolutely.
Thank you.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.980
I need the cuffs off
to treat him.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.583
Hey, Matt, how you feeling?

30:19.585 --> 30:20.984
(gasping)

30:20.986 --> 30:23.320
So, Matt saw too much.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.490
Now he's the only thing
linking Shane to a murder.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.592
He's got to get to him before
it gets back to the Dragons.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.994
So Derek's going after Shane
to save his brother?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.596
Yeah, his only family.
Wouldn't you?

30:32.598 --> 30:35.599
(line ringing)

30:35.601 --> 30:37.868
(phone ringing)

30:41.373 --> 30:42.539
PARKER:
Derek?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.074
Greg Parker again.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.175
Where's my brother?

30:45.177 --> 30:46.343
He's safe.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.212
Doctor's taking care of him.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.947
And I want
to keep you safe, too.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.849
We can protect you from Shane.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.550
Even if you find him, he'll be
back on the street tomorrow.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.918
No. We're not going to

30:54.920 --> 30:55.986
let that happen.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.656
Listen, the system is broken.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.325
Only one way I can make sure
my brother is safe.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.527
Do this, you'll throw away
everything you've done.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.495
I'm sorry. I got to do this.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.498
(phone beeps off)

31:12.137 --> 31:13.971
He's left the life.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.439
But he still won't trust cops.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.875
Matt said their mom got killed.
It's personal.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.478
Spike, let's find out
what happened to their mom.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.614
Copy.
We step this up, guys.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.515
Okay? Derek's a good kid.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.251
He's worked hard
to get where he's at.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.319
<i> We got to stop him</i>
<i> before he crosses a line</i>

31:29.321 --> 31:30.654
<i> we can't pull him back from.</i>

31:37.529 --> 31:39.463
It's over.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.473
ED:<i> If we can't keep the</i>
<i> hospital contained, Doctor,</i>

31:49.475 --> 31:51.975
we lose the integrity
of the sweep.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.378
All I'm saying is
other ERs are at capacity.

31:54.380 --> 31:56.413
They're overwhelmed
out there in triage.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.649
We need the building back
as soon as possible

31:58.651 --> 32:00.017
or people are going to die.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.518
Okay, Doctor.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.821
SPIKE:
Guys, I got info
on the boys' mom.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.123
Serena Medeiros. Fatally wounded
in a shooting three years ago.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.557
Place called Pete's Top Slice.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.992
Pete's?

32:08.994 --> 32:11.094
No wonder he doesn't trust us.
What happened?

32:11.096 --> 32:13.230
One night, a gangbanger named
Johns walked into Pete's

32:13.232 --> 32:14.698
looking for a guy
who snitched on him.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.466
He sprayed the whole place.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.568
Six dead including
a little girl.

32:18.570 --> 32:19.670
And Serena Medeiros.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.405
He shouldn't even
been on the street.

32:21.407 --> 32:23.607
After the guy snitched on him,
cops busted him.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.677
Didn't stick. 24 hours later,
he's back on the street.

32:26.679 --> 32:29.546
North wing's contained.
Keep it locked down.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.981
Yes, sir.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.660
Police!

32:43.662 --> 32:45.295
BOTH:
Don't move!

32:45.297 --> 32:47.431
Stay where you are!
Have you been shot?

32:47.433 --> 32:49.533
No.

32:49.535 --> 32:50.667
Derek do this to you?

32:53.439 --> 32:54.705
Where'd he go?

32:54.707 --> 32:56.106
How do I know?!

32:56.108 --> 32:58.108
So he just tied you up
and left you here?

32:58.110 --> 33:00.077
Punk ass. Could've capped me.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.378
Just took my phone.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.479
Boss, we've contained
another subject.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.381
His name is Remo Benzina.

33:04.383 --> 33:06.016
Derek's still on the run.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.184
He's got Remo's phone.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.622
(phone rings)

33:20.532 --> 33:22.332
What's up?

33:22.334 --> 33:24.001
Remo's text message.
Check it out.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.535
The message was sent
at 6:42 P.M.,

33:25.537 --> 33:28.572
and Jules and Sam found him
at 6:39 P.M.

33:28.574 --> 33:34.411
He'd already had
his phone taken
by Derek.
Yeah, yeah.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.079
West basement?

33:36.081 --> 33:37.414
Boiler room,
west stairs.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.683
(phone rings)

33:43.188 --> 33:44.621
(ringing continues)

33:49.561 --> 33:51.728
I told you what I had to do.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.197
Derek, we know where you are
and we're coming there now.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.465
No, no, no, stay, stay away.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.666
Bravo, Alpha team,
boiler room.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.068
West-most stairs.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.736
Derek, I know
what happened
to your mom.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.805
Then you know
why I don't trust cops.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.440
I'm not talking
to you as a cop.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.575
I'm not talking to you as a man
who wants you to succeed.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.178
And you made a choice
to be somebody different.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.280
Don't quit.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.582
Don't quit on that choice.

34:12.584 --> 34:16.053
Don't quit on the guy
that you set out to be,

34:16.055 --> 34:17.754
who Matt needs you to be,

34:17.756 --> 34:21.258
and who your mom would have
been so proud of.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.628
You gotta trust yourself, Derek.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.696
You don't want to do this.

34:26.698 --> 34:31.168
No, I don't, but I have to.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.121
(softly):
Remo.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.324
(sighs)

34:59.731 --> 35:02.132
You ought to know better.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.402
Get down! Get down!

35:08.273 --> 35:11.441
Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down on the ground!

35:11.443 --> 35:13.376
PARKER:
Sam, Jules, keep him contained!

35:21.854 --> 35:25.355
Eddie, take that catwalk.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.665
Who's got a 20?

35:38.504 --> 35:39.836
No joy.

35:48.714 --> 35:53.250
Police! Don't move! Don't move!
Police! Freeze!

35:53.252 --> 35:55.152
Stay down!

35:55.154 --> 35:56.920
Let's see some hands!

35:56.922 --> 35:58.488
Hands behind your back!
Stay down!

35:58.490 --> 36:00.857
Let's see some hands!
Let's see some hands!

36:03.428 --> 36:05.862
Okay. Nice work.

36:05.864 --> 36:09.299
Sam, let's get some medical
personnel down here right away.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.801
Hey, Derek.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.638
Mattie, where's Mattie?
I need to talk to him.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.339
He's doing okay.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.175
(over radio):
Multiple shots fired,
west boiler room.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.809
SRU on scene.

36:19.811 --> 36:22.646
I need help stat!

36:22.648 --> 36:24.314
(groaning)

36:24.316 --> 36:26.650
Officer, I need a hand.
Come over here.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.385
I gotta get an IV in.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.520
Here, hold him.
Pressure. Don't let go.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.962
You did the right thing.
You took care of your brother

36:38.964 --> 36:40.630
the best way
you could.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.732
I just need  to talk to him,
let him know I'm all right.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.684
You will. You just stay put.

36:44.685 --> 36:46.635
We're gonna have you taken
care of first.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.837
Hey, Eddie, let's keep

36:47.839 --> 36:49.439
our friend here
inside a cruiser.

36:49.441 --> 36:50.707
I'm gonna stay here
with Derek.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.842
Copy that.
Punk ass.

36:52.844 --> 36:54.477
Good man.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.565
Whoa, Matt.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.634
What are you doing
with that gun?

37:50.636 --> 37:52.402
You shot my brother.

37:52.404 --> 37:53.603
Matt,

37:53.605 --> 37:55.372
your brother's gonna be okay.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.407
No, I heard about the gunshot.
You're lying.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.475
No, he's getting fixed up.

37:58.477 --> 38:00.410
I wouldn't lie
to you about that.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.646
No, I gotta finish this now.

38:02.648 --> 38:05.382
Matt, this isn't the way
to do it.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.950
Yeah, well, you guys
ain't gonna do it.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.652
He's going to jail.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.304
Yeah,

38:10.305 --> 38:11.955
yeah, like the guy killed my mom
went to jail?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.523
I hear you, Matt.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.791
You don't.
You don't

38:14.793 --> 38:16.626
know nothin' about that.

38:16.628 --> 38:20.664
You're right,

38:20.666 --> 38:23.533
I don't.

38:23.535 --> 38:27.804
But I do know how it feels
when I see these guys

38:27.806 --> 38:30.373
out on the street
who have no right to be
and it makes me mad.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.475
It makes me feel
like thing's not safe.

38:32.477 --> 38:36.446
Okay, then! So then you know
why I gotta do it!

38:36.448 --> 38:38.348
I do. I do,

38:38.350 --> 38:41.584
but Matt, listen,
five minutes ago,

38:41.586 --> 38:43.687
your brother Derek had
the same choice

38:43.689 --> 38:45.855
to make, Matt,
and he put the gun down.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.557
He put it down.

38:47.559 --> 38:50.393
And I know that he would want
you to make the same choice.

38:50.395 --> 38:51.661
You guys made
it this far

38:51.663 --> 38:52.696
because you stuck
together, Matt.

38:52.698 --> 38:54.664
You stuck together.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.965
You looked out
for each other.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.034
Now, Derek's been there
for you, Matt.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.603
He's been there for you.

39:00.605 --> 39:02.572
Now you gotta be there for him.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.508
(sobbing)
Matt,

39:05.510 --> 39:09.346
it's okay, Matt.
It's okay.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.815
It's okay.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.718
It's okay.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.021
(sobbing)

39:18.023 --> 39:20.457
We're gonna get
through this, Matt.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.827
I'm not gonna
let you down.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.597
I'm not gonna punch out
at the end of this shift.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.999
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

39:30.001 --> 39:32.535
You have nothing to be
sorry about.

39:41.513 --> 39:47.984
¶ How many more days
can you hold out? ¶

39:54.126 --> 40:02.632
¶ "How much longer
can you wait?" she asked ¶

40:04.136 --> 40:15.578
¶ There was a time I thought I,
I could answer ¶

40:15.580 --> 40:20.550
¶ But my tongue gets tied ¶

40:20.552 --> 40:25.722
¶ As my thoughts drift away ¶

40:28.427 --> 40:36.866
¶ Glory, glory, hallelujah ¶

40:36.868 --> 40:38.668
(group conversing)

40:38.670 --> 40:41.104
¶ The sun is shining... ¶

40:41.106 --> 40:43.506
Okay, no way, no way.

40:43.508 --> 40:44.974
I'm tired.
I'm going home.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.943
I'm not doing the Greg
Parker Review from hell.

40:46.945 --> 40:47.977
Simple as that.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.079
What the...?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.648
What about the review?

40:51.650 --> 40:55.569
PARKER:
You guys want a review?

40:55.570 --> 40:59.489
How's this? Officers Callaghan,
Braddock performed admirably

40:59.491 --> 41:02.192
in securing assigned areas
and gathering key intel

41:02.194 --> 41:06.830
without any public displays
of affection.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.132
Officer Scarlatti's
skill in computers

41:09.134 --> 41:10.667
and other geeky toys
was augmented today

41:10.669 --> 41:12.001
by a truly spectacular
takedown...

41:12.003 --> 41:13.703
ALL:
Yeah!

41:13.705 --> 41:16.105
...of a dangerous subject.

41:16.107 --> 41:20.477
Officer Young provided crucial
backup and insight

41:20.479 --> 41:23.213
into the psychology
of yet another subject.

41:23.215 --> 41:27.183
And Officer Wordsworth, well,

41:27.185 --> 41:31.054
he's just plain and simple
the toughest SOB

41:31.056 --> 41:33.089
I have ever had the privilege
to command.

41:33.091 --> 41:36.293
Thank you.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.496
And that leaves us
with Officer Ed Lane, who,

41:39.498 --> 41:43.566
truth be told, has always been a
bit of a problem for Team One...

41:43.568 --> 41:45.602
Let's have it.

41:45.604 --> 41:48.805
...'cause when everybody's
struggling,

41:48.807 --> 41:50.106
he's pushing through.

41:50.108 --> 41:52.075
When everyone's lost,
he finds our way.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.644
And when we falter,
he picks us up.

41:54.646 --> 41:59.115
The problem is
is after he's done all that,

41:59.117 --> 42:03.553
who picks him up, right?

42:05.924 --> 42:08.625
You saved that kid today, Eddie.

42:08.627 --> 42:11.194
At one time or another,
you've saved

42:11.196 --> 42:13.630
every person
in this room.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.532
Yep.

42:15.534 --> 42:21.738
So, today is Ed Lane's fifth
anniversary as Team Leader.

42:21.740 --> 42:22.772
All right!

42:22.774 --> 42:23.907
(officers slapping table)

42:23.909 --> 42:25.041
Cheers to that.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.075
ALL:
Cheers.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.044
Five more years.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.780
Yeah, finally shut him up.
