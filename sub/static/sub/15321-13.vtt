WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.625
No!

00:14.182 --> 00:16.639
- Get her, get her, get her, get her,
- No!

00:17.435 --> 00:18.299
Oh!

00:18.311 --> 00:22.224
Tommy, Denny, come on.
Stop playing with your sister.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.222
Go finish packing.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.558
I'm serious.
Your dad wants to hit the road.

00:26.569 --> 00:29.356
- Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
yo, come on. - This isn't over.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.899
The tickle monster's
keeping an eye on you guys.

00:30.907 --> 00:32.738
You have to come camping
with us.

00:32.742 --> 00:34.403
- No, guys.
- Yes, you do. Yeah.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.492
- Come on, please. Please.
- Come on. It'd be so fun.

00:36.496 --> 00:38.828
We're gonna make s'mores.
We could go biking.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.662
Next time.
Next time, okay?

00:40.666 --> 00:42.577
I promise.
Next time.

00:42.585 --> 00:45.497
Go. Go. Go pack up
like mom said. Go.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.046
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.760
Rosie, honey, I left
the number for the campground

00:54.764 --> 00:55.924
here on the refrigerator.

00:55.932 --> 00:57.422
We don't get
any reception up there,

00:57.433 --> 00:59.094
so if there's
an emergency at all,

00:59.101 --> 01:00.762
you just call that number,
okay?

01:00.770 --> 01:02.476
And I want you to promise me

01:02.480 --> 01:04.141
to go straight
to Sterling's house

01:04.148 --> 01:06.855
after the dance,
and I mean straight.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.440
But...

01:10.905 --> 01:12.236
Rosie, are you listening to me?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.481
Yeah, mom, whatever.
I'm not an idiot.

01:15.493 --> 01:17.950
I didn't say that you were.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.682
Well, I appreciate the apology,

01:45.690 --> 01:49.353
but that's not getting the
palettes here five hours ago.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.352
Yeah. Yeah.
Fine, yeah!

01:52.363 --> 01:54.319
I'll talk to him.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.534
Yeah, hey. Stan Larsen.
Who am | speaking to?

01:59.537 --> 02:01.653
Well, look,
like I told your associate,

02:01.664 --> 02:03.154
I still haven't gotten
my order.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.621
You're the third person

02:04.625 --> 02:06.456
that I've had
to explain this to now.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.917
Yes, order number 52932.

02:08.921 --> 02:12.254
Hello?
Yes, I'm still here.

02:12.258 --> 02:16.843
Look, I need somebody...
I need a juggernaut.

02:16.846 --> 02:19.929
52932.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.179
We're almost there, folks!
Three more districts!

03:28.793 --> 03:30.909
What are you doing here?
This is a private party.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.706
The election results
are about to come in...

03:32.713 --> 03:34.089
Where's Jamie Wright?

03:34.090 --> 03:35.000
I don't know.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.338
I saw him at the office
before I got here.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.673
What vehicle was he driving?

03:37.677 --> 03:40.134
A campaign car.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.596
- What is going on?
- We need APB on a black crown Vic.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.511
- It's a Richmond campaign car.
- Do you have any idea where he could be?

03:46.519 --> 03:48.555
It could be any of the plates
we got on our list.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.053
He was supposed to be here half
an hour ago. So was Darren.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.272
- They aren't answering their cells.
- Jamie Wright. Caucasian male in his 303.

03:53.275 --> 03:54.890
Richmond's not here.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.688
What is going on?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.319
What are you doing here?

03:59.323 --> 04:01.655
l was just chewin'
your boss's ear,

04:01.659 --> 04:03.650
telling him how my grandson's

04:03.661 --> 04:06.494
always had
a rich sort of imagination.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.658
We got to get to the rally.
Everybody's waiting.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.576
Let him finish.

04:09.583 --> 04:13.292
That's right.
We're not done here.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.831
He doesn't owe you anything.

04:14.839 --> 04:18.673
Your boss has been tellin'
stories about me on the TV.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.964
Lost my leg, all kinds of lies.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.882
Wonder where he got 'em.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.881
- What the hell is wrong with you?!
- That's enough. I'm done with this.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.267
You owe me.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.391
You think I didn't figure out

04:32.398 --> 04:34.059
where you really
were that night.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.476
Shut up.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.645
The night that girl
got herself killed!

04:37.653 --> 04:39.689
Shut up.

04:40.489 --> 04:42.821
Don't walk out on me,
Jamie boy.

04:42.825 --> 04:44.690
Jamie, stop.
Jerry's waiting for me.

04:44.702 --> 04:46.283
I got a car.
I'll take you.

04:48.706 --> 04:51.413
It doesn't make any sense.
The campaign is Jamie's life.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.203
Darren's all that matters
to him. He'd never hurt him.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.871
Yeah, it's one
of Richmond's campaign cars.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.165
Jerry, is he with you?

04:59.884 --> 05:01.374
Okay.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.216
That was Darren's driver.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.006
He left his phone in the car.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.345
He dropped him off
at some house,

05:06.348 --> 05:07.508
- but now he's not there.
- What's the address?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.347
Somewhere in Pigeon Point,
under a bridge.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.683
That's Jamie's house.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.396
23 Normandy Avenue.
Get a car out there right away.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.650
Units are en route.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.036
Jamie, what are we doing here?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.780
I want to show you something.

05:32.792 --> 05:34.874
They're waiting for us
at the rally.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.839
This used to be
a small logging town.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.007
Just a no-name
lumberyard.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.347
Then the fire came, burned
everything to the ground.

05:50.351 --> 05:56.563
And from those ashes all this was built,
and this place became a city,

05:57.191 --> 06:01.104
and this city...
it's yours now, Darren.

06:01.821 --> 06:03.982
We won.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.190
We did it.
We did it.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.693
I got a text from my guy
at the polls 10 minutes ago.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.696
Adams is gonna concede
within the hour.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.413
We did it.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.958
It's, uh...
yeah, it's nothing.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.377
Why did you lie?

06:24.385 --> 06:28.048
Because you...
you were gonna give up, Darren.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.386
You needed something
to believe in.

06:29.390 --> 06:31.051
Why did you lie to the police?

06:31.058 --> 06:33.049
You told them you were with your
grandfather the night that...

06:33.060 --> 06:36.393
My grandfather
is a drunk!

06:36.397 --> 06:40.561
He's a drunk and a liar!
And whatever he said is bullshit!

06:40.568 --> 06:42.934
Where were you the night
the Larsen girl died, Jamie?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.445
This... this election...
this is a...

06:50.452 --> 06:52.613
this is a stepping stone.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.408
But first you had to win.
Don't you see, Darren?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.948
I had the perfect plan.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.621
With the Indian bones
at the waterfront,

06:59.628 --> 07:01.129
Adams was dead in the water.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.586
You planted those bones?!

07:02.590 --> 07:03.830
- Are you crazy?
- Oh, come on!

07:03.841 --> 07:06.924
Get off your soapbox.
It was for your own good.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.509
The Indians wanted to expand
off the island.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.378
Ames was looking for a way out.

07:11.390 --> 07:13.381
I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.553
Promising what in exchange?

07:15.561 --> 07:17.552
As mayor, you would approve
a casino on the waterfront.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.053
What you did with those people
was fraud.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.895
It's against everything
you believe in, I know!

07:20.900 --> 07:23.733
But, Jesus, Darren,
you wanted to win.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.067
And you never learned
to make friends

07:25.070 --> 07:26.776
with the people
that matter most.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.237
But that's okay.
That's why you have me.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.072
Because when you approve
this casino,

07:31.076 --> 07:33.658
our coffers will be full
for the next run.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.163
And the one after that...

07:35.164 --> 07:36.654
- What happened to the girl?
- and the next time.

07:36.665 --> 07:37.745
What happened to the girl?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.991
- This is nothing, Darren.
- The girl, Jamie!

07:40.002 --> 07:41.162
- This is the beginning.
- The girl!

07:41.170 --> 07:43.456
It was an accident!

07:49.970 --> 07:51.471
bullshit, big shot.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.758
Oh, what are you
trying to do, scare me?

07:53.766 --> 07:55.302
You said there wouldn't
be any screw-ups.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.470
I got the charges dropped.
Just calm down.

07:57.478 --> 08:00.641
Hey, it's a speed bump.
That's all.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.138
It's taken care of now.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.310
lt better be.
The bones are buried.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.649
I held up my end
of the bargain.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.814
And I guarantee you,
Richmond will go along with it.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.484
It's not a problem.
We're back on track.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.858
If that's it, let's go.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.110
I want off this damn island
already.

08:16.789 --> 08:19.371
We should go out separately,
like we always do.

09:02.126 --> 09:05.038
Who are you?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.957
What are you doing here?

09:07.965 --> 09:09.455
Answer me.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.708
Nothing.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.092
I didn't see anything.
I swear.

09:22.104 --> 09:23.469
Hey.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.229
What the hell is that?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.349
No, no, no. Stop.
Be quiet.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.861
Be quiet!

09:47.963 --> 09:51.296
She wouldn't stop screaming.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.086
She wouldn't listen.

09:55.888 --> 09:58.220
I didn't know what to do,
Darren.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.838
I tried to reason with her.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.341
I tried so hard
to make her understand,

10:02.352 --> 10:06.186
but... but I panicked.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.023
l panicked.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.358
She was gonna ruin everything.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.522
It was an accident.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.521
She was alive
when she went into that lake.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.443
Is that what you call
an accident?

10:34.259 --> 10:37.751
What are you doing with my gun?

10:37.763 --> 10:40.254
We got an ID
on a Richmond campaign vehicle.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.428
It's been located
at the parking lot of city hall.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.805
I thought she was dead.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.976
She wasn't.

10:55.030 --> 10:58.022
She got out of the car...

10:58.033 --> 10:59.819
ran into the woods.

11:01.453 --> 11:05.913
We had come so far...
too far.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.669
I couldn't let her get away.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.531
Shut up!

11:45.539 --> 11:49.282
Shut up!

12:08.604 --> 12:10.640
l was only thinking of you.

12:14.109 --> 12:18.648
Hey.
I didn't want to do it.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.647
But when l have to do
something, I do it.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.990
| always do it, Darren.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.235
Everything I've always
done is been for you.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.861
I'm leaving now, Jamie.

12:27.873 --> 12:30.706
Stop. Stop! Stop!

12:30.709 --> 12:31.994
You want to...
you want to be an idealist,

12:32.002 --> 12:33.867
go... go plant a tree.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.710
But if you want to be a leader,

12:35.714 --> 12:37.545
you have to be willing
to get blood on your hands.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.335
I can't keep doing it
for you, Darren!

12:39.343 --> 12:42.506
You killed a young girl,
you son of a bitch!

12:42.512 --> 12:44.924
You put me in this chair!

12:44.932 --> 12:47.093
Your weakness put you
in that wheelchair!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.431
God!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.426
You know the greatest thing
we did on this campaign?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.643
It was tricking the voters

12:51.647 --> 12:53.512
into believing you're
something you're not.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.856
You surround yourself
with people like Gwen and Lily

12:56.860 --> 12:59.977
because you want to believe
that you're a good man.

12:59.988 --> 13:00.943
You have no idea...

13:03.325 --> 13:05.907
You let your wife
drive that night alone

13:05.911 --> 13:09.119
so she could die
because you like the limelight!

13:09.122 --> 13:10.328
Stop pretending!

13:10.332 --> 13:14.245
That's the man you are, Darren!

13:20.592 --> 13:22.583
This is the beginning.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.461
This is it.
Olympia's next.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.556
And then the senate seat.
And then... and then D.C.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.351
This is it, Darren.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.138
You can go the whole way...

13:36.149 --> 13:39.562
As long as you realize
who you are.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.857
Oh, God, Jamie.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.195
Put the gun down, Jamie,

13:44.199 --> 13:45.939
before you do something
you don't want to do.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.907
- Drop the gun, Jamie.
- Just put the gun down, please.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.196
Jamie.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.614
Jamie, listen to them.

13:50.622 --> 13:53.455
I know you'll do
the right thing, Mr. Mayor.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.244
- We can help you.
- Jamie.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.833
- Mr. Wright, put down the gun.
- Drop the gun, Jamie!

13:56.837 --> 13:58.668
Mr. Wright,
put down the gun!

14:51.058 --> 14:54.141
The shooter's weapon...
it was empty.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.551
Jamie's employee
files, cellphone records,

16:11.555 --> 16:13.386
and some stuff the unis got
from his room

16:13.390 --> 16:14.721
at his grandpa's crib.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.884
Yeah, they found that.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.009
It's the missing film
from Rosie's camera.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.892
What's on it?

16:23.900 --> 16:26.482
Got to send it to the lab.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.359
Chief Jackson's
about to be charged

16:32.367 --> 16:34.198
for obstruction of justice.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.160
She's not gonna make a deal
to give up Ames.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.832
Son of a bitch is gonna walk.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.450
His attorney's en route.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.000
IA will be investigating.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.426
But I read
the witness statements.

16:53.430 --> 16:54.761
It was a good shooting, Holder.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.598
Hey.
Jamie's cellphone records.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.017
He made a call to Michael Ames

17:01.021 --> 17:03.012
3:37 am.
the night of the killing.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.604
It doesn't prove collusion.

17:04.608 --> 17:05.973
We got no way of knowing
what he said.

17:05.984 --> 17:09.021
He could have gone to the lake,
helped Jamie kill her.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.812
That night, the taxi
that dropped him off at home

17:11.823 --> 17:13.324
had a broken taillight.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.531
What if we go back
and check...

17:14.534 --> 17:16.866
We already checked
all cab company manifests.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.531
None of them stopped
at Discovery Park

17:18.538 --> 17:19.869
or the Ames address.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.033
What about the busted taillight?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.327
Half the cabs in the city
have broken lights.

17:23.335 --> 17:26.122
His lawyers will have
a field day with us.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.954
Sarah, it's over.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.219
D.A. Niilson and myself

17:33.220 --> 17:34.585
will be addressing
the media tonight.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.053
We have to talk
to the Larsen family first.

17:40.352 --> 17:44.470
I want you to know, both of you
did good work on this case.

18:03.041 --> 18:05.828
- Wow.
- Yeah.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.575
Holy crap.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.329
Which window's our bedroom?

18:11.341 --> 18:13.332
Hey, in this house,

18:13.343 --> 18:15.174
you each get your own bedroom.

18:15.178 --> 18:16.167
Really?

18:16.179 --> 18:18.636
Yeah. You know
what else I heard?

18:18.640 --> 18:21.632
I heard there's a swing set
in the backyard.

18:21.643 --> 18:22.883
Wow.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.226
- Hey, right through that
gate back there. - Come on.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.561
Wait for me!

18:26.565 --> 18:28.271
Hey.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.981
We're gonna have to move
in a couple of weeks

18:29.985 --> 18:31.441
if we're gonna do this.

18:31.444 --> 18:34.607
You sure?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.570
Yeah.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.952
This is the house

18:42.956 --> 18:45.572
she was gonna come back to
from college.

18:47.586 --> 18:49.702
Come on, let's go inside.

19:03.143 --> 19:06.306
What are you doing here?

19:06.313 --> 19:08.099
You should be resting.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.813
Cleaners are coming in an hour.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.478
They'll have the glass
and the carpet replaced

19:12.485 --> 19:13.520
by the afternoon.

19:13.528 --> 19:16.486
I'll handle that.
You need to go home.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.148
Darren, stop.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.820
You don't need to issue
a press release.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.863
The press will have
a field day with this

19:22.871 --> 19:24.361
unless we get out
in front of it.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.159
l-l don't want Jamie
defining my legacy

19:27.167 --> 19:28.247
before it gets started.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.546
You won this election
because of you.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.506
We don't need to spin anything.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.681
You've got some blood
on your face.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.951
This place is still
the same as it was

20:46.955 --> 20:49.287
my first year
as a city councilman.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.906
They had me all the way down
at the end.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.579
Didn't matter to me at all.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.544
l was a boy from Pigeon Point.

20:56.548 --> 20:58.834
I thought
I could change things.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.460
Learned the only thing
this place changes

21:03.471 --> 21:05.803
are the people in it.

21:05.807 --> 21:07.593
Things will change.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.390
I'm sorry about Jamie.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.687
It took me three tries
to become mayor.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.110
You learned how to do it
in one.

21:25.118 --> 21:27.985
You got the makings
of a great leader, Darren.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.922
Don't put away
your clothes and stuff

21:40.925 --> 21:42.631
'cause you're still gonna
need 'em for school.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.842
Tom! Take this
up to your mom.

21:44.846 --> 21:48.054
- Go.
- Why do I got to do it?

21:49.142 --> 21:51.508
She's doing the best
she can, buddy.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.510
Yeah.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.513
And, you... stop feeding
that dog potato chips.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.810
I'm gonna put you in one of these
boxes with him for a week.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.153
Hey, last one
upstairs is a rotten turd.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.613
Shut up. You are.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.702
You need help?

22:57.085 --> 22:59.292
I figured you... you weren't
gonna move all this crap

22:59.295 --> 23:01.627
by yourself, right?

23:01.631 --> 23:03.997
Thanks, Ter.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.546
She kept looking at me
that last time.

23:16.271 --> 23:20.935
You know, I was so busy
packing for that camping trip...

23:20.942 --> 23:23.228
that I didn't look at her.
I...

23:27.031 --> 23:31.991
I didn't see her, Ter.
I didn't see her.

23:34.873 --> 23:37.831
Yeah, you did, Mitch.

23:37.834 --> 23:41.076
You always did.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.648
Gwen, hi.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.486
We're getting flooded
with calls from the press.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.651
Where are you?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.865
I'm visiting Lily.

24:19.584 --> 24:23.076
Well, I can... I can hold them
off for a few hours, but that's it.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.794
I'm just...

24:25.798 --> 24:29.632
I think it's time to move on.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.297
I'll be in soon.

24:31.304 --> 24:35.263
Okay.
I'll see you then.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.404
Jamie never said it.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.409
No one said
what happened to her here.

25:47.005 --> 25:50.668
I wanted to get him.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.631
We got him.

26:01.519 --> 26:04.306
We should let the Larsens know.

26:28.046 --> 26:31.288
Miss Marek?

26:32.133 --> 26:34.465
If you're looking for my sister
or Stan, they're out.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.672
When are they coming back?

26:38.097 --> 26:41.009
Don't you people knock
before you just walk in?

26:41.476 --> 26:43.683
We need to speak to them.
It's about the case.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.845
Well, that's the last thing
they need right now.

26:48.107 --> 26:49.972
We got him.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.729
You did?

26:53.696 --> 26:56.153
Who is it?

26:57.075 --> 26:59.441
We should wait for the Larsens.

26:59.452 --> 27:03.195
Well... your timing sucks.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.870
They're moving, you know.
Got a new house.

27:09.378 --> 27:11.243
I got stuff to do.

27:12.006 --> 27:14.839
I'll be back in a few minutes.
You can just wait here.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.591
You might want
to step out with that

27:24.602 --> 27:27.184
before she bites your head off.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.013
It's a garage.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.554
You were there at the lake...

28:49.687 --> 28:51.348
Weren't you?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.188
You picked him up
from the ferry that night.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.481
Both of you were going
to the airport

29:03.492 --> 29:05.653
for that flight to Vegas

29:05.661 --> 29:10.781
and... that's when
he got a call...

29:11.667 --> 29:14.500
about a girl in the woods.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.094
Rosie was 9

29:29.936 --> 29:33.474
when | read her the story
of the monarch butterfly.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.974
She loved it.

29:41.989 --> 29:44.446
It was like...

29:47.328 --> 29:50.570
like she believed
the world could be hers.

29:53.709 --> 29:55.620
Everything in it.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.667
And you did, too.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.794
He was going to leave
his wife for you, wasn't he?

30:08.891 --> 30:12.349
And you both had plans, hopes.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.145
You were gonna have everything.

30:16.565 --> 30:19.602
- Michael did it.
- You should arrest him.

30:19.610 --> 30:21.521
He would have never left you.

30:21.529 --> 30:22.689
He couldn't have.

30:22.697 --> 30:26.030
You would have had that
over him forever.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.782
He didn't do it, Terry.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.705
What's going on?

30:35.835 --> 30:36.790
Mr. Larsen...

30:37.628 --> 30:39.744
Mrs. Larsen,
you need to leave now, please.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.796
You need to go downstairs.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.921
Terry...

30:48.264 --> 30:50.095
Uh...

30:55.771 --> 30:58.558
You wouldn't understand.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.023
I'm sorry...

31:01.569 --> 31:04.060
Don't do this.
Not here.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.454
Don't be mad at me.

31:13.247 --> 31:16.865
Mr. Larsen,
you don't need to be here.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.916
I didn't know...

31:24.258 --> 31:26.465
I didn't know what to do...

31:27.178 --> 31:29.089
I didn't know...

31:31.432 --> 31:33.093
Jesus...

31:34.268 --> 31:36.384
I didn't know...

31:37.271 --> 31:38.602
Forget it!
The deal is over!

31:38.606 --> 31:40.767
Listen to me.
You got to help me.

31:40.775 --> 31:43.983
She heard everything!
We can't...

31:43.986 --> 31:46.693
We can't let her go.
You know we can't let her go.

31:46.697 --> 31:49.029
No, no, no. I am not gonna
be part of this. We can't!

31:49.033 --> 31:50.148
The deal is off.

31:50.159 --> 31:52.195
This is your ticket, okay?

31:52.203 --> 31:54.535
To be free of your wife,
to have your own company,

31:54.538 --> 31:55.823
your own money.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.412
- No! I don't... I don't care!
- This is it!

31:57.416 --> 31:58.451
I don't care!

31:58.459 --> 32:00.791
I'm not gonna leave my wife.
It's over.

32:00.795 --> 32:02.285
- Call your guy.
- Do you understand me?

32:02.296 --> 32:04.628
- It is not happening. Not happening!
- Just call your guy.

32:04.632 --> 32:07.624
- You listen to me! You listen to me!
- Just call your guy Janek!

32:07.635 --> 32:09.125
- No. No, no, no. This is too far.
- Call him!

32:09.136 --> 32:10.751
She's a nobody.
Don't you see that?

32:10.763 --> 32:13.505
- Listen to me! Listen to me!
- You listen to me! Janek can do it!

32:13.516 --> 32:15.632
- You're crazy!
- I'm crazy?!

32:18.938 --> 32:20.769
I'm going back to my wife
and I'm starting all over.

32:20.773 --> 32:24.516
- Janek can do it.
- He'll kill her!

32:25.069 --> 32:25.933
Why did you call me?

32:25.945 --> 32:30.359
'Cause I can't do it.
I can't...

33:31.385 --> 33:34.718
I didn't know.

33:34.722 --> 33:37.134
I didn't know it was Rosie.

33:40.853 --> 33:43.014
Mr. Larsen!

33:43.397 --> 33:44.637
Mr. Larsen, Mr. Larsen.

33:46.901 --> 33:50.018
Your two sons are downstairs.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.940
They need
you now, Mr. Larsen.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.901
They need you now.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.916
Mitch...

34:03.459 --> 34:05.950
Mitch, please.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.247
I didn't know!

34:08.255 --> 34:10.997
Shh.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.137
Mitch!

34:18.140 --> 34:20.722
Please!

34:25.189 --> 34:29.182
Mitch, I didn't know...

34:29.193 --> 34:31.309
I didn't know...

34:35.991 --> 34:38.448
I didn't know...

34:46.627 --> 34:48.538
Please...

35:20.869 --> 35:22.825
Got a smoke?

35:22.830 --> 35:24.240
I'm out.

35:25.499 --> 35:30.084
You should quit.
Save me some bank.

35:35.175 --> 35:38.508
Transporting her to county
in a couple of hours.

35:41.599 --> 35:43.965
She didn't want a lawyer.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.353
Just the wrong place
at the wrong time.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.190
Sometimes it just comes down
to that, I guess.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.816
Just the randomness.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.940
Carlson told me
to give you this.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.247
Hey, what's going on?

36:09.877 --> 36:11.367
What do you want, Ron?

36:11.378 --> 36:13.915
Oh. Yeah, I got the Rosie Larsen
film from the lab.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.920
Some kind of student film.

36:15.924 --> 36:19.542
Turn the light off,
close the door. Thanks.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.475
Do we have a meeting scheduled?

37:11.230 --> 37:13.516
I wanted to get a jump start.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.856
On what? The staff
won't be here for a while.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.065
We don't have anything
on the books.

37:17.069 --> 37:20.561
Mayor, congratulations.

37:22.366 --> 37:24.197
And thank you for your help
with those charges.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.987
They were ridiculous.

37:25.994 --> 37:28.155
Police have a habit
of arresting the wrong man.

37:28.163 --> 37:31.155
- Or should I say woman?
- You got that right.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.827
Take those seats.

37:32.835 --> 37:34.996
Mr. Mayor.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.834
Mr. Ames.

37:36.839 --> 37:39.672
Michael, I hear the DA's
speaking to your attorney.

37:39.675 --> 37:41.040
Yeah, it's not gonna
be a problem.

37:41.051 --> 37:43.793
They're working out a deal.

37:43.804 --> 37:46.671
We're all here.
Let's start.

37:47.975 --> 37:52.139
It's a lovely sunny morning
in Seattle, as usual.

37:52.146 --> 37:55.434
Let's turn to page 3, shall we?

37:55.441 --> 37:58.774
Mom! Dad!
Get out of bed!

37:58.777 --> 38:02.235
Mom! Dad!
You've got to get up! Hurry!

38:12.374 --> 38:15.241
Someone left it in the mailbox.

40:13.704 --> 40:15.490
Yeah. Holder.

40:17.708 --> 40:20.495
What?
You got to be kidding me.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.003
Yeah. Yeah, whatever,
we'll be there.

40:28.302 --> 40:31.044
They found a body
down near Sea-Tac.

40:31.555 --> 40:34.797
Lieu says we're first up.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.497
Linden...

41:04.546 --> 41:06.923
we got the bad guy.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.498
Yeah?

41:09.509 --> 41:12.046
Who's that?

41:14.973 --> 41:17.055
Hey, keep in touch.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.935
You're my ride, you know?
