WEBVTT

01:55.850 --> 01:59.186
- Morning.
- Good morning, my love. Hm.

02:13.935 --> 02:15.235
Hm.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.448
Hm.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.488
Mom?

03:09.389 --> 03:10.558
We got to go.

03:25.006 --> 03:26.908
Yo, Stevie. It's on.
Polo Boy is coming.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.376
He's coming.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.612
Hello?

03:31.646 --> 03:32.947
Stevie?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.682
Fucking phone.

03:34.716 --> 03:36.684
- Baby, put your seatbelt on.
- Okay.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.532
I heard you praying
again this morning.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.634
So?

03:53.668 --> 03:56.470
Well, you never pray.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.404
That's not true.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.975
- What were you praying about?
- Doesn't matter.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.310
I was just, like, praying.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.546
Nothing specific. Just...

04:05.580 --> 04:07.414
You praying for your mother
to get better?

04:10.585 --> 04:12.319
- Mom...
- Were you praying for me to get better?

04:12.352 --> 04:14.055
- Mom!
- You love me.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.890
Why do you have to know so bad?
I don't have to tell you.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.692
I don't have to tell you
every time I pray

04:17.725 --> 04:19.527
what I pray for.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.063
You don't have
to worry, baby.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.430
I'm going to be fine.

04:24.799 --> 04:26.266
Going to be just fine.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.473
- Yes?
- You got to move.

04:33.508 --> 04:34.776
This is where
the ambulances come in.

04:34.809 --> 04:36.409
Can I have 30 seconds, please?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.079
- I'm sorry, man.
- My mom's in there.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.914
No. You got to go now.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.349
See?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.921
Shit. One second.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.055
Goddamn it.

04:51.859 --> 04:54.095
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.365
- How'd it go?
- Hm, yeah.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.634
Good, A-okay.

05:01.936 --> 05:02.837
Seatbelt.

05:06.373 --> 05:07.440
What'd he say?

05:08.142 --> 05:09.577
Said I'm good.

05:23.658 --> 05:24.959
Did you look at schools?

05:27.028 --> 05:28.062
Mm-hm.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.099
Did you really?

05:32.133 --> 05:33.534
Yes.

05:33.568 --> 05:35.136
Swear to God.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.805
I just don't want you
wasting another year.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.006
That's what I've been doing?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.473
You know what I mean.

05:42.043 --> 05:45.445
You get better,
then I'll go to school.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.714
That's the deal.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.852
Not at the table, please.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.121
- What's with you?
- Could you just

05:54.155 --> 05:56.557
turn it off, please?

05:56.591 --> 05:57.525
Please?

05:59.492 --> 06:02.797
Henry, can you
tell your girlfriend...

06:02.830 --> 06:03.865
- Rachel.
- Yes, Rachel.

06:03.898 --> 06:04.932
Please, tell her, Rachel,

06:04.966 --> 06:06.100
that we're eating.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.939
They're giving me
confusing directions.

06:19.479 --> 06:20.181
Henry?

06:22.516 --> 06:23.584
Sorry, Mom.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.720
Sorry.

06:31.926 --> 06:33.527
Mom, this is all delicious.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.730
I'm sorry, but may I,
please, be excused?

06:39.834 --> 06:40.801
Yeah.

06:43.204 --> 06:45.873
<i>Hi, sorry
it took so long.</i>

06:45.907 --> 06:46.974
Can't really hear you.

06:48.109 --> 06:49.911
<i>I'm sorry I didn't call before.</i>

06:50.912 --> 06:52.079
Oh, it's okay.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.948
<i>My day was just, it was nuts.</i>

06:55.683 --> 06:56.617
Really?

06:58.485 --> 06:59.954
What happened?

06:59.987 --> 07:01.923
<i>Nice to meet you too.</i>

07:01.956 --> 07:02.857
<i>Bye.</i>

07:03.758 --> 07:05.793
<i>Uh, sorry.</i>

07:05.826 --> 07:07.828
<i>Yeah, uh, it was fine.</i>

07:07.862 --> 07:13.901
<i>I met my roommate, and... it
sounds like you're at a party.</i>

07:13.935 --> 07:16.504
No, I have a new neighbor.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.072
<i>So, are you coming?</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:19.974
Yeah, I'm going
to leave in a second.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.243
<i>Okay, I can't wait to see you.</i>

07:22.276 --> 07:23.144
Yo.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.847
<i>Hello?</i>

07:28.149 --> 07:30.117
Sorry, yeah, me too, I...

07:30.151 --> 07:32.987
I'm excited. I love you.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.689
<i>Love...</i>

07:39.293 --> 07:40.528
Been here a while?

07:44.265 --> 07:47.034
Hope you don't mind me asking,
but, uh, how old are you, man?

07:48.269 --> 07:49.469
19.

07:50.671 --> 07:51.572
Why?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.542
No reason. Just curious.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.511
So, why they call you Polo Boy?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.548
No one calls me that.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.683
Oh, sorry, uh. Richard, right?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.821
No. Um, I live right here.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.760
That makes a lot more sense.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.198
Anyways, I'm Stevie.

08:18.299 --> 08:21.168
- Henry.
- Yeah, nice to meet you, Henry.

08:22.136 --> 08:23.504
You too, Stevie.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.742
Well...

08:29.944 --> 08:31.645
Yo.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.980
How long?

08:36.017 --> 08:38.753
Yeah, yeah,
Steve will be here.

08:38.785 --> 08:39.886
Actually, sorry.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.890
- Can you tell her to turn the music down?
- Can you hear me?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.659
- My, my mom is just...
- Can you hear me?

08:45.693 --> 08:48.996
...she's trying to sleep,
and she needs her rest, so.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.765
- For sure, Henry. Yeah.
- I'll see you soon.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.933
And whatever you do,
don't ever take her shit.

08:55.603 --> 08:56.637
Stevie!

08:56.670 --> 08:58.139
- Yes!
- Yeah! What's up?

08:58.172 --> 09:01.942
- Hey, how you doing?
- Oh, so good.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.911
I do need you to turn
your music down, though,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.580
because this young boy's
mother is trying to sleep.

09:09.350 --> 09:10.584
Sorry.

09:15.189 --> 09:16.590
Hey, Stevie...

09:36.744 --> 09:37.878
Ooh!

09:39.046 --> 09:40.114
Mm!

09:45.352 --> 09:48.222
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.403
Can you come over?

10:38.806 --> 10:39.874
I got to get back.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.343
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:43.377 --> 10:44.378
Hopefully.

10:53.888 --> 10:56.190
Yo, Ana, open up.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.426
Henry, who is that?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.063
Yo. I can hear you.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.006
Who, who the fuck is that?

11:14.241 --> 11:15.743
What the fuck
are you doing here?

11:19.514 --> 11:20.981
Come meet my friend Stevie.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.219
What is going on?

11:26.420 --> 11:27.955
Nothing.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.057
Everything's fine.
Just go back to bed.

11:31.292 --> 11:31.959
I need another one.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.128
When did you take the last one?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.297
You want me to get it myself?

11:36.330 --> 11:37.464
- I can do that.
- No, no.

11:37.498 --> 11:38.399
I'll do it. I'll do it.

11:38.432 --> 11:39.366
All right.

11:55.517 --> 11:58.152
Where's
your girlfriend tonight?

11:58.185 --> 12:00.120
She's at some party.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.222
Mm.

12:01.255 --> 12:02.957
And you're stuck here with me.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.227
I'm not stuck
here with you.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.462
I want to be here with you.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.132
Sometimes, I'm needy.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.002
I know.

12:25.446 --> 12:26.981
- Mom?
- Hm?

12:28.816 --> 12:29.883
What's going on with you?

12:34.922 --> 12:35.823
Nothing.

12:39.193 --> 12:42.997
Anyway, sorry
this is a long message.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.167
Call me back, if you can
and you want to

12:47.201 --> 12:49.236
or, you know,
I hope you're having fun.

13:09.323 --> 13:10.357
What the fuck!

13:16.864 --> 13:19.300
It says
here you missed a UTOX.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.603
What? No, I didn't.

13:21.636 --> 13:23.605
Oh, you know what it is?

13:25.205 --> 13:27.575
My phone is busted. See?

13:29.376 --> 13:32.012
You'll have
to contact your doctor.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.381
But I sampled clean.
It says it right there.

13:35.416 --> 13:39.420
So, can I please
just have my Tang?

13:39.453 --> 13:40.954
Can I help you?

13:40.988 --> 13:43.457
Hi, uh, pickup
for Miss Rebecca Fine.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.958
Okay.
Give me a minute.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.628
Could you please
fill this, then?

13:46.661 --> 13:48.996
Where'd you get this?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.865
Where do you think I got it?

13:51.899 --> 13:53.434
I got it from
the doctor's office.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.171
We should call the police.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.375
Okay, yeah.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.944
Yeah.
You should call the police.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.346
You should get them
on the phone right now.

14:05.379 --> 14:06.581
I will tell them a little bit

14:06.614 --> 14:08.315
about what it is
you guys do here,

14:08.349 --> 14:10.317
about the croaker scripts
that you filled yesterday.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.022
You're not going to help me out?

14:15.055 --> 14:18.392
Wow. The way that you
treat people is horrifying.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.594
You should be ashamed.

14:20.595 --> 14:23.163
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

14:23.197 --> 14:24.098
Actually...

14:25.099 --> 14:26.934
Thank you.

14:27.968 --> 14:28.969
Excuse me.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.506
Excuse me, sir?

14:31.539 --> 14:33.140
Sir?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.509
She can't use these
at the same time

14:34.542 --> 14:36.043
as her fentanyl patch, okay?

14:37.044 --> 14:37.945
Okay.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.347
Thank you.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.482
Have a good day.

14:53.595 --> 14:55.195
Hi. Are you okay?

14:56.397 --> 14:57.431
Sorry. I'm your neighbor.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.268
No.

15:02.403 --> 15:03.437
No, I'm not,

15:04.338 --> 15:05.305
because, um,

15:07.542 --> 15:11.679
they are profiling me,

15:11.713 --> 15:15.182
and I didn't do anything wrong.

15:16.216 --> 15:20.154
And, um, my phone,

15:21.121 --> 15:24.358
my phone is busted. See?

15:24.391 --> 15:27.529
So, what am I supposed to do?
It's not my fault.

15:27.562 --> 15:28.462
You know?

15:33.133 --> 15:36.704
Do you think you could,
um, lend me 40 bucks?

15:36.738 --> 15:39.139
- I'm good for it, I swear.
- Oh, I don't have any money.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.510
Just 20, then?
I'm good for it, I swear.

15:42.544 --> 15:45.379
I really don't have any money.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.280
Sorry.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.351
There's someone watching you.

15:53.788 --> 15:58.392
I'm hypoglycemic.
I kept the wrapper so I can pay.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.061
Can you leave me alone?
Or I'm going to post a video

16:01.094 --> 16:03.263
of this bull-fucking-shit
harassment.

16:10.572 --> 16:12.339
Think this shit shoots video?

16:15.042 --> 16:15.710
Nope.

16:20.582 --> 16:23.350
So, my mom's really sick.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.687
Aw. I'm sorry to hear that, man.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.756
You know, I mean, could you
keep your music down?

16:30.625 --> 16:31.526
Sorry.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.095
Sure. Absolutely.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.098
Of course.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.037
Did you drive here?

16:44.071 --> 16:44.772
Yeah.

16:45.940 --> 16:49.042
Do you think you could
give me a quick ride somewhere?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.812
Real close by.

16:50.845 --> 16:52.179
- Please?
- Oh, uh...

16:52.212 --> 16:54.281
You asked me for a favor

16:54.314 --> 16:56.651
and I said, "No problem."

16:58.820 --> 17:00.053
Come on.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.623
How is being quiet a favor?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.093
Exactly.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.061
So, what did they do,
the pharmacy?

17:10.297 --> 17:14.334
You said they, um, they
should be ashamed of themselves.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.704
What do they do,
they hook you, pull the rug.

17:17.739 --> 17:20.107
They hook you, they pull
the rug. And you have to start

17:20.140 --> 17:21.843
over and over,
and they get paid for life.

17:21.876 --> 17:24.478
That is what they do there.
Oh, and they fuck up your life.

17:24.512 --> 17:25.680
They fuck you.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.618
What have you got
there in that bag?

17:36.624 --> 17:39.192
Just some allergy pills.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.769
Could I borrow your phone?

17:53.608 --> 17:54.709
Thanks, man.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.193
Polo Boy, I'm done.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.762
Be safe. Bye.

18:21.636 --> 18:23.538
Stevie, where the fuck are you guys?
I've been trying to get a hold

18:23.571 --> 18:25.205
of you all morning. Nobody's
picking up their fucking phones

18:25.238 --> 18:26.239
and mine was busted,
so I'm calling you

18:26.273 --> 18:27.341
from some random dude's

18:27.374 --> 18:28.810
mobile device.

18:28.843 --> 18:30.477
And, uh, yeah.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.213
Fucked up, man. Fucked up.

18:33.948 --> 18:35.182
Right?

18:36.918 --> 18:38.452
You are okay?

18:39.453 --> 18:40.822
I saw what happened last night.

18:40.855 --> 18:42.389
What?

18:42.422 --> 18:43.625
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:43.658 --> 18:45.158
Don't even worry about it.

18:46.326 --> 18:47.629
Could you stop here?

19:34.474 --> 19:35.475
Hello?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.684
Goddamn it.

19:45.620 --> 19:46.621
Hello?

20:18.720 --> 20:19.721
Hello?

20:51.586 --> 20:52.486
What are you doing here!

20:52.520 --> 20:53.755
Jesus!

20:53.788 --> 20:55.422
What are you doing here?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.491
- I have to go.
- Okay, just one more second.

20:57.525 --> 20:58.793
No, no, I really have to go,

20:58.826 --> 21:00.393
- right now.
- Relax. Your allergy

21:00.427 --> 21:02.329
meds are fine.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.766
Okay, can I just borrow your...

21:04.799 --> 21:06.634
No, I don't have
any fucking money.

21:06.667 --> 21:08.903
- I already told you.
- Your phone, please,

21:08.936 --> 21:10.004
if that's okay.

21:12.573 --> 21:15.375
Hi, can I please have Dr. Hurst?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.879
It's Ana. Yeah, that Ana.

21:17.912 --> 21:18.780
Thanks.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.884
Hi, Dr. Hurst.

21:22.917 --> 21:24.719
Could you call
the pharmacy for me?

21:24.752 --> 21:27.054
They won't give me my methadone
and I'm crawling out.

21:29.056 --> 21:31.959
No, I missed my UTOX
because my phone was busted.

21:31.993 --> 21:33.594
But it's not like
I'm asking for a carry,

21:33.628 --> 21:35.328
and anyway,
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:36.764 --> 21:38.065
Can you write me a scrip, then?

21:39.801 --> 21:40.802
Why not?

21:43.905 --> 21:47.407
So, when I only needed
one to get better,

21:47.440 --> 21:48.709
you gave me a hundred.

21:48.743 --> 21:50.545
And now, I need a
hundred just to get well

21:50.578 --> 21:51.612
and you won't even give me one?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.851
Wow, okay.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.656
I hope that you are so
fucking ashamed of yourself.

22:05.827 --> 22:07.962
Doc fucking Oxy.

22:09.730 --> 22:10.798
Henry?

22:16.003 --> 22:17.370
Hello, doctor.

22:20.741 --> 22:22.009
Take that silly thing off.

22:23.010 --> 22:24.111
Feel a little sick.

22:26.714 --> 22:28.448
Every little thing counts, Mom.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.382
Mm.

22:35.890 --> 22:38.593
Promise me you'll go to school,
or I'll come back and haunt you.

22:40.127 --> 22:41.361
That's not funny.

22:46.901 --> 22:48.636
I'm not, I'm not being funny.

22:50.872 --> 22:53.708
You get better,
and then I go to school.

22:53.741 --> 22:56.077
- That's the deal.
- Yes, but, um,

22:58.445 --> 23:01.916
we have to prepare
now, uh, Henry,

23:01.949 --> 23:03.517
for every outcome.

23:04.986 --> 23:05.887
What does that mean?

23:09.724 --> 23:11.759
It means that, um,

23:14.161 --> 23:16.564
things have, have not gone

23:16.597 --> 23:17.798
the way that we hoped.

23:20.835 --> 23:24.705
I've relapsed, and they want
to do everything again.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.709
All of it, plus stem cells.

23:34.148 --> 23:35.182
When do you start?

23:39.553 --> 23:41.555
I don't know yet what
I'm going to do, Henry.

23:43.124 --> 23:44.692
What does that mean?

23:44.725 --> 23:46.127
Mom, we have to get
ahead of this. We got to

23:46.160 --> 23:48.696
start right now
if we want to do anything.

23:48.729 --> 23:49.997
What "we"?

23:51.032 --> 23:53.668
Henry, listen to me.

23:54.769 --> 23:57.638
- Yosef and his wife...
- No, Mom, what are you saying?

23:57.672 --> 23:59.540
- You're going to get better.
- ...in the event, in the event that things

23:59.573 --> 24:00.608
don't work out, listen...

24:00.641 --> 24:02.209
- Mom...
- ..listen to me!

24:02.243 --> 24:03.778
I need to say this.

24:03.811 --> 24:05.478
In the event that
things don't work out,

24:05.513 --> 24:09.617
Yosef and his wife,
they will help you.

24:12.687 --> 24:13.688
All right, my love?

24:23.831 --> 24:24.832
I'm really tired.

25:37.705 --> 25:38.639
Sorry.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.715
Hey.

25:47.748 --> 25:49.016
What?

25:49.050 --> 25:50.251
Don't do this, okay?

25:52.820 --> 25:53.721
I'm leaving soon.

25:55.222 --> 25:56.590
I know you're leaving soon.

25:57.958 --> 25:58.993
Okay.

26:03.464 --> 26:06.801
Yeah, you know when I'm gone,
nothing's going to change, right?

26:12.073 --> 26:13.007
Right?

26:14.075 --> 26:14.975
Right.

26:16.977 --> 26:18.279
So, what's going on with you?

26:20.214 --> 26:21.682
Hm? What aren't you telling me?

26:35.663 --> 26:36.664
Nothing.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.037
Just going to...
just going to miss you.

26:48.909 --> 26:50.010
Going to miss you too.

27:31.852 --> 27:32.820
Henry?

27:37.057 --> 27:37.958
Henry.

27:40.127 --> 27:43.063
Mom?

27:43.097 --> 27:43.998
Get me a patch.

27:45.332 --> 27:48.202
- What? You can't take them together.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

27:48.235 --> 27:50.404
Just... bring it
to me, okay, please?

27:50.437 --> 27:52.173
Mom, you're really not supposed

27:52.206 --> 27:53.474
to take both of
those at the same time.

27:53.508 --> 27:55.743
I do it, I do it
all the time, baby.

27:55.776 --> 27:57.444
All the time. It's okay.

27:57.478 --> 27:59.013
It's okay.

28:00.948 --> 28:03.150
I'll make the appointment,
okay, to start,

28:03.184 --> 28:05.719
and I will do the stem cells
and I will do everything.

28:05.753 --> 28:07.488
Okay, my love?

28:07.522 --> 28:10.791
- Deal?
- I don't think, I don't think it's a good idea...

28:10.824 --> 28:12.359
Get me the fucking patch now!

28:33.447 --> 28:34.848
It's okay, doctor.

28:37.151 --> 28:38.285
I promise.

29:42.016 --> 29:44.985
Um, I'm going to play,
uh, her favorite song.

31:55.182 --> 31:56.183
Mom?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.391
<i>Prepare
to defend your assault.</i>

34:18.425 --> 34:20.562
<i>Are you ready to die?</i>

35:57.659 --> 35:58.760
<i>Are you doing okay?</i>

36:01.129 --> 36:03.631
<i>I suppose
that's a stupid question.</i>

36:03.665 --> 36:04.932
No, it's okay.

36:08.803 --> 36:10.203
<i>I leave tomorrow.</i>

36:11.939 --> 36:13.206
Yeah, I know.

36:14.642 --> 36:16.778
<i>I could come over if you want.</i>

36:19.379 --> 36:21.783
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.752
<i>Okay.</i>

36:25.820 --> 36:28.288
<i>I'll come by tomorrow,
then, before I leave?</i>

36:32.694 --> 36:33.594
<i>Hello?</i>

36:36.831 --> 36:38.733
<i>Don't push me away, Henry.</i>

36:38.766 --> 36:39.901
<i>Say something, okay?</i>

36:46.440 --> 36:48.475
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

36:51.813 --> 36:53.881
I hope you have a really
fun time at school.

38:30.678 --> 38:32.479
Sorry. I got locked out.

38:32.513 --> 38:33.714
But you got keys in your hand.

38:38.385 --> 38:39.887
They're the wrong keys.

38:50.463 --> 38:52.499
- What?
- You owe me now.

38:54.669 --> 38:55.703
Big time.

39:36.510 --> 39:38.679
Keep staring.

39:38.713 --> 39:40.548
I'm going to turn you
to stone, bud.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.117
I'm not staring.

39:46.087 --> 39:50.024
And my name is Henry,
by the way.

39:52.093 --> 39:53.594
Stop staring, Henry.

40:10.011 --> 40:11.712
Can you give me
your phone, please?

40:28.562 --> 40:30.598
Stevie, it's Ana.
Where the fuck are you guys?

40:30.631 --> 40:31.933
I keep trying to call you
on your phones.

40:31.966 --> 40:33.801
No one's fucking picking up.

40:33.834 --> 40:36.237
Please, can you give me
a call on this number.

40:36.270 --> 40:37.872
What, what is this number?

40:37.905 --> 40:40.574
705-555-8326.

40:40.608 --> 40:44.578
705-555.

40:44.612 --> 40:46.647
705-555-8326.

40:46.681 --> 40:48.649
705-555, 5...

40:48.683 --> 40:51.919
705... 705-555-8326!

40:51.953 --> 40:52.987
Call that number, bye.

41:08.869 --> 41:10.838
Jimmy, it's Ana.
What the fuck's going on?

41:10.871 --> 41:12.173
I keep trying to call you,
guys, and nobody's

41:12.206 --> 41:13.708
picking up their fucking phones.

41:13.741 --> 41:15.109
Can you please
give me a call back?

41:15.142 --> 41:16.777
This number is...

41:16.811 --> 41:20.081
705-555-8326!

41:20.114 --> 41:21.983
Give her a fucking call.

41:26.554 --> 41:28.255
Hey, Mom, it's me, um.

41:29.557 --> 41:32.660
I was just calling, check in.

41:33.961 --> 41:35.997
My phone's broken,

41:36.030 --> 41:38.899
so can you please give me
a call back on this number?

41:40.334 --> 41:42.737
705-555-8326.

41:45.272 --> 41:46.273
Thanks.

41:51.112 --> 41:51.912
When do your parents get home?

41:55.983 --> 41:57.585
I can just leave now
if you want.

41:58.686 --> 41:59.954
No, you can take it easy.

42:01.922 --> 42:03.090
Henry, Henry.

42:05.860 --> 42:06.927
It's cool.

42:09.030 --> 42:09.930
Just be cool.

42:10.898 --> 42:12.767
I'm cool. You be cool.

42:21.042 --> 42:22.009
What's wrong with you?

42:24.678 --> 42:26.680
Are you up right now?

42:28.149 --> 42:30.951
Are you high?

42:33.654 --> 42:34.822
No.

42:34.855 --> 42:35.956
You're not popping any

42:35.990 --> 42:39.593
of those allergy meds?

42:39.627 --> 42:41.262
I didn't take anything.

42:41.295 --> 42:42.897
Hm.

42:42.930 --> 42:44.999
- Hm. Hm.
- I didn't take anything.

42:46.033 --> 42:47.935
What?

42:50.771 --> 42:52.773
Can I have one? Come on.

42:52.807 --> 42:53.707
Can I have one?

42:54.975 --> 42:55.876
Have you got any more?

43:00.815 --> 43:01.715
Hey.

43:02.817 --> 43:03.751
Go check.

43:05.953 --> 43:06.954
Come on, you owe me.

43:06.987 --> 43:08.756
You owe me, remember?

43:26.674 --> 43:28.008
It's the guy
with the shiny hair.

43:28.042 --> 43:29.410
Yo, Ana.

43:29.443 --> 43:31.779
Open up, I need to talk to you.

43:31.812 --> 43:33.647
Please! Yo, yo,
I'll hook you up!

43:40.988 --> 43:42.022
Called you like 10 times.

43:42.056 --> 43:44.091
My phone's busted, Polo Boy.

43:44.125 --> 43:45.259
Please don't call me that.

43:47.761 --> 43:48.696
Who's this kid?

43:49.697 --> 43:51.232
That's Henry.

43:51.265 --> 43:54.301
Henry, come meet
my old pal Richard.

43:54.335 --> 43:56.837
Everybody calls him
Polo Boy or Gator Nips,

43:56.871 --> 43:58.205
on account of
the fact he used to wear

43:58.239 --> 43:59.940
these nice, little shiny shirts

43:59.974 --> 44:03.077
with an alligator
right above his heart.

44:03.110 --> 44:05.412
- Funny.
- I'm being quite serious.

44:05.446 --> 44:08.849
- Have you talked to Stevie?
- No, Polo, because my fucking phone is busted.

44:08.883 --> 44:11.118
- Well, use mine, then.
- I can't get a hold of him.

44:13.921 --> 44:16.457
I thought
you were on the program.

44:16.490 --> 44:18.859
I am on the program, Dad.

44:18.893 --> 44:20.861
27 days and not a jab.

44:20.895 --> 44:23.197
I just need a little tide-over,

44:23.230 --> 44:26.233
so could please
give me a fucking pop?

44:26.267 --> 44:27.301
I'll give it to you in the room.

44:27.334 --> 44:29.203
No, fuck that. Get out.

44:29.236 --> 44:30.738
Banana, please.

44:31.438 --> 44:32.473
She said get out.

44:32.507 --> 44:34.208
Who the fuck are you again?

44:34.241 --> 44:35.809
- That is Henry.
- My name's Henry.

44:36.844 --> 44:38.879
I'm trying to be nice to you.

44:38.913 --> 44:40.281
Yeah, so am I.

44:40.314 --> 44:43.150
That's it, guys,
fill your destinies.

44:51.125 --> 44:52.726
Don't snoop, Henry.

44:55.763 --> 44:59.099
- Okay, listen up. Are you listening?
- Mm-hm, what's going on?

44:59.133 --> 45:01.135
We need
to get that bag back.

45:01.168 --> 45:02.736
Well, I'm sorry
to break it to you,

45:02.770 --> 45:04.838
but your precious
bag is long gone.

45:04.872 --> 45:06.173
I don't
think you understand.

45:06.207 --> 45:07.509
We need to get that bag back.

45:07.542 --> 45:09.043
No, no, no,
there is no "We."

45:09.076 --> 45:11.245
I did you a favor, right,
but now I'm done,

45:11.278 --> 45:13.013
so you give me my fucking pop.

45:13.047 --> 45:15.349
Sorry,
it doesn't work like that.

45:15.382 --> 45:19.753
Rich, you can change your
shirt, right, change your hair.

45:19.787 --> 45:23.791
You can carry your little
taser toy around with you now.

45:23.824 --> 45:27.995
But you forget, I used to babysit
you, so you cut the shit.

45:29.496 --> 45:33.000
Banana, as soon as I get here,
there's a guy holding us up.

45:33.033 --> 45:34.868
That doesn't seem
fishy to you at all?

45:34.902 --> 45:36.937
Okay,
I had a gun to my head.

45:36.971 --> 45:40.441
My door was busted in,
and you think that I set you up?

45:40.474 --> 45:42.443
No, not you, Stevie.

45:42.476 --> 45:44.178
Rich, you got jacked

45:44.211 --> 45:47.481
because you were on
permanent fucking broadcast

45:47.515 --> 45:52.253
about your big bag of beans,
and you are a fucking amateur.

45:52.286 --> 45:55.322
You are a small, small person.

45:55.356 --> 45:58.359
You need to accept that,
you need to move on.

45:58.392 --> 45:59.793
I can't.

45:59.827 --> 46:02.429
That was not my bag to lose.

46:02.463 --> 46:05.299
- What do you mean?
- I mean you need to help me find Stevie.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.368
Or what?

46:08.369 --> 46:10.572
Or we're going
to end up in the back

46:10.605 --> 46:14.074
of a white-paneled van lined
with cardboard, you feel me?

46:21.282 --> 46:22.483
What?

46:24.318 --> 46:27.021
You and me
in the back of a paneled van?

46:30.491 --> 46:32.426
Yeah, that's going to happen.

46:32.459 --> 46:33.494
Hello?

46:34.629 --> 46:36.997
This is Henry.

46:37.031 --> 46:38.198
Who's this?

46:44.572 --> 46:46.173
Your hair's
all out of place, Rich.

46:46.206 --> 46:47.274
You can't get in the panel van

46:47.308 --> 46:49.043
with your hair...

46:51.145 --> 46:52.980
Sorry, this is for you.

46:55.282 --> 46:56.183
Hello?

46:57.519 --> 46:58.419
Hi, Mom.

47:02.356 --> 47:04.158
No, I'm on a friend's
because my one's broken.

47:06.360 --> 47:09.163
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no,
I am on lockdown house arrest,

47:09.196 --> 47:10.230
I'm keenly aware.

47:13.100 --> 47:14.968
I was wondering if you could
wire me a couple hundred

47:15.002 --> 47:16.103
so I can get a new phone.

47:18.038 --> 47:19.340
Yeah, no,
I haven't touched a needle

47:19.373 --> 47:20.874
in 67 days and counting,

47:20.908 --> 47:23.110
and I am on the methadone
and I have a job,

47:23.143 --> 47:25.346
even though they treat me
like a walking flashlight.

47:26.614 --> 47:28.048
Yeah, but I can't get a new job

47:28.082 --> 47:29.350
when they UTOX me
every two seconds,

47:29.383 --> 47:31.852
and I can't make my UTOX
without a phone.

47:35.456 --> 47:37.391
Yeah, no, I understand.

47:40.928 --> 47:41.629
I know.

47:43.598 --> 47:44.599
Okay, I love you.

47:52.172 --> 47:54.141
You give me my fucking pill.

47:54.174 --> 47:55.142
You going
to help me find Stevie?

47:55.175 --> 47:56.910
On our friendship.

47:56.944 --> 47:58.178
Okay, how much you got?

47:59.581 --> 48:01.382
You said you'd hook me up.

48:01.415 --> 48:03.417
Hook you up, not front you.

48:03.450 --> 48:06.286
You know how much I can get for
this right now? There's a panic.

48:06.320 --> 48:10.057
You are a shiny
fucking capitalist, Polo Boy!

48:10.090 --> 48:11.659
I don't like being called that!

48:11.693 --> 48:14.094
- Should I fucking go?
- No, no, relax, relax, relax.

48:18.332 --> 48:19.366
Okay.

48:32.446 --> 48:34.549
- You up to date?
- Yeah, I'm up to date.

48:36.216 --> 48:39.521
Uh, sorry, can...
can you brush your teeth?

48:40.655 --> 48:43.525
And maybe put on
a little makeup, please?

48:54.736 --> 48:56.937
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

49:04.077 --> 49:05.245
Fuck! Fuck!

50:33.668 --> 50:34.636
Amen.

50:51.318 --> 50:52.520
Amen.

50:58.158 --> 50:59.059
Henry.

51:02.564 --> 51:03.463
Ah!

51:04.566 --> 51:05.432
I was just thinking,

51:06.668 --> 51:09.336
why don't you come
stay with us tonight?

51:09.369 --> 51:11.873
- Just...
- Oh, no, thank you.

51:11.906 --> 51:13.641
Oh, for a few days, you know,

51:13.675 --> 51:17.244
- until things settle down.
- Mm-hm, yeah, no. I...

51:17.277 --> 51:18.580
No, I don't think so.

51:20.147 --> 51:22.750
I made a promise, son. I can't...

51:22.784 --> 51:26.353
I can't just leave you here
all on your own.

51:27.622 --> 51:29.323
Yeah, you can.

51:32.694 --> 51:34.494
So, Miss Peatree was your aunt?

51:38.900 --> 51:40.768
My mom's aunt Dodo.

51:40.802 --> 51:43.136
She's the only one
in my family who isn't a narc.

51:43.170 --> 51:48.175
It's because of her I get to
stay here, at Aunt Dodo's detox.

52:00.187 --> 52:05.325
This... fucking sucks.

52:11.198 --> 52:12.132
Here.

52:13.233 --> 52:14.368
Want to split this with me?

52:16.436 --> 52:18.472
I knew you were holding out.
Where did you get that?

52:19.974 --> 52:21.809
It's my mom's prescription.

52:25.780 --> 52:26.914
Fuck.

52:29.550 --> 52:30.718
Yes.

52:34.789 --> 52:37.290
You sure you want to, man?

52:37.324 --> 52:38.760
I'm just looking out for you,
because when I was your age,

52:38.793 --> 52:40.427
I was smoking weed
and that was it.

52:41.596 --> 52:42.730
I want to.

52:49.637 --> 52:52.507
Lick the "loli" off,
and then chew.

52:52.540 --> 52:53.708
It's a quicker, better high.

52:55.475 --> 52:58.478
Can I do it, can I do it
how you're doing it?

52:58.513 --> 52:59.547
The razor?

52:59.580 --> 53:02.182
No, you don't catch a habit.

53:06.420 --> 53:10.457
And if you do, you, you stick
with scripts as long as you can,

53:10.490 --> 53:11.926
and you do not binge-use.

53:11.959 --> 53:13.895
That's the quickest way
to O.D., you understand?

53:37.451 --> 53:38.720
So, what's he want?

53:40.688 --> 53:41.823
The Polo Boy guy.

53:44.659 --> 53:47.227
Hm, I told you not to snoop.

53:47.995 --> 53:48.896
I know.

53:49.897 --> 53:51.666
- I snooped.
- Stay out of it.

53:53.300 --> 53:54.001
Are you in trouble?

53:54.035 --> 53:55.703
No, shut up.

53:55.737 --> 53:57.638
- You shut up.
- Okay.

54:01.576 --> 54:04.779
- So, are you in trouble?
- You...

54:04.812 --> 54:09.349
Maybe just delight a little
in your lovely allergy meds.

54:11.986 --> 54:12.887
Okay.

54:18.693 --> 54:19.694
Sorry.

54:38.445 --> 54:39.881
You're missing the party.

54:43.851 --> 54:45.418
Oh, it's not a party.

54:46.353 --> 54:47.989
It's my mom's shiva.

54:52.392 --> 54:53.528
Do you know what a shiva is?

54:56.130 --> 54:57.899
Yeah, I know what a shiva is.

55:05.907 --> 55:07.608
I'm really, really sorry.

55:12.013 --> 55:12.947
That's okay.

55:17.151 --> 55:18.351
Hey.

55:21.421 --> 55:22.523
Take this.

55:23.624 --> 55:25.492
It's good
for another few months.

55:26.828 --> 55:28.596
Is this your mom's phone?

55:29.730 --> 55:30.731
Yeah.

55:35.136 --> 55:36.604
I can't take this.

55:36.637 --> 55:37.939
Yes, you can.

55:40.407 --> 55:41.676
Take it, please.

55:44.812 --> 55:46.413
Just don't answer it
when it rings.

55:49.750 --> 55:52.553
Unless it's you, right?

55:52.587 --> 55:53.588
Right.

56:00.661 --> 56:02.063
Thanks, Henry, man.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.803
I really, really appreciate it.

56:08.836 --> 56:10.605
Sure, um.

56:12.073 --> 56:13.140
What's your name again?

56:14.609 --> 56:15.943
- Ana.
- Ana.

58:43.357 --> 58:44.258
Hey.

58:44.291 --> 58:45.526
Hey.

58:50.031 --> 58:50.931
Hey.

58:55.736 --> 58:57.171
I was surprised you messaged me.

58:58.839 --> 59:00.574
Why, you texted me.

59:00.608 --> 59:01.809
No, yeah, I know.

59:01.842 --> 59:02.943
Plus, we're friends, right?

59:04.345 --> 59:06.080
- Is that what we are?
- Well, I like to think so.

59:06.113 --> 59:07.014
Why, you don't?

59:08.749 --> 59:10.618
Yeah, sure, we're friends.

59:10.651 --> 59:12.119
You look like shit,
do you want to eat something?

59:12.153 --> 59:13.821
You hungry? It's on me.

59:15.256 --> 59:17.758
Don't get the lasagna.

59:19.326 --> 59:21.629
Don't get the meatballs.

59:24.865 --> 59:27.268
I'll just have
the apple pie, please.

59:28.335 --> 59:29.804
- Please.
- Okay.

59:47.154 --> 59:48.722
All right, say when.

59:51.325 --> 59:52.326
Did I say when?

59:58.999 --> 01:00:00.734
All right, when, when, when.

01:00:00.768 --> 01:00:02.269
You didn't say when.

01:00:03.938 --> 01:00:04.972
When.

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:10.945
Hey, sweetheart,
can I get my bill over here?

01:00:10.978 --> 01:00:14.348
Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

01:00:14.381 --> 01:00:15.916
For vous.

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:16.951
Thanks, babe.

01:00:16.984 --> 01:00:18.052
Fuck you.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.692
So, how is it?

01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:26.794
It's good, thanks.

01:00:26.827 --> 01:00:27.862
Oh, it's just good?

01:00:30.831 --> 01:00:33.000
It's real good, really good.

01:00:34.268 --> 01:00:35.336
Excellent.

01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:37.905
Liar.

01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:46.213
What?

01:00:48.782 --> 01:00:49.750
What?

01:00:53.387 --> 01:00:56.757
Nothing, it's just,
it's really nice to see you.

01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:01.795
Did you bring your car?

01:01:10.938 --> 01:01:13.474
- You want to go have some fun, man?
- I am having fun.

01:01:13.508 --> 01:01:16.410
I know, but do you want
to go do something?

01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:18.913
Let's go.

01:01:18.946 --> 01:01:20.881
Let's go do something.

01:01:20.915 --> 01:01:23.150
Okay.

01:01:23.184 --> 01:01:24.952
Have you got any more
of those allergy meds?

01:01:28.489 --> 01:01:29.423
Uh.

01:01:31.225 --> 01:01:32.259
No.

01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:33.727
Are you sure?

01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:35.396
Because you hesitated.

01:01:38.132 --> 01:01:39.733
Did you just call me for drugs?

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.335
No, man!

01:01:41.368 --> 01:01:44.205
I did not, Jesus!

01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:46.240
Come on, Henry.

01:01:50.411 --> 01:01:51.445
Hello.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.914
I got a new phone.

01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:56.150
I'm not dodging you, I text you.

01:01:58.052 --> 01:02:00.254
No, green. The red
you gave me at the apartment

01:02:00.287 --> 01:02:01.722
barely tided me over.

01:02:03.457 --> 01:02:04.358
Where?

01:02:06.528 --> 01:02:08.028
Okay, why there?

01:02:09.096 --> 01:02:11.198
Yeah, yeah, I know
where it is, all right.

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:14.268
Can we make
a right at the light?

01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:15.469
It's just a quick stop.

01:02:16.504 --> 01:02:17.838
Can you change that ringtone?

01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:21.875
Sure, yeah. Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:02:42.496 --> 01:02:43.864
Stop staring.

01:02:45.399 --> 01:02:46.467
How do you
know these people?

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:47.801
I don't.

01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:53.708
Hey, can I have 20 bucks?

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:58.279
If you don't want to give it
to me, don't give it to me,

01:02:58.312 --> 01:03:01.915
but I did give you the pie
for free, man, right?

01:03:20.635 --> 01:03:22.036
Ana Banana!

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.305
And her little sidekick.

01:03:24.338 --> 01:03:26.040
Fuck yourself, asshole.

01:03:26.073 --> 01:03:27.274
What's that?

01:03:27.308 --> 01:03:29.611
I said,
"Fuck yourself, asshole."

01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:32.346
Cool. That's all you got?

01:03:32.379 --> 01:03:34.048
Well, sure we can
figure something out.

01:03:35.316 --> 01:03:37.585
Come on, Rich, you've given
me a lot more for way less.

01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:39.353
It can't go on
like this forever.

01:03:39.386 --> 01:03:41.221
Yes, I am keenly aware.

01:03:41.255 --> 01:03:43.190
- Let's just go.
- Shut up, Henry.

01:03:43.223 --> 01:03:45.092
- You shut up.
- Okay, so we good,

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.327
or we go someplace else?

01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:53.400
Short girl in the flak jacket
in front of the pink room.

01:03:53.434 --> 01:03:54.502
- Okay.
- That way.

01:03:54.536 --> 01:03:56.070
Okay, do not leave without me.

01:03:59.239 --> 01:04:02.242
Oh, hey,
can I tell you something?

01:04:03.911 --> 01:04:07.448
She would sell your soul
for something this big

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:09.983
that's probably
going to kill her.

01:04:11.318 --> 01:04:13.153
Just in case
you didn't know.

01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:21.362
What the fuck?

01:04:49.156 --> 01:04:50.157
Chill, I can get it,
no, I can get it!

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.392
Fuck you!

01:04:53.661 --> 01:04:55.429
Where the fuck is she?

01:04:55.462 --> 01:04:56.631
Hey!

01:04:58.232 --> 01:04:59.299
Man, she's here,
I'm telling you!

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:00.968
I'm not fucking lying!

01:05:01.001 --> 01:05:02.136
Fuck!

01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:05.339
I'll show you.

01:05:19.587 --> 01:05:20.954
Damn it.

01:05:27.294 --> 01:05:28.362
Ana?

01:05:28.395 --> 01:05:30.230
Ana, I think we got to leave.

01:05:30.264 --> 01:05:32.734
- What's up, man?
- I think we got to go right now.

01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:35.302
- I'm fine.
- No, no, now, Ana.

01:05:35.335 --> 01:05:36.970
- We have to go now.
- Just give me two minutes!

01:05:37.004 --> 01:05:38.706
Ana, Ana, please?
There are people here,

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:40.107
and I think
they're looking for you.

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.308
Oh, did you bring your car?

01:05:42.309 --> 01:05:43.377
Yes, that's how we got here.

01:05:43.410 --> 01:05:44.311
Yeah.

01:05:45.345 --> 01:05:47.047
Is that your coat?

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.516
Yeah, it's my coat.

01:05:50.552 --> 01:05:52.620
Wait! Wait!

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:17.745
What did you mean there
were people looking for me?

01:06:17.779 --> 01:06:19.313
Well, there were
these guys with Polo Boy,

01:06:19.346 --> 01:06:21.348
and they were surrounding him.

01:06:21.381 --> 01:06:23.585
That has nothing
to do with me.

01:06:23.618 --> 01:06:25.185
Sorry, but that's what you get

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.087
when you try and act
all tough and hard.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.690
The guy thinks he's a player,

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:31.024
but he's a cock,
you know what I mean?

01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:32.159
No, what is going on?

01:06:32.192 --> 01:06:33.393
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:06:56.216 --> 01:06:57.284
What are you looking at?

01:07:00.487 --> 01:07:01.523
I don't know.

01:07:02.624 --> 01:07:03.625
Speed up.

01:07:03.658 --> 01:07:05.259
Why?

01:07:05.292 --> 01:07:07.461
We're being followed, speed up.

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:08.495
What?

01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:16.538
Okay, take the next exit.

01:07:45.365 --> 01:07:46.534
Turn your headlights off.

01:07:57.177 --> 01:07:58.412
Should we go?

01:07:58.445 --> 01:07:59.614
One sec.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:04.351
Is your car running?

01:08:04.384 --> 01:08:05.720
Yeah.

01:08:05.753 --> 01:08:07.220
Okay, keep your
headlights turned off.

01:08:08.288 --> 01:08:10.592
Ana, please tell me
what the fuck is going on.

01:08:10.625 --> 01:08:13.393
Who the fuck?

01:08:21.234 --> 01:08:25.272
Fuck your white-paneled
van, you pussies.

01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:30.210
Oh, shit, shit!

01:08:56.804 --> 01:08:57.671
Ana.

01:08:58.706 --> 01:09:00.240
I didn't leave that light on.

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:10.518
Wait, Ana.

01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:11.551
What are you doing?

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.895
I have a knife.

01:09:20.928 --> 01:09:25.767
If you don't get out in three
seconds, I'm going to stab you.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:28.268
Ana, what
the fuck are you doing?

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.773
Ana, stop.

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:33.707
Put the goddamn knife down.

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:43.685
Oh, guess maybe
I did leave the light on.

01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:10.812
He's here! He's here!

01:10:10.845 --> 01:10:12.547
The guy in the mask is here!

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.584
Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.

01:10:17.885 --> 01:10:20.387
What the fuck, take off
your mask. Think that's funny?

01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:21.889
You know him?

01:10:21.923 --> 01:10:24.625
Jimmy, take off
the fucking mask.

01:10:26.326 --> 01:10:27.394
Dude, what happened?

01:10:29.429 --> 01:10:30.397
Where's Stevie?

01:10:34.502 --> 01:10:35.536
Stevie's dead.

01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:38.539
Well, that's not funny,
where is he?

01:10:40.608 --> 01:10:41.609
He O.D.-ed.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.915
Those pills we stole

01:10:47.949 --> 01:10:50.450
from your friend,
Polo Boy, they were fake.

01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:02.730
Fuck.

01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.058
Shit.

01:11:35.763 --> 01:11:37.799
Sorry if I scared you
back there, um.

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:40.701
I thought you were someone else.

01:11:40.735 --> 01:11:41.836
You didn't scare me.

01:11:44.872 --> 01:11:45.873
Okay.

01:11:50.477 --> 01:11:51.579
Fuck.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.649
Please don't hurt her.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.521
What if she hurts me?

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:04.759
She's vicious.

01:12:04.792 --> 01:12:06.060
Would you protect me from her?

01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:07.962
She's coming.

01:12:08.863 --> 01:12:11.599
Jimmy, man,
do you have anything?

01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:13.701
Please, just anything.

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:17.104
Come on, man, I need something.

01:12:20.407 --> 01:12:21.108
Please?

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:26.581
Please, come on.

01:12:52.673 --> 01:12:54.709
Look, I hate
to have to ask you,

01:12:54.742 --> 01:12:58.546
but... have you still got it?

01:12:59.513 --> 01:13:00.882
The bag?

01:13:05.452 --> 01:13:06.453
Yeah.

01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:10.124
Where is it?

01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:11.058
Shit.

01:13:12.226 --> 01:13:13.928
Shit. Jimmy, come on.

01:13:15.663 --> 01:13:18.065
Jimmy, what are you doing,
don't answer the door.

01:13:22.603 --> 01:13:26.607
Jimmy, do not answer
the fucking door.

01:13:26.641 --> 01:13:27.842
Jimmy.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:29.744
Jimmy, don't answer...

01:13:29.777 --> 01:13:31.879
Fuck.

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:37.518
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

01:13:39.053 --> 01:13:40.621
Is he here yet? Where is he?
Where's Stevie?

01:13:40.655 --> 01:13:41.856
Oh, he's right behind you.

01:13:42.924 --> 01:13:45.526
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:47.595
Stop, right there!
Take the fucking mask off.

01:13:49.563 --> 01:13:51.498
Take the fucking mask off.

01:13:51.532 --> 01:13:52.767
- Ana.
- Shut up.

01:13:59.774 --> 01:14:01.474
You.

01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:02.510
You cop from me?

01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.581
You burned me.

01:14:07.615 --> 01:14:09.917
It's not me who burns people.

01:14:13.988 --> 01:14:16.090
Not so fucking tough
now, huh, bitch?

01:14:16.123 --> 01:14:17.959
Yeah? Want a taste
of your own medicine?

01:14:18.926 --> 01:14:20.061
Ana, come on.

01:14:20.094 --> 01:14:21.195
Shut up, Henry.

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:24.031
Did you know
the pills were fake?

01:14:24.065 --> 01:14:24.966
What?

01:14:29.003 --> 01:14:30.671
Did you know
the pills were fake?

01:14:30.705 --> 01:14:32.206
No, the pills weren't fake.

01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:34.942
Yeah,
they were fake, yeah.

01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:36.677
How do you know?

01:14:36.711 --> 01:14:41.582
Because 40 milligrams of
oxy will barely get you up,

01:14:43.284 --> 01:14:46.654
let alone kill you,
which means they weren't oxy,

01:14:48.089 --> 01:14:50.791
which means they were
fucking fake.

01:14:50.825 --> 01:14:53.027
What the fuck is
he talking about?

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.629
Rich, Stevie's dead.

01:14:56.664 --> 01:14:58.299
He O.D.-ed on one
of your shady pills.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:15:01.902
No, actually, Ana, on half.

01:15:01.936 --> 01:15:03.137
I took the other half.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:06.974
Jesus Christ.

01:15:10.277 --> 01:15:12.013
What was in it?

01:15:12.046 --> 01:15:13.047
I don't know.

01:15:14.582 --> 01:15:18.619
- Where did you get them from?
- Don't worry about where I got them, okay?

01:15:18.652 --> 01:15:21.255
Worry about giving the bag back!

01:15:21.288 --> 01:15:22.790
- Help me out here!
- No.

01:15:26.794 --> 01:15:28.796
Okay, what?

01:15:28.829 --> 01:15:30.698
You stole a fucking
bag of drugs from some people

01:15:30.731 --> 01:15:32.266
you shouldn't have
stolen them from,

01:15:32.299 --> 01:15:33.667
okay? Is that what
you want to hear?

01:15:33.701 --> 01:15:35.603
Because that's where we're at!

01:15:35.636 --> 01:15:36.537
Do you have it?

01:15:38.105 --> 01:15:39.340
Yeah.

01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:40.541
Yeah, I got it.

01:15:41.776 --> 01:15:42.877
But not here.

01:15:43.978 --> 01:15:44.912
Ana.

01:15:46.614 --> 01:15:50.718
What I do have is this.

01:15:52.853 --> 01:15:54.288
And what do you want me
to do with that?

01:15:54.321 --> 01:15:58.259
I want you...
to take it.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.028
Taste of your
own medicine, right?

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:02.329
- Okay, Ana...
- Henry.

01:16:02.363 --> 01:16:03.998
You're fucked.
Bana... banana.

01:16:04.031 --> 01:16:06.200
Don't "Banana" me,
motherfucker. It's cool.

01:16:08.636 --> 01:16:12.139
Okay, how does
this suit everybody?

01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:18.245
Now, you're going
to do the other half.

01:16:19.413 --> 01:16:21.048
No fucking way.

01:16:22.216 --> 01:16:24.618
Come on. Come on.

01:16:25.653 --> 01:16:28.189
It was the best high
I fucking ever had, right?

01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:32.026
That's the whole fun of it.
You never know, right?

01:16:32.059 --> 01:16:33.260
Take it!

01:16:33.294 --> 01:16:34.195
No.

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:40.968
You killed the love
of my fucking life.

01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:44.205
You're going to take it.

01:16:48.776 --> 01:16:50.744
Okay, okay, you had your fun.

01:16:50.778 --> 01:16:51.712
My fun?

01:16:51.745 --> 01:16:52.880
Jimmy, fuck!

01:16:53.948 --> 01:16:56.317
Okay, not another
word out of anyone.

01:16:58.452 --> 01:16:59.386
Hi, Mom.

01:17:00.321 --> 01:17:02.156
I was napping.

01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:05.726
- No one's here.
- Whoa, there it is.

01:17:06.861 --> 01:17:08.729
Okay, okay.

01:17:08.762 --> 01:17:10.131
Okay.

01:17:10.164 --> 01:17:11.198
One sec.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:13.734
You wanted your bag?

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:21.108
- Oh, fuck, man! Shit!
- Whoa, Jimmy, Jimmy. Take it easy.

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:23.978
Go on, stay there and shut up.
Just, just please, shut up.

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:26.680
Put the gun down.

01:17:27.748 --> 01:17:28.649
Please?

01:17:30.484 --> 01:17:32.119
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:17:32.153 --> 01:17:33.320
- Sit down.
- Okay.

01:17:36.957 --> 01:17:38.392
Oh, come on.

01:17:38.425 --> 01:17:39.793
Come on, you can't be
more afraid of a pill

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:42.029
than this gun, right?

01:17:42.062 --> 01:17:44.365
At least with the pill,
you stand a chance.

01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:46.233
- Take it.
- Jimmy.

01:17:46.267 --> 01:17:48.435
- Take it, take it.
- I'm begging you, please.

01:17:48.469 --> 01:17:50.037
Put the gun down.

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:52.706
I promise it's going to be okay.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:54.475
Just take a deep breath...

01:17:54.509 --> 01:17:55.876
If you fucking
shoot me, man, your life...

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:03.751
I don't know!

01:18:03.784 --> 01:18:05.052
I don't know, fireworks?

01:18:05.085 --> 01:18:07.188
Oh, my god.
It's not real.

01:18:08.255 --> 01:18:11.492
It's not real.
It's not real, it's fake.

01:18:11.526 --> 01:18:14.161
Look, you see the red tip?
You see the...

01:18:14.195 --> 01:18:16.130
oh, you see the red tip?

01:18:16.163 --> 01:18:19.233
That means that it is, uh,
that means that it's fake.

01:18:19.266 --> 01:18:21.268
There's nothing in here
that's going to hurt you.

01:18:21.302 --> 01:18:23.737
- Nothing.
- Mom, what!

01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:27.141
But this on the other hand,
oh, this will.

01:18:27.174 --> 01:18:28.842
Where do you
want me to go?

01:18:28.876 --> 01:18:29.877
Fuck.

01:18:30.978 --> 01:18:33.113
Where am I going to go?
What's happening...

01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:35.816
...so unfair. Please.

01:18:39.019 --> 01:18:40.421
Mom.

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:48.195
You fucking junkie.

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:50.231
You lost me my roof.

01:18:54.301 --> 01:18:59.106
And you, what the fuck
are you still doing here?

01:18:59.139 --> 01:19:01.842
I'm not your mother. Get out!

01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:35.035
Um, sir?

01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:36.904
Hi, is it ready yet?

01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:38.839
I can't
fill this for you.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.276
Why not, we have
another refill left.

01:20:42.309 --> 01:20:45.045
Yes, but who's it for?

01:20:45.079 --> 01:20:47.881
It says here
the patient is deceased.

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:51.385
Please?

01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:20.460
Henry, Henry.

01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:22.597
Henry.

01:24:27.735 --> 01:24:28.636
Henry.

01:24:32.272 --> 01:24:33.206
Henry.

01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:36.476
Henry, you're okay.

01:24:36.511 --> 01:24:37.779
You're all right.

01:24:37.812 --> 01:24:39.179
Hey.

01:24:50.190 --> 01:24:51.593
You're wearing
my mother's dress.

01:24:53.595 --> 01:24:56.731
Sorry, I pissed myself.

01:25:00.568 --> 01:25:02.436
- Where's Jimmy?
- He's in the shower.

01:25:02.469 --> 01:25:03.738
He pissed himself too.

01:25:07.274 --> 01:25:08.710
Shit.

01:25:11.345 --> 01:25:12.580
Why'd you come back here?

01:25:12.614 --> 01:25:13.447
We need your help.

01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:19.621
I'm sorry, but I really
just don't think

01:25:19.654 --> 01:25:21.221
I can do this anymore.

01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:31.633
Where are you, you Judas fuck?

01:25:34.201 --> 01:25:34.902
Hello?

01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:38.305
Who is this?

01:25:38.338 --> 01:25:39.707
Why do you have Richard's phone?

01:25:41.475 --> 01:25:42.710
Prove it to me, put him on.

01:25:44.912 --> 01:25:45.847
Rich...

01:25:47.481 --> 01:25:49.584
It's okay. Richard, it's okay.

01:25:49.617 --> 01:25:51.385
It's okay. Shh.

01:25:51.418 --> 01:25:53.487
Can you just put him,
put him back on.

01:25:53.521 --> 01:25:54.889
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:58.893
We'll get it for you,
but we only give it to Richard,

01:25:58.926 --> 01:26:01.428
in person, alive and well,

01:26:01.461 --> 01:26:03.296
or you're never
going to see it again.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:04.966
Tomorrow is fine.

01:26:04.999 --> 01:26:06.233
Can you put...

01:26:28.589 --> 01:26:33.928
If we could just stay the night.

01:26:36.764 --> 01:26:38.666
Just stay, that's it.

01:26:42.837 --> 01:26:43.905
And a ride, just a ride,

01:26:45.372 --> 01:26:46.406
and then we'll be done.

01:26:51.913 --> 01:26:55.415
If you don't want to,
then I totally understand.

01:26:59.554 --> 01:27:01.221
Just they know who you are now.

01:27:11.465 --> 01:27:12.834
You can put us anywhere.

01:27:15.368 --> 01:27:16.671
Please, man?

01:27:19.306 --> 01:27:21.943
Jimmy's got a couple good pops.

01:27:21.976 --> 01:27:24.612
We'll share them with you, okay?

01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:31.052
Why does
anyone care this much

01:27:31.085 --> 01:27:35.322
about a bag of
stupid fake pills?

01:27:37.558 --> 01:27:42.462
Well, uh, you can sell it for,

01:27:44.098 --> 01:27:45.833
for a lot of money right now.

01:27:47.635 --> 01:27:51.539
that's why, a lot of money.

01:27:51.572 --> 01:27:53.508
We're just going
to give it to them?

01:27:55.408 --> 01:27:56.511
Yeah.

01:27:58.478 --> 01:27:59.479
Yeah.

01:28:01.549 --> 01:28:02.583
And then what?

01:28:03.918 --> 01:28:07.454
That'll be it, they'll, they'll
just leave us alone after that?

01:28:07.487 --> 01:28:08.623
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:09.924 --> 01:28:11.324
You don't have to worry.

01:28:12.392 --> 01:28:13.493
How do you know?

01:28:14.595 --> 01:28:17.497
Well, because all they want
is the fucking bag,

01:28:17.532 --> 01:28:18.800
and they're going to get it.

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:24.071
I know it doesn't seem like it,

01:28:24.105 --> 01:28:27.575
but everything's
going to get better.

01:28:29.644 --> 01:28:30.645
Oh.

01:28:40.387 --> 01:28:41.488
Are you okay?

01:28:42.957 --> 01:28:44.025
She okay?

01:28:44.058 --> 01:28:45.860
Yeah, she's fine, she's fine.

01:28:54.936 --> 01:28:56.336
I just want to say that I'm,

01:28:57.138 --> 01:28:59.472
I'm sorry that you got
roped into all of this.

01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:04.745
You seem like a good kid.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.883
Thanks.

01:29:11.719 --> 01:29:13.486
I kind of thought
you were a piece of shit,

01:29:14.522 --> 01:29:19.694
but I'm realizing you're
actually a pretty nice guy.

01:29:31.072 --> 01:29:32.640
Stevie was your boyfriend?

01:29:41.115 --> 01:29:42.083
Yeah.

01:29:44.886 --> 01:29:46.153
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:29:50.925 --> 01:29:52.560
Thanks,
I really appreciate that.

01:30:14.048 --> 01:30:15.883
What are you doing?

01:30:15.917 --> 01:30:17.118
Do you mind if I...

01:32:25.679 --> 01:32:27.314
You going to go back
to your family?

01:32:28.315 --> 01:32:29.316
I don't know.

01:32:30.384 --> 01:32:31.285
Maybe not.

01:32:34.155 --> 01:32:35.589
Well, what are you going to do?

01:32:37.191 --> 01:32:38.893
I'm going
to move in with my mom.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:41.695
Going to get back
on the program.

01:32:43.364 --> 01:32:45.132
I can't do it here.

01:32:47.201 --> 01:32:48.102
No.

01:32:50.638 --> 01:32:52.239
It's not good for me here.

01:32:54.775 --> 01:32:55.843
Yeah.

01:32:57.044 --> 01:32:59.980
Yeah, I don't really think
it's good for me here, either.

01:33:03.684 --> 01:33:07.888
Henry... you're okay, man.

01:33:13.994 --> 01:33:15.763
It's my fault that my mom died.

01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:19.366
What do you mean?

01:33:22.236 --> 01:33:24.438
I put the patch on.
I'm the one who killed her.

01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:29.243
Henry.

01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:30.344
Yeah?

01:33:31.712 --> 01:33:33.614
It's not your fault.

01:33:57.771 --> 01:33:59.406
Hey, you said
you'd be cool, man.

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.909
It's just
a precautionary measure.

01:34:02.877 --> 01:34:04.345
There's nobody in there.

01:34:05.446 --> 01:34:08.282
Nobody gives a shit about
your fake movie gun, either.

01:34:09.884 --> 01:34:11.085
Who said it was a movie gun?

01:34:17.358 --> 01:34:21.762
Henry, I never want
to see your face again, okay?

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:24.431
You're a good kid.

01:34:24.465 --> 01:34:25.966
He's a good kid,
he's a good kid.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.168
Back in a second.

01:35:08.876 --> 01:35:10.844
Surprise, surprise.

01:35:10.878 --> 01:35:12.746
What the fuck are you
guys doing here? I didn't know,

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:14.715
I didn't know you guys
would fucking be here.

01:35:17.151 --> 01:35:18.953
Yo, put the fucking guns down.

01:35:18.986 --> 01:35:20.287
- Jimmy, be cool.
- Where is it?

01:35:20.321 --> 01:35:21.322
I am being cool.

01:35:21.355 --> 01:35:23.023
I'm cool, okay?

01:35:23.057 --> 01:35:24.758
Yo, listen to me.

01:35:24.792 --> 01:35:26.227
I haven't got it on me.

01:35:26.260 --> 01:35:27.761
- I'm here to get it.
- What the hell?

01:35:27.795 --> 01:35:29.463
- Get it.
- Fuck, I don't have it!

01:35:29.496 --> 01:35:31.899
- Jimmy, calm down!
- I can't fucking get it now

01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:34.868
- because you've got fucking guns in my face!
- No, I'm done with this,

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:36.837
- I'm done with this!
- Put the fucking gun down!

01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:38.472
Get us the bag
and we're good.

01:35:38.506 --> 01:35:40.207
How do
I know that's true?

01:35:40.241 --> 01:35:41.509
You're just going
to have to trust me.

01:35:44.445 --> 01:35:47.181
Okay, the bag's
just in this room, okay?

01:35:47.214 --> 01:35:49.116
Put your fucking
gun down and go get it.

01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:50.384
You understand?

01:35:50.417 --> 01:35:52.253
Okay?

01:35:52.286 --> 01:35:53.254
Okay.

01:35:53.287 --> 01:35:54.355
Ana, I need you to run.

01:35:54.388 --> 01:35:55.322
Henry, run!

01:35:58.259 --> 01:36:00.294
- Run!
- Fuck you, you piece of shit!

01:36:00.327 --> 01:36:01.362
Run!

01:36:04.999 --> 01:36:06.066
Where the fuck is it?!

01:36:08.202 --> 01:36:09.470
I think
she went down there!

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.008
Keep looking, man!

01:36:14.041 --> 01:36:15.510
Fuck, it's an open bag!

01:36:23.585 --> 01:36:24.519
Jimmy?

01:36:25.587 --> 01:36:27.021
Jimmy?

01:36:52.246 --> 01:36:53.213
Come on!

01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:49.970
<i>Hi, you've reached Rebecca Fine.</i>

01:37:50.003 --> 01:37:51.673
<i>Please leave
a message, thank you.</i>

01:38:10.224 --> 01:38:12.459
<i>Hi, you've reached Rebecca Fine.</i>

01:38:12.493 --> 01:38:15.129
<i>Please leave
a message, thank you.</i>

01:39:03.177 --> 01:39:05.078
I need to get well.

01:39:10.484 --> 01:39:12.620
I need something
to tie off with,

01:39:12.654 --> 01:39:14.455
and I need
something to cook with.

01:39:29.069 --> 01:39:30.003
Henry?

01:39:54.428 --> 01:39:55.630
Ana, where'd you get that?

01:39:58.633 --> 01:40:00.033
Is that from my cupboard?

01:40:02.269 --> 01:40:03.538
Is that the fake one?

01:40:07.174 --> 01:40:08.375
It's okay, man.

01:40:13.781 --> 01:40:16.116
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:40:43.176 --> 01:40:44.679
Okay?

01:40:44.712 --> 01:40:45.613
Okay.

01:40:46.514 --> 01:40:47.414
Okay.
