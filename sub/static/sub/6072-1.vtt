03:09.147 --> 03:11.232
Bow to the Board.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.529
This is the boy.
Born here, in the work house.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.366
Moved to the parish farm.
Nine years old, today.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.911
- Time to be moved back here.
- What's your name?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.086
- Oliver Twist.
- Boy's a fool.

03:32.296 --> 03:34.881
Boy, listen to me.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.593
- You know you are an orphan?
- What's that?

03:38.927 --> 03:42.513
- The boy is a fool.
- You know you've got no parents,

03:42.723 --> 03:46.017
and you were raised by the parish?
Yes, sir.

03:46.184 --> 03:51.147
- What are you crying for?
- I hope you say your prayers every night.

03:51.315 --> 03:57.320
Pray for those who feed you
and take care of you, like a Christian?

03:57.487 --> 04:03.117
Well, you have come here to be
educated, and to be taught a useful trade.

04:34.942 --> 04:38.819
- Learn from the next boy.
- What am I to learn, sir?

04:39.029 --> 04:42.907
- Learn to pick out the oakum.
- What's oakum sir?

04:43.450 --> 04:49.246
Stop asking questions.
Oakum is the fibers you unpick from the rope.

04:49.414 --> 04:53.626
Then it's used again,
for the ships of Her Majesty's Navy.

04:53.794 --> 04:57.797
You're serving your country.
Now get on with it.

05:31.248 --> 05:35.126
Tom, give it a rest, will you?
We're trying to sleep.

05:38.130 --> 05:41.382
- Can't sleep. Too hungry.
- We're all hungry.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.803
- Yes, but I'm frightened.
- Frightened, why?

05:46.888 --> 05:48.514
Why?

05:48.682 --> 05:54.270
I'm so hungry. I'm frightened
I might eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.181
Oh Lord God,

06:30.348 --> 06:35.895
for the blessing of this generous
meal that Thou has placed before us,

06:36.063 --> 06:38.731
we give thanks. Amen.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.233
Please, sir.
I want some more.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.906
- What?
- Please, sir. I want some more.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.336
Fetch the Beadle!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.638
Mr. Limbkins?

08:35.432 --> 08:40.059
I beg your pardon, sir.
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

08:41.145 --> 08:45.941
For more!
Compose yourself, and answer me distinctly.

08:46.193 --> 08:50.571
Do I understand that he asked
for more, after he ate his supper?!

08:50.739 --> 08:52.156
He did, sir.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.120
That boy will be hanged.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.343
Five pounds, and a boy...

09:16.181 --> 09:19.934
When I says whoa, I means whoa!

09:23.188 --> 09:24.730
Hel... healthy...

09:25.065 --> 09:28.359
ap, ap... apprentice!

09:28.526 --> 09:30.778
Five pounds.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.323
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

09:34.491 --> 09:38.744
Young boys have been
smothered in chimneys, before now.

09:38.954 --> 09:44.500
Because they light wet straw in the chimney,
to make them come out, again.

09:44.668 --> 09:49.755
Wet straw makes smoke. Smoke puts
a boy to sleep. That's what he wants.

09:49.923 --> 09:55.552
Boys is very lazy, but there's nothing
like a blaze to get them out, in a run.

09:56.638 --> 10:02.059
It's humane, too.
Yes. Even if they're stuck in a chimney,

10:02.269 --> 10:07.439
roasting their feet makes
them struggle to extricate their selves.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.691
Yes.

10:08.858 --> 10:13.070
- He's fond of chimney sweeping?
- Loves it, Your Worship.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.323
Very well, I'll sign the indentures...

10:17.409 --> 10:23.789
to make him Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.217
My boy.

10:36.970 --> 10:42.516
My boy!
You look pale and alarmed? What's the matter?

10:43.685 --> 10:46.020
Please, sir.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.189
- What is it, my boy?
- Don't...

10:49.441 --> 10:52.735
- Now, then.
- Don't...

10:52.902 --> 10:55.779
Go on, my boy.
Don't, what?

10:55.947 --> 11:01.910
- Don't send me away to this dreadful man, sir.
- Of all the designing orphans I've...

11:02.078 --> 11:03.829
Be quiet, Beadle.

11:03.997 --> 11:09.668
- Did Your Worship speak to me?
- Yes, hold your tongue.

11:12.464 --> 11:16.258
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

11:17.802 --> 11:26.101
Take the boy away, and treat him kindly.
He seems to want it.

11:41.743 --> 11:45.621
I've just taken the measure
of 2 women who died last night.

11:45.830 --> 11:50.626
- You'll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry.
- Think so?

11:52.879 --> 11:58.133
- The prices set by the board are very small.
- So are the coffins.

11:59.552 --> 12:04.056
By the by, you don't know anyone
who wants a boy, do you?

12:06.393 --> 12:10.062
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.364
Now,

12:20.532 --> 12:24.701
you're to meet your new master.
Pull the cap off your eyes.

12:26.746 --> 12:33.085
Hold your head up, sir.
Dry your eyes, sir.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.886
- Is that you, Bumble?
- No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

12:43.179 --> 12:49.435
- I've brought the orphan. Oliver Twist.
- So this is the orphan, is it?

12:49.602 --> 12:54.356
Mrs. Sowerberry, you'll have
the goodness to come here a moment?

12:55.525 --> 12:59.695
Oliver Twist.
How comes an orphan to have a name at all?

12:59.863 --> 13:02.406
- I invented it.
- You, Mr. Bumble?

13:02.574 --> 13:07.828
I, Mr. Sowerberry. I name our
foundlings in alphabetical order.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.621
The last was 'S'.

13:09.831 --> 13:13.792
Swibble, I named him. This was 'T'. Twist...

13:14.085 --> 13:15.544
I named him.

13:15.712 --> 13:20.174
Next one that comes
will be Unwin, and the next, Vilkins.

13:20.341 --> 13:27.306
- I've got names ready right up to 'Z'.
- Why, your quite a literary character, sir.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.141
Well, well.

13:29.309 --> 13:35.272
- Perhaps I'll... maybe.
- Mrs. Sowerberry this is the orphan.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.111
- He's very small.
- He'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.949
Yes, I dare say he will,
on our food and drink.

13:46.117 --> 13:50.913
Workhouse boys always cost
more to take, than their worth.

13:51.080 --> 13:54.374
Get down stairs, you bag of bones.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.293
Charlotte,

13:56.461 --> 14:01.381
give this boy some of the cold
bits that were put by for the dog.

14:28.910 --> 14:34.331
Hope you don't mind sleeping around coffins.
Doesn't matter either way,

14:34.499 --> 14:37.668
for you can't sleep anywhere else.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.122
Open the door, will you?

16:07.759 --> 16:09.468
You the new boy?

16:09.636 --> 16:12.888
- Yes, sir.
- How old are you?

16:13.056 --> 16:14.222
10, sir.

16:14.390 --> 16:19.811
Then I'll whop you one,
when I get in, you workhouse brat.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.955
- I beg your pardon, sir, did you knock?
- I kicked.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.750
Did you want a coffin, sir?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.628
- You don't know who I am?
- No, sir.

16:44.796 --> 16:48.256
I'm Mr. Noah Claypole,
and you're under me.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.927
Now, take down the shutters!

16:55.598 --> 17:01.228
Saved a nice bit of bacon for you,
from the master's breakfast.

17:04.357 --> 17:11.154
In the corner, and be quick about it.
They want you to mind the shop. You hear?

17:11.321 --> 17:15.701
- You hear, Workhouse, in the corner.
- Noa, let the boy alone.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.913
Let him alone?
Everybody's let him alone.

17:20.080 --> 17:24.710
His mother, father,
and all his relations, has let him alone.

17:24.877 --> 17:29.840
So he needs someone who don't.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.818
Supper!

17:51.195 --> 17:55.824
Oliver, ain't you done yet?
I've never known such an idle boy.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.452
Get down them stairs.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.164
Mr. Sowerberry?
Supper.

18:02.331 --> 18:05.333
- I've had a thought, my dear.
- A thought?

18:05.501 --> 18:10.505
- Be careful, you'll get brain fever.
- It's about young Twist.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.675
What about him?
- Very good-looking boy.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.719
He will be. He eats enough.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.640
There's an expression of
melancholy in his face, my dear.

18:20.808 --> 18:24.227
He would make a delightful mute, my love.

18:25.313 --> 18:30.776
I don't mean a regular mute to attend
grown-up funerals, my dear,

18:30.902 --> 18:34.571
but only for children's practice.

18:49.003 --> 18:52.714
Look at him.

18:53.841 --> 18:57.928
Workhouse boy and a sneak.
Look at him.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.096
Mark my words, he'll be hung.

19:00.765 --> 19:05.143
Can't be too soon.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.855
Workhouse?
How's your mother?

19:10.024 --> 19:16.154
- She's dead.
- What she die of, Workhouse?

19:16.614 --> 19:21.409
Oh, you gonna cry, Workhouse?
What set you off?

19:21.869 --> 19:24.162
Not you.

19:26.457 --> 19:30.043
- Not me?
- No, not you.

19:30.211 --> 19:34.422
You better not say anything about my mother!

19:34.590 --> 19:38.844
Better not?
About your mother?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.138
Well, I'm very sorry,
and I pity you very much.

19:42.306 --> 19:46.184
But your mother was a regular,
right-down, bad'un.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.440
What did you say?
- A regular right-down bad 'un.

19:52.608 --> 19:58.488
It's good she died when she did, or she'd
be hard laboring or transported... or hung!

19:58.698 --> 20:00.448
That's most likely, isn't it?

20:03.452 --> 20:05.328
Help, Misses, Charlotte!

20:05.621 --> 20:07.247
He'll murder me! Help!

20:08.833 --> 20:11.209
Help! Get off!

20:11.377 --> 20:12.711
For God's sake!

20:13.045 --> 20:14.212
Help me!

20:15.339 --> 20:17.632
- Beast! Animal!
- He's murdering me!

20:17.884 --> 20:20.176
Get off! Get off me, now!

20:20.344 --> 20:23.972
- I've got him now. Got hold of him.
- Let me near him!

20:24.223 --> 20:27.684
Workhouse devil!
I'll learn you!

20:27.894 --> 20:33.023
- Oh, you brat!
- Get the door, Charlotte. In with him. In!

20:41.115 --> 20:43.617
Very violent indeed, sir.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.997
And the misses said,
if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

20:49.165 --> 20:53.752
then Mr. Bumble's to flog him,
because the master's out.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.468
- He's in there.
- Oliver?

21:01.636 --> 21:03.470
Let me out of here!

21:03.638 --> 21:06.431
- Do you know this here voice, Oliver?
- Yes!

21:06.599 --> 21:11.019
Aren't you afraid of it, sir?
Aren't you trembling as I speak, sir?

21:11.187 --> 21:13.146
No!

21:16.901 --> 21:20.612
- He's mad.
- It's not madness, it's meat.

21:20.780 --> 21:25.784
Meat. You over-fed him. If you'd kept
him on gruel, this would never have happened.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.663
Dear, dear. This comes of being liberal.

21:31.040 --> 21:35.377
- What's all this?
- Oliver Twist has turned violent.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.755
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

21:42.426 --> 21:46.930
Now then, now then.
You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?

21:47.181 --> 21:49.182
He called my mother names.

21:49.475 --> 21:54.813
And what if he did? Ungrateful wretch!
She deserved what he said, and worse!

21:55.022 --> 21:56.898
- She did.
- It's a lie!

22:01.696 --> 22:06.074
Do something Mr. Sowberry.
He called me a liar.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.160
Do something!

25:31.780 --> 25:32.614
I...

25:35.242 --> 25:37.368
I beg you pardon, miss...

25:37.536 --> 25:40.788
but would you be so kind..

25:40.956 --> 25:43.082
Get off my land.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.710
We don't want no beggars here!
Go on!

25:46.086 --> 25:51.132
Get off, or I'll put the dog on you!

26:29.296 --> 26:34.467
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.303
Be careful, it's hot.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.276
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.989
My eyes ain't what they were, but..

26:56.156 --> 27:02.036
I just thought for a moment, that...

27:07.042 --> 27:11.546
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

27:12.715 --> 27:15.383
- Where are you headed?
- London, ma'am.

27:16.135 --> 27:20.263
London? London!

27:20.431 --> 27:25.727
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

28:49.770 --> 28:50.853
Hello, my man.

28:52.731 --> 28:56.401
What's your game?

28:56.527 --> 28:59.779
You're not from these parts?

29:00.531 --> 29:03.908
Where you from, then?

29:04.076 --> 29:06.953
I've been walking. 7 days.

29:07.162 --> 29:11.791
7 days? Cor!
I expect you want grub?

29:12.918 --> 29:14.460
And you shall have it.

29:14.628 --> 29:20.091
I'm at a low-water mark myself,
at the moment, but I'll fork out and stump.

29:20.259 --> 29:23.553
Come on, up with you. On your pins.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.606
- Thank you very much.
- There you are, dear.

29:35.774 --> 29:40.862
By the by, my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.572
Oliver Twist.

29:44.324 --> 29:47.952
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.996
That's why.

29:57.629 --> 30:01.924
Got any lodgings? Money?

30:02.092 --> 30:06.512
Suppose you want some
place to sleep tonight, don't you?

30:43.717 --> 30:47.678
- Buy your 'Daily News'! One penny!
- Fresh melon!

30:48.639 --> 30:51.849
I expect you walking so
long was a Beak's order?

30:52.017 --> 30:55.686
- What's that mean?
- Don't you know what a Beak is?

30:55.854 --> 31:00.900
- A bird's mouth, isn't it?
- You are green! A beak's a magistrate.

31:01.068 --> 31:05.655
- Where you been all your life?
- Get off me you...

31:11.119 --> 31:15.373
...I want to talk to you...
...she's coming up...

31:16.959 --> 31:18.793
I thought it was here.

31:20.837 --> 31:23.297
...Put your back into it.

31:31.765 --> 31:33.266
...Where I am, mate...

31:39.314 --> 31:41.399
Just give it here...

31:46.905 --> 31:48.322
Knock it off...

31:55.581 --> 31:58.082
- Now, then.
- Plummy and slam.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.546
- There's two of you. Who's he?
- A new pal.

32:03.714 --> 32:06.799
- Where's he from?
- Greenland. Where's the old'un?

32:06.967 --> 32:10.595
Upstairs, sorting the wipes.

32:26.737 --> 32:30.114
This is him, Fagin.
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

32:30.282 --> 32:34.201
Well, well, Oliver Twist.

32:36.079 --> 32:40.666
I hope I have the honor
of a more intimate acquaintance.

32:40.834 --> 32:45.671
Very glad to see you, Oliver.
Dodger, take off the sausages.

32:46.340 --> 32:51.135
Let's make a space
at the table, for Oliver.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.764
You're staring at the
handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

32:54.931 --> 32:59.101
There's a lot of them.
We just got them ready for the wash.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.312
That's all, my dear.

33:02.856 --> 33:06.525
Blow it. Hot.

33:09.738 --> 33:14.492
Now, then, Oliver?
What you must have, is a hot gin and water.

33:14.660 --> 33:21.874
Warms the cockles. Only drink it quick,
because another gentleman wants the tumbler.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.230
Such a nice lad.

33:44.398 --> 33:51.445
I've the feeling he'll
turn out a hard worker.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.971
Oliver?

35:36.510 --> 35:38.510
Clever dogs.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.733
Fine fellows.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.697
Fine fellows...

36:21.346 --> 36:27.101
Why are you awake? What have you seen?
Speak out! Quick, or it's your life!

36:27.811 --> 36:31.438
I wasn't able to sleep longer.
I'm sorry I disturbed you.

36:31.606 --> 36:35.192
- You weren't awake a moment ago?
- No sir.

36:38.905 --> 36:44.159
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I only tried to frighten you.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.746
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

36:49.583 --> 36:53.961
- Did you see any of those pretty things?
- Yes, sir.

36:54.087 --> 36:59.258
They're mine.
My little property.

36:59.426 --> 37:04.346
For my old age.
It's our secret.

37:04.514 --> 37:10.019
You understand, my dear?
Yes sir. Can I get up now, sir?

37:55.607 --> 37:59.276
- I hope you've been at work.
- Hard as nails.

37:59.444 --> 38:02.738
Good boys. Good boys.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.491
- What you got, Dodger?
- Pocketbooks.

38:05.659 --> 38:09.703
- Lined?
- Pretty well.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.553
I don't know, Dodge.

38:31.351 --> 38:38.357
Not as heavy as they might be.
Very neat, and nicely made.

38:38.525 --> 38:42.069
- Ingenious workman, ain't he Oliver?
- Indeed, sir.

38:43.196 --> 38:46.532
- Charley, what have you got?
- Wipes.

38:46.700 --> 38:47.658
Wipes?

38:52.080 --> 38:55.958
They're very good ones. Oh, very!

39:01.423 --> 39:08.178
You haven't marked them well.
The marks should be picked out with a needle.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.807
- We'll teach Oliver how to do it?
- If you like, sir.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.686
You'd like to make them
as easy as Charley Bates?

39:15.854 --> 39:18.564
Very much.
If you'll teach me, sir.

39:18.857 --> 39:22.026
I never met anyone so green!

39:39.002 --> 39:42.379
Now then, boys.
The game.

39:44.466 --> 39:48.594
We'll show Oliver how
to make pocket handkerchiefs.

39:51.139 --> 39:54.975
- You'd like to play a game, wouldn't you?
- Yes, sir.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.482
- Got the time, guv?
- It's... 8 o'clock.

41:34.951 --> 41:39.329
- Playing the game, were we?
- As is our custom, my dear.

41:39.539 --> 41:42.916
- He's new. Who's he?
- This is Oliver.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.668
Oliver,

41:45.545 --> 41:49.715
these are our very good
friends, Bet and Nancy.

41:52.093 --> 41:57.514
Dodger, you want to learn from him.
He's got manners, he has. Proper gentleman.

41:58.016 --> 42:04.563
- We popped in because we're that cold inside.
- As is your custom, my dear.

42:05.398 --> 42:09.276
Oliver, join us.
Or don't you sit with common folk?

42:10.278 --> 42:14.198
Be careful of this lot.
They'll have you pickin'...

42:14.407 --> 42:19.411
Picking out the marks. That's what we
was teaching him, ain't it Oliver?

42:19.621 --> 42:24.917
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir? You know who you're talking to?

42:25.084 --> 42:29.838
- What'll your mom say about you being here?
- I'm an orphan.

42:30.006 --> 42:34.468
You're in the right company, then.

42:35.303 --> 42:39.473
I'll teach you how to play.
It's called Spec or Speculation.

42:39.641 --> 42:44.853
3 cards each and then
the one he turns up, is trumps.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.783
This is a pleasant life, ain't it, my dear?

43:01.120 --> 43:05.707
- When can I go out, sir?
- Soon. Soon.

43:09.045 --> 43:11.880
Lets see what you've learned.

43:12.048 --> 43:15.801
- Would you like that?
- Oh yes, sir.

43:15.969 --> 43:21.890
See if you can take this out,
without my feeling it.

43:48.751 --> 43:50.961
Is it gone?

43:52.672 --> 43:55.674
You're a clever boy, my dear.

43:55.842 --> 43:59.803
I never saw a sharper lad.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.101
Here's a shilling for you.

44:07.854 --> 44:12.107
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.
Especially the Dodger.

44:12.275 --> 44:16.028
He'll be a great man himself.
Make you one too.

44:16.195 --> 44:21.116
You go on this way, you'll be
the greatest man of the time.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.870
Thank you, sir.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.466
Lovely white apples.
Lovely apples.

44:41.179 --> 44:43.680
Biggest cabbages in town. Come on.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.851
That one with the wide brim.

44:48.770 --> 44:50.479
Too expensive.

45:40.113 --> 45:43.615
Thief!
Your handkerchief, sir. Thieves!

45:48.121 --> 45:49.871
Stop!
Thief!

45:52.083 --> 45:52.916
Thief!

45:55.128 --> 45:55.961
Him!

46:21.279 --> 46:23.113
That way!

46:27.034 --> 46:29.327
Stop, thief!

46:32.081 --> 46:33.206
Stop that boy!

46:39.630 --> 46:41.256
Where's the gentleman?

46:43.134 --> 46:46.303
- Give him air.
- Where's the gentleman?

46:50.850 --> 46:53.226
- Where's the gentleman?
- Here he is.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.396
- This the boy?
- I'm afraid it is.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.065
Afraid it is.
That's a good one.

46:59.233 --> 47:02.569
- Poor fellow's hurt himself.
- I did that, sir.

47:02.778 --> 47:06.490
Hurt my knuckle again his mouth,
but I stopped him.

47:06.699 --> 47:09.034
- Get up.
- It wasn't me, sir.

47:09.202 --> 47:12.621
- It wasn't me.
- Course not. It never is. Get up!

47:12.788 --> 47:17.542
- Don't hurt him.
- Oh no, sir, I won't hurt him.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.298
This way, gentlemen.

47:25.426 --> 47:28.345
- What's next?
- That's my name and address, sir.

47:28.638 --> 47:30.722
Officer, who is this fellow?

47:30.890 --> 47:33.058
- My name is Brownlow.
- Be quiet.

47:33.226 --> 47:35.769
What's this fellow charged with?

47:35.937 --> 47:40.148
Oh, no, he's not charged.
He appears against the boy.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.401
- Swear him.
- I must beg to say one word...

47:43.569 --> 47:45.529
- Hold your tongue.
- I won't, sir!

47:45.696 --> 47:47.864
Hold your tongue!

47:48.074 --> 47:53.036
Your and insolent, impertinent fellow.
How dare you bully a magistrate.

47:53.204 --> 47:56.581
Swear this person,
I'll not hear another word.

47:56.749 --> 48:00.252
I do solemnly swear to tell
the truth, so help me God.

48:00.378 --> 48:03.296
- What's the charge?
- I was standing...

48:03.464 --> 48:06.800
Hold your tongue!
Policeman, what is this?

48:06.968 --> 48:09.302
- Are there any witnesses?
- None.

48:09.470 --> 48:13.348
- The boy is ill.
- Yes, I dare say.

48:13.516 --> 48:17.811
Come on vagabond, none of your tricks here.
What's your name?

48:17.979 --> 48:18.812
Water.

48:19.146 --> 48:23.608
What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?
Officer, what's his name?

48:23.901 --> 48:24.943
Your name, boy?

48:25.570 --> 48:27.904
Some water.
Some water.

48:28.155 --> 48:31.241
- His name is Sam Waters.
- Where does he live?

48:31.450 --> 48:35.954
- Where do... anywhere he can, Your Worship.
- Stuff and nonsense.

48:36.122 --> 48:39.833
- Don't try and fool me.
- I think he really is ill.

48:40.001 --> 48:42.794
I know better, or my name's not Fang.

48:43.129 --> 48:45.213
Stand away, he's shamming.

48:46.424 --> 48:49.884
He stands committed for 3 months.
Hard labor. Clear the office.

48:50.177 --> 48:54.514
- Stop! Don't take him away!
- What is this? Who is this?

48:54.682 --> 49:00.020
- Turn this man out.
- I will not be turned out! I will speak!

49:00.187 --> 49:02.147
I saw it.
I own the bookshop.

49:02.815 --> 49:05.025
- I must speak.
- What's there to say?

49:05.401 --> 49:08.236
- It was not this boy.
- Who was it then?

49:08.529 --> 49:12.449
2 other boys robbed him,
while he was reading. I saw it.

49:12.617 --> 49:16.369
- This boy was amazed by it.
- Why didn't you come before?

49:17.079 --> 49:21.958
- I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.
- Reading, you say? A book, then?

49:22.460 --> 49:25.253
Yes.
The one he has in his hand.

49:25.421 --> 49:27.255
I forgot all about it.

49:27.423 --> 49:32.927
You're a nice one. To prefer
a charge against an innocent boy.

49:33.095 --> 49:40.060
I consider that you obtained that book under
suspicious and disreputable circumstances.

49:40.227 --> 49:44.272
- Bookseller, do you want to press charges?
- Certainly not!

49:45.608 --> 49:49.444
Think yourself fortunate
that he declines to prosecute.

49:50.029 --> 49:53.490
- The boy is discharged. Clear the office!
- Damn me!

49:53.658 --> 49:57.452
Clear the office! Next case!

49:57.745 --> 50:02.874
Come on. Move along, sir, please.
There's a good gentleman, move along.

50:03.626 --> 50:06.961
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

50:10.341 --> 50:13.301
Make way for the law, sir.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.304
Careful with him.

50:18.766 --> 50:22.769
Call a coach, pray.
I'm sorry.

50:24.563 --> 50:25.438
Poor boy.

50:30.986 --> 50:33.238
- Mind yourself, madam.
- Thanks.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.783
- Got one, sir.
- Thank you, officer.

50:37.535 --> 50:41.204
Let me, sir.
Here we go.

50:42.998 --> 50:46.334
- Could you drop me off, sir?
- Course.

50:46.502 --> 50:51.381
Alright.
If you could just take his head, sir.

50:51.549 --> 50:54.384
- Where to, sir?
- Pentonville.

50:54.510 --> 50:57.137
- Pentonville.
- Yes.

50:57.638 --> 51:01.558
Answer me! Where is he?
Speak out, or I'll throttle you!

51:01.767 --> 51:04.769
The traps have got him.
Let go of me!

51:12.611 --> 51:13.445
Bull's-eye!

51:14.238 --> 51:17.532
Who pitched this at me?
Who done it?

51:19.535 --> 51:23.204
Bull's-eye. Come in, you sneakin' warmint.

51:23.372 --> 51:26.916
What you stopping outside for?

51:27.084 --> 51:28.710
Lay down.

51:30.671 --> 51:34.132
What you up to, Fagin?
Ill-treating the boys again?

51:34.592 --> 51:38.386
I wonder they don't murder you.
I would if I was them.

51:38.554 --> 51:42.265
Don't speak so loud.
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

51:42.433 --> 51:45.101
Give us a drink, and don't poison it.

51:45.311 --> 51:47.270
Charley.

51:47.438 --> 51:49.230
Good stuff, Bill.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.358
So, Dodger,

51:52.568 --> 51:55.487
what's it all about?
A new boy.

51:55.654 --> 51:59.407
Come out before he was ready.
Got nabbed by the traps.

51:59.575 --> 52:05.663
You see, Bill, I'm afraid he may say
something that'll get us into trouble.

52:07.208 --> 52:11.252
Your blowed upon, Fagin.
And about time.

52:11.545 --> 52:16.508
I'm afraid that if the game was
up with us, it would be worse for you,

52:16.675 --> 52:19.302
then it would be for me, my dear.

52:20.137 --> 52:25.183
Somebody's gotta find out,
at the office, what's being done to him.

52:25.351 --> 52:30.563
- Somebody gotta get him.
- I ain't going near there. Not for nobody!

52:31.023 --> 52:35.193
I have the very thing, Bet will go.
Won't you, my dear?

52:35.361 --> 52:36.569
Blessed if I will.

52:36.695 --> 52:41.658
- Nancy, what do you say?
- It won't do, don't even try.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.868
- What you mean?
- What I say.

52:43.994 --> 52:48.081
You're just the person.
Nobody knows anything about you.

52:48.249 --> 52:53.211
I don't want them to neither!
Its more "no" than "yes" with me, Bill.

52:53.379 --> 52:55.421
- She'll go.
- No she won't, Fagin.

52:55.589 --> 52:57.549
Yes she will, Fagin.

53:08.561 --> 53:09.686
Can I help you?

53:09.979 --> 53:11.855
I'm looking for my brother.

53:12.648 --> 53:15.191
- Who would he be?
- Lovely little boy.

53:15.359 --> 53:18.528
Lovely manners.
Gentle as falling snow.

53:19.572 --> 53:24.784
We don't get many of those.
I think you'll be wanting Mr. Fang's court.

53:30.708 --> 53:34.043
George?
This young lady's looking for her brother.

53:34.211 --> 53:38.631
- I think he's the one that fainted.
- A gentleman took him away.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.885
What gentleman?!
Heavens, what gentleman?!

53:42.344 --> 53:47.765
- Well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.
- Oh my god.

53:47.933 --> 53:52.353
Wait, his card's here somewhere.

54:01.989 --> 54:04.449
Thank you, sir.

55:03.676 --> 55:06.761
Mr. Brownlow!

55:35.582 --> 55:40.211
There's something in him
that touched my heart, Mrs. Bedwin.

55:40.421 --> 55:45.550
- Can't explain it.
- I feel the same, sir.

55:45.718 --> 55:49.679
Who is he? What is he?
You know nothing of him!

55:49.847 --> 55:51.973
He had a fever. What of that?

55:52.474 --> 55:54.767
Bad people have fevers.

55:54.935 --> 56:00.314
A man in Jamaica who was hanged for
murdering his master, had a fever 6 times.

56:00.733 --> 56:03.735
- I know there is goodness in him.
- How?

56:03.986 --> 56:07.071
And innocence.
I knew it from the beginning.

56:07.239 --> 56:13.578
He'll deceive you. Let you down just
like all your other innocent causes.

56:13.746 --> 56:18.416
If that boy's good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

56:27.134 --> 56:29.469
How do you feel, my dear?

56:29.636 --> 56:31.220
Very happy, sir.

56:31.388 --> 56:36.309
- And very grateful to you, indeed, sir.
- Good boy.

56:36.477 --> 56:40.146
Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin?
Any slops?

56:40.314 --> 56:43.191
Not slops, sir. Broth.

56:43.776 --> 56:49.280
A couple glasses of port wine would
have done him more good, right, Sam?

56:50.491 --> 56:51.949
My name is Oliver.

56:52.785 --> 56:54.869
Oliver?

56:55.037 --> 56:58.831
- Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
- No, sir, Oliver Twist.

57:00.334 --> 57:04.545
- Why did you tell the officer it was Waters?
- I didn't, sir.

57:05.547 --> 57:08.341
- You did not?
- No, sir.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.888
- You're not angry, are you, sir?
- No.

57:15.015 --> 57:18.017
Queer name, Oliver Twist.

57:20.312 --> 57:24.482
- There are many books, are there not?
- A great number, sir.

57:26.110 --> 57:29.112
I never saw so many.

57:30.697 --> 57:35.118
How would you like become
a clever man, and write books?

57:35.285 --> 57:37.829
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

57:38.038 --> 57:41.874
Wouldn't you like to be a book writer?

57:42.042 --> 57:45.503
I think I'd rather
be a bookseller, sir.

57:47.673 --> 57:51.384
You have said a very good thing.

57:51.552 --> 57:52.802
Well, well,

57:52.970 --> 57:58.808
we won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade to be learned.

57:58.976 --> 58:02.353
- You going to send me away, sir?
- No, my child.

58:02.521 --> 58:06.566
I'm not going to desert you,
unless you give me cause.

58:06.733 --> 58:12.446
- I never will, sir.
- I hope not, because I trust you.

58:12.656 --> 58:13.781
Thank you, sir.

58:23.417 --> 58:27.378
- Glad I won't have to wear those again.
- We all are, my dear.

58:29.798 --> 58:31.090
There.

59:28.440 --> 59:32.193
Hello.
What's that?

59:32.361 --> 59:34.237
This is Oliver Twist.

59:34.404 --> 59:39.283
- A bookseller's boy brought this.
- Stop him. There's books to go back.

59:39.451 --> 59:43.037
- That the boy who had the fever?
- That's the boy.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:14.193
- No sign of him, sir.
- Oh dear, I'm sorry for that.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:18.489
- I wish some books to be returned, tonight.
- Send Oliver.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.451
- He's sure to deliver them safely.
- Do let me take them.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.871
If you please, sir, I'll run all the way.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:37.883
You shall go.
Mrs. Bedwin will show you the way.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:44.098
And Oliver, give the bookseller this.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.229
Money I owe him.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.529
I won't be long, sir.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:04.160
- How long should it take him?
- You think he'll come back?

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:10.458
- You don't.
- With a 5 pounds in his pocket? I do not.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:15.963
If that boy returns to this house,
I'll eat my own head, sir,

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:18.591
and yours.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:24.263
Matches...

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.813
Meat for your pets.
Finest horse meat...

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:35.066
Cats. Dogs.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.526
Oh, my little brother.

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:40.279
I don't believe my eyes.

01:01:40.489 --> 01:01:42.490
- Help!
- It's a miracle!

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:45.242
- I found him.
- Help me!

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.870
- Oh, Oliver!
- Nancy.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:52.458
- You're so naughty to make me suffer...
- Let me go!

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:58.130
- What's the matter, ma'am?
- Run away from his parents. Good people.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:02.343
Joined a set of thieves.
Broke his mother's heart.

01:02:02.511 --> 01:02:06.680
- Young wretch.
- Go home, you little brute.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:11.060
- I'm an orphan, I live in Pentonville.
- Hear how he braves it out.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.479
- What?
- It's true!

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:20.945
- Come home to your poor mother.
- I don't know him! Help!

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:25.783
Help? I'll give you help, you little wretch!

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:30.287
And these books? You been stealing?

01:02:30.497 --> 01:02:33.999
- You little villain!
- That's right. You give it to him.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.876
Bring him to his senses.

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:39.380
I will, misses.
You come with me, little wretch.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:43.134
- It'll do him good.
- Who is this man?

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.595
Mind him, Bull's-eye.
- Help! Help!

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.015
Look at him!

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.560
Hold me somebody!

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:57.773
Hold me somebody, while I laugh it out.
Look at his togs, Fagin!

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:03.279
Delighted to see you lookin' so well.
If you'd wrote and said you was coming,

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.699
we'd have got something warm for supper.

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:09.368
Hello, Fagin. That's mine!

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:12.246
It's mine, Bill.
Have the books.

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:16.667
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.128
This isn't fair, Bill.
Is it Nancy?

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:22.590
Fair, or not fair,
hand over, I tell you.

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:26.594
Give it here, you vicious, old skeleton.
Give it here!

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:33.601
For our share of the trouble.
You keep the books, if your fond of reading.

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:39.315
- They're very pretty aren't they, Oliver.
- Send them back.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:43.110
They belong to Mr. Brownlow.
The books and the money.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:47.072
- He'll think I stole them.
- The boy's right.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.826
You're right, Oliver.
They'll think you stole them.

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:59.376
- It couldn't have been better...
- Help! Help! Fetch the police!

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:03.672
- The dog will tear him to pieces.
- Serve him right.

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:05.716
Fetch the police!

01:04:08.303 --> 01:04:15.142
- Step aside or I'll split your head.
- I don't care. You'll have to kill me first!

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.189
Bull's-eye! Here. Bull's-eye!

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:31.909
Dodger, get after him!

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:16.036
You wanted to get away, my dear?
To call the police? We'll cure you of that!

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.168
I won't stand by and see this done.
You've got the boy.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.798
- What more do you want?
- Keep quiet or I'll quiet you for good.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:29.592
Let him be.

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:34.096
- Your a fine one to make friends with the boy.
- God, help me, I am.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.975
He's a thief, a devil,
all that's bad, from this night on.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:43.689
- Ain't that enough for the old wretch?
- Come, we must have civil words.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:47.026
Civil words! You old villain!

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:52.031
- I thieved for you when I was half his age.
- It's your living.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:06:00.956
And you're the wretch that drove me
to it, who might keep me at it, till I die!

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:06.128
Dodger, Charley, put Oliver to bed.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:10.132
- Them clothes are too good for sleeping.
- Charley's right.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:16.263
- This suit cost more than four pence ha'penny.
- Never felt such lovely stuff, you?

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:20.601
No. I bet it's the same
stuff the Queen wears on Sundays.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:28.901
Quick, get him. Take it off.

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:32.279
Lift him up.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:36.325
Up he goes.

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:39.411
Get his shoes.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:17.783
Little something for your luncheon?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.760
Shall we have a little chat?

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.640
Oliver? Shall us?

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:54.278
I expect you'd welcome the sound
of a human voice again, my dear?

01:07:57.031 --> 01:08:04.538
Do you know what I consider the
greatest sin in the world, my dear?

01:08:04.706 --> 01:08:06.790
Ingratitude.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:13.589
That's what your guilty of. Ingratitude.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:17.593
We took you in, cherished you,
and how do you repay us?

01:08:17.761 --> 01:08:23.890
You run away, cry out for the police,
you cause us great anxiety, and expense.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:34.318
There was a lad like you once.
He indeed, ran away to the police.

01:08:34.486 --> 01:08:38.071
Can you guess how he ended up?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:44.661
They hanged him.
At the old Bailey.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:51.502
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true, but...

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:57.841
all of it necessary to provide for my
own safety, and that of my friends.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:03.305
Poor boy. Hanged.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:08.435
Terrible thing hanging, Oliver.
Dawn, the gallows,

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:13.607
the rope, the noose.
You don't always have to be guilty.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:19.071
They'll hang you for anything, these days.
They're very fond of hanging!

01:09:27.788 --> 01:09:33.710
If you do as your told,
we'll be very good friends, yet.

01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.848
Feel free to walk about now, Oliver.

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:50.143
Yes, feel free.

01:09:57.735 --> 01:09:59.987
- Oliver?
- Yes.

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:04.867
You'll assist me in
my toilet, straight away.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:10.205
- Will you do that for me, my man?
- All right. I'll be glad of the company.

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:16.295
You may start by japanning my trotter-cases.
In plain English, clean my boots.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:25.554
- What a pity he ain't a prig.
- Don't know what's good for him.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:32.394
- Suppose you don't even know what a prig is.
- Yes I do, it's a thief.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:33.979
You're one.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:39.151
Yes I am. We all are, down to the dog. He's
the downiest one of the lot.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:44.740
- And the least given to peaching.
- He wouldn't even bark in a witness box.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:48.285
He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:52.706
Why not put yourself under Fagin,
make a fortune out of hand.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:57.252
Like your gentleman in Pentonville.
Big house, that.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.631
I had a peep at it, I did.
Nice inside, was it?

01:11:00.924 --> 01:11:05.093
Yes, and I slept in a proper bed,
in my own room.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:08.847
- Good stuff on the walls, eh?
- Yes, indeed.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:14.394
Put yourself under Fagin, and you'll
retire to a property just like that.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.563
And do the genteel.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.609
- He's scared he'll be scragged.
- I don't know what that means.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:27.699
You don't take wipes and watches,

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:33.413
some other cove will, and you have
the same right to them as they have.

01:11:34.415 --> 01:11:37.042
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear.

01:11:37.335 --> 01:11:41.797
Take his word for it, he
understands the teachings of the trade.

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:54.101
Cabbie?

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:18.083
- I've come from Bill.
- For what?

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:22.254
- For no harm.
- I don't believe it.

01:12:22.964 --> 01:12:27.134
If I could help you I would,
but I've not the power. Now,

01:12:27.468 --> 01:12:34.725
I've promised him you'll be good and silent.
If not, you'll do yourself harm. And me too.

01:12:44.277 --> 01:12:48.071
- Did he come quiet?
- Like a lamb.

01:12:50.575 --> 01:12:51.992
Sit down.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.333
And let me read you a lecture.

01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:07.758
Know what this is?

01:13:08.801 --> 01:13:11.845
- Yes.
- Well, then.

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:18.560
This is powder.

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:26.651
That's a bullet.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:34.993
And this is a little bit
of an old hat, for wadding.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:43.168
Now it's loaded.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:45.921
Yes, I can see it is, sir.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:51.468
If you speak when we're outdoors,
unless I speak to you,

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:56.056
this loading will go in
your head, without notice.

01:13:56.224 --> 01:14:00.811
If you do decide to speak without leave,
say your prayers first.

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:03.396
What you mean is,

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:08.235
if he crosses you, you'll stop him
telling tales with a shot to the head.

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:13.240
- And you'll take your chances swinging for it.
- Right..

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.700
Women always use the fewest words.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.994
Supper, Nancy.

01:14:18.329 --> 01:14:20.372
Then a snooze afore startin'.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.528
My pal Bill.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:54.072
The door's open, come in.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:59.494
Don't make such a row.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:07.669
- Show us a glim, Toby.
- Barney, a glim. Show the gentleman in.

01:15:08.045 --> 01:15:11.006
Barney?
Wake up first, if convenient.

01:15:24.103 --> 01:15:26.646
Mr. Sykes.
Come in, sir, come in.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.251
Bill, my boy. Glad to see you.

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:54.090
- Who's this?
- Only, the boy.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:57.469
- One of Mr. Fagin's lads?
- Yeah. It's time.

01:15:57.762 --> 01:16:02.057
Right.
Barkers for me, Barney.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.860
- They're loaded.
- Good.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:25.789
- The persuaders?
- Got them.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:30.627
Keys, centre-bits...

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:36.841
darkies.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.063
Nothing forgotten?

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.284
Here's all quiet.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:55.545
I can't.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.799
- You will.
- It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:33.041
Have mercy on me.
Don't make me steal from him.

01:18:33.417 --> 01:18:36.711
- Come here.
- Let me run away and die in the fields.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:40.840
- I'll never come near London.
- Shut it. Get up,

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:44.302
or I'll strew your brains on the grass.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:30.056
I'm putting you through there.
Go unfasten the front door.

01:19:30.641 --> 01:19:34.144
I can't. There's a bolt on top.
I can't reach it.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:38.940
Well, stand on a chair, or something.
Just do it.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.874
To the door! To the front door, damn you!

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.419
Who's there?

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.255
Mrs. Bedwin?

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:45.632
Is that you?

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:01.981
Grab him!

01:21:03.526 --> 01:21:07.403
Save me! Save me, for God sakes!

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:20.667
Help!

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:22.126
Police!

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:32.887
Give him here.

01:21:39.311 --> 01:21:42.730
- God, damnation, how he bleeds!
- Is he hit bad?

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.023
He's hit worse.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:51.573
Gimme a pistol.
What?!

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:57.203
We gotta get rid of him or he'll squeal.
Gotta do him in.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.623
Here, down by the river.

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:02.166
Bill! Bill!

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.880
- Help! Help!
- Bill!

01:22:12.970 --> 01:22:13.970
Bill?

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.106
Snap!

01:22:27.443 --> 01:22:28.276
Snap.

01:22:30.738 --> 01:22:31.571
Snap!

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.243
- Snap.
- No, it wasn't.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:58.306
Well, well.
How are you, Fagy?

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:02.435
Scarce, scarce!

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:05.146
- Where's Bill.
- He's... he's bleeding!

01:23:05.356 --> 01:23:08.691
- What happened?
- All in good time.

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:13.071
I can't talk business
till I've ate and drank.

01:23:19.161 --> 01:23:22.080
Nancy, I said scarce. Scarce!

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:25.875
- Where's Bill?
- Produce sustenance, if you please.

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:29.337
Dodger.
Nancy, scarce!

01:23:36.095 --> 01:23:38.680
- The crack failed.
- I smelled that.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.683
I won't ask again, where's Bill?

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:51.818
Put him to bed.
Give him a nip of gin.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:03.329
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagy.
He was seen.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.791
He was seen?
Who saw him?

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:11.838
Two old ones. He shouted out.
Bill lost his head and fired his pistol.

01:24:12.089 --> 01:24:13.005
Hit the boy?

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:17.051
I don't know.
There was 2 shots. Only one was Bill's.

01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:20.638
We ran.
I had a hold of the boy, and Bill fell.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:26.269
Fell? Was he hurt?
Last seen, he was swimming to London.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.231
Bull's-eye.

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:38.906
I told you not to bring a soul here.
Now you've brought the devil.

01:24:39.116 --> 01:24:40.742
You said to fetch him.

01:24:41.535 --> 01:24:44.412
His fever's so high, he don't remember.

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:48.124
You're not well, are you?
How do you feel today?

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:52.336
I'm as weak as water.
Get us a drink.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:59.260
- What evil wind has blowed you here?
- No evil wind, my dear.

01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:02.680
You, Bill.
You said we need to speak.

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:11.647
- Where's that boy?
- Safe and sound.

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:17.487
Dodger's minding him.
They're as close as Cain and Able.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:22.617
What about the boy, Bill?

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:30.792
We don't want him peaching on us, do we?
As long as he's alive, we're as good as hung.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.461
So, what's to be done?

01:25:35.506 --> 01:25:40.968
- Nothing, not till I'm better.
- Then what?

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:44.013
- Then I'll do for him.
- How? Where?

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:49.393
- I'll find a river somewhere, and drown him.
- The boy's weak.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:53.147
He's wounded.
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:57.318
When he can walk, tell me.
I'll fetch him.

01:25:57.945 --> 01:25:59.070
Get out of here.

01:25:59.947 --> 01:26:00.780
Yes.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:12.458
Your right.
It's for the best.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:21.092
I'm burning up.
Where's me physic?

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:27.348
You look like a walking corpse.
What's the matter?

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:32.186
Nothing.
What you looking at me so hard for?

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:36.524
- What you thinking of?
- Of many things. What's odds in that?

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:39.861
I'll tell you.
If you haven't caught the fever,

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:45.783
then there's something unusual in the wind.
And something dangerous, too.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:50.162
Give me my physic, I say.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:55.084
No, no, no.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:27:02.466
There ain't a stauncher hearted girl going,
or I'd have cut her throat 3 months ago.

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:07.805
You've got a fever coming on, that's it.

01:27:29.286 --> 01:27:32.330
Here, it'll make you feel better.

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.589
Sit aside me.

01:27:44.009 --> 01:27:49.388
Put on your own face, or
I'll alter it so you won't know it again.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:15.057
- Wait.
- Ma'am.

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.911
- Yes.
- Does Mr. Brownlow live here?

01:29:36.079 --> 01:29:38.247
Who are you? What do you want?

01:29:38.415 --> 01:29:42.793
- Go around the back.
- I have information about Oliver Twist.

01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:48.340
Is he all right?
Is he safe?

01:29:49.676 --> 01:29:53.387
Where is he?
I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:58.434
- He's not here.
- The boy's innocent. Tell him that.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:02.396
- Where is he?
- Safe.

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:07.234
- But he may not be for long.
- Where is he!?

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:25.419
I'll meet with Mr. Brownlow.
Sunday at midnight on London Bridge.

01:30:25.837 --> 01:30:30.382
If I'm not there, tell him to
come the next night, and the next.

01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:31.884
Tell him.

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:42.019
Oh, my dear, you look as good as new.

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:45.856
- How do you feel?
- Tired, sir.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:50.820
Well, yes, it is long after midnight,
shortly you'll go to sleep,

01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:54.740
but my meaning was,
how do you feel in yourself?

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:58.661
Better, sir, but for the ache in my arm.

01:30:59.579 --> 01:31:01.247
Come, sit.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:11.465
I've the very thing, for such pains as yours.
Undo the bandage.

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:32.903
It's a nasty wound.
But my magic will do the trick, you'll see.

01:31:33.822 --> 01:31:40.077
This remedy is older than time.
Yes! Older than time.

01:31:40.787 --> 01:31:47.626
It was handed down from
father to son... and comes from...

01:31:50.797 --> 01:31:52.131
who can say where?

01:31:55.677 --> 01:32:03.100
Thank you for your kindness.
I'll always remember it.

01:32:06.897 --> 01:32:11.984
Always. Yes, always, my dear.

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:18.490
But who knows how long that will be?

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:50.439
An hour this side of midnight.
Dark and heavy it is, too.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:53.442
Good night for business, this.

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.946
What a pity there's none
quite ready to be done.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.656
For once, your right.

01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:03.077
- When will the boy be ready to go traveling?
- Like I said,

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:05.871
- In a day or two.
- It's a pity.

01:33:06.039 --> 01:33:09.833
- For I'm in the humor, too.
- Does me good to hear you.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:13.629
Quite like yourself, tonight, Bill, eh?

01:33:13.797 --> 01:33:20.886
Not when you've got that withered old
claw on my shoulder, so take it away.

01:33:27.811 --> 01:33:32.022
Hello, Nance.
Where's a girl going, this time of night?

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:36.110
- Not far.
- What answer's that? Where you going?

01:33:36.278 --> 01:33:39.488
- I say, not far.
- And I say where?

01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:43.701
- I dunno where.
- And I do. Nowhere. Sit down.

01:33:43.868 --> 01:33:45.494
I want a breath of air.

01:33:45.662 --> 01:33:50.582
- Put your head out the window.
- It's not enough. I want it in the street.

01:33:54.379 --> 01:33:57.464
Then you won't have it.

01:34:02.178 --> 01:34:06.265
There. Now, stop quietly
where you are, will you?

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:13.439
Know what you're doing?

01:34:14.774 --> 01:34:19.820
Do I know what I'm... Girl's lost
her senses, talking to me like that!

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:24.867
You'll drive me to something desperate.
Let me go, this minute!

01:34:25.035 --> 01:34:25.909
No!

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:31.415
Tell him to let me go, Fagin.
It'll be better for him. Do you hear me?

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:40.049
I hear you. If I have to listen
to you for half a minute longer,

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:44.136
The dog'll tear that voice
right out of your throat.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.348
What's come over you, you jade?

01:34:47.557 --> 01:34:49.350
Bill, let me go.

01:34:50.060 --> 01:34:53.270
Let me go.
You don't know what you're doing.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:55.189
For only 1 hour.

01:34:55.357 --> 01:34:59.777
Cut my limbs off if the girl's
not stark, raving mad. Get up.

01:35:00.403 --> 01:35:02.946
- Get up!
- No.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:11.330
Now, stay there.

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:15.876
What a strange girl.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:20.631
- You may say that.
- What took it in her head to go out tonight?

01:35:21.132 --> 01:35:23.926
Obstinacy, Women's obstinacy?

01:35:24.386 --> 01:35:27.471
I thought I'd tamed her of that.

01:35:30.266 --> 01:35:35.062
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood, that won't come out.

01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:42.945
If she's like that again, I'll let her a
little blood, without troubling the doctor.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:36:00.295
Well, now she's on the other tack.

01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:06.802
Goodnight.
In 2 days, Bill, come for the boy.

01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:10.722
Light him down.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:16.186
It's a pity he should fall and
break his neck, without anyone seeing it.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:18.647
Show him a light.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:31.827
What is it, Nancy, the reason for all this?

01:36:31.995 --> 01:36:32.828
What?

01:36:32.996 --> 01:36:36.498
No matter, just now.
We'll speak of this anon.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:41.003
You have a friend in me, Nance.
A staunch friend, Nance.

01:36:41.754 --> 01:36:44.381
I know you well.
Goodnight.

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:52.431
Dodge, pull it in.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:37:00.189
My glass is full already, can't you see?

01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:07.696
Trouble.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.451
Dodger?

01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:18.624
Shall we find out where old Tom is?

01:37:18.917 --> 01:37:21.627
Shall we both take him home?

01:37:21.794 --> 01:37:24.755
Honestly, I haven't seen her.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.218
Is something up?

01:37:34.891 --> 01:37:40.812
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:44.733
What is it? I ain't going
near no police office...

01:37:44.943 --> 01:37:48.862
There's not the smallest danger in it.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:52.366
- I want someone dodged.
- Who? An old one?

01:37:52.534 --> 01:37:53.742
- Young one.
- Who?

01:37:53.952 --> 01:37:55.619
- One of us.
- Who?

01:37:56.663 --> 01:37:58.497
Nancy?

01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:01.208
What's she done?

01:38:01.376 --> 01:38:06.463
Not sure she's done anything,
that's why I want her dodged.

01:38:08.299 --> 01:38:16.431
She may want to talk to people she shouldn't.
I want to know who she sees, what she says.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:23.355
Nancy, I don't know.
She's a good one, Nancy.

01:38:23.523 --> 01:38:27.651
A pound, my dear, one whole pound.

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:10.235
Mr. Brownlow?

01:39:12.155 --> 01:39:14.072
Yes.

01:39:17.035 --> 01:39:20.078
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Follow me.

01:39:34.677 --> 01:39:36.720
This is far enough.

01:39:36.888 --> 01:39:43.477
- Why can't we speak up there?
- I told you, I'm afraid I'm being followed.

01:39:47.106 --> 01:39:50.984
I'm here because you say you have
information about Oliver.

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:53.570
- I have.
- Tell me.

01:39:55.281 --> 01:40:01.411
He's being held by a devil, and he's handing
him over to another one, that means to...

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:04.206
Is it someone close to you?

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.709
One is, one ain't.

01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:11.421
These men must be delivered up by you.

01:40:11.589 --> 01:40:17.177
Bad a life as he has led,
I've led too, and I won't turn upon him.

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:19.137
The other...

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:20.681
Fagin.

01:40:21.307 --> 01:40:23.016
He has the boy.
Fagin?

01:40:23.267 --> 01:40:24.601
Find Fagin.

01:40:24.769 --> 01:40:30.816
- Where is he?
- Spitalfields. I've already said too much.

01:40:30.983 --> 01:40:35.362
- No one must never know who told you.
- I promise.

01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:41.952
- Tomorrow, I'll put the matter to the police.
- Do it tonight. The traps know Fagin.

01:40:42.328 --> 01:40:44.037
- The traps?
- The police.

01:40:45.415 --> 01:40:50.460
- What can I do to serve you?
- Nothing, you can do nothing.

01:40:50.628 --> 01:40:54.381
- I'm past all hope, indeed.
- Take this, as a reward.

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:59.803
No. I've not done this for money.
God bless you.

01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:01.138
Goodnight.

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:06.017
Never, never say who told you.

01:41:18.114 --> 01:41:19.156
Look at him.

01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:25.328
It's a shame. With his face,
he could rob old ladies' in church.

01:41:25.496 --> 01:41:29.416
His face could be a fortune to us.

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:31.585
You changing your mind?

01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:36.214
No. No, Bill, it has to be done.

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:38.175
Fagin!

01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:46.892
- What's got into you?
- I must see Fagin alone.

01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:49.436
You can speak in front of Bill.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:52.314
Yes you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:54.691
- Nancy.
- What about her?

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:59.654
- I had him dodge Nancy.
- What do you mean?

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:01.865
Tell us.
You followed her?

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:04.242
Yes.
To London Bridge.

01:42:04.452 --> 01:42:06.745
What on London Bridge?

01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:14.002
- She met and old one. A gentleman. And...
- And? Speak will you!

01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:17.130
She peached!
She told him Fagin and Oliver.

01:42:17.298 --> 01:42:22.427
And the old man wants to
go to the traps, now, tonight!

01:42:27.475 --> 01:42:31.436
Let me go!
Don't speak to me, it's not safe!

01:42:31.604 --> 01:42:36.358
Hear me speak a word.
Bill, you won't be ...

01:42:37.276 --> 01:42:39.486
You won't be too violent, Bill?

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:58.964
Flit, boys! The traps will be at the door
before you can say Spitalfields.

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:03.943
Flit!

01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:09.743
Oh, It's you.

01:44:12.955 --> 01:44:17.876
Bill?
What's the matter?

01:44:24.884 --> 01:44:27.469
Why do you look like that at me?

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:34.559
- There's enough light for what I've got to do.
- What have I done?

01:44:34.727 --> 01:44:37.729
- Speak to me.
- You know.

01:44:37.897 --> 01:44:43.485
You was watched tonight.
Every word you said was heard.

01:44:45.488 --> 01:44:50.825
I never said your name, Bill.
Never. Never.

01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:53.078
Bill?

01:44:55.331 --> 01:44:57.123
Oh God, have mercy!

01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:23.541
Nance?

01:45:51.929 --> 01:45:55.932
I haven't done nothin'...
Be off with you.

01:46:19.874 --> 01:46:24.377
Hello, Fagy. Hello, lads.

01:46:25.254 --> 01:46:30.925
- What's the news?
- Here it is. It's all in 'The Chronicle'.

01:46:31.177 --> 01:46:32.218
Your in it.

01:46:32.428 --> 01:46:35.805
- Bill's in it. Oliver's in it.
- 'The Chronicle'?

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:40.685
Fancy that, your famous, Fagin.

01:46:40.853 --> 01:46:48.151
More is now known about the foul, and
bestial murder that happened in Spitalfields,

01:46:48.319 --> 01:46:51.237
and has appalled the citizens of London.

01:46:52.990 --> 01:46:54.199
It is believed,

01:46:54.366 --> 01:46:58.369
that a victim, a young woman,
now identified as Nancy,

01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:01.331
was brutally beaten to death...

01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:07.337
by one William Sykes,
a well known, dangerous, villain.

01:47:07.505 --> 01:47:12.342
Your correspondent has
learned that the murdered woman...

01:47:12.593 --> 01:47:17.764
had informed on her associate,
and on an infamous fence, Fagin,

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:24.020
who is now wanted for the abduction of a
young boy, Oliver Twist.

01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:31.528
Neither a Fagin nor Sykes are presently
in custody, but police are searching...

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:34.072
throughout the city, and beyond.

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:42.330
Sykes, according to the police, is usually
accompanied by a fierce, white dog.

01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:46.334
How about that?

01:48:00.266 --> 01:48:02.934
Come back here.

01:48:05.354 --> 01:48:07.021
We're going back.

01:48:09.275 --> 01:48:11.067
Got people to speak to.

01:48:11.235 --> 01:48:16.322
Force shiners out of Fagin, get to France.
Damn me, we'll risk it.

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:20.368
Not another one.

01:48:21.412 --> 01:48:23.580
Who's he done in?

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:27.917
- They say it's a woman.
- He done in a woman?

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:55.195
Bull's-eye.

01:48:57.406 --> 01:48:58.615
You hear me?

01:49:00.492 --> 01:49:03.494
You gone deaf, or something?

01:49:03.746 --> 01:49:05.747
Come here. Come on.

01:49:07.583 --> 01:49:09.250
Ain't gonna harm you.

01:49:11.587 --> 01:49:12.420
Come here.

01:49:13.839 --> 01:49:18.509
Stop it, you!
I ain't playing with you!

01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.637
Let it go, varmint!

01:49:22.139 --> 01:49:24.139
Bull's-eye!

01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:33.942
Get back here!

01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:38.446
Damn it!

01:49:43.452 --> 01:49:48.748
It's his dog! It's his dog!

01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:55.755
- Here, boy. Here.
- Don't go near him.

01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:06.432
A child is in danger, Inspector.
But you only seem interested,

01:50:06.684 --> 01:50:11.354
in capturing William Sykes.
Your concern should be for the boy.

01:50:11.522 --> 01:50:15.650
Allow me to say, this is
our way of doing business.

01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:18.569
My thinking is this.

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:24.117
If we catch Sykes, we get Fagin.
If we get Fagin...

01:50:24.285 --> 01:50:27.287
Sir, we've found the dog.

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:33.376
- We can't just wait for the traps to find us?
- Shut it.

01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:38.715
No, he's right. We should do another flit.

01:50:40.718 --> 01:50:42.760
The traps!

01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.360
What?

01:50:59.903 --> 01:51:00.987
It's him!

01:51:01.989 --> 01:51:03.865
- Don't let him in.
- We must.

01:51:05.993 --> 01:51:07.910
Go on.

01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.372
Go on!

01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:21.382
Don't leave us in the dark.

01:52:16.647 --> 01:52:18.731
Damn you all.

01:52:19.441 --> 01:52:22.235
Have you nothing to say to me?

01:52:22.403 --> 01:52:24.153
It's not safe here, Bill.

01:52:24.446 --> 01:52:27.115
If it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

01:52:31.161 --> 01:52:35.498
Is it... The body, is it buried?

01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:47.510
Dodger, let him in, quick.

01:52:51.140 --> 01:52:52.640
Do as I say.

01:52:56.645 --> 01:52:58.855
Don't come near me, monster.

01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:04.819
I'm not afraid of him.

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:10.533
If they come, I'll give him up.
I'll tell them you're here.

01:53:11.785 --> 01:53:15.288
He may kill me,
but if I'm here I'll give him up.

01:53:15.456 --> 01:53:18.666
If he's to be boiled alive, I would.

01:53:23.297 --> 01:53:24.881
Take him off of me!

01:53:31.013 --> 01:53:35.433
Help! He's here! Break down the door! Help!

01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:36.934
Please!

01:53:40.272 --> 01:53:43.649
Damn you.
Do your worst. I'll cheat you yet!

01:53:56.246 --> 01:54:02.251
- Bill, no, he's our bargaining tool.
- Not yours, Fagin. Mine!

01:54:16.808 --> 01:54:18.184
Don't fire!

01:54:19.811 --> 01:54:22.480
- Don't fire.
- Hold your fire, men.

01:54:22.648 --> 01:54:26.359
I'll let the boy go. I'll let it drop.

01:54:26.527 --> 01:54:28.986
Don't try nothing, or I let him go!

01:54:31.448 --> 01:54:33.199
Up there, over the roof.

01:54:48.048 --> 01:54:51.342
Get it. Grab a hold of that.

01:55:00.978 --> 01:55:03.813
We must give chase, sir!

01:55:14.491 --> 01:55:15.908
Get down!

01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:04.790
Grab it! Grab it!

01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:29.333
Oliver?

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:41.595
- Here he is, sir.
- Come on, my boy.

01:57:41.763 --> 01:57:46.642
Mr. Grimwig has something to say to you.

01:57:46.852 --> 01:57:53.399
- Do the honors, Mrs. Bedwin.
- Young man, I confess I misjudged you.

01:57:53.567 --> 01:57:57.486
I feared your benefactor
might make me eat my head!

01:57:58.572 --> 01:58:01.949
But he's a good friend, and has pardoned me.

01:58:02.117 --> 01:58:06.245
And one for Oliver.
And you too Mrs. Bedwin.

01:58:06.413 --> 01:58:08.456
- I don't know ...
- You must.

01:58:08.665 --> 01:58:13.377
So I'll take the liberty,
if you allow me, to salute you.

01:58:14.171 --> 01:58:15.212
To Sam Waters.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.089
Oliver Twist.

01:58:17.424 --> 01:58:20.634
Oliver Twist.
To Oliver Twist.

01:58:25.724 --> 01:58:27.057
My, Oliver.

01:58:27.309 --> 01:58:32.521
My child, what's the matter?
Why are you so sad?

01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:04.386
- Are you certain you wish to do this?
- Yes, sir.

01:59:04.554 --> 01:59:06.472
Certain.

01:59:12.521 --> 01:59:13.729
Yes.

01:59:59.568 --> 02:00:05.322
Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?
It's no sight for children, sir.

02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:11.245
It is not. But this child has seen this man
in the full career of his villainy.

02:00:11.538 --> 02:00:17.001
It is his wish, even at the cost of
pain and fear, that he should see him now.

02:00:49.576 --> 02:00:51.118
18.

02:01:06.635 --> 02:01:07.968
Ho hey!

02:01:14.184 --> 02:01:18.187
Good boy, Charley. Well done...

02:01:29.074 --> 02:01:32.534
- Take the boy to bed.
- Don't be frightened. Fagin.

02:01:33.828 --> 02:01:38.332
That's me. An old man, my Lord.
A very old man.

02:01:39.042 --> 02:01:42.461
- Someone here to see you.
- Strike them dead.

02:01:42.712 --> 02:01:44.672
Got no right to butcher me!

02:01:45.048 --> 02:01:49.093
Speak to him, now. Quickly.
He worsens with time.

02:01:51.262 --> 02:01:58.936
- Fagin, you were kind to me.
- Yes, yes. I'll be kind again...

02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:02.856
I'll be kind again.

02:02:07.445 --> 02:02:13.701
- I'm not afraid.
- Oliver!

02:02:16.079 --> 02:02:19.081
Let me whisper to you.

02:02:20.583 --> 02:02:26.672
You remember the box, Oliver?
With my pretty things for my old age?

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:32.428
It hid up the chimney, in the top front room.
It's yours, Oliver.

02:02:32.554 --> 02:02:38.434
- It's yours but we must talk.
- But shall we say a prayer together, first?

02:02:38.601 --> 02:02:43.564
Do. Say only one, upon your knees, with me...

02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:46.692
and we can talk all morning.

02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:51.697
Outside, you can say I've gone to sleep.
They'll believe you.

02:02:51.865 --> 02:02:55.826
You can get me out,
and pretty things are yours.

02:02:55.994 --> 02:03:02.791
- Oh God, forgive this wretched man.
- That's right, that will help us on.

02:03:04.461 --> 02:03:10.799
If I shake and tremble
as we pass the gallows,

02:03:10.967 --> 02:03:14.720
don't you mind. Hurry on. Yeah, yeah.

02:03:14.888 --> 02:03:17.639
- Have you more to say to him?
- Nothing more.

02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:23.604
- You'd better leave him.
- Press on, press on... softly.

02:03:23.813 --> 02:03:31.528
Softly, softly. No, no slow.
Faster! Faster! Faster!

02:04:12.946 --> 02:04:14.404
Mind yourselves.
