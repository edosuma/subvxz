00:20.388 --> 00:23.288
"Rich, handsome,
Ivy League grad..."

00:23.290 --> 00:26.025
You been putting
that one in again?

00:26.027 --> 00:28.293
He wants
"a devoted 20-year-old."

00:28.295 --> 00:30.429
He should get himself
a horse.

00:48.582 --> 00:51.583
Hey, Wilson!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.419
Come here!

01:07.468 --> 01:08.400
LOGAN:
It's like the<i> Wild Wild West.</i>

01:08.402 --> 01:09.668
Everybody's packing now.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.037
Hey!
Whoa!

01:12.038 --> 01:14.405
And every joker and his
uncle's got an assault rifle.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.109
So what's that mean,
every rookie's gotta
have a semi-automatic?

01:17.111 --> 01:18.277
Hey, you ban
submachine guns,

01:18.279 --> 01:20.145
I'll be happy
with my .38.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.280
Tell it to your congressman,
will you?

01:21.282 --> 01:22.581
The body's
really wet.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.316
I think he
was drowned.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.285
Oh, yeah, well, they drown them
in the Hudson,

01:26.287 --> 01:28.387
they may pull them up
and they dump them here, see?

01:28.389 --> 01:29.655
If he'd been drowned
in the Hudson,

01:29.657 --> 01:32.007
he'd have dissolved.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.358
Yeah, well, they soaked him
in something.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.464
Everything makes sense.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.232
Shot, then drowned.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.334
Male, 35 to 40.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.236
Shot with a .22.

01:44.237 --> 01:46.137
One in the chest--
went right through--

01:46.140 --> 01:48.340
two to the right side
of the head.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.342
Afraid they'd miss
the brain, huh?

01:50.344 --> 01:51.343
Ripe one.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.145
Breathe through
your mouth.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.347
Slugs went
to ballistics.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.616
Did you get a label
for the tux?

01:57.618 --> 01:59.451
Yeah. Tailor-made.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.687
Sugarman, Fifth Avenue.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.522
Prints?
Sent them out,

02:03.524 --> 02:05.257
but wouldn't count on them.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.326
The body
was a Popsicle.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.661
Ice crystals in his organs.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.230
He was frozen.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.331
Frozen?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.432
How long?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.234
That party he was dressed for?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.669
I'd say he was on his way
four or five years ago.

Skinny guys, yeah.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.594
Big guys--
Missing Persons has zip.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.663
The tailor who made the tux
is dead, has no records.

LOGAN:
not homeless...

03:53.667 --> 03:54.967
no one cared
enough to miss him?

03:54.969 --> 03:56.668
Somebody
cared enough

03:56.670 --> 03:58.237
to freeze him.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.539
15th street,
meat packing district--

04:00.541 --> 04:01.673
meat freezer?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.308
They don't freeze meat.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.477
It goes out fresh to stores
and restaurants.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.745
Ten-block radius
of that Dumpster--

04:06.747 --> 04:08.714
let's do all
the restaurants.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.616
After five years, what are we
even looking for?

04:10.618 --> 04:13.352
Well, how about something
that might place the body there?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.987
You got a better idea?

04:14.989 --> 04:16.989
And if we don't
find anything?

04:16.991 --> 04:20.292
We do the next ten blocks.

04:20.294 --> 04:24.329
Cerreta:
<i> one more restaurant freezer,</i>

04:24.331 --> 04:25.697
I'm never eating out again.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.333
Now, this place, they kiss
each other on both cheeks.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.735
You need a gun
to make a reservation.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.037
I got the gun;
I don't do cheeks.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.305
Yo! Yo!

04:33.307 --> 04:34.640
You mind if I take a look,
do you?

04:34.642 --> 04:37.042
Yeah, okay, but
the condenser's busted.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.477
It's gotta be replaced.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.045
You know, this really
ain't a good time.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.014
Is that right?
it going to be

04:42.016 --> 04:43.382
we have to get a warrant?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.950
I know what
you guys are looking at.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.517
You want the health inspectors
to throw my food away, right?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.053
Take it easy.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.488
Tell him to get out of there.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.757
My orange juice
is going to go bad.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.326
Yeah, laugh.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.560
It's funny, huh?

04:55.562 --> 04:58.397
You guys don't know
when to let up.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.737
You always make
your orange juice

05:05.739 --> 05:08.307
wearing a tux?

05:08.309 --> 05:10.309
The man's in
the restaurant business.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.611
He doesn't stow bodies.

05:12.613 --> 05:17.082
You know, the Forcelli family
disposes of more bodies
than fettuccini.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.685
A stiff turns up
in your freezer

05:19.687 --> 05:21.453
and you don't
know anything about it?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.422
Cerreta:
Your father ran numbers.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.625
Your uncle is under indictment
for racketeering. I'm not...

05:32.766 --> 05:35.567
I got an I.D.
pn the prints.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.036
A Mr. Joshua Foster,
Broadway producer.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.372
File's coming
from midtown south.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.924
Oh, that's great.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.475
Why the hell didn't Missing
Persons have something on him?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.477
Why does it always rain
on my birthday?

05:45.479 --> 05:46.478
Somebody screwed up.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.713
Don't take it out on me.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.115
What about this guy?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.650
Well, he can't be
too high

05:51.652 --> 05:54.353
on the Forcelli
family ladder.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.654
No felonies.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.025
What are you pushing
me around for?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.793
Mario...

06:01.795 --> 06:04.129
do you have any pals
on Broadway?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.866
Yeah, the counter man
at the deli on West 47th Street.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.034
Yo, what is this crap?

06:09.036 --> 06:11.436
I'm in Curacao
working on my tan.

06:11.438 --> 06:14.506
I come back, they find a stiff
in my freezer.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.874
I freaked out
a little bit, okay?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.810
Disposing of a body?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.745
That's obstruction
and accessory to murder.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.747
What's wrong with you guys?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.632
I called around.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.516
"Anybody hit last week?
What's in my fridge?"

06:25.519 --> 06:27.786
Wait a minute.
He's going
to whack someone,

06:27.788 --> 06:29.855
he'd stick him
in his own freezer?

06:29.857 --> 06:33.825
Let me tell you guys something
for the last time, okay?

06:33.827 --> 06:34.893
This ain't ours.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.828
We didn't whack this guy.

06:36.830 --> 06:40.565
We want
your employee records

06:40.567 --> 06:42.150
for the last five years.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.734
And then maybe we won't hit you
with obstruction.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.803
Do you understand me?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.806
Wash your hands of this.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.777
Well, thank you,
thank you very much.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.878
(<i> slams phone down</i> )

06:52.880 --> 06:54.179
You break it,
you pay for it.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.747
This is an investigation?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.516
You have three detectives
on here.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.850
They were all sleeping,
I guarantee you.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.118
Mario's busboys and waiters,

07:00.120 --> 07:02.187
most of them don't have records.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.822
No guns, no homicides.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.457
All right,
let's start with the sister.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.925
She's the one
who reported him missing.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.344
Yeah, she's
a high school teacher.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.762
Maybe she's with
the Forcelli mob.
Good.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.199
What side of the bed
did he get up on?

07:14.201 --> 07:16.668
The side with
five-year-old cases

07:16.670 --> 07:18.603
you're not going to break.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.806
I always expected
a phone call.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.641
"We found your brother."

07:22.643 --> 07:25.210
Hmm, you thought somebody
had killed him.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.945
No. I mean,
before he disappeared.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.714
I always thought they'd say
he was in a gutter

07:29.716 --> 07:30.916
on the bowery.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.584
What, a big Broadway producer?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.953
He was only successful
after he died.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.788
After<i> Bleak house.</i>

07:36.790 --> 07:39.691
Josh did three.
But before that,

07:39.693 --> 07:42.861
They all ran for a total
of 11 nights.

07:42.863 --> 07:45.964
Sometimes I even had
to pay his rent.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.532
He was a failure.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.568
get a date
He couldn't even

07:49.570 --> 07:50.569
in high school.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.770
I mean, he was finally normal.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.573
He had this big show,
he was in love.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.242
Who was he in love with?

07:57.244 --> 07:59.778
Who else? An actress.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.580
Leslie Hart.

08:04.651 --> 08:08.553
Without Joshua,
I don't know where I'd be.

08:08.555 --> 08:13.558
I, uh... wasn't much
of an actress.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.894
He told me
I could be a producer.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.529
That was his way--

08:17.531 --> 08:19.531
fixing everybody's life.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.765
Did he have debts-- Mr. Foster?

08:20.767 --> 08:21.867
Did he gamble?

08:23.537 --> 08:25.937
He gambled on the theater...

08:25.939 --> 08:26.938
and me.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.607
The play<i> Bleak House.</i>

08:28.609 --> 08:31.810
Well, a friend of mine wrote it.
We were kids.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.980
He just waved his magic wand...

08:34.982 --> 08:37.749
"Close your eyes, wish...

08:37.751 --> 08:39.985
I'll make it happen."

08:39.987 --> 08:42.687
Did he seem at all preoccupied
to you-- worried?

08:42.689 --> 08:43.889
About the show?

08:43.891 --> 08:45.624
Wedding?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.959
"Could we do it
after the opening?"

08:47.961 --> 08:49.194
Crazy things.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.696
"Should we serve shrimp
or lobster?"

08:51.698 --> 08:53.532
In the first investigation,

08:53.534 --> 08:55.634
you told the police
that you weren't concerned

08:55.636 --> 08:57.002
that he didn't come
to rehearsals.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.905
Or the projects, meetings...

08:59.907 --> 09:01.957
It wasn't unusual.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.008
Did Mr. Foster have connections
to organized crime?

09:04.011 --> 09:06.611
You mean the Mafia?

09:06.613 --> 09:08.246
Yeah.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.018
Joshua hardly had any friends.

09:13.020 --> 09:17.222
How about his partner...

09:17.224 --> 09:18.990
Mr. Wallace?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.625
Gary would know.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.627
MAN:
<i> Five, six, seven, eight..</i>

09:22.629 --> 09:23.995
One, two, three, four...

09:23.997 --> 09:25.997
Hey, where's your attitude,
folks?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.799
Come on.
Take it again.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.067
Alan...

09:29.069 --> 09:30.669
uh, ten minutes?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.671
Okay. Take ten, guys.

09:32.673 --> 09:37.809
Well, like I told the police
five years ago, I'll, uh...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.010
hardly knew him.

09:39.012 --> 09:42.013
You invested with a man
you hardly knew?

09:42.015 --> 09:43.682
Detective, I have people--
doctors, dentists--

09:43.684 --> 09:45.951
they like owning
a part of the
Broadway musical.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.020
Me? I wouldn't invest money
in the second coming.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.856
The day before his sister
reported him missing,

09:51.858 --> 09:53.091
did you happen to talk
to Foster?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.826
Five years?

09:54.828 --> 09:56.361
It's hard to remember.

09:56.363 --> 10:00.865
Well, you told the police,
quote:

10:00.867 --> 10:03.034
"My driver left me
at the theater.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.971
I expected Mr. Foster,
but he never arrived."

10:05.973 --> 10:08.006
if that's what I said,
I'm sure it's true.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.675
Your partner disappears.

10:10.677 --> 10:12.010
It seems like you might remember

10:12.012 --> 10:13.979
when you last talked
to him.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.848
Either you're not very subtle,
or I'm paranoid.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.983
Am I a suspect?

10:17.985 --> 10:20.385
I'm just testing your memory.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.954
He brought me a property,

10:22.956 --> 10:24.990
I produced it.

10:24.992 --> 10:28.293
I had no reason
to, uh, hurt him.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.395
So he hardly knew
Mr. Foster, huh?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.730
Oh, sure,
that makes sense--

10:31.732 --> 10:33.832
didn't know him,
couldn't kill him, right?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.700
What about the girlfriend?
How old is she?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.068
29. So?

10:37.070 --> 10:41.072
Five years ago
she's 24, he's 39.

10:41.074 --> 10:45.710
Yeah, well, May-December romance
is not exactly unheard of.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.381
Yeah, but December usually
comes with Santa Claus.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.715
Mm-hmm.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.784
Look, Foster
didn't have a dime.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.786
He's poor,
she's beautiful.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.021
She's an actress--

10:56.023 --> 10:57.889
she's got guys
hanging all around her.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.392
She's going to fall
for Mr. Big dreams?

11:00.394 --> 11:01.893
This Miss Hart

11:01.895 --> 11:03.895
and this partner
who doesn't know him,

11:03.897 --> 11:07.365
if those are
his friends, well...

11:07.367 --> 11:09.100
Where you going?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.440
Jimmy, Phil.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.677
Pull some yellow sheets
for me, will you?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.045
You're buying this?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.914
Wallace and Foster
were partners,

11:22.916 --> 11:24.916
but they were strangers?

11:24.918 --> 11:27.052
Then there's
the girlfriend.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.920
Foster's sister tells us

11:28.922 --> 11:32.057
he couldn't get a date
at the senior prom.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.026
This actress latches on,
and he disappears.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.128
Fellas,
I'm not arguing with you

11:37.130 --> 11:38.997
but a motive would be nice.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.399
I wouldn't trust either
one of them with my laundry.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.868
Oh, great.
Absence of trust--
that will get you

11:43.870 --> 11:44.869
an arrest.

11:44.871 --> 11:45.970
No, but this might.

11:45.972 --> 11:47.105
"Hart, Leslie:

11:47.107 --> 11:49.474
soliciting
for prostitution."

11:49.476 --> 11:51.443
She was 22.
No time.

11:51.445 --> 11:53.812
Year later, criminal
possession: coke.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.480
Pled down to
a misdemeanor.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.215
Sweet, innocent kid.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.917
Okay, it's a start.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.952
The writer of this show--
Hyland,

12:00.954 --> 12:02.053
he went to college with her.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.788
Try stimulating
his memory.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.496
Barbra Streisand...

12:11.498 --> 12:13.965
Hey, Neil Sedaka
would have been okay.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.101
I just wanted
to sell a song.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.504
Did, uh... did Foster miss
a lot of these rehearsals?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.973
A new third act-- I was
surprised he didn't come.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.843
Well, now, Mr. Hyland, you told
the police five years ago

12:24.845 --> 12:25.977
that you<i> weren't</i> surprised.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.746
So, I mean,
you know, which is it?

12:27.748 --> 12:31.116
CERETTA:
Your old college friend,
Leslie Hart--

12:31.118 --> 12:33.418
did she
seem worried?

12:33.420 --> 12:36.121
Uh... I suppose so.

12:36.123 --> 12:39.023
Suppose?
You didn't ask her?

12:39.025 --> 12:42.994
You write songs,
make up lyrics.

12:42.996 --> 12:47.031
Try writing a melody called
"Accessory After The Fact."

12:49.836 --> 12:53.872
That week we were supposed
to rebuild some sets.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.039
They didn't do it.

12:55.041 --> 12:58.076
Josh said they
were running out of money.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.079
The day he disappeared,
did you talk to him?

13:03.016 --> 13:06.217
Look, I didn't want
to accuse anybody.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.125
The show-- if it didn't happen,
I would have been nowhere.

13:14.127 --> 13:18.062
If you withhold evidence,
you're going to be somewhere

13:18.064 --> 13:20.899
and not this nice.

13:20.901 --> 13:24.002
Gary and Josh
were seeing new investors.

13:24.004 --> 13:28.306
Josh said he'd be at rehearsal
that night with good news.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.942
He never came to the theater.

13:30.944 --> 13:34.479
So, did Wallace come up
with the good news?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.114
Gary came late.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.882
He looked sick.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.051
Said it was bad seafood.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.988
Said he never saw Josh,
didn't know where he was.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.590
You believed him?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.065
I made mistakes.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.584
I was young.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.102
You make a right turn from the
left lane, that's a mistake.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.105
Prostitution and drug dealing?

14:01.107 --> 14:02.373
I was broke.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.977
It was an escort service,
not sex for money.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.078
No. Drugs for money.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.914
CERRETA:
Can we tie
something down here?

14:09.916 --> 14:12.150
The night
Mr. Foster disappeared...

14:12.152 --> 14:14.552
I told him, all of it--

14:14.554 --> 14:17.055
the drugs, everything.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.323
You were at rehearsal?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.860
I... guess.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.128
Five years ago.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.264
I've lived a lifetime
since then.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.266
Mr. Wallace
was with you
that night?

14:28.268 --> 14:31.202
Um... he probably
would have been.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.006
He wasn't out with Mr. Foster,
looking for investors?

14:35.008 --> 14:37.008
Your production--
we heard

14:37.010 --> 14:39.410
they were cracking open
piggy banks for it.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.380
They were running out of money.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.016
Well, Josh and Gary
never told me.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.117
I... Maybe...

14:48.188 --> 14:49.354
I know that week

14:49.356 --> 14:52.257
he was seeing a woman
named Marilee Katz.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.993
She books
charity parties.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.397
They were running out of money.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.166
Why do you think
they came to me?

15:02.168 --> 15:04.102
You don't look like a banker.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.037
Theater charity parties,
Detective.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.138
You don't need a banker.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.940
I take your show
to the United Way

15:08.942 --> 15:12.010
for their annual benefit,
they fill your entire theater.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.111
Did you sell tickets

15:13.113 --> 15:14.345
for<i> Bleak House?</i>

15:14.347 --> 15:16.080
Do I look like I'm crazy?

15:16.082 --> 15:18.383
I don't book a show if I don't
think it's gonna open.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.051
I mean, everybody knew that

15:20.053 --> 15:22.220
that show was in financial
trouble.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.055
The night you talked
to Wallace,

15:24.057 --> 15:25.957
you want to open your
diary now and tell us

15:25.959 --> 15:27.091
when he was here?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.160
The I.R.S.--
they tell you seven years.

15:29.162 --> 15:33.665
After two field audits,
I keep my diaries forever.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.971
Gary Wallace, he produced more
dogs than a mongrel in heat.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.073
Do you really think
that Gary could have done...?

15:42.075 --> 15:44.042
I mean,
whoever killed Josh Foster,

15:44.044 --> 15:46.077
it wouldn't have been
somebody like Gary.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.147
The time he was here,
please. Thank you.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.050
Sorry.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.119
I saw him 6:00 p.m..

15:55.121 --> 15:56.654
Had a dinner reservation--

15:56.656 --> 15:59.424
Denovi's in the Village,
8:00 p.m..

15:59.426 --> 16:02.126
He had to be out of here
by 7:00.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.129
7:00 to 9:00, Wallace could
have been anywhere.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.130
It doesn't nail him.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.365
What else have we got?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.499
We don't know
where Wallace was.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.968
We don't know
where Hart was.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.820
The original
investigation?

16:11.821 --> 16:13.671
That could have been in Swedish
for all it tells us.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.007
Too many young detectives.

16:16.009 --> 16:20.078
Gentlemen, now for me,
if I was gonna get shot,

16:20.080 --> 16:21.379
I'd like to be wearing a tux.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.448
You'd hit all the big parties,
would you?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.317
For this kind of occasion,
I'd rent.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.252
The blood splatter,
see how it's pulled?

16:28.254 --> 16:30.254
He was sitting down.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.155
On what?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.156
Something soft.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.524
I'd say a cushion, sofa...

16:33.526 --> 16:35.126
Could have been a bed.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.461
How about a car seat?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.997
Possible.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.000
Maybe.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.235
Young detectives.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.037
Again?

16:46.039 --> 16:48.139
We love the theater.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.242
That rehearsal, the one
that Mr. Foster missed--

16:51.244 --> 16:53.277
you were there all night?

16:53.279 --> 16:57.515
You remember where you
were five years ago?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.051
Yeah-- I remember that
I wasn't in business

17:00.053 --> 17:02.087
with a man who disappeared.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.122
Look, you said you were driven
to the theater, right?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.557
So? It's a crime
to ride in limousines?

17:06.559 --> 17:09.027
You use a service?
Your own car?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.161
I had a driver.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.162
Still got him?

17:11.164 --> 17:13.431
I fired him.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.800
He used to leave a shot
of bourbon on the dashboard.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.068
It made me nervous.

17:17.070 --> 17:19.203
You remember his name?

17:21.307 --> 17:24.208
Yeah,
it was Danner.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.209
Lloyd Danner.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.211
I hired him
from some service.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.480
He worked for me
maybe six months.

17:29.482 --> 17:33.317
And do I remember
anything else about him? No.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.555
Danner, Lloyd:

17:37.557 --> 17:42.060
Dannemora, five to 15,
criminal possession two.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.162
A knife fight--
died in the yard.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.115
That's convenient.

17:47.116 --> 17:50.067
Mr. Wallace remembers his driver
who just happens to be dead.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.469
The cellmate, Paul.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.470
It's our only shot.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.105
Cons talk to cellmates.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.207
Let's offer the cellmate a deal.

17:56.209 --> 17:59.143
Uh... Pollard.
Major narcotics.

17:59.145 --> 18:04.115
Judge McKay says he should stay
in his cell till he rots.
Come on.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.818
We don't cut this guy a deal,
there's no use talking to him.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.153
This crime
is five years old, Paul.

18:11.491 --> 18:15.126
McKay says if it's
absolutely necessary.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.127
I'll drive.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.195
Good.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.201
Okay, so you spent a year
in a cell with Danner

18:23.203 --> 18:24.602
and you
might remember.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.437
Lloyd had his fingers
in a lot of pies.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.239
What flavor you want?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.511
I saw the papers.
Body in a Dumpster?

18:33.513 --> 18:36.581
You can read; that
gets you a diploma,
not a deal.

18:36.583 --> 18:41.886
How about a frozen pie?

18:41.888 --> 18:46.657
Newspapers say anything
about a<i> freezer?</i>

18:50.430 --> 18:52.263
I got two years yet.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.265
I want to be out
by my wedding anniversary.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.200
That's next week.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.502
If you have
the right information,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.837
your sentence might get reduced
to time served.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.872
Write me a ticket.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.590
Oh, ho-ho-hold.

19:02.591 --> 19:04.307
Before anything
gets written on paper,

19:04.310 --> 19:05.643
you tell us
about that freezer.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.479
Paid hit.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.649
Lloyd kept calling him
"the frozen fat man."

19:11.651 --> 19:13.151
Paid by who?

19:13.153 --> 19:15.419
How did they
get rid of the body?

19:15.421 --> 19:16.921
Lloyd's brother-in-law.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.656
Stuck it in a freezer.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.657
Gabe Hunt.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.893
Sound familiar?

19:21.895 --> 19:24.228
Gabriel Hunt--
works at Mario's.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.263
The dishwasher.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.531
Yeah, Mario's.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.867
Where's my ticket?

19:29.869 --> 19:34.205
MAN:
Come on, crap from some con
you made a deal with.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.907
Mr. Hunt worked
at the restaurant.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.059
With 20 other people.

19:38.060 --> 19:40.210
You never know what
a grand jury's going to do.

19:40.213 --> 19:44.315
Hindering prosecution,
third degree.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.617
No, no. The D.A.
says hindering two,

19:46.619 --> 19:48.920
and the deal dies
if it turns out

19:48.922 --> 19:50.388
Mr. Hunt held back.

19:52.926 --> 19:56.194
Lloyd calls me and meets me
at the restaurant,

19:56.196 --> 19:58.196
a stiff in the backseat...

19:58.198 --> 20:00.331
why he got dead, I don't know.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.934
You pry open that bench
in the freezer?

20:02.936 --> 20:04.635
Lloyd had to ditch the guy
quick.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.270
You know, figured we'd go back.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.239
Two days later, Mario fires me.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.908
I figured, "What the hell?
Who will find him?"

20:10.910 --> 20:13.945
Must have done wonders
for the car upholstery.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.313
We cleaned it up,

20:15.315 --> 20:18.983
took it back to the dealer.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.352
Come up with a name.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.956
Big place, 12th Avenue.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.958
Eisenstein.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.962
Mr. Gary Wallace,
leasing here for years.

20:30.964 --> 20:33.098
Always Cadillacs?

20:33.099 --> 20:35.233
Cadillacs-- that's
the United States of America.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.234
Like Columbus.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.969
Columbus was Italian.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.404
Cadillac was French.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.641
Five years ago, October,

20:43.643 --> 20:46.244
Mr. Wallace returned a car,
and we sold it.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.446
Yes, I have the owner.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.514
I know the law.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.521
Why you have to dismantle
my car, constable?

20:57.523 --> 20:58.956
Answer me that, no!

20:58.958 --> 21:00.792
I'm sorry, Mr. Rowley.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.627
At the moment this car
is a crime scene, not a car.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.762
Lot of customers
won't travel gypsy cab.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.364
She's not a luxury model.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.599
She take my entire savings.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.734
I know that.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.417
The slugs from the body
match the slug from the car.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.685
Dried blood inside the seat.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.720
It's too old for DNA,
but it's a match

21:29.722 --> 21:32.290
on Foster's antigens,
proteins and enzymes.

21:32.292 --> 21:33.591
85% is the same.

21:33.593 --> 21:36.627
Inside the seat,
wool from the tuxedo

21:36.629 --> 21:38.329
and it's
a perfect match.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.315
And no motive.

21:40.316 --> 21:42.300
Come on, Paul, this case
is five years old.

21:42.302 --> 21:44.735
We make an arrest,
maybe we shake a motive loose.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.704
If Foster wasn't killed
in Wallace's car,

21:46.706 --> 21:49.407
somebody in the same tux
with the same gun was.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.575
You can't put Wallace
in the car.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.344
Hey, his alibi stinks.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.814
I don't know.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.815
It doesn't shake out,
we'll look imprudent.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.452
If we don't arrest,
we're gonna look worse.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.321
If that driver starts
talking about his car,

22:03.323 --> 22:06.057
somebody's gonna
add it up.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.861
Call Rikers.
Get Mr. Wallace a cell.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.608
Have we got a clerk here?

22:24.610 --> 22:27.345
Is he on break, or what?

22:27.347 --> 22:30.014
<i> The People v. Gary Wallace.</i>

22:30.016 --> 22:31.782
The charge is murder,
second degree.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.517
Is the defendant ready
to enter a plea?

22:33.519 --> 22:36.520
Your Honor, if it
pleases the court...

22:36.522 --> 22:38.923
Mr. Cobb,
you couldn't please this court

22:38.925 --> 22:40.991
if you danced an Irish jig
on your fingertips.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.727
Can we get a plea?

22:44.364 --> 22:45.863
Not guilty.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.732
Somebody talk to me about bail.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.134
Your Honor,
a five-year-old crime...

22:50.136 --> 22:51.902
My client is
a respected businessman.

22:51.904 --> 22:56.073
Whose car was used
in the crime, Counselor.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.409
Mr. Robinette?

22:58.410 --> 23:00.744
The people request 200,000,
Your Honor.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.746
All cash.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.947
Mr. Robinette,

23:02.949 --> 23:05.082
do you know me to be vindictive?

23:05.084 --> 23:10.020
Bond will be fine. 300,000.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.589
Where's my clerk?

23:11.591 --> 23:14.392
Five years
and a slug in a car seat.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.160
That's a murder case?

23:16.162 --> 23:18.729
It's grounds for an indictment.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.399
One plus one equals zero.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.068
No motive plus no witness
equals no case.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.972
Josh Foster was my friend.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.407
Friend?

23:29.409 --> 23:32.176
You told the detectives
you barely knew him.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.162
Get an indictment.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.147
I'll have it dismissed
before it's typed.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.886
(<i> sighs</i> )

23:41.888 --> 23:44.622
He's not going
to give us a motive.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.926
Somebody had to have
a motive.

23:48.928 --> 23:53.097
Leslie Hart lied to the cops,
and she has a record.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.132
Joshua was so innocent,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.701
you wanted to make sure he wore
his overcoat in the winter.

23:57.703 --> 24:00.638
He didn't wear it
when he was shot.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.008
I didn't see him that night.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.676
And Mr. Wallace?

24:05.678 --> 24:07.211
Gary wouldn't
kill Josh.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.914
It was that, uh... driver,
what's his name?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.683
He was, like,
out of a gangster movie.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.085
You know about gangsters?
Drug-dealing gangsters?

24:15.087 --> 24:18.122
I dealt drugs
because I was poor.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.691
The night Mr. Foster
disappeared,

24:20.693 --> 24:23.227
you told police
that you were in rehearsal.

24:23.229 --> 24:26.931
We can't find anyone
who saw you before 9:00.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.670
This Lloyd...
whatever his name is...

24:32.672 --> 24:35.206
he killed
the man I was going to marry

24:35.208 --> 24:37.875
and I didn't come here
to be accused.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.183
You should have held off
on the arrest, my friend.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.785
Getting us where?

24:47.787 --> 24:50.054
The case was high-profile
before we touched it.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.689
You have an old crime.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.023
You have no motive.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.142
What do you mean, no motive?

24:55.143 --> 24:57.260
A lot of money floating around
before Foster died.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.880
I go looking for motives,

24:58.881 --> 25:00.498
I find the old standbys--
ambition and greed.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.099
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.902
you'll need something a little
more specific for a jury.

25:04.904 --> 25:08.172
You know, I had a call this
morning from Bart Sharman,

25:08.174 --> 25:09.740
Producer's Alliance.

25:09.742 --> 25:12.176
He says that Wallace
isn't respected,

25:12.178 --> 25:13.944
but nobody thinks
he's a murderer.

25:13.946 --> 25:16.747
What is this,
a trial-by-popularity poll?

25:16.749 --> 25:18.182
I don't know who gave the order,

25:18.184 --> 25:20.050
but Hart and Wallace were there.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.219
One of them ordered
that driver to kill Foster.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.221
I'd bet my shoes on it.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.789
Hart may be
a candidate,

25:25.791 --> 25:28.959
but the hit man
was Wallace's chauffeur.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.895
What kind of record did<i> he</i> have?

25:30.897 --> 25:33.998
His yellow sheet
started in the womb.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.233
Does somebody want to tell me

25:36.235 --> 25:39.703
how an ex-con keeps
a chauffeur's license?

25:39.705 --> 25:40.938
Thanks.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.274
Six months
before Foster disappeared,

25:43.276 --> 25:47.845
the driver had a hearing--
Taxi/Limousine Licensing Board.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.013
He lost his license.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.147
And got it back.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.782
Character testimony.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.150
Gary Wallace?

25:53.152 --> 25:55.185
And Leslie Hart.

25:55.187 --> 25:59.089
God bless her, she kept calling
him "what's his name."

25:59.091 --> 26:02.259
Couldn't remember him
but testified for him.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.795
Third character witness:

26:04.797 --> 26:07.064
Hyland, the songwriter.

26:07.066 --> 26:10.301
Well, Hart and Wallace,
we'll never break them,

26:10.303 --> 26:12.836
but Hyland,
we may have a shot.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.573
Leslie asked me to do it.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.908
Danner seemed perfectly nice.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.076
A violent ex-con?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.912
Manners out of Amy Vanderbilt,
I'm sure.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.049
I didn't know about his record.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.818
It was a character hearing,
not a meeting of his fan club.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.355
You have to understand,

26:31.357 --> 26:33.991
Leslie...

26:33.993 --> 26:38.262
she's... persuasive.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.164
What did she
persuade Foster of?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.907
I will call you as a witness.

26:49.909 --> 26:53.277
I'll ask you, "Why did you
testify for Danner?"

26:53.279 --> 26:56.113
If I find one iota of evidence,

26:56.115 --> 27:00.384
you'll find yourself indicted
as a co-conspirator.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.996
The afternoon
before Josh disappeared,

27:11.998 --> 27:15.299
he asked me if Leslie
was cheating on him

27:15.301 --> 27:16.967
with Gary Wallace.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.304
Wearing tuxedos
all the time,

27:20.306 --> 27:23.007
hanging on Leslie,
he was so pathetic.

27:23.009 --> 27:27.177
He said if Leslie was using him,
he wouldn't go through with it.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.179
Go through with what?

27:29.181 --> 27:31.148
He wouldn't raise more money.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.201
He'd let the show die.

27:34.202 --> 27:37.253
She cheats on him, and he's
ready to toss away $7 million?

27:37.256 --> 27:42.860
All I know is,
they're out of money,

27:42.862 --> 27:47.665
Josh disappears,
and then everything's fine.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.346
Foster disappeared,
and the problems went with him.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.381
If we can find out
where Hart and Wallace
got the money,

28:04.383 --> 28:06.016
we may have a motive.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.951
Ben and I've checked
the bank records--

28:07.953 --> 28:10.387
Hart, Foster, Wallace,
the partnership.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.022
Which partnership?

28:12.024 --> 28:14.291
The musical--
the general partners.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.260
Find out if there's
a separate account

28:16.262 --> 28:19.463
for the limited partners,
Foster and Wallace.

28:24.336 --> 28:26.303
Two checks,
$500,000 each

28:26.305 --> 28:28.172
from different
holding companies

28:28.174 --> 28:30.307
deposited to
the partnership account

28:30.309 --> 28:33.310
in Hart's name two days
after Foster disappeared.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.045
Who controls the companies?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.480
Cocaine dealer
named Ketchum.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.182
Now he's into heroin.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.184
Cocaine... Ketchum...

28:40.186 --> 28:42.386
Leslie Hart's drug bust
eight years ago.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.321
Ketchum was busted
with her.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.255
The money she invested
in the show-- $1 million--

28:46.258 --> 28:47.291
he did a deal
with her, right?

28:47.293 --> 28:49.126
He's done well
for himself.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.494
Townhouse on East 83rd.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.330
Guess who else he was
in business with.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.498
The dead chauffeur--

28:54.500 --> 28:56.366
Danner.

28:56.368 --> 28:59.336
Let's find out
who his lawyer is.

29:00.306 --> 29:03.407
This is a discussion
of his finances?

29:03.409 --> 29:06.076
Your client
has the wrong friends.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.912
Josh Foster's murder?

29:08.914 --> 29:10.214
Oh, please.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.382
Mr. Ketchum was
in the drug business

29:12.384 --> 29:14.218
with the hit man.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.153
I didn't serve a day.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.287
Neither did
Mr. Foster's girlfriend.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.156
ROBINETTTE:
Leslie?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.024
I lent her some money.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.426
There's no record
she paid you back.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.161
I'm generous.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.329
What have you got?

29:25.331 --> 29:27.181
Loose threads.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.032
Which we'll turn into a rope
to hang your client.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.502
The<i> Bleak House</i> money,
your client's checks,

29:31.504 --> 29:34.071
the money was invested
in Leslie Hart's name.

29:34.073 --> 29:37.191
That's a title 18 felony.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.310
You have nothing--
lending money isn't a crime.

29:40.312 --> 29:42.346
Neither is having
the wrong friends.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.349
Next time you want to make
my life unpleasant,

29:45.351 --> 29:47.117
do it over the phone.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.054
I said title 18 felony--
he didn't blink.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.790
Why's that?
That's what
I asked myself.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.324
A clear securities
violation.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.325
He's not worried?

29:55.327 --> 29:56.460
There's only
one answer.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.328
Bigger problems
on his mind.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.430
He's already under
federal indictment.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.466
Racketeering, drugs,
extortion.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.002
He gets convicted of that,
he's up for 30 years.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.037
If I'm about to hear
what I think...

30:07.039 --> 30:08.505
Call the U.S.
Attorney's office,
Herb McCann.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.141
Forget it.
They're not doing us any favors.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.377
Adam, please, this woman
uses people like Kleenex.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.444
I don't want her
to walk.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.280
Get McCann
to help us.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.351
Oh, I tell you...

30:23.489 --> 30:26.323
McCANN:
<i> Elliot Ketchum?</i>

30:26.325 --> 30:28.492
He gets a deal
over my dead body.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.495
We have a dead body,
with three holes in it.

30:31.497 --> 30:35.332
Ten months. 2,000 man-hours
into Mr. Ketchum.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.368
I make a deal with him,
my staff guys will revolt.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.336
I have
a five-year-old case,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.171
doesn't break without him.

30:41.173 --> 30:42.606
What's in it for me?

30:42.608 --> 30:45.175
One less defendant to convict.

30:48.380 --> 30:52.049
You want to use Mr. Ketchum,
here's the plea:

30:52.051 --> 30:54.551
he testifies against
his co-conspirators--

30:54.553 --> 30:57.554
three federal counts,
three years on each count.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.289
Nine years?

30:59.291 --> 31:00.858
What are you, his lawyer?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.559
I'm not bargaining here.
Nine years.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.095
Ketchum will never go for that.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.397
Yeah, that's your problem.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.867
You want to make a deal?

31:09.869 --> 31:13.403
I'll testify for you.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.405
The Feds drop everything.

31:15.407 --> 31:19.076
Where are you planning
to retire, Mr. Ketchum?

31:19.078 --> 31:21.411
I'm too young to think about it.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.280
Think about Kansas.

31:23.282 --> 31:27.084
The Feds add title 18
to your indictment,

31:27.086 --> 31:28.485
your golden years
will be in Leavenworth.

31:31.891 --> 31:34.424
Suppose the Feds
will take a plea.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.593
Suppose you already
talked to them.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.395
Suppose I did.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.531
You testify against
your co-conspirators,

31:41.533 --> 31:44.268
three counts,
six years each count.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.371
Eighteen years?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.543
Mr. Ketchum will take
his chances at trial.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.079
You want to get back to us...?

31:56.081 --> 31:58.348
STONE:
Make an offer.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.684
You give us immunity
on this case

32:00.686 --> 32:04.187
on the three federal counts,
three years each.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.389
Nine years total.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.325
Nine years?

32:08.327 --> 32:09.559
It's hard to imagine

32:09.561 --> 32:11.528
the U.S. Attorney
will settle for that.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.465
Well, it's hard to imagine
my client will help you

32:15.467 --> 32:16.566
if they don't.

32:16.568 --> 32:18.468
Make your call.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.409
How long should
this imaginary call take?

32:29.581 --> 32:32.582
Let 'em stew.

32:32.584 --> 32:35.652
Ten, 15 minutes
should do the trick.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.635
Nine years.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.571
You cooperate, it's a done deal.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.409
Lloyd Danner calls me,

32:59.411 --> 33:01.745
says Leslie wants
to move 70-80 pounds of coke.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.380
She tell you why?

33:03.382 --> 33:05.349
She wants to buy into this show.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.751
Get this fat man Foster
off her back.

33:07.753 --> 33:09.987
Says if she owns
a piece of it,

33:09.989 --> 33:13.590
she can get rid of him.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.529
Call Cerreta and Logan.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.468
You know, there's
a lesson in this.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.570
Never fall in love
with an actress.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.405
Rex Harrison said it.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.273
They never stop acting.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.577
Miss Hart?

33:33.579 --> 33:36.213
Leslie Hart,
you're under arrest

33:36.215 --> 33:38.648
for the murder
of Joshua Foster.

33:38.650 --> 33:41.351
Is this some kind of a joke?

33:41.353 --> 33:43.020
A sketch
for your new show.

33:43.022 --> 33:45.222
Will you put
some cuffs on her
and get her in the car?

33:45.224 --> 33:47.724
Hands behind
your back,
please.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.610
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:49.611 --> 33:51.495
Anything you say can
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.136
we sold some drugs together.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.271
Now, on this occasion,
five years ago,

34:01.273 --> 34:03.473
when Miss Hart asked you
to purchase cocaine,

34:03.475 --> 34:04.508
did she tell you why?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.376
Objection. Calls for hearsay.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.377
Overruled.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.146
Utterance in furtherance

34:09.148 --> 34:10.213
of the conspiracy.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.282
JUDGE:
Mr. Ketchum?

34:12.284 --> 34:14.418
KETCHAM:
some people had fronted her
some coke.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.454
She wanted some of her own money
in the show,

34:17.456 --> 34:20.190
Otherwise, she'd have
to marry this fat slob
to get anything.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.292
When the narcotics
were delivered,

34:22.294 --> 34:24.194
did Mr. Foster say anything
to you?

34:24.196 --> 34:26.663
KETCHAM:
He was nervous, shaking.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.133
I think, "This jerk doesn't know
cocaine from shoe polish."

34:30.135 --> 34:33.336
He's watching Leslie unload the
trunk, and he says real loud,

34:33.338 --> 34:34.471
"She's beautiful, isn't she?

34:34.473 --> 34:37.140
"But if she did anything
to hurt me,

34:37.142 --> 34:38.608
I'd call the cops on her."

34:38.610 --> 34:41.411
Did Miss Hart hear what he said?

34:41.413 --> 34:45.315
She heard, and she
didn't like it at all.

34:45.317 --> 34:47.684
Mr. Ketcham,
did you recommend

34:47.686 --> 34:50.320
that Miss Hart hire
Mr. Danner as a driver?

34:50.322 --> 34:52.522
She wanted muscle.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.324
She said you never knew
it might come in handy.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.327
Thank you.
No further questions.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.730
Who paid Mr. Danner's salary?

35:00.732 --> 35:04.334
As far as I know, uh...
Wallace.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.603
HANLEY:
So Miss Hart
never hired him?

35:06.605 --> 35:09.239
No, not really. No.

35:10.509 --> 35:13.276
Mr. Ketchum,
this federal indictment--

35:13.278 --> 35:14.578
in your plea bargain,

35:14.580 --> 35:17.314
you agreed to how many years
in prison?

35:17.316 --> 35:19.216
Nine years.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.218
What was the maximum sentence?

35:21.220 --> 35:26.156
30 years, give or take.

35:26.158 --> 35:27.724
You saved yourself 21 years.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.426
Is that an inducement
to tell the truth?

35:29.428 --> 35:31.194
Objection!

35:31.196 --> 35:32.362
Withdrawn.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.597
I have no questions
with this witness.

35:36.235 --> 35:41.238
Have you ever seen the defendant
Gary Wallace before today?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.606
About a year ago.

35:42.608 --> 35:45.342
The visitor's room in Dannemora.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.344
He came to see Lloyd.

35:47.346 --> 35:49.212
What was Mr. Danner's mood
after the visit?

35:49.214 --> 35:51.348
POLLARD:
Lloyd went nuts.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.416
He said they knew
he was up for parole

35:53.418 --> 35:56.520
and they were talking about
that he'd better watch his back

35:56.522 --> 35:59.689
and not talk about the fat man
if he got out.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.625
Thank you.
No further questions.

36:08.534 --> 36:14.671
Mr. Pollard, what crime did you
commit that put you behind bars?

36:14.673 --> 36:15.805
Dope dealing.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.175
Is that all?

36:18.177 --> 36:20.277
Was there an assault conviction

36:20.279 --> 36:22.746
for beating up
a 56-year-old woman?

36:24.316 --> 36:26.283
That was my sister-in-law.

36:26.285 --> 36:31.688
Well, that certainly
makes it acceptable.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.558
No further questions.

36:34.560 --> 36:37.327
I waited for Josh
to show up.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.563
He said that they'd be there
with a new investor.

36:39.565 --> 36:41.198
STONE:
At this rehearsal,

36:41.200 --> 36:44.701
were either Mr. Wallace
or Miss Hart present?

36:44.703 --> 36:47.771
Mr. Wallace, he said that
he would be there about 8:00.

36:47.773 --> 36:52.509
He got there about 9:30,
and Leslie showed up

36:52.511 --> 36:54.394
half an hour later.

36:54.395 --> 36:56.278
Now, this conversation
with Mr. Foster--

36:56.281 --> 36:58.381
when you told him that
Mr. Wallace and Miss Hart

36:58.383 --> 37:00.283
were not romantically involved,

37:00.285 --> 37:01.518
did he say anything?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.587
He said he thought
I was lying.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.255
Thank you.

37:05.257 --> 37:09.259
Mr. Hyland, were you ever
romantically involved

37:09.261 --> 37:11.328
with Leslie Hart?

37:11.330 --> 37:14.564
We... um...

37:14.566 --> 37:16.466
briefly, in college.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.768
HANLEY:
Did you ask Miss Hart
to marry you?

37:18.770 --> 37:22.606
Yes, I did, but...

37:22.608 --> 37:24.708
Were you jealous
of her other relationships?

37:24.710 --> 37:26.610
Did you speak
of your jealousy

37:26.612 --> 37:28.445
in front of other people?

37:28.447 --> 37:31.881
Are you testifying today
out of anger?

37:31.883 --> 37:33.850
No, I... no, no, no...

37:33.852 --> 37:35.752
I... I was over her.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.321
Thank you. No more questions.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.889
SCHIFF:
<i> A spurned lover.</i>

37:39.891 --> 37:41.258
Wonderful.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.292
He didn't tell us.

37:42.294 --> 37:43.827
And two dope dealers--
better.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.529
This isn't the style page
of the<i> New York Times, Adam.</i>

37:46.531 --> 37:48.598
Scummy case,
you get scummy witnesses.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.499
Right.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.268
What if I offer Hart man two?

37:51.270 --> 37:52.736
Offer whatever you want.

37:52.738 --> 37:56.306
Dinner in the Rainbow Room,
round-trip ticket to Paris.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.842
If I were her,
I'd wait for the jury.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.344
Hart rolls,
Wallace takes aplea,

38:01.346 --> 38:02.345
we all go home.

38:02.347 --> 38:03.346
Yeah, maybe not.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.515
If you don't put Wallace or Hart

38:05.517 --> 38:06.916
next to the gun,

38:06.918 --> 38:09.886
forget a conviction.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.788
Conspiracy two.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.689
She testifies Wallace
paid the driver to kill Foster.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.325
Miss Hart,
I must be dumb.

38:15.327 --> 38:16.593
You dealt the drugs

38:16.595 --> 38:19.529
you got the money,
but Wallace gave the order?

38:19.531 --> 38:21.931
It was Gary's idea.

38:21.933 --> 38:24.334
I loved Josh.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.003
I was a kid,
for God's sake.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.671
You love him,
but you didn't call the police.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.706
I was afraid they'd kill me,
too.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.741
Danner was afraid
you'd kill him.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.543
You're afraid
he'd kill you.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.578
I think you're confusing
fear with greed.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.913
Manslaughter one.

38:36.915 --> 38:41.551
Mr. Wallace smells bad
to that jury, not my client.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.420
Conspiracy one.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.655
Maybe Wallace
has a better story.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.558
Whose story
the jury going to believe?

38:48.560 --> 38:50.927
Mine.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.930
One ex-con, okay?

38:53.932 --> 38:56.800
I underestimated
how bad two would look.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.435
Hyland didn't help.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.703
"I loved Josh."

38:59.705 --> 39:01.404
"I was just a kid."

39:01.406 --> 39:03.506
She's a better actress than
she gives herself credit for.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.408
Without someone
who saw Wallace or Hart

39:05.410 --> 39:06.710
in the car
with the body...

39:06.712 --> 39:09.579
We could call a medium.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.881
The driver can testify
from the grave.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.987
Maybe he can.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.357
Danner was paid for the hit.

39:20.359 --> 39:22.959
His brother-in-law
put Foster in a freezer.

39:22.961 --> 39:23.860
So?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.395
Brother-in-law Hunt.

39:25.397 --> 39:27.564
Doesn't he ask
for a piece of the action?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.868
If Hunt was paid
and lied to us...

39:31.870 --> 39:34.471
You think he's stupid enough

39:34.473 --> 39:37.607
to leave a trail?

39:37.609 --> 39:41.511
An intellectual giant he's not.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.012
This man cooperated.

39:43.014 --> 39:44.981
We had a deal.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.884
If you tell the truth.
You never told us
they paid you.

39:47.886 --> 39:48.885
How do you know?

39:48.887 --> 39:49.886
Shut up.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.489
Mr. Hunt...

39:52.491 --> 39:55.392
you knew about the hit
in advance--

39:55.394 --> 39:58.495
that makes you
an accessory
to murder.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.796
Paul?

39:59.798 --> 40:03.433
Two days
after Foster disappeared,

40:03.435 --> 40:06.870
Mr. Hunt deposited $10,000
in his checking account.

40:06.872 --> 40:09.389
Lucky at Belmont?

40:09.390 --> 40:11.907
HEALY:
You can't prove where
that ten grand came from.

40:11.910 --> 40:15.512
If I have to find everyone
he so much has had coffee with

40:15.514 --> 40:16.780
in the past five years,
I will

40:16.782 --> 40:19.616
and I won't be in the mood
to take a plea.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.520
I wasn't there
when they killed him.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.654
That's enough.

40:24.656 --> 40:27.023
Accessory to man two.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.595
He enters the plea
<i> after</i> he testifies.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.665
You could get the testimony
and change the plea.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.636
You have to trust me
on this one.

40:39.638 --> 40:45.008
Lloyd and me put the body
in a Dumpster in the alley.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.544
What did you tell
Mr. Danner?

40:47.546 --> 40:50.680
I said, "Come back 2:00
in the morning."

40:50.682 --> 40:52.682
We'll stow it in the freezer."

40:52.684 --> 40:54.717
Was anyone else in the car?

40:54.719 --> 40:57.654
Well, this guy came out,
didn't say anything

40:57.656 --> 40:59.823
ran and flagged a cab.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.724
Is that man in
the courtroom today?

41:03.695 --> 41:04.727
He's sitting over there.

41:04.729 --> 41:06.963
Let the record show

41:06.965 --> 41:09.999
that the witness is pointing
at the defendant, Mr. Wallace.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.701
Let the record so indicate.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.503
Thank you.

41:15.106 --> 41:19.909
Mr. Hunt, have you pled guilty
to a felony in exchange

41:19.911 --> 41:23.880
for lenient treatment
and your testimony today?

41:23.882 --> 41:26.716
No.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.853
Wait a minute.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.488
I have the record.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.656
Your Honor, may we approach?

41:39.931 --> 41:42.031
A copy of the plea
as entered.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.666
Vacated yesterday.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.735
And you have
a new one
in place?

41:45.737 --> 41:46.936
No, I don't.

41:46.938 --> 41:50.607
Are you going to let him
get away with this?

41:50.609 --> 41:51.975
With what, Mr. Cobb?

41:51.977 --> 41:54.577
If there is no guilty plea
in place,

41:54.579 --> 41:56.846
the witness answered truthfully.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.684
No further questions.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.023
Mr. Hunt, you testified

42:07.025 --> 42:09.626
you saw Mr. Wallace
leave the alley.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.794
Did you also see Leslie Hart?

42:11.796 --> 42:13.596
No.

42:13.598 --> 42:15.765
Have you ever seen her
before today?

42:15.767 --> 42:17.800
No.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.169
Thank you.
No more questions.

42:20.171 --> 42:23.039
It's a good story.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.841
That's the truth.

42:31.182 --> 42:34.784
Criminally negligent homicide,
six months.

42:34.786 --> 42:35.919
STONE:
Negligent?

42:35.921 --> 42:37.053
He left a loaded gun

42:37.055 --> 42:38.922
that went off by itself?

42:38.924 --> 42:40.857
Manslaughter one, six years.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.928
Manslaughter two,
two years.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.597
Mr. Wallace,
you knew she killed him.

42:47.599 --> 42:48.865
You did nothing.

42:48.867 --> 42:51.601
Accessory to man one--
still six years.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.102
Take it or leave it.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.909
That lunatic bitch.

42:59.911 --> 43:03.713
I should never
have gotten in the car.

43:06.151 --> 43:08.184
WALLACE:
<i> Well, we left the drugs</i>

43:08.186 --> 43:12.655
and started driving back
to the theater.

43:12.657 --> 43:14.657
STONE:
And then what happened?

43:14.659 --> 43:17.126
WALLACE:
And Josh looked at me
and Leslie.

43:17.128 --> 43:20.797
He said, uh...

43:20.799 --> 43:22.799
"You two think I'm stupid."

43:22.801 --> 43:27.837
And he...
called Leslie a whore

43:27.839 --> 43:31.975
and said he was going
to call the cops

43:31.977 --> 43:33.109
and tell them he knew
where the...

43:33.111 --> 43:35.712
where the money came from.

43:35.714 --> 43:39.115
And how did Miss Hart respond?

43:39.117 --> 43:43.119
She told Lloyd to stop the car.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.888
And what did
Mr. Foster do?

43:45.890 --> 43:47.223
Tried to get out.

43:47.225 --> 43:52.128
Lloyd locked the door
from the front

43:52.130 --> 43:55.898
and Leslie said, uh...

43:55.900 --> 43:58.001
"Do it now."

43:58.003 --> 44:03.006
And Lloyd shot him
in the chest.

44:03.008 --> 44:04.007
Once?

44:04.009 --> 44:05.808
Well, Leslie said,

44:05.810 --> 44:07.110
"He's still breathing.

44:09.848 --> 44:11.681
Shoot him again."

44:11.683 --> 44:13.683
And Lloyd...

44:13.685 --> 44:16.152
bent over,
shot him in the head...

44:16.154 --> 44:18.221
twice.

44:21.159 --> 44:24.160
I begged Gary not to do it.

44:24.162 --> 44:28.031
He told me if I said anything,

44:28.033 --> 44:30.733
he'd have me killed, too.

44:30.735 --> 44:35.772
Did you tell Lloyd Danner
to kill Joshua Foster?

44:35.774 --> 44:36.939
No. No, I didn't.

44:36.941 --> 44:39.075
I was in love with him.

44:39.077 --> 44:40.309
No more questions.

44:43.048 --> 44:45.014
Miss Hart...

44:45.016 --> 44:47.183
you testified
that you didn't know

44:47.185 --> 44:49.686
Mr. Wallace's driver well.

44:49.688 --> 44:50.687
Is that correct?

44:50.689 --> 44:52.055
That is correct.

44:52.057 --> 44:56.159
That you had no personal
relationship with him?

44:56.161 --> 44:59.929
He was Gary's driver, not mine.

44:59.931 --> 45:03.199
No further questions.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.134
Anything more, counselor?

45:05.136 --> 45:06.135
No redirect.

45:06.137 --> 45:08.071
The defense rests, Your Honor.

45:08.073 --> 45:11.007
Permission to call
a rebuttal witness, Your Honor?

45:12.210 --> 45:14.877
The Taxi and Limousine
Licensing Board

45:14.879 --> 45:16.212
always holds a hearing.

45:16.214 --> 45:18.214
If you're convicted of a felony

45:18.216 --> 45:21.150
you can't keep
a vehicle-for-hire license.

45:21.152 --> 45:22.752
Miss Radley,
did you secure a recording

45:22.754 --> 45:25.822
of Mr. Danner's hearing
for the district attorney?

45:25.824 --> 45:27.056
Yes, I did.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.858
Your Honor,
People's exhibit #31.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.126
Permission to play the tape?

45:30.128 --> 45:31.728
Objection.

45:31.730 --> 45:32.962
Sidebar, please.

45:38.236 --> 45:40.236
The prosecution
held that tape back.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.239
We asked for all such records
under discovery.

45:43.241 --> 45:47.043
We never had any of them
in our possession.

45:47.045 --> 45:49.779
We made no copies
of the transcript
or the recording.

45:49.781 --> 45:53.149
He's right, Miss Hanley.

45:53.151 --> 45:56.786
This is a badly drafted
discovery motion.

45:56.788 --> 45:57.787
Overruled.

45:57.789 --> 45:59.822
You may play the tape.

46:06.798 --> 46:09.298
LESLIE (<i> on tape</i> ):
I've known Mr. Danner
for more than a year.

46:09.300 --> 46:11.167
He's a close friend.

46:11.169 --> 46:14.203
RADLEY:
Do you wish to make a statement
concerning his character?

46:14.205 --> 46:15.738
LESLIE:
Despite his record,

46:15.739 --> 46:17.272
I believe Lloyd to be reliable
and conscientious.

46:17.275 --> 46:20.176
I'd trust him with my life.

46:26.050 --> 46:28.217
No further questions,
Your Honor.

46:28.219 --> 46:30.052
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

46:30.054 --> 46:32.221
Leslie Hart's
filing an appeal

46:32.223 --> 46:34.223
based on the withheld tape.

46:34.225 --> 46:35.925
She'll lose.

46:35.927 --> 46:39.162
Three lovers,
none of whom she loved.

46:39.164 --> 46:41.063
And they didn't
even exist for her.

46:41.065 --> 46:42.799
No one's real to her.

46:42.801 --> 46:44.200
We're all actors in her play.

46:44.202 --> 46:46.035
Foster didn't die.

46:46.037 --> 46:48.605
He just left the stage.
