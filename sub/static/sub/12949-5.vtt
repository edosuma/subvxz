TILL THE WAR IS WON

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000

DAMN, THAT IS SEXY.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000

UM, ONLY THE HOTTEST
UP-AND-COMING R&B STAR!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
TO DO IS GET SOME CLOTHES ON.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
NOT TO SHOW IT, OUR MONEY
PROBLEMS HAD CLEARLY MADE

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
HERE IS WHERE ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN, WAR

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
GRANDDAD A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
SEGREGATION WAS IN THE DEEP
SOUTH.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
YOU'VE HEARD OF HIS SONGS --
"TITTY TELETHON"?

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
HERO AND CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND, DECIDED TO SPEND HIS FINAL

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Granddad: SEGREGATION WAS SO
BAD BACK THEN, MY RULE WAS IF IT

Granddad: HUEY, RILEY, IS
THAT ELECTRICITY I HEAR?!

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
"PLEASURE ME ORALLY"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
"DON'T TOUCH MY ANUS, GIRL"?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
DAYS.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
ALL RIGHT, THINK.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
HOW WOULD I HAVE HEARD THIS?

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT AS PLANNED.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
WE GOT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
WAS IN THE SOUTH, IT WASN'T
WORTH IT.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD,
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
WHAT'D I TELL YOU?

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
AND MOST OF MY FAMILY WAS IN THE
SOUTH, AND I DIDN'T CARE.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
THIS HOUSE IS AN AIRPLANE.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
ALL DAY LONG ON THE RADIO,
THAT'S ALL I HEAR, EVEN ON THE

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Granddad: BOYS!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
>> Huey: WE GO HOME. THIS WAY.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
TURN OFF ALL YOUR ELECTRONIC
DEVICES AND KEEP THEM OFF.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Huey: WE'RE RIGHT HERE,
GRANDDAD.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
THEY WERE NOT WORTH IT.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
WHITE STATIONS.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
>> Granddad: WHAT HOME?

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
SO, IT'S WITH THAT BACKDROP
THAT A HANDFUL OF US DECIDED TO

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Granddad: IMPORTANT FAMILY
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
MATTER OF FACT, GET OUT HERE!

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
WE HAVE NO HOME.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE ARE LEAVING WOODCREST
FOREVER.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
WE HAVE NO FUTURE.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
YOU SHOULD BE DONE TRYING ON
THOSE CLOTHES.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
OUR LIVES HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE
DISASTER SINCE WE MOVED HERE.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
WE HAVE NOTHING!

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
VENTURE INTO THE DEEP SOUTH TO
DEFY THOSE IMMORAL LAWS.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
EH, IT'S NOT MY THING, BUT
IT'S WHAT PASSES FOR R&B NOW,

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Riley: I CAN'T WEAR THIS.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
ALL RIGHT?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Riley: TRUE THAT. TRUE THAT.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Granddad: WHY NOT?

00:59.000 --> 00:59.000
WHAT CAN I SAY?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Huey: NOW, THAT'S TRUE,
GRANDDAD.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
DON'T TELL ANYONE IT'S FROM THE
THRIFT STORE.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
ROBERT JEBEDIAH FREEMAN IS A
VERY ODD RECURRING CHARACTER IN

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
I GOT TEENAGE DAUGHTERS.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Granddad: WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
HAVE SAFE, BORING LIVES.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
THEY'RE INTO BLACK GUYS, SO THIS
IS WHAT I GOT TO HEAR.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
THEY WOULDN'T KNOW.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
LOOKS STYLISH TO ME.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD
DAYS WHEN BLACK SINGERS WOULD

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
I WAS SUPPOSED TO FIND SOME HOT,
FINANCIALLY DESPERATE OR

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
TELL HIM, HUEY.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Huey: IT'S NOT STYLISH.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
HE IS A SELF-DESCRIBED
CIVIL RIGHTS LEGEND, WHICH I

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Granddad: IF KRIS KROSS CAN
JUMP IN THEM, YOU CAN WALK TO

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
DRESS IN HIGH-HEEL BOOTS OR BURN
HOOKERS WITH CRACK PIPES?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED MAMA AND
SETTLE DOWN.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
FEEL IS, WELL, NOT AT ALL
ACCURATE.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
BUT NOTHING WORKED OUT AS
PLANNED.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
SCHOOL IN THEM.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
YOU'RE SHOWING YOUR AGE, MY
FRIEND.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Riley: FOR REAL, GRANDDAD?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
FLIZZY'S IN TOWN, DOING A SHOW

STUPID, BIZARRE EPISODE AFTER

EVEN BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, HIS
PARTICIPATION IN THE

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
SEE, THIS IS WHY NIGGERS DROP
OUT OF SCHOOL.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000

COMPLETELY AGAINST HIS WILL.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I WAS HOPING TO GO.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE JUST
BEATING HIM TO TAKE OUT YOUR OWN

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Riley: WELL, I SAY IT'S ABOUT
TIME!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
END OF THE ROAD FOR ME.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
FRUSTRATIONS.

CYCLE OF DESPAIR, VIOLENCE, AND

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Granddad: DAMN, DAMN, DAMN.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.000
TO START THINKING LIKE WHITE

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT
THAT, PORCH MONKEY?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
PEOPLE -- ALL OF US.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T GET A JOB.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
JUST DOING A CHEMISTRY PROJECT

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
FAULT.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I BET IT'S CLEANER THAN THAT

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FROM
SOUTH AMERICAN DEATH SQUADS.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
AND NOT MAKING NO BOMBS?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Ruckus: THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS.

02:50.000 --> 02:50.000
>> Huey: YES, GRANDDAD.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
HE GOT ELECTED AND MADE GOOD
WHITE FOLKS FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
SHOOT, IF IT WAS UP TO ME, YOU'D
BE  FROM A TREE OUTSIDE.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
I SWEAR.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
I MAKE NO EXCUSES, OTHER THAN IT
WAS A REALLY GOOD DEAL AND THEY

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'M NOT MAKING A BOMB.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
UNDER

NOW, SCRAM,
SPEARCHUCKER.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
ABOUT HIRING NIGGERS.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
WERE THROWING IN A LOT OF FREE
AMMUNITION.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
THAT PINK STUFF RIGHT THERE?

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
SEE, A SHOESHINE BOY IS SOMEBODY
YOU SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME, SIR, BUT
I KNOW MY RIGHTS -- SEPARATE BUT

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
SIX MONTHS AGO, FLIZZY WAS
ARRESTED FOR FIGHTING IN THE

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
ISN'T THAT WHAT TERRORISTS PUT

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000

TALKING TO ABOUT ANYTHING --
ABOUT YOUR MISTRESS, ABOUT HOW

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
NOW, I DON'T MIND USING THE
COLORED BATHROOM, BUT IT IS A

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
V.I.P. SECTION OF A NIGHTCLUB
WITH NICKI MINAJ.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
PUT A MATCH UP THEIR BOOTY HOLE

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
VIOLATION OF MY CIVIL RIGHTS IF
THAT BATHROOM IS COVERED IN

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
TO BLOW UP THE WHOLE PLANE?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
YOU'D BETTER NOT BE MAKING NO

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
YOUR WIFE --
SOMEBODY YOU SHOULD FEEL

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
I'D JUST LIKE TO APOLOGIZE TO
ALL MY FANS, FOR FIGHTING IN THE

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
BOOTY-HOLE BOMBS AROUND HERE.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
THE BATHROOMS SHOULD BE EQUALLY

03:05.000 --> 03:05.000
>> Huey: IT'S NOT A BOMB,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
GRANDDAD.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
COMFORTABLE CALLING A NIGGER,

HEY, HOW ABOUT I GET YOU A
MOP, AND YOU CLEAN IT, JIGABOO?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT GOING

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
GET THEM FRIENDLY GREETINGS OUT
AT WORK.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
IN MY DEFENSE, I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A ROBOT SENT FROM THE FUTURE TO

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
WITH THE BILLY DEE LOOK.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK UP ONE
DAY AND SEE THAT SHOESHINE BOY

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
SO, I BRAVELY WENT INTO THE

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
PROTEST AT THE VENUE TODAY.

DON'T HOLD BACK.

03:18.000 --> 03:18.000

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
THAT JUST COMPLICATES THE
RELATIONSHIP.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
OH, NOT JUST ANY DUMP.

CONTRACTS?!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000

A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO...

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Granddad: DEAD.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.000
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Tom: SARAH, PLEASE CALM DOWN!

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
A NEW FACE IN THE REPUBLICAN
CAMPAIGN RACE -- FROM SEEMINGLY

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
WHAT? I'M OLD.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
I SAID I APOLOGIZE!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
SOMETIMES WHEN I SNEEZE, I
MYSELF.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
OUT OF NOWHERE, A
MR. UNCLE RUCKUS.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Sarah: THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
ROBERT FREEMAN -- WHEN HE GOT ON
THE BUS.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
LOOK AT THAT.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
ONCE --
MOVING ON.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.000
Tom: DOING WHAT?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Sarah: APOLOGIZING!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
FINANCED BY BILLIONAIRE
BANKING TYCOONS AND MR. BURNS

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
OH, HOW THE HIGH YELLOW SHALL BE

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
Tom: YOU DON'T WANT ME TO
APOLOGIZE?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU PUT FOR
GREATEST WEAKNESS.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
KNOCK-OFF ED WUNCLER AND HIS
ECONOMY-CRUSHING SON, EDDIE JR.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
LAST, AND THE LAST SHALL BE HIGH

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
NOW, I REMEMBER SEEING HIM FOR
THE FIRST TIME AND THINKING,

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Sarah: NO, I DON'T!

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Granddad: PORK CHOPS.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Tom: OKAY, I'M SORRY I'M
APOLOGIZING.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
YELLOW.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
ARE YOU EVEN TAKING THIS
SERIOUSLY?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
>> Granddad: LEAVE ME ALONE,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
"OOH, HE'S REALLY FRAIL."

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
RUCKUS.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Granddad: ARE YOU?!

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Sarah: YOU DID IT AGAIN!

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
THIS MR. RUCKUS IS NOT -- I
REPEAT, NOT -- AN

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
I'M WORKING AS FAST AS I CAN.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
THESE RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Tom: SARAH, CALM DOWN!

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
>> Ruckus: AH, YEAH, NIGGA.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
IF YOU, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,
THINK I AM COMPLETELY UNHIRABLE,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
I'M SORRY.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
OH, THIS AIN'T NOTHING LIKE THE

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
I'M SORRY!

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN, BUT, RATHER, A
CAUCASIAN MAN SUFFERING FROM A

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I CAN'T STOP!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
MOVIE "CAR WASH," IS IT, NIGGA?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Granddad: I NOTICED SHE WAS
READING RALPH ELLISON'S

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
OH, NO. UNH-UNH. UNH-UNH.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
FINE.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Sarah: OH, I SWEAR TO GOD,
TOM, IF YOU APOLOGIZE AGAIN, YOU

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
UNH-UNH.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
MR. FREEMAN, THESE ARE
STANDARD JOB-PLACEMENT

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
"INVISIBLE MAN," A BOOK I HAD
MEANT TO READ MANY TIMES.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
RARE SKIN CONDITION CALLED
REVITILIGO.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
AIN'T NO SINGING, NO DANCING, NO

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
ARE OUT OF HERE!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
QUESTIONS.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
RICHARD PRYOR -- NOTHING.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
THEY'RE ON EVERYONE'S
APPLICATION.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
I'M SORRY ABOUT MY LANGUAGE.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
Tom: I'M --
MM.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
I JUST...I GET SO UPSET AT THE
INJUSTICE OF SEGREGATION.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
LIBERALS ARE, OF COURSE,
RIDICULING THIS MAN'S DISEASE,

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
OH, BY THE WAY, THAT LAZY

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
OKAY.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
MEXICAN SUMBITCH CHICO CANCELED,

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
LET ME BE FRANK -- YOU ARE
UNHIRABLE.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
THEN JUST TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
WHICH, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS
COMPLETELY REAL -- UNLIKE RAPE.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Sarah: THAT'S THE PROBLEM,
TOM!

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
AND I NEED YOU TO STAY TILL

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
IT'S OKAY.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
CLOSING TIME.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
YOU COME ACROSS AS UNEDUCATED,
YOU'VE JUST PROVEN YOU'RE

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT
TO DO!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
>> Granddad: BUT I HAD PLANS

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Granddad: WELL, SEE, I HAD TO
GO INTO THE BATHROOM TO TAKE A

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I WANT YOU TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU
TO DO BUT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Huey:  YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
TONIGHT.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
COMFORTABLE CURSING IN A
PROFESSIONAL SETTING, AND --

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
DU-- UH, STAND AGAINST
SEGREGATION.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
UNCLE RUCKUS RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND BASICALLY ALMOST WON.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
>> Ruckus: PLANS? PLANS?

04:40.000 --> 04:40.000
DO IT!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
AIN'T NO NIGGA MAKE NO PLANS!

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
Tom: WHAT?!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
BUT WHY NOT JUST TELL ME?!

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
WAIT!

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
AND THEY SAID, "NIGGA, DON'T YOU
DARE GO INTO THAT BATHROOM."

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
HIS STANDOUT MOMENT WAS DURING

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
NIGGAS JUST REACT TO OUTSIDE

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I THINK I HAVE THE PERFECT JOB.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Sarah: BECAUSE!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
STIMULI.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NO WOMAN WAKES UP AND SAYS,
"GEE, I HOPE MY MAN DOES

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEBATE.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
NOW, I GOT SOME PLANS, TOO.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
AND I SAID, "YOU DON'T SCARE ME,
WHITE MAN.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
EVERYTHING I TELL HIM TO TODAY."

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
UNCLE RUCKUS, GIVE US YOUR
STRONGEST CRITIQUE OF

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
I PLAN TO KEEP YOUR BLACK ASS

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
AND MY NAME AIN'T 'NIGGA.'
YOU WILL ADDRESS ME AS

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
HERE.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Granddad: IS THAT A FULL-SIZE

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
YOU'RE THE MAN, TOM!

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
SOMETIMES I WANT YOU TO
DOMINATE!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
>> Granddad: SUMBITCH!

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
'MR. FREEMAN.'"
AMAZING.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
ONE MINUTE.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Ruckus: I DON'T NEED A
MINUTE.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
SHAMPOO BOTTLE, NIGGA?!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
TAKE CONTROL!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
HE'S A BLACK SUMBITCH FROM THE
SWEATY JUNGLES OF KENYA.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
>> Riley: YOU HEARD THAT MAN,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
GET OVER HERE, AL-QAEDA!

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
IF I'M OUT OF LINE, PUT ME IN
CHECK!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
GRANDDAD.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO BE

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
STURDY, DID YOU HEAR THIS?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Tom: SURE, HONEY.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
FEEDING THESE BITCHES.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
>> Granddad: EVERYTHING'S FINE.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
YES, I DID.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
HE'S GOT MY VOTE.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Sarah: OHH! TOM!

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
Huey: EVENTUALLY, GRANDDAD'S
PRIDE GOT THE BEST OF HIM.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
YOUR COURAGE IS AN INSPIRATION,
BROTHER.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Tom: FINE!

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
IT'S JUST ONE DINNER.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
NOW, LEADING THIS PARTICULAR
BUS WAS THE

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
I HEAR YOU!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
>> Riley: HUEY!

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
FROM NOW ON, I'LL TAKE CONTROL,
AND I WON'T APOLOGIZE ANYMORE.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
Huey:  ONCE NATIONAL NEWS, NOW PUBLIC ACCESS, RUCKUS CONTINUES

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
GRANDDAD'S TAKING BITCHES OUT TO

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
REVEREND STURDY HARRIS, WHO WAS

GOING ON A HOT

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
CIVIL RIGHTS SCENE.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
YOU WANTED ME TO STOP
APOLOGIZING, SO I'M SUPPOSED TO

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
STURDY WAS A VERY PHYSICALLY
IMPOSING MAN, A GRAD STUDENT AT

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
Ruckus: YOU SEE, FELLOW WHITE
AMERICANS, THIS IS WHY I AM

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
DO THE OPPOSITE OF THAT.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Granddad: UGH!

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
FISK UNIVERSITY, CAPTAIN OF THE
FOOTBALL TEAM, TOTALLY FEARLESS.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
RIGHT?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
UGH!

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
YEAH, SO THEN I GUESS I  WILL
APOLOGIZE, THEN...

RUNNIN' FOR MAYOR.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
Granddad: KISS MY BLACK ASS.

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
NOW, BEIN' BLACK IS BAD -- AIN'T
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT -- AND

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
THIS GUY WAS REALLY A SUPERIOR
HUMAN BEING, COMPLETELY

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
AW, DAMN IT.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
I'M OUT OF NAP-B-GONE!

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
Huey: I HAD TO CALL IN THE

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
DEDICATED TO THE CAUSE OF
JUSTICE.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
SORRY?

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
BEING POOR IS BAD, BUT  THIS
NIGGA HAS THE NERVE TO BE BOTH.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I MIGHT STILL HAVE TIME TO RUN

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Granddad: STURDY.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
GET OUT.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
TO THE STORE.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
BOY, I HATED THAT NIGGA.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000

PAY YOUR BILLS, DEADBEAT NIGGA.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
WE AIN'T GOT NO MONEY FOR WAVE

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Granddad: OW!

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Granddad: RUCKUS, I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
GEL.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Tom: OW!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
WYOU AIN'T GOT ENOUGH HAIR TOE

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000

THE MAN.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
SO, WHERE YOU FROM?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Riley: AW, MAN, HERE HE COME!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
WORRY ABOUT, NOWAY.

05:25.000 --> 05:25.000

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
SO, WHERE IS MR. FREEMAN
TRAVELING TO?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Granddad: RILEY, HIT THE
LIGHTS!

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Tom: HEY, HUEY.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Riley: MM-HMM.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
Ruckus: QUESTION IS, ROBERT,
WHAT ARE  YOU  DOIN' HERE...

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
Granddad: OH, HEADING BACK TO
CHICAGO.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Granddad: HUEY, ELECTRONICS!

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I CAME OVER AS SOON AS I PAID MY
TAXES.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
HERE IN THE WHITE MAN'S HOUSE
THAT YOU CANNOT AFFORD?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'M TIRED OF THAT HENPECKED
SIMP COMING OVER HERE EVERY TIME

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
WHOA.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
WHO PEED IN YOUR PETUNIAS,
ROBERT?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
SHE THROWS HIM OUT, SCREAMING
LIKE A LITTLE BITCH.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
OH, WHAT, WHAT, YOU THOUGHT YOU
COULD PAY YOUR MORTGAGE WITH

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
Granddad: STUPID HUEY HAD
THIS GREAT IDEA THAT A JOB COULD

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
UM, ROBERT, THIS BUS IS GOING
SOUTH.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
THIS TIME, HE CAN SLEEP IN THE
YARD.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Granddad: HUH?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
FOOD STAMPS, NIGGA?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.000
>> Granddad: AHH.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
HELP WITH MONEY PROBLEMS.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
NO, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO
CLEARLY SEE THE SUSPECT'S FACE,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
LOOK, YOU FAT, ONE-EYED BASTARD!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
PRETTY BOY. PLAYER.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Huey: HOW IS IT MY FAULT YOU
GOT FIRED?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOING NORTH.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
AUTHORITIES HA--

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
OH, NO.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Granddad: IT'S YOUR FAULT I
TRIED.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Tom: PLEASE.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
TRYING TO GET A JOB IS THE FIRST
STEP TO LOSING A JOB.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN ON THE
WRONG BUS.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I DON'T NEED THIS TODAY!

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Huey: IT'S TOILET PAPER AND

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Ruckus: THIS IS THE THANKS I
GET?

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Tom: ROBERT, LOOK -- I KNOW
IT'S HARD, BUT WE CAN FIND YOU A

HEY, CUTIE PIE.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
SORRY FOR THE LATE DATE.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
WHERE THIS BUS GOING?

TUNES.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I'M GOING BACK NORTH.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
NEVER FEAR.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Riley: I HOPE THAT'S THAT

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
BUT I HAD MONEY, AND AS LONG AS

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
SAY WHAT'S UP TO TOM DuBOIS.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
SHOW THAT BUILDS HOUSES FOR POOR
PEOPLE.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
I HAD MONEY, I COULD HAVE A

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
WE FELT LIKE IT WAS TIME TO TAKE
A STAND.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
MODERATELY SATISFYING SEX LIFE.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
HUH?

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
Tom: FLIZZY, I'M GONNA HAVE

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
THIS BUS IS GOING TO FREEDOM.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Granddad: THEN WE GOT TO TURN
THIS BUS AROUND.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
>> Riley: UGH.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
AIN'T GONNA LET
NOBODY TURN ME AROUND

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
KILL THE CAMERA, B.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tom: I ALSO THINK THESE
PEOPLE SHOULD LEAVE.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
FREEMAN.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I'M TIRED OF THIS LAWYER COMING

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Granddad: EXCUSE ME FOR A
SECOND.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Granddad: WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS FOR?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
THESE  MY  PEOPLE.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
YEAH, WE NEVER MET, BUT MY
FATHER TALKS ABOUT YOU SO MUCH,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
TIME AND A HALF.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY TO ME YOU
CAN SAY IN FRONT OF THEM.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Granddad: CAN I PAY YOU
DOUBLE TO TURN THE BUS AROUND?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Granddad:

IF ANYTHING, NIGGA, YOU THE
STRANGER HERE.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
NO, SIR.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
DAD TURNED OVER THE PROPERTY
MANAGEMENT TO ME.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
YEAH, IT DOES SEEM LIKE A WASTE.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
All:

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
YOU SHOULD LEAVE THE ROOM.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Tom: IT'S MY OFFICE.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
I'M GERALDINE.

MM. ROBERT, HUH?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
I KNOW THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY TO
YOU, BUT WE DO HAVE A STRATEGY.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
WHY IS THIS MY FIRST TIME SEEING
YOU?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MATTER OF FACT, WHY AM I EVEN

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
MR. WUNCLER THE SECOND.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Tom: YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR CRIMINAL CASE.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
CALL ME EDDIE.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
WHAT FLOOR YOU LIVE ON?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
Granddad: STRATEGY?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: OH, I DON'T LIVE
HERE.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
A BRILLIANT STRATEGY.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Granddad: THANK GOD.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I HAVE PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT ME.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
BEFORE.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
Tom: I REVIEWED THE CASE, AND
I'VE WATCHED THE SECURITY

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN -- SEEMS
LIKE A LOVELY PLACE.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
I LOVE STRATEGY.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
LAY IT ON ME.

07:12.000 --> 07:12.000
FOOTAGE.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
COOL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
OH, MY GOODNESS. LOOK AT THIS.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
THE MOST BRILLIANT STRATEGY
EVER CONCEIVED -- NONVIOLENT

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Tom: ALL RIGHT, JOKE TIME.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
CAN YOU GET ME OFF?

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
WHAT A LOVELY HOME.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
IS THIS THING ON? NO?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Tom: DID YOU ROB THE LIQUOR
STORE, FLIZZY?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
WELL, DID YOU TRY IT?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
DIRECT ACTION.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
THE COUCH IS...UH, BEAUTIFUL,
WITH THE...THE CARPET.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Granddad: COME AGAIN?

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
I CAN'T SAY THAT...I DID IT,
BUT, HONESTLY, REALLY CAN'T SAY

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
ALL RIGHT.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
YOU CONFRONT THE OPPRESSOR
AND HIS UNJUST SYSTEM.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S INVISIBLE AND
SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
OH, I-I'M SORRY.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
INCITE HIM TO VIOLENCE WITHOUT
RESORTING TO VIOLENCE YOURSELF.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
THIS IS MY ASSISTANT,
VANDERBILT.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.000
F'SHO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
Tom: AND WHY CAN'T YOU SAY
"F'SHO"?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
YOU DO HAVE A LOVELY HOME.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
MY FARTS AFTER I DRINK
ENSURE.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Granddad: WHY WOULD WE DO
THAT?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
WE'RE GONNA BE

SUPERIORITY.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I  used to have a lovely home.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Tom: WHAT?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Granddad: SO, WE MAKE THEM
WANT TO ATTACK US?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
IT'S LIKE YOU KIND OF GOT THAT

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000

Granddad: AND WE DON'T FIGHT

HEY, MAN, WHEN WE GO OUT, WE GO

07:31.000 --> 07:31.000
SO, LOOK.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
OH, GOD.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Granddad: WHAT ABOUT
SELF-DEFENSE?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW
COMPLICATED IT IS BEING ME.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
YOU KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
IT SMELLS LIKE STRAWBERRIES IN

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:34.000 --> 07:40.000
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WHERE I NEED
TO BE WITH THE HOUSE.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
THE ONLY SELF-DEFENSE ALLOWED IS
SINGING AND A SPECIAL KIND OF

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
IT'S PRETTY HOT.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. COME ON.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000

PROTECTS YOUR ATTACKER AT ALL

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD.

TWEETING FOR ME AT ONE TIME.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Granddad: YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, ROBERT!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000

Granddad: DO YOU EVEN HEAR
YOURSELVES?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
YOU'RE SITTING ON A GOLD MINE.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000

I DON'T KNOW.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
BELIEVE IN YOU, IT WOULD PAY OFF

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I THINK, AS A PEOPLE, WE'VE

I KNEW YOU WAS GONNA SAY THAT.

NUNS WAS TRYIN' TO HIDE

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I GOT IT FROM HUEY.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
ACTION, WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK
ABOUT IT, IS COMPLETELY INSANE.

08:05.000 --> 08:05.000

"I WANT THE DUDE THAT GOT

HELP YOURSELF.

IT GROWS HAIR OVERNIGHT.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Tom: MY ANSWER IS ALMOST
CERTAINLY NO, BUT...I'LL THINK

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
I MEAN IT.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000

THE NEW RATE ON YOUR SUB-PRIME,
NON-PRIME, UNDER-PRIME MORTGAGE

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000

HEADING TOWARD SERIOUS DANGER.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
YOU MEAN RUCKUS WAS AT THE
BIRMINGHAM STATION?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Tom: I GUESS HITTING A WOMAN
IS OKAY IF YOU HAVE ABS,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Nothing is going to be okay.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHORES,
ROBERT?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
ALL THIS TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Fake your deaths.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Tom: WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, OKAY.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
SLOW DOWN.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Ruckus: ROBERT FREEMAN WAS
THERE?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
"FLUID SWAP"?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
>> Granddad: GOOD IDEA.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
BECAUSE OUR GENERATION RAISED
NO-GOOD, SELFISH-ASS SONS.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
"RUB AGAINST MY ERECTION"?

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
WELL, AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
WRITE IT DOWN BEFORE WE FORGET.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
>> Huey: DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I ASKED MY SON TO VISIT ME.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
ONE SPARK, AND HEADS COULD

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
I LOVE
"YOU MAKE ME WANNA UNH!"

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
HE SAID, "I'M BUSY, MAMA."

BULL CONNOR MADE AN
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
Sarah: OUR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN
ROUGH ON HER.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
I LIKE THAT.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
RIDERS WITHOUT FEAR OF ARREST.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000

FREEMAN.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000

THIS ISN'T JUST HAIR RELAXER.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Granddad: HUEY, DRENCH MY

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Tom: I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT, FLIZZY.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
WE CAN MAKE MONEY OFF THE
HOUSE -- TOGETHER.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
THIS IS ART.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Riley: AW, NO!

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000

THE HATERS GET US DOWN.

Huey: WHAT KIND OF JOB WEARS
SUITS ON THE NIGHT SHIFT?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
I THINK THEY WERE JUST MAKING UP
WORDS AFTER AWHILE.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
WE GOT TO SHAKE THE HATERS.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000

WELL, GO ON.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Tom: NO.

IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CASE, YOU
CAN'T TAKE THE CASE.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
IT'LL BE LIKE OCCUPY, BUT RIGHT

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
AFRICAN-AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Riley: HUH?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Riley: WHERE DO  WE  LIVE?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE EARNED THE

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Granddad: RUCKUS, I'M NOT A
WHORE MAN.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
IT'S DAMN NEAR LIKE A WHOLE
OTHER HOUSE.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
I'M AN ESCORT.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
MAKE THIS SHIT FLY.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
YOU'RE THE BOSS...WILLONA.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.000
IS THAT IT?!

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000

11:01.000 --> 11:05.000
WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY WILL TELL

OF COURSE.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
TOM!

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
WHITE WOMAN WHO, TEMPORARILY
DOWN ON HER LUCK, USES THE

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000

YOU GOT NO FLASH, NO SWAG, NO
THIN VENEER OF TOUGHNESS.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
It's never too late to fake
your own death.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
HEY, NIGGER-LOVERS!

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
YOU, MY NIGGER, IS A HO.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
>> I'LL TAKE ALL OF IT --

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Riley: GRANDDAD!

SO, LOOK -- YOU TAKE THE
CASE, AND I TEACH YOU HOW TO

YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH DUDES?

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
ADVISE MY GRANDFATHER BRIEFLY?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
PLEASE, WE DON'T MEAN ANY -- OH,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
DRESS AND HOW TO TALK TO BITCHES
AND SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Granddad: HELL, NO!

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
I'M ESCORTING LADIES.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Tom: YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
We need to get up out of here,

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Riley: WELL, THAT'S ALL
RIGHT, THEN.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
WHY NOT?

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Granddad.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO
DANCE, RIGHT?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
>> Granddad: LEAVE? WHY?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
ACTUALLY, THAT'S KIND OF
GANGSTA.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
OH, GOD! OH, GOD! HELP US!

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
NO.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
>> Huey: 'Cause they're

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Huey: YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
GET A REAL JOB.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
NO DANCING.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
gangsters.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
BUT THERE WILL BE A SHOPPING
MONTAGE.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
>> Granddad: GANGSTER?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Granddad: THIS IS A REAL JOB.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
WHAT THE HELL?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
BOY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
I DON'T SEE WHAT
THE BIG DEAL IS.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
TWO THINGS WOMEN HATE -- BROKE
MEN AND BORING MEN.

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
Granddad: HEY!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
MISS BOSS WILLONA IS A PILLAR OF

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Ruckus: THE BIG DEAL?!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
THE COMMUNITY.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
THE BIG DEAL IS THAT WOMEN WOULD
PAY TO  YOU!

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
>> I ASSURE YOU OUR OPERATION IS

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE NOT BROKE.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
NIGGER, YOU KNOW YOU WOULD
ANYTHING FOR FREE.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
OH, THIS IS

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Granddad: YES, UH, I'M THE

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
BUT YOU ARE BORING, AND WOMEN
HATE TO BE BORED, TOM.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Huey: GRANDDAD, YOU'RE NOT
REALLY GONNA DO THIS?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
OWNER OF THE HOUSE.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
>> Huey: BOSS WILLONA, THERE'S

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
PERFECT.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
YOU AIN'T THE OWNER OF THE
HOUSE.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THEY HATE TO BE BORED.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
EDDIE WUNCLER'S THE OWNER OF
THIS HOUSE

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
THIS STUFF.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Granddad: KNOW WHAT I'M NOT
GONNA DO?

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
A WOMAN WOULD RATHER BE WITH A
GUY THAT BEATS THEM TO DEATH

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
>> Granddad: NO, THERE ISN'T.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Granddad: YES, WELL, I'M
ROBERT FREEMAN, CIVIL RIGHTS --

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
WE SHOULD TELL THEM.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
TRUST ME, NIGGA, I KNOW.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
I KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
>> Granddad: DON'T LISTEN TO

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
HIM, BOSS LADY WILLONA.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
IT'S FUN, AND IF YOU CAN GET
PAID FOR IT, BETTER.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
BUT WHY DO THEY WANT ME, TOM?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
>> Riley: DAMN, HUEY.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
WHY YOU GOT TO RUIN EVERYTHING?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000

11:48.000 --> 11:48.000
DO YOU WANT?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
THAT'S THE EXACT SEX TALK I WAS
GONNA HAVE WITH YOU IN TWO

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Granddad:

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Granddad: I WAS HOPING TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
IS IT MY INCREDIBLE SEXINESS?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
NOT SO FAST, YOU CRACKER!

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Granddad: YES, BUT I WOULD
PREFER TO U--

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
TIME FOR GRANDDAD TO GIVE THE
LADIES WHAT THEY NEED.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
I SAID, "NOT SO FAST, YOU
CRACKER!"

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
WHAT IS THE SECRET TO MY
SEXINESS?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
STAND YOU.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
MY MONEY, MY JEWELS, FAME?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
STUFF IS DANGEROUS.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
MM. OHH.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
I ALMOST LAUGHED.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
COMPOUND.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
ABSOLUTELY.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
ARE WE ABOUT TO HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT?!

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
IT'S A HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
MM.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
BUT, REALLY, IT'S BECAUSE I'M A

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Granddad: NO, PLEASE.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
>> Granddad: DAMN IT, BOY.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
I DON'T WANNA HAVE A NIGGA
MOMENT.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS WHEN WE

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
GOD, I SHOULD HAVE SIGNED UP FOR

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
AAH!

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE
BATHROOM.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Granddad:

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
THAT'S WHAT ALL WOMEN WANT.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
EXPLOSIVE?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
OHH, ROBERT!

12:09.000 --> 12:09.000
Tom: WHY?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
YOU THINK THEM BITCHES OUT THERE

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I'LL GET YOU, YOU BLACK SLUT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
BECAUSE WOMEN HAVE NO
SELF-RESPECT!

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
CARE ABOUT A LITTLE FIRE?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Tom: WELL, MY WIFE HAS

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
THIS HERE WILL TURN YOUR BRAIN

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
ROBERT, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
NONVIOLENT!

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
SELF-RESPECT.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
GREEN.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
REALLY? YOU SURE?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
THIS STUFF HAS PLUTONIUM.

12:15.000 --> 12:15.000

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Granddad: NO.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Tom: YES!

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
HER?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Granddad: UNH-UNH.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
SHE'S AN EDUCATED, WELL-ROUNDED,
CONFIDENT WOMAN.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
THIS ONE HERE IS ACID.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Granddad: NO!

12:18.000 --> 12:18.000

Granddad: NOPE.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
HEY, YOU BIG, OLD PICKANINNY!

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
THAT'S IT!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
JUST ACID.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
AND WHAT ABOUT HER?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I MAY NEED TO MEET HER.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Granddad: NO, MARGE SIMPSON'S

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Tom: NO, NO, NO. NO.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
OH, THAT'S THE WHOLE HOUSE.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
DON'T YOU GET IT?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I KNOW WHERE THIS GOES.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
A MAN CAN'T TRULY CALL HIMSELF A
MAN ONCE A STRANGER'S ASS CHEEKS

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
THESE BITCHES WOULD PUT NAPALM

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
HUH?!

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
YOU'RE PRETTIER THAN TONIGHT'S
ENTIRE LINEUP AND ALL OF BASIC

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO MY WIFE.

UNTHINKABLE.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Granddad: YOU CAN'T THROW
AWAY MY OLD SHIRTS!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S THE

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
STARRING THE GREAT KEANU REEVES
AND THAT AMERICAN SWEETHEART,

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
GOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO TELL BLACK

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
I RELIVE MY GLORY DAYS IN MY OLD
SHIRTS!

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
COUPLE OF DAYS?

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE ANYONE ELSE
TO CALL.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Granddad: SURE. ANYTHING.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
WOMEN THEY CAN'T HAVE LONG,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
SANDRA BULLOCK.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
BEAUTIFUL HAIR.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
BUT IF WE DON'T GET RID OF
YOUR UGLY CLOTHES, WHERE WILL I

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
>> UNH-UNH.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
"IF YOU STOP THE BUS, THE
BOMB WILL NOT EXPLODE.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
EH, NO SWEAT, MAN.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
OR BLACK MEN, EITHER.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
THAT WAS ROUGH.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
>> Granddad: SO, YOU DON'T CARE

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
PUT MY CLOTHES?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Tom: YEAH, IT WAS A DISASTER.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
THAT IT'S ILLEGAL?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Granddad: IN YOUR HOUSE!

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
IF ANYONE LEAVES THE BUS, THE
BOMB WILL NOT EXPLODE."

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
SO MUCH FOR MAKING A MAN OUT
OF ME.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
SO, WE JUST CAME BY BECAUSE
THE GOOD NEWS IS, WE'VE RENTED

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
YOU KNOW I SOLD MY HOUSE TO
PAY FOR YOU.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
>> JUST BETWEEN US, MY BUSINESS

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
NAW, MAN.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Ruckus: "AND IF YOU TURN THAT
BUS AROUND AND LEAVE DECENT

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
TO JUST STAND UP AND WALK OUT,
THAT TOOK GUTS.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ALL THE ROOMS IN YOUR HOUSE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
ISN'T ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Granddad: DAMN!

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
Tom: ALL I ENDED UP LEARNING
IS MY WIFE LIKES YOU BETTER.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
BAD NEWS IS, WE'RE STILL NOT
REALLY MAKIN' A DENT IN YOUR

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
>> Granddad: NO!

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
WHITE FOLKS ALONE, THEN THE BOMB
WILL NOT EXPLODE."

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
DEBT.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
>> Huey: YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
PROMISED HER MORE, GRANDDAD.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE ME
BETTER.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
THERE IS NO WAY I'M MAKING MORE.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
HUH.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
YOU GUYS ARE BOTH JUST BORING
AS

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I'LL JUST PUT THIS IN THAT NICE,

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
>> Granddad: FINE.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK THAT WAS
PERFECTLY REASONABLE.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
WE'LL MAKE IT.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
SHE USED REAL SWEET POTATOES.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
YOU'RE ROLLING WITH ME TONIGHT.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
>> Riley: YEAH, YEAH.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
WE'LL MAKE IT, NIGGA.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
I'M TAKING YOU TO MAN CAMP.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
YOU THINK YOU THE ONLY ONE IN

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
BUT I DON'T HANG WITH NO
NEGATIVE-ENERGY-SUCKING

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
COOL CORNER.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
THIS HOUSE WHO KNOWS CHEMISTRY?

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
OKAY. INSTRUCT ME ON WHAT YOU
EXPECT AT NIGHT -- TELL YOU

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
Granddad: UH...

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
>> Huey: OBVIOUSLY.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
SO GATHER UP SOME
POSITIVITY IN THIS BITCH RIGHT

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
>> Granddad: OKAY. WELL, UH-HUH.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
SURE. Y-YEAH.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
YOU LOOK BETTER WITHOUT MAKEUP,
A COUPLE OF "I'LL KILL MYSELF IF

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
I GOT A LITTLE OF THE STUFF

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
QUICK AND LET'S ROLL OUT.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
LEFT.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Tom: OKAY! I CAN BE POSITIVE.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
I CAN SEND IT TO A LAB. YEAH.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
SORRY, THERE, FREEDOM
FELLERS -- TIME AND A HALF JUST

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
THAT ALWAYS WORKS ON TV.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
YOU LEAVE ME"?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'M NOT A LOSER.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'LL GET IT ANALYZED.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
YOU'RE JUST SILLY-ACTING.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.000
I CAN...GET STUFF...HAPPENING,
AND I GOT STUFF GOING ON!

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
SO, Y'ALL HAD ANY LUCK WITH
THE MONEY?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I'LL MAKE IT MYSELF.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
AIN'T WORTH IT.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Granddad: WHEN DID THEY START

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Granddad: WELL, IT'S BEEN
REAL -- HOPE YOU REACH THE

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
MAYBE...MILLION, AT LEAST?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
>> Riley: ANALYZED, NIGGA.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
PROMISED LAND.

16:38.000 --> 16:38.000
SOMETHING?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Granddad: EDDIE, I'M SORRY.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
KNOCKING?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
THE STRUGGLE NEEDS YOU,
ROBERT.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
I TAUGHT THEM.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Granddad: NIGGA, IF YOU DON'T
GET OUT OF MY WAY --

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
THINGS COULD BE WORSE.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
IT'S GOOD MANNERS.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I COULD BE THAT GUY.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
THINK, EDDIE, THINK.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
>> Huey: EVEN IF YOUCOULDGET

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Huey: RILEY'S TALKING IN HIS
SLEEP.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
I'M MOSTLY INDIAN ON MY MAMA
SIDE, ANYWAY.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
THE INGREDIENTS, YOU MIX THAT

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
I CAN'T LET YOU OFF THIS BUS,
ROBERT.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.000
IT'S A MIRROR, TOM.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
Riley: I'M JUST READING.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.000
VANDERBILT?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
FIND ME A WAY TO GET ROBERT THAT
MONEY.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
STUFF THE WRONG WAY, YOU'LL BLOW

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
TRICK-ASS NEW GRANDMA TOLD ME

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
YOUR PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON
YOU.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
UP THE WHOLE HOUSE WITH US IN

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE, SIR.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
SHE SAID READIN' WAS HOW SHE GOT
RICH ENOUGH TO RENT GRANDDAD.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Granddad: YOU KNOW THAT'S
KIDNAPPING, RIGHT?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
>> Granddad: WUNCLER OWNS THIS

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
I SHOULD HAVE CALLED THE POLICE
ON HIS ASS.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
THEIR CREDIT IS...PISS-POOR,
SIR.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
HOUSE.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Granddad: ENOUGH.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
BUT I WAS LIKE, "LET ME?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
NO!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD, STOP!

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
GET YOUR ASSES IN BED.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
>> Granddad: YOU CAN HELP ME DO

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
I'M A GROWN-ASS MAN.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
THIS MAN IS A CUSTOMER.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
IT SAFELY OR WATCH ME BLOW THIS

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
I DO WHAT THE HELL I WANT."

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
YOU GOT RILEY READING?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
HE IS A DEAR FAMILY FRIEND.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
UP.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
HE IS A WAR HERO -- A
CIVIL-RIGHTS LEGEND!

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
>> Riley: YOUR CALL, NIGGA.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
WHOO!

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
THAT MUST HAVE TAKEN A BEATING
AND A HALF.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
WE MUST FIND A WAY TO HELP HIM!

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
>> Huey: YOU TWO HAVE TO FOLLOW

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
I DIDN'T BEAT HIM.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
NO!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
MY INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
WE SISTERS HAVE OUR WAYS.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
NO! I WANT OFF THE BUS!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
WELL, THERE IS ONE WAY.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
OKAY, I  THREATENED  TO BEAT
HIM -- THE WAY MY MOM DID.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
WELCOME.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
>> Riley: OKAY, OKAY, HUEY.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I SEE YOU.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
PLEASE, LET ME GO!

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
MAYBE YOU AIN'T SO GAY AFTER

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
GOT REAL DEMON IN THE EYES AND
LOOKED AROUND AT ANYTHING IN

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
SO, WITH A BOMB ON THE BUS
AND STURDY BASICALLY HOLDING

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
Tom: OH, WHAT THE HECK.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
ALL.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
IT'S MAN CAMP.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Granddad: HUH?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
>> Huey: AND WE CAN'T DO ITR

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
AT WUNCLER BANKING, WE DO
BELIEVE IN OFFERING QUALITY

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
HERE.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
BANKING SERVICES TO THOSE WITH
DAMAGED CREDIT.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
WE NEED TO SET UP SOMEWHERE

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
SIGHT THAT COULD BE USED TO BEAT
THAT ASS.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
ROBERT CAPTIVE, THE BUS
CONTINUED ON TOWARD MISSISSIPPI

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
NOBODY WILL FIND IT.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
Granddad: A LOAN! YES!

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
GOD, I ALWAYS WANTED KIDS.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
I'LL TAKE IT!

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
HOW 'BOUT I KICK IN AN EXTRA
$200 A WEEK AND YOU LET THE BOYS

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
COULDN'T YOU HAVE GOTTEN

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Granddad: I DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG WE WERE ON THAT BUS.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
DONE!

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
SOMETHING NICER?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
CONGRATULATIONS!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I BELIEVE IN YOU, ROBERT.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
CALL ME "MOM," HMM?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
ALL I KNOW IS THEY KEPT SINGING
THAT SAME DAMN SONG OVER AND

17:19.000 --> 17:19.000

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
WE'RE COOKING HAIR RELAXER.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
I BELIEVE IN THE FREEMAN FAMILY!

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
WILL THIS WORK?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Granddad: $200?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
>> Huey: YEAH. IT'LL WORK.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
VANESSA, LET'S NOT DO THIS
ANYMORE.

17:22.000 --> 17:27.000
AIN'T GONNA LET
NOBODY TURN ME AROUND

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
FREEMAN FAMILY! FREEMAN FAMILY!

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
LET'S GET TO IT.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
>> Riley: WHOA!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
I'M TRYING TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
WHAT YOU DOING?

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Tom: HEY, THIS IS THE
BUY-N-FLY THAT FLIZZY ROBBED.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
YOU'RE MORE STUPID THAN I
THOUGHT.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
>> Granddad: I CAN'T HAVE MY

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.000
CLOTHES SMELLING LIKE THIS

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
STUFF.

17:29.000 --> 17:29.000
YOU'RE PRETTY.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
YOU MAKE A MEAN
SWEET-POTATO PIE.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
>> Riley: YES, YOU CAN.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
FUNNY.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
AS WE WERE APPROACHING THE

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Granddad: THAT WENT WELL.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
HEY, I AIN'T GETTING IN THERE

17:32.000 --> 17:32.000
YOU'RE SMART.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I'M NOT SMART.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Huey: DID YOU CHECK THE
INTEREST RATE?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
UNTIL HE PUT ON SOME CLOTHES.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE, WE SAW A
BLACK CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
I CAN'T EVEN BUY THE RIGHT
HOOKER.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Granddad: 150% INTEREST?!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
>> Granddad: SHUT UP.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
LET'S GET TO IT.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I BOUGHT THE ONE THAT BREAKS UP
WITH ME.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
ROAD, AND THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN
WAVING US DOWN.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
Riley: WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
Y'ALL KNOW I DON'T DO MATH.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
>> Riley: WHY HE ALWAYS FINDING

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Tom: TYLENOL?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Granddad: IT MEANS NOW I'M
ANOTHER MILLION IN DEBT.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
EXCUSES TO GET NAKED, HUEY?

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Granddad: I'M NOT BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
PRESIDENT KENNEDY, WHO WAS
GREATLY EMBARRASSED BY THE

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
IT'S GAY.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
IT WAS A RIP-OFF, AN EASY-CREDIT
RIP-OFF!

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I'M JUST THINKING YOU COULD BE
REALLY HAPPY WITHOUT PAYING FOR

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
EVEN WORSE, IT'S HOMOSEXUAL.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
CONTROVERSY GENERATED BY THE
FREEDOM RIDERS, HAD SENT A

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000

LEFT FOR THIS TRIP.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
I PROMISE YOU, I'M WORTH BEING
BITCH-SLAPPED FOR.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
CAN YOU THROW ME A LINE?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Granddad: I DIDN'T!

Tom: UH, NOPE!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000

THANKS, JACK.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000

NO.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Granddad: THAT'S ALL THEY

HOW ABOUT "CAKE"?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
IT'LL BE FINE.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
SURE THING, MRS. DuBOIS.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
THESE NIGGERS WILL NOT CROSS THE
STATE LINE.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
THEY'RE MY LONELY, BITTER
GIRLFRIENDS.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
RUCKUS?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.000
Ruckus:  BRAVE WHITE MEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, YOU ARE THE

WHOOPS.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
>> Huey: PUT OUT THE CIGARETTE.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR THE WHITE MAN'S ENTIRE GLORIOUS WAY

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
SORRY, I WAS JUST CUTTIN' SOME,
UH, MEAT EARLIER.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Granddad: I THOUGHT WE -- I
JUST GOT MY ASS KICKED FOR YOU!

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
WHAT'S UP, TIGER?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Tom: YOU FAKED THE ROBBERY.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
I'M KIDDING!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
OF LIFE.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
Tom: I WATCHED THE
SURVEILLANCE TAPE, FLIZZY -- THE

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
THEY KNOW WE'RE A COUPLE.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
IF THAT BUS CROSSES THIS LINE, IT SETS OFF A SERIES OF

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
THIS PLACE, THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
WON'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
BUT THE PART ABOUT THEM BEING
LONELY AND BITTER -- TRUE.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
WHOLE  TAPE.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
>> Granddad: LET ME SEE.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I KNOW YOU STAGED THE ROBBERY.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
GUYS.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN HELP
THIS MAN?

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
OH, YOU'RE JUST AS HANDSOME
AS VANESSA SAID.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
YOU JUST COULDN'T LEAVE
ALONE, COULD YOU?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
I'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE POUR.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
FIRST, THERE WILL BE INTEGRATED DINERS AND BATHROOMS AND THEN

19:17.000 --> 19:21.000
Ruckus: YES, SIR, MR. KINDLY
BILLIONAIRE WHITE MAN.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
AND YOUR GRANDKIDS ARE SO
WELL-MANNERED.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Tom: WHAT ELSE WAS FAKE?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
THEN A PINCH AND A SPLASH.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
SCHOOLS.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WERE THE NICARAGUAN GUNS FAKE?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
OR IS IT A SPLASH, THEN A PINCH

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
WHERE THEIR DADDY AT?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
DID YOU REALLY EVEN BEAT
CHRISTIANNA?

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
UNCLE RUCKUS CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT BROKE NIGGA.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
I BET THAT NO-GOOD NIGGER
DROPPED THEM OFF WITH YOU AND

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
THERE WILL BE NIGGER QUARTERBACKS, NIGGERS WINNING

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
DON'T YOU  EVER  QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT I BEAT

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
AND A POUR?

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
ACADEMY AWARDS, NIGGERS PLAYING DOCTORS ON TELEVISION, AND

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
NEVER LOOKED BACK, RIGHT?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
CHRISTIANNA!

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
>> Huey: WRONG ONE.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I WHUPPED THAT BITCH'S ASS!

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
WE GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY
PRAYING WE FIND A MAN LIKE YOU.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
EVENTUALLY, EVEN THE WHITE HOUSE WON'T BE WHITE.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
LOOK, IT'S FORMER
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND THE

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
BUT THE NICKI MINAJ THING WAS
STAGED.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
>> Granddad: AAH!

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE KEEP
GOING.

19:29.000 --> 19:35.000
WHITE MEN, YOU MUST STOP THIS BUS!

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
NEXT MAYOR OF WOODCREST,
UNCLE RUCKUS!

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
SHE AIN'T REALLY A CYBORG,
EITHER.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
ONLY GOOD MAN IN THERE IS JESUS.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
SHE'S A NICE GIRL.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Ruckus: OH, THE FREAKNIK
CIRCUS HAS COME TO TOWN IN

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You get in there and you do the
thing I'm talkin' about.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
DAMN, TOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Ruckus: Yeah, the only thing
they understand.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
ROBERT FREEMAN'S LIVING ROOM.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
GOOD.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Tom: I'M YOUR ATTORNEY!

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
GIRLS, THAT'S RUCKUS.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
NOW SCRAM BEFORE SOMEONE SHOOTS
YOUR BLACK ASS BY MISTAKE.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Ruckus:

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
THIS  IS  MY BUSINESS!

19:39.000 --> 19:39.000
BUT WHY?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
HE IS CRAZY!

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
Ruckus: OH, OH, YES, SIR,
MR. BULL, SIR.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
'CAUSE I GOT TO STAY
RELEVANT! THAT'S WHY!

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
BUT IF HE'S ROBERT'S FRIEND,
THEN HE'S MY FRIEND, TOO.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
SUCKS RIGHT
NOW!

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000

TURN BACK.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
FACES!

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
Ruckus: THAT'S RIGHT -- I

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
BUT IF I CAN STAY IN JUST THE
RIGHT AMOUNT OF TROUBLE, I'LL BE

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT AS
"SLAVERY."

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
>> Huey: GRANDDAD!

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
PLEASE.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I THINK ABOUT IT AS INVESTING IN
PEOPLE.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
DIDN'T FORGET YOUR REQUEST.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.000
ALL RIGHT.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
MY AUDIENCE IS WOMEN, TOM --
WOMEN.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
I INVEST IN YOU, YOU HELP ME.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
THE MOST POWERFUL
BLACK-BITCH-BEGONE EVER -- A

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
AND WOMEN HATE TO BE BORED.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Huey: HELP YOU DO WHAT?

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Riley: YEAH, WHAT WE GOT TO
DO IN RETURN?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
>> Riley: THIS IS ALL YOUR

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
BEAUTIFUL WHITE WOMAN.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
OPEN FIRE!

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Tom: LOOK, FLIZZY, I'M SORRY.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
FAULT, GRANDDAD.

19:55.000 --> 20:05.000
AAH! NO! AAH!

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
IT BETTER NOT BE NOTHIN' GAY.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Granddad: NO! MAKE HER LEAVE!

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANY OF THIS.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
IF WE DIE, I AIN'T NEVER GONNA

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
NO.

19:58.000 --> 20:02.000
FORGIVE YOU.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I DON'T LIVE IN YOUR WORLD.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
IT JUST MEANS YOU GET TO LIVE IN
100% OF THE HOUSE 100% OF THE

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Ruckus: THAT AIN'T POSSIBLE.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
I'M A SIMPLE GUY.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
WHITE WOMEN ARE LOYAL -- FOR
REAL.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
I JUST WANT TO DO MY JOB, TAKE
CARE OF MY FAMILY, AND I NEEDED

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
>> Granddad: DON'T TURN OVER!

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
TRY TO KICK HER.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
TIME, AND, IN EXCHANGE...

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
SOME HELP TRYING TO GET MY WIFE
BACK.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Huey: YOU OWN US.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.000
AAH!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
SHE'LL JUST LOVE YOU MORE.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
NO, I JUST OWN 100% OF YOUR
TIME UNTIL THE DEBT IS PAID.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Granddad: PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
EVEN THE OLD ONES GONE WHITE
LIKE THEY'RE DAMN NBA PLAYERS OR

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
BE STRONG.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
OH, YOU WANT YOUR WIFE BACK?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
THAT'S FAIR, RIGHT?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
GOD WILL PROTECT US.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
HOW ABOUT NOT INVITING A NIGGA
THAT'S RICHER THAN YOU AND

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Huey: NO!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Granddad: OH, SHUT THE
UP!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
SURE, IT IS.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Granddad: THIS IS ALL A
STUPID MISTAKE.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I COME BY
UNANNOUNCED, IN THE MIDDLE OF

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
AAH!

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
PRETTIER THAN YOU TO MEET YOUR
WIFE?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
PLEASE!

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I INVESTED ALL MY
MONEY IN YOU.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I MEAN, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE,
NIGGA?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000

WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.000
FLIZZY, I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Granddad: I'LL TAKE IT!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
HA HA! NOPE, NOT AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000

Huey: WHILE I RESPECT YOUR
LOYALTY, TRUST ME -- I'M RELATED

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000

I ALMOST FORGOT -- I WON THE
BET.

Sarah: OH, HONEY, I'M SO
SORRY.

21:32.000 --> 21:40.000
TO THESE PEOPLE, AND IF I HAD A
CHANCE TO GET OUT...

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
I WAS SUCH A BITCH, AND YOU
DIDN'T DESERVE ANY OF THAT.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Granddad: UH...WHAT BET?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
YOU BOYS DESERVE BETTER THAN

OH, WE MADE A BET THAT I
COULDN'T GET YOU GUYS TO SIGN

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
I'M GONNA TURN MYSELF IN.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
Tom: YES.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
ONE DAY, YOUR NATION WILL THANK
YOU.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Sarah: PLEASE COME HOME.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I WON.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
PLEASE.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
AND I LOST.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
I HEARD AN NBA STAR MOVED IN
DOWN THE STREET.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
HERE YOU GO, BOSS.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
