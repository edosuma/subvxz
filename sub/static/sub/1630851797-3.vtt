He's a friend from high school.
He's harmless.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.583

18:37.649 --> 18:39.351
I couldn't be a luckier man.

that the first time we met

18:42.488 --> 18:44.523

19:07.146 --> 19:10.215
Ida, I can't even begin
to express what I've learned

19:10.315 --> 19:11.683
from you over the years.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.886
Your courage
and willingness to be authentic

19:13.986 --> 19:16.989

has made me a better man.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.658

19:19.725 --> 19:21.727
But when you go to Six Flags
with your baby mama

19:21.827 --> 19:23.629

then I'm being extra?

19:23.695 --> 19:25.164
- Is that what you want
right now?

19:25.230 --> 19:27.566
You know that's different.
- No, it's not, D.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.968
I said, "Let's take TJ
to Six Flags."

19:30.035 --> 19:31.236
And then you go with her.

19:57.162 --> 19:58.397

19:58.497 --> 20:00.332
- He said, "I ain't biking
without Dez.

20:00.399 --> 20:02.868
I want Dez."

20:02.935 --> 20:05.103

disrespectful

22:08.160 --> 22:10.462
She was my wife.
