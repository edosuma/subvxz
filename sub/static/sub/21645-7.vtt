WEBVTT

00:48.400 --> 00:52.360
How lovely it is to be out, just us.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.878
- Get down!
- Albert, what on earth?

01:20.040 --> 01:23.431
There was a man, a boy perhaps,
he was pointing a gun.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.751
Ride on! Ride on!

01:26.760 --> 01:27.955
Scour the crowds!

01:28.120 --> 01:30.476
Get back! Move, move!

01:30.640 --> 01:33.917
My policemen have searched the area, sir,
but there is no sign of any man

01:34.080 --> 01:35.673
matching the description you gave.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.194
We should go out again at once.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.513
If he is still out there, he will try again
and this time he can be caught.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.672
This is not without risks, Ma'am,

01:43.840 --> 01:46.912
but I will place a man at
every step of the route.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.073
Surely you are not in agreement?
This is madness!

01:50.240 --> 01:53.199
I think the Queen is right, sir.
We should flush the creature out.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.951
Victoria... I want you to take this.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.229
Never inside, Sir.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.518
Please, Baroness, that is
a foolish superstition.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.071
This, on the other hand,
is an armoured parasol.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.074
- I have designed it myself.
- An armoured parasol?

02:12.240 --> 02:14.436
The chainmail runs all the
way along the lining,

02:14.600 --> 02:18.230
which means if you are fired at,
you are protected.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.394
I also had it designed in your
favourite colour, purple.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.559
Of course, Your Royal Highness,

02:25.720 --> 02:28.110
the Queen will be surrounded
by the Household Cavalry.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.476
Thank you, Lehzen.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.396
Oi, you gimp-faced loser!

02:41.560 --> 02:43.870
Lazy ratbag!

02:49.680 --> 02:51.717
God bless you, Ma'am!

02:53.880 --> 02:55.837
Look, there she is!

03:05.280 --> 03:07.272
Arrest that man!

03:08.040 --> 03:10.032
I will have my day in court!

03:10.920 --> 03:13.276
Move back! Move back!

03:13.440 --> 03:17.639
We've found the assassin.
Is this really necessary?

03:17.800 --> 03:20.998
Sir Robert is concerned
that there may be others.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.836
I wanted to go for a walk,
not to inspect the troops.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.832
Yes, I know but er...

03:28.240 --> 03:31.597
.. safety must come
before our inclinations.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.879
"Another diabolical attempt on
the life of our gracious Queen."

03:36.040 --> 03:38.794
I'm not sure it's right to call them
assassination attempts

03:38.960 --> 03:40.553
if none of their pistols were loaded.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.554
What do these boys want
if it isn't to kill the Queen?

03:43.720 --> 03:45.951
To be famous, of course.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.554
All these soldiers...
It's like we're in Prussia.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.189
Our home has become like a fortress.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.432
What choice do we have?
My wife must be protected.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.592
She is not just your wife.

04:00.760 --> 04:04.117
She is also a queen.
Yes, thank you, Ernest.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.760
I'm well aware of that.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.510
Duchess, I am glad to find you alone.

04:28.680 --> 04:31.957
I wanted to express my condolences.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.751
Condolences.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.560
What an ugly word.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.879
Then I... Can I tell you how sorry I am?

04:43.040 --> 04:45.316
I don't think that's right, either.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.430
Is there anything I can do to comfort you,
Harriet?

04:50.600 --> 04:53.354
You are the last person in the world
who could do that.

05:17.280 --> 05:18.475
Majesty.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.597
Waverley.

05:23.760 --> 05:28.880
I'd forgotten how good it is.
I used to love Bonnie Prince Charlie.

05:29.040 --> 05:32.954
Do you remember how I used to beg you
to take me to Scotland when I was little?

05:33.120 --> 05:36.113
I thought I would be happy there.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.155
If only I could have granted your wish.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.151
Well, there's nothing to stop me now.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.959
- Sir Robert...
- Ma'am.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.716
Since I cannot bear to live in
a military garrison here in London,

05:57.880 --> 05:59.360
I have decided to go somewhere else.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.638
- Are we travelling to the continent, Ma'am?
- No.

06:03.640 --> 06:06.109
Not... Ireland?

06:06.280 --> 06:07.714
No, Duchess.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.635
We are going somewhere
that even you might approve of.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.439
Scotland.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.957
You will return
in time to open Parliament, Ma'am?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.077
I'm aware of my duties, Prime Minister.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.034
I am so looking forward to hearing
the celebrated bagpipes.

06:23.200 --> 06:28.275
But surely you to do not intend
to leave your post, Baroness?

06:30.080 --> 06:33.437
Maybe next time, Lehzen,
when the children are a little bigger.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.114
As you wish, Majesty.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.276
Isn't the air wonderful?

06:51.280 --> 06:55.479
I did not know there was
so much wilderness in England.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.360
But this is Scotland, Albert.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.558
I must congratulate you
on your engagement, Mr Drummond.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.837
Florence and I are old friends.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.037
She's such a lovely girl,
and so accomplished.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.714
She has many virtues.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.590
My felicitations. I hope that she
is as pretty as she is talented.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.152
I believe she is considered quite,
er... personable.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.518
Oh, you English,
I think if you were to see Cleopatra

07:38.680 --> 07:41.036
bathing in asses' milk
you would blush and say,

07:41.200 --> 07:44.591
"Oh, I believe she is considered
quite personable."

08:10.640 --> 08:13.633
Your Majesty. Your Royal Highness.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.599
Duke. What a pleasant surprise!

08:16.760 --> 08:19.912
These are the Atholl Highlanders, Ma'am,
my personal army.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.152
- They are at your command, Ma'am.
- Thank you, Duke, but tell me,

08:23.320 --> 08:25.710
do you think I'm in
danger here in Scotland?

08:25.880 --> 08:29.317
Not while you have
the Atholl Highlanders, Ma'am. Please.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.710
That soup.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.951
What is it called again, Duchess?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.793
Sock a leekie?

08:45.280 --> 08:48.352
It's Cock-a-leekie, Sir.

08:48.520 --> 08:52.070
Or as I like to call it,
"the nectar of the glens".

09:14.000 --> 09:15.912
Where are they all going?

09:19.240 --> 09:21.675
Ever been to a ceilidh before?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.194
And now, Ma'am,
we have a special treat in store.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.080
As part of our midsummer celebrations,

09:29.240 --> 09:32.756
the renowned physician poet William Beattie

09:32.920 --> 09:36.038
has agreed to give us a
rendition of his epic,

09:36.200 --> 09:39.750
The Heliotrope, A Paean To Health.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.877
Your Majesty.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.517
What is life?

09:52.680 --> 09:56.196
Like a flower with the bane in its bosom.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.319
Today full of promise.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.837
Tomorrow it dies.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.872
- Dance?
- No. No, no, no. I can't.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.071
I can't. Please.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.197
- Please don't make me do this.
- Ready?

10:28.200 --> 10:30.032
Here we go. To the left.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.959
And spin.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.951
But with the dawn

10:49.120 --> 10:54.149
dark signs in sea and ocean...

10:55.320 --> 11:00.270
.. announce impending dangers to our crew.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.154
Marshalled on the horizon

11:05.320 --> 11:08.791
clouds in motion...

11:09.920 --> 11:13.516
.. gathered, condensed

11:13.680 --> 11:17.390
and into blackness grew.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.951
Thank you, Mr Beattie.
Tha-That was most... enlightening.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.637
I think I'd rather be hung, drawn and quartered
than listen to another minute of that!

11:47.680 --> 11:50.798
You really don't have to
stand guard all night.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.350
His Grace's orders, Your Majesty.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.835
Oh, well...

12:00.160 --> 12:04.951
Well, I think we will be... safe in here.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.913
Do you think?

12:23.280 --> 12:26.034
Oh! Not again!

12:27.280 --> 12:29.192
Beastly instrument!

12:29.360 --> 12:32.876
It sounds like the noise a deer makes
when it is being slaughtered.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.838
It's not bad.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.720
In fact, I find it rather rousing.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.232
Good morning, Ma'am. Your Royal Highness.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.676
- I trust you slept well.
- Indeed, Duke.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.309
I thought today you might like to
inspect the alms houses up at Crathie,

12:51.480 --> 12:53.517
and to visit the new smokery.

12:53.680 --> 12:56.957
You'll be pleased to hear Dr Beattie
has a new poem for us tonight.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.875
I wonder, Duke, if we might postpone
the alms houses for another day?

13:01.040 --> 13:04.920
The Prince and I would very much like
to see something of the countryside.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.520
Of course, Ma'am.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.435
It's the River Garry, Sir.
Best fly fishing in the country.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.398
Oh, thank you.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.072
Will you join me?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.953
- You'll have to teach me.
- Are you safe?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.679
- Yes.
- Bend down.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.314
Hold tight.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.439
Your hands... with my hands.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.320
Oh, Lord Alfred, isn't the scenery sublime?

13:59.320 --> 14:00.879
Heavenly.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.352
Pull.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.239
- That was very eager.
- I think we nearly caught Drummond!

14:24.080 --> 14:27.039
Albert, why don't we ride back?

14:32.320 --> 14:35.074
- Duke?
- Ma'am.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.471
The Prince and I would like to ride back.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.199
Are... are you sure, Ma'am?

14:39.360 --> 14:42.797
It's er... Well... It's not a side saddle.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.920
Quite sure.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.950
I have a very good
sense of direction, Duke.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.589
- We will not get lost.
- Excellent!

14:51.760 --> 14:53.991
Don't let them out of your sight.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.317
Alone at last.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.118
Indeed we are.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.634
Stop the carriage! Stop!

16:11.480 --> 16:13.870
- Where's Her Majesty?
- I thought she was with you, Sir.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.874
The Queen and Prince
have gone astray.

16:17.040 --> 16:18.440
They can't be that far behind.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.434
I don't understand how it happened.
I took every precaution.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.513
The mist coming in, I shouldn't have
let the Queen out of my sight.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.558
We should waste no time
in looking for them.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.756
- Yes.
- Lord Alfred?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.071
You men come with me.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.438
Quicken yourselves up.
Some of you head up the hill there.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.598
Where are we?

16:46.680 --> 16:48.751
I thought we were headed back to the road.

16:48.920 --> 16:53.949
Well, we have come a little further
than perhaps we intended,

16:54.120 --> 17:00.037
but I'm sure if we just continue
in this direction, we'll find our way.

17:12.599 --> 17:16.070
If we fell, it could be
months till we were found.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.640
You seem very calm at the prospect.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.671
I'm more afraid of going back to London.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.193
Really?

17:28.119 --> 17:31.158
I noticed you were reading
The Iliad on the boat.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.960
Not in the original, I'm afraid.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.476
I find the death of
Patroclus most affecting.

17:39.880 --> 17:44.113
Yes, the lengths Achilles went to
to honour his friend.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.832
You believe they were friends?

17:50.480 --> 17:52.756
I wouldn't know what else to call them.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.351
Look at this mist.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.150
I do hope Lord Alfred and Mr Drummond
don't get lost, too.

18:17.320 --> 18:21.280
Don't worry. Lord Alfred
is very resourceful.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.638
- Have you known him long?
- All my life.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.917
We had the same dancing master.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.272
I don't know that I am a
very good judge of men.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.317
Who is, Miss Coke?

18:36.480 --> 18:41.680
Even if I disliked Florence, my
family wouldn't consider that an obstacle.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.797
And do you, dislike her?

18:43.960 --> 18:48.000
No. In fact, I care for her deeply but...

18:50.040 --> 18:52.077
.. I don't think I'll ever, erm...

18:52.240 --> 18:53.674
Love her?

18:57.480 --> 18:58.880
Mm.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.472
We should be heading back.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.393
Do you think we're lost?

19:19.600 --> 19:22.991
- I don't remember any of this.
- No.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.838
Come on.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.952
Albert, are you sure?

19:48.120 --> 19:50.112
We crossed a river earlier,

19:50.280 --> 19:55.230
so it's only logical
that we must cross again to get back.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.913
Do not worry, Liebes.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.031
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

20:45.680 --> 20:48.070
So let's... let's keep going.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.555
Such incompetence!

21:41.800 --> 21:44.520
How can anyone lose a queen?

21:44.680 --> 21:46.956
It would never have
happened if I'd been there.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.840
I should've stopped the Queen and Prince
going off on their own.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.356
- Indeed, you should!
- You're not to blame, Drummond.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.273
Nobody, not even you, Duchess,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.750
can stop the Queen
when she puts her mind to something.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.877
I would have told her to be sensible!

21:59.480 --> 22:01.392
God knows where they are now!

22:01.560 --> 22:05.918
Probably at the bottom of Glen something
or other, with their necks broken.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.034
I am sure they will be found soon.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.117
How can you know that?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.840
Oh... I am an optimist.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.115
Or deluded.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.633
What is it that I am deluded about?

22:43.120 --> 22:49.151
I thought I could go back to my marriage and
everything would be just as it had been.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.629
My husband knew that horse
hadn't been broken in, the day he rode out.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.920
I killed him.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.594
You cannot think like that.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.231
It was a tragic accident, not your fault.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.074
Not my fault? God, you really are deluded!

23:07.240 --> 23:08.993
Harriet...

23:11.160 --> 23:13.675
A charming smile
won't change anything this time...

23:14.840 --> 23:17.116
.. Your Serene Highness.

23:35.400 --> 23:37.756
Perhaps I will ask here.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.314
Excuse me for disturbing you,
but erm... we have lost our way.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.753
Ye'd better come in then.

24:20.080 --> 24:23.391
Aye, make yourself at home, why don't you?

24:23.560 --> 24:28.680
Oh, erm, my wife has been rather agitated
since we were separated from our friends.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.150
She does not mean any offence.

24:31.320 --> 24:35.030
We wondered if perhaps
you would be able to help us

24:35.200 --> 24:39.035
find our way back... to Blair Atholl.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.590
Staying with His Grace, are ye?

24:52.280 --> 24:54.920
Well, you won't be going
back there tonight...

24:56.040 --> 24:58.396
.. unless you want to arrive in a coffin.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.351
Looking for someone, Mrs Skerrett?

25:08.520 --> 25:11.797
If you know where the Queen is,
I think it's time you confessed.

25:11.960 --> 25:15.317
No, I'm more interested in
another woman's whereabouts.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.914
- I feel so useless.
- Useless?

25:20.080 --> 25:23.278
Idling the time away
while the Queen is in danger.

25:23.440 --> 25:26.274
Perhaps you... need a distraction.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.355
Thank you.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.594
Mm! This trout is, erm... It's delicious.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.117
The manner in which it is cooked is, erm...

26:31.640 --> 26:33.359
Well, no word.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.756
Oh, would you object
if-if I stoked the fire?

26:42.920 --> 26:44.673
Object?

26:46.080 --> 26:49.039
I can tell you're not from these parts.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.590
We are from London.

26:52.840 --> 26:54.991
What are you doing here?

26:55.160 --> 26:56.799
Oh, erm...

26:57.600 --> 27:03.312
Well, we had to, er...
take some time away from our, our work.

27:03.480 --> 27:07.030
<i>- What is it that you do, then?
- What is it that we do?</i>

27:23.480 --> 27:28.316
- Oh, I am the owner of a factory.
- Actually, it's my factory.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.199
He helps me with the paperwork.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.636
No sign of them anywhere.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.030
Duke...

28:07.760 --> 28:10.480
.. I feel it is my duty to
inform the Prime Minister.

28:12.080 --> 28:14.436
Perhaps we should wait till daybreak.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.515
Not too tight.

28:18.680 --> 28:20.433
There we are!

28:20.600 --> 28:22.831
Albert. Albert, look!

28:23.000 --> 28:25.515
- I've learned how to darn a sock.
- Oh...

28:25.680 --> 28:29.196
- Well, you've made a start!
- It's marvellous.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.791
- We would like to retire.
- You what?

28:46.960 --> 28:50.476
- Do you have a bed we could use?
- Oh, aye.

28:53.920 --> 28:56.674
- But where will you sleep?
- Dinnae fash yourself.

28:56.840 --> 29:00.356
Morag and me will bed down with the horses.

29:01.000 --> 29:06.120
But... we'll be needing a wee dram first.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.912
There you go.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.113
Thank you.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.671
- Slainte mhath!
- Slainte mhath.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.038
- Slainte mhath?
- What does this mean?

29:29.200 --> 29:32.796
"We wish you well." "Good health."

29:34.360 --> 29:35.760
Slainte mhath.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.799
Why do I have to go next to the wall?

30:07.880 --> 30:12.875
When I had to sleep in the same
room as Mama, I would think of being Queen.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.951
I was so sure it meant freedom.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.951
Imagine if they never find us.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.316
Would you like that?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.117
There's no point even thinking about it.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.715
You looked so happy tonight.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.199
I was.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.118
Is that wrong?

30:39.280 --> 30:42.318
Nothing that makes you happy
could ever be wrong.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.350
What?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.758
Are they, er...?

31:39.720 --> 31:42.076
Well, good morning, husband.

31:50.640 --> 31:54.350
You know, erm...
I have some socks for you to darn.

32:03.760 --> 32:07.356
Perhaps we do not need
to be found just yet.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.077
Yes, sir.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.631
Get your hands off me!

32:22.400 --> 32:25.632
Please, let him be! He's a good man.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.120
And who are you?

32:29.840 --> 32:31.194
I'm Victoria.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.589
You may wait outside.

32:45.480 --> 32:48.279
Thank you both for your hospitality.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.599
We slept so well.

32:52.480 --> 32:56.520
I am sorry you had to
be found, Your Majesty.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.393
If I'd known you were coming,
I'd have made my oat cakes.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.479
We've had such a lovely time.

33:06.320 --> 33:10.519
- We don't want to leave, do we, Albert?
- No.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.753
Will you take this?

33:16.920 --> 33:19.958
You'll be wanting to practise your darning.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.959
Thank you.

33:40.640 --> 33:41.835
They're safe!

33:48.880 --> 33:50.109
Good.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.232
They have been found.

34:05.760 --> 34:10.312
- Harriet, about last night...
- I am sorry for the way I spoke to you.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.516
Your kindness reminded me...

34:14.560 --> 34:17.473
You cannot torment yourself forever.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.032
Enjoy the book.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.560
Your Majesty. Your Royal Highness.

34:42.719 --> 34:45.838
I am so ashamed this has happened
while you were in my care.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.072
- If anything had happened to you...
- But nothing did happen, Duke!

34:49.239 --> 34:51.994
The Prince and I, we erm...
we had a most entertaining evening.

34:52.159 --> 34:53.594
Oh!

34:53.760 --> 34:55.194
Victoria.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.032
I am very pleased to see you, Albert.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.791
Only to me.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.799
Your Majesty.

35:30.240 --> 35:31.754
How splendid.

35:45.400 --> 35:46.914
You know, Drummond,

35:47.080 --> 35:49.879
I believe we may have more fun
if we join the servants.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.994
After you!

36:03.280 --> 36:05.078
Right. After you!

36:28.280 --> 36:31.398
I'll have a
wee dram of that whisky.

36:49.760 --> 36:53.470
The midsummer evenings are so enchanting,
don't you think?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.720
A night like this makes me wish
I didn't have to go back.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.031
<i>You are Queen of Scots, Ma'am.</i>

37:52.040 --> 37:53.793
Yes.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.429
Yes, I am always a queen.

37:57.160 --> 38:01.040
If you'd come here a hundred years ago,
you would have found things very different.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.637
The Highlanders back then were for
The King Over The Water,

38:04.800 --> 38:06.871
until Culloden that is.

38:07.040 --> 38:12.434
I used to love the story of Bonnie Prince
Charlie escaping to Skye with Flora MacDonald.

38:12.600 --> 38:16.480
I remember telling my governess
I wanted to be a Jacobite.

38:17.520 --> 38:21.150
- She told me that wasn't possible.
- Not really, Ma'am, no.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.391
I have Stuart blood too, you know.

38:25.240 --> 38:29.757
You know what James Il, the last Stuart king
did, when he was leaving England for ever?

38:30.640 --> 38:34.270
He threw the great Seal of State
into the River Thames.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.353
James was selfish and weak.

38:37.520 --> 38:42.197
If the country wouldn't accept a Catholic king,
he didn't want them to have a king at all.

38:43.360 --> 38:48.310
He didn't understand that monarchy
is about more than just symbols.

38:48.480 --> 38:53.316
A real monarch puts the good of his,
or her, country,

38:53.480 --> 38:56.075
before their own inclination.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.595
My grandfather would turn in his grave
to hear me say this,

39:02.760 --> 39:05.514
but since I have met you, Ma'am...

39:06.480 --> 39:08.915
.. I am glad that the Jacobites failed.

39:11.960 --> 39:14.395
I hope your faith in me is justified.

39:14.560 --> 39:16.631
There's no doubt in my mind, Ma'am.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.476
Slainte mhath!

39:22.320 --> 39:23.515
Slainte mhath!

39:30.280 --> 39:31.953
Can I write to you?

39:33.960 --> 39:35.280
I don't think so.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.955
You may be married to your job
but you're still a woman.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.872
And that's why you can't write to me.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.157
Oh you've, er...
you've got a sweetheart in London?

39:43.320 --> 39:46.074
Something like that.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.993
Well, erm, he's not here now, is he?

40:20.840 --> 40:23.150
Back to London.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.391
Back to London.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.715
Would either of you care
to learn the bagpipes with me?

40:31.880 --> 40:34.679
I want to treasure these last moments
here in Scotland.

40:34.840 --> 40:36.593
So do I, Miss Coke.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.273
After you.

41:39.640 --> 41:40.960
Oh!

41:41.400 --> 41:44.120
Ohh, how I have missed you all!

41:44.280 --> 41:45.794
Look. It's a ball.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.633
This is for you.

41:47.800 --> 41:50.759
Why, you're quite the little Highlander!

41:51.520 --> 41:54.274
Oh, Lehzen, if only you could have
seen the Highlands, it was...

41:54.440 --> 41:56.033
it was just what we imagined.

41:56.200 --> 41:58.954
Lehzen, Vickie's looking rather thin.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.112
We have missed you.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.672
I was just coming to find you.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.116
The Queen would like dinner
in her rooms tonight,

43:01.280 --> 43:03.875
when she and the Prince return
from opening Parliament.

43:04.040 --> 43:05.838
- This is what she wants.
- Hm.

43:08.160 --> 43:11.437
It would appear the Queen has left
her reason behind in Scotland.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.478
I think she was happy there.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.474
How did you like Scotland, Mrs Skerrett?

43:17.640 --> 43:18.756
Did you dance a reel?

43:20.680 --> 43:22.637
I- I did my best but, erm...

43:22.800 --> 43:25.440
I've never had much sense of rhythm.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.356
You must have had quite a holiday here.

43:29.520 --> 43:32.274
Hm. I missed cooking for the Queen.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.876
It was foolish to think
that there was any job better than this.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.480
Victoria?

44:32.840 --> 44:35.196
Will you do the cooking?

44:38.760 --> 44:41.275
I have some sewing to do.
