02:20.687 --> 02:22.962
I say there ain't no monster.

02:23.047 --> 02:24.480
But we need men.

02:24.567 --> 02:28.640
And just to treat you fair and square,
we're paying double wages and a bonus,

02:28.727 --> 02:31.844
from Frisco to Shanghai and back,
all found.

02:31.927 --> 02:33.440
All dead, you mean!

02:33.527 --> 02:35.597
Don't sign with him, mates.

02:35.687 --> 02:38.679
You can't buy off the monster
with double wages and a bonus.

02:38.767 --> 02:41.440
You'll never get back to Frisco
to collect your pay.

02:41.527 --> 02:45.122
I got a man here that sailed on
the Golden Arrow and lived to tell about it.

02:45.407 --> 02:46.442
Come on, Billy.

02:48.447 --> 02:50.881
Tell 'em what you saw.

02:50.967 --> 02:53.003
It was the monster, all right.

02:53.087 --> 02:56.716
A cable's length long from beak to tail.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.923
And it came a-bellerin' out of the night,

02:59.007 --> 03:02.158
with one big eye like a lighthouse.

03:02.247 --> 03:05.125
We're stoved into starboard.

03:05.207 --> 03:07.801
We're smashed to port.

03:07.887 --> 03:11.402
And then it come up amidships.

03:11.487 --> 03:14.160
And broke our backs and sunk us.

03:14.247 --> 03:18.126
Forty poor sailor men drowned dead.

03:18.207 --> 03:20.767
The point is,
this thing is a ship killer.

03:20.847 --> 03:23.645
It's a miracle old Billy's alive today.

03:23.727 --> 03:27.481
- Tell 'em about its teeth, Billy.
- As big as a mainsail, I swear.

03:27.567 --> 03:30.764
And its breath...
Its breath was like a furnace.

03:30.847 --> 03:34.760
You got a pretty strong breath yourself,
me easy-talkin' friend.

03:35.527 --> 03:38.360
You mind answering a few questions?
I'm a harpooner by trade.

03:38.447 --> 03:41.007
Monsters interest me. All kinds.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.555
Keep away from him,
you noisy sea lawyer!

03:43.647 --> 03:46.798
I just wanna smell his breath.
I can already smell yours.

03:48.487 --> 03:51.604
Boiled down for his oil, lads,
there'd be free grog for all hands,

03:52.647 --> 03:55.639
if you can swallow it on top
of his tall yarns...

03:57.647 --> 04:00.207
There! There they are!

04:00.287 --> 04:01.800
- Stop it!
- Come on, Casey.

04:01.887 --> 04:04.799
This is no place
for a clergyman's son.

04:16.207 --> 04:18.084
Hey, Minnie!

04:18.166 --> 04:20.158
Hey, Daisy, come on!

04:24.847 --> 04:27.122
Let's shove off!

04:31.047 --> 04:34.039
Hey, what are you guys doing to me?

04:51.087 --> 04:54.284
Don't bother unloading.
Sailing's been cancelled.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.686
Cancelled again?

04:55.767 --> 04:57.758
This is ridiculous. We'll see about this.

04:57.847 --> 05:00.600
- Driver, you wait here.
- Yes, sir.

05:02.527 --> 05:04.518
Is it true
about the sailing being cancelled?

05:04.607 --> 05:07.360
Unfortunately, yes, Professor Arronax.
The crew deserted this morning.

05:07.447 --> 05:10.484
We just have to get to Saigon.
Isn't there some other ship?

05:10.567 --> 05:12.000
Not a thing. I'm sorry. Next.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.997
Halfway around the world from Paris,
and now this happens.

05:16.087 --> 05:18.317
There's nothing we can do about it.

05:18.407 --> 05:22.161
Except pack and unpack. That's all
I've been doing now for a month.

05:22.247 --> 05:24.158
Professor.

05:24.247 --> 05:27.603
At any rate, San Francisco will have
the honour of your company a while longer.

05:27.687 --> 05:30.918
I'm from the Bulletin. These gentlemen
are from the Globe and the Post.

05:31.007 --> 05:31.962
How do you do?

05:32.047 --> 05:34.322
We're interested in your opinion
of this monster.

05:34.407 --> 05:38.002
My opinion. Frankly, it's rather
low at the moment.

05:38.087 --> 05:42.399
But, actually, gentlemen, I don't know
any more about it than you do.

05:42.487 --> 05:44.478
Oh, Professor. Just a moment.

05:44.567 --> 05:45.363
Yes?

05:46.447 --> 05:50.122
Professor, what does the National
Museum in Paris think about it?

05:50.207 --> 05:51.276
I cannot answer that.

05:51.407 --> 05:55.241
We heard this expedition of yours
was to gather facts about the monster.

05:55.327 --> 05:57.318
I'm afraid you were misinformed.

05:57.407 --> 06:00.444
My reasons for going to the Orient
are purely scientific,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.324
if I ever get there.

06:02.407 --> 06:05.160
Professor, doesn't the giant narwhal
reach a length of 80 feet?

06:05.247 --> 06:06.600
Why don't you ask a fish?

06:06.687 --> 06:08.325
If we could go deep enough,

06:08.407 --> 06:10.921
we'd all be surprised
at the creatures down there.

06:11.007 --> 06:13.646
Could such a creature
destroy a ship or drag it under?

06:13.767 --> 06:16.235
Well, it might
if it were big enough.

06:16.327 --> 06:19.922
Don't you print that.
Please be careful, Professor.

06:20.007 --> 06:22.396
Well, gentlemen,
I shall prepare a statement later.

06:22.487 --> 06:26.036
You do not deny then that such
a monster could exist. Is that correct?

06:26.127 --> 06:28.846
- I'm not denying anything.
- Are you sure?

06:28.927 --> 06:32.203
- What are you drawing?
- A sketch of the monster.

06:32.287 --> 06:33.800
Thank you, Professor.

06:33.887 --> 06:36.765
- Good day.
- Good day, sir.

06:40.807 --> 06:43.241
Now put the wings on it.

06:44.247 --> 06:47.637
Look what they've done to me.
I made no such claims as this.

06:47.727 --> 06:49.957
- Look at this drawing.
- I knew it.

06:50.047 --> 06:52.766
"Living horrors of the deep
were described today

06:52.847 --> 06:56.078
"by Professor Arronax
of the Paris National Museum."

06:56.167 --> 06:58.965
Why, this is the most
far-fetched nonsense yet.

06:59.047 --> 07:01.356
Far-fetched?

07:01.447 --> 07:03.756
I think the proportions
are about right on the monster.

07:03.847 --> 07:06.361
You're not serious, Professor.

07:06.447 --> 07:09.484
I don't mean flying off
with a ship in its mouth.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.956
But the general size...

07:12.047 --> 07:15.596
Come to think of it,
it is a rather interesting conception.

07:15.687 --> 07:17.200
Excuse me. Professor Arronax?

07:17.287 --> 07:19.676
No more reporters.
You've done damage enough.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.120
Professor's very busy now.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.676
I'm not a reporter.
I represent the United States government.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.246
United States government?

07:25.327 --> 07:26.840
May I come in?

07:26.927 --> 07:28.838
- May he come in?
- Of course, sir.

07:28.927 --> 07:32.158
- Please do come in, Mr. Howard.
- Thank you.

07:32.247 --> 07:33.726
I'll be brief, Professor.

07:33.807 --> 07:37.117
I understand your destination is
the Orient, and you've been delayed.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.801
What if we could get you there,
but by a roundabout route,

07:39.887 --> 07:42.481
a cruise of three or four months
through the South Seas?

07:42.567 --> 07:47.163
- Would you accept?
- I would be interested, yes, naturally.

07:47.247 --> 07:48.521
Sit down.

07:48.607 --> 07:49.642
Thank you.

07:49.727 --> 07:51.922
I can see no reason
why you and your apprentice

07:52.007 --> 07:55.079
shouldn't consider yourselves
guests of the U.S. Government

07:55.167 --> 07:57.158
until we can set you ashore at Saigon.

07:57.247 --> 08:00.922
May I ask why have you honoured
the professor this way?

08:01.007 --> 08:02.440
The honour is ours.

08:02.527 --> 08:06.236
As the foremost authority on the sea,
you can be an excellent observer.

08:06.327 --> 08:09.285
Your observations will
influence public opinion.

08:09.367 --> 08:12.757
We can either confirm
or deny certain rumours.

08:12.847 --> 08:15.236
I knew it.
It concerns the monster.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.165
- Is that true?
- Very much so.

08:19.247 --> 08:21.966
According to the papers,
you seem to believe the rumours.

08:22.047 --> 08:24.641
No. The professor's been
misquoted outrageously.

08:24.727 --> 08:27.480
Yes, I'm afraid I was misquoted.

08:27.567 --> 08:30.035
However, I have an open mind
on the subject.

08:30.127 --> 08:32.561
All the better.
Your reports would be unbiased.

08:32.647 --> 08:37.083
You see, other nations, besides ours,
are forming expeditions.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.078
But I'd like to think
ours has the advantage,

08:39.167 --> 08:42.284
if for no other reason than
you might consent to join us.

08:42.366 --> 08:46.201
- That's very kind of you.
- We accept.

08:46.287 --> 08:47.436
Good.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.802
If you don't mind,
I'd like you to come downstairs

08:49.887 --> 08:51.206
and meet Captain Farragut.

08:51.287 --> 08:53.801
He's in command of the warship
upon which you're sailing.

08:53.887 --> 08:56.959
I might add that he has
some rather strong ideas

08:57.047 --> 08:59.242
on the subject of sea monsters.

08:59.327 --> 09:03.445
- You mean that his mind is not open?
- Most emphatically not.

09:08.207 --> 09:11.756
We headed south,
and excitement ran high.

09:11.847 --> 09:17.285
Every man aboard was on the lookout,
and the watch was kept day and night.

09:19.847 --> 09:22.156
Regardless of his own feelings
in the matter,

09:22.247 --> 09:25.637
Captain Farragut left nothing to chance.

09:25.727 --> 09:27.319
With traditional thoroughness,

09:27.407 --> 09:33.198
the Navy plan was to cut the South Pacific
into squares and search each square.

10:11.087 --> 10:13.555
For the first month, we steamed in circles,

10:13.647 --> 10:17.037
crossing and recrossing our course.

10:17.127 --> 10:19.197
There was no sign of our quarry.

10:26.047 --> 10:28.242
False alarms were common,

10:28.327 --> 10:31.125
and they didn't help our morale.

10:35.087 --> 10:37.203
Blow!

10:37.287 --> 10:40.120
Off the weather bow!

11:11.487 --> 11:16.607
For endless days and nights,
we scoured the South Pacific.

11:16.687 --> 11:20.282
Our hopes began to wane.

11:20.367 --> 11:21.880
It came as no surprise...

11:21.967 --> 11:26.199
when Captain Farragut
on the night of December 8, 1868,

11:26.287 --> 11:28.642
summoned us to the war room.

11:28.727 --> 11:33.164
Gentlemen, I believe my obligation
to this legend has been dispatched.

11:33.247 --> 11:35.238
I offer these charts in evidence.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.283
They represent an accurate record...

11:37.367 --> 11:39.437
of three and a half months
cruising under steam...

11:39.527 --> 11:41.438
in search of a sea monster.

11:41.527 --> 11:45.440
In my considered opinion, no such monster
exists or ever did.

11:45.527 --> 11:49.156
- Are you abandoning the search?
- There's no other choice, Professor.

11:49.247 --> 11:52.319
If we've gained nothing else, we can
at least give the lie to those rumours

11:52.407 --> 11:56.241
and make the newspapers
retract their exaggerations.

11:56.327 --> 11:59.842
It doesn't seem to me we have proved
anything one way or the other, Captain.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.919
I don't feel justified
in wasting further time.

12:03.007 --> 12:04.918
My decision stands.

12:05.007 --> 12:06.918
We'll set you ashore in Saigon.

12:07.007 --> 12:08.520
Gentlemen.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.958
Cheer up, Professor.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.123
You'll forget all about fishing
when you see the gals in Saigon.

12:22.207 --> 12:25.961
I thought they promised you a bonus
if you harpooned this monster, Mr Land.

12:26.047 --> 12:28.242
Knowing full well I couldn't collect it.

12:28.327 --> 12:31.046
When I get back, I'm shipping out
on the first whaler that'll take me.

12:31.127 --> 12:34.517
I won't get rich, but I won't be sitting
around, picking my teeth with my harpoon.

12:34.607 --> 12:37.201
Maybe we are lucky.
It might have sunk us.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.039
You scare me.

12:39.127 --> 12:43.120
Be a good loser, Professor. The fish
that got away is always the biggest one.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.201
What a pity, Professor.

12:46.287 --> 12:49.962
I know you had visions of that monster
mounted in the National Museum.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.562
Got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads

12:55.647 --> 12:57.285
A whale of a tale or two

12:57.367 --> 12:59.358
'Bout the flapping fish
And the girls I've loved

12:59.447 --> 13:01.563
On nights like this with the moon above

13:01.647 --> 13:03.478
A whale of a tale, and it's all true

13:03.567 --> 13:06.035
I swear by my tattoo

13:06.127 --> 13:08.641
There was Mermaid Minnie

13:08.727 --> 13:10.319
Met her down in Madagascar

13:10.407 --> 13:12.523
She would kiss me

13:12.607 --> 13:14.245
Anytime that I would ask her

13:14.327 --> 13:18.081
Then one evenin'
Her flame of love blew out

13:18.167 --> 13:20.078
Blow me down and pick me up

13:20.167 --> 13:21.361
She swapped me for a trout

13:21.447 --> 13:24.200
Got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads

13:24.287 --> 13:25.959
A whale of a tale or two

13:26.047 --> 13:28.003
'Bout the flappin' fish
And the girls I've loved

13:28.087 --> 13:30.123
On nights like this with the moon above

13:30.207 --> 13:32.038
A whale of a tale, and it's all true

13:32.127 --> 13:34.516
I swear by my tattoo

13:34.607 --> 13:37.041
There was Typhoon Tessie

13:37.127 --> 13:38.719
Met her on the coast of Java

13:38.807 --> 13:42.686
When we kissed
I bubbled up like molten lava

13:42.767 --> 13:46.726
Then she gave me
The scare of my young life

13:46.807 --> 13:48.684
Blow me down and pick me up

13:48.767 --> 13:50.325
She was the captain's wife

13:50.407 --> 13:52.796
Got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads

13:52.887 --> 13:54.559
A whale of a tale or two

13:54.647 --> 13:56.638
'Bout the flappin' fish
And the girls I've loved

13:56.727 --> 13:58.763
On nights like this with the moon above

13:58.847 --> 14:00.678
A whale of a tale, and it's all true

14:00.767 --> 14:03.235
I swear by my tattoo

14:08.287 --> 14:11.484
There was Harpoon Hannah

14:11.567 --> 14:13.876
Had a face that made you shudder

14:13.967 --> 14:16.401
Lips like fish hooks

14:16.487 --> 14:18.717
And a nose just like a rudder

14:19.447 --> 14:23.122
If I kissed her

14:23.207 --> 14:26.517
And held her tenderly

14:26.607 --> 14:31.123
Held her tenderly

14:31.207 --> 14:33.516
There's no sea monster big enough

14:33.607 --> 14:35.086
To ever frighten me

14:35.167 --> 14:37.442
Got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads

14:37.527 --> 14:39.199
A whale of a tale or two

14:39.287 --> 14:41.198
'Bout the flappin' fish
And the girls I've loved

14:41.287 --> 14:43.323
On nights like this with the moon above

14:43.407 --> 14:44.965
A whale of a tale, and it's all true

14:45.047 --> 14:48.323
I swear by my tattoo

14:49.847 --> 14:53.237
Ahoy! Ship off the starboard bow!

14:59.727 --> 15:03.197
Hard over! Head for that ship!

15:03.287 --> 15:06.165
Boatswain's mate, pipe all
hands to rescue stations.

15:06.247 --> 15:07.839
Aye aye, sir.

15:11.607 --> 15:14.405
All hands to rescue stations!

15:24.007 --> 15:26.965
I'm thinking she went down with all hands.

15:27.047 --> 15:28.560
Poor devils.

15:28.647 --> 15:30.842
Not a living soul left.

15:32.607 --> 15:35.201
What could have caused
such an fearsome explosion?

15:35.287 --> 15:38.518
Black powder and worse.
A whole shipload of the stuff.

15:38.607 --> 15:41.644
What could have set it off, though?
She must have struck something.

15:41.727 --> 15:44.002
Or could it be
that something struck the ship?

15:44.167 --> 15:46.078
What do you mean something struck her?

15:46.167 --> 15:50.206
- You meaning the monster, ain't ya, mate?
- Aye! It might be the monster.

15:50.287 --> 15:53.404
Monster? I've seen more monsters
in my Aunt Gussie's fishbowl

15:53.527 --> 15:54.801
than on this whole cruise.

15:54.887 --> 15:57.037
- Sure, it's the monster!
- It is the monster!

15:59.447 --> 16:01.005
Pipe down on deck!

16:01.087 --> 16:02.566
I must insist, Professor,

16:02.647 --> 16:05.081
that you keep
these fish stories to yourself.

16:05.167 --> 16:08.284
On deck, floating object
off the larboard quarter.

16:16.047 --> 16:17.526
There's the monster!

16:28.287 --> 16:30.847
Drummer boy, beat to general quarters.

16:49.767 --> 16:51.758
Set compressors and prime!

17:15.527 --> 17:18.564
Look alive there!
Get your range and fire. What's the matter?

17:18.847 --> 17:22.203
- She's showing us her heels, sir.
- Well, hit her in the heels. Fire!

17:22.406 --> 17:25.160
Aye aye, sir. Rudder out smartly.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.079
We hit her, sir! She's turning!

17:37.167 --> 17:38.964
She's turning around!

17:45.927 --> 17:48.487
Mr Land, into the longboat with you.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.762
Stand by to lower away.

18:31.887 --> 18:34.082
Professor! Hang on!

18:34.167 --> 18:35.759
Hang on!

18:54.167 --> 18:56.806
Hey, don't leave us! Help!

18:56.887 --> 18:58.878
Help!

18:58.967 --> 19:00.605
Help!

19:00.687 --> 19:03.997
They are disabled. They cannot help.

19:04.087 --> 19:06.920
But they must! Help!

19:07.087 --> 19:09.601
Help!

19:09.687 --> 19:12.076
Help!

19:21.647 --> 19:24.923
Can you see anything, anything at all?

19:25.007 --> 19:27.441
No. Wait till this fog lifts.

19:27.527 --> 19:29.961
I'm getting numb all over.

19:30.047 --> 19:34.325
Look, Professor.
There's something over there.

19:35.847 --> 19:39.999
- What is it?
- I don't know. It looks like the monster.

19:40.087 --> 19:43.875
I don't care what it is,
as long as it floats.

19:51.407 --> 19:55.719
Who could have conceived
such a miracle? A submarine boat.

19:55.807 --> 19:58.116
You mean a submerging boat?

19:58.207 --> 20:00.004
This is incredible.

20:00.087 --> 20:02.840
Men have dreamed about such miracles.

20:06.327 --> 20:09.842
You know something?
I don't like this at all.

20:11.727 --> 20:15.561
Ahoy! Is anyone aboard?

20:17.647 --> 20:21.560
It... It seems deserted.

20:21.647 --> 20:23.956
I think we are asking
for trouble, Professor.

20:24.047 --> 20:26.925
Why don't we wait?
Maybe somebody will come up.

20:27.007 --> 20:30.204
No. If we wait, this thing
is liable to sink under us.

20:31.127 --> 20:33.766
It's quite able to, you know.

20:40.887 --> 20:42.957
Hello.

20:43.047 --> 20:45.686
Is anyone down there?

20:54.287 --> 20:56.847
Why, it's as bright as day.

20:56.927 --> 20:59.919
And it isn't oil or gas either.

21:04.167 --> 21:08.877
- There is great genius behind all this.
- Yes, and great evil.

21:08.967 --> 21:12.801
Don't forget this is
an engine of destruction.

21:23.807 --> 21:25.365
Hello.

21:25.447 --> 21:27.642
Hello.

21:27.727 --> 21:30.287
Ahoy! Anybody there?

21:30.367 --> 21:33.598
Ahoy, there! Is anybody aboard?

21:33.687 --> 21:34.961
Did you hear that, Professor?

21:35.047 --> 21:36.958
Somebody's calling from the outside.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.880
- Come on.
- Wait.

21:39.967 --> 21:42.356
Look at this.

22:00.287 --> 22:03.245
Give me a hand with this line, mate.

22:03.327 --> 22:06.842
- Grab this oar.
- Why, Ned, it's you.

22:09.487 --> 22:13.036
- Anybody else get off?
- Yes, the professor is down below.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.481
Well, he really got his monster, didn't he?

22:17.567 --> 22:20.923
This ship seems deserted,
but I have a feeling not for too long.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.761
Personally, I'm in no mood
to meet the owners.

22:24.847 --> 22:27.486
I'm not anxious to get
in their company myself.

22:27.567 --> 22:29.637
I'll take my chances in the open sea.

22:29.727 --> 22:32.082
My sentiment exactly.
Let me call the professor.

22:32.167 --> 22:34.078
Give me a hand first. Grab that oar.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.681
We got to flop this over.

22:38.287 --> 22:40.278
Hold it.

23:18.047 --> 23:19.685
Big.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.285
I've never seen a barge like this before.

23:27.007 --> 23:29.123
Hey, this looks like the galley.

23:35.327 --> 23:39.878
- Cook's day off, too.
- Let me call the professor.

23:42.807 --> 23:45.162
Professor.

23:46.647 --> 23:48.239
Professor.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.125
Professor!

23:51.207 --> 23:53.198
Can you hear me?

23:55.447 --> 23:57.403
Professor.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.525
Professor.

24:07.127 --> 24:09.083
Professor.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.323
Professor.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.241
Professor, where are you?

24:23.327 --> 24:24.965
Hello. I'm in here.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.844
Where?

24:32.287 --> 24:36.075
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

24:36.167 --> 24:37.998
What is it?

24:38.087 --> 24:41.045
Burial ceremony under the sea.

25:09.727 --> 25:12.002
Ned Land is here with a boat.

25:12.087 --> 25:16.603
- Yes. That tall one must be the leader.
- They'll be coming back any moment.

26:32.927 --> 26:34.645
Get away!

26:34.727 --> 26:35.682
Help!

26:37.287 --> 26:39.278
Help!

27:11.767 --> 27:15.043
- Search the boat.
- Aye, sir. Come with me.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.598
Take him!

27:43.767 --> 27:45.758
Sink that longboat.

27:55.367 --> 27:57.927
Mind your shovin', mate.

28:17.927 --> 28:20.600
You are from the warship
that attacked me, are you not?

28:20.687 --> 28:23.326
We were under the impression
that this was a monster,

28:23.407 --> 28:26.160
not a craft of human invention.

28:26.247 --> 28:28.715
This is Ned Land, master harpooner.

28:28.807 --> 28:30.638
My apprentice, Conseil,

28:30.727 --> 28:33.878
and I am Pierre Aronnax
of the Paris National Museum.

28:33.967 --> 28:37.323
Professor Aronnax.

28:37.407 --> 28:40.524
I've heard of you
and studied your writings.

28:40.607 --> 28:42.996
It is fortunate that
your background differs slightly

28:43.087 --> 28:45.157
from that of your companions in crime.

28:45.247 --> 28:48.045
You may remain.
Take the others on deck.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.800
Wait a minute.
What are you gonna do with us on deck?

28:50.887 --> 28:53.560
I did not invite you.
You came as an enemy to destroy me.

28:53.647 --> 28:55.717
That is not true.
They've done no harm.

28:55.807 --> 28:58.560
Don't blame us because
the warship shelled you.

28:58.647 --> 29:00.877
- I demand a fair trial.
- You've had your trial.

29:00.967 --> 29:04.403
The sea brought you.
The sea shall have you back.

29:04.487 --> 29:08.162
Mind your shovin'! Easy, mate!

29:08.247 --> 29:11.284
But you cannot do this.
This is not civilised.

29:11.367 --> 29:14.564
I'm not what is called
a civilised man, Professor.

29:14.647 --> 29:18.162
I have done with society
for reasons that seem good to me.

29:18.247 --> 29:20.807
Therefore, I do not obey its laws.

29:20.887 --> 29:22.923
But I am as guilty as they are.

29:25.647 --> 29:28.366
I will grant you
that both of them and me, too,

29:28.447 --> 29:31.245
enlisted to track down
what we thought to be a monster.

29:31.327 --> 29:33.795
But we are no more guilty
than the rest of the world.

29:33.887 --> 29:36.276
I would consider that guilty enough.

29:40.527 --> 29:43.917
You have a great deal
to learn, Professor.

29:44.007 --> 29:46.396
Your book is brilliant,

29:46.487 --> 29:49.001
but it lacks scope.

29:49.087 --> 29:54.445
You've carried your work as far
as terrestrial science permits.

29:54.527 --> 29:59.601
The real story of the ocean depths
begins where you left off,

29:59.687 --> 30:04.124
wonders that defy
my powers of description.

30:04.207 --> 30:07.324
The secrets that are mine alone,

30:07.407 --> 30:09.682
but which I would be
willing to share with you.

30:11.327 --> 30:13.761
At the expense of my companions' lives?

30:13.847 --> 30:17.840
I'm sorry. You'd have
to choose between them and me.

30:20.047 --> 30:22.083
Then I cannot accept.

30:24.527 --> 30:27.087
Professor, I regret your choice.

30:29.247 --> 30:30.999
Take him up!

30:32.127 --> 30:34.766
- And secure for sea.
- Aye, sir.

30:51.967 --> 30:56.040
- All stations ready! Prepare for diving.
- Yes, sir.

30:56.127 --> 30:58.721
All stations ready. Prepare for diving.

31:07.927 --> 31:09.645
Ahead slow.

31:10.727 --> 31:14.720
- What's he up to, Professor?
- I don't know.

31:21.687 --> 31:23.962
Trim your forward ballast.

31:24.047 --> 31:25.196
Three degrees down.

31:25.447 --> 31:27.881
Three degrees down.

31:54.087 --> 31:56.555
All engines stop! Surface and stand by.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.763
- Pick up those two men in the water.
- What about the other one?

32:04.847 --> 32:08.601
Take them all below
and confine them to quarters.

32:08.687 --> 32:11.599
I found out what I wanted to know.

32:35.247 --> 32:38.523
Esmie. There. There.

32:38.607 --> 32:40.677
There. Now, kiss.

32:42.847 --> 32:46.556
Now, off you go, Esmie.
Come in, gentlemen.

32:48.327 --> 32:50.045
Be seated, please.

32:50.127 --> 32:51.845
Thank you.

32:57.287 --> 32:59.198
Professor.

33:00.487 --> 33:02.239
You may serve them.

33:02.327 --> 33:05.637
Your clothes are being dried
and will be returned to you shortly.

33:05.727 --> 33:08.844
In the meantime, avail yourselves
of my humble hospitality.

33:08.927 --> 33:10.246
Humble, he calls it.

33:10.327 --> 33:14.161
- You do right well for yourself, mate.
- You may call me Captain Nemo.

33:14.247 --> 33:18.479
I'd like to express our gratitude, Captain.
We are grateful to be alive.

33:18.567 --> 33:21.843
I want none of your gratitude.
You're all on strict probation,

33:21.927 --> 33:24.839
and I'd advise you not to attempt escape.

33:24.927 --> 33:27.043
You understand your position?

33:27.127 --> 33:29.641
I don't know.
A prisoner has the right to escape.

33:29.727 --> 33:32.446
- That is correct.
- And a guest don't need to.

33:32.527 --> 33:36.600
I guess that makes us
a little bit of both.

33:36.687 --> 33:39.884
Consider that a fortunate
compromise then, Mr Land.

33:39.967 --> 33:42.242
I tolerate no guests
aboard the Nautilus,

33:42.327 --> 33:44.443
and you already know
the fate of prisoners.

33:48.207 --> 33:50.323
The food is delicious,
isn't it, Professor?

33:50.407 --> 33:53.365
Oh, very good. Never tasted better.

33:53.447 --> 33:57.520
There's a fork on your left, Mr Land,
or aren't you accustomed to utensils?

33:58.887 --> 34:01.117
I'm indifferent to 'em.

34:02.847 --> 34:06.476
May I ask how you are able
to set such a table as this, Captain?

34:06.567 --> 34:09.081
These dishes come entirely
from my ocean kitchen.

34:09.167 --> 34:11.158
There is nothing here of the earth.

34:11.246 --> 34:14.637
How remarkable. This tastes like veal.

34:14.726 --> 34:18.402
The flavour deceives you.
That is fillet of sea snake.

34:22.847 --> 34:25.407
I suppose this isn't lamb, then.

34:25.487 --> 34:29.764
That is brisket of glow fish with
sea squirt dressing basted in barnacles.

34:32.367 --> 34:33.925
It's very good.

34:34.007 --> 34:37.362
In fact, it's better than lamb.

34:37.447 --> 34:41.042
My cook excels in preparing
these various products.

34:41.127 --> 34:42.799
You're not finished, are you?

34:42.887 --> 34:45.196
Well, just the main course.

34:45.286 --> 34:47.801
Pass the cream, mate.

34:48.967 --> 34:53.199
The cream is, of course,
milk from the giant sperm whale.

34:53.286 --> 34:58.520
And those delicious fruits are actually
preserves made from sea cucumbers.

34:58.607 --> 35:03.203
Well, I'd never have guessed it.
They are excellent.

35:04.087 --> 35:05.679
Eat your pudding, Mr Land.

35:06.287 --> 35:08.847
I ain't sure it's puddin'.

35:12.767 --> 35:14.200
What is it?

35:14.287 --> 35:18.246
It's my own recipe,
sauté of unborn octopus.

35:20.887 --> 35:23.845
Nothing here's fit to eat!
Sauté of unborn octopus.

35:23.927 --> 35:26.043
Since we are nearing
the island of Crespo,

35:26.127 --> 35:29.278
you'll have an opportunity
of selecting your own food.

35:30.287 --> 35:32.642
You mean, we're getting off
this submarine?

35:32.727 --> 35:35.764
For a brief hunting expedition.

35:35.847 --> 35:39.203
- Well, that suits me fine.
- Me, too.

35:39.287 --> 35:41.960
- When do we start, mate... Captain?
- Almost immediately.

35:42.047 --> 35:44.481
These two will join the expedition.
Prepare them.

35:44.567 --> 35:46.159
Aye, sir.

35:54.567 --> 35:57.843
- Accept one of these cigars, Professor.
- Thank you.

36:10.287 --> 36:12.881
Delightful smoke.

36:12.967 --> 36:15.527
Different somehow. Havana?

36:16.527 --> 36:18.836
Seaweed.

36:20.287 --> 36:23.563
I cannot accuse you of
not making us comfortable, Captain.

36:23.647 --> 36:27.765
In a way, though, I feel like a condemned
man who has eaten his last dinner,

36:27.847 --> 36:29.803
and a very good one, too.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.843
Thank you.

36:31.927 --> 36:36.000
I am still curious as to the reason
you spared our lives.

36:36.087 --> 36:39.363
In your case, I wanted to test
your loyalty to your companions.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.678
I may have use
for such misplaced devotion.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.086
Misplaced?

36:44.167 --> 36:47.125
It comforts me to know that your life
was not too dear a price to pay

36:47.207 --> 36:49.721
for the love of your fellow man.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.365
I'm afraid I don't understand.

36:51.447 --> 36:54.200
At the moment, I don't
intend that you should.

36:54.287 --> 36:56.323
But I may have use for you.

36:56.407 --> 36:59.365
Until I make up my mind,
you should find ample diversion here.

36:59.447 --> 37:02.120
You have literature,

37:02.207 --> 37:05.597
art treasures, my collections,

37:06.247 --> 37:09.239
and even music, if you so desire.

37:19.647 --> 37:22.445
We're almost at the island of Crespo.

37:24.007 --> 37:25.998
All this was once an island.

37:26.087 --> 37:28.999
Although it is now sunk,
it is nonetheless fertile.

37:29.087 --> 37:32.079
- We do our hunting and farming here.
- Underwater?

37:32.167 --> 37:35.159
The sea supplies all my wants.

37:35.407 --> 37:39.116
Fine way to go huntin'.
I knew there'd be a catch to this.

37:39.207 --> 37:42.643
Seems you can't do anything
on this boat without getting wet.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.843
I feel like I'm keeping
a fish out of work.

37:47.527 --> 37:49.882
Wait a minute.
Where you going with this?

37:49.967 --> 37:52.276
What are you gonna do with that?

39:07.007 --> 39:09.760
An expedition from the Nautilus.

39:11.287 --> 39:14.916
The pair you see trying
to keep pace are your companions.

39:16.047 --> 39:19.278
It's a new experience for them.
They'll learn quickly.

39:28.807 --> 39:31.879
- Would you like to join them?
- Indeed, yes!

39:31.967 --> 39:34.197
I would like to meet
these wonders face to face.

39:34.287 --> 39:37.279
Very well.
I'll introduce them to you.

41:07.367 --> 41:10.723
A strange twilight world
opened up before me

41:10.807 --> 41:14.595
and I felt as the first man
to set foot on another planet,

41:14.687 --> 41:18.396
an intruder in this mystic
garden of the deep.

41:45.687 --> 41:48.281
Captain Nemo and I were not alone.

41:48.367 --> 41:51.245
There were hunters and farmers
from the submarine,

41:51.327 --> 41:54.000
gathering a harvest
at the bottom of the sea.

41:58.927 --> 42:01.839
I could only marvel at his ingenuity

42:01.927 --> 42:05.715
and envy him his rule over
this forgotten reach of nature.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.480
He had an abundance
of various substances

42:31.567 --> 42:33.523
necessary to sustain life.

42:33.607 --> 42:36.804
An underwater larder
filled to overflowing,

42:36.887 --> 42:39.879
and all Captain Nemo for the taking.

46:39.807 --> 46:43.163
I can't believe that!
Captain, we left a treasure out there!

46:43.247 --> 46:45.397
A chest of gold, silver and diamonds!

46:45.487 --> 46:48.524
You were sent to get food, not treasure.
You can't eat pieces of eight.

46:48.607 --> 46:49.835
I can eat anytime!

46:49.927 --> 46:52.646
You place an absurd value on
the cheapest of human commodities.

46:52.727 --> 46:55.525
Aboard the Nautilus, we use
such baubles for ballast.

47:00.967 --> 47:03.003
Ballast?

47:06.727 --> 47:08.638
Well, I could sure lighten this ship.

47:08.727 --> 47:14.404
The greatest treasures of all, Mr Land,
lie in a sound mind and a full belly.

47:14.487 --> 47:17.399
Henceforth, when you're sent for food,
don't stoop to pick up pennies.

47:17.487 --> 47:21.480
You've been picking them up,
and picking them up good. Ballast!

47:21.567 --> 47:23.762
- Ned, you forget yourself.
- Don't try my patience.

47:23.847 --> 47:29.126
Rather than watch your every move, I know
a much easier solution to the problem.

47:29.207 --> 47:31.562
Crying waste!

47:42.927 --> 47:45.885
Ned, the professor wants to see you.

47:45.967 --> 47:47.161
Yeah?

47:47.247 --> 47:49.238
Close the door, please.

47:51.047 --> 47:54.198
Don't think for a minute
that was an empty threat he made.

47:54.287 --> 47:57.882
You are going to get us all killed
if you keep antagonising him.

47:57.967 --> 48:00.083
Look at the trouble you got into
wandering off that way.

48:00.167 --> 48:04.524
- Why did you do it?
- Ask him. He went with me.

48:04.607 --> 48:08.395
That was scientific interest.
I had no idea he was after treasure.

48:08.487 --> 48:10.398
Oh, no?

48:10.487 --> 48:12.557
You even helped carry the chest out,
you liar.

48:12.647 --> 48:15.161
We mustn't quarrel among ourselves.
We must stay together.

48:15.247 --> 48:17.203
- It's our only chance.
- Chance? For what?

48:17.287 --> 48:21.485
I know what you want, Professor.
This crazy iron skillet's turned your head.

48:21.567 --> 48:24.479
You want to play a waiting game,
hoping to learn Nemo's secrets.

48:24.567 --> 48:27.001
I believe we owe the world
that much, Ned.

48:27.087 --> 48:29.442
- Have you a better plan?
- Yeah.

48:29.527 --> 48:31.119
I want to get off.

48:31.207 --> 48:33.516
Of course I don't mind
going with my pockets full.

48:33.607 --> 48:35.598
I can't believe
you could be so foolish.

48:35.687 --> 48:38.076
Why not? He's got a king's ransom
aboard here.

48:38.167 --> 48:40.761
Don't call it stealing,
because that's the way he got it.

48:40.847 --> 48:43.236
If we could take this thing over,
we'd be rich.

48:43.327 --> 48:45.079
I'd have a ship of me own,

48:45.167 --> 48:47.806
and you wouldn't have to be starving
on a professor's pay.

48:47.887 --> 48:50.242
Don't look at me with
those soft-boiled eggs.

48:50.327 --> 48:54.843
I caught the grin of gold in them
when that chest busted.

48:54.927 --> 48:56.963
Ned, listen to me.

48:57.047 --> 48:59.322
I want you to forget this idea.

48:59.407 --> 49:02.001
Promise me that you won't start
anything on your own.

49:02.087 --> 49:04.237
I won't promise that, Professor.

49:04.327 --> 49:06.682
At least try my way first.

49:06.767 --> 49:11.204
I know I can win the captain's confidence,
but I need time, and I need your help.

49:11.287 --> 49:13.278
Can I count on you?

49:14.367 --> 49:17.359
All right. Well, I go this far.

49:17.447 --> 49:20.120
I won't try any one-man mutiny. Yet.

49:20.207 --> 49:22.163
It is the best way, believe me.

49:22.247 --> 49:25.603
There's one thing you ought
to know, Professor.

49:25.687 --> 49:27.564
Nemo's cracked.

49:27.647 --> 49:30.639
I've yet to see the day you can
make a deal with a mad dog.

49:30.727 --> 49:35.084
So while you're feeding him sugar,
I'll be figuring a plan to muzzle him.

49:39.847 --> 49:41.246
Fool.

49:41.327 --> 49:44.603
He simply cannot grasp
the significance of all this.

49:44.687 --> 49:48.043
Here we are within reach of
the most fabulous discoveries of all time,

49:48.127 --> 49:50.595
and he patters of gold, escape.

49:50.687 --> 49:53.281
Trivialities. Nonsense.

49:53.367 --> 49:57.804
- That depends on your point of view.
- What do you mean by that?

49:57.887 --> 50:01.516
I just think that Ned values his life
above scientific achievement.

50:01.607 --> 50:03.643
His life means nothing.

50:03.727 --> 50:07.083
Nor does mine or yours,
compared to what's behind all this.

50:07.167 --> 50:09.681
We can't have him crossing Nemo.

50:29.927 --> 50:33.522
Today we encountered
a fearsome storm.

50:33.607 --> 50:36.644
An ordinary vessel
would have suffered heavy damage.

50:36.727 --> 50:38.558
Safe and serene,

50:38.647 --> 50:41.605
the Nautilus cruised
beneath the tempest.

51:47.207 --> 51:49.038
There was much to occupy me,

51:49.127 --> 51:53.643
so I left my apprentice
to deal with Ned Land.

51:53.727 --> 51:56.287
Although he had
apparently settled down,

51:56.367 --> 51:59.484
I knew he bore
constant watching.

52:45.407 --> 52:47.875
Aye, sir, I'll check
all decks below.

52:57.607 --> 53:00.201
Got a whale of a tale to tell you, boys

53:00.287 --> 53:01.436
A whale of a tale that's true

53:01.527 --> 53:03.006
'Bout the flappin' fish
And the girls I've loved

53:03.087 --> 53:05.681
On nights like this
With the moon above

53:08.287 --> 53:09.925
Cute, isn't she?

53:24.527 --> 53:26.483
As the voyage continued,

53:26.567 --> 53:29.035
the Nautilus and its motive power

53:29.127 --> 53:31.766
excited my utmost curiosity.

53:31.847 --> 53:35.886
At my host's invitation,
I inspected the ship.

53:35.967 --> 53:39.004
He seemed determined
to show me everything.

53:40.687 --> 53:43.599
We went to the very
heart of the vessel,

53:43.687 --> 53:45.678
the propulsion unit.

54:16.767 --> 54:19.679
It was apparent that Captain Nemo
had discovered

54:19.767 --> 54:21.997
what mankind has always sought,

54:22.087 --> 54:25.397
the veritable dynamic
power of the universe.

54:25.487 --> 54:29.321
This secret alone gave him
mastery of the sea.

54:32.767 --> 54:35.156
I can hardly believe it,

54:35.247 --> 54:38.045
how one could conceive
and build such a craft.

54:38.127 --> 54:39.879
And in a single stroke,

54:39.967 --> 54:44.199
harness power beyond
the wildest dreams of science.

54:44.287 --> 54:47.996
Why, such a secret could
revolutionise the world.

54:48.087 --> 54:50.043
Or destroy it.

55:01.366 --> 55:04.722
See how peaceful it is here.

55:04.806 --> 55:07.445
The sea is everything,

55:07.526 --> 55:11.758
an immense reservoir of nature
where I roam at will.

55:11.846 --> 55:13.677
With seeming indifference,

55:13.766 --> 55:16.963
Captain Nemo held the key
to the future of the world.

55:17.046 --> 55:18.684
As I studied him,

55:18.766 --> 55:23.044
I became aware that powerful forces
were at work within this strange man.

55:25.766 --> 55:27.438
Think of it.

55:27.526 --> 55:30.404
On the surface, there is hunger and fear.

55:30.486 --> 55:34.479
Men still exercise unjust laws.

55:34.566 --> 55:38.354
They fight, tear one another to pieces.

55:39.566 --> 55:44.162
A mere few feet beneath the waves,
their reign ceases,

55:44.246 --> 55:47.363
their evil drowns.

55:47.446 --> 55:52.600
Here on the ocean floor
is the only independence.

55:52.686 --> 55:55.041
Here I am free.

55:57.566 --> 56:00.205
Imagine what would happen
if they controlled machines

56:00.286 --> 56:02.925
such as a submarine boat.

56:03.006 --> 56:06.316
Far better that they think
there's a monster

56:06.406 --> 56:08.795
and hunt me with harpoons.

56:11.926 --> 56:15.441
After travelling 10,000 leagues
under the sea,

56:15.526 --> 56:18.996
I still had not solved
the mystery of Captain Nemo.

56:19.086 --> 56:21.998
But then one day he asked me
to go ashore with him.

56:22.086 --> 56:25.237
I felt at long last
I was to have my answer.

56:37.926 --> 56:41.714
The prison camp of Rorapandi,
the white man's grave.

56:41.806 --> 56:43.797
I thought it had been abolished.

56:43.886 --> 56:47.435
Nothing is abolished that turns
a profit to that hated nation.

56:49.046 --> 56:51.514
You'll see better
what I mean through this.

56:55.206 --> 56:57.720
What is in those sacks
they are carrying?

56:57.806 --> 57:01.845
Nitrates and phosphate
for ammunition, the seeds of war.

57:01.926 --> 57:04.440
They're loading a full cargo of death,

57:04.526 --> 57:09.520
and when that ship takes it home,
the world will die a little more.

57:11.006 --> 57:14.999
I was once one of those
pitiful wretches you see down there.

57:16.606 --> 57:18.039
Look at it again.

57:18.126 --> 57:21.516
I don't want you to forget
what you've seen here today.

57:22.806 --> 57:24.683
I've seen enough.

57:27.166 --> 57:30.522
It's burned everlastingly in my memory.

57:38.966 --> 57:42.356
I did not escape from there alone.

57:42.446 --> 57:45.404
There were others, and most
of them are still with me.

57:45.486 --> 57:47.716
The crew of the Nautilus?

57:47.806 --> 57:50.843
They are dedicated men
with a plan for living,

57:50.926 --> 57:54.282
but also a plan for dying.

57:54.366 --> 57:58.518
We seized one of their ships
and fled beyond maps,

57:58.606 --> 58:02.042
a place known to me simply as Vulcania.

58:02.126 --> 58:05.243
Vulcania? It sounds remote.

58:05.326 --> 58:06.998
Remote and useful.

58:07.086 --> 58:09.725
It was there that we built the Nautilus.

58:09.806 --> 58:13.116
You will have the privilege
of seeing all this firsthand.

58:13.206 --> 58:16.915
When our mission is completed,
the Nautilus is going home.

58:28.526 --> 58:30.835
They're getting up steam, sir.

58:32.126 --> 58:34.276
Very good.

58:34.366 --> 58:38.041
That ship that flies no flag
sails with the tide.

58:38.126 --> 58:41.562
But the evil in its hold
will never reach its destination.

58:41.646 --> 58:43.716
- You have your orders.
- Aye, sir.

58:43.806 --> 58:45.876
- Go to your stations.
- Go below, Professor.

58:47.406 --> 58:50.204
- You are going to sink that ship?
- I said go below!

58:50.286 --> 58:52.277
Stay in your quarters!

01:00:35.526 --> 01:00:37.084
Stand by engines.

01:00:39.566 --> 01:00:41.397
Half ahead.

01:01:00.126 --> 01:01:02.879
Collision speed, full!

01:01:02.966 --> 01:01:04.843
Collision speed, full!

01:02:23.366 --> 01:02:24.481
Professor?

01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:27.444
Are you all right?

01:02:27.526 --> 01:02:30.836
All those men,
they didn't even have a chance.

01:02:32.806 --> 01:02:35.718
They were sailors, same as me,

01:02:35.806 --> 01:02:39.845
slaughtered by that monster
you're trying to make friends with.

01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:41.644
Ned, don't.

01:02:41.726 --> 01:02:43.842
I don't know how you feel, Professor,

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:46.918
but I feel like a knife that's just
stabbed a friend in the back.

01:02:47.006 --> 01:02:48.598
Go to your quarters.

01:02:49.846 --> 01:02:52.201
I've had a bellyful.

01:02:53.326 --> 01:02:54.725
Damage report, sir.

01:02:54.806 --> 01:02:57.081
Rudder and starboard
diving planes disabled.

01:02:57.166 --> 01:03:00.476
Muster a repair party.
We'll make temporary repairs here.

01:03:00.566 --> 01:03:02.443
Aye, sir.

01:03:06.046 --> 01:03:09.197
I asked you to leave, Professor.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.356
You also asked me ashore,

01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:14.279
to show me man's inhumanity to man.

01:03:14.366 --> 01:03:17.517
Why? To justify this?

01:03:17.606 --> 01:03:20.723
You are not only a murderer.
You are a hypocrite.

01:03:20.806 --> 01:03:24.242
The proof lies out there.

01:03:24.326 --> 01:03:28.160
You call that murder?
Well, I see murder, too!

01:03:28.246 --> 01:03:30.282
Not written on those
drowned faces out there,

01:03:30.366 --> 01:03:33.438
but on the faces of dead thousands!

01:03:33.526 --> 01:03:36.996
There are the assassins,
the dealers in death. I am the avenger.

01:03:40.166 --> 01:03:44.478
Is murder a right reserved
for that hated nation

01:03:44.566 --> 01:03:47.126
that has taken everything from me?
Everything but my secret,

01:03:47.206 --> 01:03:49.640
the secret of my submarine boat
and the energy that propels it.

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:53.844
They tried. They cast me into prison,
and when they failed...

01:03:59.526 --> 01:04:01.562
When they failed,

01:04:01.646 --> 01:04:04.922
they tortured my wife
and young son to death.

01:04:14.486 --> 01:04:18.604
Do you know the meaning
of love, Professor?

01:04:18.686 --> 01:04:20.881
I believe I do.

01:04:20.966 --> 01:04:26.120
What you fail to understand
is the power of hate.

01:04:26.206 --> 01:04:30.757
It can fill the heart as surely as love can.

01:04:32.046 --> 01:04:34.037
I'm sorry for you.

01:04:35.286 --> 01:04:37.197
It's a bitter substitute.

01:04:59.046 --> 01:05:02.163
The explosions scattered
everything all over the place.

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:04.282
I was just trying to tidy up.

01:05:07.086 --> 01:05:10.635
- Professor, I'd like to speak to you.
- About what?

01:05:10.726 --> 01:05:14.765
Well, I believe things
have gone far enough.

01:05:14.846 --> 01:05:17.838
Murder means nothing to him.
I think he enjoys it.

01:05:17.926 --> 01:05:19.962
You're sure of that, are you?

01:05:20.046 --> 01:05:21.559
Quite sure?

01:05:21.646 --> 01:05:24.683
I can only judge him
by what I've observed.

01:05:24.766 --> 01:05:28.395
It is not your place to judge.
You don't know anything about the captain.

01:05:30.366 --> 01:05:32.402
He's already said
that he has use for me.

01:05:32.486 --> 01:05:34.795
What's more important,
the world has a use for him.

01:05:34.886 --> 01:05:37.002
And I must make him understand it.

01:05:37.086 --> 01:05:42.365
When he does, he will judge himself
far more harshly than you ever can.

01:05:42.446 --> 01:05:44.243
Is that clear?

01:05:44.326 --> 01:05:46.078
Whatever you say, Captain.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:49.397
Now, please go out and leave me alone.

01:05:52.646 --> 01:05:55.956
What did you call me? "Captain?"

01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:57.718
Yes, I did.

01:05:57.806 --> 01:06:00.798
And I must say,
there is a certain resemblance.

01:06:13.406 --> 01:06:16.478
- Seen enough?
- I want to talk to you.

01:06:16.566 --> 01:06:21.117
You little spying hyena.
Did the professor put you up to this?

01:06:21.206 --> 01:06:23.117
It's the professor
I want to tell you about!

01:06:23.206 --> 01:06:26.721
You were right.
Nemo's won him over completely.

01:06:26.806 --> 01:06:29.604
You bet I was right.
And I was right about you spying on me.

01:06:29.686 --> 01:06:33.315
I've known all along
that you were stealing food and treasure.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:37.194
I didn't tell a soul.
I was glad you did it. We may need it.

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:39.197
We? Since when do I need you?

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:43.438
We need each other.
Ned, I want to be friends.

01:06:43.526 --> 01:06:47.405
"I wanna be friends."
I want to escape.

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:49.204
So do I, with you.

01:06:49.286 --> 01:06:52.278
And we have to save the professor
in spite of himself.

01:06:52.366 --> 01:06:56.439
You once said you had a plan.
Well, have you?

01:06:56.526 --> 01:06:59.359
- Yeah, I got a plan.
- Well?

01:06:59.446 --> 01:07:01.357
Trouble is, it won't work.

01:07:01.446 --> 01:07:03.562
I can't figure how they
navigate this barge.

01:07:03.646 --> 01:07:07.002
Nothing's written down.
No courses, no bearings, nothing.

01:07:07.086 --> 01:07:09.964
If we could figure where
we're heading, we'd have a chance.

01:07:10.046 --> 01:07:11.445
That's no problem.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:15.314
When I was reading the professor's journal,
I learned about Nemo's plans.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:19.285
We're heading
for a place called Vulcania.

01:07:19.366 --> 01:07:22.597
- Vulcania?
- Yeah, that's Nemo's base.

01:07:22.686 --> 01:07:26.281
Why didn't you say so?
This is what I've been waiting for!

01:07:26.366 --> 01:07:27.799
- It was?
- Sure!

01:07:27.966 --> 01:07:29.604
Vulcania!

01:07:29.686 --> 01:07:32.598
I got to take a look at those charts.

01:07:34.126 --> 01:07:35.718
Why not?

01:07:46.406 --> 01:07:48.158
I'll need all hands.

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:50.396
- You keep a watch.
- Aye, sir.

01:08:10.766 --> 01:08:14.600
- Keep your eye peeled for the mate.
- Aye, sir.

01:08:47.366 --> 01:08:49.277
Hey, Ned.

01:08:49.366 --> 01:08:51.960
Ned, put them back. He's coming.

01:08:57.406 --> 01:08:59.555
All right, all right!

01:08:59.645 --> 01:09:02.444
Hurry up. Hurry up, he's coming!

01:09:26.566 --> 01:09:28.078
That was close, mate.

01:09:28.166 --> 01:09:29.997
Very.

01:09:33.446 --> 01:09:37.121
- This is Nemo's cabin.
- Yeah.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.640
He does do right well for himself.

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:43.676
Maybe...

01:09:46.486 --> 01:09:49.523
Let's get out of here.
If they find us in his cabin, we're...

01:09:51.366 --> 01:09:53.595
- What is it?
- Get me a pencil and paper quick.

01:09:53.685 --> 01:09:56.723
- What for?
- I think I found something.

01:09:57.726 --> 01:09:59.125
Yes?

01:10:01.126 --> 01:10:04.641
See? All the distances
are measured from that point.

01:10:04.726 --> 01:10:06.125
That's right.

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:33.040
Get me those calipers, quick.

01:10:33.126 --> 01:10:36.721
Let me see if I can work this out.
Now, longitude...

01:10:39.166 --> 01:10:40.394
- Quiet!
- Quiet.

01:10:44.086 --> 01:10:46.680
Here. Here. Have a cigar.

01:10:46.766 --> 01:10:48.199
Hey, she likes 'em!

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:52.279
- You want another? Give me a kiss.
- You have quite a way with animals.

01:10:52.366 --> 01:10:54.243
I do better with women.

01:10:54.326 --> 01:10:55.441
Be quiet!

01:10:55.526 --> 01:10:57.164
- You feed her.
- All right.

01:10:57.246 --> 01:11:00.682
I'll give you a cigar. All right.
Here. Have one.

01:11:22.286 --> 01:11:25.961
Yes, I love you, too.
I'll find you some more.

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.322
- Stop playing with her!
- I'm not playing!

01:11:31.646 --> 01:11:34.399
You just be quiet. Be a nice girl.

01:11:34.486 --> 01:11:37.558
Now, eat them slowly.
You don't have to be needy.

01:11:47.846 --> 01:11:50.918
- We'll complete repairs at base.
- He's coming.

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:52.359
Let's go.

01:11:52.446 --> 01:11:56.121
- Resume speed at 50 fathoms.
- Resume speed at 50 fathoms.

01:12:07.206 --> 01:12:08.685
Esmie.

01:12:12.206 --> 01:12:15.084
I've got to do some research.
I'll need some specimens. Get 'em.

01:12:15.166 --> 01:12:18.556
- Specimens? What kind?
- The ones in bottles. Go on. Beat it.

01:12:18.646 --> 01:12:21.558
- And don't get caught.
- No.

01:12:30.126 --> 01:12:33.880
Ned, you've got everything here,
from the rarest nudibranchs to oysters.

01:12:33.966 --> 01:12:38.118
Oysters are out of season.
Dump 'em in the sink. I want the bottles.

01:12:38.206 --> 01:12:41.915
You can't do that.
These are priceless.

01:12:42.006 --> 01:12:45.237
You're not thinking of putting
messages into these bottles?

01:12:45.326 --> 01:12:48.204
Why, that went out with Robinson Crusoe.

01:12:48.286 --> 01:12:51.483
You've forgotten this is the 19th century.

01:12:51.566 --> 01:12:53.636
Somethin' else I forgot.

01:12:56.486 --> 01:12:58.477
That's for spyin' on me.

01:12:58.566 --> 01:13:02.115
Don't let me catch you padding the shadow
of my stern again. Remember that.

01:13:05.366 --> 01:13:08.483
I don't like bashin' anybody,
but you had it comin', lad.

01:13:09.806 --> 01:13:12.001
And I thought we were friends.

01:13:12.966 --> 01:13:14.843
Sure we're friends!

01:13:14.926 --> 01:13:18.441
Go ahead. Hit me.
Hit me.

01:13:18.526 --> 01:13:21.120
- You mean that?
- Sure, go ahead. You can't miss it.

01:13:25.006 --> 01:13:27.440
Now we are friends.

01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:30.802
Oh, all right, shipmate!

01:13:30.886 --> 01:13:33.923
Now I'll tell you what I had in my mind.

01:13:34.006 --> 01:13:37.237
This may be old stuff... tossing messages
in bottles and settin' 'em adrift...

01:13:37.326 --> 01:13:39.601
but I've heard of it workin'.

01:13:40.646 --> 01:13:42.762
- Alcohol.
- Very pure alcohol.

01:13:42.846 --> 01:13:46.122
We'll just drain the polliwogs out
and save the grog.

01:13:48.766 --> 01:13:50.996
It's priceless.

01:13:53.766 --> 01:13:56.564
Anyhow... hold this, lad.

01:13:56.646 --> 01:13:59.114
This chap I knew got shipwrecked
in the Bahamas.

01:13:59.206 --> 01:14:02.721
Him and a lady passenger
alone on an island.

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:04.956
Well, they had plenty
of time on their hands,

01:14:05.046 --> 01:14:06.718
so they began writin' notes,

01:14:06.806 --> 01:14:09.764
puttin' 'em in old rum bottles
and settin' 'em adrift.

01:14:09.846 --> 01:14:12.314
One of them got through
and they was rescued.

01:14:18.846 --> 01:14:21.201
What's the matter?

01:14:23.486 --> 01:14:26.558
I swallowed it.

01:14:26.646 --> 01:14:30.116
There was a Flabellina oculina in there.

01:14:30.206 --> 01:14:31.878
Poor thing.

01:14:35.646 --> 01:14:37.557
Flabellina oculina.

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:29.964
She won't answer her helm, sir.

01:15:33.446 --> 01:15:35.880
Astern, full!

01:15:44.726 --> 01:15:47.365
- What's happened?
- We seem to have run aground.

01:15:47.446 --> 01:15:49.277
What's happened?

01:15:49.366 --> 01:15:52.119
- An accident, Captain?
- An incident.

01:15:52.206 --> 01:15:55.801
Our faulty rudder's put us on a reef.
The tide will float us free by evening.

01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:58.844
We're off the coast of New Guinea.
Would you like to go ashore?

01:15:58.926 --> 01:16:02.965
No, thank you. The last time we went
ashore, it was a prelude to murder.

01:16:04.606 --> 01:16:06.597
- Check for leaks.
- Aye, sir.

01:16:10.686 --> 01:16:13.200
Throwin' away a chance like that.

01:16:13.286 --> 01:16:15.242
The professor's losin' his ballast.

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:27.155
Smell it. Sweet as an angel's kiss.

01:16:28.446 --> 01:16:32.883
Dry land, mate.
Coconuts, mangoes and...

01:16:32.966 --> 01:16:36.595
native girls hungry for affection.

01:16:36.686 --> 01:16:38.836
I'd give anything to shake hands
with a tree again.

01:16:38.926 --> 01:16:41.599
So would I.
And so would the professor.

01:16:41.686 --> 01:16:44.644
I know how badly he wants
to collect specimens,

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:47.320
but he won't ask any favours from Nemo.

01:16:47.406 --> 01:16:50.204
What's wrong with you going instead?

01:16:50.286 --> 01:16:52.083
Nothing. What about you?

01:16:52.166 --> 01:16:55.317
Me? I'm a collectin' fool.

01:16:55.406 --> 01:16:57.237
There's no harm in asking.

01:16:59.086 --> 01:17:01.281
No harm at all, mate.

01:17:07.406 --> 01:17:08.964
Captain, I wondered,

01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:12.516
as long as the professor is not going
ashore, if I could go in his place.

01:17:12.606 --> 01:17:15.439
I'd like to collect specimens
and take some notes.

01:17:15.526 --> 01:17:17.960
- You feel qualified?
- Qualified?

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:20.640
For years, the professor and I
have been working together.

01:17:20.726 --> 01:17:25.322
- And I can row, sir. Got a strong back.
- And a strong desire to escape.

01:17:25.406 --> 01:17:29.194
Who, me? I'm no deserter.
Happy to be aboard, sir.

01:17:29.286 --> 01:17:31.675
- Very well. Permission granted.
- Thank you.

01:17:31.766 --> 01:17:34.678
But stay on the beach.
The natives are cannibals.

01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:38.395
They eat liars with the same enthusiasm
as they eat honest men.

01:17:38.486 --> 01:17:41.478
- Break out the skiff.
- Aye, sir. Break out the skiff.

01:17:49.686 --> 01:17:51.278
Shove off!

01:18:32.206 --> 01:18:34.879
I don't see any native girls
hungry for affection.

01:18:34.966 --> 01:18:36.638
Take it easy.

01:18:37.766 --> 01:18:41.441
Hey, Ned. We're not
supposed to leave the beach.

01:18:41.526 --> 01:18:43.517
Who's leaving it?

01:18:52.486 --> 01:18:54.238
Hey!

01:19:00.406 --> 01:19:02.522
- Come here, quick.
- What is it?

01:19:02.606 --> 01:19:05.279
Look. A trail through the jungle.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.357
You had this in mind all the time.
You want to escape.

01:19:07.446 --> 01:19:08.959
What do ya say? It's a cinch!

01:19:09.046 --> 01:19:11.685
I don't think so or Nemo wouldn't have
let us come ashore.

01:19:11.766 --> 01:19:13.085
Don't forget the cannibals.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:15.555
Belay the cannibals.
He said that to scare us.

01:19:15.646 --> 01:19:18.683
Besides, I couldn't leave the professor.

01:19:18.766 --> 01:19:20.836
I figured that.

01:19:20.926 --> 01:19:24.919
Look at me. I can't get through that jungle.
You'll go faster alone.

01:19:25.006 --> 01:19:27.440
- Hope you make it, Ned.
- I'll make it.

01:19:27.526 --> 01:19:30.484
And I'll have every gunboat
in the navy hunting Nemo.

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:34.195
We'll be laughing about this,
havin' a drink together in Frisco.

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:36.163
Good luck, Ned.

01:19:40.046 --> 01:19:42.241
Give my best to the professor.

01:21:35.366 --> 01:21:37.038
Hey!

01:21:39.606 --> 01:21:42.484
Hey, wait for me!

01:21:46.406 --> 01:21:48.078
Hey!

01:21:54.846 --> 01:21:56.837
Wait for me!

01:21:59.686 --> 01:22:00.914
Hey!

01:22:03.806 --> 01:22:05.125
Hey!

01:22:07.766 --> 01:22:09.245
Hey!

01:23:25.206 --> 01:23:28.243
Hey, cannibals!
Hundreds of cannibals!

01:23:28.326 --> 01:23:29.600
Captain! Captain!

01:23:29.686 --> 01:23:31.995
- Scores of boats!
- We're under attack!

01:23:32.086 --> 01:23:34.475
Naturally. Since you
invaded their privacy,

01:23:34.566 --> 01:23:36.761
they have every right to invade ours.

01:23:47.566 --> 01:23:50.797
They're coming aboard.
Get me a harpoon, quick.

01:23:50.886 --> 01:23:52.114
Close the hatch!

01:23:52.206 --> 01:23:54.322
I'll give the commands
on this boat, Mr Land!

01:23:54.406 --> 01:23:56.124
- Stand aside!
- Aye, sir.

01:24:44.486 --> 01:24:48.445
- I got to see this.
- This is amazing.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:20.518
Hey, Captain, that's one way
to keep guests from droppin' in.

01:25:20.606 --> 01:25:22.597
A mild charge of electricity.

01:25:22.686 --> 01:25:24.961
Not very hospitable, but harmless.

01:25:25.046 --> 01:25:28.641
And speaking of hospitality,
you have abused mine for the last time.

01:25:28.726 --> 01:25:29.636
How's that?

01:25:29.726 --> 01:25:31.796
You've continuously
disobeyed my orders.

01:25:31.886 --> 01:25:34.480
- Who, me?
- I told you once the fate of prisoners.

01:25:34.566 --> 01:25:36.443
But since you insist on
being treated as one,

01:25:36.526 --> 01:25:38.756
I have no choice but to oblige you.

01:25:38.846 --> 01:25:41.599
- Take him in charge.
- What's this all about?

01:25:41.686 --> 01:25:43.916
You left the beach
with the intention of escaping.

01:25:44.006 --> 01:25:46.042
You only came back
because the natives forced you to.

01:25:46.126 --> 01:25:49.880
- You're going to regret that choice.
- Ship rounding the headland, sir.

01:25:49.966 --> 01:25:53.356
When we clear this reef, I'll see
you trouble my existence no longer.

01:25:53.446 --> 01:25:55.914
I should have taken
my chances with the cannibals.

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:00.519
A warship.

01:26:00.606 --> 01:26:02.483
- A warship?
- Put him under guard below.

01:26:02.566 --> 01:26:04.079
Take him below.

01:26:04.166 --> 01:26:06.157
All engines ready.

01:26:06.246 --> 01:26:08.635
- We must break free of the reef.
- Aye, sir.

01:26:08.726 --> 01:26:11.445
Lighten ship and drop all ballast.

01:26:11.526 --> 01:26:13.596
Get below! They'll be
shelling us in a moment.

01:26:13.686 --> 01:26:14.801
Aye, sir.

01:26:16.166 --> 01:26:19.681
- Astern, full!
- Astern full it is, sir.

01:26:32.446 --> 01:26:37.201
Let me out of this...
Let me out of this glory hole!

01:26:39.326 --> 01:26:41.317
Professor! Professor!

01:26:41.406 --> 01:26:44.239
- A warship, professor.
- Warship?

01:27:05.126 --> 01:27:07.082
We're breaking out!

01:27:20.686 --> 01:27:23.519
- Man the watertight doors.
- Aye, sir.

01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:25.085
Man the watertight doors!

01:27:42.006 --> 01:27:43.962
They're shutting the door.

01:27:44.046 --> 01:27:45.877
Wait!

01:27:47.366 --> 01:27:50.961
- Wait!
- Let us out!

01:28:20.406 --> 01:28:22.283
Wait! We are in here!

01:28:22.366 --> 01:28:24.357
Wait!

01:28:28.446 --> 01:28:30.562
Take the wheel.

01:29:03.286 --> 01:29:05.322
How much water
in the power compartment?

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:07.362
Five feet and rising, sir.

01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:12.838
Break out a spare shaft.

01:29:12.926 --> 01:29:15.486
- Break out a spare shaft!
- We must use leverage.

01:29:17.286 --> 01:29:18.799
Bring it athwartships.

01:29:23.646 --> 01:29:28.515
Put the aft end under the leak.
Hands up with the hoist.

01:29:36.006 --> 01:29:37.405
Take up the slack.

01:29:40.446 --> 01:29:42.164
Take a strain.

01:30:00.246 --> 01:30:02.043
Professor.

01:30:02.126 --> 01:30:04.515
Look. The dials aren't moving.

01:30:04.606 --> 01:30:06.164
We've gone too deep.

01:30:25.126 --> 01:30:27.879
- Stand by with braces!
- Aye, sir!

01:30:41.166 --> 01:30:42.758
Braces!

01:30:50.766 --> 01:30:53.200
Braces in place, sir!

01:30:53.286 --> 01:30:56.039
Man your stations! Start engines!

01:31:22.446 --> 01:31:26.405
The air will clear now
that the fans are operating again.

01:31:26.486 --> 01:31:28.681
- Are you all right?
- Thank you. Much better.

01:31:28.766 --> 01:31:31.405
- Have we stopped sinking?
- Fortunately.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:35.081
There are limits beyond which man
and his puny efforts cannot survive.

01:31:35.166 --> 01:31:37.885
We exceeded them by 5,000 feet.

01:31:37.966 --> 01:31:40.560
We're deeper now
than man has ever been before.

01:32:03.646 --> 01:32:05.523
Giant squid astern, sir!

01:32:09.326 --> 01:32:12.045
Emergency speed, all engines!

01:32:21.526 --> 01:32:25.519
- We're fouled. Full repellent charge!
- Aye, sir.

01:32:49.326 --> 01:32:52.716
- Prepare another charge.
- Sorry, sir. All elements burned out.

01:32:52.806 --> 01:32:56.276
We shall fight on the surface.
Assemble all hands in the chart room.

01:32:56.366 --> 01:32:57.321
Aye, sir.

01:32:57.406 --> 01:33:00.398
Drop all ballast.
Diving controls, full up position.

01:33:30.366 --> 01:33:35.156
You'll be fighting at close quarters
with the most tenacious of all sea beasts.

01:33:35.246 --> 01:33:36.725
Stay clear of the tentacles.

01:33:36.806 --> 01:33:39.843
They'll seize anything within reach
and hang on to the death.

01:33:39.926 --> 01:33:42.486
The only vital spot is
directly between the eyes.

01:33:42.566 --> 01:33:45.319
Forty feet and surfacing, sir.

01:33:45.566 --> 01:33:47.284
Stand by.

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:09.997
Stand back!

01:34:21.606 --> 01:34:23.597
Quick! The forward hatch!

01:34:53.006 --> 01:34:57.284
Take your men down the starboard side!
You men, come with me!

01:35:06.846 --> 01:35:11.203
Give me a harpoon!
I'll walk behind it.

01:35:12.486 --> 01:35:14.477
Stay back here!

01:35:22.886 --> 01:35:24.763
Stand clear!

01:36:00.246 --> 01:36:02.362
Throw me another iron!

01:36:28.766 --> 01:36:30.882
Watch it!

01:37:07.406 --> 01:37:09.044
Your hand!

01:37:49.926 --> 01:37:53.839
Well, I'll be...
Are you hurt bad, mate?

01:37:56.486 --> 01:37:59.319
What's up? What happened?

01:39:37.726 --> 01:39:39.159
Mr Land.

01:39:41.286 --> 01:39:43.925
You saved my life.

01:39:44.006 --> 01:39:45.405
Why?

01:39:47.766 --> 01:39:50.234
That's a good question.

01:39:52.046 --> 01:39:54.276
There's only one thing
a fella can do

01:39:54.366 --> 01:39:56.516
when he's made a mistake
as big as this.

01:39:56.606 --> 01:39:57.959
What?

01:39:58.046 --> 01:40:00.116
Get drunk.

01:40:03.726 --> 01:40:06.798
And the girls I've loved on nights
Like this with the moon above

01:40:06.886 --> 01:40:08.558
A whale of a tale, and it's all true

01:40:08.646 --> 01:40:12.241
I swear by my tattoo

01:40:18.686 --> 01:40:23.316
Glad to see you like music, too.
We got a lot in common.

01:40:26.566 --> 01:40:30.195
Thank you, baby.
How about a drink?

01:40:30.286 --> 01:40:32.356
Okay.

01:40:32.446 --> 01:40:36.359
Hey! Would you like
a Flabellina oculina?

01:40:36.446 --> 01:40:38.721
I've tried 'em. Very good.

01:40:47.766 --> 01:40:49.279
Want some?

01:40:52.726 --> 01:40:56.605
Esmeralda, you're the only one
on this barge who understands me.

01:40:56.686 --> 01:40:58.438
Give us a kiss.

01:41:01.566 --> 01:41:04.399
Your whiskers tickle.
Let me see your whiskers.

01:41:04.486 --> 01:41:07.603
You oughta shave, honey.
You're beginning to look like Nemo.

01:41:07.686 --> 01:41:10.325
Let's try it again.
Let's try it again.

01:41:10.406 --> 01:41:14.160
There was old man Nemo

01:41:14.246 --> 01:41:16.441
Fed his crew on worms and fishes

01:41:16.526 --> 01:41:19.643
Eels for breakfast

01:41:19.726 --> 01:41:21.603
Slimy cold on seaweed dishes

01:41:21.686 --> 01:41:23.677
When they ate it

01:41:23.766 --> 01:41:26.075
They knew it wasn't beef

01:41:26.166 --> 01:41:28.396
But eat they did the brisket squid

01:41:28.486 --> 01:41:31.876
A-smellin' like a reef

01:41:38.086 --> 01:41:40.646
Not so loud, Ned. Not so loud.

01:41:40.726 --> 01:41:43.001
She loves those Flabellinas oculinas.

01:41:43.086 --> 01:41:45.520
I am happy you're out of jail, Ned.

01:41:45.606 --> 01:41:48.484
Yeah, I got the run of the ship.
Big-hearted Nemo.

01:41:48.566 --> 01:41:50.397
The professor's very happy, too.

01:41:50.486 --> 01:41:53.523
After all, it's the first time
Nemo has shown any gratitude.

01:41:53.606 --> 01:41:56.120
We don't want none of his gratitude!

01:41:56.206 --> 01:41:58.481
We don't want none
of his gratitude!

01:41:58.566 --> 01:41:59.555
This is awful.

01:41:59.646 --> 01:42:02.240
You can tell him that
for the both of us.

01:42:02.326 --> 01:42:04.442
Do we, Esmeralda?

01:42:04.526 --> 01:42:06.357
Come on.

01:42:06.446 --> 01:42:10.724
I'm gonna take a little nap here.
You lie down there.

01:42:10.806 --> 01:42:13.764
Wrap yourself up good.
I don't want you to catch cold.

01:42:25.086 --> 01:42:27.042
Good night, Esmie.

01:42:42.046 --> 01:42:45.004
My apprentice tells me
you have taken my journal.

01:42:45.086 --> 01:42:46.917
May I ask why?

01:42:47.006 --> 01:42:48.724
I keep no log on the Nautilus,

01:42:48.806 --> 01:42:52.196
and I was frankly curious to read
your account of the giant squid.

01:42:52.286 --> 01:42:55.039
In particular,
my narrow escape and rescue.

01:42:55.126 --> 01:43:00.325
According to you, Mr Land is a hero
in the best tradition of cheap fiction.

01:43:00.406 --> 01:43:03.557
That can only be true
if you consider your life cheap.

01:43:03.646 --> 01:43:06.763
I might have expected you to say that.

01:43:06.846 --> 01:43:11.397
Actually, he regrets saving my life
as much as I would regret saving his.

01:43:11.486 --> 01:43:14.080
The only difference is
that I wouldn't have tried.

01:43:14.166 --> 01:43:19.763
It is that difference that gives Ned Land
a human dignity you no longer possess.

01:43:19.846 --> 01:43:23.998
- May I tell you something?
- You seem determined to. Go ahead.

01:43:24.086 --> 01:43:26.361
You protest too much.

01:43:26.446 --> 01:43:29.165
I know you were deeply
touched by Ned's gesture,

01:43:29.246 --> 01:43:31.316
but you are ashamed to admit it.

01:43:31.406 --> 01:43:33.920
You cannot tolerate a faith in humanity,

01:43:34.006 --> 01:43:38.557
because if you do, all this,
the structure of your very existence,

01:43:38.646 --> 01:43:41.114
which you built on hate and vengeance,

01:43:41.206 --> 01:43:44.357
all this will collapse
around the naked lie of your life.

01:43:44.446 --> 01:43:48.962
You are a beaten man, at war
with the dictates of his heart.

01:43:49.046 --> 01:43:51.719
And you are a very
gullible man, Professor.

01:43:51.806 --> 01:43:52.716
Gullible?

01:43:52.806 --> 01:43:55.400
Yes, you're too easily
swayed by sentiment...

01:43:55.486 --> 01:43:58.922
individual good deeds over bad,
the crude extremes.

01:43:59.006 --> 01:44:01.315
The world is more complex than that,

01:44:01.406 --> 01:44:06.605
and good must not be measured on a scale
as small as Mr Land's brash heroics.

01:44:06.686 --> 01:44:09.962
What he would do one day,
he would gladly undo the next.

01:44:10.046 --> 01:44:13.197
To be of benefit, goodness
must be constant, forever building.

01:44:13.286 --> 01:44:15.436
It must have strength.

01:44:15.526 --> 01:44:17.482
What you seek is perfection.

01:44:17.566 --> 01:44:20.160
- You will never find it.
- I have already found it.

01:44:23.526 --> 01:44:27.201
Here. It is the world
outside that is imperfect.

01:44:27.286 --> 01:44:30.801
If men and nations had this
goodness that I speak of,

01:44:30.886 --> 01:44:33.923
I would be willing
to share all this...

01:44:34.006 --> 01:44:35.997
my records, everything.

01:44:37.806 --> 01:44:39.717
Have you considered sharing it?

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:42.195
That's the only reason
that you're alive today.

01:44:42.286 --> 01:44:44.277
From the moment you came aboard,

01:44:44.366 --> 01:44:47.995
I had hoped that you would be the key
to a plan I had in mind.

01:44:48.086 --> 01:44:50.725
I had intended using you
as an emissary.

01:44:52.366 --> 01:44:54.197
But now I don't know.

01:44:55.926 --> 01:44:59.236
- Is it that you don't trust me?
- No!

01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:01.556
But you are ever the optimist.

01:45:01.646 --> 01:45:05.685
Do you really believe they would lay down
their arms and abolish their slave camps?

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:09.839
Yes, I think I could persuade them.
Let me try.

01:45:13.166 --> 01:45:14.645
We are nearing Vulcania.

01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:18.275
I want you to see
the extent of these secrets

01:45:18.366 --> 01:45:20.084
for which they have hounded me.

01:45:20.166 --> 01:45:23.761
The knowledge which cost the lives
of those dearest to me,

01:45:23.846 --> 01:45:26.644
the power which is still mine.

01:45:26.726 --> 01:45:29.923
Enough energy to lift mankind

01:45:30.006 --> 01:45:33.601
from the depths of hell into heaven...

01:45:33.686 --> 01:45:36.075
or destroy it.

01:45:36.166 --> 01:45:41.001
Perhaps then you will feel less inclined
to barter such a prize.

01:45:41.086 --> 01:45:43.316
We will discuss it at that time.

01:45:48.006 --> 01:45:49.359
We've raised the island.

01:45:49.446 --> 01:45:51.835
- Why have we stopped?
- There are warships ahead.

01:45:53.246 --> 01:45:56.841
- Bearing what flag?
- No flag, sir.

01:45:56.926 --> 01:45:58.803
Very well.

01:46:02.126 --> 01:46:04.003
There's your answer, Professor.

01:46:04.086 --> 01:46:07.317
We've been ambushed by the very forces
you wished to trade with.

01:46:17.166 --> 01:46:19.555
Their boarding parties
have already landed.

01:46:19.646 --> 01:46:22.524
This is a dark hour
for history, Professor.

01:46:24.166 --> 01:46:26.316
They'll be over the summit
in half an hour, sir.

01:46:26.406 --> 01:46:28.397
I estimate 20 minutes.

01:46:29.566 --> 01:46:32.444
Everything must be destroyed
before they reach the lagoon.

01:46:34.126 --> 01:46:37.243
- Ready to dive!
- Aye, sir. Diving stations.

01:46:37.326 --> 01:46:40.398
- Ahead full!
- Diving stations.

01:46:44.886 --> 01:46:46.683
Four degrees down.

01:47:54.846 --> 01:47:58.805
- All engines stop! Break out the skiff.
- Aye, sir.

01:48:04.526 --> 01:48:06.517
What's all the excitement, Captain?

01:48:06.606 --> 01:48:08.722
- What is it, Professor?
- We are at the base.

01:48:08.806 --> 01:48:11.161
The island is surrounded by warships.

01:48:11.246 --> 01:48:13.999
- By warships?
- Warships!

01:48:21.446 --> 01:48:22.925
Shove off.

01:48:23.526 --> 01:48:26.438
- Have everything in readiness aboard.
- Aye, sir.

01:48:28.446 --> 01:48:30.323
Take cover!

01:48:38.966 --> 01:48:41.878
Look! They're coming.

01:48:54.846 --> 01:48:59.124
- I'm gonna let 'em know we're here.
- No, Ned, don't!

01:49:00.126 --> 01:49:02.242
Hey! Hey!

01:49:02.326 --> 01:49:04.920
You up there, we're friends!

01:49:05.006 --> 01:49:08.043
Don't shoot!
We're friends, I tell ya!

01:49:08.126 --> 01:49:10.321
We're the ones that
threw the bottles over!

01:49:12.806 --> 01:49:16.242
Hey, we're friends!
We sent the messages!

01:49:24.246 --> 01:49:27.477
That's gratitude for you,
after all we did for 'em.

01:49:27.566 --> 01:49:30.364
Then it was you
who decoyed those warships here.

01:49:30.446 --> 01:49:33.165
Somebody had to strike
a blow for freedom.

01:49:33.246 --> 01:49:35.362
We did what we thought was right.

01:49:35.446 --> 01:49:37.801
Right? You fools!

01:49:37.886 --> 01:49:41.196
This is going to cost the world
the greatest discoveries of all time.

01:49:41.286 --> 01:49:43.720
He's gone ashore to destroy everything.

01:49:45.926 --> 01:49:49.521
Hey, Professor...
Destroy everything?

01:49:49.606 --> 01:49:52.200
That sounds like he's gonna
plant a bomb or something.

01:50:22.446 --> 01:50:25.677
- Every man to his station.
- Every man to his station.

01:50:59.046 --> 01:51:01.355
Stand by engines. Prepare for diving.

01:51:01.446 --> 01:51:03.801
Aye, sir. Prepare for diving.

01:51:03.886 --> 01:51:05.558
Shall I take over?

01:51:08.766 --> 01:51:10.722
Half ahead.

01:51:10.806 --> 01:51:12.876
Four degrees down.

01:51:36.566 --> 01:51:38.124
Ahead full.

01:52:40.326 --> 01:52:42.282
Slow on engines.

01:52:44.886 --> 01:52:49.038
All controls eight degrees down.

01:53:05.006 --> 01:53:06.644
Lash the wheel.

01:53:07.646 --> 01:53:10.080
Aye, sir. Lash the wheel.

01:53:30.646 --> 01:53:32.125
Captain.

01:54:12.966 --> 01:54:16.276
We are taking the Nautilus
down for the last time.

01:54:26.846 --> 01:54:29.804
We understand, sir, and we're with you.

01:54:29.886 --> 01:54:33.925
Wait a minute. I don't understand.
What's that gotta do with us?

01:54:34.006 --> 01:54:37.521
I'm dying, and
the Nautilus is dying with me.

01:54:37.606 --> 01:54:40.643
- Professor?
- Yes.

01:54:40.726 --> 01:54:42.444
In a matter of minutes,

01:54:42.526 --> 01:54:46.121
an explosion, such as
the world has never known,

01:54:46.206 --> 01:54:50.882
will destroy my island
and all its works forever.

01:54:50.966 --> 01:54:54.197
That is why I have
brought the Nautilus...

01:54:54.286 --> 01:54:55.844
here,

01:54:55.926 --> 01:54:59.396
to its last,
deep resting place.

01:54:59.486 --> 01:55:03.684
Here at least we will die in peace.

01:55:04.646 --> 01:55:07.524
Let every man go
to his quarters and remain there.

01:55:07.606 --> 01:55:09.437
Why do you take us down with you?

01:55:09.526 --> 01:55:11.756
- Lock them in their quarters.
- Aye, sir. Take them out.

01:55:11.846 --> 01:55:14.644
I don't want to die.
Don't let him do it.

01:55:18.326 --> 01:55:20.396
I want no part of this!

01:55:24.566 --> 01:55:27.717
Captain, you cannot do this.

01:55:27.806 --> 01:55:30.320
There is more at stake here
than just our lives.

01:55:30.406 --> 01:55:33.079
Yours was a dream
of the future come true.

01:55:33.166 --> 01:55:34.997
I beg you to reconsider.

01:55:36.606 --> 01:55:40.679
A power greater than mine
makes that impossible.

01:55:42.926 --> 01:55:46.714
But there is hope for the future.

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:49.684
When the world is ready

01:55:49.766 --> 01:55:53.884
for a new and better life,

01:55:53.966 --> 01:55:57.402
all this will someday come to pass...

01:55:59.326 --> 01:56:01.715
in God's good time.

01:56:13.886 --> 01:56:15.114
I'm sorry, Ned.

01:56:15.206 --> 01:56:18.482
Don't give up, mates!
We're no part of any suicide pact!

01:56:20.926 --> 01:56:23.156
Put him in his cabin.

01:58:24.646 --> 01:58:28.559
Come on, I'm taking over the ship.
Let's get outta here.

01:58:38.086 --> 01:58:40.156
We're on the surface. Stand by.

01:58:44.326 --> 01:58:46.794
Let's get the skiff out
and shove off.

01:58:46.886 --> 01:58:49.161
- Professor, where ya goin'?
- My journal.

01:58:49.246 --> 01:58:52.875
- The island's gonna blow up any second.
- I must get my journal.

01:59:15.526 --> 01:59:17.039
Shove off.

01:59:17.126 --> 01:59:19.321
What's the matter? Is he hurt?

01:59:20.406 --> 01:59:22.397
We forgot Esmie.

01:59:22.486 --> 01:59:24.636
Esmeralda, come on. Quick!

01:59:27.686 --> 01:59:29.119
Come on. Come on.

01:59:29.206 --> 01:59:32.437
In the boat, come on. In the boat.

02:00:15.606 --> 02:00:17.437
There she blows!

02:00:49.006 --> 02:00:51.839
Sorry I had to wallop you, Professor.

02:00:51.926 --> 02:00:54.394
Wasn't time to stop for souvenirs.

02:00:56.526 --> 02:00:59.324
Perhaps you did mankind a service, Ned.

02:01:20.926 --> 02:01:24.236
There is hope for the future.

02:01:24.326 --> 02:01:28.444
And when the world is ready
for a new and better life,

02:01:28.526 --> 02:01:32.485
all this will someday come to pass...

02:01:32.566 --> 02:01:35.444
in God's good time.
