20:24.326 --> 20:28.227
and the nose melts down
to a flaming puddle.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.747
Hey, I'll show you right
now over in my yard.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.818
- Randy?

20:33.818 --> 20:34.957
Who are you,

20:34.957 --> 20:36.373
Ben.

20:36.373 --> 20:37.546
What are you doing here?

20:38.547 --> 20:40.066
- Good evening Mrs. Mason.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.171
Randy's being real nice,

20:42.171 --> 20:44.104
helping me with my homework.

20:44.104 --> 20:45.761
- That's my Randy.

20:45.761 --> 20:48.074
Well, I'll leave you
 two boys to it then.

20:52.906 --> 20:56.289
[slow suspenseful music]

21:00.466 --> 21:02.226
- I think he's the cutest guy.

21:02.226 --> 21:05.919
- Let me be the one to fly it.

21:05.919 --> 21:07.542
I'll teach you how.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.991
- Don't worry, man.

21:08.991 --> 21:11.511
I know what I'm doing.

21:11.511 --> 21:13.962
[soft music]

21:19.554 --> 21:20.727
- Now class,

21:20.727 --> 21:22.419
Jamaal has been
 working on his project

21:22.419 --> 21:23.972
for quite some time now.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.732
And today he's going
 to be demonstrating

21:25.732 --> 21:28.425
some of the
 properties of inertia.

21:28.425 --> 21:30.530
So please welcome Jamaal,

21:30.530 --> 21:31.359
excuse me,

21:31.359 --> 21:32.739
the Jamaalster.

21:34.154 --> 21:36.398
[applause]

21:37.848 --> 21:39.539
- Inertia, what is it?

21:39.539 --> 21:40.678
What does it do?

21:40.678 --> 21:43.854
And what's in it for us?

21:43.854 --> 21:45.821
We all know that
 objects in motion

21:45.821 --> 21:47.375
tend to remain in motion.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.861
And objects at rest
tend to remain at rest.

21:50.861 --> 21:52.518
Now comes the latest development

21:52.518 --> 21:54.554
in the science of technology,

21:54.554 --> 21:55.486
the inertia mobile.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.041
Now Newton's first law of motion

21:59.041 --> 22:00.629
tells us that an
object in motion

22:00.629 --> 22:01.630
tends to move in a--

22:02.459 --> 22:04.909
[soft music]

22:09.880 --> 22:12.469
Now the MC of
relativity himself says

22:12.469 --> 22:15.023
that E equals M C squared.

22:15.023 --> 22:17.439
[soft music]

22:40.669 --> 22:42.291
And Newton's third law says

22:42.291 --> 22:43.672
that for every action,

22:43.672 --> 22:47.055
there's an equal and
 opposite reaction.

22:47.055 --> 22:50.403
The inertia mobile's
 carefully constructed system

22:50.403 --> 22:51.680
of springs

22:51.680 --> 22:53.372
allows us to see
 the principles of

22:53.372 --> 22:54.890
Tony and McAnns--

22:54.890 --> 22:56.858
- Mr. Mason, what seems
to be the problem?

22:56.858 --> 23:00.171
- [Jamaal] E equals M C squared.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.138
- [Teacher] Mr. Mason,

23:01.138 --> 23:02.898
please return to your seat.

23:02.898 --> 23:05.349
[soft music]

23:08.835 --> 23:09.733
- What the.

23:11.148 --> 23:14.910
- [Teacher] Mr. Mason,
 I need your attention.

23:15.911 --> 23:18.500
[upbeat music]

23:35.759 --> 23:38.865
[children screaming]

23:45.976 --> 23:48.150
- [Teacher] Please remain.

23:53.086 --> 23:55.157
Everyone stay under your desks.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.227
Jamaal, look out.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.021
Oh no.

23:58.920 --> 24:00.162
Everybody don't panic.

24:00.162 --> 24:01.129
Don't panic.

24:06.341 --> 24:09.344
[explosion booming]

24:26.534 --> 24:28.984
[soft music]

24:55.390 --> 24:57.392
- [Wally White] The
trio of would be robbers

24:57.392 --> 24:58.911
who have alluded authorities

24:58.911 --> 25:01.016
since yesterday's bungled
 convenience store robbery.

25:01.016 --> 25:02.915
The suspects were last seen

25:02.915 --> 25:05.262
driving a stolen white minivan.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.201
- [Mom] Randy, are you there?

25:13.201 --> 25:14.167
The school called.

25:14.167 --> 25:15.755
I understand you crashed a plane

25:15.755 --> 25:17.723
into Jamaal's science project.

25:17.723 --> 25:21.968
Needless to say, I'm
 a little upset here.

25:21.968 --> 25:24.281
When I get home young man,

25:24.281 --> 25:26.904
I'm going to confiscate
 every model in the house.

25:26.904 --> 25:30.459
It's time we established
some new rules.

25:30.459 --> 25:33.601
[phone ringing]

25:33.601 --> 25:35.430
Hi, you've reached the
 home of Brent, Marti,

25:35.430 --> 25:36.914
and Randy Mason.

25:36.914 --> 25:38.157
Leave a message at the tone.

25:38.157 --> 25:40.539
Randy, are you home yet?

25:40.539 --> 25:43.472
Call me at the
 office right away.

25:47.028 --> 25:49.444
[soft music]

26:16.091 --> 26:18.577
- I've never known anyone
 who got expelled before.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.753
Hey, whatcha doing?

26:22.753 --> 26:24.375
- My mom's threatening
 to confiscate

26:24.375 --> 26:26.067
every model in the house.

26:26.067 --> 26:27.309
So I'm taking them
 to the hideout

26:27.309 --> 26:28.587
until things cool down.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.278
- Why don't you
 just tell the truth.

26:30.278 --> 26:32.211
I mean it wasn't your fault.

26:32.211 --> 26:33.350
It was Ben's.

26:33.350 --> 26:34.178
- I know.

26:34.178 --> 26:35.421
But if I tell on him,

26:35.421 --> 26:37.492
he'll just make my
 life more miserable.

26:37.492 --> 26:40.253
And plus, it was
 sort of my fault.

26:42.428 --> 26:44.395
Just help me get
 them there, will ya?

26:44.395 --> 26:46.605
- Okay.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.675
But you know,

26:47.675 --> 26:50.125
you're just making it worse.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.541
[soft music]

26:55.717 --> 26:58.340
[upbeat music]

27:41.694 --> 27:44.214
[dog barking]

27:50.703 --> 27:53.326
[upbeat music]

28:21.941 --> 28:22.977
I helped you get them here.

28:22.977 --> 28:25.704
I gotta go now.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.291
- Don't you want to come up?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.569
- I got a game tonight.

28:29.569 --> 28:30.778
Are you coming?

28:30.778 --> 28:31.710
- Yeah.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.607
I almost forgot.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.302
Judy, you're not
 mad at me are you?

28:38.302 --> 28:39.683
- No.

28:41.029 --> 28:43.031
But I do think you're
 acting like a five year old.

29:07.884 --> 29:09.506
- [Man] Hey, Del,

29:09.506 --> 29:10.472
where you going?

29:10.472 --> 29:11.750
This is a dead end here.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.234
- [Del] Shut up.

29:13.234 --> 29:14.614
- [Lewis] I'm hungry. I thought
we was stopping for donuts.

29:14.614 --> 29:15.995
- No donuts, Lewis.

29:15.995 --> 29:17.548
Cops hang out at donut stands.

29:17.548 --> 29:19.343
- Shut up.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.760
[soft music]

29:54.137 --> 29:57.588
[slow suspenseful music]

30:17.332 --> 30:18.230
Model home,

30:19.162 --> 30:20.266
opening soon.

30:21.129 --> 30:23.407
[laughter]

30:24.581 --> 30:27.929
Like our own personal
 chalet in the Alps.

30:32.969 --> 30:36.386
[slow suspenseful music]

31:00.893 --> 31:02.861
- Wow, this is a
 real pretty house.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.070
[dog barking]

31:05.070 --> 31:06.519
- Hey.

31:06.519 --> 31:07.348
Hey, hey.

31:07.348 --> 31:08.280
Hey, hey, hey.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.143
- Good doggy, good doggy.

31:09.143 --> 31:09.971
[dog barking]

31:09.971 --> 31:10.834
good dog.

31:10.834 --> 31:11.662
Del, help.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.112
[dog barking]

31:13.112 --> 31:16.150
- Give him the candy bar.

31:16.150 --> 31:17.876
- But, it's mine.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.049
- Do it Louis.

31:29.508 --> 31:32.925
[slow suspenseful music]

31:45.075 --> 31:46.352
- That's bad luck,
 the ladder bad luck.

31:46.352 --> 31:49.769
[slow suspenseful music]

31:56.362 --> 31:57.432
[dog barking]

31:57.432 --> 32:01.057
[slow suspenseful music]

32:01.057 --> 32:01.989
- Maybe we can get
 in through here.

32:01.989 --> 32:03.645
Ritchie, break this window pane.

32:03.645 --> 32:05.061
- You know what, Del,

32:05.061 --> 32:07.270
you're really
 starting to bug me.

32:07.270 --> 32:09.824
You are way too bossy.

32:09.824 --> 32:12.620
- [Louis] What about the
burglar alarm, huh Del?

32:12.620 --> 32:15.243
- Just shut up, will you Louis.
I know about burglar alarms.

32:15.243 --> 32:16.624
I just got to check out
where the sensors are.

32:16.624 --> 32:17.901
Now do it Ritchie.

32:17.901 --> 32:18.729
- Do it Louis.

32:19.661 --> 32:20.697
- Oh, okay.

32:20.697 --> 32:21.940
[glass breaking]

32:21.940 --> 32:22.768
- [Del] Get the
 ladder, bean head.

32:26.841 --> 32:27.946
- Well, well, well,

32:27.946 --> 32:29.706
looks like we're
moving up in the world.

32:29.706 --> 32:31.570
- Don't touch anything

32:31.570 --> 32:32.847
until I check out the alarm.

32:32.847 --> 32:34.090
- That looks good.

32:36.885 --> 32:38.163
Hey, it's glued down.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.337
Yo, Del,

32:40.337 --> 32:41.649
everything's fake.

32:42.650 --> 32:45.170
- The whole joint's fake.

32:49.070 --> 32:50.623
- Water works.

32:50.623 --> 32:52.073
- Hey, Ritchie, look out.
 - Yeah, bring it on in.

32:52.073 --> 32:53.592
I got it.

32:53.592 --> 32:54.662
Hey Louis,

32:56.077 --> 32:58.114
why don't you help yourself
 to some cake there pal.

32:58.114 --> 32:58.942
- Oh.

33:00.909 --> 33:03.015
It's fake Ritchie.

33:03.015 --> 33:04.948
- Don't touch anything.

33:04.948 --> 33:06.398
- Oh, I live this

33:06.398 --> 33:07.778
cooking island.

33:07.778 --> 33:09.228
- [Ritchie] Come on,
 big guy, let's go.

33:09.228 --> 33:11.058
- Oh, nice living room.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.852
- Yeah, it's not bad.

33:12.852 --> 33:14.095
- No, no.

33:14.095 --> 33:15.338
- What, what?

33:15.338 --> 33:16.649
- There's alarm pads
 under this carpet.

33:23.139 --> 33:25.003
We'll use the
 ladder for a bridge.

33:27.384 --> 33:28.420
Come through here.

33:29.904 --> 33:32.113
No, no, no, through here.

33:32.113 --> 33:33.459
[interposing voices speaking]

33:33.459 --> 33:35.289
Ritchie, open the garage door

33:35.289 --> 33:36.497
and bring the van in.

33:36.497 --> 33:38.982
- You want me to
 close the door after?

33:38.982 --> 33:41.226
- Yeah, I want you to
 close the door after.

33:41.226 --> 33:43.745
Jesus, do I have to spell
 everything out for you guys?

33:43.745 --> 33:45.333
- You know wouldn't
 do much good anyways

33:45.333 --> 33:47.025
for Ritchie here
 cause he can't spell.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.509
- That's not true.

33:48.509 --> 33:49.682
I can too.

33:49.682 --> 33:51.477
- You cannot.
 - Shut up and do it.

33:51.477 --> 33:52.409
- You know, this
I the first time

33:52.409 --> 33:53.893
I'm ever building a bridge Del.

33:53.893 --> 33:55.757
Although I have
 crossed a couple.

33:55.757 --> 33:56.551
- Shut up.

34:05.836 --> 34:07.804
- Hey Del, why don't
 you shut that off?

34:10.117 --> 34:11.463
- I had a cellmate who
installed these systems.

34:11.463 --> 34:12.981
Once it's on, you
 can't shut it off

34:12.981 --> 34:14.569
without a combination okay.

34:14.569 --> 34:16.018
- [Louis] Okay.

34:16.018 --> 34:16.916
- [Del] Give me the cigarettes.

34:16.916 --> 34:17.745
- Here you go.

34:21.507 --> 34:22.922
What are you doing?

34:22.922 --> 34:24.889
- You can feel the
 sensors under the carpet.

34:24.889 --> 34:29.067
I'm gonna mark the spots
where it's safe to walk.

34:33.208 --> 34:35.176
- Oh this is fun.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.351
Careful Del.

34:38.351 --> 34:39.560
- I know what I'm doing.

34:41.009 --> 34:43.702
It takes at least 30 pounds to
 set one of these babies off.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.704
- Oh, nice bathroom too.

34:47.395 --> 34:50.502
[slow suspenseful music]

34:50.502 --> 34:52.054
- Ritchie do this.

34:52.054 --> 34:53.781
Ritchie do that. Next time
 I'm gonna get my own gang.

34:53.781 --> 34:54.609
No Del.

34:54.609 --> 34:55.472
No Louis.

34:55.472 --> 34:57.025
Just nobody.

34:57.025 --> 35:00.408
[slow suspenseful music]

35:18.633 --> 35:20.048
- This whole carpet

35:20.048 --> 35:21.567
is crisscrossed with sensors.

35:24.398 --> 35:25.709
Just step on the cigarette packs

35:25.709 --> 35:26.676
and we'll be cool.

35:36.962 --> 35:38.136
That's it.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.516
We're okay now.

35:39.516 --> 35:40.517
- You know, it's
not so bad here.

35:40.517 --> 35:41.932
I think I'm just gonna stay.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.797
- Come on down big guy.

35:44.797 --> 35:46.937
Just step on the packs.

35:46.937 --> 35:47.766
Trust me.

35:49.216 --> 35:50.078
- Okay.

35:53.599 --> 35:54.704
Oh this is fun.

35:57.569 --> 35:58.397
Whoa.

36:00.641 --> 36:03.333
This is like a palace.

36:04.403 --> 36:07.820
[slow suspenseful music]

36:33.708 --> 36:35.193
- Oh man, no food.

36:38.092 --> 36:39.956
Oh, a cookbook.

36:39.956 --> 36:41.060
- Hey, Del.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.097
How long we got to hold up here?

36:43.097 --> 36:44.305
- I don't know,

36:44.305 --> 36:45.824

Hey, get the van out here.

Oh.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.061
There's a door to the
 attic I the back hall.

01:06:02.061 --> 01:06:04.408
Bust it open and grab that kid.

01:06:04.408 --> 01:06:05.237

What do we need those
 kids for anyway?

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:09.241
- To get through the
 roadblocks, idiot.

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:11.415
For bargaining chips.

They weren't near

You know, they say
 it's a bargain,

01:06:17.421 --> 01:06:18.319
but it really isn't.

01:06:18.319 --> 01:06:19.147

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:25.791
and get him down from there.

01:08:25.791 --> 01:08:26.792

Do it yourself.

you have bad taste in partners.
