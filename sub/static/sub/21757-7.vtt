a break from your break.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.000
- I think this whole experience

00:08.033 --> 00:09.100
is just making her
a little bitter.

00:09.133 --> 00:10.700

00:10.734 --> 00:12.000
- That looks great.
- Yeah, it's off the chart.

00:12.033 --> 00:13.033

00:13.066 --> 00:14.700
- Absolutely awesome.

- And you want to share that
with someone.

I've realized I should be

to cut you loose.

I'll be sitting on the beach

00:39.367 --> 00:40.734
- I'm gonna completely
let him take control of it

00:40.767 --> 00:42.200
or be a f---ing asshole too.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.467

to be bitter about.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.767

"I'm sorry if I overreacted.

- I'm impressed at EJ's ability
to fend off the charging bull.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.633
That definitely says
a lot about his character.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.433
- Instead of fighting
with the new guy,

08:18.467 --> 08:20.700
appreciate that you have
that extra hand.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.533
- I'll tell you
right now, though.

08:22.567 --> 08:24.633
That attitude onboard,
it's not acceptable

08:24.667 --> 08:26.300
in my eyes,
any captain's eyes.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.567
- Give him a chance.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.633
- He's here.

08:28.667 --> 08:29.633
He's probably gonna stay.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.300
- He is staying.

08:31.333 --> 08:32.567
- So maybe you guys
have a lot in common.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.700
- Oh, my god.

08:33.734 --> 08:35.633
So much, I'm sure.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.033
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

08:42.133 --> 08:43.567
- What do you think
that Brianna and Nico

08:43.600 --> 08:45.433
are doing right now?

08:45.433 --> 08:48.700
- ♪ Bow-chicka-wow-wow ♪

08:48.700 --> 08:50.667
- Uh...yeah.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.500
I just want to kiss this girl
so bad.

08:55.533 --> 08:58.300
- I just hope
he don't get busted.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.533
- Yeah.

08:59.567 --> 09:00.600
- There's some sand on there.

09:00.633 --> 09:02.333
- [laughs]

09:02.367 --> 09:05.333
- Distances are all distorted
at night.

09:05.367 --> 09:07.600
I don't know what the f---
I'm looking at out here.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.500
It's just dangerous as f---.

09:18.066 --> 09:18.367
- I feel like a guest.

09:20.066 --> 09:21.066
- Like a guest?
- Yeah.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.667
- Back to work, hey?

09:33.633 --> 09:37.433
- So I got you something
as a little olive branch.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.000
This is a gift for a friend.

09:39.033 --> 09:40.567
- Aw.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.033
- May have overreacted
last night,

09:42.066 --> 09:43.467
so I apologize.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.433
It's a bracelet.

09:44.467 --> 09:45.500
- Or an anklet.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.700
It's totally me.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.500
- Sorry too.

09:49.533 --> 09:51.433
You know, I didn't have to...
[mumbling]

09:51.467 --> 09:53.033
- Yeah.

09:53.066 --> 09:54.767
- We just have to observe
ourselves a little bit

09:55.000 --> 09:56.633
when we had a couple drinks.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.633
- Yeah.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.367
I feel better.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.433
- EJ, did you have
a moment, man?

10:01.467 --> 10:02.633
- Yeah.

10:02.667 --> 10:05.066
- You know, obviously,
coming in,

10:05.100 --> 10:07.600
there's a lot of stressful
situations going on.

10:07.633 --> 10:09.767
And it's not anything
that's your fault,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.633
and we just need
to work together.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.367
And I shouldn't be
such a dick about it.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.100
So I'm sorry about that,

10:16.100 --> 10:18.734
and I shouldn't ever f---ing
call you an asshole.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.633
I look at it as,
he's not going anywhere,

10:20.667 --> 10:24.667
so we just need to get this
squashed and move on.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.233
- I appreciate it a lot, man.

10:26.266 --> 10:28.066
- We should be
working together,

10:28.100 --> 10:31.533
and this should be like
f---ing cake for us, you know?

10:31.533 --> 10:33.600
- I've dealt
with Nico's type before.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.133
I'll give him another chance,

10:35.133 --> 10:36.533
but I'm not
gonna f---ing forget.

10:36.533 --> 10:37.667
- Thank you, buddy.
- Yeah.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.266
- I really appreciate it.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.667
- I need all the deck crew
on position.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.667
Start getting the anchor up.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.100
Are we pulling chain, Bruno?

10:47.133 --> 10:48.400
- Ready to pull it up?

10:48.433 --> 10:50.533
[whirring, rattling]

10:53.133 --> 10:54.700
- Anchor at water line.

10:56.567 --> 10:57.633
Anchor in the bucket.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.133
- Lock it in, good job.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.467
- He said good job.
- Yeah, he did.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.000
- Those magic words.

11:23.033 --> 11:26.767
- Deck crew, let's get prepped
for night docking.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.633
I don't know what the f---
I'm looking at out here.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.400
Can't see a goddamn thing.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.233
It's just so hard
going in there at night.

11:32.266 --> 11:34.567
Distances are all distorted
at night.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.700
That could be 20 yards,
it could be a half a mile.

11:37.734 --> 11:38.767
- Yeah.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.567
- Well, we're better off

11:40.567 --> 11:43.033
than we were with EJ and Nico
both being here.

11:43.033 --> 11:45.066
It's bad enough going in
during the day

11:45.100 --> 11:46.600
with a proper deck crew.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.266
Now we're gonna do it
at night

11:48.300 --> 11:49.734
with people
that have never, ever

11:49.734 --> 11:51.266
done a night docking before.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.734
It's not a situation

11:52.767 --> 11:55.000
that I'd like to make
a steady diet of.

11:55.033 --> 11:56.734
I'm gonna switch over
to the wing station,

11:56.734 --> 11:58.600
and let's thread
our way through.

11:58.633 --> 11:59.600
- Copy that.

11:59.633 --> 12:01.200
- EJ, over here with me.

12:01.233 --> 12:03.166
- Bruno, can you get
the heaving lines ready?

12:03.200 --> 12:04.266
- Copy.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.533
- Everybody in position,
we're coming in.

12:09.567 --> 12:12.033
People out here going,
"What the hell is he doing?"

12:12.066 --> 12:15.000
- Captain Cowboy.

12:15.033 --> 12:16.600
- How am I looking?

12:16.600 --> 12:18.467
- Sailboat right there,
no masthead light.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.033
- I got it.

12:20.066 --> 12:22.734
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.734
- 35 feet and opening
on port side.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.600
- Bow and stern line
on first.

12:26.633 --> 12:29.567
- Captain, your bow's got
about 15 feet here and closing.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.567
- Stern 18 feet from the dock.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.100
- Go ahead and throw it.

12:33.100 --> 12:37.066
Okay, pull, pull, pull,
pull, pull, pull.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.633
- Looking good.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.233
- Sh--.

12:40.233 --> 12:43.767
- I need all the deck crew
on the aft deck.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.033
- Baker, f---ing rock on.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.200
- Jesus Christ.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.200
F---ing well done, everybody.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.500
Outstanding job.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.767
Well done, I really mean it.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.500
Maybe I should blindfold them

12:54.533 --> 12:56.333
so they can operate
in the dark all the time.

12:56.367 --> 12:58.333
- Ooh, Lord have mercy.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.033
[phone buzzing]

13:17.567 --> 13:20.033
[phone buzzing]

13:29.000 --> 13:31.266
- Show me that squat.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.367
- So how long?

13:32.400 --> 13:34.066
- Burns the legs, right?

13:35.767 --> 13:37.333
- Kate, Matt,

13:37.367 --> 13:40.333
EJ, Nico, down on
the crew mess immediately.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.633
- Copy.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.667
- Hey, buddy.
- Yo.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.633
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.600
- Number five.

13:47.633 --> 13:49.633
Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.567
Leigh Anne incidentally had her
life turned into a book

13:52.600 --> 13:54.400
and then a movie
called "The Blind Side."

13:54.433 --> 13:56.166
- Football movie.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.266
- Is that the one
where they adopt somebody?

13:58.300 --> 14:00.567
- Yes, Sandra Bullock.
- That was like--okay.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.266
- It was a great movie,
it was a great book.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.233
Couples on this trip
are made up of good friends,

14:04.266 --> 14:05.767
family, business partners

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
who just want to unplug
from their busy lives.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.033
I don't see anything
out of the ordinary

14:10.066 --> 14:12.166
as far as food.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.166
These are all Southern people.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.033
- Okay, she's a vegetarian.

14:16.033 --> 14:17.567
That's it, that's easy.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.667
These people
aren't pretentious.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.567
They're not foodies.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.133
They're not gonna go,
"Ugh, I don't think the lemon

14:22.166 --> 14:23.300
has enough zestiness in it."

14:23.333 --> 14:26.033
- An award show themed
dinner party

14:26.066 --> 14:27.100
on the first night.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.567
- Oh, tonight.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.166
- The guests would like
a tailgating-themed

14:30.166 --> 14:32.166
beach picnic as well.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.166
- I'm actually more nervous
to throw a tailgating party

14:34.200 --> 14:36.166
than I would be a white party,

14:36.200 --> 14:38.166
because I don't have
any experience at a tailgate.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.734
Whatever we do, good enough.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.033
- Let's get to work.

14:42.066 --> 14:43.133
- Yeah.

14:47.433 --> 14:49.166
- All deck crew,

14:49.200 --> 14:51.200
we have a meeting
on the aft deck.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
All right, guys, so basically,
I just want to have a meeting

14:53.233 --> 14:56.333
to say that I think
the boat's looking great,

14:56.367 --> 14:59.700
and I'd really like that,
this next charter,

14:59.734 --> 15:02.333
me being the boatswain and all,

15:02.367 --> 15:05.700
Nico, me and you
working together as a team.

15:05.734 --> 15:07.667
Communication on point.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.567
It's gonna be so much better
for the whole team

15:10.600 --> 15:12.066
if we can all just kind of
help each other out

15:12.066 --> 15:13.700
and work together.

15:13.734 --> 15:15.467
I'd really like to see
a little more of that.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.633
Somebody slack in a department,
help somebody out.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.166
The other day,
you needed a little bit help,

15:19.200 --> 15:20.767
and I helped with you.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.333
More so, teamwork is what
I'd really like to see.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.700
- Teamwork makes
the dream work.

15:25.734 --> 15:26.767
- That's right.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.333
- And let's make this one

15:28.367 --> 15:29.700
the f---ing biggest tip
of them all.

15:29.734 --> 15:31.300
- I did cross some boundaries,

15:31.333 --> 15:32.367
and I pushed EJ
a little bit too much.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.700
But the way that he is,

15:33.734 --> 15:35.233
I just can't stand the guy.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.367
- Boosh!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.166
Make this one good!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.433
- Have you seen
the movie "Blind Side"?

15:41.467 --> 15:43.333
- Yes.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.066
- The woman who it's actually
based on is coming.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.367
- Shut the front door.

15:47.367 --> 15:48.367
- Oh, I know.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.300
- She just told me.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.367
- It's so cute that they want
a tailgating party.

15:52.367 --> 15:53.633
- Do we have poms here?

15:53.667 --> 15:54.767
- Cheerleading.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.233
Do you know any cheers?

15:56.266 --> 15:57.266
We need to make
a "Valor" cheer.

15:57.266 --> 15:58.467
- Go, "Valor" team.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
- Oh, you were good.

15:59.533 --> 16:01.066
- Fight for victory.

16:01.100 --> 16:02.066
Whoo!

16:02.100 --> 16:03.000
[laughter]

16:03.033 --> 16:04.767
This is so cool.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.266
- Attention all crew.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.266
We got to switch
into our whites.

16:08.266 --> 16:09.367
- Copy.

16:11.266 --> 16:13.667
- [humming]

16:13.700 --> 16:15.233
- Ready to rock.

16:15.266 --> 16:17.200
- Roly-poly-oly, man.

16:17.233 --> 16:20.734
- All right, kids,
five minutes to show time.

16:20.767 --> 16:22.200
- That's the one
we're gonna take.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.133
- Wow.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.133
- Gonna need everybody
on the main deck aft.

16:26.166 --> 16:31.200
- Here we go, whoo-hoo!
- All right.

16:31.233 --> 16:33.200
- Ah, permission
to come onboard.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.367
- That looks disgusting.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.500
I don't know if this is
bananas Foster

16:38.533 --> 16:41.200
or if a seagull
took a big sh--.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.133
- Permission to come on board.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.300
- You're already here.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.300
- Hi, Leigh Anne Tuohy.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.433
Nice to meet you.

16:50.433 --> 16:51.433
- Hi.
- Hello.

16:51.433 --> 16:53.033
- Good seeing you.

16:53.066 --> 16:54.033
- Matt, how are you?

16:54.066 --> 16:55.300
Nice to meet you.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.500
I'm used to tall people
like you.

16:56.533 --> 16:58.166
- Baker.
- Nice to meet you.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.000
- It's an honor
to have you guys on board.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.433
And I'm gonna have Kate
give you a tour of the boat.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.100
And we'll get
this party started

17:03.133 --> 17:04.166
if it's okay with you guys.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.433
- Perfect.
- Cheers.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.266
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.000
- Ooh, beautiful.

17:09.033 --> 17:10.700
- We'll go first
to the master stateroom,

17:10.734 --> 17:12.033
where you guys
will be sleeping.

17:12.066 --> 17:14.033
- All right.
- Nice!

17:14.066 --> 17:15.367
- Ooh, beautiful.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.500
- It's nice and bright.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.433
- Can I sleep on your couch?

17:18.467 --> 17:20.066
- We've got a lovely room
for you as well.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.066
- Oh, excellent.

17:22.066 --> 17:23.333
- But first we're gonna go
on to the rest of the boat.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.000
- Here we go, Bruno.
- I know.

17:25.033 --> 17:27.000
- Shake and bake.

17:27.033 --> 17:30.033
- So we have two queen rooms,
one with two twin beds.

17:30.066 --> 17:32.400
- Can we sleep on the same bed?
- No.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.066
- That's up to y'all.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.734
- She's already prayed
to Jesus about that.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.734
- The Tuohys remind me a lot
of my family.

17:38.734 --> 17:42.400
Southern roots, authentic,
spiritual, not preachy.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.066
Classy and sassy,
but not snobby.

17:45.066 --> 17:48.467
Jen, if you'll go unpack
the master suitcases?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.400
- Okay.
- Thank you.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.467
- Bri--oh, you're already
starting the cheese plate.

17:52.500 --> 17:53.467
Good girl.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.734
- Oh, yay-yay.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.467
- We're gonna go bow to stern.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.166
- I know the one man
drives the boat,

17:58.200 --> 18:00.166
but what do all the other
little people do?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.033
- They bring drinks.

18:02.066 --> 18:03.367
- No, you have the people
that work outside the boat.

18:03.367 --> 18:04.367
Like, the people in the pants.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.066
- Right.

18:06.100 --> 18:08.033
- Pull, pull, pull, pull,
pull, pull, pull.

18:08.066 --> 18:09.233
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.233
- All lines clear.

18:10.266 --> 18:11.233
- What does she do?

18:11.266 --> 18:12.567
- Kate makes sure

18:12.600 --> 18:14.233
that everything
in the interior is okay.

18:14.233 --> 18:15.233
- She needs to eat
a little more.

18:15.266 --> 18:17.033
[laughter]

18:17.066 --> 18:18.300
- No traffic
on your port side, Cap.

18:18.333 --> 18:19.367
All clear.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.500
- Start pulling for lunch.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.100
You can do placemats,
cutlery.

18:22.100 --> 18:25.033
- Cool.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.367
- 30 feet away.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.100
- Good job, everybody.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.166
- Do you think
we go faster eventually?

18:30.200 --> 18:32.166
[laughter]

18:38.100 --> 18:39.367
- Baker, you ready to go?

18:39.367 --> 18:40.367
- Yes, sir.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.166
- Drop it now.

18:44.233 --> 18:47.100
- Baker has the possibility
to be a great deckhand.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.066
She has the attitude,
the charisma.

18:49.100 --> 18:53.266
So I feel like she's worth
putting the time in.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.533
- Got three shots in the water.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.533
- Lock it in, we're good.

18:56.533 --> 18:58.467
- Hi, Matt.
- Hi.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.633
- Some of our guests would like
to come chat with you.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.233
- Absolutely.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.266
- This is it.
- This is it.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.266
- This is our galley.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.266
- Going up.

19:04.266 --> 19:07.266
- I got it.

19:07.266 --> 19:09.633
- So, for dinner,
what I have planned is,

19:09.667 --> 19:11.467
I have a nice local grouper.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.233
And we'll finish off--
I saw someone

19:13.266 --> 19:15.000
said bananas Foster somewhere.

19:15.033 --> 19:17.233
So I've got some local rum,
then a flambé,

19:17.266 --> 19:19.500
and some local bananas
to make the bananas Foster.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.266
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

19:21.266 --> 19:24.300
- Look at this, on it,
like, just beautiful.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.433
- Yee-haw.
- Good job.

19:26.467 --> 19:31.433
- The guests are moving
to the table.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.567
I bet you 20 bucks
they say Grace.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.233
- You want to say it?
- No, you're good.

19:35.266 --> 19:36.400
- Okay.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.567
- Dear Lord, bless this food.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.433
Bless the people
that prepared it.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.233
- Watch over us, protect us.

19:41.266 --> 19:43.233
- Bless all these
beautiful people

19:43.266 --> 19:44.667
that you've put in our lives.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.533
And bless all those who can't
be with us here now

19:46.567 --> 19:48.166
in body or spirit.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.567
- In Christ's name, Amen.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.033
all: Amen.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.533
- [sighs]

19:53.567 --> 19:55.533
- All right, Matt,
we're ready when you are.

19:55.567 --> 19:56.633
- Thank you.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.000
I'm a little anxious.

19:58.033 --> 19:59.033
I mean, who wouldn't be?

19:59.066 --> 20:00.100
She's the ex.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.166
I mean, I messed up,

20:02.200 --> 20:03.567
and she probably doesn't want
to talk to me ever again.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.300
But the longer
you don't get texts back,

20:05.333 --> 20:07.200
there's a certain
breaking point

20:07.200 --> 20:08.600
where you're just like,
"Okay, I give up."

20:08.633 --> 20:10.200
All right, we're almost there,
two seconds away.

20:10.233 --> 20:12.567
- It's ready?
- Yes, it is.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.333
- Oh, it's salad.
- It's the salad.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.400
- Right here, this is
a blackened chicken salad

20:16.433 --> 20:18.333
with a chipotle dressing.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.533
- Do you know
how many eggplants

20:19.567 --> 20:21.066
they had to kill to make this?

20:21.100 --> 20:23.133
- That's good.
- [laughing]

20:27.600 --> 20:29.266
- How's your day going?
- Good.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.333
- Apologized to him.

20:30.367 --> 20:32.200
He said he was in the wrong.

20:32.233 --> 20:34.600
And I told him I'm sorry
for calling him an asshole,

20:34.633 --> 20:37.133
and that we should
work together.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.600
- Ooh, such a strong man.

20:39.633 --> 20:41.600
- No, well,
I listened to your advice.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.333
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.333
- He'll probably know stuff
that you don't know,

20:45.333 --> 20:46.600
and you'll probably know stuff
that he doesn't know.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.300
- Exactly.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.433
- Tim, we're going
on the sea bobs,

20:49.467 --> 20:50.433
or whatever they are.

20:50.467 --> 20:51.533
[woman yelps]

20:55.233 --> 20:57.367
[woman screams]

20:57.367 --> 21:00.200
- Do we have a time for dinner?
- 8:30.

21:00.233 --> 21:01.700
- Let's see a flip.

21:01.734 --> 21:04.066
[laughter]

21:04.100 --> 21:05.367
- I need to make stars,

21:05.367 --> 21:07.333
and they're all
turning out stupid.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.633
- Let me show you how
a frigging star is done here.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.100
- Yeah, show me.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.233
Show me, EJ.

21:11.266 --> 21:13.233
- Rome wasn't built in a day.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.266
A perfect star takes time.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.100
- Oh, are we not wearing--
- We don't have time to change.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.500
- Aw, sh--.

21:28.533 --> 21:30.333
- Actually, will you change
really quick?

21:30.367 --> 21:32.133
- Change into what
I was wearing before?

21:32.166 --> 21:34.533
- To what we're wearing
right now, same as us.

21:34.567 --> 21:36.600
- So I got to change...

21:36.633 --> 21:38.767
- Just go put it back on,
in five minutes.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.533
Just change the clothes.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.367
- Oh, I wish
I would have known.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.200
- Okay.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.333
- Beautiful table.

21:54.367 --> 21:56.633
- You guys have your own star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.333
- Well, how precious.
- I love it.

21:59.367 --> 22:01.133
- Matt, Matt, Kate.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.266
Matt, Kate.

22:03.300 --> 22:06.233
Did he say where he's going?

22:06.266 --> 22:07.400
Do you know
if the bread is in the oven?

22:07.400 --> 22:08.533
Will you check?

22:08.533 --> 22:10.333
- Come on, you boat people.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.033
- Matt, Kate.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.433
- Yay, Bruno!

22:20.467 --> 22:23.166
- If you want to dress up
in non-uniform things,

22:23.200 --> 22:25.000
then you're gonna be
that dresses up

22:25.033 --> 22:27.467
in non-uniform things.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.433
- Matt, Matt, Kate.

22:39.533 --> 22:42.300
- Come on, you boat people.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.000
- Did you see
where he's going?

22:49.200 --> 22:50.600
- I got a text back,
it's awesome.

22:53.767 --> 22:56.200
I mean, I don't know
where this is gonna go.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.200
But the fact that she picked up
her phone, it's a start.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.567
- Hey, Matt?
- Yeah?

23:00.600 --> 23:02.600
- Can I throw the bread
in the oven?

23:02.633 --> 23:04.200
- I'm coming.

23:04.233 --> 23:05.467
- Well, they're sitting.
- Okay.

23:05.500 --> 23:06.467
- I just threw it in there.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.433
- Good, thank you.

23:08.467 --> 23:09.600
Thank you.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.266
Bread's in the oven?

23:14.300 --> 23:15.734
- Mm-hmm.
- Sweet.

23:15.767 --> 23:17.700
- I put it on the second shelf.
- That's perfect.

23:17.734 --> 23:19.333
- The guests are at the table,
but we're waiting on bread.

23:19.367 --> 23:20.467
- No worries, go for it.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.033
- It shouldn't be my job

23:22.066 --> 23:23.467
to make sure that Chef
is doing his job.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.467
I shouldn't have to tell you,

23:25.467 --> 23:30.333
hey, we're on a yacht,
and the guests would like food.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.600
Is it ready?

23:31.633 --> 23:33.300
- All set.
- Okay, then we'll go.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.567
- Thank you.
- Ladies got pasta.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.033
- Okay, Kate, what do we got?

23:40.066 --> 23:41.500
- Local grouper,
asparagus, and quinoa.

23:41.533 --> 23:43.433
- Oh, I love quinoa.
- Quinoa.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.734
- All right, onion and tomato,
Fosters.

23:45.767 --> 23:48.500
- This is phenomenal.
- My fish is delicious.

23:48.533 --> 23:50.467
- Push in the banana,
and the peel will break open.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.433
- Best actress:
Sandy for "The Blind Side."

23:53.467 --> 23:54.633
- Did she win an actress
for that?

23:54.633 --> 23:56.333
- She did.

23:56.367 --> 23:57.767
- Hey, where the hell
have you been?

23:58.000 --> 24:00.500
- I thought you deserved
the Oscar, not Sandra.

24:00.533 --> 24:01.734
- That's sweet.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.633
- These bananas
are really good.

24:03.667 --> 24:06.300
Did you remember a tub
of vanilla ice cream?

24:06.333 --> 24:08.367
- No.

24:08.367 --> 24:10.233
- [sighs]

24:10.266 --> 24:12.200
F---.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.633
- [clears throat]

24:17.533 --> 24:19.500
- Perfect, I like
bananas and chocolate.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.533
People dip bananas in chocolate
and then freeze them.

24:21.533 --> 24:24.266
All right, total.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.000
- Banana Foster with chocolate?

24:26.033 --> 24:27.533
- Yes, exactly.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.266
Thank you very much.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.400
- That is a bowl of goodness.

24:31.433 --> 24:32.734
- Wait, is that chocolate?

24:32.767 --> 24:34.066
- It's chocolate ice cream.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.100
- Can I get vanilla?

24:35.133 --> 24:36.633
- Yes.
- Me too.

24:36.667 --> 24:38.500
- We need two
with vanilla ice cream.

24:38.533 --> 24:40.266
- I don't have it.

24:40.300 --> 24:41.667
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.367
- How can you not
have vanilla ice cream?

24:43.400 --> 24:44.734
- I have mint chocolate chip.

24:44.767 --> 24:47.367
- I hate chocolate ice cream.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.066
- Why don't we make
whipped cream in a Kitchen-Aid

24:49.100 --> 24:50.467
and do some fresh
bananas Foster?

24:50.500 --> 24:52.000
- We're done
with the bananas.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.400
- Okay, can you
re-caramelize it,

24:53.433 --> 24:55.367
make it feel fresh?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.033
If Matt was an asshole,
I would flip out at him.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.700
But Matt is like
this little Canadian puppy,

25:00.734 --> 25:04.400
and you're just not gonna yell
at the cute little puppy.

25:04.433 --> 25:06.367
- I got to have ice cream.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.367
These boat people
should have it now.

25:08.400 --> 25:12.033
- That's nice and hot.

25:12.033 --> 25:13.300
- Good?
- Yeah.

25:13.333 --> 25:14.567
- You want to take these out

25:14.600 --> 25:17.033
and say it's fresh
vanilla cream.

25:17.066 --> 25:20.000
Just leave out the "ice."

25:20.033 --> 25:21.433
- There you go.

25:21.467 --> 25:23.633
- Thank you so much.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.700
It's just vanilla ice cream.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.367
- Oh, I like vanilla.

25:31.066 --> 25:32.633
- It's just whipped cream?

25:35.333 --> 25:36.567
- 6:30, thank you very much.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.433
- 6:30?
- Don't hate me.

25:38.467 --> 25:41.133
- So we had the largest tub,
and it disappeared.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.166
- After you're done,
we'll just kind of make sure

25:46.200 --> 25:48.433
the crew mess is all
cleaned up and stuff,

25:48.467 --> 25:50.133
and then hang out
with our wangs out.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.066
- All right, adios.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.600
- All right,
great times, y'all.

25:53.633 --> 25:56.000
- Peace out, love you.

25:56.033 --> 25:58.066
- I'm sorry, but that...

25:58.066 --> 26:00.467
- Mush.
- No, it's disgusting.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.734
- I just don't know
if this is bananas Foster

26:02.734 --> 26:05.467
or if a seagull
took a big sh--.

26:05.467 --> 26:06.734
- Good night, ladies.

26:06.767 --> 26:08.533
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, good.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.734
- No, EJ is totally--

26:09.767 --> 26:11.467
- I know, I don't know why

26:11.467 --> 26:12.667
he just can't remember
the cushions.

26:12.700 --> 26:14.467
- [mouthing silently]

26:14.500 --> 26:16.533
- I had to be like,
Bruno is in the lights.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.767
- Just wanted to call
and say hi

26:29.000 --> 26:32.100
and tell you that I'm
just thinking about you.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.066
Hearing her voice for
the first time in a long time

26:35.100 --> 26:36.500
is just perfect.

26:36.533 --> 26:37.767
[laughing]

26:38.000 --> 26:39.100
Thanks.

26:39.133 --> 26:40.633
This is just me being selfish

26:40.633 --> 26:42.633
and calling it your voice,
actually.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.433
This makes me miss her
even more.

26:44.467 --> 26:46.433
All right, sweet dreams.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.500
- Good morning.

26:57.533 --> 27:01.033
- Want some croissant?
- Only if it's chocolate.

27:01.066 --> 27:02.500
- Would I give it to you
if it wasn't?

27:02.533 --> 27:04.233
- Aw.

27:04.266 --> 27:06.667
- Every morning is always
like an epic sunrise.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.367
- It's kind of quiet;
no one's awake.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.133
- I normally sit up port
in front of the bridge

27:10.166 --> 27:11.400
and have a coffee.

27:11.433 --> 27:13.233
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

27:13.266 --> 27:15.133
- Bruno, can you come
clean up the lavs?

27:15.166 --> 27:18.033
Nico and Baker,
get ready to lift the anchor.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.033
Let's do it, girl.

27:24.533 --> 27:25.767
- Everything's good.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.133
- Lock it in,
well done, Baker.

27:27.166 --> 27:30.000
- Secure that f---er.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.467
- Good morning.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.533
You can help yourself.

27:34.567 --> 27:36.734
- Okay.

27:36.767 --> 27:40.066
Honey, just like I do
every morning for you at home.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.500
- I'm so used to this.

27:42.533 --> 27:44.533
- I don't think we're gonna get
anything nicer than this.

27:44.567 --> 27:47.066
Bruno,
give me three shots now.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.533
- Pick up the slack
so it doesn't get stuck

27:51.567 --> 27:55.633
up in the props.

27:55.667 --> 27:58.533
- Three shots in the water.
- Lock it in.

27:58.567 --> 28:00.700
- So now we've dropped anchor.

28:00.734 --> 28:02.033
You're gonna take them
to the beach?

28:02.066 --> 28:03.633
- Let's try and shoot for noon.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.233
- Mostly, yachting
is champagne wishes

28:05.266 --> 28:06.700
and caviar dreams,

28:06.734 --> 28:08.266
but this boat,
we're more like,

28:08.300 --> 28:10.166
try to survive mediocrity.

28:10.166 --> 28:13.100
Jen, you're gonna be primarily
in charge of entertainment.

28:13.133 --> 28:14.700
We have megaphones,
we have pom-poms.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.033
And keep their drinks filled.

28:17.066 --> 28:18.500
You are gonna be in charge

28:18.533 --> 28:20.567
of assisting Matt
in the food service.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.033
Burgers,
we've got ketchup, mustard.

28:23.066 --> 28:24.500
What kind of wings
are you making?

28:24.533 --> 28:26.066
- Barbecue and hot.

28:26.066 --> 28:27.533
- Do we have blue cheese?

28:27.567 --> 28:29.066
- I do have
blue cheese dressing.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.300
- Okay, we need to put that in
for sure.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.734
- Okay, I will put that
in there.

28:31.767 --> 28:34.100
- Tailgate glam, people,
tailgate glam.

28:41.233 --> 28:43.133
- Have a good time, guys.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.100
- We're all set up
privately to the right.

28:53.500 --> 28:55.567
- Kate seems to be
super stressed,

28:55.600 --> 28:59.734
so I'm gonna try and knock
this cheer out of the park.

28:59.734 --> 29:01.567
- Whoa, pretty good spiral.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.734
- Matt, what you got,
what you got?

29:02.767 --> 29:04.266
- We have some barbecue wings.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.600
We've got
some beautiful burgers.

29:05.633 --> 29:06.600
This is a win-win.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.300
We're at the beach.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.633
They want simple food,
which is great.

29:09.633 --> 29:10.633
Just give them what they want.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.100
- It's delicious.

29:12.133 --> 29:13.333
- As we shovel it
in our mouth.

29:13.367 --> 29:14.500
- Going back for more wings.

29:14.533 --> 29:15.500
Love 'em.

29:15.533 --> 29:16.700
- Yay!

29:16.734 --> 29:19.567
Bruno!

29:19.600 --> 29:21.100
- Jen, what the f---?

29:21.133 --> 29:22.734
Like, where's your uniform?

29:22.767 --> 29:25.567
- Look at how cute
you look, Jen.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.100
- You're on your own.

29:30.133 --> 29:32.033
This is the fifth charter.

29:32.066 --> 29:33.100
If you don't have it by now,
there's no hope for you.

29:33.133 --> 29:34.200
- Figure it out.
- [sighs]

29:37.700 --> 29:38.233
- How is everything?

29:38.233 --> 29:38.467
- How is everything?
- It's delicious.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.300
- Yay!

29:41.333 --> 29:43.200
Bruno!

29:43.233 --> 29:44.767
Whoo!

29:44.767 --> 29:46.500
- Appropriate for
the tailgating party.

29:46.533 --> 29:48.233
- Just need
the right energy.

29:48.266 --> 29:50.266
Got to pump, pump,
pump it up.

29:50.300 --> 29:54.133
- Look at how cute
you look, Jen.

29:54.133 --> 29:55.333
- For tailgating.

29:55.367 --> 29:57.533
Hopefully Kate
will be so happy

29:57.567 --> 29:59.767
and she'll finally
be proud of me.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.300
Don't make me blow the whistle.

30:04.033 --> 30:05.100
Do you need me?

30:05.133 --> 30:07.200
- No, no, I'm good.

30:07.233 --> 30:08.667
- Oh, gosh.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.266
- Like, she changed clothes.
- I know.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.066
- Normally, you would never

30:12.100 --> 30:14.066
be out of uniform
in front of charter guests.

30:14.100 --> 30:16.266
And Kate couldn't have
approved this.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.000
- They are loving it.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.633
- Okay, let me know
if they need

30:19.667 --> 30:21.333
any other drinks
besides what they have.

30:21.367 --> 30:23.133
- Copy.

30:23.166 --> 30:24.667
- Y'all are wanting to do
like a cheer thing?

30:24.700 --> 30:28.133
- Maybe just bust out
some freestyle stomp.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.600
- V-A-L...

30:29.633 --> 30:31.400
- And then we could do
like a--yes.

30:31.433 --> 30:33.700
- I've been stepping
since back in the day.

30:33.734 --> 30:35.567
I was the only white girl
on the step team.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.400
So my skills come
from a young age.

30:38.433 --> 30:40.367
All right, are you guys ready
for the yachty totty?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.700
- Whoo!

30:41.734 --> 30:43.233
The yachty totty!

30:43.266 --> 30:45.567
- Yeah, we're gonna do it
right over here.

30:45.600 --> 30:47.166
Give me a "V"!

30:47.166 --> 30:48.567
all: "V"!

30:48.600 --> 30:50.033
- You got your "V,"
you got your "V."

30:50.066 --> 30:51.700
Give me an "A,"
give me an "L,"

30:51.734 --> 30:53.367
give me an "O,"
give me an "R"!

30:53.400 --> 30:55.000
all: "R"!

30:55.033 --> 30:56.400
- You got your "R,"
you got your "R."

30:56.433 --> 30:57.700
Wee!

30:57.700 --> 31:00.767
[cheering]

31:04.300 --> 31:05.767
- That was really good.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.266
- So how was the beach party?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.700
- Oh, my gosh,
it was beautiful.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.300
The setup--
like, you saw the setup.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.700
- Yeah, I organized it.
- They loved that.

31:12.734 --> 31:15.400
- I just need to chat with you
about tonight's dinner menu.

31:15.433 --> 31:18.333
- Yes.

31:18.367 --> 31:21.600
Well, they like any vegetable,
which is a good sign,

31:21.633 --> 31:23.066
so I have that.

31:23.100 --> 31:26.033
That's not an issue,
covered.

31:26.066 --> 31:28.066
As a starter,
the appetizer...

31:28.066 --> 31:29.600
Breakfast, lunch, snacks...

31:29.633 --> 31:31.734
With veal demi glaze,
they love that idea.

31:31.767 --> 31:33.300
Carrots, we got that;
broccoli, we have it.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.033
- Okay, I'm only gonna
say this to you

31:35.066 --> 31:37.667
because I like you
and I enjoy working with you.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.066
What happened last night?

31:39.066 --> 31:40.066
Are you tired?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.066
Do you need help?

31:41.100 --> 31:42.166
How can I help you?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.600
Are you happy here?

31:43.633 --> 31:45.133
- Yeah.
- You're happy to stay?

31:45.166 --> 31:46.266
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, good.

31:46.300 --> 31:47.734
- Perhaps I'm enabling Matt,

31:47.734 --> 31:48.667
because he seems
to be slipping downward,

31:48.700 --> 31:50.333
the less I say.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.433
Last night's bananas Foster
were not okay.

31:52.467 --> 31:56.200
I would love to see, tonight,
your most out-of-the-box.

31:56.233 --> 31:58.100
Let's do dots,
let's do smears.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.700
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's do towers.

31:59.734 --> 32:01.100
- As uncomfortable
as it is to hear,

32:01.133 --> 32:02.233
Kate's absolutely correct.

32:02.266 --> 32:03.734
I've been distracted,

32:03.767 --> 32:05.233
and I should have really
paid attention

32:05.266 --> 32:07.100
to my ice cream volume.

32:07.133 --> 32:08.233
So let's make up
for yesterday's meal

32:08.266 --> 32:09.633
I'm pulling up all the stops.

32:09.667 --> 32:10.700
- Get creative,
go out of the box.

32:10.734 --> 32:12.333
I want to see what you got.

32:14.000 --> 32:14.767
- Yes.

32:14.767 --> 32:16.367
- Let's herd these cats.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.100
- All crew,
guests are coming back.

32:18.133 --> 32:19.100
- Right here.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.233
- Best tailgate ever.

32:21.266 --> 32:24.333
[cheering]

32:24.367 --> 32:25.767
- Let's go, team!

32:26.000 --> 32:28.033
Whoo!

32:28.066 --> 32:30.367
- Hello, how was it?

32:30.367 --> 32:32.433
- It was awesome.
- Good.

32:32.467 --> 32:34.367
- It's a sign of insanity,

32:34.400 --> 32:37.200
that she thinks this is okay.

32:37.233 --> 32:39.266
I don't even know
what's going on anymore.

32:39.300 --> 32:41.000
Am I dreaming?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.367
Can I get you anything,
Leigh Anne?

32:42.400 --> 32:44.233
- That's all right,
I'm good right now.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.166
I'm gonna wait till dinner,
thank you so much.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.400
- Oh, my gosh, this is
a hideous little outfit.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.200
- Jean, you better hold on
to the girls.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.333
Nice, Lawrence!

32:59.367 --> 33:02.667
10, that was a 10, 10, 10!

33:02.700 --> 33:05.367
- What time is dinner?
- 8:00-ish.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.400
- Okay, Bruno is
gonna be in here.

33:07.433 --> 33:09.266
He's just gonna shower,
take a little break,

33:09.300 --> 33:10.400
and then he'll be here
at like 7:00.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.000
- Everyone's pretty chill.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.266
7:00 is great, thank you.

33:13.300 --> 33:14.734
- Tell me about the beach.

33:14.767 --> 33:16.367
- It went really well.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.266
- When exactly
did Jen change her uniform?

33:18.300 --> 33:20.000
Because she didn't
leave the boat in that.

33:20.033 --> 33:21.266
- As soon as we got there.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.367
Did you know
she was wearing that?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.400
- No, here's the thing.

33:24.433 --> 33:27.700
I don't mind creative license.

33:27.700 --> 33:30.166
I don't like sneaking.

33:30.166 --> 33:32.166
- I think she was just trying
to take on a character.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.767
- I would believe that if
she looked like a cheerleader.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
I appreciate you playing
devil's advocate.

33:38.033 --> 33:39.233
- Yeah.

33:44.734 --> 33:46.033
- Hey.
- Hey, Cap.

33:46.033 --> 33:47.033
- How'd today go?

33:47.066 --> 33:48.033
- It went smooth.

33:48.066 --> 33:49.166
- So no issues?

33:49.200 --> 33:50.367
- Oh, yeah, they had a blast.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.500
Nico is not somebody I trust

33:52.533 --> 33:54.233
or I think
I can ever trust,

33:54.266 --> 33:55.367
but in the end of the day,

33:55.400 --> 33:57.166
I'm gonna take it upon myself

33:57.166 --> 33:58.700
to deal with the situation
like a man.

33:58.734 --> 34:00.333
I'm no snitch.

34:00.367 --> 34:02.133
- Good job, I really mean it.
- Thank you.

34:02.166 --> 34:03.333
- Thanks.
- Catch you in a bit.

34:03.367 --> 34:04.400
- Yep.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.033
- You know, I'm bummed out

34:08.066 --> 34:12.000
that Jen decided
to just kind of sneak off

34:12.033 --> 34:15.033
and wear her own
bizarre, weird outfit.

34:15.066 --> 34:17.400
And then it hit me,
Jen can dress up,

34:17.433 --> 34:19.266
because she loves it, clearly,

34:19.300 --> 34:21.166
in a surprise outfit
for the guests.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.000
- To serve dinner
in the outfit?

34:23.033 --> 34:25.166
- I want to teach her
a lesson

34:25.200 --> 34:27.400
that, like,
if you want to dress up

34:27.433 --> 34:29.700
in non-uniform things,

34:29.734 --> 34:33.200
then you're gonna be the person
that dresses up

34:33.233 --> 34:35.133
in non-uniform things.

34:35.166 --> 34:36.567
- I'm glad Kate
is just my roommate,

34:36.600 --> 34:38.200
because I don't want
to do anything

34:38.233 --> 34:39.533
to get on her bad side.

34:39.567 --> 34:42.066
- She will be
the "Valor" mascot.

34:48.233 --> 34:49.467
- Matt.
- Bruno.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.066
- I want you to help
make dessert.

34:51.100 --> 34:52.166
We're gonna make
cheesecake two ways.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.233
- Two ways like...

34:53.233 --> 34:54.500
- We'll make little balls,

34:54.533 --> 34:56.367
and we'll dip it
in white chocolate,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.233
and then we'll dip the
other one in dark chocolate.

34:58.233 --> 34:59.367
And then we'll put them
back in the fridge,

34:59.367 --> 35:01.100
and it'll be like truffles.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.367
You know, that's what I like
about Bruno.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.066
He's always willing
to help out,

35:04.100 --> 35:05.467
even if it's
not his department.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.300
- I need nine pieces.
- Consider it done.

35:07.333 --> 35:08.500
- He's creative.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.166
Stay a little longer.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.333
Here, take something
off my list.

35:11.367 --> 35:12.767
That's fantastic.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.066
- No worries,
I got these balls.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.767
- I like having
a little sous chef.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.767
- Hey, Captain Lee.
- Yes?

35:19.000 --> 35:20.300
- Cheap stew.

35:20.333 --> 35:23.000
- Um...
so, the surprise tonight.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.066
Would you like to have
dinner with the guests?

35:25.100 --> 35:27.133
- I'm in.
- All right.

35:27.166 --> 35:28.467
- Get ready, sports fans.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.333
Captain Lee
is coming to dinner.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.066
- Oh-ho.

35:37.567 --> 35:40.500
- Are we late?

35:40.533 --> 35:42.133
Help me.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.500
- Ah, look at this.

35:43.533 --> 35:46.000
- That's so gorge.
- Wow, look at this.

35:46.033 --> 35:47.467
- Beautiful.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.233
- You have a surprise guest.

35:49.266 --> 35:50.500
- No, we do not.

35:50.533 --> 35:52.266
- And it's going
to be Captain Lee.

35:52.266 --> 35:55.100
[cheering]

35:55.133 --> 35:57.266
- How great is--
you're a mind reader.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.500
- Here he is.

35:58.533 --> 36:01.400
[cheering]

36:01.433 --> 36:04.233
- An honor.

36:04.266 --> 36:06.300
- Heard you had
an empty seat at the table,

36:06.333 --> 36:08.400
so I thought I'd just
barge right in.

36:08.433 --> 36:10.567
- Great to have you with us.
- Thank you.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.266
- Look at this guy go.

36:12.300 --> 36:16.367
Holy sh--,
Chef Gaston over here.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.100
- They're happy
talking to the Captain.

36:18.133 --> 36:19.300
- Okay, great.

36:19.300 --> 36:20.433
- Jen, Jen, Kate.

36:20.467 --> 36:21.433
- Go ahead.

36:21.467 --> 36:22.533
- Are you in the master?

36:22.567 --> 36:24.233
- Yes, ma'am.

36:24.266 --> 36:25.400
- All right,
I'm coming to see you.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.367
- How's it going?
- Good.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.400
- So I have a very exciting...

36:30.433 --> 36:31.500
- Surprise reveal?

36:31.533 --> 36:32.500
- Yes.

36:32.533 --> 36:33.567
- Is it about me?

36:33.600 --> 36:35.100
- Kind of.
- Oh, god.

36:35.133 --> 36:36.400
- I'm really nervous right now.

36:36.433 --> 36:38.567
- You're gonna be
the "Valor" mascot.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.300
[faint whistling]

36:41.300 --> 36:42.367
You have to do it.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
- Okay, what is it?

36:43.433 --> 36:45.300
What is the mascot?

36:45.300 --> 36:47.200
- You're gonna wear
light-up sneakers from Baker.

36:47.233 --> 36:48.667
You're gonna wear one
of Baker's really cool visors

36:48.700 --> 36:50.133
that I really want.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.133
- God, I can't.

36:51.166 --> 36:52.300
- You have to do it.

36:52.333 --> 36:53.600
- Is this gonna be
humiliating?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.600
- I never said,
"Oh, hey, Jen,

36:55.600 --> 36:58.300
"just wear this random
tropical flowered halter top

36:58.333 --> 37:00.200
"that doesn't even look
like a boat uniform--

37:00.200 --> 37:01.600
or a cheerleader uniform,
quite frankly."

37:01.600 --> 37:03.333
- I just wanted her
to be happy.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.467
But instead, here we go again.

37:05.467 --> 37:07.333
- She looks like
a little old lady.

37:07.367 --> 37:09.133
[laughter]

37:09.166 --> 37:10.467
- I just--I can't win.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.333
- Okay, quickly,
quickly, do the cabin.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.433
- [sighs]

37:18.767 --> 37:19.300
- It's so cool, Matt.

37:21.333 --> 37:22.400
- I'm gonna make the egg
as a fennel salad

37:22.433 --> 37:24.166
with Maine lobster,

37:24.200 --> 37:25.700
marinated with lemon juice
and olive oil.

37:25.734 --> 37:28.066
- My favorite thing
you've made so far.

37:28.100 --> 37:29.300
Pardon me,
this is a beautiful

37:29.333 --> 37:30.467
lobster Cobb salad to start.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.233
- Just awesome.
- Enjoy.

37:32.266 --> 37:33.500
- So yummy.
- That's cute.

37:33.533 --> 37:36.367
- Love lobster.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.433
- Good night, guys.

37:37.467 --> 37:38.633
See you tomorrow, huh?

37:38.667 --> 37:39.700
- Yes, sir,
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:39.734 --> 37:41.300
- I have to ask you,

37:41.333 --> 37:42.700
how did the whole thing

37:42.734 --> 37:44.367
about the book and all that
come about?

37:44.400 --> 37:45.633
- The writer of the book,

37:45.667 --> 37:47.100
he and I went
to school together

37:47.133 --> 37:50.166
since we were 5 years old.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.166
- I can start taking them out
when you're ready.

37:52.200 --> 37:53.633
- After the
bananas Foster mishap,

37:53.633 --> 37:55.367
these guys are in for a treat.

37:55.367 --> 37:56.467
Steak is my favorite thing
to make.

37:56.500 --> 37:58.166
I make it like a boss.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.166
Like, honestly,
no one can beat my meat.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.100
[laughs]

38:02.133 --> 38:04.467
- Thank you very much.

38:04.500 --> 38:05.734
- Thank you.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.600
- Three seasons.
- Great, thanks.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.467
- Ooh!

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
- Pardon me, this is
a beautiful beef tenderloin

38:11.533 --> 38:13.200
with cauliflower puree

38:13.233 --> 38:16.200
and butternut squash
in a veal demi glaze.

38:16.233 --> 38:18.633
Enjoy.

38:18.667 --> 38:20.600
- And so I get a call
from Steven Spielberg,

38:20.633 --> 38:22.400
Harvey Weinstein.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.400
I had to give them the rights
to use our name.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.200
And I said, "I'll give you
the rights to use the name

38:26.233 --> 38:27.667
"if I get to read
the script and approve it,

38:27.667 --> 38:29.667
or unapprove it."

38:29.667 --> 38:31.367
- They seem very happy, Matt.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.100
They're in conversation
and chewing.

38:33.133 --> 38:35.133
But they look beautiful.

38:35.166 --> 38:36.266
It looks very beautiful.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.133
- Took your advice, Kate.

38:38.166 --> 38:41.667
- I just want everybody
to have a great season.

38:41.700 --> 38:44.467
- And so, sure enough,
seven months later,

38:44.500 --> 38:46.133
we get an envelope in the mail,

38:46.166 --> 38:48.600
and it's a script
of the movie.

38:48.633 --> 38:50.333
- I love that,
love that color.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.433
- Look at those.

38:59.467 --> 39:00.533
- Aren't they awesome?

39:00.567 --> 39:02.166
- Yes, they are amazing.

39:02.200 --> 39:03.633
So beautiful.

39:06.433 --> 39:08.300
- Bruno did so amazing.

39:08.333 --> 39:11.300
It's pretty impressive,
very proud of him.

39:11.333 --> 39:12.433
- No calories, right?

39:12.467 --> 39:16.433
- 136 pages, yeah.

39:16.467 --> 39:17.567
- Jen, Jen, Kate.

39:17.567 --> 39:18.667
- I'm right here, Kate.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.300
- Okay, it is go time.

39:20.300 --> 39:21.633
Come on, grab your outfit.

39:21.667 --> 39:25.166
- Where is my outfit?
- Come on.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.367
- Kate.
- What?

39:26.400 --> 39:28.266
- I'm gonna trip
in these shoes.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.500
I feel like
one of those little dogs

39:30.533 --> 39:31.767
that, you know, the women,

39:32.000 --> 39:33.533
their kids
are all out of the nest,

39:33.567 --> 39:35.600
and their husbands
died or left them,

39:35.633 --> 39:37.333
and they dress their dogs up

39:37.333 --> 39:38.734
in these really
ridiculous outfits,

39:38.767 --> 39:41.000
and the dogs can't
speak up for themselves.

39:41.033 --> 39:42.467
That's what I feel like
right now.

39:42.467 --> 39:43.734
Hold on, hold on.

39:43.767 --> 39:45.734
I can't get the life vest
over my head.

39:45.767 --> 39:47.333
It sucks.

39:47.367 --> 39:49.266
- If this is
an emergency situation,

39:49.300 --> 39:50.467
you would be in trouble.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.300
I'm glad we're going over this.

39:52.333 --> 39:53.433
- I open my front door,

39:53.467 --> 39:54.467
and Sandy's standing there,

39:54.500 --> 39:57.200
and I was like, "Huh."

39:57.233 --> 39:58.333
- Pardon me.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.433
We have a little surprise.

39:59.467 --> 40:01.300
You guys love sports.

40:01.333 --> 40:05.200
So we thought we'd show you
our "Valor" team mascot.

40:05.233 --> 40:06.467
- I'm not liking this.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.567
It doesn't make any sense.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.266
It's not fair.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.266
F---.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.333
- Whoo!

40:11.367 --> 40:13.734
Go, go!

40:13.734 --> 40:17.333
[cheering]

40:17.367 --> 40:20.367
[whistles blowing]

40:30.400 --> 40:32.367
- Oh, my god.

40:32.367 --> 40:33.633
- Nicely done, Jen.

40:33.667 --> 40:35.367
That was awesome.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.433
- Did you see how happy
Captain Lee was?

40:37.467 --> 40:39.233
- You killed it.
- They loved it.

40:39.266 --> 40:40.500
- Best moment of my life,
right now,

40:40.533 --> 40:42.500
undressing out of this.

40:42.533 --> 40:44.333
- Good night.

40:44.367 --> 40:45.767
- Leigh Anne,
it has been such a pleasure.

40:45.767 --> 40:47.734
- Oh, it was my pleasure.

40:47.767 --> 40:48.767
- Bri, Kate.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.066
- Go ahead.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.467
- Go ahead and knock off.

40:51.500 --> 40:52.600
- Good night.
- Good night.

40:52.633 --> 40:54.500
- Time to go to bed.

41:07.133 --> 41:08.633
- That's good
that you guys are talking.

41:08.667 --> 41:11.266
- Yeah.

41:11.266 --> 41:13.266
- It's funny to me
that I'm trying

41:13.300 --> 41:15.266
to distance myself
from my problems at home.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.066
He's trying to
pull closer to them.

41:21.033 --> 41:23.000
- That was something else.

41:23.033 --> 41:25.266
- That was f---ing awesome.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.266
Why do you look
like you're upset about that?

41:27.300 --> 41:28.400
You did great.

41:28.433 --> 41:29.533
- [scoffs]
- What?

41:29.533 --> 41:31.400
- What is that eye?

41:31.400 --> 41:32.767
- I mean, you have to be
in a mood to be the mascot.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
- You weren't in the mood?

41:34.033 --> 41:35.000
- Come on.
- No.

41:35.033 --> 41:36.266
- Good job, Jen.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.000
- Ugh, thanks.

41:38.033 --> 41:40.266
- I think these guests had
a lovely charter, don't you?

41:40.300 --> 41:42.300
Captain Lee had a great time.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.667
- I'm always in the dark.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.400
- What do you feel
in the dark about?

41:45.433 --> 41:47.633
There's nothing
we're not telling you.

41:47.667 --> 41:49.400
- What do you think
I'm not telling you?

41:49.433 --> 41:51.400
It totally annoys me
when Jen sasses me,

41:51.433 --> 41:53.133
because I just want
a thank you and not attitude.

41:53.166 --> 41:56.033
I want you to fill this
with orange juice.

41:56.033 --> 41:57.433
I want this with orange juice.

41:57.467 --> 41:58.633
I want you to pull
for breakfast.

41:58.667 --> 42:00.133
- Is it necessary to--

42:00.166 --> 42:02.033
- You need to just
stop talking,

42:02.033 --> 42:04.033
because I need to go to bed,
or I'm gonna tap out.

42:04.066 --> 42:08.367
Pull for breakfast,
clear this sh-- out.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.400
- It's 1:15, I'm going.

42:09.433 --> 42:10.433
You're on your own.

42:10.467 --> 42:12.367
This is the fifth charter.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.033
If you don't have it by now,
there's no hope for you.

42:14.033 --> 42:15.700
Figure it out, clean it,
pull for breakfast.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.567
Make everything happy.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.400
- She's out to make my life
a living hell,

42:19.433 --> 42:21.467
and I don't know why.

42:21.467 --> 42:23.700
It's kind of f---ed up,
if you ask me.

42:23.734 --> 42:25.567
At this point, like,
I don't know

42:25.600 --> 42:27.500
if I can work
with these people.

42:30.100 --> 42:31.467
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:31.500 --> 42:33.066
- [gasps]
- Oh.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.533
[cheering]

42:34.567 --> 42:36.600
- Really excited
to have a day off.

42:36.600 --> 42:39.533
- Bobby Lowe has recently
got engaged to his fiancé.

42:39.567 --> 42:40.667
- She's dating him?

42:40.700 --> 42:42.433
I thought that was her grandpa.

42:42.467 --> 42:43.600
- More champagne.

42:43.633 --> 42:45.433
- Come on, guys,
no time to waste.

42:45.467 --> 42:47.333
Can you do
a frozen skinny margarita?

42:47.367 --> 42:48.600
- I hate these people.

42:48.633 --> 42:50.400
- You cut an hour
off of my break.

42:50.433 --> 42:52.734
F--- you,
you stupid f---ing bitch.

42:52.767 --> 42:54.667
Is this good for you?

42:54.700 --> 42:57.066
- My girlfriend is being
really insecure about things.

42:59.033 --> 43:00.667
I know what I'm doing
right now is wrong,

43:00.700 --> 43:02.633
but I don't care.

43:02.633 --> 43:04.500
