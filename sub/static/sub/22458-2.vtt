<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:05.887 --> 00:09.323
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.367 --> 00:13.326
<i>Cos I'm in hell...</i>

00:18.647 --> 00:21.286
You know, Jez,

00:21.327 --> 00:27.243
I've started to get this feeling
that I'm totally, totally fucked.

00:27.287 --> 00:30.962
You know? Everything's fucked.
I fucked my wedding.

00:31.007 --> 00:34.886
I fucked up my only relationship.
Everything's just completely fucked.

00:34.927 --> 00:37.521
You have been feeling this
for a while.

00:37.567 --> 00:41.321
But now I'm starting to think
that maybe that's a good thing,

00:41.367 --> 00:45.963
cos now I can get on and do
everything I've always wanted to do -

00:46.007 --> 00:48.680
join MENSA, learn the clarinet.

00:48.727 --> 00:51.605
- I could be a Scout leader.
- Mm-hm.

00:51.647 --> 00:54.684
What are you smiling for?

00:54.727 --> 00:57.605
Look, Scouting is a noble tradition.

00:57.647 --> 01:01.959
You do not have to be a paedo
to wanna work with children, all right?

01:03.527 --> 01:07.645
Oh, God, that is... I spent five happy
years in the Scouts and never once...

01:07.687 --> 01:10.360
You told me
Kinky Layton was all over you.

01:10.407 --> 01:14.639
Yeah, all right, Layton was a bit of
a paedo, but not in a bad way.

01:14.687 --> 01:17.042
Just boosting you
over the climbing wall,

01:17.087 --> 01:19.885
making you run round the camp
in your pants.

01:19.927 --> 01:23.203
It was old style paedo-ing,
before it got such a bad name.

01:23.247 --> 01:24.805

'Layton only had eyes for
Duncan Carpenter, the doe-eyed flirt. '

01:31.047 --> 01:33.720
'Who's this? And Sophie's dad.

01:33.767 --> 01:36.839
'Angry, tweedy father!
This is a chain-on scenario. '

01:37.847 --> 01:39.041
Hello?

01:39.087 --> 01:41.840
Hi, Jeremy, it's... it's Barney.
Sophie's cousin.

01:41.887 --> 01:43.479
Remember? From the wedding? 

01:43.527 --> 01:44.755
Not really.

01:44.807 --> 01:48.083
We went to the car park
and we smoked that dope that I bought...

01:48.127 --> 01:52.439
- That turned out not to be dope.
- Oh, right. Hi.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.445
We've dropped Sophe off,
she's going back to work tomorrow.

01:55.487 --> 01:56.920
Is this gonna take long?

01:56.967 --> 02:00.039
Oh, no, no, they just wanted me
to deliver this to Mark.

02:00.087 --> 02:02.681
It's just the tuna from the wedding.
It's Mark's half.

02:02.727 --> 02:04.877
Come on, Barney, let's go.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.846
Anyway, I remembered that
you were in a band,

02:08.887 --> 02:12.197
and basically, I've been doing
a little bit of my own music.

02:12.247 --> 02:15.205
Maybe you could take a listen
and tell me what you think?

02:15.247 --> 02:18.876
OK, well, thanks.
Good to see you... Barney!

02:19.967 --> 02:21.446
Thanks, Jeremy!

02:21.487 --> 02:24.285
'Mmm.
Why toast when you can roast? '

02:24.327 --> 02:27.160
Another roast?
That's the third today.

02:27.207 --> 02:31.166
- What's nicer than a roast?
- Yeah, but chain-eating roast?

02:31.207 --> 02:34.643
- Who was that?
- Sophie's dad, and her cousin, Barney.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.040
Barney?

02:36.087 --> 02:37.725
It's the wedding tuna. Your half.

02:37.767 --> 02:41.885
Oh, what? Really? Heartbreak tuna?

02:41.927 --> 02:43.599
Oh, no, Jez, just bin it!

02:43.647 --> 02:47.196
Not literally, there's no need
to be overly dramatic. Freeze it.

02:47.247 --> 02:49.715
See how I feel in six months.

02:49.767 --> 02:54.158
- They came all this way for the tuna? -
They were dropping Sophie off.

02:54.207 --> 02:57.882
- She's going back to work tomorrow.
- Sophie's going back to work?!

02:57.927 --> 03:00.487
That's outside the terms
of the treaty! Six weeks!

03:00.527 --> 03:03.724
Six weeks till we go back!
This isn't six weeks, this is three!

03:03.767 --> 03:06.520
Shit! I've gotta get in there
to stop her lies.

03:06.567 --> 03:08.125
What lies?

03:08.167 --> 03:10.442
That I jilted her at the altar.

03:10.487 --> 03:14.446
Right, technically... I'm on your side,
but, technically, that's not a lie.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.047
I did not jilt her.
Technically, I married her.

03:17.087 --> 03:20.318
Well, maybe, but I think
what sticks in everyone's memory

03:20.367 --> 03:22.039
is the bit where you jilted her.

03:22.087 --> 03:25.841
Oh, shit! If you think that,
what's everyone else gonna think?

03:25.887 --> 03:27.843
Oh, God! I've gotta get in there.

03:27.887 --> 03:32.119
If she wants a PR war, she can have
a PR war. I'll Mandelson her!

03:32.167 --> 03:35.284
Nobody wanted New Labour, but now
we all now how it works.

03:42.527 --> 03:43.926
'Please save me, Jesus!

03:43.967 --> 03:48.040
'I'll believe in you if you save me now.
The other way!

03:48.087 --> 03:51.682
'She's looking the other way.
Thank you, Jesus!

03:51.727 --> 03:54.764
'Although it was 50/50
which way she'd be looking.

03:54.807 --> 03:57.002
'Might need a bit more
to start believing.

03:57.047 --> 04:00.562
'Oh, the gossip mill.
That's right, stare at Hess.

'She's not saying anything!
Brilliant! Good old English reserve. '

04:19.207 --> 04:24.327
Erm, Mark, I just wanna say,
about the wedding and everything...

04:24.367 --> 04:26.483
I think you're a real piece of shit.

04:26.527 --> 04:29.678
Oh... OK...

04:29.727 --> 04:32.480
'That's fair.
Lisa is a very fair person. '

DANCE MUSIC PLAYS

04:36.327 --> 04:37.760
What do you think?

04:37.807 --> 04:40.321
This is raw.
Who is this? Is this us?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.677
It's a simple shit-muncher.
Sophie's cousin.

04:45.127 --> 04:48.642
Shit! He's done something there,
ain't he? How do you do that?

04:48.687 --> 04:50.518
I think that what's happening

04:50.567 --> 04:54.606
is two or maybe three different
musical things all at the same time.

04:54.647 --> 04:59.516
This is the kinda thing
we should be doing.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.285
Complicated shit.

05:01.327 --> 05:05.605
Complicated shit like this - wouldn't
that be against the big beat manifesto?

05:05.647 --> 05:08.719
- You read the big beat manifesto?
- Did we write it down?

05:08.767 --> 05:12.726
The big beat manifesto goes, "Big beats
are the best, get high all the time. "

05:12.767 --> 05:17.636
Right. At the time, it felt like a much
more all-encompassing philosophy.

05:17.687 --> 05:19.006
Can we have this? Can we use it?

05:19.047 --> 05:24.121
Listening to this, it did make me think.
Lately, I've been having some ideas,

05:24.167 --> 05:28.877
and this is exactly the sort of thing
that I was thinking of doing.

05:28.927 --> 05:33.000
- He's nicked your idea?
- Has he? That's what I'm wondering.

05:33.047 --> 05:35.197
Nicked my idea
and then done it back to me.

05:35.247 --> 05:39.320
We should invite him down.
We could teach this kid a thing or two.

05:39.367 --> 05:42.723
Until he arrives,
shall we send this out to promoters?

05:42.767 --> 05:46.919
Yeah. This is the best example
of the stuff we do, we've ever had.

05:46.967 --> 05:51.836
Oh, yeah, cos sometimes it's really hard
actually to do your own ideas.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.521
'OK, grab your nuts, Corrigan.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.717
'First contact.

05:58.767 --> 06:02.123
'There she is. Sophie.
Should I go over?

06:02.167 --> 06:05.204
'Forget the spin war?
Apologise? Stab myself with a fork?

06:05.247 --> 06:08.000
'They only have plastic.

'Oh, crying! Yes, nice

06:10.847 --> 06:14.965

floating voters. Nice tears, Goebbels!

it's like being a nonce in prison. '

Erm... Hello. Is it OK if I go here?

06:40.607 --> 06:42.837
'Please don't call me
a piece of shit. '

06:42.887 --> 06:44.479
Sure, whatever.

06:44.527 --> 06:47.758
I'm Debbie,
but everyone calls me Dobby.

06:47.807 --> 06:51.720
Are you new? I don't think
I've seen you here before, have I?

06:51.767 --> 06:54.486
I'm the IT misfit,
the man with no name!

06:54.527 --> 06:57.599
I'm in and out -
Kettering, Croydon, Aberdeen.

06:57.647 --> 06:59.399
Oh, right. I'm Mark,

06:59.447 --> 07:03.042
but you've probably heard of me
under some other abusive name.

07:03.087 --> 07:04.076
No, why?

07:04.127 --> 07:08.359
Oh, no, just... Everyone
abuses everyone now, don't they?

07:08.407 --> 07:10.875
"Fuck off. Fuck off, you wanker. "

07:10.927 --> 07:13.885
It's supposed to be funny,
but of course it's not.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.520
Wow! You... you carry personal cheese?

07:19.567 --> 07:21.717
Is that allowed?

07:21.767 --> 07:26.318
- I'm a smoker. I need man-Cheddar.
- Right. If you like, you could...

07:26.367 --> 07:31.441
'If I was seen sharing cheese with
a woman, it could be misinterpreted.

07:31.487 --> 07:35.366
'My approval rating would drop through
the floor. It looks like she gnaws it. '

07:35.407 --> 07:39.605
I'm fine. I think if I ate anything
with any flavour in this room

07:39.647 --> 07:41.717
my body would probably spasm
due to shock!

07:41.767 --> 07:43.166
Right! Yeah.

07:43.207 --> 07:45.437
Oh, by the way,

07:45.487 --> 07:49.002
is it possible to easily put a block on
a couple of e-mail addresses?

07:49.047 --> 07:50.446
Why, what you been getting?

07:50.487 --> 07:53.445
Oh, nothing, just some crap.

07:53.487 --> 07:57.321
"You're a piece of shit, shitter.
Stuff your bollocks up your gob. "

07:57.367 --> 07:59.756
It's just mates, and that.

07:59.807 --> 08:01.525
"Fuck off and shut up and die. "

08:01.567 --> 08:03.922
Yeah. They're... They're pretty funny.

08:03.967 --> 08:06.117
Arseholes.

08:06.167 --> 08:10.160
OK, Jeff, Lisa, Paul -
their e-mails are going to junk.

08:10.207 --> 08:11.686
You can check 'em if you want.

08:11.727 --> 08:14.924
Plus, I've put an auto reply
offering them

08:14.967 --> 08:17.561
to come and sit on your hairy dick.

08:17.607 --> 08:20.201
- Joke.
- Oh!

08:20.247 --> 08:25.367
'That's a good joke! She's nice. She's
being nice! I'm pathetically grateful!

08:25.407 --> 08:27.398
'Maybe I should
ask her out for a drink.

08:27.447 --> 08:31.042
'She is a floating voter,
plus she's weirdly attractive.

08:31.087 --> 08:33.476
'No, don't go there, Clinton! '

08:35.486 --> 08:39.082
Oh, wow, this is your room!
This is so cool!

08:39.126 --> 08:42.357
'Think I've found someone
to do my hoovering. '

08:42.407 --> 08:46.036
These your jeans?
These your actual jeans?

08:46.087 --> 08:48.885
Look, this is what I'd look like
wearing your jeans.

08:48.927 --> 08:53.364
"Hi, I'm Jeremy. I've got loads of
girlfriends and hash. Look at my jeans!"

08:54.767 --> 08:56.644
Yeah, that is a bit like me.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.325
 Here we go.

08:58.367 --> 09:01.803
Just typed up a little contract
on Professor Yaffle's computer.

09:01.847 --> 09:03.883
 A contract?

09:03.927 --> 09:09.001
Yeah. It's a standard procedure
for a new band member.

09:09.047 --> 09:13.006
Right. Maybe I should just show that
to my dad's solicitor?

09:13.047 --> 09:14.560
No! No, no.

09:14.607 --> 09:18.156
Sign it,
and we can talk about it later.

09:18.207 --> 09:20.641
Before you sign it,
it's all a lot of waffle.

09:20.687 --> 09:22.279
Hey...

09:22.327 --> 09:25.683
Barney? Is it? What are you doing here?
What's going on?

09:25.727 --> 09:28.446
Barney's staying over for a bit.
He's joined the band.

09:28.487 --> 09:30.478
What?

09:30.527 --> 09:34.759
Actually, these guys were saying they
wouldn't mind some cheese McCoy's.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.241
Do you want me
to get you anything from the shop?

09:37.287 --> 09:39.323
No, I think I'm fine, actually.

09:39.367 --> 09:43.121
While you're down there,
how about some Ribena and a Twirl?

09:43.167 --> 09:47.558
OK. McCoy's, Ribena and Twirl.
I'll go grab my jacket.

09:49.047 --> 09:53.165
Jeremy,
he's Sophie's cousin, for God's sake!

09:53.207 --> 09:57.439
- You're sleeping with the enemy!
- Oh, relax, Mark, it's fine!

09:57.487 --> 10:01.162
Mark, they want me to
sign this contract. Should I sign it?

10:01.207 --> 10:04.802
<i>Not even sure where you'd sign it.
Is that meant to be a dotted line?</i>

10:04.847 --> 10:09.079
Who drew this up? A lot of these
aren't proper sentences.

10:09.127 --> 10:12.437
It's legalese, all right?
Keep your beak out.

10:12.487 --> 10:16.275
Look, Mark, we heard today
we've got a spot at the Fuck Bunker.

10:16.327 --> 10:18.318
The Fuck Bunker?

10:18.367 --> 10:22.485
Yes. And we've got a A&R man coming,
so we need to have a contract.

10:22.527 --> 10:24.438
Everything nice and tied down, yeah?

10:24.487 --> 10:26.876
Right, fine, I don't give a shit.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.839
Looks good to me, Barney.
Go for it, dude

10:29.887 --> 10:33.641
Cool. McCoy's, Ribena and a Twirl.

10:33.687 --> 10:37.236
McCoy's, Ribena and a Twirl.
McCoy's, Ribena and a Twirl...

10:37.287 --> 10:39.437
He's not sucking you off, is he?

10:39.487 --> 10:41.478
No, of course he isn't!

10:41.527 --> 10:43.722
Probably would.

10:43.767 --> 10:47.601
You've to be careful, asking someone to
get you a Twirl who'd also suck you off.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.046
'Still...

10:49.087 --> 10:51.043
'blow job and a Twirl. '

10:54.167 --> 10:57.443
'Got the nod, the mark of the human.

10:57.487 --> 11:01.366
'I'm a human, you're a human.
What else is there to say? '

11:01.407 --> 11:02.886
Hi, Mark. Nice to see you.

11:02.927 --> 11:04.599
Dobby, likewise.

11:04.647 --> 11:08.765
There's meant to be
a bunch of USB sticks here, but...

11:08.807 --> 11:11.275
'God, there's an atmosphere.

11:11.327 --> 11:15.400
'Sexual tension? Or just
misfit scared of sexual tension? '

DOOR CLOSES
Ooh, er!

11:18.207 --> 11:22.325

- Oh, I can't reach. Could you?
- Er, yeah, sure.

11:27.047 --> 11:28.605
Erm, you'll...

11:30.127 --> 11:35.247
- You'll have to... move.
- Yeah, I should move, but...

11:35.287 --> 11:37.926
I might not move.

11:39.607 --> 11:42.599
'Ls she shifting her bum
against my area? '

11:42.647 --> 11:46.925
Er, are you, are you... sure you don't
wanna get out of the way?

11:46.967 --> 11:48.400
I'm all right.

11:48.447 --> 11:51.962
'What if someone comes in?
Should step away.

11:52.007 --> 11:53.725
'Step away from the bum.

11:53.767 --> 11:57.726
'Bit impolite to step away.
I don't want to step away. '

11:57.767 --> 12:02.557
- I've got some feta today.
- Oh, feta?

12:02.607 --> 12:05.121
Er, that's a sheep's cheese,
isn't it?

12:05.167 --> 12:09.604
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah, I believe so...

12:09.647 --> 12:12.207
Or... Or goat's...

12:12.247 --> 12:14.920
'This is possibly
the most exciting thing

12:14.967 --> 12:16.844
'that has happened to anyone ever!

12:16.887 --> 12:18.878
'Does she know what she's doing?

12:18.927 --> 12:21.600
'Ls she just innocently
waggling her bum around

12:21.647 --> 12:25.560
'and I'm getting illegal benefit?
I'm not doing a sexual assault, am I?

12:25.607 --> 12:28.963
'You can't do a sexual assault
if you stay still, like a statue.

12:29.007 --> 12:30.599
'I'm just a statue.

12:30.647 --> 12:32.956
'A dirty, filthy statue!

12:33.007 --> 12:37.523
'Oh, God! I'm getting very... Captain
Corrigan is flying without a licence!

12:37.567 --> 12:40.206
'Oh, Jesus! It's too much.
I'm gonna blow my beans!

12:40.247 --> 12:42.203
'I'm gonna do a Chesil Beach!

12:42.247 --> 12:44.283
'Don't let her know! '

12:44.327 --> 12:46.602
- Ah, ah!
- Are you OK?

12:46.647 --> 12:51.357
I'm fine, er, but... Sorry...
I should be going,

12:51.407 --> 12:55.320
cos, you know,
the world turns on its axis.

12:55.367 --> 12:58.245
One man works while
another relaxes.

12:58.287 --> 13:01.279
Ah, Post-Its.

13:01.327 --> 13:02.885
Bye.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.562
'Er, did she notice?

13:07.607 --> 13:10.041
'Should have stayed for at least a snog,

13:10.087 --> 13:13.477
'but my interest level
just dropped straight off.

'God, it's soggy down there!
It's gonna start chafing.

'Need to clean up. Need to get out.

'Shit! Elaine and Michael. They'll
probably wanna talk quarterly sales.

'Fire exit. Could bust out here
and out into the car park.

13:28.807 --> 13:29.876
'Fuck! '

13:29.927 --> 13:33.078
- Hey, it's the wedding crasher!
- Hello, you two.

13:33.127 --> 13:36.722
'Oh, she's smoking a joint with her ex,
when we should be newlyweds,

13:36.767 --> 13:40.442
'remorselessly working our way
through The Lovers' Guide. '

13:40.487 --> 13:44.116
Hi, Sophe, how are you?
How are you... feeling?

13:44.167 --> 13:47.045
Well,
I want to give things another go.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.315
You do?

13:48.367 --> 13:50.835
No, of course I fucking don't!

13:50.887 --> 13:52.559
THEY LAUGH

13:52.607 --> 13:54.245
Oh, that was funny, though.

13:54.287 --> 13:57.962
- We should talk about divorce options.
- Yeah, maybe not...

13:58.007 --> 14:01.522
'while I'm in spermy pants
and you're high. '... here.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.717
Whatever, Mark. Run away again.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.520
I'm having a laugh - a-hah! -
so I don't really give a toss.

14:06.567 --> 14:10.879
What you doing out here, anyway, Mark?
And what's that on your trousers?

14:10.927 --> 14:13.725
'Oh, God! It's seeping through! '

14:13.767 --> 14:16.156
Have you... pissed yourself?

14:16.207 --> 14:17.720
Er...

14:17.767 --> 14:25.196
Yeah. Yeah, I did a little bit
of wee on myself, so...

14:25.247 --> 14:27.807
THEY GIGGLE

14:27.847 --> 14:30.077
You twat!

14:30.127 --> 14:32.118
THEY LAUGH

14:35.407 --> 14:39.446
'Oh, yeah, they can laugh, but I win
because they think I pissed myself!

14:39.487 --> 14:42.445
'They've no clue
I came all in my pants! '

14:42.487 --> 14:43.715
 Ahem!

14:43.767 --> 14:45.041
Anything?

14:45.087 --> 14:46.486
Can I have a sandwich?

14:46.527 --> 14:48.677
Oh, dude, what? Come on.

14:48.727 --> 14:52.003
We need more tracks for the gig.
Good ones.

14:52.047 --> 14:55.084
I know, but it's hard
to be creative when you're hungry.

14:55.127 --> 14:58.244
How long can it take to come up with
three minutes of music?

14:58.287 --> 14:59.276
Six minutes, max.

14:59.327 --> 15:02.364
That's being generous.
That's two minutes per minute.

15:02.407 --> 15:05.479
 Can I have an apple?
- Do you think I'm made of apples?

15:05.527 --> 15:07.279
All right. You can have a poppadom.

15:07.327 --> 15:09.761
You can have one poppadom
and a bit of chutney.

15:09.807 --> 15:11.160
Cool, thanks.

15:11.207 --> 15:14.643
'I'm so generous.
I'm like a techno-Ghandi. '

15:14.687 --> 15:18.965
Oi, was thinking about what Mark
said the other day about Barney?

15:19.007 --> 15:20.963
- Bet you would, wouldn't you?
- What?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.360
Suck one of us off.

15:24.247 --> 15:26.442
No, no. I wouldn't.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.682
What if we said
you couldn't be in the band

15:28.727 --> 15:30.445
unless you sucked one of us off?

15:30.487 --> 15:32.682
No! No, I wouldn't.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.161
You had to think twice,
though, didn't you?

15:35.207 --> 15:36.765
No, I didn't, honestly.

15:36.807 --> 15:40.800
Which one of us, then? If you had
to pick, which one would you pick?

15:40.847 --> 15:42.917
Go on! If you had to?

15:42.967 --> 15:45.527
All right, OK, I guess, then,
if I had to pick...

15:45.567 --> 15:49.799
- It would be Super Hans.
- I knew you would. Who wouldn't?

15:49.847 --> 15:53.556
You'd suck Super Hans off?
That is so funny.

15:53.607 --> 15:54.642
'Screw them!

15:54.687 --> 15:58.316
'I'll just keep trying to suck
myself off. I'll get there eventually. '

16:00.967 --> 16:04.198
'Dobby, my cupboard lover.
Stationery sex queen.

16:04.247 --> 16:07.683
'I can't ask her out,
I'll be dead in the PR water.

'Oh, don't think about it.

'Just drink buckets of tea.

wife!" She has gone beyond now.

16:18.087 --> 16:20.317
'That is too much.
That is way over the line.

'Maybe I'll stick it back to Harpenden,
Harpenden, Harpenden,

'see how she likes that! '

16:26.087 --> 16:28.237
'No, can't we
leave the mugs out of it?

16:28.287 --> 16:31.359
'Even the Mob never hit the families. '

16:31.407 --> 16:34.444
So it's true. I heard about the rumours
but I couldn't believe it.

16:34.487 --> 16:37.399
I'm so sorry about your mug, Mark.

16:37.447 --> 16:40.359
So you know Sophie's behaviour's
become unacceptable.

16:40.407 --> 16:42.238
I've instructed her to take a break.

16:42.287 --> 16:45.199
She'll spend time with her parents...
in the country.

16:45.247 --> 16:47.681
Right. Wow!

16:47.727 --> 16:50.287
'Oh, my God!
This is piggin' massive.

16:50.327 --> 16:52.522
'I've won the spin war. '

16:52.567 --> 16:54.319
Would you like to?

16:54.367 --> 16:56.597
Smash it? Er, thank you, but no.

16:56.647 --> 16:58.126
Very well.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.924
I can't believe I let this
happen on my watch.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.606
'Right, Dobby.
Who cares what people think?

17:05.646 --> 17:08.080
'I'm back, baby. The bitch is back. '

17:10.527 --> 17:12.518
Hey, Dobs!

17:12.567 --> 17:16.924
I just wondered if you fancied coming
down with me to the Fuck Bunker...

17:16.967 --> 17:20.436
- Is that the stationery cupboard?
- No! God, no!

17:20.487 --> 17:22.079
No, no... It's a venue.

17:22.127 --> 17:25.403
My mate's playing
a gig down there on Friday,

17:25.446 --> 17:28.358
and I thought it might be to cool
to swing by and check it out.

17:28.406 --> 17:31.479
Your mate's playing a gig.
Check it out.

17:31.527 --> 17:36.078
Mark, you're not trying to pretend
you're a normal human being, are you?

17:36.127 --> 17:40.279
'She's the one! Oh, Dobby,
let me chew on your weird hair! '

17:42.527 --> 17:45.325
'I wonder if the A&R guy's
here yet.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.846
'Which one could he be?

17:46.887 --> 17:49.799
'Could be him. Perfect cover.

17:49.847 --> 17:52.042
'Or her.

17:52.087 --> 17:54.237
'Or her. Lot of women here.

17:54.287 --> 18:00.078
'Hmm. Women, there they are, walking
around, and they've all got them -

18:00.127 --> 18:05.599
'under their clothes, hiding there,
but I know the secret.

18:05.647 --> 18:07.603
'Vaginas.

'She's got one.

18:16.447 --> 18:18.915
'She's definitely got one. '

18:20.487 --> 18:25.436
'She's trying to make out she hasn't
got one, but I know she has.

18:25.487 --> 18:29.241
'Got to stop thinking about vaginas.
It's my big night.

18:29.287 --> 18:31.403
'Mmm, vaginas. '

18:31.447 --> 18:34.883
- Come on, open up, it's gig time.
- What's going on?

18:34.927 --> 18:37.202
Barney's locked himself
in the bloody bog.

18:37.247 --> 18:40.319
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing. Jesus!

18:40.367 --> 18:41.561
He's a fucker! 

18:41.607 --> 18:43.882
Has he been sucking you off?

18:43.927 --> 18:45.280
No, course not.

18:45.327 --> 18:47.158
Yes. 

18:47.207 --> 18:48.435
Well, maybe once.

18:48.487 --> 18:50.159
What the fuck are we gonna do?

18:50.207 --> 18:54.405
We don't know how to play his...
our music. We're the frontmen.

18:54.447 --> 18:57.917
I was planning on waving a maraca
and giving the hotties my sex eyes.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.242
Why the hell did you get him
to suck you off?

19:00.287 --> 19:03.040
I dunno, do I?
I was just bored. It's rock'n'roll.

19:03.087 --> 19:05.885
We're backstage.
Someone's gotta suck someone off.

19:05.927 --> 19:10.000
Iggy, Bowie, Lou Reid, TuPac...
They're all sucking each other off.

19:10.047 --> 19:11.196
 You're on!

19:11.247 --> 19:14.603
Shit! We're on!
What... What are we gonna do?

19:14.647 --> 19:17.957
Barney? Barney,
come on out, mate. Please.

19:18.007 --> 19:20.601
You go out, keep the crowd happy.
I'll sort Barney out.

19:20.647 --> 19:22.478
All right. All right.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.563
Just don't... don't suck him off.

19:24.607 --> 19:27.405
All right?
And don't make him suck you off.

19:27.447 --> 19:30.405
Just get him out there
without any more sucking off!

19:31.887 --> 19:35.084
Two bottles of premium lager
and two double whiskies, please.

19:35.127 --> 19:37.402
'Don't keep the change! '

19:37.447 --> 19:39.483
Ah, good old alcohol.

19:39.527 --> 19:42.280
Facilitates the talking of shite!

19:42.327 --> 19:45.797
Long term, there's depression,
lethargy and addiction.

19:45.847 --> 19:47.963
But who's looking to the long term?

19:48.007 --> 19:49.804
CHEERING

19:49.847 --> 19:53.886
Hey, everyone.
So, great, we're almost ready,

19:53.927 --> 19:56.361
but before we... rock you...

19:56.407 --> 20:00.116
<i>erm... we need to find out...
are you ready?</i>

20:00.167 --> 20:01.725
Yeah!

20:01.767 --> 20:02.882
 Yeah, OK!

20:02.927 --> 20:07.079
But are you really...
Are you really, really, really ready?

20:07.127 --> 20:08.765
Yeah!

20:08.807 --> 20:11.367
Great, you're really... you're ready.

20:11.407 --> 20:13.682
So... Yeah, yeah,
so you're ready to party.

20:13.727 --> 20:16.161
OK, we know that now.
But my next question is...

20:16.207 --> 20:17.799
'What is he saying? '

20:17.847 --> 20:23.479
Are you ready to party hard,
right here, right now?

20:23.527 --> 20:25.677
 'He's just talking words
out of his mouth. '

20:25.727 --> 20:27.080
Mega.

20:28.767 --> 20:33.158
Wow, the ladies. Nice to see it's
almost as disgusting as the gents.

20:33.207 --> 20:36.438
It used to be all pink and tidy
but then feminism happened

20:36.487 --> 20:38.796
and we all just started
pissing on the floor.

20:38.847 --> 20:40.997
Of course, girl power.

20:41.047 --> 20:44.278
'Wow, this is better than
watching Jeremy dying on stage.

20:44.327 --> 20:48.445
'She really seems to have
a thing about confined spaces.

20:48.487 --> 20:50.682
'Just hope I don't go off
in my pants again. '

20:50.727 --> 20:53.321
VOMITING
 What's that?

20:53.367 --> 20:56.165
It's a nightclub, it's normal.

20:56.207 --> 20:58.323
She's... she's probably on drugs.

20:58.367 --> 21:01.598
She's probably having
the time of her life.

21:01.647 --> 21:04.320
'Oh, God! I know that boot.

21:04.367 --> 21:07.837
'I know that foot.
I know that crying sound. '

21:07.887 --> 21:11.641
Mark, I really think we should check
on her. She might have passed out.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.996
No, Dobby! Hold on, no, Dobby!

21:14.047 --> 21:16.003
Mark!

21:16.047 --> 21:18.003
Hi, Sophie.

21:18.047 --> 21:19.924
 You know her?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

21:19.967 --> 21:22.640
I'm his wife.

21:22.687 --> 21:27.203
She doesn't know what she's saying.
She's off her head on street drugs.

21:27.247 --> 21:29.602
What have you taken, Sophie?

21:29.647 --> 21:32.207
Who knows? Who the fuck cares?

21:32.247 --> 21:33.726
What are you even doing here?

21:33.767 --> 21:36.122
I thought you were staying
with your parents.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.920
I ran away from home
to see Barney, thanks, dickhead.

21:38.967 --> 21:41.276
Sophe, please.

21:41.327 --> 21:44.876
We are a bit married,
but not properly.

21:44.927 --> 21:46.804
It was never consummated.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.236
And you're not gonna
get Nana's cottage,

21:49.287 --> 21:51.243
so you can shove it
up your arsehole!

21:51.287 --> 21:52.720
OK, I'm gonna head off.

21:52.767 --> 21:53.961
But, Dobby, I...

21:54.007 --> 21:58.364
'I've been caught out, like
Angus Deayton or Harold Shipman. '

22:00.287 --> 22:04.075
You're like
a life-support machine, Mark.

22:04.127 --> 22:06.880
Well... Thank you, Sophie.

22:06.927 --> 22:09.964
Except instead of giving life
you suck it all out of people!

22:10.007 --> 22:11.998
'My beautiful wife. '

22:12.047 --> 22:15.881
I wanna go home. I wanna go home.
I wanna go home. I wanna go home.

22:15.927 --> 22:18.760
I wanna go home. I wanna go home.
I wanna go home.

22:19.367 --> 22:21.927
- What's going on?
- He wants to go home.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.276
I'll take care of him,
thank you very much.

22:24.327 --> 22:27.364
All right, grandad, hold on.
Can't they give us ten?

22:27.407 --> 22:31.286
He's in a K-hole right now,
but in ten the speed'll kick in.

22:31.327 --> 22:33.921
Can of Coke and a ciggie,
he'll be right as rain.

22:33.967 --> 22:35.400
I don't wanna sit down.

22:35.447 --> 22:37.642
I wanna run behind the car
all the way home.

22:37.687 --> 22:38.881
We've missed our slot.

22:38.927 --> 22:42.840
Dance Witch Abortion are on now
and they're rocking out.

22:42.887 --> 22:46.323
- Ah, Mark, of course.
- I'm so sorry about all this, Ian.

22:46.367 --> 22:50.679
'Lan? He is Ian, isn't he?
Suppose now I've jilted his daughter

22:50.727 --> 22:54.515
'I could call him Captain Cockring
and it wouldn't make things worse. '

22:54.567 --> 22:58.879
- Super Hans, did I do it right?
- Yeah, yeah, you did it fine.

22:58.927 --> 23:00.155
What did you do to him?

23:00.207 --> 23:01.435
You've ruined this. 

23:01.487 --> 23:04.445
<i>Why couldn't you have got him
to suck you off after the gig?</i>

23:04.487 --> 23:06.318
He did what?! 

23:06.367 --> 23:11.122
Barney? What makes you
do these things, Mark?

23:11.167 --> 23:14.079
I'm not the one he sucked off!

23:14.127 --> 23:16.243
I hate you, Mark.
I fucking hate you.

23:16.287 --> 23:18.960
Super Hans! I love you.
Don't leave me!

23:19.007 --> 23:23.205
He's not all he's cracked up to be.
Who's the really cool one?

23:23.247 --> 23:27.286
You should look a bit deeper before
you go sucking someone off next time.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.516
Prick.

23:30.567 --> 23:33.001
'OK, what now?

23:33.047 --> 23:35.641
'Go home and roast
the shit out of some meat. '
