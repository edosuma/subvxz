05:22.405 --> 05:26.867
the old guys with their tattoos

05:26.868 --> 05:28.744
Yeah, the old people,

05:28.745 --> 05:30.163
a lot of them have passed on.

05:30.164 --> 05:31.872
I hear no more skulls.

05:31.873 --> 05:36.669
They made them put the skulls away.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.337
<i>The Iban once enjoyed a

<i>a different journey.</i>

06:03.322 --> 06:06.032
Basically the tattoos signify knowledge

06:06.033 --> 06:08.450
and the wealth they brought
back to the longhouse,

06:08.451 --> 06:12.663
what you probably would want to get is a...

06:12.664 --> 06:13.831
Something like this.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.125
Ah, like that. Yeah.
