08:08.227 --> 08:10.468
Give it over, Michael.

08:12.481 --> 08:13.761
Thanks.

08:17.277 --> 08:18.440
Rose!

08:22.324 --> 08:24.151
- Yours?
- Aye.

08:24.243 --> 08:26.484
My dad got it when they
sold up Lady Pawson's.

08:26.578 --> 08:28.322
Lady Pawson, is it?

08:32.251 --> 08:35.168
Fine fish, Michael.

08:35.254 --> 08:39.251
Give him a smile and you'll maybe
get one of the claws for your supper.

08:45.013 --> 08:46.342
Michael!

08:46.432 --> 08:50.429
I've told you, Michael,
they're created creatures!

08:52.855 --> 08:54.479
Get off!

08:54.565 --> 08:56.356
It'll make me sick!

09:04.032 --> 09:06.737
Poor Mike's no answer to
a young maid's dreams...

09:06.827 --> 09:09.947
but do you not think he
just possibly knows that?

09:10.038 --> 09:12.660
I can't abide him, Father Hugh.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.539
You used to ride to
school on his back.

09:15.627 --> 09:18.498
- I can walk for myself now.
- Aye.

09:18.589 --> 09:22.040
Where are you walking this
afternoon dressed up like that?

09:22.134 --> 09:25.218
- Nowhere precisely.
- Just so.

09:25.763 --> 09:29.630
What do you do, Rose, mooning
about all day by yourself?

09:30.517 --> 09:31.846
Read.

09:41.987 --> 09:46.614
- Well, I wasn't really reading it.
- You're doing nothing, then?

09:47.785 --> 09:51.236
- I suppose so.
- Have you nothing to do?

09:52.080 --> 09:53.824
Precisely that!

09:55.584 --> 09:58.918
Well, Miss Precisely, that's a pity.

09:59.922 --> 10:02.958
Doing nothing is a
dangerous occupation!

10:56.728 --> 10:57.760
Morning.

11:00.566 --> 11:04.017
- Blowy day?
- That's right, Corporal.

11:04.111 --> 11:05.486
It's the wind.

11:07.281 --> 11:08.858
Only want to be friendly, kids.

11:08.949 --> 11:12.365
Then go back to London
and write us a letter.

11:13.620 --> 11:16.491
- Don't come from London, love.
- Go anyway.

11:27.009 --> 11:30.342
- Morning, Mr. O'Connor.
- Good morning to you, Corporal.

11:30.554 --> 11:32.712
Will you listen to that now?

11:33.265 --> 11:37.974
Aren't the police a dirty lot,
hobnobbing with the British soldiers?

11:38.061 --> 11:40.731
I heard that, Maureen Cassidy.

11:40.814 --> 11:44.515
You were meant to, Constable O'Connor.

11:45.611 --> 11:48.695
Hey, Michael!

11:48.781 --> 11:52.363
Michael, darling, show us your fish.

11:55.537 --> 11:58.028
How much does he weigh then, Mike?

12:03.045 --> 12:05.536
How long is it, Michael?

12:05.631 --> 12:08.715
I've never seen a
lobster the equal of that.

12:09.051 --> 12:13.380
- Michael, can I touch it?
- Come here and show it to us, Michael.

12:13.472 --> 12:14.800
Michael.

13:06.942 --> 13:09.647
Now what? Now what?

13:17.578 --> 13:20.744
What am I to do with you? What?

13:20.831 --> 13:23.583
- Actually it's only a bit of fun, Father.
- Fun?

13:23.667 --> 13:27.665
Are you brainless,
Maureen Cassidy, or what?

13:31.508 --> 13:32.587
Fun.

13:33.010 --> 13:36.842
Devil take me if the lot of
you is not possessed and damned.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.840
I don't know what's the matter
with the youngsters in this place.

15:18.866 --> 15:19.945
I don't at all.

15:20.033 --> 15:24.992
Their talk is filthy, their doings
are secret, and cruelty for fun.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.449
Unemployment is the matter
with them, Father Hugh.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.163
It's the deliberate policy
of the British government...

15:31.253 --> 15:33.625
that Irish youngsters
shall corrupt in idleness.

15:33.714 --> 15:35.671
Well, it's working fine.

15:37.509 --> 15:40.546
I just seen your Rosy
loafing about the beach again.

15:42.055 --> 15:44.807
How much you give for
that black lace umbrella?

15:45.267 --> 15:46.761
Three and six.

15:48.353 --> 15:50.061
You'll ruin that girl.

15:50.564 --> 15:54.775
It's time she had a fellow of her own,
Tom. A house of her own. Floors to scrub.

15:54.860 --> 15:58.311
My princess isn't interested
in fellows, Father.

15:59.198 --> 16:02.152
Your princess has
fellows enough in here.

16:02.659 --> 16:05.179
And fellows running loose in
there will do a girl more damage...

16:05.204 --> 16:07.825
than a barrack full of drunk dragoons.

16:08.499 --> 16:09.779
Well...

16:09.875 --> 16:14.501
if there's one of that lot as is fit for
her, maybe you'll point him out, Father.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.601
Rose.

16:40.739 --> 16:42.483
Mr. Shaughnessy.

16:43.992 --> 16:45.321
Well...

16:46.370 --> 16:48.078
this is nice, Rose.

16:48.163 --> 16:50.868
Well, you're back, then?

16:50.958 --> 16:52.915
Yes, I'm back, and I...

17:04.805 --> 17:06.215
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

17:15.691 --> 17:17.933
I came to meet you.

17:18.026 --> 17:19.569
Well, that was kind.

17:20.529 --> 17:23.897
A party of us went to a couple
of concerts while we were there.

17:23.991 --> 17:26.695
I saved you the programs.

17:29.455 --> 17:33.915
- "The Royal Philharmonic."
- Berlioz and Tchaikovsky.

17:34.001 --> 17:37.085
- No Beethoven?
- No Beethoven.

17:37.171 --> 17:39.543
Do you know that the British
government has got a law now...

17:39.631 --> 17:42.301
- forbidding the playing of German music?
- No.

17:42.384 --> 17:45.919
- Can you imagine such foolishness?
- British.

17:46.013 --> 17:48.930
Well, all governments
is foolish, more or less.

17:49.016 --> 17:51.305
An Irish government would be the same.

17:51.393 --> 17:53.849
Well, maybe.

17:54.354 --> 17:55.979
Thank you.

17:58.609 --> 18:02.357
- You enjoyed yourself in Dublin, then?
- Well, I did and I didn't.

18:02.446 --> 18:05.897
A conference of village school
teachers, you know, is not exactly a...

18:05.991 --> 18:09.158
- Bacchanalia?
- Bacchanalia. Precisely.

18:10.204 --> 18:12.492
We did have some interesting
discussions, though.

18:12.581 --> 18:16.958
There was a lady teacher among us
from Belfast, a stimulating woman.

18:17.085 --> 18:18.117
Oh.

18:19.630 --> 18:22.465
- Did she come to the concert?
- She had the score.

18:25.636 --> 18:29.336
In what way, precisely,
was she stimulating?

18:29.431 --> 18:33.678
She had a fine and fresh mind,
Rose. Very modern in her thoughts.

18:34.228 --> 18:36.897
She'd been at the
teaching for over 50 years.

18:38.690 --> 18:42.688
Old folk with fresh minds
are very stimulating.

18:42.778 --> 18:46.361
Then there was a ministry
inspector, he gave us an address...

18:59.419 --> 19:02.337
But the best we had was this
professor from the Sorbonne.

19:02.422 --> 19:04.711
Now, there was a man
with a mind, if you like.

19:04.800 --> 19:08.383
- Why? What did he say?
- I couldn't tell you, Rose.

19:08.470 --> 19:11.175
Whatever it was, it was wasted on us.

19:11.265 --> 19:13.886
Teachers are a poor lot, surely.

19:14.768 --> 19:18.386
If teachers were the poor lot,
like you're always making out...

19:18.480 --> 19:21.481
how would the pupils
be learning such riches?

19:25.821 --> 19:27.315
What?

19:27.406 --> 19:30.027
Some young fellow's
going to be a lucky man.

19:40.419 --> 19:43.752
- Rose?
- I've something in my eye.

19:44.423 --> 19:45.703
Rose.

19:50.846 --> 19:52.257
The nuisance.

19:53.098 --> 19:57.096
- Will I get it out, then?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

19:57.186 --> 19:58.763
It's only the wind.

20:02.399 --> 20:05.317
- Are you away to the schoolhouse, then?
- No, Rose, I think...

20:05.402 --> 20:08.569
I'll scramble up the dunes
and pay my respects to my wife.

20:08.655 --> 20:09.770
Oh, yes.

20:10.324 --> 20:11.604
Good day, Rose.

20:12.159 --> 20:14.068
Good day, Mr. Shaughnessy.

21:52.593 --> 21:54.135
Hello, Michael.

21:58.849 --> 22:01.174
- Shaughnessy.
- There you are, Mr. Shaughnessy.

22:01.268 --> 22:04.103
So, you're back again, Charles.

22:04.188 --> 22:06.679
Home is the voyager,
safe from the sea.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.850
- The usual?
- Thanks.

22:09.234 --> 22:10.314
And...

22:11.069 --> 22:13.311
what did you see in Dublin?

22:13.405 --> 22:16.074
- You mean, the trouble?
- What else?

22:16.158 --> 22:18.067
Well, nothing, really.

22:18.160 --> 22:21.743
- Did you not go and see Sackville Street?
- I passed it, yes.

22:21.830 --> 22:24.321
- Passed it?
- Well, I'll be damned.

22:24.833 --> 22:27.538
What did you see as
you passed it, Charles?

22:27.628 --> 22:30.498
- It did look terrible smashed about, Father.
- It's true, then.

22:30.589 --> 22:32.831
- The Government used guns.
- I've not said that, Father.

22:32.925 --> 22:36.543
All right, you've not said
anything. What did you hear?

22:37.262 --> 22:39.089
I heard they used heavy guns...

22:39.181 --> 22:41.659
like them they're using on the
Western Front against the Germans.

22:41.683 --> 22:43.842
And our poor lads pursued
from house to house...

22:43.936 --> 22:46.012
with not one rifle between three.

22:46.105 --> 22:47.931
Now, if the Germans
had an ounce of sense...

22:48.023 --> 22:49.863
they'd send us guns to
use against the British.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.044
That's treason you're talking.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.977
And friends that are
listening surely to God.

22:53.070 --> 22:57.020
It's foolish, all the same. You'll
blather yourself into jug some day.

22:57.282 --> 23:01.494
Charles, what do they say they'll do
with the lads they've got in prison?

23:02.538 --> 23:04.744
They say they'll hang them, Father.

23:05.666 --> 23:07.409
Good luck to all Irishmen.

23:08.836 --> 23:11.872
Bad luck to the British.
Success to the Germans.

23:11.964 --> 23:13.162
And...

23:13.257 --> 23:15.795
And a very good morning
to you, Corporal.

23:18.137 --> 23:20.378
Two black stouts, please, Mr. Ryan.

23:21.348 --> 23:22.677
And one for yourself?

23:22.766 --> 23:25.684
Well, seeing you're a man
of wealth, Corporal, yes.

23:25.769 --> 23:28.391
- Father?
- No.

23:29.356 --> 23:32.191
- Mr. Shaughnessy? -
Well, I don't mind if I-

23:32.693 --> 23:37.355
No, I'd best be on my way. Term
is starting tomorrow, you know...

23:47.666 --> 23:49.125
It seems the Jerries...

23:49.209 --> 23:52.792
are giving your brave lads out
there a terrible scrimmage, then.

23:53.630 --> 23:54.710
Aye.

23:56.216 --> 23:59.383
You see, Tom, Jerry's
a tougher proposition...

23:59.470 --> 24:01.758
than unarmed Irish children.

24:02.347 --> 24:05.966
So far as I know, Mr. McCardle,
no children were killed.

24:07.102 --> 24:09.391
All right, then. There were.

24:14.568 --> 24:16.608
They get you in this uniform.

24:17.070 --> 24:18.965
You point your gun where
you're told to point it...

24:18.989 --> 24:20.567
and you pull the trigger.

24:20.657 --> 24:22.449
And so does Jerry.

24:24.912 --> 24:26.572
And so would you.

24:31.668 --> 24:35.915
You've seen that place,
Passchendaele, maybe?

24:37.132 --> 24:39.089
No, not Passchendaele.

24:39.176 --> 24:43.043
- You're well out of it, Corporal.
- That's right.

25:59.882 --> 26:02.337
Well, duty calls.

26:03.218 --> 26:05.127
Good day, Charles.

26:10.225 --> 26:11.933
Well, good day.

26:14.855 --> 26:16.479
Welcome home.

26:20.861 --> 26:22.984
Will you imagine that fellow?

26:23.071 --> 26:26.191
A fortnight in Dublin.
Does nothing, sees nothing.

26:26.283 --> 26:29.201
It's working with children,
makes a man childish.

26:29.286 --> 26:32.821
No, it was that wife of his,
knocked all the spirit out of him.

26:32.915 --> 26:34.907
She was a good, pure woman.

26:35.834 --> 26:39.334
- Pure, she was.
- Is that nothing?

26:39.671 --> 26:41.331
Oh, no. No.

27:52.703 --> 27:56.286
Well, did you come to
lend me a hand, then?

28:01.462 --> 28:05.293
Well, now, let's see. For a
start, you could put the kettle on.

28:09.178 --> 28:11.301
I didn't come for that at all.

28:13.432 --> 28:15.259
I've come to say something.

28:17.936 --> 28:20.392
I feel like a child in this place.

28:22.316 --> 28:24.355
And I'm not a child.

28:24.443 --> 28:26.103
Do you know that?

28:29.156 --> 28:30.650
I know that.

28:32.201 --> 28:33.944
Rose, I've...

28:34.787 --> 28:37.159
maybe an idea of what you came to say.

28:37.956 --> 28:39.914
You have no idea at all.

28:41.251 --> 28:44.870
Well, I'm just saying, in case
it helps a bit, I maybe have.

28:53.222 --> 28:54.597
I love you.

29:03.315 --> 29:05.308
- Will you come inside?
- No.

29:06.735 --> 29:08.644
Will you sit down, then?

29:08.737 --> 29:11.062
- Why?
- I'd like to talk to you, Rose.

29:15.577 --> 29:17.784
Well, I know what that means.

29:22.918 --> 29:26.501
Rose, this sort of thing
can come about, you know...

29:26.588 --> 29:29.079
a girl taking a fancy to a teacher.

29:29.174 --> 29:32.424
- Thanks.
- Fancy's all it is, Rose.

29:34.555 --> 29:38.884
Rose, you've mistaken a
penny mirror for the sun.

29:38.976 --> 29:40.518
Do you not see that?

29:40.936 --> 29:44.519
I see you always digging
a low pit for yourself...

29:44.606 --> 29:47.560
when you should be
standing on a heap of pride.

29:56.910 --> 29:58.239
Well, Rose...

29:58.871 --> 30:01.540
your coming here today and
saying what you've said...

30:01.623 --> 30:04.197
is the only cause I've
ever had for pride.

30:06.211 --> 30:09.129
Don't you see, Rose? I
only taught you about...

30:09.214 --> 30:14.042
Byron and Beethoven and Captain Blood.
I'm not one of them fellows myself.

30:14.678 --> 30:17.216
- I'm not daft, you know.
- But you're terribly young.

30:17.306 --> 30:21.303
- Aye, and that's a hanging matter, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

30:30.152 --> 30:31.267
Well, then?

30:34.490 --> 30:37.028
It's not a hanging
matter to be young...

30:37.117 --> 30:41.696
but it maybe should be a hanging
matter for a man of middle age...

30:41.789 --> 30:44.458
to try and steal the
youth from a young girl.

30:44.708 --> 30:49.037
Especially a man like
me and a girl like you.

30:53.342 --> 30:57.422
You were meant for the wide world,
Rose, not this place, not this.

30:57.846 --> 30:59.886
Me, I was born for it.

31:01.725 --> 31:03.350
It wouldn't do, Rose.

31:04.186 --> 31:05.894
I just know it wouldn't.

31:12.569 --> 31:15.736
So you don't want me, then?

31:30.003 --> 31:31.546
Don't want you?

31:32.965 --> 31:35.538
- Yes.
- Oh.

32:15.424 --> 32:19.635
Would you like a fat pheasant,
Constable? It'll cost you nothing.

32:25.225 --> 32:26.388
Whoa.

32:28.604 --> 32:30.146
He recognized you.

32:32.065 --> 32:34.603
- Well, you'll have
to be quick... Shut up!

32:48.207 --> 32:49.867
Bring the cart!

32:52.085 --> 32:53.414
Jesus.

34:07.953 --> 34:11.156
- Fine pair of gunrunners we are.
- Come on.

34:48.994 --> 34:51.117
We'll never walk to
the coast, Commandant.

34:51.205 --> 34:54.206
- It's 200 miles.
- We'll walk to Limerick.

34:54.291 --> 34:56.864
- Limerick?
- The lads are waiting for us.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.286
- Oh.
- And cheer up, Pat.

34:59.379 --> 35:01.621
They're waiting with a lorry.

35:27.699 --> 35:29.324
About 30 fellows.

36:04.403 --> 36:05.482
Now...

36:06.363 --> 36:10.610
marriage is a sacrament ordained
by God. That means, Rosy...

36:10.701 --> 36:14.699
once it's done, it's not up to me,
nor you, nor Charles. It's done...

36:14.788 --> 36:18.406
- till one or other of you is dead.
- I understand that.

36:20.043 --> 36:22.534
God ordained it for three reasons.

36:23.172 --> 36:27.121
First, that Charles and you should
be a comfort to each other...

36:27.217 --> 36:30.551
in the long, dull days
and the weary evenings.

36:30.637 --> 36:32.595
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

36:34.266 --> 36:38.643
Secondly, for the procreation of children,
and to bring them up as good Catholics.

36:38.729 --> 36:40.805
- Well, you understand that.
- Yes.

36:41.690 --> 36:43.481
And, thirdly...

36:43.567 --> 36:46.936
- for the satisfaction of the flesh.
- Yes.

36:48.071 --> 36:49.981
Are you scared of that?

36:50.783 --> 36:52.158
Yes.

36:52.242 --> 36:56.572
It's nothing to be scared of,
Rosy. A function of the body.

36:58.457 --> 37:01.541
I suppose all girls
is a bit scared before.

37:01.627 --> 37:03.121
And fellows, too.

37:03.212 --> 37:04.955
- Yes?
- Oh, yes.

37:09.676 --> 37:12.084
It will make me a
different person, won't it?

37:12.179 --> 37:16.046
- Marriage?
- No, the satisfaction of the flesh.

37:16.141 --> 37:18.976
That's a gate I have not
been through myself...

37:19.311 --> 37:22.431
but, no, it won't make
you a different person.

37:23.941 --> 37:25.483
I want it to.

37:26.610 --> 37:28.603
Child, what are you expecting?

37:48.507 --> 37:49.918
Wings, is it?

38:05.482 --> 38:07.724
All right, try it.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.882
Seven boats. All currachs.

38:34.970 --> 38:38.469
One thing at a time. Keep a look out.

38:45.189 --> 38:47.015
Top of the morning, Father.

38:48.567 --> 38:49.812
Morning!

39:02.539 --> 39:04.698
- Morning, Father.
- Morning, tinker.

39:07.211 --> 39:11.789
You'll find nothing much here. It all
gets carried round the head to Killins.

39:11.965 --> 39:13.045
Ah.

39:14.134 --> 39:16.886
- Good luck with it, anyway.
- Thanks, Father.

39:21.391 --> 39:24.677
And if them two's tinkers,
I'm the Bishop of Cork.

39:27.523 --> 39:31.307
Now, we'll have one
light on the beacon...

39:31.777 --> 39:33.485
and one on the cliff.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.858
- What now, then? Back to Dublin?
- Tomorrow.

39:37.866 --> 39:39.658
I want to see what Ryan's like.

39:46.959 --> 39:49.876
Are you not done, Mrs. McCardle?

39:50.754 --> 39:54.538
Easy, Mr. Ryan, dear.
They'll not start without her.

39:55.801 --> 39:56.832
Women.

40:07.104 --> 40:09.974
Tim, did you review the volunteers
in Phoenix Park before the war?

40:10.065 --> 40:12.058
- Yes, why?
- Will you come here?

40:23.954 --> 40:27.121
Aye, you're looking
at me picture, lads.

40:28.584 --> 40:29.829
Here.

40:38.635 --> 40:42.004
You recognize someone?

40:42.848 --> 40:46.299
- That's yourself, landlord.
- It is.

40:46.393 --> 40:48.552
And he that has me by the hand...

40:48.937 --> 40:52.520
- is Commandant Tim O'Leary.
- Never.

40:53.317 --> 40:56.567
Red Tim himself. That
1,000 secret policemen...

40:56.653 --> 40:58.812
have been hunting for
these last five years.

40:58.906 --> 41:02.571
And himself, no doubt at this very moment
walking the broad streets of Dublin.

41:02.659 --> 41:06.491
- He's a brave man, surely.
- Nerves of steel.

41:08.290 --> 41:10.330
You know him well, then?

41:12.669 --> 41:17.545
- I get my orders from time to time.
- Landlord, you're a desperate man.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.053
I'll tell you something.

41:24.473 --> 41:27.676
- Come on then, Mr. Ryan.
- Right, ma'am.

41:28.477 --> 41:30.600
Good luck to the young lady.

41:33.065 --> 41:34.393
Talk.

41:34.483 --> 41:38.563
This whole cursed country
will capsize with talk.

41:46.620 --> 41:49.111
The locals are no good.

41:49.206 --> 41:52.242
I'll have to bring you some
hard lads from Dublin...

41:52.417 --> 41:54.209
when the time comes.

41:54.294 --> 41:57.082
- When will that be, Commandant?
- I don't know.

41:57.464 --> 41:59.789
Depends on our clever lads in Germany.

42:01.260 --> 42:03.548
And they're great talkers, too.

42:18.986 --> 42:21.109
With this ring, I thee wed.

42:23.073 --> 42:24.900
With this ring, I thee wed.

42:25.117 --> 42:27.026
In the name of the Father...

42:27.619 --> 42:28.782
the Son...

42:29.455 --> 42:31.613
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

42:36.128 --> 42:38.797
This gold and silver, I give thee...

42:38.881 --> 42:40.873
token of all my worldly goods.

45:07.780 --> 45:09.819
Good night, Father Hugh.

45:12.326 --> 45:14.235
Good night, Rosy.

45:37.851 --> 45:40.342
Well, is no one going
to kiss the bride?

45:58.372 --> 46:00.199
Steady, lads. Steady!

46:13.387 --> 46:14.846
Get off out of it!

46:30.654 --> 46:32.896
Enough. Now, cut it out.

46:39.037 --> 46:41.659
Now, then. That's
enough. Come on, boys.

46:43.625 --> 46:45.084
That's enough.

46:45.794 --> 46:47.917
Now, lads, that's enough.

47:04.313 --> 47:07.314
- Lucky man, and how are you feeling?
- Lucky.

47:07.399 --> 47:09.308
Are you all right, princess?

47:10.235 --> 47:12.442
It was only their bit of fun.

47:17.701 --> 47:19.445
Good night, Father.

47:20.704 --> 47:22.079
Good night, Rosy.

47:22.164 --> 47:25.449
Now, go on, away in with you.

47:30.005 --> 47:33.291
Well, you'll be away early
in the morning, I suppose?

47:33.383 --> 47:35.423
We will, yes, Mr. Ryan.

49:24.953 --> 49:27.195
You're a wonderful girl, Rose.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.744
No.

49:31.210 --> 49:32.668
No, I'm not.

50:57.546 --> 50:59.704
Charles, how you getting on?

50:59.798 --> 51:02.372
Them fellows has an
elegant sense of humor.

51:07.598 --> 51:09.258
It doesn't matter.

51:38.712 --> 51:41.381
Charles, get a handful of this.

51:56.688 --> 51:58.231
Now, come away.

53:49.384 --> 53:52.255
- Rose?
- Yes?

53:52.346 --> 53:54.054
Are you all right?

53:55.474 --> 53:56.553
Yes.

53:57.726 --> 54:01.142
- Good night, Rose.
- Good night, Charles.

55:27.316 --> 55:28.430
Rose?

55:30.486 --> 55:32.110
I got you these.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.199
They're all growing, see?

55:42.581 --> 55:46.495
- When did you do it?
- Last thing yesterday. Just before church.

55:50.589 --> 55:52.712
Charles, you're a rare man.

55:57.805 --> 55:59.180
Well done.

56:00.265 --> 56:02.507
- Here, no.
- They're not heavy.

56:15.405 --> 56:17.564
I can't believe you're here.

56:18.283 --> 56:19.659
Well, I am.

56:23.163 --> 56:24.492
Well, now.

57:02.494 --> 57:03.870
Beethoven.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.105
I...

58:18.862 --> 58:22.148
I don't think you care
much for my flowers, do you?

58:23.367 --> 58:25.858
I like them better growing, surely.

58:26.036 --> 58:28.871
Well, sure, things are better growing.

59:02.614 --> 59:04.987
I'm afraid you're too
late for snapdragons.

59:05.075 --> 59:08.242
Well, I'll put in some
lilies, then. I like them.

59:10.414 --> 59:14.079
- What's the matter?
- My shirt, Rose. I'd like to get my shirt.

59:14.168 --> 59:16.659
Charles, you're fine as you are.

59:17.880 --> 59:19.457
Well, all right, Rose.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.093
I don't know, Rose,
suppose somebody came in.

59:32.186 --> 59:33.300
Charles.

59:33.979 --> 59:38.107
- You're always on about if someone came.
- Well, it's not decent.

59:38.192 --> 59:40.350
- Decent.
- Well, it's not, you know.

59:41.278 --> 59:42.653
All right, then.

59:48.285 --> 59:50.028
I'm sorry, Charles.

59:50.788 --> 59:51.950
Put it on.

59:52.080 --> 59:53.824
No. What does it matter?

59:56.460 --> 59:59.745
No, you're right. Please, put it on.

59:59.838 --> 01:00:02.625
No, well, I'll be
out again in a minute.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.136
Six ones are six.

01:00:11.225 --> 01:00:13.301
Six twos are twelve.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:16.217
Six threes are eighteen.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.721
Six fours are twenty-four.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.974
Six fives are thirty.

01:00:21.068 --> 01:00:23.191
Six sixes are thirty-six.

01:00:23.278 --> 01:00:25.604
Six sevens are forty-two.

01:00:25.697 --> 01:00:27.773
Six eights are forty-eight.

01:00:27.866 --> 01:00:29.823
- Six nines are...
- Fifty-four.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:31.653
Fifty-four.

01:00:31.745 --> 01:00:33.868
Six tens are sixty.

01:00:33.956 --> 01:00:36.198
Six elevens are sixty-six.

01:00:36.291 --> 01:00:37.916
Six twelves are...

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.414
Seventy-two.

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:46.171
Now, your work is on the board.
You've all got your pencils.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.759
There's no need for talking,
Kathleen. Now get on with it.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:50.926
Get on.

01:00:59.314 --> 01:01:00.394
Rose?

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.381
Rose.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:50.859
- Where are you going, Rosy?
- Nowhere.

01:01:50.949 --> 01:01:53.571
You're in the devil of a hurry there.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.404
Now, stop.

01:01:56.789 --> 01:02:01.118
Now, what exactly is the
trouble between you and Charles?

01:02:01.210 --> 01:02:02.752
No. No trouble.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:06.338
Are you asking me to
believe you're happy?

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:09.590
- I'm not asking you anything.
- Are you happy?

01:02:11.887 --> 01:02:12.918
No.

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:14.962
Why not?

01:02:15.641 --> 01:02:17.301
I don't know.

01:02:17.392 --> 01:02:21.093
- Come on, Rosy, now give me a try.
- I don't.

01:02:21.188 --> 01:02:22.351
All right.

01:02:22.856 --> 01:02:25.478
Because I am stupid and conceited...

01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:28.402
and self-centered and ungrateful
like you've always told me.

01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:30.167
For I have everything
I wanted, have I not?

01:02:30.197 --> 01:02:31.442
You have!

01:02:31.698 --> 01:02:35.613
- What more are you wanting now?
- I don't know that, either.

01:02:35.702 --> 01:02:37.695
- That's a lie.
- It's not.

01:02:39.498 --> 01:02:41.076
How can I know?

01:02:44.086 --> 01:02:46.755
I don't even know what more there is.

01:02:57.808 --> 01:03:01.259
- You've got a good man now, haven't you?
- The best.

01:03:01.353 --> 01:03:03.013
Well?

01:03:03.105 --> 01:03:05.726
And you've got enough
money. Not much, but enough.

01:03:05.816 --> 01:03:06.895
Aye.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:09.569
And you've got your health.

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.313
- You're not sick?
- No.

01:03:11.405 --> 01:03:14.074
There is nothing more,
you graceless girl.

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:16.945
- But, there is.
- There is not.

01:03:17.035 --> 01:03:18.530
I know there is.

01:03:19.788 --> 01:03:22.410
- There must be, Father Hugh.
- Why?

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:26.912
Glory be to God, why must there
be? Because Rosy Ryan wants it?

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.710
Aye.

01:03:46.106 --> 01:03:50.685
Have you got any warm old clothes,
Rosy? Poor Patsy Wheelan's in a bad way.

01:03:51.737 --> 01:03:53.895
I'll find some, Father.

01:03:55.491 --> 01:03:56.736
Thanks.

01:04:04.082 --> 01:04:07.202
Rosy, don't nurse your wishes.

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:10.160
You can't help having them,
but don't nurse them...

01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:13.256
or sure to God, you'll get
what you're wishing for.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:10.659
Major Doryan, sir.

01:06:13.796 --> 01:06:16.333
Sorry, sir, I had to change a wheel.

01:06:21.762 --> 01:06:22.793
Sir.

01:06:58.590 --> 01:06:59.788
Get in.

01:07:01.176 --> 01:07:02.291
In!

01:08:19.755 --> 01:08:21.747
Come on, kids, out of it.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.609
You were in Second Battle of
the Marne, weren't you, sir?

01:08:50.702 --> 01:08:53.372
- Yes.
- So was I, sir.

01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:57.658
- Yes?
- It was too much for me, sir.

01:08:57.751 --> 01:09:00.420
I reckon that's why they sent me here.

01:09:00.671 --> 01:09:02.627
Camp coming up, sir.

01:09:16.310 --> 01:09:17.591
Slope...

01:09:17.688 --> 01:09:18.968
arms.

01:09:30.993 --> 01:09:32.535
Capt. Smith, sir.

01:09:32.618 --> 01:09:33.698
Hey.

01:09:44.756 --> 01:09:49.134
That's all we're short of,
that is. A crippled bloody hero.

01:10:04.693 --> 01:10:05.974
Well, now, sir.

01:10:06.695 --> 01:10:10.479
This is our communication
with the outside world.

01:10:14.077 --> 01:10:17.244
Field telephone to the police
station down the village.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:21.492
Now, then. Records.

01:10:25.464 --> 01:10:27.871
Hello? Constable O'Connor here.

01:10:27.966 --> 01:10:31.667
- Were you calling?
- No, no, Constable, just testing.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.554
Well, now, sir, where was I?

01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:39.885
Oh, aye. Records. Records. Transport.

01:10:40.854 --> 01:10:42.894
They're sending a...

01:10:43.065 --> 01:10:45.223
Well, I guess you'd
better see your room.

01:10:49.738 --> 01:10:51.778
Well, now, duty.

01:10:51.865 --> 01:10:54.403
Our duties are light.

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:55.987
Oh, good lad, Jimmy.

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:59.454
Jimmy will look after you
right nicely, Major Doryan.

01:11:05.879 --> 01:11:07.042
Tired?

01:11:08.382 --> 01:11:09.413
Yes.

01:11:09.716 --> 01:11:13.299
- That leg gives you gyp, don't it?
- Yes.

01:11:14.596 --> 01:11:17.087
Sent you here for a rest, did they?

01:11:17.933 --> 01:11:20.091
Yes, I think they did.

01:11:20.185 --> 01:11:24.397
Well, you'll get that, if naught else.
There's nothing to do here but walk.

01:11:24.982 --> 01:11:27.520
Oh, I'm sorry. I expect walking's out.

01:11:27.985 --> 01:11:30.820
No, I'm supposed to
walk. Five miles a day.

01:11:31.447 --> 01:11:34.447
Oh. Well, then. They've
sent you to the right place.

01:11:34.533 --> 01:11:36.526
There's some nice walks here.

01:11:36.618 --> 01:11:39.109
Our duties are light
enough, God knows.

01:11:39.955 --> 01:11:43.122
Our duties. It's more
like police work, isn't it?

01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:48.039
The publican's a
source of information.

01:11:49.047 --> 01:11:53.092
- An informer?
- Aye. Publican, name of Ryan.

01:11:53.177 --> 01:11:55.715
Well, he's nothing to inform, has he?

01:11:55.804 --> 01:11:59.636
But the police slip him a
fiver now and then, you know.

01:12:01.769 --> 01:12:03.429
Oh, he's all right.

01:12:03.854 --> 01:12:06.855
Big mouth, open hand,
empty pocket, you know?

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.977
Typical publican. But
he's all right, really.

01:12:10.736 --> 01:12:12.527
- Jimmy.
- Sir?

01:12:12.613 --> 01:12:14.855
- Are my bags on the lorry?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:19.700
I'll be straight off, if
it's all the same, sir.

01:12:19.787 --> 01:12:22.704
- I've given myself leave.
- Yes?

01:12:22.915 --> 01:12:24.575
Embarkation leave.

01:12:27.252 --> 01:12:28.497
France.

01:12:32.174 --> 01:12:34.665
Second battalion,
Southeast Lancashires.

01:12:35.803 --> 01:12:37.842
They're in the front line.

01:12:43.018 --> 01:12:45.426
Will you tell me
something, man to man?

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:48.722
What's it like, really?

01:12:48.816 --> 01:12:50.191
Front line?

01:12:58.242 --> 01:13:00.649
Aye. Well...

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:03.033
I'll find out soon enough.

01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:09.583
I'm a coward, you see.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:12.747
No, I always have been.

01:13:13.257 --> 01:13:14.881
From being a lad.

01:13:16.301 --> 01:13:18.211
I can't master it.

01:13:18.303 --> 01:13:21.340
Well, perhaps I've
never tried, really.

01:13:22.224 --> 01:13:25.474
But, I'd give my left arm to
have a bit of what you've got.

01:13:25.561 --> 01:13:27.103
I hate it.

01:13:27.187 --> 01:13:30.390
Just the bloody thought
of it gives me the shakes.

01:13:31.650 --> 01:13:34.817
That's my nightmare, as a
matter of fact, the shakes.

01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:36.611
I don't mind dying.

01:13:37.114 --> 01:13:40.779
Not if it's quick. Life's
not that much, is it?

01:13:42.744 --> 01:13:45.414
I wouldn't mind a gammy
leg like you've got.

01:13:45.497 --> 01:13:47.739
Though I don't suppose it's funny.

01:13:47.833 --> 01:13:49.113
But the shakes?

01:13:49.918 --> 01:13:51.496
Shellshock.

01:13:51.962 --> 01:13:56.458
Just shaking and shambling
like a epileptic baby.

01:13:58.135 --> 01:14:00.127
Nay, I'd rather be dead.

01:14:02.598 --> 01:14:04.555
I can see what's coming.

01:14:05.476 --> 01:14:07.717
I'm going to disgrace myself.

01:14:13.317 --> 01:14:15.440
You don't know what you'll do.

01:14:15.527 --> 01:14:18.730
No one does. You don't
know what you're doing.

01:14:24.328 --> 01:14:25.526
Really?

01:14:29.333 --> 01:14:31.954
I read what you did in the newspapers.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.161
That were no flash in the pan.

01:14:36.131 --> 01:14:38.669
You'd do the same again, I dare say.

01:14:39.718 --> 01:14:40.916
You'd be wrong.

01:14:43.486 --> 01:14:46.986
Well, you've done your bit.

01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:49.481
It's someone else's turn now, eh?

01:14:57.292 --> 01:15:00.578
Oh, dear. You look
about finished, sir.

01:15:01.588 --> 01:15:02.703
Here.

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.545
Good stuff, this. Cheap, too.

01:15:15.769 --> 01:15:17.643
That's the generator.

01:15:17.729 --> 01:15:21.394
The bloody thing stays on all
night, but you'll get used to that.

01:15:28.907 --> 01:15:30.485
This your house?

01:15:32.244 --> 01:15:34.651
- Yes.
- Well, I never.

01:15:36.456 --> 01:15:38.781
- Wife?
- Yes.

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:41.283
- May I?
- Please.

01:15:43.588 --> 01:15:44.703
Oh.

01:15:45.257 --> 01:15:46.667
Bonny woman.

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.920
Thank you.

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:53.756
- She'll be coming out, then?
- No, I don't think so.

01:15:59.437 --> 01:16:01.145
There's no local crumpet.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:04.562
It's married or virgin here, you know.

01:16:06.152 --> 01:16:09.771
And that priest down there has
got eyes in the back of his head.

01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:13.815
It gets bloody lonely here.

01:16:14.035 --> 01:16:15.993
Why not have her out?

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:21.907
Sorry.

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:25.830
Fools rush in, eh?

01:16:29.009 --> 01:16:31.963
You're probably better
on your own a bit.

01:16:32.053 --> 01:16:33.334
Excuse me.

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:37.847
I'll pop back to say goodbye.

01:17:11.051 --> 01:17:12.759
It's him.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.782
Peg leg.

01:18:24.624 --> 01:18:25.703
Sir?

01:18:25.792 --> 01:18:27.552
Excuse me, I didn't
realize you were serving.

01:18:27.586 --> 01:18:30.207
Well, I'm just minding.
What did you want?

01:18:31.172 --> 01:18:32.204
Whiskey.

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.350
Water?

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:54.144
Did you want water?

01:18:54.779 --> 01:18:55.978
Please.

01:18:59.993 --> 01:19:01.321
Thank you.

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:32.880
I must open the door.

01:23:40.899 --> 01:23:42.642
Sit, please.

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:57.203
- Is this where you live?
- What?

01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:58.998
Is this where you live?

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:06.290
- I live at the schoolhouse.
- Schoolhouse?

01:24:07.926 --> 01:24:11.377
- I'm married to the teacher.
- Oh.

01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:16.386
They're back.

01:24:20.605 --> 01:24:24.935
- I don't know your name.
- Shaughnessy, Rose Shaughnessy.

01:24:28.113 --> 01:24:31.861
Come away in, then.
One round on the house!

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:33.444
That's my dad.

01:24:34.953 --> 01:24:38.073
Your father is the publican?

01:24:38.164 --> 01:24:39.789
Yes, why not?

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:57.473
Now, I can't just say
you're very welcome, sir.

01:24:57.851 --> 01:25:00.852
Not in your official function.

01:25:00.937 --> 01:25:04.271
But in yourself, you're welcome.

01:25:04.357 --> 01:25:07.892
A brave man is a brave
man in any uniform.

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:12.779
English khaki, Irish
green, aye, or German gray.

01:25:16.203 --> 01:25:18.694
Aye, you've a large mind, sir.

01:25:18.997 --> 01:25:20.491
Put it there.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:26.292
You've met my daughter, then?

01:25:27.005 --> 01:25:28.120
Yes.

01:25:28.632 --> 01:25:31.502
All right, everyone, the
Major isn't a peep show.

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:33.135
Princess.

01:25:34.554 --> 01:25:38.006
Guess what your old dad's got
for you this time from the fair?

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:39.428
Guess.

01:25:39.518 --> 01:25:41.843
- I don't know, Father.
- Come and look.

01:25:48.527 --> 01:25:51.611
- Now, then.
- Father, you can't afford it.

01:25:51.696 --> 01:25:52.859
Oh, it's nothing.

01:25:52.948 --> 01:25:55.902
Just a little blood mare I
picked up at the fair, is all.

01:25:55.992 --> 01:25:58.946
- She's a Connemara.
- All right.

01:25:59.037 --> 01:26:03.366
You look as if you'd be a judge, sir.
Maybe you'll favor us with your opinion.

01:26:05.919 --> 01:26:07.034
Now.

01:26:10.674 --> 01:26:12.797
It's a fine horse, Mr. Ryan.

01:26:13.218 --> 01:26:15.791
- Are you away, then?
- Yes.

01:26:16.888 --> 01:26:19.510
Good day, Mr. Ryan, Mrs. Shaughnessy.

01:26:29.985 --> 01:26:31.230
Snob!

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:34.771
Of course he's a snob. Isn't that
what the English is famous for?

01:26:34.865 --> 01:26:36.193
Aye.

01:26:38.451 --> 01:26:39.994
On the house.

01:26:52.257 --> 01:26:53.420
Hello.

01:26:59.556 --> 01:27:01.963
Did you see our lord and master, then?

01:27:02.058 --> 01:27:06.222
- I did. Fine looking young man.
- Blather.

01:30:37.816 --> 01:30:40.651
- Will you meet me tomorrow?
- How?

01:30:45.782 --> 01:30:46.945
Where?

01:30:47.492 --> 01:30:49.983
- The tower.
- What tower?

01:30:50.412 --> 01:30:51.491
Ask.

01:30:52.330 --> 01:30:53.445
When?

01:30:53.832 --> 01:30:56.501
- 3:00?
- Yes.

01:31:51.097 --> 01:31:52.889
Whatever is this, darling?

01:31:53.391 --> 01:31:55.514
It must be the lilies.

01:32:07.072 --> 01:32:08.696
You're restless, Rosy.

01:32:09.241 --> 01:32:10.616
Yes, I am a bit.

01:32:19.626 --> 01:32:22.082
I think maybe I'll take
Princess out tomorrow.

01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:24.079
Aye, yes, do that.

01:32:24.673 --> 01:32:26.712
It'll please your father.

01:40:37.123 --> 01:40:38.997
How long will you be here?

01:40:41.586 --> 01:40:43.413
Till I ask to be sent back.

01:40:44.923 --> 01:40:46.382
To the front?

01:40:48.343 --> 01:40:49.718
To my unit.

01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:52.048
They're at the front.

01:40:55.016 --> 01:40:56.511
You'll not do that?

01:40:57.686 --> 01:40:59.559
No. Not now.

01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:02.731
Not now.

01:41:05.652 --> 01:41:07.443
Oh, darling.

01:41:08.113 --> 01:41:09.227
Darling.

01:41:20.083 --> 01:41:22.372
- Tomorrow?
- If I can.

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.163
Good night, darling.

01:41:27.257 --> 01:41:28.585
Good night.

01:42:09.779 --> 01:42:10.858
Rosy.

01:42:13.199 --> 01:42:15.108
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Rose.

01:42:17.078 --> 01:42:19.070
Where've you been, Rose?

01:42:19.163 --> 01:42:21.571
What's happened, Rosy?

01:42:21.666 --> 01:42:25.414
- Princess took a fall.
- Rose, no.

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.126
I'm fine. I'll just change.

01:42:33.094 --> 01:42:35.003
It was my own fault, really.

01:42:36.555 --> 01:42:39.260
I put her at a ditch
she wasn't up to, and...

01:42:39.392 --> 01:42:42.309
she lay on my leg and wouldn't get up.

01:42:42.395 --> 01:42:46.606
- Your leg, darling? Let me have a look.
- It's nothing at all.

01:42:47.942 --> 01:42:50.978
- If you're sure.
- I'm certain sure. It's nothing.

01:43:05.418 --> 01:43:07.743
But she wouldn't get up for anything.

01:43:10.798 --> 01:43:13.585
Do you know who came
to get me out of it?

01:43:14.969 --> 01:43:17.045
That new English officer.

01:43:19.306 --> 01:43:22.224
- Major Doryan?
- Aye, him.

01:43:24.603 --> 01:43:26.561
He came and got her up.

01:43:26.856 --> 01:43:29.263
Well, that was lucky.

01:43:42.455 --> 01:43:45.159
- What have you been doing?
- Waiting for you.

01:43:46.417 --> 01:43:49.038
You mustn't worry about
me, darling. I can ride.

01:43:49.128 --> 01:43:53.173
You can ride Champion, surely. But
the mare's not properly broke, Rose.

01:44:00.264 --> 01:44:03.514
Rose, she's not properly broke.

01:44:07.313 --> 01:44:11.311
Well, Major what's-his-name
did say he'd help me.

01:44:17.531 --> 01:44:19.773
- With the horse?
- Aye.

01:44:22.828 --> 01:44:25.236
But, I don't suppose he meant it.

01:44:27.875 --> 01:44:31.920
- He looks a man of his word to me.
- Does he, Charles?

01:44:33.339 --> 01:44:35.912
Seems like a fine
young fellow all around.

01:44:37.343 --> 01:44:40.427
You always think the
best of people, don't you?

01:44:40.846 --> 01:44:42.044
Why not?

01:44:46.769 --> 01:44:48.512
Well, we'll see.

01:44:48.604 --> 01:44:51.938
- Could you eat some supper?
- I could have a go at it, yes.

01:45:01.617 --> 01:45:02.862
Rose?

01:45:04.787 --> 01:45:05.866
Yes?

01:45:18.676 --> 01:45:21.511
You'd never be unfaithful
to me, would you?

01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:26.550
Charles.

01:45:29.562 --> 01:45:31.471
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have asked that.

01:45:31.564 --> 01:45:34.730
No, that's a rotten question
for a man to ask his wife.

01:50:55.484 --> 01:50:58.936
Sir, what's that there?

01:50:59.113 --> 01:51:01.022
What's that?

01:51:01.115 --> 01:51:03.688
Well, that's not the cuttlefish
that I told you to look for.

01:51:03.784 --> 01:51:06.820
That's for a start.
That is an insulator.

01:51:07.079 --> 01:51:09.202
Aye, an insulator, that is.

01:51:09.748 --> 01:51:11.824
Probably off a German battleship.

01:51:11.917 --> 01:51:15.167
I'm sure there's no German
battleships coming here, sir.

01:51:15.254 --> 01:51:18.623
- You don't know, there might be.
- No, Timmy's right.

01:51:18.716 --> 01:51:20.293
Now, tell me this.

01:51:20.384 --> 01:51:22.709
Why is there so much
stuff around Killins Bay?

01:51:22.803 --> 01:51:26.635
It's a tide... Tidal
eddy around the head.

01:51:26.724 --> 01:51:29.511
Tidal eddy. Very good, Tim. Good.

01:51:30.519 --> 01:51:32.891
All right, come on,
now. Go on looking.

01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:35.981
The tide's going
down. Go on, hurry up.

01:51:47.411 --> 01:51:49.736
Go on, Kathleen. Off with the others.

01:51:52.416 --> 01:51:55.168
You never know, you might
find a diamond tiara.

01:52:29.203 --> 01:52:31.077
Sir, sir.

01:52:31.997 --> 01:52:33.741
Aye, that's a cuttlefish.

01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:36.491
- Good lad.
- I'll try and find a bigger one.

01:52:36.585 --> 01:52:37.996
You do that, Tim.

01:55:43.939 --> 01:55:45.102
Come on.

01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:16.630
What is it, sir?

01:56:21.101 --> 01:56:23.972
No, it's nothing. Nothing.
'Tis all right, Kathy.

01:56:24.813 --> 01:56:26.012
Come on.

01:56:27.483 --> 01:56:29.725
Time we had lunch.
We're eating at Barrow.

01:56:29.818 --> 01:56:31.478
It's a long way to Barrow, sir.

01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:34.275
Step off, then. That's
where we're eating.

01:57:01.475 --> 01:57:03.349
Tide's coming in, sir.

01:57:07.356 --> 01:57:08.601
So it is.

01:59:36.213 --> 01:59:39.048
Hey, would you look at Michael?

01:59:41.719 --> 01:59:42.798
Michael.

01:59:47.516 --> 01:59:49.723
It's the Major.

01:59:59.069 --> 02:00:02.189
Hey, Tom, will you
have a look at this?

02:00:07.912 --> 02:00:09.951
He's getting worse, you know.

02:00:10.039 --> 02:00:14.582
Michael, let's have
a look at your V.C.

02:00:17.129 --> 02:00:19.418
- How many Germans did you kill, Michael?
- All right.

02:00:19.507 --> 02:00:22.757
All right, very entertaining.

02:00:25.888 --> 02:00:28.094
Michael, you're a perfect fool.

02:00:28.182 --> 02:00:32.014
You ask for trouble. Come on,
now, take the foolish things off.

02:00:34.188 --> 02:00:38.186
Michael, take them off, now. Come on.

02:00:42.446 --> 02:00:43.691
Michael!

02:00:55.167 --> 02:00:57.124
What's eating him?

02:00:57.211 --> 02:01:00.295
- What've you been doing?
- Don't know, Father.

02:01:00.756 --> 02:01:02.749
We've not done anything.

02:01:03.926 --> 02:01:06.678
Come on now, Michael.
What're you up to?

02:01:47.219 --> 02:01:48.417
Let go!

02:01:49.471 --> 02:01:52.009
Michael, let go, or I'll hit you.

02:01:56.145 --> 02:01:58.434
Michael, darling, let go.

02:02:28.093 --> 02:02:31.379
Major, darling, let me touch your V.C.

02:02:31.472 --> 02:02:35.470
You see, my husband hasn't got one.

02:03:19.937 --> 02:03:20.968
Well?

02:03:21.564 --> 02:03:22.643
Well.

02:03:22.773 --> 02:03:25.145
What was the meaning
of that pantomime?

02:03:26.068 --> 02:03:27.527
I don't know.

02:03:27.736 --> 02:03:30.654
- Where have you been?
- Riding...

02:03:31.532 --> 02:03:34.901
- with Major Doryan.
- You're bold as brass.

02:03:35.452 --> 02:03:39.284
You think that's a suitable
connection for a decent Irish wife?

02:03:39.373 --> 02:03:42.457
I think that is for my
husband to say, Father Hugh.

02:03:42.543 --> 02:03:44.417
- You've told him, have you?
- Yes.

02:03:44.503 --> 02:03:45.962
Yes, you would.

02:03:46.046 --> 02:03:48.419
Your husband would say anything
you wanted, pretty well...

02:03:48.507 --> 02:03:51.259
because he loves you
sorely, doesn't he?

02:03:54.763 --> 02:03:58.132
- Yes, he does.
- Have you nothing to say to me?

02:03:59.143 --> 02:04:01.812
- What should I have to say to you?
- You could say:

02:04:01.896 --> 02:04:04.256
"Father Hugh, there's nothing
between me and Major Doryan."

02:04:04.315 --> 02:04:06.806
- There isn't.
- Say it, then.

02:04:09.195 --> 02:04:12.564
There is nothing between
me and Major Doryan.

02:04:12.656 --> 02:04:14.281
Look at me, Rosy.

02:04:16.994 --> 02:04:19.200
Oh, child, what a face.

02:04:23.167 --> 02:04:25.705
- Rose, tell me now.
- What?

02:04:25.794 --> 02:04:28.167
You'll have to tell it in
confessional, you little fool.

02:04:28.255 --> 02:04:29.999
I don't have to come...

02:04:30.090 --> 02:04:32.546
- to the confessional.
- Child!

02:04:33.969 --> 02:04:35.345
Child?

02:04:41.268 --> 02:04:44.055
- Father.
- Hello, then.

02:04:44.146 --> 02:04:45.177
Rosy...

02:04:47.733 --> 02:04:49.690
was there something?

02:04:50.778 --> 02:04:53.067
No, I just...

02:04:53.155 --> 02:04:55.527
- Will you take the prayers, then?
- Aye.

02:05:04.625 --> 02:05:05.704
"Our Father..."

02:05:05.793 --> 02:05:08.663
"who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name."

02:05:08.754 --> 02:05:10.913
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done..."

02:05:11.006 --> 02:05:13.046
"on Earth as it is in heaven."

02:05:13.133 --> 02:05:17.380
"Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses..."

02:05:17.471 --> 02:05:20.721
"as we forgive those
who trespass against us."

02:05:20.808 --> 02:05:24.675
"And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil."

02:05:24.770 --> 02:05:28.305
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

02:05:28.399 --> 02:05:30.557
All right, children, off with you.

02:05:35.906 --> 02:05:38.278
Thank you, Father. Good day.

02:05:38.576 --> 02:05:40.449
Glad to help, Charles.

02:05:40.828 --> 02:05:43.615
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

02:05:43.706 --> 02:05:45.497
No, I don't think so.

02:05:45.875 --> 02:05:48.200
Well, I'll be off home, too, then.

02:06:05.895 --> 02:06:09.145
- You're late.
- I took them for a nature walk.

02:06:09.607 --> 02:06:11.350
Up Brandon?

02:06:11.442 --> 02:06:13.102
Along the shore.

02:06:15.279 --> 02:06:17.272
- For cuttlefish?
- Aye.

02:06:17.781 --> 02:06:19.276
For cuttlefish.

02:06:26.165 --> 02:06:29.368
If you'd come up Brandon,
we might have seen you.

02:06:29.460 --> 02:06:30.788
Why?

02:06:30.878 --> 02:06:33.451
- Did you go to Brandon?
- Aye.

02:06:33.797 --> 02:06:35.589
I got some heather.

02:06:36.175 --> 02:06:37.634
So you did.

02:06:40.804 --> 02:06:43.046
You haven't been to the beach, then?

02:06:43.933 --> 02:06:44.964
No.

02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:48.352
Oh, well.

02:06:49.480 --> 02:06:53.180
- It's nice up Brandon.
- Aye, it's grand.

02:09:10.788 --> 02:09:12.531
Is something the matter?

02:09:12.623 --> 02:09:14.580
I don't know, Rose. Is there?

02:09:16.168 --> 02:09:18.790
There's nothing the matter with me.

02:09:19.547 --> 02:09:21.670
Nothing's the matter, then.

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:38.270
And the jam, and the...

02:09:41.151 --> 02:09:42.895
The jam...

02:09:43.529 --> 02:09:45.438
and the soap.

02:09:45.531 --> 02:09:46.729
Maggie.

02:09:49.785 --> 02:09:51.577
That'll be 18 pence.

02:09:52.997 --> 02:09:55.535
Could it wait to the
end of the week, missus?

02:09:55.624 --> 02:09:58.246
Aye, to the end of the week.
Not to the crack of doom.

02:09:58.335 --> 02:09:59.913
Thank you.

02:10:04.216 --> 02:10:07.799
- What was it, then?
- I want a dishcloth, please.

02:10:08.137 --> 02:10:10.379
- I've none.
- Oh.

02:10:10.472 --> 02:10:13.473
Then I'll just take some
potatoes. Five pound.

02:10:13.893 --> 02:10:15.636
I've no potatoes, either.

02:10:18.647 --> 02:10:20.687
What's them, then?

02:10:20.774 --> 02:10:22.814
Aye, them.

02:10:22.902 --> 02:10:26.520
They're gone. I've no potatoes.

02:10:30.242 --> 02:10:31.653
Oh, I... I see.

02:10:38.083 --> 02:10:42.580
The way I see it, Mrs. Kenyon, there's
loose women and there's whores...

02:10:42.671 --> 02:10:46.123
and then there's
British soldiers' whores.

02:11:35.558 --> 02:11:38.808
- Coming up fast, Father.
- Aye.

02:11:38.894 --> 02:11:41.136
Will you look at those things?

02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.443
You'd think they was
announcing the coming of Christ.

02:12:07.381 --> 02:12:10.002
- Off you go!
- Right.

02:12:12.219 --> 02:12:14.212
Put her down!

02:12:15.264 --> 02:12:17.221
Slowly does it.

02:12:54.929 --> 02:12:58.380
All right, now! That's it. Come
on, Joe, there's a good lad.

02:12:59.767 --> 02:13:01.261
Come on, it's late.

02:13:02.186 --> 02:13:04.593
All right. Come on, Sean.

02:13:05.606 --> 02:13:08.097
Come on, Tom. You've
got to go to sleep.

02:13:09.777 --> 02:13:11.437
Go on. Good night!

02:13:35.427 --> 02:13:36.838
Hello, Tom.

02:13:38.347 --> 02:13:42.641
- You? What are you doing here?
- Come on, now, Tom.

02:13:43.269 --> 02:13:47.053
Phoenix Park, 1913.

02:13:51.777 --> 02:13:53.152
Tim O'Leary.

02:13:56.490 --> 02:13:58.282
Come on.

02:14:01.745 --> 02:14:03.323
Right, lads.

02:14:03.414 --> 02:14:06.083
Now, what do you usually
do at this time, Tom?

02:14:06.167 --> 02:14:07.625
- I go to bed.
- Right.

02:14:07.710 --> 02:14:09.453
This is Bernard. Go on up, lads.

02:14:09.545 --> 02:14:11.253
- Paddy.
- Paddy.

02:14:11.338 --> 02:14:12.453
Sean.

02:14:12.923 --> 02:14:15.414
Joseph, Peter...

02:14:16.510 --> 02:14:17.839
Mr. O'Keefe.

02:14:18.512 --> 02:14:20.968
- And you know Pat.
- Which room?

02:14:21.056 --> 02:14:22.467
At the back.

02:14:23.309 --> 02:14:26.144
But, Commandant,
sir, what's happening?

02:14:39.992 --> 02:14:41.486
Guns, is it?

02:14:41.577 --> 02:14:45.657
- That's right, Tom. German guns.
- German?

02:14:45.748 --> 02:14:49.164
Dynamite, grenades. All the
stuff the movement needs.

02:14:49.627 --> 02:14:52.331
We tried to launch the boat...

02:14:55.674 --> 02:14:58.878
- You must get to them somehow, then.
- We can't.

02:14:58.969 --> 02:15:03.678
But Sean here says there's a good chance
some of it will break away and come to us.

02:15:03.766 --> 02:15:05.509
- Float in?
- You're on to it.

02:15:05.601 --> 02:15:07.475
But, if it does, we won't know where.

02:15:07.561 --> 02:15:10.479
You can't see the nose on
your face out there now.

02:15:10.564 --> 02:15:12.356
So we'll wait till daylight.

02:15:12.441 --> 02:15:15.193
- Absolute madness.
- Will you shut up?

02:15:15.277 --> 02:15:16.440
Tom...

02:15:17.404 --> 02:15:20.192
if it's to be done in
daylight, it's to be done quick.

02:15:20.282 --> 02:15:22.571
So we must have some
fellows, say a dozen...

02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:26.527
good, strong fellows, and
that's where you come in.

02:15:30.042 --> 02:15:32.877
- What if it don't break away?
- Exactly.

02:15:33.045 --> 02:15:35.714
Then we'll wait one
hour and go without it.

02:15:35.798 --> 02:15:37.209
One hour, Tom...

02:15:37.299 --> 02:15:40.217
and 12 strong men.
That's all I'm asking.

02:15:40.511 --> 02:15:42.005
Can you do it?

02:15:42.596 --> 02:15:44.838
I could rout out a dozen, yes.

02:15:45.641 --> 02:15:47.883
- Do you want them now?
- Not at all.

02:15:48.727 --> 02:15:51.265
The later they know
we're here, the better.

02:15:51.355 --> 02:15:53.727
You let them lie till nearer morning.

02:15:53.816 --> 02:15:57.351
Can you find us something to
eat? It's gonna be a long night.

02:16:30.936 --> 02:16:33.427
Paddy, Tom.

02:16:34.565 --> 02:16:36.723
Take the Constable his breakfast.

02:16:47.786 --> 02:16:49.909
Jesus and Mary, what a night.

02:16:57.629 --> 02:17:01.129
Now, do not make one sound, Constable.

02:17:07.388 --> 02:17:09.429
Right. You.

02:17:09.517 --> 02:17:11.638
Fat guts, get the handcuffs.

02:17:12.686 --> 02:17:14.893
- Where are they?
- In the cupboard.

02:17:15.856 --> 02:17:17.054
Turn around.

02:17:28.326 --> 02:17:30.782
- I'm acting under duress.
- Shut up.

02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:32.907
Put them on him.

02:17:42.049 --> 02:17:43.876
Open your mouth, Constable.

02:17:59.275 --> 02:18:01.314
Is that a telephone line?

02:18:04.612 --> 02:18:05.858
Cut it.

02:18:33.225 --> 02:18:34.601
Oh, God.

02:18:35.311 --> 02:18:37.552
Why have you done this to me?

02:18:45.905 --> 02:18:47.731
Hello?

02:18:48.365 --> 02:18:49.776
This is Ryan.

02:18:51.075 --> 02:18:53.199
- Did you cut the wire?
- I did.

02:18:53.287 --> 02:18:55.161
You're doing well, Tom.

02:18:58.334 --> 02:19:00.825
- Where's the Constable?
- In the cellar.

02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:02.995
We can put a bullet
in him if you like.

02:19:03.088 --> 02:19:05.246
Constable... No!

02:19:05.341 --> 02:19:08.128
- Then get your men.
- Aye, Commandant.

02:19:09.261 --> 02:19:10.424
Right.

02:19:56.100 --> 02:19:57.559
They've gone!

02:19:59.645 --> 02:20:01.020
Busted loose!

02:21:17.848 --> 02:21:20.090
It's no good, Commandant!

02:21:20.184 --> 02:21:23.635
Why don't you get up
out of it while you can?

02:21:25.231 --> 02:21:26.310
Tim!

02:21:55.261 --> 02:21:59.128
- Hey, are you Tim O'Leary?
- Yes, son, yes.

02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.187
Father, what the hell
have you done this for?

02:22:12.278 --> 02:22:14.436
I didn't, they did!

02:22:14.530 --> 02:22:16.321
Well, do you know what you're doing?

02:22:16.407 --> 02:22:18.280
- Do you know what we've come for?
- Aye.

02:22:18.367 --> 02:22:20.692
- Have you got it?
- Well, look.

02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:26.617
- T'will be on the slabs.
- Where?

02:22:26.709 --> 02:22:28.084
The slabs!

02:23:49.625 --> 02:23:50.905
Tim!

02:25:02.156 --> 02:25:03.615
Come on.

02:25:12.708 --> 02:25:13.787
Yes, Kathy?

02:25:13.876 --> 02:25:16.367
- Aren't you coming to the beach, sir?
- The beach?

02:25:16.462 --> 02:25:18.170
Everyone's at the beach.

02:25:18.506 --> 02:25:22.290
- And why is everyone at the beach?
- I don't know, sir. I think it's a wreck.

02:25:22.384 --> 02:25:23.629
A wreck?

02:25:39.985 --> 02:25:43.354
Now, that's enough, Tom. You're
not as young as you used to be.

02:25:43.447 --> 02:25:44.692
Aye, come on!

02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:02.704
Oh, God.

02:26:13.310 --> 02:26:14.473
Pull!

02:26:52.016 --> 02:26:56.594
Right, up you get. You, too,
Father. Up. Keep it going.

02:26:58.147 --> 02:26:59.855
That's right, darling.

02:27:02.818 --> 02:27:04.147
That's right.

02:27:19.835 --> 02:27:21.495
Hey!

02:27:24.089 --> 02:27:25.370
Dynamite.

02:28:25.985 --> 02:28:28.191
What are you doing here?

02:28:28.904 --> 02:28:31.312
- Why shouldn't I be?
- Why?

02:28:35.786 --> 02:28:37.411
Thank you, ma'am.

02:28:39.039 --> 02:28:41.744
You know, we made speeches
about these people...

02:28:41.834 --> 02:28:43.328
but, by God...

02:28:59.351 --> 02:29:02.518
Thanks. You're a man!

02:29:20.915 --> 02:29:23.121
Come on, then!

02:29:25.753 --> 02:29:27.212
One!

02:29:27.296 --> 02:29:28.541
Two!

02:29:28.631 --> 02:29:30.339
Three!

02:31:05.519 --> 02:31:06.682
Sean?

02:31:07.813 --> 02:31:10.055
- I must take a chance.
- Aye.

02:31:10.149 --> 02:31:11.263
Good luck.

02:31:32.379 --> 02:31:34.538
Thank you. Get down, please.

02:31:34.632 --> 02:31:36.174
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

02:31:36.717 --> 02:31:38.377
You, here. You.

02:31:44.892 --> 02:31:48.343
No. No trouble now,
for your own sakes.

02:31:48.437 --> 02:31:49.552
O'Leary.

02:31:51.649 --> 02:31:53.937
That thing could kill
a lot of people, Major.

02:31:54.026 --> 02:31:55.105
Sir?

02:31:55.402 --> 02:31:56.434
No.

02:32:05.788 --> 02:32:07.412
Go on. Run, Tim!

02:32:08.916 --> 02:32:10.031
Run, Tim.

02:32:10.125 --> 02:32:11.750
Make it, Tim. Come on!

02:32:12.878 --> 02:32:14.254
- Run.
- O'Leary!

02:32:16.298 --> 02:32:17.378
Sir.

02:32:20.135 --> 02:32:22.258
- No!
- No!

02:32:24.515 --> 02:32:26.223
- Murderer!
- Don't shoot.

02:33:11.145 --> 02:33:13.137
What's wrong with the bastard?

02:33:30.664 --> 02:33:32.491
Boo!

02:33:35.669 --> 02:33:37.627
Shoot that slut, Shaughnessy.

02:33:38.923 --> 02:33:40.168
Careful, man.

02:33:42.384 --> 02:33:44.626
My God, they're a well-matched pair.

02:33:47.014 --> 02:33:48.556
All right, sir?

02:33:49.850 --> 02:33:51.843
- Got a cigarette?
- Yes, sir.

02:34:24.426 --> 02:34:26.549
Is there anything you want?

02:34:26.762 --> 02:34:28.091
Cigarette.

02:34:37.147 --> 02:34:40.065
- Anything else?
- Yes.

02:34:41.777 --> 02:34:44.398
Get out of my country.

02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:49.157
God bless you, Tim O'Leary!

02:35:06.427 --> 02:35:09.593
What are they going to
do with them boys, Father?

02:35:09.930 --> 02:35:11.638
They'll hang them, dear.

02:35:12.266 --> 02:35:13.760
They'll hang them.

02:35:24.778 --> 02:35:26.154
Bastard!

02:35:37.958 --> 02:35:39.038
Bastard!

02:36:01.857 --> 02:36:03.316
Get out!

02:36:19.291 --> 02:36:21.782
You're very kind to me today.

02:36:21.877 --> 02:36:23.040
Am I?

02:36:24.171 --> 02:36:26.330
Yes. Why?

02:36:27.883 --> 02:36:30.090
Am I not usually kind to you?

02:36:30.970 --> 02:36:33.840
Yes, you are. Always.

02:36:39.687 --> 02:36:42.890
Charles, do you know or not?

02:36:45.025 --> 02:36:46.270
I know.

02:36:51.031 --> 02:36:53.701
- Since when?
- The beginning.

02:36:57.037 --> 02:36:59.160
Don't lower your head, Rose.

02:37:06.797 --> 02:37:08.589
Why didn't you speak?

02:37:10.426 --> 02:37:11.885
I should have, shouldn't I?

02:37:14.638 --> 02:37:16.097
I don't know.

02:37:18.309 --> 02:37:22.258
It was easier not to, I suppose.
I didn't want to know, you know.

02:37:23.314 --> 02:37:27.525
And then I thought, if I let you
burn it out, the pair of you...

02:37:27.610 --> 02:37:29.851
you'd perhaps come back to me.

02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:16.165
Charles?

02:41:16.839 --> 02:41:17.870
Charles?

02:42:16.982 --> 02:42:20.980
Mr. Shaughnessy has been called
away, so I'm taking class.

02:42:27.159 --> 02:42:30.030
What's the first lesson today, Danny?

02:42:32.122 --> 02:42:35.408
- Danny?
- My father says not to speak to you, miss.

02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:19.751
- It's right then, he's not here?
- No.

02:43:20.379 --> 02:43:22.253
I don't know where he is.

02:43:22.339 --> 02:43:24.747
- You mean he's gone off?
- Yes.

02:43:24.842 --> 02:43:25.957
When?

02:43:26.886 --> 02:43:28.261
Last night.

02:43:30.347 --> 02:43:32.139
You had a row?

02:43:32.224 --> 02:43:33.849
I wasn't here.

02:43:33.934 --> 02:43:35.428
Where were you?

02:43:36.812 --> 02:43:38.769
Oh, I see.

02:43:40.107 --> 02:43:43.143
There's nothing I can do tonight,
I'll find him in the morning.

02:43:43.235 --> 02:43:46.355
- If he turns up, you'll tell me.
- Father?

02:43:48.115 --> 02:43:50.404
You'd better take his clothes.

02:43:52.286 --> 02:43:54.279
His clothes?

02:44:03.172 --> 02:44:05.414
He was in bed?

02:44:05.591 --> 02:44:07.465
Yes.

02:44:07.551 --> 02:44:10.671
You left his bed and went to...

02:44:16.477 --> 02:44:18.185
Rose.

02:44:21.106 --> 02:44:23.265
Oh, Rose.

02:44:59.144 --> 02:45:01.054
Come on, this isn't a picnic.

02:45:01.146 --> 02:45:03.720
All right, Corp, but
there's nothing here.

02:45:31.177 --> 02:45:33.003
He's got something there, sir.

02:45:33.095 --> 02:45:34.293
Padre.

02:45:44.565 --> 02:45:46.474
Good morning, padre.

02:45:46.567 --> 02:45:49.437
I'm sorry, but what is
it you have there, please?

02:45:53.490 --> 02:45:55.234
A man's clothes.

02:45:56.660 --> 02:45:57.905
I see.

02:45:58.204 --> 02:46:00.991
- And where are you taking them, Father?
- To the man.

02:46:01.081 --> 02:46:03.121
Come on, padre. I don't
suppose you mean any harm...

02:46:03.209 --> 02:46:06.328
but after the other day, we've
got to be careful. What man?

02:46:06.420 --> 02:46:10.632
A man whose wife went off two
nights back with her fancy fellow.

02:46:11.467 --> 02:46:14.088
And a man I've been looking
for since dawn today.

02:46:14.178 --> 02:46:16.550
- A man...
Excuse me, sir.

02:46:16.639 --> 02:46:21.217
A man who must be half out of his mind
to have gone off as he did, barefoot.

02:46:22.770 --> 02:46:26.103
That's right. Charles Shaughnessy.

02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:42.956
I think we're finished here, sir.

02:46:44.291 --> 02:46:45.951
Very well.

02:47:40.222 --> 02:47:43.009
- Hello, Charles.
- Hello, Father.

02:47:46.187 --> 02:47:48.475
I've brought your clothes.

02:47:48.564 --> 02:47:52.015
Thanks, Father. I was
wondering how I should get home.

02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:55.397
- And something to drink.
- Thanks.

02:48:01.577 --> 02:48:04.246
- Yourself?
- Aye, I will.

02:48:09.585 --> 02:48:12.669
- You seem all right, man.
- Aye, more or less.

02:48:12.755 --> 02:48:14.747
Well, I'll get dressed now.

02:48:48.916 --> 02:48:50.790
Michael.

02:48:52.586 --> 02:48:55.872
He'll be after catching
a few flounders.

02:48:58.676 --> 02:49:01.427
So, what have you been
doing down here, Charles?

02:49:01.512 --> 02:49:04.085
Oh, thinking.

02:49:04.557 --> 02:49:06.882
About Rosy?

02:49:07.184 --> 02:49:09.426
About myself, mostly.

02:49:10.187 --> 02:49:14.102
Thanks for the clothes. You're
a man in a million, Father Hugh.

02:50:00.029 --> 02:50:02.187
The children haven't come today, then?

02:50:02.281 --> 02:50:03.396
No.

02:50:05.159 --> 02:50:08.658
Rose, I have something
to say to you. Come in.

02:50:17.296 --> 02:50:19.123
Sit down, will you?

02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:27.882
Rose, I thought I could stand by and
let you two burn it out, like I said.

02:50:27.973 --> 02:50:30.215
But I find I can't.

02:50:31.644 --> 02:50:36.140
I'm not sure I ought to have
tried, but anyway, I can't.

02:50:37.733 --> 02:50:40.058
So I'm going to leave you.

02:50:44.573 --> 02:50:47.029
- Very well.
- Sit still a minute, Rose.

02:50:48.244 --> 02:50:50.402
What about you? You and him?

02:50:52.915 --> 02:50:56.118
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

02:50:57.294 --> 02:50:58.670
It's over.

02:51:00.548 --> 02:51:03.798
Was that because I
went and stayed away?

02:51:03.884 --> 02:51:04.915
No.

02:51:06.679 --> 02:51:08.054
It's over.

02:51:09.807 --> 02:51:12.642
- Have you told him?
- No.

02:51:12.726 --> 02:51:15.348
He doesn't know, then?

02:51:15.437 --> 02:51:17.430
Yes, he knows.

02:51:17.523 --> 02:51:18.982
How?

02:51:19.775 --> 02:51:21.056
He must.

02:51:23.571 --> 02:51:25.978
You're as close as that, are you?

02:51:28.492 --> 02:51:30.449
We were, yes.

02:51:51.974 --> 02:51:53.967
Rose, you must tell me the truth.

02:51:54.059 --> 02:51:56.729
Do you think you're
ever gonna forget him?

02:51:56.812 --> 02:51:59.220
Of course not.

02:51:59.315 --> 02:52:01.640
He'd be like a ghost about the place.

02:52:02.276 --> 02:52:04.399
Rose, am I right?

02:52:06.488 --> 02:52:08.528
Yes, you're right.

02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:11.574
It's busted, Charles.

02:52:12.786 --> 02:52:14.197
I busted it.

02:52:17.666 --> 02:52:20.916
Now, have you thought what to do?

02:52:21.003 --> 02:52:23.411
- No.
- Well, I have.

02:52:24.465 --> 02:52:27.419
I don't think either of us can
stay in this village any longer.

02:52:27.510 --> 02:52:28.541
No.

02:52:28.636 --> 02:52:32.384
It's time I moved on anyway. And
you were never worse suited here.

02:52:33.599 --> 02:52:37.050
I've reckoned up, I've
got about 200 pounds.

02:52:38.938 --> 02:52:42.805
Take all this, without the
gramophone, fetch another 50.

02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:45.058
We'll split it down the middle.

02:52:45.152 --> 02:52:46.860
I can't do it.

02:52:49.198 --> 02:52:50.573
We're not enemies, Rose.

02:52:51.867 --> 02:52:55.236
Stop that! There's to be none of that.

02:53:06.882 --> 02:53:08.674
But why must it be Rosy?

02:53:08.759 --> 02:53:11.546
Because she was
fornicating with the fellow.

02:53:14.431 --> 02:53:16.720
So, you're back, are you?

02:53:16.809 --> 02:53:18.848
What is this? What do you want?

02:53:19.103 --> 02:53:21.594
- Not you.
- Well, then get out.

02:53:22.648 --> 02:53:25.768
- Go on, get out.
- Shut up, Shaughnessy.

02:53:28.946 --> 02:53:30.570
We're waiting for her.

02:53:32.283 --> 02:53:33.611
You.

02:53:33.868 --> 02:53:37.817
You've been tried and found
guilty. You're the informer.

02:53:39.415 --> 02:53:42.998
- What?
- Busting at the seams with innocence.

02:53:43.127 --> 02:53:46.044
Joe, for God's sake, don't
hurt her, Joe. Don't hurt her.

02:53:46.130 --> 02:53:49.795
If she was a man, Mr.
Ryan, she'd be shot.

02:53:51.218 --> 02:53:54.718
- What is this?
- Listen, numbskull.

02:53:55.139 --> 02:53:57.808
Someone that morning
went up to the camp...

02:53:57.892 --> 02:53:59.931
and betrayed Tim O'Leary.

02:54:00.394 --> 02:54:03.597
Now, who lives near
enough? Who had time enough?

02:54:03.939 --> 02:54:06.430
Who would? Who did?

02:54:07.067 --> 02:54:09.226
That bitch you call your wife.

02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:10.648
String her up!

02:54:14.825 --> 02:54:17.945
But anyone could have, if anyone
did. The whole village was abroad.

02:54:18.037 --> 02:54:20.195
No. The village was down on the beach.

02:54:20.289 --> 02:54:21.867
- Except you.
- You came late.

02:54:21.957 --> 02:54:25.457
- We came together. We spoke to no one.
- You'd say that, of course.

02:54:25.544 --> 02:54:26.873
Young Kathy was with us.

02:54:26.962 --> 02:54:29.667
Young Kathy would say black
was white if you told her.

02:54:29.757 --> 02:54:32.508
Then anyone, anyone at all could've
gone into the police station...

02:54:32.593 --> 02:54:35.510
- and used the telephone.
- That's where you're wrong.

02:54:35.596 --> 02:54:38.550
They couldn't. Could they, Tom?

02:54:38.641 --> 02:54:40.598
- No.
- Why not?

02:54:40.684 --> 02:54:44.385
Because Tom went in there
himself and cut the wire.

02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:46.638
Didn't you, Tom?

02:54:48.901 --> 02:54:51.855
Well, you went in there
yourself, didn't you?

02:54:53.072 --> 02:54:56.441
- Yes.
- And you cut the wire, didn't you?

02:55:01.080 --> 02:55:02.455
Yes.

02:55:11.006 --> 02:55:14.458
Well, what do you say now?

02:55:16.428 --> 02:55:18.053
Nothing.

02:55:18.264 --> 02:55:19.758
Take her out.

02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:23.344
No, you're taking her nowhere.

02:55:24.103 --> 02:55:25.977
Stop it!

02:55:33.445 --> 02:55:35.105
- Informer.
- There she is!

02:55:48.627 --> 02:55:49.956
Hold him.

02:56:05.436 --> 02:56:07.060
Take him by the hands.

02:56:18.741 --> 02:56:21.658
Quiet! Get back!

02:56:23.412 --> 02:56:25.155
Get back!

02:56:30.336 --> 02:56:31.534
Do it.

02:57:16.298 --> 02:57:17.579
Princess...

02:57:31.939 --> 02:57:33.219
What is it?

02:57:45.202 --> 02:57:46.994
There she is.

02:58:49.683 --> 02:58:53.218
Look here, Father Hugh, the
stripping of her was an accident.

02:58:53.312 --> 02:58:54.510
Steady, Joe.

02:58:54.605 --> 02:58:57.013
You're taking advantage
of your cloth, Father Hugh.

02:58:57.107 --> 02:58:59.943
- That's what it's for.
- Come on, Joe.

02:59:00.986 --> 02:59:03.738
It's not right. A
priest is only a man.

03:00:00.546 --> 03:00:01.744
Go on.

03:00:04.633 --> 03:00:06.626
Go on, Michael, get off.

03:00:11.974 --> 03:00:13.801
Get off out of it!

03:02:01.876 --> 03:02:03.074
Hello.

03:02:36.911 --> 03:02:38.191
Keep it.

03:03:31.006 --> 03:03:32.501
What?

03:03:36.095 --> 03:03:38.004
They really thought...

03:03:39.306 --> 03:03:43.304
I was the one who betrayed that man.

03:03:43.936 --> 03:03:45.430
Rose...

03:03:45.688 --> 03:03:49.222
I don't for one moment suppose
that anyone betrayed him.

03:03:50.359 --> 03:03:52.850
Why should they? They just...

03:03:52.945 --> 03:03:56.812
They just wanted it so, that's all.
And they wanted it to be you, too.

03:03:56.907 --> 03:03:58.864
For other reasons.

03:03:58.951 --> 03:04:02.035
Truth was told, they envy
you. They always have.

03:04:02.913 --> 03:04:06.199
They've always had a rare,
old contempt for me, too.

03:04:07.334 --> 03:04:10.538
I tell you, I'm not for letting any
of that lot know we've busted up.

03:04:10.629 --> 03:04:13.714
We'll just keep up a front
until I'm well and out of it.

03:04:15.259 --> 03:04:16.753
What?

03:04:17.636 --> 03:04:19.676
I don't know.

03:04:19.763 --> 03:04:21.922
It just seemed funny, that's all.

03:07:10.392 --> 03:07:13.726
Michael, give that to me.

03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:21.851
All right, keep it.

03:07:24.281 --> 03:07:26.357
I thought we were friends.

03:07:35.251 --> 03:07:38.121
That one, too. Give it to me.

03:07:38.212 --> 03:07:40.964
No! Look.

03:08:05.739 --> 03:08:08.990
For Christ's sake, man,
I'm not going to hurt you.

03:10:05.901 --> 03:10:09.021
- It'll be the soldiers.
- Soldiers?

03:10:09.280 --> 03:10:10.655
Aye.

03:10:10.739 --> 03:10:14.903
The beach was fairly littered with
stuff. They'll be destroying it.

03:10:15.995 --> 03:10:17.240
Oh, yes.

03:10:58.787 --> 03:11:00.614
Come on, lads, pick them up.

03:11:00.706 --> 03:11:03.707
What about my blisters, Corporal?

03:11:03.792 --> 03:11:06.996
- Well, they're not mourning long.
- No.

03:11:08.839 --> 03:11:11.793
Does she think he killed
himself deliberate?

03:11:11.884 --> 03:11:13.164
She says...

03:11:15.012 --> 03:11:17.764
I think he was a man who
suffered, Father Hugh.

03:11:19.141 --> 03:11:21.715
You love her sorely,
don't you, Charles?

03:11:21.810 --> 03:11:22.890
Yes.

03:11:29.109 --> 03:11:31.861
- Ready, then?
- Yes.

03:11:41.163 --> 03:11:44.828
It's not all your doing, Rosy.
I should not have married you.

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:46.080
No.

03:11:48.254 --> 03:11:50.460
You can tell Father Hugh that
we're parting if you like.

03:11:50.548 --> 03:11:51.627
No.

03:12:22.663 --> 03:12:24.620
- Rosy.
- Father.

03:12:25.791 --> 03:12:28.709
It'll be a fair day for
the journey, yet, I think.

03:12:29.086 --> 03:12:31.292
I hope so, yes.

03:12:34.091 --> 03:12:36.416
Well, now, how shall we manage?

03:12:36.677 --> 03:12:37.840
Margaret.

03:12:37.928 --> 03:12:40.217
Come here, Margaret. Come here.

03:13:09.001 --> 03:13:11.041
Kathy, come in.

03:13:18.219 --> 03:13:21.670
Kathy, will I take the belt to you?

03:13:51.210 --> 03:13:53.037
Take my arm.

03:14:15.651 --> 03:14:17.442
A rousing sendoff.

03:14:18.195 --> 03:14:20.686
We'll be out of it in five minutes.

03:14:41.468 --> 03:14:42.548
Dad.

03:14:53.939 --> 03:14:56.181
Goodbye, Dad.

03:14:57.151 --> 03:14:58.811
Bye, princess.

03:15:03.532 --> 03:15:05.655
I'm all right.

03:15:06.535 --> 03:15:09.738
- Are you, darling?
- Aye.

03:15:09.997 --> 03:15:13.864
I'm looking forward
to Dublin and that.

03:15:14.668 --> 03:15:16.578
Really.

03:15:16.670 --> 03:15:19.244
That's your mother speaking.

03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:22.839
- Do you remember your mother, Rose?
- A bit.

03:15:24.678 --> 03:15:26.885
Do you, like...

03:15:26.972 --> 03:15:29.724
- remember the rows?
- Aye.

03:15:29.808 --> 03:15:33.343
- I never raised a fist to her, Rose.
- I know that, Dad.

03:15:35.523 --> 03:15:38.559
You wouldn't hurt a fly
if you could help it.

03:15:45.491 --> 03:15:48.527
- I'll write to you.
- And I'll write to you.

03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:52.240
- Well, maybe.
- No. I swear to God, Rose.

03:15:52.331 --> 03:15:55.782
- I will write every...
Every... All right, Dad.

03:15:56.961 --> 03:15:58.953
We'll both write regular.

03:16:01.674 --> 03:16:02.705
Bye-bye.

03:16:02.800 --> 03:16:06.169
Well, wait a minute, I must
say goodbye to your husband.

03:16:10.057 --> 03:16:12.014
You know, Rose...

03:16:12.101 --> 03:16:16.181
when you married him, I thought
you could have done a lot better.

03:16:19.191 --> 03:16:21.729
Now I'm not so sure
they come much better.

03:16:23.279 --> 03:16:25.567
Would you tell him that?

03:16:25.656 --> 03:16:28.527
It's not a thing one fellow
can easily say to another.

03:16:32.288 --> 03:16:33.616
Shaughnessy.

03:16:35.040 --> 03:16:36.998
Mike.

03:16:40.171 --> 03:16:41.748
Goodbye, Shaughnessy.

03:16:43.090 --> 03:16:45.083
Goodbye, Mr. Ryan.

03:16:45.176 --> 03:16:47.845
Are you all right for money,
you two? I have a bit by me.

03:16:47.928 --> 03:16:51.712
We're fine for money,
Dad. Thanks. Goodbye.

03:17:02.735 --> 03:17:04.063
Good luck.

03:17:35.643 --> 03:17:38.893
- Get out and don't come back!
- Get out!

03:17:40.856 --> 03:17:41.935
Informer.

03:18:27.152 --> 03:18:29.110
Bus will be here in a minute.

03:18:35.828 --> 03:18:39.078
It's brightened for you, like I said.

03:18:39.165 --> 03:18:40.410
Aye.

03:18:41.250 --> 03:18:43.207
Grand day for a journey.

03:18:45.754 --> 03:18:47.379
Sign of good luck.

03:19:22.917 --> 03:19:24.115
Thanks.

03:19:26.253 --> 03:19:27.747
Bus is coming.

03:19:34.470 --> 03:19:37.803
You won't have an address
in Dublin yet, I suppose.

03:19:38.474 --> 03:19:39.802
No, Father, we...

03:19:39.892 --> 03:19:42.976
I've wrote down here the name
and address of a decent woman...

03:19:43.062 --> 03:19:46.644
who'll ask six shillings a week
for a dry room and a clean bed.

03:19:48.901 --> 03:19:50.940
Six shillings, the pair of you.

03:19:52.404 --> 03:19:55.358
You'll not do better
than that, not in Dublin.

03:19:56.158 --> 03:19:58.365
No, I don't suppose so.

03:20:00.496 --> 03:20:02.120
Thanks, Father.

03:20:22.184 --> 03:20:23.762
Bye, Michael.

03:20:31.151 --> 03:20:34.437
I have a parting gift
for you here, Rose.

03:20:34.530 --> 03:20:37.697
It's supposed to be a fragment
of St. Patrick's staff.

03:20:38.242 --> 03:20:40.650
I don't suppose it is, though.

03:20:43.914 --> 03:20:45.871
God bless you, child.

03:20:47.042 --> 03:20:49.878
Come on, now. Come on, get on up.

03:20:50.838 --> 03:20:52.712
I'll help you load up.

03:21:06.729 --> 03:21:10.394
Thanks, Father. Thanks
for a great many things.

03:21:10.482 --> 03:21:11.858
Charles?

03:21:11.942 --> 03:21:15.607
I think you have it in your mind
that you and Rosy ought to part.

03:21:16.614 --> 03:21:18.820
Yes, I thought as much.

03:21:18.908 --> 03:21:21.909
Well, maybe you're right,
maybe you ought, but I doubt it.

03:21:21.994 --> 03:21:25.445
And that's my parting
gift to you. That doubt.

03:21:29.960 --> 03:21:31.336
God bless.

03:21:44.308 --> 03:21:45.802
I don't know.

03:21:48.103 --> 03:21:51.437
I don't know at all. Come on, Michael.
