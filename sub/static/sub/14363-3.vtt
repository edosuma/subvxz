00:15.245 --> 00:16.745
Can we chat for a minute?

Uh, sure.

[TV mutes]

00:37.534 --> 00:40.369
Mom, dad, I've decided
I'd like to be popular.

00:41.972 --> 00:43.505
Okay.

00:43.506 --> 00:45.574
Not sure that's really couch-worthy.

00:45.575 --> 00:47.807
I've noticed lately that
all of the other boys

00:47.808 --> 00:49.215
seem to get picked up together.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.600
I don't know where they're going,

00:50.601 --> 00:52.735
but they laugh and slap
each other on the back

00:52.736 --> 00:55.711
and treat each other with a
lot of camaraderie and bonhomie.

00:56.936 --> 00:58.621
Well...

00:58.622 --> 01:01.824
Bonhomie does not grow on trees.

01:01.825 --> 01:03.092
It looks very enjoyable.

01:03.093 --> 01:04.560
And I'm thinking I
might want to participate

01:04.561 --> 01:05.761
in that kind of thing.

01:05.762 --> 01:07.429
I know I'm not very
good at the social stuff,

01:07.430 --> 01:10.099
so I would appreciate
any tips you could offer.

01:11.301 --> 01:12.768
Okay.

01:12.769 --> 01:14.870
I know you love your books,

01:14.871 --> 01:18.007
but maybe you should put
them down once in a while

01:18.008 --> 01:19.308
and talk to people...

01:19.309 --> 01:21.977
you know, like at lunch or parties

01:21.978 --> 01:23.512
or at that class we send you to

01:23.513 --> 01:26.081
to teach you how to... Talk to people.

01:26.082 --> 01:27.416
The thing is,

01:27.417 --> 01:29.718
I've always enjoyed
reading by myself at lunch,

01:29.719 --> 01:33.355
but lately, when I do
it, it feels... Lonely.

01:33.356 --> 01:36.025
Aw, Brick. I'm sorry.

But here's the thing...
it's never too late.

You know, maybe if you tried
just a little small talk with...

01:55.178 --> 01:58.047
Ah! Dude, the union was crazy.

02:01.384 --> 02:02.718
I got to pick a major."

to worry about this now?</i>

02:07.057 --> 02:08.257
[Chuckling] Yeah.

We don't have to declare
a major till Friday.

02:10.026 --> 02:11.260
Wait.

<i>This Friday?</i>

02:12.495 --> 02:14.296
Aw, crap.

02:14.297 --> 02:15.831
Guess we better stop slacking off.

02:15.832 --> 02:17.166
All right. [Snaps fingers]

02:17.167 --> 02:18.767
What do you say we grab a quick nap,

02:18.768 --> 02:20.602
then slap six majors up on a dartboard

02:20.603 --> 02:21.937
and pick whatever we hit?

02:21.938 --> 02:23.806
Boob doctor will be the bull's-eye.

02:23.807 --> 02:25.774
Nah, I already picked
my major... engineering.

02:25.775 --> 02:27.443
What? Since when?

02:27.444 --> 02:28.877
Since freshman year.

02:28.878 --> 02:31.313
No, actually, I've wanted to
be an engineer since I was 10.

02:31.314 --> 02:33.048
Got my next three years all laid out.

02:33.049 --> 02:35.417

all B's, and now this?

02:41.524 --> 02:42.725
When does it end?!

02:42.726 --> 02:44.159
Wait. Why'd you come to college?

02:44.160 --> 02:45.861
Because I was done with high school.

02:45.862 --> 02:46.929
That's where you go.

02:46.930 --> 02:48.664
So now I've got till the end of the week

02:48.665 --> 02:50.899
to decide what I'm doing
with the rest of my life?

02:50.900 --> 02:52.334
[Muffled] Well, I suppose

02:52.335 --> 02:54.236
there's some magic book
with all the majors in it

02:54.237 --> 02:56.293
that tells me what I'm supposed to be.

02:56.294 --> 02:58.109
There is.

<i>- It's Buddhist studies.
- What did you do?</i>

04:01.084 --> 04:04.201
Look at an alphabetical list
of majors and stop at "B"?

What? It's perfect for me.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.125
There's no class on Fridays,
doesn't meet before 11:00,

04:08.126 --> 04:09.667
half the time, we meet under a tree...

04:09.668 --> 04:11.427
'cause I guess Buddha was into that.

04:11.428 --> 04:13.244
And Buddhism is about rebirth,

04:13.245 --> 04:15.491
so I'll learn how my
coolness will live on forever.

04:15.492 --> 04:16.732
In your face, death!

04:16.733 --> 04:18.548
Axl, what kind of a job do
you think you're gonna get

04:18.548 --> 04:19.940
as a Buddhist-studies major?

04:19.940 --> 04:21.851
Enh. Cross that bridge when I get to it.

04:21.853 --> 04:23.676
You can't cross what you're living under.

04:23.677 --> 04:25.532
You're not majoring in Buddhism.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.996
Well, then, what am I supposed to do?

04:26.997 --> 04:28.597
You guys don't even have
a business I can take over.

04:28.598 --> 04:30.236

04:30.237 --> 04:32.169
we don't want to tell you what to do.

This is about you. You can
be anything you want to be.

But just make sure you
can make a decent salary.

Oh, and don't pick something
that's gonna get phased out,

you're going through, Axl.

thing trying to pick a college.

I was hoping you could give me tips

05:10.951 --> 05:12.047
on how to be popular, too.

05:12.048 --> 05:13.976
Mm. Well, it's gonna be tough,

05:13.977 --> 05:16.799
'cause you don't start off with
the basic awesomeness I have.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.151
I see where you're coming from.

05:18.152 --> 05:20.447
But I have grown quite fond
of you over the years, Brick,

05:20.448 --> 05:22.087
so I'm gonna give you some advice.

band kids, the A.V. club,

05:39.034 --> 05:41.373
maybe some girl who was
kicked in the head by a donkey

05:41.374 --> 05:42.386
and talks slow.

05:42.387 --> 05:44.361
There is a kid who just came
to school with a neck brace.

05:44.362 --> 05:46.678
Ooh! Mnh-mnh. That's temporary.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.234
It will come off, and he could be cool.

05:48.235 --> 05:49.331
Don't waste your time.

- Brick!

06:02.537 --> 06:04.351
I was just organizing
everything under my bed,

06:04.352 --> 06:05.584

albums, glittery pinecones.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.462
It's a real mess down there.

06:08.463 --> 06:09.789
Everything is covered with dust bunnies.

[Gasps] Did you need something?

06:13.399 --> 06:14.910
I just wondered if you can talk...

06:14.911 --> 06:17.393
- Talk? [Gasps] We should have coffee.
- Why?

06:17.394 --> 06:18.422
Because that's what
people do when they talk.

06:18.423 --> 06:20.436
<i>They have coffee. I love coffee.</i>

06:20.437 --> 06:21.808
I mean, I already had coffee,

06:21.809 --> 06:23.155
but what's a conversation without coffee?

06:23.156 --> 06:24.551
Of course, you're too young for coffee.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.619
You can have cocoa.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.306
So I'll just go get us
some coffee and cocoa,

06:27.307 --> 06:28.744
'cause I can have coffee and you can't.

06:28.745 --> 06:30.271
Uh, n-no, thank you.

06:30.272 --> 06:33.463
Ohhh. But then we can hold our
mugs of coffee and sip our coffee.

06:33.464 --> 06:36.747
You can have cocoa, and we
can sit here by the window...

06:36.748 --> 06:38.100
Or on the bed...

06:38.101 --> 06:39.436
Or on the chair.

I tried to talk to a girl
with a really high forehead.

06:48.894 --> 06:50.325
It did not go great.

06:50.326 --> 06:53.057
Mm. Well, you just got to keep trying.

06:53.058 --> 06:54.624
And before you know it, y...

Brick, you're not even looking at me.

06:57.031 --> 06:58.379
Why are you looking at behind me?

06:58.380 --> 06:59.731
I was just thinking...

06:59.732 --> 07:01.474
I've always liked that cow painting.

07:03.380 --> 07:06.536
See, this is what I'm talking about.

07:06.537 --> 07:10.243
If you want to make friends,
you got to make eye contact.

07:10.244 --> 07:12.304
You have to engage people.

07:12.305 --> 07:13.958
Think of it like you're on a talk show.

07:13.959 --> 07:15.334
You know, actors go on there,

07:15.335 --> 07:17.620
and they're always selling themselves

07:17.621 --> 07:19.942
and interacting and being funny.

You know what? Let's... let's practice.

So, Brick, what's this I hear
about a girl with a high forehead?

07:40.231 --> 07:42.490
She sits next to me in wood shop.

07:42.491 --> 07:44.019
Oh. Wood shop?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.803
I'll bet there's a good story there.

07:45.804 --> 07:48.460
Well, we're making spice racks,

07:48.461 --> 07:51.840
and I asked her to pass me a sheet
of 40-grit ultra-coarse sandpaper.

07:51.841 --> 07:53.859
I thought that would open
up a dialogue between us,

07:53.860 --> 07:54.959
but I was wrong.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.095
Well, look who's here.
It's your dad... Mike Heck.

07:58.096 --> 07:59.663

08:16.924 --> 08:18.946
Look... I even brought a clip.

08:18.947 --> 08:20.931
<i>- [Sports announcer talking]
- [Door opens]</i>

08:20.932 --> 08:24.262
Well, look who's here.
It's Axl and the Ax-Men.

08:24.263 --> 08:25.862
They're always charming.

08:25.863 --> 08:28.297
We're doing a talk show to help Brick.

08:28.298 --> 08:29.406
Why don't you guys have a seat?

08:29.407 --> 08:31.283
Um, 'cause we're not lame. [Chuckles]

08:31.284 --> 08:32.501
I think we should do it.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.182
Could be good exposure for the band.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.429
So, what's going on with you, Axl?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.332
Well, picked a new major.

08:39.333 --> 08:43.149
Great. I think our audience would be
very interested in hearing about that.

08:43.150 --> 08:45.509
Yep, I went with engineering 'cause, uh,

08:45.510 --> 08:47.429
hutch is doing it, so I
figured we could do it together.

08:47.430 --> 08:50.426
Plus, I like trains, so...

08:50.427 --> 08:52.796
It's got nothing to do with trains.

08:52.797 --> 08:54.221
Uh, I think it does.

08:54.222 --> 08:55.773
Uh, I know it doesn't.

08:55.774 --> 08:58.709
Engineers are the guys that
build bridges and buildings.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.742
<i>Oh, my God! That's an engineer?</i>

09:00.743 --> 09:02.503
Why don't they just call
things what they are?

09:02.504 --> 09:04.177
Bridge builders and building builders.

09:04.178 --> 09:06.489
- That's just embarrassing.
- And it's on TV.

09:06.490 --> 09:10.081
Oh! Hey, guys! Hi, Darrin! What's going on?

09:10.082 --> 09:11.302
We're doing a talk show.

09:11.303 --> 09:12.531
[Gasps] Ooh! Let me get coffee.

09:12.532 --> 09:13.967
Guests on talk shows always have coffee.

09:14.530 --> 09:17.170
Oh, I remember. I do
have an upcoming project.

09:17.171 --> 09:18.495
Well, great.

09:18.496 --> 09:20.384
I'm going to the fall fantasy dance.

09:21.196 --> 09:22.254
You are?

09:22.255 --> 09:25.522
Yeah. It's at the banquet hall of the
cozy stay suites and corporate center.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.082
And it's semi-formal...
that's almost formal.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.898
Wow, so... so you have a date?

09:29.899 --> 09:31.961
No, but most people go in groups.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.643
Okay, so you're going with a group.

09:33.644 --> 09:34.787
That, I will not.

09:34.788 --> 09:38.290
So, you're just gonna
walk into a ballroom alone?

09:38.291 --> 09:40.458
Do you know anybody else that's going?

09:40.459 --> 09:43.051
- Nope.
- Whoa. That's hardcore.

09:43.052 --> 09:44.602
Sue: Okay, I'm ready.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.082
Sorry, sue. You're getting bumped.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.634
What? I didn't even get to talk!

09:47.635 --> 09:49.363
We're out of time. We
got to go to commercial.

09:54.533 --> 09:57.673
<i>So, Brick was determined to go
stag to the fall fantasy dance...</i>

09:57.674 --> 10:00.415
<i>The fantasy being that
this was a good idea.</i>

10:00.416 --> 10:01.710
Show us your cellphone.

10:01.711 --> 10:02.711
Mm.

10:03.919 --> 10:06.540
- Any holes in your pockets?
- No.

10:06.541 --> 10:07.599
Now show us your ticket.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.042
And show us your cellphone again.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.921
[Sighs]

10:12.922 --> 10:14.715
Okay. You're good.

10:14.716 --> 10:15.906
[Sighs]

10:15.907 --> 10:17.324
Oh. One last thing.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.547
Can you teach me how to dance?

10:19.181 --> 10:20.740
Now?

10:20.741 --> 10:23.012
Why did you wait till the last minute?

10:23.013 --> 10:26.396
Well, it just occurred to me that
this dance might include dancing.

10:26.397 --> 10:28.965
Okay, well, I mean, it's been a while,

10:28.966 --> 10:31.006
but... There's, um...

10:31.007 --> 10:32.948
There's this.

10:32.949 --> 10:34.255
[Chuckles]

10:34.256 --> 10:36.627
And, uh... Oh, oh! This.

10:37.615 --> 10:38.618
Right?

10:38.619 --> 10:41.498
Actually, I was thinking more like
how you might dance with a girl.

10:41.499 --> 10:43.150
Oh! Okay.

10:43.151 --> 10:46.190
Um... Well, let's see.

10:46.191 --> 10:48.208
- You put this hand up there, like that.
- Mm-hmm.

10:48.209 --> 10:50.923
Yes, and then you put your right
hand on her waist, like that.

10:50.924 --> 10:52.104
And then...

10:52.105 --> 10:55.923
You just kind of, I don't...
guide her back and forth.

10:55.924 --> 10:58.132
Yeah.

10:58.133 --> 10:59.940
Good!

10:59.941 --> 11:04.037
Well, hey, Brick, you're already
a better dancer than your dad.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.436
Standing right here.

11:05.437 --> 11:06.564
Thanks, mom.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.324
Oh! Forgot my breath mints.

11:09.325 --> 11:11.371
That could have been a
real turnoff to a girl.

11:11.372 --> 11:12.500
Whoop!

11:12.501 --> 11:13.796
[Sighs]

11:13.797 --> 11:14.867
Ugh.

11:14.868 --> 11:17.972
Mike, I just want it to
go well for him, you know?

11:17.973 --> 11:20.987
I just want him to ask a girl
to dance and for her to say yes,

11:20.988 --> 11:22.628
and I don't want him to be crushed...

11:22.629 --> 11:25.689
Okay, let's get you to
the dance, Mr. Sharp!

11:25.690 --> 11:28.109
[Groans loudly]

11:28.110 --> 11:31.317
Could you moan more softly, please?

11:31.318 --> 11:36.085
Oh, God, I am crashing,
Axl, and I'm crashing hard.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.573
I rode the caffeine pony,

11:37.574 --> 11:39.117
and it took me to the depths of hell.

11:39.118 --> 11:41.726
Sue, you drank coffee for two days.

11:41.727 --> 11:43.198
I'm having a real crisis here.

11:43.199 --> 11:46.125
I've got till midnight to decide what
I'm doing with the rest of my life.

11:46.126 --> 11:47.937
Do you want to talk about it over coffee?

11:47.938 --> 11:49.417
Oh! I can't.

11:49.418 --> 11:50.986
I'm seven hours clean.

11:50.987 --> 11:52.890
Here, I'll... I'll just hold an empty mug.

11:54.954 --> 11:56.377
Seriously, sue, what should I do?

11:56.378 --> 11:57.504
No one can tell you.

11:57.505 --> 11:59.808
<i>You got to figure out what you want.</i>

11:59.809 --> 12:01.903
Ohh, everybody's always
telling me what to do,

12:01.904 --> 12:04.634
<i>but now I want them to tell
me what to do, and nobody will.</i>

12:04.635 --> 12:05.775
Wait a minute.

12:05.776 --> 12:08.064
There's a resource that's perfect for this.

12:08.065 --> 12:10.440
It can help you find out about yourself

12:10.441 --> 12:12.320
<i>and help you with career choices.</i>

12:12.321 --> 12:14.136
Oh, yeah!

kickinitteenstyle.com.

12:16.201 --> 12:18.088
[Groans]

12:24.644 --> 12:27.179
One more time... show me
your ticket and cellphone.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.449
All right. When do you want us to get you?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.418
Well, the dance goes till 11:00,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.553
but I might want to hang out
with the friends I meet after,

12:34.554 --> 12:35.754
so let's say...

12:35.755 --> 12:36.822
11:01.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.592
Okay, then.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.659
Have fun.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.197
Go get 'em, kid.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.137
Why is he standing there?

12:52.138 --> 12:55.140
He's just standing there outside the door.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.076
Oh, God. He's turning around.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.011
Oh, he's coming back. He's coming back.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.014
Nope.
Turning around again.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.482
Now he's doing the robot outside.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.550
Oh, God.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.985
Why's he doing the robot outside?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.420
I can't look. Just tell
me what's happening.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.589
Well, he stopped dancing.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.325
Now he's reading a parking sign.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.994
And... He dropped his ticket.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.061
Ugh.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.496
Picking it up...

13:17.497 --> 13:18.964
Blowing on it.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.800
Come on, buddy. Head for that door!

13:21.801 --> 13:23.702
Now he's moving again.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.738
Got his hand on the door.

13:26.482 --> 13:28.438
- Oh, he's waving!
- Oh!

13:28.439 --> 13:29.720
Bye!

13:29.721 --> 13:30.975
He's in.

13:32.006 --> 13:33.727
Oh, God. He's in.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.727
<i>So, it was good.</i>

13:36.728 --> 13:38.774
<i>We successfully delivered
Brick to his dance,</i>

13:38.775 --> 13:40.935
<i>and we were feeling cautiously optimis...</i>

13:40.936 --> 13:42.308
[Cellphone vibrates]

13:42.309 --> 13:43.532
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

13:43.533 --> 13:45.792
Oh, crap. "Come get me."

13:54.573 --> 13:56.307
Okay, question 3.

13:56.308 --> 13:57.754
"You're late to a party.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.334
Do you, 'A', take your pink sweater,

14:00.335 --> 14:03.075
'B', your boyfriend's
arms will keep you warm,

14:03.076 --> 14:05.800
or 'C', you have five
sweaters to pick from,

14:05.801 --> 14:08.043
and you've known for weeks
which one you're wearing?"

14:08.044 --> 14:10.034
"D." This party sounds lame. I'm not going.

14:10.035 --> 14:11.859
Look, do you want to pick a major or not?

14:11.860 --> 14:16.456
"Now, which 1D lyrics are you
most likely to hang on your wall?"

14:20.149 --> 14:21.827
Look, we got to stay positive.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.789
We might be picking him
up for a good reason.

14:23.790 --> 14:24.932
There could be a fire.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.605
- [Cellphone vibrates]
- Mm.

14:26.606 --> 14:28.593
"Never mind. I'm okay."

14:28.594 --> 14:30.228
He's okay. Let's go.

14:30.229 --> 14:33.884
<i>What does that mean, "I'm okay"?
Was he previously not okay?</i>

14:33.885 --> 14:35.756
<i>Let's not go looking for problems.</i>

14:35.757 --> 14:37.796
[Sighs] Can we just wait a few minutes?

14:37.797 --> 14:39.485
I don't want to drive all the way home

14:39.486 --> 14:40.612
and then have to turn back.

14:40.613 --> 14:41.964
Fine.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.606
[Sighs]

14:44.075 --> 14:45.690
Want to make out?

14:45.691 --> 14:47.018
Sure.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.417
But you'll have to come this way,

14:48.418 --> 14:49.777
'cause I slept on my neck weird.

14:49.778 --> 14:51.081
Mm.

14:51.082 --> 14:54.337
Okay, you answered
mostly C's with a few B's,

14:54.338 --> 14:56.339
which makes you a...

14:57.564 --> 14:58.841
Social Sally.

<i>That is me! That is so me!</i>

15:06.898 --> 15:07.989
Ha ha!

15:07.990 --> 15:10.733
So, your possible career choices are...

15:10.734 --> 15:13.541
Salon receptionist, spinning instructor,

15:13.542 --> 15:16.541
and handbag designer to the stars.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.132
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.390
What happens if I answer all D's?

15:20.391 --> 15:22.337
Ahhh.

15:22.921 --> 15:24.162
That's it. I'm going in.

15:24.163 --> 15:25.841
Oh. Hey. Frankie.

15:25.842 --> 15:27.602
It's a junior-high dance.

15:27.603 --> 15:29.193
<i>If you think Brick can't fit in now,</i>

15:29.194 --> 15:31.466
wait till the other kids
see his mommy show up.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.290
He'll be a marked man till college.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.394
Fine.

15:34.395 --> 15:36.346
I just hope it's going well.

15:36.347 --> 15:39.161
- Still hanging on to hope, huh?
- [Sighs]

15:39.162 --> 15:41.330
I don't know why you're
getting so worked up about this.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.458
I mean, it's not a new situation.

15:43.459 --> 15:45.010
We've been dealing with
this for a long time.

15:45.011 --> 15:46.498
I know, but this is different.

15:46.499 --> 15:48.515
<i>Before, I wanted him to have friends.</i>

15:48.516 --> 15:50.555
<i>It's worse now 'cause he wants it.</i>

15:50.556 --> 15:52.905
Well, maybe he's not gonna get it.

15:52.906 --> 15:53.908
Mm.

15:53.909 --> 15:57.543
I just don't understand
why this is so hard for him.

15:57.544 --> 15:59.119
[Sighs]

15:59.120 --> 16:02.415
Could we have done more...
you know, as parents?

16:02.416 --> 16:05.158
Well, I think it's safe to
say we could have done more.

16:05.159 --> 16:08.048
- [Sighs]
- But Brick is who he is.

16:08.049 --> 16:10.298
They come out how they come out.

16:10.299 --> 16:12.344
Maybe he's just always
gonna be a quirky kid.

16:14.376 --> 16:17.016
I should have been nicer to Billy Fry.

16:18.180 --> 16:19.716
We used to make fun of him at recess

16:19.717 --> 16:20.889
'cause he licked worms.

16:20.890 --> 16:22.068
Mm.

16:22.069 --> 16:23.766
Now I know who that kid is.

16:23.767 --> 16:25.032
He's Brick.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.859
Please tell me Brick isn't
gonna start licking worms.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.353
<i>Point is, at least it's not on us.</i>

16:31.970 --> 16:33.505
That should make us feel better.

16:34.485 --> 16:35.713
Yeah.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.147
"Should."

16:37.873 --> 16:39.552
[Doors open]

16:39.553 --> 16:40.969
Oh, look. Here he comes.

16:40.970 --> 16:42.487
Act casual.

16:42.488 --> 16:47.122
[Dance music playing in distance]

16:47.123 --> 16:49.381
Hey! There's Mr. sharp!

16:49.382 --> 16:50.803
Where's your shoe?

16:52.219 --> 16:55.594
Did you lose it dancing?

16:55.595 --> 16:57.130
I don't know.

16:57.131 --> 16:58.922
Did a bully take it?

16:58.923 --> 17:00.106
I don't know.

17:00.107 --> 17:02.491
- Well...
- Doesn't matter. Get in.

17:06.865 --> 17:09.184
- So, how was it?
- Fine.

17:09.185 --> 17:10.416
And you had a good time?

17:10.417 --> 17:11.473
I guess so.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.631
Did you hang out with anybody?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.295
I don't really want to talk about it.

17:17.059 --> 17:19.066
[Engine turns over]

17:21.709 --> 17:23.012
Axl.

17:23.012 --> 17:24.723
What are you doing up here?

17:25.781 --> 17:27.395
Sometimes I come up here to think...

17:27.396 --> 17:29.636
And occasionally throw things.

17:29.637 --> 17:32.212
Wait a second. Do you ever throw...

17:32.213 --> 17:34.355
Acorns at your head? Yes. All the time.

17:34.356 --> 17:36.403
[Groans]

17:36.404 --> 17:38.452
What am I doing with my life?

17:38.453 --> 17:42.373
It was so much easier when I wanted
to be a fireman or a superhero.

17:42.374 --> 17:44.053
God! I wish I was still 17.

17:44.054 --> 17:47.150
I don't know what you're
so worried about, Axl.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.401
Things always turn out fine for you.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.523
Hmm.

17:50.524 --> 17:51.666
You're right.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.090
I was losing sight of my awesomeness.

17:54.091 --> 17:55.514
[Chuckles] Thanks.

17:55.515 --> 17:57.033
You know...

17:57.034 --> 17:59.546
You're not the worst
sister a person could have.

17:59.547 --> 18:01.284
Really?

18:01.285 --> 18:04.074
Yeah, I guess you're, uh,
pretty good at helping people.

18:04.075 --> 18:05.282
You think so?

18:05.283 --> 18:08.810
Because I just love helping people so much.

18:08.811 --> 18:10.937
You know, I haven't told anybody this yet,

18:10.938 --> 18:14.721
but I was thinking maybe
I'd major in psychology.

18:14.722 --> 18:16.069
Huh.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.357
- Cool, I think I'll do that.
- What?!

18:19.358 --> 18:21.852
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
be a psychology major.

18:21.853 --> 18:25.036
No, no, no! You can't do that!

18:25.037 --> 18:27.588
You are gonna steal my
major and ruin it for me!

18:27.589 --> 18:29.388
Mm. And how does that make you feel?

18:29.389 --> 18:30.924
Oh, no!

18:30.925 --> 18:32.332
This is so not fair!

18:32.333 --> 18:34.613
You won't even try, and
you'll be good at it anyway.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.879
And then you'll take my job

18:35.880 --> 18:38.395
because there can't be two
psychologists in one family.

18:38.396 --> 18:40.723
- That's never done!
- Well, I'm doing it.

18:40.724 --> 18:42.035
[Sighs]

18:42.036 --> 18:44.560
Fine. Then I am going to your college.

18:44.561 --> 18:45.821
You cannot go to my college!

18:45.822 --> 18:48.364
If you're stealing my major,
then I am stealing your college!

18:48.365 --> 18:49.842
Shut your fat mouth, Sue!

18:49.843 --> 18:51.273
<i>Oh, you shut your fat mouth!</i>

18:51.274 --> 18:52.428
Oh, way to copy me!

18:52.429 --> 18:54.860
<i>You are copying me!</i>

18:54.861 --> 18:56.575
You're stealing my major!

18:57.215 --> 19:00.509
Okay, okay, you know what,
Axl? I can't take this anymore!

19:00.510 --> 19:02.357
I tried to help you, and instead...

19:02.358 --> 19:04.862
aaaaaaaaaah!

19:04.863 --> 19:06.151
Sue!

19:09.864 --> 19:11.480
Axl, help!

19:11.481 --> 19:13.863
I'll help you if you say you
will not come to my school.

19:13.864 --> 19:16.918
I won't take your hand until you
say you're not taking my major!

19:16.919 --> 19:18.959
Whatever! Kiss the pavement! See if I care!

19:18.960 --> 19:20.407
What?!

19:20.408 --> 19:21.954
And you know, Brick, here's the thing.

19:21.955 --> 19:24.626
This might not be your time
right now, but actually,

19:24.627 --> 19:28.427
Suzanne Somers had a great
quote in her hormone book.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.009
He's been asleep for the last five minutes.

19:30.010 --> 19:33.051
[Sighs] Why didn't you tell me?

19:33.052 --> 19:35.513
You seemed to be making
yourself feel better.

19:35.514 --> 19:37.770
Look, Frankie, he'll be fine.

19:37.771 --> 19:40.578
Look at how much we
worried about Axl and Sue,

19:40.579 --> 19:42.082
and we hardly ever
worry about them anymore.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.559
- Sue: No!
- Axl: Just jump! Please!

19:49.151 --> 19:50.436
You... stay off the roof.

19:50.437 --> 19:52.332
And you... you're majoring in business.

19:52.333 --> 19:55.047
Oh! Thank you! [Chuckles]

19:55.048 --> 19:58.095
<i>The thing is, you never stop
worrying about your kids.</i>

19:58.096 --> 20:00.472
<i>Sometimes they need you to
scrape them off the roof.</i>

20:01.091 --> 20:03.782
<i>Sometimes you have to
give them a little nudge.</i>

20:03.783 --> 20:04.871
Boom! Business!

20:04.872 --> 20:06.751
In before the stroke of midnight.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.015
Whoo!

20:08.016 --> 20:10.990
<i>And sometimes, you get a fairy-tale ending</i>

20:10.991 --> 20:13.175
<i>without even helping them at all.</i>

20:13.176 --> 20:15.350
- [Doorbell rings]
- Brick: I'll get it!

20:17.777 --> 20:20.305
I was at the dance last
night. You left your shoe.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.889
Oh. Thanks.

20:21.890 --> 20:23.296
I'm Cindy.

20:23.297 --> 20:25.769
I'm gonna get some frozen
yogurt. Want to come?

20:25.770 --> 20:27.633
No. I'm full.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.669
<i>Well, sometimes you got to help a little.</i>

20:31.718 --> 20:34.205
Brick, she was asking you out.

20:34.206 --> 20:36.336
- Really?
- Yes! Go! Go!

20:38.175 --> 20:39.672
Wait up! I'm coming!

20:39.673 --> 20:41.056
Brick! Book!

20:45.492 --> 20:46.945
So, where did you find my shoe?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.386
Under the table.

20:48.387 --> 20:51.250
Really? Thought it was there.

20:58.988 --> 21:01.714
His text said "come get me.
It's not going well in here."

21:01.715 --> 21:03.503
Mine says "I'm fine. I want to stay."

21:03.504 --> 21:05.551
- Why is he texting us separately?
- [Cellphone chimes]

21:06.105 --> 21:07.138
Uh-oh.

21:07.139 --> 21:09.108
"She doesn't like 'planet nowhere.'"

21:09.109 --> 21:11.131
Ugh. Well, that's the end of that.

21:11.132 --> 21:13.034
[Cellphone vibrates]

21:13.035 --> 21:14.962
"Never mind. She was just kidding."

21:14.963 --> 21:18.335
And then he put a smiley
face with a frog thing.

21:18.336 --> 21:19.649
Do you know what that means?

21:20.961 --> 21:22.136
How long should we wait?

21:22.605 --> 21:23.956
I don't know.

21:27.293 --> 21:28.732
Want to make out?

21:28.733 --> 21:32.763
