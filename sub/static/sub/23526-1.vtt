<b>- Hello.</b>

00:07.074 --> 00:09.276
<b>- Blessed weather</b>

00:09.309 --> 00:10.744

<b>Can you believe</b>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.616
<b>- Oh, blessed be.</b>

00:15.649 --> 00:18.151
<b>- Do you think there will be</b>
<b>lots of twists and turns</b>

00:18.185 --> 00:20.754
<b>and shocks and surprises</b>
<b>this season?</b>

00:20.787 --> 00:22.222
<b>- Oh, bitch.</b>

00:22.256 --> 00:24.458
<b>- And do you think</b>
<b>some of the eliminated queens</b>

00:24.491 --> 00:26.226
<b>will get to Ru-turn</b>
<b>for their Ru-venge?</b>

00:26.260 --> 00:27.561
<b>- Mm-hmm.</b>

00:27.594 --> 00:30.230
<b>Oh, my God, they're not</b>
<b>gonna know what hit 'em.</b>

00:30.264 --> 00:33.567

00:44.945 --> 00:46.914
<b>[both sigh]</b>

00:49.850 --> 00:51.618

<b>- Thanks, girl.</b>

00:52.653 --> 00:53.987

<b>That's how I roll.</b>

<b>That is such</b>

01:33.927 --> 01:35.462
<b>That would've killed</b>
<b>if someone was here.</b>

01:35.495 --> 01:37.297
<b>I'm Trixie Mattel,</b>

01:37.331 --> 01:40.234
<b>and I am the crownless drag</b>

01:40.267 --> 01:42.402
<b>I came here to eclipse</b>
<b>people with my talent,</b>

01:42.436 --> 01:43.871
<b>but also with my hair.</b>

01:43.904 --> 01:45.339
<b>There's nobody in here.</b>

01:45.372 --> 01:47.307
<b>It's like a Morgan McMichaels</b>
<b>meet-and-greet.</b>

01:47.341 --> 01:50.577
<b>I feel like in the real world</b>
<b>I've been a real all star,</b>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.446
<b>but on "Drag Race"</b>
<b>I was not an all star.</b>

01:52.479 --> 01:53.680
<b>Howdy, y'all.</b>

01:53.714 --> 01:55.616
<b>- You went</b>
<b>for the comedy gold,</b>

01:55.649 --> 01:57.651
<b>but all we got was bronze.</b>

01:57.684 --> 02:01.154
<b>- I need to make amends</b>
<b>for the fact that I came in here</b>

02:01.188 --> 02:02.289
<b>and just hit the cement</b>

02:02.322 --> 02:04.591
<b>and got dragged out</b>
<b>like a dead body.</b>

02:04.625 --> 02:05.826
<b>Twice.</b>

02:05.859 --> 02:07.127
<b>It's not about falling.</b>

02:07.160 --> 02:09.062
<b>It's about getting back up.</b>

02:15.903 --> 02:17.371
<b>- I..</b>

02:17.404 --> 02:19.406
<b>just farted.</b>

02:19.439 --> 02:21.175
<b>- [laughs]</b>

<b>- Hey, kids, Zaddy's home.</b>

02:23.677 --> 02:25.746
<b>- Lady, my dairy queen.</b>

02:25.779 --> 02:28.148
<b>- Ooh!</b>

02:28.182 --> 02:32.386
<b>The Milk fans will remember</b>
<b>my outside of the carton--</b>

02:32.419 --> 02:33.453
<b>See the joke there?</b>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.556
<b>Outside of the carton</b>
<b>thinking.</b>

02:35.589 --> 02:37.824
<b>- She's got</b>
<b>a real nose for fashion.</b>

02:37.858 --> 02:39.159
<b>- Hello, hello, hello.</b>

02:39.193 --> 02:41.094
<b>I'm thinking about</b>
<b>wearing facial hair.</b>

02:41.128 --> 02:42.462
<b>- Hope you're packed.</b>

02:42.496 --> 02:44.898
<b>- I don't regret</b>
<b>anything that I did</b>

02:44.932 --> 02:48.101
<b>because it got me into</b>
<b>a Marc Jacobs ad campaign,</b>

02:48.101 --> 02:50.103
<b>and it got me notoriety.</b>

02:50.103 --> 02:53.373
<b>She was cover girl,</b>
<b>French Vogue.</b>

02:53.407 --> 02:55.909
<b>I cannot believe you</b>
<b>[bleep] showed up here.</b>

02:55.943 --> 02:57.444
<b>Don't touch me.</b>
<b>- Good to see you.</b>

02:57.477 --> 03:01.114
<b>- I very much expected</b>
<b>to see Trixie here.</b>

03:01.148 --> 03:02.516
<b>- Whoo!</b>

03:02.549 --> 03:04.618
<b>- Like myself,</b>
<b>she really proved</b>

03:04.651 --> 03:06.253
<b>that she was an all star</b>
<b>off the show,</b>

03:06.286 --> 03:09.056
<b>but she sort of sucks</b>
<b>in comparison to me.</b>

03:10.424 --> 03:12.359
<b>- Wake up, wake up, wake up!</b>

03:12.392 --> 03:13.760
<b>This ain't no dream.</b>

03:13.794 --> 03:16.496
<b>I'm back, the bayou queen.</b>

03:18.632 --> 03:20.334
<b>- Did it just get swampy</b>
<b>in here?</b>

03:21.335 --> 03:22.469
<b>I'm Chi Chi DeVayne,</b>

03:22.503 --> 03:24.471
<b>and y'all girls</b>
<b>better get ready</b>

03:24.505 --> 03:25.506
<b>'cause I'm ready.</b>

03:25.539 --> 03:27.541
<b>I told you I stay ready.</b>

03:27.574 --> 03:28.742
<b>My mama ready.</b>

03:28.775 --> 03:30.143
<b>Who's into glamour?</b>

03:30.177 --> 03:31.712
<b>Who doesn't like a old</b>
<b>smoked turkey neck back?</b>

03:31.745 --> 03:34.248
<b>- You turned it</b>
<b>completely out.</b>

03:34.281 --> 03:35.549
<b>- Tell me why</b>
<b>you're out here</b>

03:35.582 --> 03:37.551
<b>in a bathing suit</b>
<b>with no corset and a belt.</b>

03:37.584 --> 03:39.686
<b>- I don't have the expenses</b>

03:39.720 --> 03:41.255
<b>to pay</b>
<b>for something like this.</b>

03:41.288 --> 03:42.556
<b>- You don't need money,</b>
<b>girl.</b>

03:42.589 --> 03:44.124
<b>That's never an excuse.</b>

03:44.157 --> 03:45.859
<b>- Hey! [laughs]</b>

03:45.893 --> 03:47.528
<b>- Hey, baby!</b>

03:47.561 --> 03:51.098
<b>- I was the trash bag queen</b>
<b>that had a heart of gold.</b>

03:51.131 --> 03:52.699
<b>I just wasn't</b>
<b>polished enough.</b>

03:52.733 --> 03:55.135
<b>But this time I got</b>
<b>my mind together,</b>

03:55.169 --> 03:56.803
<b>I got my drag together.</b>

03:56.837 --> 03:58.005
<b>It's all together, girl.</b>

03:58.105 --> 04:00.407
<b>Oh, oh, hat coming off.</b>

04:00.440 --> 04:02.209
<b>- Is this trash?</b>
<b>- Trash bags.</b>

04:02.242 --> 04:04.211
<b>- I thought garbage day</b>
<b>was Tuesday.</b>

04:04.244 --> 04:07.047
<b>- Chi Chi's here,</b>
<b>and she wore garbage again,</b>

04:08.048 --> 04:09.683
<b>And also trash bags.</b>

04:09.716 --> 04:10.717
<b>- Uh-oh.</b>

04:10.751 --> 04:12.052
<b>- That hat</b>
<b>is your inner saboteur,</b>

04:12.052 --> 04:13.754
<b>and I want you to let it go.</b>

04:13.787 --> 04:15.455
<b>- [laughs]</b>

04:16.924 --> 04:18.392
<b>Whoo!</b>

04:18.425 --> 04:19.493
<b>- Oh, [bleep].</b>

04:19.526 --> 04:21.395
<b>- [hums] Ow.</b>

04:21.428 --> 04:23.664
<b>I think I just broke</b>
<b>my ankle doing that.</b>

04:23.697 --> 04:25.065
<b>- My name is Thorgy Thor.</b>

04:25.065 --> 04:28.635
<b>I was on Season 8,</b>
<b>and I made top six,</b>

04:28.669 --> 04:30.704
<b>or as some of my enemies</b>
<b>like to say, bottom seven.</b>

04:30.737 --> 04:33.273
<b>I'm colorful, I'm fun,</b>
<b>and I'm the fashion clown.</b>

04:33.307 --> 04:35.843
<b>Whoo! I love everyone.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

04:37.978 --> 04:39.646
<b>- Bob, please shut up.</b>

04:39.680 --> 04:41.315
<b>[all laugh]</b>

04:41.348 --> 04:42.716
<b>- An issue I dealt with</b>
<b>on Season 8</b>

04:42.749 --> 04:44.151
<b>is that I'm constantly</b>
<b>distracted by everything,</b>

04:44.184 --> 04:46.086
<b>but I think 50% of it</b>

04:46.086 --> 04:48.322
<b>was just because</b>
<b>Bob never shuts up.</b>

04:48.355 --> 04:51.959
<b>And since the show,</b>
<b>I've found ways to focus.</b>

04:51.992 --> 04:53.327
<b>Ooh.</b>

04:54.828 --> 04:56.129
<b>I think I'm going crazy.</b>

04:56.163 --> 04:57.664
<b>Oh, there is one.</b>

04:57.698 --> 05:00.100
<b>Sorry. That's gonna</b>
<b>drive me ♪ insane </b>

05:00.133 --> 05:02.703
<b>Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes!</b>

05:02.736 --> 05:04.338
<b>- Oh, God.</b>

05:04.371 --> 05:06.106
<b>- All Season 8,</b>

05:06.139 --> 05:09.376
<b>Thorgy complained</b>
<b>that she didn't win</b>

05:09.409 --> 05:12.045
<b>because it was The Bob Show.</b>

05:12.045 --> 05:14.314
<b>Okay, girl,</b>
<b>ain't no Bob here.</b>

05:14.348 --> 05:15.516
<b>Let's see what you got.</b>

05:15.549 --> 05:16.850
<b>- Is this yours?</b>
<b>- Yes.</b>

05:16.884 --> 05:18.118
<b>- Can I try this?</b>

05:18.151 --> 05:19.253
<b>- That's what</b>
<b>you should have come in.</b>

05:19.286 --> 05:20.854
<b>- Oh, can I have this?</b>
<b>[laughs]</b>

05:20.888 --> 05:25.626
<b>- Miss Thorgy Thor,</b>
<b>made top four, you didn't.</b>

05:25.659 --> 05:27.628
<b>[laughs]</b>

05:31.064 --> 05:33.967
<b>- I look pretty good</b>
<b>for a dead bitch.</b>

05:34.067 --> 05:35.335
<b>- She's alive!</b>

05:35.369 --> 05:36.770
<b>- My name</b>
<b>is Morgan McMichaels.</b>

05:36.803 --> 05:37.871
<b>I'm from Season 2,</b>

05:37.905 --> 05:39.573
<b>and I'm here</b>
<b>to rock the [bleep]</b>

05:39.606 --> 05:41.642
<b>out of "All Stars Season 3,"</b>
<b>bitch.</b>

05:41.675 --> 05:43.911
<b>You can't kill evil</b>
<b>that easy.</b>

05:43.944 --> 05:46.747
<b>- She's a punk dude.</b>
<b>- Rock 'n' roll, baby.</b>

05:46.780 --> 05:48.315
<b>I wonder what everyone's</b>
<b>gonna look like out of drag.</b>

05:48.348 --> 05:51.151
<b>I hope some of you are</b>
<b>attractive boys like me.</b>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.587
<b>Go fix your hair,</b>
<b>fix your mug.</b>

05:53.620 --> 05:54.888
<b>- I don't need</b>
<b>to fix my mug, bitch.</b>

05:54.922 --> 05:56.423
<b>- Honey, you do need</b>
<b>to fix your mug.</b>

05:56.456 --> 05:59.326
<b>On Season 2, I was very blunt</b>
<b>with my opinions,</b>

05:59.359 --> 06:01.662
<b>and I still kind of</b>
<b>have that to this day.</b>

06:01.695 --> 06:03.697
<b>You know me, sharp-tongued.</b>

06:03.730 --> 06:05.933
<b>- Hi!</b>
<b>- How you doing?</b>

06:06.033 --> 06:07.568
<b>- Hello, beautiful.</b>

06:07.601 --> 06:09.937
<b>- Morgan being here is</b>
<b>definitely intimidating.</b>

06:10.037 --> 06:11.238
<b>She's a workhorse.</b>

06:11.271 --> 06:12.239
<b>She probably</b>
<b>is the only girl</b>

06:12.272 --> 06:14.141
<b>that works seven days a week</b>

06:14.174 --> 06:16.577
<b>in Hollywood at every club,</b>

06:16.610 --> 06:19.046
<b>so she's definitely</b>
<b>gonna be one to beat.</b>

06:19.046 --> 06:21.748
<b>- I feel like I'm thanking</b>
<b>a veteran for their service,</b>

06:21.782 --> 06:23.050
<b>because we wouldn't be here</b>
<b>if you weren't here.</b>

06:23.050 --> 06:25.419
<b>- I fought for my country.</b>
<b>Now, what is this look?</b>

06:25.452 --> 06:27.654
<b>- It' s my denim</b>
<b>Pinocchio look.</b>

06:27.688 --> 06:30.424
<b>I'm here to inspire</b>
<b>future challenges.</b>

06:30.457 --> 06:33.093
<b>- One thing I'm not a big fan of</b>
<b>is diva-dom.</b>

06:33.126 --> 06:35.462
<b>I think I'm gonna have to smack</b>
<b>that bitch down a little bit.</b>

06:35.495 --> 06:36.797
<b>- Good cast so far.</b>

06:36.830 --> 06:39.099
<b>Who's gonna [bleep] it up?</b>

06:39.132 --> 06:40.501
<b>[bell rings]</b>

06:40.534 --> 06:42.135
<b>- Hey, yo, stretch.</b>

06:42.169 --> 06:43.237
<b>- Oh, Lord.</b>

06:43.270 --> 06:45.772
<b>- I have some</b>
<b>unfinished business.</b>

06:45.806 --> 06:47.841
<b>- Trixie,</b>
<b>she stole your act.</b>

06:47.875 --> 06:50.177
<b>- No, you have</b>
<b>to wait there.</b>

06:50.210 --> 06:52.846
<b>- I [bleep] it up</b>
<b>every time.</b>

06:52.880 --> 06:56.216
<b>My name is Aja,</b>
<b>and I'm here to [bleep] it up.</b>

06:56.250 --> 06:57.985
<b>I'm sorry, I am.</b>

06:58.085 --> 07:00.787
<b>- Your makeup is very dark.</b>

07:00.821 --> 07:02.923
<b>- She could walk out there</b>
<b>in a [bleep] diaper</b>

07:03.023 --> 07:08.629
<b>and they're like, Valentina,</b>
<b>your smile is beautiful.</b>

07:08.662 --> 07:09.796
<b>I just don't feel like</b>

07:09.830 --> 07:11.732
<b>you should be</b>
<b>Miss Congeniality.</b>

07:14.101 --> 07:16.036
<b>- Oh, my God, hi.</b>

07:16.036 --> 07:17.604
<b>Walking into Season 9,</b>
<b>I was thinking</b>

07:17.638 --> 07:18.906
<b>I was the [bleep]</b>
<b>and I was gonna win,</b>

07:18.939 --> 07:20.774
<b>and I was, like,</b>
<b>oh, yes, I got this.</b>

07:20.807 --> 07:23.076
<b>And then the challenges</b>
<b>and the runways came along,</b>

07:23.110 --> 07:25.078
<b>and I was, like,</b>
<b>I don't look that good.</b>

07:25.112 --> 07:27.047
<b>I'm not doing that good.</b>
<b>I'm not feeling that good.</b>

07:27.047 --> 07:28.248
<b>And then I went home.</b>

07:28.282 --> 07:30.150
<b>- She got</b>
<b>her lips done, too.</b>

07:30.184 --> 07:32.753
<b>- I had my lips, my cheeks,</b>
<b>my chin, my skin.</b>

07:32.786 --> 07:34.888
<b>I had Botox in my forehead.</b>

07:34.922 --> 07:36.790
<b>- You're a drag queen</b>
<b>who got more chin?</b>

07:36.823 --> 07:38.792
<b>- Well, bitch, I didn't</b>
<b>have one to begin with.</b>

07:38.825 --> 07:41.962
<b>I was having like the Alyssa</b>
<b>Edwards, like, Season 5 chin,</b>

07:42.062 --> 07:43.764
<b>like, the nonexistent one.</b>

07:43.797 --> 07:47.234
<b>I kind of felt like</b>
<b>the ugly duckling of Season 9,</b>

07:47.267 --> 07:49.169
<b>but I think in a weird way</b>

07:49.203 --> 07:52.306
<b>it really did benefit me</b>
<b>to get criticized by the world.</b>

07:52.339 --> 07:55.809
<b>I mean, look at her.</b>
<b>I am HD ready.</b>

07:55.843 --> 07:57.444
<b>There is no face tune here.</b>

07:57.477 --> 07:58.512
<b>Bitch, they're</b>
<b>gonna be telling me</b>

07:58.545 --> 07:59.813
<b>my smile is beautiful.</b>
<b>Watch.</b>

07:59.847 --> 08:01.215
<b>[laughs]</b>

08:03.450 --> 08:06.253
<b>- Hi, everyone.</b>
<b>It's me, BenDeLaCreme.</b>

08:06.286 --> 08:08.822
<b>Again.</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

08:08.856 --> 08:12.092
<b>My name is BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>and I placed fifth on Season 6.</b>

08:13.093 --> 08:15.829
<b>I am wearing</b>
<b>a repurposed version</b>

08:15.863 --> 08:18.398
<b>of the gown that I wore</b>

08:18.432 --> 08:21.034
<b>where I was crowned</b>
<b>Season 6 Miss Congeniality.</b>

08:21.034 --> 08:22.336
<b>I've just been</b>
<b>sleeping in it</b>

08:22.369 --> 08:25.205
<b>and spooning</b>
<b>my Miss Congeniality sash</b>

08:25.239 --> 08:27.441
<b>and weeping into my</b>
<b>Overstock gift certificate</b>

08:27.474 --> 08:28.642
<b>for the last four years.</b>

08:28.675 --> 08:30.277
<b>Aah!</b>

08:30.310 --> 08:33.046
<b>BenDeLaCreme</b>
<b>is terminally delightful.</b>

08:33.046 --> 08:35.816
<b>Excuse me, we originated</b>
<b>the language.</b>

08:35.849 --> 08:37.551
<b>- Bitch stole your look.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

08:37.584 --> 08:39.419
<b>- BenDeLaCreme Visage.</b>

08:39.453 --> 08:41.388
<b>- This time I'm here</b>
<b>to get that crown</b>

08:41.421 --> 08:43.056
<b>that I didn't get</b>
<b>the first time,</b>

08:43.056 --> 08:44.391
<b>but I'm also here to show</b>

08:44.424 --> 08:46.827
<b>that you can win</b>
<b>with kindness and integrity</b>

08:46.860 --> 08:48.795
<b>rather than be a bitch.</b>

08:48.829 --> 08:51.198
<b>Oh, crap,</b>
<b>is this an intervention?</b>

08:51.231 --> 08:52.199
<b>- How you doing?</b>

08:52.232 --> 08:54.268
<b>- Good, how are you?</b>
<b>- I'm very good.</b>

08:54.301 --> 08:55.702
<b>- Ben, you're still alive.</b>

08:55.736 --> 08:58.906
<b>She sort of fell off the face</b>
<b>of the earth for a while.</b>

08:58.939 --> 09:00.407
<b>I thought</b>
<b>she just grew a beard,</b>

09:00.440 --> 09:01.808
<b>ran into the woods,</b>

09:01.842 --> 09:04.511
<b>was sort of just terminally</b>
<b>delightful to the squirrels.</b>

09:04.545 --> 09:06.580
<b>- How do you feel</b>
<b>being back?</b>

09:06.613 --> 09:08.682
<b>- I was super nervous</b>
<b>to come back.</b>

09:08.715 --> 09:10.083
<b>- Wait.</b>
<b>Why were you nervous?</b>

09:10.117 --> 09:11.351
<b>- Because I was so fantastic</b>
<b>the first time,</b>

09:11.385 --> 09:12.886
<b>it was, like,</b>
<b>how do I live up to that?</b>

09:12.920 --> 09:14.054
<b>[all laugh]</b>

09:14.087 --> 09:16.456
<b>- BenDeLaCreme's</b>
<b>a little recycled.</b>

09:16.490 --> 09:17.724
<b>You know, we've seen it.</b>

09:17.758 --> 09:19.560
<b>I mean,</b>
<b>the Miss Congeniality dress?</b>

09:19.593 --> 09:20.761
<b>That [bleep]</b>
<b>is out the door.</b>

09:20.794 --> 09:22.362
<b>That was</b>
<b>how many seasons ago?</b>

09:22.396 --> 09:25.032
<b>Like, don't worry about</b>
<b>trying to be that.</b>

09:25.032 --> 09:26.366
<b>Try to get the crown.</b>

09:28.936 --> 09:29.903
<b>- Uh-oh.</b>

09:29.937 --> 09:32.806
<b>- Round two, bitches.</b>

09:32.840 --> 09:34.241
<b>Ha-ha!</b>

09:34.274 --> 09:36.076
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>[applause]</b>

09:36.109 --> 09:39.346
<b>- I'm Kennedy Davenport</b>
<b>from Season 7.</b>

09:39.379 --> 09:41.882
<b>The dancing diva of Texas</b>
<b>is back, baby,</b>

09:41.915 --> 09:44.618
<b>and I'm dancing my way</b>
<b>to the top.</b>

09:44.651 --> 09:45.719
<b>[pop]</b>

09:45.752 --> 09:49.423
<b>- Newark, LaGuardia,</b>
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

09:51.491 --> 09:53.961
<b>- Aah! Shut up.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

09:54.061 --> 09:58.732
<b>- I've been in this business</b>
<b>for 17 long years.</b>

09:58.765 --> 10:01.602
<b>I don't think</b>
<b>the other girls are ready.</b>

10:01.635 --> 10:02.769
<b>That is a [bleep] opinion.</b>

10:02.803 --> 10:05.038
<b>You either take it</b>
<b>or you don't.</b>

10:05.072 --> 10:07.541
<b>You know what?</b>
<b>I can be an adult</b>

10:07.574 --> 10:10.210
<b>and say that I may have been</b>
<b>a little bitchy sometimes,</b>

10:10.244 --> 10:12.379
<b>but since the season,</b>
<b>things have changed.</b>

10:12.412 --> 10:14.748
<b>I've grown.</b>
<b>Where are my sisters at?</b>

10:14.781 --> 10:17.451
<b>[cheering]</b>

10:17.484 --> 10:18.719
<b>- Yes!</b>

10:18.752 --> 10:21.321
<b>Kennedy Davenport.</b>

10:21.355 --> 10:22.923
<b>Male bitch.</b>
<b>- Hey!</b>

10:22.956 --> 10:26.159
<b>- We have developed kind of</b>
<b>a mother/daughter relationship.</b>

10:26.193 --> 10:30.030
<b>I get compared to Kennedy</b>
<b>all the time.</b>

10:30.063 --> 10:31.598
<b>- You better come through,</b>
<b>Whoville.</b>

10:31.632 --> 10:35.702
<b>- Oh, my God, the look</b>
<b>is white noise of ugly.</b>

10:35.736 --> 10:37.171
<b>In fact, it's very Chi Chi.</b>

10:37.204 --> 10:39.606
<b>I think Kennedy</b>
<b>is Chi Chi from the future</b>

10:39.640 --> 10:42.142
<b>coming back to tell her</b>
<b>she's not gonna win "All Stars."</b>

10:42.176 --> 10:44.711
<b>Bitch,</b>
<b>they are the same person.</b>

10:44.745 --> 10:46.713
<b>- What's going on,</b>
<b>everybody?</b>

10:46.747 --> 10:48.048
<b>- I'm sorry, I am just staring</b>
<b>at my reflection.</b>

10:48.081 --> 10:49.283
<b>- So many mirrors.</b>
<b>- I know.</b>

10:49.316 --> 10:50.751
<b>- So vain.</b>

10:50.784 --> 10:52.786
<b>- Don't get too blind,</b>
<b>honey. [laughs]</b>

10:52.819 --> 10:54.388
<b>[doorbell rings]</b>

10:57.491 --> 10:59.793
<b>- Well, halle-who</b>
<b>could this be?</b>

11:01.428 --> 11:04.831
<b>- It looks like the box</b>
<b>got an upgrade and so did I.</b>

11:04.865 --> 11:07.234
<b>Halleloo, I'm back, bitches.</b>

11:07.267 --> 11:09.636
<b>Again. Hey!</b>

11:09.670 --> 11:10.804
<b>I'm Shangela.</b>

11:10.838 --> 11:12.139
<b>Baby,</b>
<b>I'm a double kind of ho.</b>

11:12.172 --> 11:15.075
<b>I was on Season 2 and 3.</b>

11:15.108 --> 11:17.611
<b>You know what they say:</b>
<b>third time's the charm.</b>

11:17.644 --> 11:19.079
<b>Halleloo.</b>
<b>Halleloo.</b>

11:19.112 --> 11:20.747
<b>Halleloo, ladies.</b>

11:20.781 --> 11:23.317
<b>He's so gay,</b>
<b>and he's so good.</b>

11:23.350 --> 11:25.719
<b>They always say," LaQuifa,"</b>
<b>I say, "What?"</b>

11:25.752 --> 11:27.554
<b>- You have</b>
<b>an irrepressible energy,</b>

11:27.588 --> 11:33.627
<b>but can energy make up</b>
<b>for a lack of experience?</b>

11:33.660 --> 11:36.230
<b>- I think the biggest</b>
<b>misconception about my drag</b>

11:36.263 --> 11:38.298
<b>was that</b>
<b>I wasn't trying hard.</b>

11:38.332 --> 11:41.101
<b>And I swear, girl, y'all,</b>
<b>I was trying my hardest,</b>

11:41.101 --> 11:42.569
<b>but come to find out,</b>

11:42.603 --> 11:44.137
<b>you actually</b>
<b>do need to know something</b>

11:44.171 --> 11:45.639
<b>about makeup and hair</b>
<b>and costumes</b>

11:45.672 --> 11:48.408
<b>in order to be a full,</b>
<b>well-rounded queen.</b>

11:48.442 --> 11:49.610
<b>Oh.</b>

11:49.643 --> 11:51.278
<b>What's up, bitches?</b>

11:51.311 --> 11:53.914
<b>[cheering]</b>
<b>Halleloo to you.</b>

<b>I cannot stand it.</b>

12:00.487 --> 12:01.788
<b>She's a halle-lunatic.</b>

12:01.822 --> 12:03.257
<b>- Season 2's in the house.</b>

12:03.290 --> 12:04.925
<b>I was there, too, one day,</b>
<b>but I was there.</b>

12:04.958 --> 12:06.527
<b>- Very briefly.</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

12:06.560 --> 12:08.061

<b>- 47th?</b>
<b>- Well, 47th.</b>

<b>Since Season 3, y'all know</b>
<b>I've stepped it into high gear</b>

12:15.402 --> 12:17.404
<b>and became</b>
<b>a true professional.</b>

12:17.437 --> 12:19.773
<b>I've worked in television.</b>
<b>I've worked in film.</b>

12:19.806 --> 12:21.808
<b>I have been able to headline</b>
<b>my own show</b>

<b>on the Las Vegas strip.</b>

<b>- What the [bleep] is it?</b>

12:41.295 --> 12:42.996
<b>- No, it can't be.</b>

12:43.096 --> 12:45.933
<b>- She done</b>

<b>- But 2009</b>
<b>was a very different time.</b>

15:18.731 --> 15:22.034
<b>BeBe had to deal</b>

<b>Remember that?</b>

15:23.602 --> 15:27.606
<b>The grand prize</b>

<b>I'm competing</b>

<b>"All Star" rules</b>
<b>are in full effect.</b>

<b>Each week the top two queens</b>

<b>The winner will receive</b>
<b>a $10,000 tip,</b>

<b>plus the power to eliminate</b>

<b>You don't have the opportunity</b>
<b>to save yourself.</b>

16:36.375 --> 16:37.877
<b>You rely on other people.</b>

16:37.910 --> 16:40.946
<b>So there's no space</b>
<b>for mistake. None.</b>

16:40.980 --> 16:44.984
<b>- Keep your friends close</b>
<b>and your enemies even closer.</b>

16:45.017 --> 16:48.020
<b>Because when it comes</b>
<b>to "All Stars,"</b>

16:48.054 --> 16:50.656
<b>it do get shady up in here,</b>
<b>am I right?</b>

16:50.690 --> 16:51.991
<b>- Hello.</b>

16:52.024 --> 16:54.894
<b>- Now let's take a moment</b>
<b>to get reacquainted.</b>

16:54.927 --> 16:56.595
<b>Oh, pit crew.</b>

16:56.629 --> 16:59.098
<b>- Oh!</b>
<b>- Hey!</b>

16:59.131 --> 17:04.136
<b>- That's right, ladies,</b>
<b>the library is open,</b>

17:04.236 --> 17:06.072
<b>because reading is what?</b>

17:06.105 --> 17:08.240
<b>[All] Fundamental.</b>

17:08.274 --> 17:11.277
<b>- I can't wait to see</b>
<b>how this turns out.</b>

17:11.310 --> 17:15.147
<b>First up, Thorgy Thor,</b>
<b>come on down.</b>

17:15.247 --> 17:16.415
<b>- Whoo!</b>

17:16.449 --> 17:18.617
<b>- Wait. Do you know</b>
<b>where my wallet is?</b>

17:18.651 --> 17:20.219
<b>- What?</b>
<b>- Chi Chi, didn't you take it</b>

17:20.252 --> 17:22.188
<b>when you stole my spot</b>
<b>in the top five of Season 8?</b>

17:22.188 --> 17:24.657
<b>- Ooh.</b>
<b>- Ooh.</b>

17:24.690 --> 17:26.492
<b>- Shangela is the most annoying</b>
<b>thing I've ever met in my life.</b>

17:26.525 --> 17:28.761
<b>She's like a pull-up toy</b>
<b>that says Halleloo,</b>

17:28.794 --> 17:30.096
<b>but the only thing</b>
<b>more annoying than Shangela</b>

17:30.196 --> 17:31.664
<b>is Bob the Drag Queen.</b>

17:31.697 --> 17:33.632
<b>- Oh.</b>

17:33.666 --> 17:34.934
<b>- Just my opinion.</b>

17:34.967 --> 17:36.936
<b>- By the way, Ru,</b>
<b>do you know me and Aja</b>

17:36.969 --> 17:38.204
<b>used to work together</b>
<b>in Brooklyn?</b>

17:38.204 --> 17:39.305
<b>- No, I didn't know that.</b>

17:39.338 --> 17:41.007
<b>- Do you know</b>
<b>she's a straight-up witch?</b>

17:41.040 --> 17:42.308
<b>She cast a spell</b>
<b>on the producers.</b>

17:42.341 --> 17:43.809
<b>How else do you think</b>
<b>she ended up on "All Stars?"</b>

17:43.843 --> 17:45.745
<b>- Oh!</b>
<b>- Oh!</b>

17:45.778 --> 17:47.813
<b>- Miss Thorgy Thor.</b>

17:47.847 --> 17:49.515
<b>Girl, what the [bleep]</b>
<b>you got on your head?</b>

17:49.548 --> 17:50.883
<b>[all laugh]</b>

17:50.916 --> 17:52.351
<b>- Christmas with the Kranks,</b>
<b>honey.</b>

17:52.385 --> 17:54.286
<b>[all laugh]</b>

17:54.320 --> 17:56.355
<b>- Big and milky,</b>

17:56.389 --> 17:58.591
<b>girl, just like the drink,</b>
<b>you give me the [bleep].</b>

17:58.624 --> 18:00.059
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:00.092 --> 18:01.293
<b>- Me, too.</b>

18:01.327 --> 18:04.230
<b>- Aja, welcome</b>
<b>to the big leagues,</b>

18:04.263 --> 18:06.799
<b>where Charlotte Russe</b>
<b>and Forever 21</b>

18:06.832 --> 18:08.401
<b>won't cut it, little girl.</b>

18:08.434 --> 18:10.503
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:10.536 --> 18:13.239
<b>- BenDeLaCreme,</b>
<b>where you been?</b>

18:13.239 --> 18:15.374
<b>- Ooh.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

18:15.408 --> 18:16.676
<b>- Like, literally,</b>
<b>where you been?</b>

18:16.709 --> 18:18.244
<b>- Oh, Seattle.</b>

18:18.244 --> 18:19.445
<b>- [laughs]</b>

18:19.478 --> 18:21.580
<b>- It's okay.</b>
<b>I'm gonna Sia this bitch.</b>

18:21.614 --> 18:23.849
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:23.883 --> 18:26.485
<b>Kennedy Davenport,</b>

18:26.519 --> 18:29.255
<b>the only queen</b>
<b>that doesn't have to turn</b>

18:29.288 --> 18:31.991
<b>to look both ways</b>
<b>before crossing the street.</b>

18:32.024 --> 18:34.093
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:34.193 --> 18:35.361
<b>- I hate you.</b>

18:35.394 --> 18:39.198
<b>- Shangela. I always thought</b>
<b>her name was Angela,</b>

18:39.198 --> 18:41.634
<b>and people were just</b>
<b>telling her to shut up.</b>

18:41.667 --> 18:45.204
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:45.204 --> 18:48.040
<b>- Chi Chi DeVayne,</b>
<b>girl, with that mouth,</b>

18:48.074 --> 18:50.009
<b>you could've put Black & Decker</b>
<b>out of business, bitch,</b>

18:50.042 --> 18:51.744
<b>'cause you a mouthful</b>
<b>of tools, honey.</b>

18:51.777 --> 18:53.813
<b>[all laugh]</b>

18:53.846 --> 18:54.880
<b>- Kennedy Davenport.</b>

18:54.914 --> 18:56.515
<b>- Be gentle, sister.</b>

18:56.549 --> 18:58.617
<b>- You seem a little offended</b>
<b>by our little jokes.</b>

18:58.651 --> 19:01.220
<b>We weren't offended</b>
<b>by your parents' little joke.</b>

19:01.220 --> 19:04.023
<b>- Aah</b>
<b>- Ooh!</b>

19:04.056 --> 19:06.025
<b>- Thorgy Thor,</b>
<b>you know, I love clowns.</b>

19:06.058 --> 19:07.393
<b>- Uh-huh.</b>

19:07.426 --> 19:09.628
<b>- And I never met an unfunny one</b>
<b>till I heard you read it.</b>

19:09.662 --> 19:11.097
<b>- Oh!</b>

19:11.130 --> 19:12.431
<b>- The low-rent</b>
<b>Michelle Visage,</b>

19:12.465 --> 19:14.133
<b>sister,</b>
<b>it's nice to see you here.</b>

19:14.233 --> 19:15.468
<b>It's nice</b>
<b>to see you anywhere</b>

19:15.501 --> 19:17.436
<b>considering you've been</b>
<b>unemployed since Season 6.</b>

19:17.470 --> 19:18.571
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:18.604 --> 19:21.273
<b>Morgan McMichaels,</b>
<b>sister, I know</b>

19:21.307 --> 19:23.476
<b>you love to perform</b>
<b>hard rock music,</b>

19:23.509 --> 19:26.012
<b>and that's good because</b>
<b>that face is also a hard rock.</b>

19:26.045 --> 19:28.214
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:28.247 --> 19:29.749
<b>- Aja.</b>
<b>- Oh.</b>

19:29.782 --> 19:31.317
<b>- You're beautiful,</b>
<b>you're gorgeous,</b>

19:31.350 --> 19:32.385
<b>you look like Seal.</b>

19:32.418 --> 19:36.022
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:36.055 --> 19:37.590
<b>Wow, Milk, you put a lot</b>
<b>into this look.</b>

19:37.623 --> 19:40.192
<b>What, 2%?</b>

19:40.192 --> 19:43.062
<b>Shangela.</b>
<b>- Hey!</b>

19:43.095 --> 19:44.697
<b>- What if this season</b>
<b>we put you in a box?</b>

19:44.730 --> 19:46.666
<b>'Cause you're gonna</b>
<b>halle-lose.</b>

19:46.699 --> 19:49.068
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:49.101 --> 19:50.903
<b>- BeBe Zahara Benet,</b>

19:50.936 --> 19:52.872
<b>you look like</b>
<b>an overweight Naomi Campbell.</b>

19:52.905 --> 19:55.007
<b>- Aah!</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

19:55.041 --> 19:57.710
<b>- Morgan McMichaels, I would</b>
<b>take the A out of your name</b>

19:57.743 --> 19:58.978
<b>and replace it with an O</b>

19:59.011 --> 20:00.880
<b>because I'm pretty sure</b>
<b>we'd like you Mor-gone.</b>

20:00.913 --> 20:02.815
<b>- [gasps]</b>
<b>- What?</b>

20:02.848 --> 20:05.685
<b>- Trixie, you look like</b>
<b>a Lisa Frank serial killer.</b>

20:05.718 --> 20:07.486
<b>- I will take that.</b>

20:07.520 --> 20:08.721
<b>I'm from Wisconsin.</b>

20:08.754 --> 20:11.457
<b>- It's an esthetic.</b>
<b>- Oh, Lord.</b>

20:11.490 --> 20:14.460
<b>- Well, I'm very excited</b>
<b>to read all of my sisters.</b>

20:14.493 --> 20:17.063
<b>Oh, Thorgy,</b>
<b>I love this full outfit.</b>

20:17.096 --> 20:19.031
<b>I usually only get to see</b>
<b>about this much</b>

20:19.065 --> 20:20.933
<b>when you're handing out balloons</b>
<b>from that sewer grate.</b>

20:20.966 --> 20:22.902
<b>[all laugh]</b>
<b>- Oh, my God.</b>

20:22.935 --> 20:27.173
<b>- Shangela,</b>
<b>you have come so far.</b>

20:27.173 --> 20:29.241
<b>Initially your makeup</b>
<b>was kind of busted</b>

20:29.275 --> 20:30.743
<b>and your outfits</b>
<b>were a mess</b>

20:30.776 --> 20:32.545
<b>and your personality</b>
<b>was super grating,</b>

20:32.578 --> 20:34.447
<b>but look at how far</b>
<b>you've come now.</b>

20:34.480 --> 20:35.781
<b>You are much older.</b>

20:35.815 --> 20:37.817
<b>[all laugh]</b>

20:37.850 --> 20:41.253
<b>Trixie, you know, a lot</b>
<b>of people clock your makeup,</b>

20:41.287 --> 20:42.989
<b>but I totally get it.</b>

20:43.022 --> 20:45.024
<b>You know, you're just painting</b>
<b>for the back of the room,</b>

20:45.057 --> 20:47.994
<b>which makes sense because that's</b>
<b>where your audience collects</b>

20:48.027 --> 20:49.528
<b>if you remember</b>
<b>to lock the door.</b>

20:49.562 --> 20:51.030
<b>[all laugh]</b>

20:51.063 --> 20:54.300
<b>- And, BeBe, I hear</b>
<b>that this is the year</b>

20:54.333 --> 20:56.335
<b>that you might</b>
<b>get two crowns,</b>

20:56.369 --> 20:58.671
<b>which is really not</b>
<b>a lot of dental work</b>

20:58.704 --> 21:01.007
<b>as far as those early seasons</b>
<b>are concerned.</b>

21:01.040 --> 21:03.275
<b>[all laugh]</b>

21:03.309 --> 21:04.710
<b>- Thanks, Mother.</b>

21:04.744 --> 21:06.512
<b>[clears throat]</b>

21:06.545 --> 21:08.614
<b>Thorgy Thor.</b>

21:08.648 --> 21:11.317
<b>Mother, she looks homeless.</b>

21:11.350 --> 21:14.020
<b>You know, I'm not gonna read</b>
<b>Morgan McMichaels.</b>

21:14.053 --> 21:16.322
<b>Life already has.</b>

21:16.355 --> 21:20.526
<b>Everybody,</b>
<b>I'm the only African here,</b>

21:20.559 --> 21:22.728
<b>but why it does look like</b>
<b>with Kennedy Davenport</b>

21:22.762 --> 21:25.297
<b>you can sponsor her</b>
<b>for 30 cents a day?</b>

21:25.331 --> 21:28.167
<b>[all laugh]</b>

21:28.200 --> 21:30.169
<b>- Ooh, somebody burned out</b>
<b>a light.</b>

21:30.169 --> 21:31.404
<b>It's shady in here.</b>

21:31.437 --> 21:33.506
<b>- [laughs]</b>

21:33.539 --> 21:35.741
<b>- The library</b>
<b>is closed officially.</b>

21:35.775 --> 21:37.276
<b>- Thank you.</b>

21:37.310 --> 21:41.047
<b>- The winner of today's</b>
<b>mini challenge is...</b>

21:41.080 --> 21:42.415
<b>BenDeLaCreme.</b>

21:42.448 --> 21:44.550
<b>[cheers and applause]</b>

21:44.583 --> 21:47.720
<b>You've won</b>
<b>a $3,000 gift certificate</b>

21:47.753 --> 21:50.256
<b>from l.a. Eyeworks.</b>
<b>- Oh.</b>

21:50.289 --> 21:53.626
<b>- So Miss Congeniality</b>
<b>won the reading challenge.</b>

21:53.659 --> 21:56.195
<b>Some of the queens</b>
<b>are underestimating</b>

21:56.195 --> 21:57.463
<b>what I'm bringing</b>
<b>to this competition,</b>

21:57.496 --> 21:59.965
<b>and I'm gonna</b>
<b>prove them wrong.</b>

21:59.999 --> 22:04.770
<b>- And I will be posting more</b>
<b>of your reads at VH1.com.</b>

22:04.804 --> 22:07.306
<b>All right. Ladies,</b>
<b>it's time to get ready</b>

22:07.340 --> 22:09.709
<b>for your big comeback</b>
<b>to the main stage.</b>

22:09.742 --> 22:11.811
<b>For this week's</b>
<b>maxi challenge,</b>

22:11.844 --> 22:15.047
<b>you'll be headlining</b>
<b>an All Star Variety Show.</b>

22:15.081 --> 22:17.717
<b>- Whoo!</b>
<b>- Yeah!</b>

22:17.750 --> 22:20.820
<b>- Tomorrow, in front of</b>
<b>a live studio audience,</b>

22:20.853 --> 22:23.222
<b>you need to show that</b>
<b>your charisma, uniqueness,</b>

22:23.255 --> 22:28.394
<b>nerve and talent, is bigger,</b>
<b>fresher, and better than ever.</b>

22:28.427 --> 22:30.262
<b>#AllStars3.</b>

22:30.296 --> 22:33.199
<b>Gentlemen,</b>
<b>start your engines,</b>

22:33.232 --> 22:36.202
<b>and may the best</b>
<b>All Star win.</b>

22:36.235 --> 22:38.170
<b>[cheers and applause]</b>

22:39.372 --> 22:42.041
<b>- I need to get</b>
<b>the [bleep] outta drag.</b>

22:42.074 --> 22:44.577
<b>- This was Pearl's spot,</b>
<b>and she skated by,</b>

22:44.610 --> 22:48.180
<b>so I'm looking to inherit</b>
<b>that energy.</b>

22:48.180 --> 22:50.016
<b>- [laughs]</b>
<b>Bitch, you got jokes.</b>

22:50.049 --> 22:52.618
<b>- Guys, BeBe's back.</b>
<b>- Mother.</b>

22:52.652 --> 22:53.786
<b>- Winner, winner</b>
<b>chicken dinner.</b>

22:53.819 --> 22:57.023
<b>More great things</b>
<b>are happening for you.</b>

22:57.056 --> 22:59.191
<b>- Do you think you have a good</b>
<b>chance of winning this season?</b>

22:59.191 --> 23:01.193
<b>- Everybody's competition,</b>
<b>but I'm here</b>

23:01.193 --> 23:03.229
<b>to really, really</b>
<b>get to share my gifts,</b>

23:03.262 --> 23:04.363
<b>and also</b>
<b>to be able to learn</b>

23:04.397 --> 23:06.198
<b>from the all other girls</b>
<b>I have not worked with,</b>

23:06.198 --> 23:08.901
<b>because everybody</b>
<b>has something special.</b>

23:08.934 --> 23:11.203
<b>That sounds like</b>
<b>an Oprah moment, but it's true.</b>

23:11.203 --> 23:13.239
<b>- BeBe's never really</b>
<b>experienced a hardship</b>

23:13.272 --> 23:14.473
<b>on "Drag Race."</b>

23:14.507 --> 23:16.409
<b>She hasn't had a bad moment.</b>

23:16.442 --> 23:17.610
<b>It's actually scary</b>
<b>to be her.</b>

23:17.643 --> 23:20.146
<b>- If you have a good experience</b>
<b>on "Drag Race,"</b>

23:20.146 --> 23:23.049
<b>it's like so terrifying</b>
<b>to come back.</b>

23:23.149 --> 23:24.283
<b>- Oh, there's more to lose.</b>

23:24.317 --> 23:26.052
<b>- Absolutely.</b>
<b>And I have to say</b>

23:26.152 --> 23:28.187
<b>that I really thought</b>
<b>Valentina was gonna be here.</b>

23:28.220 --> 23:30.256
<b>- Me, too.</b>
<b>- And I am disappointed,</b>

23:30.289 --> 23:34.160
<b>because I am now like</b>
<b>the Miss Congeniality</b>

23:34.193 --> 23:35.895
<b>who, like,</b>
<b>if I'm like a bitch,</b>

23:35.928 --> 23:37.730
<b>that's gonna look terrible.</b>

23:37.763 --> 23:39.332
<b>But if Valentina was here,</b>
<b>she's just like already</b>

23:39.365 --> 23:41.734
<b>automatically the worst</b>
<b>about that.</b>

23:41.767 --> 23:43.235
<b>- I like Ben.</b>

23:43.269 --> 23:46.405
<b>I just think</b>
<b>she can come across</b>

23:46.439 --> 23:49.442
<b>as trying to be congenial,</b>

23:49.475 --> 23:52.578
<b>but I don't think that</b>
<b>that's actually who she is.</b>

23:52.611 --> 23:55.181
<b>I think</b>
<b>she will be congenial</b>

23:55.214 --> 23:56.816
<b>to get</b>
<b>exactly what she wants.</b>

24:02.288 --> 24:05.624
<b>- Trixie, are you making</b>
<b>a porno for your talent?</b>

24:05.658 --> 24:07.760
<b>- No, I'm gonna play violin</b>
<b>in a red clown wig.</b>

24:07.793 --> 24:09.895
<b>It's kind of my thing.</b>
<b>- Very funny.</b>

24:09.929 --> 24:12.231
<b>The first challenge</b>
<b>is very, very important</b>

24:12.264 --> 24:13.366
<b>because in "All Stars,"</b>

24:13.399 --> 24:15.935
<b>it's about impressing</b>
<b>your competition,</b>

24:15.968 --> 24:18.237
<b>so you really have to come out</b>
<b>as a front runner right away.</b>

24:18.270 --> 24:19.672
<b>- What are you doing</b>
<b>for talent?</b>

24:19.705 --> 24:21.707
<b>- I'm drag dancing it out.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>

24:23.209 --> 24:24.610
<b>- Come through.</b>

24:24.644 --> 24:26.178
<b>- I've never done it</b>
<b>before, so...</b>

24:26.212 --> 24:27.179
<b>- Very good.</b>
<b>- And what are you doing?</b>

24:27.213 --> 24:28.648
<b>- Just one of my songs.</b>

24:28.681 --> 24:30.016
<b>- She's also</b>
<b>performing a song.</b>

24:30.049 --> 24:33.552
<b>- A lot of the queens are doing</b>
<b>basically the same thing,</b>

24:33.586 --> 24:35.888
<b>lip syncing or dancing</b>

24:35.921 --> 24:37.957
<b>or singing</b>
<b>one of their original songs.</b>

24:39.258 --> 24:40.693
<b>As long as I do well</b>
<b>with the violin playing</b>

24:40.726 --> 24:43.929
<b>and my strings don't explode,</b>
<b>I'm gonna win. Whoo!</b>

24:43.963 --> 24:48.601
<b>- How do you feel about</b>
<b>the whole elimination setup?</b>

24:48.634 --> 24:50.136
<b>- I like it.</b>
<b>- Do you?</b>

24:50.169 --> 24:51.470
<b>- I'm just gonna</b>
<b>send the bitch home</b>

24:51.504 --> 24:52.938
<b>that I think</b>
<b>is the strongest.</b>

24:52.972 --> 24:54.173
<b>- Really?</b>

24:54.206 --> 24:56.842
<b>- That's exactly</b>
<b>what I'm gonna do.</b>

24:56.876 --> 24:58.411
<b>- That is terrifying.</b>

24:58.444 --> 24:59.979
<b>- Well, the thing is,</b>
<b>I mean, why lie about it?</b>

25:00.012 --> 25:02.915
<b>Like, you know, everybody</b>
<b>played Kumbaya last year,</b>

25:02.948 --> 25:07.420
<b>and it was like, oh, here.</b>
<b>Tch, tch, tch, tch.</b>

25:07.453 --> 25:09.488
<b>We are all friends,</b>
<b>we are all sisters,</b>

25:09.522 --> 25:12.958
<b>but, like, at the end</b>
<b>of the day, $100,000.</b>

25:12.992 --> 25:15.361
<b>My strategy</b>
<b>for sending girls home--</b>

25:15.394 --> 25:17.530
<b>it isn't shady,</b>
<b>it is honest.</b>

25:17.563 --> 25:18.631
<b>This is a game.</b>

25:18.664 --> 25:20.066
<b>You have to play it</b>
<b>to win it,</b>

25:20.099 --> 25:22.802
<b>and I love the girls,</b>
<b>but I want to win.</b>

25:22.835 --> 25:24.403
<b>- I feel like it would be</b>
<b>like career suicide</b>

25:24.437 --> 25:25.705
<b>to look</b>
<b>straight in the camera</b>

25:25.738 --> 25:27.606
<b>and say, that person</b>
<b>is my biggest threat, go home.</b>

25:27.640 --> 25:29.041
<b>- But you don't</b>
<b>just have to deal with,</b>

25:29.075 --> 25:30.242
<b>like, what other people's</b>
<b>response is.</b>

25:30.276 --> 25:31.444
<b>You have to deal with, like,</b>

25:31.477 --> 25:33.446
<b>how you feel about how you won</b>
<b>or didn't win.</b>

25:33.479 --> 25:34.680
<b>- But if you're honest,</b>

25:34.714 --> 25:37.216
<b>then there's no fast one</b>
<b>being pulled.</b>

25:37.216 --> 25:39.852
<b>If you're straight up</b>
<b>from the jump,</b>

25:39.885 --> 25:42.455
<b>then there's no--</b>
<b>there's no mincing of words,</b>

25:42.488 --> 25:43.990
<b>there's no mixup</b>
<b>in your communication.</b>

25:44.023 --> 25:45.224
<b>- It's hard, though,</b>

25:45.224 --> 25:46.993
<b>because it's like a room</b>
<b>full of fan favorites.</b>

25:47.026 --> 25:48.527
<b>- With the exception of me.</b>

25:48.561 --> 25:50.663
<b>- That's true.</b>
<b>- [laughs]</b>

25:50.696 --> 25:51.630
<b>- But it is. I mean--</b>

25:51.664 --> 25:52.732
<b>- No, like the T, yeah.</b>

25:52.765 --> 25:54.800
<b>- Everybody in here</b>
<b>is a fan favorite,</b>

25:54.834 --> 25:57.036
<b>except I'm not worried</b>
<b>about that.</b>

25:57.069 --> 25:58.237
<b>- Morgan is talking about</b>

25:58.237 --> 25:59.572
<b>she's gonna eliminate</b>
<b>the strongest queens</b>

25:59.605 --> 26:00.840
<b>to knock out</b>
<b>the competition.</b>

26:00.873 --> 26:03.242
<b>Sweetie,</b>
<b>that's a great strategy</b>

26:03.242 --> 26:04.577
<b>that you should not</b>
<b>have said out loud</b>

26:04.610 --> 26:06.012
<b>in front of</b>
<b>all these queens.</b>

26:06.045 --> 26:08.247
<b>- Would you say that it's not</b>
<b>"RuPaul's Best Friend Race"?</b>

26:08.247 --> 26:10.049
<b>- Well, LaShauwn said it,</b>
<b>I didn't.</b>

26:11.150 --> 26:12.652
<b>- Coming up...</b>

26:12.685 --> 26:14.520
<b>- Everybody</b>
<b>is getting along.</b>

26:14.553 --> 26:16.856
<b>Oh, I love you,</b>
<b>kissy, kissy, kissy.</b>

26:16.889 --> 26:18.424
<b>But we all know</b>
<b>how this works.</b>

26:18.457 --> 26:20.259
<b>We ain't talking about that,</b>
<b>Miss Thang.</b>

26:20.292 --> 26:22.194
<b>- Okay, God bless you, too.</b>
<b>- Be nice, bitch.</b>

26:22.194 --> 26:24.030
<b>- Girl, bye.</b>

26:24.063 --> 26:26.198
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

26:30.802 --> 26:32.203
<b>- Good morning.</b>

26:32.236 --> 26:33.805
<b>- Zaddy's home.</b>

26:33.838 --> 26:35.506
<b>- Today's maxi challenge</b>

26:35.540 --> 26:38.576
<b>is a "RuPaul's Drag Race All</b>
<b>Stars" Variety Extravaganza.</b>

26:38.609 --> 26:41.479
<b>[pop] My talent is not</b>
<b>tongue popping. Don't worry.</b>

26:41.512 --> 26:43.614
<b>- How's everybody doing?</b>
<b>- How are you doing?</b>

26:43.648 --> 26:46.017
<b>- Of course everybody</b>
<b>is getting along.</b>

26:46.050 --> 26:47.451
<b>Everybody is Kumbaya,</b>

26:47.485 --> 26:49.921
<b>everybody is Mother Teresa,</b>
<b>Gandhi.</b>

26:49.954 --> 26:52.557
<b>Oh, I love you,</b>
<b>kissy, kissy, kissy.</b>

26:52.590 --> 26:54.058
<b>But we all know</b>
<b>how this works.</b>

26:54.091 --> 26:55.993
<b>It will be very interesting</b>

26:56.027 --> 27:00.198
<b>to see if all of this</b>
<b>sisterly love stays.</b>

27:01.933 --> 27:04.702
<b>- Well, I'm just hoping</b>
<b>that I am not in the bottom</b>

27:04.735 --> 27:06.904
<b>because every season</b>
<b>I've been on,</b>

27:06.938 --> 27:08.906
<b>I was in the bottom</b>
<b>on the first episode.</b>

27:08.940 --> 27:11.442
<b>- But one person</b>
<b>has to go home today.</b>

27:11.476 --> 27:13.945
<b>I mean, it's always scary</b>
<b>like the very first elimination.</b>

27:13.978 --> 27:15.313
<b>- [gasps] I'm shook.</b>

27:15.346 --> 27:18.049
<b>- It sucks, but somebody</b>
<b>gotta do it, bitch.</b>

27:18.082 --> 27:20.952
<b>Tonight</b>
<b>is the first elimination,</b>

27:20.985 --> 27:23.554
<b>and it's all up</b>
<b>to the girls.</b>

27:23.588 --> 27:26.057
<b>Right now you just don't know</b>
<b>how it's gonna go.</b>

27:26.090 --> 27:27.859
<b>There's no set guidelines.</b>

27:27.892 --> 27:30.161
<b>And then what if</b>
<b>we set the guidelines</b>

27:30.194 --> 27:33.064
<b>and somebody steps</b>
<b>outside of those guidelines?</b>

27:33.097 --> 27:35.867
<b>It just...</b>
<b>it wrecks my nerves.</b>

27:36.968 --> 27:40.037
<b>- I think that we as a group</b>

27:40.071 --> 27:41.873
<b>have generally gotten along</b>
<b>really, really well so far,</b>

27:41.906 --> 27:44.842
<b>but I think people's true colors</b>
<b>will start to show</b>

27:44.876 --> 27:47.378
<b>the minute the top</b>
<b>and the bottom are announced.</b>

27:47.378 --> 27:49.580
<b>I think the claws</b>
<b>are gonna come out tonight.</b>

27:49.614 --> 27:50.781
<b>- I want the claws</b>
<b>to come out.</b>

27:50.815 --> 27:51.916
<b>- Me, too.</b>
<b>I like the drama.</b>

27:51.949 --> 27:53.217
<b>- I think it'll be so fun.</b>
<b>I love drama.</b>

27:53.251 --> 27:55.286
<b>- I'm always intrigued</b>
<b>because the fans are, like,</b>

27:55.386 --> 27:57.221
<b>oh, you're the nice one,</b>
<b>you're the bitchy one.</b>

27:57.255 --> 27:58.689
<b>I'm, like, baby, you realize</b>

27:58.723 --> 28:00.858
<b>that drag queens</b>
<b>encompass everything, right?</b>

28:00.892 --> 28:04.228
<b>Like, yes, I'm a little more</b>
<b>viper-tongued.</b>

28:06.497 --> 28:07.698
<b>- You're such a meanie,</b>

28:07.732 --> 28:09.634
<b>but I don't think</b>
<b>you are at all.</b>

28:09.667 --> 28:11.102
<b>- Morgan is one of the nicest</b>
<b>people I've ever met.</b>

28:11.135 --> 28:13.104
<b>- I really, like,</b>
<b>love you, Morgan.</b>

28:13.137 --> 28:14.405
<b>- Oh, thanks, babe.</b>

28:14.405 --> 28:15.406
<b>I'm just me.</b>

28:17.175 --> 28:18.943
<b>- Do you know what?</b>
<b>I actually think</b>

28:18.976 --> 28:21.112
<b>"Drag Race"</b>
<b>is more stressful</b>

28:21.145 --> 28:23.881
<b>than any drag experience</b>
<b>I've ever had in the real world.</b>

28:23.915 --> 28:26.350
<b>I think I spent the whole time</b>
<b>the first time on "Drag Race"</b>

28:26.350 --> 28:29.053
<b>saying "I'm not scared,"</b>
<b>even though I was.</b>

28:29.086 --> 28:32.156
<b>- Last time</b>
<b>I got really in my head,</b>

28:32.190 --> 28:34.358
<b>and when I didn't do as well</b>
<b>as I thought I was gonna do,</b>

28:34.392 --> 28:36.460
<b>I thought it was, like,</b>
<b>a reflection of my worth.</b>

28:36.494 --> 28:40.364
<b>And Milk saw me, like, before</b>
<b>the show aired after our season.</b>

28:40.398 --> 28:41.899
<b>- Yeah, she was in a mood.</b>

28:41.933 --> 28:43.367
<b>- I was shook.</b>

28:43.367 --> 28:46.871
<b>When I was eliminated,</b>
<b>I was devastated.</b>

28:46.904 --> 28:51.409
<b>I felt like the air was</b>
<b>being sucked out of my lungs.</b>

28:51.442 --> 28:53.544
<b>But this time around</b>
<b>I'm here to prove</b>

28:53.578 --> 28:56.514
<b>that I can get through</b>
<b>anything that's thrown at me</b>

28:56.547 --> 28:58.049
<b>without getting rattled</b>
<b>by it.</b>

29:01.385 --> 29:04.222
<b>- Who did you gag on coming</b>
<b>into this room, honey?</b>

29:04.255 --> 29:06.457
<b>- Aja, because</b>
<b>she just left the season.</b>

29:06.491 --> 29:07.758
<b>So it was like--</b>

29:07.792 --> 29:09.093
<b>- Are you surprised</b>
<b>to see me?</b>

29:09.126 --> 29:10.127
<b>- Yeah.</b>

29:10.161 --> 29:11.395
<b>- I mean,</b>
<b>you were just so new.</b>

29:11.395 --> 29:13.731
<b>Girl, you just</b>
<b>got off the boat, bitch.</b>

29:13.764 --> 29:16.000
<b>Bitch, you fresh meat,</b>
<b>bitch, so...</b>

29:16.033 --> 29:18.035
<b>- But she just got off</b>
<b>the "Drag Race" boat,</b>

29:18.069 --> 29:20.138
<b>but she's been doing drag</b>
<b>for like six-and-a-half years.</b>

29:20.171 --> 29:21.539
<b>- We're not talking</b>
<b>about that.</b>

29:21.572 --> 29:23.541
<b>- Sister, I'm allowed to put</b>
<b>a little piece in there.</b>

29:23.574 --> 29:25.243
<b>- Oh, girl, but we ain't talking</b>
<b>about that, Miss Thang.</b>

29:25.276 --> 29:26.577
<b>- Okay, God bless you, too.</b>

29:26.611 --> 29:28.012
<b>- Ooh.</b>

29:28.045 --> 29:30.348
<b>- Let me stop, honey.</b>
<b>- Be nice, bitch.</b>

29:30.381 --> 29:32.016
<b>- They're gonna start thinking</b>
<b>I'm mean, girl.</b>

29:32.049 --> 29:34.585
<b>- You still mean, girl.</b>
<b>You're still mean.</b>

29:34.619 --> 29:37.355
<b>- I know the girls</b>
<b>are gonna underestimate me,</b>

29:37.355 --> 29:40.158
<b>and my advice to them</b>
<b>is underestimate me</b>

29:40.191 --> 29:42.527
<b>'cause we'll see</b>
<b>who gets the last laugh.</b>

29:42.560 --> 29:44.262

45:15.822 --> 45:18.292
<b>You raised the bar today,</b>

45:18.325 --> 45:19.826
<b>and then</b>
<b>you jumped off of it.</b>

45:19.860 --> 45:22.296
<b>- Aah!</b>
<b>- You really brought it.</b>

45:22.329 --> 45:23.363
<b>I'm so into vogueing</b>
<b>right now,</b>

45:23.397 --> 45:26.233
<b>so that gave me life,</b>

45:26.266 --> 45:28.602
<b>and that jump,</b>
<b>it was just insane.</b>

45:28.635 --> 45:30.938
<b>- This is what I was waiting for</b>
<b>all of Season 9.</b>

45:30.971 --> 45:32.306
<b>- What's changed?</b>

45:32.339 --> 45:33.707
<b>- I don't give a [bleep]</b>
<b>what anybody thinks about me.</b>

45:33.740 --> 45:36.610
<b>This is me, and if somebody</b>
<b>has a problem with it,</b>

45:36.643 --> 45:39.046
<b>then that's a you problem</b>
<b>and not a me problem.</b>

45:39.079 --> 45:40.981
<b>- That's right.</b>
<b>You just jump on their ass.</b>

45:41.014 --> 45:42.316
<b>[all laugh]</b>

45:42.349 --> 45:44.117
<b>Thank you, Aja.</b>

45:44.151 --> 45:45.552
<b>All right, next up,</b>
<b>BenDeLaCreme.</b>

45:45.586 --> 45:46.587
<b>- Hi.</b>

45:46.620 --> 45:48.021
<b>- You're so beautiful.</b>

45:48.055 --> 45:50.357
<b>- I know, right?</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

45:50.390 --> 45:52.726
<b>- You look stunning</b>
<b>head to toe.</b>

45:52.759 --> 45:55.195
<b>The little fascinator, the</b>
<b>jewelry, the color you chose,</b>

45:55.228 --> 45:57.397
<b>and then you give us comedy</b>

45:57.431 --> 45:59.800
<b>when you did the Ukrainian</b>
<b>nesting dolls of bras</b>

45:59.833 --> 46:01.668
<b>that kept coming.</b>

46:01.702 --> 46:03.203
<b>I was waiting</b>
<b>for one of Gorbachev.</b>

46:03.236 --> 46:05.138
<b>- I think</b>
<b>you're just the tits.</b>

46:05.172 --> 46:06.607
<b>I do.</b>

46:06.640 --> 46:08.108
<b>You know, there are</b>
<b>certain queens come up here</b>

46:08.141 --> 46:09.910
<b>and you go, I cannot wait</b>
<b>to see what they do.</b>

46:09.943 --> 46:12.179
<b>You're one of them.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

46:12.212 --> 46:13.480
<b>Tch, tch.</b>

46:13.513 --> 46:15.282
<b>- Up next, Chi Chi DeVayne.</b>

46:15.315 --> 46:16.550
<b>- Hey, y'all.</b>

46:16.583 --> 46:18.719
<b>- You look beautiful.</b>
<b>Your face looks beautiful,</b>

46:18.819 --> 46:22.256
<b>but all I kept doing</b>
<b>was looking at the shoes.</b>

46:22.289 --> 46:25.225
<b>You have to have</b>
<b>some kind of a heel,</b>

46:25.259 --> 46:28.028
<b>because it immediately</b>
<b>crunches you.</b>

46:28.061 --> 46:30.163
<b>- I have to agree</b>
<b>with Michelle.</b>

46:30.197 --> 46:31.431
<b>Those shoes were killing me.</b>

46:31.465 --> 46:33.367
<b>I know you have to have</b>
<b>a certain kind of shoe</b>

46:33.400 --> 46:34.668
<b>to do what you were doing.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

46:34.701 --> 46:36.069
<b>- But I've seen</b>
<b>you do acrobatics.</b>

46:36.103 --> 46:37.471
<b>- In heels.</b>
<b>- Yeah, girl.</b>

46:37.504 --> 46:40.207
<b>- And I could've just easily</b>
<b>just put on a six-inch heel</b>

46:40.240 --> 46:41.842
<b>and still</b>
<b>worked something out.</b>

46:41.842 --> 46:43.210
<b>It was just a bad decision.</b>

46:43.243 --> 46:45.245
<b>- I was not in love</b>
<b>with the hair.</b>

46:45.279 --> 46:46.947
<b>I felt like</b>
<b>it was getting in the way</b>

46:46.980 --> 46:49.182
<b>of the performance a lot.</b>
<b>- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</b>

46:49.216 --> 46:50.217
<b>- I think</b>
<b>for the performance,</b>

46:50.250 --> 46:51.551
<b>you gotta amp it up</b>
<b>a little bit.</b>

46:51.585 --> 46:53.353
<b>- It was almost like</b>
<b>down here</b>

46:53.387 --> 46:54.955
<b>when the rest of the girls</b>
<b>were taking it up there.</b>

46:54.988 --> 46:57.224
<b>And I know that</b>
<b>you have what it takes,</b>

46:57.257 --> 47:00.327
<b>so I want you</b>
<b>to push it there.</b>

47:00.360 --> 47:03.263
<b>- Up next,</b>
<b>Morgan McMichaels.</b>

47:03.297 --> 47:06.333
<b>- Finally I get to get judged by</b>
<b>the notorious Michelle Visage.</b>

47:06.366 --> 47:08.802
<b>- Notorious, yes, darling.</b>

47:08.802 --> 47:10.170
<b>You look amazing.</b>

47:10.203 --> 47:12.706
<b>Out of the four</b>
<b>spangled bodysuits,</b>

47:12.806 --> 47:14.841
<b>yours is above and beyond</b>
<b>my favorite.</b>

47:14.875 --> 47:17.978
<b>- I mean, the shoulder details,</b>
<b>all of the embellishment,</b>

47:18.011 --> 47:20.147
<b>the colors, the iridescence.</b>

47:20.180 --> 47:21.848
<b>Really well done.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

47:21.882 --> 47:23.317
<b>- But when</b>
<b>you were performing,</b>

47:23.350 --> 47:25.085
<b>I felt like your nerves got</b>
<b>a little bit too good of you.</b>

47:25.118 --> 47:26.820
<b>Because I found you</b>

47:26.853 --> 47:29.823
<b>almost doing the entire thing</b>
<b>over to the girls.</b>

47:29.823 --> 47:31.825
<b>- Um, I had never recorded</b>
<b>a track before,</b>

47:31.825 --> 47:33.660
<b>so I was [bleep] it</b>
<b>a little.</b>

47:33.694 --> 47:35.395
<b>- I get to see you</b>
<b>in Palm Springs all the time,</b>

47:35.429 --> 47:39.700
<b>and nobody owns a room</b>
<b>like Morgan McMichaels.</b>

47:39.733 --> 47:41.835
<b>It's like everybody</b>
<b>in the club disappears</b>

47:41.835 --> 47:44.338
<b>and I see is you because</b>
<b>you're in charge of me.</b>

47:44.371 --> 47:46.540
<b>- I charge for that.</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

47:46.573 --> 47:48.742
<b>- So any self doubt,</b>
<b>knock it off,</b>

47:48.842 --> 47:51.244
<b>because anything less than 100</b>
<b>is not good enough.</b>

47:51.278 --> 47:53.714
<b>- You heard it here.</b>
<b>Don't take less than 100.</b>

47:53.747 --> 47:57.451
<b>[all laugh]</b>

47:59.086 --> 48:00.254
<b>Thank you, ladies.</b>

48:00.287 --> 48:02.789
<b>Based on</b>
<b>the judges' critiques,</b>

48:02.789 --> 48:04.791
<b>I've made some decisions.</b>

48:06.793 --> 48:08.795
<b>Aja,</b>

48:08.795 --> 48:10.364
<b>BenDeLaCreme...</b>

48:12.666 --> 48:15.135
<b>You are the top two All Stars</b>
<b>of the week.</b>

48:15.168 --> 48:17.671
<b>Con-drag-ulations.</b>

48:17.704 --> 48:21.875
<b>You've each won airfare</b>
<b>and a five-night stay</b>

48:21.908 --> 48:26.313
<b>at the Grand Resort Hotel</b>
<b>and Spa in Fort Lauderdale.</b>

48:26.346 --> 48:28.048
<b>Clothing optional.</b>

48:28.081 --> 48:30.484
<b>- Perfect.</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

48:30.517 --> 48:32.686
<b>- Shangela,</b>

48:32.719 --> 48:33.820
<b>Thorgy Thor...</b>

48:35.255 --> 48:37.658
<b>You are safe.</b>

48:37.691 --> 48:42.195
<b>That means Chi Chi DeVayne</b>
<b>and Morgan McMichaels,</b>

48:42.229 --> 48:44.631
<b>you are in the bottom two.</b>

48:44.665 --> 48:45.732
<b>- Oh,[bleep]</b>

48:45.832 --> 48:47.668
<b>First episode,</b>
<b>in the bottom.</b>

48:47.701 --> 48:51.038
<b>I've worked so hard</b>
<b>to be here on "All Stars,"</b>

48:51.071 --> 48:53.273
<b>and I do not want to go home,</b>
<b>like, at all.</b>

48:53.307 --> 48:55.542
<b>Like...</b>

48:55.575 --> 48:57.544
<b>Oh, God.</b>

48:57.577 --> 48:59.947
<b>- Aja and BenDeLaCreme,</b>

48:59.980 --> 49:02.416
<b>each of you needs to decide</b>

49:02.449 --> 49:06.253
<b>which of the bottom two</b>
<b>you will eliminate</b>

49:06.286 --> 49:08.855
<b>if you win the lip sync.</b>

49:08.889 --> 49:12.793
<b>So while you queens</b>
<b>deliberate in the workroom,</b>

49:12.793 --> 49:17.064
<b>the judges and I will watch</b>
<b>Vanessa and Pork Chop</b>

49:17.097 --> 49:18.899
<b>lip sync for their lives.</b>

49:18.932 --> 49:20.968
<b>[all laugh]</b>

49:21.001 --> 49:22.336
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

49:22.369 --> 49:24.171
<b>Coming up...</b>

49:24.204 --> 49:26.540
<b>- I really wish you would</b>
<b>have gave Morgan--</b>

49:26.573 --> 49:28.408
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Like 1,000%.</b>

49:28.442 --> 49:29.876
<b>I'm about</b>
<b>to ruin somebody life.</b>

49:29.910 --> 49:31.545
<b>- I know that you're capable</b>
<b>of stronger work</b>

49:31.578 --> 49:32.579
<b>than you did tonight.</b>

49:32.613 --> 49:35.682
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- But sometimes you're done.</b>

49:35.716 --> 49:37.718
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

49:40.786 --> 49:43.288
<b>- Whew.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>

49:43.322 --> 49:44.556
<b>- This is "All Stars."</b>

49:44.590 --> 49:47.559
<b>The lip sync for your legacy</b>
<b>rules are in effect,</b>

49:47.593 --> 49:50.496
<b>and we have to eliminate</b>
<b>one of these queens already,</b>

49:50.529 --> 49:53.699
<b>and I don't think anyone's</b>
<b>really ready for it.</b>

49:53.732 --> 49:55.467
<b>- Well, first,</b>
<b>congratulations.</b>

49:55.501 --> 49:56.802
<b>- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Congratulations.</b>

49:56.835 --> 49:58.570
<b>- Cheers, top two.</b>

49:58.604 --> 50:00.906
<b>- It feels insane because</b>
<b>I never was even in the top.</b>

50:00.939 --> 50:03.776
<b>In my season, like,</b>
<b>I never went past safe.</b>

50:03.809 --> 50:05.177
<b>- You're only gonna get it once,</b>
<b>so enjoy it.</b>

50:05.210 --> 50:06.445
<b>- [bleep] off.</b>
<b>[laughs]</b>

50:06.478 --> 50:08.680
<b>- You're in a horrible position</b>
<b>right now, you guys.</b>

50:08.714 --> 50:09.848
<b>- I mean,</b>
<b>it's not great, right?</b>

50:09.882 --> 50:12.985
<b>Like, this is the worst</b>
<b>double-edged sword.</b>

50:13.018 --> 50:15.854
<b>It is really exciting</b>
<b>to win this challenge.</b>

50:15.888 --> 50:19.658
<b>However,</b>
<b>I wanna judge fairly,</b>

50:19.691 --> 50:22.828
<b>and playing fair</b>
<b>does not involve eliminations</b>

50:22.861 --> 50:25.230
<b>that you think are just</b>
<b>gonna help you personally.</b>

50:25.264 --> 50:28.567
<b>This sucks.</b>
<b>- You have to pick somebody.</b>

50:28.600 --> 50:30.569
<b>- We have to because it's like</b>
<b>we'll never get anywhere</b>

50:30.602 --> 50:32.971
<b>if we're just like</b>
<b>hugging each other.</b>

50:33.005 --> 50:34.606
<b>Girl, I'm okay</b>
<b>with sending people home</b>

50:34.640 --> 50:36.909
<b>because</b>
<b>it's a part of the gig.</b>

50:36.942 --> 50:38.143
<b>We signed up for it.</b>

50:38.177 --> 50:40.312
<b>- Just think of it</b>
<b>as like a business decision.</b>

50:40.345 --> 50:41.680
<b>- So as this goes on,</b>

50:41.713 --> 50:44.483
<b>are you guys gonna go on,</b>
<b>like, the performance that day,</b>

50:44.516 --> 50:45.718
<b>the performance</b>
<b>on the show overall?</b>

50:45.751 --> 50:46.852
<b>- It should be</b>
<b>a combination.</b>

50:46.952 --> 50:47.953
<b>- I'd like to know</b>

50:47.986 --> 50:51.757
<b>if we all have any system</b>
<b>or code in place</b>

50:51.790 --> 50:53.625
<b>for how we would like</b>
<b>to make our decisions</b>

50:53.659 --> 50:54.693
<b>from this night on.</b>

50:54.727 --> 50:56.795
<b>Are we going off</b>
<b>the judges' critiques?</b>

50:56.829 --> 50:58.363
<b>Like, they sort of came</b>

50:58.397 --> 51:00.966
<b>to a little bit</b>
<b>of a consensus last season.</b>

51:00.966 --> 51:03.168
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>So Miss DeLa apparently</b>

51:03.202 --> 51:05.370
<b>is suffering from</b>
<b>the short-term memory loss.</b>

51:05.404 --> 51:07.306
<b>Did you see "All Stars 2?"</b>

51:07.339 --> 51:09.374
<b>The whole group consensus thing</b>
<b>didn't work out.</b>

51:09.408 --> 51:12.277
<b>Yes, we would all love</b>
<b>to be fair,</b>

51:12.311 --> 51:13.312
<b>and I think</b>
<b>we should be fair.</b>

51:13.345 --> 51:15.013
<b>I will respect</b>
<b>the choice you make,</b>

51:15.047 --> 51:16.615
<b>and you should do</b>
<b>the same for me.</b>

51:16.648 --> 51:18.650
<b>- Underlying, we agree with</b>
<b>the judges most of the time.</b>

51:18.684 --> 51:19.818
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- No.</b>

51:19.852 --> 51:21.987
<b>- I think everything</b>
<b>has to come into play.</b>

51:22.020 --> 51:24.490
<b>We should look at</b>
<b>the whole picture.</b>

51:24.523 --> 51:26.625
<b>- As of now,</b>
<b>the elimination strategy</b>

51:26.658 --> 51:28.861
<b>is definitely</b>
<b>a free-for-all.</b>

51:28.894 --> 51:30.696
<b>Who knows</b>
<b>what's gonna happen?</b>

51:30.729 --> 51:33.365
<b>- Can we all agree</b>
<b>that if one of us</b>

51:33.399 --> 51:36.368
<b>lets the other borrow their</b>
<b>gross rhinestone tank top,</b>

51:36.402 --> 51:38.036
<b>that we won't save them?</b>

51:38.070 --> 51:39.938
<b>- Aah!</b>
<b>[all laugh]</b>

51:39.972 --> 51:44.176
<b>- I would like to take a moment</b>
<b>with Morgan and Chi Chi.</b>

51:44.209 --> 51:45.277
<b>- If that's okay with y'all.</b>

51:45.310 --> 51:46.278
<b>- Yeah, that's cool.</b>

51:46.311 --> 51:47.379
<b>- Unless y'all wanna fight.</b>

51:47.413 --> 51:49.415
<b>If y'all wanna fight,</b>
<b>we'll fight.</b>

51:52.351 --> 51:53.619
<b>- All right.</b>

51:53.652 --> 51:55.554
<b>- Hi, how are you?</b>

51:55.587 --> 51:57.056
<b>- It is what it is.</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

51:57.089 --> 51:59.425
<b>- Somebody gotta go home first,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

51:59.458 --> 52:02.694
<b>When it all boils down to it,</b>
<b>I [bleep] up,</b>

52:02.728 --> 52:05.998
<b>but I don't want you</b>
<b>to feel like I'm giving up.</b>

52:06.031 --> 52:08.567
<b>I've always been a fighter.</b>
<b>I've fought my whole life.</b>

52:08.600 --> 52:10.002
<b>I fought to get here.</b>

52:10.035 --> 52:12.204
<b>- I do think you're</b>
<b>a super fierce competitor,</b>

52:12.237 --> 52:14.139
<b>and I know</b>
<b>that you're capable</b>

52:14.173 --> 52:15.507
<b>of stronger work</b>
<b>than you did tonight.</b>

52:15.541 --> 52:17.509
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- But sometimes you're done,</b>

52:17.543 --> 52:19.344
<b>and that's okay,</b>
<b>you know what I mean?</b>

52:19.378 --> 52:21.547
<b>Because you have a full career</b>
<b>ahead of you no matter what.</b>

52:21.580 --> 52:23.148
<b>- I don't want to go home</b>

52:23.182 --> 52:25.884
<b>because I feel like I still</b>
<b>have something to prove,</b>

52:25.984 --> 52:29.121
<b>but I'm really not counting</b>
<b>on DeLa to have my back.</b>

52:31.423 --> 52:35.461
<b>- I haven't been on "Drag Race"</b>
<b>since 2010.</b>

52:35.494 --> 52:37.429
<b>I've wanted this</b>
<b>for so long</b>

52:37.463 --> 52:39.598
<b>because I have</b>
<b>so much more to give</b>

52:39.631 --> 52:40.933
<b>and so much more to show,</b>

52:40.933 --> 52:43.736
<b>and now the chance</b>
<b>that I might be going home,</b>

52:43.769 --> 52:45.370
<b>that's the kick in the tits.</b>

52:45.404 --> 52:46.672
<b>- This is the T.</b>

52:46.705 --> 52:47.773
<b>You're such a bitch.</b>

52:47.806 --> 52:49.341
<b>Like, you could literally</b>
<b>point at someone</b>

52:49.374 --> 52:51.210
<b>and make them feel like</b>
<b>they're gonna [bleep] die.</b>

52:51.243 --> 52:56.415
<b>But I really wish you would</b>
<b>have gave Morgan, like, 1,000%.</b>

52:56.448 --> 52:58.450
<b>- The reason why</b>
<b>I was reserved</b>

52:58.484 --> 52:59.785
<b>was because it was something</b>

52:59.818 --> 53:01.553

54:20.566 --> 54:22.134

<b>If you want to go</b>

54:42.921 --> 54:45.924
<b>I think that they picked on</b>

54:45.924 --> 54:48.460
<b>and the kind of</b>
<b>all-around appearance,</b>

54:48.494 --> 54:51.563

<b>you know.</b>

54:56.168 --> 54:58.170
<b>- Yeah.</b>

54:58.203 --> 55:01.774

56:14.980 --> 56:16.515
<b>Just because I want</b>

56:18.650 --> 56:21.653

<b>but Chi Chi,</b>
<b>I know that you know</b>

<b>that you didn't bring your</b>

59:58.102 --> 1:00:00.237
<b>Morgan, I think</b>

<b>and you tried</b>
<b>something new tonight,</b>

1:00:02.106 --> 1:00:04.108
<b>and I don't think that</b>
<b>it was a perfect payoff,</b>

1:00:04.108 --> 1:00:05.109
<b>and you know that.</b>

1:00:05.142 --> 1:00:07.611
<b>And when we as a group</b>
<b>talked about</b>

1:00:07.645 --> 1:00:10.981
<b>why we might eliminate somebody</b>
<b>moving forward,</b>

1:00:11.015 --> 1:00:13.984
<b>we talked about that we would</b>
<b>not want to make that decision,</b>

1:00:14.018 --> 1:00:15.519
<b>pretty much unanimously,</b>

1:00:15.553 --> 1:00:18.122
<b>based on knocking somebody</b>

<b>as fierce competition</b>
<b>out of the way.</b>

<b>And you were very forthright</b>

1:00:49.119 --> 1:00:52.590
<b>I think she believes that</b>
<b>we're set on a group consensus</b>

<b>of how we're gonna actually</b>
<b>send the girls home,</b>

<b>Baby, that's a completely</b>
<b>different TV show.</b>

1:01:00.564 --> 1:01:02.233
<b>- Performing my own track,</b>
<b>I think,</b>

1:01:02.266 --> 1:01:04.835
<b>was a little,</b>
<b>you know, risqué.</b>

1:01:04.869 --> 1:01:06.537
<b>But I think that</b>
<b>it's a little contradictory</b>

1:01:06.570 --> 1:01:07.905
<b>that DeLa sent me home,</b>

1:01:07.938 --> 1:01:10.441

<b>out of the two.</b>

1:01:10.474 --> 1:01:11.475
