00:25.457 --> 00:26.624
- Hi, it's me.

00:30.480 --> 00:34.063
I, um, I haven't really
told you everything

00:35.917 --> 00:37.000
about myself.

00:38.207 --> 00:41.208
My mother was a drunk,

00:41.209 --> 00:44.042
and my father was a heroin addict.

00:57.655 --> 01:00.238
The things I experienced there,

01:02.337 --> 01:04.504
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

06:18.891 --> 06:21.223
- Hey, ah, the toilets won't flush.

06:21.224 --> 06:23.556
Third floor, men's restroom, again.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.144
There's shit everywhere.

06:25.145 --> 06:26.562
Clean it up.
- Me?

06:27.475 --> 06:29.115
You want me to clean it up?

06:29.116 --> 06:30.471
- What's the issue?

06:30.472 --> 06:33.222
Are we gonna have a problem here?

06:35.398 --> 06:36.398
- No.

06:37.554 --> 06:38.721
- What's that?

06:40.132 --> 06:41.132
- No.

06:43.040 --> 06:44.040
No, sir.

06:44.830 --> 06:45.830
No problem.

07:07.899 --> 07:09.614
- Michael, the greatest battle

07:09.615 --> 07:11.275
is the one that happens within.

07:11.276 --> 07:12.770
You need the loss, Michael.

07:12.771 --> 07:14.838
Through the loss, through the fire,

07:14.839 --> 07:19.172
you'll be forged into the
warrior who you truly are.

07:27.174 --> 07:28.257
- Good, good.

07:35.544 --> 07:39.116
Go for an arm bar, go for an arm bar.

07:39.117 --> 07:40.656
Defend the arm.

07:40.657 --> 07:42.574
Watch the sweep.

07:42.575 --> 07:45.591
There it is, move out, move out.

07:45.592 --> 07:48.459
Use your grips, go for the
triangle, go for the triangle.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.127
There it is, watch the toe hold.

07:52.605 --> 07:53.605
Squeeze.

07:56.615 --> 07:57.615
And time.

08:06.084 --> 08:08.723
So, what is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu

08:08.724 --> 08:11.082
and what is its purpose?

08:11.083 --> 08:13.084
There's a lot of opinions on this.

08:13.085 --> 08:15.696
But to me it's very simple.

08:15.697 --> 08:17.863
To master one's self.

08:17.864 --> 08:18.864
That's it.

08:19.721 --> 08:22.567
You know, to some, it's fighting.

08:22.568 --> 08:24.806
To others, it's art.

08:24.807 --> 08:26.994
To others, it's business.

08:26.995 --> 08:29.418
A way to make money.

08:29.419 --> 08:33.253
But to me, and again,
this is just my opinion,

08:33.254 --> 08:37.440
it's a way to build a better human being.

08:37.441 --> 08:40.142
And if I do that, I can be more successful

08:40.143 --> 08:43.294
at all the other things
that come with life.

08:43.296 --> 08:45.766
But it starts with me.

08:45.767 --> 08:50.017
And the person I build
everyday here on these mats.

08:51.923 --> 08:53.340
Good class today.

09:04.049 --> 09:06.360
You mopping the mats today?

09:06.361 --> 09:07.586
- That's white belt work.

09:07.587 --> 09:08.587
I'm not a white belt.

09:11.430 --> 09:13.729
I can't believe he's been gone a year.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.517
The professor was a great guy.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.668
- Yeah, yeah, he was.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.434
That reminds me.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.573
Here, this is for you.

09:39.845 --> 09:42.262
I thought you should have it.

09:44.915 --> 09:47.574
- I don't know what to say, Michael.

09:47.575 --> 09:51.620
- Professor wore that himself, you know.

09:51.621 --> 09:52.954
- Really?
- Yeah,

09:54.008 --> 09:58.008
that's a piece of history
you got in your hands.

09:59.289 --> 10:01.616
- I'm gonna take good care of it.

10:01.617 --> 10:03.117
- I know you will.

13:25.229 --> 13:27.605
- And not a moment too soon.

13:32.242 --> 13:36.366
She's here this early,
it means she wants money.

13:36.367 --> 13:38.084
- You don't have to pay for
privates upfront, Garrett.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.936
- Look, don't be an
asshole, take the money.

13:41.937 --> 13:44.404
- Thanks, I appreciate it.
- Anytime, Michael.

13:44.405 --> 13:45.904
You should think about
doing some promotion.

13:45.905 --> 13:47.633
Maybe a free Jiu-Jitsu clinic here.

13:47.634 --> 13:48.872
It couldn't hurt.

13:48.873 --> 13:50.920
See you next time.

15:19.408 --> 15:22.631
- Hi, I'm here for the class.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.281
The free class.

15:24.282 --> 15:26.757
Am I in the right place?

15:26.758 --> 15:30.258
- It looks it'll be just you and me today.

15:31.700 --> 15:34.109
- That's okay, I think I'll
just come back another...

15:34.110 --> 15:35.389
- Are you here

15:35.390 --> 15:38.048
for the women's self defense clinic?

15:38.049 --> 15:39.049
- Yeah.

15:42.180 --> 15:43.903
- I'm Michael.

15:43.904 --> 15:44.904
- Noelle.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.238
- Well, Noelle, let's get started.

17:08.930 --> 17:10.936
- Thank you so much for the class.

17:10.938 --> 17:12.256
I really learned a lot.

17:12.257 --> 17:13.974
I hope it was helpful.

17:13.976 --> 17:16.909
- It was, just need to practice.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.577
- Are you interested in classes?

17:20.863 --> 17:24.723
- Yes, but I just moved into a new place

17:24.723 --> 17:26.887
and everything's a little crazy right now.

17:26.887 --> 17:29.334
Plus, money's tight.

17:29.335 --> 17:31.598
- I understand completely.

17:31.599 --> 17:33.756
Well, I'd love to see you around here

17:33.757 --> 17:36.507
whenever your schedule clears up.

17:39.365 --> 17:43.645
Actually, I could use some
help getting organized.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.278
- Uh, I didn't mean anything,
I'm just particular.

17:46.279 --> 17:48.613
- Oh, well, maybe if you have some time,

17:48.614 --> 17:52.334
you can help me get organized around here.

17:52.335 --> 17:55.014
In exchange for classes.

17:55.015 --> 17:56.596
- Really?

17:56.597 --> 17:57.597
- Yes.

18:00.902 --> 18:02.592
- Uh, yeah.

18:02.593 --> 18:03.926
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.929
I'm free most days after five.

18:06.930 --> 18:09.597
Here, let me give you my number.

18:17.124 --> 18:18.653
- Sure, great then.

18:18.654 --> 18:20.487
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:21.762 --> 18:23.763
- Tomorrow it is.

18:23.764 --> 18:25.181
- Tomorrow it is.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.057
- Oh, what's the name of your dojo?

18:33.058 --> 18:35.291
I didn't see a sign outside.

18:35.292 --> 18:37.950
- I'm in-between names right now.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.701
It's, it's been a hell of a year.

18:42.563 --> 18:44.355
- I know the feeling.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.773
See you tomorrow.

18:46.936 --> 18:47.936
- See ya.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.498
It looks great in here.

19:39.499 --> 19:40.869
- You think so?

19:40.870 --> 19:41.953
- Absolutely.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.148
- You like it?

19:46.149 --> 19:48.252
I sorted your bills by
dividing them into stacks,

19:48.253 --> 19:51.503
and I put all of your receipts in here.

19:53.808 --> 19:56.475
- Looks awesome, it really does.

19:59.797 --> 20:00.757
Are you hungry?

20:00.758 --> 20:01.971
I'm, I'm hungry.

20:01.972 --> 20:03.222
Are you hungry?

20:05.581 --> 20:06.706
- Yeah.

20:09.204 --> 20:12.039
So, how long have you had the gym?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.790
The gym with no name.

20:15.123 --> 20:16.764
- A while now.

20:16.765 --> 20:21.071
It was left to me, well,
to us a few years back.

20:21.072 --> 20:22.973
- What do you mean?

20:22.974 --> 20:26.604
- It was my teacher's school and, um,

20:26.605 --> 20:28.495
when he got sick,

20:28.496 --> 20:30.251
he and his wife moved so they could

20:30.252 --> 20:33.502
have some time alone together before...

20:34.574 --> 20:36.241
So he left it to us.

20:37.244 --> 20:38.875
- Us?

20:38.876 --> 20:40.293
- My old partner.

20:41.704 --> 20:44.060
It didn't work out.

20:44.061 --> 20:45.416
- Well, what's his name?

20:45.417 --> 20:46.894
- Victor.

20:46.895 --> 20:49.204
He has a studio just up the street now.

20:49.205 --> 20:50.435
- No, I mean your instructor.

20:50.436 --> 20:52.697
- Professor Rogerio LeMaster.

20:52.698 --> 20:54.003
- Professor?

20:54.004 --> 20:55.936
That's very traditional.

20:55.937 --> 20:57.856
In a good way.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.790
- I wanna teach the way that he taught.

21:00.791 --> 21:03.407
Be the type of man he was.

21:03.408 --> 21:05.281
- And what about Victor, he didn't?

21:05.282 --> 21:06.782
- Victor moved on.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.818
- Were you close?

21:10.819 --> 21:13.604
- I think so, I lived with him.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.798
Well, we both did.

21:15.799 --> 21:18.882
I didn't have the best start in life.

21:20.314 --> 21:22.397
He made a big difference.

21:26.780 --> 21:30.120
How, how did you get the name Noelle?

21:30.121 --> 21:32.760
- I was born on Christmas.

21:32.761 --> 21:34.756
- Christmas Day or Christmas Eve?

21:34.757 --> 21:36.237
- Christmas Day.

21:36.238 --> 21:38.453
- You must get a lot of presents then.

21:49.464 --> 21:50.714
- Hey, Michael.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.748
There's no easy way to say this.

21:54.749 --> 21:56.418
I've been doing my best to do what I can

21:56.419 --> 21:58.586
and I've done all I could.

22:00.263 --> 22:01.725
- About what?

22:01.726 --> 22:03.647
- Well, layoffs.

22:03.648 --> 22:05.536
- You said that...
- I said I did all I could.

22:05.537 --> 22:07.854
But around here, it's
last hired, first fired,

22:07.855 --> 22:09.924
and you were last hired.

22:09.925 --> 22:12.051
My hands are tied, I gotta let you go.

22:12.052 --> 22:14.350
- You're firing me?

22:14.351 --> 22:16.313
- There's nothing I can do.

22:16.314 --> 22:17.314
Here.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.297
Take it.

22:21.981 --> 22:25.411
You know what it is, it's your severance.

22:25.412 --> 22:28.079
Look, if anybody calls and asks,

22:29.018 --> 22:31.518
I'll give ya a recommendation.

22:32.516 --> 22:33.599
Just take it.

23:11.464 --> 23:13.943
- It's good to see new faces here tonight.

23:13.944 --> 23:17.835
You know, the first step
is always the hardest.

23:17.836 --> 23:19.972
Some of the ladies who have
been through the program

23:19.973 --> 23:22.287
can back me up on that.

23:22.288 --> 23:24.997
Well, who would like to share?

23:24.998 --> 23:29.998
- He was very possessive, he
taunted me the entire time.

23:30.361 --> 23:32.901
I went to reach for the
door and he grabbed my arm.

23:32.902 --> 23:34.730
He flung me so hard to the ground

23:34.731 --> 23:38.647
that I instantly felt something just pop.

23:38.648 --> 23:40.352
Somehow we ended up in the bedroom

23:40.353 --> 23:41.493
and I was on my bed,

23:41.494 --> 23:43.478
he was on top of me, holding me down

23:43.479 --> 23:47.321
and trying to cover my mouth
as I screamed for help.

23:47.322 --> 23:50.737
And then from that it went
into he started chocking me.

23:50.738 --> 23:53.350
I tried to get up and every time I got up,

23:53.351 --> 23:56.714
he would just grab me and
throw me to the ground.

23:56.715 --> 23:58.013
And I'm screaming for help,

23:58.014 --> 24:00.330
"Somebody help me, please,
help me, I need help!"

24:00.331 --> 24:02.877
It made, Cesar just
stopped dead in his tracks.

24:02.878 --> 24:05.199
And I said, "You need to
leave, leave right now."

24:05.200 --> 24:07.045
So since then it's just been a process

24:07.046 --> 24:12.046
of trying to find healing and
moving forward with my life.

24:12.403 --> 24:15.369
- Thanks for sharing, Carla.

24:15.370 --> 24:19.010
Anyone else who would like to share?

24:19.011 --> 24:22.178
Noelle, would you like to share today?

25:25.041 --> 25:26.315
- And I'm like really, bro?

25:26.316 --> 25:27.779
Like you picked that picture?

25:27.780 --> 25:29.894
Like, ah, like, I look like a maniac.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.297
Like, come on, man.

25:31.298 --> 25:32.538
You could have found a
better picture than that.

25:32.539 --> 25:33.796
And it was like on a poster,

25:33.797 --> 25:35.831
you know what I mean, the
main poster, I'm like, uh.

25:35.832 --> 25:37.399
He did take one good picture, though.

25:43.923 --> 25:46.007
I'm gonna do this one over and over again.

26:14.598 --> 26:15.958
- There you are.

26:15.959 --> 26:17.736
- Hey, Garrett, what's up?

26:17.737 --> 26:19.904
- Forget about my private?

26:26.920 --> 26:30.282
Funny, I didn't know you smoke.

26:30.283 --> 26:31.283
- I don't.

26:32.618 --> 26:35.045
I didn't know you smoked.

26:35.046 --> 26:36.463
- I don't either.

26:39.551 --> 26:42.287
So this your spot, huh?

26:42.288 --> 26:44.228
Where you go to steal a cigarette.

26:44.229 --> 26:45.333
I have mine but with what I do,

26:45.334 --> 26:48.639
it's getting harder to get
away with it these days.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.082
- I don't know if I ever asked,

26:50.083 --> 26:51.579
what is it you do?

26:51.580 --> 26:52.633
- Isn't it obvious?

26:52.634 --> 26:54.290
I'm a pastor.
- Really?

26:54.291 --> 26:56.440
- Mm-hmm, I'm responsible
for nearly 2,000 souls.

26:56.441 --> 26:58.653
Ain't that some shit?

26:58.654 --> 27:00.612
It's hard work, but
you know what they say,

27:00.613 --> 27:02.585
the lord rewards the faithful.

27:02.586 --> 27:04.819
Plus I get free rent for my Judo club.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.648
Can't complain.

27:06.649 --> 27:08.101
- The lord's work, huh?

27:08.102 --> 27:11.624
- Yep, confiscated this pack
from a guy at the men's home.

27:11.625 --> 27:12.625
It's ironic.

27:14.005 --> 27:15.009
- What is?

27:15.010 --> 27:18.109
- You would think they know
these things are addictive.

27:18.110 --> 27:19.544
- Last weekend at the competition,

27:19.545 --> 27:20.538
you could have done a lot better,

27:20.538 --> 27:21.435
but what I'm gonna need you to do,

27:21.436 --> 27:22.801
is when I'm coaching you,

27:22.802 --> 27:24.270
you need you to listen to me, okay?

27:24.271 --> 27:25.800
When I say pass the guard,

27:25.801 --> 27:26.863
that means pass the guard,

27:26.864 --> 27:28.161
That doesn't mean try to choke him out

27:28.162 --> 27:29.371
from inside of his guard, okay?

27:29.372 --> 27:30.474
That's how you got swept,

27:30.475 --> 27:32.585
that's how you lost your match, all right?

27:32.586 --> 27:36.268
So when I'm coaching, you
pay attention, all right?

27:36.269 --> 27:37.907
Focus, all eyes on me.

27:37.908 --> 27:40.508
If I look up and I see
your eyes doing this

27:40.509 --> 27:42.489
or looking around or something,

27:42.490 --> 27:43.869
I'm gonna make you a thousand pushups,

27:43.870 --> 27:46.573
I'm gonna make you jog until
your legs fall off, okay?

27:46.574 --> 27:49.170
So, from now on, when
I tell you something,

27:49.171 --> 27:51.454
when I'm coaching you, you need
to listen to me, all right?

27:51.455 --> 27:53.827
Period, that's it, got it?

27:53.828 --> 27:55.870
All right, hands in the middle.

27:55.871 --> 27:57.871
- Team Figueroa!

28:23.610 --> 28:25.443
- So, what's the plan?

28:26.675 --> 28:28.053
- I thought you could use a break.

28:28.054 --> 28:29.325
- A break?

28:29.326 --> 28:32.269
- Consider it payback for the tacos.

28:32.270 --> 28:33.236
- Really?

28:33.236 --> 28:34.236
- Really.

28:35.098 --> 28:37.483
But, I just need to find one thing.

28:37.484 --> 28:38.868
I usually wear sunglasses

28:38.869 --> 28:41.363
but it looks like I lost another pair.

28:41.364 --> 28:43.028
- You?

28:43.029 --> 28:44.225
- Me, what?

28:44.226 --> 28:45.511
- Lose your sunglasses?

28:45.512 --> 28:48.187
- Yeah, all the time, why?

28:48.188 --> 28:50.816
- I wouldn't think that.

28:50.817 --> 28:52.417
- How's that?

28:52.418 --> 28:55.335
- You're so put together.

28:56.290 --> 28:57.352
- I'm put together?

28:57.353 --> 28:59.840
- I mean, you're organized.

28:59.841 --> 29:02.662
At least you seem to be organized.

29:02.663 --> 29:04.830
What I'm trying to say is,

29:05.997 --> 29:08.330
you have your shit together.

29:12.141 --> 29:13.141
- Really?

29:13.957 --> 29:15.457
Do you think that?

29:18.539 --> 29:19.622
- Yeah, I do.

29:23.399 --> 29:28.111
- That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

29:28.112 --> 29:29.112
- Really?

29:32.477 --> 29:35.360
So, um, where are we going?

29:35.361 --> 29:36.361
- Galveston.

29:37.871 --> 29:38.871
- Galveston?

32:24.351 --> 32:25.351
- Noelle?

32:42.016 --> 32:43.016
Buh-bye.

32:52.767 --> 32:55.267
- You okay?
- What the hell man?

32:55.268 --> 32:56.241
You diggin' in my side.

32:56.242 --> 32:57.461
You gettin' all that weight.

32:57.462 --> 32:58.794
That shit ain't cool.

32:58.795 --> 32:59.814
- It was a regular roll.

32:59.815 --> 33:01.124
- Regular for Jiu-Jitsu.

33:01.125 --> 33:04.508
This ain't Judo, this
ain't about size, man.

33:04.509 --> 33:06.274
- You hear me complaining
when all these little guys

33:06.275 --> 33:07.835
are climbing all over my ass?

33:07.836 --> 33:09.512
But I, I'm not suppose to play my game.

33:09.513 --> 33:10.474
Maxi can play his,
- Guys.

33:10.475 --> 33:11.956
- but I can't play mine, right?

33:11.957 --> 33:13.340
- I was rolling light with you.

33:13.341 --> 33:15.151
What, you can't tell the difference?

33:15.152 --> 33:16.909
- Everyone gets caught, Maxi.

33:16.910 --> 33:18.879
Everyone, today you caught by me.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.564
You don't like that but it happened.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.978
Big deal.

33:21.979 --> 33:23.768
- You got no fucking technique.

33:23.769 --> 33:26.640
You do that shit again and
I'll put your fat ass to sleep.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.308
- Get your shit together, son.

33:30.309 --> 33:31.353
- I ain't your son!

33:31.354 --> 33:34.021
- Guys, guys, cool it.

33:35.991 --> 33:38.357
- I'll always be here, Maxi.

33:38.358 --> 33:41.441
I'll always be around if you need me.

33:43.893 --> 33:45.047
- What's the deal?

33:45.048 --> 33:47.049
- I don't need this right now, Michael.

33:47.050 --> 33:50.704
- Don't need what, what's the problem?

33:50.705 --> 33:52.491
The, the school, you, you have
a problem with the school?

33:52.492 --> 33:53.427
- No.
- 'Cause I haven't

33:53.427 --> 33:54.342
named the school yet?

33:54.342 --> 33:55.175
- No.
- What then,

33:55.176 --> 33:56.224
is it with me?

33:56.225 --> 33:57.353
- No!

33:57.354 --> 33:59.271
- So what then, Victor?

34:01.728 --> 34:03.645
- It's not just Victor.

34:04.656 --> 34:07.918
Everyone's training over there now.

34:07.919 --> 34:09.335
We were a family.

34:10.351 --> 34:13.351
We, we were supposed to be a family.

34:15.803 --> 34:18.192
- So, you wanna go with them, is that it?

34:18.193 --> 34:19.444
I understand, that's your choice.

34:19.445 --> 34:21.695
- That's not it.
- You sure?

34:23.447 --> 34:25.982
You're almost there, Maxi.

34:25.983 --> 34:26.998
- I'm almost where?

34:26.998 --> 34:28.860
- The next level.

34:28.860 --> 34:32.560
The jump from blue to purple
is always the hardest.

34:32.561 --> 34:35.311
What's the most important lesson?

34:37.938 --> 34:39.605
To know when to tap.

34:41.808 --> 34:44.456
I'm setting you up for success.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.068
The way the master did for me.

34:46.069 --> 34:47.069
Are we cool?

34:48.739 --> 34:50.322
- Yeah, we're cool.

34:52.937 --> 34:57.770
- You should be at home resting
for the eight-man, anyway.

34:59.111 --> 35:00.694
And mop these mats.

35:20.836 --> 35:22.918
- All right.

35:35.036 --> 35:36.036
- Winner.

35:37.491 --> 35:40.225
- Grab the leg,
there it is, there it is.

35:40.226 --> 35:41.226
Good, good.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.215
You need to set.

35:44.216 --> 35:45.216
All right.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.952
Let me tell you something,

36:04.953 --> 36:06.213
you wanna get to that next level,

36:06.214 --> 36:08.131
you wanna upgrade this,

36:08.989 --> 36:10.605
at Team Figueroa, we're doing big things.

36:10.606 --> 36:11.533
You gotta step it up, man.

36:11.534 --> 36:13.636
You gotta be training wise all day.

36:13.637 --> 36:17.220
You know, be technical,
be strong, be fast.

36:22.421 --> 36:23.588
- Here you go.

36:24.729 --> 36:25.729
Michael?

36:26.916 --> 36:29.037
You don't like losing much, do you?

36:29.038 --> 36:30.955
At least not to Victor.

36:33.141 --> 36:36.474
Michael, why am I bringing you here now?

36:39.123 --> 36:41.373
- I don't know what to say.

36:43.605 --> 36:46.022
- It's been a hell of a year.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.017
- Here.

36:51.018 --> 36:54.887
I got this for you.

36:54.888 --> 36:55.888
- For me?

36:56.976 --> 36:57.976
- Open it.

37:05.072 --> 37:08.655
Just wanted to thank
you for all your help.

37:10.916 --> 37:12.999
- How do I look?

37:14.633 --> 37:15.633
- Fancy.

37:16.786 --> 37:18.057
- I feel fancy.

37:24.422 --> 37:26.922
Michael, if you need anything,

37:28.272 --> 37:29.855
someone to talk to,

37:30.932 --> 37:33.430
you can tell me anything.

37:33.431 --> 37:35.019
I feel like I can tell you anything

37:35.020 --> 37:37.770
and I want you to feel that same.

37:39.522 --> 37:40.522
- I know.

38:13.454 --> 38:14.454
There he is.

38:15.434 --> 38:17.502
Where you been today, you missed class?

38:17.503 --> 38:21.983
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

38:21.984 --> 38:24.891
- There's something I need
to talk to you about too.

38:24.892 --> 38:25.892
- What?

38:26.868 --> 38:27.868
- Training.

38:29.201 --> 38:30.534
- What about it?

38:31.403 --> 38:33.801
- That's just it, Michael.

38:33.802 --> 38:34.802
I did.

38:35.576 --> 38:36.576
- Did what?

38:38.240 --> 38:39.240
- Train.

38:42.188 --> 38:44.132
I trained today.

38:44.133 --> 38:45.300
- What, where?

38:47.376 --> 38:48.543
- At Victor's.

38:51.419 --> 38:53.371
- You trained today at Victor's.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.326
- I just needed to mix it up

38:54.327 --> 38:56.563
with a different group, you understand.

38:56.564 --> 38:58.470
- I understand.

38:58.471 --> 39:01.221
You went to Victor's and trained.

39:03.310 --> 39:06.546
- I'm not progressing, Michael.

39:06.547 --> 39:10.613
I feel stuck and he helped me
work on a couple of things.

39:10.614 --> 39:11.613
- Victor?
- Yeah, he helped me

39:11.614 --> 39:14.333
on a few details.
- A few details?

39:14.334 --> 39:15.334
- Well.

39:19.610 --> 39:20.943
He gave me this.

39:23.342 --> 39:25.049
I wanted to tell you myself.

39:25.050 --> 39:26.717
I owe you that much.

39:29.448 --> 39:32.198
- You don't owe me a thing, Maxi.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.983
- I thought you might want this back.

39:48.033 --> 39:49.116
- It's yours.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.283
You've earned it.

39:59.219 --> 40:01.288
- Thanks, Michael.

40:01.289 --> 40:02.622
I appreciate it.

40:14.614 --> 40:15.614
Hey.

40:17.150 --> 40:19.983
What'd you wanna talk to me about?

40:22.623 --> 40:24.373
- It's not important.

40:26.805 --> 40:27.805
Not anymore.

41:44.324 --> 41:45.324
Nice gym.

41:47.927 --> 41:50.260
- What the hell do you want?

41:51.724 --> 41:52.898
- It's never enough for you.

41:52.899 --> 41:54.402
You already took everything.

41:54.403 --> 41:56.084
Now you had to take Maxi too?

41:56.085 --> 41:57.360
- If a student feels like he can get

41:57.361 --> 41:59.758
better training from a better
coach, then that's on him,

41:59.759 --> 42:01.325
and it has nothing to
do with me, all right?

42:01.326 --> 42:02.612
Why don't you just get
the hell outta here.

42:02.613 --> 42:04.709
- We're not done.

42:04.710 --> 42:07.127
- You wanna talk, let's talk.

Where have you been?

44:50.591 --> 44:52.508
- I went to see Victor.

44:53.940 --> 44:57.357
- What's going on Michael, what happened?

45:00.413 --> 45:02.233
You know what, don't tell me,

45:02.234 --> 45:03.817
I don't wanna know.

45:06.096 --> 45:08.929
- I, uh, I don't know what to say.

45:12.826 --> 45:14.308
- That's it?

45:14.309 --> 45:16.309
- I don't, I don't know.

45:17.274 --> 45:18.768
What do you want?

45:18.769 --> 45:20.186
- What do I want?

45:21.915 --> 45:25.173
What I want is a life
without all this shit.

45:25.174 --> 45:26.423
- What shit?

45:26.424 --> 45:30.691
- I don't want a life
surrounded by violence anymore.

45:30.692 --> 45:31.692
- Anymore?

45:35.443 --> 45:37.193
- I was married once,

45:40.239 --> 45:42.739
and my husband used to hit me.

45:46.770 --> 45:50.020
He would come home and he would hit me.

45:51.570 --> 45:53.712
I thought it would change
or maybe he would change

45:53.713 --> 45:55.130
but it never did.

45:56.998 --> 45:58.415
And he never did.

46:00.267 --> 46:01.686
- How long?

46:01.687 --> 46:02.937
- For too long.

46:04.646 --> 46:06.105
- You never told me.

46:06.106 --> 46:07.672
- I don't want that in my life anymore.

46:07.673 --> 46:09.006
I wanna move on.

46:09.887 --> 46:11.121
Live a life where I don't flinch

46:11.122 --> 46:13.341
at the sight of the man that I love.

46:13.342 --> 46:15.094
I want better.

46:15.095 --> 46:17.171
I deserve better and
it took me long enough

46:17.172 --> 46:20.164
to believe it but I deserve better.

46:20.165 --> 46:22.550
- Why didn't you ever tell me?

46:22.551 --> 46:24.662
- I kept that part of my life private.

46:24.663 --> 46:25.989
- I thought you could tell me anything?

46:25.990 --> 46:27.691
- I thought I could, but not anymore.

46:27.692 --> 46:29.027
- Why, because of one night?

46:29.028 --> 46:32.020
- No, because I wanna finally be happy.

46:32.021 --> 46:33.199
- And you're not happy now?

46:33.200 --> 46:34.696
- Not with the fights.

46:34.697 --> 46:36.427
Not with picking you up off some street

46:36.428 --> 46:37.672
and all for what?

46:37.673 --> 46:39.781
- It was important.

46:39.782 --> 46:43.615
- There's more to life
than fighting, Michael.

46:46.546 --> 46:48.713
- You wouldn't understand.

46:54.569 --> 46:55.569
- Get out.

46:58.935 --> 46:59.887
- You want me to leave?

46:59.887 --> 47:00.887
- Get out.

47:02.548 --> 47:03.548
Get out!

47:11.011 --> 47:15.108
♪ The place where all
that you can do is swing ♪

47:15.109 --> 47:18.238

47:57.843 --> 47:59.316
- What's up, Janette?

47:59.317 --> 48:02.650
- I'm gonna be making a switch, Michael.

48:04.032 --> 48:05.346
- What, what do you mean?

48:05.347 --> 48:08.422
- What do you mean, what do I mean?

48:08.423 --> 48:10.459
You've been on your own for six months

48:10.460 --> 48:12.807
but your classes keep getting smaller.

48:12.808 --> 48:15.715
You're late with rent,
if you pay at all, plus...

48:15.716 --> 48:17.477
- Plus what?

48:17.478 --> 48:20.682
- Plus people are beginning
to notice that you sleep here.

48:20.683 --> 48:23.846
This is a business, it's not a shelter.

48:23.847 --> 48:26.627
- You knew that, I
never hid that from you.

48:26.628 --> 48:28.515
- I thought that you would be staying here

48:28.516 --> 48:31.429
for a few weeks while you
got your life together.

48:31.430 --> 48:34.680
Not indefinitely and not for this long.

48:35.822 --> 48:38.489
Don't you want more out of life?

48:39.904 --> 48:42.193
Go ahead and finish out
the rest of the month

48:42.194 --> 48:43.655
with your classes.

48:43.656 --> 48:45.919
That'll give you time to find a new place.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.785
But be out by the first.

48:47.786 --> 48:49.472
- There's gotta be something...
- It's non-negotiable,

48:49.473 --> 48:50.317
Michael.

48:50.318 --> 48:52.313
You have until the first.

48:52.314 --> 48:53.314
That's it.

48:54.194 --> 48:57.736
You know, I hear Victor's
gym is doing pretty good.

48:57.737 --> 49:01.751
Have you thought about
getting back with him?

49:01.752 --> 49:03.344
- I'll look into it.

49:03.345 --> 49:05.345
- You do that.

49:27.978 --> 49:28.978
- Hey.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.550
- Are you okay?

49:32.683 --> 49:35.207
- I don't know,
things are a little crazy.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.762
- I heard.

49:36.763 --> 49:38.449
- Heard what?

49:38.450 --> 49:39.700
- About things.

49:40.971 --> 49:42.888
How are you holding up?

49:43.882 --> 49:45.132
Good, I'm good.

49:46.593 --> 49:48.699
- Just good?

49:48.700 --> 49:49.700
- Good.

49:51.072 --> 49:52.072
Good.

49:53.740 --> 49:56.310
- Can I give you a little advice?

49:56.311 --> 49:57.311
- Go for it.

49:59.157 --> 50:01.578
- If you think maybe

50:01.579 --> 50:05.266
you found someone you
can fall in love with,

50:05.267 --> 50:10.017
and maybe that person might
fall in love with you back,

50:10.018 --> 50:13.061
as long as they're not a
complete piece of shit,

50:13.062 --> 50:14.812
you should go for it.

50:15.757 --> 50:20.491
Life is short and you
deserve to be happy, Noelle.

50:20.492 --> 50:24.650
- You're the strangest
pastor I've ever met.

50:24.651 --> 50:25.588
- Thank you.

50:25.589 --> 50:28.087
You gonna train?

50:28.088 --> 50:30.894
- I was but I think I'm heading home.

50:30.895 --> 50:31.895
- You sure?

50:32.827 --> 50:35.182
- I'm not sure about anything these days.

50:35.183 --> 50:37.199
- I've been there.

50:37.200 --> 50:38.533
Well drive safe.

50:39.799 --> 50:41.368
And nice sunglasses.

50:41.369 --> 50:42.655
They suit you.

50:59.692 --> 51:02.283
- The landlord
says I have to get out.

51:02.284 --> 51:03.951
- By when?

51:05.280 --> 51:06.697
- The first.
- Oh.

51:07.868 --> 51:11.285
I can't say I didn't see that one coming.

51:14.105 --> 51:17.439
Old ladies at my church
are driving me crazy.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.700
I guess my Judo club is interfering

51:18.701 --> 51:22.656
with their Bingo Night or some dumb shit.

51:22.657 --> 51:24.249
I got a little property.

51:24.250 --> 51:26.119
I think I'll move my club there.

51:26.120 --> 51:27.266
- Really?

51:27.267 --> 51:29.521
- It's nothing glamorous,
four walls, some mats.

51:29.522 --> 51:31.024
Got a bed in the back.

51:31.025 --> 51:32.664
- Mm-hmm.

51:32.665 --> 51:34.173
Sounds nice.

51:34.174 --> 51:35.196
- So what do you think?

51:35.197 --> 51:38.263
You teaching there, what do you think?

51:38.264 --> 51:39.953
- At your gym?
- Yes, about you

51:39.954 --> 51:42.338
teaching at my gym, what do you think?

51:42.339 --> 51:43.323
- How far is it?

51:43.324 --> 51:44.879
- From this paradise?

51:44.880 --> 51:46.481
It's not far.

51:46.482 --> 51:49.507
Do you wanna know the truth, Michael?

51:49.508 --> 51:51.952
It's dead for you here.

51:51.953 --> 51:52.794
Now maybe you should take a look

51:52.794 --> 51:53.749
in the mirror and ask yourself

51:53.750 --> 51:56.271
what part you played in all this.

51:56.272 --> 51:57.814
Maybe it's just your season of suffer.

51:57.815 --> 51:59.882
Maybe it's a little bit
of both, I don't know.

51:59.883 --> 52:01.941
What I don know is I'm
offering you a chance.

52:01.942 --> 52:03.485
A chance to start over fresh.

52:03.486 --> 52:07.381
And most people don't get that in life.

52:07.382 --> 52:10.132

53:51.947 --> 53:54.030
Well, who wants to start?

53:56.427 --> 53:57.427
Anyone?

54:00.232 --> 54:01.232
Anyone?

54:05.451 --> 54:06.451
Anyone?

54:10.932 --> 54:13.099
- I have something to say.

54:14.095 --> 54:15.606
- Noelle.

54:15.607 --> 54:18.024
What would you like to share?

54:24.686 --> 54:27.024
- My father wasn't around much.

54:27.025 --> 54:28.732
He had a business.

54:28.733 --> 54:30.601
A little shop.

54:30.602 --> 54:33.142
He was really proud of it.

54:33.143 --> 54:35.592
And I remember one night he came home,

54:35.593 --> 54:38.936
and he just started screaming at my mom

54:38.937 --> 54:40.687
about money, I think.

54:42.746 --> 54:44.746
And it was just so loud.

54:47.648 --> 54:49.432
And I stood there in the living room

54:49.433 --> 54:52.350
with my hands over my ears, crying.

54:54.103 --> 54:57.956
And he turned at me and he
yells at me to be quiet.

54:57.957 --> 54:59.207
But I couldn't.

55:00.894 --> 55:02.227
I was so scared.

55:04.898 --> 55:07.529
So then he took a pot
of hot tea off the oven

55:07.530 --> 55:09.363
and he threw it at me.

55:13.162 --> 55:14.579
And then he said,

55:18.155 --> 55:20.572
"I wish you were never born."

55:25.805 --> 55:28.888
I was eight and that's how I grew up.

55:32.140 --> 55:34.904
Some nights, he threw chairs

55:34.905 --> 55:38.365
and other nights it was beatings.

55:38.366 --> 55:41.116
And you'd think I'd learn but no.

55:42.209 --> 55:46.842
I married the first guy
that told me I was pretty.

55:46.843 --> 55:49.084
That's all he had to say.

55:49.085 --> 55:51.085
"You're pretty, Noelle."

55:52.011 --> 55:54.678
And I fell in love, got married.

55:55.929 --> 55:57.596
And then it started.

55:59.237 --> 56:00.904
The hitting started.

56:03.264 --> 56:05.484
He'd apologize and say, "Sorry,"

56:05.485 --> 56:08.164
and promise it would be the last time.

56:08.165 --> 56:10.832
But it was always the last time.

56:12.227 --> 56:14.864
And then I got pregnant.

56:14.865 --> 56:19.667
And he wanted me to get
rid of him but I had him.

56:19.668 --> 56:21.168
I had Christopher.

56:23.023 --> 56:27.006
And the first time I looked into his eyes,

56:27.007 --> 56:28.840
they looked like mine.

56:30.074 --> 56:31.907
They looked like mine.

56:34.191 --> 56:35.316
And then I saw the eyes

56:35.317 --> 56:38.253
of that little girl
standing in the living room

56:38.254 --> 56:40.734
with her hands over her ear crying,

56:40.735 --> 56:45.068
and I knew I had to get him
as far away as possible.

56:49.636 --> 56:50.636
So at 19,

56:53.589 --> 56:56.922
I gave him up and signed my rights away.

56:58.569 --> 57:00.969
And now I'm not sure

57:00.970 --> 57:04.470
if I'll ever get to see my baby boy again.

57:11.228 --> 57:12.228
Thank you.

57:23.796 --> 57:25.988
- I've been doing a lot
of thinking about pain.

57:25.989 --> 57:29.290
I like it, pain's a good part of life.

57:29.291 --> 57:31.343
- You think so?

57:31.344 --> 57:32.901
- Without pain, you wouldn't know joy.

57:32.902 --> 57:34.553
I mean, really know joy.

57:34.554 --> 57:35.732
Pain's good.

57:35.733 --> 57:38.131
My point is, everything in
life that's worth a damn,

57:38.132 --> 57:40.681
came from a place of hardship.

57:40.682 --> 57:42.349
Of anguish, of pain.

57:43.727 --> 57:46.136
We're here to embrace it, learn from it.

57:46.137 --> 57:48.887
And become who we're meant to be.

57:51.997 --> 57:54.885
- What if I don't know who that is?

57:54.886 --> 57:57.740
- What do you mean?

57:57.741 --> 57:58.741
- LeMaster.

58:00.019 --> 58:02.769
He, um, he left something for me.

58:04.228 --> 58:05.466
Something big.

58:05.467 --> 58:08.922
- You don't think you deserve it.

58:08.923 --> 58:10.033
- It's not that.

58:10.034 --> 58:12.117
- That wasn't a question.

58:13.790 --> 58:16.040
- It's just, it's something

58:17.517 --> 58:19.467
I don't think I can accept.

58:19.468 --> 58:20.801
- You're scared.

58:22.259 --> 58:23.923
- Was that a question?

58:23.924 --> 58:24.924
- No.

58:26.472 --> 58:29.346
Let me ask you this, Michael.

58:29.347 --> 58:31.136
When you lay awake at night

58:31.137 --> 58:33.856
and imagine the person you wish to become,

58:33.857 --> 58:35.357
who is it you see?

58:36.273 --> 58:39.404
Now what would you give
to become that person?

58:39.405 --> 58:42.831
How much pain are you willing to endure?

58:42.832 --> 58:45.744
How much sacrifice are
you willing to take?

58:45.745 --> 58:49.686
What dragon would you slay
to become that person?

58:49.687 --> 58:52.751
What battle would you gladly die for?

58:52.752 --> 58:55.971
When your enemies come for
you, and they will come,

58:55.972 --> 58:58.354
what will you do on that day?

58:58.355 --> 59:01.172
When you look into the
mouth of a hungry lion,

59:01.173 --> 59:05.148
with everything in you, will you fight?

59:05.149 --> 59:06.858
When the people that love you gather

59:06.859 --> 59:08.623
to tell the story of your life,

59:08.624 --> 59:10.737
what will they say?

59:10.738 --> 59:13.321
Will they call you lion killer?

59:20.521 --> 59:22.156
- That's really good.

- If you're here about the house,

01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:17.093
now's not a good time.

01:01:18.251 --> 01:01:19.334
Oh, it's you.

01:01:22.289 --> 01:01:23.289
- It's me.

01:01:25.623 --> 01:01:27.902
- Well you're late.

01:01:27.903 --> 01:01:30.403
The memorial was this morning.

01:01:32.738 --> 01:01:35.988
- I know, I, I didn't know if I could...

01:01:37.436 --> 01:01:38.519
- Could what?

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.728
Pay your respects?

01:01:41.729 --> 01:01:42.862
You always did have a problem

01:01:42.863 --> 01:01:45.863
with that word, respect, didn't you?

01:01:47.968 --> 01:01:49.726
Where's the other one?

01:01:49.727 --> 01:01:50.727
Figueroa?

01:01:51.956 --> 01:01:52.994
- Victor?

01:01:52.995 --> 01:01:55.408
- Yeah, where's Victor?

01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:57.659
- He, um, couldn't make it.

01:02:00.975 --> 01:02:02.632
- He couldn't make it?

01:02:02.633 --> 01:02:03.883
That's perfect.

01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:06.635
Give me those.

01:02:06.636 --> 01:02:08.352
- Sorry, they were on the door

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:09.686
when I got here.

01:02:10.615 --> 01:02:13.032
I was gonna give them to you.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:18.479
- Do you have any idea

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.718
what I've been going through?

01:02:20.719 --> 01:02:22.136
Do you even care?

01:02:23.597 --> 01:02:27.097
- I, I just wanted to come by and see you.

01:02:32.085 --> 01:02:34.602
- Well know you've seen me.

01:02:34.603 --> 01:02:36.534
Now you can be proud of yourself.

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:39.785
- No, no, I mean, see how you're doing.

01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:48.759
- Did you do this?

01:02:50.785 --> 01:02:53.869
- It was on the door when I got here.

01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:55.370
- Did you do this?

01:02:56.728 --> 01:03:00.088
- It was on the door, I promise.

01:03:00.089 --> 01:03:04.256
- This envelope was on the
door with all the rest?

01:03:24.248 --> 01:03:25.998
He left this for you.

01:03:29.608 --> 01:03:30.941
- Me and Victor?

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:34.499
- No, just for you.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:44.943
- What is it?

01:03:49.044 --> 01:03:52.211
- That is all that I have left of him.

01:06:26.693 --> 01:06:27.860
- Hi, it's me.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:35.038
I, um, I don't really know what to say.

01:06:37.283 --> 01:06:41.450
I haven't really told you
everything about myself.

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:48.049
Uh, my mother was a drunk,

01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:53.116
and my father was a heroine addict

01:06:53.117 --> 01:06:54.950
that used to beat her.

01:06:56.866 --> 01:07:00.803
I got put in a group home when I was nine.

01:07:00.804 --> 01:07:02.903
And things I experienced there,

01:07:02.904 --> 01:07:05.071
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

01:07:07.744 --> 01:07:09.994
I had a foster family once.

01:07:11.744 --> 01:07:15.327
One day, I pushed him
down and I kicked him

01:07:17.226 --> 01:07:19.714
and I kept kicking him.

01:07:19.715 --> 01:07:21.762
He packed my things in a plastic trash bag

01:07:21.763 --> 01:07:26.430
and put me in a car and dropped
me off at that bus stop.

01:07:29.154 --> 01:07:32.904
And I slept there and
in people's cars until,

01:07:33.928 --> 01:07:36.428
until LeMaster gave me a home.

01:07:40.788 --> 01:07:43.871
I know I should have told you, but...

01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:49.082
Not a day goes by where I
don't think about those people.

01:07:49.083 --> 01:07:50.945
About what I did.

01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:54.335
I want you to know that not a day goes by

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.836
where I don't think about you.

01:07:59.096 --> 01:08:02.128
And I know I'm a hypocrite.

01:08:02.129 --> 01:08:04.388
I tell everyone that Jiu-Jitsu

01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:06.722
made me a better person, but

01:08:07.718 --> 01:08:09.468
the truth is, Noelle,

01:08:12.233 --> 01:08:15.483
Jiu-Jitsu makes my life better but you,

01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:21.540
you make me want a better life.

01:08:23.413 --> 01:08:24.997
I love you, Noelle.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:31.314
I just,

01:08:33.897 --> 01:08:36.479
I just wanted you to know that.

01:10:28.435 --> 01:10:31.994
- Where did you get that gi?

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:32.995
- A gift.

01:10:34.176 --> 01:10:35.176
- From who?

01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:37.614
- Uh, a friend.

01:10:39.822 --> 01:10:43.557
- So Michael gave you
the old man's gi, huh?

01:10:43.558 --> 01:10:45.808
Time, Maxi, you're with me.

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:14.169
- What's up?

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.039
What happened?

01:11:19.635 --> 01:11:20.635
How?

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.337
I'll call you back.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.644
Michael, there no difference

01:11:40.645 --> 01:11:42.144
between victory and defeat.

01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:43.968
You need the loss, Michael.

01:11:43.969 --> 01:11:46.953
The greatest battle is the
one that happens within.

01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:49.910
You'll be forged into the
warrior who you truly are.

01:11:49.911 --> 01:11:51.794
What's the hardest lesson to learn?

01:11:51.795 --> 01:11:53.351
To know when to tap.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:57.019
Michael.

01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:10.181
- You didn't get enough last time?

01:12:10.182 --> 01:12:13.548
You know the gym's closed, right?

01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:15.910
- My fighting days are over.

01:12:15.911 --> 01:12:17.161
I owe you this.

01:12:18.158 --> 01:12:21.575
I shouldn't have taken it without asking.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:26.730
You didn't have to break his arm.

01:12:28.152 --> 01:12:30.103
- Look, man, accidents happen.

01:12:30.104 --> 01:12:32.934
- You also took something from him.

01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:33.935
- What?

01:12:37.544 --> 01:12:38.593
LeMaster's gi?

01:12:38.594 --> 01:12:42.484
You came all the way up here for that?

01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:44.722
You want it back?

01:12:44.723 --> 01:12:48.009
You're gonna have to roll me for it.

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:49.389
- I didn't bring a gi.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:51.314
- It's okay, wear this one.

01:12:51.315 --> 01:12:52.918
I'll get it back in a second.

01:13:52.842 --> 01:13:55.203
- Michael, the greatest battle

01:13:55.204 --> 01:13:57.012
is then one that happens within.

01:13:57.013 --> 01:13:58.599
You need the loss, Michael.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.720
Through the loss, through the fire,

01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:04.300
you'll be forged into the
warrior who you truly are.

01:14:04.301 --> 01:14:06.022
- He left this for you.

01:14:06.023 --> 01:14:07.369
Just for you.

01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:08.943
- Quiet the thoughts, the mind,

01:14:08.944 --> 01:14:11.039
and that is where life happens.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.867
That's where victory happens.

01:14:12.868 --> 01:14:14.810
That's where happiness happens,

01:14:14.811 --> 01:14:17.989
and that's where loves happens.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.366
- LeMaster, he, um,

01:14:20.367 --> 01:14:22.242
he left something for me.

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:35.754
- It suits you.

01:14:37.347 --> 01:14:38.626
The name.

01:14:38.627 --> 01:14:39.710
It suits you.

01:14:42.536 --> 01:14:43.536
LeMaster?

01:14:45.221 --> 01:14:46.388
- Lion Killer.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.017
- You're late.

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:51.740
- I'm here now.

01:14:53.985 --> 01:14:54.985
- I'm glad.

01:14:56.469 --> 01:14:57.469
- Me too.

01:15:04.427 --> 01:15:05.760
So, how ya been?

01:15:08.763 --> 01:15:10.064
- Well.

01:15:10.065 --> 01:15:14.232
