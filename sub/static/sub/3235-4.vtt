00:05.849 --> 00:08.356
I made a copy for you
in case you're interested.

00:08.491 --> 00:10.926
It pertains to some
methamphetamine superlab.

00:11.025 --> 00:12.818
Money!

00:14.814 --> 00:17.130
What are we saying
is the source of this money?

00:17.227 --> 00:19.953
Walt came up with a story
about gambling winnings.

00:20.058 --> 00:21.766
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting.

00:21.918 --> 00:24.028
Actually that was Skyler's idea.

00:24.127 --> 00:25.173
I think you are
behind all this.

00:25.255 --> 00:26.862
When the others find out
what you've done,

Gambling destroyed my life--

05:38.180 --> 05:42.650
Me, my family,
everything I loved.

05:42.684 --> 05:47.254
It was like a robbery,
only I was the thief.

05:47.288 --> 05:49.922
It's amazing, the stories
you tell yourself

05:49.957 --> 05:51.390
to justify it--

05:51.425 --> 05:56.362
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand,

05:56.396 --> 05:57.797
one more spin,

05:57.832 --> 06:00.567
one more roll of the dice.

06:01.803 --> 06:03.637
This is our deal, okay?

06:03.672 --> 06:05.840
Marie, no.

06:05.874 --> 06:08.777
You guys are not lifting
a finger. I mean it.

06:08.812 --> 06:10.346
Yeah, we're bringing
everything, so--

06:10.380 --> 06:13.549
This-- This is not
up for debate, okay?

06:13.584 --> 06:15.485
Great.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.287
Now, sweetie,
don't worry, okay?

06:17.322 --> 06:19.022
We're not going to say
one word about the bills.

06:19.056 --> 06:21.492
We just want to bring
everyone up to speed, okay?

06:21.526 --> 06:23.260
All right.
I'll see you soon.

06:23.294 --> 06:24.294
Bye.

06:30.135 --> 06:31.803
So...

06:31.837 --> 06:34.105
tonight's the night.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.307
No turning back.

06:37.677 --> 06:38.944
Well...

06:38.978 --> 06:40.345
Okay.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.880
Let's do this.

06:43.717 --> 06:46.820
Okay, so first I assign
point values,

06:46.854 --> 06:49.422
correlate
to the effect of removal.

06:49.457 --> 06:51.124
You going to split the 8s?

06:51.159 --> 06:53.027
Skyler, please.

06:53.061 --> 06:55.729
Now,
the mathematical principle,

06:55.764 --> 06:57.798
known as the Kelly Criterion,

06:57.833 --> 07:00.233
upon which I devised
my own strategy

07:00.268 --> 07:01.869
not dissimilar
to the MIT system.

07:01.903 --> 07:04.905
Walt, you're not teaching them.

07:04.939 --> 07:07.007
I thought you wanted me
to be thorough.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.541
Just play.
You're taking too long.

07:08.576 --> 07:10.576
What, you don't think
it behooves me

07:10.611 --> 07:12.178
to be able to explain
any of this?

07:12.212 --> 07:14.180
It behooves you to be a pro,
that's all I'm saying.

07:14.214 --> 07:15.948
That's the fiction,
so chop-chop.

07:15.983 --> 07:18.951
Don't chop-chop me.

07:18.986 --> 07:20.019
Walt.

07:20.053 --> 07:22.889
Now, we both know
that the first decision

07:22.923 --> 07:26.859
is whether or not to split
or surrender on 8s.

07:26.893 --> 07:28.393
Split 'em.
Mm-hmm.

07:29.729 --> 07:31.463
Good on both.

07:31.498 --> 07:34.399
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

07:34.434 --> 07:35.467
What you should be doing.

07:35.502 --> 07:37.903
On 11, yes. Double.

07:37.937 --> 07:40.072
Okay, this hand over here,

07:40.106 --> 07:41.440
we have a soft 18.

07:41.474 --> 07:43.409
The final decision
is whether or not

07:43.443 --> 07:44.610
is to hit or to stand.

07:44.644 --> 07:45.877
Hit it.

07:47.180 --> 07:49.081
Becomes a hard 15.

07:49.115 --> 07:50.148
Dealer has a 9.

07:50.183 --> 07:51.383
I see that.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.218
Hit it.

07:53.253 --> 07:54.820
Oh.

07:54.854 --> 07:57.189
Okay, let's see what I got.

07:58.758 --> 08:00.760
And 21.

08:00.794 --> 08:02.362
Damn.
Yep.

08:02.396 --> 08:03.429
Okay, this--

08:03.464 --> 08:04.764
The key thing to remember here

08:04.798 --> 08:07.333
is that it's not about
any one hand.

08:07.368 --> 08:10.069
The key is the number
of hands per hour.

08:10.104 --> 08:11.070
Ooh.

08:11.105 --> 08:13.106
Let's go again.

08:13.140 --> 08:16.676
Zero, minus 1.

08:16.711 --> 08:18.978
[muttering] Okay.

08:19.013 --> 08:20.079
[knock knock]

08:21.682 --> 08:22.816
Walt.

08:22.850 --> 08:25.318
It's not as if I don't
know how to play.

08:25.352 --> 08:27.754
I certainly
more than understand

08:27.788 --> 08:28.854
how to count cards.

08:28.889 --> 08:30.089
Let's just keep going, okay?

08:30.123 --> 08:32.424
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.460
Remember?

08:33.494 --> 08:35.495
I shouldn't even be playing.

08:35.529 --> 08:37.330
And that is the fiction

08:37.364 --> 08:39.599
that we should be sticking to.

08:39.633 --> 08:40.900
You know what?

08:43.337 --> 08:44.538
You're right.

08:45.707 --> 08:46.674
Yeah.

08:46.708 --> 08:48.275
- Wow.
- Okay.

08:48.310 --> 08:51.846
Um, we're not leaving
anything to chance.

08:51.881 --> 08:54.483
All right, let's get started.

08:54.517 --> 08:56.284
I've got a lot of, uh--

08:56.319 --> 08:58.220
Walt,

08:58.254 --> 09:00.421
we've got a lot
of ground to cover.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.756
What is this?

09:01.790 --> 09:03.358
We have to get
our stories straight.

09:03.392 --> 09:05.093
We've got to be
on the same page.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.261
Is this a script?

09:06.295 --> 09:07.329
Bullet points.

09:07.363 --> 09:08.963
Bullet points?

09:08.998 --> 09:10.599
Like a novella.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.067
This is smart.

09:12.101 --> 09:14.269
You really want to try
to sell a DEA agent

09:14.303 --> 09:16.271
some ill-prepared,

09:16.305 --> 09:17.872
half-assed,
full-of-holes story

09:17.907 --> 09:19.407
about how we suddenly
have enough money

09:19.442 --> 09:20.575
to buy a car wash?

09:20.609 --> 09:21.843
Am I supposed to memorize this?

09:21.877 --> 09:23.611
We need to practice, Walt. Yeah.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.547
We need to be
word-perfect.

09:25.581 --> 09:26.548
Within reason.

09:26.582 --> 09:27.749
We need this story to be solid

09:27.783 --> 09:28.917
and sympathetic

09:28.951 --> 09:30.853
and most of all
completely believable.

09:30.887 --> 09:33.322
From a story that you
already told Marie

09:33.356 --> 09:35.691
and you think that she
hasn't told Hank?

09:35.726 --> 09:38.394
Ha! Come on. This is Marie
we're talking about here.

09:38.429 --> 09:39.429
No, she hasn't.

09:39.463 --> 09:40.463
[scoff]

09:40.498 --> 09:42.032
She hasn't.

09:42.066 --> 09:44.802
Hank thinks his insurance
is paying for everything.

09:44.836 --> 09:46.237
Marie's not telling him

09:46.271 --> 09:48.073
that we're paying
his therapy bills,

09:48.107 --> 09:49.307
and neither are we.

09:49.341 --> 09:50.408
And why is that again?

09:50.443 --> 09:51.743
Really?

09:51.778 --> 09:54.713
If we have
the gambling story...

09:57.016 --> 09:59.084
Did you take money, Walt?

09:59.118 --> 10:00.919
You remember
Gretchen and Elliot?

10:00.953 --> 10:02.354
Because I seem to recall

10:02.388 --> 10:04.390
that you'd rather
sell drugs than take help.

10:04.424 --> 10:05.724
Fine.

10:05.758 --> 10:07.559
Marie will tell Hank
in her own time,

10:07.593 --> 10:09.761
and at least we'll have
laid the groundwork.

10:09.796 --> 10:12.597
And coming clean
with Hank and Jun--

10:14.766 --> 10:17.568
Appearing to come clean

10:17.602 --> 10:20.437
will be the best thing
for everyone.

10:20.471 --> 10:22.605
We talked about this, okay?

10:22.640 --> 10:23.806
We agreed about this.

10:23.841 --> 10:26.208
Yes, we did. It's just--

10:27.511 --> 10:28.544
What?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.313
Never mind. Just--

10:32.748 --> 10:33.848
Okay.

10:33.882 --> 10:36.518
So I really think

10:36.552 --> 10:38.520
we should tag team
the narrative, okay?

10:38.554 --> 10:41.056
We'll each be responsible

10:41.090 --> 10:42.423
for certain portions
of the story,

10:42.458 --> 10:44.492
and then we can, uh,
we can hand off

10:44.526 --> 10:45.760
so we don't leave anything out,

10:45.795 --> 10:47.596
and it'll seem
the most natural.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.431
Okay, so I'm going to launch

10:49.465 --> 10:51.200
with the exciting news

10:51.234 --> 10:53.702
that we are
buying a car wash--

10:53.736 --> 10:55.104
Yay.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.139
The next logical question

10:57.173 --> 10:58.373
Hank will probably ask

10:58.408 --> 10:59.942
is "Where are you
getting the money?"

10:59.976 --> 11:02.010
Hmm.
To which I'll say

11:02.045 --> 11:04.246
"We want to tell you
the whole story.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.414
"It's a doozy,

11:05.448 --> 11:07.616
so hold on
to your hats."

11:08.818 --> 11:09.918
Do you like that?

11:11.955 --> 11:13.155
Sure.

11:14.624 --> 11:16.224
It accomplishes two things.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.392
It keeps it light

11:17.426 --> 11:19.428
while letting them know
to expect something big.

11:19.462 --> 11:20.862
Uh-huh.

11:21.864 --> 11:23.765
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

11:23.800 --> 11:24.766
Hmm.

11:24.801 --> 11:26.001
Okay.

11:26.035 --> 11:28.437
Anyway, that's where
you will take over,

11:28.471 --> 11:30.773
starting with your diagnosis,
pages 1 and 2.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.675
Okay, and it's--
It's pretty much

11:32.709 --> 11:34.243
going to run parallel
to the truth,

11:34.277 --> 11:35.344
which makes it easier,

11:35.378 --> 11:36.778
but, um...

11:36.813 --> 11:39.481
just make sure to really
hit the cancer,

11:39.515 --> 11:41.517
really touch
on the fear and despair.

11:41.551 --> 11:43.785
It's good to remind them

11:43.819 --> 11:45.720
and to get their sympathy
right off the bat.

11:45.754 --> 11:46.788
We want them to understand

11:46.822 --> 11:48.255
why you could do
something so stupid.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.690
Now, after that,

11:49.724 --> 11:51.258
per pages 3 and 4,

11:51.293 --> 11:54.494
after you say...

11:54.529 --> 11:56.363
"Gambling became an addiction,

11:56.397 --> 11:57.898
and I just
couldn't control it."

11:57.932 --> 11:59.533
Do you see that--
Yes.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.168
Right there in the
middle of the page? Okay.

12:01.202 --> 12:03.103
Oh, and I put in
that line about robbery.

12:03.137 --> 12:04.571
You know,
from the G.A. meeting?

12:04.606 --> 12:05.639
I thought that was good.

12:05.674 --> 12:07.308
So next I'll chime in

12:07.342 --> 12:08.843
about how it affected
our marriage,

12:08.878 --> 12:11.379
uh, starting with the,

12:11.414 --> 12:12.714
uh, the deceit,

12:12.749 --> 12:14.082
why we couldn't tell anyone.

12:14.117 --> 12:17.119
"...terribly, terribly
ashamed of my actions."

12:17.153 --> 12:18.320
Yeah.

12:18.355 --> 12:19.688
There's two "terriblys"?

12:19.722 --> 12:21.089
It's supposed
to show contrition.

12:21.124 --> 12:23.625
Well, I just wouldn't
use that word.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.361
I would never say
the word "terribly."

12:26.395 --> 12:28.663
Phrase it however
you want, okay?

12:28.697 --> 12:30.164
You're jumping ahead.
Now--

12:30.199 --> 12:33.834
And why--
Why am I so ashamed?

12:34.902 --> 12:37.003
Do I really need
to answer that?

12:38.139 --> 12:42.642
I was and am providing
for our family.

12:45.479 --> 12:47.780
Let's just pick up
where we left off.

12:47.815 --> 12:49.915
I'm weak,
and I'm out of control.

12:49.950 --> 12:51.984
I mean, this whole thing
makes me look like crap.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.387
This has to be
a warts-and-all story, Walt.

12:54.421 --> 12:56.689
That's how we'll sell it,
and we both look bad.

12:56.723 --> 12:59.125
Oh, well-- How do you
look bad exactly?

12:59.159 --> 13:02.228
Where is the "I slept
with my boss" bullet point?

13:02.263 --> 13:04.431
I can't seem to find that
anywhere.

13:04.465 --> 13:08.202
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth,

13:08.236 --> 13:10.638
I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

13:10.672 --> 13:11.939
I don't like it.

13:11.973 --> 13:14.208
I don't want Junior
thinking less of me.

13:14.242 --> 13:15.476
At least you won at gambling.

13:15.510 --> 13:16.877
I'm just the bitch mom

13:16.911 --> 13:19.412
who wouldn't cut you any slack.

13:26.253 --> 13:27.687
I'm sorry.

13:29.523 --> 13:32.257
I'm sorry that I put you
through all of this.

13:35.461 --> 13:38.096
How's that sound? Hmm?

13:38.130 --> 13:39.130
Here.

13:43.002 --> 13:44.402
Two "sorrys."

13:46.438 --> 13:48.940
I believe we were on page 5.

13:48.974 --> 13:52.076
So, after you say
how very sorry you are--

13:52.111 --> 13:54.545
In your own words,
of course--

13:54.580 --> 13:56.314
We're almost to the end,

13:56.349 --> 13:58.850
and I say how proud I am of you

13:58.885 --> 14:00.752
for joining
a 12-step program,

14:00.786 --> 14:04.255
and-- And this is where
I think we should enact

14:04.290 --> 14:06.191
how we're feeling, you know?

14:06.225 --> 14:08.326
Just a--
Just a suggestion.

14:08.361 --> 14:12.831
You might look down
on the floor with remorse.

14:12.866 --> 14:14.266
Hmm?

14:16.937 --> 14:20.007
What? You don't
have to mean it.

14:20.041 --> 14:22.342
You just stare down
at your feet, Walt, okay?

14:22.377 --> 14:24.745
Then, uh, I'm gonna--

14:24.780 --> 14:27.081
I was thinking
of taking Marie's hand

14:27.116 --> 14:29.384
and saying something emotional

14:29.418 --> 14:32.554
like "It's such a relief
to tell you.

14:32.588 --> 14:34.423
"We're just so glad
we have a strong family

14:34.457 --> 14:35.490
"to help us through this,

14:35.525 --> 14:37.191
that we can all support
each other."

14:37.226 --> 14:41.396
And then maybe
I'll tear up a little.

14:41.430 --> 14:42.931
I don't know.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.033
I'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

14:46.368 --> 14:48.670
You're going to cry?
On cue?

14:48.704 --> 14:51.205
I said I don't know.
Maybe.

14:51.239 --> 14:53.240
When you dab your eyes,
you going to do it

14:53.275 --> 14:54.808
with your right hand
or your left?

14:54.842 --> 14:55.709
It's just an idea.
One tear? Two tears?

14:55.743 --> 14:57.678
This has to be convincing,

14:57.712 --> 14:59.146
especially to Hank.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.382
I'm doing the best
I can here, Walt.

15:01.416 --> 15:03.251
And yes, I'm thorough.

15:04.753 --> 15:08.056
Maybe lying doesn't
come as easily to me

15:08.091 --> 15:09.558
as it does to you.

15:24.807 --> 15:25.774
[door opens]

15:25.808 --> 15:27.342
Hey!
Guys! Come on in.

15:27.376 --> 15:28.943
Hi. Good to see you.

15:28.977 --> 15:31.412
Hey. Put her there,
you little punk.

15:31.446 --> 15:32.613
Hi.
Hey.

15:32.647 --> 15:33.747
Great to see you, Hank.

15:33.781 --> 15:34.848
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

15:34.882 --> 15:36.049
Oh, look at my little princess.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.250
She's getting big, huh?

15:37.285 --> 15:38.952
An heavy, too.

15:38.987 --> 15:40.921
Whoa, is that actual
food I'm smelling?

15:40.956 --> 15:42.923
I might get an honest-to-God
meal here for once?

15:42.958 --> 15:44.024
You look good.

15:44.059 --> 15:45.193
Thank you, sweetheart.

15:45.227 --> 15:46.494
Your aunt Marie, she's cute,

15:46.529 --> 15:47.562
but she could burn water,

15:47.596 --> 15:48.630
you know what I'm saying?

15:48.664 --> 15:50.699
You are so very hilarious.

15:50.734 --> 15:52.368
Go show the boys
your new rock collection.

15:52.402 --> 15:53.770
We're going to get things
organized.

15:53.804 --> 15:55.071
Yeah, it'll be
about 10 minutes.

15:55.106 --> 15:56.139
You have a rock collection?

15:56.174 --> 15:57.774
It's a mineral collection.

15:57.809 --> 15:59.376
Uh, just a little
something I--

15:59.410 --> 16:01.045
You guys want to see it?
Want to see it?

16:01.079 --> 16:02.313
Sure.
Let's go see it.

16:02.347 --> 16:03.514
Oh, hey, let me.

16:03.548 --> 16:05.950
Hey, it's all right.
I got it.

16:07.319 --> 16:09.386
Come on, guys,
it's down the hall here.

16:12.390 --> 16:14.759
Now that one there,
that's Rhodonite, okay?

16:14.793 --> 16:16.661
It's manganese inosilicate.

16:16.695 --> 16:18.296
[Walt Junior] Cool.

16:18.330 --> 16:20.331
What-- What makes it
be all pink like that?

16:20.366 --> 16:22.334
Well, that's
the manganese part, okay?

16:22.368 --> 16:25.237
It-- It oxidizes,
you know, like rust.

16:25.271 --> 16:26.939
Exactly. Manganese can
have an oxidation state

16:26.973 --> 16:29.408
of between -3 and +7,

16:29.443 --> 16:31.677
which takes it through
a range of colors--

16:31.712 --> 16:32.845
Purple, green, blue.

16:32.879 --> 16:35.215
But its most stable state
is +2,

16:35.249 --> 16:37.617
which is usually pale pink.

16:38.852 --> 16:41.153
So...

16:41.188 --> 16:44.189
Exactly. Whatever
the hell he said.

16:44.223 --> 16:48.460
Anyway, you, uh,
you get the idea.

16:48.494 --> 16:50.896
[Walt]
Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.

16:50.930 --> 16:52.864
Interesting stuff, that.

16:52.898 --> 16:54.099
Really.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.704
Oh, hey, uh,

16:59.739 --> 17:02.273
here. Give me
that file, will you?

17:02.307 --> 17:04.276
You got to check this out.

17:04.310 --> 17:07.311
I, uh, have been working
on something here.

17:07.347 --> 17:09.548
Been a little, uh,
little consulting--

17:09.582 --> 17:12.984
You know, weighing in
on a case for APD.

17:13.019 --> 17:14.319
[chuckling]

17:14.354 --> 17:16.321
Put that in, will you?

17:16.357 --> 17:18.391
Put that in over there.

17:18.425 --> 17:21.627
Uh, Hank, what is this?
It's not a dead body--

17:21.662 --> 17:23.696
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

17:23.732 --> 17:26.200
You guys-- Seriously,
you got to check this out.

17:26.233 --> 17:27.601
This is good. Ready?

17:27.636 --> 17:29.103
Here we go on here.

18:15.395 --> 18:19.999

that we can all

[sniffle]

18:23.737 --> 18:25.438
Jesus.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.173
I don't even know where--

18:27.207 --> 18:29.141
Holy shit.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.143
Yeah.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.747
Walter H. Whyte.

18:34.782 --> 18:37.317
Man of hidden talents.

18:37.351 --> 18:41.054
Dad, you're such a stud.

18:41.088 --> 18:43.623
How much did you win exactly?

18:45.459 --> 18:47.027
Dad?

18:47.061 --> 18:49.596
I-- I don't think
I have exact figures.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.064
It's, uh,
it's enough to--

18:51.098 --> 18:52.799
Uh, after taxes,
of course--

18:52.833 --> 18:54.468
To buy the car wash.

18:54.502 --> 18:57.972
Maybe even pay for

18:58.006 --> 19:00.975
a couple of halfway
reasonable college educations.

19:01.009 --> 19:04.378
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

19:04.413 --> 19:08.916
I can totally get a car
for my birthday now.

19:08.950 --> 19:10.518
Right?

19:13.855 --> 19:16.390
Son, I'm...

19:16.424 --> 19:20.661
terribly, terrible
ashamed of my actions.

19:22.163 --> 19:24.365
Would you excuse me, please?

19:24.399 --> 19:26.267
I need to use the restroom.

19:32.340 --> 19:33.474
Wow.

19:56.766 --> 19:57.866
[Hank] Walt?

20:08.644 --> 20:09.944
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

20:09.978 --> 20:11.712
Oh. Sorry. I--

20:11.746 --> 20:13.380
I thought you might
have fallen in there.

20:13.415 --> 20:16.683
Uh, no, no. I just, uh--

20:16.718 --> 20:19.654
Hey, man, that was
some big stuff back there.

20:21.423 --> 20:24.326
Yeah, we wanted
to be thorough, so--

20:24.361 --> 20:27.263
Yeah, well, it's quite a tale.

20:27.297 --> 20:31.735
It couldn't have been
easy to talk about.

20:34.038 --> 20:36.073
You know, Walt, if you...

20:36.107 --> 20:38.742
you can always
bend my ear, right?

20:38.777 --> 20:40.611
I mean, if you ever
need to talk or--

20:40.645 --> 20:42.380
Or just blow off some steam.

20:42.414 --> 20:44.849
I'm-- I'm here.

20:46.685 --> 20:48.352
Not going anywhere.

20:50.355 --> 20:51.455
Thanks, Hank.

20:56.127 --> 20:57.661
Same goes for me, you know.

20:57.695 --> 21:00.698
If you ever want to bounce
anything off me.

21:00.732 --> 21:05.103
I don't know, case work,
anything, really.

21:05.137 --> 21:07.906
Sometimes just talking
something through,

21:07.940 --> 21:09.942
you know, really
can make a difference.

21:11.611 --> 21:13.045
[Hank] I mean, we're
definitely not talking,

21:13.079 --> 21:14.313
you know, bathtub crank here.

21:14.347 --> 21:16.715
This is a big-ass
operation.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.851
You know, hundreds
of pounds a week,

21:18.885 --> 21:20.653
maybe more.

21:20.687 --> 21:22.821
So, uh...

21:22.856 --> 21:26.892
who is this person?
What do you know about him?

21:26.926 --> 21:29.461
Other than the fact that he's
deader than a Texas salad bar

21:29.496 --> 21:30.996
and has a decent set of pipes?

21:31.031 --> 21:32.898
I'd say he's my guy.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.201
Your guy?

21:37.303 --> 21:38.571
There's this, uh, mystery man

21:38.605 --> 21:40.272
I've been, uh, chasing

21:40.306 --> 21:42.708
for the better part of a year.

21:42.742 --> 21:45.144
Cooks the purest meth

21:45.178 --> 21:48.314
that, uh, me or anyone
else has ever seen.

21:49.649 --> 21:51.650
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

21:54.220 --> 21:55.454
Hmm.

21:55.489 --> 21:56.689
Yeah.
Pretty weird, huh?

21:56.723 --> 21:58.992
I-- I--
I looked him up.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.193
It, uh, it was one
of these physicists--

22:00.227 --> 22:01.494
One of Hitler's guys,

22:01.528 --> 22:03.196
a physicist
named Werner Heisenberg.

22:03.230 --> 22:05.731
[chuckles] Real cute, huh?

22:05.765 --> 22:07.734
Anyway, I figure
with a handle like that,

22:07.768 --> 22:09.669
you know, my guy's got to be

22:09.704 --> 22:11.871
some sort of an egghead.
No offense.

22:11.905 --> 22:13.672
And here we go--

22:13.707 --> 22:16.642
Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

22:16.677 --> 22:18.911
Anyway, I-- I--
I just want to see

22:18.945 --> 22:22.014
if I'm, you know, not
barking up the wrong tree

22:22.049 --> 22:23.383
chemically speaking.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.618
Uh, as far as I can make out,

22:25.652 --> 22:30.189
he's writing about
phenylacetone cook, right?

22:31.624 --> 22:32.858
Yeah.

22:32.892 --> 22:34.960
Yeah. That's pretty
rare these days,

22:34.994 --> 22:36.494
but it-- It does jive

22:36.529 --> 22:37.996
with the blue stuff
I've been tracking.

22:38.030 --> 22:40.566
"2 sticks dairy free
soy margarine,

22:40.600 --> 22:43.236
2/3 cup turbinado sugar"?

22:43.270 --> 22:44.371
[laughing]

22:44.405 --> 22:47.107
It's a recipe
for vegan s'mores.

22:47.141 --> 22:50.244
Hmm. There's all kinds
of crazy crap in there.

22:50.278 --> 22:51.312
Yeah, like, uh, you know,

22:51.346 --> 22:53.515
top ten recumbent bicycles,

22:53.549 --> 22:55.049
indoor composting tips.

22:55.084 --> 22:56.551
All right next to the--

22:56.585 --> 23:00.588
The mother of, uh, of
methamphetamine synthesis.

23:00.623 --> 23:02.490
This guy was a, uh--

23:02.524 --> 23:05.360
Man, he was a real character.

23:05.394 --> 23:08.896
Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.

23:08.931 --> 23:10.598
Here, let me-- Let me--
Let me show you something.

23:10.632 --> 23:11.732
Give it-- Give it.

23:14.703 --> 23:16.304
Right here at the, uh--

23:16.338 --> 23:21.475
And here's the top.
It says, uh, "To W.W.

23:21.510 --> 23:23.979
My star,
my perfect silence."

23:24.013 --> 23:24.980
Huh.

23:25.014 --> 23:27.516
W.W. [laughing]

23:27.550 --> 23:30.319
I mean, who do you
figure that is, huh?

23:30.354 --> 23:33.190
Woodrow Wilson?

23:33.224 --> 23:35.258
Willy Wonka?

23:37.795 --> 23:39.496
Walter Whyte?

23:39.530 --> 23:41.031
[chuckle]

23:42.733 --> 23:44.000
You got me.

23:47.171 --> 23:49.539
W.W.

23:49.573 --> 23:51.974
Hey, man, let me see this...

23:53.644 --> 23:56.145
for a second because
I think I remembered...

23:56.180 --> 23:58.948
Ah. Here.

23:58.982 --> 24:01.117
Yes.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.321
Yeah.

24:04.355 --> 24:07.024
"When I heard
the learn'd astronomer..."

24:07.059 --> 24:09.894
Learned.
"And from time to time

24:09.929 --> 24:12.631
"looked up in perfect silence

24:12.665 --> 24:14.767
at the stars."

24:14.801 --> 24:18.336
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

24:18.371 --> 24:20.405
Your W.W.

24:21.573 --> 24:23.941
You frickin' braniac.

24:23.976 --> 24:25.710
Ha.
You frickin' braniac.

24:25.745 --> 24:27.179
Ha ha ha!

24:27.213 --> 24:29.414
I must have skipped that day
in school or something.

24:29.448 --> 24:30.982
I don't know.
Hee hee!

24:31.016 --> 24:33.117
I've been chasing my tail
about that one, you know?

24:33.152 --> 24:34.085
I bet you're right.

24:34.119 --> 24:36.354
Well, I'm glad
I could be of help.

24:36.388 --> 24:39.891
Yeah.
Walt Whitman, huh.

24:39.925 --> 24:44.096
So, uh, you think
this Gale person

24:44.130 --> 24:45.497
is your Heisenberg?

24:45.532 --> 24:47.867
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.

24:47.901 --> 24:49.701
God, I wanted to get this guy.

24:52.539 --> 24:54.006
It looks like you did.

24:54.040 --> 24:57.744
No, I mean, you know,
me personally.

24:57.778 --> 25:00.380
I wanted to be the one
to slap the handcuffs on him,

25:00.414 --> 25:02.182
that kind of shit.

25:02.216 --> 25:05.352
Popeye Doyle
waving to Frog One.

25:08.223 --> 25:09.823
If I recall,

25:09.858 --> 25:12.426
<i>at least from the first
French Connection,</i>

25:12.461 --> 25:16.430
Popeye Doyle never
actually caught him.

25:16.465 --> 25:17.464
Ha.

25:18.567 --> 25:21.870
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

25:21.904 --> 25:23.938
A day late and a dollar short.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.113
What about the person
who killed him?

25:32.148 --> 25:34.582
APD's problem, not mine.

25:34.617 --> 25:35.850
Any leads?

25:35.885 --> 25:37.285
My buddy Tim says

25:37.320 --> 25:38.953
he's got some fingerprints
they're trying to ID,

25:38.988 --> 25:41.456
and an eyewitness
saw a person of interest.

25:41.491 --> 25:42.758
Might get lucky there.

25:42.792 --> 25:43.959
I guess somebody
knows something.

25:43.993 --> 25:46.762
They'll track down
the shooter eventually.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.265
Jesse!

25:52.503 --> 25:53.970
Excuse me.

25:54.005 --> 25:55.371
[grunting]

25:55.406 --> 25:56.706
<i>♪ [rap]</i>

26:11.520 --> 26:12.621
[crack]

26:18.161 --> 26:19.494
Jesse?

26:19.528 --> 26:21.363
What's up?

26:30.574 --> 26:33.710
I need to talk to you, okay?

26:38.850 --> 26:41.084
Now.

26:41.118 --> 26:42.285
Go ahead.

26:45.755 --> 26:49.558
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

26:49.592 --> 26:52.427
When I'm done, yo,
that dude's next.

26:54.763 --> 26:55.730
[buzzing stops]

26:55.764 --> 26:57.165
What the hell?
What is wrong--

26:57.199 --> 26:59.801
I have some business
to discuss.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.671
So discuss. Jesus.

27:02.706 --> 27:03.973
Let go of me.

27:04.007 --> 27:06.208
Gale's murder is
being investigated.

27:06.243 --> 27:08.144
Uh, duh.

27:08.178 --> 27:09.612
And I have it on good authority

27:09.647 --> 27:12.483
that they found
fingerprints at the scene.

27:12.517 --> 27:14.218
Not mine.

27:16.054 --> 27:17.555
We done here?

27:17.590 --> 27:18.957
No, we are not done here.

27:18.991 --> 27:20.625
What if they are yours?

27:20.660 --> 27:21.893
How can you be so sure?

27:21.928 --> 27:23.795
Because I'm here, all right?

27:23.829 --> 27:25.830
Your brother-in-law's
got such a hardon for me

27:25.864 --> 27:27.498
that if the cops would have
found my fingerprints--

27:27.532 --> 27:28.899
Shh.

27:28.934 --> 27:30.367
The cops would have
found my fingerprints

27:30.401 --> 27:31.634
within five blocks
of that place,

27:31.669 --> 27:33.670
they would have
picked me up by now.

27:34.738 --> 27:36.572
What about the casing?

27:36.607 --> 27:38.875
Or casings? How--

27:38.909 --> 27:41.411
How many times did you
shoot him anyway?

27:42.880 --> 27:47.084
Jesse, did you pick up
the casings?

27:47.119 --> 27:49.720
Did you pick them up?

27:49.755 --> 27:50.922
No.

27:55.361 --> 27:57.729
Listen, uh, we've got
to go over this

27:57.764 --> 28:00.299
step by step--
Everything.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.367
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

28:02.402 --> 28:03.769
from the moment you got there.

28:03.803 --> 28:05.470
I got in, I got out.

28:05.504 --> 28:08.673
No. No, I need to know
specifics.

28:08.707 --> 28:10.407
Now, we'll start
from the beginning.

28:10.442 --> 28:12.743
You-- You drove there.
You drove over there.

28:12.777 --> 28:14.511
You went to his door, right?

28:16.881 --> 28:19.249
Jesse,
I need you to concentrate.

28:19.284 --> 28:20.250
This is very important.

28:20.285 --> 28:21.719
Did you knock or ring?

28:21.753 --> 28:24.321
Knock or ring?
Uhh!

28:24.356 --> 28:25.823
Knock.

28:25.857 --> 28:27.992
Okay, good.
That's very good.

28:28.026 --> 28:29.727
Now listen.

28:29.761 --> 28:31.962
I assume that Gale
answered the door.

28:31.997 --> 28:33.263
Now what happened after that?

28:33.298 --> 28:34.765
Did he recognize you?

28:34.799 --> 28:36.968
Did you say anything
to each other?

28:37.002 --> 28:38.336
Did you walk into the room,

28:38.371 --> 28:41.106
or did you shoot him
right then and there?

28:41.140 --> 28:42.140
What?

28:44.443 --> 28:46.945
Who wants to make
a hundred bucks?

28:46.979 --> 28:48.180
Huh?

29:04.176 --> 29:06.010
Look, the kid's probably right.

29:06.044 --> 29:08.078
If they had anything on him,

29:08.113 --> 29:09.847
he'd be locked up already.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.682
What about
my brother-in-law?

29:11.716 --> 29:13.218
He suspects Jess--

29:13.252 --> 29:15.353
Hell, he knows Jesse
is involved

29:15.387 --> 29:17.389
in the sale of blue meth.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.859
That was Hank's
one and only lead.

29:20.894 --> 29:23.395
Now what if he puts
2 and 2 together

29:23.430 --> 29:25.631
and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

29:25.665 --> 29:28.133
He goes after him how,
on his Rascal Scooter?

29:29.769 --> 29:32.904
Ahem. That, perhaps,
sounded insensitive.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.507
Uh, but if he goes after him,

29:35.541 --> 29:38.075
I'll sue his ass
for police brutality,

29:38.109 --> 29:40.744
harassment, assault,
and 16 other things.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.879
Now, the history that
those two have together

29:42.913 --> 29:44.147
being what it is,

29:44.181 --> 29:45.682
you got to figure
your brother-in-law's

29:45.717 --> 29:48.485
smart enough not to go
down that particular road.

29:48.519 --> 29:50.888
Goose egg, bupkis--

29:50.922 --> 29:52.590
That's what the cops got.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.892
I wouldn't worry about it.

29:54.927 --> 29:58.430
What else should I not
worry about, Saul, hmm?

29:58.465 --> 30:01.133
Should I not worry
that Gus plans to murder me

30:01.168 --> 30:02.568
at the first chance he gets?

30:02.603 --> 30:04.837
Should I not worry
that my drug-addicted partner

30:04.872 --> 30:07.273
doesn't seem to care
whether he lives or dies?

30:07.307 --> 30:09.474
You should see his house.

30:09.509 --> 30:12.444
It's-- It's like Skid Row.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.647
He has actual hobos
living there.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.515
Now how long before Gus decides

30:17.550 --> 30:19.316
that he's too big of a risk?

30:19.351 --> 30:21.018
Geez, that Mike,

30:21.052 --> 30:24.488
that grunting
dead-eyed cretin

30:24.522 --> 30:27.024
sucker-punching me
in the-- In the face.

30:27.058 --> 30:29.526
I've got Gus
wielding a box cutter.

30:29.561 --> 30:33.597
I mean, Western Union--
Message received.

30:35.199 --> 30:36.266
It--

30:36.301 --> 30:37.968
Let me ask you.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.672
When did this stop
being a business, hmm?

30:41.706 --> 30:43.307
Why am I the only person

30:43.341 --> 30:45.877
capable of behaving
in a professional manner?

30:47.379 --> 30:48.345
No, I--

30:49.547 --> 30:53.750
No, any way you slice it,
everyone's in danger.

30:55.085 --> 30:58.321
I mean, how--
How can I protect anyone?

30:58.355 --> 31:01.023
My family, Jesse, myself?

31:01.058 --> 31:05.294
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

31:07.697 --> 31:12.336
Meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.540
Oh. Yeah.
That ship has sailed.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.508
Bon voyage.

31:17.543 --> 31:18.777
We are committed.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.912
We already told
our family about it,

31:20.947 --> 31:24.015
and now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes--

31:24.050 --> 31:25.784
She needs to believe

31:25.818 --> 31:28.453
that everything
is neat and tidy,

31:28.488 --> 31:29.821
and she's telling herself

31:29.856 --> 31:33.058
that I work in this nice
quiet little lab

31:33.092 --> 31:35.193
with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector

31:35.228 --> 31:37.062
and when my contract is up

31:37.096 --> 31:38.696
I'll just simply
hang it all up,

31:38.731 --> 31:40.798
tip my hat, and walk away.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.804
Oh, God.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.342
How did everything
get so screwed up?

31:52.646 --> 31:55.748
Yeah, you do have a little
shit creek action happening.

32:03.891 --> 32:08.928
You know, FYI,
you can buy a paddle.

32:10.697 --> 32:13.533
This is a last resort
back pocket kind of thing,

32:13.567 --> 32:15.802
but if you really
got to protect yourself,

32:15.837 --> 32:18.572
uh...disappear.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.441
Poof.

32:22.710 --> 32:23.877
Poof?

32:23.911 --> 32:26.345
There's a guy
who can make it happen.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.415
Call him a, uh...

32:28.449 --> 32:30.516
disappearer.

32:30.551 --> 32:34.354
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial,

32:34.388 --> 32:38.358
you and your loved ones
can vanish, untraceable.

32:38.392 --> 32:41.261
I mean, he sets you up
with a whole new life.

32:41.296 --> 32:43.630
What, like a...

32:43.665 --> 32:46.467
witness protection
kind of thing?

32:46.501 --> 32:48.969
Beyond.
I mean, off the grid.

32:49.004 --> 32:51.004
New identities, new everything.

32:51.039 --> 32:53.641
No one would ever
be able to trace you.

32:53.675 --> 32:56.844
Now, be clear,
this is an end game,

32:56.878 --> 32:58.012
if you get my meaning.

32:58.046 --> 32:59.680
I mean, there's no coming back.

32:59.714 --> 33:01.348
[sigh]

33:04.653 --> 33:05.619
Sh--

33:05.654 --> 33:07.187
You want his card?

33:11.826 --> 33:13.260
Ahh.

33:13.295 --> 33:16.430
God, there's got to be
something else that I could do.

33:17.966 --> 33:20.967
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

33:21.002 --> 33:22.636
Well, I mean,
from what you told me,

33:22.670 --> 33:25.138
it sounds like, uh,
Pinkman is first up

33:25.172 --> 33:27.107
in the imminent demise
department.

33:30.145 --> 33:33.447
Gus won't risk letting
the police find Jesse.

33:33.481 --> 33:35.649
I know him. He won't.

33:58.173 --> 33:59.473
I'm not even kidding

33:59.508 --> 34:00.941
because if you really
think about it,

34:00.976 --> 34:02.176
you can't even see it,

34:02.210 --> 34:03.844
so how can you know
just how bad

34:03.879 --> 34:05.079
radio frequencies
and microwaves

34:05.113 --> 34:06.747
and cell phones and stuff
are getting you?

34:06.781 --> 34:08.415
I mean, you could be
strolling through security

34:08.449 --> 34:11.018
at the airport on the way
to visit your grandma or--

34:11.053 --> 34:12.587
Wake up, bitches!

34:12.621 --> 34:13.989
And then you get waved

34:14.023 --> 34:16.058
through a full-body
X-ray scanner,

34:16.092 --> 34:17.726
and the next day
you could be dead

34:17.760 --> 34:19.995
or dying from all the radiation
that they say is safe,

34:20.030 --> 34:21.297
but there's no way.

34:21.331 --> 34:22.965
It could be because
they have to deliver

34:22.998 --> 34:24.132
a concentrated dose, okay?

34:24.168 --> 34:25.568
Enough to penetrate
through clothes,

34:25.603 --> 34:26.735
and so the accumulated amount

34:26.770 --> 34:28.036
could definitely be dangerous

34:28.071 --> 34:29.371
to susceptible
individuals--

34:29.406 --> 34:30.639
Hey, yo.

34:30.672 --> 34:32.241
Especially if you're
from a rural area

34:32.275 --> 34:33.876
and the ozone layer's
already thin-- Yo.

34:33.909 --> 34:35.077
Because of the cow farts.

34:35.110 --> 34:36.445
Yo!

34:36.478 --> 34:37.780
Oh, hey.

34:37.813 --> 34:38.914
Will you make sure

34:38.947 --> 34:40.447
there's pizza here
when I get back?

34:40.483 --> 34:41.683
Enough for everybody.

34:41.717 --> 34:44.652
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I can do that.

34:44.687 --> 34:46.353
I can definitely do that.
All right?

34:46.388 --> 34:47.688
Not a problem, all right?

34:47.723 --> 34:49.757

gonna mess up--

Because, especially,

35:23.861 --> 35:25.929
if you have cancer,
and you know,

35:25.963 --> 35:29.399
because if you got to get
a bone marrow transplant,

35:29.433 --> 35:31.034
your odds are-- Are 60%.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.335
You have a 60% chance.

Aw, please, please.

What can I do for you?

41:08.585 --> 41:10.119
It's Pinkman.

41:10.153 --> 41:12.888
He's become increasingly
incautious.

41:12.923 --> 41:16.225
He's a risk, a liability.

I know he and Walter
come as a team

41:18.528 --> 41:20.830
