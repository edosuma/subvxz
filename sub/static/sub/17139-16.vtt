00:03.280 --> 00:04.805
DEAN: <i>You know, Claire,
if you go down this path,</i>

00:05.000 --> 00:06.445
<i>our path, it's not a long life.</i>

00:06.760 --> 00:08.922
I solemnly swear
not to hunt like a dumb-ass.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.566
Claire, do your homework
before you do anything stupid, okay?

00:11.760 --> 00:13.603
<i>And we're here if you need us, anytime.</i>

00:13.840 --> 00:16.764
Werewolves that are turned
up to four generations from pure blood

00:16.960 --> 00:21.443
are less feral and can transform before,
during and after the lunar cycle.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.966
<i>And the werewolves are badass.</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:25.965
The old men want the Winchesters,
so I made a play for Dean,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.482
<i>and it was working
until your operation went sideways.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:32.246
I'm in. You're changing the world.
And I want to be a part of it.

00:32.479 --> 00:35.450
Dean, because of Mick and his guys,
the Alpha vampire is dead.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.324
What do you want me to say?
Do I like it? No.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.290
Do I trust them? Hell, no.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.244
<i>We work with people
we don't trust all the time.</i>

00:41.560 --> 00:44.530
So if you wanna give this a shot,
then fine.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.403
Yeah, "seriously."

01:19.400 --> 01:20.686
You're so busted.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.402
You are beyond lame, you know that?

01:32.680 --> 01:35.160
Let's just go back. Please?

01:35.800 --> 01:38.770
I'll get you in. Ever had a Moscow Mule?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.525
A Moscow Mule?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.206
Can you just, for once, act your age?

01:45.680 --> 01:48.047
Says the guy
who doesn't even have his own car.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.331
Stop hounding Mom about buying us a car,
all right?

01:51.680 --> 01:53.284
She's doing the best she can.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.970
Two more years, I'm so gone.

01:57.960 --> 01:58.961
Hold up!

02:00.360 --> 02:01.407
Did you hear that?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.886
Yeah. They're called animals.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.969
- Let's just go back into town.
- No, Hayden. We're going.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.044
Have you, like, never seen a horror movie?

02:12.040 --> 02:15.931
Two kids, dark road,
creepy noise in the woods?

02:16.600 --> 02:18.568
We keep walking and boom!

02:18.840 --> 02:20.330
You are such a drama queen.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.724
- All right? There's nothing there.
- But I...

02:23.000 --> 02:24.809
No, fine. I'll prove it.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.882
Sucker.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.091
See? Told ya.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.766
Hayden!

03:06.000 --> 03:08.207
Hayden. Hayden. No.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.968
Oh, my God. Hey. Jesus.

03:11.280 --> 03:12.486
Help!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.044
Hayden. Hey. Hey, Hayden.

03:57.840 --> 03:58.966
All right, that's it.
I'm waiting in the car.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.326
Dean. Dude, wait a second.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.488
No, you know what? Getting jobs
from these dicks is one thing,

04:02.760 --> 04:04.683
but I didn't sign up
for this "reporting for duty" crap.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.769
- Especially when they're late.
- Sorry I'm late.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.529
My report to the home office ran long.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.485
We've had our hands full since...

04:17.600 --> 04:19.762
Well, best not to dwell on that.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.360
Wow, that is some world-class repression.
You are British.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.085
We prefer to call it a stiff upper lip.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.407
Okay. Okay, enough.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.128
Mick, what's the deal with the Bat-Signal?

04:32.200 --> 04:34.202
There was an incident in Wisconsin.
"Animal attack."

04:35.960 --> 04:37.724
A girl named Hayden Foster's
in the hospital,

04:37.960 --> 04:40.122
<i>and her brother lost his heart.</i>

04:40.280 --> 04:41.441
Looks like a werewolf.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.569
Well, they don't usually
leave behind survivors.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.406
Freak probably got spooked
before he could finish the job.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.881
Perhaps.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.562
But it usually takes more than a fright to
put your average werewolf off his supper.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.286
- Oh, you'd know that, would you?
- Actually, I would.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.281
I did extensive research
into lycanthropy at Kendricks.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.801
Kendricks?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.041
The Kendricks School.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.283
It's where the British Men of Letters
train their operatives.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.726
- It's like our...
- Hogwarts?

05:07.800 --> 05:08.881
Exactly.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.731
Kendricks has the largest collection
of occult lore in the world.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.241
Cool.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.723
So, when it comes to werewolves,
I'm not entirely ignorant.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.841
For example, we know that last night's
attack didn't happen on a full moon,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.765
- therefore we're looking for a pure-blood.
- You think?

05:25.640 --> 05:26.721
Looks like a milk run to me.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.930
Then you don't mind if I tag along.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.201
Mick.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.767
Urn, listen, I don't think hunting
is really your kind of thing.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.645
Well, then maybe it should be.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.085
I had the best team.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.763
But, most of us,
we were thinkers, not fighters.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.845
And let's be honest, you and your mum,
you're the only reason I'm still alive.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.281
So now, you wanna be like us?

05:51.520 --> 05:55.366
No, I just wanna be ready
for whatever's next.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.962
Dude, he is deadweight, and you know it.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.491
Look, Mick's inexperienced, sure.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.290
But these people have
some serious knowledge.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.530
So? Dude, what we do,
you can't learn this crap in a book.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.802
You put on a flannel, you pick up a gun,
you go out there.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.088
Either you get good fast,
or you get dead faster.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.489
We're working with these people now,
and we're getting wins.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.286
We're saving people.
The better they are, the better we are.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.890
Look, Mick held his own with the Alpha,

06:22.080 --> 06:23.650
why not give him a shot?
Maybe he'll come in handy.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.729
And what if he gets himself killed?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.843
- I heard that.
- Good.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.725
If he's coming, you're babysitting him.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.650
<i>In Luther's 27th thesis,</i>

06:41.920 --> 06:45.845
<i>the word "jingle" is an obvious nod
to a canny 15th century monk...</i>

06:46.320 --> 06:48.368
Had to let him listen to his podcast, huh?

06:48.800 --> 06:52.088
Dude, it's educational. And besides,
I've been wanting to listen to this one.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.442
You know, monks like Martin Luther
were among the earliest hunters.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.684
They even wrote
parts of that book you're holding.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.323
Wait, this lore dates back
to the 16th century?

07:01.560 --> 07:03.449
Yeah. Well, in Europe, everything's old.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.160
Though we do have our fair share
of new tricks for dealing with wolves.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.801
Sulfate gas,
silver nitrate lethal injection.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.685
Take a handful of silver bullets
over any of that fancy crap.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.607
Yes, well, thanks to that "fancy crap,".

07:15.840 --> 07:18.411
Britain's last werewolf outbreak
was in the '20s.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.361
We rooted them out,
bitten and pure-blood alike.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.524
Wait a second, you killed them all?
Even the ones that weren't hurting anyone?

07:24.760 --> 07:25.761
Sorry?

07:26.040 --> 07:27.849
I mean, werewolves
aren't like most monsters.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.082
Some can control it.
I mean, we have a buddy who got bit,

07:30.360 --> 07:31.521
nothing but beef hearts ever since.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.921
And you trust him?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.564
Well, killing is a fundamental need
for werewolves,

07:36.880 --> 07:38.928
and monsters
don't just stop being monsters.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.361
DEAN: <i>Well, Garth did.</i>

07:42.520 --> 07:43.681
Oh, turn here.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.845
- This place, uh, seems a little...
- Shabby?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.049
Yeah, three stars was the best I could do.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.449
At least our bean counters will be happy.
Booked us all suites.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.405
Wait you... We're in separate rooms?

08:13.520 --> 08:15.409
- Yeah, of course.
- Did you say "three stars"?

08:15.720 --> 08:16.721
Yeah.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.804
So, we talking fresh towels,
little baby shampoos?

08:20.040 --> 08:22.407
- Uh-huh. And I believe there's a pool.
- Welcome, sir.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.927
- Cheers, mate.
- Get the bags.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.441
Thanks.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.160
Man, those pillows, right?

08:49.440 --> 08:52.046
The little chocolates
that they put on 'em. I'm ruined, Sam.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.762
These Limey sons of bitches ruined me.
I even took a swim this morning.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.445
- You brought a swimsuit?
- No.

08:58.680 --> 08:59.681
Ugh.

09:00.760 --> 09:03.161
- What did you get up to?
- I read through more of Mick's lore books.

09:03.360 --> 09:06.284
Really?
Wow. Those three stars are wasted on you.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.524
Anyways, listen to this, it's crazy.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.250
So, apparently, back in the '30s,

09:10.480 --> 09:12.482
they were working
on this treatment for werewolves.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.604
- This, like, blood therapy...
- Plasma therapy.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.560
Useless, I'm afraid.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.081
So, how were your accommodations, lads?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.883
I've had better nights' sleep in my baby.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.725
Get in. Let's go.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.802
Not gonna give him the satisfaction.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.566
Wait, wait, let us.

09:59.040 --> 10:01.042
Talking to a grieving family,
it's tougher than you think.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.801
Well, I'm a quick study.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.840
Good for you. Okay, stay here, keep watch.
Anything comes up, I don't know, whistle.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.681
Ms. Foster?

10:14.280 --> 10:17.648
Sorry to bother you. Agent McVie,
this is my partner, Agent Fleetwood.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.330
Um, we'd like to ask your daughter
a few questions.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.407
- She's sleeping.
- We'll be quick. Promise.

10:23.680 --> 10:24.886
I said, "No."

10:29.200 --> 10:31.407
Hayden needs her rest, she's...

10:34.080 --> 10:36.845
Good morning,
and how is our patient today?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.725
I'm sorry, who are you?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.001
Dr. Buckingham.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.847
Hayden's attending, Dr., uh, Markham,
asked me to look in on her.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.400
Erm, would it be okay to ask you
just to step outside for a moment?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.560
I, um... of course, Doctor.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.082
- Sure.
- Thank you.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.321
Here, please.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.404
- Thank you.
- No problem.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.725
I'm sorry about all that.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.649
Oh, please.
After what you've been through,

11:08.800 --> 11:10.450
you have no reason to apologize.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.082
- Where's my mom?
- Your mum's just outside.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.283
Just gonna take a quick look,
make sure you're okay.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.965
Brave girl.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.089
I don't know what happened.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.530
- It was so fast.
- You've had quite a shock.

11:26.600 --> 11:30.082
I just... I don't even know
what my kids were doing out there.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.647
You know, Hayden was supposed to
be sleeping at her friend's house.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.371
And Ben...

11:38.080 --> 11:39.366
I'm sorry.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.688
I just keep thinking this is a nightmare.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.008
You know? That I'm gonna wake up.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.407
Okay.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.931
I'm just glad the FBI is here.
Not those crazies.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.362
- Crazies?
- Bigfoot truthers.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.408
Calling, sending emails.
I mean, they thought Hayden was...

12:05.960 --> 12:08.327
- Like I said, crazy.
- Huh.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.770
Some girl even came by here
saying she was from the...

12:12.160 --> 12:14.003
Fish and Wildlife Service.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.246
Barely as old as Hayden.
I mean, like I'm gonna buy that.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.010
You remember what she looked like?

12:23.280 --> 12:26.124
Yeah, blonde. With a bad attitude.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.162
I actually... I have her card right here.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.361
Okay.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.921
Um.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.041
What is this?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.842
Oh, no.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.651
Okay. You're okay.

12:52.520 --> 12:54.363
You relax, okay?

12:55.960 --> 12:56.961
Uh?

12:58.400 --> 12:59.401
Is she...

12:59.680 --> 13:01.569
Wounds healing up nicely.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.880
Nothing too serious.

13:04.120 --> 13:06.088
That's... Thank you so much.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.169
- Pleasure.
- Excuse me.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.362
- Doc?
- So?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.326
Was Hayden bit?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.683
No. No, she's a lucky girl.

13:20.920 --> 13:21.921
SAM: <i>Good.</i>

13:22.360 --> 13:24.567
What about,
uh, "Fish and Wildlife Service"?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.881
Think it's another hunter?

13:26.240 --> 13:29.210
Young, blonde, pissed off.
Sound like anybody we know?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.891
Hello? Uh, this is Agent Beatrice Quimby.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.122
DEAN:
<i>Oh, thank God. There's a bear.</i>

14:05.320 --> 14:06.845
<i>Uh, it's the size of a freaking tank.</i>

14:07.120 --> 14:09.282
<i>I think it wants my picnic basket.</i>

14:09.440 --> 14:10.601
Mmm-hmm.

14:10.920 --> 14:11.967
Hi, Dean.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.604
DEAN:
<i>So, Fish and Wildlife.</i>

14:14.920 --> 14:15.921
Really?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.770
Claire, what are you doing here?

14:18.120 --> 14:20.088
Same as you. Werewolf case.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.442
Now, beers all round.

14:22.760 --> 14:25.286
- Who are you?
- Mick Davies.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.170
Men of Letters. British.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.248
Long story.
And, like, <i>Downton Abbey</i> boring, so...

14:33.960 --> 14:34.961
No. Uh-uh.

14:38.680 --> 14:39.681
Okay.

14:40.480 --> 14:45.008
Anyway. I've been on this a day,
and guess what? The girl, Hayden...

14:45.280 --> 14:48.648
Her story about what happened
the night of the attack, one big lie.

14:48.840 --> 14:49.841
Her mom said the same thing.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.167
Where was she?

14:51.440 --> 14:53.602
She was at the local dive bar
getting trashed.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.849
I tracked her phone
and asked around and...

14:56.160 --> 14:58.481
Bartenders love me. It's a gift.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.044
Right. You get anything else?

15:01.320 --> 15:03.322
The guy I talked to was a scumbag.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.884
Tribal tat, motorcycle, grabby.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.287
Grabby?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.929
I'm a big girl. I handled it.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.322
Right. I think I'm gonna call it a night.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.610
Dude, it's 5:30.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.481
Yeah, but my report's due at 6:00 sharp.
All work, no play.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.127
Nice meeting ya.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.410
So, your foreign exchange student
is totally lame.

15:26.680 --> 15:30.127
Yeah, he's Sam's best friend.
They're like nerd soulmates.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.844
Anyway. Why are you alone?

15:34.200 --> 15:37.522
Jody's busy with sheriff stuff.
She said to call if I found anything.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.841
So you called her?

15:40.320 --> 15:41.321
You called first.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.600
And she's great, by the way.
And so is Alex.

15:44.880 --> 15:46.041
So, should we go to the morgue?

15:46.560 --> 15:48.528
Take it easy, Clarice. Morgue's closed.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.330
SAM: <i>By the way,
when's the last time you had a hot meal</i>

15:50.600 --> 15:52.887
that didn't come
from a Gas 'n Sip microwave?

15:53.240 --> 15:54.571
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.201
It's been awhile.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.401
Well...

16:01.400 --> 16:04.609
Go nuts. It's on, uh, Harry Potter.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.604
Cool.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.365
I'm sorry.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.161
No.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.808
BARBARA: <i>No!</i>

17:43.920 --> 17:46.002
<i>No!</i>

17:54.520 --> 17:57.490
Thanks for coming by so quickly.
Ms. Foster gave us your number.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.006
You have any idea what happened to her?

17:59.360 --> 18:01.010
Autopsy's tomorrow,

18:01.320 --> 18:03.322
<i>but it could be an arterial embolism,
cardiac arrest...</i>

18:03.600 --> 18:05.364
A heart attack at her age?

18:06.400 --> 18:07.447
It gets weirder.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.969
When we admitted her,
she had defensive wounds to her arms.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.847
Now, they're gone.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.247
Just give me a sec.

18:21.680 --> 18:22.681
Sure.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.688
Okay, what the hell?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.765
You checked Hayden out.
Did you notice anything weird?

18:29.040 --> 18:31.691
No, but... The girl could've
had internal injuries, or...

18:31.960 --> 18:35.043
But somehow, her external injuries
all healed? No way.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.244
<i>This is almost like, uh...</i>

18:39.160 --> 18:41.561
You know, what if she turned?

18:42.120 --> 18:43.246
What, like "wolfed out" turned?

18:44.360 --> 18:46.567
Explains the whole
"Wolverine healing factor" thing.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.883
Yeah, no, but that'd be crazy,
because that means she would've been bit.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.448
And Mick here says that
that didn't happen. Right, Mick?

18:55.840 --> 18:58.286
- Uh, no. Not that I saw.
- Are you 100%?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.006
Well, unless I made a mistake.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.605
- Hell of a mistake.
- Dean.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.245
No, I told you we shouldn't have
dragged him along.

19:04.480 --> 19:05.561
- I told you.
- Don't!

19:06.640 --> 19:08.688
Whatever got Hayden is still out there.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.247
Okay.
So, let's say the night of the attack,

19:13.480 --> 19:15.528
wolf ices big bro,
chomps down on little sis,

19:15.720 --> 19:18.041
and then poof, vanishes.
Does that make any sense?

19:19.600 --> 19:20.965
Maybe he let her go.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.844
On purpose? Why?

19:23.480 --> 19:26.609
Perhaps it didn't want her dead,
it wanted her turned.

19:27.320 --> 19:30.210
Right. Which means this wasn't random.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.006
Which means it would've been somebody
who knew her. Friends, family.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.287
Or someone from the bar.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.523
Okay. All right, Sam, you and Claire,

19:36.760 --> 19:39.240
you go talk to the girl
that she was supposed to be crashing with.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.405
And me and Amateur Hour will hit the bar,
see what shakes loose.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.850
So, really, things are good?

19:52.160 --> 19:54.447
Yeah, they're awesome.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.884
Really? You sure?

19:58.120 --> 19:59.804
Dude, take the "yes."

20:01.280 --> 20:03.442
Okay, so you wait here.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.721
What?

20:04.960 --> 20:08.442
Sam, no offense, but who do you think
the kids are gonna wanna talk to?

20:08.720 --> 20:11.291
Me, or some old skeezer?

20:11.480 --> 20:15.087
- Uh?
- Exactly. Be right back.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.565
"Skeezer"?

20:24.400 --> 20:28.485
Dean, what happened back there...
My mistake.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.009
- Won't happen again.
- Better not.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.001
Problem?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.324
You know, carpal tunnel.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.331
Allow me, your lordship.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.286
Thanks.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.167
DEAN: <i>Howdy.</i>

20:49.400 --> 20:50.765
Agent Strummer, this is Agent Vai.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.771
- Uh, hi.
- Do you recognize this girl?

20:54.640 --> 20:56.051
She was here three nights ago.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.481
Yeah... Not really.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.728
Yeah, I'd lie
if I served underage girls, too.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.441
Look, man, I...
I really need this job, I...

21:13.440 --> 21:17.570
She started coming in a few weeks ago.
After Connor got hired.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.801
Connor?

21:19.880 --> 21:23.168
Yeah, the other bartender.
They're having a thing.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.090
What kind of a thing?

21:26.800 --> 21:27.801
Ask him.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.571
Hi, Connor.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.523
Oh, nice ink.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.885
<i>So, you like high school girls,
do you, hmm?</i>

21:38.200 --> 21:40.282
You get older,
they stay the same age, is that it?

21:40.560 --> 21:41.686
That's not how it was.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.570
Oh, so, you weren't dating Hayden Foster?

21:43.840 --> 21:46.207
Dating?
No, I let her in from time to time.

21:46.440 --> 21:50.411
She is stupid hot, all right?
But that's it. Look, I swear.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.802
And the night she got attacked,
did you let her in that night, too?

21:53.080 --> 21:54.206
Look, I don't know what happened.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.244
I was behind the bar the whole night.
I didn't even see her leave.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.641
Hmm? And then what'd you do?

22:01.080 --> 22:03.447
- Guess I went home.
- You guess?

22:03.680 --> 22:05.125
Well, it's a simple question, Connor.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.244
I ask what you were doing,
then you tell me.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.682
For instance,
what were you doing last night?

22:13.360 --> 22:15.169
- Me?
- Yeah.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.765
Oh, I was writing my report.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.601
And then?

22:25.600 --> 22:28.922
Well, I watched an episode of <i>The
Great British Bake Off</i> and went to bed.

22:29.320 --> 22:30.685
Ha! See?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.121
Simple.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.882
I went home, man. And I didn't
do anything to that girl, okay?

22:37.720 --> 22:39.449
Yeah. Well, we'll see.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.641
Oh, one more thing, um...

22:43.520 --> 22:46.364
Did you happen to meet
a blonde girl the other night?

22:46.600 --> 22:47.965
About yea high? Feisty?

22:48.240 --> 22:50.402
Yeah, yeah. Said she was Hayden's cousin.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.727
Crazy bitch threw a beer at me.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.960
- Well, from what I heard, you earned it.
- What are you, her dad?

22:57.280 --> 22:59.487
Dude, come on. Girls like that?

23:00.120 --> 23:01.121
Yeah.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.727
You ever touch her again,
I'll break your face.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.165
- Nice work in there.
- Thank you.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.767
- Yeah, that alibi, I almost bought it.
- Sorry?

23:14.080 --> 23:15.809
See, here's the thing
about 16-year-old girls,

23:16.040 --> 23:19.487
especially 16-year-old,
freshly-minted werewolf girls...

23:20.320 --> 23:23.563
They don't just die.
And you been acting sketchy all day.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.404
I don't know what you're talking about.

23:27.320 --> 23:28.401
What did you do to her?

23:28.960 --> 23:30.849
- I did what needed to be done.
- And that means?

23:31.360 --> 23:35.081
Last night,
I injected her with silver nitrate.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.330
- So you killed her?
- No, she attacked me.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.002
She tore up my shoulder and...
I had orders.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.009
- No, you had a choice.
- Did I?

23:44.280 --> 23:45.930
Killing monsters is what we do.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.686
Or maybe, palling around with demons
and witches you've forgotten.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.411
Don't tell me how to do my job.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.004
- Well, then do it.
- You think it's that simple, huh?

23:53.240 --> 23:56.164
- I really do.
- Yeah. I used to think the same thing.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.727
But here's a little tip.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.321
Things aren't
just black and white out here.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.965
All you have is a case in front of you.
Like Hayden.

24:05.560 --> 24:07.881
Like a few months ago, there was this kid.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.523
<i>This psychic, she was killin' people,
but she didn't mean to hurt anyone.</i>

24:11.840 --> 24:13.205
<i>She was being abused.</i>

24:13.880 --> 24:18.010
So, we gave her a second chance,
because it was the right thing to do.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.804
Well, that's your luxury.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.685
<i>We have a Code.</i>

24:30.560 --> 24:31.561
MICK: <i>Thank you, Mr. Ketch.</i>

24:32.240 --> 24:36.245
Well, now Hayden's morn,
she gets to bury two kids, instead of one.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.721
Thanks to you and thanks to your Code.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.241
Nice work.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.650
I was kidding before,
but you really do look like a creeper.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.770
Funny. How'd it go?

24:53.080 --> 24:56.004
BFF found. Beans spilled.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.890
Hayden was hooking up
with this older guy on the DL

24:58.080 --> 25:00.242
and she was really into him,
but he was a total stalker,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.762
texting constantly, ultra-possessive.

25:03.040 --> 25:05.520
Skeeved her friend out so much,
she narc'd to Hayden's brother.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.048
I guess that explains why he was there.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.843
I did good, right?

25:14.920 --> 25:18.561
Claire, why does Jody think
you're in Madison looking at colleges?

25:18.840 --> 25:19.966
You called her?

25:26.600 --> 25:29.206
- Did you tell?
- No. Not yet.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.680
Well, why are you lying to her?

25:32.920 --> 25:37.323
Look, I know, okay?
I know how much I owe Jody.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.809
But we tried the whole hunting thing,

25:40.080 --> 25:42.731
and I just ended up sitting in the car
while she does everything.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.724
I guess she's taking it slow.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.970
She wants me to be normal.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.127
Go to nursing school like Alex.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.085
- Did she actually say that?
- She doesn't have to.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.849
I'm better off on my own.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.649
This way, everybody's happy.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.644
Claire, Jody's not gonna be happy
when she finds out.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.042
- And if something happened to you...
- I'm careful.

26:08.360 --> 26:09.725
You need to tell her the truth.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.001
You know what?

26:13.840 --> 26:17.162
Screw you. I'm so sick of you guys
dive-bombing my life.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.890
- Pretending like you care...
- We do care.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.049
Then stop treating me like a stupid kid!

26:21.320 --> 26:22.731
Then stop acting like one.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.001
Claire.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.604
Hey, hey, hey, Claire. Hey.

27:48.960 --> 27:52.931
It's okay. It's me, it's me. I got you.
I got you. I got you. You're safe.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.566
We gotta cool her off. She's burning up.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.086
No, no, no. Keep her warm.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.441
- Back off.
- Shut up.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.250
Look, I understand you're angry...

28:07.480 --> 28:08.606
Mick, you killed a kid.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.690
We're not angry, we're done.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.122
How long have I got, until...

28:15.360 --> 28:18.409
Sometimes, it takes a full moon,
sometimes it just takes time.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.171
Hey, hey, listen to me.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.928
Look, nobody said
this is gonna be easy, okay?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.440
But you can live with this.

28:29.720 --> 28:30.721
No way.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.125
Hey, look, so you have to stay locked up
a few nights outta the month, okay?

28:35.400 --> 28:38.051
- The rest of the time, you're you.
- Unless I break out.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.246
Maybe some people can control this,

28:44.640 --> 28:47.211
but I can barely keep it together
on a good day.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.201
So, if there's any chance
that I could hurt Jody,

28:53.160 --> 28:56.369
or Alex or anyone...

28:58.440 --> 28:59.680
I'd rather die.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.285
Claire, there may be another way.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.482
There's the blood therapy
that you talk about.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.051
I told you, it doesn't work.

29:06.360 --> 29:10.604
It says right here, uh,
"One out of nine test subjects was cured."

29:10.880 --> 29:12.325
- "Cured?"
- Yes.

29:12.560 --> 29:13.971
That study was on mice.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.841
You wanna tell me
what the hell he's talking about?

29:18.200 --> 29:20.646
We experimented
with the blood of sire werewolves,

29:21.000 --> 29:24.527
and we found it was possible to
reverse the early stages of lycanthropy.

29:24.720 --> 29:25.801
In rodents.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.365
So, you never tested on humans?

29:28.560 --> 29:30.210
- Once.
- And?

29:31.000 --> 29:33.082
The subject died. In agony.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.401
Sorry.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.600
Maybe second time's a charm.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.201
Hey, no, no, you don't get a vote in this.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.484
It's my life. I get all the votes.

29:46.840 --> 29:48.205
Sam, you wanna back me up here?

29:49.640 --> 29:50.641
It's her life.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.122
Well, I bet you think
this is a great solution, hmm?

29:57.720 --> 30:01.566
It works or she dies.
Either way, one less monster, right?

30:01.880 --> 30:03.609
I don't think
there's any "great solutions" here.

30:03.880 --> 30:05.041
CLAIRE: <i>Dean.</i>

30:05.440 --> 30:07.966
<i>Please? I can't.</i>

30:13.640 --> 30:14.641
All right.

30:16.120 --> 30:20.330
If we do this, if, how do we get it done?

30:21.040 --> 30:24.931
We need blood, live blood,
from the werewolf that bit her.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.406
SAM: <i>Okay, great.</i>

30:26.720 --> 30:27.721
Who we looking at?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.489
Tribal tat, back at the bar.

30:30.760 --> 30:33.445
We shook him down about Claire,
and right after, she gets bit.

30:33.760 --> 30:34.761
That's not a coincidence.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.321
Timeline fits. Connection to both victims.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.280
MICK: <i>Then we should go.</i>

30:39.680 --> 30:42.411
The full moon rises in less than an hour,
and if she turns and feeds,

30:42.640 --> 30:44.722
our cheery success rate drops to zero.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.921
Let's go.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.281
<i>Not you.</i>

30:49.400 --> 30:50.447
You stay with her.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.761
You trust him?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.206
Mick's a smart guy,

30:54.440 --> 30:56.841
so when I say that if anything happens
to her, and I mean anything...

30:57.120 --> 30:58.326
You'll kill me.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.369
Like I said, smart.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.162
Sam, if you're not back...

31:04.560 --> 31:05.561
We'll be back.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.409
All right, don't move! Don't move!
It's silver.

31:32.760 --> 31:33.966
He's human.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.490
Let's give it time.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.804
It burns!

32:13.840 --> 32:16.571
You don't understand. It's happening!

32:17.520 --> 32:19.090
- Give it to me!
- No!

32:19.360 --> 32:20.407
Then you do it. Please!

32:20.640 --> 32:23.291
It's happening
and you don't understand how this feels.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.684
I know a man
that would shoot you right now,

32:30.960 --> 32:32.246
without a moment's thought.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.323
<i>And every instinct I have says he's right.</i>

32:38.240 --> 32:39.446
That I ought to do my duty.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.081
But...

32:46.200 --> 32:48.407
But my instincts
haven't been so grand of late.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.407
Sit down.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.008
Now, okay, here's what we're gonna do.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.925
Firstly, we're gonna restrain you,
all right?

33:07.200 --> 33:10.886
For my protection, okay? And then...

33:12.400 --> 33:16.121
Then we're gonna sedate you,
also for my protection.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.569
With any luck, when you wake up,
this'll all be over.

33:20.880 --> 33:22.609
If I wake up.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.248
I gotta call Jody.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.291
She's gonna be so mad at me.

33:38.920 --> 33:39.921
Claire, get back!

34:01.880 --> 34:02.881
DEAN: <i>Claire?</i>

34:05.120 --> 34:06.121
Where is she?

34:07.000 --> 34:08.650
The wolf, he took her.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.810
- What did I tell you?
- I tried to stop him, okay?

34:13.120 --> 34:16.841
I can find her.
I put a tracker in her pocket.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.366
You planted a bug on her?

34:18.639 --> 34:21.928
Okay. You can kill me later.
After we find Claire.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.400
I know this is sudden...

34:35.679 --> 34:37.728
but you and your friends,
you should've let me have Hayden.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.090
<i>She was miserable here, she...</i>

34:41.159 --> 34:42.730
We had big plans.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.571
Yeah? Is that before or after you bit her?

34:45.920 --> 34:47.649
I had to know
if she could survive the change.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.081
Not everyone does.

34:52.639 --> 34:55.530
See? It hurts at first,

34:55.920 --> 34:58.048
<i>but eventually,
it's like the best drug ever.</i>

34:58.360 --> 35:00.089
- Times 1,000.
- Right.

35:00.520 --> 35:01.965
Eat me, Teen Wolf.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.368
It's not like I want to do this.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.847
My pack, we were happy.
We didn't hurt anyone.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.289
And then hunters with weapons
that I'd never seen before,

35:09.520 --> 35:11.170
they show up and...

35:14.640 --> 35:16.847
They take out 20 of us, just like that.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.811
The ones that made it, we split up,
but we weren't meant to live like that.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.530
A werewolf needs his pack.

35:25.080 --> 35:26.730
You'll see. I'm a nice guy.

35:27.720 --> 35:29.802
Yeah?
You know who says they're a nice guy?

35:30.160 --> 35:33.084
Clingy, insecure bitches
with mommy issues.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.724
That's just the change talking.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.364
You'll feel better once you eat.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.210
Try it, you'll like it.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.087
As soon as I saw you, I knew...

35:55.360 --> 35:56.566
You're just like me.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.561
Alone.

36:03.240 --> 36:07.962
Wrong. I have a family. And they love me.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.921
DEAN: <i>Claire?</i>

36:25.920 --> 36:26.967
<i>Claire?</i>

36:29.440 --> 36:30.601
DEAN: <i>All right, easy.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:33.566
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.886
Mick! Get over here.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.727
Sorry, kid.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.330
Move, move, move.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.001
Claire. Claire.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.522
Okay. Claire, it's us. You know us.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.241
Is that thing ready yet?

37:35.520 --> 37:36.567
Ready. It's ready. Go, go, go.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.411
- She wanted this, right?
- Oh, yeah.

38:16.160 --> 38:17.889
I'm gonna get some air.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.291
SAM: <i>Claire?</i>

38:45.920 --> 38:47.126
Dean.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.770
You guys look like crap.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.491
Here's to you.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.564
That girl is a walking miracle.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.321
Yeah, she is.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.167
Listen, uh...

39:52.320 --> 39:53.810
- Thanks for the win back there.
- Yeah.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.526
- So, we're good?
- SAM: <i>Not quite.</i>

39:58.440 --> 39:59.885
But we'll give you a second chance.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.490
Just don't mess it up.
There won't be a third.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.766
Okay.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.969
Hey, how you feelin'?

40:09.160 --> 40:12.243
Honestly?
I'm sort of craving a Milk-Bone right now.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.889
Look, um, what I said before...

40:20.920 --> 40:23.526
You guys are here when I need you,
and that's all that matters.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.171
You gonna tell Jody what happened?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.001
I don't know.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.003
Well, whatever you decide,
we got your back.

40:39.440 --> 40:41.602
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>Leave a message after the tone.</i>

40:41.800 --> 40:45.646
Hey, it's me. Claire.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.530
Okay, um, here goes.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.367
<i>I've been hunting. Alone.</i>

40:55.720 --> 40:57.688
<i>And I know it's not what you want to hear.</i>

40:59.640 --> 41:01.324
And I know it sounds scary.

41:02.520 --> 41:03.806
It scares me, too, sometimes.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.806
But this is something
I have to do on my own.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.571
Just for a little while.

41:11.960 --> 41:13.325
But I'm ready.

41:15.480 --> 41:19.087
And I never would've been
if it wasn't for you being my mother.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.564
Well, I better go, um...

41:23.880 --> 41:25.689
Tell Alex she better not touch my stuff.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.400
I love you guys.
