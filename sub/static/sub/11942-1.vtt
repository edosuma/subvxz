00:45.503 --> 00:47.212
Come on, get up.

00:48.339 --> 00:51.050
You need to buy gifts for your kids
before we leave.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.177
I'll pick up something at the airport.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.386
No way.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.597
Airport gifts suck.

00:56.765 --> 00:59.391
Marie, please let me sleep
another half hour.

01:00.894 --> 01:01.977
Fine.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.065
If you won't buy the gifts
for your kids, I will.

01:07.317 --> 01:11.445
Can you ask the front desk
to prepare the bill...

01:11.613 --> 01:13.739
...and have some breakfast sent up?

01:13.907 --> 01:17.826
You know what?
The posters are up, all over Paris.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.620
Apparently, you can't miss them.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.675
How many have you seen?

01:34.803 --> 01:35.844
Really?

01:45.563 --> 01:48.107
They said there would be
120 across Paris.

01:48.441 --> 01:52.986
Can you sum up the headlines for me?
I won't have time to go online.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.240
That's good.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.952
Big kisses, bye-bye.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.139
I feel bad. I should've stayed on
to cover the story.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.475
After what happened to you?

26:02.143 --> 26:04.311
They've sent a crew
from the Hong Kong office.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.481
I've never done that...

26:07.649 --> 26:09.149
...run away from such a story.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.204
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.123
- Should I come up?
- No, I'll be fine.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.916
I almost forgot...

27:08.084 --> 27:09.501
...the gifts for your kids.

27:11.755 --> 27:12.796
I love you.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.835
The estimated figures are
at several billion dollars.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.921
But of course, we're going to talk
about the survivors...

27:54.089 --> 27:56.590
...because we hope there are survivors.

27:56.758 --> 28:01.595
The number of victims is estimated
at several hundred thousand.

28:02.430 --> 28:07.017
It is a horrific scene here,
as this tsunami...

28:07.185 --> 28:08.977
...has devastated the population.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.671
Good evening, everyone.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.407
Marie, can you hear me?

29:07.704 --> 29:10.164
Everybody, break a leg.
Ready and on the air in...

29:10.331 --> 29:11.957
...five, four...

29:12.125 --> 29:13.709
...three, two...

29:14.335 --> 29:15.586
...and cue, Miss Lelay.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.339
Good evening,
and welcome to a new edition...

29:19.507 --> 29:21.091
...ofWindow on Events.

29:21.426 --> 29:24.052
Tonight, our guest is
Guillaume Belcher...

29:24.220 --> 29:28.515
...CEO of famous
clothing manufacturer Soucil.

29:28.683 --> 29:32.436
We're going to present to you
a shocking investigation...

29:32.604 --> 29:36.690
...on child labor in their factories
in Southeast Asia.

29:37.358 --> 29:39.318
Cyril Guignard reporting.

29:40.570 --> 29:44.990
Here in the West, it's easy to criticize
Third World labor practices.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.995
But the truth is...

29:50.163 --> 29:51.205
...these factories...

29:51.372 --> 29:54.917
...play a vital role in
industrial development...

29:55.084 --> 29:57.753
...and evolution of poorer countries.

29:59.380 --> 30:02.800
And let's be clear about this,
the wages we are paying...

30:03.218 --> 30:06.512
...are substantially higher
than local wages.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.388
Marie, go at him!

30:20.401 --> 30:21.735
Marie, do you hear me?

30:22.737 --> 30:24.238
Pull this guy apart!

30:24.572 --> 30:26.240
You hear me, get him!

30:29.410 --> 30:35.457
But will this kind of justification satisfy
French customers...

30:36.251 --> 30:37.501
...Mr. Belcher?

30:37.669 --> 30:40.921
If they were aware of the conditions
under which the clothes are produced...

30:41.089 --> 30:44.508
...do you think you would
still be profitable?

30:45.468 --> 30:49.388
Go there and you'll see how much
these people need us.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.602
Thank you for watching.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.021
That's all for now, see you next week.

31:04.612 --> 31:07.030
I'm sorry, that was unforgivable.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.449
We'll fix it in the edit. No one will notice.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.285
And it was my fault.

31:11.452 --> 31:14.413
A defensive CEO was a tough start
for the new season.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.791
Do you want to get something to eat?

31:22.922 --> 31:24.131
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.140
I think something happened
to me out there.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.309
You had a close call.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.561
No, something really happened to me.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.147
When I went underwater...

31:42.692 --> 31:44.192
...I had visions.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.448
I don't know.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.825
You had a concussion.
You hit your head.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.081
You're right.

32:11.346 --> 32:15.015
Two right-wing newspapers claim Sikhs
were out in the streets...

32:15.725 --> 32:17.851
...burning cars, looting shops.

32:19.103 --> 32:23.523
Others say the unrest was triggered by
elements within the nationalist parties...

32:24.192 --> 32:27.027
...to cast negative suspicion
on racial minorities.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.613
What do you think about
the story on the Sikhs?

32:29.781 --> 32:31.031
What?

32:31.199 --> 32:32.866
The story on the Sikhs,
what do you think?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.701
It's very good.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.791
Listen, I've got to work late
and finish some things.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.251
See you tomorrow.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.257
Can I say something...

32:51.719 --> 32:53.887
...you might find difficult to hear?

32:54.764 --> 32:57.224
I think you came back to work too soon.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.811
Physically, you're fine.
But since the accident...

33:02.397 --> 33:05.732
Take some time off
to get over what happened.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.734
Just a couple of weeks.

33:07.902 --> 33:09.152
To "get over"?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.405
You've always said you wanted to write.

33:11.572 --> 33:14.533
Your book idea, Michel would jump on it
and pay good money.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.577
But that would take time.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.290
This will all be here waiting for you.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.794
What matters is that you feel better.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.754
We need you too much.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.091
I'll think about it.

47:09.159 --> 47:13.746
Summing up France's postwar history,
only two statesmen counted:

47:13.914 --> 47:15.540
De Gaulle and him.

47:15.707 --> 47:20.586
On de Gaulle, everything's been written.
On Mitterrand, I want to finish the job.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.421
There are fascinating elements.

47:22.589 --> 47:24.841
The abolition of the death penalty,
the European Union.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.343
Coming from a right-wing family,
he seduced the left.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.512
And what's more,
converted it to liberalism.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.014
Amazing! It was a revolution, right?

47:32.182 --> 47:36.185
Plus the darker sides of his character
that have never been explored.

47:36.353 --> 47:40.231
He's been dead for 10 years.
The timing is right, we can dig deeper.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.858
I want to dig into his past.

47:42.025 --> 47:44.986
Vichy, the Elf scandal...
What part did he play?

47:45.153 --> 47:47.113
The Taiwan frigates,
the Papon scandal...

47:47.281 --> 47:48.656
...Mazarine, Marguerite Duras.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.993
These stories were never really addressed.
They've all been buried.

47:52.160 --> 47:54.579
I'm going to tell who knew,
who didn't talk.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.498
Isn't that going to bring us
too much controversy?

47:57.666 --> 47:59.292
I don't think so.

47:59.835 --> 48:02.003
What I want is a book
that can be read by all.

48:02.170 --> 48:04.964
Mitterrand was not just a politician.

48:05.549 --> 48:07.550
Mitterrand was an icon.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.635
He's "Tonton," our uncle!

48:09.803 --> 48:12.013
Maybe that's what we should use
as the title!

48:12.180 --> 48:13.639
Tonton.

48:19.229 --> 48:21.314
I'm not sure we can keep that title.

48:24.234 --> 48:26.485
Of course not. It was a joke.

48:26.653 --> 48:29.196
I'll welcome your suggestions
for the title.

48:29.364 --> 48:34.243
How about Chipping Away at the Myth
or The Vacillating Statue?

48:35.162 --> 48:36.871
I look forward to your suggestions.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.497
We'll make a list.

48:46.924 --> 48:48.049
Congratulations.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.427
The timing couldn't be better.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.639
Politically, there's nothing going on
now anyway.

48:54.806 --> 48:58.059
You'll write the book you've always
wanted to. You'll get some rest.

48:59.186 --> 49:02.188
Come this summer,
you'll be back on the air...

49:02.356 --> 49:05.942
...with a bestseller under your belt,
and a big renegotiated contract.

49:07.361 --> 49:08.736
Stronger than ever.

49:08.946 --> 49:10.071
Exactly.

49:10.238 --> 49:12.698
Adapting and turning misfortune
to your advantage.

49:13.283 --> 49:16.827
That's what I've always loved about you,
never a victim.

49:16.995 --> 49:18.329
That's right.

49:18.497 --> 49:22.541
Never a victim, never vulnerable,
never complains.

49:23.335 --> 49:26.128
Excuse me. Your table is ready.

49:26.713 --> 49:29.090
Great. I'm starving.

49:34.596 --> 49:36.263
Can I ask you something?

49:36.431 --> 49:39.308
What do you think happens
when we die?

49:39.476 --> 49:40.935
That's a strange question!

49:41.103 --> 49:42.478
Tell me.

49:42.646 --> 49:45.439
When you die, you die.
The lights go out, that's it.

49:45.607 --> 49:47.024
Why?

49:49.486 --> 49:52.071
That's it? Just blackout?

49:52.239 --> 49:55.324
Totally black, the plug's pulled out.

49:55.492 --> 49:56.867
The eternal void.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.665
Don't you think it's possible
that there is something?

50:02.874 --> 50:04.166
Like what?

50:04.334 --> 50:06.752
I don't know, something...

50:08.547 --> 50:09.714
A hereafter.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.675
No, I don't.

50:12.843 --> 50:16.595
If that were the case, wouldn't someone
have discovered it by now?

50:16.763 --> 50:18.764
And there would be proof.

50:21.435 --> 50:22.768
I guess.

50:24.938 --> 50:27.106
Do you have a lot of questions like that?

50:30.068 --> 50:31.360
More champagne?

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.047
Good evening.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:26.010
Following a joint statement by Vivendi
and electricity giant VFM...

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.763
...announcing higher than expected
quarterly profits...

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:34.268
...we wonder if evoking France's economic
downturn might be premature?

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:50.592
Sorry, we are running a little late.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:51.802
Come in.

01:29:51.969 --> 01:29:54.888
Everyone is upset by the events.

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:00.519
Sit down.

01:30:03.731 --> 01:30:06.483
Marie, to be honest with you,
I'm a bit confused.

01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.569
I thought we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

01:30:09.737 --> 01:30:12.322
Instead, you give us
the first three chapters of...

01:30:12.490 --> 01:30:13.573
...Hereafter:

01:30:15.159 --> 01:30:16.910
The Conspiracy of Silence.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:20.664
I realize it's not
what you were expecting.

01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:24.167
You always said there weren't
enough surprises in publishing.

01:30:24.335 --> 01:30:26.503
Well, this is certainly a surprise!

01:30:32.135 --> 01:30:34.344
I don't know where to begin.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:36.012
Did you at least find it interesting?

01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:39.975
Of course.
You've always had a nose for a good story.

01:30:40.143 --> 01:30:41.935
But we're a political publisher-

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.353
This is political!

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:47.649
This kind of material, however fascinating,
is for a specialized market.

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:50.944
This morning, in London, six bombs
went off in the heart of the city.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:55.532
Apparently coordinated, the bombs
exploded at the height of the rush hour.

01:30:59.745 --> 01:31:01.538
Why are you all against this?

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:11.131
Why are you so afraid of this?

01:31:11.674 --> 01:31:13.049
This is real!

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.219
This is scientific evidence...

01:31:16.387 --> 01:31:19.389
...from well-known researchers
forced to work in secret.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:24.561
A Nobel Prize winner, hounded
by the religious lobby. That's a story!

01:31:25.688 --> 01:31:28.857
Better than a philandering,
dishonest old politician.

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:32.819
But a book like that would probably
have to be written in English...

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.738
...for the American market.

01:31:35.865 --> 01:31:37.657
It happened to me, Michel.

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:41.411
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.247
Where we're going.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.918
What we'll experience.

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:51.713
Each and every one of us.

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:55.592
That doesn't interest you?

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:03.350
Now listen, we commissioned a book
about Francois Mitterrand.

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:06.436
Either we agree on this
and you start writing it...

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:09.397
...or else I want my money back.
That's all I can say.

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:34.839
It was so humiliating.

01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:39.135
They looked at me as if I'd lost my mind.

01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:42.097
Six months ago they begged me
to write about anything.

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:45.392
Anything by the great Marie Lelay.

01:32:47.144 --> 01:32:50.814
You'd better give me my job back.
I've had enough with being humiliated.

01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:56.486
Today, they even took down my posters.

01:32:59.991 --> 01:33:01.324
Why didn't you tell me?

01:33:03.619 --> 01:33:04.869
And your book?

01:33:06.872 --> 01:33:10.500
I'll finish it in my spare time.
It's caused me enough trouble as it is.

01:33:13.838 --> 01:33:15.005
What's the matter?

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:17.382
Look...

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:20.302
...getting your job back...

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:22.679
...might not be as easy as you think.

01:33:23.598 --> 01:33:24.681
Why?

01:33:25.349 --> 01:33:27.642
It was a temporary break.
And on your advice.

01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:29.519
I know, but-

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.188
What we couldn't have foreseen is...

01:33:32.356 --> 01:33:35.358
...you'd be talking in public
about these experiences.

01:33:35.526 --> 01:33:39.779
- That you'd lose your credibility.
- But I didn't want to write this book!

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:41.531
It was your idea!

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:44.159
It was my idea you should write
about Mitterrand.

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:47.037
So, what are you saying?

01:33:48.331 --> 01:33:50.874
I'm saying take some more time.

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:54.044
Finish the book, get it out
of your system, then come back.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.380
It's that girl, isn't it?
My replacement?

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:01.009
I've watched her a few times.
She's good.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:04.012
Yes, she is.
But not as good as you.

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:07.223
You're sleeping with her?

01:34:08.684 --> 01:34:10.435
How can you say such a thing?

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:15.732
You always told me to ask
the tough questions.

01:34:33.250 --> 01:34:34.584
It's funny...

01:34:36.253 --> 01:34:37.879
Who'd have thought it?

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.217
A few months ago I was famous.

01:34:43.094 --> 01:34:44.594
Rich.

01:34:46.097 --> 01:34:47.597
A success story.

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:51.393
I was happy.

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:55.188
Fulfilled by my work.

01:34:56.732 --> 01:34:58.191
By you.

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:16.751
All this happened because
you didn't buy your kids their gifts.

01:35:16.919 --> 01:35:18.336
Because of what?

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:21.131
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.426
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

01:35:49.744 --> 01:35:50.785
It's Michel.

01:35:52.455 --> 01:35:53.621
Listen...

01:35:55.124 --> 01:35:57.834
I feel terrible about our meeting
earlier today.

01:35:59.503 --> 01:36:02.172
This book is obviously
very important to you.

01:36:03.841 --> 01:36:07.343
I think everyone was a bit on edge
because of the events in London.

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:14.434
But I made a few calls. There are
two publishers who might be interested.

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:17.061
One American, one English.

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:19.272
Do you have a pen?

01:36:27.072 --> 01:36:28.531
I'm listening.
