00:01.135 --> 00:02.636
Previously,
on The Good Doctor...

00:02.670 --> 00:04.938
You work together and
you are sleeping together.

00:04.971 --> 00:07.241
You don't see any way
that can go wrong?

00:07.275 --> 00:08.676
You went out
on a limb for me.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.179
You fire me now, you look 
like a fool in front of the board.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.681
Dr. Andrews, I don't think you 
have the votes to carry it.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.982
But I don't
need the votes.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.684
Just as you have the power
to fire someone

00:16.717 --> 00:18.352
under your supervision,
so do I.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.587
Did you
hear about Han?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.589
Can't imagine Andrews
will survive the fallout.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.191
They're gonna need
a new Chief of Surgery.

00:23.224 --> 00:25.159
Aoki should be calling you 
with the offer any minute.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.996
Here are flowers
and chocolates.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.831
Are you asking me out?
Yes.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.533
I would love to.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:41.709 --> 00:43.211
Why are you
smiling?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.247
I don't know.

00:47.848 --> 00:51.319
I just...
I wanted you to know that

00:51.352 --> 00:52.886
things are okay.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.188
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> If I start a commotion</i> </font>

00:54.222 --> 00:55.556
Good.

00:55.589 --> 00:59.327
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> I run the risk
of losing you, and that's worse</i> </font>

01:02.430 --> 01:04.965
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love

01:04.998 --> 01:07.335
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love,

01:07.368 --> 01:09.537
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love,
in love with someone</i> </font>

01:09.570 --> 01:12.039
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> You shouldn't have
fallen in love with?</i> </font>

01:13.141 --> 01:15.809
I saw a movie
last weekend.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.211
Which one?
Was it good?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.346
What kind of movies
do you like?

01:18.379 --> 01:21.982
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> What a shame</i> </font>

01:22.015 --> 01:24.084
Oh. This looks delicious.
Thank you.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.219
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love
with someone</i> </font>

01:25.253 --> 01:26.820
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love</i> </font>

01:26.854 --> 01:28.822
I said no pickles.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.158
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Ever fallen in love 
Pardon me?</i> </font>

01:30.191 --> 01:32.493
It's okay. They can
just take that off...
I said no pickles.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.727
Oh. I am so sorry.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.363
I said no pickles.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.803
It was a disaster.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.808
What happened?

01:49.277 --> 01:50.578
Don't you all
have work to do?

01:50.611 --> 01:51.779
Sorry.
We were just...

01:51.812 --> 01:53.614
Shaun was on a date.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.882
Hmm.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.850
Congratulations
on your promotion.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.919
I believe you're our first
female Chief of Surgery.

02:00.154 --> 02:03.624
That's nice.
Uh, thank you. Yes.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.125
And you're still
not working.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.364
Not you.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.300
We need to go to H.R.
and break up.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.312
We need a head CT
and a trauma panel.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.914
Please! Someone!
Help my wife!

02:43.764 --> 02:45.833
We've been married
for 45 years.

02:45.866 --> 02:46.967
Two children.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.068
Eh, so far.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.403
Oh, stop it.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.604
Ricky and Tammy.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.106
Ricky's got two kids
of his own.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.675
When did you
first notice the pain?

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
This morning.
No, on Saturday.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.146
He has a history
of kidney stones.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.614
I try to get him
to drink more water...

03:00.648 --> 03:02.015
You "try"?

03:02.049 --> 03:04.017
When did I ever
say no to you?

03:05.319 --> 03:07.855
It's probably another stone,
but we'll do some imaging

03:07.888 --> 03:09.490
to rule out anything
more serious.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.991
Oh, thank you.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.360
Did you tell them
about the kids?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.295
We have two, you know.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.829
So far.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.466
That's nice.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.871
Not it.
What?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.473
He's got dementia,
and even worse, it's boring.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.840
Probably stones.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.276
Best case scenario,
it's a kidney tumor.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.210
We've assisted
on eight nephrectomies.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.979
It's your case,
your chart, you're primary.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.547
Kellan's coming to town.
I need to be out of here

03:33.581 --> 03:35.549
at a decent hour,
and we are not children.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.486
We do not decide things
by who called it.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.053
You touched the chart first.
It's yours.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.389
Did not.
Did so.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.524
We walked up together,
Petringa handed the chart to you.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.658
Did not.
Did so.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.126
Did not.
Did so.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.361
Why?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.564
It just wasn't
working out.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.801
Oh. Well, I certainly hope
it's not because in light of

03:53.834 --> 03:55.969
Dr. Lim's recent promotion
to Chief of Surgery

03:56.003 --> 03:57.971
that she's now
your supervisor?

03:58.005 --> 04:00.240
We knew that arrangement
would be unacceptable,

04:00.274 --> 04:01.542
and since
we only recently

04:01.575 --> 04:02.710
started seeing
each other...

04:02.743 --> 04:05.513
You were seeing each other
secretly for some time

04:05.546 --> 04:07.214
before you reported it,
correct?

04:09.016 --> 04:11.685
So, maybe you've
just gone back

04:11.719 --> 04:13.120
to seeing each other
in secret.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.757
No. Uh, we made

04:16.790 --> 04:18.492
the decision
that this opportunity

04:18.526 --> 04:19.593
for Dr. Lim is just...

04:21.894 --> 04:23.331
You're... What...
What are you writing?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.733
I have accepted
your explanation and report.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.001
Thank you.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.670
But I don't believe it.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.071
You're going to keep
seeing each other,

04:31.104 --> 04:34.708
and I can't do anything to stop that,
nor do I even want to.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.545
But know this.
Love doesn't conquer all,

04:37.578 --> 04:40.948
lust doesn't either,
and like doesn't even come close.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.585
This is gonna be a lot more complicated
than either of you think.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.857
Looks like you have a large 
uterine fibroid that's bled.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.625
It has to be
removed surgically.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.727
Yes, routine surgery.
You should be fine.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.029
Uterine? Am I gonna
be able to have...

04:56.063 --> 04:58.466
The surgery won't affect your 
ability to have children.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.404
I didn't let her finish
her question because

05:03.437 --> 05:05.606
I anticipated what
she was going to ask

05:05.639 --> 05:07.608
because the uterus
has very few functions.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.544
Nicely done.
Yes.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.145
To improve O.R. access,

05:12.179 --> 05:13.814
we're going to
automatic block release

05:13.847 --> 05:16.617
and implement staggered
starts for anesthesia.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.818
Any questions?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.286
Dr. Andrews
and Dr. Han

05:19.319 --> 05:20.721
wouldn't authorize
staff overtime.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.789
Now, our nurses...

05:21.822 --> 05:23.724
Good point. Thank you.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.858
Yes. Authorized.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.229
One other thing, and this is
really for our third years,

05:29.262 --> 05:31.399
but it will affect
all of you.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.067
Traditionally, you don't get to lead 
surgeries until fourth year.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.503
That will be changing.

05:35.536 --> 05:38.406
The earlier you get in there
and take responsibility,

05:38.439 --> 05:40.441
the more chance
you have to learn.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.942
When the right
surgery comes along,

05:41.975 --> 05:44.478
something simple,
basic,

05:44.512 --> 05:46.313
it'll be yours.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.481
Start prepping.

05:54.321 --> 05:56.356
Maybe I did touch
the chart first.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.459
Relax. It's okay.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.961
I can stay late now and again.
This is my job.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.295
Stop it.

06:02.329 --> 06:04.932
You don't want the case.
It's boring. I get it.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.968
I know you get it.
Boring is now exciting.

06:08.001 --> 06:10.170
Boring means
it's a routine surgery,

06:10.203 --> 06:12.005
which means it's a surgery
that Lim just said

06:12.039 --> 06:13.474
one of us may well lead.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.108
This one's probably
no surgery at all.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.978
It's probably just kidney stones and late nights
with a man with dementia.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.680
I'll take that chance.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.848
You hate people.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.149
People don't know that.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.817
People like me.

06:24.552 --> 06:25.719
You need to be
with your family.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.621
Kellan's 16.
He barely talks to me.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.790
It's who touched the chart first, 
which, as you said, was me.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.258
And as you said...
Excuse me.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.895
Y-Yes, Harvey?
Is everything okay?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.664
Why am I in here?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.567
Nothing to worry about.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.234
It's likely just a kidney stone.
You just have to...

06:41.268 --> 06:43.203
Yes!
It's cancer.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.640
Nicely isolated,
simple surgery.

06:46.674 --> 06:49.142
Perfect for a resident.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.580
Put some
traction on the uterus

06:52.613 --> 06:53.747
to expose
the broad ligament.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.051
I'll slide the pelvic
retractor under the fundus.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.856
Did the wine
spill all over you?

07:03.290 --> 07:04.424
Um...

07:06.594 --> 07:08.228
Did it spill
all over Carly?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.262
S-Stop.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.901
Look above
the posterior cul de sac.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.073
Cancer.
Yes.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.643
Very extensive,
I think.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.882
It appears to have
metastasized everywhere.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.585
Liver, kidney,
abdominal wall.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.561
Close her up.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.307
I rang the doorbell.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.610
Yes, you did.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.045
Are you gonna spend
the rest of your life

07:58.078 --> 07:59.947
lying around
in this backyard?

07:59.980 --> 08:02.983
That, and lying next
to my future wife.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.418
Congratulations.
I heard.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.020
But what are you going to
do professionally?

08:11.024 --> 08:13.326
When people think they're
going to die, like you did,

08:13.360 --> 08:17.097
they assess their life,
reevaluate what's important.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.268
You're going to need
to make a difference.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.972
Do you have a puppy
for me to adopt?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.774
I have a vacancy
at President.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.009
Again?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.111
You're interested,

08:31.144 --> 08:32.746
but you think things
have to change.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.313
They don't.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.950
You led a meaningful life
before cancer,

08:36.984 --> 08:38.885
and you will lead
a meaningful life after.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.492
Well, thank you.
I'm very inspired.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.194
Think about it.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.529
Also, sunscreen.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.672
What's going on behind
the pancreas at the root

08:58.706 --> 09:00.373
of the superior
mesenteric artery?

09:00.407 --> 09:02.042
We need
a better angle.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.677
We're not gonna get
a better angle.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.146
Definitely not when
we're actually operating.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.215
So what's the solution?

09:09.516 --> 09:11.284
There isn't one.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.786
Not surgically.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.922
We should refer them
to an oncologist.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.324
Chemo might help,
but I'm not hopeful.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.593
What are you
gonna tell them?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.063
You guys are third year.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.564
You want stuff
to learn by doing?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.900
How about sympathetic
communication?

09:26.934 --> 09:30.838
Shaun, let the bride know
she's probably dying.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.316
This morning, who did you
give the Calderon chart to?

09:43.350 --> 09:44.752
I gave it to you guys.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.053
Uh, but you handed it
to one of us.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.520
One of us actually
took it from you.

09:47.554 --> 09:48.989
It was me, right?

09:49.022 --> 09:51.191
I don't know. What does it matter?
You just came up and...

09:51.224 --> 09:52.826
From the right.
I came up on Morgan's left.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.861
You're left-handed?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.897
It only makes sense
that I would be closer to...

09:56.930 --> 09:58.598
Excuse me.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.567
Is there any news
about my husband?

10:06.573 --> 10:09.509
Harvey, you remember
Drs. Park and Reznick.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.644
They did your scan.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.012
R-Right.
For my, uh...

10:12.045 --> 10:13.947
They were looking
for kidney stones.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.716
Unfortunately,
we found some cancer.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.985
It's on your
left kidney. Cancer?

10:18.018 --> 10:19.920
The good news is
it's isolated

10:19.953 --> 10:21.454
and in a very
operable location.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.791
Cancer.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.292
I have cancer?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.361
We have to tell
the children.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.797
We'll do
a biopsy to confirm,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.899
but I'm confident
that we caught it early.

10:33.566 --> 10:36.403
This is terrible.
I... I can't die.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.305
I...You need me.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.142
I know.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.311
But with surgery, radiation,
and immunotherapy,

10:44.344 --> 10:46.046
the prognosis
is excellent.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.525
You're supposed to be
talking to our patient.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.261
They can wait
until we're sure.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.832
We are sure.
Dr. Melendez is sure.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.168
Dr. Lim told us we're ready for
more responsibility,

11:08.201 --> 11:10.670
so I decided I can make
a decision on my own,

11:10.704 --> 11:12.639
and I decided to do
some more research.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.975
Shaun, you need to learn
how to do this,

11:15.008 --> 11:16.643
and stalling
just makes it worse.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.418
I think maybe you're feeling
bad about your date,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.587
and you're in here
burying yourself in things

11:27.620 --> 11:29.823
you subconsciously think
you can control.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.625
How do people know what's 
going on in their subconscious?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.364
What happened, Shaun,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.033
when you jumped up?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.274
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> Fallen in love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i> </font>

11:47.307 --> 11:49.676
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> In love with someone,
ever fallen in love</i> </font>

11:49.709 --> 11:50.978
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> In love with someone</i> </font>

11:51.011 --> 11:52.545
<font color="#ffff00"> <i> You shouldn't
have fallen in love with </i> </font>

12:00.220 --> 12:02.089
Your phone is ringing.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.858
It can wait.
Mm.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.526
It's your mother.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.028
It can wait.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.863
What went wrong?
What was the disaster?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
She called earlier, too.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.600
If stalling is bad,
then why are you

12:13.633 --> 12:15.235
avoiding your
mother's calls?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.742
Did you ever forgive your mother
for not protecting you?

12:22.776 --> 12:25.745
Is that what your mother
wants to know?

12:25.779 --> 12:27.347
My mother was
a terrible mother.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.582
It wasn't all her fault.
She was bipolar.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.519
That doesn't change the fact
that she was terrible.

12:32.552 --> 12:36.356
I... I don't think it's good
for her to be in my life.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.697
Are you looking
for guidance...

12:44.731 --> 12:45.933
From me?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.639
Am I a role model
to you?

12:55.542 --> 12:57.310
On some issues,
absolutely.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.223
I don't usually think
about the past.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.324
It doesn't help.

13:15.829 --> 13:16.997
But the date.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.331
Mm-mm.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.733
Yesterday is part
of the past,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.170
and the past matters.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.404
What happened?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.879
I... Told a joke.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.780
No.
Yes.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.748
Lea said I should.

13:35.782 --> 13:39.052
No. That is not
what I said.

13:39.086 --> 13:40.720
Does this tie
look good?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.655
Yes. But not
with those pants.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.291
And what I was saying
was that jokes are

13:44.324 --> 13:46.726
the types of things
people do on dates.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.728
They talk about
the weather, hobbies,

13:48.761 --> 13:50.030
where they went
to college.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.564
I'm a person.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.533
Should I change my pants
with you in the room?

13:53.566 --> 13:54.801
No.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.436
And, yes, I know
you're a person, Shaun,

13:56.469 --> 13:58.105
but we all have strengths
and weaknesses.

13:58.138 --> 14:01.774
Telling jokes is easy.
There are books full of them.

14:01.808 --> 14:02.842
I said no.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.778
Yes, there are
a lot of jokes,

14:05.812 --> 14:07.948
but you have to know
how to tell them.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.283
You have to know
when to tell them.

14:11.651 --> 14:15.022
So, I took a gap year
before college, which,

14:15.055 --> 14:17.124
in hindsight, I think
might have been a mistake.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.127
Staying at home.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.528
My relationship
with my dad...

14:21.561 --> 14:23.196
Caesar walked
into a bar

14:23.230 --> 14:25.665
and asked the bartender
for a martinus.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.135
The bartender said,
"Do you mean a martini?"

14:28.168 --> 14:29.536
And Caesar says,
"If I wanted two,

14:29.569 --> 14:30.837
"I would have
ordered two."

14:32.539 --> 14:35.208
Uh... Did she laugh?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.010
I'm not sure.
Well, what did she say?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.588
SHAUN: She made a sound.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.690
"Heh.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.858
"Heh heh heh."

14:51.891 --> 14:53.293
You got a chuckle,
I think.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.561
That's... That's good.
No, it's not.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.164
I read six joke books,
and all I got was a...

14:57.197 --> 14:58.465
"Heh. Heh, heh, heh."

14:58.498 --> 14:59.532
It was a disaster.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.001
Because of a joke?

15:03.836 --> 15:06.506
Something bigger
must have gone wrong.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.674
What happened?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.417
A young woman
may be dying.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.286
I have a lot
of research to do.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.172
Boom. My chart, my case,
my patient, my surgery.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.240
You took it from me.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.574
It touched my fingers.
I know it did.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.675
And then you
took it from me.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.011
All I know is I'm the one
holding the chart.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.378
That's the evidence
we got to deal with.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.446
If you could prove...
Angles.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.614
We need more angles.

15:47.647 --> 15:48.982
How many cameras
do we have in that section?

15:59.326 --> 16:02.129
Dr. Lim,I'm glad you made that
decision on the overtime.

16:02.162 --> 16:03.296
Oh. You're welcome.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.098
But I thought you'd want to know
the real issue

16:05.132 --> 16:07.067
isn't the overtime.
It's being understaffed.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.203
We need two more nurses on 
this floor alone, one in ICU...

16:10.237 --> 16:12.139
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you're right,

16:12.172 --> 16:13.973
but we just don't
have the budget.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.477
Excuse me?

16:17.510 --> 16:18.711
Nothing, ma'am.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.513
I gave you the OT.
You're not being fair.

16:20.547 --> 16:21.614
Aren't I?

16:21.648 --> 16:22.882
You told me I was right,

16:22.915 --> 16:24.951
then you told me
you're not gonna do it.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.519
Who's being unfair?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.658
Nobody said this job...

16:48.308 --> 16:49.509
Shaun.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.112
Come with me.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.986
Is everything okay?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.888
The nurse told us
you didn't finish the surgery.

17:06.626 --> 17:07.993
Suzanne...

17:10.563 --> 17:14.334
3...you have
very extensive cancer

17:15.367 --> 17:17.036
throughout your
abdomen.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.743
It appears
to be malignant.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.079
(SOBS)

17:30.983 --> 17:36.656
And it appears to have metastasized
around every organ.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.901
But there's hope
with surgery.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.782
We can't see the retrohepatic
part of the cancer because of the liver.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.585
We can't see the retroperitoneal part
because of the right kidney.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.887
Yes, I know. That's why we should
take out the organs.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.760
You want to remove
her liver and right kidney?

18:13.793 --> 18:17.364
Yes. And also her left kidney
and her pancreas

18:17.397 --> 18:19.532
and her intestinal tract
and the stomach.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.034
You do know that several of those organs
are quite essential.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.236
We'll put them back.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.107
We remove them,
clean up the cancer,

18:28.141 --> 18:29.142
then put them back.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.912
Ex vivo surgery.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.714
It's been done
for pancreatic cancer.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.782
Without much success.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.285
No. You think it'd work
better here?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.687
Not really.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.989
But the alternative
is death.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.274
Hi.
Hi.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.609
How are you?

19:02.642 --> 19:03.776
Good.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.547
N-Not working?

19:07.580 --> 19:08.915
Yeah.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.050
It's been 72 hours,
and I still haven't found a job.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.785
Relax.
I'll be fine.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.922
I got some irons in the fire.
What do you need?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.725
How do you say no
to a person?

19:18.758 --> 19:20.260
I don't think
I'm doing it right.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.995
Okay.
Watch closely.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.775
Really?

19:35.808 --> 19:36.976
If you're gonna
give up that easily,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.645
you might as well
just quit now.

19:48.788 --> 19:52.191
The biopsy confirmed that the kidney cancer is
a renal cell carcinoma.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.161
Cancer?
I have cancer?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.663
Yes.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.198
Why didn't you tell me?

19:59.832 --> 20:01.434
We did.

20:01.468 --> 20:04.003
The good news is that
it's treatable with surgery

20:04.036 --> 20:05.838
and immunotherapy
and radiation.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.940
We have to tell
the children.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.108
The children know.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.377
How do they know?

20:11.811 --> 20:12.912
What's going on?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.682
Am I dying?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.450
The cancer is serious,
but...

20:17.484 --> 20:19.586
Ruby, we'd like to
talk to you outside.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.025
I'll be right back.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.866
The problem isn't
how you said no.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.635
The problem is how
you said yes.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.270
She seemed quite happy
with the yes.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.505
It came too quickly.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.006
You made her think
she was helping you

20:40.039 --> 20:41.140
instead of the
other way around,

20:41.173 --> 20:42.241
so she came
asking for more,

20:42.275 --> 20:43.710
feeling she was
entitled to more.

20:44.777 --> 20:47.814
So I should have said no
when I wanted to say yes?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.416
You shouldn't tell her
what you want to tell her.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.217
You should tell her
what she needs to hear.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.754
See, it's your job to figure out
what you can give them,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.489
convince them
that's what they need,

20:56.523 --> 20:58.190
and then make them feel
like they owe you.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.528
N-None of that sounds
like me.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.363
And you want to
do the job your way,

21:03.396 --> 21:05.164
without changing
who you are?

21:05.197 --> 21:07.900
Is that amusing to you?
Yes, I do.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.037
Yesterday,
you were an attending.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.905
Today, you're Chief.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.441
You are
a different person.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.944
Want an espresso?

21:22.382 --> 21:23.783
Without surgery,
your husband would

21:23.816 --> 21:25.585
probably live another
two to five years.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.388
He would have
very little discomfort

21:28.421 --> 21:32.191
until very close to the end,
and that can be managed.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.226
You said
it was treatable. It is.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.363
But fighting cancer's
never easy.

21:36.396 --> 21:40.266
We have to weigh the benefits
against the suffering,

21:40.299 --> 21:43.870
and the surgery itself
is usually the easiest part.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.372
He's strong.
He's healthy.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.640
He's not healthy.
Not mentally.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.042
And the burden
on you...

21:50.076 --> 21:53.045
I am not letting
my husband die

21:53.079 --> 21:55.582
because caring for him
is inconvenient,

21:55.615 --> 21:58.651
because I'm gonna have to
repeat a conversation.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.387
Just go to hell.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.629
This type of surgery's never 
been done for this condition.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.131
We'd be dealing with every one
of your abdominal organs,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.601
and something could
go wrong with any of them.

22:14.634 --> 22:18.971
You could be on dialysis for
the rest of your life.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.442
You could have a very compromised
digestive tract,

22:22.475 --> 22:24.110
lifelong diabetes.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.978
You could
have liver failure.

22:28.147 --> 22:29.949
That's not
a complete list.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.451
You could die.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.590
And, um,

22:37.624 --> 22:39.191
if we don't
do the surgery?

22:39.225 --> 22:41.093
Chemotherapy
and radiation.

22:41.127 --> 22:44.897
Although the likelihood of
success is slim, about 25%.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.300
You may prefer
hospice care.

22:49.636 --> 22:51.804
You'd probably live
maybe a year,

22:51.838 --> 22:53.039
but it'd be a good year.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.752
Could you give us
some time to think about it?

23:06.753 --> 23:08.254
Of course.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.907
We're supposed
to be at lunch.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.642
We're gonna be late.

23:29.676 --> 23:30.977
Why?

23:31.010 --> 23:33.646
Why? Because I need
meaning in my life.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.747
Your heart seems fine.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.484
Your liver seems to be
in the right place.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.052
You're a brain surgeon.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.756
You don't think you can get 
meaning being a brain surgeon?

23:43.790 --> 23:46.626
This is a boring patient
with boring symptoms.

23:50.296 --> 23:52.031
Shaun,
meet Marco Higgins,

23:52.064 --> 23:54.233
diesel mechanic,
currently in between jobs.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.402
Three sons, two of whom
he hasn't spoken to

23:56.435 --> 23:58.370
in quite some time,
but he's working on that.

23:58.404 --> 23:59.606
Open.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.575
Wide.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.577
It's good to get
to know people, Shaun.

24:04.611 --> 24:05.945
It makes you
a better doctor.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.179
Say, "Ah."

24:07.213 --> 24:09.215
Ah.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.552
You have boring symptoms.
That's a good thing.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.420
You do not want
exciting symptoms.

24:16.255 --> 24:17.790
You had a date last night,
didn't you?

24:18.891 --> 24:20.426
Mm. I want to hear
about this.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.662
Marco, you want to
hear about this?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.364
Yes, please.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.466
Yes, please.
Open.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.042
It was a disaster.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.381
Oh, thank you, Shaun,
but it's really not...

24:42.414 --> 24:43.550
No, it's polite
and chivalrous...

24:44.784 --> 24:47.419
...and even though chivalry
is a problematic notion,

24:47.453 --> 24:49.155
politeness is a good thing,
no matter which...

24:49.188 --> 24:50.389
Ohh!
Shaun!

24:51.824 --> 24:53.593
Are you okay?
Oh, my.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.962
I'm okay.
She might not be okay.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.798
No, I am okay.
Okay. Don't get up.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.499
I'm pretty sure
she's okay.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.037
Take off his boots.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.106
What?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.275
Do you think
Marco's diabetic?

25:09.308 --> 25:12.812
Based on the color of his skin in 
the crease of his neck, I do.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.147
Based on what it says
on his chart, I do, too.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.483
He could have
an infection in his feet,

25:17.516 --> 25:20.252
and the pain is being masked
by diabetic neuropathy.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.189
That infection could be causing
the abdominal symptoms.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.959
Marco, would you mind
taking off your boots?

25:45.244 --> 25:47.680
I was wrong.
It's not boring.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.489
I can do it myself.

25:57.523 --> 26:00.960
I'm sure,
but our job here
is to help each other,

26:00.993 --> 26:03.696
and today
I didn't do that.

26:05.431 --> 26:08.234
I'm trying to make up for that
with a jar of pickles.

26:13.505 --> 26:16.042
I overstepped and...

26:16.075 --> 26:18.210
...undercut you in front
of the patient's wife.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.815
I accept your apology.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.283
What I should have done

26:26.218 --> 26:27.720
was privately tell you
that you're wrong.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.356
Give me the jar back.

26:30.389 --> 26:31.423
And let you,
as lead doctor,

26:31.457 --> 26:33.292
tell them that
this surgery's a bad idea.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.029
Because we should let
a 70-year-old man die

26:37.063 --> 26:38.497
of a treatable
condition?

26:38.530 --> 26:40.066
Because we shouldn't
condemn a 70-year-old man

26:40.099 --> 26:41.868
to years of confusion
and fear.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.070
His life
still has value.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.574
Seriously?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.977
He has memory issues.
He's not a vegetable.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.580
He's funny,
he's charming.

26:55.648 --> 26:57.383
They've lived
a life together.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.421
He brings happiness to his wife,
to his children.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.224
He's happy.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.592
Exactly.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.195
Let him stay happy
for whatever time he has left.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.312
Nurse Petringa.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.082
I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.084
I didn't track you down
for an apology.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.386
You gonna get us
the additional staff?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.055
No.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.724
If I get you
the additional staff,

27:37.757 --> 27:39.491
you lose hours,
you lose overtime.

27:39.525 --> 27:41.560
So you're doing us
a favor by making sure

27:41.593 --> 27:43.495
we never
see our families?

27:43.529 --> 27:44.997
Your problem
isn't the staff.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.432
Your problem
is the actual work,

27:46.465 --> 27:49.702
the crap part of the work
that takes too long and too many of you.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.473
I authorized the purchase
of two Hoya patient lifts

27:54.506 --> 27:56.475
and a mechatronic
ICU bed.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.144
A smart bed?

28:01.613 --> 28:03.282
Those are actually
supposed to be kind of fun.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.584
You got to promise
to let me try it.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.486
You got it.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.522
Dr. Lim?

28:11.390 --> 28:12.491
Thank you.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.160
You owe me.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.133
I'm well aware of what
he'll be going through.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.534
My sister had cancer.

28:24.003 --> 28:25.671
The chemo,
the radiation...

28:27.840 --> 28:29.541
They beat the crap out of her,
didn't they?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.378
Yeah.

28:33.579 --> 28:36.015
Now imagine
going through that

28:36.048 --> 28:39.418
and not understanding,
every day.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.056
Throwing up
and not knowing why,

28:45.457 --> 28:47.994
losing your hair
and not knowing why,

28:49.561 --> 28:53.900
learning he has cancer
and being devastated by it

28:53.933 --> 28:55.534
day after day.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.836
But at the end...

28:56.869 --> 28:58.370
There are
no guarantees.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.943
He's old, and his
body's breaking down.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.415
His mind
is breaking down,

29:11.617 --> 29:15.187
and it's gonna end,
no matter what we do.

29:22.561 --> 29:25.932
In 45 years, I have never
once lied to him.

29:31.237 --> 29:35.307
When memory goes,
all that's left is emotion.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.678
What we've learned
doesn't matter.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.249
What we had for lunch,
where we went for vacation,

29:44.951 --> 29:46.385
none of it matters.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.389
But how we feel,

29:52.458 --> 29:54.060
who we're close to...

29:57.129 --> 29:59.431
He's the same man
I've always loved.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.469
Same sense of humor.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.006
Same everything.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.609
He hasn't changed.

30:13.980 --> 30:18.184
And what I owe him
hasn't changed.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.656
Have you decided?

30:24.690 --> 30:26.225
Not yet.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.427
Take your time.
There is no urgency to...

30:28.460 --> 30:29.795
What are
you waiting for?

30:31.497 --> 30:34.934
Dr. Murphy, they are kind of 
facing an impossible choice.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.335
But they
have to make it.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.874
What additional information
are you waiting for?

30:41.908 --> 30:43.609
Shaun...
I'll be a better doctor

30:43.642 --> 30:45.177
if I understand
the patient.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.013
True, but right now, your skills 
are secondary to their...

30:47.046 --> 30:51.250
Are you debating whether you 
should find somebody else

30:51.283 --> 30:54.286
to fall in love with,
someone healthy?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.388
No.
No, of course not.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.690
You should be.

31:02.761 --> 31:03.896
We're kids.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.033
You shouldn't have to
spend the rest of your life

31:07.066 --> 31:08.567
taking care
of an invalid.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.837
You think that's
the issue?

31:12.704 --> 31:14.840
Me?
A-A burden on me?

31:15.841 --> 31:18.110
This is so much easier
on me than you.

31:18.144 --> 31:19.745
No, it's not.

31:23.682 --> 31:26.085
Whatever happens to me
is gonna happen,

31:27.519 --> 31:29.821
and I have to
live with it.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.994
You...

31:35.027 --> 31:36.929
You have a choice.

31:42.534 --> 31:45.171
"In sickness
and in health."

31:47.306 --> 31:49.108
That was the commitment
I made...

31:51.877 --> 31:53.612
This morning.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.318
Now, if this had
happened yesterday...

32:06.959 --> 32:09.996
So, it's not that difficult
a decision then, right?

32:14.933 --> 32:15.934
I guess not.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.932
I can feel her humeral head 
outside the glenoid fossa.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.536
It's an anterior
dislocation.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.271
I can reduce that.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.372
Here?

32:53.405 --> 32:56.442
Yes, with traction
and external rotation.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.410
Ow!

33:00.279 --> 33:03.415
Oh. Oh.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.484
Oh, my, that... That...
That feels better.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.652
I bumped you.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.287
Oh, d-d-don't worry.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.589
It happens. I-I wasn't watching,
either.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.528
Come on.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.466
That's it?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.469
You bumped into
a very understanding woman,

33:23.502 --> 33:26.605
you amazingly caught
a bottle of wine.

33:26.638 --> 33:27.873
Where was the disaster?

33:31.043 --> 33:33.345
Unclamp the superior mesenteric
to perfuse the organs.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.892
The small intestines
look dusky and cyanotic.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.995
We'll need to resect
all the necrotic segments.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.198
Claire, find the first
viable part of the ilium

33:52.231 --> 33:53.332
and clamp proximal
to it.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.315
I don't think your irons
in the fire are very hot.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.585
Any job interviews you get,
you're gonna spend

34:13.619 --> 34:15.853
a large chunk of time
trying to explain why

34:15.887 --> 34:18.623
you lasted less than a year as President
at St. Bonaventure.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.293
I mean, how do you put
a positive spin on

34:21.327 --> 34:23.161
why you spent a fortune
on a Chief of Surgery

34:23.195 --> 34:26.132
you fired weeks later
to protect a second-year resident?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.233
You think
I made a mistake?

34:27.266 --> 34:29.501
No, I think you did
the right thing.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.704
I admire you, which is why
I want to do you a favor.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.244
What you need to dois prove that you haven't
burned any bridges,

34:38.277 --> 34:41.112
which means you have to come back to work
at St. Bonaventure.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.184
As what? As a surgeon
working for you?

34:46.618 --> 34:48.754
And the fact that you're
undoubtedly in need of

34:48.786 --> 34:51.757
a surgical attending to replace yourself
is just a coincidence?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.293
It's what you need.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.697
I admire the effort.

34:58.730 --> 35:00.766
But don't con a con man.

35:11.543 --> 35:14.045
Your greatest strength
and your greatest weakness

35:14.079 --> 35:16.081
as a leader
was your stubbornness.

35:16.114 --> 35:18.217
Don't let it be
a weakness today.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.156
My back hurts
on the left side.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.892
That's where
you had your biopsy.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.194
It's gonna hurt
for a little while.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.428
What biopsy?

35:32.264 --> 35:34.700
Harvey, you came in here
because you thought you had kidney stones.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.169
We did some imaging,
and you don't.

35:37.203 --> 35:39.305
What is it? What...
What's wrong?

35:41.106 --> 35:44.643
What?
What's going on, Ruby?

35:45.110 --> 35:46.144
I...

35:47.179 --> 35:49.281
Why isn't anybody
saying anything?

35:52.251 --> 35:53.519
Am I dying?

35:54.953 --> 35:56.121
Ruby?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.624
I... I can't die.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.159
I need to
take care of you.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.861
I... I can't...

36:04.029 --> 36:05.464
They didn't
find stones.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.536
Everything is okay.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.775
The pain will go away.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.877
We're gonna
go home tonight.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.182
Okay? Okay?

36:48.206 --> 36:49.508
I had a nice time.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.270
That's it?

37:19.738 --> 37:20.972
It's over?

37:21.006 --> 37:22.908
Where's the disaster?

37:22.941 --> 37:24.310
I've listened to
an hour of this.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.677
I was promised
a disaster.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.178
Where's the disaster?

37:30.616 --> 37:33.251
It...was exhausting.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.858
Everything was always
out of control.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.495
Anything could happen
at any time.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.763
Anything did.

37:46.698 --> 37:49.200
There was too much
to remember to do,

37:49.234 --> 37:51.269
too much to
remember not to do,

37:51.303 --> 37:52.704
and none of it made sense.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.909
It was hard, uncomfortable,
unpleasant.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.712
I spent the whole evening
doing unnatural things

38:00.746 --> 38:03.615
to make her happy, and I have
no idea if she was happy,

38:03.649 --> 38:06.618
and I know I wasn't happy.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.228
It was all a disaster.

38:24.770 --> 38:28.106
I want you to meet our new attending,
Dr. Marcus Andrews.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.379
Pleasure to meet you.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.917
How long have
you been working here?

38:40.486 --> 38:41.620
Ms. McDougal?

38:41.653 --> 38:42.921
She didn't ask for ID.

38:42.954 --> 38:43.989
It's policy.

38:44.022 --> 38:45.757
We take a lot
of immigrants here.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.125
She also
didn't look at me.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.594
Check the symptom
I told her I had...

38:49.661 --> 38:51.430
A cut
over the left eye.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.399
You heal very nicely,
Ms. McDougal.

38:53.432 --> 38:56.001
You hate it here.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.969
"Hate" is a strong word.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.938
What would you do
differently?

39:02.307 --> 39:03.609
Give me five things.

39:04.610 --> 39:08.179
Diabetes clinical educator,
onsite lab and X-ray,

39:08.213 --> 39:10.682
mental health advisor,
multidisciplinary care team,

39:10.716 --> 39:12.183
electronic
medical records.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.085
We had the clinic
at the hospital

39:14.119 --> 39:16.922
and had to shut it down
because it was a money pit.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.891
Come back as President,
and we'll re-open it.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.231
Your office can be
in the clinic.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.634
Do I have to wear a tie?

39:37.543 --> 39:38.577
Hey.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.079
Welcome back.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.682
Am I okay?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.283
The surgery
went very well.

39:45.316 --> 39:47.252
We're confident that
we got all of the cancer.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.291
There's a bag
by her side.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.193
Is that just to drain
stuff post-surgery?

39:55.226 --> 39:57.663
There were
complications.

39:57.696 --> 40:00.165
We had to remove
a large portion of your bowel

40:00.198 --> 40:02.768
and divert the waste
through a stoma in your skin.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.269
That's an ileostomy bag.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.505
How long
will I have that?

40:07.873 --> 40:08.940
Forever.

40:11.076 --> 40:12.478
So I have to go
to the bathroom

40:12.511 --> 40:13.945
in this thing
for the rest of my life?

40:14.345 --> 40:16.247
Yes.

40:16.281 --> 40:19.618
We'll teach you how to change it,
how to dispose of it.

40:21.587 --> 40:23.054
They'll teach both of us.

40:34.766 --> 40:37.135
Now, this is
why we do it, Shaun.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.238
Every date is a disaster.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.207
Every relationship
is out of control.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.678
But if you stick with it,
you wind up with someone

40:46.712 --> 40:50.248
in your life who will help you
when you need to be helped,

40:50.281 --> 40:53.885
love you when
you do not feel lovable,

40:53.919 --> 40:55.787
be with you
no matter what.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.294
It's not worth it.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.635
Hi, Mom.

41:11.436 --> 41:12.804
My son's coming
to town.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.172
Think I'll pick him up
at the airport.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.183

41:55.781 --> 41:59.384
