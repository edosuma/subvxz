WEBVTT

00:00.217 --> 00:03.452
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:03.521 --> 00:06.721
<i>Ratchet, what happened to
Bumblebee's voice box? </i>

00:06.791 --> 00:11.527
<i>Our brave scout was captured
by Megatron's forces and interrogated.</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.395
<i>Bumblebee was left for scrap,</i>

00:13.464 --> 00:16.899
<i>where a field medic managed to
stabilize his condition.</i>

00:16.968 --> 00:20.202
Though, the medic 
could've done better.

00:20.271 --> 00:21.437
<i>By the Allspark.</i>

00:21.505 --> 00:24.773
<i>Bumblebee's T-cog isn't damaged.
It's missing.</i>

00:24.842 --> 00:26.675
Is that like a... T-bone?

00:26.744 --> 00:29.912
It's the organ that allows us
to scan vehicles and transform.

00:29.981 --> 00:31.180
Why are you here?

00:31.248 --> 00:33.849
To propose an alliance.

00:33.918 --> 00:38.253
A T-cog isn't technology ...
it is biology.

00:38.322 --> 00:42.124
We possess two more sets of
coordinates which Orion

00:42.193 --> 00:44.927
decrypted before departing our ranks.

00:44.996 --> 00:51.467
Let us see what other long-lost
treasures we might be reunited with.

00:58.743 --> 01:01.796
<b>2x05 - Operation Bumblebee
part 2</b>

01:02.579 --> 01:06.548
Of all the scrap-brained ideas ...
taking Bumblebee 

01:06.617 --> 01:08.717
into a potential chase scenario when he

01:08.786 --> 01:11.887
no longer has the ability to
access his wheels?!

01:11.956 --> 01:15.257
- He improvised.
- Hey, Bee's waking up.

01:17.561 --> 01:20.729
You've already lost your
voice box and your T-cog.

01:20.798 --> 01:23.966
Were you really trying to add
your Spark to the list?

01:25.903 --> 01:29.071
Don't say that, Bumblebee.
You're not useless.

01:29.140 --> 01:32.875
Look, I hate to break up the
pity party, but the 'Cons just

01:32.943 --> 01:36.378
added unknown Iacon payday
number two to their armory.

01:36.447 --> 01:40.482
Neither blame nor praise will
modify past events,

01:40.551 --> 01:44.787
but we cannot afford to take
further unnecessary risks.

01:44.855 --> 01:50.392
Bumblebee, you are not to leave
our base ... not until we can

01:50.461 --> 01:53.562
retrieve your missing biomechanism.

01:59.302 --> 02:02.638
Bumblebee is right to be less
than hopeful, but you and I both

02:02.706 --> 02:05.908
know there exists a way to make
him whole again.

02:05.976 --> 02:10.145
A transplant, but that would
require a donor.

02:12.282 --> 02:16.819
You need look no further than
the Autobot standing before you.

02:57.730 --> 03:02.100
A generous offer, old friend,
but your solution would merely 

03:02.169 --> 03:04.736
trade one Autobot's handicap for another's.

03:04.805 --> 03:08.740
I don't rely upon my T-cog ...
not like Bumblebee does.

03:08.809 --> 03:12.477
The ability to transform is
virtually wasted on me.

03:12.546 --> 03:16.815
This is where I spend my days,
where my thoughts and hands are of value, 

03:16.883 --> 03:20.618
not my weapons or wheels.

03:20.687 --> 03:25.890
Our team can't afford to be shy
even one warrior in the field.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.226
You make a compelling case,

03:28.295 --> 03:31.796
but know that we will find
Bumblebee's T-cog.

03:31.997 --> 03:37.135
Optimus, MECH are savages.
Who knows what damage they may

03:37.204 --> 03:43.141
have already inflicted upon it or ...
or if I will be able to repair it?

03:43.210 --> 03:47.846
Ratchet, you did everything
in your power.

03:48.982 --> 03:49.647
Please.

03:49.716 --> 03:51.482
Do you really think this is

03:51.551 --> 03:55.453
simply about my inability to
restore Bumblebee's voice box?

03:58.457 --> 04:03.661
I... I just want to do what's
right for our scout...

04:03.730 --> 04:05.597
for the team.

04:09.935 --> 04:12.570
Ahh.
Excellent work, Knockout.

04:12.639 --> 04:17.976
I live to serve, Lord Megatron.
But what exactly is it?

04:23.516 --> 04:24.849
Now you know.

04:24.918 --> 04:29.220
I... think I leaked a little
transmission fluid.

04:33.026 --> 04:36.094
Source located.

04:36.162 --> 04:39.264
Yes, gratifying, isn't it, Silas?

04:39.332 --> 04:43.534
I often advised Megatron to seek
out human allies.

04:43.603 --> 04:49.407
After all, it seems to provide
the Autobots with an occasional edge.

04:49.476 --> 04:54.880
But despite his reputation
as a brilliant strategist, 

04:54.948 --> 04:59.984
Megatron is woefully small-minded 
when it comes to working with minds

05:00.053 --> 05:03.087
smaller than our own.

05:03.156 --> 05:07.759
I was simply referring to head size.

05:07.827 --> 05:10.595
Do you ever not speak?

05:13.133 --> 05:18.036
Did I mention that I've
personally extinguished an Autobot?

05:23.475 --> 05:27.578
Energon in its purest state.

05:27.647 --> 05:29.213
Ready to be mined.

05:29.282 --> 05:36.755
And processed, my flesh-covered
compatriot, to give us the edge.

05:39.725 --> 05:42.994
Obviously, since I am the
other patient involved,

05:43.063 --> 05:45.396
I will be unable
to perform the surgery.

05:45.465 --> 05:50.001
Therefore, one of you must
serve as my proxy.

05:52.938 --> 05:55.540
Better at breaking things.

05:55.608 --> 05:57.475
Phew!

05:57.544 --> 06:01.612
- Arcee.
- Optimus has steadier hands.

06:01.681 --> 06:05.984
Steady and much too large
to be rooting around beneath my hood.

06:08.588 --> 06:11.789
Arcee, you can do this.
You're as steely as they come.

06:11.858 --> 06:14.592
On a battlefield, not in an
operating theater.

06:14.661 --> 06:18.629
Same thing, as long as you're
behind the knife, not under it.

06:19.632 --> 06:22.266
Does this mean Bumblebee's
gonna transform into

06:22.335 --> 06:25.403
an ambulance from now on
or be all cranky?

06:25.472 --> 06:27.605
'Cause that would be weird.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.442
Inducing stasis.

06:37.917 --> 06:41.285
You can...

06:41.354 --> 06:42.841
thank me when...

06:42.879 --> 06:44.372
it's over.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.526
Okay, Bumblebee.
Your turn.

06:52.232 --> 06:53.831
What's happening?!

06:53.900 --> 06:55.733
Ratchet's flatlining!

06:55.802 --> 06:56.834
No, he isn't.

06:57.971 --> 06:59.771
It's an Iacon homing beacon.

06:59.839 --> 07:02.793
If we're picking up the
signal, it means the 'Cons just

07:02.809 --> 07:04.742
unearthed another relic.

07:04.811 --> 07:09.580
- Autobots, prepare to roll out.
- Yes!

07:12.652 --> 07:15.520
Except for our patients.

07:17.424 --> 07:20.058
It would be best to interrupt stasis.

07:36.009 --> 07:38.076
<i>Prime! Breaking news.</i>

07:40.013 --> 07:42.547
<i>Huh?
Where's Prime?</i>

07:45.251 --> 07:50.588
<i>Look, let him know ... I just
received access to satellite</i>

07:50.657 --> 07:58.196
<i>imagery which I believe pinpoints
the center of operations of MECH.</i>

08:08.726 --> 08:11.793
<i>Oh, for the love of ...
get me someone who speaks </i>

08:11.862 --> 08:13.495
<i>something other than "bleep"!</i>

08:13.563 --> 08:14.662
I can help.

08:14.731 --> 08:18.834
<i>What? Do I hear
a fuzor in need of voice-box repair?</i>

08:18.903 --> 08:23.372
<i>What's a fuzor?!
What's going on over there?</i>

08:23.440 --> 08:27.075
I am able.
Just ask Bantor.

08:27.144 --> 08:32.347
He was all mandrel before I put
a tiger in his tank.

08:38.422 --> 08:41.923
But, Bee, you heard what
Optimus said about leaving the base.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.693
Send the coordinates, agent Fowler.

08:45.762 --> 08:49.097
We'll... make sure Optimus gets them.

09:08.885 --> 09:12.687
I don't get it.
All this chipping away with my hammer

09:12.756 --> 09:15.957
just to bring Megatron
another hammer?

09:16.026 --> 09:21.262
That hammer is a sacred relic
of the 13 original Primes.

09:21.331 --> 09:22.096
Really?

09:22.165 --> 09:25.767
Isn't that the opposite of
decepticon Doomsday device?

09:25.836 --> 09:29.137
It would stand to reason that
in addition to confiscated

09:29.146 --> 09:33.208
decepticon artillery, any
artifacts of great significance

09:33.276 --> 09:37.812
stored in the Vaults of Iacon
would also have been shipped off world.

09:37.881 --> 09:43.450
And none would be greater than this 
... the forge of Solus Prime ... 

09:43.718 --> 09:47.188
for it possesses the power to mystically infuse

09:47.257 --> 09:49.657
raw material with working mechanisms.

09:49.726 --> 09:51.926
As in, if we had it, we could

09:51.995 --> 09:54.629
pound any weapon we can dream of
into existence?

09:54.698 --> 10:01.236
Or possibly construct a new
T-cog for Bumblebee.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.417
Initiate transfusion.

10:31.868 --> 10:33.535
It's working.

10:33.603 --> 10:38.374
Energon, it will do wonders
for our future army.

10:41.410 --> 10:44.245
Your future army.

10:44.314 --> 10:46.947
In fact, we are mere moments

10:47.016 --> 10:50.018
from beholding the miracle
of transformation.

11:07.670 --> 11:10.972
No T-cog.
He's unarmed.

11:35.598 --> 11:38.600
Time to get a grip.

12:01.724 --> 12:05.326
Autobots, check out my new
finished protector.

12:42.464 --> 12:44.832
So close, and yet...

12:44.901 --> 12:47.335
Our location and prototype
have been compromised.

12:47.404 --> 12:50.070
Destroy the intruder and meet me
at the rendezvous point ...

12:50.138 --> 12:51.739
with my T-cog.

12:51.808 --> 12:54.542
I am not one of your foot soldiers!

12:54.611 --> 12:57.712
I am a consultant!

13:06.121 --> 13:11.759
One step, and your precious
biomech is scrap.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.708
Ratchet, how you feeling? 

13:32.812 --> 13:38.216
Fine. In fact, I feel
as though nothing's changed.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.818
<i>Prime!</i>

13:40.887 --> 13:42.420
What is it, agent Fowler?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.423
<i>Has Prime reached the coordinates?</i>

13:44.491 --> 13:45.757
Coordinates?

13:45.826 --> 13:49.494
Possible MECH location!
I sent them a half-hour ago!

13:49.563 --> 13:52.697
Uh, don't worry, agent Fowler.
It's taken care of.

13:52.766 --> 13:55.734
Optimus had to go lock
fenders with some 'Cons.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.169
So, Bumblebee went instead.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.072
What?!
Bumblebee can't do that!

14:01.141 --> 14:03.541
He's recovering from surgery!

14:03.610 --> 14:05.477
About that...

14:11.418 --> 14:14.385
Or you'll what?
Shoot?

14:15.922 --> 14:20.925
How sad ... to be incapable of
achieving vehicle mode,

14:20.994 --> 14:24.796
experiencing the sensation of speed.

14:24.864 --> 14:30.235
How very pathetic ... to be
a failure as an Autobot.

14:58.664 --> 15:02.133
Time to jet ... because I can!

15:27.759 --> 15:28.993
My T-cog.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.931
Yes, that.
Unfortunately, it was destroyed

15:32.932 --> 15:38.402
during the ferocity of battle.
A, uh... a temporary setback.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.771
Other Autobots, other T-cogs.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.008
We shall find a replacement
soon enough.

15:44.077 --> 15:48.279
Not "soon enough."
Now!

16:02.861 --> 16:06.630
For the most creative use of
a shield generator in a supporting role,

16:06.699 --> 16:09.901
the winner is Knockout.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.711
Mine's bigger.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.369
Bulkhead!

17:27.145 --> 17:29.380
No-o-o.

17:33.819 --> 17:38.789
A relic of the Primes here on Earth?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.660
The decepticon cause is once again 

17:41.669 --> 17:45.663
indebted to the contributions of Orion Pax.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.510
I'm fine.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.680
<i>Optimus, we have reason to believe 
we have located MECH's center of operations.</i>

18:03.749 --> 18:06.584
<i>Bumblebee is already there.</i>

18:14.994 --> 18:17.328
What?

18:37.316 --> 18:40.284
Autobots!

18:45.692 --> 18:48.693
My T-cog!

19:02.475 --> 19:07.178
Ratchet, reopen the ground
bridge and prepare for surgery.

19:08.381 --> 19:11.449
Thanks to me,
Megatron has the forge.

19:11.517 --> 19:15.519
While we would've put the
forge of Solus Prime to valuable use,

19:15.588 --> 19:21.058
I do not believe we have reason
to fear Megatron's possession of it.

19:32.003 --> 19:34.271
Hmm. It doesn't look like

19:34.340 --> 19:37.141
a fortress-maximus grade 
nucleon shock cannon.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.343
It is as I suspected ...

19:39.412 --> 19:43.781
without the power of a Prime to
activate it, the forge is merely

19:43.850 --> 19:46.484
another addition to our tool chest.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.519
One we must nonetheless 
keep as far as possible 

19:49.688 --> 19:52.857
from the reach of a Prime.

20:01.800 --> 20:06.003
I... did what I could.

20:06.072 --> 20:10.274
Our scout could not have been
in better hands, old friend.

20:10.343 --> 20:12.175
And we didn't stick with plan "A" 

20:12.176 --> 20:14.912
and let Ratchet donate his Cog why?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.680
Bumblebee wouldn't accept it.

20:21.486 --> 20:24.054
Bumblebee! Easy.

20:28.027 --> 20:31.729
Please. Recovery takes time.

20:35.268 --> 20:38.335
The damage was... severe.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.459
Anywhere.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.096
Just... drive.

21:09.835 --> 21:13.570
Go easy!

21:13.639 --> 21:17.441
Adhere to standard 
break-in procedure!

21:17.610 --> 21:18.576
Wh-o-oa!

21:18.644 --> 21:21.912
Bee's T-cog looked like it was
ready for the scrapyard.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.281
Hard to believe the Doc repaired it.

21:24.350 --> 21:29.019
That is not all that
Ratchet repaired today.
