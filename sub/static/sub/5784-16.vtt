WEBVTT

00:03.412 --> 00:05.413
(musical theme)

00:45.111 --> 00:48.347
(grunts)

01:05.398 --> 01:08.467
(dog barking)

01:26.486 --> 01:34.660
(choked groan)

01:52.112 --> 01:54.113
I'll take care of it
as soon as we get back.

01:54.115 --> 01:57.683
Thank you, William.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.119
Are you sure about this?

02:00.121 --> 02:02.387
We could always cancel.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.958
No, the Psychiatry Conference
was planned a year ago.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.562
Some time away from home
may do us both good.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.565
Besides,
I am rather excited

02:13.567 --> 02:16.235
about engaging in debate
on the Keeley methods

02:16.237 --> 02:18.904
for rehabilitating inebriates.
And I am rather excited

02:18.906 --> 02:21.640
to hear you speak about it.
(phone ringing)

02:24.744 --> 02:26.812
Doctor Julia Ogden.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.083
Thank you.

02:33.019 --> 02:35.053
His throat's been slit.

02:35.055 --> 02:37.589
No sign of residual blood
though. That's curious.

02:37.591 --> 02:40.092
He was found in a bathtub
at the House of Industry.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.461
That explains it, then.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.097
I thought you two
were taking some time off.

02:45.099 --> 02:47.099
We've decided
to take a later train.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.401
I'm afraid
circumstances intervened.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.938
So who's this unlucky bloke?
A resident of the House
of Industry,

02:52.940 --> 02:54.940
it would appear.
A pauper then.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.110
Yes, but...
trim beard, sound teeth...

02:58.112 --> 03:00.512
Look at his hands.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.681
Soft, well manicured.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.017
Hardly destitute then.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.219
Anybody can fall down
on their luck, Murdoch.

03:07.221 --> 03:10.189
Here's something.
Look at this.

03:10.191 --> 03:13.292
O, 1, O, 3...

03:13.294 --> 03:15.194
40...

03:15.196 --> 03:19.264
2, 19, F, P.

03:19.266 --> 03:22.067
What does it mean?

03:22.069 --> 03:24.570
I'm no detective,

03:24.572 --> 03:28.607
but I think
it might be a clue.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.284
This is where we found him.

03:39.286 --> 03:42.087
Rather gruesome sight.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.423
Not a lot of privacy.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.592
Someone must
have seen something.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.595
We found him after the men
had retired for the night.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.931
You're welcome to ask around
but I should warn you

03:52.933 --> 03:55.434
the men here have little trust
in the police.

03:55.436 --> 03:59.137
Who was he?
His name was Jefferson Brick.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.608
According to the register,
he arrived two weeks ago.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.310
Where was he from?
I have no idea.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.113
He did his work,
received his meal and bed,

04:08.115 --> 04:10.082
just like all the men here.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.685
Did anyone here have it in
for Mr. Brick?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.721
I wouldn't know.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.823
The men here
keep their own counsel.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.793
Like convicts.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.063
Our residents
are not criminals, Inspector.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.399
They are destitute
and friendless

04:27.401 --> 04:30.068
and have learned to trust
no one but themselves.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.070
For all we know,

04:32.072 --> 04:35.607
they could be Christ among us,
come to test us.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.210
Of course.

04:50.757 --> 04:52.858
Excuse me, gentlemen.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.761
There was a man found dead
in the baths last night.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.730
A man by the name of Brick.
Did either of you know him?

04:58.732 --> 05:02.534
No.
I'm told that you both slept

05:02.536 --> 05:04.703
near his bunk. You must have
talked to him on some occasion.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.039
I had no reason to.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.541
Nor me.

05:09.543 --> 05:13.078
Something else
we can help you with?

05:15.181 --> 05:18.750
They won't talk to you.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.553
And you will?

05:21.555 --> 05:24.489
I didn't say that.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.559
How about a name?
John Dempsey.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.562
Did you know
the dead man, Mr. Dempsey?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.065
I slept
in the next bunk.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.868
What can you tell me
about him?

05:36.870 --> 05:40.605
He snored.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.944
Snored.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.080
William,
it's almost three o'clock,

05:48.082 --> 05:51.049
we need to get...

05:51.051 --> 05:53.518
You don't want to go?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.922
Julia,
a man's been murdered.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.725
I don't feel right turning
my back on the investigation.

05:59.727 --> 06:03.028
I understand.

06:03.030 --> 06:06.198
I'll go on my own.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.267
Are you sure it's wise
to be alone right now?

06:09.269 --> 06:11.536
I'll be fine.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.240
Taking some time apart
might be good for us.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.943
I'll see you
to the train station--

06:17.945 --> 06:20.112
No. I'll manage.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.484
Goodbye, William.

06:28.621 --> 06:31.523
Take care.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.461
(door opens)

06:42.902 --> 06:44.903
I'll tell you, Higgins.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.072
That House of Industry
is a sad place.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.742
Could you imagine toiling
all day just food and a bed?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.744
At least they're not starving.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.780
Even slaves
don't starve, Henry.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.848
What's your point?

06:56.850 --> 06:59.317
If you have to ask
I can't possibly explain it.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.353
Well,

07:01.355 --> 07:03.688
this oughta
cheer you up.

07:03.690 --> 07:07.025
"City facing
growing rat problem."

07:07.027 --> 07:11.163
Below that.
"Banana split..."

07:11.165 --> 07:13.498
They split a banana
lengthwise...

07:13.500 --> 07:17.035
"With ice cream. Topped
with pineapples and nuts..."

07:17.037 --> 07:19.538
They drizzle the whole thing
in a thick chocolate sauce.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.707
My God, Henry.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.810
This could be the best
concoction ever conceived.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.878
Well, they're selling them
down at the Beaches until

07:26.880 --> 07:28.847
their banana supply runs out.
Really?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.348
Crabtree! In my office.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.388
Alright, then.
What have you found out?

07:36.390 --> 07:38.390
Sir, unfortunately,
very little.

07:38.392 --> 07:41.359
None of the men there
wanted to speak to us.
Even the friendly ones.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.562
Not easy for a man
down on his luck

07:43.564 --> 07:46.665
to trust anyone,
much less a copper. Ah, Murdoch!

07:46.667 --> 07:48.733
I thought you were off
with the missus.

07:48.735 --> 07:51.536
Sir, I've decided to stay on.
Then take some time off.

07:51.538 --> 07:54.139
Go home, invent something.
It'll make you feel better.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.174
If it's all
the same, sir,

07:56.176 --> 07:58.210
I believe work will help
to focus my mind.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.212
I know that getting back to it
has always helped me

08:00.214 --> 08:03.849
in times of trouble, sir.
So...

08:03.851 --> 08:05.851
What do we know
about the dead man?

08:05.853 --> 08:07.853
Unfortunately,
not very much, sir.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.888
I've been through city records.
I can find no mention

08:09.890 --> 08:12.023
of a Jefferson Brick.
Perhaps he's from out of town.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.726
Or simply using
a false name.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.661
Jefferson Brick...

08:16.663 --> 08:19.397
Why does that somehow seem--
Familiar.

08:19.399 --> 08:22.067
I felt the same way, sir, but
I've been through city records.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.035
Jefferson Brick
simply doesn't...

08:24.037 --> 08:26.037
Martin Chuzzlewit!

08:26.039 --> 08:28.039
Right!
Chuzzlewit?

08:28.041 --> 08:30.876
Who the hell's that?
It's a Charles Dickens novel.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.778
Of course it is.
Never heard of it.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.047
Well, sir, it's not one
of his better known novels

08:36.049 --> 08:39.184
but very good, very underrated.
Then, why are we discussing
bloody Dickens?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.053
Sir, Jefferson Brick is
a minor character in that novel.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.356
A war correspondent,
if I remember correctly.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.558
So we know the man was trying
to hide his identity.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.294
But why an obscure character
from and obscure novel?

08:49.296 --> 08:52.364
Perhaps he was reading
the book at the time.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.901
By the way, all we really know
is that we don't know
his real name.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.303
Seems we're at a dead end, sirs.
Not necessarily, Crabtree.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.006
We know that he wasn't used
to hard labour

09:01.008 --> 09:03.341
and we know that he didn't
want anyone to know who he was.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.377
Sounds to me
like he was hiding out.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.613
You could be right, sir.
The question is why.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.316
And did whatever
he was hiding from find him?

09:14.954 --> 09:17.022
Hurry it up, Higgins,
or they'll be sold out

09:17.024 --> 09:19.024
before we get there.
We're taking the motorcar.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.526
Yes, but we'll only be as fast
as the wagon we're stuck behind.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.029
Good day, Miss James.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.098
Is that your car
out back?

09:27.100 --> 09:30.035
It is indeed.
Really?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.871
Is that so hard to believe,
Miss James?
Yes.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.973
Well, I suppose you won't be
wanting a ride in it, then.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.942
That depends on where
you're taking me.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.044
As a matter of fact,
we've just found out

09:39.046 --> 09:42.047
about a new ice cream concoction
that is a hit out
in the Beaches.

09:42.049 --> 09:45.016
We're driving out
to give it a try.
It's called a banana split.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.085
Bananas. How exotic.
It's a combination

09:47.087 --> 09:49.054
of ice cream...

09:49.056 --> 09:51.056
-...and cut length-wise
bananas...

09:51.058 --> 09:53.058
-...topped with things
such as pineapples and nuts...

09:53.060 --> 09:55.060
And then they drizzle
the entire thing

09:55.062 --> 09:57.963
in a thick chocolate sauce.
My mouth is watering already.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.098
What are we waiting for?

10:00.100 --> 10:04.069
Now, we have to remember
to get one for Jackson.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.571
He was very keen on the idea
of the banana split.

10:06.573 --> 10:09.341
Well, by the time we get back
it will be a banana soup.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.744
The key ingredient is ice cream.
Would they even let you
take the dish with you?

10:12.746 --> 10:15.013
That's a good point,
Miss James. I wan...

10:15.015 --> 10:17.015
(horrified scream)
Oh my God, Higgins,

10:17.017 --> 10:19.417
you've hit somebody!
It wasn't me!

10:19.419 --> 10:22.420
Oh no!
(woman crying)

10:22.422 --> 10:26.291
You've killed him!
You've killed him!

10:26.293 --> 10:28.426
He's not dead. He's just had
the wind knocked out of him.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.695
Are you alright, son?

10:30.697 --> 10:33.098
Are you hurting somewhere?
No, he's not alright!

10:33.100 --> 10:35.333
Get your hands off my boy!
This wasn't our fault,

10:35.335 --> 10:37.435
you know. He wasn't looking
where he was going.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.105
What's your name, son?
Ewan Gallagher.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.742
Oh, Lord, my poor boy.
Can you walk, son?

10:43.744 --> 10:47.345
Oh! Lord!
I need a doctor.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.481
Ma'am, I'm a trained --
You people keep away from him.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.651
You've done enough harm already.
Higgins, give me your money.
Why?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.653
Just give me
whatever money you have.

10:54.655 --> 10:58.189
We should give her
something for a doctor.
My banana split money.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.162
Ma'am, please accept this

11:04.164 --> 11:06.464
and our apologies.

11:16.242 --> 11:20.078
You could probably make a bob
or two if you sold this thing.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.915
Kept the band
nice and quiet.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.584
I promised that I would send
his things along, sir.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.920
I have to tell you
something, Murdoch.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.089
You're a damn good man.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.625
Not many people would have
given up that child.

11:33.627 --> 11:36.428
He already has a father.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.430
What choice did we have?

11:38.432 --> 11:40.465
Some people would have
made a choice.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.767
Inspector?

11:42.769 --> 11:45.437
Sorry to intrude,
but my name is Edmund Sheppard,

11:45.439 --> 11:48.106
of <i>Saturday Night Magazine.</i>
<i>Whatever it is you're selling,</i>

11:48.108 --> 11:50.141
we're not buying.
No, no, I'm not soliciting.

11:50.143 --> 11:52.110
I'm here to report
a missing person.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.579
One of my writers
has disappeared.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.815
That's him.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.784
Cal Graveman.
What a damnable shame.

11:59.786 --> 12:03.054
How did he come to be
in the House of Industry?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.391
He was on assignment.
To write about the poor house?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.260
To report on conditions.
Treatment of the men.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.396
That kind of thing.
Why not simply go in

12:11.398 --> 12:13.398
as a reporter,
under his own name?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.167
You can't write it
if you haven't lived it.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.169
How did you know that
something had gone wrong?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.171
Cal never missed
a deadline.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.407
He was supposed to be back
this morning, story in hand.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.442
But you didn't hear from him?
No.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.612
Well, he was in communication,
in a sense, up until last night.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.481
How do you mean?

12:29.483 --> 12:32.751
Cal didn't like to carry notes
when he was undercover,

12:32.753 --> 12:34.753
lest they be found.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.755
So he was
sending himself telegrams,

12:36.757 --> 12:39.090
reminders of details
meant just for himself.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.327
In his own sort of code.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.434
I'm afraid it doesn't mean
a thing to me, gentlemen.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.670
You have no idea of
how the code works?
I know some.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.140
It's just Cal's own shorthand,
abbreviations,

12:55.142 --> 12:58.276
dropping vowels and the like.
Nothing systematic.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.545
Well, I'm afraid
without a system,

13:00.547 --> 13:02.614
he would be the only one
who could decipher it.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.784
This here is
the last telegram he sent,

13:05.786 --> 13:07.852
from Tuesday evening.
It's got things in it

13:07.854 --> 13:09.854
that Cal
would use regularly.

13:09.856 --> 13:12.891
W, T, N, S, 2,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.893
B, B, 6, 1...

13:14.895 --> 13:18.296
5, P.
Can't help you on that one.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.167
But this bit here, X, 2, F, P...
Well, X-2 is what he'd use

13:22.169 --> 13:25.804
for "connection to."
He's got a question mark after

13:25.806 --> 13:28.740
so he's wondering...
If something is connected

13:28.742 --> 13:31.409
to F-P.
And we've got an F-P

13:31.411 --> 13:33.912
in the code on his hand as well.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.114
I'm sorry to ask
the obvious question,

13:36.116 --> 13:39.250
Mr. Sheppard, but have you
any idea what "F-P" could mean?

13:39.252 --> 13:41.953
Not a damn clue.

13:47.092 --> 13:49.427
Are you sure
you want to do this?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.430
Mr. Graveman
was investigating something.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.599
I want to put myself
in the same place

13:54.601 --> 13:56.601
and see what he saw.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.603
What he saw
may have got him killed.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.106
I'll endeavour not to meet
the same fate, sir.

14:06.712 --> 14:09.047
Next!

14:09.049 --> 14:12.050
Your name?
Henry Weldon.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.286
Have you been here before?
Never.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.056
Your occupation?
Lumberjack.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.425
Are you willing to work?

14:20.427 --> 14:23.061
Yes, sir.
I want to earn my keep.

14:23.063 --> 14:25.563
I've just fallen on hard times--
No explanation

14:25.565 --> 14:27.632
of your circumstances
is required.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.134
But you will need
to be deloused.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.904
Oh... I haven't got lice.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.906
That's what they all say.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.041
The fumigating room
is up the stairs.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.410
Remove all your clothes
and place them

14:39.412 --> 14:42.146
in the box provided. Next!

14:46.752 --> 14:48.820
Your name?

15:00.099 --> 15:02.867
These your boots?

15:02.869 --> 15:05.203
They're yours if want them.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.372
They belonged to a dead man.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.108
That's his bed
you're getting into.

15:12.044 --> 15:14.979
What happened to him?
Why do you care?

15:14.981 --> 15:18.049
Wouldn't you?

15:18.051 --> 15:21.786
They found him in the bath
with his throat slit.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.823
Where were you
when that happened?

15:25.825 --> 15:28.393
I was sleeping.
I'm a heavy sleeper.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.429
Who was he?

15:31.431 --> 15:35.033
Called himself Jeff Brick
but that wasn't his real name.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.069
How do you know that?
Because he was a greenhorn

15:38.071 --> 15:40.638
pretending he wasn't.
Like you.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.743
I never said
I wasn't new to this.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.079
So what is your story?

15:48.081 --> 15:51.316
I fell on hard times.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.418
Everyone here
fell on hard times.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.321
You married?
I was.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.456
Where's your wife?
She left me.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.359
Kids?
I had a son.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.028
He died?

16:04.030 --> 16:07.532
He has a different
father now.

16:10.035 --> 16:13.705
That's tough.
I'm sorry.

16:13.707 --> 16:17.575
So why would someone want
this Jeff Brick dead?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.545
I dunno. I'm guessing
it was someone

16:20.547 --> 16:22.981
who didn't like
all his questions.

16:45.904 --> 16:48.006
Put them down.

16:48.008 --> 16:51.843
They belonged to a dead man.
They belong to him now.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.148
Next time you pull a knife
on me, you better use it.

17:01.587 --> 17:05.089
I thought you were
a heavy sleeper.

17:05.091 --> 17:08.192
I wasn't sleeping.

17:24.309 --> 17:28.112
Thank you.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.052
So what kind of work
am I in for?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.054
Anything the city needs.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.389
Breaking rocks
for gravel, mainly.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.392
What about
the sawmill?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.461
Who told you
about the sawmill?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.133
There was sawdust
in the laces of those boots.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.073
A man called Riley
has a sawmill in the Don Valley.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.909
He comes to us for extra labour
when he needs it.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.078
I thought we worked
for the city.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.514
What do you care? He pays.
Fifty cents a day.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.517
That's cheap labour
for Mr. Riley.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.921
Who cares?
We get free room and board.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.023
Attention, fellows.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.092
Mr. Riley needs
six strong men today.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.997
That's seven. I said six.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.533
I was a lumberjack.
Any mill work?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.635
I was a sawyer too.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.038
You'll do.
Get in the wagon out front.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.941
What about me?
Next time.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.111
Alright, that's it.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.049
You'd best mind
your place in the queue.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.451
Brick didn't and look
what happened to him.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.764
My face has been
itching me all day.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.400
How often do you sharpen
your razor, Henry?

18:56.402 --> 18:58.402
On the first Sunday
of every month.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.671
You sharpen your razor
once a month?

19:00.673 --> 19:03.007
Dear God, man, that would be
like shaving with a spoon.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.911
I don't...
Henry, look.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.350
Look, it's that boy.
I wouldn't want his luck.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.852
Struck by a motorcar twice
inside of two days?

19:14.854 --> 19:17.522
Oh, Higgins, he hasn't been...
We've been had!

19:17.524 --> 19:20.658
They're queerplungers!

19:20.660 --> 19:23.027
Conniving little bastard.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.030
I'll kill him! Hey!
Hey!

19:26.032 --> 19:28.032
Let's go!

19:28.034 --> 19:31.035
Hey!

19:31.037 --> 19:34.372
We've been made
fools of, George.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.341
It's time for us
to turn the tables.

19:47.019 --> 19:51.656
(indistinct chatter)
(whirring machines)

20:02.868 --> 20:05.136
(whirring machines)

20:08.473 --> 20:11.108
(whistle)
That's rest time.

20:11.110 --> 20:14.612
Ten minutes.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.086
Worked up a sweat yet?

20:22.088 --> 20:25.089
How do they get away
with this?

20:25.091 --> 20:28.593
Using us for private labour.
Everybody gets paid.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.895
Everybody's happy.
'Til someone complains.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.165
Not something
I'd advise you to do.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.505
Who's that?
It's Mrs. Riley.

20:43.442 --> 20:45.443
Looks like your work
is done here today.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.445
What do you mean?

20:47.447 --> 20:50.114
She likes the handsome ones.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.183
And the new men.
Like Brick.

20:52.185 --> 20:56.354
For what?
Odd jobs.

21:01.126 --> 21:04.829
You ever done
any handyman work?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.897
As a matter of fact
I have extensive--

21:06.899 --> 21:09.600
Get in the carriage.

21:18.577 --> 21:21.212
(laughs)

21:25.117 --> 21:28.586
Sir, this just came in
from Station House Five.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.088
Apparently someone reported
seeing a body being buried

21:31.090 --> 21:33.090
in the Don Valley,
just north of Pottery Road.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.092
Why aren't they
following it up?

21:35.094 --> 21:38.095
They say
it's our jurisdiction.
Lazy sods. Talk to the man

21:38.097 --> 21:40.131
who made the report.
Sir, the report was anonymous.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.433
Telephoned in from
the Gerrard Street exchange.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.436
Well, we're not digging up
the entire Don bloody Valley.

21:45.438 --> 21:49.073
Find out if anybody's been
reported missing.
Sir.

21:49.075 --> 21:52.109
You men work so hard.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.445
My husband
can be very demanding.

21:54.447 --> 21:58.115
We appreciate the work, ma'am.
I appreciate the work

21:58.117 --> 22:01.552
that you men do for me.
My husband is never up for it.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.721
Over there.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.123
The doors just...
don't close properly.

22:12.397 --> 22:15.066
Oh! The bottom hinge is loose.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.568
I'll just need a screwdriver.

22:17.570 --> 22:21.072
I'll fetch one
when we're done.

22:21.074 --> 22:24.075
Mrs. Riley...
Please.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.577
Call me Candace.
No, no. Don't.

22:26.579 --> 22:29.580
No one says no to me.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.583
Not if they know
what's good for them.

22:32.585 --> 22:36.087
Candace? Where are you?
Not again.

22:36.089 --> 22:38.589
Again?
Hurry, get in there.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.825
Go, go!
But, I...

22:44.596 --> 22:46.697
(man): What are you doing?

22:46.699 --> 22:50.234
(speaking indistinctly)

22:50.236 --> 22:54.372
O, 3,

22:54.374 --> 22:57.608
40...
2, 19...

22:57.610 --> 22:59.944
<i>F, P...</i>

23:10.789 --> 23:13.891
It's in the study.
What? No! It's okay.

23:13.893 --> 23:17.361
Just stay here and come to bed.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.668
I found it.

23:24.670 --> 23:28.072
Looks like we're gonna be busy
for the next little while.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.142
(sights with relief)

23:33.678 --> 23:36.080
"FP". What does it mean?
I have no idea.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.082
But it clearly meant something
to Mr. Graveman.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.584
Speaking of which,
look at this.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.421
Courtesy of
Station House Five.

23:43.423 --> 23:47.124
A body seen buried
north of Pottery Road

23:47.126 --> 23:50.761
That's close
to the Riley sawmill.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.696
Look at the date and time
the report was made.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.932
7:52 PM.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.768
The night that Mr. Graveman
was killed.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.539
Now look at the telegram
that Graveman sent himself.

24:01.541 --> 24:04.041
7:54 PM.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.711
The telegram and the telephone
call came from the same place.

24:07.713 --> 24:10.381
Mr. Graveman called
Station House Number Five.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.053
W-T-N-S.

24:16.055 --> 24:18.055
Witness to...

24:18.057 --> 24:21.659
body being buried at 6:15 p.m.

24:21.661 --> 24:25.496
North of Pottery Road Bridge.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.666
Police Station Five notified.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.734
Helps when you know
what it's saying

24:30.736 --> 24:33.304
before you translate.
And then of course

24:33.306 --> 24:35.406
"Connection to FP."

24:35.408 --> 24:37.408
This is why
he was murdered, sir.

24:37.410 --> 24:40.644
He saw who buried the body.
What does "chall" mean?

24:40.646 --> 24:43.881
C. Hall?

24:43.883 --> 24:46.083
I imagine there's more
than one C. Hall in the city,

24:46.085 --> 24:48.552
Murdoch. I'll get Crabtree
to check them out.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.588
If we can figure out
who FP is, sir,

24:50.590 --> 24:52.590
we can solve this murder.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.992
I should be getting back.
Be careful.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.761
Graveman had knowledge
that cost him his life.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.331
Now so do you.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.510
(indistinct chatter)

25:32.264 --> 25:36.066
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

25:36.068 --> 25:38.068
What are you doing?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.404
There's a copper in there.
So?

25:40.406 --> 25:43.741
Are you in trouble with them?
Let's just say

25:43.743 --> 25:46.477
I've had bad luck
with them in the past.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.479
(laughs)

25:48.481 --> 25:51.081
What the...

25:51.083 --> 25:54.318
You two hiding
from anyone?

25:54.320 --> 25:57.254
If we are, it's
none of your business.
You should have seen him

25:57.256 --> 25:59.423
Tuesday afternoon.
Copper showed up and he bolted.

25:59.425 --> 26:01.392
Didn't even come back
for his pay.

26:01.394 --> 26:05.029
Same copper inside?
No.

26:05.031 --> 26:07.197
Different one.
I know this guy.

26:07.199 --> 26:09.300
Constable Frank Peakes.

26:09.302 --> 26:12.069
Comes by regular-like.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.039
He's gone.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.608
(laughs)

26:21.413 --> 26:23.547
Sir, I'll tell him
straight away.

26:23.549 --> 26:26.717
Inspector!
That was the Detective.

26:26.719 --> 26:29.053
He wants you to meet him
at Riley's sawmill.

26:29.055 --> 26:31.088
Right.
Also, sir.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.223
I did some looking into it.
There are eight people

26:33.225 --> 26:35.759
in Toronto with the last name
Hall and a first initial C.

26:35.761 --> 26:39.830
But I was also thinking
C Hall could mean City Hall.

26:39.832 --> 26:42.766
City Hall.
Never thought of that.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.869
But why use the full name Hall
and not City?

26:45.871 --> 26:48.205
I don't know.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.017
Sir.
What do you know?

27:00.019 --> 27:03.687
Sir, we just had a visit
from a Constable Frank Peakes

27:03.689 --> 27:06.023
of Station House
Number Five.

27:06.025 --> 27:09.026
FP, sir.
Ah, and you think --

27:09.028 --> 27:11.028
It occurs to me
that using workhouse men

27:11.030 --> 27:13.897
for personal advantage may not
have escaped the attention
of the police.

27:13.899 --> 27:16.700
And you think that
Frank Peakes is taking money

27:16.702 --> 27:18.736
to look the other way?
It's possible.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.572
Even if he is,
what's the connection
to the Graveman murder?

27:21.574 --> 27:25.042
I don't know. And I don't
think Mr. Graveman knew either.

27:25.044 --> 27:29.046
He wrote "connection to F-P"
with a question mark,

27:29.048 --> 27:31.315
implying that he was
merely speculating.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.319
And we're only assuming FP
is in fact Frank Peakes.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.355
That's true.
I'll have a word with him.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.357
Get his measure.
Thank you, sir.

27:40.359 --> 27:43.394
And also, please have George
look into John Dempsey.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.396
Any outstanding warrants.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.498
He seems unduly wary
of the police.

27:54.673 --> 27:58.075
(Crabtree): There he is.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.644
Ewan Gallagher.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.924
(cries with pain)

28:17.128 --> 28:19.363
(woman sobbing)
You've killed him!

28:19.365 --> 28:21.665
You've killed him!

28:21.667 --> 28:25.602
Are you alright, son?
He needs a doctor!

28:25.604 --> 28:28.772
How will I ever
afford a doctor?

28:30.241 --> 28:32.242
My poor boy!

28:32.244 --> 28:35.412
Thank you.
Now!

28:35.414 --> 28:39.049
Now, now, now, now!
Hey! Hey, stop!

28:39.051 --> 28:41.952
Unhand me!

28:43.888 --> 28:47.925
I know you...
I've got you now,
you little guttersnipe.

28:47.927 --> 28:52.062
Be still.
Please sir, let go.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.231
I'm hurt.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.400
That won't work on me
this time, Ewan.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.736
No, sir,

28:58.738 --> 29:01.405
I'm terribly hurt.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.440
I must see a doctor
straightaway.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.510
You know, if you
keep these shenanigans up,
you really will hurt yourself,

29:06.512 --> 29:09.379
you'll injure yourself badly.
I know you're right

29:09.381 --> 29:12.983
because that's what's happened!
Really?

29:12.985 --> 29:16.186
Well, no wonder,
doing something so foolish.

29:16.188 --> 29:19.123
Alright, let's get you off
to a hospital.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.158
You're the nicest policeman
I ever met.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.026
I'm not being nice.
I'm a good judge of character.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.028
(cries with pain)

29:25.030 --> 29:27.030
Hey, get back here!

29:27.032 --> 29:29.166
You won't get very far away!
We've got your mother!

29:29.168 --> 29:31.034
She's not my mother!

29:31.036 --> 29:34.104
What?
(grunts with pain)

29:37.442 --> 29:40.377
(knocks on door)
Inspector.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.046
Constable Frank Peakes.
I was told you wanted

29:43.048 --> 29:45.115
to speak with me.
Come in.

29:45.117 --> 29:49.052
I've heard that you
dropped by Riley's Sawmill

29:49.054 --> 29:51.221
up by Pottery Road today.
That's right.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.390
And you were a there a couple
of weeks ago, as well.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.393
What of it?
Did you notice

29:56.395 --> 29:58.562
that Riley's been using
House of Industry men

29:58.564 --> 30:00.697
at the mill?
Why would I?

30:00.699 --> 30:04.568
Using City workers
for personal gain is illegal.

30:04.570 --> 30:07.571
I'm sure that Riley
would pay to keep that quiet.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.507
Are you implying
I'm on the take, sir?

30:10.509 --> 30:13.577
You seem to be
going there pretty often.
I was there two weeks ago

30:13.579 --> 30:15.913
to check on code violations.
I went there today

30:15.915 --> 30:17.915
to look for my beat partner.
He's been missing

30:17.917 --> 30:20.918
for 3 days now.
And you thought
you'd find him at a sawmill?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.920
It was on his beat.
And three nights ago

30:22.922 --> 30:25.856
we received an anonymous report
of a body being buried
in the vicinity.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.858
What was the name
of your partner?

30:27.860 --> 30:30.627
Robert Hall.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.963
Constable Hall.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.438
Crabtree!
Sir.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.607
Where have you been?
Sir, the boy got away,

30:43.609 --> 30:45.609
but Higgins is putting
the mother in the cells now.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.445
What are you talking about?
The boy from when
Higgins and I

30:48.447 --> 30:50.581
were queerplunged on our way
to get our banana splits!

30:50.583 --> 30:52.950
Queer--
Sir, queerplunged.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.953
Tricked, conned, scammed.
Sir... Queerplunged.

30:55.955 --> 30:59.556
You're probably wondering
about John Dempsey, sir.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.559
I am.
Station Five issued
an arrest warrant for him

31:02.561 --> 31:04.561
three weeks ago.
What for?

31:04.563 --> 31:07.130
For beating up
one of their coppers.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.078
Did you speak
to Constable Peakes?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.580
Bugger Peakes.
He was at the sawmill

31:23.582 --> 31:26.416
looking for his partner,
Constable Hall.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.585
C-Hall.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.621
Apparently the mill
was on his beat.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.923
He's been missing
since Tuesday.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.259
You should have seen him
Tuesday afternoon.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.594
Copper showed up and he bolted.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.430
Didn't even come back
for his pay.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.100
Dempsey wasn't seen
around the mill

31:43.102 --> 31:45.135
after Constable
Hall's visit.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.271
Do you wanna deal
with him now?

31:47.273 --> 31:49.840
No, no.
In the morning.

32:16.401 --> 32:18.535
You're a copper?

32:18.537 --> 32:20.671
A bloody copper!

32:26.377 --> 32:28.712
(both grunting)

32:45.363 --> 32:48.465
Don't move.
John Dempsey,

32:48.467 --> 32:51.134
you're under arrest
for the murder of Cal Graveman.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.671
Who?
Jefferson Brick.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.342
I never killed Brick.
Why would I kill Brick?

32:58.344 --> 33:01.511
Because he witnessed you
burying the body of
Constable Hall.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.481
What?
He saw you, Mr. Dempsey.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.217
He gave a full account
to Station House Number Five.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.519
Brick was no witness.

33:09.521 --> 33:12.322
I was the witness.
You?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.391
I called the police.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.060
I told them I saw
a body being buried.

33:17.062 --> 33:19.529
Then why did you attack me?

33:19.531 --> 33:21.565
And why did you run
this afternoon?

33:21.567 --> 33:23.934
I thought you were here
to kill me.

33:23.936 --> 33:26.069
Why would I kill you?

33:26.071 --> 33:28.905
The copper who came by today?

33:28.907 --> 33:31.441
He was the one I saw

33:31.443 --> 33:33.844
burying that body.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.087
That's far enough.
I'm telling you.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.089
I swear, I'm the witness.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.892
You saw a policeman
burying a body?

33:48.894 --> 33:51.094
I didn't know he was a copper
until he came by

33:51.096 --> 33:54.031
earlier today.
Hey! Hey! You!

33:54.033 --> 33:56.767
Get out.
You leave the premises,

33:56.769 --> 33:58.769
or I'm calling the police.
I am the police.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.805
I'm Detective William Murdoch
of the Toronto Constabulary.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.375
I'm acting under orders
of Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.712
I need you
to telephone Mr. Brackenreid

34:08.714 --> 34:11.381
at Station House Number Four
and have him meet me

34:11.383 --> 34:15.218
at the Riley sawmill.
And you, get up.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.254
What?
You're coming with me

34:17.256 --> 34:20.123
and you're going to show me
where that body is buried.

34:27.398 --> 34:29.399
I thought you said

34:29.401 --> 34:31.435
it was in a shallow grave.
It was.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.071
Are you sure
this is the right spot?

34:34.073 --> 34:37.074
Yeah. I'm sure.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.643
I'm telling you the truth.
You have to believe me.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.092
I believe you.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.094
Peakes must have come back

34:57.096 --> 34:59.429
and moved the body.
He had to.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.032
He knew he'd been witnessed
burying the body.

35:02.034 --> 35:04.034
So he knew that

35:04.036 --> 35:06.169
if it had been found,
it would be examined

35:06.171 --> 35:08.205
for evidence.
Right.

35:08.207 --> 35:12.109
Question is:
Where did he move it to?

35:30.895 --> 35:33.663
There.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.900
Traces of blood.
They sawed up his body?

35:36.902 --> 35:39.903
Why not just move the body
somewhere else?

35:39.905 --> 35:43.240
Because once we had discovered
that the victim

35:43.242 --> 35:45.408
was a police constable,
we would have dug up

35:45.410 --> 35:47.410
the entire valley
looking for the body.

35:47.412 --> 35:50.080
A body is still a body whether
or not it's in pieces.

35:50.082 --> 35:52.649
That depends on how small
the pieces are.

35:54.785 --> 35:58.421
Where's the wood chipper?
In the basement.

35:58.423 --> 36:01.458
Let's have a look.

36:04.028 --> 36:07.430
You'll get your chance
to see the chipper, Detective.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.535
Just not the way
you intended.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.570
Constable Peakes.

36:13.572 --> 36:17.374
So you're the fellow who
reported a body being buried.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.543
All this time
we thought it was Brick.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.946
Is that why you killed him?
I didn't kill nobody.

36:22.948 --> 36:26.716
I killed Brick.
Wardell just pointed him out.

36:26.718 --> 36:29.452
You should have minded
your own business, Dempsey.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.955
What about
Constable Hall?

36:31.957 --> 36:34.057
He stuck his nose in
where it didn't belong.

36:34.059 --> 36:36.426
Much like the two of you.

36:36.428 --> 36:40.063
Well... Thank you gentlemen
for your confession.

36:40.065 --> 36:42.098
You're both under arrest.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.401
(laughs)

36:44.403 --> 36:46.903
In case you haven't noticed,
Detective Murdoch,

36:46.905 --> 36:50.440
we're the ones holding the axes.

37:14.765 --> 37:17.100
Dempsey!

37:29.480 --> 37:31.915
(saw whirring)

37:38.956 --> 37:41.891
Look out!

37:48.499 --> 37:52.302
Everybody stop!
(gunshot)

37:52.304 --> 37:55.639
Aaaaaah!

37:55.641 --> 37:58.942
(saw whirring)

37:58.944 --> 38:01.511
(heavy breathing)

38:01.513 --> 38:04.014
Bloody hell.

38:04.016 --> 38:07.550
Was that Frank Peakes?
It was.

38:07.552 --> 38:10.020
Who's he?

38:10.022 --> 38:13.056
Sir, this is John Dempsey.
He's with us.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.358
And that is Mr. Wardell,

38:15.360 --> 38:19.229
Constable Peakes' accomplice.
Well, Mr. Wardell.

38:19.231 --> 38:22.565
Consider yourself lucky
you're only under arrest.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.040
You saved my life,
Mr. Dempsey.

38:30.042 --> 38:33.043
I'm sorry that I ever doubted
your character.

38:33.045 --> 38:36.046
Thank you very much,
Mr. Weldon...

38:36.048 --> 38:39.215
Detective.
(laughs)

38:39.217 --> 38:43.053
Though I gather you did
assault a police constable

38:43.055 --> 38:46.056
some weeks back.
That copper was roughing up

38:46.058 --> 38:48.058
a shopkeeper
for no good reason.

38:48.060 --> 38:51.394
I stepped in.
You hit him?

38:51.396 --> 38:53.530
Only after he hit me.

38:53.532 --> 38:57.367
Where will you go next?

38:57.369 --> 39:00.904
Maybe up North.
Got a cousin up by Lake Simcoe.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.940
Maybe I'll head back
to the House of Industry.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.009
Maybe...

39:06.011 --> 39:08.478
I'll get invited inside
by Mrs. Riley.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.516
If you are looking
for permanent employment,

39:13.518 --> 39:15.518
I could see to it that
you're accepted into training.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.421
As...?
As a police constable.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.026
You have great instincts.
And you were willing

39:23.028 --> 39:26.663
to put yourself at risk
to report that murder.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.302
I don't know
that I belong here.

39:34.238 --> 39:36.272
At any rate,
I thank you for your aid.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.274
And if you are ever

39:38.276 --> 39:41.611
in need of a favour,
my door is always open.

39:50.287 --> 39:53.423
Constable Francis Peakes.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.558
Such a shame.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.594
I always thought
he showed such promise.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.763
According to Riley's files,

39:59.765 --> 40:02.065
Peakes had been taking money
for years.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.068
I imagine you'll be paying
Station House Five a visit.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.070
I already have.
I can assure you

40:07.072 --> 40:09.606
his colleagues
know nothing of his actions.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.742
Except the one he killed.
Constable Robert Hall.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.445
Young man,
only on the force a year.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.015
Their Inspector believes Hall
learned of Peakes' corruption

40:19.017 --> 40:22.952
and was going to turn him in.
So only Peakes was involved?

40:22.954 --> 40:25.088
The constables at Station Five
are good men.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.290
I groomed many of them myself.

40:27.292 --> 40:29.993
You've heard the saying
"one bad apple", surely.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.429
I wouldn't put too much stock

40:32.431 --> 40:34.464
in a tired old adage like that.

40:34.466 --> 40:36.599
How much stock
would you put in the adage

40:36.601 --> 40:39.636
"a fish rots from the head?"

40:39.638 --> 40:42.038
What are you implying?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.107
I'm not implying anything,
Chief Constable.

40:44.109 --> 40:47.944
I'm telling you straight out:
if there is rot, it stinks.

40:47.946 --> 40:51.080
And I've got a damned
good nose for it.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.718
Perhaps you're
a little overworked, Tom

40:55.720 --> 40:58.721
Good day, gentlemen.

41:05.362 --> 41:07.397
Sir,

41:07.399 --> 41:09.566
that was dangerously close
to insubordination.

41:09.568 --> 41:13.403
Station House Five
was his station, Murdoch.

41:13.405 --> 41:15.371
Are you telling me

41:15.373 --> 41:17.340
he didn't know anything
about this?

41:17.342 --> 41:19.576
I'm sure your suspicions
are accurate.

41:19.578 --> 41:22.078
The question is

41:22.080 --> 41:24.681
what are you going
to do about it?

41:24.683 --> 41:27.083
I don't know.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.486
But I'm going to do something.

41:38.696 --> 41:40.763
I can't believe
you let him go.

41:40.765 --> 41:42.765
I thought the boy
to be truly hurt, Henry.

41:42.767 --> 41:44.767
All he does is pretend
to be hurt, George.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.769
It's his profession.
Well he's awfully convincing.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.771
I think it's
to Constables Crabtree's credit

41:48.773 --> 41:50.773
that he gave the boy
the benefit of the doubt.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.775
If we gave every criminal
the benefit of the doubt

41:52.777 --> 41:56.112
we'd never arrest anyone.
I am not disagreeing
with you there, Henry.

41:56.114 --> 41:58.781
The boy is a menace.
He should be locked up.

41:58.783 --> 42:01.217
I'm still limping.
At least you caught the woman.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.386
That's a good point,
Miss James.

42:03.388 --> 42:06.556
Would you look at that!

42:06.558 --> 42:09.058
We're about to enjoy
our first banana split.

42:09.060 --> 42:11.361
All is good, Henry.

42:13.397 --> 42:15.465
Oh, for pete's sake!

42:15.467 --> 42:17.467
If we'd only
gotten here earlier.

42:17.469 --> 42:19.435
Maybe if
you hadn't been limping.

42:19.437 --> 42:22.272
Oh my God, it's him!

42:22.274 --> 42:24.374
It's that little
scallywag! You!

42:24.376 --> 42:28.311
Come back here!
Ow, ow! Get back here!

42:28.313 --> 42:32.081
Get... Henry!
What are you doing?

42:32.083 --> 42:36.052
Go! Go! Come on!
Ow!

42:40.424 --> 42:44.127
Julia! When did you get home?
Minutes ago.

42:44.129 --> 42:46.629
That conference
was such a whirlwind.

42:46.631 --> 42:48.765
How did you get on
with your case?

42:48.767 --> 42:51.100
It turned into quite
an adventure, actually.

42:51.102 --> 42:54.170
I'm quite exhausted.
I'm so glad to be home.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.608
Oh...

42:58.610 --> 43:00.743
It's still here?

43:00.745 --> 43:03.580
I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.715
I'll take it out first thing
in the morning, I promise.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.951
Should we go
and see his father?

43:07.953 --> 43:10.386
Yes. Yes, we should.

43:10.388 --> 43:13.756
But... maybe not yet.

43:13.758 --> 43:16.092
If that's all right?

43:18.062 --> 43:20.630
Of course.

43:23.067 --> 43:25.635
I'll check the mail.
