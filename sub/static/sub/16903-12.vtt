00:01.931 --> 00:03.332
I never thought this
day would come, lizzie.

00:03.333 --> 00:05.500
Okay, push.

00:05.568 --> 00:08.135
Push, liz lemon!

00:08.204 --> 00:10.005
Here comes your baby!

00:10.006 --> 00:12.507
Congratulations.
It's meat cat!

00:12.575 --> 00:14.576
the cheesy blasters mascot.

00:14.644 --> 00:16.612
I'm what's inside ya!

00:16.679 --> 00:18.513
Razzmatazz!

00:21.117 --> 00:23.585
I got to eat better.

00:26.723 --> 00:28.624
Oh, hello, mr. Hornberger.

00:28.691 --> 00:30.425
I thought I was the only
one here at this hour.

00:30.426 --> 00:31.994
No, this is just
my little ritual,

00:31.995 --> 00:33.829
So I can have a moment
of peace and quiet

00:33.830 --> 00:36.465
Between home,
where this happened,

00:36.532 --> 00:38.267
And work, where...

00:38.268 --> 00:40.602
I'm always being interrupted.

00:40.637 --> 00:41.637
Oh, I get it.

00:41.638 --> 00:42.771
A little pete time.

00:42.772 --> 00:43.905
Pardon the familiarity.

00:43.906 --> 00:47.042
Well, you just enjoy
your coffee, sir,

00:47.110 --> 00:48.710
While I tell you a funny story

00:48.711 --> 00:50.178
About my friend's cat.

00:50.179 --> 00:52.214
His name is mr. Wiggles,

00:52.282 --> 00:54.149
And his cat's name is benson.

00:54.150 --> 00:55.150
Where's liz?

00:55.151 --> 00:56.852
I need to speak
to her right away.

00:56.853 --> 00:58.754
I guess that's the end
of pete and kenneth time.

01:01.624 --> 01:03.925
Liz, she's here.

01:03.993 --> 01:05.027
Verna's here.

01:05.028 --> 01:06.928
My mother is downstairs.

01:06.963 --> 01:08.863
Are you sure?

01:08.865 --> 01:10.532
I didn't see her.
Security called.

01:10.533 --> 01:11.700
She was trying to use

01:11.701 --> 01:13.702
An oxycontin prescription
bottle as I.D.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.037
That's verna.

01:15.038 --> 01:16.138
Oh!

01:16.139 --> 01:17.773
So is she coming up?

01:17.774 --> 01:18.940
Are you kidding?

01:18.941 --> 01:20.475
I told them to throw
her off the property.

01:20.476 --> 01:21.810
But I'm sure she's down there,

01:21.811 --> 01:23.711
Sitting on a curb,
chain-smoking,

01:23.713 --> 01:25.347
And waiting for
me to come out.

01:25.348 --> 01:27.449
Just like the day I was born.

01:27.517 --> 01:28.717
Wow.

01:28.718 --> 01:30.485
Look, jenna, I know
that she's no prize,

01:30.486 --> 01:32.587
But no matter what,
verna is your mother.

01:32.655 --> 01:34.790
Don't you want to have a
relationship with your mother?

01:34.857 --> 01:36.058
This isn't a relationship.

01:36.059 --> 01:37.426
This is some
woman who shows up

01:37.427 --> 01:38.960
Every couple of years
to ask for money.

01:38.961 --> 01:40.696
To her, I'm just a gorgeous,

01:40.697 --> 01:42.597
Naturally-blonde atm.

01:42.632 --> 01:44.599
You know, my mother and I
sometimes didn't see eye to eye,

01:44.667 --> 01:46.535
But at the end of the
day, we always said

01:46.536 --> 01:48.103
don't go to sleep

01:48.104 --> 01:50.472
with a frown in your pocket

01:50.540 --> 01:53.108
Ugh, liz, you don't know
anything about mothers.

01:53.176 --> 01:55.777
Where's jack?

01:55.845 --> 01:58.480
go into your yard
and tie it on a rocket

01:58.548 --> 02:00.148
Both: shoot it to the moon

02:00.149 --> 02:02.284
you'll be feeling better soon

02:02.352 --> 02:04.920
don't go to bed with a frown

02:25.541 --> 02:28.009
Yeah, there were firemen
there and everything.

02:28.077 --> 02:29.811
Where?
- At my house.

02:29.812 --> 02:31.079
I left my sith lord cloak

02:31.080 --> 02:33.181
Too near my mom's
shrine to italian jesus,

02:33.249 --> 02:34.716
And the candles
started a fire.

02:34.717 --> 02:36.251
Were the firemen strong?

02:36.252 --> 02:38.152
Were any of them the
ones from the calendar?

02:38.154 --> 02:40.054
My mom's staying
with family upstate,

02:40.056 --> 02:42.190
But I've got to find
someplace around here to crash.

02:42.258 --> 02:43.692
I'm sorry.

02:43.693 --> 02:45.360
Would you like to
stay in my guest house?

02:45.361 --> 02:46.361
Yeah. Thanks.

02:46.362 --> 02:47.729
When's good to go over there?

02:47.730 --> 02:48.730
Oh, I'm not offering.

02:48.731 --> 02:49.998
I'm just taking a survey

02:49.999 --> 02:51.967
To gauge general interest.

02:52.034 --> 02:53.902
But liz here has
a spare apartment.

02:53.903 --> 02:55.303
Ain't that right, liz?

02:55.304 --> 02:56.538
Well, it's not really spare.

02:56.539 --> 02:57.939
I bought the place
upstairs from me

02:57.940 --> 02:59.374
When I thought I was
getting a talk show.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.842
But I'm gonna finish
the combination

03:00.843 --> 03:02.344
As soon as I either
hit the lottery

03:02.345 --> 03:05.247
Or get married.

03:05.314 --> 03:07.315
Ugh. Fine. You
can stay with me.

03:07.383 --> 03:08.884
But it's stuff like this

03:08.885 --> 03:10.585
That makes me eat
things like this.

03:10.586 --> 03:11.987
Thanks, liz.

03:11.988 --> 03:13.822
Oh, I'd like to pre-apologize

03:13.823 --> 03:16.091
For clogging your
tub, sink, and toilet.

03:19.595 --> 03:20.929
Mothers.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.898
You can't kill them...

03:25.668 --> 03:27.869
Verna's been using me
my whole life, jack.

03:27.937 --> 03:30.605
I never saw a penny from any
of the commercials I booked.

03:30.673 --> 03:32.507
Keep you and your pets safe

03:32.508 --> 03:34.509
With gator hater gator spray.

03:34.577 --> 03:36.912
Sorry. Honey, you got to
get closer to the gator.

03:36.979 --> 03:38.680
We drove eleven
hours to get here,

03:38.681 --> 03:40.182
And you're not
getting any younger.

03:40.183 --> 03:41.883
But when I wanted
to sing a duet

03:41.884 --> 03:43.218
In a mother-daughter pageant,

03:43.219 --> 03:45.454
She blew it off because
there was no prize money.

03:45.521 --> 03:46.822
But today's different, jenna.

03:46.823 --> 03:47.856
Today you break the cycle,

03:47.857 --> 03:51.393
Because today you
are going to say...

03:53.129 --> 03:55.430
I developed this
presentation in 2002

03:55.498 --> 03:56.498
When colleen attempted

03:56.499 --> 03:57.599
To lengthen her
christmas visit

03:57.600 --> 03:58.600
To martin luther king day,

03:58.601 --> 03:59.601
Or as she calls it,

03:59.602 --> 04:00.769
"that day in January

04:00.770 --> 04:02.170
When the post
office is closed."

04:02.171 --> 04:03.505
I had to draw the line.

04:03.506 --> 04:05.407
I had to say...

04:07.543 --> 04:08.944
This word is your best friend.

04:08.945 --> 04:10.212
Best friend with benefits?

04:10.213 --> 04:11.780
Step one, say no.

04:11.781 --> 04:12.981
Step two...

04:12.982 --> 04:14.816
She will try to pick
a fight with you.

04:14.817 --> 04:15.817
You will not let her.

04:15.818 --> 04:17.219
She will raise her voice.

04:17.220 --> 04:21.223
<i>But I'm going to ask you to...</i>

04:21.290 --> 04:23.391
Always speak quieter.

04:23.459 --> 04:25.527
Can I just tell you I'm
genuinely having fun right now?

04:25.595 --> 04:26.862
If you raise your voice,

04:26.863 --> 04:27.863
Emotions take over,

04:27.864 --> 04:29.564
And she gets the upper hand.

04:29.565 --> 04:31.299
But if you're calm and quiet,

04:31.300 --> 04:32.434
You stay in control,

04:32.435 --> 04:33.702
And it's on to step three.

04:33.703 --> 04:35.504
And this is the
hardest one of all.

04:35.505 --> 04:37.706
She will tell you how
disappointed she is in you,

04:37.773 --> 04:39.274
And she will get up to leave,

04:39.275 --> 04:42.511
And you...

04:42.578 --> 04:44.346
Let her walk away.

04:44.347 --> 04:45.347
It's simple.

04:45.348 --> 04:47.983
Say no. Talk low.

04:48.050 --> 04:51.119
Let her go.

04:51.187 --> 04:54.055
Frank. Frank?

04:54.123 --> 04:57.759
Do you smell smoke?

04:57.827 --> 04:58.827
What the hell, frank?

04:58.828 --> 05:00.896
Oh, man. Look, liz

05:00.963 --> 05:03.565
How can you smoke?
It's disgusting.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.333
And in my apartment?

05:05.334 --> 05:06.935
Wow. An old white
lady yelling at me

05:06.936 --> 05:08.537
While wearing
microwavable socks.

05:08.538 --> 05:10.572
This is so different
than living with my mom.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.074
Okay, so I smoke a little
as a stress release.

05:13.142 --> 05:15.042
I never told you, 'cause
I knew you'd lecture me.

05:15.044 --> 05:16.177
It is not a lecture

05:16.178 --> 05:18.079
To simply point out to someone

05:18.147 --> 05:20.115
<i>That the episode
of diff'rent strokes</i>

05:20.182 --> 05:21.316
About dudley's dad

05:21.317 --> 05:23.118
Has proven incontrovertibly

05:23.119 --> 05:24.619
That smoking
destroys your health

05:24.620 --> 05:26.254
And leads to
ridicule from willis.

05:26.255 --> 05:27.255
Well, what about you?

05:27.256 --> 05:28.390
You can't judge me

05:28.391 --> 05:29.724
When you're eating
that garbage.

05:29.725 --> 05:31.426
This is not the same
thing at all, frank.

05:31.427 --> 05:34.029
Dr. Oz did a show
about junk food.

05:34.096 --> 05:36.598
I saw it, 'cause it's on
a compilation dvd I have

05:36.666 --> 05:37.832
Of fat ladies crying.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.935
And this stuff will kill ya.

05:40.002 --> 05:45.740
"manufactured in a facility
that also processes food."

05:45.808 --> 05:47.708
This is what
meat cat spoke of.

05:47.743 --> 05:49.210
So I guess I'll just get

05:49.211 --> 05:50.712
One of those little
throat radios,

05:50.713 --> 05:52.180
And you'll be buried
in a piano crate.

05:52.181 --> 05:53.348
Goodnight, liz.

05:53.349 --> 05:55.517
No, frank, that fire
in your apartment

05:55.585 --> 05:56.718
Was no accident.

05:56.719 --> 05:59.321
I know. I just wanted
to be in control!

05:59.388 --> 06:00.388
It was fate!

06:00.389 --> 06:01.590
We've been brought together

06:01.591 --> 06:05.460
To help each other
stop being gross.

06:05.528 --> 06:06.695
What do you say?

06:06.696 --> 06:07.862
All right.

06:07.863 --> 06:10.065
But if doing this
restores my sex drive,

06:10.132 --> 06:11.733
The plus-sized ladies
in the mail room

06:11.734 --> 06:13.969
Have you to blame.

06:15.905 --> 06:18.406
Oh, there's my baby girl!

06:18.474 --> 06:20.508
Hello, verna.

06:20.576 --> 06:23.144
No. Low. Go.

06:23.212 --> 06:24.579
Okay. I know.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.780
Every time we see each other,

06:25.781 --> 06:27.382
I'm always hitting
you up for money.

06:27.383 --> 06:30.085
And I know that it's
always for something stupid,

06:30.152 --> 06:31.853
Like paying the medical bills

06:31.854 --> 06:33.054
That time that my boyfriend

06:33.055 --> 06:35.190
Broke his tailbone
off in that cage match.

06:35.257 --> 06:38.326
But this time it's different.

06:38.394 --> 06:40.495
I said no.

06:40.563 --> 06:41.830
Wait, what is this?

06:41.831 --> 06:43.798
I'm trying to pay you back.

06:43.866 --> 06:46.001
I'm trying to
make good for once.

06:46.068 --> 06:47.402
Is this the fight?

06:47.403 --> 06:49.504
I'm talking quieter.

06:49.572 --> 06:50.572
I'm in control.

06:50.573 --> 06:52.007
What's that now?

06:52.008 --> 06:53.408
I'm the calm one.

06:53.409 --> 06:54.609
Upper hand.

06:54.610 --> 06:56.778
Jenna, why are we
talking like this?

06:56.846 --> 06:58.246
Does somebody have a gun?

06:58.247 --> 07:00.215
I'm going lower now.

07:00.282 --> 07:02.083
Okay.

07:02.084 --> 07:05.620
Well, I know you're busy.

07:05.688 --> 07:08.223
I just wanted to say
this face to face.

07:08.290 --> 07:10.992
I am so proud of you.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.795
And I love you so much.

07:13.863 --> 07:16.197
And I wish I'd said that more.

07:19.935 --> 07:21.469
Don't go, mommy.

07:21.470 --> 07:24.506
I'll stand closer
to the gator.

07:32.873 --> 07:34.173
Goon!

07:34.174 --> 07:37.643
Sorry I'm late,
mr. Hornberger.

07:37.711 --> 07:39.478
funny story.

07:39.479 --> 07:40.980
There was a guy on the subway

07:40.981 --> 07:43.582
Who I thought for a second
didn't have any fingers.

07:43.650 --> 07:45.050
But then I realized

07:45.051 --> 07:48.320
He was holding
his hand like this.

07:48.388 --> 07:49.755
Listen up, everyone.

07:49.756 --> 07:52.458
Frank and I have some
exciting news to share.

07:52.526 --> 07:54.960
I am quitting smoking.

07:55.028 --> 07:56.595
And I am gonna start
eating healthier.

07:56.596 --> 07:58.831
I signed up for a
service called "noofud"

07:58.899 --> 08:01.500
That delivers
humanely-portioned organic meals.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.468
And I took the elevator
all the way up here

08:03.503 --> 08:05.237
Without losing my breath.

08:09.442 --> 08:11.810
Liz, god knows you
should eat better,

08:11.878 --> 08:13.078
But maybe now's not the time.

08:13.079 --> 08:14.813
It's show week,

08:14.814 --> 08:16.148
And I can't have
you melting down,

08:16.149 --> 08:18.049
And junk food is
your stress release.

08:18.051 --> 08:19.552
We all need a release.

08:19.553 --> 08:21.887
I know, because kenneth
has taken mine away from me,

08:21.955 --> 08:24.056
And I'm worried about what
I'm gonna do to replace it.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.291
While you were talking,

08:25.292 --> 08:27.660
I put a thumbtack in my neck.

08:28.862 --> 08:29.962
Makes me feel something.

08:29.963 --> 08:31.564
Well, don't worry
about me, pete.

08:31.565 --> 08:32.565
I have a new outlet-

08:32.566 --> 08:34.133
My delicious noofud.

08:34.134 --> 08:35.734
Like my upcoming lunch,

08:35.735 --> 08:37.703
Autumn tempeh risotto

08:37.770 --> 08:41.340
With salmon-rubbed
streusel chunks.

08:41.408 --> 08:43.308
Oh!

08:47.047 --> 08:48.047
Jenna?

08:48.048 --> 08:49.415
I just wanted to see

08:49.416 --> 08:50.749
How it went with
verna last night.

08:50.750 --> 08:52.284
Jack, it was perfect.

08:52.285 --> 08:53.819
Like a john mayer song.

08:53.820 --> 08:55.321
Good. So you said no?

08:55.322 --> 08:57.089
I didn't have to. She
didn't want anything.

08:57.090 --> 08:58.424
She's completely changed.

08:58.425 --> 08:59.892
What? No.

08:59.893 --> 09:01.327
People do not change.

09:01.328 --> 09:02.528
In the late '90s,

09:02.529 --> 09:04.196
I thought colleen had
become a better person.

09:04.197 --> 09:05.397
It turns out she had a tumor

09:05.398 --> 09:08.234
Pressing on her
brain's pleasure center.

09:08.301 --> 09:10.402
A tumor those quack
doctors removed.

09:10.470 --> 09:12.271
Jack, this is different.

09:12.272 --> 09:13.472
<i>She gave me money.</i>

09:13.473 --> 09:15.241
It's not different, jenna.

09:15.242 --> 09:17.176
It never is.

09:17.244 --> 09:19.211
You must be verna.

09:19.279 --> 09:21.547
Oh, and you must
be jack donaghy.

09:21.615 --> 09:23.515
Jenna, you were
right, darlin'.

09:23.583 --> 09:25.217
He does look
like he'd be great

09:25.218 --> 09:29.188
Between those two things
we were talking about.

09:29.256 --> 09:30.289
Interesting earrings.

09:30.290 --> 09:33.058
Oh, thank you. I
made 'em myself.

09:33.126 --> 09:35.527
Something's killing all the
birds in my neighborhood.

09:35.595 --> 09:37.830
Mom, I really wish you
didn't have to leave tonight.

09:37.897 --> 09:40.332
'cause my birthday's
this weekend.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.901
Oh, my god. I am
the worst mother.

09:42.969 --> 09:44.103
No.
- Yes, I am.

09:44.104 --> 09:45.537
Don't say that.

09:45.538 --> 09:47.006
Could a bad mom have
raised a daughter

09:47.007 --> 09:48.941
Who was engaged to a
congressman when she was 16?

09:49.009 --> 09:50.342
Jenna to the stage, please.

09:50.343 --> 09:51.343
Oh, that's me.

09:51.344 --> 09:53.846
Oh, goodness.

09:53.913 --> 09:56.849
Oh.

09:56.916 --> 09:58.450
Blowing town tonight, huh?

09:58.451 --> 10:00.619
I knew it was her birthday.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.388
I'm throwing her
a surprise party,

10:02.389 --> 10:04.823
And it's at a
fancy restaurant,

10:04.891 --> 10:06.692
So wear something nice.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.593
Like a pair of white jeans

10:08.628 --> 10:11.130
And a dan marino jersey
or something, 'kay?

10:16.836 --> 10:18.404
Hey. So how you holding up?

10:18.405 --> 10:20.305
Terrible. I have a
headache, a stomachache.

10:20.307 --> 10:21.573
Last night I spent an hour

10:21.574 --> 10:23.509
Trying to remember how to
spell the word "heighth."

10:23.576 --> 10:25.244
Liz, your body is crying out

10:25.245 --> 10:26.912
For all the chemicals
it's used to.

10:26.913 --> 10:28.681
You can't go on like this.

10:28.682 --> 10:30.015
Here. Eat it.

10:30.016 --> 10:31.550
Eat it. Come on.
You need your crutch.

10:31.551 --> 10:32.551
Stop it!

10:32.552 --> 10:36.722
God, your arms
are really weak.

10:36.790 --> 10:37.823
What are you smiling at?

10:37.824 --> 10:39.224
Aren't youiserable?

10:39.225 --> 10:41.260
I have a very strong will.

10:41.328 --> 10:45.564
Rossitanos have refused
to fight in seven wars.

10:45.632 --> 10:46.632
I don't buy it.

10:46.633 --> 10:47.766
There is no way that guy

10:47.767 --> 10:49.735
Is stronger than me.
- Or me.

10:49.803 --> 10:51.403
He's got to be
sneaking cigarettes.

10:51.404 --> 10:52.738
You're the one
living with him.

10:52.739 --> 10:53.872
Catch him in the act.

10:53.873 --> 10:55.507
Yeah. I still have
his old cigarette pack.

10:55.508 --> 10:56.909
I will leave it out
tonight as a trap,

10:56.910 --> 10:57.910
And set up a video camera.

10:57.911 --> 10:59.044
Good idea. Nanny cam.

10:59.045 --> 11:00.312
Just like the
one our nanny used

11:00.313 --> 11:01.580
To catch me
watching her sleep.

11:01.581 --> 11:03.148
High five.

11:06.653 --> 11:08.987
Hi. I was told I'd get paid

11:09.055 --> 11:11.990
If I came here and danced while
the atlanta hawks eat dinner.

11:12.058 --> 11:13.792
All: Surprise!

11:13.793 --> 11:17.329
Oh, my god!

11:17.397 --> 11:18.931
Mom, you remembered.

11:18.932 --> 11:20.699
Well, of course I remembered.

11:20.700 --> 11:21.967
Come here, sweetie.

11:21.968 --> 11:23.736
I've seen this before.

11:23.737 --> 11:25.871
Classic colleen move.

11:25.939 --> 11:27.406
Whatever it is verna wants,

11:27.407 --> 11:29.274
She's going to
ask for it tonight,

11:29.275 --> 11:30.342
And jenna can't say no

11:30.343 --> 11:31.443
In front of all these people.

11:31.444 --> 11:33.445
My mother once
won a radio contest

11:33.513 --> 11:35.614
To announce the starting
lineups at a red sox game,

11:35.682 --> 11:36.949
And used the opportunity

11:36.950 --> 11:39.251
To get me to promise
never to put her in a home.

11:39.319 --> 11:40.919
What could I do?

11:40.920 --> 11:42.588
Carl yastrzemski was
looking right at me.

11:42.589 --> 11:43.589
This isn't about you,

11:43.590 --> 11:44.990
So you need to get
over your issues

11:44.991 --> 11:46.191
And try to be happy for jenna.

11:46.192 --> 11:47.693
Speaking of issues,

11:47.694 --> 11:49.294
I had a dream the other
night that we were married

11:49.295 --> 11:51.195
And I gave birth to
a cartoon cat, so...

11:52.365 --> 11:53.465
Could I have

11:53.466 --> 11:55.366
Everybody's attention, please?

11:55.368 --> 11:56.835
Thank you.

11:56.836 --> 12:01.473
In my life, I've
been a lot of things-

12:01.541 --> 12:03.542
A liar.

12:03.610 --> 12:05.144
A dental hygienist.

12:05.145 --> 12:07.646
But I haven't always been

12:07.714 --> 12:09.281
A good mom.

12:09.282 --> 12:11.316
Jenna, honey, I don't
know if you remember,

12:11.384 --> 12:13.218
But when you were 11,

12:13.219 --> 12:15.119
We were supposed
to sing together

12:15.121 --> 12:17.322
At a mother-daughter
talent pageant.

12:17.390 --> 12:19.358
I had completely
forgotten about that.

12:19.426 --> 12:21.326
What betrayal?

12:21.361 --> 12:23.862
Well, I was drinking
pretty heavily then...

12:23.930 --> 12:26.265
On account of my bad knee.

12:26.332 --> 12:28.934
And then I went
and drove my jet ski

12:29.002 --> 12:33.005
Into that great
big bunch of moss.

12:33.072 --> 12:35.908
So I did not make
it to that pageant.

12:35.975 --> 12:40.145
Honey, I don't deserve
a single thing from you,

12:40.213 --> 12:42.080
But I've got to ask one favor.

12:42.081 --> 12:43.849
And it's a big one.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.686
If you would do me
the very great honor

12:47.754 --> 12:49.988
Of joining me?

12:50.056 --> 12:51.023
Hit it.

12:53.092 --> 12:56.495
do that to me one more time

12:56.563 --> 12:58.697
once is never enough

12:58.765 --> 13:03.635
with a daughter like you

13:03.703 --> 13:06.638
do that to me one more time

13:06.706 --> 13:09.508
I can never get enough

13:09.576 --> 13:12.044
of a mom like you

13:12.111 --> 13:14.279
oh

13:14.347 --> 13:18.050
Both: kiss me

13:18.117 --> 13:21.153
like you just did

13:21.221 --> 13:22.721
How are you not moved by this?

13:22.722 --> 13:26.358
Because I'm listening
to the words.

13:26.426 --> 13:30.429
Both: do that to me once again

13:37.068 --> 13:38.502
Verna.

13:38.503 --> 13:40.070
Hey.

13:40.071 --> 13:42.172
Nice office, jack.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.774
I feel like I'm in

13:43.775 --> 13:45.675
The martha stewart
section of kmart.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.211
What can I do for you?

13:47.212 --> 13:50.714
Oh, well, I just
wanted to thank you

13:50.782 --> 13:52.015
For coming to the party.

13:52.016 --> 13:53.584
It meant a lot to jenna.

13:53.585 --> 13:55.552
And it was pretty
important to me too.

13:55.620 --> 13:58.655
See, now you know what
the show would be like.

13:58.723 --> 13:59.723
What show?

13:59.724 --> 14:03.126
Jack, I did not drive my home

14:03.194 --> 14:04.862
All the way to new york city

14:04.863 --> 14:07.631
Just to kiss my
daughter's ass.

14:07.699 --> 14:10.000
Thank you.

14:10.068 --> 14:12.169
I want to do a tv
show about me and her.

14:12.237 --> 14:14.538
You want to do a reality show?

14:14.606 --> 14:15.606
Come on.

14:15.607 --> 14:17.207
You see how good I am

14:17.208 --> 14:19.810
At pushing jenna's buttons.

14:19.878 --> 14:24.281
Yeah, this show will
have laughter, tears,

14:24.349 --> 14:25.916
Topless arguments.

14:25.917 --> 14:28.852
Infections caused
by jacuzzi water.

14:28.920 --> 14:29.953
I knew it.

14:29.954 --> 14:32.289
I knew you had
something up your sleeve

14:32.357 --> 14:34.925
Besides a tattoo
with, let me guess-

14:34.993 --> 14:37.094
It's a mermaid.

14:37.161 --> 14:39.429
Doing it with captain morgan.

14:39.497 --> 14:41.031
Now, come on, jack.

14:41.032 --> 14:44.201
We both understand
the value of a dollar.

14:44.269 --> 14:45.669
Oop.

14:45.670 --> 14:48.839
Now won't you please
do me this favor?

14:48.907 --> 14:50.274
Talk to jenna.

14:50.275 --> 14:53.777
There's a lot more
where that come from.

14:53.845 --> 14:57.648
Which is in my underpanties.

15:01.819 --> 15:03.120
come in.

15:03.121 --> 15:05.656
Jenna, I was right.

15:05.723 --> 15:06.957
I was right all along.

15:06.958 --> 15:08.959
What's that?

15:09.027 --> 15:11.228
Oh. New earrings.

15:11.296 --> 15:12.462
My mom just made them.

15:12.463 --> 15:14.164
So they still might
have some pigeon mites.

15:14.165 --> 15:17.200
But she said those can't
affect-affect humans-humans.

15:17.268 --> 15:18.702
Yes, well, it
certainly is amazing

15:18.703 --> 15:20.704
To see how your mother
has made this 180.

15:20.772 --> 15:21.838
It's even better, jack.

15:21.839 --> 15:26.209
She's made a full 360.

15:26.277 --> 15:27.477
Well, I just wanted to come by

15:27.478 --> 15:29.146
And make sure you're okay.

15:29.147 --> 15:30.914
I'm glad to see
you're so happy.

15:30.915 --> 15:32.416
I am happy.

15:32.417 --> 15:35.218
Because now I have everything.

15:39.490 --> 15:41.224
Good morning, dummies.

15:42.660 --> 15:46.129
So frank can go cold
turkey but I can't?

15:46.197 --> 15:48.231
Well, well, well.

15:48.299 --> 15:50.434
Frank's old cigarettes.

15:50.501 --> 15:52.135
When I went to bed last night,

15:52.136 --> 15:54.071
There were 15
cigarettes in the pack.

15:54.138 --> 15:55.405
This morning, there were 12.

15:55.406 --> 15:56.974
<i>What?
- J'accuse!</i>

15:56.975 --> 15:59.343
Look, I don't know where
those cigarettes went.

15:59.410 --> 16:00.844
If only some genius

16:00.845 --> 16:03.947
Had secretly videotaped
her living room last night.

16:04.015 --> 16:06.984
Oh, wait. It did.

16:07.051 --> 16:08.951
Hang on. You videotaped
your living room?

16:08.953 --> 16:09.987
All night?

16:09.988 --> 16:10.988
Sure did.

16:10.989 --> 16:11.989
And as soon as I figure out

16:11.990 --> 16:12.990
Which one of these things

16:12.991 --> 16:14.124
Is the thingy...

16:14.125 --> 16:15.125
Coming at you.

16:15.126 --> 16:17.694
Gimme.

16:17.762 --> 16:18.962
You didn't believe in me.

16:18.963 --> 16:20.664
But I believed in myself.

16:20.665 --> 16:22.099
Just like the last scene

16:22.100 --> 16:24.134
Of all movies.

16:24.202 --> 16:27.437
Okay. Here we go.

16:27.505 --> 16:28.939
What are you wearing?

16:28.940 --> 16:30.874
Both: They're
called night spanx.

16:30.942 --> 16:32.342
I don't even
remember getting up.

16:32.343 --> 16:33.343
What am I doing?

16:33.344 --> 16:34.611
You're sleepwalking, liz.

16:34.612 --> 16:37.948
It's a little-understood
parasomnial disorder.

16:39.017 --> 16:39.983
That's gross.

16:39.984 --> 16:41.218
<i>She's not sleep walking.</i>

16:41.219 --> 16:44.321
<i>Oh, my god. I'm sleep eating.</i>

16:44.389 --> 16:46.056
You tried to take
away your release, liz,

16:46.057 --> 16:47.457
But nature finds a way.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.326
<i>Did you learn nothing
from jurassic park?</i>

16:49.327 --> 16:50.894
Why am I making a phone call?

16:58.069 --> 16:59.669
Okay, I don't mean to be
the black guy at the movie,

16:59.670 --> 17:01.071
But you better move, girl!

17:02.106 --> 17:04.074
Uh-oh.

17:04.142 --> 17:06.276
Oh, liz, you didn't!

17:06.344 --> 17:08.145
I ordered a pizza?

17:09.614 --> 17:11.080
Oh!

17:11.082 --> 17:12.082
Oh, I don't want to see this.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.083
Okay, fine.

17:13.084 --> 17:14.217
I cheated in my sleep.

17:14.218 --> 17:15.585
But frank folded too,

17:15.586 --> 17:17.486
Because I am not making
it up about the cigarettes.

17:17.521 --> 17:20.824
Any minute he's gonna- -
wait, what are you doing now?

17:20.892 --> 17:22.726
No. No. Please, no.

17:22.727 --> 17:25.462
Oh, god, liz. You
didn't smoke the

17:26.763 --> 17:28.531
I'm eating it.

17:28.532 --> 17:30.634
Okay, well, mystery solved.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.769
Liz ate the cigarettes,

17:32.837 --> 17:33.837
And I guess some of us

17:33.838 --> 17:34.838
Just don't need a release.

17:34.839 --> 17:36.139
So let's turn the tv off.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.809
Hang on.

17:38.876 --> 17:39.876
Oh, thanks, frank.

17:39.877 --> 17:41.278
Oh, there's more.

17:41.279 --> 17:44.681
Denise, I said wait upstairs.

17:44.749 --> 17:46.783
My boss is asleep
in the other room.

17:46.851 --> 17:48.251
I was told

17:48.252 --> 17:52.856
You have a package
for the mail room.

17:52.924 --> 17:54.224
Oh, come on!

17:54.225 --> 17:55.292
This just got awesome.

17:55.293 --> 17:56.626
I need you, denise.

17:56.627 --> 17:58.028
I'm trying to quit smoking,

17:58.029 --> 18:00.330
And my mom's not here.

18:00.398 --> 18:02.332
I'm your mama now, baby.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.668
don't go to sleep

18:04.735 --> 18:07.170
with a frown in your pocket

18:07.238 --> 18:10.240
go into your yard

18:10.308 --> 18:11.875
and tie it on a rocket

18:11.876 --> 18:13.743
This is the worst
thing I've ever seen.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.313
you'll be feeling better soon

18:16.380 --> 18:20.217
Both: don't go to
bed with a frown

18:20.284 --> 18:22.219
I love you, denise mommy.

18:27.091 --> 18:28.991
We all need our release.

18:31.929 --> 18:33.497
Verna,

18:33.498 --> 18:35.098
I want to be in
business with you.

18:35.099 --> 18:36.999
Oh! Ho, ho, ho!

18:37.001 --> 18:39.536
We are gonna be
swimming in green, jack.

18:39.604 --> 18:43.440
Just like when I dye my
pool on st. Patrick's day.

18:43.508 --> 18:44.708
I do have a couple of notes.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.510
This project will not be about

18:46.511 --> 18:48.411
Drama or dysfunction.

18:48.479 --> 18:49.479
People are tired of that.

18:49.480 --> 18:50.914
Well, so what's it about?

18:50.915 --> 18:52.249
Redemption.

18:52.250 --> 18:55.152
It's about a mother making
amends to her daughter.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.219
And it's not a show.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.120
It's four visits per year-

18:58.122 --> 18:59.456
Christmas, mother's day,

18:59.457 --> 19:02.259
Jenna's birthday,
and thanksgiving.

19:02.326 --> 19:04.594
You treat jenna with
the respect she deserves,

19:04.662 --> 19:06.096
You get a check.

19:06.097 --> 19:07.097
You're trying to bribe me

19:07.098 --> 19:08.165
Into being a good mom.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.966
Well, it is all
just about money,

19:09.967 --> 19:11.301
Isn't it, verna?

19:11.302 --> 19:12.869
Well, maybe for me.

19:12.870 --> 19:16.273
But this is emotional
for you, isn't it?

19:16.340 --> 19:20.577
And I believe that
gives me the upper hand,

19:20.645 --> 19:22.612
And you're gonna have to pay.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.447
Big.

19:24.448 --> 19:25.982
3 grand a visit,

19:25.983 --> 19:27.984
And a rain tarp for
my washer and dryer.

19:28.052 --> 19:29.686
Deal.

19:29.687 --> 19:31.188
Verna, stop stroking my palm

19:31.189 --> 19:32.155
With your middle finger.

19:32.156 --> 19:33.456
This is a businessransaction.

19:33.457 --> 19:34.858
Sorry.

19:34.859 --> 19:36.759
Whoo-hoo, mr. Big stuff.

19:36.761 --> 19:38.628
Dudley's father went outside

19:38.629 --> 19:39.996
And lit a cigarette.

19:39.997 --> 19:41.464
In the next episode-

19:41.465 --> 19:43.567
Good morning, pete, kenneth.
- Liz.

19:43.634 --> 19:46.236
If you are spending your
mornings with kenneth,

19:46.304 --> 19:47.304
What's your release?

19:47.305 --> 19:49.039
Uh...

19:49.040 --> 19:51.741
Oh, I feel alive!

19:51.809 --> 19:53.310
I've been biting my nails.

19:53.311 --> 19:55.312
Oh.

19:55.379 --> 19:58.181
Hey, liz.

19:58.249 --> 20:00.050
Verna's coming back
for mother's day.

20:00.051 --> 20:02.319
<i>We're gonna do a duet
of I'll make love to you</i>

20:02.386 --> 20:04.187
At a children's hospital.

20:04.188 --> 20:05.655
That's great, jenna.

20:05.656 --> 20:07.090
Hey, jack, guess what?

20:07.091 --> 20:09.125
Verna's coming back
for mother's day.

20:09.193 --> 20:11.093
She is? What a surprise.

20:11.095 --> 20:14.664
So I guess you were 100%
wrong about everything.

20:14.732 --> 20:17.434
Think about that, jack.

20:29.347 --> 20:31.982
You're a good
man, jack donaghy.

20:32.049 --> 20:33.717
Thanks, meat cat.

20:36.323 --> 20:40.040
Transcript by addic7ed.com

20:40.075 --> 20:43.521
I've got an idea for
a show called Doctor.

20:43.556 --> 20:46.325
About Richard Doctor,
who's a piano player.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.893
Remember that show
Jennifer slliped here.

20:48.928 --> 20:53.630
Anne Jillian plays a ghost of a
hollywood starlet who helps teenagers.

20:53.665 --> 20:56.039
With what? I don't know!

20:56.074 --> 21:00.489
Some of those people on Magic
Cane were drunk... with power.

21:00.524 --> 21:03.221
Did you know that Today Show
used to have a monkey on it.

21:03.256 --> 21:05.110
Hasn't been this good since.

21:05.787 --> 21:07.906
I think that chimp used
to drive a truck himself.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.977
On you-know-what
and the bear.

21:10.305 --> 21:16.531
