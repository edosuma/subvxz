(NARRATOR)
Previously on The Evermoor Chronicles.

00:02.800 --> 00:05.480
I turned Cameron into a tree.
I can't turn him back.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.320
I gave Bridget my powers,
and she tricked me.

00:08.480 --> 00:12.160
We will deliver you a demigod,
and you will give us your essence.

00:12.360 --> 00:17.200
Now, you must give us
three Fated villagers to inhabit.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.000
You're releasing The Founders?

00:19.160 --> 00:22.040
They brought the world to chaos,
they will do it again.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.400
(YELLS)
No!

00:24.880 --> 00:26.280
Where is our sister?

00:26.440 --> 00:29.600
The lantern was smashed in two
before her release.

00:31.920 --> 00:35.400
# I left my friends for my new life

00:35.520 --> 00:38.800
# How will I know it's gonna be all right

00:38.960 --> 00:45.280
# I gotta take control
And write my destiny

00:45.440 --> 00:50.600
# The future's still untold
Nobody else can see

00:50.800 --> 00:56.440
# If this will be for Evermoor #

01:04.920 --> 01:07.400
Thank you, I love it.

01:07.520 --> 01:11.040
-You have Valentine's Day in Evermoor?
-We call it "Day of Hearts,"

01:11.200 --> 01:16.800
but it's still the same traditions: gifts,
cards, the traditional "Hearts Day" coal!

01:16.960 --> 01:20.280
-You do that too right?
-Every year.

01:22.200 --> 01:26.320
I'm just glad we can have
this dinner tonight. Just the two of us.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.360
Ugh, don't remind me. To think
this used to be the highlight of my year.

01:31.480 --> 01:34.440
(BELLA)
My Valentine's parties were legendary.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.120
Ohh.
(SNIFFS)

01:36.320 --> 01:40.040
-What's that smell?
-"A hundred and one ways to grill cheese."

01:40.200 --> 01:42.520
Disappointment! Yeah, it's really strong.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.840
Spell reversals? Valentine spells?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.200
Where's the website for this stuff?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.760
Hot date with your laptop?
It's never gonna love you back, Tara.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.000
I'm researching cures for Cameron.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.520
-Online?
-I have to start somewhere.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.880
I don't have my powers.
I don't even have Bridget.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.880
Happy Valentine's Day to me.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.320
Come with me.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.080
-I think I might have an idea.
-Don't be late!

02:09.280 --> 02:10.600
Can't wait!

02:11.680 --> 02:14.920
-What do you think?
-I thought you'd never ask!

02:15.040 --> 02:18.120
Okay, so we need music, obviously.
Cake, napkins.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.480
-No, I was just asking about--
-This is a very important day.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.680
A chance for me to relive
my party-planning glory days.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.280
Hello? He doesn't want any help.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.400
Have you thought about candles?
(GASPS)

02:37.400 --> 02:40.600
(ESMERELDA)
Bridget? Show yourself!

02:40.800 --> 02:44.360
You have nothing to fear
from an old woman and a child!

02:44.480 --> 02:46.800
Please, she knows who we really are.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.680
Forgive me, sister,
but the thought occurs

02:51.880 --> 02:53.320
perhaps it isn't here?

02:53.480 --> 02:57.040
I realize that,
but we have to keep looking.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.920
You must find the other half
of the lantern to get our sister back.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.920
We will.
And Bridget will bind it back together.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.520
She better.
Without it, our circle is incomplete.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.040
We need that lantern

03:14.200 --> 03:18.000
if we are to ever defeat the Crossley girl
and return to power.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.640
But as far
as Tara Crossley is concerned...

03:23.840 --> 03:26.560
all I want is revenge.

03:26.760 --> 03:32.520
We shall have it
when the opportunity presents itself.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.040
(FOOTSTEPS ARRIVING)

03:36.200 --> 03:39.920
(DOOR OPENS)

03:42.080 --> 03:47.760
-It's like a library threw up.
-There must be something we can use.

03:49.600 --> 03:54.760
Potions, alchemy, palmistry.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.680
To think Aunt Bridget had all these.

03:57.880 --> 04:01.640
-What do you think happened to her?
-I can't think about that right now.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.880
-"Anche-eía Maígeía." What's that?
-Ancient Magic, but don't--

04:11.000 --> 04:17.760
"In the old times, non-Everines used
Ancient Magic mixed with stolen thread."

04:17.920 --> 04:22.320
-Is this real?
-It is forbidden and extremely dangerous.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.600
That spell shouldn't even be here.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.440
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.920
You still don't get it, do you?
This isn't a game.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.800
All I do is try and understand.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.040
Maybe I'm tired of you pretending
you have all the answers!

04:39.200 --> 04:44.440
I didn't mean that. Please.
I can't do this without you.

04:45.680 --> 04:50.600
No, you can't.
But you clearly want to, so be my guest.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.640

04:57.600 --> 05:01.920
Looks like the opportunity arrived
sooner than expected.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay, so I'm thinking six courses,
orchestra, ice sculptures.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.960
-What have you got?
-Hogsmeat.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.480
-Right, okay. What does that come with?
-More hogsmeat.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.640
Answer to the next three questions
is hogsmeat, isn't it?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.920
You've got it!

05:21.040 --> 05:24.960
You know, if it's entertainment you need,
we might just be your guys.

05:31.920 --> 05:35.280

an Evermoorian Dinglehorn before?

that doesn't mind being paid in cake?

05:47.880 --> 05:51.760
Seriously. You haven't heard him.

05:53.080 --> 05:58.960
-And you have?
-I cried, Bella. Real tears.

05:59.080 --> 06:02.880

06:05.080 --> 06:09.000
(CONTINUED HORN HONKS)

06:10.080 --> 06:12.000
Happy Day of Hearts, Cameron.

06:12.160 --> 06:15.960
I swear I'll make this up to you.
Your mom too.

06:16.080 --> 06:19.400
Mentioning the mom
in a Valentines' card? Really?

06:20.680 --> 06:24.560
-Don't you need two people for a date?
-And some privacy.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.000
No way! Anche-eía Maígeía!

06:28.160 --> 06:30.440
-Where did you get this?
-Hey.

06:30.560 --> 06:35.520
Doing a Nelly Furnish, huh? Oops, sorry,
we're not supposed to talk about it.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.000
Talk about what?

06:39.680 --> 06:44.480
You don't know? I mean...
(SCOFFS) it was ages ago.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.880
They say a girl called Nelly Furnish

06:47.000 --> 06:51.280
used Ancient Magic on the Day of Hearts
to save the boy she loved.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.120
-Crazy, right?
-Nuts.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.360
Just a week after their wedding,
Nelly's husband, Bertie,

06:57.480 --> 07:00.760
joined up as a Dung Rustler
in The Great Bog War.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.600
Before he left,
she wove him a necklace of golden thread.

07:05.800 --> 07:09.000
When Bertie didn't return,
she feared the worst.

07:09.160 --> 07:13.000
That he had become trapped,
forever, in the bog.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.440
What did she do?

07:14.560 --> 07:17.440
She said the words
and activated the thread.

07:17.560 --> 07:21.280
Bertie reanimated and came home,
and they lived happily--

07:21.440 --> 07:24.880
-Ever after? Is this true?
-Everything you need is right here.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.600
Look, great story and everything,
but I can't.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.000
Sorsha would never forgive me.

-You're beautiful.

Parents are always there

08:12.520 --> 08:15.400
on the Day of Hearts,
isn't that right, Mrs. Crossley?

08:15.520 --> 08:20.000
Oh, well, you know what they say.
Two's company, and three's a bit weird.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.680
This is an Evermoorian tradition.
To flout it is to insult us.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.080
-Count me in.
-Ah.

08:36.160 --> 08:38.560

Interesting notion of revenge.
Giving her what she wants.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.640
Yes. How naughty of me.

Lucky guess.
Seb, you're a scientist, back me up here!

10:18.120 --> 10:22.000
You don't believe in magic.
He's starting to. Aren't you, Seb?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.960
From the guy
that thinks magic is for kids, right?

10:26.080 --> 10:30.040
What was it you said? "For people
with more imagination than sense." Right?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.800
Yes, but in a good way.

on The Day of Hearts!

-What, turn him into a monster?
-What?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.440
Nelly didn't finish
the incantation either.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.560
Bertie Furnish returned as a monster

11:23.720 --> 11:26.400
and at midnight
dragged her screaming to the bog.

to let down the fans.

They'll be pretty disappointed,
especially after we promised but...

16:30.720 --> 16:32.680
Wait, no!

16:32.840 --> 16:37.600
(RUMBLING)

16:43.920 --> 16:47.920
I almost forgot. Your card.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
It's from an old painting.
Sorry, it's a bit corny.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.280
Seb, look at the words.

17:00.400 --> 17:06.920
-"Ina uno Savium proto."
-Of course! "True love's first kiss."

17:07.040 --> 17:12.440
Ancient magic doesn't work alone.
It's powered by love.

17:12.640 --> 17:16.760
The most ancient
and powerful magic of all.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.840
It can cross cultures...

17:21.080 --> 17:23.960
It can defeat enemies.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.360
It's the bond between sisters...

17:33.000 --> 17:34.640
or between mother and son.

17:47.560 --> 17:52.200
And the most powerful magic of all
is true love's first kiss.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.280
Hey.

17:58.880 --> 18:04.400
-What did I miss?
-Not much. It's good to have you back.

18:04.600 --> 18:08.080
-How did you know what to do?
-You remembered?

18:08.240 --> 18:10.400
I remember what woke me up.

18:12.240 --> 18:16.320
Thank you... for not giving up on me.

18:17.880 --> 18:22.240
Don't! I mean, save it guys.
The rest of us have eaten.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I best get home.
I've got some explaining to do.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.600
It's not what you both think, okay?
It's one hundred times worse.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.280
What are you babbling about?

18:36.440 --> 18:40.640
You know what? I don't care.
All that matters is Cameron's safe.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.400
Duno potassium monat,
mai ace senta nomendusia.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.120
-She cheated. That's my thing.
-Her time will come.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.600
When? How long must it take--

18:51.760 --> 18:54.000
-Look!
-Bridget!

19:00.080 --> 19:03.280
We have it. We will be three again!

19:03.440 --> 19:06.880
-It's broken.
-Are you never happy?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.880
Our sister can't be released
until it's repaired.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.320
And there's only one person
who can do that.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.400
If you knew the language,
why not say something?

19:18.600 --> 19:20.000
I hoped I wouldn't have to.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.280
Otto, you really need
to start making some sense.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.160
"Ina uno savium proto"
doesn't mean true love's kiss.

19:27.320 --> 19:31.120
-It means "Only one first kiss."
-What are you talking about?

19:31.280 --> 19:36.840
Everines were never supposed to mess
with Ancient Magic, let alone the Supreme.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.040
If you and Cameron kiss each other again,
it's over.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.600
He'll go right back to being a tree.
Forever.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.760
You can never be together.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.680
Next time on The Evermoor Chronicles...

19:50.840 --> 19:53.040
(GASPS) The Founders are coming!

19:53.200 --> 19:57.000
Bella Crossley
may not be the true Supreme.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.920
-What happened to you?
-Everything.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.160
-A test?
-You can't refuse to take the test.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.360
If you refuse, the old laws say
that you'll be dropped into the bog.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.520
Okay, listen,
I'm not the Supreme. Oh, no, no, no!

20:12.680 --> 20:15.280
(BELLA SCREAMS)
