00:45.061 --> 00:47.183
Well, Mr. Dawkins,

00:47.467 --> 00:52.223
why have you gathered us all here?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.515
There's no respect for the law anymore.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.569
We're looking for Mick and Tim O'Shea.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.351
You do agree that women are
deserving of the right to vote?

01:00.386 --> 01:03.738
I intend to see that women's
suffrage is achieved in my lifetime.

01:03.752 --> 01:05.369
Lads!

01:06.891 --> 01:08.911
Get off of her!

01:11.712 --> 01:15.188
- Take your hands off me!
- Mick O'Shea?

01:18.298 --> 01:20.105
You should have listened.

01:20.139 --> 01:22.206
We own the waterfront.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.792
_

01:28.821 --> 01:31.115
Where are Mick and Tim O'Shea?

01:32.517 --> 01:35.086
- I've never seen them.
- Don't lie to me.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.996
- If you have any idea where they are...
- I don't.

01:38.523 --> 01:42.493
I want it known that the Constabulary
are done with mucking about.

01:42.527 --> 01:45.562
I know you're frightened, but
they assaulted a policeman.

01:45.597 --> 01:48.075
- Leave me alone.
- Look, if there's anything you can tell me,

01:48.112 --> 01:50.582
- there won't be any repercussions.
- I said leave me alone.

01:50.591 --> 01:52.676
Listen! If you know anything
about the O'Shea brothers,

01:52.685 --> 01:55.246
- you'll tell me.
- Detective Murdoch!

01:55.621 --> 01:58.411
Detective Murdoch!

01:58.621 --> 02:00.057
Sir.

02:03.217 --> 02:05.027
Who did this to you?

02:05.147 --> 02:08.622
Who did this to you? Was it the O'Sheas?

02:09.088 --> 02:11.749
He said his name was Brackenreid.

02:22.397 --> 02:25.159
It was him who done it. Almost killed me.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.931
Why?

02:27.711 --> 02:30.834
He wanted to know about the
O'Sheas. Where they went.

02:30.868 --> 02:32.836
Well, I'd like to know the same thing.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.112
Where are they?

02:34.853 --> 02:38.529
In all honesty, it wouldn't surprise me
if they were on a boat back to Ireland.

02:40.231 --> 02:42.856
Listen. You attacked me.

02:42.976 --> 02:45.655
I'm a police officer. You
attacked several others.

02:45.664 --> 02:47.852
I will see you rot in the Don Jail

02:47.869 --> 02:49.698
if you don't tell me what you know.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.109
Now, what happened to Richard Dawkins?

02:54.481 --> 02:57.253
- The O'Sheas killed him.
- Did you see them do it?

02:57.373 --> 02:58.460
No.

02:59.127 --> 03:01.158
But they did. Everyone knows that.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.468
- And the woman?
- I don't know about any woman.

03:04.478 --> 03:07.857
The drowned woman. The one
that was shackled and chained.

03:08.347 --> 03:10.092
I don't know.

03:13.314 --> 03:15.911
On my word, I don't know!

03:17.283 --> 03:18.682
I'm already a dead man

03:18.701 --> 03:20.902
if Mick O'Shea finds out I talked to you.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.716
Why did the O'Sheas kill Richard Dawkins?

03:29.245 --> 03:31.570
Probably because he didn't pay.

03:31.836 --> 03:34.863
Or maybe because they were told to.

03:34.891 --> 03:36.528
Explain that.

03:39.993 --> 03:42.399
The O'Sheas have been extracting payments

03:42.426 --> 03:44.438
from all of the merchants
down at the docks.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.843
If they refused, cargo
was left on ships to rot,

03:47.887 --> 03:50.331
goods weren't delivered,
storefronts were vandalized,

03:50.365 --> 03:53.360
- and in more extreme cases...
- You get Mr. Dawkins.

03:53.935 --> 03:56.309
He refused to pay up and
the O'Sheas killed him.

03:56.331 --> 03:57.912
I don't know.

03:57.919 --> 04:00.633
Mr. Ridgeway seems to think
the O'Sheas aren't acting alone.

04:00.684 --> 04:02.060
That someone else is involved.

04:02.067 --> 04:04.245
And, of course, he has no idea who that is.

04:04.365 --> 04:07.190
If he does, I'm inclined to believe
he'll take that to the grave.

04:07.417 --> 04:08.873
I see.

04:09.951 --> 04:11.952
Murdoch...

04:13.770 --> 04:16.488
Did Thomas Brackenreid beat that man?

04:18.233 --> 04:20.410
I will not have him walk
over the rules of law.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.112
Nor will you.

04:22.931 --> 04:26.200
I might have an overly friendly
demeanour, but I am an honest cop.

04:27.105 --> 04:28.829
If Thomas Brackenreid

04:28.834 --> 04:30.874
did something unwarranted,

04:31.212 --> 04:33.173
I will do my duty.

04:35.738 --> 04:37.915
- Oh, and Murdoch?
- Yes.

04:37.952 --> 04:40.266
You're aware that your
fiancée is in custody?

04:40.266 --> 04:41.885
Oh yes, yes.

04:42.005 --> 04:44.034
I've spoken with her.

04:44.345 --> 04:45.891
Alright.

04:55.487 --> 04:58.030
Oh, Lord. Look.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.917
Oh my.

05:05.032 --> 05:08.718
- Dr. Grace. Julia.
- Mr. Garland.

05:09.532 --> 05:12.444
It appears you are both caught
in an unfortunate circumstance.

05:13.263 --> 05:15.047
And what are you doing here?

05:15.167 --> 05:17.031
I'm articling for the Crown Prosecutor.

05:17.072 --> 05:18.330
You didn't hear the news?

05:18.584 --> 05:19.720
I passed the bar.

05:19.994 --> 05:22.620
Your accomplishments are hardly
a matter of interest to me.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.184
I see.

05:24.184 --> 05:26.739
I could have a few words with the Crown,

05:26.772 --> 05:28.748
I know he'll listen to me. I could

05:29.123 --> 05:31.362
advocate leniency on your behalf.

05:31.396 --> 05:34.620
- Both of you, actually.
- And the others?

05:35.690 --> 05:38.302
Well, I'm not a miracle worker.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.304
Then we need no favours from you.

05:40.894 --> 05:42.458
Do you feel the same way, Emily?

05:42.477 --> 05:45.750
You'd rather not know
how I feel, Mr. Garland.

05:46.845 --> 05:48.247
Have it your way.

05:48.367 --> 05:51.009
But you should remember
I offered to help you.

05:51.448 --> 05:53.616
It's a shame you refused.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.661
That little pissant.

05:58.781 --> 06:02.136
- Julia!
- Well, he is.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.830
Mrs. McKinnon. Thank you for coming.

06:10.857 --> 06:13.684
I cannot persuade you to call me Cecily?

06:13.804 --> 06:15.732
Please, have a seat.

06:24.691 --> 06:28.277
That was an impressive show of
force you demonstrated yesterday.

06:29.329 --> 06:32.848
Thank you. Unfortunately, the
men we were after got away.

06:33.607 --> 06:35.227
Tim and Mick O'Shea.

06:35.245 --> 06:38.727
Yes, they do seem to possess
a certain animal cunning.

06:39.626 --> 06:43.083
Mrs. McKinnon, have you heard
of them extorting people?

06:43.294 --> 06:45.635
The services of wharfies and stevedores

06:45.672 --> 06:47.936
being denied if payments aren't made?

06:48.663 --> 06:50.227
I don't know anything.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.925
There's no need to be
afraid, Mrs. McKinnon.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.578
With Mr. Dawkins dead,

06:55.698 --> 06:57.919
and now that woman, how can you say that?

06:57.937 --> 06:59.684
The police will protect you.

07:00.937 --> 07:02.065
Well,

07:02.185 --> 07:04.422
if you say that the O'Sheas
are extorting people,

07:04.440 --> 07:06.306
then I suppose that's possible.

07:07.267 --> 07:09.059
And who else?

07:10.650 --> 07:13.385
I don't believe the
O'Sheas are acting alone.

07:13.413 --> 07:15.306
Someone else is involved.

07:16.432 --> 07:18.251
Do you know of anyone else

07:18.279 --> 07:21.569
who may be preying on
their fellow merchants?

07:24.473 --> 07:26.473
This won't come back on me?

07:28.309 --> 07:30.516
Lionel Jeffries does appear

07:30.552 --> 07:33.205
to be buying out businesses
at an alarming rate.

07:33.214 --> 07:37.051
I think he means to take
control of the entire harbour.

07:37.988 --> 07:40.387
Thank you, Mrs. McKinnon.

07:40.421 --> 07:43.022
And remember, you needn't
worry about the O'Sheas.

07:43.057 --> 07:44.958
I'll find them.

07:54.954 --> 07:58.938
- Who's there?
- Do you remember me, Mr. Jeffries?

07:58.973 --> 08:01.018
- Thomas Brackenreid.
- Of course.

08:01.027 --> 08:03.130
The policeman who was down here months ago.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.832
I've got one or two questions for you.

08:04.877 --> 08:07.264
I have talked to the
Constabulary repeatedly.

08:07.292 --> 08:08.929
I'm not sure what I could add.

08:09.049 --> 08:10.959
Where are Mick and Tim O'Shea?

08:11.079 --> 08:13.301
The comings and goings of
a couple of drunk Irishmen

08:13.319 --> 08:15.322
are not something I concern myself with.

08:16.156 --> 08:17.938
When I was here last,

08:18.058 --> 08:21.679
you bragged about how you knew all
there was to know about this place.

08:21.898 --> 08:24.011
- Now where are they?
- I don't know.

08:24.498 --> 08:28.000
They almost killed me. They've
attacked another copper.

08:28.034 --> 08:31.174
- I'll not be leaving here without an answer.
- I don't know.

08:31.182 --> 08:33.203
Then I'll take your best guess!

08:34.174 --> 08:36.678
And just to let you know, Jeffries,

08:36.715 --> 08:38.690
I'm not a copper anymore,

08:38.900 --> 08:42.514
so there are no niceties
that I need to abide to.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.697
Will the accused please rise.

08:45.953 --> 08:49.283
You have all been charged
with unlawful assembly and

08:49.319 --> 08:51.817
causing a public nuisance.

08:52.124 --> 08:53.258
- How do you plead?
- I...

08:53.259 --> 08:55.082
Your Honour,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.654
we should like to add a
charge of common assault.

08:57.655 --> 08:58.655
Noted.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.799
Which one of you

09:00.833 --> 09:02.985
attacked the man in question?

09:03.105 --> 09:04.595
I did.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.479
Enough. One more word

09:06.488 --> 09:09.907
and I will hold you all in contempt.

09:09.942 --> 09:12.043
Be seated.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.208
Excuse us,

09:17.328 --> 09:21.333
- may we help you, madam?
- Yes, Your Honour. May I speak?

09:21.453 --> 09:25.559
This has been an unusual enough day in
court already, so I don't see why not.

09:25.679 --> 09:27.406
My name is Clara Brett Martin.

09:27.836 --> 09:30.415
I have standing with the
Law Society of Upper Canada.

09:30.452 --> 09:32.270
How extraordinary.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.264
So, what can we do for you?

09:34.298 --> 09:36.121
I would like to represent the women

09:36.122 --> 09:37.997
who are currently facing charges.

09:38.043 --> 09:39.872
That is, with your permission, of course.

09:39.992 --> 09:42.241
- This could certainly help our cause.
- Of course.

09:42.259 --> 09:44.591
Sir. This can't be permitted.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.317
An accused does deserve
the right to council.

09:47.518 --> 09:50.023
You are a lawyer, aren't you, Miss Martin?

09:50.024 --> 09:52.363
- You're not having one over on me?
- No, Your Honour.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.365
I'm the first female lawyer
in all of the British Empire.

09:55.485 --> 09:59.722
Well, this could be quite
something for you, Atkinson.

09:59.757 --> 10:02.975
- I will permit it.
- I object to this, sir.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.335
Don't be such a poor sport.

10:05.536 --> 10:07.219
Thank you, Your Honour.

10:07.950 --> 10:10.767
I would like some time with my
clients to properly prepare a defense.

10:10.786 --> 10:12.182
Of course.

10:12.469 --> 10:14.636
We will continue two days hence.

10:16.822 --> 10:19.441
- Thank you, Miss Martin.
- Please.

10:19.475 --> 10:20.481
Clara.

10:21.112 --> 10:22.301
Clara.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.201
- Julia Ogden.
- Hello.

10:26.939 --> 10:29.317
You need to hear him out.

10:32.373 --> 10:34.523
Mr. Jeffries.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.838
- I was visited by Thomas Brackenreid.
- You were?

10:38.958 --> 10:42.607
- He's no longer an active policeman, am I correct?
- You are.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.564
Then I would like to lodge a complaint.

10:44.684 --> 10:45.918
He manhandled me.

10:45.927 --> 10:49.348
- You appear to be suffering no ill effects.
- Murdoch.

10:50.505 --> 10:53.241
He broke into my shop
like a common criminal.

10:53.564 --> 10:55.509
Then I'll speak with him.

10:55.544 --> 10:57.419
What did he say?

10:57.423 --> 10:59.170
He wanted to know where the O'Sheas were.

10:59.179 --> 11:02.082
I'd very much like that
information as well.

11:02.116 --> 11:04.228
You see, Mr. Jeffries,
it's come to my attention

11:04.255 --> 11:06.954
that the O'Sheas have been
extorting money from the merchants.

11:06.988 --> 11:09.757
- Not from me.
- It's also come to my attention

11:09.791 --> 11:11.826
that they may be working for someone.

11:14.003 --> 11:16.863
- I hope you're not insinuating...
- Mr. Jeffries,

11:17.158 --> 11:20.834
if you know where the
O'Sheas hang their hat,

11:20.868 --> 11:22.769
you had best tell me.

11:22.803 --> 11:25.538
If only to clear your own name.

11:32.626 --> 11:36.248
Hello? Anyone here?

11:38.251 --> 11:40.830
It seems the O'Sheas
enjoyed gracious living.

11:47.036 --> 11:49.990
Alright, you. Get up.

11:57.246 --> 11:59.341
Sir.

12:23.896 --> 12:27.427
- George.
- Doctor Ogden, how are you two ladies faring?

12:28.168 --> 12:29.832
As well as can be expected.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.932
If you want my opinion, one shouldn't
be jailed for speaking one's mind.

12:33.052 --> 12:35.027
Thank you, George.

12:35.147 --> 12:36.875
Dr. Grace, you need to come with me.

12:36.903 --> 12:39.089
I'm bringing her to the morgue.
I'll return her when I'm finished.

12:39.116 --> 12:42.482
- George, I am prepared to face the charges.
- Yes, and you no doubt will.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.355
And I do hope you triumph. But in
the meantime, the Detective needs you.

12:45.573 --> 12:47.247
Oh.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.990
Dr. Ogden, is there anything else
I can get for you in the meantime?

12:53.347 --> 12:56.667
- A pillow.
- Now, Doctor, you're being highly unreasonable.

12:58.925 --> 13:00.800
I'll see what I can do.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.839
Both men were shot in the temple;
it would appear at close range.

13:05.857 --> 13:09.461
From the angle of entry, I would
conclude they were both kneeling.

13:09.690 --> 13:12.488
- Another execution.
- But this one not so public.

13:13.010 --> 13:15.534
I'm afraid there's not
much more I can tell you.

13:15.569 --> 13:17.603
- I should return to the cells.
- Right.

13:17.637 --> 13:19.638
Thank you, Doctor.

13:26.946 --> 13:29.259
I'm sorry we had to keep
you in custody so long.

13:29.282 --> 13:31.684
It was only so that you'd be
protected from the O'Sheas.

13:31.718 --> 13:33.952
So why am I safe now?

13:33.986 --> 13:36.375
Because those men are dead now.

13:36.756 --> 13:38.268
Did you kill them?

13:38.506 --> 13:41.506
No, son, we're the police.
We don't just kill people.

13:41.735 --> 13:45.732
- We arrest them, send them off to the courts.
- But you kill people sometimes.

13:46.015 --> 13:48.200
Only when there's no other choice.

13:48.585 --> 13:51.269
Well, my mother will probably... kill me.

13:52.252 --> 13:54.972
- Simon!
- Hello, mother.

13:55.372 --> 13:58.408
I was so worried about you.

13:59.478 --> 14:03.180
- What did you do this time?
- Well, I...

14:05.351 --> 14:06.897
George Crabtree?

14:07.656 --> 14:09.286
Miss Garrison!

14:10.071 --> 14:13.157
- It's been so long.
- Years.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.127
And it's Brooks now, not Garrison.

14:16.247 --> 14:17.387
Ah.

14:17.406 --> 14:19.729
When Constable Higgins told
me he was taken into custody,

14:19.738 --> 14:21.595
I had half a mind to leave him there.

14:22.116 --> 14:25.001
- What did he do?
- Well, he...

14:26.479 --> 14:29.314
provided the Constabulary with
some very useful information.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.108
There was a crime and
Simon here came forward.

14:32.698 --> 14:34.110
And, uh...

14:34.463 --> 14:37.180
how did he come to be
in a position to do that?

14:37.300 --> 14:39.739
I'll let Simon fill you
in on the details there.

14:39.785 --> 14:41.517
There's some stew on the stove.

14:41.551 --> 14:43.297
Go get yourself something to eat.

14:43.397 --> 14:46.068
It will give you time to
come up with a good story.

14:49.645 --> 14:52.947
- That boy is trouble.
- All boys are trouble.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.416
- I should be off, I suppose.
- Nonsense.

14:59.670 --> 15:01.709
You can stay and have a cup of tea.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.712
If you'll just wait a moment,

15:03.740 --> 15:06.703
- I'll finish this.
- Of course.

15:10.161 --> 15:12.100
The door.

15:13.749 --> 15:16.185
Ladies, you are free to go.

15:16.219 --> 15:19.087
The Crown has dropped all the charges.

15:21.145 --> 15:23.706
Save those against Doctor Grace.

15:26.697 --> 15:28.929
We will fight for you, Emily.

15:30.968 --> 15:33.804
Shame on you, Mr. Garland.

15:36.539 --> 15:39.922
Have a pleasant sleep, Emily.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.851
- And you're still a Constable.
- I am indeed.

15:50.189 --> 15:53.665
A smart man such as yourself? I would
have thought you an Inspector by now.

15:54.113 --> 15:56.335
I'm content with what I do.

15:56.802 --> 16:00.058
When did Miss Garrison become Mrs. Brooks?

16:01.366 --> 16:02.646
I, uh...

16:02.884 --> 16:06.467
I met Archibald about three years ago.

16:06.844 --> 16:09.936
Simon's mother had
passed away in childbirth,

16:10.475 --> 16:13.139
and he was quite lost without her.

16:13.905 --> 16:16.677
He had such an easy smile.

16:18.423 --> 16:20.243
He's dead now.

16:22.283 --> 16:23.765
Sometimes I really...

16:24.149 --> 16:26.317
just wonder what I'm going to do.

16:27.588 --> 16:29.289
I'm so sorry. What happened?

16:29.646 --> 16:31.724
He went overseas.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.579
The Boer War.

16:33.853 --> 16:37.630
He was killed about three months ago.

16:37.969 --> 16:40.576
Simon never mentioned anything to me.

16:40.594 --> 16:43.933
I haven't told him. I
just haven't had the heart.

16:45.196 --> 16:46.654
I do my best to be his mother,

16:46.677 --> 16:48.314
but sometimes I just...

16:49.851 --> 16:52.009
I'm sorry, George Crabtree,

16:53.061 --> 16:54.964
I meant only to share in a cup of tea.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.955
I did not mean to unload my burdens on you.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.994
It's quite alright.

17:00.954 --> 17:04.689
If you need anything, you could call on me.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.290
I'll manage, George.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.848
No doubt there are many others worse off.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.902
Thank you for not throwing my son in jail.

17:18.762 --> 17:20.976
Well, thank you for the tea, Edna.

17:30.735 --> 17:33.452
The missus said you wanted to talk to me.

17:34.202 --> 17:36.177
She's worried,

17:36.707 --> 17:38.445
as am I.

17:39.981 --> 17:41.582
It's a St. George's pin.

17:41.702 --> 17:43.561
Margaret gave it to me.

17:43.595 --> 17:46.411
Why was it found under
Mick O'Shea's dead body?

17:46.987 --> 17:48.432
Mick O'Shea's dead?

17:48.467 --> 17:52.000
So is his brother. We found both of their
bodies in the basement of the Laughing Dog.

17:52.036 --> 17:54.037
- When was this?
- This morning.

17:55.119 --> 17:56.601
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

17:56.628 --> 17:59.709
Sir, why was your pin
found with two dead bodies?

17:59.743 --> 18:01.878
I don't know. Someone took it from me.

18:01.912 --> 18:03.880
I need you to be honest with me.

18:04.174 --> 18:07.256
You nearly killed a dockworker,
threatened Mr. Jeffries,

18:07.293 --> 18:08.510
and now the O'Sheas.

18:08.985 --> 18:11.272
Jeffries sent me to the Laughing Dog.

18:11.392 --> 18:13.103
I didn't see the O'Sheas there.

18:13.119 --> 18:14.857
Dead or alive.

18:15.973 --> 18:17.565
Do you think I've killed them?

18:17.921 --> 18:20.697
I think whoever they were
working for killed them.

18:21.736 --> 18:24.367
Sir, come back to work.

18:24.401 --> 18:26.469
We'll find them together.

18:26.504 --> 18:29.171
We're not solving this
by following the rules.

18:29.206 --> 18:31.467
Whoever the O'Sheas were working for

18:31.495 --> 18:33.376
tried to have me killed.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.400
- Threatened my family.
- Sir.

18:36.068 --> 18:38.180
There are two laws now.

18:38.215 --> 18:40.916
The law that I once upheld
and the law of the jungle.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.951
I know which one I choose.

18:44.954 --> 18:46.651
If you do anything rash,

18:46.852 --> 18:49.679
- I will have to arrest you.
- Of course you will, Detective.

19:19.220 --> 19:22.466
It took a year for the Law
Society to decide that the word

19:22.475 --> 19:25.905
"person" could apply
equally to men and women.

19:27.462 --> 19:30.932
But it finally did, and
I was able to pursue law.

19:31.255 --> 19:33.533
It was not easy,

19:33.653 --> 19:36.862
but then again, you went to medical
school, you know all about tribulation,

19:36.904 --> 19:39.067
as does Dr. Grace.

19:39.707 --> 19:41.942
In your opinion, is
she going to go to jail?

19:42.277 --> 19:43.743
It's likely.

19:44.207 --> 19:46.813
But she was merely defending
Kathleen from an attacker.

19:46.850 --> 19:49.795
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- I have read the police reports,

19:49.804 --> 19:52.356
there is no mention of that incident.

19:52.476 --> 19:55.055
In the eyes of the law,
that attack never occurred.

19:55.089 --> 19:57.285
Well, then the law and justice
are two different things.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.691
That may be. Remember,

19:59.811 --> 20:01.861
women are not supposed to rise up.

20:04.065 --> 20:06.432
But we have been known to be underhanded.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.890
- Ladies. You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.484
Yes, well, before you get
started, I should inform you

20:19.604 --> 20:22.181
that I have no interest
in negotiating a plea.

20:22.216 --> 20:26.242
- Miss Grace is to be prosecuted to the full extent.
- It's Dr. Grace, not Miss Grace.

20:26.362 --> 20:28.199
And your doctor almost killed a man.

20:28.319 --> 20:29.773
I do believe you're overstating.

20:29.782 --> 20:32.937
Your "society" is responsible
for public nuisance,

20:32.959 --> 20:35.360
disturbance, and incitement to riot.

20:35.394 --> 20:37.447
I hardly think I am overstating anything.

20:37.456 --> 20:39.861
Sir, we believe your
assistant Leslie Garland

20:39.861 --> 20:43.601
is pushing for a reckless prosecution
of Dr. Grace for personal reasons.

20:43.638 --> 20:47.020
I set the charges. Not my assistant.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.161
Be that as it may, I believe
he has influenced you.

20:49.198 --> 20:50.634
Miss Martin,

20:50.754 --> 20:52.747
are you going to continue
to allow your client

20:52.793 --> 20:56.150
- to speak to me in this fashion?
- I see no reason not to.

20:57.046 --> 21:00.412
Whether or not Mr. Garland
has animosity toward Dr. Grace

21:00.421 --> 21:02.031
has no bearing on what she did.

21:02.151 --> 21:06.356
Six months ago, Leslie Garland posed
as notorious murderer James Gillies

21:06.393 --> 21:09.347
and threatened the lives of
Detective William Murdoch and myself.

21:09.658 --> 21:11.652
I am willing to lay charges against him

21:11.670 --> 21:13.531
if this matter is not put to rest.

21:17.502 --> 21:19.619
These are very serious allegations.

21:19.655 --> 21:22.640
And ones Detective Murdoch
and I can easily prove.

21:22.674 --> 21:25.061
You have it in your
power to save the office

21:25.098 --> 21:27.732
of the Crown Attorney
significant embarrassment.

21:29.634 --> 21:32.149
Right. Here's what we know.

21:32.183 --> 21:34.976
Mick and Tim O'Shea have
been strong-arming people

21:35.003 --> 21:36.668
down by the Toronto Harbour

21:36.704 --> 21:39.384
for the privilege of keeping
their businesses open.

21:39.504 --> 21:42.658
Mick and Tim O'Shea were likely
responsible for Richard Dawkins' death.

21:42.778 --> 21:45.696
And now Mick and Tim O'Shea are also dead.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.764
- Sounds like someone has done our job for us.
- Yes, it does, Henry,

21:48.799 --> 21:50.835
and I'm not happy about that.

21:50.955 --> 21:54.537
Because it means it's likely that Mick
and Tim O'Shea were not acting alone.

21:54.850 --> 21:56.772
What have you, George?

21:56.807 --> 21:59.423
Sir, I was just looking into
Dawkins' business dealings.

21:59.460 --> 22:03.145
It turns out The Chandlery wasn't the only
business he owned down at the Docklands.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.466
- He also had a warehouse on Polsen Street.
- Polsen?

22:07.270 --> 22:09.530
That's where I was beaten.

22:14.024 --> 22:16.058
The noise came from around here, sir.

22:19.329 --> 22:21.393
George.

22:28.944 --> 22:31.862
Jackson, keep an eye out.

22:42.871 --> 22:45.935
Ugh! My God.

23:15.177 --> 23:18.333
***

23:19.211 --> 23:21.534
And you say there's more
people being held there?

23:21.580 --> 23:23.537
It certainly appeared that way.

23:26.345 --> 23:29.308
Well, if he's the one who did this,
then it's a good thing he's gone.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.961
I share your sentiments.

23:32.711 --> 23:35.504
So who killed Dawkins?

23:35.538 --> 23:38.707
Likely the person who knew he
was holding these women captive.

23:40.710 --> 23:43.367
Tell me about the
warehouse on Polsen Street.

23:43.403 --> 23:45.123
What warehouse?

23:45.123 --> 23:47.638
The warehouse on Polsen
Street that your husband owned.

23:47.647 --> 23:49.842
My husband owned a chandlery down there.

23:49.870 --> 23:51.315
That's the extent of it.

23:51.671 --> 23:54.141
That's not entirely true.

23:56.016 --> 23:58.193
I didn't know about this.

23:58.227 --> 24:00.461
Detective Murdoch, what is this about?

24:00.736 --> 24:04.332
We found evidence that
several people - women -

24:04.366 --> 24:06.634
have been held there against their will.

24:06.669 --> 24:08.803
Chained, possibly tortured.

24:08.837 --> 24:11.547
One of whom we know
for certain is now dead.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.605
And you think my husband...

24:15.142 --> 24:17.007
Oh, my God.

24:18.013 --> 24:20.904
You said your husband
had been acting strangely

24:20.916 --> 24:22.404
prior to his murder.

24:22.632 --> 24:24.434
Yes.

24:25.086 --> 24:28.622
You said that he had been
planning on leaving the docks.

24:28.656 --> 24:30.825
Yes.

24:30.859 --> 24:34.295
You also knew that the
O'Sheas were capable of murder.

24:34.329 --> 24:37.320
Did you discover what your
husband had been doing?

24:37.549 --> 24:40.521
- Did you tell the O'Sheas...
- If I knew my husband was doing this,

24:40.548 --> 24:42.597
I would have gladly had him killed.

24:42.817 --> 24:44.701
But I didn't know.

24:45.323 --> 24:48.734
Oh God, I didn't know.

24:54.781 --> 24:57.047
Feels like a dark cloud has passed.

24:57.075 --> 25:00.119
- Well, you know what they say about the weather.
- What's that?

25:00.154 --> 25:02.388
It's ever changing.

25:02.422 --> 25:04.840
Especially since the death of the O'Sheas.

25:04.849 --> 25:08.194
- You live by the sword.
- Who did it, Mr. Blake?

25:08.229 --> 25:09.615
I don't know.

25:09.735 --> 25:11.755
They died in the basement
of your bloody pub.

25:11.798 --> 25:13.401
- Who did it?
- I don't know.

25:13.429 --> 25:17.161
- Who ran the O'Sheas?
- What does it matter, they're dead.

25:18.194 --> 25:21.440
Whoever they were working
for tried to have me killed.

25:21.641 --> 25:24.367
- Who did it?
- I don't...

25:25.117 --> 25:27.504
I swear I don't know.

25:28.348 --> 25:30.815
Paying off scumbags like that.

25:30.850 --> 25:32.882
You're a bloody coward, son.

25:33.733 --> 25:36.054
A live one.

25:38.343 --> 25:42.059
Take it from me, that's not much of a life.

25:47.966 --> 25:50.334
All rise.

25:54.313 --> 25:55.849
Be seated.

25:58.143 --> 26:00.111
Miss Martin,

26:00.145 --> 26:02.827
have you had ample time
to prepare your defense?

26:02.847 --> 26:03.952
I have.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.416
Your Honour.

26:05.736 --> 26:07.209
Mr. Atkinson.

26:08.077 --> 26:09.696
Based on new information

26:09.721 --> 26:11.889
that the Crown Attorney's
office has just received,

26:12.935 --> 26:14.825
we wish to formally withdraw all charges

26:14.826 --> 26:16.547
- against Dr. Emily Grace.
-  Sir.

26:16.556 --> 26:19.584
Keep your mouth closed, Mr. Garland.

26:20.297 --> 26:22.666
I apologize for wasting the Court's time.

26:24.469 --> 26:26.269
What did you two do?

26:27.560 --> 26:30.173
I trust you have no
objections, Miss Martin?

26:30.207 --> 26:31.969
Of course not, Your Honour.

26:32.089 --> 26:36.130
Well, Dr. Grace, it
appears you are free to go.

26:36.643 --> 26:39.249
- Miss Martin.
- Yes, Your Honour.

26:39.283 --> 26:43.337
It is a shame I did not get a chance
to see you practice your wizardry.

26:43.593 --> 26:46.323
I do hope there will be another time, sir.

26:54.149 --> 26:56.591
Good day, Mr. Garland.

27:06.369 --> 27:09.678
It appears that building hasn't
been in use for quite some time.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.143
Gentlemen.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.905
I'd like to return to
you your city coroner.

27:14.025 --> 27:16.695
- That is very good news.
- Congratulations, Emily, you won.

27:16.722 --> 27:20.161
Not exactly. The Crown
withdrew the charges.

27:20.893 --> 27:24.158
William, I don't suppose
you'd care to celebrate?

27:24.278 --> 27:26.160
Perhaps another time.

27:26.195 --> 27:28.742
- Enjoy yourselves.
- We will.

27:36.539 --> 27:38.506
George?

27:38.540 --> 27:40.468
Who owns this building:

27:40.505 --> 27:41.904
9B?

27:48.882 --> 27:51.050
Richard Dawkins.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.361
Sir, this is it, 9B.

27:59.235 --> 28:00.680
George!

28:12.979 --> 28:15.138
I don't think there's
anything in here, sir.

28:33.175 --> 28:34.794
It's alright. It's alright.

28:34.828 --> 28:36.028
Police.

28:36.796 --> 28:38.817
Police. You're safe.

28:39.723 --> 28:42.234
Come out of there.

28:52.812 --> 28:54.978
It's alright. It's alright. You're safe.

29:10.435 --> 29:13.060
- Any idea who she is yet?
- No, sir.

29:13.087 --> 29:16.310
- She doesn't speak a word of English.
- I see.

29:16.563 --> 29:19.407
Well, let me have a go.
I'm quite a communicator.

29:19.527 --> 29:22.755
Hello. I'm Inspector Hamish Slorach.

29:22.801 --> 29:24.090
Who are you?

29:32.486 --> 29:35.083
Murdoch, this is your lucky day.

29:35.930 --> 29:38.880
Ma, I need you to ask her her name.

29:43.334 --> 29:45.419
Gulyás Zsuzsanna.

29:45.703 --> 29:48.609
- Zsuzsanna.
- Zsuzsanna.

29:48.643 --> 29:50.003
Okay.

29:50.845 --> 29:54.014
Could you ask her how
long she's been in Canada?

29:59.113 --> 30:00.914
Shh, shh.

30:02.323 --> 30:04.509
She has been here three weeks.

30:07.619 --> 30:10.596
Could you ask her if
she's ever seen this man?

30:21.402 --> 30:23.131
What about him?

30:28.418 --> 30:30.512
She knows much more
than what she is saying.

30:30.530 --> 30:32.652
But she is frightened.

30:33.713 --> 30:36.988
Could I trouble you to stay
just a little while longer?

30:37.257 --> 30:38.770
Certainly.

30:38.771 --> 30:42.091
I would like to see how my
Hamish behaves when he's at work.

30:42.430 --> 30:44.314
Ma!

30:52.775 --> 30:54.522
Where is everyone?

30:54.740 --> 30:57.028
I think the arrests scared them all away.

30:57.065 --> 30:59.810
Eileen was beaten by her husband.

30:59.845 --> 31:03.385
Jane was relieved of her duties at Eaton's.

31:04.149 --> 31:05.974
Looks like we've won the battle but

31:06.001 --> 31:08.791
- lost the war.
- No one said this would be easy, Margaret.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.208
So this is it?

31:10.245 --> 31:12.356
This is what's left of
the suffrage society.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.223
I'm afraid so.

31:16.294 --> 31:18.795
- So what do we do?
- We fight on.

31:19.418 --> 31:21.731
- The four of us?
- We have to.

31:21.766 --> 31:23.991
Women have no power in this world.

31:24.009 --> 31:27.173
I've seen it all too clearly and
I don't care to see it anymore.

31:28.143 --> 31:31.741
We are women of intelligence
and privilege, it's our duty.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.997
The four will become more.

31:34.117 --> 31:35.745
I agree with you.

31:36.018 --> 31:38.626
This is a fight that we can win.

31:39.202 --> 31:40.446
Margaret?

31:42.659 --> 31:44.607
Yes.

31:46.171 --> 31:47.724
To the Furious Four.

31:47.758 --> 31:50.095
The Furious Four?

31:50.215 --> 31:51.760
I like it.

32:46.145 --> 32:48.983
- Thank you for coming.
- I'm not sure what I can do.

32:49.017 --> 32:51.752
I'm hoping she sees you
as a woman of authority.

32:51.788 --> 32:54.157
A person she can trust.

32:55.257 --> 32:57.258
Tell her no harm will come to her.

32:57.292 --> 32:59.891
I'm a doctor. My name is Julia.

33:04.967 --> 33:07.116
How did she come to be here?

33:14.809 --> 33:16.409
They came by ship.

33:16.443 --> 33:18.431
And what happened when they arrived?

33:28.727 --> 33:31.636
Once here they were imprisoned.

33:32.450 --> 33:34.694
By these men?

33:39.900 --> 33:42.635
Tell her she's safe.
All these men are dead.

34:05.719 --> 34:10.036
These two men imprisoned her
and a number of her friends.

34:10.447 --> 34:11.838
But not this one.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.864
What did he do?

34:15.011 --> 34:17.435
Mr. Dawkins hid her from the O'Sheas.

34:17.453 --> 34:19.529
She waited for his return
but he never came back.

34:19.574 --> 34:21.772
He saved her.

34:21.806 --> 34:24.342
And the drowned woman
was her friend, Melinka.

34:24.376 --> 34:26.844
Yes, she identified her.

34:26.879 --> 34:30.551
If Dawkins did this, then why
wouldn't he have contacted the police?

34:30.560 --> 34:32.654
Perhaps he intended to.

34:32.774 --> 34:34.784
It may be that he called the dinner

34:34.793 --> 34:37.784
to alert the others of what
the O'Sheas had been up to.

34:38.096 --> 34:40.658
But they got to him first.

34:40.692 --> 34:42.797
Did she say anything about

34:42.806 --> 34:44.708
what happened to the rest of the women?

34:44.754 --> 34:48.399
They've been in Canada for at
least three weeks. Nine of them.

34:48.742 --> 34:50.882
They were being sold, William.

34:51.284 --> 34:53.436
Good lord.

34:56.032 --> 34:59.197
Did she mention where she
thought the others could be now?

34:59.215 --> 35:01.658
She'd heard the word 'Chicago.'

35:11.608 --> 35:13.492
I should've locked the door.

35:14.023 --> 35:15.759
Irish whiskey.

35:18.128 --> 35:20.096
Slightly tastes better than piss.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.647
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

35:22.675 --> 35:24.400
You know very well who I am.

35:24.434 --> 35:26.235
I'm the man you tried to have killed.

35:26.270 --> 35:28.771
Don't tell me you don't remember.

35:29.425 --> 35:31.874
We've got some very
urgent business to discuss.

35:31.909 --> 35:33.609
I hardly think so.

35:34.098 --> 35:35.808
After you.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.915
- We're looking for a ship heading for Chicago.
- What if it's already left?

35:39.950 --> 35:43.482
I've contacted the Chicago Port Authority
and asked them to search any vessel

35:43.500 --> 35:46.062
- coming from Toronto.
- What about the other outgoing vessels?

35:46.071 --> 35:47.736
We're on our way to look now, sir.

35:47.754 --> 35:51.147
Constables, I know I'm asking you
to search for a needle in a haystack,

35:51.157 --> 35:52.442
but this is important.

35:52.474 --> 35:55.664
The lives of seven innocent
women could be at stake here.

35:59.297 --> 36:02.927
Well, this has all been rather enjoyable,

36:03.047 --> 36:04.872
but could you get to the point?

36:04.907 --> 36:07.909
- The point is you're behind all this.
- All what?

36:08.132 --> 36:10.857
The O'Sheas. The extortion. The murders.

36:11.415 --> 36:13.481
You don't really believe that?

36:13.515 --> 36:16.283
- I hardly seem capable...
- Sit down and shut up!

36:20.233 --> 36:23.289
When I was poking around the
docks all those months ago,

36:23.324 --> 36:25.574
you knew that I'd find out something out.

36:25.602 --> 36:27.514
You had to stop that.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.097
It was none of your business.

36:31.131 --> 36:33.700
You sent your thugs to have me killed.

36:33.734 --> 36:36.093
I thought they had killed you.

36:37.538 --> 36:40.319
Damn shame for you that they didn't.

36:42.588 --> 36:44.112
I'm searching for vessels

36:44.134 --> 36:46.009
that are destined to depart for Chicago.

36:46.054 --> 36:48.881
Sir, if they were smuggling
women, would they...

36:48.915 --> 36:51.550
would they be writing it down?

36:55.471 --> 36:56.798
None.

36:58.492 --> 37:02.394
What ships can enter and exit a
harbour without declaring their cargo?

37:04.316 --> 37:06.511
Fishing boats.

37:08.322 --> 37:09.801
Take me to the police.

37:09.835 --> 37:12.371
I am happy to defend myself.

37:12.405 --> 37:14.373
Of course you are.

37:14.407 --> 37:17.587
The only ones that could
speak out against you are dead.

37:17.943 --> 37:20.545
That's why we are now
playing by your rules.

37:20.579 --> 37:23.081
And your rules are an eye for an eye.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.817
You're going to kill me?

37:26.112 --> 37:28.953
An officer of the law?

37:30.756 --> 37:33.257
That's about the size of it.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.365
Sir, put that down immediately.

37:45.404 --> 37:47.497
You're not getting on this ship.

37:48.978 --> 37:50.625
Thank you, George.

37:50.745 --> 37:54.811
- You have no right to be on board.
- We'll be off presently.

37:59.122 --> 38:02.469
I said, get off. Now!

38:09.630 --> 38:11.441
Sir.

38:23.197 --> 38:24.874
George,

38:24.908 --> 38:27.413
see that these women get
some medical attention

38:27.413 --> 38:29.279
and some shelter immediately.

38:34.410 --> 38:35.901
I...

38:40.639 --> 38:43.520
Who's responsible for this?

38:45.825 --> 38:47.380
Well...

38:48.066 --> 38:49.867
what are you waiting for?

38:51.212 --> 38:54.017
Are you afraid that if
you kill me, you'll hang?

38:54.047 --> 38:56.700
That would be a shame if you were to hang.

38:57.140 --> 38:59.274
What would happen to that wife,

38:59.309 --> 39:01.276
and those two children?

39:01.311 --> 39:04.146
All alone in the world...

39:04.180 --> 39:06.615
They'd be safe from the likes of you.

39:08.379 --> 39:12.286
Oh, there's a lot more like me.

39:27.284 --> 39:29.003
Sir?

39:31.657 --> 39:34.053
Inspector, what have you done?

39:34.081 --> 39:35.976
She thought she was above the law.

39:36.011 --> 39:39.238
By my count, there are four
deaths that she's responsible for.

39:40.048 --> 39:42.339
Let's bring her in.

39:43.084 --> 39:45.352
She almost had us both killed, Murdoch.

39:46.015 --> 39:48.347
She sent the O'Sheas after my family.

39:48.567 --> 39:51.058
And she'll be punished.

39:51.092 --> 39:53.393
She will.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.530
You can't do this!

39:57.036 --> 39:58.737
Can you give me one good reason

39:58.747 --> 40:00.594
why she deserves to live?

40:01.372 --> 40:04.037
- Well, can you?
- No, I can't.

40:05.030 --> 40:08.350
- Neither can I.
- No...

40:12.713 --> 40:15.091
No reason except for the law.

40:15.329 --> 40:17.652
And the law trumps the likes of you.

40:39.968 --> 40:42.996
They don't know where they were held.

41:31.736 --> 41:34.041
- Leslie.
- Julia.

41:34.348 --> 41:37.279
I've come to deliver some good news.

41:37.599 --> 41:39.594
I've been fired.

41:40.463 --> 41:42.713
But I suppose you already know that,

41:43.107 --> 41:44.781
don't you?

41:45.329 --> 41:47.314
I didn't know what the
consequences would be.

41:47.323 --> 41:49.417
But I don't imagine you
regret doing what you did.

41:49.445 --> 41:51.347
I most certainly do not.

41:52.006 --> 41:54.776
You've destroyed my good name.

41:55.654 --> 41:59.633
I think you did that all
on your own, Mr. Garland.

42:00.008 --> 42:02.980
You'll be leaving Doctor
Ogden's office now.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.431
And if you ever come back,

42:05.440 --> 42:08.623
I will take this badge off
and I will deal with you.

42:08.641 --> 42:11.586
- Detective, I was simply explaining...
- Did you not hear me?

42:13.159 --> 42:15.885
Goodbye, Mr. Garland.

42:26.899 --> 42:28.873
William!

42:28.993 --> 42:30.757
I must say, that was...

42:30.877 --> 42:32.604
most surprising.

42:32.979 --> 42:36.144
And more than a little impressive.

42:36.355 --> 42:40.488
Sometimes one must employ
the law of the jungle.

42:49.041 --> 42:53.066
- Well, that about does it.
- I'm very grateful, Hamish.

42:53.093 --> 42:56.486
It was always your job, Tommy.
I just did my best to fill in.

42:56.807 --> 42:58.837
Detective Murdoch.

42:58.846 --> 43:00.044
A pleasure.

43:00.164 --> 43:02.916
- I will miss our conversations.
- As will I, sir.

43:02.943 --> 43:06.484
Now quit lollygagging and get yourself
married before I go and steal her from you.

43:06.511 --> 43:09.612
Alright, bye-bye.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.596
- It's good to have you back, Inspector.
- Thank you, Murdoch.

43:14.716 --> 43:17.450
- Crabtree!
- Put the bloody kettle on?

43:17.789 --> 43:19.435
Exactly.

43:19.810 --> 43:21.283
All new Murdoch...

43:21.328 --> 43:23.825
- Who are you?
- Bat Masterson.

43:23.870 --> 43:25.590
Are you saying... Damn right.

43:25.626 --> 43:28.690
Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid are in Toronto.

43:28.810 --> 43:31.572
He's permitted our wedding
to take place in the church.

43:31.572 --> 43:32.898
Murdoch Mysteries,

43:32.916 --> 43:35.057
next Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
