01:19.497 --> 01:22.750
Time for something sweet.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.881
Now, boys. Don't crowd.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.467
There's plenty for everyone.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.053
Ooh.

01:36.973 --> 01:39.642
I could have some laughs
with this.

01:42.812 --> 01:44.188
Nasty.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.399
Drop it, clown!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.443
The Batfreak!

01:50.319 --> 01:51.319
Smoke him!

02:10.589 --> 02:12.258
Jeez, what do I tell my suppliers?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.266
Say you had a fire sale.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.393
That's one arms shipment
that” never reach the streets.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.578
- Good work.
- Thanks.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.997
These late nights
too much for you?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.207
The nights aren't tough,
it's the mornings.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.257
Mr. McGinnis, I see that gravity's
gotten the better of you.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.425
Huh?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
I'm sorry that my tests
aren't more stimulating.

02:56.761 --> 03:00.431
Perhaps this failure to perform file
will capture your attention.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.350
Take it home
and have your mother scan it.

03:02.433 --> 03:03.851
But...

03:03.934 --> 03:04.935
Class dismissed!

03:06.937 --> 03:08.814
- Great.
- Cheer up, Ter!

03:08.898 --> 03:10.858
There's more to life
than vectors and vertices.

03:10.941 --> 03:11.941
Like what?

03:11.984 --> 03:13.944
Like the big game after school.

03:14.028 --> 03:16.113
Oh, I don't know, Dana.
Maybe I better pass.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.784
Don't be such a spud. You need
some excitement in your life.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.015
- How lame!
- Huh?

03:43.099 --> 03:44.392
Did you see that?

03:44.475 --> 03:47.311
Mason, what kind of a
bonehead pass was that?

03:47.395 --> 03:49.772
- I'm sorry, Coach.
- You sure are!

03:49.855 --> 03:52.209
In fact, you're the sorriest
bunch of losers I've ever seen!

03:52.233 --> 03:54.169
I don't care what it takes,
I want you to get out there

03:54.193 --> 03:55.736
and kick butt, understand?

03:55.820 --> 03:57.029
Yes, Coach!

04:30.146 --> 04:31.146
Look out!

04:35.901 --> 04:37.820
Get him off of there!

04:38.154 --> 04:40.322
Quit whining!
It was a legal check!

04:40.406 --> 04:41.574
Nice hit, kid.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.210
Wasn't that a great game?

04:53.377 --> 04:55.045
I mean, the part
you stayed awake for.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.881
It wasn't you. Honest.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.425
I'm just seriously REM-deprived.

04:59.842 --> 05:01.051
See ya tomorrow.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.641
What now?

05:07.725 --> 05:09.810
I've been testing
the new sky cam,

05:09.894 --> 05:12.438
and picked up something
at Vid-City Electronics.

05:12.605 --> 05:14.148
<i>What?</i>

05:14.356 --> 05:15.608
Late shoppers.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.154
Hurry, grab the goggles!

05:23.866 --> 05:26.327
<i>Hey,
it's the special Swimsuit Edition.</i>

05:26.744 --> 05:27.870
<i>Schwa y.</i>

05:34.043 --> 05:35.419
Look, I'm on the big screen!

05:39.548 --> 05:41.675
Five hundred channels
and nothing good on 'em.

05:41.759 --> 05:42.759
Run!

05:46.639 --> 05:48.557
- Mason, wait!
- Mason?

06:10.538 --> 06:12.206
- It's over, Mason.
- No!

06:23.676 --> 06:25.469
I'm rippin'!

06:30.808 --> 06:33.227
Slammin', Mas!

06:39.775 --> 06:40.901
<i>What happened?</i>

06:40.985 --> 06:43.279
Guess I underestimated
how strong they were.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.990
<i>- Any idea who they were?
- Yeah.</i>

06:46.073 --> 06:48.158
I know one of them.
A jock named...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.743
Mason!

06:50.244 --> 06:52.496
Mason, wait up!
I didn't see you after the game.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.956
- Where did you 90?
- Out.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.874
- Out where?
- Guy stuff.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.627
- You don't look so good.
- I'm fine.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.963
Aw, Mas, you're not using Sla...

07:01.046 --> 07:02.715
I don't have time for this, Chelsea!

07:03.966 --> 07:06.927
You're right, Mason.
None of us do.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.388
Chelsea. Chelsea!

07:09.471 --> 07:12.808
Hey, Mas! We've been looking
all over for you.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.727
- Did you unload the stuff?
- Here's the cash.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.770
- Got top dollar.
- Good.

07:16.854 --> 07:19.565
I'll meet you at the gym.
Sometime tonight. I'll let you know.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.614
What?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.325
Uh, you don't look so good.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.103
Yes.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.756
Jackpot.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.639
Looks like I got a rodent problem.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.063
I don't know why you're poking
your nose in my gym.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.898
And frankly, I don't care!

08:53.033 --> 08:55.285
I eat punks like you
for breakfast!

09:09.425 --> 09:10.843
Sorry to spoil your appetite.

09:19.518 --> 09:20.978
Boy, are you in trouble.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.313
- Terry, is that you?
- Yeah, Mom.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.190
Do you know what time it is?

09:25.274 --> 09:27.901
I had to run some errands
for Mr. Wayne. I'm beat.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.737
I got a call
from your school today.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.500
They said you were sleeping
in class again.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.615
Ooh, busted.

09:33.991 --> 09:36.869
- What's going on, Terry?
- Nothing. I've just been busy.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.747
Yeah. Busy with Dana.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.166
Your teacher said he sent
home another demerit file.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.002
- I'll get it.
- Hey, out of my stuff, twip!

09:49.006 --> 09:50.674
- What are those?
- Nothing.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.968
Don't lie to me.
They're Slappers, aren't they?

09:53.051 --> 09:55.721
- I've seen them on the news.
- Mom, it's not what you think.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.141
The lies, the poor grades,
the unexplained absences.

09:59.224 --> 10:00.452
It's because of these, isn't it?

10:00.476 --> 10:02.436
No, they're not even mine!

10:02.519 --> 10:03.729
Then where did they come from?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.814
I found them,
in the locker room.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.066
- At school.
- Yeah, right.

10:08.150 --> 10:11.278
Jeez, Matt.
Mom, you gotta believe me!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.781
I don't wanna hear any more.
You're grounded!

10:18.744 --> 10:21.121
So, she'll let me out to work
for you and go to school.

10:21.205 --> 10:23.332
Otherwise, I'm in solitary,
big time.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.959
At least
you managed to keep one of these.

10:26.043 --> 10:29.254
Barely. I got a real problem here.
She doesn't trust me anymore.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.548
And nothing I say
is gonna change her mind.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.445
You got any ideas
on how to play this?

10:33.509 --> 10:35.886
Arch criminals, I know how to handle.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.471
Mothers are something else.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.853
- What is it?
- Venom.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.147
A highly addictive steroidal compound.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.525
Only one man has the formula.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.029
- Bane.
- I've heard of him.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.781
You're going to meet him as well.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.033
Sure. As long as I'm home by 9:00.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.702
I told you I was in trouble.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.175
Are you sure this is the place?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.593
<i>He's there, all right.</i>

11:16.677 --> 11:17.928
<i>It's been 20 years</i>

11:18.011 --> 11:20.055
<i>since he left prison,
but I've made it my business</i>

11:20.138 --> 11:21.765
<i>to keep track of his whereabouts.</i>

11:21.849 --> 11:24.810
Remember,
he was a formidable opponent.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.478
- Be careful.
- Come on.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.146
He must be a zillion years old.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.731
What trouble could an old geezer...

11:31.441 --> 11:32.943
Never mind.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.987
- Where's Bane?
- In there.

12:36.048 --> 12:37.049
Bane!

12:45.265 --> 12:48.518
- What happened to him?
- Too many years on Venom.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.042
That's what that stuff'II do to you.

12:58.779 --> 13:00.280
<i>It was a dead end?</i>

13:00.405 --> 13:03.033
Yeah, but if Bane
isn't making the Venom...

13:03.116 --> 13:04.326
then who is?

13:18.256 --> 13:21.510
Wake up, Mason. My grandmother
can hit harder than that!

13:24.471 --> 13:27.057
- I don't feel so good.
- Can we take five, Coach?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.476
Am I working you ladies too hard?

13:29.810 --> 13:32.604
Tough! Cut it out
or hit the showers!

13:39.069 --> 13:41.989
Oh, I can't even get through
practice without a Slapper.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.991
Yeah. It'd be nice to have one.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.618
It wasn't my fault!
I don't know who took 'em!

13:46.702 --> 13:48.620
You're supposed to be in charge!

13:48.704 --> 13:52.124
Hey, don't break a sweat.
Look what I found at home.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.933
- You got 'em?
- Not this time!

14:14.146 --> 14:15.272
Batman!

14:17.816 --> 14:19.484
No! Wait! Come back!

14:52.267 --> 14:53.477
That must be the hideout.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.356
The old Gotham Herald building?
It's been abandoned for years.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.567
Sure.
Who reads newspapers anymore?

15:16.708 --> 15:17.834
You're back early, boss.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.003
No deliveries tonight,
thanks to Batman.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.632
Somebody mentioned my name?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.010
You. I should've known.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.604
How'd you con
the formula out of Bane?

15:37.687 --> 15:40.315
In the end, he needed Venom
just to keep going.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.276
It got so bad, he couldn't
even make it himself.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.945
He had to trust someone.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.656
And now you're cashing in
by selling poison to kids?

15:47.739 --> 15:48.739
That's right.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.285
You want me, slappy?
I'm right here.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.207
I'll kill you!

18:18.974 --> 18:19.974
<i>Terry?</i>

18:21.726 --> 18:24.020
- I'm okay.
<i>- What about Bane's friend?</i>

18:35.740 --> 18:36.908
It's the Venom.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.202
I think he had too much of a bad thing.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.049
He's late, isn't he?
What are you gonna do to him?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.677
Not as much as I'll do to you
if you don't get back in bed.

18:57.345 --> 18:59.556
Hi! I know, I'm late,
but you're not gonna be mad.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.724
Oh, no?

19:00.849 --> 19:03.101
My fault entirely, Mrs. McGinnis.

19:03.435 --> 19:06.521
I thought we'd drop by the clinic
and get those test results tonight.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.735
He's clean.
You told the truth.

19:12.152 --> 19:13.987
This is such a relief.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.031
Didn't mean to scare you, Mom.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.742
<i>Tonight</i> we have
a real sports round up for you <i>folks.</i>

19:18.992 --> 19:20.785
<i>Three Hamilton Hill
High School athletes</i>

19:20.869 --> 19:23.747
<i>were arrested last night,
charged with using Slappers.</i>

19:23.997 --> 19:26.708
<i>Although their coach denies any
involvement, he's been given</i>

19:26.791 --> 19:29.169
<i>a time out from teaching,
pending an investigation.</i>

19:29.294 --> 19:32.547
I don't believe it. Why would
he allow that to go on?

19:32.922 --> 19:34.632
He wanted to win at any cost.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.636
So he looked the other way.
Right, Terry?

19:42.307 --> 19:43.683
Terry!

19:43.767 --> 19:46.603
It's all right.
He's had a busy night.
