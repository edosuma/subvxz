- And he's hit his head
and he's not moving.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.368
<i>Okay, alright.</i>

16:10.370 --> 16:11.636
<i>Do you think that maybe</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:12.958
<i>he could have been hit by a car?</i>

16:15.441 --> 16:18.443
- Uh... no. I don't know.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.411
<i>Okay. Alright.</i>

16:20.413 --> 16:22.480
- I mean... there's
a possibility,

16:22.482 --> 16:24.182
but he may have just
fallen off his bike.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.150
I don't know.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.618
<i>Okay, but he's lying
on the road with the bike,</i>

16:27.620 --> 16:29.988
<i>and you can't see
anything else around?</i>

16:32.424 --> 16:34.359
- Um, hold on a sec.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.361
Hold on.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.362
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Yep.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.569
Someone's just arrived.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.337
Um...

16:46.339 --> 16:47.438
<i>Someone's just arrived?
Like a vehicle?</i>

16:47.440 --> 16:48.706
- Yeah, like a truck.
Hold on.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.041
Hey, mate, can you...

16:51.610 --> 16:55.179
Can you make sure
that no-one drives past here

16:55.181 --> 16:56.714
or make sure
they're in that Lane.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.383
- Hurry up! I'm a cop, alright.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.184
- Keep the lights flashing.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.319
- Is he alright?

17:01.321 --> 17:02.321
- Yeah, yeah.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.722
Um, hold... what? Yeah.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.425
Sorry, I'm trying to do
two things at once. What?

17:07.426 --> 17:09.160
<i>That's okay.</i>

17:09.162 --> 17:10.962
<i>How about you put the phone
on speakerphone?</i>

17:14.098 --> 17:15.566
- Yeah. Can you hear me?

17:15.568 --> 17:16.701
<i>Yeah, I can hear you.</i>

17:16.703 --> 17:18.169
<i>Now, is there anything around</i>

17:18.171 --> 17:20.070
<i>that you can keep him warm with?</i>

17:20.073 --> 17:21.806
<i>Like, a jacket, a blanket?</i>

17:21.808 --> 17:24.776
- Oh, yeah, well, I can get
something from my car.

17:24.778 --> 17:25.778
<i>Okay, that'd be great.</i>

17:25.779 --> 17:27.545
<i>Is there someone</i>

17:27.547 --> 17:30.248
- yeah, there's a guy here.
Hold on. I'll go now.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.749
Mate, could you sit with him
for a minute?

17:31.751 --> 17:34.385
- I don't know anything
about first aid.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.653
- Just make sure
he doesn't move.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.555
Like, maybe cradle his head.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.223
I'm just getting something
from my car.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.591
Yell out if anything happens.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.482
Here it is.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.457
Just here.

18:17.529 --> 18:21.232
<i>He still hasn't moved,
but he's still breathing.</i>

18:21.234 --> 18:22.400
<i>I'll just move you
out of the way for a sec.</i>

18:22.402 --> 18:24.168
<i>- Sorry.
- Ya.</i>

18:24.170 --> 18:25.269
<i>What's happened to him?</i>

18:27.206 --> 18:31.642
<i>I think he's just had
a head injury, I... I guess.</i>

18:31.644 --> 18:33.644
<i>Were you actually
involved in the incident?</i>

18:38.717 --> 18:42.587
- Alright, just ask them why
a model citizen on the dole

18:42.589 --> 18:44.589
would want to buy
three mobile phones.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.591
Just ask them that, alright?

18:46.593 --> 18:47.859
<i>It's a good question.</i>

18:54.266 --> 18:56.501
- Yeah, well, there is method
in all this.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.904
Yeah, but just... just tell me
that the intercepts hold.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.539
<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

19:04.343 --> 19:07.879
- City west 102, we're
a detective unit in the area...

19:07.881 --> 19:09.847
- Hold on. What are you doing?
What is this?

19:09.849 --> 19:13.217
<i>Copy that,
102. Your eta in progress?</i>

19:13.219 --> 19:14.852
- Yeah, city west 102.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.420
<i>Eta, three to five minutes.</i>
- That's not us.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.656
<i>Carl, I'm gonna go now.</i>

19:21.426 --> 19:22.493
- That's traffic.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.667
Woman on radio:

19:29.669 --> 19:32.270
<i>Gentleman in the white shirt
found him.</i>

19:32.272 --> 19:34.172
<i>Thanks, ultimo 1.</i>

19:34.174 --> 19:36.941
<i>If you could attend outside
the east ocean restaurant.</i>

19:36.943 --> 19:39.443
<i>Sussex street at haymarket...</i>

19:53.725 --> 19:55.326
Detective constable Jim melic.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.928
This is detective sergeant
Carl summer.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.796
- Sir.
- What's going on?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.331
- We've got a kid
in critical condition,

20:00.333 --> 20:03.467
no perpetrator,
one possible witness.

20:03.469 --> 20:05.369
<i>We've got a bystander
who's ID'd the kid.</i>

20:05.371 --> 20:06.871
He lives about five blocks away.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.806
We're trying to get in touch
with the family.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.608
- Who's the witness?

20:10.610 --> 20:11.676
<i>There's no witness.</i>

20:11.678 --> 20:13.477
<i>The guy found the kid.</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:14.879
<i>Wha...</i>

20:14.881 --> 20:15.980
<i>He's a detective?</i>

20:15.982 --> 20:17.715
<i>That's the guy, yeah.</i>

20:17.717 --> 20:19.350
- Yeah, well, wait on a minute.
I don't understand.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.285
Is this his scene or what?

20:21.287 --> 20:24.789
Um... look, I was told
that he's the witness,

20:24.791 --> 20:26.290
he's the one that found the kid.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.226
- Just get your guy back here.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.660
- Constable?

20:29.662 --> 20:30.662
<i>Yep?</i>

20:32.564 --> 20:37.468
- Sir, I just, um...
I just wanted to say I, um...

20:37.470 --> 20:42.240
I trained with Liam.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.942
He was a great, great guy.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.844
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.449
- He's...
He's a detective.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.883
Off duty.
He was just driving.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.886
- So, what, he's a witness?
A suspect?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.688
What, first on the scene?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.770
- I've literally just barely
started speaking to him.

21:08.634 --> 21:09.634
<i>Hey, Carl.</i>

21:11.303 --> 21:12.470
- Hi, mal.
This is Jim.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.305
<i>Jim melic.
How are you?</i>

21:14.307 --> 21:16.440
- Yeah, yeah.
We were introduced.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.609
- That's right.
- Yeah, he's over from mosman.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.810
- That's right.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.612
- Yeah.
- So, what, what is it?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.947
Fallen, you think?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.483
<i>Or maybe a fail
to stop, you reckon?</i>

21:25.485 --> 21:28.786
<i>Uh, well...
It could be a fail to stop.</i>

21:28.788 --> 21:30.588
<i>What, you didn't see
anything, or...?</i>

21:30.590 --> 21:33.758
- Jim, go and help those boys
out with the perimeter,

21:33.760 --> 21:35.660
will you?
Make it your scene.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.695
- Uh...
- I'll handle stuff here.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.730
Just open a wider perimeter.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.299
Bloody rubberneckers.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.533
Righto. Copy that.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.337
- Come on, folks.
You know the drill.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.639
<i>Don't set up there.
This is a stupid spot to park.</i>

21:48.641 --> 21:51.876
- So, I, uh... heard
you took a shot yesterday.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.478
- Oh, yeah.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.947
- Yeah, a very lucky one.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.816
- Up too bloody early anyway,
aren't you?

22:05.023 --> 22:06.924
- Don't worry, we'll have you
out of here in a minute,

22:06.926 --> 22:08.359
<i>so just, uh...</i>

22:08.361 --> 22:09.527
You know what?

22:09.529 --> 22:10.795
- Actually, you guys
can piss off.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.730
Get down there
beyond the truck, alright?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.665
Take a hike.
Let's go. Come on.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.768
Hey, I want tape up here,

22:17.770 --> 22:19.003
across the road
in front of the van.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.671
No-one gets through, alright.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.006
Who's on traffic?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.476
Fucking hell.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.774
- Constable, come here.

22:56.776 --> 22:57.776
- Yes, sir.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.711
<i>So, constable,</i>

23:00.713 --> 23:03.814
<i>detective toohey's obviously
a colleague of mine,</i>

23:03.816 --> 23:06.584
and with all due respect,
detective, I believe you.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.619
<i>I know you to be
an upright citizen,</i>

23:08.621 --> 23:09.987
for the most part, anyway.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.624
<i>So I'd like you to be present
for the witness statement</i>

23:13.626 --> 23:15.659
if you would, for posterity,
whatever that means.

23:15.661 --> 23:16.927
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

23:16.929 --> 23:20.464
- It's your call, constable.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.799
You stay and do this.

23:21.801 --> 23:23.934
I'll oversee the forensics,
alright?

23:23.936 --> 23:25.069
- Yes, sir.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.439
Quite a character.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.541
- Yeah, yeah.

23:30.543 --> 23:34.779
- So run me through
what you saw.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.014
- Uh, so I was driving up
around the bend,

23:37.016 --> 23:39.817
I was traveling north
on my way home,

23:41.853 --> 23:43.754
and... oh, well I saw the...
I saw the kid,

23:43.756 --> 23:45.489
but I thought he was a shape

23:45.491 --> 23:47.191
or I don't know what

23:47.193 --> 23:48.959
on the road.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.061
And I was just sort of stopped
here, and then there's,

23:51.063 --> 23:55.065
in the middle Lane,
a car stopped,

23:55.067 --> 23:59.603
just sort of idling with,
like, brake lights on.

23:59.605 --> 24:03.774
But when I stopped,
he... he just took off.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.643
That's when I came back

24:05.645 --> 24:08.479
and then I made the call
to emergency.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.014
That was about 15 minutes ago.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.553
<i>Ready in one, two, three.</i>

24:39.478 --> 24:42.680
- Has there been any word
on the kid?

24:42.682 --> 24:45.916
- Well, they won't know until
they get him to the hospital.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.623
<i>Excuse me, officer?
What is going on?</i>

24:52.625 --> 24:54.925
- There's been an accident
just across the road.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.096
<i>Do you know his name?</i>

24:59.098 --> 25:00.664
<i>He's in the ambulance?</i>

25:00.666 --> 25:02.233
- Yes, ma'am.

25:02.235 --> 25:05.102
- Can you get one of these guys
to take me to a hospital?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.670
- Please wait.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.640
<i>No, I need to go
to the hospital.</i>

25:09.642 --> 25:12.843
<i>I need... no, I need to go now.
I need to go now.</i>

25:12.845 --> 25:16.547
<i>No. Please,
take me to the hospital.</i>

25:16.549 --> 25:20.050
<i>No, I need to go now.
I need to go now.</i>

25:25.257 --> 25:28.292
- I think we're just about
done here, mate.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.064
- Uh-huh.

26:40.066 --> 26:42.700
Yeah, look, I just can't
actually hear.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.002
I've got the bloody
vacuum cleaner behind me.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.004
What was that?

26:46.005 --> 26:47.005
Oh, okay.

26:48.206 --> 26:50.174
Yep, no worries.
Alright.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.610
Cheers, mate.
Thank you.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.345
- You want to sign this?

26:54.347 --> 26:57.982
It's the statement
for the possible fail to stop.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.624
Yeah, it's right down there
at the bottom.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.258
- Mm-hm.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.661
<i>Hey, I'm looking at this file</i>

27:10.663 --> 27:15.366
<i>and I'm just curious what got
you so into this Victor bloke.</i>

27:15.368 --> 27:19.036
I mean, you've got virtually
nothing on him, aside from...

27:19.038 --> 27:20.337
<i>Well, he's on
the offenders register...</i>

27:20.339 --> 27:21.672
- He did it.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.674
<i>Well, yeah, but...</i>

27:22.675 --> 27:23.675
- Well, watch the tape.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.644
- That's a disc.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.113
- The disc.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.347
Watch it.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.682
<i>I've watched the disc.</i>

27:31.684 --> 27:32.684
- Watch it again.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.085
- Got it.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.820
- I've got a date
with my mother.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.656
Now, the file for the telephone
intercept should be up.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.190
Listen to every word.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.026
If the footnote says,
'nothing of interest, '

27:42.028 --> 27:44.294
take it with a large pinch
of sodium chloride.

27:44.296 --> 27:45.963
<i>Find something.</i>

27:45.965 --> 27:47.364
<i>If you look hard enough,
you always will.</i>

27:47.366 --> 27:48.799
That's the way
you're gonna impress me,

27:48.801 --> 27:50.834
not by bringing me
cups of coffee.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.370
- The intercepts hold.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.806
- Right. We're stirring
the pot good now.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.349
- Yeah.

28:07.218 --> 28:09.019
Uh, yeah. Cheers.

28:20.331 --> 28:23.333
Together...

28:29.307 --> 28:31.375
Bitch again,

28:31.377 --> 28:32.443
dog...

29:03.041 --> 29:04.508
- Sorry.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.043
Hey!

29:06.045 --> 29:07.245
- Hey, nice of you to join us!

29:09.447 --> 29:11.081
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi!

29:11.083 --> 29:12.516
- That was awesome, mum.

29:12.518 --> 29:15.119
- Thank you, darling.
- Honestly, I'm stuffed.

29:27.999 --> 29:31.001
<i>Young William</i>
<i>is in a critical condition</i>,

29:31.003 --> 29:34.104
<i>and it may never be known
what caused his injuries.</i>

29:34.106 --> 29:36.406
<i>Police are appealing
to anyone...</i>

30:00.265 --> 30:01.832
- Babe?

30:03.469 --> 30:04.868
We're cutting the cake soon.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.882
You know, if you're not
gonna tell me things,

30:18.884 --> 30:21.084
then can you tell your friends
not to either?

30:27.992 --> 30:29.359
You were shot at.

30:36.135 --> 30:37.568
Red cordial is like crack.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.912
<i>Oh-hh!</i>

31:13.071 --> 31:14.137
- Dad.

31:14.139 --> 31:15.405
- Hey, mal.
How are you?

31:15.407 --> 31:17.507
- How are you going, Brendan?
- Good, mate.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.950
- Sleepy.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.585
- Jemma, how are you?

31:28.587 --> 31:29.586
- I'm good. How are you doing?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.255
- Yeah, good.
Real good.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.659
<i>Need a beer?</i>

31:35.661 --> 31:39.329
- Oh, God.
How'd you pull up?

31:39.331 --> 31:41.531
- How do I look
like I pulled up?

31:41.533 --> 31:43.033
- Hideous.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.635
- Yeah, thanks.
It's how I feel.

31:44.637 --> 31:47.604
- So, mal,
are they sidelining you?

31:47.606 --> 31:49.072
- Uh, I don't know.

31:53.678 --> 31:56.613
- Does your wife
actually know you're a cop?

32:21.005 --> 32:23.173
- I'm sorry.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.175
- It's fine.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.609
- Hi, um...

32:27.412 --> 32:30.380
- What is...?
- I'm a detective.

32:30.382 --> 32:33.350
I was called to the accident
this morning.

32:33.352 --> 32:34.718
I just dropped by
to see how you're doing,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.186
but I should probably take off.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.188
- Come in.

32:39.023 --> 32:40.023
- Please.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.695
- Okay.

32:48.032 --> 32:54.738
- This is my boy, William.
My cheeky boy.

32:54.740 --> 32:59.443
If you could see him,
he's so cheeky.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.712
I almost expect him
to jump off the bed

33:01.714 --> 33:03.747
and say he's been
playing a trick on me.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.122
- I'm Jim, by the way.

33:14.158 --> 33:15.258
- My name's ankhila.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.169
- Yeah.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.305
Well, I just...
I just dropped by

33:28.307 --> 33:31.274
to see if there's
anything we can do,

33:31.276 --> 33:34.044
I can do,
anything you need.

33:34.046 --> 33:36.747
- Thank you.
Very kind.

33:38.716 --> 33:41.284
There's only one thing
that I need.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.530
Would you get that, Carl?

33:54.032 --> 33:55.165
- Jim.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.266
<i>G'day, sir.</i>

33:56.268 --> 33:58.168
<i>Could I have a word?</i>

33:58.170 --> 34:00.103
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come in.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.478
Did you get anywhere?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.313
- Uh, no. Not yet, no.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.581
Still got a little more
to get through, though, so...

34:12.583 --> 34:16.219
- Oh, right.
Come into the den.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.590
Want to take a pew?

34:20.592 --> 34:21.725
- No, that's alright, mate.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.327
I won't hang around.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.730
- So what's up?

34:26.732 --> 34:31.168
- Um, well, something's kind of
been playing on my mind

34:31.170 --> 34:34.170
and I just wondered
if I could run it past you.

34:34.172 --> 34:36.139
- Yeah, well, you won't
grow hair on your palms,

34:36.141 --> 34:38.074
<i>no matter
what anybody tells you.</i>

34:39.344 --> 34:43.179
- Um, this morning,
the hit-and-run,

34:43.181 --> 34:44.848
one of our detectives
was at the scene.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.117
<i>Detective toohey, was it?</i>

34:47.119 --> 34:49.319
- Mal.
<i>- Mal. Yeah.</i>

34:49.321 --> 34:53.123
Well... I...

34:53.125 --> 34:57.327
It's usually
in a case like that,

34:57.329 --> 35:00.864
normally, wouldn't we run
a full forensic on the vehicle?

35:00.866 --> 35:02.132
Take the vehicle in...

35:02.134 --> 35:03.433
<i>Well, yeah, yeah.</i>

35:03.435 --> 35:05.469
Well, that's exactly
what we did.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.270
<i>Well, yeah,
but a thorough forensic.</i>

35:07.272 --> 35:08.872
- Forensics had a good look
at the commodore.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.474
I made sure of it.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.741
- They had a quick look at it.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.844
- Jim, has this
just occurred to you

35:13.846 --> 35:15.745
or was this
on your mind earlier?

35:15.747 --> 35:17.714
- Yeah, it was kind of
on my mind earlier, yeah.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.851
- Well, why didn't you
bring it up?

35:20.853 --> 35:22.786
- You're my superior.
I didn't want to...

35:22.788 --> 35:24.588
- You thought we skipped a beat?

35:24.590 --> 35:25.889
<i>No, not at all. No.</i>

35:25.891 --> 35:28.425
I just...
I don't know, you know.

35:28.427 --> 35:30.227
I just wasn't sure,
that's the thing,

35:30.229 --> 35:35.432
why the full forensic
wasn't done on his car.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.368
- He's one of us,
and he's made a statement.

35:38.370 --> 35:40.504
- Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.539
<i>When I sent you
away at the scene,</i>

35:42.541 --> 35:43.541
<i>I did it for a reason.</i>

35:43.542 --> 35:45.275
<i>I did it so, you know,</i>

35:45.277 --> 35:49.846
I could ask mal if he had,
you know, anything to say.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.481
You know,
to give him the respect

35:51.483 --> 35:52.916
of not being treated like
a criminal in public

35:52.918 --> 35:55.685
if he had anything to hide.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.853
- So you just asked him?

35:56.855 --> 35:58.588
<i>Too right.</i>

35:58.590 --> 36:01.892
And there is no doubt that he
was clear and direct with me.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.426
- Of course, yeah.

36:03.428 --> 36:04.428
<i>Because...</i>

36:04.429 --> 36:07.264
- No, no, sorry, Carl.
Sorry.

36:07.266 --> 36:10.333
I didn't mean to come in here
and be a pest.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.636
I'll... I'll get out
of your hair, mate. Sorry.

36:12.638 --> 36:16.573
- No, no, no. Come this way.
It's a shortcut.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.910
No, you didn't do anything
wrong, Jim.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.946
<i>I had the same feeling myself
at the scene.</i>

36:22.948 --> 36:24.714
No, the only thing you did wrong

36:24.716 --> 36:27.217
was taking such a long time
before bringing it to me.

36:27.219 --> 36:29.452
But, you know, it takes a while
working with new people

36:29.454 --> 36:33.323
to start seeing
with the same eyes.

36:34.459 --> 36:37.460
- Yes, sir.
- Yes. Alright.

36:37.462 --> 36:38.728
See you later.
- Okay.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.504
- A spotty dog, is it?

36:47.506 --> 36:52.209
- "They came to a yard
full of dinghies and yachts,

36:52.211 --> 36:54.311
"and round they went."

36:56.514 --> 36:58.348
- Oh, why did you do that?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.417
- "Except bottomley potts..."

37:00.419 --> 37:03.220
- Didn't you know, the last one,
I saw hairy...

37:03.222 --> 37:05.455
- He stuck? He stuck?

37:05.457 --> 37:06.523
- Yeah, he's stuck.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.591
- He can't move.

37:10.828 --> 37:12.596
<i>They asleep?</i>

37:12.598 --> 37:17.701
- Yeah, finally.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.353
- You fancy a quickie?

37:36.355 --> 37:37.487
- Hmm?

37:37.489 --> 37:38.922
- Hmm?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.657
We only have, you know,
today and tomorrow

37:40.659 --> 37:42.492
and then we miss the boat
for another month.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.344
Let's go.

38:04.348 --> 38:05.448
- Okay.

39:13.651 --> 39:16.686
<i>...It's one, two, goal!</i>

39:16.688 --> 39:19.589
<i>What a wonderful strike by...</i>

39:20.624 --> 39:22.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.629
- I just spoke to jemma.
Little boy's in a coma.

39:26.631 --> 39:28.732
I'd say it's induced
because of the head injuries,

39:28.734 --> 39:30.900
which is not as bad
as it sounds.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.837
His name's William sarduka.
The details are all there.

39:33.839 --> 39:35.638
The mother's there
most of the time, so...

39:35.640 --> 39:37.974
Come on, guys.
Let's go. Ready?

39:37.976 --> 39:39.075
- Bye, daddy.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.378
- Yeah, say bye.
Say bye, babe.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.679
"Love you, daddy."

39:42.681 --> 39:44.381
- Bye, dad.
<i>- Bye. See you</i>.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.617
<i>I can open it.</i>

40:03.567 --> 40:07.036
- Detective toohey,
Nick jemanus, the day report.

40:07.038 --> 40:08.872
We're doing a story on
the recent spate of hit-and-runs

40:08.874 --> 40:10.540
in the area
where Asian and African...

40:10.542 --> 40:12.509
I'm not authorized to talk.

40:12.511 --> 40:13.977
Could we have a word with you?

40:13.979 --> 40:15.712
- You have media liaison, mate.
You know the story.

40:15.714 --> 40:18.014
- What's it feel like
to be a hero?

40:32.496 --> 40:34.197
<i>You were
in pursuit of a suspect.</i>

40:34.199 --> 40:35.799
<i>Shots fired?</i>

40:35.801 --> 40:37.467
- Two shots.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.936
Am I gonna have to take time out
over all this stuff?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.571
- Not necessarily.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.773
I mean, you didn't
discharge your weapon.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.775
- Mmm.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.778
- But in 2006...

40:48.780 --> 40:50.814
- Mmm.

40:50.816 --> 40:54.484
- ...discharged your weapon.

40:54.486 --> 40:55.885
- By accident.
- By accident.

40:59.890 --> 41:00.890
- Where?

41:03.928 --> 41:05.161
- In the elevator.

41:07.865 --> 41:12.202
I was dicking around and...
It was dumb.

41:12.204 --> 41:13.204
So...

41:16.207 --> 41:17.941
It was 2006.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.913
- You look tired.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.015
- I'm tired.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.650
- You sleeping?

41:27.652 --> 41:30.053
- Yeah. It's just been
a big couple of days.

41:30.055 --> 41:35.825
I took a sleeping pill,
so I'm a little bit foggy today.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.596
Um, it was a 'razepam.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.165
- Do you normally take
such strong medication?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.667
- No.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.570
My wife is a nurse,
so it's just...

41:47.572 --> 41:51.608
you know, it's around the house,
so I took one.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.945
- Okay.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.914
That's fine.

42:05.056 --> 42:09.259
- There you are.
You about done?

42:09.261 --> 42:11.728
He all better now?
Brain fixed? Tick?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.196
- We were just getting started.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.765
- Well, I'm sorry,
but I need to borrow him.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.536
- Mm-hm. Sorry.

42:19.538 --> 42:22.205
- Okay.
I'll catch you later.

42:28.245 --> 42:29.679
<i>One of your round-ups
from the weekend</i>

42:29.681 --> 42:31.047
<i>is keen for a plea deal.</i>

42:31.049 --> 42:32.815
<i>Uh-huh.
Which one?</i>

42:32.817 --> 42:34.951
<i>Doolan.</i>

42:34.953 --> 42:38.821
Turns out he's an ex-cop.

42:38.823 --> 42:40.223
Brisbane. Uniform.

42:40.225 --> 42:43.092
- Really?
- Yep.

42:43.094 --> 42:46.563
I heard about this business
with this Indian kid.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.064
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

42:48.066 --> 42:51.868
- So it's, uh, all good?

42:51.870 --> 42:53.770
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

42:53.772 --> 42:57.974
I mean, it was definitely odd,
but it's fine.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.676
- Good.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.015
- Come.

43:08.286 --> 43:10.787
<i>Ah, there he is.</i>

43:15.359 --> 43:16.859
- What does he want?

43:16.861 --> 43:18.094
- He's gonna give us
three names.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.228
- Three names for what?

43:19.230 --> 43:20.296
- Possession.

43:20.298 --> 43:23.066
- Possession?

43:23.068 --> 43:24.767
- Possession
with intent to sell,

43:24.769 --> 43:28.071
and my client's
agreed to cooperate.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.840
<i>He was manufacturing.</i>

43:30.842 --> 43:35.111
He was cooking up,
so, you know...

43:35.113 --> 43:36.913
We want the communications.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.148
- Three names.
Final offer.

43:40.317 --> 43:43.119
- Mmm. Mm-mm-mm.

43:45.089 --> 43:48.358
I imagine this whole business
is a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

43:48.360 --> 43:51.227
<i>For a decorated officer.</i>

43:51.229 --> 43:55.965
<i>It says you were injured
in 2002, discharged,</i>

43:55.967 --> 43:58.868
<i>and I bet they gave you
a pretty crap payout too, hm?</i>

44:02.873 --> 44:04.374
So, you know,
I get it, man.

44:04.376 --> 44:08.645
Look, let's forget it.
I get it. I totally get it.

44:08.647 --> 44:10.413
You got two kids,

44:10.415 --> 44:13.249
<i>and you don't want this getting
out in the press, do you?</i>

44:13.251 --> 44:15.852
<i>But it... it could.</i>

44:15.854 --> 44:17.987
<i>So, look, this is what
I think you should do.</i>

44:17.989 --> 44:20.256
What you should do is you tell
us how they're communicating,

44:20.258 --> 44:22.692
give us your names, yeah,
but how they're communicating.

44:22.694 --> 44:25.395
We'll give you a letter of
assistance for the magistrate,

44:25.397 --> 44:28.931
which is great, and we'll
keep you out of the press,

44:28.933 --> 44:30.667
get you immunity.

44:30.669 --> 44:32.702
<i>Or you don't cooperate with us</i>

44:32.704 --> 44:35.805
<i>and you end up in </i> the daily
telegraph <i> tomorrow morning,</i>

44:35.807 --> 44:38.174
which is not good.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.910
You know, we'll leak that stuff,
we'll give 'em a photo

44:40.912 --> 44:43.946
'cause, you know, we need
a bit of good press around here.

44:43.948 --> 44:46.182
<i>So we have three new players</i>

44:46.184 --> 44:50.687
<i>and we know how
they're communicating, finally.</i>

44:50.689 --> 44:54.957
We have an email address
they all have access to

44:54.959 --> 44:57.060
through a shared password.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.327
- You'll love 'em.

44:58.329 --> 44:59.796
There's new ones
from last night.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.330
Our lovely friend alcohol.

45:01.332 --> 45:03.766
Drunk-dial.
Sarah to Tina.

45:05.236 --> 45:08.104
"Stupid bitch."

45:08.106 --> 45:09.906
"Grow the fuck up."

45:11.042 --> 45:12.809
"Stupid slut."

45:12.811 --> 45:14.844
"Whore."

45:14.846 --> 45:17.847
Now, she doesn't give
anything specific away here,

45:17.849 --> 45:20.083
<i>but here...</i>

45:21.752 --> 45:23.086
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

45:23.088 --> 45:26.189
<i>This is Tina to Victor,
and I quote,</i>

45:26.191 --> 45:31.728
<i>"why am I fucking, you know,
protecting you two anyway?"</i>

46:36.560 --> 46:39.529
<i>Are on the right, second floor.</i>

46:39.531 --> 46:40.963
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.305
- Jemma.
- Hey.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.174
- What room is he in?
Is it 43?

46:51.176 --> 46:52.408
- 43.

46:52.410 --> 46:54.377
- I'll catch up with you.

48:21.465 --> 48:24.033
<i>And Jake made William
a card. Didn't you, Jake?</i>

48:24.035 --> 48:25.201
This is William's mum.

48:25.203 --> 48:26.269
Thank you.

48:27.404 --> 48:28.537
And this is Malcolm.

48:31.174 --> 48:33.242
- Hi. Hi.
These are for you.

48:33.244 --> 48:34.477
- Thank you.

48:34.479 --> 48:35.578
- We wanted to wait a day
or two.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.447
We didn't want to intrude.

48:38.449 --> 48:40.283
- You were with him?

48:40.285 --> 48:42.385
You helped him?
- Uh... uh, yeah.

48:42.387 --> 48:46.255
- They said without you,
he wouldn't...

48:47.557 --> 48:49.659
Thank you.

48:49.661 --> 48:51.527
I don't know how to
thank you properly.

48:53.163 --> 48:54.397
- That's...

48:54.399 --> 48:56.198
- No, there is no words
to thank you.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.401
- I really,

48:58.403 --> 48:59.568
I didn't...

49:03.473 --> 49:06.142
Look, it's... it's
really...

49:06.144 --> 49:07.510
Thank you. Thank you.

49:09.379 --> 49:12.014
Hey, we should probably...

49:12.016 --> 49:14.016
We should let you
get back to it.

49:14.018 --> 49:15.985
And we've got to
feed these little...

49:15.987 --> 49:17.486
- We just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

49:17.488 --> 49:19.422
- ...these rascals.

49:19.424 --> 49:20.424
- Thank you.

49:22.092 --> 49:24.327
- So, yeah, we didn't want to
intrude for very long.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.329
We just wanted to...

49:25.330 --> 49:26.562
- You have our number.

49:26.564 --> 49:28.331
If you need anything,
please call us.

49:28.333 --> 49:29.333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

49:29.334 --> 49:30.599
<i>Bye.</i>

49:30.601 --> 49:33.102
- Bye.
- Thank you.

49:33.104 --> 49:34.437
<i>Race you there.</i>

49:34.439 --> 49:36.339
<i>Whoever presses the button wins.</i>

49:36.341 --> 49:38.441
<i>- Let me press the button!
- Don't run, guys.</i>

50:19.449 --> 50:21.183
<i>Triple 0.
What service do you require?</i>

50:21.185 --> 50:23.586
<i>Ambulance. Emergency.</i>

50:23.588 --> 50:26.322
<i>Ambulance
emergency. What suburb?</i>

50:26.324 --> 50:28.324
<i>Kings park.</i>

50:28.326 --> 50:31.160
<i>Okay. Kings park. And
what's the exact address there?</i>

50:31.162 --> 50:34.430
<i>I'm on epson road</i>

50:34.432 --> 50:37.133
<i>and the nearest
cross street is, uh...</i>

50:39.803 --> 50:41.237
<i>Uh...</i>

50:41.239 --> 50:42.538
<i>We can...</i>

50:42.540 --> 50:45.241
<i>Ah, it's quarry... quarry road.</i>

50:45.243 --> 50:46.709
<i>Okay. Alright.</i>

50:46.711 --> 50:48.511
<i>So tell me exactly
what's happened.</i>

50:48.513 --> 50:50.646
<i>There's a boy
and he's on the road</i>

50:50.648 --> 50:56.318
<i>and he's had a...
He's fallen off his bike.</i>

50:56.320 --> 50:58.454
<i>And he's hit his head
and he's not moving.</i>

50:58.456 --> 50:59.588
- What am I supposed to...

50:59.590 --> 51:02.725
- hang on, wait.
Just listen.

51:02.727 --> 51:03.759
<i>He's unconscious and breathing,</i>

51:03.761 --> 51:05.194
<i>but he's not moving.</i>

51:05.196 --> 51:07.063
<i>Okay.</i>

51:07.065 --> 51:09.346
<i>Do you think that maybe he
could have been hit by a car?</i>

51:12.469 --> 51:14.537
<i>Uh...</i>

51:14.539 --> 51:16.772
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

51:16.774 --> 51:20.776
<i>I mean...
There's a possibility...</i>

51:20.778 --> 51:23.079
- There's a possibility.

51:23.081 --> 51:24.413
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Listen.

51:25.649 --> 51:26.849
<i>...He's not moving.</i>

51:26.851 --> 51:28.717
<i>Okay, alright.</i>

51:28.719 --> 51:31.000
<i>Do you think that maybe he
could have been hit by a car?</i>

51:34.091 --> 51:36.258
<i>Uh...</i>

51:36.260 --> 51:38.461
<i>No. I don't know.</i>

51:38.463 --> 51:41.397
<i>I mean...
There's a possibility,</i>

51:41.399 --> 51:43.666
<i>but he may have just
fallen off his bike.</i>

51:43.668 --> 51:45.301
<i>I don't know.</i>

51:45.303 --> 51:46.983
<i>Okay, but he's
lying on the road...</i>

51:53.143 --> 51:55.344
- I think we need to investigate
detective toohey further.

51:55.346 --> 51:59.682
- Oh, Jim, this is the stupid...
- I wanted to defer to you,

51:59.684 --> 52:03.185
but, you know,
I think if it's not too late,

52:03.187 --> 52:05.454
we should run a full forensic
on his car,

52:05.456 --> 52:07.523
you know, a structural check,
you know.

52:07.525 --> 52:09.391
<i>Detective toohey
should be questioned,</i>

52:09.393 --> 52:11.660
<i>perhaps even given a chance
to change his statement.</i>

52:11.662 --> 52:14.396
Or... rather,
to make a formal statement.

52:14.398 --> 52:16.265
- Look, I just don't know
what you're hearing.

52:16.267 --> 52:20.402
- The pause,
the time it takes him.

52:20.404 --> 52:22.471
I mean, he's lying.
The hesitation in his voice...

52:22.473 --> 52:25.574
- Okay, okay, just hold up,
just relax, alright.

52:25.576 --> 52:27.143
<i>He's a cop.</i>

52:27.145 --> 52:28.711
- Yeah.

52:28.713 --> 52:30.479
- Yeah, so he shouldn't be
panicked and hesitating.

52:30.481 --> 52:31.914
He's used to these situations.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.449
- He's got a little kid there
in serious need.

52:33.451 --> 52:34.517
- But you don't think
it takes him

52:34.519 --> 52:36.552
too long to give a clear answer?

52:36.554 --> 52:38.154
<i>Oh, no. I just think
you're reading stuff</i>

52:38.156 --> 52:39.788
into what seems to me
a pretty normal situation.

52:39.790 --> 52:42.525
Alarm bells
aren't ringing for me.

52:42.527 --> 52:43.726
- He's lying.

52:43.728 --> 52:45.594
- I think you want him
to be lying.

52:45.596 --> 52:48.464
- Okay. Then explain
this next thing.

52:50.867 --> 52:52.701
- So the operator
keeps him on the line,

52:52.703 --> 52:56.438
yeah, and he doesn't mention
anyone else,

52:56.440 --> 53:00.176
<i>anything suspicious,
no other cars, yeah?</i>

53:00.178 --> 53:03.812
So why in his statement
15 minutes later

53:03.814 --> 53:08.384
does he detail seeing another
car when he came across the kid?

53:08.386 --> 53:11.554
Tail-lights taking off
around the corner.

53:11.556 --> 53:14.256
I mean, you can say
he's under stress, but...

53:14.258 --> 53:16.358
- Okay, mate, you relax.

53:16.360 --> 53:20.462
This isn't proof
of anything, alright?

53:20.464 --> 53:23.299
I'll talk to him, okay?

53:23.301 --> 53:27.570
<i>And then I'll decide what's
the best course of action.</i>

53:29.406 --> 53:30.406
Okay?

53:31.875 --> 53:33.709
- Yeah.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.244
- For the record,

53:35.246 --> 53:36.979
I think you're drawing
a seriously long bow.

53:38.281 --> 53:39.982
- With all due respect, I...

53:41.885 --> 53:43.786
I really feel strongly
about this, Carl.

53:45.255 --> 53:46.622
<i>You know, and...</i>

53:48.825 --> 53:53.329
<i>I think it's possible
that, you know,</i>

53:53.331 --> 53:56.465
your personal relationship
with detective toohey

53:56.467 --> 53:58.367
<i>could be clouding
the issue a little.</i>

53:58.369 --> 54:00.336
- You really just said that?

54:00.338 --> 54:01.870
<i>Hey, no offence intended.</i>

54:01.872 --> 54:03.752
- I'll decide whether
there's any offence taken.

54:10.480 --> 54:11.614
<i>Uh, Carl?</i>

54:12.949 --> 54:14.683
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

54:16.419 --> 54:17.720
Yeah, I've got a minute.

54:21.024 --> 54:22.024
What's going on?

54:29.499 --> 54:30.566
Where are you right now?

54:55.892 --> 54:58.627
- Go and help those boys out
with the perimeter, will you?

54:58.629 --> 55:00.896
Make it your scene.
I'll handle things here.

55:00.898 --> 55:02.331
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.500
I want a wider perimeter.

55:04.502 --> 55:07.403
Bloody rubberneckers.

55:07.405 --> 55:09.938
- Yeah, copy that.
Folks, show some respect.

55:11.541 --> 55:15.678
- So, I, uh... heard you
took a shot yesterday.

55:15.680 --> 55:17.546
- Oh, yeah.

55:17.548 --> 55:18.847
- A very lucky one.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.316
Yeah, I was gonna try
and make the party,

55:20.318 --> 55:22.017
but Manny keeps me
tied to the house.

55:22.019 --> 55:23.719
That's why it's not the best
environment in the world

55:23.721 --> 55:25.621
to be the only one
on soda water.

55:27.625 --> 55:29.825
So, you're feeling a bit
under the weather, I bet.

55:29.827 --> 55:33.662
Yeah well, we'll have you out of
here in a few minutes,

55:33.664 --> 55:35.030
so just run me through
what happened.

55:35.032 --> 55:37.066
You found the kid?

55:39.669 --> 55:40.669
- Mmm.

55:42.672 --> 55:46.442
Yeah, I don't know exactly
what happened, 'cause...

55:52.549 --> 55:53.582
Look, I think that, um...

55:55.352 --> 55:56.352
<i>You think what?</i>

55:59.956 --> 56:01.857
Don't fucking bullshit me.

56:06.896 --> 56:09.064
<i>Have you made a statement?</i>

56:09.066 --> 56:10.066
<i>Nothing?</i>

56:14.971 --> 56:18.640
Did, uh...
Did anyone see you?

56:21.644 --> 56:22.911
How much have you had to drink?

56:25.715 --> 56:27.383
- I had a bit,
I had a bit.

56:27.385 --> 56:28.751
- Oh, fuck.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.821
Uh, are there any marks
on the car?

56:32.823 --> 56:35.057
- I didn't hear any noise,

56:35.059 --> 56:38.394
so I think I hit his body.

56:38.396 --> 56:39.762
I hit him with the side mirror.

56:39.764 --> 56:41.697
<i>Alright.</i>

56:41.699 --> 56:42.731
Here's what happened.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.768
Here's what happened.

56:45.770 --> 56:47.903
You rounded the corner,
you saw what you saw,

56:47.905 --> 56:49.805
a shape at the side of the road.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.640
A kid, but you didn't
know that then.

56:51.642 --> 56:55.144
At the t intersection,
you saw a vehicle,

56:55.146 --> 56:58.147
the engine idling, brake lights.

56:58.149 --> 56:59.715
You don't know
what kind of vehicle.

56:59.717 --> 57:01.417
Then it took off really quickly,

57:01.419 --> 57:03.852
then you pulled over
to help the kid.

57:06.923 --> 57:08.624
Alright?

57:08.626 --> 57:09.626
Alright?

57:12.028 --> 57:13.662
Okay.

57:13.664 --> 57:15.864
<i>Constable, the breathalyzer?</i>

57:18.735 --> 57:20.102
Thank you.

57:23.007 --> 57:29.144
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

57:29.146 --> 57:32.514
Right. Now your turn.
Count to ten.

57:32.516 --> 57:35.117
- One, two, three, four, five,

57:35.119 --> 57:37.653
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

57:37.655 --> 57:42.024
- Okay. I'm gonna take care of
the forensics, alright.

57:42.026 --> 57:43.692
You play your part.

57:43.694 --> 57:45.661
If the wheels fall off,
you're on your own.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.062
You hear me?

57:47.064 --> 57:50.666
Now, you didn't
mean to do anything bad.

57:50.668 --> 57:52.201
Alright?
Just fucking relax.

57:52.203 --> 57:53.669
I'll get you through this.

57:54.838 --> 57:56.205
Constable,
can you come here?

57:56.207 --> 57:57.906
- Yes, sir.

57:57.908 --> 58:00.876
- So, no point no no,
not <i> that</i> good of a party.

58:00.878 --> 58:02.778
- Ready. One, two, three.

58:04.948 --> 58:05.948
Bars up?

58:08.585 --> 58:09.885
- Good to go.
- Yep.

58:14.190 --> 58:15.624
- That's it.

58:17.827 --> 58:18.827
- Take it easy, mal.

58:20.798 --> 58:22.064
It's gonna be fine.

58:22.066 --> 58:23.066
<i>Thanks.</i>

59:22.258 --> 59:24.560
You've got to calm down,

59:24.562 --> 59:25.661
okay?

59:25.663 --> 59:27.796
You're being paranoid.

59:27.798 --> 59:29.231
What business you had

59:29.233 --> 59:31.733
going around there in
the first place is the question.

59:31.735 --> 59:33.669
- What's he going
around there for?

59:33.671 --> 59:34.671
He's going around there.

59:34.672 --> 59:35.804
- He's a crusader.

59:35.806 --> 59:37.940
Jesus, the pair of you!

59:37.942 --> 59:39.775
What were you thinking?

59:39.777 --> 59:41.209
"If I don't run down there soon
with a box of chocolates,

59:41.211 --> 59:43.078
"she's gonna be offended?"

59:43.080 --> 59:45.113
- I've gotta tell the truth.
I've got to come clean.

59:45.115 --> 59:46.915
- Why?

59:46.917 --> 59:48.350
Because you felt a little
rabbit in the headlights?

59:48.352 --> 59:50.352
Because you think
the woman suspects something

59:50.354 --> 59:53.055
and suddenly you feel worse?
Because Jim...

59:53.057 --> 59:54.957
- no. Before all that.

59:54.959 --> 59:56.692
Because it is
the right thing to do.

59:56.694 --> 59:58.126
- Oh, really?

59:58.128 --> 59:59.861
It's not because all of a sudden

59:59.863 --> 01:00:02.831
you think the whole thing's
gonna come apart?

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:08.370
- No, ever since this shit just
jumped out of my fucking mouth.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.005
- Don't distance yourself.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:11.007
You did that.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.074
You did that yourself.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:13.308
- I don't know why I did it.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:15.811
- Survival's why you did it.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:16.912
And now you've got to own it.

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.747
Now, stop with this bullshit.

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:21.984
- Bullshit.

01:00:21.986 --> 01:00:24.019
<i>It's bullshit.</i>

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:25.821
<i>Now, listen to me for a second.</i>

01:00:25.823 --> 01:00:29.091
<i>We've got to keep this tight,
mal, and be smart,</i>

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:31.827
and make sure whatever happens,
nothing comes out,

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:33.228
'cause if it does,
it's gonna be worse

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.297
'cause we're all in it,

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:36.732
the whole force, mate.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.369
I stuck my neck out
from the get-go.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:43.205
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know,</i>

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:45.407
<i>you told the first lie.
I picked up on it.</i>

01:00:45.409 --> 01:00:47.643
So, limited forensic,
no in-depth,

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:49.277
the breath test.
You add it up.

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:50.912
- Carl, I didn't ask
for any of that.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:53.115
- Of course you did,
with your "help me" face.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.950
Your "I've pissed my pants,
help me" face.

01:00:54.952 --> 01:00:56.218
<i>'Course you fucking did.</i>
- I changed my mind.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.320
- Oh, bullshit, you have.
Bullshit!

01:00:59.756 --> 01:01:01.356
Fuck off! No way!

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:06.228
Oh, what?
You bring me in and then 180?

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.030
Bullshit, you will.

01:01:09.065 --> 01:01:10.866
The bigger picture, mal.

01:01:10.868 --> 01:01:12.134
The bigger picture.

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:13.835
Think of your family,
the investigation.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.370
<i>Your reputation.</i>

01:01:15.372 --> 01:01:19.074
<i>Six months' hard work.
12, 13 arrests.</i>

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:22.077
You want to discredit all of us
and unpick that too?

01:01:22.079 --> 01:01:23.745
<i>Well, I'm not gonna let you.</i>

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.213
<i>Grow a fucking brain.</i>

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:30.018
I don't know why we're getting
all worked up about this.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.153
I really don't.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.423
You know, so...

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:37.225
Don't wave yourself
off the pitch for a mistake

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:39.161
because suddenly
it's eating away at you.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:40.996
Well, of course it is.

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:42.330
You did some damage.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.439
You remember that woman
that ploughed into Liam?

01:01:50.441 --> 01:01:52.107
You know, 50s, three kids.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:55.444
Absolutely distraught
at what... what she'd done.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:58.380
Well, I saw her sat in court.

01:01:58.382 --> 01:02:00.716
You know, a million
terrible things going on,

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:03.385
<i>you know, worse than yours,
and it was killing me, but,</i>

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.221
you know,
what can you do?

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:10.292
Time.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:16.331
Time and the world
swallows events.

01:02:18.101 --> 01:02:21.336
<i>And it's sad,
but that's how it is.</i>

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:28.076
And you and me, you know,

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:30.812
the world is gonna
swallow us up,

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.115
and who knows in the end
if we leave a mark?

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:35.150
But...

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.854
But we're doing something.

01:02:38.856 --> 01:02:40.789
And I like to think
we're doing something good

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:43.391
with what we're given.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:46.294
<i>Don't wave yourself off
over this.</i>

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:47.796
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:50.999
Five years in the Nick for...
For nothing?

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:53.135
That's stupid.

01:02:53.137 --> 01:02:55.036
Prison is for pricks

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:57.472
that don't have
their punishment here.

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.343
Not you.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.147
Not me.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:09.184
It doesn't make sense.

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:13.822
Alright?

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:52.961
- Ah, slim, caught with
your hand in the cookie jar.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.467
<i>We're on.</i>

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:02.604
Newcastle's nabbing Victor
and Sarah's being brought in.

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.239
Let's go.

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:34.636
<i>Got him leaving baggage now.</i>

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:40.375
<i>He's one fuckin' fat
17 year-old, man.</i>

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:45.146
<i>Anyone order a serving
of won-ton kid?</i>

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:51.286
<i>"One fat fuck to go, pwease."</i>

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:54.422
- Wanna shut up unless you've
got something worth saying?

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.926
<i>Uh, yeah,
copy that. Sorry, slim.</i>

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.064
<i>Yeah, you should have him now.</i>

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:05.033
- Is that him?

01:05:05.035 --> 01:05:06.902
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:07.904
- Shall we go?

01:05:27.456 --> 01:05:28.456
- Excuse me, buddy.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.592
- Hey, nguyen?

01:05:30.594 --> 01:05:31.927
- Phuk nguyen, yeah?

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:33.561
- Yeah.
What is this about?

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.531
- Oh, I just want to have
a little word with you.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:38.066
Hey, fellas.
It's alright. Hang back.

01:05:38.068 --> 01:05:39.434
- Yeah, mate,
I'll look after that.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:42.203
- Oh, is that the, uh...

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.505
Is that the new one?

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:45.140
- Uh, yeah.

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.374
- Let's have a seat.
Let's have a chat.

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:47.542
- Alright, mate.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.144
- Just relax. It's okay.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:51.279
Maybe that's
a bit uncomfortable.

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:53.715
- Yeah, take that off, mate.
- Yeah, take it off.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.221
<i>You're fucked, both of you.</i>

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:02.557
<i>You hear me, pig fuck?
Fuck you both!</i>

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.025
<i>I'll make sure
you're fucking dead</i>

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.360
<i>by the end of fucking tonight.</i>

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:06.695
<i>How about that?
Fucking faggots!</i>

01:06:06.697 --> 01:06:08.330
Keep the threats coming, pal.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.231
Yeah? How about this
for a fucking threat, huh?

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.601
<i>- How about that
for a fucking threat, huh?</i>

01:06:13.603 --> 01:06:14.970
- <i> Damaging police property.</i>
- Stop it, slim.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:16.404
<i>I'm fucking 17.</i>

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.439
What the fuck are you guys gonna
fucking do to me?

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:20.642
Huh? Huh? How about that, huh?

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.210
<i>Hey, settle down.</i>

01:06:22.212 --> 01:06:23.545
<i>- Fuck you!
- Settle down!</i>

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:24.646
<i>What are you gonna do to me?</i>

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:26.414
<i>Come on, pig!
Come on!</i>

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.250
<i>What do you want?
Fucking faggot pig!</i>

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:30.986
<i>Come get me, fucking pig!</i>

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.454
<i>Shut up!</i>

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.255
<i>- Come get me, pig!
- Come on, pig!</i>

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:37.325
<i>Yeah! You're fucked, pig!
Come get me, pig!</i>

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.561
<i>- Shut up!
- Pig! Fuck you!</i>

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:40.563
- Shut up!

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:44.299
Mal!

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:49.004
Say something!
Say something!

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.479
I put a copy of
that report on your desk.

01:06:59.515 --> 01:07:02.183
Don't worry.
It's all good.

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.152
- I'm, um...

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:16.157
..In trouble, love.

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.595
I didn't find that kid
on the road.

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:27.435
I hit him...

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.270
..With my car.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.810
<i>I didn't mean to lie about it.</i>

01:08:36.813 --> 01:08:39.413
<i>I just did.</i>

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:40.782
<i>I just said it.</i>

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.551
<i>It just came out of my mouth.</i>

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:51.259
<i>First to emergency
and then to ambos.</i>

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.564
I meant to take it back,
but I didn't.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:17.385
'Cause I was scared.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:27.228
So...

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.901
I'm gonna have to say something.

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:38.439
I've got to tell the truth.

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.249
- He has brain damage.

01:09:53.923 --> 01:09:55.590
<i>There's every chance
that he'll die.</i>

01:09:58.327 --> 01:09:59.794
Jemma told me at the hospital.

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:05.233
I didn't think
to say anything because...

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:06.601
Jesus Christ.

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:27.555
- Um, Carl... knows.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:32.460
And he wants me
to keep my mouth shut.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.503
- I want you to listen to him.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.643
To Carl.

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:53.314
To not say anything.

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.821
Don't say anything.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.865
We can live with this.

01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:31.753
<i>However, at this stage,</i>

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:33.888
<i>that either the prints
or the dog</i>

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.024
<i>in fact belong to you.</i>

01:11:36.026 --> 01:11:37.792
<i>In the circumstances,</i>

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:40.828
<i>I'm left with no choice
but to grant bail.</i>

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.331
The bail will be granted on
the following conditions.

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:46.801
You will reside at
65-117 crayview Crescent,

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.403
<i>rossdale park.</i>

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:50.438
<i>You will report to the officer
in charge...</i>

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:56.611
<i>..Between the hours
of 8am and 7pm.</i>

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:58.546
<i>You will surrender your passport</i>

01:11:58.548 --> 01:12:01.582
<i>and you are not to approach
any children</i>

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:04.986
<i>or be in the vicinity of
playgrounds or schools.</i>

01:12:06.922 --> 01:12:08.890
<i>Carl, will you settle down?</i>

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:10.658
<i>- It's lazy.
- Carl...</i>

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.360
- It's bullshit and it's lazy.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.062
Listen, Carl,
you don't pull your head in...

01:12:14.064 --> 01:12:16.597
- Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:18.333
He reoffends,

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:20.702
I shall hold this fucking court
personally responsible.

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:22.370
<i>How's that for contempt?</i>

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.014
Get a couple of glasses.

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:55.870
Sometimes I fucking wonder
why I'm here.

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:05.380
Ah. Well, we should get
a good lift off this.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.482
What'll I find?
Overdue library book?

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.151
- Um...

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.688
Aren't you sort of...

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.158
Not supposed to...

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:20.661
- You've got to learn to finish
your sentences, mate.

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:22.997
Not supposed to what?

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:24.098
- Nothing.

01:13:25.667 --> 01:13:27.668
- Yeah, well, the courts
go back on shit.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.670
Why shouldn't I?

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:33.841
Bail. For a guy
with the history that he has.

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:35.710
<i>Then he walks out,
just like that.</i>

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:42.483
To the biggest criminal of all,
the court system.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:13:59.934
- Shit.

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.104
Sorry, I've got to...

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:08.743
Ankhila? Hi.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:11.512
Is everything alright?

01:14:11.514 --> 01:14:14.081
Uh...

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:19.687
Sure.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:22.590
Yeah, no worries.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:30.198
Yeah, no worries.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.901
Take care. Yep. Bye.

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:41.809
Um, I've got to take off.

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:46.881
<i>Anything you need me
to wrap up around here or...?</i>

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:51.619
- Yeah, yeah, go. Go.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.868
- Hello.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.305
- Hey.
- Uh... I'm sorry.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:51.679
I just wanted to thank you,
and, um, here you are.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:55.082
- That's alright.
I was just in the area, so...

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:07.228
- So... yes?

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:13.935
- Listen, I, um...

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.772
I just wanted to tell you
personally

01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:20.308
that we're doing everything
we can on our end

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:23.210
<i>to find out who did this,</i>

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:28.783
<i>and, uh, we have
some really strong leads.</i>

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.224
<i>Wouldn't you want to know?</i>

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:41.162
- Mmm... I, um... yes.

01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:45.833
Look, I think I should be
getting back, okay?

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.335
Thank you again for the flowers.

01:16:47.337 --> 01:16:50.371
<i>Ankhila, um...</i>

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:56.677
Tomorrow, I'd really love to
help you out, if I can.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:03.618
You know, save time on the bus.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.119
Faster and cheaper than a taxi.

01:17:07.123 --> 01:17:08.856
- Can I think about it?

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:15.096
- Yeah. Yeah, of course
you can think about it.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:23.804
Carl.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.241
Yeah, mate,

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:29.677
I'm just about to walk into
my sister's place for dinner.

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:30.911
What is it?

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.220
Are you following me?

01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:44.959
- Alright, let's be adults
about this.

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:46.060
You want to get in the car?

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.997
Come on, let's get in the car
and let's talk.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.667
- Let's talk here.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.774
- I, uh...
I checked out your theory.

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.375
Ran it by the boss

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:04.912
and then we had a conference
with two senior-ranked officers.

01:18:04.914 --> 01:18:06.313
And?

01:18:06.315 --> 01:18:08.816
- And you need to know
what was passed on to me.

01:18:08.818 --> 01:18:09.818
Okay.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.220
- It stops here.

01:18:13.222 --> 01:18:14.255
No more.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.260
- Who were these other
senior-ranked officers, Carl?

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:21.228
- Never you mind.
- "Never you mind"?

01:18:21.230 --> 01:18:23.364
- No, no. It doesn't matter.
It's a sensitive issue.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.099
They would prefer
not to be named.

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:29.937
- When exactly
did this take place?

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.208
There was a meeting,
was there?

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.977
Yeah, a conference?

01:18:36.979 --> 01:18:38.946
Yeah, you just
gave yourself away, mate.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:41.048
- You're making a habit
of going solo,

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.116
having your own opinions.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:43.484
- I don't like being threatened.

01:18:43.486 --> 01:18:45.152
- Who's threatening who?

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:47.054
- Making shit up
to influence me. That's a...

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:50.925
And you drove here.
I mean, you're smashed, mate.

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:52.359
- You're a fucking prick.

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.261
- Alright.
Take it easy.

01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:57.064
- Yeah, that's right.
That's what you are.

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:58.966
You're the guy nobody likes.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.136
You're the guy in the band
that's always complaining.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:05.272
See, we're in a band, right?
Like a musical band.

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:06.841
Can you imagine that?

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:08.409
And when somebody in the band
writes a song,

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:11.345
like it or hate it,
we fucking sing it.

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:13.080
And if someone in the band

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.849
happens to write a fucking
shitty song that nobody likes,

01:19:14.851 --> 01:19:17.985
we keep our opinions
to ourselves and sing it anyway.

01:19:17.987 --> 01:19:21.155
We don't stand to one side
and laugh and point and say,

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:24.992
"oh! Oh, that's shit.
I'm not doing that."

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.862
'Cause that doesn't look good
for the band, does it?

01:19:30.332 --> 01:19:32.299
And one day you're gonna go bad.

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:33.868
You're gonna write
a fucking shitty song.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:35.503
I know it.

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.338
And then where will you be?

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:38.939
On your own,

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.008
'cause you're the guy
that wants to go solo.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:43.210
You're the guy
with the best judgment.

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:48.549
Look, he didn't set out
to do a bad thing

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:50.818
and don't make it out
like he did.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.121
Victor.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.956
Victor, he set out
to do a bad thing

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.425
to that little girl.
That's who.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:01.195
Not someone who made
a fucking genuine mistake.

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:06.267
So use your fucking head.

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:08.102
Stop being a prick.

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.041
- Finished?

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:32.887
- Hold that.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.392
Ankhila, wait.

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.461
Ankhila!

01:22:34.616 --> 01:22:36.216
<i>Level four.</i>

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:43.584
Ankhila <i> no.</i>

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:46.220
<i>No.</i>

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.296
<i>- Mal, mal.</i>

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.367
Listen, I thought
you should know.

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:01.402
I just found out...

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.506
That young boy you saved,

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:10.144
yeah, he... he passed
about an hour ago, mate.

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.422
<i>Young Indian boy</i>

01:25:28.424 --> 01:25:30.257
<i>William sarduka.</i>

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:33.327
<i>Tragically, today, William
passed away in hospital</i>

01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:35.729
<i>after spending three days
in a coma</i>

01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:37.631
<i>as a result of his injuries.</i>

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:41.168
<i>He now becomes the fifth
fatality in similar accidents</i>

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:43.470
<i>in less than four months.</i>

01:25:43.472 --> 01:25:45.339
<i>Coming up next on sky news,</i>

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:48.575
<i>the latest finance figures
and all the sport.</i>

01:25:54.449 --> 01:25:56.884
<i>Some of us
are so focused on our hair</i>

01:25:56.886 --> 01:25:59.386
<i>that we're blinded
to the fact...</i>

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.714
- I...

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:29.750
I, um...

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:39.493
I might not seem like
a good person,

01:26:39.495 --> 01:26:40.961
<i>but I have to be a good mother.</i>

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.299
<i>I think what I said
last night...</i>

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:48.869
<i>Is right.</i>

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.775
And I hate myself for saying it.

01:26:56.644 --> 01:26:58.345
It's...

01:26:58.347 --> 01:27:01.215
It's horrible,

01:27:01.217 --> 01:27:02.583
but you've done this to me.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:08.322
You've made me this.

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.936
- Yeah, I'm just
leaving the house.

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:25.572
Nah, I got held up.
I'll be there in a minute.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:29.843
Is the kid coming?
Have you got the plastic top

01:27:29.845 --> 01:27:31.378
and the shovel?

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.547
Okay.

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:35.949
Okay.

01:27:37.986 --> 01:27:39.786
Joking.

01:27:42.490 --> 01:27:44.424
So...

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:46.526
What's this all a fucking 'bout?

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:48.362
Team talk?

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:49.496
- Did you threaten her?

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:53.267
- Who?
- Did you go and see her?

01:27:53.269 --> 01:27:55.769
- Be man enough to admit it.
Did you?

01:27:55.771 --> 01:28:01.475
- Well, as far as I know,
that's your bag.

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:03.477
Yeah. I put on the siren.

01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:06.013
I was here in no time.

01:28:06.015 --> 01:28:08.715
So, let's get to it.

01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:11.351
No more small talk.
Brass tacks.

01:28:11.353 --> 01:28:13.620
Bare bones.
To the punch.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:14.888
- Sounds good to me.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:16.890
Yeah, well,
sounds good to the kid?

01:28:16.892 --> 01:28:18.892
<i>Gotta run everything by the kid.</i>

01:28:20.995 --> 01:28:23.063
No, I'm serious.
We're all here.

01:28:23.065 --> 01:28:24.065
- Okay.

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.334
So...

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:30.671
I'm gonna come clean.

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:34.474
But I'm gonna do it in a way

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.977
so that no one else gets
involved or implicated.

01:28:41.916 --> 01:28:43.717
So I've made up my mind.

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:46.787
<i>So that's what's gonna happen.</i>

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:50.357
<i>Yeah, well, you sound like</i>

01:28:50.359 --> 01:28:51.625
<i>you're trying to
convince yourself.</i>

01:28:51.627 --> 01:28:53.827
<i>I just wanted you both to know.</i>

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:55.495
- Yeah, well, now we know.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.398
Is that it?

01:28:58.400 --> 01:29:00.100
'Cause that was worth the trip.

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:04.438
You're a fucking scared
little prick.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:07.941
<i>You're piss-weak.</i>

01:29:07.943 --> 01:29:09.710
- I'm not gonna bring you
into it.

01:29:09.712 --> 01:29:11.378
- Oh, sure, like I'm not
gonna get Turkey slapped

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.714
when you drag your
little cock to confession.

01:29:13.716 --> 01:29:14.716
Piss-weak.

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:18.785
Oh, yeah, Jim, before you
get on your white horse

01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:20.120
and ride off into the sunset,

01:29:20.122 --> 01:29:23.790
tell me, because
I really want to know...

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:25.425
did you fuck her?

01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:26.493
'Cause I hope you did.

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.930
Did you do the funky zebra?

01:29:29.932 --> 01:29:31.665
Did you make it top deck?

01:29:33.001 --> 01:29:35.369
Because, you know,
if you didn't already,

01:29:35.371 --> 01:29:38.605
this'll definitely get you
into the...

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:41.007
Watch out for aids.

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:45.112
- Jim! Jim!

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.549
- Carl, Carl, Carl!

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.387
Jim, let him fucking go.

01:29:53.389 --> 01:29:55.622
- Ah...
- Let go!

01:29:57.092 --> 01:29:58.792
Hey!

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:02.729
Hey! Oi! Oi, relax!

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:07.434
Just fucking leave me alone,
for fuck sake.

01:30:07.436 --> 01:30:08.436
Carl.

01:30:10.405 --> 01:30:12.005
Carl?

01:30:12.007 --> 01:30:14.040
- I wasn't choking him.
Carl?

01:30:14.042 --> 01:30:16.176
- Carl. Carl.

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:17.677
- Is he alright?
- Oh, fuck, Jim.

01:30:17.679 --> 01:30:18.812
Get an ambulance.

01:30:18.814 --> 01:30:20.781
- What?
- Call an ambulance.

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:22.048
Carl?

01:30:22.050 --> 01:30:23.650
Call a fucking ambulance.
- Alright!

01:30:23.652 --> 01:30:28.021
- Jesus! Carl?
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

01:30:28.023 --> 01:30:29.656
- Ambulance, please.

01:30:29.658 --> 01:30:32.058
- Carl! Carl!
- Yeah. I...

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.901
- Yeah.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.708
Yeah.

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:55.582
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:30:55.584 --> 01:30:57.217
- I'm gonna have to go
pretty soon,

01:30:57.219 --> 01:31:00.921
but I'll come back again
and I'll see you tomorrow.

01:31:00.923 --> 01:31:01.923
<i>Good.</i>

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:04.558
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.726
- I'm gonna wrap up the whole...

01:31:06.728 --> 01:31:07.728
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:09.663
- Nguyen thing.

01:31:09.665 --> 01:31:11.064
Then it'll be over and...

01:31:11.066 --> 01:31:12.799
<i>Yeah. Good.</i>

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:15.469
- Hopefully no more gun fights.

01:31:15.471 --> 01:31:16.471
<i>Good.</i>

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:20.640
Yeah. Good.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.680
<i>So I'll see you soon, okay?</i>

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.205
You should go home.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.018
Listen, I spoke to the doctor.

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:09.289
This thing was gonna happen
regardless, they reckon.

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:12.959
He wasn't much into health.

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.609
You know
there's no cameras there

01:32:29.611 --> 01:32:31.044
in the back of tamberine's.

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:37.784
I don't want him indicted...

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.121
Or brought into this in any way.

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:45.692
Okay? Just give me
a couple of days.

01:32:45.694 --> 01:32:46.993
That's all I ask.

01:32:46.995 --> 01:32:48.962
Just once tomorrow's done, yeah?

01:32:48.964 --> 01:32:51.698
- Hi, mal.
- Hey, Manny. You okay?

01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:52.766
- Good to see your face.

01:32:52.768 --> 01:32:54.601
- Hey, buddy.
How are you?

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.998
Hey.
Julie and Mel aren't here

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.367
right now, please leave
a message after the beep.

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:27.220
<i>Hey, William!
Hey, William!</i>

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:22.475
- Hey! Hey!

01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:26.012
Hey! Hey!

01:36:26.014 --> 01:36:27.147
Mate!

01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:28.381
Oi!

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:48.461
<i>Sir, can you hear me?</i>

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:54.560
Sir? Can you hear me?

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.097
Sir?

01:38:58.099 --> 01:38:59.699
Sir, can you hear me?

01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:02.168
<i>Did someone hurt you, sir?</i>

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:04.437
<i>Did someone here hurt you?</i>

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:05.439
<i>- Police.</i>

01:39:06.441 --> 01:39:07.941
<i>Open up. Police.</i>

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:10.677
<i>Yes?</i>

01:39:10.679 --> 01:39:12.278
<i>I called you.
I telephoned.</i>

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.681
- Okay, can you let us in,
please, ma'am?

01:39:14.683 --> 01:39:16.282
- No, no.
<i>I-I know him.</i>

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:18.184
- Just relax, sir.
- I called you.

01:39:18.186 --> 01:39:19.419
<i>Who else is here?
Anyone else here?</i>

01:39:19.421 --> 01:39:20.553
- Just relax here.
It's okay.

01:39:20.555 --> 01:39:21.621
<i>My niece, nisha.</i>

01:39:21.623 --> 01:39:23.623
- She didn't do anything to me.

01:39:23.625 --> 01:39:25.224
<i>- It's okay, sir.</i>

01:39:25.226 --> 01:39:26.693
- He just came to my door
and I called you.

01:39:26.695 --> 01:39:30.029
- Okay. I understand.
So do you know this man?

01:39:31.566 --> 01:39:33.166
- She didn't do anything to me.

01:39:33.168 --> 01:39:34.467
- Yes, you know him?
- Yes, I know him.

01:39:34.469 --> 01:39:36.069
- Do you know
what's happened to him?

01:39:36.071 --> 01:39:38.037
- She didn't do anything to me.

01:39:38.039 --> 01:39:40.273
I just came here.

01:39:40.275 --> 01:39:41.407
It was me.

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:44.677
I'm sorry.

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.749
I'm so sorry.

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:56.122
She didn't do anything to me.

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:03.730
She didn't do anything to me.
I just... it was me.

01:40:03.732 --> 01:40:05.298
<i>Please just leave me.</i>

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:07.166
<i>Just leave me, please.</i>

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:26.319
- So you're not feeling
dizzy or anything?

01:40:26.321 --> 01:40:28.154
Can you hold that for me?

01:40:28.156 --> 01:40:30.089
You don't have
any blurred vision?

01:40:30.091 --> 01:40:31.391
Okay.

01:40:31.393 --> 01:40:34.060
- I'm sorry about this,
detective.

01:40:34.062 --> 01:40:36.729
She said that you had
helped her son.

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.076
Just give me a sec.

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.116
- You okay?

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.156
- Come on, sweetie.

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:05.158
Whoops.

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:07.727
Got it?

01:41:09.696 --> 01:41:10.797
A kiss. Mwah.

01:41:21.775 --> 01:41:23.209
- Have a great day, buddy.

01:41:23.211 --> 01:41:24.211
- Yeah, okay.

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:26.245
- Okay?

01:41:29.316 --> 01:41:30.850
<i>Bye, Jake!</i>
