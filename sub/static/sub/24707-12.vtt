00:03.630 --> 00:06.934
If you touch Mom again, you're gonna
get locked up if I have to do it myself.

00:06.998 --> 00:08.890
- So I slapped her once.
- That's once too many!

00:08.955 --> 00:11.099
- He slapped her twice.
- What's going on with this family situation?

00:11.169 --> 00:13.630
My dad was doing some interior decoration
on Joe's Bar.

00:13.703 --> 00:15.978
It was round two after he
knocked my mom around at home.

00:16.044 --> 00:18.122
- You know how Daddy gets.
- Yeah, I know.

00:18.194 --> 00:21.464
I'm not excusing him. I'm just saying
try not to let him hurt you.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.089
Take the homeless
all these friggin' magazines...

00:24.161 --> 00:26.337
you subscribe to
and maybe they can read them!

00:26.407 --> 00:28.649
Daddy, shut up!

00:57.203 --> 00:59.795
Morning.

00:59.865 --> 01:02.327
Come on, Medavoy, huh?

01:02.400 --> 01:06.184
While you're staying in the crib, pull
yourself together before you come downstairs.

01:06.249 --> 01:08.809
Otherwise it's like working
in a rooming house.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.336
Yesterday, I checked out
a one bedroom over on Third Avenue.

01:12.409 --> 01:14.936
The whole place is smaller
than this locker room.

01:15.007 --> 01:17.796
Bathtub in the kitchen.
The guy wants 1, 100 a month.

01:17.862 --> 01:21.767
Yeah. Plus you're living next door
to a guy who wears earrings in his tongue.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.362
Exactly. Compared to what's out there,
the crib's not bad.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.057
Detective, this woman
has information about a murder.

01:33.133 --> 01:35.692
Uh, here.
Why don't you come around here?

01:35.763 --> 01:41.178
Have a seat here.
I'm Detective Sipowicz.

01:41.248 --> 01:43.643
My husband killed somebody,
and you have to arrest him.

01:43.719 --> 01:46.443
- What's your name?
- Chandra Esposito.

01:46.509 --> 01:49.101
- What's your husband's name?
- Rickie Esposito.

01:49.172 --> 01:52.924
- He do that to your eye?
- Yes. He smacked me around some.

01:52.990 --> 01:55.812
Last night, I finally told him
that I wasn't gonna take it anymore...

01:55.877 --> 01:58.087
and he-
he said if I'd try and leave him...

01:58.155 --> 02:02.191
he would, uh, kill me the way
he done that boy eight years ago.

02:02.260 --> 02:04.633
- He killed a kid eight years ago?
- Yeah.

02:04.699 --> 02:07.870
Before we hooked up,
he lived over on 49th Street...

02:07.939 --> 02:11.263
with, uh, Lanie Rivera
and her three kids.

02:11.339 --> 02:14.796
Then last night, he tells me that he,
uh, killed her boy, Sal.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.815
He was how old eight years ago?

02:16.890 --> 02:18.749
It sounded to me
like he was grown up.

02:18.814 --> 02:21.921
You know, uh,
pretty much grown.

02:21.990 --> 02:24.647
- Is she still on 49th?
- Yeah.

02:24.717 --> 02:28.621
Um, 913 West 49th.

02:28.695 --> 02:31.068
All right.
We'll look into that.

02:31.132 --> 02:33.046
I think you ought to
look into a shelter.

02:33.121 --> 02:37.835
No, I don't need a shelter.
Just arrest him...

02:37.902 --> 02:39.794
or he's gonna kill me.

02:44.766 --> 02:46.626
- Good morning.
- What's going on?

02:46.691 --> 02:49.546
Just caught
an eight-year-old homicide.

02:49.611 --> 02:53.198
- Eight years?
- Yeah. Unless somebody's making up stories.

02:53.267 --> 02:55.159
- Are you up?
- Uh, yeah, I'm up.

02:55.225 --> 02:57.849
Hey, Bobby,
hold up a minute.

02:57.920 --> 03:00.796
Detective Russell,
can I speak with you?

03:00.870 --> 03:02.784
Yeah.

03:06.870 --> 03:10.009
Hey, Andy, I'll come with you.
I wanna check out that neighborhood.

03:20.888 --> 03:25.569
Um, Diane...

03:25.636 --> 03:28.490
there's been a shooting
at your parents' apartment.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.530
- A shooting?
- Yeah.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.681
Your father's been killed.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.275
What?

03:38.340 --> 03:40.200
Your father's been killed.

03:40.265 --> 03:42.660
I'm very sorry.

03:46.969 --> 03:48.883
- Where's my mom?
- Your mom's okay.

03:48.958 --> 03:51.266
She's at the apartment.

03:51.332 --> 03:56.166
But, Diane, it looks like your brother
may have been involved.

03:56.240 --> 03:59.029
- Involved? How?
- Apparently he did it, Diane.

04:01.438 --> 04:03.297
Lieutenant,
I have to get over there.

04:03.362 --> 04:05.375
Look, I need you to take care
of yourself, okay?

04:05.447 --> 04:07.973
- I can't let you work this.
- Yeah, okay.

04:08.046 --> 04:10.123
- Now, Bobby's up.
- I gotta get over there.

04:10.195 --> 04:13.750
Take a minute. Um, I'll fill him in,
and then he'll drive you, okay?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.997
I gotta get over there.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.517
- My father's a D.O.A. At Homicide.
- What happened?

04:20.589 --> 04:22.449
Boss'll fill you in.
I gotta go.

04:22.514 --> 04:24.428
A neighbor called 911
and said the brother shot him.

04:24.502 --> 04:26.897
Oh, man!
I don't want her driving alone.

04:26.973 --> 04:29.500
I don't want her driving either, but
evidently, that's what she wants to do.

04:29.571 --> 04:32.645
- Diane!
- Are you catching the case, or you taking care of Russell?

04:32.715 --> 04:34.629
Okay. Okay.

05:45.246 --> 05:48.035
Detective Russell.

05:48.102 --> 05:50.081
Your mom's in the bedroom
with your brother.

05:50.154 --> 05:52.069
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.259
Ma.

05:59.329 --> 06:01.222
- What happened, Doug?
- He came at me.

06:01.287 --> 06:04.393
- I told him to back off and he wouldn't.
- It was an accident, Diane.

06:04.463 --> 06:07.569
So I shot him! I'm only sorry
I didn't do it 10 years ago.

06:07.638 --> 06:09.366
We'll get to the bottom of this
at the station house.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.896
But for now,
you both have to be quiet.

06:11.969 --> 06:14.791
- I don't want you to say anything more to anyone.
- Is Dougie going to jail?

06:16.460 --> 06:19.282
I don't know, Ma.
I don't know what's gonna happen.

06:20.502 --> 06:22.996
- Dougie?
- What?

06:23.068 --> 06:26.207
- Dougie, just take it easy, all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

06:31.410 --> 06:33.269
Get him covered up.

06:35.548 --> 06:38.271
- What do we got on this?
- A neighbor called it in.

06:38.339 --> 06:40.613
She told me she heard
some arguing, then a shot.

06:40.681 --> 06:43.053
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

06:43.119 --> 06:45.033
- Just one?
- Looks like one was enough.

06:45.107 --> 06:47.251
Detective Russell's brother
gave me this weapon.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.617
I unloaded it.

06:58.196 --> 07:00.886
- Uh, Shannon, can you give us a second?
- Yeah.

07:00.955 --> 07:03.679
On the statements and so forth,
we can talk about it later on.

07:03.745 --> 07:06.020
- Yeah, Shannon. I'll find you.
- Okay.

07:08.205 --> 07:10.862
- That's my.38.
- You gave it to your brother?

07:10.932 --> 07:12.792
- No, of course not.
- How did he get it?

07:12.857 --> 07:15.164
I don't know. I'm gonna take them down to
the station house and get Dougie a lawyer.

07:15.231 --> 07:17.243
- Yeah.
- They're real confused what happened.

07:17.316 --> 07:19.591
Yeah, okay.
I'll talk to the neighbor.

07:19.657 --> 07:22.446
- Did she already talk to Shannon?
- Yeah.

07:22.513 --> 07:25.302
Listen, get Doug
and your mom ready, okay?

07:29.506 --> 07:32.262
- I'm Detective Simone.
- Maria Blair.

07:32.329 --> 07:34.439
- You, uh, call this in?
- I heard this sound...

07:34.510 --> 07:37.649
and I came over
to see what happened.

07:37.719 --> 07:41.041
- I saw Doug with the gun.
- Did he say anything?

07:41.110 --> 07:43.483
He said he did it.

07:44.928 --> 07:47.783
These are really nice people.
This shouldn't be happening.

08:01.289 --> 08:03.816
Boy, some of these buildings
have a lot of work in them.

08:03.887 --> 08:05.746
What do they call
this part of town?

08:05.812 --> 08:09.618
- Hell's Kitchen.
- Oh, I thought they changed it.

08:09.694 --> 08:12.450
I thought they changed it
to Clinton.

08:12.517 --> 08:15.688
Yeah? Who is it?

08:15.757 --> 08:18.480
- Is it the plumbers?
- No, ma'am. We're New York City Police detectives.

08:18.548 --> 08:20.921
We'd like to speak
to a Mrs. Rivera.

08:20.986 --> 08:23.293
That's me. Eh...

08:23.360 --> 08:26.980
- I'll be right down.
- Not much foliage, huh?

08:27.049 --> 08:29.291
Boy, I bet in the summer
it gets pretty hot.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.568
Yeah. Might be why they call it
Hell's Kitchen.

08:31.637 --> 08:34.229
Mrs. Rivera?
Can we talk inside?

08:34.299 --> 08:37.340
No, I prefer here.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.839
What is it? Did somebody get robbed?
'Cause I didn't see nothing.

08:39.913 --> 08:42.253
No. We wanted to talk to you
about your son, Mrs. Rivera.

08:42.318 --> 08:44.496
Sal?
Do you know where he is?

08:45.526 --> 08:47.386
- Who is it?
- The police detectives.

08:47.451 --> 08:50.393
They wanna know about Salvador.
This is my daughter, Margie.

08:50.467 --> 08:52.381
Sal don't live here no more.

08:52.456 --> 08:54.403
- Do you know where he went, Margie?
- No.

08:54.477 --> 08:57.551
We haven't seen him seven,
maybe eight years.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.563
- Do you know a Rickie Esposito?
- Yeah.

09:00.636 --> 09:03.808
Me and Rickie, we lived together
five or six years.

09:03.876 --> 09:06.753
- Look, what is this about?
- This Rickie is running around...

09:06.828 --> 09:09.005
telling everybody that he killed
your son, Mrs. Rivera.

09:09.073 --> 09:12.310
- Rickie killed Sal?
- Oh, my God.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.324
- That's crazy.
- Why don't you tell us whatever you can remember...

09:14.398 --> 09:16.258
about the last time
you talked to your son?

09:16.323 --> 09:18.817
The last time I talked to Sal...

09:18.890 --> 09:22.095
Rickie was going over to do
some work at his ex-wife's place...

09:22.162 --> 09:25.016
and, uh, Sal went with him.

09:25.081 --> 09:27.476
- I never seen him after that.
- Did you call the police?

09:27.552 --> 09:30.341
Yeah, I called them once.
They said Sal's 19.

09:30.406 --> 09:33.763
- Probably hejust left.
- This ex-wife, uh...

09:33.839 --> 09:36.529
The house that Rickie and him were working
on, do you remember where she lived?

09:36.598 --> 09:41.181
Lisa Gay. She lives on Second and 14th,
across from the projects.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.907
I got her address right here.
You go talk to her.

09:43.976 --> 09:47.367
She'll tell you Rickie would
never do a thing like this.

09:47.441 --> 09:50.580
- Shame on you.
- All right. Would you get the address for us?

09:50.649 --> 09:52.793
Yes, I can get it for you.
Come.

09:53.889 --> 09:56.416
- Let's go.
- Shame on us?

09:56.487 --> 09:58.696
The kid's gone eight years.
She barely even missed him.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.324
Yeah. If he turns up dead,
she'll probably decide we did it.

10:09.031 --> 10:12.902
Mom, Detective Simone's gonna
sit you down and get you a cup of coffee.

10:12.976 --> 10:15.733
- I'll be in in a minute, okay?
- Can't I go with Dougie?

10:15.799 --> 10:18.873
- No, Mom. You can't.
- Mrs. Russell, right this way.

10:18.943 --> 10:21.316
Thanks, Bobby.
Come on, Doug.

10:23.018 --> 10:25.260
In here, Dougie.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.906
All right. I have a call
in toJohn Tedesco.

10:29.978 --> 10:32.800
I don't need a lawyer.
I just wanna get this over with.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.103
- Dougie, you're getting a lawyer.
- Look, I shot him!

10:38.673 --> 10:40.685
- When did you take my gun?
- The day he beat Mom at the bar...

10:40.757 --> 10:42.616
when you gave me the keys
to your apartment.

10:42.682 --> 10:45.821
- You've been carrying the gun around?
- Mom had it.

10:45.890 --> 10:48.351
- Mom?
- I gave it to her for protection...

10:48.424 --> 10:50.634
in case he started
beating her again.

10:50.702 --> 10:52.561
So, today,
when he started in on me...

10:52.627 --> 10:55.317
I went in the bedroom,
and I got it, and I shot him.

10:55.386 --> 10:58.591
Dougie, there had to be
physical violence.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.535
You had to be
defending yourself.

11:01.610 --> 11:04.552
You tell Tedesco you were
defending yourself.

11:04.625 --> 11:07.534
- You hear me?
- Diane, look, I don't need any lawyer!

11:13.576 --> 11:16.200
- How does that look?
- Not so great, Lieu.

11:16.269 --> 11:18.380
Diane's brother
confessed to the neighbor...

11:18.451 --> 11:20.758
plus it turns out that one of
Diane's guns was involved.

11:20.825 --> 11:22.804
- She tell you how that happened?
- I don't think she knows.

11:22.878 --> 11:25.273
Okay. You're gonna
have to notify I.A.B.

11:25.348 --> 11:26.846
Yeah, okay.

11:29.936 --> 11:31.796
- Hey.
- He won't take a lawyer.

11:31.861 --> 11:34.967
- No?
- Could you talk to him, explain why he has to?

11:35.037 --> 11:37.213
- Sure.
- I have to go talk to Shannon.

11:37.282 --> 11:39.392
Shannon asked me to tell you
that he doesn't remember...

11:39.463 --> 11:41.640
what your mom or your brother
were saying at the scene.

11:41.709 --> 11:45.493
They were both confused,
and that's all he knows.

11:45.559 --> 11:47.669
Did Doug tell you how he
laid hands on your weapon?

11:47.740 --> 11:50.747
- He just said he took it.
- We're gonna have to report this to I.A.B.

11:50.819 --> 11:52.679
- Yeah.
- Was it secured?

11:52.744 --> 11:54.636
It's an off-duty weapon.
I had it in the back of my dresser.

11:54.702 --> 11:56.561
You didn't notice
it was missing?

11:56.627 --> 11:59.383
I kept it around in case of prowlers.
I wasn't checking on it every day.

11:59.449 --> 12:01.396
- You want me to tell them that?
- You know, right now...

12:01.470 --> 12:04.894
I don't really care
about losing a week's pay.

12:04.967 --> 12:07.526
A.D.A. Cohen
to see Detective Simone.

12:07.597 --> 12:11.284
Uh, just a moment, please.

12:15.136 --> 12:17.280
- That's the riding D.A.
- Yeah.

12:17.349 --> 12:19.744
Could you hold off on the neighbor's
statement just for a little?

12:19.820 --> 12:22.062
If Dougie's gonna confess, I want that
to be the first thing on paper.

12:22.129 --> 12:23.989
I don't really have
the neighbor's statement yet.

12:26.236 --> 12:28.215
I've gotta make...
burial arrangements.

12:28.288 --> 12:29.699
Okay.

12:29.764 --> 12:33.898
- I'm Bobby Simone.
- Leo Cohen, on the Russell homicide.

12:33.967 --> 12:36.821
- I understand you've got a collar.
- We've got someone in custody.

12:36.887 --> 12:39.610
- You ready for me to take a statement?
- Uh, no.

12:39.678 --> 12:43.779
The, uh, suspect is the brother
of one of our detectives.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.707
Detective Russell.

12:45.772 --> 12:48.233
It was their father
who was shot.

12:48.306 --> 12:50.734
My understanding is Detective Russell's
brother is lawyered up.

12:50.809 --> 12:53.598
- Where are you on witnesses?
- It's not clear.

12:53.664 --> 12:56.322
- It's not?
- The officer on the scene...

12:56.391 --> 12:58.436
said Mrs. Russell was kind
of confused, maybe in shock.

12:58.508 --> 13:00.368
He couldn't really make out
what she was saying.

13:00.433 --> 13:03.507
And he doesn't really recall the son
making any kind of statements at all.

13:03.577 --> 13:05.524
On what basis
was the son collared?

13:05.598 --> 13:08.572
Evidently, the neighbor came over
when she heard the shot...

13:08.646 --> 13:11.018
uh, saw the brother holding
the murder weapon in his hands.

13:11.084 --> 13:13.840
- That's all we got right now.
- You're going on the record with that?

13:13.906 --> 13:16.334
I'm just saying that's
where the case is right now.

13:16.408 --> 13:19.415
Detective Simone,
I'm sure you'll understand.

13:19.489 --> 13:22.081
In light of your leak on
the Stackhouse investigation...

13:22.151 --> 13:25.027
D.A. Abrams isn't president
of your fan club right now.

13:25.102 --> 13:27.279
Oh, he's not president
of my fan club, huh?

13:27.348 --> 13:30.422
My point, Detective-
If I smell anything inappropriate at all...

13:30.491 --> 13:32.919
in your investigation-
any vagueness in your report...

13:32.994 --> 13:34.886
given this is another
officer's family...

13:34.950 --> 13:37.510
my own feelings aside-
I'm gonna have to land hard on you.

13:37.581 --> 13:40.173
And that would be against
your own feelings.

13:42.073 --> 13:44.927
Don't call me till you
get your story straight.

13:58.529 --> 14:02.434
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.
Rickie didn't kill nobody.

14:02.507 --> 14:05.361
- That kid just took off.
- All right. So, where were they working?

14:05.427 --> 14:07.822
Well, they laid some carpet
in there.

14:07.897 --> 14:10.007
But mostly, they put in
this little patio.

14:10.078 --> 14:13.764
Uh-huh.

14:13.832 --> 14:16.522
How much does a place like this go for,
if you don't mind my asking?

14:16.590 --> 14:19.215
I pay 450,
but it's rent-controlled.

14:19.285 --> 14:22.457
- Oh, rent-controlled, huh?
- So even after he divorces you...

14:22.525 --> 14:24.537
this Rickie don't mind coming around
and doing work around the house?

14:24.610 --> 14:27.104
- I told you he's a good guy.
- And this kid, Sal...

14:27.176 --> 14:29.834
- How come he was doing you so many favors?
- Rickie told him to, I guess.

14:29.904 --> 14:32.561
So you watched them
pour the concrete?

14:32.630 --> 14:34.490
No. I was out of town
that weekend.

14:34.555 --> 14:36.895
When I came home, Rickie had
surprised me by doing the job.

14:38.276 --> 14:42.279
Well, uh, I think we may have to
tear up this patio here.

14:42.351 --> 14:44.943
- Oh, no, you're not.
- This is the last place that we can put that kid.

14:45.013 --> 14:47.189
I wanna know
what's underneath there.

14:47.259 --> 14:49.085
You don't know
the boy's down there.

14:49.152 --> 14:51.809
You want us to get a warrant, ma'am?
Absolutely we can do that.

14:51.878 --> 14:54.788
Thing is, if we do find a body,
it's gonna look a lot better for you.

14:54.862 --> 14:57.454
Better for me?
I haven't done anything.

14:57.524 --> 14:59.864
Yeah? I certainly hope
the judge'll see it that way.

14:59.930 --> 15:04.032
Look, Sal was a bad kid.
Nobody misses him.

15:04.100 --> 15:08.038
Why you wanna go tearing up my house
looking for somebody no one wants to find?

15:08.110 --> 15:11.085
Well, Lisa, we got a dead body
growing in your garden.

15:11.158 --> 15:13.465
We wanna dig it up.
We're just kind of wacky that way.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.946
- Hey, Doug.
- You here to take my statement?

15:26.621 --> 15:29.410
You know, Doug,
I agree with your sister.

15:29.475 --> 15:32.899
I think you should have a lawyer
with you before you write any statements.

15:32.972 --> 15:34.886
Look, I shot my father.

15:34.961 --> 15:36.821
Having a lawyer
ain't gonna change that.

15:38.940 --> 15:42.593
- All right. Let's start with an oral statement.
- I shot my father.

15:42.660 --> 15:45.930
Yeah. Could you go back
a little for me?

15:45.996 --> 15:49.135
I went by before work.
I do it every day.

15:49.205 --> 15:51.994
- You'd have breakfast with 'em?
- I have coffee.

15:53.407 --> 15:57.574
So everyone was, uh,
sitting around the table there?

15:57.641 --> 16:00.496
Yeah. More or less.

16:00.561 --> 16:02.573
Well, what happened, Doug?

16:02.647 --> 16:04.659
He started going off on me...

16:04.731 --> 16:07.455
about what a jerk I am,
a failure at work...

16:07.522 --> 16:09.381
a general overall failure.

16:09.447 --> 16:11.874
This was par for the course
in terms of your dad's tone with you?

16:11.949 --> 16:15.953
Pretty much.
But I just got sick of it, you know?

16:16.023 --> 16:18.035
I mean, finally, you just get
so sick of something.

16:18.108 --> 16:21.729
- So I went and I got the gun-
- Your sister's off-duty gun.

16:21.797 --> 16:24.838
So, finally,
I got it in the bedroom...

16:24.909 --> 16:27.917
came back, and I shot him.

16:27.989 --> 16:32.310
Before you went into the bedroom,
what went down between you and your dad?

16:32.384 --> 16:35.873
- Did your dad raise a hand to you?
- Yes.

16:35.945 --> 16:39.849
Doug, if you felt that
your life was in danger...

16:39.923 --> 16:42.198
it is very important to make
that clear, all right?

16:42.264 --> 16:45.371
I felt like I was in danger,
so I got the gun and I shot him.

16:45.441 --> 16:48.798
- You came back into the living room and shot him?
- Yes!

16:48.873 --> 16:51.728
- Was your dad advancing on you?
- Look, man, my dad deserved killing.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.619
But was he advancing on you?

16:53.685 --> 16:55.894
- You want me to write it down?
- No, I don't want you to write it down.

16:55.963 --> 16:57.975
I want you to think about
what you're saying.

16:58.048 --> 17:01.603
I want you to think about it and what your
state of mind was when this happened...

17:01.673 --> 17:05.292
and how important it is to make it clear
that you were frightened.

17:10.270 --> 17:13.124
Then I'll come back
and, uh, we'll talk.

17:21.242 --> 17:25.180
You're sure? All right.
Thanks for checking.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.165
Crime Scene found a bullet
in the wall of the bedroom.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.482
I checked it out with the M.E. To see
if maybe there were two shots fired...

17:29.550 --> 17:32.722
but he says there was just one, so,
apparently, it went right through him.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.131
Diane, you gotta let somebody
else take care of this kind of stuff.

17:35.196 --> 17:37.405
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, huh?

17:37.474 --> 17:41.094
- Don't tell me how I'm feeling right now!
- Okay.

17:41.164 --> 17:45.517
- Bobby, don't make me go home.
- Diane, just take it easy, okay?

17:45.590 --> 17:47.897
- Where is he on the lawyer?
- He don't want one.

17:47.964 --> 17:51.168
- That's ridiculous!
- I let him talk to me a little bit about what happened, and...

17:51.236 --> 17:53.096
- What?
- Diane, it was...

17:53.161 --> 17:56.519
- How could you let him talk to you without a lawyer?
- Diane, it was off the record.

17:57.556 --> 17:58.573
Come here a second.

18:01.983 --> 18:04.991
You gotta listen to me.
Somebody killed your father.

18:05.063 --> 18:07.720
- You think a stranger did that?
- I want my brother to have a lawyer.

18:07.789 --> 18:11.213
Nobody is looking to hurt your brother.
Do you understand that?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.744
I'm not positive
that Doug did it.

18:15.810 --> 18:18.719
And I don't know what the hell
went on in that apartment.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.320
- I need to talk to your mother right now.
- Off the record.

18:22.353 --> 18:24.213
Absolutely.

18:29.507 --> 18:32.034
- So they just found one bullet?
- Yeah.

18:32.106 --> 18:34.895
I guess that means that your dad
was shot in the bedroom...

18:34.960 --> 18:37.005
and must've collapsed
in the living room.

18:37.079 --> 18:40.316
- I guess.
- Well, that doesn't fit what Doug told me.

18:48.947 --> 18:50.839
Mrs. Russell, how you feeling?

18:50.905 --> 18:53.049
Where's Dougie?
Can I see him?

18:53.118 --> 18:57.252
Not just yet. I have a few questions
that I need to ask you.

18:57.321 --> 18:59.563
Diane says I'm not supposed
to talk to anyone.

18:59.630 --> 19:02.933
- She said it would be okay.
- She said it was all right?

19:02.999 --> 19:04.344
Yes, she did.

19:06.848 --> 19:10.687
Mrs. Russell,
I need to ask you...

19:12.527 --> 19:13.511
what happened this morning?

19:13.512 --> 19:14.496
What happened this morning?

19:14.562 --> 19:16.640
I don't remember very much.

19:16.711 --> 19:19.237
It happened so fast.

19:19.309 --> 19:22.383
But I don't think Dougie
meant to shoot anybody.

19:22.453 --> 19:25.658
- I think the gun just went off.
- Where were you when the gun went off?

19:25.726 --> 19:29.280
- We were in the bedroom.
- So this all happened in the bedroom?

19:29.351 --> 19:33.190
- Isn't that what Dougie said?
- I would have to check my notes.

19:33.265 --> 19:36.502
But right now, I'd like to hear
what you remember.

19:36.568 --> 19:38.646
I don't remember anything.
I told you.

19:38.718 --> 19:40.993
It all happened so fast,
it could've happened anywhere.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.644
But you do recall it
happening in the bedroom?

19:47.058 --> 19:48.973
Dougie remembers
better than I would.

19:50.202 --> 19:52.346
Nobody's looking
to trap you here.

19:52.416 --> 19:54.811
Nobody's looking to hurt you.
But you can hurt yourself.

19:54.886 --> 19:57.927
You can hurt other people
in your family by telling half-truths.

20:01.237 --> 20:04.027
I don't remember
exactly how it happened.

20:04.093 --> 20:06.882
- It was all so confusing.
- I understand that.

20:06.948 --> 20:10.635
I just know
Dougie didn't mean to do it.

20:10.702 --> 20:13.458
- Your husband and Doug, they were arguing?
- Yes.

20:13.525 --> 20:18.775
I don't think arguing so much as Pete
would tease and hurt Dougie's feelings.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.442
Would he do more
than just tease?

20:21.512 --> 20:23.372
Would they ever get physical
with each other?

20:23.437 --> 20:27.604
See, I'm thinking specifically
if Doug was afraid this morning.

20:27.672 --> 20:31.029
- I think he could've been.
- You think he was afraid for his life?

20:34.119 --> 20:36.329
Could I see Diane?
I think Diane should be here.

20:38.098 --> 20:40.822
Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'll get Diane.

20:40.889 --> 20:42.967
She'll come in here
and she'll take care of you.

20:44.835 --> 20:47.624
And then I'm gonna go back
and talk to your neighbor.

20:47.689 --> 20:51.244
- Maria?
- Maria Blair, right.

20:52.438 --> 20:54.297
Maria's a lovely girl.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.554
I'll go get Diane.

21:05.751 --> 21:09.305
- What color fish you got?
- They come in all different colors.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.482
There's nice yellow ones,
and they're different types.

21:12.552 --> 21:14.411
This is Dr. Laura Schiller.

21:14.477 --> 21:17.616
She's the anthropologist from N.Y.U.
That the M.E. Recommended.

21:17.684 --> 21:19.477
- You're the bone expert, huh?
- That's me.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.884
We've got some bones we've been
digging up from under that patio.

21:21.951 --> 21:25.275
- We need you to identify 'em.
- Do you suspect foul play?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.298
Yeah, well, we always
suspect foul play.

21:27.372 --> 21:29.745
It's kind of our job.

21:29.810 --> 21:32.851
- You recognize any of these?
- Yeah, sure.

21:38.696 --> 21:40.643
This is a pork chop.

21:42.482 --> 21:46.386
Rib eye steak, ham bone.

21:46.460 --> 21:48.406
And this looks like ribs.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.871
- Those aren't human remains?
- Sorry, Detective.

21:51.945 --> 21:53.892
What you have here is
the remains of a barbecue.

21:53.966 --> 21:56.044
I told you that boy
was not under there.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.320
- None of them are human bones?
- Those are animal bones.

21:59.388 --> 22:01.247
It looks like
a garbage dump of some sort.

22:01.313 --> 22:03.172
Did you used to dump
your garbage here?

22:03.237 --> 22:07.558
That's where I used to keep my cans
before Rickie built me this patio.

22:07.632 --> 22:10.159
You're gonna put it back, aren't you?

22:10.231 --> 22:12.955
What the hell kind of
cadaver dog is this, huh?

22:13.022 --> 22:15.199
He can't tell the difference
between a steak and a human being?

22:15.267 --> 22:17.247
- There's a lot of bones here. He got confused.
- Yeah.

22:17.321 --> 22:20.328
So what happens when you pass a deli?
He finds bodies in there too?

22:20.400 --> 22:23.604
- Look, he's a dog.
- Which is why I own fish.

22:23.672 --> 22:27.226
- Zeus!
- Oh, now, this genius. Now what? Come on.

22:27.297 --> 22:29.637
Get the hell out.
He's always makin'a mess.

22:31.853 --> 22:33.898
Hold on. We got something. Good boy.

22:36.696 --> 22:40.535
- It's a carpet.
- Something's rolled up in a carpet.

22:48.021 --> 22:51.258
Hello, Sal.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.699
- Hi.
- Oh. You're back?

23:16.764 --> 23:18.908
Yeah. I wanted to get
some more details from you...

23:18.978 --> 23:21.188
Miss Blair,
about what happened this morning.

23:21.256 --> 23:24.526
I heard the shot,
I went over there, I called 911.

23:24.592 --> 23:28.376
- That's really all I have to say.
- I'll tell you what.

23:29.724 --> 23:33.148
Why don't you come in here
with me to the crime scene and...

23:33.221 --> 23:35.135
You know, maybe you can help me
piece the sequence together.

23:44.064 --> 23:46.273
- I'm not involved in this.
- I understand that.

23:48.106 --> 23:51.463
You were just trying to help.
I gotta tell you...

23:51.539 --> 23:53.814
you going towards an apartment
where a gunshot had just gone off...

23:53.880 --> 23:56.757
I- I really admire your courage,
your doing that.

23:57.730 --> 24:00.771
Well, I gave my statement.

24:02.061 --> 24:03.920
You know what
I had to ask you?

24:03.986 --> 24:06.260
Who was it that opened
the door here for you?

24:06.328 --> 24:08.723
- Doug did.
- When he opened the door, he had the gun?

24:08.798 --> 24:10.460
- I think so.
- And you weren't frightened?

24:10.530 --> 24:12.510
Look, Doug's a really nice guy.

24:12.583 --> 24:15.459
If he shot his dad,
I'm sure it was an accident.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.898
Thanks for the opinion.

24:18.967 --> 24:21.340
So he had the gun in his hand,
and you weren't frightened?

24:21.405 --> 24:23.264
He said he'd shot his father.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.189
I called 911, and that's all.

24:25.255 --> 24:29.421
Did you, uh, dial 911
from the bedroom?

24:29.489 --> 24:32.365
- I guess.
- You guess?

24:32.440 --> 24:35.481
Could you come in here
for a minute, Miss Blair?

24:35.552 --> 24:38.079
See, otherwise, you would've had to
step over the body...

24:38.150 --> 24:40.064
and you would've been
a couple of feet away...

24:40.139 --> 24:41.999
from Mr. Russell if you would have
dialed from right out here.

24:42.064 --> 24:46.330
- Then I called from in there.
- Mrs. Russell was in the bedroom?

24:48.095 --> 24:51.136
- How was she acting? Do you remember?
- She was very upset.

24:51.207 --> 24:54.281
You know, I don't remember exactly.
I don't like this attitude.

24:54.351 --> 24:57.490
What's wrong with my attitude, Miss Blair?
I'm investigating a homicide.

24:57.559 --> 25:00.730
You're pushing at me.
You're treating me like I'm a suspect.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.778
Well, I gotta tell you,
that's what I do for a living.

25:02.852 --> 25:04.712
Let me tell you
something else.

25:04.777 --> 25:07.916
There's something very wrong with all
the stories that I'm getting on this case.

25:07.984 --> 25:10.774
Now, you could have
the best reason in the world.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.984
If you are covering up
the truth...

25:13.053 --> 25:15.098
that still makes you
an accomplice to a murder.

25:15.171 --> 25:17.315
I am not an accomplice
to anything.

25:17.384 --> 25:19.299
Well, that's how
you're coming off.

25:23.512 --> 25:25.371
So?

25:30.473 --> 25:32.387
I heard the gunshot.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.144
I came out into the hall...

25:36.215 --> 25:39.124
and he was just
coming up the steps.

25:39.198 --> 25:41.790
Doug?

25:41.861 --> 25:44.585
He opened the door
from the outside with his key...

25:47.154 --> 25:52.535
and Mrs. Russell was there,
and the gun was on the floor.

25:52.608 --> 25:55.298
She was in a panic.
She said she didn't know how it happened.

25:55.367 --> 25:57.226
Doug said he'd take care of it...

25:57.291 --> 26:00.332
and he told me that we had
to tell everyone that he did it.

26:00.404 --> 26:04.637
- And you went along with that?
- I've watched him 12 years trying to help.

26:04.702 --> 26:07.327
He helped my mom
when she was alive.

26:07.397 --> 26:09.792
He was trying to help his mom.

26:09.867 --> 26:13.323
I thought he was making a mistake
by saying he'd done it.

26:13.395 --> 26:19.039
But he asked me to help.
It's what I tried to do.

26:24.495 --> 26:27.087
So he's got the kid rolled up
in an old piece of carpet...

26:27.157 --> 26:29.498
buried lengthwise in a hole.

26:29.564 --> 26:32.025
Bones collapsed
on top of themselves.

26:32.098 --> 26:34.690
- Any luck on dental records?
- No. We just started the search.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.998
Plus there was some personalized
jewelry and a belt buckle.

26:38.065 --> 26:40.526
Medavoy's got the sister
looking at the stuff right now.

26:43.326 --> 26:45.240
Do you know about Diane?

26:46.855 --> 26:49.415
Yeah.

27:03.376 --> 27:05.235
I'm sorry about what happened.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.215
Thanks.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.914
- You wanna take a walk?
- No. L...

27:09.984 --> 27:14.469
I- I have to make arrangements.
Bobby's out talking to a neighbor.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.814
I need to be here
if something develops.

27:16.882 --> 27:20.305
- Are you working the case?
- I have to be here, Andy.

27:22.752 --> 27:25.246
You wanna look out for
your mother and your brother...

27:25.318 --> 27:28.195
but you gotta make room
for yourself in this.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.348
- I know.
- You need to get out of here.

27:30.419 --> 27:32.016
Take a walk.
Go to a meeting.

27:32.088 --> 27:34.582
Find a place to put
what's going on inside.

27:34.654 --> 27:38.045
'Cause if you don't,
I guarantee you...

27:38.118 --> 27:40.743
you may think you're
on top of this now...

27:40.813 --> 27:43.689
but sooner or later,
you're gonna reach out for that bottle.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.706
I'm scared, Andy.

27:55.345 --> 27:57.259
I want a drink real bad.

28:03.686 --> 28:06.376
You wanna take a walk?

28:06.445 --> 28:08.817
- You'll come with me?
- Yeah.

28:28.066 --> 28:31.873
Yeah, this was Sal's stuff.

28:31.948 --> 28:36.783
Is there a chance that Sal could've
sold the jewelry or given it away?

28:36.857 --> 28:40.248
I don't think so.
Can I take these with me?

28:40.321 --> 28:42.180
Not yet.

28:42.245 --> 28:45.220
As soon as we get a positive
I.D. On Sal's dental records...

28:45.293 --> 28:47.918
then we'll release his effects.

28:52.287 --> 28:57.350
Look, if Rickie said he killed Sal,
that's probably what happened.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.466
Why would Rickie
have killed Sal, Margie?

29:01.526 --> 29:03.735
Because of somethin'
I told him.

29:03.804 --> 29:07.391
Sal and me.
He was doin' it to me.

29:07.461 --> 29:10.217
Your brother
was sexually abusing you?

29:10.284 --> 29:12.974
He was sleeping with me.

29:15.384 --> 29:21.115
- How old were you?
- When we started, maybe 11.

29:22.410 --> 29:26.162
We was doin' it for a long time.
Three years about.

29:26.227 --> 29:30.646
- And you told that to Rickie?
- Yeah.

29:30.718 --> 29:33.759
I didn't tell anybody before because
I didn't want Sal to get in trouble.

29:33.830 --> 29:38.664
Then I found out he was
screwing our little sister too.

29:38.738 --> 29:42.424
I was just, Forget about it."
I thought he was gonna lose it.

29:43.775 --> 29:48.456
- What did Rickie do?
- He just said he'd take care of it.

29:48.523 --> 29:50.765
About a week later, Sal left.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.205
I mean,
that's what we thought.

29:53.270 --> 29:55.130
I guess that's
not what happened.

29:55.195 --> 29:59.516
- No. No, it isn't.
- You gonna arrest Rickie?

29:59.590 --> 30:03.560
- Yeah.
- Good.

30:05.108 --> 30:07.602
I mean, I didn't want Sal
to get killed.

30:08.829 --> 30:12.034
I was just mad at him
'cause he was two-timing me.

30:13.449 --> 30:18.218
- Two-timing?
- I just told you. With my sister.

30:19.864 --> 30:22.621
By sleeping with your sister,
that was two-timing?

30:23.682 --> 30:26.821
Yeah. Sick, huh?

30:29.681 --> 30:32.984
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Thanks, Andy.

30:33.050 --> 30:35.292
- I have to talk to Bobby, okay?
- Yeah.

30:35.359 --> 30:37.404
I gotta go pick up
a perp with Medavoy.

30:37.477 --> 30:40.518
- Thanks, Andy.
- Diane?

30:40.588 --> 30:42.448
- Did you take a statement from the neighbor?
- Yeah.

30:42.513 --> 30:44.755
How much did she see?

30:46.138 --> 30:48.053
Doug wasn't even there when
the shooting happened, Diane.

30:48.127 --> 30:51.780
The neighbor heard the shot
from inside your parents' apartment.

30:51.848 --> 30:54.987
She opens up her door,
she sees Doug coming up the stairs.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.776
It was your mom
who shot your dad.

31:00.991 --> 31:03.418
I'm sorry.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.215
Your brother talked the neighbor
into going along with saying he did it.

31:11.289 --> 31:14.165
Look, I can get
your mom to flip.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.580
If she goes, I think Doug'll
change his statement.

31:17.961 --> 31:20.618
I have to do it.

31:20.688 --> 31:25.271
- Bobby-
- Okay.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.162
Thanks. Will you square it
with Fancy?

31:28.227 --> 31:32.131
Yeah. He never said you
couldn't talk to your own mother.

31:32.205 --> 31:34.632
Okay.

31:40.641 --> 31:43.233
Diane.

31:45.165 --> 31:47.057
Hi, Mom.

31:47.122 --> 31:49.495
I sure would like
to see Dougie.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.419
They've had me in here
for quite a while.

31:51.484 --> 31:54.940
We're, uh, trying to get
to the bottom of this.

31:55.014 --> 31:56.928
- It takes time.
- I don't know why.

31:57.002 --> 32:02.000
- We told you what happened.
- What you told us wasn't true, was it?

32:02.070 --> 32:04.728
Why would you say that?

32:04.798 --> 32:08.965
Detective Simone talked
to Maria across the hall, Mom.

32:09.032 --> 32:13.199
She says Dougie wasn't even there
when she heard that shot.

32:13.266 --> 32:15.181
How would she know?
She didn't see it.

32:15.256 --> 32:17.782
She says she saw Dougie
coming up the stairs...

32:17.854 --> 32:20.414
after the shot went off
inside the apartment.

32:20.485 --> 32:23.241
And then Doug and her came over,
saw what had happened...

32:23.308 --> 32:25.222
Well, that's not true.

32:27.959 --> 32:32.640
Dougie is going to jail
for a very long time...

32:32.707 --> 32:34.622
if you don't tell the truth
about what happened.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.216
You can help Dougie.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.848
That one time,
when your dad tore up that bar...

32:40.919 --> 32:42.778
you fixed that right away.

32:42.844 --> 32:45.851
- This is different.
- Why?

32:48.426 --> 32:50.340
Mom...

32:52.757 --> 32:54.835
Mom, it's all right.

32:56.317 --> 32:58.811
If we can just talk about
what actually happened...

32:58.884 --> 33:00.744
I know we can
get through this.

33:01.996 --> 33:03.910
I don't think we can.

33:03.985 --> 33:08.273
Otherwise, it's gonna destroy your life,
it's gonna destroy Dougie's life.

33:09.791 --> 33:11.650
But it was Doug's idea.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.301
What was Doug's idea?

33:19.062 --> 33:21.435
It just happened so fast.

33:22.688 --> 33:24.602
I don't even remember
picking up the gun.

33:26.986 --> 33:29.545
And then your father
was Iying there...

33:29.617 --> 33:32.438
and Doug came in and said
he'd take care of it.

33:32.504 --> 33:35.161
What happened, Mom?

33:36.898 --> 33:39.482
You and Daddy had a fight.

33:43.139 --> 33:45.764
I found a beer bottle
under... the bed.

33:45.834 --> 33:50.285
- What was that doing there?
- He was gonna hit me with it.

33:52.730 --> 33:58.440
He said he was gonna beat
my half a brain out of my head.

34:00.623 --> 34:03.499
Oh, Mom.

34:12.556 --> 34:16.210
You know, this has been an interesting case
for me today, given my housing situation.

34:16.277 --> 34:19.382
You think about it. We've been
in a lot of different locations.

34:19.453 --> 34:21.344
Finding that body in the backyard
didn't make you think...

34:21.409 --> 34:23.587
about getting back
to your wife, huh, Medavoy?

34:23.656 --> 34:27.495
Yeah, I go back to my wife,
that'll be me someday.

34:27.570 --> 34:30.993
Which makes you ponder, you know, how many
undiscovered bodies there may be out there.

34:31.067 --> 34:35.036
That, uh, Lisa Gay
said number 421/2.

34:35.108 --> 34:37.350
- You see any numbers anywhere?
- I don't see anything.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.453
- Wanna try up here?
- What's this?

34:41.524 --> 34:43.985
Somebody's in there, Andy.

34:44.058 --> 34:45.918
- Stop it!
- They're in trouble! Come on!

34:45.983 --> 34:50.085
- Police!
- Stop it, please!

34:50.154 --> 34:52.429
- I said shut up!
- Somebody help me, please!

34:52.495 --> 34:55.219
Get her, Medavoy!
Pull her down!

34:55.286 --> 34:57.976
- Rickie Esposito?
- That's him!

34:58.045 --> 35:00.418
- Rickie Esposito, you're under arrest!
- What for?

35:00.483 --> 35:03.458
- He was trying to kill me.
- For that! Come on!

35:03.531 --> 35:05.904
- Just try and stay calm, okay?
- Let's go.

35:05.968 --> 35:07.663
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

35:19.410 --> 35:23.544
Detective Simone, my mother
would like to make a statement.

35:23.613 --> 35:27.419
- It's different than I said this morning.
- That's all right, Mrs. Russell...

35:27.494 --> 35:29.353
as long as it's the truth.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.431
After I write down
what happened, can I see my son?

35:31.504 --> 35:33.297
Sure, you can.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.542
You sure you want your mom
to write all this down?

35:35.610 --> 35:38.465
Yes. I'm gonna go
talk to my brother.

35:38.530 --> 35:40.390
I'm gonna wash my face
and go talk to him.

35:41.770 --> 35:44.264
- Donna, is the coffee room open?
- Yeah.

35:44.336 --> 35:46.546
I don't know why you're arresting me.
It was her idea.

35:46.614 --> 35:49.403
- She wanted to kill herself.
- He was trying to murder me like he did that Rivera kid.

35:49.469 --> 35:51.810
- Shut up!
- Watch your mouth.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.767
That Lisa Gay called and said
you all found that man's bones!

35:53.832 --> 35:56.326
- I don't know what she's talking about.
- Shut up.

35:56.398 --> 35:59.538
It's all right.

36:14.972 --> 36:18.363
The truth, huh?
It never occurred to her to say it.

36:19.624 --> 36:23.178
I walk in.
It never occurs to me to ask.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.187
I'm a detective.
I stood that beer bottle up...

36:27.259 --> 36:30.497
and it never occurred to me
to- to push her...

36:30.563 --> 36:32.422
that that's what went down.

36:34.798 --> 36:38.189
Now I gotta go to my brother,
and it'll never occur to Dougie that...

36:39.289 --> 36:41.662
that he should just
say what happened.

36:45.769 --> 36:48.361
I guess we're all so crazy.

36:48.432 --> 36:51.090
Come on.
Nobody's crazy.

36:56.195 --> 36:58.109
Yeah, right.

37:00.846 --> 37:03.219
You want me to go in there
and talk to Doug?

37:04.856 --> 37:06.771
I have to.

37:08.931 --> 37:12.322
That's 'cause you got a world of guts
and you love your brother.

37:27.890 --> 37:30.417
Hey, Di.

37:32.093 --> 37:34.816
- What are you doing in there?
- There was a cop sitting with me...

37:34.884 --> 37:37.706
but he had to go
and do something.

37:37.771 --> 37:40.330
What the hell did he put you
in the cage for?

37:40.401 --> 37:43.311
I don't know.

37:50.378 --> 37:54.545
Dougie,
Mom's making a statement.

37:54.612 --> 37:57.467
We know you didn't shoot Daddy.

37:57.531 --> 38:00.506
She's- She's just trying
to take the weight for me.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.471
Maria told what happened.

38:04.140 --> 38:07.017
He was coming at her
with a beer bottle.

38:07.092 --> 38:10.898
With Dad's history of abuse, there's
a chance Mom won't even go tojail.

38:14.758 --> 38:17.613
- I'm the one responsible for this.
- No.

38:17.678 --> 38:20.685
I did it, Di.
I did it.

38:20.758 --> 38:22.551
I just didn't have the guts
to pull the trigger.

38:22.618 --> 38:26.785
You gave Mom my gun
because Daddy was hurting her...

38:26.853 --> 38:28.712
and you thought
she needed protection.

38:28.778 --> 38:31.403
- I thought you wanted the truth.
- I'm talking about the truth.

38:31.472 --> 38:34.228
I gave Mom the gun
to do what I wanted.

38:34.295 --> 38:36.887
If she didn't have that gun,
is there any way she would've done it?

38:38.241 --> 38:40.101
I wanted him dead.

38:42.475 --> 38:46.894
- Did you know I had the gun?
- No.

38:50.143 --> 38:52.057
Then it's just me.

38:54.698 --> 38:56.612
No, it's not.

38:59.318 --> 39:01.330
I left you there
all those years.

39:03.873 --> 39:06.082
And I have to live
with leaving you there...

39:06.151 --> 39:08.065
and you have to live
with wanting him dead.

39:08.139 --> 39:10.414
But, Dougie,
you didn't kill him.

39:10.481 --> 39:12.909
You have to fight.

39:17.506 --> 39:19.365
I want my brother.

39:22.382 --> 39:24.297
I feel so sick.

39:29.184 --> 39:31.098
I've never
been strong like you.

39:33.258 --> 39:35.500
Come on.

39:35.568 --> 39:37.427
Come out of there.

39:47.373 --> 39:49.998
I can't see Mom right now.

39:50.068 --> 39:52.944
All right. You go home
and you do what you need to do.

40:03.894 --> 40:06.322
Hey.

40:06.396 --> 40:09.021
- You cleared that homicide?
- Yeah.

40:09.091 --> 40:12.547
I'm gonna put this one up for
America's Most Ancient Cases."

40:12.619 --> 40:15.179
The guy admits he buried
the kid under the patio.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.109
The rest of it was an accident.

40:17.175 --> 40:19.154
He accidentally clobbered
the kid with a baseball bat.

40:19.228 --> 40:21.437
And he was trying to kill
the current wife?

40:21.506 --> 40:23.933
Yeah, that could count
against him too.

40:25.163 --> 40:27.788
- Some family, huh?
- Yeah.

40:29.718 --> 40:32.988
- It was her mom, huh?
- Yeah.

40:34.723 --> 40:36.932
Diane actually closed the case out.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.237
- She got her mom to give it up.
- Good for her.

40:42.935 --> 40:45.144
I got the D.A.
Waiting for me out there.

40:45.213 --> 40:47.936
Some guy named Cohen.

40:48.004 --> 40:51.077
I wanna see if we can
defer arrest on Mrs. Russell.

40:51.148 --> 40:53.007
But this guy's
in Abrams's pocket.

40:53.072 --> 40:56.179
Abrams owes you so many favors.

41:07.412 --> 41:11.066
- I was just reading your new
perpetrator's statement. - Mm-hmm.

41:11.133 --> 41:13.025
There's an extensive history
of spousal abuse...

41:13.090 --> 41:15.267
and the husband was coming
at her with a beer bottle.

41:15.335 --> 41:18.824
Yeah, that's all right here.
Looks like man two or involuntary.

41:18.897 --> 41:22.200
You really think that
the grand jury will indict?

41:22.264 --> 41:24.474
I know we're gonna
give them the chance.

41:24.542 --> 41:27.331
I'm wondering if we could defer arrest
until you see if that happens.

41:27.398 --> 41:30.537
Because the woman's related
to a detective in this squad?

41:30.606 --> 41:33.198
No. Because with the circumstances
of this homicide...

41:33.268 --> 41:36.822
and the woman's voluntary confession
and her age and history...

41:36.894 --> 41:39.289
you got some leeway not to
put her in the system just now.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.988
Look, with no witnesses,
we're not even sure this was self-defense.

41:42.058 --> 41:44.650
- The weapon was recovered.
- An unbroken beer bottle.

41:44.721 --> 41:46.766
Hey, we're talking about
whether this woman...

41:46.838 --> 41:49.495
needs to be in the system
before the grand jury gets the case.

41:49.564 --> 41:51.577
And both of us know
that she can walk...

41:51.650 --> 41:54.953
unless you're looking
to kiss your boss's ass.

41:56.622 --> 41:58.930
Excuse me.

42:02.236 --> 42:04.445
Tell your girlfriend
she can take her mother home.

42:12.822 --> 42:14.682
Let's go.

42:23.441 --> 42:27.127
- What happens now?
- Next week you'll go before the grand jury...

42:27.195 --> 42:29.754
and they'll decide whether or not
they're gonna charge you.

42:29.825 --> 42:32.002
Am I going to jail?

42:32.070 --> 42:34.345
We're gonna take that
one step at a time, Mom.

42:34.412 --> 42:36.457
- And Doug's gonna be all right?
- Mm-hmm.

42:36.529 --> 42:40.018
- He's waiting for us at his place.
- Here you go, Mrs. Russell.

42:40.090 --> 42:42.267
Thank you.

42:42.336 --> 42:44.764
You work with
nice people, Diane.

42:46.763 --> 42:49.158
Detective Simone isn't just
someone I work with, Mom.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.377
We've been seeing each other.

42:53.403 --> 42:57.505
- I'm in love with him.
- Good.

42:59.659 --> 43:01.574
He seems like a good person.

43:03.572 --> 43:06.810
- He is.
- Good night.

43:10.983 --> 43:12.843
I'll call you
in a couple hours.

43:12.908 --> 43:14.822
Okay.

43:15.305 --> 43:21.573
