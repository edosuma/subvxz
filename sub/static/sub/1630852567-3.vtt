WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:03.131
<i>I'm off to work.</i>

00:03.166 --> 00:04.399
Do they even know
you're back?

00:04.434 --> 00:06.296
I'm also going to be looking
for personal support workers.

00:06.331 --> 00:07.397
Excuse me,
do I get a say here?

00:07.432 --> 00:09.263
Hey, Mac, shouldn't you
be at your morning debrief

00:09.298 --> 00:11.065
with uh, Staff Sergeant Waylen?
- The outcome was good.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.758
Nobody got hurt.
- Dr. Thompson,

00:12.793 --> 00:16.032
I am Jenny Cooper.
You've been filling in for me?

00:16.067 --> 00:17.725
Nice of you to drop by,
Dr. Cooper.

00:17.760 --> 00:19.461
I lost my daughter.

00:19.496 --> 00:21.626
Yeah, you lost Katie,

00:22.661 --> 00:24.428
but you left... me.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.824
<i>You think you can
kill me?</i>

00:27.859 --> 00:30.164
<i>Nobody gets the jump on me.
I'm the superhero.</i>

00:30.199 --> 00:32.131
Damn straight.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.461
I don't need a debrief.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.428
<i>Kamusta, Dr. Cooper!</i>

01:15.232 --> 01:16.692
Come on in, Rizal.

01:16.727 --> 01:18.659
Dad's still sleeping.

01:18.694 --> 01:21.791
- Beautiful house!
- Oh, thank you.

01:21.826 --> 01:25.791
Okay, here is a list of meds,
contraindications,

01:25.826 --> 01:28.164
you know, favourite TV shows,
things like that.

01:28.199 --> 01:29.758
Peggy will fill you in
on the rest.

01:29.793 --> 01:31.494
I've gotta run upstairs
and get ready for work.

01:31.529 --> 01:33.197
Peggy?
Does she live here as well?

01:33.232 --> 01:35.461
Uh... uh, sort of.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.098
Yeah, for now.
Just temporarily.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.857
She's a PSW?

01:38.892 --> 01:42.395
Uh no, she is my mother,
technically.

01:42.430 --> 01:44.857
Your dad's ex-wife?

01:44.892 --> 01:46.197
Uh, they're still married,
it's just,

01:46.232 --> 01:49.164
it's a very long story.
But um...

01:49.199 --> 01:50.659
Jenny, could-could
I have a word?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.692
Yes. Mm-hmm.

01:53.892 --> 01:56.626
Hey, this is not the PSW
that I suggested.

01:56.661 --> 01:58.560
Yeah, I went with Rizal.
He's got tons of experience

01:58.595 --> 02:00.725
with Lewy Body dementia,
so he knows what to expect.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.560
Well, we could've
discussed this.

02:02.595 --> 02:05.494
We did discuss it and then,
I made a decision.

02:08.892 --> 02:11.626
Ross was out all night,
again.

02:11.661 --> 02:13.428
Do-do you know his boyfriend?

02:13.463 --> 02:15.164
Ross and his boyfriend
broke up.

02:15.199 --> 02:16.791
So, he was with a stranger.

02:16.826 --> 02:19.230
As his moth--
- Okay, Peggy...

02:19.265 --> 02:21.230
Peggy, okay, look,
I appreciate everything

02:21.265 --> 02:23.461
you did for us, okay.
You uprooted your life,

02:23.496 --> 02:25.593
but you don't have to do that
anymore because I am home.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.362
Rizal is here to help.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.725
Okay, we can take things
a little slower.

02:34.232 --> 02:35.923
- Oh.
- Hey, kiddo.

02:35.958 --> 02:39.494
Have a good night last night?
- Yes.

02:39.529 --> 02:41.593
- Great.
- And a good morning.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.527
Fabulous.

02:45.265 --> 02:47.197
Rizal...
make yourself at home.

02:47.232 --> 02:48.890
Peggy.

02:48.925 --> 02:50.263
Then I guess I'll have
to pack.

03:01.826 --> 03:03.461
Go for it!

04:07.331 --> 04:08.560
Hey, I'm the coroner.

04:26.331 --> 04:27.692
<i>Please!</i>

04:27.727 --> 04:29.395
Hi.

04:29.430 --> 04:31.428
Thank you.

04:33.562 --> 04:35.428
I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:35.463 --> 04:37.296
It was unexpected.

04:37.331 --> 04:39.989
It often is. May I?

04:40.024 --> 04:42.230
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

04:43.496 --> 04:45.791
Helen, coroner's here.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.362
Come on, let's let her
do her job.

04:49.430 --> 04:51.461
Don't pretend like Mom
went peacefully in her sleep.

04:51.496 --> 04:53.461
She was murdered.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.989
Let's try to figure out
what happened, okay?

05:29.024 --> 05:32.593
Um, did your mother
have any health issues?

05:32.628 --> 05:34.626
That's not what's
happening here.

05:36.024 --> 05:38.758
Asians are being randomly
attacked daily in this city.

05:38.793 --> 05:40.725
An 80-year-old grandfather
was hit with a cement brick

05:40.760 --> 05:42.428
while shopping for broccoli.

05:42.463 --> 05:44.527
Broccoli!

05:44.562 --> 05:46.560
If I was there,
I would've done something.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.791
I understand that.

05:51.024 --> 05:52.956
If you guys wouldn't mind
answering my question

05:52.991 --> 05:54.824
about your mother.

05:55.925 --> 05:57.824
<i>Well, the kids say she's
a pillar of health.</i>

05:57.859 --> 06:00.560
She didn't even take any
medications.

06:00.595 --> 06:03.791
So sad.
Reminds me of my Lola.

06:03.826 --> 06:05.857
Healthy 'til the day
she dropped.

06:05.892 --> 06:08.428
That's when everyone else
started fighting

06:08.463 --> 06:09.989
about her money.
- Hmm.

06:10.024 --> 06:12.527
Kids seem pretty close to her.

06:13.727 --> 06:15.560
<i>Mom worked tirelessly.</i>

06:15.595 --> 06:17.428
It broke her heart when
we had to sell our place

06:17.463 --> 06:19.329
in East Chinatown.

06:19.364 --> 06:21.890
I stayed on with the family biz
and Helen moved on.

06:21.925 --> 06:23.791
<i>I thought Mom
would be upset</i>

06:23.826 --> 06:25.890
<i>when I started apprenticing
with a carpenter,</i>

06:25.925 --> 06:27.692
<i>but she totally got it.</i>

06:27.727 --> 06:30.824
Hmm. And who is gonna
run the business now?

06:30.859 --> 06:32.791
The restaurant's in the hole.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.857
The only value is the land
that it's on.

06:34.892 --> 06:37.098
Which we would split
if we sold.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.692
But we won't. Not to that
real estate vulture.

06:39.727 --> 06:41.956
Oh, the Randy Groat guy?

06:43.562 --> 06:45.626
Groat is GOAT? Yeah.

06:45.661 --> 06:47.626
I see his signs everywhere.

06:47.661 --> 06:50.999
- Yeah, he's not subtle.
- No, he's not.

06:59.067 --> 07:02.098
Well, there doesn't seem
to be any financial motive.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.560
There's no visible injuries
on the body.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.857
You think the kids
are in denial?

07:07.892 --> 07:09.890
So caught up in their grief
they're claiming murder?

07:11.133 --> 07:12.989
There's a good chance
it's a heart attack.

07:13.024 --> 07:15.098
It's more common in women
than we realize.

07:15.133 --> 07:17.428
I'll check for recent
onset myocarditis.

07:45.199 --> 07:46.758
Okay, walk me through
your version of events

07:46.793 --> 07:48.164
at the pharmacy, Donovan.

07:48.199 --> 07:50.494
Well, textbook de-escalation.

07:50.529 --> 07:52.758
I assessed the situation.
I was in full control.

07:59.463 --> 08:00.560
<i>So, you had
a plan.</i>

08:00.595 --> 08:02.164
Yes.

08:02.199 --> 08:03.989
Which you communicated
with your partner?

08:04.024 --> 08:06.494
There wasn't time.
But I had his back

08:06.529 --> 08:08.032
and he had mine.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.923
That's not what
Detective Abed said

08:09.958 --> 08:11.923
in his report to Professional
Standards.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.560
<i>Malik?</i>

08:32.595 --> 08:34.725
What'd he say?

09:05.859 --> 09:07.626
- I'll see you back there?
- Yeah.

09:08.892 --> 09:11.131
What happened? Who died?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.824
Uh, Ms. Chan, unfortunately.

09:12.859 --> 09:14.230
Did you know her?

09:14.265 --> 09:16.230
Oh! What?

09:16.265 --> 09:18.131
Mrs. Chan died.
- Oh.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.197
I thought she'd live forever;
she was like Teflon.

09:20.232 --> 09:22.098
How did it happen?

09:22.133 --> 09:23.758
Do we need to beef up security
around here?

09:23.793 --> 09:25.824
Uh, we're still looking
into it.

09:25.859 --> 09:27.989
Well, if there is anything we
can do to help, I am Jason.

09:28.024 --> 09:30.131
Mason, offer some grub
to the uh, coroner, here.

09:30.166 --> 09:32.131
- Um...
- Uh, this is a Chinese

09:32.166 --> 09:34.956
chop suey slider that is vegan,
like our entire menu.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.791
Enjoy the taste of cultural
appropriation.

09:38.199 --> 09:39.890
I'm good, thank you.

09:43.232 --> 09:45.494
All right, I'm gonna head
to the autopsy.

09:45.529 --> 09:46.956
Can I show you
something first?

09:46.991 --> 09:48.593
Yeah, of course.

09:49.793 --> 09:52.659
Mommy, tell us what happened
when you left Trinidad.

09:52.694 --> 09:55.824
I came with a old,
blue suitcase and $100 TT.

09:57.067 --> 09:59.956
- What?
- That's only $43.65 Canadian.

10:01.166 --> 10:03.758
Cousin Winston had
the butcher shop

10:03.793 --> 10:05.890
down the street,
on Broadview,

10:05.925 --> 10:08.164
and the wife's family
was around the corner

10:08.199 --> 10:09.989
selling odds and sods.

10:10.024 --> 10:12.890
We knew everybody.
Everybody knew us.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.890
We looked out for each other.

10:16.925 --> 10:19.791
There was recession, SARS.

10:19.826 --> 10:21.758
People stopped coming.

10:21.793 --> 10:24.593
Then we had to move from
East Chinatown to Spadina

10:24.628 --> 10:26.824
to make things work.

10:26.859 --> 10:28.725
Please remember
our mom's humanity.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.758
Of course.

10:39.793 --> 10:41.857
The CT scans are
processed, Dr. Cooper.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.857
Awesome, thank you, River.

10:44.925 --> 10:47.065
And Dr. Thompson is?

10:47.100 --> 10:49.824
Reviewing cases in his...
your office.

10:52.727 --> 10:54.065
It looks normal.

10:55.232 --> 10:57.098
Looks normal.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.527
There's an abnormality
in the brain scan.

11:01.562 --> 11:03.890
See this dark,
shaded spot, here?

11:03.925 --> 11:05.989
Localized swelling.

11:06.024 --> 11:07.989
The superficial veins
in the cerebrum have torn.

11:08.024 --> 11:09.692
Yeah.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.296
I could feel an indent.
River can you...

11:20.166 --> 11:22.197
There's a large bruise.

11:22.232 --> 11:24.725
Judging by the discolouration,
it isn't fresh.

11:26.595 --> 11:28.131
Okay, the brain shrinks with age

11:28.166 --> 11:30.263
and the space between
the dura and the skull

11:30.298 --> 11:32.230
fill with cerebrospinal fluid.

11:32.265 --> 11:35.032
So, a blow to the head

11:35.067 --> 11:37.857
could cause the veins to tear

11:37.892 --> 11:40.032
which would allow blood
to leak into that space,

11:40.067 --> 11:42.164
killing her slowly.

11:42.199 --> 11:44.659
- Classic delay injury.
- Mm-hmm.

11:44.694 --> 11:46.263
Polymorphs are gone.

11:46.298 --> 11:47.989
Yeah, those disappear
after a few days.

11:48.024 --> 11:49.890
Are there any microphages?

11:49.925 --> 11:51.956
Got 'em.

11:54.925 --> 11:57.989
Those white blood cells only
show up after tissue damage.

11:58.024 --> 12:00.098
Three days, to be exact.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.923
Eva's blow to the head...

12:02.958 --> 12:05.032
Was a subdural hematoma.

12:06.024 --> 12:07.824
Helen might be right.

12:08.826 --> 12:10.593
This could be murder.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.329
<i>Protestors gathered
early this morning</i>

12:14.364 --> 12:16.098
<i>and have continued
throughout the day.</i>

12:18.991 --> 12:22.362
You know, Rizal,
he doesn't even like birds.

12:22.397 --> 12:25.197
He's telling me, "Oh, they've
got evil eyes," or something.

12:25.232 --> 12:27.725
Yeah, what does he know,
right?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.758
I mean, I really appreciate
everything you're doing for me,

12:29.793 --> 12:33.164
but it's kind of weird
to have a stranger

12:33.199 --> 12:35.362
following you around,
even into the bathroom.

12:35.397 --> 12:37.362
It makes me feel old.

12:37.397 --> 12:39.791
It actually makes me
feel useless.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.989
Dad, you're not useless.

12:42.024 --> 12:43.989
You are independent,
you are important,

12:44.024 --> 12:46.395
you keep all the local
birds fed.

12:46.430 --> 12:49.065
I just, I want somebody there
with you while you do it.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.758
Well, how am I gonna
feed them?

12:50.793 --> 12:52.659
I can't even figure this out.
- Here, I'll help.

12:52.694 --> 12:53.923
- Will ya?
- Yeah.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.758
Okay. There's
no instructions.

12:55.793 --> 12:57.329
It's all right.

12:57.364 --> 12:58.956
Let's see.

13:00.199 --> 13:02.263
Can't Peggy be my person?

13:02.298 --> 13:05.857
She is, Dad. It's just...

13:05.892 --> 13:08.032
But what if she leaves again?

13:08.067 --> 13:09.791
That's not really
what I'm worried about.

13:09.826 --> 13:12.659
Well, you know, I got
dementia, so chances are,

13:12.694 --> 13:14.890
I won't even remember that
she was here to start with.

13:14.925 --> 13:17.131
That's terrible.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.890
You know, she is the love
of my life.

13:24.199 --> 13:26.758
I know, Dad,
I'm just...

13:26.793 --> 13:28.956
I'm not trying to stop you from
having a relationship with her.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.362
Well, but you know,
it's a bit embarrassing

13:32.397 --> 13:34.923
when I have to ask my daughter
to have permission

13:34.958 --> 13:37.065
to have a sleepover.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.923
It's uh, what's the word
I want, "unmanly".

13:41.232 --> 13:43.395
Yeah.

13:43.430 --> 13:45.692
Um...

13:45.727 --> 13:47.164
okay, how 'bout this?

13:47.199 --> 13:49.296
Uh, Rizal is the person
that you work with

13:49.331 --> 13:51.956
and Peggy is the person
that you um...

13:51.991 --> 13:53.999
you...

13:58.991 --> 14:00.923
Yeah, not so easy, is it?

14:05.463 --> 14:07.725
You threw me under the bus
with Professional Standards?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.032
I just told them
what happened.

14:09.067 --> 14:11.131
What happened?
What did happen?

14:14.199 --> 14:16.197
Where have you been?

14:16.232 --> 14:18.758
I just wrestled this away
from two giant raccoons.

14:18.793 --> 14:20.824
Is that a foot?

14:20.859 --> 14:22.890
I missed out on all
the stray feet

14:22.925 --> 14:25.230
that washed up in Vancouver
five years ago.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.461
Now, they said the feet were
disarticulated by natural means

14:28.496 --> 14:31.164
but you know West Coast
coroners.

14:31.199 --> 14:33.890
Ah, they're always puttin'
their foot in their mouths.

14:35.793 --> 14:37.758
Humorous, Detective.
If we have a foot mystery here,

14:37.793 --> 14:39.725
I might steal that
for a new book.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.032
Oh, sure, Doc,
it's all yours.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.890
Who called it in?
I'll talk to them.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.758
I wouldn't know.

14:44.793 --> 14:46.461
The Search for Ontario's
Dismembered Foot Killer,

14:46.496 --> 14:48.758
by Dr. Elijah Thompson.

14:48.793 --> 14:50.362
Hey! We're gonna need public
barriers.

14:50.397 --> 14:52.164
Or you could call it
"Trouble Afoot"

14:52.199 --> 14:54.065
or "Six Feet Under."

14:54.100 --> 14:56.032
All right, Detective,
let's not get carried away.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.296
Jenny.

14:59.793 --> 15:01.428
Uh-huh. Ye--

15:01.463 --> 15:03.362
Oh yeah, I'll be right there.

15:03.397 --> 15:05.230
Malik.
- Hmm?

15:05.265 --> 15:06.956
You got this?
Jenny needs me in Chinatown.

15:06.991 --> 15:09.230
Yeah, I got this.

15:12.199 --> 15:14.494
Looks like "heel"
be reading your report later.

15:14.529 --> 15:16.999
Ah, yeah, well I don't mind
going sole-o.

15:20.991 --> 15:22.956
All right.
- Oh.

15:22.991 --> 15:24.824
We found an elongated
depression

15:24.859 --> 15:26.824
on the back of Eva Chan's skull,

15:26.859 --> 15:29.032
like she was hit
with a rod or a pipe.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.494
So, it looks like
she was attacked.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.428
Uh, anti-Asian attacks
are usually random,

15:33.463 --> 15:35.065
and random attacks
are tough to solve.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.923
Yeah, well, we can date
this one -

15:36.958 --> 15:38.329
it's a three-day-old hematoma.

15:38.364 --> 15:39.989
Well, some of these
restaurants must have

15:40.024 --> 15:42.197
security footage
from three days ago.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.956
But first I need to talk
to the kids.

15:43.991 --> 15:46.164
Rule them out as suspects.

15:56.298 --> 15:58.131
<i>I know my mom
meant a lot to you,</i>

15:58.166 --> 16:00.197
<i>to all of us.</i>

16:00.232 --> 16:02.230
<i>I don't know what I'm gonna
do without her.</i>

16:02.265 --> 16:04.461
She dreamed of making this
community a safer place

16:04.496 --> 16:06.098
for my sister and me.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.032
For all of us.

16:12.364 --> 16:14.098
Mom's memorial is the most
views I've had

16:14.133 --> 16:16.197
since the pandemic started.

16:16.232 --> 16:18.428
- You're live-streaming this?
- From the restaurant account.

16:18.463 --> 16:20.032
People wanna connect.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.395
I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy,
Homicide.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.296
Homicide?

16:24.331 --> 16:26.923
Michael, uh your mother's
autopsy showed

16:26.958 --> 16:28.824
blunt force trauma to her head

16:28.859 --> 16:30.989
so we think she may have been
attacked.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.989
By who?
Who did this to my mother?

16:34.024 --> 16:36.362
Look, I want whoever did this--
- Michael, I just...

16:36.397 --> 16:38.329
The Coroner just told me
my mother was murdered.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.263
Isn't that right?

16:40.298 --> 16:42.263
Anti-Asian hate crimes
need to stop.

16:42.298 --> 16:43.989
Do you, or don't you, agree?

16:44.024 --> 16:45.956
Please, Dr. Cooper,

16:45.991 --> 16:47.329
we need our allies with us,
not behind us.

16:47.364 --> 16:49.197
Yes, Michael, I agree.

16:49.232 --> 16:51.230
I agree. Hate crimes have
to stop,

16:51.265 --> 16:53.263
not just here in the city,
but in the country.

16:53.298 --> 16:55.230
We need to protect
our elderly.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.989
We need justice!

16:57.024 --> 16:58.956
This is an open
investigation.

16:58.991 --> 17:00.164
You just publicly declared
it a hate crime.

17:00.199 --> 17:01.956
Donovan, I...

17:01.991 --> 17:03.956
Okay. If I wanted to work
with someone undermining

17:03.991 --> 17:05.956
my authority, I'd call Malik!
- What is going on?

17:05.991 --> 17:08.032
Why are you acting like this?
- If I want someone to...

17:08.067 --> 17:09.527
psychoanalyze me, I would've
stayed with Kirima.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.230
You and Kirima broke up?

17:13.265 --> 17:15.461
Look, you-you just decreased
the odds of us finding

17:15.496 --> 17:18.461
an unbiased witness, all right.
You just made my job harder.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.395
Donovan, okay, look,

17:20.430 --> 17:22.098
if you don't wanna talk
about Kirima right now,

17:22.133 --> 17:24.428
that's fine,
but I am on your team.

17:24.463 --> 17:26.956
Then don't declare things on
social media without evidence.

17:26.991 --> 17:29.164
I... didn't!

17:37.430 --> 17:39.197
There's never a dull
day here.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.065
Don't worry, foot, we're
gonna find the rest of you.

17:50.364 --> 17:53.527
The bite marks
from a raccoon obscure it,

17:53.562 --> 17:55.857
but it's a clean cut.

17:55.892 --> 17:57.494
This foot is not
disarticulated.

17:57.529 --> 18:00.296
Non-serrated blade, smooth
like the edge of a shovel,

18:00.331 --> 18:02.230
or a carving knife.

18:02.265 --> 18:04.032
All right.

18:05.364 --> 18:06.329
What's that?

18:07.397 --> 18:09.395
A foot.

18:09.430 --> 18:12.164
No, that! Ugh!

18:12.199 --> 18:14.329
There's something green
under the toenail.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.890
Uh, River, do you wanna
do the honours?

18:26.463 --> 18:28.263
Toe fungus?

18:28.298 --> 18:29.956
Actually...

18:29.991 --> 18:32.230
Haematococcus Pluvialis motile,

18:32.265 --> 18:34.428
a.k.a. Algae.

18:36.024 --> 18:37.395
Was there water near
the industrial park

18:37.430 --> 18:39.164
where we found that foot?

18:39.199 --> 18:41.263
Carlaw Spit
juts into Lake Ontario.

18:41.298 --> 18:43.329
And has many wetland ponds.

18:44.529 --> 18:46.230
We're going fishing.

18:46.265 --> 18:48.065
Can you keep your
voices down?

18:48.100 --> 18:49.956
Helen took some CBD oil

18:49.991 --> 18:51.989
and she's finally asleep
in Mom's bed.

18:52.024 --> 18:53.956
All right, we need to retrace
your mother's steps

18:53.991 --> 18:55.956
from three days ago.
Can you remember what she did?

18:55.991 --> 18:57.428
Worked at the restaurant
all day.

18:57.463 --> 18:59.098
Closed up at 11:00 p.m..

18:59.133 --> 19:01.329
Okay, what happens
after you close?

19:01.364 --> 19:03.230
Thursday night, Mom does
the bank deposit, garbage,

19:03.265 --> 19:06.098
resets the rat traps.
I mop up and do final cleaning.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.560
And garbage bins are?

19:07.595 --> 19:09.296
Out in the back alley.

19:09.331 --> 19:11.263
She'll take the pathway
then to the bank.

19:11.298 --> 19:13.263
Okay, she never mentioned
anything

19:13.298 --> 19:15.494
out of the ordinary happening?
- She didn't,

19:15.529 --> 19:18.461
but that isn't strange for her.
She was proud.

19:18.496 --> 19:21.032
Did you talk to her
at all that night?

19:21.067 --> 19:23.032
I was stocking the fridges
when she came home.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.131
Bedroom door was closed
when I came upstairs.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.197
And did she act unusual
at all the next day?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.989
She would've had a concussion
and she wouldn't have known

19:29.024 --> 19:30.956
that the subdural hematoma
may kill her.

19:30.991 --> 19:32.461
She did seem worn out.

19:32.496 --> 19:34.527
I thought she just needed
a break.

19:34.562 --> 19:36.296
I mean, does it make sense
that she would hide

19:36.331 --> 19:38.098
the assault from you?

19:38.133 --> 19:39.362
She knew that I would lose it.

19:39.397 --> 19:41.626
Did you ever lose it
with your mom?

19:45.265 --> 19:47.362
You're trying to find
my mother's killer.

19:47.397 --> 19:49.329
That's why you're asking
that question.

19:49.364 --> 19:52.032
No.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.230
We were close.

19:54.265 --> 19:56.197
I wanted to carry on her legacy
with Dumpling House

19:56.232 --> 19:58.362
after everything she did
for me and my sister.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.395
Do you have any cameras
set up in back?

20:00.430 --> 20:03.131
<i>No.</i>

20:03.166 --> 20:05.164
Mom was too frugal
for things like that.

20:05.199 --> 20:07.527
Helen, go back to bed.

20:07.562 --> 20:10.362
Come on.
I'm worried about you.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.263
I'll have Forensics work up

20:18.298 --> 20:20.197
the restaurant
and the apartment

20:20.232 --> 20:22.065
and I'll canvas the
neighbourhood for cameras.

20:22.100 --> 20:24.065
Okay, and if you could
ask them to look for anything

20:24.100 --> 20:25.659
that's cylindrical that could
have been used as a weapon.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.032
He told her.

20:33.991 --> 20:34.989
Hey...

20:44.661 --> 20:46.230
Hey, Malik,
- Hey, Jenny,

20:46.265 --> 20:49.032
we need you here, ASAP.
Eli needs your help.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.692
Uh yeah, I was just gonna
head back to the office,

20:50.727 --> 20:52.626
<i>but I can reroute.</i>

20:54.496 --> 20:55.692
- Oh!
- Yeah!

20:55.727 --> 20:57.989
We've hit the motherload,
Detective!

20:58.024 --> 21:00.098
Get off the phone!

21:00.133 --> 21:02.725
Eli just pulled out a bag
of hand. Um...

21:02.760 --> 21:05.263
Oh, uh yeah,
I'll be right there.

21:53.595 --> 21:54.692
Son of a...

22:08.628 --> 22:10.791
Come on, Eva!

22:20.859 --> 22:22.692
Good for you!

22:33.793 --> 22:36.725
Jenny, Eva Chan fought back.
Hard.

22:36.760 --> 22:39.098
And thanks to your livestream,

22:39.133 --> 22:41.197
everyone wanted to talk to me.

22:41.232 --> 22:42.560
<i>Just forwarded you a
neighbour's security cam video.</i>

22:44.595 --> 22:46.626
Yeah, it looks like
he's waiting for her.

22:46.661 --> 22:49.098
<i>Exactly.
Which means it wasn't random.</i>

22:50.199 --> 22:51.824
Well, now we need
to figure out

22:51.859 --> 22:54.824
who would have motive
to hurt Eva Chan.

22:54.859 --> 22:57.131
<i>That's what
I'm gonna find out.</i>

23:00.793 --> 23:02.593
Cooper!

23:02.628 --> 23:04.857
Caught your livestream,

23:04.892 --> 23:07.692
as did all 131 staff who work
at the Coroner's office.

23:09.166 --> 23:10.791
Ooh, the paperwork on that
is gonna be a novel!

23:10.826 --> 23:13.593
One already-filled-out
impact form.

23:13.628 --> 23:15.527
Ah, little muddy.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.197
next time you livestream,

23:18.232 --> 23:19.791
stand 45 degrees to the camera.

23:19.826 --> 23:22.329
It's more flattering.
- Thank you.

23:22.364 --> 23:24.098
All right,
now we get to figure out

23:24.133 --> 23:25.791
if all these pieces
belong to one body.

23:25.826 --> 23:27.659
- Freeze!
- What?

23:27.694 --> 23:29.692
Leech!

23:29.727 --> 23:31.527
Oh, my God, get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

23:31.562 --> 23:33.296
Well, don't let the pee-ons
see you panic.

23:33.331 --> 23:35.296
I'm not, just get it off,
please. Oh, my God,

23:35.331 --> 23:37.230
oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Just, okay.

23:38.727 --> 23:40.626
Get it off me. It's not funny
Eli, get it off.

23:40.661 --> 23:42.626
No, no, no, don't yank it.
Those toxins will release

23:42.661 --> 23:44.560
into your bloodstream, okay.
- Get it off.

23:44.595 --> 23:46.296
No, I got it,
I got it. Here you go.

23:46.331 --> 23:48.428
- Get it off, get it off, hm.
- So, listen, hey, fun fact.

23:48.463 --> 23:50.131
There's nothing fun about
this. Get it off my arm

23:50.166 --> 23:51.560
right now.
- Yeah, no but listen,

23:51.595 --> 23:53.362
it's mouth is the thinner,
smaller side of its body.

23:53.397 --> 23:54.692
I would've thought
it would be the opp--

23:54.727 --> 23:56.362
- Ah!
- Okay! Oh, oh, okay.

23:56.397 --> 23:58.164
Okay. We're good, we're good.
- Ooh!

23:58.199 --> 24:00.560
Ooh, look that classic
Y-shaped bite.

24:00.595 --> 24:02.296
Ow.

24:03.793 --> 24:05.494
Looks like you're gonna
have to do some paperwork.

24:07.496 --> 24:09.593
You got personally involved.

24:10.826 --> 24:12.626
Hmm.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.857
Hey.

24:40.628 --> 24:42.395
What're you doing, Alphonse?

24:42.430 --> 24:44.164
Oh, you know,
I'm just down here um...

24:44.199 --> 24:45.659
look, I think I have a stalker.

24:46.925 --> 24:48.692
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Shh-shh-shh!

24:48.727 --> 24:50.626
My latest hookup
just showed up.

24:50.661 --> 24:52.593
I-I don't know how
he found out where I work,

24:52.628 --> 24:54.692
nor do I know why
I keep falling for young

24:54.727 --> 24:56.758
and clingy gays.
I mean, he's cute, yes, but--

24:56.793 --> 24:59.890
Okay, I don't-I don't see any
stalker, Alphonse. I just--

24:59.925 --> 25:02.461
Oh, hey, Ross!
- Hey, Mom!

25:02.496 --> 25:03.956
Hi! What're you doin'?

25:03.991 --> 25:05.692
Well, I finally got
a FoodScouts order,

25:05.727 --> 25:07.329
but they cancelled
the Shirazi Salad,

25:07.364 --> 25:08.626
so I thought maybe
you were hungry.

25:08.661 --> 25:10.296
Oh, sorry, Honey. I'm--

25:10.331 --> 25:11.890
Also, Grandpa doesn't
like the PSW.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.692
Okay, well, I think he just
needs a little more time...

25:13.727 --> 25:14.791
...to acclimate.

25:16.463 --> 25:19.824
Ooh.
- Ooooo...kay.

25:19.859 --> 25:21.626
- You guys know each other?
- No, no!

25:21.661 --> 25:23.659
No! Hi, I'm Ross.

25:23.694 --> 25:26.461
Alphonse,
your mother's assistant.

25:26.496 --> 25:28.263
Mm. Mm.

25:29.859 --> 25:31.824
Right, right, right, okay.
I'm gonna just...

25:31.859 --> 25:34.362
I'm gonna go and get a coffee.

25:34.397 --> 25:36.593
Ross, you can leave my salad
on... in... just.

25:36.628 --> 25:38.692
- Bye, JC.
- See ya later!

25:41.628 --> 25:43.362
- She's your boss!
- You're her son?

25:43.397 --> 25:45.692
- Okay, last night...
- Never again.

25:48.397 --> 25:49.593
Oh, God.

25:54.529 --> 25:57.989
Just I told you never,

25:58.024 --> 26:01.560
never to come back around here,
you thief.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.626
After you bankrupted
my business.

26:04.661 --> 26:06.527
Mr. Cooper,
I'm Rizal, your PSW!

26:06.562 --> 26:07.989
You're gonna pay back
every red cent!

26:08.024 --> 26:09.758
Yes, you are,
and if you don't pay me back,

26:09.793 --> 26:12.395
I'm gonna throw you down
a decommissioned mineshaft,

26:12.430 --> 26:13.758
which I know where one is.
- Oh, Gordie!

26:13.793 --> 26:15.989
I'm gonna throw you
down there.

26:16.024 --> 26:18.296
Do you understand me?
- Gordie! Gordie, whoa.

26:18.331 --> 26:19.725
- What?
- Whoa. Gord, Gord,

26:19.760 --> 26:21.395
do you know who this is?

26:21.430 --> 26:22.596
Don't-don't-don't,
no, don't.

26:22.631 --> 26:25.527
You're not gonna take his side
again here, are you, Pegs?

26:25.562 --> 26:28.527
'Course I know who this is.
This is Doug Frost,

26:28.562 --> 26:30.692
the swindler who took
all my money.

26:30.727 --> 26:32.659
Honey, you wanna grab a beer?

26:32.694 --> 26:34.659
Come, let's make a pizza.
- Oh, pizza.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.659
Yeah, come on, 'cause
I got all your favourite--

26:36.694 --> 26:38.461
- No pizza for Doug the Slug.
- That's right. That's right.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.494
- Right?
- None.

26:40.529 --> 26:41.758
Because he's leaving,
right now.

26:41.793 --> 26:43.692
He's not leaving,
he's sittin' right there.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.692
- He's going. Help me unpack.
- Don't you leave!

26:45.727 --> 26:47.692
Look, look what I got for
you, all your favourites.

26:47.727 --> 26:50.428
They're all here.
You unpack for me. Okay?

26:50.463 --> 26:51.989
- Okay.
- Oh, for God's sake.

26:52.024 --> 26:53.956
- I thought it was a game.
- Oh.

26:53.991 --> 26:55.692
Love it.

26:55.727 --> 26:58.296
It's just,
I think you trigger him.

26:58.331 --> 27:00.428
You look exactly like an
old business partner of his

27:00.463 --> 27:03.263
that stole from him
30 years ago.

27:03.298 --> 27:04.692
That would've been
good to know!

27:04.727 --> 27:06.989
Yeah, well, I tried.
Listen, I-I think that you

27:07.024 --> 27:08.725
should probably
not come back, okay?

27:08.760 --> 27:10.593
Shh-shh-shh,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

27:10.628 --> 27:11.956
I mean, it's nothing
against you, it's just--

27:11.991 --> 27:13.956
- Okay, got it.
- You should be safe at work.

27:13.991 --> 27:15.989
- Ooh, onions.
- Thanks for everything.

27:16.024 --> 27:17.791
God, what was I saying?
What was I saying?

27:17.826 --> 27:19.428
Hold on, hold it! Hold it!

27:22.496 --> 27:24.890
Well, good night, Rizal.
I'll see ya tomorrow, eh?

27:27.364 --> 27:28.824
Take it easy, Bud.

27:30.364 --> 27:31.989
Yeah. He was starting
to grow on me.

27:32.024 --> 27:34.692
I should be the one
looking after you.

27:34.727 --> 27:36.362
Well, but Baby, you are,
aren't ya?

27:36.397 --> 27:38.296
- Mm.
- No?

27:41.925 --> 27:43.758
Let's go!

27:43.793 --> 27:45.428
Head... to toe.

27:54.826 --> 27:56.428
♪ Keep moving,
Keep moving ♪

27:56.463 --> 27:58.032
♪ Improving ♪

27:58.067 --> 27:59.428
♪ You're blooming ♪

27:59.463 --> 28:01.428
♪ Assuming you're moving
all the time ♪

28:01.463 --> 28:02.890
♪ All the time ♪

28:11.727 --> 28:13.362
Okay...

28:14.793 --> 28:17.032
and the foot is a match,
as I predicted.

28:17.067 --> 28:20.560
Isn't a prediction
just a guess based on bias

28:20.595 --> 28:22.626
and not evidence?
- Shh.

28:22.661 --> 28:25.593
I heard that.
Well, many pieces, one victim.

28:26.595 --> 28:28.395
A sad body mosaic.

28:34.694 --> 28:36.428
Oh, what are these marks?

28:36.463 --> 28:38.494
They look like they're
from a foreign object.

28:38.529 --> 28:40.428
Not the weapon used
to dismember him.

28:40.463 --> 28:43.032
These cuts are clean.
Dr. Garcia?

28:43.067 --> 28:44.890
It's the same over here.

28:44.925 --> 28:47.131
A smooth, sharp blade
made all of these cuts.

28:47.166 --> 28:48.494
Well, the fingertips
are fish-nibbled,

28:48.529 --> 28:50.560
but the skin is intact,

28:50.595 --> 28:52.593
so I'd put body disposal
within the past 24 hours.

28:53.595 --> 28:55.692
Within the past 24 hours?

28:55.727 --> 28:57.593
The base of the skull's
fractured. That's fatal.

28:59.892 --> 29:01.956
What kind of mammal got
to the face before we did?

29:01.991 --> 29:03.692
An otter?

29:03.727 --> 29:04.956
We need another way
to ID him.

29:06.859 --> 29:08.824
Mandible's intact.

29:08.859 --> 29:11.065
I'll take post-mortem
dental X-rays

29:11.100 --> 29:13.527
and compare them to ante-mortem
dental records.

29:13.562 --> 29:15.494
Thank you, River.

29:46.133 --> 29:48.098
Randy Groat, the GOAT?

29:48.133 --> 29:49.890
Someone's been
defacing my signs,

29:49.925 --> 29:51.857
drawing moustaches on 'em,
and worse.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.725
That's a crime.

29:53.760 --> 29:55.593
You know, a lot of people
in the neighbourhood

29:55.628 --> 29:57.527
have been complaining about
your overly-aggressive

29:57.562 --> 29:59.065
sales tactics.
- Dynamic.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.659
I believed the words
used were bullying.

30:00.694 --> 30:02.527
- Motivating.
- Harassment.

30:02.562 --> 30:04.758
Persistence!
That's why I'm the GOAT,

30:04.793 --> 30:07.197
Greatest of All-Time
Real Estate King.

30:07.232 --> 30:08.824
You're trying to push out
the original owners

30:08.859 --> 30:11.032
of Chinatown businesses.
- No.

30:11.067 --> 30:12.956
Were you trying to buy
the Chan's restaurant?

30:12.991 --> 30:15.098
They weren't exactly booming
with business, all right?

30:15.133 --> 30:16.989
Nobody understood
they'd make more money

30:17.024 --> 30:18.824
selling the property.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.527
Could never convince
that old lady. Shame!

30:21.562 --> 30:23.890
She could've retired wealthy.
- But instead she's dead!

30:23.925 --> 30:26.791
Yeah, I heard that.
I'm sorry.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.758
Maybe now, the kids
will see reason.

30:30.232 --> 30:32.791
- Can I see your right forearm?
- Why?

30:32.826 --> 30:34.461
Well, we could always
go to the station

30:34.496 --> 30:36.131
and take a look there.

30:41.826 --> 30:43.626
Put in a good word for me
with the Chan kids?

30:45.133 --> 30:47.725
Pick up your posterboards or
I'll charge you with littering.

30:52.496 --> 30:53.725
Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.494
Look what I found
in the alley

30:55.529 --> 30:56.762
where Eva Chan was attacked.

30:56.797 --> 30:59.494
Ah! Here you are again
in the suite, Detective McAvoy,

30:59.529 --> 31:01.791
despite the multiple requests.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.791
Is that what she hit
her assailant with?

31:04.826 --> 31:07.560
Yeah. Almost looks like
dried blood on these nails,

31:07.595 --> 31:09.197
so hopefully we'll be able
to pull some DNA.

31:10.991 --> 31:12.956
Is that?

31:12.991 --> 31:15.659
Unknown victim. Chances
are the rest of the body

31:15.694 --> 31:17.923
washed away or disintegrated.

31:17.958 --> 31:20.230
What're you doin'?

31:20.265 --> 31:21.956
Hold this for a second.

31:21.991 --> 31:23.857
No, no, no. Nope.
Oh, come on.

31:23.892 --> 31:26.692
Don't contaminate the...
Je--

31:35.265 --> 31:37.032
The dismembered man
is the one

31:37.067 --> 31:38.593
who assaulted Eva Chan.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.692
Yeah.

31:49.595 --> 31:51.263
Hey, look, I know,
I know there's a lot going on

31:51.298 --> 31:53.527
for you right now
and I-I don't really,

31:53.562 --> 31:55.560
I don't wanna pry,
but you know,

31:55.595 --> 31:57.758
if anybody understands
the difficulties between

31:57.793 --> 32:00.527
balancing work and life,
it's me.

32:01.793 --> 32:04.560
Uh, Dr. Sharma,
he really is the best.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.956
Look, somebody knew our
John Doe assaulted Eva Chan.

32:08.991 --> 32:10.956
I mean, this was revenge.

32:10.991 --> 32:13.131
JC! River got an
ID on the dental records.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.593
Jason Pence from Lucky
Barbecue Blitz.

32:17.628 --> 32:19.098
That's the restaurant
next to the Chan's.

32:19.133 --> 32:20.956
Yeah, I'll go check it out.

32:20.991 --> 32:23.098
Okay, I'm gonna keep trying
to piece this guy together.

32:25.991 --> 32:28.758
Merci, Alphonse?
So, de rien, Jenny.

32:28.793 --> 32:30.725
No problem, Detective,
I got your back, too!

32:31.991 --> 32:34.131
You're doin' a bang-up job.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.791
Hey, Alphonse?

32:35.826 --> 32:37.659
Oh, hey! You're still here.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.758
Yeah, I was just waiting
for Mom... to leave.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.296
Which she did, without trying
my Shirazi salad.

32:42.331 --> 32:43.923
Oh, hey, I'm famished.

32:45.133 --> 32:46.692
I'll try it.

32:46.727 --> 32:48.263
- Really?
- Yeah, okay.

32:49.793 --> 32:51.791
Um, be honest, but maybe not
like, too honest.

32:51.826 --> 32:53.593
I've been sort of fiddling
around

32:53.628 --> 32:55.725
with some of my Dad's recipes,
trying to stay connected

32:55.760 --> 32:58.164
to my roots while putting
my own flair in there.

32:58.199 --> 32:59.989
You know, so...

33:00.024 --> 33:02.659
Oh... it's-it's that bad.

33:02.694 --> 33:05.131
- Um... is there sesame?
- Yeah!

33:05.166 --> 33:07.791
Yeah, that's the dressing.
Wow, that's, mm-hmm.

33:09.694 --> 33:11.857
That's clever.
- Allergic.

33:13.925 --> 33:17.329
Okay, um... don't move.

33:17.364 --> 33:19.560
Okay. EpiPen.

33:19.595 --> 33:21.263
- What?
- Drawer.

33:22.298 --> 33:24.296
EpiPen. EpiPen.

33:25.727 --> 33:26.956
You didn't tell me
that you were allergic.

33:28.232 --> 33:30.164
Who puts sesame

33:30.199 --> 33:32.032
in a Shirazi salad?

33:32.067 --> 33:33.791
Ugh!

33:40.024 --> 33:43.065
Your competence...

33:43.100 --> 33:44.857
is hot.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.058
Yeah, I guess...

33:46.093 --> 33:48.593
I guess all those years of CPR
training finally paid off.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.824
Sorry for hiding from you.

33:54.925 --> 33:56.692
Sorry for poisoning you.

33:59.024 --> 34:01.230
<i>911, what's your
emergency?</i>

34:14.727 --> 34:17.263
- Hi there.
- Hey, uh slider?

34:17.298 --> 34:19.362
We're trying a new brand
of vegan meat.

34:19.397 --> 34:21.857
No thanks.
I'm Detective Donovan McAvoy,

34:21.892 --> 34:22.791
I'm here about your brother,
Jason.

34:22.827 --> 34:25.263
Ah, did you find him drunk
in an alley?

34:25.298 --> 34:26.956
Didn't show up for work
and we're slammed.

34:26.991 --> 34:29.659
I'm sorry.

34:29.694 --> 34:31.626
We found Jason's body.
He was killed.

34:32.430 --> 34:34.032
Wait, he was what?

34:35.133 --> 34:36.956
How?

34:38.067 --> 34:40.131
Doing what?

34:40.166 --> 34:42.131
Were you trying to push the
Chan's out of their restaurant?

34:42.166 --> 34:44.725
You guys are busy.
You could use the room.

34:44.760 --> 34:46.098
No!

34:46.133 --> 34:47.626
I mean-I mean we did offer,

34:47.661 --> 34:49.923
but Mrs. Chan didn't wanna sell.

34:49.958 --> 34:51.725
Well, maybe you thought
you could frighten

34:51.760 --> 34:53.197
Mrs. Chan into leaving.

34:53.232 --> 34:55.197
Took advantage of the rise
in anti-Asian violence,

34:55.232 --> 34:56.758
attacked her?

34:57.958 --> 35:00.692
Jason said that he ran
into her the other night

35:00.727 --> 35:02.725
and he said she might sell now.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.791
He did more than
run into her.

35:06.430 --> 35:08.362
Yeah, I told him
it was a stupid plan.

35:11.925 --> 35:13.395
Was it Michael
who killed my brother?

35:14.397 --> 35:16.362
Wait here.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.659
Hey, how ya doin',
Michael?

35:30.694 --> 35:33.098
- Detective.
- Where were you last night?

35:33.133 --> 35:35.791
- I was here.
- Can I see your hands?

35:43.166 --> 35:45.923
Let's talk at the station.
You're not under arrest.

35:45.958 --> 35:48.461
Wait, you think I killed
my own mother?

35:48.496 --> 35:50.329
What kind of monster
do you think I am?

35:50.364 --> 35:52.362
That's not what this
is about.

35:52.397 --> 35:54.857
Someone killed Jason Pence
from next door.

35:54.892 --> 35:55.825
Of course you take
immediate action

35:55.860 --> 35:58.032
after a white guy gets killed.
- That's...

35:58.067 --> 36:00.164
not what's happening here.
- What about my mother?

36:00.199 --> 36:02.428
Let's talk at the station.
Sort it all out.

36:11.859 --> 36:13.131
After you found out your
mother was assaulted--

36:13.166 --> 36:15.362
Murdered.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.296
You're pretty good
with a cleaver, aren't you?

36:17.331 --> 36:19.098
From all these years working
in your mother's restaurant.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.890
Yeah, so?

36:27.958 --> 36:30.461
You chopped up Jason's body
so it would be easier to move.

36:30.496 --> 36:32.395
Turned him into bags of meat.

36:33.793 --> 36:35.857
The justice you said you wanted
when you were live-streaming.

36:35.892 --> 36:38.758
That's not justice.
That's disgusting.

36:38.793 --> 36:40.494
Now, you're a smart guy,
you cleaned the cleaver.

36:40.529 --> 36:42.362
No, it was already clean.

36:43.496 --> 36:45.857
What does that mean, Michael?

36:54.925 --> 36:56.791
Thanks for coming. I
didn't know who else to call.

36:58.232 --> 37:00.131
I need you to help me
get him out of there.

37:01.397 --> 37:04.131
I'm not sure
how much I can do.

37:04.166 --> 37:06.395
He-he didn't do anything.
My brother is innocent.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.164
<i>Helen?</i>

37:15.430 --> 37:17.263
This mark on your arm,

37:17.298 --> 37:18.956
where did you get it?

37:18.991 --> 37:20.923
I don't know,
I must've scratched myself.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.890
- No, this is a leech bite.
- What are you talking about?

37:24.859 --> 37:27.461
You were in the water.
You helped Michael.

37:27.496 --> 37:29.989
He didn't do anything.

37:30.024 --> 37:31.791
Then who did?

37:37.430 --> 37:39.362
I didn't mean it to happen.

37:39.397 --> 37:41.296
Helen, what's going on?

37:42.496 --> 37:44.362
Mom made me promise not
to tell you about the attack.

37:44.397 --> 37:46.263
She didn't want you to snap.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.725
I'm sorry, Mikey.

37:49.364 --> 37:51.527
Jason texted me yesterday.

37:51.562 --> 37:54.098
<i>Said he wanted to talk.
But was pressuring us</i>

37:54.133 --> 37:56.296
<i>to sell the restaurant
now that Mom is dead.</i>

37:56.331 --> 37:59.098
<i>He said we were bringing down
the value of their business.</i>

37:59.133 --> 38:01.131
He called me disgusting
racial slurs.

38:02.265 --> 38:04.197
<i>I saw the fresh scars</i>

38:04.232 --> 38:05.791
<i>and I knew that he was the one
who attacked Mom.</i>

38:07.166 --> 38:08.560
Did he admit it?

38:11.463 --> 38:13.230
<i>I just couldn't
take it anymore.</i>

38:13.265 --> 38:14.890
- Ugh!
- Agh!

38:14.925 --> 38:17.362
<i>I just snapped.</i>

38:29.133 --> 38:31.263
<i>In that moment
I became just like him.</i>

38:32.265 --> 38:34.296
<i>A monster.</i>

38:41.892 --> 38:44.857
<i>Anti-Asian racism
is killing us.</i>

38:44.892 --> 38:46.494
<i>Our souls.</i>

39:00.529 --> 39:02.890
I had to make him into smaller
pieces to carry.

39:04.199 --> 39:06.164
When?

39:06.199 --> 39:08.230
Last night.

39:08.265 --> 39:10.494
All night.

39:10.529 --> 39:12.890
I got home before you woke up.

39:17.397 --> 39:19.164
Oh, Helen!

39:21.024 --> 39:23.098
You had no choice.
You had to fight back.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.329
Uh, Helen...

39:31.199 --> 39:32.890
you never should've been put
in that position.

39:33.925 --> 39:35.857
But I'm gonna need you
to come with me

39:35.892 --> 39:37.296
and give a full statement.

40:05.595 --> 40:08.329
She'll go to trial and
they'll argue self defence.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.461
Maybe her lawyer can help get
her some counselling.

40:10.496 --> 40:12.362
Yeah.

40:12.397 --> 40:14.428
Yeah, let's hope so.

40:14.463 --> 40:16.428
Case closed, I guess.

40:17.430 --> 40:19.428
Yeah.

40:19.463 --> 40:21.230
Solved, not closed.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.890
Get up!

40:37.463 --> 40:39.164
What?

40:39.199 --> 40:41.560
Hit me.

40:41.595 --> 40:43.890
I'm not gonna
hit ya, Mac.

40:43.925 --> 40:46.197
You felt powerless.
Take your power back.

40:48.265 --> 40:50.098
It's not gonna help.

40:50.133 --> 40:52.428
But badmouthing me
to Sergeant Waylen will?

40:52.463 --> 40:54.560
You were supposed
to have my back, Mac.

40:54.595 --> 40:56.923
And you were supposed
to have mine.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.527
You held a gun
to your own forehead.

40:59.562 --> 41:01.296
That affects me, too, man!

41:03.331 --> 41:05.098
Know what?

41:06.397 --> 41:09.230
Maybe this partnership
has run its course.

41:44.496 --> 41:46.725
Hey...

41:48.760 --> 41:50.395
I got your message.
Is everything okay?

41:50.430 --> 41:52.593
Everything is fine.
I handled it.

41:52.628 --> 41:54.626
Oh, God.
I've gotta call Rizal.

41:54.661 --> 41:56.999
I've gotta call the agency.
- Jenny, I handled it.

41:59.727 --> 42:01.956
He just, he thought
that he was...

42:01.991 --> 42:05.197
getting the last word
in an old betrayal.

42:05.232 --> 42:06.989
Hey, Dad?

42:07.024 --> 42:08.560
Hi.

42:08.595 --> 42:10.692
- Hi.
- You okay?

42:10.727 --> 42:12.659
- No, I lost my temper.
- Oh, that's okay.

42:12.694 --> 42:14.329
I'm really scared.

42:14.364 --> 42:16.329
Of who? Of Rizal?

42:16.364 --> 42:18.494
No! No, no, no, of me.

42:18.529 --> 42:21.065
I mean, one minute I-I'm okay,
I'm fine,

42:21.100 --> 42:23.065
and then, the next minute
I'm seeing things

42:23.100 --> 42:25.197
that you would not believe.
- Okay.

42:25.232 --> 42:27.494
And then I become paranoid
for no rhyme or reason.

42:27.529 --> 42:30.032
It's okay, we'll just up
your dosage of galantamine.

42:30.067 --> 42:31.758
I don't wanna
become a monster.

42:31.793 --> 42:33.692
Hey, Dad?

42:33.727 --> 42:36.197
You're not a monster, okay?
- Okay.

42:37.595 --> 42:39.197
It's just...

42:40.232 --> 42:42.098
just...

42:42.133 --> 42:43.527
you might need a little
more support.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.692
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:54.024 --> 42:56.164
Okay,
just line that up there.
