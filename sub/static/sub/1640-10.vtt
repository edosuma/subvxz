WEBVTT

00:02.090 --> 00:04.358
Oh my God, what smells so good?

00:06.294 --> 00:08.929
You made me muffins.

00:09.931 --> 00:12.995
Uh, no, those are for Josh's birthday,

00:12.996 --> 00:14.734
so feel free to look
at as many as you want.

00:14.735 --> 00:16.286
- Can I look at it on the way to my mouth?
- Nuh-uh-uh!

00:18.038 --> 00:20.873
- Yours is here.
- Aww.

00:20.908 --> 00:24.794
The little, runty sad one
from the leftover batter.

00:26.647 --> 00:29.415
Aww. I'm gonna put it out of its misery.

00:32.118 --> 00:33.418
God, I can't wait to see
the look on Josh's face

00:33.453 --> 00:35.481
when I hand him my birthday present.

00:35.482 --> 00:38.503
Okay, I'm gonna say this one more time:

00:38.504 --> 00:41.397
Your gift is super girlfriendy.

00:41.897 --> 00:43.719
Oh please.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.964
His favorite childhood blanket
was partially destroyed in a fire.

00:45.998 --> 00:48.933
All I did was hunt down the exact
color of yarn on the Internet,

00:48.968 --> 00:51.536
and take crochet classes and
spend three weeks recreating it.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.890
I mean, that is the same thing
that I would do for anybody.

00:57.976 --> 01:01.552
Hey, sorry I'm late.
We ran out of hot water

01:01.553 --> 01:03.582
and I had to shower one
body part at a time...

01:04.682 --> 01:08.618
But I did make birthday
banana chocolate chip muffins.

01:09.687 --> 01:13.990
Well, feed me one, I can't take a break
until I tied at least 100 more ribbons.

01:14.024 --> 01:16.109
Hey, Terence, I got
your tablecloth samples.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.927
Just so you know, they look great...

01:17.962 --> 01:19.763
In my trash can!

01:22.101 --> 01:26.306
Uh, what's going on? Is this
all for Josh's birthday party?

01:26.307 --> 01:28.919
No, Caroline's dream wedding
venue became available,

01:28.920 --> 01:30.425
so they moved the wedding up to Saturday.

01:30.426 --> 01:33.150
What? No no no no no,

01:33.151 --> 01:35.743
Josh is supposed to be getting
married six months from now,

01:35.744 --> 01:37.479
not now, not now, not now!

01:39.212 --> 01:40.345
I mean, uh...

01:40.380 --> 01:43.148
I mean yeah, Josh is
getting married!

01:45.617 --> 01:48.519
Uh, so how's Josh doing with all this?

01:49.588 --> 01:52.323
Hey. Hey, guys. Hey, great people.

01:52.374 --> 01:54.392
Isn't today great? Today's a great day.

01:54.426 --> 01:56.346
Today's just full of
greatness on this great day.

01:57.146 --> 01:59.096
I think he'd say "great".

01:59.131 --> 02:02.834
Well, yeah, 'cause it's your 30th birthday.

02:02.885 --> 02:05.636
You remembered my birthday
and my favorite muffins?

02:05.671 --> 02:09.235
Aww. I wonder if I'd still love them

02:09.235 --> 02:11.530
if they were the only kind I
could eat for the rest of my life.

02:14.079 --> 02:17.662
Josh, eyes on me. We've
got a million things to do.

02:17.663 --> 02:19.704
We've gotta hire a 12-piece orchestra

02:19.705 --> 02:22.962
and a photographer, and God help
us with the salmon situation.

02:22.963 --> 02:24.160
We have a salmon situation?

02:25.160 --> 02:28.191
You don't want to eat farm-raised salmon
on the most important night of your life.

02:28.215 --> 02:31.557
- Ooh.
- People, this wedding is in five days.

02:31.558 --> 02:33.326
It is happening!

02:36.666 --> 02:39.301
I'll never let go, Josh! Never!

02:52.482 --> 02:55.117
This birthday dinner is
so delicious!

02:55.151 --> 02:57.536
Makes me almost forget it's
10:00 and I'm still at work.

02:59.372 --> 03:02.324
Oh, well, it's time for
Presents!

03:02.326 --> 03:04.126
No no, we have to wait for Caroline.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.045
Her favorite part about birthdays is
when she gets to see how much better

03:07.080 --> 03:08.480
her present is than everybody else's.

03:09.549 --> 03:12.417
Oh, I'm so excited for
her to be my new boss.

03:15.171 --> 03:17.472
Well, while we wait, there is
a Julia Roberts marathon on,

03:17.507 --> 03:20.475
and if we turn it on right now we can
catch my favorite part of "Pretty Woman".

03:20.510 --> 03:21.590
I don't have time to waste.

03:21.601 --> 03:24.346
I have to meet with the flautist,
the florist and find a flower girl.

03:24.348 --> 03:25.397
Frankly, I'm fried.

03:27.233 --> 03:28.553
I don't wanna watch "Pretty Woman".

03:28.577 --> 03:29.518
It's so corny.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.521
By corny, do you mean the most
romantic movie of all time?

03:32.572 --> 03:36.158
Especially when Richard Gere climbs up
Julia Roberts' fire escape with roses.

03:36.192 --> 03:37.192
See?

03:37.193 --> 03:39.194
No guy would ever do that.

03:39.196 --> 03:41.413
Why not just go through the front door?

03:42.532 --> 03:47.369
Because he wants to make a grand gesture
to show how much he cares about her.

03:50.173 --> 03:52.207
You're such a girl.

03:54.594 --> 03:56.428
Oh! What a day I've had.

03:56.462 --> 03:58.463
The bridal shop had a Summer sale.

03:58.514 --> 04:00.132
I hate sales.

04:00.183 --> 04:03.318
I mean, if you can't afford to pay full
price, you don't deserve anything nice.

04:05.989 --> 04:08.657
- What are you guys doing?
- Celebrating my birthday.

04:09.809 --> 04:11.493
Of course!

04:12.562 --> 04:16.447
Which is why I rushed over
here for my Juju's big day.

04:19.289 --> 04:23.312
So should I save the best present
for last or should I open yours now?

04:23.313 --> 04:25.044
- Uh, Juju...
- You know what? Screw it.

04:25.045 --> 04:27.884
- It's my birthday. I wanna open yours now.
- Josh, I, uh... I...

04:27.885 --> 04:30.002
Oh, I get what you're doing.

04:30.003 --> 04:33.044
I get it. She's pretending like
she didn't get me a present.

04:35.179 --> 04:37.733
But... but she did, 'cause she
wouldn't forget my birthday.

04:39.614 --> 04:44.375
- Seriously, Josh, I...
- Uh, Caroline, Caroline.

04:44.410 --> 04:45.882
How long are you gonna torture the man?

04:45.883 --> 04:49.188
She had me wrap her gift to you...

04:49.189 --> 04:50.850
so I'll just... it's on
the counter.

04:50.851 --> 04:55.400
That's right, Juju. And don't you
dare ask for a hint before you open it.

04:56.445 --> 04:59.552
Here you go, Juju, with all my love.

<i>- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.</i>

05:19.324 --> 05:22.093
You knit me a replica of
the blanket my Nana gave me?

05:22.110 --> 05:24.895
The one that I lost in the fire?

05:24.947 --> 05:26.030
Did I?

05:27.582 --> 05:28.933
Did I!

05:29.967 --> 05:31.801
With my own two hands.

05:31.836 --> 05:34.638
Yeah, she saw
a picture of you with it

05:34.672 --> 05:36.712
when you were a kid, and
so she took crochet classes

05:36.736 --> 05:38.287
so she could learn how to make it.

05:39.143 --> 05:40.310
W-wow.

05:41.278 --> 05:42.846
Caroline, this is amazing.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.913
I know.

05:45.182 --> 05:47.302
Well, it should be. It took
her three weeks to make it.

05:49.686 --> 05:52.588
- This is it.
- I... I think so.

05:52.622 --> 05:56.025
We... we didn't wrap anything else, did we?

05:58.328 --> 05:59.845
This is what I needed.

06:00.864 --> 06:02.031
Look, I'm not gonna lie.

06:02.033 --> 06:04.113
I've been really stressed
this week with the wedding,

06:04.137 --> 06:06.885
but... the woman who would give me this,

06:06.936 --> 06:09.624
that's the woman that knows my heart...

06:11.540 --> 06:14.075
And the woman I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

06:23.508 --> 06:28.183
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hi, Caroline.

06:31.031 --> 06:34.968
I just wanted to thank you for your
magnanimous gesture with Josh's present.

06:35.002 --> 06:37.504
Oh! You are very welcome.

06:37.555 --> 06:39.539
"Magnanimous" is a good thing, right?

06:41.308 --> 06:44.077
Absolutely. Now how much do I owe you?

06:44.128 --> 06:47.147
Oh! No, Caroline, you don't have to pay me.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.082
Oh, but you saved me.
I mean, I would've hated

06:49.084 --> 06:51.217
to upset Josh with the
wedding being so close.

06:51.252 --> 06:54.554
Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, the
look on his face was payment enough.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.489
Yeah. Yeah, listen. I'd love it...

06:56.540 --> 06:59.292
If this could
be our little secret.

06:59.326 --> 07:01.294
If what could
be our little secret?

07:03.164 --> 07:07.189
- The gift that I just...
- yeah yeah, I'm kidding.

07:08.698 --> 07:10.237
Thank you, Gabi.

07:10.238 --> 07:12.294
You know my name.

07:12.295 --> 07:15.083
Oh, good. I almost went with "Libby".

07:24.382 --> 07:26.116
That blanket was from you?

07:27.318 --> 07:29.719
Yeah, isn't that funny?

07:29.754 --> 07:33.490
And the look on his face...
did you see how happy he was?

07:33.524 --> 07:36.626
And now he knows for sure
that Caroline is the one.

07:36.661 --> 07:38.562
Yay me!

07:39.530 --> 07:41.181
Is there ice cream?

07:46.970 --> 07:48.704
When can we expect the bride?

07:48.739 --> 07:51.440
Uh, she is running late,
but she is on her way.

07:51.475 --> 07:53.326
Oh, my God.

07:54.311 --> 07:56.145
Look at this place!

07:56.179 --> 07:58.682
Oh, wow.

07:58.683 --> 08:01.482
It is all happening.

08:01.483 --> 08:06.214
Yup, Josh is getting married,
and what a lovely venue.

08:06.215 --> 08:09.013
You know, it's very classy.
It's... is there an open bar?

08:10.300 --> 08:11.856
This is just a rehearsal.

08:12.519 --> 08:16.306
Sorry to rush you, but I have to
be at a circumcision, so chop chop.

08:17.606 --> 08:18.906
I thought rabbis did that.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.602
It's an interfaith
ceremony I'm co-officiating,

08:21.637 --> 08:24.205
and I really want to be
there for the tip-off.

08:24.939 --> 08:28.509
Is there anyone who can
step in for the bride?

08:28.543 --> 08:30.677
I can, I can, I can!

08:30.712 --> 08:33.330
Perfect! How about her?

08:33.381 --> 08:34.481
Me?

08:34.515 --> 08:37.083
Oh... no.

08:37.135 --> 08:39.019
No no no no no no.

08:39.020 --> 08:41.989
No, I'm sure Caroline
will be here very soon,

08:42.023 --> 08:44.925
so thank you very much, but absolutely not.

08:45.659 --> 08:49.162
"We are gathered here
today," blah blah blah.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.999
Someone reads a poem. We've
got some Bible stuff...

08:53.033 --> 08:55.935
God said this, God said that.

08:55.970 --> 09:02.437
We do your vows. I love you, you love me...
people cry and the rings go on the fingers.

09:02.438 --> 09:05.229
Yes, and "I now pronounce
you man and wife,"

09:05.230 --> 09:07.191
and they kiss and everything's
great, so I'm gonna go, okay?

09:07.192 --> 09:09.648
Wait wait, Gabi, do you
mind if I practice my vows

09:09.649 --> 09:11.268
since Caroline's not
here? Is that all right?

09:11.269 --> 09:12.885
Could you make it quick, son?

09:12.886 --> 09:15.120
That penis isn't gonna cut itself.

09:15.730 --> 09:17.208
I just wanna make sure it's perfect.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.157
"Caroline...

09:20.426 --> 09:24.849
From the moment I saw you,
I was absolutely taken.

09:26.398 --> 09:28.238
You're the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen,

09:28.266 --> 09:30.100
and not just on the outside.

09:30.135 --> 09:33.104
Your inner beauty is what truly shines.

09:33.905 --> 09:37.772
And you gave me the most thoughtful
gift anyone has ever given me.

09:37.773 --> 09:39.893
Yes yes, her love. We get it.

09:39.894 --> 09:41.487
No no, I'm talking about the blanket.

09:41.488 --> 09:44.654
That blanket embodies
your love, Caroline...

09:44.655 --> 09:49.385
gentle, kind and absolutely
unique to the two of us.

09:51.059 --> 09:55.367
I love it and I love you for
knowing how much it meant to me".

09:55.368 --> 09:58.827
Uh, yes, and then...

09:58.828 --> 10:02.005
and then Caroline would
probably say something like...

10:02.006 --> 10:04.599
The blanket is really no big deal.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.437
And how when she gave it to you,

10:07.438 --> 10:09.888
she had no idea that it would
make this much of an impact

10:09.889 --> 10:13.974
and P.S., you probably have to
hand-wash it, and that's a hassle.

10:13.975 --> 10:17.776
I hope she'd say something
just a little more romantic.

10:17.777 --> 10:20.354
Hey, you know what? I'd just be
glad to know she'd do laundry.

10:20.355 --> 10:23.804
Of course she's gonna
say something romantic,

10:23.805 --> 10:29.788
like... how, even in this gorgeous
setting, all she sees is you,

10:29.789 --> 10:33.772
and how you make her excited
to get up every morning,

10:33.773 --> 10:40.180
and when you're apart, she's always
thinking in you and how to make you happy.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.724
Oh, my damn.

10:43.149 --> 10:45.020
Juju! I'm here!

10:45.021 --> 10:48.102
Sorry I'm late!

10:51.000 --> 10:53.122
What? You're hurting me.

10:53.123 --> 10:57.119
Josh is excited to marry
the girl who made him that blanket,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.117
only Caroline's not the girl who made it.

10:59.118 --> 11:00.903
Gabi is.

11:00.904 --> 11:02.304
So?

11:02.305 --> 11:06.218
So we need to tell him who
that gift really is from.

11:06.219 --> 11:07.777
Are you crazy?

11:07.778 --> 11:09.574
You can't tell Josh that gift was from you.

11:09.575 --> 11:10.975
But if I don't, then
he'll be marrying Caroline

11:10.976 --> 11:13.063
under false pretenses, then that could lead

11:13.064 --> 11:14.906
to a very painful divorce and
then it would all be my fault.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.995
Okay, you know what I think?

11:16.996 --> 11:19.030
I think that Josh moving up his wedding

11:19.031 --> 11:21.288
has made you just spin a
little bit out of control,

11:21.289 --> 11:23.808
then standing at that altar
just put you right over the top,

11:23.809 --> 11:26.127
- and now...
- You're out of your mind!

11:26.128 --> 11:27.880
Josh needs to know the truth.

11:27.881 --> 11:30.717
Trust me, as someone who's
been with a married man,

11:30.718 --> 11:34.112
the truth and marriage do not go together.

11:34.113 --> 11:37.094
But truth is the foundation
of any good marriage.

11:37.095 --> 11:39.784
Gabi, you have told me over and over again

11:39.785 --> 11:41.530
that all you care about
is Josh being happy.

11:41.531 --> 11:43.613
Right? Well, look at him.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.162
He's happy.

11:46.196 --> 11:48.130
- He loves her.
- And if you tell him,

11:48.165 --> 11:49.732
you're gonna break his heart.

11:49.766 --> 11:50.766
Is that what you want?

11:50.767 --> 11:53.469
- No.
- No.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.274
Who's psyched for this wedding?

12:03.580 --> 12:05.681
Josh, I need you to go
with your first instinct...

12:05.715 --> 12:08.250
- silver plate or gold leaf?
- Gold leaf.

12:08.252 --> 12:10.765
Good choice, because
I ordered them already.

12:10.766 --> 12:12.723
Look, I'm Madonna.

12:14.332 --> 12:15.610
That's funny.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.724
Everything is funny, Elliot.

12:17.725 --> 12:19.492
God, what was I so worried about before?

12:19.493 --> 12:22.947
Lifelong commitment, your
march towards middle age,

12:22.948 --> 12:24.906
having a stroke... a bunch of stuff.

12:25.694 --> 12:28.516
See, that would have made me
nervous, but it all changed

12:28.517 --> 12:30.564
when Caroline gave me this.

12:30.565 --> 12:33.567
Enough with the blanket already!

12:33.568 --> 12:35.752
If Caroline didn't give it to you,

12:35.753 --> 12:37.775
you'd still love her for other things.

12:37.776 --> 12:39.706
I mean, look at the rack on her.

12:40.202 --> 12:42.642
Wait, the rack is the boobs, right?

12:42.643 --> 12:44.809
Elliot...

12:44.810 --> 12:47.286
This is why I love you...

12:47.287 --> 12:51.246
And why I'd be honored
if you'd be my best man.

12:51.247 --> 12:53.130
Oh my God.

12:53.131 --> 12:55.684
I've dreamed of this moment my whole life.

12:55.685 --> 12:57.509
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.013
I'd love to!

12:59.014 --> 13:01.733
Hey, you've been my friend, my
support system and my confidant.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.504
There's no one I trust more than you.

13:03.505 --> 13:07.476
You're not just my best
man. You're my best friend.

13:08.810 --> 13:09.836
Son of a bitch!

13:12.722 --> 13:14.523
Not what I was expecting to hear.

13:14.557 --> 13:17.592
You really love that blanket that much?

13:18.661 --> 13:20.295
Yeah. Why?

13:21.297 --> 13:22.481
Oh God.

13:22.532 --> 13:25.167
I'm just gonna pull
it off like a band-aid.

13:26.402 --> 13:28.053
Gabi made you that blanket.

13:28.087 --> 13:29.838
Caroline forgot your birthday

13:29.872 --> 13:33.622
and Gabi let Caroline say
the present was from her.

13:36.011 --> 13:36.911
What?

13:36.945 --> 13:38.679
The blanket's from Gabi!

13:38.681 --> 13:40.614
The blanket's from Gabi!

13:43.535 --> 13:45.219
I don't believe this.

13:45.253 --> 13:47.188
I'm really sorry.

13:47.222 --> 13:49.957
Do you want me to light
that blanket on fire, too?

13:52.060 --> 13:53.220
I think I just need a minute.

14:04.238 --> 14:07.642
Hey, I need to see you.

14:15.029 --> 14:18.398
Juju, what's going on?

14:18.432 --> 14:19.832
You know it's bad luck for the groom

14:19.866 --> 14:22.066
to have sex with the bride
the night before the wedding.

14:28.275 --> 14:29.876
Where did you learn how to crochet?

14:30.911 --> 14:32.812
Are we role-playing?

14:32.846 --> 14:34.697
Am I the seamstress?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.351
Caroline, how did you make my blanket?

14:39.620 --> 14:41.221
All right, you caught me.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.307
I had a special blanket
person make it for you.

14:46.994 --> 14:49.980
I know it was Gabi's gift.

14:53.633 --> 14:54.833
Well, it's not a big deal.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.636
I mean, I was just so
busy with the wedding.

14:57.670 --> 15:00.606
You're gonna have hundreds of birthdays
that we can celebrate together.

15:04.143 --> 15:05.743
What's my favorite color?

15:05.778 --> 15:06.811
What?

15:07.546 --> 15:09.480
Do you know what college I went to?

15:09.514 --> 15:11.315
Or...

15:11.349 --> 15:12.883
What my middle name is?

15:12.918 --> 15:14.818
Don't be silly.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.887
Of course I don't know those things.

15:18.690 --> 15:22.446
Your favorite color is ecru, which is the
same as off-white but it's more elegant.

15:22.447 --> 15:25.376
You went to Barnard over Bryn Mawr
because a girl named Bryn at riding camp

15:25.377 --> 15:26.686
said your horse was fat,

15:26.687 --> 15:29.125
and your middle name is Penelope.

15:31.752 --> 15:33.981
That must be what my therapist meant today

15:33.982 --> 15:35.970
when he said our
relationship was one-sided.

15:36.005 --> 15:38.064
Wait, you saw your therapist today?

15:38.065 --> 15:41.980
I... I had a little freak-out
before the rehearsal.

15:41.981 --> 15:44.776
I needed an emergency phone session...

15:44.777 --> 15:46.333
And a valium.

15:47.566 --> 15:49.319
So...

15:49.320 --> 15:51.375
You've been having doubts, too?

15:51.376 --> 15:53.315
Yes...

15:53.316 --> 15:56.263
But not about loving you.

15:56.264 --> 15:58.192
I mean, can't we just get married

15:58.193 --> 16:00.467
and figure this out
later like normal people?

16:00.468 --> 16:03.213
I'm sorry, Caroline, I can't.

16:08.370 --> 16:10.304
I think we should call the wedding off.

16:12.441 --> 16:15.009
I think it would be best for both of us.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.447
Are you gonna be all right?

16:20.816 --> 16:22.383
I'll be fine.

16:24.319 --> 16:26.220
I'll always have tons of money.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.679
No, keep it.

16:35.730 --> 16:36.730
I bought it for you.

16:37.632 --> 16:38.799
No.

16:41.469 --> 16:43.336
You bought it for the
girl you're gonna marry.

16:53.914 --> 16:55.874
What are you doing here?
It's 1:00 in the morning.

16:55.898 --> 16:57.950
I forgot to put the wash in the dryer.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.819
I can't sleep if I don't finish my job.

17:00.904 --> 17:02.455
Since when?

17:03.657 --> 17:05.374
Since I was worried about you.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.599
How'd it go with Caroline?

17:08.627 --> 17:10.494
We broke it off.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.297
I had a feeling.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.885
You know what you need right now?

17:16.935 --> 17:18.102
A hug?

17:19.088 --> 17:22.022
Yup, a hug from Jack Daniels.

17:26.645 --> 17:29.481
Oh, oh, you got the expensive stuff.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.249
Let's switch.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.288
I should have known.

17:37.323 --> 17:40.925
I should have known. Caroline's never
done anything like that for me before.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.240
It had Gabi written all over it.

17:45.029 --> 17:46.730
She's amazing.

17:46.764 --> 17:49.466
Yeah, she's something special, that girl.

17:53.771 --> 17:55.405
I'm about to do something crazy.

17:55.456 --> 17:58.825
I'm thinking about going over to Gabi's,
and I don't know what I'm gonna tell her,

17:58.849 --> 18:00.127
but I just... I need to see her.

18:00.178 --> 18:03.018
And I... is this stupid? Yolanda,
you'd tell me if this is stupid, right?

18:12.556 --> 18:14.423
Go big or go home.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.534
Hm, still raining out.

18:26.535 --> 18:31.905
<i>That is really gonna put a
damper on the reception bummer..</i>

18:33.042 --> 18:34.075
Gabi...

18:34.109 --> 18:35.243
It's time to let it go.

18:36.178 --> 18:38.880
Josh is marrying somebody
else tomorrow, okay?

18:38.914 --> 18:41.783
You're frosting the cake for his wedding.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.885
I know, I know, and I've accepted that.

18:43.887 --> 18:47.322
I just... I can't help but wonder if...

18:47.356 --> 18:49.657
No. No more wondering.

18:49.675 --> 18:51.626
I believe in fate.

18:52.677 --> 18:57.030
What's meant to be will be
and true love always wins.

18:57.065 --> 19:00.300
Gabi, real life is not like "Pretty Woman".

19:00.335 --> 19:02.202
You're not a hooker.

19:02.237 --> 19:05.739
The man you love isn't gonna
come climbing up the fire escape,

19:05.741 --> 19:06.874
declaring his love.

19:06.908 --> 19:08.809
Men don't run through airports,

19:08.843 --> 19:11.203
and they don't knock on the
door in the middle of the night,

19:11.227 --> 19:13.330
expressing their undying love for you.

19:13.381 --> 19:15.315
That stuff... that just doesn't happen.

19:25.620 --> 19:27.155
Okay, open it.

19:32.616 --> 19:33.616
Oh my God.

19:34.902 --> 19:37.503
Cooper, I thought you were in China.

19:37.537 --> 19:42.078
Yeah, well, I flew all the way
back, because I had to see you.

19:43.327 --> 19:45.111
Wow.

19:45.145 --> 19:49.441
Well, I'll just be in my
room... Watching "Pretty Woman".

19:51.851 --> 19:53.134
Uh, do you want to come in?

19:53.169 --> 19:54.686
That'd be nice.

19:55.871 --> 19:58.089
I'm sorry, I know it's
late. I mean, for you.

19:58.124 --> 19:59.891
For me I'm still on Beijing time,

19:59.893 --> 20:01.910
which is like 15 hours
ahead. Making it roughly...

20:01.961 --> 20:03.762
4:30 in the afternoon my time,
which doesn't really matter

20:03.764 --> 20:05.513
'cause you're still up. But you know me,

20:05.564 --> 20:07.964
I'm a numbers guy, which is why
this is all so amazing for me.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.602
What... what's so amazing to you?

20:12.221 --> 20:15.872
When I was in China, I found
this and I had to bring it to you.

20:15.873 --> 20:18.218
You brought me a gift from China?

20:19.218 --> 20:21.312
I couldn't wait to see your
face when you opened it.

20:22.981 --> 20:26.116
Oh, Julia Child's first cookbook.

20:26.151 --> 20:30.955
I know you probably have it already, but
this one's a first edition and it's signed.

20:30.989 --> 20:32.122
No way.

20:34.092 --> 20:37.761
"You're the butter to
my bread. Love, Julia".

20:37.812 --> 20:39.563
Thank you.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.334
That's the face.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.569
That's the face I pictured
halfway around the world.

20:48.339 --> 20:49.973
Cooper, I don't know what to say.

20:50.007 --> 20:51.307
I mean, this is...

20:51.309 --> 20:55.962
this is the most thoughtful gift that
anybody's ever given me, like, ever.

20:55.997 --> 21:01.051
Gabi, the whole time I was in China
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.803
I literally got off the
plane and started running.

21:04.855 --> 21:06.175
You ran through an airport for me?

21:06.199 --> 21:07.941
Yeah.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.810
I mean, I used the people movers,
but I was definitely running.

21:10.861 --> 21:11.978
Gabi...
