00:06.640 --> 00:09.477
Previously on "Shooter"...
I need to talk to Kasper.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.011
Alexander Prosovich gave
me this number.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.182
You're talking to him,
Mr. Swagger.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.016
Voydian left
information for me.

00:16.117 --> 00:19.019
They're all written by the same
journalist, Karlina Ordenko.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.222
Something about a city
called Graznyole.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.556
Dimitri Voydian.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.225
One day you roll him up.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.294
Next day he's
found in pieces.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.295
[grunts]
[groans]

00:27.395 --> 00:28.429
Annex B.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.030
Looks like we've been
hiring PMCs

00:30.131 --> 00:31.399
to handle off-book black ops.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.334
This has war crimes
written all over it.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.436
Somebody saw us looking into
this and they shut us down.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.271
We're taking custody of him.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.707
He's in violation of numerous
articles of the UCMJ.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.041
Who do I need
to talk to then?

00:41.142 --> 00:42.343
The Secretary of the Army.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.411
HOWARD: It just doesn't add up.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.412
Do you believe me now?

00:44.512 --> 00:46.147
Yes, I believe you now.

00:46.247 --> 00:47.481
We need to talk
about your bullet.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.150
There are four rifles
in the world

00:49.250 --> 00:51.185
that are strong enough to fire
a bullet like this one.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.354
That's a Black King, and that's
one of them right there.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.390
You find the other Black Kings,
you find your shooter.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.729
[smooth rock music]

01:01.829 --> 01:08.769
*

01:35.396 --> 01:42.403
*

01:49.410 --> 01:51.412
HOWARD: Until we know if
there's a mole in the building,

01:51.512 --> 01:53.214
we're gonna have
to keep up appearances.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.448
That means I'm gonna have
to grill you

01:54.548 --> 01:55.716
on everything Swagger-related.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.817
Understood, sir.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.852
Where is he?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.188
NADINE: I have no idea.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.156
HOWARD: Does he have a plan?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.558
NADINE: Yeah, he's looking
for the real shooter.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.659
I honestly
don't know much more.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.827
He's not very talkative.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.396
HOWARD: Stay close to him.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.563
Keep building that trust.

02:09.663 --> 02:10.831
NADINE: Will do.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.300
Unfortunately with Payne gone,

02:12.400 --> 02:13.734
my leads on
the Voydian connection

02:13.834 --> 02:15.736
to this whole thing
have gone cold.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.439
But I'm still convinced the
Russians are behind everything.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.707
HOWARD: All right,
if we do this,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.709
we need to do it
by the book.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.711
So we can't let on we know
how deep this thing goes.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.280
It's just business as usual.

02:26.380 --> 02:33.321
*

03:02.516 --> 03:09.523
*

03:18.699 --> 03:20.668
I read your file
on the Russians.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.902
It's well done.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.504
Thank you, sir.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.673
Just because they all have
ties to Dimitri Voydian

03:25.773 --> 03:27.808
doesn't necessarily mean
that Payne killed them.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.344
Oh, and it doesn't exactly
scream conspiracy.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.314
Karlina Ordenko,
I need to speak to her.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.849
So speak to her.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.268
JULIE: Hey you.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.736
Mary finally went to sleep,

03:55.836 --> 03:57.938
so I have a minute
to say hi.

03:58.038 --> 04:01.709
Tonight we had mint chocolate
chip, your favorite.

04:01.809 --> 04:05.579
Somehow we finished
the whole pint.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.581
I wish you were here.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.718
It's the simple moments
when I miss you the most.

04:10.818 --> 04:14.788
MAN: * Hot hands
you're on to my neck *

04:14.888 --> 04:18.792
* Black boots
and her French heritage *

04:18.892 --> 04:21.795
BOBBY LEE:
I wish I was there, too.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.732
If it's any comfort,
I'm making progress.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.868
This is almost over,
I promise.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.471
I love you.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.272
MAN: * Afraid

04:32.373 --> 04:37.545
* Do you get afraid,
afraid, afraid *

04:37.645 --> 04:42.716
*

04:42.816 --> 04:45.052
ANNE: Jules, have you seen
Mary's tutu?

04:45.152 --> 04:46.554
She wants to wear it.

04:46.654 --> 04:47.855
Yeah, it's just
in the top drawer.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.823
Uh-uh, she rearranged
everything.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.058
I can't find it.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.694
[scoffs]
What?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.496
I will come help you.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.787

LONNIE: Jack, come on in.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.763
Jesus, Lon,
what did you do,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.032
steal these chairs
from the Lollypop Guild?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.435
[both laugh]

06:07.535 --> 06:09.102
Anyway, thanks for
getting me out.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.706
Didn't really give me
much of a choice, did you?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.141
You're in good spirits
for someone whose face

06:14.241 --> 06:16.810
was plastered
all over the news.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.480
All missions
suffer setbacks.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.014
Yeah, a flat tire
is a setback.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.883
You're fully blown, Jack.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.854
In the most spectacular way
possible, I might add.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.822
I think you should retire.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.691
You'll be well compensated,

06:30.791 --> 06:32.960
and we'll set you up
someplace nice.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.462
How does Fiji sound?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.830
[chuckles]

06:36.930 --> 06:40.501
Uh, ahoy there, Captain Bligh.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.570
[both laugh]

06:42.670 --> 06:46.740
Look, that sounds
not so good, Lon.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.610
I mean, come on, man,
you can't touch me.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.446
Okay, and I ain't
going to Fiji

06:52.546 --> 06:54.682
or anywhere else.

06:54.782 --> 06:58.452
I want $10 million or
I'm going public with that.

06:58.552 --> 07:01.421
Now, the resolution is shitty.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.024
It's a cell phone video
of my laptop screen.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.627
The original is way better.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.829
Just like every page
of the complete,

07:08.929 --> 07:11.031
unredacted copy
of the Annex B file,

07:11.131 --> 07:15.969
which I also have
in my possession.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.472
So you had the evidence
all along?

07:18.572 --> 07:19.907
Yeah.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.042
I took it from
Dimitri Voydian's body.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.746
I thought it might make
a good insurance plan.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.615
I guess I was right.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.216
No.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.485
You were wrong.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.954
See, had you come in here

07:34.054 --> 07:36.089
and given me a thumb drive,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.726
I would have rewarded you.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.965
And why would I do that?

07:45.065 --> 07:46.634
Oh, I don't know.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.136
Loyalty, for one.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.574
Because it would have
engendered my gratitude.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.510
And because I've always
considered you a friend.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.182
Yeah, well, you talk real nice

08:02.282 --> 08:04.685
for a guy who has me
surrounded by armed guards.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.119
[chuckles]

08:06.219 --> 08:08.522
Jack, if I wanted to kill you,

08:08.622 --> 08:10.558
I would have had you
thrown out of my jet

08:10.658 --> 08:13.627
at 35,000 feet.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.228
Are you really this stupid?

08:15.328 --> 08:19.066
I'm not giving you
$10 million or anything.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.903
From now on,
you're on your own.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.613
Well, then I guess I'll just
have to go to the Feds.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.049
Go ahead.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.686
And by the way,
it's Captain Ahab

08:38.786 --> 08:40.788
who had one leg,
from "Moby Dick."

08:40.888 --> 08:42.590
I'll get you a copy.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.292
You'll need something to read
while you're awaiting trial.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.830
Good seeing you.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.307
[dog barking]

09:10.183 --> 09:13.587
Colonel Singer.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.922
Who?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.057
You've known Colonel Singer
all your life,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.759
and now out of the blue
he's accessing

09:18.859 --> 09:22.562
classified files
on Annex B?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.832
You dug his grave when
you asked him to help you.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.001
Now you gotta fill it.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.569
Singer doesn't know anything.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.872
He knows you.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.842
And he knows about Annex B.

09:34.942 --> 09:40.013
There's careful,
and then there's paranoid.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.182
Singer's not dangerous.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.985
And he's not
some old lady either.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.887
People will miss him.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.989
You know...

09:49.089 --> 09:53.160
I think you're
forgetting your place.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.595
My place?

09:55.696 --> 09:57.931
Who the hell do you
think you are?

09:58.031 --> 10:02.235
You're a drunk with
a security clearance.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.271
And you're that asshole

10:04.371 --> 10:06.306
who thought he could
outsmart me.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.778
Now work out your bullshit

10:10.878 --> 10:13.914
and then you
go deal with Singer.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.176
You are friend of Alexi?

10:43.276 --> 10:44.377
Not exactly.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.346
I'm a Special Agent
with the FBI.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.148
Just need a few
moments of your time.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.217
[mutters in Russian]

10:50.317 --> 10:52.152
I am very busy woman,
Miss FBI.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.254
I have no time
to be harassed.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.924
A Ukranian journalist
by the name of Karlina Ordenko

10:57.024 --> 10:58.058
has gone missing.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.160
I need to talk to her.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.661
I'd be very grateful
if you could make

11:01.762 --> 11:05.332
some discreet inquiries.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.334
[sighs]

11:07.434 --> 11:11.238
I'm afraid
I cannot help you.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.207
The FBI is already aware
of a number

11:14.307 --> 11:19.212
of potentially illegal
operations with ties to you.

you would have
already used it.

You're right, I would.
Move in.

an illegal casino on 8th,
two brothels,

Uh, I am, yeah, sir.

damn fine shooting.

It sure was, man,

but it was your bullets
that gave him the edge.

He should split
his winnings with you.

to unload some of
Daddy's rifles.

around here at the show

in an original 1941 Johnson?

over to you.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.052
Said you might be able
to help me out.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
Okay, well,
if you're looking to sell,

13:41.254 --> 13:42.822
it would have to be
something special.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.491
I'm only interested
in the best.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.327
Well, what's the fanciest
rifle you got?

13:47.427 --> 13:50.363
What, you trying to gauge
the price before you show me?

13:50.463 --> 13:51.831
[chuckles]

13:51.932 --> 13:53.033
[laughs]

13:53.133 --> 13:54.501
That's okay.

13:54.601 --> 13:56.203
That's okay,
I don't blame you.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.906
Smart play.
Smart play.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.908
But here's the thing.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.976
Most long guns
aren't worth much more

14:03.076 --> 14:04.277
than what you pay for 'em.
Mm.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.046
Often less.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.448
Well, what about, like,
a real special gun?

14:08.548 --> 14:11.418
Like this one I read about,
uh, the Black King.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.386
You got a Black King
in there?

14:13.486 --> 14:16.123
[both laugh]

14:16.223 --> 14:18.525
Man, don't I wish.
Shit.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.028
I wish, too.

14:21.128 --> 14:22.395
But they only made four?

14:22.495 --> 14:24.497
Yeah.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.900
Here.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.402
Let me show you something.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.106
Wow.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.541
Yeah.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.310
Now, each of
the individual guns,

14:37.410 --> 14:39.046
marked with its own king.

14:39.146 --> 14:42.249
See what we got here?
We got the King of Clubs.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.451
Holy shit.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.519
You ever fire it?

14:46.619 --> 14:49.156
Have I ever fired it?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.191
Here.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.461
See that?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.664
Shot that from 883 yards.

14:57.764 --> 14:59.666
That's impressive.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.201
Yeah, well,
that's nothing

15:01.301 --> 15:03.070
compared to what
this guy can do.

15:03.170 --> 15:04.171
Here.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.272
Here, hang on.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.506
Look at this.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.175

15:34.267 --> 15:35.668
Yeah, I just--
I just got this yesterday.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.139
I mean,
it's great timing for me.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.640
What's that guy's name?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.475
Uh, Lon Scott.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.711
Lon Scott.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.246
He's a hell of a shooter.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.580
Oh, yeah.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.688
Hold on there a second.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.590
Anyone ever tell you
you look like the marine

15:57.690 --> 15:59.259
who took a shot
at the President?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.094
Swagger?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.563
No, man, sorry.
Wrong guy.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.132
I just want to have
a better look.

Why don't you get out
of my face?

16:48.241 --> 16:49.542
I think we found our shooter.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.478
Name's Lon Scott.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.547
I just saw a video of him
firing a Black King.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.316
Lon Scott?

16:56.416 --> 16:59.086
CEO of Anhur Dynamics?
That doesn't make any sense.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.054
Not yet, anyway.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.522
So I'm headed out to their
Virginia headquarters

17:02.622 --> 17:04.124
to give 'em a visit,

17:04.224 --> 17:05.225

the pieces together.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.626
Oh, and, uh...

17:06.726 --> 17:08.528
I got into a little jam
in Bozeman.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.497
If it ends up
on the FBI's radar,

17:10.597 --> 17:12.165
you might want
to squash that for me.

there was a shooting

17:25.778 --> 17:27.114

One wounded,
non-life-threatening.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.118

That's a relief.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.685
It would be
if several witnesses

17:32.785 --> 17:35.155
didn't see Swagger
in the middle of the melee.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.656
Any proof?

All right, look, I know
you're talking to him.

26:23.015 --> 26:23.950
Dynamics.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.752
Say again?
Karlina--

26:25.852 --> 26:29.221
[static] ...responsible
for many, many death.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.958
I-I can't understand you.
Karlina, you're breaking up.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.092
[glass shatters]
Oh--Oh, my God.

26:34.026 --> 26:34.060
They found me!
They found me!

26:34.694 --> 26:36.062
Karlina?
[screams]

26:36.162 --> 26:37.196
Karlina!

26:37.296 --> 26:38.330
Karlina?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.332
[clattering, Karlina screaming]

26:40.432 --> 26:41.333
Karlina?

26:41.433 --> 26:43.369
[loud thuds]

26:51.077 --> 26:53.079
[speaking Russian]

26:54.313 --> 26:56.315

27:10.629 --> 27:14.667
[phone buzzes]

27:15.467 --> 27:15.501
Yeah, what?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.037
You got a big problem.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.807
He found the shooter.

27:22.274 --> 27:23.943
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:24.043 --> 27:25.377
Lon Scott.
It's him, right?

27:25.477 --> 27:26.913
You calling
from a secure line?

27:27.013 --> 27:28.347
Oh, now you're concerned
if shit is secure?

27:28.447 --> 27:29.949
I asked you a damn question.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.283
Is Lon Scott the shooter?

27:31.383 --> 27:34.053
[clears throat]

27:34.153 --> 27:36.088
The guy is basically
Howard Hughes.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.957
He's completely
off the grid.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.325
No way he'd expose himself.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.060
He exposed himself all right.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.195
He unzipped his fly
all the way down.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.064
Bob Lee is headed
to Virginia.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.099
I'm guessing he's planning
a rendezvous.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.068
Lon has plenty of protection,
trust me.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.970
Do you realize how
completely screwed we are?

27:51.070 --> 27:53.239
The CIA hired a private
military contractor

27:53.339 --> 27:55.975
to assassinate a foreign
national on American soil.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.710
It's a mouthful.

28:01.180 --> 28:06.352
This thing started out as bad
and now it's worse.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.154
If I were you,
I'd be packing bags.

28:08.254 --> 28:10.823
I don't have any bags,
Johnson.

28:10.923 --> 28:13.259
How 'bout you?

28:13.359 --> 28:14.426
Asshole.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.876
Freaky, huh?

28:29.976 --> 28:33.712
Sort of like Elvis.

28:33.813 --> 28:36.715
I hate it when the media
won't let something go.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.818
ANNE: Lunch is ready.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.253
Mary, come on.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.327
Last chance to answer
the question.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.130
We would all be implicated.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.731
You know I'm right.

28:52.832 --> 28:55.134
Right about what?

28:55.234 --> 28:56.468
Nothing.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.038
Jim was just mentioning
how the media

28:59.138 --> 29:02.341
can't seem to move on
from everything.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.343
I'll go get Mary.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.220
Jesus Christ, Memphis.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.922
Can't this wait
till I get upstairs?

29:16.022 --> 29:18.224
Karlina Ordenko is dead.

29:18.324 --> 29:20.092
She was murdered last night
while I watched.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.828
Oh--Oh, my God.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.429
They found me!
They found me!

29:23.529 --> 29:24.831
[clattering, screaming]

29:29.235 --> 29:30.937
Who?

29:31.037 --> 29:32.371
They were definitely
professionals,

29:32.471 --> 29:35.041
Russian FSB or worse.

29:35.141 --> 29:37.910
[speaking Russian]

29:38.911 --> 29:40.446
Sir, they know who I am.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.081
It's time that
we handed this off.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.449
I'm gonna get us a sit-down
with the director.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.819
No. I mean,
we can't prove anything.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.354
I can't even find
any articles she's written

29:48.454 --> 29:51.490
other than the ones
we printed.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.125
She's being erased.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.832
Going somewhere?

29:59.932 --> 30:01.901
No, I just pack all
my belongings for exercise.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.970
Well, you can stop packing.
You're not going anywhere.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.504
Karlina Ordenko is dead.

30:05.604 --> 30:08.074
You sold her out.
You got her killed.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.977
You think I want
this kind of heat?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.811
I didn't get her killed.
You did.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.380
And now because of you,
I have to run.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.916
Who did this, Kasper?
Who killed her?

30:17.016 --> 30:18.450
If I had known you were
involving me with jackals

30:18.550 --> 30:20.286
like Grigory Krukov,
I would have told you

30:20.386 --> 30:21.487
to go f--- yourself.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.989
Who's Grigory Krukov?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.160
You want to arrest me?
Do it now.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.229
Otherwise get
the hell out of here.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.298
I'm done talking to you.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.366
People who talk to you
end up dead.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.306
[tense music]

30:40.406 --> 30:47.346
*

31:17.609 --> 31:20.980
You know Swagger's on
his way here, right?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.148
I'd hoped so.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.050
For the love of God, why?

31:24.150 --> 31:25.584
Because you failed.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.286
Now I'm gonna finish it.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.122
Swagger is a lot smarter
than any of us realized.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.424
Smarter than you.
Not us.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.327
Said by the guy posting videos
of himself on YouTube?

31:38.364 --> 31:40.532
Swagger is a hunter,

31:40.632 --> 31:45.004
possibly one of the best this
country has ever produced.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.638
If he thought
I was hunting him,

31:46.738 --> 31:48.407
he would have never come.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.409
The trick is to make him think
he's in control.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.178
Now he does.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.980
So the video worked.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.315
I don't mean
to be an asshole,

31:56.415 --> 31:58.384
but he's coming,

31:58.484 --> 32:00.186
he's coming hard.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.488
I appreciate
your concern, Hugh.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.156
But your paternal instincts

32:04.256 --> 32:07.559
would be better focused
on Jack Payne.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.097
Turns out he's had
the Annex B files all along.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.932
Please tell me he's locked up
somewhere in this building.

32:14.033 --> 32:17.369
No, but he won't be
hard to find.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.638
He wants $10 million
for the files.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.243
If I were you,
I'd pay him.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.178
Shit.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.447
Shit.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.349

33:17.596 --> 33:19.131
Yeah?

33:19.231 --> 33:23.302
*

33:23.402 --> 33:24.470
Thanks.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.784
Hi, I'm Special Agent
Nadine Memphis.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.252
Jim, right?

33:40.352 --> 33:41.387
Julie Swagger's
brother-in-law?

33:41.487 --> 33:43.689
Yes, yes.
Agent Memphis,

33:43.789 --> 33:46.125
I have something I think
you're gonna want to see.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.665
[indistinct chatter]

34:09.448 --> 34:11.383
Good afternoon.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.319
Hey, package for Lon Scott?

34:13.419 --> 34:14.486
I'll sign for it.

34:14.586 --> 34:17.356
It says here
he needs to sign.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.790
Mr. Scott isn't here.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.694
I can sign,
or you can send it back.

34:22.794 --> 34:26.132
I'll just leave it here.

34:32.704 --> 34:35.474
Hey, man, I think
you have a package for me.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.210
Don't think so.

34:38.310 --> 34:40.546
You mind checking
today's deliveries?

34:40.646 --> 34:43.849
It'd save me a trip downtown.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.717
Sure.
I'm parked over here.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.365
I'm not here to kill you.
I just want to talk, all right?

34:59.465 --> 35:01.167
Is that what you told
Donny's mom?

35:01.267 --> 35:02.301
I didn't have a choice.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.435
She was 70 years old, man.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.237
She didn't do a damn thing.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.573
If it wasn't me, it would
have been someone else.

35:07.673 --> 35:08.740
You shouldn't have gone there.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.442
You shouldn't have gone there!

35:12.678 --> 35:14.813
I just don't want
anyone else to get hurt.

35:14.913 --> 35:15.814
[scoffs]

35:22.921 --> 35:24.523
It's Claire.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.693
I just received an odd package
for Mr. Scott.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.428
If we don't start
working together--

35:29.528 --> 35:31.163
Together?

35:31.263 --> 35:33.432
You seem to be under
the assumption that I need you.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.701
I know you're on
to Lon Scott,

35:35.801 --> 35:38.304
and you are going
to need help.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.806
Those boys you encountered
back in Idaho,

35:40.906 --> 35:43.175
they're a tiny fraction
of the men he commands.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.843
Yeah, well, I left them
in the dirt.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.546
Someday I'm gonna do
the same thing to you.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.248
Whether or not
you want to admit it,

35:49.348 --> 35:50.916
you need my help.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.419
You can't stop
these guys alone.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.622
How far are you willing
to go, Captain Johnson?

35:56.722 --> 35:59.291
Are you willing to destroy
your life to save mine?

35:59.391 --> 36:01.293
Turn yourself in?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.195
Go to jail for killing
Donny's mom?

36:06.898 --> 36:08.834
I didn't think so.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.437
You're not trying to help me.
You're helping yourself.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.239
At this point,
there's no difference.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.307
Just because you realized
you're expendable,

36:15.407 --> 36:17.343
doesn't make us partners.

36:19.978 --> 36:22.414
That doesn't mean
we don't need to be.

36:36.362 --> 36:39.331
[intense music]

36:53.479 --> 36:53.645
.

36:53.712 --> 36:54.980
Don't worry.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.715
I can bury it on my end.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.217
I just wanted you to be aware
of the situation.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.287
I'll take care of it.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.455
Thanks for looking out.

37:06.358 --> 37:08.360
[door opens, closes]

37:19.571 --> 37:21.607
What the hell are you doing?
Shut up!

37:21.707 --> 37:23.742
You shut up.
You went to the FBI?

37:23.842 --> 37:26.745
I mean, how stupid
can you possibly be?

37:26.845 --> 37:29.581
You don't like me, Jim?
That's fine.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.717
You don't like Bob Lee?
That's fine.

37:31.817 --> 37:35.287
But if you ever, ever
threaten my daughter ever again,

37:35.387 --> 37:37.989
so help me God, I will
bury you in your own backyard

37:38.089 --> 37:40.492
and never think
about you again.

37:40.592 --> 37:41.727
Do you understand?

37:41.827 --> 37:43.995
Yes, yes, I understand.
Jesus.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.997
Jesus can't help you.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.767
You're leaving town now
on a business trip.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.336
On a business trip?

37:50.436 --> 37:52.304
You're not coming back
until this is over.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.040
Am I clear?
Am I clear?

37:55.140 --> 37:57.008
What about Anne?

37:57.108 --> 37:58.710
If my sister knew
what you did,

37:58.810 --> 38:02.581
she'd help me dig
the f---ing hole.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.616
Okay.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.689
Are you clear?
SINGER: Clear?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.290
Thanks to you,
I have to uproot my life

38:12.391 --> 38:14.393
and drag my wife
to Afghanistan.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.861
You really screwed me, man.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.062
I'm sorry, Justin.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.530
I'm doing the best that I can.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.965
It's only
a one-year assignment.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.368
Trust me,
the alternative was worse.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.069
Do me a favor and lose
my contact info.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.771
I don't know
what happened to you,

to know you anymore.

Yeah?

Karlina Ordenko is dead.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.791
I believe a man named
Grigory Krukov

39:19.891 --> 39:21.427
gave the order
to have her killed.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.662
He's a high-ranking member
of the FSB.

39:23.762 --> 39:25.664
His diplomatic cover is that
of a senior delegate

39:25.764 --> 39:27.433
of the Russian
Ministry of Trade,

39:27.533 --> 39:29.601
who are directly connected
to Anhur Dynamics.

an employee of Anhur.

39:34.239 --> 39:36.808
All roads lead back
to Anhur Dynamics.

39:36.908 --> 39:42.147
*

39:42.247 --> 39:43.882
I need you here.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.551
It's time to end this.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.853
Please, I can't do this
without you.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.755
[knocking]
Come in.

39:54.593 --> 39:55.727
What's up?

39:55.827 --> 39:57.496
I need a favor.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.968
I need you to suspend me.

40:03.068 --> 40:04.470
Suspend you?

40:04.570 --> 40:05.837
What the hell
are you talking about?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.739
I need you to trust me on this.

40:09.741 --> 40:16.748

[dialing]

40:25.757 --> 40:28.026
[line ringing]

40:28.126 --> 40:30.428
WOMAN: Good afternoon.
Anhur Dynamics.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.630
How may I direct your call?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.632
I want to speak
with Lon Scott.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.667
Tell him it's Bob Lee Swagger.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.973
[phone rings]

40:42.073 --> 40:43.208
Yes?

40:43.308 --> 40:45.143
When you set bait,

40:45.243 --> 40:47.546
it's important you clear
your own smell.

40:47.646 --> 40:52.217
Otherwise even a starving
animal will know it's a trap.

40:52.317 --> 40:55.687
And what will
the starving animal do then?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.556
You're about to find out.

40:57.656 --> 41:00.626
[intense music]
