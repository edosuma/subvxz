02:56.955 --> 02:58.255
Wow!

03:01.006 --> 03:03.515
It is not gold,
but it's deserved.

03:08.243 --> 03:10.146
This left his father
so happy.

03:14.475 --> 03:17.178
The teacher
now he is lieutenant.

03:20.838 --> 03:23.126
We are all heroes, there.

03:25.269 --> 03:27.606
If we had not prevented them,
would be the end.

03:30.101 --> 03:31.551
I'm very proud
from you.

03:33.229 --> 03:34.529
And the others.

03:35.085 --> 03:37.456
- We'll get revenge.
- Yes, we will get revenge.

MUNICIPAL SCHOOL

03:45.452 --> 03:47.271
Good morning Master.

03:47.272 --> 03:48.776
Good morning children.

03:48.777 --> 03:51.180
"Good morning, Lucie.
- Good morning, FranÃ§ois.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.099
Sit down.

04:00.325 --> 04:03.286
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.

04:04.263 --> 04:06.127
We prepare
a surprise.

04:06.552 --> 04:07.852
Baptiste?

04:09.117 --> 04:10.817
The Germans

04:10.818 --> 04:13.956
Sinister and sickly slings
With his abominable designs

04:13.957 --> 04:16.038
Women kill old men
and children

04:16.039 --> 04:17.829
They make the killers angry.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.166
The Germans

04:19.425 --> 04:21.456
Keep honor as a flag

04:21.457 --> 04:23.476
Respect church and tombs

04:23.699 --> 04:27.168
This does not enter your brains.
They hate what is beautiful.

04:27.169 --> 04:28.848
The Germans

04:28.849 --> 04:30.737
Every french bravo
and sarcastic

04:30.738 --> 04:32.338
Bearing in the spirit
And in the heart

04:32.339 --> 04:35.966
A D'Artagan or a Gavroche,
So it will be a winner

04:35.967 --> 04:37.267
About the Germans.

04:37.674 --> 04:38.974
Thank you, Baptiste.

04:41.901 --> 04:43.201
- I can?
- Of course.

05:29.292 --> 05:30.833
It is hard.

06:05.437 --> 06:07.800
Everyone is proud
Of you here, you know?

06:09.212 --> 06:10.512
Very proud.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.477
IT IS.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.402
Take it all off.

06:28.284 --> 06:29.584
You're beautiful, sister.

06:31.652 --> 06:32.952
Beautiful.

06:54.826 --> 06:56.683
Should enjoy
the absence of Clovis

06:56.684 --> 06:58.192
to modernize the farm.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.172
On the war front
we see things.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.857
Tractors ...

07:06.235 --> 07:08.009
washing machines...

07:08.010 --> 07:09.890
a lot of new things.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.188
To the mistress!

07:13.451 --> 07:15.908
An employer with no employees,
She's not a boss.

07:22.634 --> 07:24.562
After the war
everything will be different.

07:30.675 --> 07:33.766
Then, to their future children
who will know peace.

07:39.842 --> 07:41.361
There will never be children.

07:46.743 --> 07:48.043
I can not.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.870
Does Clovis already know?

07:53.411 --> 07:54.711
Do not.

08:02.517 --> 08:03.922
So, to victory?

08:06.312 --> 08:07.760
Your victory.

08:07.761 --> 08:09.061
Then to victory.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.408
Nobody was prepared.

08:34.140 --> 08:36.149
Not to be believed
in everything you read.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.642
Part up
for a lightning war

08:41.914 --> 08:44.081
and then, for two years,
we live in hell.

08:48.276 --> 08:50.384
In my regiment
There are guys that go crazy.

08:54.107 --> 08:56.557
It will soon
a soldier behind each one

08:56.558 --> 08:57.858
to go there.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.808
If the harvest is good ...

09:05.666 --> 09:07.987
I intend to buy
a harvester.

09:10.256 --> 09:12.370
But it's a little expensive ...

09:13.663 --> 09:15.791
It's expensive, but it's
a good investment.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.449
We will not end anymore
with the back and ...

09:19.832 --> 09:21.428
we will gain time.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.847
The mayor told me
that I can

09:26.848 --> 09:28.498
receive indemnification
of the ministry.

09:28.499 --> 09:30.399
Lent
for another three.

09:32.078 --> 09:33.378
All right, Mom.

09:33.379 --> 09:34.679
It's a good thing.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.353
Need to find someone
to help you.

09:40.354 --> 09:42.946
I should not have sent
the girls though.

09:42.947 --> 09:45.025
Solange was right.
They did not help.

09:45.026 --> 09:48.434
It's a little.
What they were doing was done.

09:48.435 --> 09:50.696
- Half.
It was necessary to redo.

09:50.697 --> 09:53.387
- Yeah, sometimes.
- It was always necessary to redo.

09:53.388 --> 09:55.080
Why do not you ask?
Suzanne?

09:57.009 --> 09:58.309
Her son was called.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.231
Got a lot of work.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.669
"Can not you stay at the Paridier?"
- No!

10:05.627 --> 10:06.927
Each one in his.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.534
Need to find someone

10:11.535 --> 10:13.135
to help you
before harvest.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.780
You do not really want to
May I take you?

10:45.120 --> 10:48.202
No, I want to walk.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.566
Good trip!

11:20.630 --> 11:22.330
Be strong!

12:01.637 --> 12:02.937
Let's go!

12:03.830 --> 12:05.130
Let's go!

12:24.104 --> 12:26.110
Hang on.

12:26.452 --> 12:27.758
Not like this.
Place...

12:28.946 --> 12:30.354
Come on.
More here.

12:35.614 --> 12:36.914
Come on.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.436
How much should I?

13:45.108 --> 13:48.263
The situation...
All this harvest ...

13:48.264 --> 13:49.907
I have nobody,

13:49.908 --> 13:51.916
not even
a day job to offer.

13:52.070 --> 13:54.046
You came too late.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.954
I did not have time.

13:59.462 --> 14:01.002
Are they all already leased?

14:06.754 --> 14:09.476
There would be a young servant
of our house.

14:09.477 --> 14:11.771
She is robust honest

14:11.772 --> 14:13.626
and especially,
a perfect worker.

14:13.627 --> 14:15.209
You'll be free soon.

14:15.711 --> 14:17.426
But if you want to find it,

14:17.427 --> 14:18.727
you need to go to Bellac.

14:20.003 --> 14:21.303
It's too far!

14:26.351 --> 14:27.739
I'll trust you.

14:28.553 --> 14:31.053
Say that I will stay with her
until the end of the harvest.

14:31.054 --> 14:32.917
You will not be disappointed.

14:33.265 --> 14:35.617
Francine Riant
only 20 years old,

14:35.618 --> 14:38.283
but is suitable
to heavy work

14:38.284 --> 14:40.239
as well as
to precision work.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.540
I thank you.

14:42.618 --> 14:44.918
As soon as you can,
I'll wait there at home.

14:44.919 --> 14:46.219
Very well.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.789
So I'm going to prepare the contract.

14:50.964 --> 14:52.372
<i> "My dear George." </ i></i>

14:52.904 --> 14:56.361
<i> How painful for a mother
imagine the suffering of the child. </ i></i>

14:57.077 --> 14:58.989
<i> I do not read the newspaper anymore. </ i></i>

14:58.990 --> 15:02.177
<i> All these fights frighten me
and I feel pain imagining you there. </ i></i>

15:02.367 --> 15:04.942
<i> So far from the country
that you love so much. </ i></i>

15:05.494 --> 15:08.079
<i> Constant got his license,
he is fine. </ i></i>

15:08.080 --> 15:09.943
<i> Now he's a lieutenant. </ i></i>

15:10.544 --> 15:13.715
<i> Here it rained too much and wheat
grew erratically. </ i></i>

15:14.475 --> 15:16.053
<i> Tell me what you miss. </ i></i>

15:16.054 --> 15:18.226
<i> I will send you an order
very fast. </ i></i>

15:18.227 --> 15:20.252
<i> Your mother,
who thinks a lot about you. "</ i></i>

16:00.339 --> 16:01.639
Stopped there.

16:06.421 --> 16:08.242
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:57.628 --> 17:58.928
Mrs. Hortense?

18:04.976 --> 18:06.276
I'm Francine.

18:07.984 --> 18:11.053
I was waiting for you.
I was very happy.

18:12.722 --> 18:14.022
Let's go.

18:14.874 --> 18:16.174
Come on.

18:20.964 --> 18:22.382
Do you know how to lead the herd?

18:22.922 --> 18:24.222
Yes.

18:24.988 --> 18:26.788
I already did that
in the old bosses.

18:26.789 --> 18:28.376
I'm not afraid.

18:29.848 --> 18:31.776
How was there?

18:33.076 --> 18:34.376
Very well.

18:35.878 --> 18:38.041
Before you face
the work in the plantation,

18:38.042 --> 18:40.895
will help Solange
at home work

18:40.896 --> 18:42.562
and in the garden.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.176
You will receive 40 francs,
as combined,

18:46.177 --> 18:47.477
At the end of the month.

18:48.724 --> 18:52.056
You will have Sundays free,
except during harvesting.

18:55.908 --> 18:58.818
Get your things.
Solange will accompany you.

19:00.023 --> 19:01.573
Come on,
I'll show you the room.

19:03.905 --> 19:05.786
She seems to be gentle.
It's lovely...

19:05.787 --> 19:07.087
So...

19:07.450 --> 19:08.750
We'll see.

19:57.701 --> 19:59.001
Let's go!

20:45.373 --> 20:46.719
Do not cut your fingers!

20:52.973 --> 20:54.273
One or two?

20:54.274 --> 20:55.611
Yes, add one more.

20:58.099 --> 20:59.887
That should be enough.

21:01.037 --> 21:03.629
Let's mix
with the wine.

21:12.025 --> 21:13.792
The barrel is at the end.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.528
"Do you know what barrel is?"
- No.

21:19.572 --> 21:21.616
It's such a small barrel.

21:22.628 --> 21:23.928
A little bit.

21:24.612 --> 21:25.912
A kite.

21:36.068 --> 21:37.368
Put one more.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.480
- There.
- Is that enough?

21:51.481 --> 21:52.781
Yes.

21:53.418 --> 21:55.407
We will put more,
if necessary.

21:55.576 --> 21:57.222
Let's try
after.

22:03.666 --> 22:05.067
Bread and good wine.

22:05.656 --> 22:07.344
Here it is,
is not complicated.

22:07.854 --> 22:10.602
It does not have to be a genius.
to do this.

22:13.447 --> 22:14.747
Thank you, Hortense.

22:21.936 --> 22:23.453
Come on!

22:25.922 --> 22:27.834
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

22:28.621 --> 22:31.108
"My name is Marguerite.
- Francine.

22:44.454 --> 22:50.454
GEORGES SANDRAIL
90th INFANTRY REGIMENT

22:52.183 --> 22:57.035
5th COMPANY
POSTAL SECTOR 90

26:45.725 --> 26:47.025
He returned!

26:47.026 --> 26:48.617
It's Clovis!

26:58.998 --> 27:00.298
And the Germans ...?

27:02.248 --> 27:03.548
Who are the Germans?

27:03.549 --> 27:05.810
Are they monsters, bloody?

27:08.729 --> 27:10.029
For they are not.

27:12.515 --> 27:14.438
The Germans
they are people like us.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.003
They are workers.

27:19.530 --> 27:22.287
They are primary teachers,
like Constant.

27:23.359 --> 27:24.839
Farmers,

27:25.234 --> 27:26.534
like us.

27:35.782 --> 27:37.251
I do not expect anything else.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.732
One day, we move forward ...

27:41.028 --> 27:42.328
ten meters.

27:46.339 --> 27:48.194
And ten meters,
the next day,

27:50.791 --> 27:52.091
we lose...

27:56.817 --> 27:58.117
We can not say anything.

28:12.238 --> 28:13.538
Let's go!

28:14.868 --> 28:16.168
- Let's go!
- Let's go...

28:20.712 --> 28:22.283
<i> - Did you see Clovis?
- Yes. </ I></i>

28:22.284 --> 28:24.048
<i> Exaggerated drinking. </ i></i>

28:24.291 --> 28:26.591
<i> It's like that on the front lines,
to continue ... </ i></i>

28:27.775 --> 28:29.075
<i> You have to laugh. </ i></i>

28:30.581 --> 28:31.906
Do you think you'll see?

28:33.707 --> 28:35.007
A little.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.266
But not much.

28:38.753 --> 28:41.334
"Can you leave me tonight?"
- Of course.

28:52.278 --> 28:54.507
You learned how to sew
in the orphanage?

28:55.434 --> 28:56.734
Was.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.262
Read and write as well.

29:00.524 --> 29:02.853
I have a certificate of studies,
You know?

29:04.855 --> 29:06.662
Is that you,
are your studies difficult?

29:08.366 --> 29:11.005
It's the accounting
of the agricultural industries.

29:11.404 --> 29:13.064
It is restricted,
but when I leave

29:13.065 --> 29:15.049
I can help my father.
in the farm.

29:15.772 --> 29:17.501
I want him to feel
proud of me.

29:20.095 --> 29:21.395
He scared me at dinner.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.758
I do not recognize him anymore.

29:29.493 --> 29:31.583
I'm afraid they're coming back.

29:32.087 --> 29:34.482
Calm down,
Your father will be brave.

29:36.321 --> 29:38.994
When the war is over,
it will be...

29:40.440 --> 29:42.137
It will be much better
for you guys.

29:47.657 --> 29:50.693
And maybe I can help
Georges on the farm too.

29:50.694 --> 29:52.883
He will have a license soon.

29:52.884 --> 29:55.226
Yeah, but I'll just stay.
3 days to harvest

29:55.227 --> 29:56.527
and I'm going back to boarding school.

29:57.374 --> 29:59.245
You have luck:
at least you will see it.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.850
I hired you
for harvesting,

32:54.458 --> 32:55.808
but I'm happy
with you.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.244
You work well.

32:59.172 --> 33:00.622
So, if you want,
could

33:00.680 --> 33:02.605
extend
your contract for the year.

33:06.863 --> 33:09.277
Yes, thank you.

33:10.111 --> 33:12.234
- Thank you, Mrs. Hortense.

It's ok.

34:50.426 --> 34:51.726
Let's go.

36:30.600 --> 36:31.900
Thank you.

36:44.734 --> 36:47.086
Some news from Clovis,
after the permission?

36:47.087 --> 36:48.387
Yes.

36:48.734 --> 36:50.754
We receive orders,
mainly.

36:50.755 --> 36:52.975
He thinks
that you can run a farm

36:52.976 --> 36:54.376
from the front line.

37:01.382 --> 37:03.044
He trusts us ...

37:07.154 --> 37:09.143
And you, Mom,
Are you less exhausted?

37:10.886 --> 37:13.053
With the help of the girl,
it's better.

37:13.917 --> 37:15.357
She's a good worker.

37:16.355 --> 37:18.116
It's worth two men.

Are you Francine?

38:03.458 --> 38:04.758
Georges.

38:06.161 --> 38:08.132
Are you the maid?
most effective in the country?

38:08.133 --> 38:09.433
I'm doing the best I can.

38:15.656 --> 38:17.656
I must return to the Paridier,
Mr. Georges.

38:17.657 --> 38:18.957
"Sir," no.

38:19.547 --> 38:20.847
Georges.

38:26.220 --> 38:27.520
Am I intimidating you?

38:31.282 --> 38:32.582
Do not.

38:34.990 --> 38:36.931
I'm going back to Paridier,
Mr. Georges.

38:38.207 --> 38:40.892
- See you, Henri.
"See you tomorrow, Francine."

39:12.133 --> 39:13.996
Come on!
Come on. </ I>

39:30.722 --> 39:32.969
Not very well maintained
in the Paridier.

39:33.488 --> 39:34.788
I know my mother.

39:37.210 --> 39:38.864
Your mother worries.

39:39.861 --> 39:41.161
I understand you.

39:44.454 --> 39:45.754
And Solange?

39:46.873 --> 39:48.259
She is so elegant.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.506
She's different
of the other peasants.

39:52.943 --> 39:54.444
You have not seen anything yet.

40:02.254 --> 40:04.898
With all this, I did not even have time
to take her to the forest.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.204
The trees are well
more beautiful than here.

40:13.204 --> 40:14.627
And beyond that,
has a treasure.

40:15.356 --> 40:16.656
A treasure?

40:16.657 --> 40:18.024
What is?

40:18.480 --> 40:19.780
I will not tell you now.

40:21.306 --> 40:22.606
It's a surprise.

40:25.176 --> 40:26.476
Would you come?

40:27.542 --> 40:30.018
Of course.
With Marguerite.

40:35.024 --> 40:37.716
I really like Marguerite,
but it's like a little sister.

40:37.717 --> 40:39.335
Is a child
that I saw grow.

40:49.631 --> 40:51.222
I'm leaving tomorrow.

40:53.270 --> 40:54.806
Maybe I'll come back ...

40:56.102 --> 40:57.402
Will return.

41:00.263 --> 41:02.111
But maybe
do not be here anymore

41:03.949 --> 41:05.679
It does not depend on me alone.

41:09.271 --> 41:11.391
We need you,
we cherish it.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.518
No one thinks of
I'll send you away.

41:15.216 --> 41:16.788
So I'll stay.

41:18.634 --> 41:19.934
Will you write to me?

42:17.247 --> 42:19.624
Let's get the mare.
and a cow.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.442
It will be the last of the year.

42:22.465 --> 42:25.666
I await acceptance from the ministry
and you will be on the fifth.

45:04.973 --> 45:07.103
Can not be with air,
remove the excess.

45:09.355 --> 45:12.105
If you feel cold at night,
ask for another Solange duvet.

45:13.403 --> 45:15.292
Thanks. For a while,
it's all right.

45:42.080 --> 45:45.326

We'll be with you, daughter.

in Germany.

46:47.671 --> 46:49.268
You will find
your husband.

46:50.316 --> 46:52.221
He was not dishonored.

46:52.556 --> 46:53.856
And more...

46:54.101 --> 46:55.966
Look on the bright side:

46:56.325 --> 46:58.357
he does not take the risk
of being killed.

47:02.692 --> 47:03.992
Let's go.

47:05.852 --> 47:07.822
I can not understand
where is he.

It was Constant.

Come.

died of childbirth.

53:52.608 --> 53:54.528
Your mother must have been beautiful.

53:58.256 --> 53:59.556
Do not know.

54:05.882 --> 54:07.608
I've never seen photos.

54:11.925 --> 54:14.656
I'll never know the faces.

54:18.376 --> 54:20.853

I imagine them.

54:35.316 --> 54:37.336

during His glorious stay

55:23.918 --> 55:27.133
do not forget the sorrows
of our land.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.037
Drive
a look of kindness

55:30.038 --> 55:32.724
for those who are
suffering,

55:32.725 --> 55:34.025
to those who fight,

55:34.438 --> 55:38.318
and that do not stop wetting
the lips in the bitterness of life

55:38.976 --> 55:41.298
and have pity
of those who sowed

55:41.299 --> 55:43.766
and which were separated.

55:44.070 --> 55:47.064
Have mercy

55:49.697 --> 55:52.382

55:52.797 --> 55:55.565
Have mercy

55:59.409 --> 56:01.089

Maybe yes.

you can use it.

how much?

It's sad to leave,
it is?

01:05:43.496 --> 01:05:45.437
You have no one

01:05:46.228 --> 01:05:47.628
Could not
have found another?

01:05:49.587 --> 01:05:51.987
Why did not you tell me?
What did he write you?

01:05:53.697 --> 01:05:55.328
He wants to know
from the farm.

01:05:55.329 --> 01:05:56.629
Do not.

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:57.930
He loves you.

01:06:01.062 --> 01:06:02.632
Get out of my room.

01:06:02.998 --> 01:06:04.298
Skirt.

01:06:19.785 --> 01:06:21.085
What he is doing?

01:06:36.428 --> 01:06:38.852
War spoils men,
Marguerite.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.047
You are too young
for this.

01:06:48.612 --> 01:06:51.176
Georges ...
He changed.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:58.106
And my Clovis also,
I know.

01:07:01.422 --> 01:07:02.722
Come on!

01:07:05.026 --> 01:07:06.326
Come on.

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:09.218
Come on!

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.312
Come on, go!
Come on.

01:08:48.844 --> 01:08:51.301
It's like a nightmare.

01:08:51.863 --> 01:08:53.893
I hope his return
every day.

01:08:56.725 --> 01:08:58.026
Every day.

01:09:00.398 --> 01:09:02.064
Every day.

01:09:13.423 --> 01:09:14.723
And Clovis?

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.488
He's with the Germans.

01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.140
Not being
ill-treated,

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:20.441
for what he wrote.

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:25.343
That's nice.

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.898
Good morning, Mr. George.

01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:36.077
Leave us, Francine,
we are sad

01:12:36.857 --> 01:12:38.593
My brother, Georges.

01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:40.499
Much pleasure.

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.250
Came to buy
butter and vegetables.

01:12:42.251 --> 01:12:43.749
Good French vegetables.

01:12:50.172 --> 01:12:52.266
And then they liked it
from France?

01:12:52.606 --> 01:12:53.906
Much.

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:55.787
And people

01:12:57.482 --> 01:12:58.782
They are very kind.

01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:02.606
And the women...

01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:04.615
Very beautiful.

01:13:04.616 --> 01:13:06.395
Exact.
Yes.

01:13:07.123 --> 01:13:09.340
I said, very beautiful.

01:13:12.825 --> 01:13:14.751
- What are you doing here?
- What?

01:13:14.752 --> 01:13:17.497
What are you waiting for?
Why are not you fighting anymore?

01:13:17.498 --> 01:13:20.505
- What...?
"In the mud, like my brother?"

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.676
Someone has to explain.

01:13:24.238 --> 01:13:26.238
- Answer!
- Georges.

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:28.849
- What you mean?
- You understand?

01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:30.487
Stop.

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:32.835
They also
are far from home.

01:13:50.585 --> 01:13:53.910
Never said
of the Americans who come here.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:58.015
I thought that Solange
I had written to you.

01:14:00.133 --> 01:14:01.433
They are good customers.

01:14:02.210 --> 01:14:03.937
They buy a lot.

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:05.519
Good customers?

01:14:06.335 --> 01:14:07.885
Some thieves, yes.

01:14:07.886 --> 01:14:10.309
And they think that they can
with the women here.

01:14:14.502 --> 01:14:16.460
I understand that you get angry,

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:19.270
but it is unfair.

01:14:19.271 --> 01:14:21.571
They are waiting for the order
to go to combat.

01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.860
Sunday I'll take you
in my forest.

01:14:34.882 --> 01:14:36.182
You will come?

01:14:39.329 --> 01:14:40.629
I will.

01:14:41.664 --> 01:14:43.312
I come to pick you up
by noon.

01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:44.759
On the Calvary.

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:49.530
Yes.

01:15:13.586 --> 01:15:15.987
- Good morning, Francine.
- Good Morning.

01:15:19.746 --> 01:15:21.446
Let's go.

01:15:25.778 --> 01:15:27.860
- Are you well installed?
- I am.

01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:30.967
You can open it.

01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:36.181
My God!

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.651
Marguerite!

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.739
I do not need a hypocrite
pick me up.

01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:07.295
What I did to deserve
So much anger?

01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:15.207
You wrote to Francine.

01:21:18.486 --> 01:21:19.786
She is the one you love.

01:21:20.726 --> 01:21:22.026
Not me.

01:21:25.286 --> 01:21:27.460
Of course I love you.

01:21:28.064 --> 01:21:30.364
I know you
since his eleven years.

01:21:31.508 --> 01:21:33.168
It's my little sister.

01:21:35.448 --> 01:21:36.748
You are my sun.

01:21:40.139 --> 01:21:41.439
I'm a woman now.

01:21:43.038 --> 01:21:44.338
Yes.

01:21:45.561 --> 01:21:47.866
In fact, it is becoming
a beautiful woman.

01:21:49.976 --> 01:21:53.364
We put the fruit here,
in that compartment.

01:21:53.365 --> 01:21:54.665
They boil,

01:21:55.985 --> 01:21:58.827
alcohol is a vapor,

01:21:58.828 --> 01:22:01.356
He goes through the serpentine
and cools.

01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:03.489
I like this guy.

01:22:05.429 --> 01:22:07.395
- And here it falls.
- Right.

01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:10.597
- And we serve. And we drink.
- We drink.

01:22:10.598 --> 01:22:11.898
- IT IS!
- We drank.

01:22:11.899 --> 01:22:13.484
We like to drink.

01:22:14.567 --> 01:22:18.408
<i> Everyone likes someone
who likes you </ i></i>

01:22:22.641 --> 01:22:24.116
- On here!
- Thank you.

01:22:24.616 --> 01:22:26.166
- Thank you.
- You too.

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:28.068
- Right?
- You too.

01:22:29.384 --> 01:22:30.684
Right.

01:22:30.685 --> 01:22:32.704
- And let's go.
- Right. Let's go.

01:22:32.705 --> 01:22:34.420
Thank you very much.

01:22:34.421 --> 01:22:36.780
- Thank you!
- Good trip. Good luck.

01:22:36.781 --> 01:22:39.632
- Thank you!
- Good trip.

01:22:39.633 --> 01:22:40.933
All right, let's go!

01:22:41.301 --> 01:22:42.601
Go!

01:23:27.175 --> 01:23:28.475
Georges!

01:23:28.476 --> 01:23:30.359
Go show them.
To the Americans.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.870
<i> - No, damn it!
"What's the matter with you?"</i>

01:23:33.283 --> 01:23:34.683
- Are you having a good time?
- It is?

01:23:37.326 --> 01:23:38.626
Like this.

01:23:38.792 --> 01:23:40.686
Now...
Very straight.

01:23:45.497 --> 01:23:46.797
One at a time.

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:50.881
One at a time, come on.

01:23:52.302 --> 01:23:53.602
You too.

01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:57.840
- That, very well.
- Right. Thank you.

01:24:08.312 --> 01:24:10.059
- We have a problem.
- What?

01:26:47.817 --> 01:26:50.062
Francine,
Do you know where Solange is?

01:26:51.216 --> 01:26:52.812
No, I do not know.

01:27:59.273 --> 01:28:00.913
Increased
your income.

01:28:01.263 --> 01:28:02.563
It's rare at the moment.

01:28:03.147 --> 01:28:04.967
We found solutions.

01:28:07.028 --> 01:28:08.455
Careful, Hortense.

01:28:08.941 --> 01:28:10.241
It will create envy.

01:28:10.961 --> 01:28:13.411
I defend the interests
of my family as I can.

01:28:13.704 --> 01:28:15.704
They're talking
of his daughter.

01:28:26.092 --> 01:28:28.098
They talk a lot
around.

01:28:57.902 --> 01:28:59.652
Let's not lie.

01:28:59.653 --> 01:29:01.413
Maybe I will not be back.

01:29:02.719 --> 01:29:04.019
Like Constant.

01:29:06.837 --> 01:29:08.137
So...

01:29:09.439 --> 01:29:10.739
I wanted to tell you ...

01:29:14.677 --> 01:29:15.977
Marguerite ...

01:29:17.472 --> 01:29:18.772
Marguerite ...

01:29:21.657 --> 01:29:23.799
We are proud of you.

01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.175
Sister...

01:29:29.683 --> 01:29:31.987
You will give us
beautiful children.

01:29:39.367 --> 01:29:40.667
Mom...

01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:47.717
You are a magnificent woman.

01:29:53.588 --> 01:29:54.888
Love you.

01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:22.288
My God...

01:30:23.233 --> 01:30:25.156
Take good care of my love,

01:30:25.651 --> 01:30:27.851
keep him from being killed,
nor injured.

01:31:29.933 --> 01:31:31.233
Francine.

01:31:31.928 --> 01:31:33.923
Some drink left
for Americans?

01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:36.919
I think so.
I'll check.

01:31:53.126 --> 01:31:54.426
Very well.

01:31:57.198 --> 01:31:59.716
Five, ten and ten ...
Here it is.

01:32:01.178 --> 01:32:03.938
It's two.

01:32:11.087 --> 01:32:12.387
What do you want?

01:33:07.575 --> 01:33:09.489
Francine works well,
but...

01:33:10.425 --> 01:33:11.725
is a woman of nothing.

01:33:13.317 --> 01:33:15.442
She goes out with the foreigners.

01:33:28.425 --> 01:33:30.011
Did you know that?

01:33:32.438 --> 01:33:34.655
Did you know that your servant
Was it any?

01:33:36.909 --> 01:33:39.859
With women of this species,
Expect anything.

01:33:41.588 --> 01:33:43.348
They have no sense.

01:33:50.894 --> 01:33:52.194
Send her away.

01:35:13.488 --> 01:35:14.788
My daughter,

01:35:15.064 --> 01:35:17.825
since today,
we do not need you anymore

01:35:24.358 --> 01:35:25.658
But what have I done?

01:35:27.428 --> 01:35:29.070
There are too many rumors
in the Paridier.

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:31.756
About Paridier
and Americans.

01:35:31.757 --> 01:35:33.830
There is no smoke without fire.

01:35:40.067 --> 01:35:41.367
Mother Hortense,

01:35:44.864 --> 01:35:46.627
Mother Hortense, it's not me.

01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.749
You know
that it's not me.

01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:50.701
I did nothing.

01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:53.246
I know.

01:35:55.955 --> 01:35:58.305
But this needs to stop.
before the return of Clovis.

01:35:59.139 --> 01:36:00.439
Clovis?

01:36:03.645 --> 01:36:05.680
But Clovis
It has nothing to do, I ...

01:36:07.283 --> 01:36:09.465
It's been two years
I work here.

01:36:12.707 --> 01:36:14.628
I did everything right, Hortense.

01:36:16.442 --> 01:36:19.051
and you esteem me,
I know.

01:36:20.045 --> 01:36:21.914
I need to protect
my family.

01:36:26.509 --> 01:36:28.304
And I'm not family.

01:36:37.365 --> 01:36:38.665
It's unfair.

01:36:42.886 --> 01:36:45.325
It is unfair, Hortense,
and you know.

01:36:52.914 --> 01:36:54.214
I do everything here.

01:36:57.315 --> 01:36:58.615
I do everything.

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:02.348
I'll make a letter
of recommendation

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:04.048
and I will pay 2 months
of bonus.

01:37:05.247 --> 01:37:07.181
I do not want.

01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:09.991
I do not really want to.

01:37:16.195 --> 01:37:18.091
You're a monster.

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:31.504
Go!

01:39:05.235 --> 01:39:06.535
You embarrass me.

01:39:07.745 --> 01:39:10.745
Her husband imprisoned in Germany
and you become a fucking American.

01:39:11.315 --> 01:39:13.659
I will not be a whore,
They did not pay me.

01:39:13.660 --> 01:39:15.153
How dare you
tell me this

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:16.882
Is that you?

01:39:16.883 --> 01:39:19.899
Dared to send Francine away.
Who helped us so much?

01:39:20.225 --> 01:39:21.975
All this
to save your little project

01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:23.643
of nuptials
of Marguerite and George?

01:39:23.644 --> 01:39:24.944
I threw it away
because...

01:39:24.945 --> 01:39:27.195
everybody talks
of Americans in the Paridier.

01:39:27.196 --> 01:39:29.046
I sent it to you
to save your honor

01:39:29.047 --> 01:39:30.504
and that of her husband.

01:39:30.505 --> 01:39:31.805
But I did not ask for anything.

01:39:32.052 --> 01:39:33.352
And I did not do anything.

01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:35.312
- But I saw.
- Oh yes? Saw?

01:39:35.313 --> 01:39:37.285
"Yes, I saw you with him."
- What did you see?

01:39:37.747 --> 01:39:39.075
What did you see?

01:39:43.008 --> 01:39:44.369
Yes, I am a young woman.

01:39:44.553 --> 01:39:46.015
Yes, I do.

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:48.078
Yes it is,
I found it very beautiful.

01:39:49.182 --> 01:39:50.482
And you want to know the truth?

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:54.781
He kissed me.
I kissed him.

01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:57.333
He stroked me
the breasts.

01:39:57.756 --> 01:39:59.531
Yes, I felt pleasure.

01:39:59.532 --> 01:40:00.832
Much pleasure.

01:40:02.077 --> 01:40:03.863
And then I thought of Clovis.

01:40:05.143 --> 01:40:07.371
And we get dressed again,
only that.

01:40:07.372 --> 01:40:08.843
Nothing happened.

01:40:08.844 --> 01:40:10.144
Anything!

01:40:11.093 --> 01:40:12.393
Anything.

01:40:44.457 --> 01:40:46.524
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

01:40:46.986 --> 01:40:48.286
I'm Francine.

01:40:50.806 --> 01:40:52.106
Mom.

01:40:52.424 --> 01:40:53.871
Mom,
she arrived.

01:40:59.612 --> 01:41:00.912
- Good Morning.
- Good Morning.

01:41:00.913 --> 01:41:02.213
In between.

01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:15.937
You can by the small
up there.

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:30.743
Excuse me.

01:42:33.271 --> 01:42:35.283
I do not know what I have
recent times.

01:42:35.284 --> 01:42:36.584
I feel sick.

01:42:37.509 --> 01:42:39.761
I had the same thing
with Jeanne at the beginning.

01:42:42.339 --> 01:42:43.639
As well?

01:42:45.465 --> 01:42:48.498
Do not wonder, daughter.
You are pregnant.

01:42:58.464 --> 01:42:59.804
Do not make that face.

01:43:00.562 --> 01:43:01.862
Maybe it's good.

01:43:02.471 --> 01:43:05.145
Winter is coming.
There are fewer things to do.

01:43:06.683 --> 01:43:08.866
No, I'm not pregnant.

01:43:16.793 --> 01:43:18.121
And how will I do it?

01:43:18.799 --> 01:43:20.099
Like everyone, now ...

01:43:29.889 --> 01:43:32.080
<i> Come, my angel </ i></i>

01:43:32.321 --> 01:43:35.348
<i> My beloved little angel </ i></i>

01:43:35.366 --> 01:43:37.844
<i> Come with me to a pure sky </ i></i>

01:43:37.845 --> 01:43:41.197
<i> Sing a sweet chorus </ i></i>

01:43:45.700 --> 01:43:48.324
<i> Come, my angel, </ i></i>

01:43:48.769 --> 01:43:51.912
<i> My beloved and beautiful angel </ i></i>

01:43:52.724 --> 01:43:56.298
<i> Dad works
for your love </ i></i>

01:43:56.299 --> 01:43:59.058
<i> And just think of us. </ i></i>

01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:08.281
Is tired?

01:44:20.195 --> 01:44:21.962
"They took the two sisters

01:44:21.963 --> 01:44:25.399
that did everything possible
to thrust at his feet.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:27.617
But they could not.

01:44:28.216 --> 01:44:33.192
Cinderella, who was looking
and recognized them, laughing ... "

01:44:33.193 --> 01:44:36.724
You will stay here
long time?

01:44:38.703 --> 01:44:40.671
While his mother
want me.

01:44:46.742 --> 01:44:48.906
"They want me to see
if it does not fit on my foot? "

01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:42.489
<i> "Until you lose sight of it, </ i></i>

01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:44.491

Monette, I'm distressed.

01:47:22.176 --> 01:47:23.707
Since I arrived here,

01:47:23.977 --> 01:47:25.734
My letters come back.

01:47:26.921 --> 01:47:28.793
Maybe it happened.
something.

01:47:30.119 --> 01:47:31.419
No, you would know.

01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:34.125
Here, you know everything.

01:47:47.552 --> 01:47:49.252
Maybe he's dead?

01:47:49.655 --> 01:47:51.070
No, settle down.

01:47:55.659 --> 01:47:57.226
But I do not understand.

01:47:58.322 --> 01:47:59.862
He knows I love him.

01:48:00.671 --> 01:48:01.971
I wrote him.

01:48:04.866 --> 01:48:07.456
He can not believe
that I betrayed him.

01:48:10.135 --> 01:48:12.890
When this cursed war
finish, you will see.

01:48:15.896 --> 01:48:18.383
And becoming a parent
It changes a man.

01:48:26.128 --> 01:48:27.428
Come on, eat some.

01:49:11.514 --> 01:49:13.214
Make a ball.

01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:15.070
Nice ball, Jeanne.

01:49:15.605 --> 01:49:17.206
Everything Mom knows.

01:49:17.207 --> 01:49:19.944
Too tight to the end.

01:49:27.648 --> 01:49:29.999
- Like this?
- Ah yes.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:31.300
In between.

01:49:34.682 --> 01:49:35.982
Good Morning.

01:49:47.992 --> 01:49:50.353
Come on Jeanne, let's get out.

01:50:02.704 --> 01:50:04.004
It's your husband.

01:50:16.064 --> 01:50:17.764
I want to stay with Mom.

01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:19.844
No, Jeanne,
Let's go for a walk.

01:50:21.027 --> 01:50:22.327
Let's go for a walk.

01:50:27.684 --> 01:50:28.984
Come here.

01:50:28.985 --> 01:50:30.285
Come on, Jeanne.

01:53:04.614 --> 01:53:07.140
Mr. GuÃ©rard, your bread
It's ready, see you tomorrow.

01:53:07.141 --> 01:53:08.541
See you tomorrow.
Thank you, Marthe.

01:53:34.404 --> 01:53:35.832
He's back in the war.

01:53:38.457 --> 01:53:40.707
and refused to respond
my letters.

01:53:40.708 --> 01:53:43.216
This boy, of course,
did like the others.

01:53:44.764 --> 01:53:48.132
He stopped seeing you
as soon as I heard about your condition.

01:53:49.074 --> 01:53:50.374
He does not know anything.

01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:54.062
Nobody knows anything,
I did not tell.

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.060
But Francine,

01:53:58.044 --> 01:54:01.074
if he knew, his conduct
maybe it was another.

01:54:02.842 --> 01:54:04.361
I ask you to tell,

01:54:04.362 --> 01:54:07.282
if not for you,
do it for the baby.

01:54:09.666 --> 01:54:12.525
Do you want to abandon him?

01:54:14.092 --> 01:54:15.392
Never.

01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.660
I have money.

01:54:20.668 --> 01:54:21.984
I have the savings.

01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:24.710
I will work.

01:54:26.795 --> 01:54:28.599
I'll deprive myself of him.

01:54:31.555 --> 01:54:33.079
He'll have my last name.

01:54:35.594 --> 01:54:36.894
And he will defend me.

01:54:39.502 --> 01:54:40.802
Yes.

01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:43.650
He will defend me.

01:54:54.302 --> 01:54:56.490
<i> "I hesitated a lot of time

Goodbye, Benjamin.

Victor!

01:57:48.034 --> 01:57:49.334
You are hurt?

01:57:50.685 --> 01:57:51.985
I had a wound.

02:00:23.107 --> 02:00:24.707
Make us,
Godfather and godmother,

02:00:27.005 --> 02:00:28.905
authentic witnesses
of God's love.

IN MEMORY OF CONSTANT SANDRAIL
DEAD BY FRANCE

02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:35.114
<i> Teach us to live
what we teach. </ i></i>

02:00:36.292 --> 02:00:38.891
<i> Teaching that
in which we believe </ i></i>

02:00:39.922 --> 02:00:43.169
<i> and to believe in that
which we have discovered from You, </ i></i>

02:00:43.891 --> 02:00:45.191
<i> in our heart </ i></i>

02:00:46.304 --> 02:00:47.959
<i> and in the gospel. </ i></i>

02:00:48.219 --> 02:00:49.519
Good morning, Hortense.

02:01:00.830 --> 02:01:03.831
Henry, I baptize you.

02:01:03.832 --> 02:01:09.641
in the name of the Father, the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

02:01:53.919 --> 02:01:55.219
Until tonight.

02:01:55.979 --> 02:01:57.279
Come on.

02:04:36.876 --> 02:04:38.883
I bought it for a good price.

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:41.564
Americans found him
behind the lines.

02:05:49.249 --> 02:05:50.549
How nice!

02:05:54.610 --> 02:05:56.910
Constant was never interested
by these lands.

02:05:56.911 --> 02:05:59.190
- He was a teacher.
- What was he doing?

02:05:59.882 --> 02:06:01.182
He passed her.

02:06:02.728 --> 02:06:04.510
And sometimes
your classes here.

02:06:06.016 --> 02:06:07.495
My father is right.

02:06:07.809 --> 02:06:10.381
Solange invested
a harvester and a tractor.

02:06:10.802 --> 02:06:13.018
It would be worth
not monetize them.

02:06:13.567 --> 02:06:15.567
We can not let
the abandoned forests

02:06:15.568 --> 02:06:16.868
and the lands to God shall give.

02:06:18.258 --> 02:06:20.621
We thought it would be good
that my father and Solange

02:06:20.622 --> 02:06:22.445
grow back
the lands

02:06:24.903 --> 02:06:26.809
and you would be left with the woods.

02:06:27.426 --> 02:06:28.726
Did you think?

02:06:29.587 --> 02:06:31.837
And why would not it be me?
that would return to cultivate

02:06:31.838 --> 02:06:33.388
with Clovis
taking care of the forests?

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.680
The harvester was my mother.
who paid

02:06:35.681 --> 02:06:37.631
And she bought the fields
da Mirenne

02:06:37.632 --> 02:06:39.332
and moreover
Want the forest?

02:06:41.899 --> 02:06:43.698
You make me ashamed.

02:06:46.247 --> 02:06:48.643
The war is hardly over
and they already fight

02:06:48.644 --> 02:06:50.744
for a piece of land
who was Constant's?

02:06:53.548 --> 02:06:54.848
Constant does not even know

02:06:54.849 --> 02:06:56.567
in what lands
was buried.

02:06:58.505 --> 02:07:01.187
You do not know when
he will rediscover his lands.

02:07:25.976 --> 02:07:28.511
They will end
if understood

02:07:34.861 --> 02:07:36.778
I'd rather see them that way.

02:07:39.346 --> 02:07:41.200
They were again what they were.

02:07:59.742 --> 02:08:02.170
<i> They say that to be happy </ i></i>

02:08:02.171 --> 02:08:04.787
<i> Love is indispensable </ i></i>

02:08:04.788 --> 02:08:07.288
<i> What he does

<i> And the pleasant existence </ i></i>

02:08:10.067 --> 02:08:12.320
<i> So let's love </ i></i>

02:08:12.321 --> 02:08:15.780
<i> The deceived heart
For this lie </ i></i>

02:08:15.781 --> 02:08:19.218
<i> But happiness
It is a vain dream </ i></i>

02:08:19.219 --> 02:08:22.932
<i> For it must be confessed: </ i></i>

02:08:23.292 --> 02:08:28.954
<i> Loves are fragile </ i></i>

02:08:28.955 --> 02:08:33.506
<i> Sermons are easy </ i></i>

02:08:33.507 --> 02:08:37.304
<i> Like toys
Of little children </ i></i>

02:08:37.305 --> 02:08:40.974
<i> One should not look
What's inside </ i></i>

02:08:40.975 --> 02:08:45.144
<i> We think they are solid </ i></i>

02:08:45.145 --> 02:08:49.552
<i> But unfortunately,
They are empty </ i></i>

02:08:49.553 --> 02:08:53.490
<i> At the slightest shock
Let them come and hurt them </ i></i>

02:08:53.491 --> 02:08:57.452
<i> Crac! Here it is!
Loves to break </ i></i>

02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:00.754
<i> And now I understand </ i></i>

02:09:00.755 --> 02:09:02.914
<i> Thanks to lots of experience </ i></i>

02:09:02.915 --> 02:09:04.865
<i> That the heart
Truly passionate </ i></i>

02:09:04.866 --> 02:09:06.994
<i> It is for all existence </ i></i>

02:09:06.995 --> 02:09:11.238
<i> This is just a song
Save only music </ i></i>

02:09:11.239 --> 02:09:13.804
<i> Do not take it for granted </ i></i>

02:09:13.805 --> 02:09:16.320
<i> This cheerful refrain
Uncountable </ i></i>

02:09:16.774 --> 02:09:21.568
<i> Loves are fragile </ i></i>

02:09:21.569 --> 02:09:26.196

<i> One should not look

02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:38.152
<i> We think they are solid </ i></i>

02:09:38.153 --> 02:09:42.826

<i> At the slightest shock

02:09:46.507 --> 02:09:50.666
<i> Crac! Here it is!
Loves to break </ i></i>

02:09:53.095 --> 02:09:56.267
<i> Sweetheart </ i></i>

02:09:56.268 --> 02:10:00.309
<i> When the moon
Illuminated the plain </ i></i>

02:10:00.310 --> 02:10:02.499
<i> With noisy tunes </ i></i>

02:10:11.428 --> 02:10:17.251
<i> You, sometimes, on the hills </ i></i>

02:10:17.252 --> 02:10:22.949
<i> Wrapped in the tender breeze </ i></i>

02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:28.501
<i> Heard the divine song </ i></i>

02:10:28.502 --> 02:10:34.415
<i> Who sings wheat
Flowering </ i></i>

02:10:35.569 --> 02:10:38.487
<i> Sweetheart </ i></i>

02:10:38.488 --> 02:10:43.087
<i> When Heaven Will Come Down
About the Earth </ i></i>

02:10:43.088 --> 02:10:45.390
<i> And that the nightingale </ i></i>

02:10:45.391 --> 02:10:49.970
<i> Come sing yet </ i></i>

02:10:49.971 --> 02:10:53.411
<i> When the wind </ i></i>

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:58.343
<i> Blowing on the Earth
From heathers </ i></i>

02:10:58.344 --> 02:11:02.201
<i> We will listen </ i></i>

02:11:02.202 --> 02:11:06.115
<i> The golden wheat song </ i></i>

02:11:06.116 --> 02:11:11.811
<i> We will listen
The golden wheat song </ i></i>

02:11:11.812 --> 02:11:15.578
<i> You sometimes
About the branches </ i></i>

02:11:15.579 --> 02:11:19.817
<i> On time
In what they sing the ears </ i></i>

02:11:19.818 --> 02:11:23.907
<i> Heard their voice
And the murmur </ i></i>

02:11:23.908 --> 02:11:28.719
<i> On the edge
Two Sleeping Valleys </ i></i>

02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.987
<i> You know
This deep voice </ i></i>

02:11:34.322 --> 02:11:40.167
<i> You will return
At the end of the day </ i></i>

02:11:40.168 --> 02:11:46.167
<i> Sing in the middle
To the blonde crop </ i></i>

02:11:46.168 --> 02:11:52.121
<i> RefrÃ£o full of love? </ i></i>

02:11:52.907 --> 02:11:56.459
<i> Sweetheart, when the night will come
About the Earth </ i></i>

02:11:56.460 --> 02:12:00.012
<i> Sweetheart, when the night will come
About the Earth </ i></i>

02:12:00.263 --> 02:12:05.499
<i> And that the nightingale
Come sing yet </ i></i>

02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:09.994
<i> When the wind </ i></i>

02:12:10.029 --> 02:12:14.626
<i> Blowing on the Earth
From heathers </ i></i>

02:12:14.661 --> 02:12:18.680

The golden wheat song </ i></i>

02:12:28.420 --> 02:12:33.569
<i> Sweetheart,
Let's go in the dark </ i></i>

02:12:33.570 --> 02:12:37.117
<i> Dreaming of songs
of spring </ i></i>

02:12:37.363 --> 02:12:40.895
<i> While the perfume of roses </ i></i>

02:12:40.930 --> 02:12:46.022
<i> They will come to embalm
Our twenty years </ i></i>

02:12:46.023 --> 02:12:51.584
<i> Let's love each other
Under these beautiful branches </ i></i>

02:12:51.824 --> 02:12:57.616
<i> Because nature
You will always have </ i></i>

02:12:57.617 --> 02:13:03.558
<i> The sun to gild the branches </ i></i>

02:13:03.809 --> 02:13:07.066
<i> And roses
For our loves </ i></i>

02:13:07.067 --> 02:13:10.323
<i> And roses
For our loves </ i></i>

02:13:10.324 --> 02:13:14.040
<i> Sweetheart, when the night will come
About the Earth </ i></i>

About the Earth </ i></i>

Come sing yet </ i></i>
