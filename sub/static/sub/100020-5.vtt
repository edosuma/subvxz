41:12.400 --> 41:13.230
Baby.

>> kim: Okay.
My doctor tells me that the baby

41:16.100 --> 41:18.400
my doctor tells me that the baby
is still breech, so they will

41:18.400 --> 41:19.700
is still breech, so they will
need an aversion.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.610

because it could flip back, even

41:33.990 --> 41:35.350

while she's in labor.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.790

I think we're talking about a
fairly long process.

41:38.660 --> 41:39.890
Fairly long process.
>> kim: So they're gonna have to

41:39.890 --> 41:41.590

do the aversion, and just put
her right into labor, and induce

41:44.530 --> 41:45.800
her right into labor, and induce
the baby, because they can't

41:45.800 --> 41:47.500
the baby, because they can't
risk the baby turning again.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.170
Risk the baby turning again.
So the baby's coming tomorrow.

41:50.170 --> 41:54.110
