00:28.941 --> 00:30.109
Birds?

00:30.192 --> 00:31.858
The great Genghis Khan demands

00:31.883 --> 00:34.721
a tribute of birds from our enemy?

00:34.781 --> 00:37.199
Not birds, young Kublai.

00:38.410 --> 00:41.538
Chinese swallows. Ten thousand.

00:46.376 --> 00:48.795
You question your grandfather?

00:48.878 --> 00:51.464
No, Lord Genghis. Merely curious.

01:03.142 --> 01:05.144
[Genghis sighs heavily]

01:10.232 --> 01:13.736
Nesting birds and well-fed dogs

01:13.820 --> 01:17.235
always return
to the walls of their master.

01:18.088 --> 01:20.367
You understand, don't you, Kaidu?

01:26.165 --> 01:29.531
Live by the laws of the Blue Sky

01:30.002 --> 01:36.175
and you will follow in the steps
of your father who follows in mine.

01:37.760 --> 01:42.391
You will one day be
Khan of the Mongols, child.

01:47.937 --> 01:49.271
[sighs]

01:59.616 --> 02:01.118
Release it.

04:51.495 --> 04:56.542
[man chuckling] I like you, round-eye.
I like how you drink baijiu.

04:57.669 --> 05:04.008
But no round-eye can drink
more white poison than Skinny Crane.

05:04.091 --> 05:06.468
- [crowd cheering]
- [man laughing]

05:08.137 --> 05:10.514
You hear the words of Skinny Crane?

05:10.598 --> 05:13.851
He says you will soon
fall on your white, Latin ass.

05:15.812 --> 05:20.063
Tell the gentleman
that one of the mysteries of the Far East

05:20.524 --> 05:25.696
is how a fat bastard like him
got the name "Skinny Crane."

You know what I think?

05:51.347 --> 05:53.099
I can hardly wait.

05:53.182 --> 05:56.435
I think you are a round-eyed devil.

05:57.353 --> 06:02.024
The Mongols now own this city.
But a Latin shit like you?

06:03.317 --> 06:05.820
By what authority are you here?

06:43.900 --> 06:46.944
[Marco] It's time. Let's go.

06:47.028 --> 06:48.487
[coins jingling]

06:54.410 --> 06:55.995
[indistinct chatter]

07:15.097 --> 07:17.141
[Mei Lin] I am hunted by the Khan's men.

07:18.059 --> 07:20.311
A friend within Cambulac
helped me escape.

07:22.604 --> 07:25.691
[man 1] You cannot stay here.
You are a danger to the cause.

07:25.775 --> 07:28.486
- I seek safe passage.
- [man 2] To where?

07:28.569 --> 07:31.072
To the Boy Emperor, Zhao Xian.

07:34.283 --> 07:35.716
You know who I am.

07:41.165 --> 07:44.752
- Your brother was a great hero.
- [Mei Lin] Yes, he was.

07:46.045 --> 07:48.061
His name inspires loyalty.

07:48.464 --> 07:53.760
His name inspires me
to join the Emperor's guard and refuge.

07:54.595 --> 07:57.556
May Song dynasty rise and endure.

08:03.896 --> 08:08.275
As an imperial of the great Song,
you must know the story

08:09.068 --> 08:13.105
of how a sadness so great
formed the River of Tears.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.472
His Holiness is sheltered
from such sadness,

08:17.284 --> 08:22.123
so that he knows only the lotus blossom
and flocks of doves.

08:28.462 --> 08:30.324
If she were meant to find the Emperor,

08:30.882 --> 08:33.217
her brother would've given her
the information she seeks.

08:37.013 --> 08:38.347
[Mei Lin] Help me to the refuge.

08:38.429 --> 08:42.934
Let me stand by His Holiness
as I have stood by him since his birth.

08:43.019 --> 08:44.896
We cannot take the chance.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.943
Mongols!

08:52.611 --> 08:54.696
[soldiers exclaiming in Cantonese]

09:04.415 --> 09:05.832
You.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.254
Come with me.

09:24.977 --> 09:26.563
[Mei Lin sighs heavily]

09:26.645 --> 09:28.939
- Did you find him?
- We're close.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.203
- You know you don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do.

09:51.921 --> 09:53.111
My heart is full.

09:55.257 --> 09:56.367
As is mine.

10:09.063 --> 10:10.898
[men urging horses]

10:47.383 --> 10:50.229

[whip cracking]

11:40.154 --> 11:42.740
[both panting]

11:42.823 --> 11:45.409
What are you doing?
The capture is meant to be symbolic.

11:45.492 --> 11:47.453
You wouldn't respect me
if I made it easy on you.

11:47.536 --> 11:50.539
[laughing] I doubt you will
in future, as well.

11:50.622 --> 11:53.584
I have quite an exemplar to live up to.

11:56.587 --> 11:58.880
[Jingim] If my mother's your exemplar,
I'm in trouble.

12:03.844 --> 12:05.220
Byamba.

12:07.431 --> 12:08.724
[Kokachin] He came.

12:09.850 --> 12:10.950
Of course.

12:20.361 --> 12:21.863
[Kublai] <i>Speak, Governor.</i>

12:21.945 --> 12:27.408
Great Khan, no longer is there
a divide between North and South.

12:27.493 --> 12:30.787
You have unified all China, my Grace.

12:30.871 --> 12:34.332
- [Kublai grunts]
- My Emperor, you are adored.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.127
What is your concern?

12:37.886 --> 12:39.588
Speak freely.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.468
We welcome the paper currency
of the new dynasty.

12:44.551 --> 12:48.055
And may I say Your Holy Personage
is quite handsome.

12:48.139 --> 12:49.556
[Kublai shushing]

12:50.182 --> 12:54.061
But one note is equivalent
to 50 Chinese notes.

12:55.604 --> 12:58.857
The people of my province voice concern.

12:59.294 --> 13:01.735
- Which province, again?
- Wuji.

13:02.278 --> 13:04.321
Ask my subjects in Wuji

13:04.405 --> 13:07.491
if they've lived better under
the Cricket Minister Jia Sidao,

13:07.574 --> 13:09.999
the corrupt pretender I saved them from.

13:11.223 --> 13:15.123
[sighing] They bow to the new emperor.
They cherish and adore.

13:15.452 --> 13:19.170
They simply voice concern
over the trade rate

13:19.253 --> 13:21.338
and also rising taxes on silver.

13:21.799 --> 13:23.382
Is Wuji not the same province

13:23.465 --> 13:26.677
that had its crops destroyed
by locusts days before harvest?

13:27.128 --> 13:28.595
Yes, Great Khan.

13:28.679 --> 13:31.567
Did we not send grain
to feed the farmers?

13:32.058 --> 13:34.226
The people, their children, the poor?

13:34.464 --> 13:36.979
- You did, Great Khan...
- [Kublai] So, I'm confused.

13:37.063 --> 13:39.190
Did we charge you for our bounty?

13:41.024 --> 13:44.758
- No, Great Khan.
- Then I grant you leave

13:45.237 --> 13:48.032
to return to the fortunate
province of Wuji

13:48.583 --> 13:52.744
to speak of nothing else but goodwill
of your Khan and Emperor.

13:53.704 --> 13:54.892
Great Khan.

13:55.289 --> 13:59.751
But first... eat, drink,
laugh well on this day.

13:59.835 --> 14:03.254
And thank you for attending
my heir's wedding.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.535
[Ahmad] Your petition
has been heard, Governor.

14:19.938 --> 14:21.607
[sighing]

14:22.608 --> 14:23.942
Fifty to one?

14:25.026 --> 14:26.906
If my Khan and Royal
Father wishes to look

14:26.931 --> 14:29.179
east and west to expand
his territories...

14:30.157 --> 14:32.451
the empire's coffers must also expand.

14:35.329 --> 14:36.353
[Kublai] West.

14:37.831 --> 14:40.876
As the Governor said,
they bow and cherish, hmm?

14:41.918 --> 14:45.160
- Who's next?
- The Sultan of Khwarazm.

14:45.589 --> 14:47.674
- [groans] Not him.
- Trade matters.

14:50.093 --> 14:51.762
[indistinct clamoring]

14:51.845 --> 14:54.222
I've already missed Capture the Bride.

14:55.141 --> 14:57.559
I don't want to miss the archery games.

14:59.436 --> 15:00.812
[sighing]

15:03.399 --> 15:05.567
[grunting]

15:07.986 --> 15:09.530
[sighing]

15:12.032 --> 15:13.374
[exhales heavily]

15:13.950 --> 15:16.745
- [music playing]
- [crowd chanting in Mongolian]

15:21.375 --> 15:23.627
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

15:25.921 --> 15:28.840
When men drink and tell stories...

15:29.591 --> 15:33.595
they tend to hide within the stables.
Why?

15:34.763 --> 15:38.517
It is the perfect repository
for horse manure.

15:48.777 --> 15:51.613
What words of wisdom
have you for me, Sifu,

15:51.697 --> 15:55.617
on this most auspicious of days?

15:56.785 --> 15:59.058
I have taught you
the ways of Wudang Fist.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.813
I have taught you the scholar's sword

16:00.872 --> 16:05.043
and how to fight five opponents
from the eight trigram circle.

16:05.961 --> 16:08.922
But I have no secrets to share
on how to manage your four wives.

16:09.005 --> 16:10.256
[both chuckling]

16:10.341 --> 16:13.344
On this, may the goddess of mercy
be with you.

16:14.052 --> 16:15.345
[chuckles softly]

16:16.722 --> 16:18.724
[smacks lips and sighs]

16:18.807 --> 16:21.477
Look out there. Listen.

16:21.949 --> 16:24.897
The empire you will one day inherit
is growing.

16:24.980 --> 16:27.858
Spreading under the banner
of your father's house.

16:28.942 --> 16:30.308
The larger it becomes...

16:30.652 --> 16:33.489
the larger a target
is the heir to the throne.

16:33.572 --> 16:36.158
Do you try to shrink my resolve
on my wedding night?

16:36.580 --> 16:39.495
No, I try to inspire it...

16:39.578 --> 16:42.038
as I have since you were 12 summers old.

16:42.122 --> 16:43.581
[chuckles]

16:45.584 --> 16:49.045
[smacks lips and sighs]
Tastes like dog piss.

16:49.129 --> 16:52.173
I recommend plum wine
from the southern regions.

16:56.303 --> 16:57.763
You drank the whole bowl.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.348
I did.

17:11.859 --> 17:14.863
- [Byamba] Brother.
- [Ahmad] This is a surprise.

17:14.945 --> 17:16.232
I've come to see my father.

17:16.913 --> 17:19.910
On the day of our brother's wedding?
Well, he's busy.

17:19.992 --> 17:21.815
I have urgent business from the capital.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.751
You're standing in the capital.

17:24.204 --> 17:25.915
And I know all its business.
What's yours?

17:25.999 --> 17:28.334
Just tell him his son
is here to see him.

17:28.808 --> 17:30.171
Which is it?

17:30.253 --> 17:33.006
Urgent business from the capital
or his son?

17:33.089 --> 17:34.465
[Byamba] Just tell him.

17:36.677 --> 17:39.137
Why don't you visit the baths,
change your clothes?

17:39.220 --> 17:41.264
And the Khan will receive you
when he receives you.

17:41.348 --> 17:42.892
I'll wait right here.

17:46.895 --> 17:50.065
[men singing in Mongolian]

18:21.430 --> 18:24.850
- [woman 1] You'll be a beautiful bride.
- [Kokachin] Thank you.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.392
[woman 2] Yeah, be happy.

18:34.735 --> 18:37.571
The boys are encouraged
to drink away their nerves,

18:37.654 --> 18:41.116
yet we must face this day
sober as stone.

18:47.456 --> 18:49.540
Others you can mislead, my sweet.

18:50.584 --> 18:55.484
My son, he sees what he wishes.
My husband, what he decrees.

18:56.339 --> 19:00.718
But I see what is in front of me
without filter or fiction.

19:09.853 --> 19:14.065
A brave face on a most unhappy daughter.

19:14.149 --> 19:18.444
[chuckling] Thank you, Empress, but no.

19:18.529 --> 19:19.989
I was not asking.

19:21.281 --> 19:22.189
I wish to tell you something

19:22.214 --> 19:25.017
of your Latin and I want you receptive.

19:27.203 --> 19:31.457
He was a boy abandoned by his father
to a strange land.

19:32.668 --> 19:35.446
- I was there.
- What chance had that boy?

19:36.004 --> 19:38.932
What hope of a future
in this foreign and dangerous world?

19:40.341 --> 19:43.553
None... if not for my husband.

19:43.637 --> 19:45.556
[Chabi sighing heavily]

19:46.557 --> 19:48.560
You cannot compete with Kublai.

19:50.393 --> 19:52.020
You will never mean as much to the Latin

19:52.103 --> 19:54.815
as the man who holds
his future in his hands.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.861
You cling to a fragment
of a broken soul.

20:01.780 --> 20:05.510
His morals will be determined
by what my husband asks of him,

20:05.951 --> 20:07.828
as will his actions. [inhales sharply]

20:07.911 --> 20:11.582
Nothing more, nothing less, and certainly
nothing to do with you, so...

20:19.172 --> 20:21.717
You have been greatly blessed, child.

20:23.051 --> 20:27.556
When the sun sets today,
you will be wife and mother to gods.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.270
Mother to Khans.

20:34.187 --> 20:35.480
[Chabi inhales deeply]

20:35.564 --> 20:39.025
As my mother always said,
"Peasants marry for love,

20:39.109 --> 20:42.904
royalty for a cause
greater than themselves."

20:44.490 --> 20:50.287
Our dear Blue Princess,
blessed and cursed with royal blood...

20:52.706 --> 20:55.376
let us today be greater than ourselves.

20:58.086 --> 20:59.301
Do you understand?

21:00.881 --> 21:03.216
[softly] I do, Mother.

21:15.270 --> 21:16.687
[chuckling softly]

21:56.227 --> 21:58.146
[coughing]

21:59.856 --> 22:00.857
[spits]

22:01.775 --> 22:03.902
- Bad wine. [groans]
- In every province?

22:04.945 --> 22:07.405
As it turns out, yes.

22:08.364 --> 22:09.991
[clanking]

22:11.326 --> 22:12.368
Orders are orders.

22:12.452 --> 22:15.038
And you follow them
like a good foreign errand boy.

22:15.652 --> 22:18.750
If this boat tips over and I go in,
will you be my white savior?

22:18.834 --> 22:20.335
[Marco] You don't need saving.

22:21.002 --> 22:23.505
Who would save me
if you chose to turn shackle to noose?

22:24.922 --> 22:25.716
Not them.

22:33.139 --> 22:36.101
Lotus blossoms and flocks of doves?

22:36.184 --> 22:37.642
What does that mean?

22:38.186 --> 22:42.899
Flocks of Doves is a tree that grows
on the palm islands in the river bottom.

22:43.609 --> 22:45.527
My brother used to store
currency and weapons there

22:45.611 --> 22:48.042
for the day he might be forced
to flee Xiangyang.

22:49.364 --> 22:51.074
We saw to it that he did not.

22:54.953 --> 22:56.830
You were there when he perished.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.793
Did he fight to the end?

23:03.253 --> 23:04.295
He did.

23:05.588 --> 23:08.133
That deserves praise.

23:09.516 --> 23:12.053
You hated him. It's well known.

23:13.513 --> 23:14.785
He was my brother.

23:15.932 --> 23:18.935
You still hated him. [sniffing]

23:19.019 --> 23:20.729
Seeing life now, back in Quinsai,

23:20.812 --> 23:23.881
a city of such beauty
ravaged by barbarians...

23:24.524 --> 23:26.105
I wonder if he was right.

23:26.609 --> 23:29.737
The Khan fully intends
to right these wrongs.

23:29.821 --> 23:31.194
By hunting down a child.

23:31.219 --> 23:34.350
A child your people
call "Son of Heaven."

23:35.535 --> 23:37.995
When they see him walk side-by-side
with the Great Khan,

23:38.079 --> 23:41.626
they will come to embrace
the birth of a new dynasty.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.503
- You're certain of this?
- I am.

23:45.628 --> 23:47.297
Then behold, errand boy.

23:59.225 --> 24:02.979
The people of South China,
so ready to embrace their new emperor...

24:03.980 --> 24:06.316
they have taken their own lives.

24:20.831 --> 24:22.708
Boatmen, stay your course.

24:24.710 --> 24:26.253
[indistinct conversations]

24:29.172 --> 24:30.838
[Ahmad] When do you make
your pilgrimage?

24:31.424 --> 24:33.593
[sighs heavily] Fortnight, God willing.

24:33.676 --> 24:36.387
Transport Minister, Vice Regent,
Left Chancellor...

24:36.685 --> 24:39.600
The Khan's given you more titles
than he has consorts in his harem.

24:39.682 --> 24:41.392
He honors me with lack of sleep.

24:41.476 --> 24:42.893
- [laughs]
- [clearing throat]

24:44.229 --> 24:45.688
The Khan will see you now.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.778
Lord Ahmad, you called for me?

24:53.696 --> 24:57.141
Prince Nayan of Manchuria,
this lovely creature is Ling,

24:57.408 --> 24:59.827
daughter of the former
Emperor Duzhong of China.

25:01.162 --> 25:03.830
[Nayan] I have met great sultanas
and Persian queens,

25:03.913 --> 25:06.752
and you, little one,
have the bearing of a princess.

25:06.835 --> 25:09.087
Ling, these great men have traveled far.

25:09.170 --> 25:12.257
- Will you play for them while they wait?
- Of course, Lord Ahmad.

25:19.830 --> 25:21.374
[playing lute]

25:33.736 --> 25:35.496
[scoffing] A warrior pope.

25:35.864 --> 25:39.159
He wielded no weapon.
Merely the word of Christ.

25:39.242 --> 25:41.828
You believe that to be
a powerful weapon.

25:41.912 --> 25:45.331
As a Christian and a Mongol,
let me be clear...

25:46.082 --> 25:48.737
should trouble come my way,
I will pocket the book

25:49.210 --> 25:50.503
and carry the sword.

25:53.924 --> 25:56.885
[grunting]

25:59.137 --> 26:00.931
[laughing]

26:02.348 --> 26:04.711
- Uncle.
- My Khan.

26:05.268 --> 26:07.562
[grunting] Please. Sit.

26:08.604 --> 26:11.691
Hmm, these crusades must come to an end.

26:12.692 --> 26:15.486
Only when the non-Christian
threat is extinguished.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.878
Shared goals of mutual annihilation...

26:18.323 --> 26:20.951
without one army outweighing
the other ten-fold,

26:21.801 --> 26:23.328
is destined for bloody stalemate.

26:23.411 --> 26:25.246
Someone will win.

26:25.956 --> 26:27.373
[Kublai] Hmm.

26:27.457 --> 26:29.334
Ahmad has granted you safe passage

26:29.417 --> 26:31.586
to your little gathering
in the Latin East?

26:31.968 --> 26:33.338
He has, Great Khan.

26:33.744 --> 26:35.654
Make sure he has more than he needs.

26:35.966 --> 26:38.134
- Sire.
- [Kublai grunts]

26:38.218 --> 26:41.221
When you're finished kowtowing
at the foot of your pope...

26:42.222 --> 26:43.976
- [chuckling]
- ...return to me with word.

26:44.682 --> 26:45.766
Of?

26:45.851 --> 26:48.633
Anything that might be
deemed significant.

26:49.062 --> 26:51.272
You mean anything you deem significant.

26:51.356 --> 26:53.691
[Kublai laughing]

26:54.234 --> 26:58.363
Tell your pope I look forward to the day
of meeting him in his city.

26:59.155 --> 27:01.392
Enjoy what remains of the day.

27:01.741 --> 27:03.951
- We will share a cup later?
- Oh, we'll share several...

27:04.320 --> 27:07.256
- if I can get outside.
- [both chuckle]

27:09.082 --> 27:10.291
[Kublai grunts]

27:18.091 --> 27:19.760
Your prodigal son's returned.

27:23.179 --> 27:24.890
He wouldn't dare
miss his brother's wedding.

27:25.490 --> 27:27.400
He wishes to speak with you, urgently.

27:27.683 --> 27:29.767
Send him to me as I dress.

27:39.404 --> 27:42.246
Would you have done... as they did?

27:42.657 --> 27:44.659
You can't speak the words, can you?

27:45.660 --> 27:48.495
Even though you're
partly responsible for it.

27:49.830 --> 27:52.382
Would I have drowned myself
amidst the mangroves?

27:53.834 --> 27:54.776
No.

27:56.712 --> 27:58.881
If your daughter weren't alive
behind the walls of Cambulac...

27:58.965 --> 28:02.343
Well, she is.
So don't waste your breath.

28:05.138 --> 28:09.225
How dull your life must've been at home
to make this your new one.

28:10.768 --> 28:13.191
- I didn't choose it.
- But you do now...

28:13.854 --> 28:15.815
- and don't even know why...
- Quiet.

28:15.898 --> 28:18.317
[overlapping chatter in Cantonese]

28:18.401 --> 28:20.111
Let me out.

28:22.447 --> 28:23.551
Let me out.

28:25.075 --> 28:27.452
[whispers] What will they think
when they see me in shackles?

28:33.624 --> 28:35.837
- [Byamba] Father, I must...
- [Kublai] I did not bid you speak.

28:38.296 --> 28:39.285
Nervous?

28:41.132 --> 28:42.676
What man would not be?

28:44.552 --> 28:47.138
To leave his father's house
on a day of glory

28:47.222 --> 28:49.221
and go to dwell with a rival?

28:50.266 --> 28:51.973
What man would be at ease

28:51.998 --> 28:54.919
knowing that some might
doubt his motives?

28:56.147 --> 29:00.485
Dwelling in a traitor's camp.
"Spy," some might whisper.

29:01.402 --> 29:03.363
Eyes of the empire upon him.

29:04.280 --> 29:08.910
What man would not stand here atremble
before his father and Khan?

29:10.745 --> 29:12.747
I'll tell you which man.

29:14.624 --> 29:17.502
My son, Byamba. [chuckling]

29:18.794 --> 29:21.797
Because he knows
he's always welcome home...

29:22.590 --> 29:24.092
wanderlust or not.

29:24.175 --> 29:26.594
Especially on the day
of his brother's wedding.

29:27.553 --> 29:29.930
- It's good to see you well, Father.
- [laughs]

29:30.015 --> 29:32.058
I miss you on the hunts.

29:34.310 --> 29:38.523
- Father, I must speak to you.
- [grunts] Come, walk with me.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.818
We will see the sheep's neck
break together. [laughing]

29:44.487 --> 29:46.012
[Kublai] How's the wrestler girl?

29:46.489 --> 29:50.285
- She is... like no other.
- [chuckling]

29:50.368 --> 29:51.953
And neither are you, Byamba.

29:53.079 --> 29:55.248
You might be born of a concubine,

29:55.331 --> 29:58.334
but never disparage,
or hide from your mother's blood.

30:00.253 --> 30:01.712
You never speak of her.

30:04.174 --> 30:05.508
She was Javanese.

30:06.717 --> 30:07.802
Very, very tall.

30:09.262 --> 30:11.222
- Father...
- I accept your apology.

30:11.306 --> 30:13.516
Let's raise a cup to your brother
and speak of nothing else.

30:13.599 --> 30:15.325
I come with word from Kaidu.

30:22.483 --> 30:23.332
Speak.

30:27.655 --> 30:29.114
I said, speak.

30:35.330 --> 30:37.916
Lord Kaidu is challenging your claim
to the Mongol throne.

30:40.793 --> 30:42.595
He's calling for a Kurultai.

30:44.839 --> 30:46.090
You fool.

30:46.924 --> 30:50.010
He sent you. He used you against me.

30:50.095 --> 30:53.056
No, Father. I asked, I chose.

30:54.265 --> 30:56.642
- You chose?
- Yes.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.687
If you had to hear this,
I wanted you to hear it from me.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.356
Oh, you thought it would soften the blow?

31:01.439 --> 31:03.733
- To have it come from my own blood?
- I did...

31:11.282 --> 31:12.450
Get out.

31:24.379 --> 31:25.671
[Marco grunts]

31:25.755 --> 31:26.964
Don't speak.

31:28.299 --> 31:31.970
You have followed the river a long way...
[spits]

31:34.805 --> 31:37.392
just to get fucked and die.

31:40.936 --> 31:44.857
- State your business.
- Doing yours. Hunting spies.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.985
- And taking them where?
- This one is special.

31:48.068 --> 31:50.029
A white pet of the barbarian devil.

31:50.112 --> 31:53.616
I am to deliver his head
to the Imperial Majesty.

31:54.005 --> 31:56.536
No one travels beyond this point.

31:58.163 --> 31:59.580
Execute the foreigner here.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.958
[gasps]

32:06.003 --> 32:09.131
As for you, spy hunter...

32:24.021 --> 32:26.857
- Red Lotus.
- What is left of them.

32:26.941 --> 32:29.944
They are to send us black powder
and more arms.

32:30.027 --> 32:35.658
The Mongols guard the river at Quinsai,
but the supplies will come soon.

32:35.741 --> 32:39.579
If I don't deliver as promised,
they might never come.

32:51.341 --> 32:52.592
Let's go!

32:52.675 --> 32:54.427
Let them pass.

33:00.350 --> 33:01.517
[exhales]

33:09.775 --> 33:12.220
[Kublai] I took the wall
that no Khan could topple.

33:12.820 --> 33:17.742
I conquered the 300-year-old dynasty,
I expanded the Mongol Empire,

33:17.825 --> 33:21.496
and Kaidu would challenge me
to a Kurultai?

33:21.579 --> 33:22.580
[court murmuring]

33:22.663 --> 33:25.627
And on the day
of our crown prince's wedding, no less.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.669
Impeccable, our good cousin, Kaidu.

33:28.753 --> 33:32.298
The Mongols will never back
that sheep-fucker in an election.

33:32.382 --> 33:34.009
I am their Khan.

33:35.092 --> 33:38.722
The only Kurultai that should be called
is the one to condemn him to death.

33:40.419 --> 33:44.226
Kaidu has no horse to mount
in such a challenge.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.729
Unless, of course,
he tries to raise a tempest out of dust.

33:47.061 --> 33:49.982
"Dust"? What do you mean, "dust"?

33:50.065 --> 33:51.852
The slurs from years ago, Sire.

33:52.443 --> 33:54.654
That our Khan
might not have been fairly elected.

33:54.737 --> 33:55.988
[laughing]

33:57.323 --> 34:01.828
If Kaidu wishes to challenge his Khan
with drunken rumors, let him.

34:01.911 --> 34:03.979
[Jingim] You are not only his Khan,
Father...

34:04.668 --> 34:07.291
but the first Mongol
to become Emperor of China.

34:07.833 --> 34:09.460
[Hundred Eyes] Precisely.

34:09.543 --> 34:13.755
How can the Khan of Mongolia
oversee the affairs of his motherland

34:14.340 --> 34:17.635
when he now must govern
all of China and outwards?

34:17.717 --> 34:20.137
It is a doomed prospect.

34:20.219 --> 34:21.847
[court murmuring]

34:22.848 --> 34:26.643
This is what they will say.
This is how they will challenge you.

34:26.726 --> 34:28.813
- Respectfully, Sire.
- [Kublai grunts]

34:28.896 --> 34:30.735
Then let the many voices
of the motherland

34:30.761 --> 34:32.130
choose who should be Khan.

34:34.444 --> 34:35.777
Whom would you elect?

34:36.821 --> 34:38.331
Our Royal Father,

34:38.697 --> 34:41.909
who has grown this Mongol Empire
larger than even Genghis dreamed?

34:41.992 --> 34:43.409
[court shouts approval in Cantonese]

34:43.494 --> 34:45.054
Or Kaidu?

34:45.705 --> 34:48.400
Who wants not for expansion,
but Mongol isolation.

34:49.123 --> 34:50.960
There will not be many voices.

34:52.168 --> 34:54.629
Only one. Mine.

34:54.714 --> 34:57.300
- [door creaking]
- This is what I say...

34:58.092 --> 35:01.721
Just as I took my brother's head,
I will take my cousin's.

35:02.763 --> 35:03.848
[Chabi] Enough!

35:04.974 --> 35:09.635
As Empress of this court,
I dismiss this council at once.

35:10.506 --> 35:13.316
Jingim, your attendants await you.

35:13.399 --> 35:17.570
Don your robes, present your gifts,
and prepare for the final vow.

35:17.653 --> 35:19.280
[court murmuring]

35:25.285 --> 35:27.537
[Kublai] You would dismiss
my war counsel?

35:31.459 --> 35:34.212
Don't soil this day
with talk of tomorrow.

35:35.588 --> 35:38.007
It is time for the Khan's toast.

35:38.090 --> 35:40.042
- The wedding must go...
- The wedding?

35:40.175 --> 35:41.969
The quest for an heir?

35:42.595 --> 35:45.806
What is this all for if not
tomorrow, hmm?

35:48.518 --> 35:49.519
What?

35:50.269 --> 35:51.395
Open.

35:54.524 --> 35:55.775
[grunting]

36:02.114 --> 36:03.532
Rain stones.

36:04.534 --> 36:06.911
My gift to you on our own wedding day.

36:11.206 --> 36:16.503
Any man who rises to greatness will face
envy from his brothers, his relations.

36:17.838 --> 36:19.840
You stand above them all,

36:19.924 --> 36:22.843
because you know
compassion is the greatest shield.

36:24.344 --> 36:28.598
Have compassion for these smaller men...
smaller minds.

36:31.436 --> 36:32.770
[sighing]

36:32.853 --> 36:36.524
I once drowned my own dog
when he would not stop killing sheep.

36:37.650 --> 36:39.194
Is that not compassion?

36:41.946 --> 36:45.324
There will be no Kurultai. Only war.

36:47.660 --> 36:52.873
Your mind was far from war on that day...
was it not?

36:56.418 --> 36:57.657
I remember.

36:58.921 --> 37:01.757
- I remember it well.
- [chuckling]

37:01.841 --> 37:03.551
Capture the bride.

37:06.261 --> 37:11.725
That fiery Onggirat girl...
who could ride a horse like a wind demon.

37:14.103 --> 37:16.689
I, too, think much on it.

37:18.941 --> 37:20.359
More so of late.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.529
You fought me well, like a Mongol queen.

37:26.741 --> 37:28.033
That's when I realized

37:28.058 --> 37:32.229
just how formidable ally
my Chabi would become.

37:33.748 --> 37:35.692
I sniffed your cheek.

37:37.376 --> 37:40.004
And you stabbed me
with an elk-horn knife.

37:40.087 --> 37:41.505
[chuckling]

37:42.548 --> 37:43.966
And I will do it again

37:44.049 --> 37:46.426
if you don't come out
and give the royal blessing

37:47.051 --> 37:48.721
like the Khan you are.

38:00.775 --> 38:01.942
[Byamba] Brother.

38:03.068 --> 38:04.528
[Jingim] You would call me
"brother" now?

38:04.612 --> 38:06.531
[Byamba sighing] The news was coming.

38:06.614 --> 38:08.366
The only question was who carried it.

38:09.283 --> 38:11.952
Better a stranger
than to be stabbed by blood.

38:12.787 --> 38:15.415
I wish you well, brother, always.

38:17.750 --> 38:19.853
To say that is also why I came.

38:21.796 --> 38:23.037
I wish you hadn't.

38:34.183 --> 38:35.434
[Kokachin exhaling]

38:39.521 --> 38:40.908
You do not look pleased.

38:41.533 --> 38:42.649
Relations.

38:43.734 --> 38:46.070
One cannot select them
as we do our friends.

38:46.153 --> 38:47.446
[chuckles]

38:50.991 --> 38:55.287
[sighing] Just some clan trouble
in the old capital.

38:57.748 --> 38:59.584
The old capital is far from here.

39:01.543 --> 39:03.878
Let it remain that way tonight.

39:08.008 --> 39:11.220
You are beautiful, truly.

39:12.638 --> 39:14.474
And you are most handsome.

39:21.772 --> 39:23.941
I know that this is
beyond your choosing.

39:26.276 --> 39:30.781
And I have been foolish
to not recognize my blessing.

39:37.412 --> 39:41.375
I give you my word, and I stand by it.

39:42.752 --> 39:45.671
What I say in this moment
must live only between us two.

39:51.927 --> 39:53.763
[softly] I am tremendously drunk.

39:55.055 --> 39:56.473
You hide it well.

39:58.267 --> 39:59.393
Do I?

40:00.645 --> 40:03.731
No, not at all.

40:03.814 --> 40:05.566
[laughing]

40:09.528 --> 40:13.076
Still, I speak the truth
when I say that I will protect you...

40:14.158 --> 40:16.702
in this life,
and for many years to come.

40:19.079 --> 40:22.750
And I will honor you,
not only as Imperial Lady, but...

40:24.584 --> 40:25.669
as friend...

40:32.092 --> 40:34.553
and a most excellent rider.

40:36.138 --> 40:37.347
[chuckles]

40:39.850 --> 40:44.897
I will be a faithful and devoted wife.

40:47.983 --> 40:53.280
[breathes deeply] And now...
I give your gift.

40:55.282 --> 40:56.366
Early.

41:04.458 --> 41:05.750
[exclaims softly]

41:14.719 --> 41:15.928
[Jingim moans]

42:08.898 --> 42:11.401
[singing in Mongolian]

42:17.197 --> 42:19.408
[Kublai] As my grandfather said,

42:20.075 --> 42:22.494
"Nesting birds and well-fed dogs

42:22.961 --> 42:25.915
always return
to the walls of their master."

42:56.320 --> 42:58.280
- [monkey screeches]
- [men exclaim]

42:59.781 --> 43:01.783
[men laughing]

43:05.245 --> 43:08.623
[woman singing in Mongolian]

44:11.020 --> 44:13.063
[singing continues]

45:21.966 --> 45:25.595
[drums beating]

46:15.935 --> 46:17.812
[door creaking]

46:23.693 --> 46:25.237
I'm Jia Mei Lin,

46:25.936 --> 46:29.240
sister of the great,
last Chancellor of the Song Empire.

46:30.034 --> 46:31.786
May it rise and endure.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.539
I have come to be reunited
with my Emperor.

46:39.251 --> 46:41.003
I recognize your voice...

46:42.421 --> 46:45.007
but not the words of praise
for your brother.

46:53.682 --> 46:55.642
[both grunting]

47:01.481 --> 47:02.816
[men exclaiming]

47:10.490 --> 47:11.616
[man groans]

47:22.001 --> 47:23.503
[gasping]

47:25.380 --> 47:27.257
[drums beating]

48:06.921 --> 48:08.297
[men grunting]

48:12.177 --> 48:14.013
[grunting]

48:19.601 --> 48:21.811
[drums beating]

48:25.940 --> 48:28.610
As it is said of man and woman...

48:30.059 --> 48:35.534
the hunter is ours,
the sable weaver is yours.

48:37.076 --> 48:41.414
But if the sable weaver has
no mother and father to stand with her,

48:42.374 --> 48:44.251
what does this mean?

48:45.502 --> 48:47.004
It means only this...

48:49.173 --> 48:51.425
she, too, is now ours.

48:53.260 --> 48:59.934
I take this child into my house...
as my daughter.

49:12.612 --> 49:14.781
Now you will feel no rain,

49:14.864 --> 49:18.076
for each of you will be
shelter to the other.

49:19.244 --> 49:21.763
Now you will feel no cold,

49:22.706 --> 49:25.542
for each of you will be
warmth to the other.

49:26.585 --> 49:29.045
I know it's hard to imagine, Ling...

49:30.672 --> 49:33.175
but someday, you, too, will be married.

49:34.175 --> 49:36.510
[Kublai] The Mongol Empire
holds both your fates in our hands.

49:36.595 --> 49:38.180
Perhaps even to a prince.

49:39.097 --> 49:41.933
[Kublai] And these fates
are now merged...

49:44.228 --> 49:45.730
[grunting]

50:13.089 --> 50:14.298
[sword clatters]

50:33.860 --> 50:35.194
[grunts]

51:05.684 --> 51:08.812
Deliver to us, the rightful heir...

51:10.355 --> 51:16.111
<i>who shall one day rule the Earth...
under the mandate of heaven.</i>

51:48.560 --> 51:52.397
- Let this marriage be made.
- [court cheering]

52:01.030 --> 52:02.866
[court cheering continues]

52:10.164 --> 52:11.708
[flies buzzing]

52:26.556 --> 52:28.267
My father accepts.

52:49.829 --> 52:51.831
[dramatic music playing]
