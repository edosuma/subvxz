00:11.305 --> 00:15.225
Tonight, The Stig climbs into a
bucket of hot wallpaper paste.

00:15.225 --> 00:20.945
Richard sorts out public transport
and James gets beaten up by a boat.

00:26.545 --> 00:28.465
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:28.465 --> 00:35.705
Hello! Hello, and we start...we
start with something strange.

00:35.705 --> 00:43.385
Cos you see, last year, you couldn't
buy a BMW unless you were a cock.

00:43.385 --> 00:46.105
LAUGHTER
But then all of a sudden,

00:46.105 --> 00:50.865
people with huge watches and
stupid Oakley sunglasses, people who

00:50.865 --> 00:55.305
tailgate you on motorways, suddenly
started to buy Audis instead.

00:55.305 --> 00:59.145
No idea why, don't really care
because, what this means

00:59.145 --> 01:02.905
is normal people with normal watches
can buy for the first time ever,

01:02.905 --> 01:04.985
what, if we're honest, has
always been

01:04.985 --> 01:08.865
the best sports saloon of them all,
the M3.

01:10.185 --> 01:12.625
Some people are saying
this new model

01:12.625 --> 01:16.305
is too soft and too squidgy,
but I'm not one of them.

01:23.945 --> 01:27.945
The fact is that last year we
showed the two-door coupe version

01:27.945 --> 01:33.385
was way faster round the track than
its rivals from Audi and Mercedes.

01:34.905 --> 01:39.225
And now, your children can have
their spleens crushed as well,

01:39.225 --> 01:42.585
because this is the new
four-door version.

01:44.425 --> 01:47.225
It has the same equipment
as the coupe we tested,

01:47.225 --> 01:50.985
has the same butch front-end and
despite the extra weight,

01:50.985 --> 01:54.025
the performance is almost
identical as well.

01:55.065 --> 01:59.305
Of course, with the two extra doors
and a bigger boot, incidentally,

01:59.305 --> 02:02.665
you would expect the saloon to
be more expensive than the coupe.
