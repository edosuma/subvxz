00:04.648 --> 00:06.893
So, Hyde, how are you doing now
that you and Jackie are broken up?

00:06.928 --> 00:08.706
Ooh, I am the old Hyde again...

00:08.730 --> 00:11.491
kept by no woman,
loyal to no man.

00:12.510 --> 00:14.546
Beholden to no comb.

00:15.470 --> 00:18.160
No, Steven does so
use a comb.

00:18.196 --> 00:20.376
It's one
of those afro picks.

00:21.704 --> 00:24.273
You should wear it
sticking out of your hair.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.400
Hello, Steven.

00:30.962 --> 00:31.768
Jackie...

00:33.024 --> 00:34.138
You wanna talk?

00:34.814 --> 00:36.271
What would I have
to say to you?

00:36.982 --> 00:38.864
I don't know.
How about, um...

00:39.445 --> 00:42.016
"I'm a crazy, spoiled
whack job and I'm sorry"?

00:43.533 --> 00:45.950
That's no way to talk
to a woman.

00:47.432 --> 00:50.334
Yeah, especially a spoiled,
crazy whack job.

00:51.116 --> 00:53.060
Man,
she's liable to kill you.

00:56.378 --> 00:57.977
Oh, my god.

00:58.430 --> 01:00.646
There's a hundred morons
in my basement.

01:02.376 --> 01:03.632
That's okay.

01:03.774 --> 01:05.789
Not even that can ruin this day.

01:05.824 --> 01:09.195
Yes, one man and only one man,
has the power to ruin his day.

01:09.657 --> 01:10.973
'tis I.

01:12.691 --> 01:14.445
No, not even you can do it.

01:14.919 --> 01:17.158
But really,
who the hell talks like that?

01:18.166 --> 01:20.666
Now, now, Red.
You were happy, remember?

01:20.715 --> 01:21.675
Right.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.358
First freeze of winter.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.384
I'm spending the day
ice fishing.

01:26.072 --> 01:29.717
Well, I'll come with you.
Grab a fishing stick for me.

01:30.764 --> 01:32.043
I don't wanna go.

01:34.148 --> 01:35.172
What? Why not?

01:35.216 --> 01:37.142
Because
I don't want you to go.

01:37.858 --> 01:39.596
Shh-Shh... burn!

01:43.811 --> 01:45.599
Really, I mean, Kitty,

01:45.634 --> 01:48.687
you'd hate it.
It's cold and boring,

01:48.734 --> 01:52.034
and we both know the only ice
you like is in your cocktails.

01:52.973 --> 01:53.957
Shh-Shh...

02:00.016 --> 02:01.296
Nonsense.

02:01.342 --> 02:05.523
We're going ice fishing and
we're gonna have fun and that's that.

02:05.958 --> 02:06.768
Yeah.

02:07.672 --> 02:08.776
That's that.

02:13.085 --> 02:16.488
Jackie, seriously, isn't there anything
you wanna say about what you did?

02:17.157 --> 02:20.233
No. I have much more important
things to do with my day.

02:20.844 --> 02:22.652
Donna, what are we doing
with our day?

02:24.414 --> 02:25.823
I'm going to karate class.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.748
Oh, I knew it would be
something sweaty.

02:28.629 --> 02:29.639
You don't have to go.

02:29.662 --> 02:31.999
No, no, no, I'm going.
I'm going.

02:32.298 --> 02:36.316
Now that I'm not with Steven, I have much more
time to do mannish, unlady like things with you.

02:39.721 --> 02:41.823
I'll give you 50 bucks
to take her back.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.641
50 bucks buys me beer
for a week.

02:45.111 --> 02:47.147
Freedom lasts a lifetime.

02:49.284 --> 02:50.423
Oh,

02:50.623 --> 02:52.642
look at our poor
little tough guy,

02:52.748 --> 02:55.378
hurting others
to ease his own pain.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.730
I think someone
needs a tickle.

03:01.771 --> 03:03.121
No, I'm okay.

03:07.606 --> 03:10.541
Look, Hyde, we're your best friends
and we're here for you, okay?

03:10.576 --> 03:12.654
We're not gonna let you
go through this thing alone.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.697
Would you shut up, forman?
I'm fine.

03:14.756 --> 03:19.222
You know what? Eric's right. We're gonna
do what guys do for each other.

03:19.434 --> 03:21.160
A massage train?

03:23.778 --> 03:24.541
No...

03:26.303 --> 03:28.017
but we did
get you a present.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.151
It's a great present, guys.

03:30.304 --> 03:32.934
I especially like the teeny white
paper y'all wrapped it in.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.849
Yeah, the only thing
that could ruin today is...

03:35.873 --> 03:39.677
if the Russians set off that Russian death ray
that's pointed at the white house.

03:40.546 --> 03:41.791
No, seriously.

03:42.143 --> 03:43.890
No, I read about it
in a magazine.

03:44.853 --> 03:46.638
Kelso, that was "the flash"

03:47.201 --> 03:49.103
and it is a comic book.

03:50.348 --> 03:51.675
I love comic books.

03:51.710 --> 03:53.654
I wish I had
thought bubbles.

03:55.862 --> 03:57.083
Do you see anything?

03:58.692 --> 03:59.654
Kelso,

03:59.901 --> 04:01.709
the Russians
don't have a death ray,

04:01.815 --> 04:04.830
but they do have a stupid ray
and it's pointed directly at you.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.623
No, the Russians do have a
death ray and I'll prove it.

04:09.926 --> 04:12.676
Operator,
get me the white house.

04:13.369 --> 04:14.555
Kelso,

04:15.260 --> 04:18.089
I'm not allowed to make long-distance
calls without permission.

04:18.829 --> 04:22.337
Oh, awesome. I'm on hold and they're
playing that theme song to the president.

04:22.924 --> 04:24.357
"Hail to the chief."

04:25.191 --> 04:28.079
Well, thank you, Eric, but I'm trying to
enjoy the president's theme song.

Kelso, if you ask the white house if there's a russian
death ray, they're gonna have you committed.

05:12.404 --> 05:14.224
So, yeah,
I say go for it.

05:15.798 --> 05:20.177
Well, obviously they won't admit it.
There'd be panic in the streets.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.866
That's why I gotta trick 'em
into talking about it.

05:22.901 --> 05:25.614
It's what us cops call
"tricking them."

05:27.340 --> 05:30.276
Oh, I'm on. Hello?
Uh, white house?

05:30.499 --> 05:33.363
Yes, I have a couple
of questions.

05:33.798 --> 05:37.813
Yes, how well
is the president protected?

05:40.948 --> 05:43.003
Well... uh...

05:43.038 --> 05:46.065
because someone wants
to hurt the president, that's why.

05:47.721 --> 05:52.114
You're damn right it's a threat.
It's a terrible threat on the president's life.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.275
Awesome.

05:56.729 --> 05:57.568
What?

05:57.604 --> 05:59.353
Where am I right now?

05:59.377 --> 06:01.198
I'm at Red Forman's house
in Point Place, Wisconsin.

06:01.229 --> 06:02.535
- No!
- No!

06:05.552 --> 06:07.548
You idiot. You just
told 'em where we are.

06:07.586 --> 06:08.368
So?

06:08.420 --> 06:11.275
Kelso, you just threatened
the president's life.

06:11.423 --> 06:13.184
They're gonna come here
and arrest us.

06:13.331 --> 06:15.574
No, no,
I'm not threatening his life.

06:15.609 --> 06:18.204
It's the Russians that have
the Russian death ray.

06:18.732 --> 06:21.245
You didn't mention
the death ray.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.737
Aha!

06:23.773 --> 06:25.980
So you admit
that there's a death ray.

06:42.716 --> 06:44.407
Well, this is boring.

06:47.448 --> 06:51.003
Let's do something fun.
Oh, oh, let's play 20 questions.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.633
Kitty, I'm trying to fish.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.109
Okay, you think of something,
I'll ask the questions.

06:57.661 --> 06:58.964
Is it a thing?

06:59.807 --> 07:00.641
Yes.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.686
Is it small?

07:01.721 --> 07:02.507
Yes.

07:02.543 --> 07:03.623
Is it a raisin?

07:03.646 --> 07:04.668
Yes, you win.

07:09.174 --> 07:10.923
Well,
you're not even playing.

07:11.534 --> 07:14.035
What's so great
about ice fishing anyway?

07:14.094 --> 07:15.902
It was the solitude.

07:17.135 --> 07:19.065
Well, I'm freezing.

07:19.418 --> 07:22.717
This is like that winter we locked
ourselves out of our first apartment.

07:22.752 --> 07:25.699
We had to sit on the stoop
cuddled up for two hours

07:25.735 --> 07:27.860
waiting for the landlord
to bring the key.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.244
And then we had to warm ourselves up in front
of the stove because the heater was broken.

07:39.598 --> 07:41.794
We could warm each other up
right now.

07:42.299 --> 07:43.168
Ah, what the hell?

07:50.648 --> 07:53.395
There's a black Ford Sedan
outside. Hyde's right.

07:53.419 --> 07:55.098
The Feds found us.

07:55.462 --> 07:56.718
Damn it, Kelso.

07:56.742 --> 07:59.675
You finally figured out how to use
a phone, now we're all going to jail.

08:03.104 --> 08:05.111
Look, I think you guys
are overreacting.

08:05.162 --> 08:08.274
There's no way the government would
park a car right outside my house.

08:08.309 --> 08:09.143
Forman,

08:09.331 --> 08:12.254
anything you think the government's
not doing, they are doing.

08:12.466 --> 08:15.181
The only thing they didn't do
is land a man on the moon.

08:16.308 --> 08:17.412
No, no, no, no, no.

08:17.447 --> 08:20.348
Spielberg shot the entire thing
on a hollywood movie set.

08:21.193 --> 08:23.154
That's how he got the job
for "jaws."

08:23.399 --> 08:25.794
Guys, if that's
the Feds' car outside,

08:25.841 --> 08:28.084
we better dispose
of the evidence right now.

08:28.762 --> 08:30.183
Oh, yeah.

08:31.768 --> 08:34.211
Good job disposing
of all the evidence, you guys.

08:35.303 --> 08:37.263
You better
take this serious, Eric.

08:37.309 --> 08:41.457
We have a lot of evidence to dispose of, even
more than we had at the Pink Floyd concert.

08:42.126 --> 08:44.053
Yeah, there is a lot,

08:44.335 --> 08:47.070
and without all
the smoke machines and lasers,

08:47.235 --> 08:49.020
this is just like punishment.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.476
Man, I never thought
I'd say this,

08:53.122 --> 08:55.471
but I wish there were more
people to share this with.

08:58.547 --> 08:59.756
This is a nightmare.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.938
White suit with yellow belt?

09:02.666 --> 09:05.848
Okay, Jackie O. couldn't even
pull this off on easter.

09:06.423 --> 09:08.361
Donna-san,
you've brought a friend?

09:08.663 --> 09:10.812
Yes, sensei.
This is Jackie.

09:11.059 --> 09:12.362
Welcome, Jackie-san.

09:12.397 --> 09:15.027
Today we'll be focusing
on self-defense.

09:15.063 --> 09:17.928
Let's say someone is accosting
you in a dark alley.

09:18.174 --> 09:19.980
Oh, that doesn't work for me.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.536
I'd never be in an alley,
'cause I'm not poor.

09:25.146 --> 09:28.741
And even if I was ever in an alley,
I'd have a boy with me to protect me.

09:29.727 --> 09:32.005
Jackie, you're not always
gonna be with a guy.

09:32.346 --> 09:33.895
You're not with one now.

09:35.962 --> 09:37.571
And, no, I don't count.

09:39.297 --> 09:41.598
An assault can happen
anywhere, Jackie-san.

09:41.645 --> 09:44.111
The point is someone
wants to do you harm.

09:44.310 --> 09:45.825
But they don't.

09:45.884 --> 09:49.089
All right, maybe someone would follow
these other women to do them harm,

09:49.122 --> 09:53.314
but when people follow me, it's to ask me where
I get my hair done or to just give me presents.

09:55.521 --> 09:56.601
That's true.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.294
- I've seen it.
- Yeah.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.358
This is our third circle, and it hasn't
calmed me down at all.

10:10.073 --> 10:12.417
I feel almost more suspicious
than before!

10:13.298 --> 10:15.130
I don't wanna get sent back
to my home country.

10:15.165 --> 10:17.549
If I return in shame,
I'll get stoned...

10:17.690 --> 10:20.074
and then
they'll throw rocks at me.

10:20.790 --> 10:23.385
Everybody,
just settle down, okay?

10:23.418 --> 10:24.640
Settle down!

10:24.769 --> 10:26.671
You are all losing your minds!

10:26.718 --> 10:28.749
Who is yelling?!
Who is yelling?!

10:30.816 --> 10:31.532
We all

10:31.884 --> 10:32.694
just need
to

10:33.255 --> 10:34.054
keep

10:34.594 --> 10:35.498
calm.

10:35.698 --> 10:38.551
That's the door!
We're all gonna die!

10:40.638 --> 10:43.092
It's okay, it's okay.
I know what to do.

10:43.127 --> 10:47.413
Okay, Eric, you answer the door,
we'll all sneak out the back.

10:48.658 --> 10:49.397
What?

10:49.538 --> 10:52.745
Yeah, yeah. No, no, you'll go to jail,
I'll pull some strings to get you out.

10:52.792 --> 10:56.855
Point Place P.D. has connections with the FBI.
One of our dogs transferred from there.

10:57.794 --> 10:59.239
Shh! Shh!

11:06.269 --> 11:08.371
May I speak
to your parents?

11:11.048 --> 11:12.261
There's no need.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.384
I'll go quietly.

11:16.476 --> 11:20.304
Uh, I'm just delivering the hand-vac
Mrs. Forman ordered.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.376
Okay, I'm the one who called,
and all I was saying

11:26.399 --> 11:28.583
is beware of the death ray.

11:29.628 --> 11:31.487
Yeah, I'll do that.

11:32.027 --> 11:34.387
By the way, the whole neighborhood
can smell what you're doing.

11:39.011 --> 11:42.264
Oh, my god. Did you see his earpiece?
He's definitely FBI.

11:42.604 --> 11:45.587
There's no other reason why a man
would be wearing an earpiece.

11:45.634 --> 11:48.334
Oh, don't punt.
You've got one yard to go.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.552
Guys, I read about this.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.430
That's the recon guy.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.565
He's the one
that plants the bugs.

11:55.601 --> 11:58.583
I hate bugs. Is it on me?
Is it on me?

11:59.241 --> 12:00.063
No,

12:00.473 --> 12:03.162
like a bug,
like a microphone.

12:03.198 --> 12:04.254
Oh, my god.

12:05.522 --> 12:07.436
We've been infiltrated.

12:16.478 --> 12:18.287
Guys, if this vacuum is bugged,

12:18.651 --> 12:21.040
the FBI could be listening
to us right now.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.894
Well, I think the important
thing is to stick together.

12:24.023 --> 12:26.066
You know what?
You are absolutely right, Fez.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.850
This is all for one
and one for all.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.136
you're looking
for Michael Kelso.

12:35.707 --> 12:37.318
Quit it!

12:37.342 --> 12:39.678
No, I'm not gonna quit it, okay?
This is all your fault.

12:39.702 --> 12:41.005
You called the white house.

12:41.040 --> 12:44.140
My fault? This is Hyde's fault
'cause he's the one

12:44.173 --> 12:46.580
who got dumped by Jackie,
so we had to be nice to him.

12:46.615 --> 12:49.081
Hey, hey, hey!
Go easy on the kid!

12:49.927 --> 12:52.639
Letting go of Jackie was the
biggest mistake he ever made.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.795
Remember? We were talking
about it earlier behind his back.

12:57.334 --> 13:00.753
Shut up, Fez. If I wanted your advice,
I'd kick you in the nads.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.804
Oh, in that case, my advice is
please don't kick me in the nads.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.327
Hey, guys, you know what?
Maybe the FBI has an opinion

13:09.351 --> 13:12.580
'cause they'relistening to us.
Remember?The v-a-c-u-u-m?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.699
He spelled vacuum.

13:22.836 --> 13:25.560
Whoa, whoa.
Vacuum has two us in it?

13:29.719 --> 13:31.575
No, that's messed up.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.764
Okay, well, maybe we should turn it on
and see if it's really a vacuum, and if it is,

13:37.352 --> 13:38.984
maybe we should tidy up a bit.

13:46.222 --> 13:47.455
- Aah!
- Aah!

13:56.108 --> 13:57.823
Hey, one question.

13:58.292 --> 14:00.288
If the vacuum
really was bugged,

14:00.664 --> 14:02.593
couldn't we have just
put it outside?

14:05.364 --> 14:06.245
Damn.

14:06.949 --> 14:09.403
When Kelso's the only one
thinking straight, we're in trouble.

14:11.329 --> 14:13.713
Guys, we are making
too many mistakes.

14:13.795 --> 14:16.120
We need to sit down
and figure this out.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.901
Okay, this is starting
to feel like work, man.

14:21.885 --> 14:23.787
The Feds have ruined
the circle.

14:24.457 --> 14:26.030
The circle sucks.

14:26.746 --> 14:28.273
That's right, I said it.

14:29.564 --> 14:30.348
Hey,

14:30.830 --> 14:34.423
this circle, it's the only thing
that's keeping us sharp.

14:34.693 --> 14:37.840
If it weren't for this circle, we'd have no
idea that the Feds were surrounding us,

14:37.866 --> 14:40.285
planting bugs everywhere,
watching our every move.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.551
So I say thank you to the circle.

14:44.547 --> 14:45.827
I just want everyone to know...

14:47.518 --> 14:49.532
I'm prepared to fight
my way out of here.

14:58.977 --> 14:59.999
You know,

15:00.139 --> 15:02.582
I don't even care
if the fish aren't biting,

15:02.817 --> 15:05.599
'cause nothing could beat
hanging out with my girl.

15:07.572 --> 15:10.348
Well, in that case,
I have another idea for a game.

15:10.876 --> 15:13.788
It's like 20 questions but sexy.

15:15.538 --> 15:17.029
I call it

15:17.393 --> 15:19.818
sexy 20 questions.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.507
Okay,

15:23.282 --> 15:24.703
I'll ask the questions.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.190
Is it something I want?

15:29.738 --> 15:32.591
Every saturday,
twice on christmas.

15:37.425 --> 15:38.611
I got a bite!

15:53.506 --> 15:54.879
Good, Donna-san.

15:55.009 --> 15:56.065
Jackie-san,

15:56.089 --> 15:58.552
would you like to try the move
that Donna-san just performed?

15:58.881 --> 16:02.498
But none of this self-defense
stuff applies to me.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.623
Okay, I've said it before
and I'll say it again..

16:04.682 --> 16:05.980
Everyone

16:06.109 --> 16:07.307
loves me.

16:09.279 --> 16:10.547
You don't understand.

16:10.700 --> 16:14.222
I am a stranger who
wants to hurt you.

16:16.134 --> 16:18.447
I'm not buying it.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.606
Okay, Jackie, let's say
he's not a stranger.

16:21.770 --> 16:24.013
Let's say he's someone
who already hurt you,

16:24.659 --> 16:26.124
like Hyde.

16:26.406 --> 16:27.674
What about him?

16:27.709 --> 16:31.373
Well, you asked Hyde for a tiny glimmer of hope
that you guys would end up married one day,

16:31.526 --> 16:33.651
but he said,"I don't know.

16:34.825 --> 16:36.220
"I don't know,"

16:36.819 --> 16:40.083
as if Jackie Burkhart
weren't special at all.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.126
Watch it, Donna.

16:42.173 --> 16:43.192
I mean,

16:44.707 --> 16:47.795
I mean, i thought
Jackie Burkhart was special,

16:48.370 --> 16:51.691
but according to Hyde,
you're no better than me.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.749
All men are bastards!

16:58.090 --> 17:01.745
That jerk didn't want me!
I'm better than everyone!

17:01.792 --> 17:04.303
He lost the best thing
when he lost me!

17:04.352 --> 17:08.047
And it's not Jackie-san!
It's Jackie! Just...

17:08.189 --> 17:11.019
Jackie! Nothing more than Jackie!

17:11.051 --> 17:13.424
Get it right, Dork-san!

17:17.569 --> 17:18.309
Oh!

17:20.105 --> 17:21.898
I love karate.

17:26.571 --> 17:28.051
I can not believe it.

17:28.827 --> 17:31.549
Now they have
a surveillance van outside.

17:33.968 --> 17:35.752
I hope they're not
taking pictures.

17:37.091 --> 17:38.418
I'm a little puffy.

17:40.047 --> 17:42.195
Okay, this has gone too far.

17:42.242 --> 17:43.898
We didn't do anything wrong.

17:44.297 --> 17:49.381
What kind of country is this if you can't make
one threatening phone call to the white house?

17:51.881 --> 17:53.701
Let's find out what's
really going on here.

17:53.724 --> 17:54.722
Yeah.

17:59.097 --> 18:00.036
Whoa.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.231
You know that's not
a real weapon, right?

18:05.757 --> 18:06.579
I know.

18:07.472 --> 18:10.687
Not even if you really,
really believe.

18:12.765 --> 18:13.693
I don't.

18:18.078 --> 18:19.581
Don't let me down, baby.

18:25.546 --> 18:28.035
wait a minute.
It's just a dogcatcher van.

18:28.093 --> 18:31.857
Or hello? That's exactly what
the Feds want us to think.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.041
I just heard
dogs barking inside.

18:34.088 --> 18:37.141
It's obviously a tape recording
of trained dogs.

18:37.927 --> 18:39.924
The barking
is too self-conscious.

18:40.164 --> 18:43.041
Plus a dogcatcher van wouldn't
just say "dogcatcher"on the side

18:43.076 --> 18:45.812
of it 'cause otherwise the dogs
would see it and just run away.

18:46.575 --> 18:47.315
On three.

18:47.618 --> 18:49.955
1, 2, 3!

18:55.978 --> 18:57.469
I don't understand.

18:59.317 --> 19:01.806
Look, I don't know
if it's the fresh air talking,

19:02.252 --> 19:05.375
but I'm starting to think this whole thing
is just our imagination.

19:06.244 --> 19:07.780
You know what, you guys?

19:08.837 --> 19:12.817
Maybe we just need to let this whole
fantasy world of ours go. Whoa.

19:13.768 --> 19:16.210
Watch out, man. I almost just cut
you right in half there.

19:24.259 --> 19:25.774
Kitty, I'm sorry.

19:26.713 --> 19:29.157
I didn't mean to throw
you to the floor.

19:31.458 --> 19:34.558
It's just that that was the first fish
I caught this year.

19:35.603 --> 19:37.561
That was a nice perch.
It was a big perch.

19:37.608 --> 19:39.604
Might've been
a state-record perch.

19:42.856 --> 19:45.874
If it means anything,
you're my state-record lady.

19:51.631 --> 19:54.837
Okay, I guess I forgive you.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.639
I knew you'd understand.

19:59.461 --> 20:01.727
I mean, fish are really hard to catch,

20:01.786 --> 20:03.735
but you I can't rid of.

20:05.426 --> 20:07.187
Can't get rid of me?

20:08.529 --> 20:09.422
I... I...

20:09.621 --> 20:12.557
I can't get rid of
you from my heart.

20:14.682 --> 20:17.089
You see what happens
when you come fishing?

20:20.030 --> 20:21.943
So there's one thing
I don't get.

20:22.437 --> 20:24.715
If nobody
was after us all day,

20:25.172 --> 20:28.037
then why did the Feds
send a spy vacuum?

20:29.731 --> 20:31.422
Why don't you call
them up and ask?

20:32.514 --> 20:34.146
- That's a good idea.
- No!

20:35.637 --> 20:37.422
You don't get
to touch that

20:37.715 --> 20:38.549
anymore.

20:39.901 --> 20:42.930
Okay.
So, Hyde, first day without Jackie...

20:43.623 --> 20:45.736
Not a good start, huh?

20:47.803 --> 20:48.742
Are you kidding, man?

20:48.977 --> 20:50.994
I haven't burned out
this hard in years.

20:52.321 --> 20:55.280
I'd do it all again tomorrow, but I'm exhausted.
I might have to go back to work.

20:56.301 --> 21:00.102
Look at our brave little boy
hiding his sadness behind bluster.

21:01.558 --> 21:04.599
Don't worry. I'm sure Jackie's just
as miserable as you are.

21:05.116 --> 21:06.572
Oh, I feel so good.

21:06.607 --> 21:09.695
This is so much better than staying
home all day crying about Steven.

21:10.165 --> 21:12.199
You were a total badass.

21:12.234 --> 21:14.359
Well, I'm not afraid of anything.

21:14.394 --> 21:16.344
- Oh, my god! Aah!
- Aah!

21:24.101 --> 21:29.279
Oh my god! There was a pack of wild dogs over there! I had
to climb to the top of this giant thing to get away from them!

21:29.758 --> 21:30.638
Hu...

21:30.908 --> 21:32.282
That was me!

21:33.726 --> 21:35.088
Dogs ha?

21:36.192 --> 21:37.965
What did you do?

21:38.084 --> 21:39.258
Nothing! We...

21:39.293 --> 21:42.698
Kelso thought there was a death ray, so we
called the White House then the Feds came but..

21:42.757 --> 21:43.873
Wait..

21:44.143 --> 21:45.305
It was just a vacuum.

21:45.857 --> 21:48.311
Okay, I'm cutting you guys off.
Where is your stash?

21:50.860 --> 21:52.375
It's all gone, man!
