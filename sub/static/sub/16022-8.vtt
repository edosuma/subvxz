WEBVTT

00:04.704 --> 00:06.772
(dog barking in distance)

00:10.510 --> 00:13.112
(loud, rhythmic swishing)

00:18.184 --> 00:21.220
Woman:
We invite the ritthamels for
wine and they don't show up?

00:21.222 --> 00:23.155
I mean, really,
what's next?

00:25.225 --> 00:26.759
Man:
Honey...

00:26.761 --> 00:28.460
What's that?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.196
I don't think
that's the ritthamels.

00:36.336 --> 00:37.569
Mother of...

00:41.441 --> 00:42.441
(squish)

00:42.443 --> 00:44.076
(woman shrieks)

00:44.078 --> 00:47.212
(siren wails)

00:47.214 --> 00:50.482
Brass:
Male, caucasian, in his 30s.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.618
And this
is how he rolls.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.288
Phillips:
Volume of blood loss,
lack of visible cardio activity.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.623
He's definitely dead.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.824
Couldn't have
traveled far.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.760
These folks recognize him
as a neighbor?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.262
Yes, bryce and bunny.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.230
They never saw him before,
so police officers

01:05.232 --> 01:08.233
Are knocking on doors
asking the neighbors if anyone

01:08.235 --> 01:09.768
Witnessed his wild ride.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.236
Well, what
do you think, david?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.372
This doesn't look like
the kind of damage you'd get

01:13.374 --> 01:15.174
From just being
tumbled around, does it?

01:15.176 --> 01:16.508
I think you're right.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.411
Severe blunt-force injuries,

01:19.413 --> 01:20.779
Primarily to the head and face.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.414
So, obviously a murder.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.117
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

01:25.119 --> 01:26.185
Actually, I have.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.654
It's a human hamster ball,
I believe.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.356
Saw one of these
at the state fair
with charlie once.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.326
It's airtight, waterproof,
you can roll around in a pool

01:34.328 --> 01:35.360
For five bucks until

01:35.362 --> 01:37.529
You lose your corn dogs.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.531
Brass:
State fair corn dogs.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.533
That sounds slightly more fun
than this guy's experience.

01:41.535 --> 01:42.668
All right, so we have to

01:42.670 --> 01:45.270
Figure out who he is,
where he came from

01:45.272 --> 01:47.372
And what in the spinning world
happened to him.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.676
Our entire crime scene
is inside of this bubble, david,

01:50.678 --> 01:53.445
So I want you to get this back
to the coroner's office, intact.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.114
Seriously?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.216
Y-you want me to put <i>that...</i>

01:57.218 --> 01:58.383
In my van?

01:58.385 --> 02:00.285
That'd be nice.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.189
Have a ball.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.192

Brody.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.706
Heard you guys have a big,
bloody ball of bad to work on.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.409
(chuckles) well, grave shift
always gets the good ones.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.411
Man: Glad us swing shift
guys are done.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.580
Heard you got a sexual
assault call, too.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.747
Gonna be a
busy night.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.283
I'll drink my first one
for you, huh?

03:38.285 --> 03:39.985
Mm-hmm.
(laughs)

03:39.987 --> 03:41.987
Let him gloat.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.455
I don't really like anybody

03:43.457 --> 03:44.990
That goes to bed
before sunrise, anyways.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.491
Agreed.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.994
Hey, morgan?
The sexual assault call.

03:48.996 --> 03:52.431
It's got to be our guy.
Similar victim and location.
Oh.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.466
Oh, sorry.
Dawn. Banks.

03:54.468 --> 03:57.002
Swing shift.
Hi. Seen you around. Greg.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.570
Hi.
Dawn and I worked separate

03:58.572 --> 04:00.505
Home invasion rapes last week,

04:00.507 --> 04:02.608
Realized we might be
dealing with a serial.
Yeah,

04:02.610 --> 04:04.610
Looks like
he might have struck again.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.879
Do, uh, you mind
if I work this one with you?

04:07.881 --> 04:09.781
I don't sleep anyway.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.684
Oh, um, sure.
Great. I can head out
to the scene.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.987
The victim's waiting at pd.
All right,
I'll talk to her.

04:14.989 --> 04:17.022
Okay.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.724
Good luck.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.630
I didn't see him.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.566
I-I didn't hear him.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.767
I didn't know
anything happened

04:28.769 --> 04:30.602
Until I woke up.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.904
Tell me what you can
about your night, amy.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.375
What do you remember
before you went to bed?

04:36.377 --> 04:38.577
I got off work at 8:00.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.413
I'm-I'm a cocktail waitress.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.415
Fell asleep in bed watching tv.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.050
When I woke up,

04:45.052 --> 04:47.753
My head felt all cloudy.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.892
And... I was...

04:56.529 --> 04:57.829
...Hurting.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.532
I promise you, amy,

05:00.534 --> 05:03.035
We're not gonna stop until
we hunt this animal down.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.470
I saw something on the news,

05:05.472 --> 05:07.572
That a girl
got attacked last week

05:07.574 --> 05:09.975
A mile from my place.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.777
Was this the same guy?

05:14.547 --> 05:17.382
Banks:
<i>I processed amy's condo.</i>

05:17.384 --> 05:19.017
Point of entry
was the back door.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.421
The intruder used a bump key
to bust open the lock.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.758
Just like the other scenes.
Yeah, I found some rubble,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.460
Crushed shells,
just like the last scene.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.395
Confirms it's the same guy.
Yeah. It's just,

05:30.397 --> 05:33.398
This stuff is used to pave
so many driveways around town.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.766
Could have picked
it up anywhere.

05:34.768 --> 05:38.837
Found a few small pebbles
of a different rocky material.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.107
Oh, and fibers from
a chloroform rag.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.409
He knocked amy out,
just like the others.
And then,

05:44.411 --> 05:45.944
Again with the tv.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.547
The rapist turns it on
and leaves it on.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.382
He actually didn't
turn it on at amy's.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.951
She said she likes to
fall asleep to the news,

05:52.953 --> 05:54.419
So she left it on.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.121
So this time,
there's one less thing

05:56.123 --> 05:58.990
On his sick,
twisted to-do list.

06:05.498 --> 06:06.631
You know them?

06:06.633 --> 06:09.434
Yeah, I-I thought
it was my son, tyler.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.671
I bought him a jacket
like that last christmas.

06:14.474 --> 06:17.542
He's 19. He comes home
every couple of weeks.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.144
I try to get him to stay,

06:19.146 --> 06:22.814
But then he wants to use in the
house, and then he's gone and...

06:24.117 --> 06:26.785
He's just out there.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.554
You said you don't sleep.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.491
You worry.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.597
Finlay:
No I.D. On our victim,
so we're hoping

06:38.599 --> 06:40.499
That the trace
from the outside of the ball

06:40.501 --> 06:41.933
Will help us determine its path,

06:41.935 --> 06:44.102
And where it came from
will help us

06:44.104 --> 06:45.771
With who he is.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.040
Well, however bumpy his path,
that's not what killed him.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.943
Intracerebral hemorrhage
from blunt-force trauma

06:51.945 --> 06:54.446
Is what bounced him
from this mortal coil.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.682
He was beaten with
some sort of hard implement.

06:57.684 --> 07:02.087
Small striking surface,
semicircular lacerations.
Hmm.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.523
There were marks in his
second skin, as well.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.757
Second skin?

07:05.759 --> 07:07.959
I think I missed
that anatomy class.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.095
The thin vinyl
of the ball was caught

07:10.097 --> 07:11.563
Between the weapon
and the victim.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.999
So the victim was
inside the ball,

07:14.001 --> 07:15.767
The assailant
was outside of it.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.469
And the weapon made

07:17.471 --> 07:19.538
Distinct tool marks
at the points of impact.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.640
What's the brown trace?

07:21.642 --> 07:22.974
Those are paint flecks.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.943
So, shape of the marks
plus the brown color

07:24.945 --> 07:30.081
Well, at least something good
rolled this victim's way.

07:34.554 --> 07:37.689
Forensic nurse exam
was very helpful.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.990
A swab of amy morse's neck

07:38.992 --> 07:41.226
Found male dna
and amylase.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.196
He kissed her.
Yeah. Unfortunately,
there wasn't a hit in codis.

07:44.198 --> 07:46.698
But at least now
we have a profile on him.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.933
So, gets us a little closer.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.901
Just not close enough
to stop him.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.138
(indistinct muttering)

07:53.140 --> 07:55.106
You okay there,
hodges?

07:55.108 --> 07:57.843
You're familiar with
the snowball effect?

07:57.845 --> 08:01.012
A sphere in motion
tumbles along,

08:01.014 --> 08:02.581
Picking up mass?

08:02.583 --> 08:05.917
Yeah?
Well, the human
hamster ball effect is worse.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.519
Because it affects me.

08:07.521 --> 08:08.954
To the tune of 37

08:08.956 --> 08:10.689
Different plant trace
exemplars,

08:10.691 --> 08:12.858
Each of which
I am tasked with identifying.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.259
That sucks.

08:16.896 --> 08:17.929
I like you.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.232
Now, before
this avalanche

08:20.234 --> 08:23.101
Came tumbling down on me,
I ran the very reasonable amount

08:23.103 --> 08:25.270
Of trace that
you two brought me.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.973
Crushed shell, just like
at the previous scene.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.141
What about the other rubble we
found at the point of entry?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.977
A little more interesting.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.945
"concrete and
titanium oxide."

08:33.947 --> 08:36.748
Otherwise known
as smog-eating concrete.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.284
A new, unique material
that helps reduce pollution.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.521
The chemical additive
is activated by sunlight

08:42.523 --> 08:45.156
And turns smoggy toxins into

08:45.158 --> 08:47.158
Less-harmful compounds
upon contact.
So where in vegas

08:47.160 --> 08:49.160
Can this stuff be found?
It might help us

08:49.162 --> 08:51.963
Find our assailant's
point of origin.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.698
It's in limited use nationally.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.100
Haven't had the chance
to determine

08:55.102 --> 08:58.136
If or where
it might be present in vegas.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.771
I can look into it.
You're busy.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.041
Did I mention
my fondness for you?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.277
I like her.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.814
Russell:
<i>All right, so where are we</i>
<i>on this rape case?</i>

09:09.816 --> 09:12.317
Victimology shows no links
between the three rape victims.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.053
None of them knew each other.
No shared routines.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.988
No overlaps in their lives.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.691
Other than being
this guy's type--

09:19.693 --> 09:22.294
Early 20s,
single, brunette,

09:22.296 --> 09:24.829
Living alone
in a first-floor condo.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.866
The m.O.'s consistent, right?
I mean, he waits until

09:27.868 --> 09:30.268
They're asleep, uses a bump key
on the back door lock

09:30.270 --> 09:31.970
To gain entry.
Except that

09:31.972 --> 09:34.573
At the first scene,
he passes a wide-open window

09:34.575 --> 09:35.974
He could've used for entry.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.976
He goes into
the victim's bedroom.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.945
Chloroforms her.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.680
Turns on the tv,

09:41.682 --> 09:44.349
Leaving it on while
he assaults her.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.351
Actually, amy already
had her television on,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.086
So he just
left it playing.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.621
Russell:
What if it wasn't a coincidence?

09:49.623 --> 09:51.590
Maybe it's significant.

09:51.592 --> 09:54.726
You get the feeling that
he was more prepared with amy?

09:54.728 --> 09:57.829
At the first scene,
he overlooked the open window.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.998
Second scene, he woke up a dog

10:00.000 --> 10:01.700
That got the neighbors
all excited.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.169
No missteps at amy's house, and
he picked the one night a week

10:04.171 --> 10:05.804
That she gets out
of work early.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.172
He might've been
casing her home,

10:07.174 --> 10:08.673
Known her habits.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.741
It's more than that.

10:11.877 --> 10:14.112
He knew he was gonna
have to use a bump key

10:14.114 --> 10:15.280
To break into amy's house.

10:18.250 --> 10:22.020
<i>He knew that she</i>
<i>fell asleep with the tv on.</i>

10:22.022 --> 10:23.888
He re-created those conditions

10:23.890 --> 10:26.191
In the previous
two scenes, because...

10:26.193 --> 10:28.727
The first two rapes

10:28.729 --> 10:30.929
Were rehearsals.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.999
Practice runs.

10:34.001 --> 10:37.102
I think amy morse was his
intended target the whole time.

10:48.414 --> 10:51.850
Brody:
It could be anyone, amy, um...

10:51.852 --> 10:54.219
A customer,
a coworker, a neighbor.

10:54.221 --> 10:57.222
Has anyone given you
unwanted attention?

10:57.224 --> 11:00.892
I thought this was some random
psycho attacking random women.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.694
Why would
I have known him?

11:02.696 --> 11:06.331
We now believe
the rapist may have
targeted you specifically.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.036
There is someone.

11:12.805 --> 11:16.174
My ex-boyfriend,
jared... Wallace.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.177
When I broke up with him
a couple months ago,

11:19.179 --> 11:21.880
He turned awful.

11:23.082 --> 11:26.051
Started sending me
these e-mails.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.092
(voice breaking):
When I woke up...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.728
After, I...

11:38.330 --> 11:41.166
...I could almost
smell him in the room.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.434
Jared?

11:45.005 --> 11:49.874
It was so faint, I-I thought
I was imagining it, I...

11:52.011 --> 11:54.713
We're gonna need to get
a dna sample from jared.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.415
Do you have anything from
when you guys were dating?

11:57.417 --> 12:00.318
Hairbrush, um,
article of clothing...

12:00.320 --> 12:04.089
I just wanted
to forget him.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.458
Are you even sure
her story's legit?

12:06.460 --> 12:07.959
Amy's a cocktail waitress.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.495
That's kind of how she makes
money-- leading guys on.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.097
She takes one home
and if she regrets it,

12:12.099 --> 12:14.132
Buff one of the hundred
notches out of the bedpost

12:14.134 --> 12:15.467
But don't call the cops.

12:15.469 --> 12:16.935
Enough, jared.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.103
He doesn't mean that.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.404
This is just
a stressful situation.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.340
We're just going to take
a swab of your dna,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.508
And then you're
free to go.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.243
Yeah, I don't think so.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.113
And last a lifetime
in your database.

12:28.115 --> 12:32.150
I said no, and you can't force
me unless you have a warrant.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.486
Mr. Wallace,

12:34.488 --> 12:36.488
As your son's attorney,
perhaps you should advise...

12:36.490 --> 12:39.257
I already told
him no, too.
Wait a minute.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.461
As his attorney, I have
to support his decision.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.998
Well, as his dad,
don't you think

12:47.000 --> 12:49.134
You should tell him
to man the hell up?

12:49.136 --> 12:52.971
Parent protects his kid
no matter what...

12:52.973 --> 12:55.774
Disgusting thing
the kid has done.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.375
Dad can't see it.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.277
Little boy who used
to sit on his lap

12:59.279 --> 13:01.546
Couldn't be capable
of something so awful.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.150
And if you are
clear-eyed enough

13:05.152 --> 13:07.018
To see what he has done,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.220
What does that say about
how you raised him?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.457
Jared:
Dad, come on,

13:12.459 --> 13:13.892
Let's get out of here.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.059
Banks:
Hey!

13:15.061 --> 13:19.364
You got whatever you wanted,
including amy,

13:19.366 --> 13:21.533
And when you lost her,
well...

13:21.535 --> 13:23.935
If we're wrong, prove it.

13:23.937 --> 13:24.936
Are you kidding me?

13:24.938 --> 13:27.372
You raped her, jared.

13:27.374 --> 13:31.176
Mr. Wallace:
Jared, no, no,
jared, jared, jared.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.544
Jared.
You don't know

13:32.546 --> 13:33.978
Who you're messing with.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.455
You were hoping
he would spit at you, right?

13:44.457 --> 13:46.524
Big loogie in the face
would have been nice,

13:46.526 --> 13:50.094
In his eyes let me know
we're right about him.

13:54.400 --> 13:57.068
Leave the prop alone.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.436
You guys got something
to show me?

13:58.438 --> 13:59.571
Yes.
(clears throat)

13:59.573 --> 14:01.306
Now, you know

14:01.308 --> 14:04.309
That a rolling stiff gathers
no moss, but it does gather

14:04.311 --> 14:07.345
An exhaustive
assortment of flora.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.948
That is the plant trace that
we took off of the big ball--

14:09.950 --> 14:11.916
Hodges I.D.'d it--

14:11.918 --> 14:13.284
And this is
a landscaping map

14:13.286 --> 14:15.220
That we got
from the subdivision's gardener.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.221
Each blade and bloom

14:16.223 --> 14:18.957
Meticulously plotted
and labeled.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.358
Russell:
So you're looking
for one route--

14:20.360 --> 14:22.493
Probably downhill--

14:22.495 --> 14:24.963
That makes contact with each
of the plant varieties

14:24.965 --> 14:29.968
Until it ends up in our
unfortunate couple's front yard.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.637
Took us 17 hours without a
bathroom break, but we did it.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.639
So we tracked the ball

14:34.641 --> 14:38.243
To its point of origin--
the backyard

14:38.245 --> 14:40.078
Of one zack fisk.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.618
The human
hamster himself,

14:46.620 --> 14:49.053
Rest his cardboard-
chewing soul.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.327
Russell:
<i>Back door's open.</i>

14:56.329 --> 14:59.230
Wide enough for the
hamster ball to roll out.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.132
Finlay:
Look at these fresh scuffs.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.167
Right height for the ball.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.037
So the ball knocks over
the vase,

15:06.039 --> 15:10.408
Spreads water over the carpet,
does a few donuts right here,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.043
And out the door.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.012
That is one hell of a ride

15:14.014 --> 15:15.613
Before he even got out
of the house.

15:16.448 --> 15:20.285
He was trying to escape

15:20.287 --> 15:22.287
From whoever was wielding this.

15:22.289 --> 15:26.224
Same shape as the impressions
left in the hamster ball's skin.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.927
<i>Paint must have rubbed off</i>
<i>during the assault.</i>

15:28.929 --> 15:31.963
(grunting)

15:33.699 --> 15:35.300
Texture's not
really conducive

15:35.302 --> 15:36.567
To prints.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.236
Hmm.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.704
Killer might have left
this little bit

15:39.706 --> 15:42.540
Of trace behind.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.176
Hey, jules,

15:45.178 --> 15:48.212
I think I just found
this guy's romper room.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.515
Ugh,

15:50.517 --> 15:52.984
All kinds of freaky fun.

15:54.653 --> 15:56.654
Russell:
Don't suppose

15:56.656 --> 15:58.356
He'll mind us looking
at his computer,

15:58.358 --> 15:59.524
Do you?

16:00.592 --> 16:04.329
"confinedbliss.Com--

16:04.331 --> 16:06.397
A claustrophilia oasis."
I guess

16:06.399 --> 16:08.633
That's the opposite
of claustrophobia, right?

16:08.635 --> 16:11.035
People who get off
on tight spaces.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.036
Zack fisk

16:12.038 --> 16:14.372
Is in every video.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.407
Well, let's go
to the movies.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.376
A ball like this,
with a two-way zipper,

16:18.378 --> 16:22.380
Is perfect for solo
or partner play.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.482
When sealed up,
the ball contains

16:24.484 --> 16:27.986
20 minutes' worth of oxygen, so,

16:27.988 --> 16:31.222
In 15 minutes,
the air will be thinning

16:31.224 --> 16:34.492
And my lovely playmate
will be...

16:34.494 --> 16:36.494
In bliss.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.130
Claustrophilia can bring you

16:39.132 --> 16:43.101
To full
sensory nirvana.

16:43.103 --> 16:46.204
The lack of space,
of oxygen makes you

16:46.206 --> 16:49.107
Deliciously aware
of every inch

16:49.109 --> 16:52.243
And impulse
of your body.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.646
With the strictest
of boundaries

16:55.648 --> 16:59.584
Comes the most exhilarating
liberation.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.224
Speaking of oxygen,
I could use a little.

17:06.226 --> 17:10.261
Since zack was killed
inside of the ball,

17:10.263 --> 17:12.397
His playmate's
a pretty good suspect, right?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.798
I'll figure out who she is.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.134
(doorbell rings)

17:16.136 --> 17:19.137
I got it.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.612
Hey, jules.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.050
Yeah?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.418
Package delivered.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.321
Huh, big package shows up
a day after he's murdered.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.824
What do you think?
Should we open it?

17:39.826 --> 17:41.092
Yeah.

17:41.827 --> 17:44.328
Oh, lord.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.565
Well, whatever new pervy toys
this guy just ordered,

17:47.567 --> 17:51.636
I think he went
with solid steel.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.572
(finlay groans)

17:57.843 --> 18:00.344
That is no toy.

18:00.346 --> 18:02.380
No, that's his playmate.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.514
(closes knife)

18:09.788 --> 18:13.491
Brody:
<i>Dawn, it's morgan again,</i>
<i>following up on the case.</i>

18:13.493 --> 18:15.626
Uh, I really need
to hear from you.

18:15.628 --> 18:20.364
I'm just hoping
you're, you're okay.

18:20.366 --> 18:21.666
Please call me back.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.401
Bye.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.470
Everything all right?

18:25.472 --> 18:29.273
Oh, uh, dawn banks--

18:29.275 --> 18:30.775
She didn't show up
for her shift today.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.443
When's the last time
you talked to her?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.444
Yesterday,

18:33.446 --> 18:34.745
After she got
in the face

18:34.747 --> 18:37.148
Of our rape suspect
jared wallace.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.618
Well, do you want
to do a welfare check,

18:40.620 --> 18:41.719
Swing by her house?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.855
Yeah.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.891
Door's unlocked.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.129
Dawn?

18:52.631 --> 18:54.332
Looks like she left

18:54.334 --> 18:56.834
This place
in a hurry.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.704
Yeah.
She was working.

19:01.707 --> 19:04.208
She got a response
from a smog-eating

19:04.210 --> 19:07.845
Concrete company last night.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.913
Rapist tracked
some of that stuff

19:08.915 --> 19:10.248
Into the crime scenes, right?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.750
Yeah, and according
to this e-mail,

19:12.752 --> 19:17.522
This stuff only exists on one
half-mile strip of verdugo road.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.923
Good lead.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.658
(clattering)

19:22.194 --> 19:23.928
Dawn?

19:33.438 --> 19:34.505
(grunts)

19:37.943 --> 19:42.213
Aah! The hell are you guys
doing here, huh?!

19:42.215 --> 19:43.281
Who are you guys?

19:43.283 --> 19:44.348
We're csis.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.351
It's her son.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.353
Tyler?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.355
We work with your mom.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.796
So, when's the last time
you saw her?

20:00.232 --> 20:02.433
Look, I don't know
where she is.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.434
Okay, I haven't
been here in weeks.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.435
I just came to get a bite.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.937
Sure.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.339
If she got fed up with
me, everything else,

20:08.341 --> 20:10.408
Ran off to the bahamas or
something, good for her,

20:10.410 --> 20:11.776
She deserves it.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.379
Other than that, I don't
know what else to tell you.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.548
I'm gonna get out of here,
crash somewhere else.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.684
Uh, tyler, wait.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.920
I know you have your own life
and everything, but

20:22.922 --> 20:24.889
I know your mom has been

20:24.891 --> 20:26.791
Really, really
worried about you.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.528
I think you should stay.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.230
Yeah, I'm sure
she'd be happy to see you.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.501
Look, I'm sorry.

20:38.804 --> 20:41.339
If I see her,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.674
Then I'll tell her someone
else is looking out for her.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.445
Thanks.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.506
Yeager:
Hey, brody, I heard
you're on the rape case.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.507
Stealing
the glory again?

21:16.509 --> 21:19.910
Day shift doesn't start
for another hour, yeager.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.646
Go get your
breakfast buffet on.
No.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.714
No carbs
until I make csi-3.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.316
Bumped into sidle.

21:25.318 --> 21:28.653
She looped me in
on the rape investigation.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.522
Uh, suspect tracked
two different materials

21:31.524 --> 21:32.523
Into the scene.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.991
One was, uh, crushed shells

21:33.993 --> 21:36.560
And the other was a
smog-eating concrete,

21:36.562 --> 21:39.830
Where both of these
materials exist--

21:39.832 --> 21:41.866
This trailer park.
So you think

21:41.868 --> 21:43.567
The rapist may have
originated from there?

21:43.569 --> 21:44.969
Yeah, but it still
doesn't clear

21:44.971 --> 21:47.305
Our prime suspect-- victim's ex

21:47.307 --> 21:49.807
Now, I thought he
was some rich kid,

21:49.809 --> 21:50.975
Not some trailer type.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.076
Well, this particular
trailer park has

21:52.078 --> 21:56.314
And wallace has an ecstasy
charge on his record.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.515
Okay, so wallace swings by

21:57.517 --> 21:58.749
To score something
before the rapes.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.818
There's something else.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.020
I think dawn figured
this out before I did

22:03.022 --> 22:04.488
And now she's
missing.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.023
Yeah, I heard--
no-show today.

22:06.025 --> 22:07.958
I've worked with her.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.027
That's not like dawn.
Case had her amped,

22:10.029 --> 22:12.463
So I'm thinking maybe
she found the same location.

22:12.465 --> 22:14.899
Could be she ran
into our suspect.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.401
This e-mail was the last
thing up on her computer.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.603
Maybe she went

22:19.605 --> 22:20.705
To follow up.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.673
Went to the
trailer park,

22:22.675 --> 22:24.008
And then...

22:24.010 --> 22:26.477
Oh, you think something
happened to her?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.645
I don't know.

22:27.647 --> 22:30.114
All right. I'll drive.

22:35.587 --> 22:38.656
Okay, the manager
did not recognize dawn

22:38.658 --> 22:40.024
Or jared wallace,

22:40.026 --> 22:42.626
But he said people
are in and out all hours.

22:42.628 --> 22:44.662
He give you a list
of the residents?

22:44.664 --> 22:45.830
No, he refused.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.498
Suggested we move along.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.799
(laughs)

22:48.801 --> 22:49.800
It's okay.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.370
We can do it another way.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.639
You trying dawn again?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.007
Yeah.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.378
(distant cell phone ringing)

23:00.380 --> 23:02.380
Morgan.

23:02.981 --> 23:03.781
Try her again.

23:08.153 --> 23:11.555
(distant cell phone ringing)

23:17.028 --> 23:19.163
Nothing here.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.631
This way.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.999
(ringing stops)

23:40.952 --> 23:42.987
Where the hell is she?

23:51.763 --> 23:54.064
Time for the
"postal mortem"?

23:56.802 --> 23:59.804
(finlay and robbins
groan quietly)

23:59.806 --> 24:02.173
No I.D. From
prints or dna.

24:02.175 --> 24:04.642
Well, lividity's fixed.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.811
It indicates her
orientation in the box.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.813
She was upside down.

24:08.815 --> 24:12.016
Hmm. So she was inverted
during transit.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.485
Well, autopsy will
confirm, but I'd venture

24:14.487 --> 24:17.555
Positional asphyxia was likely
the cause of death.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.024
<i>Gravity causes the organs</i>

24:20.026 --> 24:23.461
<i>To impede</i>
<i>the diaphragmatic movement.</i>

24:23.463 --> 24:27.731
<i>No movement of the diaphragm,</i>
<i>no breathing, suffocation.</i>

24:27.733 --> 24:31.202
There aren't any wounds
evident on her.

24:31.204 --> 24:33.904
It doesn't appear she
was forced into the box.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.172
That's bizarre.

24:35.174 --> 24:36.474
Well, yes and no.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.876
This woman was
a claustrophiliac.

24:38.878 --> 24:41.045
Which means that
she liked to get off

24:41.047 --> 24:43.113
By getting into
tight spaces.

24:43.115 --> 24:46.750
The babe in the box
is named melody davis.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.086
The package was shipped
from her residence

24:49.088 --> 24:51.188
Across town 36 hours ago.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.959
I also lifted some
prints from the label.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.828
Match to zack fisk.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.532
So fisk sealed his playmate up

25:01.534 --> 25:05.135
At her house,
mailed her to his house

25:05.137 --> 25:06.937
To have a thrill?
There's a catch.

25:06.939 --> 25:11.141
Melody is married to a
guy named roy davis.

25:11.143 --> 25:14.945
Brass is breaking the news
and bringing him in.

25:14.947 --> 25:17.848
Your wife's death
was accidental.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.584
She got into that box
voluntarily-- it's
part of her...

25:20.586 --> 25:22.219
Claustrophilia pursuits
that she indulged in

25:22.221 --> 25:24.989
With her friend zack fisk.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.191
But I suspect you knew
all about this, right?

25:27.193 --> 25:28.592
Yes, sir, I did.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.727
I allowed it...

25:29.729 --> 25:31.295
To save my marriage.

25:31.297 --> 25:33.030
She said she

25:33.032 --> 25:34.598
Needed her space.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.567
Or... Lack of space.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.303
She had met a man online,

25:39.305 --> 25:42.973
But she said it wasn't sex,
it was just... Play.

25:42.975 --> 25:45.910
And a couple of hours after
your wife put herself in the box

25:45.912 --> 25:47.177
And mailed herself,
I guess you

25:47.179 --> 25:49.046
Got online
and tracked the package

25:49.048 --> 25:51.148
On your home computer?
She had told me

25:51.150 --> 25:53.817
About her
shipping fantasy before.

25:53.819 --> 25:55.786
But I forbid it.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.188
It's far too
dangerous.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.724
But apparently, she
hadn't heeded me.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.127
You saw the package was
delivered to, uh, zack fisk,

26:03.129 --> 26:04.662
So you went over there

26:04.664 --> 26:06.664
And confronted
him, huh?
No, sir.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.132
That is not true.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.801
Roy, what, uh, what
line of work you in?

26:10.803 --> 26:14.104
(laughs softly)
I... Work on a ranch.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.739
Horses.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.074
Wide-open spaces.
Yeah,

26:17.076 --> 26:18.809
See, that was a trick question.

26:18.811 --> 26:20.811
We found a kernel

26:20.813 --> 26:23.814
Of your special blend
of horse feed.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.283
It was stuck
to the murder weapon.

26:28.353 --> 26:32.156
I mean, you gave this guy fisk
a lot of leeway

26:32.158 --> 26:35.092
With your own wife,
but he had

26:35.094 --> 26:37.261
To push it, right?

26:38.229 --> 26:40.130
He thought he was safe

26:40.132 --> 26:42.866
In that stupid bubble.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.835
So damn smug.

26:44.837 --> 26:48.038
I told you guys, that's
where I drew the line.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.374
If she gets hurt...
She's on the ride of her life.

26:50.376 --> 26:52.643
More excitement than
you've ever given her.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.844
And you just
wait until

26:53.846 --> 26:56.180
She arrives,
and I get to tear into

26:56.182 --> 26:57.681
That pretty little package.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.385
(grunting)

27:01.387 --> 27:05.255
(zach gasping, grunting)

27:05.257 --> 27:08.225
It was just play, she told me.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.094
I'm sorry about your wife, roy.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.763
I really am.
Unfortunately,

27:12.765 --> 27:17.101
You're gonna have to share
her love of enclosed spaces.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.909
So, pd towed in dawn's car.

27:25.911 --> 27:28.312
Found it roadside
in the middle of nowhere.

27:28.314 --> 27:31.148
Searched the immediate area--
nothing unusual,

27:31.150 --> 27:33.817
And no viable prints
on the outside.
Get to the inside yet?

27:33.819 --> 27:34.885
No, not yet.

27:34.887 --> 27:37.187
All right,
I'll take the front.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.406
I got a receipt...

27:55.408 --> 27:57.875
From a truck stop.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.877
1:00 a.M.,
the night she went missing.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.912
30 bucks.
Does it say what she bought?

28:11.322 --> 28:12.956
I've got an evidence bag.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.792
That looks like

28:14.794 --> 28:16.794
A t-shirt.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.195
Dawn might have gone rogue.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.698
You know, stealing a dna sample
from jared wallace

28:20.700 --> 28:22.800
Or maybe a suspect
from the trailer park.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.102
(sighs)

28:25.104 --> 28:28.038
The guy could've caught up
with her and...

28:28.040 --> 28:29.339
Stopped her.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.942
I think the threat
was closer to home.

28:33.812 --> 28:36.280
Her suspect was her son.

28:47.192 --> 28:48.425
Brass:
Tyler, your mom's car

28:48.427 --> 28:49.893
Was found abandoned
on the highway.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.729
She was working
a serial rape case.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.732
She was transporting
collected evidence in her car.

28:54.734 --> 28:57.034
Now, we think because
of the sequence of events

28:57.036 --> 29:00.003
And the timing of everything
that she identified the suspect,

29:00.005 --> 29:02.406
Who tracked her
to the highway location

29:02.408 --> 29:04.875
And confronted her.
Where's my mom?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.510
We pulled your rap sheet.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.278
You're a registered
sex offender.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.948
Yeah, for taking a
leak in an alleyway.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.216
You've been convicted
of burglary.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.251
What does this have
to do with anything?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.153
The rape victim, amy morse,
the one whose case

29:16.155 --> 29:17.921
Your mom was working on,
you knew her.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.157
You went to sagebrush
high with her.
Okay.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.126
There's 2,000 kids
at that school!

29:22.128 --> 29:25.963
I don't know her.
Your mom collected
a dna sample from the rapist.

29:25.965 --> 29:29.800
She also collected
a dna sample from you.

29:29.802 --> 29:33.237
Right now, the lab
is comparing them.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.474
Look, you got to get my mom.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.109
Where is she, tyler?

29:39.111 --> 29:40.878
Where's your mom?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.513
(knock at door)

29:44.149 --> 29:45.783
Captain.
Not now, officer.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.384
A detective's come from reno--
you've got to hear this.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.453
Take him out in the hallway.

29:52.257 --> 29:54.424
How you doing?

29:54.426 --> 29:56.226
Jim brass.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.461
Detective smith.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.029
Reno pd.

29:59.031 --> 30:01.398
I hear that you've been looking
for csi dawn banks.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.235
She was supposed to be coming
up our way-- never showed.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.071
What was she doing with reno pd?

30:08.073 --> 30:11.909
She was coming up to identify
her deceased son, tyler.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.978
(exhales)
that's her son right there

30:14.980 --> 30:18.048
In the hallway.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.584
Okay, let's step back.

30:20.586 --> 30:24.588
Two nights ago, reno officers
found a deceased male

30:24.590 --> 30:27.224
In a warehouse where homeless
kids were known to squat.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.993
Overdose.
Badly decomposed.

30:29.995 --> 30:33.463
Had a driver's license
identifying him as tyler banks.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.366
I called ms. Banks
to break the news.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.902
<i>She was at a trailer park</i>
<i>working a case.</i>

30:38.904 --> 30:40.103
<i>She was devastated.</i>

30:40.105 --> 30:43.407
(sobbing):
Tyler...

30:43.409 --> 30:45.475
Oh...

30:45.477 --> 30:49.146
Said that she had always feared
a call like this about her son.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.848
She was gonna collect

30:50.850 --> 30:52.883
A dna exemplar from home
and drive it up,

30:52.885 --> 30:56.587
Confirm I.D.
She never showed.

30:56.589 --> 31:00.457
So that's why dawn banks was
taking a dna sample of tyler.

31:00.459 --> 31:02.092
He wasn't her suspect.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.628
She thought he was dead.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.330
Russell:
<i>Henry ran tyler's dna</i>

31:06.332 --> 31:08.398
Against the rapist.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.267
He's clear.
Apparently,
tyler lent

31:10.269 --> 31:12.569
His I.D. To a buddy of his,
a homeless guy

31:12.571 --> 31:14.104
Who was heading up to reno.

31:14.106 --> 31:18.141
So his buddy o.D.'s,
decomposes beyond recognition,

31:18.143 --> 31:20.878
Cops go off the I.D.
In his pocket.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.879
All right.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.013
So, let's run this.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.616
You get the call
that your son is dead,

31:25.618 --> 31:27.985
And you pick up
a piece of his laundry

31:27.987 --> 31:30.520
For dna so you
can I.D. Him.
You start driving

31:30.522 --> 31:33.357
Up to reno where the body is.
Right. Except...

31:33.359 --> 31:35.292
The road that her car

31:35.294 --> 31:37.895
Ends up on is not
on the way to reno.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.663
I found a receipt

31:39.665 --> 31:42.633
In dawn's car from a truck stop,

31:42.635 --> 31:44.635
And the truck stop...

31:44.637 --> 31:46.303
Is at the junction

31:46.305 --> 31:48.639
Of 95 and 373.

31:48.641 --> 31:52.209
That's when she started
driving south, away from reno.

31:52.211 --> 31:55.679
Is where she changed her mind,
and her route.

31:55.681 --> 31:59.016
The question is:
Where was she going?

32:01.119 --> 32:02.986
Tyler,

32:02.988 --> 32:05.222
I need to ask you a question.
Is there, um,

32:05.224 --> 32:07.391
Any place off
of highway 373 that

32:07.393 --> 32:08.992
May have meant
something to your mom?

32:08.994 --> 32:11.128
Why?

32:14.399 --> 32:16.233
Your mom thought
you were dead.

32:16.235 --> 32:19.603
Your I.D. Was on a young
man who overdosed in reno.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.605
She was driving out
to identify your body,

32:21.607 --> 32:24.241
And, for some reason,
she changed her mind.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.144
She stopped at a
truck stop, and, uh...

32:27.146 --> 32:28.412
We pulled
the surveillance footage.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.080
It looks like she bought...

32:30.082 --> 32:32.482
Vodka and acetaminophen.

32:32.484 --> 32:34.217
S-so she's...
No, no, listen.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.219
W-we don't know that,
but we think that maybe,

32:36.221 --> 32:38.221
If she was going to do
something to herself,

32:38.223 --> 32:41.158
She might have chosen a place
that was significant.

32:43.161 --> 32:45.329
She used to take me camping
out there.

32:45.331 --> 32:47.097
But, I mean,
I-it was forever ago.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.166
Okay, show me.
Show me where.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.539
Good boy.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.108
This favorite spot
tyler told you about,

32:58.110 --> 32:59.543
Are you sure it's this way?

32:59.545 --> 33:03.246
But he and his mom haven't
been here in several years.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.282
He was a little hazy.
Well, if dawn's up here,

33:05.284 --> 33:06.984
How many hours has it been?
(dog barking)

33:06.986 --> 33:09.753
Over there. Come on.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.123
(dog sniffing)

33:15.293 --> 33:16.660
(gasps)
dawn.

33:21.233 --> 33:25.035
Control, this is
adam-zero-four yeager.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.503
We have csi banks. North trail,

33:26.505 --> 33:28.305
About a half-mile in.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.706
Send medics. Code three.

33:29.708 --> 33:32.609
Dawn? Come on.

33:32.611 --> 33:33.643
(sighs)
dawn,

33:33.645 --> 33:34.745
Wake up, please.

33:34.747 --> 33:36.213
Tyler is alive.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.115
He's okay. Come on.
Stay with us, dawn.

33:38.117 --> 33:42.352
Dawn, help's on the way.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.723
Hey, boss. Got your text.
How's csi banks?

33:46.725 --> 33:49.393
Oh, she's in icu.
Morgan's with her.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.094
Good. Uh, what's up?

33:51.096 --> 33:53.030
We still have
a serial rapist out there

33:53.032 --> 33:55.432
With some kind of connection
to that trailer park.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.168
Want you to grab
henry, go out there

33:58.170 --> 34:00.203
And go through all the
trash cans you can find.

34:00.205 --> 34:01.772
If you come up with
any biologicals,

34:01.774 --> 34:03.206
Run them against
our rapist's dna.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.142
We need to find
out if he's still

34:05.144 --> 34:06.343
In one of those
trailers.

34:06.345 --> 34:09.112
All right, I'm on it.
Thank you.

34:23.194 --> 34:25.128
Doing noble work here, ma'am.

34:26.130 --> 34:28.065
Hodges?

34:28.067 --> 34:30.267
Check this out.

34:33.604 --> 34:35.605
So they got

34:35.607 --> 34:39.476
Top-of-the-line locks,
security cam. They're treating

34:39.478 --> 34:41.344
A dinged-up trailer
like it's fort knox.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.380
Paranoid,
or protecting something?

34:50.621 --> 34:52.789
Couple of wadded-up tissues.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.591
Ooh.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.427
I know what I'm
running first.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.609
Dna matches our rapist.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.678
We've got him.

35:16.747 --> 35:19.249
Lvpd!

35:24.288 --> 35:25.555
All clear.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.624
Come on, henry.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.262
(camera shutter clicks)

35:32.264 --> 35:34.264
Surveillance cam's
not hooked up.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.633
It's just for show.

35:40.338 --> 35:42.672
Young brunettes.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.674
Just like amy
and the other victims.

35:44.676 --> 35:48.378
Andrews:
I got pics of amy
with jared wallace, and, uh,

35:48.380 --> 35:50.814
Other mementos.

35:53.651 --> 35:56.553
"jared, I hope
what we have

35:56.555 --> 35:58.555
Will last forever. Amy."

35:58.557 --> 36:01.291
Certainly lasted in his mind.

36:03.661 --> 36:05.929
Guy rents this trailer
to obsess

36:05.931 --> 36:08.899
And prepare
in private.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.634
Becomes his base

36:10.636 --> 36:13.670
When he starts to act out
on his obsession.

36:14.705 --> 36:16.706
Did some acting here, too.

36:16.708 --> 36:18.341
I'll swab.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.221
Heart medication.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.623
Andrews:
Swiped daddy's prescription.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.298
A gray hair.

36:47.838 --> 36:50.473
It's not jared.

36:53.444 --> 36:55.979
It's dad.

36:55.981 --> 36:59.683
Brass:
I guess I can
understand, mr. Wallace.

36:59.685 --> 37:02.419
This whole event started
innocently at first.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.621
You know, son brings home
his girlfriend to meet dad.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.755
She's attractive.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.924
Dad likes her.
He notices her.

37:07.926 --> 37:10.427
He liked having amy
around, so he invites her

37:10.429 --> 37:12.896
To family picnics, outings,

37:12.898 --> 37:15.565
But then things
get weird.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.534
Dad gets kind of
jealous of son.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.502
Right? You also
took from him, too.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.571
You took his jacket,
his love letters.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.573
And you took from amy, too.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.310
You know, we asked amy
about you.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.813
What did she say?

37:29.815 --> 37:31.815
She said,

37:31.817 --> 37:35.785
"ken wallace walked in on me
once or twice in the shower,

37:35.787 --> 37:37.821
"but it was
innocent.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.790
"he was sweet,
clumsy, older man.

37:40.792 --> 37:43.526
Nothing sexual about him."

37:43.528 --> 37:46.963
So you had to
change that, so,

37:46.965 --> 37:48.999
When amy broke up with jared,
about a week later,

37:49.001 --> 37:51.301
You know, and you're gonna
lose her, too, you decided

37:51.303 --> 37:52.535
To do something
about it.

37:52.537 --> 37:54.804
Get a funky old
trailer, hired some

37:54.806 --> 37:56.439
Brunette hookers.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.742
Got their dna from the sheets.

37:58.744 --> 38:02.312
But you stepped
over the line.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.749
You started to prowl
around condos just like amy's.

38:05.751 --> 38:09.286
Started to stalk young women,
brunettes, just like amy.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.720
You broke into their house.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.555
You broke into
their bedroom

38:12.557 --> 38:15.659
To act out your
sick rape fantasies,

38:15.661 --> 38:18.995
All in preparation...

38:18.997 --> 38:21.064
For amy.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.068
Amy was worth it.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.907
The woman... Is a miracle.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.711
Jared had her, he messed it up.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.016
When I had my chance with her...

38:40.018 --> 38:42.952
I made it perfect.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.027
(indistinct voice over p.A.)

38:59.837 --> 39:03.807
Doctors say your mom's
gonna pull through.

39:03.809 --> 39:07.477
I never wanted to hurt her.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.479
I know.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.414
Or make it easy
for her to believe

39:11.416 --> 39:12.682
I'd end up dead that way.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.894
You know, I-I just keep thinking

39:24.896 --> 39:27.897
About how cold
she was out there.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.367
You know,
I could've told her,

39:30.369 --> 39:33.670
Sleeping outside sucks.

39:38.008 --> 39:41.444
She's going to need you,
tyler, more than ever.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.716
I swear to god,

39:46.718 --> 39:50.453
I'm not leaving the house
for a second.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.555
I'm done...

39:52.557 --> 39:55.158
With everything,
everyone else.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.661
Just let her be okay.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.663
(crying)

40:00.665 --> 40:04.534
Please let her be okay.

40:04.536 --> 40:08.605
(crying)
