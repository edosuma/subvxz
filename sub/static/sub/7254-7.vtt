WEBVTT

00:00.527 --> 00:02.005
Previously on
"Gilmore girls"...

00:02.016 --> 00:04.056
Here. This came a
couple of days ago.

00:04.066 --> 00:05.507
It's from Sherry.

00:05.917 --> 00:07.056
From Sherry?

00:07.066 --> 00:09.783
Yeah, it's the first I've heard from
her since the divorce was final.

00:09.813 --> 00:11.230
I'm here for the paper.
I'm Rory.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.304
Okay, you got to let us show
you around the rest of the show.

00:13.334 --> 00:14.107
That's cool.

00:14.117 --> 00:16.978
Come on, we'll help you with your
article, give you the skinny on everyone.

00:17.007 --> 00:18.730
I spoke with Sherry
this morning.

00:18.743 --> 00:19.641
What's the deal with her?

00:19.677 --> 00:21.393
She wants me to send G.G.
to Paris

00:21.409 --> 00:23.062
to stay with her
for two months.

00:23.079 --> 00:26.633
I know we're friends,
and I'm glad, but...

00:26.966 --> 00:29.082
I don't want to be
just friends anymore.

00:29.096 --> 00:31.052
I like... Logan.

00:31.066 --> 00:32.720
Come to Paris with me.

00:32.778 --> 00:34.320
- What?
- You were right.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.931
I should take G.G. myself.
I should check everything out.

00:37.846 --> 00:40.530
Okay, sweetie, what do we say to
mommy when we see her at the airport?

00:40.568 --> 00:41.461
Bonjour!

00:41.476 --> 00:43.262
"Bonjour, mama!
What's the haps?"

00:43.275 --> 00:45.241
I don't know the french
word for "haps." Passports?

00:45.275 --> 00:47.363
Got 'em. But sweetie,
even after we meet up with mommy,

00:47.395 --> 00:49.163
we're gonna stay with
you all day, okay?

00:49.178 --> 00:51.091
All day. You will not 
be able to shake us. Cash?

00:51.097 --> 00:51.862
Check.

00:51.876 --> 00:53.623
- Confusing shorthand.
- Check -- I've got cash.

00:53.656 --> 00:54.253
Thank you.

00:54.268 --> 00:55.863
Will there be food
on the plane?

00:55.877 --> 00:57.413
There will be food,

00:57.426 --> 01:00.193
but airplane food is one
of life's cruel jokes,

01:00.208 --> 01:02.923
so, just in case,
we have snacks up the wazoo.

01:02.936 --> 01:05.750
Are you sure the departure's 3:30?
Why did I think it was later?

01:05.768 --> 01:07.092
3:30-ish.

01:07.106 --> 01:09.222
That's what it says on the ticket?
"Departure 3:30-ish"?

01:09.256 --> 01:11.593
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Traffic this time of day's impossible.

01:11.628 --> 01:12.951
All right, honey. Let's go.

01:12.966 --> 01:16.153
You choose a trip to France
to start using free weights?

01:16.165 --> 01:18.150
Those are my shoes--
of course it's heavy.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.450
You teach them and teach them,

01:19.466 --> 01:22.000
but they never learn,
do they, G.G.?

01:22.216 --> 01:25.570
Why do I feel like the
departure was 6:15?

01:25.587 --> 01:26.800
Let's go.

01:26.815 --> 01:29.411
Now, G.G.,
you are gonna love Paris.

01:29.428 --> 01:31.320
You know,
they call it "the city of love."

01:31.338 --> 01:33.071
- Why?
- Why?

01:33.087 --> 01:34.851
Well, because it's romantic,

01:34.868 --> 01:37.650
and there's just
love everywhere.

01:37.888 --> 01:40.193
Of course,
there's also pigeons everywhere,

01:40.207 --> 01:43.043
but nobody would want to visit
the city of pigeons, would they?

01:43.055 --> 01:44.200
I think we're ready.

01:44.215 --> 01:47.530
Are you gonna tell me what time
this flight actually leaves?

01:47.545 --> 01:48.781
Soon.

01:49.157 --> 01:52.132
Your daddy is very vague, G.G.

01:52.145 --> 01:53.890
How cool is it that
we're going to France?

01:53.905 --> 01:55.930
You're going to have such a
good time staying in Paris.

01:55.965 --> 01:58.060
I am green with envy.
Am I green?

01:58.075 --> 02:00.212
- It's more of a teal.
- It goes great with my eyes.

02:00.228 --> 02:02.622
Driver, take us to France!
Au revoir, house!

02:02.636 --> 02:04.092
Au revoir, house!

02:04.107 --> 02:06.211
We're pretty low on gas.
Gonna have to stop and get some.

02:06.246 --> 02:07.750
Honey, how do we have time
to stop for gas?

02:07.766 --> 02:09.800
Our flight's not
for 3 1/2 hours.

02:11.635 --> 02:13.651
We knew it, G.G., didn't we?

02:13.665 --> 02:15.520
G.G. and I knew it.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074

03:10.577 --> 03:13.650
So, as your newly
elected editor in chief,

03:13.668 --> 03:15.961
it is my great honor to...

03:16.198 --> 03:19.090
- honor... the stepping down...
- Okay.

03:19.106 --> 03:20.731
- "Stepping down."
- Eloquent.

03:20.747 --> 03:22.053
...of our former leader.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.811
Anyone else thinking "recall"?

03:24.228 --> 03:26.303
That's okay, Bill. Keep going.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.441
As I was saying, in recognition

03:28.458 --> 03:31.230
of Rory's hard work and
devotion to the Daily News,

03:31.245 --> 03:33.373
we have a few tokens
of our appreciation.

03:33.387 --> 03:34.193
A.K.?

03:34.206 --> 03:36.132
This is just something
to hang on your wall

03:36.145 --> 03:38.333
when  you become editor
of the New York Times.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.400
Oh, thank you.

03:39.417 --> 03:41.592
It's the front page of the
last edition you edited.

03:41.606 --> 03:43.423
Yeah, she needed
that explained.

03:43.795 --> 03:47.350
Rory... this is to commemorate
all those articles of ours

03:47.366 --> 03:49.483
that you
carefully, thoughtfully

03:49.495 --> 03:51.072
ripped to shreds.

03:51.185 --> 03:53.280
Thank you, Rob.
Now I think I have to go out

03:53.295 --> 03:55.732
and buy a freakishly
large pencil sharpener.

03:55.758 --> 03:57.563
I have a confession to make.

03:57.575 --> 04:01.823
I only joined the Yale Daily
News as a way to meet cute guys,

04:01.836 --> 04:05.250
but after watching you handle the
job of editor with intelligence

04:05.268 --> 04:07.301
and... and grace...

04:07.317 --> 04:10.032
I became inspired to
become a journalist.

04:10.045 --> 04:11.393
Thank you.

04:11.917 --> 04:15.551
Whoa, Joni,
I'm touched and a little damp.

04:15.776 --> 04:17.172
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

04:17.185 --> 04:18.810
I have a Rory story.

04:19.047 --> 04:21.390
When I was running the paper,
I was dying to do an article

04:21.406 --> 04:24.331
about everybody's asinine
obsession with Boho Chic,

04:24.345 --> 04:26.100
but Rory had the
guts to tell me

04:26.116 --> 04:28.602
that the idea for my
article was trite and passÃ©,

04:28.618 --> 04:30.071
because that's who Rory is --

04:30.088 --> 04:32.562
honest, direct,
and to the point.

04:32.578 --> 04:34.350
Like, when you all turned on me

04:34.366 --> 04:36.562
and decided you didn't
want me in charge anymore,

04:36.575 --> 04:38.853
and you all chewed me
up and spit me out,

04:38.867 --> 04:41.382
Rory was the one who
broke the news to me.

04:41.395 --> 04:42.781
Thank you, Rory,

04:42.798 --> 04:44.513
for being the one
person with integrity

04:44.526 --> 04:47.512
among a collection
of cowardly back servers.

04:51.816 --> 04:54.092
These are all such
great stories.

04:54.106 --> 04:56.462
- To Rory.
- To Rory!

04:56.475 --> 04:58.201
Thank you very much.

04:58.218 --> 05:00.150
I didn't write a
speech or anything,

05:00.166 --> 05:02.570
although I could recite "The
Charge of the Light Brigade,"

05:02.585 --> 05:04.830
or the lyrics to
"Rebel Rebel"...

05:04.847 --> 05:05.950
Let's hear it.

05:05.965 --> 05:09.001
...neither of which I think
are appropriate, but, um...

05:09.015 --> 05:12.242
Look, I've really
enjoyed being editor.

05:12.255 --> 05:14.671
It's been great.

05:14.806 --> 05:17.860
But it's time for
a change, right?

05:17.888 --> 05:22.021
So sayeth the Yale 
Daily News bylaws.

05:22.037 --> 05:24.580
Um, so...

05:25.305 --> 05:26.833
ladies and gentlemen,

05:26.847 --> 05:29.850
I give you your new
editor in chief --

05:29.965 --> 05:31.323
what's your name again?

05:31.337 --> 05:32.860
Ha ha.

05:32.878 --> 05:34.881
Anyway,  my first editorial move

05:34.896 --> 05:36.921
is to take everyone
to Rich Man's Shoe.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.010
Drinks on me.

05:38.027 --> 05:40.120
All right,
that's what I'm talking about!

05:40.165 --> 05:42.871
All  right! All right!

05:43.996 --> 05:44.963
Coming?

05:44.976 --> 05:46.267
- Huh?
- For drinks?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.401
Uh, no. I think I'm gonna pass.

05:48.417 --> 05:49.472
How come?

05:49.488 --> 05:51.640
Um, well, new editor,
new regime --

05:51.657 --> 05:53.881
I don't want it to seem like I'm
still trying to be your boss.

05:53.916 --> 05:56.750
Yeah, no one likes someone hanging
around, telling us how to get drunk.

05:56.765 --> 05:57.750
You know what I mean.

05:57.766 --> 05:58.831
Yeah.

05:58.845 --> 06:00.613
- See you around.
- You too.

06:00.625 --> 06:02.980
Well, now we're both
ousted leaders.

06:02.997 --> 06:04.920
Welcome to club Nixon.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.611
Twins, Zach.
We're having twins.

06:15.627 --> 06:17.603
Yeah, it's heavy,
but we can handle it.

06:17.619 --> 06:20.102
Twice as many mouths to feed,
twice as much to clean up after...

06:20.139 --> 06:22.191
Yeah, all that --
plus, there's gonna be prejudice,

06:22.208 --> 06:23.953
- but we can fight that.
- What?

06:23.967 --> 06:25.182
And they have
surgeries now, babe.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.853
- This does not have to be permanent.
- What doesn't?

06:26.885 --> 06:29.751
As long as the babies don't have some vital 
organ attached, they can be separated--

06:29.787 --> 06:31.283
- easy-breezy.
- What are you talking about?

06:31.318 --> 06:34.032
Until the operation,
we'll just get specially made clothes.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.551
Unless they're attached at the head.
Then they can wear just about anything.

06:36.588 --> 06:38.253
I mean,
we just slip it on from the feet up --

06:38.286 --> 06:41.441
Zach, we're having twins,
not siamese twins.

06:45.946 --> 06:49.173
Dude, that is such
a load off my mind!

06:49.188 --> 06:51.942
So than why were you freaking
out at the doctor's office?

06:51.956 --> 06:53.411
Because we're having twins!

06:53.427 --> 06:55.642
Yeah, but they're separate.
It's, like, way easier.

06:55.655 --> 06:58.010
Easier than what?
Triplets? Siamese triplets?

06:58.025 --> 07:01.500
Yeah, Zach, twins is way
easier than siamese triplets.

07:03.426 --> 07:06.672
I think we kind of have to tell
your mother you're pregnant now.

07:07.196 --> 07:09.273
Ugh... she is so
going to kill me!

07:09.288 --> 07:11.913
- I mean, you're starting to show.
- Of course I'm starting to show!

07:11.948 --> 07:13.903
My body's filling up
with two growing people!

07:13.916 --> 07:15.621
She is so gonna think we
had sex before the wedding,

07:15.655 --> 07:16.791
and she'll convince me we did.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.130
But we didn't.
Believe me. I'd remember.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.662
You don't understand.
This is what she does to me.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.572
She gives me this look, and I get
all panicky and start sweating.

07:24.586 --> 07:26.383
Once, at a church picnic,
someone had taken a bite

07:26.416 --> 07:28.562
out of six deviled eggs and
put them back on the platter.

07:28.597 --> 07:31.810
My mother accused me of doing it,
and I almost confessed!

07:31.826 --> 07:34.150
- But you hate deviled eggs.
- That's the point!

07:34.165 --> 07:36.030
After she gave me that look,
I wasn't sure.

07:36.047 --> 07:37.511
Maybe I had taken those bites.

07:37.525 --> 07:40.171
She gets in my head.
It's like korean voodoo.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.581
It's gonna be okay. It is.

07:43.598 --> 07:46.420
Whoa... you know what
this picture is?

07:46.436 --> 07:48.133
Our first album cover.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.233
Zach...

07:49.246 --> 07:51.760
Yeah, it's like a
prenatal "Nevermind."

08:06.976 --> 08:08.682
Merci...

08:09.008 --> 08:11.920
monsieur... bellhop. Jeesh.

08:11.935 --> 08:15.421
Did you see that? He literally
sniffed at my tip and sauntered off.

08:15.435 --> 08:18.103
Yeah, he sniffed and sauntered.
He did not hop.

08:18.116 --> 08:20.542
The bellhop was a gem
compared to the concierge.

08:20.558 --> 08:22.662
Isn't it his job to be polite?

08:22.677 --> 08:24.400
You would think the
concierge would be polite.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.291
It's not like we're being
obnoxious and asking someone

08:26.326 --> 08:28.490
to take a picture of us in
front of Jim Morrison's grave.

08:28.528 --> 08:30.590
Which, by the way,
I promised Rory we would do.

08:30.606 --> 08:33.010
I hope G.G. picks up 
the language and the customs,

08:33.025 --> 08:34.433
but none of the rudeness.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.191
Oh, no, G.G.'s too sweet.

08:37.205 --> 08:39.611
She's got an impenetrable
coat of sweetness around her.

08:39.625 --> 08:41.663
You shouldn't have called her G.G.,
you should've called her M&M's.

08:41.696 --> 08:43.201
You were great with
her the whole flight.

08:43.236 --> 08:45.800
You were also great 
with Sherry today. Thank you.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.170
She was great with me.

08:47.185 --> 08:49.640
So, it's not just me, right?
She does seem to have it together?

08:49.675 --> 08:52.121
Yeah, she seems
grounded and sincere.

08:52.135 --> 08:54.511
She was nice. I couldn't believe
how prepared for G.G. she was.

08:54.545 --> 08:56.813
She was.
She had her favorite "Madeline" book.

08:56.827 --> 08:58.093
She knew where the
nearest park was.

08:58.125 --> 09:00.121
And did you see?
She already had a booster seat.

09:00.137 --> 09:02.302
Very  impressive. But by the time 
I got Rory one of those,

09:02.338 --> 09:05.112
she was 60 pounds.
It got stuck on her butt.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.762
Oh, my god.

09:08.775 --> 09:10.782
- What?
- We're in Paris!

09:10.798 --> 09:12.320
You were thinking
it was Phoenix?

09:12.337 --> 09:14.123
I just wasn't
thinking anything.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.250
I mean, I was focused on getting G.G.
all settled in.

09:17.268 --> 09:21.381
It slipped my mind that we're in the
most beautiful city in the world!

09:21.398 --> 09:22.631
The Phoenix of Europe.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.180
First we have to go to Harry's
bar and smoke gauloises cigarettes

09:25.215 --> 09:28.150
and get in a fight about
cubism and gesticulate wildly.

09:28.165 --> 09:30.421
I am going to call our
friend the concierge

09:30.435 --> 09:34.451
and make a reservation at the most
romantic restaurant in Paris.

09:34.465 --> 09:38.521
Ask him why these beds are
so insanely comfortable.

09:38.538 --> 09:40.742
Yes, can I -- No, no, no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey!

09:40.756 --> 09:43.883
No sleeping. We are in Paris now.
We are on Paris time.

09:43.896 --> 09:46.040
- Fight the jet lag.
- Fighting the jet lag.

09:46.055 --> 09:47.501
Jet lag strong.

09:47.518 --> 09:52.852
Yes, I'm sorry, sir. Could I make
a 8:30 reservation at L'ArpÃ¨ge?

09:54.985 --> 09:56.301
Yes...

09:56.637 --> 09:58.960
Uh-huh, I-I understand.

09:58.978 --> 10:00.360
Thank you.

10:00.906 --> 10:02.280
Did he book it?

10:02.296 --> 10:05.360
He did. He also 
reminded us to wear shoes.

10:05.377 --> 10:07.581
I sense he has a very
low opinion of americans.

10:07.595 --> 10:08.921
Well, the french might be rude,

10:08.938 --> 10:12.280
but they know how to
make a very cozy bed.

10:12.305 --> 10:13.491
- Lorelai?
- What?

10:13.506 --> 10:15.263
- I know you're tired.
- A tad.

10:15.278 --> 10:17.630
I know you've been awake for
something like 30 hours...

10:17.646 --> 10:18.681
32 1/2.

10:18.698 --> 10:21.022
...just to help me make the
transition easier for G.G.,

10:21.037 --> 10:22.533
and I really appreciate it.

10:22.547 --> 10:24.153
Aww, don't mention it.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.852
And I just want to show
you the best possible time

10:26.865 --> 10:29.693
that you can have in Paris
because you deserve it.

10:29.707 --> 10:32.553
Aww, you're sweet.

10:32.587 --> 10:35.682
- Lorelai... Lorelai! Lorelai!
- Okay, all right.

10:35.698 --> 10:37.622
Yes, we're gonna get up,
'cause we're in Paris,

10:37.635 --> 10:39.362
and we're gonna have
a great parisian time.

10:39.378 --> 10:40.532
- We are!
- Yes!

10:40.546 --> 10:42.592
Hey, is the Tour de
France still going on?

10:42.608 --> 10:44.222
'Cause we could stand on
a little Paris street

10:44.258 --> 10:45.953
and yell "whoo-hoo"
when the guys go by,

10:45.968 --> 10:48.983
or I could pour a cup of water on
one of them as he goes whooping by.

10:48.998 --> 10:51.182
Actually, the Tour de France
was a couple of months ago.

10:51.215 --> 10:53.721
But we are going to a beautiful,
intimate restaurant,

10:53.737 --> 10:56.353
and after we finish our meal,
you can throw water on me.

10:56.366 --> 10:57.822
Whoo-hoo!

11:00.228 --> 11:01.483
What are you doing right now?

11:01.495 --> 11:02.253
Not much.

11:02.265 --> 11:04.460
Would you mind swinging by
the library to drop these off?

11:04.495 --> 11:07.021
I'd do it, but I just got
cornered by professor Edwards.

11:07.035 --> 11:08.680
She wants to meet for
coffee in five minutes

11:08.716 --> 11:11.163
to discuss me being her T.A.
second semester.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.482
I got to start thinking
about life after graduation.

11:13.496 --> 11:15.981
Cozying up to professor Edwards 
could be a fast pass to a fellowship.

11:16.018 --> 11:16.991
I guess that's true.

11:17.008 --> 11:18.232
- What about you?
- What about me?

11:18.268 --> 11:20.650
You looking into any fellowships?
Scholarships? Grad schools?

11:20.687 --> 11:22.450
Not really. I mean, not yet.

11:22.465 --> 11:24.072
I will, probably.

11:24.085 --> 11:27.710
Time's running out. They only give
the Lsat one more time before spring.

11:27.727 --> 11:29.401
Anyway, thanks for
dropping off the books.

11:29.407 --> 11:30.950
I don't mean to make
you run out of your way.

11:30.988 --> 11:32.573
I  just thought you have a lot of
free time since you don't work

11:32.607 --> 11:34.181
- at the paper anymore.
- That is true.

11:34.197 --> 11:35.291
What are you taking,
by the way?

11:35.325 --> 11:36.113
Taking?

11:36.207 --> 11:37.822
Just remember,
tricyclic antidepressants

11:37.836 --> 11:40.033
are better than your
monoamine oxidase inhibitors,

11:40.048 --> 11:41.602
since those are
for panic attacks.

11:41.618 --> 11:42.780
It doesn't look like
you're there yet.

11:42.815 --> 11:44.162
I have no plans of going there.

11:44.177 --> 11:44.922
You will.

11:44.935 --> 11:47.740
I know when I was finished as editor,
I went into a major tailspin.

11:47.757 --> 11:48.581
Can you tell ?

11:48.597 --> 11:51.821
You masked it so well with your
generally gloomy disposition.

11:51.838 --> 11:54.062
The first day is hard.
Then it just gets worse.

11:54.075 --> 11:56.003
As it happens,
I am totally relieved

11:56.017 --> 11:57.352
that my job at
the paper is over.

11:57.365 --> 11:59.251
Yeah, I did the
denial thing, too.

11:59.266 --> 12:02.322
I even tried smiling a lot. That got
old, and I think it made this line.

12:02.336 --> 12:03.531
That'll teach you to smile.

12:03.545 --> 12:05.710
You know, you really shouldn't
be alone at a time like this.

12:05.746 --> 12:07.493
Why don't you call your
"girls gone wild" friends?

12:07.526 --> 12:10.032
They seem delightful in a
"get crazy-drunk in Cancun

12:10.046 --> 12:11.361
and flash your
breasts" kind of way.

12:11.395 --> 12:13.682
Your take on Lucy and
Olivia is so not them.

12:13.696 --> 12:15.240
Whatever. Later.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.922
Oh, and Lexapro is fast-acting,
but side effects

12:17.937 --> 12:20.543
are weight gain and noticeable
drop in sexual appetite.

12:20.558 --> 12:23.052
Of course, with Logan gone,
that's moot.

12:23.065 --> 12:25.220
Always a pleasure, Paris.

12:43.626 --> 12:44.892
How's the maeun-tang?

12:44.908 --> 12:46.322
- Good!
- Yeah!

12:46.336 --> 12:48.281
Really good maeun-tang.

12:54.075 --> 12:55.501
How was work?

12:55.516 --> 12:57.733
- Oh, yeah, my work is good.
- My work is good.

12:57.837 --> 12:59.451
That's good.

13:09.065 --> 13:10.961
This is great dinner, mama.

13:11.037 --> 13:12.291
I'm glad you like it.

13:12.306 --> 13:14.713
It's been too long since
we had dinner together.

13:14.725 --> 13:16.373
Way too long.

13:18.327 --> 13:20.741
I think you've been avoiding me,
and I know why.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.490
- We haven't been avoiding --
- Do not try to fool me.

13:22.527 --> 13:24.122
I know what's going on.

13:28.207 --> 13:31.710
You have no new music to show me,
and you are ashamed.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.212
- Music?
- Yes, music --

13:33.227 --> 13:34.943
the thing you say you
want to do for a living.

13:34.976 --> 13:37.202
Oh, no, I do!
Yeah, I've been working on some stuff.

13:37.215 --> 13:38.271
What kind of stuff?

13:38.286 --> 13:40.302
Actually, I've been experimenting
with different instruments.

13:40.338 --> 13:42.583
Like, I've been playing electric
mandolin, which sound really--

13:42.618 --> 13:44.120
Mom, I'm pregnant!

13:45.535 --> 13:47.702
We waited until after we were married!
If you don't believe us,

13:47.738 --> 13:49.730
we have a note from our doctor,

13:49.746 --> 13:51.492
which doesn't prove anything,
but it does!

13:51.507 --> 13:52.791
- Hit me! Hit me!
- Firmly established --

13:52.825 --> 13:55.313
- It's my fault! Hit me!
- It happened during the --

13:56.288 --> 13:59.472
A new child is a
great blessing.

13:59.878 --> 14:01.353
Really?

14:01.366 --> 14:04.013
Chuka hamnida, Lane and Zach.

14:04.025 --> 14:05.821
She says, "congratulations."

14:05.836 --> 14:06.822
Really?

14:06.837 --> 14:09.740
Then you should say
"chuka hamnida hamnida"

14:09.755 --> 14:11.671
Because we're having twins.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.643
- Twins?
- Twins.

14:13.657 --> 14:15.920
Oh, that's wonderful.

14:16.607 --> 14:19.722
So, monday,
you move in with me.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.050
Cool.

14:24.447 --> 14:27.602
I must go e-mail this good news
to our relatives in Pusan.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.333
They just got wi-fi.

14:31.555 --> 14:33.091
"Cool"?!

14:42.617 --> 14:46.231
No! Oh, no, no, no! No, no, no!

14:46.246 --> 14:48.093
- What? What?
- Honey, get up! Get up!

14:48.106 --> 14:49.412
I'm up! I'm up! I'm up! I'm up!

14:49.427 --> 14:51.823
What? We got to go, right?
I-I got to shave?

14:51.837 --> 14:53.901
No, not unless
you're a werewolf!

14:53.915 --> 14:54.983
What?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.270
It's the middle of the night!

14:56.285 --> 14:57.771
- What?
- It's 4:00!

14:57.785 --> 14:59.792
- What's 4:00?
- That. It.

14:59.807 --> 15:01.851
- It's 4:00?
- Yes! It's 4:00!

15:01.867 --> 15:04.900
We fell asleep! Damn the french
and their comfortable beds!

15:04.915 --> 15:07.553
Oh, we must've dozed
off around 7:00.

15:07.565 --> 15:09.480
We just had ourselves
a 9-hour nap.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.333
Nine hours?! That's not a nap.

15:11.348 --> 15:12.990
That's a coma.

15:13.278 --> 15:15.272
Wow, the city looks
really beautiful...

15:15.286 --> 15:16.772
and dead.

15:16.785 --> 15:20.891
Ugh, okay -- this place is very
tastefully decorated and everything,

15:20.905 --> 15:23.252
but would it kill them to
put a minibar in here?

15:23.265 --> 15:25.182
- I'm starving.
- Me too.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.680
You don't think they're still holding
our table at L'ArpÃ¨ge, do you?

15:28.695 --> 15:31.320
I'm guessing our table at
L'ArpÃ¨ge smells of disinfectant

15:31.337 --> 15:33.430
and has two chairs
on top of it.

15:34.315 --> 15:37.170
It's okay, it's okay!
I can fix this!

15:37.187 --> 15:39.792
Room service!
What are you in the mood for?

15:39.805 --> 15:44.322
Um... I would like a cheeseburger
with a side of cheeseburger,

15:44.335 --> 15:47.310
and see if they can make me
a cheeseburger smoothie.

15:47.328 --> 15:49.710
Well, if they can make goose
innards into a tasty spread,

15:49.727 --> 15:52.070
I'm sure they can make
a cheeseburger smoothie.

15:52.087 --> 15:53.373
Yes, sir, hi.

15:53.388 --> 15:55.812
I would like to order
some room service.

15:58.986 --> 16:00.312
What'd he say?

16:00.328 --> 16:03.001
He didn't say,
so much as chortle.

16:03.016 --> 16:05.432
No room service?
And no minibar?

16:05.445 --> 16:07.693
But two toilets.
Where are their priorities?

16:07.707 --> 16:09.733
Okay, let me float
another plan.

16:09.745 --> 16:11.753
Don't say "float" unless
"root beer" is attached to it.

16:11.787 --> 16:13.083
It's after 4:00.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.580
Why don't we get a
few more hours' sleep,

16:14.617 --> 16:17.312
we wake up early,
feast on a delicious french breakfast,

16:17.325 --> 16:19.731
and then we hit Paris
totally refreshed.

16:19.747 --> 16:21.450
Oh, fine...

16:21.467 --> 16:24.563
Crummy Europe. 
Crummy time change.

16:24.577 --> 16:25.920
We switched to the
metric system --

16:25.958 --> 16:27.543
why don't they switch
to our time zone?

16:27.558 --> 16:29.711
- We didn't actually switch --
- I know!

16:49.975 --> 16:51.332
Never been so wide awake.

16:51.346 --> 16:52.662
I'm more wide awake.

16:52.675 --> 16:54.053
So wide awake I could watch

16:54.068 --> 16:57.343
the Ken Burns documentary
of "Sod" and not drift off.

16:57.358 --> 17:00.010
There  are 104 fleur-de-lis
stencil on the ceiling --

17:00.026 --> 17:01.400
that's how wide awake I am.

17:01.415 --> 17:03.442
I tried humming Brahms'
"Lullaby" in my head,

17:03.456 --> 17:05.051
but it kept morphing
into "Purple Rain,"

17:05.055 --> 17:06.731
and "Purple Rain" made
me think of grapes,

17:06.808 --> 17:08.363
which made me think of grape jam,
which made me think

17:08.397 --> 17:10.380
of english muffins
slathered in grape jam.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.623
Hold it -- this is 
the greatest city in the world.

17:12.635 --> 17:14.272
There is a restaurant out there,
still open,

17:14.307 --> 17:16.672
with candles and soft
lighting and great food,

17:16.688 --> 17:18.431
and I'm gonna find it for you.

17:18.445 --> 17:19.612
My hero.

17:19.627 --> 17:22.089
Besides, just being out on the
Paris streets late at night --

17:22.105 --> 17:24.022
what could be more romantic?

17:24.596 --> 17:26.412
Being out on the Paris
streets late at night

17:26.425 --> 17:28.680
eating a big, fat cheeseburger.

17:44.337 --> 17:46.491
- Hello?
- Hey, it's Rory.

17:46.505 --> 17:47.901
Hey, what's going on?

17:47.918 --> 17:49.300
Not a lot. What's up with you?

17:49.315 --> 17:51.973
I'm sitting here making a
mobile for my sister's baby.

17:51.985 --> 17:53.433
But it's turning
out really good,

17:53.448 --> 17:56.073
so I might just keep it for myself
and give the baby a pair of socks.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.680
Or make her a mobile
out of socks.

17:57.698 --> 17:58.863
Oh, that's genius.

17:58.877 --> 17:59.900
What's Lucy doing?

17:59.917 --> 18:01.912
Watching "Real World: Denver."

18:01.928 --> 18:05.153
Lucy's eating it up with a fork and
spoon 'cause boyfriend's working,

18:05.168 --> 18:07.410
and you know how much
he hates reality TV.

18:07.425 --> 18:08.251
Does he?

18:08.266 --> 18:10.583
I keep forgetting --
you still haven't met boyfriend.

18:10.596 --> 18:12.712
Yeah, I'm beginning to
wonder if he really exists,

18:12.725 --> 18:14.791
or if he's just
Lucy's Snuffleupagus.

18:14.808 --> 18:16.010
Lucy, it's Rory!

18:16.025 --> 18:17.342
Hey! What's up, girl?

18:17.356 --> 18:18.213
Hey, Lucy!

18:18.225 --> 18:19.641
Rory says "hey."

18:19.735 --> 18:21.310
You guys feel like
doing something?

18:21.328 --> 18:22.500
We should go somewhere!

18:22.515 --> 18:23.831
Cool, where do you want to go?

18:23.845 --> 18:25.933
I want to go to the country,
I want to get off campus.

18:25.968 --> 18:27.522
It's the weekend.
Let's get out of here.

18:27.556 --> 18:29.861
I'd so love to go to,
like, a cabin in the woods.

18:29.878 --> 18:30.952
Or just a house.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.833
We could... go to my house.

18:32.848 --> 18:33.950
Yeah?

18:33.967 --> 18:37.081
I mean, it's in Stars Hollow.
It's this really small town,

18:37.098 --> 18:38.590
and there's not a lot to do...

18:38.608 --> 18:40.012
Oh, my god.
Does your house have a yard?

18:40.047 --> 18:40.970
And a porch?

18:40.988 --> 18:43.163
The house has a yard and
a porch with a swing,

18:43.177 --> 18:44.931
and the swing makes this
little creaking sound.

18:44.967 --> 18:46.722
That sounds so perfect.

18:46.735 --> 18:49.411
When we get there, I'm definitely
mixing up a batch of lemonade

18:49.425 --> 18:51.073
and flirting with Slim,
"The Hired Hand".

18:51.085 --> 18:53.591
Slim The Hired Hand is a hottie,
but he's missing a hand.

18:53.608 --> 18:54.463
Ironic, huh?

18:54.477 --> 18:55.493
Pick you up in a little bit?

18:55.527 --> 18:56.393
We'll be here.

18:56.405 --> 18:57.443
Bye.

19:10.285 --> 19:13.212
So, class,
the word for "closed" is...

19:13.227 --> 19:15.233
You know, after seeing this sign
in seven different restaurants,

19:15.268 --> 19:17.240
it's no longer informative--
It's just mocking.

19:17.258 --> 19:18.533
This place looks good, too.

19:18.547 --> 19:20.721
Even the sound of it -- FermÃ©.

19:20.736 --> 19:22.673
- Let's try around the corner.
- It has a mocking tone.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.321
"Ha ha,
fermÃ©." Do you hear that?

19:25.335 --> 19:28.083
I hear a woman who's delusional
with hunger. Come on.

19:28.095 --> 19:29.930
See, this is why french
people are so skinny --

19:29.966 --> 19:31.330
'cause they have no
late-night snacks.

19:31.367 --> 19:32.710
How do you explain
GÃ©rard Depardieu?

19:32.748 --> 19:36.190
Oh, that's obvious. GÃ©rard
Depardieu has hogged all the food.

19:38.297 --> 19:40.430
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. Oh, I saw that.

19:40.448 --> 19:41.400
Come on.

19:41.416 --> 19:43.163
What do you say?
You hit him high, I hit him low.

19:43.195 --> 19:44.623
Monsieur?!

19:44.638 --> 19:46.293
Wait-- attendez!

19:46.307 --> 19:48.160
We just want to know where
you got the sandwich!

19:48.197 --> 19:49.701
- Oh, look what you did!
- What?

19:49.716 --> 19:50.822
You charged him.

19:50.836 --> 19:52.562
Everyone knows you
don't charge a bear

19:52.578 --> 19:54.833
or a man with a sandwich.

19:56.948 --> 19:58.433
That's a lot of bread.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.242
What are the chances there's
a butter truck nearby?

20:01.948 --> 20:04.993
Uh, pardonne-moi. Bonsoir.

20:05.005 --> 20:07.721
- Nous avons, hungry, hungry...
- I got it. I got it.

20:09.436 --> 20:11.823
Funny americans, huh?

20:11.838 --> 20:14.213
Yeah, funny.
Hungry americans, huh?

20:14.226 --> 20:16.373
"Everybody loves Raymond."

20:16.575 --> 20:18.482
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

20:27.708 --> 20:29.841
Happy people, the french.

20:32.805 --> 20:34.171
What?

20:34.186 --> 20:35.982
Nothing. It's weird...

20:36.295 --> 20:38.222
it's just being this hungry
makes me think of this time

20:38.255 --> 20:40.001
when we were in 10th grade,
and, for some reason,

20:40.036 --> 20:42.581
I had to make up this
chemistry exam during lunch,

20:42.597 --> 20:45.312
and it went on and on and on forever,
and then finally,

20:45.325 --> 20:47.670
when I was done, I came out...

20:48.158 --> 20:50.373
and there you were,
waiting for me.

20:50.875 --> 20:54.092
And you took this slice of
pizza from the cafeteria

20:54.105 --> 20:56.901
out of your coat pocket,
and you gave it to me.

20:56.918 --> 20:59.232
Pepperoni -- I remember.

20:59.938 --> 21:02.833
Even then, you were so sweet.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.033
Head back to the hotel?

21:14.027 --> 21:16.431
You don't still have that
pizza anywhere, do you?

21:16.446 --> 21:18.712
- Different coat.
- Darn!

21:25.326 --> 21:27.362
Babe, could you
check on my order?

21:27.375 --> 21:29.882
Oh, I did. I asked Luke where it was,
and Luke said,

21:29.895 --> 21:31.492
"from now on,
if Zach wants to eat here,

21:31.508 --> 21:33.292
he has to stand on his head
in the middle of the diner

21:33.326 --> 21:34.573
and eat out of a rusty bucket."

21:34.588 --> 21:36.652
So I said, "cool!"

21:36.668 --> 21:38.581
I couldn't help it, Lane!
I was so relieved

21:38.598 --> 21:40.630
that your mother wasn't pissed
off about the pregnancy.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.542
"Cool" just came out,
like a happy vocal burp.

21:43.555 --> 21:45.570
Next time, cover your mouth!

21:45.586 --> 21:46.982
Jeez!

21:47.456 --> 21:49.010
Kirk, what are you doing?

21:49.025 --> 21:50.581
Trying to feel a kick.

21:50.596 --> 21:53.312
You're gonna feel a kick if you
don't get your hand off my stomach.

21:53.326 --> 21:56.222
So, I don't know if you've decided where
you're gonna drop this little load,

21:56.256 --> 21:59.102
but I highly recommend Woodbury
Memorial, where I was born.

21:59.115 --> 21:59.983
Good to know.

21:59.996 --> 22:02.041
The maternity suites
there are primo,

22:02.055 --> 22:05.541
and they let the mother hold the baby
post-delivery as long as she wants.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.193
Explains a lot about the relationship
between me and my mother.

22:08.207 --> 22:09.951
- Yes, it does.
- Kirk, go away

22:09.967 --> 22:12.341
and stop harassing
my employees.

22:12.357 --> 22:14.390
You should sit awhile.

22:14.406 --> 22:16.081
No, I'm fine!
Standing's no problem.

22:16.098 --> 22:19.003
All right, but from now on,
no more serving heavy food --

22:19.015 --> 22:21.701
your meat loaves, your bowls of stew.
Somebody who orders that--

22:21.715 --> 22:23.442
let Caesar carry it.
He needs the workout.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.741
- Well, that's not really --
- And if you have any questions

22:25.776 --> 22:28.842
or are worried about anything
having to do with...

22:28.868 --> 22:31.280
you know, what's going on there,
I'll call my sister, Liz --

22:31.296 --> 22:32.562
she's a veteran.

22:32.576 --> 22:34.192
Thanks, Luke.

22:34.406 --> 22:36.172
Anyway, uh...

22:36.717 --> 22:38.513
you two are gonna be great.

22:38.527 --> 22:40.250
You'll be great parents.

22:45.396 --> 22:46.731
Zach...

22:47.376 --> 22:49.520
we're gonna be parents.

22:49.727 --> 22:53.451
Yeah, it's like...
we're not just kids anymore.

22:53.996 --> 22:55.860
We're one of them now.

22:56.027 --> 22:58.361
Parents don't have to
be told what to do.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.062
Parents do the telling.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.300
That's right.

23:01.317 --> 23:04.191
Besides, if we say no,
what's the worst your mother could do?

23:06.556 --> 23:10.763
Seriously, b-babe,
w-what is the worst she could do?

23:12.548 --> 23:13.853
Yeah.

23:14.296 --> 23:15.491
What, "yeah"?

23:15.507 --> 23:17.553
That's what I'm talking about.

23:17.566 --> 23:18.913
Yeah?

23:18.945 --> 23:20.492
I'll say.

23:21.047 --> 23:22.752
I can barely talk.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.970
Uh-huh, which is, uh...

23:24.988 --> 23:26.722
Saying something?

23:28.557 --> 23:31.633
I could just live in
this room forever.

23:31.648 --> 23:33.083
Let's.

23:33.096 --> 23:34.761
- Except--
- No "except."

23:34.777 --> 23:36.413
It's decided. Call the guy.

23:36.426 --> 23:38.111
Come seal the doors.

23:38.127 --> 23:40.493
- I'm too hungry!
- Me too.

23:40.508 --> 23:42.462
My stomach is a pit.

23:42.477 --> 23:45.611
I know. If I don't eat something,
my stomach's gonna eat me.

23:45.705 --> 23:47.543
We need to find food!

23:47.556 --> 23:48.861
We do!

23:50.417 --> 23:52.082
Look at that view.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.341
It's so beautiful,
I could eat it.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.373
- Oh, my god.
- What?

23:58.388 --> 24:00.332
- I could totally fix this!
- How?

24:00.348 --> 24:02.041
I'm not gonna tell you.

24:02.285 --> 24:03.441
- Let's shower.
- Tell me.

24:03.458 --> 24:04.621
- It's a surprise.
- Tell me.

24:04.638 --> 24:05.921
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on!

24:05.956 --> 24:07.210
Not telling.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.322
Is this your fix?

24:09.336 --> 24:11.470
To get me to think
about what your fix is

24:11.486 --> 24:13.273
instead of thinking
about food, huh?!

24:13.287 --> 24:14.622
- Is it working?
- A little.

24:14.637 --> 24:16.731
All I can tell you is it's
bigger than a breadbox.

24:16.745 --> 24:18.441
Mmm, bread.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.432
- Come on!
- Okay!

24:20.545 --> 24:21.802
There's Dean.

24:21.815 --> 24:23.362
Ooh, Dean is smokin'.

24:23.375 --> 24:24.991
Oh, yeah. Dean's a fox.

24:25.008 --> 24:26.202
- He looks tall.
- He is.

24:26.218 --> 24:27.702
How can you tell from
a picture of his face?

24:27.738 --> 24:29.252
- It's a talent I have.
- Spooky.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.063
Yeah, right, I figure I'll be
recruit by the FBI any day now.

24:32.077 --> 24:34.052
It's a very specific specialty.

24:34.067 --> 24:35.602
Wait, there you are.

24:35.617 --> 24:38.001
Oh yeah. That was my first
year at the Chilton paper.

24:38.015 --> 24:39.962
Look at you and your
big Rory smile.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.331
What are you there -- 5'2"?

24:41.347 --> 24:42.532
More like 5'7".

24:42.548 --> 24:44.051
Are you sure?
You don't look like 5'7".

24:44.086 --> 24:46.862
I'm sure. Is this dye supposed
to smell all vinegary?

24:46.878 --> 24:48.130
Mm-hmm. It means it's working.

24:48.147 --> 24:49.373
I feel like an easter egg.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.463
Boyfriend is gonna totally
freak when he sees this color.

24:51.496 --> 24:52.863
- Freak, like, be mad?
- No.

24:52.877 --> 24:55.170
First, he'll be like,
"whoa," and then like, "I like it,"

24:55.186 --> 24:57.521
and I'll be like,
"thanks," and he'll be all,

24:57.538 --> 24:59.461
"I thought you looked
pretty good before, too,"

24:59.478 --> 25:01.573
and I'll be like,
"better?" And he'll be like,

25:01.587 --> 25:03.441
"No, I think you look good
no matter what you do,"

25:03.477 --> 25:05.261
and I'll be like,
"what if I got a mohawk?"

25:05.278 --> 25:07.163
and he'll be like,
"even if you had a mohawk,"

25:07.178 --> 25:09.320
and then we'll look at each other
all goony-eyed, and we'll kiss,

25:09.355 --> 25:11.313
and he'll say,
"don't get a mohawk."

25:11.328 --> 25:12.730
And too bad if he
doesn't like it.

25:12.748 --> 25:14.640
Serves him right for
working all the time.

25:14.658 --> 25:16.062
Boyfriend's got great hair.

25:16.077 --> 25:18.162
Oh, the best.
It's, like, beyond human.

25:18.175 --> 25:19.653
Like, Conan O'Brien's?

25:19.667 --> 25:21.140
No, it's, like, really full.

25:21.156 --> 25:22.473
It's more like a
cartoon character.

25:22.506 --> 25:25.060
Yeah, it's like Snap's hair from Snap,
Crackle, and Pop.

25:25.076 --> 25:26.452
Wait, am I thinking of Crackle?

25:26.465 --> 25:27.731
Is Crackle the one
who wears a hat?

25:27.766 --> 25:29.633
They all wear hats.
It's like part of their uniform.

25:29.668 --> 25:31.513
Yeah, but one of them wears
it all the way on his head,

25:31.545 --> 25:33.870
and one wears it further
back so his bangs swoop out.

25:33.885 --> 25:36.002
That's Pop.
The blond one's definitely Pop.

25:36.018 --> 25:38.741
Okay, so boyfriend's got the color
of Crackle and the style of Pop.

25:38.755 --> 25:40.313
Ooh! We should make
Rice Krispy treats.

25:40.327 --> 25:41.813
- Oh, my gosh!
- Yes!

25:43.246 --> 25:45.843
I think there is a cake
pan in that broom closet.

25:45.855 --> 25:46.672
Broom closet?

25:46.687 --> 25:49.421
Yeah, my mom's not really
into baking or brooms.

25:49.766 --> 25:51.573
Okay, so the butter's
in the fridge,

25:51.587 --> 25:54.181
and I will get the marshmallows
and the Rice Krispies.

25:54.196 --> 25:57.372
Oh, my god!
Come here, you guys!

25:57.387 --> 25:59.560
It's Rory through the ages.

25:59.936 --> 26:01.942
Oh, I totally forgot
that was there.

26:01.958 --> 26:05.523
How cool is this? Can you believe
you were this short in 1991?

26:05.537 --> 26:06.131
No.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.143
Check it out.
The next year, you shot up like a weed.

26:08.178 --> 26:09.690
That's when I
finally quit smoking.

26:09.708 --> 26:12.571
This is awesome. You have a record
here of you literally growing up,

26:12.587 --> 26:14.522
and here you are when you're,
like, 7,

26:14.535 --> 26:16.960
and then here you are when you're
ready to graduate college.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.281
Yeah.

26:18.476 --> 26:19.871
It's freaky.

26:19.887 --> 26:21.861
Oh! There's the cake pan.

26:21.876 --> 26:23.783
Let's get cookin'!

26:25.356 --> 26:28.071
Well, well,
what do you know? FermÃ©.

26:28.867 --> 26:31.071
Listen, honey,
if they weren't open at 11:00,

26:31.085 --> 26:32.853
I don't think they're gonna be
open at 5:00 in the morning.

26:32.885 --> 26:33.780
Trust me.

26:33.798 --> 26:35.802
Trust is not the point.

26:35.817 --> 26:37.772
The point is food
and finding some,

26:37.785 --> 26:41.483
not standing in front of
closed restaurants feel--

26:42.177 --> 26:43.793
Monsieur Hayden...

26:43.807 --> 26:45.171
mademoiselle Gilmore.

26:45.187 --> 26:46.432
That's us.

26:46.446 --> 26:48.492
Welcome to L'ArpÃ¨ge.

26:48.628 --> 26:50.110
Please come in.

26:50.128 --> 26:51.913
Your table is ready.

26:52.756 --> 26:54.720
After you, mademoiselle.

27:03.918 --> 27:04.990
Thank you.

27:06.116 --> 27:07.390
Thank you.

27:12.325 --> 27:15.050
Thanks. What is this?

27:15.568 --> 27:18.171
I'll give you a moment
to peruse the wine list.

27:18.188 --> 27:20.360
Please let me know if
you have any question.

27:20.378 --> 27:21.911
Thank you. We will.

27:21.925 --> 27:23.522
Merci.

27:26.996 --> 27:28.683
Pretty cool, huh?

27:28.696 --> 27:29.801
How did you --

27:29.815 --> 27:32.972
I'm thinking the '78 Latour.
Sounds like a classic car.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.733
Honey, how did you do this?

27:35.746 --> 27:37.532
I have my ways.

27:37.548 --> 27:39.290
Tell me!

27:39.837 --> 27:41.583
- You really want to know?
- Yeah!

27:41.587 --> 27:42.891
It might take away
some of the magic.

27:42.925 --> 27:44.321
I'll risk it.

27:45.148 --> 27:48.832
Well, I was lying in bed,
and I was thinking about us,

27:48.848 --> 27:52.410
and how, when we were 16,
we planned our trip to Paris,

27:52.425 --> 27:54.980
but it kind of got derailed.

27:55.496 --> 27:56.663
I'll say.

27:56.677 --> 28:00.110
And then I was thinking about how
amazing it is that after everything --

28:00.126 --> 28:03.652
the years, the distance,
the screw-ups, everything --

28:03.667 --> 28:07.042
we finally managed to make it
here and how, in some ways,

28:07.057 --> 28:10.553
it feels like nothing has
changed and no time has passed.

28:11.268 --> 28:12.752
I know.

28:12.795 --> 28:16.300
But then I started thinking about
all the things that have changed.

28:16.315 --> 28:18.761
When did you do
all this thinking?

28:18.776 --> 28:22.371
And I realized the one
big thing that has changed

28:22.385 --> 28:26.053
is that now...
I'm totally loaded.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.480
Okay.

28:27.496 --> 28:29.803
And I guess, in some ways,
I'm not quite used to it

28:29.815 --> 28:31.711
because I didn't
even think earlier

28:31.726 --> 28:34.463
that I might be
able to use that.

28:34.475 --> 28:37.263
You totally bribed
them to open.

28:37.277 --> 28:40.513
Not bribed --
gave financial incentive.

28:40.526 --> 28:42.213
Oh, my god!

28:42.457 --> 28:43.300
I know.

28:43.316 --> 28:45.373
You totally bribed
them to open!

28:45.388 --> 28:48.651
You don't have to whisper.
Everybody here knows.

28:49.668 --> 28:53.540
I just can't believe that
people really... do this.

28:53.557 --> 28:54.992
Apparently.

28:55.007 --> 28:56.971
- Cool!
- Right?

28:56.988 --> 28:58.943
And I was prepared to do
other things to get you fed.

28:58.977 --> 29:01.953
I mean, I had backup plans that
included theft and chicanery.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.102
Ooh. Chicanery? For me?

29:04.115 --> 29:05.872
Anything for you.

29:06.015 --> 29:07.683
Anything.

29:08.638 --> 29:10.352
So, you happy?

29:10.567 --> 29:12.450
Really happy.

29:13.058 --> 29:14.830
This is wonderful.

29:15.998 --> 29:17.812
You didn't have to do it,
you know?

29:17.828 --> 29:19.161
I wanted to.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.212
I would've been happy
with a croissant.

29:21.225 --> 29:23.283
Or a park bench. I know.

29:23.297 --> 29:25.090
Why a park bench?

29:25.325 --> 29:27.733
Remember when we were 16
and planning to go to Paris?

29:27.745 --> 29:29.962
We always said we'd
sleep on a park bench.

29:29.975 --> 29:31.882
Oh, yeah!

29:31.895 --> 29:34.820
Well, because we didn't have any money,
so we couldn't afford a hotel,

29:34.838 --> 29:37.213
we'd have to sleep
on a park bench.

29:37.286 --> 29:39.563
I can't believe
you remember that.

29:40.598 --> 29:43.550
I'd still sleep on a
park bench with you.

29:43.746 --> 29:45.753
Name the bench.

29:46.286 --> 29:48.362
Compliments of the chef...

29:48.786 --> 29:53.303
langoustine on a bed of mush
and candied carrot cannelle.

29:53.746 --> 29:55.112
Have you decided on the wine?

29:55.125 --> 29:58.190
Yes. We're gonna go
with the '78 Latour.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.990
Excellent choice, monsieur.

30:03.717 --> 30:06.461
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

30:07.888 --> 30:10.020
So, this fix?

30:10.037 --> 30:11.873
Not only bigger
than a breadbox,

30:11.887 --> 30:13.431
also a lot better.

30:13.446 --> 30:14.952
Told you.

30:15.656 --> 30:17.290
Hey, when we're done,

30:17.305 --> 30:20.342
can we go back to
that beautiful bed?

30:20.355 --> 30:22.031
You don't want to
sleep on a park bench?

30:22.048 --> 30:24.161
Mmm... no park bench.

30:25.098 --> 30:26.601
Thank god.

30:37.818 --> 30:39.470
Oh yes, this is very nice.

30:39.485 --> 30:42.631
So, mama, the reason we wanted
to talk to you is 'cause --

30:42.647 --> 30:44.690
If you're wondering about your room,
it isn't ready yet.

30:44.725 --> 30:47.181
We weren't wondering -- mama!

30:47.195 --> 30:48.963
You want two separate
beds, correct?

30:48.976 --> 30:50.610
Well, that's not
really the issue.

30:50.625 --> 30:51.861
Better for Zach to
have his own bed.

30:51.898 --> 30:54.362
Soon, you will be giant.
Who can sleep with that?

30:54.378 --> 30:57.680
Mama, could you stop for a minute?
We really need to talk.

30:57.698 --> 31:00.953
I have to unload this shipment.
I may be old, but I can multitask.

31:00.967 --> 31:02.431
The thing is, Mrs. Kim,

31:02.446 --> 31:05.722
when you said that we should move
in with you and I said, "cool,"

31:05.736 --> 31:08.291
what I meant was,
"that's cool...

31:08.307 --> 31:10.813
that you're offering to
have us move in, but...

31:10.828 --> 31:11.792
no."

31:11.805 --> 31:13.263
What do you mean, "no"?

31:13.327 --> 31:15.663
We really appreciate
the offer, mama,

31:15.677 --> 31:18.590
But Zach and I are going to be
parents soon, and we're adults...

31:18.605 --> 31:20.961
You know, young adults.
Not like I'm gonna be smoking a pipe,

31:20.998 --> 31:23.011
and she's gonna be all, "hey,
let's watch '60 minutes.'"

31:23.046 --> 31:25.031
...and we're gonna be
starting our own family,

31:25.046 --> 31:29.241
and it's important to us that
we do that in our own home.

31:30.576 --> 31:33.333
We can do this, mama.
We're ready.

31:35.188 --> 31:38.602
Very well.
I respect your decision.

31:44.217 --> 31:45.631
Cool!

31:45.757 --> 31:47.853
How much do you love this hair?

31:47.866 --> 31:49.043
So much!

31:49.056 --> 31:51.252
Okay, now we're gonna have
to start a girl band.

31:51.268 --> 31:52.292
We so have to.

31:52.307 --> 31:53.851
We'll pretend we're a
norwegian girl band,

31:53.886 --> 31:55.811
and we can purposely
lip-synch just slightly off.

31:55.828 --> 31:57.480
- Oh, we'll be famous!
- We'll be huge!

31:57.498 --> 32:00.031
You can write articles about
us in the Yale Daily News.

32:00.048 --> 32:00.671
Yeah.

32:00.685 --> 32:03.751
You can say things like, we're the
hottest thing to come out of
Norway since...

32:03.786 --> 32:05.050
what came out of Norway?

32:05.066 --> 32:07.961
Well, we got the vikings,
we got Edvard Munch,

32:07.977 --> 32:09.803
and that's all I got.

32:09.815 --> 32:11.813
I mean, you still have an
in at the newspaper, right?

32:11.845 --> 32:14.561
Sure she does. It's like once you're
president, you're president forever,

32:14.598 --> 32:15.922
unless you get assassinated.

32:15.935 --> 32:18.411
Actually, it's good Rory's
not editor anymore.

32:18.427 --> 32:20.213
More time to be in "The
Forbidden Fjords."

32:20.227 --> 32:21.330
Okay, yeah. Wait.

32:21.348 --> 32:22.700
We need to discuss the name.

32:22.715 --> 32:25.372
Rory, where are you on
"The Forbidden Fjords"?

32:26.417 --> 32:28.150
Oh, my god.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.240
Rory, are you okay?

32:30.256 --> 32:31.970
- I'm fine.
- Do you hate your hair?

32:31.985 --> 32:33.383
- 'Cause you can change it.
- So easy.

32:33.418 --> 32:36.022
No, no, no, I love my hair.

32:36.035 --> 32:38.180
It's -- it's nothing.
It's stupide.

32:38.198 --> 32:40.533
- It's not nothing. 
- What is it?

32:41.655 --> 32:44.790
Everything is just... ending.

32:44.808 --> 32:47.880
I just feel like everything
is gonna be over.

32:47.898 --> 32:49.252
I'm done at the paper.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.743
Soon I'm gonna be done at Yale,

32:50.756 --> 32:52.912
and it's just like I'm
standing on this cliff,

32:52.927 --> 32:55.322
looking out into
this huge, foggy...

32:55.335 --> 32:56.631
Abyss?

32:56.647 --> 32:58.701
...like, a huge, foggy abyss,

32:58.715 --> 33:02.233
and in my whole life,
there's never been an abyss.

33:02.245 --> 33:03.360
It's been abyssless.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.332
I've always known exactly
what is in front of me,

33:06.345 --> 33:08.893
and I've always known
exactly where I'm going,

33:08.905 --> 33:10.392
and now...

33:10.518 --> 33:12.200
I don't know what's out there.

33:12.218 --> 33:13.390
Besides fog.

33:13.406 --> 33:16.562
A ton of fog, and I hate not
kwowing what is out there.

33:16.576 --> 33:18.540
I mean,
what's going to happen to my career

33:18.555 --> 33:21.991
and my relationship with
Logan and the rest of my life?

33:22.005 --> 33:23.603
Rory...

33:24.946 --> 33:27.450
I'm so sorry,
I don't mean to...

33:27.467 --> 33:29.373
drag everything down.

33:29.385 --> 33:31.002
I so know what you're
talking about.

33:31.016 --> 33:32.300
Totally!

33:32.318 --> 33:34.020
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

33:34.036 --> 33:35.802
Once I move that tassel
to the other side,

33:35.816 --> 33:37.531
I have no idea what
the hell I'm gonna do.

33:37.547 --> 33:40.083
I mean, besides that FBI gig.

33:40.098 --> 33:41.340
I'm an art major --

33:41.356 --> 33:44.222
not like that's an obvious road
sign to the rest of my life.

33:44.237 --> 33:46.313
I can't believe you
guys worry about this.

33:46.328 --> 33:49.580
I mean,
you're so carpe diem-ish.

33:49.596 --> 33:51.530
How could you not be
worried about it?

33:51.545 --> 33:53.460
Everywhere you turn on campus,
someone's talking

33:53.476 --> 33:55.252
about their brilliant
plans for next year.

33:55.265 --> 33:57.461
Even our friends that were
really cool on laid-back --

33:57.476 --> 33:59.312
english majors,
philosophy majors --

33:59.327 --> 34:01.622
they're talking about
coming investment bankers.

34:01.638 --> 34:03.350
- When did that happen?
- Traitors.

34:03.366 --> 34:06.092
The other day, somebody used the
phrase "negative amortization."

34:06.107 --> 34:07.983
What the hell is that?!

34:12.975 --> 34:15.719
I have no idea what I'm doing.

34:17.105 --> 34:20.471
Maybe I should be
applying to grad schools.

34:20.485 --> 34:21.763
I mean...

34:21.996 --> 34:24.300
journalism school
or law school.

34:24.315 --> 34:25.992
Maybe I should go
to law school.

34:26.007 --> 34:28.391
Dude, you don't want
to go to law school.

34:28.405 --> 34:31.021
So don't want to
go to law school.

34:37.396 --> 34:39.110
You're amazing.

34:39.125 --> 34:40.411
No, you are.

34:40.428 --> 34:42.831
Don't start a fight with me.
I'm trying to say thank you.

34:42.847 --> 34:44.141
You're welcome.

34:44.158 --> 34:46.960
I mean, this is ridiculous.
This is incredible.

34:46.976 --> 34:48.540
Here we are just
finishing dinner,

34:48.558 --> 34:50.949
and the sun is coming up and
people are just going to work.

34:50.965 --> 34:52.553
I mean,
it's just all so unreal.

34:52.567 --> 34:55.371
I feel like any minute the
waiters could break into song.

34:55.386 --> 34:57.100
Well, if you want...

34:59.657 --> 35:01.043
What?

35:01.167 --> 35:03.001
I'm just so happy.

35:03.015 --> 35:04.841
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:04.857 --> 35:06.551
I don't ever want
to leave Paris.

35:06.568 --> 35:07.503
I know.

35:07.516 --> 35:10.101
I don't want it to be over,
I don't want it to end.

35:10.115 --> 35:12.293
It doesn't have to end.
When we get back to Stars Hollow,

35:12.326 --> 35:16.133
we can sleep all day and wander the
town in the middle of the night, and...

35:16.147 --> 35:18.241
that stuff we did back
in the hotel room --

35:18.255 --> 35:21.641
we can definitely do that
back in Stars Hollow.

35:21.657 --> 35:23.523
Are you saying we'll
always have Paris?

35:23.535 --> 35:25.551
I'm saying I love you, Lorelai.

35:25.568 --> 35:27.391
I love you, too.

35:27.738 --> 35:29.831
- And, Lor?
- What?

35:30.927 --> 35:34.570
Remember when I told you that I
would wait till we were both 80

35:34.586 --> 35:36.612
for you to figure out us?

35:39.506 --> 35:40.721
U-us?

35:41.358 --> 35:42.762
You and me?

35:43.218 --> 35:44.643
Right.

35:46.208 --> 35:47.872
I don't want to wait.

35:50.868 --> 35:53.181
- Chris...
- I mean it.

35:54.638 --> 35:57.191
But don't you think it's --
it's too soon?

35:57.206 --> 35:58.502
No.

35:58.536 --> 36:00.462
We've only been
dating a few months.

36:00.475 --> 36:01.753
Try 25 years.

36:01.765 --> 36:03.241
I know,
but you know what I mean.

36:03.258 --> 36:05.420
So it's taken us this long to
work it out, to figure it out,

36:05.455 --> 36:07.361
but we're here now.
We're ready.

36:07.376 --> 36:10.782
We're finally ready. Let's do it.
Let's do it right here in Paris.

36:10.797 --> 36:12.141
No, not here.

36:12.157 --> 36:14.040
- Why not?
- Well, Rory...

36:14.057 --> 36:16.021
Rory? Rory will be thrilled.

36:16.035 --> 36:19.971
Honey, I love you,
I really do, but...

36:20.447 --> 36:22.663
I think we should wait.

36:22.676 --> 36:24.022
Come on, Lor.

36:24.036 --> 36:26.600
We love each other.
We belong together.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.432
What do you say?

36:28.926 --> 36:30.931
Marry me.

36:34.228 --> 36:35.022
No.

36:35.038 --> 36:37.670
But those are cool names,
and whenever we call for "Marco,"

36:37.685 --> 36:40.841
Polo would answer with his name,
so we'd always know where he was.

36:40.858 --> 36:42.082
No.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.623
We don't even know if
they're going to be boys.

36:44.635 --> 36:47.001
- Mama!
- This place is a death trap!

36:47.017 --> 36:49.282
- What are you doing?
- We must think like a baby.

36:49.297 --> 36:51.422
Anything that can be grabbed
with little baby hands

36:51.436 --> 36:54.030
must be put up high or
locked away in cupboards.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.161
- How'd she get in?
- Who couldn't get in?

36:56.177 --> 36:59.791
Hiding a key under the mat is like
hosting a burglars-only open house.

36:59.807 --> 37:01.683
Mama, we're gonna
baby-proof the apartment,

37:01.696 --> 37:03.040
but we've still
got like months.

37:03.057 --> 37:04.630
Of course,
the drum kit has to go into storage,

37:04.665 --> 37:06.701
and you must throw
away all of these.

37:06.716 --> 37:07.800
My guitar picks?

37:07.816 --> 37:09.172
To you, they are guitar picks.

37:09.188 --> 37:11.973
To a baby, they are candy 
waiting to be choked on.

37:11.988 --> 37:14.750
That's true. One time, 
I was tuning to an open "e"

37:14.766 --> 37:16.321
and holding a pick
between my teeth,

37:16.337 --> 37:18.671
and Brian made this really funny sound,
and I snorted a laugh,

37:18.705 --> 37:20.981
so the pick went shooting
to the back of my throat.

37:20.997 --> 37:22.511
Mama, did you shop for us?

37:22.528 --> 37:25.483
Yes, and I will cook dinner as
soon as I am finished unpacking.

37:25.498 --> 37:27.872
- Unpacking?
- My things.

37:27.887 --> 37:29.511
You are right.
You are adults now.

37:29.525 --> 37:31.482
You should raise your
children in your own home.

37:31.496 --> 37:33.420
It would be wrong for
you to move in with me,

37:33.438 --> 37:35.631
so I will move in with you.

37:35.647 --> 37:36.911
Cool?

37:38.376 --> 37:39.762
Mama?

37:39.776 --> 37:41.130
Where's Brian?

37:41.146 --> 37:43.722
Don't worry about Brian.
Brian is fine.

37:43.845 --> 37:46.391
Um, could you please
pass the bulgogi?

37:50.385 --> 37:51.821
- French fries.
- Yep.

37:51.837 --> 37:53.131
Definitely french fries.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.433
Even if I haven't even gone
within a mile of one...

37:55.446 --> 37:57.340
Always smell like french
fries after a road trip.

37:57.377 --> 38:01.042
Smell like, feel like, a thin layer
of vegetable grease all over me.

38:03.696 --> 38:05.442
- Boyfriend!
- Hey!

38:05.458 --> 38:07.852
- I think boyfriend's here.
- No way.

38:08.438 --> 38:11.273
So once we saw the hair,
it was obvious -- girl band.

38:11.285 --> 38:13.683
Rory has the most awesome house.
You have to meet Rory.

38:13.695 --> 38:17.070
Rory... this is boyfriend.

38:17.126 --> 38:19.432
- Oh! I --
- Actually, it's Marty.

38:19.448 --> 38:21.060
Nice to meet you.

38:21.547 --> 38:23.112
You too.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.670
- Okay...
- So perfect. Go get yours.

38:25.687 --> 38:28.011
You're going to be, like,
"we have to wear these dresses."

38:28.267 --> 38:30.481
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?

38:30.497 --> 38:33.931
Um... why did you just pretend
like you didn't know me?

38:35.447 --> 38:37.412
I just thought it
would be weird.

38:37.426 --> 38:39.120
Weird? That we were friends?

38:39.135 --> 38:40.333
Why would that be weird?

38:40.348 --> 38:43.470
Well, what's the difference?
I mean, it's not important.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.740
But...

38:44.915 --> 38:47.433
yeah, but we used to
hang out all the time.

38:47.446 --> 38:48.942
Ta-da!

38:49.155 --> 38:51.250
Give it up for The
Forbidden Fjords!

38:51.265 --> 38:53.673
- Aren't these perfect?
- They are. They're perfect.

38:53.685 --> 38:55.701
Two Halloweens ago,
Lucy and I went to a party

38:55.717 --> 38:58.312
as "And Dawn,"
without Tony Orlando.

38:58.325 --> 38:59.513
Do you like me in this dress?

38:59.525 --> 39:02.542
Yeah. You look nice and shiny.
Goes great with your hair.

39:02.555 --> 39:04.183
Thank you. Was I right?

39:04.198 --> 39:05.822
Doesn't boyfriend
have unreal hair?

39:05.836 --> 39:06.942
He does.

39:06.956 --> 39:09.792
- So, the road trip --
- Was so far out?

39:09.805 --> 39:12.181
The town where Rory grew up is,
like, your perfect small town.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.861
You expect professor
Harold Hill to move there

39:13.897 --> 39:15.690
and sucker everyone into
buying band instruments.

39:15.725 --> 39:19.213
It's, like, ideal, but not scary,
"a serial killer lives next door" ideal.

39:19.228 --> 39:20.912
4-h club ideal.

39:35.568 --> 39:37.302
Bonsoir, house.

39:37.316 --> 39:39.062
Feels good to be home, huh?

39:39.075 --> 39:40.540
So good.

39:40.907 --> 39:43.083
It's funny when you go away,

39:43.096 --> 39:44.730
even on a short trip...

39:44.748 --> 39:46.992
everything looks a little
different when you get back.

39:47.005 --> 39:48.161
Yep.

39:49.336 --> 39:52.091
Of course, now I'm seeing it
with a french perspective.

39:52.108 --> 39:53.371
How's it look in french?

39:53.386 --> 39:55.601
American and dusty.

39:56.246 --> 39:58.723
I'm gonna go get the
rest of our stuff.

40:00.706 --> 40:03.122
Welcome home, Mrs. Hayden.
