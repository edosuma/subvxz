He won't talk to Maria or me. I've
never even seen him like this before.

06:30.122 --> 06:33.854
Oh, but there is
one piece of good news.

06:33.926 --> 06:38.796
- Kyle started seeing someone. Vicky Delaney.
- Oh.

06:38.864 --> 06:42.698
Maybe she's gonna take his mind off
all of his suspicions.

06:42.768 --> 06:44.702
- Right.
- Right.

06:44.770 --> 06:47.398
Oh, and apparently
it's gotten really serious...

Have you noticed anything strange
about Michael lately?

07:15.734 --> 07:20.831
- What do you mean?
- Maybejust the way he acts around Maria.

07:22.307 --> 07:25.902
Have you observed any differences
in his behavior at all?

07:25.978 --> 07:28.413
Are you saying there's something going
on between Michael and Maria?

07:28.480 --> 07:31.677
No, I'm not.
I'm not saying that.

07:33.552 --> 07:36.351

- Yes.

07:39.391 --> 07:42.656

- What are you doing here?
- This Topolsky woman calls me up...

08:10.422 --> 08:14.757

to come in here and discuss Maria's future.

08:14.826 --> 08:16.760
<i>And then when I get here,

08:16.828 --> 08:19.525

is “disappeared?

out of my hectic schedule to meet her.

to protect Max Evans...

09:03.675 --> 09:05.837

with our friendship.

- No, that's not true.
- You said that you were going to tell me...

09:09.081 --> 09:11.311

and you didn't.

09:11.383 --> 09:14.318

- Alex, I know.

09:14.386 --> 09:18.254

lust tell me, and it'll be okay.

09:18.323 --> 09:20.815
- I can't.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.259

we acted on any, you know, urges.

but when I have urges...

11:22.080 --> 11:24.777
you're not exactly

11:24.850 --> 11:26.944
Yeah, I realize that.
But the point is...

11:27.018 --> 11:28.952
we can't let things
spin out of control.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.954

11:48.640 --> 11:50.574

11:50.642 --> 11:54.101
is that I don't see
you and Michael together.

11:54.179 --> 11:56.511
Do you two talk
or do you just like-

11:56.581 --> 11:58.515
Of course we talk.

Oh,yeah. Well, I appreciate
the sentiment, Sheriff...

13:36.281 --> 13:38.773
but it did scar me
for life and all, so-

13:38.850 --> 13:41.046
You were breaking the law.

13:41.119 --> 13:44.180
You were stoppin' honest, hardworking

13:44.255 --> 13:46.349
Those honest,
hardworking people...

13:46.424 --> 13:50.054

- Well, it is kind of the point-

<i>There were more than 20

cowboy boots...</i>

14:20.091 --> 14:22.116

14:23.795 --> 14:28.198
Well, I had to arrest
somebody, so-

14:28.266 --> 14:31.167
Well, I don't know
what to say.

14:31.236 --> 14:35.070
I'm outraged.

15:08.006 --> 15:11.032
<i>So, uh, what about guys?

15:11.109 --> 15:14.443
that you've got all these guys
in school interested in you.

15:14.512 --> 15:17.038
Like, practically
every single one of them, but...

15:17.115 --> 15:19.106
you kind of tend
to keep pretty platonic.

15:20.685 --> 15:22.619
Have you been researching me
or something?

15:22.687 --> 15:25.019
No, I haven't
been researching you.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.889
I just- I don't know.
I was just kind of curious...

15:27.959 --> 15:30.451
if there was a reason you don't
move forward with any of it.

15:30.528 --> 15:32.997
<i>If it's because of
the fact that--</i>

15:33.064 --> 15:34.998
Were you afraid?

15:35.066 --> 15:38.127
I mean, to let someone in,
to let someone see who you really are?

15:38.203 --> 15:40.797
Yeah, of course I am.

15:40.872 --> 15:43.773
Well, multiply that
by about a million.

33:44.919 --> 33:47.854
Obviously,
it's not our fault.

33:47.922 --> 33:50.687
All right?
They kept the other guys, not us.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.530
He let everybody else go
except Liz and Alex.

33:57.532 --> 34:01.628
- We are so screwed.
- It's gonna be okay.

34:01.703 --> 34:03.967
We should have told him.

34:04.038 --> 34:06.973
- What?
- We should have told him about us.

34:08.777 --> 34:12.940
<i>I know this sounds crazy,
Max, but I feel something about him.</i>

34:13.014 --> 34:15.210
Like he's okay.

34:15.283 --> 34:17.342
Like we'd be
better off including him.

34:20.789 --> 34:22.757
Alex.

34:23.824 --> 34:26.054
Alex.

34:26.127 --> 34:28.527
<i>A__</i>

34:28.596 --> 34:31.998
<i>Alex, I just need
to talk to you.</i>

34:33.168 --> 34:35.830
- I just want t0-
- Let me just ask you.

34:35.904 --> 34:39.272
<i>Did you arrange
that whole Isabel thing?</i>

34:39.340 --> 34:41.434
What- What Isabel thing?

34:41.509 --> 34:46.242
Her trying to seduce me
into keeping quiet.

34:46.313 --> 34:48.942
I don't know anything
about that, Alex, I swear.

34:49.016 --> 34:50.815
'Cause--
'Cause it's just low.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.650
You know?
I mean, she'sjust low.

34:53.721 --> 34:55.746
And I'm done.

34:55.824 --> 34:58.452
I'm done protecting you...

34:58.526 --> 35:01.188
or her or anyone else
you're associated with.

35:01.262 --> 35:04.789
'Cause I'm telling Sheriff Valenti
everything, verbatim.

35:04.866 --> 35:08.700
About replacing Max's
blood at the hospital...

35:08.770 --> 35:11.137
discovering
Topolsky was F.B.l...

35:11.206 --> 35:13.766
everything.

35:15.710 --> 35:18.145
No, look- Look, Alex.

35:18.213 --> 35:20.147
Look at- Listen to me.
You had just-

35:20.215 --> 35:23.116
You should know all of the facts
before you do something like this.

35:23.184 --> 35:25.118
I thought you said it wasn't
your secret to tell.

35:25.186 --> 35:29.419
The reason that Isabel did
whatever it is that she did-

35:29.491 --> 35:33.121
It's not that she's low.
She's just- She's scared.

35:33.194 --> 35:35.891
- Scared. Scared of what?
- Yes.

35:38.132 --> 35:40.157
Sh- She's scared
of being different.

35:40.235 --> 35:42.294
Oh, come on. Save it.

35:42.370 --> 35:45.465
<i>Alex, Max and Michael
and Isabel--</i>

35:45.540 --> 35:48.908
they are different from us.

35:48.977 --> 35:51.173
They're different in a way that,
if the wrong people found out...

35:51.246 --> 35:53.180
they would be
in a lot of trouble.

35:53.248 --> 35:55.910
I know the whole drugs thing
is a load of crap, Liz.

35:55.984 --> 35:59.818
Why would the F.B.l. be so interested
in three kids into drugs?

35:59.888 --> 36:02.118
Listen to me. This doesn't
have anything to do with drugs.

36:02.190 --> 36:04.454
Alex, Max,
Michael and lsabel-

36:07.529 --> 36:10.191
they aren't
from around here.

36:10.265 --> 36:12.700
Where are they from?

36:17.372 --> 36:20.000
What? Like, Wyoming?

36:23.044 --> 36:25.513
Okay, fine. Canada.
They're Canucks.

36:25.580 --> 36:28.606
<i>So, you're saying the F. B. I.
Is all over them...</i>

36:28.683 --> 36:31.311
because they're, like,
illegal aliens?

36:33.421 --> 36:35.412
Yeah, sort of.

36:36.424 --> 36:38.415
Listen, Alex.

36:40.261 --> 36:42.195
They're from
somewhere else.

36:42.263 --> 36:45.198
Liz, what are you talking about?

36:47.435 --> 36:50.166
God, there isn't anyway
for me to say this, but tojust-

36:51.806 --> 36:54.173
but to just say this, okay?

36:54.242 --> 36:57.007
Look, Alex.

36:57.078 --> 37:00.139
They think they were
in the 1947 crash.

37:00.214 --> 37:04.879
Okay, they were, like, in these
incubation pods for a really long time-

37:04.953 --> 37:09.356
like 4O years- and they came out in,
like, the form of humans.

37:09.424 --> 37:11.483
And now all of these
people suspect them.

37:11.559 --> 37:14.494
That's why Topolsky's here,
and that's why Valenti arrested us.

37:14.562 --> 37:17.793
And that's why we're here,
because he knows that I'm involved.

37:19.834 --> 37:25.329
I'm really sorry, Alex, but...
you're involved too.

37:25.406 --> 37:28.171
Liz, are you okay?

37:28.242 --> 37:32.338
Alex, you don't
even understand.

37:32.413 --> 37:37.146
The past few months have been
like absolute torture lying to you.

37:38.186 --> 37:41.520
I will never,
ever lie to you again.

37:42.824 --> 37:45.122
I promise.

37:47.695 --> 37:49.595
<i>[ Valenti]
Mr. Whitman!</i>

37:51.633 --> 37:54.933
Sleep all right?

37:58.306 --> 38:00.400
What say we go
down to my office?

38:00.475 --> 38:03.809
No. Right here.
I'm ready to talk.

38:05.213 --> 38:07.648
All right.

38:07.715 --> 38:12.277
I wanna know what your involvement is
with Liz, Max, Michael, and Isabel.

38:12.353 --> 38:15.084
And I wanna know what happened
with Ms. Topolsky.

38:28.236 --> 38:30.967
I'm ready to talk about the fact
that I'm a kid.

38:31.039 --> 38:34.441
<i>I'm 16 years old.
I'm a sophomore in high school...</i>

38:34.509 --> 38:39.470
<i>so what could I possibly have to do
with a teacher leaving?</i>

38:39.547 --> 38:42.244
What does any of this
have to do with you anyway?

38:42.316 --> 38:44.785
I'm just doin'
my job, son.

38:44.852 --> 38:47.617
I was at a party!
My only wish was that...

38:47.689 --> 38:50.624
while I was there, I engaged in
some sort of depraved activity...

38:50.692 --> 38:53.821
like drinking or sex,
but I didn't.

38:53.895 --> 38:56.990
- I didn't break any laws.
- Everybody who was at that party...

38:57.065 --> 38:58.999
was trespassing
on private property.

38:59.067 --> 39:01.968
And both of you were minors
in possession of alcohol.

39:03.638 --> 39:06.630
This has nothing to do
with that party, does it?

39:08.376 --> 39:11.277
<i>Sheriff, I want
out of here right now.</i>

39:11.345 --> 39:13.780
I demand it, or I'm going
to get a lawyer...

39:13.848 --> 39:19.343
<i>and I'm going to sue
for abusive treatment of a minor.</i>

39:19.420 --> 39:23.118
<i>I maybe 16,
but I know my rights.</i>

39:25.026 --> 39:26.653
[Sighs]

39:26.728 --> 39:29.129
Alex, you were amazing.

39:29.197 --> 39:33.600
- Well,yeah. Yeah, I was.
- [ Chuckling]

39:33.668 --> 39:37.366
So, um, how do you feel,
you know, about what I said?

39:37.438 --> 39:39.372
Well, part of me, uh-

39:39.440 --> 39:41.374
Part of me feels like
you've gone insane...

39:41.442 --> 39:43.911
and the other part of me
feels like I want some of...

39:43.978 --> 39:48.711
the massive doses of hallucinogens
you've obviously been taking.

39:48.783 --> 39:50.774
But...

39:52.053 --> 39:54.044
I don't believe
in aliens.

39:55.289 --> 39:58.054
Neither did I.

39:58.126 --> 40:00.220
You don't believe me, do you?

40:02.497 --> 40:04.989
I believe
that you believe.

40:05.066 --> 40:06.898
- Leave it at that.
- Okay.

40:06.968 --> 40:09.494
- Get home safe.
- You too.

40:12.140 --> 40:15.735
- See you at school.
- Bye.

40:18.946 --> 40:21.108
<i>[ Liz Narrating]
The heat wave finally broke...</i>

40:21.182 --> 40:23.116
and I'm probably
the only person in Roswell...

40:23.184 --> 40:25.209
who didn't benefit from it.

40:25.286 --> 40:27.220
But it's for the best.

40:27.288 --> 40:31.247
Because if Max Evans and I
had given in to temptation...

40:31.325 --> 40:34.351
if we had kissed each other
even once...

40:34.428 --> 40:38.126
it would have taken us somewhere
we both know we never should have gone.

40:38.199 --> 40:40.497
<i>[ Max ]
Liz, are you there?</i>

40:51.379 --> 40:52.710
Hi.

40:52.780 --> 40:54.646
Hi.

40:54.715 --> 40:57.810
- Can I come up?
- Yeah, sure.

41:05.126 --> 41:08.187
<i>G,' [Man Singing]</i>

41:08.262 --> 41:11.027
- That's very impressive.
- I try.

41:13.935 --> 41:17.166
- You really can't stay long.
- I know.

41:18.906 --> 41:22.069
I just wanted to tell you that I've
been thinking a lot about last night.

41:22.143 --> 41:24.737
Yeah, me too.

41:24.812 --> 41:27.679
When I saw Valenti
taking you away like that...

41:27.748 --> 41:30.718
it just hit home
for me, you know?

41:30.785 --> 41:32.844
How much knowing me
has screwed up your life.

41:35.189 --> 41:37.180
No, it's just
the opposite.

41:38.593 --> 41:42.223
- Thank you for saying that.
- It's the whole truth, Max.

41:44.832 --> 41:48.632
- I better go.
- Why?

41:48.703 --> 41:51.434
Because if I don't go right now,
things are gonna change.

41:51.505 --> 41:53.769
Change how?

41:56.744 --> 42:00.806
I'm gonna have to touch your hair,
'cause it's so soft.

42:02.650 --> 42:04.880
And I'd have to
tell you that...

42:04.952 --> 42:08.149
no matter what we go through,
it's all worthwhile for me...

42:08.222 --> 42:10.213
because we're together.

42:11.959 --> 42:15.327
- And then?
- And then...

42:16.731 --> 42:18.859
I'd have to do this.
