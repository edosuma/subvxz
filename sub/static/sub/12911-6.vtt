01:19.542 --> 01:22.432
Don Pietro, if I may...

01:22.510 --> 01:24.789
Are you sure it's the only solution?

01:24.858 --> 01:26.659
I need to look in his eyes,

01:26.714 --> 01:28.522
he's gotta say why that rat Ciro

01:28.584 --> 01:30.540
is still around.

01:32.873 --> 01:34.736
You know what's right.

01:34.785 --> 01:37.815
Blood can be chewed, not spit, Patrizia.

01:38.459 --> 01:41.253
Gennaro would be long dead
if he weren't my son.

01:41.291 --> 01:43.808
Let's go, it's a long trip.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.897
Your baptism favors...

03:14.005 --> 03:16.778
we bought 500.

03:20.561 --> 03:23.792
A coral child in the Virgin's arms.

03:24.968 --> 03:27.665
That's what your mother wanted,

03:28.015 --> 03:30.932
to honor Our Lady of Mount Carmel

03:31.260 --> 03:33.805
who performed the miracle.

03:37.501 --> 03:40.264
We even went to certain doctors,

03:40.885 --> 03:44.563
they said she couldn't have children.

03:45.205 --> 03:48.142
My father said to get a new wife,

03:48.205 --> 03:52.430
because a boss needs
someone to carry his name.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.023
I said they'd have to kill me,

03:56.352 --> 03:59.184
because I'd chosen your mother.

03:59.234 --> 04:00.835
And I did well,

04:01.193 --> 04:03.786
because your mother gave me you,

04:03.831 --> 04:05.850
a son.

04:12.932 --> 04:16.593
I gave that son the most important job:

04:17.262 --> 04:19.998
to kill Ciro Di Marzio.

04:20.329 --> 04:23.371
Instead he made a deal against me.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.728
If I wanted Ciro Di Marzio dead,

04:30.768 --> 04:33.022
I'd have killed him by now,

04:33.068 --> 04:36.029
but I didn't, it's not in our interest.

04:38.843 --> 04:43.606
Not our interest? I don't get it,
Gennarino, explain.

04:45.090 --> 04:47.566
Dad, you're getting old,

04:47.919 --> 04:51.689
you're stuck in the past,
you can't see the future.

04:51.741 --> 04:55.123
The future's the contacts I made,

04:55.209 --> 04:59.245
it's a direct line from our
home to the heart of Rome,

04:59.283 --> 05:01.811
it goes back and forth like a train.

05:08.084 --> 05:10.237
You're my son,

05:10.862 --> 05:13.521
you have to do what I say.

05:17.131 --> 05:19.589
It's true, I'm your son,

05:21.457 --> 05:24.448
but soon I'll be a father too.

05:27.211 --> 05:29.788
I have to make my own way.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.207
Now you can follow me, if you want.

05:36.138 --> 05:38.746
If I don't?

05:41.667 --> 05:43.833
You'll be alone,

05:43.875 --> 05:47.388
and alone you won't
go anywhere in Naples.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.817
Or you'd have already done it.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.030
Trust the son you wanted so much.

05:56.107 --> 05:58.580
At least once in your life,

05:58.639 --> 06:00.652
trust him.

06:15.183 --> 06:17.759
- Wow! Kickin' ass, Tonino!
- Here.

06:17.808 --> 06:20.129
No, I'm busy.

06:38.011 --> 06:40.319
So, what do we do?

06:44.629 --> 06:47.952
Roam around the Fiori and
Berlingieri neighborhoods,

06:47.997 --> 06:50.768
the Savastanos can't be let out,

06:50.828 --> 06:53.579
but if they do, come and tell us.

06:53.631 --> 06:55.932
- You up to it?
- You bet!

06:55.988 --> 06:58.533
- Guns?
- Guns...

06:58.894 --> 07:02.154
Guns are just for the armed
lookouts at intersections.

07:03.358 --> 07:05.364
Ok, but what do I get?

07:05.422 --> 07:07.256
350 a week for you

07:07.305 --> 07:09.348
and 150 for your friends.

07:09.414 --> 07:12.170
- Okay.
- Okay? Get moving!

07:12.216 --> 07:13.763
Let's go!

08:39.908 --> 08:43.231
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Mom's in the hospital.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.578
Don't leave that alley, understand?

08:47.634 --> 08:50.358
We can't risk our necks because of you.

08:50.413 --> 08:53.600
Hey, hands off! What do you want?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.938
What's this, asshole?

08:56.031 --> 08:59.780
We're starving in
the alley, this gets us by.

08:59.817 --> 09:01.978
You buy your stuff just from us!

09:02.046 --> 09:04.637
- 48 a kilo's too much!
- That's the price!

09:04.681 --> 09:06.952
Screw you, others sell at 30,

09:07.002 --> 09:09.158
how come you're selling at 48?

09:09.211 --> 09:12.348
Thank Gennarino you're still alive

09:13.056 --> 09:15.356
and that I don't kill you all.

09:15.395 --> 09:18.296
- So now, get back in your hole!
- Hands off!

09:18.346 --> 09:20.191
Go, asshole!

09:31.152 --> 09:33.127
- Eyes open, Bomber!
- Don't worry.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.418
Let me see.

09:49.941 --> 09:51.802
This is it?

09:53.016 --> 09:55.307
- Money!
- Here.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.010
You got it?

10:02.638 --> 10:05.568
- What piece is that?
- It's all he had!

10:05.613 --> 10:07.379
Shit gypsies!

10:07.440 --> 10:09.560
- You got bullets?
- Two.

10:09.611 --> 10:12.776
- One for me, one for you?
- Don't be funny.

10:45.479 --> 10:48.663
- On the ground!
- Shit face, on the ground!

10:48.698 --> 10:50.860
- Come with me.
- What do you want?

10:50.911 --> 10:52.262
Open up!

10:54.817 --> 10:57.244
Put the money in here, fast!

10:59.737 --> 11:01.364
Don't move!

11:01.695 --> 11:03.939
I'm doing it, one second!

11:03.979 --> 11:05.079
Make it fast!

11:05.129 --> 11:07.114
Freeze, don't move!

11:07.161 --> 11:09.073
Hurry!

11:09.757 --> 11:11.386
Give it here!

11:12.674 --> 11:14.857
- Done?
- Let's scram!

11:16.829 --> 11:18.623
Let's go!

11:29.463 --> 11:31.411
Okay, I get it.

11:31.742 --> 11:33.937
It's Dwarf.

11:49.429 --> 11:50.430
What is it, Rosario?

11:50.461 --> 11:53.135
They robbed the betting
agency on Corso Italia.

11:53.175 --> 11:55.422
- Who?
- The alley kids.

11:55.471 --> 11:58.101
- They left their neighborhood?
- Yeah.

11:58.161 --> 12:01.604
- Who ordered them?
- No one, they did it alone.

12:01.952 --> 12:04.600
- You're sure?
- They're like rabid dogs.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.403
No one in the clan can stand them,
but they're Genny's friends.

12:08.447 --> 12:12.357
What do we tell people? We kill them!

12:13.382 --> 12:16.143
We stay calm, Rosario.

12:17.777 --> 12:20.028
You said it yourself,

12:20.061 --> 12:22.394
those kids are theirs.

12:22.437 --> 12:24.579
They're Savastano's,

12:24.624 --> 12:27.388
and the Savastanos have to deal with it.

12:28.911 --> 12:30.810
Alert Malamore,

12:31.364 --> 12:33.496
alert them all.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.685
We have a deal, they can
move within their area,

12:37.755 --> 12:41.099
and we don't say a word,
but if someone slips up,

12:41.160 --> 12:43.432
goes out and makes a mess,

12:43.473 --> 12:45.238
they'll answer for it.

12:45.298 --> 12:46.837
Okay.

12:58.999 --> 13:02.455
They said that if we back the
robbery and break the deal,

13:02.509 --> 13:04.675
we gotta say it to their faces.

13:11.811 --> 13:13.251
Don Pietro!

13:19.768 --> 13:22.151
He had to tell me himself

13:23.427 --> 13:26.158
because I never realized it.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.992
What?

13:28.658 --> 13:31.447
I never trusted him.

13:36.344 --> 13:40.195
My father always said
little children need milk,

13:40.841 --> 13:43.991
but grown children need trust.

13:58.112 --> 14:01.569
Tell Malamore we respect Gennaro's deal.

14:02.777 --> 14:06.320
He must deal with the alley boys.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.766
- Bomber, give me 50 Euros.
- Here.

14:33.701 --> 14:37.317
- We scared them fucking shitless.
- Chaos, Trak!

14:37.370 --> 14:39.712
Did you see that fat guy?

14:40.066 --> 14:42.651
He peed his pants!

14:56.847 --> 14:58.729
Who is it?

15:01.990 --> 15:04.619
- Linx!
- Hi, Bomber!

15:04.683 --> 15:06.264
What's up, guys?

15:06.326 --> 15:08.051
What's the matter?

15:19.798 --> 15:22.168
Don't move, asshole!

15:22.834 --> 15:25.238
Come here, you piece of shit!

15:29.287 --> 15:32.042
You'd already be dead
if it was up to me.

15:32.692 --> 15:36.582
Think I forgot you shot
outside my house?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.963
But there's a deal now,

15:40.297 --> 15:43.324
and Don Pietro said
we have to respect it,

15:43.378 --> 15:45.651
and so do you, okay?

15:47.272 --> 15:48.779
Let's go.

16:07.774 --> 16:10.350
Hey kid, get me Carmine!

16:10.983 --> 16:13.559
- Keep your eyes open.
- Don't worry.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.770
Carmine, they're asking for you!

16:17.934 --> 16:20.216
What the fuck does he want?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.785
What's up?

16:28.443 --> 16:31.812
Your little friends robbed
the betting agency,

16:31.885 --> 16:34.532
they left their area without permission.

16:34.630 --> 16:37.904
I don't know anything,
but we'll deal with it.

16:39.802 --> 16:41.871
I hear it's not going well.

16:41.931 --> 16:44.417
Who's it going well for these days?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.319
But the night's even darker for some.

16:50.364 --> 16:52.731
I have a proposal for you,

16:52.779 --> 16:54.932
come over to our side.

16:54.989 --> 16:56.539
Ciro,

16:56.581 --> 17:00.209
we're Savastano's, don't talk to me.

17:00.578 --> 17:03.677
What did being faithful get you?

17:06.873 --> 17:08.932
Where's Gennaro?

17:09.909 --> 17:12.036
I don't see him.

17:14.263 --> 17:18.164
You gave him your blood,
and he left you alone.

17:22.063 --> 17:25.373
You have nothing to do with them.

17:26.951 --> 17:28.790
Think about it.

17:29.509 --> 17:31.587
Pitbull, let's go!

17:46.660 --> 17:49.451
Little Bird, what did you tell Ciro?

17:50.684 --> 17:53.218
I said no way.

17:54.175 --> 17:56.904
Look what those bastards did to me!

17:58.728 --> 18:01.502
Should we be living this shitty life?

18:01.540 --> 18:05.294
I'm sick of it. Bomber, you?

18:05.656 --> 18:09.695
- We do what Ciro said.
- We'll be against the Savastanos.

18:09.736 --> 18:12.317
So what? They're stuck in their area!

18:12.367 --> 18:14.230
They don't even know
where Don Pietro is.

18:14.282 --> 18:17.390
Don Pietro won't be hiding forever.

18:17.439 --> 18:20.464
When he's out and raisin' hell,
on whose side will we be?

18:20.523 --> 18:22.725
Where we're best off.

18:23.076 --> 18:25.336
I agree.

18:26.646 --> 18:29.025
Then, do without me.

18:29.407 --> 18:31.272
Go!

18:31.325 --> 18:33.084
Bye, Little Bird!

18:33.737 --> 18:35.572
Coward!

18:38.423 --> 18:40.208
What did the alley kids say?

18:40.256 --> 18:42.633
They say okay.

18:43.003 --> 18:45.706
We're letting in rats.

18:46.987 --> 18:49.588
Everyone's got rats.

18:50.241 --> 18:54.416
Depends if the rats eat
provisions or one another.

18:54.452 --> 18:57.073
If another war breaks out?

18:57.409 --> 19:01.076
Neither Pietro nor the alley kids
are strong enough to fight us.

19:01.417 --> 19:05.239
It'll be like a dog fight.

19:08.196 --> 19:10.844
Worst thing is, a dog dies.

19:37.830 --> 19:40.786
Guys, how about makin' a clan?

19:40.879 --> 19:44.720
With one broken gun from the gypsies?

19:45.362 --> 19:47.452
We have hatred.

19:48.073 --> 19:52.242
- How much does Malamore's spot make?
- 150-200 thousand a week.

19:53.514 --> 19:56.609
- Hear that?
- And he says the spot's no good.

19:56.645 --> 19:58.147
Cry and be sly.

19:58.206 --> 20:00.603
Now we'll really make 'em cry!

20:00.646 --> 20:02.752
How strong are they?

20:03.104 --> 20:05.575
They have three sub-groups
and eight people

20:05.627 --> 20:09.438
plus four who prepare
drugs on the ground floor.

20:09.491 --> 20:13.003
They work from 6am to 4pm
and from 4pm to 1am.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.205
- On Saturdays till two?
- Yeah.

20:15.236 --> 20:18.433
The morning shift guy takes
the night shift the next day.

20:18.492 --> 20:21.580
They all get three free days a week.

20:23.582 --> 20:25.667
We'll make 'em shit their pants!

20:25.714 --> 20:27.719
They're already buried, Trak!

20:28.081 --> 20:32.187
More important:
where are Malamore's men?

20:34.852 --> 20:37.839
Second floor, apartment 9.

20:39.132 --> 20:41.667
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

20:48.696 --> 20:51.717
- Lift that bag!
- What the fuck do you want?

20:58.549 --> 20:59.795
Move!

21:28.561 --> 21:31.766
You're sure these and
hatred will be enough?

21:31.803 --> 21:34.836
Fausto, what's the problem?
Can't see a fucking thing at night,

21:35.207 --> 21:37.150
and those shits don't expect it.

21:37.181 --> 21:40.873
They gotta be scared,
like rats in glue!

21:40.916 --> 21:42.693
Take this, Trak!

21:56.680 --> 21:58.308
Bye, guys.

22:04.507 --> 22:06.995
- Things okay there?
- All okay.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.007
Things okay?

22:11.082 --> 22:13.073
It's over!

22:26.694 --> 22:28.784
See you tomorrow!

23:39.435 --> 23:41.367
C'mon, c'mon!

24:51.810 --> 24:53.807
Upstairs!

25:08.784 --> 25:10.355
Inside!

25:10.390 --> 25:12.754
Geo out, you piece of shit!

25:13.090 --> 25:14.783
Pony!

25:16.977 --> 25:18.887
Piece of shit!

25:25.587 --> 25:28.494
So? Where are the guns?

25:30.095 --> 25:32.218
Tell me.

25:32.581 --> 25:34.756
Tell me!

25:34.802 --> 25:37.314
Piece of shit, where are they?

25:37.653 --> 25:39.626
Top floor.

25:39.677 --> 25:41.996
What do you want?

25:42.695 --> 25:44.795
Go, go!

25:46.016 --> 25:47.569
Take this trash with you!

25:47.607 --> 25:48.945
Downstairs!

25:49.009 --> 25:51.981
- I'm going for the guns.
- I'll get more people.

26:15.464 --> 26:17.073
Downstairs, fast!

26:17.131 --> 26:19.531
I'll break your neck, move!

26:33.126 --> 26:35.334
Take this stuff down.

26:49.614 --> 26:52.053
Move, hear me?

26:54.366 --> 26:56.629
Piece of shit, c'mon!

27:00.622 --> 27:03.000
Get in, you bastard!

27:04.675 --> 27:07.201
Shut up, piece of shit!

27:08.480 --> 27:11.072
Be quiet, piece of shit!

27:11.102 --> 27:12.823
Motherfucker!

27:14.349 --> 27:16.179
Go, go!

27:23.142 --> 27:25.187
Move, fast!

27:25.243 --> 27:26.552
Shut up!

27:26.608 --> 27:28.115
- Get out!
- Nicola!

27:28.168 --> 27:30.192
- Careful with the children.
- Don't worry.

27:30.245 --> 27:32.063
C'mon!

27:32.104 --> 27:33.528
Make it fast!

27:34.400 --> 27:35.927
Move!

27:36.223 --> 27:37.695
Fast!

27:42.482 --> 27:44.871
Make it fast.

28:04.532 --> 28:06.585
- Where's Malamore's house?
- I don't know.

28:06.627 --> 28:08.203
- Where?
- I don't know.

28:08.240 --> 28:10.584
You don't know?

28:10.631 --> 28:12.237
- Where is it?
- There!

28:12.280 --> 28:14.116
Take this piece of shit downstairs!

28:24.311 --> 28:26.506
Say goodbye to your house.

28:51.861 --> 28:53.985
This is our dealing spot!

29:36.920 --> 29:40.397
If the alley guys rebelled,
it's Savastano's fucking problem,

29:40.445 --> 29:42.176
we respect deals.

29:42.242 --> 29:44.742
We don't care what happens between them.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.115
We've nothing to do
with Savastano's deal.

29:48.158 --> 29:51.725
- What do we get?
- What do we get?

29:52.346 --> 29:55.592
We make more money with Gennaro's coke,

29:55.638 --> 29:58.368
they come from the rich
neighborhoods to buy our stuff.

29:59.281 --> 30:02.917
It'll soon be like old times when
we were number 1 in Europe.

30:02.959 --> 30:05.932
That's worth ten
Berlingieri dealing spots!

30:31.040 --> 30:33.130
Sit down.

30:40.359 --> 30:42.824
Malamore's sure Ciro behind it.

30:42.884 --> 30:45.378
Ciro's not the problem,

30:45.413 --> 30:47.949
Berlingieri is ours

30:48.009 --> 30:51.177
and they have to respect
the deal with my son.

30:51.849 --> 30:55.862
My uncle rallied his men.
They've got guns, ready to act.

30:57.893 --> 31:00.364
We stood by, watching it all

31:00.415 --> 31:02.440
and nothing good happened.

31:03.375 --> 31:06.727
Tell Malamore we start with the rebels.

31:07.026 --> 31:10.118
They gotta eat their own shit.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.003
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

31:26.330 --> 31:28.085
Let's make if fast!

31:32.550 --> 31:35.057
It's all here?

31:35.681 --> 31:37.625
All of it.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.395
You're sure?

31:41.151 --> 31:42.601
Okay.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.467
- Bomber!
- And the money?

31:45.521 --> 31:47.569
First, we start working.

31:47.629 --> 31:50.802
From now on, Malamore's dealing
spots are ours, we're in charge.

31:50.850 --> 31:53.171
There's an extra for you too.

31:53.227 --> 31:55.503
What the fuck are you looking at?

31:56.058 --> 31:57.341
You rat!

31:58.258 --> 32:00.323
- Get him!
- Let's go!

32:14.714 --> 32:16.892
Don't worry, it's okay.

33:58.571 --> 33:59.836
Who is it?

34:00.189 --> 34:03.130
The betting receipts!

34:28.268 --> 34:31.251
Go buy yourself something!
You didn't see anything, ok?

34:41.592 --> 34:43.384
Wait.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.145
He's here.

34:51.951 --> 34:53.683
I'll be right back.

35:12.684 --> 35:14.699
Everything okay?

35:17.256 --> 35:19.578
Your friends rebelled.

35:21.024 --> 35:22.922
I know.

35:23.535 --> 35:25.765
But nothing changes,

35:26.381 --> 35:29.296
we have to stay focused on business.

35:29.350 --> 35:31.511
Your father will be fuckin' mad.

35:31.561 --> 35:33.433
What's he want to do?

35:34.588 --> 35:37.967
Gabriele, I'm in Rome,
I have another perspective.

35:38.400 --> 35:42.126
You're in Rome, but your
heart's in Secondigliano

35:42.983 --> 35:45.837
and our home's a time bomb.

35:45.872 --> 35:48.482
Your father and Ciro have the fuse.

35:49.052 --> 35:52.118
We have to focus on
business, you're right,

35:52.164 --> 35:55.640
but this mess is bad,
we know it better than anyone.

35:56.985 --> 35:59.234
Put this fire out, Gennaro,

35:59.316 --> 36:01.403
before it burns everything.

36:08.650 --> 36:10.314
Bye, Gabriele.

36:10.390 --> 36:12.400
Bye, Gennaro.

36:21.883 --> 36:23.621
Where are you going?

36:26.624 --> 36:29.950
To Naples, there's trouble.

36:31.968 --> 36:34.996
What do you care what happens in Naples?

36:37.390 --> 36:40.828
That's where my father
and brother are, you forget?

37:07.144 --> 37:09.627
You're family's here now.

37:11.182 --> 37:13.075
Our family.

37:18.384 --> 37:20.476
Azzurra, you're my life...

37:22.377 --> 37:24.430
I love you.

37:30.696 --> 37:33.520
But never get between me and my blood.

38:05.514 --> 38:08.997
We're here to talk, that's all, right?

38:09.040 --> 38:10.408
Right.

38:10.451 --> 38:13.166
No crap, I guaranteed for you both.

38:13.194 --> 38:14.911
Don't worry!

38:22.823 --> 38:24.804
Wait here.

38:25.166 --> 38:28.383
Stay here, straw burns near fire!

38:28.423 --> 38:30.325
Fuck off, you and straw!

38:36.387 --> 38:38.895
- How are you, Little Bird?
- Genny!

38:41.699 --> 38:44.463
- What's up?
- You're finally back.

38:44.511 --> 38:47.759
- Yeah, too bad it's like this.
- There was no other way.

38:49.610 --> 38:52.425
Don't trust Ciro Di Marzio,

38:52.459 --> 38:55.589
he's using you to
cause havoc in our clan.

38:56.189 --> 38:59.574
But then he'll throw you away,
like a used condom.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.735
So, why didn't you kill him?

39:02.604 --> 39:06.047
It meant another war,
everyone against everyone.

39:06.087 --> 39:09.395
They'd have come from Piscinola,
Ponticelli or center of Naples

39:09.441 --> 39:12.872
and taken everything,
I couldn't let that happen.

39:13.698 --> 39:16.495
Your place is by my side,
where it's always been.

39:16.540 --> 39:19.269
Till now it didn't seem like that.

39:19.579 --> 39:24.259
You disappeared, it's not
easy keeping up with a ghost.

39:26.023 --> 39:28.205
You gotta come back to us.

39:28.806 --> 39:30.707
Under what conditions?

39:32.517 --> 39:34.694
Like before,

39:34.755 --> 39:37.922
and I'll pretend nothing
happened these days.

40:00.577 --> 40:03.852
- What did he say?
- We gotta go back to him.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.438
Under the same conditions as before.

40:08.018 --> 40:10.246
- Where are you going?
- Wait.

40:10.938 --> 40:13.031
Gennaro, are things okay?

40:13.097 --> 40:15.160
Fine, Trak!

40:20.281 --> 40:22.504
We have to talk.

40:26.108 --> 40:27.576
What the fuck are you doing?

40:27.622 --> 40:29.938
Step down or I'll bury your name!

40:30.008 --> 40:33.485
Are you crazy? We were clear!

40:33.835 --> 40:36.609
From now on, anyone
with Savastano is against us.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.933
Carmine, who are you with?

40:38.984 --> 40:40.803
With me or them?

40:40.833 --> 40:42.574
I'm with you

40:42.616 --> 40:45.353
but we don't bury their name,

40:45.412 --> 40:47.352
they're the Savastanos.

40:47.395 --> 40:49.651
We don't touch them.

40:49.765 --> 40:51.681
We don't touch Genny.

40:51.719 --> 40:53.853
- Calm down!
- Get off!

40:55.671 --> 40:57.612
It ends here for us.

40:58.187 --> 41:00.802
For us too,

41:00.836 --> 41:02.996
but tell your father,

41:03.324 --> 41:05.464
from now on, the alley's done starving.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.328
Let's go!

41:10.592 --> 41:12.870
Piece of shit!

41:15.538 --> 41:16.887
Angelo!

41:17.851 --> 41:19.823
Get up, Malamore!

41:22.397 --> 41:23.837
Don Pietro,

41:24.661 --> 41:26.528
Malamore's all right,

41:26.570 --> 41:29.362
but Angelo, he's gone.

41:29.749 --> 41:33.386
Gennaro agreed those shits
could have Berlingieri

41:34.065 --> 41:36.772
and he guaranteed peace.

41:38.562 --> 41:42.127
At this point, Gennaro's word
doesn't count a fuck.
