03:23.437 --> 03:24.906
Why do you have
to go so far from the city

03:24.939 --> 03:26.440
to take care
of some old geezer?

03:26.473 --> 03:28.009
We really need the money.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.409
Did you forget
about the eviction notice?

03:29.443 --> 03:32.680
She's getting way more than what
you make in a month waitressing.

03:32.714 --> 03:35.817
Says Miss No Job.

03:35.850 --> 03:38.351
I'm trying. You know
I'm gonna help out when I can.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.721
Mm-hm. Sure.

03:39.754 --> 03:41.989
So, how does a waitress
get a car like this, Maria?

03:42.023 --> 03:43.991
- Mm-hm.
- James Miller.

03:44.025 --> 03:46.561
Ew. I thought
you didn't like him.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.261
Well, I like his car.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.566
- You stole it?
- No, I... I borrowed it.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.968
- So, what do you...
- It's nice to keep.

03:56.303 --> 03:57.605
Is that him?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.340
- I think so.
- I told you we were running late.

04:00.373 --> 04:01.743
- No sweater.
- Let's get out.

04:01.776 --> 04:03.243
Come on,
come on, come on.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.548
Thanks.

04:07.582 --> 04:10.685
- Miss Cherry Holly?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.587
I'm Dwayne from the Hallawells.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.688
Thank you for picking me up.

04:14.956 --> 04:16.924
- Here.
- Thank you.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.292
Here you go.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.028
Thanks. I can take it myself.

04:21.829 --> 04:22.997
Okay. Thank you.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.067
We love you.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.235
We'll see you next week,
sis, okay?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.070
- Call us when you get there, please, okay?
- Seriously.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.671
Of course, of course.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.375
Love you. Okay,
drive safe, please.

04:35.408 --> 04:37.945
- I'll try.
- And get that car back to that man.

04:37.979 --> 04:40.782
Oh, can I sit up front?

04:40.815 --> 04:42.550
- As you wish, miss.
- Okay, thank you.

04:44.351 --> 04:45.452
Thanks.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.455
Can we stop for something
cold to drink?

05:23.724 --> 05:25.593
My treat.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.062
Sorry, there's nothing
along the road.

05:34.802 --> 05:35.870
You like it?

05:37.872 --> 05:38.940
It was my grandma's.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.857
We're here.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.716
Wait here a moment.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.628
Miss Hallawell is ready
to see you now.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.131
No, please.
I'll take care of it.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.791
Please sit.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.632
It's so nice to meet you,
Miss Hallawell.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.744
Thank you.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.693
I truly appreciate this
opportunity, Miss Hallawell.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.195
I really need this job.

07:42.997 --> 07:44.665
Only 21, correct?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.034
Excuse me?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.203
My age?

07:49.236 --> 07:53.107
- Yes, people sometimes...
- Apart from the hospital,

07:53.140 --> 07:56.077
do you have any other experience
caring for the elderly?

07:57.211 --> 07:58.478
No.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.551
I expect you to take
excellent care of my father.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.087
You can count on me.

08:15.730 --> 08:17.798
Due to a skin condition,

08:17.832 --> 08:20.601
my father cannot be exposed
to strong light.

08:21.836 --> 08:24.271
Only use the gas lamps.

08:24.305 --> 08:28.209
The drapes must remain closed
even during the night.

08:35.016 --> 08:36.250
Wait.

09:01.342 --> 09:02.710
Come.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.035
Father.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.774
This nurse

09:34.942 --> 09:37.678
will be caring for you
while I'm away.

10:14.415 --> 10:17.251
Dwayne goes into town
every Thursday.

10:17.284 --> 10:21.622
To get father's blood supply
from donors at the hospital.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.794
How can I reach you
if there's an emergency?

10:26.827 --> 10:30.698
Dwayne will go into town,
and communicate with me.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.768
There are no telephones
in this house.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.083
Dwayne!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.953
She will eat in the kitchen.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.026
I'm sorry. I...

11:00.261 --> 11:01.295
Sorry.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.814
It's really good.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.054
Thank you.

14:02.076 --> 14:03.645
While I am away,

14:03.678 --> 14:05.913
the house
is your responsibility.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.457
And the girl, too.

14:34.509 --> 14:36.210
Good morning, Mr. Hallawell.

15:23.558 --> 15:24.692
Dwayne.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.563
- Miss?
- Call me Cherry.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.534
Can you lower the heater?

15:34.569 --> 15:36.170
We don't have a heater.

15:47.247 --> 15:48.550
Whose piano is that?

15:51.452 --> 15:53.420
It's Mr. Phillip's.
He used to play.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.159
Why? Do you play?

16:00.027 --> 16:01.596
No. I dance.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.781
Cherry.

20:15.817 --> 20:17.384
You shouldn't touch that.

20:21.288 --> 20:23.758
Oops.

20:23.791 --> 20:25.960
I'm going into town.
Do you need anything?

20:27.762 --> 20:29.229
Yes, please.

20:34.769 --> 20:35.837
Love letter?

20:37.004 --> 20:38.305
Maybe.

20:40.675 --> 20:41.876
It's to my friends.

20:46.614 --> 20:47.815
Okay, I'll see you later.

20:48.883 --> 20:50.250
See ya.

21:24.752 --> 21:25.853
Sorry.

21:53.881 --> 21:55.817
Dwayne told me
you used to play the piano.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.522
I would love to learn
how to play an instrument.

22:03.791 --> 22:05.092
I'm a great dancer, though.

22:05.927 --> 22:07.360
At least I think I am.

25:25.593 --> 25:27.028
Cherry.

25:27.061 --> 25:28.262
Cherry, wake up.

25:29.296 --> 25:30.631
Cherry.

25:47.048 --> 25:48.249
Come on.

25:56.190 --> 25:57.591
Are you okay?

25:58.225 --> 25:59.560
I'm okay.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.635
You're a good caregiver.

26:10.037 --> 26:11.305
Almost as good as me.

26:14.642 --> 26:16.310
You must have had
a very caring mother.

26:20.414 --> 26:21.916
Tell me about your family.

26:24.051 --> 26:25.953
We were on a boat

26:25.986 --> 26:27.655
escaping from our island.

26:29.156 --> 26:30.357
There was a storm.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.929
The last thing I remember
is the boat turning over.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.733
How do you end up here?

26:43.370 --> 26:44.705
I don't know.

26:46.273 --> 26:47.641
Miss Naomi

26:48.342 --> 26:49.743
kind of adopted me.

27:05.693 --> 27:06.794
I'm also an orphan.

27:10.698 --> 27:12.766
I always dreamed
a family would adopt me.

27:14.368 --> 27:15.669
No one ever did.

27:19.707 --> 27:20.941
Where do you live now?

27:22.309 --> 27:24.245
I've lived with my friends
my entire life.

27:25.346 --> 27:27.148
They're like my sisters.

27:27.181 --> 27:29.416
Do you remember anything
about your real family?

27:31.152 --> 27:32.186
My grandma.

27:34.822 --> 27:35.956
It's less every day.

27:40.361 --> 27:42.296
Hey...

27:42.329 --> 27:44.198
Do you know what I do
when I get down?

27:44.899 --> 27:46.100
No, what?

27:46.934 --> 27:48.068
I get down.

27:51.872 --> 27:54.742
This was Miss Naomi's
ballet studio years ago.

27:58.513 --> 28:00.047
What a wonderful space.

28:02.283 --> 28:04.018
Wait, I'm gonna
show you something.

28:22.469 --> 28:25.005
I love that record.

28:25.039 --> 28:27.041
I dance to it
with my sisters all the time.

28:33.515 --> 28:36.518
- You should join me.
- No, I'll just watch.

28:36.551 --> 28:37.918
Why not? It's fun.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.288
Come here. Just dance.

28:44.058 --> 28:45.226
I'll teach you.

28:46.193 --> 28:47.261
Just follow my moves.

28:51.932 --> 28:54.201
There you go.
Just keep rolling your arms,

28:54.703 --> 28:55.970
and move your hips.

28:58.872 --> 29:00.040
That's it, you've got it.

29:48.088 --> 29:49.189
What's wrong?

29:51.626 --> 29:52.926
We should stop.

33:51.533 --> 33:53.433
Were you able to rest,
Mr. Hallawell?

37:42.630 --> 37:44.966
- How's Mr. Phillip?
- All right.

37:48.870 --> 37:50.638
Are there any other Hallawells?

37:51.939 --> 37:55.042
It's only Mr. Phillip
and Miss Naomi.

37:55.076 --> 37:58.445
Miss Naomi always wanted to have
children, but she wasn't able to.

38:00.848 --> 38:02.984
So what are you gonna do
when you finish your job here?

38:03.684 --> 38:04.952
Go home,

38:04.986 --> 38:07.688
back to the hospital
and take some dance classes.

38:11.025 --> 38:12.292
What about you?

38:12.660 --> 38:13.795
Me?

38:13.828 --> 38:15.797
- Stay here.
- Forever?

38:19.534 --> 38:21.434
Don't you have any dreams?

38:21.468 --> 38:23.805
Dreams? About what?

38:23.838 --> 38:26.007
Life, travel.

38:27.041 --> 38:28.441
Having your own family.

38:29.944 --> 38:34.481
I was raised by the old servant Louie.
He taught me a lot.

38:34.515 --> 38:35.482
He taught me
that it doesn't matter

38:35.516 --> 38:38.451
where you are going
or what you do in life.

38:38.485 --> 38:41.454
Your fate's already written.
I believe it's true.

38:46.861 --> 38:49.462
Do you know where
the family photos are?

38:49.496 --> 38:51.331
I just really
love old pictures.

38:53.768 --> 38:54.802
You were so cute.

38:58.105 --> 39:00.007
That was taken
the day I came here.

39:01.175 --> 39:02.677
It's the only picture of me.

39:08.049 --> 39:09.984
Was there ever
another kid in the house?

39:11.118 --> 39:12.119
No.

39:16.456 --> 39:17.859
Is that Naomi?

39:17.892 --> 39:19.961
Yes, and her tutu.

39:19.994 --> 39:21.028
Stunning.

40:06.874 --> 40:09.877
That's Mr. Phillip's
sister Violet.

40:09.911 --> 40:12.412
Louie told me she was outcast
on the family.

40:19.820 --> 40:21.488
Look, that's Mr. Phillip.

40:22.690 --> 40:23.858
He was a grand man.

40:24.759 --> 40:26.459
A highly respected psychic.

42:11.832 --> 42:12.833
Mommy.

44:25.366 --> 44:26.433
Good morning, Phillip.

46:40.901 --> 46:41.902
Dwayne.

46:44.338 --> 46:46.807
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

46:49.143 --> 46:50.444
I'm going to the forest.

46:51.979 --> 46:54.582
- I would like to come with.
- You wanna come with me?

46:55.449 --> 46:56.850
Let me just grab my coat.

47:11.265 --> 47:12.366
It's special here.

47:53.273 --> 47:54.942
Can I try?

47:54.975 --> 47:57.512
- Try what?
- Shooting.

47:57.545 --> 47:59.413
I don't think
that's a good idea.

47:59.446 --> 48:01.081
This rifle is very powerful.

48:01.683 --> 48:02.916
I can handle it.

48:52.667 --> 48:53.668
Hold it steady.

49:15.523 --> 49:16.591
You got it.

49:43.217 --> 49:44.451
I told you I could do it.

49:47.087 --> 49:50.357
- That was beginner's luck.
- Maybe I'm just a natural.

49:50.390 --> 49:51.626
Like you are with dancing.

49:56.497 --> 49:57.498
Nah.

49:58.566 --> 49:59.601
I mean it.

50:00.568 --> 50:01.769
You can really move.

50:05.072 --> 50:06.073
So can you.

50:30.865 --> 50:32.165
Nice, I guess.

50:37.772 --> 50:38.773
Let's go.

50:56.658 --> 50:58.225
This can cause trouble, Cherry.

50:59.861 --> 51:01.529
They'll leave
first thing in the morning.

51:11.438 --> 51:12.740
Why are you here?

51:12.774 --> 51:15.142
It was Maria's idea.

51:15.175 --> 51:18.111
But you were the first one
in the car, baby.

51:18.145 --> 51:20.582
I'm really sorry, Cherry.
We just wanted to see you.

51:23.216 --> 51:25.252
So, did you and Dwayne...

51:26.186 --> 51:27.287
- get it on?
- Maria!

51:27.822 --> 51:28.823
Come.

51:34.729 --> 51:36.363
Jeez, it's so hot in here.

51:59.754 --> 52:00.822

Ugh. More for us then.

Here.

52:43.798 --> 52:45.900
Oh, come on, Dwayne.

52:45.933 --> 52:48.502
- Don't be such a drag. Play with us.

Dwayne does not want to play.

53:06.453 --> 53:08.923
- It's really easy.
- I'll explain.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.625
Are you paying attention,
Dwayney-Dwayne?

53:11.793 --> 53:13.226
Okay.

53:13.260 --> 53:16.496
Each one of us is gonna take a
piece of paper from out of this bag.

53:16.531 --> 53:20.601
Whatever comes out...
must be done.

53:23.370 --> 53:25.305
Okay, you go first.

53:25.338 --> 53:26.974
- Who wrote them up?
- Both of us.

53:29.510 --> 53:31.244
You have to do it

Oh, my God.

53:50.798 --> 53:52.667
Okay. You go.

53:52.700 --> 53:54.301
No, you first.

53:54.334 --> 53:56.003
Okay, scaredy-cat.

54:00.340 --> 54:01.475
Read it.

54:02.844 --> 54:04.746
Lick... the floor.

54:07.815 --> 54:10.818
- That's mine.
- Okay, okay. Ready?

54:12.787 --> 54:13.855
Do it, do it.

54:16.456 --> 54:18.391
Ew!

54:23.731 --> 54:25.432
Okay. You go.

54:34.609 --> 54:35.610
Quickly.

54:37.410 --> 54:39.013
What does it say?

54:39.046 --> 54:41.816
Kiss the boy you like the most.

54:41.849 --> 54:44.484
Well, that's easy. I mean,
there's only one boy, right?

54:47.522 --> 54:50.658
I mean, if that's cool
with you, right, Cherry?

54:50.691 --> 54:52.560

54:52.593 --> 54:55.328

54:58.132 --> 55:00.467

55:08.109 --> 55:09.744
Bravo!

55:16.017 --> 55:17.819
Oh, gosh.

55:17.852 --> 55:18.886
I need to pee.

55:21.956 --> 55:24.592
Oh, no, no. No, no. It's okay.
I can go by myself.

55:26.661 --> 55:28.863
Oh, where is it?

55:28.896 --> 55:31.464
It's downstairs,
down the hall, to your right.

55:33.167 --> 55:37.004
Downstairs,
down the hall, to your right.

55:37.038 --> 55:40.473
Downstairs, down the hall,
to the right.

55:42.944 --> 55:44.979
Downstairs, down the hall,
to the right.

58:45.259 --> 58:46.694
Maria's taking too long.

58:53.701 --> 58:55.002
I'll go and find her.

59:04.612 --> 59:05.613
What's wrong?

59:14.355 --> 59:15.689
I don't like it here.

59:51.692 --> 59:53.928
Maria! Maria!

59:55.262 --> 59:57.698
Come back! Maria!

59:58.132 --> 1:00:00.267
Maria! Oh!

1:00:00.901 --> 1:00:03.804
Maria! Don't leave me here!

1:00:04.305 --> 1:00:05.306
Skank!

1:00:09.777 --> 1:00:10.778
Ugh!

1:00:38.906 --> 1:00:39.907
She's gone.

1:00:54.388 --> 1:00:57.992
Cherry, are you
seeing things again?

1:01:15.209 --> 1:01:16.477
Where were you?

1:01:16.511 --> 1:01:18.245
In the woods,
looking for Maria.

1:01:18.279 --> 1:01:19.280
She split.

1:01:20.247 --> 1:01:22.082
I want to leave... now.

1:01:51.011 --> 1:01:54.048
It's Maria. Stop.
Stop the car.

1:01:54.081 --> 1:01:55.849
Stop the car!
What are you doing?

1:01:55.883 --> 1:01:57.451
Stop the car!
It's Maria!

1:01:57.484 --> 1:01:59.119
Stop! Stop!

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:03.257
Maria!

1:02:57.878 --> 1:02:59.246
It's not real.

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:00.447
It's all in my head.

1:03:02.082 --> 1:03:03.851
It's not real,
it's all my head!

1:03:05.185 --> 1:03:07.121
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:08.389 --> 1:03:10.057
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:10.090 --> 1:03:11.325
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:11.358 --> 1:03:12.493
It's not...

1:03:12.527 --> 1:03:14.228
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:16.030 --> 1:03:18.132
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:21.435 --> 1:03:22.469
It's all in my head.

1:03:25.906 --> 1:03:27.207
It's all in my head.

1:03:29.076 --> 1:03:31.011
It's not real,
it's all my head.

1:03:37.351 --> 1:03:38.819
No, it is.

1:07:42.664 --> 1:07:43.665
Cherry.

1:08:04.719 --> 1:08:05.720
Cherry.

1:08:27.742 --> 1:08:28.743
Cherry.

1:08:41.488 --> 1:08:42.523
Cherry.

1:08:42.557 --> 1:08:43.691
Cherry!

1:08:49.764 --> 1:08:50.798
Cherry.

1:10:08.475 --> 1:10:09.476
No!

1:10:10.277 --> 1:10:11.278
No!

1:10:37.972 --> 1:10:38.973
Dwayne.

1:10:42.643 --> 1:10:43.644
Dwayne.

1:10:48.649 --> 1:10:49.650
Dwayne!

1:10:52.385 --> 1:10:53.554
Dwayne!

1:10:53.988 --> 1:10:55.355
Dwayne.

1:10:55.388 --> 1:10:56.389
Dwayne.

1:10:58.025 --> 1:10:59.026
Dwayne.

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:00.661
Dwayne.

1:11:07.835 --> 1:11:08.836
Dwayne.

1:11:55.850 --> 1:11:57.718
It's a blade.
It's a blade.

1:12:08.863 --> 1:12:09.864
Dwayne.

1:12:11.532 --> 1:12:12.667
Dwayne!

1:12:14.001 --> 1:12:15.502
Dwayne, are you here?

1:12:17.004 --> 1:12:18.005
Dwayne.

1:15:30.331 --> 1:15:33.300
No! No! No! No!

1:15:42.610 --> 1:15:43.611
No!

1:15:56.023 --> 1:15:57.691
No! No!

1:16:30.658 --> 1:16:32.193
Why are you
all doing this?

1:17:14.468 --> 1:17:15.669
Cherry.

1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:20.241
Cherry!

1:18:23.103 --> 1:18:24.405
Dwayne.

1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:47.861
You let it happen.

1:18:51.498 --> 1:18:52.733
All of it!

1:19:23.030 --> 1:19:24.164
Remember your place.

1:20:14.014 --> 1:20:16.483
She is in the forest.

1:20:54.922 --> 1:20:58.492
You belong here.

1:21:01.228 --> 1:21:04.098
<i>You belong here.</i>

1:21:06.233 --> 1:21:10.104
<i>You belong here.</i>

1:21:18.979 --> 1:21:20.114
Cherry!

1:21:33.994 --> 1:21:34.995
Cherry!

1:21:55.683 --> 1:21:56.684
Cherry!

1:21:59.319 --> 1:22:02.256
You belong here.

1:22:02.289 --> 1:22:04.526
<i>You belong here.</i>

1:24:03.410 --> 1:24:04.411
Cherry!

1:24:28.536 --> 1:24:29.537
I'm leaving.

1:24:32.239 --> 1:24:33.508
Come with me. Come.

1:24:43.183 --> 1:24:44.284
I can't.
