[TONY] Yeah, yeah. We all know
about you and your superior tech.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.189
Yes, Your Highness.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.309
There were many witnesses.

04:25.410 --> 04:27.119
It was a horrible beast.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.659
A Kawulo.

04:28.660 --> 04:31.289
Howl? I'd say
more of a roar.

04:31.290 --> 04:32.739
And it had these wings.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.869
Wings? No.
They were claws!

04:35.870 --> 04:37.949
With this thick fur.

04:37.950 --> 04:39.659
Fangs. Huge fangs.

Yes, Your Highness.
Of course.

05:33.330 --> 05:35.619

05:35.620 --> 05:38.419
<i>Someone with experience
needed to investigate.</i>

05:38.660 --> 05:42.499
This village is too remote to make
an effective military target.
