WEBVTT

01:26.037 --> 01:27.629
Are you sure you don't want me to wait?

01:27.706 --> 01:29.230
While you run up the meter?

01:29.307 --> 01:31.366
<i>Good night, sweet prince.</i>

02:48.687 --> 02:50.780
<i>It's always the little mistakes</i>

02:50.855 --> 02:52.447
<i>that catch you up short in life.</i>

02:52.524 --> 02:55.084
<i>Just when you think your life
is running along smoothly,</i>

02:55.160 --> 02:57.685
<i>everything in place, the
little mistakes start happening.</i>

02:57.762 --> 03:01.129
<i>Like you cut yourself shaving
and bleed all over your shirt.</i>

03:01.199 --> 03:03.190
<i>Or you lose your car keys
and you're 20 minutes late</i>

03:03.268 --> 03:05.702
<i>to a date you've really
been looking forward to.</i>

03:05.770 --> 03:09.001
<i>Or, you overlook a tiny, little
notice that comes in the mail,</i>

03:09.074 --> 03:10.735
<i>and wake up
one morning to discover</i>

03:10.809 --> 03:13.471
<i>your private investigator's
license has expired.</i>

03:13.545 --> 03:14.773
<i>Little mistakes.</i>

03:14.846 --> 03:17.246
That'll be $2.50.

03:17.315 --> 03:19.840
Can I help somebody over here?

03:23.421 --> 03:25.150
Ow!

03:25.223 --> 03:27.054
What are you doing to my dog?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.752
Me? Nothing.

03:29.294 --> 03:32.161
<i>Well, why don't you pick
on someone your own size?</i>

03:32.597 --> 03:34.258
<i>Come along, Bruno.</i>

03:35.467 --> 03:37.935
<i>Sorry, I'm closed. You'll
have to go to the other window.</i>

03:38.003 --> 03:39.937
What? Wait.

03:51.082 --> 03:53.141
<i>Hey, no line crashing.</i>

03:54.552 --> 03:56.543
I've been here awhile.

03:57.355 --> 03:59.653
Are you here to get
your marriage license?

03:59.724 --> 04:00.713
No.

04:01.660 --> 04:02.854
We are.

04:03.628 --> 04:05.755
<i>Oh, congratulations.</i>

04:05.930 --> 04:08.296
And I've only got 12 hours
shore leave. I didn't know that.

04:08.366 --> 04:11.199
That's why I don't
appreciate line crashers.

04:11.970 --> 04:15.133
<i>Well, I'm sure they'll
just rush you right through.</i>

04:15.640 --> 04:18.939
<i>See, Herbie, I told you
there's nothing to it.</i>

04:19.244 --> 04:21.303
There better not be.

04:22.247 --> 04:25.239
<i>Hey, you think you could
hurry it up, up there?</i>

04:28.153 --> 04:31.611
<i>Jonathan, I can't hold
the ladies off much longer.</i>

04:32.390 --> 04:34.881
What am I going to do
without a Robert Browning?

04:34.959 --> 04:37.951
I must say in all honesty
that this is atypical behavior.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.930
<i>Unless, Jonathan, you... Which,
you may recall, I warned you about</i>

04:40.999 --> 04:43.194
when you approached Magnum
in the first place.

04:43.268 --> 04:46.931
It does seem to have a certain
poetic symmetry about it.

04:47.238 --> 04:51.197
<i>Me as Miss Barrett,
you as Mr. Browning.</i>

04:51.710 --> 04:53.200
What on earth
are you talking about?

04:53.278 --> 04:55.576
You could take
Mr. Magnum's place

04:55.647 --> 04:57.410
as our guest reader.

04:57.515 --> 05:01.178
<i>Well, Agatha, naturally,
I'd be honored, but I...</i>

05:01.252 --> 05:03.447
<i>Oh, Jonathan.</i>

05:04.055 --> 05:06.285
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

05:06.358 --> 05:09.191
I'm certain Magnum
will be here any minute.

05:10.061 --> 05:15.124
<i>Oh, baby, I just can't wait
to be Mrs. Herbie Fosdick.</i>

05:16.501 --> 05:19.698
<i>Me, too, Sugar.
Me, too.</i>

05:20.939 --> 05:23.237
You wanna keep this line moving?

05:24.142 --> 05:27.134
<i>Hi, look, I've got
a little problem.</i>

05:27.212 --> 05:29.407
A slight oversight on my part.

05:29.514 --> 05:30.879
Your license has expired.

05:30.949 --> 05:32.348
<i>Yeah, I know,
I was wondering if...</i>

05:32.417 --> 05:35.352
<i>Fill out this application. Bring it
back with two character references,</i>

05:35.420 --> 05:36.546
Hawaii residents only.

05:36.621 --> 05:38.987
You can take the written
exam next week. Next week?

05:39.057 --> 05:41.582
<i>If you pass that,
we'll set up the interview.</i>

05:41.659 --> 05:43.286
Next.
No. Wait.

05:43.361 --> 05:45.921
You don't understand... I
understand your license has expired.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.727
<i>Yes, but... And that there
are other people in line.</i>

05:48.800 --> 05:51.268
<i>Yes, I always get
my new license by the mail.</i>

05:51.336 --> 05:54.237
That's if you sent in your
money before it expired.

05:54.348 --> 05:56.282
<i>But I have the money,
look whatever it takes.</i>

05:56.307 --> 05:58.400
<i>If there's a fine,
or other expenses...</i>

05:58.476 --> 06:00.569
Are you trying to bribe me?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.546
<i>No.
Well, you slime.</i>

06:03.614 --> 06:05.081
Trying to bribe
a government official.

06:05.149 --> 06:06.446
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

06:06.517 --> 06:09.145
<i>Oh, now come on,
I don't want to fight you.</i>

06:13.558 --> 06:14.752
<i>Come on now, lady.</i>

06:14.826 --> 06:17.590
"I love thee with a love I seemed to lose"

06:17.662 --> 06:20.927
<i>"with my lost saints,
I love thee with the breath,"</i>

06:20.998 --> 06:23.489
<i>"smiles and tears
of all my life,"</i>

06:23.868 --> 06:28.328
<i>"and, if God choose, I shall but
love thee better after death."</i>

06:31.676 --> 06:34.236
<i>"That second time they
hunted me, from hill to plain,"</i>

06:34.312 --> 06:36.507
"from shore to sea..."

06:44.388 --> 06:46.413
<i>Excuse me, Agatha.</i>

06:47.892 --> 06:49.291
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

06:51.495 --> 06:55.295
You're just lucky I happened to
be in the building. Here sign.

06:55.366 --> 06:58.358
Whatever possessed you to start
a fight in a government building?

06:58.436 --> 07:00.301
I didn't start it. This...

07:00.872 --> 07:02.464
That's a long story.

07:02.540 --> 07:04.303
<i>What were you
doing there, anyway?</i>

07:04.375 --> 07:06.104
Getting my fishing
license renewed.

07:06.177 --> 07:08.202
What were you doing there?

07:09.080 --> 07:11.571
<i>Visiting a friend.
Thanks, again, Lieutenant.</i>

07:11.649 --> 07:14.846
<i>Hey, hey, you don't
want to forget this.</i>

07:14.919 --> 07:16.443
Your application form.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.183
<i>You wouldn't plan on practicing
without a license, would you, now?</i>

07:21.058 --> 07:22.548
Of course not.

07:25.796 --> 07:27.423
Thanks.

07:33.471 --> 07:36.201
<i>Okay, so I was going to
have to spend a few days</i>

07:36.274 --> 07:37.901
<i>getting my license restored.</i>

07:37.975 --> 07:39.909
<i>It wasn't the worst thing
that could have happened.</i>

07:39.977 --> 07:43.105
<i>And getting a couple of character
references would be easy.</i>

07:43.180 --> 07:46.172
<i>I knew Rick and T.C. Or Higgins
would come through for me.</i>

07:46.250 --> 07:47.979
<i>Or Carol.</i>

07:48.152 --> 07:49.983
<i>At least I didn't really
have anything else</i>

07:50.054 --> 07:51.783
<i>I had to do at the moment.</i>

07:53.457 --> 07:55.448
<i>Magnum, how could you?
What?</i>

07:55.526 --> 07:57.255
<i>No need for a reprimand,
Jonathan.</i>

07:57.328 --> 07:59.762
<i>I can see why Mr. Magnum
would forget the reading,</i>

07:59.830 --> 08:01.923
what with all the excitement and everything.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.331
The reading?
Robert Browning.

08:04.402 --> 08:06.131
You offered to read
Robert Browning

08:06.203 --> 08:07.898
for the
Anglo-Hawaiian Society

08:07.972 --> 08:10.497
for the Preservation
of the English Language.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.939
I sent the book over.

08:12.009 --> 08:15.536
You wanted me to read it? I thought
you just wanted me to read it.

08:15.613 --> 08:16.875
<i>You know, not out loud.</i>

08:16.948 --> 08:19.314
Why didn't you tell anyone?
What was there to tell?

08:19.383 --> 08:20.782
It's a simple misunderstanding.

08:20.851 --> 08:23.183
I have nothing prepared.
No special menus lined up.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.585
No flowers in the guest bedroom.

08:24.655 --> 08:26.213
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

08:26.290 --> 08:28.554
<i>Why, the arrival of Miss Sullivan. Of course.</i>

08:28.626 --> 08:31.424
<i>Miss Sullivan? Pulitzer
Prize winning playwright,</i>

08:31.495 --> 08:33.053
<i>Miss Phoebe Sullivan,</i>

08:33.130 --> 08:34.927
who's making some ridiculous
claim about being...

08:34.999 --> 08:36.693
My Aunt Phoebe?
Tommy?

08:36.767 --> 08:38.131
Aunt Phoebe!

08:38.202 --> 08:42.934
<i>Mr. Higgins, there's another long
distance call for Miss Sullivan.</i>

08:43.006 --> 08:46.101
<i>Oh, you haven't changed a bit.</i>

08:46.377 --> 08:48.208
A Mr. Hal Prince
from New York.

08:48.279 --> 08:51.112
<i>Oh, can't they ever
leave me alone?</i>

08:51.649 --> 08:52.843
Who's...

08:52.917 --> 08:54.544
Keo is visiting
her sister on Maui.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.280
Lani is from the Niu Valley
Temporary Domestic Agency.

08:57.355 --> 09:00.119
Would you be a darling
and tell him I have run off

09:00.191 --> 09:03.422
with an astonishingly
handsome young man.

09:03.494 --> 09:06.520
And you haven't the slightest
idea when I'll return. If ever.

09:06.597 --> 09:10.590
<i>Come along, Tommy. We don't want to
make a liar out of your Mr. Higgins.</i>

09:10.668 --> 09:11.965
He's not my Mr. Higgins.

09:12.036 --> 09:14.869
Do you buy those shirts
at a regular store? What?

09:14.939 --> 09:17.669
Isn't she wonderful?

09:19.577 --> 09:23.138
<i>Oh, this is the life, isn't it?</i>

09:23.647 --> 09:26.377
<i>The sky, the sand and the sea.</i>

09:26.984 --> 09:28.952
<i>The moon, the stars,
we got it all.</i>

09:29.220 --> 09:30.448
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

09:30.554 --> 09:33.990
<i>Why would any woman want to
pursue a life of wealth and fame,</i>

09:34.058 --> 09:37.118
<i>when you can lead such a
simple, happy life here?</i>

09:37.194 --> 09:38.525
I thought you were in Europe.

09:39.997 --> 09:43.489
<i>Remember when I took you
to the Folies Berger?</i>

09:43.968 --> 09:45.731
That's not something you forget.

09:45.803 --> 09:47.737
How old were you?
Twelve.

09:48.239 --> 09:51.037
I thought your mother
was going to skin me alive.

09:51.108 --> 09:55.135
<i>Well, that wasn't exactly my
mom's idea of French culture.</i>

09:55.212 --> 09:58.807
Katherine was always
a bit rigid.

10:00.117 --> 10:03.280
That was the best trip
I had to Europe. Ever.

10:03.387 --> 10:05.947
<i>You know, I always thought,
with your vivid imagination,</i>

10:06.023 --> 10:09.618
you'd end up working for the
CIA or the French Foreign Legion.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.151
<i>I even secretly fancied you
might follow in my path,</i>

10:13.798 --> 10:15.857
write a famous novel.

10:17.134 --> 10:20.331
<i>You know, some people have
been a little worried about you.</i>

10:20.404 --> 10:22.099
No one's heard
from you in months.

10:22.173 --> 10:25.233
I needed seclusion.
You know how popular I am.

10:25.309 --> 10:27.539
People won't leave me alone.

10:27.611 --> 10:32.344
And I've been working
on something very important.

10:33.317 --> 10:36.081
Yeah?
I've written a new play.

10:36.153 --> 10:39.145
<i>Well, that's great. That
explains the call from Hal Prince.</i>

10:39.223 --> 10:40.485
What?

10:40.558 --> 10:43.425
<i>The guy, the call you
just got from New York.</i>

10:43.494 --> 10:46.657
It's going to be a huge success.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.028
I told my agent
to make a few calls.

10:49.100 --> 10:51.500
<i>People are already bidding
on it, sight unseen.</i>

10:51.569 --> 10:54.629
So you came here to make
it harder to reach you

10:54.705 --> 10:56.332
and drive up the price.

10:56.407 --> 10:59.171
<i>Good heavens, no.
I came to ask for your help.</i>

10:59.243 --> 11:01.040
Someone is trying to murder me.

11:01.779 --> 11:05.340
Mr. Magnum. Miss Sullivan.
Tea is served.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.740
<i>My Aunt Phoebe was the
smartest woman I ever knew.</i>

11:15.810 --> 11:19.211
<i>She also had a tendency to
see things bigger than life.</i>

11:19.280 --> 11:22.738
<i>Which meant that when you were with
her you got to see more vibrant colors,</i>

11:22.817 --> 11:27.845
<i>hear more intriguing sounds, feel
things more fully than when she was gone.</i>

11:27.922 --> 11:30.618
<i>But it also meant that you
sometimes had to translate</i>

11:30.691 --> 11:34.218
<i>her view of the world
into a more mundane reality.</i>

11:34.295 --> 11:36.320
<i>I've never quite got
a good look at him,</i>

11:36.397 --> 11:37.921
but I know he's been
following me

11:37.999 --> 11:39.694
<i>ever since I got back
to New York,</i>

11:40.201 --> 11:44.001
I am convinced he broke into my
brownstone last week and then...

11:45.139 --> 11:46.766
Then he tipped his hand.

11:46.841 --> 11:50.743
My secretary gave me a message that
I was to meet with George and Nellie.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.574
You remember George and Nellie?

11:52.646 --> 11:55.547
Vaguely. I was to meet with George and Nellie

11:55.616 --> 11:58.983
at the David Garrick Theater
at 11:00 that night.

11:59.053 --> 12:01.351
<i>Well, naturally, I didn't
think anything about it.</i>

12:01.422 --> 12:03.447
I assumed they were
appearing there.

12:03.524 --> 12:06.049
<i>After all, I'd been out
of the country.</i>

12:06.694 --> 12:10.255
<i>I don't quite understand how this,
"tipped his hand," as you put it.</i>

12:10.331 --> 12:12.196
<i>When I got to the theater,
no one was there.</i>

12:12.266 --> 12:13.733
The place was all chained up.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.395
There was never a call
from George and Nellie.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.967
And then he showed up.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.974
The man who's been stalking me.

12:21.042 --> 12:22.976
<i>Murder Came Knocking.
Yes.</i>

12:23.077 --> 12:26.638
Exactly. And do you
remember how that play ended?

12:26.714 --> 12:30.616
<i>With the murder of the
attractive, charming, successful,</i>

12:31.152 --> 12:33.279
but somewhat naive
Ginny Dockworth.

12:33.354 --> 12:37.256
<i>A character fashioned loosely
upon myself. Aunt Phoebe,</i>

12:37.725 --> 12:39.920
you were never somewhat naive.

12:39.994 --> 12:41.928
<i>Well, I know I'm not
Ginny Dockworth.</i>

12:41.996 --> 12:44.430
But apparently
this madman doesn't.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.825
If what you say is true...
It is.

12:46.901 --> 12:49.199
And he has followed me
here to Hawaii.

12:49.804 --> 12:52.534
Aunt Phoebe...
A car followed my limo

12:52.606 --> 12:55.074
all the way from
the airport to your place.

12:55.309 --> 12:57.971
<i>Don't you find that odd?
Well, yeah.</i>

12:58.045 --> 12:59.307
Are you sure?

12:59.380 --> 13:01.871
This is his
license plate number.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.474
The limo driver wrote it down.

13:05.319 --> 13:09.756
<i>Agatha Chumley. Miss Sullivan,
I hope I'm not imposing.</i>

13:09.857 --> 13:12.917
<i>I... Oh, Jonathan.
Tea time already?</i>

13:12.993 --> 13:14.824
<i>Yes, please, join us, Agatha.</i>

13:14.895 --> 13:17.864
<i>Oh, no, no. I just popped back
with my portfolio.</i>

13:17.932 --> 13:20.366
<i>Miss Sullivan, you and I
discussed it earlier.</i>

13:20.434 --> 13:22.095
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:22.169 --> 13:24.160
<i>I haven't had a great deal
of professional experience,</i>

13:25.306 --> 13:27.501
Although I did perform
in a pantomime

13:27.575 --> 13:30.043
at the Blackpool Music Hall
as a child.

13:30.111 --> 13:32.341
Cinderella.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.378
I'm sure you were smashing.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.877
I thought these photos of
some of my amateur productions

13:38.953 --> 13:42.389
might give you
an idea of my range.

13:43.324 --> 13:44.985
Mr. Dennis Parker.

13:45.159 --> 13:48.925
Phoebe. Darling. Dennis. Dennis Parker.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.396
<i>My God, it's been
a million years.</i>

13:51.565 --> 13:54.864
I can't believe it. You're
actually here in Honolulu.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.369
<i>But I'm devastated,
darling, you didn't ring me.</i>

13:57.438 --> 13:58.837
I only just arrived.

13:58.939 --> 14:02.636
<i>Well, I'm forever indebted to Agatha
for letting me know you were here.</i>

14:03.911 --> 14:05.071
<i>Dennis, I'm so sorry.</i>

14:05.146 --> 14:07.637
<i>Have you met my nephew,
Tommy Magnum?</i>

14:08.048 --> 14:09.515
<i>Well, hello, Tommy.</i>

14:09.583 --> 14:12.211
I believe we've met.
I think Phoebe brought you

14:12.286 --> 14:15.551
to the opening of one of
my plays in New York. Yes.

14:15.623 --> 14:18.319
<i>The opening of your only play
in New York, I believe, darling.</i>

14:18.392 --> 14:20.155
And you've met Jonathan Higgins.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.525
I'm acquainted
with Mr. Parker's work.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.928
And of course you know...
Agatha.

14:24.999 --> 14:27.433
<i>I didn't expect
to see you, Dennis.</i>

14:28.369 --> 14:30.599
Tea?
A splendid idea.

14:30.671 --> 14:32.639
<i>Thank you very much.
Oh, yes.</i>

14:34.275 --> 14:37.039
<i>Darling, the drums
are beating out a message,</i>

14:37.111 --> 14:39.306
You have a new opus.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.773
How do these things
get out so fast?

14:42.850 --> 14:45.785
<i>This was our most recent
production of The Mikado.</i>

14:45.853 --> 14:48.048
I know it's hard to tell
that's me in the makeup.

14:48.122 --> 14:50.556
<i>Mr. Higgins, a call
for Miss Sullivan.</i>

14:50.624 --> 14:53.149
Says he's from
the Shubert Organization.

14:53.227 --> 14:56.993
<i>Oh, would you tell them
I'm tied up in meetings.</i>

14:57.097 --> 14:59.258
That should up the price
right off the bat.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.496
<i>Aunt Phoebe, you can't ask
Higgins to take all your messages.</i>

15:02.570 --> 15:06.404
<i>He's not your servant.
Well, I'm sorry.</i>

15:06.473 --> 15:08.964
I'm sure he doesn't mind.
Not at all.

15:09.043 --> 15:11.170
<i>Incidentally, Miss Sullivan,
on behalf of Mr. Masters,</i>

15:11.245 --> 15:13.509
I'd like to extend the
invitation for you to stay with us

15:13.581 --> 15:15.776
as long as you like.
Thank you.

15:15.849 --> 15:20.616
<i>Phoebe, I've just had the most incredible idea.
This was a few years ago. The musical, Oliver!</i>

15:25.693 --> 15:28.491
<i>Well, let's put them
on the piano.</i>

15:31.265 --> 15:35.292
"Don't make any deals until
you've spoken to me. Joe Papp."

15:35.803 --> 15:38.670
Wouldn't you think they could
make attractive arrangements

15:38.739 --> 15:41.503
when they grow such beautiful flowers here.

15:41.575 --> 15:42.940
<i>Darling, listen,</i>

15:43.010 --> 15:46.844
I have an idea. Why don't you
premiere your new opus here.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.548
<i>Oh, Denny, what a quaint idea.</i>

15:49.617 --> 15:53.383
<i>Darling, I'm serious. Listen, I'm guest
director of the Hawaii Theater Center.</i>

15:53.454 --> 15:55.115
You've no doubt heard of it.

15:55.189 --> 15:58.386
<i>And this is
A Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

15:58.459 --> 15:59.790
I played Blanche.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.418
<i>I'd love to talk to you about it, darling.</i>

16:01.495 --> 16:04.896
But my nephew and I have some urgent
business to attend to right now.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.627
<i>You do understand? Well, look,
darling. Here, take my card</i>

16:07.701 --> 16:08.929
<i>at least, will you?
And drop by.</i>

16:10.104 --> 16:11.264
<i>Well, Agatha.</i>

16:12.973 --> 16:15.533
And Tommy.
Thomas.

16:15.676 --> 16:20.113
<i>Of course, Thomas.
Well, cheerio.</i>

16:24.151 --> 16:27.643
<i>Well, can you find this man
who is planning to murder me.</i>

16:27.888 --> 16:32.757
"I have always depended
on the kindness of strangers."

16:39.099 --> 16:43.365
How could you let your license
expire? It just slipped my mind.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.566
<i>Well, going to the bank,
slips your mind.</i>

16:45.639 --> 16:47.573
<i>Writing home, slips your mind.</i>

16:47.641 --> 16:49.472
Renewing your private investigator's license

16:49.543 --> 16:50.737
does not slip your mind.

16:50.811 --> 16:53.405
<i>T. C., you're making a big deal
out of a very little mistake.</i>

16:53.480 --> 16:56.210
It doesn't do any good to
go on and on and on about it.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.910
What I need right
now is a reference.

16:57.985 --> 17:00.818
I need a recommendation
from somebody like you.

17:00.888 --> 17:03.652
<i>An upstanding citizen,
a pillar of the community.</i>

17:03.724 --> 17:06.557
<i>So, how come you didn't
ask me to do it?</i>

17:10.064 --> 17:11.291
<i>I was going to, Rick,</i>

17:11.365 --> 17:14.027
but you've done so many
nice things for me lately.

17:14.101 --> 17:17.036
<i>Yeah, okay, okay, okay,
what am I supposed to say?</i>

17:17.838 --> 17:19.635
What you honestly feel.

17:19.707 --> 17:21.834
<i>Well, you know what those
examiners like to see.</i>

17:21.909 --> 17:25.345
<i>Like, how you're the kind of
guy that always pays his debts.</i>

17:25.412 --> 17:26.606
<i>Yeah, something like that.</i>

17:26.680 --> 17:31.674
The kind of guy who would never drag
a citizen into a dangerous situation.

17:31.752 --> 17:33.083
Not unless it's
absolutely necessary.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.314
<i>The kind of guy who would
never use his friends,</i>

17:35.389 --> 17:39.189
who are not licensed private
investigators to do all of his footwork.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.726
I don't do that.

17:40.794 --> 17:43.058
<i>Hey, I got a make
on that license plate.</i>

17:43.130 --> 17:47.829
<i>DBO 527 is registered to Ace One
Car Rental agency. Thanks, Rick.</i>

17:50.938 --> 17:54.101
<i>T.C. All right, all right,
all right. I'll do it.</i>

17:54.174 --> 17:56.165
But you're gonna have to
give me a couple of days.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.041
This is going to take
some very creative writing.

17:59.113 --> 18:01.809
<i>Thanks, T.C.</i>

18:03.083 --> 18:05.017
<i>You know I can't give
any information like that.</i>

18:05.085 --> 18:07.280
<i>Look, all I need
is the name of a guy</i>

18:07.354 --> 18:10.448
who rented a car with
the license plate DBO 527.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.752
Are you a cop?

18:11.825 --> 18:16.455
No. I'm a private
investigator. Here's my card.

18:18.232 --> 18:20.666
Everybody's
a private investigator.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.636
<i>This license is expired. Well, yeah,
I know. The new one's in the mail.</i>

18:29.710 --> 18:32.804
<i>See, I have a client
and he rented that car</i>

18:32.880 --> 18:36.008
last week and he thinks he
left something valuable in it.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.448
What's your client's name?

18:37.518 --> 18:40.715
<i>I can't tell you that,
client confidentiality.</i>

18:42.389 --> 18:44.448
<i>I'm very busy here,
Mr. Magnum.</i>

18:44.525 --> 18:46.823
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.772
Mr. Masters' estate.

19:00.841 --> 19:01.899
<i>Hi, Higgins.</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:03.340
<i>Oh, Magnum. It's you.</i>

19:03.410 --> 19:04.900
Could I talk to Aunt Phoebe?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.843
<i>No, you can't, hold on.</i>

19:06.914 --> 19:09.178
<i>Robin Masters' estate,
please hold.</i>

19:09.249 --> 19:10.876
<i>I'm afraid I can't
help you, Magnum.</i>

19:10.951 --> 19:14.182
<i>Oh, come on, Higgins. She'll talk
to me. I'm not some famous producer.</i>

19:14.254 --> 19:17.746
<i>Be that as it may, you can't
talk to her. She isn't here.</i>

19:17.825 --> 19:20.726
<i>Where is she?
I haven't the slightest idea.</i>

19:20.794 --> 19:23.695
After she finished giving orders
about rearranging the furniture

19:23.764 --> 19:25.755
<i>in the living room,
the study and her room,</i>

19:25.833 --> 19:28.324
<i>and completely changing the
week's menus with the cook,</i>

19:28.402 --> 19:31.428
she informed me that she was
borrowing my car to go visit a friend.

19:31.505 --> 19:32.938
<i>Higgins,
how could you let her leave?</i>

19:33.006 --> 19:35.338
What if what she said about
somebody following her is true?

19:35.409 --> 19:38.640
<i>Did you ever try giving
advice to your Aunt Phoebe?</i>

19:38.712 --> 19:41.237
How long do you think she'll
be gracing us with her presence?

19:41.849 --> 19:43.714
<i>Oh, that's hard to say.</i>

19:43.784 --> 19:46.582
She's been known to stay a month
or two if she likes the company.

19:46.687 --> 19:47.847
A month?

19:47.921 --> 19:52.255
Or two. And so far she seems
to be having a great time.

19:53.994 --> 19:55.461
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

20:02.536 --> 20:04.970
LANI:
Robin Master's Estate...

20:40.140 --> 20:42.973
<i>What the hell
are you doing, lady?</i>

20:45.045 --> 20:47.707
<i>Back up!
Come on, move it!</i>

20:47.881 --> 20:50.907
What are you doing?
You can't park there.

20:51.018 --> 20:52.508
Move back the other way!

20:52.586 --> 20:54.213
<i>Come on, lady. Move that car!</i>

20:55.522 --> 20:57.922
<i>Come on, lady, I'm late for work! Back up!</i>

20:57.991 --> 20:59.720
<i>Oh, brother!
Hey, where are you going?</i>

21:00.394 --> 21:03.192
Shut the door!
Can't park there!

21:05.832 --> 21:07.026
Hey!

21:10.504 --> 21:13.405
<i>Come on, get back in the
car and move it, will you?</i>

21:13.974 --> 21:16.875
<i>What's the matter with you?
Come on.</i>

21:56.316 --> 21:57.578
Coming.

22:00.721 --> 22:06.216
<i>Hello. Yes, she's staying here,
but she's out at the moment.</i>

22:10.964 --> 22:12.397
I'll be right there.

22:25.412 --> 22:28.108
<i>Oh, Sully. You're here.</i>

22:29.750 --> 22:32.981
Are you okay?
Did I call you Sully?

22:33.086 --> 22:34.519
Yeah.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.418
<i>Well, there is a strong
family resemblance.</i>

22:39.493 --> 22:42.053
Anyone ever tell you you
look like your Uncle Sully?

22:42.129 --> 22:46.293
<i>They used to. It doesn't
matter how long someone's gone,</i>

22:47.534 --> 22:51.265
you still miss them
like they just left yesterday.

22:51.338 --> 22:52.930
What happened?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.566
I stopped at a theater.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.547
I guess it must have
been the wrong one.

23:02.249 --> 23:03.614
Mr. Magnum.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.089
We've notified the police.

23:10.157 --> 23:12.148
<i>Apparently, she was mugged
and knocked down.</i>

23:12.225 --> 23:13.556
<i>Now physically, she's all right.</i>

23:13.627 --> 23:18.189
<i>Just a few contusions, but
she seems a little disoriented.</i>

23:19.266 --> 23:20.460
Thanks.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.395
He stole my play.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.702
The man who's been following me.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.071
He wasn't planning to murder me.

23:29.543 --> 23:31.773
He wanted to steal my play.

23:40.654 --> 23:43.487
I told you the dresser
is to go against the wall

23:43.557 --> 23:45.388
and my bed is supposed
to be by the window.

23:45.459 --> 23:48.917
I can't write unless my bed
is by the window.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.190
But that's where I moved
it before and you said...

23:51.264 --> 23:53.892
<i>That's all right, Lani.
I'll take care of it.</i>

23:58.972 --> 24:03.773
<i>Oh, sometimes I despair if we'll
ever get this place fixed up right.</i>

24:05.078 --> 24:07.103
Who were you going to see?

24:08.148 --> 24:09.706
What do you mean? When?

24:09.783 --> 24:12.251
When you got lost.
When you got mugged.

24:12.319 --> 24:14.184
You told Higgins you were
going to see a friend.

24:14.321 --> 24:15.583
Oh.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.923
<i>Dennis, I suppose.</i>

24:17.991 --> 24:20.983
You suppose? Dennis. I
was going to see Dennis.

24:21.061 --> 24:24.292
<i>Good heavens, if this is
how you run an investigation,</i>

24:24.364 --> 24:26.195
it's no wonder you're
not working for the CIA.

24:26.266 --> 24:29.929
You're supposed to interrogate
the suspects not the client.

24:37.978 --> 24:40.378
Sully never liked
this side of me.

24:41.414 --> 24:44.076
<i>Crabapple, he called me.</i>

24:49.723 --> 24:52.817
<i>Do you remember,
when Murder Came Knocking</i>

24:52.893 --> 24:57.125
<i>opened in New York, and you and
I sat up all night at Sardi's</i>

24:57.197 --> 24:59.529
waiting for the reviews
to come in?

24:59.599 --> 25:03.558
Dennis Parker thought I was
going to fall flat on my face.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.004
<i>But the reviews
were all glowing,</i>

25:09.543 --> 25:11.408
except for that one...

25:11.845 --> 25:13.608
<i>Oh, what was his name?</i>

25:13.680 --> 25:15.545
<i>The critic for Act One.</i>

25:18.618 --> 25:20.609
<i>Oh, it was wonderful.</i>

25:39.472 --> 25:41.736
I'll come get you for dinner.

26:18.245 --> 26:20.679
I think I liked it better
the other way.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.613
Yes.

26:23.216 --> 26:25.013
<i>Well, perhaps it is a good idea</i>

26:25.085 --> 26:26.575
to shake everything up
once in a while

26:26.653 --> 26:28.848
<i>to avoid getting into a rut,</i>

26:28.922 --> 26:30.116
if you see what I mean.

26:30.190 --> 26:33.523
Sounds like something
my Aunt Phoebe said.

26:35.829 --> 26:38.161
I trust
she's resting comfortably.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.096
I guess.

26:45.405 --> 26:47.430
Let me ask you
a hypothetical question.

26:47.507 --> 26:51.136
The kind of question one might find
on a private investigator's exam?

26:51.211 --> 26:52.439
Exactly.

26:52.579 --> 26:56.242
<i>Suppose you were a famous
composer, for instance,</i>

26:56.316 --> 26:59.649
and you hadn't written
any symphonies or operas

26:59.719 --> 27:02.415
or anything like that
for several years.

27:03.423 --> 27:06.881
And suppose you told everyone

27:06.960 --> 27:11.192
<i>you'd just finished something
really very spectacular,</i>

27:11.998 --> 27:14.796
only you didn't finish it
for some reason.

27:14.868 --> 27:17.996
<i>Writer's block, for example?
Yeah. Say, writer's block,</i>

27:18.071 --> 27:19.834
you just...
You couldn't finish it

27:19.906 --> 27:24.070
and everyone was expecting to see
it and there was all this pressure.

27:25.045 --> 27:26.706
What would you do?

27:29.316 --> 27:31.614
There is another way
to look at this.

27:31.685 --> 27:33.983
Another hypothetical.
Precisely.

27:34.187 --> 27:37.122
<i>Suppose you had been in retirement
for some time and you had, indeed,</i>

27:37.190 --> 27:39.317
written something quite...
What was the word?

27:39.392 --> 27:41.121
Spectacular.
Quite.

27:41.328 --> 27:45.321
But you were afraid it might get lost
in the rush of other compositions.

27:45.398 --> 27:49.425
And you knew that with some
unusual publicity gimmick

27:49.936 --> 27:52.700
you might get it the attention
it so richly deserved.

27:54.774 --> 27:55.763
Hmm.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.545
<i>Or, she could be
telling the truth.</i>

28:01.581 --> 28:03.208
I have to assume she is.

28:06.353 --> 28:10.084
I think I'll pay a visit to an
old friend with a motive for theft.

28:10.323 --> 28:12.120
<i>Oh, the phones?</i>

28:13.760 --> 28:16.695
<i>Oh, I disconnected them.
Temporarily.</i>

28:16.763 --> 28:19.357
It does make it
more peaceful somehow.

28:29.009 --> 28:30.203
<i>When I was eight years old,</i>

28:30.276 --> 28:34.110
<i>my Aunt Phoebe took me to see a
production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

28:34.180 --> 28:36.546
<i>My mother told her
that I was too young.</i>

28:36.616 --> 28:39.312
<i>But Phoebe said you're never
too young for Shakespeare.</i>

28:39.386 --> 28:40.478
<i>And she was right.</i>

28:40.553 --> 28:42.384
<i>I loved every minute of it.</i>

28:42.455 --> 28:46.221
<i>After that, once a year, she took
me to New York to see a new play.</i>

28:46.292 --> 28:48.556
<i>Some I liked better than others.</i>

28:48.628 --> 28:50.095
<i>And the year Uncle Sully died,</i>

28:50.163 --> 28:54.463
<i>she took me to see the opening of
her first play, Murder Comes Knocking.</i>

28:58.371 --> 28:59.702
<i>I watched the play.</i>

28:59.773 --> 29:02.799
<i>But mostly, I watched her
watching the play.</i>

29:03.209 --> 29:05.609
<i>And I saw something
I hadn't seen much of</i>

29:05.678 --> 29:09.136
<i>up to that point, an
absolute love of what she did.</i>

29:09.215 --> 29:10.944
<i>Somehow, I couldn't believe that that woman</i>

29:11.017 --> 29:13.247
<i>would let herself be stopped
by writer's block</i>

29:13.319 --> 29:16.186
<i>or stoop to some cheap
gimmick to get publicity.</i>

29:16.256 --> 29:17.553
<i>What I could believe</i>

29:17.624 --> 29:20.752
<i>was that someone who had been
jealous of her success for years</i>

29:20.827 --> 29:24.126
<i>would do almost anything to keep
her from producing another play.</i>

29:28.301 --> 29:30.292
<i>Take five, will you kids?</i>

29:41.214 --> 29:45.742
<i>Well, what are we doing,
slumming?</i>

29:46.786 --> 29:48.014
I beg your pardon?

29:48.088 --> 29:50.716
Phoebe sent you down
with some cockamamie story

29:50.790 --> 29:54.692
<i>about how she's just too
busy to get down to see me,</i>

29:54.761 --> 29:58.492
<i>but we must, dear, have
lunch one day real soon.</i>

29:58.565 --> 30:00.897
Phoebe doesn't know I'm here. Oh.

30:02.602 --> 30:05.662
She didn't come
to see you this afternoon?

30:07.540 --> 30:11.101
I suppose you were with
people who could verify that?

30:12.378 --> 30:14.243
<i>You know, Tommy,</i>

30:14.314 --> 30:17.306
I don't think I appreciate
your tone of voice.

30:17.383 --> 30:20.079
<i>Well, I don't think you're gonna
appreciate this a whole lot more.</i>

30:20.153 --> 30:23.953
<i>You had one play on Broadway,
one success and then oblivion.</i>

30:24.023 --> 30:26.753
<i>Oh, I had a cult following.</i>

30:27.560 --> 30:30.825
While you watched Phoebe
have one hit after another.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.727
Cheap commercial theatrics.

30:32.799 --> 30:34.926
<i>Well, you know what I think?</i>

30:35.168 --> 30:37.602
I think you can't stand the idea

30:37.837 --> 30:39.998
of seeing her have
one more big success.

30:40.073 --> 30:43.338
<i>That's where you're wrong, Tommy.
I don't begrudge Phoebe anything.</i>

30:43.776 --> 30:47.177
<i>Not her success,
nor her marriage. Nothing.</i>

30:47.514 --> 30:51.450
<i>Frankly, I don't think this
conversation is leading us anywhere.</i>

30:51.518 --> 30:54.510
<i>So, if you'll forgive me,
I am rather busy.</i>

30:58.074 --> 31:00.474
<i>Oh, that rental car
you're driving.</i>

31:00.543 --> 31:01.840
Is that part of your deal here?

31:01.911 --> 31:04.038
I don't have a rental car.

31:04.213 --> 31:05.976
<i>As a matter of fact,
I don't have any car.</i>

31:07.416 --> 31:10.408
<i>You know, Tommy. I just
never learned to drive.</i>

31:16.092 --> 31:18.686
All right.
Let's pick it up from the top.

31:19.328 --> 31:21.626
<i>Jenny, you be a little bit
more downstage,</i>

31:21.697 --> 31:25.189
<i>and please, now,
let's pick up the tempo.</i>

31:29.438 --> 31:31.770
<i>I know what you're thinking,
and you're right.</i>

31:31.841 --> 31:34.366
<i>Breaking into
the Ace One Car Rental Agency,</i>

31:34.443 --> 31:36.172
<i>especially with
an expired license,</i>

31:36.245 --> 31:40.545
<i>could be one of those little
mistakes that turn into big problems.</i>

31:48.257 --> 31:52.387
<i>On the other hand, at this point I
really didn't see what other choice I had.</i>

31:52.461 --> 31:55.191
<i>And sometimes you have to
risk those little mistakes</i>

31:55.264 --> 31:57.061
<i>to get the big reward.</i>

32:24.527 --> 32:27.394
<i>Now, all I had to do was
figure out what the big reward</i>

32:27.463 --> 32:29.260
<i>was doing following Phoebe,</i>

32:29.332 --> 32:32.199
<i>and if he was the one
who had stolen her play.</i>

32:32.268 --> 32:35.760
<i>There was something real familiar
about the name Theo Winters.</i>

32:35.838 --> 32:37.328
<i>I knew, I knew who he was,</i>

32:37.406 --> 32:39.601
<i>but I couldn't quite place it.</i>

32:39.976 --> 32:41.773
<i>I was pretty sure
Phoebe would know</i>

32:41.844 --> 32:43.903
<i>or at the very least, Higgins.</i>

33:06.602 --> 33:08.695
<i>Yeah.
T. C., it's me.</i>

33:08.771 --> 33:10.329
<i>Thomas?
Yes.</i>

33:10.406 --> 33:13.375
Does the name Theo Winters
mean anything to you?

33:13.442 --> 33:15.410
<i>I can't hear you.
Theo Winters.</i>

33:15.478 --> 33:18.641
Does the name Theo Winters
mean anything to you?

33:18.714 --> 33:20.375
I'll have that character reference ready

33:20.449 --> 33:21.939
if you want to come by
and pick it up.

33:22.018 --> 33:24.145
<i>T. C., I need
a little help here.</i>

33:24.286 --> 33:27.255
You sure do. That's why it
took me a while to write it.

33:27.323 --> 33:30.190
I'm talking about Theo Winters.

33:30.259 --> 33:33.285
<i>For some reason, that
name just sticks out to me.</i>

33:33.362 --> 33:35.523
Does this have anything
to do with the case

33:35.598 --> 33:39.466
you're not investigating because
your investigator's license ran out?

33:39.535 --> 33:41.628
But I can't quite place it.

33:41.771 --> 33:44.535
<i>Theo Winters.
Yeah, you know him?</i>

33:45.041 --> 33:46.633
The name does sound familiar.

33:49.912 --> 33:50.970
T. C?

33:51.047 --> 33:53.277
<i>Wait a minute, let me look.</i>

34:07.096 --> 34:10.429
<i>Sardi's. The night
Phoebe's play opened.</i>

34:10.498 --> 34:12.433
<i>Maybe it was the excitement
of the night,</i>

34:12.501 --> 34:14.833
<i>maybe Phoebe was just
a bit overly dramatic,</i>

34:14.904 --> 34:16.895
<i>but when one critic
who didn't like her play</i>

34:16.972 --> 34:18.530
<i>walked into the restaurant,</i>

34:18.607 --> 34:21.838
<i>she dumped her Hungarian goulash on his head.</i>

34:21.911 --> 34:25.312
<i>I ducked under the table as the
food fight started in earnest.</i>

34:25.380 --> 34:27.849
<i>And the critic for the
theatrical trade paper, Act One,</i>

34:27.917 --> 34:29.077
<i>just stood there,</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:31.346
<i>goulash oozing down his suit.</i>

34:31.687 --> 34:34.382
<i>His name was Theo Winters.</i>

34:34.623 --> 34:36.250
<i>I guess it was crawling
underneath the desk</i>

34:36.324 --> 34:38.418
<i>that helped me
remember that night.</i>

34:38.494 --> 34:42.897
<i>Which just goes to prove that there
really are no little mistakes in life.</i>

34:46.235 --> 34:47.565
<i>On the other hand, Theo Winters</i>

34:47.636 --> 34:49.228
<i>had made
a definite little mistake</i>

34:49.304 --> 34:52.638
<i>in using his real name and
address when renting a car.</i>

34:53.007 --> 34:55.636
<i>That's if he didn't
want to get caught.</i>

35:18.400 --> 35:20.493
<i>Hello, Denny.</i>

35:27.910 --> 35:31.903
<i>Here, take it, take it,
it's worthless.</i>

35:31.981 --> 35:35.644
I paid some idiot $50 to
steal that thing for me

35:35.718 --> 35:38.744
and it's garbage.
It's gibberish.

35:39.288 --> 35:42.689
<i>The great Phoebe Sullivan,
she's lost it.</i>

35:43.392 --> 35:44.916
And she's lost her mind.

35:58.176 --> 36:00.371
I'm afraid I made
a little mistake.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.084
I underestimated
your ability to find me.

36:03.696 --> 36:04.822
<i>Drink, Mr. Magnum?</i>

36:05.665 --> 36:07.064
No.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.363
Is our Mr. Parker all right?

36:10.436 --> 36:14.167
He's explaining a few things to a
friend of mine in the police department.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.606
And I suppose I should expect
to hear their heavy knock

36:16.676 --> 36:18.541
on my door at any moment.

36:20.179 --> 36:23.012
I assure you that I had
nothing to do with the theft.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.109
I will admit that Denny
Parker was the first person

36:26.185 --> 36:27.846
<i>I contacted on my arrival,</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:29.979
<i>and when he offered
to sell me the manuscript,</i>

36:30.056 --> 36:33.219
<i>I felt, well, it was at least
worth examining.</i>

36:33.292 --> 36:35.055
Why are you following my aunt?

36:35.127 --> 36:37.322
Phoebe Sullivan
is a public figure.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.990
One of great curiosity
to my readers.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.330
<i>When she disappeared
a few months ago,</i>

36:43.402 --> 36:46.098
everyone assumed that she had
gone in seclusion again to write.

36:46.172 --> 36:47.867
<i>However, I was in Connecticut,</i>

36:47.940 --> 36:50.875
<i>visiting a friend
at the Middlebury Clinic,</i>

36:50.943 --> 36:55.004
I bumped into Phoebe
in Dr. Gilford's office.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.809
He is one of the foremost
experts on Alzheimer's Disease

36:57.883 --> 36:58.907
and related disorders.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.249
<i>Now, it occurred to me
that if Phoebe Sullivan</i>

37:02.655 --> 37:04.885
were suffering from...
She isn't.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.390
I checked with the records
department at Middlebury.

37:08.461 --> 37:10.759
<i>Naturally, they gave me nothing.</i>

37:11.063 --> 37:12.826
And then Phoebe ran.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.195
<i>I pursued her all the way here,</i>

37:15.267 --> 37:19.135
<i>but she's very slippery.
I thought I had her yesterday,</i>

37:19.205 --> 37:21.173
but she slipped away
before I could talk to her.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.867
She won't even let me
get near her.

37:22.942 --> 37:25.467
<i>Well, there's no need.
You can go home, Mr. Winters.</i>

37:25.544 --> 37:27.171
There's no story.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.913
<i>If there is one, I'll find out.</i>

37:30.983 --> 37:33.850
And I'll write about it.
Why?

37:34.653 --> 37:38.453
Because you're a great writer
with a story that has to be told?

37:38.524 --> 37:40.219
Or because you're still nursing a wounded ego

37:40.292 --> 37:42.590
over a 30-year-old
plate of Hungarian goulash?

37:50.970 --> 37:53.803
<i>I'd learned not to count
on a lot of things in life,</i>

37:53.873 --> 37:55.738
<i>but one thing I could
always count on,</i>

37:55.808 --> 37:58.208
<i>in an odd way,
was my Aunt Phoebe.</i>

37:58.978 --> 38:01.173
<i>She was unconventional
and nobody in my family</i>

38:01.247 --> 38:05.013
<i>could quite understand why staid,
solid, Uncle Sully had married her.</i>

38:05.084 --> 38:08.850
<i>But I knew why. He married
her because she was exciting</i>

38:08.921 --> 38:11.185
<i>and unpredictable, full of life.</i>

38:11.257 --> 38:13.122
<i>And I knew she always would be.</i>

38:13.192 --> 38:14.819
<i>I still had to believe
there was nothing</i>

38:14.894 --> 38:17.089
<i>that could drag
my Aunt Phoebe down.</i>

38:17.196 --> 38:20.688
<i>Not as long as there was
something I could do about it.</i>

38:21.300 --> 38:22.392
You're home.

38:22.468 --> 38:26.666
What's all this? I'll bet you
thought I'd forgotten how to cook.

38:26.739 --> 38:31.733
<i>Well, I had a terrible time finding all
the ingredients, but it's your favorite.</i>

38:33.546 --> 38:37.710
<i>Aunt Phoebe,
I saw Dennis Parker tonight.</i>

38:37.783 --> 38:40.149
<i>Oh, Sully,
please, let's not talk shop.</i>

38:40.219 --> 38:41.550
Not tonight.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.445
Thomas.

38:45.691 --> 38:49.855
I'm afraid I cannot remember what
I did with your anniversary present.

38:50.296 --> 38:52.787
I remember buying it
and bringing it home.

38:53.299 --> 38:54.664
Aunt Phoebe.

38:54.733 --> 38:58.760
But I haven't seen hide
nor hair of it since then.

39:01.373 --> 39:04.069
Maybe Myrtle put it away
when she was cleaning up.

39:04.143 --> 39:05.542
Aunt Phoebe.

39:06.912 --> 39:08.641
I've been thinking

39:09.248 --> 39:12.115
we really ought to
fix this place up.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.711
<i>Not just redecorate, but
really shake down the rafters.</i>

39:16.222 --> 39:18.850
<i>Oh, Sully, did you really
think I'd be the kind</i>

39:18.924 --> 39:20.448
to want to put down roots?

39:20.526 --> 39:24.428
I'm not Sully. I'm Thomas.

39:42.081 --> 39:44.311
Who are you?

39:46.585 --> 39:47.916
I'm sorry.

39:53.559 --> 39:55.083
I'm sorry.

39:55.394 --> 40:00.491
I'm afraid my husband
isn't home right now.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.264
Aunt Phoebe.

40:06.572 --> 40:08.665
What happened to your play?

40:10.876 --> 40:12.366
You found it.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.238
Thomas.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.088
You found it.

40:37.836 --> 40:41.067
<i>It isn't very good, is it?</i>

41:00.793 --> 41:02.727
<i>What took me
a long time to sort out</i>

41:02.795 --> 41:04.956
<i>was why I was mad at Phoebe.</i>

41:05.030 --> 41:06.463
<i>She hadn't let me down.</i>

41:06.532 --> 41:07.931
<i>Life was letting her down.</i>

41:08.000 --> 41:09.991
<i>And try as I might,
I couldn't figure out</i>

41:10.069 --> 41:12.765
<i>what I could do
to turn that around for her.</i>

41:14.139 --> 41:18.735
Magnum. The police are here to
take a statement from Phoebe.

41:19.178 --> 41:22.807
<i>Apparently, she is gone.
So is the Audi.</i>

41:44.136 --> 41:48.766
<i>"Lovers and madmen
have such seething brains,</i>

41:49.474 --> 41:52.238
<i>"such shaping fantasies,
that apprehend</i>

41:52.311 --> 41:56.338
"more than cool reason

41:56.915 --> 41:59.782
<i>"The lunatic, the lover

41:59.851 --> 42:02.820
"are of imagination all compact.

42:02.921 --> 42:06.049
<i>"The one sees more devils

42:06.124 --> 42:07.853
<i>"that is, the madman.</i>

42:08.026 --> 42:11.325
<i>"The lover, all as frantic,

"Such tricks hath
strong imagination."

42:53.372 --> 42:55.135
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

42:57.209 --> 42:58.574
I remember.

43:07.052 --> 43:09.486
What a joy it was

43:09.821 --> 43:14.758
for me to see you seeing
things for the first time.

43:20.799 --> 43:25.327
Aunt Phoebe... I'm going
to go back to New York.

43:26.204 --> 43:28.798
I want you to stay here with me.

43:28.874 --> 43:30.569
<i>I thought that's what
I wanted, too.</i>

43:30.642 --> 43:35.238
I tricked myself into
thinking I was in danger.

43:36.281 --> 43:39.717
So you'd come riding in
on a white horse

43:40.352 --> 43:41.979
and rescue me.

43:42.054 --> 43:45.182
I want to rescue you.
I know.

43:46.692 --> 43:48.523
<i>Well, then stay here.</i>

43:49.661 --> 43:53.995
<i>Some days things are so clear,</i>

43:54.066 --> 43:58.332
I think this is all just
going to go away.

43:59.104 --> 44:04.041
But it isn't. I need to be
around a lot of people

44:04.109 --> 44:06.543
who will keep me
thinking and working.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.511
I have that in New York.

44:08.580 --> 44:13.540
<i>My theater family. And a few
regular family members, too,</i>

44:13.618 --> 44:15.643
if I can put up with them.

44:17.289 --> 44:19.883
I always did need
a lot of distraction.

44:20.125 --> 44:24.391
I'm afraid my life here
would get too sedentary.

44:26.565 --> 44:30.899
And I realize now that I
needed to see you again.

44:31.269 --> 44:33.237
One more time.

44:34.373 --> 44:37.809
And to let you know
how much I love you.

44:41.813 --> 44:43.713
Aunt Phoebe.

44:43.782 --> 44:46.808
And to let you know I'm
going to be okay with this.

44:46.885 --> 44:49.979
<i>Really, I am.</i>

44:56.895 --> 45:00.331
And don't judge
Dennis too harshly.

45:02.401 --> 45:04.801
Life didn't work out for him

45:04.903 --> 45:07.804
as well as it did for us.

45:19.184 --> 45:21.084
<i>"A revival of

refurbished David Garrick Theater.

45:24.689 --> 45:27.590
"All of New York society is
waiting in keen anticipation

45:27.659 --> 45:29.456
"to see if author

45:29.961 --> 45:31.861

45:32.230 --> 45:35.722

45:35.801 --> 45:37.063
"and carry her name."

45:37.436 --> 45:41.031
<i>Jonathan, isn't that wonderful?</i>

45:41.373 --> 45:44.001
<i>Apparently, it was
Theo Winters' idea.</i>

45:45.644 --> 45:47.942
<i>"Miss Sullivan,
who has gone into seclusion"</i>

45:48.013 --> 45:51.847
<i>"to write and reflect, could

45:56.054 --> 46:00.753
<i>Oh, incidentally, your renewed
investigator's license arrived in the mail.</i>

46:08.033 --> 46:11.093
<i>More tea?
No, thanks, Lani.</i>

46:21.980 --> 46:24.380
Keo will be back
tomorrow morning.

46:26.585 --> 46:29.486
I think I'll take a walk.

46:42.267 --> 46:45.202
<i>"And as imagination bodies forth"</i>
