[theme music playing]

01:45.188 --> 01:47.024
[loud music playing]

01:56.241 --> 01:59.452
[Conway] <i>Otherwise, it was just socialism,</i>
<i>which is built to fail.</i>

01:59.536 --> 02:02.748
<i>And you don't get points
for failure, Mr. President.</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:06.168
<i>People don't want failure.
They want success.</i>

02:06.251 --> 02:08.753
[Gwen] <i>Let's discuss</i>
<i>our recent success then.</i>

02:08.836 --> 02:10.839
You have been very critical
of the president

02:10.923 --> 02:12.966
for not being strong on terror.

02:13.050 --> 02:17.721
Just last week, U.S. special forces
captured Yusuf Al Ahmadi,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.222
and they have him in custody.

02:19.306 --> 02:23.226
So would you now say that your criticism
of the president was unfounded?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.063
[Conway] The capture of Ahmadi
is a step forward,

02:26.146 --> 02:29.650
but the real issue here
is sustained security.

02:29.733 --> 02:33.445
The president sent in American troops
without consulting the Syrians.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.781
Now, that's gonna do real damage

02:35.864 --> 02:37.704
to our ability to work with them
in the future.

02:37.783 --> 02:40.869
<i>See, this isn't about notches in a belt.</i>

02:40.953 --> 02:44.206
<i>It's about a safer world for our nation.</i>

02:44.289 --> 02:46.792
<i>A better future for our children.</i>

02:46.875 --> 02:51.714
<i>Governor, I understand that words
like "safer" and "children" play well.</i>

02:51.797 --> 02:55.050
<i>But national security is a complex
and ever-changing landscape</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:59.387
that sometimes requires restraint,
sometimes decisive action.

02:59.471 --> 03:03.809
So I think maybe we want to put aside
what sounds good in the moment

03:03.892 --> 03:06.561
and be adaptable with our policy
in terms of reality.

03:06.644 --> 03:10.357
Oh, I don't need a lecture on reality
like I'm a schoolboy, Mrs. Underwood.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.693
I've actually fought in the Middle East.
So has the general.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.280
Our views on international diplomacy
aren't just pretty words.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.117
[Frank] We can debate policy
all you'd like, Governor,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.369
but there is one thing
that is undebatable.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.413
<i>And that is ICO is no longer
the threat it once was</i>

03:25.497 --> 03:26.874
<i>without their leadership.</i>

03:29.960 --> 03:33.296
- You're not watching the debate?
- I know what they're going to say.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.965
How can I help you, Doug?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.760
I told you there'd be a day.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.809
There's no reason you shouldn't keep this
and retire with honor.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.562
How are we looking?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.982
[Aidan] <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>high impact on "ever-changing."</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:53.275
<i>And Conway took the bait</i>

03:53.358 --> 03:57.112
and played right into
"schoolboy" and "pretty,"

03:57.195 --> 04:00.240
which gives you "pretty boy."
It was beautiful.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.410
<i>- What about the marriage stuff?</i>
- Well, the more they can keep saying

04:03.493 --> 04:08.206
"together" and "beyond" and "become"
in any context, we score on those.

04:08.290 --> 04:12.002
I don't discuss the private conversations
we have on the Intelligence Committee.

04:12.085 --> 04:16.339
- Whistle-blowing insulates you.
- And kneecap my party's nominee?

04:16.423 --> 04:17.673
I don't think so.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.969
He's going to lie about it at this debate.
They both are.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.305
You're going to tell the truth.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.850
You can't have it both ways, Governor.
We got him, period.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.269
Unilateral, short-sighted action.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.438
Unilateral because you and the general

04:31.521 --> 04:34.066
pitted the Republicans
against my involving the Russians.

04:34.149 --> 04:35.275
That's just not true.

04:35.358 --> 04:38.153
Are you saying
that you did not have the general

04:38.236 --> 04:41.239
contact members
of the House Intelligence Committee?

04:41.323 --> 04:42.324
[chuckles]

04:42.407 --> 04:43.575
[Gwen] General,
would you care to comment?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.243
[Brockhart] When I resigned my commission,

04:45.327 --> 04:48.621
I stopped talking to members of Congress
about matters of national security.

04:48.705 --> 04:52.209
- So you are saying that you did not?
- No, ma'am. I did not.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.462
[Frank] You and I both know
that you interfered, Governor.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.965
You admitted so much to me
when I asked you personally.

04:58.048 --> 05:01.718
You told me that the general had spoken
to members of that committee.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.889
I told you that I have friends
on the committee, which is true.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.016
Not that I interfere with committee work.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.520
You lined up every Republican to be
opposed to the Russians being involved.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.397
It was unanimous opposition.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.649
Well, if your plan was
to get Russian support

05:16.733 --> 05:19.694
by giving away drill sites,
I don't blame them.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.780
<i>So just to be absolutely clear,
for the record,</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:26.952
<i>you are saying, Governor, that neither you
nor the general made any contact</i>

05:27.035 --> 05:28.954
<i>with any member of
the House Intelligence Committee?</i>

05:29.037 --> 05:31.289
<i>I absolutely did not.</i>

05:31.373 --> 05:33.666
You're putting me
in an impossible place here.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.295
You put yourself there
when you lied about your service record.

05:37.379 --> 05:41.091
Whose lie do you want exposed?
Conway's or yours?

05:42.550 --> 05:43.718
Go home and think about it.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.766
Doesn't need to happen tomorrow.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.144
It just needs to happen
before Election Day.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.653
I'm not trying
to diminish your contribution

06:01.736 --> 06:04.031
to your husband's presidency,
Mrs. Underwood,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.158
but I do question your experience.

06:06.241 --> 06:10.412
No one's fully prepared to be president
when he or she becomes one.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.455
Not even you.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.581
And look at the polls.

06:13.665 --> 06:17.127
Over half the country
is open to a First Lady as VP.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.587
And more than half of the country
wants a new president.

06:19.671 --> 06:22.882
It's true that you are leading
in the polls for now, Governor,

06:22.966 --> 06:25.427
but the gap has been closing
in recent weeks.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.970
Well, when people show up to vote

06:27.054 --> 06:30.933
and have to confront the possibility
of Claire Underwood as president,

06:31.016 --> 06:33.435
they're gonna have a gut check
and make the right choice.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.063
You're absolutely right.
That means they'll vote for us.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.982
Because they'll look around and realize
that if anything happens to me,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.984
they'll be in very good hands with Claire.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.569
And, you know, she's right.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.780
No one can prepare
to become the president.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.784
But I have been the president,
and now I know what it takes.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.870
It requires confidence, openness,
effectiveness,

06:52.955 --> 06:54.957
and Claire has all of those qualities.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.917
I'm sorry, Mr. President. It...
It looks like we have to take a break.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.879
We'll return shortly
to the first-ever simultaneous debate

07:01.964 --> 07:04.591
between presidential candidates
and their running mates.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.218
[man] And we're clear.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.347
Mr. President, Mrs. Underwood,
would you please come with me?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.277
[man] <i>Read it.</i>

07:24.361 --> 07:25.653
<i>What?</i>

07:25.737 --> 07:28.490
<i>"We are citizens of the United States.</i>

07:28.573 --> 07:31.994
<i>We have been taken hostage
in the name of God</i>

07:32.077 --> 07:35.038
<i>by the Islamic Caliphate Organization."</i>

07:36.999 --> 07:39.167
- [gasps]
<i>- Read it.</i>

07:39.251 --> 07:42.379
<i>"Our country is guilty
of illegal aggression</i>

07:42.462 --> 07:44.672
<i>and mass murder against Muslims.</i>

07:44.756 --> 07:46.508
<i>We beg for mercy."</i>

07:47.675 --> 07:50.720
[man] <i>ICO will grant mercy</i>
<i>only if these demands are met.</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:54.682
<i>One, cessation
of all U.S. military activity in Syria.</i>

07:54.766 --> 07:58.645
<i>Two, ten billion dollars in reparations
paid to the caliphate.</i>

07:58.728 --> 08:01.648
<i>Three, the safe return of our leader,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi,</i>

08:01.731 --> 08:03.650
<i>from his unjust imprisonment.</i>

08:03.733 --> 08:06.069
<i>We will not communicate
with the criminal Frank Underwood.</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:09.322
<i>We will only communicate
with his successor, William Conway.</i>

08:11.741 --> 08:14.202
<i>If these demands aren't met in 24 hours...</i>

08:15.245 --> 08:17.372
<i>mercy will not be granted.</i>

08:17.455 --> 08:20.500
Released to seven outlets.
Encrypted email, deep web.

08:20.583 --> 08:25.547
The hostages are Jim and Caroline Miller,
their daughter Melissa, from Knoxville.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.675
Mr. President, whatever you need,
I'm here to offer assistance.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.677
I'll let you know.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.763
[cell phone chimes]

08:38.226 --> 08:40.352
So far, we've identified
the drywall and lighting.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.813
All U.S. manufactured.

08:41.895 --> 08:45.317
The video was shot
on a Panasonic HD camcorder,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.069
most widely sold in the States.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.196
So we know they're in the country.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.948
Well, commercial flight is out.
Private plane is unlikely.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.700
We're confident
that they traveled by ground,

08:53.783 --> 08:55.827
probably the Millers' hijacked car.

08:55.910 --> 08:59.497
[Green] Last known location is a Denny's
just outside of Knoxville.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.582
A debit card transaction.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.085
This is footage of them
leaving the restaurant.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.801
Our hearts go out
to the Millers' family and loved ones.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.054
But we're confident
that the president is doing

09:14.137 --> 09:16.139
everything possible
to achieve their release.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.015
I told the president that we'd be willing

09:18.100 --> 09:21.144
to assist in any way
if it would be helpful.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.397
This is a time when America
needs to pull together and...

09:25.315 --> 09:26.816
- [sighs]
- Stop.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.112
It's "pull together
and pray for the Millers."

09:30.195 --> 09:32.280
- And then I come in, and...
- I didn't forget.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.991
I just feel this is wrong.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.536
It implies we're willing
to negotiate with terrorists.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.914
We should keep our mouths shut.
Let the authorities do their job.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.085
We don't get press
by keeping our mouths shut.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.920
You had me lie on national television.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.216
And now you want us to send out some video
that only encourages these people?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.426
And you wanna do that
to score some press coverage?

09:54.344 --> 09:57.847
If it doesn't make you feel comfortable,
I can do it on my own.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.643
I'll be outside.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.108
- [door closes]
- I've had enough of him.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.401
He does have a point.

10:09.484 --> 10:13.363
Look, they're gonna kill that family
whether we send this out or not.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.073
We might as well say
I was willing to show up for duty.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.825
Well, I have to say,
I agree with the general.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.452
- Press record.
- [sighs]

10:19.536 --> 10:21.037
Press record!

10:23.915 --> 10:27.210
Our hearts go out
to the Millers' family and loved ones...

10:27.294 --> 10:28.920
What do we know about the captor?

10:29.003 --> 10:31.423
Our Syrian assets say this is a lone wolf.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.882
[Green] Two wolves, actually.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.302
When we pumped up
the contrast in the video,

10:35.385 --> 10:38.680
we saw a shadow on the wall
from someone behind the camera.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.600
Voice analysis points
to western Tennessee, Memphis area.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.811
Uh, Mr. President, if I may?

10:44.894 --> 10:47.063
Agent Holbrooke,
our top negotiating expert.

10:47.147 --> 10:51.234
Uh, we've run 16 possible models
in preparation for an incident like this.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.654
Now, what we have here
are key elements from three of them.

10:54.737 --> 10:58.575
American kidnappers, the abduction
of a child and proxy communication...

10:58.658 --> 11:00.327
Why did they want Conway?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
That's the real question.
I'll tell you why.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.458
Because I would've done
exactly the same thing if it had been me.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.210
It undermines my authority.

11:09.126 --> 11:12.630
Throws me off balance.
Pits me against my rival.

11:12.714 --> 11:15.800
And because I don't have children,
and he does.

11:15.883 --> 11:19.387
They know I won't compromise.
No president would.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.933
But a would-be president like Conway,
well, he might.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.353
Tactically, we need more time.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.116
I can't guarantee that we can
track them down in less than 24 hours.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.525
Enough.
Here's what I wanna do.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.110
[Seth] The president
is working with the FBI

11:34.193 --> 11:36.529
and other law enforcement
and intelligence agencies

11:36.613 --> 11:38.323
to locate the Millers.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.533
Now, in order to protect
the integrity of those efforts,

11:40.617 --> 11:43.703
I won't be sharing any details
on their progress at the moment.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.332
In the meantime, the president
is reaching out to Governor Conway

11:47.415 --> 11:50.585
should contact with the captors
be established.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.211
Now, let me be clear.

11:53.129 --> 11:57.800
We're not talking about negotiation,
just communication.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.303
[Conway] You could've asked me
privately first.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.596
[Frank] <i>It was tactical,</i>

12:01.679 --> 12:04.266
<i>to show the kidnappers
that we respect their wishes.</i>

12:05.224 --> 12:06.976
This doesn't leave me a choice.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.853
Well, you can always say no, Governor.

12:08.936 --> 12:12.274
We have a plan for how we can
handle this without your participation.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.816
<i>How would that work?</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:17.111
Well, I say publicly that I'm willing
to speak to the captors myself.

12:17.194 --> 12:21.240
Now, if they refuse,
we'd have to be prepared for the worst.

12:21.324 --> 12:26.538
<i>But our team believes that you give us
a better shot at opening a dialogue.</i>

12:26.621 --> 12:29.582
- To negotiate.
<i>- To buy us time.</i>

12:29.666 --> 12:31.208
And if you do say yes,

12:31.293 --> 12:33.378
we'd want you at the White House
as soon as possible.

12:33.461 --> 12:36.130
[sighs] I need to discuss with my people.

12:36.213 --> 12:40.343
<i>I'm hoping that you'll agree to help us.
Either way, I'll need an answer soon.</i>

12:41.135 --> 12:43.430
I understand.
I'll let you know within the hour.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.264
Thank you, Governor.

12:47.266 --> 12:51.062
Everyone has a flaw, and this is Conway's.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.315
<i>I spoke with the president,
and I said that I'm willing</i>

12:53.398 --> 12:55.692
<i>to assist in any way
if it would be helpful.</i>

12:56.609 --> 13:01.906
He aches for the spotlight.
He feels almost invisible without it.

13:01.989 --> 13:06.661
Now, if he's center stage on this,
he can't fault my performance,

13:06.744 --> 13:09.539
because we're sharing the stage together.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.958
If I get booed, he gets booed.

13:13.418 --> 13:17.213
But it's really the applause
that Conway's hungry for.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.466
Trust me, he'll say yes.

13:19.549 --> 13:24.346
The stage is too big and the spotlight
too tempting for him to be...

13:25.513 --> 13:27.349
a mere spectator.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.726
But I've already said publicly
I'd assist if he asked.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.812
That was a mistake,
and I should've pushed back on it more.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.397
But you can't let him
take advantage of it.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.774
Well, I've said it. It's done.
And now we have to move forward.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.693
- This is fucking disgusting.
- [groans]

13:38.776 --> 13:40.695
You say, "After much consideration,

13:40.778 --> 13:42.898
I don't feel comfortable
negotiating with terrorists."

13:42.947 --> 13:46.200
And then I come off not only as a liar,
but as a coward.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.744
Why do this when we're ahead?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.287
By what? Five points?
That's not a lead. That's a coin toss.

13:50.372 --> 13:54.041
My message this entire campaign
has been about serving the country,

13:54.125 --> 13:56.586
showing up for duty,
and now I'm gonna not show up

13:56.669 --> 13:59.464
when the commander in chief
has asked for my help?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.597
[reporter on TV]
<i>...and the speech patterns.</i>

14:07.680 --> 14:10.808
<i>The captor is
the one who you heard on the camera.</i>

14:10.892 --> 14:12.477
<i>Seems to be American.</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:16.313
<i>And the way he's released the video
shows he's computer savvy.</i>

14:16.398 --> 14:20.317
<i>Now, ICO recruiters have been
turning to social media networks</i>

14:20.402 --> 14:23.530
<i>like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,</i>

14:23.613 --> 14:26.866
<i>to initiate contact with users
sympathetic to their cause.</i>

14:26.949 --> 14:29.452
- [Walker] Oh, Tom.
<i>- Earlier groups, like al-Qaeda,</i>

14:29.536 --> 14:33.205
<i>didn't use social networking
anywhere near the degree that ICO has.</i>

14:33.289 --> 14:35.750
- [Tom sighs]
<i>- It is possible that this captor...</i>

14:35.833 --> 14:38.420
- Mr. President.
- Good flight?

14:38.503 --> 14:40.797
- A little bumpy, but fine.
- Come on in.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.758
[reporter continues indistinctly]

14:43.841 --> 14:45.217
[Tom] You play?

14:46.636 --> 14:51.015
Well, that's debatable. [chuckles]
But I definitely collect.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.519
Uh, this is something.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.981
- Yeah, it's terrible.
- [TV turns off]

14:59.065 --> 15:01.901
I don't envy Frank right now.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.486
Have a seat.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.572
- Coffee? Tea?
- No, thanks.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.034
[Walker sighs]

15:11.703 --> 15:14.956
I appreciate you taking the time,
given everything that's going on.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.667
It's not as though
anyone's calling for my advice.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.421
Although I'm not sure
this article is pertinent at the moment.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.549
I'm not here about your scholarship fund.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.427
I don't understand.
My assistant said you wanted to write...

15:27.510 --> 15:31.180
I lied...
so you'd meet with me.

15:31.263 --> 15:34.308
We have a domestic surveillance program,
beta phase,

15:34.391 --> 15:36.227
aimed at finding ICO recruits.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.190
I was briefed
when we got the FISA court ruling.

15:38.229 --> 15:41.691
Well, this is a domestic investigation.
We have to work through the FBI.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.900
Now, they're sending over a team,

15:42.984 --> 15:45.612
and I'd like for Homeland and the CIA
to join them.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.991
This is a sensitive program.
Shouldn't you keep it in-house?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.202
We've been criticized for not involving
other agencies in the past.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.371
I'd like to avoid that.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.332
- You want clearances?
- As soon as possible.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.585
It's all hands on deck, Doug.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.088
- [Frank] Governor.
- Mr. President.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.757
[Frank chuckles]

16:07.759 --> 16:11.053
Well, and this must be Charlie.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.764
- [Frank laughs]
- [Hannah chuckles] Charlie...

16:12.847 --> 16:14.474
[Conway] Shake
the president's hand, Charlie.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.726
- [Hannah] Come on, Charlie.
- You said he was a vampire.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.480
- [Frank and Conway laugh]
- Well, don't worry. You're safe here.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.148
No monsters in the White House.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.901
[Claire chuckles]
I'll show you where you're staying.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.611
[Hannah] Okay.
Come on, Charlie.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.533
- Have you ever been in the Oval?
- Once, when I was a kid.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.201
My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.245
Of course they did.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.419
I thought you'd all like to be together,
so I've put you in here,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.756
but, if not, we can put the kids
in the Lincoln Bedroom.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.383
No, this is wonderful.
Thank you.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.222
[Charlie] Is this
where we're gonna live, Mommy?

16:55.306 --> 16:59.226
[Hannah chuckles] We'll have to see
how the election goes first.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.478
[Charlie] Something smells.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.690
[Hannah] Oh, gosh.
Lily needs a change.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.942
Um, where...

17:06.025 --> 17:09.987
- The restroom is here, to the right.
- Great, thank you.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.228
[Walker] <i>You want me to put</i>
<i>a Republican in the White House.</i>

17:18.621 --> 17:21.207
[Tom] You want a Republican or a criminal?

17:21.290 --> 17:25.461
- I still have loyalty to my party, Tom.
- And where's their loyalty?

17:26.628 --> 17:29.799
They were going to impeach you.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.927
Jackie Sharp whipped Democrats.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.972
Your own Secretary of State
turned her back.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.808
Your party?
It's rotten to the core.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.603
And the core is Underwood.

17:44.689 --> 17:48.860
Aren't you angry
that he stole your presidency?

17:49.944 --> 17:51.070
I'm angry.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.865
I'm angry at myself...

17:55.241 --> 17:57.159
for not seeing it.

17:58.535 --> 18:02.582
- And for not fighting it.
- So do something now.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.087
I wanted to say Tusk lied.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.593
But once I got the pardon,
I knew nobody would believe me.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.013
I thought...

18:18.973 --> 18:20.557
"Just disappear.

18:21.517 --> 18:22.769
Go away."

18:24.395 --> 18:26.147
And that anger...

18:30.276 --> 18:32.069
If I went away...

18:33.320 --> 18:37.909
[breathes deeply]
that anger would go away.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.577
The truth is coming out.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.666
Be part of the truth.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.252
People will believe you.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.507
Once we finish with the press conference,
you'll be done.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.677
We'll take it from there.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.804
You don't want me on the call
if they contact us?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.138
Oh, you're only there for bait, Governor.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.390
I can't have you speaking
on behalf of the White House.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.061
- They said they wanted me.
- Yes, we have a roadmap in place.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.813
Then you'll have to adjust it.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.820
What right do you have to walk in here
and dictate how we're gonna handle this?

19:13.903 --> 19:17.031
I put myself on the line coming here,
and you know it.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.534
I could've backed off
and left this pile of shit in your lap.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.161
Now, if I'm gonna be exposed with you,

19:22.244 --> 19:25.247
then I'm gonna have some say
in how that happens.

19:25.331 --> 19:29.501
Or I head back to New York
and watch you squirm.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.842
Just as I'd hoped.
The more involved, the better.

19:35.925 --> 19:39.261
- [telephone beeps]
- Director Green, please.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.809
[Aidan] They here? All right.
[man] They're here.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.603
[Aidan clears throat] Thanks.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.240
This is our director.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.533
- Hello.
- President's Chief of Staff.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.619
We need every white male under 40

20:03.703 --> 20:06.330
with geo-local anomalies
in the past 72 hours.

20:06.413 --> 20:08.415
Already done that,
cross-referenced with your watchlists.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.179
We're voice matching with phone calls now.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.711
Well, we're bringing a team in here.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.546
FBI, CIA, Homeland,
along with our own people.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.507
Uh, yeah,
more cooks in the kitchen won't...

20:16.590 --> 20:19.927
I've cleared them.
We can't waste time grapevining this.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.764
Let's get everyone working
from the same place.

20:22.847 --> 20:25.307
[NSA Director]
We need to organize workflow.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.895
Right. Uh, let's talk in my office.
It's the second door on the right.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.607
Is this going to be a problem?

20:33.690 --> 20:35.234
I'd prefer them
not breathing down my neck.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.570
- [Doug] That wasn't my question.
- I told you, we're masked.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.197
[shutters clicking]

20:41.323 --> 20:43.409
[Frank] Thank you.
Please be seated.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.956
I'd like to thank Governor Conway
for agreeing to assist us.

20:49.040 --> 20:53.961
He and I share the same goal,
which is the safe return of the Millers.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.129
In order to achieve that,

20:55.212 --> 20:58.257
we're willing to open up
lines of communication with their captors.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.425
Governor.

21:02.678 --> 21:06.348
I will act as intermediary
between you and the president.

21:06.432 --> 21:10.477
To communicate with us,
dial Jim Miller's social security number

21:10.561 --> 21:14.857
followed by Caroline's into any phone
or Internet conferencing service.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.026
There will be a voice recognition prompt.

21:17.109 --> 21:21.197
Have all three Millers say
their names and state the time

21:21.280 --> 21:23.324
and that will connect you.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.663
Our hearts are with the Millers
and their families.

21:29.746 --> 21:34.085
I spoke to their siblings
and their parents last night,

21:34.168 --> 21:36.087
and they remain strong.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.966
And I would ask all Americans
to remain strong on their behalf.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.092
Thank you very much.

21:41.175 --> 21:46.347
<i>Deplorable as this situation is,
we cannot blame Islam as a whole</i>

21:46.430 --> 21:50.476
<i>or the millions of Muslims
in our nation who yearn for peace,</i>

21:50.559 --> 21:53.062
<i>who contribute to our society,</i>

21:53.145 --> 21:56.565
who have the same dreams
as all Americans do.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.568
ICO does not represent Islam.

21:59.651 --> 22:03.614
<i>But there are those
who would use this incident</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:06.033
<i>to justify draconian measures,</i>

22:06.117 --> 22:09.745
<i>like travel restrictions
or forced registration,</i>

22:09.829 --> 22:13.332
<i>who would espouse hatred
or even violence.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:17.461
The moment bigotry
becomes a form of patriotism,

22:17.544 --> 22:21.090
America is no longer America.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.550
That is why I'm here today,
in the Capitol,

22:23.634 --> 22:26.012
to urge our congressmen and women...

22:41.318 --> 22:44.446
Hear there's a push
to get the ten billion.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.616
Big debate in Ways and Means,
but it'll never make it to the floor.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.161
It's just for show.
[breathes deeply]

22:50.244 --> 22:52.579
I've been with Appropriations.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.957
- Bypass Ways and Means?
- [sighs] No.

22:55.041 --> 22:58.419
To pay for more ground troops in Syria
if we need them.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.257
So why are you meeting me
instead of at the Capitol?

23:05.301 --> 23:07.094
Tom Hammerschmidt.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.847
Has he called you, too?

23:12.849 --> 23:15.894
He reached out,
but I haven't said a word.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.149
Walker went on record.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.776
Told him I was the one
who whipped the votes for impeachment.

23:22.859 --> 23:26.155
Your story is you thought he was guilty.
There's nothing wrong with that.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.490
So you have talked to him?

23:28.574 --> 23:30.326
He has some theories.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.870
All I did was shake my head
at the parts that weren't right.

23:33.955 --> 23:35.957
You're clean if you don't talk.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.877
I want to.
On the record.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.842
I think you should, too.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.387
We can't.

23:50.471 --> 23:53.807
You will lose your seat
as soon as those photos are leaked.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.726
I may lose my seat anyway.

23:56.727 --> 24:00.897
Conway's super PAC is targeting
every California Democrat in a tight race.

24:00.982 --> 24:05.236
Even if I win,
I'm in a Republican-controlled Congress

24:05.319 --> 24:07.154
with a Republican president...

24:07.238 --> 24:10.532
or I have to do Underwood's bidding
for the next four years.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.701
What about Alan?

24:12.784 --> 24:14.745
I told him about us.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.832
He was kind about it. [chuckles]

24:20.042 --> 24:23.545
We'll divorce once everything quiets down.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.807
If you don't want the photos out there,
I won't say anything.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.479
I don't care about
what the rest of the world thinks of me.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.982
All I cared about was protecting you.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.818
Then let's do this, Remy.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.655
You and I go on the record, he's done.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.786
[CIA Director] Joshua Masterson.
Computer science major at Tennessee Tech.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.955
Taken a keen interest in Islamic studies
during the past two years.

24:59.040 --> 25:00.624
Hasn't been to class in three days.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.709
None of his friends or family
have heard from him.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.461
Voice matches the one in the video.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.880
[CIA Director] We believe his associate
is Zachary Hawthorne,

25:06.963 --> 25:09.883
high school dropout
who's remained close with Masterson.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.261
Stopped showing up for work last Tuesday.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.431
So if they call, should I...

25:15.514 --> 25:17.274
should I tell them
that we know who they are?

25:17.308 --> 25:20.018
No, you'll introduce yourself, Governor,
then you introduce me.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.980
No, the governor will do the talking,
so should he use their names or not?

25:24.065 --> 25:26.317
It could cause them to do something rash.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.154
- Agent March, our head psychologist.
- So I shouldn't.

25:30.237 --> 25:34.075
Conversely, it could humanize them.
Removes the confidence of anonymity.

25:34.158 --> 25:36.577
But if they run,
it compromises everything.

25:36.660 --> 25:38.495
[Green] Not just that.
We're confident on the IDs,

25:38.579 --> 25:40.581
but if there's
the slightest chance we're wrong,

25:40.664 --> 25:41.957
it weakens our position.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.917
Then don't use their names in the call.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.130
Uh, sir, our script is written with
the understanding that I'd be speaking.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.881
We'd have to rework it for the governor.

25:49.965 --> 25:53.135
Well, then let's rework it now.
We don't know when they'll be calling.

25:53.969 --> 25:58.765
You know, the circumstances are awful,
but I have to admit...

25:58.849 --> 26:01.102
it's been nice
to take a break from the road.

26:01.185 --> 26:04.271
I don't know how you do it,
running mate and First Lady.

26:04.355 --> 26:07.483
[chuckles] I'm still trying
to figure that out myself, actually.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.985
I think it's admirable.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.822
If we win, I'd love to do something more
than update my Instagram.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.449
[both chuckle]

26:15.532 --> 26:17.659
When I criticized that,
it was just because...

26:17.743 --> 26:21.663
No, not at all. I didn't take offense.
It's politics.

26:23.207 --> 26:26.252
I'd love to do something
like your gun bill.

26:26.335 --> 26:30.339
- It's a shame it didn't pass the Senate.
- You support that legislation?

26:30.422 --> 26:34.510
Mmm, I'm from England.
We think your gun obsession is madness.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.596
Will does, too, but he can't admit it.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.390
Mustn't upset the base.

26:39.473 --> 26:43.185
Ah, yes, the base. [chuckles]
Mustn't upset the base.

26:44.978 --> 26:47.022
[breathes deeply]

26:47.105 --> 26:49.483
You know, you're actually
a role model of mine.

26:49.566 --> 26:55.239
I mean, your work on the environment,
sexual assault, being ambassador...

26:55.322 --> 26:59.160
I mean, obviously,
I'd prefer if we win. [chuckles]

26:59.243 --> 27:04.165
But if we didn't, I think you'd make
a wonderful vice president.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.124
Mommy, what are you drinking?

27:06.208 --> 27:08.419
It's coffee, sweetheart.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.046
- I want some! I want some!
- Shh!

27:11.129 --> 27:14.090
- Not so loud. You'll wake your sister.
- [softly] Can I have some?

27:14.175 --> 27:16.009
You're not old enough.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.512
But do you want some water
or some juice?

27:18.595 --> 27:21.014
I think we've got some juice
in the fridge.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.808
I'll get it.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.017
[chuckles]

27:25.352 --> 27:28.063
[sighs] He's very cute.

27:28.146 --> 27:30.649
Do you regret it, not having children?

27:31.942 --> 27:34.611
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's too personal.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.906
Do you ever regret having them?

27:42.035 --> 27:45.080
[Green] We've got voice verification.
They're on the line, sir.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.624
Do I need to keep them engaged
so you can trace the call?

27:47.708 --> 27:48.959
[Lasker] No, Internet call.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.628
Rerouted every three milliseconds.
Untraceable.

27:51.712 --> 27:55.173
We have two main objectives.
More information, extending the deadline.

27:55.257 --> 27:58.385
But our top priority
is a first concession. Proof of life.

27:58.469 --> 28:01.513
- So you'll promise nothing.
- Okay.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.099
Keep in mind
that they may be recording this call.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.184
It's publicity they want.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.062
[sighs] Okay, I'm ready.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.068
[phone beeps]

28:15.151 --> 28:17.238
This is Governor Conway.

28:17.321 --> 28:20.657
I'd like to speak
with Jim, Caroline and Melissa.

28:20.741 --> 28:21.950
[Joshua] <i>You speak to me.</i>

28:22.033 --> 28:24.536
I need some proof
that they're still alive.

28:30.501 --> 28:34.129
Please tell Melissa
that her grandparents miss her very much

28:34.212 --> 28:37.007
and, uh, they are praying for her.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.635
<i>You're not gonna make us
feel sorry for 'em.</i>

28:39.718 --> 28:40.886
<i>How sorry did you feel</i>

28:40.969 --> 28:43.389
<i>when you dropped bombs
on innocent Muslims, Governor?</i>

28:45.641 --> 28:47.559
<i>The president's a coward.
He sends others to do his killing.</i>

28:47.643 --> 28:49.478
<i>But you're worse.</i>

28:49.561 --> 28:53.524
<i>You make speeches about how proud you are
that you fought in an unjust war.</i>

28:54.775 --> 28:57.569
<i>How would you feel if a bomb
was dropped on your daughter?</i>

28:59.655 --> 29:02.324
<i>If she was blown up
and had to be buried in pieces?</i>

29:03.325 --> 29:05.952
[Conway] You're American, right?

29:06.036 --> 29:10.081
<i>Our allegiance is to Yusuf Al Ahmadi
and the Islamic Caliphate.</i>

29:10.165 --> 29:12.668
<i>America is our enemy
and must meet our demands.</i>

29:14.878 --> 29:17.798
Uh, you understand that I can't speak
on behalf of the government.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.884
I can only communicate
what you say to the president.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.928
I'll need some time.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.973
<i>You think we're stupid?
He's listening right now.</i>

29:27.766 --> 29:30.686
This is the president speaking.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.688
<i>We talk to Conway only.</i>

29:33.605 --> 29:37.651
But if you want anything to happen,
I'm the one that can make it so.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.778
<i>Then why have you done nothing?</i>

29:39.861 --> 29:41.363
I'm talking to Congress about the money.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.366
I'm consulting with my military advisers
about a pullout,

29:44.450 --> 29:46.618
but nothing can happen in a few hours.

29:47.661 --> 29:50.289
<i>You just want more time
so you can find us.</i>

29:50.372 --> 29:52.499
Are we looking for you?
Yes.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.377
But that's only so you'll turn over
the Millers without incident.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.920
<i>But there is no handing over.</i>

29:57.003 --> 29:59.798
<i>Either you give us what we want
or we kill them.</i>

30:02.926 --> 30:05.887
Nothing will happen
until we have proof of life.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.434
<i>All right, here's your proof of life.
Cut out the girl's tongue.</i>

30:10.517 --> 30:13.562
- [Melissa screaming] <i>No!</i>
- This is Conway.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.272
<i>- No!</i>
- Please, before you do anything...

30:16.357 --> 30:18.984
- [muffled screaming] <i>Mommy!</i>
- Josh. Zach.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.861
[Melissa panting]

30:20.944 --> 30:22.488
[Joshua] <i>Do you think we care</i>
<i>you know who we are?</i>

30:22.571 --> 30:24.365
[Melissa] <i>No, stop!</i>

30:24.448 --> 30:27.368
[Conway] I'd like to speak with you,
just for a moment.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.912
I... I have something to say,
but I need Melissa to stop screaming

30:30.996 --> 30:32.414
- so I can hear you.
- [Melissa] <i>No!</i>

30:32.498 --> 30:36.627
- [Melissa screaming]
- Can I hear her voice?

30:38.128 --> 30:39.796
We need her voice.

30:39.880 --> 30:42.007
[Melissa sobbing]

30:42.090 --> 30:45.552
<i>I'm here.
I'm Melissa.</i>

30:45.636 --> 30:47.846
Hi, Melissa.
My name is Will...

30:47.929 --> 30:49.681
[Joshua] <i>You heard her voice.</i>
<i>Now talk.</i>

30:49.765 --> 30:50.766
[Melissa] <i>Oh, no.</i>

30:52.684 --> 30:55.854
Yes, I...
I've killed a lot of people.

30:57.398 --> 30:59.274
Some of them innocent people.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.987
And every single night...

31:04.070 --> 31:05.656
I haven't even told my wife this...

31:05.739 --> 31:09.075
but every single night,
I have nightmares.

31:11.327 --> 31:16.792
I picture my own daughter, Lily,
and my wife...

31:16.875 --> 31:21.046
and my son,
just like you described...

31:21.129 --> 31:22.506
blown away.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.008
Gone.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.470
Now, you could say that I...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.434
I have these demons
because what I did was wrong

31:30.472 --> 31:31.792
and that your cause is righteous.

31:31.848 --> 31:34.350
But I believed
that my cause was righteous, too.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.437
And if I could take it all back...

31:37.771 --> 31:39.189
I wouldn't do it again.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.194
The truth is... [sighs]

31:45.195 --> 31:47.448
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.461
Now, the president is right.

32:05.006 --> 32:08.218
We need more time to work on your demands,
but more importantly,

32:08.301 --> 32:11.137
I'm guessing you've never
killed anyone before.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.227
And speaking as someone
who knows what it means to kill,

32:17.310 --> 32:19.062
you owe yourselves more time

32:19.145 --> 32:22.065
before you do something
you can never take back.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.073
Josh?

32:33.159 --> 32:35.496
<i>9:00 a.m.
You have till then.</i>

32:36.997 --> 32:38.707
[Lasker] They've ended the call.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.084
[Holbrooke] You did
an excellent job, Governor.

32:41.167 --> 32:42.252
[Conway] Thank you.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.921
[news anchor 1] <i>We have a recording</i>
<i>of the Situation Room call</i>

32:45.005 --> 32:47.382
<i>released by the captors a short while ago.</i>

32:47.466 --> 32:49.843
[news anchor 2] <i>Before playing this audio,</i>
<i>we want to warn viewers</i>

32:49.926 --> 32:52.220
<i>that there are sections
that are very disturbing.</i>

32:52.303 --> 32:53.823
<i>You might want to mute the television.</i>

32:56.266 --> 32:59.102
- Where is everybody?
- They all got pulled on the hostage story.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.062
Get 'em back here.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.856
And Maggie Tilden, too.

33:04.274 --> 33:06.401
Transcribe this, right away.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.444
[indistinct chatter]

33:08.529 --> 33:10.280
[Green] Fifty mile radius
outside of Chattanooga.

33:10.363 --> 33:13.483
- Gas purchase on a stolen credit card.
- [Lasker] One of Masterson's classmates.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.326
Should we just release
their photographs at this point?

33:15.410 --> 33:16.620
I'm getting bombarded with calls.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.996
[Lasker] Well, the governor
used the first names.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.122
Someone's gonna put it together.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.166
- [Green] We might as well exploit it.
- Sir.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.836
- [Frank] George.
- Mr. President.

33:24.920 --> 33:29.716
Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider,
but time is in short supply today.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.679
- I can't. Not to my party.
- The party will survive.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.973
Conway might not, but too bad.
He lied.

33:37.057 --> 33:40.561
If I do this to him, I don't survive.
I'm vilified.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.735
I wanna show you something.

33:54.658 --> 33:56.201
[chuckles]

33:57.661 --> 33:59.162
Do you know what this is?

34:00.205 --> 34:02.165
This is your magnet

34:02.248 --> 34:05.043
from the vote count board
when I used to be whip.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.879
There were so many times when

34:07.963 --> 34:10.422
you weren't in the column
I wanted you to be in, George.

34:10.505 --> 34:12.050
And we both know
that I could've forced you

34:12.132 --> 34:14.302
to vote the way
I wanted you to dozens of times,

34:14.385 --> 34:16.888
but I never did.
I held back.

34:16.972 --> 34:20.016
To protect your honor.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.687
And one of the advantages of being whip
is that behind every single member,

34:23.770 --> 34:26.022
behind all of these magnets,

34:26.106 --> 34:31.194
was at least one dishonorable thing.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.447
Yours just happens to be
more dishonorable than most.

34:34.530 --> 34:39.159
So I'm putting you
in my column this time, George.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.837
LeAnn told me you were in here.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.674
I'm working on your statements,
in case the worst happens.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.094
It's tense, this building.

34:57.012 --> 34:59.139
You can feel it in the walls.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.308
I went for a walk earlier.

35:03.351 --> 35:05.228
It was in the air.

35:05.979 --> 35:11.109
People were talking in whispers,
even though there was no reason to.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.196
Or their eyes are glued to their phones.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.534
And there are no children out...

35:20.535 --> 35:21.953
anywhere.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.000
I guess they call it terror for a reason.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.004
Worse than terror.
Dread.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.633
People girding themselves for a tragedy.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.218
Mmm, and it could go the other way.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.387
Hmm.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.891
How are you holding up?

35:44.976 --> 35:48.229
Hannah is minding her children.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.398
- I'm minding her.
- [chuckles]

35:50.941 --> 35:53.359
Her husband really knocked it
out of the ballpark, huh?

35:53.443 --> 35:56.655
Do you think anything he says is genuine?

35:57.197 --> 35:59.908
Doesn't matter, does it?
It worked.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.912
You said once you thought
he was all surface, Conway.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.621
Yeah, a narcissist.

36:05.706 --> 36:10.418
But give him a pool to reflect in...
Watch out.

36:10.501 --> 36:15.006
- He knows exactly what to do with that.
- Unless he overreaches.

36:16.549 --> 36:21.096
Is that what you were hoping?
That he was gonna fuck it up?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.264
Because he's not gonna fuck it up.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.017
He's too smart for that.

36:28.436 --> 36:32.648
"There he soared,
zipping past Big Ben and the London Eye,

36:32.733 --> 36:35.819
over Buckingham Palace
and Piccadilly Circus.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.739
- Look at him go."
- [news anchor speaking indistinctly on TV]

36:38.822 --> 36:40.281
I'll be right back, Charlie.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.075
[news anchor on TV]
<i>...the vigil is especially somber,</i>

36:42.158 --> 36:44.160

Melissa could be heard screaming</i>

- Clear mind.

37:10.812 --> 37:13.148

37:13.231 --> 37:15.734
<i>And every...</i>

37:15.817 --> 37:17.819
[Conway] Oh, why'd you turn it off?

37:18.737 --> 37:20.155
I was there.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.074
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh?

37:23.158 --> 37:25.535
How much good press
I'm getting out of this.

37:25.618 --> 37:26.995
[chuckles]

37:27.078 --> 37:30.123
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.417
Come on, tell me.
I want in on the joke.

37:35.545 --> 37:37.672
You think you can get under my skin.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.466
Oh, I got under your skin
the first time we met.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.260
- When? New Year's?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:42.343 --> 37:45.555
I believe I complimented you that night.
But you go ahead,

37:45.638 --> 37:49.267
you tell yourself what you have to
in order to stand a little taller.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.770
[scoffs] I feel sorry for you.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.775
Two years.
That's all you're gonna get in here.

37:56.858 --> 37:59.485
You're not gonna last
any longer than Walker did.

38:00.486 --> 38:05.826
And what kills you
is that I'll make a great president.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.079
The kind of president
who'll actually be remembered.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.833
And isn't that worse than dying, Frank?

38:15.001 --> 38:16.669
Being forgotten.

38:17.587 --> 38:18.713
[Conway sighs]

38:19.881 --> 38:22.633
You actually think
you'd make a great president.

38:22.717 --> 38:26.221
Mmm. Today was just a little taste.

38:26.304 --> 38:30.766
99% of this job is in the dark.

38:30.851 --> 38:33.895
I mean, you had
your little moment in the sun today,

38:33.979 --> 38:37.107
but what are you gonna do when you have
to make a thousand decisions

38:37.190 --> 38:39.818
that no one will ever
hear about or appreciate?

38:39.901 --> 38:42.445
I think you're excellent
at running for the president,

38:42.528 --> 38:45.115
but I don't think you're equipped
to actually be one.

38:45.198 --> 38:47.826
Don't be condescending.
I'm the Governor of New York.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.203
Ooh, Albany, really?

38:52.873 --> 38:55.541
You're a pretender, Will.

38:55.625 --> 39:00.130
And if you win,
you'll go from pretender to fraud.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.384
[Hannah] Will?

39:05.760 --> 39:09.472
Uh... I'm putting the kids to bed.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.100
Don't let me keep you.

39:22.735 --> 39:24.946
[Hannah speaking indistinctly]

39:25.030 --> 39:26.072
[kissing]

39:27.490 --> 39:30.201
- Maybe you should send them home.
- No, not yet.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.538
Do you have something else in mind
besides Walleck?

39:33.621 --> 39:35.957
Yes, and I'll need your help.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.626
Charlie?
Have you seen him?

39:38.709 --> 39:40.378
Charlie?

39:40.461 --> 39:41.922
Mommy, look what I found!

39:43.048 --> 39:44.757
Oh, look at those.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.802
[Frank] Give those back.
Those aren't yours to play with.

39:47.886 --> 39:51.681
- Can I keep them?
- Oh, um, hand them over, Charlie.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.975
- [Conway] Charles.
- No, you know what?

39:54.059 --> 39:55.268
You should keep them,

39:55.351 --> 39:58.854
because you should get
everything you want in this life.

39:58.939 --> 40:01.566
[chuckles] Um, say thank you.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.694
- Thank you.
- No, thank you

40:04.777 --> 40:07.613
for coming to the White House to visit us.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.615
We should get some rest.
I'll see you at 7:00.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.284
Oh, I'll be up way before then.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.953
- Good night.
- [Claire] Good night.

40:13.036 --> 40:14.162
[Conway] Good night.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.335
You need my help how?

40:21.377 --> 40:24.339
- Who else knows about this?
- [Claire] No one.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.551
I'll need you to make arrangements
as quietly as possible.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.761
All right, I'm on it.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.763
I'll let you know
as soon as I have a location.

40:33.306 --> 40:36.142
Good. Then go home
and get a few hours of sleep.

40:36.226 --> 40:39.020
[scoffs] I can't sleep tonight.

40:39.104 --> 40:42.523
You should try.
We'll need you fresh in the morning.

40:53.659 --> 40:54.869
[phone beeps]

40:54.953 --> 40:58.123
- Get me the Chairman Joint Chiefs.
- [secretary] <i>Yes, sir.</i>

41:04.045 --> 41:05.421
<i>He's on the line, sir.</i>

41:07.966 --> 41:09.009
Mr. Chairman.

41:09.092 --> 41:12.387
When do you wanna reach out
to the White House?

41:12.470 --> 41:15.140
[Tom] Tomorrow.
I've drafted the email.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.602
- You looked this over?
- Yes. We're okay on the legal front.

41:19.685 --> 41:22.147
But shouldn't we wait
until this crisis is over first?

41:22.230 --> 41:25.233
No. This is perfect timing for us.

41:25.316 --> 41:29.070
Tom's right.
Let's hit him while he's distracted.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.823
- [water running]
- [dishes clattering]

41:36.786 --> 41:38.454
[sighs] How is it?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.207
Perfect.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.084
Well, you didn't have much
to work with in your fridge.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.628
You need to do some grocery shopping.

41:45.711 --> 41:48.673
- I don't cook a lot.
- [chuckles] Obviously.

41:53.969 --> 41:57.098
- If you have to get back to your kids...
- No, it's fine.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.517
Haley's 16.
She'll call me if she needs anything.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.727
Have they been watching the news?

42:01.811 --> 42:04.647
Yeah...
and they're freaked out by it.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.692
I mean, who isn't?
But they've got thick skin by now.

42:07.775 --> 42:10.070
Handling it a lot better
than some of their friends.

42:10.153 --> 42:11.237
I know a lot of parents

42:11.321 --> 42:13.561
aren't even letting their kids
out of the house tomorrow.

42:13.614 --> 42:15.283
Not even to go to school.
[scoffs]

42:15.366 --> 42:17.118
My kids are gonna go, though.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.454
I'm not gonna let these monsters
rule over our lives.

42:21.956 --> 42:25.251
- Thanks for coming over.
- Of course.

42:25.335 --> 42:28.379
I know I'd just be staring
at the ceiling if I tried to sleep.

42:28.463 --> 42:31.132
Well, you have a lot on your shoulders.

42:32.467 --> 42:36.929
Yeah, normally, I'd go to a meeting.
I... I just, uh...

42:37.012 --> 42:39.390
You just wanted someone
to take care of you.

42:40.891 --> 42:43.894
And it's nice to take care of someone.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.441
Good morning, Governor.

42:58.118 --> 42:59.869
[cell phone ringing]

43:02.538 --> 43:03.831
[Laura] Your phone.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.167
[clears throat]

43:08.128 --> 43:09.170
Hello?

43:09.254 --> 43:13.299
We have video of a car at an intersection
near Chatsworth, Georgia.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.593
The bird song,
deep background from the phone call,

43:15.676 --> 43:17.887
puts them in a wooded area.
Southern Blue Ridge.

43:17.970 --> 43:21.015
<i>We started canvassing now.
FBI, state troopers.</i>

43:37.365 --> 43:39.617
The line is open.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.661
Uh, okay.
Where... where's my script?

43:41.744 --> 43:42.787
I'll be doing the talking.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.710
I'll let you know
if I want you to participate.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.416
Sir, if we've established a dialogue

43:46.499 --> 43:48.126
between the kidnappers and the governor,
we should...

43:48.209 --> 43:49.752
Start the call.
