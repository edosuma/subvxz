Thank you all for coming.
I apologize for the security protocols.

But my better half insists.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.838
Just the fact that you are
all here is a testament...

01:35.012 --> 01:39.631
...to the deep concern we share for
Elizabeth Keen's safety and well-being.

01:40.058 --> 01:45.178
The threat from forces within is proving
to be more powerful and far-reaching...

01:45.355 --> 01:47.471
...than one could ever have imagined.

But such is life. Here we are.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.506
80 five weeks ago,
I called the Metro PD to report...

02:18.680 --> 02:21.171
...a sighting of Reddington
at the Del Rio diner.

02:22.100 --> 02:25.467
I created a hostage crisis so you
would be so kind as to...

02:25.687 --> 02:28.804
...re/ease my attorney,
Marvin Gerard, from prison.

02:29.024 --> 02:33.438
That day, Marvin and l conceived
a plan to exonerate Elizabeth Keen...

02:33.612 --> 02:37.230
...by targeting the Cabal
and, in particular, the Director.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.031
Since that day, everything we've done...

02:40.202 --> 02:44.696
...has been in service of that plan.
The Verdiant case resulted in...

02:44.915 --> 02:47.327
...catastrophic damage to
the Cabal's ﬁnances.

02:47.542 --> 02:51.706
The client list from the Djinn gave us
leverage with key players in the Cabal...

02:51.922 --> 02:55.915
...to further isolate and weaken
the Director's influence.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.671
With Andras Halmi, or part of him...

02:58.887 --> 03:01.629
...we cut a hole
in the Director’s golden parachute...

03:01.848 --> 03:03.930
...leaving him nothing to run with...

03:04.101 --> 03:08.470
...and causing even further distrust
and divisions within the Cabal.

03:08.689 --> 03:13.058
But the Zal Bin Haasan case
has opened a window of opportunity...

03:13.235 --> 03:15.817
...we must slip through
with great haste.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.692
To save Elizabeth,
we must execute a specific attack.

03:19.908 --> 03:25.619
One so impactful, it will force the Cabal
to completely abandon the Director...

03:25.789 --> 03:28.531
...and publicly
exonerate Elizabeth Keen.
