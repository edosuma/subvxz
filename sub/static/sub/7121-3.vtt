00:34.601 --> 00:36.968
Faster! She's in danger!

00:37.037 --> 00:38.699
Who is he talking about?

00:38.772 --> 00:40.297
I have no idea.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.535
What?! Then why am
I running so hard?

00:42.609 --> 00:43.872
Because...

00:43.943 --> 00:46.606
Because she's in trouble!

00:46.679 --> 00:47.942
Who is?

00:48.014 --> 00:50.108
Marceline!

00:50.183 --> 00:51.276
Faster, Jake!

00:51.351 --> 00:54.253
She's in trouble!

00:57.424 --> 01:00.053
Hey, wizard, how do
you know Marceline?

01:00.126 --> 01:03.324
I'm... her spirit animal.

01:03.396 --> 01:08.733
Oh.

01:10.503 --> 01:12.369
Marceline! What's
wrong with her?!

01:12.439 --> 01:15.603
She accidentally cast a
sleep spell on herself,

01:15.675 --> 01:18.873
and now she's trapped
in eternal slumber.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.470
Tell us how to break the spell.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.381
I'll transport you
into Marceline's mind,

01:23.450 --> 01:25.919
where you will walk
through her memories

01:25.985 --> 01:28.580
and find the memory core.

01:28.655 --> 01:29.782
Then what?

01:29.856 --> 01:31.620
Find the memory of Marceline

01:31.691 --> 01:34.559
casting the sleep
spell on herself.

01:34.627 --> 01:36.789
At your touch, you
and the memory

01:36.863 --> 01:40.231
will be transported
back to reality.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.791
But, like, if you know all this,

01:41.868 --> 01:43.598
why not just do it yourself?

01:43.670 --> 01:47.198
Entering a person's
mind can be dangerous,

01:47.273 --> 01:49.208
and I don't have any arms...
just legs.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.543
Oh, yeah. Here we go.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.980
Ungh!

01:56.049 --> 01:57.881
What?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.647
What did you do to my forehead?

01:59.719 --> 02:01.745
When you get close
to the memory,

02:01.821 --> 02:05.121
your forehead will glow.

02:05.191 --> 02:06.682
Here. Take this.

02:06.759 --> 02:08.728
It's a sack of magic powder.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.425
Sit on the couch and sprinkle
the powder on your head.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.468
Like this?

02:14.534 --> 02:17.265
Yep. Like that. Feel sleepy?

02:18.338 --> 02:19.169
Mm-hmm.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.231
Good. Sleep now.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.775
- But know this!
- Huh?!

02:22.842 --> 02:24.936
If you fail,

02:25.011 --> 02:29.073
Marceline will be trapped
in eternal sleep...

02:29.149 --> 02:30.583
forever!

02:31.584 --> 02:34.782
And ever! And ever!

02:44.898 --> 02:46.366
Did it work?

02:46.432 --> 02:48.298
I-I can't tell.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.735
I don't feel like I'm inside
Marceline's memories.

02:50.803 --> 02:52.271
Me neither.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.671
Huh?

02:55.742 --> 02:56.742
Whoa!

03:01.114 --> 03:02.114
Whoa!

03:02.182 --> 03:04.481
So... if we're in
Marceline's memories,

03:04.551 --> 03:07.020
where's Marceline?

03:07.086 --> 03:08.452
Hmm.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.887
There she is!

03:09.956 --> 03:12.255
Hey, Li'l Marcy.

03:12.325 --> 03:13.623
Who are you guys?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.958
- We're Finn and Jake.
- We're your friends.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.930
Hambo is my only friend.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.296
See?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.097
You need another
eyeball surgery, pal.

03:23.169 --> 03:26.435
Lucky for you, we found a donor.

03:26.506 --> 03:28.407
Eyeball!

03:28.474 --> 03:29.942
Nurse, hand me the string.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.807
Yes, doctor.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.370
It's our last piece.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.447
Hold still.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.809
I'm hurting you
because I love you.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.483
What are you guys
still doing here?

03:42.555 --> 03:43.784
We're trying to wake you up.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.848
Do you know where
your memory core is?

03:45.925 --> 03:46.925
Nope.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.691
But there might be anything
behind that cellar door.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.663
And it rhymes with
"memory core."

03:51.731 --> 03:52.562
Ooh! Ooh!

03:52.632 --> 03:54.191
Could be jams and
pickles down there!

03:54.267 --> 03:56.202
Weird.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.295
I think this door leads
to a new memory...

03:58.371 --> 04:00.533
with food in it.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.667
Ooh! Ice cream!

04:02.742 --> 04:04.074
I want some!

04:04.143 --> 04:05.143
Huh?

04:14.220 --> 04:15.779
Come on, Finn.

04:24.564 --> 04:25.395
Yo, man.

04:25.465 --> 04:26.228
Wha?!

04:26.299 --> 04:27.299
Don't eat those.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.537
Bluh!

04:31.604 --> 04:32.833
Marceline!

04:33.906 --> 04:35.465
Daddy? Why?

04:35.541 --> 04:38.272
Hmm. - What?

04:38.344 --> 04:39.573
It's our tree house.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.740
This must be when
Marceline lived here.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.275
Easy. Easy.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.546
You got it?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.018
Yeah.

04:47.086 --> 04:48.086
Aah!

04:48.655 --> 04:51.090
I'm so glad we're
doing this, Ash.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.887
Yeah, me too.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.450
Oh, hey. Wait. Watch this.

04:54.527 --> 04:55.756
I've been practicing.

04:57.397 --> 04:58.990
Marceween!

04:59.065 --> 05:01.762
I wuv! I wuv!

05:01.834 --> 05:03.359
Oh, Ash.

05:05.872 --> 05:07.568
Who's this guy supposed to be?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.404
Ash, I guess.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.015
This place reeks.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.677
Yo, man. Your thing is glowing.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.778
My what? Oh, my thing.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.550
We must be close to the core.

05:23.623 --> 05:25.182
I see another door over there.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.317
Come on.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.451
Wait a sec, Jake.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.551
It's that guy again.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.187
Hey. O-Open your eyes.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.196
Look at this, Mar-Mar.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.926
Check it out. It's my new wand.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.467
These cherry blossoms... look.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.469
Look as close as you
can, and they're real.

05:37.603 --> 05:38.730
Wow. Awesome.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.382
Where'd you get the
money for that thing?

05:40.406 --> 05:42.875
Oh, I sold that teddy bear
that you love so much...

05:42.942 --> 05:44.774
to a witch.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.177
You what?! Are you crazy?!

05:47.246 --> 05:49.181
That was my favorite thing
in the whole world!

05:49.248 --> 05:51.479
That's why it's so
valuable, genius...

05:51.551 --> 05:53.816
For potions.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.047
You're not...

05:55.121 --> 05:56.714
a genius.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.018
You're not...

05:58.091 --> 05:59.252
a genius.

05:59.325 --> 06:00.793
That's the last straw, Ash!

06:00.860 --> 06:01.953
That's it!

06:02.929 --> 06:05.091
You're a psycho jerk, and
you've ruined my life!

06:05.164 --> 06:07.429
But... but not all of it!

06:07.500 --> 06:09.196
It's over, you psycho!

06:12.071 --> 06:13.733
This way, Finn!

06:13.806 --> 06:15.968
Check out this whacked-out
memory crack!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.705
It's banaenae down here!

06:24.317 --> 06:26.582
The core!

06:27.653 --> 06:29.679
All these orbs must
be her memories!

06:29.756 --> 06:31.567
- How are we supposed to
know which one to grab?

06:31.591 --> 06:33.457
- Play "hot/cold"
with your forehead.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.519
- All right. Hot or cold?

06:36.596 --> 06:37.596
- Cold.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.222
Definitely cold.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.866
Warmer.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.266
Hyup! Ungh!

06:43.336 --> 06:45.305
Warmer.

06:45.371 --> 06:46.862
Warmer!

06:46.939 --> 06:48.567
Whoa! Hot!

06:48.641 --> 06:50.234
Hot, hot, hot!

06:50.309 --> 06:55.748
That must be the one!

07:00.219 --> 07:01.710
Wha?

07:01.788 --> 07:03.654
Hey! You have arms!

07:03.723 --> 07:05.749
That's right, genius.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.020
Huh?

07:07.093 --> 07:08.391
You lied to us!

07:08.461 --> 07:13.024
Ah, the important thing
is Marceline's awake.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.800
Marcy! Marcy!

07:18.871 --> 07:20.533
You're okay!

07:20.606 --> 07:21.869
Quit touching my hair!

07:21.941 --> 07:23.466
You had a magic accident,

07:23.543 --> 07:24.783
and we saved you with some help

07:24.844 --> 07:25.844
from your wizard friend.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.210
That's Ash.

07:27.280 --> 07:27.975
Ash?!

07:28.047 --> 07:29.047
He's not my friend.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.481
He's my boyfriend!

07:30.550 --> 07:31.813
What?!

07:31.884 --> 07:33.318
That's right, babe.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.386
Ash, what's going on?

07:34.454 --> 07:37.322
Just picking up my girl for
a night on the town...

07:37.390 --> 07:39.256
at my place.

07:40.426 --> 07:41.689
Aw, that's sweet.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.655
What?!

07:43.729 --> 07:45.630
Oh, grow up, you guys.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.189
I'm gonna go freshen up.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.529
That's a relief.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.734
Oh, Ash.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.773
Wha-a-a-a-t?!

07:53.840 --> 07:55.775
Don't you guys get it?

07:55.842 --> 07:58.073
I out-brained you.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.113
That wasn't the memory
of a sleep spell

08:00.179 --> 08:01.579
you brought me.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.549
That memory was our breakup!

08:04.617 --> 08:06.245
It's over, you psycho!

08:07.620 --> 08:08.644
That's enough of that.

08:08.721 --> 08:09.984
Oh, no!

08:10.056 --> 08:11.056
What?!

08:11.090 --> 08:11.853
Yup.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.964
Come on, Mar-Mar. Let's go.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.755
No! Marceline!

08:14.827 --> 08:16.728
Ashicus flyicus.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.591
They're gone, man! He took her!

08:22.668 --> 08:24.398
Don't worry, Finn!
I got the scent!

08:28.074 --> 08:29.074
Follow me.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.475
This is it?

08:32.544 --> 08:34.138
I can smell 'em in there.

08:34.212 --> 08:35.236
So, what's the plan?

08:35.313 --> 08:37.044
Um...

08:37.116 --> 08:38.379
okay, you take that shovel

08:38.451 --> 08:40.682
and keep banging it
against that shed

08:40.753 --> 08:42.517
till Ash comes out to
see what's happening.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.955
Then I'll sneak in, and
I'll rescue Marceline.

08:45.024 --> 08:50.190
Nice.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.068
Aah! My house!
What's happening?!

08:56.135 --> 08:57.228
Wha?

08:57.303 --> 08:59.033
No! Don't hurt me!

08:59.105 --> 09:00.698
No! No, sorry! Ju...

09:02.608 --> 09:04.509
Shh! Shh! Wait!

09:04.577 --> 09:06.808
Aah! Help! Somebody help me!

09:06.879 --> 09:08.780
What's all this hullabaloo?!

09:08.848 --> 09:10.248
Help! Help!

09:10.316 --> 09:11.875
Hey, hold it!

09:11.951 --> 09:13.476
You! Get back here!

09:15.588 --> 09:17.113
Oof!

09:18.658 --> 09:19.858
Finn? Finn, what are you doing?

09:19.926 --> 09:21.155
You can't be here.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.355
Ash doesn't like me hanging
out with mere mortals.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.022
Yeah. Okay.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.157
Sorry, Marceline. I'll go.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.328
I've just got to show
you something first.

09:33.906 --> 09:34.906
Pbtbtbtbtbtbtbt!

09:39.779 --> 09:41.771

Hey, there you are.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.627
Finn, what's going on?

10:04.704 --> 10:06.002
What is this place?

10:06.072 --> 10:07.438
It's my old house.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.634
That magic powder put
you in my memories.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.007
Me and Jake were
in yours before,

10:11.077 --> 10:12.797
but Ash tricked us into
stealing your memory

10:12.845 --> 10:14.507
of breaking up with him.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.106
But it's okay, 'cause I
saw the missing memory.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.550
Now I have a memory of
your memory in my memory.
