WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.667
Grace, how long were you up on the roof?

00:02.700 --> 00:04.168
A few hours.

00:04.202 --> 00:06.471
It was just getting light
when we came down.

00:06.504 --> 00:09.774
And after you found Molly,
what did you do?

00:09.808 --> 00:12.310
Grace, what did you do?

00:13.404 --> 00:15.202

00:38.107 --> 00:39.141
Let's get out of here.

00:39.174 --> 00:40.661
Go back to the flat.

02:10.570 --> 02:12.305
Last night was wild.

02:12.338 --> 02:14.774
Mmm, so are you.

02:16.459 --> 02:18.328
Is that why I feel like crap?

02:20.755 --> 02:21.965
Come on.

02:21.999 --> 02:23.146
I'll get you a coffee.

02:34.709 --> 02:35.742
Roz.

02:35.776 --> 02:37.166
Hey.

02:37.191 --> 02:40.228
Me and Molly invited some people
back from the club last night,

02:40.253 --> 02:42.725
so it might be a little trashed.

02:43.717 --> 02:44.734
Okay.

02:45.223 --> 02:46.456
Hmm.

02:52.584 --> 02:54.478
You and Molly are cleaning this up.

02:54.512 --> 02:55.366
I know.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.083
Ooh, watch the glass, babe.

02:59.117 --> 03:00.786
Aw, what a mess.

03:00.818 --> 03:02.436
Gross.

03:03.088 --> 03:05.156
Molly, get up.

03:05.432 --> 03:07.398
We're in trouble.

03:11.529 --> 03:14.500
Come on, wake up.

03:22.052 --> 03:24.120
I think somebody got lucky.

03:24.154 --> 03:27.959
Then I guess you get to do
all the fun bits yourself.

03:29.903 --> 03:31.406
I'll help you.

03:33.091 --> 03:34.592
Where are the trash bags?

03:35.165 --> 03:38.035
Uh, in the laundry room?

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

04:08.480 --> 04:10.849
Sir, bloody awful scene.

04:10.882 --> 04:12.850
Victim's a 22-year-old female.

04:12.884 --> 04:14.094
Molly Ryan.

04:14.128 --> 04:15.987
Look, I know I exude authority,

04:16.021 --> 04:17.790
but DS Bruno's finally
out of short pants.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.524
He's the primary on this one.

04:19.557 --> 04:20.825
"Authority"?

04:20.858 --> 04:21.993
Sorry, mate.

04:22.026 --> 04:23.127
You just look old.

04:25.672 --> 04:27.066
The victim's body's
just through there, sir.

04:45.884 --> 04:47.565
Victim was discovered by her flatmates

04:47.599 --> 04:49.353
and one of their boyfriends.

04:49.386 --> 04:51.308
Bloke's a foreigner; French.

04:51.342 --> 04:52.973
That one there's American.

04:53.006 --> 04:55.015
The only local's the one
with the rainbow in her hair.

04:57.562 --> 04:58.989
Circus just pulled in.

04:59.021 --> 04:59.997
Detective Sergeant?

05:00.031 --> 05:02.567
- Yeah?
- The luminol test showed blood

05:02.600 --> 05:04.336
leading from the victim up to the roof.

05:04.369 --> 05:07.261
We found trace amounts
on the American girl's feet.

05:18.129 --> 05:19.718
What were you and Luc doing

05:19.751 --> 05:21.053
up on the roof last night?

05:21.086 --> 05:22.687
We're not here to hassle you, Grace.

05:22.720 --> 05:23.855
We just need all the facts
so we can find out

05:23.889 --> 05:25.189
what happened to Molly.

05:25.223 --> 05:26.925
If you were doing drugs,

05:26.958 --> 05:28.059
or anything like that,
you ain't gonna get

05:28.093 --> 05:29.394
in trouble for it.

05:29.427 --> 05:31.095
We did some X.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.865
And then we fooled around.

05:32.898 --> 05:34.194
So once you went up on the roof,

05:34.226 --> 05:35.539
you didn't come down till morning?

05:37.195 --> 05:38.336
No.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.807
After you found Molly, what did you do?

05:44.213 --> 05:46.345
Grace, what did you do?

05:48.907 --> 05:50.239
I think I went to the bathroom.

05:50.272 --> 05:51.621
After you found your roommate?

05:51.898 --> 05:53.667
No... last night.

05:53.819 --> 05:55.153
I'm... I'm not sure.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.956
But I... I think
I might've come down to pee.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.959
I was really out of it.

06:01.493 --> 06:02.628
But I sort of remember

06:02.660 --> 06:04.963
walking through the flat in the dark.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.297
Everyone was gone.

06:08.266 --> 06:10.636
Oh, my God.

06:10.668 --> 06:12.349
Do you think he was there?

06:14.197 --> 06:15.807
In the flat with me?

06:15.841 --> 06:18.776
Okay, Grace, let's just, um,
focus in on some

06:18.809 --> 06:20.345
easier questions for a sec.

06:20.377 --> 06:21.846
Like, um,

06:21.879 --> 06:22.980
Molly's cell phone...

06:23.457 --> 06:24.498
do you know where that is?

06:26.381 --> 06:28.586
- You didn't find it in the flat?
- No.

06:28.619 --> 06:29.954
I don't know.

06:29.987 --> 06:33.324
Maybe... Molly left it in the club?

06:33.909 --> 06:34.959
She's always losing stuff.

06:34.992 --> 06:36.761
Like what?

06:37.670 --> 06:39.031
Little things.

06:39.064 --> 06:40.199
Her perfume.

06:40.854 --> 06:42.401
This ratty old T-shirt she sleeps...

06:45.845 --> 06:46.805
...slept in.

06:47.580 --> 06:48.874
So Molly was

06:48.906 --> 06:50.374
what... careless? Forgetful?

06:50.408 --> 06:52.377
Yeah, I guess.

06:52.410 --> 06:54.419
At first, she thought Roz and I
were messing with her.

06:55.235 --> 06:56.981
Then she started to get freaked out

06:57.014 --> 06:58.950
- that someone was watching her.
- "Watching her."

06:58.983 --> 07:00.117
- Yeah.
- Where?

07:00.151 --> 07:01.619
- I don't know.
- At home? The club?

07:01.653 --> 07:02.855
I don't know. I don't know!

07:02.887 --> 07:04.121
What I'm saying is she thought

07:04.155 --> 07:05.524
she had a stalker or something,
like someone

07:05.557 --> 07:07.376
was breaking in and taking her stuff.

07:07.822 --> 07:08.765
She thought that?

07:13.932 --> 07:16.001
You should've pushed
harder on the footprints.

07:16.534 --> 07:18.069
You were watching?

07:18.103 --> 07:19.905
This case is gonna have
everyone's eyes on it.

07:19.937 --> 07:21.038
Where are we?

07:21.071 --> 07:22.139
We can place at least 23 people

07:22.172 --> 07:23.507
in that flat last night.

07:23.540 --> 07:24.877
Still need to run them down.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.078
Of the three that found her,

07:26.110 --> 07:28.045
the DJ's alibi checks out.

07:28.079 --> 07:29.581
Hundreds of people put her

07:29.614 --> 07:30.883
at the club until 5:00. The other two

07:30.915 --> 07:33.017
swear they were on the roof all night,

07:33.050 --> 07:35.401
except when Grace came down to pee.

07:35.795 --> 07:37.189
You bought that story?

07:37.221 --> 07:39.091
She didn't realize
she was walking through blood?

07:39.638 --> 07:41.026
If you're that wasted, maybe.

07:41.059 --> 07:42.594
Or she's a stone-cold
sociopath... cheers.

07:42.627 --> 07:45.529
In which case, she would've done
a better job of cleaning up.

07:45.562 --> 07:47.199
Do you want me to hold her?

07:50.035 --> 07:52.237
Yeah, I didn't think so,
Madam Prosecutor.

07:53.538 --> 07:55.374
Listen, Detective Sergeant,

07:55.406 --> 07:57.036
we need to get this right.

08:07.819 --> 08:10.545
Why does a normally law-abiding
person turn to murder?

08:10.639 --> 08:12.574
In some cases,
we'll never know the answer.

08:12.866 --> 08:15.359
But here, the reason is simple...

08:15.392 --> 08:16.588
Sorry, sweetheart.

08:27.305 --> 08:29.790
Evil hides behind many faces.

08:29.815 --> 08:30.981
Even an attractive one,

08:31.014 --> 08:32.686
like the defendant.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.413
He wants you to believe
that his wife's death

08:34.447 --> 08:36.337
was just a tragic accident.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.818
And accidents happen.

08:39.421 --> 08:41.154
Just this morning, on my way to court,

08:41.187 --> 08:44.515
I slammed on the breaks
and my coffee went flying.

08:48.983 --> 08:50.297
That was an accident.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.665
This...

08:52.984 --> 08:54.186
This was murder.

08:56.522 --> 08:59.097
This man blew his wife's brains out

08:59.938 --> 09:01.890
to save himself some alimony.

09:02.594 --> 09:04.689
He deserves to be punished.

09:07.860 --> 09:08.893
Thank you.

09:09.915 --> 09:11.083
Nice job, Atwood.

09:11.116 --> 09:13.086
Told you we didn't need to plead it out.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.388
Yeah, well, don't gloat too long.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.122
You gotta start prepping
that double homicide

09:16.155 --> 09:16.979
at Back Bay.

09:17.761 --> 09:19.597
I thought that case was too big for me.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.632
I thought it was, too. Until today.

09:22.909 --> 09:25.444
Oh... don't make me regret my decision.

09:36.414 --> 09:37.249
Hey, Grace.

09:37.281 --> 09:38.746
Sorry, I've been in court all day.

09:40.518 --> 09:42.253
Honey, slow down.

09:42.286 --> 09:43.821
I-I can't understand you.

09:44.253 --> 09:45.657
What happened?

09:48.161 --> 09:49.729
Cause of death was exsanguination

09:49.762 --> 09:51.531
due to a slit carotid artery.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.233
I also count 17 stab wounds,

09:54.267 --> 09:56.369
consistent with the knife
found at the scene.

09:57.778 --> 09:59.147
Mainly in the abdomen, with a handful

09:59.181 --> 10:01.799
in the chest, legs and upper arms.

10:04.118 --> 10:06.088
I can't stop seeing her like that.

10:07.682 --> 10:08.590
Luc?

10:10.124 --> 10:12.494
Can you just not do that right now?

10:12.971 --> 10:14.095
Please.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.416
Stop.

10:32.503 --> 10:33.605
Was she raped?

10:33.638 --> 10:34.906
Can't say for sure.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.563
And there's no trace of semen.

10:36.596 --> 10:39.706
If she was raped, your
killer took precautions.

10:45.653 --> 10:46.747
So, no DNA?

10:47.273 --> 10:49.992
Well, someone left
some DNA in your victim.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.739
Molly Ryan was pregnant.

11:05.406 --> 11:07.041
Grace.

11:08.975 --> 11:10.171
Grace!

11:13.914 --> 11:15.534
I missed you in class this morning.

11:16.935 --> 11:19.942
I'm so sorry about Molly.

11:20.587 --> 11:23.048
It's a horrible shock. A horrible loss.

11:23.672 --> 11:24.673
Yeah.

11:25.590 --> 11:26.660
Now, what can I do, Grace?

11:26.693 --> 11:27.806
How can I help you through this?

11:27.839 --> 11:28.617
I'm fine.

11:32.878 --> 11:34.463
You know, grief is a heavy thing.

11:35.361 --> 11:37.960
You need to give yourself
permission to mourn.

11:40.716 --> 11:42.176
How about you, Professor?

11:42.650 --> 11:44.505
Will you be mourning Molly?

12:30.143 --> 12:30.879
What's wrong?

12:30.912 --> 12:32.147
Oh...

12:32.180 --> 12:33.415
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

12:33.447 --> 12:34.749
Hey.

12:34.782 --> 12:36.051
Oh, Luc.

12:36.084 --> 12:37.118
Oh, my God.

12:37.151 --> 12:38.248
Someone was...

12:38.280 --> 12:39.323
someone was following me.

12:39.348 --> 12:41.015
- Where?
- On Tower Bridge.

12:41.521 --> 12:42.336
You saw someone?

12:42.369 --> 12:43.370
I don't know. May...

12:43.403 --> 12:44.705
Maybe?

12:44.738 --> 12:47.141
Somebody was there... behind me.

12:47.173 --> 12:48.375
We should get out of here.

12:48.408 --> 12:49.376
I don't want to go back out there.

12:49.409 --> 12:50.510
What? No.

12:50.543 --> 12:52.413
We can take the first train
to Paris in the morning.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.870
Crash with my friends.

12:55.488 --> 12:57.690
My sister's coming;
I can't just take off.

12:57.723 --> 12:59.392
Text her.

12:59.425 --> 13:01.599
Tell her to meet us there.
She'll understand.

13:02.328 --> 13:05.195
Come on. Grace.

13:05.797 --> 13:07.099
Let's just go.

13:13.142 --> 13:14.980
Hey! Bruno!

13:15.538 --> 13:16.526
Where are you off to?

13:16.559 --> 13:18.195
Serving the warrant on Club Diablo,

13:18.228 --> 13:19.564
you know, where Molly Ryan
was partying on...

13:19.597 --> 13:20.912
I've already served it.

13:20.937 --> 13:21.753
What?!

13:22.565 --> 13:23.800
Are you a detective?

13:23.833 --> 13:25.402
Or are you a prosecutor?

13:25.435 --> 13:27.077
'Cause I don't remember
ever trying your cases for you.

13:27.110 --> 13:27.836
Shut up.

13:28.580 --> 13:29.581
Watch.

13:32.222 --> 13:34.219
Oh, hello.

13:35.092 --> 13:38.062
Do you think Grace knew
she and Molly were sharing toys?

13:38.094 --> 13:40.545
Grace? This looks way worse for Luc.

13:40.607 --> 13:42.553
Maybe he's the one who knocked Molly up.

13:42.578 --> 13:43.879
Maybe he didn't want to play Daddy.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.960
Or maybe Grace lost it

13:45.985 --> 13:47.703
when she found out Molly was
carrying her boyfriend's baby.

13:47.807 --> 13:50.410
Molly was stabbed 17 times.

13:50.444 --> 13:52.746
Do you really think that's
the work of a jealous girl?

13:52.778 --> 13:55.048
Never underestimate jealous girls.

13:57.449 --> 13:58.541
All right.

13:59.117 --> 14:00.219
I'll bring 'em both back in.

14:13.098 --> 14:15.399
Luc, open the door, this is the police.

14:16.267 --> 14:18.370
Luc, open the door.

14:18.403 --> 14:19.622
Excuse me.

14:20.057 --> 14:21.259
Do you know the French guy
that lives there?

14:21.293 --> 14:23.294
He left a bit ago with some girl.

14:23.327 --> 14:24.697
Did he say where he was going?

14:24.730 --> 14:26.298
He had a suitcase with him.

14:26.331 --> 14:27.932
They're running.

14:27.966 --> 14:29.567
All right, I'll ping their phones.

14:29.601 --> 14:30.769
They won't get far.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.196
Excuse me. What are you doing in here?

15:17.230 --> 15:19.086
You can't be in here. Tom? Tom!

15:19.282 --> 15:21.017
What is she doing? Get her out!

15:21.049 --> 15:22.022
What happened here?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.120
What rag are you working for, lady?

15:24.153 --> 15:25.255
I'm not a reporter.

15:25.288 --> 15:27.289
This is Luc Pascal's apartment, right?

15:27.322 --> 15:29.726
I'm supposed to meet my sister here.

15:29.759 --> 15:31.360
Grace Atwood.

15:31.394 --> 15:33.096
You're Grace's sister.

15:33.129 --> 15:34.430
Do you know where she might be?

15:34.462 --> 15:36.399
We talked right before
I got on the plane.

15:36.432 --> 15:37.634
She said she'd be here.

15:37.667 --> 15:38.633
We'd like to ask her

15:38.665 --> 15:40.469
and her boyfriend a few questions.

15:40.495 --> 15:43.236
A few questions?
That why you got CSI here?

15:43.686 --> 15:46.035
Do you consider my sister
some kind of a suspect?

15:46.068 --> 15:46.953
This is a mistake.

15:46.986 --> 15:48.561
I can assure you, she hasn't
done anything wrong.

15:48.796 --> 15:50.797
If your sister is so innocent,

15:50.830 --> 15:52.899
why is she on the run?

15:54.701 --> 15:57.470
Attention all Paris-bound passengers...

15:59.873 --> 16:02.977
Attention, all Paris-bound passengers:

16:03.009 --> 16:04.110
Please board on track...

16:09.945 --> 16:11.213
Rail service to Paris

16:11.245 --> 16:13.715
is leaving from platform five.

16:14.316 --> 16:16.118
Please board your train.

16:17.624 --> 16:18.691
Looking for one French male,

16:18.716 --> 16:21.020
one American female.

16:23.051 --> 16:24.351
Gonna double back.

16:24.385 --> 16:27.122
- Luc, we need to go.
- We are going, baby.

16:27.155 --> 16:28.423
No, look.

16:28.456 --> 16:30.192
We need to get off this train.

16:30.225 --> 16:31.293
Where are you going?

16:34.228 --> 16:35.129
- You'll just make it worse.
- Move! Move!

16:35.162 --> 16:36.697
Luc, come on.

16:36.731 --> 16:38.733
- Luc, Luc, please. Luc!
- Babe...

16:38.765 --> 16:40.201
We're here in car 15!

16:40.235 --> 16:41.235
Grace Atwood! Luc Pascal!

16:41.268 --> 16:43.137
Stay where you are!

16:45.225 --> 16:46.593
Do you like blood, Luc?

16:46.627 --> 16:48.758
I'm no art expert, but it seems to me

16:48.876 --> 16:49.844
that whoever did these

16:49.877 --> 16:51.479
is someone who really...

16:51.512 --> 16:53.930
loves... blood.

16:54.234 --> 16:55.837
And maybe you got tired
of the fake stuff,

16:55.869 --> 16:57.522
and maybe you wanted
to see the real thing.

16:58.071 --> 16:59.706
It's just art.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.976
How well did you know Molly?

17:02.009 --> 17:03.561
She was Grace's roommate.

17:03.704 --> 17:04.704
So you'd never hung out with Molly

17:04.737 --> 17:06.040
before you hooked up with Grace?

17:07.474 --> 17:09.010
Might have seen her around
the club a few times.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.410
That's interesting,

17:10.444 --> 17:12.079
because it looked to me...

17:12.112 --> 17:13.380
like you knew her pretty well

17:13.414 --> 17:15.550
from the way that she was
grinding on you

17:15.582 --> 17:17.821
in the club, on the night that she died.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.689
We were just having a bit of fun.

17:19.723 --> 17:22.017
"A bit of fun?" Really?

17:22.049 --> 17:23.217
Is that what you call "fun?"

17:23.251 --> 17:25.220
Don't look away, Luc.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.320
That's what you did to Molly, isn't it?

17:27.355 --> 17:29.290
You were up on that roof with Grace,

17:29.324 --> 17:30.725
and then when she fell asleep,

17:30.758 --> 17:32.961
you tip-toed down into Molly's room,

17:32.993 --> 17:34.628
and it wasn't the first time
you'd gone from bed to bed

17:34.662 --> 17:36.231
with these two girls,

17:36.263 --> 17:37.998
except this time, Molly said "no,"

17:38.031 --> 17:38.781
didn't she, Luc?

17:38.815 --> 17:40.417
And things got out of hand, didn't they?

17:40.450 --> 17:43.405
- Didn't they?
- No, they didn't.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.231
Because I never left the roof.

17:46.308 --> 17:47.343
I'm sorry, sir,
you won't be able to view

17:47.377 --> 17:49.313
your sister's body until tomorrow.

17:49.345 --> 17:51.280
I'm not waiting until tomorrow.
I want to see her tonight.

17:51.313 --> 17:52.349
- Sir, I was told...
- I don't give a damn

17:52.381 --> 17:53.616
what you were told!

17:54.820 --> 17:57.517
Molly's alone on a cold slab back there.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.537
I need to be with my sister.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.767
I'll see what I can do.
Please take a seat.

18:02.792 --> 18:04.576
Just for a minute, while I check.

18:20.494 --> 18:22.730
I'm so sorry about your sister.

18:22.763 --> 18:23.979
Did you know Molly?

18:26.289 --> 18:27.130
No.

18:29.857 --> 18:31.408
Then what do you know about it?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.612
I know it doesn't help.

18:35.644 --> 18:37.325
Seeing them after.

18:39.481 --> 18:40.883
It doesn't make you feel any better.

18:44.966 --> 18:46.873
I don't want to feel better.

18:57.084 --> 18:58.418
Can't talk right now, James.

18:58.451 --> 18:59.773
Grace is in custody.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.946
She was caught trying to leave
the country.

19:00.971 --> 19:02.527
Why didn't you call me?

19:03.189 --> 19:04.658
We had to find local counsel

19:04.692 --> 19:06.064
- right away.
- I'm already on it.

19:06.097 --> 19:07.061
Friend from Harvard

19:07.093 --> 19:08.361
recommended a top criminal
defense attorney.

19:08.395 --> 19:09.931
No, no, no, I've got a guy

19:09.964 --> 19:11.264
- who can handle it.
- A guy?

19:11.298 --> 19:13.124
Grace is a suspect in a brutal homicide.

19:13.157 --> 19:15.801
- She needs the best.
- And you think I'd hire

19:15.826 --> 19:17.432
less than the best for my daughter?

19:18.424 --> 19:19.826
Stepdaughter.

19:19.858 --> 19:22.328
Yeah, well,

19:22.360 --> 19:24.607
Grace is in great hands
with Stan Gutterie.

19:24.641 --> 19:27.033
Come on now.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.782
There you go, buddy.

19:28.847 --> 19:30.517
I know you want it.

19:30.549 --> 19:32.351
I know you want it.

19:32.384 --> 19:34.387
Come on. That's it.

19:34.421 --> 19:36.623
Oh, hey, look who's here.

19:36.655 --> 19:39.158
We have a contestant.

19:39.191 --> 19:40.493
Come on, don't bite me.

19:42.394 --> 19:44.131
That's it.

19:44.163 --> 19:45.965
Oh, yes...!

19:45.998 --> 19:48.168
You see that much action?

19:49.835 --> 19:51.704
Seriously?

19:53.508 --> 19:55.075
Yes!

19:57.209 --> 19:59.345
What's that?

19:59.379 --> 20:01.582
One second.

20:02.031 --> 20:03.006
Hey.

20:03.039 --> 20:04.420
All right.

20:04.452 --> 20:06.537
- Let's do this.
- Excuse me?

20:06.569 --> 20:08.204
I'm sorry, as loud
as you guys are being,

20:08.238 --> 20:09.974
I thought it was an invitation
to join in.

20:10.007 --> 20:12.442
No? Oh, geez, I'm so sorry.

20:12.476 --> 20:14.797
In that case, do me a favor,
keep it down, all right?

20:14.822 --> 20:16.233
You're scaring off the wildlife.

20:16.267 --> 20:19.464
I'm entitled to have sex in my
own home, as loud as I want.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.079
Well, why don't I call your husband

20:21.112 --> 20:23.347
and see what he thinks
about your right to loud sex.

20:23.381 --> 20:25.417
Three weeks a month, I don't hear a peep

20:25.449 --> 20:26.884
coming out of this place, not a whimper.

20:26.918 --> 20:28.020
Then your husband,

20:28.053 --> 20:30.054
he takes his monthly trip to Tokyo

20:30.087 --> 20:31.856
and you suddenly get your sushi on,

20:31.890 --> 20:33.123
so do me a favor and keep it down,

20:33.155 --> 20:35.928
or I'm gonna be forced to call Japan.

20:37.852 --> 20:39.889
Gutterie.

20:39.921 --> 20:41.089
I'm on it.

20:41.122 --> 20:42.924
I'm telling you,
Molly and I didn't fight.

20:42.957 --> 20:45.160
We were friends. Good friends.

20:45.194 --> 20:46.729
Such good friends,

20:46.762 --> 20:48.264
that the day after
you find her murdered,

20:48.296 --> 20:49.899
you run off to Paris

20:49.931 --> 20:51.577
- with your boyfriend.
- Come on, Grace.

20:51.611 --> 20:52.467
We've all got flatmates.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.537
There's always something to fight about.

20:55.896 --> 20:57.364
I guess sometimes we got into it

20:57.397 --> 20:59.200
over stupid stuff,
but nothing important,

20:59.233 --> 21:01.068
nothing worth...

21:01.102 --> 21:02.104
What about boys?

21:03.676 --> 21:05.879
- Boys?
- Yeah, you know, boys.

21:05.913 --> 21:06.947
You ever like the same one?

21:07.818 --> 21:09.150
I had this friend.

21:09.183 --> 21:10.484
We were like sisters.

21:10.516 --> 21:12.061
Then we met Billy Shaw.

21:12.094 --> 21:14.321
We both wanted him, and that's when

21:14.353 --> 21:15.479
things turned ugly.

21:15.512 --> 21:18.069
And so you killed her. Right?

21:18.315 --> 21:20.117
Please. Grace, come on, let's go.

21:21.924 --> 21:22.726
Come on.

21:26.105 --> 21:27.508
Well, this is over.

21:42.967 --> 21:45.203
- Stan Gutterie?
- You must be the sister.

21:45.236 --> 21:47.839
Come on in.

21:47.872 --> 21:49.440
Good timing.

21:49.472 --> 21:52.009
Can't really babysit Grace all day.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.522
Oh, but it was okay for me
to sit around Scotland Yard

21:54.556 --> 21:56.647
not knowing you snuck Grace
out the back door?

21:56.672 --> 21:58.849
Like I'd risk her saying
something stupid to you

21:58.883 --> 22:00.151
in front of the cops.

22:02.052 --> 22:03.153
Where is she?

22:03.186 --> 22:04.821
She's zonked out.

22:04.853 --> 22:05.989
I gave her a Xanax.

22:07.689 --> 22:09.025
What?

22:19.057 --> 22:21.440
You're a lawyer, not her doctor.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.037
I am whatever she needs me to be
to keep her ass out of jail.

22:24.265 --> 22:25.633
This isn't gonna work.

22:25.658 --> 22:27.879
You know what I did when
I was waiting around for you?

22:27.904 --> 22:29.338
I found out why you're

22:29.370 --> 22:31.060
not practicing law in the U.S. anymore.

22:40.139 --> 22:41.250
So?

22:41.283 --> 22:42.299
So...

22:43.080 --> 22:45.788
I'm not going to let
the idiot who took a leak

22:45.800 --> 22:47.213
on a judge's dinner represent my sister.

22:48.052 --> 22:50.076
That was a white
truffle risotto, actually.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.503
You proud of that?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.032
I am not not proud.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.740
Look, you're a good prosecutor, right?

22:55.773 --> 22:57.389
You put the bad guys away.

22:57.414 --> 22:58.886
Makes you feel real good about yourself.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.793
Let me ask you just one
question, there, counselor:

23:00.819 --> 23:01.821
what are you gonna do if you find out

23:01.853 --> 23:03.788
that your sister, there, is the bad guy?

23:03.822 --> 23:06.225
You gonna have the stones to do
what it takes to get her off?

23:06.257 --> 23:07.492
Grace didn't do this.

23:07.973 --> 23:09.980
Do you know what her alibi is?

23:10.696 --> 23:12.968
She was banging some French
douchebag up on the roof,

23:12.993 --> 23:14.321
while her friend was being murdered.

23:14.823 --> 23:17.627
She was so coked out of her head
she didn't remember

23:17.659 --> 23:19.620
walking through a dead girl's
blood to go tinkle.

23:19.705 --> 23:21.573
I know my sister is innocent.

23:21.607 --> 23:23.809
Yeah, well, too bad
you're not on her jury.

23:23.841 --> 23:25.844
Now, look, if you want to add any value

23:25.878 --> 23:27.746
to this brouhaha, I suggest

23:27.780 --> 23:29.447
you tell your idiot sister, there,

23:29.481 --> 23:31.463
to keep her pie hole shut
while I go spin this

23:31.495 --> 23:34.128
"fleeing the country" BS into gold.

23:49.666 --> 23:52.235
I should've been there to protect you.

23:54.705 --> 23:55.934
I should've...

23:58.241 --> 24:00.110
I'm gonna find the bastard

24:00.143 --> 24:01.711
who did this to you, Molly.

24:01.745 --> 24:03.548
And when I do,

24:03.581 --> 24:05.984
I'm gonna bring his head back
home to Ireland on a stake.

24:29.797 --> 24:31.967
I know you want someone to pay

24:32.000 --> 24:33.567
for what happened to your sister, but...

24:33.600 --> 24:35.875
doing something that gets you
thrown in jail

24:35.900 --> 24:37.073
won't help Molly.

24:37.113 --> 24:38.882
You have to trust the system.

24:38.916 --> 24:41.026
To get justice for
a Northern Irish girl?

24:41.402 --> 24:43.404
No offense, lady, but my people
have been gettin' bent over

24:43.438 --> 24:45.440
by your system for centuries.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.488
Maybe you don't trust the system.

24:49.252 --> 24:52.224
But I promise you, you can trust me.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.159
Tell the DA he does not need
to reassign the case.

24:58.191 --> 25:00.747
Just-just give me a few more
days to clear this up.

25:04.163 --> 25:05.199
I gotta go.

25:10.269 --> 25:11.838
Nat...

25:11.872 --> 25:13.173
you're here.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.542
Thank God.

25:19.588 --> 25:20.623
Are you okay?

25:27.044 --> 25:28.893
I can't believe all this.

25:28.925 --> 25:31.949
First Molly, and now the police
are acting like I killed her

25:31.983 --> 25:34.119
- and they were asking me...
- Grace...

25:34.151 --> 25:35.653
we'll get it straightened out.

25:35.686 --> 25:36.828
I promise.

25:40.352 --> 25:42.669
The next time you flee the country,

25:42.837 --> 25:44.473
can you call me first?

25:44.571 --> 25:45.850
I'm sorry.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.765
I shouldn't have let
Luc talk me into it,

25:48.797 --> 25:49.843
but I was...

25:50.483 --> 25:52.051
I was just really freaked out.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.170
I mean, how well do you
really know this guy?

25:55.203 --> 25:56.393
Enough to know he wouldn't hurt Molly.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.479
Okay. I'm sorry.

26:03.288 --> 26:05.052
Come on.

26:05.086 --> 26:06.115
Let's get out of here.

26:06.140 --> 26:07.404
James booked us a hotel room.

26:08.032 --> 26:09.647
Want to go run up his room service bill?

26:09.672 --> 26:10.629
Yeah.

26:11.401 --> 26:12.870
Do you think they have mac and cheese?

26:12.904 --> 26:14.472
Yeah, they better.

26:19.074 --> 26:21.444
Grace Atwood is a young girl,

26:21.477 --> 26:24.880
far from home, who woke
to find her best friend

26:24.913 --> 26:26.349
savagely murdered.

26:26.382 --> 26:28.251
Yes, Grace got on a train to Paris.

26:28.284 --> 26:31.955
Not because she is guilty
of this heinous crime,

26:31.987 --> 26:34.654
because she feared for her life.

26:34.686 --> 26:36.861
She had every reason to be scared,

26:36.893 --> 26:39.567
because there's a madman
loose in London.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.102
What Scotland Yard needs to do

26:41.134 --> 26:43.170
is stop wasting time harassing

26:43.204 --> 26:45.974
an innocent, terrified young girl,

26:46.006 --> 26:48.097
and start trying to find
the sadistic butcher

26:48.575 --> 26:49.910
who killed Molly Ryan.

26:52.746 --> 26:54.515
I had the most god-awful dinner tonight.

26:54.548 --> 26:55.330
Squab.

26:56.255 --> 26:57.525
Do you know what that is?

26:58.409 --> 26:59.390
Pigeon.

26:59.423 --> 27:01.026
Mm.

27:01.058 --> 27:03.362
I imagine that, once upon a time,

27:03.394 --> 27:05.964
some down-on-its-luck manor
was hosting a swanky guest

27:05.998 --> 27:07.566
and couldn't afford
a decent cut of meat,

27:07.598 --> 27:09.634
so they... they caught a few pigeons,

27:09.668 --> 27:13.473
roasted them and
they called that "squab."

27:13.854 --> 27:15.355
And the guest,

27:15.389 --> 27:18.359
thinking he ought to know
what he was eating,

27:18.391 --> 27:19.388
didn't ask.

27:20.360 --> 27:23.732
I, for better or for worse,

27:23.764 --> 27:26.020
know what squab is.

27:27.534 --> 27:30.504
But you're not here to listen to
what I had for dinner tonight,

27:30.537 --> 27:31.275
are you?

27:32.305 --> 27:34.517
No, that's not why you're here at all.

27:36.077 --> 27:37.912
I don't want to see that one again.

27:37.945 --> 27:39.714
Anything specific

27:39.746 --> 27:41.115
that was not to your liking, sir?

27:45.239 --> 27:46.499
She wasn't Molly.

27:50.173 --> 27:52.309
This is Buckingham Dispatch

27:52.334 --> 27:54.003
to Gate One... open, please.

27:59.399 --> 28:01.267
Prince Theo is entering the palace.

28:43.772 --> 28:45.974
You know, you can... you can stay here

28:46.008 --> 28:47.085
as long as you like.

28:47.118 --> 28:48.945
- Yeah?
- Of course.

28:49.534 --> 28:53.016
I might be able to do...
something for you, too.

28:53.781 --> 28:54.788
There's this job I know about.

28:54.820 --> 28:55.855
Mm-hmm?

28:56.246 --> 28:58.048
Can make stupid money.

28:58.081 --> 28:59.154
Stupid money?

28:59.188 --> 29:00.218
If you're into that.

29:00.243 --> 29:00.965
Yeah.

29:00.998 --> 29:02.419
I could be into that.

29:07.257 --> 29:08.881
Luc. Thank God.

29:08.915 --> 29:09.797
Are you okay?

29:17.222 --> 29:19.125
Why did you get released before me?

29:19.157 --> 29:20.760
I don't know. My lawyer got me out.

29:20.792 --> 29:21.741
Since when do you have a lawyer?

29:21.766 --> 29:23.389
Since my stepdad hired him.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.239
They were awful to me, Luc. The cops.

29:26.271 --> 29:27.098
You?

29:27.652 --> 29:29.721
They held me in that room for 20 hours.

29:29.753 --> 29:31.520
What did you tell them?

29:32.123 --> 29:34.125
That we were together
on the roof all night.

29:34.157 --> 29:35.726
- What else would I tell them?
- They took my passport.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.828
You must have told them something.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.996
Yeah, they took my passport, too.

29:39.030 --> 29:40.084
Look...

29:40.664 --> 29:41.853
it'll be okay.

29:41.887 --> 29:44.117
I'm sure my lawyer can help both of us.

29:44.769 --> 29:46.770
That's not how it works, Grace.

29:46.803 --> 29:48.639
They're looking for someone
to pin this on

29:48.673 --> 29:49.886
and I'm the one who's going to hang.

29:51.194 --> 29:52.531
Luc!

29:57.103 --> 29:59.139
- I'm sorry, but...
- Spray the pillow with luminol.

29:59.171 --> 30:00.406
Frisk it, do whatever
you need to make sure

30:00.440 --> 30:01.775
that it's not evidence.

30:01.807 --> 30:03.632
What is this about frisking a pillow?

30:04.251 --> 30:05.443
Well... it's been four days

30:05.468 --> 30:06.660
since the murder, Detective,

30:06.685 --> 30:08.151
and I don't think that it's unreasonable

30:08.176 --> 30:09.355
to ask for a few personal items.

30:10.195 --> 30:11.536
Back in Boston,

30:11.568 --> 30:13.157
we would've processed this scene
within 48 hours.

30:13.356 --> 30:15.158
Oh, back in Boston.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.293
Where you're an Assistant
District Attorney, aren't you?

30:17.691 --> 30:19.362
I'm slow to clear a crime scene,

30:19.395 --> 30:20.410
but I do know how to use Google.

30:20.435 --> 30:22.198
My sister wakes up screaming

30:22.232 --> 30:24.394
and she can't get back to sleep.

30:24.419 --> 30:27.199
And I just thought, maybe,
if she had her own pillow...

30:27.902 --> 30:29.384
I know that sounds silly.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.331
No, it doesn't, actually.

30:33.508 --> 30:35.211
Go frisk Miss Atwood's pillow, will you?

30:37.779 --> 30:38.419
Thank you.

30:39.936 --> 30:42.406
Grace's room has been cleared
for two days.

30:44.408 --> 30:46.596
Uh, has this coat rack been cleared?

30:47.065 --> 30:49.701
'Cause that's Grace's jacket
and it's pretty chilly out.

30:50.319 --> 30:51.785
Bold.

30:52.027 --> 30:53.462
Suppose I should admire that, really.

30:58.791 --> 31:00.086
Hey, there. Whoa.

31:00.118 --> 31:01.426
What are you doing?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.461
I'm so sorry.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.064
Um, this is Grace's, too.

31:05.096 --> 31:06.865
Is it okay if I take it?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.801
Shall I just call in
a moving truck for you?

31:11.857 --> 31:14.494
Meanwhile, Scotland
Yard has remained tight-lipped

31:14.526 --> 31:17.330
regarding the murder
investigation of Molly Ryan.

31:17.362 --> 31:18.730
The 22-year-old student

31:18.763 --> 31:20.299
from Northern Ireland

31:20.331 --> 31:22.234
was found murdered early Friday morning

31:22.267 --> 31:24.277
by her flatmates
in her East Peckham loft.

31:24.822 --> 31:27.359
Sources tell CCB
that Ryan was discovered

31:27.384 --> 31:29.520
in a pool of her own blood,
and that a large...

31:30.109 --> 31:32.054
Hi.

31:32.118 --> 31:33.587
I got your pillow.

31:34.213 --> 31:36.063
You can finally change your clothes.

31:36.088 --> 31:37.196
You're the best.

31:39.651 --> 31:41.935
Hey, um, did James give you this?

31:45.750 --> 31:46.844
No.

31:48.249 --> 31:50.652
It was Molly's.

31:55.066 --> 31:58.002
What was Grace's

31:58.036 --> 32:00.138
dead roommate doing with the
scarf I gave you last Christmas?

32:00.171 --> 32:01.429
What are you talking about?

32:01.454 --> 32:03.395
What's an Irish girl doing

32:03.420 --> 32:05.494
with a scarf from a Boston men's shop?

32:05.519 --> 32:07.456
I don't like what you're insinuating.

32:07.481 --> 32:09.390
You couldn't keep your hands
off pretty young girls

32:09.415 --> 32:11.517
even when my mom was alive.

32:11.542 --> 32:13.643
If you had anything
to do with Molly Ryan...

32:13.695 --> 32:15.063
Natalie, come on, you know I've been

32:15.095 --> 32:16.395
in Amsterdam all week.

32:16.429 --> 32:19.368
No, I know you said you've
been in Amsterdam all week.

32:19.401 --> 32:20.768
Natalie...

32:28.826 --> 32:29.860
We've been back over it 20 times.

32:29.893 --> 32:31.534
There's nothing else to see.

32:37.767 --> 32:39.803
Mate, do you remember
bagging up a stuffed monkey

32:39.836 --> 32:41.237
from Molly's room?

32:41.270 --> 32:42.472
I don't see anything on here.

32:43.558 --> 32:46.295
Anyway, who gives a rat's ass
about a stuffed monkey?

32:46.595 --> 32:48.550
Whoever nicked it, that's who.

32:49.294 --> 32:51.085
All right, now Grace said

32:51.110 --> 32:53.201
that Molly thought
she was being watched;

32:53.226 --> 32:54.275
that someone was stealing her stuff.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.918
What if, what if she was right,

32:56.943 --> 32:59.278
and the stalker broke back in

32:59.303 --> 33:02.406
for one last memento.

33:02.431 --> 33:04.467
To a sealed crime scene?

33:06.267 --> 33:07.544
Whoever took that monkey

33:07.569 --> 33:09.002
didn't come in through
the front door, but

33:09.027 --> 33:10.708
maybe they came in through the window.

33:10.733 --> 33:12.369
Maybe they climbed down

33:12.675 --> 33:13.950
from up here.

33:13.975 --> 33:15.772
And the killer could've
done the same thing

33:15.797 --> 33:16.743
on the night of the murder.

33:16.768 --> 33:19.164
Grace and Luc are down there wasted.

33:19.189 --> 33:21.626
Our killer could've just
slipped right by them.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.616
So how did he get up here
in the first place?

33:27.276 --> 33:28.912
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bruno.

33:28.946 --> 33:30.247
Calm down.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.182
Let's not go jumping off any buildings.

33:33.813 --> 33:36.762
That building's no more
than seven feet away.

33:37.003 --> 33:39.139
Someone could've made that jump,
if they were motivated.

33:39.164 --> 33:40.900
Listen, odds are the killer
was down there in the party.

33:40.925 --> 33:43.694
You want to play the odds
and collect your pension?

33:43.719 --> 33:45.521
That's fine, but I'm gonna chase down

33:45.546 --> 33:47.983
every lead, no matter how inconvenient,

33:48.008 --> 33:50.512
until I know who killed Molly Ryan.

34:14.033 --> 34:15.534
Grace! Grace!

34:15.569 --> 34:16.837
Grace, were you sleeping
with your professor?

34:16.870 --> 34:18.272
Did you slash his wife's tires?

34:18.304 --> 34:19.940
Grace...

34:19.973 --> 34:21.241
did you kill Molly?

34:22.141 --> 34:23.243
Did you kill Molly?

34:24.371 --> 34:26.407
- Were you jealous of Molly?
- Grace, were you... -No!

34:26.438 --> 34:28.775
No!

34:29.842 --> 34:31.579
No!

34:31.612 --> 34:33.081
- Stop!
- Leave her alone!

34:33.112 --> 34:35.550
Leave her alone! Please!

34:35.583 --> 34:37.318
Stop it! Get back!

34:37.351 --> 34:39.887
Get out of the way!
All of you, get back!

34:39.920 --> 34:42.824
Back up! Come on! Get inside... come on!

34:42.856 --> 34:43.925
Get those doors open!

34:43.958 --> 34:45.193
Let us in!

34:45.226 --> 34:47.494
Don't let any of them through!

34:47.527 --> 34:50.264
Why... why'd they do that?

34:50.295 --> 34:51.898
Why?

34:51.931 --> 34:54.068
Because someone out there

34:54.101 --> 34:56.070
decided that your pretty face

34:56.103 --> 34:58.005
could sell papers. They dug into you,

34:58.037 --> 35:00.400
and... they found this.

35:00.635 --> 35:02.604
It wouldn't be
the first time that American

35:02.637 --> 35:05.307
Grace Atwood lashed out at a rival

35:05.340 --> 35:06.608
for Professor Linley's affections.

35:06.641 --> 35:09.011
CCTV footage captured Miss Atwood

35:09.045 --> 35:11.847
slashing the tires of his wife's car.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.548
Just hours later, Mrs. Linley's car spun

35:13.581 --> 35:17.052
out of control,
and she was gravely injured.

35:17.086 --> 35:18.178
Now, I want to help you.

35:18.693 --> 35:20.062
But every time I turn around,
I'm getting

35:20.095 --> 35:21.430
blindsided... I need answers.

35:21.463 --> 35:24.566
I didn't try to kill his wife!

35:24.599 --> 35:26.068
- He was an ass...
- Grace.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.070
Go upstairs.

35:28.102 --> 35:29.338
Don't touch your phone.

35:29.370 --> 35:30.972
Don't touch your laptop.

35:31.006 --> 35:32.641
Just wait for me. I'll be right up.

35:36.988 --> 35:38.791
You know she can't talk to you
without her attorney.

35:38.823 --> 35:41.126
I thought we covered this,
'cause you're an attorney.

35:42.142 --> 35:44.997
An attorney who's not licensed
to practice in the UK.

35:45.030 --> 35:46.499
You're bleeding.

35:48.105 --> 35:48.800
Uh...

35:48.834 --> 35:51.150
You must've gotten clipped by a camera.

35:52.183 --> 35:55.320
So, Stan Gutterie.

35:57.543 --> 35:58.566
He's not cheap.

35:59.184 --> 36:01.387
You hire him,

36:01.412 --> 36:03.413
people start wondering
what you've got to hide.

36:05.432 --> 36:06.717
Our stepdad's an ass.

36:06.818 --> 36:08.387
He hired an ass.

36:08.415 --> 36:09.918
That's all that means.

36:10.950 --> 36:13.520
I know a thing or two
about jackass stepdads.

36:13.553 --> 36:15.956
Not that my real dad was any prize.

36:17.327 --> 36:19.630
Our real dad was amazing.

36:21.428 --> 36:22.849
But he died

36:24.081 --> 36:25.337
when I was in high school.

36:29.233 --> 36:31.970
So James is what we're stuck with.

36:33.465 --> 36:34.967
Natalie, if Grace has an explanation,

36:34.992 --> 36:36.747
she needs to tell me now.

36:37.967 --> 36:40.396
She's not talking without her attorney.

36:43.757 --> 36:46.793
Well... thank you,

36:46.974 --> 36:49.010
but I think I've got this from here.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.521
Is it true?

36:59.553 --> 37:01.261
Did you sleep with your professor?

37:01.482 --> 37:03.185
- Did you hurt his wife?
- No!

37:03.210 --> 37:05.279
Not the way they're making it sound.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.528
I had a thing with Geoffrey...

37:07.561 --> 37:08.928
Professor Linley.

37:08.953 --> 37:09.468
"A thing"?

37:09.493 --> 37:11.075
We had sex, Nat; a few times.

37:11.095 --> 37:12.863
You're sleeping with married
men, you're snorting blow...

37:12.897 --> 37:14.131
- This is not who you are!
- I didn't know he was married.

37:14.163 --> 37:15.700
When I found out, I was pissed!

37:15.732 --> 37:18.001
That's why I slashed his tires!

37:22.218 --> 37:23.688
Do you realize how psycho that looks?

37:23.713 --> 37:24.715
I was wasted.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.204
I wasn't thinking.

37:29.112 --> 37:30.114
What about Molly?

37:34.916 --> 37:36.418
What about her?

37:41.770 --> 37:44.274
I'm only gonna ask you this once, Grace.

37:46.925 --> 37:48.433
Did you kill Molly?

37:50.822 --> 37:52.020
No.

37:55.712 --> 37:57.567
How can you ask me that?

37:57.987 --> 37:59.486
You're my sister.

38:00.866 --> 38:03.034
Do you really think I could do that?

38:05.924 --> 38:07.883
I'm so sorry, Grace.

38:10.012 --> 38:11.916
I know you wouldn't hurt Molly.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.859
Where the hell have you been?

38:28.016 --> 38:30.600
Did you miss me? See, I knew

38:30.633 --> 38:32.371
- we had something special.
- Oh, yeah.

38:32.639 --> 38:34.039
Best thing that ever happened to me

38:34.072 --> 38:35.608
was my sister becoming a murder suspect

38:35.642 --> 38:37.043
and bringing you into my life.

38:37.075 --> 38:39.311
Do I detect a bit of sarcasm?

38:39.345 --> 38:42.582
Maybe because the press
is tearing Grace apart,

38:42.615 --> 38:44.584
and you're up here having happy hour.

38:44.617 --> 38:46.052
Oh, Natalie.

38:46.084 --> 38:48.387
You see somebody taking
a dump in your Chardonnay.

38:48.421 --> 38:51.412
Me... I see someone handing me
a 20-year-old single malt.

38:52.425 --> 38:55.665
The tabloids have just handed us
an alternative suspect.

38:55.711 --> 38:58.325
- You think Linley killed Molly?
- I don't know.

38:58.358 --> 39:00.161
It's gonna be kind of fun
making it look like he did.

39:00.195 --> 39:01.756
Okay, have your fun.

39:03.193 --> 39:04.962
All I care about is my sister.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.595
And getting her home.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.937
She's not going anyplace anytime soon.

39:11.413 --> 39:12.582
Then neither am I.

39:13.758 --> 39:15.594
Grace is innocent.

39:16.161 --> 39:17.929
I'm not leaving London
until I prove that.

39:17.963 --> 39:19.565
You want to help Grace?

39:19.597 --> 39:22.168
You better stop worrying
about whether she's innocent...

39:23.830 --> 39:26.566
...and start worrying about
who else looks guilty.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.568
Luckily, with a case this dirty,

39:28.600 --> 39:30.169
there's plenty of guilt to go around.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.747
All right.

39:41.781 --> 39:43.450
There we go.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.285
You look beautiful.

39:47.133 --> 39:48.621
I think you're ready.

39:48.655 --> 39:50.055
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

40:48.715 --> 40:50.418
Where's your Irish friend?

40:50.451 --> 40:51.586
She...

40:51.619 --> 40:54.122
won't be coming back.
