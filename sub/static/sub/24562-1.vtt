Sue...

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:14.213
you're not half the man Tommy
thought that you were, huh?

01:29:14.215 --> 01:29:15.582

Look at that, man.

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:20.885
You should've walked away.

01:29:20.887 --> 01:29:23.788
Had to settle
for a knockout.

01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:25.324

Your boys, man.
They set it off.

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:42.808
It was a bloodbath.
I tried to stop 'em.

01:29:42.810 --> 01:29:45.310
It's why I called you.

01:29:45.312 --> 01:29:47.579
- My boys did this?
- Yeah.

01:29:47.581 --> 01:29:49.483
Well, like Sue
always said...

01:29:49.485 --> 01:29:51.984
there will always be
a bigger, badder cat

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:54.153
just waiting to take
you down.

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:56.389

Tommy...

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.823

01:29:58.825 --> 01:30:01.092
Ah, you piece of shit.

01:30:01.094 --> 01:30:03.997
You think I don't know
you set us up?

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:05.998
Did you really think
you can kill a man

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.800
like Sulinski
"Golden Boy" Baker

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.836
and just walk away?

01:30:35.195 --> 01:30:37.697
Get SWAT on the radio.
You two, on my six.

01:30:37.699 --> 01:30:42.103
I need SWAT over here
on 5610 Eastside. Over and out.

Let me cut it up
for you now, okay?

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:51.770
Don't need you choking
after all that.

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:54.206
Make sure you have
some of your spinach with it.

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.311
It tastes delicious.
All right?

01:31:57.611 --> 01:31:59.177
Do cows have a good life

01:31:59.179 --> 01:32:01.881

turned into steak, Daddy?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course, they do, sweetheart.

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.287
Yeah, cows get to do
all the fun things

01:32:08.289 --> 01:32:11.591
that cows love doing.
You know? Like, um...

01:32:11.593 --> 01:32:14.025
Like eating daisies and, uh,

01:32:14.027 --> 01:32:16.628
roll around in the grass.
Just like you.

01:32:16.630 --> 01:32:19.366
Then, you know,
the farmer does come along.

01:32:19.368 --> 01:32:22.635
He looks the cow in the eye,
and he says:

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:24.369
"Barbecue time!"
