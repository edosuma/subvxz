ANNOUNCER:
In second place, Wax Madonnas.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.922

<i>They're not ever gonna win</i>

00:10.922 --> 00:13.093
ABBY LEE: <i>The minis are official</i>

TIFFANIE: <i>Peyton was</i>
<i>in the corner, going,</i>

00:14.596 --> 00:15.999
"Mommy, just stop."
KERRI:
No, she didn't.

00:15.999 --> 00:17.936
Peyton was on my lap,
dumb (bleep).

00:17.936 --> 00:19.873
I'm not engaging with this.

00:19.873 --> 00:22.646
This is not the people
I want to even be inspired by.

00:22.646 --> 00:24.382
I want them all to be stars.

00:24.382 --> 00:25.885
<i>It's all about new beginnings.</i>

00:25.885 --> 00:27.656
Your business is thriving.

00:27.656 --> 00:29.993
Our children are not,
right now.

00:29.993 --> 00:31.864
Oh, you are a class act.

00:31.864 --> 00:33.233
KIRA:
<i>"New beginnings"?</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:36.239
Well, that lasted a week.

ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

00:42.451 --> 00:44.388
<i>Girls, you are doing a piece</i>

<i>in the dance studio</i>
<i>using a walker.</i>

00:55.377 --> 00:58.450
Nope, this is not happening.
This is not happening. Get out.

00:58.450 --> 01:01.590
Get out!
My daughter is the best one
on this team.

01:01.590 --> 01:03.326
You need to back the (bleep) up
out of my face, bitch.

01:03.326 --> 01:04.830
Stop! We're a team!

Whoa!

JILL:
<i>Hi there.</i>

01:20.862 --> 01:22.197
Hello.
Welcome back.

01:22.197 --> 01:25.003
How's everybody?
Nice to see you.

01:25.003 --> 01:26.005
Doing well. Likewise,
you look beautiful...

01:26.005 --> 01:27.041
Nice to see you.
...as always.

01:27.041 --> 01:27.976
Oh, well thank you.
That's nice.

01:27.976 --> 01:28.978
Hi.
Hi, Kerri.

01:28.978 --> 01:29.980
JILL:
<i>I'm never</i>

01:29.980 --> 01:31.449
excited when the minis are back.

01:31.449 --> 01:33.788
<i>Every time the minis are here,</i>

01:33.788 --> 01:36.059
I'm expecting Abby to be to be
too busy to work

01:36.059 --> 01:37.796
<i>with anybody, because...</i>

01:37.796 --> 01:40.067
she can't focus on one team,
let alone two.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.739
I'm Stacey. I'm the new one.
Stacey, I'm Jill.

01:42.739 --> 01:43.908
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

01:43.908 --> 01:46.079
My daughter is Lilli,
she's in there.

01:46.079 --> 01:47.916
JILL: <i>Oh, good. Oh, look how</i>
<i>cute they look in red.</i>

01:47.916 --> 01:50.020
<i>And on top of that,</i>

01:50.020 --> 01:51.890
<i>now there's a new mom</i>

01:51.890 --> 01:53.326
<i>and a new little girl.</i>

01:53.326 --> 01:55.932
<i>We're coming off of</i>
<i>two really great weeks.</i>

01:55.932 --> 01:58.804
<i>I really hope these minis</i>
<i>don't screw this up for us.</i>

01:58.804 --> 01:59.806
How's it been?

01:59.806 --> 02:01.476
You've been here
a couple weeks.

02:01.476 --> 02:04.750
JILL: We've been here‐‐ we just
finished up our second week.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.655
And Abby had
turned over a new leaf...
HOLLY: We had this thing

02:07.655 --> 02:08.858
with new beginnings.

02:08.858 --> 02:10.795
And definitely by Saturday,

02:10.795 --> 02:12.632
on competition day,
she imploded.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.834
Well 'cause Abby just left,

02:13.834 --> 02:15.137
and the kids were
about to go on stage.

02:15.137 --> 02:16.974
So, by default,

02:16.974 --> 02:18.944
Jess kind of was the new Abby.

02:18.944 --> 02:20.480
JESSALYNN:
Trios. We are dancers

02:20.480 --> 02:22.384
and dance moms,
and dance teachers,

02:22.384 --> 02:24.288
and that is why we're here.
We are dancing

02:24.288 --> 02:25.892
and we are
gonna look good.

02:25.892 --> 02:26.927
Let's go! Let's do it!

02:26.927 --> 02:28.229
HOLLY:
And you know what?

02:28.229 --> 02:29.599
That's the best thing you could
have done, because

02:29.599 --> 02:32.171
when Abby thinks
there is someone else

02:32.171 --> 02:33.574
that she can be
replaced with,

02:33.574 --> 02:35.511
she somehow figures out
how to get herself together.

02:35.511 --> 02:38.851
This week will truly be the test
of Abby's "new beginnings" era.

02:38.851 --> 02:41.523
<i>Can Abby juggle both</i>
<i>the elite competition team,</i>

02:41.523 --> 02:44.328
<i>and the mini competition team?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

02:44.328 --> 02:46.800
<i>Maybe last week's incident</i>
<i>was a minor setback,</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:49.238
and this is the week that Abby
whips herself into shape.

02:53.581 --> 02:55.317
JESSALYNN:
What the heck?

02:55.317 --> 02:57.655
JILL:
Oh, my God.

02:59.158 --> 03:01.195
JESSALYNN:
<i>What is going on here?</i>

03:01.195 --> 03:04.769
<i>Abby is walking in the dance</i>
<i>studio using a walker.</i>

03:04.769 --> 03:06.707
I mean, I don't even know.

03:08.343 --> 03:09.980
Let's go.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.819
Hi, Abby. I'm Stacey,
I'm Lilli's mom.
How are you?

03:12.819 --> 03:15.257
Nice to finally
meet you in person.
N i c e to meet you, too.

03:15.257 --> 03:17.461
KERRI:
How can we help you?

03:17.461 --> 03:20.701
Just keep your mouth shut
and be respectful,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.337
All right.
and let our kids dance.

03:22.337 --> 03:24.542
How is it going over there?

03:24.542 --> 03:27.080
How are you guys doing?
JILL:
What happened?

03:27.080 --> 03:28.617
I had a...

03:28.617 --> 03:30.186
treatment thing on my leg.

03:30.186 --> 03:32.592
Did you get actually,
like, cut open?

03:32.592 --> 03:33.594
Oh, yeah.
Do you have stitches?

03:33.594 --> 03:34.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Yes.

03:34.696 --> 03:36.767
As soon as they
had me up,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.236
they like, got me
out of bed

03:38.236 --> 03:40.340
and literally, it like,
burst open

03:40.340 --> 03:42.578
and it just‐‐
blood was splattered everywhere.

03:42.578 --> 03:44.616
They had to move me out of
the room to clean the whole‐‐

03:44.616 --> 03:46.920
to mop the whole room.
It was awful.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.327
Unfortunately, I had to
have knee surgery this week.

03:50.327 --> 03:52.030
I've put it off

03:52.030 --> 03:54.134
<i>for at least four years now.</i>

03:54.134 --> 03:56.573
And it's very painful.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.844
<i>But I also have</i>
<i>a lot of pain killers.</i>

03:58.844 --> 04:00.581
I think I'm gonna be fine.

04:00.581 --> 04:03.252
(chair creaking)

04:05.023 --> 04:07.562
(creaking continues)

04:23.894 --> 04:26.232
ABBY LEE:
<i>Come on, let's go! Pyramid!</i>

04:30.140 --> 04:31.442
Nia's sick, right?

04:31.442 --> 04:32.745
She's here.

04:32.745 --> 04:36.152
I heard through the grapevine
that she was ill, sick.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.287
Strep throat.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.228
Okay.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.003
Hello, sweetie.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.282
All right.

04:51.282 --> 04:54.021
The minis are back.

04:57.728 --> 04:58.897
I know last season was hard.

04:58.897 --> 05:00.801
We lost a few kids
along the way.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.872
But the strong kids survived.

05:02.872 --> 05:03.874
They're back. It's gonna be

05:03.874 --> 05:05.176
<i>a great season.</i>

05:05.176 --> 05:06.913
<i>They're going to learn.</i>
<i>They're going</i>

05:06.913 --> 05:08.617
to grow.
They're going to mature.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.788
And, hopefully,
they're going to win.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.090
We have a new mini member.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.194
Sweetheart, do you want
to introduce yourself?

05:14.194 --> 05:16.867
I'm‐‐ my name is Lilli
and I'm seven years old.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.604
And mom, you want
to introduce yourself?

05:18.604 --> 05:19.706
My name is Stacey,

05:19.706 --> 05:21.442
and I don't want
to say how old I am.

05:21.442 --> 05:23.112
That's fine.
(all laughing)

05:23.112 --> 05:24.649
And what do you do for a living?

05:24.649 --> 05:26.152
I'm a psychologist.

05:26.152 --> 05:30.561
So... this should be fun,
interesting. (laughs)

05:30.561 --> 05:31.663
<i>Lilli is known</i>

05:31.663 --> 05:33.934
for being little but fierce.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.372
<i>We came out to the ALDC because</i>

05:36.372 --> 05:38.209
we have both been
following the team

05:38.209 --> 05:39.579
since Lilli was

05:39.579 --> 05:42.618
<i>a baby.</i>
<i>Lilli has always wanted</i>

05:42.618 --> 05:44.121
<i>to work with Abby.</i>
<i>It's been something</i>

05:44.121 --> 05:46.492
she's been talking about since
she practically could talk.

05:46.492 --> 05:48.830
I want you to be on your
best behavior this week.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.402
And, nobody wants to see

05:51.402 --> 05:52.672
a child crying.

05:52.672 --> 05:54.576
Nobody wants to see a brat.

05:54.576 --> 05:56.713
Nobody wants to see
any of that.

05:56.713 --> 05:57.949
Does anybody want
to see a teacher

05:57.949 --> 05:59.484
sitting in the audience
and eat popcorn

05:59.484 --> 06:00.888
while their kids
are on stage?

06:00.888 --> 06:02.324
This is so good.

06:03.894 --> 06:06.332
It's better than movie theater;
it's so good.

06:07.602 --> 06:09.471
HOLLY: Well, what happened
in the dressing room‐‐

06:09.471 --> 06:12.612
I think you owe everyone who was
in the dressing room an apology.

06:12.612 --> 06:14.782
You were degrading

06:14.782 --> 06:16.720
by flipping me off
in the dressing room.

06:16.720 --> 06:17.955
Unacceptable.

06:17.955 --> 06:18.890
ABBY LEE:
<i>Holly thinks</i>

06:18.890 --> 06:20.326
that I owe her

06:20.326 --> 06:23.232
<i>an apology because</i>

06:23.232 --> 06:25.436
<i>I flipped her off.</i>

06:25.436 --> 06:28.342
She just happened to be the
last one speaking at the time.

06:28.342 --> 06:31.181
So it looked like
it was directed towards her,

06:31.181 --> 06:33.252
but it was really to everybody
that was in the room.

06:33.252 --> 06:35.691
And I apologize,
it was heartfelt.

06:35.691 --> 06:36.726
Very embarrassing.

06:36.726 --> 06:38.496
I would never,
ever do that to a woman.

06:38.496 --> 06:40.033
I've never done that in my life.
I don't even do it

06:40.033 --> 06:41.803
when a car's driving by me.
I don't.

06:41.803 --> 06:43.272
HOLLY:
<i>I think she's embarrassed.</i>

06:43.272 --> 06:45.343
<i>I think that's</i>
<i>what she's sorry about.</i>

06:45.343 --> 06:46.613
But for Abby,

06:46.613 --> 06:48.316
<i>that's one step</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

06:48.316 --> 06:49.919
<i>I've known Abby for years.</i>

06:49.919 --> 06:51.656
And that woman never

06:51.656 --> 06:52.658
<i>says she's sorry.</i>

06:52.658 --> 06:54.127
<i>That's a good sign</i>

06:54.127 --> 06:56.231
<i>that maybe it's gonna be</i>
<i>a good week.</i>

06:56.231 --> 06:58.537
All right. Let's get
to the pyramid.

06:58.537 --> 07:00.574
I'm changing things up
a little bit.

07:00.574 --> 07:02.110
I'm gonna start at the top.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.814
The top of the pyramid...

07:03.814 --> 07:05.784
is Nia.
(cheering and applause)

07:06.820 --> 07:08.055
Nia,

07:08.055 --> 07:09.391
you did a trio,
you were first.

07:09.391 --> 07:10.661
Congratulations.

07:10.661 --> 07:11.963
<i>I thought it was great.</i>

07:11.963 --> 07:13.299
<i>I loved it.</i>

07:13.299 --> 07:14.702
Kalani.

07:15.403 --> 07:17.040
Kendall.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.209
And then,

07:18.209 --> 07:19.579
JoJo.

07:19.579 --> 07:22.384
The trio.
My angels.

07:22.384 --> 07:25.022
<i>I thought that you guys</i>
<i>looked amazing.</i>

07:25.022 --> 07:26.492
<i>It was great.</i>

07:26.492 --> 07:28.630
Okay, and then we have Brynn.

07:28.630 --> 07:30.066
Brynn, you didn't have a trio,

07:30.066 --> 07:31.836
or a duet, or a solo,
or anything this week.

07:31.836 --> 07:34.107
All right!

07:34.107 --> 07:35.744
Our minis are on

07:35.744 --> 07:39.384
Yay!
the pyramid for
the very first time.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.325
The first mini

07:43.325 --> 07:45.731
would be Areana.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.267
The last time

07:47.267 --> 07:48.970
the minis were here,
you did a solo

07:48.970 --> 07:51.074
called, "For My Brother."

07:51.074 --> 07:52.444
<i>You really commanded the stage.</i>

07:52.444 --> 07:54.549
<i>And I thought</i>
<i>that you were confident.</i>

07:56.251 --> 07:57.788
Next...

07:57.788 --> 08:00.594
we have Alexus
in the group dance.

08:00.594 --> 08:02.598
You're somebody that

08:02.598 --> 08:05.971
is smart and has

08:05.971 --> 08:08.209
<i>a great ability to comprehend</i>
<i>choreography quickly.</i>

08:08.209 --> 08:09.679
<i>You're a natural born leader,</i>

08:09.679 --> 08:11.315
<i>so the other kids</i>
<i>are following you.</i>

08:12.685 --> 08:13.987
And next,

08:13.987 --> 08:15.891
Oh!
Peyton.

08:18.663 --> 08:21.468
<i>You need to be sharper,</i>
<i>you need to be stronger.</i>

08:21.468 --> 08:23.072
Next.

08:23.072 --> 08:24.374
Elliana.

08:24.374 --> 08:25.978
You need to fit
into the group.

08:25.978 --> 08:29.451
<i>You need to work well</i>
<i>with others.</i>

08:29.451 --> 08:31.523
And lastly,

08:31.523 --> 08:33.560
our newest

08:33.560 --> 08:35.196
apprentice,

08:35.196 --> 08:36.465
Lilli.

08:36.465 --> 08:37.935
So, ladies,

08:37.935 --> 08:39.371
we're attending Sheer Talent

17:11.595 --> 17:13.899
and she gets
to portray Beyoncé...

17:13.899 --> 17:16.203
that's just like,
that's‐that's up there.

17:16.203 --> 17:18.074
I just wish
it wasn't this week.

17:18.074 --> 17:19.476
Nia's been feeling
under the weather recently.

17:19.476 --> 17:21.113
She has strep throat.

17:21.113 --> 17:22.650
<i>But she really wants</i>
<i>to do this dance.</i>

17:22.650 --> 17:24.153
<i>This is rough on Nia</i>
<i>for her health</i>

17:24.153 --> 17:27.192
not to be 100%
when she wants to give 110%,

17:27.192 --> 17:28.796
is actually heartbreaking.

17:28.796 --> 17:31.668
ABBY LEE:
Nia, you're way down low.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.572
Plié, dig your back foot.

17:33.572 --> 17:35.776
Get your back foot up
and go way down.

17:35.776 --> 17:38.147
No, no.
Not even close.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.385
HOLLY: <i>Last time Nia</i>
<i>and Kendall had a duet,</i>

17:40.385 --> 17:42.155
and she had to fill in
for Kalani,

17:42.155 --> 17:43.626
that was bad.

17:43.626 --> 17:47.499
♪ Hands in the... ♪

17:47.499 --> 17:49.036
Oh...
I let everyone down!

17:49.036 --> 17:50.205
You didn't let everyone down.

17:50.205 --> 17:52.109
Yes, I did.
Kendall is mad at me.

17:52.109 --> 17:55.516
I wanted the next time for
Kendall and Nia to have a duet

17:55.516 --> 17:57.152
whenever that was,
that was gonna be

17:57.152 --> 17:59.524
top of the game,
feeling great about it

17:59.524 --> 18:01.193
from the very beginning.

18:01.193 --> 18:04.333
This is Kendall and Nia's shot
at redeeming themselves.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.972
We cannot have a repeat
of the last duet

18:06.972 --> 18:08.374
<i>that they had.</i>

18:08.374 --> 18:10.011
<i>I just pray that Nia</i>
<i>starts to feel better soon.</i>

18:10.011 --> 18:11.480
<i>The last thing</i>

18:11.480 --> 18:12.583
that Kendall needs right now

18:12.583 --> 18:15.321
<i>is a repeat disaster duet.</i>

18:18.629 --> 18:20.700
Someone's gonna be
the pageant princess,

18:20.700 --> 18:22.837
gonna win the crown
actually in the routine.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.543
I'm gonna be like...

18:25.543 --> 18:26.945
Like...
Maybe, I mean‐‐

18:28.515 --> 18:29.651
Well, that depends.

18:29.651 --> 18:31.521
Are you a good sport
in real life

18:31.521 --> 18:32.957
<i>or do you get get mad</i>
<i>whenever you're wrong.</i>

18:32.957 --> 18:34.293
ELLIANA: <i>I don't get mad.</i>
<i>I just say,</i>

18:34.293 --> 18:36.798
"Well, I tried."
I just say I'm gonna
try harder next time.

18:36.798 --> 18:39.571
It teaches you
to be humble and happy

18:39.571 --> 18:40.873
for the other people
that do it.

18:40.873 --> 18:42.008
Okay.

18:42.008 --> 18:43.277
ELLIANA:
<i>I feel like</i>

18:43.277 --> 18:44.681
I would deserve the crown

18:44.681 --> 18:47.085
because the other day,

18:47.085 --> 18:48.655
I got food poisoning

18:48.655 --> 18:51.127
in my food, and I still

18:51.127 --> 18:53.832
<i>went to seven classes at ALDC.</i>

18:53.832 --> 18:55.235
<i>And I feel like</i>

18:55.235 --> 18:56.705
I'm a leader and...

18:56.705 --> 18:58.241
I'm not trying to brag,

18:58.241 --> 19:00.646
but I feel like
I'm a good dancer, too.

19:03.752 --> 19:06.190
GIANNA:
On the first eight counts,

19:06.190 --> 19:07.760
nobody's transitioning.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.098
We're just dancing right here
in our own little square.

19:10.098 --> 19:11.367
Okay, so

19:11.367 --> 19:13.806
rond de jambe, step.

19:13.806 --> 19:15.275
One, two, three.

19:15.275 --> 19:17.445
Five, six, step, touch.

19:17.445 --> 19:18.782
Okay, let's see what we have.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.303
ABBY LEE:
<i>The mini group routine</i>

19:29.303 --> 19:30.706
<i>is based on</i>

19:30.706 --> 19:33.344
an old beauty pageant,
and the girls are

19:33.344 --> 19:35.348
<i>all vying for the crown.</i>

19:35.348 --> 19:37.085
<i>I want their facial expressions</i>

19:37.085 --> 19:39.189
<i>and their acting abilities</i>

19:39.189 --> 19:41.728
<i>to enhance</i>
<i>the dance performance.</i>

19:41.728 --> 19:44.233
I want to see the girls
act like a winner.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.003
Who has the acting chops?

19:46.003 --> 19:48.140
<i>Whoever wins the crown</i>
<i>at the end of this week,</i>

19:48.140 --> 19:52.850
<i>might just be the girl I'm</i>
<i>looking for to lead this team.</i>

19:52.850 --> 19:55.121
TIFFANIE: <i>The way I'm kind of</i>
<i>looking at it is Abby did</i>

19:55.121 --> 19:58.194
mention, like, one girl
was getting a‐a crown.

19:58.194 --> 19:59.797
They're looking
for the next star

19:59.797 --> 20:01.902
that's going to be able
to lead the team.

20:01.902 --> 20:04.373
Who's going to be the
person that you cannot

20:04.373 --> 20:06.377
replace on that team?

20:06.377 --> 20:08.347
There's lots of dancers
that can, like, fit a role.

20:08.347 --> 20:11.253
But unless you have that
central person that, like,

20:11.253 --> 20:13.558
brings something that
not anyone else can bring,

20:13.558 --> 20:14.961
you'll never have it.

20:14.961 --> 20:17.967
Like, Maddie was
the center of the team.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.539
YOLANDA: Well, it's true, but I
think every single one of them

20:20.539 --> 20:21.808
are extremely strong.

20:21.808 --> 20:23.277
I think each child
should be able to have

20:23.277 --> 20:24.781
the ability to be a leader.

20:24.781 --> 20:26.216
I don't think
that it worked well.

20:26.216 --> 20:28.387
I don't think it was a positive
thing for all those years.

20:28.387 --> 20:29.857
STACEY:
What did the other girls
feel like?

20:29.857 --> 20:33.431
Always being the, uh,
like a background dancer,

20:33.431 --> 20:34.567
<i>kind of?</i>

20:34.567 --> 20:36.671
TIFFANIE: <i>Alexus would never be</i>
<i>backup dancer.</i>

20:36.671 --> 20:39.076
That's not in
her personality.

20:39.076 --> 20:40.546
SARI: <i>I think that</i>
<i>Tiffanie's very selfish,</i>

20:40.546 --> 20:42.683
<i>and she's very consumed</i>
<i>with only how Alexus</i>

20:42.683 --> 20:45.488
<i>is doing, not how the girls are</i>
<i>working together as a team.</i>

20:45.488 --> 20:47.994
She thinks her daughter's

20:47.994 --> 20:49.296
<i>the next Maddie.</i>

20:49.296 --> 20:51.868
<i>Tiffanie needs to realize</i>

20:51.868 --> 20:54.039
that Abby is going to be the one
who picks the crown, not her.

20:54.039 --> 20:56.043
TIFFANIE:
<i>I think she's kind of like,</i>

20:56.043 --> 20:57.880
you know, recognizing
Alexus as the leader.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.684
<i>She's the point,</i>
<i>she's the focus.</i>

20:59.684 --> 21:01.320
KERRI:
<i>I don't agree with that.</i>

21:01.320 --> 21:02.523
YOLANDA:
<i>She's not been the point.</i>

21:02.523 --> 21:03.825
She has.
You look at‐‐

21:03.825 --> 21:05.328
No, she's not the point.
You‐you even told me

21:05.328 --> 21:06.397
Alexus demands
your attention.

21:06.397 --> 21:07.566
I, and I was
giving her a compliment.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.735
And I couldn't even
look at my own kid.

21:08.735 --> 21:09.937
I was giving her
a compliment.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.508
KERRI: <i>She'll take compliments</i>
<i>and twist 'em.</i>

21:11.508 --> 21:13.745
<i>So I wouldn't give her</i>
<i>a compliment.</i>

21:13.745 --> 21:15.348
You could be
in a large line of 25 people

21:15.348 --> 21:16.818
and still stand out in the back.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.622
<i>My daughter stands out</i>
<i>regardless.</i>

21:18.622 --> 21:19.991
So, whatever.

21:19.991 --> 21:21.360
(chuckles)

21:21.360 --> 21:22.563
You're tripping, girl.
You're tripping.

21:22.563 --> 21:23.598
You're crazy.

21:23.598 --> 21:25.034
Abby loves my daughter.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.336
What is she talking about?
(scoffs)

21:26.336 --> 21:28.307
This conversation
is over,

21:28.307 --> 21:29.844
because you're delusional.

21:29.844 --> 21:31.313
Tiffanie's saying that
her daughter's the leader.

21:31.313 --> 21:32.482
Her daughter's in charge.

21:32.482 --> 21:34.286
<i>But Abby's made it</i>
<i>very clear that</i>

21:34.286 --> 21:36.891
<i>Ari's one of Abby's favorites</i>
<i>and my daughter is</i>

21:36.891 --> 21:39.396
<i>going to receive the crown‐‐</i>
<i>I'm confident in that.</i>

21:39.396 --> 21:41.601
GIANNA:
Let's keep reviewing, okay?

21:41.601 --> 21:42.903
We should never stop
thinking about this routine

21:42.903 --> 21:44.640
from now until Saturday.

21:44.640 --> 21:47.580
If you have any counts
about questions, ask Alexus.

21:47.580 --> 21:48.615
(scoffs)

21:48.615 --> 21:49.917
TIFFANIE:
<i>The fact that Gianna</i>

21:49.917 --> 21:52.556
was telling the other girls
to go to Alexus

21:52.556 --> 21:54.459
<i>if they had any questions,</i>
<i>just proves</i>

21:54.459 --> 21:56.698
<i>that Alexus is becoming</i>
<i>the leader of the team.</i>

21:56.698 --> 21:58.100
<i>And I do not know why</i>

21:58.100 --> 21:59.604
these moms will not accept that.

21:59.604 --> 22:01.741
So who do we think's
gonna get the crown?

22:01.741 --> 22:02.910
(scoffs)

22:02.910 --> 22:04.479
KERRI: I definitely think
it's up for grabs.

22:04.479 --> 22:06.584
TIFFANIE: I'm 100% confident
Alexus will get the crown.

22:06.584 --> 22:08.387
Hey, you're talking
to the wrong person, honey.

22:10.926 --> 22:12.162
You're delusional.

22:12.162 --> 22:14.032
But then walk away.
Walk away.
You're delusional.

22:14.032 --> 22:16.436
My daughter's the best
one on this team!
Get in my face.

22:16.436 --> 22:18.440
Get in my face.
She leads this team.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.211
She's taught every single one
of your daughters at night
No. No.

22:20.211 --> 22:22.448
while you guys got drunk!
SARI:
No!

22:22.448 --> 22:24.587
You need to back up
out of my face.
Or what?

22:24.587 --> 22:26.423
You need to back up
out of my face.
Or what?!

22:26.423 --> 22:28.862
You need to back the (bleep)
out of my face, bitch.

22:28.862 --> 22:30.231
What's gonna happen?
You gonna hit me?

22:30.231 --> 22:31.601
Stop, you need to stop.
Oh, no, I'd never.

22:31.601 --> 22:32.803
What's gonna happen?
Never.

22:32.803 --> 22:33.838
Don't (bleep)
walk up to me, bitch.

22:33.838 --> 22:34.840
What's gonna happen?

22:34.840 --> 22:35.842
Stop it!
Or what?

22:35.842 --> 22:38.013
Stop! We're a team!

22:38.013 --> 22:39.951
I don't want to be
associated with trash.

22:39.951 --> 22:41.921
Whatever.
You guys, honestly, we have
to come together as a team.

22:41.921 --> 22:44.025
It's not a problem, it's‐‐
That's‐that's the problem.

22:49.537 --> 22:51.273
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up on</i> Dance Moms...

22:51.273 --> 22:52.610
JESSALYNN:
<i>Lindsley is a friend of mine</i>

22:52.610 --> 22:54.680
<i>and she danced with Prince.</i>

22:54.680 --> 22:56.083
LINDSLEY:
Okay, can we stop?

22:56.083 --> 22:57.653
It's very boring.

22:57.653 --> 22:59.155
JILL:
<i>We can't go down in flames</i>

22:59.155 --> 23:01.326
<i>like we did</i>
<i>with Michael Jackson.</i>

23:01.326 --> 23:02.328
We have teen group...

23:02.328 --> 23:05.869
We really need for this
to be amazing.

23:11.914 --> 23:14.720
<i>So, let me see what we have</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:16.958
with my beauty
pageant winners here.

23:16.958 --> 23:18.895
Let's go.

23:25.007 --> 23:28.715
YOLANDA: Tiffanie, you're
looking really, pretty solemn

23:28.715 --> 23:30.351
over there‐‐
what's going on?

23:30.351 --> 23:32.589
I‐I don't even know
what to say, I don't...

23:32.589 --> 23:34.059
Well, you obviously
have something to say.

23:34.059 --> 23:35.261
You had a lot to say yesterday.

23:35.261 --> 23:36.496
When? When we were here?

23:36.496 --> 23:37.700
I said it.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.371
<i>I'm really emotional</i>
<i>about my kid.</i>

23:40.371 --> 23:42.876
But I can't handle
this bickering.

23:42.876 --> 23:45.448
<i>I'm actually not gonna say</i>
<i>anything, because it affects</i>

23:45.448 --> 23:47.553
<i>Alexus.</i>
<i>She's so talented.</i>

23:47.553 --> 23:51.360
<i>I'm just gonna let her dancing</i>
<i>speak for itself.</i>

23:51.360 --> 23:53.063
Smile!

23:56.904 --> 23:59.142
<i>Acting‐wise,</i>

23:59.142 --> 24:00.579
the girls really need
to play this off well.

24:00.579 --> 24:04.386
<i>I want to see the girls act</i>
<i>like a winner.</i>

24:04.386 --> 24:05.822
Which one of these minis

24:05.822 --> 24:07.225
<i>is going to rise</i>
<i>to the occasion?</i>

24:07.225 --> 24:08.795
You just lift
my leg up.

24:08.795 --> 24:09.797
Not you.
You're not strong enough.

24:09.797 --> 24:11.066
You guys, you just lift it.

24:11.066 --> 24:12.101
You got to be strong.

24:12.101 --> 24:13.103
Like, you have to do the work.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.139
I can't‐‐ ooh!

24:14.139 --> 24:15.374
AREANNA:
I got it!
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

24:15.374 --> 24:17.245
Okay.
Oh, sorry about that.

24:17.245 --> 24:19.382
Ooh. Okay.
Thank you.

24:19.382 --> 24:21.019
I think we need
some acting here.

24:21.019 --> 24:23.424
You two are gonna be like,
(gasping)

24:23.424 --> 24:24.627
"Is it me?

24:24.627 --> 24:25.962
"Oh, my God,

24:25.962 --> 24:27.165
I'm so nervous."
(gasping)

24:27.165 --> 24:29.603
So, you need,
I need all that acting‐‐ go.

24:29.603 --> 24:30.972
What are they saying?
What are they doing?

24:30.972 --> 24:32.843
Is it me?
Look at each other.

24:32.843 --> 24:34.547
Is it me?
What are we doing?

24:34.547 --> 24:35.715
No, you're, like, sleeping.

24:35.715 --> 24:37.686
You like you're Helen Keller
or something.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.189
Go!

24:39.189 --> 24:40.391
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

24:42.295 --> 24:44.800
And you, put your hands on
your hips and be like this.

24:47.104 --> 24:49.075
Yes, okay, good.
Now,

24:49.075 --> 24:50.679
the person that I pick

24:50.679 --> 24:52.081
is gonna go...

24:52.081 --> 24:54.185
(gasps)

24:54.185 --> 24:57.559
And you're gonna step
forward out of the group.

24:57.559 --> 25:01.433
And you're gonna exit
stage left, waving.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.339
Okay, let me pretend.
JoJo and Brynn, come down.

25:04.339 --> 25:05.775
Back up a little bit.
JOJO:
Good luck.

25:05.775 --> 25:07.178
All right?

25:07.178 --> 25:09.048
And the winner is...

25:09.048 --> 25:10.619
♪ Dun dun dun dun. ♪

25:13.691 --> 25:15.194
Wave, do your wave.

25:15.194 --> 25:16.831
Wave pretty.
It's your‐‐ Go off.

25:16.831 --> 25:18.635
Exit stage left.

25:18.635 --> 25:20.839
Wave, wave.
Yes.

25:20.839 --> 25:22.108
Okay, let's try another girl.

25:23.578 --> 25:25.180
LINDSLEY:
<i>Hi!</i>

25:25.180 --> 25:26.751
How are you?

25:26.751 --> 25:28.220
Good to see you again.
Good to see you!

25:28.220 --> 25:30.357
Thank you so much for coming.

25:30.357 --> 25:31.627
Oh, you're so welcome!
I appreciate it so much.

25:31.627 --> 25:33.130
Lindsley is a friend of mine.

25:33.130 --> 25:34.567
And she danced with Prince.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.403
She danced with him
for five years.

25:36.403 --> 25:38.508
<i>And I think what a great</i>

25:38.508 --> 25:41.379
<i>real experience</i>
<i>for these girls</i>

25:41.379 --> 25:44.285
to get to know somebody
that danced with an artist

25:44.285 --> 25:47.091
that they're doing
a tribute to this week.

25:49.028 --> 25:51.667
So devastating, so sad.

25:51.667 --> 25:52.803
What did you do for him?

25:52.803 --> 25:54.339
I worked with from '92

25:54.339 --> 25:56.009
to '97.

25:56.009 --> 25:57.378
We had a group of us

25:57.378 --> 25:58.815
that were sort of his muses.

25:58.815 --> 26:00.284
Like a core group
of people.

26:00.284 --> 26:01.453
So we were with him

26:01.453 --> 26:04.425
every single day working
really closely with him.

26:04.425 --> 26:06.096
And I learned
so much from him.

26:06.096 --> 26:07.264
He was like this phenomenal

26:07.264 --> 26:09.402
genius master for sure.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.406
JESSALYNN: So, let's walk in
and talk to Abby.

26:11.406 --> 26:14.713
And just know that sometimes
she's open to things

26:14.713 --> 26:16.517
and sometimes she isn't...

26:16.517 --> 26:17.519
(moms talking over one another)

26:17.519 --> 26:19.288
Take my lead, and I got you.

26:19.288 --> 26:21.794
(laughter)

26:23.931 --> 26:25.000
There's no winner yet.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.436
We don't know who the winner is.

26:26.436 --> 26:27.706
So what is the winning
gonna be based off of?

26:27.706 --> 26:31.547
Their ability with Gianna,

26:31.547 --> 26:33.216
the performance aspect.

26:33.216 --> 26:35.154
Hello!

26:35.154 --> 26:36.524
So nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you.

26:36.524 --> 26:38.828
I‐I'm‐I'm, I hurt my knee,
so I'm not gonna get up.

26:38.828 --> 26:40.230
Don't think I'm rude.

26:40.230 --> 26:41.600
I'm‐I'm just not gonna
get up and down.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.936
Of course, no,
you take care of yourself.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.038
Okay?
It's great to see you.

26:44.038 --> 26:45.074
So great to see you.

26:45.074 --> 26:47.879
She also is here
if you want her

26:47.879 --> 26:50.084
to look at the dance.
Yes, yes.

26:50.084 --> 26:52.689
So, do you want
to dismiss this or‐‐?

26:52.689 --> 26:53.891
I‐I, yes.
Girls?

26:53.891 --> 26:55.327
You can go in here.

26:55.327 --> 26:56.564
I don't want to hear
any talking.

26:56.564 --> 26:58.768
And go ahead in, okay.

26:58.768 --> 27:01.473
JESSALYNN:
<i>I am so annoyed.</i>

27:01.473 --> 27:04.980
When the minis are here,
Abby is like a flake.

27:04.980 --> 27:06.684
<i>All right, and you know what?</i>

27:06.684 --> 27:07.819
<i>Something is gonna</i>
<i>give this week</i>

27:07.819 --> 27:09.288
<i>and it is not gonna be</i>

27:09.288 --> 27:11.226
this Prince tribute,
and I am going to make

27:11.226 --> 27:13.998
<i>sure of that, so I think</i>
<i>bringing in Lindsley is going</i>

27:13.998 --> 27:17.138
<i>give these girls</i>
<i>some insight on Prince and...</i>

27:17.138 --> 27:19.008
it's great for them
to do something like this.

27:19.008 --> 27:22.148
LINDSLEY:
So can I see what you guys have
been working on?

27:22.148 --> 27:24.152
(girls clamoring)

27:32.536 --> 27:35.007
♪ Sometimes I feel so tired ♪

27:35.007 --> 27:37.813
♪ So tired... ♪

27:37.813 --> 27:40.350
Okay, can we stop?

27:40.350 --> 27:41.987
It's very boring.

27:44.025 --> 27:46.062
I need you
to know what

27:46.062 --> 27:47.766
this song is about.

27:47.766 --> 27:49.001
And the story
that you are telling.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.005
So what do you hear

27:51.005 --> 27:52.208
when you hear this song?

27:58.688 --> 28:00.925
So, need to listen
to the lyrics,

28:00.925 --> 28:03.163
and if it's that essence
of "Purple Rain,"

28:03.163 --> 28:05.668
there's something really
magical happening, right?

28:05.668 --> 28:08.708
At the same time,
it's deep as well.

28:08.708 --> 28:09.943
I love that he was
very theatrical.

28:09.943 --> 28:12.381
You know,
he was such an artist.

28:12.381 --> 28:14.285
It wasn't just about the steps
or about the music,

28:14.285 --> 28:16.289
it was about
the entire story.

28:16.289 --> 28:17.458
Why do you lift your arms?

28:17.458 --> 28:18.561
Instead of just
putting them out there,

28:18.561 --> 28:20.364
it has to come from your heart.

28:20.364 --> 28:22.569
Right, you need to feel,
you need to fill up the space

28:22.569 --> 28:24.205
around you‐‐ ah!

28:24.205 --> 28:26.677
So I just need some more meaning
behind your movement.

28:26.677 --> 28:28.915
Let's start again.

28:36.095 --> 28:38.166
Yes, better!

28:38.166 --> 28:41.172
♪ Dry off your purple tears ♪

28:41.172 --> 28:43.410
♪ And look deep... ♪

28:43.410 --> 28:45.848
Good!
Much better!

28:45.848 --> 28:47.686
Did you guys feel
a little bit better?

28:47.686 --> 28:50.357
I felt like
I could feel more.

28:50.357 --> 28:52.996
Kendall, when you did
your little‐‐ excuse me.

28:52.996 --> 28:55.033
When you did your little thing
and you're facing that way,

28:55.033 --> 28:58.039
um, you were a contraction
and release‐‐ bigger.

28:58.039 --> 29:01.045
Bigger, bigger,
bigger, bigger, bigger.

29:01.045 --> 29:02.682
The‐the music is powerful.

29:02.682 --> 29:05.187
So I need my girls
to be powerful.

29:05.187 --> 29:07.324
As far as a professional dancer
coming into my studio

29:07.324 --> 29:11.032
and sharing intimate details of

29:11.032 --> 29:13.103
<i>a working relationship</i>
<i>with Prince,</i>

29:13.103 --> 29:15.073
<i>that's wonderful.</i>

29:15.073 --> 29:17.144
<i>But we're doing</i>
<i>a routine in two days,</i>

29:17.144 --> 29:18.914
<i>so we can make changes,</i>

29:18.914 --> 29:21.854
<i>but that's an evolution,</i>

29:21.854 --> 29:23.858
<i>and in Prince's world</i>
<i>at Paisley Park,</i>

29:23.858 --> 29:24.926
<i>that happens.</i>

29:24.926 --> 29:26.530
<i>At the Abby Lee Dance Company,</i>

29:26.530 --> 29:28.166
we don't always
have time for that.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.103
Bye, guys.

29:44.031 --> 29:45.167
Say again.

29:49.676 --> 29:50.711
What?!

29:57.191 --> 29:58.627
I want to do the duet...

29:58.627 --> 30:00.197
I‐I, sweetheart,
I love you.

30:00.197 --> 30:01.934
I know what you mean.
I know what you mean.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.436
NIA: <i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's not wanting.</i>

30:03.436 --> 30:06.409
You don't feel up
to this duet this week

30:06.409 --> 30:09.616
for competition in‐in a day,
to leave tomorrow.

30:09.616 --> 30:11.352
Okay.

30:11.352 --> 30:12.922
HOLLY:
<i>Nia's not feeling well.</i>

30:12.922 --> 30:14.358
<i>It's one thing for her</i>

30:14.358 --> 30:15.895
to perform in the group number
this week,

30:15.895 --> 30:18.567
especially since she doesn't
have a featured role in it.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.505
<i>But Nia's been waiting to do</i>

30:20.505 --> 30:21.940
a Beyoncé‐inspired dance,

30:21.940 --> 30:23.209
and if she was
to do it this week,

30:23.209 --> 30:24.646
she wouldn't do it justice.

30:24.646 --> 30:26.917
KIRA: Did you know
she was doing that?

30:26.917 --> 30:28.821
Did you know she was
feeling that way

30:28.821 --> 30:30.257
or did she just
decide on her own?

30:30.257 --> 30:31.693
I know she was trying to figure
out what she was going to do.

30:31.693 --> 30:33.129
She wasn't,
she wasn't feeling well

30:33.129 --> 30:34.599
when she came back from school.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.603
And I said, "Well,
it's gonna be up to you."

30:36.603 --> 30:40.177
KIRA: <i>That's her icon,</i>
<i>so she doesn't want to‐‐</i>

30:40.177 --> 30:41.947
You don't want to do Beyoncé
and be wimpy about it.

30:41.947 --> 30:43.651
Beyoncé's not a wimpy...

30:43.651 --> 30:45.655
JESSALYNN:
No. She's already had

30:45.655 --> 30:48.026
duo trouble, like,
you're coming off of a good win.

30:48.026 --> 30:49.996
There's no need.
HOLLY:
Exactly.

30:49.996 --> 30:51.265
KENDALL: <i>If we were to do</i>
<i>the duet this week,</i>

30:51.265 --> 30:53.102
would you give me,

30:53.102 --> 30:56.342
like, would I do it Kalani
since she's the only one

30:56.342 --> 30:57.946
who doesn't have a duo?

30:57.946 --> 30:59.649
ABBY LEE:
Kalani?

31:04.391 --> 31:05.661
ABBY LEE:
Yeah.

31:05.661 --> 31:08.534
The last time
you guys did a duet,

31:08.534 --> 31:09.903
your back was bothering you.

31:09.903 --> 31:11.540
We pulled you,
we stuck Nia in.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.476
It was a hot mess.
They did not know it.

31:13.476 --> 31:16.382
Now, it's the reverse.

31:16.382 --> 31:18.253
Nia's sick,
you're gonna jump in.

31:18.253 --> 31:21.058
I'm a little nervous
for my duet this week.

31:21.058 --> 31:23.964
Kalani's just been
thrown into my duet and

31:23.964 --> 31:27.271
<i>I hope Kalani and I can just</i>
<i>get through it this week 'cause</i>

31:27.271 --> 31:30.377
I really just want to keep up my
good streak that I have going.

31:30.377 --> 31:33.016
ABBY LEE: So, girls,
the name of your routine.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.688
is TBA, to be determined.

31:35.688 --> 31:37.024
It's gonna be connected,

31:37.024 --> 31:39.562
it's gonna be wired,

31:39.562 --> 31:41.900
it's going to be
lost connection.

31:41.900 --> 31:42.969
Something like that.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.106
It's not gonna be "Telephone."

31:45.106 --> 31:46.442
Like Lady Gaga and Beyonce.

31:46.442 --> 31:48.379
Not gonna be that, all right.

31:48.379 --> 31:50.718
<i>I already had plans.</i>

31:50.718 --> 31:52.689
Now we need to see
what we can come up with

31:52.689 --> 31:54.291
for Kalani and Kendall.

31:54.291 --> 31:56.530
<i>It's not the Lady Gaga</i>
<i>and Beyonce thing anymore.</i>

31:56.530 --> 31:57.532
<i>(makes whoosh sound)</i>

31:57.532 --> 31:58.567
That went out the tubes

31:58.567 --> 32:00.604
with Nia and her illness.

32:00.604 --> 32:02.140
<i>This has to be</i>
<i>something different.</i>

32:02.140 --> 32:03.677
<i>But because...</i>

32:03.677 --> 32:05.146
we already invested
time and energy

32:05.146 --> 32:07.685
<i>in the cord choreography,</i>

32:07.685 --> 32:09.522
we're going with this.

32:09.522 --> 32:11.526
I would go from the top
and just try to do something.

32:11.526 --> 32:14.566
Go.

32:14.566 --> 32:15.668
See that?

32:15.668 --> 32:17.905
You're‐‐ you want to
show the audience

32:17.905 --> 32:19.441
that you have this cord here.

32:20.611 --> 32:21.613
Yes.

32:21.613 --> 32:22.882
Now go.

32:22.882 --> 32:25.120

<i>in this duet</i>

32:37.010 --> 32:39.516

32:39.516 --> 32:40.885
They have a phone cord.

HOLLY:
Oh, yeah.

33:01.626 --> 33:02.762
They're still learning.
JILL:
Well...

33:02.762 --> 33:04.999
ABBY LEE:
Kendall, you could twist her

33:04.999 --> 33:06.736
and step behind yourself

33:06.736 --> 33:07.738
to over here.

33:12.849 --> 33:14.752
They don't even know

33:14.752 --> 33:16.455
The cord is gonna
come out of their hands,

33:16.455 --> 33:17.992
it's gonna poke someone
in the eye.

33:17.992 --> 33:19.428
It's bad news.

33:19.428 --> 33:22.935
ABBY LEE: You have to worry
about your feet in the mirror.

33:22.935 --> 33:25.039
And that's what scares me,
is you don't...

33:25.039 --> 33:27.143
You've done it wrong 100 times,
and every time you practice it,

33:27.143 --> 33:28.881
goofing around wrong,

33:28.881 --> 33:31.553
you're putting it in

<i>Kendall and Kalani are gonna</i>
<i>really need to buckle down.</i>

33:34.191 --> 33:36.796

into the rehearsal week.

33:36.796 --> 33:40.103
<i>And these girls,</i>
<i>they have to learn this fast.</i>

33:40.103 --> 33:42.173

Abby, what's your vision for...

42:42.252 --> 42:45.359
Brynn and JoJo?

42:45.359 --> 42:46.862
Because they both
have the same blonde hair,

42:46.862 --> 42:48.064

42:57.016 --> 42:58.051
It was, yeah.

42:58.051 --> 42:59.453
Well, whatever her reasons are,

42:59.453 --> 43:01.257
the choreography is good
and the costume is beautiful,

43:01.257 --> 43:02.761

your mothers learned

53:43.775 --> 53:45.210
We can't go down in flames

53:45.210 --> 53:46.847
like we did
with Michael Jackson

53:46.847 --> 53:49.485
<i>and then we did with Madonna.</i>

53:49.485 --> 53:53.561
We really need for this
to be freaking amazing.

ASHLEE:
<i>This was my favorite group</i>
<i>dance of the season so far.</i>

56:12.071 --> 56:16.212
<i>I feel like they nailed it, but</i>
<i>it's a big competition today.</i>

56:16.212 --> 56:17.649
<i>There's a lot of kids here.</i>

56:17.649 --> 56:19.151
<i>I don't think it's</i>
<i>gonna be an easy win.</i>

56:19.151 --> 56:22.291
I hope the judges think
it's as amazing as we did.

56:22.291 --> 56:24.930
ANNOUNCER:
All right, did we have
a good time today?

56:24.930 --> 56:26.734
Yeah, okay.
(all cheering)

56:26.734 --> 56:29.472
You ready for some awards?

56:29.472 --> 56:31.744
(louder cheering)

56:36.954 --> 56:40.394
So, let's get ready
for our pre‐teen duet.

56:40.394 --> 56:42.231
JESSALYNN:
<i>I have to give it to Abby.</i>

56:42.231 --> 56:43.400
Our dances are good this week.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.805
<i>You know, we want the girls</i>
<i>to continue to get</i>

56:45.805 --> 56:47.441
difficult, new,
creative choreography.

56:47.441 --> 56:49.980
<i>And if these girls</i>
<i>don't bring home a win,</i>

56:49.980 --> 56:52.184
Abby might not
do that anymore, you know?

56:52.184 --> 56:55.257
We might get washed‐up routines
that Abby did ten years ago.

56:55.257 --> 56:56.927
ANNOUNCER:
Third place entry number 53,

56:56.927 --> 56:59.332

In first place...

57:10.855 --> 57:14.228

"Mirror Image."

57:14.228 --> 57:17.569
(audience cheering)

57:17.569 --> 57:20.374
Brynn and JoJo
winning the category is great.

57:20.374 --> 57:22.679
<i>And you know, watching</i>
<i>our kids become friends,</i>

57:22.679 --> 57:24.716
<i>it definitely inspires</i>
<i>the mothers to get along.</i>

57:24.716 --> 57:26.954
New beginnings,
it's just new beginnings.

57:26.954 --> 57:28.858
ANNOUNCER:
We have teen duet.

57:28.858 --> 57:31.462
This has been a great start
for Kendall.

57:31.462 --> 57:33.567
<i>She's had great dances</i>
<i>every week.</i>

57:33.567 --> 57:35.370
<i>And I don't want that to stop.</i>

57:35.370 --> 57:38.009
<i>Bigger and better things</i>
<i>will come for Kendall.</i>

57:38.009 --> 57:40.247
If she keeps getting
great choreography

57:40.247 --> 57:41.717
and she keeps winning,

57:41.717 --> 57:43.286
she'll get more and more
attention from Abby.

57:43.286 --> 57:46.660
ANNOUNCER; Third place,
entry number 55, "Us."

57:46.660 --> 57:48.129
(cheering)

57:48.129 --> 57:50.902
Second place...

57:57.381 --> 57:59.519
ABBY LEE:
<i>Coming up</i> on Dance Moms...

57:59.519 --> 58:00.555
We have teen group.

58:00.555 --> 58:02.124
KIRA: <i>Our track record</i>
<i>with tribute dances</i>

58:02.124 --> 58:03.393
<i>isn't the best.</i>

58:03.393 --> 58:05.832
Second place...

58:09.706 --> 58:11.577
ANNOUNCER:
<i>We have teen duet.</i>

58:13.012 --> 58:15.918
Second place, entry number 54,

58:15.918 --> 58:17.287
"The River."

58:17.287 --> 58:18.858
And first place

58:18.858 --> 58:22.699
in the teen duet category
goes to...

58:27.842 --> 58:29.813
...entry number 82,
"Disconnected."

58:29.813 --> 58:32.685
(audience cheering)

58:32.685 --> 58:35.257
KALANI:
<i>Kendall and I have wanted</i>

58:35.257 --> 58:36.894
to have an amazing duet
for such a long time.

58:36.894 --> 58:37.896
And we finally did,

58:37.896 --> 58:40.735
<i>and we went on stage</i>
<i>and killed it.</i>

58:40.735 --> 58:42.939
<i>It's such a great feeling</i>
<i>knowing that we won.</i>

58:42.939 --> 58:45.010
<i>I mean, who doesn't</i>
<i>love winning?</i>

58:45.010 --> 58:45.912
(laughs)

58:45.912 --> 58:47.782
Next we have
Small Wonders Group.

58:51.289 --> 58:53.359
Second place,

58:53.359 --> 58:56.567
entry number ten,
"The Juice Crew."

58:56.567 --> 58:58.102
(applause)

58:58.102 --> 58:59.706
And first place
in the Small Wonders Group...

59:04.248 --> 59:06.687
...goes to entry number 80,
"Cali Cuties."

59:06.687 --> 59:08.757
(cheering)

59:11.597 --> 59:14.001
YOLANDA:
<i>I'm so proud of the girls.</i>

59:14.001 --> 59:16.439
I knew exactly
where they would be,

59:16.439 --> 59:17.842
and that was gonna be on top.

59:17.842 --> 59:19.244
And that's where they were.

59:20.413 --> 59:21.415
We have Teen Group.

59:21.415 --> 59:24.188
KIRA:
<i>This Prince dance was fabulous,</i>

59:24.188 --> 59:26.660
but our track record
with tribute dances

59:26.660 --> 59:28.797
<i>isn't the best.</i>

59:28.797 --> 59:30.400
<i>We sure as heck</i>
<i>better win with Prince.</i>

59:30.400 --> 59:32.337
ANNOUNCER:
Second place...

59:35.010 --> 59:37.180
...entry number 83,
"Purple Fame."

59:37.180 --> 59:38.282
(applause)

59:38.282 --> 59:39.786
JILL:
<i>I don't know.</i>

59:39.786 --> 59:43.092
<i>Abby tried to give equal</i>
<i>amounts of time to the elites</i>

59:43.092 --> 59:44.428
and the minis.

59:44.428 --> 59:46.833
In the end,
it worked out for the minis.

59:46.833 --> 59:49.204
<i>It did not work out</i>
<i>for the elites.</i>

59:49.204 --> 59:51.543
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>It shouldn't be equal.</i>

59:51.543 --> 59:54.181
<i>We have been here</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

59:54.181 --> 59:56.152
The elites should be
Abby's priority.

59:56.152 --> 59:59.191
<i>They always were before.</i>

59:59.191 --> 1:00:02.164
You proud of the girls?
All of them?

1:00:02.164 --> 1:00:03.299
Your minis won.
ABBY LEE: I'm proud of them.

1:00:03.299 --> 1:00:05.036
The minis did well.
They were great.

1:00:05.036 --> 1:00:06.907
What did you think?
I want your honest opinion.

1:00:06.907 --> 1:00:09.211
As far as we're concerned,
you had a good week.

1:00:09.211 --> 1:00:12.484
And we're still having trouble
getting the group together.

1:00:12.484 --> 1:00:15.490
I thought our new Lilli
as a group member was good.

1:00:15.490 --> 1:00:17.528
Do you think she's
a good part of the team?

1:00:17.528 --> 1:00:19.599
Absolutely, yes.

1:00:19.599 --> 1:00:21.502
And you've been
very well‐behaved.
Thank you.

1:00:21.502 --> 1:00:24.576
<i>So far,</i>
<i>Lilliana and her mother,</i>

1:00:24.576 --> 1:00:26.345
<i>who is a psychologist,</i>

1:00:26.345 --> 1:00:28.449
<i>have been a fabulous fit</i>

1:00:28.449 --> 1:00:29.886
to this group.

1:00:29.886 --> 1:00:31.923
I think the mother is going

1:00:31.923 --> 1:00:34.963
<i>to have an analysis</i>
<i>for me at the end</i>

1:00:34.963 --> 1:00:36.900
of a couple weeks
on everyone's behavior.

1:00:36.900 --> 1:00:39.037
Because there are
some psychos here.

1:00:39.037 --> 1:00:40.975
<i>That's definite.</i>

1:00:40.975 --> 1:00:42.545
Now, who's the mother
with the mouth? You.

1:00:42.545 --> 1:00:45.083
I'd watch what you're giving up

1:00:45.083 --> 1:00:47.387
and you're sacrificing
and blah, blah, blah.

1:00:47.387 --> 1:00:49.559
I can find a lot of kids

1:00:49.559 --> 1:00:52.598
that can do four walks forward
and a hip and a hip.

1:00:53.534 --> 1:00:55.571
Everyone's replaceable.

1:00:55.571 --> 1:00:58.142
She still took the part that you
gave her and made it her own,

1:00:58.142 --> 1:00:59.813
and she shined
on that stage.

1:00:59.813 --> 1:01:01.650
She stole the show today.

1:01:02.752 --> 1:01:05.256
KIRA: I don't think
<i>she</i> stole the show.

1:01:05.256 --> 1:01:06.492
I think <i>your</i> little girl
stole the show

1:01:06.492 --> 1:01:07.728
when she walked off stage!

1:01:07.728 --> 1:01:10.768
That was so funny!
That was good.

1:01:10.768 --> 1:01:12.470
She said...
She was all...

1:01:12.470 --> 1:01:14.742
YOLANDA: She put it out there.
She put it out there.

1:01:14.742 --> 1:01:16.045
KIRA: The mom that has
the mouth, that talks,

1:01:16.045 --> 1:01:17.548
that thinks their
daughter's all that‐‐

1:01:17.548 --> 1:01:19.451
I don't think she's all that.
I just said‐‐

1:01:19.451 --> 1:01:21.055
You just said
she stole the show!

1:01:21.055 --> 1:01:23.192
You basically said she was
the only one on the stage

1:01:23.192 --> 1:01:24.361
that did anything.

1:01:24.361 --> 1:01:26.398
No, I do think
my daughter's good.

1:01:26.398 --> 1:01:27.735
KIRA:
Abby?

1:01:27.735 --> 1:01:28.937
Thank you.

1:01:28.937 --> 1:01:30.574
I think you need
to get off your knee now

1:01:30.574 --> 1:01:32.143
and go catch your flight.

1:01:32.143 --> 1:01:33.446
Yes, okay.
So, thank you.

1:01:33.446 --> 1:01:34.782
Thank you.
ABBY LEE:
Girls, thank you.

1:01:34.782 --> 1:01:36.118
GIRLS:
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetheart.

1:01:36.118 --> 1:01:37.622
Thank you, thank you.

1:01:37.622 --> 1:01:39.224
Bye, babe, bye.
Thank you, Miss Abby.

1:01:39.224 --> 1:01:41.428
I definitely think
the minis can handle

1:01:41.428 --> 1:01:43.767
<i>the pressure of a competition.</i>

1:01:43.767 --> 1:01:45.203
<i>I think they have</i>
<i>what it takes.</i>

1:01:45.203 --> 1:01:46.706
<i>But their mothers?</i>

1:01:46.706 --> 1:01:48.777
<i>No way in hell!</i>

1:01:48.777 --> 1:01:51.015
<i>Their mothers all act like</i>
<i>they're in seventh grade.</i>

1:01:51.015 --> 1:01:52.518
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

1:01:52.518 --> 1:01:56.425
Do you feel bad that you stole
the crown from your daughter?

1:01:56.425 --> 1:01:59.164
She pretty much had the crown,

1:01:59.164 --> 1:02:00.868
and your mouth stole it.

1:02:00.868 --> 1:02:02.605
That crown does not define you.

1:02:02.605 --> 1:02:04.041
Alexus was amazing
on that stage, period.

1:02:04.041 --> 1:02:05.577
(laughs)
Oh, now it doesn't.

1:02:05.577 --> 1:02:06.813
It doesn't now?

1:02:06.813 --> 1:02:08.316
Performing on that stage

1:02:08.316 --> 1:02:09.786
defines Alexus and a dancer.

1:02:09.786 --> 1:02:11.823
And she was fabulous.

1:02:11.823 --> 1:02:14.796
She's the one that you looked
at through the whole routine.

1:02:14.796 --> 1:02:16.465
I bet you a three‐year‐old
can jazz walk

1:02:16.465 --> 1:02:17.768
just as well as she can.

1:02:17.768 --> 1:02:19.872
Watch, I can do it.

1:02:19.872 --> 1:02:21.342
In heels, I can do it.

1:02:21.342 --> 1:02:22.578
In heels.

1:02:22.578 --> 1:02:23.647
That's not hard.

1:02:25.016 --> 1:02:27.621
Someplace where we continue
to struggle is the teamwork.

1:02:27.621 --> 1:02:29.625
And it continues
to hamper our abilities

1:02:29.625 --> 1:02:30.894
to be able to get
to where we want to be.

1:02:30.894 --> 1:02:32.297
Well, we can't be a team

1:02:32.297 --> 1:02:33.867
if someone says their
daughter stole the show.

1:02:33.867 --> 1:02:36.539
YOLANDA:
As long as you continue

1:02:36.539 --> 1:02:39.545
to go ahead
and just put your child

1:02:39.545 --> 1:02:40.681
above everybody else,
above the team,

1:02:40.681 --> 1:02:42.317
our girls
are being affected.

1:02:42.317 --> 1:02:44.622
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't want

1:02:44.622 --> 1:02:46.960
my daughter to shine
on the stage. It'd be a lie.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.964
It's always my, my, my, my, my!

1:02:48.964 --> 1:02:51.268
How about we say
we, we, we, we, we?

1:02:51.268 --> 1:02:53.840
We've got to look at,
like, different pronouns.

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:56.412
I'm here for my daughter.
That's what it is.

1:02:57.414 --> 1:02:59.217
I want
my daughter

1:02:59.217 --> 1:03:01.221
to be the next Maddie‐‐
Maddie was amazing!

1:03:01.221 --> 1:03:03.059
KERRI:
My throat is dry

1:03:03.059 --> 1:03:05.463
by talking to somebody
who won't listen.

1:03:06.666 --> 1:03:08.904
Okay, you know what?
Yeah.

1:03:11.308 --> 1:03:13.747
ABBY LEE:
<i>Next on</i> Dance Moms...

1:03:13.747 --> 1:03:16.185
KIRA: I feel like this is gonna
be the cheesiest number ever.

1:03:16.185 --> 1:03:17.988
Abby, this cannot go on stage.

1:03:17.988 --> 1:03:19.859
None of the kids
are doing this number.

1:03:19.859 --> 1:03:22.297
ASHLEE: <i>The first week</i>
<i>we actually get a lyrical,</i>

1:03:22.297 --> 1:03:24.267
<i>you guys pull out</i>
<i>of the competition.</i>

1:03:24.267 --> 1:03:25.036
You are delusional!

1:03:25.036 --> 1:03:26.806
We get under their skin.

1:03:26.806 --> 1:03:29.144
They would not be this bothered
if they were not threatened.

1:03:29.144 --> 1:03:31.683
KIRA: <i>I'm not gonna let a bunch</i>
<i>of mothers of seven‐year‐olds</i>

1:03:31.683 --> 1:03:33.119
degrade our children.

1:03:33.119 --> 1:03:34.321
We need to know where you stand.

1:03:34.321 --> 1:03:35.657
KIRA:
Get out!

1:03:35.657 --> 1:03:38.295
Get out!

1:03:38.295 --> 1:03:39.297
Are you injured in any way?

1:03:39.297 --> 1:03:41.936
You're a role model!
Who are you?
