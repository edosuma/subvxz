it was a great comfort.

That, my friend,

-Yeah, let me guess.

Bring me the key people you trust.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.456
I got a story to tell.

15:20.127 --> 15:24.089
[Ms. Gillies] Okay. We have a very sick
kid here. He barfed clear across the room.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.341
What's wrong with him?

15:27.092 --> 15:31.597
All right, let's have a look at you.
Come on. Come on, let's go.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.560
Let's have a look at you. That's it.
Right through here. There you go.

Where do you think you're going?

And if he's contagious,

15:43.442 --> 15:44.735
he'll infect your whole department.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.155
Let's keep this open.

[Ms. Gillies] We can watch from here.
He'll never be out of your sight.

So he doesn't notice.

16:18.852 --> 16:21.605

They'll do anything to get out of school.

Anything.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.079
I'm sorry we made you sick.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.165
It was the only way
I could get to see you.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.500
I missed you.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.754
We have to be apart
just a little bit longer.

16:45.838 --> 16:50.009
But, listen, the revolution is happening.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.469
[Ms. Gillies] It must be so interesting,
working with all the...

16:52.553 --> 16:54.555
[Josie] Layton's with us. He's got a plan.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.017
-Tell Layton I'm ready.
-Good man.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.563
We might not see you before it starts.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.025
There's something really important
we need you to do.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.947
[imperceptible]

17:12.031 --> 17:15.617
[Ms. Gillies] What's it like working for
Mr. Wilford? He's such a fascinating...

17:15.701 --> 17:16.660
Goodbye, Mom.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.873
[Ms. Gillies] I don't know how you deal
with all this. The pressure you're under--

17:20.956 --> 17:23.417
Tell me about your Engine.
Tell me about the Engine.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.313
Well, look at you.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.191
The whole car to ourselves?

18:11.381 --> 18:15.636
-[Grey] Something wrong?
-No, no, no, nothing. No.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.890
It's just been a while since I, um...
[clears throat]

18:19.973 --> 18:24.103
[chuckles] Dated?
I find that hard to believe.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.312
[Ruth chuckles]

18:26.980 --> 18:27.856
Well...

18:28.732 --> 18:31.276
there aren't a lot of options
on <i>Snowpiercer,</i> are there?

18:32.694 --> 18:34.947
Everyone boarded two by two, didn't they?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.116
Except me.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.037
So how did you come to be
in <i>Snowpiercer, </i>then?

18:42.830 --> 18:47.793
Uh-huh. Well, in the old world,
I had a B and B in Kendal.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.296
And one night,
in the middle of this rainstorm, this...

18:53.048 --> 18:55.968
-strange man turned up.
-[chuckles]

18:56.051 --> 18:59.972
He had no reservation. He had no luggage.
He was soaked to the bone.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.976
And it was the off-season, so I took it
upon myself to look after him, you know,

19:04.059 --> 19:06.937
and make sure he had everything he needed,
and we got to talking.

19:07.855 --> 19:13.485
Then he told me all about this fabulous
luxury liner that he was building.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.615
Said he needed people just like me,
and gave me a job on the spot.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.075
[Grey] Mmm-hmm.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.328
That's how I met Mr. Wilford.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.666
Well, we're very lucky he found you.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.378
To his health.

19:34.506 --> 19:35.591
His health.

19:44.391 --> 19:46.393
Can I ask you something, though, Nolan?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.813
Your wife died two years ago.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.567
Why now?

19:56.069 --> 19:59.573
I wanted to talk to you for a while now.
That's the truth.

20:02.367 --> 20:07.039
But I have to be honest.
There's another aspect to this luncheon.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.123
[Robert] Ruth.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.376
Commander. Perfect day for fish.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.796
It's lovely to see you, Ruth.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.841
I was just saying to Robert,
it's been too long since we chatted.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.428
Uh... Yes. Well, yes, been a long time.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.264
We have to discuss something, Ruthie.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.433
[Robert] Ruth...

20:27.476 --> 20:32.272
in a nutshell, a number of passengers
feel that Melanie has too much power,

20:32.356 --> 20:35.317
too much influence with Mr. Wilford.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.076
-Well, I'm not sure that I--
-We think it's time for a change.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.579
If that were to happen,
would you be interested in stepping up?

20:50.499 --> 20:52.417
You want to replace Melanie?

20:52.501 --> 20:54.753
Well, if Third can petition
to change the trial,

20:54.836 --> 20:56.880
we can petition to change management.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.220
Right, Nolan.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.931
-That's what this is about, is it?
-Ruth.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.894
I don't express my feelings well,
but I meant what I said.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.816
The only reason I'd even consider this
is my faith in you.

21:17.317 --> 21:21.321
And just think,
you'd be working with Mr. Wilford,

21:21.405 --> 21:22.781
where you belong.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.079
-[indistinct chatter]
-[upbeat music playing]

21:42.426 --> 21:43.510
What's going on?

21:51.101 --> 21:52.102
Hello.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.275
I'm here to talk about Andre.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.778
Layton? Isn't he in... in the Tail?

22:04.072 --> 22:05.949
I understand you're pregnant.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.036
Congratulations.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.872
That's wonderful news.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.501
You know, it's a privilege
to have a child on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

22:17.878 --> 22:19.087
It's not a right.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.089
And privileges...

22:21.882 --> 22:24.926
well, they can be taken away
just as easily as they're given.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.514
So...

22:33.185 --> 22:34.770
who helped him escape?

22:44.362 --> 22:45.781
[Miss Audrey] Layton deserves to be heard.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.324
[Astrid] He speaks for the Tail.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.493
I don't know any Tailies,
and I don't know you.

22:49.576 --> 22:53.246
Your people have got nothing to lose.
I mean, it's bad up here, but it's a life.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.581
And what are you gonna replace it with?

22:54.664 --> 22:58.835
Look, Layton wants what we want.
No classes, no borders.

22:58.919 --> 23:03.006
-Equal labor, equal rations.
-But the Tailies want space.

23:03.090 --> 23:06.343
-What about that?
-We are not coming for your beds.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.845
First Class has a bowling alley, okay?

23:08.929 --> 23:11.348
There is plenty of space
on this train to go around.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.974
There are 300 Brakemen and Jackboots

23:13.058 --> 23:14.059
-on this train.
-Yes.

23:14.142 --> 23:17.020
It's a ten-mile march from Tail to Engine.
Thousands of doors.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.523
Okay, what if I told you
all those doors could be open?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.693
That I could bring an army of almost 400,

23:23.777 --> 23:26.404
and with what I know,
we could take down this train in one move?

23:26.488 --> 23:27.989
I'd say, "Spit it out."

23:39.668 --> 23:42.003
I got thrown in a drawer
for what I learned.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.757
About the man in the Engine.

23:48.510 --> 23:52.305
I pulled back the curtain, and I found out
something that, deep down...

23:54.391 --> 23:56.143
I think you all already know.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.569
[Jackboot] This is an inspection! Line up!

24:20.792 --> 24:22.169
My name is Melanie.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.258
You don't know me,
but I speak for Mr. Wilford.

24:29.676 --> 24:33.638
You've rebelled against the order
of this train many times.

24:34.264 --> 24:38.185
Your brothers and sisters have died.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.980
Your children have died.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.358
And you have nothing to show for it.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.361
I'm here to tell you,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.157
if you try again,

24:54.242 --> 24:55.869
you will fail again.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.128
[Tailies murmuring]

25:25.815 --> 25:27.400
That's her. That's Josie.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.403
[Big John] No!

25:31.488 --> 25:35.033
No! No! Let me go!

25:35.116 --> 25:37.535
-Don't take her! Josie!
-[man] Traitor!

25:38.036 --> 25:39.829
[Tailies clamoring]

26:03.645 --> 26:06.022
[Josie breathing heavily]

26:31.965 --> 26:33.633
[Josie panting]

26:40.307 --> 26:43.226
Thank you, Brakeman.
You can wait outside with the others.

26:43.935 --> 26:45.645
Who will conduct the interrogation?

26:46.980 --> 26:48.273
You can go now.

27:01.995 --> 27:02.996
[softly] Fuck.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.001
[breathing shakily]

27:09.502 --> 27:10.712
[Melanie] I know you're scared.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.299
I'd like to resolve this
without you getting hurt.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.511
I just want to know where Layton is.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.938
It was hard for Zarah, too.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.943
She made the right choice by cooperating.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.445
She'll be rewarded for it.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.949
If you help me, I can do the same for you.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.040
There's still time
to save yourself, Josie.

27:50.460 --> 27:52.253
I know there's no Wilford.

27:54.047 --> 27:56.841
And I know you put Layton in a drawer
because he figured that out,

27:56.925 --> 28:01.971
so I know you won't let me go
no matter what you're about to promise.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.270
Well, if you know that,
then you know why I need to find him.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.775
And you know I'll do anything necessary
to make it happen.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.443
Including using Miles?

28:17.237 --> 28:19.906
Did you know his mother died
getting on this train?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.660
He was alone in the world
when I found him,

28:23.743 --> 28:25.995
and now you're gonna take me as well.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.832
Well, he's part of my family now.

28:30.750 --> 28:36.464
And you can stay in his life...
if you make the right choice.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.593
All the things you've done.

28:41.261 --> 28:43.304
All those things you're hiding.

28:43.972 --> 28:48.893
Wilford's death. Murders.
Children in drawers.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.987
You must have had your reasons.
You must have.

29:02.323 --> 29:07.412
But you have to know, deep down somewhere,
that none of this is right.

29:08.830 --> 29:12.876
Mr. Wilford engineered <i>Snowpiercer</i>
to function in a certain way.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.795
If I'd have created it,

29:15.879 --> 29:19.299
I would have created a different world,
a more just world. But I didn't.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.844
I inherited someone else's creation.

29:26.097 --> 29:30.143
People seem to think
that those in power answer to no one.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.104
They're free to do as they choose.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.856
It couldn't be further from the truth.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.816
The person in power answers to everyone.

29:37.942 --> 29:43.656
I make choices... not because I want to,
but because everyone demands it.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.116
The train demands it.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.999
What made you like this?

29:59.214 --> 30:02.926
Nothing I say can ever make you talk,
can it?

30:29.661 --> 30:32.080
[breath trembling]

30:41.047 --> 30:42.257
[Melanie] Where is Layton?

30:47.011 --> 30:49.055
[gasping in fear]

30:50.723 --> 30:53.351
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.353
[screams] No!

31:03.111 --> 31:05.697
[screaming]

31:08.366 --> 31:10.201
I... [grunting]

31:11.619 --> 31:13.454
You just... [grunting]

31:21.713 --> 31:22.589
Where is Layton?

31:24.340 --> 31:25.341
[yelling] Where is he?

31:26.885 --> 31:27.886
Please.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.638
Please.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.767
[screams]

31:37.854 --> 31:39.063
[upbeat music playing]

31:57.040 --> 32:01.586
Janitorial is the most corrupt crew
on this train. We can't trust him.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.755
I don't trust him, but we need him.

32:03.838 --> 32:04.672
[Miss Audrey] Mmm.

32:10.929 --> 32:14.098
A fugitive, a janitor and a madam
walked into a bar--

32:14.182 --> 32:16.559
[Layton] The last time we met, Terence,
we had a conversation

32:16.643 --> 32:19.771
-about Third and the Tail.
-I remember.

32:21.230 --> 32:25.109
What this guy is proposing
is an awfully bloody business for you.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.905
-There will be blood, Terence.
-Yes.

32:30.031 --> 32:34.202
Your sad, rich clients uptrain
will want yours.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.454
[chuckles]

32:39.082 --> 32:41.960
Melanie Cavill
came asking about you today.

32:42.794 --> 32:43.962
What'd you tell her?

32:46.798 --> 32:51.135
That, uh, if I saw you, I'd rat you out.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.638
So?

32:57.100 --> 33:00.311
Come on. I'm not gonna play favorites.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.730
You're gonna have to one of these days.

33:03.314 --> 33:07.777
Uniting the classes,
it's just never gonna work.

33:07.860 --> 33:12.782
You gotta want it, Terence.
The will of the people.

33:15.702 --> 33:19.664
I don't wanna be callous,
but it's just math.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.208
You don't have the numbers.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.420
So, um...

33:27.088 --> 33:28.381
count me out.

33:29.882 --> 33:30.883
All right.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.433
[vomiting]

33:41.477 --> 33:42.895
[gasping]

33:43.688 --> 33:44.814
[spits]

33:48.026 --> 33:49.777
[toilet flushing]

33:51.654 --> 33:52.864
[groaning]

34:07.587 --> 34:09.547
Time to check the prisoner. Chip me in.

34:12.091 --> 34:14.093
Brakeman's business. You know the drill.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.273
[Josie trembling]

34:37.492 --> 34:38.993
Jesus Christ.

34:42.747 --> 34:46.000
-Till?
-Yeah? Yeah, what can I do?

34:52.465 --> 34:54.550
What's your first name?

35:01.432 --> 35:02.475
Bess.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.522
Nothing you can do, Bess. She'll be back.

35:08.564 --> 35:13.152
It's okay. I didn't tell her anything.
She doesn't know you're one of us.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.116
I'm one of you?

35:19.742 --> 35:20.868
You have to be.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.622
I'm still a Brakeman, Josie.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.126
What I did for you and Layton,
I just did it because it wasn't right.

35:28.209 --> 35:32.296
-That's the only reason you need.
-I still have a duty to this train.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.340
We have a duty to each other.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.136
And to the workers.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.138
And to the weakest among us.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.766
There's no future without it, Bess.

35:48.896 --> 35:51.858
You just have to decide
what's right and wrong.

35:53.985 --> 35:57.029
It doesn't matter
what the consequences are for you.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.703
I don't know how to help you. It's...

36:03.786 --> 36:07.206
There's Jackboots on the other side,
and I don't have keys to your cuffs.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.542
-Get a message to Layton.
-Okay.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.169
He's hiding with Miss Audrey.

36:12.253 --> 36:16.299
You tell him that Zarah betrayed us,
but that I made contact with Miles.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.050
He's ready.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.054
-Okay. I promise.
-You promise?

36:22.138 --> 36:26.142
I promise. I will... okay?

36:30.897 --> 36:31.898
All right.

36:34.066 --> 36:34.901
Bess?

36:42.575 --> 36:44.577
There's one more thing I need you to do.

36:48.998 --> 36:52.376
[Ruth] Melanie, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.753
Now is not a good time, Ruth.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.088
There's a major problem
brewing in First Class.

36:56.172 --> 37:00.551
Ruth, whatever it is,
it needs to wait, okay?

37:00.635 --> 37:03.512
-You don't understand. It's the Folgers--
-[Melanie] I don't care.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.891
Do you understand? I don't give a shit

37:06.974 --> 37:09.769
if the Folgers have another complaint
about their goddamn steak.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.146
There's none left.
Just tell them that, okay?

37:12.230 --> 37:15.233
This isn't a bed and breakfast.
This is the last remnants of humanity.

37:15.316 --> 37:19.028
So whatever it is, I have real problems.
Just do your job and fix it!

37:22.740 --> 37:26.035
Well, of course, Melanie.
Whatever you say.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.038
I...

37:30.748 --> 37:31.666
Thank you.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.531
[Josie trembling]

38:16.252 --> 38:17.420
[sighs]

38:19.088 --> 38:21.299
I don't want to continue this, Josie.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.803
You have a choice.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.098
It's Layton or Miles.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.107
Your hand...

38:40.735 --> 38:41.736
What happened to it?

38:51.620 --> 38:52.538
Guard!

38:53.122 --> 38:54.081
[Josie grunts]

38:56.125 --> 38:57.251
[imperceptible]

38:59.253 --> 39:00.421
Guard!

39:01.088 --> 39:02.631
[both grunting]

39:12.600 --> 39:13.642
[Melanie grunting]

39:43.756 --> 39:45.257
[Melanie shouts]

39:51.847 --> 39:53.391
[gasping]

39:57.228 --> 39:58.479
[Melanie panting]

40:10.449 --> 40:11.450
[Grey] Melanie!

40:16.831 --> 40:18.082
What happened?

40:18.165 --> 40:20.626
Why did you conduct
an interrogation without me?

40:22.294 --> 40:23.587
Take her to Compost.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.507
We're done here.

40:40.354 --> 40:41.355
[Till] Layton...

40:46.652 --> 40:47.486
Josie.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.875
Hello, Miles.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.754
-I heard you had a rough day.
-[Bennett] This guy's a trooper.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.385
Finished his exercises,
said goodbye to his friends.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.307
And no one interfered.

41:23.814 --> 41:24.690
[chuckles softly]

41:26.525 --> 41:30.988
You know, once you pass through that door,
there's no turning back.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.034
You'll be an engineer.

41:37.244 --> 41:43.501
But to be an engineer on <i>Snowpiercer,</i>
you have to make sacrifices.

41:45.586 --> 41:48.297
And that can be hard.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.051
Are you happy as an engineer?

42:00.976 --> 42:04.188
The needs of the train are more important
than our own happiness.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.319
We're engineers.

42:12.029 --> 42:13.697
We keep the world alive.

You.

About how much
you like dirty little secrets.
