00:05.430 --> 00:08.833
Ugh! This fry
is still frozen in the middle.

00:08.933 --> 00:11.670
Whoa, curly fries again?

00:11.770 --> 00:13.438
Th... Those are a dollar more.

00:13.538 --> 00:15.274
How do you guys afford them every day?

00:15.374 --> 00:17.209
Babysitting, dingus!

00:17.309 --> 00:19.144
You're all babysitting now?

00:19.244 --> 00:20.612
How come I didn't hear about this?

00:20.712 --> 00:22.381
Our apologies.

00:22.481 --> 00:25.384
We must have been talking
about it in the curly fry line.

00:30.589 --> 00:33.292
Why are curly fries
more expensive anyway?

00:33.392 --> 00:37.496
'Cause you get so much more fry.

00:37.596 --> 00:40.232
And I'm not out of potato, Steve.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.500
I'm out of arm.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.702
Billy, come here!

00:43.802 --> 00:47.071
Hello, fellow babysitters.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.473
Him, too?

00:48.573 --> 00:51.343
Let's show Steve what this fry can do.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.378
Oh, hell yeah.

00:53.478 --> 00:56.415
Let's blow this tater hater's mind.

01:03.154 --> 01:05.590
I've reached the door.

01:06.465 --> 01:08.227
I'm going off campus.

01:09.628 --> 01:12.431
I'm getting on the bus to Chimdale.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.732
Wow, I'm sold.

01:13.832 --> 01:15.600
The curly fries, the babysitting,

01:15.700 --> 01:16.868
the whole damn thing.

01:16.968 --> 01:18.102
Wrap it up, I'll take it.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.739
Do my eyes deceive me?

01:20.839 --> 01:22.006
Billy?

01:22.106 --> 01:24.443
Oh, the wonders I've seen.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.745
Crossed the Sahara on foot,

01:26.845 --> 01:29.047
made love to an Eskimo,

01:29.147 --> 01:31.082
had a spicy soup.

01:31.182 --> 01:33.785
I lived a full, rich life.

01:33.885 --> 01:37.289
And the fry never touched the ground.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.891
Not even on my wedding night.

01:39.991 --> 01:44.396
Or the day I buried my son, Mitsuhiro.

01:44.496 --> 01:47.031
But here's your fry.

01:53.171 --> 01:58.277
I lost my flip-flops
over the Indian Ocean.

01:58.377 --> 02:00.612
Not your red Havaianas!

02:00.712 --> 02:04.483
It was the red Havaianas.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.721
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

02:09.821 --> 02:13.492

02:31.142 --> 02:34.479
♪ Good morning, U.S.A. ♪

02:38.037 --> 02:40.585
Listen up, because
I'm only going to say this once.

02:40.685 --> 02:42.020
I have an interest.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.688
Oh, that's great, honey!

02:43.788 --> 02:45.924
Oh, phew. I thought you guys
would think I was weird.

02:46.024 --> 02:49.928
The CIA has an Exotic Food Club,
and I gotsta get in!

02:50.028 --> 02:52.163
This club eats crazy stuff and...

02:52.263 --> 02:55.033
Stop right there... I gotta hear more!

02:55.133 --> 02:56.868
Well, in order to gain membership,

02:56.968 --> 02:59.538
I must present an exotic
food to the committee.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.340
You probably won't see me for a while.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.676
'Cause if I get in, I'm going to
Mexico by myself to celebrate.

03:05.816 --> 03:08.347
Looks like you and Jeff have
the house to yourself tonight,

03:08.447 --> 03:09.848
'cause I have Moms Club.

03:14.085 --> 03:17.456
Was that "opportunity"
I just heard a-knocking?

03:18.186 --> 03:20.825
Maybe you can spread
the word at Moms Club,

03:20.925 --> 03:23.562
I'm getting into the babysitting game.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.630
No, absolutely not.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.499
You're not ready to babysit.

03:27.599 --> 03:30.669
Wait, what? All my friends
are babysitting, why can't I?

03:30.769 --> 03:33.171
You still have me take
your temperature rectally.

03:33.271 --> 03:34.806
Yeah, it's more accurate.

03:34.906 --> 03:37.576
You panic easily, you're neurotic,

03:37.676 --> 03:39.378
you're afraid of your own shadow...

03:39.478 --> 03:40.845
Ha-ha, what?

03:40.945 --> 03:43.047
M-Me and my shadow are totally cool now.

03:43.147 --> 03:44.416
Ah!

03:44.516 --> 03:48.653
Please, Mom, this means a lot to me.

03:48.753 --> 03:50.689
Tell you what...

03:50.789 --> 03:53.658
If you can tell me which
hand the strawberry's in,

03:53.758 --> 03:56.395
you're ready.

03:57.368 --> 03:59.864
I knew you weren't ready.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.004
Whoa!

04:08.306 --> 04:10.542
That's how you babysit.

04:10.642 --> 04:12.844
Whoa, a strawberry gun.

04:12.944 --> 04:14.541
No, Jeff! Don't!

04:18.731 --> 04:20.165
Thanks for your business, Leo.

04:20.265 --> 04:22.201
We'll get you there next time, buddy.

04:22.301 --> 04:24.303
I knew Leo wasn't going to orgasm.

04:24.403 --> 04:25.905
In fact, I made sure of it.

04:26.005 --> 04:28.473
He doesn't know,
but I've been working against him.

04:28.573 --> 04:30.642
Leo's got it easy compared to me.

04:30.743 --> 04:32.144
Mom won't let me babysit.

04:32.244 --> 04:33.412
She keeps treating me like

04:33.512 --> 04:34.914
I'm still some helpless, little child.

04:35.014 --> 04:36.548
Kids are no joke.

04:36.648 --> 04:38.884
I learned that the hard
way after Rogu was born.

04:38.984 --> 04:40.152
You remember Rogu...

04:40.252 --> 04:42.587
Rogu? Maybe? Rogu? My baby!

04:42.688 --> 04:44.556
Probably heard the rumor
that he used to be my tumor.

04:44.656 --> 04:47.426
He's Rogu, my baby... he's here!

04:47.526 --> 04:49.895
Anyway, that little rhyme's
how I remember who he is.

04:49.995 --> 04:52.564
Do you keep Rogu in
the room while you...?

04:52.664 --> 04:55.000
Punch aluminum-siding
salesmen in the balls?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.036
Yes, Steve. But I always put Rogu

04:57.136 --> 04:59.839
in the bath with his favorite music.
Hey, buddy!

04:59.939 --> 05:03.909
♪ The itsy bitsy Rogu was
wearing his headphones ♪

05:04.009 --> 05:07.713
♪ Because his dad was
giving a rusty trombone... ♪

05:07.813 --> 05:10.015
This way,
he has no idea what's going on.

05:10.115 --> 05:13.753
Rogu is Daddy!

05:13.853 --> 05:15.587
Yeah...

05:15.687 --> 05:18.623
maybe I should do my
dates outside the house.

05:18.724 --> 05:21.526
I know! How about
you watch Rogu while I'm out,

05:21.626 --> 05:23.028
and afterwards, I'll tell Francine

05:23.128 --> 05:24.296
what a great job you did.

05:24.396 --> 05:25.697
She'll have to admit you're ready.

05:25.798 --> 05:27.132
That's perfect!

05:27.232 --> 05:29.134
I-I can start tonight
while she's at her club.

05:29.234 --> 05:32.471
Car go through tunnel.

05:32.571 --> 05:35.407
Aww. I taught him that.

05:37.676 --> 05:39.578
If he gets cranky,
just rock him to sleep.

05:39.678 --> 05:41.781
Sleep fixes everything.

05:43.648 --> 05:45.584
- Anything else?
- Three important rules.

05:45.684 --> 05:48.821
Absolutely no candy, no screen time,

05:48.921 --> 05:50.823
and don't let him look at my ant farm.

05:50.923 --> 05:52.124
He didn't want to chip in for it,

05:52.224 --> 05:54.126
so he doesn't get to enjoy it.

05:55.727 --> 05:57.162
I'm off to Moms Club.

05:57.262 --> 05:58.764
We're going to the Sharks game.

05:58.864 --> 06:00.399
Gettin' there early.

06:00.499 --> 06:03.402
I heard they got a new
Port-A-Potty outside gate J,

06:03.502 --> 06:06.471
and I'd really like to
break that thing in.

06:12.845 --> 06:14.479
Now it's just you and me.

06:14.579 --> 06:16.081
Should I order us some Domino's?

06:16.181 --> 06:19.952
Rogu no do chain restaurants.

06:20.052 --> 06:24.023
- Seriously?
- Ha-ha, Rogu joke.

06:24.123 --> 06:27.192
Rogu eat from trash can.

06:29.795 --> 06:31.630
Stan, we're thrilled you're interested

06:31.730 --> 06:33.432
in the CIA's Exotic Food Club.

06:33.532 --> 06:36.435
But maybe we weren't clear
on what our objective is.

06:37.942 --> 06:41.306
For example, when my boy Wolfgang
auditioned for our club,

06:41.406 --> 06:43.843
he brought in deep-fried pigeon feet.

06:43.943 --> 06:45.344
Wait, that's Wolfgang?

06:45.444 --> 06:46.812
I assumed you were Wolfgang.

06:46.912 --> 06:48.113
No, I'm Dale.

06:48.213 --> 06:50.115
Oh, then who's Vorasmus?

06:50.215 --> 06:52.184
She's sick. Anyway, Stan,

06:52.284 --> 06:56.221
you've brought in what appears
to be gas station coffee cake.

06:56.321 --> 06:57.722
It's Entenmann's!

06:57.823 --> 06:59.358
You're not getting it.

06:59.458 --> 07:02.394
We told you to bring something exotic.

07:02.494 --> 07:04.729
Oh, I thought you said "quixotic."

07:04.830 --> 07:09.334
So you feel...
that the Entenmann's is quixotic?

07:09.434 --> 07:12.004
Yeah, I was banking on no
one knowing what that meant.

07:12.104 --> 07:13.238
Why don't I just try again?

07:13.338 --> 07:16.241
Stan, leave the Entenmann's.

07:19.516 --> 07:21.914
Do you want more, Rogu?

07:22.014 --> 07:23.582
This means more.

07:23.682 --> 07:25.918
Hey, Helen Keller. Keep it down.

07:26.018 --> 07:28.587
Me and my fellow code-monkeys
are mining for Bitcoins.

07:28.687 --> 07:31.490
I got so many. I'm gonna be so rich.

07:31.590 --> 07:33.358
You're just writing "Bitcoin"

07:33.458 --> 07:34.759
over and over in a Word document.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.195
Okay, man,

07:36.295 --> 07:38.830
one of us is drowning in cryptocurrency,

07:38.931 --> 07:41.333
and one of us is being
paid five bucks an hour

07:41.433 --> 07:43.535
to watch a farting tumor.

07:43.635 --> 07:45.370
Actually, I'm babysitting Rogu for free

07:45.470 --> 07:46.771
to prove to Mom I'm ready...

07:46.872 --> 07:49.441
Oh, my God.
I didn't ask for your life story.

07:49.541 --> 07:51.376
Unless you'd be willing to sell it.

07:51.476 --> 07:54.880
How does... three Bitcoins sound?

07:54.980 --> 07:57.682
This is a restraining order against you

07:57.782 --> 08:00.685
- from that girl who...
- Oh, man. I got hacked!

08:03.022 --> 08:05.524
Unh-unh. Roger said no candy.

08:11.196 --> 08:12.898
Okay.

08:12.998 --> 08:17.102
But promise to tell Roger how
good of a babysitter I was.

08:21.706 --> 08:23.275
Rogu! Rogu!

08:28.047 --> 08:29.949
What the...

08:31.917 --> 08:35.720
Oh, no! That's why no candy?!

08:38.157 --> 08:39.558
What the hell?!

08:39.658 --> 08:40.825
I don't know why you're shocked, man.

08:40.926 --> 08:43.428
Rogu's crazy. He does crazy shit.

08:47.037 --> 08:48.771
When Roger said not to feed them candy,

08:48.871 --> 08:50.473
I didn't think they'd multiply!

08:50.573 --> 08:53.276
I think I know one way
we can fix this problem.

08:53.376 --> 08:54.911
Really? What?

08:55.011 --> 08:56.612
Are you sure you want to hear about it?

08:56.712 --> 08:58.081
Because you've gotten mad

08:58.181 --> 08:59.815
when I've tried to discuss this before.

08:59.916 --> 09:02.752
Oh, my God. I'm not going to
that church with you, Klaus.

09:02.852 --> 09:05.288
It's a cool church, Steve.

09:05.388 --> 09:06.923
The preacher wears jeans.

09:07.023 --> 09:08.424
There's a rock band.

09:08.524 --> 09:11.127
The preacher's wife
is a graphic designer.

09:11.227 --> 09:13.496
Do you get the picture I'm painting?

09:13.596 --> 09:15.165
I-I'll just call Roger.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.167
He'll know how to defuse this.

09:19.102 --> 09:22.605
See! I do have a girlfriend!

09:22.705 --> 09:26.276
All those candles I bought
were for someone who exists!

09:26.376 --> 09:29.779
So who's the liar now, Brad?!

09:29.879 --> 09:31.814
Damn it, straight to voicemail.

09:32.442 --> 09:33.616
Just call your mom.

09:33.716 --> 09:36.852
She can't know I'm babysitting,
much less screwing it up.

09:36.953 --> 09:38.454
Where did he get that candy?

09:39.522 --> 09:42.525
I keep loose gummy worms
under the couch cushions.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.926
What? Wait!

09:48.631 --> 09:51.001
Aaah!

09:51.101 --> 09:55.538
Should we just call
Terminix and call it a day?

09:57.000 --> 10:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:04.380 --> 10:06.216
Klaus, we... we got to do something.

10:06.316 --> 10:07.617
I already did.

10:07.717 --> 10:10.520
I gave the shy Rogu a bottle to spin.

10:13.556 --> 10:14.824
- Oooooh.
- Oooooh.

10:18.294 --> 10:20.830
Rogu have errand to run.

10:20.930 --> 10:23.533
Oh, no!

10:23.633 --> 10:25.668
Back inside, Rogu.

10:25.768 --> 10:29.539
But Rogu have score to settle.

10:31.641 --> 10:33.009
They're all gone.

10:33.109 --> 10:34.477
They did it.

10:34.577 --> 10:38.214
They finally moved to big city.

10:38.314 --> 10:39.982
♪ I have tons of boys ♪

10:40.083 --> 10:42.918
Whoa. How did you get them to calm down?

10:43.019 --> 10:46.156
No thang, I just threw on
some random YouTube video.

10:46.256 --> 10:48.591
First of all, Roger said no screen time!

10:48.691 --> 10:51.194
And second, this is not random.
This is your song.

10:51.294 --> 10:54.197
Steve, this song
belongs to the world now.

10:54.297 --> 10:56.357
You saw what happened
when they ate candy.

10:56.367 --> 10:59.535
God knows what your janky-ass
video will do to them.

10:59.635 --> 11:02.338
Janky-ass?
Not according to the comments.

11:02.438 --> 11:05.541
Listen. VapePimp77 refers to it as...

11:05.641 --> 11:09.412
"I make $200 a day working from home."

11:09.512 --> 11:13.283
Oh. My. God.

11:13.383 --> 11:16.018
Yeah, that's pretty big
coming from VapePimp.

11:16.119 --> 11:17.520
He's growing!

11:17.620 --> 11:19.355
W-We got to get him outside!

11:19.455 --> 11:20.623
Come on, Rogu.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.058
You want screen time?

me smoke a cigar before?

You're in for a treat.

Ugh. "Where were you when

16:10.770 --> 16:13.139
I was in the parking
lot with two nutsacks.

I'm sorry, Mom. I really messed up.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.714

The CIA, huh?

16:26.019 --> 16:29.255
Lucky for you, I slap uglies
with a guy who works there.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.357
Ugh, can't you call it making love?

16:31.457 --> 16:32.658
And can't you just call him Dad?

16:32.758 --> 16:34.694
I'm on the phone!

16:37.297 --> 16:39.565
I can see the glint of the oyster can.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.567
You sure you don't want something else?

16:41.667 --> 16:44.004
Wait, actually,
do you have that prehistoric fish,

16:44.104 --> 16:46.539
the whatchamacallit, the...
the coelacanth?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.774
- Unfortunately, no.
- Did you check in the back?

16:48.875 --> 16:51.377
- No, I never left.
- Then it's hole time, baby.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.951
He's not answering.

16:54.015 --> 16:57.117
Well, that's the risk you
take when you use a phone.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.419
I'm out.

17:00.495 --> 17:02.088
Don't worry, Steve.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.458
You forget that I'm here with...
Moms Club.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.193
Leave it to us.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.794
But you said the same thing

17:08.895 --> 17:11.364
when I found that lump behind my ear...

17:11.464 --> 17:13.433
and it just keeps getting bigger.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.268
Moms Club will get to it.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.562
Rogu, are you in here?

17:44.664 --> 17:45.932
Cool.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.300
Check it out.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.568
I'm Doctor Fart Face,

17:48.668 --> 17:50.503

17:50.603 --> 17:52.405

17:52.505 --> 17:54.507

Fart Face sounds like.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.610
Uh-oh. Steve's clearly
lost his funny bone.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.980
We need to revive it. Boop!

18:06.001 --> 18:07.120
Where's Rogu?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.622
- D-Did you hurt him?
- It's hard to say.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.857
You see, we jammed him
through a sausage grinder

18:11.958 --> 18:13.926
and microwaved him on
the popcorn setting.

18:14.027 --> 18:15.161
Mwah!

18:15.261 --> 18:17.597
You ate him?! Why?!

18:17.697 --> 18:20.166
Because we're the Exotic Food Club.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.302
And there's nothing more exotic

18:22.402 --> 18:25.271
than that little mutant of yours.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.676
I can't believe he's gone.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.114
I-I just... I just wish
I could have done more.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.552
More! Rogu's still alive!

18:39.652 --> 18:41.621

Look, Steve, when I said
you weren't ready to babysit,

19:35.007 --> 19:39.079
I guess I meant I wasn't
ready for you to babysit.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.713
What?

19:40.813 --> 19:44.550
See, once you're old enough
to take care of kids,

19:44.650 --> 19:47.420
it means you don't need
me to take care of you.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.457

I'll make you a deal.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.765

19:59.865 --> 20:02.302
and I'm losing control of my bowels,

20:02.402 --> 20:07.207
