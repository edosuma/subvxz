00:24.625 --> 00:27.561
<i>Since the 1960s,
the port city of Montreal</i>

00:27.628 --> 00:29.729
<i>has been one of
the largest points of import</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:32.116
<i>for coke and heroin in the world.</i>

00:32.433 --> 00:35.902
<i>If you lived in New York,
or Boston, or Philly,</i>

00:35.970 --> 00:38.071
<i>anywhere in the northeast
of America really,</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:40.841
<i>and did drugs, they
came through Montreal.</i>

00:41.523 --> 00:43.210
<i>And with all that money on the table,</i>

00:43.211 --> 00:44.843
<i>everyone wanted their cut.</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:47.218
<i>So for decades, the city was at war.</i>

00:48.118 --> 00:49.953
<i>The Irish, they owned the docks,</i>

00:49.978 --> 00:52.046
<i>Haitians, well, they ran
street level operations,</i>

00:52.547 --> 00:54.314
<i>the Bikers controlled distribution,</i>

00:54.679 --> 00:56.742
<i>but they had nothing without the Mafia.</i>

00:56.951 --> 00:59.086
<i>The Mafia had those
international contacts</i>

00:59.153 --> 01:00.520
<i>to import the product.</i>

01:00.588 --> 01:03.054
<i>And in addition
to extortion and racketeering,</i>

01:03.079 --> 01:05.828
<i>they controlled the city's
construction industry as well.</i>

01:05.878 --> 01:08.437
<i>Nothing got built without their okay.</i>

01:09.263 --> 01:11.398
<i>But in the '90s, everything changed</i>

01:11.466 --> 01:14.726
<i>when Vito Rizzuto took over
from his father as mob boss.</i>

01:15.216 --> 01:17.851
<i>Vito was old school,
but he also had vision.</i>

01:18.024 --> 01:19.425
<i>He saw a different kind of future</i>

01:19.450 --> 01:21.625
<i>for his business and the city.</i>

01:28.937 --> 01:33.265
<i>And there was me, by his side
for the whole wild ride.</i>

01:33.699 --> 01:37.179
My old man put together
the bidding for that beast.

01:37.672 --> 01:39.606
Everybody shared in the bonuses,

01:39.674 --> 01:41.140
the kickbacks, the graft...

01:41.442 --> 01:42.953
It was supposed
to cost three million dollars,

01:42.977 --> 01:44.414
ended up costing a billion.

01:44.745 --> 01:47.101
Everybody should be so
lucky to get an Olympics.

01:47.195 --> 01:49.382
There he is, man of the hour.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.850
Hey! They all behavin' themselves?

01:50.918 --> 01:52.819
No one shot anyone yet,
so that's a good start.

01:52.887 --> 01:53.906
It's good.

01:53.931 --> 01:56.179
Everyone! Everyone!

01:56.757 --> 01:59.125
I know you're all interested
to hear what Vito has to say,

01:59.193 --> 02:00.710
so I'm gonna let him get to it.

02:01.466 --> 02:02.554
Gentlemen!

02:03.064 --> 02:04.828
We are all at war.

02:05.466 --> 02:07.562
Jacques, you and I still do
some business, but

02:07.768 --> 02:10.002
you still try to get
my action on the east end.

02:10.071 --> 02:12.172
Papa Lou, you and the Irish,

02:12.270 --> 02:13.906
been spilling blood for a year.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.890
This is our city.

02:17.411 --> 02:20.578
We got to acknowledge
that nobody is going anywhere.

02:20.992 --> 02:22.582
All right, so, question is,

02:22.650 --> 02:25.078
do you wanna keep fighting
over street corners,

02:25.228 --> 02:27.265
or do you want a piece
of all the action?

02:28.789 --> 02:31.703
Now, what I'm proposing
is a cooperative.

02:33.127 --> 02:35.779
You're all here for a specific reason,

02:35.804 --> 02:38.500
'cause of what you bring to the table.

02:39.501 --> 02:42.242
But we gotta conduct this
like a business.

02:43.406 --> 02:44.873
You all get a say,

02:45.973 --> 02:47.774
but there can only be one CEO.

02:48.709 --> 02:50.110
I suppose that's you?

02:50.177 --> 02:51.411
Yeah.

02:51.479 --> 02:54.280
Because I own something
that none of you do.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.500
City Hall and the cops.

02:57.724 --> 02:59.210
But I'm willing to share.

03:01.455 --> 03:02.756
Keep talking.

03:02.823 --> 03:06.960
Look, there's enough coke,
hash, hookers, gambling

03:07.027 --> 03:10.897
for all of us to make a lot
of money if we work together.

03:12.099 --> 03:13.492
But if we don't,

03:14.273 --> 03:16.967
we're gonna end up in prison or dead.

03:18.205 --> 03:20.781
So here's what I propose,
you all go home.

03:21.142 --> 03:22.275
You relax.

03:22.343 --> 03:23.656
You drink a beer

03:23.878 --> 03:26.015
and you think about your bright future.

03:26.689 --> 03:27.789
What do you say?

03:29.417 --> 03:32.919
<i>And so began one of
the greatest runs ever.</i>

03:32.987 --> 03:35.855
<i>What we did should be studied
in history books.</i>

03:35.923 --> 03:37.398
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

03:37.558 --> 03:39.392
<i>We brought peace between people</i>

03:39.460 --> 03:42.195
<i>who would never have walked
down the same block together.</i>

03:42.263 --> 03:43.496
<i>Like ever.</i>

03:43.564 --> 03:45.765
<i>Between the gang syndicate we created,</i>

03:45.833 --> 03:49.250
<i>and the politicians
and the cops in our pockets,</i>

03:49.516 --> 03:50.960
<i>we were unstoppable.</i>

03:51.050 --> 03:53.752
<i>Life was good.
Life was good for everyone.</i>

03:54.008 --> 03:56.531
<i>But if there's one thing
you can ever count on,</i>

03:56.750 --> 03:59.345
<i>it's that gangsters
are greedy, petty asses,</i>

03:59.679 --> 04:03.226
<i>and will always screw things up.</i>

05:13.422 --> 05:14.585
Hey!

05:15.057 --> 05:16.791
Where are the takeout menus?

05:16.859 --> 05:17.914
By the sofa.

05:18.394 --> 05:20.210
The kitchen wasn't working for you?

05:20.563 --> 05:21.563
No.

05:21.804 --> 05:23.909
Usually when we order in,
we're laying on the sofa

05:23.933 --> 05:25.875
'cause we're too lazy to cook. Right?

05:25.972 --> 05:28.013
So, instead of going to
the kitchen to get the menus,

05:28.037 --> 05:29.351
I put them by the sofa.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.005
Streamlined the whole thing.

05:31.073 --> 05:33.541
You streamlined
our takeout operations?

05:33.609 --> 05:36.021
Yeah, must've shaved like two,
three seconds off the whole thing.

05:36.045 --> 05:38.148
Wow. I'm impressed.

05:38.429 --> 05:40.915
Aren't you feeling bad that
I'm gonna be home, alone,

05:40.983 --> 05:43.384
while you're out at some party?

05:43.452 --> 05:44.452
No.

05:45.675 --> 05:46.675
Bastard.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.757
But you do look very handsome.

05:49.825 --> 05:51.226
Why, thank you.

05:53.262 --> 05:54.390
Come here.

05:59.964 --> 06:01.632
Okay. Now you gotta go.

06:01.738 --> 06:04.439
- I want my egg rolls.
- Okay.

06:08.477 --> 06:09.878
Bring me back some cake.

06:11.747 --> 06:12.843
Bye, Michelle.

06:28.163 --> 06:29.697
Happy birthday!

06:31.867 --> 06:33.167
Everybody get here, come on.

06:33.235 --> 06:34.513
Come on, Papa. Would
you be in the picture?

06:34.537 --> 06:36.571
No, I don't wanna use
my new camera.

06:36.639 --> 06:38.183
- How long is this gonna take?
- About a year.

06:38.207 --> 06:40.375
Okay. Did anything happen?

06:44.647 --> 06:46.347
Who wants some cake?
Who wants some cake?

06:46.415 --> 06:47.749
Come on!

06:47.816 --> 06:49.317
Who wants some cake? Come on.

06:49.385 --> 06:50.618
Here's what you do...

06:50.686 --> 06:52.206
It doesn't sound very reassuring.

07:12.335 --> 07:13.632
Vito Rizzuto.

07:23.579 --> 07:24.773
Nicolo.

07:27.456 --> 07:30.890
- The yard looks good, you know.
- He does a good job.

07:31.627 --> 07:33.561
Did you take care
of that thing with Pierre?

07:33.629 --> 07:35.563
Yeah. It's just a misunderstanding.

07:35.631 --> 07:37.665
We got a new guy
in the zoning department

07:37.733 --> 07:39.667
so I sent Declan down
so we can run the ropes.

07:39.735 --> 07:41.669
I know. I'll tell him!

07:41.737 --> 07:42.737
<i>Beddu!</i>

07:42.805 --> 07:44.172
My God.

07:44.239 --> 07:45.992
And Nico Junior.

07:46.408 --> 07:48.382
We got the allstar team tonight.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.845
Three generations of Rizzutos.

07:51.413 --> 07:52.580
New shoes?

07:52.648 --> 07:54.048
- Yeah, you like these?
- Yeah.

07:54.116 --> 07:55.917
Got 'em yesterday. I like the stitching.

07:55.985 --> 07:57.151
Yeah. Nice.

07:59.355 --> 08:00.497
You know, you don't gotta

08:00.509 --> 08:01.766
stop talking when I enter the room.

08:01.790 --> 08:03.524
Yeah, we do.

08:03.592 --> 08:05.103
I know more about
your business than you think.

08:05.127 --> 08:07.105
You know, you need to
concentrate on your business.

08:07.129 --> 08:08.773
Yeah. Real estate development
doesn't exactly move

08:08.797 --> 08:09.797
at the speed of light.

08:12.835 --> 08:14.168
Did you see the cake?

08:14.236 --> 08:16.104
- Yeah.
<i>- Madonna mia!</i>

08:31.820 --> 08:33.331
That's not a cake,
it's a monument.

08:33.355 --> 08:34.589
That's no dessert.

08:35.724 --> 08:36.804
Know what it cost?

08:42.592 --> 08:43.659
There he is.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.593
Should we check that out?

08:53.876 --> 08:56.310
Captain said strictly surveillance.

08:58.047 --> 09:00.348
If they want more,
they can pay me double time.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.588
- Where's Declan?
- He's coming.

09:10.492 --> 09:11.636
What do you wanna do
on your birthday?

09:11.660 --> 09:12.694
An ice cream cone?

09:12.761 --> 09:13.961
Who?

09:14.029 --> 09:15.269
Come on, guys, let's go inside.

09:15.297 --> 09:16.330
Let's get busy.

09:16.734 --> 09:17.734
Okay.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.214
Let's do it.

09:29.078 --> 09:30.437
God damn it.

09:40.155 --> 09:41.422
Nice to be rich.

09:41.490 --> 09:44.158
You just park your car
in this neighborhood

09:44.226 --> 09:46.060
and local cops are right there.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.000
You girls making out in there?

09:53.068 --> 09:54.414
We've received some complaints.

09:54.439 --> 09:55.799
You're gonna have to come with us.

10:02.244 --> 10:04.062
You got business in Cartierville?

10:04.279 --> 10:06.210
Yeah. I'm in the market.

10:06.682 --> 10:09.250
What do you get all
those rifles and scopes for?

10:09.485 --> 10:11.819
Protection from sexual
predators like yourselves.

10:11.887 --> 10:13.398
Hey, watch your mouth.

10:13.922 --> 10:16.624
Might wanna check in with your
sergeant before you,

10:16.692 --> 10:19.656
make any decision that
could end your career, pig.

10:25.179 --> 10:26.900
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

10:26.935 --> 10:28.536
What it means is we're protected.

10:28.604 --> 10:31.132
The Devil's Kings have a deal
with the police.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.624
Call it in.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.398
Sergeant Ramsey. Station 19.

10:37.212 --> 10:39.347
I don't know. What do you think?
You wanna call it in?

10:40.649 --> 10:41.883
Just do it.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.818
I wanna get home. I gotta take a shit.

10:45.372 --> 10:46.506
Hang on.

10:48.457 --> 10:49.724
What's the name?

10:51.827 --> 10:54.320
What name
am I giving the sergeant?

10:54.797 --> 10:56.631
Just tell him we work for Rejean.

10:57.499 --> 10:58.533
Rejean.

11:01.436 --> 11:02.500
Hey!

11:03.105 --> 11:04.257
Yes, it is.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.859
Yeah, pass me through to Ramsey.

11:09.998 --> 11:11.085
What's up?

11:11.947 --> 11:13.054
I'm good.

11:13.415 --> 11:14.648
But listen, hey,

11:14.950 --> 11:17.031
we got a couple of bikers in the back.

11:17.486 --> 11:19.126
They said to tell you that
they're working

11:19.154 --> 11:20.703
for a guy called Rejean?

11:24.960 --> 11:25.960
Really?

11:28.071 --> 11:29.371
Okay.

11:30.432 --> 11:33.201
Per... Yeah. All right, later.

11:34.937 --> 11:36.237
Well?

11:37.306 --> 11:38.796
My apologies, girls.

11:39.608 --> 11:41.226
What a waste of time.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.893
You wanna get out here?

11:43.212 --> 11:45.079
Take us back to our goddamn car.

11:45.248 --> 11:46.348
Sure.

12:02.664 --> 12:04.065
Hey, come on. Move.

12:04.887 --> 12:05.887
Let's go.

12:09.806 --> 12:10.806
Sit.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.992
- What the hell is this?
- You're free to go.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.348
Told you to take us back
to our car, assholes.

12:20.415 --> 12:21.815
I can't remember where they parked.

12:21.850 --> 12:23.094
Do you remember where they parked? No.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.703
- And our guns?
- File a report.

12:25.757 --> 12:27.890
- Beat it.
- Let's go.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.062
They came in
to my house, Gilles.

13:36.676 --> 13:40.212
These two punk nobodies,
they came to my home.

13:40.272 --> 13:41.773
My whole family was in.

13:42.539 --> 13:43.672
I understand.

13:46.653 --> 13:49.023
We had eight months
without any dead bodies.

13:49.884 --> 13:51.390
You don't have to tell me.

13:52.009 --> 13:53.843
I'm the one who had
to put the muzzle on 'em.

13:56.634 --> 13:58.301
Brass hit the roof, Vito.

14:00.585 --> 14:01.971
Who's Sergeant Ramsey?

14:03.995 --> 14:05.329
I took care of it

14:05.476 --> 14:07.377
and he's been transferred to CoteNord.

14:08.571 --> 14:09.984
Should've put a bullet in him.

14:10.427 --> 14:11.761
Better than living there.

14:13.273 --> 14:15.585
What about this, Rejean?

14:16.122 --> 14:17.375
He's taken care of.

14:18.818 --> 14:21.078
- I don't want things to escalate.
- They won't.

14:38.676 --> 14:40.877
So, Rejean!

14:41.788 --> 14:42.960
Rejean!

14:42.985 --> 14:44.946
How do you wanna proceed?
You know how this works.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.210
Bruno.

14:48.440 --> 14:50.219
Bruno, did you see that?
See what he just did?

14:50.243 --> 14:51.593
That was disgusting, yeah.

14:51.618 --> 14:52.671
On my shoe.

14:52.923 --> 14:53.960
Sorry about that.

14:54.211 --> 14:55.523
Bruno's a class act.

14:55.859 --> 14:57.000
He's a real class act.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.726
This kind of stuff makes him queasy.

14:58.963 --> 15:02.332
So, Rejean, who gave you the order?

15:06.312 --> 15:07.637
Why should I tell you?

15:08.739 --> 15:10.382
Because it's my job to ask.

15:11.026 --> 15:13.875
Declan, come on, we've already
got two bodies on this thing.

15:14.411 --> 15:16.245
And Vito would prefer
to avoid adding another

15:16.313 --> 15:17.335
to the pile. Come on.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.796
Rejean, do you know Bruno?

15:18.851 --> 15:20.418
Do you know what his nickname is?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.859
"The Peacemaker."

15:23.117 --> 15:24.921
That's pretty selfexplanatory,

15:24.989 --> 15:26.320
even to an idiot like you.

15:26.788 --> 15:28.155
You know what he'd like to do?

15:28.180 --> 15:29.671
Bring you a cappuccino.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.179
He'd like to bring you
a nice soft rag and...

15:32.484 --> 15:35.367
wipe that blood off your
face, 'cause he hates blood.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.015
It's true.

15:37.836 --> 15:41.742
Rejean, I'm going to
ask you one more time.

15:42.707 --> 15:46.039
Who gave you the order?
And don't say Jacques.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.245
I know it wasn't Jacques. This is you,

15:48.313 --> 15:50.014
stepping out on your own.

15:50.081 --> 15:51.192
You know, someone's telling you,

15:51.216 --> 15:52.783
you could be the next king

15:52.851 --> 15:54.385
or some kind of horse shit.

15:55.553 --> 15:56.968
Come on, just tell me.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.382
Bruno will let you down.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.036
He'll let you down softly.
He might even take your hand,

16:02.060 --> 16:03.406
walk you outside.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.977
Hell, who knows, he might
even blow you in the car.

16:07.658 --> 16:08.984
I've done worse.

16:10.468 --> 16:11.535
So?

16:14.075 --> 16:18.212
Kiss my ass, you Irish prick.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.312
All right. Forget about it.

16:23.748 --> 16:25.482
This piece of shit's
not gonna say anything.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.546
I'm done! It's your turn, Gio.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.855
<i>Attend, attend! Wait, wait, wait!</i>

16:31.923 --> 16:33.524
Hey! Hey!

16:33.591 --> 16:35.511
Yeah, yeah.

16:35.827 --> 16:37.027
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:38.830 --> 16:39.984
I kill you!

16:48.606 --> 16:50.107
You son of a bitch!

16:53.445 --> 16:57.014
Don't you throw up,
Bruno, you'll spoil my dinner.

17:03.521 --> 17:05.176
Sorry, I'm late.

17:05.557 --> 17:06.834
We waited for you, except for Pops.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.560
When it's time to eat,
you eat, you know.

17:09.094 --> 17:10.201
Declan.

17:10.701 --> 17:12.840
He's busy, so stays late,
that's all right.

17:13.153 --> 17:14.426
Everything okay?

17:14.933 --> 17:17.130
Yeah, I'm great.
How are things with you?

17:17.268 --> 17:19.154
Boring.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.241
- Boring's good.
- I know.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.473
You bored?

17:23.540 --> 17:25.309
I can't say that I am.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.615
<i>Buon appetito.</i>

17:27.244 --> 17:28.946
You look good, Declan.

17:29.014 --> 17:31.949
I know. Thank you, Diana. As do you.

17:36.187 --> 17:38.185
Those SQ idiots are outside again.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.357
After last night,

17:40.425 --> 17:42.593
never hurts to have
an extra set of eyes.

17:46.318 --> 17:47.718
How'd it go in the east end?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.443
He finally came around.

17:56.107 --> 17:57.552
Give me a name.

17:58.240 --> 17:59.779
I'll make it all stop.

18:05.955 --> 18:06.955
Good man.

18:11.482 --> 18:12.482
Okay.

18:12.707 --> 18:13.707
No more bodies.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.161
- Good work.
- Thanks.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.138
Interrupting?

18:22.467 --> 18:24.904
I should get going.
I still got things to do.

18:25.136 --> 18:26.170
Nico.

18:31.562 --> 18:32.762
Everything okay?

18:35.001 --> 18:37.469
- What's the problem?
- I should be in here with you.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.287
He gets to know all your
secrets, but I'm your son.

18:41.986 --> 18:43.307
I should be a part of everything.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.099
You don't get to know my secrets,
'cause I don't want you to.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.560
- Declan's on the front line...
- And I'm willing to be.

18:49.837 --> 18:50.872
I'm not.

18:52.247 --> 18:54.997
It's my job to keep you safe. All right?

19:18.435 --> 19:20.771
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:21.805 --> 19:24.173
I have to work in an hour, but
I'm really glad you called.

19:24.241 --> 19:25.505
I missed you.

19:26.210 --> 19:27.865
Was just in the neighborhood.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.263
I got you something.

19:37.576 --> 19:38.843
My God!

19:39.790 --> 19:41.524
This is so beautiful.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.544
I saw it and I thought

19:45.294 --> 19:46.810
it would be fantastic on you.

19:47.097 --> 19:48.932
Here, let me put it on.

19:52.387 --> 19:54.388
This... I've never
had anything like this.

19:54.504 --> 19:55.810
Now you do.

19:57.222 --> 19:59.690
You know, you don't have to
buy me such expensive things.

19:59.843 --> 20:01.091
I don't want you for that.

20:01.972 --> 20:03.543
I don't have to buy anything.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.259
If you don't like it,
we can take it back.

20:06.283 --> 20:07.417
- No.
- Yeah.

20:07.484 --> 20:10.169
No. Absolutely not.

20:10.287 --> 20:11.537
Let's go to the hotel.

20:12.273 --> 20:13.874
I thought you said you had to work.

20:13.958 --> 20:15.107
I do.

20:15.326 --> 20:16.726
I guess I'm gonna be late.

20:16.794 --> 20:18.094
- I guess so.
- Yeah.

20:52.596 --> 20:53.997
Thanks, Michelle.

20:54.064 --> 20:55.599
That was fantastic.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.646
I wouldn't mind some more wine.

21:00.604 --> 21:02.005
What's wrong?

21:04.052 --> 21:05.309
All right, what's wrong?

21:11.015 --> 21:13.149
Come on. What's bugging you?
What's wrong?

21:15.352 --> 21:18.818
My friend Josee, she saw some
20yearold getting into your limo.

21:21.859 --> 21:23.372
That's what's bothering you.

21:24.089 --> 21:25.622
That's what all this is about?

21:27.731 --> 21:28.740
It's nothing.

21:29.552 --> 21:30.967
It's just Gio borrowed the car

21:31.035 --> 21:32.997
to impress some young girl, that's it.

21:33.294 --> 21:35.071
I would rather you admit to screwing her

21:35.139 --> 21:37.412
than feed me
a line of bullshit like that.

21:39.091 --> 21:41.110
I never ask you to leave your wife.

21:41.178 --> 21:43.613
I never complain that
we can't spend your birthday

21:43.680 --> 21:45.548
or Christmas or New Year's together.

21:45.616 --> 21:48.076
I accept the real you.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.591
I've accepted that I probably
won't have any children

21:51.822 --> 21:53.723
and that I may even stay your mistress

21:53.791 --> 21:55.240
for the rest of our lives.

21:56.309 --> 21:57.966
But I won't stand for this anymore.

21:58.562 --> 22:01.197
And you will treat me
with the respect I deserve.

22:06.928 --> 22:08.115
You're right.

22:09.729 --> 22:10.996
I'm sorry.

22:13.648 --> 22:15.747
I won't ever disrespect you again.

22:19.791 --> 22:22.026
You better never see her again.

22:25.522 --> 22:26.956
I'm gonna take a shower.

22:28.896 --> 22:30.460
I got a meeting later tonight.

22:30.527 --> 22:31.951
Yeah, I know.

23:04.962 --> 23:06.271
Is he coming?

23:06.964 --> 23:08.604
Yeah, he's busy.
He's coming. He's coming.

23:09.644 --> 23:11.278
I need to talk to Vito.

23:11.533 --> 23:14.279
I was going to take care of that
piece of shit, Rejean, myself.

23:14.538 --> 23:16.105
We're all gonna talk about it, Jacques.

23:16.173 --> 23:18.374
<i>Non, non.</i> You don't talk
to us. He's talking to us.

23:18.442 --> 23:20.843
And I got an issue
with one of my suppliers.

23:20.911 --> 23:22.591
I need Vito to step in.

23:22.980 --> 23:24.068
We will.

23:24.348 --> 23:25.648
Mick, come on.

23:25.716 --> 23:26.896
You must have a problem too.

23:28.052 --> 23:29.619
Hemorrhoids.

23:29.686 --> 23:31.576
- Can Vito fix that?
- That's funny.

23:31.601 --> 23:33.803
He's coming. He's coming.
Sit down. Sit down.

23:33.828 --> 23:35.341
Good to see you.

23:35.692 --> 23:37.130
Take a seat, everybody.

23:41.632 --> 23:43.310
Hi. We all know why we're here.

23:43.537 --> 23:44.802
We all know the issues.

23:45.125 --> 23:47.760
Turns out one of the Devil's
Kings went out on their own.

23:47.938 --> 23:50.640
Jacques didn't know anything about it.

23:50.707 --> 23:53.013
So, let me put that question
to rest right now.

23:53.644 --> 23:56.679
But this guy, Rejean, made
a side deal with the Bonannos.

23:56.747 --> 23:59.990
Ratfaced pricks trying to force
their way into our action.

24:00.250 --> 24:02.451
And this isn't
the first time, believe me.

24:02.519 --> 24:03.853
They wanna take your business.

24:03.921 --> 24:05.755
And they know the only way is to go

24:05.822 --> 24:07.833
and get rid of our good
friend and leader.

24:08.677 --> 24:12.128
This isn't the first time they
have tried to unsettle the apple cart,

24:12.196 --> 24:13.701
and it won't be the last.

24:14.068 --> 24:16.176
All right? I'm gonna stop
before I get all worked up.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.600
Vito, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

24:17.668 --> 24:18.668
Listen.

24:18.731 --> 24:20.497
Right now, we're all doing very well.

24:20.771 --> 24:22.162
Things are going smooth.

24:22.673 --> 24:23.935
Things are peaceful.

24:24.875 --> 24:27.115
But these New York jerks are
gonna keep coming back at us

24:27.144 --> 24:28.372
to take what is ours.

24:29.346 --> 24:30.787
And they're counting on the fact

24:31.215 --> 24:34.771
that we're gonna turn on each
other for a few extra bucks.

24:35.819 --> 24:39.055
If anybody here thinks that they're
gonna do better with the Bonannos

24:39.247 --> 24:42.302
or the Irish, or the Bikers,

24:43.038 --> 24:44.208
or the Haitians,

24:45.166 --> 24:46.466
let me remind you,

24:46.974 --> 24:49.091
you're not going after
the Rizzuto family.

24:49.777 --> 24:51.412
You're going after City Hall.

24:52.803 --> 24:53.951
The policemen.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.427
The guy who shovels snow
from your driveway,

24:57.557 --> 24:59.193
drives your kids' school bus.

25:01.227 --> 25:02.544
I own them all.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.287
And they don't want blood on the street.

25:09.486 --> 25:10.720
And they got my back.

25:16.764 --> 25:18.216
Let me make some acquisitions.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.711
Already taken care of.

25:19.778 --> 25:20.879
Great.

25:22.276 --> 25:24.486
We might have a bit of a problem
with the parking structure.

25:24.510 --> 25:26.361
We need 10 feet deeper
than they're willing to allow.

25:26.385 --> 25:27.698
It's already done.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.284
Great.

25:29.855 --> 25:32.377
And, one more thing.

25:33.259 --> 25:36.205
From now on, no more commission.

25:36.862 --> 25:38.323
I just get a straight 10%.

25:39.365 --> 25:40.737
- Equity?
- Yeah.

25:41.198 --> 25:43.776
Vito, I already have investors.

25:45.316 --> 25:47.117
Not without the permits, you don't.

25:47.239 --> 25:48.940
Not without my construction people.

25:49.008 --> 25:52.777
Not without the union bosses,
without them, you got shit.

25:52.845 --> 25:54.913
Yeah, but, I pay people for those.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.807
And I pay you to let
me pay them for those.

25:56.832 --> 25:59.291
You no longer have to pay me 2.5%.

25:59.852 --> 26:01.429
You don't have to pay it
to the commission.

26:01.453 --> 26:03.188
You don't have to pay it
to construction.

26:03.255 --> 26:04.971
You no longer inflate

26:05.424 --> 26:07.492
your building cost reports, all right?

26:07.560 --> 26:10.057
I want you to do what you do best.

26:11.096 --> 26:13.965
Build big, tall, beautiful
buildings in the sky

26:14.033 --> 26:17.057
and I'm gonna be
your silent equity partner.

26:17.603 --> 26:21.580
Now, all other projects that
are in play, they stay as is.

26:21.982 --> 26:25.338
But from that point on,
everything is legit.

26:26.532 --> 26:27.532
You understand?

26:28.714 --> 26:30.448
- Yeah.
- Take your shot.

26:39.191 --> 26:42.041
I want to legitimize our
interests across the board.

26:42.161 --> 26:44.541
You just wanna drop all our businesses?

26:44.624 --> 26:45.705
No.

26:46.265 --> 26:47.632
Slowly pull back.

26:48.934 --> 26:51.362
I wanna implement like a longterm plan.

26:51.846 --> 26:53.760
I mean, it's funny, 'cause we're...

26:54.173 --> 26:55.873
We're at a point now where

26:55.941 --> 26:58.377
our operation is running so smoothly,

26:58.677 --> 27:00.912
it's basically on autopilot, right?

27:00.980 --> 27:02.659
Everyone's getting along.

27:02.982 --> 27:04.682
We got money coming in so fast,

27:04.750 --> 27:06.299
we don't even know how much we got.

27:06.330 --> 27:08.230
Half these guys don't even
carry a piece anymore.

27:08.254 --> 27:10.580
And now, you just wanna step aside?

27:12.073 --> 27:13.393
Listen, Declan.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.862
I've been working to get
to this point my whole life.

27:19.465 --> 27:20.865
And yet just when you think

27:20.933 --> 27:23.049
that nobody would dare cross us,

27:23.535 --> 27:26.771
some animals decide to come to my home

27:26.839 --> 27:29.974
trying to take a shot at me,
with my family there.

27:31.944 --> 27:33.645
This is that life, Declan.

27:33.712 --> 27:35.385
It's always gonna be that way.

27:35.714 --> 27:37.192
It doesn't matter
how much money we have.

27:37.216 --> 27:39.643
It doesn't matter
how many pockets we line.

27:41.387 --> 27:43.354
We respect tradition.

27:44.556 --> 27:47.392
- We respect family.
- Yeah.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.377
We have honor, but we are...

27:50.863 --> 27:52.730
in a business that requires us

27:52.798 --> 27:54.532
to deal with these animals
who walk around

27:54.600 --> 27:56.367
thinking they can wear the crown.

27:57.936 --> 28:02.463
We can't rely on them
to determine our existence.

28:03.509 --> 28:06.377
We've evolved, do you understand?

28:06.445 --> 28:08.446
We've evolved and they haven't.

28:08.514 --> 28:09.916
- And they never will.
- Okay.

28:10.182 --> 28:11.455
Do you understand that?

28:11.837 --> 28:12.837
I do.

28:12.917 --> 28:13.951
All right.

28:14.119 --> 28:16.754
So which hand do you do, you know,
the swing with the club?

28:16.779 --> 28:19.368
The golf thing.
I don't know. Right. Left.

28:19.393 --> 28:21.793
Fantastic. Hey, Jimmy, we'll
take, two sets of these.

28:21.860 --> 28:22.894
Thanks.

28:29.535 --> 28:30.729
Hey, Pop!

28:31.837 --> 28:33.838
Well, today I'm a mechanic.

28:35.407 --> 28:36.407
Yeah.

28:38.210 --> 28:39.284
Yeah, sure.

28:39.645 --> 28:40.645
About an hour?

28:41.814 --> 28:43.307
Yeah. Just let me get cleaned up.

28:44.149 --> 28:45.249
Okay. Bye.

29:01.266 --> 29:03.510
Listen to this, last
night, I got the hiccups.

29:03.932 --> 29:06.291
I haven't had the hiccups in,
I don't know, 20 years.

29:06.508 --> 29:09.277
I know this guy who had the
hiccups for 10 years straight.

29:09.924 --> 29:12.088
- It killed him.
- Get out of here.

29:12.194 --> 29:14.823
- No, really.
- The hiccups killed him?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.448
Having hiccups 10 years
straight made him crazy.

29:17.516 --> 29:18.916
Jumping off a bridge killed him.

29:26.158 --> 29:28.279
You said on the phone you
wanted to tell me something.

29:28.660 --> 29:29.994
Yeah.

29:30.062 --> 29:32.471
It's about that conversation
we had the other night.

29:34.620 --> 29:37.151
I don't wanna keep you
out of my life, Nico.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.502
I don't wanna exclude you.

29:40.643 --> 29:44.284
I wanna legitimize all our businesses,
you know, across the board.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.557
You know, when you do
that, you need,

29:47.913 --> 29:49.981
you need a face of the company.

29:50.616 --> 29:51.823
I can't do that.

29:52.851 --> 29:53.885
You can.

29:56.922 --> 29:58.104
You're really gonna do that?

29:59.358 --> 30:02.487
Yeah, I mean... Now's the perfect time.

30:03.061 --> 30:04.877
We got plenty of money, protection.

30:07.900 --> 30:08.924
Look,

30:09.551 --> 30:11.526
I... I don't want you to be a boss.

30:15.445 --> 30:17.279
I want you to be a CEO.

30:28.234 --> 30:29.729
What do these idiots want?

30:41.600 --> 30:42.934
Mr. Rizzuto?

30:44.903 --> 30:46.244
What can I help you with?

30:46.622 --> 30:48.705
This is an extradition order

30:49.007 --> 30:51.143
from the United States
Justice Department.

30:51.910 --> 30:53.526
We're here to place you under arrest.

30:53.812 --> 30:54.838
For what?

30:55.814 --> 30:57.705
Think back to 1981.

30:57.916 --> 31:00.017
The murders of Alphonse Indelicato,

31:00.085 --> 31:02.252
Philip Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera.

31:03.255 --> 31:05.909
I bet you never thought you'd hear
those names again, did you?

31:06.959 --> 31:08.299
I never heard of 'em.

31:37.441 --> 31:38.541
Vito?

31:39.743 --> 31:42.055
Vito, would you close the goddamn
window, it's freezing in here.

31:42.079 --> 31:43.573
I want the window open.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.112
Sandro, are you cold in here?

31:46.580 --> 31:48.345
- It's a little cold.
- It's a little cold.

31:48.717 --> 31:50.213
- I'm cold.
- We're cold.

31:51.188 --> 31:52.599
Look, I don't wanna smoke up the car.

31:52.623 --> 31:54.886
We'll smell like smoke.
You don't show up to a meeting

31:55.186 --> 31:56.887
smelling like smoke.

31:58.144 --> 31:59.480
It's unprofessional.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.019
So, don't smoke.

32:01.284 --> 32:02.558
I want a cigarette.

32:02.956 --> 32:04.834
What's your problem?
You got the heater on.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.011
It's 10 below outside. I got the
heater on, the window open.

32:08.472 --> 32:10.394
I'm freezing and sweating
my balls off in here.

32:11.690 --> 32:14.017
You know, the rules are,
the driver chooses the music

32:14.042 --> 32:15.159
and the temperature.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.047
Well, we got different rules here.

32:19.524 --> 32:20.753
Anyway, it's time.

32:22.487 --> 32:24.288
Big Mike says we go around the back.

32:38.335 --> 32:40.612
All right, here you go.

32:41.472 --> 32:43.394
- Salute!
- Salute.

32:46.495 --> 32:47.511
All right.

32:50.033 --> 32:51.589
You're all gonna wear those.

32:52.948 --> 32:54.148
Those are clean.

32:54.193 --> 32:55.503
No serial numbers.

32:57.394 --> 32:58.503
What are we doing here?

32:58.889 --> 33:00.534
You're gonna rob the joint.

33:01.823 --> 33:03.790
You'll knock around the guys
that are here.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.628
Except for me. Don't touch me.

33:05.696 --> 33:07.862
You're gonna ask me to open
the safe under the bar.

33:07.997 --> 33:09.431
How rough do you want us to get?

33:09.456 --> 33:11.443
Break a nose, not a kneecap.

33:11.468 --> 33:12.468
You know what I mean.

33:15.606 --> 33:16.988
Why bring us down for this?

33:17.013 --> 33:18.675
You could have had anybody do this.

33:20.308 --> 33:22.253
Anybody can wave a gun.

33:22.916 --> 33:24.628
Not everybody can be trusted.

33:27.550 --> 33:30.052
Your old man owes my old man?

33:30.276 --> 33:31.564
For that thing down in Venezuela,

33:31.588 --> 33:32.894
so we're calling it in.

33:33.331 --> 33:35.324
If there was anything else
you needed to know,

33:35.524 --> 33:36.791
it'd be told.

33:41.102 --> 33:42.202
Where do you want us?

33:43.316 --> 33:44.355
Wait in there.

33:44.380 --> 33:45.691
Wait in there till you hear me,

33:45.715 --> 33:47.049
talk about going to the zoo.

33:47.102 --> 33:48.202
That'll be the signal.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.480
- The zoo?
- Hey!

33:49.998 --> 33:52.066
Everybody knows I love the zoo.

33:52.156 --> 33:53.339
It won't stand out.

33:53.597 --> 33:55.093
<i>Yeah!</i>

33:55.161 --> 33:57.300
Sonny looks like he's lost a few pounds.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.208
The doctor said I need to exercise.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.730
Come on - So we got a dog.

34:01.755 --> 34:03.067
I take it for a walk around
the park every day.

34:03.091 --> 34:04.198
Nah, nah, nah, nah!

34:04.292 --> 34:06.315
He lost weight 'cause his wife
stopped making cannelloni.

34:06.339 --> 34:07.573
See?

34:07.640 --> 34:09.956
But every time he takes the dog
for a walk, instead of cooking,

34:09.981 --> 34:11.781
she comes over to my place
for a little screw.

34:12.620 --> 34:13.745
I don't like this.

34:13.878 --> 34:16.128
Come all this way for a smack and grab?

34:16.800 --> 34:19.784
He's a capo. What are you gonna do?
Say no?

34:19.925 --> 34:21.592
Your father says to do what he says.

34:21.621 --> 34:23.021
- I'd do what he says.
- Quiet.

34:23.089 --> 34:24.822
I never took you as an animal guy.

34:24.848 --> 34:26.292
- I love dogs.
- You know what?

34:26.317 --> 34:28.551
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta come with me to the zoo.

34:28.574 --> 34:30.034
Here goes the zoo.

34:30.534 --> 34:31.722
What's with you and the zoo?

34:31.746 --> 34:33.341
Hey, these are majestic animals.

34:33.366 --> 34:34.900
Don't move!

34:34.967 --> 34:36.268
God damn!

34:36.335 --> 34:37.936
What the hell is this?

34:40.139 --> 34:41.841
Stay on the goddamn floor!

34:50.773 --> 34:51.846
Guns...

34:52.739 --> 34:53.774
On the bar.

34:55.774 --> 34:56.908
Slowly!

35:01.026 --> 35:02.682
- You got it?
- I got it.

35:04.725 --> 35:06.045
You know who you're playing with?

35:06.286 --> 35:07.286
Yeah.

35:07.437 --> 35:10.354
A guy with his dog with his
two fat backup singers.

35:11.874 --> 35:13.104
Hey, <i>stronzo,</i>

35:13.906 --> 35:15.474
empty the safe behind the bar.

35:15.541 --> 35:17.901
You're dead men, you know that right?

35:18.382 --> 35:19.682
We're all capos.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.113
How stupid can you be?

35:21.180 --> 35:23.284
Not as stupid as you, Sonny.

35:25.432 --> 35:26.660
What the hell was that?

35:26.684 --> 35:29.121
You jagoffs! You think
you can run my father out?

35:29.188 --> 35:30.965
What are you talking about,
Mike? We'd never do...

35:30.989 --> 35:32.792
You would never what?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.693
- Mike, Mike...
- He's my father!

35:34.761 --> 35:36.753
You greedy bastard!

35:39.541 --> 35:41.659
You were family, Phil.

35:42.011 --> 35:44.312
Now you... You're dog shit!

35:48.107 --> 35:49.574
No, Mike!

36:02.288 --> 36:03.288
No, Mike...

36:03.656 --> 36:06.932
Trin, you're too stupid to
deserve a beating like that.

36:17.737 --> 36:19.120
What the hell was that?

36:19.525 --> 36:21.025
Those asses, they were gonna

36:21.159 --> 36:23.612
try and knock off my father.
You, you believe that?

36:23.956 --> 36:26.224
Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.

36:26.589 --> 36:28.580
- Jesus, Mike.
- Stop whining.

36:29.861 --> 36:30.927
What do we do now?

36:32.946 --> 36:34.284
You gotta...

36:34.590 --> 36:35.956
You gotta clean this place up.

36:37.393 --> 36:39.157
Come on, there's, mops and buckets

36:39.225 --> 36:40.706
in the closet down the hall there.

36:45.577 --> 36:47.245
Come on, let's get this over with.

36:58.135 --> 36:59.425
Watch your feet.

37:10.992 --> 37:13.160
You know, we're never
gonna get this all out.

37:13.335 --> 37:14.970
Come on, my <i>nonni</i> used
to clean up messes

37:14.994 --> 37:16.359
worse than this all the time.

37:16.945 --> 37:18.359
Hey, look around.

37:18.384 --> 37:21.148
We've been at this for three
hours. We're not even close.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.179
You know, maybe if you hadn't
smashed his head to pieces

37:24.203 --> 37:25.499
and shot him in the face.

37:27.277 --> 37:29.579
Maybe I went a little overboard.

37:32.612 --> 37:34.007
I got a better idea.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.414
Hey, you guys hungry?

37:44.624 --> 37:46.425
There's a pretty good deli near here.

37:46.492 --> 37:47.793
It's six blocks that way.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.288
Hang a right,
it's right on the corner?

37:53.032 --> 37:54.742
Hey. Six blocks.

37:54.899 --> 37:56.023
Hang a right.

37:56.602 --> 37:57.671
Drive carefully.

37:58.369 --> 37:59.468
Thanks, fellas.

38:13.867 --> 38:15.288
Vito, we gotta go.

38:44.548 --> 38:46.344
What the hell is this, Renata?

38:47.317 --> 38:48.985
You're being charged with racketeering.

38:49.052 --> 38:50.186
For what?

38:50.253 --> 38:51.531
This all has to do with the murder

38:51.555 --> 38:52.755
of the Bonanno captains.

38:52.823 --> 38:54.641
It was like 100 years ago.

38:54.992 --> 38:58.260
Big Mike Cecchin turned State's witness.

38:58.328 --> 39:00.172
He's saying you're the one
who killed them.

39:00.197 --> 39:01.998
Yeah, well, he's insane.

39:02.065 --> 39:03.566
He did it and everybody knows.

39:03.634 --> 39:05.167
Maybe everybody does.

39:05.235 --> 39:07.603
But he's a big witness for the Feds.

39:07.671 --> 39:11.641
This is the first boss
ever to turn State's witness.

39:11.708 --> 39:13.075
But you're my lawyer.

39:13.143 --> 39:14.829
Block the extradition.

39:15.245 --> 39:17.149
If they can't get me to court,
they got nothing.

39:17.381 --> 39:19.032
With all due respect, Vito,

39:19.416 --> 39:21.550
the US Justice Department
wanted to charge you

39:21.618 --> 39:22.985
with all three murders,

39:23.053 --> 39:25.621
but New York State carries
the death penalty.

39:25.689 --> 39:29.368
Canada wouldn't extradite if
there was any chance of that.

39:29.995 --> 39:34.733
The charge of racketeering is
to guarantee the extradition.

39:37.488 --> 39:38.844
You're going to trial.

39:41.438 --> 39:43.977
Trust me, I got this. All right?

39:44.033 --> 39:45.337
I got this.

39:45.590 --> 39:47.691
You guys have absolutely
nothing to worry about.

39:49.232 --> 39:50.540
Is he joking?

39:50.914 --> 39:52.329
He's not, actually.

39:52.716 --> 39:53.837
Jacques.

39:54.117 --> 39:55.361
How many times you've been busted?

39:55.385 --> 39:56.919
Not by the FBI.

39:56.987 --> 39:58.631
It's not the FBI.
It's the Justice Department.

39:58.655 --> 39:59.755
I don't give a shit.

39:59.823 --> 40:01.034
Vito is gonna be gone for a long time.

40:01.058 --> 40:02.168
How're you gonna handle that?

40:02.192 --> 40:03.459
When you call in sick,

40:03.527 --> 40:05.528
does your whole operation just stop? No.

40:05.595 --> 40:07.340
Everyone keeps doing
what they're doing...

40:08.469 --> 40:10.332
The products that we
move keep on moving.

40:10.400 --> 40:11.701
The people that we serve...

40:11.768 --> 40:13.369
He doesn't have a goddamn cold!

40:13.437 --> 40:14.770
Everyone, take a moment.

40:16.186 --> 40:17.353
Take a moment.

40:18.673 --> 40:20.024
This is a stressful time.

40:20.677 --> 40:23.805
But let me remind you who this
is most stressful for, Vito.

40:24.959 --> 40:27.501
He's always taken very good care of us.

40:28.485 --> 40:29.852
He's responsible for the fruits

40:29.920 --> 40:31.187
that we all currently bear,

40:31.254 --> 40:33.868
so now we owe it to him
to keep the ship steady

40:33.946 --> 40:35.673
so he can focus on getting back home.

40:36.454 --> 40:37.516
Okay.

40:38.266 --> 40:40.821
All right so, we meet twice a week.

40:41.293 --> 40:42.837
Stay on top of this, all right?

41:22.079 --> 41:23.739
We could hire OJ's lawyers.

41:23.807 --> 41:25.462
- Shut up.
- What?

41:25.508 --> 41:27.109
Johnnie Cochran's dead.

41:28.211 --> 41:29.571
I didn't know.

41:31.939 --> 41:33.070
Come on.

41:33.784 --> 41:35.261
Vito's the man
who makes miracles happen.

41:35.285 --> 41:36.418
He's gonna be fine.

41:36.486 --> 41:38.287
No, no, this is different.

41:39.337 --> 41:40.743
This is a US warrant.

41:41.321 --> 41:42.844
Extraditing papers.

41:43.327 --> 41:45.743
They don't go this far unless
they got something solid.

41:47.777 --> 41:48.810
Nico.

41:52.121 --> 41:53.989
From now on,
I'm in on every meeting.

41:56.204 --> 41:57.540
This is business.

41:58.631 --> 41:59.649
Yeah.

42:00.813 --> 42:03.376
And our business partners need
to know who's in control.

42:04.508 --> 42:06.079
I've got things covered, Nico.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.560
My father is
about to fight for his life.

42:09.143 --> 42:10.273
For his name.

42:11.201 --> 42:13.376
Someone from the family
needs to be in charge.

42:14.903 --> 42:16.344
Declan is family.

42:17.528 --> 42:19.813
Declan, I know how much
my father values you.

42:21.823 --> 42:23.071
But you're not family.

42:33.634 --> 42:37.423
<i>Vito Rizzuto, now serving
a prison term in the U.S.,</i>

42:37.587 --> 42:40.022
<i>in connection with three
old murders in New York.</i>

42:44.778 --> 42:47.501
<i>Vito got 10 years,
minus time already served.</i>

42:47.985 --> 42:49.204
<i>The judge sent him all the way</i>

42:49.229 --> 42:51.833
<i>to Colorado Federal
Penitentiary to do his time</i>

42:51.901 --> 42:54.416
<i>just so he wouldn't be near any
of his known associates' family.</i>

42:54.440 --> 42:55.774
<i>Thanks a lot, Judge.</i>

42:56.539 --> 42:59.665
<i>I knew he could do the time,
he could handle anything.</i>

43:00.325 --> 43:01.758
<i>But everyone else?</i>

43:02.847 --> 43:05.868
<i>Well, let me just say, that
shit was about to hit the fan,</i>

43:05.893 --> 43:08.427
<i>the wall, the whole goddamn house.</i>

<i>Next time on Bad Blood...</i>

43:18.416 --> 43:22.923
The number one priority is
to focus on the family.

43:23.039 --> 43:24.087
Yeah.

43:24.112 --> 43:25.798
Taking care of my son.

43:25.823 --> 43:27.587
I believe we have
some business to discuss.

43:27.612 --> 43:29.102
We had that discussion.

43:29.111 --> 43:30.812
I told you I'm not paying anymore,

43:30.880 --> 43:32.580
then I hung up the phone.

43:32.648 --> 43:34.133
Now piss off, Junior.

43:35.918 --> 43:37.953
How do you do something like this

43:38.020 --> 43:39.187
without consulting anyone?

43:39.255 --> 43:40.655
The message has to be clear.

43:40.723 --> 43:44.125
Vito may be gone, but the
Rizzutos still run everything.

43:44.193 --> 43:46.673
Did you hear that last part,
Declan? The Rizzutos.
