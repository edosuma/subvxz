00:13.138 --> 00:15.265

00:18.393 --> 00:20.020
[narrator]  Truth be told,

00:20.103 --> 00:23.064
Lionel's style is more
sartorial mono-classic,

00:23.148 --> 00:25.483
but it will be some years
before he figures that out.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.860
[Lionel] I got the wrong tie.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.653

00:30.321 --> 00:31.489
Got you, man.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.742
[narrator]  Lionel's never bothered

00:33.825 --> 00:35.618
to identify his style before,

00:35.702 --> 00:37.871
having assumed it never mattered.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.331
So how did we get here?

00:40.415 --> 00:42.125
Watch closely.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.877
[crowd clamoring]

00:43.960 --> 00:45.795
[narrator]  It begins with a bang...

00:45.879 --> 00:47.797
What part of "The Hancocks
are off-limits" possessed you

00:47.881 --> 00:49.549
to post a story about the Hancocks?

00:49.632 --> 00:52.719
This is important to me,
and if you want me on  The Independent,

00:52.802 --> 00:54.345
these are the types of stories
I'm gonna write,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.181
and if you don't like it,
then you can just go fuck--

00:56.264 --> 00:58.975
[narrator]  ...and a spark.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.727
But before we get to that,

01:00.810 --> 01:02.437
there are some hidden forces at play

01:02.520 --> 01:04.105
worth examining.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.357
1924-- William Landis,

01:06.441 --> 01:07.776
founder of  The Winchester Bugle,

01:07.859 --> 01:11.071
publishes a landmark exposé
on Ivy League secret societies.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.531
It would earn him a position
at  The New York Times,

01:13.615 --> 01:16.159
setting in motion a tradition
of nepotism and privilege

01:16.242 --> 01:17.619
that would ensure a pipeline

01:17.702 --> 01:19.996
to the nation's
most powerful publications.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.248
Damn, I love an alliterative P.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.166
[flashbulb pops]

01:23.249 --> 01:25.376
1965-- Donald Hancock,

01:25.460 --> 01:27.253
having run afoul with the  Bugle  editor

01:27.337 --> 01:29.005
due to his right-wing politics,

01:29.088 --> 01:30.715
founds  The Winchester Independent.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.135
Its coverage had a decidedly
different point of view.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.180
The Hancocks are absolutely off-limits.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.140
[narrator]  As years and attitudes changed,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.559
the voice of Donald Hancock faded
from  The Independent,

01:41.643 --> 01:43.520
but he continued to enjoy
the tax write-off

01:43.603 --> 01:45.438
financing the paper would provide.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.441
All that changed with Lionel.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.026
He would prove to be the nail
in the coffin

01:50.110 --> 01:51.444
for  The Independent's  financing.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.239
They're using their money
to blackmail the administration

01:54.322 --> 01:56.825
into integrating Armstrong-Parker.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.326
That's enough, young man.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.578
Right about... now,

02:00.662 --> 02:03.665
you should all be receiving an alert
from the  Winchester Independent  website.

That's because his BONR profile
says "whites only."

10:08.524 --> 10:09.567
[laughs]

10:09.650 --> 10:11.569
He's like a 1950s water fountain.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.820
[laughing]

10:12.903 --> 10:15.448
Only squirting for the whites.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.241
[softly] Way too much.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.284
[George] In Zak's defense, though,

10:18.367 --> 10:20.161
he did change it to "all-American"

10:20.244 --> 10:21.454
after Freddie from comparative lit

10:21.537 --> 10:24.373
called him out in his editorial
on problematic gays.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.666
[man] Can we retire that word?

10:25.750 --> 10:26.876
[George] "Gays"? Immediately.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.879
[man] "Problematic."

10:29.962 --> 10:31.797
George has an affinity for chocolate.

whatever has legs.

-Look at you, having standards.
-Mm.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.934
I like emotionally unavailable guys

10:44.018 --> 10:46.270
with an acumen for mixed signals.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.480
Wait.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.357
Are we still allowed to say "rice queen"?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.608
We're fags.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.234
We're not allowed to exist
in half the world,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.278
so why do we have to play by its rules?

10:54.362 --> 10:55.988
Says white guys who just want

10:56.072 --> 10:58.199
to reduce Asians to a complex carb.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.367
[clears throat]

10:59.450 --> 11:00.451
[softly] Sorry.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.702
[George] Don't take it personally, Lionel.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.705
Nicolas here is very sensitive
about being white.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.208
[Lionel] Where were you two?

11:07.291 --> 11:08.376
We should go.

-What do we think of this AltIvyW guy?
-[Topper] That guy.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.385
He's either a monster
or a performance artist.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.470
That's the one who baits
social justice warriors for fun?

11:19.553 --> 11:21.305
Mm. He called Sam White a half-breed.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.224
Okay, but he's clearly doing it as a joke.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.559
It's his sycophants that are
taking it way too far.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.019
And that podcast?

11:27.103 --> 11:29.397
Well, then maybe it wasn't
so clear it was a joke.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.775

-[Topper] No.
-[George] Yeah.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.364
Okay, we can leave now.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.532
[George] Honey, it is

11:39.615 --> 11:42.827
a complex, deep dive into a family--

11:42.910 --> 11:45.413
You are way too invested, George.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.999
[Silvio] Should we get you
something a little stronger?

Oh, you're giving mammograms now?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.768
Well, her best friend's been
in the bathroom

12:07.852 --> 12:09.562
with someone named Thad for 20 minutes.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.147
Thad? Ugh, her best friend's

12:11.230 --> 12:13.441
about four or five seconds from herpes.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.067
Hey, how do you know George?

12:15.609 --> 12:17.570
I used to write for  The Bugle.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.071
We had a weird moment.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.157
What do you do when someone asks you,

12:21.240 --> 12:23.451
sans irony, for your Hershey's Kisses?

12:23.534 --> 12:25.453
You give him your Hershey's Kisses.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.829
With nuts.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.164
Wait.

think-piece everything,

wouldn't feel like they have to

fired over sushi night?

Uh, come with me.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.236
Be right back. For real.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.366
[sighs]

20:25.599 --> 20:27.851
[man] Thank God for cell phones, huh?

20:27.935 --> 20:31.480
Like, what did people used to do
at parties before?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.649
Talk to each other?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.108
How far we've come.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.277
I mean, there's always smoking.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.112
Cancer seems like a small price to pay

20:39.196 --> 20:41.698
for stuff to do with your hands.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.784
[both laugh]

20:45.369 --> 20:46.495
I'm Wesley.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.455
I'm Lionel.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.624
What brings you here?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.000
Uh...

20:52.793 --> 20:54.586
the love of my life,

20:55.796 --> 20:57.130
Adam.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.592
My first clue things
weren't gonna work out

21:00.676 --> 21:02.886
was when he kept introducing me to friends

21:02.970 --> 21:05.931
who were really into Latino guys.

21:06.014 --> 21:06.974
[Lionel scoffs]

21:07.057 --> 21:08.642
Why do people do that?

21:08.725 --> 21:10.769
Like it's some grand compliment

21:10.852 --> 21:12.938
that someone can tolerate me.

21:13.021 --> 21:15.482
We love coming up with reasons
to reject our own.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.442
It's like the gay First Commandment.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.070
"Do unto others
as has been done unto you."

21:20.696 --> 21:22.739
[laughs]

21:25.659 --> 21:26.910
I'm Lionel.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.078
You said that.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.413
Oh. [laughs]

21:29.496 --> 21:32.332
Hmm. Ah, finally.

21:32.457 --> 21:33.458
Finally what?

21:34.626 --> 21:36.878
And what's with the keys?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.131
I lost them a while ago.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.216
That's why you keep disappearing?

21:41.300 --> 21:42.843
This whole thing is about backtracking

21:42.926 --> 21:44.386
where you left your keys?

21:44.469 --> 21:45.304
And hanging out with you.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.098
There's literally been no hanging out
with me all night.

21:48.181 --> 21:50.267
I mean, how many of these did you hit up

21:50.350 --> 21:51.810
before you stumbled over to my place?

21:51.893 --> 21:53.895
Girl, please don't go
all Kenya Moore on me.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.023
You know I don't understand
that reference.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.774
I mean, what the...

21:59.318 --> 22:00.652
What the fuck, Silvio?

22:00.736 --> 22:02.654
Ooh, she cusses.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.119
Lionel!

22:14.416 --> 22:15.584
[Silvio] Lionel!

22:16.585 --> 22:18.545
Are you really making me chase you?

22:23.884 --> 22:24.926
[Lionel sighs]

22:25.010 --> 22:27.137
Do you, like, hate me or something?

22:27.929 --> 22:29.556
You kiss me out of the blue,

22:29.639 --> 22:32.684
you invite me places and then ditch me,

22:32.768 --> 22:35.437
and we still haven't talked about
what happened with the paper.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.564
-The paper? What's there to discuss?
-I don't know.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.150
Apparently, you've been discussing it
with everybody--

22:40.734 --> 22:43.445
Brooke, George, everyone but me.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.530
Just tell me, what is this?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.366
Lionel, you and I have a ship.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.659
Will it be a friendship,

22:49.743 --> 22:51.703
a situation-ship, a partnership?

22:51.787 --> 22:53.080
I don't know.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.040
I'm not the kind of guy
who needs to know right away.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.834
So you keep me on hold
until you figure it out?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.339
You're punishing me

23:03.381 --> 23:04.966
for what happened with the paper.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.511
Okay, Freud, look,
I'm pissed about what you did, all right?

23:07.594 --> 23:09.346
But at the same time...

23:10.889 --> 23:14.309
what you did was bold and brave and...

23:16.144 --> 23:17.729
[laughs] I don't know.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.650
I don't know how I feel about you, okay?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.777
Do you have feelings for me?

23:23.860 --> 23:28.073
Lionel, you are adorable.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.284
But we're in totally different
places right now.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.619
Yeah.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.455
Maybe we are.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.667
It's not like running a Winchester paper
is a hobby, you know?

23:39.209 --> 23:41.169
It's a fucking lifeline
into the real world,

23:41.253 --> 23:43.171
and on my watch,
this decades-old institution

23:43.255 --> 23:44.256
completely imploded.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.882
I'm a laughingstock among my peers.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.009
-I'm a joke.
-So what?

23:49.219 --> 23:51.721
This is the 21st century.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.974
Nobody from Winchester gains notoriety

23:54.057 --> 23:56.268
by upholding institutions.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.478
They create new ones.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.773
Right now, there's a whole
underground of alt-righters

24:01.857 --> 24:04.151
trolling students at Winchester.

24:05.652 --> 24:07.487
No one's covering that.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.950
If we got to the bottom of it,
it could be explosive,

24:12.033 --> 24:13.827
and that's just what's on my radar.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.288
What if we went looking for stories,

24:16.371 --> 24:17.956
real stories, on our own,

24:18.039 --> 24:19.875
unencumbered by print dates

24:19.958 --> 24:24.254
or budgets or any other... bullshit?

24:24.337 --> 24:27.674
What's stopping us
from creating something,

24:27.757 --> 24:30.010
something truly independent?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.722
[sighs]

24:35.473 --> 24:38.185
It would have to be exceptional.

24:39.269 --> 24:41.980
Reach beyond the campus
into the national sphere.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.942
This is something you want to do?

24:47.110 --> 24:48.570
Of course.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.367
I'll think about it, okay?

24:56.494 --> 24:58.288
Ah, fuck.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.998
What? What now?

25:00.999 --> 25:04.085
Hyundai? I'd never drive a Hyundai.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.880
Somebody's about to have a terrible night.

25:06.963 --> 25:08.757
[grunts]

25:11.176 --> 25:13.053
[sighs] So you want to come find some--

25:13.136 --> 25:16.306
I'm a little tired, Silvio, but...

25:19.935 --> 25:20.810
good luck.

25:29.569 --> 25:32.572
[chattering, laughing]

25:36.243 --> 25:37.869
-Watch where you're going.
-[Lionel] Sorry.

25:37.953 --> 25:40.830
And tell your roommate to stay
the fuck away from me, okay?

25:42.582 --> 25:43.792
Okay.

26:08.817 --> 26:10.110
