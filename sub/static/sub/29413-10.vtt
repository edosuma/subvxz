WEBVTT

00:08.878 --> 00:11.141
Thanks again for
having us over, Tina.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.664
Yeah, the chicken
and dumplings are delicious.

00:12.708 --> 00:13.883
Aren't they, Grover?

00:13.926 --> 00:16.190
Wow, that isinteresting.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.759
So I had to turn off
my football game for dinner,

00:20.803 --> 00:23.284
but the kid gets to play
world wide webs?

00:24.763 --> 00:26.939
Dad, the "world wide webs,"

00:26.983 --> 00:30.073
or as people under a hundred
call it, the Internet...

00:31.944 --> 00:34.077
...is not a game. It's-it's a,
it's a global network...

00:34.121 --> 00:35.774
Marty... you're
talking to Pop.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.299
The clock is still flashing
12:00 on his VCR.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.912
Which still has a tape of Beverly Hills Cop
stuck in it.

00:44.131 --> 00:47.264
You know what?
That was due back in 1997.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.266
Good thing Blockbuster
went out of business, huh?

00:52.226 --> 00:54.097
Grover, Mr. Calvin's right.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.317
Didn't we agree
no screens at the table?

00:56.360 --> 01:00.321
Yeah, I wasn't really sure
where we landed on that.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.281
So, Calvin, it looks like your
auto shop has some competition.

01:04.325 --> 01:06.675
I saw a new Motor Boys
opened up down the block.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.677
Please.

01:08.720 --> 01:12.637
Some generic chain
with a stupid jingle?

01:12.681 --> 01:14.335
I think it's catchy.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.641
♪ Car or truck,
you're in luck, with the ♪

01:16.685 --> 01:18.687
♪ Motor Boys. ALL: Beep! Beep!

01:21.646 --> 01:24.432
Why don't you all go "beep-beep"
yourselves, all right?

01:25.476 --> 01:26.999
Whoa!

01:27.043 --> 01:29.480
Motor Boys
has a really cool website.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.831
Grover! Didn't I just say
no screens at the table?

01:32.875 --> 01:36.357
Oh, so we are
going with that.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.360
You know,

01:39.403 --> 01:41.318
business has slowed down
since they opened up.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.320
Maybe we should think about
updating our shop.

01:43.364 --> 01:45.235
Oh, I could upgrade
your computer system.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.497
Automate your payroll.

01:46.541 --> 01:47.803
Maybe make
you a website

01:47.846 --> 01:48.978
that's not just
a picture of you

01:49.021 --> 01:50.458
laying across the
hood of a Corvette?

01:53.461 --> 01:56.072
While you're at it,
will you fix his e-mail?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.466
I send him stuff all the time.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.381
I never get a reply.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.863
Yeah, that's weird, huh?

02:04.907 --> 02:06.909
So what do
you say, Calvin?

02:06.952 --> 02:08.040
Can Marty help us out?

02:08.084 --> 02:10.391
Why not?
You can come in tomorrow.

02:10.434 --> 02:12.349
And I'll start working
on a jingle for you.

02:12.393 --> 02:15.961
Ooh, great.
E-mail it to me.

02:16.005 --> 02:17.920
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:17.963 --> 02:19.226
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:23.273 --> 02:25.884
So what goes down at an
overnight teachers' retreat?

02:25.928 --> 02:27.408
Oh, we have so much fun.

02:27.451 --> 02:30.715
PowerPoint presentations,
course lectures,

02:30.759 --> 02:31.890
and-- wait for it--

02:31.934 --> 02:34.850
we all come home
with a huge binder!

02:34.893 --> 02:38.723
My God, I married
the world's hottest nerd.

02:40.769 --> 02:41.900
All right, sweetie,
be good for Dad.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.119
I'll see you tomorrow.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.078
I don't know.
Probably in my room?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.908
You know what? You've been
on that thing a lot.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.910
Why don't we take a little
screen break for a few days?

02:51.954 --> 02:54.783
A few days?
That's so unfair.

02:54.826 --> 02:56.437
No, come on.
It's a good thing.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.178
Look, you can play
outside, climb some trees,

02:58.221 --> 02:59.788
ride your bike around.

02:59.831 --> 03:04.314
Okay, if I say I'm sorry,
can I not do any of that?

03:04.358 --> 03:06.577
All right, sweetie, I got to go.
Give me a hug.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.014
I'll miss you, Mom.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.060
So, so...I'm with Dad.

03:11.103 --> 03:13.802
Bye.
Cheer up.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.238
You're gonna
have so much fun.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.066
It's gonna be great.

03:17.109 --> 03:19.111
It's gonna be terrible.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.593
What are you talking about?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.682
I have tried
the "no screens" thing before,

03:24.726 --> 03:26.815
and it always ends
in tears and tantrums.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.339
Well, if he throws a tantrum,

03:29.383 --> 03:31.428
I will deal with it.

03:31.472 --> 03:34.257
I was talking about me.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.173
You've just committed
yourself to 48 hours of:

03:37.217 --> 03:38.827
"Dad. Dad.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.394
Dad. Dad."

03:40.437 --> 03:42.483
And I will
come back with,

03:42.526 --> 03:44.920
"What's up? I'm here.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.008
Let's rage."

03:46.051 --> 03:48.184
: Ho-ho.
Oh, don't worry.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.186
There will be rage.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.796
You know, I'm starting
to get the feeling

03:51.840 --> 03:53.450
that you don't think
I can do this.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.278
Don't take this the wrong
way, but if Icouldn't,

03:55.322 --> 03:57.454
you definitely can't.

03:57.498 --> 04:00.283
Ho-ho! Really?

04:00.327 --> 04:03.112
Well, what you don't realize
is I have something you don't.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.203
The mind of
an eight-year-old boy.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.814
Finally, something we agree on.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.732
Okay. We're off
to a great start.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.995
The TV in your waiting room
now gets more than one channel.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.997
Oh, great.
How did you do that?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.608
Well, not to get
too technical,

04:20.651 --> 04:23.045
but I put new batteries
in the remote.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.789
The remote? Calvin,
you told me it was stolen.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.094
Yeah.

04:29.138 --> 04:32.141
Uh, looks like
I fired Eduardo for nothing.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.927
Well, thanks for your help, man.

04:35.971 --> 04:38.365
Be sure to treat yourself
to a hard candy on the way out.

04:40.062 --> 04:42.325
Calvin, look. You may not
want Marty's help,

04:42.369 --> 04:45.110
but as the person who keeps
the books around here, I do.

04:45.154 --> 04:48.636
Well, fine. We're watching
Beverly Hills Cop IItonight.

04:48.679 --> 04:52.770
That's right. I used a
butter knife to get Part Iout.

04:52.814 --> 04:56.121
Okay, Marty, what's next?

04:56.165 --> 04:58.167
Well, let's take a look at
how you organize your invoices.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.604
Oh. Okay, everything's
stored right over here.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.954
Oh, file cabinet.
Old school.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.260
Nike.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.784
So, that's August 2012.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.049
This is how you
keep your records?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.443
How do you
keep anything organized?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.053
These are
barely receipts.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.534
"Herman, $200"?
What'd you do for Herman?

05:17.578 --> 05:19.144
It says it right here.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.146
$200 worth of work.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.628
Yeah, but,

05:24.672 --> 05:26.282
but what specifically
did you do?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.502
Well, if you
want to know that,

05:28.545 --> 05:30.112
then we gonna
have to call Eduardo.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.767
How do you say,

05:32.810 --> 05:34.725
"Oops, my bad"
in Spanish?

05:36.988 --> 05:38.816
That was so much fun.
What's next?

05:42.516 --> 05:46.128
Grover. We just did mini-golf,
batting cages,

05:46.171 --> 05:48.086
we even went to the dog park.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.349
We don't have a dog.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.482
Aren't you tired?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.441
Not at all.

05:54.484 --> 05:59.141
Ooh. I thought all that fetching
would tire you out.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.710
So, now what?

06:02.753 --> 06:04.451
How about this?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.191
How about we take
a five-minute break

06:06.235 --> 06:08.106
so Dad can rest his eyes?

06:08.150 --> 06:09.412
Okay.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.240
Whew...

06:12.850 --> 06:15.418
How will I know
when it's been five minutes?

06:15.462 --> 06:18.247
I'll tell you.

06:19.509 --> 06:20.597
How will youknow?

06:22.599 --> 06:24.166
Buddy...

06:24.209 --> 06:26.081
look around you. You
have all these toys.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.475
You've got a
big backyard.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.259
You've got a
room upstairs.

06:30.302 --> 06:34.002
Can you really find noway
to entertain yourself?

06:34.045 --> 06:36.178
I have an idea.Oh, good.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.658
Screen time!

06:38.615 --> 06:40.225
Grover!
Drop it!

06:40.269 --> 06:41.270
Bad boy!

06:43.098 --> 06:45.448
Sorry.
I'm still in dog park mode.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.320
Listen. Come
here, buddy.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.629
It would make
my life...

06:52.673 --> 06:56.067
so much easier

06:56.111 --> 06:57.286
if I gave this to you.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.157
I don't know, Dad.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.899
Trust your instincts.

07:01.943 --> 07:06.077
But Mom doesn't think that we
can go a few days without it.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.253
And I want to prove
to her that we can.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.213
Which is why...

07:11.256 --> 07:13.215
you're not gonna tell her
that I'm gonna let you

07:13.258 --> 07:14.999
play with this
for a few minutes.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.174
Yes!

07:16.218 --> 07:18.176
But remember,
we're not telling Mom.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.831
Mom who?Oh...

07:20.875 --> 07:23.617
Okay, Dad. I just finished
setting up your new system.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.184
This tablet controls
all your scheduling,

07:26.228 --> 07:27.969
estimates
and service notes.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.014
Does it have
Angry Birdson there?

07:31.363 --> 07:34.584
'Cause I love pissing off
them uppity pigs.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.021
Hey, Calvin.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.414
Hey, what's up, Roy?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.198
I got a text
saying my car was ready.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.765
I didn't text you.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.028
Uh, no.
But your new system did.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.030
I programmed it so when
a customer's car is ready,

07:46.074 --> 07:47.336
they get a notification.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.425
I didn't ask you to do all that.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.732
I'm not sure I'm
comfortable with my shop

07:51.775 --> 07:54.256
making its own
booty calls.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.998
Dad, trust me.
This is gonna make your business

07:57.041 --> 08:00.088
more efficient. See, customers
will be automatically billed,

08:00.131 --> 08:01.829
the payments go directly
into your account,

08:01.872 --> 08:04.222
and you don't have to call them
when their car is ready.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.834
Wait a minute.
So I get my money faster?

08:06.877 --> 08:10.228
And I don't have to talk
to chatterboxes like Roy?

08:11.186 --> 08:12.404
Hey.

08:12.448 --> 08:15.712
Roy, please.
I know more about your prostate

08:15.756 --> 08:18.149
than the doctor
who gave you the exam.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.199
So what
do you say, Dad?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.070
You want to give it
a shot?

08:26.114 --> 08:27.289
Why not?

08:27.332 --> 08:28.856
All right, great!
You'll see.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.248
This is gonna
make you leaner,

08:30.292 --> 08:32.773
meaner and rolling
in the greener.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.517
Boy, you may be smart, but
you couldn't wrap a burrito.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.480
Thanks for letting me have
screen time again today, Dad.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.004
I don't know,
maybe spaghetti?

08:48.397 --> 08:50.573
Uh-oh. Mom.
Mom's home.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.575
Uh, quick, hide this.

08:52.619 --> 08:53.750
Okay, but you hide this.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.973
Hey, guys.Oh, hey, Gem.
How was the retreat?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.322
Did you get your binder?

09:01.366 --> 09:02.803
I got two!

09:02.846 --> 09:04.587
Oh.

09:04.631 --> 09:08.025
Wow. It looks like
you two are having fun.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.766
You bet your binders we are.

09:11.289 --> 09:14.379
You know, I'm gonna take
this magazine to read upstairs.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.338
It's got something
really interesting in it.

09:19.341 --> 09:21.604
So, how long before you
gave him his screen back?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.084
Because if it was
under two hours,

09:23.127 --> 09:24.868
the choir teacher
owes me a hundred bucks.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.003
Well, I hate to disappoint you,

09:29.046 --> 09:31.309
but... we made it
the whole time.

09:31.353 --> 09:32.659
Really?

09:32.702 --> 09:34.225
Yup.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.444
And no tantrums?

09:35.487 --> 09:38.882
Not him. Not me.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.711
Wow. I'm impressed.

09:41.755 --> 09:44.366
Well, Gem, what you have
to understand is...

09:46.368 --> 09:48.457
...I'm kind of a Dad-ass.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.287
Come on, Calvin,
what's taking so long?

09:52.330 --> 09:54.332
I got a text an hour ago
that said my car was ready.

09:54.376 --> 09:57.031
Yeah, and you texted me
a selfie.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.423
Everybody
just calm down.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.251
I'm gonna get
to y'all in a minute.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.426
And you, you delete
that picture.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.993
I don't know you like that.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.432
All right. Okay,
I opened the customer profile,

10:07.476 --> 10:10.653
swiped to the diagnostic menu,

10:10.697 --> 10:12.481
clicked "payment."

10:12.524 --> 10:14.701
You just texted me
another selfie.

10:16.093 --> 10:18.095
Hey, Dad.
I just got your message.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.445
What's the problem?I'm gonna tell you
what the problem is.

10:20.489 --> 10:23.361
Your stupid system got me
sending pictures to dudes!

10:23.405 --> 10:25.886
Okay. There's nothing wrong
with the system.

10:25.929 --> 10:27.888
You must've made a mistake.You know, the only mistake

10:27.931 --> 10:29.367
I made was letting you
come up in here

10:29.411 --> 10:30.499
and mess up my business.

10:30.542 --> 10:32.457
Dad, calm down,
man, I'll fix it.

10:32.501 --> 10:34.590
No. I think you've fixed enough.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.852
I'm just trying
to help you.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.855
You want to help?
Get out of my shop,

10:38.899 --> 10:40.378
and take this thing
with you.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.730
Fine. You don't want my help?
Stay stuck in the past.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.601
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.690
I'm not stuck
in the past.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.039
All right,
y'all sit tight.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.215
I'm gonna go in here
and check my shoebox file.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.876
There you go, baby.Oh, thank you.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.225
Hey, I'm surprised
Marty's not here.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.879
He loves your waffles.

11:02.923 --> 11:06.187
He's not coming. He texted to
say he's too mad at your father.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.363
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.712
He don't know what he's missing,

11:09.756 --> 11:12.933
but, uh, he's about to.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.587
Ooh. Waffles.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.893
Hey.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.329
Those are my waffles.

11:18.373 --> 11:19.940
How could you treat
Marty like that?

11:19.983 --> 11:21.724
He was just trying to help.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.205
Well, all he did was make
things more complicated.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.903
By the time I figured out
how to charge Mrs. Perkins

11:26.947 --> 11:29.950
for her oil change, she
was due for another one.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.388
Yeah, Pop, if you're
not gonna upgrade,

11:33.431 --> 11:35.564
how do you expect
to compete with Motor Boys?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.087
Well, I'm glad you asked.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.394
You know, I spent
all night coming up

11:39.437 --> 11:41.744
with a brilliant
marketing strategy

11:41.788 --> 11:44.965
that is gonna bring in
tons of new business.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.053
Holla!

11:48.055 --> 11:51.580
Free tune-ups?
How can we afford to do that?

11:51.623 --> 11:54.148
Oh, it's easy.
Just read the fine print.

11:54.191 --> 11:58.021
"One free tune-up
after 15 at full price.

11:58.065 --> 12:01.024
Offer good for one week only"?

12:02.069 --> 12:03.766
That's pretty slick, huh?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.942
Believe what I tell you,

12:05.986 --> 12:09.859
Motor Boys is going down.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.861
So, that's your big plan?

12:11.905 --> 12:14.081
You gonna beat Motor Boys
by standing on the corner

12:14.124 --> 12:15.430
and spinning that sign?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.606
No. You are.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.790
Oh, hey, Gemma.
What's up?

12:27.834 --> 12:31.054
Not much. Just running some
errands, doing some shopping,

12:31.098 --> 12:32.752
wondering if I'm a terrible mom.

12:33.796 --> 12:34.884
What?

12:34.928 --> 12:36.886
Let me ask you something.Mm-hmm?

12:36.930 --> 12:39.584
Do you ever feel like Calvin's
a better parent than you?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.548
Girl, please. Right now he has
one son that's not talking

12:46.591 --> 12:49.333
to him and the other that's out
working the street corner.

12:49.377 --> 12:52.075
Sit down. Tell me
what's going on.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.556
Dave decided no screens
for Grover while I was gone,

12:54.599 --> 12:56.166
and it went great.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.082
But every time I've tried,
it's been a disaster.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.997
Oh, no. I'm sure
it wasn't that bad.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.000
Last time, I was so worn out,
I told Grover

13:04.044 --> 13:07.134
it was daylight savings
and sent him to bed at 3:00.

13:07.177 --> 13:10.006
Well, girl, that's nothing.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.400
Back when the boys were younger,
we used to play hide-and-seek.

13:12.443 --> 13:15.142
And the boys would search
around the house for an hour,

13:15.185 --> 13:17.318
while I'd be napping in the car.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.277
Well, Dave doesn't
need any naps.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.627
Grover hasn't had a screen
in almost three days,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.586
and he hasn't broken a sweat.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.022
Three days, huh?

13:26.066 --> 13:28.416
Hmm. Well, then, why are

13:28.459 --> 13:31.114
Grover and I playing
Words with Friendsright now?

13:33.116 --> 13:35.075
Unbelievable.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.294
I know. What kind
of freaky eight-year-old

13:37.338 --> 13:41.081
knows the word "cacophony"?

13:42.343 --> 13:44.432
Hey, Calvin's Pit Stop.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.173
We got free tune-ups.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.827
Well, kind of.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.526
Malcolm, what the hell, man?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.223
You've been out here,
like, two hours

13:53.267 --> 13:55.835
and not a single new customer's
come into the shop.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.881
How is that my fault?
Look, nobody's paying attention.

13:58.925 --> 14:02.015
That's 'cause you're
spinning the sign wrong.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.930
Look, you need to put
some stank on it.

14:05.148 --> 14:06.454
Pop, the sign
is not the problem.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.716
If you want to help
your business,

14:07.759 --> 14:09.283
you need to listen to Marty.

14:09.326 --> 14:12.199
Oh...And maybe apologize to him
while you're at it.

14:12.242 --> 14:16.377
He needs to be apologizing to me
for messing up my shop.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.510
Now give me this. Let me
show you how to do this, man.

14:19.554 --> 14:21.773
You got to get down with it.
See that? Look at that.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.253
Look at that-- spin that.
Whoo!

14:25.255 --> 14:26.169
Look at that. Look at that.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.388
For example,
see, check this out.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.568
Whoa! I killed it right there.

14:33.611 --> 14:36.049
Look at that.
Back at it, back around.

14:36.092 --> 14:39.052
Up, up, you flip it, then you,
like, ride it. Like that.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.880
Look at that.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.577
I killed that. You like that?

14:42.620 --> 14:43.883
Check this out
right here.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.101
Oh...

14:49.279 --> 14:51.238
You know what? On second
thought, maybe it's a good time

14:51.281 --> 14:53.022
to talk to Marty.
Yeah.

14:57.287 --> 14:58.723
Quick, Mom's home.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.074
Oh, what's that, bud?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.771
I'm the best dad of all time?

15:02.814 --> 15:04.251
Come here.

15:06.209 --> 15:09.125
Oh, hey, Gem,
I didn't see you there.

15:09.169 --> 15:12.128
Hmm. You probably didn't hear me
come in with all the noise.

15:12.172 --> 15:15.262
Some might call it a cacophony.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.918
I'll be upstairs.

15:21.181 --> 15:23.966
So, what'd you two
do while I was gone?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.446
Well, all kinds of stuff.

15:25.489 --> 15:29.145
We built Legos, read books,
played board games.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.886
Really? Which ones?

15:30.930 --> 15:34.107
Sorry? Risk? Trouble?

15:35.282 --> 15:36.805
You know, all of them.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.287
What was that?

15:41.636 --> 15:45.335
It sounds like, uh,
my toast is ready.

15:45.379 --> 15:48.164
Ooh, I could go
for some toast right now.

15:48.208 --> 15:49.731
Ooh.

15:49.774 --> 15:53.343
Darn it. You know,
I forgot to put the bread in.

15:58.740 --> 16:02.309
Well, look at that. Grover was
playing Wordswith Tina.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.659
What?

16:07.357 --> 16:09.403
When did he-- Huh.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.188
That little stinker.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.061
Dave, give it up.
I know you gave him screen time.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.410
Okay.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.238
You're right. Sorry.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.283
It's just that when you said
that I couldn't do it,

16:20.327 --> 16:22.111
it made me want to do it.

16:22.155 --> 16:25.332
And then when I was doing it,
I realized I couldn't do it.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.727
And your solution
was to lie to me?

16:29.771 --> 16:32.208
You made me feel
like a terrible mom.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.819
You are not a terrible mom.
You're a great mom.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.256
Uh-- You're the best mom.

16:36.299 --> 16:39.215
Sometimes I wish
you were my mom.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.435
Well, then, why didn't
you just tell me the truth?

16:41.478 --> 16:44.916
Well, because I was
disappointed with myself.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.269
And I really liked you thinking
that I was this amazing dad.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.620
You are an amazing dad.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.404
But parenting is hard.

16:54.448 --> 16:58.104
And us not being honest with
each other just makes it harder.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.541
I know. I'm sorry.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.850
But I think you're right.
Grover probably

17:05.894 --> 17:08.244
does need to spend
less time on screens.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.725
Well, what do you think?
Like, an hour a day?

17:10.768 --> 17:12.292
That sounds about right.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.381
GROVER:
How about two?

17:15.686 --> 17:18.776
How about I put you
to bed at 3:00 again?

17:18.820 --> 17:21.431
GROVER:
I knew that wasn't
daylight savings.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.828
Ha, ha! Nice try, aliens.

17:26.871 --> 17:29.352
You thought you were slick, but
there is a new Galactic Sheriff

17:29.396 --> 17:31.398
in town, and his name is-- Oh!

17:31.441 --> 17:33.574
I died.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.447
Who is it?

17:37.491 --> 17:41.886
Hey, M-Marty, look,
I came by just to, uh...

17:41.930 --> 17:43.410
What are you doing?

17:43.453 --> 17:45.064
Playing a video game.

17:45.107 --> 17:50.417
Really? 'Cause you look
like Ray Charles trying to ski.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.984
Look, I get it.
You think technology is stupid.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.986
But I'm kind of
in the middle of something,

17:55.030 --> 17:57.728
so feel free to grab
a hard candy on your way out.

18:02.646 --> 18:03.908
Okay.

18:05.301 --> 18:07.129
CALVIN:
Whoa.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.913
MARTY:
Dad? Is that you?

18:08.957 --> 18:12.787
What is all this
stupid space crap?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.919
It's you.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.486
Hey, look, son...

18:16.530 --> 18:18.445
Dad, if you want to talk,
you got to shoot some aliens.

18:18.488 --> 18:21.187
There's a button on
your right controller...

18:21.230 --> 18:22.579
Whoa, you really seem to know

18:22.623 --> 18:23.885
what you're doing
with that blaster.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.321
Of course I do.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.931
I'm from the streets, Marty.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.325
So, now what?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.457
Well, we want to take cover

18:30.500 --> 18:32.154
before more Kurblock drones
find us.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.374
Follow me.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.338
So, son, about
what happened at the shop,

18:42.382 --> 18:44.340
I know you were
only trying to help,

18:44.384 --> 18:48.344
but all your new technology
is too much change for me.

18:48.388 --> 18:49.911
Look out. Laser arrows!

18:52.827 --> 18:55.786
Damn, these Kurblocks
don't play.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.355
Look, I know change
is hard for you,

18:59.399 --> 19:01.183
but I've seen you do
it plenty of times.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
First you resist,
but once you buy in,

19:03.446 --> 19:05.970
you wonder what
took you so long.Like when?

19:06.014 --> 19:08.016
Like when you refused to
give up your flip phone.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.453
I loved that thing.

19:10.497 --> 19:15.110
When you slammed it shut, people
knew you hung up on their ass.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.373
Yeah, but when you finally
got your smartphone,

19:17.417 --> 19:19.593
you realized how
much better it was.

19:19.636 --> 19:21.377
And how about when Mom
wanted to get a new mattress

19:21.421 --> 19:23.118
but you didn't want
memory foam?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.815
I didn't like the idea of my bed

19:24.859 --> 19:27.601
remembering what I did
in it the night before.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.734
Yeah, but what happened that
first night you slept on it?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.519
It was great.

19:32.562 --> 19:36.523
I slept so hard my left arm
didn't wake up for a week.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.046
Exactly. I'm telling you,

19:38.089 --> 19:39.656
if you give this
new system a chance,

19:39.700 --> 19:41.876
you're gonna pick it up
faster than you think.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.312
Maybe you're right.

19:43.356 --> 19:47.316
I am one of the smartest people
I know.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.928
See? No one believes
in you more than you.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.409
Thanks, son. Come on.

19:53.453 --> 19:55.498
Bring it in.

19:58.806 --> 20:01.330
Oh, Dad, look out!

20:03.202 --> 20:04.551
Kurblock, please.

20:04.594 --> 20:05.465
Whoo!

20:09.382 --> 20:12.689
MARTY:
And that's why, in the year
3215, the Galactic Assembly

20:12.733 --> 20:14.343
exiled the Vortulons from
the Andromeda Compact.

20:14.387 --> 20:17.346
Although, there were
some economic factors

20:17.390 --> 20:19.740
that played into...CALVIN: Marty.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.264
What part of "the streets"
don't you get?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.485
I'm just here
to blast these fools.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.226
DAVE:
Oh, hey, guys.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.491
Dave? Are you in
Marty's apartment, too?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.493
No, I'm at Best Buy.

20:33.536 --> 20:36.539
Now that I'm back on screens,
I'm checking out VR headsets.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.194
Wait your turn, kid.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.544
Well, since you're here,

20:41.588 --> 20:43.372
you want to help us
take out some aliens?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.287
Actually, I came
for a new vacuum.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.333
What do you guys think?
Do I go modern upright

20:47.376 --> 20:49.248

20:49.291 --> 20:53.208

20:53.252 --> 20:56.298
Dave, watch out!
Incoming!

20:56.342 --> 20:57.995
I don't see anybody.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.388
I was talking about me.
