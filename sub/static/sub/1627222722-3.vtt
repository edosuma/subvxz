01:20.998 --> 01:21.999
Josh.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.626
Yes?

01:26.003 --> 01:27.462
What are you doing out here?

01:28.213 --> 01:29.381
I'm here for my mother.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.718
I know. I mean, come on in.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.890
We haven't met.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.810
No. I mean, I know you from the pictures,

01:41.894 --> 01:43.270
and your mom's told me all about you.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.980
-You want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.190
Well, sit down.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.734
But don't sit in that one.
That's the broken one.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.069
I know which one is the broken one,
thanks.

01:53.405 --> 01:56.867
There's one for my heart
and one for my prostate cancer.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.329
I'm sorry.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.332
It's fine. I barely have it.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.334
Doesn't affect my sex life.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.002
That's great.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.253
It's great to finally meet you.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.381
What's Ruth told you about me?

02:12.090 --> 02:13.467
Nothing.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.514
That's hilarious. That's so her.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.474
It's not really.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.434
Sure it is. You know her.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.560
I thought I did.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.605
Why are you so early?

02:26.688 --> 02:28.982
I just didn't wanna hit traffic.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.985
All right.
Well, I'll go get myself together.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.031
Look at her go.

02:45.123 --> 02:47.334
Why are you driving so slowly?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.966
I told you I had a few panic attacks.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.217
I thought you were better.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.469
I am. This is me better. But I just--

02:57.553 --> 02:59.596
Some things make me
a little extra anxious.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.931
Like driving on the freeway,

03:01.014 --> 03:02.724
which, by the way,
is a legitimately dangerous thing.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.685
Everybody should be anxious
driving on the freeway.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.603
-It's just we're all used to it.
-Right.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.983
Well, guess it doesn't matter
how slowly you drive

03:11.066 --> 03:13.694
because you showed up at my house
so early.

03:16.238 --> 03:20.075
So, how did you and Larry meet?

03:20.158 --> 03:23.370
Well, it's nothing serious
if that's what you're asking.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.455
But how long have you been dating?

03:27.249 --> 03:28.250
About a year.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.334
What?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.545
Don't make a big deal out of this.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.549
That's crazy.
We usually tell each other things.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.301
You don't tell me everything.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.594
I tell you a lot.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.138
A year.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.516
So, what,
you started seeing him last October?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.727
-Yes. You had just broken up with Megan…
-Right.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.395
…so you were feeling delicate.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.148
I just decided to wait
until you got a little stronger.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.358
Well, it's been a year.
Have I gotten a little stronger?

03:53.942 --> 03:57.362
You know you don't do well
when other people are happy.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.864
I don't know that.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.827
Well, none of us do, but you just
have it worse than the rest of us.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.330
Wow.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.876
Look, how were you
when your sister married Aaron?

04:10.959 --> 04:13.670
-I was very happy for her.
-No, you thought she could do better.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.922
Well…

04:15.005 --> 04:17.382
But I don't know
why you hate Aaron so much.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.884
I don't hate Aaron. He's fine.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.844
And what's wrong with being fine?

04:20.928 --> 04:21.928
Nothing.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.807
I think it's because he's so religious.
You're anti-Semitic.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.018
I'm half Jewish.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.353
You're half anti-Semitic.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.396
That's a serious accusation to make.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.024
-Don't be overly sensitive.
-I'm not being overly sensitive.

04:34.107 --> 04:38.946
I can be critical of organized religion
without being labeled an anti-Semite.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.492
Yeah, I'm proud of being a Jew.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.285
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.370
How so?

04:46.870 --> 04:49.164
-"How so"?
-Yeah. I'd like to hear this.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.124
How are you proud of being Jewish?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.626
I'm proud of…

04:54.169 --> 04:58.924
Bob Dylan, and the Coen brothers,
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

04:59.007 --> 05:00.843
-and brisket and tzimmes.
-You should stop.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.928
-You sound ridiculous.
-Fine, but it's not the point.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.055
My problem with Beth
isn't that she's religious,

05:05.138 --> 05:06.765
it's that she's a control freak.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.141
I've said this many times.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.935
She married a religious man

05:10.018 --> 05:12.437
because she thinks
it will help her stay in control.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.940
But the truth is,
you can't control everything,

05:15.023 --> 05:18.861
and that's why she's--
That's why she's always unhappy.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.865
Are you sure she's the unhappy one?

05:25.909 --> 05:28.245
Could we pull over somewhere?
I have to pee now.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.831
-Can you wait until we get there?
-We're only halfway there.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.541
That's 'cause
Aaron had the great idea to move

05:32.624 --> 05:34.459
-all the way out to Valencia.
-Oh, God.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.129
If you were driving faster,
we'd be there by now.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.045
Well, I feel a million times better.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.129
Good.

06:20.923 --> 06:23.383
Did Elizabeth tell you
what to get for Sara?

06:23.467 --> 06:24.468
Yeah.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.347
Me too, yeah.
She even told me where to buy it.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.807
I thought part of the fun was
picking the gift out.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.227
Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying.
She's a control freak.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.854
Well, you're not wrong about that.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.529
Look, I'm happy you met someone.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.614
Well, thank you.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.115
It's been a while.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.785
Hasn't been that long a while.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.870
It has. But so what?

06:53.247 --> 06:54.665
I guess you're right.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.585
I've been very unlucky with men.

06:59.878 --> 07:00.879
I didn't say that.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.091
No, I have been. Very unlucky.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.680
I have been.
What is that supposed to mean?

07:09.763 --> 07:13.141
I don't know.
Was it luck or was it your choices?

07:16.395 --> 07:18.939
Your father was very different
when I met him.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.983
He didn't have
all the problems he had later.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.861
Or he did,
and you just chose not to see them.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.405
I think you remember him
as worse than he really was.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.739
Okay.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.033
He never hit you.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.744
That depends on
your definition of hitting.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.454
You were never in any danger.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.082
-We were absolutely in danger.
-When?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.750
How about anytime he drove a car?

07:38.834 --> 07:40.460
Why do you think
I'm such a nervous driver?

07:40.544 --> 07:42.546
You're just talking about
that one time when--

07:42.629 --> 07:44.173
No. Many, many times.

07:44.256 --> 07:46.258
Or how about the time
he almost burned the house down?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.886
-He didn't almost burn the house down.
-A fire truck came.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.013
They used their hoses and things.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.557
I'm just saying.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.310
You got to choose Dad, I didn't.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.229
So, you know, maybe I'm the unlucky one.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.444
Well, that's a very hurtful thing
to say to me.

08:09.364 --> 08:10.824
How do you think it feels

08:10.908 --> 08:13.827
to know that your son blames you
for his miserable life?

08:13.911 --> 08:17.247
I'm not miserable. I didn't say that.

08:17.331 --> 08:19.541
You might not have meant to, but you did.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.023
-Do you want me to--
-No, I'm fine.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.528
Hello?

08:50.739 --> 08:52.324
Hello?

08:52.407 --> 08:54.243
-Mom?
-Hello.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.495
-Hey!
-Hi.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.746
Here you go.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.666
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

09:00.749 --> 09:01.750
Thank you.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.670
You both got Sara exactly what I asked.

09:04.753 --> 09:05.754
Yeah, you told us to.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.924
Yeah. You know, sometimes
people resent being asked what to get.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.008
-Really?
-No.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.927
We enjoyed getting you
just what you asked for--

09:12.010 --> 09:13.053
-Punch buggy!
-Okay.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.888
-David!
-What's punch buggy?

09:15.556 --> 09:17.140
It's a game he's been playing.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.433
-Is it a game?
-Yeah.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.104
I have no idea what the rules are,
but he thinks it's hilarious.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.689
-It is something.
-Okay.

09:23.772 --> 09:24.898
-It's not nothing.
-Okay.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.233
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.818
-Hello.
-Hey. Hi.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.404
-I love what you did with your hair.
-Hey.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.488
Mrs. Nover?

09:31.572 --> 09:33.949
-Same haircut I always get.
-Someone's crying outside.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.201
-Maybe they lost at punch buggy.
-Oh, shit. Fuck.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.495
Sorry, Abby.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.039
Mom, if maybe you could
plate the crudités,

09:41.123 --> 09:43.083
that would be a big help, yeah?

09:44.209 --> 09:45.627
Can you show me?

09:46.712 --> 09:49.047
-So, how you doing?
-Good, man. What's going on with you?

09:49.131 --> 09:50.299
Not much, not much.

09:50.382 --> 09:54.386
Just got the new car.
You probably saw it when you came in.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.182
It's in the driveway. It's a green Subaru.

09:58.265 --> 10:02.186
Right on. Sorry, yeah,
I'm just bad at noticing cars.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.021
I notice them when I'm driving, but…

10:04.605 --> 10:07.191
Yeah. You wanna come see it?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.068
-Yeah, sure.
-Sure? I mean, you don't have to.

10:10.152 --> 10:12.029
-No, I could see it.
-Nah, it's fine.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.990
-I'll see it on the way out then.
-Great.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.326
-Let me know if you want me to open it up.
-Yeah, cool.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.827
Cool. Good.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.204
Aaron!

10:21.288 --> 10:22.456
-I gotta go.
-Yep.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.421
I love Costco hummus.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.882
-Josh.
-What? I do.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.972
Do you see how much time they let him
have on that thing? It's not okay.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.517
Did you see his eyes? It's scary.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.811
You played just as many video games
when you were his age.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.648
I mean, for hours you would sit
in front of that screen.

10:48.232 --> 10:49.525
And you turned out fine.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.609
Did I?

10:50.692 --> 10:52.569
-Are you done?
-What? I'm just concerned for him.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.279
-No, you are not.
-What makes you say that?

10:54.363 --> 10:56.031
You have always
had something against David.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.366
I don't have anything against David.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.159
-He's just a bad person.
-He's seven!

10:59.243 --> 11:01.411
Yeah, but you can be a bad person
when you're seven.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.372
Doesn't mean you'll stay a bad person.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.542
Although I wouldn't really bet on David,
especially if they--

11:06.625 --> 11:08.961
-They keep letting him play--
-These tomatoes are bad.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.857
Is there an owl in the backyard?

11:29.940 --> 11:30.941
-Yes!
-There is.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.901
-We have to do something about this owl.
-Yes.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.904
I'm awake in the daytime even though
I have daytime in the nighttime.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.616
I know, yeah. Last time we had
that conversation about owls,

11:39.700 --> 11:42.786
and in the daytime, they're asleep,
but in the nighttime, they hunt.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.705
Yes,

11:44.788 --> 11:47.958
But I wanna hunt.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.794
So I wanna fly, and I wanna hunt
for a mouse for my dinner.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.296
-You wanna fly right now?
-Yeah.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.755
Okay. Ready? Let's go.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.800
Okay. She's flying.

11:56.884 --> 12:01.847
She's flying over the prairie.
She's looking for a mouse.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.432
-There's one! That way!
-Which way?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.517
-Inside.
-Inside. Okay, here we go.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.394
Okay. Which way?

12:07.477 --> 12:08.937
-Upstairs.
-Up here?

12:09.021 --> 12:10.063
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.234
And she landed.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.279
You gonna catch the mouse?

12:17.362 --> 12:18.488
Got it.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.949
Now it's time to eat the mouse for dinner.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.534
Okay, it's dinnertime.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.371
How was it?

12:26.872 --> 12:30.042
Good, but why does the owl eat the mouse?

12:30.125 --> 12:31.585
I guess 'cause she was hungry.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.920
Why?

12:33.003 --> 12:34.963
Well, same reason you get hungry.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.799
You gotta eat to keep living.
Your body's built out of food.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.092
Why?

12:39.176 --> 12:44.348
Because food has
all kinds of nutrients and proteins.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.724
-Why?
-Why?

12:46.600 --> 12:47.976
That's a good question.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.687
Is it because that's just
how God made the world?

12:54.650 --> 12:55.776
Where'd you hear that?

12:55.859 --> 12:56.860
Is it?

12:57.903 --> 13:01.240
Was someone telling you the story about
how God created the world in seven days?

13:01.323 --> 13:02.950
It's not a story.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.118
-It's not?
-No!

13:05.202 --> 13:07.162
-Is that funny?
-Yeah.

13:07.246 --> 13:09.540
Okay, can I ask you a question?
Have you ever seen God?

13:09.623 --> 13:10.707
-Yeah.
-You have?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.167
Yeah. Have you ever seen him?

13:12.668 --> 13:13.794
No.

13:13.877 --> 13:14.878
Why?

13:17.256 --> 13:19.091
Well, I haven't seen him in real life,

13:19.174 --> 13:21.969
but that doesn't mean
that you can't still see him.

13:22.678 --> 13:23.762
Why?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.224
Why?

13:27.307 --> 13:32.354
Because… Well, God is sort of like
the mouse you just ate for dinner.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.857
-It's pretend, but it can feel real.
-Josh.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.234
Hi.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.569
Hey.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.821
Sweetie, your friends are all
looking for you outside.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.531
Why don't you say goodbye to Uncle Josh?

13:42.614 --> 13:44.825
Okay. Bye, Uncle Josh.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.076
Bye, darling.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.673
-Go away.
-Can we just talk for a second?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.216
No, not now.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.265
You ever see that blog,
Things Organized Neatly?

14:09.641 --> 14:10.642
Nope.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.813
What are you looking for?

14:18.942 --> 14:20.152
Birthday napkins.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.029
I don't need help.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.363
"Miscellaneous"?

14:23.947 --> 14:25.449
Goddamn it.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.374
-Look, I'm sorry.
-No, you're not, Josh.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.503
If you were sorry, you wouldn't have
done it in the first place.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.296
We were just having a conversation.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.550
Telling a five-year-old
that God isn't real is not a conversation.

14:43.634 --> 14:46.178
That's you imposing
your ideas on my daughter.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.306
She asked me if I had ever seen him.
What, was I supposed to lie?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.933
It's not a lie.

14:51.016 --> 14:52.434
It would be if I said it.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.604
You can tell a child a story
and let them believe it

14:55.687 --> 14:57.189
without it having to be true.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.399
So you don't even think
it's true that God is real,

14:59.483 --> 15:00.984
but you want me to tell Sara--

15:01.068 --> 15:02.277
Of course I believe in God.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.571
I'm trying to be respectful of
the fact that you don't.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.032
No one else is here.
You can tell me what you really think.

15:10.244 --> 15:11.870
That is what I really think.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.958
-And if you hadn't married Aaron, then--
-But I did.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.919
You can be so dumb sometimes.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.547
-Honestly, you think you know everything.
-I don't think I know everything.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.590
-You think you know everything.
-I think I know everything?

15:23.674 --> 15:25.050
Yeah. You think
you have it all figured out.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.428
There's this old man up in the sky,
and as long as you follow his rules,

15:28.512 --> 15:30.514
then everything just stays under control.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.266
Yeah. I guess, you know,

15:32.349 --> 15:35.477
it's easier if things were out of control,
because then nothing's your fault.

15:38.313 --> 15:43.277
You think the entire world is chaos
because our lives were chaos.

15:44.278 --> 15:45.487
And yours still is.

15:47.281 --> 15:51.493
Happy birthday to you

15:52.035 --> 15:55.956
Happy birthday to you

15:56.456 --> 16:01.086
Happy birthday, dear Sara

16:01.628 --> 16:06.175
Happy birthday to you

16:10.179 --> 16:11.180
Bye, honey.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.765
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks.

16:13.849 --> 16:15.851
Goodbye, young man. Behave.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.686
-Thanks, Ruth.
-Night, Aaron.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.981
-All right. Bye, sweetie.
-Love you.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.859
-I love you.
-Love you too. Don't worry.

16:23.942 --> 16:24.943
Thanks.

16:37.539 --> 16:38.874
What's wrong with you?

16:53.305 --> 16:54.306
Look, I'm sorry.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.184
You're not sorry, okay?

16:57.267 --> 16:59.686
'Cause if you were sorry,
you wouldn't be this way.

16:59.770 --> 17:03.190
-I'm not trying to be any kind of way.
-Well, you're not trying not to be.

17:03.273 --> 17:06.484
-Sara asked me if I--
-It's Sara's fault now?

17:07.109 --> 17:09.738
You're gonna blame
your five-year-old niece for everything?

17:09.820 --> 17:13.575
Because earlier, everything that was
wrong with your life was my fault.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.868
-I didn't say that.
-You pretty much did.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.002
Do you know how many stupid books I read
on how to be a good parent?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.674
Yes. I remember the shelf.

17:28.757 --> 17:30.133
It was two shelves.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.348
Do you know how scared I was?

17:43.772 --> 17:47.276
But then you grew up, right?
You seemed okay.

17:47.818 --> 17:50.487
You acted like somebody who had
a good childhood.

17:51.697 --> 17:55.701
So I thought, well,
maybe it was a good childhood.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.787
I mean, it could have been better,
I understand.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.664
But it certainly could have been worse.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.043
I guess I just started
letting myself believe that…

18:07.671 --> 18:08.755
maybe I did it.

18:10.757 --> 18:15.429
Maybe that was the one thing in my life
I did that was truly worth something.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.556
I was a good mom to my kids.

18:19.933 --> 18:24.479
I guess I was just kidding myself
'cause I fucked that up too, evidently.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.898
Mom, I had a good childhood.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.400
Please don't say that
to make me feel better

18:28.483 --> 18:30.694
-because it just makes it worse.
-You're--

18:32.613 --> 18:33.864
You're a wonderful mom.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.491
-You always were.
-Please, stop. Please, just stop it.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.166
Look.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.085
I have to pee.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.381
Okay.

19:51.817 --> 19:53.318
What are you looking at?

19:56.738 --> 19:57.739
Nothing.

20:15.924 --> 20:20.262
When we met
I was younger

20:20.345 --> 20:23.807
Than a young thing can be

20:35.861 --> 20:39.781
You were wet
You were hungry

20:40.282 --> 20:43.118
You still needed me

20:43.994 --> 20:50.459
You said I could fly
And I flew

20:51.043 --> 20:54.087
I remember before you knew

20:54.171 --> 20:56.089
-You taught me to talk
-How to talk

20:57.966 --> 21:00.260
Now I talk like you do

21:01.803 --> 21:03.555
You taught me to see

21:03.639 --> 21:07.643
Not to see
But to really look deeper like you do

21:07.726 --> 21:12.189
I already knew you'd
Leave me someday

21:12.272 --> 21:15.150
With no cure
For the love that I had

21:15.234 --> 21:17.277
From the moment I heard

21:17.361 --> 21:21.615
-And from my first word, Mama
-Your first word, Mama

21:22.366 --> 21:25.661
You shaped the boy I'd become

21:26.370 --> 21:32.167
But the boy disappeared
Lost to the years

21:32.251 --> 21:36.463
And the man you became
Is a beautiful one

21:36.547 --> 21:42.302
Every bit still the same
Every bit still my son

21:43.428 --> 21:47.516
But, oh, here we go with our words

21:47.599 --> 21:51.144
And the battle's begun

21:51.228 --> 21:58.151
And when the dust settles
I'm sick as I see what I've done

21:58.861 --> 22:01.280
If I could just tell you that

22:01.363 --> 22:08.203
You more than deserve
Those three little words I can't find

22:08.996 --> 22:13.083
There is no other one

22:13.166 --> 22:17.087
-You are my mother
-You are my son

22:17.171 --> 22:19.214
You are mine

22:27.598 --> 22:30.434
At times you rile me up

22:31.268 --> 22:35.022
Just a little bit more than most do

22:36.273 --> 22:40.527
You get on my nerves
And I'm sure that I get on yours

22:40.611 --> 22:42.446
Surely we both do

22:42.529 --> 22:46.909
Aren't we supposed to
Say what we're feeling

22:46.992 --> 22:52.581
Instead, I'm concealing my heart
And just offering guile

22:53.999 --> 22:57.920
And when you smile
It's my reflection

22:59.379 --> 23:02.299
Mixed with everything I feel

23:02.382 --> 23:08.222
All of my flaws
Look what I've caused to appear

23:10.224 --> 23:15.020
Why can't I say
What you most need to hear?

23:15.687 --> 23:20.567
Don't leave me stuck in the dark, dear

23:31.036 --> 23:34.706
Oh, here we go with our words

23:34.790 --> 23:38.252
And the battle's begun

23:38.335 --> 23:45.300
And when the dust settles
I'm sick as I see what I've done

23:46.093 --> 23:48.345
If I could just tell you that

23:48.428 --> 23:52.057
You more than deserve

23:52.140 --> 23:56.854
Those three little words I can't find

23:57.437 --> 24:01.525
There is no other one

24:01.608 --> 24:05.320
-You are my mother
-You are my son

24:05.404 --> 24:08.115
You are mine

24:08.198 --> 24:10.284
If I could just tell you that--
