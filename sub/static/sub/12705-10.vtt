00:01.534 --> 00:03.903
JENNY:
 The curse. If Angel
 achieved true happiness,

00:03.936 --> 00:05.306
even just a moment...

00:05.339 --> 00:07.006
(thunder crashes)

00:07.041 --> 00:08.476
Aah

00:08.509 --> 00:09.910
...he would lose his soul.

00:09.942 --> 00:11.579
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

00:11.612 --> 00:13.381
(shrieks)
(chortles)

00:13.413 --> 00:14.682
BUFFY:
 This is it--

00:14.714 --> 00:16.750
the curse.
What are you saying?

00:16.783 --> 00:17.984
WILLOW:
 I may be able to work this.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.387
BUFFY:
 Willow cured him,

00:19.420 --> 00:21.422
and...and
 somehow,
 he came back.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.091
GILES:
 You must have known
 it was wrong, seeing Angel,

00:23.123 --> 00:24.324
or you wouldn't have hidden
it
from all of us.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.992
I just wanted to wait.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.228
For Angel to go psycho again
the next time

00:28.262 --> 00:29.896
you give him
a happy?

00:31.364 --> 00:33.334
(indistinct chatter)

00:33.366 --> 00:35.368
*

00:50.750 --> 00:52.552
(carriage bells jingling)

00:52.585 --> 00:55.122
* ...All is calm
*

00:55.155 --> 00:58.392
* All is bright

00:58.426 --> 01:02.130
* Round yon virgin

01:02.162 --> 01:04.165
* Mother and child...
Oh!
Now, watch it, son.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.370
ANGEL (Irish accent):
Why, Daniel...

01:10.403 --> 01:12.305
where were you going?
You...

01:12.340 --> 01:13.873
you're not human.

01:13.906 --> 01:15.543
Not of late, no.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.411
(whimpering):
Wh... what do you want?

01:17.444 --> 01:19.079
Well, it happens that
I'm hungry, Daniel,

01:19.112 --> 01:20.881
and seeing as
that
you're somewhat in me debt...

01:20.914 --> 01:22.049
Please, I can't.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.650
A man playing at cards

01:23.683 --> 01:25.218
should have
a natural intelligence

01:25.253 --> 01:26.719
or a great deal of money,

01:26.754 --> 01:28.489
and you're sadly lacking
in both.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.424
(snarls)

01:32.091 --> 01:34.728
So I take me winnings
me own way.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.096
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.497
I shall not want.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.667
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

01:39.700 --> 01:42.002
Daniel, be of good cheer.

01:42.034 --> 01:42.902
(whimpers)

01:42.936 --> 01:45.206
It's Christmas.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.710
(gasping)

01:51.811 --> 01:53.947
WEATHERMAN:
 It's going to be
 sunny and warm,

01:53.980 --> 01:56.150
with temperatures continuing
in the high 70s

01:56.183 --> 01:58.018
throughout the holiday weekend.

01:58.051 --> 02:01.254
* Remember Christ our Savior
*

02:01.289 --> 02:03.323
* Was born on Christmas Day

02:03.356 --> 02:05.593
SANTA: Merry Christmas!
* To save us all
from Satan's power *

02:05.626 --> 02:07.361
* When we were gone astray
Merry Christmas.

02:07.394 --> 02:11.431
* Oh, tidings of
comfort and joy... *

02:11.465 --> 02:13.200
Hi.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.203
Angel.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.373
So, are you shopping?

02:20.408 --> 02:23.110
You're probably not shopping.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.812
I couldn't sleep.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.713
Vampires probably not

02:26.747 --> 02:28.481
that big on Christmas,
now that I think about it.

02:28.515 --> 02:29.716
Not as a rule,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.384
no.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.989
But you're good?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.560
I'm-I'm all right.
You?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.329
Yeah.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.197
Yeah, I'm good.

02:43.230 --> 02:45.031
I, um, was just getting some

02:45.064 --> 02:47.033
Christmas gifts
for the gang.

02:47.067 --> 02:51.170
Um, I'd better go before
the magic store closes.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.877
Angel?

03:00.112 --> 03:01.782
What is it?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.588
(wolf howling)

03:08.622 --> 03:10.723
*

03:59.340 --> 04:01.308
(school bell ringing)

04:01.342 --> 04:03.343
(indistinct chatter)

04:05.579 --> 04:07.914
And then he just bailed.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.717
He didn't say anything.
He just took off.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.151
It was so weird.

04:11.183 --> 04:12.919
Angel? Weird?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.822
What are the odds?

04:14.854 --> 04:16.255
Do you think
something's wrong?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.925
Maybe you should
tell
Giles.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.795
No. I don't want
to bug Giles.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.230
He's still kind of twitchy

04:23.262 --> 04:25.098
when it comes to
the subject of Angel.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.634
Well, it must be that whole

04:26.667 --> 04:28.401
"Angel killed his girlfriend
and tortured him" thing.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.637
Giles is pretty petty

04:29.670 --> 04:31.170
when it comes to
stuff like that.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.673
Xander, enough, okay?

04:33.706 --> 04:36.476
Maybe Angel just has
the holiday blues.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.911
Everybody gets them,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.447
especially
when
they're alone.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.949
It's just so
frustrating.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.817
I'm trying
to do the right thing

04:44.851 --> 04:46.786
and stay away from him

04:46.819 --> 04:48.021
and get over it,

04:48.055 --> 04:51.091
and then boom,
there he is.

04:51.124 --> 04:55.262
I just want a nice,
quiet Christmas vacation.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.365
XANDER: So, you doing
anything special?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.468
BUFFY: Tree. Nog.
Roast beast.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.870
Just me and Mom

05:02.903 --> 05:04.137
and hopefully
an excess of gifts.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.005
What are you doing
for Christmas?

05:06.038 --> 05:08.108
Being Jewish.
Remember, people?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.276
Not everybody
worships
Santa.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.680
I just meant
for vacation.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.213
Nothing fun.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.817
Oz and I had planned...

05:16.850 --> 05:19.853
but I guess that's off.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.187
Well, I'll be enjoying

05:21.221 --> 05:23.055
my annual
Christmas
Eve campout.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.492
See, I
take
my sleeping bag
outside

05:25.526 --> 05:27.326
and I go to sleep
on the grass.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.795
BUFFY:
Sounds
fun.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.029
Yeah, I like to look
at the stars, you know?

05:30.062 --> 05:31.298
Feel the whole nature vibe.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.233
CORDELIA:
I thought you slept outside

05:33.266 --> 05:35.903
to avoid your family's
drunken Christmas fights.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.172
Yes, and that was a
confidence

05:39.206 --> 05:41.007
I was hoping you would share
with everyone.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.843
Well, I'll be
in Aspen,

05:42.875 --> 05:45.012
skiing,

05:45.045 --> 05:46.514
with actual snow.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.348
I hear that
helps.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.018
It must be a drag to be
stuck here in Sweatydale,

05:51.050 --> 05:52.720
but I'm thinking of you.

05:52.752 --> 05:55.254
Okay, I'm done.

05:55.288 --> 05:58.591
She certainly has
reverted to form.
WILLOW:
It's not her fault.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.093
After what happened,

06:01.127 --> 06:03.163
we gotta cut her some slack.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.165
That's the Christmas spirit.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.867
Hello, still
Jewish.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.369
Chanukah spirit,
I believe that was?

06:09.403 --> 06:11.439
Anyway, forgiveness
is pretty much

06:11.471 --> 06:13.173
a big theme
with me this year,

06:13.206 --> 06:15.041
'cause of the...

06:20.146 --> 06:21.380
Hey.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.783
Hey

06:23.817 --> 06:25.384
OZ:
 Okay.

06:25.418 --> 06:27.821
The thing is...

06:29.923 --> 06:32.659
Seeing you with Xander,
it was...

06:34.827 --> 06:37.730
Well, I never
felt
that way before

06:37.764 --> 06:41.134
when there wasn't a full
moon,

06:41.168 --> 06:43.302
but I know you guys
have a history.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.305
But it's a history
that's in the
past.

06:46.338 --> 06:50.276
Well, I-I guess most
history is in the
past.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.446
But it's over.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.781
Well, I don't know.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.651
I don't know that it
ever will be,

06:57.685 --> 06:59.819
between you two.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.788
Oz, please believe me.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.857
This is what I do know.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.360
I miss you.

07:09.529 --> 07:11.298
Like, every second.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.002
It's like I lost an arm.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.004
Or worse, a-a torso.

07:20.473 --> 07:23.009
So...

07:23.043 --> 07:25.612
I think I'd be willing to...

07:25.646 --> 07:28.014
give it a shot.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.853
Really?

07:36.856 --> 07:38.457
Yeah.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.466
Do you want us
to...
to hug now?

07:48.668 --> 07:51.471
Yeah, I'm good for that.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.853
("Joy to the World" plays
over tinny speakers)

08:05.886 --> 08:07.153
WOMAN:
Take the other one, then.

08:13.425 --> 08:16.362
Do you want to get one
with snow on it?

08:16.396 --> 08:17.531
It'd be very Christmasy.

08:17.564 --> 08:20.466
I think those are
just for display.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.370
Oh. You know,
honey,
I was thinking

08:24.403 --> 08:26.005
maybe we should
invite Faith

08:26.038 --> 08:27.374
to spend
Christmas Eve with us.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.908
I don't know.

08:28.942 --> 08:33.013
Faith and I don't
really hang
out

08:33.046 --> 08:36.414
or talk or
make
eye contact
lately.

08:36.448 --> 08:39.385
Do you really want to let
her spend Christmas Eve

08:39.418 --> 08:42.522
all by herself in that
dingy little motel room?

08:42.556 --> 08:46.058
You're still number one
with a guilt trip, Mom.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.595
I try.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.328
I'll ask her.

08:49.361 --> 08:51.565
You're a
doll.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.332
What about Giles? I mean,
he doesn't have any fam...

08:53.365 --> 08:55.235
No, I'm sure he's fine.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.836
We could at least
ask him and see...

08:56.870 --> 08:58.538
He doesn't want to
spend Christmas Eve

08:58.572 --> 09:00.039
with a bunch of girls.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.307
Let's split up.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.113
(exhales)

09:10.650 --> 09:12.653
*

09:30.269 --> 09:32.773
Bunch of them up and died on us.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.774
Don't know
why.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.942
If you want one,

09:34.975 --> 09:37.543
I can make you a
hell of a
deal.

09:37.576 --> 09:39.245
No, thank
you.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.280
JOYCE:
Oh, honey,
this one's perfect.

09:44.684 --> 09:47.453
(men chanting)

09:56.697 --> 09:59.131
(gasping)

10:07.206 --> 10:08.642
Merry Christmas...
(knock at door)

10:08.676 --> 10:10.143
Happy New Year...
Yeah?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.681
MAN:
God bless us, every...
Hey, what's up?

10:13.714 --> 10:16.015
Work, damn it!

10:16.048 --> 10:17.549
Hey

10:19.385 --> 10:21.488
What's going on?

10:21.520 --> 10:23.155
Scary monsters?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.557
Nope.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.864
We're having Christmas Eve
dinner at my
house,

10:30.898 --> 10:32.966
and I thought
that, um,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.201
if you didn't
have plans...

10:34.234 --> 10:36.669
Your mom sent you down, huh?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.538
No.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.774
Well, thanks,
but I got plans.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.442
There's this big party

10:42.475 --> 10:44.311
I've been invited to.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.046
It should be a blast.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.316
Okay. Cool.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.384
But if you change
your mind, the offer...

10:51.418 --> 10:52.652
That's nice of you.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.486
Thanks.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.490
But I got...
I got that big party

10:57.524 --> 11:00.226
that I've been
invited to, so...

11:06.533 --> 11:08.567
I like the lights.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.471
Yeah. Well, 'tis the season,

11:11.504 --> 11:13.605
whatever that means.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.078
(knocking at
door)

11:19.111 --> 11:20.379
Just a minute.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.688
Hello.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.825
Um...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.559
I'm sorry
to bother you.

11:33.592 --> 11:35.195
(exhales)

11:35.227 --> 11:37.563
(laughs)

11:37.596 --> 11:39.665
Sorry. Sorry,
coming from you,

11:39.698 --> 11:41.701
that phrase strikes me
as rather funny.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.269
Sorry to bother me.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.504
I need your help.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.538
And the funny keeps on
coming.

11:46.572 --> 11:50.243
I understand I have
no right to ask for it,

11:50.277 --> 11:51.912
but there's no one else.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.615
All right.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.557
I-I can't come in
unless you invite me.

12:04.591 --> 12:07.460
I'm aware of
that.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.663
Come in.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.974
I've been
seeing...

12:21.008 --> 12:24.244
I've... I've had
dreams,
lately,

12:24.277 --> 12:25.812
about the
past.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.448
It's... It's like
I'm living it again.

12:29.481 --> 12:30.783
It's so vivid, I...

12:30.817 --> 12:33.586
I need to know.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.822
I need to know why I'm here.

12:35.855 --> 12:37.323
Here?

12:37.356 --> 12:38.725
Back on Earth?

12:38.758 --> 12:41.394
I should be in a demon dimension

12:41.427 --> 12:43.596
suffering an eternity
of torture.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.432
I don't feel particularly
inclined to argue with that.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.433
But I'm not.

12:47.466 --> 12:49.469
I was freed,

12:49.501 --> 12:51.471
and I don't understand why.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.440
Knowing why you were back
would give you peace of mind?

12:53.472 --> 12:55.508
It might.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.977
Do you think that's something
you ought to have?

12:58.010 --> 13:00.480
Because, sir,
to be blunt,

13:00.513 --> 13:03.750
the last time you became
complacent about your existence

13:03.783 --> 13:05.852
turned out rather badly.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.658
What?
ANGEL:
There...

13:13.393 --> 13:15.162
Don't you see
her?

13:15.195 --> 13:16.462
Who?

13:22.568 --> 13:23.836
I... I can't!

13:29.208 --> 13:32.011
*

13:37.384 --> 13:39.351
(indistinct conversation)

13:39.385 --> 13:41.388
(elegant music playing)

13:47.094 --> 13:50.129
MAN:
Well, um, it's
nice
to be back in London.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.398
(laughter)

13:54.767 --> 13:58.071
Sir, please, I-I should
return to the party.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.706
Margaret, Margaret,
there's no hurry.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.307
Mistress will
be wondering...

14:01.341 --> 14:04.311
Shh. Mistress will be
wondering how to get

14:04.344 --> 14:05.711
the good Reverend Chalmers
into bed

14:05.745 --> 14:08.847
and will not notice
the absence of canapés.

14:08.881 --> 14:10.182
Ah. Stay with me.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.351
Sir, people might talk.

14:12.384 --> 14:15.221
I'll be put out in the streets.

14:15.254 --> 14:18.024
My little boy would...

14:18.057 --> 14:19.927
I can't lose this job.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.163
Ah
Then you best keep quiet.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.431
You're hurting me.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.698
Oh. Cry out. Call for help.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.268
I'm sure mistress
will believe

14:28.301 --> 14:29.769
your behavior
beyond reproach.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.203
Please

14:31.238 --> 14:33.340
Come, make a scene, huh?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.142
Shall I?

14:36.875 --> 14:38.845
No. No.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.213
No, no.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.485
We'll be as quiet as mice.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.892
No matter what.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.427
Sir...

14:54.461 --> 14:57.429
My son!

14:57.463 --> 15:00.432
Oh, he'll make
a fine dessert, huh?

15:00.466 --> 15:02.269
Oh...
(snarls)

15:06.773 --> 15:08.942
(gasping)

15:11.477 --> 15:12.644
(gasps)

15:25.993 --> 15:27.995
(owl hooting)

15:30.929 --> 15:32.932
Trouble sleeping?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.102
You're not here.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.171
I'm always here.

15:39.938 --> 15:41.908
Leave me alone.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.909
I can't.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.212
You won't let me.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.783
What do you want?

15:50.817 --> 15:52.152
I want to die in bed

15:52.184 --> 15:53.419
surrounded by fat
grandchildren,

15:53.452 --> 15:57.256
but guess that's off the
menu.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.490
I'm sorry.

15:58.524 --> 15:59.792
You're sorry?

15:59.826 --> 16:01.260
For me?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.529
Don't bother.
I'm dead.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.099
I'm over it.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.436
If you want to
feel
sorry for someone,

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
you should feel sorry
for yourself.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.639
Oh, but I guess you've
already got that covered.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.942
I am sorry...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.811
for what I've done.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.181
What else can I say to you?

16:24.683 --> 16:27.320
I don't want
to
make you feel bad.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.957
I just want to show you
who you are.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.027
GILES:
You had a dream
about Angel.

16:34.061 --> 16:35.894
I was in
Angel's dream.

16:35.927 --> 16:38.298
I'm not sure...
Giles, there was
stuff in this
dream

16:38.331 --> 16:40.200
that I couldn't possibly
know about.

16:40.232 --> 16:41.801
It was Angel's past.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.903
He was dreaming it,
and somehow I got sucked in.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.540
There's something wrong
with him.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.011
I know.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.215
I've seen him.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.850
He wanted to know
why he was back.

16:58.884 --> 17:01.254
Is there a way for us
to find that out?

17:03.123 --> 17:04.423
Uh... possibly.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.825
I've-I've been looking.

17:05.857 --> 17:08.493
Well, let me
look, too.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.097
I'm not seeing him anymore.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.165
I'm trying to put
all this behind me,

17:13.200 --> 17:15.166
and I'm not gonna be able to
as long as we're both

17:15.201 --> 17:17.703
doing guest spots
in each other's dreams.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.143
So we'll help
him?

17:24.477 --> 17:25.743
Yes.

17:27.146 --> 17:28.980
Where do we start?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.287
Look, I'm aware I haven't
been
the mostest best friend to
you

17:34.320 --> 17:35.954
when it comes to
the whole Angel thing,

17:35.988 --> 17:38.023
and, um... I don't know.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.393
Maybe I finally got
the Chanukah spirit.

17:40.426 --> 17:45.064
Well, we start,
unsurprisingly, with
research.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.936
Uh, Xander, um...
the Black Chronicles.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.271
And, uh, Buffy,

17:52.305 --> 17:53.940
the diary of
Lucious
Temple,

17:53.972 --> 17:56.476
an acolyte of Acathla,
an expert on demons.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.145
You can skip the passages
on his garden,

17:59.179 --> 18:01.913
unless you're keen on
growing heartier beets.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.151
Are you sure this is how

18:04.183 --> 18:05.785
you want to spend
your Christmas vacation?

18:05.817 --> 18:07.653
Yeah, this is actually
the most exciting thing

18:07.686 --> 18:09.087
I've got planned.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.557
Who else can claim that
pathetic a social life?

18:10.589 --> 18:12.991
Hey, guys.
What are we doing?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.096
*

18:28.641 --> 18:31.109
He's gonna come over
on Christmas Eve,

18:31.144 --> 18:33.680
'cause my parents
are out of town.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.182
We're gonna watch videos.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.416
That's good,
right?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.286
You guys are back.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.153
It's good.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.855
It's perfect,

18:42.888 --> 18:46.358
in an awkward,
uncomfortable sort of way.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.096
I just don't know how
to make Oz trust me.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.532
Xander has a piece of you

18:53.566 --> 18:55.501
that Oz just can't touch.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.104
I guess now it's just
about showing Oz

18:58.136 --> 19:01.307
that he comes first.

19:01.340 --> 19:03.075
I guess.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.412
Thanks.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.780
Hey, he likes beets.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.616
I read that one already.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.751
(sighs) We're not
getting any
closer.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.154
(gasping, shuddering)

19:16.189 --> 19:18.857
MAN:
The thing I
remember most

19:18.891 --> 19:21.661
was thinking how
artful it was.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.395
In the dark,

19:23.430 --> 19:27.334
they looked just like
they were sleeping.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.868
It wasn't until I bent down
and kissed them good night

19:29.902 --> 19:32.971
that I felt how...
cold they were.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.173
You grabbed me,
and I thought,

19:35.208 --> 19:38.176
who would go to so much trouble

19:38.211 --> 19:40.947
to arrange them like that?

19:42.582 --> 19:45.050
But you see,

19:45.084 --> 19:47.987
that's what makes you
different than other beasts.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.689
They kill to feed,

19:49.721 --> 19:53.226
but you took more kinds
of pleasure in it

19:53.259 --> 19:56.328
than any creature
that walks or crawls.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.029
Oh, God.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.398
Yeah, cry out.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.732
Oh...

20:00.767 --> 20:02.234
Make a scene.

20:02.269 --> 20:04.703
I was to be married that
week,

20:04.737 --> 20:06.172
but then,
as I recall,

20:06.204 --> 20:07.839
you knew that.

20:07.874 --> 20:08.740
That wasn't me.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.175
It wasn't you?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.411
A demon isn't a man.

20:11.443 --> 20:12.545
I was a man,
once.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.046
Oh, yes,

20:14.079 --> 20:16.015
and what a man you were.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.417
(singing, whooping, laughing)

20:21.253 --> 20:23.955
A drunken,
whoring layabout,

20:23.990 --> 20:27.259
and a terrible
disappointment
to your parents.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.461
I was young.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.730
I never had
a chance to...

20:31.763 --> 20:33.732
To die of
syphilis?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.734
You were a worthless being

20:35.768 --> 20:37.470
before you
were
ever a
monster.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.738
Just stop it!

20:38.770 --> 20:39.971
Stop.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.641
(sobbing)

20:41.673 --> 20:44.277
I don't want
to
hurt you, Angel,

20:44.310 --> 20:46.177
but you have
to understand.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.648
Cruelty's the only thing

20:49.682 --> 20:51.617
you ever had
a true talent for.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.951
That's not true.

20:52.984 --> 20:54.987
Shh. Rest.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.257
Rest.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.131
You mistake it
for a curse, Angel,

21:05.163 --> 21:06.965
but it's not.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.170
It's your destiny.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.208
I'll show you.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.144
I'll show you.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.652
*

21:55.748 --> 21:57.750
*

22:25.511 --> 22:27.513
*

22:55.741 --> 22:57.743
*

23:02.914 --> 23:04.584
(Buffy gasps)

23:07.385 --> 23:10.288
(gasping)

23:10.321 --> 23:11.758
You want her?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.025
No.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.961
Take her.

23:14.993 --> 23:17.529
Take what you want.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.531
Pour all that frustration

23:19.566 --> 23:20.932
and all that guilt into her,

23:20.967 --> 23:22.769
and you'll be free.

23:22.801 --> 23:24.069
No.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.776
You can't live for eternity
with all that pain.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.644
This is what you are.

23:31.678 --> 23:34.780
This is why
we brought you back.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.082
Take her.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.286
And then you'll be ready...

23:40.318 --> 23:42.253
to kill her.

23:51.463 --> 23:53.098
Here, Buffy.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.967
Take a
look.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.171
These letters contain references

23:59.204 --> 24:01.673
to an ancient
power
known as the
First.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.275
First what?

24:03.308 --> 24:05.111
Evil. Absolute evil,

24:05.144 --> 24:07.179
older than man, than demons.

24:07.212 --> 24:09.280
It could have had the
power
to bring Angel back.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.416
These guys...

24:11.450 --> 24:13.184
I-I saw them

24:13.219 --> 24:14.452
in my dream.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.288
I fell asleep up there.

24:16.321 --> 24:17.824
You had another dream?
With Angel?

24:19.224 --> 24:20.660
What happened?

24:22.193 --> 24:24.329
Oh, we don't need
to get sidetracked.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.865
Who are these guys?

24:25.897 --> 24:27.599
Um, they're known
as the, uh...

24:27.634 --> 24:30.670
as the
Bringers
or Harbingers.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.371
They're high priests
of the First.

24:32.403 --> 24:34.941
They, uh, they can conjure
spirit manifestations

24:34.973 --> 24:36.342
and set them on people--

24:36.375 --> 24:37.876
influence
them,
haunt
them.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.311
These are the guys working
the mojo on
Angel.

24:40.346 --> 24:41.780
XANDER
We gotta stop
them.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.183
Y-You can't fight
the First, Buffy.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.552
It's not a...
a physical being.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.520
Well, I-I can fight
these priest
guys.

24:48.555 --> 24:49.822
If we can find 'em.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.028
(music playing low)

24:57.063 --> 24:59.030
WILLY:
Hey.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.833
It's the
slayer.

25:00.866 --> 25:02.367
What brings the, uh,
slayer down here?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.037
(low growling)

25:05.070 --> 25:08.473
Hey, Willy, how you been?

25:08.507 --> 25:11.009
Keeping out of trouble,

25:11.042 --> 25:13.011
as God is my witness.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.314
So what can I do for you?

25:15.346 --> 25:16.715
Couple of drinks?

25:16.749 --> 25:20.352
Yeah. Let me get
a double shot of, um...

25:20.385 --> 25:22.020
of information, pal.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.823
BUFFY:
Three priests.
They
call themselves...

25:23.855 --> 25:25.057
XANDER:
The Bringers.

25:25.090 --> 25:27.259
Bringers, Harbingers.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.494
They have a "no eyes"
kind of look.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.863
Doesn't ring a
bell.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.732
How about I ring
that bell for you?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.334
Does the threatening
come now?

25:35.366 --> 25:36.868
Maybe you
shouldn't
help.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.871
They would've come
to town recently.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.740
They'd be holed up somewhere,

25:40.772 --> 25:42.709
summoning the spirit
of the First.

25:46.211 --> 25:49.381
Well, I heard a few things,

25:49.414 --> 25:51.049
you know, from the underground.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.919
The underground?
Yeah, you know.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.121
From things that live
under the ground.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.222
Apparently, there's been a
lot
of migration out of Sunnydale

25:57.256 --> 25:58.857
from the lower inhabitants.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.759
Something's scaring them off,

26:00.792 --> 26:02.628
and these are things
that are not easily scared.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.864
Could be your priest guys
are underground.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.231
Underground where?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.900
I do not know.

26:09.602 --> 26:10.803
Okay.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.070
Thanks.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.571
See you around.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.907
Hey. You did great,
by the way.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.943
I was very intimidated by
you.

26:17.977 --> 26:18.810
Really?

26:19.979 --> 26:22.147
Thanks.
Let's go.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.916
Hey, kid?

26:24.951 --> 26:26.919
Merry Christmas.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.430
Man, is it
hot.

26:38.463 --> 26:40.298
It was so nice
and cool in there.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.335
Yeah, a nice cool
waste of time.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.570
We know
underground.
That's a start.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.641
Sure, in a town
with 14 million
square miles of sewer.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.843
Plus a lot of natural
cave
formations

26:50.876 --> 26:52.478
and a gateway to hell.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.846
Yeah, this does
resemble square
one.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.949
I don't know what to do.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.151
I think right now
the best plan is

26:59.184 --> 27:01.788
to deck the halls
with boughs of holly.

27:01.820 --> 27:04.355
Look, we'll catch
the bad guys,

27:04.390 --> 27:06.525
sooner or later.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.999
(soft, romantic music
playing)

27:13.031 --> 27:14.299
Willow?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.502
I got videos.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.904
WILLOW:
Hi.

27:20.372 --> 27:24.242
Why don't you
come
s-sit down?

27:36.387 --> 27:38.758
* I've heard people say that
*

27:41.027 --> 27:45.832
* Too much of anything
is not good for you, baby *

27:45.865 --> 27:48.400
You ever have that dream
where you're in a play,

27:48.433 --> 27:49.868
and it's the middle of the play,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.636
and you really don't
know your lines,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.572
and you kind of
don't know the plot?

27:53.605 --> 27:56.174
Well, we're alone,

27:56.208 --> 27:58.911
and we're together.

27:58.944 --> 28:02.013
I just wanted it
to be special.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.516
Well, how special we talking?

28:04.549 --> 28:07.685
Well, you know, we're alone,

28:07.720 --> 28:12.490
and we're both mature
younger people,

28:12.523 --> 28:14.192
and-and so...

28:14.226 --> 28:15.426
* My darling

28:15.461 --> 28:16.694
...we could...

28:16.729 --> 28:19.164
I-I'm ready to...

28:19.198 --> 28:21.000
w-with you.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.234
We could do that thing.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.238
* I don't know why

28:26.271 --> 28:28.707
* I can't get enough
of your love, babe *

28:28.740 --> 28:29.942
Where are you going?

28:29.976 --> 28:31.210
No, I'm not going.

28:31.242 --> 28:33.345
Just a dramatic gesture.

28:33.378 --> 28:36.115
That's-that's
pretty
special.

28:38.116 --> 28:39.751
Oz, I...

28:39.786 --> 28:41.619
I want to be with you.

28:41.653 --> 28:42.922
First.

28:42.954 --> 28:45.290
I think we should
sit down again.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.126
* Oh, no, babe

28:48.160 --> 28:49.595
* Tell me

28:49.627 --> 28:50.896
Oz?

28:50.930 --> 28:52.730
* What am I gonna do?

28:52.765 --> 28:54.566
I-I'm ready.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.909
Okay. Well, don't take
this the wrong way...

29:04.242 --> 29:07.479
but... I'm not.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.082
Are you scared?

29:10.115 --> 29:12.084
'Cause I thought you had...
No, I...

29:12.117 --> 29:13.952
I have.

29:13.986 --> 29:16.122
But this is different.

29:16.154 --> 29:18.990
I mean, you look
great, you know.

29:19.025 --> 29:22.560
And-and you got the Barry
working for you,

29:22.594 --> 29:24.730
and-and it's
all...

29:24.762 --> 29:26.664
good.

29:26.698 --> 29:29.768
But when it happens...

29:31.537 --> 29:34.440
I want it to be because
we both need it to,

29:34.472 --> 29:37.143
for the same reason.

29:37.175 --> 29:40.746
You don't have
to prove anything to me.

29:40.778 --> 29:44.282
I just wanted you to know.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.817
I know.

29:45.852 --> 29:48.287
I get the message.

29:48.319 --> 29:51.123
* More than I can stand

29:51.156 --> 29:54.160
* Oh, well, babe
*

29:54.192 --> 29:56.327
* How can I explain...

29:56.362 --> 29:58.364
("Hark the Herald Angels
Sing"
playing quietly)

30:01.799 --> 30:03.869
There we
go.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.636
Nothing like
a roaring fire

30:05.671 --> 30:07.306
to keep away
the blistering heat.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.674
Oh, come on. It's lovely.

30:09.708 --> 30:13.011
Maybe I should turn
the air conditioning on.

30:16.682 --> 30:18.717
So, Angel's
on top again?

30:18.750 --> 30:19.986
What?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.819
Angel or star?

30:21.854 --> 30:25.723
Oh, uh... star.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.558
Star.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.028
(doorbell rings)

30:35.166 --> 30:37.836
Hey.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.172
Hi.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.808
Uh, looked like
that whole party thing

30:43.842 --> 30:45.944
was gonna be kind of a drag.

30:47.546 --> 30:51.017
I didn't really
have anything...

30:51.049 --> 30:52.851
you know.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.288
I'm glad you
came.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.358
Uh... here.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.428
Why don't you come in

31:02.461 --> 31:05.030
from the entire lack of cold?

31:05.064 --> 31:06.698
Mm.

31:06.731 --> 31:09.101
Uh, that one
is for your mom.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.536
They're pretty crappy.

31:10.568 --> 31:12.070
Faith, you made it.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.340
Oh, that is
so thoughtful.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.076
They're
crappy.

31:17.108 --> 31:18.210
BUFFY:
You know,

31:18.243 --> 31:19.444
I'm gonna go upstairs

31:19.478 --> 31:20.846
and get your gifts.
Excuse me.

31:20.878 --> 31:22.914
Uh, would you like some nog?

31:22.949 --> 31:24.549
Okay, Mom, don't touch
yours, though,

31:24.583 --> 31:26.785
'cause then you're gonna
know what it is.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.557
Angel.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.961
(exhales)

31:34.993 --> 31:36.929
Buffy.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.097
What is it?

31:39.131 --> 31:41.467
(clears throat)

31:41.500 --> 31:43.134
I gotta... I...

31:44.936 --> 31:47.306
Look, I, uh,
I had to see you, um...

31:50.308 --> 31:52.310
I don't know,
I...

31:53.644 --> 31:55.646
You shouldn't be...

31:55.681 --> 31:57.816
Just tell me what's going on.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.887
She wants you to touch her.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.156
What are you waiting for?

32:05.191 --> 32:07.625
You have to stay away from
me.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.894
BUFFY:
You came to see me

32:08.926 --> 32:11.430
to tell me that I can't see you?

32:14.799 --> 32:16.134
Angel, something

32:16.167 --> 32:19.505
is doing this to you.

32:20.838 --> 32:23.308
You just have to
control it, okay?

32:23.342 --> 32:25.176
I-I know that you're confused...

32:25.211 --> 32:27.645
I think you're the one
who's confused.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.414
I think you need to...

32:29.448 --> 32:32.784
She wants you to taste her.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.752
Think of the peace.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.988
You'll never have

32:36.021 --> 32:37.990
to see us again.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.290
Angel, how can I help you?

32:39.325 --> 32:40.625
Leave me alone!

32:43.328 --> 32:44.829
BUFFY:
 I just need you
 to stay with Mom

32:44.863 --> 32:46.097
in case he comes back.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.365
Yeah, I'll play watchdog.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.799
I don't really
get it,
though.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.135
I'll explain later.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.603
Everything. I promise.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.472
Watch your back.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.874
Giles, we have
to do something.

32:55.906 --> 32:57.143
Soon.
Now.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.876
I'm still not sure what.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.012
Find me these priest
guys.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.148
Find me something
I can pummel.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.150
Let's not lose our heads.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.251
Giles, he's slipping.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.990
I think we're losing him.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.625
Look...

33:14.660 --> 33:17.229
You realize, if he...

33:17.262 --> 33:19.298
truly becomes a danger,

33:19.330 --> 33:21.666
you may have
to kill him.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.902
Again.

33:24.935 --> 33:26.505
Can you do that?

33:28.207 --> 33:29.575
I can't do it.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.210
You have to do
it.

33:31.242 --> 33:33.744
What else are you good for?
Get away from me.

33:33.778 --> 33:37.583
Huh?
Couldn't you just...
feel her?

33:37.615 --> 33:40.586
Couldn't you
almost
smell her
skin?

33:42.288 --> 33:44.222
You never were
a fighter, Angel.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.523
Don't start trying
now.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.560
Sooner or later,
you will drink her.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.030
I'll never hurt her.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.500
You were born to hurt her.
Have you learned nothing?

33:55.534 --> 33:56.902
As long as
you are alive...

33:56.934 --> 33:59.137
Then I'll
die.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.008
You don't have the strength
to kill yourself.

34:03.040 --> 34:04.442
I don't need strength.

34:07.945 --> 34:10.315
I just need the sun to rise.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.088
You're not supposed to die.
This isn't the plan.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.896
But it'll do.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.539
"A child shall be born
of man and goat

34:34.572 --> 34:36.141
"and have two heads,

34:36.175 --> 34:39.143
and the first shall speak
only in riddles..."

34:39.177 --> 34:40.579
No wonder you like
this stuff.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.481
It's like reading the sun.

34:42.514 --> 34:43.949
Yes.
Ah.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.550
Priests?

34:45.583 --> 34:46.784
Um... yes, but,
uh,

34:46.818 --> 34:48.152
more
posturing,
I'm
afraid.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.322
Um..."For they are
the Harbingers of Death.

34:50.356 --> 34:53.425
"Nothing shall
grow
above or below them.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.460
No seed shall flower,
neither in man nor..."

34:55.494 --> 34:59.297
They're rebels and they'll
never, ever be any good.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.666
Nothing specific
about their
haunts.

35:00.699 --> 35:01.967
Let me see that.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.639
"The Harbingers of Death.

35:07.672 --> 35:11.108
Nothing shall grow
above or below."

35:13.010 --> 35:14.646
What?

35:16.215 --> 35:18.217
*

35:42.507 --> 35:44.510
(grunting)

35:59.358 --> 36:01.760
(indistinct chanting)

36:16.275 --> 36:17.809
All right,

36:17.842 --> 36:18.876
ten more minutes of chanting,

36:18.909 --> 36:20.211
and then you guys

36:20.246 --> 36:21.447
have to go to
bed.

36:27.184 --> 36:28.586
(grunting)

36:28.619 --> 36:32.291
Hmm. I'm impressed.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.161
You won't get Angel.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.998
Hmm, you think you can fight me?

36:40.030 --> 36:41.599
I'm not a demon,
little girl.

36:41.632 --> 36:45.304
I am something
that you can't even conceive.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.739
The first evil.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.907
Beyond sin,

36:49.940 --> 36:52.510
beyond death.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.514
I am the thing
that darkness fears.

36:56.547 --> 37:00.751
You'll never see me,
but I am everywhere.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.387
Every being,

37:02.420 --> 37:04.222
every thought,

37:04.255 --> 37:06.090
every drop of hate.

37:06.123 --> 37:07.759
All right, I get it.
You're evil.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.628
Do we have to
chat about it all day?

37:09.661 --> 37:13.097
Angel will be
dead
by sunrise.

37:13.130 --> 37:15.233
Your Christmas

37:15.266 --> 37:17.568
will be his wake.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.038
No.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.574
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.108
Let me guess.

37:24.141 --> 37:26.010
Is it... evil?

37:29.447 --> 37:31.916
Dead by sunrise!

37:31.949 --> 37:33.952
Angel!

37:52.170 --> 37:54.172
(grunts)

37:59.478 --> 38:02.280
Angel?

38:04.650 --> 38:08.119
I bet half the kids
down there are already awake.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.255
Lying in their beds.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.023
Sneaking downstairs.

38:13.057 --> 38:14.925
Waiting for day.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.126
Angel, please.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.597
I need you to get inside.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.798
There's only
a few minutes left.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.199
I know.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.302
I can smell the sunrise
long before it comes.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.204
I don't have time
to explain this.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.472
You just have to trust me.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.039
That thing
that was haunting you--

38:29.074 --> 38:31.476
It wasn't haunting me.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.378
It was showing me.

38:33.411 --> 38:34.679
Showing you?

38:34.713 --> 38:36.382
What I am.
Were.

38:36.414 --> 38:37.882
And ever shall
be.

38:37.916 --> 38:40.719
I wanted to know why I was back.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.487
Now I do.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.690
You don't know.

38:44.722 --> 38:46.992
Some great
evil
takes credit

38:47.025 --> 38:48.827
for bringing you back
and you buy it?

38:48.860 --> 38:50.228
You just give up?

38:50.260 --> 38:51.463
I can't do it again, Buffy.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.864
I can't become a killer.

38:52.898 --> 38:53.965
Then fight it.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.300
It's too hard.
Mm-mm.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.036
Angel, please, you have
to get inside.

38:58.068 --> 38:59.371
It told me to kill you.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.706
You were in the dream.
You know.

39:01.739 --> 39:04.175
It told me to lose my soul in
you and become a monster again.

39:04.208 --> 39:06.744
I know what it told you.
What does it matter?

39:06.777 --> 39:07.746
Because I wanted to!

39:07.778 --> 39:10.882
Because I want you so badly.

39:10.916 --> 39:12.884
I want to take comfort in you,

39:12.918 --> 39:14.885
and I know it'll
cost me my soul,

39:14.920 --> 39:17.355
and a part of me
doesn't care.

39:20.925 --> 39:22.527
Look, I'm weak.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.329
I've never been
anything else.

39:24.362 --> 39:28.199
It's not the demon in me
that needs killing, Buffy.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.068
It's the man.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.436
You're weak.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.371
Everybody is.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.005
Everybody fails.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.175
Maybe this evil
did bring you back,

39:37.208 --> 39:39.744
but if it did,
it's because it needs you.

39:39.777 --> 39:41.547
And that means
that you can hurt it.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.882
Angel,

39:43.914 --> 39:46.083
you have the
power
to do real good,

39:46.117 --> 39:47.686
to make amends.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.221
But if you die
now, then all

39:50.255 --> 39:52.990
that you ever
were
was a monster.

39:54.992 --> 39:58.063
Angel, please,
the sun is coming up.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.230
Just go.
I won't.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.465
Do you think this is simple?

40:00.498 --> 40:01.967
You think there's
an easy answer?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.735
You can never understand
what I've done.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.637
Now go.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.172
You are not staying here.
I won't let you!
I said leave!

40:10.240 --> 40:11.443
Oh, my god.

40:13.143 --> 40:15.146
No!
No!

40:15.179 --> 40:18.416
Am I a thing
worth saving, huh?

40:18.449 --> 40:20.485
Am I a righteous man?

40:20.518 --> 40:23.822
The world wants me gone.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.494
What about me?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.797
I love you so much.

40:34.431 --> 40:37.568
And I tried
to make you go away.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.771
I killed you

40:39.804 --> 40:42.139
and it didn't help.

40:42.172 --> 40:44.309
And I hate it!

40:45.443 --> 40:49.079
I hate that it's so hard.

40:49.114 --> 40:52.518
And that you can
hurt me so much.

40:55.686 --> 40:57.255
I know everything

40:57.288 --> 41:01.126
that you did,
because you did it to me.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.193
Oh, god.

41:03.228 --> 41:06.297
I wish that I wished you
dead.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.702
I don't.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.971
I can't.

41:20.045 --> 41:22.514
Buffy, please.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.653
Just this once.

41:28.686 --> 41:31.322
Let me be strong.

41:31.356 --> 41:33.559
Strong is fighting.

41:33.592 --> 41:36.494
It's hard and it's painful,

41:36.527 --> 41:38.128
and it's every day.

41:38.163 --> 41:40.498
It's what we have to do.

41:40.532 --> 41:43.001
And we can do it together.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.472
But if you're too much
of a coward for that,

41:47.505 --> 41:49.306
then burn.

41:49.340 --> 41:50.809
If I can't convince
you

41:50.842 --> 41:52.476
that you belong in this
world,

41:52.510 --> 41:55.512
then I don't know what can.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.684
But do not expect me to
watch.

41:58.717 --> 42:01.552
And don't expect me
to mourn for you, because--

42:43.393 --> 42:45.764
*

43:14.324 --> 43:16.695
*

43:38.684 --> 43:40.786
TV WEATHERMAN: And while most
of Southern California

43:40.818 --> 43:42.688
is enjoying a balmy
Christmas,

43:42.721 --> 43:45.791
an extreme cold front
has sprung up out of nowhere

43:45.824 --> 43:49.027
around Sunnydale, where they are
reporting heavy snowfall

43:49.059 --> 43:51.028
for the first
time
in, well, ever.

43:51.061 --> 43:52.597
Sunnydale residents
shouldn't expect

43:52.630 --> 43:54.132
to see the sun at all today.

43:54.164 --> 43:55.934
That cold front
isn't going anywhere.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.936
With temperatures
in the high 30s,

43:57.969 --> 44:01.106
means you better bundle up
if you're planning to go outside

44:01.139 --> 44:03.541
and enjoy the change
in the weather...

44:15.652 --> 44:18.056
*

45:17.481 --> 45:19.885
Grr. Argh.
