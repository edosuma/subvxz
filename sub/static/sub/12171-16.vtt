00:12.708 --> 00:14.042
[Voiceover]
Tonight, more surprises,

00:14.083 --> 00:15.703
than a secret wedding, as
the Shahs of Sunset reunite.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.333
Let the truth be spoken.

00:19.375 --> 00:20.542
- I listened to
- Justin Bieber's album

00:20.545 --> 00:22.021
And would cry like

00:22.022 --> 00:23.500
a little baby.

00:23.542 --> 00:25.042
- You know what it feels
- like to be

00:25.045 --> 00:26.333
Three fat people in a tent?

00:26.375 --> 00:27.708
- You guys aren't fat.
- Pleasantly plump.

00:27.711 --> 00:28.958
Vida, are you excited

00:28.959 --> 00:30.207
to be a grandma?

00:30.208 --> 00:31.542
- No.
- Yes.

00:31.545 --> 00:34.625
Andy, don't encourage them.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.771
I'm not a player,

00:35.772 --> 00:36.874
I just crush a lot.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.625
How can one human consume

00:38.626 --> 00:40.374
that much ceviche?

00:40.375 --> 00:41.542
You guys like to go through

00:41.543 --> 00:42.707
the buffet line faster.

00:42.708 --> 00:43.708
They eat too fast

00:43.709 --> 00:44.708
in the buffet?

00:44.709 --> 00:46.541
( laughing )

00:46.542 --> 00:47.771
F... this, let's get

00:47.772 --> 00:49.000
to sex already.

00:49.042 --> 00:51.125
I wanna cry for you, because

00:51.126 --> 00:53.208
no one can walk in your shoes.

00:53.250 --> 00:55.229
Her mom knew I was gay

00:55.230 --> 00:57.208
before my mom and dad knew.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.917
- You're on the right path,
- so I commend you for that.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.167
I appreciate that.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.458
Use your own big,

01:01.459 --> 01:02.708
hanging ass.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.208
- Did something happen
- to Golnesa

01:04.250 --> 01:05.875
That was never addressed?

01:05.876 --> 01:07.500
Did somebody hurt you?

01:07.542 --> 01:08.646
I want to fix what

01:08.647 --> 01:09.749
the f... was going on.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.167
Why? Because I was trying

01:11.168 --> 01:12.582
to protect Jessica.

01:12.583 --> 01:13.875
It's really sad.

01:13.876 --> 01:15.167
I f... ed up.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.875
Shame on you.

01:17.876 --> 01:19.000
MJ's not a loyal friend.

01:19.042 --> 01:20.375
You are being a

01:20.376 --> 01:21.708
low-down person.

01:21.750 --> 01:22.959
You're a jealous,

01:22.960 --> 01:24.167
bitter girl.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.583
- Okay, I wanna,
- I wanna get in here.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.268
- You think I'm gonna tolerate
- that type of criticism

01:27.292 --> 01:28.605
That she gives to this

01:28.606 --> 01:29.917
beautiful angel?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.542
The whole time he was

01:31.543 --> 01:33.083
trying to get his wife back,

01:33.125 --> 01:34.792
- there was another guy
- in the picture.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.083
Wow.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.083
- One thing I will
- not stand for

01:37.125 --> 01:38.292
- Is sh... talking
- about my wife.

01:38.295 --> 01:39.750
I made a f... ing mistake.

01:39.792 --> 01:41.417
- I said Golnesa,
- do you have a tape?

01:41.458 --> 01:43.708
I wanted you to say no.

01:43.750 --> 01:44.938
Do you know what it does

01:44.939 --> 01:46.124
to my credibility

01:46.125 --> 01:47.457
when one of my friends...

01:47.458 --> 01:49.957
What about my credibility?

01:49.958 --> 01:51.458
- What the f...?
- Wait, please.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.125
- I wanna walk away.
- Have a conscience.

01:53.128 --> 01:55.208
The most humiliating...

02:19.167 --> 02:21.292
( growls )

02:37.958 --> 02:39.167
What do you mean?

02:43.208 --> 02:44.917
It's gonna be

02:44.918 --> 02:46.625
a rough day.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.292
Put it on silent for this.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.083
It's on silent.

02:50.125 --> 02:51.271
Hi, Asa Joon.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.417
Hi, Andy Joon.

02:52.458 --> 02:53.833
Hi.

02:53.834 --> 02:55.207
Hi.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.708
Can we get more champagne?

02:56.750 --> 02:57.875
Uh, yeah.

02:57.876 --> 02:59.000
All right, here we go.

02:59.042 --> 03:00.374
We're rolling.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.709
And five, four,

03:02.710 --> 03:05.042
three, two...

03:05.083 --> 03:06.874
Salaam, Shahs of Sunset.

03:06.875 --> 03:07.875
- Hey, Andy.
- Salaam.

03:07.917 --> 03:09.018
- Salaam, Andy Joon.
- And...

03:09.042 --> 03:12.041
( Speaking foreign language ).

03:12.042 --> 03:14.042
- How are you?
- Good. Did I get that right?

03:14.083 --> 03:15.292
Yes.

03:15.293 --> 03:16.500
[Reza] Perfecto.

03:16.542 --> 03:18.292
Welcome to this deliciously

03:18.293 --> 03:20.041
extravagant Persian palace

03:20.042 --> 03:21.209
at the very top

03:21.210 --> 03:22.374
of Beverly Hills.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.542
We are high above

03:23.543 --> 03:24.707
last year's chaos,

03:24.708 --> 03:25.792
and surrounded

03:25.793 --> 03:26.874
by evil eyes.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.292
These iconic symbols

03:28.293 --> 03:29.708
are supposed to protect you

03:29.750 --> 03:31.500
from "chesh",

03:31.542 --> 03:32.875
or at least from Reza's

03:32.876 --> 03:34.207
liquid ass spray.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.250
- Oh, God.
- Right?

03:35.253 --> 03:36.559
- There's no protecting
- from that.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.917
So what is chesh?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.249
[Reza] Chesh is evil eye.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.813
The evil eye, when you

03:40.814 --> 03:42.375
say "chesh," is jinx.

03:42.417 --> 03:43.667
Like, "don't chesh me."

03:43.708 --> 03:44.934
- It's a protective
- eye, basically.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.604
Reza, anyone here that

03:46.605 --> 03:48.249
you want protection from?

03:48.250 --> 03:50.833
I mean, hello.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.771
The one that

03:52.772 --> 03:54.667
jumped me, yeah.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.375
- GG, how nervous
- should he be?

03:56.417 --> 03:58.042
- Not too nervous.
- No?

03:58.083 --> 03:59.208
- No.
- You look great.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.583
- Thank you.
- How's the RA?

04:00.586 --> 04:02.125
A lot better, yeah.

04:02.126 --> 04:03.667
Well, very good.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.500
- Shervin, welcome
- to your first reunion.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.500
- Thank you. I'm excited.
- You nervous?

04:07.542 --> 04:09.250
- Um, nervous,
- excited, anxious.

04:09.253 --> 04:10.334
Okay, we have an

04:10.335 --> 04:11.417
abundance of questions.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.750
- What about me?
- Oh, hey, Mike.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.082
Yeah, remember me?

04:14.083 --> 04:15.750
- The season was pretty
- much about me.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.375
Uh, let's not forget, uh...

04:17.417 --> 04:18.938
A very handsome face,

04:18.939 --> 04:20.457
how can you forget it?

04:20.458 --> 04:21.583
The man of the season.

04:21.625 --> 04:22.625
- Was the season
- pretty much about you?

04:22.628 --> 04:23.792
Is that what - you just said?

04:23.793 --> 04:24.934
- It was pretty much about me.
- Oh, okay.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.292
- They, they pried into
- my life this season.

04:26.295 --> 04:27.958
- We're gonna pry some more
- into your life today.

04:27.961 --> 04:29.083
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.083
- That's fine.
- Okay. You doing well?

04:30.125 --> 04:31.125
Yeah, thank God.

04:31.126 --> 04:33.042
- The beard is kind
- of a new look.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.268
- You know, I had
- to change it up.

04:34.292 --> 04:35.583
Yeah.

04:35.625 --> 04:36.959
Look at these, uh, delicacies

04:36.960 --> 04:38.291
we have here today.

04:38.292 --> 04:39.667
Why is there a big spread

04:39.668 --> 04:41.042
at Persian events?

04:41.083 --> 04:42.271
Every household you walk

04:42.272 --> 04:43.457
into even if

04:43.458 --> 04:46.292
there is no-one expected...

04:46.333 --> 04:48.083
Hosting is a big...

04:48.125 --> 04:49.209
Culture times food

04:49.210 --> 04:50.291
represented wealth.

04:50.292 --> 04:51.875
So your carpet, Persian rugs,

04:51.876 --> 04:53.457
which we are known for

04:53.458 --> 04:54.583
and your food,

04:54.625 --> 04:56.417
- it represents your wealth
- and your class.

04:56.458 --> 04:57.646
[Asa] And guests are like,

04:57.647 --> 04:58.832
very, it's a blessing.

04:58.833 --> 04:59.934
- You can be welcoming
- and you have to feed them,

04:59.958 --> 05:01.167
And they have to leave stuff.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.667
- You can't offer
- them just one type of food,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.083
There has to be multiple...

05:04.125 --> 05:05.167
- A variety for
- anything you want.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.476
- It's almost a
- disrespectful thing,

05:06.500 --> 05:08.309
- To only give them, like,
- dinnertime, one main entrÃ©e.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.583
The sweeter, the richer,

05:09.584 --> 05:10.833
the better.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.063
Asa, you compared your

05:12.064 --> 05:13.250
crew to a bunch of fat kids,

05:13.292 --> 05:14.625
uh, who love to eat.

05:14.667 --> 05:15.625
- Well, including
- myself, obviously.

05:15.667 --> 05:16.832
Right.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.000
- Can we get some chicken
- and lettuce wraps?

05:18.003 --> 05:19.292
- Let me do a
- butter croissant.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.417
Hamburgers, hamburgers.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.292
You guys, it's ceviche.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.292
( Chomps )

05:24.333 --> 05:25.499
I need some food.

05:25.500 --> 05:26.976
- Do you wanna do tenders
- and a burger?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.229
Let's do nachos and tenders,

05:28.230 --> 05:29.458
because we can pick at it.

05:29.500 --> 05:30.979
I'm gonna hang up now,

05:30.980 --> 05:32.458
because I wanna eat more salami.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.625
I want a number one.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.458
- Can I get a number
- two, protein style?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.750
Number two,

05:36.751 --> 05:37.999
protein style, Coke Zero.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.018
- But not pickles,
- not pickles.

05:39.042 --> 05:40.500
And a strawberry shake.

05:40.542 --> 05:42.105
And chilis, and a

05:42.106 --> 05:43.667
protein-style double-double.

05:45.167 --> 05:46.417
You and Reza going through

05:46.418 --> 05:47.667
the drive-throughs,

05:47.708 --> 05:48.875
that was funny.

05:48.917 --> 05:50.309
- People liked how
- I eat the fries.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.875
- I don't know who eats
- fries one by one.

05:51.878 --> 05:53.542
I eat them by the handful.

05:53.583 --> 05:54.976
- You were going to town
- at the, uh,

05:55.000 --> 05:56.146
The bar of the comedy club

05:56.147 --> 05:57.292
with those chicken fingers.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.042
- I was so nervous.
- Right.

05:59.083 --> 06:00.979
So yeah, when I get, like,

06:00.980 --> 06:02.874
really nervous, I eat.

06:02.875 --> 06:03.938
Shervin, last year you

06:03.939 --> 06:05.000
got famous

06:05.042 --> 06:06.334
for shedding your shirt

06:06.335 --> 06:07.625
and taking a Cheetos bath.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.521
But this year, it was all

06:09.522 --> 06:11.374
about that date gone bad.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.167
- Do you like Mexican food?
- No.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.208
Noy?

06:14.209 --> 06:15.209
No.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.167
- Noy.
- I say "no," not "noy."

06:17.208 --> 06:18.476
- You like to play
- me up, don't you?

06:18.500 --> 06:19.851
- When you wake up in
- the morning

06:19.875 --> 06:21.063
And you see somebody, do you

06:21.064 --> 06:22.250
go, like, "Cheerio, guvna?"

06:22.292 --> 06:23.601
- That's a different country.
- It is?

06:23.625 --> 06:24.750
You do realize, yeah.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.375
- You barely drink,
- doesn't cost much,

06:26.417 --> 06:28.083
- You definitely don't eat,
- doesn't cost much.

06:28.086 --> 06:29.583
- This is awesome.
- Perfect girl?

06:29.625 --> 06:30.833
Until you talked.

06:32.917 --> 06:34.250
So, Annalise, still

06:34.251 --> 06:35.583
in the picture, or no?

06:35.625 --> 06:36.917
- Yes.
- Yes?

06:36.920 --> 06:38.083
- You said on "Watch
- What Happens Live"

06:38.086 --> 06:39.434
- That you weren't
- in a relationship.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.393
- You know, we're kind of
- farther away from each other.

06:41.417 --> 06:42.582
It's developing.

06:42.583 --> 06:43.893
- She lives on
- another continent.

06:43.917 --> 06:44.917
- There's not a whole
- lot of...

06:44.920 --> 06:46.250
- Oh, so she
- lives in Australia.

06:46.292 --> 06:47.393
- She lives in
- Australia, yeah.

06:47.417 --> 06:48.601
- So when she comes here,
- you hang out.

06:48.625 --> 06:49.583
- That's his girlfriend
- when she's here.

06:49.586 --> 06:51.542
Oh, okay, fine.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.667
Is he a player?

06:53.708 --> 06:55.667
- I... I'm not a player,
- I just crush a lot.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.583
- Oh, hel... No, you did not
- just do that.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.584
I like that.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.333
- Ainsley from
- West Virginia said,

07:00.375 --> 07:02.175
- "It was so fun seeing
- Shervin freaking out

07:02.208 --> 07:04.042
"About the bats in Belize."

07:04.083 --> 07:05.124
That was funny.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.458
- Shervin, what else
- are you afraid of?

07:06.461 --> 07:07.958
- I'm... I'm not a fan of bats.
- Yeah, scared...

07:07.961 --> 07:09.434
- Sherv, you're such a wuss.
- Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.

07:09.458 --> 07:10.708
- Where's the bats?
- Bats?

07:10.750 --> 07:11.792
Yeah.

07:11.833 --> 07:12.792
- Turn the light,
- get it away from that!

07:12.833 --> 07:14.124
Oh, sh...

07:14.125 --> 07:15.375
I... I don't like bats, bro.

07:15.376 --> 07:16.624
Oh, my God.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.958
- Oh!
- That's huge.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.768
- Okay, let's go out, guys.
- You were screaming.

07:19.792 --> 07:20.957
Yeah, he screamed.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.718
- I'm just not a... I'm not
- a fan of things

07:22.750 --> 07:24.458
- With fangs flying
- towards my face.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.750
It was cute.

07:26.792 --> 07:27.917
Daisy from Chicago said,

07:27.958 --> 07:29.292
- "Shervin, were you
- born in Iran?"

07:29.295 --> 07:30.583
I was.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.458
- How many of you
- were born in Iran?

07:32.461 --> 07:33.792
- Everybody except me
- and Golnesa.

07:33.795 --> 07:35.458
- Everybody except
- you and Golnesa.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.292
- Did you live in Alabama?
- Yes.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.292
- Yeah. I grew up in
- Huntsville, Alabama.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.125
- When we first came
- to the States we were

07:41.128 --> 07:42.209
Three families living in

07:42.210 --> 07:43.292
a one-bedroom apartment.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.708
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.042
It was an interesting place

07:46.043 --> 07:47.332
to be in the early '80s.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.417
How does a kid from...

07:48.418 --> 07:49.499
As a brown kid.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.125
Alabama via Iran become

07:52.126 --> 07:54.750
a Silicon Valley mogul?

07:54.792 --> 07:57.063
We had family in, um, in

07:57.064 --> 07:59.332
San Jose, and so after a while

07:59.333 --> 08:01.333
- I guess they quickly
- figured out that Huntsville,

08:01.336 --> 08:02.979
As great a town as it is, and

08:02.980 --> 08:04.625
as many cool people we met,

08:04.667 --> 08:06.417
not necessarily the best

08:06.418 --> 08:08.167
place for some brown kids.

08:08.208 --> 08:10.750
So off to Cali we went.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.230
People with white

08:12.231 --> 08:13.666
sheets kept knocking.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.834
Shervin, MJ originally

08:14.835 --> 08:15.999
introduced you to the group,

08:16.000 --> 08:17.625
but it seems like you got

08:17.626 --> 08:19.250
closer to Golnesa.

08:19.292 --> 08:20.313
Well... well you know,

08:20.314 --> 08:21.333
over the past year

08:21.375 --> 08:22.333
- it's like MJ's now
- in a relationship.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.684
- She used to hang
- out more often.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.351
- And I started dating his
- friends, so it was like...

08:25.375 --> 08:27.125
- So who are you
- closer to now?

08:27.167 --> 08:28.667
I'm really close with MJ,

08:28.708 --> 08:29.851
- I'm also really
- close with Golnesa.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.167
I end up spending

08:31.168 --> 08:32.458
more time with Golnesa,

08:32.500 --> 08:34.167
but I talk to MJ more often.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.875
Shervin's been really ride

08:35.876 --> 08:37.542
or die supportive of me,

08:37.583 --> 08:39.563
more than people

08:39.564 --> 08:41.542
I've known for years.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.813
And for me, loyalty

08:42.814 --> 08:44.042
is everything in life,

08:44.083 --> 08:45.396
completely, and...

08:45.397 --> 08:46.708
I have to interject.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.667
- Okay.
- Loyalty is everything?

08:48.708 --> 08:49.958
You have an issue with her.

08:49.959 --> 08:51.208
I do have an issue with her.

08:51.250 --> 08:54.188
GG is such a bad person that

08:54.189 --> 08:57.125
she needs mental assistance.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.708
How... why is she a bad person?

08:58.750 --> 09:00.458
She makes up stories.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.646
She literally has nothing

09:01.647 --> 09:02.792
going on in her life,

09:02.833 --> 09:03.938
and she tries to

09:03.939 --> 09:05.042
come up with bullsh...

09:05.083 --> 09:06.542
- To hurt people
- and get drama.

09:06.583 --> 09:07.604
You're still angry

09:07.605 --> 09:08.625
at, at her...

09:08.667 --> 09:10.375
I mean, Andy, come on.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.000
Girl, you said that you,

09:12.001 --> 09:13.582
you had a sex tape about me.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.250
- I never said
- I had the sex tape.

09:15.253 --> 09:16.416
Yes, you did.

09:16.417 --> 09:17.917
- And we saw my words,
- the caption said,

09:17.920 --> 09:19.583
- "Some guy said he
- has the sex tape."

09:19.625 --> 09:21.250
- No, no, no, no, that
- was you in the interview.

09:21.253 --> 09:22.459
That was my words.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.667
No, it wasn't my interview.

09:23.708 --> 09:24.917
- That was in the car,
- and I never told them...

09:24.920 --> 09:26.583
( Overlapping dialogue )

09:26.625 --> 09:28.184
- In my interviews they asked
- me, "Do you have a sex tape?"

09:28.208 --> 09:29.375
I said, "No."

09:29.417 --> 09:31.083
- I said, "Do you have"
- a sex tape about me?

09:31.086 --> 09:32.333
You said, "100 percent."

09:32.375 --> 09:34.208
- No, I don't have it.
- I never said that.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.750
- Do you have a video
- of me blowing somebody?

09:35.753 --> 09:37.208
- 100 percent.
- You do?

09:37.250 --> 09:38.479
100 percent? Okay.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.708
You said it.

09:39.750 --> 09:43.375
Shut the f... up, dumb-ass.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.584
[Voiceover] Coming up...

09:44.585 --> 09:45.749
MJ's not a loyal friend.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.582
You're thin-skinned.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.917
- Last word, you want your
- friends to treat you like this?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.958
- Come up with another word,
- other than "jealous."

09:51.961 --> 09:55.354
Okay, shh, you're giving

09:55.355 --> 09:58.750
me a headache.

09:58.833 --> 10:00.875
I never said
I had the sex tape.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.292
Yes, you did.
No, I said...

10:02.833 --> 10:04.226
- I said, "Do you have
- a sex tape about me,"

10:04.250 --> 10:05.457
And you said, "100 percent."

10:05.458 --> 10:06.792
- No, I don't have it,
- I never said that.

10:06.795 --> 10:08.958
- You said it.
- Shut the f... up, dumb-ass.

10:08.961 --> 10:10.875
You're a mentally ill woman.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.667
All right, let's put a

10:12.668 --> 10:14.417
pin in it, let's move on.

10:14.458 --> 10:16.125
- Reza, mazel tov
- to you and Adam.

10:16.167 --> 10:17.708
Thank you.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.125
- He finally made an
- honest man out of you.

10:19.128 --> 10:21.292
- Yes.
- The wedding was beautiful.

10:21.295 --> 10:22.624
Thank you.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.854
I now pronounce

10:23.855 --> 10:25.083
you partners in life.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.750
You may kiss the groom.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.375
( Applause, cheering )

10:31.833 --> 10:33.083
You know, with those

10:33.084 --> 10:34.332
simple words, "I do,"

10:34.333 --> 10:35.917
you go from being,

10:35.918 --> 10:37.500
you know, a separate entity

10:37.542 --> 10:39.499
to being a unity.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.083
Like we're one thing now.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.271
It's me and him

10:42.272 --> 10:43.417
against the world,

10:43.458 --> 10:45.271
and I'm ready for whatever

10:45.272 --> 10:47.083
life has in store for us.

10:49.667 --> 10:50.917
You know, Reza,

10:50.918 --> 10:52.166
you're Persian, you're gay,

10:52.167 --> 10:53.833
you're getting married on TV.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.604
Did you ever think that

10:55.605 --> 10:57.333
that confluence of events

10:57.375 --> 10:59.101
- would happen, I mean, that
- that would be possible?

10:59.125 --> 11:00.625
Never.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.084
I mean, hello... we're

11:02.085 --> 11:03.500
so lucky we had

11:03.542 --> 11:05.333
an African-American president,

11:05.375 --> 11:07.095
- we're about to have a
- woman president...

11:07.125 --> 11:08.292
- Woo!
- Hell, yes.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.583
You know, I'm gay,

11:09.584 --> 11:10.832
we can get married now.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.083
Like, sh...'s changing

11:12.084 --> 11:13.332
around these parts.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.479
You have to be the most famous

11:15.480 --> 11:17.625
Persian gay man out there.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.167
Do you hear from other

11:19.168 --> 11:20.667
Persian gay guys...

11:20.708 --> 11:22.542
- I do.
- Who look up to you?

11:22.545 --> 11:23.893
- Someone left a note
- on my windshield,

11:23.917 --> 11:26.146
And he was coming out to his

11:26.147 --> 11:28.374
family because of the show.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.417
And he left

11:29.418 --> 11:30.458
this really long,

11:30.500 --> 11:31.771
beautiful note on my car,

11:31.772 --> 11:33.042
which was...

11:33.083 --> 11:34.688
That's awesome.

11:34.689 --> 11:36.292
Made my life.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.393
- Ross from New York said,
- "Reza, how did you come up

11:38.417 --> 11:39.480
With your brilliant idea

11:39.481 --> 11:40.542
"for a surprise wedding?"

11:40.583 --> 11:42.292
Um, you know, when

11:42.293 --> 11:44.000
you make a huge mistake

11:44.042 --> 11:46.271
and you basically leave the man

11:46.272 --> 11:48.500
of your dreams at the altar,

11:48.542 --> 11:49.542
you need to come up

11:49.543 --> 11:50.543
with something

11:50.583 --> 11:51.771
to make up for

11:51.772 --> 11:52.958
the hurt and pain.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.459
How worried were you

11:55.460 --> 11:57.916
that he was going to say,

11:57.917 --> 11:59.416
"I'm not into this?"

11:59.417 --> 12:00.730
If he says "no,"

12:00.731 --> 12:02.042
it's okay,

12:02.083 --> 12:03.583
because he doesn't want it

12:03.584 --> 12:05.083
to go down like this,

12:05.125 --> 12:06.750
the same way I didn't want

12:06.751 --> 12:08.375
it to go down in Thailand.

12:08.417 --> 12:10.500
I have to just eat a dick

12:10.501 --> 12:12.582
and deal with it.

12:12.583 --> 12:13.750
Mm.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.105
Is your mom pressuring you

12:15.106 --> 12:16.416
to have kids right away?

12:16.417 --> 12:17.480
Oh, my mom is

12:17.481 --> 12:18.542
like can you just

12:18.583 --> 12:19.813
buy some kids

12:19.814 --> 12:21.042
on the Internet?

12:21.083 --> 12:22.417
And I'll take care

12:22.418 --> 12:23.749
of them for you.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.834
Reza, um, Sereta from

12:24.835 --> 12:25.917
West Palm Beach,

12:25.958 --> 12:27.667
- Florida, said,
- "Would you consider

12:27.708 --> 12:28.771
Having Asa or MJ

12:28.772 --> 12:29.833
"carry your child?"

12:29.875 --> 12:31.625
Adam has this whole plan,

12:31.626 --> 12:33.375
two eggs from the same woman.

12:33.417 --> 12:34.667
I inseminate one,

12:34.668 --> 12:35.917
he inseminates the other,

12:35.958 --> 12:37.792
- and they go inside
- of a surrogate,

12:37.795 --> 12:39.625
And we end up with twins

12:39.626 --> 12:41.457
that are half siblings.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.309
- [MJ] Reza and half Adam, and
- that's also my plan for them.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.291
Oh, okay.

12:45.292 --> 12:46.959
Uh, so one egg will be Asa,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.625
and an egg will be MJ.

12:48.667 --> 12:49.708
No, no, no, no.

12:49.750 --> 12:50.771
He just put

12:50.772 --> 12:51.792
the kibosh on that.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.457
Joan from New Mexico said,

12:53.458 --> 12:54.458
- "Mike, what was going
- through your mind

12:54.461 --> 12:56.292
- Watching your
- best friend get married

12:56.295 --> 12:57.958
- While your own marriage
- "was falling apart?"

12:57.961 --> 12:59.792
It was... it was hard.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.208
As excited as I was for

13:01.209 --> 13:02.583
Reza to get married,

13:02.625 --> 13:04.292
- I couldn't help
- but reflect on the day

13:04.295 --> 13:05.792
- I was walking
- down the aisle.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.146
MJ, Ellen from Chicago wants

13:07.147 --> 13:08.458
to know why you were going

13:08.500 --> 13:09.646
behind Reza's back

13:09.647 --> 13:10.792
to tell Adam to stand up

13:10.833 --> 13:12.291
for himself with Reza.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.768
- Weren't you worried
- that your talk

13:13.792 --> 13:15.101
- Could have sabotaged
- the wedding?

13:15.125 --> 13:16.354
I will take the risk

13:16.355 --> 13:17.583
to make sure that

13:17.625 --> 13:18.646
I have an authentic

13:18.647 --> 13:19.666
relationship with Reza,

13:19.667 --> 13:21.334
where he can say what he wants

13:21.335 --> 13:22.999
to say to me, and vice-versa.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.667
- MJ means well,
- but you get involved

13:24.670 --> 13:26.333
- In people's businesses
- that you shouldn't.

13:26.336 --> 13:27.976
- No problem, Mike,
- I'll let you tell me

13:28.000 --> 13:29.667
- What you're thinking,
- but if you're...

13:29.708 --> 13:30.667
- Yeah, I think
- what everyone else thinks,

13:30.708 --> 13:31.958
But they won't say it.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.167
Mike, MJ told you,

13:33.168 --> 13:34.332
Jessica, and Shervin about

13:34.333 --> 13:35.917
Reza's secret wedding plans

13:35.918 --> 13:37.499
at your Shabbat dinner.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.667
You guys, come hither

13:38.668 --> 13:39.832
please, por favor.

13:39.833 --> 13:41.167
Reza wants to surprise

13:41.168 --> 13:42.499
Adam with a wedding.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.334
Really?

13:44.335 --> 13:46.167
Mm, understate your response,

13:46.208 --> 13:47.667
- because I don't want
- him to know.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.625
- Well, I...
- It's gonna be a surprise.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.143
- You were upset that you
- were not gonna officiate

13:51.167 --> 13:53.184
- The wedding because you feel
- like you're very close to Reza.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.417
I am never gonna be

13:54.418 --> 13:55.625
an officiator of a wedding.

13:55.667 --> 13:57.500
- You think it was about
- her being jealous of Asa?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.625
Yes.

13:58.667 --> 13:59.625
- Did I ever call my self
- a priestess?

13:59.667 --> 14:00.851
- MJ made it about
- her, basically.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.208
- Let him talk.
- You made it about you, babe.

14:02.211 --> 14:03.333
I understand that you were

14:03.334 --> 14:04.458
upset and I felt your pain,

14:04.500 --> 14:06.542
- and then you came over and
- I think there was a... there was

14:06.545 --> 14:07.875
- A sense of wanting
- to sabotage

14:07.878 --> 14:09.184
- What he was trying to do
- because you didn't like the way

14:09.208 --> 14:10.374
He was going about it.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.375
- I didn't think
- the surprise was

14:11.378 --> 14:12.792
From anybody other than Adam.

14:12.833 --> 14:14.104
But he told you not

14:14.105 --> 14:15.375
to tell anyone.

14:15.417 --> 14:16.646
Reza, what did you think

14:16.647 --> 14:17.874
when you saw MJ

14:17.875 --> 14:19.000
going in Adam's ear

14:19.001 --> 14:20.125
behind your back?

14:20.167 --> 14:22.333
- My thing, from what I see,
- is that you want

14:22.375 --> 14:23.438
Equality within this

14:23.439 --> 14:24.500
relationship.

14:24.542 --> 14:25.855
You're with a very

14:25.856 --> 14:27.167
dominating alpha male.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.208
I want your voice

14:28.209 --> 14:29.208
to be strong,

14:29.209 --> 14:30.875
- I don't want you
- to be dominated.

14:30.878 --> 14:31.938
Ultimately, I

14:31.939 --> 14:33.000
know MJ loves me.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.917
One thing I know about

14:34.918 --> 14:36.792
MJ is her mind works

14:36.833 --> 14:38.271
in a certain way, and

14:38.272 --> 14:39.707
if something is not in line

14:39.708 --> 14:42.042
with what she thinks, she

14:42.043 --> 14:44.375
can't wrap her head around it.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.646
Do you think any of this

14:46.647 --> 14:48.875
was rooted in her jealousy

14:48.917 --> 14:50.646
of your relationship with

14:50.647 --> 14:52.375
the Persian pop priestess?

14:52.417 --> 14:53.834
Only in the regards

14:53.835 --> 14:55.250
that there is,

14:55.292 --> 14:57.500
there's a pecking order,

14:57.501 --> 14:59.708
and she wants to be told...

14:59.750 --> 15:01.292
Do you wanna laugh louder?

15:01.293 --> 15:02.833
At the same time.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.313
It's because I want

15:04.314 --> 15:05.749
to be included,

15:05.750 --> 15:06.875
and when I feel excluded,

15:06.876 --> 15:08.000
I get hurt.

15:08.042 --> 15:09.688
So do you not, after all

15:09.689 --> 15:11.333
these years, recognize that?

15:11.375 --> 15:12.916
No, they don't.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.250
They like to go... like when...

15:14.292 --> 15:15.559
- You like to make everything
- about yourself.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.082
Okay, you know what...

15:17.083 --> 15:18.518
- Your best friend's getting
- married, it's not about you.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.601
- I'm gonna give you an example.
- Perfect.

15:19.625 --> 15:20.917
- It has nothing
- to do with that.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.875
You guys like to eat faster,

15:22.917 --> 15:24.521
and you like to go through

15:24.522 --> 15:26.125
the buffet line faster.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.230
You like to spend

15:27.231 --> 15:28.291
more time at the buffet?

15:28.292 --> 15:29.771
We got in a car to go

15:29.772 --> 15:31.250
to your favorite buffet.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.792
We were in traffic, we got in

15:32.793 --> 15:34.292
the car a little bit later.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.583
You guys didn't wait.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.021
By the time you guys

15:37.022 --> 15:38.417
went through, your napkins were

15:38.458 --> 15:40.208
piled on top of your plates,

15:40.209 --> 15:41.957
and we were just coming in.

15:41.958 --> 15:43.688
And you said to me,

15:43.689 --> 15:45.417
Merce, you eat so slowly.

15:45.458 --> 15:46.604
And you also confessed

15:46.605 --> 15:47.750
that you think

15:47.792 --> 15:49.809
- that I eat slowly, and
- you're fast and you're fast.

15:49.833 --> 15:50.957
They leave you...

15:50.958 --> 15:52.354
How many times did

15:52.355 --> 15:53.750
we go for ice cream,

15:53.792 --> 15:55.143
- and you guys started
- eating first?

15:55.167 --> 15:56.958
- This is, like, so petty
- and ridiculous.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.271
You have no respect

15:58.272 --> 15:59.542
for anyone's time.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.375
- She's on, like,
- double Persian time.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.855
You're being...

16:02.856 --> 16:04.291
You're being disrespectful.

16:04.292 --> 16:05.646
[Andy] You know, Asa and MJ,

16:05.647 --> 16:06.999
it does seem like we have

16:07.000 --> 16:08.209
the same conversation over

16:08.210 --> 16:09.417
and over again.

16:09.458 --> 16:10.851
- Have you ever looked
- at each other

16:10.875 --> 16:12.833
- And said what you
- really felt?

16:12.836 --> 16:14.375
MJ unfortunately,

16:14.376 --> 16:15.917
so many of her decisions

16:15.958 --> 16:17.792
- are based on,
- like, jealousy.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.166
You're so wrong.

16:19.167 --> 16:20.459
MJ's not a loyal friend,

16:20.460 --> 16:21.750
and she...

16:21.792 --> 16:23.166
I'm not?

16:23.167 --> 16:24.684
- I let you finish,
- let me finish. No, you're not.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.833
- For example, everybody here
- knows how much I'm working.

16:26.836 --> 16:27.999
Including me.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.125
MJ goes and knocks

16:29.126 --> 16:30.250
on every door she can,

16:30.292 --> 16:31.476
- trying to, like, sabotage
- what I'm doing...

16:31.500 --> 16:32.500
Excuse me?

16:32.501 --> 16:33.643
- Talking sh...
- About it, yeah.

16:33.667 --> 16:34.875
I knock on a door?

16:34.876 --> 16:36.083
Metaphorically.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.434
- I was...
- She doesn't root for me,

16:37.458 --> 16:38.643
- She doesn't want me to win.
- First of all...

16:38.667 --> 16:39.833
- And you know how hard
- I'm working,

16:39.836 --> 16:41.229
Why don't you want me

16:41.230 --> 16:42.625
to have what I have?

16:42.667 --> 16:44.125
- You're not happy
- for my success

16:44.167 --> 16:45.667
- But I'm always rooting for
- you and for your happiness.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.375
Come on, man.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.208
- You need to get with
- yourself for a second, sorry.

16:49.211 --> 16:50.875
So this is the weekend

16:50.876 --> 16:52.541
on Mother's Day

16:52.542 --> 16:53.684
on "Watch What Happens Live."

16:53.708 --> 16:54.851
- Have you heard of
- the show before?

16:54.875 --> 16:56.375
- Okay.
- My favorite show.

16:56.417 --> 16:58.105
Yeah. So when you played

16:58.106 --> 16:59.792
the game with my mother

16:59.833 --> 17:01.396
where you asked her what advice

17:01.397 --> 17:02.958
would she give to each person...

17:03.000 --> 17:04.184
- Yes, we're gonna
- talk about that.

17:04.208 --> 17:05.792
- That's what she's
- referring to.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.500
Asa shouldn't stop the show

17:07.501 --> 17:09.167
for her personal benefit.

17:09.208 --> 17:10.708
She wants to make money,

17:10.709 --> 17:12.208
uh, do it on her own time.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.041
My mom insulted you,

17:14.042 --> 17:16.226
- and I'm sorry that you didn't
- take that as a compliment.

17:16.250 --> 17:17.396
My mother saying that

17:17.397 --> 17:18.541
you're using the show

17:18.542 --> 17:20.355
to sell caftans should have been

17:20.356 --> 17:22.167
an entrepreneurial's wet dream.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.667
But you were offended and

17:23.668 --> 17:25.125
you told me that it was me

17:25.167 --> 17:27.042
- who put those words
- in her mouth.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.313
Number one... number one...

17:28.314 --> 17:29.582
That is a problem, Asa.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.583
- Number one, you need
- to stop this behavior.

17:30.586 --> 17:31.768
- When you care
- about a person...

17:31.792 --> 17:32.917
- I don't want this
- type of friendship.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.018
- I don't need to
- stop any behavior.

17:34.042 --> 17:35.268
- My behavior needs
- to call you out...

17:35.292 --> 17:36.542
There it is.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.250
Because you were being

17:38.251 --> 17:39.916
a low-down person

17:39.917 --> 17:41.851
- who is just grabbing at straws.
- That is a problem.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.082
Are you done yelling?

17:43.083 --> 17:44.351
- You should have never,
- ever, ever thought that

17:44.375 --> 17:46.208
- I was capable of
- putting any words...

17:46.250 --> 17:47.351
- First of all...
- First of all, your mom...

17:47.375 --> 17:48.667
In, in Vida's ear.

17:48.708 --> 17:49.667
- We're gonna talk about
- that when Vida comes out.

17:49.708 --> 17:50.750
- I would never,
- ever be able to do that.

17:50.753 --> 17:52.750
- You're a jealous,
- bitter girl.

17:52.753 --> 17:54.083
- Okay.
- Stop it.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.893
- You want your friends
- to treat you like this.

17:55.917 --> 17:57.000
Come up with another

17:57.001 --> 17:58.082
word other than "jealous".

17:58.083 --> 18:00.083
- Okay, sh, sh, sh,
- you're giving me a headache.

18:00.086 --> 18:01.250
- Damn.
- Last word.

18:01.292 --> 18:02.438
You're thin-skinned.

18:02.439 --> 18:03.583
All right, okay.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.208
- Your skin is thin,
- you have no skin.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.375
Okay.

18:06.417 --> 18:07.559
- We're never gonna
- be friends again.

18:07.583 --> 18:08.893
- Great, I have no skin.
- And I don't want to.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.208
Wow.

18:10.250 --> 18:11.500
I'm sorry, with all

18:11.501 --> 18:12.750
due respect, f... you.

18:13.750 --> 18:14.875
[Voiceover] Coming up...

18:14.917 --> 18:16.792
- Nobody got a thank you
- after that weekend.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.124
I was in a horrible place.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.792
- You didn't see how
- all of us love you,

18:19.833 --> 18:21.101
- And f... ing were
- there by your side?

18:21.125 --> 18:27.042
You just say thank you.

18:27.125 --> 18:28.813
I'm sorry, with all

18:28.814 --> 18:30.042
due respect, f... you.

18:30.125 --> 18:31.667
No more, game over, goodbye.
Good to know.

18:32.917 --> 18:34.458
- I wanna hear from the
- man in the middle.

18:34.461 --> 18:35.875
Reza, you're obviously great

18:35.876 --> 18:37.292
friends with both of them.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.624
I hate where they're at,

18:39.625 --> 18:41.125
but I understand and

18:41.126 --> 18:42.624
feel for both of them.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.521
If I were MJ, I would

18:44.522 --> 18:46.417
want Asa to know that

18:46.458 --> 18:47.875
I couldn't put words

18:47.876 --> 18:49.291
in Vida's mouth

18:49.292 --> 18:50.792
if my life depended on me.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.333
The other way around,

18:52.334 --> 18:53.832
I would want MJ,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.479
when my mom says vile,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.125
disgusting things,

18:57.167 --> 18:58.333
- that bitch should
- have been like,

18:58.336 --> 18:59.832
"Mom, shut the f... up,

18:59.833 --> 19:01.750
- stop talking sh...,
- "you're toxic."

19:01.792 --> 19:04.000
- My point isn't about Vida.
- Vida is a bitter old lady.

19:04.003 --> 19:05.184
- Like, I don't care
- what she says about me.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.601
- Watch your mouth about
- my mom, by the way.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.833
- Well, she doesn't
- watch her mouth about anybody,

19:07.836 --> 19:08.976
- So that's what you,
- that's what you get.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
- You know what, but
- when it comes down

19:10.003 --> 19:11.667
- To hating on me,
- you needed to find...

19:11.668 --> 19:12.768
- But I wasn't finished... I... I
- wasn't finished with my point.

19:12.792 --> 19:13.976
- But that's nothing
- worse than what

19:14.000 --> 19:15.333
- You would say about your mom.
- [Asa] Andy.

19:15.336 --> 19:16.643
- I can say about my mom,
- she can say about her mom.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.917
Mike, do you think Asa

19:17.918 --> 19:19.166
and MJ can repair things?

19:19.167 --> 19:20.333
- Absolutely.
- Hell, no.

19:20.375 --> 19:21.667
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

19:21.670 --> 19:22.730
F..., man, we've been

19:22.731 --> 19:23.792
through so much together,

19:23.833 --> 19:25.684
- there's not one thing we
- haven't said about each other,

19:25.708 --> 19:27.434
- Accused each other of,
- insulted each other.

19:27.458 --> 19:28.417
That's true.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.479
I mean, and we

19:29.480 --> 19:30.499
always bounce back.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.792
Okay, I wanna move on.

19:32.833 --> 19:34.688
It is always a joy to

19:34.689 --> 19:36.541
see you guys traveling.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.208
Actually, sometimes it's joy

19:38.250 --> 19:39.354
and the other times

19:39.355 --> 19:40.458
it's a cautionary tale.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.771
This season you went

19:41.772 --> 19:43.042
to Palm Springs and Belize,

19:43.083 --> 19:44.958
you went camping.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.874
Who let Golnesa drive the RV?

19:46.875 --> 19:48.375
- Uh, dude, she wouldn't
- let anybody else drive.

19:48.378 --> 19:49.541
She sat in the car.

19:49.542 --> 19:51.500
- Whoa, whoa, watch
- the f... ing road!

19:51.542 --> 19:52.500
( Screaming )

19:52.542 --> 19:53.625
( cars honking )

19:53.667 --> 19:54.958
When you're driving,

19:55.000 --> 19:56.143
- you don't realize what's
- happening back there.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.500
Mother f... er.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.771
Reza, what was the spray

19:59.772 --> 20:01.000
that you used in the RV?

20:01.042 --> 20:02.792
- Oh, God.
- It was called Ass Spray.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.271
I have liquid sharts

20:04.272 --> 20:05.708
and liquid ass,

20:05.750 --> 20:08.667
so why not start the pranks?

20:08.708 --> 20:09.874
Someone took a sh...

20:09.875 --> 20:11.167
Oh, I smell it.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.458
It was so bad, Andy, oh.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.374
It smelled like sh...

20:14.375 --> 20:16.250
Get it away from me!

20:16.292 --> 20:17.334
Shervin, what's

20:17.335 --> 20:18.375
the appropriate punishment

20:18.417 --> 20:19.917
for Reza spraying that?

20:19.958 --> 20:21.271
He already punished me,

20:21.272 --> 20:22.583
he collapsed my tent.

20:22.625 --> 20:25.667
( Shouting )

20:28.417 --> 20:30.167
Oh, hell, no.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.313
Do you know what it feels

20:31.314 --> 20:32.417
like to be three fat people

20:32.458 --> 20:34.000
- in a tent with
- the tent on you?

20:34.042 --> 20:35.684
- You guys aren't fat.
- It's not... I'm just saying.

20:35.708 --> 20:36.667
Pleasantly plump.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.667
Reza, what's it - like going

20:37.708 --> 20:39.101
- Through an airport
- with this group?

20:39.125 --> 20:40.646
Golnesa will say, like, bomb,

20:40.647 --> 20:42.167
and, like, say crazy things.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.416
I have an issue with airports.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.917
- We have never reentered
- the country without

20:44.920 --> 20:46.292
Going through the

20:46.293 --> 20:47.667
extra-line, swear to God.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.583
- She hides a pizza
- or a hot dog in her purse,

20:49.586 --> 20:50.833
Tries to smuggle it.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.375
- She has everything
- in her purse.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.749
A breakfast burrito.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.101
- My... my, uh, hot dog
- doesn't leave home without it.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.708
It's like an Amex.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.934
- GG, didn't you get thrown out
- of the first class lounge

20:58.958 --> 21:00.292
At the Seoul airport

21:00.293 --> 21:01.625
on the way to Thailand?

21:01.667 --> 21:03.124
Oh my God, yeah.

21:03.125 --> 21:04.292
GG, where are you?

21:04.293 --> 21:05.458
I am really drunk.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.124
( laughter )

21:08.125 --> 21:09.583
( shouting )

21:12.792 --> 21:15.375
Ow!

21:15.417 --> 21:17.125
- Let's talk about
- the camping trip.

21:17.167 --> 21:19.042
- Michele K from
- Kansas City said,

21:19.083 --> 21:21.333
"GG, did you actually gain

21:21.334 --> 21:23.583
anything from the GG-vention?"

21:23.625 --> 21:24.957
Mm.

21:24.958 --> 21:26.393
- You didn't see
- how all of us love you

21:26.417 --> 21:27.458
- And f... ing were there
- by your side?

21:27.461 --> 21:28.750
You didn't gain that?

21:28.792 --> 21:30.521
Be open to your friends

21:30.522 --> 21:32.250
pointing out some of your flaws,

21:32.292 --> 21:33.709
because they see in you what you

21:33.710 --> 21:35.124
don't see in yourself sometimes.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.188
As your friends

21:37.189 --> 21:39.250
we also wanna help you

21:39.292 --> 21:42.667
get to a different place.

21:42.708 --> 21:44.292
I hope you gained something,

21:44.333 --> 21:45.500
- because I really wanna
- clarify it for you.

21:45.503 --> 21:46.666
We came there for you.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.500
- I hate camping,
- and the only reason I came

21:48.503 --> 21:49.917
Is because that's where you

21:49.918 --> 21:51.332
have your tranquility.

21:51.333 --> 21:52.333
Well, how did it feel

21:52.334 --> 21:53.333
watching that trip back?

21:53.334 --> 21:55.351
- Because you were kinda
- trashed for part of that trip.

21:55.375 --> 21:58.125
Uh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:58.167 --> 21:59.667
I'm happy,

21:59.668 --> 22:01.166
I'm happy, everyone's...

22:01.167 --> 22:02.625
I'm happy everyone's here.

22:02.667 --> 22:03.896
It was very hard

22:03.897 --> 22:05.125
for me to watch.

22:05.167 --> 22:07.313
I've always been a...

22:07.314 --> 22:09.458
A drinker and partier.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.166
Last year particularly

22:12.167 --> 22:13.813
I was drinking

22:13.814 --> 22:15.458
like a mad fish.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.209
Psychologically and emotionally,

22:17.210 --> 22:18.917
I wasn't able to see

22:18.958 --> 22:20.500
- what these people
- were saying to me,

22:20.503 --> 22:21.896
And I was so, like,

22:21.897 --> 22:23.292
this is not okay.

22:23.333 --> 22:24.938
Like, I can't accept this

22:24.939 --> 22:26.541
at this age, like, no, no, no.

22:26.542 --> 22:27.625
Are you still drinking

22:27.626 --> 22:28.707
and smoking heavily?

22:28.708 --> 22:30.375
No, no.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.542
- I think we made a difference,
- but if any one of us thought

22:32.545 --> 22:34.209
That overnight she was

22:34.210 --> 22:35.874
gonna snap out of it and go,

22:35.875 --> 22:37.208
- do a 180 and be
- 100 percent fine,

22:37.211 --> 22:39.208
- You're dreaming.
- No, you just say thank you.

22:39.250 --> 22:40.542
- Nobody got a thank you
- after that weekend.

22:40.545 --> 22:42.042
- If you're doing things
- for applause

22:42.045 --> 22:43.143
- Instead of the cause,
- then you know what?

22:43.167 --> 22:44.458
No.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.708
- I'm gonna apologize
- right now that while I was

22:45.711 --> 22:47.208
- In the depths of
- my f... ing hell...

22:47.211 --> 22:48.541
No.

22:48.542 --> 22:49.643
- I didn't come out and say
- thank you guys so much.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.041
Actually, no.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.042
- I'm sorry I couldn't
- say thank you for anything

22:52.045 --> 22:53.125
In that part

22:53.126 --> 22:54.208
of my life, nothing.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.125
I was in a horrible place.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.708
- You have gotten
- a lot better, though.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.893
- Lately I've been seeing,
- like, you're...

22:58.917 --> 23:00.375
Really?

23:00.417 --> 23:02.042
- You're on the right path,
- so I, I commend you for that.

23:02.045 --> 23:03.708
- I appreciate that,
- thank you.

23:03.750 --> 23:05.708
- What's your reaction
- to that, Rez?

23:05.750 --> 23:06.979
There's things that go on

23:06.980 --> 23:08.208
that are really happening,

23:08.250 --> 23:09.417
and there's things that

23:09.418 --> 23:10.582
go on in Golnesa's head.

23:10.583 --> 23:12.042
You wanna get dirty with me?

23:12.083 --> 23:13.601
- You've been getting dirty
- with me for a year, sweetie.

23:13.625 --> 23:14.749
You're mentally...

23:14.750 --> 23:16.250
- You've been getting
- really dirty.

23:16.292 --> 23:17.726
- You're mentally unstable.
- I've just kept my mouth shut.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.417
- You're mentally unstable
- and I'm afraid of you.

23:19.420 --> 23:20.480
I am mentally unstable?

23:20.481 --> 23:21.542
What are you?

23:21.583 --> 23:22.917
- I'm afraid of you
- What are you?

23:22.920 --> 23:24.000
I'm worried about you.

23:24.001 --> 23:25.083
I'm...

23:25.125 --> 23:26.438
Okay, we're gonna move on,

23:26.439 --> 23:27.750
we're gonna move on.

23:27.792 --> 23:29.521
Mike, we saw the first

23:29.522 --> 23:31.249
blissful months

23:31.250 --> 23:32.667
of your marriage turn into

23:32.668 --> 23:34.082
a heartbreaking divorce.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.417
How are you doing?

23:35.458 --> 23:37.188
I stand before you a man

23:37.189 --> 23:38.916
who is, uh, very remorseful

23:38.917 --> 23:40.000
of what has transpired

23:40.001 --> 23:41.082
between me and my wife.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.749
I miss her very much.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.584
Um, I hurt someone who

23:44.585 --> 23:46.417
gave me their life,

23:46.458 --> 23:48.292
- gave me their heart,
- gave me their soul,

23:48.295 --> 23:49.792
And, um, I was

23:49.793 --> 23:51.291
irresponsible with it.

23:51.292 --> 23:52.625
- Are you officially divorced?
- Not yet.

23:52.628 --> 23:53.958
You're not.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.726
- No, it takes a long time
- to get divorced in California,

23:55.750 --> 23:57.124
And I'll tell you something.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.584
Um, the infidelity

23:58.585 --> 24:00.042
happened before we were even,

24:00.083 --> 24:01.771
uh, engaged, and... and

24:01.772 --> 24:03.457
the biggest thing I regret is

24:03.458 --> 24:04.958
that I took someone

24:04.959 --> 24:06.458
who I really loved

24:06.500 --> 24:08.146
more than anyone in the world,

24:08.147 --> 24:09.791
I took her for granted.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.458
You met her five years ago.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.646
When did you know

24:12.647 --> 24:13.792
she was the one?

24:13.833 --> 24:14.896
So clichÃ©, but you just

24:14.897 --> 24:15.958
know when you know.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.063
Like, we met and we

24:17.064 --> 24:18.124
started dating,

24:18.125 --> 24:19.375
and she told me, she's like,

24:19.376 --> 24:20.625
"I'm gonna marry you."

24:20.667 --> 24:22.768
- And then I remember one time we
- were laying in bed together.

24:22.792 --> 24:25.646
I was like, "I love you"

24:25.647 --> 24:28.500
and I do see myself

24:28.542 --> 24:30.000
- being with you for the rest
- "of our lives,"

24:30.003 --> 24:31.667
- And we started naming
- our children's names, and...

24:31.670 --> 24:33.000
Aw.

24:33.042 --> 24:34.309
- You know, we planned out
- our entire future together.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.333
Well in the last five

24:35.334 --> 24:36.334
years, Mike,

24:36.375 --> 24:38.333
- your relationship
- with Jessica has provided

24:38.375 --> 24:40.146
Us with some of the Shahs' most

24:40.147 --> 24:41.917
heartwarming moments.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.332
Take a look.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.792
I got Jessica's ring made.

24:44.793 --> 24:46.250
Ooh.

24:46.292 --> 24:48.250
- Whoa.
- Wow.

24:48.292 --> 24:49.396
You share some

24:49.397 --> 24:50.499
of the brightest...

24:50.500 --> 24:52.042
That was our first date.

24:52.043 --> 24:53.583
Moments of your life.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.750
Oh, honey.

24:54.792 --> 24:55.896
And you help each

24:55.897 --> 24:57.000
other build and grow.

24:57.042 --> 24:59.000
I love you.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.958
Will you marry me?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.292
- What?
- Will you marry me?

25:05.333 --> 25:06.583
I love you!

25:06.584 --> 25:07.833
Woo!

25:07.875 --> 25:10.833
Oh my God!

25:12.083 --> 25:14.875
( Dance music )

25:17.542 --> 25:18.709
They say when you know,

25:18.710 --> 25:19.874
you know, but it wasn't

25:19.875 --> 25:21.104
until I met you that I

25:21.105 --> 25:22.333
actually believed that.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.184
- My only regret is that
- I didn't meet you sooner

25:24.208 --> 25:25.625
In my life, but from

25:25.626 --> 25:27.041
this day forward I promise

25:27.042 --> 25:28.851
- to be everything you could
- want in a husband.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.208
This Shabbat dinner is like

25:31.250 --> 25:32.521
mine and Jessica's coming out

25:32.522 --> 25:33.792
party to the group.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.271
I genuinely, with

25:35.272 --> 25:36.708
all of my heart,

25:36.750 --> 25:37.979
love Jessica, and I want

25:37.980 --> 25:39.207
her to be with me

25:39.208 --> 25:42.292
'til the day that I'm dead.

25:45.833 --> 25:47.375
It's really sad.

25:47.417 --> 25:49.707
I f... ed up.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.684
- I've never felt this way
- about someone in my life.

25:51.708 --> 25:54.875
She was, um...

25:56.042 --> 25:57.542
- So there've been
- all these photos

25:57.583 --> 25:59.083
Of Jessica's new boyfriend.

25:59.125 --> 26:00.354
She thought Mike was

26:00.355 --> 26:01.583
the gravy train, and that...

26:01.625 --> 26:03.500
- That's not true.
- You have to protect her.

26:03.542 --> 26:07.396
No, I don't have

26:07.397 --> 26:11.250
to do anything.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.250
I f... ed up.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.750
I've never felt this way
about someone in my life.

26:15.750 --> 26:18.417
It was just two kids crazy in

26:18.418 --> 26:21.082
love, and realized that,

26:21.083 --> 26:23.042
dude, you're my soulmate.

26:23.083 --> 26:24.417
And I allowed myself

26:24.418 --> 26:25.749
to still mess up,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.250
- and that's what
- I'm upset about.

26:27.292 --> 26:29.209
A woman needs to be cherished

26:29.210 --> 26:31.124
and loved, tons of attention,

26:31.125 --> 26:33.583
sex, compliments.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.709
And I lacked in a lot

26:34.710 --> 26:35.792
of those departments,

26:35.833 --> 26:37.208
and if I had a chance

26:37.209 --> 26:38.583
to redo the whole thing

26:38.625 --> 26:40.209
I would never allow those

26:40.210 --> 26:41.792
mistakes to happen again.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.313
Well, Mike, as much as you and

26:43.314 --> 26:44.792
Jessica showed us great joy,

26:44.833 --> 26:47.208
you also showed great sorrow.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.563
You've been separated,

26:48.564 --> 26:49.875
you're not living together.

26:52.625 --> 26:54.542
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.958
- I don't even know where
- Jessica is.

26:55.961 --> 26:57.292
Where is she?

26:57.293 --> 26:58.625
She's in Orange County.

26:58.667 --> 27:01.624
Why?

27:01.625 --> 27:03.708
I like your shoes.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.042
I will out you right now.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.417
Yeah, well, you already did.

27:06.418 --> 27:07.750
Okay, I did?

27:07.792 --> 27:08.792
- You did, look what you...
- That you cheated on me?

27:08.795 --> 27:10.083
Let's talk about it.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.813
I f... ed up, and I f... ing

27:11.814 --> 27:13.499
feel horrible about it.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.500
I see Jessica with no ring on,

27:15.501 --> 27:17.499
looking fine as f...

27:17.500 --> 27:18.959
Titties out, smoky eyes,

27:18.960 --> 27:20.417
coochie cutters,

27:20.458 --> 27:23.000
like, having a good old time.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.499
She's gone.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.458
( Screaming )

27:27.500 --> 27:29.334
I've f... ing tried everything

27:29.335 --> 27:31.166
to make this work at this point,

27:31.167 --> 27:33.500
- to make up for the mistakes
- I made while we were together,

27:33.503 --> 27:35.666
And I've gotten nothing back.

27:35.667 --> 27:36.667
Give me something

27:36.668 --> 27:37.667
with your arms.

27:37.668 --> 27:39.625
So what do you do?

27:39.626 --> 27:41.583
What do you do?

27:41.625 --> 27:43.101
- How much more can
- you fight for something

27:43.125 --> 27:46.792
That is a lost cause?

27:49.208 --> 27:50.479
Why did you hide Jessica's

27:50.480 --> 27:51.750
leaving from the group?

27:51.792 --> 27:54.125
There's certain things

27:54.126 --> 27:56.458
in life that, justifiably so,

27:56.500 --> 27:57.875
- I don't need to share
- with my friends.

27:57.878 --> 28:00.208
- Well, they're your best
- friends and your wife left you.

28:00.211 --> 28:03.041
Yeah, so what?

28:03.042 --> 28:04.500
You know...

28:04.542 --> 28:05.708
- Did you think you could repair
- it and they would never know?

28:05.711 --> 28:07.208
- Absolutely, I... that's
- what I wanted to do.

28:07.211 --> 28:08.708
- That's what I think it was.
- You wanted to clean it up.

28:08.711 --> 28:10.851
- Uh, she said, "Go to therapy,
- get help, and I'll come back,"

28:10.875 --> 28:12.476
- And I was like, "Okay,"
- f... it, I'm gonna get therapy

28:12.500 --> 28:14.292
- And everything's
- "gonna be great."

28:14.333 --> 28:16.292
- So there've been all
- these photos out there

28:16.333 --> 28:17.583
Of Jessica

28:17.584 --> 28:18.833
with new boyfriends.

28:18.875 --> 28:20.854
There were stories

28:20.855 --> 28:22.833
that she was engaged?

28:22.875 --> 28:23.833
- No, it's okay,
- let's talk about it.

28:23.875 --> 28:25.292
- I mean, the world
- wants to know.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.542
- I'm assuming that that had
- to kill you, to have her...

28:26.545 --> 28:27.792
Oh.

28:27.833 --> 28:30.042
- Running around,
- dating someone in the public.

28:30.045 --> 28:31.709
The breakup wasn't as hard

28:31.710 --> 28:33.374
as seeing her move on.

28:33.375 --> 28:35.354
MJ, you were tweeting about

28:35.355 --> 28:37.333
Jessica's new boyfriend.

28:37.375 --> 28:38.792
You said, "I'm not gonna lie",

28:38.793 --> 28:40.208
if certain people decided

28:40.250 --> 28:41.792
to go straight from a husband to

28:41.793 --> 28:43.333
another man for a Range Rover,

28:43.375 --> 28:45.042
"who am I to judge?"

28:45.083 --> 28:46.500
âª getThatCarHun.

28:46.501 --> 28:47.917
Get that car.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.333
Oh my God.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.893
- Jessica tweeted back,
- "Bitch, are you bored yet?"

28:50.917 --> 28:52.167
You bounce from dick

28:52.168 --> 28:53.416
to dick for no car.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.500
I didn't leave

28:54.501 --> 28:55.583
my husband for anyone.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.083
"Keep running your mouth."

28:57.125 --> 28:58.500
Okay, so that's

28:58.501 --> 28:59.875
the dirty side of Jessica.

28:59.917 --> 29:01.250
She thought Mike was

29:01.251 --> 29:02.582
the gravy train, and that...

29:02.583 --> 29:03.875
- That's not true.
- Mike...

29:03.917 --> 29:05.250
- That's not true.
- That's my opinion.

29:05.253 --> 29:06.375
Dude, she has, she has...

29:06.417 --> 29:07.726
- You have to protect her,
- I don't.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.018
- No, I don't have to do
- anything, she's my ex.

29:09.042 --> 29:10.416
I'm just telling you.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.101
- Well, Reza, you got into
- it with her on Twitter.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.750
- She put it... she put
- it on Instagram.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.059
- You... you...
- So I'm just recounting that.

29:15.083 --> 29:16.582
I know, no problem.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.393
- Jessica, Jessica tweeted,
- "Reza to the rescue,

29:18.417 --> 29:20.021
Made for reality TV

29:20.022 --> 29:21.624
ass bitch.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.084
Thank God for me your show

29:23.085 --> 29:24.542
is still around.

29:24.583 --> 29:26.125
- You bitches would have
- "nothing to say."

29:26.128 --> 29:27.854
Reza responded, "Love when"

29:27.855 --> 29:29.583
an irrelevant gold-digger

29:29.625 --> 29:31.584
from Inland Empire thinks

29:31.585 --> 29:33.542
Shahs is her show.

29:33.583 --> 29:35.854
It's not called

29:35.855 --> 29:38.124
"Gold-digging Hoes."

29:38.125 --> 29:39.792
What do you want me to say?

29:39.833 --> 29:41.458
- Reza, do you think
- she's a gold-digger?

29:41.461 --> 29:42.833
I'm... don't have a problem

29:42.834 --> 29:44.208
with the guy she was dating,

29:44.250 --> 29:46.768
- and actually, I don't wanna
- say anything negative about him,

29:46.792 --> 29:48.458
- Because I don't wanna
- end up dead.

29:48.461 --> 29:49.958
- Yeah, I don't wanna
- end up dead.

29:49.961 --> 29:51.500
But to go from this guy

29:51.501 --> 29:53.042
who looks like this,

29:53.083 --> 29:54.188
who comes from a family

29:54.189 --> 29:55.292
that he comes from,

29:55.333 --> 29:56.917
and is like...

29:59.458 --> 30:00.667
Yes.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.000
- To go with a mongoloid
- for a Rolls Royce

30:02.003 --> 30:03.499
And a Chanel bag, what?

30:03.500 --> 30:04.833
- It's like MJ said, she thought
- she was coming in

30:04.836 --> 30:06.792
- On some money and fame.
- Rez.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.000
The reason why

30:08.001 --> 30:09.167
Jessica's mad at me is

30:09.208 --> 30:11.417
because I said that I felt bad

30:11.418 --> 30:13.625
for my friend because

30:13.667 --> 30:15.084
the whole time he was trying

30:15.085 --> 30:16.500
to get his wife back there

30:16.542 --> 30:18.000
- was another guy
- in the picture.

30:18.003 --> 30:19.584
And Mike was thinking there was

30:19.585 --> 30:21.166
something going on as well.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.917
Who are you talking to so,

30:22.918 --> 30:24.667
like, let me see?

30:24.708 --> 30:27.333
Jessica?

30:27.375 --> 30:29.292
- I'm not showing you and
- I'm not telling you.

30:31.208 --> 30:32.643
- You thought at that point
- she was cheating, yeah.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.000
She was dating.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.601
- No, I don't... f... it.
- I think she was punishing him.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.583
- Let's not call it cheating.
- She was dating.

30:37.625 --> 30:38.625
She had her eyes

30:38.626 --> 30:39.626
on another man.

30:39.667 --> 30:40.833
- I think she did it
- with no intention

30:40.836 --> 30:41.874
Of getting back with him.

30:41.875 --> 30:43.208
- I think she did it
- to punish him.

30:43.211 --> 30:44.542
To Jessica's defense,

30:44.543 --> 30:45.874
I did something that upset her,

30:45.875 --> 30:47.188
so to get back at me she did

30:47.189 --> 30:48.500
something to upset me.

30:48.542 --> 30:51.375
The punishment fit the crime,

30:51.417 --> 30:52.563
and she punished me

30:52.564 --> 30:53.707
and continued to punish me.

30:53.708 --> 30:55.018
- I think it's sweet,
- the way you protect her.

30:55.042 --> 30:56.375
And I did it the day.

30:56.417 --> 30:57.625
She was my wife and I had,

30:57.626 --> 30:58.833
and I will, still to this day,

30:58.875 --> 31:00.708
- protect her,
- because she's been there

31:00.750 --> 31:02.125
- With me through
- thick and thin.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.726
- And at the same time,
- I know where my friends

31:03.750 --> 31:04.708
Are coming from.

31:04.750 --> 31:06.167
Have you been dating?

31:06.208 --> 31:08.374
I have, selfishly,

31:08.375 --> 31:10.207
because I'm really not ready

31:10.208 --> 31:11.458
to give myself emotionally

31:11.459 --> 31:12.707
to somebody.

31:12.708 --> 31:14.042
- Maybe physically,
- but emotionally,

31:14.045 --> 31:15.167
It's been very hard, like...

31:15.208 --> 31:16.542
- So you've been messing
- around with...

31:16.545 --> 31:18.208
- Yeah, just dating,
- and then when they get

31:18.211 --> 31:20.143
- A little too serious,
- I just... I'm like, uh...

31:20.167 --> 31:21.125
- You have to
- take your time, Mikey.

31:21.167 --> 31:22.333
Yeah, I'm still healing.

31:22.375 --> 31:23.393
- Don't jump into
- another relationship.

31:23.417 --> 31:24.708
I can't do it.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.583
- Well, it must feel great
- to have... feel all of your

31:26.586 --> 31:28.101
- Friends rallying around
- you, right?

31:28.125 --> 31:29.813
It's, uh, it's definitely

31:29.814 --> 31:31.500
been my only saving grace,

31:31.542 --> 31:33.262
- to have my friends
- and family around me.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.355
When I was going through

31:34.356 --> 31:35.416
my darkest moment, I mean,

31:35.417 --> 31:37.518
- I was... there was a point
- in my life where I was just

31:37.542 --> 31:38.813
Sleeping on the couch,

31:38.814 --> 31:40.082
waking up on the couch,

31:40.083 --> 31:41.583
- waiting for days
- to end so that,

31:41.586 --> 31:43.000
- You know, I could
- just hopefully

31:43.042 --> 31:44.917
- Snap out of whatever the f...
- I was going through.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.084
And it took months,

31:46.085 --> 31:47.250
and believe it or not,

31:47.292 --> 31:48.834
a lot of Justin Bieber,

31:48.835 --> 31:50.375
which is funny.

31:50.417 --> 31:51.851
- I listened to
- Justin Bieber's album

31:51.875 --> 31:53.833
- And would cry like
- a little baby.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.833
- Really?
- For months, yeah.

31:55.875 --> 31:57.249
Do you still love her?

31:57.250 --> 31:59.083
- Of course I do, you can't
- turn love on and off.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.708
Will you ever marry again?

32:00.750 --> 32:01.917
Of course, I... I definitely

32:01.918 --> 32:03.082
wanna be married again

32:03.083 --> 32:04.875
- and have children
- and have a family.

32:04.917 --> 32:06.417
( Speaking foreign language )

32:06.458 --> 32:07.625
- All right, well,
- let's move on

32:07.626 --> 32:08.643
- Thank you.
- We wish you the best.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.208
Thank you very much.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.271
MJ, you're newly engaged,

32:12.272 --> 32:14.291
you have eggs in the freezer.

32:14.292 --> 32:15.625
You have come a long way

32:15.626 --> 32:16.958
since season one, when...

32:17.000 --> 32:18.291
Yeah.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.893
- As a bridesmaid you tried
- to talk the bride

32:19.917 --> 32:21.417
Out of getting married.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.708
Wedding equals divorce.

32:23.750 --> 32:24.893
- You're not serious.
- I'm your bridesmaid.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.124
I don't believe that.

32:26.125 --> 32:27.354
Why go through all

32:27.355 --> 32:28.583
of this just so that you

32:28.625 --> 32:30.083
can get a divorce one day?

32:30.125 --> 32:31.625
How many frogs

32:31.626 --> 32:33.125
did you have to kiss

32:33.167 --> 32:35.124
before finding your prince?

32:35.125 --> 32:36.917
- Not enough.
- Yeah.

32:36.958 --> 32:38.143
- I would love to
- have been more of, like,

32:38.167 --> 32:39.625
A whore before I got

32:39.626 --> 32:41.083
married or engaged and...

32:41.125 --> 32:42.291
I love that.

32:42.292 --> 32:44.583
- And when you first met
- Tommy, he had a... an erection?

32:44.625 --> 32:46.604
Oh, uh, so I stepped out of

32:46.605 --> 32:48.583
my Uber and I looked down,

32:48.625 --> 32:49.646
and I was like,

32:49.647 --> 32:50.666
"Do you have a hard-on?"

32:50.667 --> 32:52.792
And he was like, owned it,

32:52.833 --> 32:54.333
- because that's what Tommy
- does with everything.

32:54.336 --> 32:55.833
And I was like, "Okay."

32:55.834 --> 32:57.332
And then we walked in.

32:57.333 --> 32:59.229
You went into his apartment

32:59.230 --> 33:01.125
with he and his erection?

33:01.167 --> 33:02.768
- The first time I met,
- yeah, the first time we met.

33:02.792 --> 33:05.458
Did you have sex that day?

33:05.500 --> 33:07.768
- So we kinda like hung out and
- watched "Friends" for a while.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.167
- Because nothing gets you
- in the mood better than,

33:09.170 --> 33:11.583
You know, Chandler.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.459
He's like, "f... this",

33:13.460 --> 33:15.292
let's get to sex already."

33:15.333 --> 33:17.146
Uh, Reza, what's your

33:17.147 --> 33:18.958
diagnosis of this relationship?

33:19.000 --> 33:20.625
MJ's a motherf... er,

33:20.626 --> 33:22.250
she's so powerful.

33:22.292 --> 33:24.480
She needs a gritty

33:24.481 --> 33:26.666
New Yorker from Queens

33:26.667 --> 33:28.000
that's gonna be able to, like,

33:28.001 --> 33:29.333
crack the whip on her

33:29.375 --> 33:30.709
or she will f... ing

33:30.710 --> 33:32.042
lay you out like a pancake,

33:32.083 --> 33:33.563
take her dick out, and

33:33.564 --> 33:35.041
piss on you, and walk away.

33:35.042 --> 33:36.458
- You're for it.
- I'm for it.

33:36.500 --> 33:37.542
He's crazy.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.643
- Has Vida changed
- her mind about Tommy?

33:38.667 --> 33:40.208
- No.
- Okay.

33:40.211 --> 33:42.375
Well, she and Tommy are gonna

33:42.376 --> 33:44.541
be joining us after the break.

33:44.542 --> 33:46.000
We're all gonna get whipped.

33:46.001 --> 33:47.458
Okay, all right.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.542
I'm wearing deodorant,

33:48.543 --> 33:49.583
thank God.

33:51.042 --> 33:52.042
Vida, are you excited

33:52.043 --> 33:53.042
to be a grandma?

33:53.043 --> 33:54.708
- Who's gonna take care
- of the baby?

33:54.711 --> 33:56.041
Not you.

33:56.042 --> 33:57.542
- You think I'm gonna tolerate
- that type of criticism?

33:57.545 --> 34:05.545
No way, man, no way.

34:06.083 --> 34:07.542
You're right next to Tommy.

34:07.625 --> 34:08.665
Hallo, everybody, hello.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.208
- Hi Vida Joon.
- You look so nice.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.417
How have you been?

34:12.418 --> 34:13.583
Hi, Vida Joon.

34:13.625 --> 34:14.750
- Hello, hello, how are you?
- How are you?

34:14.751 --> 34:15.750
You guys.

34:15.751 --> 34:16.916
( Singing )

34:16.917 --> 34:18.875
- You guys always
- sing this song,

34:18.917 --> 34:21.000
Which is only for the wedding.

34:21.042 --> 34:22.958
It really irritates me.

34:24.125 --> 34:25.833
- Vida Joon,
- good to see you again.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.082
Thank you.

34:27.083 --> 34:28.229
Tommy, welcome to your

34:28.230 --> 34:29.375
first Shah's reunion.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.667
Thank you.

34:30.708 --> 34:31.813
Joe from Long Island

34:31.814 --> 34:32.934
tweeted, "Tommy, why do you"

34:32.958 --> 34:34.188
always have to yell when

34:34.189 --> 34:35.416
"you're talking?"

34:35.417 --> 34:37.542
- That's just the way I talk.
- Yeah, I'm loud.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.250
- I've been hearing that
- since I'm a little kid.

34:39.253 --> 34:41.000
Vida, I know in the show

34:41.001 --> 34:42.749
you made it very clear that

34:42.750 --> 34:45.084
you didn't approve of MJ

34:45.085 --> 34:47.417
and Tommy's relationship.

34:47.458 --> 34:49.167
- You know, when
- I first met Tommy,

34:49.208 --> 34:50.750
- I thought that it
- was a fling.

34:50.753 --> 34:52.334
And then after a couple

34:52.335 --> 34:53.917
of months I realized

34:53.958 --> 34:55.792
- that it was more than
- just as a friend.

34:55.795 --> 34:56.875
He's not... he's not

34:56.876 --> 34:57.957
a good match for you.

34:57.958 --> 34:59.042
Tommy moved in,

34:59.043 --> 35:00.125
and now we live together.

35:00.167 --> 35:01.393
- How could you
- do such a thing?

35:01.417 --> 35:02.938
I'm gonna get pregnant

35:02.939 --> 35:04.457
one day, with Tommy.

35:04.458 --> 35:05.625
Are you okay?

35:05.667 --> 35:07.625
- He's not the guy for you.
- I love him.

35:07.628 --> 35:09.875
No, you'll run out of his

35:09.876 --> 35:12.124
love soon, I promise you.

35:12.125 --> 35:13.459
That's a beautiful ring.

35:13.460 --> 35:14.792
Will you marry me?

35:14.833 --> 35:16.458
- Of course I will
- marry you, baby.

35:16.500 --> 35:17.688
Mercedes, look

35:17.689 --> 35:18.875
what he's doing.

35:18.917 --> 35:21.125
I shouldn't even come.

35:21.167 --> 35:22.813
I'm thinking now that

35:22.814 --> 35:24.458
you're gonna come here today

35:24.500 --> 35:25.729
and you're gonna say

35:25.730 --> 35:26.957
you're very excited

35:26.958 --> 35:28.625
to welcome Tommy

35:28.626 --> 35:30.291
into your family.

35:30.292 --> 35:31.542
Am I right?

35:31.583 --> 35:33.832
No, you are not.

35:33.833 --> 35:36.250
Because, uh, the more I see and

35:36.251 --> 35:38.667
the more I hear from Tommy,

35:38.708 --> 35:40.521
makes me believe that I'm right

35:40.522 --> 35:42.332
in my opinion about him.

35:42.333 --> 35:43.813
Tommy, how's your

35:43.814 --> 35:45.292
relationship with Vida?

35:45.333 --> 35:46.934
- I could care less
- what she thinks about me.

35:46.958 --> 35:49.000
- The only person whose opinion
- matters to me

35:49.003 --> 35:50.500
Is this beautiful soul here.

35:50.542 --> 35:51.605
Barbara from

35:51.606 --> 35:52.667
Salt Lake City said,

35:52.708 --> 35:53.917
"Vida, approval has"

35:53.918 --> 35:55.125
to be earned.

35:55.167 --> 35:56.563
What has Tommy done to try

35:56.564 --> 35:57.958
"to win your approval?"

35:58.000 --> 35:59.250
He hasn't done it yet.

35:59.251 --> 36:00.500
He hasn't.

36:00.542 --> 36:01.605
I like people with

36:01.606 --> 36:02.667
a sense of morality.

36:02.708 --> 36:04.417
How is he immoral?

36:04.458 --> 36:06.167
When they were in Belize,

36:06.208 --> 36:07.271
taking that, uh,

36:07.272 --> 36:08.332
filthy picture.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.750
No!

36:09.751 --> 36:11.166
Your ass just got served.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.584
That ass needs to be

36:12.585 --> 36:13.999
in court in two weeks.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.542
( laughter )

36:15.583 --> 36:16.979
If you want to take

36:16.980 --> 36:18.374
a picture from the ass,

36:18.375 --> 36:20.084
use your own big,

36:20.085 --> 36:21.792
hanging ass.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.958
Leave Mercedes' ass alone.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.208
- She's an adult, though.
- You have to, at some point...

36:25.211 --> 36:26.375
No, and then

36:26.376 --> 36:27.541
she, uh, down in the pool,

36:27.542 --> 36:29.209
and, uh, you take

36:29.210 --> 36:30.874
a filthy picture from her

36:30.875 --> 36:32.792
- and you call it the art?
- Yeah.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.458
That's not art, Asa.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.854
Vida, are you ever gonna

36:35.855 --> 36:37.208
accept Tommy as MJ's husband?

36:37.250 --> 36:38.646
I have to see

36:38.647 --> 36:40.042
the big, uh, change.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.874
Will you go to the wedding?

36:41.875 --> 36:43.333
What wedding?

36:43.375 --> 36:45.042
- Mercedes already said
- that there is no date.

36:45.045 --> 36:46.684
- Yeah, well, when are
- you getting married?

36:46.708 --> 36:48.542
- June 2017.
- Congratulations.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.000
If everything goes straight.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.542
- That's awesome that you
- guys have a wedding date.

36:51.545 --> 36:55.333
Thank you.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.101
- So what's the next step
- in the baby plan?

36:57.125 --> 36:58.521
Vida, are you excited

36:58.522 --> 36:59.916
to be a grandma?

36:59.917 --> 37:01.750
- No.
- Yes.

37:01.792 --> 37:05.542
Andy, don't encourage them.

37:05.583 --> 37:07.875
First let them get married,

37:07.917 --> 37:09.875
- then let's see
- if they get along.

37:09.917 --> 37:11.146
Because who's gonna take

37:11.147 --> 37:12.375
care of the baby?

37:12.417 --> 37:13.749
You.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.083
- You think I'm gonna tolerate
- that type of criticism

37:15.086 --> 37:16.750
- That she gives to
- this beautiful angel?

37:16.753 --> 37:18.542
- I think... I think...
- And to my baby?

37:18.583 --> 37:19.875
No way, man, no way.

37:19.917 --> 37:21.250
- I think that you're
- really good with infants.

37:21.253 --> 37:22.416
No way.

37:22.417 --> 37:23.417
- And I think that
- you're gonna be amazing.

37:23.420 --> 37:24.833
We'll see. We'll see.

37:24.875 --> 37:25.917
- No, really, who's going
- to take care of the baby?

37:25.920 --> 37:27.417
- Catherine from Biloxi,
- Mississippi said,

37:27.420 --> 37:28.646
"MJ, do you think the need"

37:28.647 --> 37:29.875
to have a child of your own

37:29.917 --> 37:31.792
is a way to give what your

37:31.793 --> 37:33.667
mom never gave to you?

37:33.708 --> 37:35.104
To treat the baby the way

37:35.105 --> 37:36.500
"you wish to be treated?"

37:36.542 --> 37:37.834
I love... okay, the reason

37:37.835 --> 37:39.124
I wanna have a baby the most

37:39.125 --> 37:41.125
is because my dad is

37:41.126 --> 37:43.124
a really cool guy,

37:43.125 --> 37:44.521
and I would be the last

37:44.522 --> 37:45.917
of these two.

37:45.958 --> 37:47.708
So I'd like to have one

37:47.709 --> 37:49.457
more to keep this going.

37:49.458 --> 37:50.625
And it's too bad that

37:50.626 --> 37:51.791
I was an only child,

37:51.792 --> 37:53.625
so that's why I'd like to...

37:53.667 --> 37:54.792
You're gonna be an

37:54.793 --> 37:55.917
amazing, amazing mom.

37:58.167 --> 37:59.875
Why are you crying?

37:59.917 --> 38:01.355
You just asked me

38:01.356 --> 38:02.791
about having a...

38:02.792 --> 38:04.625
That makes you emotional.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.292
- So isn't that nice,
- when you see her

38:06.295 --> 38:07.375
Get so emotional about

38:07.376 --> 38:08.457
having a kid?

38:08.458 --> 38:09.458
Doesn't that make you see

38:09.459 --> 38:10.458
that this is something

38:10.459 --> 38:11.791
that she really...

38:11.792 --> 38:13.750
- Yes, but kids is
- a big responsibility.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.625
- Baby.
- Twenty-four hours.

38:15.667 --> 38:16.980
She's very emotional, talking

38:16.981 --> 38:18.291
about the idea of having a...

38:18.292 --> 38:19.750
- Baby.
- A baby.

38:19.792 --> 38:20.959
She's also thinking about

38:20.960 --> 38:22.125
all the love her dad.

38:22.167 --> 38:23.584
The nicest man on the planet.

38:23.585 --> 38:24.999
Sweetest guy you'll ever meet.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.500
- You're very close
- with your dad.

38:26.503 --> 38:28.083
- Yeah.
- Tell me.

38:28.125 --> 38:29.333
He raised me.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.333
- He was the guy that,
- you know, like,

38:31.336 --> 38:33.333
- Picked me up from
- nursery school.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.396
And, you know, she worked for

38:35.397 --> 38:37.417
the embassy, and no offense,

38:37.458 --> 38:38.563
Mom, but it was always

38:38.564 --> 38:39.666
me and my dad.

38:39.667 --> 38:40.792
So that relationship

38:40.793 --> 38:41.917
with my dad and me,

38:41.958 --> 38:43.500
- and being an only child,
- and being, like,

38:43.503 --> 38:44.813
The son that he never had,

38:44.814 --> 38:46.125
is, it's not a blood line

38:46.167 --> 38:47.625
that I'd care to end.

38:47.667 --> 38:48.980
So I would love to have

38:48.981 --> 38:50.292
a little child,

38:50.333 --> 38:51.646
and I don't care if

38:51.647 --> 38:52.958
it's a boy or a girl,

38:53.000 --> 38:54.476
- but I would love to
- see the offspring,

38:54.500 --> 38:56.229
If there's a glimmer of,

38:56.230 --> 38:57.958
you know, my dad in him,

38:58.000 --> 38:59.667
- and even Vida,
- and that's cool.

38:59.708 --> 39:00.750
And, like, I want that.

39:00.792 --> 39:01.832
( Speaking foreign language )

39:01.833 --> 39:03.309
- I think that, uh,
- you're justified

39:03.333 --> 39:05.226
- For how you feel in your
- crying, and I... and I love you,

39:05.250 --> 39:07.542
And it breaks my heart, because

39:07.543 --> 39:09.833
no one can walk in your shoes.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.292
If you're happy with Tommy,

39:11.333 --> 39:12.896
Tommy may not be the perfect

39:12.897 --> 39:14.458
match in a parent's eyes,

39:14.500 --> 39:16.041
you guys can make it work.

39:16.042 --> 39:17.292
Andy, I just

39:17.293 --> 39:18.541
wanna say something.

39:18.542 --> 39:19.792
First of all, Vida Joon

39:19.793 --> 39:21.041
has been in my life

39:21.042 --> 39:23.875
just as long as MJ has been.

39:23.917 --> 39:25.542
Her dad and mom

39:25.543 --> 39:27.167
knew I was gay

39:27.208 --> 39:28.875
before my mom and dad knew.

39:28.917 --> 39:30.374
Wow.

39:30.375 --> 39:31.834
They were there for me at

39:31.835 --> 39:33.292
a time when I wasn't ready

39:33.333 --> 39:35.167
- to have my parents
- be there for me.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.208
So I will always be indebted

39:37.209 --> 39:39.207
to MJ's mom and dad for that

39:39.208 --> 39:40.625
because the love

39:40.626 --> 39:42.041
and acceptance I got from them

39:42.042 --> 39:44.021
at a very young age

39:44.022 --> 39:46.000
was very crucial.

39:46.042 --> 39:47.480
How interesting that Reza

39:47.481 --> 39:48.917
got so much love and acceptance

39:48.958 --> 39:50.646
from your mom, yet that's

39:50.647 --> 39:52.333
just what you crave.

39:52.375 --> 39:55.000
Right.

39:55.042 --> 39:56.230
Vida has no problem

39:56.231 --> 39:57.417
expressing her views

39:57.458 --> 39:59.916
about MJ and about Tommy,

39:59.917 --> 40:01.084
but when she was on

40:01.085 --> 40:02.249
"Watch What Happens Live",

40:02.250 --> 40:04.000
she also shared her thoughts

40:04.001 --> 40:05.749
on the rest of you.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.084
Whoa. Whoa.

40:07.085 --> 40:08.417
Holy sh...

40:09.750 --> 40:10.834
You are young,

40:10.835 --> 40:11.916
you are good-looking,

40:11.917 --> 40:13.749
more beautiful than Jessica.

40:13.750 --> 40:15.667
Oh, Jessica's

40:15.668 --> 40:17.582
beautiful, though.

40:17.583 --> 40:22.125
One thing I will not stand for

40:22.126 --> 40:26.667
is sh... talking about my wife.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.417
In the interest of fairness,
when she was on

40:28.500 --> 40:29.540
"Watch What Happens Live",

40:30.333 --> 40:31.896
Vida also shared her thoughts

40:31.897 --> 40:33.457
on the rest of you.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.708
What piece of advice

40:34.709 --> 40:35.958
would you give GG?

40:36.000 --> 40:37.791
Stop being a victim.

40:37.792 --> 40:38.875
What advice would

40:38.876 --> 40:39.958
you give Mike?

40:40.000 --> 40:43.957
He's a confused dreamer.

40:43.958 --> 40:45.354
He's a confused dreamer,

40:45.355 --> 40:46.750
that's specific.

40:46.792 --> 40:49.791
Okay, what about Asa?

40:49.792 --> 40:51.459
Asa shouldn't stop the show

40:51.460 --> 40:53.124
for her personal benefit.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.750
If she wants to make money,

40:54.751 --> 40:56.375
she, uh, do it on her own time.

40:56.417 --> 40:58.271
Yes, enough

40:58.272 --> 41:00.124
with the caftans, Asa.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.000
Okay, what about Reza?

41:04.292 --> 41:06.999
And stop feeling superior.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.292
Okay, what about Shervin?

41:08.333 --> 41:10.333
Shervin, he's new in

41:10.334 --> 41:12.332
the show, and he's okay.

41:12.333 --> 41:13.499
I don't know him very well.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.000
- Okay.
- Uh, he's okay.

41:15.003 --> 41:16.125
He's okay.

41:16.167 --> 41:17.833
- Mike.
- Yes.

41:17.836 --> 41:19.063
Were you upset when Vida

41:19.064 --> 41:20.292
called you a confused dreamer?

41:20.333 --> 41:21.809
- I laughed. I even posted
- it on my Instagram.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.208
I think I got, like, 70,000

41:23.209 --> 41:24.583
views on it, so you're a hit.

41:24.625 --> 41:25.646
Thank you.

41:25.647 --> 41:26.666
Um, I'm not confused.

41:26.667 --> 41:27.730
Your perception

41:27.731 --> 41:28.792
of people is way off.

41:28.833 --> 41:30.500
- You need to... you need to
- fix your radar a little bit.

41:30.503 --> 41:31.834
You underestimate

41:31.835 --> 41:33.166
yourself very much these days.

41:33.167 --> 41:35.250
Because, uh, you are young,

41:35.292 --> 41:36.730
you are good-looking,

41:36.731 --> 41:38.166
more beautiful than Jessica.

41:38.167 --> 41:40.125
- Oh, Jessica's beautiful,
- though.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.813
One thing I will not stand for

41:43.814 --> 41:45.499
is sh... talking about my wife.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.667
- I just... I don't... I don't
- like this nonsense.

41:46.668 --> 41:47.667
- Okay. Okay.
- I won't stand for it.

41:47.668 --> 41:48.667
Okay.

41:48.668 --> 41:49.938
So Asa?

41:49.939 --> 41:51.207
Yes?

41:51.208 --> 41:52.792
Do you use the show for

41:52.793 --> 41:54.374
your own personal benefit?

41:54.375 --> 41:55.875
- I don't know what
- that even means.

41:55.878 --> 41:58.042
- The premise of the show is our
- lives, and this is my life.

41:58.045 --> 42:00.208
- Were you offended by that?
- No.

42:00.211 --> 42:01.542
- You were offended
- by Vida saying that.

42:01.545 --> 42:03.226
- You know, Vida, I love her
- and I respect her.

42:03.250 --> 42:04.375
She's MJ's mom.

42:04.417 --> 42:05.563
But I, you know,

42:05.564 --> 42:06.707
I think she's, um, critical,

42:06.708 --> 42:08.167
- and quite often,
- like, wrong.

42:08.208 --> 42:09.833
- So I, it doesn't
- really affect me,

42:09.875 --> 42:11.518
- And I don't have
- a relationship with her.

42:11.542 --> 42:13.292
On the show, did MJ tell

42:13.293 --> 42:15.041
you to say any of those things

42:15.042 --> 42:16.459
about anyone that you said?

42:16.460 --> 42:17.874
Never, never.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.207
No?

42:19.208 --> 42:20.208
For her to believe

42:20.209 --> 42:21.209
that I would not want

42:21.250 --> 42:22.438
what's best for you, and

42:22.439 --> 42:23.625
for you to believe that?

42:23.667 --> 42:25.375
- We know how close we are.
- Honestly, not fair.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.393
- And we know how much
- we love each other.

42:26.417 --> 42:27.542
Used to.

42:27.543 --> 42:28.667
But if... if...

42:28.708 --> 42:30.374
After what you said...

42:30.375 --> 42:32.083
- Keep saying things that
- you're gonna regret later.

42:32.086 --> 42:33.601
- Not to me, but to her.
- And you guys have...

42:33.625 --> 42:35.667
- I'm not gonna regret it.
- I promise you will.

42:38.750 --> 42:40.226
- [Voiceover] Tomorrow,
- the "Shahs of Sunset"

42:40.250 --> 42:41.708
Reunion continues.

42:41.750 --> 42:43.268
- The two of you
- have never hooked up?

42:43.292 --> 42:44.333
- No.
- No.

42:44.375 --> 42:45.518
- Come on.
- Hey, can I say it?

42:45.542 --> 42:47.083
- I don't think you
- respect women.

42:47.086 --> 42:48.917
- I love women.
- A little too much.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.917
- I feel like
- I've been so open.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.375
- You're being
- dramatic right now.

42:52.417 --> 42:53.684
- I don't have
- anything to hide.

42:53.708 --> 42:55.059
- It felt like a
- f... you to you?

42:55.083 --> 42:56.250
Oh, it was.

42:56.251 --> 42:57.416
Shut the f... up.

42:57.417 --> 42:58.726
- You're a mentally ill woman.
- Shut the f... up.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.601
- Shut the f... up.
- You told MJ about a video.

43:00.625 --> 43:02.021
Do you know what it does

43:02.022 --> 43:03.416
to my credibility?

43:03.417 --> 43:04.917
What the f...?

43:04.918 --> 43:06.416
Wait, please.

43:06.417 --> 43:07.480
I wanna walk away,

43:07.481 --> 43:08.542
just because I'm crying.

43:08.583 --> 43:09.667
Have a conscience.

43:09.668 --> 43:10.749
You're a bitch.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.542
Oh, so are you, sweetheart.

43:12.583 --> 43:14.167
For more "Shahs of Sunset,"
