WEBVTT

00:06.261 --> 00:07.679
This is the Big Man's turf.

00:07.888 --> 00:10.849
It was Silvermane's first,
and he's taking it back.

00:11.058 --> 00:13.560
<i>I just wanted flowers for my date
with Liz tonight.</i>

00:13.769 --> 00:16.312
<i>It's like the bad guys know
when I'm in a hurry.</i>

00:19.816 --> 00:22.444
<i>City's a powder keg
with Tombstone, Silvermane...</i>

00:22.653 --> 00:25.322
...and <i>even Doc Ock,
each vying to turn New York...</i>

00:25.531 --> 00:28.200
<i>...into his own personal
criminal empire.</i>

00:29.159 --> 00:33.539
<i>Liz's flowers.
Maybe Tombie would write me a note.</i>

01:45.611 --> 01:48.572
- Hey, Harr.
- Whoa, Pete, ninja much?

01:48.780 --> 01:50.907
Sorry. Where's Gwen?

01:51.325 --> 01:53.994
M.J. insisted on bringing her.

01:57.331 --> 02:01.752
Gentlemen, may I present,
Gwen Stacy.

02:08.758 --> 02:10.301
Hi.

02:10.844 --> 02:12.971
Wow, babe, you look great.

02:14.389 --> 02:17.809
Gwen, you look like an angel.

02:18.018 --> 02:21.355
Thanks, Peter. That was sweet.

02:40.415 --> 02:43.126
Michael, don't run.

02:43.752 --> 02:48.256
But, Joan, honeybunch, darling, it's not
too late to catch the Knicks. Why--?

02:48.465 --> 02:52.094
Because it's Valentine's Day
and you're giving me romantic or else.

02:52.886 --> 02:55.263
What's so romantic
about yodelling yokels?

02:55.472 --> 02:57.516
- What's that, dear?
- Nothing, sweetums.

03:05.399 --> 03:07.192
Dr. Octopus, I presume.

03:07.526 --> 03:08.777
Indeed.

03:08.985 --> 03:11.113
But where is our third party?

03:11.321 --> 03:14.032
Silvio Manfredi has arrived.

03:26.086 --> 03:27.379
We can begin.

03:29.506 --> 03:32.217
See, boss, it's good you brung me.

03:32.426 --> 03:34.302
You need me watching your back.

03:34.511 --> 03:39.641
Just don't give me or my back
cause to regret your inclusion.

03:43.603 --> 03:47.399
To the Valentine's Day Massa--
Summit.

03:57.451 --> 04:00.412
Wow, everything looks great.

04:03.081 --> 04:05.792
And it's free.
Helps to be the owner's daughter.

04:06.001 --> 04:08.295
Wow, what a surprise.

04:08.754 --> 04:11.256
Romantic minds think alike, eh?

04:11.465 --> 04:13.633
Why don't all us homeys sit together?

04:13.842 --> 04:16.678
You expect us to sit with them?
I don't think--

04:16.887 --> 04:18.805
Please, Sal. Stay.

04:19.723 --> 04:21.808
Fine. Scoot over.

04:22.309 --> 04:23.685
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

04:23.894 --> 04:26.313
- Don't touch me.
- Come on, stop complaining.

04:32.194 --> 04:35.405
- Patch, what are you--?
- I needed the scratch.

04:36.114 --> 04:37.365
Fine.

04:37.574 --> 04:39.701
But stay inconspicuous.

04:39.910 --> 04:40.994
Sure, sure.

04:41.203 --> 04:44.039
Sir, someone left this for you.

04:52.255 --> 04:53.423
Clumsy me.

04:53.632 --> 04:57.385
Yo, Parker,
help me pick this up, amigo.

04:57.594 --> 04:59.221
Okay, Parker, here's the deal.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.891
Make sure I don't say nothing
to make Sha Shan think I'm stupid.

05:03.099 --> 05:04.935
Dude. Ship. Sailed.

05:05.143 --> 05:07.896
Shut up! She likes smartness.

05:08.104 --> 05:10.816
That and, like, integrity and stuff.

05:11.024 --> 05:14.528
So if I say something dumb,
you kick me or something.

05:14.736 --> 05:16.863
For you, pal, anytime.

05:18.406 --> 05:23.411
- Weren't you picking up the silverware?
- Why? Wanna eat off dirty forks or--?

05:30.710 --> 05:34.005
Look, Big Man, here's the bottom line:

05:34.214 --> 05:37.425
The Manfredi family's ruled New York
for decades.

05:37.634 --> 05:40.595
You are not taking what is mine.

05:40.804 --> 05:44.224
You old-school types
always make things personal.

05:44.432 --> 05:47.310
But a criminal empire
should be run like a business.

05:48.562 --> 05:52.232
Not a business, a science.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.568
You both think so small...

05:54.776 --> 05:57.487
...fighting over scraps like rats.

05:57.863 --> 06:00.073
Given such confidence, doctor...

06:00.282 --> 06:02.826
...I wonder why you bothered
calling this summit.

06:03.034 --> 06:05.745
I didn't Call it.

06:05.954 --> 06:07.455
This relic did.

06:07.664 --> 06:09.082
What's the game here?

06:09.291 --> 06:12.002
You called the summit yourself,
Tombstone.

06:12.377 --> 06:14.754
Bet we could settle this easy.

06:14.963 --> 06:18.008
Oh, yeah? How would that go?

06:31.104 --> 06:32.898
Sable!

06:39.446 --> 06:41.865
Treachery!

06:42.073 --> 06:44.034
Your plan worked, boss. Take them.

06:44.242 --> 06:45.452
What?

06:55.837 --> 06:58.089
Will you stop squirming?

06:58.298 --> 07:00.258
It's this furshlugginer seat.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.010
It's built for hamsters.

07:02.218 --> 07:04.054
Zip it! People are trying to hear!

07:10.352 --> 07:12.729
You and I will have words.

07:45.303 --> 07:47.931
Now we make this personal.

07:48.431 --> 07:51.643
All goes well, them three mooks
take each other out...

07:51.851 --> 07:55.105
...and Hammerhead's the new
Big Man.

07:56.648 --> 07:59.234
Wonder who I got to thank
for them posies.

08:00.568 --> 08:02.153
Come on, come on.

08:02.362 --> 08:03.780
Hello? Robbie.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.909
Yo, Osborn.

08:08.118 --> 08:10.620
Nice remodel on Gwe--

08:11.538 --> 08:15.041
So you two enjoying your un-date?

08:15.417 --> 08:16.960
- Undoubtedly.
- Undoubtedly.

08:18.795 --> 08:21.256
Hello? Robbie?

08:21.464 --> 08:23.675
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm on a--

08:23.883 --> 08:25.135
Wait, who's fighting?

08:25.343 --> 08:26.761
Right. On my Way-

08:26.970 --> 08:29.222
Petey, it's Valentine's Day.

08:29.431 --> 08:31.891
Doesn't the <i>Bugle</i>
have any other photographers?

08:32.100 --> 08:35.145
- Not for this assignment.
- Parker, what are you doing?

08:35.352 --> 08:37.230
Sorry, Flash, you're on your own.

08:37.438 --> 08:39.982
Liz, I'll try to come back soon.

08:41.443 --> 08:43.528
Sorry, Gwen.

08:52.287 --> 08:53.496
- What's that?
- Shush.

08:53.705 --> 08:55.707
Oh, sorry, sorry, picklepuss.

08:55.915 --> 08:59.377
I gotta investigate. Could be news.

09:04.215 --> 09:06.551
We were all betrayed,
by Hammerhead.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.553
Hammerhead is a stooge.

09:08.762 --> 09:10.722
He doesn't blink without orders.

09:10.930 --> 09:14.517
Indeed, your denial lacks sincerity.

09:30.784 --> 09:32.786
I thought I was just making an excuse.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.927
Et tu, Octopus?

09:50.011 --> 09:51.304
What can I say?

09:51.513 --> 09:55.058
An opportunity is an opportunity,
Silvermane.

09:55.266 --> 09:57.560
Oh, so that's Silvermane.

09:57.769 --> 10:00.855
Wow, three-way battle
to declare New York's biggest jerk.

10:01.064 --> 10:02.190
Where do I start?

10:02.398 --> 10:05.693
Perhaps with your demise, arachnid.

10:23.002 --> 10:26.214
Hey, picklepuss,
this is heavier than it looks, so--

10:27.340 --> 10:30.552
Move, kids. Can't trust
that blasted web-head to save us.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.095
Oh, real nice.

10:41.479 --> 10:43.606
Oh, man.

10:58.413 --> 10:59.497
Cordon off the area.

10:59.706 --> 11:01.749
Priority one is protecting civilians.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.543
Call me a relic.

11:06.754 --> 11:09.799
- Call Blackie Gaxton.
- Gaxton.

11:11.426 --> 11:14.596
Hey, Blackie.

11:17.473 --> 11:18.641
I just don't get Pete.

11:18.850 --> 11:21.895
What kind of guy abandons his girl
on Valentine's?

11:22.103 --> 11:26.232
That's not fair, Harry. You know
he needs the <i>Bugle</i> to help his aunt.

11:29.611 --> 11:31.529
How are your snails?

11:31.738 --> 11:36.784
When you told me to try the escargot,
I thought you'd esoar-went, but--

11:36.993 --> 11:38.161
What was that for?

11:38.369 --> 11:42.040
I don't know, but Parker was doing it.
It looked like fun.

11:42.665 --> 11:46.002
- A romantic rose for your lady?
<i>- I'll</i> take your whole basket.

11:49.339 --> 11:52.050
- Thank you.
- Now, he knows how to treat a lady.

12:08.191 --> 12:09.901
So this is the Spider-Man...

12:10.109 --> 12:12.946
...that's given Tombstone and Octopus
so much trouble.

12:13.154 --> 12:15.657
As yet, I'm unimpressed.

12:15.865 --> 12:19.369
You haven't seen me juggle bowling
balls while drinking a glass of water.

12:19.577 --> 12:22.330
<i>I've gotta start making that stuff
stronger.</i>

12:29.003 --> 12:33.258
Octopus calling Kraven. Do you read?

12:45.603 --> 12:49.190
They are so not making old folks
like they used to.

12:49.691 --> 12:52.485
Excellent, May. You're fit as a fiddle.

12:52.694 --> 12:54.654
That's what I keep telling Peter.

12:54.862 --> 12:58.533
It's sweet of you to make this
house call so I can give him the word.

12:58.741 --> 12:59.909
Oh, my pleasure.

13:00.118 --> 13:03.788
But, you know, I'm surprised
you're home alone on Valentine's Day.

13:03.997 --> 13:06.791
Oh, well, what would I be doing?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.043
<i>And Peter's hanging with his friends.</i>

13:09.252 --> 13:13.965
You will pay the price for your
constant interference, arachnid.

13:14.173 --> 13:17.302
I'm broke. How about you pay tonight
and I'll owe you one?

13:20.346 --> 13:23.641
My enemies and this Jurassic jerk
are taking each other out.

13:23.850 --> 13:25.727
And I'm trying to stop them, why?

13:29.355 --> 13:31.399
Oh, right. Public safety.

13:36.237 --> 13:37.739
Robbie? Robbie?

13:37.947 --> 13:40.199
Confounded static. Robbie!

13:42.410 --> 13:45.371
This is the cause of our troubles.

13:45.580 --> 13:49.792
We can rule Manhattan together
or divide it at our leisure...

13:50.001 --> 13:53.796
...as soon as we dispose of this pest.

13:55.006 --> 13:57.175
Please tell me the fat lady's
not singing.

14:05.600 --> 14:10.063
Hold him still,
and I'll finish what the both of you--

14:10.271 --> 14:11.731
Stop, fool.

14:11.939 --> 14:13.900
Let go.

14:14.108 --> 14:16.444
Thanks, Tombie.
Just don't expect roses.

14:16.652 --> 14:19.447
Best field trip ever.

14:19.655 --> 14:21.741
Sorry, doctor. Too many witnesses.

14:21.949 --> 14:25.703
L. Thompson Lincoln can't be seen
collaborating with super-villains.

14:25.912 --> 14:29.248
Then I. Thompson Lincoln is weak.

14:31.459 --> 14:32.752
You're all weak.

14:33.211 --> 14:36.047
I'm confused.
Did you wanna fight or dance?

14:42.178 --> 14:44.764
If your knee's bothering you,
we can just talk.

14:44.972 --> 14:47.475
No, we'll dance. We'll dance.

14:47.683 --> 14:51.896
Flash, stop. You don't have to be afraid
to open your mouth around me.

14:52.105 --> 14:53.815
I like you for who you are:

14:54.023 --> 14:57.235
An honest guy
who stands up for what's right.

14:58.361 --> 14:59.987
Then dance with me.

15:00.196 --> 15:03.908
Because honestly,
I can't think of anything I'd rather do.

15:06.536 --> 15:08.413
Come on, sis, dance with us.

15:08.621 --> 15:11.499
And be a third wheel on the most
romantic night of the year?

15:11.707 --> 15:13.584
Romantic? Please.

15:13.793 --> 15:17.672
It's a commercial holiday created by
florists and greeting card companies.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.507
Nothing romantic about it.

15:19.715 --> 15:21.843
Yes. Yes, I will.

15:24.887 --> 15:28.558
Okay, maybe a little romantic.

15:31.185 --> 15:32.478
Can%see.

15:32.687 --> 15:35.815
But I don't need my sight to finish this.

15:36.023 --> 15:38.067
<i>Oh, great. A hood with focus.</i>

15:39.819 --> 15:42.780
<i>That sound. Hydraulic servos
are powering this armour.</i>

15:43.531 --> 15:46.909
<i>No hydraulics, no power.</i>

15:53.666 --> 15:55.334
No. No.

15:55.543 --> 15:59.172
This cannot happen to Silvio Manfredi.

15:59.380 --> 16:02.175
Sable, Sable, do you read me?

16:02.383 --> 16:05.678
Sable to Silvermane.
Daddy, do you copy?

16:11.642 --> 16:14.103
Spill, hamster.
How have you blocked our comm?

16:14.312 --> 16:16.147
Blocked your comm?

16:16.355 --> 16:18.524
Well, wouldn't you like to know?

16:19.484 --> 16:21.360
Don't you turn your back on me.

16:21.569 --> 16:25.323
- My father--
- Daddy's out of the picture, princess.

16:25.740 --> 16:27.575
So be nice.

16:32.246 --> 16:33.789
I know it's not sporting...

16:33.998 --> 16:37.710
...but who am I to balk
at playing the scavenger?

16:37.919 --> 16:40.713
The law of the jungle prevails.

16:43.508 --> 16:44.759
Newsflash, doc.

16:44.967 --> 16:46.761
Not a lot of octopi in the jungle.

16:47.345 --> 16:49.430
Don't go anywhere.

17:39.855 --> 17:42.191
No witnesses down here.

17:47.488 --> 17:51.033
I assume you remember
our last physical encounter.

17:51.242 --> 17:52.368
Painfully.

17:52.577 --> 17:55.204
But I told you then,
I don't look the other way.

19:09.487 --> 19:12.573
Captain George Stacy,
meet I. Thompson Lincoln...

19:12.782 --> 19:14.325
...alias Tombstone...

19:14.533 --> 19:16.410
...alias the Big Man of crime.

19:16.619 --> 19:18.704
Mr. Lincoln, you're under arrest.

19:18.913 --> 19:19.997
Confound it, Stacy.

19:20.206 --> 19:24.085
I'll give you six seconds to arrest
Spider-Man for assaulting this citizen.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.505
Everyone saw Lincoln save
that ungrateful web-head's life.

19:27.713 --> 19:29.924
Boss. J.J.

19:30.132 --> 19:31.926
What? What?

19:32.927 --> 19:36.055
Never mind.

19:36.263 --> 19:38.933
Jonah Jameson, you abandoned me.

19:39.141 --> 19:45.231
Joan, if I'm not elsewhere
in 0.2 seconds, I'm stroking out!

19:46.232 --> 19:47.400
You're fired.

19:47.608 --> 19:50.152
Expect your severance package soon.

19:56.992 --> 19:58.035
Thanks.

19:58.244 --> 20:01.288
This can't be what you had planned
for Valentine's Day.

20:01.747 --> 20:04.333
Valentine's Day.

20:06.252 --> 20:08.713
- You're not seeing her.
- Look, Mark.

20:08.921 --> 20:11.340
I didn't wanna go, but I need that job.

20:11.549 --> 20:14.343
You think this is about your job?
Liz gets the job.

20:14.552 --> 20:18.097
- Then what--?
- Two words: Gwen Stacy.

20:18.305 --> 20:22.101
Liz saw how you looked at her,
how you apologised to her for leaving.

20:22.309 --> 20:25.980
My sister's not gonna be your
second choice. She's too good for that.

20:26.188 --> 20:28.315
She's too good for you.

20:32.069 --> 20:33.279
Something wrong, son?

20:33.487 --> 20:34.655
Did you see the paper?

20:36.115 --> 20:37.742
Tombstone made bail.

20:37.950 --> 20:41.495
Lincoln may be free,
but the world knows he's the Big Man.

20:41.704 --> 20:44.874
Sixteen government agencies
now have him under surveillance.

20:45.082 --> 20:47.168
His operation is crippled.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.086
We'll get him eventually.

20:50.379 --> 20:51.756
Well, good.

20:51.964 --> 20:54.091
Here's the real problem:

20:54.300 --> 20:57.928
You've created a power vacuum
in the criminal universe.

20:58.137 --> 21:00.431
And nature abhors a vacuum.

21:06.103 --> 21:09.064
Hammerhead never showed
this kind of initiative.

21:09.273 --> 21:11.859
I should have known
you were behind this.

21:12.067 --> 21:14.487
Guilty, gum)'-

21:14.695 --> 21:18.282
And, oh, so very guilty...

21:18.491 --> 21:23.370
...of being the new Big Man of crime.
