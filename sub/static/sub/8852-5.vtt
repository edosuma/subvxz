WEBVTT

00:05.094 --> 00:07.680
Wake up, you old piece of shit!

00:07.747 --> 00:09.281
- Slappy birthday!
- Happy Birthday.

00:09.349 --> 00:11.083
Guys, guys, come on, please.

00:11.151 --> 00:12.846
Not this year, guys.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.181
I don't want to do it
this year.

00:15.785 --> 00:17.256
All right, all right.

00:17.324 --> 00:19.269
Fine, I'll do it,
but only because

00:19.435 --> 00:20.226
I'm already dressed, guys!

00:20.293 --> 00:21.427
Oh!

00:21.495 --> 00:22.272
Bam.

00:22.438 --> 00:26.985
Are you ready
for the birthday booze-athon?

00:27.151 --> 00:28.534
Walking, walking,
walking, walking.

00:28.602 --> 00:30.155
Well, it's your birthday,
slappy birthday.

00:30.321 --> 00:33.072
He's looking good,
but you gotta wonder if his age

00:33.140 --> 00:35.574
is gonna be a factor
in this year's tour de franzia.

00:35.642 --> 00:36.809
I've got you by the back.

00:36.877 --> 00:38.043
I got you by the back.

00:38.111 --> 00:41.514
You can do it.
We all believe in you.

00:41.581 --> 00:43.085
Very good.

00:43.316 --> 00:44.450
Oh, he lost helmet.

00:44.518 --> 00:45.784
He missed the flamingo.

00:45.852 --> 00:46.785
Oh, guys.

00:46.853 --> 00:48.220
Yeah.

00:48.288 --> 00:49.588
What is it?
That's not beer.

00:49.656 --> 00:50.589
No, it's whiskey.

00:50.657 --> 00:52.024
I watered it down though.

00:52.092 --> 00:52.886
Okay.
All right, fine.

00:53.052 --> 00:54.126
With beer.
Here we go.

00:54.194 --> 00:55.127
Come on.

00:55.195 --> 00:56.390
Oh!

00:56.556 --> 01:01.700
Booze-athon, yeah.

01:01.768 --> 01:03.135
Come on, derzel Hasselhoff,

01:03.203 --> 01:04.690
baywatch those beers,
you're doing great.

01:04.855 --> 01:05.871
No, dude.
I can't do it,

01:05.939 --> 01:07.706
I'm starting to get hot mouth.

01:07.774 --> 01:09.241
Come on, they need your help.

01:09.309 --> 01:10.509
Clock's ticking by, let's go.

01:10.577 --> 01:11.446
No, no.

01:12.579 --> 01:15.114
Yeah.

01:15.182 --> 01:16.282
Get 'em.

01:16.349 --> 01:17.883
Eww.

01:17.951 --> 01:19.051
Oh, my gosh.

01:19.119 --> 01:22.321
Nobody's puked the pool
in like, a while.

01:22.389 --> 01:23.355
It's been a while.

01:23.423 --> 01:24.757
It's been too long, actually.

01:24.824 --> 01:25.858
I guess we did it.

01:25.926 --> 01:29.795
Yeah, it's been a while.

01:29.863 --> 01:32.965
I'm done.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.433
Well, you're paying
for a pool cleaner.

01:34.501 --> 01:37.203
I mean, don't be
a dick about it.

01:37.270 --> 01:40.058
That is an entire bagel bite.

01:40.224 --> 01:41.207
He ate your bagel bite.

01:41.274 --> 01:42.185
He ate my bagel bites.

Son of a bitch!
Dammit!

02:01.094 --> 02:03.129
Where are you going?

02:03.196 --> 02:05.531
Well, this is Ders'
birthday breakfast.

02:05.599 --> 02:09.033
I got him some grapefruit,
a grandpa bran muffin,

02:09.102 --> 02:10.672
and a shot of prune juice
and Jagermeister.

02:10.838 --> 02:11.737
'Cause you saw him
yesterday, man.

02:11.805 --> 02:13.239
He's an old dude.

02:13.306 --> 02:15.107
Man, he's crazy old.
It's bizarre how old he is.

02:15.175 --> 02:16.242
It's not carrot cake.

02:16.309 --> 02:18.177
- Hmm, yuck.
- No, no.

02:18.245 --> 02:19.178
Nah, it's no good.

02:19.246 --> 02:20.179
Yeah, it's for old men.

02:20.247 --> 02:21.313
Yeah, Ders is old,

02:21.381 --> 02:22.314
he's like a year
and a half older.

02:22.382 --> 02:23.315
You know
how many months that is?

02:23.383 --> 02:25.151
That's like--

02:25.218 --> 02:27.052
Anyways, don't mention
anything about him getting old

02:27.120 --> 02:28.154
'cause, you know,
it's his birthday.

02:28.221 --> 02:29.255
Just play cool.

02:29.322 --> 02:30.456
I should help
you carry the tray though

02:30.524 --> 02:31.457
because that looks...

02:31.525 --> 02:32.458
- No.
- ...Heavy

02:32.526 --> 02:33.459
and I'm--

02:33.527 --> 02:34.821
definitely have a solid core.

02:34.987 --> 02:36.328
Okay.
I see what you're doing,

02:36.396 --> 02:37.463
you're trying to say it's from
both of us. It's not.

02:37.531 --> 02:39.298
This is sort of
from both of us though,

02:39.366 --> 02:40.299
because...

02:40.367 --> 02:41.867
My mom gave us this tray

02:41.935 --> 02:43.169
when my grandma died.

02:43.236 --> 02:48.574
Well, uh, tell your
dead grandma I said thanks.

02:48.642 --> 02:50.476
Well, look who's up.

02:50.544 --> 02:51.477
Whoa, beef castle.

02:51.545 --> 02:52.978
Oh, what's up with you guys?

02:53.046 --> 02:54.046
- Who's swagging?
- No, I'm swagging.

02:54.114 --> 02:55.047
You swagging?

02:55.115 --> 02:56.415
- I--I think maybe.
- Yeah.

02:56.483 --> 02:57.550
Come on, man.

02:57.617 --> 03:00.052
What are you listening to?

03:00.120 --> 03:01.754
Oh, dudf,
it's this new mash-up tape,

03:01.821 --> 03:04.323
dj Chris unchained!

03:04.391 --> 03:05.591
Lah dow.

03:05.659 --> 03:06.759
Marry lah dow--let me--

03:06.826 --> 03:07.760
- uh-hmm.
- Let me listen.

03:07.827 --> 03:08.861
Yeah.

03:08.929 --> 03:10.629
Like jamiroquai,
mix of smash mouth.

03:10.697 --> 03:11.664
I hear it now.

03:11.731 --> 03:12.765
Nope!
That's a chop, buddy.

03:12.832 --> 03:14.867
Ow. What--what was that?
That was weird.

03:14.935 --> 03:15.904
Why are you chopping him?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.236
It's a chop, man,

03:17.304 --> 03:18.704
you say or do anything stupid
and that's a chop.

03:18.772 --> 03:19.905
We used to do it
on the playground

03:19.973 --> 03:21.840
when I was a kid,
so I'm bringing it back.

03:21.908 --> 03:22.975
- Okay.
- Yeah, that's cool.

03:23.043 --> 03:25.044
Thank you for that
and thank me for this.

03:25.111 --> 03:27.413
It's a breakfast
for your birthday

03:27.480 --> 03:29.848
and, oh.
I got you this gift.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.169
And you know what?
Happy Birthday.

03:31.335 --> 03:33.552
Well, it's--it's just from me,
not Adam.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.454
It came on my tray, so.

03:35.522 --> 03:36.689
It's a golf polo.

03:36.756 --> 03:37.823
Very American dadiator.

03:37.891 --> 03:39.225
You could get married
in something like that;

03:39.292 --> 03:40.893
You could probably also get
divorced in that as well.

03:40.961 --> 03:44.296
Or a job interview or maybe
like a soldier's funeral,

03:44.364 --> 03:45.698
or I was thinking,
hey, you know,

03:45.765 --> 03:48.367
you want to be
city councilman dude, one day.

03:48.435 --> 03:49.868
So, maybe you can wear that
and get elected.

03:49.936 --> 03:52.838
It's not really what the young
go-hards are wearing right now,

03:52.906 --> 03:54.440
you know,
the go-hards are wearing--

03:54.507 --> 03:56.486
I can't wear this if I'm gonna
run with the go-hards.

03:56.652 --> 03:57.776
Very swag.

03:57.844 --> 03:58.844
Maybe I'll--I'll just--

03:58.912 --> 04:00.379
oh, yeah.
There we go.

04:00.447 --> 04:01.992
- Get this bad boy there.
- Cool, yeah.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.315
That's much better.
That is much better.

04:03.383 --> 04:05.284
You're very strong by the way.

04:05.352 --> 04:06.318
- Looks great, yeah.
- Yes.

04:06.386 --> 04:07.330
That was $60.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.754
City councilman dude?

04:08.822 --> 04:09.888
How about I try and be like

04:09.956 --> 04:11.290

04:21.601 --> 04:23.235
You got next.

04:23.303 --> 04:25.738
That was fun.
That was my first taxi ride.

04:25.805 --> 04:27.006
There you go, thank you.

04:27.073 --> 04:28.741
- It went pretty fast.
- Thanks a lot.

04:28.808 --> 04:30.145
Dude, what are we doing here?

04:30.311 --> 04:32.144
We should be wut drinking more.

04:32.212 --> 04:33.812
We should be out drinking more.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.847
- Yes.
- We're not gonna do that.

04:34.914 --> 04:37.116
Are we still gonna do that?

04:39.653 --> 04:41.720
Whoa.

04:41.788 --> 04:42.908
Look at this.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.490
Dude, this is swagged out.

04:44.557 --> 04:45.824
Very swagged out.

04:45.892 --> 04:47.626
Hey, hey, hey you all

04:47.694 --> 04:49.695
This is captain America times
stoked right here.

04:49.763 --> 04:52.417
I won this at the mall,
I guessed its weight.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.567
Yo, dude, it's my birthday
right now today.

04:55.635 --> 04:59.204
Let me take this thing out
for a smob.

04:59.272 --> 05:01.006
You out your mind?

05:01.074 --> 05:03.208
Colleen don't even get
to ride in this,

05:03.276 --> 05:05.844
unless she's doing maintenance
from the passenger seat.

05:05.912 --> 05:07.880
And you all know I'm talking
about road-head.

05:07.947 --> 05:09.682
Surprisingly, I did know that.

05:09.749 --> 05:11.061
It's licky, licky time.

05:11.227 --> 05:12.451
I don't care what you guys say,

05:12.519 --> 05:14.753
Harry and the Hendersons
is legit.

05:14.821 --> 05:16.121
No, we said it was legit.

05:16.189 --> 05:18.190
Whoa, yeah, here's my birthday
present that I got you.

05:18.258 --> 05:19.358
Oh, dude.

05:19.426 --> 05:20.237
I put it in a box.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.360
Thanks so much,

05:21.428 --> 05:22.394
except you're lying.

05:22.462 --> 05:23.495
I had this next-dayed
last night.

05:23.563 --> 05:27.032
Oh, that's a chop.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.411
Who wants to do a snippet?

05:28.635 --> 05:29.935
I love snippets.

05:30.003 --> 05:31.370
Uh, actually, we--

05:31.438 --> 05:32.738
With the whippets, right?

05:32.806 --> 05:34.873
Yeah, it's a whippet.
People comes to snip its snout.

05:34.941 --> 05:37.009
What if we just, uh, ducked
out into the bathroom

05:37.077 --> 05:38.510
and got drunk like usual?

05:38.578 --> 05:39.511
That'll be fun.

05:39.579 --> 05:41.146
No, we are making memories

05:41.214 --> 05:44.616
and then destroying them.

05:44.684 --> 05:46.452
Okay, no.
That is hippy-crack, man.

05:46.519 --> 05:48.932
Did we not all cry during
that Steve-O documentary?

05:49.155 --> 05:52.758
Relax your mind,
I'm gonna blast off.

05:52.826 --> 05:54.493
Oh, wow!

05:54.561 --> 05:56.628
We're just celebrating
big Ders' dog birthday.

05:56.696 --> 05:57.629
Yeah.

05:57.697 --> 05:58.864
Because the Ders' a dog

05:58.932 --> 05:59.865
and then there is everything

05:59.933 --> 06:02.401
that's happens to--

06:02.469 --> 06:03.402
Sorry?

06:03.470 --> 06:04.570
Nothing.

06:04.637 --> 06:05.571
Yeah, he's monkeying
around again.

06:05.638 --> 06:07.005
Whatever.

06:07.073 --> 06:09.608
Look, uh, there's a big surprise
for you in the break room.

06:09.676 --> 06:11.543
It--it's a birthday cake.

06:11.611 --> 06:12.911
Anyway, I'm not going.

06:12.979 --> 06:13.979
Okay.

06:14.047 --> 06:15.614
Anders, we have a dress code,

06:15.682 --> 06:18.083
can you please?

06:18.151 --> 06:22.788
It's Craig Norman, bitch.

06:22.856 --> 06:24.656
Surprise!

06:24.724 --> 06:26.291
Yeah.

06:26.359 --> 06:27.345
There he is!

06:27.511 --> 06:29.264
How does it feel to be 25?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.230
You get nothing.

06:31.297 --> 06:34.867
Ders, the secret
to staying young is...

06:34.934 --> 06:40.650
Laugh a lot.

06:40.874 --> 06:42.508
And...

06:42.575 --> 06:44.943
Moisturize,

06:45.011 --> 06:46.345
that's right.

06:46.413 --> 06:48.847
You know, Anders, you're the
same age my parents were

06:48.915 --> 06:49.848
when they had me.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.116
And then they gave me away

06:51.184 --> 06:54.019
and then I was adopted
by those horrible Koreans.

06:54.087 --> 06:55.387
Oh, well.

07:02.695 --> 07:04.596
Der, you always doubt.

07:04.664 --> 07:06.231
That.

07:10.703 --> 07:12.271
Laugh a lot.

07:13.773 --> 07:14.840
All right, okay.

07:14.908 --> 07:15.894
Just--

07:16.060 --> 07:17.342
Oh.

07:17.410 --> 07:21.713
I know how old I am!

07:21.781 --> 07:22.848
Sorry.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.783
He's on a ton
of drugs right now.

07:24.851 --> 07:26.452
He's like drugged
out of his mind.

07:26.519 --> 07:27.920
Thank you.

07:27.987 --> 07:29.354
No, waymond, no, no!

07:29.422 --> 07:32.624
No! Bad waymond, bad!

07:32.692 --> 07:36.895
- Ders.
- Ders.

07:36.963 --> 07:39.498
Gosh, what the heck is wrong
with that guy?

07:39.566 --> 07:41.500
Whatever, we just gotta party
through those demons.

07:41.568 --> 07:43.101
No, that's the last thing
we need to do.

07:43.169 --> 07:44.236
We need to slow down.

07:44.304 --> 07:45.737
Otherwise he's gonna
turn into...

07:45.805 --> 07:47.372
"The Ders."

07:47.440 --> 07:48.574
That would be awesome.

07:48.641 --> 07:49.575
I love "the Ders,"

07:49.642 --> 07:50.642
and you love "the Ders."

07:50.710 --> 07:51.643
Last time we partied
with "the Ders,"

07:51.711 --> 07:53.145
we went to seven Mary three.

07:53.213 --> 07:54.279
Got us backstage.

07:54.347 --> 07:56.181
He head butted
a female security guard,

07:56.249 --> 07:57.182
bum-rushed the stage,

07:57.250 --> 07:59.437
and dedicated a song to his dad.

07:59.603 --> 08:00.552
Yeah,

08:00.620 --> 08:02.855
but that song was <i>cumbersome.</i>

08:02.922 --> 08:04.490
And it meant a lot to all of us
at the time.

08:04.557 --> 08:05.724
Did it, though?

08:05.792 --> 08:07.826
That's my favorite dersion
of vers.

08:08.895 --> 08:12.498
Whoa.

08:12.565 --> 08:15.703
All aboard
to downtown pound town.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.370
♪ Too heavy, too light,
too black or too white ♪

08:25.437 --> 08:29.641
♪ too wrong or too right,
today or tonight ♪

08:29.708 --> 08:33.678
♪ cumbersome ♪

08:33.746 --> 08:35.113
Oh, we are so American.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.315
This is the most American thing
we could do right now.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.850
- Whoo!
- I feel like I'm in a parade.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.152
How cool of montez
to let you borrow his new car.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.821
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Borrow that dude's car?

08:42.888 --> 08:44.923
Dude, I took the keys right off
that fool's desk.

08:44.990 --> 08:45.990
Whoa.

08:46.058 --> 08:48.426
- Uh-huh.
- Holy grand theft auto.

08:48.494 --> 08:49.427
We're badass.

08:49.495 --> 08:50.528
That's American.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.830
- Stealing cars is American.
- Thank you.

08:51.897 --> 08:53.331
Where are we going?

08:53.399 --> 08:54.866
Dude, we're going straight
to pound town.

08:54.934 --> 08:55.967
Yeah, baby.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.136
Population three,
cheap import beer,

08:58.204 --> 09:00.305
cheap export swag.

09:00.372 --> 09:01.306
Ah, okay.

09:01.373 --> 09:02.373
Exported swag, I like it.

09:02.441 --> 09:03.441
And I know it's your birthday,

09:03.509 --> 09:04.576
I don't want to be
a wet serape,

09:04.643 --> 09:07.088
but maybe we should go home
to chill ville.

09:07.254 --> 09:08.613
It's pretty cool.
Plus Adam,

09:08.681 --> 09:10.915
nobody serves beer at 10:30,
so help me out.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.852
Yeah, a little place
called dolphin's strip club.

09:13.919 --> 09:16.087
Most definitely booze.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.057
Um, they're not open yet.
Damn it.

09:18.223 --> 09:19.490
No, it's fine that it's closed

09:19.558 --> 09:22.560
because home has
tons of pornography.

09:22.628 --> 09:23.661
I know that's a fact.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.731
And the kitchen serves beer
all day.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.030
It's gonna be fun.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.131
We could just go drink
at a parking lot somewhere.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.466
Yeah.

09:28.534 --> 09:29.652
That's a chop, even for
suggesting going home.

09:29.818 --> 09:30.668
- I know.
- Consider yourself chopped.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.669
It's a chop back.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.670
No, ten for contact.

09:32.738 --> 09:33.771
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10.

09:33.839 --> 09:34.906
Is that real?
Is that part of the game?

09:34.974 --> 09:36.140
I've never heard that,
but I like that.

09:36.208 --> 09:39.878
♪ You wanna get real,
whoo, then act real ♪

09:39.945 --> 09:41.145

09:46.252 --> 09:47.552
Wow, very good.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.188
All right.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.556
This place is awesome, man,

09:51.624 --> 09:53.391
where did you--where did you
find out about this spot?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.461
Dude, my dad took me here
for my 11th birthday.

09:56.528 --> 09:59.430
He got weird drunk and
he showed up, most importantly.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.666
That was the first time I got
arrested, at 11.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.534
This is really fun, guys.
I'm having a great time.

10:03.602 --> 10:05.570
I didn't think I would say this
ever in my life,

10:05.638 --> 10:08.072
but maybe we should get
back to work, yeah?

10:08.140 --> 10:10.074
Return a stolen car that's
in our possession?

10:10.142 --> 10:12.320
Boo, Nicky's joking.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.444
Is that a joke?

10:13.512 --> 10:14.612
I'm puking--I'm drinking it.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.614
Dude, we're shutting
this bitch down.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.217
- We're partying until 8 p! N!
- Yeah.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.320
Oh, yeah? You--you--yup,
that's a chop.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.521
You said p.N.

10:23.589 --> 10:24.989
It's official.

10:25.057 --> 10:29.394
Oh, well that's a chop back
because p.N. Is post noon,

10:29.461 --> 10:30.395
everyone knows that.

10:30.462 --> 10:31.396
You need to go back to school,

10:31.463 --> 10:32.630
pick up some knowledge.

10:32.698 --> 10:33.765
So, uh, Ders,

10:33.832 --> 10:35.500
what would it take
for you to consider

10:35.567 --> 10:38.870
maybe doing the exact opposite
of shutting bitches down?

10:38.938 --> 10:41.272
Maybe leaving this bitch,
heading towards home bitch,

10:41.340 --> 10:43.074
home sweet home bitch?

10:43.142 --> 10:44.075
You know what?

10:44.143 --> 10:45.643
See that shark blimp over there?

10:45.711 --> 10:49.080
You win me that,
and I'll go home right now.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.850
All right, well, then one
shark blimp chumming right up.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.052
Nice.

10:54.119 --> 10:57.755
Hey, good luck, buddy.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.390
Oh, yeah!

10:59.458 --> 11:00.658
Yeah, yeah.

11:07.266 --> 11:10.735
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

11:10.803 --> 11:12.904
How many more times
are you gonna play?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.639
Uh, I'm gonna play

11:14.707 --> 11:16.975
infinity more times,
little man. Okay?

11:17.042 --> 11:18.710
All right, Ders,
keep pounding that dog.

11:18.777 --> 11:20.311
- I gotta make a call, okay?
- Will do.

11:20.379 --> 11:22.046
Dolphins.
Hey, Marty, what's up?

11:22.114 --> 11:22.974
It's d-bone.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.949
You might remember me
as d-train.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.395
Mister, it's my birthday.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.054
Buddy, it's my birthday, too.
You're not special.

11:30.122 --> 11:31.823
Did someone tell you
that you were?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.324
'Cause you aren't.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.425
I'm gonna tell on you.

11:34.493 --> 11:35.693
You tell everybody
you wanna tell.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.861
Tell the whole world.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.664
I'm gonna tell on you.
Pbbbt!

11:48.340 --> 11:51.042
Ahhhh!

11:57.816 --> 11:59.594
- Hey, man.
- Ow! What?

11:59.818 --> 12:01.085
What you doing here, man?

12:01.153 --> 12:04.288
Kid's trying to play
and you game hogging?

12:04.356 --> 12:06.290
Since when is this
the only game?

12:06.358 --> 12:08.993
There's a million games.
They can play other games.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.662
You do realize that
this is a Dante's, right?

12:11.730 --> 12:15.333
I mean, it's basically
a black Chuck E. Cheese.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.603
Okay. I can see that.
I mean, that guy's not black.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.271
Oh, that's Oakland Tony.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.440
O.T.

12:22.508 --> 12:23.708
Oh, he blacker than I am.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.811
Buddy, I-I'm sorry.
Today is my birthday.

12:26.879 --> 12:28.646
I'm gonna wild out
and have a good time.

12:28.714 --> 12:29.957
I got a cup full of coins,

12:30.182 --> 12:32.316
and I'm gonna get wild
with them, all right?

12:32.384 --> 12:33.518
Sorry.

12:33.585 --> 12:34.504
Hey.

12:34.670 --> 12:38.790
I got my eyes on you.

12:38.857 --> 12:39.791
Legitimately scary.

12:39.858 --> 12:42.136
Too drunk to care.

12:42.302 --> 12:43.361
It's illegal for you to tell me

12:43.429 --> 12:46.030
I can't take this outside,
that's illegal.

12:46.098 --> 12:49.901
Oh, there they are.
My sweet, sweet princesses.

12:49.968 --> 12:52.403
Welcome to my castle,
can I take your coats?

12:52.471 --> 12:55.006
No, wow, mama.

12:55.074 --> 12:55.942
Oh, you better put those on,

12:56.108 --> 12:57.041
you're getting jealous.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.242
You're getting jealous, huh?

12:58.310 --> 13:00.278
Whose birthday?

13:00.345 --> 13:02.115
It's feels like my birthday.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.548
So it might as well be.

13:03.615 --> 13:06.984
Hitch a ride on the sex bus.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.152
Just kidding.
We can't have sex here.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.372
There's kids everywhere.

13:16.336 --> 13:17.637
Yeah, it's my birthday.

13:17.704 --> 13:19.172
I figured I'd treat myself
a little bit, you know.

13:19.239 --> 13:20.773
Keep shaking it, here we go.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.634
- Whoa.
- Oh.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.410
Dude, is that my gift?

13:24.478 --> 13:25.811
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

13:25.879 --> 13:27.780
Yeah, it is your--it is your
birthday present.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.015
Woo, hey.

13:29.082 --> 13:30.516
I just want to make sure
they are not poisonous.

13:32.219 --> 13:34.605
No, it's good unless
you're allergic to glitter, so--

13:34.771 --> 13:37.123
Whoa, glitter titties,
for real?

13:37.191 --> 13:38.491
I'll be right there.

13:38.559 --> 13:40.826
Come on, man.
Let's go.

13:40.894 --> 13:44.397
Sorry, man. You're 46 tickets
shy of the shark.

13:44.464 --> 13:47.600
You could get some vampire teeth
and some scrunchies.

13:47.668 --> 13:49.035
What?

13:49.102 --> 13:50.236
Okay, look.

13:50.304 --> 13:51.304
I'm not trying
to freak out on you, man.

13:51.371 --> 13:52.538
You're just doing your job.

13:52.606 --> 13:53.806
I've got a job, too.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.107
And I do it sometimes.

13:55.175 --> 13:56.976
But this is an emergency, okay?

13:57.044 --> 13:59.378
We've got a guy
who is five beers away

13:59.446 --> 14:01.714
from turning into the Ders.

14:01.782 --> 14:04.684
This is a guy who [Bleep]Ed
a coy fish in the mouth

14:04.751 --> 14:08.621
until it died
in front of a p.F. Chang's.

14:08.689 --> 14:10.389
I just count tickets, dude.

14:10.457 --> 14:11.991
Yeah, I'm your boss.

14:12.059 --> 14:14.694
Here we go.
Trying to buck you.

14:14.761 --> 14:16.195
Oh, she just made
her butthole wink.

14:16.263 --> 14:17.940
- What?
- It just winked at me.

14:18.106 --> 14:19.065
Oh, that is too real.

14:19.132 --> 14:20.166
Oh my God.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.167
Well, not a fan.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.436
Let's stick to hits, please.

14:23.503 --> 14:24.437
Cool.

14:24.504 --> 14:25.538
- Titties up.
- Angel,

14:25.606 --> 14:26.839
hold up buddy,
my knees are burning--

14:26.907 --> 14:30.042
what the hell!

14:30.110 --> 14:33.379
I need to see you outside now.

14:33.447 --> 14:35.541
Where they go?
Where they at?

14:39.219 --> 14:40.152
Oh, I'm going to miss you.

14:40.220 --> 14:41.621
I can't afford you for longer.

14:41.688 --> 14:42.622
But I'm going to miss you.

14:42.689 --> 14:43.789
Button up.

14:43.857 --> 14:45.024
Let's play it safe.
There's kids.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.792
There's kids.
You got to respect the kids.

14:46.860 --> 14:48.427
Someone took
a sip from my beer.

14:48.495 --> 14:50.496
I don't like that,
birthday boy.

14:50.564 --> 14:52.725
Angel, go play
with the team, okay?

14:52.891 --> 14:54.600
Later, dude, we changed
your life. Don't forget that.

14:54.668 --> 14:56.902
Yeah dude, you're going to
remember that forever.

14:56.970 --> 14:59.805
Now, I ain't trying
to fight today

14:59.873 --> 15:01.941
because it's
a beautiful occasion.

15:02.009 --> 15:06.739
But you brought strippers,
albeit some fine ass strippers,

15:06.905 --> 15:08.247
to a kid's pizza place.

15:08.315 --> 15:12.084
Dude, I'm not going
to say this again.

15:12.152 --> 15:13.085
Today is my birthday

15:13.153 --> 15:16.088
and I'm going to do

15:16.156 --> 15:18.224
whatever I wanna do.

15:24.464 --> 15:26.365
What was that?

15:26.433 --> 15:28.534
That's the Ders.

15:28.602 --> 15:30.736
Uh, all right.
Look.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.505
I've got $19 and a one hitter,

15:32.572 --> 15:36.776
all you gotta do
is give me that shark blimp.

15:36.843 --> 15:37.943
That's all yours.

15:38.011 --> 15:39.378
You just need to hand me--

15:39.446 --> 15:42.481
hand me the sharp blimp.

15:42.549 --> 15:45.851
The Ders is unleashed, yeah.

15:45.919 --> 15:46.852
Gather around.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.853
There's going to be

15:47.921 --> 15:48.888
a real show over here.

15:48.955 --> 15:51.457
Ders, I got it.

15:51.525 --> 15:52.758
I got your shark blimp.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.593
What do you say we go home
and give it a whirl.

15:54.661 --> 15:56.262
It's no use, bud.
He's unleashed.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.230
Gotta ride it out
like a hurricane.

15:58.298 --> 15:59.632
No, no, we're not riding
anything.

15:59.700 --> 16:00.633
Now, Ders, let's go home.

16:00.701 --> 16:01.834
Let's ride home.

16:01.902 --> 16:03.402
And you need to start
acting your age, man.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.837
What are you, 30?

16:04.905 --> 16:09.093
Ennnghhh, I'm 25,
dickhead, and that's a chop.

16:14.214 --> 16:17.350
Can I have some more tokens?

16:17.417 --> 16:18.978
Yeah, I'll go get you
some tokens.

16:28.816 --> 16:30.615
Hey Ders, how you doing, man?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.085
Come on.
Talk to me.

16:32.153 --> 16:33.086
He's refusing to get off.

16:33.154 --> 16:34.087
This is the saddest thing

16:34.155 --> 16:35.289
I've ever seen, dude.

16:35.356 --> 16:36.495
You're not a child.

16:36.661 --> 16:37.524
Do you have any more tokens?

16:37.592 --> 16:40.093
I wanna play pop-a-shot again.

16:40.161 --> 16:41.595
I got like the fourth highest
score on the thing.

16:41.663 --> 16:42.729
I'm not just going to give up.

16:42.797 --> 16:43.830
I'm not a quitter.

16:43.898 --> 16:45.933
- You need to chill out.
- Okay.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.101
This is the worst birthday
I've ever had.

16:48.169 --> 16:49.136
What?

16:49.203 --> 16:50.270
Remember those strippers
I got you.

16:50.338 --> 16:51.505
That was awesome of me.

16:51.573 --> 16:52.539
Wait.
You didn't get him--

16:52.607 --> 16:54.055
I-I got him--
you took my car.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.142
Yeah, that's true.

16:55.209 --> 16:56.143
He bought them.

16:56.210 --> 16:57.911
But I was--I made the call.

16:57.979 --> 16:59.101
I'm so old, now.

16:59.267 --> 17:01.114
You know, I thought
maybe if I said swag,

17:01.182 --> 17:03.550
and jammed hard to mash-ups,

17:03.618 --> 17:05.986
and tore sleeves
of cool golf shirts

17:06.054 --> 17:07.320
that I'd feel young.

17:07.387 --> 17:08.488
But it didn't work.

17:08.556 --> 17:11.023
I mean, I don't even know
what swag means.

17:11.092 --> 17:12.358
No one does, really.

17:12.426 --> 17:14.161
I just wanted to sound cool.

17:14.228 --> 17:15.762
You didn't, really.

17:15.829 --> 17:16.730
You kind of sound like a dork.

17:16.798 --> 17:17.830
Ye.

17:17.898 --> 17:19.700
Hey, uh.

17:19.767 --> 17:21.468
I crossed the line back there.

17:21.536 --> 17:23.770
Thought I'd try to make it
right, starting with some cake.

17:23.838 --> 17:25.238
No, I'm in a cutting phase
right now.

17:25.306 --> 17:26.473
I'd better not.

17:26.540 --> 17:27.840
Unless it's chocolate.
Is that chocolate?

17:27.909 --> 17:28.875
Uh, no, it's vanilla.

17:28.943 --> 17:30.424
Yeah, that will work.
Cool. Thanks.

17:30.590 --> 17:33.113
As for your busted up face...

17:33.181 --> 17:36.783
Thank you.

17:36.851 --> 17:38.385
Hey, uh--

17:38.453 --> 17:40.420
I'm sorry I knocked you
on your ass back there, man.

17:40.488 --> 17:42.456
But you said, "chop."
I thought you had a knife.

17:42.523 --> 17:43.924
I used to work
in a Chinese kitchen, man,

17:43.992 --> 17:46.326
I have seen some.

17:46.394 --> 17:48.629
Anyway, moving on.

17:48.696 --> 17:50.631
You're crying 'cause you're 25?

17:50.698 --> 17:51.965
But I'm 37.

17:52.033 --> 17:53.467
But you know what I got?

17:53.534 --> 17:55.700
I got meaning in my life.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.804
You'll see.
It's radical, dude.

17:57.872 --> 17:59.306
All right.
And it's real.

17:59.374 --> 18:01.208
He's right, you know.

18:01.275 --> 18:03.110
Turning 25 isn't the end.

18:03.177 --> 18:07.781
It's--it's the beginning
of something older.

18:07.849 --> 18:09.716
Yeah, it's definitely older.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.218
- Yeah.
- It's for sure, older.

18:11.285 --> 18:13.887
And oh, but you can do
a ton of cool stuff

18:13.955 --> 18:15.222
that you couldn't do before.

18:15.289 --> 18:16.223
Yeah.

18:16.290 --> 18:17.624
- Like what?
- Yeah, like what?

18:17.692 --> 18:19.826
You can get off your parent's
health insurance.

18:19.894 --> 18:20.994
Well, that will kick you off.

18:21.062 --> 18:23.130
My dad sends me countdown
e-mails.

18:23.197 --> 18:27.100
- It's bogus.
- Yeah.

18:27.168 --> 18:30.671
Guys, I think I know
what I need to do.

18:30.738 --> 18:31.902
But I can't do it alone.

18:32.068 --> 18:35.108
Now, look. Whatever you need,
I'm here for you.

18:35.176 --> 18:36.810
No, I mean, like,
I'm really hammered.

18:36.878 --> 18:38.879
I don't even think I can get out
of this ride right now.

18:38.946 --> 18:41.162
Okay sir, you can have
a seat. Thank you.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.383
All right.
Statute 7-b,

18:43.451 --> 18:45.452
let the proposed property tax
override fund the...

19:02.933 --> 19:05.906
Ladies and gentlemen!

19:05.973 --> 19:07.474
Please put your hands together

19:07.542 --> 19:11.445
for the next president
of rancho cucamonga,

19:11.512 --> 19:14.314
Anders Holmvik.

19:16.584 --> 19:17.918
Hey!

19:17.985 --> 19:19.617
Hello.

19:19.783 --> 19:23.256
Greetings,
my fellow rancho cucamongans.

19:23.324 --> 19:25.058
My name is
Anders Torfin Holmvik.

19:25.126 --> 19:27.394
I'm here to announce today

19:27.462 --> 19:30.497
that because I am now
25 years young,

19:30.565 --> 19:32.299
it's not old, it's young,

19:32.366 --> 19:35.802
I'm therefore eligible to run
for city councilman dude...

19:35.870 --> 19:36.870
And I'm going to do it.

19:36.938 --> 19:39.106
- Yeah.
- All right.

19:39.173 --> 19:41.575
So proud.

19:41.642 --> 19:42.809
Okay.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.512
Not today like, you know, maybe
down in like 2016.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.813
I've got a--

19:46.881 --> 19:47.948
some student loans to pay off.

19:48.015 --> 19:49.282
So get that out of the way

19:49.350 --> 19:51.685
and then I'm gonna be
up in your grills

19:51.753 --> 19:52.719
asking for votes, okay?

19:52.787 --> 19:54.254
So, consider this a warning.

19:54.322 --> 19:55.361
And here's a slogan:

19:55.527 --> 19:59.259
It's, "you can always
bet on Ders."

19:59.327 --> 20:00.794
That's my name.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.365
Excuse me.

20:05.433 --> 20:08.201
This is like a forum
we run for city council.

20:08.269 --> 20:09.236
I know, dude.

20:09.303 --> 20:10.771
I'm said, I'm going to run.

20:10.838 --> 20:12.372
We gotta stick.
I'll get him out of office,

20:12.440 --> 20:13.740
asap.

20:13.808 --> 20:15.542
Vote or die.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.133
Vote or die.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.045
Vote or die.

20:19.113 --> 20:21.414
Vote or die.

20:21.482 --> 20:25.585
- Please leave.
- Vote or die.

20:25.653 --> 20:26.600
We need you to go.

20:26.766 --> 20:27.587
Vote or die.

20:27.655 --> 20:28.894
Vote or die.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.624
So, I get to see you naked?

20:32.827 --> 20:34.400
You're driving
the convertible, right?

20:34.566 --> 20:35.401
Um.

20:35.630 --> 20:39.032
Come on.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.468
- Officer--
- You know what, Ders?

20:41.536 --> 20:43.503
Happy Birthday, bud.

20:43.571 --> 20:44.871
Yeah, I was driving.

20:44.939 --> 20:45.906
What's it to you?

20:45.973 --> 20:47.174
I've gotten plenty of duis.

20:47.241 --> 20:48.581
Give me another.
I don't care.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.510
I don't care, copper.

20:50.578 --> 20:51.678
The car's been reported stolen,

20:51.746 --> 20:53.127
and you've been driving
it drunk?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.514
Really?
I didn't know that.

20:54.582 --> 20:55.849
I didn't know it was reported.
