01:12.371 --> 01:15.002
I WANT TO SAY NO.

01:15.003 --> 01:16.269
I WANT TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO

SPANISH.

01:16.503 --> 01:16.670
NO.

01:16.671 --> 01:18.202
HELL YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO

01:18.203 --> 01:20.169
TAKE YOUR AK 15s.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.703
HE DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER

01:21.704 --> 01:23.936
BUT HE TWEETED THE AMMUNITION.

01:23.937 --> 01:25.502
$1,000 A MONTH TO TEN

01:25.503 --> 01:26.003

01:28.170 --> 01:28.370
THAT.

01:28.370 --> 01:29.170
NOBODY'S YET SAID HOW MUCH

01:29.170 --> 01:30.103
IT'S GOING TO COST.

01:30.103 --> 01:31.103
I'M FULFILLING THE LEGACY OF

01:31.104 --> 01:32.904
BARACK OBAMA AND YOU'RE NOT.

01:35.904 --> 01:36.936
WELCOME TO ALL OF OUR

01:36.937 --> 01:37.236
CANDIDATES.

01:37.236 --> 01:38.203
IT WAS A GREAT DEBATE.

01:38.204 --> 01:40.536
I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT

01:40.537 --> 01:40.770
TONIGHT.

01:40.770 --> 01:41.003
THANKS.

01:41.003 --> 01:41.937
DID ANYTHING REALLY CHANGE,

01:41.937 --> 01:42.904
ANYTHING ENOUGH TO MOVE THE

01:42.904 --> 01:43.303
NEEDLE HERE?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.636
I THOUGHT THE DEBATE OVER

01:44.637 --> 01:45.603
HEALTH CARE WAS REALLY IMPORTANT

01:45.604 --> 01:47.135
AND I HOPE I DID WELL.

01:47.136 --> 01:49.202
I THINK I DID.

01:49.203 --> 01:49.804
I THOUGHT I SAID WHAT I

01:49.805 --> 01:51.436
NEEDED TO SAY ON GUNS.

01:51.437 --> 01:53.502
I ENJOYED THIS DEBATE.

01:53.503 --> 01:54.602
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES

01:54.603 --> 01:55.070
THAT ARE IMPORTANT.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.269
EVERY WITH'S ENDURED THREE

01:56.270 --> 01:58.035
HOURS OF DEBATING.

01:58.036 --> 01:59.436
I THINK I'M THE BEST PERSON

01:59.437 --> 02:00.303
TO TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP.

02:00.304 --> 02:01.369
I'M BETTER THAN JOE BIDEN.

02:01.370 --> 02:03.002
I WAS OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT

02:03.003 --> 02:04.235
WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR AND WHAT I

02:04.236 --> 02:04.637
BELIEVE IN.

02:04.638 --> 02:05.703
TWO HOURS OF SPINNING.

02:05.704 --> 02:06.869
THE FACT THAT DONALD TRUMP

02:06.870 --> 02:09.235
HAS BEEN A FAILED PRESIDENT.

02:09.235 --> 02:11.202
CORRUPTION OF CORPORATE

02:11.203 --> 02:11.437
ELITE.

02:11.437 --> 02:12.070
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE

02:12.071 --> 02:14.436
2020 CAMPAIGN.

02:14.437 --> 02:16.336
THE WORD CONFISCATION...

02:16.337 --> 02:17.170
ONE COMMON GOAL THAT WE ALL

02:17.171 --> 02:22.536
HAVE...

02:22.537 --> 02:23.669
SPECTACLE AND GRANDEUR OF

02:23.670 --> 02:25.804
DEMOCRACY IN ACTION.

02:55.470 --> 02:57.202
WHY CAN'T ANYBODY DO TACOS

02:57.203 --> 02:59.936
LIKE THEY DO IN TEXAS?

02:59.937 --> 03:03.502
HE'S GETTING THE TRUMP TACO.

03:03.503 --> 03:04.270
I DON'T NEED TRUMP, MAN.

03:04.271 --> 03:08.070
I'M ALLERGIC TO TRUMP.

03:10.937 --> 03:11.603
I DON'T THINK THE DEBATE LAST

03:11.604 --> 03:13.836
NIGHT CHANGED THE RACE IN A

03:13.837 --> 03:15.369
FUNDAMENTAL WAY EXCEPT THE FIELD

03:15.370 --> 03:17.269
HAS DEFINED NOW A CLEAR TOP

03:17.270 --> 03:17.704
TIER.

03:17.705 --> 03:18.869
JOE BIDEN, ELIZABETH WARREN,

03:18.870 --> 03:21.236
BERNIE SANDERS.

03:25.337 --> 03:28.102
JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN THE

03:28.103 --> 03:28.704
FRONT-RUNNER SINCE THE DAY HE

03:28.704 --> 03:29.370
GOT IN THE RACE, HE'S THE FRONT

03:29.370 --> 03:29.904
RUNNER TODAY.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.803
PEOPLE LOVE HIM FOR WHO HE IS.

03:31.804 --> 03:33.502
MUCH MORE LIKABLE IN THE

03:33.503 --> 03:35.135
GENERAL ELECTION BUT HE'S A

03:35.136 --> 03:35.837
FRAGILE FRONT-RUNNER.

03:35.837 --> 03:36.403
YOU THINK?

03:36.403 --> 03:37.270
YEAH, I DO.

03:37.270 --> 03:38.070
TELL ME WHY.

03:38.071 --> 03:39.135
HE'S THE STATUS QUO.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.436
HE WANTS TO TAKE US BACK TO

03:41.437 --> 03:42.536
OBAMA, BUT FOR THOSE REALLY

03:42.537 --> 03:43.170
ENERGIZED DEMOCRATS, THEY WANT A

03:43.171 --> 03:45.369
REVOLUTION.

03:45.370 --> 03:47.102
HERE COMES ELIZABETH WARREN.

03:47.103 --> 03:49.736
MY REPUBLICAN FRIENDS AND THE

03:49.737 --> 03:51.235
TRUMP CAMPAIGN ARE SALIVATING AT

03:51.236 --> 03:52.836
THE NOTION OF GOING AGAINST

03:52.837 --> 03:55.069
ELIZABETH WARREN.

03:55.070 --> 03:57.135
THEY MAY REGRET WHAT THEY ASK

03:57.136 --> 03:59.602
FOR, I THINK.

03:59.603 --> 04:02.469
HER OVERARCHING MESSAGE IS NOT

04:02.470 --> 04:04.269
UNLIKE TRUMP'S WHICH IS THE

04:04.270 --> 04:05.636
SYSTEM IS RIGGED AND YOU'RE

04:05.637 --> 04:06.769
GETTING SCREWED.

04:06.770 --> 04:09.636
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS BUT

04:09.637 --> 04:10.936
IT'S THE GREEDY CAPITALISTS AND

04:10.937 --> 04:14.269
WE'RE GOING TO REDISTRIBUTE THE

04:14.270 --> 04:14.503
WEALTH.

04:14.503 --> 04:15.337
AT SOME POINT IT HAS TO BE A

04:15.337 --> 04:15.904
BATTLE BETWEEN SANDERS AND

04:15.905 --> 04:19.002
WARREN.

04:19.003 --> 04:22.202
RIGHT NOW BERNIE'S PROBLEM IS

04:22.203 --> 04:24.235
THAT YOU'RE THE NEW ONE WHO

04:24.236 --> 04:26.703
EMBRACES THE LEFT WING VIEWS.

04:26.704 --> 04:27.969
BUT, WHO'S THE CANDIDATE WITH

04:27.970 --> 04:31.469
THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

04:31.470 --> 04:32.103
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SUCCESS ON

04:32.103 --> 04:32.403
HIS RESUME?

04:32.404 --> 04:34.369
BERNIE SANDERS.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.736
BERNIE SANDERS ALMOST WON THE

04:35.737 --> 04:39.469
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOUR YEARS

04:39.470 --> 04:40.236
AGO.

04:40.236 --> 04:41.036
CAN'T COUNT BERNIE SANDERS OUT.

04:41.037 --> 04:43.336
ULTIMATELY THERE IS AMONG

04:43.337 --> 04:46.436
ALMOST ANY DEMOCRATIC VOTER YOU

04:46.437 --> 04:48.102
SPEAK TO A DEEP TERROR THAT

04:48.103 --> 04:49.636
DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GET

04:49.637 --> 04:50.170
RE-ELECTED HANDILY.

04:50.171 --> 04:53.469
AS A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS WHAT

04:53.470 --> 04:54.869
IT'S LIKE TO BE IN THE COCKPIT,

04:54.870 --> 04:55.670
HOW DO YOU THINK DONALD TRUMP

04:55.670 --> 04:56.437
STANDS AT THIS MOMENT?

04:56.438 --> 04:58.869
WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF TRUMP

04:58.870 --> 05:01.169
STANDS THE SAME PLACE AS

05:01.170 --> 05:02.402
STRATEGISTS DO BUT THEY

05:02.403 --> 05:05.569
UNDERSTAND HE IS WELL BELOW 45%.

05:05.570 --> 05:08.169
HE'S MORE LIKE AT 40, SO THE

05:08.170 --> 05:09.103
TRUMP CAMPAIGN, HERE'S WHAT

05:09.103 --> 05:09.770
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY.

05:09.771 --> 05:11.569
THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR

05:11.570 --> 05:12.303
GUNS, YOUR PRIVATE HEALTH

05:12.303 --> 05:12.970
INSURANCE, YOUR BORDER SECURITY

05:12.971 --> 05:19.736
AND GIVE AWAY$, , $1,000 TO EVER

05:19.737 --> 05:20.470
TAXPAYER, WITH YOUR MONEY.

05:20.471 --> 05:21.869
YOU COULD RUN A CAMPAIGN ON

05:21.870 --> 05:22.070
THAT.

05:22.070 --> 05:22.837
YES, YOU COULD.

05:22.838 --> 05:24.169
YOU HAVE RUN A CAMPAIGN ON

05:24.170 --> 05:24.370
THAT.

05:24.371 --> 05:25.669
HERE'S THE OTHER THING, DONALD

05:25.670 --> 05:27.235
TRUMP HAS PRIMARY CHALLENGERS.

05:27.236 --> 05:31.936
JOE WALSH.

05:31.937 --> 05:33.336
NOW MARK SANBORN.

05:33.337 --> 05:36.102
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A

05:36.103 --> 05:36.737
PRESIDENT IN THE MODERN AGE WHO

05:36.738 --> 05:39.903
HAS HAD A SERIOUS PRIMARY

05:39.904 --> 05:40.503
CHALLENGER WHO HAS GONE ON TO

05:40.503 --> 05:40.970
WIN PRIMARY ELECTION.

05:40.971 --> 05:46.135
GEORGE BUSH, JIMMY CARTER.

05:46.136 --> 05:48.703
SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORRYING

05:48.704 --> 05:49.603
ABOUT SMALL CHALLENGERS.

05:49.604 --> 05:50.836
YOU HAVE THREE TAKING ON TRUMP.

05:50.837 --> 05:52.202
REALLY YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE

05:52.203 --> 05:53.636
WERE LAST SEASON.

05:53.637 --> 05:54.803
WHERE WERE WE THE LAST TIME WE

05:54.804 --> 05:55.303
WERE HERE?

05:55.304 --> 05:57.536
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA,

05:57.537 --> 05:59.636
THE MUELLER REPORT.

05:59.637 --> 06:00.170
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT.

06:00.170 --> 06:00.570
GOOD POINT.

06:00.571 --> 06:04.069
THIS IS A MAN WHO IS ABLE TO

06:04.070 --> 06:05.969
ESCAPE THE SNAPPING JAWS OF

06:05.970 --> 06:09.903
DESPAIR AND DEMISE UNLIKE ANY

06:09.904 --> 06:11.369
POLITICAL CANDIDATE I'VE EVER

06:11.370 --> 06:11.570
SEEN.

06:11.570 --> 06:12.570
NOW WE HAVE THREE

06:12.571 --> 06:13.703
FRONT-RUNNERS IN THE DEMOCRATIC

06:13.704 --> 06:15.235
PARTY AND THREE CHALLENGERS OF

06:15.236 --> 06:15.603
DONALD TRUMP.

06:15.604 --> 06:17.035
ALL THESE CHALLENGERS, ANYTHING

06:17.036 --> 06:17.904
THEY'RE DOING HAS TO BASICALLY

06:17.905 --> 06:20.336
BE ON THE PERSON THAT YOU WANT

06:20.337 --> 06:23.202
TO SEE ON THAT STAGE AGAINST

06:23.203 --> 06:25.937
DONALD J. TRUMP.

06:30.303 --> 06:31.769
RIGHT NOW THE CANDIDATES ARE

06:31.770 --> 06:33.336
HEADING BACK OUT ONTO THE

06:33.337 --> 06:35.069
CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

06:35.070 --> 06:35.770
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOE

06:35.771 --> 06:37.569
BIDEN IN SOUTH CAROLINA TODAY

06:37.570 --> 06:38.070
COURTING VOTERS.

06:38.071 --> 06:40.636
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO

06:40.637 --> 06:40.970
GET FIRED UP!

06:40.971 --> 06:43.402
FIRED UP!

06:43.403 --> 06:46.703
THIS IS AN OLD TOBACCO FARM

06:46.704 --> 06:47.270
WHERE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN

06:47.270 --> 06:47.904
COMING SINCE THE 1880s TO GIVE

06:47.905 --> 06:51.936
STUMP SPEECHES.

06:51.937 --> 06:53.536
THERE'S A HANDFUL OF DEMOCRATIC

06:53.537 --> 06:54.370
CANDIDATES HERE TODAY.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.303
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF THE NOISE

06:55.303 --> 06:55.970
AND THE NONSENSE, YOU HAVE A

06:55.970 --> 06:56.970
HOME WITH ME.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.736
WE HAVE TO GET THE COURAGE TO

07:02.737 --> 07:03.337
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THIS

07:03.338 --> 07:05.869
COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.

07:05.870 --> 07:07.703
THIS IS A REALLY KEY STATE

07:07.704 --> 07:10.969
FOR FRONT-RUNNER JOE BIDEN.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.302
HE HAS STRONG SUPPORT AMONG

07:13.303 --> 07:15.302
BLACK VOTERS AND THERE'S A HEAVY

07:15.303 --> 07:16.969
AFRICAN-AMERICAN TURNOUT IN THE

07:16.970 --> 07:17.236
PRIMARIES.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.736
THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT IF JOE

07:18.737 --> 07:20.703
BIDEN STUMBLES IN OHIO AND NEW

07:20.704 --> 07:21.470
HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA COULD

07:21.471 --> 07:24.002
BE THE FIRE WALL.

07:24.003 --> 07:25.269
HONEST JOE.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.569
IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU THAT

07:26.570 --> 07:27.769
HE'S OLD OR THAT HE'S WHITE?

07:27.770 --> 07:28.337
NO.

07:28.338 --> 07:31.169
IF YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON, MEANS

07:31.170 --> 07:32.703
WELL, YOU'RE HONEST, I DON'T

07:32.704 --> 07:33.537
CARE WHAT RACE YOU ARE.

07:33.538 --> 07:36.069
RIGHT NOW WE NEED EXPERIENCE

07:36.070 --> 07:37.636
AND KINDNESS.

07:37.637 --> 07:38.669
I'M SO TIRED OF MEAN AMERICA.

07:38.670 --> 07:40.569
WE NEED TO REMOVE DONALD

07:40.570 --> 07:41.303
TRUMP FROM OFFICE.

07:41.303 --> 07:42.236
THAT'S THE MAIN THING.

07:42.237 --> 07:43.602
BUT I THINK JOE'S THE BEST

07:43.603 --> 07:44.769
QUALIFIED EVEN AFTER THAT.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.035
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, HOW ARE

GREAT TO SEE YOU.

07:49.270 --> 07:49.937
HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

07:49.938 --> 07:51.769
HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE IN

07:51.770 --> 07:52.437
SOUTH CAROLINA?

07:52.437 --> 07:53.370
FEELS GOOD.

07:53.371 --> 07:54.769
HOME FIELD ADVANTAGE?

07:54.770 --> 07:55.770
YEAH.

07:55.771 --> 07:57.669
AND NOW I AM PROUD AND

07:57.670 --> 08:04.002
HONORED TO GIVE YOU THE FORMER

08:04.003 --> 08:04.670
VPT F THE

08:04.670 --> 08:05.270
VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

08:05.271 --> 08:06.431
STATES OF AMERICA, JOE BIDEN!

08:19.537 --> 08:21.336
HEY BUDDY.

08:21.337 --> 08:28.869
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.202
THIS PRESIDENT HAS FANNED THE

08:30.203 --> 08:31.536
FLAMES OF WHITE SUPREMACY IN

08:31.537 --> 08:32.568
THIS NATION.

08:32.570 --> 08:35.369
THAT'S WHY WE MUST SPEAK OUT,

08:35.370 --> 08:38.169
ALL OF US.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.736
WE HAVE TO REBUILD THE MIDDLE

08:40.736 --> 08:42.936
CLASS AND BRING EVERYBODY BACK,

08:42.937 --> 08:43.570
BLACK, WHITE.

08:43.571 --> 08:45.369
LET'S GET UP, TAKE IT BACK AND

08:45.370 --> 08:49.536
LEAD THE WORLD AGAIN.

08:49.537 --> 08:50.170
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

08:50.171 --> 08:56.836
I APPRECIATE IT.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.803
WHEN I SAY PRESIDENT, YOU SAY

08:58.804 --> 08:59.437
WARREN.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.536
PRESIDENT...

09:00.537 --> 09:01.370
All: WARREN!

09:01.371 --> 09:03.636
ELIZABETH WARREN IS SAID TO

09:03.637 --> 09:05.035
ANNOUNCE THE MOST SWEEPING SET

09:05.036 --> 09:06.803
OF ANTI-CORRUPTION REFORM SINCE

09:06.804 --> 09:07.403
WATERGATE.

09:07.404 --> 09:08.836
SHE'S GOING TO SAY DONALD TRUMP

09:08.837 --> 09:10.536
HASN'T DRAINED THE SWAMP.

09:10.537 --> 09:14.102
SHE SEES THIS AS TRUMP'S BIGGEST

09:14.103 --> 09:15.469
VIEWPOINT AND SHE'S HERE TO SHOW

09:15.470 --> 09:17.869
HER FELLOW CONTENDERS,

09:17.870 --> 09:19.369
ESPECIALLY JOE BIDEN AND BERNIE

09:19.370 --> 09:20.903
SANDERS, THAT SHE'S THE ONE TO

09:20.904 --> 09:23.402
GO TOE-TO-TOE WITH DONALD J.

09:23.403 --> 09:29.602
TRUMP IN THE CAGE MATCH OF 2020.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.769
IS ELIZABETH WOMAN THERE?

09:32.770 --> 09:33.236
THERE SHE IS?

09:33.237 --> 09:34.903
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT HER CHANCES

09:34.904 --> 09:35.670
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP?

09:35.670 --> 09:36.437
I DON'T.

09:36.438 --> 09:38.903
I WILL BE GLAD TO SEE HER IN A

09:38.904 --> 09:39.136
DEBATE.

09:39.136 --> 09:39.937
SHE IS SO SMART AND SUCH A GOOD

09:39.937 --> 09:40.403
LEGAL MIND.

09:40.403 --> 09:41.036
I THINK SHE'S GOING TO CUT HIM

09:41.037 --> 09:49.037
INTO SMALL PIECES.

09:51.370 --> 09:52.903
WITHOUT FURTHER OR DO,

09:52.904 --> 09:53.904
ELIZABETH WARREN.

09:56.270 --> 10:04.135
HELLO, NEW YORK.

10:04.136 --> 10:09.336
WHEN YOU SEE A GOVERNMENT THAT

10:09.337 --> 10:11.436
WORKS GREAT FOR THOSE WITH MONEY

10:11.437 --> 10:12.469
AND CONNECTIONS AND DOESN'T WORK

10:12.470 --> 10:16.536
FOR MUCH OF ANYONE ELSE, THAT'S

10:16.537 --> 10:17.470
CORRUPTION, PLAIN AND SIMPLE,

10:17.471 --> 10:19.703
AND WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT FOR

10:19.704 --> 10:22.503
WHAT IT IS.

10:23.003 --> 10:28.569
WE NEED TO CALL IT OUT IN THE

10:28.570 --> 10:29.337
OVAL OFFICE.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.602
DONALD TRUMP IS CORRUPTION IN

10:31.603 --> 10:32.769
THE FLESH.

10:32.770 --> 10:36.836
WE MUST ROOT IT OUT AND RETURN

10:36.837 --> 10:39.637
OUR DEMOCRACY TO THE PEOPLE.

10:45.804 --> 10:51.269
THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS

10:51.270 --> 10:51.937
WANT TO DEMOLISH EVERYTHING THAT

10:51.937 --> 10:52.570
WE GAINED.

10:52.571 --> 10:54.269
THEY WANT TO RAISE YOUR TAXES.

10:54.270 --> 10:55.669
THEY WANT TO BURY YOU IN

10:55.670 --> 10:56.103
REGULATION.

10:56.104 --> 10:57.369
THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR

10:57.370 --> 10:57.970
HEALTH INSURANCE, 180 MILLION

10:57.971 --> 11:01.403
AMERICANS.

11:03.470 --> 11:05.402
LEFT WING DEMOCRATS WANT TO

11:05.403 --> 11:07.469
CONFISCATE YOUR GUNS AND

11:07.470 --> 11:08.136
ELIMINATE YOUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHT

11:08.137 --> 11:13.703
TO SELF-DEFENSE.

11:13.704 --> 11:14.603
BUT DEMOCRATS WILL NEVER GET THE

11:14.604 --> 11:17.602
CHANCE BECAUSE NEW MEXICO WILL

11:17.603 --> 11:25.603
NEVER GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE.

11:31.236 --> 11:31.904
YOU KNOW, THE POCAHONTAS THING,

11:31.905 --> 11:33.736
I DID THAT BEFORE THIS STARTED.

11:33.737 --> 11:34.370
OH, IT'S COMING BACK, DON'T

11:34.371 --> 11:41.235
WORRY ABOUT IT.

11:41.236 --> 11:44.602
1,024th, THAT MEANS I HAVE MORE

11:44.603 --> 11:47.602
INDIAN BLOOD THAN SHE DOES, AND

11:47.603 --> 11:49.269
I HAVE NONE.

11:49.270 --> 11:52.035
AND THEN I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT

11:52.036 --> 11:56.936
WE HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS.

11:56.937 --> 11:57.870
THEY'RE NOT GOOD.

11:57.871 --> 12:00.035
YOU CALL THEM A RHINO.

12:00.036 --> 12:02.402
THEY'RE RHINOS, AND RHINOS ARE

12:02.403 --> 12:02.603
WORSE.

12:02.604 --> 12:04.703
WITH YOUR HELP, WE ARE GOING TO

12:04.704 --> 12:07.869
KEEP ON WINNING, WINNING,

12:07.870 --> 12:15.870
WINNING, WIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.670
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

12:17.671 --> 12:18.969
STATES SPOKE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR

12:18.970 --> 12:23.569
AND 40 MINUTES GOING THROUGH HIS

12:23.570 --> 12:25.703
STANDARD RIFFS AND RANTS BUT

12:25.704 --> 12:26.670
BARELY MENTIONS THE FACT THAT HE

12:26.671 --> 12:28.302
HAS A PRIMARY CAMPAIGN BEING

12:28.303 --> 12:33.002
WAGED AGAINST HIM NOW BY THREE

12:33.003 --> 12:33.503
REPUBLICANS.

12:33.504 --> 12:34.669
ANYONE WHO'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT

12:34.670 --> 12:39.035
THAT IS A FOOL, AND YET TRUMP

12:39.036 --> 12:43.035
LOOKS AT JOE WALSH AND MARK

12:43.036 --> 12:45.703
SANFORD, THE MOST CREDIBLE AMONG

12:45.704 --> 12:46.270
THEM, AND HE DOES NOT SEE

12:46.271 --> 12:47.436
SOMEONE WHO CAN DO ANY DAMAGE TO

12:47.437 --> 12:48.070
HIM.

12:48.071 --> 12:53.903
HE SEES SOMEONE WHO IS A JOKE.

12:53.904 --> 12:55.569
WE ARRIVED IN THE GLORIOUS

12:55.570 --> 12:59.402
BRIGHT SUNSHINE AND WE LEAVE

12:59.403 --> 13:07.403
AMID MEN IN PONCHOS.

13:14.970 --> 13:17.002
TALK TO ME ABOUT WHY YOU'RE

13:17.003 --> 13:17.270
RUNNING.

13:17.271 --> 13:18.336
I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I THINK

13:18.337 --> 13:20.135
DONALD TRUMP IS TAKING US IN THE

13:20.136 --> 13:20.770
WRONG DIRECTION AS A REPUBLICAN

13:20.771 --> 13:26.135
PARTY.

13:26.136 --> 13:27.336
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL

13:27.337 --> 13:27.537
RIGHT.

13:27.537 --> 13:27.770
WOW.

13:27.770 --> 13:28.203
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

13:28.204 --> 13:31.402
THANK YOU.

13:31.403 --> 13:34.769
SO, DONALD TRUMP...

13:34.770 --> 13:35.203
YEAH.

13:35.203 --> 13:36.136
HE GETS IN.

13:36.137 --> 13:37.469
YOU'RE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, A

13:37.470 --> 13:38.470
MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS.

13:38.471 --> 13:41.336
HOW DID IT FEEL FOR YOU AS A

13:41.337 --> 13:42.369
MEMBER TO DEAL WITH ALL THAT?

13:42.370 --> 13:43.869
I SPOKE UP AGAINST HIM AND IT

13:43.870 --> 13:45.469
PROVED COSTLY.

13:45.470 --> 13:46.703
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENDORSED

13:46.704 --> 13:49.002
SANFORD'S OPPONENT, KATIE

13:49.003 --> 13:52.402
ARRINGTON, FOR SANFORD'S SEAT.

13:52.403 --> 13:53.036
REPUBLICANS WHO CRITICIZE

13:53.037 --> 13:54.869
PRESIDENT TRUMP DO SO AT THEIR

13:54.870 --> 13:55.503
OWN RISK.

13:55.504 --> 13:59.002
THE FIRST ELECTION LOSS IN 25

13:59.003 --> 13:59.337
YEARS.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.069
POLITICS IS OVER FOR ME BUT A

14:02.070 --> 14:04.803
BUDDY OF MINE CALLED AND SAID,

14:04.804 --> 14:07.402
LOOK, GOD CLEARED YOUR CALENDAR

14:07.403 --> 14:08.036
FOR A REASON AND I KNOW WHAT IT

14:08.036 --> 14:08.203
IS.

14:08.204 --> 14:10.102
I'M LIKE, SO GLAD YOU GOT THE

14:10.103 --> 14:11.936
DIRECT CONNECTION, FILL ME IN.

14:11.937 --> 14:13.369
HE SAID YOU NEED TO PRIMARY THE

14:13.370 --> 14:13.937
PRESIDENT.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.669
I SAID THAT PREPOSTEROUS, CRAZY,

14:15.670 --> 14:17.469
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

14:17.470 --> 14:20.235
I LOST IN LARGE MEASURE BECAUSE

14:20.236 --> 14:20.737
OF THE PRESIDENT.

14:20.738 --> 14:23.736
BUT WE'RE RUNNING TRILLION PLUS

14:23.737 --> 14:24.903
DOLLAR DEFICITS GOING FORWARD.

14:24.904 --> 14:26.202
DONALD TRUMP HAS A COMFORT LEVEL

14:26.203 --> 14:27.402
WITH DEBT THAT YOU AND I DON'T

14:27.403 --> 14:28.736
HAVE BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE A

14:28.737 --> 14:30.936
DADDY THAT BAILED US OUT WHEN WE

14:30.937 --> 14:33.135
GOT INTO A PINCH.

14:33.136 --> 14:36.135
WE ARE WALKING OUR WAY TOWARD A

14:36.136 --> 14:36.770
FINANCIAL HURRICANE.

14:36.771 --> 14:37.903
IT'S GOING TO BE WORSE THAN WHAT

14:37.904 --> 14:39.202
WE SAW IN 2008.

14:39.203 --> 14:40.136
IT COULD WELL BE ON THE LIKES OF

14:40.137 --> 14:42.869
A GREAT DEPRESSION.

14:42.870 --> 14:44.169
SO I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL

14:44.170 --> 14:46.336
QUESTION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS,

14:46.337 --> 14:46.970
ARE YOU RUNNING TO WIN OR

14:46.970 --> 14:47.537
INFLUENCE THE CONVERSATION?

14:47.538 --> 14:55.102
BOTH.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.636
WE ARE HERE IN DES MOINES,

14:57.637 --> 15:00.202
IOWA TO MEET WITH JOE WALSH.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.469
JOE WALSH IS A FORMER ONE-TERM

15:03.470 --> 15:05.102
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WHO WAS

15:05.103 --> 15:07.202
ELECTED IN THE TEA PARTY WAVE IN

15:07.203 --> 15:08.969
2010, BECAME A RIGHT WING TALK

15:08.970 --> 15:12.602
RADIO HOST, MADE A LIVING

15:12.603 --> 15:13.236
ATTACKING BARACK OBAMA.

15:13.237 --> 15:15.869
HE HAS SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF

15:15.870 --> 15:17.402
TIME UP UNTIL VERY RECENTLY

15:17.403 --> 15:18.636
SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.

15:18.637 --> 15:19.570
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN JOE WALSH

15:19.571 --> 15:21.002
CAME OUT AND SAID, NO, I HATE

15:21.003 --> 15:21.337
DONALD TRUMP.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.602
HE'S UNFIT FOR OFFICE AND I'M

15:22.603 --> 15:24.736
GOING TO CHALLENGE HIM IN THE

15:24.737 --> 15:25.704
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.

15:25.705 --> 15:27.569
NOW, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

15:27.570 --> 15:30.069
THAT I HAVE MET JOE WALSH.

15:30.070 --> 15:32.002
THE FACT IS THE PRESIDENT IS

15:32.003 --> 15:38.035
A STONE COLD RACIST AND SO ARE

15:38.036 --> 15:38.203
YOU.

15:38.203 --> 15:39.070
I WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF RACIST

15:39.071 --> 15:41.602
BUT I WOULD SAY, JOHN, I SAID

15:41.603 --> 15:42.603
RACIST THINGS ON TWITTER.

15:42.604 --> 15:44.869
JOHN, SAY HI TO MABEL, THE

15:44.870 --> 15:46.502
TINIEST BLACK LAB IN THE WORLD.

15:46.503 --> 15:48.836
YOU'RE IN LOVE, AREN'T YOU?

15:48.837 --> 15:50.202
THIS IS PART OF CAMPAIGNING,

15:50.203 --> 15:51.369
MABEL.

15:51.370 --> 15:54.202
THIS IS HOW WE CAMPAIGN, MABEL.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.803
WHEN YOU DECIDED TO DO THIS,

15:55.804 --> 15:58.202
RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, YOU

15:58.203 --> 15:59.602
THOUGHT, I KNOW I CAN'T BEAT HIM

15:59.603 --> 16:00.669
BUT THERE'S IDEAS THAT MATTER

16:00.670 --> 16:01.903
HERE, DAMAGE I COULD DO.

16:01.904 --> 16:03.736
YOU KNOW THOUGH IT'S A LONG

16:03.737 --> 16:03.937
SHOT.

16:03.938 --> 16:05.302
I DON'T THINK AS LONG A SHOT

16:05.303 --> 16:07.002
AS SOMEBODY LIKE YOU THINKS.

16:07.003 --> 16:08.169
OKAY.

16:08.170 --> 16:10.769
WELD IS NO DUMMY AND SANFORD

16:10.770 --> 16:11.737
IS NO DUMMY.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.235
THE FACT THAT THERE'S PRIMARY

16:14.236 --> 16:15.536
OPPOSITION TO HIM, I THINK IT'S

16:15.537 --> 16:17.569
CREATED THE NARRATIVE THAT HE'S

16:17.570 --> 16:17.770
WEAK.

16:17.771 --> 16:21.502
I MEAN NO DISRESPECT TO EITHER

16:21.503 --> 16:22.769
GUY BUT MARK SANFORD SAYS I'M

16:22.770 --> 16:26.002
GOING TO RUN TO START A

16:26.003 --> 16:27.369
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE DEBT.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.102
THAT'S NOT WHY YOU PRIMARY

16:29.103 --> 16:29.403
DONALD TRUMP.

16:29.404 --> 16:31.569
SOMEBODY NEEDED TO CALL HIM OUT.

16:31.570 --> 16:32.403
WHEN WE TALKED YOU SAID I

16:32.404 --> 16:33.703
NEVER DID GET INTO THE BIRTHER

16:33.704 --> 16:33.904
STUFF.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.803
I GOT TWEETS HERE.

16:35.804 --> 16:39.969
100 MILLION IN ILLINOIS TAXPAYER

16:39.970 --> 16:40.603
MONEY TO BETTER POSITION CHICAGO

16:40.604 --> 16:42.869
FOR OBAMA'S PRESIDENTIAL MONEY.

16:42.870 --> 16:43.503
WHERE ELSE ARE THEY GOING TO PUT

16:43.504 --> 16:45.736
IT?

16:45.737 --> 16:47.569
KENYA?

16:47.570 --> 16:49.135
THERE'S A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE

16:49.136 --> 16:50.336
BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP WHO WAS THE

16:50.337 --> 16:51.769
KING OF THE BIRTHER MOVEMENT AND

16:51.770 --> 16:53.903
A GUY LIKE JOE WALSH WHO JOKED

16:53.904 --> 16:54.470
ABOUT IT TWICE.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.302
I WANT TO GET TO SOME OTHER

16:57.303 --> 16:57.537
THINGS.

16:57.538 --> 16:59.369
YOU AGREE WITH TRUMP CALLING

16:59.370 --> 17:00.337
HAITI A SHIT HOLE.

17:00.338 --> 17:02.969
HE SAID THE PROBLEM OF POLICE

17:02.970 --> 17:03.603
KILLING BLACK MEN DON'T EXIST.

17:03.604 --> 17:04.969
HE SAID MILLIONS OF WHITE PEOPLE

17:04.970 --> 17:07.102
DIED SO BLACKS COULD BE FREE.

17:07.103 --> 17:08.435
HE SAID BLACKS ARE LAZY.

17:08.436 --> 17:10.002
YOU SAID OBAMA ONLY WON THE 2008

17:10.002 --> 17:12.135
ELECTION BECAUSE, QUOTE, HE WAS

17:12.136 --> 17:14.536
A BLACK MAN WHO WAS ARTICULATE.

17:14.537 --> 17:16.469
YOU TALK ABOUT THE, QUOTE, WAR

17:16.470 --> 17:16.770
ON WHITES.

17:16.771 --> 17:22.002
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A

17:22.002 --> 17:23.868
PORTFOLIO OF 66,000 TWEETS.

17:23.869 --> 17:25.202
I'VE SENT THOUSANDS OF TWEETS

17:25.203 --> 17:30.436
AND YOU CAN'T FIND ONE, NOT ONE

17:30.437 --> 17:31.070
LIKE THIS, NOT ONE, SAYING BLACK

17:31.071 --> 17:33.536
PEOPLE ARE LAZY.

17:33.537 --> 17:38.369
THIS IS GOING TO BE ON TV, I

17:38.370 --> 17:39.769
ASSUME, BLACKS ARE LAZY, WITHOUT

17:39.770 --> 17:40.337
ANY CONTEXT.

17:40.338 --> 17:42.002
THAT WAS A TWEET DEFENDING FREE

17:42.003 --> 17:42.236
SPEECH.

17:42.237 --> 17:44.269
IN AMERICA I CAN SAY STUPID,

17:44.270 --> 17:45.203
HATEFUL THINGS LIKE THAT.

17:45.204 --> 17:47.269
THAT'S THE POINT I WAS MAKING.

17:47.270 --> 17:50.903
DO I BELIEVE BLACK PEOPLE ARE

17:50.904 --> 17:51.969
LAZY, NO.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.703
I'M GUILTY OF THIS, THERE IS

17:53.704 --> 17:56.936
STILL A CONSERVATIVE MEDIA

17:56.937 --> 17:58.502
SWAMP, OR AT LEAST ON OUR SIDE.

17:58.503 --> 17:59.769
I'D ARGUE IT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE

17:59.770 --> 18:00.003
TOO.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.502
YOU TRY TO BE AS OUTRAGEOUS AS

18:02.503 --> 18:05.002
YOU CAN AND SAY THINGS.

18:05.003 --> 18:06.502
YOU'RE ADMITTING THE NOTION

18:06.503 --> 18:07.969
THAT... EITHER YOU'RE A RACIST

18:07.970 --> 18:09.769
OR YOU'RE NOT A RACIST BUT

18:09.770 --> 18:10.836
YOU'RE WILLING TO SAY RACIST

18:10.837 --> 18:12.269
THINGS IN ORDER TO GET RATINGS.

18:12.270 --> 18:13.903
I'M TELLING YOU THE WAY A LOT OF

18:13.904 --> 18:16.769
VOTERS WILL SEE IT.

18:16.770 --> 18:18.936
THAT DIDOESN'T SEEM LIKE A REAL

18:18.937 --> 18:20.469
CONVERSION BUT A CONVERSION OF

18:20.470 --> 18:21.236
EX IMPEDENCE.

18:21.237 --> 18:23.302
IF I WERE FULL OF SHIT I'D

18:23.303 --> 18:25.436
STILL HAVE MY NATIONAL

18:25.437 --> 18:26.536
SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW AND SAYING

18:26.537 --> 18:27.537
EVERY DAY THAT DONALD TRUMP

18:27.537 --> 18:28.203
WALKS ON WATER.

18:28.204 --> 18:29.936
TWO YEARS AGO I SAID I CAN'T DO

18:29.937 --> 18:30.136
THAT.

18:30.137 --> 18:32.135
IT'S GOING TO BE A BLOOD BATH IN

18:32.136 --> 18:35.169
2020 WITH THIS GUY AT THE TOP OF

18:35.170 --> 18:39.235
OUR TICKET.

18:39.236 --> 18:40.703
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S

18:40.704 --> 18:41.403
BERNIE, ELIZABETH WARREN OR WHO

18:41.403 --> 18:41.637
IT IS.

18:41.638 --> 18:44.669
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS SAY

18:44.670 --> 18:46.936
SHE'S GOING TO DRIVE THE PARTY

18:46.937 --> 18:47.837
OFF THE CLIFF TO THE LEFT.

18:47.838 --> 18:50.869
SHE'S THE EASIEST ONE TO RUN

18:50.870 --> 18:52.069
AGAINST EXCEPT MAYBE BERNIE.

18:52.070 --> 18:53.369
I THINK SHE WOULD DESTROY

18:53.370 --> 18:53.937
TRUMP.

18:53.938 --> 18:55.102
ELIZABETH WARREN OR WHOEVER THE

18:55.103 --> 18:56.502
NOMINEE IS SHOULD DO EXACTLY

18:56.503 --> 18:57.503
WHAT I'M DOING IN THE PRIMARY,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.102
PUNCH THIS SON OF A BITCH IN THE

18:59.103 --> 19:02.936
FACE EVERY DAY.

19:02.937 --> 19:06.969
LAST NIGHT WARREN SPOKE TO A

19:06.970 --> 19:09.569
MASSIVE CROWD, BY HER CAMPAIGN'S

19:09.570 --> 19:11.302
ESTIMATE, 20,000 PEOPLE WERE IN

19:11.303 --> 19:11.870
WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.

19:11.871 --> 19:15.936
SHE WAS IN A SELFIE LINE FOR

19:15.937 --> 19:16.969
FOUR HOURS.

19:16.970 --> 19:18.202
TODAY THE SCRIPT IS BEING

19:18.203 --> 19:18.470
FLIPPED.

19:18.471 --> 19:20.569
SHE'S DOING A SMALL, INTIMATE

19:20.570 --> 19:26.269
TOWN HALL ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE

19:26.270 --> 19:26.537
FREEDOMS.

19:26.538 --> 19:28.536
WE ARE INFORMED THAT OUR

19:28.537 --> 19:31.202
PREGNANCY WAS EK TOPIC

19:31.203 --> 19:31.503
PREGNANCY.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.136
I'M SO SORRY.

19:32.137 --> 19:34.035
I KNOW THAT IF I HAD NOT HAD

19:34.036 --> 19:35.869
AN ABORTION, I WOULD NOT BE

19:35.870 --> 19:36.403
STANDING HERE TODAY.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.002
BECAUSE OF THAT I'M NOW CARRYING

19:38.003 --> 19:39.003
A HEALTHY PREGNANCY.

19:43.503 --> 19:44.569
WITH A BABY GIRL WHO I KNOW WILL

19:44.570 --> 19:49.302
BE A STRONG FEMINIST.

19:49.303 --> 19:50.803
THEY CAN TELL THAT NOW IN

19:50.804 --> 19:51.370
GENETIC TESTING.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.370
I LOVE THAT.

20:01.537 --> 20:03.235
SENATOR WARREN, WELCOME TO

20:03.236 --> 20:03.603
NEW YORK CITY.

20:03.603 --> 20:03.970
THANK YOU.

20:03.971 --> 20:05.002
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WELL ON

20:05.003 --> 20:06.235

20:06.236 --> 20:07.003
DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE?

20:07.004 --> 20:08.903
I'M OUT THERE FIGHTING FOR IT

20:08.904 --> 20:11.235
EVERY SINGLE DAY, AND REALLY

20:11.236 --> 20:13.369
MAKING THIS DEMOCRACY WORK FOR

20:13.370 --> 20:13.670
EVERYBODY.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.803
DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR

20:14.804 --> 20:17.002
SUPPORTERS OF BERNIE SANDERS OR

20:17.003 --> 20:18.536
VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THIS

20:18.537 --> 20:18.804
MOMENT?

20:18.805 --> 20:20.002
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR

20:20.003 --> 20:20.370
EVERYBODY.

20:20.371 --> 20:23.736
2020 IS OUR CHANCE NOT JUST TO

20:23.737 --> 20:27.135
SAY NOT TRUMP BUT 2020 IS OUR

20:27.136 --> 20:29.969
CHANCE TO BUILD THE COUNTRY OF

20:29.970 --> 20:31.836
OUR BEST DREAMS AND TO MAKE THIS

20:31.837 --> 20:37.836
DEMOCRACY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.737
THANK YOU.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.570
HOT OFF THE PRESSES RIGHT

20:39.571 --> 20:40.836
HERE AT NBC NEWS, THESE ARE THE

20:40.837 --> 20:44.002
BRAND NEW NUMBERS OUT RIGHT NOW.

20:44.003 --> 20:45.903
BIDEN AND WARREN BOTH RISING.

20:45.904 --> 20:47.836
SHE'S GOTTEN THE BIGGEST

20:47.837 --> 20:48.470
BOOST.

20:48.471 --> 20:49.803
SENATOR WARREN HAS BEEN STEADILY

20:49.804 --> 20:50.903
CLIMBING NOT JUST IN THIS POLL

20:50.904 --> 20:51.470
BUT BASICALLY IN ALL POLLS.

20:51.470 --> 20:52.470
Keith:

21:01.136 --> 21:03.636
WE'RE HERE AT THE CAMPUS OF

21:03.637 --> 21:04.303
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, HOSTING A

21:04.304 --> 21:07.936
TWO-DAY CLIMATE FORUM.

21:07.937 --> 21:08.837
MOST OF THE DEMOCRATIC

21:08.838 --> 21:10.336
CANDIDATES ARE HERE BUT THE ONLY

21:10.337 --> 21:11.569
CANDIDATE WHO'S IN SERIOUS

21:11.570 --> 21:13.803
CONTENTION TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC

21:13.804 --> 21:14.836
NOMINATION IS THE BERNIE

21:14.837 --> 21:15.070
SANDERS.

21:15.071 --> 21:16.102
I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT

21:16.103 --> 21:17.536
VIEW THIS AS AN ISSUE AND THERE

21:17.537 --> 21:19.336
ARE PEOPLE WHO VIEW THIS AS THE

21:19.337 --> 21:22.202
ISSUE.

21:22.203 --> 21:22.537
WHICH ARE YOU?

21:22.538 --> 21:24.235
CHRIS, CAN WE TURN THE MIC UP

21:24.236 --> 21:26.969
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

21:26.970 --> 21:29.035
CAN WE TURN THE MIC UP?

21:29.036 --> 21:31.002
TURN IT UP JUST A LITTLE BIT.

21:31.003 --> 21:31.770
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT

21:31.771 --> 21:34.235
THAN SAVING THE PLANET.

21:34.236 --> 21:36.336
HAVE YOU SEEN THE BAHAMAS?

21:36.337 --> 21:37.502
MSNBC COVERED IT.

21:37.503 --> 21:39.102
YOU'VE SEEN KATRINA, PUERTO

21:39.103 --> 21:39.937
RICO.

21:39.938 --> 21:41.135
THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR

21:41.136 --> 21:41.403
TOMORROW.

21:41.404 --> 21:43.269
AS ALWAYS WITH BERNIE, HE

21:43.270 --> 21:44.669
STILL HAS SOMETHING TO PROVE.

21:44.670 --> 21:45.936
HE'S WATCHED ELIZABETH WARREN

21:45.937 --> 21:47.569
RISE BUT HE'S LIKE, YOU KNOW

21:47.570 --> 21:51.903
WHAT, I AM THE O.G. SOCIALIST IN

21:51.904 --> 21:52.537
THIS RACE AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING

21:52.537 --> 21:53.070
FOR THE REAL DEAL OF THE

21:53.070 --> 21:53.704
DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON THE LEFT,

21:53.705 --> 21:56.869
I'M THE GUY.

21:56.870 --> 21:59.869
SAY LOOK, OF COURSE CLIMATE

21:59.870 --> 22:01.636
CHANGE IS REAL BUT LET'S NOT

22:01.637 --> 22:02.470
OVERDO IT.

22:02.471 --> 22:03.736
I BELIEVE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO

22:03.737 --> 22:06.536
SAVE THE PLANET, WE HAVE TO BE

22:06.537 --> 22:07.136
EXTREMELY BOLD AND EXTREMELY

22:07.137 --> 22:08.170
AGGRESSIVE.

22:16.070 --> 22:19.169
THE STORY THAT'S GOT ALL OF

22:19.170 --> 22:19.837
WASHINGTON TALKING AND IT'S ALL

22:19.838 --> 22:22.803
ABOUT THE UNKNOWN CONTENTS OF A

22:22.804 --> 22:24.202
WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT THAT

22:24.203 --> 22:24.804
INVOLVES PRESIDENTIAL

22:24.805 --> 22:26.903
COMMUNICATIONS WITH A FOREIGN

22:26.904 --> 22:27.270
LEADER.

22:27.271 --> 22:29.102
TRUMP'S INTERACTION INCLUDED

22:29.103 --> 22:30.602
A, QUOTE UNQUOTE, PROMISE THAT

22:30.603 --> 22:33.336
WAS SO TROUBLING THIS INTEL

22:33.337 --> 22:34.303
OFFICIAL FELT COMPELLED TO

22:34.303 --> 22:35.236
REPORT IT.

22:35.237 --> 22:38.602
THIS COULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY

22:38.603 --> 22:39.803
IMPORTANT BECAUSE...

22:39.804 --> 22:43.002
WHAT IS TRULY A STRANGE

22:43.003 --> 22:43.637
WASHINGTON MYSTERY.

22:43.637 --> 22:44.470
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED

22:44.470 --> 22:45.070
ANOTHER FAKE NEWS STORY OUT

22:45.070 --> 22:45.270
THERE.

22:45.271 --> 22:49.403
IT NEVER ENDS.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.169
MY GOODNESS, MIKE McKINNON.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.803
HELLO, GOVERNOR.

22:55.804 --> 22:57.569
LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN.

22:57.570 --> 22:59.269
THE CAT WILL DRAG IN

22:59.270 --> 22:59.537
ANYTHING.

22:59.538 --> 23:00.569
THAT'S RIGHT.

23:00.570 --> 23:08.570
AND A NICE SEAT FOR ME.

23:09.937 --> 23:11.836
SO, SINCE YOU ANNOUNCED, YOU

23:11.837 --> 23:13.069
HAVE SOME FELLOW TRAVELERS IN

23:13.070 --> 23:13.804
THE PRIMARY.

23:13.804 --> 23:14.603
THAT'S GOOD.

23:14.604 --> 23:16.602
THAT WILL STIR UP THE POT AND

23:16.603 --> 23:18.836
MAKE IT SEEM LESS LIKE A

23:18.837 --> 23:19.903
SOLITARY SOLDIER PLANTING A FLAG

23:19.904 --> 23:22.569
IN THE WILDERNESS.

23:22.570 --> 23:24.069
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE NEWS

23:24.070 --> 23:25.969
OF THE WEEK.

23:25.970 --> 23:26.570
SOMEBODY HEARD THE PRESIDENT

23:26.571 --> 23:29.869
TALK WITH A FOREIGN LEADER AND

23:29.870 --> 23:30.403
SENT IT TO THE INSPECTOR

23:30.403 --> 23:30.637
GENERAL.

23:30.638 --> 23:32.969
YOU COME FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT

23:32.970 --> 23:33.270
BACKGROUND.

23:33.270 --> 23:33.870
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS

23:33.871 --> 23:35.135
ABOUT THIS WHISTLEBLOWER.

23:35.136 --> 23:36.436
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW THE

23:36.437 --> 23:36.970
DETAILS.

23:36.971 --> 23:38.536
IF ALL IT WAS WAS PRESIDENT

23:38.537 --> 23:41.035
TRUMP SAYING TO A FOREIGN LEADER

23:41.036 --> 23:43.202
IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, I

23:43.203 --> 23:44.436
PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER HANG

23:44.437 --> 23:46.869
YOU OUT TO DRY IN THIS OR I WILL

23:46.870 --> 23:49.235
WATCH YOUR BACK ON THIS, THAT'S

23:49.236 --> 23:52.235
TOTALLY WITHIN ALLOWABLE

23:52.236 --> 23:52.503
DISCOURSE.

23:52.504 --> 23:53.969
BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE,

23:53.970 --> 23:58.903
WOULD THE IG POINT IT OUT?

23:58.904 --> 24:00.035
DONALD TRUMP IS THE GUY WHO

24:00.036 --> 24:02.969
SAT DOWN WITH THE RUSSIAN

24:02.970 --> 24:04.903
AMBASSADOR, KISLYAK, IN THE OVAL

24:04.904 --> 24:06.502
OFFICE, WITH NO AMERICAN PRESS

24:06.503 --> 24:08.469
ALLOWED, SO HE'LL DO FUNNY

24:08.470 --> 24:09.036
STUFF.

24:09.037 --> 24:10.769
I THINK AT SOME LEVEL, HE'S

24:10.770 --> 24:11.803
CERTAINLY SCARED OF FAILURE.

24:11.804 --> 24:13.469
THAT'S THE REASON WHY HE CALLS

24:13.470 --> 24:14.270
SO MANY PEOPLE LOSERS.

24:14.271 --> 24:16.369
HE'S SCARED THAT HE'S A LOSER.

24:16.370 --> 24:21.803
HE PROJECTS INCESSANTLY, I,

24:21.804 --> 24:26.969
DONALD J. TRUMP, AM A VERY

24:26.970 --> 24:33.502
STABLE GENIUS.

24:33.503 --> 24:38.602
WE'VE GOTTEN BRAND NEW

24:38.603 --> 24:39.236
ASTONISHING REPORTING AT THE

24:39.237 --> 24:41.602
CENTER OF A WHISTLEBLOWER

24:41.603 --> 24:41.904
COMPLAINT.

24:41.905 --> 24:44.669
IT CENTERS AROUND UKRAINE.

24:44.670 --> 24:46.903
JOE BIDEN'S SON IS AT THE

24:46.904 --> 24:47.136
CENTER.

24:47.136 --> 24:48.103
"THE WASHINGTON POST" AND

24:48.103 --> 24:48.737
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTED

24:48.738 --> 24:50.569
THAT THE FOREIGN LEADER THE

24:50.570 --> 24:52.135
PRESIDENT WAS TALKING TO WAS THE

24:52.136 --> 24:58.302
PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE, PRESIDENT

24:58.303 --> 24:59.669
ZIELINSKI

24:59.670 --> 24:59.937
ZIELINSKI.

24:59.938 --> 25:01.369
THERE'S WILD SPECULATION THAT

25:01.370 --> 25:02.036
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS ENCOURAGING

25:02.037 --> 25:04.836
THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE TO

25:04.837 --> 25:05.704
INVESTIGATE VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN

25:05.705 --> 25:07.102
SON HUNTER WHO WAS ON THE

25:07.103 --> 25:10.803
BOARDER DIRECTORS OF A BIG DEAL

25:10.804 --> 25:12.002
UKRAINIAN GAS FIRM.

25:12.003 --> 25:13.302
THE FUNDAMENTAL BURNING QUESTION

25:13.303 --> 25:15.769
IN THIS MOMENT IS, DID THE

25:15.770 --> 25:17.069
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

25:17.070 --> 25:19.002
URGE A FOREIGN LEADER TO

25:19.003 --> 25:20.969
INVESTIGATE ONE OF HIS MAIN

25:20.970 --> 25:23.669
POLITICAL RIVALS IN EXCHANGE FOR

25:23.670 --> 25:24.670
FOREIGN AID.

25:24.671 --> 25:26.836
IT'S A RIDICULOUS STORY.

25:26.837 --> 25:30.135
IT'S A PARTISAN WHISTLEBLOWER.

25:30.136 --> 25:31.302
I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY

25:31.303 --> 25:31.804
LEADERS THAT ARE ALWAYS

25:31.805 --> 25:35.803
APPROPRIATE.

25:35.804 --> 25:38.602
THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN

25:38.603 --> 25:39.403
PRETTY CLEAR THEY'RE NOT GOING

25:39.404 --> 25:40.636
TO RESPOND TO THIS.

25:40.637 --> 25:41.203
THEY HAVEN'T YET.

25:41.204 --> 25:44.336
THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS

25:44.337 --> 25:44.737
RETICENT TO TALK.

25:44.738 --> 25:46.235
THE STORY IS UNFOLDING HOUR

25:46.236 --> 25:47.336
BY HOUR BUT WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO

25:47.337 --> 25:49.636
SEE JOE BIDEN.

25:49.637 --> 25:52.736
THIS IS WHAT AMERICA DOES

25:52.737 --> 25:52.937
BEST.

25:52.937 --> 25:53.537
SOLVING BIG PROBLEMS WITH BIG

25:53.538 --> 25:56.102
IDEAS.

25:56.103 --> 25:58.903
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE THING WE

25:58.904 --> 26:02.302
CANNOT DO IF QUEWE SET OUR MIND

26:02.303 --> 26:03.336
IT, SO LET'S GET ABOUT THE

26:03.337 --> 26:07.369
BUSINESS OF GETTING IT DONE.

26:07.370 --> 26:08.236
THANK YOU.

26:08.236 --> 26:08.937
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, VICE

26:08.937 --> 26:09.937
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

26:19.003 --> 26:21.636
WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE

26:21.637 --> 26:26.870
SCRUM WITH REPORTERS.

26:31.070 --> 26:32.302
NO QUESTIONS ANSWERED.

26:32.303 --> 26:40.303
LET'S JUST DO A LITTLE WALK.

26:46.637 --> 26:48.235
HE'S COMING OUT OF THIS DOOR.

26:48.236 --> 26:51.002
WHETHER WE ACTUALLY GET TO ASK

26:51.003 --> 26:52.836
MR. BIDEN ABOUT UKRAINE AND

26:52.837 --> 26:54.069
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S COMMENTS, I'D

26:54.070 --> 26:56.002
PUT IT AT A 30% CHANCE WHICH IS

26:56.003 --> 27:04.003
PROBABLY OVERLY OPTIMISTIC.

27:07.337 --> 27:11.303
ARE YOU COMING?

27:17.070 --> 27:18.369
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT

27:18.370 --> 27:21.069
TRUMP SAYS THAT YOUR SON SHOULD

27:21.070 --> 27:22.402
BE INVESTIGATED...

27:22.403 --> 27:25.069
ANY RESPONSE?

27:25.070 --> 27:26.170
GUYS, MOVE OVER!

27:31.470 --> 27:33.069
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

27:33.070 --> 27:35.102
GUYS, COME ON.

27:35.103 --> 27:37.102
COME ON.

27:37.103 --> 27:45.103
WAIT A SECOND, WAIT A SECOND.

27:45.670 --> 27:48.736
NOT ANY CREDIBILITY ABOUT HIS

27:48.737 --> 27:50.769
ASSERTION.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.770
I HAVE NO COMMENT.
