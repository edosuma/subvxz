02:08.720 --> 02:11.110
I don't understand. Where are we?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.669
You're in Harlsfleet, darling.

02:12.670 --> 02:14.159
Are we in prison?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.160
Hardly. Bags!

02:17.690 --> 02:20.690
Don't worry. You can
pick them up the other side.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.330
Are you a guard?

02:26.400 --> 02:29.760
We're not guards,
we're custody officers.

Ah, well, if we knew that!

No-one in this place knows
when they're getting their ticket.

03:16.930 --> 03:20.000
- Ticket?
- Airline ticket. To send you home.

yourselves up,

Yeah, I'm sure there'll be somebody
to help you with that.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.830
I'm sorry, sir?

04:10.950 --> 04:12.500
I wondered where you were, Captain.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.160
I was on leave, sir.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.120
I know.

04:16.300 --> 04:18.940
It was a leave. I was due leave.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.770
We've missed you.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.020
Welcome back.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.550
It's started again.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.640
You should do something about it.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.590
- Make a complaint.
- What for?

04:40.180 --> 04:42.180
You know what for.

Did I?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.000
You should have gone home.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.000
Maybe.

05:35.630 --> 05:39.500
I started thinking
about those two sisters.

05:39.850 --> 05:41.560
What bothers me,

05:42.260 --> 05:43.940
they weren't surprised.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.810
When their brother was killed.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.340
Maybe they were expecting it.

05:48.590 --> 05:49.960
Where are they now?

05:50.160 --> 05:51.560
In the hotel.

06:26.590 --> 06:28.760
- What, me?
- Yeah.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.160
Oh, this. I fell over.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.580
Where?

06:32.670 --> 06:34.950
- At home.
- Where's home?

06:35.330 --> 06:37.230
I'm staying with a mate at the moment.

06:37.450 --> 06:39.080
I'd had a bit of a drink.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.950
I got up in the night for a piss.

06:41.070 --> 06:42.760

06:42.830 --> 06:45.100
She's not coming in.

- Where is she?
- I don't know.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.090
Well, have you heard from her?

06:49.160 --> 06:51.920
Well, she rang me
and asked me to fire up the oven.

06:52.370 --> 06:54.990
I wonder, have you got the credit
card slips?

06:55.130 --> 06:57.830
- Yeah, sure.
- From last night.

06:58.620 --> 07:00.620
They're here.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.430
You got nothing for Mars? Karen Mars?

07:14.840 --> 07:16.860
I don't know. You'd have to ask Laurie.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.120
So it's just Mrs Mars said she'd
paid in advance.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.890
Yeah, it's possible.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.890

08:28.080 --> 08:30.470
I'm wondering if I can be any help.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.909
No. I just stopped by.
Is that all right?

08:35.400 --> 08:37.890
Of course it's all right, it's a church.

We shop around.
We go to the Catholic as well.

08:47.690 --> 08:51.490
Good. Our church says
there's no one truth.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.530
Actually...

09:01.420 --> 09:03.090
I wouldn't mind talking.

Come in.

09:10.180 --> 09:11.450
This is my friend Linh.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.080
- This is Laurie.
- Hi.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.130
Linh helps us out with the homeless,
so she's always in a rush.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.530
Sit down, please.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.300
You're still here.

09:23.750 --> 09:25.500

and speak to the police.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.010
You have to do what David told you.

Well, can't you get David to
speak to them first?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.180
I've got a home visit and then I'll
come back and find you.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.270
Do you have a problem with that?

09:58.160 --> 10:01.250
Sorry. It was wrong of me to ask.

10:04.510 --> 10:06.060
It's been a struggle.

down on foreign students.

She was out in the street.

Is it the killing that's upset you?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.440
Is that why you're here?

- You mean God?
- Yeah.

I prefer to say her,
but him if you insist.

Very clear idea. You?

and I thought I'd just get out.

11:42.450 --> 11:43.910

But if I do that, I'll just feel guilty.

Catholic more often.

- Laurie, what did you do?

11:54.460 --> 11:56.460

15:24.890 --> 15:26.790
Isn't that what we do now? Find her?

15:26.830 --> 15:28.290
You should get some sleep.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.650
I'm not going to sleep
until we make some progress.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.470
- Mm-hm.
- What?

15:32.650 --> 15:33.830
What?!

15:33.870 --> 15:35.470
Well, you may be
awake for a very long time.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.910
- What's this about?
- What's what about?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.320
Working through the night.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.090
Just because it's your first big case?

15:41.150 --> 15:44.280
Or trouble at home?
It's just stupid, over-working.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.960
When it comes down to it,
it's inefficient.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.070
This case means
something to you, doesn't it?

15:48.440 --> 15:50.160
Are you going to say what?

15:56.780 --> 15:58.570
So you have to talk to me, Sandrine.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.120
If you don't, then you know the problem.

16:00.340 --> 16:01.960
I fail. I don't pass.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.050
It's not a test.

16:03.150 --> 16:04.600
Don't think of it like that.
It's not a hurdle.

16:04.650 --> 16:05.980
It's a precaution.

16:06.860 --> 16:08.870
And it's in everybody's interest.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.560
You can't redeploy on operations
and you certainly can't go back

16:13.610 --> 16:17.110
to Special Duties until I'm
convinced you've put away the past.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.580
Yes. I know that.

16:20.300 --> 16:21.900
Well, I'm really feeling much better.

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
Since?

16:22.950 --> 16:25.460
Since we started this process.
It's helped.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.610
How's Regimental HQ?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.350
Good.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.980
- You're comfortable there?
- Completely.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.710
- No problems?
- None.

16:44.910 --> 16:50.620
I... I want to hone in
and talk about anger again.

16:50.770 --> 16:52.460
The notes from Camp Bloodhound

16:52.470 --> 16:54.850
say you arrived in Cyprus very,
very angry.

16:54.890 --> 16:55.960
Not angry.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.900
When you came back from
the tour? Straight after?

16:57.960 --> 16:59.960
No. Distressed.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.560
They specifically say angry.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.960
I felt responsible for what
happened in Helmand.

17:11.609 --> 17:13.550
In particular?

17:14.220 --> 17:17.970
The Afghan women
who were working for me.

17:18.609 --> 17:20.079
You get close to them.

17:20.609 --> 17:22.130
And losing your colleague?

17:22.339 --> 17:23.490
That too.

17:26.060 --> 17:27.230
Do you sleep?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.200
Perfectly.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.850
But it's about respect.

17:33.690 --> 17:35.350
Explain?

17:39.910 --> 17:43.680
My best friend was blown up
in front of my eyes.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.720
Elizabeth?

17:46.180 --> 17:48.410
I picked up the pieces.

17:48.970 --> 17:50.340
Yes.

17:51.690 --> 17:55.340
Bits of her all over the ground.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.450
Bits on my kit,

17:59.010 --> 18:01.760
bits in my hair.

18:04.970 --> 18:10.270
Even when I cleaned my weapon,
wiping bits off.

18:14.890 --> 18:18.240
I feel that if I forget her that
would be disrespectful.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.740
You were fond of Elizabeth?

18:22.340 --> 18:23.560
Everyone was.

18:33.900 --> 18:35.820
Well, it's...

18:37.300 --> 18:39.200
it's a balance, isn't it?

18:39.460 --> 18:42.340
Returning to normal life doesn't
mean you're betraying the dead.

18:42.510 --> 18:44.550
Sometimes that's how it feels.

18:46.830 --> 18:50.050
And you see danger everywhere.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.290
You're trained for it.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.270
Everything makes you suspicious.

18:57.550 --> 18:59.710
You become like a... an animal.

19:04.020 --> 19:05.550
What do you play off?

19:06.940 --> 19:08.340
Sorry?

19:08.440 --> 19:10.080
Your handicap?

19:10.130 --> 19:12.130
Oh, um...

19:13.810 --> 19:15.810
17. (HE CHUCKLES)

19:16.240 --> 19:18.240
Why, do you play?

19:18.340 --> 19:19.850
I played with my dad.

19:20.670 --> 19:24.210
Well, perhaps
we should play a round together.

19:24.770 --> 19:26.950
- (SHE CHUCKLES)
- Take your mind off things.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.340
Perhaps.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.250
(HE KNOCKS)

19:41.400 --> 19:43.050
It's open.

19:44.270 --> 19:48.110
We're police.
We're looking for Laurie Stone.

19:48.130 --> 19:50.130
(TV AUDIO)

19:51.230 --> 19:52.480
Are you her mother?

19:52.530 --> 19:54.570
I don't know where she is.
I haven't seen her.

19:54.620 --> 19:57.690
Since when? Regal Pizza say
she hasn't appeared for work.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.340
Well, she's not here.

19:59.430 --> 20:01.260
Do you have any idea where she might be?

20:01.440 --> 20:03.260
No.

20:04.510 --> 20:06.060
You have a choice.

20:06.340 --> 20:07.970
You can either let us
look round the place,

20:08.010 --> 20:09.400
look through her stuff.

20:09.450 --> 20:11.130
Or we can come back later officially.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.050
How do you suggest I stop you?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.260
Kip!

21:08.240 --> 21:10.340
- How much?
- It's about a thousand.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.240
So how long exactly since she left?

21:19.340 --> 21:20.990
She left as usual this morning.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.180
Did she?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.270
And did she say where she was going?

21:24.340 --> 21:25.900
I thought she was going to work.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.810
But then she rang me later
and said not to worry.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.070
Have you seen this money before?

21:31.340 --> 21:33.270
Do you know why she might have had it?

21:33.340 --> 21:34.640
No!

21:35.220 --> 21:36.980
Why, does she usually have
a lot of cash?

21:37.030 --> 21:38.760
Does anyone? (SHE CHUCKLES)

21:38.830 --> 21:40.830
I haven't seen that much in years.

21:41.220 --> 21:43.220
The point is this, there was a killing.

21:43.340 --> 21:46.490
Yeah. I heard about that.

21:46.530 --> 21:49.990
- What did Laurie say about it?
- She was very upset.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.340
Nothing more than that?

21:51.420 --> 21:55.110
She made my breakfast early
and then she went out.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.350
Okay. We're going to keep in touch.

21:57.780 --> 22:00.000
And we'll send someone round
to look after you.

22:00.340 --> 22:02.220
Are you going to take her money?

22:02.570 --> 22:06.020
As a matter of fact, we are.
But she's going to get it back.

22:06.820 --> 22:10.010
My dad said never let the police in.
They bring bad luck.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.350
Your dad was right. We do.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.280
Well? What do you think?
Something's going on.

22:19.340 --> 22:21.300
A thousand pounds in a sock drawer
seems strange to me.

22:21.830 --> 22:23.860
You don't kill someone for a grand.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.200
This postcode,
killing's two grand at least.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.680
A thousand might be for helping to kill.

22:28.810 --> 22:31.280
The place was employing illegals.
They paid everyone in cash.

22:31.340 --> 22:33.610
If you think about it, it's not
surprising Laurie's doing a runner.

22:33.640 --> 22:35.470
- But she didn't own it.
- No.

22:35.560 --> 22:38.340
She was just managing.
And even that's a big word for it.

22:38.470 --> 22:40.640
All right,
so she was caught in the middle.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.160
It was all going fine
till it wasn't, sort of thing.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.340
Another way of looking at it,
intentionally or not,

22:46.420 --> 22:50.180
she sent a man to his death and,
hey, now no-one can find her.

22:50.790 --> 22:52.480
The two things have got to be connected.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.340
Karen Mars says she paid on the phone,

22:54.420 --> 22:55.880
but there's no record of any
transaction.

22:55.910 --> 22:57.160
There's no credit card slip.

22:57.220 --> 23:00.290
So now we suspect mother of two
Karen Mars, do we?

23:00.340 --> 23:02.820
Murderess, is she, because
she didn't pay for her pizza?

23:02.890 --> 23:04.210
Well, no. Because she lies.

23:04.230 --> 23:05.320
And I suppose you think she's innocent

23:05.340 --> 23:06.720
because she's married to an MP.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.130
Not any more she isn't.
That was years ago.

23:08.170 --> 23:09.500
Oh, flame gone out, has it?

23:09.540 --> 23:11.790
And have we found out who
owns Regal Pizza?

23:11.890 --> 23:13.340
Yeah. A person in Boca Raton.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.470
And does this person have a name?

23:15.510 --> 23:16.990
Well, they have a registered office.

23:17.040 --> 23:18.790
So, no, we don't have a name?

23:18.820 --> 23:20.910
Meanwhile, I'm going
to go check on Mikey Gowans.

23:20.930 --> 23:22.340
- You do that.
- He's covered in bruises.

23:22.380 --> 23:23.820
He claims to have fallen
over the crapper.

23:23.890 --> 23:25.720
- And you don't believe him?
- Do you?

23:25.800 --> 23:27.970
And where the fuck is Boca Raton?!

23:37.810 --> 23:39.130
You're new.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.340
I saw you at roll-call.

23:41.520 --> 23:44.260
I don't understand. What is this place?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.860
Harlsfleet Removal Centre.

23:45.910 --> 23:47.700
It's meant to be detention, but it isn't.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.340
- It's removal.
- When did you get here?

23:50.410 --> 23:52.010
I've been here two years.

23:52.040 --> 23:54.410
I've been living in England
since I was three.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.010
My mother brought me here. She died.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.370
Now they've decided
they don't like my paperwork.

23:59.450 --> 24:03.360
I'm what they call an over-stayer.
By about 30 years.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.410
- Is she all right?
- She's fine.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.520
Whatever you do, don't go to the clinic.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.770
Don't do anything medical.

24:10.820 --> 24:13.320
They're a different company,
they're even worse.

24:14.010 --> 24:17.200
Still, it's better than
getting your ticket.

get last night,

Am I right?

27:03.810 --> 27:05.370
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

And as for you,
you're a fucking barefaced liar.

Why didn't you tell me
about this last night?

27:10.130 --> 27:11.960

smoke in front of the child.

house by Israeli shelling.

to do her much harm.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.780
Did you have a nice evening?
Don't you have a new one?

30:32.870 --> 30:34.780
Yes. This one's a banker.

30:34.850 --> 30:38.280
Very good. Aren't they all bankers?

30:38.340 --> 30:39.460
Not always.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.620
Investment fund managers sometimes.

30:41.650 --> 30:43.280
I've even dated private equity.

30:43.330 --> 30:46.260
There's a message on the
answerphone. I'll make coffee.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.490
Thanks.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.870
ANSWERPHONE: <i>Enter your password.</i>

30:55.260 --> 30:57.800
- (BEEP)
- <i>You have one new message.</i>

30:57.900 --> 31:01.220
SANDRINE: <i>I need to know,
did I get the right one?</i>

31:03.360 --> 31:05.360
- (BEEP)
- <i>Message deleted.</i>

31:12.310 --> 31:13.980
I've got Mikey downstairs.

31:14.070 --> 31:16.260
He's running a nice little drug
distribution business.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.950
Well done! Before we go in,

31:18.010 --> 31:20.850
Fuzz, do you mind telling Nathan
exactly what you told me?

31:20.910 --> 31:23.870
Uh, yeah, first thing, obvious,
the man's an expert,

31:23.940 --> 31:25.220
knows about forensics.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.580
- Also...
- Yeah?

31:26.660 --> 31:30.620
A shell was found at the scene
which we identified as military.

31:30.690 --> 31:34.030
The bottom of the case has
the letters RG, Radway Green.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.280
That's the manufacturer that makes
stuff for the armed forces.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.960
So the shooter's a soldier?

31:38.000 --> 31:40.590
Well, all I'd say is had access to
military ammunition.

31:41.290 --> 31:42.780
But it's British military?

31:42.820 --> 31:44.550
I'll give you more as soon as I have it.

31:44.620 --> 31:46.960
Doesn't sound like it's got much
to do with Mikey.

31:47.860 --> 31:50.170
Well, why don't we find out?

31:55.530 --> 31:57.320
Do you recognise this?

31:58.430 --> 32:00.230
Do you know where we found it?

32:01.470 --> 32:03.160
No. How much is it?

32:03.210 --> 32:04.790
There's a thousand in there.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.140
What I do is £20 packets.
I don't see that kind of money.

32:11.060 --> 32:12.870
Is it just certain customers?

32:16.440 --> 32:18.280
They say they want a special topping.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.000
Special topping?

32:20.280 --> 32:21.780
Who do they say it to?

32:24.070 --> 32:26.280
Who do they say it to, Mikey?

32:27.780 --> 32:30.120
It was my idea. I... I thought of it.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.280
Sure. But it's not you on the phone,
so who is it?

32:32.520 --> 32:34.480
Is it someone who needs money
to look after their mother?

32:34.530 --> 32:35.940
It's me. I distribute.

32:35.980 --> 32:38.279
I... I take the risk.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.580
Yeah, but she gets a cut?

32:43.450 --> 32:45.690
Look you can't expect me to say.

32:53.360 --> 32:56.280
Rakhee, we need an All Ports Warning
out as soon as you can.

32:56.330 --> 32:57.310
For Laurie Stone?

32:57.350 --> 32:59.430
Yeah, Laurie Stone, and someone
needs to go to her flat,

32:59.480 --> 33:01.560
- just in case.
- I'm on it.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.650
<i>"Dear Jane. I'm going to go now.</i>

33:21.280 --> 33:25.090
<i>"I've got to sort things out
for myself, whatever that means.</i>

33:25.850 --> 33:28.370
<i>"Funny how you're never ready
when the moment comes.</i>

33:28.480 --> 33:31.160
<i>"You think you'll be ready,
but you're not.</i>

33:31.550 --> 33:34.040
<i>"I knew what was right and I ignored it.</i>

33:34.490 --> 33:37.630
<i>"What can I do? Thanks for listening.</i>

33:38.280 --> 33:42.340
<i>"It means the world to me
to talk to a priest. Laurie."</i>

- Sandrine!

33:59.220 --> 34:00.570
Take it up, Amanda!

34:00.590 --> 34:02.190
Come on and get it!

34:02.280 --> 34:04.280
Push forward... Sandrine!

34:04.290 --> 34:05.330
Here! Here!

34:05.960 --> 34:07.230
Sandrine!

34:07.280 --> 34:08.550
Pass it back, pass it back!

34:08.590 --> 34:10.279
- Over here, over here.
- Sandrine!

34:10.280 --> 34:12.730
Forward... to the right... Sandrine!

35:13.070 --> 35:14.280
Hello?

35:15.770 --> 35:17.390
Hello?

35:18.620 --> 35:20.430
Is that you?

35:29.750 --> 35:31.250
Ah, excellent.

35:31.290 --> 35:32.440
The phone rang again.

35:32.490 --> 35:34.140
I heard you answer it.

35:34.230 --> 35:35.980
I told her to throw it away.

35:36.030 --> 35:37.420
Well, she hasn't.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.910
Why not?

35:39.540 --> 35:41.000
Parmesan?

35:52.280 --> 35:55.940
I don't like what's happening.
I smell panic.

35:56.430 --> 35:59.090
We can't find Laurie.
She's gone missing.

35:59.260 --> 36:01.460
- The flat's up there.
- Yeah, okay.

36:02.580 --> 36:06.370
The police are after her as well.
We just have to wait.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.260
DETECTIVE: Right, you two, upstairs.

36:08.700 --> 36:12.340
Sure. Whatever you want. No problem.

36:17.170 --> 36:19.230
- Well, this is an honour.
- Hardly.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.400
We don't get many Members of Parliament.

36:21.450 --> 36:23.110
- David Mars.
- Kip Glaspie.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.540
Kip Glaspie. Are you the...

36:27.290 --> 36:29.070
Yeah. I was.

36:29.560 --> 36:32.120
Goodness. The athlete. I remember
watching you on the telly.

36:32.170 --> 36:34.250
- That was... that was a bad one.
- Yeah.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.150
And you're the guy who wants to let
everyone out of prison.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.150
I did, until they moved me.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.230
That's why they put me into Transport.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.280
Listen, this is rather tricky.
Do you mind if we speak outside?

36:46.360 --> 36:47.450
Yeah.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.200
Well?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.050
This is difficult for me.

36:55.100 --> 36:58.100
I have to guess whether it's
possible to talk to you.

36:58.530 --> 37:00.790
It's a character judgment.

37:02.630 --> 37:07.280
I'm trying to guess what
kind of person you are.

37:07.400 --> 37:08.990
Guess away.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.280
Is this about your ex?

37:11.500 --> 37:14.280
No, as a matter of fact, it isn't.
It's about your witness.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.210
- Which witness?
- The Vietnamese girl.

37:16.280 --> 37:17.370
Hanh Giang?

37:17.460 --> 37:20.260
Well, she gave you a false
name for a start.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.450
What's her real name?

37:22.540 --> 37:24.920
Linh Xuan Huy.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.430
Why did she do that?

37:26.470 --> 37:28.930
A whole bunch of reasons,
nothing to do with the case.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.580
Where does she live?

37:32.740 --> 37:34.080
I'm going to find out anyway.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.270
In fact, I can't see what
you're doing here.

37:35.310 --> 37:37.150
All you're doing is kicking her
problems down the road.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.480
She knows that.

37:38.770 --> 37:41.390
Her residential status is uncertain.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.720
We're all very keen that the
focus of the investigation

37:44.790 --> 37:46.930
remains on the murder.

37:54.590 --> 37:56.750
You know I can't promise anything.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.850
No.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.520
But she's frightened.

38:02.070 --> 38:04.070
Linh lives with a priest.

38:04.210 --> 38:05.950
You're going to find all this out.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.240
Am I?

38:07.300 --> 38:09.700
Yeah, the priest, she's already
in trouble with the bishop.

38:09.770 --> 38:11.160
Why?

38:11.240 --> 38:12.700
Because she's a she.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.490
So what's your connection?

38:16.530 --> 38:18.050
I'm very good friends with the vicar.

38:18.370 --> 38:21.190
Actually, I'm more of an admirer.

38:21.580 --> 38:24.510
In this community, there are very
few practical people who do

38:24.570 --> 38:26.370
more than just talk about doing good.

38:26.450 --> 38:27.950
That's Jane.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.200
I hope you're not leaning on me.

38:32.260 --> 38:34.830
I'm not. I'm briefing you.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.080
Good.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.980
These are good people. That's all.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.270
Now, because she was on drugs,

38:44.460 --> 38:46.970
Linh was reluctant to tell you.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.280
She can't be sure, but she thinks
the killer was a woman.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.630
- A woman?
- Yeah.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.220
Did she see clearly?

38:54.280 --> 38:55.770
No.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.950
Okay. I need to see her.
Get her to come in, quickly.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.220
- I will.
- Is there anything else?

39:02.280 --> 39:04.160
Yeah, you should know...

39:04.220 --> 39:07.100
I signed her student visa application

39:07.140 --> 39:09.390
without knowing she was here illegally.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.640
Then at last I've met someone

39:13.680 --> 39:15.270
whose problems are worse than my own.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.560
(SHE PANTS)

(EXPLOSION, MEN SHOUT)

40:13.550 --> 40:16.520
- Let's go and see what the guv's saying.
- See you later.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.200
Yeah. See ya.

40:28.280 --> 40:29.940
I hope you're not coming in, sir.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.260
I'm waiting outside.

40:34.850 --> 40:36.620
I'm allowed to wait here.

40:36.870 --> 40:39.160
I am your superior officer.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.280
I can do what I want.

40:45.980 --> 40:47.650
I think this is yours.

40:52.190 --> 40:54.190
Will you fuck off?

40:54.280 --> 40:57.880
Will you fuck off and leave me alone?

40:58.500 --> 41:00.240
Sir?

41:26.700 --> 41:27.930
What was all that about?

41:27.970 --> 41:29.070
- What?
- Outside.

41:29.090 --> 41:30.100
Oh, I'll tell you later.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.260
- Will you?
- We're late!

41:31.290 --> 41:32.850
You didn't want me to hear.
What were you up to?

41:32.870 --> 41:34.560
Nothing. Nothing, trust me.

41:34.590 --> 41:35.860
- Fuzz.
- Yeah.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.690
- The Vietnamese girl, the witness.
- Yeah?

41:37.720 --> 41:39.390
She's now saying the shooter
could have been a woman.

41:39.420 --> 41:41.580
- When did she say that?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

41:41.650 --> 41:44.350
- Is it possible?
- Yeah, I don't see why not.

41:45.010 --> 41:46.580
- I was going to tell you.
- When?

41:46.610 --> 41:47.820
Straight away, as soon as I heard.

41:47.850 --> 41:48.920
I thought the witness was
meant to come in.

41:48.950 --> 41:51.020
She was. She's coming back.
She gave us a false address.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.670
What are you saying? She's an illegal?

41:52.740 --> 41:55.920
Oh, I see. Now I get it.
That's what the wanker MP was doing.

41:55.950 --> 41:58.140
- I didn't promise him anything.
- Oh, like hell.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.440
And you don't care that he was
the husband of a principal suspect?

42:00.480 --> 42:02.370
Karen Mars? Is she a suspect?

42:02.420 --> 42:03.820
What's the one thing everyone knows?

42:03.860 --> 42:05.500
Every week, on the same day,
at the same time,

42:05.510 --> 42:07.120
the same person orders the same pizza.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.310
With dope. And you don't think
that person's implicated?

42:09.350 --> 42:10.690
You don't think they set the killing up?

42:10.720 --> 42:12.930
- I have to be honest, I don't.
- Needless to say

42:12.970 --> 42:15.510
- you don't want to prosecute the girl.
- Oh, come on, be serious.

42:15.540 --> 42:16.580
I am being serious.

42:16.620 --> 42:18.880
If you'd have asked me, "How will Kip
react to a drugged-out illegal?"

42:18.920 --> 42:20.470
I could have written the answer.
"How she always reacts!"

42:20.540 --> 42:23.280
This is little stuff, Nathan.
We're on a murder case.

42:23.320 --> 42:24.900
Policing isn't scorched earth.

42:24.930 --> 42:26.100
No, and it isn't doing deals.

42:26.140 --> 42:28.990
I think it is doing deals.
I think that's exactly what it is.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.020
I'm Kip Glaspie. This is Nathan Bilk.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.040
This is a colleague
from the security services.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.740
- Do you have a name?
- Sam Spence. MI5.

42:50.790 --> 42:53.560
I'm here because we believe there's
a national security dimension.

42:53.620 --> 42:56.030
Yeah, I think we've worked that out
for ourselves.

42:56.530 --> 42:59.510
Always the same. Police can't get
a result on their own.

42:59.530 --> 43:02.530
We always have to step in
and save the situation.

43:02.680 --> 43:04.680
Like you did with Iraq.

43:05.670 --> 43:08.370
They're really nice women. Truly.

43:08.470 --> 43:09.970
Most of them.

43:10.210 --> 43:11.870
They all get on pretty well.

43:11.900 --> 43:13.080
You don't have much trouble?

43:13.130 --> 43:16.130
It's a lot like a slaughterhouse.
You need to calm the animals.

43:19.530 --> 43:21.350
They'll be down in a minute.

43:21.540 --> 43:23.540
I thought you were bringing
an interpreter?

43:26.700 --> 43:29.060
We're conducting this
interview in English.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.120
My English not good.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.850
Don't start this meeting with lies.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.119
You're an intelligent woman.

43:33.120 --> 43:35.120
- You have money.
- How you know that?

43:35.540 --> 43:37.950
_

43:37.980 --> 43:40.610
_

43:44.490 --> 43:47.820
Fatima, we need to know everything
that's happened to you

43:47.880 --> 43:48.990
since you've arrived.

43:49.050 --> 43:50.760
You say you've been working in a hotel?

43:50.800 --> 43:53.770
- Yes.
- Why were you living in a garage?

43:54.120 --> 43:55.800
We were hiding.

43:55.870 --> 43:57.720
Hiding?

43:58.000 --> 44:00.720
So you're saying your
brother was killed deliberately?

44:01.530 --> 44:03.490
The bullet was meant for him?

44:04.330 --> 44:05.900
Because?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.060
Because he knew something.

44:09.110 --> 44:10.259
What?

44:10.260 --> 44:12.690
- He had papers.
- What papers?

44:12.790 --> 44:14.720
Papers he found at sea.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.980
What happened exactly?

44:19.240 --> 44:21.160
Abdullah took over the boat.

44:21.370 --> 44:23.140
There was a fight with the captain.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.700
We had to look out for ourselves.

44:24.940 --> 44:26.970
We had to find a way to survive.

44:27.010 --> 44:28.130
What way?

44:30.110 --> 44:31.270
No. I don't want to say.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.900
All right, I'm going
to tell you something, Fatima.

44:33.940 --> 44:35.490
You say you came through Turkey.

44:35.540 --> 44:38.410
Yeah? Where? Izmir, I'd guess.

44:38.440 --> 44:42.750
Am I right? I know Izmir.
I know Basmane Square.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.190
I know every shop on the port
that sells inflatable boats.

44:46.260 --> 44:49.150
I know where you can buy engines,
where you buy petrol,

44:49.190 --> 44:51.100
where you buy life jackets.

44:51.140 --> 44:52.710
I know where you buy balloons.

44:52.770 --> 44:54.930
Did you buy balloons?

44:55.530 --> 44:57.530
Keep your possessions dry, right?

44:57.800 --> 44:59.670
I probably know the beach
where you landed on

44:59.720 --> 45:00.890
and the beach where you arrived.

45:00.950 --> 45:03.240
Was it Lesvos? Chios?

45:03.440 --> 45:05.250
- Samos.
- Samos. Okay.

45:05.860 --> 45:08.910
You're going to have to tell me
something I don't already know.

45:14.440 --> 45:16.160
We set out.

45:16.440 --> 45:17.930
Yes?

45:17.990 --> 45:21.610
The boat was over-loaded.
There were too many of us.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.540
And we were packed together.

45:23.570 --> 45:26.050
- I was worried for Mona because she's...
- Because what?

45:33.520 --> 45:36.940
Abdullah decided we did something.

45:37.410 --> 45:38.560
There was a fight.

45:38.600 --> 45:40.690
The captain was killed.
That's all I know.

45:40.740 --> 45:42.140
How was he killed?

45:42.780 --> 45:44.270
I don't know. I didn't see.

45:44.280 --> 45:45.940
(HE SCOFFS)

45:46.050 --> 45:49.160
Fatima, I'm trying to make
sense of this.

45:49.230 --> 45:51.680
Did the captain have a gun?

45:53.040 --> 45:54.370
Yes, I think so.

45:55.160 --> 45:56.830
So, somehow,

45:56.950 --> 45:58.950
probably what you're
saying is Abdullah must have

45:58.970 --> 46:00.450
taken the gun from him?

46:00.500 --> 46:02.320
Abdullah was defending himself.

46:02.360 --> 46:03.720
He had the right.

46:03.780 --> 46:05.170
He used the gun?

46:05.240 --> 46:07.820
And when we got to London,
they murdered Abdullah

46:07.860 --> 46:09.530
because he had papers.

46:11.020 --> 46:12.520
He knew who the smugglers were.

46:12.560 --> 46:14.980
Oh, so you can give us their names?

46:15.770 --> 46:17.490
I can't.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.220
No.

46:19.530 --> 46:21.040
I bet you can't.

46:21.190 --> 46:23.030
I'll tell you one thing.

46:23.420 --> 46:25.020
One thing only.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.740
They were English.

46:28.820 --> 46:32.350
You're telling us
the people smugglers were English?

46:33.780 --> 46:36.540
(HE SCOFFS)
I don't think that's very likely.

46:36.610 --> 46:37.710
It's true.

46:37.750 --> 46:40.860
Englishman owns the boat.
Englishman runs everything.

46:40.930 --> 46:43.340
Everything. Passports,

46:43.390 --> 46:45.130
trains, tickets.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.680
- This is A-grade service.
- All right.

46:46.720 --> 46:48.440
- You said you came from Aleppo?
- Yes.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.660
You worked in a hotel
before the city was destroyed.

46:50.700 --> 46:52.560
- Can you name the hotel?
- The Baron.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.670
I know the Baron. What street is it on?

46:54.740 --> 46:56.100
Al Mutanabbi.

46:56.170 --> 46:57.760
No.

46:58.620 --> 47:00.530
- Try again.
- I may have made a mistake.

47:00.590 --> 47:02.030
Yeah, you did.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.190
It's on Al Khandaq.

47:03.390 --> 47:04.970
No.

47:05.660 --> 47:07.570
The Baron Hotel...

47:08.030 --> 47:10.190
is on Baron Street.

47:14.570 --> 47:18.010
Your whole fucking story is a lie.

47:20.420 --> 47:22.900
You're no more Syrian than I am.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.190
You lost your papers.

47:24.250 --> 47:27.249
Please! We all know Syrians
automatically qualify for asylum.

47:27.250 --> 47:30.430
Suddenly everyone's Syrian.
What are you?

47:32.170 --> 47:34.850
I'm just a mid-level English racist,
but I do know the difference.

47:34.910 --> 47:36.800
You're fucking Iraqi.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.850
Therefore, you have no right to asylum,

47:38.900 --> 47:40.110
and if you think you can blackmail us

47:40.160 --> 47:43.220
by withholding information,
you're wrong.

47:43.460 --> 47:45.110
I don't trust you.

47:45.250 --> 47:47.420
Not till I have papers.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.930
A residence permit,
for me and for my sister.

47:50.980 --> 47:54.480
That's not how it works. Information
first and then we'll consider.

47:54.520 --> 47:56.520
And we don't do promises.

47:59.450 --> 48:02.420
Oh, by the way,
I don't believe in your Englishman.

48:02.580 --> 48:05.820
An English people-smuggler
and we don't know of him?

48:06.250 --> 48:08.250
Then why was Abdullah killed here?

48:11.820 --> 48:14.970
She's a fucking liar.
She'll say anything.

48:15.010 --> 48:16.420
I didn't believe a word she said.

48:16.470 --> 48:18.600
She'll say the Archbishop
of Canterbury's running day trips

48:18.650 --> 48:20.720
from Aleppo if she thinks
that'll get her a visa.

48:20.850 --> 48:23.160
- They're all the same.
- Who are "they"?

48:23.210 --> 48:24.680
You know perfectly well.

48:24.720 --> 48:25.890
Her brother was shot in

48:25.930 --> 48:27.850
the street because he knew
the name of the smuggler.

48:27.890 --> 48:29.310
Think about it.
What's your problem with that?

48:29.350 --> 48:32.100
- Who shot him?
- We haven't even had 24 hours!

48:32.160 --> 48:34.210
You people are utterly pathetic.

48:34.250 --> 48:35.670
You've no balls.

48:35.720 --> 48:38.140
You want to hand out visas
like confetti.

48:38.310 --> 48:41.250
You're not even police.
You're social workers. They know that.

48:41.350 --> 48:42.860
They'll hook you.

48:42.910 --> 48:44.910

48:46.260 --> 48:47.590
We don't even know their real names.

48:47.630 --> 48:50.190
Could be anyone.
Have you thought about that?

48:50.220 --> 48:51.720
There's no deal until she gives us

48:51.750 --> 48:54.140
the identity of this so-called
English smuggler.

48:54.180 --> 48:55.820
Or until we find the killer.

48:55.900 --> 48:58.060
Oh, yeah. Call when you do.

48:58.250 --> 49:00.510
Here, you seem smarter than her.
