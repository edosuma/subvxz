00:11.011 --> 00:13.179
<i>George Sr. had convinced his wife</i>

00:13.263 --> 00:15.724
<i>to join him in their search
for a son...</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:17.684
Nobody's chasing him.
What's the big deal?

00:17.767 --> 00:19.394
<i>...who thought he'd broken out of prison.</i>

00:19.477 --> 00:21.104
Well,
we just want to find him

00:21.187 --> 00:23.231
before he does something stupid.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.108
<i>Well, stupider.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:26.735
- My left, your right.
- Your left, my right.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.154
<i>Although, it is the only way</i>
<i>to ride one of those...</i>

00:29.237 --> 00:31.990
We have to get these manacles off.
We have to find a hardware store.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.533
<i>...when you're chained to a guy.</i>

00:33.616 --> 00:35.035
- My right, your right.
- My right, my left.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.619
I remember there's a hardware store...

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
my left, your right... or a Build-A-Bear

00:38.538 --> 00:40.415
I used to go to, but that was,
like, let me think,

00:40.498 --> 00:42.208
Justin Be-Bear is seven...

00:42.375 --> 00:43.960
that was, like, seven years ago.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
Your left, my right.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.629
<i>Why do you think</i>
<i>he'd be at the mall?</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:50.550
Well, the last time Buster ran away,
he came here.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.469
And this is where his favorite stores are.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.180
There's Drink-A-Juice
and there's Paint-A-Plate

00:55.263 --> 00:56.848
and Build-A-Bear and...

00:56.931 --> 00:59.184
Oh, there's a tiny train.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.519
Now, admittedly, he's not 28 anymore,

01:01.603 --> 01:02.687
- but...
- No, you're right.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.938
But don't you think
he would've smelled me by now?

01:05.022 --> 01:07.192
Oh, good point.
Maybe the Popcorn Plantation

01:07.275 --> 01:08.568
is masking your scent.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.945
Ooh, we gotta get you out
of the food court.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.073
<i>Now the story</i>
<i>of a wealthy family</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:16.367
<i>who lost everything, and
the one son who had no choice</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:17.535
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.835
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.092
<i>Buster was missing,</i>

01:32.175 --> 01:34.385
<i>and George Sr. was eager
to make it look like</i>

01:34.469 --> 01:37.138
<i>- that was something he cared about...</i>
- Oh, wow!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.515
<i>...in order to woo his wife.</i>

01:38.598 --> 01:39.808
Didn't I used to have one?

01:39.891 --> 01:41.559
Yes, but it was real.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.521
- ♪ <i>Sugarfoot, Sugarfoot</i> ♪
- That's what it was.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
- Let's get one.
<i>- Which is how Lucille</i>

01:46.272 --> 01:48.191
<i>- thought of a way...</i>
- Can you make one of those

01:48.274 --> 01:49.651
from a wallet photo?

01:49.734 --> 01:50.902
<i>...to let Buster know</i>

01:50.985 --> 01:52.529
<i>the authorities weren't after him</i>

01:52.612 --> 01:54.280
<i>- and get a little dig in.</i>
- Let's go.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.782
♪ <i>Sugarfoot...</i> ♪

01:56.116 --> 01:57.075
I have a better idea.

01:57.158 --> 01:59.869
Why don't you just pick out
anything you want?

02:00.495 --> 02:02.664
George, we should not
be spending money.

02:02.747 --> 02:05.750
We owe it to the Chinese,
and if we don't get them their money,

02:05.834 --> 02:07.669
they're going to be looking for us.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.586
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that because I have Michael

02:09.669 --> 02:10.755
at the Bluth Company

02:10.964 --> 02:12.841
going through the books,
and he's gonna free up

02:12.924 --> 02:13.925
some cash.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.469
You have Michael looking
through our books?

02:16.886 --> 02:19.764
<i>Where he had recently</i>
<i>discovered and printed...</i>

02:20.014 --> 02:23.643
- A map.
<i>- ...a very provocative piece of evidence.</i>

02:23.726 --> 02:24.811
There's only one way to find out.

02:25.061 --> 02:28.106
<i>And so, Michael set out</i>
<i>to get conclusive evidence</i>

02:28.189 --> 02:30.358
<i>that his parents were building a wall.</i>

02:31.693 --> 02:33.987
<i>Unfortunately, the speed of the printer</i>

02:34.070 --> 02:35.905
<i>made it very clear why</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.199
<i>Two Hour Teeth went out of business.</i>

03:02.891 --> 03:04.809
- Come on!
- Come on! Let's go.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.353
<i>Tobias and his family</i>

03:07.437 --> 03:09.731
<i>were also playing a waiting game</i>

03:09.898 --> 03:12.734
<i>during business hours
in the Tent City where they had found</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:14.402
<i>- a new home.</i>
- You know, if you add water

03:14.485 --> 03:15.528
- to the freeze-dried ground beef...
- Shh.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.363
...it tastes just as good
as any hamburger

03:17.447 --> 03:18.990
- I've ever had underwater.
- Shh. That was meant to last

03:19.073 --> 03:20.283
all week.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.659
Oh. Oh, duh.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.286
Damn. Well, you know what?

03:23.369 --> 03:25.747
I saw a guy pushing a shopping cart
full of supplies in it.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.209
That's what I'm talking about.
When he leaves it, I'll grab his cart.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.712
<i>But as it turns out,</i>
<i>Tobias had been squatting</i>

03:32.795 --> 03:35.089
<i>- in the very chain store...</i>
- Oh, it's right here.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.258
<i>...where his brother-in-law
was now trying</i>

03:37.342 --> 03:39.469
<i>to repair a chain problem.</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:41.387
Yeah, I see the problem.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.598
The leg chains are all mixed up
with the bike chain.

03:43.681 --> 03:44.807
I could cut the bike chain

03:44.891 --> 03:47.060
- if you want. We have a bolt cutter.
- Can't we untangle it?

03:47.393 --> 03:48.728
It's a rental.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.355
- Do you have time to wait?
- You know,

03:50.438 --> 03:52.357
maybe we could check out
that popcorn place.

03:52.440 --> 03:56.986
Am I crazy, or am I smelling popcorn
and Chanel No. 5 butter?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.404
Can we go get some popcorn

03:58.488 --> 03:59.906
and just leave the bike?

03:59.989 --> 04:02.700
- I'd have to cut the leg chains.
- Leg chains? No.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.995
These are stage manacles.
We were in a play.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.747
Well, if they're from a play,

04:07.830 --> 04:09.707
- they're probably not even locked.
- What?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.585
Have you guys even tried, uh,
just unclamping?

04:12.669 --> 04:13.878
Are you kidding me?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.839
We didn't even check.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.301
<i>Ironically,</i>
<i>finding out they weren't shackled</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:22.679
<i>was a bonding moment for the men.</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:24.430
That would've saved time
when we were trying

04:24.514 --> 04:26.683
- to get the pants over our heads.
- What's good about this

04:26.766 --> 04:28.142
is they're looking for two guys

04:28.226 --> 04:29.978
who are manacled together
on the run.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.021
- Ah.
- The Inside-Outside Bandits.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.234
So are we saying that it's safer
to go our separate ways?

04:36.317 --> 04:39.320
- Is that what you're saying?
- I guess so. But, I mean,

04:39.404 --> 04:40.822
- where will you go?
- Well,

04:40.905 --> 04:43.700
realistically I could
sniff out Mother somehow,

04:43.783 --> 04:46.577
but she wouldn't want me.
Maybe I'm better in prison.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.454
I'm no good on my own.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.712
Look, I'm not... I'm not in a hurry to,
you know, go it alone.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.423
I mean, if you want
to hang out, I mean...

04:58.506 --> 04:59.674
- You mean it?
- Sure.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.175
- Where would we go?
- Oh, I mean,

05:01.259 --> 05:03.177
we like the same things. We could go

05:03.261 --> 05:05.305
anywhere we want.
I mean, the most important thing

05:05.388 --> 05:06.431
- is that we're outside.
- Inside.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.515
- Outside.
- Inside.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.309
- Hmm.
<i>- Meanwhile,</i>

05:09.392 --> 05:12.437
<i>another father-son team
had had just about enough</i>

05:12.520 --> 05:13.896
<i>of their time together...</i>

05:15.773 --> 05:19.027
- Please be done.
- I think it's good.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.946
<i>...when the printing process
finally concluded.</i>

05:22.739 --> 05:26.492
- It is a wall.
- Oh, shoot, know what?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.619
We didn't uncheck
"Make Background Tongue."

05:28.703 --> 05:30.913
I mean, why do they
even call it Two Hour Teeth?

05:30.997 --> 05:34.125
<i>And the Inside-Outside Bandits</i>
<i>found a solution...</i>

05:34.208 --> 05:36.627
- Feels like we're outside.
- It feels like we're inside.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.129
<i>...to their temperamental mismatch.</i>

05:38.212 --> 05:39.672
- Sort of meets all our needs.
- Yeah.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.966
Are you hungry?
'Cause there's some dried food

05:42.050 --> 05:44.469
out there that's still
technically everybody's.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.221
You don't think we should wait
until the store closes?

05:47.305 --> 05:50.016
I mean,
we're technically in their display.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.517
Okay, here's what we do.

05:51.726 --> 05:55.271
When I go out, you just be still,
and if anyone looks in,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.440
you pretend like you're a mannequin.

05:57.648 --> 06:00.860
- Can you do that?
- You're looking at a boy who faked a coma

06:00.943 --> 06:03.154
for two weeks
to get out of a spelling bee.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.947
<i>As the final group</i>
<i>of the spelling bee</i>

06:05.031 --> 06:06.407
<i>- makes its way to the stage...</i>
<i>- That was</i>

06:06.491 --> 06:07.784
to get out of testifying.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.619
No, that was a three-month coma.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.455
- <i>Another no-show to testify...</i>
<i>- </i><i>Hey, before I go,</i>

06:12.538 --> 06:14.499
if something happens out there,
and I get caught

06:14.582 --> 06:16.793
and I don't come back,
I just want to tell you that...

06:17.377 --> 06:20.129
this... this... being with you has been...

06:20.880 --> 06:23.591
ah, it's been...

06:23.674 --> 06:25.385
I cherish it.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.221
My son.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.559
All right, fine. Be that way.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.063
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>Lucille had taken a phone call</i>

06:37.146 --> 06:38.606
<i>from the Chinese investors...</i>

06:38.689 --> 06:41.192
<i>...she was eager not to upset.</i>

06:43.361 --> 06:46.197
- Well, the Chinese want dinner with us.
- They're in town?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.534
- They want to go over plans for the wall.
- Wait.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.203
Did you tell them we don't have Lindsay?
We lost the election.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.540
We can't catch a break on this.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.376
It makes you not even want to do business
with a hostile nation.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.586
They're gonna demand
their money, and...

07:00.670 --> 07:02.672
Oh, this dinner is not going to be fun.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.217
<i>But being fun was something</i>
<i>George was eager to prove.</i>

07:06.300 --> 07:09.387
Know what looks like fun?
That tandem bicycle built for two.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.890
- How much fun would that be?
- What are you, nuts?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.392
I have to call the restaurant.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.811
You call.
I'm gonna check out the Tent City.

07:16.894 --> 07:19.439
They have tandem bikes.
Boy, would we have fun on that.

07:21.232 --> 07:25.069
<i>And that's when George Sr. did find</i>
<i>the more fun version of himself...</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:29.073
<i>His brother, Oscar.</i>

07:30.658 --> 07:31.742
Hey.

07:33.911 --> 07:36.080
I should've gone
to the Tent City in Santa Ana.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.040
You have Buster
stashed away somewhere.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.418
What do you mean, in a tent?

07:41.043 --> 07:42.837
Are you gonna turn me in?

07:43.171 --> 07:47.758
No one's chasing you, okay?
Buster's a free man. Here's proof.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.469
They throw these in with the posters.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.971
Actually, he's not technically free.

07:52.054 --> 07:56.893
He still has to officially sign out
from prison and pay their $75 process fee.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.229
So, hey, Daddy, you're the one paying.

08:00.521 --> 08:04.525
Gee, I'm kind of sorry
my time with Buster has to come to an end.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.736
- We're getting close.
- Tell me about it.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.614
I'm trying to win back Lucille,
but it's a little tough right now.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.157
I'm fighting against the competition.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.533
What, is she dating?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.327
No, I'm talking about Buster.

08:14.410 --> 08:18.247
And we're really bonding over
this "we miss our son" bullshit.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.751
Well, I'll tell you what.
You front me the $75 to sign him

08:21.834 --> 08:24.837
out of prison, maybe we keep
this "Buster's on the run" charade

08:24.921 --> 08:26.255
going a little longer.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.758
<i>And so a deal was made.</i>

08:28.841 --> 08:32.010
<i>But before Oscar could even
not share the news with Buster</i>

08:32.094 --> 08:33.763
<i>that they weren't on the run,</i>

08:33.846 --> 08:37.933
<i>Tobias would not solve a mystery
he wasn't trying to solve himself.</i>

08:38.017 --> 08:39.683
Oh, sorry, wrong tent. I...

08:39.769 --> 08:41.979
What am I doing, apologizing
to a mannequin that looks like...

08:42.063 --> 08:45.066
- Buster?
- Oh, guys, keep it down.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.735
I can hear you all the way in cano...

08:50.613 --> 08:51.948
What are you doing here?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.075
- Tobias?
- I live here.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.494
- So do we.
- Oh, not for long.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.329
Rumor has it they're gonna
knock down these tents

08:58.412 --> 09:01.123
- and put in a Santa Ski Village.
- Wow.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.501
Seems like we were just celebrating
the second of July.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.419
We're already talking
about December 19.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.755
Well, we're definitely
still on the run.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.507
Too bad
we can't go back to Maeby's.

09:09.924 --> 09:13.386
She had quite a sweet setup
over at the Spotted Palm.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.763
My daughter has a place
at the Spotted Palm?

09:15.846 --> 09:16.764
Yeah.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.893
She should get better acquainted
with her sibling and mother impersonator.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.271
No, you have to be 55 and older.

09:23.354 --> 09:24.939
Well, that sounds like a challenge

09:25.022 --> 09:28.109
to any family that wasn't
a ragtag troupe of folks

09:28.192 --> 09:30.194
whom I wish to become actors.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.741
<i>As it turned out,</i>
<i>Tobias's daughter, Maeby,</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:38.244
<i>had been playing a part herself,</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:41.122
<i>although she was eager
to recast the love interest.</i>

09:41.455 --> 09:43.040
Hey, how we feeling?

09:43.124 --> 09:44.333
Any better?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.626
- I don't know.
- The doctor said

09:45.710 --> 09:47.795
the headache should be gone at this point.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.630
But I'm having trouble tracking time.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.340
But I guess it's only been a day

09:51.424 --> 09:53.551
- since the accident, right?
- Oh, my God.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.886
I can't believe
you're asking me this again.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.306
- Have I asked before?
<i>- He hadn't.</i>

09:58.389 --> 10:01.559
- Every month.
- Oh, no. That can't be

10:01.642 --> 10:03.144
- right.
- Right.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.104
See? You always say "right."

10:05.187 --> 10:09.233
I'm sorry, it's just, Stan,
we've gone over this so many times.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.818
<i>No, they hadn't.</i>

10:10.901 --> 10:13.821
<i>In fact, this had only happened
a few hours earlier.</i>

10:13.904 --> 10:15.573
Oh.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.451
- I must seem like a broken record.
- Old man.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.996
You also always say "old man."

10:22.747 --> 10:26.459
Listen, Stan,
this isn't easy for me to say.

10:26.542 --> 10:30.296
I've let you stay here
because I felt responsible for...

10:31.797 --> 10:33.299
coming in just as those two men

10:33.382 --> 10:35.259
hit you over the head,
which you thought was me.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.638
And it wasn't because I was just trying
to stop them, you know?

10:39.055 --> 10:40.598
But before that,

10:40.681 --> 10:42.558
we did end things between us.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.352
I know, but maybe

10:44.644 --> 10:47.480
there's some spark, there's some way
that we can rekindle,

10:47.563 --> 10:49.440
now that I'm alone
and you're alone, and...

10:49.523 --> 10:51.108
Right, we're alone.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.277
I don't have two criminals to pin it on.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.738
Maybe we can try again.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.700
I was trying, Stan, okay?

11:00.076 --> 11:02.411
It's over. It is over!

11:03.079 --> 11:04.580
A real lady lets it itch.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.832
- She doesn't jam two fingers...
- Voices up.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.044
Hi, I'm Mrs. Featherbottom.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.798
♪ <i>Thank you for being a friend</i> ♪

11:14.215 --> 11:15.299
I'm Bev.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.135
♪ <i>Traveled down a road and back again</i> ♪

11:18.219 --> 11:19.804
And I'm Mrs. Bettywhite.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.516
<i>♪ Your heart is true
You're a pal and a confidant ♪</i>

11:23.891 --> 11:27.186
We're just three... 56-year-old women

11:27.269 --> 11:30.314
looking for a place
to rest our weary asses.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.191
Oh,.

11:32.274 --> 11:35.569
Hello.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.782
<i>Back at the cottage,</i>
<i>George Sr. kept up the illusion</i>

11:39.865 --> 11:42.243
<i>that he had no idea where Buster was.</i>

11:42.326 --> 11:44.745
I don't know about you,
but I'm... I'm so worried

11:44.829 --> 11:46.288
that I can't keep looking anymore.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.500
Me, too.
We have to take care of ourselves.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.503
Why don't we just order some dinner in?
What do you think of that?

11:52.586 --> 11:55.423
George, it's two o'clock. Go home.

11:55.506 --> 11:59.844
I was thinking, it could be a, um, dry run
for tomorrow night's dinner

11:59.927 --> 12:01.887
with the Chinese.
They're gonna be looking at us,

12:01.971 --> 12:05.391
Lucille, very closely,
and we have to be a real team.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.268
You know, in the Chinese culture,

12:07.435 --> 12:11.439
a good marriage portends
a good business relationship.

12:11.814 --> 12:15.025
I think I can eat a piece of fish
without giving away how I loathe you.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.861
Whoops. Now, see?

12:16.986 --> 12:20.906
It's those little inadvertent slips I fear

12:20.990 --> 12:24.410
will come out tomorrow night
if we go in cold.

12:24.493 --> 12:27.204
Well, then it's a good thing
I've asked my friend to stop by,

12:27.288 --> 12:30.624
who happens to be an expert
on the Far East, as it turns out.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.085
- Your friend, you don't...
- Oh, Dusty.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.838
Have you ever met George,
my soon-to-be ex-husband?

12:35.921 --> 12:37.965
- Ah.
<i>- They had met,</i>

12:38.048 --> 12:39.925
<i>when George, after a failed attempt</i>

12:40.009 --> 12:42.052
<i>at ocean balling to impress his wife,</i>

12:42.136 --> 12:44.764
<i>gerbilled up to the beach
that had been under the domain</i>

12:44.847 --> 12:46.891
<i>- of a surf gang called...</i>
- Get out of here!

12:46.974 --> 12:48.809
<i>- ...the Newport Bay Boys.</i>
- Locals only!

12:48.893 --> 12:51.187
What's your business on the beach, bro?

12:51.896 --> 12:54.273
I'm, uh, visiting...

12:54.356 --> 12:58.068
...visiting my wife, Lucille Bluth,
and I just...

12:58.152 --> 12:59.403
- What?
- Yeah.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.155
Well, that's why you look familiar.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.532
I helped her take down
all your pictures.

13:04.241 --> 13:06.577
You're Dustin Radler.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.079
Out here, it's Dusty.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.165
Sorry about the confusion, man.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.750
Yeah, this beach
has always been known

13:12.833 --> 13:14.877
as territory of the Newport Bay Boys.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.506
Okay, uh, I'll just...
I'll find my way out of...

13:18.589 --> 13:20.382
No, no, you're not using those steps.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.802
Those steps are just
for the feet of the Bay Boys.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.386
Get back in the ball, dude.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.681
But I... I... I ca...

13:27.765 --> 13:29.517
Okay. Could you tell Lucille, uh...

13:30.017 --> 13:31.393
that I... I died...

13:32.603 --> 13:34.438
doing something that looked fun?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.192
- Ay.
<i>- The Bay Boy?</i>

13:38.275 --> 13:39.860
<i>I ought to throw this guy out of here.</i>

13:39.944 --> 13:42.363
This is the goddamn expert?
Because the only thing he's expert at

13:42.446 --> 13:44.615
is getting sand out of his trunks

13:44.698 --> 13:46.367
and pissing on another man's tree.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.828
- And the law.
- And I play some guitar.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.832
And I know a lot about Eastern culture,
too. I surfed in 'Nam.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.167
- Oh, you served in Vietnam?
- Surfed.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.836
I <i>surfed </i> in Vietnam.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.504
Two group tours.

13:58.587 --> 14:03.467
Picked up a lot, too. Mostly tchotchkes,
but some cultural elements, too.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.302
He knows what he's talking about, George.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.430
We went for sushi last night,
and he never touched his fork.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.058
Well, a little bit for the rice.
It's the hard part.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.643
But not when the guy was looking.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.562
He didn't want
to insult the employees.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.357
You know, with all these Asia-y cultures
and, uh, whatnot,

14:18.440 --> 14:20.609
they all are interested in honor.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.029
They all understand
that your opponent needs to save face,

14:24.113 --> 14:26.323
for this is the only way you, yourself,

14:26.824 --> 14:28.492
- will save face.
- Oh.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.369
So, I just want to be clear with you.

14:30.452 --> 14:35.124
If you think that I enjoy being put
in the position of ridiculing you,

14:35.207 --> 14:36.750
intimidating you, emasculating you,

14:36.834 --> 14:38.460
you're wrong, little guy.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.254
- Could you...
- Wrong.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.549
Could you excuse us for just one mom...
I'm gonna talk to my wife.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.886
Yes. I will give you that respect.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.722
Maybe I'll just go upstairs
and watch the big TV.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.515
<i>But someone else</i>
<i>would soon show up</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.809
<i>who was tired of being emasculated.</i>

14:54.393 --> 14:55.477
Ah, of course.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.479
I knew you would both be here.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.149
Michael, finally.
We need this money.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.735
So, uh, how's that going?
Did you... Did you find anything?

15:02.818 --> 15:05.613
You could say that. Yeah.
You both wanted me to go look

15:05.696 --> 15:10.534
at the books, but I guess you didn't think
that I was smart enough to find this.

15:11.535 --> 15:16.081
This was a file on a computer drive
called "Gated Community."

15:16.457 --> 15:18.459
- What is that?
- Don't play dumb.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.546
- What's playing dumb?
- Stop it. You know exactly what this is.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.340
This is a border wall

15:24.423 --> 15:26.800
between Mexico and America.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.053
That doesn't look like a mouth to you?

15:29.136 --> 15:31.805
Well, you gotta get rid
of the tongue setting, and anyway,

15:31.889 --> 15:33.974
but on a regular printer,
I have more than enough proof

15:34.058 --> 15:36.018
that you guys are building a wall.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.436
<i>The </i> wall, okay?

15:37.519 --> 15:39.188
Between America and Mexico.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.398
A wall, by the way,
that you once claimed

15:41.482 --> 15:42.566
- to be on the other side of.
- No.

15:42.650 --> 15:46.278
The property is
on the other side of the wall.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.448
Th... That's all over now
because the Mexican Romney said

15:49.531 --> 15:50.658
<i>no refundo.</i>

15:50.741 --> 15:52.785
I mean, we can't even pay back
the investors.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.495
They're Chinese.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.413
There's Chinese Romneys?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.416
No, the only Romneys
are the Mexican Romneys.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.502
- Well, and the regular Romneys.
- Well, I mean, yes.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.379
Obviously the... the regular Romneys,
but...

16:03.462 --> 16:05.965
So you spent Chinese money
that you cannot return,

16:06.048 --> 16:09.009
and you wanted me to look
in the books, so that I would

16:09.343 --> 16:13.097
do the right thing for the family
and offer to sell off Sudden Valley?

16:13.180 --> 16:16.016
The only thing that you cannot sell off
without me, right?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.185
And then what,
you give the money to the Chinese?

16:18.268 --> 16:20.729
We just wanted to tell them
where we were first going

16:20.813 --> 16:23.065
to build a... a model wall, a prototype.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.067
By that time,
there will have been the election,

16:25.150 --> 16:26.860
and Hillary doesn't want a wall.

16:27.528 --> 16:28.862
Yes, that is a good point.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.533
I wish her voice weren't so grating.
Oh, that voice!

16:32.616 --> 16:34.076
Shrillary.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.829
You okay? Is everybody all right?

16:36.912 --> 16:38.038
Yeah, we're fine. Go on.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.832
- Go on upstairs.
- Right on.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.085
I got an idea. Why don't you just try
being honest with the Chinese?

16:45.629 --> 16:46.505
In what way?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.340
You tell them the truth, Dad.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.551
- What truth?
- You made a mistake.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.094
You lost the money. You feel bad.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.179
Nothing you can do.
You hope they understand.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.600
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.144
Oh, good. You better figure it out,

17:00.227 --> 17:02.438
'cause I'm not gonna let you
ruin the family again.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.189
This generation.

17:04.271 --> 17:06.775
They go to one therapy session,
and all of a sudden

17:06.858 --> 17:08.402
their parents are "terrible people,"

17:08.483 --> 17:10.279
because they once sold tract homes to...

17:10.612 --> 17:12.195
God, who even remembers now?

17:13.991 --> 17:15.075
Saddam Hussein.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.867
Yeah. So... I mean, something like that.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.454
<i>Michael's parents</i>
<i>weren't the only ones</i>

17:19.538 --> 17:21.204
<i>using him for Sudden Valley,</i>

17:21.290 --> 17:22.665
<i>as Oscar,
who was trying to convince Buster</i>

17:22.750 --> 17:24.334
<i>they were still fugitives,</i>

17:24.416 --> 17:26.670
<i>had agreed to move into the attic.</i>

17:26.752 --> 17:30.049
Are you sure nobody saw us get
in the truck once we found it?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.593
Yeah, can you believe we finally
come across the getaway truck,

17:32.676 --> 17:35.596
right after we find out
we're no longer, uh...

17:36.472 --> 17:37.639
I mean, I hope not.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.350
- Me, too. Me, too.
- It didn't help things

17:40.434 --> 17:42.144
when your hand flew off
on the 405, but...

17:42.227 --> 17:43.729
Well, it's probably behind the seat.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.314
And did you notice that banner?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.609
It said, "Welcome Home
From Prison Again, Buster."

17:48.692 --> 17:51.945
I mean, it's like, did they expect me
to come home from prison?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.698
Yeah. I think they were just being ironic.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.158
- I mean, it's like a...
- Oh.

17:56.241 --> 17:57.951
A not-surprise party.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.371
Like if Buster was coming home,
he'd expect a surprise party,

18:01.455 --> 18:03.040
so it wouldn't be a surprise.
Since he's in jail,

18:03.123 --> 18:05.918
we're gonna throw a party and not tell
him since there won't be guests.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.212
- Yep.
- Well,

18:08.295 --> 18:10.631
I am surprised she went through
all that trouble.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.716
- Oh, so I guess it worked.
- Mm-hmm.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.927
But I hope this is okay for you.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.220
- Oh.
- 'Cause it might be

18:16.303 --> 18:17.846
a couple of months.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.933
Oh, we're not gonna be up here
for a couple of months.

18:21.016 --> 18:23.310
I mean, I can't do that.
I mean, that's... For me,

18:23.393 --> 18:26.021
- that's, uh, pretty scary.
- No.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.274
Because we're the Inside-Outside Bandits,

18:29.358 --> 18:33.362
and the only thing
that scares us is not being safe and cozy.

18:33.904 --> 18:36.073
A guy could have a mighty nice life
up here.

18:36.156 --> 18:40.744
Do you...
You want us to die here together?

18:42.496 --> 18:43.789
You're hungry.

18:43.872 --> 18:46.583
I'll go downstairs
and get us some food.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.753
- How does gummies sound?
- Necessary.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.755
I don't get it.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.343
<i>But the model house</i>
<i>had another visitor.</i>

18:59.304 --> 19:02.391
Good, Buster. I saw your truck.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.601
Glad you're here. Hey, uh...

19:05.561 --> 19:09.356
So I'm gonna kind of need your help

19:09.439 --> 19:12.276
with a little, uh, "magic trick" of sorts.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.777
So, favor.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.405
I cannot do you a favor, Gob.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.866
I am on the lam. I escaped from jail.

19:19.074 --> 19:22.077
Escaped. Yeah, I don't think so.

19:23.495 --> 19:24.830
- They released you, Buster.
- No.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.500
- Oscar freed me.
- I don't think so.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.211
Uh, I think I'd know if I wasn't
on the lam.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.755
I mean, unless he happened
to do that exactly

19:33.839 --> 19:35.632
when I was released,
so I thought I was running,

19:35.716 --> 19:37.718
- but... wasn't.
- Right.

19:37.801 --> 19:40.387
But that would also be
what exactly what happened, but...

19:40.470 --> 19:42.306
Yeah, but Oscar and I are living
in the attic.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.767
I mean, that's because I'm a wanted man.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.020
Impossible.
You weren't even a wanted child.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.522
<i>Which reminded Buster</i>
<i>of the poster</i>

19:50.606 --> 19:52.983
<i>he'd seen earlier that day at the mall,</i>

19:53.066 --> 19:55.694
<i>and which he now realized
had another meaning.</i>

19:55.777 --> 19:57.362
<i>So no one's out there looking</i>
<i>for me?</i>

19:57.613 --> 19:59.865
But if that's true, I guess technically

19:59.948 --> 20:01.825
now we don't have to live in the attic.

20:01.909 --> 20:05.245
So I'll just go back to living
with George Sr. as my father,

20:05.329 --> 20:08.749
and then Oscar can go back to his life
with... without me.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.418
Well, that's good news for him, huh?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.711
Please don't tell him.

20:13.378 --> 20:16.215
He's... He's in my life now,
and... and I know it's not honest,

20:16.298 --> 20:18.383
but I want to kind of keep that going
a bit longer.

20:21.094 --> 20:22.554
Your secret is safe with me, Buster.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.015
No strings attached.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.726
- Aw.
- If...

20:27.809 --> 20:31.772
you help me get rid of this big,
dead-body-shaped thing.

20:31.855 --> 20:33.815
- What is it?
- I just told you, it's...

20:33.899 --> 20:35.108
Mm.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.820
It's from a magician friend.
It was part of his big...

20:41.615 --> 20:44.534
his big final farewell disappearing act.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.163
Need I remind you, Buster,
that as my one-time assistant,

20:48.247 --> 20:51.333
you are still bound by the
magician's assistant oath.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.796
Mm. Say no more.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.969
- Bye, Oscar.
- I'm on the phone!

21:02.219 --> 21:04.554
<i>On the next </i> Arrested Development...

21:04.805 --> 21:09.101
<i>Gob makes good on his second obligation
to the Gay Mafia,</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:12.813
<i>by arriving
for heterosexual conversion therapy...</i>

21:12.896 --> 21:15.482
My name is Gob Bluth.
I'm here for a 12:30 un-gaying.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.567
<i>...determined to prove it doesn't work.</i>

21:17.651 --> 21:19.695
Hey, Gob. It's me, Ann's mother.

21:20.362 --> 21:21.363
Who?

21:21.446 --> 21:24.908
That's the one. So I just have
some papers for you to sign.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.536
Just some legalese stating that
if you kill yourself

21:27.619 --> 21:30.539
as a result of the therapy,
it's your fault, not ours.

21:31.331 --> 21:35.460
Yeah. Boy, wish I could pray
that sweater away.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.172
<i>Unfortunately for Gob...</i>

21:39.256 --> 21:41.883
- Uh-oh.
- <i>...it works a little too well.</i>

21:44.678 --> 21:47.472
<i>Oscar and Buster attempt
to keep each other in the dark...</i>

21:47.556 --> 21:49.224
We should keep an eye out
for cops.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.726
I'm watching out for cops.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.978
<i>...but can't resist a non-gummy dinner.</i>

21:53.061 --> 21:54.563
So where should we go out?

21:54.646 --> 21:57.566
- There's a Coco's by the beach.
- Oh...

21:57.649 --> 21:59.192
There's a Coco's in town.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.194
Let's do it.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.072
<i>Although Buster decides</i>
<i>to run an errand</i>

22:04.156 --> 22:05.532
<i>for his brother on the way.</i>

22:05.615 --> 22:07.659
Just dropping off something
for Gob.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.744
It'll take me a second!

22:10.996 --> 22:12.706
<i>But unfortunately for Buster...</i>

22:12.789 --> 22:16.543
Return from whence... you came.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.086
<i>...he does so from</i>

22:18.170 --> 22:20.547
<i>a long-thought-missing piece
of evidence.</i>

22:21.590 --> 22:25.302
Hey, the stairs on our getaway truck
are pretty sticky.

22:25.385 --> 22:28.680
I wonder if there's, like,
a really tall car wash around here.

22:29.473 --> 22:33.226
Oh, yeah. I... I noticed there's
a blood-like substance back there.

22:33.393 --> 22:36.313
But that's a tomorrow job.
That's for the daytime.
