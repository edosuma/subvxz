01:57.385 --> 01:59.687
One Month Earlier
Thank you so much.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.725
Sweet Dreams,
cookies and cream..

02:04.758 --> 02:07.895
or Perfect Day,
pralines and pistachio.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.698
Sweet Dreams.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.801
Hey. Oh!

02:13.834 --> 02:16.370
Got a little bit there.
It was pretty good though.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.907
Aw, look.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.875
Oh, buddy.
- Hey.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.453
'What happened?
You lose your ice cream?'

02:23.477 --> 02:24.588
Yeah, I was running with it.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.247
'Stupid.'

02:26.280 --> 02:28.316
Yeah, well..

02:28.349 --> 02:30.484
You want mine?
It's cookies and cream.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.486
Max, I told you

02:32.520 --> 02:35.289
not to run with
your ice cream, didn't I?

02:35.323 --> 02:37.525
She gave me
her cookies and cream.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.927
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm, I'm Summer.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.495
I just, I saw he dropped it

02:41.529 --> 02:42.463
and the ice cream
man's already probably gone.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.332
I haven't touched mine, so.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.742
'Thought he could
have it. I should have asked.'

02:45.766 --> 02:47.601
Alright, I guess it's fine.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.836
That's very kind of you.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.371
What do we say?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.872
Thank you, Summer.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.874
You're welcome.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.515
So..

03:04.385 --> 03:06.463
We must've been the only
ones without kids back there.

03:06.487 --> 03:09.390
Hm.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.500
We're gonna
need to get on that.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.992
Yeah?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.527
Yeah, I mean, it's..

03:13.561 --> 03:14.962
It's been nearly two years

03:14.995 --> 03:18.866
and we're not
getting any younger.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.801
Come on, you know
how bad I want kids

03:20.834 --> 03:25.239
but you don't even
know what kind of ring I want.

03:25.273 --> 03:28.742
But if by chance..

03:28.776 --> 03:30.878
I did..

03:30.911 --> 03:33.347
might it look
something like this?

03:36.417 --> 03:37.718
Oh, my gosh!

03:40.688 --> 03:43.291
Summer Pratt..

03:43.324 --> 03:45.626
Everyday with you
has been a perfect day.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.961
I... I, I wanted to marry you
since our first ice cream date.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.797
I just, I had to just

03:49.830 --> 03:51.799
save up for this.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.669
Will you marry me?

03:55.703 --> 03:56.937
Yes!

04:03.544 --> 04:05.446
Here, I'll put it on.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.567
What?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.578
Is that thing gonna get
more attention than me now?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.504
You shouldn't have
chosen so wisely.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.841
I did choose wisely.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.818
Hey, wait.
- What?

04:46.687 --> 04:47.855
Did you grab what you said

04:47.888 --> 04:49.757
you were gonna
pick up at the pharmacy?

04:49.790 --> 04:52.693
Um.. Whoops.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.096
I forgot.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.566
I was thinking

04:58.599 --> 05:00.934
maybe we just

05:00.968 --> 05:03.036
make a baby?

05:03.070 --> 05:06.907
No, I am not going
to be showing at our wedding.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.777
I'm okay with a little
"I'm traditional" here and there

05:09.810 --> 05:13.647
but I draw a line
on maternity gowns.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.715
Alright.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.818
Okay, then we'll just

05:17.851 --> 05:19.319
play it safe.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.996
Here you go.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.433
See you on Friday?
- Yeah.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.569
I love you, wifey.

05:35.603 --> 05:37.070
Yeah.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.107
I miss you already,
and I love you.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.609
Text me when you land.
- Yeah.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.943
Okay.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.074
Clint, do you hear that?

08:04.051 --> 08:05.619
Hey!
- Hi!

08:05.653 --> 08:08.121
Hey!
- Hello! Welcome.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.957
Oh, you must be Summer!

08:09.990 --> 08:13.861
Uh, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

08:13.894 --> 08:17.264
Summer, this is my boss
Travis Walsh and his wife Lily.

08:17.297 --> 08:20.100
Such a pleasure.
- Won't you come in?

08:24.738 --> 08:26.840
Surprise!

08:26.874 --> 08:28.876
'Surprise!'

08:28.909 --> 08:30.243
Oh, my gosh!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.780
It's our engagement party.
- What?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.181
Now, you guys need drinks

08:34.214 --> 08:37.183
and we need music, yeah?

08:39.653 --> 08:41.054
Hi, Summer, surprise.
- Hi.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.256
Oh, hi.
- You guys really got me.

08:43.289 --> 08:44.730
Hey, congratulations.
- Hi, Monica.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.595
Okay, where are all the cars?
- Valet.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.639
We couldn't have you
guessing we were up to no good.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.663
Oh.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.002
Wow.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.276
Not one single guy, not one.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.878
Hey, congrats.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.152
I'm so happy for you and Clint.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.615
Thank you, thank you.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.029
How many of these
people do you even know?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.755
No one.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.057
He has only been
in the company for a month.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.359
You know, apparently
the Walshes know some

09:19.392 --> 09:21.929
very important politicians.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.697
Oh, hopefully you won't have to

09:23.731 --> 09:24.698
invite them all to your wedding.

09:24.732 --> 09:25.799
Oh, my gosh.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
Have you guys picked a date yet?

09:27.400 --> 09:30.370
Oh, we're still trying
to figure out a schedule.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.773
It's really tough,
at least until summer.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.742
He's in Sacramento every week.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.746
Aw! Summer's summer
wedding. - I swear!

09:38.779 --> 09:40.323
If they really love him,
they can figure out a way

09:40.347 --> 09:41.715
to keep him down here.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.617
Yeah, right?
Travis's office is here.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.620
So, I guess we'll look into it.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.022
But, um, I don't know,
Clint doesn't wanna push it.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.793
He just got a big bonus,
and then this obviously.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.728
Where do you think
all their money comes from?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.029
I mean, they're really young

09:56.063 --> 09:57.931
and this is a super nice house.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.733
'I can't afford
a house like this in LA'

09:59.767 --> 10:00.810
'even on a physician salary.'

10:00.834 --> 10:01.969
Oh, I don't know.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.171
Maybe they come from money.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.773
No, not her.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.808
You see the way
she carries herself?

10:07.841 --> 10:09.977
That's rehearsed.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.712
Okay, well,
maybe she married into it.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.956
It's his family's money
or something, I don't know.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.982
Why do you care?
- Well, I... I don't know.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.884
I just, you know, your fiance

10:16.917 --> 10:18.385
is lobbying for their interest.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.288
Don't you care
what their interests are?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.390
You watch too many crime dramas.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.936
Oh, ladies! More champagne?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.006
Oh, I wish. Looks like Clint's
already three Scotches in.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.708
Somebody's gotta get us
home in one piece.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.375
Oh, boo.
- Two is my limit.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.177
I have to work in the morning.

10:44.211 --> 10:45.713
Fine, fine, fine.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.314
Can I interest
you in an espresso

10:47.347 --> 10:49.282
or a cappuccino perhaps?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.152
Oh, that would be awesome.
- Okay, great.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.355
Hey, Clint didn't tell me
you have a daughter.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.124
I'm sorry?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.892
Uh, I just saw a little girl

10:58.926 --> 11:00.427
out there in window.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.765
Oh, that, yes,
that's our little angel Sophie.

11:04.798 --> 11:08.201
She's ten, and she's not
supposed to be awake.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.037
Oh, that's too bad,
she's so cute.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.247
It would've been nice
to have met her.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.041
Hmm, I'm sure someday you will.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.043
You have a child,
and you look like this?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.210
Aw, thanks.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.946
It was not easy coming back.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.147
Let me tell you.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.785
Oh, well, Summer..

11:24.818 --> 11:26.253
Summer can't wait to have kids.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.858
I work with them 24/7, so I can.

11:30.891 --> 11:34.127
What do you with kids?
- I'm a pediatrician.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.230
You are? Oh, that's wonderful.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.808
Sophie could use one,
and it would be great

11:38.832 --> 11:40.333
to have someone we already know.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.102
You don't already have one?

11:42.135 --> 11:45.238
Uh, her last pediatrician
went to New York, so.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.974
I would love to get your card.
- Sure.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.017
There's just so few people

11:48.041 --> 11:49.810
you can trust with your kid.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.381
Are you okay?
- Yeah, um..

11:54.414 --> 11:56.750
It's the champagne. Do you have
a restroom that I can use?

12:06.927 --> 12:07.928
Oh.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.100
There she is!

12:13.133 --> 12:15.435
So, Monica tells me
you're a decorator?

12:15.468 --> 12:16.870
I have a sitting room

12:16.904 --> 12:18.839
that could totally
use your talent.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.817
Yeah, well, we should talk
about that. I'd love that.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.143
Oh, that'd be great.
- Yeah.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.912
Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.379
Hey, you feeling alright?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.915
No, actually I'm not.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.351
Uh-oh, too much champagne?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.053
No, um..

12:33.086 --> 12:35.455
I just, I don't know.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.224
I think I should just lay down.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.227
No, is there anything
we can do for you?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.330
I have painkillers,
anything you like.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.398
Maybe we should just
call it a night.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.001
Yeah, um, I'm so sorry,
thank you guys so much.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.803
You guys are so..

12:49.837 --> 12:51.571
This was lovely, thank you.

12:51.604 --> 12:56.109
Let us show you out.
- Oh, thank you.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.410
Painkillers?
- What?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.847
I was just showing
them hospitality.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.171
Clint!

13:24.204 --> 13:25.505
Clint!

13:28.108 --> 13:30.810
Y-yeah, tell them
to call me back.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.261
So what did Dr. Monahan say?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.331
He said the miscarriage was
due to low progesterone levels.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.633
I didn't even know
I was five weeks pregnant.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.335
How does that happen?

13:55.368 --> 13:58.638
These things happen
more than you know.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.516
Look, after your wedding,
you guys can try again.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.176
I have something called
polycystic kidney.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.880
That's why I miscarried.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.349
It means that I may never
be able to have kids, right?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.294
I've read about that,
and that's what it says, Monica.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.096
You know, Summer, just because
you have a hormonal imbalance

14:13.120 --> 14:15.055
doesn't mean
you can't have kids.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.526
But there's a chance
that it can mean that, right?

14:19.559 --> 14:21.895
I mean,
they have meds you can take

14:21.929 --> 14:24.264
when you're ready.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.599
What if they don't work?
What if I can't?

14:26.633 --> 14:29.036
Well, then you have
plenty of other options.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.505
I could steal one for you.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.911
You're gonna be a great mom

14:37.945 --> 14:39.212
you know that?

15:03.270 --> 15:05.138
Can I get you anything?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.478
No.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.214
I'm okay.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.383
Hey, come here.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.528
Hey.
- Hm.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.065
We're gonna get through this.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.244
But I'm not pregnant anymore.

16:51.278 --> 16:53.380
So why, why would I be
having dreams that I am?

16:53.413 --> 16:56.583
I think your dream is more about

16:56.616 --> 16:58.118
you not being able
to reach yourself

16:58.151 --> 16:59.719
on the other side.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.621
It makes sense to me.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.490
It's your feelings
about the miscarriage.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.292
Yeah, maybe.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.028
Maybe it's my subconscious
telling me how it is.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.732
Having nightmares
after a miscarriage..

17:12.765 --> 17:15.167
I mean, even during a pregnancy,
that's totally normal.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.403
Yeah?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.540
Thank you.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.376
Hi, Ness.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.311
Gonna be meeting crazy kids.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.314
How's it comin' up?
- 'Oh, you have no idea.'

17:27.347 --> 17:28.581
'Summer?'

17:28.615 --> 17:30.217
Lily, hi.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.619
Oh, my God, it's so nice
to see you again.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.221
Muah, muah.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.755
And, Monica.
- Hello.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.390
Muah, muah!

17:37.424 --> 17:39.859
Or should I say "Dr. Thorne?"
- Oh.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.429
'And this must be..'

17:42.462 --> 17:44.331
Oh, Sophie, my daughter.
- Sophie.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.367
Our daughter, Sophie.
- Hi. How are you?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.436
Oh!
- Oh, Jesus.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.740
Sorry.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.280
You like crossword
puzzles too, huh?

18:01.881 --> 18:04.151
Thank you.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.253
How'd that happen
to your hand, little lady?

18:06.286 --> 18:07.696
'Oh, that's actually
why we're here.'

18:07.720 --> 18:09.256
She has a nasty little cut

18:09.289 --> 18:11.224
and I was hoping
you could take a look.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.326
Yeah, sure. Come
on back. - Great.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.637
I'm gonna get out of
here. I'll see you guys later.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.364
Nice to meet you.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
Why don't you just
stay for a bit?

18:18.798 --> 18:21.701
I think Sophie likes you.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.836
Okay.
- Hmm, come on.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.340
Come.
- How did this happen?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.576
It was a steak knife, I think.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.145
She was helping me
with the dishes, and she just..

18:32.179 --> 18:33.789
shoved her hands,
right into the soapsuds.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.315
Ouch.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.185
You are a trooper.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.253
'Doesn't this hurt?'

18:40.287 --> 18:42.255
'Oh, come on.'

18:42.289 --> 18:43.656
She's a warrior, right?

18:43.690 --> 18:46.159
Aren't you, Sophie?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.727
This room is just adorable.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.928
Did you do this yourself?

18:48.961 --> 18:50.697
No, this is all Summer.

18:50.730 --> 18:53.500
'I knew it.
I knew you were good.'

18:53.533 --> 18:55.378
You know, offer still
stands in the sitting room.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.304
Oh, thank you. Okay.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.844
Thank you so much, Monica.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.255
It's nice to know next
time if Sophie gets sick

19:06.279 --> 19:07.780
we know just where to come.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.283
Yeah, and if you wanna
have her medical records

19:10.317 --> 19:12.352
faxed over from the old place

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
just let us know,
we'll give 'em a call.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.289
Right.
Yes, of course.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.591
I'll try to remember to do that.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.460
'Um, and, I'll
send the intern's info.'

19:20.493 --> 19:21.828
Mm-hmm.

19:21.861 --> 19:22.829
'Or you can just
bill us directly.'

19:22.862 --> 19:25.232
Okay.
- Okay!

19:25.265 --> 19:26.866
Alright, um, Soph..

19:26.899 --> 19:28.701
Let's get outta here. Heh heh.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.372
Oh, uh, Lily.
- Hmm?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.507
When would you
like me to come by?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.584
How about tomorrow?
- 'Okay.'

19:35.608 --> 19:37.377
Okay.
- 'Bye, Sophie.'

19:40.480 --> 19:41.814
Okay. See you.

20:02.469 --> 20:03.703
Hello. Oh.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.706
Hello?

20:08.941 --> 20:10.410
Hello?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.613
Hello?

20:18.551 --> 20:19.719
Lily?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.397
Lily?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.294
Oh! My God!

21:01.328 --> 21:03.496
Oh, Sophie.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.697
Oh, you scared me.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.566
Sophie?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.967
What did you do?
- No, nothing.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.769
It's fine, I was just,
I was, uh..

21:09.802 --> 21:11.638
I just saw this over here.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.673
Oh, geez, I'm so sorry.

21:13.706 --> 21:16.576
Those are Sophie's sheets from
yesterday when she cut herself.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.579
Um, honey, I told you
to put these in the hamper.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.748
Is kitchen floor
the hamper, huh?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.553
'She has this weird thing'

21:26.586 --> 21:28.488
where she keeps
coming into the kitchen.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.789
No idea why.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.896
So, my husband tells
me I have terrible taste.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.065
Tell me, what inspires you?

21:39.098 --> 21:41.634
Well, I can storyboard some
ideas from you and start there.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.679
You mind if I take some
photos and measurements first?

21:43.703 --> 21:45.338
By all means.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.773
Oh, excuse me.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.043
It's Travis.
Excuse me. - Okay.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.513
Hi, honey.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.520
Oh!

22:00.553 --> 22:02.589
Hey, Sophie.

22:02.622 --> 22:05.358
You wanna give me a
hand? I could use some help.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.496
Here. Take this.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.030
On to the edge of the wall.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.867
Mmm.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.068
Eight-O-One, perfect.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.705
Just let go.
It rolls up back on.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.440
Awesome, thank you.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.376
Ugh!

22:23.410 --> 22:25.044
Sophie here decided to help me.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.879
Oh, how cute.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.782
Hey, I feel awful for
asking, but our nanny quit

22:29.816 --> 22:31.451
unexpectedly last week, and..

22:31.484 --> 22:33.028
we've been trying
to find a replacement.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.887
But with everything
happening at the company

22:34.921 --> 22:36.432
I've been helping out
with consulting, so it's just...

22:36.456 --> 22:39.058
Yeah, I can, I can
watch Sophie today.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.536
With all you guys have
done, it's the least I could do.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.961
Seriously?
- Yeah.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.030
Ah, thank you. Are you sure?
- Yeah.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.832
Provided it's okay with..

22:48.601 --> 22:50.136
Ah! She's just shy.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.472
But I can tell she likes you.

22:52.505 --> 22:56.743
And between you and me,
she doesn't really like people.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.479
Yeah.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.556
Can I show you
around, quick? - Okay.

23:00.580 --> 23:01.580
Okay.
- Yeah.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.853
So, this here is Travis' study.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.689
We have a guest room,
and the bathroom right here.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.425
And, then, at the
end of the hallway is..

23:12.459 --> 23:13.660
Sophie's room.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.628
Okay, cool.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.570
Oh, so, she'll probably
keep to herself in her room

23:23.603 --> 23:25.914
the whole time, but if she
gives you any trouble, you'll call me?

23:25.938 --> 23:27.540
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
we'll be fine.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.442
She seems so sweet.
- Yeah.

23:29.476 --> 23:32.178
Yeah, she's, uh, special.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.146
Anyway, text me if you
have any problems, okay?

23:34.180 --> 23:35.515
Muah, muah!

23:35.548 --> 23:36.916
Thank you.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.795
'I said her name is Summer.'

23:48.828 --> 23:51.998
'But why is she here?'

23:52.031 --> 23:54.667
'I think she's
gonna be our new nanny.'

23:54.701 --> 23:56.202
'She seems nice.'

23:58.037 --> 24:00.206
'What makes you
think they can trust her?'

24:00.239 --> 24:02.675
'She could be
just like the others.'

24:16.188 --> 24:18.591
Who were you just talking to?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.527
You got a friend over?

24:21.260 --> 24:23.896
Huh! I see.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.032
We're playing hide and seek?

24:26.065 --> 24:28.167
Bet you I know
where I can find her.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.642
Boo!

24:42.882 --> 24:44.751
Oh, where did she sneak out?

24:46.118 --> 24:47.920
Go out over here.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.125
Sasha's shy.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.961
She doesn't trust you.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.262
Sasha, huh?

24:58.097 --> 25:00.533
Um, and what about you?

25:00.567 --> 25:02.068
You trust me?

25:16.616 --> 25:19.919
Um, isn't it kind of cool that
we like the same kind of pizza?

25:23.923 --> 25:25.858
So, tell me..

25:25.892 --> 25:27.994
Why did your last nanny..

25:28.027 --> 25:30.096
quit so last minute?

25:30.129 --> 25:32.999
I don't know.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.235
She just disappeared.

25:36.268 --> 25:41.107
Disappeared? What do
you mean, like, like she moved?

25:41.140 --> 25:43.576
I think she was afraid.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.944
Afraid of what?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.882
Hi, Summer. How're
you doing? - Good.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.818
Ooh! Did you guys get pizza?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.720
Mm-hmm.
- Yummy!

25:53.753 --> 25:55.297
But I bet it's about time
for you to brush your teeth

25:55.321 --> 25:57.156
and get ready
for bed now, huh?

25:57.990 --> 25:59.859
Go ahead.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.828
Oh, wait a second.
Uh-uh-uh.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.768
There you go.
- Thank you.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.302
Oh, wait, Soph.

26:10.336 --> 26:12.038
Don't forget your milk.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.239
'Goodnight, sweetie.'

26:13.272 --> 26:14.316
You wanna say
"Thank you, Summer"

26:14.340 --> 26:16.609
for the pizza and watching you?

26:16.643 --> 26:18.110
Thank you, Summer.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.116
Did you, did you want a
drink? - Oh, no. Thank you.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.052
I'm gonna head
home soon and call Clint.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.021
So, how did it go today?

26:29.055 --> 26:30.823
It was good.

26:30.857 --> 26:33.025
Sophie is very well-behaved.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.763
Uh, most of the afternoon,
she didn't make a peep

26:36.796 --> 26:41.300
but, uh, I... I went
down her room once and..

26:41.333 --> 26:43.069
does, does Sophie

26:43.102 --> 26:46.706
have any friends that
she has over sometimes?

26:46.739 --> 26:50.342
Oh, oh, well, Sophie
just talks to herself a lot.

26:50.376 --> 26:54.380
Yeah, she has these, um, oh,
I don't know, imaginary friends

26:54.413 --> 26:55.982
that she talks to.

26:56.015 --> 26:57.650
'I know, it seems weird.'

26:57.684 --> 27:00.286
No. I... I don't
think it's weird at all.

27:00.319 --> 27:03.422
See, she takes these pills,
uh, otherwise she gets these

27:03.455 --> 27:06.693
horrible night terrors.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.160
Heavens knows why though.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.296
She has everything
she could ever want.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.798
Right here with us.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.134
Right, honey?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.303
Hm?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.686
I'm going for a swim.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.421
You know, you really
shouldn't be letting

27:35.454 --> 27:38.691
my newest head of government
affair's fiance look after her.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.160
We agreed to keep her
scarce around the business.

27:41.193 --> 27:44.931
Don't you mean "Our newest
head of government affairs?"

27:44.964 --> 27:46.933
Our company, right?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.212
You wanna play
that game again?

27:50.236 --> 27:51.237
Maybe.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.781
What's mine is
yours and yours is mine.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.682
Isn't that the agreement?

28:24.303 --> 28:26.072
Now you're the new nanny?

28:26.105 --> 28:29.308
Yeah. I... I guess so. I..

28:29.341 --> 28:31.978
She kind of cornered me in the
driveway and asked for my help

28:32.011 --> 28:33.312
on re-designing
the sitting room.

28:33.345 --> 28:35.081
So, it won't be for long.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.192
Just until she can find
someone else to hire, you know?

28:37.216 --> 28:39.051
What is Lily so busy with?

28:39.085 --> 28:42.221
I don't know. Travis needs
help, she sounded desperate.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.190
Desperate to go
the gym or shopping?

28:44.223 --> 28:47.026
Baby, Lily is not even
an employee of the company.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.761
You do not have to do this.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.397
You can just tell 'em
"No." They'll understand.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.365
'Look, I'll... I'll talk
to Travis tomorrow.'

28:53.399 --> 28:56.502
'You'll feel comfortable.'
- No. No, it's fine. Really.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.771
Maybe, maybe this will
be good for me, you know?

28:58.805 --> 29:02.474
Sweetheart, you, you're an
interior designer, a good one.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.443
Not a nanny.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.512
Yeah, well, and right
now it just so happens to be

29:06.545 --> 29:10.116
I could be a nanny getting
paid an interior designer's salary.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.918
'Really?'
- Yes.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.953
'Well, alright,
then, well, they..'

29:13.986 --> 29:14.954
'They must actually
be desperate then?'

29:14.987 --> 29:16.488
Maybe.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.933
'Probably to find
someone that they trust'

29:17.957 --> 29:20.259
around all their expensive crap.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.329
But, listen, I'm... I'm
serious about what I said, okay?

29:23.362 --> 29:25.064
You do not have to
do this just because

29:25.097 --> 29:27.133
they own the
company that I work for?

29:27.166 --> 29:29.111
If it's not working out for
any reason, you promise me

29:29.135 --> 29:30.369
you let me know, okay?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.138
It's fine. I'm fine, really.

29:32.171 --> 29:35.041
Stop lobbying to me, okay?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.143
I'm tougher than I look.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.852
I like being here with
you better than the park.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.421
Well, so do I.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.025
But, you know, you
need some friends your age.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.402
'You can't only be
friends with the big kids'

29:54.426 --> 29:56.595
like me, your mom and dad.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.231
They aren't my friends.

29:59.265 --> 30:01.000
Those people hate me.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.870
What?

30:03.903 --> 30:06.338
They're your parents.
Of course, they don't hate you.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.340
I wish I wasn't here.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.845
I've heard them
talking about it lots of times.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.813
'They thought I was asleep.'

30:17.383 --> 30:21.353
Daddy said that
I was a burden.

30:21.387 --> 30:24.090
A nuisance to their new lives.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.358
New life? What does that mean?

30:28.027 --> 30:29.962
I'm not allowed to say.

30:31.898 --> 30:36.068
Mommy said if I told,
I could die.

30:43.109 --> 30:46.879
Well, I'm sure
you read them wrong.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.181
And that is something that
you do not need to worry about

30:49.215 --> 30:52.584
for a very long time, okay?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.013
Are we playing hide and seek?

31:32.424 --> 31:36.062
I wonder where Sophie could be?

31:38.164 --> 31:44.603
Could she be... in here?

31:45.972 --> 31:47.206
Huh.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.956
Gosh.
- Heh heh.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.424
Oh, you got me.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.526
Get in there.
- Heh. Huh!

32:10.162 --> 32:14.066
Might want the
sheets, huh? Feeling hot?

32:14.100 --> 32:15.367
Phew!
- Heh.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.568
Phew!

32:19.138 --> 32:21.540
Ah! I am so sorry we're late.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.375
These silly things
always run a way later

32:23.409 --> 32:25.077
than they're supposed to.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.713
Wild clients keep
things running, I get it.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.083
Yet these development
companies making millions on their own

32:31.117 --> 32:33.452
still expect to
be wined and dined.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.554
So, how was your day?

32:35.587 --> 32:38.757
Ah, yeah, it was good, um,
Sophie and I went to the park

32:38.790 --> 32:41.127
and then we got ice cream.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.062
Oh, um, the park.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.632
Uh, did we ever talk
about taking her to the park?

32:46.665 --> 32:49.368
Oh, oh, no, I'm sorry. I..

32:49.401 --> 32:51.513
You know, I actually texted
you, and I never heard back

32:51.537 --> 32:53.739
so I guess I just assumed,
which I shouldn't have done.

32:53.772 --> 32:56.042
It's not..
I'm really sorry, I...

32:56.075 --> 32:58.177
She's not
supposed to be outside.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.480
She, um, she
has a skin condition.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.150
It's very dangerous
for her to be in sunlight

33:04.183 --> 33:05.784
for long periods of time.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.319
It's why she
wears a long sleeve.

33:07.353 --> 33:09.255
She's just really fragile.

33:09.288 --> 33:13.459
I'm so sorry, I, I would've
never taken her, I understand.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.494
Thank you.

33:15.527 --> 33:19.265
Hey, so..

33:19.298 --> 33:23.269
Does Sophie kind of
have a wild imagination?

33:24.603 --> 33:26.405
Mm. Why do you ask?

33:26.438 --> 33:29.775
Uh, she was just kind of
saying strange things today, so.

33:29.808 --> 33:32.144
Like what?

33:32.178 --> 33:36.082
Um, you know, I..

33:36.115 --> 33:38.650
She thinks she overheard
you guys saying things about her

33:38.684 --> 33:42.288
like, that you guys
don't want her around.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.656
I'm sorry, I know this is
really, probably even more

33:44.690 --> 33:46.258
uncomfortable for
you than it is for me

33:46.292 --> 33:48.794
even asking this,
but is this something

33:48.827 --> 33:51.163
that she's expressed
before to you guys or..

33:53.732 --> 33:56.102
Wow!

33:56.135 --> 33:59.605
She's on that one
again, huh? - Excuse me?

33:59.638 --> 34:02.308
Um, her, her last
psychiatrist seemed to think that

34:02.341 --> 34:04.576
the whole thing was just, uh..

34:04.610 --> 34:07.746
An elaborate cry for attention.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.681
She's spoiled.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.650
Lily spoils her way too much.

34:11.683 --> 34:15.221
I do. Heh heh. I do.

34:15.254 --> 34:16.563
I don't know, I
guess I was just hoping

34:16.588 --> 34:18.257
she stops saying these things.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.759
I mean, how do you
think we feel?

34:20.792 --> 34:22.793
Parents whose daughter
goes around talking about

34:22.828 --> 34:25.630
how awful they are.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.266
Not exactly the best
subject to dinner parties.

34:29.900 --> 34:33.105
Wow, yeah, well,
that's, that's really tough.

34:33.139 --> 34:36.408
It's just another reason why
it's so hard to take her places.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.277
But I'm so sorry
you had to deal with that.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.179
I hope you don't
think ill towards us now.

34:41.213 --> 34:44.250
Especially because,
well, we think so highly

34:44.283 --> 34:46.185
of you and Clint.

34:46.217 --> 34:49.388
You know, he's the best
lobbyist I've ever worked with.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.257
You guys have been
nothing but amazing.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.661
Even I had a wild
imagination as a kid, so.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.563
I just thought you
guys should know.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.798
Aw.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.676
We really appreciate
you keeping us in the loop.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.702
Yeah.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.975
You've just been such a
great help with Sophie this week.

35:08.207 --> 35:10.442
Really, it means the world
to us to have someone

35:10.476 --> 35:15.281
so protective look
over our daughter.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.815
Well, I should get home. Um..

35:16.848 --> 35:18.417
Clint's coming
home tomorrow, so.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.287
Oh, you, you haven't
spoken to him, have you?

35:21.320 --> 35:23.755
You should
probably give him a call.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.425
We're just so close
to closing with these guys

35:26.458 --> 35:30.329
I asked him to extend his
trip for just a little bit longer.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.631
I hope that's okay.
- Yeah.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.533
Yeah, of course, it's fine.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.603
Cheers.
- Cheers!

35:40.239 --> 35:41.240
Whoo!

35:45.244 --> 35:46.754
'I don't care what
anyone else says. Ha.

35:46.778 --> 35:48.447
'I make the
rules in this house.'

35:48.480 --> 35:49.848
'And if I say to stay here'

35:49.881 --> 35:51.750
'you sure as hell better stay!'

35:58.690 --> 36:00.526
She just stares,
she doesn't say anything.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.828
It's like talking to a ghost.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.397
Honey, maybe we should
take her to see a psychiatrist.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.333
Do you think?
- Yeah.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.668
Because that wouldn't be
humiliating for the both of us.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.972
Babe, we don't
need anyone telling us

36:14.005 --> 36:16.542
what we already
know about her. I gotta go.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.976
Meet you later at the course.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.811
Honey, I think this is...
- I gotta go.

36:27.819 --> 36:31.857
Sweetie, I just
really think that..

36:31.890 --> 36:34.860
Good morning, Summer.
- 'Good morning.'

36:34.893 --> 36:37.863
You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.899
I just sometimes get this
itchy eye thing in the morning.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.009
Is it Sophie?

36:51.042 --> 36:52.411
Listen, what I said last night

36:52.444 --> 36:55.947
Travis was really upset.

36:55.981 --> 36:59.818
No, it's just... sometimes..

36:59.851 --> 37:01.629
I... I don't think
I'm cut out to be a mother.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.955
No.

37:03.989 --> 37:06.825
No. Okay, I can't tell you
much about being a parent.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.794
Mine weren't really
around when I was a kid

37:08.827 --> 37:13.532
but... it was hard, my
parents were traveling doctors.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.402
I know they felt terrible,
but there was nothing

37:16.435 --> 37:18.804
they could really
do about it, you know?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.939
Yeah.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.874
Where are they now?

37:22.908 --> 37:26.812
Um, my parents
actually passed away.

37:26.845 --> 37:30.282
Yeah, they died in a
plane crash when I was 17.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.950
Oh.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.419
And, uh..

37:35.921 --> 37:39.358
Actually a couple of weeks
ago, I miscarried my first baby.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.493
Oh, my God!

37:41.527 --> 37:42.961
Summer.

37:42.994 --> 37:46.398
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.476
It's, uh.. Sorry, I didn't
mean to bring this up right now.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.571
I'm just, um, you know..

37:52.604 --> 37:55.907
Your, your time
with your kid is precious.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.077
You're really
lucky to have her.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.747
Sophie just probably wants
you guys around more, that's all.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.351
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.085
But it's just,
everything's been so busy.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.322
And both of us really want..

38:10.356 --> 38:11.990
Ugh, my God.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.360
Look at the time.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.695
I have so many calls
to make before I leave.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.831
Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.369
Okay. Okay.

38:27.739 --> 38:31.109
'She's not our friend.
She's ratted it on you'

38:31.142 --> 38:34.112
'and told them everything.'

38:34.145 --> 38:39.518
'I know, Sasha, she
doesn't know everything.'

38:39.551 --> 38:43.422
'Maybe we should have
told her what they did with you.'

38:43.455 --> 38:47.493
You heard what she said,
if anyone ever finds out

38:47.526 --> 38:49.928
we could both die.

38:49.961 --> 38:51.830
I made you breakfast, Sophie.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.934
Are you hungry?

38:55.967 --> 39:00.706
I made a scrambled
egg, and toast with jam.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.709
Sophie, look at me.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.446
Sasha isn't real, is she?

39:10.081 --> 39:11.917
Is she your imaginary friend?

39:14.686 --> 39:17.423
You know, I had one
when I was little too.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.795
Hey.

39:23.829 --> 39:27.833
Hey, you can trust me.

39:27.866 --> 39:31.937
Okay? - You told
them what I said.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.005
Why did you do that?

39:34.039 --> 39:37.476
Hmm, because I wanted
to know why they would

39:37.509 --> 39:39.745
say something like that.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.047
I didn't make something up.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.916
And Sasha?

39:44.950 --> 39:46.818
You didn't make her up either?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.690
That is Sasha.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.959
And that's mommy,
and that's daddy.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.694
I didn't make her up.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.196
Okay, why do mommy and
daddy want to hurt her? Hm?

39:58.229 --> 40:02.534
They don't like her?
- No one does.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.103
What about you?

40:05.136 --> 40:07.539
I like Sophie better.

40:07.573 --> 40:11.643
Well, I think Sophie
and Sasha are pretty cool.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.882
Do you want some
milk with your breakfast?

40:16.915 --> 40:18.884
Chocolate milk?

40:18.917 --> 40:21.953
Only if you forgive
me for telling, yes.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.857
'Okay, I'm leaving.'

40:25.891 --> 40:27.793
We have that publicity
event tonight at Marigon

40:27.826 --> 40:29.495
so we'll be back late.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.996
Can I get a hug?

40:33.732 --> 40:36.768
Sophie, what is that?

40:36.802 --> 40:39.437
Can I see? Come on.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.848
Summer, can you
give us a moment?

40:49.881 --> 40:52.584
Yeah, I was just...
- 'Just a moment.'

40:52.618 --> 40:53.952
Okay.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.206
This drawing isn't us,
do you understand?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.008
I don't really
know what to think.

41:17.042 --> 41:20.879
Look, Summer, the truth is..

41:20.912 --> 41:24.916
Sophie has a borderline
personality disorder.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.553
We didn't mention anything
before because of the businesses

41:27.586 --> 41:30.088
and the type of people
that we're always around.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.559
He's embarrassed
by her, isn't he?

41:33.592 --> 41:37.262
You know that little girl
she mentioned to you? Sasha?

41:37.295 --> 41:39.765
She isn't real.

41:39.798 --> 41:42.133
That manifestation
is part of the problem.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.736
We've tried to get her
help, we've tried to fix her

41:44.770 --> 41:47.706
but it just keeps
coming back to haunt us.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.575
Well, what does
she think you guys did?

41:49.608 --> 41:51.309
I don't know, she
thinks we're dangerous

41:51.342 --> 41:53.311
or we're out to
get her, I have no idea.

41:53.344 --> 41:57.148
Well, maybe, maybe she
senses her father's disconnect

41:57.182 --> 41:59.217
and thinks that you're
trying to take his side.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.721
I don't know,
you might be right.

42:02.754 --> 42:06.057
Travis never wanted
kids, and Sophie is a struggle.

42:08.193 --> 42:11.262
The truth is she
frightens me sometimes.

42:11.296 --> 42:16.201
She has this
twisted little imagination.

42:16.234 --> 42:19.738
That's the reason our
last nanny, Theresa quit.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.248
I was hoping things
would be different with you

42:21.272 --> 42:23.709
but now I just don't
think it was such a good idea.

42:23.742 --> 42:28.914
No, no, please, let me spend
some more time with her, okay?

42:28.947 --> 42:30.782
Maybe I can get
her out of her shell.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.019
Thank you, Summer.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.755
That'd be really great.

42:36.788 --> 42:39.057
Bye.
- Bye. See you.

42:47.165 --> 42:49.100
I see you found your milk.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.236
She was lying.

42:51.269 --> 42:53.605
About what?

42:53.639 --> 42:55.106
Everything.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.714
Can we do
crossword puzzles now?

43:02.748 --> 43:03.982
Okay.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.922
Hey, there's a little
bit of sun out here.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.924
Are you sure you're alright?

43:12.958 --> 43:15.360
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

43:15.393 --> 43:18.664
Oh, I thought you have
a skin allergy to the sun.

43:20.098 --> 43:21.299
Nope.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.803
Okay.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.738
Six-letter word.

43:26.772 --> 43:29.941
Skeletons in the..

43:29.975 --> 43:33.645
Well, can't be
"Graveyard." That's nine.

43:33.679 --> 43:37.215
"Closet."
Skeleton in the closet.

43:37.248 --> 43:39.017
What does that mean?

43:39.050 --> 43:42.253
It means
when someone has secrets

43:42.287 --> 43:45.724
but they don't want
anyone to find out about them.

43:45.757 --> 43:49.227
So, it's like they hide a part
of themselves in the closet.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.697
Hence the word "Skeleton."

43:53.464 --> 43:56.001
Hm, interesting.

43:56.034 --> 44:01.973
C-L-O-S-E-T.

44:12.918 --> 44:14.452
Mm, that's amazing.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.789
Sophie, you got to try this.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.292
It was just to cut the salad.

44:24.362 --> 44:26.464
You're afraid of
me too, aren't you?

44:26.497 --> 44:30.235
No, no, I'm not.
Give me that.

44:30.268 --> 44:32.137
It's a little too
close for comfort, okay?

45:30.395 --> 45:32.030
How did you get in here?

45:32.063 --> 45:35.433
Oh. Uh, Lily unlocked
it for me this morning.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.535
I, uh, I had to print
all these designs out

45:37.568 --> 45:40.939
but I couldn't do it
until Sophie was in bed, so.

45:40.972 --> 45:44.275
I'll be out in just a
second, I'm just finishing up.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.912
It's fine.

45:46.945 --> 45:48.814
I'm gonna go for a swim.

46:08.867 --> 46:10.768
Hey!
- Hey.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.973
Where's Lily? - Your
guess is as good as mine.

46:15.006 --> 46:16.050
I thought you guys
were supposed to be

46:16.074 --> 46:17.351
at that publicity thing tonight.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.444
Yeah, and I
guess she stayed after

46:19.477 --> 46:21.379
with some of girls..

46:21.412 --> 46:23.882
or boys, whatever.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.851
You wanna come in for a dip?

46:27.218 --> 46:29.254
I'm sure that Lily has an extra

46:29.287 --> 46:31.857
bikini you could borrow..

46:31.890 --> 46:34.259
if you need one.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.594
No, thank you.

46:36.627 --> 46:39.965
I'm gonna head home,
I'm a little behind this week

46:39.998 --> 46:42.067
from watching your daughter

46:42.100 --> 46:44.002
who's in that room, right there.

46:45.937 --> 46:49.007
You're a good girl,
aren't you, Summer Pratt?

46:51.109 --> 46:53.244
Maybe a nightcap
will change your mind.

47:16.467 --> 47:18.169
Uh, Theresa Salazar?

47:19.270 --> 47:21.907
Tia Theresa!

47:21.940 --> 47:23.875
Somebody here to see you.

47:29.580 --> 47:32.150
Hi.
- Hi, how can I help you?

47:32.183 --> 47:35.120
Uh, my name is Summer Pratt.
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

47:35.153 --> 47:36.955
I'm just, I was wondering

47:36.988 --> 47:39.224
if you had a minute to talk?

47:39.257 --> 47:41.626
Well, wh-what's this regarding?

47:41.659 --> 47:45.463
Uh, the girl that you
were watching, Sophie Walsh.

47:45.496 --> 47:47.432
What about her?
Did something happen to her?

47:47.465 --> 47:51.202
No, no, she's fine.
Um, she's fine.

47:51.236 --> 47:53.304
I'm... I'm the new nanny, so.

47:53.338 --> 47:54.973
I heard that you quit.

47:55.006 --> 47:57.909
I, I really had no choice.

47:57.943 --> 48:01.379
Mr. Walsh didn't
like me asking questions.

48:02.981 --> 48:05.650
Uh, may I ask
you what happened?

48:05.683 --> 48:08.419
He told me that
he would sue me

48:08.453 --> 48:12.057
if I ever said anything
to anyone, you understand.

48:12.090 --> 48:14.459
Uh, you know, I...
I'm, I know this is a lot

48:14.492 --> 48:17.295
but we're actually
in the same boat, okay?

48:17.328 --> 48:19.106
And I'm just, I'm
really worried about Sophie.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.565
That's all, really.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.203
Thank you. Thank you.

48:30.108 --> 48:31.609
What do you want to know?

48:31.642 --> 48:33.011
Uh, is there just anything

48:33.044 --> 48:35.513
you can tell me about Sophie.

48:35.546 --> 48:37.582
Besides the fact that
she's genuinely unsettled.

48:37.615 --> 48:41.086
They told me she
is borderline bipolar

48:41.119 --> 48:43.955
that she has
these night terrors.

48:43.989 --> 48:47.292
I mean, is this, is this
something that you believe?

48:47.325 --> 48:50.028
I... I do believe
the child is troubled, yes.

48:50.061 --> 48:53.031
But I think they
are the reason.

48:53.064 --> 48:55.466
They do not
love her, that I know.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.135
And... and I can't say for sure

48:57.168 --> 48:59.170
but I think they're the ones

48:59.204 --> 49:01.306
who hurt her too.

49:01.339 --> 49:03.141
Why else would
a child always want

49:03.174 --> 49:04.575
to sleep with a knife.

49:04.609 --> 49:07.979
I'm sorry, a knife?
What?

49:08.013 --> 49:09.947
And what do you
mean they hurt her? What?

49:14.019 --> 49:17.255
I've already said
too much, Ms. Pratt.

49:17.288 --> 49:20.491
I'm sorry, but...
I just can't jeopardize

49:20.525 --> 49:22.427
my family over this anymore.

49:22.460 --> 49:24.595
I... I... I, I wish you all the best

49:24.629 --> 49:26.131
but, but I have
to ask you to leave.

49:26.164 --> 49:28.466
What do you..
Okay, fine. Fine.

49:30.201 --> 49:31.502
Thank you.

49:59.097 --> 50:02.067
Excuse me one
second. Summer.

50:02.100 --> 50:04.702
Hello. Hey, baby,
how's the day off?

50:04.735 --> 50:06.137
Uh, it's good.

50:06.171 --> 50:07.438
Um, hey, did you know

50:07.472 --> 50:09.274
Lily is a stripper?

50:10.375 --> 50:12.110
Excuse me?
- Yeah!

50:12.143 --> 50:15.180
Some place called
Sugar Babies by Sacramento.

50:15.213 --> 50:17.448
Please tell me you
didn't know about this.

50:17.482 --> 50:19.184
Um, I mean, did I know

50:19.217 --> 50:21.752
she was a dancer at one time?

50:21.786 --> 50:24.289
Yes, that may have
come up in conversation

50:24.322 --> 50:25.790
with Travis once or twice.

50:25.823 --> 50:28.193
'I assumed it was
ages ago, and it's not like'

50:28.226 --> 50:29.560
'I've known them that long, so.'

50:29.594 --> 50:30.637
Yeah, well, it doesn't seem

50:30.661 --> 50:32.130
like ages ago on the site.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.698
What site?

50:33.731 --> 50:35.833
These matches
spilled out of Lily's purse

50:35.866 --> 50:38.103
and it said Sugar Baby,
so I looked it up

50:38.136 --> 50:40.738
and there was her photo.

50:40.771 --> 50:43.574
I mean, I... I don't think they
moved down from Sacramento

50:43.608 --> 50:47.345
until last year, so, uh,
I guess it's, it's possible

50:47.378 --> 50:48.822
she could have still
been working there recently.

50:48.846 --> 50:51.082
Yeah, but why would she?

50:51.116 --> 50:52.393
I mean, Travis has
enough money for her

50:52.417 --> 50:54.619
to never work
another day in her life.

50:54.652 --> 50:56.587
'And where does all this
money come from anyway?'

50:56.621 --> 50:58.156
I don't... I don't know,
family I assume.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.126
Baby, what is this about?
What happened?

51:01.159 --> 51:04.262
Nothing. I just..
I don't know.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.307
I don't agree with the way
they are raising their child.

51:06.331 --> 51:08.166
You know, there's
not one picture of Sophie

51:08.199 --> 51:10.168
in the entire house.

51:10.201 --> 51:12.203
And how did they
get sleeping pills

51:12.237 --> 51:14.172
for a child without a doctor?

51:14.205 --> 51:15.549
'I thought you said
things were going well.'

51:15.573 --> 51:16.683
Maybe I should
cancel this meeting

51:16.707 --> 51:17.718
and come home
for the weekend.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.477
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

51:19.510 --> 51:21.446
It's fine.
Uh, you're right.

51:21.479 --> 51:22.413
I haven't talked to
them about any of this.

51:22.447 --> 51:24.582
That's my fault, I should..

51:24.615 --> 51:27.218
I'm okay, alright. It's fine.

51:27.252 --> 51:29.254
You're sure?
- 'Yes.'

51:29.287 --> 51:30.331
'Yes, maybe I have just been'

51:30.355 --> 51:32.723
spending too much time there.

51:32.757 --> 51:34.725
Just have a good lunch,
knock 'em dead, alright?

51:34.759 --> 51:36.294
'Okay, thank you, baby.'

51:36.327 --> 51:38.196
I'll..

51:38.229 --> 51:39.873
I'll call you later
tonight, okay? I love you.

51:39.897 --> 51:41.432
Okay, me too.

51:43.301 --> 51:46.337
I told you she was
rehearsed, didn't I?

51:46.371 --> 51:48.306
Yeah. If she
was really married

51:48.339 --> 51:49.374
to Travis all this time

51:49.407 --> 51:51.176
why would she still be dancing?

51:51.209 --> 51:52.853
Even if the photo's old,
it can't be older than your

51:52.877 --> 51:54.879
10-year-old daughter.

51:54.912 --> 51:56.157
Well, maybe they
haven't been married

51:56.181 --> 51:58.216
for as long as
they said they were.

51:58.249 --> 52:02.320
Or maybe Sophie isn't his child.

52:02.353 --> 52:04.455
Why would you say that?

52:04.489 --> 52:05.823
Maybe Lily married him

52:05.856 --> 52:08.693
and he adopted
himself a daughter.

52:08.726 --> 52:09.836
But if Travis doesn't want kids

52:09.860 --> 52:11.829
why would he adopt her?

52:11.862 --> 52:13.864
Maybe Lily didn't
give him a choice.

52:13.898 --> 52:17.868
It would explain
the resentment towards Sophie.

52:17.902 --> 52:22.607
I bet he's trying
to hide Lily's sordid past.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.942
They have a reputation
to protect, remember?

52:24.975 --> 52:27.945
Yeah, but it, still,
it doesn't explain the abuse.

52:27.978 --> 52:30.348
I understand the neglect.

52:30.381 --> 52:32.750
But even the old nanny
said that they hurt her

52:32.783 --> 52:34.885
and that she was
sleeping with a knife.

52:39.290 --> 52:41.492
I'm gonna see if I
can look into her records.

52:41.526 --> 52:44.562
Okay.

53:03.948 --> 53:05.516
Hello.

53:13.624 --> 53:14.792
Hello?

53:16.527 --> 53:18.863
Lily, Lily.

53:18.896 --> 53:21.666
Lily, Lily. Hey, hey.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.768
Hey. Hey!

53:23.801 --> 53:25.503
Wake up, wake up!

53:25.536 --> 53:27.738
Lily!
- Hmm.

53:38.683 --> 53:39.884
'Sophie.'

54:02.006 --> 54:03.874
Hey, hey, hey!

54:05.576 --> 54:06.644
Hey.

54:09.013 --> 54:10.781
'Good morning.'
- Sophie!

54:10.815 --> 54:12.459
What are you, what are you
doing with scissors in your bed?

54:12.483 --> 54:14.485
You could've really hurt me.

54:14.519 --> 54:18.022
Or yourself.
- I'm sorry.

54:18.055 --> 54:20.725
Good morning.

54:20.758 --> 54:22.660
'Mommy hides all
the knives at night.'

54:24.662 --> 54:26.831
Why would you need either?

54:26.864 --> 54:27.798
You didn't have
anything the other night

54:27.832 --> 54:29.434
when I put you to bed.

54:29.467 --> 54:31.669
'I thought you'd
stay over to watch me.'

54:33.738 --> 54:36.807
When I woke up,
you were gone.

54:40.645 --> 54:42.513
Sophie, you know I
have to go home eventually.

54:42.547 --> 54:45.416
I can't always be here.

54:45.450 --> 54:46.984
But if you are afraid

54:47.017 --> 54:49.554
that someone
is trying to hurt you

54:49.587 --> 54:51.522
you need to tell me, okay?

54:53.123 --> 54:54.992
Did somebody try to hurt you?

54:57.895 --> 55:01.031
Hey, your friend, Sasha..

55:02.600 --> 55:05.703
Did she, uh..

55:05.736 --> 55:09.574
Does she have a
different last name than you?

55:09.607 --> 55:11.609
You can tell me what it is?

55:11.642 --> 55:14.479
Carter.
- Carter.

55:14.512 --> 55:16.881
And does Sasha
have a different mommy?

55:16.914 --> 55:19.350
One that kinda
looks like your mommy?

55:19.384 --> 55:21.852
They have the
same hair color and stuff.

55:21.886 --> 55:25.055
Okay. And what about
Sasha's mommy's real name?

55:28.593 --> 55:31.929
Tara.
- Tara.

55:31.962 --> 55:33.464
Tara Carter.

55:34.665 --> 55:35.800
Good.

55:37.402 --> 55:39.036
Thank you for trusting me.

55:39.069 --> 55:40.405
Why don't you get ready

55:40.438 --> 55:42.407
and come out,
we make breakfast?

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
Okay?

55:47.144 --> 55:49.414
I think the record
should say Sasha Carter

55:49.447 --> 55:52.116
and I think Lily's former
name would be Tara Carter.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.486
Okay, good. That's
what we'll start with.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.121
Okay.

55:57.154 --> 55:59.624
Monica..

55:59.657 --> 56:03.661
Sophie has burn scars all over
her shoulders and upper arms.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.897
What?
- 'Yeah.'

56:06.931 --> 56:09.500
Okay, listen, I
will get Andrea on this

56:09.534 --> 56:10.668
and get back to you ASAP.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.103
Okay, thank you.

56:13.137 --> 56:14.639
Oh, geez!

56:16.841 --> 56:18.051
Wow, you look
like, you look like

56:18.075 --> 56:20.044
you had some fun last night.

56:22.980 --> 56:24.815
Are you, are you okay?

56:27.818 --> 56:31.188
Hmm. - What's...
what's going on?

56:31.221 --> 56:33.057
Can I, can I help
you with anything?

56:35.493 --> 56:37.695
It's Travis.
I just..

56:39.664 --> 56:40.831
I just really screwed up.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.399
What happened?

56:43.768 --> 56:45.536
It's all kind of a blur.

56:46.771 --> 56:47.838
We had some people over

56:47.872 --> 56:49.073
and I had a few drinks

56:49.106 --> 56:52.076
and, I don't know, I don't..

56:52.109 --> 56:54.411
I don't remember much
after that.

56:56.647 --> 56:58.616
He didn't hit you, did he?
- What do you mean?

56:58.649 --> 57:00.217
Your cheek, you have a..

57:00.250 --> 57:01.986
You have a
bruise on your cheek.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.754
Oh, my God!

57:03.788 --> 57:06.557
Uh! Oh, my God.

57:08.926 --> 57:12.563
'Yes, hello again.
Her name is Sasha Carter.'

57:12.597 --> 57:14.465
Uh, but the spelling's
a bit smudged here

57:14.499 --> 57:16.767
in the medical records request.

57:16.801 --> 57:18.936
I think her
mother's name is Tara.

57:33.618 --> 57:36.487
I gotta take this.

57:36.521 --> 57:37.722
Hello.

57:39.189 --> 57:40.257
Yeah, it's me.

57:40.290 --> 57:42.226
Tara, no calls on the clock.

57:42.259 --> 57:45.195
Hefner, kiss my ass.

57:45.229 --> 57:48.065
Who the hell is asking?

57:48.098 --> 57:50.868
No, I don't know no
pediatrician in San Fernando valley.

57:54.972 --> 57:57.575
Oh, no, no, we... we,
actually I did call them.

57:57.608 --> 58:00.611
Uh, I'm gonna visit my
little sister down in LA.

58:00.645 --> 58:02.589
I wanted to make sure that
she's got a doctor down there

58:02.613 --> 58:03.881
and copy of her records.

58:03.914 --> 58:06.050
Uh-uh, who'd you say is, uh..

58:06.083 --> 58:07.985
Who'd you say it is?

58:09.620 --> 58:13.090
Yeah, yeah, Dr. Thorne,
that's right.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.093
Yeah, yeah, you can
give 'em Sasha's records.

58:16.126 --> 58:18.629
Thank you so much
for checking with me.

58:18.663 --> 58:20.965
Okay. Bye.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.933
Tara, this ain't
your damn break.

58:22.967 --> 58:25.970
I need the rest of the
day off. Tomorrow too.

58:26.003 --> 58:27.605
'What the hell for?'

58:27.638 --> 58:29.574
Going to get my daughter back.

58:44.955 --> 58:47.157
What's up?

58:47.191 --> 58:49.259
Things have been
really bad over here.

58:49.293 --> 58:51.729
I think Travis
hit Lily last night.

58:51.762 --> 58:53.731
Yeah. I mean,
I don't know for sure

58:53.764 --> 58:56.100
but I found drugs in their room

58:56.133 --> 58:58.344
and not only pills, but a
whole bunch of other stuff too.

58:58.368 --> 59:01.171
Oh, geez.
How is Sophie?

59:01.205 --> 59:03.741
I don't know, she
seems fine, just a little shaken

59:03.774 --> 59:05.810
when I woke
her up today, but..

59:05.843 --> 59:07.144
Did you find anything?

59:07.177 --> 59:08.879
'You were right about the name.'

59:08.913 --> 59:11.882
Apparently, Sasha
Carter is Sophie's real name

59:11.916 --> 59:13.651
and her mother is Tara.

59:13.684 --> 59:16.086
Her father is a Gerald Jones.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.355
So I was right.
Travis is not her real father.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.090
Lily must have,
I don't know, decided

59:20.124 --> 59:22.727
to start a new life
and come here with Sophie.

59:22.760 --> 59:23.870
'What about her
scars, anything?'

59:23.894 --> 59:26.030
Yeah, yeah.

59:26.063 --> 59:28.032
Well, she has
second degree burns

59:28.065 --> 59:30.067
on both her
arms and shoulders.

59:30.100 --> 59:32.903
Apparently, she accidentally
pulled a pot of boiling water

59:32.937 --> 59:35.105
on herself, and Tara
was there when it happened.

59:35.139 --> 59:36.841
Oh, my God,
no wonder she refuses

59:36.874 --> 59:38.609
to go anywhere
near the kitchen stove.

59:38.643 --> 59:41.779
She does have
borderline bipolar disorder.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.681
So at least they
weren't lying there.

59:43.714 --> 59:45.125
'Yeah, which is all the more
reason to get her out of here.'

59:45.149 --> 59:48.886
This place is not
safe for any child.

59:48.919 --> 59:51.055
Especially one
as fragile as she is.

59:51.088 --> 59:54.024
Are you over there now?
- 'Yeah, I am. I'm out back.'

59:54.058 --> 59:58.028
Lily, Tara, whatever
her name is, is here too.

59:58.062 --> 59:59.205
I don't even know if
she's gonna leave today.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.766
She's so hung over.

01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:03.343
Summer, maybe you
should call the police.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.736
No.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.781
No, they won't let the
cops in here without a warrant.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.006
There's no way.

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:10.407
And they have ties

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.409
with very powerful
people in this town.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:14.011
'They'll just get rid of me.'

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.780
'I cannot take
this chance with Sophie.'

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.882
So, what are you gonna do?

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.784
I'm gonna try to get
her out of here myself.

01:00:24.922 --> 01:00:27.424
You can't just drive
down there and grab her.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.259
It don't work that way.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.095
It's exactly
what she did to me.

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.230
Took her to pizza,
never came back.

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:38.302
Hi, Andrea, it's Tara
over at Stockton Medical.

01:00:38.335 --> 01:00:40.437
You guys called
earlier requesting record

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:43.173
for Sasha Carter.
You received?

01:00:43.207 --> 01:00:44.975
'Yes, we did.
Thank you very much.'

01:00:45.009 --> 01:00:48.846
Fantastic. Oh, we
actually have a small balance

01:00:48.879 --> 01:00:50.915
from a previous bill
that we never collected

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:52.349
before they moved.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.694
Any chance I could
get a current address

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.185
so we can mail that over?

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:58.923
Mm-hmm.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:01.759
"Lily Walsh."

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.863
Yeah, got it.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.231
That is wonderful.
Thank you.

01:01:07.264 --> 01:01:09.734
I only ever
knew her as Lily Carter.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.002
It's nice to hear
she finally got married.

01:01:12.036 --> 01:01:15.706
Thank you so much, Andrea.

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:17.083
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:19.209
You're on parole, you
can't even leave the county.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:21.979
I am tired of things
being taken from me.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.124
'When I was a kid, what
little love my mother did have'

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:26.450
when she wasn't beating
the hell out of us went to her.

01:01:26.483 --> 01:01:28.228
My husband cuts his
wrist, everybody blames me.

01:01:28.252 --> 01:01:30.120
You were there!

01:01:30.154 --> 01:01:32.356
It doesn't matter,
you're not gonna get charged.

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:34.324
Everyone knew Gerald
was a nutcase anyway.

01:01:34.358 --> 01:01:36.260
Oh, what now-now
she and my kid are living

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:38.128
in the lap of luxury,
down in the big city

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:41.398
while I waste away up
here, waiting for it all to end?

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:44.201
I'll be damned
if this is the end.

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:47.137
Well, you leave,
you're damned either way.

01:02:07.291 --> 01:02:08.492
Hey, you need
me around today?

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.360
Are you kidding me?

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.838
I wouldn't be caught
dead going anywhere

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.131
looking like this.
Why?

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.333
Uh, I thought I could show you

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.903
some of the fabric
samples I picked up this weekend.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:21.305
I was in such a rush
today, I forgot them.

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:23.507
But I thought
I could go grab them.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.109
Maybe Sophie could come with.

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:27.912
Yeah, I haven't
been to your house yet.

01:02:29.379 --> 01:02:32.482
Can I go, mom? Please.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:35.786
No, sweetie, you don't
need to be going out today.

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.922
Summer will be
just fine without you.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.556
You can play
when she gets back.

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:41.258
'You remember what daddy said.'

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.260
You never let me go anywhere!

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:45.195
'It will be really quick,
just there and back.'

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:47.464
That's it. And
it's overcast today.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:51.235
I'm sorry, Summer, I just
can't deal with this today.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:53.170
The answer is no.

01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:02.179
Hey, I bet you she won't
even notice we're gone.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:04.849
You wanna go grab a backpack,
and some crossword puzzles?

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.956
Hey, listen..

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:13.266
How would you
like to sneak away

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.960
for a little while,
just me and you.

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:18.362
Just until we figure some
things out with your mom and dad.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:19.930
How would you
feel about that, huh?

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.032
I think I'd like
to be with you.

01:03:22.066 --> 01:03:23.868
Yeah?

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.781
You're not happy here
most of the time, are you?

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.082
We could go to
the beach house.

01:03:29.106 --> 01:03:30.140
Yeah.

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:31.441
I love that place.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.618
You think mom
and dad would think

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.211
to look for you there?

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.313
Nope. It's a
great place to hide.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.447
There's a set of keys

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:39.549
under the bamboo plant.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:42.386
Anyways, they'd
never come looking for me.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.389
You're the only one that tries

01:03:45.422 --> 01:03:49.259
to find me when I hide.

01:03:49.293 --> 01:03:51.161
Well, then let's go
over and hide there.

01:03:57.434 --> 01:04:00.337
Hey.
- He-hey.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.572
Are you guys going somewhere?

01:04:02.606 --> 01:04:04.374
Um, no, actually, we were just...

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.610
Sophie, go to
your room, please.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:09.446
'But... '
- I said go.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.580
'Go, now.'

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.929
Where were you taking her?

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:26.272
I told you,
to pick up the fabrics.

01:04:26.296 --> 01:04:27.407
I don't believe you, Summer.

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.266
What's really going on here?

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.676
Yeah, actually, you
know, why don't you tell me

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.202
what's really going on here?

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:33.313
I'm not one
that has been lying

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:35.505
ever since we met, Tara Carter.

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.042
Wait, you think
she's Tara Carter?

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:40.477
Yeah, actually, I know a
lot more than you think I do.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.446
About Sasha, the scars.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.381
That you two have
been very bad parents.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.283
We're not actually
her parents, okay?

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:51.588
'I'm not Tara,
and Sophie isn't mine.'

01:04:51.621 --> 01:04:55.292
The reason we look a lot
alike is because I'm her aunt.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.894
Tara is Sophie's
biological mother, alright?

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.332
Tara is the one who
threw boiling water

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.334
all over Sophie, and
gave her those scars, okay?

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.570
'It wasn't me.'
- You just kidnapped her?

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.472
What was I supposed
to do, just leave her

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:11.375
with my psychotic sister?

01:05:11.408 --> 01:05:13.610
Tara might be tried for
murdering Sophie's father.

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.245
Oh, my God!

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:19.316
Wow, this is..
This is a lot.

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:22.186
Yeah. Yes, so as
you can see

01:05:22.219 --> 01:05:24.254
we're doing the
best that we can here.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:25.598
'I just don't think that the
answer is to bring her here'

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.691
and treat her like
she doesn't exist.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:29.626
You guys don't let her out.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:31.128
You don't let
her make any friends.

01:05:31.161 --> 01:05:33.197
You guys don't act
like real parents should.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.670
The only reason
we don't take her out

01:05:34.698 --> 01:05:37.334
is 'cause Tara's
probably looking for her, okay?

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.711
And what would you
know about parenting?

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.570
You never even had your baby.

01:05:42.672 --> 01:05:45.742
I know that you don't
pop pills in front of them

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.012
and you don't
smack your wife around

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:50.514
'or hit on the nanny
when she's ten feet away.'

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:52.316
Sorry, you got thrown into this

01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:54.151
'cause your sister is bad.

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:55.685
'Child negligence'

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:58.122
is an equally
awful form of abuse.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:00.424
Even if the kid's
crazy? - Oh, my God.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:01.992
'She's wielding sharp objects.'

01:06:02.026 --> 01:06:04.294
She's cutting herself
all the time.

01:06:04.328 --> 01:06:05.229
You know, maybe we
should just let her take her.

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:06.596
No, come on.

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.241
I don't think she
wants to stay here anyway.

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:10.467
She hates us.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.501
Wow.

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:16.606
Oh, and for the record..

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.542
I never hit her.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:21.345
She fell off the
bed, high off her ass.

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.580
Got that one all
yourself, didn't you?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:29.353
Did he really come on to you?

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.321
Oh, that is really
all you have to say

01:06:31.355 --> 01:06:32.622
after all of that?

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.657
You are so selfish.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.159
Oh, do you think you could do

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:36.526
a better job
raising her yourself?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.562
Yeah, actually I do.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:42.499
Right, because
you're so perfect.

01:06:42.532 --> 01:06:44.668
You know nothing
about my life, okay?

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:47.037
Lily, stop.

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:49.173
Stop, I know everything.

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:50.674
Okay? I know everything.

01:06:53.477 --> 01:06:56.080
I did what I had to do

01:06:56.113 --> 01:06:59.049
to create a better
life for myself, okay?

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:02.252
So don't, don't you judge me.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:04.488
Yeah.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:06.556
So you could
have a better life.

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:07.724
Exactly.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:20.746
'Why didn't you
tell me any of this?'

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.806
I'm sorry, it just
got bad so fast.

01:07:22.839 --> 01:07:25.209
I couldn't believe it
myself. - Did they fire you?

01:07:25.242 --> 01:07:26.810
Well, they didn't
invite me back.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:29.213
I said some pretty
hard stuff to both of them.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:30.790
'Sounds like it's true.'
- I'm so sorry.

01:07:30.814 --> 01:07:33.117
What if he fires you?
- 'Do not worry about that.'

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.685
'I'm not worried, and
you shouldn't be either.'

01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:37.321
I'm gonna finish up
here, and I'm gonna

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:38.864
book a flight home
for tomorrow afternoon.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.490
Okay, yeah, thank
you, it would be..

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:43.427
It would be so much
better if you were here.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.796
Just.. what are we gonna do?

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.633
I feel so helpless, like..

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.801
I just.. I don't want to
leave her there, you know.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:53.703
That's not our decision,
alright?

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.707
'Maybe confronting
them on these issues there'

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.443
'they'll try harder.'

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.545
'We can all talk it
out when I get back.'

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.123
I just don't get it, I
could be such a good mother

01:08:03.147 --> 01:08:04.381
to someone like her.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:05.682
'Hey..'

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.851
'And some day you will be.'

01:08:07.884 --> 01:08:09.453
I know you're
concerned about Sophie

01:08:09.486 --> 01:08:12.489
but you, you said
that she's sharp, right?

01:08:12.522 --> 01:08:14.158
Yeah.
- She'll be fine.

01:08:14.191 --> 01:08:15.592
Sure hope so.

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:27.491
Sasha.

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:31.261
You in here?

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:35.364
Sasha?

01:12:09.759 --> 01:12:11.528
Hello.
- Summer.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.729
Do you know where Sophie is?

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:14.030
No, I haven't talked to her.

01:12:14.063 --> 01:12:15.365
Are you telling
me the truth?

01:12:15.399 --> 01:12:16.700
You didn't pick her up?

01:12:16.733 --> 01:12:19.769
No, is sh-she not..
Is she not at the house?

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:21.371
No, she's not out back.

01:12:21.405 --> 01:12:22.682
She's not-she's not in her room.

01:12:22.706 --> 01:12:24.641
I don't where she is.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:25.875
Okay, I'll come help you look.

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:27.411
Okay, fine.

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:35.652
Hey, I can't talk right now.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.454
Summer, hey, listen to me

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:39.656
I've got more news
about Sophie's mother Tara.

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.425
Yeah, I know,
Lily's not her mom.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.959
She told me
everything yesterday.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:44.861
I... I'll call you
when I can, okay?

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:46.930
'Well, but you know
that she called us yesterday?'

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:49.132
Wait, what? Who?

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:52.836
Stockton Medical Center
called Tara to confirm

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.471
the transfer of
the medical records.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.473
Apparently our verbal
request wasn't enough.

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:59.142
'Tara called here
posing as a nurse.'

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:00.977
And Andrea didn't
put it all together

01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:02.479
until Stockton
called this morning

01:13:02.512 --> 01:13:04.848
confirming the
receipt of the records.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.116
That's when she
crosschecked the caller IDs.

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.618
Okay, what did she want?

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:11.688
The address.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.089
The Walshes address.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.190
Oh, my gosh.

01:13:22.699 --> 01:13:24.067
When was the
last time you saw her?

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.670
I... I don't know, last
night around 8:00 or 9:00.

01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:27.813
I asked her if she
wanted something to eat

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:28.772
but she wouldn't
come out of her room.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:30.073
Okay, what about Travis?

01:13:30.106 --> 01:13:31.216
He left for work this morning

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.942
and he's not
picking up his phone.

01:13:32.976 --> 01:13:34.644
Oh, Lily, I have
to tell you something.

01:13:34.678 --> 01:13:36.546
What?

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.023
Tara knows where you
guys live, she found out.

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:39.215
What? How?

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.684
Yeah, she called Monica's office

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:41.818
and she posed as a nurse.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.553
Oh, my God.

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:44.697
Oh, my God. If Travis
left the gate open

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:46.656
then Tara could've taken her.

01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:48.692
Why isn't he
answering his phone?

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:51.160
Sophie!

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:52.996
Sophie!
- Sophie, honey.

01:13:55.064 --> 01:13:57.100
Sophie!

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:59.002
Where could she be?

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.473
Sophie!

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.475
Sophie!

01:14:07.611 --> 01:14:08.878
Oh, my God. Summer.
- What?

01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:13.216
Tara's definitely been here.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:14.818
Okay. - What
are we gonna do?

01:14:14.851 --> 01:14:17.020
I don't know,
I don't know. I don't know.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:18.922
Let's go, come on,
come on. - Oh, my God.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.560
Sophie.
- Summer!

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:24.604
I don't know
what you're looking for.

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:25.929
I've already been in here.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:26.996
Sophie.

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.567
Oh, my gosh.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.169
What is it?
- "A great place to hide."

01:14:33.202 --> 01:14:35.539
Sophie, she left this for me.
She left this for me to find.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:36.849
Give it to me.
- She knew I'd come looking.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:38.217
The beach house.
- What does it mean?

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:39.676
Let's go to the beach house.

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:42.822
Why would Tara take
her to the beach house?

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:44.781
She doesn't even know
where it is.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.158
And Sophie wouldn't
remember something like that.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:48.184
Sophie remembered your
spare key under the bamboo.

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:50.053
If I'm right, she
convinced her to go there.

01:14:50.086 --> 01:14:51.087
Okay.

01:15:01.565 --> 01:15:03.266
You wanna give me a hand?

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.004
What?

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:13.009
'Sasha, you know
that was an accident.'

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:14.820
Come on, how many
times have I apologized to you

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.547
after it happened?

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:19.282
Why did you come to get me?

01:15:19.315 --> 01:15:20.817
Because you're mine!

01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:38.568
You have no idea how
hard it was for me after you left.

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:43.873
You know, trying get the
help I needed from welfare

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.642
how pissed your daddy was

01:15:45.675 --> 01:15:47.143
always taking it out on me.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:51.080
You don't care, do you?

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.719
Too busy having
fun with your Aunt Lil.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:57.654
It wasn't very
fun most of the time.

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.124
No?

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.307
Well, that is
the first good news

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:09.999
I've heard in a while.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:17.040
Did you know, there is..

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.842
just one question

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:22.679
that I can't get off of my mind.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:25.314
Did you wanna go?

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:27.016
You're kidding?

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:30.353
I begged her to take me.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:50.840
Okay, what you think
the odds are she has a gun?

01:16:50.874 --> 01:16:53.743
Oh, I'd say about as
good as my husband cheating.

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:55.879
Like he tried with you.
- Yeah, okay.

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:18.134
Shh, shh, shh.
- Okay.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:20.079
Why are there cars if
there's no people or anything?

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:21.705
Well, it's mostly
a summer home, so.

01:17:36.019 --> 01:17:38.087
If I go, if I go in the front..

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:40.232
If I go in the door and
distract her long enough, right?

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:42.759
Then you can come,
slip in from downstairs

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:43.927
and grab Sophie, alright?

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.729
Okay?
- No, no, no, wait.

01:17:45.762 --> 01:17:46.806
If Sophie calls you by name

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:48.898
Tara will know it's foul play.

01:17:48.932 --> 01:17:50.442
And I'm her sister,
she's not gonna hurt me.

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:53.870
It makes sense for me
to try to reason with her.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:56.072
Okay, how about I go upstairs

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.807
you sneak up from behind

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:00.143
and then you just knock her out.

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:01.911
You sure about that?

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:05.114
Look, the only reason
I took Sophie that day

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.458
was because she
refused to get out of my car

01:18:06.482 --> 01:18:09.285
when I tried to say goodbye.

01:18:09.318 --> 01:18:11.888
You were right,
about everything.

01:18:11.921 --> 01:18:14.123
I was a coward,
I did what was easy for me

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:17.460
out of fear and guilt.

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:19.195
You know what?

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:22.198
I didn't stand up to
Tara then, but I can now.

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:24.467
It's time for me
to do something right.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:36.913
Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.435
'You think you're
smarter than me?'

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:01.204
Huh?

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.484
Someone teach you
how to use one of these

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.410
while you were
with your Aunt Lil?

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:11.314
No? I didn't think so.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:17.120
Spoilt brat with your girly
room and fancy nightlights.

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:27.263
You scream, I shoot her.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.533
Don't get anyone killed, huh?

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.183
Thought you said they
wouldn't look for us here.

01:19:44.981 --> 01:19:46.549
Hey, sis.

01:19:46.582 --> 01:19:48.517
And how'd you know we were here?

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:52.121
Um, surveillance. We have
them hidden around the property.

01:19:52.155 --> 01:19:54.457
So.. Hello.

01:19:56.993 --> 01:20:00.363
Um, Sophie didn't,
Sasha... didn't know.

01:20:01.998 --> 01:20:04.400
Sophie's a crap name,
by the way.

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:06.602
Well, it was our
grandmother's name.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:07.937
Yeah, she was a crap
grandmother.

01:20:07.971 --> 01:20:09.272
'Okay, look, Tara, I'm not here'

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.941
'to take Sasha back, okay?'

01:20:11.975 --> 01:20:14.543
'The truth is,
it's, it's been kinda hard'

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.445
'having her around, actually.'

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:21.885
I guess, I realized
that I just, um..

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:23.819
'I wasn't cut out
to be a mother.'

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:28.224
But I do love her, and I just..

01:20:28.257 --> 01:20:29.959
I wanted to say goodbye.

01:20:32.095 --> 01:20:33.329
Get down!

01:21:05.995 --> 01:21:07.630
I'll never let you have her.

01:21:10.633 --> 01:21:12.468
You'll ruin her
like mom ruined us.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.976
It's gonna be hard to come
after me when you're in jail

01:21:20.009 --> 01:21:22.678
for the murder of your husband.

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.482
Come on, let's go.

01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:30.987
She killed Travis.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.655
She killed Travis.
- Run! Run! Run!

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:34.657
Let's go. Let's go.
- Here we go.

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:35.690
Come on.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.616
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

01:22:45.328 --> 01:22:48.197
'Hey!'
- Don't shoot.

01:22:48.231 --> 01:22:50.499
Don't shoot! Sophie.

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:53.036
Fine, bring her to me.

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:56.005
'Now!'

01:22:56.039 --> 01:22:57.482
Okay. Here, look at
me. Look at me, okay?

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:01.144
If you let me go,
then she'll shoot you.

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:03.512
It's okay.
- No.

01:23:03.546 --> 01:23:07.050
It's okay, look at me.
You're a warrior, remember?

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:08.651
You're a warrior.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:11.120
Okay, so what I'm gonna do..

01:23:11.154 --> 01:23:13.122
is I'm gonna put you down.

01:23:13.156 --> 01:23:15.024
And then you're gonna run.

01:23:15.058 --> 01:23:16.425
Okay, you hear
me, you're gonna run

01:23:16.459 --> 01:23:18.461
and you're never
going to look back, alright?

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.496
You understand me?
You promise me?

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:22.465
Do you promise?

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:25.368
Sasha, let the lady
put you down.

01:23:25.401 --> 01:23:26.702
It's okay.

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:33.376
Sasha, come to mommy, now.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:39.082
Tara, take her.
Just take her, please.

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:41.750
Take her.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.489
Come here, Sasha.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:48.391
My name is Sophie now.

01:24:22.725 --> 01:24:25.594
Sweet Dreams, kiwis and
creams is definitely the way to go.

01:24:25.628 --> 01:24:27.596
No, no, no, it's all
about the Perfect Day

01:24:27.630 --> 01:24:30.233
pralines and pistachio.
It's easily the best.

01:24:30.266 --> 01:24:31.443
No way! - Describes
the day the best.

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:33.436
No way! Okay,
that calls for a vote.

01:24:33.469 --> 01:24:34.646
What do you
think, Soph? - Huh?

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:36.672
Hm?

01:24:36.705 --> 01:24:39.342
I think the next time..

01:24:39.375 --> 01:24:41.410
I'm gonna get
Very Happy Vanilla Bean.

01:24:42.478 --> 01:24:43.846
Woo!

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:48.117
Well, you ready to go home?

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:50.453
Yeah. Alright, let's go.

01:24:57.493 --> 01:25:00.363
"Fairy Godmother
waved to the girl

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:03.166
as she left her
to live in the castle.

01:25:03.199 --> 01:25:06.502
Now and forever
more to be a princess.

01:25:06.535 --> 01:25:08.771
Happily ever after."

01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:21.817
# Fly away fly away

01:25:23.219 --> 01:25:28.524
# Far away far away

01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:34.297
# May you always be happy

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:39.935
# May you always be free

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:41.304
# With the winds..

01:25:41.337 --> 01:25:44.607
Summer?
- Yeah?

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:47.610
Are you my Fairy Godmother?
- No.

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:50.413
Just a girl who
always wanted to be a mom.

01:25:50.446 --> 01:25:53.582
But we will
live happily ever after!

01:25:56.885 --> 01:26:01.424
# Anytime at any place

01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:30.786
# Fly away fly away

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:36.559
# Far away far away

01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:41.997
# May you always be happy

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:47.670
# May you always be free

01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:53.476
# With the wind at your back

01:26:53.509 --> 01:26:59.315
# And the sunlight on your face

01:26:59.348 --> 01:27:04.787
# May the road
rise up to meet you

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:09.458
# Anytime at any place

01:27:10.305 --> 01:27:16.271
