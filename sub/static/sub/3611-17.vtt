WEBVTT

00:13.431 --> 00:16.923
What is it? Why are we stopping?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.596
You'll see.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.121
Well, it's a wonderful foot, Richard,
but what's it have to do with Jacob?

00:45.379 --> 00:46.915
It's where he lives.

01:04.148 --> 01:06.764
- What's going on, Kate?
- Doc, we gotta talk.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.989
- You wanna talk, get in the van...
- I ain't gettin' in the van!

01:15.117 --> 01:19.281
I need five minutes. Say what I gotta
say, then you can do whatever you want.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.573
But you're gonna listen.
You owe me that much.

01:28.673 --> 01:30.004
Five minutes.

02:01.664 --> 02:04.827
Dr. Shephard? You all right?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.203
The dural sac. I cut it.

02:08.546 --> 02:11.003
- Give me some suction.
- Calm down. It's all right.

02:11.090 --> 02:13.297
- Fluid's leaking.
- Look at me.

02:13.384 --> 02:16.376
- Give me some suction.
- Jack.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.468
Look at me.

02:19.682 --> 02:22.389
Count to five.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.385
- What are you talking about?
- Stitching up the sac

02:25.521 --> 02:28.604
so this girl isn't paralyzed
for the rest of her life.

02:28.733 --> 02:32.146
The only way you're gonna do that
is not to be afraid.

02:32.236 --> 02:35.728
So close your eyes and count to five.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.189
And then fix her, Jack.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.573
Or I'll have to fix her for you.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.795
One, two,

02:56.927 --> 02:59.919
three, four...

03:01.724 --> 03:02.759
...five.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.052
Sutures.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.495
Hey, kiddo.

03:30.628 --> 03:33.870
Girl's in recovery, responsive
to stimulus below the waist,

03:33.964 --> 03:37.252
so no paralysis.

03:37.927 --> 03:39.792
Good.

03:40.638 --> 03:43.129
Something wrong, Jack?

03:44.016 --> 03:45.301
You embarrassed me.

03:47.144 --> 03:50.227
- Did I?
- It was bad enough

03:50.314 --> 03:53.806
that everybody thinks
the reason I got this residency

03:53.943 --> 03:57.401
is because you're my father.
But then you...

03:57.488 --> 04:00.776
You put me in a timeout
during my first major procedure!

04:00.866 --> 04:03.118
In front of my entire team.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.574
Dad, I know you don't believe in me,

04:07.665 --> 04:09.326
but I need them to.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.869
Are you sure I'm the one
who doesn't believe in you, Jack?

04:23.347 --> 04:24.928
One of these yours?

04:29.145 --> 04:33.229
- Machine got stuck.
- Guess itjust needed a little push.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.372
- Take a load off, doc.
- No, thanks.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.120
Sit down, Jack.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.886
My folks died when l was eight.
I ever tell you that?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.563
No.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.647
Con man took my dad
for everything he had.

05:16.734 --> 05:20.318
He didn't handle it too well, so...

05:20.404 --> 05:25.148
Shot my mom.
Then he blew his own head off.

05:25.242 --> 05:29.076
l was hiding under the bed
when it happened. Heard the whole thing.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.032
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.411
That was a year ago.

05:39.715 --> 05:43.549
- What?
- Right now it's July, 1977.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.718
Which means that happened last year.

05:47.890 --> 05:51.929
So I could have hopped on the sub,
gone back to the States,

05:52.061 --> 05:57.772
walked right into my house and
stopped my daddy from killing anybody.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.936
Why didn't you?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.980
Because, Jack...

06:04.406 --> 06:06.567
...what's done is done.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.948
It doesn't have to be that way.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.121
What did you screw up so bad the
first time, you'll blow up a damn nuke

06:18.212 --> 06:20.624
- for a second chance?
- Not what this is about.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.792
Then what is it about?

06:27.137 --> 06:32.131
Three years ago, Locke told me that
all this was happening for a reason.

06:32.268 --> 06:36.762
- That us being here was our destiny.
- I don't speak destiny.

06:38.315 --> 06:41.022
What I do understand
is a man does what he does

06:41.110 --> 06:43.476
'cause he wants something for himself.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.994
What do you want, Jack?

06:59.628 --> 07:01.493
I had her.

07:03.299 --> 07:06.166
I had her, and I lost her.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.506
Kate?

07:11.390 --> 07:14.302
Damn, doc, she's standing
on the other side of those trees.

07:14.393 --> 07:18.762
- You want her back, just ask her.
- No, it's too late for that.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.645
Your five minutes is up.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.775
Jack! If what you're doing even works,

07:32.870 --> 07:36.829
you and Kate will be strangers.
And she'll be in damn handcuffs.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.531
What's meant to be is meant to be.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.463
I guess there's nothing I can say
that'll change your mind.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.290
I guess there's not.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.006
Who the hell do you think you are?!

08:05.235 --> 08:08.443
Think you can come here
and do whatever the hell you want?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.187
I had a life here!

08:17.581 --> 08:19.287
Sawyer, listen...

08:20.209 --> 08:21.574
You don't get it.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.545
Will you stop?

08:34.640 --> 08:37.131
- Will you stop?!
- No.

08:42.106 --> 08:43.687
James!

08:45.442 --> 08:48.434
- Let him go.
- He wouldn't listen.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.607
- I had to. He won't stop!
- That's because he's right.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.695
- What?
- He's right.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.027
James, we have to do this.

08:58.122 --> 09:00.613
What are you talking about?

09:00.749 --> 09:04.037
You're the one that told me
to come back here and stop him!

09:04.128 --> 09:05.288
What happened?!

09:07.631 --> 09:09.587
I changed my mind.

09:25.899 --> 09:30.563
Girls, your dad and l have something
we need to talk to you both about.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.942
- Are we moving again?
- No, stupid.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.647
- They're getting a divorce.
- Rachel.

09:35.743 --> 09:36.983
Well, aren't you?

09:39.747 --> 09:42.784
- Yes.
- But we need you both to understand

09:42.875 --> 09:48.165
that your father and l,
we still love each other.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.419
Because people love each other doesn't
mean they're supposed to be together.

09:52.509 --> 09:57.424
- What if you are supposed to be?
- We're not, honey.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.051
- But how can you know for sure?
- We just know.

10:01.351 --> 10:04.263
And, when you're a grownup,

10:04.354 --> 10:06.310
you'll understand.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.974
I don't wanna understand!

10:10.068 --> 10:13.777
- Juliet, wait!
- I don't wanna understand!

10:13.864 --> 10:17.027
- Stop! We gotta talk about this!
- There's nothing to talk about.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.530
- Let Jack do what he came here to do.
- Maybe you should have told me

10:20.621 --> 10:23.533
you had a change of heart before
I brought him out to kick his ass!

10:23.624 --> 10:24.864
- Would that have stopped you?
- No!

10:24.958 --> 10:28.792
- Glad you got it out of your system.
- Hey!

10:28.879 --> 10:30.369
Don't!

10:31.381 --> 10:34.748
I need you to tell me
where all this is coming from.

10:34.843 --> 10:38.301
One minute, you're leading the
great sub escape, now you're onboard

10:38.388 --> 10:40.299
with blowing up the damn island?

10:41.642 --> 10:44.884
I got a right to know
why you changed your mind.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.889
I changed my mind
when I saw you look at her.

10:52.528 --> 10:54.564
Don't... Don't.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.898
I don't care who I looked at.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.615
I'm with you.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.908
And you would stay
with me forever if I let you.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.990
And that is why I will always love you.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.994
What we had was just for a while.
Just because we love each other

11:12.089 --> 11:16.833
doesn't mean we're meant to be together.
Maybe we were never supposed to be.

11:16.927 --> 11:21.762
So if Jack can make it that none of you
ever come here, then he should.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.679
Why are you doing this, Juliet?

11:37.573 --> 11:42.283
lfl never meet you,
then I never have to lose you.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.958
Slow down that drill.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.705
This has got to be...
It can't be like that.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.461
Radzinsky!

11:59.303 --> 12:02.261
- What is it now?
- Gauss readings jumped off the charts.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.013
Let me see.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.886
- This is it. On top of the pocket.
- If we drill and hit that pocket,

12:10.981 --> 12:14.189
- all hell is gonna break loose.
- Radzinsky, are you there? Over.

12:15.152 --> 12:17.939
- Stuart, come in.
- What do you want, Phil?

12:18.030 --> 12:20.396
That Hostile
that shot the kid came back.

12:20.490 --> 12:24.153
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Here at the barracks.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.906
He attacked us and got rescued
by some other recruits.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.955
- They stole a van and took off.
- Took off where?

12:30.042 --> 12:33.159
I don't know.
Roger said one of them had a bomb.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.745
That Hostile knows about the Swan.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.004
Get some men and some guns,
get your asses out here right now!

12:41.094 --> 12:43.301
lfthey're coming here, we'll be ready.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.016
Come on!

12:48.268 --> 12:50.008
Jack?

12:50.646 --> 12:51.681
What happened?

12:54.358 --> 12:56.349
My talk with Sawyer didn't go so good.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.231
- Does it hurt?
- It's OK.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.028
OK.

13:08.997 --> 13:12.330
Do you remember when l sewed you up
when we first got here?

13:12.417 --> 13:14.078
Yeah.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.035
Seems like a million years ago.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.670
Or 30 years from now.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.552
Kate, why did you make me promise
to never ask about Aaron?

13:37.776 --> 13:40.233
Because I was...

13:41.405 --> 13:44.488
...so angry with you
for making me come back here.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.237
Is he why you came back?

13:49.287 --> 13:52.074
I came back so he
could be where he belongs.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.162
- With his mother.
- If this works,

13:56.253 --> 13:59.370
Claire'll never come to the island.
They'll always be together,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.500
- the way they're meant to be.
- She was gonna give him up.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.879
You don't know what she'd do.
And, whatever it is,

14:04.970 --> 14:06.835
it would be her choice.

14:07.305 --> 14:11.014
If you wanna save Claire,
this is the only way to do it.

14:11.601 --> 14:15.719
But nothing... Nothing in my life
has ever felt so right.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.388
And...

14:19.651 --> 14:21.733
...| just need you to believe that.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.914
Keep cooling it! Don't let it get hot!

14:37.210 --> 14:40.702
- Keep the drill going!
- It's about to happen.

14:46.470 --> 14:48.210
Are you with me on this?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.143
- Yes.
- Then let's go.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.321
- ...two, three, four.
- Copy that.

15:13.205 --> 15:14.570
One wallet.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.994
Two hundred and 27 dollars cash.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.085
One ballpoint pen.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.508
One Fruit Roll-Up.

15:26.510 --> 15:29.377
- Sign here.
- You don't understand. It's a mistake.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.340
I killed a bunch of people.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.974
You see this?
This is a discharge form.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.677
You've been cleared.
So take your stuff and go.

15:39.731 --> 15:44.100
Look, dude, there are men
with tranquilizer guns

15:44.194 --> 15:47.436
hunting me down. They want to
bring me somewhere against my will.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.529
There's a cab stand right out front.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.909
- Sorry. I didn't see it was taken.
- I'm only going a few blocks.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.086
- You want to share?
- Cool! You sure?

16:05.173 --> 16:06.674
Come on in.

16:14.558 --> 16:18.142
- You want some? lt's cherry.
- No, thanks.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.639
- What were you in for?
- Excuse me?

16:23.733 --> 16:27.692
Jail. lwas there
'cause I killed three people.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.566
I didn't really.
Guess they figured it out.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.316
- What about you?
- I wasn't in jail.

16:35.829 --> 16:41.074
Then what were you doing
sitting outside a prison in a cab?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.329
l was waiting for you, Hugo.

16:47.215 --> 16:50.673
- Then you must be dead.
- I'm definitely not dead.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.132
What do you want from me?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.761
I wanna know why
you won't go back to the island.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.226
- 'Cause I'm cursed.
- Is that so?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.817
That's why the plane crashed,

17:13.909 --> 17:17.652
my friends died, Libby, Charlie.

17:17.746 --> 17:21.238
Now they visit me,
and I can't make it stop.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.790
What if you weren't cursed?

17:25.837 --> 17:29.079
- What if you were blessed?
- How do you mean, blessed?

17:29.174 --> 17:32.792
Well, you get to talk to
the people you've lost.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.212
- Seems like a wonderful thing to me.
- Sure, it's wonderful

17:37.307 --> 17:41.596
- except for the part where I'm crazy.
- I've got some news for you, Hugo.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.393
You're just gonna have to
take my word on this.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.392
You are not crazy.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.403
- Who are you, dude?
- I'm just up here on the corner.

17:59.788 --> 18:03.747
Ajira Ainlvays, flight 316 out of LAX.
Leaves in 24 hours.

18:03.833 --> 18:08.327
All you have to do is be on that plane.
It's your choice, Hugo.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.796
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

18:16.554 --> 18:20.718
- Wait! You forgot your guitar.
- It's not my guitar.

18:25.063 --> 18:29.853
Don't worry, dude. Everything'll be fine
when Jack changes the future.

18:30.568 --> 18:33.651
Or the past. One of those.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.523
I don't think
your buddy's gonna make it.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.652
He'll make it.

18:40.620 --> 18:44.329
- Dude, what happened to your face?
- Nothing.

18:45.875 --> 18:50.244
We were just up on a ridge where
we could look down into the Swan site.

18:50.338 --> 18:54.126
Something just happened down there.
They hit something.

18:54.676 --> 18:58.168
- It's time for me to go.
- It's all set to go.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.720
Remember, be careful.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.389
lt's rigged to explode on impact.

19:03.476 --> 19:07.310
According to Faraday's plan, you must
get the bomb as close as you can

19:07.397 --> 19:10.230
to the source of electromagnetism.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.896
Sayid, this is gonna work.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.773
And it'll save you.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.273
Nothing can save me.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.874
See you in Los Angeles.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.651
Are you sure you need to do this?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.824
If you waited,
Jacob would come to you, John.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.951
I'm tired of waiting.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.499
Where is he, Richard?

21:01.219 --> 21:04.052
What happened to the rest of the statue?

21:05.765 --> 21:08.222
I don't know.
It was like that when I got here.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.184
Do you expect me to believe that?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.597
Not really.

21:16.526 --> 21:17.891
All right, Ben. Let's go.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.707
What are you doing?

21:33.877 --> 21:36.539
- John wants me to join him.
- You can't bring him in.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.915
- Why not?
- Only our leader can request

21:39.007 --> 21:42.044
an audience with Jacob.
There can only be one leader at a time.

21:42.135 --> 21:46.629
I'm beginning to think you just
make these rules up as you go along.

21:46.723 --> 21:51.433
Ben is coming in with me. lfthat's
a problem, Jacob and I can work it out.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.425
Tell him I said hello.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.628
Will you be able to do this, Ben?

23:04.592 --> 23:09.803
I know it won't be easy,
but things will change once he's gone.

23:15.812 --> 23:16.801
I promise.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.840
- Can I ask you something, LaFleur?
- There ain't no more LaFleur.

23:55.977 --> 23:59.469
- Go ahead, shoot.
- Has it occurred to any of you

23:59.564 --> 24:03.773
that your buddy's actually gonna
cause the thing he's trying to prevent?

24:06.404 --> 24:10.238
Perhaps that little nuke
is the incident.

24:10.658 --> 24:14.321
So maybe the best thing to do
is nothing.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.119
I'm glad you all thought this through.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.627
- What's going on?
- lt's Phil.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.209
That's the road to the Swan.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.761
lfthey see Jack, they'll kill him.

24:35.350 --> 24:37.716
What do you think, blondie?

24:40.730 --> 24:42.937
Live together and die alone.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.442
Still running pretty hot.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.161
- Good for you. You got here fast.
- Any sign of them?

24:59.248 --> 25:00.579
Not yet. You got time
to set up a perimeter.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.660
- Did you call these men to the site?
- You, rear. You, top.

25:04.754 --> 25:09.589
- We need to get people away from here!
- Top of the scaffolding. Go, now!

25:44.377 --> 25:45.833
There!

25:49.298 --> 25:50.708
Go, go, over there!

25:56.597 --> 25:57.882
Get him!

26:00.768 --> 26:02.224
Flank him! Get him now!

26:08.484 --> 26:09.599
Who's this?!

26:49.275 --> 26:52.483
Drop it, Phil, or you're a dead man.
Tell 'em to put the guns down!

26:52.570 --> 26:54.231
Drop the guns! Drop the guns!

26:57.450 --> 26:59.156
You can come out now, doc!

27:07.376 --> 27:09.583
Hurry up and do your business.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.876
Turn that damn thing off!

27:21.015 --> 27:22.380
What's the matter?

27:23.810 --> 27:26.267
- It won't shut down!
- Why not?

27:26.354 --> 27:29.892
- Something's pulling the drill down!
- We hit the pocket!

27:40.493 --> 27:43.405
Hurry up, doc!
What are you waiting for? Drop it!

28:38.551 --> 28:42.510
This don't look like LAX.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.335
Dad!

29:19.967 --> 29:21.173
Jack!

29:31.562 --> 29:35.020
Get away from here!
Get as far away from here as you can!

29:36.734 --> 29:40.522
- Get in! What the hell's going on?
- Let's get out of here!

29:46.702 --> 29:48.112
Go, go, go!

29:56.087 --> 29:58.169
Hey, LaFleur!

30:10.434 --> 30:11.844
- Help!
- Juliet!

30:16.065 --> 30:18.181
Come on! Sawyer, help!

30:18.275 --> 30:19.731
Juliet!

30:33.040 --> 30:35.031
Where do you think you're going?

30:38.629 --> 30:41.871
Kate! Help me get those chains off!

30:45.261 --> 30:47.343
Hold on. You hold on!

30:47.430 --> 30:50.672
- I can't! I can't get it off!
- I got you.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.848
I can't!

30:59.483 --> 31:01.735
- I can't reach her!
- You hold on!

31:07.199 --> 31:08.655
lgotyou.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.696
Sawyer!

31:17.460 --> 31:20.327
- Don't you leave me.
- It's OK.

31:20.421 --> 31:21.752
Don't you leave me!

31:22.965 --> 31:25.172
- I love you!
- No, you don't let go!

31:25.259 --> 31:27.124
- I love you, James.
- No!

31:27.219 --> 31:31.178
- I love you so much!
- No! No, don't let go!

31:32.266 --> 31:35.053
Juliet! No!

32:03.506 --> 32:07.124
- Water?
- Do you have any alcohol?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.467
No. Sure wish I did.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.106
Don't shoot.

32:22.108 --> 32:23.348
It's OK.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.687
It's all right.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.371
Which one of you is Ricardos?

32:45.214 --> 32:46.954
lt's Richard, actually.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.553
What lies in the shadow of the statue?

33:03.774 --> 33:06.937
Richard. l'm llana.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.894
l have something you need to see.

33:11.740 --> 33:13.446
Open it up.

33:13.534 --> 33:15.695
It's OK. It's OK. Let them.

33:47.943 --> 33:51.060
- Where did you find him?
- In the cargo hold of the plane

33:51.155 --> 33:52.270
we came here on.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.743
In a coffin.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.281
I don't understand.

34:04.168 --> 34:08.628
lfthis is Locke, who's in there?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.105
You like it?

35:13.654 --> 35:15.360
I did it myself.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.283
Takes a very long time
when you're making the thread,

35:22.371 --> 35:26.455
but I suppose that's the point,
isn't it?

35:28.377 --> 35:30.038
Hello, Jacob.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.839
You found your loophole.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.217
Indeed I did.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.681
And you have no idea

35:47.771 --> 35:50.353
what I've gone through

35:50.441 --> 35:51.931
to be here.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.822
- Have you met before?
- In a manner of speaking.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.909
Do what I asked you to, Ben.

36:12.296 --> 36:16.960
Benjamin, whatever he's told you,

36:17.051 --> 36:19.417
I want you to understand one thing.

36:22.306 --> 36:24.012
You have a choice.

36:28.270 --> 36:30.010
What choice?

36:30.773 --> 36:34.937
You can do what he asks, or you can go.

36:36.236 --> 36:40.445
Leave us to discuss our... issues.

36:46.121 --> 36:49.454
So now, after all this time,

36:50.876 --> 36:53.709
you've decided to stop ignoring me.

36:56.423 --> 37:00.211
Thirty-five years
I lived on this island.

37:00.302 --> 37:05.672
And all I ever heard was your name,
over and over.

37:05.766 --> 37:10.226
Richard would bring me your
instructions, all those slips of paper.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.598
All those lists.

37:14.024 --> 37:17.437
And I never questioned anything.

37:17.528 --> 37:20.645
I did as l was told.

37:23.033 --> 37:27.402
But when l dared to ask
to see you myself,

37:27.496 --> 37:31.409
l was told, "You have to wait.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.991
You have to be patient."

37:36.255 --> 37:40.089
But when he asked to see you,

37:40.175 --> 37:44.794
he gets marched straight up here
as if he was Moses.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.435
So why him?

38:01.029 --> 38:04.066
What was it that was so wrong with me?

38:09.496 --> 38:11.407
What about me?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.868
What about you?

38:26.889 --> 38:28.220
Well...

38:39.067 --> 38:42.480
- They're coming.
- What?

38:44.698 --> 38:46.234
I can't hear you.

38:46.325 --> 38:48.236
They're coming.

39:10.807 --> 39:15.392
- Juliet!
- Sawyer, get off of there!

39:15.479 --> 39:18.596
You have to come out!

39:21.527 --> 39:24.018
It's going down! This thing is gonna go!

39:24.821 --> 39:28.279
You have to go,
this thing is gonna go at any second.

39:28.367 --> 39:31.154
Jack! Jack, help me get him off of here.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.478
Come on!

40:55.454 --> 40:59.242
Come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
