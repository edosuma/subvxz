00:00.368 --> 00:04.603
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:08.307
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.309 --> 00:10.209
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:11.944
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:11.946 --> 00:15.948
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:15.950 --> 00:17.816
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:17.818 --> 00:22.521
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:26.058
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:29.595
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.530
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:34.266
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.103
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.105 --> 00:39.772
Cat:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:39.774 --> 00:41.573
Maxwell: (On TV)
<i> Forget about Supergirl's</i>
<i> lack of experience,</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:44.243
<i> national city does not need</i>
<i> the problems.</i>

00:44.245 --> 00:46.045
-Who cares what that guy says?
-You do.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.379
Isn't Maxwell lord your hero?

00:47.381 --> 00:48.981
You really don't trust anyone,
do you?

00:48.983 --> 00:50.682
You have no idea.

00:50.684 --> 00:51.750
And your mom?

00:51.752 --> 00:53.519
She is living down
to my expectations

00:53.521 --> 00:56.221
by prioritizing her career
over my own.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.390
-You like Jimmy Olson.
-Stop it.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.659
James, do you have a minute?
I wanted to ask...

01:00.661 --> 01:03.529
-I didn't know you weren't...
-Kara, this is Lucy Lane.

01:03.531 --> 01:07.132
Your dad died working for
a man named Hank henshaw.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.468
We have to find out
what happened to my dad.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.536
Absolutely.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.378
Alex: (On radio) <i> Kara?</i>

01:19.380 --> 01:21.313
What's wrong? Radar picked
you up out over the city?

01:21.315 --> 01:22.748
Is everything okay?

01:22.750 --> 01:25.284
Kara: <i> Fine, just came</i>
<i> to clear my head.</i>

01:25.286 --> 01:27.553
It's peaceful up here.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.754
Relaxing.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.458
Man 1: <i> You cut me off, dude!</i>
Man 2: <i> Shut up!</i>

01:32.460 --> 01:34.626
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.861
Gotta go!

01:36.630 --> 01:38.597
(Engines revving)

01:42.169 --> 01:44.036
Hey! Who taught you to drive?

01:44.038 --> 01:45.604
Go to hell, you piece of...

01:47.808 --> 01:48.874
(Whooshing)

01:49.910 --> 01:51.143
What are you, insane?

01:51.145 --> 01:53.579
-Maniac!
-I just paid this car off!

01:54.348 --> 01:56.248
(Indistinct chattering)

02:00.321 --> 02:02.187
(Glass shattering)

02:03.224 --> 02:05.190
(Supergirl exhales)

02:05.192 --> 02:07.826
-(Kids clapping)
-(Man 1 groaning)

02:09.263 --> 02:10.496
You broke my nose!

02:10.498 --> 02:12.564
Watch where
you're going next time.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.266
You totaled my freaking car!

02:14.268 --> 02:16.468
Before you totaled
all these kids!

02:16.470 --> 02:18.770
You better get out of my face,
you stupid...

02:18.772 --> 02:20.105
(Both grunting)

02:20.107 --> 02:22.107
(Groans)
Argh, you're hurting me!

02:22.109 --> 02:24.176
-(Supergirl gasps)
-(Groans)

02:26.080 --> 02:28.580
(Indistinct chattering)

02:28.582 --> 02:30.415
Newscaster on TV:
<i> Supergirl scares</i>
<i> young children</i>

02:30.417 --> 02:33.218
<i> at a local school.</i>
<i> Road rage and superpowers...</i>

02:33.220 --> 02:34.753
Road rage!

02:35.823 --> 02:37.322
What were you thinking?

02:37.324 --> 02:39.892
They were about to run over
an entire soccer team.

02:39.894 --> 02:42.461
It's always men who go crazy
behind the wheel!

02:42.463 --> 02:44.396
You cannot
lose control like that!

02:44.398 --> 02:46.298
Those two idiots
nearly killed people,

02:46.300 --> 02:47.699
and you're getting mad at me?

02:47.701 --> 02:49.301
That's the thing Ms. danvers,
I am not mad.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.670
I am controlling my anger.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.739
I suggest you get
into the habit.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.543
You know, I once told you,

02:57.545 --> 02:59.745
there are people out there
who fear your cousin.

02:59.747 --> 03:02.147
It's not because
he has god-like powers.

03:02.149 --> 03:05.551
It's because of what
he might do to them
if he ever lost his temper.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.653
(Scoffs)

03:09.757 --> 03:10.956
Woman: Ma'am?

03:12.393 --> 03:14.426
You just might
want to look at this.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.261
Maxwell: (On TV)
<i> I'm just glad these two men</i>
<i> were only in the hospital,</i>

03:16.263 --> 03:17.596
<i> and not the morgue.</i>

03:17.598 --> 03:20.065
<i> We're all so worried</i>
<i> about police brutality,</i>

03:20.067 --> 03:23.402
<i> maybe we ought to put</i>
<i> a body camera on Supergirl.</i>

03:28.909 --> 03:31.777
0930. Have to get to work.

03:31.779 --> 03:35.013
Oh, by the way,
my dad's in town.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.648
(Slurping)

03:36.650 --> 03:38.283
On business.

03:38.285 --> 03:41.153
Plus, he would like
to have dinner with us.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.788
(Clears throat)

03:42.790 --> 03:44.323
I know you think
he doesn't like you,

03:44.325 --> 03:46.858
but you've never really
given him the chance to.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.827
What do you say?
Can I tell him "yes"?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.163
Affirmative.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.431
Thank you, babe.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.700
Hi. To go, please.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.669
-Lucy: See you later.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.870
Oh, hey, Kara!

03:58.872 --> 04:00.606
Thank you so much
for the invite by the way.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.574
I'm really
looking forward to it.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.509
Sure, yeah. Me too...

04:04.511 --> 04:06.678
-(Both chuckle)
-I'll see you there. Bye.

04:16.156 --> 04:17.189
Kara: Everything okay?

04:17.191 --> 04:20.025
Um, yeah...

04:20.027 --> 04:22.194
Lucy's dad's in town.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.695
He's army, like her but, uh...

04:23.697 --> 04:25.664
He and I don't really
get along.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.499
Why not?

04:27.501 --> 04:30.535
Because I consort with aliens.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.839
He somehow thinks
that superman is a threat
to national security.

04:33.841 --> 04:34.840
Hmm.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.441
Yeah, it really makes me
upset sometimes.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.277
But he's Lucy's dad, so...

04:38.279 --> 04:43.115
Speaking of Lucy, she said
she was looking forward to...

04:43.117 --> 04:47.052
Yeah! I meant to mention that.
Um, now that Lucy's in town...

04:47.054 --> 04:48.620
Uh, I hope it's cool with you.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.188
I... I invited her
to game night.

04:50.190 --> 04:53.258
Of course, yeah! Yes.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.193
-The more the merrier.
-Okay.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.962
And who doesn't like
being merry?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.363
(Both chuckling)

04:58.365 --> 05:01.099
Anyway, gotta get back.
I'll see you later.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.501
All right.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.538
Katherine:
All these televisions.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.540
How can you possibly
get any work done

05:08.542 --> 05:10.776
with so much visual noise
assaulting you?

05:10.778 --> 05:14.179
That visual noise
is my work, mother.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.248
That's right, my daughter,
what do they call you?

05:16.250 --> 05:18.850
The proletariat Princess.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.853
Queen of all media, mother.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.856
So, what brings you
to national city?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.024
Book tour.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.261
I edited paget Willoughby's
newest novel.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.662
Well, la-Dee-dah.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.963
Perhaps you'll listen to it

05:31.965 --> 05:34.399
when it comes out
in audio book form.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.070
I'm sure Carter would love
to see you while you're here.

05:38.072 --> 05:39.905
I don't think
I'll have the time, dear.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.608
Did he get the savings bond
I sent him for his birthday?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.143
Hmm.

05:45.145 --> 05:48.113
Yes, he was so excited
he showed it
to all of his friends.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.816
"Supergirl"?

05:50.818 --> 05:53.785
Shouldn't she be
called "superwoman"?

05:53.787 --> 05:56.021
Didn't you read
the article I wrote?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.856
I didn't get a chance.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.859
But the young man sitting
on the plane next to me
had a copy.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.694
It looked like
he read some of it.

06:02.696 --> 06:06.832
So interesting, isn't it?
A woman hero.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.135
I can't help
but feel safer in Metropolis.

06:10.137 --> 06:14.373
Call me old-fashioned but
I still prefer male doctors.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.382
Alex, what are you doing here?

06:24.284 --> 06:26.218
I need to talk about my dad.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.553
We're going to find out
what happened to your dad.
I promise.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.022
But, uh, as you can see...

06:31.024 --> 06:34.259
Today, um, right
this very second...

06:34.261 --> 06:35.861
It's just,
it's not a good time.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.697
Actually, I came
to talk to winn.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.533
Absolutely not!
Are you out of your minds?

06:41.535 --> 06:44.035
Winn, we need your help.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.071
To break into
the deo mainframe?

06:46.073 --> 06:49.207
Uh, that's not help,
that's treason.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.944
-Winn...
-No! No.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.947
No, okay. I'm sorry.
Not even for you, Kara.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.316
For whom
I would do anything...

06:58.318 --> 06:59.584
I...

06:59.586 --> 07:02.354
No! I'm not doing this.

07:02.356 --> 07:04.890
-It's about her dad.
-(Winn sighs)

07:06.260 --> 07:08.760
It's a dirty pool, danvers.
You know I have dad issues.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.030
His name was Jeremiah danvers.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.767
The deo found out
about Kara soon after
she landed on earth.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.504
They threatened to take her
unless my father went
to work for them.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.641
He did.
A year later he was dead.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.709
I need to find out
what really happened to him.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.911
If the deo knows
about your dad,

07:25.913 --> 07:27.579
why don't you
just go ask them?

07:27.581 --> 07:28.914
Because if they wanted
to tell me the truth,

07:28.916 --> 07:30.549
they would have
done it already.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.517
Please?

07:32.519 --> 07:34.719
You're the only one
that can help us.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.561
Okay! Okay, I'm in.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.663
(Cell phone chimes)

07:45.399 --> 07:46.498
Henshaw's calling...

07:46.500 --> 07:47.899
Yeah, me too.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.690
Director henshaw.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.226
General Lane. What can I do
for army intelligence?

08:14.228 --> 08:16.695
I need you to approve
an immediate transfer.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.763
A member of your field unit
to my command.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.665
Really. And who would that be?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.300
The lady in red.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.569
Technically, Supergirl doesn't
work for this organization.

08:24.571 --> 08:26.905
If I had my way, no one would.

08:26.907 --> 08:31.610
Your covert operations could
be handled effectively
with my special forces

08:31.612 --> 08:34.379
and without
foreign assistance.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.814
Why do you need me?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.415
We've been
developing something.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.484
An anti-insurgent
combat device.

08:39.486 --> 08:43.121
Project code named, rt. I need
her help testing it for me.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.422
Lucy: She has no choice.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.259
We have an executive order
forcing you to comply.

08:47.261 --> 08:51.229
My legal attache
and my daughter, major Lane.

08:52.466 --> 08:54.266
It's been signed
by the president.

08:54.268 --> 08:56.635
You can take it up
with her if you like.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.137
Unless you don't think
you're up to it.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.472
I'll do it.

09:00.474 --> 09:01.706
Supergirl, you don't have to.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.375
I agree with agent danvers.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.043
What do you need me to do?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.578
Fight my robot.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.213
Dr. morrow: It's not a robot.

09:10.584 --> 09:14.719
It's an anthropomorphic
pseudo entity
with combat capabilities.

09:15.489 --> 09:17.489
I stand corrected, doctor.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.890
(Beeping)

09:24.364 --> 09:26.765
I call it red tornado.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.733
(Machine powering up)

09:42.716 --> 09:45.116
So, apparently I'm fighting
a robot tomorrow.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.451
Robot?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.520
Wait, what kind of robot
are we talking, like a c3po?

09:48.522 --> 09:49.721
Terminator? Roomba?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.222
Deo testing out a new toy?

09:51.224 --> 09:52.657
Military, actually...

09:52.659 --> 09:54.793
Uh, general Lane
asked for my help.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.995
Even Lucy was there.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.230
Whoa! She didn't
recognize you, did she?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.498
Nope! No.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.768
So that is what her father
is really doing here.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.403
Kara, you can say no to this.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.606
I can't. I have to show her...

10:07.608 --> 10:10.775
Him, that I can
be a team player.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.044
That my cousin
and I can be trusted.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.214
Wait, does the robot fight
mean that game night
is canceled?

10:16.216 --> 10:17.549
No! No!

10:17.551 --> 10:21.386
Game night is the last shred
of normalcy that remains

10:21.388 --> 10:25.156
in our crime stopping,
alien hunting,
deo hacking lives.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.892
Game night survives.
It has to.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.829
Okay, Lucy and I
will see you there.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.570
You, um, you invited Lucy?

10:38.572 --> 10:40.705
He asked.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.774
-Huh.
-It'll be fun.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.779
It will not be fun.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.447
Dinner with your mother is
confirmed for 8:00.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.316
I've reserved a
table right on the beach.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.485
Oh, great, maybe
the roar of the ocean

10:53.487 --> 10:54.986
will drown out
the sound of her voice.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.722
Or maybe it will
just drown her. Or me.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.691
-Kitty, darling.
-Mother.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.026
Let's not get carried away.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.861
We've already seen
each other once today.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.999
You're early, mother.
Dinner isn't until 8:00.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.269
Listen, sweetheart,
there's been a change of plan.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.272
As it turns out,
Toni morrison is in town.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.440
Can you believe it?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.275
Oh! I'm practically shaking.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.111
Anyway, Toni's having
an impromptu
little dinner party

11:20.113 --> 11:22.280
at the house
she's rented in Montecito.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.082
Just a few old friends.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.084
Mother, that is
at least two hours away,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.420
we're going to
have to leave right now.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.288
Oh, dear.

11:30.290 --> 11:35.694
Toni wanted to keep
this an intimate gathering
of close friends.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.495
Oh...

11:37.497 --> 11:40.598
I cleared my evening for you.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.903
Kitty, what could you possibly
have to talk about

11:44.905 --> 11:49.174
with two nobel laureates
and Margaret atwood?

11:50.610 --> 11:52.310
Enjoy your dinner, mother.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.527
Ms. Grant...

12:09.529 --> 12:11.896
Oh, where are the proofs for
the revised fashion spread?

12:11.898 --> 12:14.365
Oh! I have them right here.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.367
Well, thank you.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.605
(Sighs) And no! No!

12:20.607 --> 12:22.440
And no! The filter is off.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.309
This waif model
looks like a wet rat.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.011
Take it back to editing.
The entire thing needs
to be retouched.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.947
And stay there
until it's finished.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.319
I'm sorry. Do you have plans?

12:34.321 --> 12:38.890
It's just this, um,
office game night thing we do.

12:38.892 --> 12:42.060
Office game night?
Ker-rah, really?

12:43.697 --> 12:46.531
Don't you think you've made
enough of a fool of yourself

12:46.533 --> 12:49.100
over James Olsen for one day?

12:49.102 --> 12:51.669
Everyone's noticed
how you throw yourself at him.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.906
You should try
to be a little bit
more professional.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.176
I'll get these
to editing right away.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.515
Okay! I absolutely hate the
texture of this in my mouth.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.283
-Eggplant!
-Yes!

13:05.285 --> 13:08.720
Oh! We've always wanted
to go to this place?

13:08.722 --> 13:10.855
-Machu picchu! Yes!
-Yes!

13:10.857 --> 13:13.691
Uh, "leave the gun.
Take the cannoli."

13:13.693 --> 13:16.094
<i> -The godfather.</i> Yes!
-Yes.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.397
We had an amazing four hours
at this one place in cabo...

13:19.399 --> 13:20.465
Time! Time's up.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.267
(Both chuckling)

13:22.669 --> 13:23.802
Eleven.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.203
Whoo!

13:25.205 --> 13:28.273
Wow, you guys.
You make a really great team.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.009
Oh, it helps when you really
know your partner.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.280
Winn, go!

13:35.282 --> 13:36.781
Oh, yes.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.183
(Clears throat)

13:39.619 --> 13:42.554
Uh, okay, this is, um...

13:42.556 --> 13:45.156
Uh, it's a creature has...
(Straining)

13:45.158 --> 13:47.091
The things on its arms...

13:47.093 --> 13:49.294
-I don't know what...
-Pass.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.862
-(Laughing)
-(Groaning)

13:50.864 --> 13:52.664
Okay, wait...

13:52.666 --> 13:56.301
-No, I have no idea
who or what...
-Go, go, go.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.535
Pass.

13:57.537 --> 14:01.206
Uh, oh! Yeah, this one's easy!
Uh, your cousin.

14:01.208 --> 14:05.476
Roger... sultan... fuss...
Really likes this guy.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.878
-Pass.
-Lucy: Time!

14:06.880 --> 14:08.913
Okay, I want to know
what that was.

14:08.915 --> 14:10.982
-Oh, don't...
-Ooh! Superman?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.952
You should have just
said Jimmy Olsen's
special boyfriend?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.321
(Laughing)

14:16.323 --> 14:19.524
I met his little
cousin today. Supergirl.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.792
Wow!

14:20.794 --> 14:21.993
-You... you did?
-Yeah.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.028
I wasn't that impressed.

14:24.030 --> 14:28.066
It's like when you see
a movie star in person
and you're like, "is that it?"

14:28.068 --> 14:29.467
(Fading) I guess that's it.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.404
Plus, she's totally
not your type.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.082
I don't say this often,
but I am craving
a good fight right now.

14:44.084 --> 14:47.085
But just keep your cool.
You got this.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.299
I got $20 on the android.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.101
(Scoffs) Forty on the alien.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.737
If at any point I don't like
what I'm seeing,
I'm ending this.

15:05.739 --> 15:10.608
Which I would completely
understand, if you had
any authority over me.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.478
Dr. morrow. You can begin.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.479
Thank you, general.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.681
-(Beeping)
-(Machine powering up)

15:18.952 --> 15:21.152
(Beeping)

15:23.323 --> 15:24.656
(Whirring)

15:34.467 --> 15:36.034
(Groaning)

15:36.036 --> 15:39.003
Maybe she's not taking
this seriously.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.259
(Whooshing)

16:05.932 --> 16:07.565
(Grunting)

16:14.774 --> 16:17.141
(Grunting)

16:17.143 --> 16:19.210
It's experiencing
system damage.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.813
The test is over.
Pull the plug. Now.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.548
Supergirl. You won.

16:23.550 --> 16:25.316
(Screaming)

16:26.653 --> 16:28.619
(Crackling)

16:28.621 --> 16:31.356
Supergirl, stand down.
That's enough.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.324
(Panting)

16:38.531 --> 16:40.064
(Whooshing)

16:41.468 --> 16:42.967
(Huffing)

16:42.969 --> 16:45.003
-Alex: Are you hurt?
-No.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.840
She must have triggered
his emergency
self-preservation function.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.375
I can't see it.

16:50.377 --> 16:54.178
He's in stealth mode,
making him 100% undetectable.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.080
This is your fault.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.415
You asked me to fight it.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.717
And now your recklessness
has unleashed

16:59.719 --> 17:03.621
an uncontrollable killing
machine on national city.

17:15.535 --> 17:20.238
A billion dollar investment,
eleven years of R&D,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.041
and what do we have?
A paper weight.

17:23.977 --> 17:26.144
I want this thing found
and destroyed

17:26.146 --> 17:29.547
before it turns national city
into a war zone.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.982
Destroy it?

17:30.984 --> 17:33.117
You can't do that.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.154
The last thing the army needs
is a bunch of wounded
civilians on the 9:00 news.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.390
I've invested too much time
and effort into this...

17:39.392 --> 17:42.160
Into what, morrow?

17:44.364 --> 17:46.831
The red tornado failed.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.400
And so did you. You're fired.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.310
Cat: Ker-rah!

18:01.347 --> 18:02.580
Ker-rah!

18:06.386 --> 18:07.752
Ker-rah!

18:07.754 --> 18:09.353
Yes, yes, I'm here!

18:09.355 --> 18:10.455
Finally!

18:11.524 --> 18:13.858
I have been screaming
your name over and over

18:13.860 --> 18:15.426
for the past
minute and a half.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.863
Ninety seconds I have been
boiling alive in my office.

18:18.865 --> 18:22.467
Ninety seconds, each one
of which, if amortized to
reflect my earnings,

18:22.469 --> 18:25.303
is worth more than
your yearly salary.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.106
One second of my time
is 90 times more valuable

18:28.108 --> 18:30.041
than your pointless,
sad, pathetic...

18:30.043 --> 18:32.243
Don't talk to me like that!
Please!

18:32.946 --> 18:36.013
I work so hard for you!

18:36.015 --> 18:37.815
I don't ask questions,
I don't complain,

18:37.817 --> 18:40.551
and all you do
is yell at me and tell me
I'm not good enough.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.652
And it's mean!

18:41.654 --> 18:43.621
Why are you so mean?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.965
Oh, my god! I'm...

18:54.534 --> 18:56.667
I'm so sorry.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.269
I didn't mean that.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.505
(Stammering) I don't know
what happened. I just snapped.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.672
(Shushing)

19:03.977 --> 19:05.910
Forward the phones.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.380
We're going.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.916
Where are we going?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.085
Chop chop.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.128
Nice to see you,
agent danvers.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.664
What can I do for the FBI?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.534
Hope no one's trying
to kill me again. (Chuckles)

19:29.536 --> 19:32.136
I'm not certain someone was
trying to kill you last time.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.572
Ah, you've been
talking to Supergirl.

19:34.574 --> 19:38.242
Poor thing. I think
she's got her facts confused.

19:38.244 --> 19:39.710
I'm not the bad guy.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.580
Then prove it.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.022
Loving the color.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.723
May I?

19:58.131 --> 20:00.398
The edging
on the break is brittle...

20:00.400 --> 20:04.936
The kind of fracturing that
would occur if the surface
reached absolute zero.

20:04.938 --> 20:08.773
Like after being subjected
to Supergirl's freeze breath.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.841
(Blows softly and chuckles)

20:10.843 --> 20:14.245
I didn't realize
the maiden of might
was on the fibbies payroll.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.113
It's from an army android.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.849
It's gone rogue,

20:18.851 --> 20:20.384
and I need
your help to find it.

20:20.386 --> 20:23.387
What makes you think I can?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.724
I know you don't trust
the government after what
happened to your parents.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.460
But this thing is dangerous.

20:29.462 --> 20:33.030
And if you want to prove to me
that you're not the bad guy,

20:33.032 --> 20:35.032
then help me
find the real one.

20:38.571 --> 20:43.074
It was good seeing you again,
agent danvers.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.078
But I'm kinda busy here.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.060
-Scotch. Neat.
-Same.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.029
I'll just a club soda.
Thank you.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.865
"Never trust a man
who doesn't drink

21:07.867 --> 21:10.601
"because he's probably
a self-righteous sort,

21:10.603 --> 21:14.739
"a man who thinks
he knows right from
wrong all the time."

21:14.741 --> 21:16.340
No inference intended, Jimmy.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.043
Just reminded me
of a quote from one
of my favorite authors.

21:19.579 --> 21:20.845
Aw, Jane Austen?

21:20.847 --> 21:22.246
James crumley.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.119
I'm going to go
powder my nose.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.223
Play nice.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.329
I was surprised to hear

21:38.331 --> 21:40.398
that you and Lucy
were back together.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.434
Surprised or disappointed?

21:43.436 --> 21:46.704
General, I know
what you're really doing
in national city.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.139
Red tornado.

21:49.275 --> 21:50.941
My daughter would
never divulge

21:50.943 --> 21:53.377
classified military
information to a civilian,

21:53.379 --> 21:55.212
not even her boyfriend.

21:55.214 --> 21:58.182
Which means you're
in contact with Supergirl.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.417
First of all,
you don't like me

21:59.419 --> 22:01.319
because I'm friends
with superman,

22:01.321 --> 22:02.820
and now because
I know Supergirl?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.890
That is not why I don't want
you seeing Lucy.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.258
Then what is it?

22:07.260 --> 22:09.427
You're not good enough
for her.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.064
Excuse me?

22:13.066 --> 22:15.700
Jimmy, I love my daughter.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.335
She's my little girl,

22:17.337 --> 22:19.403
and I'll always look out
for her.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.272
She has a bright future.

22:21.274 --> 22:22.707
And I do not want
to see her

22:22.709 --> 22:24.842
miss the incredible heights
she is capable of

22:24.844 --> 22:28.012
because she's invested
too much time and energy

22:28.014 --> 22:30.614
in a glorified paparazzo.

22:30.616 --> 22:34.652
You Ally yourself with people
you think are special.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.321
But that doesn't
make you special.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.124
And I think you know that.

22:44.464 --> 22:46.864
-Everything good?
-Let's order.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.046
Um...

23:02.048 --> 23:04.615
Here's the thing, Kara,

23:04.617 --> 23:07.618
everybody gets angry.
Everybody.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.355
And there is no pill
that will eradicate
this particular emotion.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.625
I know this because
if there were such a pill

23:14.627 --> 23:16.794
I would be popping
those babies like pez.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.729
Miss Grant, uh...

23:18.731 --> 23:20.164
I'm so sorry. I'm...

23:20.166 --> 23:22.533
-Really sorry about...
-You apologize too much,

23:22.535 --> 23:26.237
which is a separate,
although not unrelated,
problem.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.539
No, this is about work.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.142
And anger.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.543
Whatever you do,

23:32.545 --> 23:35.846
you cannot get angry at work.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.116
Especially when you're a girl.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.119
Oh, thank you.
I'm actually still working
on my first one.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.221
Mmm. Did you want another one?

23:48.928 --> 23:51.328
When I was working at
the <i> daily planet,</i>

23:51.330 --> 23:55.466
Perry white picked up a chair
and he threw it out
of the window,

23:55.468 --> 23:56.767
because somebody
missed a deadline.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.470
And no he didn't
open the window first.

23:59.472 --> 24:02.139
If I had thrown a chair,
or, my god,

24:02.141 --> 24:04.675
if I had thrown a napkin,

24:04.677 --> 24:06.544
it would have been
all over the papers.

24:06.546 --> 24:09.680
It would have been
professional
and cultural suicide.

24:09.682 --> 24:13.117
-Then what do you do?
-Well, you need to find
a release.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.052
You need to...

24:15.054 --> 24:17.788
Take up some boxing
or start screaming
at your housekeeper.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.390
But the real key Kara,

24:19.392 --> 24:22.092
is that you need to
figure out what's
really bothering you.

24:22.094 --> 24:26.263
For example, I am so
furious with my mother,
so I took it out on you.

24:26.265 --> 24:30.768
And you are so mad
at me, but... and this is
the important bit,

24:32.705 --> 24:35.306
you weren't really mad at me.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.176
Actually, I kind of was.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.444
No.

24:40.847 --> 24:41.946
Uh-uh.

24:41.948 --> 24:45.583
You were really mad,
at something else.

24:45.585 --> 24:48.853
You need to find,
find that anger

24:48.855 --> 24:51.889
behind the anger.

24:51.891 --> 24:55.326
And you need to
figure out what is really
making you mad.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.199
Thank you for dinner, dad.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.801
My pleasure.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.136
(Chuckles)

25:06.138 --> 25:08.038
(Red tornado hovering)

25:12.078 --> 25:13.344
(Watch clicks)

25:20.820 --> 25:22.887
(Crowd screaming)

25:26.025 --> 25:27.224
(Groans)

25:27.226 --> 25:28.893
Lucy!

25:28.895 --> 25:32.530
I order you to
disengage immediately.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.605
(Grunts)
I'm not gonna let you
hurt them!

25:43.242 --> 25:44.675
(Grunting)

27:11.597 --> 27:12.997
Well, nothing's broken.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.632
She's lucky.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.501
You saved my life. Thank you.

27:17.503 --> 27:21.138
-Of course.
-You let that thing get away.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.340
I thought you were on
our side.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.477
I tried.

27:26.479 --> 27:29.346
It fought harder
this time, faster.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.915
Like it learned
a thing or two
from the last go.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.718
It's like it knew
you'd choose to
save those people.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.287
The tornado was
just a diversion to get away.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.490
He used your humanity
against you.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.760
And now more innocent humans
could be in danger.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.096
If anything else happens,
you and the deo

27:46.098 --> 27:47.731
will both be held accountable.

27:47.733 --> 27:50.134
That's enough, general.

27:53.773 --> 27:56.774
My team analyzed
red tornado's
dermal covering.

27:56.776 --> 28:00.411
It's made of a biosynthetic
polymer which contains
traces of lead.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.746
To suppress
X-ray vision, right?

28:02.748 --> 28:04.515
The android wasn't
meant to fight insurgents.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.717
It was designed to kill
Kryptonians.

28:06.719 --> 28:11.255
You've got fort rozz aliens
locked up downstairs.

28:11.257 --> 28:14.091
Monsters. Abominations.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.560
Some of them have wings.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.929
Some have horns.

28:18.931 --> 28:21.799
And others spit acid.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.135
Do you know the difference
between them and her?

28:25.738 --> 28:27.304
She's blonde.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.540
She saved you
and your daughter, tonight.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.075
You don't owe her
fear and contempt.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.543
You owe her a thank you.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.860
Maxwell lord just called.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.730
Said he saw you on the news
fighting red tornado.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.465
He wants to talk to me.

28:57.670 --> 28:59.770
Agent danvers.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.939
You look beautiful.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.842
You want my help?
I wanna know
who I'm working with.

29:05.611 --> 29:06.677
Please.

29:12.585 --> 29:15.753
I am just someone
trying to help you.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.288
We have that in common.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.325
You seem to only help people
if it helps you.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.560
I've seen what happens
to the selfless.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.765
-Your parents?
-It cost them their lives.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.303
My father died on the job.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.708
I don't know why
I just told you that.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.345
My condolences.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.614
What did he do?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.618
What I do.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.719
How did he die?

29:50.189 --> 29:51.789
I don't know.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.658
I'm trying to find out.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.496
The android isn't
acting alone.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.100
What?

30:03.102 --> 30:04.701
The arm you showed me today.

30:04.703 --> 30:07.437
It's beautiful but in
a rudimentary sense,

30:07.439 --> 30:08.939
a drone.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.375
With an incredibly advanced
GPS system.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.644
What are you saying?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.946
You're looking for
Frankenstein's monster.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.715
You should be looking for
Dr. Frankenstein.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.820
Morrow is still
controlling it.

30:22.822 --> 30:23.921
(Clicks tongue)

30:25.991 --> 30:27.758
-Thank you.
-Any time.

30:28.828 --> 30:29.893
Alex.

30:40.773 --> 30:42.172
Wow!

30:42.174 --> 30:45.442
I thought rocky balboa
practicing on dead cows
was cool.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.312
Well, I can't exactly join
a kickboxing class.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.613
(Chuckles)

30:49.615 --> 30:51.748
You know, I never really
noticed Clark

30:51.750 --> 30:54.818
-having to get his rage on.
-'Cause he's a man.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.254
Girls are taught to smile
and keep it on the inside.

30:57.256 --> 31:00.290
Well, it's not like
black men are encouraged
to be angry in public.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.826
Well, then this'll work
for both of us.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.331
Um...

31:08.033 --> 31:10.834
Okay. So...

31:10.836 --> 31:14.304
Say what you're mad
about and then
let the fists fly.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.306
Okay.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.548
I can't stand Lucy's dad.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.450
I can't stand him either.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.486
I hate how he gets involved
in our relationship,

31:29.488 --> 31:32.189
and I'm not holding Lucy back.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.191
I can't stand the way
cat treats me.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.926
(Grunting)

31:35.928 --> 31:38.695
And I really cannot stand
how he talks about
your cousin!

31:38.697 --> 31:42.532
I hate how my emotions
get the best of me.

31:42.534 --> 31:46.603
And I hate how
my sister doesn't know
what happened to her father.

31:46.605 --> 31:50.974
And I hate that
I am never gonna get to
have a normal life!

31:50.976 --> 31:52.042
(Grunting)

31:58.017 --> 31:59.116
Kara...

31:59.118 --> 32:00.517
Oh, my god...

32:01.220 --> 32:03.620
Cat was right.

32:03.622 --> 32:07.457
There is anger
behind the anger.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.494
Are there like extra emotions
that I don't know
about it in Krypton?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.663
No, no, I thought...

32:13.666 --> 32:15.966
I thought I was mad
seeing you...

32:21.440 --> 32:22.873
Seeing you and Lucy
makes me think

32:22.875 --> 32:25.642
that I am never gonna have
what you two have.

32:26.812 --> 32:29.379
Someone who knows
everything about me.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.981
(Inhales)

32:30.983 --> 32:34.584
My perfect partner
at a game night.

32:34.586 --> 32:35.919
Kara, you'll find someone...

32:35.921 --> 32:38.655
Growing up on earth,
I never felt normal.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.258
And I always thought that if
I started to use my powers,

32:41.260 --> 32:43.226
my life would make sense.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.495
But I'm realizing that...

32:45.497 --> 32:48.065
Being myself doesn't
make me feel more normal.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.201
And it never will.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.603
Because my normal life,

32:53.605 --> 32:56.940
ended the second
my parents
put me on that ship.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.041
And that makes me...

32:59.144 --> 33:00.410
...so...

33:01.113 --> 33:02.379
...mad.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.423
(Phone ringing)

33:16.228 --> 33:19.730
-Hey!
-Alex: <i> I found something,</i>
<i> meet me back at the deo.</i>

33:21.200 --> 33:22.466
Right.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.434
I have to go.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.113
Thanks to Maxwell lord,

33:36.115 --> 33:38.382
we know Dr. morrow is still
controlling red tornado.

33:38.384 --> 33:40.250
That's why it's targeting
general Lane.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.053
Morrow wants revenge on Lane
for mothballing his project.

33:43.055 --> 33:46.123
So, if we take out Dr. morrow,
we take out red tornado.

33:46.125 --> 33:49.426
So, how do we find
this morrow?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.395
We draw out the android.

33:51.397 --> 33:55.332
Then we trace the relay signal
Dr. morrow's using to control
it back to Dr. morrow.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.869
Kara,
keep red tornado occupied
until I can shut it down.

34:00.906 --> 34:02.305
Think you can keep your cool
this time?

34:02.307 --> 34:04.541
I'm not afraid
of my anger anymore.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.043
I can use it.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.278
Channel it to work for me,
not against me.

34:09.848 --> 34:12.449
General Lane.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.886
I think we may have
a solution that will rectify
your screw up.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.187
But I'll need your help...

34:19.892 --> 34:21.191
-(Beeping)
-Signal's in.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.060
I have a position on morrow.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.104
How did you manage to project

35:07.106 --> 35:10.040
a thermally accurate
3D hologram of me

35:10.042 --> 35:11.741
over 70 miles away?

35:11.743 --> 35:14.544
Technology from
those Kryptonians
you're so scared of.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.081
(Gun firing)

35:27.893 --> 35:29.526
I think I got its attention.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.604
Dr. morrow:
That won't do anything.

35:40.606 --> 35:44.541
Telepathic relay interface,
to control his
cerebral matrix.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.944
If you want to stop him,
you'll have to cease any

35:47.946 --> 35:50.247
neural function
from his creator.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.582
You'll have to kill me.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.951
You don't have to throw your
life away...

35:54.953 --> 35:57.053
The red tornado is my life.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.282
(Grunting)

36:32.624 --> 36:33.957
(Grunting)

36:46.638 --> 36:47.704
(Both grunting)

36:51.877 --> 36:53.143
(Gun fires)

36:59.685 --> 37:01.051
(Panting)

37:03.889 --> 37:05.155
(Gasping)

37:08.894 --> 37:10.160
You did it.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.732
It's still going.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.100
Supergirl: <i> It's still going.</i>

37:17.102 --> 37:18.368
Agent danvers.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.038
No commands are being
transmitted to the android.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.608
Kara, it's become sentient.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.044
(Grunting)

37:57.276 --> 37:58.608
(Inaudible screaming)

38:16.628 --> 38:17.794
(Exploding)

38:23.869 --> 38:26.269
Supergirl, are you okay?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.575
I'm here. I'm...

38:33.278 --> 38:34.811
(Panting) I'm okay...

38:35.847 --> 38:37.380
It's over.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.328
I have a car waiting to take
us to the airport, Lucy.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.864
We have a flight back to
Metropolis at 1900 hours.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.132
No more orders, dad.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.168
I'm not coming with you.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.170
And I'm not working
for you anymore.

39:00.172 --> 39:01.738
I'm resigning my commission.

39:04.576 --> 39:08.845
I know you think James
is somehow holding me back.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.380
But it is not true.

39:10.382 --> 39:12.716
He's fighting for the same
things, I am.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.718
We are on the same team.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.886
That's why I'm staying.

39:21.727 --> 39:25.195
I hope that one day
when you realize

39:25.197 --> 39:27.364
what a terrible mistake
you've made,

39:28.767 --> 39:30.233
it won't be too late.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.340
(Sighs)

39:42.314 --> 39:44.481
You're my hero.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.383
I'll try not to let that
go to my head.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.492
Hey.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.295
What's going on?

39:59.297 --> 40:00.897
Did you find something?

40:00.899 --> 40:02.766
Um, Alex, you might
want to sit down.

40:05.971 --> 40:08.138
Winn, tell her.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.907
Yeah, um,
so it took some digging,

40:10.909 --> 40:15.111
but I, I located
a file on your father's death.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.080
Most of it was redacted.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.116
Basically he and another agent
went to south America

40:20.118 --> 40:22.886
to apprehend a hostile alien.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.921
It... it didn't go well.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.824
Um, both your father and
the other agent disappeared.

40:27.826 --> 40:30.894
I mean they were both
presumed dead,

40:30.896 --> 40:32.128
until...

40:32.130 --> 40:33.730
Until?

40:33.732 --> 40:38.902
About a month later
the other agent
mysteriously showed up.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.670
Not a scratch on him.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.440
He claims he doesn't remember
anything that happened.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.846
Alex, it was Hank.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.848
These redacted files have
his digital signature.

40:51.850 --> 40:55.285
He is the one
who deleted them.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.520
Why would he delete the files?

41:00.692 --> 41:04.060
Because he's hiding something.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.429
Because maybe the man
that I've been working with

41:06.431 --> 41:09.165
for the last two years
killed my father.

41:09.167 --> 41:12.402
All we do know
is that Hank henshaw

41:12.404 --> 41:15.004
was the last person
to see your father alive.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.553
There she is!

41:30.555 --> 41:32.555
My car was
supposed to be here
half an hour ago.

41:32.557 --> 41:35.391
Oh! I... I didn't realize
I was getting you one.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.027
How else am I supposed
to get to the airport?

41:38.029 --> 41:42.665
Honestly, kitty,
is this creature of yours
some sort of unpaid intern?

41:42.667 --> 41:46.002
How do you justify
paying a salary to such
an unreliable person?

41:50.275 --> 41:54.277
First of all,
I don't pay her very much.

41:54.279 --> 41:57.747
And second,
you don't get to talk
to her that way.

41:57.749 --> 41:59.716
-Excuse me?
-I understand, mother,

41:59.718 --> 42:01.584
that you have always
been threatened

42:01.586 --> 42:05.021
by my success and
you try to elevate yourself
by denigrating me.

42:05.023 --> 42:08.224
Which is fine.
But you are not allowed to do
the same thing to my assistant

42:08.226 --> 42:11.027
who, by the way,
is excellent at her job.

42:15.367 --> 42:17.367
I think...

42:17.369 --> 42:19.502
I'll use the ladies
before I go.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.911
(Sighs)

42:27.913 --> 42:32.682
Thank you for saying
I'm excellent at my job.

42:32.684 --> 42:36.219
-It made me feel normal.
-It was just for effect.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.487
Get me advil.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.789
Here.

42:41.993 --> 42:43.793
Thank you.

42:43.795 --> 42:47.530
(Sighs)
Would you like me
to call your mother a car?

42:47.532 --> 42:49.399
She can take her broom.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.607
-(Glass cracking)
-(Both gasping)

42:57.609 --> 42:59.876
-Sorry, that was my fault.
-Be careful, you might
cut yourself.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.411
I'm fine, I'm fine.

43:02.447 --> 43:05.081
Oh! I told you to be careful.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.753
Are you all right?

43:13.925 --> 43:15.592
I'm bleeding.
