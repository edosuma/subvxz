And now an update

00:06.240 --> 00:07.308
on the
Ernie Krevitt scandal.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.377
Krevitt bilked billions
from his affluent clients,

00:09.410 --> 00:11.612
and is currently serving
the first of his 132

00:11.645 --> 00:13.614
consecutive life
sentences.

00:13.647 --> 00:16.050
After diligent work
by forensic accountants,

00:16.084 --> 00:17.251
to find money
in tax shelters

00:17.285 --> 00:19.253
including the Swiss
municipality, Zug.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.155
Krevitt will now begin
paying restitution

00:21.189 --> 00:22.223
to his swindled clients.

00:22.256 --> 00:25.059
Major investors can expect
a return of 60 cents

00:25.093 --> 00:25.826
on the dollar.

00:25.859 --> 00:26.894
- Wow.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.429
- I don't know what my mother
will be happier about.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.397
Getting some of
her money back

00:29.430 --> 00:32.100
or finishing jury duty.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.101
- Kids!

00:33.134 --> 00:34.102
- I mean it's one thing
to do your civic duty

00:34.135 --> 00:36.170
but what are the odds
of getting sequestered?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.139
- 1 in 2700?

00:38.172 --> 00:39.073
- It's like the only thing

00:39.107 --> 00:40.841
that could have gotten
her out of our house.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.143
Maybe there's something
to be said

00:42.176 --> 00:43.611
for divine intervention
after all.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.147
- Ha ha ha, maybe!

00:46.180 --> 00:47.415
Okay so
the kids' schedules-

00:47.448 --> 00:48.282
- Honey, I got this.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.184
You focus on your
show and becoming

00:50.218 --> 00:51.619
the next wunderkind
of the art world.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.122
- You mean
wundercorpse, I'm 42.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.223
- Well, at least it'll be

00:55.256 --> 00:56.457
a totally different day
for you, hon.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.226
You'll get to have wine
with lunch!

00:58.259 --> 00:59.427
Make fun of
pretentious people!

00:59.460 --> 01:03.131
Wear something vaguely
sado-masochistic.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.266
Okay. So maybe not
totally different.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.267
- Okay, lunches are packed.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.636
Hazel and Miles have
playdates after school.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.304
I have a sitter
picking up Dottie

01:10.338 --> 01:12.173
and running her to
handwriting therapy.

01:12.206 --> 01:14.842
So all you have to do
is drop them off at school,

01:14.875 --> 01:17.278
after which I'm sure
you'll get a full parade

01:17.311 --> 01:19.113
for being a hands-on-dad.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.414
- You're exaggerating
as always.

01:20.448 --> 01:23.217
And I love you
and I will see you later

01:23.251 --> 01:25.353

you say that,

- It's been done
to death.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.677

So I thought,

06:16.710 --> 06:19.547
do I want to give the destitute
a way out of poverty,

06:19.580 --> 06:22.783

06:22.816 --> 06:25.486

no-brainer.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.991

06:31.024 --> 06:33.193
- I need to be rescued!

06:33.226 --> 06:35.429
It's like these women have
better benefits than I do,

06:35.463 --> 06:36.764
and it feels like they
are more appreciated.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.000
- Ultimately the message
behind ProvideHer

make a bag.

motivating Von Weber's

06:45.806 --> 06:47.675

initiative?

06:47.708 --> 06:51.011
- Well I myself recently
fell on some hard times

06:51.044 --> 06:54.782
and I had to pull myself
up by my purse straps.

06:54.815 --> 06:58.486
And in that struggle,
I felt myself marching

06:58.519 --> 07:00.788
with women all
over the world.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.656
- You did the
Women's March!

07:02.690 --> 07:07.661
- Yeah, so symbolically.
- Oh.

07:07.695 --> 07:11.565
- Uh, this is the very
first bag of the line.

07:11.599 --> 07:15.569
It was handcrafted by a

07:18.839 --> 07:20.741
Damn elephants.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.642
- Given your message,

07:21.675 --> 07:23.477
aren't these bags a
little bit pricey?

07:23.511 --> 07:24.512
- Well-

07:24.545 --> 07:26.614
- At Von Weber, we
believe that price is what-

07:26.647 --> 07:29.817
- During the crisis, other
brands slashed their prices,

07:29.850 --> 07:31.719
but at Von Weber
we have a saying,

07:31.752 --> 07:34.755
"When they go low,
we go high."

07:34.788 --> 07:35.623
- I came up with that.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.825
- I'm absolutely
positive you did not.

- No I mean,
in this context.

07:52.873 --> 07:59.046
simultaneously rendering him
impotent as an individual.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.113
- Jill.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.617

- So you're stripping
them naked to kind of

08:26.940 --> 08:30.811
further humiliate them or to
exploit your power over them?

08:30.844 --> 08:31.845

It's a funny

don't just want

It's a thing.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.940
Now tell me about it.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.307

09:50.991 --> 09:52.960
You're like a walking
Ron Howard movie.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.895
- I'm Daryl Hannah
in "Splash."

09:54.928 --> 09:58.832
A fish out of water.
[mimics dolphin]

09:58.866 --> 09:59.733
- Stop.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.335
- I just watched two
men moved to tears

10:02.369 --> 10:03.804
over a video installation
of a naked woman

10:03.837 --> 10:05.906
eating bologna playing
with an abacus.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.809
- Ugh, go Foucault
yourselves, people.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.979
- I have made a small fortune
turning literal bird shit

10:12.012 --> 10:14.848
into the must-have
facial of the moment.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.719
All you need is a crash course
in talking the talk.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.054
Let's take a lap?
Come on.

10:21.088 --> 10:25.726
[upbeat music]

10:25.759 --> 10:27.127
- Okay, tell us what
you see.

10:27.160 --> 10:32.132
- I see Dottie's Mother's Day
gift circa 2014.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.002
- Okay, try,
try a paradox like,

10:35.035 --> 10:38.371
"it personifies the
ecstasy of decay."

10:38.405 --> 10:41.174
- Yeah, dig deep into your
colon and pull out

10:41.208 --> 10:42.876
the bullshit.

10:42.910 --> 10:45.913
Trust me.
I'm a doctor.

10:45.946 --> 10:49.883
- I see...um,
a black hole

10:49.917 --> 10:51.952
where my lifelong
dream used to be.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.889
- Jill, clearly this is a
comment on class.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.158
It is only on the backs of the
working men and women

10:58.191 --> 11:00.393
that the elite
can thrive.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.796
And yet our
economy ensures

11:02.830 --> 11:05.799
they remain an
invisible majority.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.034
- So sad.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.939
- If you think
this is profound,

11:11.972 --> 11:14.775
you must see
Jill Weber's work.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.844
She's a savant
of observation.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.880
Totally amazedicks.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.182
- Are you
getting it?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.051
- I think so.

11:24.084 --> 11:27.020
Okay, let's look
at this piece.

11:27.054 --> 11:27.888
There's such beauty

11:27.921 --> 11:30.423
in its obsequious search
for its owner.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.193
Nobility in
its proud solitude.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.864
- By George, I think
she's got it.

11:37.097 --> 11:37.865
- How fitting.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.933
My commentary
on the human condition

11:39.967 --> 11:41.902
is an actual garbage can.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.236
- Let's try another one.

11:43.270 --> 11:47.207
[rock music diminuendos]

11:47.240 --> 11:49.076
- This is delicious.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.011
- I remember when I
made my first one.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.146
- Mm.
- It was for my father.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.115
I was six.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.084
- Is your father
still with us?

11:57.117 --> 11:58.919
- Sadly, no.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.221
- Oh, I'm sorry.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.223
- Hey, we all
gotta eat, right?

12:03.256 --> 12:05.425
Sharks are people too.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.128
Anyway, enough about me,
what's your story?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.197
- I'm a retired
city planner.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.965
- Hm.
- Fourth generation.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.102
Between my family
and a handful of others

12:18.972 --> 12:21.474

- Whoa, cool.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.244
- 400 years ago,
where you're sitting

12:24.277 --> 12:28.281
there was nothing but
marshland and trees.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.984
- You could look
outside the window

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
and just see
a velociraptor

12:33.120 --> 12:36.256
cruising by
the Freedom Tower.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.324
- Well, not exactly-

12:37.357 --> 12:39.059
- It's just like the
Counting Crows always said,

12:39.092 --> 12:40.260
"They paved paradise

12:40.293 --> 12:43.931
and they put up
a parking lot."

12:43.964 --> 12:47.267
- Oh God. Oh God.
Um okay guys, um.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.468
There's no more beer

12:48.501 --> 12:51.071
but there's still water
if you're thirsty!

12:51.104 --> 12:52.940
[bar patrons boo]
- You suck!

12:52.973 --> 12:54.241
- All right.
Back off everybody.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.944
We're all in here just
trying our best.

12:56.977 --> 12:57.610
- I changed the keg.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.912
I don't know
what happened.

13:01.514 --> 13:06.286
- Once, at our annual Golf Pros
and Tennis Hoes Party,

13:06.319 --> 13:11.892
a pledge brought an import
keg with a domestic tap.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.160
- What did you do?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.295
- Well, I made him shit
his pants and then

13:15.328 --> 13:17.998
paint his face with it.

13:18.031 --> 13:22.169
The Greek system is
all about building character.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.337

give it a shot.

[lively rock music]

13:43.991 --> 13:46.126
- Are you trying to
sabotage me?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.995
- Of course not.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.329
If you need something,
let me know

13:49.362 --> 13:51.064
and I'll let
someone else know.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.332
I just think
it is so important

13:52.365 --> 13:53.333
that we give
this interview

13:53.366 --> 13:55.002
our undivided attention.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.169
- Enough with the "we".

13:56.203 --> 13:58.005
There is no "we"
in Von Weber.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.340
- Quite literally there is.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.142
- It's not a
collective "we,"

14:02.175 --> 14:03.276
it's more of
a royal one.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.979
- Brooke, I am capable of
a lot more than you think.

14:06.013 --> 14:08.081
It's time you started
to recognize that.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.282
- Now is not that time.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.051
Today is about
Brooke von Weber

14:11.084 --> 14:12.552
not Devon von Devon.

14:12.585 --> 14:15.088
- The last six years have
been about Brooke Weber.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.156
- When I first hired you,

14:16.189 --> 14:19.126
you lived in a fourth floor
walk up in Astoria.

14:19.159 --> 14:21.995
- I still live there!

14:22.029 --> 14:22.996
Brooke, I love you,

14:23.030 --> 14:25.598
but it is getting cold here
in your shadow.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.135
I need to know
I have a future with you-

14:28.168 --> 14:31.104
- And I need you to do
what I hired you to do.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.105
Period.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.374
That is how "we" work.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.242
- Noted.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.243
- Hm.
- Hm.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.012
- Is that a dick pic?

14:40.647 --> 14:41.681
- I'm Bronwyn.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.384
- Pleased to meet you,
I'm Jill Weber, the artist.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.219
- So you are.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.355
Tell me about your work.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.123
We'll see if you
live up to the hype.

14:58.131 --> 14:58.932
- Like these men,
the camera sees all.

15:02.102 --> 15:05.605
But even it is
blinded by a uniform.

15:05.638 --> 15:10.043
The garments that
define these men

15:10.077 --> 15:13.180
obscure their
corporeal physicality.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.383
We, we see hands,
we see a face,

15:16.416 --> 15:21.221
but we forget, friends,
the beating heart.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.257
My series endeavors
to explore the tension

15:24.291 --> 15:27.594
and duality between
intimacy and avoidance,

15:27.627 --> 15:31.131
leaving the observer left
at a crossroads to ponder,

15:31.164 --> 15:34.101
who's really carrying
the baggage?

15:34.134 --> 15:38.105
[crowd applauds]

15:39.439 --> 15:43.043
- Congratulations, you
just sold Carlton.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.648
- Now, excuse me while
I go parlay this news

15:48.681 --> 15:50.650
into a feeding frenzy.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.718
- Worshipping you so hard.

- I don't know what I would
have done without you.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
- Rule number 15 of
Dartmouth bartending:

16:26.353 --> 16:29.456
never let a good girl
go dry.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.292
- Bartending looks good
on you, Lex.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.227
- That's my lot
in life, Joe.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.662
Everything looks
good on me,

16:35.695 --> 16:38.431
just nothing feels right.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.233
- I'm not worried
about you, kid.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.269
They could drop you
anywhere in the universe

16:42.302 --> 16:44.204
and you'll be fine.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.473
- Thank you.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.276
Jennie, mix this man
another Bloody.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.677
On me.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.346
Well actually on
this small business

16:53.380 --> 16:55.515
in which I have no stake.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.218
And thank you
everyone for

16:58.251 --> 17:02.289
reminding me how
incredibly awesome I am.

17:02.322 --> 17:06.359
It's true I've been having
a Lex-istential crisis,

17:06.393 --> 17:08.361
but no more.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.498
I don't need some
exit level position.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.500
I need to go
someplace special.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.170
Someplace where I am
uniquely needed.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.371
From here on out,

17:18.405 --> 17:21.174
I'm aiming for the stars.

17:24.311 --> 17:27.314
- You- you can't leave.
I'm not ready.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.550
- Yes, you are.

17:33.420 --> 17:37.257
- Um, no, she's not!

17:38.225 --> 17:39.526
- Why not a local charity?

17:39.559 --> 17:42.162
I heard someone else is
starting a foundation

17:42.195 --> 17:44.531
to empower golddiggers to
stand up to their oppressors

17:44.564 --> 17:46.466
and divorce their husbands.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.501
It's called
Melania's Tower.

17:48.535 --> 17:52.272
- Well, in the Hamptons, I
actively support efforts

17:52.305 --> 17:55.542
to eradicate female
seasickness on yachts.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.278
Marrying well is so
important,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.247
but you have to feel
well to do it.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.013
- Sorry to interrupt,
Brooke,

18:01.047 --> 18:01.948
but what time
would you like to

18:01.981 --> 18:04.284
make an appearance
at Jill's art show?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.219
- Uh, can you
give us a second?

18:06.253 --> 18:07.320
- Oh my bad.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.521
I was just trying
to do what you

18:08.555 --> 18:10.390
hired me to do.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.294
[gasps]

18:14.327 --> 18:17.297
[sneers]

18:17.330 --> 18:18.365
- So, Brooke.
- Yes.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.299
- Why India?

18:19.332 --> 18:21.201
- Maybe because she
identifies with the

18:21.234 --> 18:22.435
caste system.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.339
- Such a sense of humor
on this one.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.774
That's why I keep
him around,

18:27.807 --> 18:29.609
turning a blind eye to
his bi-weekly

18:29.642 --> 18:32.445

anal hair removal.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.614
- Oh no,
I'm half-Italian!

18:34.647 --> 18:35.782
- The bottom half.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.218
- Oh funny.
Brooke, I thought you

18:38.251 --> 18:40.187
kept me around to
return a phone call,

18:40.220 --> 18:41.588
send an email,
schedule a colonic,

18:41.621 --> 18:44.291
and a $20,000 a month
hair appointment.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.328
- You guys know I'm
still here, right?

18:48.361 --> 18:51.464
And I'm taking notes?

18:51.498 --> 18:54.534
- Devon, consider yourself
relieved of all duties.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.504
Effective immediately...
after you write down

18:57.537 --> 18:59.439
the names of
all my passwords.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.241
And the names of the
housekeepers.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.843
And where I hide my jewels
while they clean.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.579
- Did you just fire me?

19:06.613 --> 19:09.249
- In front of me?

19:09.282 --> 19:14.487
- Yes. I did.
- Wow.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.560
- Derek, I am so sorry

19:20.593 --> 19:22.429
you had to witness that.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.231
If you don't have time to
post the interview

19:24.264 --> 19:25.565
I completely
understand.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.634
- I'm definitely publishing
this story.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.701
For a second
I wasn't sure

19:28.735 --> 19:32.405
if I could get to the essence
of Brooke von Weber

19:32.439 --> 19:35.408
but I think I know exactly
who you are.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.644
Toodles Brooke.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.457
- Check you out
with three red dots!

19:51.924 --> 19:53.660
-Hon, I promise I didn't
buy any of them.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.562
You are a real artist.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.564
- Or am I just a
bullshit artist?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.466
- Madonna would argue
that there is no difference.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.567
- Excellent point.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.335
You are a muse to me.

20:02.369 --> 20:07.474
- Actually, you look exactly
like the guy in that video.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.376
- Oh.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.510
- How do you refresh?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.646
Refresh, refresh, refresh!?

20:13.680 --> 20:17.450
- "Brooke von Weber;
Boss Bitch or just a Bitch?"

20:17.484 --> 20:20.620
- I need a drink.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.490
Oh actually, do you have
Whispering Angel?

20:23.523 --> 20:25.525
- Oh no.
I'm not a waiter but-

20:25.558 --> 20:28.761
- Oh Jill, words cannot
describe the day I've had.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.663
- Actually they can.

20:30.697 --> 20:31.698
"Many women in business

20:31.731 --> 20:33.600
are so concerned with
being liked

20:33.633 --> 20:35.735
that they're afraid to
do what it really takes

20:35.768 --> 20:37.637
to lead the charge."

20:37.670 --> 20:39.606
Are you sure you don't
wanna read this?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.740
- No, I can't-

20:40.773 --> 20:41.608
- "But today I got a peek

20:41.641 --> 20:44.344
behind the pleated
Von Weber valance

20:44.377 --> 20:46.513
and saw firsthand
a woman whose strong

20:46.546 --> 20:50.517
sense of dÃ©cor is bested
only by her decorum."

20:50.550 --> 20:52.519
Whoa, Brooke!

20:52.552 --> 20:55.488
- "BVW is living proof
that it is possible

20:55.522 --> 20:59.992
to act like a role model and
look like a runway model."

21:00.026 --> 21:03.496
Wow. He really
captured my essence.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.498
- Is today National
Masturbation Day?

21:05.532 --> 21:06.333
- Don't hate.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.500
I make my living
off these people.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.570
- You know what?
A toast!

21:10.603 --> 21:13.606
To a triumphant night...

21:13.640 --> 21:15.975
Of my continued success.

21:16.008 --> 21:19.779
By any means necessary.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.648
- Did she just quote
Malcolm X?

21:21.681 --> 21:25.017
- Mm-hmm.

21:25.051 --> 21:25.885
