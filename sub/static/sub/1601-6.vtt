00:00.141 --> 00:02.435
Previously on Bates Motel...

00:02.466 --> 00:04.623
I never seen anyone go
into a hole like that.

00:04.724 --> 00:05.858
Did anyone call my mother?

00:05.959 --> 00:07.760
No, they just called me.

00:07.861 --> 00:09.528
Well, please don't tell her.

00:09.629 --> 00:11.230
That girl is not a good choice.

00:11.331 --> 00:12.765
She's rude. She's disrespectful to adults.

00:12.866 --> 00:14.566
She's a nice girl.

00:14.668 --> 00:17.515
Don't you walk out on me
when I'm talking to you!

00:17.577 --> 00:19.538
Hey, get back here now!

00:19.639 --> 00:20.773
You okay?

00:20.874 --> 00:22.574
I told you to wait in the car.

00:22.676 --> 00:24.543
My dad's a dick. Whatever.

00:31.651 --> 00:34.158
I heard you just saved my brother's life.

00:34.196 --> 00:36.910
- Who are you?
- I'm your boss.

00:47.567 --> 00:49.868
Morning, mother. What's for breakfast?

00:49.969 --> 00:52.638
I didn't make anything. I
actually have to go into town.

00:52.739 --> 00:55.841
I have to do some errands.

00:55.942 --> 00:58.343
Oh, you want me to come?
We can get breakfast out.

00:58.445 --> 01:00.713
No, I have stuff to do.
Stay here and help Emma.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.588
When were you drinking? Was this with Cody?

01:09.689 --> 01:10.789
Don't make a big deal of it.

01:10.890 --> 01:12.524
You know, all kids my age drink.

01:12.625 --> 01:13.859
I didn't raise you to be
all your kids your age.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.028
I raised you to be better.

01:18.499 --> 01:20.299
We're supposed to be taking you to get

01:20.400 --> 01:21.934
your driver's license test this weekend.

01:22.035 --> 01:23.368
How am I supposed to feel okay
about letting you have that,

01:23.470 --> 01:24.536
when you're doing stuff like this?

01:24.637 --> 01:26.238
Mom, I need to be able to drive.

01:26.339 --> 01:27.639
Please, I'm a grown man.

01:27.741 --> 01:31.310
Making immature choices.

01:31.411 --> 01:33.612
It's really important to me.

01:34.647 --> 01:37.583
I know it means a lot to you.

01:39.018 --> 01:42.921
I'm sorry about the beer.

01:43.022 --> 01:46.525
I'm trusting you, Norman.

01:46.626 --> 01:49.027
You cannot keep secrets from me.

01:52.832 --> 01:56.568
I'm gonna get dressed.
Put your clothes away.

02:06.446 --> 02:09.314
Someone's supposed to be
picking me up from work.

02:14.821 --> 02:16.655
You're not Remo.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.192
I hope not.

02:20.293 --> 02:21.894
Come on. Let's go.

02:25.498 --> 02:27.800
Why was I in a hospital two towns over?

02:27.901 --> 02:29.902
Because no one knows
you were in the shootout.

02:30.003 --> 02:33.505
That's why we took you to the
hospital over in ocean view.

02:33.606 --> 02:34.807
It's a better hospital also.

02:34.908 --> 02:36.642
So I wanted to make sure you had the best,

02:36.743 --> 02:38.343
given you jumped in front of a car

02:38.444 --> 02:39.912
to save my dumb-ass brother.

02:42.682 --> 02:43.682
You live up here?

02:45.985 --> 02:50.255
No, I'm taking you up here to kill you.

02:50.356 --> 02:52.758
Yeah, I live up here.

02:55.061 --> 02:58.363
It's a hell of a commute.

02:58.464 --> 03:03.235
Well, let's just say I don't love visitors.

03:12.445 --> 03:14.213
Dozer! Dozer!

03:14.314 --> 03:17.149
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, honey, yeah.

03:17.250 --> 03:20.452
Come on, I'll show you inside.

03:20.553 --> 03:22.221
Don't let the goat bite you in the ass.

03:24.891 --> 03:26.625
Come here.

03:26.726 --> 03:29.595
Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

03:31.531 --> 03:35.300
So, uh, your room's upstairs.

03:35.401 --> 03:39.471
You'll be safe here
until this all blows over.

03:39.572 --> 03:41.273
Are you sure you're not gonna kill me?

03:41.374 --> 03:44.643
Opposite, actually.

03:44.744 --> 03:47.913
I'm very interested in keeping you alive.

03:50.416 --> 03:51.884
Do you have family?

03:51.985 --> 03:53.352
Anyone I need to call,

03:53.453 --> 03:55.754
so they're not worried about you?

03:55.855 --> 03:59.925
No, they don't care about me.

04:00.026 --> 04:02.628
That came out way more pathetic
than it was supposed to.

04:02.729 --> 04:05.898
But, uh, it's fine I'm here.

04:07.901 --> 04:10.903
Here you go.

04:15.975 --> 04:18.709
Yes?

04:18.810 --> 04:21.113
Hi, it's Norma Bates.
I need to see Nick Ford.

04:21.214 --> 04:22.948
Hello, Mrs. Bates.

04:23.049 --> 04:24.783
I don't show that Mr. Ford
has an appointment with you.

04:24.884 --> 04:27.933
Well, he doesn't.

04:28.034 --> 04:30.936
I'm sorry. I don't have him right now.

04:31.037 --> 04:33.805
Well, okay, I'll just drive home,

04:33.906 --> 04:35.573
call him, and then come back.

04:35.675 --> 04:38.843
Okay, Mrs. Bates.

04:40.846 --> 04:43.415
- Norma?
- Oh, hi.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.383
I was just trying to get
in to see you for a moment.

04:45.484 --> 04:46.885
I wanted to talk to you.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.387
I guess you heard the news.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.389
Well, if you mean about Lee Berman,

04:51.490 --> 04:52.857
yes, it's so sad.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.528
Mm, sad... And convenient.

04:56.629 --> 05:01.333
Well, I would never say
someone dying is convenient.

05:01.434 --> 05:04.936
Well, then you'd be lying or ignorant.

05:07.422 --> 05:10.501
There are many times, Norma,
when death is convenient.

05:16.182 --> 05:17.682
I don't want to do this anymore.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.452
You don't want to do what? Stop the bypass?

05:20.553 --> 05:23.121
Well, no. I still want that.

05:23.222 --> 05:26.891
But I-I don't want to do this.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.994
You and me, this.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.964
It's nothing personal.

05:33.065 --> 05:35.600
I just... this is very important to me,

05:35.701 --> 05:38.903
and we barely know each other.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.406
That didn't seem to
bother you the other day.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.943
Before you had the
environmental impact report.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.613
Before Lee Berman drove off a cliff.

05:53.652 --> 05:57.956
Well, I just think it's strange,

05:58.057 --> 06:00.458
Lee Berman dying all of a sudden.

06:00.559 --> 06:01.893
What are you saying,

06:01.994 --> 06:03.561
I had something to do
with Lee Berman's death?

06:03.662 --> 06:05.330
No, I'm not saying that at all.

06:05.431 --> 06:08.600
That would be crazy, right?

06:10.603 --> 06:13.972
I just feel that I can take it from here.

06:19.645 --> 06:22.447
Well, it's... it's been
great getting to meet you,

06:22.548 --> 06:25.750
and I wish you all the best.

06:25.851 --> 06:28.853
You be well, Norma Bates.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.383
Hi.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.451
I had to come over.

07:00.552 --> 07:03.154
Isn't that the weirdest
news about Lee Berman?

07:03.255 --> 07:04.756
- I couldn't believe it.
- I know.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.158
It's terribly sad. He had a wife and kids.

07:07.259 --> 07:11.162
You know, you need to try
and get that open seat.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.399
Does that seem right?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.701
He's dead, the seat's open,

07:16.802 --> 07:18.736
and that bypass is still happening.

07:18.837 --> 07:20.938
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.

07:21.039 --> 07:23.341
There's gonna be a line
of people trying for it.

07:23.442 --> 07:27.044
But a lot of the people around
here in this town are yokels.

07:27.146 --> 07:29.647
And I know Rob is trying
to get a council together

07:29.748 --> 07:32.717
that's a little bit more
sophisticated and educated.

07:32.818 --> 07:34.385
Not... not to sound like a snob.

07:34.486 --> 07:36.754
I seriously don't mean it that way.

07:36.855 --> 07:39.824
But people a little more like... like us.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.361
- Who's Rob?
- The mayor of our city.

07:43.462 --> 07:46.731
Oh, Rob, yeah. Right.

07:46.832 --> 07:48.900
I just... He doesn't even know me.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.701
Well, call him, and tell him

07:50.803 --> 07:52.670
that you want to talk to him
about taking over the seat.

07:52.771 --> 07:54.739
Tell him you're a friend
of mine and Peter's.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.140
They play golf together.

07:56.241 --> 07:58.009
And I'm gonna have George call you

07:58.110 --> 08:00.077
to help prep you for the meeting.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.847
No, I'm not trying to set you up again.

08:02.948 --> 08:04.215
I can take a hint.

08:04.316 --> 08:06.117
I mean, it's not him. He's wonderful.

08:06.218 --> 08:08.619
- I'm just not ready yet.
- Please.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.255
It's just he's fantastic
at this kind of thing.

08:11.356 --> 08:12.857
He was a lawyer for many years.

08:12.958 --> 08:15.393
Politics have always been a hobby of his.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.061
He helped three senators get elected,

08:17.162 --> 08:19.163
and I really think he
could help get this seat.

08:19.264 --> 08:20.631
Really?

08:20.732 --> 08:21.999
I don't want to put you to trouble.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.168
Norma, stop it.

08:24.269 --> 08:26.771
It's no trouble at all.
I am gonna call him.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.139
I think it would be great

08:28.240 --> 08:30.908
to have a smart, single mom

08:31.009 --> 08:32.777
with a business on the board.

08:32.878 --> 08:35.947
Let me know how that call goes, okay?

09:06.311 --> 09:08.646
You slept a long time.

09:08.747 --> 09:10.748
That's good.

09:18.056 --> 09:20.391
What's this?

09:20.492 --> 09:22.393
It's a little elixir I made for you

09:22.494 --> 09:25.930
from some herbs in my garden.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.332
Lavender is the main component.

09:28.433 --> 09:32.870
It has anti-inflammatory
and antiseptic properties.

09:32.971 --> 09:37.208
It also aids in insomnia and anxiety...

09:37.309 --> 09:39.944
Depression.

09:41.446 --> 09:45.516
But that's not our problem.

09:47.986 --> 09:50.454
Go ahead. Drink it.

09:56.361 --> 09:59.397
So I'm gonna make dinner for us.

09:59.498 --> 10:01.299
We'll eat around 7:00.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.135
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.736
Thank you.

10:05.837 --> 10:07.171
I mean, for...

10:07.272 --> 10:09.807
You know, bringing me to your own home.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.693
I'm just dropping off some towels.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.328
Maybe I need more towels.

10:30.429 --> 10:33.264
- I'll bring some later.
- I'll be here.

10:33.365 --> 10:34.932
I thought you had to go sell pot.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.300
I can work around your schedule.

10:36.401 --> 10:39.704
I'll see what I can do.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.339
Do you want to go for a drive later?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.707
Sounds good.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.375
- Okay.
- I'll make it work.

10:44.476 --> 10:47.945
But I've... I've really
got to go deliver towels.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.851
Okay, okay, enjoy your towels.

10:55.921 --> 10:58.389
Oh, I will.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.291
Hey, Emma.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.028
What are you doing?

11:04.129 --> 11:05.396
Oh, nothing.

11:05.497 --> 11:07.732
You know, Cody's just picking me up.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.834
Okay.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.835
Turn that music off, please.

11:44.936 --> 11:46.437
What? I can't hear you.

11:46.538 --> 11:49.206
Thank you.

11:49.307 --> 11:52.109
Norman, give me a moment with Cody, please.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.922
I don't want my son drinking with you.

12:05.023 --> 12:08.059
Who said we were drinking?

12:09.761 --> 12:11.729
There's reasons he shouldn't drink,

12:11.830 --> 12:13.130
medical reasons.

12:13.231 --> 12:15.833
That's all I'm gonna say.

12:15.934 --> 12:19.470
So don't encourage him to
do it, do you understand me?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.773
Yeah.

12:27.145 --> 12:28.813
That's the last time you go with her.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.448
I'm not gonna make a scene today,

12:30.549 --> 12:32.283
but I'll drive you from now on.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.885
Mom, you won't have to,
okay? I'll have my license.

12:34.986 --> 12:36.787
Just promise me you'll use your head,

12:36.888 --> 12:37.788
and you're not gonna let that girl

12:37.889 --> 12:39.056
make you do anything stupid.

12:39.157 --> 12:40.825
Mother, I promise.

13:00.045 --> 13:02.446
You okay?

13:02.547 --> 13:05.349
Yeah.

13:05.450 --> 13:08.085
Let's blow off tech.

13:08.186 --> 13:12.222
I don't want to go build crap today.

13:12.324 --> 13:15.426
Let's go to the swimming hole at the river.

13:15.527 --> 13:17.061
Don't we need to show up and do our job?

13:20.498 --> 13:22.633
You're awesome.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.201
I'm gonna swing by my place

13:24.302 --> 13:28.739
and steal some liquor before we head out.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.245
- You like rum?
- Hmm.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.281
I don't really, but neither does he,

13:37.382 --> 13:38.983
so he won't notice if it's missing.

13:42.487 --> 13:43.921
It's my dad. Something happened.

13:44.022 --> 13:45.255
Come on.

14:00.572 --> 14:03.107
Shh.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.075
We're just playing, okay?

14:05.176 --> 14:06.910
We're not going to tell daddy where we are.

14:09.714 --> 14:12.716
I know he sounds angry, but
it's just a game, just a game.

14:15.153 --> 14:16.520
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

14:24.462 --> 14:27.631
Norman.

14:27.732 --> 14:30.534
Norman.

14:33.338 --> 14:36.006
It's okay. Norman, he's gone.

14:43.148 --> 14:46.617
How often is this happening?

14:46.718 --> 14:49.086
I guess more lately.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.656
I don't know why.

14:52.757 --> 14:56.460
What... what happened to your dad?

14:56.561 --> 14:58.495
Uh, I think he just forgot his meds.

14:58.596 --> 15:01.532
His back's screwed up. He left.

15:03.501 --> 15:04.568
You sure you're okay?

15:04.669 --> 15:07.304
Yeah, I'm fine.

15:09.974 --> 15:12.309
We can go now.

15:23.512 --> 15:25.680
Don't you think it's gonna rain?

15:25.781 --> 15:28.583
I don't know. Doesn't really matter.

15:28.684 --> 15:30.051
It's kind of cool to
be outside in the rain.

15:30.152 --> 15:32.420
It's a little cold.

15:32.521 --> 15:35.119
That's what liquor is for.

15:42.931 --> 15:45.466
I'm sorry about your dad.

15:45.567 --> 15:48.403
What do you mean?

15:48.504 --> 15:50.438
That you're scared of him.

15:58.614 --> 16:02.383
He's not always like that.

16:02.484 --> 16:05.586
Sometimes he's nice.

16:05.687 --> 16:08.289
He's funny when we watch TV together.

16:08.390 --> 16:11.826
He makes a lot of jokes.

16:13.829 --> 16:16.831
I just wish he could be happy.

16:20.002 --> 16:22.770
I'm sorry.

16:27.476 --> 16:28.743
Hey, you know what's fun?

16:28.844 --> 16:30.845
What?

16:39.188 --> 16:41.923
I'm not sure this is a
good day for a picnic.

16:42.024 --> 16:43.424
It'll be fine.

16:43.525 --> 16:45.426
We have each other to keep ourselves warm.

16:45.527 --> 16:47.762
Wish it was warm. I kind
of wanted to go swimming.

16:47.863 --> 16:49.497
How do you do that?

16:49.598 --> 16:51.499
You know, with the... With the O2?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.401
Oh, I just take it out.

16:53.502 --> 16:56.270
I mean, I can't do anything uber-athletic,

16:56.371 --> 16:58.039
but it's workable.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.874
Okay, cool.

16:59.975 --> 17:03.044
Kind of looks like some
other people got here first.

17:03.145 --> 17:06.614
Well, it is a pretty rad spot.

17:08.083 --> 17:09.550
Maybe we should leave.

17:09.651 --> 17:11.551
Ha, it's Norman. Hey, Norman Bates!

17:12.921 --> 17:16.357
Oh, damn. It's Emma.

17:16.458 --> 17:19.060
Hey, Emma. Gunner.

17:19.161 --> 17:20.560
Looks like we all had the same idea.

17:20.662 --> 17:22.663
We can find another spot.

17:22.763 --> 17:24.598
That's stupid.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.367
We can all hang out here.

17:27.469 --> 17:29.704
I saw you at the beach
party. You sell pot, right?

17:29.805 --> 17:32.006
- Maybe.
- Cool.

17:32.107 --> 17:36.077
How cold do you think the water is today?

17:36.178 --> 17:38.045
Want to find out?

17:44.153 --> 17:47.655
Hey, Sheriff Romero, I
wanted to ask you something.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.924
Yeah.

17:50.025 --> 17:51.392
Can I call you by your name?

17:51.493 --> 17:52.393
It's a little stupid at this point.

17:52.494 --> 17:54.462
"Hey, Sheriff Romero."

17:54.563 --> 17:59.367
I've never seen you in a suit.

17:59.468 --> 18:02.570
Yeah, I'm on my way to testify
in the Kyle Miller hearing,

18:02.671 --> 18:05.740
so... that's what you wanted to ask me?

18:05.841 --> 18:07.341
Yeah, you can call me Alex.

18:07.442 --> 18:09.477
No, actually, I'm gonna
talk to Mayor Woodriff

18:09.578 --> 18:11.846
about giving me Lee Berman's seat.

18:12.447 --> 18:15.249
I was wondering if you had
some tips on issues to cover.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.450
You're not gonna get that seat.

18:16.551 --> 18:18.318
What is it with you about me...

18:18.420 --> 18:20.454
Just, I know what you're
up against, how things work.

18:20.555 --> 18:22.289
It's very political, in the worst sense.

18:22.390 --> 18:25.292
Well, my friend Christine
Heldens got me a meeting.

18:25.393 --> 18:26.427
I don't think that could've happened

18:26.528 --> 18:28.028
if there was no chance.

18:28.129 --> 18:31.165
Well, good luck. I hope it goes well, I do.

18:38.973 --> 18:41.475
Uh, listen.

18:41.576 --> 18:43.177
It's a little awkward,

18:43.278 --> 18:45.512
but I think you should be made aware of it.

18:45.613 --> 18:47.114
What?

18:47.215 --> 18:49.083
Well, sometimes at night,

18:49.184 --> 18:50.784
when you have your light on in the bedroom,

18:50.885 --> 18:52.953
you can see right through those curtains.

18:53.054 --> 18:55.489
You can?

18:55.590 --> 18:57.424
Yeah.

19:02.130 --> 19:04.431
All right.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.408
Whoo-hoo!

19:17.078 --> 19:19.847
Whoo! Not even cold!

19:19.948 --> 19:21.515
You're a total liar.

19:21.616 --> 19:23.951
Whoo!

19:24.052 --> 19:26.220
All right, who's next?

19:26.321 --> 19:28.455
- Norman?
- I don't know.

19:28.556 --> 19:30.424
Gunner looks kind of blue.

19:30.525 --> 19:32.226
That's 'cause it's cold.

19:32.327 --> 19:35.462
That's not a reason to not go and do it.

19:35.563 --> 19:37.030
Come on. I'm gonna do it.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.999
Yeah. Yeah, you just...

19:39.100 --> 19:40.467
You just run and jump, huh?

19:40.568 --> 19:43.303
Yeah, and don't forget to let go.

19:43.404 --> 19:46.240
It's not brain surgery.

19:47.542 --> 19:50.477
It looks kind of exciting.

20:00.421 --> 20:01.321
Hoo!

20:01.422 --> 20:03.257
Aah!

20:03.358 --> 20:05.993
Aah!

20:09.164 --> 20:10.330
Oh!

20:12.100 --> 20:14.168
Mother!

20:15.370 --> 20:19.206
Oh. Right to the bone.

20:19.307 --> 20:21.542
- You're not cold?
- You kidding me?

20:21.643 --> 20:23.410
Gonna have a frickin' heart attack.

20:23.511 --> 20:25.913
Ah, I wish I could do it.

20:26.014 --> 20:28.081
Can't you just take that
stuff out for a second?

20:28.183 --> 20:30.184
Yeah, well, I do sometimes.

20:30.285 --> 20:31.819
I don't think that's a good idea.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.453
God, Norman, stop
worrying about everything.

20:33.555 --> 20:34.922
She can totally do this.

20:35.023 --> 20:37.391
I want to try.

20:37.492 --> 20:39.860
You sure? It's really cold.

20:39.961 --> 20:41.595
Yeah, I'm completely sure.

20:41.696 --> 20:44.064
Guys, stop treating her
like she's made of glass.

20:44.165 --> 20:45.132
Emma!

20:45.233 --> 20:48.535
It will be fine. Okay.

20:48.636 --> 20:50.571
Here I go!

21:02.383 --> 21:05.052
Emma?

21:08.223 --> 21:09.122
Emma!

21:09.224 --> 21:10.858
Get her tank.

21:10.959 --> 21:13.293
Emma!

21:13.394 --> 21:14.995
It's okay.

21:16.297 --> 21:18.565
Get her tank and some blankets!

21:23.371 --> 21:28.175
Come on!

21:28.276 --> 21:31.578
Let's go.

21:31.679 --> 21:34.915
Now, breathe, okay? In and out.

21:35.016 --> 21:38.418
All right, nice and easy.
Don't think about anything else.

21:48.496 --> 21:50.030
What the hell do you think you were doing

21:50.131 --> 21:52.032
- telling her to do that?
- I didn't know.

21:52.133 --> 21:53.834
She could've died, and it
would've been your fault!

21:53.935 --> 21:57.504
Everyone isn't just some
toy for you to play with!

21:57.605 --> 21:58.906
Listen, man, she didn't know.

21:59.007 --> 22:02.009
Shut up and stay out of this!

22:13.521 --> 22:15.656
I'm sorry.

22:20.094 --> 22:22.195
I'm so sorry.

22:22.297 --> 22:25.632
It's okay. I'm here.

22:32.704 --> 22:34.411
Hey.

22:34.512 --> 22:35.813
You ready to learn everything

22:35.914 --> 22:37.818
you never wanted to know
about local politics?

22:37.916 --> 22:39.150
Thank God, I actually got an appointment

22:39.251 --> 22:40.518
with the mayor tomorrow.

22:40.619 --> 22:44.855
I'm panicking. Come on in.

22:44.957 --> 22:48.226
So nice of you to come
and help me with this.

22:48.327 --> 22:51.495
Christine said that
you used to be a lawyer?

22:51.563 --> 22:53.497
Yeah, for a while. Corporate law.

22:53.599 --> 22:55.466
Why'd you stop?

22:55.567 --> 22:58.469
Uh, well...

22:58.570 --> 23:00.571
Okay, there's this old John Ford movie

23:00.639 --> 23:02.073
called The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,

23:02.174 --> 23:03.841
and it's about this
young, idealistic lawyer

23:03.909 --> 23:05.977
who goes to this wild
west town to civilize it.

23:06.078 --> 23:07.745
Yeah, I know that movie. I love it.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.847
So do I.

23:14.119 --> 23:16.854
Anyway, I always identified

23:16.922 --> 23:18.022
with that guy for some reason, the lawyer.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.523
He was brave,

23:19.625 --> 23:20.691
and he cared about people and justice,

23:20.759 --> 23:22.660
so I went to law school.

23:22.761 --> 23:24.128
And then?

23:24.196 --> 23:25.663
And then my ex-wife found out

23:25.764 --> 23:27.164
how much public defenders make a year,

23:27.266 --> 23:28.799
and suddenly, I was at a white-shoe firm

23:28.900 --> 23:30.868
doing mergers and acquisitions.

23:30.936 --> 23:32.837
Trust me, you can only do that for so long

23:32.938 --> 23:34.839
before you start sounding
like Scrooge Mcduck.

23:38.677 --> 23:39.710
Okay, should I just dive in?

23:39.811 --> 23:42.913
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

23:44.216 --> 23:45.716
My parents look like they should be

23:45.817 --> 23:48.919
on the cover of an
album from the late '60s.

23:49.021 --> 23:52.056
My dad started growing weed
for him and some of his buddies,

23:52.124 --> 23:54.458
and turns out he kind
of had a knack for it.

23:54.559 --> 23:58.062
It was awesome weed,
and everybody wanted it.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.931
He was kind of a botanical artist.

24:01.033 --> 24:04.669
And pretty soon, he had
this big business going.

24:04.770 --> 24:07.772
Then, my parents both died
and left me the business,

24:07.873 --> 24:10.875
whether I wanted it or not.

24:21.887 --> 24:25.523
This is incredible.

24:25.624 --> 24:28.693
Come on. Check it out.

24:31.063 --> 24:32.897
How many strains you got going here?

24:32.998 --> 24:34.498
At one time?

24:34.599 --> 24:38.035
I don't know. Maybe 20, 30 varieties.

24:38.136 --> 24:39.870
I blend them.

24:39.971 --> 24:42.173
I crossbreed them.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.809
It's the part I love.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.712
Yeah, I can tell.

24:51.717 --> 24:53.684
I need you to do something for me.

24:53.785 --> 24:55.953
Oh, yeah? What's that?

24:56.054 --> 24:58.656
I never should've given
my brother Gil's position.

24:58.724 --> 25:02.493
He can't handle it.

25:02.594 --> 25:04.028
Relax, this isn't a test.

25:04.096 --> 25:08.799
I'm not gonna cut off your
head if you betray Zane.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.802
That's good to know.

25:11.903 --> 25:14.238
But here's what I need you to do for me.

25:14.339 --> 25:17.241
I need you to watch him.

25:17.342 --> 25:18.843
Make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.

25:18.910 --> 25:21.812
Basically, I want you to run things

25:21.913 --> 25:24.915
without letting him know
that you're running things.

25:28.186 --> 25:29.987
It's not gonna be hard.

25:30.088 --> 25:33.824
Speaking of running things,

25:33.925 --> 25:36.193
if you're in charge,
how come I never see you?

25:36.294 --> 25:38.162
I don't like getting my hands dirty.

25:38.263 --> 25:41.465
That's kind of funny.

25:41.566 --> 25:44.702
I mean, you really seem to like dirt.

25:44.803 --> 25:49.173
I do like dirt.

25:49.274 --> 25:50.908
It's honest.

25:54.546 --> 25:56.147
And so my question would be two-pronged.

25:56.214 --> 25:59.517
What are the city's goals with
regards to historic properties,

25:59.584 --> 26:01.185
and what are the city's responsibilities?

26:01.286 --> 26:03.988
- Norma.
- What? What'd I do wrong?

26:04.089 --> 26:06.157
Nothing. But it's... it's not...

26:06.224 --> 26:07.625
It's not about that.

26:07.726 --> 26:08.926
You're fine,

26:09.027 --> 26:11.529
and you've clearly done the research.

26:11.596 --> 26:14.465
But that's not what's
gonna get you this seat.

26:14.566 --> 26:17.134
Well, so what is?

26:17.235 --> 26:18.936
Look.

26:19.037 --> 26:20.871
You don't have to impress anyone

26:20.972 --> 26:23.140
that you're competent or
informed or intelligent.

26:23.241 --> 26:25.976
That's all very obvious.

26:26.044 --> 26:27.978
But there's a... There's a depth

26:28.046 --> 26:31.482
and a presence and a force about you

26:31.550 --> 26:32.550
that's so engaging.

26:32.651 --> 26:36.187
You've got to let that show.

26:36.254 --> 26:38.889
Norma Bates is a lovely,
poised, competent woman,

26:38.957 --> 26:40.491
who just happens to know

26:40.592 --> 26:41.959
about municipal code
violations and overlay zones.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.494
That's it.

26:43.595 --> 26:45.529
Don't... don't be so worried

26:45.597 --> 26:47.665
about bringing all this
information to the meeting,

26:47.766 --> 26:49.467
that you leave yourself at home,

26:49.534 --> 26:51.969
'cause you're the best part.

26:53.705 --> 26:56.974
Thank you.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.544
You're welcome.

27:15.861 --> 27:18.796
Are you awake?

27:18.897 --> 27:20.898
I am now.

27:23.635 --> 27:26.837
Don't take this personally.

27:26.905 --> 27:29.173
I won't.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.161
Hello?

28:02.877 --> 28:04.478
- Hey, Emma.
- Oh.

28:04.546 --> 28:06.714
You... You feeling better today?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.983
Fine. I-I shouldn't have done that.

28:10.085 --> 28:12.653
I don't know what I was trying to prove.

28:12.754 --> 28:15.489
Oh, yeah, I don't know what
any of us were trying to prove.

28:15.557 --> 28:18.358
I just wanted to say thank you for...

28:18.460 --> 28:21.428
Possibly saving my life.

28:21.529 --> 28:24.531
Oh, no, I don't think I did.

28:26.534 --> 28:28.502
I, um,

28:28.570 --> 28:29.903
I lost it a bit.

28:30.004 --> 28:33.907
You know, I hope I didn't embarrass you.

28:34.008 --> 28:36.376
No, it was what it was.
It was a little scary,

28:36.478 --> 28:38.445
and... and you just reacted.

28:38.546 --> 28:40.481
Yeah.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.350
Did I overreact?

28:43.451 --> 28:46.487
Overreact?

28:46.588 --> 28:49.723
You know, like, the
world's coming to an end.

28:49.824 --> 28:52.359
You seemed upset.

28:52.460 --> 28:54.695
You know, in a way that
a person would be upset

28:54.763 --> 28:57.898
if someone they cared about might be hurt.

28:57.966 --> 28:59.533
You're... You're just sensitive,

28:59.601 --> 29:01.368
and to be honest, it
was nice to have someone

29:01.469 --> 29:04.505
be that upset on my behalf.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.809
Yeah, so it all just seemed normal.

29:08.877 --> 29:10.978
You're asking the wrong person.

29:11.045 --> 29:13.680
I don't really know what "normal" means.

29:13.782 --> 29:16.884
But I don't want you to
worry about it, please.

29:19.420 --> 29:21.488
You okay?

29:21.589 --> 29:25.025
Oh, yeah. No, I'm... I'm fine.

29:25.126 --> 29:26.026
I was just wondering how you were.

29:26.127 --> 29:27.561
I'm glad you're better.

29:27.662 --> 29:30.564
I am gonna get working on my crow.

29:30.665 --> 29:33.066
Well, yeah, sure. I'll
let you get back to work.

29:33.168 --> 29:35.803
I, um, just...

29:35.904 --> 29:40.174
Just wanted to say thank you, Norman.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.410
Yeah. You're welcome.

29:43.511 --> 29:45.512
Yeah.

29:51.452 --> 29:55.923
We'd like to preserve
the integrity of... wow.

29:55.990 --> 29:57.724
We'd like to preserve the coastal integrity

29:57.826 --> 29:59.393
of White Pine Bay.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.396
We... we have to regulate
the construction density.

30:02.463 --> 30:04.464
What? The construction d...

30:04.532 --> 30:06.800
What time are you... what
time are you meeting the mayor?

30:06.901 --> 30:10.604
2:00. Can I tell you my points again?

30:10.705 --> 30:12.506
Mom, I've heard them many times.

30:12.607 --> 30:14.141
- You know them.
- I know.

30:14.242 --> 30:17.578
I know, and George told me not
to focus on the information.

30:17.645 --> 30:19.413
- George did?
- Yeah.

30:19.514 --> 30:20.514
He came by and helped me yesterday.

30:20.615 --> 30:22.616
He's so nice.

30:22.717 --> 30:26.086
What exactly did he tell you to focus on?

30:26.187 --> 30:28.188
He told me that I shouldn't be so focused

30:28.289 --> 30:30.657
on reciting facts that
I forget to bring myself,

30:30.758 --> 30:33.760
that I'm the best part.

30:36.197 --> 30:37.464
Yeah, George is right.

30:37.565 --> 30:40.000
You should listen to George.

30:40.101 --> 30:42.469
I got to go to the hardware store

30:42.570 --> 30:46.039
and get glue for the glue gun.

30:46.107 --> 30:47.708
Oh, and don't forget my
driver's test in the morning.

30:47.809 --> 30:49.476
I'm not gonna forget.

30:49.577 --> 30:52.379
When's the last time I
forgot an appointment for you?

30:52.480 --> 30:54.581
- Norman?
- What?

30:54.682 --> 30:56.450
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

30:56.551 --> 30:58.619
Getting this seat means everything to us.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.588
Good luck, mother.

31:01.689 --> 31:04.758
They'd be lucky to get you
on their stupid council.

31:15.236 --> 31:18.005
The mayor is ready for you, Mrs. Bates.

31:30.051 --> 31:32.920
I understand that coastal
development is necessary,

31:33.021 --> 31:36.023
but it really needs to
be seriously controlled,

31:36.124 --> 31:39.459
in order to maintain a
kind of quality of life

31:39.527 --> 31:40.961
that I think we're all used to living here

31:41.062 --> 31:44.598
in Pine White Bay... Or White Pine Bay.

31:46.701 --> 31:49.569
So how do you know the Heldens?

31:49.671 --> 31:52.706
Oh, Christine and I met
at community theater.

31:52.807 --> 31:55.375
Ah. I love them both.

31:55.443 --> 31:57.744
They're really great friends of mine,

31:57.812 --> 31:59.579
and they love you.

31:59.681 --> 32:02.649
That's nice to hear. Yeah.

32:02.717 --> 32:05.419
They're great.

32:05.520 --> 32:09.056
And you also know Nick Ford.

32:09.157 --> 32:12.626
Yes, I do.

32:14.896 --> 32:18.131
He also has really great
things to say about you,

32:18.232 --> 32:22.803
and he really wants you to have this seat.

32:24.172 --> 32:27.507
I appreciate his support.

32:27.608 --> 32:30.911
Well, his support means something.

32:31.012 --> 32:34.982
You really don't want to cross Nick Ford.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.385
No, I don't suppose you do.

32:40.555 --> 32:42.956
Okay, uh, great.

32:43.024 --> 32:44.858
Thank you for stopping by.

32:44.926 --> 32:47.127
Oh, you don't want me to
talk about my positions on...

32:47.195 --> 32:49.429
Well, no, judging by the company you keep,

32:49.530 --> 32:51.932
I know all that I need to know.

32:54.936 --> 32:57.571
So it was nice to meet you, Norma.

32:57.672 --> 33:00.073
- Nice to put a face to the name.
- Yeah.

33:00.174 --> 33:02.409
You've made a really big impression

33:02.477 --> 33:04.378
around here in a short time.

33:04.479 --> 33:05.846
Well, that wasn't my intent.

33:05.947 --> 33:08.515
I just wanted to move to a
nice, quiet town with my son.

33:08.583 --> 33:10.417
Well, it's worked out for you.

33:10.485 --> 33:14.921
You are in with all the right people.

33:15.023 --> 33:16.390
- Okay, sure thing.
- So, uh...

33:16.491 --> 33:18.658
Thanks again for stopping by.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.127
I'll be making my decision very quickly.

33:20.228 --> 33:21.995
Okay, very good. Thank you so much.

33:22.096 --> 33:24.531
- You're welcome.
- Yep.

33:38.212 --> 33:40.213
- Hey.
- Hi.

33:43.217 --> 33:46.720
Sorry about the other day.

33:46.788 --> 33:49.022
I'm like, "jump off a
rope and drown yourself."

33:49.123 --> 33:50.824
Miss peer pressure here.

33:50.925 --> 33:54.061
It's not your fault. I
totally wanted to do it.

33:54.162 --> 33:57.898
Just got out of control.

33:57.965 --> 34:00.000
Oh, Norman's not here right now.

34:00.068 --> 34:01.701
I actually came to see you.

34:05.751 --> 34:08.953
You know how Norman got
all crazy out of control?

34:09.021 --> 34:11.289
Yeah.

34:13.525 --> 34:15.126
Is he all right?

34:15.194 --> 34:18.663
Well, he's sensitive and emotional.

34:21.033 --> 34:23.868
Why? What happened?

34:23.936 --> 34:25.103
What?

34:25.204 --> 34:27.672
Please, tell me.

34:27.773 --> 34:30.041
He's blacked out twice in front of me,

34:30.141 --> 34:31.609
and he told me it's happened before.

34:31.677 --> 34:33.411
Blacked out? You mean fainted?

34:33.478 --> 34:36.481
- He fainted once at school.
- No, he, like, leaves his body.

34:36.581 --> 34:38.916
He can physically move
and even talk a little,

34:39.016 --> 34:41.552
but he's not in there.

34:41.652 --> 34:43.721
And then he wakes up later.

34:43.822 --> 34:47.658
It's like he's sleepwalking.

34:47.759 --> 34:49.927
I had no idea.

34:50.027 --> 34:51.795
Well, he told me not to tell his mom,

34:51.864 --> 34:54.498
but now I'm worried I
should be telling someone,

34:54.600 --> 34:56.000
'cause maybe there's
something really wrong with him

34:56.101 --> 35:00.138
and he needs help.

35:00.239 --> 35:02.840
He likes you a lot and trusts you.

35:02.941 --> 35:05.943
I can see that.

35:06.044 --> 35:08.613
So this is me, just kind of
giving you this information,

35:08.714 --> 35:10.448
so you can do what you think is right.

35:10.516 --> 35:12.617
There, I'm done.

35:14.620 --> 35:18.055
Why didn't he want you to tell Norma?

35:18.157 --> 35:20.858
He just said, "she'll get upset."

35:40.081 --> 35:40.981
Hello.

35:41.082 --> 35:42.249
- Norma Bates?
- Yes.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.650
Congratulations.

35:43.751 --> 35:44.885
You're the newest member
of the city council.

35:44.986 --> 35:46.453
Really?

35:46.554 --> 35:48.989
I have a few items for you
to pick up today as well.

35:49.090 --> 35:50.924
Oh, yeah, I can be there for that.

35:51.025 --> 35:52.292
Your parking permit, keys, and...

35:52.393 --> 35:54.127
Wait, you're sure about this, right?

35:54.228 --> 35:56.430
The mayor is quite set on his decision.

35:56.531 --> 36:01.501
Okay. Thank you very much for calling.

36:07.275 --> 36:10.210
- Norman, guess what.
- What?

36:10.311 --> 36:13.046
I got a seat. I'm on the council!

36:13.147 --> 36:14.414
- Aw, yes!
- Yeah!

36:14.515 --> 36:17.651
That's wonderful, mom.

36:17.752 --> 36:20.387
You ready to go?

36:20.488 --> 36:22.356
You got your DMV test in an hour.

36:22.457 --> 36:23.890
Yeah, I'm ready.

36:23.992 --> 36:27.094
Aw, I'm so proud of you, mother. Aw.

36:27.195 --> 36:28.495
Yeah, you know, I didn't
think I could do it,

36:28.596 --> 36:30.597
but I guess you just got
to believe in yourself,

36:30.698 --> 36:32.399
- you know?
- Hmm.

36:32.500 --> 36:35.102
And now, you're getting your license.

36:35.203 --> 36:37.104
What a great day.

36:37.205 --> 36:40.640
I told you moving here would
be the best thing we ever did.

36:47.415 --> 36:49.516
Don't forget your seat belt.

36:51.452 --> 36:52.452
- Bates?
- Uh-huh.

36:52.553 --> 36:54.187
Hello, there. Hi.

37:03.664 --> 37:05.132
Hi, Emma.

37:05.233 --> 37:09.102
Hi. Are you coming back soon?

37:10.405 --> 37:12.639
Uh, it's gonna be a few hours. Why?

37:12.740 --> 37:14.641
I just have to tell you something.

37:14.742 --> 37:16.676
What's wrong?

37:16.778 --> 37:18.979
I'd rather tell you in person.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.381
Well, now you got me all
worried, so just tell me.

37:21.482 --> 37:22.949
Really, I'd rather...

37:23.051 --> 37:25.385
Emma, what's wrong?

37:28.990 --> 37:31.725
Did you know Norman is having blackouts?

37:36.064 --> 37:39.933
What are... What are you talking about?

37:40.034 --> 37:42.936
That girl, Cody Brennen, told me.

37:43.037 --> 37:44.604
Told you what? How does she know anything?

37:44.705 --> 37:46.540
She said that Norman has blacked out twice

37:46.641 --> 37:49.509
when he's been with her,
like he's sleepwalking.

37:49.610 --> 37:52.079
And he told her it had happened before.

37:52.180 --> 37:55.415
I guess he told her not to
tell you, but she was worried.

37:55.516 --> 37:56.950
She didn't know if she
should tell you anyways,

37:57.051 --> 37:59.186
so she told me.

37:59.287 --> 38:01.555
And I'm telling you.

38:01.656 --> 38:04.691
I'm sorry.

38:09.664 --> 38:13.533
Thanks, Emma. It's okay. Bye.

38:22.944 --> 38:24.377
Can someone get their license

38:24.479 --> 38:28.014
if they've been experiencing blackouts?

38:28.116 --> 38:30.917
- Mother, what are you talking...
- Norman.

38:31.018 --> 38:32.152
Has he experienced a loss of consciousness

38:32.253 --> 38:33.887
in the last three years?

38:33.988 --> 38:36.389
Yes, he has.

38:40.728 --> 38:42.195
I'm sorry,

38:42.296 --> 38:44.264
but he absolutely can't get a license.

38:44.365 --> 38:48.135
He can apply in three years,
if he has no recurrences.

39:09.724 --> 39:13.059
You have to talk to me eventually.

39:14.495 --> 39:15.962
How could you do that to me?

39:16.063 --> 39:18.365
How could I not? It's not safe.

39:18.466 --> 39:20.167
Why, all of a sudden, do you even think

39:20.268 --> 39:21.401
I'm having blackouts?

39:21.502 --> 39:24.137
Norman, I just know.

39:24.238 --> 39:25.372
Well, I want to know how you know,

39:25.473 --> 39:27.240
because I don't believe you know.

39:27.341 --> 39:28.575
I just think you're think
you're making all this up

39:28.676 --> 39:30.310
because you don't want me to drive.

39:30.411 --> 39:33.213
Cody Brennen told Emma.
She was worried about you.

39:33.314 --> 39:34.381
Cody, huh?

39:34.482 --> 39:38.351
Yeah, I warned you about her.

39:38.452 --> 39:40.187
- Pull over.
- No, I'm not gonna pull over.

39:40.288 --> 39:44.024
I said pull over!

39:48.629 --> 39:51.064
- Where are you going?
- Leave me alone, mother.

39:51.165 --> 39:53.533
I don't want to. I'm worried.

39:53.634 --> 39:56.536
Where are you going?

39:56.637 --> 39:59.072
Go home, mother.

40:00.775 --> 40:02.375
I'm not a little boy.

40:02.476 --> 40:03.510
You can't keep me locked up in our house

40:03.611 --> 40:05.579
for the rest of my life.

40:05.680 --> 40:08.582
Since I can't drive, I'm walking.

40:08.683 --> 40:09.683
Now, go home.

40:15.790 --> 40:19.025
Okay, Norman. Okay.

40:47.421 --> 40:50.156
- Norman, what?
- Why did you tell Emma?

40:50.258 --> 40:51.291
I was worried about you.
I didn't know what to do.

40:51.392 --> 40:52.592
How could you do that to me?

40:52.693 --> 40:54.227
- I trusted you!
- Shh. My dad's asleep.

40:54.328 --> 40:55.662
He's been working all
night. You need to go.

40:55.763 --> 40:57.564
I don't care.

40:57.665 --> 40:59.099
I'm sorry, Norman, it seemed
like the right thing to do.

40:59.200 --> 41:00.300
How could it be the right thing to do

41:00.401 --> 41:01.601
when I specifically said

41:01.702 --> 41:03.169
I didn't want to worry my mother?

41:03.271 --> 41:04.938
I didn't tell your mom. I told Emma.

41:05.039 --> 41:06.106
Well, that's as good as telling my mom.

41:06.207 --> 41:09.009
I got to go work all night.

41:09.110 --> 41:11.144
What the hell's going on out here, hmm?

41:11.245 --> 41:13.213
Nothing, dad.

41:13.314 --> 41:17.183
What's this guy doing here?

41:17.285 --> 41:19.219
I don't need this right now, Cody.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.087
I came here to talk to your daughter.

41:21.188 --> 41:24.224
What?

41:24.325 --> 41:25.892
Just go back to bed, dad.

41:25.993 --> 41:27.560
He goes, all right? Then I deal with you.

41:27.662 --> 41:30.997
Let go of her!

41:31.098 --> 41:33.266
Bringing your trashy, little
hookups back to my house?

41:33.367 --> 41:34.401
It's not a hookup!

41:34.502 --> 41:36.303
Leave her alone!

41:36.404 --> 41:37.637
Dad!

41:44.267 --> 41:50.267
