Sometimes I can't help
but feel like

39:18.960 --> 39:21.750
I don't belong
on this team.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.620
I'm not like
the rest of you.

39:36.250 --> 39:40.000
Since we're...
giving advice,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.830
do you mind
if I offer you some?

39:42.830 --> 39:47.620
You pick up on details
that no one else does.

39:47.620 --> 39:50.080
Except for the ones
right in front of you.

39:52.250 --> 39:53.580
Owen.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.790
He's into you.

39:57.580 --> 39:58.670
Yeah, girl.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.120
What's up?
What's going on?

40:06.120 --> 40:08.210
Look...

40:08.210 --> 40:10.170
There's something
I need to tell you.

40:10.170 --> 40:11.250
You're pregnant?

40:11.250 --> 40:13.830
Shelby, just...

40:13.830 --> 40:15.710
Listen.

40:15.710 --> 40:17.670
I don't want to look back
and realize this is the moment

40:17.670 --> 40:19.250
where I screwed
everything up.

40:20.790 --> 40:22.040
Okay.

40:23.670 --> 40:26.120
You remember a few weeks ago
when Alex was in the hospital

40:26.120 --> 40:28.670
and...you know, we all thought
she was gonna die?

40:31.380 --> 40:33.670
Always the one closest to you
holding the knife.

40:38.960 --> 40:40.750
Just say it.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.000
I kissed her.

40:46.710 --> 40:50.250
So, Dmitri didn't kill you,
and you didn't kill him.

40:52.170 --> 40:53.250
No.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.620
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.

40:57.620 --> 40:59.670
You have nothing
to apologize for.

40:59.670 --> 41:02.620
I should never
have trusted him.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.710
It wasn't your fault,
Harry.

We didn't get to save the king,

Yeah.

Well, he seems
