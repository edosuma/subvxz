00:29.463 --> 00:33.033
I'm Scott Fitzgerald.
May I?

00:33.101 --> 00:34.935
Woman:
Well, that depends.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.404
On what?

00:39.473 --> 00:42.376
On what you got
in that flask of yours.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
Whiskey.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.679
I'll get you some ginger ale.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.248
I take it straight.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.730
How do you feel about free love?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.598
Free love?

01:04.665 --> 01:07.668
Like Blake or Shelly's
concept of?

01:07.735 --> 01:09.137
And Isadora Duncan.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.639
- The dancer.
- She was an atheist.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.541
She had two children
out of wedlock.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.044
They both died.
It was quite tragic.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.746
- I didn't know.
- Hmm.

01:20.814 --> 01:21.915
May I?

01:21.982 --> 01:23.817
No, you may not, old bean.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.789
So what about this
Isadora Duncan?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.791
Have you ever seen her dance?

01:30.858 --> 01:33.327
No. But I like her style.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.763
She's dark and wild as sin.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.399
Huh. And you?

01:38.466 --> 01:41.402
I'm the only girl
in town with style.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.770
I guarantee you that.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.441
Lord, it's so blazing hot.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.976
I don't know how y'all can stand

01:49.042 --> 01:50.077
to wear all that wool

01:50.178 --> 01:51.412
and not want to strip down

01:51.479 --> 01:53.080
and jump in his own creek.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.748
Well, if you promise to join me.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.684
Oh, you think I wouldn't?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.586
Okay, then. Let's go.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.089
You mean tonight?
It's almost midnight.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.891
- So?
- Zelda,

02:03.957 --> 02:06.093
Daddy's r'aring to go.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.761
I got to scoot.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.198
You can telephone me some time.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.266
Oh, can I?

02:12.333 --> 02:13.610
Judge Anthony Sayre's residence.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.769
Don't take any guff
from the operator.

02:15.836 --> 02:16.904
They don't look kindly

02:16.970 --> 02:18.906
on soldiers phoning local girls.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.212
I'm going to be a famous
writer some day.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.113
You should know that.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.316
We'll see.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.085
Who's that, Zelda?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.687
Just some boy.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.967
[ring]

02:47.034 --> 02:48.636
Sayre residence.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.438
[ring]

02:50.504 --> 02:51.772
Hello.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.140
[ring]

02:53.241 --> 02:55.309
She's not home,
Lieutenant Fitzgerald.

02:55.376 --> 02:59.413
Because I could tell
by the sound of your ring.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.650
Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Zelda's not here right now.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.685
No, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.
She's not back yet.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.354
Yes. Yes, I'll let her
know you called.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.555
Better call after 9

03:07.621 --> 03:09.557
unless you want
to antagonize the judge.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.892
I don't know what
to tell you. She's...

03:11.959 --> 03:13.594
It's that Fitzgerald boy.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.429
[whisper] I can't.
Not right now.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.299
No. She's not here.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.534
Yes. I'll tell her.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.136
Good Lord, Zelda,

03:23.271 --> 03:24.681
if you're not going
to talk to this boy,

03:24.705 --> 03:26.173
release him from your spell.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.875
Spare us from all
the constant ringing.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.278
I can't help it
if I'm never home.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.345
He's going to give up.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.281
No, he won't.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.916
I sure as heck would.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.380
There's a new picture
at the Strand.

04:06.447 --> 04:09.450
Oh, no. I saw it three times.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.985
We haven't been to
the arcade for a while.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.086
Miss Sayre!

04:13.153 --> 04:14.322
- Ha ha!
- What?

04:14.355 --> 04:15.589
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, Lord.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.325
Now don't get awful flushed.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.659
I'm not.

04:18.726 --> 04:19.726
Miss Sayre.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.928
Why, Lieutenant Fitzgerald.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.064
What in heaven's name
are you doing here?

04:24.131 --> 04:27.368
I thought you'd
be off doing military
maneuvers or something.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.235
What brings you to town?

04:28.336 --> 04:30.504
I'm looking for you.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.805
Seems you found me.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.941
I imagine I have Tootsie
to thank for that.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.044
Livye Hart, this is
Lieutenant Scott Fitzgerald.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.579
How do you do?

04:38.646 --> 04:41.048
Much better now that I've
found the elusive Miss Sayre.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.516
I'm hardly elusive,

04:42.583 --> 04:45.386
but life can be so
awfully distracting.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.687
In fact, I'm surprised

04:46.754 --> 04:48.197
you even have a moment
to chat with us,

04:48.221 --> 04:49.356
given how busy you must be

04:49.357 --> 04:50.824
with all that writing of yours.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.661
Mr. Fitzgerald's going to be
a famous writer some day.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.762
Really?

04:54.828 --> 04:57.164
Well, I would be rewriting
my novel right now,

04:57.230 --> 04:58.666
but I can't finish it

04:58.732 --> 05:00.834
because I find myself
inordinately concerned

05:00.901 --> 05:03.203
with your phone line,
Miss Sayre.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.706
No matter how many
times I'd call,

05:05.773 --> 05:08.442
somehow I can't
seem to find you in.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.844
Sounds like the problem's
not the phone line.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.846
What were you
calling about anyway?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.817
I know that you're, uh,
quite sought after.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.387
But I'm not going to be
stationed here forever,

05:20.388 --> 05:23.023
and I need to get
to know you better.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.762
Well, what are you
doing tonight?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.199
I understand your people

05:32.265 --> 05:34.301
are from up north,
Lieutenant Fitzgerald?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.469
Yes, sir.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.204
I hear it's mighty
cold up there.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.672
Biscuits?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.208
I will take the cold
over this heat

05:41.274 --> 05:43.010
any day of the week
and twice on Sunday.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.212
That's a fact. As soon
as this war's over,

05:45.278 --> 05:46.614
I'm moving back to New York.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.148
That's where my husband's from.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.550
It gets cold up there, too,

05:49.617 --> 05:51.057
but not nearly as cold
as Saint Paul.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.286
So what do your
people do up there?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.255
Fail, mostly.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.457
I beg your pardon?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.025
Daddy, this isn't a deposition.

05:58.091 --> 05:59.426
I'm simply asking.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.128
My father was a salesman.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.730
He was never much good at it.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.965
He had a talent
for disappointment

06:05.032 --> 06:07.768
that made me even more
determined to succeed.

06:07.835 --> 06:08.869
At what?

06:08.936 --> 06:11.238
Scott's a writer, Daddy.
I told you that.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.106
And writing is a real job?

06:13.173 --> 06:16.343
- I write poetry.
- My point exactly.

06:16.444 --> 06:18.278
And I write a column
for the newspaper.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.247
I get a paycheck every week.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.150
Last time I checked,
I was still supporting
all of you writers.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.787
Well, I guess the only one
who does anything of value
around here is old Dick.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.589
Now, baby, that's not nice.

06:28.656 --> 06:30.891
How much money do you
make anyway, Daddy?

06:30.958 --> 06:32.626
I'm sure Scott
would like to know

06:32.693 --> 06:34.828
what a person gets paid
to do a real job.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.297
Scott: I agree
with Judge Sayre.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.467
Writing is not a real job.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.034
Now until you get paid for it.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.704
But I plan on
getting paid a lot
for it some day.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.540
As soon as Scribner's
publishes my first novel.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.541
That's right.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.009
Now, Mark Twain,

06:49.076 --> 06:50.110
he was a millionaire.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.512
And Theodore Dreiser,

06:51.579 --> 06:53.981
they were voices
of their generations.

06:54.047 --> 06:56.884
You are going to be
our next Mark Twain?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.118
No, sir.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.655
I'm going to be the next
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.634
Well, your father
didn't care for me.

07:13.701 --> 07:17.505
Ah, he doesn't care much for
any boy that comes courting.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.507
Most boys are too scared
to talk to old Dick.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.209
And yet, knowing that,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.635
you threw me
right in there anyway.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.213
Well, after the professors
of Princeton,

07:26.279 --> 07:29.116
your father is a whoop
and a holler. I like him.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.720
If I were the judge,
I would lock you in a tower

07:32.786 --> 07:34.655
- like a princess.
- He already has.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.657
What do you think Montgomery is?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.291
It's a good place to be from.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.694
No buts about it.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.167
Well, hello, there, Zelda.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.969
Hey, John Sellers.
Hi, y'all.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.939
This is Lieutenant
Scott Fitzgerald.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.642
You got a cigarette
for me, John?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.548
How long you in town
for, Lieutenant?

08:01.615 --> 08:02.916
No telling.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.918
I'm expecting my orders any day.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.553
Scott's a writer.
That's what he does

08:06.554 --> 08:07.655
when he's not defending

08:07.721 --> 08:08.789
our country's honor.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.058
One of those Yankee
highbrows, huh?

08:11.124 --> 08:12.802
I went to college,
if that's what you mean.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.928
John Sellers was just telling us

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
about the new car
his daddy just got him.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.566
A Franklin Touring,
slick as all get-out.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.434
Cost more than $3,000.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.770
Well, whoop-Dee-Doo.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.605
Isn't there anything
more interesting

08:24.672 --> 08:26.106
to talk about than motorcars?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.741
Lieutenant Fitzgerald's
going to think

08:27.808 --> 08:30.477
we're all a bunch
of asinine clodhoppers.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.679
The thought never
crossed my mind.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.582
Come on. Let's scoot
before we get comfortable.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.919
You have a lot of friends.

08:38.986 --> 08:44.324
When I was 6, my mother threw
a birthday party for me.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.293
Invited every child in school.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.461
No one came.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.163
- Not even one?
- Nope.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.599
Not one.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.235
I ate the entire chocolate cake

08:55.302 --> 08:57.905
all by myself.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.808
And several candles.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.278
Oh, you are a heartless
woman, Zelda Sayre.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.747
I'm sorry,

09:06.814 --> 09:09.717
but that is the most
deliciously sad story

09:09.783 --> 09:11.618
I've ever heard.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.820
Well, don't be too sad.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.622
I made up for it in prep school.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.256
I was quite popular.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.625
Voted Most Blond.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.293
Come on.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.967
Man: Evening, Zelda.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.670
Evening,
Mr. and Mrs. Weaver.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.840
I went to school with her
granddaughter Delia.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.176
Does everyone in town know you?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.811
Pretty much.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.914
Okay.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.116
So tell me something
that I should know

09:43.183 --> 09:44.752
about you, Zelda Sayre.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.654
Hmm. I'm extremely talented

09:47.655 --> 09:49.322
at talking my way
out of trouble.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.658
Oh. Are you now?

09:51.659 --> 09:54.094
And, uh, I've played hooky

09:54.161 --> 09:55.963
from high school
nearly every day

09:56.029 --> 09:58.766
and still managed to graduate
with a high B average.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.702
- Hmm.
- And there's my lips.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.804
They're quite famous.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.807
Rumor has it I have the most
kissable mouth in town.

10:08.909 --> 10:12.345
By the look of it,
I can't disagree.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.284
That's not exactly
a virtue in this town.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.586
Everybody knows
everybody else's business.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.888
It's exhausting.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.690
You want to know what I think?

10:22.756 --> 10:25.458
I think that these people
that supposedly know you

10:25.525 --> 10:26.660
don't know you at all.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.361
Oh, really?

10:28.428 --> 10:29.730
Yes.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.132
I look at the bluebloods
trying to impress you

10:32.199 --> 10:35.035
with their cars
and their legacies.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.636
But they don't have
the faintest idea

10:36.704 --> 10:39.406
of who you really are.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.711
And you're different?

10:43.777 --> 10:47.047
We move and breathe
in the same world, Zelda,

10:47.114 --> 10:49.549
and it's not
Montgomery, Alabama,

10:49.616 --> 10:51.819
or Saint Paul, Minnesota.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.023
Is that why you
asked me to dance?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.894
I saw you before anything
else in that room.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.642
This is crazy nuts.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.845
What are you doing?

11:17.911 --> 11:20.413
I'm commemorating that night.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.315
This place will forever be known

11:22.382 --> 11:24.151
as the place we met.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.119
It's historic.

11:26.186 --> 11:30.824
There. Now no one
will forget us.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.193
Why are your initials

11:33.260 --> 11:35.796
so much bigger than mine,
Scott Fitzgerald?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.243
Hey.

12:23.310 --> 12:24.411
Here's one more.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.620
Hand me another cookie.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.888
Chocolate this time.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.261
That Theda Bara
wears too much make-up.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.032
- Mm.
- [chuckle]

12:45.098 --> 12:47.901
Did you see your Yankee
again last night?

12:47.968 --> 12:51.171
He's not my Yankee, but yes.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.840
We went swimming in the lake.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.741
Just you two?

12:54.842 --> 12:55.943
Of course, silly.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.510
Your mama know?

12:57.577 --> 13:00.080
You think I'd tell my mama?

13:00.147 --> 13:03.116
I think John Sellers
is a little jealous.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.185
Doesn't know why you're
spending so much time

13:05.252 --> 13:07.120
with Lieutenant Fitzgerald.

13:07.187 --> 13:09.456
I'll say
that John Sellers'
mooning about.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.292
So what's he like?

13:12.359 --> 13:14.361
Your Yankee.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.963
He's so handsome,

13:16.029 --> 13:20.400
and he seems smart and mature,

13:20.467 --> 13:23.270
not like most of the boys
around here.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.008
Well, he certainly
is full of himself.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.711
He's a good kisser.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.081
Zelda. [giggling]

13:42.755 --> 13:43.991
[knock on door]

13:47.027 --> 13:49.562
Scott, go to the side door.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.440
Scott.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.976
This is nuts.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.577
What in the name of heaven

14:04.644 --> 14:06.179
do you think you're doing?

14:06.246 --> 14:08.248
I'm doing what
a fellow has to do

14:08.315 --> 14:10.617
when he's trying to avoid
the swarm of suitors

14:10.683 --> 14:12.819
panhandling on your veranda.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.721
Well, go ahead and make
yourself comfortable,

14:14.787 --> 14:16.289
why don't you?

14:16.356 --> 14:18.258
[grunt]

14:18.325 --> 14:21.094
I like it. It's colorful,
like its occupant.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.930
Shh! Keep your voice down.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.032
My daddy would have you
strung up and horsewhipped

14:25.098 --> 14:25.999
if he found you up here.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.935
It would be worth it.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.538
Is this any good?

14:31.604 --> 14:34.607
I don't know. You tell me.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.012
"Boone said last night

14:39.079 --> 14:41.848
"that I was the pinkest,
whitest person

14:41.949 --> 14:44.151
"he ever laid eyes on,

14:44.217 --> 14:46.419
"so I dropped off
to sleep in his lap

14:46.486 --> 14:49.622
"under the dusky,
dreamy smell of...

14:49.689 --> 14:52.192
dying moons and shadows."

14:57.464 --> 14:59.199
What are you really doing here?

15:02.835 --> 15:04.437
They just gave us our orders.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.406
We're shipping off
to New Jersey next week

15:06.473 --> 15:08.108
and then immediately
off to France.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.977
No.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.313
I... I was hoping we'd
have more time together.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.983
So was I.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.687
[clock ticking]

15:26.759 --> 15:29.329
I'm playing chess with
Jim Mayfield later, Minnie.

15:29.396 --> 15:32.032
We've got to move this along.
Jim's in bed by 9.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.366
I'll go fetch her.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.068
No, I'll go.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.570
Zelda, it's dinnertime.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.032
I like to cry.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.534
All my ancestors are here.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.303
Makes me feel a part
of something bigger.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.844
Well, maybe this is
the spirit of your
great-grandmother.

16:17.910 --> 16:21.048
I hope not. She was
a mean old buzzard.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.655
It all seems so futile,
doesn't it?

16:29.922 --> 16:31.924
We all end up here eventually.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.360
Stop that.

16:33.426 --> 16:37.230
There's nothing hopeless
in having to live.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.666
Think of the lives
these people had,

16:39.732 --> 16:42.202
the loves they shared.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.604
How could any of it be in vain

16:44.671 --> 16:46.606
when it's all so miraculous?

16:46.673 --> 16:50.210
Oh, in the end, I guess
we're just humans,

16:50.277 --> 16:55.148
drunk on the idea that
love can fix everything.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.417
Because it can.

17:01.288 --> 17:07.527
You are the finest, loveliest,

17:07.594 --> 17:11.098
most glorious person
I've ever met.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.223
I have something for you.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.130
This is a chapter from my novel.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.166
I wanted...

17:46.233 --> 17:48.535
you to have something
to remember me by.

17:50.303 --> 17:54.274
I could never forget you,
Scott Fitzgerald.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.881
Baby's going to be fine.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.583
I remember when she came back

18:03.650 --> 18:06.219
from her first day
at Childan Elementary.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.755
Said it was worse than prison.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.856
[both chuckling]

18:11.358 --> 18:13.293
And then she refused to go back

18:13.360 --> 18:16.028
until I threatened
to get the switch.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.731
Well, she's too old
for the switch now.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.168
I know. I know it.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.670
[sigh]

18:28.408 --> 18:32.712
Well, Zelda's going to do
what she's going to do.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.916
You sure you want to do this?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.618
Yes.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.732
Fanny Brice:
♫ After you've gone ♫

19:59.799 --> 20:05.171
♫ After you've gone away ♫

20:05.238 --> 20:08.441
♫ Away ♫

20:09.442 --> 20:13.079
♫ After you've gone ♫

20:13.145 --> 20:15.448
♫ And left me crying ♫

20:15.515 --> 20:19.185
♫ After you've gone ♫

20:19.252 --> 20:22.054
♫ There's no denying ♫

20:22.121 --> 20:25.057
♫ You'll feel blue ♫

20:25.124 --> 20:28.194
♫ You'll feel sad ♫

20:28.261 --> 20:34.133
♫ You'll miss the greatest
pal you've ever had ♫

20:34.200 --> 20:37.604
♫ There'll come a time ♫

20:37.670 --> 20:40.239
♫ Now don't forget it ♫

20:40.307 --> 20:42.775
Zelda, narrating:
I don't suppose I really
knew him very well.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.712
♫ ...time
when you regret it ♫

20:45.778 --> 20:48.014
But I knew he smelled
like the damp grass

20:48.080 --> 20:49.782
that grows near old moss.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.318
♫ Think what you're doin' ♫

20:51.384 --> 20:53.720
And that my cheek just fit

20:53.786 --> 20:55.622
the depression in his shoulder.

20:55.688 --> 21:00.493
♫ ...will drive me to ruin ♫

21:00.560 --> 21:04.331
♫ After you've gone ♫

21:04.397 --> 21:10.102
♫ After you've gone away ♫

21:10.169 --> 21:11.938
Fitzgerald!

21:12.004 --> 21:13.339
Johnson!

21:13.340 --> 21:15.107
Moore!

21:15.174 --> 21:16.709
Hey, hey! Fitzgerald!

21:16.776 --> 21:18.478
- Fitzgerald!
- Here you go.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.348
- Gilbert!
- Here.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.849
Aberdeen!

21:35.362 --> 21:36.596
Damn!

21:48.007 --> 21:50.910
You're drunk.
Get out of here, boy.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.447
Just take your hands off me!

21:54.514 --> 21:56.516
I'm Francis Scott Key
Fitzgerald!

21:56.583 --> 21:58.385
I'm going to be famous some day,

21:58.418 --> 22:01.754
while you... you, sir, are still
going to be cracking bottles

22:01.821 --> 22:03.656
in this stupid piss hole.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.663
Take it up somewhere else.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.298
Zelda: For the life of me,

22:12.399 --> 22:14.200
I don't know what you're
talking about, Daddy.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.603
Scott Fitzgerald
is the best man I know.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.406
He's intelligent and caring
and a gentleman.

22:20.407 --> 22:21.847
And he's going
to be a famous writer.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.010
A famous writer.
Yes, so he says.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.845
What exactly has he written?

22:25.912 --> 22:28.415
As a judge, I've written
more than he has.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.849
Dear, he's young.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.884
Zelda, you've only
known this young man

22:31.951 --> 22:33.252
for a few months.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.021
What do you really
know about him

22:35.087 --> 22:37.056
besides what he's told you?

22:37.123 --> 22:40.460
He knows who he is
and what he wants.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.128
And he cares what I think

22:42.194 --> 22:43.763
about everything.

22:43.830 --> 22:45.765
And that's enough for me.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.867
He's confident and fearless.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.636
He's an Irish Yankee hellraiser

22:49.702 --> 22:52.271
is what he is, Zelda.
Catholic, no doubt.

22:52.338 --> 22:53.906
And way too fond of his liquor,

22:53.973 --> 22:55.808
and he's about to be
shipped off to war

22:55.875 --> 22:59.178
with no apparent
prospects afterwards...

22:59.245 --> 23:00.613
if he comes back at all.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.148
Well, guess what.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.716
I'm not your baby anymore.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.952
And it's not your
decision to make.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.654
I'll do what I want.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.288
You know what you are?

23:09.355 --> 23:11.023
You're a narrow-minded
pallbearer

23:11.090 --> 23:12.458
who wants to lock me up

23:12.459 --> 23:14.594
in this morbid Southern
coffin of a town

23:14.661 --> 23:16.295
for the rest of my life.

23:16.362 --> 23:18.164
Well, I won't have it.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.032
I'll be with him
if I want to be.

23:20.099 --> 23:22.835
That boy isn't
who you think he is.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.171
You'll be making
a terrible mistake.

23:25.237 --> 23:26.506
[scoff]

23:26.573 --> 23:28.675
Well, it won't
be the first time.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.120
Hey, Fitzgerald!

23:44.524 --> 23:46.292
Fitzgerald, move your ass up.

23:46.358 --> 23:47.527
What's going on?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.061
You slept through the briefing.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.865
We got orders to be
at the train station
at 1400 hours.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.834
Ah, shit.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.070
Zelda:
Oh, Your play, Matilde.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.072
[laughing]

24:33.139 --> 24:35.407
[chatter]

24:35.542 --> 24:36.943
Scott!

24:38.545 --> 24:42.081
Scott.
How did you find me?

24:42.148 --> 24:43.182
What's wrong?

24:43.249 --> 24:44.316
My orders have changed.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.352
- I'm moving out.
- When?

24:46.418 --> 24:48.254
Today. Now.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.756
Now?

24:49.822 --> 24:51.758
I couldn't leave
without seeing you, Zelda.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.560
- [panting]
- Well, we have to speak.

24:53.626 --> 24:54.961
I didn't get a chance

24:55.027 --> 24:56.428
to talk to you about your book.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.430
It doesn't matter.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.099
Scribner's rejected it.
It's dead.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.570
How could that be?
It's brilliant.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.071
The language, the feeling.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.640
They didn't seem to think so.
It doesn't matter.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.351
Who cares is I'm going
to be a writer or not

25:09.375 --> 25:10.777
if I'm going off to die?

25:10.843 --> 25:13.379
None of it matters
except for you, Zelda.

25:13.445 --> 25:14.914
You're everything.

25:22.689 --> 25:26.859
I care if you're a writer.

25:26.926 --> 25:29.361
You can't give up your dreams.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.997
It's who you are.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.901
The only thing that I know,
darling girl,

25:34.967 --> 25:37.436
is without you
nothing's possible.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.172
- Scott...
- Zelda, I need you.

25:42.909 --> 25:44.043
Marry me.

25:48.414 --> 25:49.649
You don't need me.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.884
You don't need anybody.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.420
You're as good a writer
as there is,

25:54.486 --> 25:55.622
Scott Fitzgerald.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.489
No, without you I'm nothing.

25:57.624 --> 25:59.291
I'm less than nothing.

25:59.358 --> 26:03.062
Is that really what you
want me to think?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.767
Because that's not the man
I thought you were.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.368
You're not a quitter.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.203
Zelda, I am going off to war.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.839
I may never see you again.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.240
Please.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.643
Please, please.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.510
Marry me.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.212
I can't.
