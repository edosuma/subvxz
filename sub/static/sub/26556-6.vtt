00:01.059 --> 00:02.211
<i>Previously on "Arrow"...</i>

00:02.211 --> 00:04.070
- And you want my help.
- Yeah. I never thought this day

00:04.070 --> 00:05.264
would come either,
but here we are.

00:05.264 --> 00:07.382
- Time to go, inmate.
- Where are you taking me?

00:07.382 --> 00:08.867
You're going back to level one.

00:08.867 --> 00:11.403
- Where did you get this?
- Felicity.

00:11.403 --> 00:13.005
She's the one who
sent us to star city.

00:13.005 --> 00:15.050
I'm so sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

00:15.094 --> 00:16.922
but Felicity Smoak is dead.

00:16.965 --> 00:20.186
Just making good
on an old promise.

00:20.229 --> 00:23.015
Isn't that right, Anatoly?

00:33.982 --> 00:35.984
You, uh...

00:36.028 --> 00:38.944
You remember the last time
we saw each other?

00:38.987 --> 00:42.991
You killed my brothers,
all of them.

00:43.035 --> 00:48.475
Let me, um... let me
jog your memory.

00:48.518 --> 00:51.304
You betrayed me...

00:55.264 --> 00:58.528
After I trusted you...

01:00.922 --> 01:02.663
I gave you my friendship.

01:02.706 --> 01:07.973
Man like you has no friends.

01:08.538 --> 01:11.803
Where are your friends now?

01:12.815 --> 01:15.165
Huh?

01:15.340 --> 01:18.735
Oliver Queen!

01:19.010 --> 01:20.490
No!

01:21.409 --> 01:23.237
The Arrow team...

01:26.469 --> 01:29.733
They're all gone, brother.

01:34.782 --> 01:38.568
You picked the losing side.

01:38.612 --> 01:41.335
What are you waiting for?

01:41.335 --> 01:43.835
Kill me!

01:45.967 --> 01:50.580
Not yet. I got
a little job for you.

01:51.190 --> 01:52.904
You're gonna help me

01:52.904 --> 01:57.065
destroy Oliver Queen.

02:02.196 --> 02:04.296
<b>- <font color="#00FF00">Arrow S07E06</font> -</b>

02:04.321 --> 02:07.202
- Synced & corrected by: <font color="#008000">Rockstone</font> -

02:09.395 --> 02:12.691
I thought that mind control
stuff only happened in movies.

02:12.691 --> 02:14.736
It wasn't exactly mind control.

02:15.687 --> 02:18.341
This place seems like
it's gotten a lot worse.

02:18.385 --> 02:20.822
They came in after you
stabbed that guard.

02:20.866 --> 02:22.650
These guys are
professional jerks.

02:22.694 --> 02:26.156
Less yard time, cell
checks every half-hour.

02:26.156 --> 02:29.858
- Have they been rough on you?
- Me? No way.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.555
I'm glad they're here.

02:31.599 --> 02:34.341
Brick's been pissed ever since
you shut down his fight club,

02:34.384 --> 02:35.777
and I'm the only one
he can take it out on.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.737
If they weren't here,
he'd have come after me.

02:38.780 --> 02:43.698
You totally saved me.
Typical green Arrow move.

02:50.723 --> 02:52.890
Pick it up.

02:54.199 --> 02:56.493
I thought Dunbar was
on Brick's payroll.

02:56.493 --> 02:59.304
Not anymore. Ever since
that fight club fiasco,

02:59.304 --> 03:00.783
Dunbar's got a slap
on the wrist.

03:00.827 --> 03:04.242
Now he treats Brick
like, well, you.

03:04.242 --> 03:06.157
On your feet, 4587.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.115
- Speaking of.
- Time to go.

03:08.159 --> 03:10.422
Have my meal privileges
been revoked?

03:10.465 --> 03:13.860
I said, let's go, inmate.

03:13.904 --> 03:17.646
- Err.
- I'm not telling you again.

03:22.227 --> 03:23.745
That's what I thought.

03:23.745 --> 03:24.790
You have a visitor.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.331
I thought I didn't
have any visitation.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.315
Well, it must be your lucky day.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.959
What do you want?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.037
Try sounding a little
bit more grateful, Ollie.

03:48.037 --> 03:49.804
I had to file
an emergency motion

03:49.804 --> 03:51.304
just to get in here to see you,

03:51.304 --> 03:53.698
and it's a good thing
that I did because you

03:53.749 --> 03:55.621
look like crap.

03:55.664 --> 03:57.231
Just need to document...

03:57.266 --> 03:59.703
- Hey.
- Your injuries really fast.

03:59.755 --> 04:02.476
- What are you doing?
- We got the level two psych records

04:02.476 --> 04:05.087
from wherever or whoever you had
sneak them out of Slabside.

04:05.130 --> 04:06.713
How did you do that,
by the way?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.423
No, no. Never mind.
Don't tell me.

04:08.423 --> 04:10.267
It's better for your case
if I don't know.

04:10.267 --> 04:11.616
What do you mean, my case?

04:11.660 --> 04:13.879
- Your case.
- What... what are you working

04:13.923 --> 04:15.272
with Jean Loring?

04:15.315 --> 04:19.406
No. I'm working
with your wife.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.628
Felicity would have told me
if she was working with you,

04:23.672 --> 04:26.805
and the only reason that
you would ever help me

04:26.849 --> 04:31.636
or anyone is if there was
something in it for you.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.246
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

04:34.495 --> 04:37.980
You're the reason that Diaz
got away in the first place.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.287
Do you remember?

04:40.605 --> 04:43.216
You know, the Ollie I knew...

04:43.909 --> 04:49.179
...he had a hard time taking
responsibility for his failures, too.

04:49.222 --> 04:52.313
You know what's amazing?

04:53.662 --> 04:56.096
You're nothing like her.

04:56.096 --> 05:00.274
So go ahead and
pretend to be Laurel,

05:00.318 --> 05:03.321
my Laurel, for
as long as you want.

05:03.854 --> 05:08.511
You never will be, ever.

05:08.555 --> 05:11.949
Stay away from my wife.

05:23.744 --> 05:27.574
I can't believe she's dead.

05:28.638 --> 05:30.640
Here.

05:32.443 --> 05:35.902
- I don't really drink.
- Well, I do.

05:37.850 --> 05:40.037
So what happened?

05:40.037 --> 05:41.169
How did she die?

05:41.212 --> 05:43.217
It was a couple weeks ago,

05:43.217 --> 05:44.392
give or take.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.305
She was murdered.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.640
- Murdered?
- Who would hurt Felicity?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.852
Roy, the Felicity you knew
was very different

05:51.852 --> 05:53.810
than what she became.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.314
We wanted her to join us,

05:56.314 --> 05:57.445
but she cut ties.

05:57.489 --> 05:58.925
Instead, she went underground.

05:58.968 --> 06:00.923
She started calling
herself The Calculator.

06:00.923 --> 06:02.403
- Like her father?
- She ran in some

06:02.446 --> 06:03.697
dangerous circles.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.973
You walk that path long enough,

06:04.973 --> 06:07.802
sooner or later,
it catches up to you.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.488
I'm sorry, William.

06:11.532 --> 06:14.056
However Felicity died,

06:14.100 --> 06:16.885
whatever the circumstances,

06:16.929 --> 06:19.888
she still sent me this signal,

06:19.932 --> 06:21.281
and I need to know why.

06:22.638 --> 06:24.676
You don't owe her
anything, William.

06:24.701 --> 06:26.887
Yeah? Well, maybe
she owed me.

06:28.549 --> 06:30.203
Ok. I noticed
this earlier.

06:30.247 --> 06:32.031
You see the color variation?

06:32.075 --> 06:33.859
I think Felicity was
trying to lead us there.

06:33.903 --> 06:37.489
This is kind of crazy.
You know that, right?

06:37.489 --> 06:39.952
All I know is
I've come this far.

06:39.996 --> 06:42.781
I'm not stopping now.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.887
Has the Silencer's flight
touched down from Moscow yet?

06:54.924 --> 06:56.708
An hour ago in star city
just like we thought.

06:56.751 --> 06:59.461
My facial recognition algorithm
indicates she hasn't had a rendezvous

06:59.461 --> 07:02.257
yet with Diaz,
but I did get an update

07:02.257 --> 07:04.546
on why Diaz sent
The Silencer to Russia.

07:04.546 --> 07:07.135
- Anatoly Knyazev?
- I can't get specific confirmation,

07:07.135 --> 07:08.635
but the rumor on the
dark web is that

07:08.635 --> 07:10.166
the entire Bratva
was massacred

07:10.166 --> 07:12.070
two nights ago in Moscow.

07:12.549 --> 07:16.117
Which doesn't bode well
for our frenemy Anatoly.

07:17.346 --> 07:18.783
How'd things go with Oliver?
Is he ok?

07:18.783 --> 07:19.799
He's fine.

07:19.799 --> 07:21.358
He hates me, he thinks
I'm a monster,

07:21.358 --> 07:22.567
and he doesn't want my help,

07:22.591 --> 07:23.916
- but he's fine.
- Oh. Ok. Listen.

07:23.916 --> 07:26.369
I mean, prison's obviously
been rough on Oliver.

07:26.369 --> 07:27.791
I mean, that's the whole
point of prison. Duh!

07:27.791 --> 07:30.200
But he doesn't know the new you.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.814
I mean, he just knows the old,
scarier, murdery version of you.

07:34.857 --> 07:36.990
I don't really care what
Oliver thinks of me,

07:37.033 --> 07:38.687
but he doesn't want me
representing him,

07:38.746 --> 07:41.229
and I don't know how quickly you're
gonna find substitute counsel.

07:41.229 --> 07:43.013
No way. We are not changing
our strategy, not now.

07:43.057 --> 07:45.102
Oliver's constitutional
rights were violated.

07:45.146 --> 07:47.670
A prosecutor stepping over to the
opposite side of the line to defend him

07:47.713 --> 07:49.672
is the best leverage
that we have.

07:51.848 --> 07:53.241
I just got a hit.

07:53.284 --> 07:55.112
Diaz and the 3
longbow hunters were spotted

07:55.156 --> 07:56.722
outside a munitions plant
in Orchid Bay.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.548
He's probably looking
for some kind of weapon.

08:00.591 --> 08:03.358
Too bad he's not gonna live
long enough to get it.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.144
We have to move
before they change locations.

08:09.495 --> 08:13.499
Why do bad guys always
pick the creepiest places?

08:13.542 --> 08:15.635
Oh, wait. Was that
a serious question?

08:15.635 --> 08:17.550
Well, I mean, you used to
be a bad guy... well, gal,

08:17.593 --> 08:19.148
- so I figured you'd know.
- This doesn't look like

08:19.148 --> 08:22.480
- official D.A. Business.
- Did we have to invite him?

08:23.069 --> 08:25.588
- Are you two, like, friends now?
- It's a long story,

08:25.588 --> 08:28.091
but the punch line is that the
Silencer and Diaz are inside,

08:28.091 --> 08:30.402
which means we're finally gonna
get a chance to bring them down.

08:30.402 --> 08:32.972
And you know this how?
Oh, wait.

08:33.015 --> 08:34.191
Let me guess.
Long story.

08:34.234 --> 08:36.976
Can we just leave it at that?

08:37.019 --> 08:40.631
- So are you in?
- You really got to ask?

08:42.808 --> 08:44.331
Where the hell is she?

08:44.375 --> 08:47.943
According to my tracker,
she's... she's in there.

09:15.232 --> 09:17.451
- Bomb!
- Go, go, move, move,

09:17.495 --> 09:19.018
move, move, move!

09:36.633 --> 09:38.532
A.R.G.U.S. has been
tracking Diaz ever since

09:38.532 --> 09:40.098
he slaughtered
the Bratva in Russia.

09:40.142 --> 09:43.360
The SCPD was responding to a
munitions plant break-in.

09:43.360 --> 09:44.907
So please tell me, Felicity,
how the hell

09:44.907 --> 09:47.055
do you end up in
the middle of my op again?

09:47.055 --> 09:49.101
Why don't I just say
exponential search algorithm,

09:49.145 --> 09:50.798
and we'll just leave it at that?

09:50.842 --> 09:53.601
We planted a tracker
on the Silencer's belt.

09:53.601 --> 09:55.341
Obviously, Diaz must
have found it

09:55.385 --> 09:57.169
and is using it
as bait against us.

09:57.213 --> 09:58.681
How did you manage that?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.640
You were nowhere near the
Silencer at the CDC.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.642
That thing at
the CDC was you guys?

10:03.269 --> 10:06.448
Uh, Felicity wasn't near her.
I was.

10:06.448 --> 10:08.145
We snuck her out together.

10:08.189 --> 10:10.193
So you two
captured the silencer?

10:10.193 --> 10:12.643
But Felicity and Laurel were
the ones that tortured her.

10:12.643 --> 10:15.440
Actually, I convinced her not to.
You're welcome.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.699
So now you're
working with Laurel?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.854
- I'm standing right here.
- To be fair, she did help

10:18.854 --> 10:21.204
shut down that illegal
psychiatric program at Slabside.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.213
Wait. Hold on a sec.
You're gonna give me

10:23.213 --> 10:25.041
crap about working with
the new green Arrow,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.221
and meanwhile, you're siding
with the Black Frickin' Siren?

10:27.221 --> 10:28.920
Again, still here.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.400
You're working
with the new green Arrow?

10:30.443 --> 10:32.799
Guys, I think
that the whole point of this

10:32.799 --> 10:35.934
is that maybe we could all pick
up our phones a little more, huh,

10:35.934 --> 10:37.023
shoot a text.

10:37.066 --> 10:38.755
Yeah. I am totally
talking about the fact

10:38.755 --> 10:40.739
that everyone forgot
my birthday last week.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.528
Your party is next week.
Act surprised!

10:42.528 --> 10:44.942
Ok. Now that all of our
deep, dark secrets are out,

10:44.942 --> 10:47.313
do you think that we could switch
our focus back to the psycho

10:47.313 --> 10:50.150
- who just tried to blow us up?
- Sounds like good idea.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.661
First, ground rules.
No new Green Arrow.

10:52.661 --> 10:55.838
Secondly, no one who
isn't from this Earth.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.534
- You're kicking me out?
- Well, you are the D.A.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.035
You could have been
exposed tonight,

11:01.035 --> 11:03.228
and I think there's
no need to risk that again.

11:03.228 --> 11:06.916
So an international
mob boss gets to stay

11:06.916 --> 11:09.963
and I have to leave, is that it?

11:11.616 --> 11:12.922
Huh! Unbelievable.

11:12.966 --> 11:14.434
- Laurel, wait.
- Dasvidaniya.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.925
Laurel, please wait.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.488
It looks like you and your husband
don't need my help after all.

11:18.488 --> 11:20.805
He does, we do, I do,
but, more importantly,

11:20.805 --> 11:22.546
I need the D.A.
To help Oliver.

11:22.590 --> 11:24.896
Well, I was happy to help
your little charity case

11:24.940 --> 11:28.291
when I had some downtime, but now
that Diaz is back in, I don't.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.859
Laurel, Laurel, please!

11:30.902 --> 11:32.643
If I could trade places with you

11:32.687 --> 11:35.472
so that you could
go get Diaz, I would,

11:35.515 --> 11:37.883
but this is my only chance
to get Oliver out of prison.

11:37.883 --> 11:40.755
This is it! This...

11:42.188 --> 11:44.789
This is my only chance
to get my husband back.

11:44.789 --> 11:47.531
Laurel, please.

11:48.215 --> 11:52.101
You know, sometimes, I really
hate being your Laurel.

11:53.305 --> 11:57.701
I promise you that when we
catch Diaz, I will call you

11:57.744 --> 12:00.602
and we will finish this
just like we planned.

12:00.602 --> 12:03.039
Fine.

12:05.574 --> 12:07.852
We're close. Should be
just up here.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.081
All these years, and you're
still that boy who hates

12:10.081 --> 12:11.561
not knowing stuff.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.995
Are you still that girl who
loves getting into trouble?

12:13.995 --> 12:16.214
You know it.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.155
It's good seeing you.

12:19.155 --> 12:22.771
I tried to keep in touch
after everything.

12:22.771 --> 12:26.731
Yeah, I know.
Guess it was just easier

12:26.775 --> 12:29.038
for me to move on
than to hold on, you know?

12:29.081 --> 12:31.823
Wish I could do
the same sometimes.

12:31.867 --> 12:34.304
I cannot believe that
they're full-grown adults.

12:34.347 --> 12:36.214
Which means we're old.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.882
I never thought I'd
see you again.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.301
This is the last place I ever
thought I'd come back to.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.259
I wanted William
to leave me on Lian Yu.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.261
How did he convince you?

12:45.138 --> 12:48.309
I found a message
inside of Oliver's bow...

12:48.601 --> 12:49.701
...the Mark of four.

12:49.745 --> 12:52.412
That's impossible.
Who could've put it there?

12:52.412 --> 12:55.149
I don't know,
but I think it's best

12:55.149 --> 12:56.584
that we keep this between us.

12:56.584 --> 12:59.028
None of us have seen
William for years.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.756
- You sure we can trust him?
- He's Oliver's son.

13:01.756 --> 13:04.225
That is exactly what worries me.

13:04.225 --> 13:06.452
Hey. According
to the map, it's only

13:06.452 --> 13:09.281
a few hundred more
feet this way.

13:26.085 --> 13:27.937
- Let's go, inmate.
- What? Where?

13:27.937 --> 13:30.344
Oh, you're going
to the hole permanently.

13:30.344 --> 13:31.586
Hey.
What's going on?

13:31.586 --> 13:33.906
Officer Dunbar was
killed last night,

13:33.906 --> 13:36.031
and this little bastard was
the last one seen with him.

13:36.031 --> 13:38.294
What?! I didn't kill anybody.
It wasn't me!

13:38.345 --> 13:41.617
- Wait. How do you know it was him?
- Oliver, it wasn't me, I swear!

13:41.617 --> 13:44.115
It must have been Brick!
He set me up!

13:44.115 --> 13:47.553
Oliver! Oliver!

13:48.896 --> 13:50.898
Look who just got out
of the loony bin.

13:50.941 --> 13:52.900
You learn any
life lessons in there?

13:52.943 --> 13:55.641
Maybe those doctors helped
get your head on straight.

13:55.685 --> 13:57.905
Tell me what you know
about Dunbar's murder.

13:57.948 --> 13:59.904
Sounds like you're
accusing us of something.

13:59.904 --> 14:02.884
I heard the poor chap
got stabbed 8 times.

14:02.884 --> 14:03.885
Messy way to go.

14:03.929 --> 14:05.626
You and he had
a falling out, Brick.

14:06.022 --> 14:08.131
Maybe we did,
and maybe we didn't.

14:08.131 --> 14:10.936
Maybe an innocent man is rotting
in the hole in your place.

14:10.936 --> 14:12.850
There are no innocent men
in here, Queen.

14:12.850 --> 14:17.315
- You should know that.
- Brick, Stanley didn't kill that guard.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.567
Well, I guess he's got
nothing to worry about.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.526
The truth will set him free.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.124
Go ahead.

14:25.943 --> 14:28.686
Then you can join your
friend in the hole.

14:31.217 --> 14:33.088
Hey, Brick.

14:33.131 --> 14:35.482
If you or anyone in your crew

14:35.525 --> 14:42.228
had something to do with
this, I'll find out.

14:45.535 --> 14:47.494
Come on.

14:49.085 --> 14:51.663
Meet Pyotr Roslov...

14:51.663 --> 14:55.645
Former KGB, lots of deep, scary ties
to the Russian military.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.105
Oh. He looks like
a real charmer.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.544
Hmm. He is not. Pyotr and I
were associates at KGB,

15:00.587 --> 15:03.242
but we had a disagreement.

15:03.694 --> 15:05.435
Then why did Diaz
have you call him?

15:05.479 --> 15:08.577
Diaz wants to buy some kind of
very powerful weapon from him.

15:08.577 --> 15:10.013
He wants to destroy Oliver Queen

15:10.056 --> 15:12.910
by destroying
what he loves, his city.

15:12.910 --> 15:15.164
That's why Diaz
was trying to steal

15:15.164 --> 15:17.871
- the directed energy weapon.
- And whatever was at the CDC.

15:17.871 --> 15:20.586
We find out where Diaz plans to
launch his attack, we snag him there,

15:20.586 --> 15:23.458
we find out what Roslov
sold him,

15:23.502 --> 15:25.242
and you're gonna help us.

15:25.286 --> 15:27.677
No, no, no. No.
Pyotr can smell a rat.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.985
- Anatoly, we will help you.
- I play hero once before,

15:31.029 --> 15:33.894
and Diaz killed all of my
brothers as punishment.

15:33.894 --> 15:36.375
- Never again.
- Oliver was your brother, too,

15:36.418 --> 15:38.377
and he would want you
to help us get Diaz.

15:38.420 --> 15:40.379
Yeah, but Oliver tried
to do the same thing.

15:40.422 --> 15:41.791
Look where he is now.
No.

15:41.791 --> 15:43.791
Time for me to go
somewhere nice, tropical.

15:43.791 --> 15:44.836
Maldives maybe.

15:44.879 --> 15:46.489
I think it's
really hard to travel

15:46.533 --> 15:49.057
when you're on Homeland
Security's most wanted list.

15:49.101 --> 15:52.321
Yes, but I am on no such...

15:55.020 --> 15:56.499
You are threatening me?

15:56.543 --> 15:58.458
Call it an enthusiastic
suggestion.

15:58.501 --> 16:00.634
A couple minutes
in Roslov's office,

16:00.678 --> 16:02.027
you download his hard drive,

16:02.070 --> 16:03.637
you're on your way
to the Maldives.

16:03.681 --> 16:06.424
You're not Felicity Smoak
I remember.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.948
Well, she couldn't catch Diaz.

16:08.991 --> 16:11.342
Maybe this one can.

16:21.917 --> 16:24.616
I got a visual.

16:34.948 --> 16:36.787
Anatoly Knyazev.

16:52.861 --> 16:53.888
He's in.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.799
I suppose I owe
you a debt of gratitude

16:56.799 --> 16:59.280
for sending the dragon
my way, Knyazev.

16:59.323 --> 17:03.713
Oh. I'm pleased your dealings with
Mr. Diaz were, uh, profitable.

17:03.713 --> 17:06.585
Oh. Yes.
Very profitable.

17:06.628 --> 17:11.415
Speaking of, you need
4k TV, Sarin gas?

17:11.459 --> 17:14.941
All fall off truck, I swear.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.162
Anatoly, you need to
get to that computer.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.469
Eh, Pyotr, why don't we sit down

17:21.512 --> 17:24.080
like old friends?

17:24.994 --> 17:28.738
Good. Now distract him
and insert the drive.

17:30.244 --> 17:34.517
- Something wrong?
- I... I was promised drink.

17:39.226 --> 17:43.883
Um, on rocks...
Please.

17:50.368 --> 17:51.804
Good.

17:53.390 --> 17:56.453
He's got incoming. Anatoly's
been compromised.

17:56.478 --> 17:57.931
- We have to get him out of there.
- The drive still needs

17:57.931 --> 17:59.642
a minute before he can
retrieve the data.

17:59.642 --> 18:01.455
Felicity, he doesn't
have a minute.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.631
Anatoly, there is
no immediate threat.

18:03.681 --> 18:04.822
Keep him talking.

18:04.822 --> 18:07.461
Forgive me, Pyotr.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.854
Felicity!

18:08.897 --> 18:12.466
Losing Bratva was very painful.

18:12.466 --> 18:16.345
The pain taught me to see all
the pain that I have inflicted.

18:16.345 --> 18:21.780
I'm hoping that you can see it
in your heart to forgive me.

18:23.956 --> 18:27.002
A snake may shed its skin,

18:27.046 --> 18:31.050
but it is still a snake.

18:42.869 --> 18:44.373
Go!

19:06.172 --> 19:07.892
Anatoly.

19:07.892 --> 19:09.774
God. Yes. We got it.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.518
Damn it.

19:17.009 --> 19:19.212
Hey. How's Anatoly?

19:19.212 --> 19:21.415
He'll be out cold for a few
hours, but he'll be fine.

19:21.415 --> 19:23.134
- Good.
- Felicity, it wouldn't have been if

19:23.134 --> 19:25.095
- I showed up a few seconds later.
- But he is fine.

19:25.095 --> 19:26.329
And we got this.

19:26.329 --> 19:27.884
It's encrypted
and probably in cyrillic,

19:27.884 --> 19:29.332
so it's gonna take me
a while to decode,

19:29.375 --> 19:31.421
but it is a huge lead
on what Diaz is planning.

19:31.464 --> 19:33.493
And this would have been
worth Anatoly's life?

19:33.493 --> 19:34.829
Well, think about how many
lives we're gonna lose

19:34.829 --> 19:36.613
if we don't stop Diaz.

19:36.657 --> 19:38.615
We all have to take risks
in the field, Digg.

19:38.659 --> 19:40.763
That's true, but this was a risk

19:40.763 --> 19:42.619
that you coerced him
into taking, Felicity.

19:42.663 --> 19:45.404
I'm sorry that
he got hurt, I am,

19:45.448 --> 19:48.712
but we got intel on Diaz
because I didn't give up.

19:48.756 --> 19:51.410
Give up? Felicity,
I didn't give up.

19:51.454 --> 19:54.294
You pushed me out. You wanted
to do things your way,

19:54.294 --> 19:55.486
and I supported that decision,

19:55.486 --> 19:56.981
but that was before
I knew your decision

19:56.981 --> 19:59.907
- involved risking innocent lives.
- Anatoly is hardly a girl scout,

19:59.907 --> 20:03.814
and don't lecture me, especially
because you haven't been around.

20:04.341 --> 20:07.557
I am willing to do whatever
it takes to end this.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.906
But then what?

20:09.534 --> 20:11.735
Felicity, I've known you
for a long time,

20:11.779 --> 20:13.128
and you are a good person,

20:13.729 --> 20:15.165
but I've been
to the front lines,

20:15.209 --> 20:17.049
and I know exactly
what that does to people.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.313
I just hope when
this war is over,

20:20.356 --> 20:23.533
you still come out a hero.

20:42.596 --> 20:45.729
Hey. You ok?

20:46.287 --> 20:50.038
The guards, they took
turns hitting me.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.040
They think I killed
their friend.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.520
Stanley, did they say why?

20:53.563 --> 20:56.871
They haven't even found
the murder weapon.

20:56.915 --> 20:59.874
Dunbar's a jerk,
but I would never hurt him.

20:59.918 --> 21:01.876
I would never hurt anyone.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.574
Oliver, if they pin this on me,

21:04.618 --> 21:08.517
- I'm gonna be in here forever.
- Hey. I'm not gonna let that happen.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.885
I heard that it happened
in the shower.

21:10.929 --> 21:12.539
- Ok.
- But that doesn't even

21:12.582 --> 21:15.934
make sense because I wasn't even
close to there when that guy...

21:16.443 --> 21:20.503
I know if anyone can find
out what really happened,

21:20.865 --> 21:22.549
it's the Green Arrow.

21:22.592 --> 21:24.812
Just sit tight, ok?

21:25.246 --> 21:26.421
Ok.

22:15.849 --> 22:17.938
Of course.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.388
I'm sure you're
wondering what a state D.A.

22:23.388 --> 22:24.998
is doing here in federal court,

22:25.041 --> 22:27.609
representing someone on the
opposite side of the law.

22:27.653 --> 22:30.525
I am.
This is highly unusual.

22:30.569 --> 22:35.051
I'm here as an officer
of the court.

22:36.541 --> 22:41.938
This... is Oliver Queen's
current condition.

22:42.450 --> 22:45.435
He has been
psychologically tortured,

22:45.435 --> 22:47.959
harassed, and assaulted.

22:48.002 --> 22:50.788
Upon information and belief,
Mr. Queen also had

22:50.831 --> 22:52.485
the opportunity
to escape Slabside

22:52.529 --> 22:56.637
but instead smuggled information
out to help his fellow inmates.

22:56.637 --> 22:59.653
And you feel these things
should negate his conviction?

22:59.653 --> 23:02.177
Yes. Oliver Queen made
a deal with the FBI

23:02.221 --> 23:05.676
to protect his city,
but the FBI failed

23:05.676 --> 23:07.417
to hold up their end
of the bargain.

23:07.461 --> 23:10.222
Meanwhile, Diaz has
continued to commit

23:10.222 --> 23:12.354
numerous other crimes
and nearly succeeded

23:12.398 --> 23:15.052
in murdering Mr. Queen's
wife and child

23:15.096 --> 23:17.229
while they were
in federal witness protection.

23:17.272 --> 23:19.187
Anything further,
Ms. Lance?

23:19.231 --> 23:24.453
Your honor, the hardest
thing to do is to be a hero

23:24.497 --> 23:26.787
when no one expects you to be.

23:26.787 --> 23:29.050
The easier path
is to be a criminal.

23:29.093 --> 23:33.078
The past 6 months,
Oliver Queen has chosen

23:33.078 --> 23:36.332
the hard road and has been
a hero in terrible conditions,

23:36.332 --> 23:40.205
and since the FBI has not
held up their end of the deal,

23:40.249 --> 23:43.470
Oliver Queen deserves
to be a free man.

23:43.513 --> 23:45.994
I agree that
a federal investigation

23:46.037 --> 23:49.084
into the conditions
of Slabside should be ordered.

23:49.602 --> 23:53.515
However, I'm unconvinced that Mr. Queen
should be released at this time.

23:53.515 --> 23:56.039
Therefore,
his conviction stands.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.085
Your appeal is denied.

24:01.126 --> 24:02.837
Got your message.
Are you in?

24:02.837 --> 24:04.143
Felicity had the brilliant idea

24:04.187 --> 24:05.819
to use a cyrillic dictionary
attack on the table

24:05.819 --> 24:08.134
- of hashed passwords.
- It was pretty brilliant of me.

24:08.134 --> 24:10.814
Our friend Roslov, on the
other hand, less brilliant.

24:10.814 --> 24:13.869
His decryption key is the Russian
equivalent of "password69."

24:13.869 --> 24:16.664
Once we translated all the data,
this is what we got.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.333
Say hello to betab-500.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.267
Yeah. That's a top-of-the-line
aerial explosive,

24:21.267 --> 24:22.703
razor-thin precision,

24:22.747 --> 24:24.618
able to cut through
concrete like nothing.

24:24.662 --> 24:26.090
Well, Diaz has two of them,

24:26.090 --> 24:28.300
so that means our list of
potential targets just doubled.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.844
- Keep working on that hard drive.
- What are you gonna do?

24:30.844 --> 24:33.760
Prepare for a mass evac
of Star City.

24:41.994 --> 24:43.691
Why'd you do it, Turner?

24:43.734 --> 24:45.088
What the hell are
you talking about?

24:45.088 --> 24:46.219
Why'd you kill Dunbar?

24:46.263 --> 24:47.656
I didn't kill that guard.

24:47.699 --> 24:50.136
Your blade says you did.

24:53.674 --> 24:55.372
Guards found prints on it.

24:55.415 --> 24:57.809
Turner, you're going
to the hole,

24:57.852 --> 25:00.028
and this time, you're
never coming out.

25:00.072 --> 25:05.338
You did this? W-wait.
You got the wrong guy.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.337
You got the wrong guy!
I didn't do it!

25:19.010 --> 25:21.447
Hey. I heard
you were up.

25:22.025 --> 25:24.815
- How are you feeling?
- Heart pounding in head.

25:24.815 --> 25:28.533
Each beat... pow...
like knife to brain.

25:28.533 --> 25:32.763
I'm sorry. I should have
gotten you out sooner.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.723
So you are not new
Felicity Smoak after all.

25:37.564 --> 25:39.254
What do you mean?

25:39.955 --> 25:42.000
You want to be ruthless

25:42.044 --> 25:43.654
to pursue madman,

25:43.698 --> 25:45.221
I'll not judge you.

25:45.265 --> 25:47.567
I am, after all,
wanted criminal.

25:47.567 --> 25:50.841
I actually thought you'd be more
pissed I almost got you killed.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.489
Yeah. Of course
I'm angry.

25:52.533 --> 25:54.230
You threaten my life,

25:54.274 --> 25:56.232
but I don't like apologies.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.888
You cannot take away
mistake by wishing it so.

26:00.330 --> 26:03.065
In my line of work,
you make choice,

26:03.108 --> 26:04.719
you do not look back.

26:04.762 --> 26:09.593
Ah. So you don't regret working
against us with Diaz last year?

26:10.166 --> 26:16.600
Regret, guilt. These are demons
you choose to live with,

26:16.979 --> 26:19.473
a trade you make
to get what you want.

26:19.516 --> 26:21.953
How bad do you want
to kill Ricardo Diaz?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.520
More than anything.

26:23.564 --> 26:27.307
Well, then you embrace demons.

26:27.350 --> 26:29.918
No more half measures.

26:30.271 --> 26:33.748
When I work with Oliver
in Russia,

26:33.791 --> 26:35.271
he was not villain,

26:35.315 --> 26:38.972
but he did what
needed to be done.

26:38.972 --> 26:42.539
You remind me of him then.

26:44.037 --> 26:47.928
What would that Oliver
have done in this situation?

26:47.928 --> 26:50.547
He would have ended Diaz,

26:50.591 --> 26:54.377
and he wouldn't care
about the cost.

27:06.733 --> 27:09.692
Hey! Laurel,
you look a little upset.

27:09.743 --> 27:11.881
- Why don't we go cool off?
- Get out of my way.

27:11.881 --> 27:14.147
It seems like you were
about to open your mouth

27:14.147 --> 27:16.715
and do something you're
going to regret, counselor.

27:16.759 --> 27:18.282
I'm not an attorney,

27:18.326 --> 27:20.328
as you've reminded me
many times.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.286
You sure looked like one
in that courtroom today.

27:22.330 --> 27:25.115
Yeah. Well, it doesn't
matter, does it?

27:25.158 --> 27:26.986
Oliver's not getting
out of prison.

27:27.030 --> 27:28.510
Now, if you don't mind, I have

27:28.553 --> 27:30.903
some unfinished business
with that judge.

27:30.947 --> 27:33.297
Did you even bother to
listen to yourself in court?

27:33.341 --> 27:35.299
You spoke from your heart.

27:35.343 --> 27:37.127
Big surprise, by the way,
you do have one.

27:37.564 --> 27:40.103
You said, "the hardest
thing to do was to be a hero

27:40.103 --> 27:41.681
"when no one expects you to be.

27:41.681 --> 27:44.204
The easier path
is to be a criminal."

27:44.204 --> 27:46.267
What do you care, anyway?

27:46.267 --> 27:49.793
If anybody knows the
true me, the real me,

27:49.793 --> 27:51.342
it's you.

27:51.386 --> 27:53.736
You know, you've been telling
people for 6 months now

27:53.779 --> 27:54.954
you've changed.

27:54.998 --> 27:57.001
It wasn't until I saw
you in that courtroom

27:57.001 --> 27:59.219
that I actually believed it.

27:59.954 --> 28:03.789
Do not throw that away just
because it's getting hard now.

28:04.712 --> 28:10.318
I don't want you coming to one of
my court appearances ever again.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.369
This has to be
where Felicity was hiding out.

28:21.369 --> 28:25.286
- Yeah, but doing what?
- Uh, guys.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.506
You have triggered
security protocols.

28:27.549 --> 28:30.465
If you do not provide
access credentials

28:30.509 --> 28:32.467
in 30 seconds,

28:32.511 --> 28:35.296
you will be terminated.

28:36.901 --> 28:39.581
- All our weapons were targeted.
- Please say you can hack this.

28:39.581 --> 28:41.698
Hack Felicity?
Yeah, right!

28:43.557 --> 28:45.211
She wouldn't lead us here
without access.

28:45.254 --> 28:47.561
What are those?

28:51.870 --> 28:53.807
No freakin' way.

28:53.807 --> 28:56.527
Get the bow.

28:59.151 --> 29:01.958
Remember how
my dad used to train?

29:13.992 --> 29:15.645
Access granted.

29:16.586 --> 29:19.432
You'd think Felicity would
have made that a lot easier.

29:20.695 --> 29:23.095
She's obviously
trying to protect something.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.723
I'll bring up the last
files she accessed.

29:26.723 --> 29:28.125
These are structural maps

29:28.125 --> 29:30.185
of all the buildings
throughout Star City.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.318
City Hall, Central Library,

29:32.361 --> 29:33.438
old Rockets Arena...

29:33.438 --> 29:34.700
all areas outside the Glades.

29:34.743 --> 29:36.963
Yeah. Along with schematics
to build explosives

29:37.006 --> 29:39.574
and the money to fund it.

29:44.211 --> 29:48.540
This is a plan to level
all of Star City.

29:52.476 --> 29:53.789
What you got?

29:53.789 --> 29:57.004
Anatoly said in order to catch Diaz,
I couldn't worry about the cost.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.304
Felicity, you know how
I feel about this.

29:58.304 --> 29:59.464
I know, and that's not
the point.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.675
The point is that Diaz
does worry about the cost.

30:01.675 --> 30:03.176
I mean, it's basically
his whole M.O.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.461
Diaz wants to make a statement.

30:04.461 --> 30:06.513
The man carries around
a flamethrower.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.875
Subtlety isn't his strong suit.

30:07.875 --> 30:10.051
So I started wondering, what is
a statement worthy of a dragon?

30:10.095 --> 30:11.748
I ran an algorithm
cross-referencing

30:11.792 --> 30:14.688
the betab-500 and the
manufacturer's specification.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.524
Turns out that this model
is a new version,

30:17.524 --> 30:18.961
where you can attach
it to a pipe.

30:19.004 --> 30:22.616
For instance, a pipe
underground filled with gas.

30:22.660 --> 30:23.922
- Gas plant.
- Mm-hmm.

30:23.966 --> 30:25.881
- That building's totally fireproof.
- Rest of the city...

30:25.881 --> 30:28.100
- ...not so much.
- If Diaz sets off those bombs,

30:28.100 --> 30:29.703
a whole river of gas
underneath the city

30:29.703 --> 30:31.270
goes up in flames literally.

30:31.313 --> 30:33.897
Ok. A.R.G.U.S. will
continue the evac.

30:33.897 --> 30:35.203
We'll handle these bombs.

30:35.246 --> 30:36.740
Does that mean what
I think it means?

30:36.740 --> 30:38.253
Call the whole team. We're
gonna need all the help

30:38.253 --> 30:40.022
we can get on this one.

30:47.084 --> 30:48.433
I miss good old days

30:48.477 --> 30:50.131
when bomb could be turned
off by computer

30:50.174 --> 30:51.523
far away in dark warehouse.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.162
Yeah. These are not
those type of bombs,

30:53.162 --> 30:54.475
and since we're on the
topic of freaking out,

30:54.475 --> 30:56.287
the bombs are linked, which
means we can't disarm one

30:56.287 --> 30:57.506
without detonating the other.

30:57.549 --> 30:58.811
Which means
we'll have to disarm them

30:58.855 --> 31:00.117
at the exact same time.

31:00.160 --> 31:03.163
It's like the world's
worst trust fall.

31:04.694 --> 31:08.158
Ohh. I was hoping it would
look less scary in person.

31:08.158 --> 31:10.256
- Wishful thinking.
- Bogey number one is attached

31:10.256 --> 31:12.345
to the main pipeline leading
straight into star city.

31:12.389 --> 31:14.173
We got eyes on the second bomb.

31:14.217 --> 31:16.913
Guys, this timer's
started already.

31:16.913 --> 31:18.088
Mine, too.

31:19.233 --> 31:21.453
This timer was
activated manually.

31:21.496 --> 31:23.832
Diaz is still here.

31:24.690 --> 31:25.822
Dinah, meet me outside.

31:25.865 --> 31:27.315
Anatoly, Rene.

31:27.315 --> 31:29.056
We'll keep an eye
on the bomb squad.

31:29.099 --> 31:30.449
Bring in our exfil.

31:30.492 --> 31:34.278
I want to watch the fireworks
from above.

31:34.322 --> 31:37.589
Curtis, each linking device is
protected by its own crypto-key.

31:37.589 --> 31:40.979
We decrypt the passcodes, and then we
input them at the exact same time.

31:40.979 --> 31:43.360
Yeah. I'm gonna need a little
bit more time on my end.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.653
You got the easy bomb.

31:44.653 --> 31:45.785
We do not have more time.

31:45.828 --> 31:48.396
- When can we run?
- Not now.

31:51.443 --> 31:52.835
Guys, we have a problem.

31:52.879 --> 31:54.913
My little bundle of joy came
with a backup detonator.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.374
- Cell phone transmitter.
- Can you remove it?

31:57.374 --> 31:58.625
Not if we don't want
to set it off.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.953
We can't input those passcodes
until we have that master phone.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.945
Once Diaz realizes that
the timers have been stopped...

32:02.945 --> 32:07.340
He blows us up with phone call.
Festive.

32:07.384 --> 32:10.909
You go get that phone.
I got this.

32:22.225 --> 32:24.662
Got the passcode.
Ready to input it.

32:24.705 --> 32:29.101
I'm ready, too.
Digg, Rene, do you copy?

32:30.566 --> 32:31.959
Anyone?

32:58.203 --> 33:00.814
Come on. Come on, Rene.

33:19.093 --> 33:20.703
We cannot wait any longer.

33:20.747 --> 33:27.885
- They're gonna come through.
- Ok. On 3. 1, 2, 3, type.

33:33.615 --> 33:35.966
Now we run.

33:38.431 --> 33:40.519
Impressive,

33:40.519 --> 33:41.824
but it's pointless.

33:47.069 --> 33:49.223
Impossible.

34:22.255 --> 34:24.353
Breaking news out of Star City.

34:24.353 --> 34:28.149
Notorious fugitive Ricardo Diaz
is behind bars tonight,

34:28.149 --> 34:31.456
thanks to the efforts
of the unidentified Green Arrow.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.545
Earlier this evening,
the vigilante foiled

34:33.589 --> 34:36.157
an attempted bombing
at the natural gas plant,

34:36.199 --> 34:40.161
leaving many to wonder
should the anti-vigilante law

34:40.204 --> 34:42.032
be revoked.

34:43.362 --> 34:45.556
Well, just like the
good old days, huh?

34:45.601 --> 34:47.585
The Green Arrow swooping
in to save the day.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.735
We do all the work,
and he gets all the credit.

34:49.779 --> 34:51.231
About time he got some credit.

34:51.231 --> 34:52.668
The important thing is
we caught Diaz.

34:52.668 --> 34:54.801
And this is a huge
collar for the SCPD.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.976
The feds are gonna be pissed
they didn't get him first,

34:57.020 --> 34:59.894
and we are gonna charge Diaz
with every crime in the book.

34:59.894 --> 35:02.225
Guys, we caught Diaz.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.519
This is what can happen
when we all work together.

35:04.519 --> 35:05.812
I don't want to say
I told you so...

35:05.855 --> 35:07.800
- but you are, right?
- Yeah.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.191
You know what? Let's go get
a drink and celebrate.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.384
- We deserve it, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

35:16.049 --> 35:21.436
Well, Felicity, after
everything, you did it.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.438
How's it feel?

35:23.482 --> 35:28.661
Well... Diaz is
behind bars.

35:29.362 --> 35:31.577
What could be better than that?

35:32.761 --> 35:35.015
I mean, I thought
I made myself clear.

35:35.604 --> 35:36.862
I don't want your help.

35:36.862 --> 35:39.137
That's just too bad because
as your legal counsel,

35:39.137 --> 35:42.724
I am obligated to inform
you of your case status.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.935
That should be your copy
of the court's ruling.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.854
Spoiler alert... we lost.

35:47.854 --> 35:49.247
Must be difficult to win a case

35:49.290 --> 35:52.032
when you're not a real lawyer.

35:52.076 --> 35:55.688
Says here the judge is
ordering an investigation

35:55.731 --> 35:58.675
into prisoner abuse at Slabside?

35:58.675 --> 36:00.450
Turns out the government
isn't a big fan

36:00.450 --> 36:03.453
of lobotomizing their prisoners.

36:06.429 --> 36:09.850
That will help a lot
of people in here.

36:09.894 --> 36:12.462
- Ahem. Thank you.
- I don't want your thanks.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.639
I didn't do this for you.
I did this for me,

36:16.343 --> 36:19.687
and, no, I am not your Laurel.

36:19.687 --> 36:22.428
I'm not the old Laurel.
I'm me.

36:23.148 --> 36:25.210
Everyone has good
and bad inside of them,

36:25.210 --> 36:30.131
and you can't put people
in one box or the other ever.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.466
Vodka?

37:00.969 --> 37:02.840
What, because I am Russian?

37:02.884 --> 37:05.016
That is stereotype,

37:05.060 --> 37:07.976
but da, yes, vodka.
I only have a bit left.

37:08.019 --> 37:10.152
I hope they have vodka
in the Maldives,

37:10.195 --> 37:13.895
that is, if you can do
an American accent.

37:15.766 --> 37:17.861
Hello. I am Jason brown

37:17.861 --> 37:19.988
from Denver, Colorado.

37:19.988 --> 37:20.989
Heh.

37:21.768 --> 37:22.944
Spasiba.

37:23.674 --> 37:26.362
You're a strong person,
Felicity Smoak.

37:26.362 --> 37:28.930
You catch dragon.

37:31.362 --> 37:34.148
Now don't look back.

37:38.239 --> 37:39.849
Doesn't make any sense.

37:39.892 --> 37:43.592
Felicity wouldn't do
something like this.

37:43.635 --> 37:46.899
Like we said, she changed.

37:46.943 --> 37:48.249
Ok. Let's say
you're right

37:48.292 --> 37:51.904
and Felicity somehow
became overwatch of evil.

37:51.948 --> 37:53.079
Why lead us here?

37:53.123 --> 37:54.650
Maybe she had a change of heart,

37:54.650 --> 37:56.000
tried to back out last second.

37:56.043 --> 37:58.480
It'd explain why someone
would want her dead, right?

37:58.524 --> 37:59.786
Not to state the obvious,

37:59.829 --> 38:01.767
but if we start poking
around, it's gonna make

38:01.767 --> 38:02.947
us targets, too.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.515
None of us have any idea what
Felicity's intentions were

38:05.950 --> 38:08.169
or why she reached out to you.

38:08.578 --> 38:11.058
Following this lead
means taking a risk.

38:11.406 --> 38:14.667
I don't know what happened to
Felicity these past few years,

38:14.667 --> 38:19.498
but what I do know is there was a
time when all of us loved her.

38:19.976 --> 38:24.589
Isn't finding out what really
happened worth the risk?

38:25.765 --> 38:31.422
Fine. We'll start by tracking
down whoever she contacted last.

38:31.466 --> 38:35.273
Ok. Last call out
was to someone named...

38:35.273 --> 38:36.231
Blackstar.

38:36.274 --> 38:37.798
That doesn't sound
ominous at all.

38:37.841 --> 38:39.843
I swear to god, if
this gets me killed,

38:39.887 --> 38:42.846
- I'm gonna murder you.
- Noted.

38:53.648 --> 38:56.757
I liked you better
with pink hair.

38:56.757 --> 38:59.282
You don't scare me.

38:59.325 --> 39:03.578
I don't think that's true.

39:04.156 --> 39:06.359
See that camera?

39:06.359 --> 39:07.535
No red light.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.792
That means you and I
are completely alone.

39:10.792 --> 39:12.229
Hmm.

39:13.059 --> 39:17.455
You took my husband from me.

39:17.498 --> 39:21.198
I had to send my son away.

39:21.241 --> 39:25.028
You destroyed my life.

39:25.071 --> 39:28.640
What you gonna do about it?

39:37.388 --> 39:41.870
- You don't have the guts.
- No. I do.

39:41.914 --> 39:44.786
You see, that's the problem.

39:44.830 --> 39:51.228
I do have the guts because you
made me into this person.

39:53.231 --> 39:55.233
Hmm?

39:55.535 --> 39:57.755
Go ahead.

40:01.247 --> 40:05.028
Sweetheart, this is
the big boys' table.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.984
You should leave.

40:10.943 --> 40:12.031
Felicity, don't.

40:12.075 --> 40:13.685
Couldn't be without me,
could you, baby?

40:13.728 --> 40:14.947
I'm ending him, Laurel.

40:14.991 --> 40:17.364
No. You don't want to
do this, trust me.

40:17.364 --> 40:20.083
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!

40:20.126 --> 40:24.087
We need him to help Oliver.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.437
What do you mean?

40:27.692 --> 40:33.216
I made a deal
with the feds, a trade.

40:33.216 --> 40:36.055
Diaz for your husband.

40:36.099 --> 40:38.057
If Oliver agrees to assist them

40:38.101 --> 40:41.756
with their case against Diaz,

40:41.800 --> 40:44.890
he'll be a free man again.

40:53.333 --> 40:56.771
Oliver's coming home?

40:56.815 --> 40:58.730
Yeah.

41:11.569 --> 41:12.787
How did you do it?

41:12.831 --> 41:14.311
I knew the Green Arrow was good,

41:14.354 --> 41:16.095
but I didn't think
he was that good.

41:16.139 --> 41:18.010
Stanley, I'm just
glad you're ok.

41:18.054 --> 41:20.453
Ok? I'm great!
I was this close

41:20.453 --> 41:22.625
to being stuck in here
for the rest of my life.

41:22.625 --> 41:24.482
If you hadn't found
Turner's blade,

41:24.482 --> 41:27.193
it would have been
all over for me.

41:29.021 --> 41:31.284
How'd you know it was
Turner's blade?

41:31.833 --> 41:35.310
- What do you mean?
- You were in the hole, Stanley,

41:35.310 --> 41:40.119
so how'd you know
it was Turner's blade?

41:40.163 --> 41:44.297
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

41:46.560 --> 41:49.346
You gonna eat that?

41:54.929 --> 41:58.958
