WEBVTT

00:03.461 --> 00:06.338
I can't believe
you would actually say that.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.842
I would much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.053
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right?

00:13.221 --> 00:15.848
He's gotta be, like,
the toughest snack there is.

00:17.392 --> 00:20.769
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with corn nuts.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.022
They're crazy.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.568
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You gotta come see this.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.778
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.992
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.453
Oh, that is so sick.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.371
I feel violated.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.290
And not in a good way.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.083
How can people do that?

00:45.837 --> 00:48.505
Oh, you guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.521
I'm telling you, years from now,
school children will study it...

01:45.688 --> 01:48.690
...as one of the greatest
first dates of all time.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.734
It was unbelievable.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.904
We could totally be ourselves.
We didn't have to play any games.

01:54.072 --> 01:57.533
- So have you called her yet?
- Let her know I like her? Are you insane?

01:58.326 --> 01:59.576
Guys. It's gross.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.454
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.039
I'm right. Right?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.791
- Let her dangle.
- Yeah, definitely.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.042
Oh.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.752
I can't believe my parents
are pressuring me...

02:09.920 --> 02:11.839
...to find one of you people.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.716
God. Come on. Just do it.

02:14.884 --> 02:18.387
Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.307
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.232
- I got her machine.
- Her answering machine?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.776
No, interestingly enough,
her leaf blower picked up.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.740
So, um, why didn't you say anything?

02:38.908 --> 02:41.827
Oh, no, no, no. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

02:41.995 --> 02:44.580
...I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

02:46.875 --> 02:50.460
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
No, no, don't everybody look at once.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.714
- Okay, okay. What's going on?
- Okay, they're just talking.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.549
Yeah, well, does he look upset?

02:55.717 --> 02:58.260
Does he look like
he was just told to shove anything?

02:59.888 --> 03:02.639
No. No, actually, he's smiling.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.100
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.268
What? What? What?

03:06.436 --> 03:09.813
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.357
Oh.

03:12.525 --> 03:16.361
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.946
Oh.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.451
- See? Hey, Rach.
- Hey.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.286
How'd it go?

03:24.454 --> 03:28.332
You know, it was, uh...
It was actually really great.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.417
Took me to lunch
at the Russian Tea Room.

03:30.585 --> 03:34.004
I had that chicken, you know,
where you poke it and butter squirts out.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.256
Not a good day for birds.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.175
And then we took a walk to Bendel's.

03:38.343 --> 03:42.137
And I told him not to, but he got me
a little bottle of Chanel.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.725
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

03:46.893 --> 03:51.313
...to stop calling, stop sending you flowers
and to generally leave you alone, huh?

03:51.814 --> 03:55.651
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.946
Oh, it was just so nice to see him again,
you know? It was...

03:59.113 --> 04:02.491
It was comfortable and it was familiar.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.201
It was just nice.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.995
That's "nice" twice.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.331
Rachel, what's going on?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.959
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.835
Duh. Where have you been?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.714
Yeah, but it was different with him today.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.759
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy,
you know?

04:20.927 --> 04:24.680
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.266
Yes.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.978
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.066
Okay, how about the fact that
he's engaged to another woman...

04:36.234 --> 04:38.318
...who just happens to be
your ex-best friend?

04:38.486 --> 04:41.571
All right. All right, all right, all right.
I know it's stupid.

04:41.739 --> 04:45.075
I'll go see him this afternoon
and I will just put an end to it.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.910
Wow.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.455
- Wow.
- Ha, ha.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.040
Yeah.

04:52.208 --> 04:55.544
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.422
No, it wasn't.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.678
Oh. It was so nice
having this little sink here.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.394
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.274
Give me a call when you get a chance."

05:19.819 --> 05:21.320
Bye-bye.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.363
Oh, God.

05:25.116 --> 05:28.535
That's what you've been working on
for the past two hours?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.871
Hey, I've been honing.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.998
What was with the dishes?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.168
Oh, uh, I wanted her to think
I might be in a restaurant...

05:36.336 --> 05:39.463
...you know,
I might have some kind of life.

05:39.630 --> 05:42.966
Like I haven't been sitting around here
honing for the last two hours?

05:43.301 --> 05:45.552
He's doing it again.
The guy with the telescope.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.429
Oh, my God.

05:48.264 --> 05:52.934
Oh. Go away.
Stop looking in here!

05:53.102 --> 05:55.729
Great. Now he's waving back.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.815
We gotta do something
about that guy.

05:58.983 --> 06:01.318
This morning, I caught him
looking into our apartment.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.112
It creeps me out. I feel like I can't do stuff.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.240
What kind of stuff?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.870
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

06:12.038 --> 06:14.664
...but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.377
You cook naked?

06:18.544 --> 06:21.713
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

06:25.176 --> 06:27.719
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.640
What's the matter?

06:31.808 --> 06:35.060
Oh, I just...
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.188
No, it was. It was very, very good.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.942
- What about Mindy?
- Oh, way better than Mindy.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.947
No, not that.
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.492
Oh. If you want,
I'll just break it off with her.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.993
No. No, no, no.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.621
No, don't do that. Not for me.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.375
Dr. Farber,
Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.127
Thanks, Bernice.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.879
Let's go away this weekend.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.340
Oh, Barry. Come on. This is all way too...

07:05.508 --> 07:07.134
No, we can go to Aruba.

07:07.969 --> 07:11.096
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

07:11.264 --> 07:14.266
...it was, uh... It was really nice.
You would've liked it.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.645
I had a bra.

07:29.991 --> 07:30.991
Hey, Dr. Farber.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.411
All right, Miss Green,
everything looks fine.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.956
Yep, I think we're starting to see
some real progress here.

07:41.752 --> 07:44.880
- What?
- I'm 12, I'm not stupid.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.100
- Can I use your phone?
- Yeah.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.895
Uh, but for future reference,
um, that thing in your hand...

08:00.062 --> 08:02.189
...can also be used as a phone.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.569
Yes, it's working.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.281
Why isn't she calling me back?

08:11.866 --> 08:13.366
Maybe she never got your message.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.995
You know, you could call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

08:17.163 --> 08:19.998
...that means she probably
didn't get her messages yet.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.960
- You don't think that makes me seem...?
- Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

08:24.921 --> 08:27.422
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.010
- How many beeps?
- She answered.

08:34.889 --> 08:38.183
You see, this is where you'd use
that "hello" word we talked about.

08:39.059 --> 08:41.186
I'm not going to.
She obviously got my message...

08:41.354 --> 08:45.232
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.985
God, I miss just being needy.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.404
Hey.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.198
So how'd he take it?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.784
Pretty well, actually.

08:57.286 --> 09:01.831
Uh, Rach. How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

09:03.167 --> 09:04.668
Oh, do I?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.548
We ended up having sex in his chair.

09:10.424 --> 09:12.050
You had sex in his chair?

09:16.889 --> 09:19.558
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

09:20.851 --> 09:22.936
You had what?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.814
Sex in his chair.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.609
What?

09:29.777 --> 09:31.194
What were you thinking?

09:31.362 --> 09:34.489
I don't know.
I mean, we still care about each other.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.742
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.953
No. No, no.

09:40.621 --> 09:42.706
It's nothing like me and Carol.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.918
Please. If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

09:47.086 --> 09:49.379
...right here, right now,"
what would you say?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.967
If it helps I could slide over.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.972
It's a totally different situation.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.559
It's apples and oranges.
It's orthodontists and lesbians...

10:02.727 --> 10:04.269
I gotta go.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.814
- Where are you going?
- I just have to go, all right?

10:07.982 --> 10:11.359
Do I need a reason, huh?
I have things to do with my life.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.695
I have a jam-packed schedule.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.949
And I am late for keeping up with it,
okay?

10:20.578 --> 10:22.912
Hello? Hello?

10:28.085 --> 10:29.794
Hello?

10:30.004 --> 10:33.006
Huh. Mindy.

10:33.215 --> 10:36.426
Hi. Hey, how are you?

10:36.594 --> 10:40.597
Yes, yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.141
Really, oh, God...

10:43.643 --> 10:45.018
Okay.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.645
Okay, I'm working tomorrow...

10:46.812 --> 10:50.148
...but if you want,
you can come by if you'd like.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.858
Okay.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.487
Great.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.863
All right.

10:57.031 --> 10:59.574
So I'll see you tomorrow.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.951
Okay. Bye.

11:03.371 --> 11:05.705
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.292
So how's Mindy?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.754
Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.799
Oh, she sounded really weird.
I gotta call Barry.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.430
Hi, it's me. I just... Ha! Mindy.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.600
Mindy. Hi.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.352
No, I figured that's where you'd be.

11:43.619 --> 11:46.371
Hell is filled with people like you.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.209
He's back. The peeper's back.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.129
- Get down.
- Get down?

11:54.505 --> 11:55.880
And boogie.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.344
Thanks, but I gotta go to work
and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.221
Relax. She may not even know.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.850
Please, I haven't heard from her
in seven months, and now she calls me.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.102
I mean, what else is it about?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.312
She was my best friend, you guys.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.231
We went to camp together...

12:13.399 --> 12:16.651
...she taught me how to kiss...
- Yeah?

12:18.195 --> 12:21.197
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.284
- Ugh, I feel so...
- Naughty.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.788
- I'll see you guys later.
- I'll walk out with you.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.458
When she taught you to kiss,
you were at camp...

12:31.625 --> 12:34.753
...and were you wearing
any kind of little uniform or...?

12:36.630 --> 12:38.715
That's fine, yeah.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.343
Okay, I'm gonna go the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

12:42.511 --> 12:44.471
- Why don't you just take it with you?
- Hey.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.682
We haven't been on a second date.
She needs to hear me pee?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.517
Why don't you just call her?

12:49.685 --> 12:52.896
I can't call her. I left a message.
I have some pride.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.898
- Do you?
- No.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.947
Danielle, hi.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.158
Hi, it's Chandler.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.619
I'm fine. Ahem.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.370
Uh, listen...

13:09.580 --> 13:13.249
I don't know if you tried to call me
because, uh, idiot that I am...

13:13.417 --> 13:16.044
...I accidentally shut off my phone.

13:16.754 --> 13:22.425
Ahem. Oh, okay. That's fine.
That's great. Okay.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.762
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.725
She's on the other line,
gonna call me back.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.228
- Don't you have to pee?
- That's why I'm dancing.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.819
- Mindy.
- Hey, you.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.987
Hey, you.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.159
So, what's up?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.579
Um, we should really be sitting for this.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.039
Hmm.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.124
Sure we should.

14:03.676 --> 14:07.303
- So...
- Now, I know things have been weird lately.

14:07.471 --> 14:10.682
But you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie Schaefer...

14:10.850 --> 14:12.350
...who I don't talk to anymore...

14:12.518 --> 14:15.103
...because she's bitter
that she lost the weight...

14:15.271 --> 14:17.772
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

14:19.942 --> 14:23.236
Okay, I'm gonna just ask you this once,
and I want a straight answer.

14:23.821 --> 14:24.946
Okay.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.825
Will you be my maid of honor?

14:32.913 --> 14:34.873
- Of course!
- Oh, that's so great!

14:35.749 --> 14:36.875
It is! It is!

14:38.752 --> 14:40.837
- Is that all you wanted to ask?
- That's all.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.551
What? What?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.219
That's not all.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.557
- Oh, sure it is.
- Oh, no, it isn't. No.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.227
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

14:57.771 --> 14:59.772
What would make you think that?

14:59.940 --> 15:02.984
Well, ever since we announced
the engagement, he's acted weird.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.821
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.700
Really?

15:12.244 --> 15:14.621
Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better...

15:14.788 --> 15:18.333
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he went through a weird thing too.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.835
Oh, God.
You see, that's what I was afraid of.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.923
- What? What's what you were afraid of?
- Okay, okay.

15:25.090 --> 15:29.928
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I...

15:30.095 --> 15:33.890
...kind of had a little thing on the side.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.060
- What?
- I know, I know.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.479
When he proposed to me,
everyone said, "Don't do it.

15:39.730 --> 15:43.524
He's gonna do to you what he did
to Rachel." And now I feel so stupid.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.443
Ha, ha.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.821
Hmm. Oh, Mindy.

15:48.989 --> 15:50.490
Oh, you are so stupid.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.119
Oh, we are both so stupid.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.663
What do you mean?

15:59.166 --> 16:01.709
- Smell familiar?
- Oh, no.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.211
Mm-hm.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.380
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.341
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.843
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.401
Oh, my.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.989
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

16:31.156 --> 16:32.532
Ring, damn it, ring.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.242
Thanks.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.788
You know our phone's not working?

16:38.956 --> 16:40.456
What?

16:41.375 --> 16:44.419
I tried to call you from the coffee shop.
There was no answer.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.212
I turned it off.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.965
Mother of God, I turned it off.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.633
Just like you told her you did.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.220
Just pointing out the irony.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.433
So listen, I went across the street
and talked to the doorman.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.394
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

17:03.814 --> 17:05.481
Can I use your phone?

17:09.236 --> 17:11.904
Yeah, the number
for a Sidney Marks, please.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.823
"Heating device."

17:14.992 --> 17:16.200
Radiator.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.993
Five letters.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.829
"Rdtor."

17:24.376 --> 17:26.627
Yeah, is Sidney there?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.880
Oh, this is?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.966
- Sidney's a woman.
- So she's a woman, so what?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.469
Yeah, yeah, so what?

17:34.636 --> 17:36.345
Look, I live across the street...

17:36.513 --> 17:38.806
...and I know all about you
and your telescope.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.933
And I don't appreciate it, okay?

17:41.101 --> 17:43.895
Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.190
Look, if I wanna walk around my apartment
in my underwear...

17:47.357 --> 17:50.276
...I shouldn't have to feel like...
Thank you.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.073
That's not really the point.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.866
The point is, that...

17:57.034 --> 17:59.911
- Mostly free-weights, but occasionally...
- Joey.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.665
Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.753
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.507
The green dress? Really?

18:12.674 --> 18:15.343
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman
that day.

18:15.719 --> 18:18.054
Heh. No.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.310
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.270
- You got a second?
- Sure, sure.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.897
Come on...

18:28.065 --> 18:29.357
...in.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.817
Hello, sweetheart.

18:31.693 --> 18:36.405
- What you guys doing here?
- Uh, we are here to break up with you.

18:37.699 --> 18:38.908
Both of you?

18:39.243 --> 18:43.329
We think you're a horrible human being,
and bad things should happen to you.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.126
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

18:48.377 --> 18:50.753
I'm an idiot. I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

18:50.921 --> 18:54.006
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.761
Uh, which one of us
are you talking to there, Bar?

18:59.346 --> 19:00.555
Um...

19:01.849 --> 19:02.932
Mindy.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.810
Mindy, of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.479
Even when we were having sex
in that chair?

19:08.897 --> 19:12.358
I swear, look, whatever I was doing,
I was always thinking of you.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.402
Oh, please.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.947
During that second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.198
You did it twice?

19:19.533 --> 19:22.827
Well, the first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.704
Oh, right.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.831
Honey, baby, sweetheart, look...

19:26.999 --> 19:28.916
Just give me another chance, okay?

19:29.084 --> 19:32.128
We'll start all over again.
We'll go back to Aruba.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.298
What do you say?

19:35.465 --> 19:38.426
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.220
Jason Castalano's
choking on his retainer.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.265
Oh, God. Uh, I'll be right there, Bernice.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.726
Look, please,
please don't go anywhere, okay?

19:46.894 --> 19:50.062
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.232
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.153
See how he was sweating
when he walked out of here?

19:57.321 --> 19:59.697
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

19:59.865 --> 20:03.576
...and take a couple of punches.
Because I'm telling you, this feels great.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.622
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.917
What are you talking about?

20:11.084 --> 20:13.878
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.214
He is Satan in a smock.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.883
Look, I know he's not perfect.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.972
But the truth is,
at the end of the day...

20:25.140 --> 20:27.600
...I still really wanna be...

20:27.768 --> 20:31.395
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

20:31.563 --> 20:33.689
...D.D.S.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.858
Oh, God.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.737
I hope you can find some way
to be happy for me.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.365
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.702
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.503
You okay?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.296
Yeah.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.590
Really?

21:00.175 --> 21:01.592
Yeah.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.512
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

21:04.680 --> 21:07.640
...I have wondered
whether I made the right choice.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.059
Oh. And now I know.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.853
I'm so glad.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.776
Big day.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.621
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.833
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat...

21:34.001 --> 21:35.876
Did you know he's gay?

21:38.964 --> 21:43.092
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

21:44.303 --> 21:47.054
- Chandler?
- Danielle, hi.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.765
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.142
Hi.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.728
- What are you doing here?
- I've been calling you...

21:53.895 --> 21:55.938
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.442
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

21:59.609 --> 22:02.611
So I thought I'd just come down here
and make sure you were okay.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.406
Oh, uh, I'm okay.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.117
Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

22:08.618 --> 22:11.620
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

22:11.788 --> 22:12.955
- You know.
- Ha, ha.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.498
- You got it.
- Okay.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.584
- Bye, everybody.
- Bye.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.046
Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.006
Second date.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.924
I don't know.

22:24.092 --> 22:25.301
You don't know?

22:25.469 --> 22:29.221
Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
about her coming all the way here...

22:29.389 --> 22:32.808
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?
