00:21.855 --> 00:24.107
A very long time ago...

00:24.524 --> 00:29.655
...there lived a beautiful princess,
in a mystical land known as...

00:30.322 --> 00:31.573
...India.

00:47.923 --> 00:51.468
She was married to the
handsome Prince Rama...

00:51.718 --> 00:55.013
...who had been banished
to the enchanted forest...

00:55.263 --> 00:59.226
...by his jealous stepmother,
Queen Kaikeyi.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.152
One day...

01:09.403 --> 01:12.614
...Princess Sita saw a wounded deer
in the woods...

01:12.864 --> 01:15.909
...and she begged Rama
to go and help it.

01:17.619 --> 01:21.289
Rama drew a circle in the ground
and said to her:

01:21.707 --> 01:23.667
''This is a magic circle.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.503
So long as you stay inside it...

01:26.753 --> 01:29.047
...no harm can come to you. ''

01:33.385 --> 01:36.430
That night,
the princess heard a horrible cry.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.849
Help me.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.185
Thinking it was her beloved Rama
in danger...

01:42.436 --> 01:46.231
...the princess ran from the circle
to answer the cry.

01:54.740 --> 01:58.326
She soon came across
an old beggar man.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.788
Although she had no money
to give him...

02:02.038 --> 02:04.666
...she could not refuse his plea.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.169
As soon as he had the bracelet...

02:09.295 --> 02:12.716
...he transformed into the
1 0-headed demon, Ravana.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.635
He grabs her and takes her
to his palace...

02:15.886 --> 02:17.971
...to make her his bride.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.225
Did you ever know
a real prince, Maya?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.770
Laki's father.

02:25.061 --> 02:28.023
- I thought he was in the army.
- He was.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.484
And he was my prince.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.069
And I, his princess.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.906
But I mean real princes
and princesses.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.492
All women are princesses.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.160
It is our right.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.787
I shall miss it here.

03:24.204 --> 03:28.208
India is the only place on earth
that stirs the imagination.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.628
I wish we could stay here forever.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.677
I know, sweetheart.
But now that England's at war...

03:40.387 --> 03:43.682
...I must go too.
You understand, don't you?

03:44.099 --> 03:46.268
But why must I go to America?

03:46.518 --> 03:47.978
Because it's safer.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.774
And you'll be going to the school
your mother went to at your age...

03:53.066 --> 03:55.568
- ...in a city called?
- New York.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.492
Papa?

04:02.867 --> 04:06.204
Maya told me that all girls
are princesses.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.374
- Maya is a very wise woman.
- Then it's true?

04:09.791 --> 04:13.753
You can be anything you want to be,
as long as you believe.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.257
- What do you believe?
- I believe that you are...

04:17.757 --> 04:21.386
...and always will be,
my little princess.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.262
I gave this to your mother
on our wedding day.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.514
I want you to have it.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.227
She was so beautiful.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.940
What did you love most about her?

05:17.400 --> 05:18.943
Tough question.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.867
I loved the way her eyes lit up
when she laughed.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.619
Just like yours do.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.999
I loved the sound of her voice when
she sang me the Indian folksong.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.837
But I think,
more than anything else...

05:38.171 --> 05:40.590
...I loved dancing with her!

06:54.163 --> 06:55.415
Hello!

06:56.207 --> 06:57.959
You must be Captain Crewe.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.631
My sister will be down presently.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.551
We were just preparing
the young lady's room.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.720
Your things arrived this morning.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.846
Thank you...?

07:10.763 --> 07:13.266
Heavens, Amelia.
Amelia Minchin.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.102
Captain Crewe.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.326
How delightful to meet you!

07:33.161 --> 07:35.371
And this must be little Sara.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.166
My, what a beautiful child.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.253
- I was telling the Captain--
- Thank you, that'll be all.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.629
Won't you follow me?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.509
Classes begin promptly at 8:00.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.679
We cover all subjects:
literature, math, science...

07:51.929 --> 07:54.140
...and of course, French and Latin.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.225
Oh, Sara speaks fluent--

07:56.434 --> 07:59.479
Luncheon is served at 1 :30.
Then we take our daily walk...

07:59.729 --> 08:02.940
...unless the weather is
extremely inclement.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.943
At 4:00, the girls attend
etiquette classes...

08:06.152 --> 08:09.947
...where they're trained in
the formal graces of society.

08:10.948 --> 08:15.536
Study hall is between 4:30 and 6:30,
followed by a light supper.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.873
Before bedtime,
we read from one of the classics...

08:19.123 --> 08:22.293
...something the children
look forward to with anticipation.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.963
Sunday is a day of rest.
Students may write to their parents.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.801
And of course, we attend church.
Have you any questions?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.188
Come along, dear.

08:58.913 --> 08:59.914
Girls.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.750
Say hello
to our new arrival...

09:03.000 --> 09:04.293
...Miss Sara Crewe.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.420
Hello, Sara.

09:06.879 --> 09:10.174
You must tell them about
your exciting life in India.

09:10.424 --> 09:14.262
No doubt she'll be our most
popular student in no time.

09:14.470 --> 09:18.099
There are certain rules
that should be made clear.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.101
First is the Order Rule...

09:20.351 --> 09:23.980
...which requires the girls keep
their rooms spotless.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.093
These rules are strictly enforced.

09:54.343 --> 09:58.139
But I assure you, the results
are well worth the effort.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.434
Our reputation for sending
the most poised...

10:01.684 --> 10:04.604
...and charming young ladies
into society...

10:05.313 --> 10:06.856
...is one of the highest.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.316
I've no doubt.

10:09.692 --> 10:14.739
Also, I'm afraid jewelry
and such finery are not allowed.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.950
What if I wear it in my room,
during my free time?

10:19.618 --> 10:21.954
If you absolutely insist.

10:24.832 --> 10:25.750
I do.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.295
She'll get in trouble.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.146
This is splendid.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.106
It's our largest suite.

10:50.524 --> 10:53.235
Thank you for all the care
you've taken.

10:53.527 --> 10:56.197
I want Sara to feel at home
while I'm away.

10:57.073 --> 11:00.618
- No expense shall be spared.
- Of course not.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.620
I'll let you say goodbye.

11:02.870 --> 11:06.040
You don't have much time
before your boat leaves.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.432
We'll write to each other
every day.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.691
How do you like your room?

11:32.942 --> 11:38.072
I made sure it was the best,
with corner windows and a fireplace.

11:38.697 --> 11:42.034
And with all your toys
and clothes moved in...

11:42.451 --> 11:44.578
...it's as if you were really...

11:47.832 --> 11:49.834
I think I saw something...

11:50.459 --> 11:52.461
...on that chair over there.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.219
She came all the way from France
to be with you.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.139
Her name is Emily.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.399
Dolls make the very
best friends.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.779
Just because they can't speak
doesn't mean they don't listen.

12:19.321 --> 12:23.742
Did you know, when we leave them alone
in our room, they come to life?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.411
- They do?
- Yes.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.956
Before we walk in, they quickly
return to their places.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.294
Why don't they come to life
in front of us?

12:33.544 --> 12:35.421
Because it's magic.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.049
Magic has to be believed.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.927
That's the only way it's real.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.683
Whenever you're afraid,
or miss me terribly...

12:47.933 --> 12:49.685
...just tell Emily.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.231
She'll get the message to me,
wherever I am.

12:55.190 --> 12:58.152
And I'll send one back right away...

12:58.360 --> 13:00.529
...so when you hug her...

13:02.072 --> 13:04.450
...you'll be getting a hug from me.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.336
It's all right, Papa.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.298
I'm going to be fine.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.642
What are you doing?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.187
Memorizing me by heart?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.609
I already know you by heart.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.590
Goodbye princess.

14:32.037 --> 14:36.792
What was that noise last night?
Somebody was crying for hours.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.546
That's nothing.
You should hear Josephine snore.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.173
I do not!

14:43.423 --> 14:45.467
Who was it? The new girl?

14:45.676 --> 14:50.013
She hasn't come out of her room.
Did you see all her toys?

14:50.264 --> 14:51.849
I want your hair ribbon.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.394
Her father grows crackers.
They're very rich.

14:55.602 --> 14:58.605
They must be.
Everyone I know eats crackers.

14:58.814 --> 15:03.402
Her father's British. I hear he's
best friends with the king and queen.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.737
I hear he was thrown out of India...

15:05.946 --> 15:10.075
...because people died
from eating his poisoned crackers.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.952
Poisoned crackers?

15:12.160 --> 15:14.997
My aunt died from eating poisoned
string beans.

15:15.205 --> 15:19.209
- Who cares about her?
- Yeah, who cares?

15:23.171 --> 15:27.426
But before we catch them, they return
to their places, quick as lightning.

15:28.343 --> 15:30.095
Gosh, she's fast.

15:42.858 --> 15:43.775
Mama.

15:45.861 --> 15:46.987
Sara?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.157
We don't delay breakfast
for one student.

15:50.407 --> 15:51.783
I'm sorry, but I--

15:51.992 --> 15:55.287
Remember, you're not the only
child here.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.628
Yes, good morning.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.423
You remember our newest pupil
from our visit yesterday.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.550
This is Monsieur Dufarge.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.053
You begin French lessons today.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.096
Do I have to?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.307
You most certainly do.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.477
Apologize to Monsieur
for your rudeness.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.438
- But I didn't mean to be rude.
- Now!

16:37.788 --> 16:42.918
This child doesn't need to learn French.
She practically is French!

16:43.126 --> 16:44.503
She learned from her father.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.963
I understood what she said.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.341
I'm sorry. We tried to tell you.

16:49.549 --> 16:52.094
She can tutor the younger children...

16:52.344 --> 16:56.765
...and help you
with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.394
Are those sausages I smell?

17:14.782 --> 17:16.159
Thank you.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.246
There's no talking at the table.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.748
Doesn't seem natural.

17:24.792 --> 17:26.545
I won't say it again.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.431
Seven times five is 35.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.600
Seven times six is 42.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.561
Seven times seven is 49.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.480
Seven times eight is...

17:45.772 --> 17:47.149
...58.

17:48.316 --> 17:50.735
No, wait. 54?

17:53.321 --> 17:54.197
55?

17:54.447 --> 17:57.200
Or 72? Or 93? Or 1 2?

17:57.909 --> 17:59.786
I'm sorry, Miss Minchin.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.747
I studied for hours last night.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.000
I find that hard to believe.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.586
I imagine your father will as well.

18:07.919 --> 18:10.005
Please don't tell him.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.299
I promise I'll do better.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.217
Please.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.969
Lavinia, you may continue.

18:16.928 --> 18:19.598
Seven times eight is 56.

18:20.223 --> 18:21.850
Seven times nine...

18:22.100 --> 18:24.102
...is 63.

18:33.945 --> 18:35.280
Dear Papa:

18:35.614 --> 18:37.240
I miss you already.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.242
Things are fine.

18:39.492 --> 18:43.538
Except I never imagined there
would be so many rules at school.

18:43.788 --> 18:46.166
I guess they're there for a purpose...

18:46.416 --> 18:48.627
...and I'm trying hard to obey them.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.880
But I get the feeling
I'm doing something wrong.

19:09.397 --> 19:10.899
Goodbye, Father.

19:12.984 --> 19:14.069
Bye, son.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.960
I hope when you read this...

19:31.211 --> 19:35.090
...it kindles your heart and puts
a smile on your face.

19:35.340 --> 19:39.844
I'm so proud of you.
I think about you every moment.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.180
And I love you forever.

19:42.847 --> 19:44.516
Your Sara.

19:57.278 --> 19:59.698
Lottie, you mustn't get so excited.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.533
Lottie? Precious?

20:01.783 --> 20:05.870
Please, Lottie dear!
Please stop screaming!

20:06.121 --> 20:10.125
How about a cookie?
Would you like that?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.210
I'll get a cookie.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.721
It's hard to study with you
carrying on like this.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.098
I want my mama!

20:25.473 --> 20:26.683
You'll see her soon.

20:26.891 --> 20:31.604
I won't. She's dead,
and I won't ever see her again!

20:31.938 --> 20:34.107
I don't have a mother either.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.571
You don't?

20:41.072 --> 20:42.323
Where is she?

20:42.657 --> 20:45.452
In heaven with my baby sister.

20:46.369 --> 20:48.329
That doesn't mean
I can't talk to her.

20:48.538 --> 20:52.167
I tell her everything,
and I know she hears me.

20:52.417 --> 20:53.835
How?

20:54.794 --> 20:56.754
Because that's what angels do.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.924
- Your mama's an angel?
- Of course.

21:00.216 --> 21:04.095
And so is yours.
With beautiful wings of silk...

21:04.387 --> 21:06.389
...and a crown of rosebuds.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.350
And they all live together
in a castle.

21:09.559 --> 21:11.728
Do you know what it's made of?

21:12.061 --> 21:13.313
Sunflowers...

21:13.563 --> 21:18.151
...hundreds of them, so bright
they shine like gold.

21:18.818 --> 21:21.446
When the angels
want to go someplace...

21:21.654 --> 21:24.240
...they just whistle, like this.

21:31.122 --> 21:35.210
And a cloud floats to the castle
and picks them up.

21:35.418 --> 21:37.795
As the angels fly through the sky...

21:38.755 --> 21:41.341
...riding the cloud
like a magic carpet...

21:41.758 --> 21:44.552
...under the moon
and through the stars...

21:48.848 --> 21:51.517
...until they're hovering
above us.

21:54.354 --> 21:58.107
That's how they can look down
and see if we're all right.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.862
And sometimes they even
send messages to us.

22:05.865 --> 22:10.954
You can't hear them if you're
kicking and screaming as you were.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.918
But they always try again,
in case we've missed it.

22:20.004 --> 22:21.047
Hey, wait!

22:22.882 --> 22:25.677
That's Becky.
She's not allowed to talk to us.

22:25.885 --> 22:27.095
Why not?

22:27.345 --> 22:30.682
She's a servant girl,
and she has dark skin.

22:31.307 --> 22:32.475
So?

22:32.725 --> 22:35.853
Well, doesn't that mean something?

23:20.773 --> 23:22.108
I'm sorry, I--

23:22.316 --> 23:24.569
Is there anything
I can do for you, miss?

23:24.819 --> 23:27.739
I just came up here
to change my shoes.

23:28.614 --> 23:30.575
No, there's nothing.

23:30.783 --> 23:34.954
Begging your pardon, but we'll
both be in trouble if you stay.

23:40.668 --> 23:42.879
All right, girls, pair up.

23:45.047 --> 23:46.757
Pair up.

24:38.517 --> 24:41.562
''Sir Edward saw the sorrow
in his daughter's eyes...

24:41.812 --> 24:45.024
...but he knew
that family honor must prevail.

24:45.274 --> 24:47.735
Nobility was not to be trifled with.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.655
'I beg of you, Charlotte,' he said.

24:50.863 --> 24:53.532
'Marry Sir John in the spring,
as he has asked.' ''

24:53.741 --> 24:55.368
Thank you, Lavinia.

24:55.618 --> 24:57.787
Sara, you may take your turn.

25:09.465 --> 25:13.094
''Charlotte said to her father,
'Father, you are right.

25:13.302 --> 25:16.847
I must put away my foolish fancies
and childhood wishes.' ''

25:27.400 --> 25:29.068
But I simply won't do it.

25:29.568 --> 25:30.778
I'm sorry, Father.

25:31.028 --> 25:32.822
When I marry, it'll be for love.

25:33.239 --> 25:36.492
And with that,
Charlotte ran from the house.

25:36.742 --> 25:39.578
Waiting outside was
the handsome stable boy, Pierre...

25:39.829 --> 25:41.539
...whom Charlotte secretly adored.

25:41.998 --> 25:46.794
Together they escaped to the coast
and quickly set sail for Tahiti.

25:47.044 --> 25:51.799
When they were halfway there,
their ship was attacked by pirates!

25:52.258 --> 25:54.301
Rather than be eaten alive...

25:54.552 --> 25:57.388
...they threw
themselves into the sea.

25:57.596 --> 25:59.223
As they began to drown...

25:59.432 --> 26:03.519
...they held each other close,
and swore undying love.

26:05.354 --> 26:09.567
Then, when all seemed lost,
a group of mermaids appeared--

26:09.775 --> 26:10.943
Stop!

26:16.031 --> 26:17.408
What are you doing?

26:17.908 --> 26:22.621
I couldn't bear to see her marry him,
so I imagined another ending.

26:22.830 --> 26:23.956
lmagined it?

26:25.374 --> 26:27.585
Don't you ever do that, miss?

26:27.960 --> 26:31.130
Believe in something,
just to make it seem real?

26:34.049 --> 26:36.927
That's easy for a child
who has everything.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.182
There will be no more make-believe
at this school...

26:41.432 --> 26:43.309
...during reading
or any other time.

26:43.768 --> 26:46.645
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Miss Minchin.

26:47.062 --> 26:48.981
All of you, go to your bed.

26:53.986 --> 26:56.822
I never heard a story like that
in my life.

26:57.072 --> 27:00.784
I bet you know lots of them,
don't you, Sara?

27:01.535 --> 27:03.996
I want silence up there!

27:05.331 --> 27:09.001
We have to do something about this
communication rule.

27:10.044 --> 27:12.296
After Minchin goes to bed...

27:12.546 --> 27:16.509
...we'll sneak into your room, and you
can show us a real story.

27:16.759 --> 27:18.302
How about it, Sara?

27:18.552 --> 27:20.679
Only if it's just you three.

27:43.619 --> 27:45.246
Come on, come on.

28:09.270 --> 28:13.274
The evil Ravana locked the princess
up in his tower.

28:13.524 --> 28:15.693
There she stayed for many weeks...

28:15.901 --> 28:18.362
...just staring out her window...

28:18.612 --> 28:21.073
...missing her Prince Rama terribly.

28:39.925 --> 28:41.093
Perfect.

28:42.094 --> 28:44.179
You look just like Emily.

28:45.639 --> 28:49.977
My father hates dolls.
And he hates coming here.

28:50.310 --> 28:52.271
Says he doesn't belong.

28:52.521 --> 28:54.606
Then why does he send you?

28:54.940 --> 28:57.484
Because he wants me to belong.

29:27.681 --> 29:32.770
My little girl. She spoke French!
She really spoke French.

29:35.314 --> 29:38.025
Your mother and I
are very proud of you.

29:45.991 --> 29:48.786
I caught you, Nellie!

30:14.102 --> 30:15.479
Papa!

31:05.153 --> 31:07.322
Randolph...John!

31:11.493 --> 31:14.037
Rama approached the thorny palace...

31:14.288 --> 31:16.957
...unaware that Ravana
was waiting for him.

31:28.719 --> 31:31.013
That's it!
I can't take it anymore!

31:31.221 --> 31:33.348
I don't care what you say
about Sara's stories.

31:33.557 --> 31:37.185
They have to be more fun than
watching your hair being combed!

31:38.437 --> 31:42.190
If anyone else feels the same way,
she should leave too.

31:57.456 --> 31:59.833
But Ravana was not through yet.

32:00.375 --> 32:04.880
He took a bow that could
hold, not one, but 1 0 arrows...

32:05.255 --> 32:07.174
...each filled with poison.

32:07.424 --> 32:09.593
The arrows sped through the air...

32:09.885 --> 32:11.678
...heading straight for Rama.

32:12.429 --> 32:14.598
The arrows hit the ground...

32:14.848 --> 32:19.978
...and released their poison,
giant clouds of thick, yello w smoke.

33:26.545 --> 33:29.589
- I want a big piece!
- Hush up, Lottie.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.926
''Princess'' Sara will give
everyone a fair share.

33:33.593 --> 33:34.928
Right, Princess?

33:35.595 --> 33:37.848
I told her that's what you were.

33:38.098 --> 33:41.268
Well, not just me.
All girls are princesses.

33:41.476 --> 33:44.938
Even snotty, two-faced bullies
like you, Lavinia.

33:57.659 --> 34:00.328
Here, Lavinia,
you get a big piece.

34:15.010 --> 34:16.761
Yes, may I help you?

34:17.012 --> 34:18.638
I'm Mr. Barrow.

34:19.723 --> 34:21.975
Captain Crewe's solicitor.

34:22.266 --> 34:24.561
Oh, yes, do come in.

34:28.315 --> 34:32.569
- We're celebrating Sara's birthday.
- May I speak to you in private?

34:32.860 --> 34:35.530
Yes, of course.
Right this way.

35:09.189 --> 35:13.860
May I just say that Sara is quite
the favorite around here.

35:14.110 --> 35:17.947
We went to great lengths to make
this a special day for her.

35:31.294 --> 35:35.465
I'm afraid your check to us this month
will be rather large.

35:35.715 --> 35:38.885
There will be no check,
Miss Minchin.

35:39.636 --> 35:41.096
Excuse me?

36:32.480 --> 36:37.026
The party is over! Everyone
go to their rooms, this instant!

36:37.277 --> 36:38.236
But we--

36:38.486 --> 36:40.488
Sara, you will stay behind.

36:41.239 --> 36:43.199
I have something to tell you.

36:44.075 --> 36:45.368
Move!

36:52.667 --> 36:56.504
Amelia, go to Sara's room
and find a simple black dress.

36:56.713 --> 36:59.132
If nothing is suitable, borrow one.

36:59.382 --> 37:01.593
- But, sister--
- Do as I say.

37:11.477 --> 37:14.856
Why would I need a black dress,
Miss Minchin?

37:30.288 --> 37:33.166
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Sara.

37:35.293 --> 37:36.919
Your father has...

37:39.380 --> 37:40.840
Your father--

37:42.967 --> 37:46.471
It's been discovered that
your father has died.

37:47.305 --> 37:50.016
He was killed in battle
several weeks ago.

37:52.185 --> 37:53.353
I'm sorry.

37:54.312 --> 37:59.233
That's the situation, and
there's nothing we can do to change it.

38:00.985 --> 38:05.907
The British government has seized
control of his company and assets...

38:06.324 --> 38:09.577
...leaving you penniless,
without any money.

38:09.869 --> 38:14.165
Since you've no relations,
this puts me in a terrible position.

38:16.667 --> 38:18.336
What are you staring at?

38:19.587 --> 38:21.923
Don't you understand
what I'm saying?

38:22.507 --> 38:24.926
You are alone in the world...

38:27.178 --> 38:29.639
...unless I decide to keep you here...

38:29.889 --> 38:31.349
...out of charity.

38:43.194 --> 38:47.281
Because of the expenses you've
incurred, all you own is mine...

38:47.532 --> 38:50.326
...your clothes, your toys, everything.

38:50.576 --> 38:54.956
It'll hardly make up for
the financial losses I've suffered.

38:55.206 --> 38:58.292
From now on, you must earn
your room and board.

38:58.501 --> 39:01.921
You'll move to the attic
and work as a servant.

39:03.756 --> 39:06.050
If you fail to meet our standards...

39:06.300 --> 39:09.428
...or if you don 't obey,
you'll be thrown out.

39:09.679 --> 39:14.725
And the streets of this city
are not kind to homeless beggars.

39:19.814 --> 39:23.276
Report to Mabel in the kitchen
promptly at 5 a.m.

39:26.946 --> 39:29.407
You could be arrested
for taking this.

39:30.992 --> 39:33.327
You're lucky I let you keep
that doll.

39:34.036 --> 39:35.496
You may have the book.

39:35.746 --> 39:37.874
But another incident like this...

39:38.082 --> 39:40.376
...and I will call the authorities.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.006
I expect you to remember,
Sara Crewe...

39:45.381 --> 39:47.758
...you're not a princess any longer.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.333
Papa.

41:16.138 --> 41:18.015
Papa, please.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.562
Sara, what happened?

42:06.105 --> 42:10.025
You're to serve the girls
without conversation, understand?

42:10.693 --> 42:14.113
Sara will be working here
as a servant from now on.

42:14.363 --> 42:18.117
There will be no communication.
Is that clear?

42:18.450 --> 42:20.619
Yes, Miss Minchin.

42:36.302 --> 42:38.888
Seven times five is 35.

42:42.057 --> 42:43.767
Seven times six is 42.

43:26.685 --> 43:27.853
Let go!

44:08.727 --> 44:10.020
Great God!

44:10.270 --> 44:11.438
It can't be!

44:11.897 --> 44:13.482
It's my son, John!

44:13.732 --> 44:15.025
Dear God, no.

44:15.275 --> 44:16.360
Not John.

44:16.610 --> 44:18.529
It's John, Ram Dass!

44:19.154 --> 44:20.906
It's John. Help me.

44:21.323 --> 44:23.575
- Come inside.
- Help.

44:34.086 --> 44:36.588
I thought you'd be sleeping.

44:39.758 --> 44:43.095
I never got a chance
to give you your birthday present.

44:45.431 --> 44:47.766
It's a picture of where you
used to live.

44:48.100 --> 44:51.770
See the blue threads?
That's the river.

44:52.771 --> 44:55.732
These are the mountains
you always talk about.

44:56.483 --> 44:58.318
Thank you, Becky.

44:59.236 --> 45:00.571
It's beautiful.

45:05.659 --> 45:07.870
Why don't you tell stories anymore?

45:08.704 --> 45:12.624
They're just make-believe.
They don't mean anything.

45:13.375 --> 45:15.711
They've always meant something to me.

45:16.378 --> 45:20.674
Some days I thought I'd die, until
I heard you talk about the magic.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.802
There is no magic, Becky.

45:45.324 --> 45:46.825
Papa...

45:48.368 --> 45:50.287
...can you hear me?

45:51.914 --> 45:53.790
I'm so scared.

46:33.497 --> 46:35.707
Are you still a princess?

46:36.708 --> 46:40.462
You better get back in line
or we'll both be in trouble.

46:40.712 --> 46:41.588
Are you?

46:45.384 --> 46:46.885
Girls, get in line.

47:13.078 --> 47:14.287
Don't touch that!

47:14.579 --> 47:16.289
It's for Mr. Randolph.

47:16.540 --> 47:20.627
The poor man. His son is
missing in action in Europe.

47:20.877 --> 47:23.922
You mean John?
He's such a nice boy.

47:36.935 --> 47:38.520
Here, little girl.

47:39.187 --> 47:41.773
I told you
not to give your money away.

47:45.944 --> 47:48.113
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

47:48.864 --> 47:50.949
You see?
You never get rid of them.

47:55.704 --> 47:57.581
May I help you?

48:01.877 --> 48:03.920
Would you like to buy a flower?

48:05.046 --> 48:07.257
Would you like to buy a flower?

48:07.549 --> 48:09.259
- Would you?
- Not today.

48:11.261 --> 48:13.847
Would you like to buy a flower?

48:24.399 --> 48:25.358
Would you?

48:37.746 --> 48:38.580
Pardon me.

48:46.546 --> 48:48.006
Give her a flower.

48:48.798 --> 48:49.799
Wait!

48:57.307 --> 48:58.642
For the princess.

50:37.198 --> 50:39.075
What is it, little mouse?

50:39.617 --> 50:41.619
Are you a prisoner too?

50:45.623 --> 50:48.835
Is it ever this cold
where you come from?

50:49.586 --> 50:50.837
No.

50:52.213 --> 50:56.634
Tell me about it, Sara.
Tell me again about India.

51:02.640 --> 51:03.767
India.

51:04.184 --> 51:05.518
Tell me.

51:06.478 --> 51:07.604
Well...

51:08.396 --> 51:10.982
...the air is so hot there...

51:12.192 --> 51:14.694
...you can almost taste it.

51:16.404 --> 51:18.656
I bet it tastes like coconuts.

51:20.033 --> 51:22.660
It's more like spices, really.

51:23.328 --> 51:25.330
Curry and saffron.

51:26.331 --> 51:27.332
What else?

51:32.003 --> 51:34.881
Tigers sleep under trees...

51:35.673 --> 51:39.260
...and elephants cool themselves
in the lakes.

51:39.844 --> 51:43.097
The warm wind blows
through the fields...

51:43.598 --> 51:45.975
...and the spirits ride it...

51:46.518 --> 51:49.187
...singing as they look down on us.

51:49.854 --> 51:53.191
Their voices echo
through the mountains...

51:53.691 --> 51:55.443
...and the sky...

51:55.693 --> 51:57.654
...is all different colors...

51:59.030 --> 52:01.282
...like a peacock's tail.

54:06.783 --> 54:10.161
Soot all over the place,
you clumsy fool!

54:10.369 --> 54:11.329
Get out!

54:11.537 --> 54:13.331
Get out of my house!

54:13.956 --> 54:16.626
And you can forget
being paid this week!

54:16.876 --> 54:18.753
Ungrateful little wretch.

54:19.170 --> 54:20.713
No, you don't!

54:20.963 --> 54:23.966
I won't tolerate
any soot in this house!

54:24.217 --> 54:28.179
There, just look at my boot!
It's filthy!

54:29.388 --> 54:30.223
Out!

54:30.473 --> 54:34.435
Out! And take this
ridiculous-looking thing with you!

55:41.252 --> 55:43.963
Where might Miss Amelia be
this morning?

55:44.213 --> 55:47.633
Good morning, Frances.
You're here early this morning.

55:47.883 --> 55:52.305
A working man gets up early if he
wants to have an effect on the world.

55:52.555 --> 55:53.764
How true.

55:54.223 --> 55:57.226
And what a powerful effect you have,
Frances.

56:37.850 --> 56:39.602
Where have you been?

56:39.852 --> 56:44.106
I've been chilled for half an hour.
Hurry up and light a fire.

56:44.523 --> 56:47.735
And don't touch anything
else with your dirty hands.

56:48.069 --> 56:52.073
This is my room now,
and I won't have you messing it up.

56:56.660 --> 57:01.665
What is that awful smell?
When did you last have a bath?

57:09.340 --> 57:11.008
What are you doing?

57:11.425 --> 57:13.427
I don't believe in this!

57:14.011 --> 57:17.640
So you can just stop it!
Stop it, I said!

57:22.436 --> 57:24.104
What did you just do?

57:24.313 --> 57:27.107
Just a little curse I learned
from a witch in India.

57:27.358 --> 57:28.609
Curse?

57:31.070 --> 57:33.697
- What kind of curse?
- You'll see.

57:34.114 --> 57:37.910
But I wouldn't brush my hair as much
if I were you.

57:50.130 --> 57:53.467
It's all right.
I saved it especially for you.

57:54.635 --> 57:56.554
Go on. Take it.

58:23.330 --> 58:25.291
Is this where you live?

58:25.541 --> 58:29.253
You shouldn't be here.
It's too dangerous.

58:30.087 --> 58:34.216
Why don't you like me anymore?
Did I do something wrong?

58:34.466 --> 58:36.260
No, of course not.

58:36.510 --> 58:40.014
I didn't think you'd
want me for a friend...

58:40.723 --> 58:43.517
...now that things are different.

58:44.059 --> 58:47.438
I'm sure you could do fine without
me for a friend...

58:47.688 --> 58:50.524
...but I couldn't get along
without you.

58:52.151 --> 58:53.694
I'm sorry.
I should've known...

58:53.902 --> 58:56.572
...you wouldn't be like the others.

58:56.822 --> 58:59.700
- What's that?
- One knock means ''I'm here. ''

59:01.285 --> 59:03.912
Two knocks means ''All is well. ''

59:04.538 --> 59:07.166
Three means
''The coast is clear. ''

59:07.416 --> 59:12.087
- ''The demon Minchinweed is asleep. ''
- It all sounds so adventurous!

59:12.338 --> 59:14.965
Look, Becky. We have a visitor.

59:15.466 --> 59:17.176
Hello, Becky.

59:18.052 --> 59:21.055
Oh, Sara, I miss your stories so much.

59:21.680 --> 59:25.642
Won't you tell us what happened
to Rama and the princess?

59:25.893 --> 59:28.520
The smoke from Ravana 's arrows...

59:28.771 --> 59:31.106
...finally began to lift.

59:31.940 --> 59:33.984
Rama lay dead on the ground.

59:34.735 --> 59:36.028
Oh, no!

59:36.278 --> 59:39.114
But then
a wonderful thing happened.

59:40.115 --> 59:44.995
The gazelle laid down next to Rama,
giving him his own life.

59:57.049 --> 59:59.343
He's suffering from amnesia...

59:59.593 --> 01:00:02.596
...one of the rare side effects
of poison gas.

01:00:02.846 --> 01:00:05.099
His eyes will heal in time.

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:07.976
His memory...who can say?

01:00:08.227 --> 01:00:09.770
He's not my son.

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:14.108
I'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.

01:00:14.942 --> 01:00:16.819
He was in severe shock...

01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:19.738
...with no coat, no identification.

01:00:20.531 --> 01:00:23.575
Since your son was the only name
unaccounted for...

01:00:23.826 --> 01:00:26.120
...they assumed this was John.

01:00:27.955 --> 01:00:29.540
I am sorry.

01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:42.136
All the hoping.
You must think me a fool.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.722
Is it your wish to be wise, sahib?

01:00:46.056 --> 01:00:47.558
I don't know.

01:00:48.559 --> 01:00:52.104
I suppose a wise man
wouldn't have come here at all.

01:00:52.354 --> 01:00:53.689
But if he had...

01:00:53.939 --> 01:00:57.401
...he would have looked
closely upon the soldier's face.

01:00:59.403 --> 01:01:01.029
What would he have seen?

01:01:01.238 --> 01:01:05.242
Pain, sahib.
He needs to be cared for.

01:01:06.827 --> 01:01:08.704
He's not my responsibility.

01:01:08.954 --> 01:01:13.166
A wise man would remember
that this man was in John's regiment.

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:18.547
If his memory returns, he might
tell what happened to his son.

01:01:20.632 --> 01:01:24.887
Perhaps sahib will learn
that John is in British hospital...

01:01:25.137 --> 01:01:30.267
...wishing that a kind man would
take him home, away from his pain.

01:01:35.063 --> 01:01:38.066
If the plumber comes,
show him the problem.

01:01:38.317 --> 01:01:41.528
And don't babble with him.
He's paid by the hour.

01:01:41.778 --> 01:01:45.157
And correct the Latin tests
by the time I get back.

01:01:45.407 --> 01:01:46.658
Yes, sister.

01:01:52.122 --> 01:01:54.207
Hello, Miss Minchin.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:57.085
Goodbye, Miss Minchin.

01:02:24.738 --> 01:02:25.989
Oh, no, not again!

01:02:31.453 --> 01:02:32.829
Lottie, not again.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:54.893
Let's find the locket.

01:02:56.728 --> 01:02:58.355
All right...

01:02:59.356 --> 01:03:01.525
...it's okay. It's all right.

01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:33.598
Come quick!
I think Lottie's possessed.

01:04:04.963 --> 01:04:05.922
I got it.

01:04:11.845 --> 01:04:14.764
Will you please get that child
under control?

01:04:14.973 --> 01:04:16.933
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

01:04:47.339 --> 01:04:48.465
What is it?

01:04:51.635 --> 01:04:53.470
I thought I saw a mouse.

01:05:13.448 --> 01:05:14.908
Hello.

01:05:24.167 --> 01:05:26.836
I swear, that child has
a pact with Satan to destroy me.

01:05:27.087 --> 01:05:29.881
I'm not cut out for this job.
I have no patience.

01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:33.176
And teaching!
All those facts to remember.

01:05:33.426 --> 01:05:35.011
I don't like it at all.

01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:37.681
You like Frances, don't you?

01:05:37.931 --> 01:05:39.015
What?

01:05:39.557 --> 01:05:42.352
Of course not. How dare you.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:44.020
I think he likes you too.

01:05:45.897 --> 01:05:47.273
You do?

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:49.359
Really?

01:05:49.567 --> 01:05:52.529
I think you should run away
and get married.

01:05:52.737 --> 01:05:55.073
It'd be terribly romantic.

01:05:55.907 --> 01:05:58.410
What an extraordinary thing to say.

01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:12.632
Well, anyway, my sister would be
furious if she found out.

01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:15.093
You'd be long gone by then.

01:06:15.385 --> 01:06:17.887
Living in some exotic paradise...

01:06:18.138 --> 01:06:21.057
...with that dashing young milkman.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.271
I'd better get to the market.

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:49.460
You're doing well, young man.

01:06:49.752 --> 01:06:51.462
You're almost home.

01:06:53.715 --> 01:06:56.718
You must trust my eyes, sahib.

01:07:24.871 --> 01:07:26.289
What's going on?

01:07:26.539 --> 01:07:27.790
It's a surprise.

01:07:32.629 --> 01:07:35.882
- What are you doing here?
- We brought you something.

01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:44.140
Princess Sara, we present you with
something we rescued.

01:07:44.849 --> 01:07:46.517
In a dangerous adventure.

01:07:46.726 --> 01:07:49.812
- Our very own crusade.
- Risking all our lives.

01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:51.522
And mine too.

01:08:00.031 --> 01:08:02.283
I don't know what to say.

01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:09.123
You are the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

01:08:12.961 --> 01:08:13.795
It's all right.

01:08:14.045 --> 01:08:17.006
It's just my little monkey friend,
Hanuman.

01:08:18.049 --> 01:08:20.551
Where did he come from?

01:08:20.969 --> 01:08:22.804
Right next door. Look.

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.015
He likes to visit me.

01:08:26.557 --> 01:08:28.725
Can you really talk to him, Sara?

01:08:29.977 --> 01:08:33.314
Hanuman, say hello to all my friends.

01:08:54.502 --> 01:08:57.462
After Rama came back to life...

01:08:57.714 --> 01:09:01.676
...he raced towards the monster's
palace to rescue Sita.

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:02.885
Suddenly...

01:09:03.428 --> 01:09:05.388
...Ravana appeared!

01:09:20.194 --> 01:09:23.448
I think we better save
the rest for later.

01:09:41.299 --> 01:09:43.009
What's going on here?

01:09:43.468 --> 01:09:45.928
It's not their fault.
I asked them to come.

01:09:46.179 --> 01:09:47.763
You five go downstairs.

01:09:47.971 --> 01:09:49.557
I'll deal with you later.

01:09:51.017 --> 01:09:51.893
Becky...

01:09:52.435 --> 01:09:56.105
...you'll remain locked in your room
tomorrow without meals.

01:09:56.355 --> 01:09:57.356
Go!

01:10:00.318 --> 01:10:04.030
And you will perform her chores
in addition to your own...

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.824
...without breakfast, lunch or dinner.

01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:08.576
It's time you learned...

01:10:08.784 --> 01:10:12.622
...that real life has nothing to do
with your fantasy games.

01:10:12.872 --> 01:10:15.499
It's a cruel,
nasty world out there...

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.461
...and it's our duty
to make the best of it.

01:10:18.711 --> 01:10:23.841
Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams,
but to be productive and useful.

01:10:27.261 --> 01:10:29.972
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:10:32.683 --> 01:10:34.060
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.688
Good.

01:10:40.233 --> 01:10:42.985
But I don't believe in it.

01:10:46.113 --> 01:10:49.200
Don't tell me you still
fancy yourself a princess.

01:10:50.159 --> 01:10:52.703
Good God, child, look around you!

01:10:53.204 --> 01:10:55.831
Or better yet, look in the mirror.

01:11:03.547 --> 01:11:05.174
I am a princess.

01:11:05.424 --> 01:11:07.051
All girls are.

01:11:07.385 --> 01:11:10.137
Even if they live
in tiny old attics.

01:11:10.429 --> 01:11:12.723
Even if they dress in rags.

01:11:13.599 --> 01:11:17.061
Even if they aren't pretty
or smart or young.

01:11:17.478 --> 01:11:21.148
They're still princesses.
All of us.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.944
Didn't your father ever tell you that?

01:11:25.736 --> 01:11:26.904
Didn't he?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.703
If I find you up here
with the girls again...

01:11:33.953 --> 01:11:36.580
...I'll throw you out
into the street!

01:12:10.072 --> 01:12:11.699
What're we going to do?

01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:15.494
A whole day with nothing to eat.

01:12:16.036 --> 01:12:17.788
Don't cry, Becky.

01:12:18.122 --> 01:12:19.749
I'm scared.

01:12:19.999 --> 01:12:23.544
If Minchin throws me out,
I've got no place to go.

01:12:24.754 --> 01:12:26.255
That's not true.

01:12:26.756 --> 01:12:31.385
I'm here with you. I've always
thought of us as sisters.

01:12:32.136 --> 01:12:33.345
You have?

01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:37.141
Let's make a promise
to always look out for each other.

01:12:37.433 --> 01:12:38.517
It's a promise.

01:12:41.479 --> 01:12:44.607
Now, what are we going to do
about food?

01:12:45.483 --> 01:12:47.193
Starve, I guess.

01:12:47.443 --> 01:12:50.613
No, there's only one thing to do.

01:12:50.863 --> 01:12:53.949
We'll eat a great feast
before we go to sleep...

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.494
...and that will
keep us full tomorrow.

01:12:56.702 --> 01:12:59.538
Feast? What feast?

01:12:59.788 --> 01:13:01.665
Just look around.

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.668
See that table there?

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:07.505
It's covered with a beautiful cloth...

01:13:07.755 --> 01:13:09.006
...and candles...

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.092
...and trays
of good things to eat.

01:13:13.928 --> 01:13:15.179
Come on, Becky.

01:13:15.471 --> 01:13:18.557
Tell me what kind of food there is.

01:13:19.099 --> 01:13:21.644
But I don't see any food.

01:13:21.894 --> 01:13:23.604
Try, Becky.

01:13:23.896 --> 01:13:27.566
Just make-believe it.
Remember what you told me?

01:13:27.816 --> 01:13:29.526
About the magic?

01:13:38.953 --> 01:13:41.997
- Muffins?
- Good! What kind?

01:13:42.248 --> 01:13:43.832
All kinds.

01:13:44.083 --> 01:13:48.671
Every kind of muffin God ever made,
and all of them hot.

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:50.381
Good!

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.303
But we're not dressed right
for such an elegant banquet.

01:13:58.806 --> 01:14:03.435
I'm wearing a long velvet cape
with fur on the collar.

01:14:03.894 --> 01:14:04.770
And you?

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.148
Well,
I always liked diamonds myself.

01:14:08.565 --> 01:14:12.945
Rings and bracelets,
and a whole dress covered with them.

01:14:15.114 --> 01:14:17.324
Smell those sausages!

01:14:17.574 --> 01:14:19.284
I love sausages.

01:15:50.918 --> 01:15:52.377
Oh, my Lord!

01:15:54.838 --> 01:15:57.716
I think you went
a little too far this time.

01:15:57.966 --> 01:15:59.468
It wasn't me.

01:16:04.264 --> 01:16:05.766
Go ahead.

01:16:19.321 --> 01:16:22.407
I feel like I've been
touched by an angel.

01:16:22.658 --> 01:16:23.617
Look!

01:16:23.909 --> 01:16:25.410
Just what we ordered.

01:16:26.203 --> 01:16:28.288
I'm a little scared about this.

01:16:29.039 --> 01:16:31.750
Me too.
Do you think we shouldn't eat it?

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.460
I'm not that scared.

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.352
Thank you for your kindness.
I'm sorry to inconvenience you.

01:16:50.602 --> 01:16:51.937
It is nothing, sahib.

01:16:57.818 --> 01:16:58.986
That word...

01:17:01.238 --> 01:17:02.906
It sounds so familiar...

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.618
...yet I don't know what it means.

01:17:06.868 --> 01:17:10.455
It is not English.
We use it where I am from.

01:17:11.290 --> 01:17:12.624
In India.

01:17:15.544 --> 01:17:16.461
India...

01:17:16.837 --> 01:17:18.171
You know it?

01:17:21.341 --> 01:17:22.509
No.

01:17:23.677 --> 01:17:25.804
Everything's just a blur.

01:17:29.266 --> 01:17:31.476
Maybe someday I'll sort it out.

01:17:32.311 --> 01:17:33.937
You will, sahib.

01:17:35.314 --> 01:17:36.857
You will.

01:18:33.497 --> 01:18:35.040
Yoo-hoo?

01:18:53.809 --> 01:18:55.060
One minute.

01:19:20.502 --> 01:19:21.836
Oh, my God.

01:19:35.433 --> 01:19:37.060
Where is it?

01:19:37.519 --> 01:19:38.853
Where's the locket?

01:19:39.104 --> 01:19:40.855
Give it to me!

01:19:44.359 --> 01:19:45.735
What is all this?

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.196
Where'd it come from?

01:19:48.446 --> 01:19:50.824
I don't know.
I just woke up and it was here.

01:19:51.074 --> 01:19:53.868
You stole it,
like you stole this locket!

01:19:54.744 --> 01:19:57.080
You're nothing but a dirty
little thief.

01:19:57.539 --> 01:20:01.960
It's my responsibility to protect
the children from animals like you.

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:05.880
You'll be leaving
with the police very shortly!

01:20:07.966 --> 01:20:09.801
No, Miss Minchin!

01:20:10.427 --> 01:20:11.970
I didn't do it.

01:20:12.637 --> 01:20:14.431
Miss Minchin, please!

01:20:14.681 --> 01:20:17.225
Miss Minchin, I didn't do it!

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:35.201
You heard me.
I want her picked up immediately!

01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.222
You've removed the bandages.

01:20:56.473 --> 01:20:59.517
There wasn't much point.
I can see all right.

01:21:00.477 --> 01:21:02.687
Come on in, have a brandy.

01:21:17.285 --> 01:21:18.912
Don't worry.

01:21:19.746 --> 01:21:21.998
I'm sure they'll believe you.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:25.627
I have to get out.

01:21:25.877 --> 01:21:29.339
But how? My room's locked too.

01:21:42.977 --> 01:21:44.187
The police, they're here!

01:21:46.606 --> 01:21:49.359
Let's go, boys.
Step lively now.

01:22:03.957 --> 01:22:06.209
Quick, help me with this board!

01:22:06.459 --> 01:22:08.753
- Right this way.
- Yes, madam.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.103
You'll fall!

01:22:26.312 --> 01:22:27.856
I can do it.

01:22:28.106 --> 01:22:31.818
I'll come back for you.
I promise.

01:22:59.262 --> 01:23:00.972
What is she doing?

01:23:01.764 --> 01:23:03.266
Get back in here!

01:23:30.501 --> 01:23:35.006
- The little beast is running away!
- We're trying, miss.

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:55.109
Good God!

01:24:14.754 --> 01:24:17.799
Don't just stand there!
Go and find her!

01:24:23.638 --> 01:24:25.932
Take this one while you're at it.

01:24:41.614 --> 01:24:44.742
I heard you calling
in your sleep last night.

01:24:45.284 --> 01:24:49.247
Sometimes when I dream,
I sense a part of me that's missing.

01:24:49.997 --> 01:24:53.709
It's strange, having your heart
remember what your mind can't.

01:24:57.421 --> 01:24:59.298
She jumped like a little animal.

01:25:02.885 --> 01:25:04.637
Who's that at this hour?

01:25:10.393 --> 01:25:11.477
Let us in, man.

01:25:12.311 --> 01:25:15.064
A child from the school
is in your house.

01:25:15.314 --> 01:25:16.482
What's going on?

01:25:16.774 --> 01:25:19.402
I'm sorry, but there's a child
hiding in your house.

01:25:19.694 --> 01:25:21.279
- What?
- Search upstairs.

01:25:25.283 --> 01:25:26.492
Oh, not now!

01:25:26.784 --> 01:25:28.661
Ram Dass, get some candles!

01:25:32.707 --> 01:25:35.251
- Start with the attic.
- Let's go.

01:25:35.543 --> 01:25:36.502
Quickly!

01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:40.006
Who's there?

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.192
Make sure you check the closets
and under the beds!

01:26:06.365 --> 01:26:07.658
What is it?

01:26:08.284 --> 01:26:09.744
Why are you crying?

01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:17.293
Please tell me.
I won't hurt you.

01:26:19.211 --> 01:26:21.005
Won't you tell me your name?

01:26:34.393 --> 01:26:36.354
That's such a pretty name.

01:26:51.786 --> 01:26:53.037
Papa.

01:27:00.836 --> 01:27:02.088
Papa.

01:27:02.755 --> 01:27:03.964
What did you say?

01:27:05.591 --> 01:27:08.469
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, it's me, Sara.

01:27:08.761 --> 01:27:09.929
Do you know me?

01:27:10.221 --> 01:27:11.555
Don't you remember me?

01:27:12.014 --> 01:27:13.057
Please...

01:27:13.307 --> 01:27:16.310
...you've got to know me.
It's Sara. Remember?

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.771
Remember India and Maya?

01:27:19.063 --> 01:27:20.398
Remember the Ramayana...

01:27:20.773 --> 01:27:23.651
...and Emily?
The locket with Mama's picture?

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.195
Oh, Papa, please!

01:27:27.238 --> 01:27:28.155
Papa, please!

01:27:28.406 --> 01:27:29.573
Do you know this man?

01:27:29.824 --> 01:27:30.741
Tell them!

01:27:34.203 --> 01:27:37.373
This child has no father.
Take her away!

01:27:41.794 --> 01:27:42.795
Papa!

01:27:43.379 --> 01:27:45.089
I'm so sorry.

01:28:09.655 --> 01:28:10.781
Sara!

01:28:20.416 --> 01:28:22.793
Papa, don't ever leave me!

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:37.892
- I missed you.
- I love you.

01:29:34.365 --> 01:29:37.743
Well, well, well.
I hardly recognized you.

01:29:38.410 --> 01:29:40.704
I'm glad you straightened
everything out.

01:29:40.913 --> 01:29:43.290
They released all my property.

01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:45.876
I came to say goodbye...

01:29:46.085 --> 01:29:49.338
...and to thank you
for everything you've done for us.

01:29:49.838 --> 01:29:52.466
No more than you tried to do for my son.

01:29:53.926 --> 01:29:57.137
- Take care, Mr. Randolph.
- And you too.

01:29:57.554 --> 01:30:00.432
You must be glad
to be going home.

01:30:01.517 --> 01:30:02.476
Thank you.

01:30:26.875 --> 01:30:29.128
I have a surprise for you all.

01:30:33.632 --> 01:30:38.595
Whenever you think of me, tell Emily,
and she'll get the message to me.

01:30:39.012 --> 01:30:43.058
And when you hug her, you'll really
be getting a hug from me.

01:30:43.267 --> 01:30:45.394
Then we'll hug her every day.

01:31:13.172 --> 01:31:15.966
That's the first time
anyone's hugged Lavinia.

01:31:20.179 --> 01:31:21.555
Bye, Becky.

01:31:22.514 --> 01:31:23.724
Come on.

01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:34.067
Yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:31:34.484 --> 01:31:37.946
Get over here.
I've been looking for you, Minchin.

01:31:38.155 --> 01:31:40.782
- Pick up the bucket.
- When do I get my break?

01:31:40.991 --> 01:31:42.326
Follow me!

01:31:43.202 --> 01:31:45.579
What do you put in here, rocks?

01:31:53.670 --> 01:31:54.463
Bye, Ram Dass!

01:31:54.713 --> 01:31:57.174
- Bye, Hanuman!
- Cheerio!
