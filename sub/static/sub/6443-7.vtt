00:02.646 --> 00:03.605
<i>Here's the kickoff.</i>

00:03.891 --> 00:08.237
<i>The winner of today's game will move on to
the state championship 1 week from today.</i>

00:14.062 --> 00:15.943
<i>Play your game, buddy.</i>

00:19.527 --> 00:24.391
<i>A victory today will send the crows to
the state championship.</i>

00:28.204 --> 00:31.357
So, are you the guy?

00:31.926 --> 00:34.803
I guess that depends on what
you're looking for.

00:35.351 --> 00:39.528
Mikhail Mxyzl...

00:39.679 --> 00:42.052
Mxyzptlk.

00:42.162 --> 00:44.425
Let me guess, you want to buy a vowel.

00:44.786 --> 00:47.073
No, I just wanted to put 80 on the game.

00:47.092 --> 00:52.070
You mean the game that started already.
Sorry I can't take a bet after the kickoff.

00:55.544 --> 00:57.161
Rookie, huh?

00:57.893 --> 01:01.936
Well, maybe in your case,
I'll make an exception.

01:02.419 --> 01:07.028
Thanks. Can you
put me down for Smallville to win?

01:08.359 --> 01:13.046
You sure about that? I have a funny
feeling about the quarterback today.

01:13.403 --> 01:17.293
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I
never bet against Clark Kent.

01:17.938 --> 01:21.812
Suit yourself. Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:21.972 --> 01:25.634
Rule #1: A bet is a bet.

Season 4 Episode 5

03:29.048 --> 03:31.548
Original Airdate Nov. 3, 2004

04:26.740 --> 04:28.431
Is he okay?

04:28.564 --> 04:31.279
His collarbone's broken in 2 places.

04:31.567 --> 04:36.073
I can't figure out how you could pommel
a guy that outweighs you by 100 pounds,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.590
and shatter his collarbone.

04:38.596 --> 04:40.556
I'm sorry.

04:41.904 --> 04:45.758
Must have been an accident, I mean,
I got a surge of adrenaline.

04:45.816 --> 04:49.324
Adrenaline doesn't explain the fact that
you went from chucking bails of hay

04:49.385 --> 04:51.842
to chucking 60-yard passes overnight.

04:52.548 --> 04:56.045
I guess I'm a fast learner, you said
yourself I was a natural.

04:56.108 --> 04:59.406
A natural who adamantly refuses to get a
doctor after he collapsed 2 weeks ago.

04:59.407 --> 05:01.247
What are you trying to say?

05:01.308 --> 05:06.619
Coach Quigley thinks you're on some kind
of performance-enhancing drug.

05:07.966 --> 05:10.221
Like steroids?

05:11.999 --> 05:13.264
What do you think?

05:13.737 --> 05:18.518
I put myself on the line and said there's
no way Clark Kent would do that.

05:21.516 --> 05:22.917
I'm not on drugs.

05:22.995 --> 05:27.828
I hope not. Because if it comes out you're
not on the same playing field as these guys,

05:28.039 --> 05:32.924
it's gonna be pretty disappointing to
forfeit an entire championship season.

05:34.806 --> 05:37.461
And a college career.

05:50.978 --> 05:55.253
I can't imagine what it must have been
like to grow up in a war-torn country.

05:55.646 --> 06:01.580
Obviously. This is as far you can get
from scavenging the street, but,

06:02.100 --> 06:07.492
Growing up "hand-to-mouth" does tend to
make you resourceful.

06:09.039 --> 06:13.871
Resourceful enough to get the attention of
my father's LuthorCorp foreign scholarship.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.904
So how do you like Smallville high.

06:19.389 --> 06:23.305
I think it is the perfect place for me to
make my American dream.

06:23.663 --> 06:28.880
There are many opportunities,
and the girls are... pretty.

06:31.064 --> 06:34.115
I hope the classes aren't
too difficult for you.

06:37.456 --> 06:42.906
I reviewed your application; I must say I was
surprised by your poor test scores and grades.

06:46.499 --> 06:51.660
Look Mikhail, I'm just curious why
my father would award a scholarship,

06:52.490 --> 06:57.202
historically earmarked for future Nobel-
prize-winners to a perennial "C" student.

06:57.802 --> 06:59.193
You want to send me back.

07:00.038 --> 07:01.356
No.

07:01.849 --> 07:04.820
I'd just like to know
what you're really doing here.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.443
What potential did my father
see in you, Mikhail?

07:10.183 --> 07:11.694
Cut.

07:17.657 --> 07:22.325
Potential you do not see on a
report card, Mr. Luthor.

07:37.517 --> 07:38.682
Hey!

07:39.213 --> 07:43.179
I didn't realize bookies made house calls,
especially after-hours.

07:43.266 --> 07:46.335
Well, I guess I just walked into
the Lion's mouth, eh?

07:46.390 --> 07:48.701
What are you talking about?

07:49.641 --> 07:53.758
You're a first timer, and you show up at the
end of the season, I asked some questions.

07:54.708 --> 08:00.919
I don't think it is coincidence that you are
Smallville's most notorious whistle-blower.

08:01.394 --> 08:04.283
Notorious, huh? I like the sound of that.

08:05.145 --> 08:10.698
- This bet was just research for the article?
- Front page if you play your cards right.

08:11.442 --> 08:16.938
I don't suppose that being a local
celebrity will be good for business.

08:17.307 --> 08:20.304
I think maybe you should
change professions.

08:22.046 --> 08:23.782
You just found my Achilles' Heel.

08:23.900 --> 08:28.818
- What, greed?
- No, pretty girls with infectious smiles.

08:31.630 --> 08:35.243
I'm still writing the article.

08:35.589 --> 08:40.544
If you don't even know when to place a bet,
I don't think you have the inside scoop

08:40.609 --> 08:47.134
you're looking for. Promise not to mention
my name, and I'll let you "shadow" me,

08:47.175 --> 08:52.034
I'll be your personal escort through
the seedier parts of Smallville.

08:53.954 --> 08:57.123
If I cut you a break, I expect a full
behind-the-scenes story.

08:57.135 --> 09:01.868
Of course, and the first stop
is the Winner's Circle.

09:13.796 --> 09:16.550
So, what are you going to do
with the money?

09:18.237 --> 09:21.783
- Textbooks.
- Ooh, don't go too crazy, huh?

09:22.118 --> 09:27.079
My dad's on unemployment, so my college
fund took a massive hit this year.

09:27.346 --> 09:31.693
How would you like to make enough money to
pay an entire semester of tuition

09:32.020 --> 09:35.041
before you wake up
tomorrow morning?

09:35.582 --> 09:39.964
I have to go to the Shark's game
in Metropolis tonight. Sharks...

09:40.376 --> 09:42.147
8-to-1.

09:42.294 --> 09:47.302
Chloe, if you want the big article you have
to get inside the mind of a gambler.

09:47.647 --> 09:50.118
You have to be ready to raise the stakes.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.960
That is, if you aren't scared.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.295
Count me in.

10:12.108 --> 10:15.352
There's more to life than
championships, Clark.

10:15.492 --> 10:18.612
I bet it's easy to say that when
you have one.

10:18.971 --> 10:22.856
Dad, when I put on that uniform,
it's like I forget who I am,

10:22.870 --> 10:27.625
but at the same time, I've never known
myself better. It's more than just a game.

10:27.682 --> 10:31.727
Clark, I allowed you join the football
team because I though you understood

10:31.735 --> 10:34.115
your responsibility not to let anybody
get hurt out there.

10:34.120 --> 10:37.810
And I accepted that responsibility because
I know I can control my abilities.

10:37.817 --> 10:40.872
Then explain to me why there's a kid lying
in a hospital bed right now?

10:40.880 --> 10:44.360
Have you ever seen me trip... Ever?

10:45.396 --> 10:48.724
Something happened out on that field,
it's like I couldn't control my own legs!

10:49.170 --> 10:52.585
Just because you are strong, doesn't mean
you can't get rattled out there like

10:52.595 --> 10:57.595
anybody else. I'm sorry but the last place
you should be is on that football field and

10:57.605 --> 11:04.330
you know it. Coach Quigley's at the party
tonight. I'll call him and be the bad guy.

11:04.340 --> 11:10.321
No, Dad. Like you said,
It's my responsibility.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.377
Coach, can I talk to you for a second?

11:31.491 --> 11:32.891
What's up?

11:33.188 --> 11:38.588
Kent, you saved the day! What a play!
You put us in the championship!

11:38.692 --> 11:41.456
No, the team put us in the championship.

11:41.775 --> 11:45.107
- I can see the ring on my finger already.
- I can see the scholarships lined up.

11:48.127 --> 11:49.667
Clark, you're here!

12:00.795 --> 12:06.186
Coach, coach, coach!

12:10.361 --> 12:13.845
Topeka West may have 3 titles under it's belt,

12:14.366 --> 12:18.967
but I know we have a real shot at the
championship, and this year we got it all.

12:19.038 --> 12:22.477
An impenetrable defense,
an aggressive offense...

12:22.873 --> 12:25.626
And a GOLDEN ARM!

12:28.197 --> 12:32.389
Let's go take the title home!

12:33.883 --> 12:36.462
Kent, Kent, Kent, Kent!

12:55.501 --> 12:57.821
I like the new textbooks!

12:58.145 --> 13:02.062
Hi! Don't worry, I just took 10 percent
off the top for fun, the rest of my

13:02.182 --> 13:05.901
winnings are tucked safely away
for college tuition.

13:05.995 --> 13:08.999
I'm glad that my tip paid off for you.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.757
Are you kidding me?
That game was awesome!

13:11.861 --> 13:16.095
I haven't had that much fun on a couch
since Johnny Rosenblatt in 5th grade!

13:16.177 --> 13:20.714
I mean, all of those painted "beer-bellies"
and foam hands suddenly make sense

13:20.774 --> 13:22.690
when you have something riding on the game!

13:22.817 --> 13:26.895
See, why would want to spoil all the fun
by writing that article?

13:26.956 --> 13:30.757
Because it just keeps getting
juicier by the minute.

13:30.793 --> 13:33.161
Are you sure about that?

13:34.119 --> 13:36.973
Why, are you going to do something
to change my mind?

13:37.857 --> 13:40.787
Nice try, you're very cute. But I already
gave you anonymity, and

13:41.104 --> 13:44.490
- it's going to press tonight.
- But you're only starting to scratch

13:44.503 --> 13:47.845
the surface, and I can give you
so much more "dirt".

13:49.600 --> 13:52.042
You're just trying to stall
the article, aren't you?

13:53.336 --> 13:56.363
I don't think you understand me, Chloe.

13:57.463 --> 14:00.308
I always get what I want.

14:01.356 --> 14:04.770
On looks, apparently, because your
charm just ran out.

14:05.149 --> 14:06.006
Stop.

14:09.739 --> 14:11.059
Kiss me.

14:22.650 --> 14:25.456
This is me asking you nicely.

14:25.818 --> 14:30.795
Now you're going to drop that article,
whether you want to or not.

15:33.523 --> 15:36.179
I've never seen you miss before.

15:37.928 --> 15:42.298
I've also never seen you shrink from
responsibility, no matter how difficult.

15:42.366 --> 15:45.807
You saw the look on those guys' faces, I
couldn't let them down.

15:46.352 --> 15:49.797
I just thought I could find a way to
play like everyone else.

15:51.588 --> 15:55.757
Clark. Open your hand.

16:00.156 --> 16:02.111
What are you doing?

16:02.171 --> 16:04.394
You know how dangerous Kryptonite is!

16:04.408 --> 16:06.063
I always get better after it's gone.

16:06.103 --> 16:09.058
So what if I'm playing sick?
Other guys play injured.

16:09.895 --> 16:12.420
And if Dad know I don't have my abilities
and can't hurt anyone.

16:12.425 --> 16:17.410
You are not taking meteor rocks on that field,
I know it's hard, you can't make yourself sick!

16:17.425 --> 16:18.780
And I can't quit either!

16:18.795 --> 16:21.320
Clark, the answer is no.

16:23.013 --> 16:26.314
You asked your father if we'd ever seen
you trip before... Never.

16:26.631 --> 16:28.796
Not without Kryptonite.

16:32.107 --> 16:36.921
I was so excited to see you get a chance
to be like everyone else, that

16:36.985 --> 16:39.988
I guess I forgot for a moment
that you aren't.

16:40.135 --> 16:42.709
I didn't think anything of it when you
tripped, but

16:42.764 --> 16:46.560
you've never had mishaps like other kids.

16:49.013 --> 16:52.004
Something happened to you out there.

16:52.291 --> 16:55.456
And if you really want to play in
the game on Saturday,

16:55.495 --> 16:58.435
you need to find out what it was.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.646
It's alright Clark, you can stay.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.953
I thought you had some self-imposed
restraining order against me,

17:15.954 --> 17:17.640
does this mean you're talking to me again?

17:17.650 --> 17:21.512
No it just means I'm taking a chance on
getting your Dr. Jekyll side today.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.501
What's up with the self-flogging?

17:24.540 --> 17:26.682
I'm watching the sports editor's
tape of the game,

17:26.714 --> 17:29.430
Trying to figure out what happened, but...

17:30.625 --> 17:34.435
It's like I had no control, like my mind
was sending one message, but my...

17:34.438 --> 17:36.580
But your body was getting another.

17:36.695 --> 17:37.663
Yeah.

17:37.868 --> 17:39.257
It's Mikhail.

17:39.665 --> 17:41.386
The foreign exchange kid?

17:41.479 --> 17:45.599
- Mixa...
- Mxyzptlk. Say that 3 times fast.

17:45.615 --> 17:48.301
He's our new resident "Puppet Master".

17:48.816 --> 17:50.707
This is kind of embarrassing, but...

17:50.735 --> 17:53.481
he made me kiss him.

17:55.151 --> 17:56.442
Made you?

17:58.821 --> 18:01.931
Yeah, it was just like how
you explained your trip,

18:01.944 --> 18:04.249
it was like someone else was
controlling me.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.013
Ok, but, why would he want me
to throw the game?

18:07.080 --> 18:10.627
Clark, he's the biggest bookie
in the school!

18:11.381 --> 18:13.644
The power to control the odds.

18:13.916 --> 18:16.154
Let me do a search on his name.

18:17.172 --> 18:18.513
"0 Matches Found"

18:19.405 --> 18:23.463
I guess I shouldn't be surprised that
Mxyzptlk didn't bring anything up.

18:23.925 --> 18:25.950
Well what's that?

18:27.367 --> 18:31.742
"Did you mean KLTPZYXM?"
It's Mikhail's name backwards.

18:34.521 --> 18:38.101
- Looks like a nursery rhyme gone bad.
- Yeah, it's some legend from

18:38.110 --> 18:41.741
the Piatori region in the Balkans.

18:42.731 --> 18:45.757
That's near where Mikhail's from.

18:48.430 --> 18:52.470
It says the region's been terrorized for
centuries by a bloodline of people,

18:52.858 --> 18:55.722
who can control the hand of luck.

18:56.239 --> 18:59.564
It's not exactly luck if they're controlling
people. What does it say about the

18:59.575 --> 19:03.190
- backwards name?
- The family changed their name a century

19:03.195 --> 19:06.922
ago and fled the area to escape the stigma
after a village burned to the ground.

19:07.325 --> 19:09.770
Looks like Mikhail's still
running from his heritage.

19:09.903 --> 19:13.573
It doesn't exactly say how to stop the
kissing bandit, does it?

19:13.798 --> 19:14.723
Oh, here!

19:14.726 --> 19:19.135
According to the legends, the only thing
that stopped them was a plague of locusts.

19:19.317 --> 19:22.846
There may be one other force
they didn't count on.

19:24.518 --> 19:28.202
Think about it,
who brought him here in the first place?

19:29.878 --> 19:33.606
You want me to deport a
LuthorCorp exchange student?

19:34.605 --> 19:38.850
Gambling on Crows games,
isn't a sanctioned extracurricular.

19:39.075 --> 19:42.369
I'm surprised you care so much
about some half-rate bookie.

19:42.484 --> 19:45.454
Or is there something else about
Mikhail you aren't telling me?

19:45.736 --> 19:49.130
Lex, you sponsored him, I just thought
you might want to do something about it.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.139
Of course I'll look into it.

19:52.406 --> 19:56.429
I'm surprised you didn't go to the
principal first, or Coach Teague.

19:56.644 --> 20:00.039
But I see how that can be more
complicated than it sounds.

20:02.696 --> 20:05.172
Why would it be more complicated?

20:06.165 --> 20:07.443
Come on.

20:07.470 --> 20:11.295
I can't be the only one who's picked on
Lana's fondness for quarterbacks.

20:11.371 --> 20:13.584
Even retired ones.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.003
Yeah, to be honest, it has been hard
to see her with someone else.

20:20.113 --> 20:24.461
Don't worry, Paris can have a
magical effect on people, but...

20:24.551 --> 20:28.814
the enchantment has a funny way
of waning the longer you're gone.

20:29.007 --> 20:32.608
I know Lana. She's never been this
serious about anyone.

20:33.628 --> 20:38.220
You sound awfully concerned about that for
someone that let her walk out of his life.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.473
I guess the whole "If you love them, set
them free" thing kind of backfired.

20:43.591 --> 20:48.118
It's not about love, Clark. It's about
what you're willing to do for it.

20:48.959 --> 20:52.260
On that field, you'll do whatever
it takes to win.

20:52.598 --> 20:55.051
But if you're not willing to
do the same for Lana...

20:55.462 --> 20:58.814
maybe she doesn't mean as much
to you as you think.

21:07.113 --> 21:09.121
Clark on steroids.

21:09.219 --> 21:11.364
It's a little hard to picture.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.290
It happens to a lot of guys.

21:13.448 --> 21:16.753
Want so badly to outperform everyone,
before you know it, all they care about

21:16.757 --> 21:19.525
is winning, no matter what the cost.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.056
You're not responsible for Clark.

21:22.627 --> 21:24.316
Actually I am.

21:24.470 --> 21:27.795
Coach Quigley asked me to give him a drug
test, and I never mentioned it

21:27.825 --> 21:30.413
to Clark, so I lied and
said it came back clean.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.484
Why would you do that?

21:32.539 --> 21:36.913
I don't know, cause I believe in Clark!
And because he knows about us.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.994
I didn't want to stir the waters.
If he wanted to get back at me, all he

21:41.025 --> 21:43.645
has to do is tell somebody at the school,
and I lose my job.

21:43.713 --> 21:46.076
- Clark wouldn't make it personal.
- Why not?

21:46.384 --> 21:49.879
I can't imagine what I'd do if someone
tried to take you away from me.

21:50.607 --> 21:54.764
Nobody took me away from Clark, I left.

21:54.916 --> 21:56.214
Right.

21:56.383 --> 22:01.008
Clark's a big part of the reason why
I took off for Paris in the first place.

22:01.296 --> 22:05.706
Oh, that must be from the book of things you
never want to hear about your girlfriend's Ex.

22:05.710 --> 22:09.365
Look Jason, I'm with you now and I
couldn't be happier. And I know,

22:09.417 --> 22:12.285
Clark can be unpredictable,

22:12.295 --> 22:15.269
but he knows that you need
this job to stay in college.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.171
I know it's hard because
you've been so close to him...

22:21.183 --> 22:23.450
But are you sure you really know him?

22:33.133 --> 22:37.793
Don't get me wrong, Mikhail. I appreciate
your entrepreneurial ingenuity,

22:37.837 --> 22:41.412
but importing Bookies tends to reflect
poorly on a company.

22:41.432 --> 22:43.636
These are just fun games.

22:43.917 --> 22:47.353
The I.N.S. isn't exactly renowned
for their good sportsmanship.

22:47.414 --> 22:50.001
They're revoking your student visa
and sending you back home.

22:50.054 --> 22:53.007
But a man like you could pull strings
to keep me here, yes?

22:53.109 --> 22:55.287
If I wanted to.

22:55.321 --> 22:58.361
But whatever talents my father
saw in you,

22:58.399 --> 23:02.827
they're not worth the embarrassment you
bring to me and my company.

23:03.768 --> 23:08.105
I've made the arrangements, you'll be
halfway across the Atlantic by morning.

23:08.119 --> 23:10.282
You don't really want that.

23:10.565 --> 23:13.922
You want to know why your Dad brought
me here.

23:13.971 --> 23:16.411
Not that badly.

23:17.758 --> 23:19.376
What if we make a wager?

23:19.457 --> 23:22.725
Now why would I take a bet when
I can just have you thrown out of here?

23:22.734 --> 23:26.197
Because I know gamblers better than
anybody. You're the caviar kind -

23:26.260 --> 23:29.813
See when you hold everything in your
hand, the only thing that can give you a

23:29.896 --> 23:33.303
thrill, is putting your chips on the
one thing that can

23:33.325 --> 23:35.066
slip through your fingers.

23:40.168 --> 23:44.484
And what would that one thing be, Mikhail?

23:44.773 --> 23:47.137
Well in this case... Me.

23:49.599 --> 23:53.965
How much do you believe in this
quarterback friend of yours, Clark Kent?

23:56.678 --> 23:59.042
The Championship Game?

24:00.056 --> 24:01.767
What's the wager?

24:02.432 --> 24:07.401
If the Crows lose, you get Citizenship for
me, and $1 million dollars to start again.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.631
And if the Crows win,

24:10.058 --> 24:13.558
I have a hard time believing
you can cover that bet.

24:13.564 --> 24:17.334
I can't. But the reason your
father brought me here is

24:17.425 --> 24:20.313
far more valuable than just money.

24:31.201 --> 24:36.141
Oh look. A real, live, American
football superhero.

24:37.503 --> 24:39.656
What are you doing here?

24:39.685 --> 24:44.446
I came here to thank you for ratting
me out to Lex.

24:44.565 --> 24:49.084
It wasn't hard to figure out, I knew Chloe
would squeal, just not to him.

24:49.711 --> 24:51.556
She's too proud.

24:51.637 --> 24:55.599
You seemed to be the common denominator, so

24:55.646 --> 24:59.244
you forget, games are my business,

24:59.308 --> 25:03.428
so if you don't know the players,
you cannot guess the outcome.

25:03.816 --> 25:08.041
I thought you'd be halfway back to the
"village of the damned" by now.

25:08.128 --> 25:11.272
I'm not cursed, Clark.
I am lucky.

25:11.336 --> 25:16.250
And on Saturday, the championship game,
I'm going to be very lucky.

25:16.331 --> 25:18.312
If you think I'm going to lose
that game for you...

25:18.313 --> 25:23.298
If... when there is an if, there are odds,
and I always beat the odds.

25:24.788 --> 25:26.694
Choke.

25:28.661 --> 25:33.167
For example, the odds in the championship
are based on you playing.

25:33.463 --> 25:38.463
If you don't go out on the field, then my
profit margin takes an unfortunate turn.

25:38.762 --> 25:42.687
That is why you're not going to tell
anyone else about me, and

25:42.762 --> 25:46.006
you're going to be on that field.

25:46.090 --> 25:50.442
Unless, you want to see more of your
buddies in the hospital.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.248
Breathe.

26:13.391 --> 26:15.171
- Chloe.
- Hey!

26:15.239 --> 26:18.024
Clark, warm-up in 15 minutes.

26:18.038 --> 26:21.212
I sure hope you had better luck with the
locusts than I did with Lex.

26:21.235 --> 26:24.766
They aren't selling biblical plagues on
"Amazon.com", but since every legend

26:24.796 --> 26:28.269
is born in truth, I did look up our
favorite apocalyptic critters.

26:28.305 --> 26:31.799
Besides eating crops in a single bound,
what else can they do?

26:31.876 --> 26:35.640
When locusts swarm, they emit an energy
wave to avoid crashing into each other.

26:35.717 --> 26:39.845
Maybe Mikhail's commands operate on a
similar frequency, like a radio signal.

26:39.906 --> 26:43.264
Or a dog whistle, the sound travels but
the human ear doesn't pick it up.

26:43.295 --> 26:46.723
Yeah. What's interesting is once a locust's
signal is jammed, they can't fly anymore

26:46.730 --> 26:50.652
without running into each other.
It's permanent.

26:50.743 --> 26:54.386
Maybe all we have to do is find something
that will jam Mikhail's frequency for good.

26:54.399 --> 26:57.941
And I think I know where to find that,
so now we just have to find him.

26:57.944 --> 27:01.304
Knowing his quest for the American Dream,
he's got a lot of bets riding on this game,

27:01.345 --> 27:02.381
He'll be here.

27:02.411 --> 27:03.754
- Ok.
- I gotta go.

27:03.831 --> 27:04.981
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.

27:09.270 --> 27:13.219
Greetings Football fans, and welcome
to the Championship game between the

27:13.317 --> 27:17.986
Topeka Valley Huskies, and your
Smallville Crows!

28:18.850 --> 28:20.045
Clark.

28:24.889 --> 28:26.524
What are you doing?

28:26.949 --> 28:30.810
You know what Mikhail said. He'd hurt
those guys if I wasn't out there.

28:30.851 --> 28:34.733
250 pound guys banging into each other on
a football field is one thing,

28:35.336 --> 28:39.081
but getting hit by you is like getting hit
by a train, it's a big difference, son.

28:39.101 --> 28:42.126
I hope that doesn't happen. I think Chloe
and I found a way to stop Mikhail.

28:42.156 --> 28:45.596
Oh Chloe and You think you found a way to
stop. Well I'm sorry son,

28:45.605 --> 28:48.560
- thinking is not good enough.
- Dad I know you don't agree with me,

28:48.570 --> 28:51.913
but sometimes taking responsibility
means having faith in yourself to make

28:51.918 --> 28:56.138
- the hard choices.
- It also means accepting the consequences.

28:57.015 --> 29:01.580
Every handshake, every hug, every time
I'm out on that field I make the conscious

29:01.595 --> 29:05.331
decision to fall when those guys hit me
so they don't get hurt.

29:06.384 --> 29:10.509
No matter how hard you try,
you can't understand that.

29:12.242 --> 29:15.370
That's why it's my decision, not yours.

29:25.570 --> 29:29.085
You're starting to sound more
and more like your father.

29:34.275 --> 29:36.455
I hope so, Dad.

31:13.903 --> 31:15.041
Trip.

31:25.771 --> 31:28.942
Alright, let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on!

31:46.240 --> 31:47.949
Fumble.

32:56.164 --> 32:58.024
I knew it was you Chloe!

32:59.750 --> 33:01.047
Stop.

33:01.708 --> 33:05.990
Looks like someone's been broken. Sucks
when you have to play fair doesn't it?

33:06.205 --> 33:11.204
In my country, you don't survive if you
can't adapt to the unexpected.

33:23.250 --> 33:28.030
<i>1st down, the Huskies call
their last time-out!</i>

33:28.543 --> 33:30.330
Clark.

33:33.396 --> 33:35.496
What are you doing here?

33:36.875 --> 33:39.700
Here's how the last play in my game goes.

33:39.772 --> 33:43.447
The Crows score another touchdown,
Chloe's dead.

33:43.521 --> 33:48.247
If you don't go on the field right now,
and lose the game...

33:48.511 --> 33:50.176
Chloe's dead.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.981
Kent. Let's go.

33:58.428 --> 34:03.406
We need an "Ace-back Montana Post".
This is it. It's for the title.

34:06.954 --> 34:10.777
Crows have it 1st and 10 on
the 50-yard line.

34:10.891 --> 34:15.762
<i>5 seconds remaining on the clock.
Smallville has one more play.</i>

34:26.382 --> 34:28.384
Blue, 32!

34:39.928 --> 34:41.149
Hut!

35:38.777 --> 35:42.477
<i>Touchdown! The Crows win!</i>

35:44.422 --> 35:48.856
<i>Clark Kent makes another
unbelievable play!</i>

35:58.940 --> 36:02.168
Come on, man! We're missing the party!

36:23.017 --> 36:27.531
Looks like championship quarterbacks
no longer have a curfew, huh?

36:28.312 --> 36:31.385
I'm late...
Sorry.

36:35.054 --> 36:36.975
Clark.

36:38.062 --> 36:41.709
Your mother and I know that Mikhail
was arrested.

36:42.612 --> 36:47.142
Now, when I was out on that same field,
all I had to worry about

36:47.220 --> 36:51.379
was completing the next pass, or whether
or not I was going to get tackled.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.579
We're very proud of you.

36:55.668 --> 36:57.606
For everything.

37:00.821 --> 37:04.371
- Hey you, come on. Night.
- Good night.

37:07.100 --> 37:11.065
I don't know what it is with you, but no
matter how many times I put you in the

37:11.078 --> 37:13.010
penalty box, it never sticks.

37:13.229 --> 37:16.476
I hear you're quite the hero tonight,
Clark Kent.

37:16.570 --> 37:19.342
Yeah well, if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't have won the game.

37:19.412 --> 37:21.763
Yeah well, you can thank Uncle Sam
for that.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.489
My Uncle Sam.

37:23.647 --> 37:26.810
It's amazing the access a 3-star-General
has to cool toys. And you never know when

37:26.825 --> 37:31.483
a jamming device for Stealth Fighters
will come in handy in a football game!

37:31.565 --> 37:34.389
Because of that jamming device, Mikhail
can't control anyone anymore.

37:34.435 --> 37:35.549
Awesome.

37:35.594 --> 37:40.537
But what I don't understand is how I
miraculously came untied.

37:41.753 --> 37:46.413
And what I don't understand is how you got
sucked into anything besides anonymous tips.

37:46.435 --> 37:51.047
Well, we all have our weaknesses, I guess.

37:51.141 --> 37:53.717
Except for you, of course.

38:09.668 --> 38:14.578
I think you'll find your new accommodations
a lot more comfortable than county lock-up.

38:16.330 --> 38:19.127
And where are you taking me?

38:19.153 --> 38:20.846
Don't worry.

38:24.724 --> 38:27.334
You're going to have a lot of company.

38:27.375 --> 38:30.741
I'm not worried, I have the feeling I
can learn a lot from you, but

38:30.754 --> 38:34.482
I'm just sorry we can't make
good on our agreement.

38:34.499 --> 38:37.098
You underestimate the value of my winnings.

38:37.126 --> 38:40.422
I told you Mr. Luthor,
I've lost my talent.

38:40.423 --> 38:43.185
Mikhail, if there's one thing I've learned

38:43.279 --> 38:46.863
is that anything lost,
can be found again.

38:46.972 --> 38:50.860
If you knew I had a special talent,
then why did you bet against me?

38:50.902 --> 38:52.216
I didn't.

38:52.258 --> 38:54.454
I bet on Clark Kent.

39:09.850 --> 39:12.009
Like I said...

39:12.168 --> 39:14.589
You're not alone.

39:24.482 --> 39:25.958
Lana.

39:26.236 --> 39:29.300
Where's Jason? I've been looking for him,
I actually left him 3 messages.

39:29.324 --> 39:30.898
Yeah I know.

39:30.974 --> 39:35.962
I thought he'd want to know that Metropolis
University offered me a scholarship.

39:36.802 --> 39:38.436
That's great Clark.

39:40.098 --> 39:42.922
One of the scouts he called saw me
in the game.

39:42.956 --> 39:45.137
I wanted to thank him for trusting me.

39:45.140 --> 39:48.628
Well it's too bad that you couldn't
return the favor.

39:48.902 --> 39:51.848
Jason was fired this morning.

40:07.901 --> 40:11.753
It's good to know the local football star
still has time for his friends.

40:11.824 --> 40:13.720
I wouldn't put it like that.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.759
Wild guess.

40:16.784 --> 40:20.818
You're not talking about the
"football star" part.

40:22.061 --> 40:24.324
Maybe I wasn't clear.

40:24.409 --> 40:28.153
But what you and I talk about is
supposed to stay between us.

40:29.197 --> 40:30.989
I see.

40:31.052 --> 40:35.573
So today I'm taking the role of the
despicable untrustworthy friend,

40:35.624 --> 40:39.175
and as usual our hero is making the fatal flaw
of jumping to conclusions.

40:39.215 --> 40:42.816
You're going to tell me you weren't
the one who got Jason fired?

40:42.930 --> 40:47.236
A teacher-student liaison is a taboo
that's pretty hard to come back from.

40:47.308 --> 40:50.353
Oh, you're going to take the moral
high ground on this?

40:50.367 --> 40:54.399
Clark, I'd hate to see Lana's infatuation
earn her a "Scarlet Letter" around town.

40:54.421 --> 40:57.674
Well she has you to thank for that!
Cause you and I were the only two who

40:57.770 --> 41:00.365
knew about it, now everybody's talking.

41:00.798 --> 41:04.128
You didn't do this to protect her.

41:06.451 --> 41:10.495
You know Lana isn't meant to be with Jason.

41:11.455 --> 41:15.675
