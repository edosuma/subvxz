10:20.794 --> 10:22.186
Theissens is dead.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.712
Oh, my God.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.715
What were you two arguing about
at dinner the other night?

10:28.802 --> 10:30.891
'Was it about
his new clothing line?'

10:30.978 --> 10:33.676
I haven't even seen the line.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.722
He wouldn't let anyone see it.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.941
You're about to buy
a line of clothing

10:38.028 --> 10:39.508
you hadn't been allowed
to see?

10:39.595 --> 10:43.294
He's a genius.
You make allowances.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.339
Was he killed?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.689
Stabbed.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.212
That's ugly.

10:48.299 --> 10:50.562
Yes. Did you make allowances
two years ago

10:50.650 --> 10:52.086
when he called you a monster?

10:53.957 --> 10:57.744
Of course.
I took it as a compliment.

10:57.831 --> 11:01.225
I hope I'm a great monster.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.315
Wyck's career
was derailed by Wyck.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.752
Nobody else.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.710
Where were you last night,
Mr. Duval?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.541
Au lit..

11:12.628 --> 11:14.804
...avec ma femme.

11:14.891 --> 11:18.112
I think that means
he was in bed with his wife.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.334
You released Theissens' video,
didn't you?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.990
Yeah? So? It was news.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.950
So you're responsible
for derailing his career.

11:30.037 --> 11:32.692
No. The truth
is what it is.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.302
I was just a conduit.

11:34.389 --> 11:37.348
Yes. A conduit
is what you are.

11:37.435 --> 11:40.308
Why do keep
a conniving backstabber around?

11:40.395 --> 11:42.266
You think you can
really trust him?

11:42.353 --> 11:43.964
You better watch
your mouth, okay?

11:44.051 --> 11:46.749
Or else what? You gonna gossip
about me behind my back?

11:46.836 --> 11:48.795
I'll show you
what I can do, bitch.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.318
- Oh, okay.
- Put the knife down.

11:50.405 --> 11:52.842
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.322
[clatters]

11:54.409 --> 11:56.585
You fashion people...
You're a very, uh..

11:56.672 --> 11:59.370
passionate lot,
aren't you?

11:59.457 --> 12:01.416
These are all the Red John
case files?

12:01.503 --> 12:03.940
Yes, sir. Four boxes
of physical evidence

12:04.027 --> 12:06.029
plus two hard drives
containing all photographic

12:06.116 --> 12:07.901
and documentary evidence.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.512
Okay, good. Um...

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
Sign here.
FBI just called me.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.951
They have somebody en route
coming to pick this up.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.824
But one more thing..
Listen to me very closely.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.869
This is
a highly sensitive issue.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.871
You're not to talk
to anybody about this.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.613
Do you understand?
No one.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.354
Yes, sir.
Whatever you say.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.660
Okay, good. If somebody comes
looking for the files

12:28.748 --> 12:30.097
or asks where they've gone

12:30.184 --> 12:32.490
you're to inform me
immediately.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.144
I cannot stress enough
the importance

12:34.231 --> 12:36.973
that this remain secret.
[knock on door]

12:37.060 --> 12:39.280
J.D.!, Who let you
out of the basement?

12:39.367 --> 12:40.585
Hey to you, Agent Lisbon.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.370
- How you been?
- Alright. How 'bout you?

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you. Back to work.

12:47.418 --> 12:48.724
See ya.

12:48.811 --> 12:51.161
Did I call for you?

12:51.248 --> 12:53.642
I just wanted to apologize
for earlier..

12:53.729 --> 12:56.210
Jane calling to get me out
of the management meeting.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.866
Would it be too much to ask you
to schedule a meeting properly?

12:59.953 --> 13:02.607
I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.960
How's your case going?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.570
It's progressing.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.355
We're gonna interview a suspect
if you'd like to sit in.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.009
Unless you're busy.

13:13.096 --> 13:17.318
Paperwork.
The bane of management.

13:17.405 --> 13:20.408
I'd like you to catch me up
when you have the time.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.671
Of course.
Whenever you want.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.020
Um..

13:24.107 --> 13:26.327
How about 45 minutes
in the bullpen?

13:26.414 --> 13:27.894
Yes, sir.

13:49.132 --> 13:52.657
This is a mistake. I got a
little carried away. That's all.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.095
You threatened my colleague
with a knife.

13:55.182 --> 13:58.663
Mm. And you're also a suspect
in Wyck Theissens' murder.

13:58.750 --> 14:01.362
Me? [chuckles]
Why would I kill him?

14:01.449 --> 14:03.886
Well, you ruined Theissens' life
by releasing that video.

14:03.973 --> 14:07.150
It's only natural that he'd
like to return the favor.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.848
Wh-what are you
talking about?

14:08.935 --> 14:11.372
I'm talking about the fact
that Duval wouldn't be happy

14:11.459 --> 14:14.418
to know what you and his wife
are doing behind his back.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.377
What?

14:16.464 --> 14:18.945
If Theissens learned that
you were cuckolding Duval

14:19.032 --> 14:22.644
then, uh, he has every reason
to reveal that fact

14:22.731 --> 14:24.951
which gives you
every reason to kill him.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.344
You can't say anything
about me and Jacqueline.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.565
If Duval found out,
I'd be done.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.655
I'd never work again.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.744
Where were you last night,
Mr. Acosta?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
I was at the hotel.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.574
Is there anybody
who can verify that?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.448
Okay, listen..

14:44.535 --> 14:46.929
...if I tell you something..

14:47.016 --> 14:50.019
...you wouldn't let anybody know
it was me that told you, right?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.065
- No.
- It depends on what it is.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.980
Well, I wouldn't.
She might.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.721
Okay, well, the thing is

14:56.808 --> 14:59.246
Wyck and Duval did argue
at dinner the other night.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.421
I heard them.

15:00.508 --> 15:01.639
It was about Tony.

15:01.726 --> 15:03.163
Who's Tony?

15:03.250 --> 15:05.600
Tony Redgrave. He's a photog.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.211
Everybody uses him,
but he's kind of a creep.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.430
Hmm.

15:09.517 --> 15:13.086
The thing is,
everybody uses him.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.001
So you can't say
I told you.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.133
I can't afford
to piss him off, alright?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.744
What were they talking about?

15:19.831 --> 15:21.268
Wyck had brought in
some kids

15:21.355 --> 15:23.357
and he was pissed
that Tony was there.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.838
Oh, he was worried that tony
might get creepy with the kids?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.579
You know, Tony--

15:28.666 --> 15:31.060
he likes 'em young,
you know?

15:31.147 --> 15:32.453
Got it.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.455
- Thank you.
- Got it.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.984
- So we go talk to Tony?
- Take somebody with you.

15:42.071 --> 15:45.379
You're not coming? This could be
your ticket out of this job.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.947
Ha! Wainright's coming in.
He wants to check on things.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.863
More managing? I mean, what--
I-- Someone's gotta do it.

15:53.996 --> 15:57.434
So can we bring me up to date
on the Theissens case?

15:57.521 --> 16:00.437
Well, sir, the alibi for
Theissens' assistants hold up.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.526
They were booked
and held overnight.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.919
But the landlord, Liu--

16:04.006 --> 16:05.747
the one that was selling
Theissens' knockoffs--

16:05.834 --> 16:07.183
he disappeared in a hurry.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.707
And we got a court order
to track his phone.

16:09.794 --> 16:13.059
I can make a call, get this at
the top of their list.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.583
If he had a smartphone,
we might be able to

16:15.670 --> 16:17.411
get an exact location
on the GPS.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.240
- Ifhe had his phone on him.
- Well, let's hope.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.372
And we're also looking
into Guy Duval.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.418
Duval was facing
a shareholder revolt.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.508
He had a lot pinned on making
this Theissens deal go through.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.076
- So if Theissens backed out--
- Then Duval would look weak

16:30.163 --> 16:32.078
and that would make
his position look vulnerable.

16:32.165 --> 16:33.905
And he'd do anything to stop
that.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.170
Jane and Van Pelt are looking
into Tony Redgrave.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.476
And what reason would he have
for murdering Theissens?

16:39.563 --> 16:42.827
We don't know. It could just be
Acosta trying to throw us off.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.090
But Redgrave
does have priors.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.569
What for?
[cell phone rings]

16:45.656 --> 16:49.834
Providing drugs
and alcohol to minors.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.881
um, you, uh, you definitely have
your work cut out for you...

16:52.968 --> 16:56.232
so I will leave you to it.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.191
Excellent.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.281
This is Wainright.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.501
Hey. I just want to acknowledge
receipt of the Red John files.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.937
Thank you for that.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.375
Sure. Yeah.
Anything I can do to help.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.681
Listen, I am assuming
we're on the same page

17:10.768 --> 17:13.336
but you didn't tell your people
about this, did you?

17:13.423 --> 17:14.946
No. I saw no need.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.819
'I agree. Thanks.'

17:22.737 --> 17:23.868
[knocks on door]

17:23.955 --> 17:25.131
Baris Acar?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.176
Ah. Yes, ma'am.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.396
Susan Darcy, FBI.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.050
Uh, did I do
something wrong?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.878
No, it's nothing like that.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.707
I've never been interviewed
by the FBI before.

17:36.794 --> 17:41.321
Mr. Acar, this is
your signature, isn't it?

17:41.408 --> 17:42.974
Yes, ma'am, it is.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.542
And this is a form telling me
that Patrick Jane

17:45.629 --> 17:48.676
brought a visitor here to see
the body of Timothy Carter.

17:48.763 --> 17:52.549
Mr. Jane shot and killed him
in a mall food court.

17:52.636 --> 17:53.811
Do you remember that visit?

17:53.898 --> 17:55.639
Uh, I sure do.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.643
Can you tell me about it?

17:59.730 --> 18:02.733
Well, it stuck in my head
because it was kind of weird.

18:02.820 --> 18:04.344
Weird? What do you mean?

18:04.431 --> 18:05.867
She was blind.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.087
That's kind of weird, right?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.306
Mr. Jane's guest
was a blind woman?

18:10.393 --> 18:12.352
I couldn't figure out
why he brought her.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.701
I mean, she was blind.

18:16.834 --> 18:20.273
Thank you, Mr. Acar.
That's all.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.796
Oh, Mr. Acar

18:21.883 --> 18:24.581
you do know not to speak
to anyone about this?

18:24.668 --> 18:25.843
Whatever you say, ma'am.

18:39.901 --> 18:42.599
Uh, excuse me.
Is that, uh, Tony Redgrave?

18:42.686 --> 18:45.994
Sasha, Sasha, Sasha..

18:46.081 --> 18:48.692
I'm an artist, yeah?
Not a fishmonger.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.651
God sakes, relax.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.088
How am I supposed to relax?

18:53.175 --> 18:54.785
Tony, you're so bloody selfish.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.962
Wyck is dead. He's dead.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.574
Circle of life, babe,
circle of life.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.272
Alright.
Let's try a couple more.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.535
That sullen, grieving look...

19:05.622 --> 19:07.233
I like it.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.843
You Tony?

19:08.930 --> 19:11.411
I'm agent Van Pelt.
This is Patrick Jane

19:11.498 --> 19:13.891
from the California Bureau
of Investigation.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.416
Oh, my God. I love you.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.157
Take your clothes off.
Both of you.

19:20.985 --> 19:24.337
I'm just kidding.
look at your face.

19:24.424 --> 19:27.166
We're here about Wyck Theissens.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.559
It's really sad, right?
Really sad.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.605
I was about to shoot
his comeback campaign.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.260
What a huge bummer that was.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.001
Stabbed to death, right?

19:37.088 --> 19:40.004
What with? A knife? Razor?

19:40.091 --> 19:42.659
Shut up! Tony, God!

19:42.746 --> 19:44.531
We were like family.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.663
We came up together,
me and Wyck.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.100
I walked in every single one
of his shows.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.407
[clicks]
Yes!

19:51.494 --> 19:53.017
That's it, Sasha.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.497
Now you're killing it.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.847
Where were you last night,
Mr. Redgrave?

19:56.934 --> 19:59.198
Oh, uh..

19:59.285 --> 20:01.069
Let's see..

20:01.156 --> 20:04.464
I was... downstairs..

20:04.551 --> 20:08.424
at the pool for a little bit.
Then some drinks at the bar

20:08.511 --> 20:10.948
then dinner,
then we came up here.

20:11.035 --> 20:14.038
Who's "we"?

20:14.125 --> 20:16.824
I don't know. Everyone.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.870
You came up here for a bit,
didn't you, darling?

20:19.957 --> 20:22.046
Yes, you were.
Chin up.

20:22.133 --> 20:26.181
It's quite the act, this, uh,
wide-eyed man-child bit.

20:26.268 --> 20:30.664
Nobody ever calls you
on it, do they?

20:30.751 --> 20:33.275
I'm just really lucky,
you know?

20:33.362 --> 20:37.148
It's just about living
in the moment. Having some fun.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.761
Ah, yes. The joys
of living in the moment.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.937
All fun and games
till someone gets hurt.

20:43.024 --> 20:44.939
How old are these kids?

20:45.026 --> 20:47.115
Everyone in here's an adult.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.725
They're here
because they wanna be.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.380
Nobody's making anyone do
anything they don't wanna do.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.469
- You got it?
- Loud and clear.

20:53.556 --> 20:57.168
Did you make sure
Theissens got it, too?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.388
Don't think you're gonna
put anything on me.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.998
I didn't do
anything to Wyck.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.783
You get to do
whatever you want

21:02.870 --> 21:05.002
'cause no one cares enough
to challenge it.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.048
But Theissens--
he didn't approve, did he?

21:07.135 --> 21:09.920
If he thought you were messing
with those kids of his

21:10.007 --> 21:11.705
he'd have happily
sent you to jail.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.142
You've got it
so twisted, man.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.797
Wyck was refusing to do
anything with any of us.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.233
That's what I heard.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.540
But Duval said
it wasn't a problem.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.542
He said he'd fix it.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.285
Don't leave town without talking
to us first, okay?

21:33.422 --> 21:35.381
I could see Redgrave
murdering Theissens

21:35.468 --> 21:37.948
if he was afraid
to go to jail.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.994
Jane went to talk to Theissens'
assistants again.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.604
Maybe they'll give us something.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.650
Then again, if what
Redgrave says is true

21:43.737 --> 21:45.129
Duval could be our killer.

21:45.216 --> 21:47.349
Stay there. Watch the lobby.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.656
Will do.
Any sign of Mr. Liu?

21:49.743 --> 21:52.441
A GPS on Liu's phone points
to a warehouse in Oakland.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.748
Cho and Rigsby
are checking it out now.

21:54.835 --> 22:00.667
Okay.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.799
Yeah. I'll call you later.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.672
Okay. Me, too.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.456
Sorry. Sarah.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.284
According to GPS,
he's in there.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.373
Okay. Let's go.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.635
Everything okay?

22:12.722 --> 22:17.161
Yeah.
I mean, it's complicated.

22:17.248 --> 22:19.642
Sarah's pregnant.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.427
Oh.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.950
Congratulations.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.300
Thanks.
It's exciting, right?

22:25.387 --> 22:27.781
Yeah. I'm excited.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.348
[clatter]

22:40.794 --> 22:42.665
[Cho]
'Mr. Liu!
This is the CBI!'

22:42.752 --> 22:46.539
Nobody move!
Hands where we can see 'em.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.714
[coughs]

22:47.801 --> 22:49.629
[panting]

22:51.892 --> 22:54.111
There--there's no problem
here, sirs.

22:54.198 --> 22:57.376
We're all friends.
[panting]

22:57.463 --> 22:59.160
[coughs]
'No problem.'

22:59.247 --> 23:02.163
You can go. No problem.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.425
[laughs]
No problem.

23:23.750 --> 23:25.186
Yes? Can I help you?

23:25.273 --> 23:26.492
Rosalind Harker?

23:26.579 --> 23:28.189
Yes. Who is it?

23:28.276 --> 23:30.409
I'm Susan Darcy.
I'm with the FBI.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.761
May I come in?

23:34.848 --> 23:36.415
Sure.

23:42.159 --> 23:43.857
Miss Harker,
you recently paid a visit

23:43.944 --> 23:45.772
to the Sacramento County
Morgue.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.904
Yes.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.515
Did I do something wrong?
That's--

23:49.602 --> 23:51.168
No, it was nothing like that

23:51.255 --> 23:53.910
I just was wondering what
the purpose of your visit was.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.738
Oh.

23:55.825 --> 24:00.917
Well, Patrick Jane wanted me to
check if a man who was in there

24:01.004 --> 24:03.572
was my friend,
Roy Taglioferro.

24:03.659 --> 24:07.010
Roy Taglioferro,
also known as Red John?

24:07.097 --> 24:09.709
Mm. Well..

24:09.796 --> 24:13.452
that's what I've been told
by the authorities, yes.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.497
I suppose it must be true

24:15.584 --> 24:19.370
but I... still
can't quite believe it.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.503
I understand.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.723
So was it Taglioferro
in the morgue?

24:23.810 --> 24:26.552
No. It wasn't Roy.

24:30.643 --> 24:34.037
Well, thank you.
I appreciate your time.

24:34.124 --> 24:37.432
No, please, don't get up.
I'll see myself out.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.479
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.310
What's your connection
to Liu?

24:46.397 --> 24:49.575
What went down
at the warehouse?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.273
No English.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.188
Lawyer.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.501
They can lawyer up
all they want.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.155
All we need
is for you to testify.

25:05.242 --> 25:08.115
Dream on, lady.
I testify to nothing.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.334
You don't know these guys.

25:10.421 --> 25:13.163
So tell me about them.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.123
I import and export
to China, understand?

25:16.210 --> 25:20.127
I deal in electronics,
fashion, luxury goods.

25:20.214 --> 25:23.826
In my business, there are always
gangsters who need paying off.

25:23.913 --> 25:27.134
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Macau--
everywhere the same.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.701
What are they doing here?

25:28.788 --> 25:32.269
I told 'em I had no more
high-fashion copies for them.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.141
They came to change my mind.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.186
So you think they went
to Theissens first

25:36.273 --> 25:38.188
- to send a message to you?
- Maybe.

25:38.275 --> 25:40.713
If so, forget about it.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.497
You can't touch them.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.325
- Really?
- Really.

25:44.412 --> 25:46.283
Like MC Hammer.

25:54.204 --> 25:56.250
Yeah, we hung out with Redgrave.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.165
Dude knows how to party.

25:58.252 --> 26:00.210
Theissens didn't like him
much, though, did he?

26:00.297 --> 26:02.996
Wyck? Wyck hated Redgrave.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.260
He represented everything that
was wrong in the fashion world,

26:06.347 --> 26:08.349
in Wyck's opinion.

26:08.436 --> 26:10.090
And he wouldn't have wanted you

26:10.177 --> 26:11.613
to spend time with Redgrave,
then?

26:11.700 --> 26:12.745
[chuckles]

26:12.832 --> 26:14.355
Are you kidding?

26:14.442 --> 26:16.052
He would have freaked.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.967
He was real protective of us.

26:18.054 --> 26:21.710
But come on. You gotta
cut loose sometimes.

26:21.797 --> 26:24.147
Hmm. I take it you three

26:24.234 --> 26:26.759
are still planning
to put the show on anyway?

26:26.846 --> 26:29.936
Yeah. We wanna do it
for Wyck.

26:30.023 --> 26:31.241
He gave us a chance.

26:31.328 --> 26:33.287
He taught us everything
we needed to know

26:33.374 --> 26:36.377
and we are gonna prove
to the world what he could do.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.597
Yeah, he treated us
with love and respect.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.468
We wanna honor him
the same way.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.646
Mm.

26:44.733 --> 26:49.564
Well, I particularly like this,
uh... gold feathery number.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.871
It's just so, uh...

26:51.958 --> 26:54.177
Well, it's an event.

26:54.264 --> 26:57.311
Uh, where'd you get
all these gold feathers?

26:57.398 --> 26:59.182
We dyed them.

26:59.269 --> 27:02.359
Combination of henna
and iron oxide or something.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.100
Tristan was gonna model it

27:04.187 --> 27:07.234
and Wyck was gonna
close the show with it.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.497
Do you have any more
of those feathers?

27:09.584 --> 27:11.978
I guess so... if you want.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.427
Why the long faces?

27:26.514 --> 27:28.734
You see those two over there
talking to Wainright?

27:28.821 --> 27:31.650
The one with the red tie
looks like state department.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.173
He is.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.262
The other one's from
the Chinese embassy.

27:35.349 --> 27:37.394
Apparently the three
that were intimidating Liu

27:37.481 --> 27:38.613
have diplomatic immunity.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.180
Wainright's cutting 'em loose.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.139
Well, I'd best go
talk to them right away.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.967
Agent Darcy. Hi.

27:45.054 --> 27:48.188
I need to talk
to you, please. May I ?

27:48.275 --> 27:49.493
[both]
Of course.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.234
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.846
I just need to do one thing.
Where are those gangsters?

27:53.933 --> 27:56.631
In the interrogation room
with their lawyer.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.677
- Come on.
- Thanks.

28:04.639 --> 28:06.902
This won't take a minute.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.101
What was that all about?

28:32.188 --> 28:34.669
-Just trying to solve a murder.

28:34.756 --> 28:35.888
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.672
I just have
a couple of questions

28:37.759 --> 28:39.805
I need you to clarify for me.

28:39.892 --> 28:42.764
Oh. Fire away.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.810
[water running]

28:44.897 --> 28:47.421
Rosalind Harker.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.729
You met her a couple of
years ago

28:50.816 --> 28:52.252
when you were
tracking Red John?

28:52.339 --> 28:54.297
Uh, yes.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.865
That's correct.

28:56.952 --> 28:58.562
Why do you ask?

28:58.649 --> 29:00.434
She was the lover of a man--

29:00.521 --> 29:02.566
Roy Taglioferro?

29:02.653 --> 29:04.351
Right. Who was really
Red John?

29:04.438 --> 29:06.701
Yes.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.485
But you took Rosalind
to the morgue

29:08.572 --> 29:10.531
to look at the body
of Timothy Carter--

29:10.618 --> 29:13.055
Timothy Carter, who you killed
because hewas Red John.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.796
Yes.

29:16.929 --> 29:18.713
Rosalind told you
that Timothy Carter

29:18.800 --> 29:20.584
wasn't Taglioferro,
didn't she?

29:20.671 --> 29:23.587
Yes. I was hoping
for confirmation from her.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.851
She's hardly
a rock-solid witness.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.157
It had been many years
since her last contact

29:28.244 --> 29:30.029
with Mr. Taglioferro.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.509
She's kind of a lonely soul.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.859
I think she'd rather believe

29:33.946 --> 29:36.165
he was still out there
alive somewhere.

29:36.252 --> 29:39.125
Hmm.

29:39.212 --> 29:41.127
I suppose you're right.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.216
It was Red John
that I killed.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.436
I sure hope so.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.660
Thanks, Patrick.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.531
Pleasure.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.804
I checked out the Chinese thugs.
They're clean.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.631
Let's go to the hotel,
shall we?

30:07.718 --> 30:09.764
Uh, aside from the kids
helping Theissens

30:09.851 --> 30:11.853
only the killer
knows what this is.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.550
I'll tell Rigsby and Van Pelt.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.599
Tell me what happened
with Darcy.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.514
I know it was something.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.298
Well, it's nothing important.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.258
It's bad news.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.738
You've got a bad news expression
on your face.

30:29.392 --> 30:32.221
Darcy talked
to Rosalind Harker.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.615
She knows Timothy Carter
wasn't Red John.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.139
Well, she might suspect,
but she doesn't know.

30:37.226 --> 30:38.880
And you're not
gonna tell her?

30:38.967 --> 30:42.101
Well, of course not.
Why stir up trouble?

30:44.712 --> 30:45.800
Hmm?

30:47.367 --> 30:48.629
Let's go.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.640
Hey, we're headed over
to the hotel.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.468
You on top
of everything here?

31:01.555 --> 31:02.904
Hmm?

31:02.991 --> 31:05.646
Oh, yeah.
Sure.

31:07.735 --> 31:10.999
Wayne?
You're reading a baby book.

31:11.086 --> 31:13.784
Um, yeah, I am.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.526
Um, why?

31:16.613 --> 31:18.224
I...

31:18.311 --> 31:19.225
Yes.

31:20.791 --> 31:23.055
I'm pregnant.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.404
Sarah's pregnant.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.886
- I'm having a baby.
- Oh, my god.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.279
Yikes.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.194
I mean...
Sorry.

31:32.281 --> 31:34.805
It surprised me.
Congratulations.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.460
No, it was a surprise
to me, too.

31:37.547 --> 31:39.375
Still is, actually.

31:39.462 --> 31:43.031
Hard even for me
to believe sometimes.

31:43.118 --> 31:44.685
Are you okay?

31:44.772 --> 31:47.818
Yeah. Oh, I'm--
babies are good, right?

31:49.342 --> 31:50.691
Always wanted to have kids.

31:50.778 --> 31:54.608
Just a little earlier
than I expected.

31:54.695 --> 31:56.392
So are you and Sarah
getting married?

31:56.479 --> 31:59.004
Oh, no. No.
Nothing like that.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.920
Don't wanna rush
into anything, right?

32:03.573 --> 32:06.141
Haven't even been dating
that long.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.538
If... you need anything,
you can ask.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.235
You know that, right?

32:13.322 --> 32:16.804
Yeah.
You should get going, though.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.371
Yeah.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.985
Uh, Wayne..

32:24.072 --> 32:26.683
The kid's lucky.
You're gonna make a great dad.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.511
Yeah? You think?

32:28.598 --> 32:31.340
Yeah. I know it.

32:31.427 --> 32:32.689
Bye.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.086
Thanks.

32:41.350 --> 32:44.223
[indistinct conversations]

32:48.575 --> 32:50.055
Mr. Duval. Hi.

32:50.142 --> 32:52.709
We just need to clear
a few things up.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.189
This is approaching harassment.

32:54.276 --> 32:55.799
We have spoken
to our lawyers.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.236
- Come with me, please.
- Why?

32:57.323 --> 32:59.542
I have a question
I'd like to ask you.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.240
What kind of question?

33:01.327 --> 33:03.764
It's the kind of question
that could clear your name

33:03.851 --> 33:06.201
or prove your guilt.
But, uh, first of all

33:06.288 --> 33:10.684
I'd like you to
empty your pockets, please.

33:10.771 --> 33:11.902
This is ridiculous.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.121
Please.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.820
[sighs]

33:23.218 --> 33:24.654
what is this?

33:27.744 --> 33:29.877
What does it look like?

33:29.964 --> 33:33.141
Well, it's obviously a feather.
It's not mine.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.927
Where did this come from?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.929
Lisbon,
our work here is done.

33:39.017 --> 33:43.369
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Duval. Mrs. Duval.

33:43.456 --> 33:46.676
[both speaking French]

33:57.252 --> 33:59.385
- Hey, Junior.
- Hey. What's up?

33:59.472 --> 34:01.256
How's your investigation going?

34:01.343 --> 34:04.564
Well, that's why we're here.
I found the killer.

34:04.651 --> 34:05.956
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.871
Well, who is it?
What happened?

34:09.873 --> 34:12.485
The clue was right
in front of my eyes.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.401
It's all here
in this magazine.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.925
Whoa.

34:18.012 --> 34:21.972
That's... pretty cool.
Is it yours?

34:22.799 --> 34:25.846
Hmm.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.153
Hey, what article
am I supposed to be reading?

34:28.240 --> 34:30.894
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Acosta. We'll stay in touch.

34:35.334 --> 34:36.987
Yes. I love that.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.554
[knock on door]

34:38.641 --> 34:40.382
Don't move a muscle.

34:43.472 --> 34:44.386
Yes?

34:44.473 --> 34:46.258
Hello.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.390
Hi. I'm agent Teresa Lisbon.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.218
You've already met
Patrick Jane, right?

34:50.305 --> 34:51.872
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:51.959 --> 34:54.179
What do you want?
You come to hassle me

34:54.266 --> 34:56.529
about Wyck Theissens' death
some more, have you?

34:56.616 --> 34:59.097
Not really. One or two more
things falling into place

34:59.184 --> 35:00.620
and the killer
shall be revealed.

35:00.707 --> 35:01.882
[knock on door]

35:01.969 --> 35:02.970
I'll get it.

35:05.538 --> 35:08.628
So why have you come here?

35:08.715 --> 35:13.372
I need your help.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.765
hey. I didn't order
room service.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.071
Where did that come from?

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
Oh, all I know
is that I'm starving.

35:19.204 --> 35:22.163
Do you think I could, uh,
have something from here?

35:26.863 --> 35:28.822
What the hell is that?

35:28.909 --> 35:32.304
It means nothing to you?

35:32.391 --> 35:34.262
Why would it?

35:40.877 --> 35:42.966
You.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.231
Ma'am!

35:47.580 --> 35:49.364
Ma'am! Stop!

35:49.451 --> 35:51.279
I got her.

35:51.366 --> 35:53.890
You're under arrest.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.414
You're losing your touch.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.937
You didn't know it was her.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.199
Don't be ridiculous.

35:58.286 --> 36:00.549
The trick worked
exactly as I intended.

36:00.636 --> 36:03.204
It didn't matter which one
I thought it was.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.076
That's how
a good trick works.

36:06.164 --> 36:09.341
You wouldsay that,
wouldn't you?

36:09.428 --> 36:11.865
[clicks]

36:21.788 --> 36:24.356
We've got your fingerprints
on the murder weapon, Sasha.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.923
It's a perfect match.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.360
Tell me what happened.

36:30.753 --> 36:33.234
It was supposed to be me.

36:33.321 --> 36:37.107
I was supposed to be the face
of Wyck's return.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.720
Because you had been
his inspiration before?

36:40.807 --> 36:43.810
That's right.
I was his muse.

36:43.897 --> 36:46.073
So you went to talk to him
that night?

36:46.160 --> 36:48.684
Mm-hmm.

36:48.771 --> 36:52.035
He was nice, but distant.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.950
I wanted to see the clothes

36:54.037 --> 36:56.562
and he didn't want
to show me them.

36:56.649 --> 36:59.260
I should've known then.

36:59.347 --> 37:01.828
'I told him
they were all beautiful.'

37:01.915 --> 37:04.700
'But there was
this golden feather dress'

37:04.787 --> 37:06.528
'that just hooked me.'

37:06.615 --> 37:08.443
'And that's when he told me.'

37:08.530 --> 37:12.447
'He told me he had found
someone new and fresh.'

37:12.534 --> 37:14.884
'Some little bitch
named Tristan.'

37:14.971 --> 37:18.192
'He told me I was too old.'

37:18.279 --> 37:21.195
'You must have felt
angry, betrayed, even.'

37:21.282 --> 37:23.719
'How could he think he could
treat me like that?'

37:23.806 --> 37:27.201
'So I wanted
to make him suffer.'

37:27.288 --> 37:30.509
'I wanted to make him
eat those words.'

37:34.426 --> 37:36.645
So am I gonna be
outta here soon?

37:36.732 --> 37:38.691
I have a show
in a couple hours

37:38.778 --> 37:42.347
and I need to get there early
for makeup and fitting.

37:42.434 --> 37:43.348
No.

37:45.306 --> 37:48.178
You're not going
to be in the show.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.267
No more shows.

37:49.354 --> 37:53.967
[cell phone rings]

37:54.054 --> 37:55.925
Hello? This is Patrick.

37:56.012 --> 38:00.321
[Rosalind]
'This is Rosalind Harker.
Roy came to see me.'

38:02.802 --> 38:04.673
Is he still there, Rosalind?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.502
'Yes, Roy's here.'

38:07.589 --> 38:10.244
Like I thought, it's all
a big misunderstanding.

38:10.331 --> 38:13.769
He says to tell you
and that Darcy woman

38:13.856 --> 38:15.554
he's going
to clear it all up.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.774
Okay.
Uh, and you're at home?

38:18.861 --> 38:20.950
[laughs]
Where else would I be?

38:21.037 --> 38:23.083
And you're okay?

38:23.170 --> 38:24.737
Of course I am.

38:24.824 --> 38:27.566
Okay. I-I'm on my way.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.221
I want teams around back.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.398
Set up a perimeter.
Nobody in or out.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.008
[piano music]

39:19.879 --> 39:24.013
Rosalind. Where's Roy?

39:24.100 --> 39:26.102
Roy couldn't stay.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.410
Jane

39:29.497 --> 39:32.370
[music continues]

39:57.090 --> 39:59.309
It's the morgue attendant.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.015
You still gonna try
and tell me Red John is dead?

40:13.628 --> 40:16.109
[music continues]
