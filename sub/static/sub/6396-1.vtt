02:12.198 --> 02:14.132
You don't mess with the Zohan!

02:32.152 --> 02:33.244
Come disco.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.649
No, no, no.
I no disco, I make the fish.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.483
Danny, come on, go disco.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.820
Oh, okay. Disco!

02:41.294 --> 02:44.457
Danny, that looks good. You're gonna
be a hit at your bar mitzvah.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.598
<i>So okay, Mr. Big Penachim,
I no see you disco.</i>

02:49.769 --> 02:51.600
<i>No, no, no. I making dagim.
I no disco.</i>

02:51.771 --> 02:54.740
<i>A real man, he can disco
and cooking dagim.</i>

02:54.908 --> 02:56.000
So let's go.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.247
Go, go.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.580
I get the hummus for you.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.150
And for you.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.955
Little for me, eh!

03:18.998 --> 03:20.022
No.

03:23.136 --> 03:24.296
No.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.335
<i>Kapara, what is going on!</i>

03:26.506 --> 03:28.804
<i>Just some bullshit-uchen.</i>

03:29.842 --> 03:30.866
Let's go!

03:31.044 --> 03:34.980
Hey, I'm on vacation here.
Can't you see this!

03:35.148 --> 03:39.050
You promised me time off.
Get someone else to do it.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.517
Are they gonna hurt him!

03:45.692 --> 03:47.819
No one can hurt the Zohan.

03:50.163 --> 03:54.497
- Bye, Zohan.
- Take care, man.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.521
The terrorist known as Phantom...

04:15.687 --> 04:18.815
...was spotted yesterday at a
Hacky Sack tournament in Beirut.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.927
He may be have been trying to
bait us by surfacing briefly.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.501
We believe he's being kept in a safe
house on the Lebanon border.

04:31.669 --> 04:33.000
How is we lose Phantom!

04:33.171 --> 04:35.571
Didn't I capture Phantom
three months ago!

04:35.740 --> 04:37.765
What, you didn't hear
about the trade!

04:37.942 --> 04:39.068
What trade!

04:41.913 --> 04:43.847
Zohan, we gave back the Phantom.

04:44.015 --> 04:46.415
No!

04:46.584 --> 04:48.950
What do you mean,
we give back the Phantom!

04:49.120 --> 04:50.553
Zohan, relax.

04:50.722 --> 04:53.953
It was a good trade.
We got back Etan and David.

04:54.125 --> 04:56.889
That's all we got
for a veteran terrorist!

04:57.061 --> 04:59.586
Come on, we got hosed here.

04:59.764 --> 05:01.891
They threw in a spy
to be named later.

05:02.066 --> 05:04.193
Come on, Zohan,
you have to like that deal.

05:04.369 --> 05:06.132
Maybe they're talking about Ze'ev.

05:06.304 --> 05:08.738
Ze'ev.
Come on, he's not even a good spy.

05:08.906 --> 05:12.034
He got caught, for God's sake.
He's a stupid.

05:12.210 --> 05:16.408
Our plan is to enter the building from
the front with a team of eight men...

05:16.581 --> 05:19.277
...with an additional 12 men
at perimeter positions.

05:19.450 --> 05:23.284
Unfortunately, there is a high
probability of collateral damage...

05:23.454 --> 05:27.049
...including property and loss of life,
on both sides.

05:27.225 --> 05:28.783
Okay, here we go.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.154
Excuse me!

05:30.328 --> 05:33.627
Come on, is it not safer
to send one man into building...

05:33.798 --> 05:36.062
...with minimal coverage
to take out the target...

05:36.234 --> 05:38.429
...instead of blowing up
half the neighborhood!

05:38.603 --> 05:39.968
Well, who would do that!

05:40.138 --> 05:41.503
Oh, "who would do that!"

05:41.673 --> 05:43.971
You know you were
going to ask the Zohan.

05:44.142 --> 05:45.336
Zohan, why you say this!

05:45.510 --> 05:48.673
I just laid out an entire plan
which didn't rely on you.

05:48.846 --> 05:51.007
Come on, Yaron,
you're setting me up.

05:51.182 --> 05:54.948
All this talk of civilian casualties,
then of course I end up doing it.

05:55.119 --> 05:58.247
- But I'm not even asking you to do it.
- All right, I'll do it.

05:58.423 --> 06:02.189
Give me Avi and Koby as watch,
I'll get it done without the mess.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.988
Well, thank you. You didn't have to.

06:05.163 --> 06:07.529
<i>Oh, I didn't have to, bullschlassah.</i>

06:08.366 --> 06:09.856
Have some Fizzy Bubblech.

06:10.902 --> 06:14.303
"Kiwi watermelon"! Yeah, is good.

06:57.081 --> 06:59.709
"Avalon."

07:18.469 --> 07:20.266
Chunky cuts.

07:21.672 --> 07:23.765
Zohan, what are you doing!
The girls are here.

07:23.941 --> 07:25.772
I know, I was watching television.

07:25.943 --> 07:28.741
Well, if you want to have fun with us,
we're right next door.

07:28.913 --> 07:31.609
- Good with the sticky, you should do it.
- No, no, no.

07:31.783 --> 07:34.616
I am going to dinner with my parents.
Just leave me alone.

07:34.786 --> 07:38.085
- All right, all right.
- It is all right!

07:39.390 --> 07:41.085
You don't giggle at the Zohan.

07:41.259 --> 07:44.023
You hear me!
No giggling at the Zohan.

07:44.195 --> 07:46.595
You never giggle at the Zohan.

07:51.469 --> 07:52.766
<i>What's the matter, tatele?</i>

07:52.937 --> 07:55.770
You haven't touched
your baba ganoush.

07:58.209 --> 08:00.973
What would you think if I tell you...

08:01.145 --> 08:03.443
...I want to leaving the army,
start a new life!

08:03.915 --> 08:08.978
Why would you do that!
You are good at it. It's steady pay.

08:09.153 --> 08:11.144
You can't leave,
you're one of their best.

08:11.322 --> 08:13.449
Besides, you are too old
to take a risk.

08:13.624 --> 08:17.060
Stay in the army, play it safe.

08:17.228 --> 08:19.924
There's other things I can do
besides war.

08:20.097 --> 08:21.564
You don't war.

08:21.732 --> 08:24.326
- I was in the real war.
- I know, I know the story.

08:24.502 --> 08:26.663
1967.

08:26.838 --> 08:30.672
We were surrounded on all sides,
outnumbered.

08:30.842 --> 08:33.072
- And in six days, we...
- And in six days, we won.

08:33.244 --> 08:35.871
You won. I'm sorry,
I don't have a big, fancy war...

08:36.047 --> 08:37.639
...that lasted all of six days...

08:37.815 --> 08:42.946
Six days and five hours.
Your generation likes to forget that.

08:45.156 --> 08:48.717
Dad, I've done so much
for the country. When does it end!

08:48.893 --> 08:52.329
They've been fighting for 2000 years.
It can't be much longer.

08:53.664 --> 08:57.122
All of my friends served
the minimum three years.

08:57.301 --> 08:59.826
Why can't I move on!
Do something else.

09:00.004 --> 09:02.370
Something more creative.

09:02.540 --> 09:04.201
Creative, what!

09:04.375 --> 09:07.208
You've caught so many terrorists,
it's an art.

09:07.378 --> 09:09.812
You're like Rembrandt
with a grenade.

09:09.981 --> 09:11.039
What will you do!

09:12.783 --> 09:14.444
Maybe go to America.

09:14.619 --> 09:17.486
What, and haggle over
stereo equipment!

09:17.655 --> 09:19.452
Wait a minute, Ya'acov.

09:19.624 --> 09:22.286
Uncle Levi will set you up
at electronic store.

09:22.460 --> 09:25.987
You make money, sow your
creative oats, you come back.

09:26.163 --> 09:28.893
No, I don't want to do
electronics store.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.160
Then how will you make money!

09:32.770 --> 09:34.169
I don't want to say.

09:34.338 --> 09:38.502
Zohan, if you can't tell your parents,
who can you tell!

09:38.676 --> 09:40.974
Come, Zohanele.

09:44.515 --> 09:47.916
I want to cut...

09:48.085 --> 09:51.054
...and style hair.

09:58.162 --> 10:00.562
<i>You... You fagala?</i>

10:00.731 --> 10:02.858
<i>He's fag... Faga...</i>

10:06.337 --> 10:09.465
I like hair. It's pleasant,
it's peaceful, no one gets hurt.

10:09.640 --> 10:14.270
<i>Well, you're only digging
that fagala hole deeper and deeper.</i>

10:15.613 --> 10:19.845
<i>Hello, down there!
Hello, in the fagala hole.</i>

10:20.885 --> 10:22.546
Maybe he wants Vaseline.

10:24.388 --> 10:27.084
Yes, it's so funny.

10:55.152 --> 11:02.149
I just want to make people
silky smooth.

11:11.669 --> 11:14.900
You know the Phantom will try to run,
so be ready for this.

11:15.072 --> 11:16.733
- Zohan, now!
- So let's go.

11:34.892 --> 11:36.086
The Zohan.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.337
Freeze!

11:59.150 --> 12:04.486
I get it, I get it,
you guys don't like our country.

12:11.695 --> 12:12.957
So we are the bad ones.

12:13.130 --> 12:16.293
I'd love to sit and discuss this
with you, but I'm short on time.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.560
I'm just saying.
It's not so cut-and-dry.

12:20.971 --> 12:23.166
We settled here
for hundreds of years!

12:23.340 --> 12:24.500
Good point.

12:24.675 --> 12:28.133
None of my ancestors ever stepped
foot in this land. No, you're right.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.246
Hey, don't walk away!

12:31.348 --> 12:33.816
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

12:33.984 --> 12:35.918
Hello, jackass.

12:38.923 --> 12:42.859
You think you can oppress my people,
landgrabber!

12:43.427 --> 12:46.658
But I will never disappear.

12:46.831 --> 12:49.891
No one can catch Phantom!

12:57.708 --> 12:59.107
So let's go.

13:15.426 --> 13:16.791
Very good.

13:47.591 --> 13:49.491
Sorry. It's for the cause.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.240
Zohan.

14:08.946 --> 14:12.109
Zohan, bring it.

14:27.464 --> 14:29.261
Why you do this! I feel no pain.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.800
No, no, no. I feel no pain.

14:32.970 --> 14:36.428
- I feel no pain. This is too much...
- No, no, no. I feel no pain.

14:36.607 --> 14:38.165
I have told you in other fights.

14:38.342 --> 14:40.833
No, no, no. I kill you right now.

14:46.183 --> 14:48.151
Look, look, look.

14:51.989 --> 14:55.425
The piranha,
it looks very painful for you.

14:55.593 --> 14:57.356
Is good, is good.

14:57.528 --> 14:59.621
Is very nice. Yes, yes.

14:59.797 --> 15:01.992
Fizzy Bubblech for me.

15:06.770 --> 15:08.135
You like what you see!

15:11.342 --> 15:12.468
Time to die.

15:12.643 --> 15:14.167
So let's go.

15:24.021 --> 15:26.546
Okay, game over.

15:45.976 --> 15:47.409
Yeah!

15:49.280 --> 15:50.770
I kill!

15:51.315 --> 15:54.250
I kill the Zohan!

15:55.019 --> 15:56.077
Zohan is dead.

15:59.923 --> 16:02.050
The Phantom!

16:33.857 --> 16:36.985
Cutting the hair,
this makes something beautiful.

16:37.161 --> 16:39.152
Instead of shooting it.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.423
That's why I had to fake to die.

16:41.598 --> 16:45.227
I could have captured Phantom again,
but for what! They trade him.

16:46.170 --> 16:49.469
I love my country,
but the fighting, it never ends.

16:50.441 --> 16:52.909
It's like Mr. Scrappy, you bite Coco.

16:53.077 --> 16:54.476
Coco, you bite him back.

16:54.645 --> 16:58.809
<i>Soon you are both having worms,
eating your own poopech...</i>

17:02.853 --> 17:04.047
I understand. The pills.

17:04.221 --> 17:06.781
Your parents think
they know what's best for you.

17:06.957 --> 17:08.617
Sleep.

17:15.898 --> 17:18.696
It's all about not getting recognized.

17:18.868 --> 17:20.803
I know how great I looked
in the beard...

17:20.971 --> 17:23.804
but I'll make this work for me,
you'll see.

17:38.222 --> 17:41.487
Rise and shine, guys.
Good morning.

17:42.126 --> 17:43.718
Is nice, huh!

17:43.894 --> 17:45.327
It's the Avalon.

17:45.496 --> 17:49.660
It says I care about the way I look,
but I'm still approachable.

17:51.402 --> 17:53.199
Oh, you like this!

17:53.370 --> 17:56.464
Who wants to go next, guys!
Who wants to look silky smooth!

17:56.640 --> 17:58.699
Yes. Yes.

18:03.013 --> 18:06.039
Oh, where are my two little babies!
Oh, come on.

18:06.216 --> 18:09.344
Come on out, Scrappy, come on out.
Come to Mama, Mr. Coco.

18:10.454 --> 18:14.049
Mr. Scrappy. Coco.
What happened!

18:14.224 --> 18:16.249
Who gave you permission
to do this, huh!

18:16.427 --> 18:18.019
Who did! Answer me.

18:18.195 --> 18:20.254
Scrappy, was it you!
It was you, wasn't it!

18:20.431 --> 18:22.160
You're always the instigator.

18:22.332 --> 18:27.201
Bad dog. You are a very bad dog.
Never again are you gonna travel.

18:34.077 --> 18:36.841
Take me to the Paul Mitchell
hair salon.

18:37.381 --> 18:39.781
- First time in New York!
- Yes, my friend.

18:40.184 --> 18:41.708
So, what brings you here!

18:41.885 --> 18:43.352
I have a dream.

18:44.021 --> 18:45.420
I had a dream too.

18:45.589 --> 18:46.920
What dream you have!

18:47.090 --> 18:48.921
My dream was to come to America...

18:49.092 --> 18:52.118
...and make enough money
to send for me brothers and sisters...

18:52.296 --> 18:54.560
...so that we all could enjoy
freedom together.

18:54.731 --> 18:56.756
- This is good dream.
- Oh, yes, it is.

18:56.934 --> 18:59.129
- Is dream come true!
- No, man.

18:59.303 --> 19:01.737
Me brothers and sisters
were hacked to death.

19:01.905 --> 19:05.466
But I love the Chinese food here.
It's incredible.

20:15.546 --> 20:19.107
- Hey, you forgot these.
- Those are for you, my friend.

20:28.125 --> 20:31.788
Good morning for you.
I am here to meet Mr. Paul Mitchell.

20:31.962 --> 20:33.054
And who are you!

20:34.531 --> 20:38.490
Scrappy Coco.
I am here to take a job from him.

20:38.669 --> 20:40.068
He isn't in right now.

20:40.237 --> 20:41.966
That's good. So I will wait, then.

20:45.509 --> 20:48.569
You know what! I'll take
one Fizzy Bubblech, a raspberry.

20:48.979 --> 20:51.948
You know,
he actually doesn't come in too often.

20:52.115 --> 20:54.811
Yes, just tell him I am perfect for this,
so let's go.

20:54.985 --> 20:57.112
- I am the best.
- The best at what!

20:57.287 --> 21:01.189
All of this. The cutting, the styling,
the making it silky smooth.

21:01.358 --> 21:03.019
I wanna know who cuts your hair.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.891
Oh, you like this, eh!

21:05.062 --> 21:07.997
This is the Avalon,
straight from the Paul Mitchell book.

21:08.165 --> 21:12.261
I haven't seen that style
since Luke married Laura.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.197
Sister, are you this Laura!

21:16.673 --> 21:22.509
You tell Paul Mitchell,
Scrappy Coco was here to see him.

21:23.614 --> 21:26.708
If I find out he was here...

21:26.883 --> 21:29.716
...or you are keeping him
hidden from me...

21:29.886 --> 21:31.717
...I will destroy you.

21:31.888 --> 21:34.118
Believe me this.

22:29.644 --> 22:32.306
What the hell was this, champ!
I'm not paying for that!

22:32.480 --> 22:34.778
This asshole cut me off,
made me swerve into you!

22:34.949 --> 22:37.782
With all due respect,
I was in the bicycle lane.

22:37.952 --> 22:40.352
You came like a madman.
Be glad nobody was hurt.

22:40.522 --> 22:43.821
I mean, somebody could've died.
I mean, you came...

22:45.093 --> 22:47.584
Okay, real mature, sir. Real mature.

22:47.762 --> 22:50.424
You do not want to be
throwing bicycles.

22:50.598 --> 22:52.930
Look, stay out of my business,
Mustafa.

22:53.101 --> 22:56.264
"Mustafa"! This is not my name.
Who tells you this is my name!

22:56.438 --> 22:58.565
Whatever.
Salami, bologna, apple sauce.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.764
Apple who!

22:59.941 --> 23:02.375
My friend, if I were you,
I would change the tone.

23:02.544 --> 23:03.670
Avoid the pain.

23:03.845 --> 23:07.178
Listen, go back to your goddamned
pretzel stand. We got it...

23:08.550 --> 23:10.814
- Look what I've got. It's right here.
- Please!

23:10.985 --> 23:12.452
- I've got it.
- Please, let me go.

23:12.620 --> 23:16.386
I never work at pretzel stand.
You like to insult people!

23:17.892 --> 23:20.190
Was that your feet!

23:20.361 --> 23:22.124
Yes, it's the feet. The feet uppercut.

23:23.565 --> 23:24.827
Here comes the double foot.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.167
This is good.

23:27.335 --> 23:30.304
Smell it, smell it, smell it.
Now take it.

23:30.472 --> 23:32.531
- That's for you.
- All right, let me go!

23:32.707 --> 23:34.732
You said you wanted pretzel!

23:37.479 --> 23:38.969
Okay, I'm good.

23:39.147 --> 23:40.580
Beautiful.

23:40.749 --> 23:42.216
You want some chickens!

23:42.383 --> 23:44.317
No, no, no. I fix for you.

23:50.625 --> 23:51.922
<i>It's all b'seder.</i>

23:52.093 --> 23:54.186
What are you, bionic!

23:54.362 --> 23:57.195
No, no, no. I only like the girls.

23:58.366 --> 24:00.425
Thanks, anyways.

24:04.906 --> 24:07.500
This is ridiculous traffic.

24:07.675 --> 24:11.042
Anyway, George insisted
we have the party.

24:11.212 --> 24:14.181
- I always get midnight shift.
- Could you keep it down, please!

24:14.349 --> 24:16.681
I no sleep,
I no see World Series Poker.

24:16.851 --> 24:19.012
Are you even watching the road!

24:19.187 --> 24:23.089
Be nice. He could be a terrorist.

24:23.258 --> 24:27.752
- Why Hamdi no get no midnight!
- Could you at least change the station!

24:33.168 --> 24:35.363
- Hey, that was amazing.
- Oh, yes.

24:35.537 --> 24:37.129
Where are you from, anyway!

24:37.305 --> 24:39.466
Where am I from!

24:39.641 --> 24:40.801
Australia.

24:40.975 --> 24:43.034
Really!
Because you sound Middle Eastern.

24:43.211 --> 24:45.008
No, no, no. Similar accents.

24:45.180 --> 24:47.910
- Kangaroo. You see!
- Sure.

24:49.984 --> 24:52.111
This is ridiculous. We're getting out.

24:52.287 --> 24:55.120
- Come on, dear.
- I've been working longer than Hamdi.

24:57.025 --> 24:59.357
- You want me to get you home!
- No, I'll grab a cab.

24:59.527 --> 25:01.461
You've done enough.
That was crazy.

25:01.629 --> 25:03.722
<i>Whose lockzie do I have to schluck?</i>

25:05.400 --> 25:07.698
Oh, you know you're boning me.
I don't know that.

25:10.171 --> 25:11.229
It's you.

25:13.274 --> 25:15.265
- What is happening!
- What's happening!

25:15.443 --> 25:16.774
<i>It's bullshaklaga.</i>

25:16.945 --> 25:18.242
- We have to go.
- Go where!

25:18.413 --> 25:20.176
- I'll run you.
- What are you doing!

25:20.348 --> 25:22.441
This is legal!

25:26.688 --> 25:30.124
Scrappy, have another kneidlach.
Come on.

25:30.291 --> 25:31.758
You're very nice, Mrs. Klayman.

25:31.926 --> 25:35.692
It reminds me of my mother's cooking
in Australia.

25:35.864 --> 25:39.356
Really!
It's funny, you don't sound Australian.

25:39.534 --> 25:42.697
Yes, no, no, no.
This is because I am half Australian...

25:42.871 --> 25:45.362
...half Mount Everest.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.838
So this is what you're hearing.

25:48.943 --> 25:52.071
Well, Australia,
it must be really nice there...

25:52.247 --> 25:54.306
...since they got rid of the apartheid.

25:54.482 --> 25:56.507
Oh, yes, the weather is much cooler.

25:58.152 --> 26:01.383
So, Scrappy,
I understand you cut hair.

26:02.156 --> 26:04.386
I will be working
with Mr. Paul Mitchell...

26:04.559 --> 26:07.027
...as soon as I find out
where they are hiding him.

26:07.195 --> 26:10.028
Oh, Mom, Scrappy
doesn't have a place to stay yet.

26:10.198 --> 26:11.256
- Really!
- Not yet.

26:11.432 --> 26:13.798
Well, actually,
there's a nice one-bedroom...

26:13.968 --> 26:16.368
...that just opened up upstairs.

26:16.537 --> 26:19.131
Nice light, not huge.

26:19.307 --> 26:21.366
And they redid the kitchen very well.

26:22.210 --> 26:24.576
- This could be good.
- Could be good.

26:26.047 --> 26:27.878
Could be good.

26:37.492 --> 26:39.960
Hey, Mom,
do you know where the detergent is!

26:40.128 --> 26:42.289
- That's very good.
- Oh, my God!

26:42.463 --> 26:43.725
What! What's the matter!

26:43.932 --> 26:46.127
What's the matter! That's my mom.

26:46.301 --> 26:48.394
- It's okay, Michael.
- I know it's your mother.

26:48.569 --> 26:49.558
She's very beautiful.

26:49.737 --> 26:51.705
Michael, I haven't made sticky
in two days.

26:51.873 --> 26:54.865
- What do you want from me!
- Couldn't you wait till I was asleep!

26:55.043 --> 26:56.806
- Or dead!
- No, Michael.

26:56.978 --> 26:58.673
You do... What's he doing now!

26:58.846 --> 27:01.314
Why'd that happen!
Why'd that happen!

27:01.482 --> 27:02.972
It's okay. Let me talk to him.

27:03.151 --> 27:04.812
Oh, I can't get up.

27:04.986 --> 27:07.682
No, no. You'll feel your legs again
in two hours.

27:09.357 --> 27:10.654
Michael.

27:10.825 --> 27:13.658
Come on, this is nothing
to feel bad about.

27:13.828 --> 27:15.921
Me sexing your mother.

27:16.097 --> 27:19.066
It's beautiful. It's natural.

27:19.233 --> 27:22.168
No, I didn't bring you home
to do it with my mother.

27:22.337 --> 27:25.067
Why not, huh!
You don't want her to be happy!

27:25.239 --> 27:27.639
Did you see her! Did you look at her!

27:27.809 --> 27:30.141
I don't think
I can ever look at her again.

27:30.311 --> 27:33.974
Michael, her face
during the big bang-boom!

27:34.148 --> 27:35.308
You did not see!

27:35.483 --> 27:37.110
She was glowing.

27:37.285 --> 27:39.344
Patches. What are you...!

27:39.520 --> 27:40.953
Michael, come on.

27:41.122 --> 27:43.113
They'll be plenty of time
for you and me.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.623
Tonight, I take you to disco, huh!
How's this!

27:45.793 --> 27:47.784
No, why would I wanna go
to a disco tonight!

27:48.863 --> 27:51.024
Michael, you should go. It'd be fun!

27:51.199 --> 27:53.030
You could use a little stank.

27:53.201 --> 27:56.261
<i>Yes, you need your penachim
to take a swim.</i>

27:56.437 --> 27:59.133
Yeah, a little chicken of the sea.
It wouldn't hurt.

27:59.307 --> 28:02.572
Disco, disco.
Let's do this, Michael. Yes or no!

28:02.744 --> 28:04.041
Come on, you get to disco.

28:04.212 --> 28:06.544
- All right, fine, I'll go to the disco.
- Okay.

28:06.714 --> 28:09.410
I do your mother one more time,
and then we go.

28:09.584 --> 28:11.518
- Wha...!
- Seconds already!

28:11.686 --> 28:13.381
Oh, yes.

28:18.826 --> 28:21.522
Hey. Look at this.

28:21.696 --> 28:24.893
This is what you need, man,
to let off a little steam, huh!

28:25.066 --> 28:28.763
How many times a day do you
make sticky! Two! Five! Twelve!

28:28.936 --> 28:32.167
How many times a day!
I've had sex once in my life.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.036
It was at tennis camp.
It was awful.

28:35.209 --> 28:38.474
You're too picky, Michael.
Maybe that's the problem.

28:38.646 --> 28:41.774
Every weed in the desert
is still a flower.

28:42.283 --> 28:45.081
Look at this. This a big one, eh!

28:45.253 --> 28:49.656
But look at the tits.
These will bounce nice for you.

28:49.824 --> 28:53.260
<i>Your mother, she has huge poopeh.</i>

28:53.428 --> 28:55.988
I mean, very wide.

28:56.164 --> 29:01.727
But what I see are two big, strong legs
wrapped around my head, squeezing.

29:01.903 --> 29:03.598
<i>So who wants to get some
poontachen?</i>

29:05.540 --> 29:09.203
<i>- I wanna get some poontachen?
- Well, let's get some. Yes.</i>

29:13.781 --> 29:15.715
It's good for you. Nice spinning.

29:18.519 --> 29:21.283
This is what I'm talking about.
You play this.

29:21.456 --> 29:23.447
- I ain't playing this corny shit.
- No, no.

29:23.624 --> 29:25.785
I need to set the
mood for my friend.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.053
Get out,
you Daisy Duke-wearing motherf...

29:38.606 --> 29:40.597
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

29:40.775 --> 29:42.470
- Disco, disco.
- Good, good!

29:55.990 --> 29:57.480
Yes, hello. Hello.

29:57.658 --> 30:00.559
Hey, Zohan.

30:00.728 --> 30:02.252
Who you looking for!

30:02.430 --> 30:05.228
It's okay, no one can hear me
in disco, Zohan.

30:05.399 --> 30:07.594
<i>Can you believe the poontachat
in this place!</i>

30:07.768 --> 30:11.329
I'm not Zohan.
My name is Scrappy Coco, my friend.

30:11.506 --> 30:14.475
What!
Of course you are Zohan Dvir.

30:14.642 --> 30:18.043
They all think you dead in Israel.
I'm not going to tell.

30:18.212 --> 30:20.908
Tell what!
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:21.082 --> 30:24.882
Zohan, it's okay.
Don't worry, I'm a huge fan.

30:25.052 --> 30:28.385
The way you took out
Abdullah Meda in '94.

30:28.556 --> 30:33.289
And when you made Melami Benazir
eat his own shit in '97.

30:33.461 --> 30:35.861
I can't believe I'm meeting you, man.

30:36.030 --> 30:38.055
<i>So, what the fachma
are you doing here!</i>

30:38.232 --> 30:39.631
Come with me.

30:40.668 --> 30:42.795
Look, I couldn't take
all the fighting anymore.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.370
- What's it all for!
- Are you crazy!

30:45.540 --> 30:47.974
If I could blow a terrorist
inside out like you...

30:48.142 --> 30:50.337
...this is all I would do.
I'd never sleep.

30:50.511 --> 30:53.207
- This is exaggeration.
- No, it's not.

30:53.381 --> 30:57.647
You made Palami Habdallah's poodle
sit on a live grenade.

30:57.818 --> 31:01.049
- You gotta show me how you did that.
- I don't remember. I was young.

31:01.222 --> 31:03.884
So tell me the truth.
Why are you in America!

31:05.092 --> 31:06.116
I no want to tell you.

31:06.594 --> 31:08.459
What! What! Come on.

31:08.629 --> 31:13.396
You are the best, Zohan.
Whatever you say is good.

31:16.871 --> 31:19.738
I want to be hairdresser.

31:20.608 --> 31:22.337
<i>You a fagala?</i>

31:22.510 --> 31:24.000
I can't believe it.

31:24.178 --> 31:27.909
<i>A great warrior, but also a fagala
with the penachim.</i>

31:28.082 --> 31:31.051
No, no, no. I like hair.

31:31.219 --> 31:33.813
Come on, man, I get you real job.

31:33.988 --> 31:36.718
You come by my shop tomorrow.

31:36.891 --> 31:39.086
Israeli electronics. Are you crazy!

31:39.260 --> 31:42.991
- Everyone will recognize me.
- No, you don't look like same Zohan.

31:43.164 --> 31:44.461
You have silly haircut now.

31:44.632 --> 31:46.896
- I have what haircut!
- What!

31:47.068 --> 31:49.298
- You say I look silly!
- No, no. Who said this!

31:49.470 --> 31:51.631
- You said this.
- No, no. Nobody say nothing.

31:53.374 --> 31:54.398
I don't need your job.

31:54.575 --> 31:58.807
I get my own job on my own
at a big salon. You will see.

32:01.082 --> 32:03.016
You ever cut a sister's hair before!

32:03.184 --> 32:07.086
Yes. Sister, brother, grandma,
grandpa, the whole family.

32:07.255 --> 32:08.449
I'm good at this.

32:08.623 --> 32:10.682
Have you ever worked
with dreads before!

32:14.996 --> 32:16.054
This is what you do.

32:16.230 --> 32:18.494
No more. This creature slayed.

32:18.666 --> 32:22.625
It's not a problem. Okay, he's got me.
He's got me. He's got me. Okay.

32:23.304 --> 32:25.829
Okay. So we blind him in the eyes.
We got you.

32:26.007 --> 32:28.032
And we finish him.

32:28.209 --> 32:32.145
You back away, I take hold of him.
Go! Go! Go out! Go now!

32:32.313 --> 32:33.871
Go!

32:35.883 --> 32:39.341
This is hair. This is hair.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.648
Oh, okay. The joke's on me, eh!

32:44.492 --> 32:48.053
A big part of our job here
is making this a fun experience.

32:48.229 --> 32:49.457
Of course, of course.

32:49.630 --> 32:53.361
For a lot of kids, this is their first cut,
and it can be very frightening.

32:53.534 --> 32:56.697
- I can imagine.
- I don't want a haircut.

32:56.871 --> 32:58.463
Get away from me.

32:58.639 --> 33:00.869
Let me go.

33:01.042 --> 33:04.409
Young man, look what I found here.

33:04.578 --> 33:06.671
A nice balloon.

33:06.847 --> 33:09.077
Do you want it! It's right here.

33:09.850 --> 33:11.442
You shouldn't jump around...

33:11.619 --> 33:14.315
...when this nice woman's
holding a sharp pair of scissors.

33:14.822 --> 33:18.883
If you move, she could slip and
slice your jugular vein on accident.

33:19.393 --> 33:21.657
There's no way to stitch the jugular.

33:21.829 --> 33:24.821
All of your blood will be on the floor
in four minutes.

33:25.266 --> 33:28.861
I've seen this. I've done this.
You don't want this.

33:39.914 --> 33:43.873
Well, then, at least it's a good time to
shave his neck. I would get him quick.

33:47.888 --> 33:50.652
When I was your age
I already killed seven men.

33:50.825 --> 33:53.293
Maybe you should grow up.

34:20.020 --> 34:22.784
I promise you you won't regret.

34:22.956 --> 34:25.187
And come back.

34:25.359 --> 34:28.418
"Fujigawa"! I don't know that brand.
It really isn't...

34:28.596 --> 34:31.224
It's not really Fujigawa.
It's Sony guts.

34:31.399 --> 34:35.335
- Wouldn't it be better with the Sony...
- Oh, no, no, no. This is what you want.

34:35.503 --> 34:38.597
- Four-hundred fifty.
- But the ad says "Sony," and "300."

34:38.773 --> 34:42.971
No, no, no. What you going to believe,
me or the ad! Four-fifty.

34:44.411 --> 34:47.313
Hello, Going Out of Business.
Can I help you!

34:47.481 --> 34:49.608
Sony, yes. Three hundred.

34:49.784 --> 34:51.752
Come in, yes. Very good, very good.

34:54.621 --> 34:57.056
Hi. I represent the new owner
of this building.

34:57.224 --> 34:59.818
Good for you. Want a birthday cake!
What do you want!

34:59.994 --> 35:01.154
Yamaha is very good.

35:01.328 --> 35:03.489
Did you receive our letter
regarding your rent!

35:03.664 --> 35:06.599
- This I don't know.
- It's being raised to 20,000 a month.

35:06.767 --> 35:08.098
No, no, no. This is too much.

35:08.269 --> 35:10.294
Eighty-five hundred
is all we'll give you.

35:10.471 --> 35:13.531
- This isn't negotiable. We can get...
- Ten thousand, that's all.

35:13.707 --> 35:14.867
We both go home happy.

35:15.042 --> 35:17.738
- I'm sorry. We can't settle for less.
- Okay, no deal.

35:17.912 --> 35:19.709
You come back when you
want to deal.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.472
- Sir, you don't understand.
- Go.

35:21.649 --> 35:25.050
What you still here for! You like me!
I have girlfriend. Go.

35:25.219 --> 35:27.346
Thank you very much.

35:30.591 --> 35:34.049
Hey, look who's here.

35:34.228 --> 35:35.490
Come on, not so loud.

35:35.663 --> 35:39.190
Don't worry, Zohan.
I tell you, they don't recognize you.

35:39.366 --> 35:43.268
Yosi. This is good man.
This Chocolaté Coco.

35:43.437 --> 35:46.133
- Scrappy Coco.
- Scrappy Coco.

35:46.307 --> 35:47.399
Cooking Who-co!

35:48.275 --> 35:49.537
Yes, yes.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.234
So you're going out of business!

35:51.412 --> 35:54.575
No, no, no, no. Is just a sign.
Is good for business.

35:55.182 --> 35:59.312
Yeah, so you look me up, man.
That's cool.

35:59.487 --> 36:01.853
I come for job.

36:03.157 --> 36:06.422
Job. So you not big hairstyle!

36:07.995 --> 36:13.524
It's not really happening for me
so far.

36:13.701 --> 36:16.534
So I am here. So let's go.

36:19.173 --> 36:21.437
No. No job.

36:21.609 --> 36:23.702
What do you mean!
You tell me to come here.

36:23.878 --> 36:27.211
I can no let you do this.
You want to be hair homo.

36:27.381 --> 36:30.111
<i>No, so I do this for now.
It's all yofi tofi.</i>

36:30.284 --> 36:32.275
Is no now.

36:32.887 --> 36:38.621
Once you start in electronics store,
you never get out.

36:40.261 --> 36:42.422
Look at Ephraim. You see!

36:42.596 --> 36:44.860
I don't see nothing wrong with that.
It's perfect.

36:45.032 --> 36:47.193
Ephraim came to America...

36:47.735 --> 36:51.136
...to be racing car driver.

36:51.972 --> 36:53.872
But he let slip away.

36:54.041 --> 36:57.033
I can hear it. Look. Check your ear.

36:57.211 --> 37:02.376
Pinchas wanted to be
the next Bill Cosby.

37:02.550 --> 37:05.917
No. Is resistant, no proof.
You don't understand!

37:06.620 --> 37:10.556
But the store kept pulling him back.

37:10.724 --> 37:12.316
Maybe you swimming with the watch.

37:12.493 --> 37:14.051
- I'm not swimming...
- Is resistant.

37:15.629 --> 37:20.396
Yosi wanted to be a hand model.

37:20.568 --> 37:23.503
What, you don't like this! Look at this.
This is most beautiful.

37:23.671 --> 37:25.298
But he got too comfortable here.

37:25.472 --> 37:28.498
Press this button, it's free HBO.

37:29.043 --> 37:33.878
The electronics store
is a dream killer.

37:34.982 --> 37:39.646
And I won't let the Zohan
kill his dream.

37:42.089 --> 37:46.025
<i>You are a real mensch, Oori.</i>

37:46.193 --> 37:49.560
<i>You the mensch.</i>

37:49.730 --> 37:50.788
Come.

37:50.965 --> 37:52.023
What! What's this!

37:52.199 --> 37:55.965
You may not go for this,
but this place cross the street...

37:56.136 --> 37:58.161
- Yes!
- They maybe take you.

37:58.772 --> 38:02.173
- Is good place!
- No, is dump, but they take you.

38:02.343 --> 38:04.470
Is on Palestinian side of street.

38:04.645 --> 38:05.942
Palestinian!

38:06.113 --> 38:09.446
No, no, no.
Look, nobody kill you there.

38:09.617 --> 38:10.879
Here nobody care.

38:11.051 --> 38:13.110
First off, no one kill me anywhere.

38:13.821 --> 38:16.085
But Palestinian, no.

38:16.256 --> 38:18.349
I've done enough
to my parents already.

38:18.525 --> 38:20.823
I just want job for the Zohan.

38:20.995 --> 38:22.986
And it kills me
the way Phantom bastard...

38:23.163 --> 38:26.030
<i>...getting his buttochim kissed
in Palestine now.</i>

38:26.200 --> 38:28.532
<i>Buttochim kissed! What's this!</i>

38:28.969 --> 38:30.231
He have business.

38:30.404 --> 38:32.304
He buy wives.

38:33.607 --> 38:34.972
Him!

38:35.142 --> 38:38.578
They say his ugly face everywhere.

38:39.146 --> 38:42.206
<i>Everyone is running
To Phantom's Chewy Muchentuchen</i>

38:42.349 --> 38:45.750
<i>For the food the heroes eat</i>

38:46.120 --> 38:49.180
<i>Kubeh, sambouesk,
Delicious muchentuchen</i>

38:49.356 --> 38:51.449
<i>You never know who you'll meet</i>

38:51.625 --> 38:55.425
<i>You are going to get spoiled.</i>

39:01.535 --> 39:04.095
<i>Phantom Muchentuchen!</i>

39:04.271 --> 39:05.795
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

39:05.973 --> 39:08.066
<i>This month,
order Muchentuchen Happy Lunch...</i>

39:08.242 --> 39:11.370
<i>... and get action figures from
Phantom Presents: Death to Zohan.</i>

39:15.015 --> 39:16.846
Unbelievable.

39:17.017 --> 39:22.045
This animal gets to live his dream.
But, me, l...

39:22.589 --> 39:26.753
I can no work Palestinian, no.
It's like... I can't do this.

39:26.927 --> 39:28.292
Yes, you can.

39:28.462 --> 39:32.398
Is your dream to cut hair.
You want fight, or you want hair!

39:32.566 --> 39:35.797
I want hair. But I'm scared.

39:35.969 --> 39:38.767
Is America.
You can do anything here.

39:38.939 --> 39:42.534
You never done something
people thought was impossible!

39:45.012 --> 39:47.947
So you don't want to talk, huh!
I'll make you talk.

40:07.735 --> 40:08.827
I can do this.

40:20.948 --> 40:22.438
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

40:22.616 --> 40:24.311
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

40:24.485 --> 40:26.214
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

40:26.386 --> 40:27.853
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

40:28.021 --> 40:29.784
<i>Disco, disco, good, good.</i>

40:31.658 --> 40:34.456
So you have never cut hair before.

40:34.628 --> 40:37.495
I have cut my own hair
and several dogs.

40:38.165 --> 40:42.261
I have the Paul Mitchell book,
I have the stamina, the desire...

40:42.436 --> 40:44.802
But you have no training
or experience.

40:44.972 --> 40:49.033
Would you hire someone
with experience in something else!

40:49.510 --> 40:50.534
In what!

40:50.911 --> 40:53.141
Can anyone here do this!

41:00.320 --> 41:03.483
Okay. I have never seen that.

41:03.657 --> 41:06.455
That is very nice,
but that is not going to help me.

41:06.627 --> 41:09.095
No hands.

41:09.263 --> 41:10.787
Besides, I have no openings.

41:10.964 --> 41:12.693
If anything, I need to scale back...

41:12.866 --> 41:15.357
...since they just raised my rent
through the roof.

41:15.536 --> 41:20.098
Out of nowhere, some guy with a tie
comes in and tells me I need to pay.

41:20.274 --> 41:21.468
Stop it!

41:22.876 --> 41:25.743
I only wish to learn.

41:25.913 --> 41:28.245
I will do whatever it takes.

41:31.084 --> 41:34.645
Fine. You can sweep up hair
a few shifts a week.

41:34.822 --> 41:36.813
- You won't be...
- No pay.

41:36.990 --> 41:40.153
No, no, no.
But then, I will become stylist, yes!

41:40.761 --> 41:41.955
That could be a while.

41:42.129 --> 41:44.529
I will wait turn. You will see.

41:44.698 --> 41:47.929
I will get nighttime job for money.

41:48.101 --> 41:50.729
Soon the whole world
will be silky smooth.

42:01.048 --> 42:02.072
Zohan.

42:02.249 --> 42:04.843
- Carmen Electra has the best tits now.
- Oh, please.

42:05.018 --> 42:08.044
Oh, my God.
I wonder how much she paid for them.

42:09.356 --> 42:11.586
They're so perky.

42:11.758 --> 42:14.727
You know, leave it to her
to buy the best tits.

42:14.895 --> 42:17.329
It's always first class with that one.

42:17.497 --> 42:20.660
You know you don't have to catch
every piece of hair as it falls.

42:20.834 --> 42:25.203
Yes, I do. You deserve a perfect floor.
One single hair is unacceptable.

42:25.372 --> 42:26.396
As you were.

42:40.187 --> 42:41.950
Yes. I got this.

42:43.323 --> 42:45.689
"Did you see
the new Kate Hudson movie!

42:45.859 --> 42:48.919
I think she is even more vivacious
than her mother."

42:49.096 --> 42:53.260
Scrappeleh, that's wonderful.
Now, let's practice on Michael.

42:53.433 --> 42:56.561
Michael!
Could you come in here, please!

42:57.337 --> 42:58.634
What! What is...!

42:58.805 --> 43:01.740
Oh, Scrappy needs to practice
small-talking.

43:01.909 --> 43:05.276
Can we do this another time! I have
a shot at keeping my food down.

43:05.445 --> 43:07.003
Michael, I want to practice now.

43:07.180 --> 43:10.115
I'm afraid I'm terrible at this.
Why won't you help me!

43:10.284 --> 43:15.278
Oh, honey.
You are good at everything you do.

43:39.680 --> 43:41.375
- Got it.
- Thanks.

43:41.548 --> 43:43.743
So you're making her silky smooth,
huh, Claude!

43:43.917 --> 43:47.148
- Framing her face!
- Yeah, Scrappy. I'm framing her face.

43:47.321 --> 43:48.481
This is smart.

43:48.655 --> 43:52.250
A nice layered style
with the soft bangs...

43:52.426 --> 43:54.519
...is good for a bigger woman
like this.

43:54.695 --> 43:56.890
- Coco.
- Takes the eyes off the moon face...

43:57.064 --> 43:58.827
<i>...and brings it toward the titzim.</i>

43:58.999 --> 44:00.830
Coco.

44:01.001 --> 44:02.195
I need to speak to you.

44:03.704 --> 44:04.966
In private.

44:06.106 --> 44:08.631
Private. A secret!

44:08.809 --> 44:11.209
They will never get it out of me,
I promise you.

44:11.378 --> 44:14.575
Coco, Claude is trying to work.

44:14.748 --> 44:16.375
Yes. He's very good.

44:16.550 --> 44:19.417
So I am ready to cut hair today.
So let's go, let's get it on.

44:19.586 --> 44:21.486
No. Let's not go.

44:21.655 --> 44:22.679
But I am the best.

44:22.856 --> 44:24.824
Don't tell me you're the best.

44:24.992 --> 44:27.756
- I have the desire, the stamina.
- You've been here two days.

44:27.928 --> 44:29.657
I run this place for five years.

44:29.830 --> 44:32.594
I think I know when you are ready
to cut hair.

44:32.766 --> 44:35.428
Okay, Jeez! Get a room, you two.

44:35.602 --> 44:37.627
No, no, no.

44:37.804 --> 44:40.739
<i>I do not touch this
with your penachim.</i>

44:42.175 --> 44:43.870
Out of respect for the working.

44:44.211 --> 44:47.305
No, you don't eat where you shit.

44:47.481 --> 44:50.939
Or shit where you eat.
Whatever the...

44:51.118 --> 44:52.779
The smell is bad.

44:55.822 --> 44:57.084
This is called a comb.

44:59.092 --> 45:02.061
- With the fingers!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

45:03.597 --> 45:06.998
- Scrappy.
- I'm sorry. Here, I take your leg up.

45:07.167 --> 45:08.862
I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry.

45:09.036 --> 45:11.095
- Okay. All right.
- I apologize.

45:11.271 --> 45:13.705
- Take him where he wants to go.
- Thank you. Okay.

45:13.874 --> 45:15.398
- Good luck.
- It will be fine.

45:15.575 --> 45:19.102
- Your limousine has arrived, sir.
- You're observant, Tyler.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.677
Thank you, Big Mac.

45:21.848 --> 45:25.750
I am really late for a hotel opening
downtown. The Walbridge Hotel.

45:25.919 --> 45:29.082
I understand, sir. I know the
neighborhoods inside and backwards.

45:29.256 --> 45:31.588
- We will not let them stop us.
- What!

45:37.130 --> 45:38.495
I'm not in much of a hurry.

45:42.102 --> 45:44.229
Oh, no.

45:47.507 --> 45:48.997
You want some coffee back there!

45:49.176 --> 45:50.575
No!

45:51.078 --> 45:52.272
I will lose them.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.240
Nobody is following us.

46:01.988 --> 46:03.751
Oh, shit!

46:17.137 --> 46:19.002
Have a good time, sir.

46:23.043 --> 46:26.035
Debbie, you did a good job.

46:26.213 --> 46:29.580
You look very bangable,
Mrs. Rosen.

46:30.417 --> 46:32.851
Mrs. Paulson, I must tell you...

46:33.019 --> 46:37.046
...when you first came in,
you looked hideous.

46:37.224 --> 46:38.555
There was nothing attractive.

46:38.725 --> 46:43.753
<i>But now, I must say,
my schtitzel, it's about to burst.</i>

46:43.930 --> 46:46.626
- It could break these any...
- What are you doing!

46:46.800 --> 46:49.564
We are talking shop.

46:49.736 --> 46:51.829
No. No.

46:52.572 --> 46:54.335
- Look, Coco...
- What!

46:54.508 --> 46:56.408
You need to calm down now, okay!

46:56.576 --> 46:59.374
I don't think these customers
like the way you talk shop.

46:59.546 --> 47:00.672
Nobody say this.

47:00.847 --> 47:06.149
Coco, remember,
respect for the workplace.

47:07.954 --> 47:09.888
I have betrayed my salon.

47:14.194 --> 47:15.491
He's trying to kill himself.

47:15.662 --> 47:16.993
- Scrappy.
- I deserve this.

47:17.164 --> 47:20.361
No, no. Just... Just...

47:20.934 --> 47:23.266
Easy on the ladies.

47:23.870 --> 47:26.031
I didn't mind.

47:31.178 --> 47:33.043
Take care, Mrs. Paulson.

47:34.014 --> 47:36.039
She did not mind.

47:38.952 --> 47:42.080
Let me disinfect the scissors...

47:42.822 --> 47:47.521
...so someone else
can make someone else silky smooth.

47:48.562 --> 47:50.393
I'll just clean up.

47:55.468 --> 47:57.527
Rafaela's Salon.

47:57.704 --> 47:59.638
What! No.

48:02.709 --> 48:03.937
Debbie, she quit.

48:04.711 --> 48:06.474
- What!
- Sorry.

48:06.947 --> 48:09.108
Claude, did you know about this!

48:09.282 --> 48:10.544
I should have told you.

48:10.717 --> 48:14.084
She's been looking for a new job
since those rent guys came around.

48:14.254 --> 48:16.620
Then why you no say nothing,
little bitch!

48:18.525 --> 48:21.961
Don't worry,
I'm not giving up on this place.

48:22.128 --> 48:25.393
<i>You're a good guy, habibi.
I just... I don't know what to do.</i>

48:30.537 --> 48:32.061
So let's go.

48:32.239 --> 48:35.265
Scrappy, I have enough problems
right now.

48:38.478 --> 48:40.844
I not the problem. I the solution. I fix.

48:41.014 --> 48:43.175
But if you screw up...

48:43.350 --> 48:45.750
I can't afford a screwup right now.

48:45.919 --> 48:49.047
No, no, no. I no screw up.
I am the best for the job.

48:49.222 --> 48:51.986
Yeah, but you push and push.
"When is my turn"!

48:52.158 --> 48:53.750
I have to care about salon.

48:53.927 --> 48:55.258
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

48:55.428 --> 49:00.024
You care about you. And don't fight
in front of the customer.

49:02.769 --> 49:07.399
Mrs. Skitzer,
I am afraid our stylist is out today.

49:07.574 --> 49:10.702
Would you care to wait for Claude!

49:12.112 --> 49:13.170
Does he do hair!

49:16.016 --> 49:19.315
He's not a regular.

49:19.486 --> 49:20.783
Well, that's fine.

49:23.156 --> 49:28.458
She say...
I mean, only if it's okay with Dalia.

49:30.797 --> 49:32.059
Okay.

49:32.899 --> 49:38.030
You will not regret this decision.

49:41.541 --> 49:44.237
Mrs. Skitzer, let's cut your hair.

49:44.811 --> 49:48.406
Just lay back, Mrs. Skitzer.
I'll take care of everything.

49:48.882 --> 49:51.248
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

49:51.418 --> 49:54.216
Sexy woman like you
deserves to be pampered.

49:54.387 --> 49:56.412
Me, sexy! Sure.

49:56.589 --> 49:57.613
Don't be humble.

49:57.791 --> 50:02.751
You've got the ass and tits
of a schoolgirl and you know it.

50:02.929 --> 50:06.126
And everyone else knows this too,
believe me.

50:06.299 --> 50:07.857
Yes.

50:08.034 --> 50:09.934
Let me get your earring off.

51:59.379 --> 52:00.641
I love it.

52:00.814 --> 52:04.682
Of course you do.
I make you silky smooth. I tell you this.

52:05.251 --> 52:09.119
All right, Scrappy.
You can cut Debbie's clients today.

52:09.289 --> 52:11.883
If they want you.

52:16.563 --> 52:17.587
Thank you.

52:17.764 --> 52:21.325
I'll get to you all soon as I'm
all the way done with Mrs. Skitzer.

52:22.635 --> 52:24.125
That all you got, Mrs. Skitzer!

52:24.304 --> 52:28.468
Come on, baby. Go, baby. Yes. Yes.

52:47.861 --> 52:49.055
So who's next!

53:24.097 --> 53:26.588
Come on, Scrappy!

53:28.368 --> 53:30.802
Thank you, dear.

53:31.304 --> 53:35.331
- It's a lot of speakers.
- Yes. Yes.

53:39.012 --> 53:40.946
It's orgasmic.

53:41.114 --> 53:42.809
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

53:44.017 --> 53:45.985
Oh, yes!

54:00.433 --> 54:03.163
Grab it, Scrappy!

54:11.044 --> 54:13.638
For you. Yes.

54:18.851 --> 54:21.183
I give this to you.

54:29.028 --> 54:32.520
- No. I am sorry, Mr. Paul Mitchell.
- Hear me out, Scrappy, please.

54:32.699 --> 54:36.430
I'll give you stock options.
I'll name a shampoo after you.

54:36.603 --> 54:41.097
No, my loyalty is to here.
I will destroy you.

54:44.377 --> 54:47.642
I heard about this place
from Joanne.

54:47.814 --> 54:50.146
You have to ask for Scrappy.

54:50.316 --> 54:53.308
Yes, is the primary
cardholder present!

54:53.486 --> 54:54.510
Excuse me!

54:54.687 --> 54:57.417
Hello, I am calling
from Spiegel catalogue.

54:57.590 --> 55:00.024
Are you between the ages
of 18 and 39!

55:00.193 --> 55:01.990
We're trying to talk here.

55:02.161 --> 55:04.527
Have you ordered from catalogue
in past six months!

55:04.697 --> 55:06.688
Could you get off the phone
while you drive!

55:06.866 --> 55:09.664
Hey, what's the matter!
I trying to make a living, do my job.

55:09.836 --> 55:10.894
This is your job.

55:11.070 --> 55:12.162
This is job also.

55:12.338 --> 55:13.362
This is not Iraq.

55:13.539 --> 55:15.769
I am Palestine, I'm not Iraq.

55:15.942 --> 55:17.273
And you're not getting a tip.

55:17.443 --> 55:19.172
And you are a stupid cow.

55:19.345 --> 55:20.369
Jeez.

55:20.546 --> 55:23.106
- And we're done. Okay, you, skedaddle.
- Thanks so much.

55:23.282 --> 55:25.682
- I'll see you later.
- All right.

55:26.285 --> 55:28.219
I like this, the red hair.

55:28.388 --> 55:31.653
I bet she has a pumpkin patch
down below, yes!

55:31.824 --> 55:32.882
I don't know.

55:33.059 --> 55:35.653
<i>- Did you tap her tuchus?
- No.</i>

55:35.828 --> 55:38.854
<i>Why don't you go after
the snatchacheem in this place!</i>

55:39.032 --> 55:41.125
They all want you, believe me.

55:41.300 --> 55:43.268
Scrappy, I wouldn't be so sure.

55:43.436 --> 55:45.768
I'm telling you,
you're not picking up the signs.

55:46.439 --> 55:49.101
Come with me.
I'll show you a technique. It's beautiful.

55:49.275 --> 55:53.678
Hello, Mrs. Haynes. How are you!
You want the cut and color today!

55:53.846 --> 55:55.211
Yes, please. Thanks.

55:56.215 --> 55:57.239
<i>Watch.</i>

56:00.887 --> 56:03.947
You see! She's going with it.
It's good.

56:04.123 --> 56:05.283
Yep.

56:05.792 --> 56:08.590
- She has a free shoulder. Come join.
- I'm good.

56:09.762 --> 56:12.196
Mrs. Haynes,
you're getting cold here.

56:12.365 --> 56:14.799
Claude, come. Keep her warm.

56:14.967 --> 56:16.628
Go ahead. Yes.

56:17.336 --> 56:21.932
And gently move.
Gently move the shoulder.

56:22.108 --> 56:24.906
All you want to do is let her know
you're here for her.

56:25.101 --> 56:28.161
Now look away
like you're not even doing it.

56:28.337 --> 56:30.271
We're not doing this.

56:30.439 --> 56:31.736
- Same rhythm.
- Okay.

56:31.907 --> 56:34.273
Push. Push. Push.

56:36.078 --> 56:40.742
Oh, you're pushing harder.
It's starting to feel good on my end.

56:40.916 --> 56:44.579
I am trying to make money
to start my own business, huh.

56:44.754 --> 56:47.314
Would you say you read Spiegel
once a month, twice...

56:47.490 --> 56:49.355
Would you just get us
to the hair salon!

56:49.525 --> 56:51.083
We're gonna miss our appointment.

56:51.260 --> 56:54.855
I curse you, and I curse your hair.

56:55.030 --> 56:58.397
What is big deal
about this hair place anyway!

57:00.970 --> 57:02.494
They get worse every year.

57:09.512 --> 57:14.814
Okay, we'll take them to the truck.
We'll just talk to them. But we'll find a...

57:17.820 --> 57:21.449
Did you throw this shoe at me,
my friend!

57:22.625 --> 57:23.956
No!

57:24.126 --> 57:26.686
Sure looks like it was you.

57:31.267 --> 57:33.531
Then who threw it!

57:36.872 --> 57:41.070
Okay. You're lucky I'm in good mood.
I'll let you off the hook.

57:42.545 --> 57:45.309
Nobody spits on me.

57:49.685 --> 57:52.586
Thank you for the goat, my friend.

57:52.755 --> 57:53.779
Yes.

57:54.790 --> 57:57.156
Goat!

57:57.326 --> 57:59.294
Goat.

57:59.461 --> 58:01.986
Goat!

58:02.164 --> 58:04.632
Goat!

58:05.467 --> 58:07.958
Goat.

58:08.137 --> 58:11.129
I said, "Can we have the receipt!"

58:12.308 --> 58:14.868
Yes. Die in hell.

58:18.581 --> 58:19.809
Welcome.

58:23.419 --> 58:26.616
We'll color your hair Bling-Bling
Blond. This is what you need.

58:26.789 --> 58:28.780
You know what else they go for!

58:28.958 --> 58:32.792
The... I don't know what you have,
but mine is the biggest.

58:32.962 --> 58:35.487
This...
It does not get bigger than this.

58:35.664 --> 58:38.895
It's enormous. Scary. I mean:

58:39.068 --> 58:40.228
What!

58:40.669 --> 58:43.263
I have the biggest. It's the biggest.

58:43.439 --> 58:45.100
Take a look at this.

58:45.274 --> 58:47.265
Look.

58:50.012 --> 58:52.242
- It's not that big.
- It's not that...!

58:52.414 --> 58:53.574
No, no, no. The bush.

58:54.183 --> 58:55.844
The bush is the biggest.

58:56.018 --> 58:58.509
And the girls like this
because it's cushion.

59:00.022 --> 59:04.356
<i>It is no bullshaklaga. He is the one.
I never forget a face.</i>

59:04.526 --> 59:06.187
So, what do you want I do!

59:06.729 --> 59:08.629
Wait. I conference you.

59:10.699 --> 59:11.723
Hello!

59:11.901 --> 59:14.927
Nasi, emergency meeting.
You're on with Hamdi as well.

59:15.104 --> 59:17.038
- Hello, Nasi.
- Hello, Hamdi.

59:17.206 --> 59:19.606
Can you believe
how much they pay Delgado!

59:19.775 --> 59:23.006
Yes. Why Mets do this!

59:23.779 --> 59:26.805
This is serious. We meet!

59:26.982 --> 59:29.644
I explain why is emergency.

59:29.818 --> 59:32.616
This is not just man
who take my goat.

59:35.024 --> 59:38.118
- Zohan Dvir.
- Yes.

59:38.294 --> 59:40.421
Everyone think Phantom kill him.

59:40.596 --> 59:41.961
Phantom not kill him.

59:42.131 --> 59:45.760
We will capture,
then make trade with Israel.

59:45.935 --> 59:48.096
We will be heroes.

59:48.270 --> 59:51.967
But, Salim, we are not Jihadim. We
don't know for sure that this is him.

59:52.141 --> 59:55.042
Let's call Hamas, Hezbollah.
Let them handle this.

59:55.210 --> 59:57.235
- Leave it to the pros.
- No.

59:57.413 --> 59:58.812
Hezbollah shmezbollah.

59:58.981 --> 01:00:02.849
Hezbollah will take all the credit.
This is our shot.

01:00:03.018 --> 01:00:04.952
Why not let Phantom capture him!

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.317
Screw Phantom. He hero already.

01:00:08.824 --> 01:00:12.191
<i>Where's my chain
of muchentuchen restaurants!</i>

01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:16.359
Salim, don't make this
about yourself.

01:00:16.532 --> 01:00:17.999
This is about me.

01:00:18.167 --> 01:00:19.794
And about him.

01:00:19.969 --> 01:00:21.937
And about my goat!

01:00:22.671 --> 01:00:25.231
Come on, let's go!

01:00:25.407 --> 01:00:28.808
This is nice,
the walking inside the outside.

01:00:28.978 --> 01:00:32.539
The park, the people,
the horses, the kid.

01:00:32.715 --> 01:00:34.546
Well, you're always downtown.

01:00:34.717 --> 01:00:36.810
You should see
a little more of New York.

01:00:36.986 --> 01:00:38.954
Yes, yes, this is good.

01:00:39.121 --> 01:00:40.679
The talking is good...

01:00:40.856 --> 01:00:43.552
...to get to know each other
before the bang-boom. I like.

01:00:43.726 --> 01:00:47.594
Oh, no, no, no.
There will be no bang-booming.

01:00:47.763 --> 01:00:51.130
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my business.

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.292
- This isn't a date.
- No, no, no.

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:57.667
I feel you have helped me so much...

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.104
The right thing to do
is to tap you so hard...

01:01:00.275 --> 01:01:03.472
<i>...my schtitzel will come out
your poopech. That's what I think.</i>

01:01:03.645 --> 01:01:06.671
Look, why don't we
just enjoy the park!

01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:09.010
No, no, no. This is what we do.

01:01:10.552 --> 01:01:12.986
Hey, look, softball.

01:01:13.155 --> 01:01:16.090
- You like softball!
- Of course, I love softball.

01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:20.058
What is softball! Teach me how to.

01:01:20.229 --> 01:01:22.823
I learned softball
when I came to the States.

01:01:22.998 --> 01:01:25.558
When you're Arab, it helps to fit in.

01:01:25.734 --> 01:01:27.668
Yeah, how long you move here ago!

01:01:27.836 --> 01:01:29.770
Just a few years ago.

01:01:29.938 --> 01:01:34.375
I couldn't take it there anymore.
All the hate, on both sides.

01:01:34.543 --> 01:01:36.602
Yes, especially yours.

01:01:36.779 --> 01:01:39.680
Why you say this! You don't know.

01:01:39.848 --> 01:01:42.078
No, no, I don't. I read this.

01:01:42.251 --> 01:01:46.620
The Australian-Tibet media
is very biased.

01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:50.350
Look, both sides crazy.

01:01:50.526 --> 01:01:51.891
My own family...

01:01:53.095 --> 01:01:54.619
My brother...

01:01:54.797 --> 01:02:00.201
...if he knew I work cross street
from Israelis, he would lose it.

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:03.964
- Really!
- You have the hardcores on both sides.

01:02:04.139 --> 01:02:06.573
They just want to fight and fight.

01:02:06.742 --> 01:02:09.939
Nobody will win this way.
It has to stop.

01:02:11.213 --> 01:02:14.478
When will it end, eh! Yes.

01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:20.052
Okay, so you must be thirsty, no!

01:02:20.556 --> 01:02:22.490
Here.

01:02:22.658 --> 01:02:24.649
Where you get this!

01:02:24.827 --> 01:02:27.261
This! From specialty shop
on West Side.

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:30.956
This Middle Eastern drink.
You know this! Fizzy Bubblech!

01:02:31.133 --> 01:02:34.296
No, no, no. It looks pretty good.

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:37.337
Oh, try, try. It's very good.
Try, have a sip.

01:02:41.577 --> 01:02:42.669
It's not for me.

01:02:42.845 --> 01:02:44.745
No! Really!

01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.648
This is his shop.

01:02:50.819 --> 01:02:53.185
Here is photo for compare.

01:02:53.355 --> 01:02:55.915
For how long this take!
I close the newsstand.

01:02:57.292 --> 01:03:00.853
Make sure you ask him
if he ever hit by shoe.

01:03:01.029 --> 01:03:06.194
And about the prize goat
that can fetch a bowl of onion soup.

01:03:06.802 --> 01:03:10.636
Look in his eyes when you
ask him this, for they will be suffering.

01:03:10.806 --> 01:03:13.036
- You know, I just got haircut.
- Go.

01:03:14.476 --> 01:03:19.277
Look at this. I feel like Hugh Hefner
with all you little bunnies around here.

01:03:22.217 --> 01:03:26.313
Okay, okay,
let's see who is going next.

01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:31.652
"Jorge Posada," where are you!

01:03:31.827 --> 01:03:32.987
That's me.

01:03:34.596 --> 01:03:37.394
Okay, good-looking guy,
you take a seat there. You're next.

01:03:38.066 --> 01:03:40.534
You know, you look like
you already just got haircut.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.629
No, no.

01:03:43.805 --> 01:03:47.673
So I guessing you're looking for
something in the silky smooth area!

01:03:47.843 --> 01:03:51.142
- Well...
- Because I see you have nice curls.

01:03:51.313 --> 01:03:53.907
You don't want to
cut into those curls.

01:03:54.082 --> 01:03:56.016
We will talk about this over there.

01:03:56.185 --> 01:04:00.622
Okay, Scrappy, I wait.

01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:03.383
Is not like I have a shoe to throw.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.491
Sure. Yes. Beautiful. Whatever.

01:04:06.662 --> 01:04:10.826
I don't have time to go watch
a goat fetch soap.

01:04:11.633 --> 01:04:14.693
- What!
- What! I don't know.

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:16.269
Listen, my friend...

01:04:16.438 --> 01:04:19.373
...you want to talk, it's good,
but you have to wait your turn.

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:21.668
First I have to cut and bang
Mrs. Greenhouse.

01:04:21.843 --> 01:04:23.868
- That's right.
- Okay.

01:04:28.417 --> 01:04:30.112
Well, I'm ready for it.

01:04:30.285 --> 01:04:32.480
Oh, dear.

01:04:33.956 --> 01:04:38.586
I am sorry, Mrs. Greenhouse.
I am not man enough for you today.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.524
Oh, Scrappy, it's fine.

01:04:41.697 --> 01:04:45.531
I don't know what the problem is.
I am going to lose business.

01:04:45.701 --> 01:04:49.603
Oh, no, dear. You're still adorable.

01:04:49.771 --> 01:04:52.535
The screwing
was really just a bonus.

01:04:53.408 --> 01:04:56.900
You are an angel, Mrs. Greenhouse.

01:04:57.079 --> 01:05:00.173
An angel with a magic throat.

01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:02.214
Oh, Scrappy!

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:06.954
No, that could work.
One more, please.

01:05:07.122 --> 01:05:08.714
Let's see what we got.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.051
And we're still nothing.

01:05:23.538 --> 01:05:24.562
Well!

01:05:24.740 --> 01:05:26.731
He was very cool.

01:05:26.908 --> 01:05:28.933
Idiot. What did he say!

01:05:29.578 --> 01:05:33.981
He think I have nice curls
that go well with a full face.

01:05:34.149 --> 01:05:37.312
- But was it him!
- Well, it looked like him.

01:05:37.486 --> 01:05:38.953
But hard to know.

01:05:39.121 --> 01:05:43.820
I tell you this: he didn't seem to care
when I talk about goat fetching soap.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:49.593
Soup. The goat fetched soup.
You ruin everything.

01:05:49.765 --> 01:05:51.756
Soup! This makes no sense.

01:05:51.933 --> 01:05:54.834
Screw you. It's him. I know it's him.

01:05:55.003 --> 01:05:58.598
The goat fetched soup!
This is unbelievable.

01:05:58.774 --> 01:06:01.106
Go to hell.

01:06:01.777 --> 01:06:03.005
You said it was urgent!

01:06:03.178 --> 01:06:06.375
It's an emergency.
Please, take a look.

01:06:07.683 --> 01:06:08.707
Yes, yes.

01:06:09.618 --> 01:06:13.554
Well, that's not a real problem.
You can always shave it.

01:06:14.623 --> 01:06:16.648
No, not the bush.

01:06:16.825 --> 01:06:20.784
No, inside the bush.
Look deeper. Him.

01:06:20.962 --> 01:06:23.192
- I see.
- He lays in there all day long.

01:06:23.365 --> 01:06:27.426
Maybe it needs some more oxygen.
It looks like it's being strangled.

01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:31.564
So the Palestinian says to the priest:

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.005
"Okay, but let's skip the bath."

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:38.075
Why, are they not clean!

01:06:38.246 --> 01:06:39.577
No, is good joke.

01:06:40.949 --> 01:06:44.077
Honey, are you all right!
You've been in there for over an hour.

01:06:44.252 --> 01:06:48.621
What is this stuff! I mean, I took one
sip and I repainted the whole toilet.

01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:51.350
Is Fizzy Bubblech.
You'll get used to it, relax.

01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:54.017
I don't wanna get used to it.
My car couldn't.

01:06:56.231 --> 01:06:59.564
- All right, that's it for me. I'm done.
- What! What!

01:06:59.735 --> 01:07:01.134
Is everything all right!

01:07:01.303 --> 01:07:03.362
- Is it about the pee-pee!
- Stop it.

01:07:03.538 --> 01:07:06.200
<i>- The pee-pee!
- He can't do with his peepeechosetz.</i>

01:07:06.375 --> 01:07:09.867
Really!
He's usually as hard as trigonometry.

01:07:10.045 --> 01:07:12.411
- Mom. What...!
- When did this happen!

01:07:13.148 --> 01:07:14.672
The last few days.

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:18.081
Of course. It's ever since
you went out with that Dalia.

01:07:19.354 --> 01:07:24.053
Your hog is telling you something.
She must be the one.

01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:26.751
The one!

01:07:26.928 --> 01:07:28.259
Is this possible!

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:31.092
Of course it's possible, man.

01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:35.464
<i>All the beaverim in the world
and he falls for Palestinian muffich.</i>

01:07:36.104 --> 01:07:38.368
Why should Scrappy care
if she's Palestinian!

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:41.805
He's from Australia and Tibet.
He's not Israeli.

01:07:41.977 --> 01:07:43.308
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:07:45.781 --> 01:07:47.078
Exactly.

01:07:47.249 --> 01:07:48.841
What was that, a motor boat!

01:07:49.017 --> 01:07:50.245
You know, Scrappy...

01:07:50.419 --> 01:07:55.550
...a special woman is special
no matter where she's from.

01:07:55.724 --> 01:07:57.988
Listen to your hog.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:02.196
Someone special.

01:08:02.364 --> 01:08:03.490
Maybe is good.

01:08:03.665 --> 01:08:05.792
It's good! It's terrific!

01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:09.468
I mean, you know,
you guys won't be together anymore...

01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:12.106
...but Scrappy is in love.
That's great, awesome.

01:08:12.841 --> 01:08:14.433
Thank you for your support.

01:08:14.609 --> 01:08:16.201
- Is a good boy.
- Good boy.

01:08:16.377 --> 01:08:19.073
This is fun. Let's celebrate.
Where's the cat!

01:08:19.247 --> 01:08:21.875
Let's cat-sack, huh! Throw it to me.

01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:24.746
- Got you.
- Let's play, man.

01:08:27.522 --> 01:08:29.149
Take it, Michael.

01:08:33.895 --> 01:08:35.020
Look at you.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.898
I wanna try it.

01:08:48.276 --> 01:08:49.402
Is good.

01:08:51.846 --> 01:08:53.678
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah phone line.</i>

01:08:53.849 --> 01:08:56.408

<i>... as we are engaged

<i>We will resume service as soon as

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:21.067
Great.

01:09:21.542 --> 01:09:23.908
Come on. Just think of a bomb.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:28.379
They say you can make bomb from
everyday's material. You combine.

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:31.576
Yes, okay.
But what we combination!

01:09:33.555 --> 01:09:35.078
Just think of chemicals.

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:37.850
Chemicals, like in science class.

01:09:38.026 --> 01:09:39.926
Yes.

01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:48.259
Who remembers this stuff!

01:09:51.072 --> 01:09:52.130
Hello.

01:09:52.307 --> 01:09:54.935
Well, can I help you fellas
find anything!

01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:58.568
Yes, do you have...

01:10:00.582 --> 01:10:05.315
..."liquid nitrogen."

01:10:06.521 --> 01:10:08.148
You need what!

01:10:08.323 --> 01:10:12.987
Liquid nitrogen.

01:10:14.663 --> 01:10:18.463
Yeah. Well, I suppose
we have some of that.

01:10:18.633 --> 01:10:19.895
Now, just a moment.

01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:29.471
- This is it!
- Yes, and that's the large container.

01:10:30.779 --> 01:10:32.337
This works!

01:10:32.514 --> 01:10:34.175
Oh, it works quite well. Yes.

01:10:35.483 --> 01:10:36.507
You use!

01:10:36.685 --> 01:10:40.143
From time to time. Sure.

01:10:44.726 --> 01:10:46.694
We'll take 12.

01:10:47.696 --> 01:10:50.631
Look, you can turn off the water...

01:10:50.799 --> 01:10:53.597
...but we will find a way
to keep on going.

01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.827
Oh, you like when I spray you,
Mrs. Skitzer!

01:10:56.004 --> 01:10:57.801
Where's the $ 14,000!

01:10:58.373 --> 01:11:02.275
I have your rent right here.
There is no getting rid of me.

01:11:02.444 --> 01:11:03.877
We don't wanna get rid of you.

01:11:04.045 --> 01:11:08.482
Mr. Walbridge would actually like to
relocate your salon in our new mall.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.881
You mean the one you want to destroy
this community to build!

01:11:12.053 --> 01:11:14.521
It is not our intent
to destroy this community.

01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:19.793
I'll take the community, Pancake.

01:11:19.961 --> 01:11:23.226
My name is Gray, and I'll be back.

01:11:23.932 --> 01:11:25.661
Nice to meet you, Pancake.

01:11:29.437 --> 01:11:30.461
Why Pancake!

01:11:31.306 --> 01:11:32.330
Just for fun.

01:11:33.108 --> 01:11:35.076
You were amazing right there.

01:11:38.213 --> 01:11:39.237
Oh, my God.

01:11:39.414 --> 01:11:41.439
What!

01:11:41.616 --> 01:11:43.379
I have one.

01:11:43.885 --> 01:11:44.977
What!

01:11:45.153 --> 01:11:47.644
<i>I have zikpah.</i>

01:11:47.822 --> 01:11:49.016
Look at it.

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:53.089
It is you.

01:11:53.862 --> 01:11:57.923
Dalia, I don't know how to tell you this.
I cannot make sticky with anyone else.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.901
You are the special one.

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.528
I will only be stiff for you.

01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:08.365
Who is Steve!

01:12:08.543 --> 01:12:10.943
Stiff, with an F.

01:12:13.448 --> 01:12:16.076
- Stiff. Stiff.
- Yes.

01:12:16.685 --> 01:12:18.277
Okay...

01:12:18.453 --> 01:12:22.446
...I know you meant that
in a good way...

01:12:22.624 --> 01:12:23.852
The best of ways.

01:12:24.025 --> 01:12:26.459
- so thank you.

01:12:26.628 --> 01:12:28.755
Thank you.

01:12:30.098 --> 01:12:31.725
Is crazy.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:35.199
This has never happened.

01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:36.962
One woman...

01:12:37.138 --> 01:12:39.333
<i>...one zikpah...</i>

01:12:39.507 --> 01:12:41.202
...one life.

01:13:04.566 --> 01:13:07.694
You see his face!
Scared Israeli son of bitch.

01:13:07.869 --> 01:13:09.837
Salim, this is not bomb.

01:13:10.004 --> 01:13:11.369
What you mean "not bomb"!

01:13:11.539 --> 01:13:14.167
It's grade A liquid nitrogen.

01:13:14.342 --> 01:13:16.037
Guys, I really need to go home.

01:13:16.211 --> 01:13:18.372
Inaz have a soccer match
in the morning.

01:13:18.546 --> 01:13:22.038
- I am hero.
- Salim, this not bomb. It just go:

01:13:22.217 --> 01:13:24.014
Well, just go with it.

01:13:26.154 --> 01:13:27.781
I scraped some off the window.

01:13:28.456 --> 01:13:29.753
Maybe you know what is!

01:13:35.563 --> 01:13:40.023
It's Neosporin, it's nothing.
I use it for cuts and genital sores.

01:13:43.238 --> 01:13:45.934
We're beginning to think
maybe someone out to get the Zo...

01:13:46.107 --> 01:13:47.938
The Scrappy.

01:13:48.109 --> 01:13:51.704
You mean like a competing salon!
That's heavy.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.781
Don't be afraid, honey.
Don't be afraid.

01:13:54.949 --> 01:13:56.678
Well, I...

01:13:58.186 --> 01:14:00.882
Yeah, lick this.
No, she likes the tongue in the ear.

01:14:01.055 --> 01:14:03.080
Oh, I like that bet... Oh, I like that.

01:14:03.258 --> 01:14:05.351
<i>Close with the brenski.</i>

01:14:07.762 --> 01:14:10.162
Come on, get some saliva
on those bad boys.

01:14:10.331 --> 01:14:12.492
- She likes it, huh!
- Of course she likes it.

01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:13.998
Okay.

01:14:14.169 --> 01:14:17.229
I could look for clues. It's my shift
for community night watch.

01:14:17.405 --> 01:14:19.134
The what!
The communism tight crotch!

01:14:19.307 --> 01:14:21.275
Oh, it's the community
night watch program.

01:14:21.442 --> 01:14:25.310
You know, people in the neighborhood
patrolling it, keeping it safe.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:27.243
We kick some ass.

01:14:27.415 --> 01:14:30.350
Hey, why don't you let Scrappy Coco
take your shift tonight!

01:14:30.518 --> 01:14:32.918
- I bet he'd be good at this.
- Oori.

01:14:33.521 --> 01:14:35.489
What! For clues.

01:14:35.657 --> 01:14:40.253
I know it sounds scary, Scrappy,
but you are gonna be just fine.

01:14:41.129 --> 01:14:43.256
Maybe I can manage one night.

01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:45.160
Maybe you can pretzel some people.

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:48.359
- Thank you for getting the hummus.
- The hummus.

01:14:49.003 --> 01:14:50.493
Where's Patches!

01:14:50.672 --> 01:14:52.435
Patches.

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:59.002
I'm terrified right now.
I'm totally terrified.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:01.478
"Shitting my pants"
doesn't come close.

01:15:01.649 --> 01:15:03.742
I wish I was shitting my pants.

01:15:03.918 --> 01:15:05.783
It's just a patrol.

01:15:05.954 --> 01:15:07.251
What if something goes down!

01:15:07.422 --> 01:15:09.617
I don't know if I'd have the courage.

01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:12.555
What if something goes down
and someone got killed!

01:15:12.727 --> 01:15:16.219
I would have to live with that.
I'd be happier shitting my pants.

01:15:16.397 --> 01:15:17.694
Much happier.

01:15:21.769 --> 01:15:23.930
- Let's go.
- We're supposed to call the police.

01:15:24.105 --> 01:15:25.197
No. No time.

01:15:25.373 --> 01:15:27.273
No, no. No. It's good.

01:15:30.378 --> 01:15:31.402
Drop the paint.

01:15:32.814 --> 01:15:35.908
Get out of here, Ahab,
or I'll cut your eyes out.

01:15:36.084 --> 01:15:38.552
- Maybe we should let him finish.
- No, no, no.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.484
What you cut my eyes out with!
The Neosporin!

01:15:44.492 --> 01:15:46.221
My blade, camel jockey.

01:15:46.394 --> 01:15:49.795
My friend, the beating I give you
if you stop the spraying...

01:15:49.964 --> 01:15:53.456
...is much less than the beating
I give you if you try to cut me.

01:15:57.772 --> 01:15:59.069
What are you laughing at!

01:15:59.941 --> 01:16:02.637
That was just with everyone.

01:16:13.454 --> 01:16:15.115
They had it coming to them, right!

01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:17.520
Yeah. Yeah, it seemed like it. Yeah.

01:16:17.692 --> 01:16:21.492
- Okay, you take it from here.
- I got it.

01:16:21.663 --> 01:16:23.028
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:16:26.467 --> 01:16:28.697
What you gotta say about that, huh!

01:16:32.974 --> 01:16:35.374
You're telling me
our guys can't handle...

01:16:35.543 --> 01:16:38.774
...some neighborhood
night-watching losers!

01:16:38.947 --> 01:16:41.814
We can't even put a scare
into these people!

01:16:41.983 --> 01:16:43.712
The main guy who got in the way...

01:16:43.885 --> 01:16:47.048
...is the same one who's bringing
old biddies into Rafaela Salon.

01:16:47.221 --> 01:16:48.415
My aunt goes there.

01:16:48.589 --> 01:16:51.990
She says besides the sex,
the guy gives a pretty good haircut.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.287
Don't talk to me about that dump.

01:16:54.462 --> 01:16:58.956
I've got a huge,
classy hotel standing there...

01:16:59.133 --> 01:17:01.658
...and it's staring
at that cheap garbage.

01:17:01.836 --> 01:17:04.168
I want it staring at the Supercuts.

01:17:04.339 --> 01:17:10.141
Now, has anyone made any headway
with any of these foreign people!

01:17:10.311 --> 01:17:13.371
I spoke to the manager of Going
Out Of Business again yesterday.

01:17:13.548 --> 01:17:16.176
I stated our price
and the urgency of the matter...

01:17:16.351 --> 01:17:19.343
...and he offered me two-thirds less
and a Toshiba DVD player.

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.080
The people at Everything Must Go
were just as difficult.

01:17:22.256 --> 01:17:25.555
They offered me a Blu-ray disc
and a jar of hummus.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.152
What's hummus!

01:17:27.328 --> 01:17:29.228
It's a very tasty...

01:17:29.397 --> 01:17:30.864
...diarrhea-like substance.

01:17:31.032 --> 01:17:33.330
Grant Walbridge has a vision.

01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:37.801
A vision for Lower Manhattan
to have the first indoor mall...

01:17:37.972 --> 01:17:41.203
...with its own 300-foot
roller coaster.

01:17:41.376 --> 01:17:44.709
You know, you're lucky I have
a world-class superhot girlfriend...

01:17:44.879 --> 01:17:48.713
...with a perfectly proportioned
ass-to-breast ratio...

01:17:48.883 --> 01:17:50.748
...or I'd be furious.

01:17:50.918 --> 01:17:52.909
She is smoking, sir.

01:17:53.087 --> 01:17:54.952
I'd pay
to spend an hour with her, sir.

01:17:55.123 --> 01:17:56.385
Let me in on that.

01:17:56.557 --> 01:17:58.115
Well, thank you.

01:17:58.292 --> 01:18:04.356
But if you bitches
can't get those people out...

01:18:04.532 --> 01:18:07.262
...I will find other people
who will get the job done.

01:18:07.435 --> 01:18:10.199
However, whenever.

01:18:11.439 --> 01:18:16.775
Walbridge!

01:18:24.118 --> 01:18:25.483
This is where I find them.

01:18:25.653 --> 01:18:28.918
But I don't know if it's same people
who try to Neosporin salon.

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:32.958
But you caught them writing this crap,
so, what do you do!

01:18:35.129 --> 01:18:37.962
- You don't mess with the Zohan.
- Check it.

01:18:38.132 --> 01:18:39.121
- Disco.
- Disco.

01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.289
- Good.
- Good.

01:18:40.468 --> 01:18:42.959
Why did you do this
to Naseef's store, huh!

01:18:43.137 --> 01:18:44.604
Why you blame the Israelis!

01:18:44.772 --> 01:18:46.672
We come to work,
go out of business.

01:18:46.841 --> 01:18:49.708
No, no, no.
Is not Israeli who do this.

01:18:49.877 --> 01:18:52.641
I do community watch.
Don't worry, it's all taken care of.

01:18:52.814 --> 01:18:56.181
Not Israeli! Who else would write
"Arab go home"!

01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:59.877
Oh, I don't know,
just maybe 99 percent of the world.

01:19:00.755 --> 01:19:02.746
- You see what he says!
- That was joke.

01:19:02.924 --> 01:19:06.587
Come on, come on.
You guys get along here, stop this.

01:19:06.761 --> 01:19:10.857
Yeah, here it's okay. It's just there,
the war is never going to end.

01:19:11.532 --> 01:19:14.899
You know, we were so close to peace
before the asshole shot Rabin.

01:19:16.037 --> 01:19:17.402
Bush, he see the big picture.

01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:20.006
Bush no want peace,
he set it all back.

01:19:20.174 --> 01:19:23.610
What about Bush's wife!
This is a wife I would get sticky with.

01:19:23.778 --> 01:19:25.905
I would do this. I would do this.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.776
- Yes, yes.
- What about Clinton! I would do Hillary.

01:19:30.685 --> 01:19:31.879
The big legs.

01:19:32.053 --> 01:19:34.988
Yeah, she look strict,
like she's going to teach me a lesson.

01:19:35.156 --> 01:19:37.317
- Yes, discipline.
- You know what's funny!

01:19:37.492 --> 01:19:39.255
I like Chelsea.

01:19:39.427 --> 01:19:41.019
You're crazy.

01:19:42.363 --> 01:19:43.921
She has beautiful legs.

01:19:44.899 --> 01:19:48.892
If I want legs, I'll take Obama's wife.
She has legs.

01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:51.129
This is what happens
when they talk politics.

01:19:51.305 --> 01:19:53.205
No, no, no, wife of McCain!

01:19:53.374 --> 01:19:56.605
She has the ass,
and you know she's not getting any.

01:19:57.812 --> 01:20:02.215
I understand my assistant
explained the job to you.

01:20:02.383 --> 01:20:05.045
He told us. You wanna get
some people out your building...

01:20:05.219 --> 01:20:08.154
...so you can build
some kind of roller coaster mall.

01:20:08.322 --> 01:20:11.553
Sir, I just wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

01:20:11.726 --> 01:20:15.890
I mean, it's a gift to mess with the Jews
and the terrorists on the same night.

01:20:16.063 --> 01:20:17.394
I mean, it's like...

01:20:17.565 --> 01:20:20.466
- It's like...
- Christmas in July.

01:20:20.635 --> 01:20:22.500
It's like Christmas in July.

01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:25.639
<i>Right now
we are scheduled to sabotage...</i>

01:20:25.806 --> 01:20:28.673
<i>... a black peoples' parade
in Chicago...</i>

01:20:28.843 --> 01:20:31.073
...but we can move that.

01:20:31.245 --> 01:20:34.681
Well, I'm not really quite sure
how you move a parade.

01:20:34.849 --> 01:20:37.340
That's easy, it's just a phone call.

01:20:38.019 --> 01:20:41.352
Well, we'll be calling back
to make the arrangements.

01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:45.424
Can I just say that I don't like
most rich people, but you get it.

01:20:45.593 --> 01:20:48.084
<i>We built this country
on the right to bear arms.</i>

01:20:48.262 --> 01:20:52.164
Now they're trying to tell me how many
bullets my gun can shoot per second.

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:56.064
They're trying to tell me
whether I can stockpile weapons...

01:20:56.237 --> 01:20:57.932
...in the shed behind my house.

01:20:58.105 --> 01:21:00.699
- Right, by God.
- Anyway, you're a rich guy that gets it.

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:03.139
You and Mel Gibson.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:09.107
Mel Gibson. Not too shabby.

01:21:11.586 --> 01:21:13.611
<i>Welcome to Hezbollah
customer service.</i>

01:21:13.788 --> 01:21:15.221
<i>All lines are busy now.</i>

01:21:15.389 --> 01:21:20.656
<i>Your call will be received
in... minutes.</i>

01:21:21.429 --> 01:21:23.659
Come on with this.
How we find Phantom!

01:21:23.831 --> 01:21:27.130
<i>Well, he probably hang

01:21:27.301 --> 01:21:29.826
Okay, but which!
He have, like, 200.

01:21:30.004 --> 01:21:31.198
Probably in Amman.

01:21:31.372 --> 01:21:33.567
<i>In downtown
he get the hottest poochibaba.</i>

01:21:39.747 --> 01:21:42.511
What's the area code of Amman!

01:22:23.524 --> 01:22:24.923
Hello. Phantom Muchentuchen.

01:22:25.092 --> 01:22:27.652
Yes. I want speak Phantom.

01:22:27.828 --> 01:22:29.762
What say! No English.

01:22:30.164 --> 01:22:31.654
Idiot.

01:22:31.832 --> 01:22:34.300
Want speak to Phantom.

01:22:34.468 --> 01:22:37.369
No, no, no. Phantom not here.

01:22:37.538 --> 01:22:40.905
Yeah, yeah, I know.
But Phantom no come!

01:22:41.075 --> 01:22:42.667
<i>But what about for poonibaba!</i>

01:22:42.843 --> 01:22:46.244
<i>No, no, poonibaba at store
on 3rd and Lachalta.</i>

01:22:46.414 --> 01:22:48.974
Oh, okay. So you have number
for store!

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:50.777
You call information.

01:22:50.951 --> 01:22:53.385
You don't have number
for other store!

01:22:55.823 --> 01:22:57.222
It's somewhere. I don't know.

01:22:57.391 --> 01:23:03.330
Come on, get number! I calling from
America, fry bitch! I very important.

01:23:03.497 --> 01:23:05.328

01:23:05.499 --> 01:23:08.627
When she is grown up
she will understand!

01:23:10.237 --> 01:23:11.932
Hello.

01:23:14.041 --> 01:23:17.306
I find the Zohan.
You not kill the Zohan.

01:23:17.478 --> 01:23:19.070
I kill the Zohan.

01:23:19.246 --> 01:23:22.113
No, you did not.
I find him in America.

01:23:22.283 --> 01:23:24.877
I prove. I send you picture on cell.

01:23:25.519 --> 01:23:27.282
Okay. Bring this.

01:23:27.455 --> 01:23:28.649
I am bringing.

01:23:35.062 --> 01:23:36.086
<i>You see?</i>

01:23:36.263 --> 01:23:39.790
But the hairstyle, it is hideous.

01:23:39.967 --> 01:23:41.059
This is same Zohan.

01:23:41.235 --> 01:23:44.227
<i>What he thinking! He look like guy
from Who's the Boss?</i>

01:23:44.405 --> 01:23:46.669
Look, this is same Zohan.

01:23:46.841 --> 01:23:51.141
Everybody think you big hero.
But I tell everyone you not big hero.

01:23:51.312 --> 01:23:53.280
Okay, okay, okay!
What you want, huh!

01:23:53.447 --> 01:23:55.972
<i>I want muchentuchen
restaurant chain.</i>

01:23:56.150 --> 01:23:57.310
No.

01:23:57.485 --> 01:24:00.181
But if I tell,
you no have chain anyway.

01:24:00.354 --> 01:24:02.618
So you not give any incentive.

01:24:03.991 --> 01:24:06.926
<i>Okay. I want 50 percent
of muchentuchen chain.</i>

01:24:07.094 --> 01:24:10.495
<i>- Phantom & Salim Muchentuchen.

01:24:10.664 --> 01:24:12.291
- Twenty-five percent.
- No.

01:24:12.466 --> 01:24:15.458
I want yogurt shop attached to store,
like food court.

01:24:15.936 --> 01:24:16.960
Okay.

01:24:17.138 --> 01:24:19.038
- I get profits from store.
- No.

01:24:19.206 --> 01:24:20.696
- Some profits.
- No.

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:22.843
I get free yogurt
when I come to store.

01:24:23.544 --> 01:24:25.307
Okay. Within reason.

01:24:25.479 --> 01:24:27.003
And I want some of your wives.

01:24:27.448 --> 01:24:28.779
<i>How many wives you want?</i>

01:24:28.949 --> 01:24:30.280
- Twenty.
- No.

01:24:30.451 --> 01:24:32.282
- I sleep with one wife.
- No.

01:24:32.453 --> 01:24:34.284
She give one pee-pee touch.

01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:36.213
Okay.

01:24:53.674 --> 01:24:56.734
My friends, look what I do.
I hook you all up with tickets.

01:24:56.911 --> 01:24:59.675
This Walbridge guy's
trying to kiss salon's ass...

01:24:59.847 --> 01:25:02.543
...so he give me 20 tickets
hackyside.

01:25:02.716 --> 01:25:06.675
Very nice. Hassan, you see this!

01:25:07.688 --> 01:25:10.885
This is where you're going to be
when Israel kick your ass.

01:25:11.058 --> 01:25:14.357
Yes! No, you're gonna give it up
like you give up Gaza Strip, huh!

01:25:16.397 --> 01:25:18.365
Excuse us.

01:25:20.201 --> 01:25:21.293
I have to show you this.

01:25:21.469 --> 01:25:25.064
Listen to Fatima Zaad's
gossip column on Page Nine.

01:25:25.239 --> 01:25:28.333
"A hall of fame terrorist
is visiting New York...

01:25:28.509 --> 01:25:30.841
<i>...and not for the muchentuchen."</i>

01:25:31.545 --> 01:25:34.275
- Phantom's coming to the City!
- There's more.

01:25:34.448 --> 01:25:38.612
"He's coming to hacky sack
a certain scrappy Israeli...

01:25:38.786 --> 01:25:43.018
...who says he cuts hair,
but really cuts terrorist."

01:25:44.658 --> 01:25:45.920
He's ruined everything.

01:25:46.093 --> 01:25:48.391
Why you say! You the Zohan.

01:25:48.562 --> 01:25:51.053
He come to hacky sack,
you take him out.

01:25:51.232 --> 01:25:53.757
No, I don't care.
I come here to start new life.

01:25:53.934 --> 01:25:56.835
Get new woman to love
and make the bang-boom.

01:25:57.004 --> 01:25:59.234
Now my life's followed me here.

01:26:08.082 --> 01:26:10.915
Maybe Phantom no care anymore.

01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:08.465
You're an Israeli counterterrorist!

01:27:08.642 --> 01:27:10.041
- I knew it.
- What!

01:27:10.210 --> 01:27:13.509
Well, the Israeli part.
Because he's circumcised.

01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:17.348
How is Dalia going to forgive me!

01:27:17.518 --> 01:27:18.917
I'm liar.

01:27:19.086 --> 01:27:22.021
She Palestinian, I'm no Australian.

01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:25.124
You know, Scrappy...
I mean, "Zohard."

01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:28.318
- if there's one thing I've learned
from all my relationships...

01:27:28.495 --> 01:27:32.625
...with Jewish men, Puerto Rican men,
aborigines...

01:27:34.301 --> 01:27:37.270
...you can't have secrets
in a relationship.

01:27:37.438 --> 01:27:42.239
You tell her the truth
and if she really is this special one...

01:27:42.409 --> 01:27:45.071
...everything will work out just fine.

01:27:45.813 --> 01:27:47.906
I like this.

01:27:52.918 --> 01:27:56.979
I am sorry I not tell you the truth before
I make you fall head over tits for me.

01:27:57.155 --> 01:28:01.182
But believe me,
I am wanting you even more.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:04.924
I know you're not from
where you say.

01:28:05.096 --> 01:28:07.189
I see how you look
at the Fizzy Bubblech.

01:28:07.365 --> 01:28:11.392
Then why you like this! Is it because
I Israel and you Palestine!

01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:13.094
Come on, tell me in my face.

01:28:13.271 --> 01:28:16.707
Zohan, you're not just Israel.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.775
You Israel.

01:28:18.944 --> 01:28:20.912
But you say hate is stupid.

01:28:21.079 --> 01:28:24.879
That's why you run to America, to get
away from the hate and the fighting.

01:28:25.483 --> 01:28:28.577
I was even thinking
we let all this cool down...

01:28:28.753 --> 01:28:30.721
...I go out and get us
a house over there.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.483
We move in together,
we cut the hair...

01:28:33.658 --> 01:28:36.422
...make the children,
cut the children's hair.

01:28:36.595 --> 01:28:38.961
Zohan, I can't.

01:28:39.831 --> 01:28:43.426
I have open mind,
but you Israeli counterterrorist.

01:28:43.602 --> 01:28:45.297
No, no, no. I no do this anymore.

01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:48.200
You put the fork in the fat lady,
it's over.

01:28:48.373 --> 01:28:50.534
She's had enough to eat.
This is a promise.

01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:53.200
It doesn't matter.

01:28:53.378 --> 01:28:55.471
You don't know my family.

01:28:55.647 --> 01:28:58.115
Or maybe you do.

01:28:58.283 --> 01:28:59.545
What does this mean!

01:29:00.785 --> 01:29:02.548
Just leave.

01:29:02.721 --> 01:29:04.655
Please, it can't be.

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.426
Maybe is for best.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:15.392
You deserve a safe life.

01:29:16.735 --> 01:29:18.896
But know...

01:29:19.838 --> 01:29:23.069
...you will always be my special one.

01:29:34.686 --> 01:29:36.779
- Zohan.
- Dalia.

01:29:39.424 --> 01:29:40.857
I got you a gift.

01:29:41.026 --> 01:29:43.153
A gift.

01:29:46.931 --> 01:29:49.422
They come out with new book!

01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:54.436
Yes. They do it
every 21 years, I think.

01:29:54.606 --> 01:29:56.801
Just a slight update from yours.

01:30:02.514 --> 01:30:04.505
No feathering!

01:30:04.683 --> 01:30:05.980
Or scrunching!

01:30:06.718 --> 01:30:08.015
Where's the style!

01:30:09.054 --> 01:30:13.787
But I know this is nice gesture.
Thank you.

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.687
Goodbye, Zohan.

01:30:16.861 --> 01:30:19.091
Goodbye.

01:30:25.537 --> 01:30:27.630
Goodbye.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:54.358
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

01:30:54.532 --> 01:30:56.022
Me too.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:57.463
You still go to Hacky Sack!

01:30:57.635 --> 01:31:00.604
Yes, it's better I find him
than he finds me, huh!

01:31:00.772 --> 01:31:03.832
I got your back.
I get you best army guys in city.

01:31:04.008 --> 01:31:06.977
No, no, no. I handle this alone.

01:31:16.955 --> 01:31:18.752
Hello! Let's go.

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:39.543
Go. Go, go, go.

01:32:04.636 --> 01:32:09.073
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are your Israeli Blue Stars...</i>

01:32:09.240 --> 01:32:13.404
<i>... and your Lebanese Trees!</i>

01:32:25.089 --> 01:32:27.319
Fizzy Bubblech.

01:32:39.904 --> 01:32:42.395
What's with the cheers!
Wasn't that guy a terrorist!

01:32:42.574 --> 01:32:45.065
Yeah, people used to boo
you too, John, you remember!

01:32:45.243 --> 01:32:46.767
I wasn't a terrorist.

01:32:46.945 --> 01:32:49.209
You were pretty bad.

01:32:51.216 --> 01:32:55.175
I brought this great event
to New York to tell the world...

01:32:55.353 --> 01:32:57.321
...that New York City...

01:32:57.489 --> 01:33:01.721
...loves its foreign immigrant-types
from the Middle East.

01:33:02.861 --> 01:33:07.594
My hot girlfriend and I
know that we can all get along...

01:33:07.765 --> 01:33:13.226
...whether you're white, or brown,
or khaki, whatever that color is.

01:33:13.404 --> 01:33:17.738
And here to sing
the American national anthem...

01:33:17.909 --> 01:33:20.377
...a superstar we all love:

01:33:20.545 --> 01:33:22.775
Mariah Carey!

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:50.664
<i>Goal!</i>

01:33:50.842 --> 01:33:53.106
<i>And disco break!</i>

01:34:08.293 --> 01:34:11.626
<i>Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!</i>

01:34:11.796 --> 01:34:15.664
<i>Disco, disco, good, good!
Disco, disco, good, good!</i>

01:34:17.869 --> 01:34:19.666
Okay, Mariah. Couple more.

01:34:19.837 --> 01:34:22.635
This one's from Sheik Fayalah
of Lebanon.

01:34:22.807 --> 01:34:25.298
He wants you to write
"All I want for Ramadan is you."

01:34:25.476 --> 01:34:26.636
Okay, this again!

01:34:26.811 --> 01:34:27.971
- I know.
- All right.

01:34:28.146 --> 01:34:30.171
MC, there's a Mr. Phantom
here to see you.

01:34:30.348 --> 01:34:32.475
Who's Phantom,
a dude trying to be a rapper!

01:34:32.650 --> 01:34:35.710
- Because I don't know who that is.
- He says he's a killing machine.

01:34:36.454 --> 01:34:38.149
Whatever. Okay.

01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:42.722
Miss Mariah Carey.

01:34:44.062 --> 01:34:47.031
It is a pleasure to meet you.

01:34:47.198 --> 01:34:50.759
Thank you. Nice to meet you.
Hi, how are you!

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:54.393
Miss Carey, your high notes
are so beautiful...

01:34:54.572 --> 01:34:58.975
...like a Scud missile
soaring towards its target.

01:34:59.677 --> 01:35:01.975
- Thank you. That's really nice.
- Thank you.

01:35:02.146 --> 01:35:03.841
So you know I'm not dead.

01:35:05.483 --> 01:35:07.713
Oh, I sorry I startle.

01:35:07.885 --> 01:35:11.753
I was not startle. I saw a bee.

01:35:11.923 --> 01:35:14.391
There's a bee! I'm allergic.
It's not even funny.

01:35:14.559 --> 01:35:17.050
No, no, no. Look.
The bee is gone. He's gone.

01:35:17.228 --> 01:35:19.492
Mariah, believe me, there's no bee.

01:35:19.664 --> 01:35:21.529
I'm allergic. You know I'm allergic.

01:35:21.699 --> 01:35:26.500
No, no, no. The bee... Forget the bee.
The bee is made up, it's fiction.

01:35:26.671 --> 01:35:29.003
It was a black wasp.

01:35:29.173 --> 01:35:31.164
- promising me
that there was no bee here.

01:35:31.342 --> 01:35:33.037
There was no bee. He says the bee...

01:35:33.211 --> 01:35:36.442
...so he can look more like a person
who would not scream like this.

01:35:36.614 --> 01:35:38.912
- Are you sure!
- I promise you.

01:35:39.083 --> 01:35:40.414
I beg your cleavage's pardon.

01:35:40.585 --> 01:35:45.022
We will be out of your bouncy hair
in a jiffy. Is between us.

01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:47.851
I was going to kill you tomorrow...

01:35:48.026 --> 01:35:54.431
...but I guess jackass
can't wait to die for real.

01:35:54.599 --> 01:35:56.260
Do y'all want us to leave!
Because we can go.

01:35:56.434 --> 01:35:58.095
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

01:35:58.269 --> 01:36:00.965
- We are not even here.
- Almost done. Give it a few seconds.

01:36:03.041 --> 01:36:05.509
I came here to the States to
stop the fighting...

01:36:05.677 --> 01:36:07.702
...but I guess
this will never end, eh!

01:36:08.813 --> 01:36:12.579
Oh, Zohan does not want
to fight anymore.

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:14.240
Scared of bees, huh!

01:36:14.419 --> 01:36:17.616
Now I'm afraid of the bees!
I'm afraid of the bees!

01:36:17.789 --> 01:36:19.916
What! You're the one that
brings up the bees.

01:36:21.159 --> 01:36:23.684
Your hair. Your hair does not
do you justice.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:26.159
You don't like this hair!
I think you're alone on this one.

01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:27.797
Everyone else
going crazy for it.

01:36:27.965 --> 01:36:30.456
I like the 'fro better.

01:36:30.635 --> 01:36:31.932
Hang on, I'm getting a call.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:35.130
Michael, what is!

01:36:35.306 --> 01:36:37.467
<i>Zohan? We have a problem here.</i>

01:36:37.642 --> 01:36:40.304
- Where you get that!
- This is a Sony Ericsson.

01:36:40.478 --> 01:36:42.912
- It has Bluetooth!
- Of course it has Bluetooth.

01:36:43.081 --> 01:36:45.413
I can never figure that
Bluetooth shit out, though.

01:36:45.583 --> 01:36:48.177
Oh, no, it's very simple.
You sync it to your PowerBook.

01:36:48.352 --> 01:36:50.980
- Tell her. Phantom will tell you.
- Mac or PC!

01:36:51.656 --> 01:36:53.817
- Mac.
- You have MySpace!

01:36:53.991 --> 01:36:56.221
The record company does.
It's not really mine.

01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:59.363
Please, add me as a friend.

01:37:00.164 --> 01:37:01.188
Sure, yeah, yeah.

01:37:01.365 --> 01:37:04.357
Sure, as Huge Boner.
We'll add you tomorrow.

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:05.661
Michael, what is!

01:37:05.837 --> 01:37:12.003
There's a bunch of guys and they are
lighting fires and it's getting pretty bad.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:16.403
No. Stay where you are.

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:18.071
<i>Yeah, we'll stay up here.</i>

01:37:18.616 --> 01:37:20.880
- What! Where you go!
- I have bigger fish to swim.

01:37:21.052 --> 01:37:23.816
- Mariah, I love the newest album.
- Thank you.

01:37:47.645 --> 01:37:50.170
The Zohan.

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:54.846
My pita shop.

01:37:56.788 --> 01:37:58.016
They burned it down.

01:38:11.402 --> 01:38:12.733
Why you do this!

01:38:12.904 --> 01:38:15.532
We no do this. We at Hacky Sack
as much as the next guy.

01:38:15.706 --> 01:38:19.472
And I wish that we should do this,
after you write that shit on my wall.

01:38:21.479 --> 01:38:23.037
Across street!

01:38:23.214 --> 01:38:25.739
- Waleed, Waleed. Look, Waleed!
- No. My store.

01:38:25.917 --> 01:38:30.081
You people ruined my store.
You people ruined my store!

01:38:35.293 --> 01:38:37.488
What I miss!
I was stuck on West Broadway.

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:40.290
The Israeli burned down my store!

01:38:40.464 --> 01:38:41.761
No, no, no.

01:38:41.933 --> 01:38:43.696
I save store.

01:38:43.868 --> 01:38:46.462
Then I kill the Zohan.

01:38:48.906 --> 01:38:51.431
Phantom, kick its ass.

01:38:51.609 --> 01:38:52.940
Jab it to the right.

01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:54.975
Stick and move, Phantom.
Stick and move.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:58.171
He can't do this alone.

01:39:01.619 --> 01:39:03.018
Don't back down. Kick its ass.

01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:28.378
Phantom.

01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:33.514
Why you help me!

01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.248
Because I'm through with this.

01:39:37.421 --> 01:39:38.718
I no more fight.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:43.557
You do whatever you want,
but I no fight back.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:46.556
It's trick, huh!

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:47.857
No.

01:39:50.601 --> 01:39:53.069
- Fight back.
- No.

01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:56.229
- Fight back!
- No.

01:39:57.842 --> 01:39:58.968
Fight back, Zohan.

01:39:59.143 --> 01:40:01.373
Fight him back. What are you doing!
Fight back.

01:40:03.514 --> 01:40:04.572
No.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:08.014
This is not fun for anybody.

01:40:08.185 --> 01:40:09.550
Why you not fight back!

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.383
Because he know better.
He show you he change.

01:40:13.791 --> 01:40:14.815
Sister!

01:40:14.992 --> 01:40:16.983
When you gonna grow up, Fatoush!

01:40:17.161 --> 01:40:18.355
Fatoush!

01:40:18.529 --> 01:40:21.191
No, no, no Fatoush.

01:40:21.365 --> 01:40:24.892
Is Phantom now.
And is my business.

01:40:25.069 --> 01:40:27.697
Is my man, Fatoush.

01:40:27.872 --> 01:40:29.339
You're my woman!

01:40:29.507 --> 01:40:31.031
You Phantom's sister!

01:40:31.208 --> 01:40:33.108
You tapping the Zohan!

01:40:33.644 --> 01:40:35.475
You settle for a pee-pee touch!

01:40:35.646 --> 01:40:38.877
I wouldn't say "settle."
It was negotiation.

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:40.278
Fatoush is talking.

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:44.949
Yes. I am Phantom's sister.

01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:50.224
And, no, Fatoush,
I am not tapping the Zohan.

01:40:50.394 --> 01:40:54.296
But I think I love him.

01:40:56.767 --> 01:40:58.098
This is good.

01:40:58.269 --> 01:41:00.931
Of course you love me.
I'm very good man.

01:41:04.675 --> 01:41:08.076
Brother, here in America
we're the same.

01:41:08.245 --> 01:41:12.113
We just people trying to get jobs
cutting hair, driving cabs...

01:41:12.283 --> 01:41:14.274
...selling crappy stereo equipment.

01:41:14.452 --> 01:41:16.545
- Hey. Is Sony guts.
- Whatever.

01:41:16.721 --> 01:41:21.749
The point is, we are thousands
of miles away from all this hate...

01:41:21.926 --> 01:41:24.588
...and we live together just fine.

01:41:24.762 --> 01:41:26.320
We do.

01:41:27.932 --> 01:41:29.092
We do.

01:41:29.266 --> 01:41:34.169
Come on, people.
Where is the hate! Anyone!

01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:36.503
- I resent.
- Resent is good.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:37.971
What! What do you resent!

01:41:38.142 --> 01:41:39.234
People don't like us.

01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:42.504
Come on, is not easy for us.
People don't like us too.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:46.309
- Why!
- Because they think we are you.

01:41:47.785 --> 01:41:50.151
We do look alike.
You got to admit this. Come on.

01:41:51.088 --> 01:41:53.682
Waleed looks Mexican, to be honest.

01:41:54.892 --> 01:41:56.120
Yeah, he do.

01:41:57.795 --> 01:41:59.854
You know, ever since
the stupid terrorists...

01:42:00.031 --> 01:42:01.794
...everyone think we are terrorists.

01:42:01.966 --> 01:42:03.866
Look, Bashir, no offense...

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:07.266
...but if you sat next to me on a plane,
I might want to get off too.

01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:11.435
He's right.

01:42:11.609 --> 01:42:16.046
But how could I not hate
when you stole my goat!

01:42:16.881 --> 01:42:19.372
I am sorry about your goat.

01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:23.384
He was a good goat.
I treat him like member of the family.

01:42:24.922 --> 01:42:27.390
- Really!
- Yes.

01:42:27.558 --> 01:42:30.618
Did you rub his chin!

01:42:30.795 --> 01:42:32.763
Like this!

01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:36.889
Yes, sometimes for hours.
He would make face if I stop.

01:42:37.068 --> 01:42:38.558
He make the face!

01:42:38.736 --> 01:42:41.603
Oh, the face. The face.

01:42:41.772 --> 01:42:44.297
That's it, that's it.
That looks just like him.

01:42:44.475 --> 01:42:48.138
As long as he was happy.

01:42:48.312 --> 01:42:49.904
Is good. Very happy.

01:42:52.817 --> 01:42:54.682
<i>Holy shichumetz.</i>

01:42:54.852 --> 01:42:56.479
I see what is.

01:42:59.889 --> 01:43:01.584
Those are cool. Who make this!

01:43:28.952 --> 01:43:32.080
You see this! Bastard landlord.

01:43:32.255 --> 01:43:33.654
He tell us go to Hacky Sack...

01:43:33.823 --> 01:43:36.485
...so he can make it look like
we burn each other's store.

01:43:36.659 --> 01:43:38.854
To make us look like we enemies.

01:43:39.028 --> 01:43:40.552
This the real enemy.

01:43:41.664 --> 01:43:44.030
I thought the whole place
was going down.

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.531
Oh, we're waiting on them, sir.

01:43:45.702 --> 01:43:51.698
We're drawing them closer,
like a fat queer to a dick sandwich.

01:43:53.376 --> 01:43:55.071
Aharon, get weapons from truck.

01:43:55.245 --> 01:43:57.372
No, no, no.
I wanna minimize collateral damage.

01:43:57.547 --> 01:43:59.412
- I do this alone.
- I do this alone.

01:43:59.582 --> 01:44:01.482
- We do this together.
- I go myself.

01:44:01.651 --> 01:44:05.644
No, no, no. Listen.
Come on, already, big guy.

01:44:05.822 --> 01:44:07.983
Let it go.
We're on the same side, here.

01:44:08.158 --> 01:44:10.023
Don't "big guy" me, big guy.

01:44:10.193 --> 01:44:12.559
Look, you think I didn't want
to run like you did!

01:44:12.729 --> 01:44:14.856
- Is no pressure here.
- What!

01:44:15.031 --> 01:44:20.128
Listen, all I ever wanted since high
school was to go to States and...

01:44:20.303 --> 01:44:23.568
- What!
- This hard to say.

01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:25.833
Tell me, what is!

01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:29.141
And sell shoes.

01:44:29.312 --> 01:44:31.007
I love shoes.

01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:34.947
No. That's great. I love to cut hair.

01:44:35.118 --> 01:44:36.779
There is nothing wrong with that.

01:44:36.953 --> 01:44:38.284
- Tell my parents.
- I hear you.

01:44:38.455 --> 01:44:41.356
- They don't understand.
- Parents, they never do, huh!

01:44:41.524 --> 01:44:44.891
- Never do. They think they're clever...
- You guys going, or what!

01:44:45.428 --> 01:44:47.259
- Yes. Okay, we go.
- Yes. We go.

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:48.761
Come on, let's go.

01:44:48.932 --> 01:44:50.627
Soup's on, boys.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.631
Hell, yeah!

01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:58.939
What kind of shoes you like!

01:44:59.108 --> 01:45:01.804
You know, Rockport, Ferragamo,
the classics.

01:45:07.283 --> 01:45:10.309
You should maybe try
Hugo Boss, huh!

01:45:10.487 --> 01:45:12.614
No, no, no.
They always cover the toes.

01:45:12.789 --> 01:45:14.814
You stylist,
you buy some style shoes.

01:45:14.991 --> 01:45:18.154
Oh, yes, but I'm looking
for function too.

01:45:18.328 --> 01:45:21.320
Try mine. It's Kenneth Cole.

01:45:21.498 --> 01:45:23.432
Square toe.

01:45:24.734 --> 01:45:25.860
It is nice.

01:45:26.035 --> 01:45:28.265
This is a fashion
but you can wear to work also.

01:45:29.472 --> 01:45:31.633
Yes. Hey, to be honest,
it's a little tight.

01:45:31.808 --> 01:45:34.936
- Let me measure.
- If you could.

01:45:35.111 --> 01:45:37.136
I'm ready for you.

01:45:37.313 --> 01:45:39.508
Okay, checking the width.

01:45:39.682 --> 01:45:41.616
Triple E.

01:45:41.784 --> 01:45:43.217
This is a big foot, huh!

01:45:43.386 --> 01:45:44.512
You win again.

01:45:44.687 --> 01:45:46.814
Is not a competition.

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:48.981
I do need to cut my nails.

01:45:49.158 --> 01:45:51.058
<i>We don't know
what set off this fight.</i>

01:45:51.227 --> 01:45:53.923
<i>It's apparently between
Middle-Eastern merchants.</i>

01:45:54.097 --> 01:45:57.555
<i>- Let's get some insight.
- They is no Middle East. Is all fake.</i>

01:45:57.734 --> 01:46:00.532
<i>Is the landlord, the Walbridge guy.
He pay...</i>

01:46:00.703 --> 01:46:03.194
<i>Excuse me.
Grant Walbridge, the developer?</i>

01:46:03.373 --> 01:46:04.465
Damn it!

01:46:04.641 --> 01:46:07.804
<i>Mariah Carey, I love you. I love you.</i>

01:46:07.977 --> 01:46:11.310
<i>I find you, Mariah.
I come to where you are.</i>

01:46:11.481 --> 01:46:14.882
I love you too, horny little man.
Buy my new album.

01:46:19.822 --> 01:46:21.949
Zohan. He has a bomb.

01:46:23.793 --> 01:46:26.125
- And puppies.
- No.

01:46:26.296 --> 01:46:27.786
I'm gonna blow up this block.

01:46:27.964 --> 01:46:31.229
I'm gonna blow you up,
I'm gonna blow up these puppies...

01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:34.802
...and we all going to hell together,
because I hate these puppies.

01:46:34.971 --> 01:46:38.031
We have no time. We have to make
the sonic power, quick.

01:46:38.207 --> 01:46:41.176
- You mean the sound!
- Yes.

01:46:41.344 --> 01:46:45.644
But Arab and Jews have not made
sound for thousands of years.

01:46:45.815 --> 01:46:48.682
- Now is time, my friend.
- Thirty seconds.

01:46:48.851 --> 01:46:53.185
You can't do nothing about it,
Rabbi Towelhead.

01:46:58.161 --> 01:47:00.629
No, no, no. Let me take the melody,
you go harmony.

01:47:00.797 --> 01:47:02.662
- Yes. Okay, okay.
- Here we go.

01:47:29.092 --> 01:47:32.061
Well, hello, stranger.

01:47:32.228 --> 01:47:34.287
Care for some chips!

01:47:36.399 --> 01:47:37.798
Puppies!

01:47:37.967 --> 01:47:41.061
That dog is incredibly cute.
Did you bring that dog!

01:47:41.237 --> 01:47:42.932
Barry Manilow
used to have a beagle...

01:47:48.044 --> 01:47:52.481
Listen, I'm Grant Walbridge.
This is all a mistake and...

01:47:58.388 --> 01:48:00.253
Keep it together. Keep it together.

01:48:04.794 --> 01:48:06.819
No!

01:48:08.197 --> 01:48:10.324
My life is ruined.

01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:11.990
They were perfect.

01:48:12.168 --> 01:48:13.795
The ratio.

01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:15.232
Why!

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:19.601
No, no, no. Stop.

01:48:22.979 --> 01:48:26.415
What the heck are you doing!
Why you do this!

01:48:26.582 --> 01:48:29.949
Sorry. Sorry. I got excited.

01:48:30.119 --> 01:48:33.213
Okay, we fix.
We make mall, but this...

01:48:33.389 --> 01:48:36.847
It's fine. Yes, it's fine.
We'll be fine.

01:48:37.026 --> 01:48:39.153
<i>It's all b'seder.</i>

01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:53.871
Goat rides! Everybody, goat ride.

01:48:54.043 --> 01:48:56.534
The most wonderful goat
in the world.

01:49:00.683 --> 01:49:03.652
You come. Come, come. Come on.
Come on, now. Give ride.

01:49:10.059 --> 01:49:12.391
I'm almost done.

01:49:12.562 --> 01:49:15.053
- I love it.
- Yes, of course you do.

01:49:15.231 --> 01:49:17.131
I had fun shampooing your hair...

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:20.497
...but I'd rather be licking it off
those melons.

01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:22.394
I knew he had it in him.

01:49:22.572 --> 01:49:25.700
Yeah, he sounds like his mother.

01:49:25.875 --> 01:49:28.742
Maybe I'll bleach your nipples
and slap you in your face.

01:49:28.911 --> 01:49:32.074
- Oh, now he's gone too far.
- That was disturbing. Too much.

01:49:32.248 --> 01:49:34.944
Zohan!
Can you help this woman, please.

01:49:35.118 --> 01:49:37.780
<i>Of course, motek.
You know, if I was not married to you...</i>

01:49:37.954 --> 01:49:41.390
<i>...this is the kind of bootachem
I would go all night long w...</i>

01:49:41.557 --> 01:49:43.184
Hello, Zohan.

01:49:45.228 --> 01:49:48.220
So this is where you work!

01:49:50.299 --> 01:49:52.267
<i>Yes, Abba.</i>

01:49:52.435 --> 01:49:56.098
And this is your Palestinian wife!

01:49:58.107 --> 01:49:59.597
<i>Yes, Abba.</i>

01:50:01.444 --> 01:50:03.207
<i>Does she know you're a fagala?</i>

01:50:05.381 --> 01:50:06.780
I see. This is because...

01:50:06.949 --> 01:50:08.746
Congratulations.

01:50:08.918 --> 01:50:10.613
Now, cut my hair.

01:50:10.787 --> 01:50:13.051
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:50:13.222 --> 01:50:17.007
I love it.
Please.
