Otianas ol mines.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.009
Continue it, hurry.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.890
Here.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.142
Out of the way!

02:18.596 --> 02:20.889
There is!

02:37.490 --> 02:38.031
The neckoihancer,

02:38.074 --> 02:38.866
The neckoihancer,

02:39.033 --> 02:39.324
The neckoihancer,

02:39.367 --> 02:39.658
The neckoihancer,

03:12.066 --> 03:13.191
Marek!

03:13.526 --> 03:17.112
Your mind should be as sharp and
focused as the tip of that arrow.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.198
When you are not distracted by fear
and desire, pierces all things.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.034
Conversely, you pierces you.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.410
I pierce me?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.745
What does that mean?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.790
Concentrate.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.420
Concentrate '.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.714
As I can concentrate when these.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.050
Teaching and speaking in proverbs
circle 7.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.635
I 're holding.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.764
You have faced certain death before.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.807
And you have defeated your courage
and bravery.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.395
The next voice purge someone's life.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.191
It will be difficult for you to
recover.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.985
Many years.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.697
I had a team.
We ilamÃ¢bamos red thorns.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.826
And we were good.
The best we had.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.621
We had the favor of the gods.

04:08.081 --> 04:12.501
And we were rich and powerful.

04:12.794 --> 04:13.835
The envy of the kingdom.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.379
And you were a hero.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.173
What happened?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.134
I had to stop corlok not to meet the
dark seed.

04:23.304 --> 04:26.932
And sacrificing a dear friend.
There was no other way.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.769
Others never forgave me so that was
the end.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.729
Red thorns.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.818
Heroes do what others can not.

04:38.820 --> 04:42.572
Not because I want.
Not for themselves and their
friends.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.201
They choose the path that nobody
wants.
More dark roads.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.578
You can do that?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.000
Yes I think so.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.212
All right.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.603
For you.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.774
Thank you.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.737
Adescas not me.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.407
Marek, you curse the day I met pyo
go jun.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.913
Now, focus!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.735
Possessions, feelings.
Friends, even enemies.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.862
You must cut all ties and be free of
them.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.823
Despejate.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.915
When you said you were going to
delay, I did not believe you'd say
so literally.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.667
The more I 'll fight me here.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.212
Less energy you have to fight me
here.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.235
What is it?

06:44.654 --> 06:45.779
What is it?

06:54.956 --> 06:58.458
It 's just a feeling.
He's gone.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.588
We 've done enough for today.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.468
I'll be here before dawn to start
again.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.138
Before dawn!

07:39.917 --> 07:41.334
Gentlemen, music, please!

08:15.369 --> 08:16.453
Hammerhead!

08:18.331 --> 08:20.415
Another round of drinks for us!

08:21.042 --> 08:22.375
On account of the red thorns.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.838
Thanks, red thorns.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.049
We are the red thorns!
We are?

08:29.258 --> 08:30.008
Whether.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.635
I like it.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.510
No, red is not my color.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.347
Two against one.
Dagen. We are red thorns.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.684
We are red thorns.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.774
Teela?

08:46.692 --> 08:47.776
Teela!

08:48.402 --> 08:49.402
Teela!

08:50.446 --> 08:51.738
Teela!

08:55.743 --> 08:56.952
Teela!

08:59.747 --> 09:01.248
Look to you.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.832
I'm fine.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.709
I'm glad to see you, thane.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.045
You glad to see me.

09:07.922 --> 09:12.676
And if the other side that we yearn
to see is mine?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.223
Heavens, I 'm famelica.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.642
Let me get something to eat.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.535
Whether.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.997
Whether!

09:43.749 --> 09:46.334
Do not.
No no. Do not fall. Do not fall.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.837
I have to go.
One more.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.090
I told Jun Pyo go 'd see him
tonight.

09:52.717 --> 09:56.803
You promised that old gray Skete you
preferred to see him.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.055
To stay with this.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.600
Calm down, dagen.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.979
I 'm sure there are old mysteries
yours.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.524
With which you can seduce so you get
a discount.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.945
Discount!
Discount?
Wait wait.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.114
Stop joking.

10:16.907 --> 10:19.075
We go somewhere, get out of here.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.579
You and I.
We're going for a walk. Only the
two.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.044
Do not.
I have to go.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.678
Red thorns.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.391
Another beer.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.226
You must have lost its sense if you
do not quit.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.020
Hello, Teela.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.859
I should be going.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.570
I have to pray at dusk.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.157
God, forgive us.
You have not prayed enough?

10:59.533 --> 11:02.827
Insurance gods know not as
desperately as I pray.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.413
Please quitame hands off me.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.630
Did you think would happen?

11:14.924 --> 11:18.218
She is unobtainable.
You can look but not touch.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.056
It is pathetic enough.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.225
Do not.
I will not stop. It's pathetic.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.353
Frankly, you ruin our scent of
victory.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.148
Smells flaccid, unmanly.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.441
Smells falls balls.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.948
It's okay.
Enough.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.493
I see you in the cave.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.004
Goddess of light.
Hear my prayer.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.924
I'm at a crossroads.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.182
Forgive me.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.436
I have not finished praying.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.396
This will not delay.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.359
I just want to say that I was a good
soldier.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.696
That7 never fell asleep in a guard.

12:20.197 --> 12:23.283
I never received any complaints.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.535
I got up every morning before touch.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.329
I know what it means to take an
oath.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.208
And I know what it means breaking
one.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.004
Thane.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.672
I just want to tell you.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.467
I respect your vote.

12:42.636 --> 12:45.221
You do not have to ever get away
more.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.849
Now I am your brother in arms.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.810
Nothing more.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.447
It is more or less the reaction I
expected.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.782
Goodnight.

13:10.664 --> 13:11.956
Thane.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.453
Good timing.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.289
We must close the laptop before they
pass over them.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.958
Closes the portal.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.376
As I close?

14:38.836 --> 14:39.877
Antimagic test.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.838
That will not work!

14:42.172 --> 14:43.256
Anything!

15:23.297 --> 15:24.380
Not good.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.909
I 'm about 30 seconds.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.119
To kill them all.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.621
I can not fight them all.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.708
As soon as I get 10 seconds 'll
help.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.699
You teach me that.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.118
Yeah, of course.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.495
Once you find enough strength.

16:37.704 --> 16:40.123
Now, seriously.

16:40.707 --> 16:44.210
I need to heal my wounds.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.254
Pye '.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.631
I am sorry.

17:18.244 --> 17:20.621
I'm not sure.
You may need to burn the whole body.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.039
Sorry, PANIC.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.791
Just be glad you passed out before
it started to burn.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.880
I am not complaining.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.048
I'm here.
Do not?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.011
Where am I exactly?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.388
Near where coaching my team.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.056
What happened there?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.852
And the portal, these creatures.

17:43.854 --> 17:47.440
That night was having a vision.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.026
Corlok.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.070
This assembling an army in drylands.

17:53.780 --> 17:56.240
That night I went to see for myself.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.827
It was a trap and went straight to
her.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.371
Hundreds of his troops were waiting
for me.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.042
I tried to use the portal.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.670
As a last resort to escape if you
follow me here.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.340
And good.
You know the rest of the story.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.800
Corlok has.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.386
Two pieces of dark seed now.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.640
So it has begun work to encourage
the dead.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.267
If you join the four pieces.

18:23.769 --> 18:27.188
His legions of dead esparcerÃ¢n and
turn everything into a tomb.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.565
Be unstoppable.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.152
You never told me the whole story.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.112
How you stop to sherlock the first
time?

18:35.322 --> 18:36.572
It was 21 years ago.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.201
And sherlock was digging deeper into
the hidden magic.

18:41.119 --> 18:43.412
The invaders were on our doorstep.

18:44.957 --> 18:49.001
Intoxicated with a new source of
power that sought to expand with
dark seed.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.588
Joining would become the lich king,

18:53.006 --> 18:55.758
The teacher, death is itself.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.805
Fortunately.
I turned against him before the end.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.892
Sherlock stopped.
Although the kingdom cost him
dearly.

19:09.940 --> 19:10.982
9 now.

19:11.483 --> 19:14.819
Corlok need the last two pieces of
dark seed.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.488
Then you need a necromancer.

19:17.864 --> 19:18.948
I need you.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.659
Well, you can not have you.

19:24.288 --> 19:26.539
And you do what you say now.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.207
Agree?

19:30.127 --> 19:31.502
Stay here and do nothing.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.254
What?

19:33.589 --> 19:36.340
Do nothing and stay here.
You can not just expect me.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.430
Corlok you 're looking but you
should not find you.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.806
Not until you're ready to face it.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.934
Risking to meet him now risk the
fate of the world.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.352
You understand that?

19:49.187 --> 19:50.896
Then you want to just hide.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.189
Whether.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.068
Where are you going?

19:58.238 --> 20:00.448
Stay in your hideout.

20:00.657 --> 20:01.866
And when I return.

20:02.075 --> 20:06.746
If you go here, I'll show any spell
you want.

20:07.748 --> 20:08.789
Agree?

20:13.503 --> 20:14.670
Stay here.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.854
Nizet, goddess of light.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.814
Hear my prayer.

21:57.691 --> 21:58.941
Nizet!

21:59.776 --> 22:02.987
Goddess of light, hear my prayer,
please!

22:03.697 --> 22:06.741
Teela, what happened?
Goddess of light, hear my prayer.

22:07.033 --> 22:08.075
Teela.
What happened?

22:12.330 --> 22:13.539
Teela, calm down!

22:14.207 --> 22:15.332
Teela.
What happened?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.378
They have thane.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.154
You can not just be a man, right?

22:45.530 --> 22:47.406
We will go to his majesty.
No no no.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.874
Thane is a condemned man.

22:57.626 --> 22:58.918
Convicted before you release it.

22:59.127 --> 23:01.962
Battalions only released him to
carry out his execution.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.255
Everything is my fault.

23:03.965 --> 23:05.299
Peregun was behind me.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.801
We should go guild.

23:07.093 --> 23:09.553
Negotiate with Perego, use all the
money we have left.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.514
Maybe we can pay for their release.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.226
I can not go.

23:16.436 --> 23:17.978
He should not even have come so far.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.272
I am sorry.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.857
To 9.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.194
Look.
Thane and I may have our rivalries.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.488
And the gods know I wanted a couple
of times to die,

23:28.365 --> 23:29.907
But I Perego.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.285
Peregun Mallister is a notorious
vicious torturer.

23:33.537 --> 23:38.207
Thane and constantly suffira every
minute until it is released or die.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.583
This is all the money I have.

23:40.126 --> 23:41.126
Take it.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.298
Thane you need.
Marek.

23:47.133 --> 23:50.219
Happily take your place if your
situation was the same.

23:51.388 --> 23:52.680
Is that what you want?

23:53.849 --> 23:55.140
I take your place?

23:56.184 --> 23:58.727
If it arrives.
I will, you know.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.815
I can not.
Everything is my fault.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.860
Nonsense, how can it be your fault?

24:08.029 --> 24:11.448
Dagen, are most familiar with the
union than any of us.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.494
This is enough to free thane?

24:20.917 --> 24:22.418
Maybe I do not know.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.296
Could at least gain some time.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.257
You should come with us, marek.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.259
That only angered more to Mallister.

24:30.468 --> 24:33.387
Maybe, but I just think you should
come.

24:34.472 --> 24:35.681
If nothing.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.768
If nothing works, then you must say
goodbye to him.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.105
Hurry up, before it is too late.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.582
Not often a man in my position.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.836
Get all the pleasure of having a
fighter in his hands.

25:06.212 --> 25:08.714
A is a very special occasion for me.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.968
And I would like you to know.
Thane.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.849
My friends will come and find me.
Mallister. For real.

25:23.229 --> 25:26.231
I'm anxious to hear from your peers.

25:27.609 --> 25:31.779
When your body dies and hang from
the walls of the city.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.865
All know how serious I am.

25:36.826 --> 25:40.120
I have a reputation to uphold.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.083
If you were not afraid he would not
have sent your friends about me.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.005
We can make a deal, Mallister.

25:50.590 --> 25:51.966
It can work for you.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.762
Keep it alive as long as you can.

26:05.271 --> 26:06.438
Enough!

26:07.482 --> 26:09.942
They hurt one more of my men and
killed thane.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.113
Thanos kills and will be none to
protect us.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.490
I guess who come here to save your
life.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.701
Not to watch us die both.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.495
We brought money.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.164
But your man would not let us out.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.542
I say the word, tile.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.379
These worms have a clean shot.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.425
Later, matame.

26:35.176 --> 26:39.346
And let loose the rope and crushed
his skull.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.557
It not, gives No.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.647
All right!

26:50.150 --> 26:52.151
Now we all know our options.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.446
Betilla.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.156
Peregun.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.241
These mercenaries.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.202
Solve our problems with the supply
chain.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.039
Eel.

27:05.707 --> 27:09.668
If, eel.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.005
Do you say, marek?

27:14.007 --> 27:17.676
Dear?
We should do other business?

27:17.969 --> 27:19.720
Do not listen to him.

27:20.388 --> 27:24.183
Kills his men tear out the heart as
it beats.

27:24.392 --> 27:25.517
And teach them.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.979
Wait wait.
Which is the work?

27:29.481 --> 27:33.859
A smuggler north of the border to us
a large cargo.

27:34.944 --> 27:38.489
All you have to do is bring the
cargo to me.

27:39.282 --> 27:43.786
And I forget all the offenses that
made me thane.

27:44.704 --> 27:45.996
But.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.582
If they fail.

27:49.375 --> 27:51.043
Only need to MONR.

27:52.295 --> 27:55.547
Because not only do we pay what we
bring?

27:55.757 --> 28:00.219
You have 20,000 gold coins in that
bag of yours?

28:03.598 --> 28:07.935
Because that's what a load of
ilistrium it!

28:08.520 --> 28:11.688
And it is four times less than it is
worth my reputation!

28:11.940 --> 28:16.401
A reputation that was tarnished when
fucker put a knife to her throat.

28:16.820 --> 28:20.364
And forced me to give freedom of
that bitch.

28:20.740 --> 28:25.619
That bitch that I possess by right!
Whether! Whether.

28:25.870 --> 28:29.957
Whether.
That is the price of your freedom,
slave.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.251
That's what you looked like.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.463
North of the border is a great area
to look for a man.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.965
I need to thane for work.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.009
That's impossible.

28:42.178 --> 28:44.221
Betilla the acomparÃ¯arÃ  on your
trip.

28:45.765 --> 28:49.226
While receiving correspondence from
your progress.

28:50.228 --> 28:54.648
Keep my hand is this rope.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.737
We agree?

29:02.448 --> 29:03.866
We agree?
Agree.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.993
We go at dawn.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.539
Cloth, fabric, enough.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.999
Do not regret.
Teela.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.608
While perego Mallister receive one
of these every evening.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.693
Your friend will live to see another
day.

30:22.528 --> 30:26.615
20,000 Leagues will travel by road
north to the trente the wall.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.159
To find Captain James Purio.

30:30.036 --> 30:33.705
Mallister believes they have what it
takes.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.458
Mallister is a vile creature.

30:36.709 --> 30:40.045
And if it touches thane, I
personally would slice her throat.

30:49.847 --> 30:51.598
For you.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.329
His comrade lives to suffer another
day.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.209
Where you keep these creatures?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.766
It was not easy for you to come with
us.

32:16.934 --> 32:20.979
I was wrong to accuse.
Really was not myself when I said
it.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.439
Forget this.

32:22.648 --> 32:24.983
I owe more thane anyone else.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.113
You 're not wearing your collar.

32:30.865 --> 32:33.617
I am no longer worthy to use the
image of Nizet.

32:34.327 --> 32:37.037
You were not able to heal thane, but
that goes for the rest of us?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.956
Maybe your goddess only removes the
blessing to thane.

32:40.208 --> 32:43.710
No, it is different the heavens are
closed to me.

32:44.837 --> 32:47.422
She may bless your way.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.424
No I can not.

32:49.717 --> 32:50.717
I do not want.
Please.

32:50.968 --> 32:52.969
I can not bear load so sad and cold.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.513
Please.
Take it.

32:57.391 --> 33:00.852
OK, but you need to win back their
favor.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.395
We need our healing.

33:06.234 --> 33:10.237
Thane made his decision.
You took yours. It's done.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.280
I'm sure your goddess has nothing.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.825
You feel like you whine and feel
guilty now.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.078
You chose to love.

33:18.913 --> 33:21.331
And now you're here working to save
thane for love.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.668
That is brave and noble.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.379
And any diosa_decente know.

33:27.880 --> 33:31.424
Love, strangely you speak so highly
of him.

33:32.593 --> 33:34.302
I seem so callous?

33:34.637 --> 33:37.556
You have never taken seriously Dagen
affection for you.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.349
Purio have business with the
captain.

35:05.311 --> 35:08.355
The Purio captain is a little busy
today fighting.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.775
Only matters of war pass this point.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.028
CAPTAIN want to see me.
I assure you.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.659
You can spend.
But only you. Do not.

35:21.869 --> 35:23.078
I'm with you.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.665
But only you.

35:54.235 --> 35:55.777
Purio where is the captain?

35:56.070 --> 35:58.029
It is in the third column.

36:00.700 --> 36:03.118
Wait, you can not be serious!

36:03.327 --> 36:05.996
Up there if he dies before we get
there, our track ran out.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.498
Along with the Mission.
Along with your friend 's life.

36:49.707 --> 36:50.999
Water.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.918
So thirsty.
Purio Where is the captain?

36:55.087 --> 36:56.171
Please.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.424
Enough!

37:00.885 --> 37:02.218
Where?

37:02.887 --> 37:04.554
In the shop of the wounded.

38:06.367 --> 38:09.160
What brings you to this hell?

38:10.037 --> 38:11.413
It is a friendly visit?

38:14.708 --> 38:18.044
Eel.
Where is it?

38:18.629 --> 38:22.048
Wait, eel is my friend.

38:22.883 --> 38:28.430
To share the secrets of their
wanderings to require accounts.

38:29.640 --> 38:34.978
If I give you to the eel, he cut me
out of the supply chain.

38:41.026 --> 38:42.068
Please, Captain.

38:42.361 --> 38:46.114
You kill me?
Morire plague anyway.

38:46.615 --> 38:49.117
If the worms do not kill me first.

38:49.827 --> 38:54.247
I need to find eel.
It is the key to saving a dear
friend.

38:55.708 --> 39:00.712
He makes a sweet girl like you
working with a slug like betylla?

39:01.172 --> 39:02.338
Please.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.342
The truth is I have not heard of
eel.

39:09.096 --> 39:11.139
Is a moon, at least.

39:12.475 --> 39:16.019
But you might know where he is.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.063
Get close.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.360
Eel is in love with a whore called
yuliya.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.447
Which is in the brothel rose
travelers.

39:27.656 --> 39:32.118
Onken just outside the south eastern
mines.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.871
If the eel is hiding from the world.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.415
That's where it is.

39:39.251 --> 39:40.335
Thank you.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.972
Leave it alone.
Bastard. What 've you done?

40:36.350 --> 40:37.433
No witnesses.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.061
I'll kill you.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.319
Take off.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.949
Take off!

40:55.035 --> 40:57.537
You want your friend to die?

41:10.634 --> 41:12.552
You do obey.

41:13.804 --> 41:16.222
Or you will not be sent another
message.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.557
You 're a vile man!

41:18.058 --> 41:19.434
As you live with yourself?

41:19.893 --> 41:21.311
You could ask the same.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.313
Necromancer.

41:56.513 --> 41:58.598
You found it?
What happened?

41:58.849 --> 42:00.183
We know where eel.
Let's go.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.306
Direwolves.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.019
Perhaps half a mile away.
We make a fire.

42:45.479 --> 42:46.521
And soon.

42:57.574 --> 43:00.535
And if a hawk would corne?
So what?

43:01.245 --> 43:03.204
Nobody runs my beetles.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.058
Which it is what you give them 7.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.395
Only the nutrition they need.

44:10.397 --> 44:11.689
TALE makes you have them with you?

44:13.066 --> 44:14.901
None of these has more than two
rivers.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.612
But I have kept his lineage since he
was a child.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.198
I like to hold it?

44:20.407 --> 44:21.699
Do not.
Could not.

44:22.701 --> 44:24.035
They are clean.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.206
They are friends of the farmer and
husband.

44:29.082 --> 44:31.209
They are ideal organisms.

44:33.962 --> 44:36.798
What you whisper when you send them
back?

44:39.009 --> 44:40.176
A word.

44:42.596 --> 44:43.721
Ho ar.

45:10.165 --> 45:11.249
BINUB wildebeest mmm I'll guard.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.416
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm.

45:12.417 --> 45:13.626
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm I can not sleep anyway.

45:13.627 --> 45:15.378
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.714
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm Yeah, me neither.

45:18.715 --> 45:25.012
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm.

45:27.724 --> 45:31.561
As Jun Pyo go training it?

45:32.813 --> 45:34.814
He wants to be something I'm not.

45:35.148 --> 45:37.692
Which refined?
ElÃ©gante even?

45:39.069 --> 45:40.820
Gentile, perhaps?

45:42.030 --> 45:44.448
It's not funny.

45:45.576 --> 45:49.036
He wants to devote myself
completely.

45:50.163 --> 45:51.873
Because that would make you more
like nine.

45:53.625 --> 45:54.834
Teela?

45:57.379 --> 45:58.546
I do not know.

45:59.631 --> 46:00.882
Like.

46:01.341 --> 46:03.926
As a hero, I guess.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.178
Marek.

46:09.349 --> 46:11.642
You are nothing like the other
girls.

46:15.230 --> 46:16.397
You are unique.

46:19.401 --> 46:20.568
I do not want to be different.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.072
There is great power in you.

46:27.868 --> 46:29.285
And I do not mean your magic.

46:31.914 --> 46:33.915
Know what you want and go in search,

46:34.833 --> 46:38.252
No doubt.
That's unique.

46:44.384 --> 46:45.801
I not always know what I want.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.254
I can not.

47:23.590 --> 47:25.508
I want.
But I can not.

48:04.881 --> 48:07.925
Good morning dear.
How did you sleep?

48:11.430 --> 48:15.766
I know.
We act as if nothing had happened
last night.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.396
Of course nothing happened last
night.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.940
Was nothing.

48:25.027 --> 48:26.318
I am sorry.

48:27.195 --> 48:28.654
You feel that?

48:31.366 --> 48:34.702
To have something that could ruin
our friendship.

48:35.412 --> 48:38.289
Any chance that something better
happen in the future?

48:43.795 --> 48:44.920
Thank you.
Dagen.

48:45.797 --> 48:47.673
You really are a perfect gentleman.

48:50.427 --> 48:51.969
Not a perfect gentleman.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.306
Something is better than nothing,
that's all.

48:57.642 --> 48:58.684
What?

49:46.149 --> 49:47.274
It must be this.

49:47.818 --> 49:49.109
The Rose.

49:51.655 --> 49:53.113
I have better frequented.

49:54.449 --> 49:55.741
I have frequented worse.

49:56.117 --> 49:57.827
Battle soldiers can make it worse.

50:21.351 --> 50:22.810
Get your hands up.

50:26.022 --> 50:27.273
Wait outside.

50:28.108 --> 50:31.485
I do not like to be touched by so
sick and vile creatures how are you.

50:31.820 --> 50:34.321
TrÃ¨s you look for eel and his wife.

50:34.573 --> 50:37.199
If they find me either they bring
them immediately.

50:37.534 --> 50:38.951
All right.
Immediately.

50:39.160 --> 50:40.327
It is understood.

50:43.123 --> 50:45.291
Hello and welcome, travelers.

50:45.584 --> 50:48.168
Good lady rose.
We have traveled far for this.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.462
Pleasure.

50:52.257 --> 50:53.799
Will and pleasure.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.594
We are looking for a woman named
yuliya.

50:57.304 --> 51:00.556
I'm sorry, there's a woman here
called yuliya?

51:01.766 --> 51:04.476
We see it.
Do not. Please.

51:06.605 --> 51:07.938
Three silver coins.

51:09.858 --> 51:12.026
No no.
Do not. We just want to talk to her.

51:12.569 --> 51:14.737
She is a very popular girl.

51:16.740 --> 51:17.907
Each.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.499
Whether.

51:30.462 --> 51:31.629
Yuliya?

51:36.384 --> 51:37.676
I love your ears.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.595
Hardly are my best feature.

51:39.846 --> 51:41.221
Ok, let's go.

51:41.473 --> 51:44.642
You brought friends?
We can play.

51:45.393 --> 51:46.769
We are not here for your services.

51:47.312 --> 51:48.354
Good.

51:49.689 --> 51:52.232
I mean, no.
Not initially.

51:56.237 --> 51:57.988
Well, I have more sniff.

51:58.531 --> 52:01.075
So tell your vendor who gave them
information old.

52:01.910 --> 52:02.868
I am sorry.

52:03.411 --> 52:07.414
We are actually looking for a
smuggler.

52:08.249 --> 52:09.333
Called eel.

52:11.670 --> 52:12.711
He is your friend?

52:15.507 --> 52:16.590
Yuliya?

52:17.175 --> 52:18.509
We should not carry with Betilla?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.511
I will not let you near him.

52:21.888 --> 52:23.389
Why not?
Killed.

52:24.057 --> 52:26.350
Thane killed if he finds out you
lied.

52:28.478 --> 52:30.145
Betilla us as much as we need him.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.398
We will be fine.

52:33.066 --> 52:34.233
Yuliya.

52:37.570 --> 52:38.654
Where is the?

52:41.408 --> 52:43.909
I find it could save a valuable
friend.

52:45.370 --> 52:48.831
I have not seen for two moons.

52:50.959 --> 52:54.086
He said he was bringing a shipment.

52:56.715 --> 52:59.425
He was more than just a friend.

53:01.344 --> 53:02.720
That is all?

53:04.639 --> 53:06.765
They want more from me?

53:08.893 --> 53:11.186
Do not.
Do not. Thank you.

53:16.693 --> 53:17.818
Morons!

53:18.486 --> 53:20.612
Where is the eel?
He went!

53:20.989 --> 53:22.156
He went!

53:25.869 --> 53:28.829
Much appetite for a whore.

53:29.122 --> 53:30.789
How long you wear sm SMFF?

53:31.041 --> 53:32.291
A moon, perhaps?

53:32.542 --> 53:34.168
He has told us all he knows.

53:34.419 --> 53:36.128
Eel should already be away.

53:55.940 --> 53:59.068
I can explain it.
This is not my fault, just hear me
out.

53:59.527 --> 54:04.990
You owe Peragus guild Mallister five
loadings best ilistrium.

54:05.241 --> 54:06.283
Where are they?

54:06.534 --> 54:08.368
It 's a funny story, actually.
Where?
!

54:10.497 --> 54:14.124
Quiet, Betilla.
Mine was confiscated by soldiers
golgosianos.

54:14.334 --> 54:15.417
You lie.

54:15.668 --> 54:20.089
I'm not sorry.
He was caught only because they know
that mine is better.

54:20.340 --> 54:22.049
And they should be contributing to
this.

54:23.760 --> 54:26.428
If you do not have and can not get
it.

54:26.971 --> 54:28.889
Then you are not of any use to the
guild.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.100
I can get it!
I can get it.

54:31.476 --> 54:32.518
As?

54:32.769 --> 54:36.271
The golgosianos have a mine and a
whole shipment.
Worth at least three stones.

54:36.648 --> 54:38.857
And where it is, I can get it.

54:42.362 --> 54:43.654
Will you take us up there.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.240
Yuliya!
Alton!

54:46.491 --> 54:47.574
Goodbye my love!

54:48.701 --> 54:50.619
It was lovely to meet you.
Come on.

54:54.332 --> 54:55.916
Do not ever betray us like that
again.

54:56.835 --> 55:00.629
Hare whatever it takes, marek.
I'm surprised you do not do the
same.

55:20.900 --> 55:22.151
You see?

55:22.986 --> 55:24.361
This is full of them.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.530
And what do golgosiano so far from
your country?

55:26.739 --> 55:29.867
They have discovered the power of
voluntary slavery.

55:31.202 --> 55:33.328
They dominate all this themselves.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.873
It is running out very fast and very
deep.

55:36.916 --> 55:39.918
There will be an explosion if the
demons of the caverns not reach them
first.

55:40.128 --> 55:41.503
Then you better start.

55:47.218 --> 55:48.677
You see that ridge over there?

55:49.721 --> 55:51.013
It is where the cargo shed.

55:57.395 --> 55:58.437
Who is he?

55:58.688 --> 56:01.607
The man in charge.
His name is tokora.

56:01.983 --> 56:03.150
I do not think golgosiano.

56:05.111 --> 56:08.238
I should not have come this far.
I am looking me. Just calm down.
What happened?

56:08.531 --> 56:10.365
I am looking me.
Who you looking for?

56:12.035 --> 56:13.202
You are scaring me.

56:17.498 --> 56:18.624
You know I'm here.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.293
You're talking about the man with
the cape?

56:22.754 --> 56:24.880
He is not even looking this way.
He got into his tent.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.967
Tokora.
Golgosiano signifies dark art.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.637
What's going on?
Is Sherlock.

56:31.846 --> 56:33.055
Can not be.

56:33.306 --> 56:35.724
Because the ilistrium you mind?
It is not what is here.

56:36.643 --> 56:37.935
The h.

56:39.020 --> 56:41.188
There is the ilistrium we talked
about?

56:41.689 --> 56:46.235
That's not even know that pyre worth
a fortune?

56:49.948 --> 56:51.240
What?

56:55.870 --> 56:57.788
We have to go.
Marek think is right.

56:58.039 --> 56:59.289
You are here by dark seed.

56:59.582 --> 57:01.792
My only concern is the cargo.

57:02.126 --> 57:04.419
It is the only thing that saved her
precious Armgo.

57:04.754 --> 57:07.673
Whether.
The cargo is what matters most.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.694
It is a good day for you, fighter.

57:28.945 --> 57:30.862
I received another Betilla beetles.

57:32.115 --> 57:36.201
I guess I can not get you killed by
one more day.

57:39.580 --> 57:41.373
I'm disappointed in you, thane.

57:41.624 --> 57:43.750
I thought I 'd better meat.

57:51.509 --> 57:52.968
Speaks!

57:57.098 --> 57:58.432
She Loves Me.

57:59.142 --> 58:01.435
And there is nothing you can do
about it.

58:06.858 --> 58:08.191
Oh, gods!

58:08.651 --> 58:11.445
I'm having fun before you put a
finger on.

58:12.113 --> 58:15.741
That's something you never know.

58:19.954 --> 58:23.582
Never tell your enemy what you value
most.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.099
It is after this tunnel.

58:42.310 --> 58:43.435
Now is our chance.

59:08.294 --> 59:09.294
He can not have gone far.

59:09.670 --> 59:11.213
It is not here where you left off?
It's here.

59:12.006 --> 59:13.173
What are we looking for exactly?

59:13.549 --> 59:15.967
A brown bag that big.

59:16.969 --> 59:17.969
Separate yourself.

59:18.221 --> 59:19.304
Do what he says.

59:26.813 --> 59:28.647
Is the now.

59:44.705 --> 59:45.747
Watch out.

59:46.791 --> 59:48.041
Demons cave.

01:00:04.016 --> 01:00:05.267
Golgosianos.

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:10.397
I told you.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.906
That was a stupid move.

01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:39.342
Marek, go!

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.363
You have to save thane!

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.115
Do not.
Do not!

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:04.493
It's stupid, it runs!

01:02:30.162 --> 01:02:31.913
We can not just keep spinning.

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.040
There must be another way out.

01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:38.128
Il istrium.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:12.537
Its beautiful.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.519
It is so pure.

01:03:42.234 --> 01:03:44.736
By the gods, that's nice!

01:03:46.238 --> 01:03:47.781
As they assume that worth?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.115
I knew it.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.241
What?
What's up?

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.701
Your precious mold.

01:03:52.953 --> 01:03:54.954
It comes all from a more corrupt
source.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:57.540
The dark seed.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:04:02.921
That thing?
The source of all ilistrium?

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:06.925
It is an evil thing with a dark
purpose.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.551
I have it.

01:04:09.845 --> 01:04:11.304
You could build an empire.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.891
It was supposed to be lost forever
in this mine.

01:04:16.644 --> 01:04:20.397
But the darkness will eventually
come to light.

01:04:22.983 --> 01:04:24.192
It 'll take to go pyo jun.

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:26.194
The hides or destroy it.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.139
Do you know who I am.

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.559
You know what I'm looking.

01:04:57.893 --> 01:05:01.229
You never will have the dark seed.
The gods will take care of you fail.

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:05.483
You choses them?
Gods can do to stop me.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.986
When I have viday power over death?

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:12.198
I'm not afraid of dying.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.130
This amuses me.

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:30.425
Those willing to die, even marek.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:35.972
Although eventually it will be the
cause of your own destruction.

01:05:37.057 --> 01:05:38.892
You know this is true.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:42.645
And still you can not help but serve
their purpose.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:48.443
She never.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:50.945
It will help you.

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:53.990
But it has already done.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.869
And he brought me two pieces of the
heart of Amakna.

01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:01.581
And surely I will bring the third.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.877
You can not escape your destiny.

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:13.384
She can not escape me.

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.706
I never thought it would end like
this.

01:07:26.625 --> 01:07:27.834
Too young to die.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.711
I'm still in my 70s.

01:07:30.879 --> 01:07:33.548
I am sorry.
This was not your fault,

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:34.841
Nor your fight.

01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:40.138
Please, come on.
You know me better than that. I'm
here for the money.

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.764
For loot.

01:07:42.474 --> 01:07:43.933
If I know better that.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.644
Marek came by.

01:07:53.652 --> 01:07:56.070
My strength is my weakness.

01:07:56.071 --> 01:07:56.404
M and star.
Efl is gtn iii and w e a k e s s
KJ1.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:57.572
M and sti'length is diy wiki.

01:07:57.615 --> 01:07:58.156
M and s t r.
G t h e fl 1s weak today. Hi.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:01.909
All have strengths and weaknesses.

01:08:15.799 --> 01:08:17.591
No no no.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.148
Marek.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:00.737
Gross.

01:10:02.656 --> 01:10:04.073
Where are they hiding?

01:10:06.326 --> 01:10:08.411
Does not matter.
I do not want to know.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.582
Never have another scandalous
thinking about you, I swear.

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:15.960
Hears.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:19.130
You manage to save thane another
day.

01:10:22.885 --> 01:10:24.761
I did not send him to thane.

01:12:08.031 --> 01:12:23.004
NÃ¼ BINUB mmm.

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:05.856
Ho ar.

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:17.994
Time to leave.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.204
Marek, is a trap.
No Please.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:30.798
Thank you.

01:14:32.592 --> 01:14:33.592
FIUBA.

01:14:50.694 --> 01:14:51.819
Thane!

01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:19.138
Bastard!

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:34.028
Then you come to face as you know
you would.

01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:36.405
Liberate my friends.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:41.660
Free them yourself.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:02.723
They are surrounded by enemies.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:05.518
They are surrounded.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.020
Surrounded.

01:16:08.271 --> 01:16:09.814
Surrounded by enemies.

01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:42.138
Unleash your power over him.

01:16:42.347 --> 01:16:45.099
It takes its life force.

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:51.689
It takes its life force and free
your friends.

01:16:51.982 --> 01:16:55.526
There is no other way.
Liberate your friends.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.489
I will give the dark seed, just let
them go.

01:17:44.492 --> 01:17:47.745
The piece is mine for the taking.

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:03.219
Take what you want most.

01:18:04.429 --> 01:18:07.723
Take your place next to me.

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:16.232
Take your place next to me.

01:18:24.824 --> 01:18:26.533
See suffering?

01:18:31.122 --> 01:18:33.916
And you can save them, marek.

01:18:49.766 --> 01:18:51.308
I'm nothing like you.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.894
I'm not a killer.

01:18:54.771 --> 01:19:00.651
No, you're not like me.
You do not look like anything to me,
insolent NiRia.

01:19:02.862 --> 01:19:06.073
Now you must suffer the fate of all
who defy me.

01:19:28.596 --> 01:19:31.307
Take my life and use it.

01:19:33.226 --> 01:19:34.393
Dagen saves.

01:19:36.187 --> 01:19:38.981
Not, Teela.
I give my life freely.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:42.151
It is a sacrifice freely.
This well take it.

01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:46.113
Do not.

01:19:46.906 --> 01:19:48.198
I will not do it.

01:19:53.371 --> 01:19:54.830
It's okay.

01:20:13.016 --> 01:20:14.266
Goddess!

01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:16.101
Give me your glory.

01:20:18.521 --> 01:20:19.646
Goddess.

01:22:29.402 --> 01:22:31.862
Do not.
You did everything right.

01:22:32.989 --> 01:22:38.827
You did everything right.
Okay, are you okay.

01:22:40.246 --> 01:22:43.415
You did everything right.
Go Go.

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:16.508
Its okay, have a rest.

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:18.218
We stop.
Rest well.

01:24:30.106 --> 01:24:31.648
We do what is from here.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:45.370
I am sorry.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:48.874
I am sorry.

01:24:49.792 --> 01:24:52.085
The mate.
No no no.

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:54.588
Not, Marek, no.

01:24:55.923 --> 01:25:02.179
Look at me, Teela sacrifices for
thane and for us this well?

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:06.433
But if we do not hurry his blood he
is on our hands.

01:25:06.934 --> 01:25:08.977
So I need you to walk, okay?

01:25:10.063 --> 01:25:11.229
You can walk?

01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:14.232
Good girl.
Come on. I need to walk.

01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:16.985
Go Go.
Okay, okay.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:22.324
Okay, together.
List?
Is good.

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:38.715
Awake.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.093
Come on!

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:45.138
I did not receive my beetle today.

01:25:46.516 --> 01:25:48.558
I think that means that your friends
are dead.

01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:57.401
Why not talk loud?

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:02.864
I'll kill you!

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:06.618
Yes, I think you would.

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:13.208
Is why we must die, fighter.

01:26:24.595 --> 01:26:26.012
Let it go.

01:26:30.393 --> 01:26:33.186
At good Time.
Mens!

01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:38.817
Where is she?

01:26:39.026 --> 01:26:40.861
We talk about that when we're out of
here, my friend.

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:44.489
Unfortunately.
Not let anyone leave here.

01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:49.035
I'll kill thane and then I'll kill
you both.

01:26:52.665 --> 01:26:53.832
Terminense!

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.034
Where is Teela?

01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.288
It is difficult, my friend.

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:40.462
She is wounded?

01:27:42.715 --> 01:27:43.882
I am sorry.

01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:46.885
I'm so sorry.

01:29:30.573 --> 01:29:35.201
Teela sacrificed himself to save,
thane.

01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:39.581
To save you.

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:39.474
You were right.

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:41.518
I should not go.

01:30:44.355 --> 01:30:46.523
I know where lies the fourth piece.

01:30:48.275 --> 01:30:49.859
Sherlock has no way to find it.

01:30:51.696 --> 01:30:54.614
So we see, we fight if it comes to
that.

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:59.828
Until then.
You prepare.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:15.593
You packed light.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.512
It is a long journey.

01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:21.808
Which is the plan sherlock then?

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:23.727
He is a mortal man.

01:31:24.353 --> 01:31:27.355
Breathe, corne, sleeping.

01:31:28.315 --> 01:31:29.566
If breathing.

01:31:33.612 --> 01:31:35.613
There is no place in the world where
you can hide.

01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:40.660
By. Sf nasty.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:41.035
By. Sf nasty.

01:31:54.049 --> 01:31:58.928
By. Sf nasty.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:04.392
By. Sf nasty.
