WEBVTT

00:03.887 --> 00:07.084
Oh, these are beautiful.

00:07.124 --> 00:08.716
Tell everyone I said thank you.

00:08.759 --> 00:09.953
I will.

00:09.993 --> 00:11.620
Oh, Donna said she'd be by

00:11.661 --> 00:14.892
tomorrow to bring you
her own present.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.990
Look, Kel...

00:17.033 --> 00:18.557
um...

00:18.602 --> 00:20.536
I'm really sorry.

00:20.570 --> 00:23.733
I-I should have been there
for you, and I-I wasn't.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.002
No.

00:25.041 --> 00:28.533
I'm the one who
shut everybody out.

00:28.578 --> 00:30.375
If I had called you,

00:30.413 --> 00:31.539
you would have been there.

00:31.581 --> 00:32.707
I know that.

00:32.749 --> 00:35.582
Well, if you need anything,

00:35.619 --> 00:37.587
please don't be afraid
to ask, okay?

00:37.621 --> 00:39.612
Thanks,

00:39.656 --> 00:42.056
but I know that in the end,

00:42.092 --> 00:44.526
I'm the only one
who's going to change anything.

00:44.561 --> 00:46.051
I didn't think

00:46.096 --> 00:48.064
I was gonna get through this,

00:48.098 --> 00:51.090
but maybe I will.

00:53.236 --> 00:54.703
Hi.

00:57.207 --> 00:58.572
Can I come in?

01:01.344 --> 01:02.606
Gonna be okay?

01:02.646 --> 01:04.409
Yeah.

01:04.447 --> 01:06.438
Colin and I need to talk.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.577
Dr. Weldon, please report
to the dayroom.

01:09.619 --> 01:11.678
Dr. Weldon,
please report to the dayroom.

01:11.721 --> 01:14.349
I'll call you as soon
as I get back from Mammoth.

01:14.391 --> 01:15.949
Okay. All right,
have fun snowboarding.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.584
- All right.
- Bye.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.291
These are for you.

01:27.037 --> 01:29.028
Thank you.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.400
How you been?

01:34.444 --> 01:36.742
Better.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.748
Yeah, me, too.

01:38.782 --> 01:40.750
One week,

01:40.817 --> 01:42.682
absolutely clean.

01:42.719 --> 01:45.552
That's great.

01:45.589 --> 01:46.988
You could do the same thing,
you know.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.014
You don't need to be here.

01:49.059 --> 01:50.924
You don't need a rehab unit.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.262
We could do this together.

01:54.297 --> 01:55.730
Colin.

02:01.071 --> 02:03.699
I know things got out of hand.

02:03.773 --> 02:06.207
And I know things had to stop.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.403
But it doesn't mean

02:07.444 --> 02:09.502
that you and I can't
get through this.

02:09.545 --> 02:11.810
Don't you see?

02:11.848 --> 02:13.782
We're not good for each other.

02:15.619 --> 02:17.610
That sounds so rehearsed.

02:18.955 --> 02:21.947
Is that what they told you
to say to me?

02:21.992 --> 02:23.721
No.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.024
This is me. This is how I feel.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.859
I can't see you anymore.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.326
I want you to know
that I'm not blaming you.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.837
You know,

02:34.871 --> 02:36.839
it was a two-way street.

02:39.109 --> 02:41.441
That's it, huh?

02:41.478 --> 02:44.345
I guess I don't have any say
in this, do I?

02:46.716 --> 02:48.479
Some two-way street.

02:51.054 --> 02:53.488
You know I love you.

02:53.523 --> 02:55.252
It's over.

02:55.292 --> 02:56.520
I'm sorry.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074

05:03.353 --> 05:04.684
- Hi.
- Hi, Valerie.

05:04.788 --> 05:05.914
Hey. Brandon and Steve?

05:05.955 --> 05:07.684
Uh, upstairs,
trying to find what bag

05:07.791 --> 05:09.315
to put the kitchen sink into.

05:09.359 --> 05:10.485
I heard that!

05:10.527 --> 05:12.154
Clare, can you give me a hand?

05:12.195 --> 05:14.186
Coming.

05:23.239 --> 05:25.264
How you doing?

05:25.308 --> 05:27.833
I've been better.

05:31.214 --> 05:33.705
Look, Val, why don't you just
come snowboarding with me?

05:33.817 --> 05:35.375
I mean, just 'cause
we're not together anymore

05:35.418 --> 05:37.283
doesn't mean
you can't come along.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.345
You and Dylan
stayed friends, right?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.315
It's just not the same, David.

05:44.027 --> 05:46.359
Have a great weekend.

05:56.339 --> 05:57.863
Hey, Bran, I saw the forecast.

05:57.907 --> 05:59.340
There's snow headed our way.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.707
Well, as long
as the Buffalo wings are spicy,

06:01.744 --> 06:04.304
and there's a fire
in the fireplace, I'll be happy.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.240
Nice skis, Walsh.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.545
Monocoques?

06:08.585 --> 06:10.143
Yes, they are, Keats.
Very good.

06:10.186 --> 06:11.915
Try to keep up with me.

06:11.955 --> 06:13.252
Oh, I've seen him ski.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.018
He's pretty good, Susan.

06:15.058 --> 06:16.457
Well, that may be,
but skiing

06:16.493 --> 06:18.393
is second nature
to the Keats clan.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.293
We wintered
in Sun Valley every year.

06:20.330 --> 06:21.661
Well, the Walsh clan
is from Minnesota

06:21.698 --> 06:22.858
where winter was invented.

06:22.899 --> 06:24.696
Oh, really? And where
exactly did you ski,

06:24.734 --> 06:26.099
Mount Minneapolis?

06:26.136 --> 06:29.128
Or did they put up a big hill
inside that domed stadium?

06:29.172 --> 06:30.571
That's funny. Keep talking.

06:31.774 --> 06:33.332
What?

06:33.376 --> 06:34.707
They sound like us.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.371
It's all foreplay.

06:37.413 --> 06:39.973
You know, this could be a
pleasant weekend after all.

06:40.016 --> 06:41.449
Mmm.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.781
Come on, bunny.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.147
So, they keeping you busy?

06:45.188 --> 06:46.314
Oh, what do you think?

06:46.356 --> 06:47.721
Well, that is the idea, honey.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.655
Yeah. Yeah, well,
to be honest with you,

06:49.692 --> 06:51.717
I can't wait to get out
of this place.

06:51.794 --> 06:52.988
The food is horrendous,

06:53.029 --> 06:55.725
and is it just me,
or does it smell here?

06:55.765 --> 06:56.993
All right. All right.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.295
It's not the
Peninsula Hotel,

06:58.334 --> 06:59.961
but it's not supposed to be.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.197
I know.

07:01.237 --> 07:02.670
Just consider yourself lucky

07:02.705 --> 07:05.401
that you even made it
in here in one piece.

07:05.441 --> 07:06.567
The food still stinks.

07:06.609 --> 07:07.769
Hang in there.

07:07.810 --> 07:09.368
You only got 21 days left,

07:09.412 --> 07:11.505
and I know you're going
to make it.

07:11.548 --> 07:13.448
- Oh, Kelly, hi.
- Hi.

07:13.483 --> 07:14.643
Hi, Dr. Browning.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.810
Hi, Jackie.

07:15.852 --> 07:16.978
How are things?

07:17.020 --> 07:18.146
Oh, great.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.985
Kelly seems
to be adjusting really well.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.684
Good. She's in good hands.

07:21.724 --> 07:23.692
Well, thanks.

07:23.726 --> 07:26.092
So, Kelly, I've got
some good news for you.

07:26.129 --> 07:28.097
You're getting a roommate.

07:28.131 --> 07:29.325
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.458
Well, I guess
I could use the company.

07:31.501 --> 07:32.900
Good. I hope you're pleased.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.494
But I want to warn you

07:34.537 --> 07:36.596
that she probably
won't feel much like talking

07:36.639 --> 07:37.901
in the next few days.

07:37.941 --> 07:40.000
She's got a lot
of sleeping to do.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.067
I understand.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.202
I knew you would.

07:42.245 --> 07:44.372
I personally put the two
of you together.

07:44.414 --> 07:45.472
Great.

07:45.515 --> 07:47.710
When-When do I meet her?
What's her name?

07:47.784 --> 07:49.979
Well, her name's Tara Marks, and
she's in your room right now.

07:50.019 --> 07:52.385
So, you'll meet her,
no doubt, when she wakes up.

07:52.422 --> 07:53.548
- Okay.
- Okay?

07:53.590 --> 07:54.716
- See you in group?
- Yeah.

07:54.757 --> 07:56.190
Good. Take care, Jackie.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.456
Nice to see you. See?

07:58.494 --> 08:00.462
Things are looking up already.

08:18.481 --> 08:19.641
So, what's the plan?

08:19.682 --> 08:21.616
We're going to check in,
then hit the slopes.

08:21.651 --> 08:22.879
You know what? I think

08:22.919 --> 08:24.682
I'm just gonna hang
out in the lodge today.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.018
Are you serious?

08:26.055 --> 08:27.852
There's got to be, what,
five hours of daylight left.

08:27.890 --> 08:30.017
What are you going to mope
around the lodge all day for?

08:30.059 --> 08:31.458
I'm just not in a
good mood, all right?

08:31.494 --> 08:33.291
- Do me a favor? Check in for me.
- Yeah, sure.

08:33.328 --> 08:34.818
- What's the deal with him?
- Love hurts.

08:34.864 --> 08:36.263
Well, it's not like
he got dumped.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.493
Well, maybe he's
having second thoughts.

08:37.533 --> 08:38.932
You know, it's like
riding a horse.

08:38.967 --> 08:40.958
You fall off the saddle,
you get right back on.

08:41.004 --> 08:42.265
Silver's always been
too sensitive.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.273
He just needs a little action
to set him straight.

08:44.307 --> 08:46.138
You know what? That's your
theory for everything, okay?

08:46.175 --> 08:47.574
Just stay out of it.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.840
Well, I am going to go
check out the ski shop.

08:49.879 --> 08:52.575
Shall I see if they have any
training poles for you?

08:54.017 --> 08:55.814
What's up with her?

08:55.852 --> 08:59.344
I don't know, but it's really
starting to piss me off.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.590
Excuse me?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.752
Oh, this is going to
sound incredibly awkward,

09:04.794 --> 09:07.388
but I just drove all
the way up from L.A.,

09:07.430 --> 09:09.295
and they lost
my reservation.

09:09.332 --> 09:10.959
You guys think I might be
able to bunk with you?

09:12.535 --> 09:13.797
I'd pay.

09:15.338 --> 09:16.669
Oh, gosh.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.138
Uh, we're really sorry.

09:18.174 --> 09:20.506
We came up with our boyfriends,
and you know.

09:20.543 --> 09:21.669
Oh.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.939
Well, lucky you.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.241
I used to have one.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.441
Do you want to meet somebody?

09:26.482 --> 09:28.245
Sure. That's why I'm here.

09:28.284 --> 09:30.878
I mean, it's not
'cause I know how to ski.

09:32.288 --> 09:33.482
I'm-I'm Mary.

09:33.523 --> 09:34.990
Hi. I'm Clare.
This is Susan.

09:35.024 --> 09:36.218
Hi. Nice to meet you.

09:36.259 --> 09:38.386
Why don't you meet us later
for drinks,

09:38.428 --> 09:39.554
like, around 5:00?

09:39.595 --> 09:40.687
We have this
really cute friend.

09:40.763 --> 09:41.889
His name's David.

09:41.931 --> 09:43.899
Okay. Uh...

09:43.933 --> 09:45.594
Does your friend have a room?

09:45.635 --> 09:47.193
With a big, king-sized bed.

09:47.236 --> 09:48.703
Hmm. Sounds good to me.

09:48.738 --> 09:50.797
He shouldn't mind the floor.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.016
Hi.

10:09.058 --> 10:11.959
How long have I been sleeping?

10:11.994 --> 10:13.962
Since you got here.

10:13.996 --> 10:16.021
All morning.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.798
I'm Kelly.

10:22.171 --> 10:23.433
I'm Tara.

10:23.473 --> 10:25.737
Do you want me
to get you some water?

10:25.775 --> 10:28.369
They say it's good
to drink a lot of water.

10:37.653 --> 10:40.247
You okay?

10:45.161 --> 10:47.129
It's going to be all right.

11:06.115 --> 11:07.878
B, B...

11:07.917 --> 11:08.884
Yeah? What?

11:08.918 --> 11:11.045
- Check out that girl.
- What about her?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.918
Well, she's practically
undressing me

11:12.955 --> 11:15.515
with her eyes right now.

11:17.627 --> 11:18.855
No, she isn't, Steve.

11:18.895 --> 11:20.954
She's looking for a bellhop.

11:20.997 --> 11:22.521
Her search is over.

11:22.565 --> 11:23.827
Easy, big fella.

11:23.866 --> 11:25.493
You're here with Clare.

11:25.535 --> 11:27.127
Not for me.

11:27.170 --> 11:28.728
For Silver.

11:28.805 --> 11:30.136
For Silver.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.071
Hi. I'm Steve.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.408
This is Brandon.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.413
Hi.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.607
Thanks. I'm Mary.

11:38.648 --> 11:39.637
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi, Mary.

11:39.682 --> 11:40.649
Are you here alone?

11:40.683 --> 11:42.446
Actually, I am.
Are you?

11:42.485 --> 11:44.976
No, tragically.

11:45.021 --> 11:47.182
But we, uh, brought a
friend with us who is.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.656
Perhaps you'd like
to meet him.

11:48.691 --> 11:51.057
He just broke up
with his girlfriend.

11:51.093 --> 11:52.424
Yeah, he could use
some company.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.588
Well, is he cute?

11:53.629 --> 11:56.097
Yeah, he's right over there.

11:59.035 --> 12:00.434
Yeah, he is cute.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.301
Yeah, I'd like to meet him.

12:02.338 --> 12:03.930
But, um, I've got a lesson
in half an hour,

12:03.973 --> 12:06.373
and I've got to check in
and change.

12:06.409 --> 12:08.536
Maybe you can meet us
for drinks later?

12:08.578 --> 12:10.273
We'll be down here
around 5:00.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.712
Okay. See you.

12:11.781 --> 12:14.011
Great. Hey, uh, would you mind
helping her?

12:14.050 --> 12:16.314
Cool.
See you, Mary.

12:16.352 --> 12:17.944
See you.

12:19.322 --> 12:20.516
I wish I had a friend like me.

12:20.556 --> 12:23.354
So do I.

12:23.392 --> 12:26.088
But... you do.

12:28.030 --> 12:30.863
Damn, it's going down.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.299
What?

12:32.335 --> 12:33.597
I made a small investment.

12:33.636 --> 12:36.002
Oh, you're playing
the stock market, huh?

12:36.038 --> 12:37.835
No, I'm not playing.
I really know what I'm doing.

12:37.874 --> 12:39.398
I got a tip
on this company

12:39.442 --> 12:41.876
that grows human ears
on the backs of mice.

12:41.911 --> 12:43.139
Really?

12:43.179 --> 12:46.205
Oh, there's got to be
a lot of call for that.

12:46.249 --> 12:48.444
Aw! Damn it went down!

12:48.484 --> 12:51.180
There's new hope for athletes
with heart problems.

12:51.220 --> 12:52.346
Oh, oh, wait,
don't turn that off.

12:52.388 --> 12:54.253
Athletes suffering from
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

12:54.290 --> 12:57.987
or HCM, may now have a chance
to continue their careers.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.187
A new study presented

12:59.228 --> 13:01.287
to the American Heart
Association offers

13:01.330 --> 13:03.560
a ray of hope for those
who still wish to compete.

13:03.599 --> 13:06.363
In other medical news,
generic drugs continue to...

13:08.337 --> 13:10.464
Yeah, the receptionist said

13:10.506 --> 13:12.167
you were the one
I needed to speak to.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.836
Yeah, it's about the segment
you aired this morning

13:14.877 --> 13:17.675
on athletes
and heart conditions.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.113
Okay, yeah, if I can have
that number in New Jersey.

13:20.149 --> 13:21.411
Okay.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.577
Hey.

13:23.619 --> 13:26.053
Hey. How long have
you been here?

13:26.088 --> 13:27.680
Long enough.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.714
What was that all about?

13:29.825 --> 13:31.156
Hold on.

13:31.193 --> 13:32.524
Hi. Yeah, I'm here.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.722
Great.

13:33.763 --> 13:36.493
Okay.

13:36.532 --> 13:37.521
Thanks.

13:38.601 --> 13:40.193
Who were you talking to?

13:40.236 --> 13:43.501
The Money Cable Network.

13:43.539 --> 13:45.632
I saw this segment on TV
this morning about...

13:45.675 --> 13:47.233
Athletes with heart conditions.

13:47.276 --> 13:48.470
I heard.

13:48.511 --> 13:50.945
What was it, a list of guys
who've dropped dead?

13:50.980 --> 13:53.073
No. It's a new procedure.

13:53.115 --> 13:55.174
You could keep playing.

13:55.217 --> 13:56.741
How do you know

13:56.819 --> 13:58.514
that they were even talking
about the thing that I have?

13:58.554 --> 13:59.748
Do you know how many
different kinds

13:59.855 --> 14:01.254
of heart conditions
there are?

14:01.290 --> 14:02.985
Cardiomyopathy,
thickening of the heart walls.

14:03.025 --> 14:05.550
- That's what you have, right?
- Yeah.

14:05.595 --> 14:06.789
Well, that's
what they're talking about.

14:06.829 --> 14:09.263
Don't you think that a doctor,
like your father,

14:09.298 --> 14:11.459
would have told me if there was
something that I could do?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.468
Well, maybe he didn't know
about it.

14:13.502 --> 14:14.799
Maybe you heard wrong.

14:14.837 --> 14:16.532
You know what?

14:16.572 --> 14:17.698
You don't have a thick heart.

14:17.807 --> 14:20.241
You have a thick head.

14:22.745 --> 14:24.212
You don't give up, do you?

14:24.246 --> 14:26.305
No.

14:28.818 --> 14:30.718
What do you think?

14:30.786 --> 14:32.310
We warm up on, uh, Dry Creek,

14:32.355 --> 14:33.720
then do Climax?

14:33.756 --> 14:35.951
I warm up on hot chocolate
and then I do cappuccino.

14:35.992 --> 14:37.721
I'm gonna stick with my baby
on the bunny slopes.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.728
- Thank you.
- What about you, Walsh?

14:39.795 --> 14:42.059
No black diamond
for you today either?

14:42.098 --> 14:43.497
Am I on my own?

14:43.532 --> 14:45.591
Keep it up
and you just may be.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.330
Honey, there is

14:47.370 --> 14:50.134
no shame in admitting that
you're not a strong skier.

14:50.172 --> 14:51.469
And you have many other

14:51.507 --> 14:53.134
wonderful qualities.

14:53.175 --> 14:55.473
For instance, you're
a really safe driver.

14:55.511 --> 14:57.035
- Oh.
- Ouch.

14:57.079 --> 14:58.876
Get going.

14:58.914 --> 15:00.074
Fine.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.346
Bye.

15:06.188 --> 15:07.917
Hey.

15:07.957 --> 15:09.151
Hey.

15:09.191 --> 15:10.556
What are you doing here?

15:10.593 --> 15:12.356
I thought everyone
went away for the weekend.

15:12.395 --> 15:14.420
Yeah, they're
all up in Mammoth.

15:14.463 --> 15:15.691
That's probably good for me.

15:15.798 --> 15:17.493
Maybe I can actually
show my face in public

15:17.533 --> 15:19.125
for a couple of days.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.261
Why didn't you go?

15:21.303 --> 15:22.827
Actually, um...

15:22.872 --> 15:24.396
David and I broke up.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.839
Wow.

15:25.875 --> 15:26.933
Hey, Nat.

15:26.976 --> 15:28.068
Can I get a cup of coffee?

15:28.110 --> 15:29.873
Sure.

15:29.912 --> 15:31.607
I'm sorry.

15:31.647 --> 15:33.012
Must be something in the air.

15:33.049 --> 15:38.043
Did you find yourself suddenly
single these days, too?

15:38.087 --> 15:39.952
- Here you are, darling.
- Thank you.

15:39.989 --> 15:42.924
Yeah, I pretty much
screwed it up.

15:42.958 --> 15:44.448
Well, I tried to warn you.

15:44.493 --> 15:46.688
Yeah, I know, I know.

15:46.729 --> 15:48.321
That's okay.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.730
You're not the first
person cocaine seduced.

15:50.766 --> 15:52.700
Yeah, I keep trying
to tell myself that,

15:52.735 --> 15:56.193
but I don't know,
I still don't feel any better.

15:56.238 --> 15:58.706
Are you gonna be okay?

15:58.741 --> 16:00.265
No.

16:00.309 --> 16:01.367
How about you?

16:01.410 --> 16:03.776
No.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.674
So what are you doing
for dinner?

16:08.718 --> 16:10.913
I mean, there is nothing like
two miserable people

16:10.953 --> 16:13.444
staring at their food
for a couple hours.

16:13.489 --> 16:16.049
Yeah, that's true.

16:16.092 --> 16:18.458
Actually, I don't have
any plans.

16:18.494 --> 16:19.688
Why don't you come over?

16:19.795 --> 16:21.922
I really don't feel like
going out tonight.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.831
Dinner at the Walsh house?
I don't know.

16:24.867 --> 16:26.300
I have the house to myself.

16:26.335 --> 16:28.064
Come on.

16:30.740 --> 16:31.832
All right.

16:33.342 --> 16:34.934
How's 8:00?

16:34.977 --> 16:36.205
Sounds perfect.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.908
All right.

16:38.948 --> 16:40.142
See you.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.028
You ready, Brandon?

16:57.066 --> 16:59.057
Anytime, Keats.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.602
- So, where are we going?
- Uh...

17:10.613 --> 17:11.978
The Rollercoaster.

17:12.013 --> 17:13.002
Rollercoaster?

17:13.048 --> 17:15.608
It's a bunny slope.

17:38.607 --> 17:40.336
Whoo!

18:25.754 --> 18:28.348
All right, Keats,
admit it.

18:28.390 --> 18:30.381
I beat you on three runs today.

18:30.426 --> 18:32.121
No, you didn't beat me.
It wasn't a race.

18:32.161 --> 18:33.287
Oh, oh, it wasn't a race.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.820
Now you're just saying that
because you lost.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.299
No, I'm saying that
because you didn't say

18:38.334 --> 18:39.528
"On you mark, get set, go."

18:39.568 --> 18:40.796
Okay, all right.
Let's go then.

18:40.836 --> 18:42.201
You and me back up to the top.

18:42.238 --> 18:43.899
We'll settle this
once and for all.

18:43.939 --> 18:45.372
Fine.

18:45.407 --> 18:48.069
Uh, this time it's a race
and I choose the course.

18:48.110 --> 18:49.372
Lead on.

18:49.411 --> 18:50.776
Fine.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.558
Hello?

19:06.595 --> 19:07.857
Hey, it's Colin.

19:07.897 --> 19:08.886
Hi.

19:08.931 --> 19:10.796
- Nothing really.
- What are you doing right now?

19:10.833 --> 19:12.027
What are you doing?

19:12.067 --> 19:13.864
I'm involved
in a really cool game, actually.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.666
See, what I do is I, uh,

19:15.738 --> 19:18.935
I stare at a blank canvas
and wait for an idea.

19:18.974 --> 19:20.999
Then when I can't take
that any longer,

19:21.043 --> 19:23.341
I look at the clock
and try to figure out

19:23.379 --> 19:25.370
how long I have until dinner.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.575
You can imagine the fun
I've been having.

19:27.616 --> 19:30.449
Well, you sound marginally
better than me.

19:30.486 --> 19:32.681
Yeah.

19:32.721 --> 19:34.313
How about I come over early?

19:34.356 --> 19:35.482
Like when?

19:35.524 --> 19:36.821
Like now.

19:36.859 --> 19:39.327
Sure. See you in a sec.

19:42.498 --> 19:44.432
I heard there's some great
powder up on the backside...

19:44.466 --> 19:47.594
natural terrain, and there's
hardly anybody up there.

19:47.636 --> 19:49.001
Yeah, because
it's not patrolled

19:49.038 --> 19:50.801
and it's out of bounds.

19:50.839 --> 19:52.534
We'll be fine,
unless you're chicken.

19:52.574 --> 19:55.065
Cluck, cluck.

20:07.656 --> 20:09.590
Whoo!

20:10.826 --> 20:12.726
- Open it.
- What is it?

20:12.828 --> 20:14.022
You'll see.

20:14.063 --> 20:15.690
It's a parrot.

20:15.731 --> 20:18.222
It's a parrot. It's a parrot.

20:20.502 --> 20:23.164
Oh, my God, that is so cool.

20:23.205 --> 20:24.229
Wait...

20:24.273 --> 20:26.434
Do it!

20:26.475 --> 20:29.205
That is so cool!
That is so cool!

20:30.212 --> 20:32.146
Okay, make it stop now.

20:32.181 --> 20:36.345
Okay, make it stop now.
Okay, make it stop now.

20:36.385 --> 20:38.478
- Isn't that hysterical?
- Thank you, Donna.

20:39.955 --> 20:41.889
Well, I'm just glad you're here.

20:41.924 --> 20:44.017
You know, I thought
I was going to lose you.

20:44.059 --> 20:48.223
Yeah, I, uh...

20:48.263 --> 20:50.561
I went over the edge
for awhile, I guess.

20:50.599 --> 20:53.466
Yeah, it scared me.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.026
Luckily, it scared
the hell out of me, too;

20:55.070 --> 20:56.867
otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

20:56.905 --> 20:58.702
But I...

20:58.741 --> 21:02.074
I just, I hope that you'll
forgive me if I...

21:02.111 --> 21:03.476
No, Kel.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.503
You don't have to say anything.

21:08.550 --> 21:10.017
Thanks.

21:10.052 --> 21:12.350
So how's it going here?

21:12.388 --> 21:13.821
Fine.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.949
I got a new roommate today.

21:15.991 --> 21:17.117
Really? What's she like?

21:17.159 --> 21:18.649
I don't know.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.821
So far, all she's done is, um,

21:20.863 --> 21:21.989
sleep and cry,

21:22.031 --> 21:23.396
and then she got up
to see her shrink.

21:23.432 --> 21:25.297
- How old is she?
- She's young.

21:25.334 --> 21:27.598
Supposedly, she's been living
on the streets.

21:27.636 --> 21:30.434
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

21:30.472 --> 21:33.566
So, um, I heard
that everyone went skiing?

21:33.609 --> 21:34.735
Yep.

21:34.843 --> 21:36.640
Why didn't you go?

21:36.678 --> 21:38.043
Well, Joe hasn't really been

21:38.080 --> 21:39.945
in the mood
to do anything lately.

21:39.982 --> 21:42.177
Though I did hear on TV
about a treatment

21:42.217 --> 21:44.515
for the exact
same heart condition Joe has.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.542
That's great.

21:45.587 --> 21:47.817
Yeah, but Joe doesn't think
it's so great.

21:48.924 --> 21:50.551
He's afraid to get his hopes up
for nothing.

21:50.592 --> 21:53.254
Give him a break.
He's probably just nervous.

21:53.295 --> 21:55.763
Yeah.

21:55.798 --> 21:59.256
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:59.301 --> 22:01.235
Um, Tara, this is
my best friend, Donna.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.294
Hi, Tara.

22:02.337 --> 22:04.100
Hi.

22:04.139 --> 22:05.629
I-I didn't mean to intrude.

22:05.674 --> 22:06.698
I'll leave you guys alone.

22:06.775 --> 22:07.901
No, no.

22:07.943 --> 22:09.501
We're... we're
just hanging out.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.706
No, that's okay.

22:11.814 --> 22:14.544
Oh, she's kind of shy, huh?

22:14.583 --> 22:16.414
Yeah.

22:16.452 --> 22:21.048
I feel sorry for her, but
I hope she loosens up.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.785
Thanks for being here.

22:25.394 --> 22:28.420
Thanks for being here.
Thanks for being here.

22:29.498 --> 22:31.159
Oh, damn bird.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.691
Damn bird, damn bird, damn bird.

22:33.735 --> 22:35.600
Attention, all skiers,
the lifts will be closing

22:35.637 --> 22:36.729
in 20 minutes.

22:36.805 --> 22:39.205
Please make this the last run
of the day.

22:39.241 --> 22:40.902
Hey, can I get
a hot chocolate?

22:40.943 --> 22:42.501
Silver, you would
not believe Clare.

22:42.544 --> 22:43.943
A couple runs
down the bunny hill,

22:43.979 --> 22:46.072
she was chasing me down
the intermediate slopes all day.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.379
Well, I don't know about
that, but I didn't

22:48.417 --> 22:51.045
fall down more than two
or three dozen times.

22:52.087 --> 22:53.452
There you go.

22:53.489 --> 22:55.354
- Hey, how's your head?
- It's fine.

22:55.390 --> 22:56.982
I just needed some time alone.

22:57.025 --> 22:58.720
Oh, well, enjoy
that time alone

22:58.760 --> 23:00.887
because your solitude
is almost over.

23:00.929 --> 23:02.055
What are you talking about?

23:02.097 --> 23:03.462
What are you talking about?

23:03.499 --> 23:04.898
Do you know something
I don't know?

23:04.933 --> 23:05.991
Oh, I don't know.

23:06.034 --> 23:07.194
Does it have anything

23:07.236 --> 23:10.797
to do with, um, David
and a certain blonde?

23:10.839 --> 23:12.033
Excuse me?

23:12.074 --> 23:13.507
As a matter of fact, it does.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.407
- Susan tell you?
- Tell me what?

23:16.612 --> 23:17.704
About Mary?

23:17.746 --> 23:19.179
She didn't tell me
about Mary.

23:19.214 --> 23:20.181
I invited her.

23:20.215 --> 23:21.341
Invited her where?

23:21.383 --> 23:22.941
- Here.
- Here.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.215
- Hi, Steve.
- Hey, Mary.

23:25.254 --> 23:27.381
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Clare, hey.

23:27.422 --> 23:30.220
Mary. Hey, um, this is David.

23:30.259 --> 23:31.453
This is Mary.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.721
Oh, wait, wait.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.125
This is Mary, too.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.562
- Hi, David.
- Hi, David.

23:35.597 --> 23:37.326
Uh...

23:37.366 --> 23:38.890
hi.

23:42.171 --> 23:45.572
Uh, hey, uh, it was...
it was great

23:45.607 --> 23:46.733
meeting you two,

23:46.808 --> 23:48.332
but with the storm

23:48.377 --> 23:50.641
coming and everything, I want
to get a couple runs in

23:50.679 --> 23:52.544
before I... I...

23:56.018 --> 23:57.417
So long.

23:57.452 --> 23:58.476
Dave...

23:58.520 --> 24:00.613
D-D...

24:00.656 --> 24:02.886
Never said he was romantic.

24:05.761 --> 24:06.887
And to think...

24:06.929 --> 24:09.022
Brandon and Susan are
missing all this.

24:09.064 --> 24:10.088
Yeah.

24:32.020 --> 24:33.681
Come on, Keats.

24:36.425 --> 24:38.256
Whoa-ho-ho!

24:57.980 --> 25:00.574
Hang on, Susan!

25:00.616 --> 25:01.583
Brandon!

25:01.617 --> 25:03.175
Hang on, baby, I'm coming.

25:09.958 --> 25:12.449
Hang on, I'm coming.

25:13.495 --> 25:14.462
Brandon.

25:14.496 --> 25:15.588
What's going on?

25:15.631 --> 25:16.791
I can't move my leg.

25:21.370 --> 25:24.828
We gotta get out of this weather
or we're gonna die.

25:47.596 --> 25:48.927
Hi, come on in.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.488
I'm stirring.

25:54.069 --> 25:55.900
Mmm.

25:55.937 --> 25:57.427
That smells good.

25:57.472 --> 25:58.564
Yeah.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.672
Oh.

26:01.710 --> 26:04.144
Too bad I brought the wrong
wine for a white sauce.

26:04.179 --> 26:05.407
Oh.

26:05.447 --> 26:07.677
Well, at least it's a good
bottle of the wrong wine.

26:07.716 --> 26:08.683
Here.

26:08.717 --> 26:10.150
Open it.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.213
You remember when we met?

26:14.256 --> 26:17.657
Yeah, Heathrow Airport.

26:17.693 --> 26:20.662
I'll never forget the
first time I saw you.

26:20.696 --> 26:22.596
You don't remember that.

26:22.631 --> 26:24.929
Yeah, I do.

26:24.966 --> 26:26.456
Okay.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.867
Well, uh,
what was I wearing?

26:28.904 --> 26:30.394
What is this, a test?

26:30.439 --> 26:32.532
Yeah.

26:32.574 --> 26:36.670
Yeah, and you, uh,
better not flunk.

26:36.712 --> 26:39.010
Okay.

26:40.282 --> 26:42.250
Let's see.

26:42.284 --> 26:43.842
You were wearing a dress.

26:43.885 --> 26:45.876
Wrong.

26:45.921 --> 26:47.320
Okay.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.687
Wait a second.

26:48.724 --> 26:49.986
You weren't wearing
a dress.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.721
You were wearing...
pants.

26:52.794 --> 26:53.818
Blue pants.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.420
Jeans.

26:56.998 --> 26:58.522
You didn't look at me at all,

26:58.567 --> 27:00.330
because if you did,

27:00.369 --> 27:02.860
you would've known I
was wearing shorts.

27:02.904 --> 27:05.065
Short shorts.

27:05.107 --> 27:06.199
Cutoffs.

27:07.242 --> 27:09.005
Well, I'm looking
at you now.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.944
Doesn't that count
for something?

27:12.447 --> 27:13.573
Yeah...

27:13.615 --> 27:15.139
if we're grading
on a curve.

27:18.286 --> 27:20.277
Listen, Valerie, uh,

27:20.322 --> 27:22.222
I really want
to thank you.

27:22.257 --> 27:23.554
For what?

27:23.592 --> 27:24.820
For everything
you've done for me.

27:25.861 --> 27:27.795
The mural, the contacts.

27:28.997 --> 27:30.328
You've been a good friend to me.

27:31.833 --> 27:33.300
God knows I haven't deserved it.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.201
Well, it was my pleasure.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.709
Uh... I bet it's nice

27:41.743 --> 27:43.643
to have this place
to yourself for a change.

27:43.678 --> 27:45.305
Actually,

27:45.347 --> 27:47.406
it's a little too
empty for me.

27:47.449 --> 27:49.815
I wonder how everybody's
doing up in Mammoth.

27:49.851 --> 27:51.478
You know, I heard
on the radio there

27:51.520 --> 27:53.078
was a ton of snow up there.

27:53.121 --> 27:55.351
Let's avoid
that term, "snow".

27:55.390 --> 27:57.950
I'm, uh, I'm keeping away
from that these days.

27:58.994 --> 28:00.461
Good for you.

28:06.101 --> 28:07.329
Is the coast clear,

28:07.369 --> 28:08.768
or are there a few more Marys

28:08.804 --> 28:10.135
you want to
introduce me to?

28:10.172 --> 28:11.605
I'm sorry.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.369
We just wanted you
to have fun, okay?

28:13.408 --> 28:15.239
Uh, it's no big deal.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.609
I just shouldn't have come.

28:18.647 --> 28:20.080
Have you seen Brandon
or Susan lately?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.309
Uh-uh, why?

28:21.349 --> 28:23.374
'Cause the lifts closed
over an hour ago.

28:23.418 --> 28:24.544
Any word?

28:24.586 --> 28:27.054
No, but the ski patrol
makes some routine runs

28:27.088 --> 28:28.385
after the trails close,

28:28.423 --> 28:29.651
so they'll pick up
the stragglers.

28:29.691 --> 28:30.885
They'll be in soon.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.086
I hope so.

28:32.127 --> 28:33.958
It's really snowing
outside.

28:33.995 --> 28:35.963
All right.

28:35.997 --> 28:38.693
Looks like we're gonna have
to hole up here for the night.

28:38.767 --> 28:40.166
There's no way
you're gonna make it

28:40.202 --> 28:41.464
down the hill
on that leg.

28:41.503 --> 28:42.697
You should
have just left me

28:42.737 --> 28:43.931
and gone for the ski patrol.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.200
Oh, would you
shut up already?

28:45.240 --> 28:47.538
There's no way I was
gonna leave you.

28:48.643 --> 28:49.632
We just shouldn't have skied

28:49.678 --> 28:51.077
out of bounds
in the first place.

28:51.112 --> 28:53.910
It's blatantly illegal,
not to mention stupid.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.349
Oh, well, I won't tell
if you won't.

28:56.384 --> 28:57.715
Knowing our luck,
we'll probably get rescued

28:57.819 --> 28:58.911
and then arrested.

28:58.954 --> 29:01.320
Well, actually,
California penal code

29:01.356 --> 29:03.449
says arrest and/or $1,000 fine.

29:03.492 --> 29:04.516
Great.

29:04.559 --> 29:06.356
Or maybe there
will be an avalanche.

29:08.363 --> 29:10.024
I'm sorry I got you into this.

29:10.065 --> 29:12.192
Ah, don't worry about it.

29:12.234 --> 29:14.327
What's in that fanny pack
of yours?

29:14.369 --> 29:17.167
Oh... well, let's see.

29:21.776 --> 29:24.973
Uh... oh, lip balm.

29:26.715 --> 29:27.773
Matches.

29:32.387 --> 29:33.445
Brandy.

29:33.488 --> 29:35.149
Brandy?

29:35.190 --> 29:36.157
Yeah.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.091
Old Keats skiing tradition.

29:40.228 --> 29:41.320
Chocolate bar.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.160
Old Walsh skiing tradition.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.224
Oh... we've got dinner.

29:46.268 --> 29:47.860
Let me take a
look at that leg.

29:47.903 --> 29:49.302
Look, I told you, I'm fine.

29:49.337 --> 29:51.328
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let
me take a look at it.

29:52.374 --> 29:53.807
Look, I told you, it's fine.

29:53.842 --> 29:54.866
It's swollen up

29:54.910 --> 29:56.707
like a grapefruit...
you're not fine.

29:56.811 --> 29:58.904
We're in trouble, huh?

29:58.947 --> 30:00.676
Yep.

30:02.350 --> 30:05.945
Well, at least we don't have
to deliver any babies in here.

30:05.987 --> 30:08.683
I don't know about you,
but, uh, a warm elevator

30:08.723 --> 30:10.281
and a screaming pregnant woman

30:10.325 --> 30:12.316
sounds pretty good to me
right about now.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.123
Yeah, me, too.

30:14.162 --> 30:15.857
All right, I gotta
go find something

30:15.897 --> 30:17.091
to make a fire with.

30:17.132 --> 30:19.066
Otherwise, it's gonna
get real cold real fast.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.067
You gonna be okay?

30:20.101 --> 30:21.159
I'm fine, I'm fine.

30:21.202 --> 30:23.727
- Just give me the brandy.
- No way.

30:23.838 --> 30:25.669
What, it's not like
I'm driving anywhere.

30:25.707 --> 30:29.108
It's a myth that alcohol is good
for you when you're cold.

30:29.144 --> 30:31.135
Yes, but if I drink enough,
I won't care anymore.

30:31.179 --> 30:33.374
Fine.

30:34.950 --> 30:36.577
At least, uh,

30:36.618 --> 30:39.052
have something to
eat with it, okay?

30:39.087 --> 30:40.714
No, you take half.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.279
We'll save half.

30:42.324 --> 30:44.986
Around breakfast time, it
might look pretty good.

30:45.026 --> 30:47.290
I'll be back.

30:50.498 --> 30:52.466
No, no.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.128
You don't know what you're
talking about, Donna.

30:55.170 --> 30:57.229
But I saw it on television.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.502
Why didn't you
ever say anything to Joe?

30:59.541 --> 31:03.375
'Cause experimental medicine
is a far cry from reality.

31:03.411 --> 31:06.244
Just because a
couple of cowboys

31:06.281 --> 31:08.112
from the National Institute
of Health make the news,

31:08.149 --> 31:09.377
it doesn't mean
that these techniques

31:09.417 --> 31:10.941
are available to
the general public.

31:10.986 --> 31:12.544
Well, there's a doctor
at Scripps

31:12.587 --> 31:14.487
right in La Jolla who does this.

31:14.522 --> 31:16.547
These kinds of things
aren't even covered

31:16.591 --> 31:18.422
by insurance, and then
you have to get him

31:18.460 --> 31:20.655
into the protocol even if
they're taking new patients.

31:20.695 --> 31:22.595
I'll do anything.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.728
What about Joe?

31:28.770 --> 31:30.635
What does he have to
say about all of this?

31:32.340 --> 31:33.705
Well, he, uh...

31:33.742 --> 31:36.939
he doesn't want
to get his hopes up for nothing.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.206
Honey, he's right.

31:38.246 --> 31:39.645
I'm sorry, he's right.

31:40.682 --> 31:42.445
I'm gonna
make this happen, Daddy.

31:46.187 --> 31:48.087
And I'm gonna
do everything I can

31:48.123 --> 31:49.488
to help you, and yes,

31:49.524 --> 31:51.992
yes, I will call the
chief of surgery

31:52.027 --> 31:53.756
over at Scripps.

31:53.828 --> 31:56.296
I'd hoped you'd say that.

31:58.433 --> 32:00.560
Thank you.

32:01.569 --> 32:03.537
This is the best

32:03.571 --> 32:06.165
white sauce I think
I've ever had.

32:06.207 --> 32:07.697
What's in it?

32:07.742 --> 32:09.539
It's a trade secret.

32:09.577 --> 32:10.908
You know, I could tell you,

32:10.945 --> 32:13.345
but then I'd have to kill you.

32:13.381 --> 32:15.679
Well, why don't you just
give me a little hint?

32:15.717 --> 32:18.311
That way, you can just
rough me up a little bit.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.344
Lemon rind.

32:20.388 --> 32:21.377
Ah.

32:21.423 --> 32:23.653
Yeah, I got the lemons
out of the yard.

32:23.692 --> 32:24.852
Gotta love L.A.

32:24.893 --> 32:26.224
No, you don't.

32:26.261 --> 32:27.489
I used to love L.A.

32:27.529 --> 32:29.360
Now, I don't even think
I like it anymore.

32:29.397 --> 32:32.457
Well, that's because
you're an outsider like me.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.730
Maybe that's why
you understand me so well.

32:34.836 --> 32:36.428
I do.

32:38.973 --> 32:42.739
I even know
what you're thinking right now.

32:42.777 --> 32:44.404
Yeah, what's that?

33:11.973 --> 33:13.372
I heard about your friends.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.602
- Any word?
- No, not yet.

33:14.642 --> 33:15.802
I should have gone
with them.

33:15.844 --> 33:17.072
It is brutal outside.

33:17.112 --> 33:18.409
Steve, they're
professionals, okay.

33:18.446 --> 33:19.708
Give them
a chance.

33:19.781 --> 33:21.408
A chance?

33:21.449 --> 33:22.916
Clare, they've been gone
for hours.

33:22.951 --> 33:24.111
Well, everyone's
rooting for them.

33:26.888 --> 33:28.515
Thanks.

33:28.556 --> 33:29.614
Let's go check at the desk.

33:29.657 --> 33:30.885
Hey, what was up
with Susan,

33:30.925 --> 33:32.324
- she was pushing his buttons
all morning. - I don't know.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.486
Yeah, well, it takes
two, you know.

33:33.528 --> 33:35.359
Yeah, well they can bury
them side by side.

33:35.396 --> 33:36.658
- Any news?
- Not yet.

33:36.698 --> 33:38.325
Well, what if you don't
find them tonight?

33:38.366 --> 33:40.334
You think they can make it
through till the morning?

33:40.368 --> 33:41.426
Well, that depends.

33:41.469 --> 33:43.061
One or both of them
might be injured.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.332
It's blowing like
crazy up there.

33:44.372 --> 33:46.602
If they got in
out of the wind,

33:46.641 --> 33:47.938
they have half a chance,

33:47.976 --> 33:49.637
but the temperature is gonna
drop way below zero

33:49.677 --> 33:50.905
at that altitude tonight.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.412
Does either one of them
have any survival skills?

33:52.447 --> 33:53.914
Well, yeah, Brandon's
like a regular MacGyver.

33:53.948 --> 33:55.916
Good.
Anything they know how to do

33:55.950 --> 33:58.180
to keep themselves alive
tonight, they're gonna need.

34:04.559 --> 34:06.527
I'm scared, Brandon.

34:06.561 --> 34:09.530
They should have
found us by now.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.532
They'll find us.

34:11.565 --> 34:13.534
Don't worry.

34:13.568 --> 34:16.536
All we have to do is stay
awake, all right?

34:16.571 --> 34:19.540
So, we just gotta keep
talking, okay?

34:19.574 --> 34:22.168
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:33.054 --> 34:34.315
No,

34:34.355 --> 34:37.813
no, no, please.

34:37.859 --> 34:39.156
No, please, no!

34:39.194 --> 34:41.161
Get away from... no, no.

34:41.196 --> 34:43.322
No, no, no.

34:43.364 --> 34:44.661
No.

34:44.699 --> 34:46.496
- Tara...
- No. No!

34:46.534 --> 34:48.161
Tara, wake up.
You're having a nightmare.

34:48.203 --> 34:50.501
No, no, don't touch me!
No, don't touch me!

34:50.538 --> 34:52.529
Don't...

34:53.574 --> 34:55.543
I'm sorry.

34:55.577 --> 34:57.204
Look, I won't do it again.

34:57.245 --> 34:58.735
- I promise.
- No, no, it's all right.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.644
It's not your fault.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.309
Just leave me alone.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.977
Please.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.077
Do you want me to get
the nurse or something?

35:06.120 --> 35:08.111
No, please.
Just leave me alone.

35:26.174 --> 35:29.200
I keep having the same nightmare
over and over, too.

35:31.246 --> 35:33.043
What's yours?

35:35.083 --> 35:38.075
The last night
before I came here...

35:40.421 --> 35:43.413
I almost got raped
at this dealer's house.

35:43.458 --> 35:47.019
And in the dream,
I'm back there.

35:47.061 --> 35:50.030
And, um,

35:50.064 --> 35:52.532
when the guy comes on to me,

35:52.567 --> 35:55.559
he offers me a lot of coke

35:55.603 --> 35:58.595
and I just let him do
whatever he wants.

36:02.644 --> 36:05.636
It's no dream for me.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.807
It's the story of my life.

36:14.722 --> 36:16.849
"Lovers found frozen

36:16.891 --> 36:18.518
to death on mountain."

36:18.559 --> 36:20.356
Happy now, okay?

36:20.395 --> 36:21.885
Please just let me go to sleep.

36:21.930 --> 36:24.023
No, no, no, no, no,
you can't go to sleep.

36:24.065 --> 36:26.033
Sleep is bad.

36:26.067 --> 36:28.035
- Okay.
- All right.

36:28.069 --> 36:30.037
Capitals.

36:30.071 --> 36:32.369
Uh...

36:32.407 --> 36:34.398
Minnesota.

36:35.410 --> 36:37.378
Mmm.

36:37.412 --> 36:39.380
St. Paul.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.560
You know, I don't...
I don't want to do this.

37:00.601 --> 37:02.569
Yeah, well, you're going to.

37:02.603 --> 37:04.571
Come on.

37:04.605 --> 37:06.232
Why? It's silly.

37:06.274 --> 37:09.243
I mean, it's not gonna
change anything.

37:09.277 --> 37:11.245
You know, ever since
I've known you,

37:11.279 --> 37:13.679
all I've heard about is
how much faith you have.

37:13.781 --> 37:15.806
Now you're telling me
it's silly to pray for something

37:15.850 --> 37:17.818
that's so important
to your life.

37:17.852 --> 37:19.843
Come on.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.483
Dear God,

37:49.517 --> 37:52.452
This is a big deal.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.478
Even though he doesn't think so.

37:56.524 --> 37:58.515
So I hope that you
can hear me.

38:00.561 --> 38:03.530
Joe has something wrong
with his heart,

38:03.564 --> 38:06.533
but you probably
already knew that.

38:06.567 --> 38:09.559
He wants to play football
and the doctors think

38:09.604 --> 38:11.629
there may be something
they can do to help him.

38:11.672 --> 38:14.470
But I know

38:14.509 --> 38:17.501
that without your help,
that's not possible.

38:19.514 --> 38:23.006
So if there's anything
you can do...

38:25.319 --> 38:27.310
...would you help us out here?

38:27.355 --> 38:29.323
Please.

38:31.359 --> 38:33.350
Amen.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.655
That's the most wonderful thing

39:02.757 --> 39:05.988
anyone has ever done for me.

39:06.027 --> 39:08.359
You think he heard you?

39:09.697 --> 39:11.665
I don't know.

39:11.699 --> 39:13.690
We'll find out.

39:16.737 --> 39:18.671
Sorry to have to tell you this,

39:18.739 --> 39:21.367
but we're calling in the
search for the night.

39:21.409 --> 39:23.900
The wind is over 80 miles
per hour at the summit.

39:23.945 --> 39:25.674
There's gotta
be something you can do.

39:25.713 --> 39:27.374
It's a safety issue.

39:27.415 --> 39:28.507
I can't endanger my team.

39:28.549 --> 39:30.312
What about our friends?

39:30.351 --> 39:31.682
At the crack of dawn,
we'll be on that mountain.

39:31.752 --> 39:33.117
Great, the crack of dawn.

39:33.154 --> 39:34.485
Patrol three to base.

39:34.522 --> 39:36.217
- Patrol three to base.
- Go ahead, patrol three.

39:36.257 --> 39:38.191
We got two stranded
skiers up here...

39:38.226 --> 39:39.420
uh, one male, one female.

39:39.460 --> 39:40.654
- Over. - That's them.
- Yeah.

39:40.695 --> 39:42.219
- Are they okay?
- What's their condition?

39:42.263 --> 39:43.525
- Over.
- The woman's got

39:43.564 --> 39:44.690
a banged up leg.

39:44.765 --> 39:47.097
But, uh, they're gonna make it
through all right.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.103
Patrol three out.

39:49.137 --> 39:50.900
Of course they made it, huh?

39:50.938 --> 39:52.405
Brandon prepaid that room,

39:52.440 --> 39:54.431
come on, I'm buying!

40:06.854 --> 40:09.118
Hello.

40:09.157 --> 40:10.886
Hey, I hope I woke you.

40:10.925 --> 40:12.722
You did.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.318
What time is it?

40:14.362 --> 40:16.125
It's time for you to get up.

40:16.164 --> 40:19.258
To what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

40:19.300 --> 40:21.063
Well, I just wanted
to say good morning.

40:21.102 --> 40:23.002
I wanted to thank you
for a great dinner

40:23.037 --> 40:24.334
and a wonderful evening.

40:24.372 --> 40:26.340
So, you're not mad at me
that I threw you out?

40:26.374 --> 40:28.672
It was a first date,
you're supposed to throw me out.

40:28.709 --> 40:30.472
Is that what you call a date?

40:30.511 --> 40:33.480
How about I make it up to you?

40:33.514 --> 40:34.708
What are you doing
for breakfast?

40:34.749 --> 40:35.943
I know this great little diner.

40:35.983 --> 40:38.918
Mmm, please, anywhere but there.

40:38.953 --> 40:40.853
And insult Nat by not taking you
to the Peach Pit

40:40.888 --> 40:42.116
on our first date?

40:42.156 --> 40:45.592
Well, if this is gonna be a date

40:45.626 --> 40:47.617
- I want to keep it quiet.
- All right.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.130
You know the restaurant
at Shutters on the Beach?

40:50.164 --> 40:51.131
Yeah.

40:51.165 --> 40:52.462
I'll see you there in an hour.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.491
Okay.

41:07.748 --> 41:09.716
Why are we doing this?

41:09.750 --> 41:11.547
Because it's better

41:11.586 --> 41:13.577
than a lecture on codependency.

41:15.156 --> 41:17.147
You know, I made
an ashtray

41:17.191 --> 41:19.159
for my mother once.

41:19.193 --> 41:21.161
She threw it at my father.

41:21.195 --> 41:22.992
It didn't break.

41:23.030 --> 41:25.328
I was so proud of that ashtray.

41:27.668 --> 41:30.228
What are you making?

41:30.271 --> 41:32.831
I don't know.

41:34.942 --> 41:37.410
So, uh, where are you from?

41:37.445 --> 41:39.242
Originally?

41:39.280 --> 41:41.043
Colorado.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.174
Grand Junction.

41:42.216 --> 41:43.615
How long have you been out here?

41:43.651 --> 41:44.845
Just a few years.

41:44.885 --> 41:46.284
I ran away when I was 14.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.753
What about you?

41:47.788 --> 41:49.050
Where are you from?

41:49.090 --> 41:51.752
Um, about ten minutes from here.

41:51.859 --> 41:53.417
A native.

41:53.461 --> 41:55.088
Haven't met too many of those.

41:55.129 --> 41:58.098
So, have you talked to your
parents since you got here?

41:58.132 --> 41:59.656
Nope.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.998
Do they know you're here?

42:02.036 --> 42:04.197
Nope.

42:04.238 --> 42:06.297
Does anybody know you're here?

42:08.342 --> 42:11.072
Kelly, like I said,
I ran away when I was 14.

42:12.546 --> 42:16.004
When I got out here, I tried
to call my parents collect once.

42:16.050 --> 42:19.019
They wouldn't accept
the charges.

42:19.053 --> 42:22.147
Well, maybe you should
try again.

42:22.189 --> 42:24.157
I can't.

42:24.191 --> 42:26.091
I don't even know
where they are.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.459
They moved.

42:28.496 --> 42:32.455
I kept sending them postcards
with my post office box on it.

42:32.500 --> 42:35.492
They never let me know
where they were going.

42:38.072 --> 42:40.063
Lucky me, huh?

42:41.108 --> 42:43.076
I'm sorry.

42:43.110 --> 42:46.102
I'm not.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.751
Hey, Nat.

42:56.857 --> 42:58.256
Hey, Steve, Clare.

42:58.292 --> 42:59.657
- How was the trip?
- Oh, wait.

42:59.694 --> 43:01.184
You'll see.

43:04.231 --> 43:05.562
Oh, boy.

43:05.599 --> 43:06.691
Thank you.

43:06.734 --> 43:08.224
What is this?

43:08.269 --> 43:09.497
Did you break it?

43:09.537 --> 43:11.300
No it's just a bad sprain.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.864
But the weekend
wasn't a total loss.

43:13.908 --> 43:15.068
Yeah.

43:15.109 --> 43:17.009
Silver struck gold.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.306
Yeah.

43:20.348 --> 43:23.840
So, how are you
feeling now, David?

43:30.758 --> 43:32.726
Ah...

43:32.760 --> 43:34.728
The more the Mary-ier.

43:34.762 --> 43:36.787
Oh.
