WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.206
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.560 --> 00:04.164
It would be an honor
to succeed you, sir.

00:04.240 --> 00:05.844
You're gonna have to
prove your loyalty.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.888
And not just to the Mayor's
office, but to me.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.530
<i>Now, I killed
the man in front of you,</i>

00:11.600 --> 00:12.886
I kept my part of the bargain.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.000
If I don't take over this department,
you and I are gonna have a problem.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.530
You get the hell
out of my office.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.161
I won't forget this.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.690
My God, do you feel that?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.486
That is the tingling
of like souls.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.882
That's love.
That is the real thing.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.925
Nick, before you say anything
you're about to regret...

00:43.000 --> 00:44.081
I love you.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.163
Monroe. What do you want?

00:46.240 --> 00:47.241
You.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.691
There's never been anyone else for me.
There never will be.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.166
Does your tummy hurt?

01:18.360 --> 01:19.600
No, I don't think so.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.810
My tummy hurts when I'm sad.

01:22.680 --> 01:23.761
Are you sad?

01:24.040 --> 01:26.691
Sometimes, like when
my mommy went away.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.682
I thought your tummy might hurt because
Nick's not your boyfriend anymore.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.362
Yeah, I guess my tummy
might hurt sometimes.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.761
Do you want him back?

01:39.080 --> 01:41.280
That wouldn't be right. Things
are really different now.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.041
Sometimes, I miss
my other mommy, too.

01:44.560 --> 01:47.609
Her name is Kelly,
just like my brother's.

01:48.520 --> 01:49.760
You know her, don't you?

01:52.160 --> 01:54.606
I don't know where
she is anymore. Do you?

02:00.720 --> 02:02.245
Diana, there you are.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.322
Uh, time to get dressed
and pack for Dad's house.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.643
Right now? Yes, right now.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.765
Morning.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.406
Morning. I can make the coffee.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.846
Oh, thanks.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.645
Morning. Morning.

02:20.560 --> 02:21.641
Ooh, let me guess.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.320
Yeah, that's Stumptown.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.085
Mmm-hmm. Okay.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.410
It's Colombian... Mmm-hmm.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.168
Mauricio Shattah Red Gesha.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.810
Oh, you're disgusting. Yes.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.241
Close your eyes.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.362
Do I get a kiss? Yes.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.171
That's not all, keep
your eyes closed. Ooh!

02:49.760 --> 02:51.444
You sure we're in
the right room for this?

02:51.640 --> 02:53.768
Slow down,
that comes later, bub.

02:58.880 --> 02:59.927
Happy birthday!

03:00.040 --> 03:02.441
What is this? It's where we're
going for your birthday.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.121
We're going to
the Columbia Gorge Hotel?

03:05.200 --> 03:06.201
For the whole weekend.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.567
Just the two of us?
No, your parents are coming.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.451
What? I'm just kidding.
But there is a guest list.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.285
Nick, Eve, Adalind,
Hank, Wu and us.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.926
Wow.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.729
Everybody's coming? Yep.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.256
Our bags are packed
and we're ready to go.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.441
You just have to get dressed.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.886
Wait a minute.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.520
When's the "Later, bub" stuff?
Get dressed.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.443
I love you. Mmm.

03:27.680 --> 03:30.160
Ah, this is gonna be so much fun.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.845
Blue sweater or purple sweater?

03:32.160 --> 03:33.810
Can I take both? Sure.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.205
We are ready to go
for the weekend.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.529
Did you... I was just about to.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.322
Okay.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.802
Now, um...

03:50.080 --> 03:51.445
Honey, come here for a second.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.404
You know what
a secret is, right?

03:55.480 --> 03:56.527
Uh-huh.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.649
Sometimes it's important for people to
keep things just between themselves.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.326
Do you have a secret?

04:02.040 --> 04:03.804
Yes, and so do you.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.081
Remember what you saw in the tunnels?
What Eve drew?

04:12.640 --> 04:13.641
Uh-huh.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.161
That's what I want you
to keep just between us.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.370
So, you don't want me
to tell Daddy.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.843
I don't want you
to tell anybody.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.641
Why not?

04:23.880 --> 04:26.360
Well, because we don't know
what it means yet

04:26.680 --> 04:28.205
and it could be dangerous.

04:28.440 --> 04:29.521
Do you understand?

04:29.680 --> 04:30.681
Uh-huh.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.564
Good. Okay.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.691
We are ready.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.765
Here you go. Let's grab your
coat and we'll get in the oar.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.526
I'll be back as soon as I can.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.289
Bye, Nick. Bye, Diana.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.284
Have fun with your dad. I will.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.446
Nick?

05:54.760 --> 05:55.761
Nick!

06:48.920 --> 06:50.160
What the hell was that?

06:50.520 --> 06:51.567
Did you see that?

06:51.680 --> 06:53.011
Swirling blue tornado, uh,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.496
skull-like dude with green
eyes staring right at us?

06:54.520 --> 06:55.567
Yes, I saw that.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.816
You've never seen anything like
that in your mirror before?

06:57.840 --> 06:59.968
No. If I had, I probably
would've warned you.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.527
It's almost
as if it was a window.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.162
Yeah, but to where?

07:05.240 --> 07:07.288
I don't know, I don't know,
but it looked a lot like

07:07.360 --> 07:09.408
what I saw with
the Death Grip guy.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.051
Except for...
Skull Man wasn't there.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.921
I'm just glad I'm not the
only one seeing it this time.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.486
Yeah, me too, I think.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.250
Should we tell
Monroe and Rosalee?

07:26.880 --> 07:30.282
Not until we have a better handle
on what it is we just saw.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.486
Okay-

07:51.400 --> 07:52.970
Hey. I missed you.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.041
Oh, I missed you, too.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.571
I'm hungry. Want me to make breakfast?
Sure, if you like.

07:57.880 --> 07:58.881
Yeah. All right.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.643
How's life in the loft?

08:03.720 --> 08:07.088
It's fine. Uh, I'll be back early
Sunday night to pick her up.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.400
What are you guys gonna do?

08:08.720 --> 08:12.520
How many chocolate chip cookies
do you want for breakfast, Dad?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.768
Have fun. Mmm.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.005
Hey, honey, how about,
uh, pancakes instead?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.929
It's okay, I'm making both.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.681
Oh.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.411
Uh, uh, uh, uh!

08:49.440 --> 08:51.681
Monroe.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.928
I'm pregnant, not helpless.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.920
I know, I know. It's really
more for me than you.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.201
It's just an excuse
to take you in my arms.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.441
You need an excuse?

09:01.160 --> 09:02.969
Thank you so much
for making this happen.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.691
My God, they'll let
anyone stay at this place.

09:09.760 --> 09:10.921
Hey. Happy birthday.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.056
- Hey, how're you doing?
- Hey.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.162
This is going to be so fun.
I know.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.520
Such a great idea. Oh, thanks.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.881
Happy almost birthday.
Thanks for being here.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.931
Hi, little sir. I'm so
glad you made it, Kelly.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.605
Hey, did you get that babysitter?
Done.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.280
We're good to go. Uh, what
time are we getting together?

09:26.520 --> 09:28.456
Drinks whenever you want them.
Ooh! How about now?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.050
Check in first, sweetie.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.283
Ooh! Let the party begin.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.805
Hey. Now we're all here.

09:33.880 --> 09:34.920
Happy birthday. Thank you.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.322
Thanks for coming. Oh! Wouldn't
miss it for the world.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.201
So, uh, dinner is at 8:00
in the dining room.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.406
We'll meet you at the bar.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.561
Yes, you will. Bye.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.410
Let me get the elevator for you, sir.
It's kind of old-fashioned.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.931
Needs an operator.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.446
The owners like to keep the
hotel as original as possible.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.727
It's like going back in time.
It's a nice place.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.686
How long have you worked here?

09:56.560 --> 09:58.210
Uh, couple of years.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.803
You got a cute kid. Thanks.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.721
Floor?

10:04.360 --> 10:05.521
Three, please.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.370
Mom, it's me.

10:19.800 --> 10:20.926
I'm at work.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.448
Listen, you gotta
get Dad to call me.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.761
'Cause you're not gonna
believe who's here.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.562
It's that son of a bitch,
Burkhardt.

10:31.760 --> 10:33.569
Diana, these are amazing.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.041
Mmm!

10:38.240 --> 10:39.401
These cookies are perfect.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.041
I know.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.488
What are you drawing?
Stuff I saw.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.050
Interesting stuff. You saw this?

10:47.120 --> 10:48.167
Yeah.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.401
Where?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.281
Diana?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.085
Mommy said I can't tell you.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.445
Mommy said you
can't tell me what?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.046
It's our secret.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.691
I promised Mommy I wouldn't tell
you what I saw in the tunnel.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.281
Mmm-hmm.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.330
Wow. These are really nice.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.760
You're a really good artist,
you know that?

11:11.440 --> 11:12.920
You mind if I take
a picture of these?

11:14.240 --> 11:15.844
I guess. Okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.764
Wow.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.410
You say you saw this
in a tunnel, huh?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.889
Daddy. I told you I can't tell you.
I promised.

11:25.640 --> 11:27.280
Well, can you tell me
where the tunnel is?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.091
No. Okay, all right.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.966
Well, it's good that
you can keep a promise.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.776
Mommy probably thought
these were very important

11:34.800 --> 11:36.370
if she wanted you
to keep that secret.

11:36.840 --> 11:37.841
Uh-huh.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.568
Do you know what these
symbols mean? No.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.643
She just said
it might be dangerous.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.243
Delivery for Sean Renard.
What's this?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.084
Picea glauca conica,

11:57.160 --> 12:00.403
or, for those not versed in tree
talk, Dwarf Alberta spruce.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.856
Dense conifer used as an accent tree...
No, I get all that,

12:02.880 --> 12:04.609
but what's it doing here?

12:04.680 --> 12:08.082
Says, "Happy housewarming, Captain,
from your friends at the precinct."

12:08.520 --> 12:11.440
Where do you want me to put the accent?
I've got another one on the truck.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.280
I don't care. Somewhere
on the porch, I guess.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.689
Excellent choice.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.091
Please sign here and here.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.731
That's it. Have a nice day.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.801
You, too.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.526
Diana?

12:40.760 --> 12:41.761
Diana?

12:45.280 --> 12:46.281
Diana?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.001
Diana?

12:51.600 --> 12:52.601
Diana?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.361
Diana?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.361
No.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.082
No, no, no, no. No!

13:11.440 --> 13:12.680
Oh, God.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.882
- Monroe before and after.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...

13:55.880 --> 13:56.927
Yeah.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.096
Will you accept a collect call

13:58.120 --> 14:00.202
from Willard Goode in
Multnomah State Prison?

14:00.760 --> 14:02.125
Yeah, yeah. Put him on.

14:03.080 --> 14:04.684
Randy. Hey, Dad.

14:04.760 --> 14:05.807
What's the problem?

14:06.320 --> 14:07.321
No problem.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.440
I'm at work, right?

14:08.480 --> 14:09.481
Just doing my job.

14:09.560 --> 14:10.561
Guess who walks in?

14:10.760 --> 14:12.683
I ain't got time for games, son.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.205
It's not a game, Dad.

14:14.280 --> 14:15.281
It's Burkhardt,

14:15.840 --> 14:18.241
the cop who took
you down. He's here.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.367
At the hotel.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.644
He didn't even know who I was.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.404
He alone? No, no.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.642
He's here with a bunch of
friends for a birthday.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.410
Gonna be here two nights.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.209
I'm gonna make him pay

14:30.280 --> 14:32.044
for what he did to you.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.646
To us.

14:35.080 --> 14:36.366
Burkhardt.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.324
You gonna do what I think
you're gonna do?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.241
Amor de Infierno.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.006
Double the dose.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.127
No.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.286
I'm gonna triple it.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.856
They'll be tearing
each other apart

14:50.880 --> 14:52.689
with their bare hands.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.290
Call me when Burkhardt's dead.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.042
I'll call you when
they're all dead.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.921
Anyway, no, I saw you
coming out of the house...

15:33.000 --> 15:34.570
And he goes into his backyard...
No.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.800
Do we need all the details?
Oh, let him tell the story.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.848
I definitely want to hear this.
Me, too.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.082
Dude. So, I'm on the
side of his house

15:41.640 --> 15:43.244
and I'm looking at him
in the backyard.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.042
And I see him peeing
on his own fence.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.531
On, my God. On!

15:51.720 --> 15:53.802
Oh, my God.

15:53.880 --> 15:54.881
You were marking?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.485
I still had a few bad habits.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.284
I thought that was very strange,

15:58.360 --> 16:01.250
and I knew this guy has to
be involved in some way.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.765
And that's when
I got a whiff of you.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.611
And that is when you
jumped through the window.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.244
You shouldn't have come back.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.401
Okay. Okay, okay.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.370
Lighten up, I'm just
making a point.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.610
Come on. Let's grab a brew.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.248
And by the way, you're
paying for that window.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.006
I had to make a point.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.320
By the way, did you ever
pay for that window?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.085
Yes, I paid for that window.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.244
Why don't I remember that?

16:38.760 --> 16:41.969
All right, well, here's to
how Nick and Monroe met.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.565
Mmm! Because none
of us would be here

16:43.640 --> 16:45.016
if it wasn't for
that broken window.

16:45.040 --> 16:46.485
- Amen.
- Here, here.

16:46.560 --> 16:47.561
Indeed.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.848
Your table is ready. MONROE:
All right, let's do it.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.490
Mmm-hmm! Mmm!

17:29.160 --> 17:31.208
Well, question is,
what not to order.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.802
I know, it all looks so good.
Oh, Hank.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.447
Maybe we should just order
everything seven times.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.161
Make that ten.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.846
'Cause, you know, Rosalee
is eating for four now.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.082
And loving every bite.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.245
Look, before we get into the
whole food ordering rigmarole,

17:46.320 --> 17:50.006
I just wanted to say
thank you all for coming.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.240
I mean, it really, it means so much to
Rosalee and me that you're all here.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.083
So, thank you. Of course.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.816
- Here, here.
- Wouldn't miss this.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.921
- Happy birthday.
- Aw!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.047
Thanks for having us.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.525
Geez, Randy.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.006
Almost lost that one.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.121
Sorry.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.729
Forget it.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.602
Monroe, when you met Rosalee,
was it love at first sight?

18:22.680 --> 18:23.886
Hard to say.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.766
No, it is not.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.531
She just didn't know it yet.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.488
But I remember exactly
when I fell,

18:32.560 --> 18:34.085
because I'll tell you what,

18:34.160 --> 18:38.529
there is nothing quite so dazzling as
a beautiful woman saving your life.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.886
How 'bout the first kiss?

18:56.520 --> 18:58.249
That was... That was nice.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.609
Nice? No, that was epic.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.284
I would know,
because I was there.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.371
Here comes something special
for the birthday boy,

19:05.440 --> 19:06.646
compliments of the house.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.528
2005 Brut

19:10.520 --> 19:13.603
from right here in our very
own Willamette Valley.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.724
Wow. Thank you.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.482
That is a very good wine.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.200
Oh, no, thank you, I'm pregnant.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.841
Oh, well, shame
to let it go to waste.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.606
Yes.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.966
Lucky man.

19:29.640 --> 19:30.971
Thank you.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.520
Monroe.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.645
To a wonderful friend, and a
soon-to-be even better father.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.646
Happy birthday, man.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.281
Very thoughtful.
Thank you, guys.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.840
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.441
Bottoms up.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.047
Enjoy it while you can,
Burkhardt.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.767
We are so lucky to
have friends like these. Yeah.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.608
And for us to have us. Mmm.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.929
That, uh, waiter who brought
us the champagne...

20:06.000 --> 20:07.240
Yeah, what about him?

20:07.640 --> 20:08.766
He looked a little familiar.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.524
Maybe you arrested him
at some point.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.080
No, that I would
have remembered.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.489
Well, unless you're going to invite
him up, will you turn off that light?

20:36.040 --> 20:37.041
Hmm...

20:57.080 --> 20:58.161
Yeah?

20:58.240 --> 21:00.561
You should've kept your word.

21:00.640 --> 21:01.846
Lieutenant Grossante.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.362
If you ever wanna see your little
girl again, listen carefully.

21:05.920 --> 21:06.921
You have my daughter?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.691
You stabbed me in the back.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.923
Look, there were things
out of my control.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.286
You threatened to have me arrested
for a murder you had me commit.

21:15.360 --> 21:16.930
I never threatened
to arrest you.

21:17.600 --> 21:20.080
I was in your office.
You said it to my face.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.090
Oh, no, no, look.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.045
I was not being
myself back then.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.280
You're going to keep
your end of the bargain,

21:28.840 --> 21:29.887
just like you promised.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.800
Now, are you sure
you wanna be doing this?

21:32.080 --> 21:33.081
You owe me.

21:33.880 --> 21:35.848
I understand you're upset.
I just...

21:35.920 --> 21:39.891
You are gonna make me captain of that
precinct or your little girl dies.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.762
I need some coffee. Me, too.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.365
Good morning, birthday boy.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.280
Morning.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.921
Are you okay?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.603
Yeah, sure, I think so.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.371
Maybe one too many last night?

22:47.080 --> 22:48.605
Yeah, that's probably it.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.886
I need coffee.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.690
I can go with you.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.406
Or I can just bring you one.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.644
No, go ahead, I'll
meet you on the patio.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.806
Whatever.

23:29.720 --> 23:30.801
Where am I?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.204
You don't need to know that.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.206
Who are you?

23:37.720 --> 23:39.848
I'm the man your daddy
stabbed in the back.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.689
No, that was Mr. Bonaparte.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.561
I want to go home.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.840
You're not going anywhere
until I get what I want.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.524
Please, I wanna go home now.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.569
I told you, you're not
going anywhere.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.361
I said, "please."

24:11.960 --> 24:14.042
Well, you can say
"please" all you want,

24:14.120 --> 24:15.804
that's not gonna matter.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.809
Morning. Morning.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.649
Morning. Morning.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.004
Morning.
Are you enjoying your stay?

25:02.680 --> 25:03.761
Yeah. Yeah.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.000
Morning.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.606
Morning.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.600
Morning.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.600
Hope you're enjoying your stay.

25:19.920 --> 25:20.921
Wow.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.441
"WOW" what?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.445
You are really beautiful.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.601
Thank you.

25:32.640 --> 25:33.641
Wow.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.685
Good morning, sir.

26:29.480 --> 26:31.164
Morning. Good morning.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.561
Did you see Monroe?

26:35.320 --> 26:37.004
Yeah, he was just
getting some coffee.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.006
Okay, I'll see you soon.

26:48.480 --> 26:49.527
Uh...

26:51.320 --> 26:52.765
You know, I hate to
admit it, but...

26:56.760 --> 26:58.205
You are one...

27:00.360 --> 27:02.886
Damn fine-looking man.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.040
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

27:09.480 --> 27:10.561
What?

27:10.680 --> 27:12.842
Uh, I don't know how
else to explain it.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.767
I know it might sound
absolutely preposterous,

27:15.840 --> 27:17.842
I mean, we've never
really even met.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.924
I saw you last
night, but this morning...

27:24.200 --> 27:25.480
There's just
something about you.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.207
Well, I guess it does sound
a little preposterous.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.562
No, no, no.
No, no, no, don't say that.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.401
I really gotta get
all this together.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.281
"Love looks not with the
eyes, but with the heart,"

27:40.560 --> 27:43.006
"and therefore is lost
to Cupid's mighty dart."

27:44.240 --> 27:46.720
That was very sweet,

27:47.400 --> 27:49.528
but I have to get
all this food out there.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.841
"The course of true love
never did run true."

27:59.600 --> 28:02.888
"Now it's up to me,
my love to prove."

28:05.400 --> 28:06.401
Eve.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.680
Morning. Yes.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.451
Morning.

28:11.520 --> 28:14.603
Made more lovely by you
saying the word "morning."

28:15.560 --> 28:18.609
I feel the dawn of a crystalline
new day in your voice.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.809
And your hair is more exuberant than ever.
I adore it.

28:22.520 --> 28:23.601
Okay-

28:24.360 --> 28:27.842
I was just looking
at the view... It is so...

28:27.920 --> 28:29.046
Beautiful, yes.

28:30.560 --> 28:33.131
But it could never hold a
candle to the view of you.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.130
Oh, Eve, there's something
I've never told you.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.969
I admire you so much,

28:41.920 --> 28:43.410
for everything
you've been through.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.768
For losing Nick,
for losing yourself.

28:48.680 --> 28:50.967
Are you all right? Oh, my God.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.646
Do you feel that?

28:57.400 --> 28:59.926
That is the tingling
of like souls.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.291
That's love.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.811
Is Rosalee in her room?
Forget her.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
Feel my heart.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.486
Okay. You stay right there.
I'll be right back.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.200
Rosalee.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.570
Nick, have you seen Monroe?

29:32.120 --> 29:34.327
I never realized how
beautiful your eyes were.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.646
Thanks.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.881
I like your eyes, too.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.050
Ever since the first
time I saw you,

29:41.040 --> 29:42.530
I knew you were special.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.402
And I knew we were meant to be.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.721
Meant to be?
What are you talking about?

29:47.800 --> 29:48.801
Us.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.042
You and me. Are you joking?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.043
I know you must feel it, too.
How can you not?

29:53.560 --> 29:56.564
Nick, before you say anything
you're about to regret...

29:56.640 --> 29:57.846
I love you.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.611
Nick, I don't know
what's going on,

30:04.680 --> 30:07.047
I don't know what's gotten
into you, but please stop.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.976
It would be easier to stop
the world from turning.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.968
Okay, now you're starting
to freak me out.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.407
I'm gonna go find Monroe.
Please, stay here.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.530
Nick, I mean it. I do, too.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.000
You're the only one
in the world for me.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.566
Good God.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.730
Rosalee? Please.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.806
Nick.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.288
Oh, hi. Thank God I found you.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.925
Thank God it's not too late.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.321
Do you feel that?

30:34.760 --> 30:35.921
Feel what?

30:36.800 --> 30:39.246
There's never been anyone else for me.
There never will be.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.484
To think we almost
threw it all away.

30:42.640 --> 30:43.766
What?

30:53.240 --> 30:54.287
Eve.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.126
Have you seen Eve?

31:00.760 --> 31:01.761
No.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.401
Eve.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.641
Eve, we need to talk.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.610
Monroe.
What? I need to talk to Eve.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.285
Monroe.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.444
Monroe. What do you want?

31:14.280 --> 31:15.361
You.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.929
More than I've ever wanted
anything in my entire life.

31:22.720 --> 31:23.926
Monroe.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.568
It's not what it looks like.
Okay. What is it?

31:28.320 --> 31:29.321
Love“.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.480
Real love, finally.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.486
What are you talking about?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.806
I cannot live a lie.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.160
I mean, you wouldn't want me
to live a lie, would you?

31:44.520 --> 31:45.726
Of course not.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.646
I'm in love with Eve.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.765
Monroe.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.331
I'm sorry.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.001
I'm really sorry.

32:00.240 --> 32:01.810
But Eve is everything to me now.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.162
How dare you?

32:06.200 --> 32:07.440
You stay away from me.

32:08.680 --> 32:09.966
Rosalee. Nick.

32:10.360 --> 32:11.964
- Eve.
- Monroe.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.600
Monroe. What is wrong with you?

32:13.720 --> 32:14.976
Nothing. Now that
we're back together.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.240
What do you think you're doing?

32:16.320 --> 32:17.810
You dumped her. I did not.

32:17.880 --> 32:19.803
Monroe, please.
She's mine, now and forever.

32:19.880 --> 32:20.927
No. No. I'm Nick's.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.371
She's not yours. I'm yours.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.920
- You need to back off.
- You need to back off.

32:27.440 --> 32:31.843
I've been really tryin', baby.

32:33.200 --> 32:37.603
Tryin' to hold back
that feeling for so long.

32:39.240 --> 32:44.121
And if you feel
like I feel, baby.

32:44.200 --> 32:47.647
Then come on, come on.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.486
Let's get it on.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.207
We were meant to be together.
No, we weren't.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.930
- Rosalee.
- Nick, don't.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.769
God, now look what you've done.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.444
Wasn't enough
to steal Nick from me,

32:58.520 --> 33:01.171
wasn't enough to have the baby
that should've been ours.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.641
Back off, you crazy bitch.

33:05.760 --> 33:07.800
What the hell? MONROE: I
thought you were my friend.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.890
Don't you go anywhere.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.289
People.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.603
People, people, people.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.841
What the hell is going on?

33:20.920 --> 33:22.649
Hank. Thank God.
I need your help.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.085
Something terrible is happening.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.611
Oh! Don't I know it.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.603
I have been interrupted
in a beautiful place,

33:27.680 --> 33:30.251
on a beautiful day from the
one true love of my life.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.521
Do you hear me?

33:35.200 --> 33:36.281
You.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.841
Baby.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.287
<i>Come on, come on, come on.</i>

33:43.920 --> 33:47.129
Stop beatin' 'round the bush.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.570
Oh, my God, it's
the Amor de Infierno.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.441
That is a very good wine.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.040
Oh, no thank you, I'm pregnant.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.404
Monroe. Monroe. Rosalee.

33:59.480 --> 34:00.606
My love, please. Nick.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.047
My love. No, she's mine.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.529
Let's get it on.

34:16.159 --> 34:18.208
Hello? GROSSANTE: Help me-

34:18.520 --> 34:20.726
Grossante. Please.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.484
You have to hurry. Help me.

34:22.920 --> 34:24.045
Where are you?

34:24.159 --> 34:26.527
I'm at the old
Portland metalworks shack.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.409
2872 Northwest Industrial.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.562
Please, for God
sakes, you gotta hurry.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.976
Yeah, listen, I just got a couple of
things I gotta take care of first,

34:34.000 --> 34:35.360
but I'll be there
as soon as I can.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.487
No, no. No, listen to me.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.011
For God's sake,
you gotta get here.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.320
She's going to kill me.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.123
I found you.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.643
That's not a very good
hiding place.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.286
Oh, no.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.766
Please.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.161
Oh, God.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.524
I'm sorry...

35:06.040 --> 35:07.565
She can't love you
if you're dead.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.085
Don't you dare touch him.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.202
I'm gonna tear you
limb from limb.

35:13.880 --> 35:17.009
Darling, please,
listen to your heart.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.208
Sir, you are really out of line.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.687
Now, please, leave me alone.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.050
We never have to be alone again.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.203
Don't you see? We have
what everyone dreams of.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.606
That's right,
you'll die without her.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.883
I'm gonna get the manager.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.803
Can he marry us? Oh, my God.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.644
I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.723
The only one I've ever
loved is my cat.

35:39.840 --> 35:42.047
Please stop this.
Let me get back to work.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.891
If you leave me,
I'll kill myself.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.881
I can't deal with this anymore.

36:19.560 --> 36:20.607
You.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.241
You did this.

36:22.320 --> 36:23.560
Excuse me?

36:23.640 --> 36:25.240
You did it with
the champagne last night.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.656
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.603
I'm talking about
the Amor de Infierno.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.961
What do you know about that?
Make it stop. Now.

36:36.040 --> 36:37.451
Ain't gonna happen, babe.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.606
They're all gonna die.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.291
Unless you die first.

36:43.520 --> 36:45.761
Leave him alone.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.170
You leave him alone.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.936
You leave him alone or I'll
kill you, which is something

36:50.960 --> 36:52.644
I should've done
a long time ago.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.449
Rosalee!

36:54.520 --> 36:55.965
No!

36:58.440 --> 37:00.966
If you can't stand my love for
you, you leave me no choice

37:01.080 --> 37:03.731
but to end this ghastly farce and
throw myself off this cliff.

37:05.640 --> 37:11.841
Farewell, my sweet, my
darling, my one and only...

37:15.520 --> 37:16.681
Holly.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

37:22.480 --> 37:23.766
Mr. Wu, stop.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.171
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

37:26.480 --> 37:28.209
"What dreams may come."

37:29.160 --> 37:31.322
"When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil..."

37:31.400 --> 37:33.164
What are you doing, Mr. Wu?

37:33.240 --> 37:34.605
Come back here...

37:34.680 --> 37:36.523
Come any closer, I kill her.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.563
Why in God's name
are you doing this?

37:38.640 --> 37:41.723
Your cop friend, Burkhardt,
put my dad in prison.

37:42.160 --> 37:45.084
So, him and all of you
are gonna pay for it.

37:45.360 --> 37:46.486
Oh, no, we're not.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.211
These are my friends
and the people I love.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.846
And you are messing
with a pregnant woman.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.483
Help! Help!

37:55.960 --> 37:57.371
Help!

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
She had nothing to do with this.

38:00.040 --> 38:01.087
You think I care?

38:28.440 --> 38:29.805
Oh, my God.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.724
What happened? I don't know.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.010
I don't feel so good.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.566
Why was I crying?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.648
Why am I in my underwear?
Adalind.

38:42.240 --> 38:43.241
Nick.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.560
Oh, my God.
What have I done? I love you.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.171
You haven't done anything.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.527
It wasn't your fault.
I love you.

38:57.320 --> 38:59.049
Only you. I know.

39:00.080 --> 39:03.243
It wasn't anyone's fault.
It was the Amor de Infierno.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.444
What? But only
a Cupiditas can do that.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.681
I know.

39:07.800 --> 39:10.280
And there's only one way
to break that spell.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.930
Yeah. He took a bit of a fall.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.128
I don't know what happened.
He just snapped.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.725
Right, thanks. Okay.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.729
Well, there's a reason why
Randy looked so familiar.

39:25.840 --> 39:27.763
I arrested his father seven
years ago for murder.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.696
Before you were a Grimm. Yeah, and
that's why I didn't know he was Wesen.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.176
And that's why he didn't know you were
a Grimm and who your friends were.

39:33.200 --> 39:35.601
He probably wouldn't have tried
anything if he'd known that.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.640
Hey, I'm so sorry this
happened on your birthday.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.400
Please, it's gonna take a lot more
than that to break up this group.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.240
And this party is just getting started.

39:46.720 --> 39:47.960
Oh, God.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.886
Please.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.366
No more.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.810
Just let me die.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.804
Well, hey there, Lieutenant.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.962
You and Diana have been
having a lot of fun, I see.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.161
Daddy.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.164
Hey, honey. Oh!

40:20.920 --> 40:22.096
Did you have a good time
with the Lieutenant?

40:22.120 --> 40:23.167
I sure did.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.045
Can I stay a little longer?

40:25.120 --> 40:26.884
I think you've had
enough fun for now.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.689
But we can have
another playdate sometime?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.000
Of course.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.366
Any time you want.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.410
Bye. See you soon.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.565
Oh, no.

40:35.640 --> 40:36.880
Please.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.362
Happy birthday to you.

40:43.840 --> 40:48.129
Happy birthday to you.

40:48.800 --> 40:54.045
Happy birthday, dear Monroe.

40:54.760 --> 40:59.641
Happy birthday to you.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.689
Whoo! Whoo!

41:01.760 --> 41:02.807
Whoo-hoo!

41:02.880 --> 41:04.723
Bravo. WOMAN: Who would
like some champagne?

41:05.400 --> 41:06.561
On the house.
