and you realise it was never gonna work.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.263
My sister and her ex went out
for the whole of uni and then broke up.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.266

wanking over Korean cartoon porn.

Doesn't that mean anything to you?

09:03.544 --> 09:06.797

♪ Tripping about everything

10:41.224 --> 10:46.396
♪ Heigh ho, some things you gotta get over

10:46.730 --> 10:48.170
Knock, knock. Who is it? It's Shane.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.941
Ha.

10:50.776 --> 10:51.818
Up, up.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.446
- Time to go mad in a field.
- Shane, I'm not coming.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.824
Right. What you gonna do instead?
Stay here and eat more chicken?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.826
Shane, you don't understand.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.828
When you break up
with a long-term partner,

11:01.995 --> 11:04.122
you can't just carry on
like everything's normal.

11:04.289 --> 11:07.834
Right, here are three very good reasons
why you're coming.

11:08.126 --> 11:11.004
One: we've already paid for our tickets
and they were expensive.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.675
Two: I'm not going to the festival
on my own like some friendless weirdo.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.136
And three: what's this?

11:19.471 --> 11:20.764
What is it?

11:21.056 --> 11:23.225
It's an orange juice bottle
filled with my urine.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.019
Yes, it is.
You're turning into a psychopath.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.064
You've got to get out of here
before you start pooing in your socks.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.899
But what if I bump into Caitlin?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.402
It'll be so embarrassing.
I haven't seen her since...

11:33.735 --> 11:35.237
- Your mental breakdown.
- Graduation.

11:35.404 --> 11:37.823
Dude, there are
a hundred thousand people there.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.909
The chances of bumping into her
are a million to one.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.663
- Fine.
- This is gonna be great.

11:44.830 --> 11:47.332
Robin's outside.
He's gonna drive us to the station.

11:47.666 --> 11:48.875
You owe me for this.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.409
The reason you want to go
is to see that twat in a mask.

11:51.586 --> 11:54.798
Erm,
DJ Hammerhead is not a twat in a mask.

11:55.132 --> 11:56.892
<i>I mean, he wears a mask,
but he's not a twat.</i>

11:57.175 --> 11:58.885
<i>He deejays all over the world.</i>

11:59.052 --> 12:01.221
<i>He's worth 55 million pounds.</i>

12:01.388 --> 12:02.556
<i>People love him.</i>

12:02.889 --> 12:04.850
<i>He's slept with Bella and Gigi Hadid.</i>

12:05.016 --> 12:07.310
<i>Plus a secret third sister
who's even fitter.</i>

12:07.477 --> 12:11.231
He's my hero. He inspired my latest track.
I can play it for you while you pack.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.066
Please don't. I really hate your music.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.404
Can you believe it took me
five minutes to write?

12:17.571 --> 12:18.947
Yes.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.116
I love you, but can you turn this off?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.368
Wait for the drop.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.704
Just three more minutes.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.039
Oh, my God.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.879
♪ Well, it's the same room

12:34.045 --> 12:38.425
♪ You can find the sleep

- Oh.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.819
Robin.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.905
Sorry about that, boys.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.991
There's nothing like
a dose of Crowded House

13:03.158 --> 13:04.743
to really nourish the soul, huh?

13:05.076 --> 13:06.276
That's my kind of house music.

13:06.369 --> 13:08.955
- Can you open the boot for us, please?
- Oh, sure thing, son.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.208
Don't call me that.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.336
There you go.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.671
God, I wish I was going with you guys.

13:16.838 --> 13:19.341
I used to be a real festival head
in my roaring twenties.

13:19.549 --> 13:20.629
One word of advice, though.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.604
- Shane, I know you're circumcised.
- Robin.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.844
I remember from the pool.
But, Nick, how about you?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.349
Have you still got the old,
erm, boatman's hood?

13:27.599 --> 13:30.936
You know, the boatman's hood?
What we call the boatman's hood.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.355
The boatman's hood.
It's what we call the foreskin.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.316
- Pretty sure no-one calls it that.
- The golden rule of festivals

13:36.483 --> 13:40.737
is to wash that bugger
at least three times a day, OK?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.113
You can remind him, Shane.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.115
Once at a festival in Denmark,

13:44.282 --> 13:46.493
a friend of mine
let the smegma build up.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.013
Even though we warned him.
We could smell it in the tent.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.330
He got septicaemia,

13:50.539 --> 13:54.209
and to stop it from spreading, they
had to remove his whole penis.

13:54.584 --> 13:58.964
Imagine that, just this bloody stump
where your... willy used to be.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.215
Hm.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.883
Yeah.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.927
Anyway, let's hit the road.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.471
Foreskin, wash it.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.257
And you're down there.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.634
- We're not together?
- No, sorry. It was last minute.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.887
- This was all they had.
- Oh.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.015
- Wait a minute. Is this a child's ticket?
- Yes.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.934
- Why did you get us children's tickets?
- Oh, it's way cheaper.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.186
Yeah, cos they're for fucking children.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.230
What if we get stopped
by a ticket inspector?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.608
Ticket inspector?
Ticket inspector?

14:59.774 --> 15:01.693
You've been watching
way too much Miss Marple.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.612
It's all robots now.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.531
Hi.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.954
Hey, pal. Headed to the festival?

15:13.121 --> 15:14.289
- Yep.
- Me too.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.041
- I'm Amy.
- I'm Nick.

15:16.207 --> 15:17.834
Awesome name.
You travelling on your own?

15:18.126 --> 15:20.503
- No, my friend's sitting up there.
- Nice.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.173
I'm flying solo.
Just a great way to meet people, you know?

15:23.340 --> 15:25.425
You're never alone at a festival.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.385
You been before?

15:27.552 --> 15:29.012
No, er, first time.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.765
Oh. A newbie. I love it.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.142
- It's my ninth year in a row.
- Congrats.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.227
Nine years ago, did it.
Eight years ago, did it.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.314
Seven years ago, nearly didn't make it
because I lost my ticket,

15:39.481 --> 15:42.525
but luckily I met a Welsh Rastafarian
who showed me a way to break in

15:42.692 --> 15:44.194
and also how to make jerk rarebit.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.071
Six years ago, best year yet.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.239
There was this amazing halloumi tent.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.159
It wasn't a tent made of halloumi,
but it was just the tent...

15:51.326 --> 15:53.286
I might just listen to some music.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.538
Cool, cool.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.171
What are you listening to?

16:03.338 --> 16:05.173
All right, tickets, please.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.967
Thank you. Thank you very much.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.593
- Shit.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.764
Anyway, according to my mum, my first
words as a baby were "Serena Williams",

16:12.931 --> 16:15.850
which is weird because she wouldn't
have been famous at that point.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.185
- Hey, dude.
- Oh, thank God.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.728
OK, slight issue.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.690
Turns out there is in fact
a ticket inspector on the train.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.693
- What? I told you.
- No, it's fine. I've thought about it.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.570
When he comes to check our tickets,
we just pretend to be kids.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.257
- Pretend to be kids?
- Yeah. You know,

16:29.364 --> 16:31.324
talk about Minecraft
and not having pubes yet.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.952
Are you guys travelling on kids' tickets?

16:34.119 --> 16:35.120
Yeah.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.331
- Me too. It's so much cheaper.
- That's what I said.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.791
- Hi. I'm Amy.
- I'm Shane.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.669
Nice to meet you, Shane.
I assume you're a fellow festival freak?

16:42.836 --> 16:44.671
- You know it.
- Guys.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.172
What are we gonna do?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.591
Relax, Nick. I do this all the time.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.844
I have a plan.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.849
- So what's the plan?
- This. This is the plan.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.100
Standing in a toilet?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.893
- Yeah.
- That's not a plan.

16:59.060 --> 17:03.148
We're in the exact same situation,
except now there's a strong whiff of piss.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.834
- What do we do if he finds us?
- Easy.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.819
Just pretend we're doing something
really private, like having sex.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.320
- There's three of us.
- Pretend we're having a threesome.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.647
Well, how is that any better?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.867
We'll just be fare dodgers
who are having an orgy.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.618
- No, I like this plan.
- Oh, this is stupid. I'm getting out.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.121
- Tickets, please.
- Oh, shit.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.207
- Open up, please.
- Ooh, yeah!

17:21.374 --> 17:22.791
Oh, my God!

17:22.959 --> 17:24.398
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop it.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.713
I'm having sex.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.423
Ooh.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.550
Why are you doing it as well?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.761
- Open the door.
- Oh, my God, that feels...

17:32.927 --> 17:35.138
- Shut up.
- ..so good in my vagina.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.432
Oh, thank you!

17:37.599 --> 17:38.725
I don't know what to say.

17:38.933 --> 17:41.394
- Just think of what you've seen on TV.
- Now I'm panicking.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.229
I wanna put it in your proving drawer.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.690
Ooh, turn up the heat. Don't let it sink.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.108
Open the door.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.319
You are so much better at this
than my husband.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.737
I think I'm gonna pass out.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.947
- Christ, it's too tight in here!
- That's good.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.742
- Let it rise.
- Oh. Oh, yeah....

17:55.909 --> 17:57.327
Oh, that's happening.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.370
That's sex for you...

18:08.671 --> 18:12.008
Oh, well. Looks like we'll have to use
the old foot-mobiles.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.970
Ooh. I can tell you guys about the time
I got trapped inside a grandfather clock.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.390
At first it wasn't too bad because
it was the middle of the night...

18:19.557 --> 18:24.604
I really liked him and his brothers, but
then I found out he wasn't a sushi chef,

18:24.771 --> 18:27.899
he just always wore white
and had a load of knives on him.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.819
So my dad was, like,
"There's no money in ventriloquism."

18:30.985 --> 18:32.654
And I was, like, "I'll show you!"

18:32.821 --> 18:34.781
But it turned out he was totally right.

18:34.948 --> 18:38.785
I'm thinking of becoming an architect,
but an untrained architect.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.954
Then I started a dating website for dogs,

18:41.121 --> 18:44.040
but that didn't really work out because
dogs don't wanna go on dates

18:44.207 --> 18:45.727
because they don't know what they are.

18:45.875 --> 18:46.918
My sister said to me,

18:47.085 --> 18:50.463
"Amy, I need you to sell every single
piece of furniture in my house today."

18:50.630 --> 18:53.174
And I was, like, "Everything?
Even Gary's desk?

18:53.341 --> 18:55.218
Even Gary's dresser?"

18:55.385 --> 18:58.721
But that was before
I trained to be an auctioneer.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.849
She's been talking for three hours.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.434
I know. She's so interesting.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.521
Here we are.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.773
Isn't she gorgeous?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.233
Whoa.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.485
Come on!

19:16.865 --> 19:17.907
Come on.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.617
Yeah!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.870
Yeah!

19:23.913 --> 19:26.291
It's a bit further
than I remember.

19:27.625 --> 19:28.710
Yeah!

20:12.253 --> 20:14.505
It literally stinks of shit.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.925
- Everything smells of shit.
- Exactly.

20:17.091 --> 20:20.053
- Amy, where can you, like, see the acts?
- On the stages.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.431
- I mean when they're not performing.
- Oh, er, backstage, I guess. Why?

20:23.598 --> 20:25.516
- I wanna try and meet Hammerhead.
- He's great.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.853
I wanna get a selfie playing my tunes,
maybe convince him to legally adopt me.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.315
Well, the best way to get backstage
is to either be a famous person

20:32.482 --> 20:35.526
or to be willing to let a famous person
put their genitals in your mouth.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.111
Sounds fair. What do you reckon?

20:37.278 --> 20:39.948
I'm not sucking off James Corden
just to get backstage.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.366
OK, let's play a game.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.618
Which celeb would you suck off
to get backstage?

20:43.785 --> 20:44.994
Fun.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.496
Michael Fassbender?

20:46.663 --> 20:47.747
- No.
- Definitely. Next.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.994
- Forest Whitaker?
- I said no to Michael Fassbender.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.684
Why would I say yes to Forest Whitaker?

20:51.834 --> 20:52.961
- Harry Potter!
- What?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.463
- Harry Potter!
- I don't look anything like him.

20:55.630 --> 20:57.298
Harry Potter!

20:57.465 --> 20:59.342
Jesus Christ.

20:59.509 --> 21:02.053
- Is it gonna be three days of this?
- Classic.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.554
OK, let's go pitch our tents.

21:03.721 --> 21:04.889
My usual spot's up that way.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.142
It's right by the main path
and the biggest toilets.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.310
Awesome.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.896
I think Shane and I already
have a spot in mind is the thing.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.189
- Do we?
- Yeah. Remember?

21:13.356 --> 21:15.441
I read about it on that camping blog.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.446
No worries.
Great getting to know you guys.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.032
Good luck meeting Hammerhead.
Hope he likes your tunes.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.617
Bye.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.864
- Where's the spot?
- I made it up to get rid of her.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.038
Why don't you wanna camp with her?
She's cool.

21:29.205 --> 21:32.208
- She's clearly mental.
- She's not mental. She's just Australian.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.285
I will find us the perfect spot.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.465
It's gonna be perfect.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.510
♪ Blaze up me fire,
blaze it till the morning

21:42.760 --> 21:45.888
♪ Blaze up me fire,
blaze it till the morning

21:46.139 --> 21:49.183
♪ Blaze up me fire,
blaze it till the morning

21:49.559 --> 21:51.436
♪ Blaze up me fire

21:52.478 --> 21:54.355
♪ Some of dem evil from dem christen...

21:54.522 --> 21:56.316
This is insane.
There's nowhere left to camp.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.985
When you buy a ticket,
you should be given an allotted space

21:59.152 --> 22:01.988
- with specific GPS coordinates.
- That sounds fun.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.239
Could have gone with Amy.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.491
Oi, fellas!

22:05.700 --> 22:07.785
Oh, fuck. It's Rex.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.246
- What do we do?
- Er... Just wave.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.808
- Maybe we should go over and say hi.
- No, he'll be with Caitlin.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.546
Yeah, but we have to do something.

22:18.713 --> 22:22.300
I don't think we can spend
the whole festival just waving at him.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.522
Yeah, I know, yeah.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.446
Ah... Come on.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.786
Boys. Long time no see. How's shiz?

22:49.952 --> 22:51.245
- Not bad.
- Buzzing to be here.

22:51.412 --> 22:52.413
Nice, nice.

22:52.580 --> 22:53.623
Nick, I've gotta say,

22:53.790 --> 22:57.043
it's great to see you up and about
after that little spaz-out at graduation.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.669
- Er... Thanks.
- Seriously.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.005
If that was me, I'd call it quits
and disappear.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.384
I'd, like, grow a tash, move to Belgium,
open up a fucking waffle house.

23:04.967 --> 23:07.970
But you're not afraid to show your face
in public. Total respect.

23:08.137 --> 23:10.556
- Where are you camping?
- We haven't found anywhere yet.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.283
The only space was next to
a guy who dug a toilet with his hands.

23:13.393 --> 23:16.396
- Why don't you camp here?
- Oh, er... I don't know.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.147
Don't be silly. There's loads of room.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.024
This is primo real estate.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.905
- OK, thanks.
- Hey, no problemo, hombre.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.782
Drop your bags here.

23:27.949 --> 23:30.034
The others are all chilling inside.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.745
Shoes off.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.414
Oh. Yep.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.666
Sorry.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.626
Come on in.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.628
Rex, this tent is amazing.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.338
Holy shit. Is that a wine fridge?

23:42.505 --> 23:43.745
- All right, lads?
- Hey, Gordy.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.716
- Hi, Lucy.
- Oh, hi.

23:45.883 --> 23:48.052
I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.429
What the fuck? I know.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.972
We've met so many times.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.765
No, I don't think so.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.102
- I'm really good with faces.
- My face hasn't changed.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.354
Right, here's the drug sitch.

23:59.564 --> 24:00.982
You hid drugs in a teddy bear?

24:01.149 --> 24:02.483
Mate, I'm fully kitted out.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.652
I'm like the James Bond
of getting off your nut.

24:04.819 --> 24:07.405
We're talking ketamine in the bog roll,

24:07.905 --> 24:09.699
downers in the Right Guard,

24:09.866 --> 24:11.951
uppers in the maracas.

24:12.702 --> 24:13.911
Coke in Mr Teddy.

24:14.287 --> 24:16.164
Don't start without me.

24:16.914 --> 24:19.000
Oh, my God. Nick, hi.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.377
Hello, Caitlin. How are you?

24:21.544 --> 24:24.547
- Good, thanks. How are you?
- Good, thanks. How are you?

24:24.714 --> 24:27.425
- Good, thanks.
- Good, thanks.

24:27.592 --> 24:29.677
How are you?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.138
Wow, this is not fun.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.390
Nothing a few lines won't fix.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.502
Whoa. I kind of assumed it would be,
like, one line each.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.046
One line of coke each?
What is this, Midnight Mass?

25:05.213 --> 25:09.717
Don't worry, there's plenty more
where that came from.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.969
Hang on.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.181
I don't think that was coke.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.766
I got my stashes mixed up.

25:16.933 --> 25:18.643
That was all ketamine.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.687
That's, like, the third time this year.
I've gotta get a fucking pen.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.648
Right, gang,
that's the weekend over for me.

25:23.814 --> 25:26.776
I'm gonna head to my tent, put on some
Norah Jones and ride this one out.

25:26.943 --> 25:29.028
Enjoy the festival.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.573
Well, I don't know about you,

25:32.740 --> 25:35.660
but I didn't bleach my bumhole
to sit around watching Gordy OD.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.329
- Let's get out there.
- That's a good idea.

25:38.496 --> 25:40.456
Caitlin,
do you think we can have a quick chat?

25:40.623 --> 25:43.376
- Sure. What's up?
- I, erm... I like the new hair.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.711
Thanks. Yeah, thought I'd mix it up a bit.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.797
- Not sure it totally worked.
- No, it's good.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.799
Erm... What colour is that?

25:49.966 --> 25:51.842
- Blonde.
- Yeah, no, I just...

25:52.009 --> 25:56.514
Sometimes they have funny names.
Like, erm, Concrete Grey or Yellow...

25:56.681 --> 25:58.766
Yellow.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.644
I just wanted to say I hope
it is OK if we camp with you guys.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.896
- No, yeah, definitely.
- Cool.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.703
It's so great that even after the break-up
we can still be friends.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.735
So great. We don't have to be
one of those terrible couples

26:09.902 --> 26:11.529
who break up and turn into monsters.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.531
God, no. That's not us.

26:13.698 --> 26:15.408
We can have fun this weekend,
just mates.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.368
Yeah, friends.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.000
Hey, do you wanna see something weird?

26:24.166 --> 26:25.960
- Yes.
- Brace yourself.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.212
What is it?

26:28.838 --> 26:30.798
It's Rex's sex box.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.258
Check out the pink thing.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.510
Look at all this different stuff.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.096
Peach lube and flavoured condoms?

26:37.263 --> 26:40.016
How disgusting must his dick taste?

26:40.182 --> 26:41.684
Caitlin, come on, let's go.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.936
Sorry.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.896
- You coming?
- I'm gonna put up my tent.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.941
- But see you guys out there?
- Cool. See you in a bit.

26:50.026 --> 26:53.904
Oh. And I know it's tempting
but try not to lick the sex egg.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.162
I think this weekend's
gonna be really fun.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.748
You know, the sun's out,
the old gang are back together.

27:03.914 --> 27:06.125
- Me and Caitlin are getting on well.
- Good to hear.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.794
Yeah. Yeah.
Just joking around, having fun.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.088
And who knows?
One thing leads to another, we...

27:11.255 --> 27:13.382
I don't know.
I'm not saying we get back together.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.218
- Did something happen?
- No. We were just having a laugh.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.846
- I'm not saying we'll get back together.
- OK, cool.

27:19.013 --> 27:22.284
I'm just saying, you know, one thing leads
to another, maybe we do get back together.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.268
- Wanna get back with her?
- I'm not saying that.

27:24.435 --> 27:28.814
Sounds like you are saying that. Getting
back with an ex is never a good idea.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.109
It's like when you try to use the same
piece of toilet paper to wipe your arse.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.112
You fold it over, pretending
it isn't already covered in crap,

27:35.279 --> 27:38.949
but before you know it there's...
there's shit all over your fingers,

27:39.116 --> 27:41.369
and you're trying to
turn the tap on with your elbows,

27:41.535 --> 27:43.871
and your mum's going mad.
She wants to use the toilet.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.123
What are you talking about?

27:46.290 --> 27:48.959
Please don't make this whole weekend
about you and Caitlin.

27:49.126 --> 27:52.296
- We came here to have fun.
- I am having fun.

27:52.463 --> 27:54.256
Good.

27:54.423 --> 27:55.591
- Done.
- Yeah.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.218
- Looking good.
- Yeah.

27:57.385 --> 27:58.678
All right, let's do yours.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.221
- My what?
- Your tent.

28:00.388 --> 28:01.555
No, I didn't bring a tent.

28:01.722 --> 28:03.265
What? Where are you gonna sleep?

28:03.432 --> 28:04.767
In there, with you.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.602
No, Shane, it's barely big enough for me.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.521
Don't worry, I'm a small sleeper.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.439
- What?
- Shane...

28:10.606 --> 28:12.692
It's so spacious.

- Hi, guys.
- Good news.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.836
We checked on Gordy
and he is definitely still breathing.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.004
Cool. We're gonna
get a couple more drinks here

28:34.171 --> 28:36.966
and then go check out
this Congolese rapper, Yung Boner.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.801
He used to be a child soldier

28:38.968 --> 28:42.805
and then he gave up a full scholarship
to Yale to focus on rapping.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.890
Lucy, by the way.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.101
- Rex? Rex!
- Oh, fuck me.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.062
- The Pirate!
- Hey, hey! Oh, my gosh.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.815
I didn't know you were gonna be here,
you fucking dickweed.

28:52.982 --> 28:56.026
Good to see you, man. Last I heard,
you were in prison in Honduras.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.612
No, no, I just made that up
to get out of a Wonga debt.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.741
Look. I'm working here.
PR, security, band liaison.

29:01.907 --> 29:04.368
I'm basically, like, the go-to guy
for all the artists.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.704
- You know, I mean, it's no big deal.
- Sweet.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.789
Guys, this is The Pirate.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.156
Pirate, these are my uni pals.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.667
Hey. Nice to meet you.

29:11.834 --> 29:13.461
Pirate.

29:13.627 --> 29:15.171
Pirate. Yeah.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.505
- Pirate.
- Nick.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.508
Lick. Your name's fucking Lick?

29:21.427 --> 29:23.512
- No, no. Nick. Lick's not a name.
- Right.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.890
I was wondering why Rex
has a buddy named Lick.

29:26.056 --> 29:29.018
My name's not Lick.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.020
Can you imagine going up
for a job interview

29:31.187 --> 29:34.648
and like, being, like, "What's your name,
son?" "Lick." "Lick?"

29:42.364 --> 29:43.783
You've literally just made this up.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.910
We're gonna
go and check out Yung Boner in a bit.

29:46.076 --> 29:48.204
Absolutely. I love that guy.
I'll see you there.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.080
I gotta get some factor 50
for Thom Yorke.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.333
That guy does not do well in the sun.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.502
Great meeting you guys.

29:54.668 --> 29:55.669
Lick.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.379
Hilarious. Hilarious.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.717
Who the hell calls themselves The Pirate?

30:01.884 --> 30:04.178
What, does he have a parrot and a boat
and only one leg?

30:04.345 --> 30:06.597
He does actually only have one leg, yeah.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.975
He was in a car accident when he was five.
They had to amputate below the knee.

30:10.226 --> 30:12.436
- Oh, my God.
- Poor guy.

30:13.437 --> 30:18.025
That is obviously just so sad and...

30:18.192 --> 30:19.944
and tragic.

30:20.110 --> 30:23.197
But, I mean, there really is
no way I could have known that.

30:23.364 --> 30:26.534
Like, The Rock isn't called The Rock
cos his dad was crushed by a boulder.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.702
Well, who's the other one? The Edge.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.539
He's not called the Edge
cos he nearly fell off a cliff.

30:31.705 --> 30:32.957
A lot of people have nicknames.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.918
You don't immediately think,
"Oh, what's the injury?"

30:36.085 --> 30:38.170
Shall we get that drink?

30:39.713 --> 30:41.757
Yeah, get a... a drink.

30:47.304 --> 30:48.889
Guys. Guys.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.642
Hey. What are you douchebags
doing all the way in the back?

30:51.809 --> 30:53.102
Let's get down to the front.

30:53.269 --> 30:56.230
No, it's much better back here.
And the view's actually pretty good.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.524
The view? The view?

30:58.691 --> 31:01.694
All right, Mister Turner, you stay here
and do your watercolours.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.488
I'm gonna go down front
and feel the full force of his beats.

31:04.655 --> 31:06.282
- Now, who's with me?
- Yeah, I'll come.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.033
- Yes.
- Woo! Woo!

31:08.200 --> 31:09.827
What, you're going too?

31:09.994 --> 31:11.537
What? It looks kind of fun down there.

31:11.704 --> 31:12.955
Crowds are not fun.

31:13.122 --> 31:15.040
Claustrophobia is not fun.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.793
Feeling like you're fleeing a genocide
is not fun.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.922
No, you're right.
Let's, let's just stay here.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.176
- Just go.
- Thank you.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.973
Enjoying the festival?

31:31.140 --> 31:33.058
It's my ninth year. I'm travelling solo.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.894
Such a great way to meet new people.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.145
I think it's free.

31:36.312 --> 31:39.648
Ah, you go ahead.
I don't need the toilet. I'm just hanging.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.151
Enjoying the festival?

31:42.318 --> 31:43.402
It's my ninth year.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.780
I'm travelling solo.
Such a great way to meet new people.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.199
Enjoying the festival?

32:07.635 --> 32:09.261
Sorry, mate.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.722
- Can we stand where you're standing?
- Excuse me?

32:11.889 --> 32:14.099
Me and me mates.
We just want to stand where you are.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.227
OK, but... right here?

32:17.394 --> 32:19.021
There's so much space.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.731
Come on, mate, don't be difficult.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.317
How am I being difficult?
I'm just standing here.

32:23.484 --> 32:25.778
- Yeah, but we want to stand there.
- Let him stand there.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.279
What? Who the fuck are you?

32:27.446 --> 32:29.156
Oi. Don't swear at him.

32:29.323 --> 32:30.866
You're ruining it for everyone.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.201
Just move, mate.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.078
Yeah, go on. Piss off!

32:34.244 --> 32:36.163
What is happening?

32:36.330 --> 32:37.957
What's happening?

32:38.123 --> 32:42.920
Fine, fine. I'm going, I'm going.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.172
- See you, then.
- Dickhead.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.134
Thank you, thank you.

32:49.426 --> 32:51.136
- Nick.
- Dude.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.305
You're even further back? Wow.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.932
Yeah, well, it was great, actually.

32:55.099 --> 32:56.976
Had a lot of personal space,
a panoramic view.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.268
Saw the drummer really well.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.270
Fuck. I think I've lost my phone.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.689
Oh, my God. Are you sure?

33:01.855 --> 33:04.650
Shit. I can't believe I've lost it
on the first day. I'm an idiot.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.235
Oh, hey, everything'll be fine.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.154
It's just a phone. It's only
a few bits of plastic glued together.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.739
There's a bit more to it than that.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.241
We're at a festival, right?

33:12.408 --> 33:15.244
So just think of it as a way to get
into the communal spirit of things.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.246
You know what? I'm jealous.

33:17.413 --> 33:20.708
I think the whole weekend'll be better
without one of these anyways.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.960
Oh, shit.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.337
See that? No phone and I'm still alive.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.547
Oh, my God.

33:26.797 --> 33:29.925
- You didn't have to do that, but thanks.
- I think that hit someone.

33:30.092 --> 33:33.220
Now, who's gonna buy
these two phoneless freaks a drink?

33:33.637 --> 33:34.847
Good idea.

33:35.014 --> 33:36.890
Of course
he's gonna tell Caitlin it's fine.

33:37.057 --> 33:39.727
I mean, after you've lost a leg,
I'm sure a phone's nothing.

33:39.893 --> 33:43.313
- You're annoyed cos he calls you Lick.
- It's not even a name!

33:45.399 --> 33:48.694
Look, I think I'm gonna try
and find Caitlin's phone.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.821
Oh, my God,
you are trying to get back with her.

33:50.988 --> 33:52.114
No.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.657
You saw how upset she was.

33:54.116 --> 33:56.827
Dude, just leave it. Let's get drunk
and do literally anything else.

33:56.994 --> 33:58.203
Trust me.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.997
You've gotta trust me.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.999
Because I know what I'm doing.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.544
<i>OK, that was Yung Boner.</i>

34:05.711 --> 34:07.379
<i>Give it up for Yung Boner.</i>

34:07.546 --> 34:10.466
<i>Just to let you know,
the food trucks have opened up back there.</i>

34:10.632 --> 34:12.051
Sorry. Sorry about that.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.886
<i>We've got the next band coming on.</i>

34:14.053 --> 34:16.221
<i>Two young ladies
from Silver Lake in Los Angeles.</i>

34:16.388 --> 34:17.681
<i>Are you ready?</i>

34:17.848 --> 34:19.975
<i>Give it up for Deap Vally!</i>

34:20.141 --> 34:21.143
Phone.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.145
Do you mind if I...? I'm just gonna...

34:24.605 --> 34:26.190
I'm sorry.

34:26.356 --> 34:29.234
Can I just get that? Can I get it?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.737
Can I get...? There's a...

34:33.822 --> 34:35.908
See it.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.505
Yes!

34:50.297 --> 34:52.382
Eugh!

34:53.050 --> 34:54.467
What the fuck? You're pissing.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.011
Yeah.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.555
Why are you pissing?
You just pissed on me.

34:58.722 --> 34:59.807
It's the front, mate.

34:59.973 --> 35:02.059
I mean, you're still pissing?

35:03.560 --> 35:05.104
Yeah.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.688
Fuck me. Sorry.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.441
Sorry. Sorry.

35:09.608 --> 35:12.653
Hammerhead is literally the most
in-demand DJ in the world.

35:12.820 --> 35:14.696
You know he played
at Robert Mugabe's 90th?

35:14.863 --> 35:17.991
It looks like Caitlin's
finally gonna end her dry spell.

35:18.158 --> 35:19.368
- What?
- Look at her.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.662
She's so obviously into The Pirate.

35:21.829 --> 35:24.790
She's picked a good 'un.
Between us, he's got a big old cock.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.649
He calls it the plank,
but we used to call it his second leg.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.171
Oh, man, Nick'll be gutted.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.507
Why?
It's been ages since they broke up.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.634
Plus they're not exactly well suited.

35:35.801 --> 35:40.556
Caitlin's, like, fun and, like, cool,
and Nick's just so...

35:40.722 --> 35:43.183
- Nickish.
- Yeah, Nickish, exactly.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.144
- What do you mean?
- It's hard to explain.

35:45.602 --> 35:49.565
It's just when he's around,
stuff is kind of much less fun.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.651
Yeah, first time I met him, I told him
about my gap year in Australia

35:52.818 --> 35:55.195
and he kept talking about
Aboriginal discrimination.

35:55.362 --> 35:58.907
Like, bloody hell, just because some
convicts massacred a bunch of tribes,

35:59.074 --> 36:00.868
suddenly I can't go skydiving.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.995
Hello.

36:03.162 --> 36:05.080
Guys, good news.

36:09.793 --> 36:13.088
Gordy?

36:13.463 --> 36:14.923
You all right?

36:15.090 --> 36:16.133
You shaved your head.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.385
All right? I said I'm...

36:18.552 --> 36:20.679
Gordy, do you know where Caitlin
and the others are?

36:22.431 --> 36:23.515
It's just, er...

36:23.682 --> 36:27.436
Caitlin lost her phone and I went
to look for it, as a friend, obviously,

36:27.603 --> 36:31.857
erm... and I wanna return it to her, so
should I wait in there till they get back?

36:33.650 --> 36:35.527
Yeah, good idea. I'll just wait in there.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.113
You cool there, mate?

36:38.280 --> 36:41.158
Yeah. Well, look, let me know
if you need anything.

36:42.743 --> 36:46.038
OK, so I hope one of you guys is
gonna give me an appreciative rim job.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.248
Pirate just got us VIP wristbands.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.626
Check 'em out.
These bad boys'll get you backstage.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.920
I don't mean to blow
my own massive dick or anything

36:53.086 --> 36:55.088
but I am in pretty tight
with all the acts,

36:55.255 --> 36:57.966
so if you play your cards right,
I might even introduce you.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.093
Holy shit. I'm gonna meet Hammerhead.

37:00.385 --> 37:04.056
Yeah, see, the thing is, I could
only get three wristbands, so...

37:04.556 --> 37:06.642
You understand, right?

37:07.226 --> 37:08.894
Yeah. Yeah.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.312
It's fine.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.731
Sorry... mate.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.298
You don't remember my name, do you?

37:14.441 --> 37:16.193
I wanna say Dougie.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.492
"Nick, what are you doing in here?"
I found your phone.

37:23.659 --> 37:25.953
"Oh, my God,
Nick, you're incredible."

37:26.119 --> 37:29.456
Incredible is a strong word, Caitlin,
but, yeah, I'll take it.

37:29.623 --> 37:31.208
"Oh, kiss me."

37:31.375 --> 37:33.835
What? But, Caitlin, we're broken up.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.880
"I don't care. I want you inside me."

37:51.520 --> 37:53.605
Oh, shit.

37:56.733 --> 37:58.235
Fuck.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.955
- Do you smell piss?
- Who cares?

38:10.122 --> 38:11.915
- Mm.
- Let me get this off.

38:32.227 --> 38:33.603
Six years ago, did it.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.397
Five years ago, did it.

38:35.564 --> 38:36.773
Four years ago, did it.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.567
Three years ago, did it.

38:38.734 --> 38:40.777
Two years ago, did it.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.279
One year ago, did it.

38:42.446 --> 38:44.781
You guys look like
you're having great fun.

38:46.199 --> 38:48.285
I'm Amy, by the way.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.829
- Oh, Caitlin.
- Oh, Pirate.

38:51.038 --> 38:53.373
- Oh, Caitlin.
- Oh, Pirate.

38:53.707 --> 38:57.169
- Oh, Caitlin.
- Oh, Pirate.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.588
You wanna walk the plank,
you naughty girl?

38:59.755 --> 39:01.673
Yeah, I wanna walk the plank.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.925
Yeah? Yeah? OK.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.553
You need to walk the plank.

39:06.720 --> 39:08.430
Here we go.

39:13.185 --> 39:15.062
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.438
- Oh, shit!
- Sorry...

39:16.605 --> 39:18.482
- Lick!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.234
It isn't that bad.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.611
It was a misunderstanding.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.072
It must happen all the time.

39:25.238 --> 39:28.116
Yeah. She's probably really happy
you gave her phone back.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.369
- Exactly.
- Guys?

39:30.911 --> 39:31.995
Listen, guys...

39:32.162 --> 39:34.247
Fuck me, what's that smell?

39:35.415 --> 39:37.125
Oh. A man pissed on me earlier.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.044
Can you just come out here, please?

39:43.924 --> 39:45.592
So, we were having a chat

39:45.759 --> 39:48.470
and we were thinking maybe you guys
shouldn't stay here any more.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.389
What? We're not sex offenders.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.973
Nick, it's been decided.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.268
Oh, it's been decided, has it?
Sorry, we actually live in a democracy.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.020
We didn't fight Hitler

39:57.187 --> 40:00.399
so that people like you could go around
just telling other people

40:00.565 --> 40:02.317
where they can be at festivals.

40:02.484 --> 40:04.444
We should at least have a vote.

40:05.362 --> 40:07.823
- Fine, we'll vote.
- Fine.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.117
Those in favour of us staying.

40:10.283 --> 40:12.369
Those in favour of them leaving.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.790
What about Gordy? Gordy hasn't voted.
Gordy gets a vote.

40:16.957 --> 40:19.167
Gordy, do you want me and Shane to stay?

40:19.334 --> 40:21.086
If you do, raise your hand.

40:26.675 --> 40:29.010
There you go. Three all. Unlucky, Rex.

40:29.177 --> 40:32.055
- What about me? I didn't get to vote.
- You're not part of the group.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.474
He's having sex with Caitlin.
He's part of the group.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.726
"He's having sex with Caitlin."
Fine, new vote.

40:36.893 --> 40:38.103
Is Pirate part of the group?

40:38.270 --> 40:39.980
If you think he is, raise your hand.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.316
One, two, three. That's a tie.

40:43.483 --> 40:45.569
Oh, Gordy, for fuck's sake!

No, this way.

♪ Text me back

41:01.209 --> 41:02.878
I think it was this way.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.963

41:05.130 --> 41:07.549
Bet you're glad now we've only
got one tent. Less to carry.

41:07.716 --> 41:09.259
- Please stop talking.
- Just saying.

41:09.426 --> 41:11.186
Cos we've been walking
for a long time and...

41:11.595 --> 41:12.804
Just no talking at all.

41:12.971 --> 41:17.642
♪ Nothing good happens past 2am

41:34.409 --> 41:36.495

How did it get so hot?

41:41.249 --> 41:43.335
My balls are sopping wet.

41:44.794 --> 41:48.006
I feel like it's brighter in here
than it is just outside.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.890

What are you guys doing here?

42:02.270 --> 42:05.315
- There's nowhere else left to camp.
- Nick got caught watching his ex

42:05.482 --> 42:07.901
- suck off a guy with one leg.
- Ah, rookie mistake.

42:08.068 --> 42:10.820
I can't believe it.
The train gang are back together.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.989
I'm gonna show you guys the best time.

42:13.156 --> 42:15.158
- What shall we do first?
- Well, I stink of piss.

42:15.325 --> 42:17.244
I should probably do something
about that.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.120
What about you, Shane?
Gonna scrub up?

42:19.287 --> 42:20.455
No.

42:20.872 --> 42:21.957
Au naturel. I like it.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.751
Embracing the stink
is what festivals are all about.

42:24.918 --> 42:27.462
Before we head off, we should
probably get some breakfast.

42:27.629 --> 42:28.672
Is that all you're having?

42:28.838 --> 42:31.675
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Got almonds in it. It's something.

42:31.841 --> 42:34.844
Shane, you can't just eat Toblerone
like some weirdo autistic prince.

42:35.011 --> 42:37.097
Here, have some proper food.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.060
- What the hell is that?
- Chaffney.

42:42.227 --> 42:44.354
- Chaffney?
- It's a family recipe.

42:44.521 --> 42:46.565
Chaffney is a delicious all-in-one stew

42:46.731 --> 42:49.025
jam-packed with every nutrient
you need to survive.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.444
One bite of Chaffney
will keep you going for hours.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.822
Chaffney is the perfect festival food.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.335
- That is incredible.
- Told you.

43:07.502 --> 43:09.337
Dude, Amy's sorted us breakfast.

43:09.504 --> 43:12.966
Get some of this down you.
Then we'll get this show on the road.

43:14.175 --> 43:15.927
- I'll buy something.
- Suit yourself.

43:16.094 --> 43:19.055
While we're out and about, you can
spend £20 on some fancy burger

43:19.222 --> 43:22.475
that's probably full of horsemeat,
Shane and I will fill up on Chaffney.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.811
Full disclosure:
there is horsemeat in Chaffney.

43:24.978 --> 43:26.938
Let's get ready.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.190

better when you're not on your own.

44:55.652 --> 44:57.070
Thanks for showing us around, Amy.

44:57.237 --> 44:59.656
It's been the best day
since Robin broke both his ankles.

44:59.823 --> 45:01.616
I haven't sat down in, like, nine hours.

45:01.783 --> 45:03.618
They should have
more places to sit down.

45:03.785 --> 45:05.870
And also it's too muddy.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.915
Oh, shit.

45:09.082 --> 45:10.542
Hi, guys.

45:10.709 --> 45:12.127
- Hey.
- Hi.

45:12.293 --> 45:15.839
Listen, I know things got a little bit
weird last night after what you guys did,

45:16.005 --> 45:17.924
but it's water under the bridge.

45:18.091 --> 45:20.301
- I didn't do anything.
- Apology accepted.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.053
To be honest, we've had a great day.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.763
You know me, just going with the flow.

45:23.930 --> 45:26.182
We found a great new place to camp
next to the toilets.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.018
I've had a wash. I don't smell of piss
any more. Not very much.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.437
Basically it's all chill.

45:30.603 --> 45:31.980
Harry Potter!

45:32.147 --> 45:34.190
- Harry Potter!
- Hey, who's your buddy, Lick?

45:34.357 --> 45:35.859
Oh, I don't know him, but he's funny.

45:36.109 --> 45:37.485
- All right, mate?
- Harry Potter!

45:37.652 --> 45:41.072
Harry Potter. I mean, I do not look
like Harry Potter at all.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.240
Oh...

45:42.407 --> 45:44.242
One person I do not look like
is Harry Potter.

45:44.617 --> 45:46.095
Come on, Harry, let's play Quidditch.

45:46.119 --> 45:47.495
Yeah! Oh.

45:47.662 --> 45:49.706
That's not how you play Quidditch.

45:49.873 --> 45:52.542
What have you been watching?
Fucking hell.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.836
Can someone get him off?
Oh, shit.

45:56.713 --> 45:58.590
Help. Can someone get him off?

45:58.757 --> 46:00.508
Harry, go on. Catch this.

46:00.717 --> 46:03.052
- Can someone get him off? He's mental.
- Harry Potter!

46:03.219 --> 46:05.638
- Oh, my God. Indian street food.
- It's Harry Potter.

46:05.805 --> 46:07.891
Yeah. I know. Harry Potter.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.227
- Nick.
- Nick.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.271
It's just mud,
with a bit of shit mixed in.

46:13.438 --> 46:15.815
Guys, seriously, I'm through.

46:15.982 --> 46:19.152
The only person who will ever love me

46:19.319 --> 46:20.862
and her new fuck buddy

46:21.029 --> 46:22.280
just watched me drink mud.

46:22.447 --> 46:23.656
I am done.

46:23.823 --> 46:26.618
I just want to go back to the tent
and hide there

46:26.785 --> 46:28.578
until this fucking festival is over

46:28.745 --> 46:31.915
and I can go home and have
a proper shower and a poo.

46:34.334 --> 46:36.419
Nick.

46:39.756 --> 46:42.175
- Shall we go with him?
- Nah, he's all right.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.428
He gets like this.
The trick is to give him some space.

46:45.595 --> 46:47.931
In that case,
do you wanna do something cool?

46:48.097 --> 46:49.224
Yes.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.184
In the woods behind the hippie field

46:51.518 --> 46:54.687
there's a stone circle with a rock
that looks just like Mark Ruffalo.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.565
I've always been too spooked
to go by myself.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.860
- Do you wanna go check it out?
- Yes, I love rocks that look like things.

47:01.027 --> 47:03.947
♪ Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now

47:04.113 --> 47:06.783
♪ I been feeling it since 1966, now

47:06.950 --> 47:09.828
♪ Might have had your fill,
but you feel it still...

47:13.498 --> 47:16.417
And that's why I left Australia at 16
with nothing but a backpack

47:16.584 --> 47:18.211
and my grandad's World War II revolver.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.296
Obviously they took that
off me at Customs.

47:20.463 --> 47:21.548
How do you know Nick?

47:21.714 --> 47:23.554
We lived next door
to each other in first year.

47:23.842 --> 47:25.762
I was cooking pasta
and I set my curtains on fire

47:25.927 --> 47:27.720
and Nick came in
and helped me put them out,

47:27.887 --> 47:29.722
and he's been looking out for me
ever since.

47:29.889 --> 47:32.433
- What are your friends like?
- I don't really have any.

47:32.600 --> 47:36.813
People tend to hang out with me for a bit
and then, I don't know, stop.

47:36.980 --> 47:39.190
My mum says I'm like a little bush fire:

47:39.357 --> 47:42.360
exciting at first but you don't want it
anywhere near your house.

47:42.527 --> 47:44.279
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure thing.

47:44.445 --> 47:46.072
- Are we lost?
- No, no, no, no.

47:46.239 --> 47:49.993
Because that was East, so we're headed
West, because that's the North Star up...

47:50.159 --> 47:52.245
That's the moon. Yeah, we're lost.

47:52.662 --> 47:55.540
Ah-oo-wen, ah-oo-wen...

47:55.707 --> 47:57.542
Hey, can you hear that?

47:58.751 --> 48:00.295
Yeah.

48:00.461 --> 48:05.425
Ah-oo-wen, ah-oo-wen...

48:05.592 --> 48:10.471
Ah-oo-wen, ah-oo-wen...

48:11.264 --> 48:16.227
Ah-oo-wen, ah-oo-wen...

48:17.186 --> 48:18.563
What is that?

48:18.730 --> 48:21.149
Maybe they're filming an advert.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.067
For what?

48:23.234 --> 48:25.028
Fire?

48:25.194 --> 48:27.947
This is creeping me out.
I think we should leave.

48:28.948 --> 48:31.993
Who dares enter our sacred grove?

48:35.163 --> 48:37.874
- Please don't eat us.
- I know I look athletic but it's all fat.

48:38.041 --> 48:42.670
Why do people always assume
we're going to eat them?

48:43.796 --> 48:46.841
We're Druids,

48:47.008 --> 48:48.134
not cannibals.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.345
Whoa. You guys are Druids?

48:50.511 --> 48:53.556
I'm Brother Julian,
High Priest of this sect.

48:53.723 --> 48:55.516
I'm really sorry if we scared you.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.895
We thought you might be
a couple of those Wiccan pricks.

49:00.229 --> 49:03.191
You've stumbled upon
our annual summer solstice celebration.

49:03.358 --> 49:06.027
But this year is extra special.

49:06.653 --> 49:09.030
My son David is taking a bride.

49:09.197 --> 49:11.658
Oh, congrats. We'll get out of your hair.

49:11.824 --> 49:14.619
- Yeah, we don't wanna crash.
- No, no. This is a joyous occasion.

49:14.786 --> 49:18.790
As father of the groom, it's my duty
to invite you to join in our festivities.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.583
Oh, well...

49:20.750 --> 49:24.170
- There's a hog roast.
- That could actually be great.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.631
- We haven't had any hot food.
- Pork would be nice.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.592
Libations for our guests.

49:30.718 --> 49:31.928
Plastic cups OK?

49:36.182 --> 49:38.267
Aagh!

49:38.893 --> 49:41.104
- Shit.
- Argh.

49:41.270 --> 49:42.522
Shit. Are you OK?

49:42.689 --> 49:44.107
The security prick's chasing me.

49:44.273 --> 49:46.693
- You've got to hide me.
- Er... You can hide in my tent.

49:47.110 --> 49:48.945
Great. Thanks.

49:50.571 --> 49:52.240
Hello, Officer.

49:52.407 --> 49:54.492
What a fine summer's eve it is.

49:57.412 --> 49:59.414
Coast is clear.

49:59.580 --> 50:02.166
What was that "summer's eve" shit?

50:02.333 --> 50:04.085
I panicked. Why was he chasing you?

50:04.252 --> 50:06.337
Caught me stealing fruit
from Tame Impala's yurt.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.464
Just had to get me bowels moving.

50:08.631 --> 50:11.634
- You're a Smurf.
- Yeah, hen do. We've all come as Smurfs.

50:11.801 --> 50:14.303
Got split up a couple of hours ago
when I went out on the rob.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.790
If I see loads of Smurfs,
I'll say you're looking for them.

50:16.931 --> 50:20.935
Don't bother. I've got all the MDMA,
so it's actually worked out really well.

50:21.102 --> 50:22.770
Hey, I totally owe you.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.772
- Do you fancy a bit?
- Oh, no, thanks.

50:24.939 --> 50:28.026
- I'm... full.
- Full?

50:28.192 --> 50:30.194
- Also I'm not really in the mood.
- Huh!

50:30.361 --> 50:33.906
That's exactly why this stuff was
invented. Come on. It'll be fun.

50:35.408 --> 50:37.285
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Oh, don't worry.

50:37.452 --> 50:40.997
My girlfriend's had them tested.
There's no cement mix in these ones.

50:41.164 --> 50:43.833
- I don't know.
- Maybe just start with a half?

50:47.378 --> 50:50.173
Come on. Open wide.

50:56.888 --> 50:57.930
Good boy.

50:58.097 --> 51:01.559
I'm not gonna imagine my dick's a sausage
and start trying to fry it, am I?

51:01.726 --> 51:03.686
Guess we'll find out.

51:49.690 --> 51:51.484
I do trust
you're enjoying yourselves.

51:51.651 --> 51:53.291
Would you care for another cup of Pimm's?

51:53.444 --> 51:55.530
Oh, I don't mind if I do. Thank you.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.990
Ah, I'd like you to meet my son.

51:58.157 --> 51:59.408
The lucky man.

51:59.575 --> 52:02.036
- Great to meet you, Brother David.
- Yeah, congrats.

52:02.203 --> 52:03.871
Are you nervous?

52:04.038 --> 52:05.873
Is it that obvious?

52:06.958 --> 52:09.168
I'm only joking.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.882
No, I've been looking forward to this
for months.

52:13.047 --> 52:16.134
A wedding is the most incredible day
of any Druid's life.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.761
Thanks for letting us stay.
Tonight's been awesome.

52:18.928 --> 52:22.056
You know, I am so glad
that you're enjoying yourselves.

52:22.223 --> 52:24.559
Not always the case with outsiders.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.019
How could anyone not love you guys?

52:27.186 --> 52:31.732
Oh, I don't know. I think they just find
our customs a bit odd and confusing.

52:31.899 --> 52:33.234
But who are they to judge?

52:33.401 --> 52:35.611
We're just a little bit different,
that's all.

52:35.778 --> 52:39.782
And there is nothing wrong
with being a little bit different.

52:40.408 --> 52:42.535
Yeah, we are normal people, really.

52:42.702 --> 52:43.828
Dad's a lawyer.

52:43.995 --> 52:46.414
Sister Mary over there
is a thoracic surgeon.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.708
- I'm a music manager.
- No way!

52:48.875 --> 52:50.918
A few of my clients
are playing at the festival.

52:51.085 --> 52:54.255
TurboChair, Telephone Telephone,
Hammerhead...

52:54.422 --> 52:56.340
You represent Hammerhead?
He's amazing.

52:56.507 --> 52:59.719
Yeah? Well, if you like,
you can take these wristbands

52:59.886 --> 53:01.512
and watch his set from backstage

53:01.679 --> 53:02.805
and maybe even meet him.

53:02.972 --> 53:05.016
Are you serious?

53:05.183 --> 53:07.977
Anything for a fellow Druid.

53:08.144 --> 53:10.229
The nuptial horn bloweth.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.940
It's time for the binding ceremony.

53:13.107 --> 53:14.400
The binding ceremony?

53:14.567 --> 53:17.695
Yes. It's the most cherished part
of the marriage ritual.

53:17.862 --> 53:20.156
No union is sacred without it.

53:20.323 --> 53:22.867
- We're honoured to be a part of this.
- Oh...

53:23.034 --> 53:25.453
Brothers and Sisters,

53:25.620 --> 53:31.751
the time has come for Brother David to be
bound to his new wife for all eternity,

53:32.501 --> 53:34.545
under the light of the moon.

53:34.712 --> 53:37.215
- Ah-oo-wen, Ah-oo-wen...
- Oh, no.

53:37.381 --> 53:40.843
I've heard about this sort of thing.
I think they're gonna sacrifice the goat.

53:41.010 --> 53:42.053
Oh, shit.

53:42.511 --> 53:44.013
Let the binding commence.

53:46.265 --> 53:48.476
- OK, what's happening now?
- I don't know.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.978
Brother Julian, what's going on?

53:51.145 --> 53:53.689
Well, my son is about to be
bound to his new bride.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.691
Oh, but I thought that was his wife.

53:55.858 --> 53:57.610
No, no.

53:57.777 --> 54:00.363
- No, David is marrying the goat.
- The binding.

54:02.782 --> 54:04.283
Ooh.

54:04.450 --> 54:05.660
- Oh, my God.
- Fucking hell.

54:05.826 --> 54:08.454
The binding, the binding.

54:08.621 --> 54:10.206
Ooh hoo!

54:10.373 --> 54:13.668
The binding, the binding.

54:16.545 --> 54:18.965
It's so fucking great
we can use your car for this.

54:19.131 --> 54:21.384
What? Thought this was your car.

54:21.550 --> 54:24.053
- No. I don't have a car.
- Oh.

54:24.220 --> 54:26.889
Whose car is this?
How did we even get in here?

54:27.056 --> 54:29.058
Fuck it. Who cares?

54:29.225 --> 54:30.935
You're so naughty.

54:31.102 --> 54:32.353
It's amazing.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.146
Everything's amazing.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.649
You're sitting on my penis.
That's amazing.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.237
- I love you.
- I love you too.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.253
Shit.

55:00.131 --> 55:01.549
That's not good.

55:13.269 --> 55:15.980
- What the hell are you doing in my car?
- Oh, shit.

55:16.147 --> 55:17.732
Sorry, sorry.

55:17.898 --> 55:19.567
Sorry, mate. I'm sorry.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.652
The car's fine.

55:22.695 --> 55:25.156
Oh, fuck.
I thought it was her car.

55:26.949 --> 55:28.284
It was a romantic gesture!

55:28.451 --> 55:30.161
Oi! Get back here now!

55:30.619 --> 55:32.413
I'm gonna call the police!

55:50.264 --> 55:52.600
- Good morning, Amy.
- Good morning, Shane.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.482
This weather.

55:59.648 --> 56:01.025
Wind.

56:01.192 --> 56:03.277
Blow... Blows.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.907
So last night was pretty weird, wasn't it?

56:08.074 --> 56:10.659
Oh, my God, it was so weird!
It went on for so long.

56:10.826 --> 56:13.079
I didn't know it was possible
to have sex for that long.

56:13.245 --> 56:16.624
I think it's one of those things that
might make a funny anecdote one day.

56:16.791 --> 56:19.126
Obviously right now,
it's just incredibly horrific.

56:19.293 --> 56:21.962
Let's just never talk about it ever again.
Take it to our graves.

56:22.129 --> 56:24.507
Good idea. I'm already taking
12 other things to my grave,

56:24.673 --> 56:26.133
so I can always add something else.

56:27.343 --> 56:28.969
Nick, where have you been?

56:29.136 --> 56:30.262
Are you OK?

56:30.429 --> 56:32.765
Yeah. Yeah, I'm better than OK.

56:32.932 --> 56:35.351
I just had the best night
of my entire life.

56:35.518 --> 56:38.020
I met this... this Smurf.

56:38.187 --> 56:39.605
It's all a bit of a daze.

56:39.772 --> 56:41.482
I remember laughing and dancing.

56:41.649 --> 56:43.317
We definitely had sex.

56:43.484 --> 56:45.694
- Oh, yeah. I've got this now.
- Holy shit.

56:45.861 --> 56:46.987
Is that a nipple piercing?

56:47.154 --> 56:50.366
I've got no idea where that came from.
Also, I don't know where Smurf Girl is.

56:50.533 --> 56:54.036
- I woke up this morning and she was gone.
- The perfect festival romance.

56:54.203 --> 56:56.914
She's amazing. I've never felt
that connected to anyone, ever.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.874
- Been taking drugs?
- She was incredible.

56:59.041 --> 57:02.378
Like some beautiful, crazy angel.

57:02.545 --> 57:03.921
Yeah, you've been taking drugs.

57:04.088 --> 57:06.090
And then... she was gone.

57:06.257 --> 57:08.008
A Smurf wouldn't be too hard to find.

57:08.175 --> 57:10.177
Yeah,
I should totally go and try and find her.

57:10.344 --> 57:12.263
Yes, this is what festivals are all about.

57:12.430 --> 57:14.014
- Great. Come on, Shane.
- Yeah, cool.

57:14.181 --> 57:17.184
Although you're not gonna believe this.
We've backstage wristbands.

57:17.351 --> 57:20.354
So we can see Hammerhead's set up close,
maybe even meet him.

57:20.521 --> 57:22.606
Really? How'd you manage that?

57:23.065 --> 57:26.026
Hm. It's not important.
But I really can't miss Hammerhead.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.820
So maybe we could find Smurf Girl after.

57:28.028 --> 57:29.468
Hammerhead's not on for eight hours.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.073
- Nick, I know, but...
- Shane.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.826
You told me I should come here
to get over Caitlin. This is it.

57:33.993 --> 57:35.369
I have to find this girl.

57:35.536 --> 57:38.914
I promise we'll see Hammerhead tonight.
I promise.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.835
Yeah, cool, definitely.

57:43.002 --> 57:45.504
Woo! Looks like we've got ourselves
a search party.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.799
This is just like the time
my cousin Sandy was kidnapped.

57:50.843 --> 57:53.512
OK, so the potential love of my life
is somewhere down there.

57:53.679 --> 57:55.306
- What's the plan?
- I don't wanna brag,

57:55.473 --> 57:58.267
but I'm something of an expert
when it comes to missing persons.

57:58.434 --> 58:00.269
I'm a bit of a true crime nut.

58:00.436 --> 58:02.813
Now, Nick,
I know this is a tough time for you,

58:02.980 --> 58:04.773
but I need you to describe her genitals.

58:04.940 --> 58:06.942
She's not missing.
I just don't know where she is.

58:07.109 --> 58:10.362
- What does she look like?
- Blonde, I think.

58:10.905 --> 58:13.073
- Sort of a face.
- Sort of face.

58:13.824 --> 58:16.660
- OK. What's her name?
- I don't know.

58:17.036 --> 58:18.138
You don't even know her name?

58:18.162 --> 58:21.749
In cases like this, it's almost always
a jilted lover or a work colleague.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.542
Did she mention any enemies?

58:23.709 --> 58:25.711
This isn't a murder investigation.
She's not dead.

58:25.878 --> 58:27.922
Not yet.
But these first 48 hours are crucial.

58:28.088 --> 58:30.925
Your piercing. Whoever gave you that
must know about Smurf Girl.

58:31.342 --> 58:33.844
- Yes, good thinking.
- Our first clue.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.429
I just hope we're not too late.

58:35.596 --> 58:37.056
Seriously, you've gotta stop that.

58:37.223 --> 58:40.518
After The Afterparty

58:45.022 --> 58:46.398
No.

58:49.902 --> 58:51.237
- No.
- Sure?

58:51.403 --> 58:52.446
Yeah.

58:53.155 --> 58:54.532
Yeah, this one.

58:56.617 --> 58:59.286
- The scene of the crime.
- We should split up and look for clues.

58:59.453 --> 59:02.331
Split up? The place is six foot wide.
How are we meant to split up?

59:02.498 --> 59:07.461
Oi. I said if I caught you nicking again,
I'd pierce your little arseholes closed.

59:07.628 --> 59:09.588
Fuck me. Here he is.

59:09.755 --> 59:12.007
Do you remember me?
Was I here last night with a girl?

59:12.174 --> 59:13.926
- With that blue nutter.
- That's her.

59:14.093 --> 59:17.304
Did she say anything about where she was
going, where she's camping, her name?

59:17.471 --> 59:20.307
Nah, nah. She was properly spangled.

59:20.474 --> 59:22.101
And so were you. Do you remember?

59:22.268 --> 59:25.104
Kept saying your knob's a sausage,
you were gonna cook it and eat it.

59:25.271 --> 59:26.981
Oh, it was mega lols, innit?

59:27.147 --> 59:29.942
Maybe you shouldn't give piercings
to people who are off their face.

59:32.945 --> 59:34.238
What?

59:36.156 --> 59:39.118
You questioning my professionalism?
Is that what you're doing?

59:39.285 --> 59:40.828
You cheeky little prick.

59:40.995 --> 59:45.541
In all my years - three years I've been
tattooing - no one's ever said that to me.

59:45.874 --> 59:49.545
I would never pierce anyone who was
not in the right frame of mind, all right?

59:49.712 --> 59:52.256
You already had that shit piercing
when you came in here.

59:52.423 --> 59:53.716
Oh. Sorry.

59:54.550 --> 59:58.470
If Nick already had the piercing,
then why would he come here?

59:58.637 --> 01:00:01.890
- Because I did his tattoo.
- Oh, right.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:06.812
What does it say?

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.189
It says, "My name's not Lick."

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:10.357
Oh.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.818
Yeah, you were very insistent about that.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:14.528
I like it!

01:00:16.113 --> 01:00:18.490
Great, so I've got a tattoo,
a nipple piercing

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.534
and I'm no closer to finding Smurf Girl.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.036
Oi, hang on, hang on.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.997
You did leave this behind.

01:00:39.345 --> 01:00:41.430
Oh, shit.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.772
You've got a lot of nerve.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.523
You back to finish off the job?

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.693
- Did I do all this?
- You and that bright blue mentalist.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.279
The two of you
came running through here at 5am,

01:00:57.446 --> 01:00:58.906
you said you were a Viking army

01:00:59.073 --> 01:01:01.575
and that you were going to pillage
the living shit out of us.

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:03.285
I am so sorry.

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:05.788
I was off my head
on some very powerful drugs.

01:01:05.954 --> 01:01:08.957
- Yeah, that was pretty obvious.
- And Gordy's missing.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:12.294
Did you fucking steal Gordy?
Cos I swear to God, if you stole Gordy...

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.046
I didn't steal Gordy.

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:15.464
At least, I don't think I did.

01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:17.549
Hey, look who it is. Genghis Cunt.

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:19.218
Pirate, I am so, so sorry about this.

01:01:19.385 --> 01:01:22.179
Yeah, well, you should be.
That was some really messed-up shit.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:26.600
I know that an apology probably isn't
enough, but I... I brought back your leg.

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.353
That's not my leg.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.981
- What?
- That is not my leg.

01:01:36.235 --> 01:01:39.071
Oh, Jesus. How many one-legged people
are at this festival?

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:40.823
Look, what do you want, Nick?

01:01:40.989 --> 01:01:42.783
I'm trying to find that girl I was with.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.245
I woke up this morning and she was gone.
I don't remember her name or anything

01:01:46.412 --> 01:01:48.747
and I just wondered whether
maybe one of you guys...

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.333
God, this is so typical of you, Nick.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.293
You've trashed our campsite

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:55.796
because you were tweaking
on crystal meth or whatever,

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:58.590
but instead of apologising
or offering to make it right,

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.300
you're just thinking about yourself.

01:02:01.552 --> 01:02:03.762
- I just really need to find her.
- Fuck off, Nick.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.598
- Yeah, go away.
- You heard 'em, Lick.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.562
And you better find Gordy.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:13.897
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.441
I'm not, because of this.

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:18.736
- What's that?
- That, my friend, is a Chaffney bar.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:20.237
A whole meal's worth of Chaffney

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.698
compressed into a snack
for the gentleman on the go.

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:24.032
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.909
Been trying to get them into supermarkets.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.997
So far I've had rejection letters from
Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons,

01:02:30.164 --> 01:02:33.000
Iceland, the Co-op, Budgens, Lidl
and Poundstretcher.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.377
But I've got a good feeling
about Waitrose.

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:37.296
Dude, how'd it go?

01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.256
Yeah, it was really great, actually.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:41.800
- Really?
- Obviously not. Worst thing ever.

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:43.594
Worse than your breakdown at graduation?

01:02:43.761 --> 01:02:46.513
Worse than that time you watched
your ex giving a pirate a BJ?

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.351
I'm such an idiot.

01:02:51.518 --> 01:02:52.838
Why did I think I could be happy?

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:55.439
I should have accepted some people
aren't meant to be happy

01:02:55.606 --> 01:02:57.691
and I'm one of them.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:02.654
Bummer.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.308
If only you'd fallen for a Minion.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:09.453
- I see those blue guys all the time.
- What?

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:11.580
There's a group of girls
dressed as Minions,

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:14.666
all painted blue, white hats...
think it's, like, a hen do.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:17.711
They're always hanging out
at that cocktail bar down there.

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.172
Nick. Nick!

01:03:20.339 --> 01:03:22.633
♪ So go ahead and prove me right

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.426
♪ Cos that's what girls like

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:26.011
♪ I know what boys like

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:27.930
♪ I know what they want

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.182
♪ They want that good thing
- Hi, guys. All right?

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:31.869

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:33.936
Hi, excuse me.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:35.938
Oh, you're not gonna like this.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:37.105
Oi.

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:38.482
Oi! What you doing?

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:42.194
That's really bad. I'm so sorry. Just
really quickly, I'm looking for a Smurf.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:43.695
I think she might be with you.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:46.156
- Who's asking?
- Sorry, I'm Nick.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:47.491
I was with her last night.

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.452
We erm... well, kind of got together,
to be honest.

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:54.248
I just really need to see her again.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.542
Do you have any idea where she might be?

01:03:56.708 --> 01:03:59.253
Why would I give my mate's number
to some randomer?

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:00.587
I promise I'm not a stalker.

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:03.090
I am trying to track her down
and she doesn't know about it

01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.300
but once I've found her,
the stalking'll stop.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:08.345
- Piss off. Give us back our speaker.
- Can I just have her number?

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:10.097
- Give it back.
- Can I have her number?

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:12.641
Hang on, I've got an idea.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.477
- I'll give you her number...
- Thank you.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.437
- ..if you show us your dicks.
- What?

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:19.231
And arses.

01:04:19.398 --> 01:04:22.776
This is a hen party
and what the bride wants, the bride gets.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:26.780
If you want her number, then you two
need to do us a little striptease.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:28.240
Woo! Striptease.

01:04:28.407 --> 01:04:30.075
- Me?
- Yeah, you too, hot stuff.

01:04:30.242 --> 01:04:33.453
Do you really want to see me naked?
I mean, even I don't wanna see me naked.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:36.540
Listen, if you two don't get your cocks
out pronto, then it's no deal.

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:38.375
Can we have a minute?

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.398
OK, so how do you wanna do this?
Do one at a time or together?

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:45.007
Wait. I'm not doing this.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.342

dispose of a body.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.645
I'm not even asking you to do that.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:03.275

I was gonna leave a note.

I wanted to do this weekend.

You promised me we'd see him.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.041
Right now I could be hanging out with him,
discussing beats.

01:09:30.207 --> 01:09:32.335
Instead I'm stuck in here
and it's all your fault.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:35.046
- My fault?
- You're the reason we're in here.

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:39.259
You're the one who made us spend all day
chasing after some fantasy girl.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:42.720
- You're the one who made me get naked.
- I'm the one who should be complaining.

01:09:42.888 --> 01:09:46.683
I've had my nipple pierced, I've got a
fucking mental tattoo all over my arse

01:09:46.892 --> 01:09:50.520

you bang on about some bullshit DJ

said you're a bell-end.

And you don't
care about anyone else

I'm joking. I've been through
all of the appropriate channels

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.290
and they've let you off with a caution.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.418
Did they mistreat you, Shane?

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.214
OK. Let's get you boys home.

- No, but Shane talks about him a lot.

Not to me, obviously. To others.

01:12:09.576 --> 01:12:11.453
Yeah, well, I guess I kind of messed up.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.247

and now he doesn't get to meet his hero

01:12:14.456 --> 01:12:16.082

He's right, I am a dick.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.044

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:20.545
So what? That's not a big deal.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:23.214
- What?
- I mean, look at Gandhi.

01:12:23.423 --> 01:12:26.885
He was a real knob to his wife
and actually he was quite racist,

01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:30.680
but still a cool person
and my personal hero.

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:35.435
Or Lance Armstrong.
Yes, he was a cheat, he was a bully.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:39.731
But he's raised a lot of money for charity
and he's also got a great podcast.

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:42.942
So, yeah, you might have
made a few dick moves,

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:46.446

make you a bad person.

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.395
So you'd better hurry up
and make a train noise.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.564
- Choo-choo.
- Louder.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.315
- Choo-choo!
- Do the arms.

01:14:04.566 --> 01:14:06.568
Choo-choo-choo. Ch-ch-ch...

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:09.487
- Choo-choo!
- Shovel some coal.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.865
Uh-oh.
There's another train coming.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.745
Choo-choo, choo-choo...

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:21.332
Amy, we're in a bit of a rush,
so can we...?

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.419
For you, not him.
We're still not friends.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:26.629
OK, so this is what you do.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:30.884
You climb... over the fence.

01:14:31.217 --> 01:14:32.343
- Oh, that's it?
- Yeah.

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.929
Taff could bunk you over,
but he charges for it.

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.848
I'll look out for security.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.568
Come on, Nick!

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:50.904
Nick, what are you waiting for? Jump.

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:52.155
OK, I've just...

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:53.948
My nipple ring is caught.

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:56.159
If you lift me up, I can get it off.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:00.788
Agh.

01:15:08.296 --> 01:15:10.298
Right, I've nearly got it.

01:15:11.758 --> 01:15:13.343
Oh, shit, I think someone's coming.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.557
Oh, phew. It was nothing. My bad.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:22.018
Let's go.

01:15:22.227 --> 01:15:24.062
Hammerhead! Hammerhead!

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.023
Hammerhead! Hammerhead!

01:15:33.154 --> 01:15:34.447
- Shit.
- Oh, well.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.814
- I need to see the doctor, please.
- Sure you do, mate.

01:15:36.908 --> 01:15:38.284
Oh, can I just show you that?

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.953
Jesus Christ.

01:15:40.286 --> 01:15:42.705
- In you go.
- Thank you.

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:45.291
- The backstage entrance is up here.
- I'm in a lot of pain.

01:15:45.542 --> 01:15:47.669
- Do I look shocked?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.195
Lick, what the fuck are you doing?

01:15:49.379 --> 01:15:51.673
Mate, can we come in?
We had wristbands but lost them.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:53.758
- No wristbands, no entry.
- Please, Pirate.

01:15:53.925 --> 01:15:57.428
I wish there was something I could do.
I mean, there is, but I'm not gonna do it.

01:15:57.637 --> 01:15:59.597
Brother David!

01:15:59.764 --> 01:16:02.183
Oh, Shane!

01:16:02.392 --> 01:16:04.018
Amy.

01:16:05.645 --> 01:16:07.397
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:07.605 --> 01:16:09.732
- How do you know Hammerhead's manager?
- Oh...

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.609
W... T-The...

01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.319
- The... Ooh...
- Oh.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:14.612
- We... erm...
- Erm...

01:16:14.779 --> 01:16:15.989
Er...

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.074
Well, fuck... erm...

01:16:18.992 --> 01:16:21.077
- We...
- What did...

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.328
We...

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.207
- We all like soup.
- Yep.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:28.042
Exactly.

01:16:28.835 --> 01:16:31.462
- You guys coming in?
- We're trying. But this guy won't let us.

01:16:31.671 --> 01:16:33.631
What? Don't be silly. Come in.

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:35.842
These guys are with Hammerhead.

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.973
We've got a bar there.
They serve beer, everything.

01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.976
- Thanks, Brother David.
- Ooh.

01:16:45.143 --> 01:16:47.103
It's just David around here.

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:50.440
- Hammerhead hasn't been on yet, has he?
- Mmm, not yet, no.

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:52.191
His trailer's there. Wanna say hello?

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.694
- Nothing in the world I want more.
- Yes, please.

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:58.531
- I should probably go and clean this up.
- Oh, my God. What is that?

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:00.992
Oh, nothing.

01:17:01.159 --> 01:17:03.161
Just a massive hole
where my nipple used to be.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:04.829
Yeah, we should get you to a doctor.

01:17:04.996 --> 01:17:07.373
No, no, I'll go on my own.
You go and meet Hammerhead.

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.543
- Are you sure?
- Yes. He's your hero. You've gotta go.

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:13.087
- Thanks, Nick.
- Argh!

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.839
- Please.
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:17.091
OK, let's go. Hammerhead awaits.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:20.345
Soleil De Volt

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:36.861
Just me.

01:17:37.028 --> 01:17:38.738
David, what's going on?

01:17:38.905 --> 01:17:40.948
I was supposed to
start my set an hour ago.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.244
Er... yeah,
they're a little bit behind schedule.

01:17:43.409 --> 01:17:45.662
But the good news is
that you'll be on soon.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.164
Anyway, couple of fans
wanted to say hello.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:51.167
Hi. It's an absolute honour,
Mr Hammerhead.

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:53.211
- Hello. I love you.
- Cheers.

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:56.506
If we're not going on now, could you
get me some proper food? I'm starving.

01:17:56.756 --> 01:17:58.383
Yeah, I could sort something out.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.261
Now? Yeah.

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:06.224
Hey, if you're feeling peckish,
I've got just the thing.

01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:08.935
It's a Chaffney bar.
It'll fill you right up.

01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:10.269
Chaffney?

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:13.523
- What the fuck is Chaffney?
- It's delicious. You'll love it.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.775
Go on, then.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:20.613
- Mm.
- Not bad, eh?

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.491
This is actually pretty good.

01:18:23.658 --> 01:18:27.453
If only my Great-Grandmami Agnes
knew that one day a superstar DJ

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:28.996
would tuck into her Chaffney.

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:31.124
She wouldn't know
what a superstar DJ was.

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:33.751
She lived in a treehouse
and had tennis rackets for shoes.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:35.628
She was quite seriously mentally ill.

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:37.130
I've just gotta say...

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.048
I love everything you've ever done.

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:41.467
Is it true that you once
had a drop so powerful

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:43.845
that it killed someone on the dancefloor?

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.763
That was just a coincidence.

01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:49.809
Got me trending on Twitter, though.

01:18:51.853 --> 01:18:53.146
Oh, that's amazing.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:56.399
You know, I actually write music too.
D-Do you wanna hear some?

01:18:56.566 --> 01:18:58.651
I've got some tracks on my phone.

01:19:10.455 --> 01:19:13.166
♪ Loving, you give me nothing

01:19:13.332 --> 01:19:17.086
♪ Till I'm black and blue inside

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:21.549
♪ You keep me falling,
but I'm going all in

01:19:21.716 --> 01:19:24.927
♪ Cos I still want you tonight...

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:26.679
Holy shit.

01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:27.198
After everything!
I've just wasted all my fucking life!

01:20:27.365 --> 01:20:29.700
- ..if you go through someone's phone.
- Fucking Minions.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.244
How long's it been going on?

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.371
How long has it been fucking going on?

01:20:46.259 --> 01:20:47.885
Order!

01:20:49.554 --> 01:20:50.680
Order!

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:55.476
Hey.

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:57.019
Hi.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.522
I have been looking for you all day.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:03.025
- OK. Why?
- It's me, Nick.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.070
You hid in my tent.
We had sex in a car.

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.031
Last night.

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:10.658
Oh, my God!

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:13.077
Car Dude.

01:21:13.244 --> 01:21:15.454
- How have you been, man?
- OK, yeah.

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:17.373
Er... Mostly been looking for you.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.500
Last night was fun.

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:21.168
Fucking fun.

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:23.170
Oh, my God,
I can barely remember anything.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:26.257
- I was so fucked.
- Me too.

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:31.846
So, listen, do you wanna,
like, get a drink or...?

01:21:32.513 --> 01:21:33.806
Er... No, thanks.

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:35.932
What?

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:38.603
I don't wanna get a drink with you.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:41.564
Oh. OK, cool.

01:21:43.316 --> 01:21:44.692
Yeah, that's...

01:21:44.859 --> 01:21:46.235
That's fine.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:47.403
OK.

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:49.405
That's all from me.

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:51.908
Erm... See... See you. That's it.

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:53.618
See ya.

01:22:00.082 --> 01:22:02.501
So with this one, I was trying to
mess around with, like,

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.004
a crunchier baseline, you know?

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:07.423
I think maybe five songs
is probably enough for now.

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.008
Sure. Sure.

01:22:09.175 --> 01:22:10.760
- I'll play you the rest later.
- Yeah.

01:22:10.927 --> 01:22:12.762
Where the fuck is David?
I feel a bit weird.

01:22:12.929 --> 01:22:15.014
- You do look a bit clammy.
- Yeah.

01:22:15.181 --> 01:22:17.224
I don't feel good. I feel quite unusual.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:19.101
I need to get up, actually.

01:22:19.268 --> 01:22:20.853
Oh, my God.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:23.856
Yeah.

01:22:24.023 --> 01:22:25.358
Oh, yeah.

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:27.485
I feel weird.

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:33.282
Oh, God.

01:22:34.659 --> 01:22:38.079
Can I ask you a question?
There's no shellfish in this, is there?

01:22:38.245 --> 01:22:40.039
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, great.

01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:42.249
There is a lot of crabmeat
but no shellfish.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.752
I'm fucking allergic to shellfish.

01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:46.754
Oh, my God.

01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.341
I've gotta get this out of me.
I've gotta get this out of me! Oh!

01:22:50.508 --> 01:22:51.592
OK, Hammerhead?

01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.220
I'm so sorry.
My Chaffney's never hurt anyone before.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.474
What's all the noise? What's going on?

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:01.185
Hammerhead was hungry.
I gave him one of my Chaffney bars.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:02.895
Now he's having an allergic reaction.

01:23:03.062 --> 01:23:04.942
- Shit. Is he all right?
- I'm sure he'll be OK.

01:23:05.064 --> 01:23:06.565
- Is it bad?
- Oh, my God!

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:07.984
- Holy shit!
Fuck!

01:23:09.402 --> 01:23:10.820
- Let me see.
- No, no, no, no.

01:23:10.987 --> 01:23:13.197
No, no. Sit down. Sit down.

01:23:13.364 --> 01:23:14.865
Hammerhead, we're ready for you.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:17.576
- Oh, shit.
- It's fine. The mask will cover it.

01:23:19.787 --> 01:23:20.871
It won't go on.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:22.206
Mr Hammerhead?

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:24.250
Oh, Jesus, erm...

01:23:26.002 --> 01:23:27.378
- That's not good.
- EpiPen.

01:23:27.545 --> 01:23:28.629
- What?
- Get me an EpiPen.

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:30.047
- Excuse me?
- The EpiPen.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:32.133
- What's he saying?
- Pen? He wants a pen?

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:33.467
Hammerhead?

01:23:33.634 --> 01:23:35.511
There's something in the bag.

01:23:35.678 --> 01:23:37.680
- Allergy pen.
- Yes!

01:23:38.139 --> 01:23:39.449
- It's OK.
- Get him on the floor!

01:23:39.473 --> 01:23:41.392
- OK, OK.
- That's it.

01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:43.227
- Hold him down.
- Whoo.

01:23:43.394 --> 01:23:45.980
- I'm gonna pierce the breast plate.
- No, no, no, my thigh.

01:23:46.147 --> 01:23:48.232
Put it in my thigh.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.317
- One...
- No...

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:51.986
- No!
- Two...

01:23:54.822 --> 01:23:56.615
Three!

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.120
- Did it work?
- No.

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:02.788
Mr Hammerhead?

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.195
- What we gonna do?
- You go on.

01:24:04.248 --> 01:24:05.332
- What?
- Put on the mask

01:24:05.499 --> 01:24:06.709
and pretend to be Hammerhead.

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.253
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. You know all his tunes.

01:24:09.420 --> 01:24:10.921
- You OK?
- We have to do something.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.798
Look. Hammerhead wants you to do it.

01:24:12.965 --> 01:24:14.925
- No.
- I think he does.

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:16.135
He's a pro.

01:24:16.302 --> 01:24:18.679
He doesn't wanna let the crowd down.
He knows you can do it.

01:24:18.846 --> 01:24:21.849
I need to be sure.
Hammerhead, shall I go out there?

01:24:22.016 --> 01:24:23.184
Shall I pretend to be you?

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:24.852
No fucking way.

01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:27.563
Let's do this.

01:24:33.903 --> 01:24:36.405
Hey, Hammerhead!
It's an honour to finally meet you.

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:38.657
You all set?

01:24:39.366 --> 01:24:40.743
Oh, yeah, good to go.

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:42.578
Wait, Lick. You're coming?

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:44.556
Yeah, he said I could
watch from the wings.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.916
OK, whatever.
Right this way, sir.

01:24:49.835 --> 01:24:51.420
I can do this, right?

01:24:51.754 --> 01:24:52.797
I can do this, yeah.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:56.008
OK. Just gotta be Hammerhead.
Just gotta be Hammerhead. It's easy.

01:24:56.467 --> 01:25:00.387
Hammerhead! Hammerhead! Hammerhead!

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:01.889
Hammerhead!

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.184
Hammerhead, man, you know.

01:25:05.351 --> 01:25:07.061
Wahgwan, my G.

01:25:08.354 --> 01:25:10.523
Give me some love.
What's going on with you guys?

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:13.567
Something's wrong. You're moving
like an imposter fish right now.

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:16.320
You OK, Mr Hammerhead?

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:19.490
- Nick, Nick.
- He's lost his voice.

01:25:19.949 --> 01:25:22.069
- You know the thing.
- Also, he's got a tender wrist.

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:24.120
Too much of this.

01:25:27.915 --> 01:25:29.834
Scratching. I didn't mean wanking.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.795
You're moving kinky, blud.
I'm done. I'm gone.

01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:34.797
All right, the riser's down there.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:37.383
- Have a good show.
- OK. Thanks for the directions.

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:39.468
- Shit, shit.
- Shane, you've done it.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:43.055
I don't know. I've met Hammerhead.
That's all I wanted. This is scary.

01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:46.433
Fear is just your body telling you
not to do something dangerous.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.685
That doesn't make sense.

01:25:47.852 --> 01:25:50.271
You can do this. I believe in you.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:52.815
Positive mental attitude.
Positive mental attitude.

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:56.652
Right, let's go.

01:25:57.111 --> 01:26:00.030
Hammerhead! Hammerhead! Hammerhead!

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.788
- Gordy.
- Nick.

01:26:07.955 --> 01:26:09.290
- All right, mate?
- Yeah.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:11.708
- What are you doing in there?
- In here? No idea.

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:14.253
But I will tell you this.
No more ketamine for me.

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:15.671
- Right.
- No more.

01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.340
- Bad Gordy. Too much ketamine.
- OK.

01:26:18.799 --> 01:26:20.819
- Do you wanna come and watch Hammerhead?
- Erm... no.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:22.386
I'm gonna get a bit more kip in here.

01:26:22.845 --> 01:26:25.014
Don't tell anyone,
but Hammerhead is actually Shane.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:26.640
Cool.

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:28.726
- Have you got any ketamine?
- No.

01:26:28.893 --> 01:26:30.895
See you later, Gordy.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.980
Hammerhead!

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.667
Hi, guys.
Can you believe we're backstage?

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:57.630
Nick, you are toxic and triggering,
and if you take one step closer to Lucy,

01:26:57.796 --> 01:26:59.757
I swear to God,
I will strike you with a punch.

01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:01.550
Jesus, Rex, stop.

01:27:02.009 --> 01:27:03.409
I'm not going to have sex with you.

01:27:03.844 --> 01:27:06.013
- What?
- And wash your foreskin, Rex. It stinks.

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:07.640
Caitlin, can I have a quick word?

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:09.767
- What?
- I just wanted to say sorry.

01:27:10.226 --> 01:27:12.228
For graduation and for this weekend.

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:14.355
- And for everything, really.
- Oh.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:16.523
We split up and I'm OK with that.

01:27:16.982 --> 01:27:18.776
Yeah.
I mean, we can still be friends.

01:27:19.235 --> 01:27:20.945
Oh, God, let's not be friends!

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.281
- Ugh, friends?
- You're right. What's gonna happen?

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.118
We hang out and play FIFA
and I start crying because I miss you.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:30.657
- Being friends with an ex is the worst.
- The worst.

01:27:30.955 --> 01:27:34.541
Let's not do that. Let's have a nasty,
difficult, immature break-up.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.545
Yes. You are selfish and anal,
and we are not friends.

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.005
Not friends.

01:27:43.259 --> 01:27:44.802
I can do this. I can do this.

01:27:44.969 --> 01:27:47.346
It's fine. I can do this.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:56.522
I can do anything. I can do anything.

01:27:56.981 --> 01:27:58.274
I can do anything.

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.487
Oh, shit.

01:28:09.576 --> 01:28:10.786
Shit. The music.

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:12.871
Oh, erm...

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.921
<i>Look at his face.</i>

01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:23.590
What do I do? What do I do now?

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:25.843
I'll just twiddle some buttons.

01:28:30.848 --> 01:28:32.141
Yeah!

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.938
This is the best night of my life!

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.326
Do you like soup?

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:52.995
Oh, sorry it took so long.
You know those queues are...

01:28:53.162 --> 01:28:54.204
Ugh! What the fuck?

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:55.581
Ah! Great. You're back.

01:28:55.748 --> 01:28:57.333
Well, I'll just get out of your hair.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.351
- What the hell happened?
- Oh, nothing.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:01.503
A little mishap involving some crabmeat.

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:04.840
- Isn't that right, Mr Hammerhead?
- He can't go out there like this!

01:29:05.299 --> 01:29:07.468
Don't worry about that.
Shane's gone out there instead.

01:29:07.634 --> 01:29:09.887
What? Are you insane?

01:29:10.346 --> 01:29:12.765
Glasshouses, mate. You fucked a goat.

01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:31.325
I didn't know you knew Hammerhead.

01:29:31.784 --> 01:29:33.452
Er... Yeah.

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:40.709
He's a bit geeky.

01:29:41.168 --> 01:29:42.711
Er... Yeah.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.552
We've gotta pull the gig.

01:29:50.803 --> 01:29:51.845
Why? He's killing it.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:54.181
Yeah, well,
that's not the real Hammerhead.

01:29:54.348 --> 01:29:56.725
- What?
- That is not the real Hammerhead.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.185
That is.

01:29:58.352 --> 01:29:59.770
I think it's going down.

01:29:59.937 --> 01:30:02.773
Holy shit. Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix this.

01:30:07.111 --> 01:30:08.320
- Hey.
- Oh, shit.

01:30:08.487 --> 01:30:10.322
Hey, get off the stage, arsehole.
Fun's over.

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:13.283
- I'm Hammerhead.
- You're not Hammerhead. Let's go.

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:15.619
- I'm Hammerhead.
- You're not Hammerhead.

01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.935
- You're not Hammerhead.
- I'm Hammerhead!

01:30:21.959 --> 01:30:23.293
Stop! Look, this is my moment!

01:30:24.711 --> 01:30:27.381
Holy shit. It's Dougie!

01:30:27.548 --> 01:30:29.466

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:42.271
Hammerhead can't DJ,
cos he ate a horsemeat and crab bar,

01:30:42.438 --> 01:30:44.481
but Shane can and it's his dream.

- Nick, what do I do?

01:30:56.452 --> 01:30:58.537
- I'm a bit busy.
- I can't hear you. What?

01:30:58.704 --> 01:31:00.497
- Just a bit busy.
- I can't hear you.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:01.874
- Play your stuff.
- What?

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.768

Shane, we've gotta go.

01:32:56.029 --> 01:32:58.865
- Oh, shit. What we gonna do?
- We could make a run for it.

01:32:59.032 --> 01:33:01.076
- I'm happy to run.
- In that case, we should run.

01:33:01.243 --> 01:33:02.619

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:03.954
That way?

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:07.833

No, no caution this time.

01:33:40.741 --> 01:33:42.451
Well, cos he hit me first.

01:33:42.618 --> 01:33:45.454
No, he didn't take my leg,
but only cos he couldn't.
