Gordon shaw,age 41,actor.

00:05.150 --> 00:08.720
Found dead by the maid at 2am in the pool house.

00:09.150 --> 00:10.820
Cause of death ?

00:19.500 --> 00:21.010
What do you mean it doesn't say ?

00:21.010 --> 00:23.680
Look at the size of that driveway,my word.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.540
What did he die of ?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.030
Doesn't say.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.150
That's supposed to be the most thorough book available.
Let me see that.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.240
Fritz,how did gordon shaw die ?

00:35.240 --> 00:37.840
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.280
What in the world is that ?

00:41.400 --> 00:42.740
Doesn't say.

00:46.450 --> 00:48.750
Here we go with the phone.

00:48.750 --> 00:52.360
Brenda leigh,I thought you said you
were taking the day off.

00:52.360 --> 00:54.020
I did.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.770
Hi,sergeant gabriel.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.120
Yes.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.990
I can't believe i left my mother
alone with fritz for the whole day.

01:35.990 --> 01:39.190
- She'll be fine.
- I'm not worried about my mother.

01:39.190 --> 01:41.520
Hold on to your hat,chief.

01:41.520 --> 01:43.230
We got a gang related shooting.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.420
- In this neighborhood ?
- No.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.110
And,uh,your buddy's here again.

01:48.110 --> 01:50.460
I'm used to commander taylor 
showing up at our crime scenes.

01:50.460 --> 01:52.880
What are we doing showing up at one of his ?

01:52.880 --> 01:55.150
3 victims.
Automatically a priority.

01:55.150 --> 01:59.910
2 dead,1 over at county,and by the way,
taylor knows one of the victims.

02:00.570 --> 02:02.760
Ok. Who wants to catch me up ?

02:03.170 --> 02:04.760
I ran the plates.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.330
The suv is registered to a ronald talmadge.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.800
44 of ladera heights.

02:09.800 --> 02:13.670
Paramedics say it's from
the ids they got off the occupants.

02:13.670 --> 02:17.190
Driver was wesley talmadge.
Black,19.

02:17.190 --> 02:21.840
Probably the owner's son.
Passenger in the front,myra singleton.

02:21.840 --> 02:25.670
Also black,also 19.
Driver's license says she's from san diego.

02:25.670 --> 02:26.980
And our survivor ?

02:26.980 --> 02:30.440
Theresa hoover.White. 20.
She's in surgery right now.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.110
So who reported this ?

02:32.110 --> 02:36.320
Some old lady.Couple of blocks away.
Called in as shots fired.

02:36.710 --> 02:39.270
Casings are from
a tech-9.

02:39.790 --> 02:43.610
My guess,they started
shooting from about here.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.690
Then they drove off,
or ran.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.420
Deputy chief johnson.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.800
Nice of you to cut
your vacation short.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.910
It was only
a day off,commander.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.020
I understand
you knew the victim.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.560
Go ahead.

03:11.670 --> 03:13.210
I know his father.

03:13.210 --> 03:16.640
Only met wesley
a couple of times.Good kid.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.210
Sorry,commander.

03:19.660 --> 03:23.450
I know what this looks like,chief.
This kid's no gangster.

03:23.450 --> 03:29.190
So I take it as a personal favor if you give this
case all the energy you give to your high profile victims.

03:29.190 --> 03:32.810
I give all my energy to all my cases.
That's my job.

03:32.810 --> 03:35.410
No need to consider it
a favor.

03:35.410 --> 03:36.980
Fine.

03:37.290 --> 03:40.180
I know his parents
will appreciate it.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.330
- Any weapons in the car ?
- Nothing visible.

03:44.530 --> 03:48.120
We're waiting for S.I.D. To give it the once over,
then we'll bring it down to the lab.

03:48.610 --> 03:50.140
Ok.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.870
It's all yours.
Thank you.

04:04.780 --> 04:08.810
So what is a good kid like wesley
doing in a place like this ?

04:08.810 --> 04:12.680
He was in a gang neighborhood driving a car
with "shoot me" written all over it.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.660
Figueroa leads right into the university.
The kid's from ladera up the hill.

04:15.660 --> 04:19.620
He's got to go through this neighborhood to get to school.
Maybe he just got caught up in a random drive by.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.820
I'm not a big fan of random.
Got shot in the head.

04:22.820 --> 04:26.820
Probably never saw it coming.
Anybody see anything ?

04:26.820 --> 04:30.110
Everyone saw everything
and no one saw nothing.

04:30.110 --> 04:33.260
This is 5-3 territory
48th up to gage.

04:33.260 --> 04:35.830
5-3 and 6-deuce
are in a gang war.

04:35.830 --> 04:38.990
And this whole thing looks like
a standard issue gang hit.

04:38.990 --> 04:43.740
Please get in touch with gang intelligence
and have them round up the most active 6-deuces.

04:43.740 --> 04:47.070
And then pull all the reports
of gang shootings over the past couple of weeks.

04:47.070 --> 04:51.920
Lieutenant tao,please finish processing the scene.
Find out what we can about the weapons involved.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.510
Lieutenant flynn,I'd like you
to head on over to county.

04:54.510 --> 04:58.190
I want someone there
when theresa hoover gets out of surgery.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.570
And lieutenant provenza,
if you could get in touch with

05:02.570 --> 05:06.810
san diego county sheriff's department
for the notification of myra singleton's parents.

05:06.810 --> 05:11.000
We'll handle the talmadges.
Thank you,everyone.Thank you very much.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.270
Man,this notification has got to be
one of the hardest parts of your job,huh ?

05:15.270 --> 05:18.540
It is. But I'm not doing my job today.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.540
You are.

05:24.810 --> 05:26.420
We need them to talk to us.

05:26.420 --> 05:29.720
So don't say you're from homicide.
Just say lapd.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.110
When people see you at their door,
and you say homicide,you lose them.

05:33.110 --> 05:35.920
And any chance of learning something useful.

05:37.650 --> 05:41.400
Hello,mrs. Talmadge.I'm detective gabriel.Lapd.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.640
Detective johnson.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.660
Ask if anyone else is there.

05:46.660 --> 05:49.560
Just in case they pass out
when they hear the news.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.400
I had a single mother
once who fainted.

05:51.400 --> 05:56.240
Slammed her head on the coffee table, and I was stuck 
waiting for an ambulance with a bleeding,unconscious woman.

05:57.450 --> 06:00.330
Is,uh,is there anyone
else at home,ma'am ?

06:00.330 --> 06:04.350
My husband is in the kitchen.
Why,is there something wrong ?

06:04.950 --> 06:06.940
What's going on ?

06:08.110 --> 06:10.170
Is there something wrong ?

06:11.130 --> 06:12.220
Is it wesley ?

06:12.220 --> 06:15.070
Answer any question they have with
another question.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.560
You need to find out
if they saw their son.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.500
Might even tell us something about
their relationship with him.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.110
Maybe even who he hangs out with.

06:23.110 --> 06:26.350
Sir,have you seen
or talked to your son today ?

06:27.960 --> 06:31.760
I haven't seen him.He came by earlier to
borrow the car,but we were out,why ?

06:31.760 --> 06:34.090
- What's going on ?
- What is this ?

06:34.090 --> 06:36.190
Is he ok ?

06:36.190 --> 06:39.980
Please,tell me that wesley is ok.

06:41.810 --> 06:44.360
How you say it is up to you.

06:44.960 --> 06:49.720
There was a shooting this afternoon
off of figueroa,

06:49.720 --> 06:52.610
and your son wesley was involved,

06:53.060 --> 06:56.410
and I'm very sorry to say
that he did not make it.

06:56.860 --> 07:01.200
Once you tell them,
watch closely how they react.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.180
What's the first thing
they think of.

07:03.180 --> 07:06.090
You're lying.
No,you are lying!

07:06.920 --> 07:08.600
- No.
- This is all your fault!

07:09.460 --> 07:11.620
I told you
this would happen!

07:11.620 --> 07:12.120
Honey,take it easy.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.830
Get away from me!
It's all your fault!

07:15.380 --> 07:17.180
Now,get ready.

07:17.180 --> 07:22.200
You're about to become the main character
in the story of someone's worst day ever.

07:25.020 --> 07:27.750
It's your fault!

07:27.750 --> 07:30.060
It's your fault!

07:41.290 --> 07:42.970
I ain't heard nothing
about no shooting.

07:42.970 --> 07:45.400
You ain't heard about
a black escalade

07:45.590 --> 07:49.420
taking 40 rounds 10 blocks
from your building ?

07:49.640 --> 07:52.150
Nothing.It wasn't us,man.
We didn't do it.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.900
And we ain't about to lose
no sleep over it either.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.410
Ain't no shame in poppin'
no 5-trey.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.740
My ass hurts
sittin' down here.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.560
Hey,you my johnny
or what ?

08:07.740 --> 08:09.370
Hey,where you going ?

08:09.370 --> 08:12.120
Do you know
how to count ?

08:12.510 --> 08:15.050
What's with the outstanding citizen
convention in the hall ?

08:15.050 --> 08:18.300
I had the gang squad haul in
the most active 6-deuces.

08:18.300 --> 08:22.570
We think this might have been some kind of
tit for tat in their war with the 5-3s.

08:22.570 --> 08:26.120
Is that the official legal term
for revenge killing now,"tit for tat ?"

08:26.640 --> 08:30.190
Trying to find out the connection
between wesley talmadge and the 5-3s.

08:30.990 --> 08:32.860
Commander taylor told me
there is no connection.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.360
Well,tell him to leave the evidence
proving that on my desk.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.830
Take off your shoe.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.380
Oh,I love when he does this.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.610
You ain't got nothing on me.
I don't even have to tell you nothin'.

08:42.610 --> 08:45.260
Take off your shoe.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.230
You kicked me.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.740
You have the right to--

09:08.740 --> 09:10.680
wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,man,wait.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.450
Ok,ok.Ok.

09:15.310 --> 09:18.120
It's good to see you're having
a positive effect on your people.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.790
Is this talmadge boy a 5-3 ?

09:28.910 --> 09:30.390
I don't know,man.

09:30.390 --> 09:30.970
Wait,wait,wait,wait.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.850
Is this talmadge kid a 5-3 ?

09:34.270 --> 09:36.150
Look,man.I don't have nothing
'cause it ain't nothing to give.

09:36.150 --> 09:40.370
People brag aboutthis kind of thing.
Especially 187 on a 5-trey.

09:40.370 --> 09:42.880
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin'.

09:48.230 --> 09:50.540
I'll make it up to you,fritz,I swear.

09:50.890 --> 09:54.120
No. No,no.
I'll probably be late.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.310
I'm sorry.
Bye.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.750
Ok,what do we know about the boy ?

09:58.750 --> 10:02.120
Teachers liked him.
Played high school soccer.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.960
He got into usc
on grades and his sats.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.360
Never been arrested.
Never had a traffic ticket.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.390
- Kid was clean as a safeway chicken.
- What about the murder weapon ?

10:11.390 --> 10:14.210
Slugs and casings all came from
the same gun.Tech-9.

10:14.210 --> 10:16.140
What about wesley,
any weapons ?

10:16.140 --> 10:18.390
No weapons in the vehicle
or on his person.

10:18.390 --> 10:21.770
Also,nothing registered
to wesley or his parents.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.320
What about the parents ?

10:26.060 --> 10:29.930
Well,it's just that when we did the notification,
mrs. Talmadge seemed to put the blame on the father.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.880
She kept saying,"this is your fault.
This is your fault."

10:32.880 --> 10:35.260
Maybe someone thought they were shooting
at the father.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.080
Or the girlfriend.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.450
It's not just the boys
get caught up in these wars.

10:39.450 --> 10:44.180
I don't know.This is a good kid.
Lots of friends.Deans list at usc.

10:44.180 --> 10:48.380
Myra singleton's the type of girl
a guy takes home to meet his mother.

10:48.380 --> 10:52.400
Only one little problem.Myra singleton
wasn't the girlfriend.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.320
Theresa hoover was.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.660
Theresa's still sedated,
but her roommate was there.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.820
Wesley and theresa have been dating
for 5 months.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.760
Everyone thinking what I'm thinking ?

11:16.190 --> 11:18.290
XXXXXXXXXXXx

11:20.610 --> 11:23.310
Thank you for coming.
Have a seat.

11:23.460 --> 11:25.850
We're tired.We haven't slept.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.930
We've got a funeral to plan.
Family in the house.

11:28.930 --> 11:31.290
Do you have news about
who killed our son ?

11:31.590 --> 11:33.480
Nothing I can share just yet.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.740
But it would be very helpful
if you could just clarify a few things.

11:38.860 --> 11:43.190
Um,lynn,the other day,
you said that this was ronald's fault.

11:44.990 --> 11:46.980
What did you mean by that ?

11:48.150 --> 11:50.330
I didn't know what I was saying.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.940
I don't remember
anything after...

11:56.160 --> 11:58.810
after he told me that...

11:59.920 --> 12:03.020
my baby...
was dead.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.690
Lynn wanted wesley to go
to a small college away from L.A.

12:10.690 --> 12:13.910
She wanted to protect him
from all the gangs and drugs.

12:13.910 --> 12:17.440
I encouraged him to go to usc.
It's where I went to school.

12:20.220 --> 12:23.360
Does wesley know anyone
who was involved with gangs ?

12:23.360 --> 12:25.020
Absolutely not.

12:25.020 --> 12:27.260
Not all young black men
turn into gangsters.

12:27.260 --> 12:31.400
We brought wesley up to stay away from
those kind of people,and he always has.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.290
I'm not trying to make him into
something he's not.

12:34.290 --> 12:36.230
I'm trying to find
who took your son from you.

12:36.230 --> 12:40.700
And that's gonna require me finding out
everything I can about your family.

12:42.910 --> 12:45.260
You two had,uh,

12:45.260 --> 12:47.870
two vehicles registered in your name.

12:47.870 --> 12:52.170
The escalade and the acura sedan.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.390
Which one did you usually drive ?

12:54.390 --> 12:57.080
The acura's lynn's,
I drive the escal--

12:58.060 --> 13:01.900
wait a minute,you--
you think they were trying to kill me ?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.560
We have to look at all
the possibilities.

13:04.560 --> 13:08.350
Your company did a lot of good
in some very bad neighborhoods.

13:08.350 --> 13:13.070
A lot of gangs have a vested interest
in things staying bad.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.330
How often did wesley
use your car ?

13:20.330 --> 13:22.450
Well,he has--

13:23.340 --> 13:25.660
he had his own.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.340
A camry.But it's,it's getting old.

13:28.340 --> 13:31.670
So he would borrow
our escalade sometimes on the weekend

13:31.670 --> 13:34.610
or to take
his girlfriend out.

13:34.610 --> 13:37.180
How well did you know
wesley's girlfriend ?

13:37.180 --> 13:41.020
You know boys.Always embarrassed
by their parents.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.310
So you never met theresa.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.390
Theresa ?
Theresa hoover.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.490
Wesley's girlfriend.

13:51.240 --> 13:54.030
Theresa and wesley
were just friends from english class.

13:54.030 --> 13:56.680
- Who told you they were dating ?
- Her roommate.

13:58.790 --> 14:02.930
Would wesley have any reason to think
that you two wouldn't approve ?

14:06.670 --> 14:08.690
To be honest ?

14:09.340 --> 14:12.550
If I knew wesley was in
an interracial relationship,

14:13.000 --> 14:16.290
I'd be more worried
for him than happy.

14:16.290 --> 14:20.310
I mean,there are a lot of people out there
who still can't see past black and white.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.640
Is that what you think
might have happened here ?

14:24.740 --> 14:27.130
I don't know yet.

14:28.030 --> 14:31.430
But I have to wonder
if he kept this a secret,

14:32.240 --> 14:35.420
what else was he
keeping from you ?

14:42.390 --> 14:46.210
All right.
We'll be there in about 20 minutes.Great.

14:46.590 --> 14:49.980
Theresa hoover is awake,and the doctor
said she's getting her strength back.

14:49.980 --> 14:53.910
Good. Listen,I'd really appreciate it
if you didn't mention anything about fritz.

14:53.910 --> 14:55.130
You didn't tell your mom about fritz ?

14:55.130 --> 14:58.410
Of course I told my mom about fritz.
Just not some of the details.

14:58.410 --> 15:01.820
And I don't have time to tell you which one,
so let's just leave them all out,ok ?

15:01.820 --> 15:04.280
Ok,is there anything else
i should avoid ?

15:04.280 --> 15:06.850
Politics,religion.

15:07.730 --> 15:10.940
The atlanta braves.
Vegetarianism.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.970
- Just smile and wave,ok ?
- Ok.

15:13.970 --> 15:16.140
Hey,mama.

15:16.590 --> 15:17.940
Hey.

15:17.940 --> 15:20.240
Oh,mama. What have you
been doing in here ?

15:20.240 --> 15:23.690
Cleaning.I haven't had the courage
to tackle the bedroom yet.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.440
You didn't need to do all this.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.560
Well,somebody did.
And you've been working all day.

15:28.860 --> 15:32.230
Besides,a person can't walk
anywhere in this city.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.130
That's why I rented you a car.

15:34.130 --> 15:38.870
Well,I don't trust l.A. Drivers. Everybody's
always talking on their portable telephones.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.970
Any mail ?

15:42.530 --> 15:44.140
Oh.

15:46.730 --> 15:50.180
We didn't meet individually
at the police station.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.030
I'm willie ray johnson.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.930
Brenda's mother,
and you are ?

15:53.930 --> 15:57.120
Sergeant,uh...
david gabriel.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.210
Nice to meet you.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.060
Mama,have you seen
my glasses ?

16:04.060 --> 16:06.390
No,dear. Sorry.
Try your room.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.200
Ok.

16:11.490 --> 16:13.020
So...

16:13.020 --> 16:14.970
- david gabriel.
- Yes,ma'am.

16:14.970 --> 16:19.120
I spent a lovely day yesterday
with brenda's friend fritz.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.360
Do you know him ?

16:28.670 --> 16:29.570
Hey.

16:29.570 --> 16:33.950
So I checked into your murder with some of
my guys,they know the 5-3,6-deuces pretty well.

16:34.550 --> 16:38.680
Consensus is this was a clear case
of retribution in their war.

16:38.680 --> 16:43.430
Well,so far,I can't find any evidence
that wesley talmadge was even in a gang.

16:44.170 --> 16:49.190
Brenda,I knowb taylor wants to believe
that talmadge was an altar boy,

16:49.190 --> 16:52.850
but everything about this shooting
points to a not very original conclusion.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.960
The kid was a weekend gangster,
he got shot for it.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.970
You're right.

16:57.970 --> 17:00.290
That's not very original.

17:00.290 --> 17:02.660
By the way,have you seen my glasses ?

17:02.660 --> 17:05.380
Maybe you left them at my house.
Oh,no,wait.

17:05.380 --> 17:08.440
I don't have a house.
I live out of a u-haul.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.770
Honestly,mrs. Johnson,

17:12.770 --> 17:15.829
your daughter and i don't discuss too much
personal stuff.

17:15.829 --> 17:18.890
- But surely you've met him.
- I don't think so. No.

17:18.890 --> 17:21.819
- You've never met him ?
- No.

17:21.819 --> 17:27.020
That's funnybecause fritz said that he's
worked a couple of cases with your squad.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.790
Oh,agent howard.

17:30.790 --> 17:33.120
Oh,his name is fritz ?
That's a great name,fritz.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.320
Mama,I can't find
my glasses anywhere.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.310
Oh...
here. Borrow mine.

17:38.310 --> 17:40.000
Oh,thank you.

17:41.550 --> 17:44.160
There's nothing to read
in this house anyway.

17:48.010 --> 17:49.570
Ok...

17:53.480 --> 17:57.110
we,um,we met
in an english seminar.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.240
Modern poetry.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.920
He came up to me
after the first class.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.630
He was really funny,
and,uh...

18:05.630 --> 18:09.320
he asked me to go to dinner
and to see a movie.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.930
He was really into movies.

18:11.930 --> 18:15.650
Dinner and a movie.Is that where
the two of you were headed ?

18:18.160 --> 18:19.490
No.

18:20.220 --> 18:23.610
I read about
this new club downtown.

18:24.260 --> 18:27.360
Wesley liked to take
his dad's car to that kind of thing.

18:27.670 --> 18:31.600
So we went over to his parents house
in the afternoon to pick it up.

18:33.770 --> 18:36.610
What was myra singleton
doing with you ?

18:37.940 --> 18:39.340
Yeah.

18:39.940 --> 18:44.420
Well,we were just kind of
in the habit of bringing along a third.

18:45.060 --> 18:47.850
Especially in certain
neighborhoods.

18:48.970 --> 18:50.940
Because ?

18:52.060 --> 18:57.240
Because people aren't exactly
supportive of interracial relationships.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.490
You two ever had trouble
because of that before ?

19:00.490 --> 19:02.510
Sometimes.

19:02.510 --> 19:06.630
The way people looked at us.
The things they would say.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.080
Is that why you didn't
tell wesley's parents about the two of you ?

19:11.790 --> 19:13.390
I wanted to.

19:13.390 --> 19:18.290
I mean,I met them,and I liked them,
but he was worried.You know,he thought

19:18.290 --> 19:21.310
they might not react that well.

19:23.260 --> 19:27.950
Um,did wesley or any of his friends
ever mention anything about gangs ?

19:28.890 --> 19:32.210
Wesley mostly stayed away
from people that were into that.

19:35.830 --> 19:39.940
Can you remember any details
about the shooting ?

19:48.290 --> 19:52.280
We were just driving along

19:52.280 --> 19:55.680
and I heard this guy
yelling from the next car.

19:56.450 --> 19:58.500
He was swearing,

19:58.870 --> 20:03.010
and,uh,wesley slowed down
to try to let him pass,

20:03.010 --> 20:05.110
and then,

20:06.040 --> 20:10.040
I heard him scream,
this is from everyone.

20:11.920 --> 20:15.230
And then,I don't know,
I guess he just started shooting.

20:15.850 --> 20:18.090
It was so loud,and...

20:18.530 --> 20:21.110
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.610
Oh,sweetie.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.010
The guy yelled,
"this is from everyone."

20:40.010 --> 20:43.360
I mean,you think this whole thing
is some sort of racist political statement ?

20:43.360 --> 20:46.500
The official legal term
is "hate crime."

20:46.500 --> 20:49.370
- What if she heard him wrong ?
- What do you mean ?

20:49.370 --> 20:52.220
Maybe he didn't yell,
"from everyone."

20:52.220 --> 20:58.130
There's over 200 gangs in L. A.
There's 35 in this area alone.

20:59.340 --> 21:03.370
What if he yelled,from 4-1,
or from 8-1.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.590
You see,a gangster will yell out his
territory before he pulls the trigger,

21:07.590 --> 21:09.740
so that you know who's

21:09.740 --> 21:14.460
sending bullets your way.If we're looking at
a feud between the 6-deuces and the 5-treys,

21:14.820 --> 21:18.550
well,what if the shooter
was from a different gang ?

21:19.370 --> 21:23.170
Any recent incidents
in these other gang territories ?

21:24.190 --> 21:29.960
Two weeks ago,we got a shots fired report on
two kids,14 years old,a couple of 8-1s.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.600
Someone shot at them
from a moving black suv.

21:36.170 --> 21:39.420
Lieutenant tao,would you please get me
a full incident report

21:39.420 --> 21:43.670
of that shooting and anything else
about the 8-1s and then,

21:43.670 --> 21:46.690
I'd like to take a look around that
neighborhood and see if anyone will talk to me.

21:46.690 --> 21:49.150
6-deuces,8-1s,eleventy-4s.

21:49.150 --> 21:51.700
How can they keep straight
who's shooting at who ?

21:51.700 --> 21:54.120
Well,lieutenant provenza,

21:54.700 --> 21:56.890
maybe they can'T.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.560
30pm on the 10th,

22:05.560 --> 22:08.470
two 14-year-old boys
were leaving this apartment here

22:09.210 --> 22:13.510
when a black suv screeches around
this corner and opens fire.

22:14.030 --> 22:14.910
One kid got lucky,

22:14.910 --> 22:16.380
the other one,not so much.

22:16.380 --> 22:17.860
He's paralyzed from the waist down.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.430
Witnesses reported between 10 and 15
rounds were fired.

22:21.430 --> 22:23.390
What else did the witnesses report ?

22:23.390 --> 22:25.420
One guy swore the suv was dark blue,

22:25.420 --> 22:26.890
but everybody else said black.

22:26.890 --> 22:29.330
There was a girl who was pretty
sure it was a navigator.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.770
One of the kid's cousins gave
chase for a few blocks,

22:31.960 --> 22:36.020
but gave up when he realized
his little cousin was on the ground.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.610
Hey. Don't touch that.

22:42.710 --> 22:44.400
The guy that gave chase,

22:44.500 --> 22:46.900
did the report list his given name or a nickname ?

22:46.900 --> 22:47.970
Given.

22:47.970 --> 22:50.710
Lawrence oakley.

22:50.710 --> 22:51.680
I got a feeling

22:51.680 --> 22:54.740
wesley's shooters are a couple of
gangsters named pookie and little devil.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.180
Why do you say that ?

22:56.180 --> 22:58.940
Cause they signed their
confession right here on the wall.

23:00.060 --> 23:02.560
187. That's murder.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.090
B,crossed out.

23:04.090 --> 23:05.270
That means dead bloods.

23:05.270 --> 23:06.630
5-3 with a slash through it.

23:06.630 --> 23:08.950
That indicates a specific territory.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.110
Usc,slash through it.

23:11.110 --> 23:12.210
That's our victim.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.340
Names above it,

23:13.340 --> 23:14.500
pookie and little devil,

23:14.500 --> 23:16.080
those are our shooters.

23:16.080 --> 23:22.840
They're telling the world how they got revenge
on the 5-3 for shooting at their 8-1 brothers.

23:31.260 --> 23:32.930
Pookie has a pretty long record.

23:32.930 --> 23:34.750
Selling drugs. Assault.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.460
A bunch of misdemeanors.

23:36.460 --> 23:39.090
But he's pretty high up in the 8-1 organization.

23:39.090 --> 23:41.440
Is this in focus ?

23:43.420 --> 23:46.940
Oh,buzz,bless you.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.930
Pookie tell us anything ?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.120
We got a better shot at little devil.

23:54.390 --> 23:56.450
He'd be afraid to let his brothers down.

23:56.450 --> 23:59.770
But he hasn't done any time yet.

24:00.980 --> 24:03.800
Anyone have a quarter ?

24:03.800 --> 24:05.550
Yeah,why ?

24:05.550 --> 24:08.220
Can I borrow it for a minute,please ?

24:08.220 --> 24:10.980
Thank you.

24:11.840 --> 24:15.760
Which one of you is lawrence ?

24:16.950 --> 24:20.260
Then,you must be michael.

24:20.260 --> 24:21.680
Ok,boys.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.750
Here's the situation.

24:23.750 --> 24:24.470
We know

24:24.470 --> 24:28.430
that the two of you murdered two people
and wounded a third two days ago.

24:28.430 --> 24:29.240
We know this

24:29.240 --> 24:34.460
because you basically signed your confession on the wall
of your cousin's apartment building in spray paint.

24:34.460 --> 24:37.640
Not smart,but probably not enough to get a conviction,

24:37.640 --> 24:42.320
so I need one of you to talk.

24:42.600 --> 24:44.490
One driver,one shooter,

24:44.490 --> 24:45.710
one deal.

24:45.710 --> 24:48.470
All you have to do is tell me you were driving.

24:56.520 --> 24:58.530
Ok. I understand.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.430
It could be a bit awkward.

25:00.430 --> 25:04.140
Selling out your friend to his face,so...

25:05.490 --> 25:08.160
call it in the air.

25:15.260 --> 25:16.930
Heads.

25:17.560 --> 25:18.830
It's tails.

25:18.830 --> 25:19.920
Detective sanchez,

25:19.920 --> 25:24.900
will you please escort lawrence here to interview room two.

25:24.900 --> 25:25.600
Thank you.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.770
Let's go.

25:35.670 --> 25:36.780
Well,michael.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.040
Looks like pookie's gonna get the first chance.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.930
You better hope he's stubborn.

25:40.930 --> 25:44.520
And stupid.

26:36.740 --> 26:38.910
We've been in here half an hour.

26:38.910 --> 26:41.440
Ain't you gonna ask me anything ?

26:41.690 --> 26:44.590
Well,you're not gonna tell me anything,

26:44.590 --> 26:46.840
are you,pookie ?

26:47.260 --> 26:48.450
No.

26:48.450 --> 26:51.270
Okey dokey.

26:52.650 --> 26:53.510
Well,michael,

26:53.510 --> 26:55.270
should've called tails.

26:55.270 --> 26:56.290
What did he say ?

26:56.290 --> 26:57.960
Oh,I can't tell you that.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.430
But it looks like i'll be getting off work a little early today.

27:00.430 --> 27:00.940
Come on,man.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.020
Don't I get a chance ?

27:02.020 --> 27:02.880
No,michael.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.230
I'm sorry. Because i know what you're going to say.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.500
You're gonna tell me the same story pookie told me.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.550
Only this time,

27:08.550 --> 27:10.200
you're gonna be the one who's behind the wheel.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.350
But that's what happened.

27:12.350 --> 27:14.000
What ? What happened ?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.320
I was driving.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.240
See,michael.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.360
This is exactly what I'm saying.

27:17.360 --> 27:18.140
But I was.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.770
You never fired a gun into that suv ?

27:20.770 --> 27:21.310
No.

27:21.310 --> 27:23.520
Then who did ?

27:30.520 --> 27:32.060
Pookie.

27:35.990 --> 27:38.480
I'll call the talmadges.

27:41.270 --> 27:47.880
And why did pookie fire 40 rounds
into wesley talmadge's escalade ?

27:48.420 --> 27:50.030
Payback.

27:50.030 --> 27:54.050
That's the same escalade that
opened up on pookie's cousin 2 weeks ago.

27:54.050 --> 27:56.400
The shooting on 81st street ?

27:56.400 --> 27:59.450
An eye witness reported a black navigator.

27:59.450 --> 28:01.350
Pookie shot the wrong car.

28:01.350 --> 28:03.960
No. It wasn't no wrong car.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.260
After them dudes shot his cousin,

28:05.260 --> 28:06.670
pookie chased after them.

28:06.670 --> 28:08.240
He knew what that escalade looked like.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.550
Do you know how many black escalades there are in L.A. ?

28:11.550 --> 28:12.920
I know cars.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.550
I'm saying it was that escalade.

28:14.550 --> 28:15.500
I know rims.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.620
And the sticker on the back.

28:16.620 --> 28:17.250
What sticker ?

28:17.250 --> 28:21.050
The usc sticker on the back window.

28:32.850 --> 28:35.250
I realize the odds are a little bit longer,

28:35.250 --> 28:36.550
but this is L.A.

28:36.550 --> 28:39.340
I mean,there could've been another
escalade with an 'sc sticker on it.

28:39.340 --> 28:39.860
Lieutenant tao,

28:39.860 --> 28:41.750
how thorough was the lab ?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.460
They were a little backed up down here.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.900
They haven't gotten to it yet.

28:44.900 --> 28:48.420
And I don't imagine it's gonna be a top
priority now that we found the shooter.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.500
Well,we may know that pookie shot wesley,

28:51.500 --> 28:54.780
but I'm still not convinced we know why.

28:58.630 --> 29:00.360
What are you looking for ?

29:00.360 --> 29:01.960
A casing.

29:01.960 --> 29:04.350
The tech-9 casing ejects sideways.

29:04.350 --> 29:06.620
A couple inches forward at most.

29:06.620 --> 29:09.770
Casings not gonna fly all the
way from the shooter's gun into here.

29:09.770 --> 29:13.260
I don't care about bullets fired at this car.

29:13.520 --> 29:19.820
I want to know about bullets fired... from this car.

29:20.180 --> 29:23.040
And what reason do we have to
believe you didn't plant this casing ?

29:23.040 --> 29:24.000
Excuse me ?

29:24.000 --> 29:25.330
Ron,that's not fair.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.590
You people do it all the time.

29:26.590 --> 29:27.680
You need to close your case.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.200
Blame it on the black kid.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.520
Come on.We're leaving.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.840
Hey,hey. Settle down,

29:31.840 --> 29:32.730
mr. Talmadge,ok ?

29:32.730 --> 29:34.220
I know this is hard news to hear

29:34.220 --> 29:37.090
but it's hard news to deliver,
too so maybe we could all just--

29:37.090 --> 29:37.840
our son was murdered,

29:37.840 --> 29:40.110
and you're saying this is hard for you ?

29:40.110 --> 29:41.370
Lynn,come on.

29:41.370 --> 29:42.350
Ron,listen.

29:42.350 --> 29:44.340
I'll make sure none of these details get out.

29:44.340 --> 29:45.740
None of this matters anyway.

29:45.740 --> 29:47.620
What matters is we got the punks who--

29:47.620 --> 29:49.420
wait,wait,wait.

29:50.370 --> 29:51.840
What night did you say

29:51.840 --> 29:53.340
the other shooting took place ?

29:53.340 --> 29:55.000
The 10th.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.240
Wesley couldn't have done this.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.750
We had the escalade that night.

30:01.060 --> 30:01.890
We did.

30:01.890 --> 30:04.070
I think we went out to dinner that night.

30:04.070 --> 30:07.500
Yeah. A restaurant called "shay."

30:07.500 --> 30:10.570
On the 10th at 8 o'clock.

30:10.570 --> 30:14.390
How could wesley have shot those kids
if we had the escalade on the other side of town ?

30:14.390 --> 30:15.570
Don't bother.

30:15.570 --> 30:16.540
They don't believe us.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.290
They think we're lying to protect our son.

30:18.290 --> 30:21.010
I think that you've been through a terrible experience.

30:21.010 --> 30:22.430
And it's our word against yours.

30:22.430 --> 30:26.430
It's your word against physical evidence.

30:26.430 --> 30:27.650
Come on. We're leaving.

30:27.650 --> 30:28.150
Wait.

30:28.150 --> 30:28.980
Come on!

30:38.320 --> 30:42.970
I will not have my son turned
into some gangster punk.

31:01.390 --> 31:06.440
i can't believe my daughter's
done with work in time for dinner.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.740
So is this place any good ?

31:09.000 --> 31:11.110
Supposed to be.

31:11.110 --> 31:14.200
Talmadges came here a couple weeks ago.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.850
Who are the talmadges ?

31:17.850 --> 31:20.130
Friends of a friend.

31:20.130 --> 31:25.450
Oh,it really is nice of you to
pull away from work for an evening.

31:32.490 --> 31:34.080
I'm just gonna check their story.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.190
I'll do it when I go to the bathroom.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.400
It won't get in the way of dinner.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.980
I promise.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.010
Thank you.

31:39.010 --> 31:40.690
Thank you so much.

31:40.690 --> 31:41.710
Thank you.

31:41.710 --> 31:44.360
Thank you so much.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.780
Now don't put that in there,

31:47.780 --> 31:49.250
you'll never find it again.

31:49.250 --> 31:51.210
Oh,for heaven's sake.

31:51.210 --> 31:58.050
"Liability is not assumed by management
"for loss or damage due to fire,theft,or any other cause."

31:58.050 --> 32:00.300
Mama,can't we just have a nice dinner ?

32:00.300 --> 32:06.420
Oh,I just don't understand why people in los
angeles don't want to park their own car.

32:14.120 --> 32:15.540
Excuse me.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.240
Excuse me,sir.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.440
I need to ask you a few questions.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.150
Were you working here 2 weeks ago ?

32:21.150 --> 32:23.410
No. I just started last tuesday.

32:23.410 --> 32:24.470
Oh.

32:41.590 --> 32:43.440
Cuffs!

32:47.920 --> 32:49.160
Get off me,man.

32:49.710 --> 32:51.910
Get off me,man.

32:58.830 --> 33:01.790
You gave us a run for our money,marcus

33:01.790 --> 33:04.190
at the restaurant.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.050
You ever been in a gang ?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.250
No,ma'am.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.950
That's pretty amazing.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.460
Growing up where you did.

33:13.460 --> 33:16.390
It's hard to steer clear of that life.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.000
Yeah.

33:19.310 --> 33:21.290
My dad,he couldn'T.

33:21.290 --> 33:24.490
Got shot. Died.

33:24.490 --> 33:25.810
My ma didn't want that for me.

33:25.810 --> 33:29.210
She wanted me to finish school
get a job. So that's what I did.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.920
Good for her.

33:32.530 --> 33:34.200
Good for you.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.620
She must be so proud of you.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.630
Yes,ma'am.

33:40.630 --> 33:42.880
You ever been arrested ?

33:45.460 --> 33:46.420
Yeah.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.260
A few years ago.Stupid stuff though.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.490
I mean,like breaking the windows.

33:49.490 --> 33:51.520
Shoplifting.I paid for everything.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.990
You ever stolen a car ?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.060
No,ma'am. Never.

33:56.060 --> 33:57.970
Because there was a shooting.

33:57.970 --> 34:03.290
A double homicide involving a stolen car and we have
reason to believe you had something to do with it.

34:03.790 --> 34:05.560
What are you talking about ?

34:05.560 --> 34:07.470
What shooting ?

34:09.159 --> 34:11.620
A couple of days ago.A few kids.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.030
Wesley talmadge and myra singleton.

34:14.030 --> 34:17.420
Shot dead.

34:18.469 --> 34:20.020
I never seen these people.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.280
I swear,I don't know who they are.

34:21.280 --> 34:24.960
Who they were,marcus.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.130
Why did you run from me at the restaurant ?

34:28.130 --> 34:28.949
Well,

34:29.449 --> 34:30.710
where I'm from,you see a badge,

34:30.710 --> 34:32.690
you don't stick around.

34:34.120 --> 34:36.290
You recognize these people ?

34:39.520 --> 34:40.380
No,ma'am.

34:40.380 --> 34:41.639
They didn't eat at your restaurant ?

34:41.639 --> 34:43.179
A couple weeks ago ?

34:43.179 --> 34:46.159
They were driving a black escalade.

34:46.830 --> 34:49.310
I don't know.

34:49.980 --> 34:52.570
A lot of people--

34:54.210 --> 34:56.530
a lot of people come down to the restaurant.Maybe they did.

34:56.530 --> 34:58.840
You know they did.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.680
You parked their car for them.

35:00.680 --> 35:03.610
Or rather,you didn'T.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.230
Not right away anyway.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.630
Now do you want to tell me what happened,

35:07.630 --> 35:10.210
or do you want me to tell you ?

35:12.400 --> 35:15.450
You took the keys from ronald talmadge
but instead of parking that car,

35:15.450 --> 35:18.610
you drove down to 81st
street looking to settle a score.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.910
You saw two 8-1s,and you shot at them.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.320
Paralyzing one of the boys from the waist down,

35:23.320 --> 35:23.870
and then,

35:23.870 --> 35:24.970
you drove back to the restaurant,

35:24.970 --> 35:27.130
and you parked that escalade.

35:27.130 --> 35:27.960
No,ma'am.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.230
You figured they'd never
know their car was missing.

35:30.230 --> 35:33.920
And the 8-1s couldn't identify
you since you were driving a stolen car.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.120
But something else happened,

35:35.120 --> 35:37.600
when you shot at those 8-1s.Marcus

35:37.600 --> 35:39.290
those bullets kept on going.

35:39.290 --> 35:42.340
They kept on going until
they killed wesley and myra.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.390
What do these kids have to do
with the others you showed me ?

35:44.390 --> 35:46.180
After you shot at those children,

35:46.180 --> 35:48.010
the 8-1s retaliated.

35:48.010 --> 35:50.620
Someone saw that escalade you were driving.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.200
An 8-1 named pookie.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.010
Pookie hunted for that escalade.

35:54.010 --> 35:54.960
And when he found it,

35:54.960 --> 35:58.370
he shot at it.40 times.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.450
Wesley talmadge was 19.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.910
He was driving his parents' car.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.700
He wasn't in a gang.

36:04.700 --> 36:06.330
And neither was myra.

36:06.330 --> 36:09.430
And now they're both dead.

36:10.160 --> 36:13.770
I was there when wesley's mother
found out that her son,

36:13.770 --> 36:16.800
who she loved more than anything,

36:17.290 --> 36:18.980
was dead.

36:19.140 --> 36:22.740
All because of what you did on the 10th,marcus.

36:22.740 --> 36:24.640
Those bullets kept on going.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.130
No,ma'am.

36:27.130 --> 36:29.040
No. I didn't do this thing.

36:29.040 --> 36:29.940
I did not.

36:29.940 --> 36:30.960
But you were there.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.530
You were driving the talmadge's car.

36:32.530 --> 36:35.640
People saw that escalade.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.030
Ma'am it was those kids.

36:40.030 --> 36:41.700
It was those 8-1 babies.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.730
They pushed me at the movies a couple weeks ago.

36:43.730 --> 36:45.130
They pushed you ?

36:45.130 --> 36:49.390
I didn't want to make nothing of it but my friend
was there,and he said they was dissin' me.

36:49.390 --> 36:51.290
What friend,marcus ?

36:51.970 --> 36:53.330
Marcus!

36:53.330 --> 36:57.140
First you lie to me about stealing a car and now you're
covering up for one of your gangster friends.

36:57.140 --> 36:59.300
How am I supposed to belive you're not in a gang ?

36:59.300 --> 37:01.540
How's your mother supposed to believe that ?

37:01.540 --> 37:04.560
Ma'am,you can say you ain't gonna be in
no gang but that don't make

37:04.560 --> 37:05.170
the gangs go away.

37:05.170 --> 37:06.460
You still got to walk to school.

37:06.460 --> 37:07.920
You still got to the store.

37:07.920 --> 37:09.330
What was i supposed to do ?

37:09.330 --> 37:11.390
So you stayed friendly with those gang members ?

37:11.390 --> 37:13.250
You got to!

37:13.250 --> 37:13.880
Marcus

37:13.880 --> 37:17.200
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.720
I think you're a good person.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.430
But if you don't tell me who did this...

37:22.430 --> 37:25.930
all the evidence points to you.

37:29.840 --> 37:34.260
I didn't...kill anybody.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.670
I didn't even know he was gonna do it.

37:38.670 --> 37:39.790
He stopped by where I work,

37:39.790 --> 37:41.930
and we was just hangin'out talkin'.

37:41.930 --> 37:46.760
And when I go to park that escalade
he hops in and tells me to drive.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.500
I should've said no,I know but he was ridin' me.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.280
Sayin' that me being weak makes him look weak,

37:51.280 --> 37:52.950
you know what I'm sayin' ?

37:52.950 --> 37:53.900
And he had a gun,

37:53.900 --> 37:55.340
and he was yellin'.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.880
Turn here,turn there.

37:56.880 --> 37:57.960
Next thing I know,

37:57.960 --> 38:00.450
we're on 81st street.

38:00.450 --> 38:02.140
He was only supposed to scare'em.

38:02.140 --> 38:06.630
But then he pulls out his piece and starts shooting.

38:07.300 --> 38:11.170
And I just drove us out of there fast as I could.

38:11.610 --> 38:13.060
I swear.

38:13.060 --> 38:14.200
That's the truth.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.860
I was only driving.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.930
I didn't kill nobody,

38:17.930 --> 38:19.880
and I ain't in no gang.

38:19.880 --> 38:29.290
Marcus,you drove a stolen car to take a gang member and his
semi-automatic weapon into rival territory to scare some kids ?

38:29.290 --> 38:32.210
Now if that ain't gang activity I don't know what is.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.530
If you're in this gang,ok.

38:34.530 --> 38:36.400
Maybe going to jail will get you some respect,

38:36.400 --> 38:37.340
but if you're not,

38:37.340 --> 38:39.560
don't ruin it by covering up for this guy.

38:39.560 --> 38:41.420
That's what gang members do for each other.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.920
Tell me his name!

38:48.130 --> 38:51.170
I'm gonna die for this.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.530
I'm gonna die now.

38:56.730 --> 39:00.830
I won't let them kill you.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.790
You can't stop it,ma'am.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.950
But I'll give you the name.

39:09.530 --> 39:13.220
'Cause of that other little boy and that other girl.

39:19.180 --> 39:24.810
His name is...big junior.

39:25.980 --> 39:29.600
What's big junior's real name,marcus ?

39:36.830 --> 39:38.780
Nate.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.460
Nate rollins.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.560
I'm sorry.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.210
I'm so sorry.

39:52.210 --> 39:55.090
I tried so hard to make it through.

39:55.190 --> 39:56.930
We have a name.

39:57.450 --> 39:59.650
I tried so hard.

40:02.590 --> 40:05.590
Tell my mom that.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.610
You can tell her yourself.

40:10.340 --> 40:12.350
Write it all down.

40:12.350 --> 40:13.330
If I understand,

40:13.330 --> 40:15.670
I know she will.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.290
He's all yours.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.470
Commander.

40:46.070 --> 40:47.510
We need to find this big junior guy.

40:47.510 --> 40:49.020
Nate rollins.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.400
We might not be able to get him for murder,

40:50.400 --> 40:52.820
but we can probably get him for attempted murder.

40:52.820 --> 40:54.220
Assault with a deadly weapon.

40:54.220 --> 40:56.290
Shooting in an inhabited building.

40:56.290 --> 40:58.510
A guy like this probably has a record.

40:58.510 --> 41:00.280
Maybe we can give him his third strike.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.180
We're already on it.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.790
And talk to the D.A.

41:02.790 --> 41:06.910
I want to make sure that marcus gets
protection in exchange for his testimony.

41:07.010 --> 41:09.490
That protection should begin tonight commander.

41:09.490 --> 41:11.620
Yes,ma'am.

41:22.950 --> 41:30.360
You know,a non-fatal gang-related shooting on 81st street
isn't usually considered the jurisdiction of priority homicide.

41:30.360 --> 41:33.870
Seems less like you're doing your job
and more like you're doing a favor.

41:33.870 --> 41:35.390
I'm not doing anyone any favors.

41:35.390 --> 41:37.370
Just...

41:38.760 --> 41:41.780
can I just say thank you ?

41:42.190 --> 41:43.650
For what ?

41:43.650 --> 41:46.410
Wesley's still dead.

41:47.590 --> 41:50.080
You saved his reputation.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.380
A lot good that does him now.

41:53.250 --> 41:55.590
Yeah. Maybe so.

41:56.510 --> 42:00.100
But that's all his parents have left.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.700
Mama,I'm so sorry about dinner and all.

42:19.700 --> 42:22.480
Oh,honey,it's fine.

42:22.480 --> 42:24.050
Besides,I'm getting up early.

42:24.050 --> 42:26.420
I'm flying out in the morning.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.370
What ?

42:28.370 --> 42:30.050
You moved your flight up. Why ?

42:30.050 --> 42:31.440
I thought you were staying longer.

42:31.440 --> 42:34.590
I promised to show you stars that aren't dead.

42:34.590 --> 42:36.150
Guests are like fish.

42:36.150 --> 42:37.250
After 3 days,

42:37.250 --> 42:39.240
you better throw them out.

42:39.610 --> 42:41.710
You've been here a week.

42:43.470 --> 42:44.630
Mrs. Johnson.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.570
Really. Stay.

42:46.570 --> 42:47.870
That's sweet.

42:47.870 --> 42:49.870
But I best get on home.

42:49.870 --> 42:53.020
Your daddy's probably run out of fresh underwear.

42:53.020 --> 42:59.680
Besides,this gives fritz a chance to move
his stuff in from that tacky u-haul.

43:02.750 --> 43:09.690
In fact,why don't you go out now and
get yourself a clean pair of pants.

43:11.770 --> 43:14.650
Thank you,willie ray.

43:14.650 --> 43:18.330
I think I will.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.630
How--how--

43:25.630 --> 43:28.090
half the medicine cabinet was empty.

43:28.090 --> 43:29.670
Half your closet.

43:29.670 --> 43:31.770
His mail was arriving here.

43:31.770 --> 43:35.880
I never could get a straight
answer as to where he lived.

43:35.880 --> 43:40.540
And that baseball pyramid on your table.

43:41.360 --> 43:45.810
Why did you think you had to
keep this a secret from me ?

43:46.300 --> 43:48.030
I didn't want to disappoint you.

43:48.030 --> 43:48.810
Brenda leigh,

43:48.810 --> 43:52.760
it's much too late for that.

44:07.270 --> 44:09.190
Are you gonna tell daddy about this ?

44:09.190 --> 44:13.270
Oh,lord no.
