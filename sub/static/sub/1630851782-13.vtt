WEBVTT

00:07.268 --> 00:09.183
[crowd yelling]

00:09.313 --> 00:11.315
Manny, what are you saying?

00:11.489 --> 00:13.535
You're telling me
you're from 2062?

00:13.665 --> 00:15.667
2064.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.540
I spent two years in what
you'd consider the future.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.672
I don't-- That's...

00:20.846 --> 00:22.326
What?I'm here

00:22.500 --> 00:25.068
because things in the future
are bad, Jha.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.244
It's 40 more years
of the rich getting richer

00:27.418 --> 00:29.029
by taking resources
from everybody else.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.856
I can't let us stay
on that course.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.902
Okay, so what? Somehow
you make the future better

00:33.076 --> 00:34.904
by killing Rev?

00:35.078 --> 00:36.906
Not to mention all those
people in danger here today.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.778
Yes. Because today
always happens.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.998
It happens in every version
of the timeline.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
Okay, so why don't you stop it?

00:43.869 --> 00:44.783
If it wasn't this,
it'd be something else.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.002
It has been something else,

00:46.133 --> 00:48.961
over and over again
throughout history.

00:49.136 --> 00:51.442
There is a rot in this country,

00:51.616 --> 00:53.792
people who believe in white
supremacy above everything else.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.578
The system
we have now

00:56.752 --> 00:58.449
is cruel to its core.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.321
The sooner we tear it down,
the sooner we can work

01:00.495 --> 01:01.626
towards a better system
in its place.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.237
We have to start now.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.456
So people now have to die?

01:07.023 --> 01:08.242
Manny, that can't be the way.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.461
It's the only way.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.291
[grunting]

01:18.556 --> 01:20.210
Welcome, Manny Campos.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.435
[door whooshes open]

01:30.612 --> 01:32.483
MANNY:
Um...

01:32.657 --> 01:34.094
When am I?

01:35.356 --> 01:36.531
The year 2062.

01:37.706 --> 01:39.925
Still Detroit?Yes.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.014
Although you might not
recognize it.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.408
Michigan has been declared
a climate haven,

01:44.582 --> 01:47.411
and the population has
exploded in the last decade.

01:47.585 --> 01:48.760
It's been difficult.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.808
It's all real.
[laughs]

01:52.982 --> 01:54.592
We had a feeling
you'd catch on quickly.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.507
I am Dr. Amber Campbell,

01:56.638 --> 01:58.640
lead scientist
at our foundation.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.511
What do you think of the place?

02:00.642 --> 02:03.079
We have all of this
because of you.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.820
I built this?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.039
No. Sadly, in every version

02:07.214 --> 02:09.564
of your future
that we observed, you died

02:09.738 --> 02:11.435
before you could
complete the project.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.567
But you did lay the groundwork.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.569
Um...

02:14.743 --> 02:17.572
My brother's waiting for me
in 2020.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.443
He'll be worried.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.184
We are of, course, sorry
to pull you out of your life,

02:21.358 --> 02:24.318
but we think you'll agree
it's worthwhile.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.277
But why this me? Why now?

02:27.451 --> 02:32.674
Because 2020 Manny is as full
of hope and promise as ever,

02:32.848 --> 02:36.547
of understanding the space
between spaces.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.767
[scoffs]

02:42.162 --> 02:45.077
And who are you?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.645
I head a team of scientists
dedicated to using

02:47.819 --> 02:49.778
this technology in order
to better position

02:49.908 --> 02:51.562
key people in time

02:51.693 --> 02:54.913
in order to improve the
welfare of humanity today.

02:55.087 --> 02:58.221
But we need your help
honing our vision.

02:58.352 --> 03:02.660
The tech has a number
of limitations,

03:02.834 --> 03:04.836
and our experiments
are falling short.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.925
So far, they are not providing
the positive impact

03:07.099 --> 03:09.885
the world desperately needs.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.017
We believe you're the key
to our success.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.977
Humanity needs you.

03:15.151 --> 03:17.980
Will you help us
change the world?

03:18.981 --> 03:21.070
[laughs]

03:21.244 --> 03:22.419
[exhales]

03:22.593 --> 03:24.856
I told you what I was
working on, Jha.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.337
Breaking the fabric of time.

03:27.511 --> 03:29.121
The people I was with,
they thought they could

03:29.296 --> 03:31.689
make it work in other ways,

03:31.863 --> 03:34.388
tried to make incremental,
agreeable change

03:34.518 --> 03:36.694
that they could
feel good about.

03:36.868 --> 03:39.219
It doesn't work.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.092
[laughs softly]

03:43.266 --> 03:44.789
It never works.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.357
[clamoring]

03:47.531 --> 03:49.316
SHANICE:
Come on, we need
everyone's help.

03:49.490 --> 03:52.188
Get those chairs over here,
stack them up.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.193
[people yelling, screaming]

04:02.198 --> 04:04.244
I don't know how much longer
those ropes are gonna hold.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.469
We're ready!
If they want a fight,

04:12.643 --> 04:14.254
we'll give them a fight.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.562
FARRADAY:
Right this way, sir.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.390
ANDRE:
I would like
some answers, please.

04:20.564 --> 04:21.913
How about a cup of
tea while you wait?

04:22.087 --> 04:24.220
Earl Grey?

04:24.394 --> 04:25.874
I-I thought I was meeting
with the founder of BHN,

04:26.048 --> 04:28.311
Ms. Sienna Stone?

04:28.442 --> 04:30.531
What do you know about
Ms. Stone?

04:30.705 --> 04:33.011
She works in technology,
and prides herself

04:33.185 --> 04:34.535
on being against the government.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.145
Which I applaud, but...

04:36.319 --> 04:38.278
I'm not sure how much
substance there is

04:38.452 --> 04:40.541
beneath the gleaming surface.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.064
There's more to her
than meets the eye.

04:43.544 --> 04:44.632
Please.

04:54.163 --> 04:55.338
TYLER:
It's time to save

04:55.512 --> 04:57.253
you God-fearing patriots
from these threats

04:57.384 --> 04:59.342
to our way of life.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.257
We are gonna protect
the innocent people

05:01.388 --> 05:03.346
in this country.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.609
We should be doing more.
Where are the authorities?

05:05.783 --> 05:07.568
Why isn't Detroit PD
doing something?

05:07.698 --> 05:10.179
We've been liaising
with the DPD the past few days.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.877
They're monitoring the
situation, but they think

05:13.051 --> 05:16.403
these outbursts of violence
so far are a few bad apples.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.274
These folks,
they've-they've gotten

05:18.448 --> 05:20.798
the appropriate permits
to camp and protest.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.627
Come on. Really?DHS is monitoring,
too, all right?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.803
We're all over this.
But look.

05:25.934 --> 05:30.808
The 4,400 had asked to create
a sanctuary out of the hotel.

05:30.939 --> 05:33.071
We have to make sure we don't
violate that in any way.[scoffs]

05:33.202 --> 05:34.377
It's tricky.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.205
So we do nothing.

05:36.379 --> 05:37.815
Their methods may be crude,

05:37.989 --> 05:40.644
and we certainly condemn them.
Of course.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.777
But this 44orum group
will ultimately demonstrate

05:42.951 --> 05:45.170
that the 4,400
need to be governed.

05:45.301 --> 05:46.998
What does that mean?That the world

05:47.172 --> 05:49.566
will see that the 4,400

05:49.740 --> 05:51.438
can't be left
to their own devices.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.527
They're going to need us
to step in.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
And exactly how many casualties
will there be before then?

05:55.833 --> 05:58.053
I thought
we were protecting people.

05:58.227 --> 06:01.012
The questions you're asking
come with accountability.

06:01.186 --> 06:03.145
Do you really want that?

06:03.319 --> 06:05.452
[phone vibrating]

06:14.069 --> 06:15.679
Damn it, Jessica,
answer the phone.[indistinct shouting]

06:17.899 --> 06:19.901
I think we should get everyone
out through the tunnel

06:20.075 --> 06:22.077
while Mildred
holds the doors closed up here.NELSON: No,

06:22.207 --> 06:23.861
that's gonna be impossible. We
went through the tunnel first,

06:24.035 --> 06:26.255
but the 44orumers were right
behind us. We had to cave it in.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.125
SHANICE: What?LOGAN:
So we're trapped.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.431
KEISHA:
You can barricade

06:28.605 --> 06:29.476
in the hotel rooms.SHANICE:
Okay.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.695
Okay, everyone, find a room

06:31.869 --> 06:34.002
to hide out in. Three or four
of you together. And barricade.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.786
Okay? Quickly!

06:35.917 --> 06:37.919
Let's get to the elevators!
Come on. You guys

06:38.093 --> 06:39.834
get up to my room;
I'll be right behind you.[loud thud]

06:40.008 --> 06:42.053
[indistinct chanting]What was that?

06:42.227 --> 06:44.795
[loud, rhythmic thudding]

06:46.797 --> 06:48.016
Is that a battering ram?

06:48.146 --> 06:51.280
I'm trying, but I can't...!

06:51.454 --> 06:53.848
Okay, everyone
take cover. Now!

07:00.071 --> 07:03.466
[shouting and clamoring]

07:09.385 --> 07:11.822
Find the reverend, their leader.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.738
They'll all fall in line
once we have him.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.012
[indistinct shouting, chanting]

07:29.710 --> 07:30.798
Here's one.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.064
[others screaming]

07:36.194 --> 07:37.674
LOGAN:
No! Hayden!

07:37.848 --> 07:39.023
Let him go! Stop!

07:40.721 --> 07:42.287
Let go of me.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.507
[44orumers grunt]

07:45.552 --> 07:47.423
Come on, follow me.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.077
[whimpers]

07:52.776 --> 07:54.386
Why are we listening
to this Millicent chick?

07:54.561 --> 07:55.997
She's one of them.TYLER:
We need her

07:56.171 --> 07:58.434
in case we got trouble
getting in the hotel.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.305
But she doesn't know
the real plan. We're gonna

08:00.436 --> 08:03.091
round up those iguana-blooded
pieces of 44-filth

08:03.221 --> 08:05.485
and bring them right back here
for extermination.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.443
Yes.Including her.

08:07.574 --> 08:10.011
Yes! Yeah!

08:10.185 --> 08:12.448
[Shanice gasping]We'll take this one

08:12.579 --> 08:14.624
with the others.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.321
You go get more.
Saw them go that way.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.715
To the elevator. Quick.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.981
SHANICE:
What is going on?

08:24.112 --> 08:26.027
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry we have
to be those absolute creepers.

08:26.201 --> 08:27.376
I'm crawling
out of my skin.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.421
Okay, this is freaky,

08:29.596 --> 08:30.945
but not as freaky
as when you were Jessica,

08:31.119 --> 08:32.337
I guess.We have to get our people

08:32.468 --> 08:33.600
out of here.
I'd rather take our chances

08:33.774 --> 08:35.253
out there instead
of being trapped with them

08:35.427 --> 08:36.690
in here. Let's get everyone
to the tunnel.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.561
No. Manny's people
said it was blocked.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.563
Blocked? No, we need that exit.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.261
Yes, we do.
I saw that guy's memory.

08:43.435 --> 08:44.611
They're planning to...

08:44.785 --> 08:46.874
to take us somewhere and...

08:48.049 --> 08:50.355
...kill us.No, Lord.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.227
They're in some
burnt-out warehouse somewhere.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.272
That's their, like, sad
Mad Maxcosplay lair.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.057
I've been there. It's not far.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.624
Good. Y'all figure that out.
I'll head to the tunnel.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.060
Even if I have to rip this body
to shreds,

08:59.234 --> 09:00.583
I'll get it open for us.

09:00.714 --> 09:01.192
And I'm gonna make sure
Logan and Hayden

09:01.366 --> 09:02.411
are safe in my room.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.978
[elevator bell dings]

09:04.152 --> 09:05.936
[elevator door opens]

09:06.110 --> 09:08.112
Pray those monsters haven't
made it to this floor yet.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.471
LADONNA:
Oh, I'm ready to roll up

09:19.646 --> 09:21.082
on their camp,
even if that means

09:21.256 --> 09:22.997
having to be those dummies
for longer.

09:23.171 --> 09:24.955
I can just...
I can just take Mildred,

09:25.129 --> 09:27.218
and we can rain holy hell down
on all of them.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.612
No, no,
we can't do anything rash.Rash?

09:29.743 --> 09:31.309
No. After everything
they did to me,

09:31.483 --> 09:33.311
to my friends, to my dad?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.052
After what they did,

09:35.226 --> 09:38.186
I want them to suffer.
I want them dead.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.317
Yes, I know the feeling.

09:39.448 --> 09:41.058
But anger

09:41.232 --> 09:43.104
and violence will only backfire
on all of you.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.888
And I know it's wrong,

09:45.062 --> 09:47.543
but if you hurt these people,
you become the problem.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.805
So, what do you want us to do?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.546
I want you
to put that hood back on me

09:50.720 --> 09:51.634
and get us both out
of this hotel.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.462
You go back to their camp,

09:53.636 --> 09:55.029
but just to keep
watch, okay?

09:55.203 --> 09:56.204
Make sure
nothing terrible happens

09:56.334 --> 09:57.553
to the 4,400 they already have.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.076
And where are you going?

09:59.250 --> 10:00.774
I'm going to get backup.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.254
[exhales] I know
you can keep things handled

10:03.428 --> 10:04.604
until I can bring back help.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.954
Me? Alone?Yes.

10:07.128 --> 10:10.784
You are as much a leader among
the 4,400 as anybody else.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.481
Embrace your power.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.179
[elevator bell dings]Fine.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.705
Look, those are my friends
down there, Manny.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.489
Innocent people.
Do you understand?

10:20.663 --> 10:23.579
I know, Jha.
And I'm sorry about that.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.582
You're going to have to accept
that many of your friends

10:26.756 --> 10:27.844
will not make it
through the day.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.716
So you're murdering them?

10:29.890 --> 10:31.543
Why?

10:31.718 --> 10:34.590
Because I want to tear
down all the institutions

10:34.764 --> 10:36.592
that maintain
the status quo.

10:36.766 --> 10:40.378
The many 4,400 who survive
today will be hailed as heroes,

10:40.552 --> 10:42.903
but they'll also be vengeful
for the death of their comrades.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.253
They'll use their
powers for change.

10:45.427 --> 10:48.169
They'll activate a country that
needs something to believe in!

10:48.343 --> 10:50.867
It shouldn't take people dying
to do that.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.130
Thousands of people havedied.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.742
Millions more
are suffering.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.396
This?

10:58.570 --> 11:00.529
This is just the start.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.927
I understand

11:07.101 --> 11:09.103
what you want to do.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.322
[sighs]

11:11.496 --> 11:13.455
But I don't believe in it.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.326
[Manny grunts]

11:15.500 --> 11:16.458
I just can't.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.721
Jharrel, let me out of here!

11:18.852 --> 11:20.418
I can't do that, bro.
I got to try and help

11:20.592 --> 11:23.073
the people I care about
survive the day.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.727
[handcuffs rattling]Jharrel!

11:24.901 --> 11:25.989
[door closes]

11:26.163 --> 11:27.991
[indistinct shouting]

11:28.165 --> 11:29.340
SHANICE:
Oh, thank God.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.299
Shanice, come on.Are Logan

11:31.429 --> 11:32.866
and Hayden...?Yeah, they're
already inside.

11:33.040 --> 11:33.997
Come with me, and
I'll barricade us in.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.738
Mildred, there's something
you should know.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.305
They're gonna turn
against your sister.

11:37.435 --> 11:38.480
What? No, she's one
of their leaders.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.177
She's not...They're using her

11:40.351 --> 11:41.962
to get inside.
They think she's just like...

11:42.136 --> 11:43.615
well, us.

11:43.790 --> 11:47.402
Look, I had to tell you
to give you the choice,

11:47.576 --> 11:48.359
but you should stay with us.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.405
She led them in here,

11:50.579 --> 11:52.233
and she can fend for herself.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.888
No, she can't. She doesn't even
know. She thinks that they're...

11:55.018 --> 11:58.108
Look, it's my fault
that she trusts them,

11:58.282 --> 11:59.370
and it's my fault that she's
put herself in danger.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.459
Mildred, please, stay.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.026
I can't just give up on her.

12:08.205 --> 12:10.033
Please, be careful.

12:10.164 --> 12:12.166
You, too.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.386
Okay.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.478
Get the chair.
Put it against the door.LOGAN: Grab this?

12:20.652 --> 12:21.915
Yes, yes.All right.
[grunting]

12:23.220 --> 12:24.526
[whispers]:
Okay.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.964
Ow.
[exhales]

12:29.705 --> 12:31.751
Oh, my God, Logan.
You're hurt.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.799
It must have happened
during the scuffle or something.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.758
Okay, we-we have to get you
to the hospital.No,

12:38.932 --> 12:40.847
no, no,
you-you can't go out that door.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.413
It's the only thing that's
keeping us safe right now,

12:42.587 --> 12:43.414
keeping Hayden safe.

12:43.588 --> 12:44.851
We can wait it out.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.591
44ORUMER:
All right, kick the door in!

12:46.722 --> 12:48.419
Mr. Kaminski, it-it looks bad.LOGAN:
Hey.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.378
It's gonna be okay. All right?

12:57.385 --> 12:59.300
[indistinct chatter]

12:59.474 --> 13:02.825
Whoa! Can't stop
every bullet at once.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.959
Take me to Millicent.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.623
CLAUDETTE:
Oh, thank God. Renee.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.887
You get that tunnel clear?Best you get upstairs.

13:21.061 --> 13:22.366
Help the helpless
to their rooms.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.979
CLAUDETTE:
It looks fine. Aren't we

13:26.153 --> 13:27.458
trying to get everyone out?Like I said,

13:27.632 --> 13:29.417
you should help the others.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.116
Uh, right.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.640
All right, of course.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.861
Claudette. Thank God.
The emergency lines

13:38.992 --> 13:40.776
are jammed.
I'm running out to...[Claudette grunts]

13:44.084 --> 13:45.433
I think one of Manny's team--

13:45.607 --> 13:47.261
my team--

13:47.435 --> 13:49.350
went rogue.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.655
This right here is a bomb your
brother taught us to build.

13:52.092 --> 13:54.094
Let's see.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.660
And this looks like a map
showing where more of them

13:55.835 --> 13:57.358
are planted
around the hotel.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.535
[clears throat]
She didn't go rogue.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.276
This is Manny's plan.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.887
To trap the 44orumers in
here and bomb them to hell?

14:05.061 --> 14:06.323
Yeah, along with the rest of us.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.586
He claims he wants
to tear down everything

14:08.760 --> 14:09.761
so the nation can rebuild.

14:09.936 --> 14:10.719
I heard him talk
that way before,

14:10.893 --> 14:12.242
but not about this.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.592
We're supposed to be
defending ourselves.

14:14.723 --> 14:15.942
I don't know. All right?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.465
He claims that he came
from the future.

14:17.595 --> 14:18.945
I don't know
what to believe.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.511
It's like
he's not even my brother.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.600
Yeah, well, I got a
few words for him.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.298
But first...[exhales]

14:35.613 --> 14:36.963
Now come on.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.965
[exhales]

14:40.705 --> 14:41.750
[indistinct shouting
in distance]

14:41.924 --> 14:43.143
[breathing shakily]

14:43.317 --> 14:45.362
Look, I got you, Mr. Kaminski.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.147
I don't know why
Andre's not picking up.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.758
God, I hope he's okay.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.327
[phone ringing]

14:53.501 --> 14:56.547
It's Mariah. Oh.

14:56.721 --> 14:57.766
Are you okay?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.637
Is Dad okay? Are you safe?

14:59.768 --> 15:02.292
We're-we're safe
for now. Uh,

15:02.466 --> 15:03.250
we're trapped in the hotel
at the moment.LOGAN: Give me your hand.

15:03.424 --> 15:04.294
But, Mariah,

15:04.468 --> 15:06.383
be-be careful.

15:06.557 --> 15:09.082
They know your face, too,
from the Meet the 4,400 Event.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.997
Where's Dad?
He's-he's not picking up.Hey.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.999
Hey, Ri. Hey.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.001
You look funny. Are you...

15:15.175 --> 15:16.741
What? Feeling better
now that I see

15:16.872 --> 15:18.787
that beautiful face?
You better believe it.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.876
[laughs]Oh, Dad.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.878
Hey, Hayden.

15:23.009 --> 15:25.054
How you hanging in there?

15:25.228 --> 15:28.231
Really wish I had my
getaway driver right about now.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.929
LOGAN:
Hey, hey. It's too soon,

15:30.103 --> 15:31.626
Hayden. Too soon.[all laugh]

15:31.800 --> 15:32.801
[loud indistinct shouting][pounding on door]

15:36.457 --> 15:38.328
Listen,

15:38.459 --> 15:39.895
I-I've done
enough active shooter drills

15:40.069 --> 15:41.375
at school. They-they might help.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.594
Um, I'm sure you guys
have already done this,

15:43.768 --> 15:44.769
but make sure
that your phones are on silent.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.597
And they usually come in firing,

15:46.771 --> 15:49.426
so make sure that no one's
in front of the door.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.951
And, um, don't move
any of the wounded.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.822
Are any of you hurt?

15:55.041 --> 15:56.912
No. No.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.393
And...

15:59.567 --> 16:02.178
lastly,
we have to get off this phone.

16:03.484 --> 16:07.618
Hey, I'm so proud
of you, Ri.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.969
I know.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.448
We're gonna get out of this.

16:11.622 --> 16:14.016
Okay, Mariah?
We-We'll see you soon.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.626
I love you.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.977
Love you, too.Love you.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.418
[grunting]

16:24.592 --> 16:25.810
Hey. Hey.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.986
[shouting continues]

16:31.686 --> 16:33.862
[footsteps approaching]

16:34.036 --> 16:35.603
Ms. Stone apologizes
for the delay.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.953
Something's come up

16:38.127 --> 16:39.650
that requires
her immediate attention.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.088
Well, then take me
back. All I asked for

16:42.262 --> 16:43.393
is supplies to help
me with my research,

16:43.524 --> 16:45.047
not some wild-goose chase.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.225
FARRADAY:
May I?

16:52.663 --> 16:54.883
[chimes, whirs]

16:57.625 --> 16:59.322
Your ZMT levels
are about where we'd expect

16:59.496 --> 17:01.455
for a 4,400.Wait.

17:01.629 --> 17:03.631
This measures...

17:03.761 --> 17:05.111
How did you know?That you're interested

17:05.285 --> 17:06.895
in ZMT?Well,

17:07.069 --> 17:08.462
yes.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.291
And how do you possess
this technology

17:11.465 --> 17:14.120
that exists nowhere in
the research I've done?

17:14.294 --> 17:15.947
Sienna Stone.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.950
I'm sure she'd be fascinated
to know your power.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.040
It has manifested, hasn't it?

17:22.911 --> 17:24.826
Still want to head back?

17:27.655 --> 17:30.092
I'm glad you came. Sorry I
haven't been answering...

17:30.223 --> 17:31.789
Why the hell isn't DHS
helping the 4,400?

17:31.963 --> 17:33.356
[door closes]This is domestic terrorism,

17:33.530 --> 17:35.184
and you know damn well
law enforcement

17:35.358 --> 17:36.359
would be all over this
if those people

17:36.533 --> 17:38.405
looked more like me.I know. I know.

17:38.579 --> 17:40.363
I just don't know what I can do.Call in the National Guard.

17:40.537 --> 17:41.930
There's protocol and red tape,

17:42.104 --> 17:42.887
and technically,
Bill has to sign off on...

17:43.018 --> 17:43.671
So we go over his head!

17:43.845 --> 17:44.889
I'll reach out

17:45.064 --> 17:46.543
to every contact
I have at DPD,

17:46.717 --> 17:47.979
and I'll give
anyone who needs it

17:48.154 --> 17:49.894
a firsthand account
from inside.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.028
We have to do whatever we can,

17:53.159 --> 17:54.247
Jess.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.683
I...

17:56.684 --> 17:59.252
You're right. We do.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.254
Ido.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.956
What else did you hide from me?

18:08.130 --> 18:09.175
I never would have been
party to planting bombs

18:09.349 --> 18:10.915
that could kill
innocent people.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.395
Which is exactly
why I didn't tell you.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.267
You were ready for a lot,

18:14.441 --> 18:15.964
but you weren't prepared
to make that sacrifice.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
Even though you know

18:17.748 --> 18:19.185
this is how real change happens.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.838
With a body count?

18:21.012 --> 18:24.842
If there were 50 police murders
in a day,

18:25.016 --> 18:27.541
if there was
a school shooting every day,

18:27.715 --> 18:29.108
do you think

18:29.282 --> 18:31.936
people would still
be able to look away?

18:32.067 --> 18:33.764
Would people still think
that we could solve things

18:33.938 --> 18:35.636
by making nice?

18:35.810 --> 18:37.942
You're destroying a sanctuary,
Manny.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.553
All right? People came here

18:39.727 --> 18:41.729
to feel safe.They were never safe.

18:41.859 --> 18:44.166
You know I agree on that, but
you're talking about making it

18:44.340 --> 18:46.821
even less so. These
are my friends.

18:46.995 --> 18:50.390
People I care about.
People that are only doing good.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.566
But this is
how they do the most good.

18:53.871 --> 18:56.047
To summarize our latest trial,

18:56.222 --> 19:00.878
in which we sent 2,547 people
to 2021,

19:01.052 --> 19:03.533
we are definitely
seeing improvements.

19:03.664 --> 19:06.232
Poverty came down
by one eighth of a percent,

19:06.406 --> 19:08.886
and the Latinx population
showed some political gains.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.888
So, if we continue to augment

19:11.062 --> 19:12.542
the number of returnees...We've run the experiment

19:12.716 --> 19:14.675
over 30 times.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.546
We should have created

19:16.677 --> 19:18.983
a whole new world by now,
but everything is the same.

19:19.114 --> 19:20.420
Well, in our next trial,

19:20.594 --> 19:23.205
we anticipate a 16% increase

19:23.379 --> 19:24.685
in the possibility...It's not enough!

19:24.815 --> 19:26.991
None of it is!

19:27.122 --> 19:28.863
We sit here all day
in this pristine office,

19:29.037 --> 19:31.431
acting as if the world outside
doesn't exist.

19:32.432 --> 19:33.737
But it does.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.264
The majority of the country
is nearly uninhabitable.

19:38.438 --> 19:39.917
Are the so-called leaders
in this room

19:40.091 --> 19:41.789
actually fighting
for fundamental change?

19:41.919 --> 19:43.791
Or just enough
to maintain your status quo?

19:43.965 --> 19:47.055
We are trying to help.

The video I posted
of their camp went viral.

They-they thought
they'd be glorified

32:29.077 --> 32:31.123
