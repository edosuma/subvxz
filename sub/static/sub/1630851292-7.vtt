Mayor West's bags

Leather chaps.

09:43.992 --> 09:45.917
Saddle. Bullwhip.

09:46.069 --> 09:48.569
Rope. Sheriff's badges.

09:48.589 --> 09:53.258
Saddlebags. Saddle soap.
Fancy boots.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.218
-Yep, this is ours.
-Yep, this is mine.

09:59.415 --> 10:01.658

I've devised a way

10:01.751 --> 10:04.085

and Doctor Hartman together.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.662
You see,
I've prepared a batch

10:05.680 --> 10:07.755
of Martha Stewart's
chokiest scones.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.500
So when the Librarian eats one,
she'll start choking,

10:10.518 --> 10:12.593
and Doctor Hartman over there
will save her

10:12.687 --> 10:14.070
with the Heimlich maneuver.

10:14.764 --> 10:16.698
Here she comes!

10:18.176 --> 10:20.026

10:40.715 --> 10:42.140
Okay, remain calm.

Stop, drop and roll.

do the tummy-squeezy move."

15:27.260 --> 15:29.260
Well, if it were me

-Threesome?

15:45.003 --> 15:46.611

16:40.241 --> 16:42.149
and I always held it
against you,

16:42.243 --> 16:45.394

i-it wasn't your fault.

there's already
an hour and 45-minute wait.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.742
So go ahead and write
down the song you want to sing,

20:44.893 --> 20:46.077
hand it to me,
and I will let

20:46.304 --> 20:48.562
15 musical theater people
go before you.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.730
Remember, no repeats.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.490
We want to give everybody
a chance to sing,

20:51.584 --> 20:54.735
although there will be the same
rotation of five people up here

20:54.829 --> 20:56.254
over and over doing duets.

20:56.481 --> 20:58.739
All right, who's ready
for me to kick things off

20:58.833 --> 21:01.133
and then go third and sixth?
