-Yes, but I--

00:54.080 --> 00:55.000

Remember, she thinks

Hi, Mrs. Hanan, it's nice to meet you.

01:01.840 --> 01:03.240

Yeah, I just need
to get off the bus, please.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.400
He jizzed on me.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.160
What the shit is this?

04:16.840 --> 04:18.280
It's my magician's hankie.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.240
You're not a fucking magician, Jeffrey.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.240
-Maeve.
-Yeah?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.600
You know what today is, don't you?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.240
Rent day.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.000
Oh, yeah,
Uh, I'll get that to you later today.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.400
Oh.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.960
Such a sweet boy.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.760
Apparently, it was a terrible incident.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.200
He was attacked... by a gang of youths.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.160
Shouldn't be so nosy, Cynthia.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.080
Magic that hankie to the bin, Jeffrey.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.440
Twat.

04:59.440 --> 05:00.920
- Michael.
-What?

05:01.680 --> 05:02.800
He <i>is </i>trying.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.520
-Sorry, Dad.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.480
I've got you a trial shift at Brown's
this evening at eight.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.160
He's doing me a favor so do not be late.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.360
Why are you wearing a scarf?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.680
-Is that for Rahim?
-No.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.920
-No. I just like scarves, okay?
-Uh-huh.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.800
-Dude, why is your mum still here?
-I don't know.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.760
-She lives here, apparently.
-Hello, Eric.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.240
-Hello, darling.
-Don't address me at school, Mum.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.400
Oh, don't forget dinner tonight.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.280
It's okay, that's it. You can go back
to pretending I don't exist.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.960
What's dinner tonight?

05:55.040 --> 05:58.520
Dinner tonight is me,
my mum, Ola, and Jakob

05:58.600 --> 06:02.160
all getting to know each other
like a big happy family.

06:02.240 --> 06:05.240
I can't believe
you finally get a girlfriend

06:05.320 --> 06:09.080
and she's basically your sister.
LOLs. LOLs.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.280
Oh, you don't think
anyone will tell your mum

06:12.360 --> 06:14.880
about the whole sex clinic thing though,
do you?

06:15.480 --> 06:16.920
'Cause that'll be awkward.

06:17.800 --> 06:18.640
Innit?

06:21.320 --> 06:22.960
Everyone's gonna talk to your mum?

06:23.040 --> 06:24.760
No one will talk to my mum
about anything...

06:24.840 --> 06:26.600
-Yeah, especially not--
-Good morning, Eric.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.640
-Morning, Rahim.
-I like your scarf.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.320
Oh, this? Forgot I had it on.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.560
Could I ask you something?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.200
Yeah.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.160
Hmm.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.640
-Oh, yeah. Um...

06:43.720 --> 06:45.720
All right, yeah, I'll just go inside.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.560
-Yeah, okay. Cool.
-Okay.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.160
Um...

06:50.600 --> 06:53.240
I was wondering if you would like
to go out with me sometime?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.280
What? Like, on... on a date?

06:55.360 --> 06:57.480
Yeah. Maybe tonight?

06:57.560 --> 06:58.800
Y-Yes, sure.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.000
Cool, I'll be there.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.560
Cool, um, you decide what we do,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.920
'cause I don't know what's cool to do
in this town.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.280
Ooh.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.080
-You auditioning for the play?
- Yeah, I'm going up for Juliet.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.680
Who's that?

07:22.240 --> 07:25.080

Someone just gave it to me. It's stupid.

Shit.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.080
Lily, hi. Uh, question.

08:45.720 --> 08:49.360
Did you just... You didn't tell my mum
about the whole, you know, my...

08:50.400 --> 08:51.440
Being a sex wizard?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.320
Yeah.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.720
No. It didn't come up.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.360
-What are you looking at?
- My mum.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.280
-It's my mum.
-Wow, she's really getting to you.

09:16.680 --> 09:17.600
I don't trust her.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.600
So dinner tonight's gonna be interesting.

09:21.920 --> 09:25.000
We don't have to go.
How about we tell them we're not going?

09:25.080 --> 09:27.800
Come on. At least they're trying
to make it less weird.

09:29.080 --> 09:32.160
If it gets too much, we can just go
to your room and play <i>Smash Bros.</i>

09:34.760 --> 09:35.600
-Okay.
-Okay?

09:35.680 --> 09:37.360
-Yes, okay. Um...
-Awesome.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.560
I'll see you later.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.680
-I need to see Otis.
-Okay.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.640
Uh, no, we don't do discounts.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.800
It's all I've got
until I get my pocket money.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.760
You have a sex problem,
but you still get pocket money?

09:51.560 --> 09:54.360
-Well, we're not a charity, okay?

09:54.440 --> 09:56.320
So come back with the cash,
and I'll book you in.

09:58.960 --> 09:59.920
New client?

10:00.320 --> 10:03.000
No.
Got a couple tomorrow though.

10:03.720 --> 10:04.720
Look, um...

10:05.400 --> 10:08.360
I think my mum being on campus
might be bad for business.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.440
-I think you're being paranoid.
-You don't know my mum, all right?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.360
She says she's just doing research.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.480
Before you know it,
she's in everyone's head.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.280
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.960
Happy birthday!

10:28.440 --> 10:29.800
I baked a cake!

10:31.320 --> 10:34.400
-Why didn't you say it was your birthday?
-Because I hate birthdays.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.160
No one hates birthdays, Maeve.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.360
Why celebrate the day I got pushed out
of some random vagina against my will?

10:39.440 --> 10:42.760
Think of all those gems
of nihilistic wisdom

10:42.840 --> 10:45.360
the world would be missing
if you hadn't been born.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.120
Happy birthday, oh, joyous one.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.720
Just tell him you like him, already.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.760
So, what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

10:55.840 --> 10:56.800
Nothing.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.920
What happened to this cake, exactly?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.720
Oh, it didn't look so bad before,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.920
but then I was on the bus,
and a guy wanked on my leg,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.840
and I got a bit of a shock,
and I smushed the cake.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.200
What?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.240
Do you think it'll stain?

11:10.520 --> 11:11.840
I love these jeans.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.320
You... you have to report it.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.160
It's fine, they were only cheap.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.240
No, you've been assaulted.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.800
I think he was just lonely,
or not right in the head or something,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.920
which is weird
'cause he was quite handsome.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.320
Aimes, this is serious.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.520
It's silly. I'm fine, honestly.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.560
Okay. I know what I want to do
for my birthday.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.160
I want us to go to the police.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.760
Where did you take Ola on your first date?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.400
Um... we didn't really go on any dates.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.760
Just started hanging out.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.800
What do you mean?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.760
You know, like playing video games,

11:58.040 --> 12:00.080
talking, eating cereal.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.640
Otis, that's what you and me do.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.800
Yes, except I don't kiss you.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.840
I think French people
like to go on proper dates.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.720
-Where should I take him?
-Okay, just don't stress.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.680
Just as long as you guys are together,
I don't think it matters.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.280
I don't even know why I'm asking you.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.360
You've never even been on a date.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.920
<i>Juicy.</i>

12:32.520 --> 12:34.680
How are your chats
with the students going?

12:35.560 --> 12:37.000
Seems a little quiet.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.560
It's... still early.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.920
Hmm.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.640
I wanted to reiterate
that you have not been employed

12:44.720 --> 12:46.200
at Moordale as a counselor.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.240
Yes.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.040
You've made that more than clear.

12:51.440 --> 12:55.040
I'm only speaking to the students
about the curriculum.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.880
If they ever come to speak to you,
that is.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.200
Welcome!

13:02.880 --> 13:04.600
Hi, I'm here to talk about SRE stuff.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.200
Yes, of course you are.
Please, have a seat,

13:07.280 --> 13:13.240
and... could you possibly just
close the door on your way out, Mr. Groff?

13:14.720 --> 13:15.920
Thank you!

13:18.680 --> 13:19.640
Right.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.960
What's your name?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.200
Malek Amir.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.920
Malek Amir. Nice to meet you, Malek.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.600
I don't have to pay for this, do I?

13:28.680 --> 13:29.640
No.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.400
Right, so...

13:34.200 --> 13:39.240
what do you feel the SRE curriculum
is currently missing?

13:39.320 --> 13:41.480
Okay, so a friend of mine

13:42.000 --> 13:45.560
is dating a girl
who keeps putting a pillow over his face

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
when they have sex.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.520
Would the curriculum cover that, maybe?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.200
Interesting.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.520
Adding fetish to the curriculum
could be a... a real asset.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.600
Fetish?

14:01.160 --> 14:04.600
Yes, there are hundreds
of sexual fetishes, actually,

14:04.680 --> 14:09.200
and, lo and behold,
they often start during puberty.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.840
Well, you know,
covering a person's face during sex

14:13.920 --> 14:18.040
could be anything
from a desire to engage in, well,

14:18.120 --> 14:22.880
breath play, or even encasement fantasy,

14:22.960 --> 14:27.120
or sometimes, although very rare,
ghost fetish.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.840
-Ghost fetish?
-Yeah.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.840
When one covers another's face
because they secretly have a desire

14:33.920 --> 14:38.000
to engage in sexual activity
with a spirit or a ghost.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.400
So my girlfriend's insane.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.360
I thought you said
it was your friend's girlfriend?

14:45.440 --> 14:46.640
I've gotta go.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.400
Fascinating.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.920
Wow. Who knew?

15:12.320 --> 15:13.480
Do you wanna fuck a ghost?

15:14.640 --> 15:15.680
What?

15:15.760 --> 15:17.560
Well, whatever
your face-covering fetish is,

15:17.640 --> 15:19.880
you need to sort it out,
because it's weird and it's scary

15:19.960 --> 15:21.920
and it's just making me feel
just very unsafe.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.720
I'll get a form
for you to fill in.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.360
See, she's got a proper problem.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.920
You've got a proper problem.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.600
Pothole on the high street.
Bloody council.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
Come on, let's go.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.520
It's basically like he sneezed on me
or something.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.280
He came on you, Aimee. Yeah?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.480
Yeah.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.120
Cum is kind of like a penis
having a sneeze.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.360
Ugh! That means
when you swallow someone's cum,

16:00.440 --> 16:01.520
it's like eating their snot.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.520
Take a seat,
we'll be with you in a bit.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.880
-Hi there, how can I help you?
-Hi.

16:11.640 --> 16:15.440
This is my friend Aimee.
She got sexually assaulted on the bus.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.560
I got jizz on my jeans.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.720
I mean, we're probably wasting your time.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.240
You're not wasting anyone's time,
all right?

16:23.320 --> 16:25.000
Do you need to call somebody?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.720
Shit, do I need a lawyer?
Am I gonna get arrested?

16:27.800 --> 16:30.240
No, sorry. I just meant, like,
your mum or someone.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.840
Oh, God, no.
She'll just make it into a drama.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.880
Right. Take a seat,
fill out one of these forms,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.320
and an officer will be with you
in a minute.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.760
-Thank you.
-Uh, you forgot your cake.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.680
Oh.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.520
-Is it someone's birthday?
-Yeah, mine.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.160
Oh, <i>feliz navidad.</i>

16:46.240 --> 16:47.680
That means "merry Christmas."

16:47.760 --> 16:48.880
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.440
Hmm.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.240
Men are so weird.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.400
I think he's cute.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.200
Why do people always think
old men are cute?

17:04.920 --> 17:07.560
How do you know he hasn't jizzed
on someone on a bus before?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.120
I meant the lizard.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.320
What's going on?

17:34.600 --> 17:37.360
So... this year's school production

17:37.440 --> 17:39.240
of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

17:39.320 --> 17:42.200
is not only gonna be a play, but also...

17:42.280 --> 17:43.680
drum roll, please...

17:46.560 --> 17:48.760
...a musical, yo!

17:48.840 --> 17:49.960
Huh?

17:50.040 --> 17:54.480
Who's pumped? Who's pumped?
I'm pumped. Yeah?

17:54.560 --> 17:59.480
It will be written and assistant-directed
by Swing Band's very own Lily Iglehart,

18:00.080 --> 18:04.840
and auditions will be held
bright and early tomorrow morning.

18:04.920 --> 18:07.800
Now, I've got a really special feeling
about this one, guys.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.280
It's a chance for everyone
to really find their place... and shine.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.800
Hey, you forgot your audition speech.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.520
What is this I see?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.880
Jackson Marchetti auditioning
for the lowly school play?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.000
Will wonders never cease?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.080
I don't really understand Shakespeare,
sir, it doesn't make sense.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.760
Well, that's the beauty
of will.i.am-bic pentameter.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
Okay, thanks.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.880
Hello.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.320
Uh, not history.

18:55.400 --> 18:58.680
Oh, no, I'm Michael's wife, Maureen.

18:58.760 --> 19:03.480
Oh. Sorry. Jean. Sex ed-ish.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.080
Hello.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.600
It's Mr. Groff's dinner.
I drop it in on Wednesdays.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.400
He works late, marking.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.920
-How are you getting along?
-Good.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.600
Good, yeah.
Think I'm getting the hang of it.

19:15.680 --> 19:16.680
Yes.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.320
Michael used to come home
on the verge of tears most nights

19:19.400 --> 19:20.840
during his first term as headmaster.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.280
Oh, don't tell him I said that.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.120
Anyway, glad you're toughing it out.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.520
Thank you.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.560
I... was wondering whether...

19:40.440 --> 19:41.560
Yes, what is it?

19:47.720 --> 19:49.920
I was wondering whether...

19:52.720 --> 19:55.800
you could tell me where you got
that shade of lipstick from?

19:57.520 --> 19:59.040
It's fabulous.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.080
Well, I don't remember.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.160
But next time you're here,

20:06.240 --> 20:09.840
why don't you pop in
and I'll let you know?

20:10.800 --> 20:11.680
Great.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.960
-Well, I better get Mr. Grumpy his food.
-Yes.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.040
It's nice to meet you, Jean.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.880
Nice to meet you too, Maureen.

20:38.240 --> 20:40.400
Do you wanna hang at mine
before your date?

20:40.480 --> 20:43.760
I can't. I haven't decided
what I'm gonna wear. What should I wear?

20:43.840 --> 20:46.240
-Wow. How the tables have turned.
-Oh, Otis,

20:46.320 --> 20:48.640
I don't have time for this conversation.
I have to go home

20:48.720 --> 20:50.240
and try on everything I own.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.320
Well, maybe just lose the scarf.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.680
Maybe lose your virginity?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.080
Olivia, Jesus!

21:00.160 --> 21:01.520
You could have killed yourself.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.320
Thanks to your mum,
my boyfriend thinks I wanna kill him.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.280
Why?

21:05.720 --> 21:09.600
Because I sometimes do this thing, okay,
where I cover his face with a pillow

21:10.040 --> 21:13.760
just when I cum
and now your mum thinks I have a fetish.

21:14.880 --> 21:18.240
-Which you don't?
-I have an ugly cum face, okay?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.520
I've seen it in the mirror before.
It's bad.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.640
I look like a python swallowing an egg,
and Malek always looks perfect.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.080
Well...

21:25.520 --> 21:29.680
that's normal to feel observed
and vulnerable when you're having sex.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.640
And he probably feels
just as silly sometimes, too.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.440
We... we might think we look stupid
or unappealing,

21:40.520 --> 21:44.840
but sex isn't always perfect
and it should be about feeling good,

21:44.920 --> 21:46.760
not looking pretty.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.560
It's a privilege
to see your partner like that.

21:51.320 --> 21:54.280
So maybe you and your boyfriend
need to work on your trust,

21:54.360 --> 21:57.600
so you can show him yourself fully,
like, all the bits.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.800
Even the bits you think might be ugly,

22:00.320 --> 22:02.600
'cause I bet he doesn't think they are
at all.

22:04.760 --> 22:05.680
And...

22:06.880 --> 22:08.800
there's something I think might help.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.800
I got a B plus in algebra.

22:14.480 --> 22:15.920
You know that's not very impressive?

22:16.000 --> 22:18.320
-So, do you want to do your English

22:18.400 --> 22:19.560
or maths homework today?

22:21.400 --> 22:22.280
Well...

22:25.360 --> 22:29.000
actually, I was thinking
of auditioning for the school play,

22:29.080 --> 22:33.200
but I don't understand Shakespeare,
and I wondered if you could help me.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.120
-Not my remit. Maths or English.
-Come on.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.280
Look, I'd never have got
a B plus in algebra if it wasn't for you.

22:39.840 --> 22:44.000
And I'm sure you've got
some Shakespeare tricks up your sleeve?

22:44.560 --> 22:46.480
Please.

22:46.560 --> 22:47.480
You're not cute.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.120
Why do you wanna audition anyway?

22:50.200 --> 22:52.680
Well, I'm taking your advice
and getting a backup plan.

22:52.760 --> 22:54.840
When I played Joseph
in my primary school Nativity,

22:54.920 --> 22:56.240
people said I was very believable.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.240
-Of course you played Joseph.
-Come on.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.360
Please. You're a tutoring genius.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.080
Fine.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.560
-But this is a one-time thing.
-Yeah.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.960
Read me the speech.

23:10.360 --> 23:11.480
-Now?
-Yeah.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.200
All right.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.000
All right.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.920
"It is my lady, oh, it is my love,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.080
-oh, that she knew she wor--"
-Why are you reading it

23:24.160 --> 23:27.000
-like it's a shopping list?
-Because it makes no sense.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.720
It's poetry.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.560
Once you've got the rhythm,
the words take on meaning.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.920
So, each line has ten syllables,
made up of five heartbeats.

23:36.400 --> 23:40.000
Ba-boom, ba-boom,
ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.760
You try.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.680
"Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon,

23:53.560 --> 23:57.000
who is already sick and pale with grief."

23:58.160 --> 24:00.240
So you've got the rhythm and the words.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.800
Now you need the emotion.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.000
This speech is about love.

24:06.960 --> 24:12.400
So, try thinking of someone
who makes you feel a lot when you say it.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.280
Ooh.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.280
Hope I get my jeans back.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.080
Do you really want them back, though?

24:26.840 --> 24:30.560
Yeah, they're the perfect bootleg, Maeve.
You don't find that very often.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.720
It's true.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.480
-Do you think they're watching us?
-Yeah, probably.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.880
-Oh!
-No.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.320
-Aimee.
-I'm sorry, I'm really nervous.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.800
That wasn't me.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.800
Sorry, I fart when I'm scared.

24:55.800 --> 24:56.800
Okay.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.680
All right...

25:00.640 --> 25:02.840
Thanks for the jeans, Aimee.

25:03.840 --> 25:04.880
Where were we?

25:05.920 --> 25:06.960
So...

25:07.960 --> 25:12.360
fair hair, clean-shaven,
five feet eight or nine...

25:13.640 --> 25:15.760
and a blue jacket.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.120
It was kind of aqua.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.280
And was he already on the bus?

25:20.760 --> 25:21.600
Yeah.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.800
I think so.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.640
He might have got on at the second stop.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.520
Well, it's really important to know
what stop he got on at

25:29.600 --> 25:31.760
so we can get
as clear a picture as possible.

25:31.840 --> 25:34.240
So you said you remember smiling at him.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.920
Was that after the first stop
or the second?

25:37.440 --> 25:39.560
Sorry,
what's that got to do with anything?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.200
Are you saying
she shouldn't have smiled at him?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.680
Charges like this
are really hard to convict,

25:45.760 --> 25:50.680
and if we do actually catch the guy,
the questions are gonna get harder.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.080
Can I have my jeans back, please?

25:53.160 --> 25:55.240
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry to make a fuss.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.160
Aimes, um...

25:58.680 --> 26:02.080
...what if he does this
to someone else? I know you can do this.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.400
Please?

26:05.640 --> 26:08.000
-You're doing brilliantly, Aimee.
- Yeah.

26:11.160 --> 26:13.280
Just take your time.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.320
Try to remember.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.560
He was already on the bus.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.760
How was your day at school, Ola?

26:35.320 --> 26:36.280
Good.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.440
How was your day at school, Mum?

26:41.520 --> 26:43.680
Having fun hanging out with all my peers?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.280
It was very good, thank you.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.840
-Dad.
-Hmm?

26:59.920 --> 27:01.520
-Stop.
-Oh, sorry.

27:02.360 --> 27:05.160
I eat like a pig sometimes.

27:06.840 --> 27:08.920
I've been alone for too many years.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.400
Hmm.

27:10.480 --> 27:13.800
My mum's been single a long time too.
She doesn't eat like that.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.080
Otis!

27:18.120 --> 27:19.280
Um...

27:19.800 --> 27:22.640
this is delicious.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.680
Mmm.

27:25.680 --> 27:26.600
You don't eat this?

27:27.440 --> 27:29.200
Otis doesn't like fat.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.240
Oh, really?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.720
-Ah, um...
-Can I have it, then?

27:35.520 --> 27:37.640
Do you have any more? No.

27:37.720 --> 27:38.760
Thank you.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.200
Fat is the best bits.

27:42.760 --> 27:43.760
Oh.

27:43.840 --> 27:45.240
It's bad for your heart.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.440
Really? It's not a proven fact.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.720
Well, I disagree.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.200
I'm okay with that.

27:56.880 --> 27:57.840
Right.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.560
Why don't we all take a deep breath

28:03.120 --> 28:06.280
and tell each other
exactly how we're feeling?

28:06.680 --> 28:10.080
Let's start by saying
the first words that come into our minds.

28:10.560 --> 28:12.560
Okay, I'll start. Annoyed.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.480
Immature.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.520
Selfish.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.080
Uncomfortable.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.000
Invasion.

28:22.240 --> 28:23.880
Overly sensitive.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.720
That's two words, Mum.

28:26.920 --> 28:28.000
Monopoly.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.000
Why don't we all play Monopoly instead?

28:40.120 --> 28:42.360
You guys ready? Give you a lift.

28:43.120 --> 28:44.960
Is the lizard going to jail?

28:45.600 --> 28:47.760
No, his owner has Alzheimer's.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.040
Forgets why he's here and then he forgets
to take this dude home.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.560
Should we get some dinner, Neil,
and then we'll drop these two on the way?

29:02.520 --> 29:06.160
Oh, don't worry. No need for a payment.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.600
Um, enjoy your stay at my hotel.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.520
I'm paying you,
it's just I will have to remortgage.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.800
No, you don't have to.
I have so much money, I don't need more.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.760
Okay, that's not how the game works.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.320
I'm not breaking the rules.
Four hundred pounds, please.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.480
I said it's fine.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.120
I said it's not fine.

29:28.520 --> 29:29.520
I don't want it.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.520
I want you to have it.

29:32.200 --> 29:35.880
Well, if we're playing by the rules,
you owe me £600.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.840
Six hundred.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.120
Mmm...

29:42.200 --> 29:45.000
-I think you're bankrupt.
-Fuck, I know I'm bankrupt!

29:50.200 --> 29:52.760
Right, I'll make some tea.

29:54.320 --> 29:57.520
Why? Why do we think
this is a normal situation?

29:57.600 --> 29:58.960
Ola is my girlfriend,

29:59.040 --> 30:01.760
you are not my dad,
and this is not a fucking family.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.000
You shouldn't swear at your mother.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.640
Thank you, Jakob,
but I don't need help parenting my child.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.720
Okay. I think I should go home.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.000
Let you guys sort things out.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.880
He's always...
He's here all the time, and I...

30:21.720 --> 30:22.960
I'll see you at school.

30:28.240 --> 30:31.120
I want you to go and apologize to Jakob
first thing in the morning.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.200
Sure, I mean,
I'm not gonna have to go anywhere,

30:33.280 --> 30:34.800
considering he practically lives here.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.280
I understand that you're angry.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.440
But I'm happy with Jakob.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.280
Why can't you be happy for me?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.480
No, you're pretending to be happy, Mum.

30:45.680 --> 30:47.360
You're not the relationship type.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.920
Stop kidding yourself.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.840
Or maybe you're just not as independent
as you thought.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.240
Go to your room!

30:55.240 --> 30:56.280
I'm 16.

30:57.480 --> 30:58.360
Fine!

30:58.920 --> 31:00.880
Well, then I'll go to mine!

31:25.160 --> 31:26.480
Hey.

31:27.640 --> 31:28.880
You found it okay then?

31:28.960 --> 31:32.440
Yeah. This town is very small, so, yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:33.880
Cool.

31:53.520 --> 31:57.040
Where did you get this cake?
Demand your money back.

31:57.640 --> 31:58.560
Aimee made it.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.240
Oh, sorry, Aimee.
I'm just not used to some of the flavors.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.400
Mmm, it's okay, it's my first cake.

32:04.880 --> 32:06.880
I'm gonna be a baker when I leave school.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.360
Sounds like a good plan.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.360
Uh, you having a birthday party?

32:10.440 --> 32:11.560
No.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.400
She hates birthdays.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.440
Why? Birthdays are great.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.360
Aren't you doing something nice
with your fella?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.000
I don't have a boyfriend.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.560
She is in love with a boy though.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.240
She's just too afraid to tell him
how she feels,

32:26.320 --> 32:29.720
which is stupid
because he clearly loves her back.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.440
Shut up, Aimee, you don't know that.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.320
I think you should tell him how you feel.
What have you got to lose?

32:41.520 --> 32:47.600
Uh, um, sorry. I actually ordered
the special, the fishy something?

32:47.680 --> 32:51.600
Vichyssoise, it's a chilled soup.

32:52.120 --> 32:53.480
Steak's on the way.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.200
Cool, great.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.240
Mmm.

33:03.720 --> 33:06.600
Mm-hmm. Hm-hmm. Hm-hmm.

33:07.160 --> 33:09.560
-How's your soup?
-Um-hmm. It's cold.

33:09.640 --> 33:11.480
It's cold, Rahim.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.480
Hmm.

33:17.040 --> 33:18.520
Have you eaten here before?

33:19.280 --> 33:23.280
Um, my mum and dad came here
for their wedding anniversary, so...

33:24.280 --> 33:26.600
I thought it would be nice.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.640
Let's go somewhere else.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.320
-Where?
-Take me where you feel happy.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.800
Uh, but... Well, we haven't paid.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.040
Who cares?

33:38.120 --> 33:39.520
You cannot live in fear.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.640
- Oi!
- Huh? Yes, yeah.

33:49.480 --> 33:51.600
This is for you, that is from me.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.200
So, you just run the scanner
over the barcode, like so.

34:09.800 --> 34:10.920
-Ah.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.560
Jessie's a rescue.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.400
-She's not trained, so don't let her out.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.800
She'll just run off.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.040
Okay. You show me now.

34:37.720 --> 34:39.760
No way.
I'm not doing that, I'm really not.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.840
No, Rahim, come on, it'll be fun.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.120
No, I'm very bad at dancing.
I'm not doing that.

34:44.840 --> 34:48.120
Look, you said take you somewhere
that makes me feel happy.

34:50.040 --> 34:50.960
Do it for me?

34:53.160 --> 34:55.040

35:45.800 --> 35:47.680
-That was fun.
-No, you smashed it.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.520
Honestly, you smashed it, Rahim, watch--

36:02.840 --> 36:04.080
You just kissed me.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.200
Yes, Eric Effiong, I did.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.120
Let's do this dance thing again,
all right?

36:09.560 --> 36:10.480
Yeah?

36:11.440 --> 36:13.280

36:38.080 --> 36:39.000

36:56.880 --> 36:58.080
Yes.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.160
It's sexy here, right?
I live above a shop.

37:17.080 --> 37:18.240
When did you get back?

37:18.720 --> 37:20.400
None of your business, Tromboner.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.160
Do you guys know each other?

37:25.120 --> 37:27.120
We used to go to school together.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.840
Um... Do you know what?

37:30.800 --> 37:31.680
Um...

37:32.200 --> 37:36.520
it's a bit late,
and I need to get home, sorry.

37:37.120 --> 37:38.080
Okay.

37:38.640 --> 37:40.240
-You can see it another time.
-Mm-hmm.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.120
Thank you for a beautiful night.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.760
Oh, sorry.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.080
Okay.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.040
Bye.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.120
Jackson?

38:21.520 --> 38:23.040
Is this where you live?

38:23.640 --> 38:25.000
Yeah, this is me.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.000
It's nice.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.000
You'll let me know
when I can have my jeans back?

38:32.080 --> 38:34.400
Absolutely. Thanks, Aimee.

38:36.120 --> 38:37.840
Sorry for ruining your birthday.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.360
Weirdly, one of the best birthdays
I've had in a long time.

38:42.640 --> 38:45.200
-All right, bye!
- Bye.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.960
- Aimee-maimee!
-Night, Mum!

38:59.040 --> 39:01.000
No, no, how was your day?

39:01.080 --> 39:03.680
Come in! Come in.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.480
Come in and talk to me.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.320
Oh, why are you wearing those trousers?

39:09.800 --> 39:11.120
They're not flattering at all.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.960
'Cause I lost my jeans.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.240
How did you lose your jeans?

39:17.920 --> 39:19.480
Well, I was on the bus...

39:23.080 --> 39:25.280
and actually, I'm not really sure.

39:25.360 --> 39:29.240
What about I make you a cheese toastie?
And you can fill me in on all the goss.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.880
I always like to know
who's kissing who, and--

39:31.960 --> 39:32.880
I'm quite tired.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.760
Oh. What about we watch a movie?

39:35.880 --> 39:39.000
You know, something with,
um, Ryan Gosling.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.240
He's so handsome.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.840
Or is it Ryan Reynolds?

39:43.280 --> 39:44.520
Which Ryan do I like?

39:45.280 --> 39:46.320
Gosling.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.040
-I think I'm gonna go to bed.
-Oh.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.320

What happened to your face?

41:05.440 --> 41:08.120
I told him I had other kids.
It didn't go down too well.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.200
Have.

41:11.240 --> 41:12.400
You have other kids.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.640
You're saving my life, Froggy.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.880
Yeah, you can come in, but we're not
gonna pretend everything's okay,

41:20.320 --> 41:21.400
'cause it's not.

41:22.560 --> 41:23.480
Got it.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.040
Come on, darling.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.640
I came to apologize to your dad.

42:06.800 --> 42:07.720
Hmm.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.000
Okay. I'll go get him.

42:15.600 --> 42:17.200
- Dad...
-Mm-hmm.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.160
He just wants to talk to you.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.000
My mum wanted me to come and apologize.

42:28.760 --> 42:29.880
So, I'm sorry.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.920
Well, there's no need to,

42:33.920 --> 42:35.000
but thanks.

42:38.360 --> 42:39.520
I already have a dad.

42:40.760 --> 42:41.680
I understand that.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.120
It's all right.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.840
Hey, you ready for school?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.560
Yep. I guess.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.880
Thank you. You have a good day now.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.760
-See you, Dad.
-Bye-bye.

43:13.640 --> 43:14.880
Everything all right?

43:15.840 --> 43:17.040
Sorry, wrong bus.

43:34.960 --> 43:40.080
"Oh, Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?

43:41.240 --> 43:46.560

and I'll no longer be a Capulet."

43:48.120 --> 43:50.280
Okay. Thank you, Florence.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.320
I haven't got to the good bit yet.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.680
Juliet thinks she's in love
and then she dies. We get the gist.

43:59.080 --> 43:59.960
Next.

44:01.680 --> 44:02.720
Ahh!

44:03.320 --> 44:04.240
Jackson!

44:05.120 --> 44:07.600
This is gonna be a train wreck.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.680
Uh, please...

44:33.480 --> 44:35.040
I think we've found our Romeo.

44:35.120 --> 44:36.240
...is sick and green.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.360
And none but fools do wear it.

44:39.200 --> 44:40.440
Cast it off."

44:43.560 --> 44:46.720
-How was the family dinner?
-Oh, God, disastrous.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.360
How did your date go?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.080
We... kissed.

44:52.320 --> 44:54.680
-You kissed?
-We kissed, man!

44:54.760 --> 44:55.960
-Actually?
-How sick is that?

44:56.040 --> 44:59.320
-Yes! We kissed!
-Oh, Eric.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.000
Can I walk you to lunch?

45:02.080 --> 45:03.880
Yes. Yes.

45:04.520 --> 45:06.440
-Yeah.
-Okay.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.480
Hmm.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.320
Hey.

45:22.760 --> 45:23.600
Hi.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.920
-Maybe your mum is gonna be a problem.
-Yup.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.520
How was the rest of your birthday?

45:32.320 --> 45:33.440
Unexpected.

45:34.240 --> 45:35.080
Well...

45:35.920 --> 45:37.800
I got you something.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.440
-You got me a five-year diary?
-Mm-hmm.

45:43.520 --> 45:47.960
And I ripped out all your birthday pages,

45:48.400 --> 45:51.160
so you don't have to celebrate one
for another five years.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.160
-Thank you.
-That's all right.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.040
Um...

45:59.960 --> 46:00.840
see you later.

46:04.440 --> 46:05.280
Otis...

46:09.160 --> 46:10.440
uh, I think...

46:13.240 --> 46:14.160
I think...

46:15.720 --> 46:16.600
