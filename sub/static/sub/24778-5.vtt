WEBVTT

00:06.574 --> 00:09.210
- Previously on "Colony."

00:10.444 --> 00:10.478
- A Marine buddy I ran with
thought he knew a guy here.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.046
Had to be the only jarhead
in the world

00:12.680 --> 00:13.514
with a Bugs Bunny tattoo.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.249
You know him?

00:15.283 --> 00:16.284
- I'm sorry, I don't.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.252
- We lost him.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.653
- A raid.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.422
It went bad.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.158
- We can claim a true victory
for the resistance

00:24.192 --> 00:25.626
by destroying it.

00:25.659 --> 00:28.262
- What's happening right now,
you know it's wrong.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.531
- Lower your weapon unless
you're willing to die

00:30.564 --> 00:32.100
for a couple of strangers.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.569
Take them to the brig.

00:35.603 --> 00:42.610
*

00:55.589 --> 00:57.658
*

01:00.261 --> 01:07.268
*

01:12.340 --> 01:19.347
*

01:38.632 --> 01:41.101
- Everyone's dead.

01:47.508 --> 01:51.179
It seems like things were going
according to plan from my team.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.546
We got into position.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.115
Hit the detonator
at the right moment.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.686
I don't know how they
responded that fast.

02:03.291 --> 02:10.231
*

02:19.473 --> 02:20.774
- You made it.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.277
- Yeah.

02:23.311 --> 02:24.712
But just me.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.247
- Is that...

02:26.280 --> 02:27.581
*

02:27.615 --> 02:30.584
Holy shit.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.787
Is it still working?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.525
*

02:37.558 --> 02:38.659
- We did it.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.294
*

02:40.328 --> 02:42.263
- Yeah.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.432
- You abandoned us.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.368
You're a coward.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.670
- I ran into a patrol.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.539
- There was no patrol.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.274
You got scared.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.544
- Yeah, I'm calling you a liar!

02:56.577 --> 02:58.246
Soon the whole
camp's gonna know.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.649
- My plan worked.
I'm sorry about the men.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.684
But the mission was successful.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
This is a great day
in the struggle.

03:05.386 --> 03:11.292
*

03:11.325 --> 03:12.560
- Easy.

03:12.593 --> 03:17.798
*

03:17.831 --> 03:19.400
Easy.

03:19.433 --> 03:26.440
*

03:32.313 --> 03:36.584
- Hey, you can't sit
on the fence anymore.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.452
You have to make a choice.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.789
You can follow that guy
and win a couple of battles.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.726
Or you can follow me
and win the war.

03:52.733 --> 03:57.638
*

04:18.392 --> 04:20.394
This is good.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.272
Want a drink?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.486
- I just wanted to talk
to the Click.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.692
- There's no such thing
as a small betrayal.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.729
- I thought it was a mistake
not to interrogate that thing

04:55.763 --> 04:57.465
now that we could
finally talk to it.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.700
- So you sided with
a bunch of strangers.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.702
- That's not fair.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.304
I've always taken your side.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.459
- I need to expose the truth.

05:27.761 --> 05:31.565
And I value your skills
as an interrogator.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.335
I think the Bowmans
trust you, too.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.873
- Do you really think
the Bowmans are double agents?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.775
- They're the tip of the spear.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.612
The first piece in
an insidious plot to destroy

05:44.645 --> 05:47.581
the last remaining human
Resistance from the inside.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.918
- Katie Bowman was a hero
in the Los Angeles bloc.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
Benedict Arnold was one
of George Washington's

05:54.755 --> 05:57.591
most trusted lieutenants
until he flipped sides.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.827
- Andrew, if they're
double agents,

05:59.860 --> 06:01.629
why would they bring
us the gauntlet?

06:01.662 --> 06:04.498
- To buy their way inside.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.733
- Okay, but I don't understand.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.469
Why would the Occupation
take that risk?

06:08.502 --> 06:09.903
They could have sent us
a fake gauntlet--

06:09.937 --> 06:11.739
one that didn't interface
with the Click--

06:11.772 --> 06:13.641
And we never would have
known the difference.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.480
- Why are you defending
a pack of traitors?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.652
- Because if I'm gonna
interrogate them,

06:24.685 --> 06:26.754
I need to understand
their logic.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.590
So I know what thread to follow
with the questions.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.829
- It's because they're
playing the long game.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.734
Other Resistance groups,
they look to us

06:40.768 --> 06:43.003
for guidance and support.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.039
If the Occupation destroy us,
well, we're just martyrs.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.609
But what if we start
telling people that, well,

06:48.642 --> 06:49.977
we don't need to be
fighting the Clicks

06:50.010 --> 06:51.979
because there is something
much worse coming?

06:52.012 --> 06:54.047
- It's a misinformation
campaign.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.784
- And it's a brilliant one.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.520
They don't wanna just stamp out
this little piece of Rebellion.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.955
They want to demoralize
our whole species.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.628
- We turn the tables on them.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.600
You're gonna prove
your loyalty to me

07:12.633 --> 07:14.468
by breaking this family.

07:17.538 --> 07:21.008
The wife is the kind to push
back against authority,

07:21.041 --> 07:24.578
so, uh, you should
start with her.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.949
- I'm gonna have a little chat
with the children.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.913
It's been an eventful few days.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.716
And I know that some of you
are feeling anxious.

08:02.750 --> 08:06.854
But we are on the cusp
of achieving great things.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.023
So keep the faith.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.627
Trust in the process.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.773
- Leave us.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.018
- I thought you might be dead.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.053
- Not yet.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.895
- He never forgives.

08:47.928 --> 08:51.531
But we have a history.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.869
How are you?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.040
- I had no choice.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.109
We all would have died
in that tent.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.944
- Maybe.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.879
You also lost faith in us.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
- Because your story
didn't add up.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.817
- I wanna help you.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.652
But I need to know the truth.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.153
- You wanna know
if I was a collaborator?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.989
- I wanna know
how you survived.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.658
Your husband was
law enforcement.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.926
Those people were culled
after the Arrival.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.728
- We took another name.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.929
The Sullivans.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.864
Will worked in a garage.
I ran a bar.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.667
We kept our heads down.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.703
- Joining the Resistance isn't
exactly keeping your head down.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.109
- I felt like I didn't
have a choice.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.680
Most people couldn't see it.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.882
Everything was
so weirdly normal.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.954
But I knew something terrible
was right around the corner.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.893
- He was more cautious.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.162
We fought a lot.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.997
And he was right.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.833
We were risking everything.

09:59.867 --> 10:01.769
- How did you get out
of Los Angeles?

10:03.136 --> 10:06.874
- When Total Rendition began,
it was chaos.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.942
Broussard knew we had
to get the gauntlet out.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.214
So we staged a diversion.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.816
I assume he's dead,

10:15.849 --> 10:17.885
along with the rest
of his people.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.729
- Believe me when I say this.

10:28.762 --> 10:31.031
I really hope your
story holds up.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.142
- Being questioned.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.744
By MacGregor.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.713
*

10:45.746 --> 10:48.015
- Is that what
the Resistance does now?

10:48.048 --> 10:55.055
*

10:59.126 --> 11:02.129
- Well, he married our aunt.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.097
- He's kind of sad.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.900
Mom says that she took him in
like a stray cat.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.102
Where did he live?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.738
- In our house.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.240
- No, I mean,
which bedroom?

11:13.273 --> 11:15.242
- Well, he stayed--
- No, not you.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.710
Her.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.779
- He stayed in Charlie's room.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.281
Before he got back.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.793
From where?

11:32.826 --> 11:34.094
- The Green Zone.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.896
They made me work up there.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.269
- Assistant proxy's son.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.339
He wanted a friend and so they
made me live up in his house.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.175
- Uh-huh.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.811
*

11:50.844 --> 11:51.979
You're lying.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.981
*

11:54.014 --> 11:55.883
- I'm not.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.753
*

11:59.787 --> 12:02.122
- Do you know what happens
to little boys who lie?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.030
- Yeah.

12:11.999 --> 12:18.271
*

12:18.305 --> 12:20.140
Talk.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.842
- Leave him alone!

12:21.875 --> 12:23.276
- Tell me where your brother
came back from,

12:23.310 --> 12:26.079
and then I'll stop.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.380
*

12:27.414 --> 12:30.884
Tell me,
and then I'll stop.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.955
- Santa Monica.

12:34.988 --> 12:40.393
*

12:43.997 --> 12:47.134
- You were a cop in Los Angeles
before the Arrival?

12:47.167 --> 12:48.902
- That's right.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.805
- They eliminated all the cops.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.173
How'd you stay off their list?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.409
- Another family,
the Sullivans,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.778
were on vacation
during the Arrival.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.115
We took over the house,
their identities.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.357
- Once the initial chaos ended,
the Occupation didn't care.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.392
They just needed bodies.

13:16.063 --> 13:20.133
- You, uh, got a job
as a mechanic?

13:20.167 --> 13:21.902
- That's right.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.336
- And you and your whole family
lived together

13:23.370 --> 13:25.906
in the same house?

13:27.474 --> 13:31.211
- Your whole family were
living together in Los Angeles?

13:33.981 --> 13:35.849
- Except for Charlie.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.018
He was in Santa Monica.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.059
- How did your son end up
in Santa Monica?

13:47.961 --> 13:50.063
- He was trapped over there
when the walls came down.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.335
- Charlie admitted that he
hadn't been living with you,

13:55.368 --> 13:58.171
but he said that he was up
in the Green Zone.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.272
- I told him to lie.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.912
I paid a guy to smuggle me
through the gateway

14:04.945 --> 14:06.947
into Santa Monica.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.016
Then we climbed over
the wall to get back.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.317
If the Occupation found out,

14:10.350 --> 14:12.152
we all would have gone
to the Factory.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.888
- You never climbed the wall
with a 12-year-old kid.

14:17.925 --> 14:20.260
- We were caught on
the ascent by a drone.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.932
Vaporized an old
friend of mine.

14:27.334 --> 14:30.070
- That was a big risk to take.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.272
- You must not have kids.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.407
I would have done anything
to get him back.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.212
- That's what worries me.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.982
What do you mean
when you said

14:42.015 --> 14:44.251
you would have done anything?

14:44.284 --> 14:47.120
- I think the Occupation
promised to bring your kid back

14:47.154 --> 14:48.455
if you worked for them.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.024
- Make up whatever
story you want.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.927
That's not what happened.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.966
- I told you not to interrupt.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.200
- I know.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.401
But it's important.

15:01.434 --> 15:08.408
*

15:08.441 --> 15:10.477
- What do you mean,
the blast caps disappeared?

15:10.510 --> 15:13.046
- We were doing a final check
before the operation.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.481
They're gone.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.283
- Well, they didn't just walk
off on their own.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.951
Somebody must have taken them.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.420
- Maybe it was the missing
Bowman kid.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.355
- We need those blast caps.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.291
Or it won't only be the Bowmans
who are held accountable.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.526
- Interrogation is
an iterative process,

15:26.559 --> 15:28.028
and we're making headway.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.062
- It's too slow.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.299
- Look, I can crack them.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.167
But you gotta give me
space to operate.

15:34.201 --> 15:36.203
You tipped off Will
about Santa Monica.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.571
That's how he wiggled
off the hook.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.408
*

15:41.441 --> 15:44.044
They don't know what we know.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.347
Or what the others
might have given up.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.482
I can take advantage of that.

15:52.219 --> 15:54.254
- We'll try it your way.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.423
But I'm running
out of patience.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.441
- What did Will do
in Los Angeles?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.411
- He was a mechanic.
- That's interesting.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.015
Because he just told us that
he worked for the Occupation.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.556
I know why you tried
to cover it up.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.759
But now you need
to help me understand

16:32.792 --> 16:35.128
so I can help you.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.072
- We had no choice.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.074
- I get it.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.808
You were under pressure.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.044
Charlie was in Santa Monica.

16:53.780 --> 16:58.685
- N--No, Will didn't take that
job just to get Charlie back.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.553
He was working on the inside.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.489
For me and for Broussard.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.557
- I could smell it the moment
I met you and your husband.

17:04.591 --> 17:06.093
You were collaborators.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.560
- We would never have
gotten the gauntlet

17:07.594 --> 17:08.828
without Will's information
and connections.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.797
We needed a source
on the inside.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.232
That's how this work is done.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.800
- I know how
this work is done.

17:13.833 --> 17:16.636
But if you were
who you said you were,

17:16.669 --> 17:19.506
why would you need to lie?

17:19.539 --> 17:22.509
- Because we didn't
feel safe here.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.111
- Well, that's odd.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.845
Why would a genuine member
of the Resistance

17:25.878 --> 17:28.615
not feel safe
among the Resistance?

17:28.648 --> 17:32.585
- Because he warned us that
this camp was political.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.787
You don't know what it's like
to live in the blocs.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.190
Always under the nose
of the Occupation.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.259
- Why is it so difficult
to pick up a gun and fight?

17:40.827 --> 17:42.529
When your children
are on the line?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.131
- So you admit it.
That's how they got to you.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.565
Through your children.
- They never got to me!

17:45.598 --> 17:47.500
- Well, they got
to your husband.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.802
He sold himself to bring your
son back from Santa Monica.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.739
Now, tell me exactly
how many innocent people

17:52.772 --> 17:53.873
did he send to the Factory?

17:56.676 --> 17:57.877
What the hell is that?

18:08.855 --> 18:15.862
*

18:16.863 --> 18:19.566
- Traitor!

18:29.742 --> 18:31.711
- Look who I found.

18:31.744 --> 18:36.316
*

18:37.750 --> 18:44.757
*

18:47.960 --> 18:50.530
- You stole my detonators.

18:50.563 --> 18:51.631
- Yeah.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.867
*

18:56.636 --> 18:58.938
- If you kill me,
you'll never find them.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.307
- Bram.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.642
- We just wanna get
out of the camp.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.680
- This isn't a negotiation.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.216
- Just tell him, Bram.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.750
- And then we'll have
no leverage.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.753
- Wait, let me talk to him.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.688
Let me talk to him!
- Please, please.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.956
Talk.
- Let me talk to him.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.759
Don't let him do this.
Vincent!

19:19.792 --> 19:22.362
I can talk to him.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.365
- Jesus!

19:25.398 --> 19:26.733
Son of a bitch!

19:28.701 --> 19:30.370
*

19:30.403 --> 19:33.973
Wait, wait!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.942
I've got something to trade.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.877
Information.
A gold mine.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.646
We'll give you that
and the detonators

19:39.679 --> 19:41.748
for safe passage out of here.

19:41.781 --> 19:46.853
*

19:48.355 --> 19:51.258
- High level.
Straight from the IGA.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.925
- Don't do it, Dad.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.729
- Stop, stop!

19:56.763 --> 19:58.765
- Stop.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.602
I need your word.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.003
- Well, you're not getting it.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.274
Not until you tell me exactly
what you have to trade.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.609
*

20:09.642 --> 20:10.977
What?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.945
What, you think we're gonna
stop with this?

20:12.979 --> 20:14.647
Once we're done with your son,

20:14.681 --> 20:16.249
we're gonna start
on your little girl.

20:16.283 --> 20:23.290
*

20:33.333 --> 20:35.402
- The man traveling with us.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.607
His real name is Alan Snyder.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.919
- So.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.422
Which one of them
gave me up?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.890
Katie?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.460
- The husband.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.894
- Ah, of course.

21:01.928 --> 21:05.798
Knife to the throat
of his kids, I assume.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.834
And now you're here
to hang me.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.903
- We're here to hold you
accountable for your crimes.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.542
- And what would
those crimes be?

21:15.575 --> 21:18.411
- Genocide, treachery.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.680
- That's not very specific.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.549
- You ran the Los Angeles bloc.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.352
- Yes, where I saved
countless lives.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.355
You'll note that
when I was removed from power,

21:28.388 --> 21:31.558
every man, woman, and child
was shipped off to the Factory.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.560
- By the goddamn Clicks.

21:33.593 --> 21:34.961
Your masters.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.563
The ones who
are systematically

21:36.596 --> 21:37.830
exterminating mankind.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.732
- They're not
exterminating mankind.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.668
That would imply intent.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.836
They're simply using humans
as a labor force,

21:43.870 --> 21:46.406
and a lot of us are dying
in the process.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.541
- Of course it does.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.577
I wish they had
never come here.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.945
But they did,
so I worked to save

21:52.979 --> 21:55.715
as many people as possible.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.450
- Then why did you
leave the bloc?

21:57.484 --> 21:58.885
- Because of the other humans.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.853
Occupation hierarchy's
a snake pit.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.722
Make one mistake,
and you're dead.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.525
So I figured that I'd
get out while I could.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.660
- How heroic.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.429
- Well, I'm not a brave man.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.630
But I am a smart man.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.599
And if you were smart,

22:12.632 --> 22:16.536
you'd bunker down and try
to survive the coming war.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.941
- The war between our hosts
and something much, much worse.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.711
This nonsense again.
- It's not nonsense.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.012
We mean nothing to either side,

22:26.045 --> 22:28.415
but we're still
in the line of fire.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.516
- So what are we
supposed to do?

22:29.549 --> 22:30.917
- Stay alive.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.952
Which is why you need
to give back that Host.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.787
- I'll do what I want
with my Click.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.022
- Of course.
I'm just suggesting

22:36.055 --> 22:37.890
you should weigh
the consequences.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.959
If you destroy that thing,
they're going to retaliate.

22:42.995 --> 22:46.499
- Oh, so you've heard about
what happened to Dallas?

22:46.533 --> 22:47.967
- Another Click war crime.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.802
- Call it whatever you want.

22:49.836 --> 22:52.639
But the fact is that two
of our Hosts were destroyed

22:52.672 --> 22:55.908
after a human Resistance group
set off a massive EMP,

22:55.942 --> 22:58.511
so they fired a weapon
from space.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.980
I'm told that the sand
literally turned to glass

23:01.013 --> 23:02.815
for hundreds of miles
in every direction.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.651
Not even
the cockroaches survived.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.654
*

23:07.687 --> 23:09.589
I don't care what
choices you make.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.959
Resist, collaborate,
fight, or hide.

23:12.992 --> 23:16.563
But before you lecture me on
the importance of human life,

23:16.596 --> 23:19.466
ask yourself why you're
going to make the choice

23:19.499 --> 23:21.934
to kill millions of people.

23:21.968 --> 23:25.672
Nothing will change.
Nobody will be inspired.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.774
They'll just be dead.

23:27.807 --> 23:32.078
*

23:34.046 --> 23:39.085
*

23:42.722 --> 23:45.057
- I greatly appreciated the
symbolism of sending the Click

23:45.091 --> 23:46.559
with the bomb to Seattle.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.861
But we have to destroy it, now.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.563
- Didn't you hear
what he just said?

23:50.597 --> 23:51.831
About Dallas?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.533
- I didn't believe
a word of that.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.935
It's all part
of their mind games.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.772
- But what if it's--

23:59.806 --> 24:01.908
- Just listen to yourself.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.544
We set out to liberate
ourselves from the Clicks,

24:04.577 --> 24:07.980
and you are too afraid to kill
even a single one of them.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.883
That thing is making us
question ourselves.

24:10.917 --> 24:14.687
Hell, it even got you
to pick up a gun against me.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.889
It's time to cross
the Rubicon.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.560
Take a leap of faith.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.496
Unless, of course, you don't
believe in what we're doing.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.035
- Okay.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.003
- Arrange the demolition.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.540
I'm gonna prepare
my remarks for the camp.

24:33.573 --> 24:40.580
*

24:46.619 --> 24:49.055
- The commander has ordered us
to destroy the Click.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.092
Go to the arsenal and get
four Claymore mines.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.996
We'll rig them
to blow simultaneously.

24:57.029 --> 25:04.036
*

25:20.987 --> 25:24.724
We're gonna kill you.
Do you understand?

25:24.757 --> 25:31.964
*

25:35.001 --> 25:41.107
*

25:41.140 --> 25:42.942
What happened in Dallas?

25:42.975 --> 25:45.912
*

26:13.773 --> 26:15.942
- We shouldn't have killed him.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.978
Bugs was a good man.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.180
And I shot him in the back.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.715
Like a coward.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.250
- What does it matter
how you killed him?

26:24.283 --> 26:26.653
This isn't the wild west.
It's war.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.792
- Aren't you worried that
we're eating ourselves?

26:32.825 --> 26:35.327
First Bugs,
now the Bowman family?

26:35.361 --> 26:37.897
We're supposed to be
on the same side.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.866
- Study history.

26:39.899 --> 26:43.302
Revolutions only succeed
by remaining pure.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.873
Because the human brain
is utterly incapable

26:46.906 --> 26:50.009
of being both nuanced and
passionate at the same time.

26:50.042 --> 26:53.345
Either we pull together
in the same direction,

26:53.379 --> 26:54.914
or we fall apart.

26:57.249 --> 27:00.820
- You know why I followed
you and not Bugs?

27:00.853 --> 27:02.755
Because you never
second-guess yourself.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.623
- That's the price
of leadership.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.636
I know you're a different
kind of man.

27:18.070 --> 27:21.307
I respect your ability
to see the gray areas.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.443
But this is not
the war for that.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.050
What if we've forgotten
who we are?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.955
The future generations will
judge us for what we have done.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.424
But at least they'll
be alive to judge.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.804
Stop.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.410
I have indulged your
questions so far

27:58.444 --> 27:59.979
because I value your support.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.381
But that is done.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.717
From now on,
you need to be a soldier.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.371
- Our Click can't communicate
with the Occupation,

28:25.404 --> 28:26.906
otherwise they would have
stormed the camp.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.407
- Correct.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.109
- Then how are they gonna know
if we blow it up?

28:30.142 --> 28:32.344
- Does your commander seem
like the kind of man

28:32.378 --> 28:33.913
to keep that secret?

28:45.524 --> 28:47.026
It's a machine, right?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.861
- Also correct.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.396
- Then why do they care so much
if it's destroyed?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.031
Can't they just
make another one?

28:52.064 --> 28:56.068
- That glowing ball thing
in the suit's helmet,

28:56.102 --> 28:58.137
it's a kind of consciousness.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.041
What does that mean?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.010
- I don't know exactly.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.779
Maybe they used to have
actual bodies

29:06.813 --> 29:08.480
and uploaded themselves
into the sphere.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.549
Maybe they were created
by another species.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.384
The important thing is,

29:12.418 --> 29:15.955
there are only a few hundred
of those glowing balls.

29:15.988 --> 29:19.826
- Everything else, the drones,
the walkers, the ships--

29:19.859 --> 29:22.028
- Automated.
Pieces of a hive mind.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.530
They get irritated
when you destroy a drone.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.999
It's a resource that
they have to replace.

29:28.367 --> 29:32.404
But when you go after
one of those cores...

29:37.043 --> 29:39.846
- I can tell that
you're a good man.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.448
Trying to make
the right decision.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.553
- No.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.121
- Because I'm a pragmatist.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.157
- Sometimes pragmatists
do terrible things.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.459
- So do good men.
But that's not the point.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.028
In this case,
my pragmatism

29:56.062 --> 29:58.965
and your morality
are on the same side.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.533
- Would a moral man
betray his friends?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.835
His commander?

30:02.869 --> 30:05.204
- To stop an unspeakable
tragedy?

30:05.237 --> 30:06.906
Of course.

30:10.977 --> 30:15.047
You can save every
man, woman, and child

30:15.081 --> 30:17.016
in the Pacific Northwest.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.418
It's in your hands.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.222
- MacGreggor won't
listen to me.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.858
And I don't have enough support
in the camp to stop him

30:25.892 --> 30:27.093
from destroying the Click.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.862
- Then you need reinforcements.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.248
How?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.083
- You call a certain
radio frequency

30:51.117 --> 30:52.551
and say a code word.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.453
- The moment I do that,
I'll give us away.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.155
They'll trace the signal
right back to the camp.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.490
- Not if you keep the
transmission under six seconds.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.027
*

31:02.094 --> 31:03.629
- Wait for a response.

31:03.662 --> 31:04.663
They'll call you back
on the same frequency

31:04.696 --> 31:06.198
and offer terms.

31:06.232 --> 31:09.235
If the terms are acceptable,
you respond.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.505
- It depends what you want.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.642
Maybe you ask for amnesty
for everyone in this camp.

31:16.675 --> 31:20.546
Maybe you demand a spectacular
chalet in the Swiss Alps.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.050
It's up to you.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.551
I've been in your position,

31:25.584 --> 31:28.554
when it feels like there
are no good options.

31:28.587 --> 31:32.124
But sometimes you just have
to be the man

31:32.158 --> 31:34.160
who stands in front
of the train.

31:34.193 --> 31:41.200
*

31:57.083 --> 31:58.317
- Get him out.

31:58.350 --> 32:05.491
*

32:32.118 --> 32:33.352
- Roanoke.

32:33.385 --> 32:36.222
*

32:38.257 --> 32:44.997
*

32:49.035 --> 32:56.042
*

33:01.047 --> 33:03.115
- I remembered who I was.

33:03.149 --> 33:10.156
*

33:28.740 --> 33:29.408
- You are a double agent.
- That is not true.

33:29.975 --> 33:31.043
- You are a double agent

33:31.843 --> 33:32.744
traveling with
a known collaborator.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.647
Your presence in this camp
has caused nothing but unrest,

33:35.681 --> 33:38.050
and this must stop.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.386
I thereby sentence you
and your husband to death.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.794
- Your eldest son is
old enough to be accountable

33:48.827 --> 33:51.097
for his actions,
and he will share your fate.

33:51.130 --> 33:53.232
The two younger ones will stay
here until they're old enough

33:53.265 --> 33:54.733
to survive on their own.

33:54.766 --> 33:56.768
Take her, the husband,
and the eldest son

33:56.802 --> 33:58.070
to the rifle range.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.674
- I'm not done with him yet.

34:10.382 --> 34:13.385
- Ah.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.421
Do you have another one?

34:36.475 --> 34:40.246
You breathe too loud.
It's distracting.

34:46.885 --> 34:51.523
*

34:51.557 --> 34:53.692
Will...

34:54.860 --> 34:56.428
- Did you know that--

34:57.463 --> 34:59.798
- Get up.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.100
- Get up.
Move.

35:05.937 --> 35:11.810
*

35:11.843 --> 35:14.546
- No, get off me!
No!

35:14.580 --> 35:21.753
*

35:27.326 --> 35:34.333
*

36:01.493 --> 36:04.463
[screeching stops,
high

36:07.366 --> 36:08.434
- Help!

36:09.468 --> 36:10.469
Let us out!

36:12.938 --> 36:15.474
- Get to the woods.
Out the back.

36:18.577 --> 36:19.978
Go!
- This way!

36:23.249 --> 36:24.616
*

36:30.389 --> 36:37.396
*

36:42.368 --> 36:43.469
- Hey, you're okay.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.470
You're okay.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.505
- It hurts.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.447
Will, the kids.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.451
Will.
- Let's go.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.566
Let's move.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.278
The woods.
They'd go to the woods.

37:32.984 --> 37:33.952
Come on, come on.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.554
Go, go.

37:39.057 --> 37:41.059
Charlie!

37:41.092 --> 37:43.329
- Charlie!
- Gracie!

37:43.362 --> 37:45.331
Charlie!

37:45.364 --> 37:46.598
- Come on. Come on.

37:54.973 --> 37:58.610
*

37:58.644 --> 38:01.447
- Hey, we gotta go that way.
Okay?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.915
Run.
As fast as you can.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.044
- There she is.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.682
Gracie!

38:37.649 --> 38:39.050
- Come here, baby!

38:42.654 --> 38:44.356
I got you.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.029
- Charlie!

38:51.062 --> 38:53.532
Charlie!
- Bram, she's hurt!

38:53.565 --> 38:55.701
- Charlie, run!

39:05.411 --> 39:07.646
- Charlie!

39:07.679 --> 39:10.048
Charlie!

39:14.820 --> 39:16.622
- Charlie!

39:16.655 --> 39:18.590
No!
No!

39:18.624 --> 39:20.058
- No, no!
- Charlie!

39:20.091 --> 39:21.693
- No! No!
- Charlie!

39:21.727 --> 39:23.462
- Gracie's hurt!
We have to go!

39:23.495 --> 39:24.796
- No, no!
- We have to go!

39:24.830 --> 39:26.665
- No, my baby!
- We have to go!

39:26.698 --> 39:27.799
- Now!
- Now!

39:27.833 --> 39:29.601
- Come on!
- Now

39:29.635 --> 39:30.802
- Now!

39:30.836 --> 39:33.572
- Come on, Gracie.

40:01.567 --> 40:01.967
- Mr. Snyder.

40:04.670 --> 40:07.105
- Lieutenant Garland.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.207
You gonna hit me in
the face again

40:09.240 --> 40:11.109
- Well, it did seem
like it worked.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.011
You bought your way inside.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.613
Although that, uh,
that didn't sound

40:14.646 --> 40:16.147
like your voice
on the radio.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.916
- It wasn't.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.619
- So, how'd you get them
to give up their position?

40:20.652 --> 40:22.654
- I kept hammering
at the weak link

40:22.688 --> 40:24.523
until it finally broke.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.194
You know, I've never met
a man who could have

40:29.227 --> 40:30.929
anything he wants before.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.466
- Trust me,
I've never been that man.

40:36.234 --> 40:39.905
- To the center of the action.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.640
- I've always wanted
to see the Alps.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.209
Maybe reconnect
with some old friends.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.980
- You know, I didn't think
you'd actually get it done.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.550
You surprised me.
- I get that a lot.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.219
- Next chopper leaves
in 20 minutes.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.555
- You couldn't get me out
of this hell hole fast enough.

40:56.588 --> 40:59.124
- I'm sure, but I need you
to do something for me first.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.233
*

41:10.936 --> 41:12.638
Control wants to confirm
that he's dead.

41:12.671 --> 41:19.244
*

41:19.277 --> 41:22.147
- That one.

41:22.180 --> 41:24.282
Did you kill everyone?

41:24.315 --> 41:26.117
- Most of them.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.621
Are you gonna chase them?

41:29.655 --> 41:31.523
- No, we got what we needed.

41:31.557 --> 41:33.258
Just let them starve out there.

41:36.294 --> 41:43.501
*

42:11.196 --> 42:13.198
Let's go.

42:13.231 --> 42:20.238
*
