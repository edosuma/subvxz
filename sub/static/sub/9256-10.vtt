00:01.839 --> 00:03.200
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.400 --> 00:05.200
Hooker? Face down
like the other four?

00:05.400 --> 00:07.080
- I warned you.
- You did.

00:07.280 --> 00:09.320
The guy who murdered Sally's
still out there!

00:09.520 --> 00:12.160
We'll get your guy too.
Just won't be today.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.400
- I'm not gay.
- Julien. Come on.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.680
It's this thing inside of me.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.360
I push it down, it goes away.
But then it comes back stronger.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.680
I hate this thing inside of me.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.440
You can't go through life
hating who you are.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.720
I pushed away everyone.
My partner, my reverend, Tomas.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.400
I'm alone.

00:37.360 --> 00:41.320
- Jesus Christ! What happened?
- I thought that he was gonna kill me!

00:41.520 --> 00:45.240
- Well that story's not gonna cut it.
- I'll lose my son.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.280
All right, you had sex.
You asked him to pay.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.080
He said he didn't have to.
He was gonna make you pay.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.200
- Your friends, they'll believe that?
- If you have the bruises to prove it.

00:55.400 --> 00:57.280
Hit me.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.600
- So how am I doing?
- I got no complaints.

01:23.320 --> 01:24.920
You wanna go
someplace more private?

01:26.400 --> 01:28.800
I thought this was as
private as it got in here.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.160
- I mean outside.
- That sounds promising.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.280
We gotta hurry up. I don't want
my boss to catch me.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.280
- How do I know you're not a cop?
- If I were a cop, would I do this?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.600
- That's nice.
- Is he doing what I think he's doing?

01:50.760 --> 01:52.240
No way.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.440
How are we supposed to know when
these muggers jump him?

01:55.600 --> 01:58.560
- We gotta go in.
- And ruin a good thing? He'd kill us.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.120
- Jesus. Just lost my appetite.
- I told you I saw something.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.600
Sir! You wanna stop
jerking off there?

02:09.800 --> 02:12.400
Get your hands out of your pants
and put them up!

02:12.560 --> 02:14.840
- All right, all right!
- Against the wall. Move it.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.440
- I can explain. I can...
- Move it! Up against the wall!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.240
Get his wallet.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.840
- Turn around.
- Long way from Pasadena.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.280
Alleys not good enough
for you there?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.360
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever done.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.960
- Well, we call it a lewd act in public.
- Oh, God.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.800
I guess she wasn't one of the girls
involved with the mugging ring.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.760
Oh, you dog.
You nailed her, didn't you?

02:41.920 --> 02:45.400
- Yeah, like I'd tell you three.
- Oh, no, he was deep undercover.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.360
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.040
Whoa! Calm down, Connie.
What's the matter?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.560
All right, hold on.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.920
Listen, I gotta run. Wait a half-hour
and then send the next guy in.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.080
Rotate until one of you guys
gets attacked.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.360
- Or gets a little tail.
- All right. Where are you now?

03:04.200 --> 03:06.280
Oh, God.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.840
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Christ. Connie, what happened?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.240
She was my mom.

03:17.120 --> 03:20.520
- So tell me, Ronnie.
- He used his own name?

03:20.680 --> 03:23.320
- Amateur.
- Like, what kind of stuff you into?

03:23.480 --> 03:27.320
<i>You know, golf. I'm a 4 handicap.</i>

03:27.520 --> 03:29.560
Is he looking to caddie
or get his junk greased?

03:29.720 --> 03:31.680
Sit right here and relax.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.720
- You like this, Ronnie?
- Yeah.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.400
- Yeah?
- But could you, like, just...

03:37.560 --> 03:39.280
...kind of tease me?
- Tease?

03:39.760 --> 03:44.000
Not really tak e it off,
but, like, almost and then not.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.960
<i>- Oh, okay.
- What, is he for real?</i>

03:46.160 --> 03:48.760
All right, that's it, I'm going in.
That's it.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.360
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.240
What are you gonna do
about him, Connie?

03:54.760 --> 03:56.960
- I'll feed him.
- I mean...

03:57.840 --> 04:00.880
...without your mom,
who's gonna take care of Brian?

04:01.360 --> 04:04.000
- I can take care of him.
- You need help.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.120
I'll get clean.
I won't need help.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.280
- You can barely take care of yourself.
- No.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.200
- Connie...
- Please!

04:15.840 --> 04:18.120
They can't take Brian.
He's all I got left.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.960
My mom...
God, Vic.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.040
My mommy's dead.
Help me, Vic.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.800
- You can get me through it.
- Connie, you need to go somewhere.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.840
Rehab, a treatment centre.

04:39.000 --> 04:45.200
The DA's still looking at my plea.
I'll go into detox, and they'll use that.

04:46.080 --> 04:48.720
I'll lose Brian, and they'll
take my aid!

04:49.640 --> 04:53.840
Okay? It's been, like,
12 hours since I chased.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.040
- Tonight and tomorrow will be worse.
- Connie.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.360
I'm gonna get straight this time.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.280
I have to.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.160
I'm his mom.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.800
Yeah, leave that to me.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.760
- Reporter?
- From La Unidad.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.600
Didn't you know?
Our captain is a Latino to watch.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.080
How about a story
about a lanky white guy to watch?

05:36.240 --> 05:39.480
Since your arrival, there have been
major drops in all areas of crime.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.760
This precinct was an experiment.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.840
But those stats aren't a coincidence.
The Barn is a success.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.280
- The Barn?
- Farmington's called the Farm.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.240
When we moved
into the old church...

05:49.400 --> 05:52.880
...one of the officers nicknamed
the place the Barn. Name stuck.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.160
It's ironic.
Taking over a church.

05:55.320 --> 05:58.520
- God moved out, the cops moved in.
- God's still here. We just sublet.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.400
Mind if I talk to some of your people?

06:01.560 --> 06:04.160
- Get some background?
- Of course not.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.720
Good night for Aceveda
to have a sex-sweep, huh?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.920
Yeah. We busted
a one-armed hooker.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.880
Fifty bucks, she'll let you hump her
in her socket.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.280
Julien and I were in Koreatown, caught
this guy masturbating in the alley.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.480
Wasn't even homeless.
Just a regular Joe from Pasadena.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.560
This guy, you remember
what alley he was in?

06:21.720 --> 06:23.640
Yeah. The one between
Sixth and Wentworth.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.400
Next to the laundromat
that keeps getting hit.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.800
You sure?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.760
Positive.

06:29.920 --> 06:34.560
He's not horning in on your
territory is he, detective?

06:36.240 --> 06:39.040
What was this guy's name?
You remember?

06:39.240 --> 06:41.720
- His name?
- Yeah. It was on the ticket, right?

06:41.880 --> 06:45.200
- We didn't give him one.
- He was a citizen. We just...

06:45.360 --> 06:47.640
...gave him a warning.
Put the scare in him.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.680
Try and remember. What was it?

06:51.840 --> 06:54.000
- Sean, I think.
- Taylor.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.680
- Sean Taylor.
- Yeah, that's it.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.800
- What was that about?
- Who knows? It's Dutch.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.120
If you put yourself or this kid in harm's
way, DCFS isn't gonna take him.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.680
I am. You understand?

07:10.840 --> 07:13.280
I promise, Vic. I promise.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.120
Okay. You should drink a lot of fluids.
Water, juice.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.360
- Your mom got any bananas back here?
- I don't know.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.320
- One of my guys is gonna sit with you.
- Where will you be?

07:24.600 --> 07:28.400
- I'm gonna take Brian away.
- No.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.960
Trust me.
You won't want him to see this.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.120
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.000
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of him.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.720
I love him.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.520
- I really love him.
- I know you do.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.200
- You are so hot.
- Yes, I am.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.680
Am I turning you on?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.240
Well, that's nine inches of yes,
isn't it, darling?

08:04.440 --> 08:08.560
Feels more like 10.
You know, I don't usually do this...

08:08.720 --> 08:11.800
...but do you want to go out back
and finish this off?

08:12.520 --> 08:14.240
All I got is time and money.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.440
- What? I was doing good.
- I'm a 4 handicap?

08:25.640 --> 08:27.440
I was laying the groundwork.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.760
You're killing me, baby.
Oh, let me tak e this thing off.

08:31.920 --> 08:37.080
- Let me tak e this off you right now.
- He shoots, he scores.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.799
- Shit! Shane. Go, go, go!
- Jesus!

08:43.480 --> 08:46.080
- Freeze! Police!
- Back up! Get them up!

08:46.240 --> 08:47.960
Against the wall!

08:48.120 --> 08:50.440
- Hands behind your head!
- Get on your knees!

08:50.600 --> 08:52.160
- Get on your knees!
- Turn around.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.920
Get on your knees!
Shane, are you all right?

08:55.080 --> 08:57.600
Shane!
Can you say anything?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.040
Yes.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.000
Danny.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.880
- Is this the guy you caught jerking off?
- No! I can't go in there. No!

09:09.480 --> 09:12.320
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.880
No! No!

09:15.080 --> 09:17.560
- No, I'm not going in there!
- There you go.

09:17.760 --> 09:20.320
No! No, I'm not going in there!

09:20.560 --> 09:23.440
You should of thought about that
before you solicited a cop.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.080
Hey!

09:26.400 --> 09:27.920
Get off!
Get him off!

09:28.080 --> 09:29.800
He's biting!
Damn it!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.080
Get him off!

09:35.560 --> 09:38.160
Goddamn it! Oh, shit!
Get him off!

09:38.360 --> 09:40.680
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Move!

09:43.760 --> 09:47.600
- You okay?
- Gotta get to the hospital.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.000
- Have them put me on PEP.
- PEP?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.960
Post-exposure prevention,
in case the guy's...

09:53.120 --> 09:56.000
...got HIV.
- You think he does?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.000
You saw the guy.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.520
I was so close to her.
That prick had to come and break it up.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.120
- Dude, let it go, man.
- I'm telling you. It wasn't just an act.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.040
- She really felt something.
- That roll of 20s.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.080
I'm serious. She was rubbing
her ass all over my hands.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.160
They don't just do that
for everyone.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.920
I got a friend who lives in Chicago.
You from there?

10:21.080 --> 10:24.760
- Yeah. Rockford.
- Is that like a suburb?

10:24.920 --> 10:26.840
No. It's its own town.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.280
What are you doing here, detective?

10:29.440 --> 10:32.400
- You should've got a ticket.
- Okay.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.400
- What you did is a misdemeanour.
- Well...

10:35.840 --> 10:38.360
...nobody's more
embarrassed about it than I am.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.280
Hey, we all do it.
You just got caught.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.040
This any good?

10:45.200 --> 10:48.360
That depends on
what you're looking for, detective.

10:48.520 --> 10:51.360
What about the radio?
One in my car only...

10:51.520 --> 10:56.200
...picks up Spanish stations.
- That's not your system. That's L.A.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.960
Well, I guess I'm done here.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.600
- Okay, that's it?
- That's it.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.400
Some husbands
just bring home flowers.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.320
Yeah. I didn't have time
to wrap him up.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.920
- Who is this?
- It's Brian. Connie's kid.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.520
- Connie?
- This hooker. It's a long story.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.840
You brought a prostitute's child home?
Why are you doing this?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.400
Connie's mother died.
A stroke.

11:30.560 --> 11:33.600
- I'm sorry, but that's no...
- She's trying to kick her habit...

11:33.760 --> 11:36.720
...so they won't take him away.
- You expect me to watch him?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.720
It's just for one night.

11:38.920 --> 11:42.920
Look, I'm sorry.
You're the only one I trust him with.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.080
It's okay.
I hate you.

11:46.560 --> 11:50.200
I love you too,
but I gotta go.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.400
Officer, would you see her
to her car, please? Thank you.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.360
- Who's the woman?
- Nobody.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.840
You'd think interviewing so many liars
would make you a better one.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.480
- What?
- We all know you're following up...

12:07.640 --> 12:08.800
...on the self-pleasurer.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.360
The guys started a pool to see
who could come up with the best joke.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.960
- I think he's our serial killer.
- Dutch.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.840
- He killed Sally and the others.
- Got anything this time...

12:18.000 --> 12:23.400
...other than intuition? Like evidence?
- That woman. That's his aunt.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.200
She raised him after his parents died.
His early childhood fits the profile.

12:27.360 --> 12:31.320
- Shy, introverted, a Ioner.
- You're getting colder, not hotter.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.840
He was caught masturbating two blocks
from the corner where Sally worked.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.280
Still cold. You never established
Sally was killed in that alley.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.440
It's the classic
opportunity offender m.o.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.600
They only kill when presented with
the perfect victim at the perfect time.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.520
- And if the opportunity is not perfect?
- Plan B.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.400
Relive the fantasy
at the scene of an earlier crime.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.320
- It's getting chilly.
- Think about it.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.080
The guy has an apartment in Pasadena,
has complete privacy there.

12:56.240 --> 13:00.320
Why is he travelling to one of the worst
parts of town to jerk off in an alley?

13:06.520 --> 13:09.680
- You okay?
- I gotta get out.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.160
- I gotta...
- No. Hey, just lay down.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.560
Just relax. Just relax.
It's okay.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.840
Relax.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.800
- Jesus Christ.
- Connie!

13:20.960 --> 13:22.720
She hit me!

13:23.480 --> 13:27.680
Okay. Okay. All right.
I'm here.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.120
- Okay, okay.
- Vic.

13:31.760 --> 13:35.440
- Vic?
- Here. Try to drink something.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.800
It's water.
Come on. Drink.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.840
Okay, good girl.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.680
Okay.

13:46.400 --> 13:51.200
- I love you, Vic.
- Yeah. Rest.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.440
Okay. Okay, Connie.
Come on. Rest.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.200
- I love you, Vic.
- Yeah.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.120
Rest now. Rest.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.960
- Is your head okay?
- No. It hurts.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.560
I'm sorry about that, you know.
I didn't know you were a cop.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.720
- That was the idea.
- I wanted Carl to stop hitting you...

14:23.960 --> 14:26.880
...because I think you're real cute.
Sexy.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.960
- Southern, right?
- Atlanta, thereabouts.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.000
Hot-lanta.

14:34.680 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.
So tell me about Carl.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.400
He introduced me to the guy
who owns the club...

14:41.560 --> 14:44.280
...and that's when I started, you know.
- Stripping.

14:44.440 --> 14:47.440
Dancing.
I'm a dancer.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.440
- Sorry.
- Then this one night...

14:50.600 --> 14:54.920
...Carl comes to me with this, like,
relevation, asks for my help.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.600
And, you know,
he was getting me my medicine...

14:57.760 --> 15:00.240
...so I kind of felt like I owed him.
I'm epileptic.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.880
Puts you in a tough spot, huh?

15:03.480 --> 15:06.320
I knew it was wrong,
but he was such a sweet guy.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.040
He hit me in the head
with a tire iron.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.160
Yeah, except for that.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.840
Why are you guys harassing me?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.600
- My aunt?
- We just asked her a few questions.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.240
- She's a nice lady.
- Yes.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.280
- Told us about the fire.
- What fire?

15:23.480 --> 15:26.200
The one your parents died in
when you were a kid.

15:26.480 --> 15:30.120
I give your aunt a lot of credit.
It couldn't have been easy raising...

15:30.280 --> 15:33.280
...a child under those circumstances.
- I owe her everything.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.920
You deserve a pat
on the back yourself.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.840
Why?

15:38.040 --> 15:41.400
Well, to be able to lift yourself
above something like that...

15:41.560 --> 15:46.360
...excel in the face of tragedy,
speaks volumes about your character.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.520
- I did the best I could.
- I'd say.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.080
Magna cum laude.
Top 10 in your graduating class.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.160
Turned down a full ride to law school.

15:55.360 --> 15:58.920
- Who wants to be a lawyer, right?
- I hear you.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.880
But it does bring up
an interesting question.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.680
For a guy with such
impressive brain power...

16:05.840 --> 16:08.160
...why install car stereos for a living?

16:15.400 --> 16:20.640
Look. I jerked off in an alley.
Okay?

16:20.800 --> 16:24.640
I'm embarrassed. Now just write me
a ticket and let's be done with this.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.880
Do you like to hunt, Sean?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.280
- Do I like to hunt?
- Mike Joyce.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.160
- Your friend in high school.
- How do you know about Mike?

16:33.360 --> 16:36.000
Talked to a detective
back in Rockford.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.240
Two boys go into the woods deer
hunting. Only one comes back alive.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.400
- It was an accident.
- Maybe.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.000
Or maybe something happened
in those woods.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.480
Or maybe you just have
a very active imagination.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.400
An intelligent,
but underachieving Ioner.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.800
I wonder how you give
your imagination a workout.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.880
I know what you're trying to get at.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.960
And frankly, this whole
psychoanalyzation thing...

17:04.119 --> 17:06.240
...it just seems a bit out of your league.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.720
- Just trying to get to know you better.
- Please.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.960
I know more about you
than you know about me.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.240
- Really?
- He's innocent or doesn't scare easily.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.839
He's the guy.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.480
Well, we better find something fast,
because we can't hold him.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.480
Hey, Dutch. Heard you've been
interviewing the masturbator.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.960
What are you doing,
getting tips?

17:31.600 --> 17:35.200
Goddamn it!
I wanna go home!

17:35.400 --> 17:38.240
Connie. Connie.
You are home, honey.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.160
I wanna die.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.000
I wanna die!

17:46.160 --> 17:50.080
- Connie. Connie! Connie!
- Vic.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.360
That's right, sweetheart. It's me.
It's okay. I'm here. Okay, I'm here.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.560
- I'm here. That's right.
- We had sex.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.000
I told him it was time to pay.
He said he didn't have to pay.

18:00.160 --> 18:03.280
That's when he started
hitting me.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.520
- Man, Connie.
- He pulled out a gun!

18:06.040 --> 18:09.840
- I took it and I shot him!
- What's she saying?

18:10.560 --> 18:14.160
You have to hit me.
Hit me! Come on!

18:14.360 --> 18:17.680
- Connie. Connie.
- Please, Vic.

18:18.440 --> 18:23.760
Please. I wanna die. I wanna die.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.360
- No.
- Yeah.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.600
No, no, you don't. No, you don't.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.960
- Det. Wyms. Tereza Varela.
- Yes, I know.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.560
Have a minute?
People say you're the one to talk to.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.200
- About what?
- I'm doing a piece on your captain...

18:38.360 --> 18:41.440
...and wanted to ask you questions.
- Such as?

18:41.600 --> 18:45.360
His effectiveness,
people skills, relationships.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.640
He's very effective,
seems to do fine with people...

18:49.800 --> 18:53.680
...and his relationship is, he's my boss.
A very good one.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.800
He skipped a few steps in his rise
to captain. More desk than street time.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.160
- People resent that?
- I don't.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.680
One big happy family, huh?

19:02.840 --> 19:06.040
I don't know any family that doesn't
have the occasional disagreement.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.400
Neither do I.
You're talking about the Strike Team.

19:10.320 --> 19:11.760
Am I?

19:12.120 --> 19:15.480
Well, my sources confirm numerous
complaints of excessive force...

19:15.640 --> 19:19.560
...IAD investigations, civil suits...
- I don't know.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.840
I don't have your sources.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.400
- Carl totally rolled on Tulips.
- And Tulips totally rolled on Carl.

19:25.840 --> 19:30.400
He's a Svengali who got the dancers to
go in on his little bait-and-bash game.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.680
Carl says Tulips organized it.
She set up the muggings.

19:33.880 --> 19:37.760
- She's a hottie, not Amy Fisher.
- Bottom line, who's the ringleader?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.760
- Her.
- Him.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.480
This is the easiest case we've had
all year. Do I have to get involved?

19:43.640 --> 19:46.840
- No.
- Then get to the bottom of it.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.160
Or nail both of them for
kicking Shane's ass.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.360
I didn't get my ass kicked.
I got sucker-punched.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.040
Right. Sorry.

19:57.040 --> 19:59.600
Hey, what'd the doctor say?

19:59.760 --> 20:03.560
Until Aceveda subpoenas the prom
queen's medical records, I take pills...

20:03.720 --> 20:05.880
...get a blood test every 30 days.
- I'm sorry.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.040
I took my eyes off him.
It happened so fast.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.800
I hit him and his blood
got in your cut. If he's HIV...

20:10.960 --> 20:14.320
Look, Julien, it's not
like we shared needles.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.160
I screwed up, though.
I should have played this smarter.

20:17.320 --> 20:22.520
Well, it's just a bite, you know?
Drug kit I'm on, I got no worries.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.640
Hey. I heard what happened. You okay?

20:26.800 --> 20:30.440
Just a couple scratches. No big deal.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.400
You let loose pretty good on
that queer last night.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.560
Yeah.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.360
You did the right thing, Julien.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.680
That prick jumped you.
We need to send a message.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.160
- What kind of message?
- Blanket party.

20:49.320 --> 20:53.760
No, thanks. All right? It's in the past.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.400
You change your mind,
you let us know.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.360
What's a blanket party?

21:07.680 --> 21:09.760
Somebody likes to draw.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.720
Detective Wagenbach. Craves respect.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.160
Fantasizes about being well-liked...

21:17.400 --> 21:20.720
...yet shows no outward
manifestation of his low self-esteem.

21:20.880 --> 21:26.280
He is ignored, unappreciated.
Inadequate with women.

21:26.440 --> 21:31.120
It's just off some first impressions,
but I'll stand by it.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.080
Maybe you'd like to
read my palms too.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.160
Look at him.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.280
Tell me I'm wrong.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.880
It's why you became a cop.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.400
You thought by having a gun and
badge they'd respect you.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.080
They do.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.560
Even in a uniform, you were still a joke.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.040
That's why you became a detective.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.800
- Tell me more.
- Dutch.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.240
It's all right.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.640
You're the same Ionely
kid from high school.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.680
When you look in the mirror, you don't
see the person you wish you were.

22:11.880 --> 22:16.840
Just a lowly civil servant that you
hoped you'd never become.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.000
- I hope you're here to pick him up.
- Not yet.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.760
- What are you doing?
- I'm bringing some things to Connie.

22:28.920 --> 22:31.240
Is that where you were all night?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.720
Me and Ronnie are helping her.
She puked on her clothes. It's ugly.

22:34.920 --> 22:38.600
- How about me? It's ugly here too.
- I'm sorry.

22:39.120 --> 22:43.200
- Take this crack whore to detox.
- I can't. She'll lose him if I do.

22:43.360 --> 22:46.400
- What the hell's going on, Vic?
- What're you talking about?

22:46.600 --> 22:50.480
- I'm not stupid. What is it with her?
- Nothing.

22:50.680 --> 22:55.320
- Are you sleeping with her?
- Jesus. The kids.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.200
Oh, God.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.280
- Is this your son?
- Stop it.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.840
Tell me!

23:08.440 --> 23:11.280
I pulled her out
of a brawl two years ago.

23:12.280 --> 23:15.520
These Thai-towners were kicking
the shit out of her for stealing johns.

23:17.840 --> 23:22.920
I gave her my number. I told her
to call me if she needed help. She did.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.160
Cracked out on the floor
of a hotel bathroom.

23:26.320 --> 23:30.840
Six months pregnant, screaming,
crying, begging for forgiveness.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.960
I show up and find her
in a pool of bloody crystals.

23:36.240 --> 23:40.120
She tried to get rid of him with some
Drano and a plunger handle.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.320
I rushed them to Mission Cross.
They did an emergency C-section.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.000
Ten weeks premature.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.920
Jonesing at birth.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.520
He's a tough kid.

24:02.800 --> 24:08.000
- I have some old dresses in the garage.
- Thank you.

24:13.960 --> 24:18.600
We got a problem. Carl says
you organized the muggings.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.040
- What?
- Says he was just the muscle...

24:21.240 --> 24:24.800
...that you were the brains.
- You don't believe him, do you?

24:25.000 --> 24:28.520
No, of course not. But who
knows how a jury would see it.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.480
So, what can I do?

24:33.640 --> 24:36.720
Is there anything that you can
give me to prove Carl's guilt?

24:38.840 --> 24:41.800
- I don't know.
- You gotta work with me here.

24:41.960 --> 24:46.240
- Victim's names, dates.
- He set it up. I just did what he asked.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.160
There's only one deal
to be made here.

24:51.320 --> 24:55.240
And I'd really like to
see you get it.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.320
I want it.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.160
There's gotta be something
I can put on the table.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.560
Right?

25:10.520 --> 25:14.800
- I want you to explain yourself.
- What's to explain?

25:14.960 --> 25:18.480
- Why'd you bite my partner?
- To give her what I got.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.320
- You can't pass HIV through biting.
- Aren't you the expert?

25:25.040 --> 25:28.560
- So you were trying to kill her?
- I got it in jail.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.840
Cops put me in jail, so why
shouldn't I give it to cops?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.120
Look at you.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.480
You're the reason why
people hate faggots.

25:37.680 --> 25:42.640
Wanna give me a big kiss, lover?
I should have bitten both of you.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.840
- Where is it you're from again?
- La Unidad.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.480
- So, what is this room?
- Observation.

25:58.640 --> 26:03.160
Victims and witnesses can
safely identify suspects.

26:04.560 --> 26:08.360
And we get to monitor
interrogation techniques.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.840
About three years.

26:11.000 --> 26:14.360
- I have less free time than you'd think.
- That's right. You're...

26:14.520 --> 26:15.880
The harm on the Farm.

26:16.080 --> 26:20.280
That's what people call the policing
tactics in Farmington. Isn't it?

26:20.440 --> 26:25.320
That's just PR. Never hurts to have
the bad guys a little nervous.

26:25.480 --> 26:30.440
I'd say they're more than nervous.
The complaints suggest brutality.

26:31.360 --> 26:33.280
Really?

26:34.760 --> 26:37.360
Does your captain encourage
that type of law enforcement?

26:39.680 --> 26:42.000
I need my detective.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.720
- Who's that?
- What did you tell her?

26:48.880 --> 26:52.400
- Me? She's the one looking for dirt.
- So she goes where it's dirty?

26:52.600 --> 26:55.640
Hey. You and I don't like each other.
That's not a new headline.

26:55.840 --> 26:57.840
- No, it's not.
- But one thing you know...

26:58.240 --> 27:00.560
...if I come after you,
it'll be straight on.

27:00.720 --> 27:05.880
This one, cut your hands off and
smiles as she asks you to clap louder.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.760
If she keeps digging,
no one is gonna be happy.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.440
Agreed. So how do we shut her down?

27:19.440 --> 27:24.080
- I heard Danny went home early.
- The medicine makes her nauseous.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.520
- I hope she doesn't end up like Watson.
- Knock wood.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.800
- Who's Watson?
- Got stuck with a needle.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.920
- No one mentioned him before.
- What do you expect?

27:35.600 --> 27:39.760
A cop gets shot in the line of duty
and it's all twenty-one gun salutes.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.480
Some queer in a dress
gives you AIDS...

27:42.800 --> 27:45.200
...you end up unemployed
and the city's dirty secret.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.920
The guy who bit her couldn't care less.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.880
Just because Danny doesn't want to
give him a blanket party...

27:52.040 --> 27:54.920
...doesn't mean this fairy
doesn't deserve one.

28:01.520 --> 28:02.800
Count me in.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.800
- Last cage on the right. Let's go.
- How's the case coming?

28:06.960 --> 28:09.720
Sweet. Cut a deal with Tulips
to testify against Carl.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.800
Roped in the other girls
who were in on it.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.480
Consider the mugging book closed.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.800
Hey, I was doing a little
channel-surfing up in observation.

28:16.960 --> 28:19.880
I didn't know
we got the Spice Network.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.840
- You saw that.
- Yeah, I better not see any repeats.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.840
Hey, I talked to the girlies.
They all say the same thing.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.360
- Tulips was behind the whole thing.
- What?

28:28.560 --> 28:32.920
Yeah. Carl was just, like, her sexual
pawn she totally manipulated.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.600
Imagine that.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.000
Tulips. Tulips.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.160
So when am I getting out of here?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.600
I'm not too sure, darling.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.120
See, your dancer friends and Carl...

28:54.280 --> 28:58.680
...they have a different hit on who's
calling the shots in your little scam.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.440
You.

29:04.120 --> 29:08.920
- So, what are you saying?
- With their testimony...

29:09.360 --> 29:12.640
...two years is the best
I can get for you.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.720
I'm sorry.

29:19.680 --> 29:22.400
How much time are you getting
for sexual misconduct?

29:23.120 --> 29:27.480
- Pardon me?
- I got a yammy full of Georgia joy juice.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.320
Enough DNA to have you writing
parking tickets in Pacoima.

29:31.360 --> 29:34.280
So am I walking out of here...

29:34.440 --> 29:36.960
...or do we need to
call your supervisor?

29:47.360 --> 29:51.040
- Do I look okay?
- Beautiful.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.880
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.640
Would you like something to drink?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.560
- Yeah.
- You should lay down.

30:08.720 --> 30:13.320
- Okay. Can you get me some tea first?
- Sure.

30:33.400 --> 30:37.560
I'm tired of talking about my parents.
Let's talk about you.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.760
Now how does your father feel about
the way that your life's turned out?

30:41.920 --> 30:43.520
He's proud of me.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.440
Sure. That's what he says to your face.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.320
- Oh, man.
- Hey, guys. Come here.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.320
- You gotta check this out.
- What's up?

30:52.480 --> 30:55.240
- Dutch is getting hammered by a civvie.
- It's brutal.

30:55.400 --> 30:59.560
It's like watching a train wreck.
Only it's more horrific.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.400
Whatever you're after,
put it on the table.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.400
Okay.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.560
Tell me about increased
allegations of brutality.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.960
We're a proactive force.
Bad guys don't like to be arrested.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.840
Allegations are all they are.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.440
So you're not promoting use of force...

31:16.600 --> 31:19.000
...to inflate your
impressive crime statistics.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.880
- Please.
- Listen...

31:22.080 --> 31:23.880
...he's the top cop in this building.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.520
He gets results, but not
at the expense of the law.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.200
He deserves a lot of credit.

31:32.480 --> 31:36.480
What about your alleged rape of a
21 -year-old white girl?

31:37.160 --> 31:40.200
- What?
- Would you like to take credit for that?

31:41.800 --> 31:44.680
Vic, give us a minute.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.680
- What are you doing?
- A captain...

31:55.840 --> 31:58.520
...with a history of violence
commands the district...

31:58.680 --> 32:02.000
...with the highest percentage
of brutality complaints.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.400
Now he wants
to be on the city council.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.160
That was 15 years ago.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.000
Hospital records show...

32:08.160 --> 32:11.600
...Maureen Wilmore
had signs of bruising and burns.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.920
I'm not gonna discuss this.

32:15.120 --> 32:16.480
I have a wife and daughter.

32:16.640 --> 32:19.880
How would you feel if their rapist
wanted to be their representative?

32:21.240 --> 32:24.000
There's not a story here.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.240
I'll take that as a no comment.

32:52.280 --> 32:57.480
Truth is, I may not have been a
popular guy in school, but I got laid.

32:57.640 --> 32:58.800
More than a few times.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.480
I'm getting laid now too.
And guess what? She's hot.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.240
- Pathetic.
- Oh, man.

33:05.400 --> 33:10.040
- What's going on?
- Sherlock Holmes is getting smoked.

33:10.240 --> 33:13.480
Truth is, I just like to solve puzzles.

33:13.680 --> 33:17.480
I would've told you earlier, but I
needed time to do a few things.

33:18.400 --> 33:23.560
Now, here's what I know about you.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.920
You're perceptive.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.280
You can sense when
people are vulnerable.

33:32.040 --> 33:37.160
You have access
to other people's cars.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.000
That way, they can't be
traced back to you.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.240
Meticulous.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.480
There wasn't a speck
of dust in your shop.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.960
Because in your business,
you can't make any mistakes.

33:54.360 --> 33:59.520
Did you put a Sony CD player into
a green Ford Taurus five weeks ago?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.680
I don't know. I work on a lot of cars.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.520
Customer said you returned
it with a broken taillight.

34:05.720 --> 34:09.080
Now that does sound
vaguely familiar there.

34:15.760 --> 34:20.159
- You remember Sally, Sean?
- Should I, Dutch?

34:20.760 --> 34:25.000
Oh, my God. Someone stop it.

34:29.880 --> 34:33.040
- I wanna leave.
- You had the chance to leave earlier.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.800
Instead you decided to stick
around and show off.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.040
- The judge issued a search warrant.
- For what?

34:39.199 --> 34:43.600
- He gave us the keys to your place.
- You're not gonna find anything there.

34:43.760 --> 34:47.120
Just the standard collection of
bondage-domination porn.

34:47.840 --> 34:52.639
Which is why we also got a search
warrant for you aunt's house.

34:55.120 --> 34:58.800
- You can't do that.
- You cosigned the mortgage. We can.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.400
I thought this guy was
eating Dutch for lunch.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.040
Here. Let me draw you a picture, Sean.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.480
This...

35:08.800 --> 35:10.760
...is your aunt's house.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.680
This is the porch. And this...

35:15.120 --> 35:17.240
This is the crawl space...

35:17.400 --> 35:19.840
...the Pasadena P.D.
Just dug two bodies out of.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.880
How many more are
we gonna find, Sean?

35:25.040 --> 35:27.120
Five? Ten?

35:38.840 --> 35:42.520
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen?

35:46.320 --> 35:48.040
Jesus Christ.

35:48.360 --> 35:51.160
That's just under
the crawl space, you know?

35:51.320 --> 35:53.440
The other ones I dumped.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.480
I ran out of room under
my aunt's house.

36:02.080 --> 36:05.200
- It's pathetic.
- What is?

36:05.760 --> 36:08.200
How typical you are.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.240
Soon as you're caught,
you try to be special.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.920
I killed 22 people.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.880
Twenty-three, if you wanna count the
hunting accident back in Rockford.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.680
Oh, I'm special, all right.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.320
If you're so special...

36:31.480 --> 36:34.880
...how come a lowly civil servant
like me just caught you?

36:47.400 --> 36:50.200
- Yeah!
- Yeah, Dutch.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.800
- Great job, man.
- Thanks.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.520
- Hey, Dutch.
- Yeah?

36:57.680 --> 36:59.880
- Told you we'd get this guy.
- Yes, you did.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.120
I thought I was gonna have to
do all the work.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.280
Right.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.760
Good job.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.360
Thanks.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.200
Looks like you're quite the celebrity.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.080
- It's right over here.
- All right.

37:25.680 --> 37:27.640
I'm so sure I am.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.640
Way to go, Ron Jeremy.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.080
Simple investigation and you cage
everyone except the evil stripper.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.640
We got the guy who hit me.
And she's a dancer.

37:37.840 --> 37:42.200
Right. You think she'll have trouble
finding another loser with a tire iron?

37:42.360 --> 37:44.680
So everyone else here
is free to bang away.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.440
- Lem here is nailing Chiquita Banana.
- Hey.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.320
- You know what I'm saying.
- I'm tired of you saying it.

37:50.480 --> 37:52.320
Oh, so once again, I'm the asshole.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.840
Just leave Tigre out of this, all right?
I dig her.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.440
This whole West Side Story thing's
got a life span of two weeks, tops.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.680
What?

38:02.360 --> 38:04.320
- Where's Connie?
- Gone.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.360
Oh, shit.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.480
You're my wife. I don't wanna
keep anything from you.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.720
- Who is this woman?
- Maureen was a girlfriend...

38:15.880 --> 38:19.320
...at USC.
Her father is Chester Wilmore.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.040
- The publisher?
- Yeah.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.520
Maureen, she liked to play rough.

38:28.440 --> 38:33.720
Pleasure-pain kind of thing.
It was...

38:34.760 --> 38:36.280
Just tell me, David.

38:37.600 --> 38:43.080
One night we were drinking, and she
asked me to tie her up. I did.

38:43.720 --> 38:47.160
Pour hot wax on her stomach.
I did.

38:47.960 --> 38:51.560
She wanted me to choke her
to heighten the...

38:53.760 --> 38:56.960
I couldn't. It was too much.

38:57.560 --> 39:03.000
The next day, I broke up with her,
and she got pissed off. Obsessed.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.720
One night, she tracked me down,
and we got in this huge fight.

39:06.920 --> 39:10.360
She grabbed my
roommate's pocketknife.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.880
- I didn't get this scar rock climbing.
- Jesus.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.600
When that didn't get my attention,
she filed charges...

39:21.280 --> 39:23.880
...and got Daddy's lawyers involved.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.040
What kind of charges?

39:27.440 --> 39:31.080
Sexual battery.
Attempted rape.

39:32.640 --> 39:36.520
- It was a long time ago.
- My God, David.

39:37.320 --> 39:42.080
If Varela prints the story,
who knows what the public will believe.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.840
You wanna fight it?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.080
Babe, you just say the word...

39:47.240 --> 39:50.160
...and I will step away from all of this.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.800
Let the bitch come after you.

40:06.600 --> 40:09.000
Are you okay?

40:10.720 --> 40:13.000
Perfect.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.160
Sorry.

40:21.160 --> 40:25.600
- I tried.
- I know. Come here.

40:35.400 --> 40:40.320
- Well, is he okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, he's good.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.600
Good.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.160
Good.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.400
Look...

40:50.560 --> 40:52.360
...I just wanted to be sure.

40:52.560 --> 40:58.600
- You need help.
- I can't be helped.

41:03.520 --> 41:04.840
He can.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.120
He's a good boy, Vic.

41:12.440 --> 41:15.480
- Someone will love him.
- He's your boy.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.520
A happy white baby.

41:20.720 --> 41:24.320
Couples will be fighting over him.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.880
He needs his mother.

41:41.520 --> 41:44.800
That's just not me.

42:12.920 --> 42:15.440
There you go.

42:19.280 --> 42:23.160
- No! No! No!
- Come on, come on, man.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.440
- No! No!
- She's your partner, man.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.160
- Come on!
- Shut up.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.360
Shut up.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.520
Shut up.

42:35.800 --> 42:38.680
Shut up!

42:40.120 --> 42:44.120
- All right. Julien!
- That's enough, dude! You'll kill him!

42:44.280 --> 42:48.360
- Shut him up!
- Come on. All right.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.600
Dutchster, great job.
