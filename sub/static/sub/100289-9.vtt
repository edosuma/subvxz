02:06.209 --> 02:08.962
What's happening? Is she okay?
Is she waking up?

02:09.045 --> 02:10.839
It's just time to change her IV bag.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.382
Oh.

02:14.759 --> 02:18.179
[Carol] She hit her head on the ice,
but she'll be okay.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.942
Hey. Look who's finally up.

02:32.527 --> 02:33.653
How did I get here?

02:33.736 --> 02:35.530
[Carol]
I told you, honey. You had an episode.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.699
Justin found you in his bathtub, shaking.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.660
He said you kept asking for me.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.621
-It's all kind of fuzzy.
-I know it is.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.208
But the good news is Justin called <i>me</i>
and not the hospital.

02:48.084 --> 02:51.087
And I got you right back on your lithium
so your secret's safe,

02:51.171 --> 02:53.882
and that's really all you can ask for
when you have an episode.

02:54.841 --> 02:58.011
Oh, and this time I told everyone you have
pneumonia, so no one will think twice

02:58.094 --> 02:59.846
when you don't show up
at Sectionals tomorrow.

03:00.638 --> 03:01.723
Tomorrow?

03:03.349 --> 03:04.767
How long have I been asleep?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.562
Three... four. Four days.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.147
I mean, I can't even keep track,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.441
and I'm not the one
adjusting to the lithium.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.860
I need to call Justin.
He must be freaking out.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.153
Has he come by or...

03:17.989 --> 03:19.199
He didn't come see me?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.161
It's a lot to take in.
Why don't you give him a minute.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.625
Well...

03:28.708 --> 03:30.710
What does he know? What did you tell him?

03:32.086 --> 03:33.463
Well, he knows you have bipolar.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.133
But I made him promise
not to say anything.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.719
I can't believe I was so stupid.

03:39.802 --> 03:42.764
Hey! Look, our disorder's hard enough
without beating ourselves up about it

03:42.847 --> 03:44.432
every time the symptoms come back.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.976
Except I had it under control.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.604
At least I did until I fell.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.108
Mistakes happen. Skaters fall.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.069
You know? But right now,

03:56.152 --> 03:59.239
all you need to worry about
is putting the past in the past

Yeah, she's okay. Yeah, she's hating
she's missing Sectionals tomorrow,

Pneumonia's a bitch.

-It's my hotel.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.557

05:07.974 --> 05:09.642
You threw a huge party

05:09.726 --> 05:11.644
while your girlfriend had pneumonia.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.146
I'm a bad boyfriend.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.481
Yeah.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.568
Because Mandy doesn't think so.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.988
She thinks you're crazy about this girl,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.282
that you've been turning a corner lately,

05:24.365 --> 05:25.908
finally growing up.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.660
But you don't.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.749
I promised her I'd give you
the opportunity to prove me wrong.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.628
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you out.

-she lives in the US, and--
-And she's happy.

that I'm living my best life

in his room.

So, basically, what you're saying
is that I can skate again.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.126
Sorry.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.504
You should be ready to start
physical therapy pretty soon,

11:53.587 --> 11:56.257
which means
you won't be my patient anymore.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.384
So...

11:59.218 --> 12:00.344
do you drink coffee?

12:00.428 --> 12:01.637
Why?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.765
Is there some kind of healing property
to caffeine?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.059
Because I'll inject it
straight into my veins.

What are you doing here?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.427
I thought your wrist was getting better.

12:41.510 --> 12:46.015
Yeah, I just wanted to get it checked out
once more before Sectionals, just in case.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.642
Serena, I can see you now.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.647
Bye, Jenn. I'll make sure
the office gets you that referral.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.281
Give me all the shots.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.075
[Marcus] It's not even noon.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.953
You think I fucking care what time it is?

13:16.796 --> 13:17.797
[sighs]

13:19.799 --> 13:22.051
I just turned down a date
with a really great guy

13:22.134 --> 13:23.969
who isn't drilling my ex-best friend.

13:24.345 --> 13:26.388
If he's so great, why'd you turn him down?

13:26.472 --> 13:27.765
Have you met me lately?

13:28.390 --> 13:30.726
I'm basically a failure
with no self-esteem.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.355
Literally, the only bright spot in my life
is that Kat has pneumonia

13:34.438 --> 13:35.815
and can't go to Sectionals either.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.358
Pneumonia?

13:37.441 --> 13:38.776
-[Jenn] Hm.
-Huh.

13:38.859 --> 13:39.860
That sucks.

13:41.028 --> 13:42.029
I got you beat.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.782
I turned down medical school to ski,

13:44.865 --> 13:47.117
and then I got myself kicked off
the ski team.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.786
What? When did that happen?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.080
Around the same time Kat got pneumonia.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.170
To shattered hips and shattered dreams.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.382
[cell phone buzzing]

14:04.051 --> 14:04.927
You know what?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.470
I think I'll join you.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.525
[Carol] Was I right, or was I right?

14:19.608 --> 14:21.819
There's not another property
like it in Sun Valley.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.821
You'll have a wait list on every unit.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.573
[man] Mandy was not exaggerating.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.366
What do you mean?

14:27.449 --> 14:30.160
Well, I told her,
"If you're not gonna show me around today,

14:30.244 --> 14:31.620
you'd better send your best."

14:32.705 --> 14:33.873
And she picked me.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.042
I get a sense about someone
as soon as I meet 'em.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.753
I get a hell of a sense about you, Carol.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.549
And I have a hell of a sense
that this is the right property for you.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.176
So much so
that I drew up the offer papers.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.053
Oh, I thought
you were just being a gentleman

14:48.137 --> 14:49.638
and showing me back to my hotel.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.681
[chuckles]

14:50.764 --> 14:53.767
Look, full disclosure, I'm also interested
in some investment property

14:53.851 --> 14:54.977
in Park City and Vail.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.771
Which is why I have to convince you
that Sun Valley's the right choice.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.150
Or maybe you should get me liquored up,

15:01.233 --> 15:03.319
and I'll be more interested
in signing your papers.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.489
A bottle of champagne.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.164
[elevator bell chimes]

15:23.797 --> 15:25.799
[indistinct chatter]

15:29.053 --> 15:31.055
[laughter]

15:38.520 --> 15:41.649
[laughter continues]

15:44.652 --> 15:45.653
[man chuckling]

15:46.487 --> 15:47.821
-[man] Take that!
-Kat!

15:48.322 --> 15:51.075
Hey. What are you doing out of bed?
I thought you had pneumonia?

15:51.158 --> 15:53.285
-I've been trying to reach you.
-Have you?

15:53.369 --> 15:55.120
Sorry, I've been kind of busy.

15:55.788 --> 16:00.209
Look, my sister told me
I threw a rager the other night, and...

16:01.043 --> 16:04.088
I just need to know
if anyone else saw me like that.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.007
Just the weird randos you invited over.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.010
Marcus and Alana
kinda showed up later, too.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.888
[sighs] So they know too?

16:13.722 --> 16:14.556
I guess.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.059
Listen, I can't really talk about this
right now.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.353
Kinda in the middle
of my going-away party.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.980
You're going away?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.273
I mean, we definitely can't skate
after what happened,

16:23.691 --> 16:27.403
and my dad is kicking me out
after the rager I threw, so...

16:28.862 --> 16:31.949
I'm sorry. I wasn't myself, and...

16:32.366 --> 16:35.536
He and I were in a pretty good place there
for a minute, but that all went to shit.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.453
Oh, well.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.667
-Justin, I--
-It's cool.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.711
Anyway, you do you. I'll do me.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.046
-Good luck.
-Wait...

16:47.464 --> 16:48.841
You're breaking up with me?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.345
[Justin] Hey, is it my turn yet?

17:16.326 --> 17:19.621
So... are you drunk enough to tell me
what happened with the ski team?

17:20.330 --> 17:21.165
Nope.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.499
Fine.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.168
Then I gotta pee.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.965
[cell phone buzzing]

17:30.049 --> 17:31.133
[Jenn sighs]

17:33.177 --> 17:34.219
[phone clicks]

17:34.303 --> 17:36.930
What the hell? I saw that.
Why the fuck did you miss the race?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.600
[Marcus] Dude, I'm at work!

17:40.184 --> 17:41.143
I overslept.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.519
What you told Coach is bullshit.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.814
Do you know that I vouched for you to
even get on the team in the first place?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.900
You fucked up,
right before we were supposed to train

17:47.983 --> 17:48.984
in Argentina this summer.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.028
-That makes me look bad.
-Can't have that.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.905
[grunts]

17:56.492 --> 17:59.536
You startin' shit,
but I'll be the one who pays for it.

18:01.830 --> 18:02.998
[Brent] Yeah, whatever.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.545
[elevator bell chimes]

18:10.798 --> 18:11.715
Marcus!

18:11.799 --> 18:13.425
[Kat] Hey, can we talk?

18:13.509 --> 18:16.595
Justin told me that you and Alana
showed up to the party the other night.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.931
I was probably acting a little weird.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.140
A <i>little </i>weird?

18:21.433 --> 18:22.434
A lot weird.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.228
I don't know...

18:24.728 --> 18:26.438
I think maybe I just had
too much to drink.

18:26.522 --> 18:27.356
That's not why.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.943
Alana has a cousin with the same thing.
She figured it out.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.945
[sighs]

18:33.028 --> 18:35.030
Can we just keep this between us...

18:35.739 --> 18:38.033
and tell Alana to do the same thing?

18:39.493 --> 18:40.953
Please don't be mad at me.

18:41.036 --> 18:44.331
-You don't understand how hard this is.
-You're right. I don't.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.416
Because you didn't give me that option.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.961
If you'd just told me the truth,
maybe I could've helped out

18:49.044 --> 18:50.379
before shit got so fucked up.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.880
-I'm sorry--
-For what?

18:51.964 --> 18:53.674
For getting me kicked off the ski team?

18:53.757 --> 18:56.969
Or maybe because I got arrested
for trying to protect you.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.263
Or is it because I had to spend
the entire weekend in jail

18:59.346 --> 19:02.307
because the judge didn't show up
until Monday morning? Or...

19:03.058 --> 19:06.145
because the asshole
you got into a fight with pressed charges.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.522
-Oh, my God. I--
-Just...

19:09.648 --> 19:10.649
I gotta go.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.326
[Carol]
All that's left to do is sign the papers.

19:21.410 --> 19:22.244
Oh, you need a pen.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.956
[elevator bell chimes]

19:26.039 --> 19:28.584
[slow beeping]

19:33.255 --> 19:34.548
I'm not a bad mother.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.718
I'm not a bad mother.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.512
[repeating] I'm not a bad mother.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.645
-We'll have to do this another time.
-Is everything okay?

19:54.401 --> 19:55.986
What the hell do you think you're doing?

19:56.069 --> 19:57.905
People with pneumonia
don't go walking around.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.657
[Carol] We have to get you out of here
before anyone sees.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.756
You sure you don't wanna come?
His dad's like a sheikh or something.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.175
Nah, you go ahead. I gotta get packed.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.177
-All right. Fine.
-[man] Later!

20:26.183 --> 20:27.809
[Jenn] So Kat doesn't have pneumonia.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.478
-Oh, hey.
-Did you know that?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.189
I don't know what that girl's
up to anymore.

20:32.272 --> 20:35.359
She's your girlfriend and skating partner.
Don't you think you should?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.570
Wait. Are you two broken up?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.365
Yeah, basically.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.909
Oh, my God.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.454
I can't believe
<i>I</i> was obsessed with <i>you.</i>

20:47.996 --> 20:49.581
I'm gonna say yes to coffee.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.753
Wait. Are you leaving?

20:55.712 --> 20:56.546
Yeah.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.007
Because of Kat?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.556
You really liked her.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.565
[Jenn] Come here.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.407
Fucking Kat.

21:25.784 --> 21:26.743
Yeah.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.414
[Carol] I am not having this conversation
right now.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.874
But if I'd just told
Justin and Marcus the truth, then--

21:32.958 --> 21:34.710
Then they would have only
walked away sooner.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.045
-Thanks.
-I can't believe you went to the lodge

21:37.129 --> 21:38.297
where anyone could see you.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.007
You have no idea the shit that can happen

21:40.090 --> 21:42.134
if you don't manage the fallout
after an episode.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.678
Okay, I've fucked up and done things
that I can never take back.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.515
I don't want that to happen to you.
You have to trust me on this.

21:48.932 --> 21:51.143
Remember, it's all about the long game.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.022
God!

21:56.565 --> 21:58.900
Oh, God. It's like pulling teeth with her.

21:59.776 --> 22:03.488
If this gets out, it won't be,
"Olympic Champion, Kat Baker."

22:03.572 --> 22:06.908
It'll be, "That poor, crazy skater girl
with bipolar disorder."

22:08.285 --> 22:09.161
God!

22:09.578 --> 22:10.996
How'd it go today with Serena?

22:11.079 --> 22:11.955
[Mitch] Uh...

22:12.039 --> 22:13.206
Could have been better.

22:13.290 --> 22:17.377
Serena's biggest competitor,
Bethany Strokenfeld, is back in.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.839
What, that chick from Boise
with the triple axel?

22:20.922 --> 22:22.257
I thought she had shin splints.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.175
Oh, she does.

22:23.258 --> 22:25.635
She told Serena, and I quote,

22:25.719 --> 22:27.304
"I am, like,

22:27.387 --> 22:31.058
totally hopped out
on extra-strength ibuprofen. It's insane."

22:31.475 --> 22:35.062
Anyway, Serena's in her room
texting up public sympathy.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.272
Well, good. Let her skate.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.358
Serena's gonna
take that little bitch down.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.486
-[chuckles]
-Thank you for driving her today.

22:42.861 --> 22:44.863
You made this shit day easier to handle.

22:44.946 --> 22:45.864
Of course.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.661
I--

22:51.745 --> 22:53.455
I know you're looking out for Kat,

22:54.122 --> 22:55.624
but, um...

22:56.291 --> 23:01.088
public perception is changing around
mental health issues, even in sports.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.048
Not in figure skating. You know that.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.759
It's all about being perfect.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.804
I mean, the image is just as important
as landing the jumps.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.849
When people find out,
they can't walk away fast enough.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.312
I'm not running away.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.440
Well, you're not exactly moving in here,
are you?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.651
We never even spoke about this
until this morning.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.861
Let's talk about it now.
Do you want to move in with me?

23:24.945 --> 23:27.447
There is middle ground between moving in
and running away.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.282
Look, I'm not an idiot, Mitch.

23:29.366 --> 23:31.660
Okay? You saw me at my worst.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.829
It scared you. Admit it.

23:33.912 --> 23:37.499
No! I-- I wanted time to think about it.
Your disorder has nothing to do with that.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.376
What's your reason then?

23:40.335 --> 23:41.336
Oh, come on!

23:42.838 --> 23:43.839
Are you serious?

23:44.965 --> 23:48.260
You expect me to commit to a life together
based on a random conversation

23:48.343 --> 23:49.344
over beans on toast?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.638
We haven't even said "I love you,"
for fuck's sake!

23:51.721 --> 23:53.432
Fine. I love you!

23:53.515 --> 23:55.809
There! Now what's your excuse?

23:59.729 --> 24:00.564
You should go.

24:06.736 --> 24:07.904
[door opens]

24:08.780 --> 24:10.073
[door closes]

24:11.199 --> 24:12.742
[knocking on door]

24:18.081 --> 24:19.499
Oh, good. You're here!

24:20.625 --> 24:21.918
I need your help.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.337
[Justin] Is everything okay?

24:24.421 --> 24:25.464
Is it your eyes?

24:26.590 --> 24:31.219
So if Kat messaged you "hello"
after not speaking for 40 years,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.138
how would you respond?

24:33.221 --> 24:36.475
I'd probably say, "Fuck you, Kat." Why?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.937
Don't answer questions with questions,
and watch your mouth.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.692
[sighs] Also, you cannot
be mad at Katarina for being sick.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.236
She'll be better in a week
and will skate again.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.114
Actually, uh...

24:52.324 --> 24:54.910
I'll be leaving town tomorrow for a while.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.581
Now that we're not going to Sectionals,
I thought it'd be a good time.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.458
Where are you going?

25:02.250 --> 25:03.793
[sighs] I don't know.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.421
Anyways...

25:07.506 --> 25:09.841
thanks so much for everything, and, uh...

25:12.052 --> 25:13.220
Yeah.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.304
Justin...

25:16.973 --> 25:18.642
what is it you're not telling me?

25:20.727 --> 25:21.561
Nothing.

25:23.897 --> 25:24.731
I'll see ya.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.489
I'd probably say "hello" back.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.035
If that helps.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.373
[door opens]

25:43.166 --> 25:44.501
[knocking on door]

25:46.586 --> 25:49.381
-I would like to see Katarina.
-What? You can't just walk in here!

25:49.464 --> 25:50.549
Yes, I can.

25:53.593 --> 25:55.470
Are you really sick, Katarina?

25:56.388 --> 25:59.266
-Of course she's sick. Look at her!
-I'm talking to your daughter, not you.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.725
Do you have pneumonia?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.564
I'm giving you one more chance
to tell me the truth.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.275
For your safety
and the safety of your partner,

26:08.358 --> 26:12.320
the relationship between coach
and student must be based on total trust.

26:18.368 --> 26:19.494
I have pneumonia.

26:20.996 --> 26:21.955
That's too bad.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.458
I had such hopes for you.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.503
I'm no longer your coach.

26:29.254 --> 26:30.338
What?

26:30.422 --> 26:33.174
Good! Maybe if she had a better coach,
she wouldn't have got pneumonia.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.552
[door closes]

26:35.635 --> 26:36.469
[Carol] It's fine.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.556
Okay? You survived losing Vicky and Liz.
You'll survive the Russian.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.433
[cell phone buzzing]

26:42.559 --> 26:45.729
Shit. I gotta take this, but I'll be back
to check on you in a little bit, okay?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.063
Maybe we'll do our nails.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.205
[sighs]

27:05.373 --> 27:06.207
Hi, Mandy.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.544
Look, I fucked up. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have just left like that.

27:09.961 --> 27:11.713
[Serena]
Is it true Kat's blood went so deep

27:11.796 --> 27:14.257
they finally had to cut out
a whole section of the ice?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.176
What? No! Who told you that?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.260
Bethany.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.641
She said that I'm brave for skating
where Kat cracked her skull open.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.434
She thinks that our family's cursed.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.478
Mandy, can you just give me one second?

27:27.687 --> 27:29.648
Our family is fine. Okay?

27:29.731 --> 27:32.651
Bethany is trying to psych you out
because she doesn't want you to beat her.

27:32.734 --> 27:33.860
What if I freak out?

27:34.903 --> 27:36.279
[sighs] Oh, my God!

27:36.655 --> 27:37.739
I just wish Kat never fell.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.032
And you think I don't?

27:40.241 --> 27:42.327
Now, go pack for Sectionals.
I gotta finish this call.

27:45.830 --> 27:48.667
Hey. I'm sorry, Mandy. Kat was coughing.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.461
No, honestly, it's been horrible.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.646
[footsteps approaching]

28:16.778 --> 28:18.113
This fucking day.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.949
[Alana] Hmm.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.206
A guest complained to me
that her toast wasn't toasted enough,

28:28.289 --> 28:29.833
and I had to pretend to care.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.963
Kind of like you're doing right now.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.177
So, did you talk to your coach?

28:41.636 --> 28:42.637
And say what?

28:43.430 --> 28:46.015
That I had the wrong day
marked on my calendar?

28:46.099 --> 28:48.643
Or that I got so sick
that I couldn't even call?

28:49.644 --> 28:51.813
There's nothing I can say
that'll make it okay.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.481
You could try the truth.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.358
[scoffs] Okay. Yeah.

28:56.317 --> 29:00.363
"Hey, Coach. I got arrested for punching
a drug addict in the middle of a rager,

29:00.447 --> 29:01.740
but it's not my fault."

29:03.825 --> 29:05.702
It's been a hard week on both of us.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.747
I didn't do anything.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.956
I know you didn't.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.333
No matter how hard I work,

29:12.834 --> 29:14.294
no matter how much I accomplish,

29:14.377 --> 29:18.214
at the end of the day, I'm just another
black man who landed himself in jail.

29:20.383 --> 29:21.384
Marcus...

29:25.138 --> 29:28.057
You ran in there without even thinking
about it to help your friend.

29:28.516 --> 29:31.227
-You did the right thing.
-[laughs]

29:31.811 --> 29:33.271
Look what good it did me.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.235
I'm scared.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.453
[Dr. Parker] So, I reset the bone,

29:48.536 --> 29:50.997
and I made a splint out of sticks.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.833
-[both laughing]
-My mom...

29:54.584 --> 29:57.045
told the doctor
what I'd done for my brother,

29:57.128 --> 30:00.048
and he looked me in the eye,
and he said, "Kid...

30:01.007 --> 30:01.883
I'm paying for you

30:01.966 --> 30:04.636
-to go to medical school."
-Whoa! Are you serious?

30:04.719 --> 30:05.678
He was also my dad.

30:06.054 --> 30:06.930
Oh!

30:07.013 --> 30:08.181
-That helped.
-[laughing]

30:08.264 --> 30:10.266
[cell phone buzzing]

30:12.894 --> 30:15.605
-[clears throat]
-Is that the standard emergency call

30:15.688 --> 30:17.315
to get you out of here
if I was too boring?

30:17.398 --> 30:19.234
-[laughs] No!
-[phone continues buzzing]

30:19.317 --> 30:24.823
I have a couple of concierge patients
who need a lot of reassurance,

30:25.490 --> 30:29.285
but I am finally hanging out with someone

30:30.161 --> 30:32.038
I've kinda had a crush on

30:32.121 --> 30:34.040
for a very long time, so...

30:34.999 --> 30:36.000
it can wait.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.006
I'm really glad you called.

30:45.301 --> 30:46.261
Me too.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.972
So... [sighs]

30:49.055 --> 30:53.184
I wanna hear more about Grandma Yu.
Is that your mom's or dad's side?

30:53.685 --> 30:54.644
Uh...

30:55.186 --> 30:56.020
both.

30:56.563 --> 30:58.857
Did I not mention my parents
are brother and sister?

30:58.940 --> 31:00.400
It's why I have bad hips.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.569
[both laughing]

31:02.652 --> 31:04.195
That's-- No, no. That's cool.

31:04.279 --> 31:07.782
If that's the story you want to go with,
that's fine. [laughs]

31:10.535 --> 31:12.370
I made you some hot cocoa.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.163
What are you doing?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.082
Justin and I are still on the schedule.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.542
Well, of course you are.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.669
It made it more believable
that you had pneumonia.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.337
That's what I thought. You're a genius.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.089
But you can't skate.

31:23.172 --> 31:26.217
-You're still adjusting to your lithium.
-I've skated tired before.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.261
Not after an episode.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.722
You're not thinking rationally.

31:30.805 --> 31:32.599
Look, it's perfect. Okay?

31:32.682 --> 31:34.058
I'll find Justin and Dasha.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.728
I'll tell them I'm feeling better.
I'll say I'm sorry.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.479
I'll beg them to forgive me.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.690
No one at the competition
will know I'm bipolar,

31:40.773 --> 31:42.442
and we can go through our routine tonight.

31:42.525 --> 31:43.693
-I'll be ready.
-No.

31:44.110 --> 31:47.030
Okay? It's too dangerous.
You can go to Sectionals next year.

31:47.113 --> 31:50.074
Not without a coach, Mom,
and not without a partner.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.493
If I don't do this, it's all over!

31:52.994 --> 31:56.748
There's no point in keeping
this huge secret if I can't skate.

31:57.582 --> 31:59.000
Kat, please.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.044
Why are you so obsessed with me not going?

32:01.127 --> 32:03.588
The last time you were
at that rink, you almost fucking died!

32:05.882 --> 32:07.592
Look, I know I shouldn't yell.

32:08.051 --> 32:09.260
It's just-- I can't...

32:10.595 --> 32:13.014
I can't bear for anything else
to happen to you.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.643
Okay? And if you see where you fell
and you're not fully yourself yet,

32:16.726 --> 32:18.269
it could take you back.

32:18.853 --> 32:21.147
-You have to think of the long--
-The long game.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.065
I know.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.069
I'm sorry, Mom.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.488
I'm going. You can't stop me.

32:31.157 --> 32:35.495
Look, I will lock you in this house for
the rest of your entire life if I have to.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.038
[Carol] Hey!

32:37.956 --> 32:38.790
That's it.

32:39.415 --> 32:41.960
-I'm not going with Serena to Sectionals.
-[Serena] What?

32:42.460 --> 32:43.962
You're not gonna be there?

32:44.045 --> 32:46.798
I could win this weekend.
I could go on to Nationals.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.467
Serena, honey, let's just stop thinking
about yourself for a second.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.970
You have no idea what it's like
to live with mental illness.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.221
Yes, I do.

32:54.889 --> 32:58.309
I'm the one that suffers
whenever you or Kat goes crazy.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.645
This will never end for me, will it?

33:01.062 --> 33:04.023
She's just as fucked up as you are,
and she's never not gonna be fucked up.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.441
Serena!

33:05.525 --> 33:07.151
I'm tired of it, Kat.

33:08.194 --> 33:12.323
Of being second,
of no one ever giving a fuck about me!

33:12.407 --> 33:13.700
Oh, please!

33:13.783 --> 33:17.203
Of keeping your stupid secrets!

33:20.456 --> 33:22.875
Ask Mom why Vicky made you change
your lutz at the last minute.

33:22.959 --> 33:24.252
Shut up, Serena!

33:24.836 --> 33:28.256
Vicky didn't want to. She said that it was
too risky to lift your arms.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.924
Wait. What are you talking about?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.426
-Mom said she'd fire her...
-Shut up!

33:31.509 --> 33:33.261
...if she didn't make you do it.
Stop, Mom!

33:33.344 --> 33:36.431
[Serena]
I was there! Okay? I heard everything.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.892
[Serena] <i>It's your fault she fell.</i>

33:41.769 --> 33:42.812
[beeping]

33:45.106 --> 33:47.817
When Kat wakes up, we're going to tell her
that Vicky made her do it.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.152
Do you understand me?

33:49.235 --> 33:51.738
Hey. Promise me
that you're never gonna tell her.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.281
Promise me!

33:59.537 --> 34:01.122
Guess the secret's out now, huh, Mom?

34:01.914 --> 34:03.124
Look, I am so, so sorry.

34:03.207 --> 34:07.170
I-- I didn't take my meds that day,
and I wasn't thinking clearly.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.256
You had to have known
that lifting my arms at the last second

34:10.339 --> 34:11.674
would throw off my lutz.

34:11.758 --> 34:14.802
I never practiced it like that.
You knew that was dangerous!

34:14.886 --> 34:16.929
You weren't gonna win
if you didn't have those points!

34:17.013 --> 34:18.097
I did it for you.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.224
I never meant for you to get hurt.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.061
Everything went wrong after that fall!

34:26.731 --> 34:27.982
You're a bad mother.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.116
[door opens]

34:37.200 --> 34:38.117
[door slams]

35:17.740 --> 35:18.783
[Kat] <i>Dear Dasha...</i>

35:20.159 --> 35:21.828
<i>I want you to know who I am.</i>

35:22.370 --> 35:23.621
<i>No more hiding.</i>

35:23.704 --> 35:24.872
<i>No more secrets.</i>

35:25.873 --> 35:27.125
<i>You were right.</i>

35:27.208 --> 35:28.501
<i>I don't have pneumonia.</i>

35:29.293 --> 35:30.586
<i>But I was sick.</i>

35:31.212 --> 35:33.089
<i>I have bipolar disorder.</i>

35:33.881 --> 35:37.009
<i>I was scared that</i>
<i>if you knew the truth, Marcus,</i>

35:37.093 --> 35:38.803
<i>that's all you'd see me as...</i>

35:39.345 --> 35:41.222
<i>a girl with a mental disorder.</i>

35:42.431 --> 35:45.268
<i>I thought that if I stopped</i>
<i>taking my meds, we could win,</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:47.436
<i>but I was putting you in danger.</i>

35:48.020 --> 35:50.773
<i>You gave me your trust,</i>
<i>but I didn't deserve it, Justin.</i>

35:51.482 --> 35:53.484
<i>I just hope you can forgive me.</i>

35:54.610 --> 35:59.240
<i>I kept my secret because I didn't want</i>
<i>anything to change between us, Jenn.</i>

36:00.783 --> 36:03.161
<i>But by not telling you the truth,</i>

36:04.203 --> 36:05.788
<i>that's exactly what happened.</i>

36:07.582 --> 36:11.335
I don't remember everything
that happened during my mania,

36:12.879 --> 36:14.213
but I do know that...

36:15.298 --> 36:16.674
even at my worst,

36:18.467 --> 36:19.719
Justin was there for me.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.557
I just thought you needed to know that.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.393
Thank you for telling me.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.776
I should, um...

36:36.569 --> 36:38.196
I should go talk to my son, huh?

36:41.741 --> 36:43.743
[James sighs]

36:49.457 --> 36:50.499
[Marcus] My guy!

36:50.583 --> 36:52.126
All right, man. I'm outta here.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.503
-[man] Do your thing.
-[Marcus chuckles]

36:55.004 --> 36:56.547
[Marcus laughs]

37:00.009 --> 37:02.094
-[Kat] You're back on the ski team?
-Yeah.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.890
You know, your note made me realize
I should tell my coach the truth

37:05.973 --> 37:07.391
about why I missed the race.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.269
I leave for Argentina tomorrow morning.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.604
I've got to keep training

37:11.687 --> 37:14.482
if I'm gonna have any chance
of making it to the Olympics.

37:15.149 --> 37:16.567
And what did Alana say?

37:17.109 --> 37:18.236
"Took you long enough."

37:18.319 --> 37:19.820
[both laugh]

37:21.739 --> 37:23.574
So I guess this is goodbye.

37:25.576 --> 37:26.827
I'm happy for you.

37:28.871 --> 37:29.747
Me too.

37:31.582 --> 37:32.917
I'll see you in the fall.

37:47.932 --> 37:48.766
Hi.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.143
Hi.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.605
Bipolar.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.149
That's a big word.

37:58.818 --> 37:59.652
I know.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.991
Not gonna lie,
I've got a lot of questions.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.208
[sighs]

38:14.292 --> 38:15.543
Ask me anything.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.798
This is why you disappeared last year.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.805
So...

38:29.181 --> 38:31.100
when did this start happening?

38:36.022 --> 38:38.024
[knocking on door]

38:45.114 --> 38:45.948
Can I come in?

38:47.575 --> 38:48.826
It's your hotel, right?

38:52.330 --> 38:53.331
You, uh...

38:53.998 --> 38:55.166
come to check up on me?

38:56.459 --> 38:58.794
Don't worry.
I'll be out of here in the morning.

39:05.634 --> 39:06.469
Uh...

39:07.011 --> 39:07.845
Kat...

39:09.013 --> 39:09.889
came to see me.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.809
She told me everything.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.147
Um...

39:20.524 --> 39:21.359
I'm sorry...

39:22.109 --> 39:23.819
for what I said to you earlier.

39:26.947 --> 39:29.617
You remind me so goddamn much
of your mother.

39:30.076 --> 39:32.745
The twins, they're-- they're all me...

39:32.828 --> 39:35.331
straightforward, rough around the edges...

39:38.501 --> 39:39.960
but you're your mother's son.

39:42.088 --> 39:43.547
I look at you, I see her.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.509
I said things to you
that I shouldn't have

39:46.592 --> 39:48.886
'cause I was so angry at her
for leaving me.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.097
For leaving you.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.310
What you did for Kat,

39:58.813 --> 39:59.814
protecting her,

40:01.524 --> 40:03.067
that's your mother's goodness.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.861
Her self-sacrifice.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.574
But if I could've got over my anger,
I would have seen that in you sooner.

40:12.743 --> 40:13.744
[Justin tuts]

40:17.373 --> 40:18.541
So, uh...

40:22.002 --> 40:24.088
you still want me out in the morning,
or...

40:24.505 --> 40:25.506
[James laughs]

40:30.678 --> 40:32.638
Yeah, of course you can stay...

40:32.721 --> 40:33.681
for now.

40:39.311 --> 40:40.146
Hey...

40:40.813 --> 40:41.939
You gotta talk to Kat.

40:42.648 --> 40:44.900
You can't be mad at her for being sick.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.529
It's not why I'm upset, Dad.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.538
Do you have kids?

40:59.874 --> 41:00.708
I do.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.961
Best fucking thing I ever did.

41:12.636 --> 41:13.888
[man] Look who's back.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.516
Yes, hi.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.144
Sorry I had to rush off like that.
It was...

41:20.644 --> 41:21.770
There was something...

41:22.605 --> 41:24.523
-personal I had to deal with.
-Oh.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.234
Not a boyfriend, I hope.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.320
No.

41:29.403 --> 41:31.363
Nope, not at all. No boyfriend.

41:33.073 --> 41:34.909
Then what do you say we finish that drink?

41:35.409 --> 41:36.243
Yeah.

41:40.915 --> 41:44.168
Everything is so fucked up with my family,
and Sectionals is a disaster,

41:44.251 --> 41:47.254
and I didn't have anyone else to talk to,
and I just really wanted to see you.

41:47.338 --> 41:51.717
Feels like we had sex, and then you
didn't wanna hear from me anymore.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.844
And why haven't you been answering me?

41:53.928 --> 41:56.514
I'm so sorry, Serena. I...

41:57.973 --> 41:59.934
I was in surgery all afternoon. I...

42:00.017 --> 42:03.145
[sighs] One of my patients
got in a skiing accident.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.356
Oh.

42:06.815 --> 42:07.942
Sorry I got weird.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.656
Tomorrow's supposed to be
the best day of my life,

42:13.739 --> 42:16.200
and it just feels like
everything's falling apart.

42:19.745 --> 42:23.415
I wish you could come watch me skate,
you know?

42:27.294 --> 42:28.128
Okay.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.050
Okay? [laughs]

42:34.385 --> 42:35.553
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:35.636 --> 42:36.845
You would do that?

42:36.929 --> 42:38.764
I'll say I'm there for a patient.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.102
I'm so lucky I have you.

42:48.607 --> 42:49.608
Okay.

42:49.692 --> 42:51.944
I should get you home.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

42:54.238 --> 42:56.365
Yeah, please buckle up. Thank you.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.911
[engine starts]

43:06.458 --> 43:07.751
[knocking on door]

43:26.604 --> 43:27.605
Is Kat here?

43:38.991 --> 43:40.200
I'll be upstairs.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.843
I'm so sorry.

43:58.969 --> 43:59.887
I know.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.558
Can we still skate together?

44:05.517 --> 44:07.770
It can be like nothing ever happened.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.647
Except it won't, Kat.

44:11.273 --> 44:12.232
Not really.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.156
When did you stop taking your meds?

44:20.324 --> 44:23.661
Was it before the night when you wanted
to change our program before Regionals?

44:24.703 --> 44:25.829
What?

44:25.913 --> 44:27.915
'Cause that's the night
you said you loved me.

44:30.292 --> 44:31.669
Did you mean it, or...

44:34.129 --> 44:35.422
was it just a part of your mania?

44:35.839 --> 44:36.757
Justin...

44:37.174 --> 44:38.217
'Cause I meant it.

44:45.516 --> 44:46.600
I don't know.

44:48.602 --> 44:51.063
[Justin inhales deeply and sighs]

44:59.863 --> 45:01.990
[door opens]

45:02.074 --> 45:03.075
[door closes]
