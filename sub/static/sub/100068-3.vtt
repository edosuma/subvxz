WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:04.538
(bell dings)

00:05.506 --> 00:06.707
I love you.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.348
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.382 --> 00:16.784
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.854
DENNIS:
Okay, now put your arms back.

00:20.954 --> 00:22.923
You're like a... you're like
a rocket ship, okay?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.092
Now left.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.594
Now right. Now left. Now right.
Now go lower.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
-MAC: Oh, come on. Come...
-(Charlie whistles)
-Can you guys go lower?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.598
Dennis, is this
really necessary?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.866
Mac, you have
the tendon dexterity of a sow,

00:32.900 --> 00:35.103
so yes, it's necessary.
Guys, we're about to embark

00:35.203 --> 00:37.905
on the most important 24 hours
of our lives here.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.007
Okay, it's important
to stay limber and loose.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.409
Uh, yes. Very good, Charlie.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.911
-Can we just start?
-No, we can't just start, okay?

00:44.011 --> 00:45.779
Preparation is the key
to victory.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.415
-Oh.
-DENNIS: Yes, Charlie.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.649
You're really
nailing this today.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.017
I got my eye on you. Okay.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.353
Now, does everybody know
what they're supposed to do?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.755
Yes. Dennis, I know exactly
what you told us to do.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.357
I've memorized it.
I know where to be

00:56.390 --> 00:57.891
and when to be at all times.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.293
Okay, good. Yeah.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.761
Needy and
desperate for approval,

01:00.861 --> 01:02.430
but, uh, good. Charlie.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.931
-(blows)
-Now look at that. You see that?

01:04.031 --> 01:04.998
With one little gesture,

01:05.099 --> 01:06.567
he tells me
everything I need to know.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.736
That wordless display of
confidence earns my confidence.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.371
Don't. I did it already.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.605
You're so desperate.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.941
-I thought it was cool.
-Okay, now, listen. Guys, guys.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.310
We have exactly one day
to pull this off,

01:16.344 --> 01:19.247
so everything needs to be
executed to absolute perfection.

01:19.347 --> 01:23.284
And, gentlemen, if we do that,
well, the world is our oyster.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.018
Don't say "oyster." Say "clam."

01:25.119 --> 01:27.155
-The world's our clam?
-Yeah.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.822
-I like clams better.
-You like clams? Well,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.824
-that doesn't sound very good.
-They're both shellfish,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.826
-so it's kind of the same,
isn't it?
-Yeah. One's disgusting,

01:32.860 --> 01:35.196
-and one's delicious.
-Yeah, okay.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.165
-I personally prefer barnacles.
You know what I mean?
-MAC: Oh.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.466
-Yeah, there's
some meat in there.
-I like abalone.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.467
-DENNIS: Well, okay, guys.
-Abalone's interesting.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.034
-I'm a clam person.
-Seagulls...

01:41.135 --> 01:42.170
-Oh, mussels.
What about mussels?
-DENNIS: All right, guys.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.171
Let's not get into
a whole thing.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.172
We're getting derailed,
okay? Uh...

01:44.272 --> 01:45.506
We can spend
the whole day talking

01:45.539 --> 01:47.508
about which shell creatures
we do or don't prefer

01:47.608 --> 01:48.842
or enjoy at any given moment.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.110
That's not what
we're doing here.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.545
Okay, look, we put in the work.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.548
Right? We're ready.
We've done our dry run.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.983
And if we put our minds to it,

01:56.016 --> 01:59.187
nothing, absolutely nothing
can stand in our way.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.988
-World is our clam.
-Bring it in, boys.
-DEE: Oh!

02:01.021 --> 02:03.023
* Uh, Dee is in the house *

02:03.123 --> 02:05.058
* Uh, Dee is in the house,
uh, Dee is in the house *

02:05.159 --> 02:06.694
* Uh, Dee is in the house. *

02:06.727 --> 02:07.861
-First things first,
we got to ditch Dee.
-Oh, shit.

02:07.961 --> 02:08.862
-Yeah, let's ditch her.
-DEE: Guys,

02:08.961 --> 02:11.031
I am so excited to get started.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.366
Get started on what?

02:12.466 --> 02:14.668
Oh, my God. You forgot.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.171
(chuckles): Oh, that makes it
so much better.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.506
Oh, guys.

02:18.539 --> 02:21.041
From noon today
until noon tomorrow,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.710
it's Dee Day.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.011
-What?
-Oh, my God.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.145
-No.
-I completely forgot.
-Oh, shit.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.314
-No, I...
-No, wait, wait, wait.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.015
I know, I know.
See, we did all your days,

02:28.115 --> 02:29.350
and now it's my turn.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.252
So that means,
for the next 24 hours,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.086
you got to do everything
I tell you to do,

02:33.187 --> 02:34.422
and you got to listen to me.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.757
And you can't complain,
otherwise you're gonna get

02:36.857 --> 02:38.226
-one of these.
-(air horn blares)

02:38.326 --> 02:40.428
-(groans)
-And I tack another day on.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.196
-Dee, please,
please don't do this to us.
-Oh, you better

02:42.296 --> 02:44.097
cram your insults in now
while you got...

02:44.198 --> 02:45.766
oh, few more seconds left, guys.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.000
CHARLIE:
You... (stammers)

02:47.034 --> 02:49.136
-Dee's a bird!
-(frantic shouting)

02:49.169 --> 02:51.038
-Dee Day begins in three...
-Dee's a bird! You're a bird!

02:51.138 --> 02:52.406
-...two...
-You're a bird! (shouts)
-I hate you, bird!

02:52.506 --> 02:53.541
-You're a stupid...!
-...one.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.410
(clock chiming, cuckooing)

03:20.234 --> 03:22.035
As we all know, you guys just
love to talk and talk about

03:22.135 --> 03:25.105
why men this and why God that
and on and on and on and on.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.775
And I-I can't even begin
to count the number

03:27.875 --> 03:30.110
of pointless monologues
I've been forced to sit through.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.179
But not today. Today, it's you

03:32.212 --> 03:34.315
who will be forced to sit
and just listen.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.983
And my first topic?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.085
My feelings.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.753
-That's fair.
-MAC: Yeah, I'm into it.
-DEE: Thank you.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.088
-I'm excited.
-DEE: Thought you would be.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.823
Now, when I wake up
in the morning, I feel sad.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.292
And I feel sad
for a very long...

03:44.325 --> 03:45.759
DENNIS:
(groans) Today of all days,

03:45.859 --> 03:47.328
and now I'm being forced
to listen to her feelings?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.663
I won't do it. And who cares
about her feelings anyway?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.064
Nobody, that's who.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.667
What about my feelings?
Now, that's interesting, okay?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.769
Plus, the plan. We can't afford
to waste a second,

03:55.869 --> 03:57.705
and these pea-brains are
probably forgetting their parts

03:57.738 --> 03:59.807
with every second
that passes by.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.209
MAC:
Uh-oh. I'm forgetting
my part of the plan

04:02.242 --> 04:03.811
with every second that goes by.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.513
Dennis is gonna
yell at me again.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.015
Hey, why was Charlie
outshining me earlier?

04:08.115 --> 04:09.350
I mean, what's that all about?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.285
It's like he wants something
from Dennis.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.620
But what?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.822
Attention? Love?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.923
Why'd he throw me that look?
Does he want to replace me?

04:17.024 --> 04:20.093
Is that what's going on?
What the hell does he want?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.695
CHARLIE:
I'm pretty sure
Dennis has candy.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.331
I heard a crinkle in his pocket

04:23.431 --> 04:25.433
that sounded like
the wrapper of a candy.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.167
I gave Mac a look
to let him know

04:27.200 --> 04:29.202
that I figured out
Dennis has candy.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.204
Hopefully,
if we nail this plan,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.106
he'll give us some candy.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.175
I want that candy.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.844
FRANK:
You know who eats
raw shellfish?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.546
Seagulls, that's who.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.714
Clams you bake. Clams you fry.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.517
Pop a rubber band around them,
stuff them full of bread,

04:43.617 --> 04:45.553
boil them shits for an hour.

04:45.653 --> 04:48.522
There's a million ways
you can prepare a clam.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.058
"Make the world your clam."

04:51.158 --> 04:53.193
Just sounds better.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.662
And that, I believe,
is the reason

04:54.695 --> 04:56.497
for all of this
toxic masculinity.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.499
-Would you agree?
-Huh?

04:58.599 --> 05:00.000
-Yes.
-Yeah. Well...
-A-Absolutely.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.535
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Yeah. Everything...
-Absolutely.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.170
Everything you were saying,
we were totally listening.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.505
-That's totally true.
-DEE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.074
Okay, cool. Um, I'm gonna
go take a quick squirt

05:07.174 --> 05:08.509
'cause that beer
just went right through me,

05:08.609 --> 05:10.243
and then we'll move on
to the next thing.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.579
-Thanks, Dee.
-Sounds fun.
-All right, Dee.

05:11.679 --> 05:12.880
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah, Dee,
this is gonna be great.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.181
-I'm looking forward to it.
-This is really cool.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.516
-So excited. So excited.
-I'm enjoying this a lot.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.684
-Goddamn bird!
-(grunts)

05:16.784 --> 05:18.085
-I'm gonna...
-Where's the scream pillow?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.387
Yeah, yeah. No, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.221
Guys, wait. We can
still pull this thing off.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.322
We can still
pull this thing off.

05:22.356 --> 05:23.657
I-I just came up
with another plan.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.092
It was actually based on
what Dee just did.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.159
She just went to the bathroom.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.095
See, everybody's
got to take a dump

05:28.195 --> 05:29.997
at least once
in every 24-hour period.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.500
This got me thinking, right?
So, at some point today,

05:32.533 --> 05:34.902
each and every one of us
will have to take a shit, right?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.638
We're gonna have to go find
a bathroom, and at that point,

05:37.671 --> 05:40.207
you will go and execute
your part of the plan.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.742
-Sounds good. That's good.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.010
-See what I'm saying? All right.
-Yeah, yeah.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.412
So, Charlie, now it is time

05:44.512 --> 05:46.547
-for you to take your shit.
-CHARLIE: Is there time?

05:46.647 --> 05:48.081
-Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Okay, great. Nice.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.150
And then, Charlie, go poop,
and then we'll get started.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.719
What? No, that's not
what he's talking about, Mac.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.086
What he means
is that it's time for me

05:53.186 --> 05:54.422
to go to the school, break in

05:54.522 --> 05:56.223
using my old janitor's key,
right?

05:56.323 --> 05:57.491
Go into the nurse's office,

05:57.525 --> 05:58.926
'cause he's probably
still on his lunch break.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.227
Make the call. Call the valet.

06:00.327 --> 06:01.729
Let him know
that his kid's "sick"

06:01.829 --> 06:04.197
and needs to be
"picked up from school" ASAP.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.566
My man. With that kind of focus,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.200
we're gonna be able
to pull this thing off.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.936
-Yes!
-Way to go.
-Yeah! And then when he's there,

06:09.036 --> 06:10.504
-that's when he poops.
-Wrong!

06:10.538 --> 06:12.372
-Totally wrong.
Just go, Charlie. Go.
-CHARLIE: Okay.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.941
A-And keep this kind of
good focus in mind

06:14.041 --> 06:15.375
when it comes to
what's inside your pants,

06:15.409 --> 06:16.844
'cause I want that, man.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.746
Okay. Yeah. All right, great.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.014
-I want what's in your pants.
-DENNIS: No, no.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.082
-All right.
-(door opens)

06:22.182 --> 06:24.251
Okay. Where's Charlie?

06:24.351 --> 06:25.819
He had to take a shit.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.455
-(chuckles) Yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.490
-And I, too, have to take
a shit now, as well.
-Oh, what?

06:29.590 --> 06:30.691
No. What, now? No.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.626
Well, make up your mind,
or I-I do the horn.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.595
-Okay. It is a bit
of an emergency.
-No, it isn't.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.430
He-- You can, you can hold it.
He's gonna hold it.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.699
-(school bell ringing)
-CHARLIE: Knock, knock, knock.
-(door opens)

06:38.732 --> 06:40.834
Hey! How you doing, old Terry?

06:40.934 --> 06:42.269
Old buddy, old pal!

06:42.369 --> 06:44.805
-(laughs)
-Do I know you?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.140
Ah, come on, it's me!
It's Charlie! Remember?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.477
I used to be the janitor here
a few years back.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.679
Yeah, well, I got fired
on account of a relationship

06:51.779 --> 06:53.647
I was having with
a Juggalo child, you know.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.382
That's not the point.
The point is though

06:55.415 --> 06:57.017
I got my old job back.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.352
I'm ready to have new
relationships with the children.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.789
And in case you're wondering
how I got in the building,

07:01.822 --> 07:03.491
that's how.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.159
Oh.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.495
Right.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.962
And if memory serves,

07:08.996 --> 07:11.031
you usually take
your lunch break about now.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.166
So how about you pop on out,
eat some lunch,

07:13.266 --> 07:14.668
and I'll clean up your office.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.837
Oh, uh, I ate already.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.105
Did you?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.707
Lunch is at noon. It's 12:30.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.341
Oh, yeah. Look at that there.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.544
You know what happened though,
Terry, was I got a little

07:23.644 --> 07:25.513
held up on account of it
being Dee Day and all.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.848
-It's not D-Day.
-You know what?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.683
Actually, Terry,
I should tell you this.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.853
Um, I saw some kids breaking in
to your car outside.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.021
I ride a bike.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.355
Yeah. That's what I meant.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.190
They were breaking on in
to your bicycle.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.527
Kicked it in half.
Filled it with horse manure.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.029
-Kind of a prank, I guess.
-Yeah, I don't believe you.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.464
Well, only one way to find out.
Better pop outside, take a peek.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.036
My bike is fine.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.571
One step ahead of me,
aren't you, Terry?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.005
(chuckles):
Okay, you know what happened?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.007
Dee Day just threw
everything off, okay?

07:54.107 --> 07:55.843
So I'm just gonna
slide on in here.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.377
Maybe I'm gonna make
a little phone call.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.680
No big deal. And I'm not
gonna make a phone call.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.682
I'll just have
some candy, then.

08:01.782 --> 08:05.418
And I'm not gonna have any candy
'cause candy's for the kids.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.021
Terry, this has been
an unfortunate, uh...

08:08.121 --> 08:10.390
Hey, can I use your phone
and pretend to be you?

08:10.490 --> 08:11.692
No.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.027
Okay. That's strike three
on my, uh, count.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.863
Uh, I'm gonna
fuck your bike up, Terry.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.338
-What the hell is this?
-(Taiwanese accent):
Charlie, you would not

08:25.372 --> 08:27.474
-believe what we're doing.
-Oh, my God. What is that?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.010
(Puerto Rican accent):
Ladies just doing it for
themselves. I'm just playing.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.545
-I'm Martina Martinez.
-CHARLIE: Oh, no.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.681
You don't have to do the accent
anymore, Frank. You're offstage.

08:33.714 --> 08:36.015
-Oh, my God.
This is so racist, right?
-It's insanely racist.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.751
We didn't want to do it, but you
know, Dee's humor is so lowbrow.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.020
Oh, my God.
What is she...?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.688
Uh, she wants to do
a whole retrospective

08:41.722 --> 08:43.056
of her stupid characters.

08:43.155 --> 08:44.391
-Wrote a play about it.
-Her characters suck!

08:44.491 --> 08:45.525
-I know!
-Her characters suck!

08:45.626 --> 08:46.994
(Irish accent):
Charlie, thank God you're here.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.395
-Go get into costume.
We're up next.
-MAC: Dennis.

08:48.495 --> 08:49.663
Oh, Dennis, uh, you're offstage,

08:49.697 --> 08:50.864
so y-you don't have to do
the accent anymore.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.265
That's why you suck
at everything, Maxie.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.067
I say if you're gonna do
a racist stereotype,

08:54.167 --> 08:56.369
you best do it right. I mean,
that's a bit much, but you know.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.405
-Oh, uh, where are we
with the phone call?
-CHARLIE: Uh, no.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.040
I wasn't able to make it. I was
not able to make the call, guys.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.508
-What?!
-I'm sorry. Okay, look.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.510
Here's what we'll do. I'll-I'll
go to the valet myself, okay?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.212
I'll go to the restaurant.
I'll get the key.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.914
I-I can make it work, Dennis,
all right? Don't get mad.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.750
-Who's desperate now, Charlie?
-Shut up, Mac, you racist!

09:09.783 --> 09:11.952
I'm not racist! She's racist!
She's the one that's racist!

09:11.985 --> 09:13.320
-She's making us do it.
-DEE: Hey, turkeys!
-Shh. Shh.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.922
-What's the holdup in there?
-No, no, no, no. Goddamn it.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.724
Look, uh, you stay here,
Charlie.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.559
Um, Mac, Frank,
you go down there, okay?

09:19.660 --> 09:21.461
Um, you're not on again
till the second act.

09:21.494 --> 09:23.496
-I won't let you down, Dennis.
-Great. Go, go, go.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.998
-Go.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.900
-Oh, man.
-Charlie. Charlie,
go get into your costume.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.736
-We got to learn a song.
-What? A song?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.707
God.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.042
The glue on these teeth
is insane.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.310
I would never be able
to get them off and on in time.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.312
Ah, this makeup
is making me sick.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.049
-I'm-- I feel awful.
-It's not the makeup, Frank.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.685
It's the bag of clams you made
us stop before we came here.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.753
The clam is fine.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.220
If w-we got a bag of oysters,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.256
those would've made us
really sick.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.624
Whatever, dude.
Just focus, all right?

09:50.658 --> 09:52.159
The councilwoman's
gonna be here any second.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.161
Yeah, well,
what do we got to do now?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.829
Charlie screwed up
the whole thing with the valet.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.497
Now how are we gonna
get her keys?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.166
-All right, well, I got a plan.
-What?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.501
Now, when the valet
gets into the next car,

10:01.534 --> 10:02.836
I want you to go to your car,

10:02.870 --> 10:04.537
and I want you
to ram him, all right?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.674
Nothing crazy, but it's got
to be believable, all right?

10:06.707 --> 10:08.475
Then, I'll step in as the valet.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.143
I'll get
the councilwoman's keys.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.880
I'll go get a copy made.
I'll be back here ASAP.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.848
I have, I have a suggestion.
I mean, if you want...

10:14.882 --> 10:16.650
if you want it to be
really believable--

10:16.684 --> 10:19.352
the car accident--
then I think you should do it.

10:19.452 --> 10:23.691
I mean, I'm not saying out loud
why you should be the one

10:23.724 --> 10:28.028
to have the car accident, but I
think it would play much better.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.296
I do appreciate
that you're working

10:29.396 --> 10:30.831
on your prejudices, Frank.
I, too, am trying

10:30.864 --> 10:32.565
to become a better man and--
but I just--

10:32.666 --> 10:33.934
I-I-I really think
that, unfortunately,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.703
-it is a better plan.
-It's a good plan.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.805
So, uh, I'm just gonna
go ahead and do that.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.172
Oh! Oh!

10:39.272 --> 10:40.841
(whispering):
Okay. Okay, he's coming.
Oh, good.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.043
-You go get the keys.
I'm gonna go do the acc...
-Okay. (retches)

10:43.143 --> 10:44.344
-(groans)
-Are you okay?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.046
I'm-I'm... I'm just so sick.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.481
-This makeup is making me...
-(car door closes)

10:48.515 --> 10:50.317
-(guttural throat clearing)
-Okay.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.555
(gagging)

10:56.890 --> 10:59.426
(continues gagging)

10:59.526 --> 11:00.994
Hello there.
I'm the valet.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.229
I'll take your car.
(gags)

11:02.329 --> 11:04.497
-Oh, are you okay?
-Oh, yeah.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.234
I'm-I'm... I'm fine.
I'm aces. It's just...

11:07.334 --> 11:10.037
It's just that I got
a little skin thing going on.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.505
But I-I... I may get sick,
but it won't be clams.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.342
It won't be the clams, because
if it was clams... (gags)

11:15.375 --> 11:18.178
...clams and I was sick, it
would be all over the pavement.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.880
-(gagging)
-Uh, uh, I'm sorry,
but is there someone else

11:19.980 --> 11:21.381
-that can take my car from me?
-No. No.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.383
-He's gone.
He had a car accident.
-An accident?

11:23.483 --> 11:24.985
-Oh, my God. Oh, geez.
-Yeah.
-(tires squealing)

11:25.018 --> 11:27.054
-(loud crash)
-Oh. Oh.
-Yeah, there it is.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.688
-That was it. Yeah.
-God. Um...
-(car alarm sounding)

11:28.789 --> 11:29.990
(retching loudly)

11:30.023 --> 11:31.391
(Frank grunts)

11:31.491 --> 11:33.226
-It's not the clams!
-Oh! Uh, yeah.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.395
I'm telling you,
it can't be the clams!

11:35.495 --> 11:37.731
It don't make no sense!
No, don't go.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.734
-(retching)
-(tires squealing)

11:40.834 --> 11:43.303
It's not the clams!

11:44.704 --> 11:46.373
(old man voice):
* For the love of God *

11:46.473 --> 11:49.542
* Paddy, don't you see? *

11:49.642 --> 11:54.848
* Your love is all
I ever wanted to be... *

11:54.882 --> 11:55.949
-"For me," idiot.
-Uh...

11:56.049 --> 11:57.885
* Wanted for me.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.286
Ha.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.288
Okay. Then you do the...

12:01.321 --> 12:02.923
(sighs)
Do we have to?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.391
Yeah, I mean. Yeah.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.725
Well, I don't know.
Did you want the horn?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.594
(Charlie sighs)

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
(quietly):
Let's just get it over with.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.565
Plant one on me, Covington!

12:12.665 --> 12:14.634
(quietly):
Goddamn it. Yeah.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.839
Yeah. (chuckles)

12:18.939 --> 12:21.174
Yeah, I-I'm looking here
in the script,

12:21.274 --> 12:22.810
and it says that they kiss,

12:22.843 --> 12:25.678
"with the quivering lips
of two souls desperate

12:25.779 --> 12:27.948
to taste the juices of passion."

12:29.682 --> 12:31.618
Did that seem like that
to you guys?

12:31.718 --> 12:34.387
-No.
-No.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.024
No, me, neither.
Okay. So do that, then.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.625
-(beep)
-(Irish accent): Gladly.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.094
("Endless Love" by Lionel Richie
and Diana Ross playing)

12:43.030 --> 12:45.165
* My love *

12:46.867 --> 12:52.005
-* There's only you in my life *
-(moaning)

12:52.039 --> 12:55.542
* The only thing
that's bright... *

12:57.344 --> 12:58.611
(giggles):
Yeah.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.013
Wow!

13:00.047 --> 13:01.614
(chuckles):
Okay.

13:01.714 --> 13:05.018
Very nice.
Way better than I was expecting.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.187
(beep, song stops)

13:07.220 --> 13:08.621
Goddamn bitch.

13:08.721 --> 13:10.190
(both spitting)

13:10.223 --> 13:11.859
-Goddamn bitch.
-She's sick is what she is.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.460
-Yeah, she's sick.
-That's a sick person
right there.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.295
And I know we're supposed to be
cool with this, 'cause, like,

13:15.395 --> 13:16.796
that's where society's headed,
but I'm just-- I'm not there.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.531
-I'm not saying it's not right.
-I'm not ready. I'm not ready.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.000
I'm saying I don't want to
do it. I don't want to do it.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.501
What did you eat? Why am I
getting a weird taste...

13:21.534 --> 13:23.603
-I had cheese. I thought--
Well, I wanted...
-(groans)

13:23.636 --> 13:25.038
Well, now you know
how it feels.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.673
Oh, I don't want to taste
your cheese. It's weird...

13:26.773 --> 13:27.908
Well, I didn't want
to taste your cheese, either.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.843
-(spitting, groaning)
-(Mac exhales)

13:29.943 --> 13:32.179
-Hey. How'd it go
with the valet?
-We, uh, we struck out.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.314
-You what?!
-No good...
-Well, how are we gonna get

13:34.347 --> 13:35.382
in the woman's apartment
without her key?

13:35.482 --> 13:36.583
We got to get in that apartment.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.018
We got to set
that woman's clocks back.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.686
-DENNIS: What's going on
with him?
-Clams.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.354
-Where'd you get clams?
-Did you eat bad clams, Frank?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.523
-No, don't.
-DEE: Hey, guys.
Ticktock back there!

13:43.556 --> 13:44.858
(groans) All right, just go
finish the goddamn show.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.593
-Yeah, by the way,
she made us kiss.
-Yeah.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.361
-She made us kiss.
-I'm not doing that.
I'm not doing that.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.429
All right,
let's just get out there.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.864
I don't want to be
doing this all week.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.233
-Hey, you guys really did kiss?
-Yeah, but don't get excited.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.667
-That's not fair.
-But we didn't like it.

13:54.701 --> 13:56.069
-Just go.
-Dennis, you should
come out with us.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.370
-No, no, no.
-Get out! Just go
and finish the show.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.073
-Finish the show, all right?
-I'm not kissing you.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.508
-Okay.
-(Frank sighs)

14:01.541 --> 14:04.411
So, in this scene, Martina
enters Tammy's massage parlor

14:04.444 --> 14:06.413
looking for a full-body rubdown.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.415
-What?!
-Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.017
And like all great plays,

14:10.117 --> 14:12.552
this one is going to have
a happy ending.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.023
Yeah, that was clams.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.495
Oh, nothing like a day
of bird-watching.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.697
So peaceful. So relaxing.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.699
-Wouldn't you agree?
-Huh? Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.035
-Really calming.
-And, yeah, it's, uh...

14:28.068 --> 14:29.736
-It's great.
-Birds are m-majestical.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.171
Ooh, fun bird fact.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.706
The ostrich's eyes are bigger
than its brain.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.043
-Huh.
-Do you have
any thoughts on that?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.710
-That's... cool.
-Good.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.247
-FRANK: Great bird.
-It's a good bird.
-Ostriches are good birds.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.682
Well, unfortunately,
I have to take another piss.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.051
-I'll be back.
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.452
See ya, Dee.
We're just gonna look at...

14:45.552 --> 14:46.753
look for some more birds
that we love.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.121
-Yeah, we'll keep on, uh...
-Yeah, just gonna...

14:48.155 --> 14:51.024
Oh, my God, I want to scream
"bird," I want to scream "bird."

14:51.058 --> 14:52.692
-I want to scream, "Bird! Bird!"
-That would be so good.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.427
-Do you want me to do it
for you, Dennis?
-No.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.263
Don't do it. She's probably
hiding behind a tree.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.864
Yeah. What's going on with you?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.566
Why are you
so off your game today?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.568
Well, I-- Charlie has been
outshining me all day,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.803
and I want to shine for you,
Dennis, so I'm just...

15:03.836 --> 15:05.472
I haven't been outshining you.
I was just throwing you looks

15:05.505 --> 15:08.075
because I wanted the candy, but
I was gonna share it with you.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.710
-What candy?
-Dennis has candy in his pocket.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.845
-Okay, guys, can we get back
to talking about the plan?
-You have candy?

15:12.946 --> 15:14.147
Look, w-we're getting
off track here.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.582
-Dennis has candy?
-CHARLIE: I heard it crinkle.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.950
-Yeah, I want that candy, man.
-DENNIS: Yes, I have candy.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.651
All right?
Of course I have candy.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.187
I keep candy
in my pocket sometimes

15:20.287 --> 15:21.721
so that I can get
Charlie's focus.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.922
It was working
like a charm, man.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.857
I was zoned in on everything
you were saying.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.960
Yes, I know it was working; the
whole goddamn thing was working

15:27.060 --> 15:29.262
till Dee came through
with this Dee Day bullshit.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.364
Are we gonna get the candy,
or are you gonna keep it

15:31.464 --> 15:33.466
-in your pocket all day?
-I'll have some candy.
-Here's the candy.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.168
-Yeah! Yes, I knew it.
-Oh, oh, oh! I want...

15:35.268 --> 15:36.169
All right, all right.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.338
-Wow.
-Children. Children.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.673
-Good candy, good candy.
-This is good candy.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.841
I don't need the candy
anymore anyway,

15:41.941 --> 15:43.010
'cause I have a backup plan.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.711
We don't need
the councilwoman's keys anymore

15:44.811 --> 15:46.813
to get into her house,
because we have me. All right?

15:46.846 --> 15:48.481
So I'll peel off.
I'll go seduce her.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.183
She'll invite me into her house,

15:50.217 --> 15:52.685
where I'll bang her as fast
as I possibly can, and then,

15:52.719 --> 15:53.686
while she's cleaning up
afterwards,

15:53.720 --> 15:54.954
I'll set all of her clocks back,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.224
causing her to sleep late
and miss the boat, okay?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.691
So when Dee comes back,
just tell her

15:58.725 --> 16:01.028
-I had to go take my shit.
-CHARLIE: Nice, man. All right.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.529
-Watch out!
-Hey.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.831
-Hey.
-Where you rushing off to?

16:04.864 --> 16:06.866
-Oh, I-I got to take a shit.
-Do ya?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.535
-Yeah.
-Okay. I'll let you do that.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.170
-Okay.
-But real quick first.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.804
I wanted to do something
with you.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.641
-I really have to shit, Dee.
-Yeah, this'll be fast.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.543
-What is that?
-Oh, these are makeup wipes.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.378
So that you can remove
your makeup.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.380
(chuckles) Makeup?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.015
I'm not wearing any makeup.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.683
Then it won't be an issue.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.154
I mean, I'm wearing
a little bit of concealer.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.888
Is that what you're talking
about having me remove?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.223
Well, I'm talking about
the concealer, yes.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.824
But I'm talking about
the rest of the makeup,

16:31.858 --> 16:33.660
the tape you have
behind your jaw and your eyes.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.727
I'm talking about
the hair paint.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.029
I'm talking about all of it.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.570
DEE:
What a nice restaurant this is,

16:43.670 --> 16:46.206
filled with attractive,
professional-looking people.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.508
You know what it is?
It's the kind of place

16:48.541 --> 16:51.844
where you wouldn't want
to stick out like a sore thumb.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.546
How are you liking it, Dennis?

16:55.082 --> 16:56.349
Yes, very nice.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.850
-Yeah?
-(chuckles) Yes.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.553
Would you like to go introduce
yourself to some ladies?

17:00.653 --> 17:03.223
No, uh, I-I'm okay. Uh, no.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.425
Okay. I'll go round some up
and bring them to you.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.659
-No.
-Yep.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.560
Hey, don't mind her, dude.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.695
Y-You look great.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.732
Holy shit. That's her.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.567
-Who?
-The councilwoman.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.902
-She's right there.
-CHARLIE: Who? Right there?

17:16.002 --> 17:17.569
-Right there. That's her.
-Right there? Oh, shit.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.872
-Oh, my God, this is incredible.
What are the odds?
-That's her, yeah.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.540
Dee has no idea
how good this is for us.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.542
-Dennis, go do your thing.
-This is great.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.545
(stammers):
No, I-I...

17:25.645 --> 17:27.214
-I can't. No.
-Buddy,

17:27.247 --> 17:29.015
makeup or not,
you are the Golden God.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.583
It's all about what's in here.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.952
Oh. Is your pec deflated?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.554
Sh-She took his pads out.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.123
-Yeah, he had...
-Oh, your pec pads.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.325
-He had some pads.
-No.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.128
Well, either way, man, you can
do it. You're our only hope.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.362
-I can do this.
-Yes.
-Yeah.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.963
-Yeah, it's worth a shot.
-Yeah!

17:43.996 --> 17:45.465
-That's the attitude.
-Come on, man.
-You're looking good.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.267
You got it.
You got this. You got this.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.236
-You got this. You got this.
-Go, go, go, go, go.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.604
-He ain't got this.
-That's what
his soul looks like.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.983
DENNIS:
Hi.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.018
Did I frighten you?

18:06.119 --> 18:07.687
Sorry.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.757
Uh, I'm not, I'm not, uh...
I'm Dennis.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.762
Do you like hard candy?

18:15.862 --> 18:18.398
I have candies.
Oh, you know what?

18:18.431 --> 18:20.933
Actually, I don't.
Scratch that. I...

18:21.033 --> 18:24.337
I threw all the hard candies
at those idiot children.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.206
Uh...

18:26.306 --> 18:28.040
Oysters or clams?

18:28.141 --> 18:30.843
-Excuse me?
-Oysters, obviously.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.446
(chuckles) You know?

18:33.546 --> 18:35.682
-Mm.
-Plus, like, they-they--

18:35.782 --> 18:37.284
You can, you can get sick
off clams.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.286
Like, I got real sick off clams
when I was, like...

18:40.520 --> 18:42.021
Anything can make you throw up

18:42.054 --> 18:44.557
if you're, if you're, uh...
if it's gone bad.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.526
You know, my dad was, like,
throwing up off--

18:46.626 --> 18:48.361
He's not really my dad,
but you know.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.363
Yeah.

18:50.397 --> 18:52.532
But anyway, it's oysters for me.
(chuckles)

18:52.565 --> 18:54.033
-(clears throat softly)
-Um...

18:54.133 --> 18:55.535
Hey, uh, you know what?
I just realized.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.237
We don't have a lot of time,
so let's--

18:57.337 --> 18:59.472
We should get this over with.
Can I get your house key?

18:59.572 --> 19:00.673
-What?
-We don't,

19:00.707 --> 19:02.475
uh, have to have sex like this.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.044
I can, I can... I can put
another man's face on.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.380
If you give me your house key,
I can go to your house

19:07.480 --> 19:08.681
and put on
some of your makeup...

19:08.781 --> 19:10.517
-Get away from me.
-Well, hold on a second.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.420
Um, uh, we-- I'm supposed to be
taking a shit right now.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.222
-And so-- Yeah.
-Dennis.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.856
What are you doing
to this woman?

19:16.956 --> 19:18.525
Uh, it was my turn
to take a shit,

19:18.625 --> 19:21.027
and then I was
gonna do it with her.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.729
I am so sorry about him. Okay?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.197
This man is clearly a monster,

19:24.231 --> 19:25.665
and he will be punished
accordingly.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.166
G-Go wait for me over there,
monster.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.335
We'll find another woman.

19:29.602 --> 19:30.837
It's Dee Day.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.408
CHARLIE:
Just so you know, you look...

19:35.508 --> 19:38.211
a lot better now,
but you looked fine.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.513
I just don't look good when
I haven't got enough sleep.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.749
And I got a little nap in,
so, you know, I'm back.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.317
-Huh.
-Anyway,

19:44.351 --> 19:46.419
I bet you the city council's
voted already.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.488
-Dying to figure out
which way they voted.
-MAC: Oh, dude.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.490
It doesn't matter. Like, the
bird bitch ruined everything.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.825
-We had a plan. We had...
-Shh. Keep your voice down.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.927
We may have lost this one,
but the most important thing

19:55.027 --> 19:56.829
is that we don't get
another Dee Day.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.732
Oh, man. That's, like,
the 20th piss I took today.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.200
-Oh, yeah?
-Well, hey, it's important

20:01.234 --> 20:02.769
-to stay hydrated.
-Yeah.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.871
Knock it off. Looks like
you guys are gonna make it.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.740
And I have to say, I am very
impressed that you were able

20:07.840 --> 20:10.843
to focus on anything other than
yourselves for one entire day.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.845
-Well, Dee,
it's been a real pleasure.
-CHARLIE: Uh, we haven't

20:12.879 --> 20:14.914
-made it yet, so...
-FRANK: We've enjoyed it.
-It's been really great.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.384
And Dee Day ends officially in

20:17.417 --> 20:20.219
three, two, one.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.754
-(clock chiming, cuckooing)
-(Frank sighs)

20:21.854 --> 20:23.390
All right, let me have it.
Pile it on me.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.358
-News.
-Pile it on me.
-TV. TV. Yeah, put the...

20:25.392 --> 20:27.026
-Channel 7. Channel 7.
-Put the news on.
Put the news on.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.361
-What are you doing?
-What channel? What channel?

20:28.395 --> 20:29.762
-S-Seven? Seven?
-Yeah, it might be.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.764
-(news theme plays)
-In a stunning upset,

20:31.864 --> 20:34.801
local ordinance LC-103
passed today.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.469
The controversial proposal

20:36.503 --> 20:39.872
actually legalizes
public urination.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.608
-It passed! It passed!
-(excited yelling)
-It passed! It passed!

20:41.708 --> 20:42.609
It passed!

20:42.709 --> 20:44.377
-(men cheering, laughing)
-Oh!

20:44.411 --> 20:45.778
-It passed anyway.
-Nice!

20:45.878 --> 20:46.979
What passed?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.715
Dee, we have been
working for weeks

20:48.748 --> 20:50.049
on a very intricate plan

20:50.082 --> 20:51.451
to ensure the passage
of that ordinance.

20:51.551 --> 20:53.320
Yeah. All we had to do was
stop one city councilwoman

20:53.353 --> 20:54.921
-from voting, that was it.
-Yeah, yeah. So we had

20:55.021 --> 20:56.756
this ingenious plan to, uh,
get ahold of her keys,

20:56.856 --> 20:58.525
sneak into her house and, uh,
turn all of her clocks back,

20:58.625 --> 21:00.593
-mess with her phones
a little bit or whatever...
-It was a good plan.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.662
...so that she would sleep too
late, she would miss the vote,

21:02.695 --> 21:05.765
-and the ordinance would pass,
and it passed!
-(Dennis and Charlie laugh)

21:05.865 --> 21:07.300
We knew that she would be
the one dissenting vote.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.435
-So we had to stop her.
-Yeah.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.869
-How?
-Oh, well, it's a group--

21:09.969 --> 21:11.504
-Uh, well, yeah.
-There it is.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.139
CHARLIE: It's all men
and she was the one lady.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.707
-MAC: Men are free once again...
-FRANK: We are free!

21:14.807 --> 21:17.009
...to relieve themselves
where God intended.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.311
You guys are idiots!

21:18.345 --> 21:20.179
That's the most ludicrous thing
I've ever even heard.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.181
Why didn't you just go
and slash her tires, like,

21:22.214 --> 21:24.016
five minutes before she had
to leave for the meeting?

21:24.116 --> 21:25.785
-Oh. Oh.
-What? Oh, yeah, just do that.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.354
-(laughing)
-Okay, yeah, just do that.
-Yeah, sure.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.155
Dee, you know what?
You don't get it. Okay?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.358
Women will never understand
what it's like to be a man.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.060
Like, we just, like, we need
to piss in public, okay?

21:34.160 --> 21:37.397
-We need to hatch plans
(laughs) that actually work.
-(Charlie laughing)

21:37.497 --> 21:39.699
Dee, your plan
would not have worked.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.502
Oh, yeah?
My plan did work, jackass.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.737
I got close enough to the
councilwoman in the restaurant

21:44.837 --> 21:46.739
to steal her wallet,
got her address,

21:46.839 --> 21:48.541
and then replaced the wallet
without her seeing.

21:48.575 --> 21:50.142
And then,
in the middle of the night

21:50.176 --> 21:52.311
when I told you guys
I was going to "take a shit"

21:52.345 --> 21:54.313
like you were doing
all goddamn day,

21:54.347 --> 21:56.683
I snuck over
and I slashed her tires.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.318
You did? Why?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.187
Did you see how many times
I peed today?

22:01.287 --> 22:02.589
I have a teeny, tiny,
little bladder.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.824
I want to be able to pee
on the street if I have to.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.726
-Oh! You?
-Ugh! Gross.
-In front of us?

22:06.826 --> 22:08.361
-Just out there in the public?
-A woman?
-Squat?

22:08.461 --> 22:09.696
-Dee, you nasty.
-DENNIS: Nasty.

22:09.796 --> 22:12.064
-Dee, you n...
-(laughs): She's so nasty.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.200
No, you know what?
You guys are just pissed

22:14.300 --> 22:16.403
-because I outsmarted you.
-Oh, you outsmarted us?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.738
-You're embarrassed.
-Dee, (chuckles) you spent
the entirety of Dee Day

22:18.838 --> 22:20.607
coming up with a plan
that eventually led

22:20.707 --> 22:23.042
to us getting exactly
what we want, so...

22:23.142 --> 22:24.677
-We scored.
-You're a stupid bird.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.379
Don't even bother trying
to explain it to her.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.014
Her tiny bird brain
will never get it.

22:28.047 --> 22:29.449
DENNIS:
Birds don't understand plans.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.550
What about this one?
Dee's a bird.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.751
-(laughs)
-That's a good one.

22:31.784 --> 22:32.852
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.353
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.423
You should all probably
check your phones.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.157
-DENNIS and CHARLIE: Why?
-Oh, I don't know.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.060
Just 'cause I pushed
the cuckoo clock ahead an hour.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.061
(clock chimes)

22:42.161 --> 22:44.263
No. Shut up.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.232
Here's the problem, guys.

22:46.332 --> 22:50.202
You just insulted me
on Dee Day.

22:50.302 --> 22:52.204
-No.
-No, no, no, no. God.
-Oh, no, wait...

22:52.304 --> 22:53.873
You know what that earns you?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.341
Another day of Dee.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.876
-Oh, no!
-No, no, no, no, no!
-(shouting)

22:56.976 --> 22:59.078
-(air horn blaring)
-(yelling)

22:59.178 --> 23:03.082
-* I... *
-* I... *

23:03.182 --> 23:05.785
* I want to share *

23:05.885 --> 23:09.622
* All my love *

23:09.722 --> 23:12.859
* With you *

23:12.892 --> 23:17.229
* No one else will do *

23:18.765 --> 23:20.667
* And your eyes *

23:20.767 --> 23:23.302
* Your eyes, your eyes *

23:23.335 --> 23:28.975
* They tell me
how much you care *

23:29.008 --> 23:31.110
* Oh, yes. *

23:35.247 --> 23:38.184

23:41.320 --> 23:43.322

23:50.797 --> 23:53.132

24:05.311 --> 24:08.014
I think I'd make
a great drag queen.
Like, for real.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.718
But the one time I tried it,
I looked so much like my mom,
it scared me.

24:11.818 --> 24:13.385
And I was sexy as hell.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.055
