MOSLEY: Spencer Williams
and I had a child,

00:05.657 --> 00:07.485
and when he fled the country,
he took my boy.

00:07.529 --> 00:08.878
I'm gonna go
get that kid,

00:08.921 --> 00:10.619
and I'm gonna bring
him back to his mom.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.055
Let's go.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.187
You Arlo Turk?

00:13.230 --> 00:14.927
I am, and you are?Friends of Hetty.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.886
Let's figure out what's best
for our son.

00:16.929 --> 00:17.887
No.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.283
Stay down.All right, we got him.
We're out of here.

Oh, yeah, no, I-I-I believe you.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.252
You should try it.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.818
I know what coconut tastes like.Come on.

02:46.862 --> 02:47.993
For real, just try it.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.212
I don't need to try
it to-- Baby, ah.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.040

Oh, my God, it's so, so good.Huh? Mmm.

So... tasty.

I just want to...

02:58.874 --> 03:00.354
Whoa.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what did you just do?

03:02.269 --> 03:03.792
What do you mean,
what did I just do?

03:03.835 --> 03:05.228
I ta-- I tasted it.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.883
It is cake. It is not wine.
You don't spit it out.

03:07.926 --> 03:09.711
You do if your blood sugar's
about to redline.

03:09.754 --> 03:11.843
Are you kidding me? I'm gonna
spend the rest of the day

03:11.887 --> 03:13.149
sweating out Skittles. I'm done.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.283
Well, you better
get your act together

03:16.326 --> 03:17.762
because we have
four more to go.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.242
Four more?
Yeah.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.636
I'm gonna die. Why can't you
just pick out what you like?

03:21.679 --> 03:22.941
I want to know
what you like.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.595
I like when
you choose.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.944
Well, that's not fair,
you have to participate.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.381
I am participating.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.992
I'm about to go into a
sugar coma to pick out something

03:30.035 --> 03:31.167
that ultimately
doesn't even matter.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.603
What?

03:32.647 --> 03:35.693
I'm sorry, our-our wedding cake
doesn't matter?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.217
No. No, no.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.044
That's not what
I'm saying. I mean,

03:39.088 --> 03:41.003
symbolically, yeah,
but realistically, no.

03:41.046 --> 03:44.267
No, because if people really
liked wedding cake that much,

03:44.311 --> 03:45.703
it would be available
everywhere.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.270
You could go in and get it
off a dessert menu.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.489
You could walk into Starbucks
and be, like,

03:48.532 --> 03:50.534
"Yeah, Randy,
give me that latte

03:50.578 --> 03:51.840
and a-a slice of
the wedding cake."

03:51.883 --> 03:53.711
You know why
it's not?
Why?

03:53.755 --> 03:56.758
Because people don't like
wedding cake.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.760
Brownies, yeah.
People love brownies.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.065
Rice Krispie treats?

04:00.109 --> 04:01.893
Ugh, those are the best things
in the planet.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.939
Apple pie?
You betcha.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.593
Wedding cake? Ah...

04:05.636 --> 04:08.073
Be quiet and don't spit it out.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.119
: Okay.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.604
Oh, my God, is that,
is that mango?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.432
Baby, this is delicious.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.048
You following me?

04:30.139 --> 04:33.185
No, but I have been
looking for you.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.186
Mm.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.840
Or, more specifically, her.

04:35.884 --> 04:38.626
Where is she?
Hetty?

04:38.669 --> 04:41.281
No, Cher.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.284
Last I heard, she was in Vegas.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.982
I was sorry to hear about Sonny.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.943
I don't know about Hetty.

04:51.987 --> 04:54.206
When was the last time
you talked to her?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.947
Couple months ago.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.732
Where did you see her last?

05:00.387 --> 05:03.955
Outside that hospital,
Los Mochis.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.349
Hetty was in Los Mochis?

05:06.393 --> 05:09.700
With you?

05:09.744 --> 05:12.050
Of course she was.

05:16.011 --> 05:16.968
You haven't seen her since?

05:17.012 --> 05:19.971
No.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.364
She didn't come back with you?

05:21.408 --> 05:24.846
She said she wanted
to see the country.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.936
ERIC: Yeah, no, I appreciate
that. It's just that

05:27.979 --> 05:31.113
I'm gonna be asked these
very same questions, so...

05:31.156 --> 05:32.941
You know what, they don't
normally respond to that,

05:32.984 --> 05:35.117
but I will pass on the request.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.336
What's that about?

05:36.379 --> 05:38.163
LAPD is requesting
Callen and Sam

05:38.207 --> 05:40.601
to report to the scene
of an MVA.
Why?

05:40.644 --> 05:41.950
Apparently, it's sensitive.

05:41.993 --> 05:45.432
Oh. Maybe Deeks can
help us out with that.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.391
Admiral.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.176
Technical Operator Eric Beale

05:51.220 --> 05:53.875
and Intelligence Analyst
Nell Jones,

05:53.918 --> 05:55.529
Deputy Director Ochoa.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.400
To what do owe
the pleasure?

05:57.444 --> 05:59.620
I'm afraid there's
nothing pleasurable

05:59.663 --> 06:01.665
about this visit,
Miss Jones.

06:01.709 --> 06:05.800
This is John Rogers from
the Department of Justice.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.063
Where's Executive
Assistant Director Mosley?

06:18.856 --> 06:20.728
You're back.

06:20.771 --> 06:22.730
I'm back.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.089
How'd you make out
with Hetty in Washington?

06:34.132 --> 06:36.352
I didn't even see Hetty
in Washington,

06:36.396 --> 06:38.223
so that should
tell you something.

06:38.267 --> 06:41.531
I wouldn't read
too much into it.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.359
Yeah.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.665
How's Derrick?

06:44.708 --> 06:47.798
Derrick is good.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.018
Actually, he's amazing.
We're, um,

06:50.061 --> 06:54.196
getting to know one another
again as mother and son.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.545
Glad to hear it.

06:55.589 --> 06:59.027
He misses his father.

06:59.070 --> 07:01.899
Not much I can do about that.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.988
You did what you needed to do
to protect him.

07:06.164 --> 07:09.167
It wasn't gonna end well for him

07:09.211 --> 07:10.778
if he stayed with his father.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.954
We both know that.

07:12.997 --> 07:16.653
Hm, yeah, we both know that.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.220
If he ever wants to

07:18.263 --> 07:21.963
spend a day on the water,

07:22.006 --> 07:24.792
I could always use another set
of hands on my boat.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.490
Thank you.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
I actually think
he would like that.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.190
This is, um...

07:32.234 --> 07:36.499
This is harder than I thought
it would ever be, Sam.

07:36.543 --> 07:40.155
Nothing of value comes
without effort.

07:40.198 --> 07:43.506
Yeah, I-I think I thought
we would just go back

07:43.550 --> 07:45.813
to the way things
used to be between us.

07:45.856 --> 07:49.599
Oh, you'll get there.
Give it some time.

07:49.643 --> 07:53.342
I've already lost
a lot of time with him.

07:53.385 --> 07:54.735
The past is gone,

07:54.778 --> 07:57.128
there's nothing we can do
to change that.

07:57.172 --> 08:01.045
All we have now is the present
and the future.

08:01.089 --> 08:04.745
It's what you do with them
that matters the most now.

08:04.788 --> 08:05.789
Yeah.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.271
What's the matter?

08:09.314 --> 08:13.754
Deputy Director Ochoa
is here to see you

08:13.797 --> 08:16.365
and he's brought
a special prosecutor.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.252
This can't be good if they
brought in a special prosecutor.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.341
CALLEN: Why didn't Hetty
give us a heads

08:36.385 --> 08:39.431
Probably because she didn't know
this was coming.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.826
I don't suppose
any of you know

08:42.870 --> 08:44.567
where she is?

08:48.092 --> 08:50.225
She trained you well.

08:50.268 --> 08:54.316
Ew. What the hell--
Is this flavored coffee?

08:54.359 --> 08:56.840
Cinnamon Surprise. Don't worry,
it's, uh, fair trade

08:56.884 --> 09:00.061
and sustainably harvested,
cage-free.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.279
Cinnamon.And you wonder why

09:01.323 --> 09:03.630
the rest of the country
hates California.

09:03.673 --> 09:06.154
Wait, is that true?

09:06.197 --> 09:07.634
How do you think Mosley's
gonna play this?

09:07.677 --> 09:09.723
She'll do the
right thing.
For who?

09:09.766 --> 09:11.812
KILBRIDE:
Yeah, I see you, too,

09:11.855 --> 09:13.204
you beady-eyed bastard.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.032
I take it you know that guy.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.730
Unfortunately.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.080
DEEKS: I take it
you're not besties?

09:19.123 --> 09:20.429
KILBRIDE:
Well,

09:20.472 --> 09:22.649
he doesn't like me,
but he really hates Hetty.

09:22.692 --> 09:24.781
Oh, that's a real
confidence builder.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.609
Um, just so we're all
on the same page,

09:26.653 --> 09:29.177
what should my level of panic
be at this point?

09:29.220 --> 09:31.353
I'd say, on the panic spectrum,
some place between

09:31.396 --> 09:34.530
mild apprehension
and blind hysteria.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.273
I can do that.
Uh, we have a case, I think.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.535
LAPD wants Callen and Sam

09:39.579 --> 09:41.450
to come to a motor vehicle
collision site,

09:41.493 --> 09:42.669
but they won't say why.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.148
Well, I love
a mystery.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.454
What do you
want us to do?

09:45.497 --> 09:47.848
You read lips, don't you?

09:49.327 --> 09:50.677
Terrible gift to waste.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.593
Okay.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.075
So, undercover again, huh?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.904
What are you supposed
to be this time,

10:00.948 --> 10:03.124
one of the von Trapp children?

10:03.167 --> 10:06.040
Oh, uh, my wardrobe. Yeah.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.259
It's a funny story,
actually, um,

10:08.303 --> 10:10.871
but I am needed in Ops,

10:10.914 --> 10:13.438
so, uh, th-there's-- I'm...

10:16.528 --> 10:19.314
ROGERS: At what point did you
alert your agency

10:19.357 --> 10:22.273
about your involvement
with Spencer Williams?

10:22.317 --> 10:24.232
Do I really
have to answer that?

10:24.275 --> 10:25.581
No.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.452
ROGERS: Refusing to
answer only makes you

10:27.496 --> 10:30.020
look more guilty, especially
in a congressional hearing,

10:30.064 --> 10:31.892
not to mention
the court of public opinion.

10:31.935 --> 10:33.763
Okay, don't get ahead
of yourself, Counselor.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.591
You're only here on
a fact-finding mission.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.986
So, then, tell me the facts,
EAD Mosley,

10:39.029 --> 10:41.466
about your relationship
with Spencer Williams.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.294
What relevance does that have?

10:43.338 --> 10:45.819
You had a son
with a known arms dealer.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.258
Yeah, some might see that
as operational commitment.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.914
ROGERS: I'm
glad you can

10:53.957 --> 10:55.959
still find some humor in this,
Deputy Director.

10:56.003 --> 10:59.223
I just hope your people
have their stories straight.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.836
Well, I tend to find that the
best stories are the true ones.

11:04.968 --> 11:08.145
When did you first tell
this office of your situation?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.626
I'm sorry, what situation
are you speaking of?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.411
That you considered your son
the victim of kidnapping?

11:13.455 --> 11:17.154
He wasa kidnapping victim.
That's been well-documented.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.680
Enter.

11:20.723 --> 11:24.858
A Mrs. Patricia Lexington
is here to see you.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.381
Let her in.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.383
I'm sorry,
who are we letting in?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.341
My attorney.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.822
If you will excuse me,
gentlemen.

11:43.528 --> 11:46.531
Nice tie. Is that Zara?

11:47.881 --> 11:49.534
KENSI:
Oh, snap.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.406
What?Well, Mosley just lawyered up.

11:51.449 --> 11:53.016
Oh, that's a double snap.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.236
Okay. Now Rogers is alone
with the deputy director.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.020
Okay-- sorry.Mm-mm. Oh, geez.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.456
What?All right, just stop.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.719
Well, then, tell me
what's happening.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.024
I can't see. He keeps
turning his back to me.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.026
Inconsiderate bastard.

12:03.070 --> 12:05.768
Okay, he says he's gonna
drown Hetty in her protective

12:05.812 --> 12:07.770
moat of lies.Wow, he's also
an eloquent bastard.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.380
I don't know if I should
love him or hate him.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.862
"Along with everybody else
involved in Mexico."

12:12.906 --> 12:15.299
Definitely leaning
towards hate.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.174
SAM: You think Mosley's
really gonna protect us on this?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.653
You don't?

12:21.697 --> 12:23.307
I'd like to think so, now
that she's got her son back,

12:23.351 --> 12:25.222
but she let us risk all
of our lives to save him.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.311
Well, she never asked any of you
to be involved.

12:27.355 --> 12:28.791
Still makes you wonder
what she's willing

12:28.835 --> 12:29.966
to do to save herself.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.185
It's two different things.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.403
Are they?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.449
I've got some locals
working on it.

12:34.492 --> 12:36.668
Well, this day just keeps
getting better and better.

12:36.712 --> 12:39.541
Later.It's been a while, Sabatino.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.151
No kidding.

12:41.195 --> 12:43.980
Can't remember when I saw you
guys last-- oh, wait, yes I do.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.591
You choked me out and left me
handcuffed to an ATM.

12:46.635 --> 12:48.985
Well, he has a tough time
showing affection.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.596
Looks like you boys
survived Mexico. Nice work.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.337
Oh, you heard about that?Oh, yeah.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.122
Heard you also burned Arlo Turk.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.427
That guy was probably
the biggest source

12:56.471 --> 12:58.342
of cartel intel in the country.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.822
Heads are gonna roll.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.606
Hopefully, they won't be yours.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.521
CALLEN:
You wouldn't happen to know

13:03.565 --> 13:05.219
where Hetty is
right about now, would you?

13:05.262 --> 13:08.135
Nope. And I don't want to.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.921
Know this guy?

13:11.965 --> 13:13.009
Nope.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.489
Who is he?

13:14.532 --> 13:17.492
Lonny McKay, career criminal
and a CI of mine.

13:17.535 --> 13:21.104
Not the sharpest tool in the
shed, today being no exception.

13:21.148 --> 13:22.497
Texting tourist
T-boned his car

13:22.540 --> 13:24.499
with two bodies
in his trunk.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.153
Try saying that
three times fast.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.676
Yeah, we picked him up

13:27.719 --> 13:30.592
on, like, an electric scooter
about six blocks from here.

13:30.635 --> 13:35.423
Olga Tusova, still waiting
on a green card,

13:35.466 --> 13:36.554
profession listed
as "actress."

13:36.598 --> 13:37.860
This guy,
however, is...

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
Brian Collins.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.298
He was the youngest
West Coast director

13:41.342 --> 13:43.387
of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.

13:43.431 --> 13:45.041
He was.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.651
This is his house.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.610
I don't get why we're here.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.438
I mean, other than the fact
that maybe you miss us.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.831
We found this

13:51.874 --> 13:55.965
on the killer's phone,
which he left in the car.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.880
Okay, so when you say "we," who
is it that you're working for?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.012
Because I know the CIA

13:59.055 --> 14:01.057
isn't allowed to
work domestically.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.493
Who said anything about working?

14:02.537 --> 14:04.756
Well, now, this sucks.Right

14:04.800 --> 14:06.106
It's a cartel hit list.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.847
Was Collins on it?

14:07.890 --> 14:10.893
Yeah. He's not the only one.

14:10.937 --> 14:13.635
SABATINO: They haven't
identified your team,

14:13.678 --> 14:15.506
but they have provided
security photos and descriptions

14:15.550 --> 14:18.596
that match all of you.
Turk isn't so lucky,

14:18.640 --> 14:21.904
and neither is your Executive
Assistant Director Mosley.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.601
They know who she is,

14:23.645 --> 14:25.125
and they got a million dollars
on her head.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.215
Along with her kid.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.578
CALLEN: If it's a cartel hit,
why bother moving the bodies?

14:43.621 --> 14:45.319
Because Lonny McKay's
an amateur and an idiot,

14:45.362 --> 14:46.886
out to make a quick buck.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.104
Can we question him?

14:48.148 --> 14:49.497
Sure. But it's not gonna
do you any good.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.890
He's got no cartel
connections whatsoever.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.717
Well, he will as someone
pays him for the hit.

14:52.761 --> 14:53.936
That's not gonna happen now.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.111
What if it did?

14:55.155 --> 14:57.026
Well, play it out,
where does it land?

14:57.070 --> 14:58.636
An offshore wire transfer
to his account

14:58.680 --> 15:00.421
from a country that has
no disclosure laws?

15:00.464 --> 15:02.292
Well, maybe we get lucky,
maybe someone pays him in cash.

15:02.336 --> 15:05.252
They're not that stupid. And
even if they were, they're not.

15:05.295 --> 15:06.862
They get a nobody local courier,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.690
some kid who doesn't know
anything, who gets his orders

15:08.733 --> 15:10.213
from another
disconnected nobody.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.085
Well, if you turn over
enough nobodies,

15:12.128 --> 15:13.434
eventually,
you'll get a somebody.

15:13.477 --> 15:16.350
When did your partner
turn into Matlock?

15:16.393 --> 15:17.960
I actually prefer Baretta.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.658
We need to shut down that site,

15:20.702 --> 15:22.399
and every other site
with the hit list.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.271
I've got the NSA cyber nuts
already working on that.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.229
Unfortunately, it's already been
out there on the dark Web

15:26.273 --> 15:27.752
for at least two weeks.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.972
What if we got Mosley
and her son off the list?

15:30.016 --> 15:32.975
How?Well, there's only two options:

15:33.019 --> 15:36.196
either we hack the site...

15:36.239 --> 15:37.632
or we kill them.CALLEN:
Mm-hmm.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.851
If they think Mosley
and her kid are dead...

15:39.895 --> 15:41.070
They'll take them off the list.

15:42.115 --> 15:45.553
You two are adorable.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.949
ERIC:
Yikes.
I know.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.473
But the good news is, we go to
great lengths to keep our people

15:52.516 --> 15:55.693
off any data sites susceptible
to facial rec software.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.695
Yeah, that's not gonna
help Mosley or her son.

15:57.739 --> 15:59.871
Can we trace the original source
of the hit list?

15:59.915 --> 16:01.917
Oh, I am way ahead
of you, cowboy.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.440
So who posted it, partner?

16:03.484 --> 16:05.051
Well, not that far ahead, Tex.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.053
: Well, the
cartels are increasingly more

16:07.096 --> 16:08.968
tech savvy, my little doggies.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.578
No.Nope.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.232
:
Didn't feel right.KENSI: Does Mosley

16:12.275 --> 16:13.711
know about any of this yet?

16:13.755 --> 16:14.669
Um...

16:14.712 --> 16:15.975
No.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.367
Nobody's told Mosley?

16:17.411 --> 16:18.978
Great.

16:21.284 --> 16:22.416
Can we help you?

16:25.027 --> 16:28.552
Yeah, I think this needs
to be seen by a lawyer.

16:28.596 --> 16:31.033
And I'm LAPD.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.904
I'm the tech op.
This looks like Intel.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.210
NELL:
Oh.

16:34.254 --> 16:37.387
This is way above my pay grade,
so no can do...

16:37.431 --> 16:40.086
Okay.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.048
It's good-- good talk, though.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.485
Taco.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.921
I'm hungry.

16:49.965 --> 16:53.055
Oh, for the love of George
Dewey, I know she's small,

16:53.099 --> 16:55.188
but somebody must know
where she is.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.321
Well, then,
she's up to something,

16:58.365 --> 17:01.063
because she would never
abandon her people.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.022
All I know is that we need
a comprehensive narrative

17:03.065 --> 17:05.676
of what went down in Mexico
that's shared by everyone.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.939
Including Mosley?

17:07.983 --> 17:09.419
Good luck with that.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.074
This is a formal request
for all communication records

17:12.118 --> 17:14.511
and satellite images
from the Mexico operation.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.384
Alleged. There was
no official operation.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.821
I also need the personnel files
of all involved parties

17:19.864 --> 17:22.084
and a secure area
for my people to set up.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.043
Want a pedicure
while you're at it?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.088
OCHOA:
Ms. Jones?

17:26.132 --> 17:27.959
Um, would you see
to it that Mr. Rogers

17:28.003 --> 17:31.093
and his people get situated
in the... in the gym?

17:31.137 --> 17:33.008
Mm. Copy that.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.055
And Ms. Jones...

17:36.098 --> 17:38.231
Please make sure
that everyone knows

17:38.274 --> 17:40.059
that the gym
and the shooting range

17:40.102 --> 17:43.497
are to remain in operation
during our guests' visit.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.716
As a matter of fact,
both areas

17:45.760 --> 17:48.197
should remain active today.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.764
Very active.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.984
Hmm. Aye, aye, sir.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.511
LEXINGTON: Rogers has an axe
to grind against Hetty,

17:57.554 --> 18:00.862
and from what I gather,
it goes back several years.

18:00.905 --> 18:04.126
Are you suggesting that I should
sacrifice Hetty for myself?

18:04.170 --> 18:06.911
What would she do
if the roles were reversed?

18:06.955 --> 18:09.305
You think she's
survived this long

18:09.349 --> 18:12.961
without getting
blood on her hands?

18:13.004 --> 18:14.963
It's a strong play, I know,

18:15.006 --> 18:17.270
but she is at the end
of her career,

18:17.313 --> 18:19.750
if that makes it any easier.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.233
In fact, rumor is

18:24.277 --> 18:28.368
they don't even know
where she is.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.944
Ah-- that's it. She just, yep.
No, don't look now.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.209
DEEKS: She just saw
me staring at her.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.819
KENSI:
Are you sure?

18:44.862 --> 18:46.864
Yeah, 'cause now she's coming.Okay, I'll tell her.

18:46.908 --> 18:48.214
No, no. I'll tell her.We'll both tell her.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.172
Well, then, you should
probably tell her.Okay.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.260
Oh, perfect timing.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.174
Why, what's going on?

18:52.218 --> 18:53.915
Well...We all need to talk.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.177
We've got it under control.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.048
We alerted the school,
we have two agents outside

18:57.092 --> 18:59.138
of Derrick's classroom,
they're posing as teachers.

18:59.181 --> 19:01.314
SAM: And we sent
a team to your house.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.098
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:03.142 --> 19:08.190
We were about to inform
the assistant director.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.670
Inform me of what?

19:09.713 --> 19:13.761
Your name is on a cartel
hit list, along with Derrick's.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.458
ERIC:
Hey, we got a hit.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.329
Uh...

19:16.372 --> 19:18.418
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.942
We have an address for a server
that posted the list.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.770
On your phones.We got this.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.351
Hello, we're from NCIS...

19:38.394 --> 19:39.787
We're not open!

19:39.830 --> 19:41.223
That's okay. We're
not here to eat.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.355
We're from NCIS.

19:42.398 --> 19:44.183
Who?

19:44.226 --> 19:46.837
NCIS. The Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.405
Navy

19:49.449 --> 19:51.668
No. Well...

19:51.712 --> 19:54.149
Look, we need to take
a look at your computer.

19:54.193 --> 19:58.371
Computer? This is a restaurant,
and we're not open.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.377
Noy Na!

20:04.420 --> 20:07.249
You couldn't have led with that?

20:07.293 --> 20:08.424
YOUNG WOMAN:
Hi.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.948
Can I help you?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.212
Hi, I'm Agent Callen, this is
Agent Hanna, we're from NCIS.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.257
We need to take a look
at your computer.

20:15.301 --> 20:17.259
Oh, um, the restaurant
doesn't have one.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.869
We just use my laptop.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.915
But I'll get it.

20:26.268 --> 20:28.227
Mm-mm.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.236
G.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.286
You smell that?
I smell deep-fried fritters.

20:44.330 --> 20:45.722
Hey, all I smell is grease.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.681
Well, you say grease
and I say heaven.

20:47.724 --> 20:50.118
Maybe it'll help absorb
some of that sucrose

20:50.161 --> 20:52.555
that you force-fed me
this morning like a baby bird.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.514
CALLEN :
Kens, Deeks, Asian woman, 20s,

20:54.557 --> 20:56.951
making a run for it.KENSI: Copy that.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.480
She's out front.Take the back.

21:04.524 --> 21:07.396
He's trying to abduct me.
He's trying to abduct me!

21:07.440 --> 21:10.051
NCIS.
Listen, listen... Hey...

21:14.055 --> 21:17.014
Hey, listen, buddy, let's--
All right, all right, all right.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.408
Hey, hey, hey
Come on.

Hey, calm down!
All right, all right.

21:23.891 --> 21:24.848
Freeze.
Freeze.

21:24.892 --> 21:26.459
Stop.
Son of a...

21:26.502 --> 21:28.896
DEEKS: They always run.
They alwaysrun.

21:38.645 --> 21:41.256
Okay, all right.
On the car.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.737
That's right, kids,
varsity ultimate

21:43.780 --> 21:45.608
Frisbee captain
right here.

21:45.652 --> 21:49.308
How was that even a thing?

21:49.351 --> 21:51.135
Thanks for your help
back there.

21:51.179 --> 21:54.487
I don't speak Thai.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.325
As your friend
and a mother,

22:06.368 --> 22:08.327
I understand
your need to do this.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.154
But as your attorney,
I think that we need

22:10.198 --> 22:11.634
to take a moment.

22:11.678 --> 22:15.725
I don't have a moment, okay?
And neither does Derrik.

22:15.769 --> 22:19.555
You're playing into everything
they've accused you of.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.123
It's my job to protect you.
Let me do my job.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.778
And it is my job
to protect my son,

22:24.821 --> 22:26.823
so you need to
let me do mine.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.042
I have to do this.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.480
Her son is in danger.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.395
I was told he was
assigned a protection detail.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.745
My son won't be safe
until he's with me.

22:35.789 --> 22:37.834
You launched a private war
in a foreign country

22:37.878 --> 22:39.227
to get your son back.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.881
See, I'm not gonna allow you
to do the same here.

22:40.924 --> 22:42.143
If you really want
to protect your son,

22:42.186 --> 22:44.406
you will cooperate
with this investigation.

22:44.450 --> 22:46.669
I am cooperating
with this investigation,

22:46.713 --> 22:49.368
and I will continue to do so
once I have my son back.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.760
We'll have him brought here.

22:50.804 --> 22:53.023
I'll go and get him.No, you won't.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.895
Please don't try to stop me.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.549
I don't do well
when I am cornered.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.159
Are you threatening me,
EAD Mosley?

22:58.202 --> 23:01.249
I need to protect my son.

23:01.292 --> 23:04.557
You won't be able to do so
from jail.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.254
Now stand down.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.484
You put out the list that got
all these people killed.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.748
YOUNG WOMAN :
Look, I didn't hurt anyone.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.053
Those people aren't
from the list.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.142
Wait, so you're saying
that Callen is lying?

23:25.186 --> 23:27.449
Huh. Interesting.

23:27.493 --> 23:31.235
Really? Then why do we have
20 dead bodies, huh?

23:31.279 --> 23:32.672
Look at this one.

23:34.935 --> 23:38.373
SAM: She was a
12-year-old girl.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.420
Geez, where the hell
is that from?

23:41.463 --> 23:44.292
Eric took a screen grab
from his favorite slasher movie.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.511
Welcome to Hollywood.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.817
Smoke and mirrors,
Sabatino.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.863
Smoke and mirrors.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.475
Your list makes you
an accessory

23:53.519 --> 23:54.998
to over 20 murders.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.392
We call that a serial killer.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.047
:
Oh, my God.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.658
It's not my list.

24:02.702 --> 24:05.966
CALLEN: You post it.
You update it.

24:06.009 --> 24:07.663
They paid me to do it.Who?

24:07.707 --> 24:09.926
I don't know.

24:09.970 --> 24:12.712
Look, I'm sorry.

24:12.755 --> 24:15.889
My grandmother's getting older.

24:15.932 --> 24:18.326
Her business is struggling.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.067
This guy asked me to do
some computer work for him.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.503
I didn't even know what it was.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.070
Yeah?

24:23.113 --> 24:26.247
Well, that computer was in
your grandmother's restaurant.

24:26.290 --> 24:28.292
She'll be charged
as an accessory.

24:28.336 --> 24:31.252
She didn't do anything.

24:31.295 --> 24:34.821
Oh, God, this
is a nightmare.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.127
CALLEN:
Madee...

24:37.171 --> 24:39.739
it only gets worse from here.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.050
He meets me once a week
at Echo Park

24:47.094 --> 24:50.837
with the stuff
he wants me to post.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.235
Anything?
Not yet.

24:58.279 --> 24:59.628
I'm scanning through
social media,

24:59.672 --> 25:02.152
ATM, traffic, Metro Link,
you name it,

25:02.196 --> 25:03.719
in and around Echo Park.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.031
No. No, no, no, no.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.946
No, there is no way

25:12.989 --> 25:15.035
that they expect me to
retrieve anything off of that.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.384
It smells like a churro.

25:16.427 --> 25:18.517
Well...

25:18.560 --> 25:20.475
Ooh, there.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.129
On the screen.

25:22.172 --> 25:24.348
ERIC: Great. Now we just need
a shot where he shows his face.

25:24.392 --> 25:25.785
NELL:
Exactly.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.833
Sirs. Uh, can we help you?

25:30.877 --> 25:34.054
Special Counsel Rogers would
like to ask you a few questions.

25:34.097 --> 25:36.578
"You" plural,
mean

25:36.622 --> 25:41.148
No, "you" singular,
meaning one of... one of us.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.281
"You" singular,
meaning me.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.196
Um, okay.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.111
Questions about...
about what?

25:48.155 --> 25:49.243
Mexico.

25:49.286 --> 25:53.029
Mexico.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.509
Our neighbors to the south.

25:54.553 --> 25:59.340
"México," the word, comes
from the Nahuatl language,

25:59.383 --> 26:01.429
which was once
referred to as "Aztec,"

26:01.472 --> 26:04.127
meaning "Home
of the Mexica."

26:04.171 --> 26:08.131
Major exports include...Okay. Thank you.

26:18.228 --> 26:20.230
You like sports?

26:20.274 --> 26:22.276
Some.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.366
Feel free to elaborate.

26:28.282 --> 26:30.501
Baseball?

26:30.545 --> 26:33.461
Nope.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.158
I like playing football.Oh, yeah?

26:35.202 --> 26:36.290
What position?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.031
Goalie.

26:38.074 --> 26:41.643
Goalie.
You mean soccer.

26:41.687 --> 26:44.907
It's called football
in most of the world.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.346
Hey, sweetie.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.000
Derrick?

26:51.044 --> 26:53.046
Hey, Mom.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.090
Is everything okay?

26:54.134 --> 26:57.790
Yeah. Why?
What's going on?

26:57.833 --> 27:01.097
I'll just, um...
Excuse me, I'm, uh...

27:01.141 --> 27:03.230
So, we've got a name
and address for the man

27:03.273 --> 27:06.450
who's been providing names
for the, um... the list.

27:08.365 --> 27:09.323
And who is he?

27:09.366 --> 27:11.586
Oh, that would be Hector Leyva,

27:11.630 --> 27:13.153
aka "El Cuchillo."

27:13.196 --> 27:15.634
"The knife."
Yeah.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.070
Apparently Mr. Leyva
has an affinity

27:17.113 --> 27:19.420
for well-honed cutlery.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.595
The team's on their way

27:20.639 --> 27:22.249
to his last known address
as we speak.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.946
Thank you.You got it.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.253
DEEKS: I mean, have you noticed
the statistical anomaly

27:26.296 --> 27:30.692
of how often we're relegated
to, like, backyards and alleys?

27:30.736 --> 27:32.825
That's because somebody has
to be here in case they run.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.131
Yeah, but that's my point,
is that they always run

27:35.175 --> 27:37.307
and then we always
have to chase them.

27:37.351 --> 27:39.788
We're like Sam and Callen's
Labrador Retrievers.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.268
And it's...
you know what it is?

27:41.311 --> 27:43.400
It's starting to become
a bone of contention.

27:43.444 --> 27:45.141
What's a bone of contention?

27:45.185 --> 27:47.753
DEEKS: It's like the catalyst
and subsequent subject

27:47.796 --> 27:49.363
of a continuous argument.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.234
KENSI: No, no, I know that.
What I'm saying is, like,

27:51.278 --> 27:53.280
why isn't it a stone
of contention

27:53.323 --> 27:56.109
or a fiery coal of contention,
or just something, you know...

27:56.152 --> 27:58.154
CALLEN:
Would you two please shut up?

28:00.504 --> 28:02.811
How you doing?

28:02.855 --> 28:05.422
Hector home?

28:05.466 --> 28:06.728
Hector Leyva?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.077
SAM: ¿Hector está aquí?

28:08.121 --> 28:10.601
Nada?

28:10.645 --> 28:14.780
We're federal agents.
¿Federales?

28:14.823 --> 28:15.998
Kind like ICE.

28:17.783 --> 28:21.612
Don't patronize me.
I'm an American citizen.

28:21.656 --> 28:24.093
And I probably speak English
better than you two.

28:24.137 --> 28:27.096
I just choose not to converse
with the storm troopers

28:27.140 --> 28:30.099
of a fascist regime that
marginalizes people of color.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.318
You know, I actually wish

28:31.361 --> 28:33.276
they'd let us wear
storm trooper outfits.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.148
I mean, you would look amazing
in storm trooper armor.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.498
Kind of like a Transformer.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.762
This is where you invite us in
to take a look around.

28:40.806 --> 28:42.416
And why would I do that?

28:42.459 --> 28:45.332
Well, the alternative is that we
start asking for identification,

28:45.375 --> 28:47.377
which we cross-reference
with outstanding warrants,

28:47.421 --> 28:50.380
and hopefully, none of you are
holding or packing.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.470
So, being profiled as drug-using

28:53.514 --> 28:55.255
gun

28:57.910 --> 28:59.868
Record this law enforcement
harassment.

29:01.827 --> 29:06.701
Yo, Hector.
You got company.

29:15.884 --> 29:18.365
We're in.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.471
♪

30:55.331 --> 30:57.507
♪

31:41.290 --> 31:43.292
♪

31:46.382 --> 31:49.385
What the hell, man?

31:49.429 --> 31:51.344
I'm taking a bath here.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.750
Although you are not under oath,
I still expect you

32:06.794 --> 32:09.188
to tell the truth to the best
of your ability, Mr. Beale.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.842
You do not need
to give me Veritaserum.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.670
It's, uh, from, you know,

32:13.714 --> 32:15.672
remember when-when
Professor Snape

32:15.716 --> 32:18.327
was threatening Harry Potter
and it was, uh...

32:18.371 --> 32:20.895
It's The Goblet of Fire.
It's a very popular...

32:20.939 --> 32:22.853
Just try and relax, Eric.

32:22.897 --> 32:25.204
Don't you, don't you
worry about me, Deputy Dawg.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.727
I'm...

32:26.770 --> 32:28.642
I'm ch...
I'm cool. I'm s...

32:28.685 --> 32:30.644
I'm sup-super chill.
I'm...

32:30.687 --> 32:33.081
March 19, 2017.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.431
You discharged a
firearm at an SUV

32:35.475 --> 32:37.694
that resulted in the
deaths of two people.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.783
Where are you going
with this, Rogers?Hi.

32:39.827 --> 32:42.917
I would like
to know why...

32:42.961 --> 32:46.660
I'd like to know why
a technical operator

32:46.703 --> 32:48.053
was in possession
of an agency weapon.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.924
This has nothing to do
with why you're here.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.667
I'm trying to understand why...

32:53.710 --> 32:57.105
I'm try... I'm trying
to understand why...

32:57.149 --> 33:00.804
I'm trying to understand Mr.
Beale's role within the agency,

33:00.848 --> 33:01.980
in this office, specifically.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.982
I was on assignment.

33:04.025 --> 33:05.809
An assignment given to you
by Henrietta Lange?

33:07.942 --> 33:08.943
Yes.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.901
But you're not a special agent?

33:10.945 --> 33:12.120
Uh, well...

33:12.164 --> 33:14.688
It's a simple question:
yes or no?

33:16.603 --> 33:19.040
Um, no.

33:19.084 --> 33:21.869
And yet, two people are dead
because you...

33:21.912 --> 33:23.088
OCHOA: Okay,
that's enough.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.481
Our people agreed
to questions regarding

33:25.525 --> 33:27.701
what recently transpired
in Mexico.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.833
If your line of inquiry is not
directly related to that,

33:29.877 --> 33:31.835
then I'm gonna have to suggest
they stop cooperating.

33:31.879 --> 33:35.578
You provided technical support
to five members of this office

33:35.622 --> 33:37.754
who were on the
ground in Mexico...

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
...knowing full well that it was
an unsanctioned and illegal

33:40.061 --> 33:41.280
operation. What?!

33:43.717 --> 33:46.241
Don't answer that.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.074
I've just been informed
that your people

33:53.118 --> 33:54.510
were involved in a shoot-out

33:54.554 --> 33:58.166
that has left
four people dead.

33:58.210 --> 34:01.996
You're almost making this
too easy.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.568
How long have you been
working for the cartels?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.006
You entered my house
without a warrant.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.703
We were invited in.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.401
Not by me.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.794
You posted
a cartel hit list.

34:17.838 --> 34:19.840
No idea what
you're talking about.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.277
I don't even own a computer.Mm-hmm.

34:22.321 --> 34:26.934
What I do know are my rights,
which are being violated.

34:26.977 --> 34:31.634
This is an unlawful arrest
and a forcible confinement.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.071
You ever heard
of murder for hire?

34:34.681 --> 34:37.771
It basically makes you guilty
by association.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.425
CALLEN: One
of the people

34:39.468 --> 34:41.035
on your hit list
was assassinated this morning,

34:41.079 --> 34:42.428
along with another person,

34:42.471 --> 34:44.952
which means you can
be charged as well.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.998
That little hit list of yours,
that makes it premeditated,

34:48.042 --> 34:50.958
so we're talking first degree
times two.

34:51.001 --> 34:54.004
That's 25 to life
times two.

34:54.048 --> 34:55.963
Well, if you get a good lawyer,
second degree,

34:56.006 --> 34:56.920
they'll get it down to 15 years.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.270
Times two.

34:58.313 --> 35:01.142
That's if it doesn't go
to a foreign cartel

35:01.186 --> 35:03.797
targeting Americans because
that's domestic terrorism.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.494
Mm-hmm. And that
is the sound

35:05.538 --> 35:06.930
of you being dropped
into a black hole

35:06.974 --> 35:09.063
never to be seen
or heard from again.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.153
Need a lawyer. Now.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.024
Mm-hmm.
Of course.

35:14.068 --> 35:17.027
But, uh, in cases of
domestic terrorism,

35:17.071 --> 35:19.552
we get to hold you for 14 days
without telling anybody.

35:19.595 --> 35:22.859
So we'll get back to you
on that in a couple weeks.

35:24.252 --> 35:27.125
Guys. Come here.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.086
Okay, so, our male
is a local gangbanger.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.435
Nothing special.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.568
Our two lovely ladies
were carrying fake IDs,

35:35.611 --> 35:37.439
which in and of itself
isn't compelling, but...

35:37.483 --> 35:41.008
Thelma and Louise were both
packing Belgian FNs 5.7s.Exactly.

35:41.051 --> 35:43.619
Mata policia,AKA...

35:43.663 --> 35:46.100
Cop killers 'cause they
pierce body armor.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.277
And also the chosen weapons
of cartel hit men and women.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.801
There's a good chance
they're both sicarias.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.194
Sounds like the
general decided

35:53.238 --> 35:55.109
not to put his faith
in headhunters.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.633
Decided to bring in some
pros to finish the job.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.287
Well, the good news
is we stopped them.

35:59.331 --> 36:01.202
Well, this time.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.465
Kensi's right.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.989
This isn't over.

36:06.033 --> 36:08.035
There'll be others.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.570
DERRICK: Was
that a sea lion?

36:21.614 --> 36:24.617
Uh, that's Otis.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.489
He's sort of like
my guard dog.

36:27.533 --> 36:31.101
You remember Agent
Hanna, don't you?

36:31.145 --> 36:33.495
Sam, please. It's good
to see you again.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.584
Ready to get
your sea legs?

36:35.628 --> 36:36.803
I guess.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.326
Are we going out tonight?

36:38.370 --> 36:39.806
Ah, we got to see what happens
with the storm front first,

36:39.849 --> 36:41.329
but, uh, in the meantime,

36:41.373 --> 36:42.809
go inside,
make yourself comfortable.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.158
There's a hammock
right off the galley.

36:45.420 --> 36:46.639
It's the kitchen.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.859
Hey, hey, hey.

36:49.903 --> 36:52.775
Where are you going? You got
to give me a hug first.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.734
I love you, baby.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.039
Love you, too.

36:56.083 --> 36:57.040
All right, go get
yourself settled

36:57.084 --> 36:58.346
while I talk to Sam.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.392
Aye, aye.

37:03.569 --> 37:05.048
Thank you for this.

37:05.092 --> 37:08.138
I need time to put
a few things in place.

37:08.182 --> 37:10.184
Happy to help.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.099
It's good to get to know him.

37:12.142 --> 37:15.276
He'll be safe here.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.278
Yeah, I know.

37:17.322 --> 37:21.978
As someone who's been
through a few things myself,

37:22.022 --> 37:25.982
I can promise you that
this, too, will pass.

37:29.203 --> 37:32.250
And don't worry
about Derrick.

37:32.293 --> 37:35.122
Kids are way more
resilient than you think.

37:35.165 --> 37:38.081
I hope I am, too.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.041
It's been a long time
since I've been a mother.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.695
You two weren't together,

37:42.738 --> 37:45.306
but you never stopped
being his mother.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.612
That's why he's here.

37:46.655 --> 37:50.006
I could've done this sooner.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.312
How?

37:51.356 --> 37:54.054
His father abducted him
to another country.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.664
No one can blame you for that.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.450
And you can't blame yourself.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.930
Mexico's a different matter.

38:00.974 --> 38:03.803
You've never had to choose

38:03.846 --> 38:06.327
between your family
and your career, Sam.

38:06.371 --> 38:08.677
Most men don't.

38:08.721 --> 38:10.679
It's different for women.

38:10.723 --> 38:14.074
Even Michelle gave up her career
for your kids.

38:16.946 --> 38:20.080
I'm sorry. I...
I'm not judging you.

38:24.171 --> 38:26.173
I'm really good
at what I do, Sam.

38:26.216 --> 38:29.350
I just don't know that I'm gonna
be good at being a mother again.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.221
What if I screw this up?

38:31.265 --> 38:32.310
You won't.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.487
He's got a bounty on his head.

38:35.530 --> 38:37.315
Not for long.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.317
We're taking care of that.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.362
And if something happens to me,
then who...

38:41.406 --> 38:43.364
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.370
Yeah.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.027
We'll keep him safe...

38:54.070 --> 38:56.856
but you have to fix this.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.293
You.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.208
You have to fix it for Derrick,

39:01.251 --> 39:03.253
you have to fix it for yourself

39:03.297 --> 39:06.344
and you have to fix it
for the team.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.900
Where's your lawyer?

39:43.468 --> 39:46.384
I'm here off the record.

39:46.427 --> 39:49.256
This is between you and me.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.823
What do you want?

39:50.866 --> 39:54.783
I want to know what I need to do
to make this all go away.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.406
Where is everyone?

40:08.449 --> 40:11.626
Your executive assistant
director's been placed

40:11.670 --> 40:14.107
on administrative leave
for the time being--

40:14.150 --> 40:17.066
and your operations manager
as well, not that it matters

40:17.110 --> 40:18.372
because nobody seems
to know where she is.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.374
I understand
you two are close.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.420
Have any idea
where she might be?

40:24.465 --> 40:28.164
I stopped second-guessing Hetty
a long time ago.

40:28.208 --> 40:29.688
Does this mean you're staying?

40:29.731 --> 40:32.517
No, I'm going back to Washington
to do some damage control.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.170
You're gonna be
acting supervisor

40:34.214 --> 40:36.782
until we hear otherwise.Okay.

40:38.827 --> 40:42.875
You and your people
need to be extra careful.

40:42.918 --> 40:45.443
The special prosecutor's
looking for blood

40:45.486 --> 40:48.141
from Mosley, Hetty
and everyone else involved

40:48.184 --> 40:50.143
and don't think for a minute
that he's gonna limit

40:50.186 --> 40:51.492
his investigation to Mexico.

40:51.536 --> 40:53.668
He's gonna dig deep
into all of you.

40:53.712 --> 40:57.324
In your case,
Agent Callen,

40:57.367 --> 40:59.282
your associations
with an ATF agent

40:59.326 --> 41:01.850
who's currently under
investigation, Anna Kolcheck,

41:01.894 --> 41:07.073
and rogue CIA Officer Joelle
Taylor aren't gonna help any.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.467
Any advice?

41:13.166 --> 41:16.865
You might want to consider
celibacy until this is all over.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.748
Hello?

41:29.791 --> 41:32.141
DISTORTED VOICE:
Good evening, Mr. Callen.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.534
Who is this?

41:33.578 --> 41:36.842
Do you know the story
of the lady and the tiger?

41:36.885 --> 41:39.235
Why the voice changer?

41:39.279 --> 41:41.803
For everyone's protection.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.936
And how do I know
this isn't a trick?

41:43.979 --> 41:45.372
Try me.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.645
Where are you?

41:57.689 --> 41:59.560
Nowhere I want to be.

41:59.604 --> 42:01.693
How is everyone holding up?

42:01.736 --> 42:04.522
We're fine.
Just... tell me where you are.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.480
I need you to forget about me

42:06.524 --> 42:08.569
and focus on keeping
the team safe.

42:08.613 --> 42:11.354
I'm afraid things may be getting
worse for both of us

42:11.398 --> 42:13.182
before they get any better.

42:13.226 --> 42:16.229
And I won't be there to help
for quite a while.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.537
Why not?

42:20.929 --> 42:24.019
Enough with the riddles.
What the hell is going on?

42:24.063 --> 42:26.065
Hetty.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.807
Hetty?
