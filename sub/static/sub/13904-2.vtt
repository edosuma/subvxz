WEBVTT

00:50.760 --> 00:54.160
BELLE: We all fantasise,
to escape our ordinary lives.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.040
And, in my line of work,
I AM the fantasy.

01:03.640 --> 01:06.480
Every encounter lingers
like a ghost,

01:06.480 --> 01:08.240
following me all the way home.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.320
It keeps me company.

01:10.320 --> 01:14.760
Someone to share the secret of
who I am, and what I've just done.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.240
Jackie?
(BUZZING)

01:28.880 --> 01:30.360
We need to talk.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.160
(URBAN MUSIC)

02:12.880 --> 02:15.080
What is this place?
It's a fetish club.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I can't tell Jackie
what I do for a living,

02:19.000 --> 02:20.960
but I can open her mind.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.840
Reboot her sex drive.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.480
And what better place to begin
her education than here?

02:29.720 --> 02:31.400
Look at them!

02:31.400 --> 02:33.560
These people are disgusting.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.440
Most people see sex as a bit of fun.
You need to loosen up a bit.

02:36.440 --> 02:38.640
I do not need loosening up.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.480
You need tightening up.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.600
Does mum know how much
you masturbate?

02:42.600 --> 02:44.600
Does mum know you've left Patrick?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.240
Hannah, can we leave please?

02:50.240 --> 02:54.280
I need a wee and I couldn't
fit my hand sanitizer in
this stupid handbag

02:54.280 --> 02:57.760
and I am not getting an STD
from one of these freaks,
thanks very much.

02:57.760 --> 03:00.040
When was the last time you had sex?
What?

03:00.040 --> 03:03.040
A couple of months?
Yes. A couple of months.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.440
How many?
Six.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.320
Or 11.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.960
Jackie that's really serious.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.960
Eurgh!

03:13.160 --> 03:16.400
I want to leave
and I want to leave now.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.480
You wear open-toed shoes,
you're going to get licked.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.800
Excuse me. Hello.

03:27.600 --> 03:31.160
Is there a problem, my love?
We'd like this coat back please.
We're leaving.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.680
Why are you leaving now? You look
gorgeous! Because she's miserable.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.560
She's hasn't had sex in a year,

03:36.560 --> 03:38.560
she left her husband,
cos he had a fling,

03:38.560 --> 03:40.880
and she's sleeping on my sofa.
Oh, you poor thing.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.600
That sounds awful. Are you OK?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.800
I'm fine thanks.
It's really not something -

03:44.800 --> 03:47.240
She's really uptight.
My ex did exactly the same.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.640
I could just about understand
a little fling.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.640
What I couldn't stomach was
the secrecy.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.600
That's what
I've been trying to tell her,

03:53.600 --> 03:56.200
but she doesn't understand.
She's young, isn't she?

03:56.200 --> 03:59.440
I do understand.
I sort of understand.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.520
She's never even had
a proper relationship.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.320
Oh, sweetheart.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.480
Look, I've just finished my shift
for the night.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.320
Do you fancy a drink?

04:07.320 --> 04:09.040
You look like
you could do with one.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.840
# Take me away

04:10.840 --> 04:12.960
Just look at
all these delicious deviants:

04:12.960 --> 04:16.120
toe licking teachers,
busty bank managers,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.040
cling-filmed cupboard care workers.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.360
# With this burning
deep inside... #

04:23.360 --> 04:25.760
The ultimate voyeurism:

04:25.760 --> 04:28.000
peeping into
other people's fantasies.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.080
You can look, but you can't judge.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.080
Sweet.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.680
It's all my fault, I know.
That's so not true.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.400
Make it really tight. Tighter.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.120
Oh! Tighter.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.240
Ah! Yeah, that's it. Yes.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.680
Stephanie?

04:53.240 --> 04:56.960
Oh! Well, well, well.
Business or pleasure?

04:56.960 --> 04:58.920
Pleasure. You?

04:58.920 --> 05:01.080
Bit of both.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.680
How is business?
Yeah, you know. Busy.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.320
Regulars keep me in shoes.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.040
I meant the writing work.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.880
You are a writer now, aren't you?

05:12.840 --> 05:14.920
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.720
I know it was you who wrote
that filthy little book.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.760
I want to know why you said I've
been ripping off girls for years.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.720
Well, you have. It's hardly slander.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.400
You called me
as sexy as a smear test!

05:25.400 --> 05:27.760
Yeah, I was quite pleased
with that one.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.400
It's cheap, Belle.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.040
A cheap joke for a cheap whore.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.840
Oh, really?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.640
I seem to remember you describing me
as 'deluxe' on your website.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.080
Well, delightful as this has been,
you'll have to excuse me.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.720
# Do I look like a slut?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.120
# Do I look like a slut? #

05:49.120 --> 05:51.240
Under the cloak of darkness,

05:51.240 --> 05:53.440
our fantasies can come out to play.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.040
But, when the sun comes up,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.120
We all have a life
to be getting on with.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.280
Fulfilling a client's fantasy
takes a lot of careful preparation.

06:09.280 --> 06:14.120
You have to exfoliate away
any hint of real life.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.400
Jackie!

06:20.400 --> 06:22.080
Sorry, I can't wait any longer.

06:34.320 --> 06:38.200
If I was on Belle's rate, I would
have earned Â£2,000 more this week.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.320
And your point is?

06:40.320 --> 06:42.280
My point is - it's not fair.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.160
Sorry, I still don't get
what your point is.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.280
I want to go up to 350 an hour.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.840
And I don't want
any more one-hour clients.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.080
No-one will pay 350 quid an hour
for you.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.000
Why not?
Darling, you're common.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.880
What? They want Stepford Wives
who can suck,

06:58.880 --> 07:00.720
not EastEnders who can fuck.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.280
Just because you've known me
from the start doesn't mean
you can hold me back.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.480
Bambi, we can't charge
any more for you.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.080
You're black.

07:09.480 --> 07:11.400
Tell me you didn't just say that.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.680
I know! Outrageous isn't it?

07:13.680 --> 07:16.560
Especially as all of you girls
have superior figures.

07:16.560 --> 07:20.920
Are you telling me I can't go up to
350 an hour because I'm not white?

07:20.920 --> 07:22.360
Are you telling me I can't go up to
350 an hour because I'm not white?

07:22.360 --> 07:24.320
The clients won't pay
for black girls.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.080
And don't blame me.
Blame the racist clients.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.200
Yes, hello.
I've got a lovely girl as dev...

07:32.520 --> 07:35.000
Right. Shut up!

07:35.000 --> 07:36.920
I might not be as posh as you,

07:36.920 --> 07:39.560
but you can fuck off
if you think I'm gonna stand here

07:39.560 --> 07:42.760
and let you tell me
I'm cheap because I'm black.

07:42.760 --> 07:46.080
I'm not racist. It's just a fact
that clients do not pay for -

07:46.080 --> 07:48.920
No, no, no, no.
You're not listening to me, yeah.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.520
(ENUNCIATES CLEARLY) Didn't they
teach you to listen in posh school?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.600
You set our rates, not the clients.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.120
I can't dictate
people's sexual preferences.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.880
You can dictate that black girls -
and, by way, I'm mixed race -

08:01.880 --> 08:03.960
are worth less than white girls?

08:03.960 --> 08:07.200
Do you do that? Do you do that?

08:07.200 --> 08:09.360
Because if there is somebody else
in charge,

08:09.360 --> 08:10.880
I would like
to speak to them please.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.440
Have you been in here again?

08:23.440 --> 08:25.600
What are you looking for?
It doesn't matter.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.280
(PHONE RINGS)

08:28.640 --> 08:30.760
Do you want me to get that?
No, just leave it.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.960
Han, it's Ben. I'm coming over
with some booze to celebrate.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.600
I've just finished reading -

08:37.600 --> 08:39.840
Why didn't you pick it up?

08:39.840 --> 08:41.880
When are you going to go home?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.679
(BUZZER)

08:47.160 --> 08:48.840
Who's that?

08:48.840 --> 08:50.720
No-one.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.880
It must be someone.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.080
Why don't you check the train times
on my laptop?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.960
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:00.120 --> 09:02.680
What do you want? You haven't
been answering your phone.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.480
Stephanie's given me a booking
with an aristocrat

09:06.480 --> 09:08.440
and I just need to go through
some things.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.120
I'm in a rush, Bambi -
But it's my biggest client yet.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.440
Yeah and I've got a client too,
and I'm in a rush.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.720
That's OK, I'll talk,
you get ready. No.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.120
Well, why not? Cos my sister's
still here and you can't meet her.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.640
Now I've got to go.
Why? Is it because I'm common?

09:21.640 --> 09:23.280
What?

09:23.280 --> 09:25.440
Is it because I'm black?

09:25.440 --> 09:27.640
No, it's because you're a whore,
you muppet.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.960
Belle!

09:37.000 --> 09:38.760
What was all that about?

09:38.760 --> 09:41.440
Just a neighbour...
complaining about noise.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.720
Oh, sorry, I dropped that
last night in the club.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.840
I don't think any of those people
last night were happy. Mm-hm?

09:48.840 --> 09:52.840
I mean, they were nice people but
the way they live their lives...

09:52.840 --> 09:55.600
'Oh, look at me!
I've got a bolt through my winkle.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.760
I've never had
a normal relationship.'

09:57.760 --> 10:01.080
And your relationship with Patrick
is going just perfect, isn't it?

10:01.080 --> 10:04.000
What's that supposed to mean?
Forget it.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.960
Come on.
No. There's no point.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.800
Hannah, I want to know
what you think you know.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.720
All right.
You treat him like a pet, not a man.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.640
You run him down
in front of everyone.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.080
And you're a relationship expert
now, are you?

10:16.080 --> 10:19.880
You know what, let's just leave it,
shall we? Let's not just leave it.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.160
I don't see why you think you're
so qualified to dole out advice.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.680
I'm not.
Who do you think you are?

10:24.680 --> 10:26.680
Your life is going nowhere.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.000
Mum and Dad are always saying how
disappointed they are with you,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.360
not using your degree,
not getting a proper job.

10:32.360 --> 10:35.240
And they'd rather me have a dead end
job in a dead end marriage

10:35.240 --> 10:37.160
in a dead end town like you,
would they?

10:37.160 --> 10:39.720
Yes. Because at least then you
wouldn't be a secretary

10:39.720 --> 10:41.520
whose only chance
of getting anywhere

10:41.520 --> 10:44.680
is by fucking her way to the top.
And what have you ever achieved?

10:44.680 --> 10:47.360
A dried-up marriage with some
boring man you can't even keep!

10:49.720 --> 10:51.960
I can't believe you just hit me.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.680
Savile Row, please.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.720
Don't take notes, OK?

11:06.720 --> 11:08.360
This is not the way
to create a fantasy.

11:24.320 --> 11:26.040
Oh, no.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.040
Oh, for fuck's sake!

12:30.280 --> 12:32.200
Hey!

12:32.200 --> 12:34.240
Oh, hi. Come up.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.240
Hello?
Hi.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.400
Hi.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.920
What's... What's this for?

13:00.920 --> 13:03.680
Oh, I've come to celebrate.

13:06.760 --> 13:10.760
Is Han in?
She's out, but...I'm in.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.680
Hmm.

13:25.320 --> 13:29.040
For this client,
everything has to be just so.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.800
Hamish.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.000
Oh, Belle, you look amazing.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.000
I don't normally drink on the job,
but today I'm feeling naughty.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.120
That's good to hear.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.160
Not just yet.

14:00.160 --> 14:01.520
What?

14:01.520 --> 14:03.600
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.400
Now, I know you asked
for black underwear

14:19.400 --> 14:23.080
but today, I dunno,
today felt like a red day.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.040
Red.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.440
It certainly is a red day.

14:30.440 --> 14:32.320
Is it OK?
This is great, yeah.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.840
I was worried you wouldn't want me.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.960
It's perfect. You're perfect.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.920
I thought I might be in trouble,
if I got something wrong.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.520
You are in trouble now.

14:45.560 --> 14:47.080
Come with me.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.800
Oh, what happened to your eye?

15:04.800 --> 15:07.800
It's... I knocked it earlier.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.240
It's fine.

15:12.960 --> 15:15.160
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.280
I need to know how it happened.

15:17.280 --> 15:18.720
Really?

15:18.720 --> 15:21.280
You weren't hit by your pimp,
were you?

15:21.280 --> 15:26.080
If you have to know, I had a fight
with my sister over some lipstick.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.040
So it wasn't a pimp?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.520
No. It was a sister.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.080
OK.
OK.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.480
Sorry, sorry.
No. It's not happening.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.080
What? Why?
Look I can't do this. Not with...

15:41.080 --> 15:43.800
You shouldn't have a bruised eye.
But...

15:43.800 --> 15:46.000
Look, it's not how I had it...

15:47.400 --> 15:49.200
It's not sexy.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.880
Well, we could dim the lights.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.040
No, no, it's OK.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.040
You could try squinting.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.880
You could put a bag
over my head.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.760
You could put a bag over your head.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.840
It's not going to happen, is it?

16:13.840 --> 16:15.840
Sorry, I think the moment's passed.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.480
It's OK, don't apologise.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.520
It's just a bit...real.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.320
Yeah. No, I totally get it.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.360
Once the sexy bubble's burst,
it's burst.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.360
Well, that went well (!)

16:40.000 --> 16:42.400
Yeah, I'm on the right street,
I think.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
Where are you? You still there?

16:45.960 --> 16:47.800
Yeah, I can't see you.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.280
Bambi!

16:49.280 --> 16:51.480
Is there anybody called Bambi
out here?

16:51.480 --> 16:53.320
Yeah, its me. Hi.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.640
Hello, I'm Byron.
How the fuck are you?

17:02.200 --> 17:04.240
Did you just curtsey, then?
Yeah.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.880
Well don't. You look ridiculous.

17:06.880 --> 17:09.160
You're not American, are you?
No.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.319
Yes, well, don't.
Where are we going?

17:11.319 --> 17:13.319
Excellent.
I'm very glad you asked that.

17:13.319 --> 17:17.599
Would you be so kind
as to remove your shoes for me?

17:17.599 --> 17:20.079
Er. OK.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.000
Marvellous.
Why?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.560
Well, because now, I'm afraid,
we're going to have to run.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.880
What? OK.
Run!

17:39.680 --> 17:41.640
Oh, my days. This is amazing.

17:46.560 --> 17:47.760
Woo!

17:49.280 --> 17:51.400
(LAUGHS)
What?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.880
Oh, what?
Drink it.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.920
This is a disgrace, referee...

18:01.600 --> 18:04.240
This is the best game of chess
I've ever played. Ever.

18:06.440 --> 18:08.200
Play much, do you?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.880
This is the first time.

18:11.360 --> 18:15.320
No, I like my games with,
like, balls in the middle.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
Ball sports.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.640
Only ball games I like.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.400
Drink! Drink!

18:29.880 --> 18:31.400
Thank you.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.720
Do you know what else I like?

18:37.720 --> 18:38.840
What?

18:40.040 --> 18:42.120
You, pissed.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.040
It's brilliant.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.720
You should be pissed more often.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.760
Am I more fun?

18:48.760 --> 18:49.880
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.880
More...sexy?

18:53.880 --> 18:56.280
Well, yeah.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.560
Wow!

19:18.680 --> 19:20.560
(GROANING)

19:30.000 --> 19:31.720
What?

19:31.720 --> 19:35.040
Get out of my sister!

19:35.040 --> 19:36.880
Oh, Han.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.800
I'm sorry, Han.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.440
What are you doing, Ben?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.080
We were playing chess.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.200
Oh.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.840
Bye, Han.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.720
What are you playing at?

20:05.720 --> 20:07.560
It's just a bit of fun.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.440
You haven't had sex in a year

20:09.440 --> 20:12.240
and the first person you choose
to do it with is my best mate.

20:12.240 --> 20:16.240
You're the one who wanted me
to whatsit...loosen up.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.200
Where are you going?

20:18.200 --> 20:19.920
I'm going to Ben's.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.760
Finish what we started.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.840
We had a fight. You punched me.
Is there anything you want to say?

20:24.840 --> 20:27.920
Is there anything you wanna say
to me? Yeah, don't go to Ben's.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.040
You don't want me here, remember.
I don't want you at Ben's either.

20:32.040 --> 20:33.920
# ROY ORBISON: Mystery Girl

20:45.200 --> 20:47.560
The key to fantasy
is knowing that you're in one.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.640
It's when you start thinking it's
real that things become complicated.

21:03.360 --> 21:05.520
Fantasy and reality,

21:05.520 --> 21:07.920
and never the twain shall meet.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.200
What do you do when you can't write?

21:25.200 --> 21:27.160
Writer's block?

21:27.160 --> 21:31.000
I'm all alone in the flat
and I can't write.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.520
And everyone's gone out
and I've finally got peace and quiet

21:34.520 --> 21:37.000
and I just...I can't do it,
you know, I just sit here.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.120
Nothing happens.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.880
Well, maybe you just need
someone to talk to.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.560
Maybe.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.480
I'd like to hear whatever
you have to say,

21:49.480 --> 21:52.840
whether it's in a book,

21:52.840 --> 21:54.800
over the phone, whatever.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.640
I bet you say that
to all your writers.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.760
How was your day?

22:05.680 --> 22:08.040
We want to know about
desire. How it works.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.720
What's underneath it?
No problem.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.280
Why don't you tell me
what you'd like to do?

22:12.280 --> 22:14.240
I want to fuck you really hard.

22:14.240 --> 22:15.640
Sorry.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.440
You're really unapologetic about
your enjoyment of the job.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.000
That's...what I do.
