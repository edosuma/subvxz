01:01.130 --> 01:03.670
It's like we were doomed
to destroy our planet.

01:04.962 --> 01:07.553
Some say it was
because of the increasing pollution.

01:09.296 --> 01:10.876
I just call it human nature.

01:13.005 --> 01:15.585
A few scientists predicted
what would happen.

01:16.421 --> 01:19.671
They started working on a power station
that could be sent into space

01:19.755 --> 01:22.665
to harvest geothermal energy
from other planets.

01:25.671 --> 01:26.711
But it was too late.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.505
People would start dying in their sleep...

01:31.671 --> 01:33.511
suffocating in the streets,

01:33.588 --> 01:35.588
the blood in their veins turning black.

01:36.671 --> 01:41.051
"An unexpected change
in atmosphere composition," they said.

01:42.546 --> 01:47.086
To me it was just our planet desperately
trying to survive by kicking us out.

01:49.130 --> 01:53.130
So one day, a hundred ships
flew off into the sky.

01:58.588 --> 02:00.258
It was the Exodus mission.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.341
They turned the power station
into a colony,

02:04.838 --> 02:08.088
like a lifeboat floating above
Jupiter's volcanic moon,

02:09.130 --> 02:10.259
also known as…

03:46.296 --> 03:48.416
What do we have here?

03:54.338 --> 03:56.958
Audio memorandum initiated.

03:57.755 --> 04:01.835
Begin audio log entry 46809.

04:02.588 --> 04:04.708
Researcher ID Sam Walden.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.756
I'm looking at what appears to be
rafts of mosquito

04:08.838 --> 04:11.128
or midge fly spawn. Period.

04:11.213 --> 04:13.303
Something resembling
blooms of black algae

04:13.380 --> 04:15.840
identifiable in subsurface ponded water

04:15.921 --> 04:19.261
despite minimal opportunity
for chemosynthesis. Period.

04:21.963 --> 04:23.133
That's what I thought.

04:27.505 --> 04:31.545
Level of toxicity in ambient atmosphere:
severe.

04:34.255 --> 04:38.005
Sample 181A. Water-striding insects.

04:38.505 --> 04:42.545
Found in a zone apparently in the presence
of a strong concentration of ammonia.

04:44.505 --> 04:46.085
Sample 181B.

04:46.171 --> 04:48.961
Drawn from sediment strata,
should confirm or disconfirm

04:49.046 --> 04:53.506
the presence of bacterium able to use
ammonium as a main oxygen source.

05:25.588 --> 05:28.508
"A shudder in the loin engenders there,

05:29.630 --> 05:33.510
the broken wall,
the burning roof and tower...

05:35.046 --> 05:36.876
and Agamemnon dead."

06:06.171 --> 06:07.961
Plants are changing colors.

08:13.213 --> 08:14.213
Elon.

08:15.005 --> 08:16.665
I keep having this dream.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.633
I'm on a beach.

08:19.671 --> 08:22.421
I can feel the wind blowing in my hair,

08:23.338 --> 08:26.008
hear the sound of the waves
crashing on the shore.

08:27.213 --> 08:28.343
I can breathe.

08:53.338 --> 08:55.958
You won't believe
what I discovered this morning.

08:56.046 --> 08:59.506
Anaerobic reproduction
in a water-striding insect colony.

09:00.255 --> 09:02.125
Yet another new species.

09:02.755 --> 09:03.755
Surviving.

09:05.130 --> 09:08.130
Imagine if the bees could adapt
like those insects.

09:08.213 --> 09:10.173
It would prove that my dad is right.

09:10.921 --> 09:13.591
Earth is not dying, it's being reborn.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.460
I know things aren't easy
on the IO Colony, but...

09:18.130 --> 09:19.340
please write back soon.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.375
I love you, Elon.

09:22.088 --> 09:24.168
From Earth until the end of the universe.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
Sam.

09:44.255 --> 09:45.415
I'm sorry.

10:38.088 --> 10:39.088
Dear Sam,

10:39.796 --> 10:42.626
your scientific discoveries
never cease to astound me.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.878
Unearthing the last bits of life
hanging onto that dying world...

10:47.630 --> 10:48.670
that's amazing.

10:50.255 --> 10:53.505
Imagine what you could find
in a whole new galaxy.

10:55.005 --> 10:58.755
Just a week from now, we'll have harvested
enough of IO's volcanic energy

10:58.838 --> 11:01.668
to power the entire
New World Expedition fleet.

11:04.171 --> 11:05.921
Life is in the stars, Sam.

11:07.005 --> 11:09.295
Your father can't hold you back
any longer.

11:10.421 --> 11:13.381
Very soon, the last pocket of air on Earth
will be gone.

11:14.796 --> 11:18.546
You both need to be
on the next Exodus shuttle and come here.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.046
I love you.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.670
From IO until the end of the universe,

11:24.796 --> 11:25.796
Elon.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.960
This is Doctor Harry Walden,

12:00.046 --> 12:02.876
transmitting on frequency 90-43,

12:02.963 --> 12:06.673
listening on frequency
95-60 kilohertz daily.

12:08.713 --> 12:11.883
The world we once called home
appears to have turned against us.

12:12.838 --> 12:17.918
However bleak the situation may seem,
death is only a part of the process.

12:19.046 --> 12:21.876
The fundamental principle of nature
is survival.

12:23.213 --> 12:27.173
More than in our DNA,
it is in our mind, in our soul,

12:27.255 --> 12:29.375
to seek life no matter what.

12:32.796 --> 12:35.666
Plant life has already evolved
to resist ammonia toxicity.

12:36.838 --> 12:39.298
Once bees and other pollinators adapt,

12:39.380 --> 12:41.380
our model predicts vegetation growth

12:41.463 --> 12:44.673
will decontaminate the air
in less than 20 years.

12:47.296 --> 12:50.086
We take to the stars
in search of our salvation,

12:50.171 --> 12:51.961
but we fail to recognize

12:52.046 --> 12:55.706
that we are already on the most
significantly equipped spaceship.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.670
People can, and inevitably will,

12:59.755 --> 13:03.005
adapt and flourish again
on our beautiful planet.

13:05.088 --> 13:07.798
Don't lose yourself
looking into the darkness of space.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.710
Your home is shining blue
just in front of your eyes.

13:15.921 --> 13:19.171
Safe travels and hope
to welcome you here among us soon.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.710
Generally, the queen bee
is marked so she's easy to find.

15:59.296 --> 16:01.666
But sometimes she's replaced
during a season.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.171
In thousands of bees,
she blends in pretty well,

16:06.171 --> 16:09.801
but if you look closely, you'll notice
her thorax, her middle segment, is...

16:09.880 --> 16:11.840
is not like the worker bees...

16:15.213 --> 16:16.963
There's amazing news here, Sam.

16:17.671 --> 16:21.301
The council officially announced
the first New World Expedition.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.260
They chose Proxima Centauri.

16:23.755 --> 16:28.415
The exoplanet Proxima B
really is a near-identical Earth twin.

16:28.505 --> 16:30.295
It takes ten years to get there.

16:30.921 --> 16:34.131
All my friends are applying
for the mission. They need engineers.

16:35.671 --> 16:38.051
But it has grave implications
for the Exodus program.

16:38.130 --> 16:39.130
Damn it.

20:35.255 --> 20:37.835
The Council's decision
changes everything.

20:37.921 --> 20:41.131
Effective immediately,
all spacecraft personnel,

20:41.213 --> 20:42.633
energy, everything

20:42.713 --> 20:45.133
has been redirected
to the New World Expeditions.

20:46.171 --> 20:48.341
The Exodus shuttles
that are on Earth right now

20:48.421 --> 20:50.131
will launch in four days

20:50.213 --> 20:52.133
and will be the last ever sent to IO.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.713
You have to leave with your father, Sam.

20:57.046 --> 20:58.956
The universe is calling for us.

20:59.713 --> 21:00.713
Can't you hear it?

23:24.088 --> 23:26.708
A giant storm
hit our camp yesterday.

23:28.505 --> 23:31.835
My father's entire bee colony is gone.

23:33.463 --> 23:35.093
All the progress we'd made,

23:35.880 --> 23:37.760
dozens of new genetic strains,

23:38.380 --> 23:39.380
all lost.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.593
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

23:46.296 --> 23:49.626
Even if I accept that you might be right
about going to IO,

23:50.546 --> 23:53.546
we can't carry enough oxygen
with the ATVs.

23:55.005 --> 23:57.705
I don't think we could ever make it
to the launch site.

25:55.505 --> 25:57.455
I'm here for Dr. Harry Walden.

25:59.338 --> 26:01.168
I heard the radio transmission.

26:09.380 --> 26:10.510
Can I have some water?

26:48.546 --> 26:51.206
It's only cloudy like that
because of the charcoal.

26:52.338 --> 26:55.798
We filter our drinking water through sand
and charcoal. It's all it needs.

27:05.630 --> 27:06.630
Is he in there?

27:10.088 --> 27:11.918
I'm Dr. Walden's research assistant.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.600
I'm sure I can answer
any of your questions.

27:15.630 --> 27:17.420
I'm here to see Dr. Walden.

27:18.338 --> 27:19.548
Not you.

27:19.630 --> 27:20.960
Not anybody else.

27:43.671 --> 27:47.671
We haven't had anyone make the pilgrimage
to see Dr. Walden in a long time.

27:49.921 --> 27:50.921
Pilgrimage?

27:53.338 --> 27:54.668
Why you're here, isn't it?

27:58.421 --> 27:59.631
To meet Dr. Walden.

28:01.630 --> 28:03.210
Where did you say he was again?

28:04.296 --> 28:05.956
He's off in the mountain right now,

28:06.338 --> 28:08.088
gathering specimens for our work.

28:08.171 --> 28:09.761
I need you to take me to him.

28:10.296 --> 28:13.206
I can't. I don't know his exact location.

28:17.671 --> 28:18.711
Where's everyone else?

28:22.921 --> 28:23.921
There is no one else.

28:37.713 --> 28:38.713
I'll wait.

28:42.838 --> 28:44.008
You're going to Exodus.

28:46.505 --> 28:47.505
What?

28:48.046 --> 28:49.046
Your balloon.

28:51.088 --> 28:53.378
You're going
to the final Exodus launch to IO?

28:55.838 --> 28:56.838
That's right.

29:02.380 --> 29:04.880
It sure took you long enough
to decide to leave Earth.

29:06.546 --> 29:07.706
I'll fix you some food.

29:08.671 --> 29:09.671
No.

29:10.255 --> 29:12.505
I'm not gonna take any of your food.

29:12.588 --> 29:13.588
We have plenty.

29:20.588 --> 29:22.168
You have fresh vegetables?

29:23.588 --> 29:25.548
Yeah. I have an entire greenhouse.

29:39.255 --> 29:40.545
It's better with that.

29:55.463 --> 29:56.513
Huh.

30:03.921 --> 30:06.421
Do you know
if there's any animals left in the sea?

30:08.005 --> 30:10.125
I've always really wanted
to go to the ocean.

30:11.713 --> 30:12.713
No.

30:13.005 --> 30:14.005
There's nothing.

30:15.338 --> 30:16.588
There's nothing anywhere.

30:24.005 --> 30:25.295
Even the birds all died.

30:26.838 --> 30:28.628
You'd think they could
live up high like us.

30:28.713 --> 30:31.093
Yeah. Birds gotta land too, you know.

30:34.588 --> 30:35.918
Have you ever seen a swan?

30:40.796 --> 30:41.796
Yeah.

30:42.130 --> 30:43.710
Yeah, when I was a kid..

30:45.838 --> 30:46.838
Right.

30:48.130 --> 30:49.210
You're from before.

30:51.338 --> 30:52.338
Yeah.

30:54.338 --> 30:55.918
You've seen other cities?

30:56.505 --> 30:57.585
Just from the sky.

31:00.171 --> 31:01.461
Is it the same everywhere?

31:02.880 --> 31:04.460
Yeah, it's the same everywhere.

31:10.463 --> 31:12.689
I don't believe you.
No way you could've seen everywhere.

31:12.713 --> 31:14.633
When is Dr. Walden getting back?

31:17.838 --> 31:19.298
Sometimes he's gone for days.

31:38.421 --> 31:40.961
You have
a lot of electronic equipment in here.

31:44.838 --> 31:47.588
We scavenge
and salvage what we can from the zone.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.460
What are you doing?

31:50.546 --> 31:53.256
We're trying to establish
a variant breed of honeybees

31:53.338 --> 31:55.548
that can adapt to the toxic atmosphere.

31:55.630 --> 31:58.590
Immunogenics is
pretty fascinating actually.

31:58.671 --> 32:00.961
No, right now.
What are you doing right now?

32:01.713 --> 32:02.923
Oh, um...

32:03.963 --> 32:05.133
I'm writing a letter.

32:06.838 --> 32:08.958
What are you talking about? To who?

32:09.046 --> 32:10.416
Someone on the Colony.

32:13.838 --> 32:15.378
You have contact with IO?

32:16.588 --> 32:18.298
My friend Elon is an engineer

32:18.380 --> 32:21.050
working on the solar cell mission
to Alpha Centauri.

32:21.130 --> 32:24.090
He can access the main transmission link
between Earth and IO.

32:26.338 --> 32:28.668
You're gonna have to sleep
in here tonight.

32:29.588 --> 32:33.338
Dr. Walden's work is very important
and I can't have you interfering.

32:36.046 --> 32:37.796
Is that his room there?

32:39.130 --> 32:41.090
It's his office and living quarters.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.418
This is Dr. Harry Walden,

32:47.505 --> 32:50.375
transmitting on frequency 90-43,

32:50.463 --> 32:54.133
listening on frequency
95-60 kilohertz daily.

32:54.546 --> 32:57.336
That's 31 meters band frequency,

32:57.421 --> 32:59.711
- 95-60 kilohertz.
- Is that what I heard?

33:00.380 --> 33:01.380
A recording?

33:02.171 --> 33:03.421
It's protocol.

33:04.755 --> 33:06.505
When he's not here, I play the tape.

33:06.588 --> 33:08.758
So he's been gone more than two days?

33:10.838 --> 33:12.668
Uh... I guess that's right.

33:15.630 --> 33:17.260
He'll be back tomorrow probably.

33:19.296 --> 33:20.416
What's your name?

33:22.046 --> 33:23.046
Micah.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.005
I'm Sam.

33:30.046 --> 33:31.506
It's nice to meet you, Sam.

34:31.755 --> 34:33.295
Wanna make yourself useful?

34:49.963 --> 34:52.092
I have to repair a broken solar panel too.

34:54.963 --> 34:58.593
Should be able to seal it, but it'll never
put out as many amps as it used to.

34:59.671 --> 35:01.551
You do a lot of work around here.

35:04.338 --> 35:05.338
You have a rope?

35:25.255 --> 35:26.915
Looks pretty good, right?

35:36.171 --> 35:38.671
So, you know my friend Elon
I mentioned before?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.800
He's not really my friend.

35:42.380 --> 35:46.050
Well, he is, but he's,
you know, more than that.

35:46.130 --> 35:47.170
Is that right?

35:49.088 --> 35:50.378
How does that work?

35:50.963 --> 35:52.173
A lot of letters,

35:52.671 --> 35:53.711
a lot of, uh...

35:54.963 --> 35:55.963
loneliness.

35:56.963 --> 35:59.013
What about you? Do you have a wife?

35:59.588 --> 36:00.588
No.

36:03.546 --> 36:05.296
I guess you must think it's stupid.

36:07.255 --> 36:09.045
What?

36:10.130 --> 36:11.130
Me and Elon.

36:11.921 --> 36:12.921
I mean...

36:14.296 --> 36:18.706
Do you think it's absurd to love someone
that's millions of miles away?

36:20.796 --> 36:21.796
Not at all.

36:23.838 --> 36:27.878
So ancient is the desire for one another
which is implanted in us.

36:29.213 --> 36:31.633
Reuniting our original nature,

36:31.713 --> 36:33.843
seeking to make one of two

36:34.796 --> 36:36.376
and healing the state of man.

36:39.713 --> 36:40.713
What's that?

36:42.130 --> 36:43.130
Plato.

36:44.088 --> 36:45.338
Symposium.

36:52.088 --> 36:53.088
What does it mean?

36:58.005 --> 36:59.045
He says...

37:00.880 --> 37:03.510
humans originally had two faces.

37:04.463 --> 37:06.463
Four arms, four legs.

37:08.088 --> 37:09.588
And they were happy like that.

37:11.088 --> 37:12.088
Complete.

37:14.338 --> 37:16.258
Then they defied the gods,

37:17.338 --> 37:20.168
so the gods split us in two as punishment.

37:21.588 --> 37:23.918
Tore us away from our other halves.

37:27.296 --> 37:30.126
He said each of us, when separated,

37:30.213 --> 37:33.093
is always looking for our other half.

37:35.838 --> 37:36.838
It's our nature.

37:39.171 --> 37:41.381
But when one is met
with this other half...

37:43.505 --> 37:46.705
the pair are lost in an amazement of love,

37:47.505 --> 37:48.585
friendship,

37:49.713 --> 37:50.713
intimacy.

37:53.463 --> 37:56.263
And one will not be seen
out of the other's sight.

37:58.421 --> 37:59.841
See, the reason is...

38:01.130 --> 38:06.260
human nature was once originally one.

38:08.963 --> 38:09.963
And we were whole.

38:10.963 --> 38:14.213
And the desire
and the pursuit of the whole...

38:16.463 --> 38:17.713
is called love.

38:21.505 --> 38:22.505
Wow.

38:28.171 --> 38:29.801
You know a lot about this stuff.

38:31.255 --> 38:32.665
I was gonna be a teacher...

38:34.130 --> 38:35.130
once.

38:37.921 --> 38:39.671
I wasn't gonna tell you this...

38:43.963 --> 38:45.673
Harry Walden is my father.

38:47.546 --> 38:48.546
No.

38:49.255 --> 38:50.255
Really?

39:02.421 --> 39:03.461
Come with me.

39:06.963 --> 39:09.923
Bees used to do
almost all the pollinating, but...

39:11.213 --> 39:12.843
now I have to do it all by hand.

39:15.130 --> 39:17.340
- The three sisters.
- Yeah.

39:17.421 --> 39:19.671
Corn provides the structure
for the beans to climb,

39:19.755 --> 39:22.255
squash spreads out over the soil
like mulch,

39:22.338 --> 39:24.168
and that keeps the moisture in.

39:24.255 --> 39:26.755
And then the beans
provide the nitrogen in return.

39:27.838 --> 39:29.128
Everybody wins.

39:31.171 --> 39:32.591
What are those tattoos?

39:34.463 --> 39:36.213
E to the i pi plus one equals zero.

39:37.755 --> 39:39.005
It's Euler's equation.

39:40.296 --> 39:42.666
But this one's my absolute favorite.
It's, uh...

39:43.213 --> 39:45.053
Nowak's Evolvability Equation.

39:46.255 --> 39:49.085
Symbols on the left represent
all possible strings of molecules

39:49.171 --> 39:52.841
and symbols on the right represent
selection pressures and fitness ratings.

39:54.338 --> 39:58.628
Basically that just means, um...
all that's necessary for life to emerge

39:58.713 --> 40:02.383
are molecules subject to forces
of selection and mutation.

40:02.796 --> 40:05.876
If those conditions are met,
self-replication emerges.

40:11.171 --> 40:12.171
People can change.

40:17.380 --> 40:19.380
Don't you see how important that is?
I mean...

40:19.463 --> 40:21.713
What about the markings on your rib cage?

40:23.505 --> 40:27.045
Uh... It's nothing. It's just something
we do as part of our research.

40:28.921 --> 40:30.631
We do it to build up our immunity.

40:32.963 --> 40:33.963
Does it hurt?

40:36.046 --> 40:37.046
Not that bad.

40:53.838 --> 40:54.838
That's Lucy.

40:57.463 --> 40:58.633
How is that possible?

40:59.213 --> 41:00.463
It's complicated.

41:03.713 --> 41:04.923
You see, for my Dad...

41:06.421 --> 41:08.461
IO was just a last resort.

41:11.421 --> 41:12.421
A lifeboat.

41:15.296 --> 41:17.836
- What happened to Lucy?
- She died...

41:19.130 --> 41:20.130
eventually.

41:25.255 --> 41:26.295
She gave us hope.

41:35.171 --> 41:36.171
Wait.

41:37.713 --> 41:38.803
I wanna see this.

41:41.338 --> 41:44.128
Planet Earth
is a miracle in the universe.

41:44.213 --> 41:47.133
We are its caretakers,
and it is our duty to stay...

41:48.421 --> 41:51.091
stay and fight for our world.

41:51.755 --> 41:54.545
Humans may have nearly destroyed our home,

41:54.630 --> 41:57.260
but we can make it habitable again

41:57.338 --> 42:00.168
and we will breathe the air again.

42:02.046 --> 42:04.416
The strong, brave souls that will stay,

42:05.005 --> 42:06.705
if any do choose to stay,

42:07.380 --> 42:10.840
will become a new civilization
of its own design.

42:13.421 --> 42:15.301
A special thanks to Dr. Walden.

42:16.171 --> 42:17.301
A note to our viewers

42:17.755 --> 42:20.085
that this will be our final program

42:20.171 --> 42:24.131
due to the shut down of all broadcast
television from midnight tonight.

42:25.046 --> 42:26.456
There is too much to say,

42:26.963 --> 42:30.803
and I will end the program as I have
every day for the last eight years.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.960
From all of us, to all of you...

42:33.463 --> 42:34.803
See you tomorrow.

42:35.880 --> 42:36.880
Thank you.

43:23.963 --> 43:27.213
For a long time, you must've
thought it was the right thing to do.

43:28.838 --> 43:30.008
Staying on Earth.

43:31.005 --> 43:32.005
Right?

43:32.588 --> 43:33.878
For a long time.

43:36.838 --> 43:37.958
I was foolish.

43:41.838 --> 43:43.708
I think you were really brave.

43:46.046 --> 43:47.706
My dad would have thought so too.

44:27.171 --> 44:29.341
So I see you found
my parents' old bedroom.

44:30.671 --> 44:32.671
Your mother's name
was June, right?

44:34.130 --> 44:35.130
Yeah, that's right.

44:37.713 --> 44:38.713
How'd you know that?

44:42.380 --> 44:43.510
What did he do to her?

44:45.380 --> 44:46.380
What do you mean?

44:47.005 --> 44:49.505
What did Dr. Walden do
to cause your mother's death?

44:51.296 --> 44:52.376
My mom got sick.

44:54.255 --> 44:55.255
That's it.

44:56.213 --> 44:57.883
But he kept her here, right?

44:57.963 --> 44:59.593
- He kept all of you here.
- No.

45:00.338 --> 45:01.668
What do you mean "no"?

45:02.213 --> 45:05.763
Sam, she died because he kept her here.

45:11.505 --> 45:12.665
You're wasting my time.

45:14.713 --> 45:16.133
I have a lot of work to be doing.

45:23.671 --> 45:24.671
Micah!

45:26.046 --> 45:27.086
Open the door.

46:02.296 --> 46:03.796
Samantha, listen to me.

46:04.505 --> 46:07.335
It's not worth it,
you continuing my experiments.

46:07.421 --> 46:09.131
Dad, what are you doing in here?

46:09.213 --> 46:11.133
It's my lab, isn't it?

46:11.213 --> 46:13.673
You shouldn't be in here,
not without your oxygen.

46:14.130 --> 46:15.170
Sam, it's fine.

46:16.213 --> 46:18.423
You don't need to take care of me anymore.
I'm fine.

46:18.505 --> 46:19.875
No, you're not fine.

46:22.880 --> 46:23.880
Where have you been?

46:25.213 --> 46:26.213
Walking.

46:27.213 --> 46:28.303
Sam, it's...

46:29.755 --> 46:33.335
If there was a discovery, a miracle
discovery, I would've found it.

46:34.630 --> 46:35.710
What about Lucy?

46:43.296 --> 46:44.416
How are things with Elon?

46:47.338 --> 46:49.048
I'm not talking to you about that.

46:50.630 --> 46:51.630
Sam...

46:53.838 --> 46:55.958
Don't underestimate
the power of human connection.

46:56.713 --> 46:57.803
That's all there is.

46:59.421 --> 47:00.801
There is no bigger meaning.

47:01.546 --> 47:03.666
Just human connection.

47:03.755 --> 47:05.665
You used to say that about science.

47:08.630 --> 47:10.130
Sam, we have to leave this place.

47:13.005 --> 47:14.755
Sooner or later you'll have to.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.423
You're all alone here.

47:26.630 --> 47:27.630
I'm not alone.

47:28.755 --> 47:30.295
I don't count.

47:32.171 --> 47:33.171
Why not?

47:38.380 --> 47:39.380
I'm dead.

47:48.255 --> 47:50.125
My dad buried my mom here.

47:52.963 --> 47:54.423
I buried him here beside her.

47:59.588 --> 48:01.258
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

48:04.546 --> 48:07.706
I have to tell you something, Sam,
and you're not gonna like it.

48:10.171 --> 48:12.511
I've decided I'm taking you to Exodus.

48:13.755 --> 48:15.705
And I can get you there in the balloon.

48:16.421 --> 48:19.211
You won't understand it now,
but it's not up for debate.

48:20.005 --> 48:22.165
You've got your entire life ahead of you.

48:23.796 --> 48:25.956
And I'm not gonna leave you here alone.

48:30.130 --> 48:31.920
Do you understand what I'm saying?

48:33.213 --> 48:34.713
I'm taking you away from here.

48:36.796 --> 48:39.166
You're going to IO
and you're never coming back.

48:41.588 --> 48:42.588
Okay.

48:49.588 --> 48:50.588
Okay.

48:57.130 --> 48:58.130
Good.

49:04.880 --> 49:05.920
When do we leave?

49:09.838 --> 49:10.838
Soon.

49:13.005 --> 49:16.125
We'll have to plot our course
and wait for favorable wind conditions,

49:16.213 --> 49:17.423
but it has to be soon.

49:18.755 --> 49:21.585
We've a long way to travel
and we're running out of days.

50:18.130 --> 50:19.130
Elon.

50:20.088 --> 50:21.088
I have good news.

50:23.005 --> 50:26.835
A traveler arrived at the Enclave today
in a helium balloon.

50:27.963 --> 50:29.263
I thought I was dreaming.

50:30.713 --> 50:31.923
His name is Micah.

50:33.421 --> 50:39.051
I'm not even sure where he's from
or how he's survived this long on Earth.

50:41.671 --> 50:43.801
He's offered to take me to Exodus.

50:46.213 --> 50:47.263
And I've agreed.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.590
My life on Earth is over.

50:53.505 --> 50:55.295
It's been over for a long time.

50:57.380 --> 51:01.090
We'll finally be together on IO,
just like you've always wanted.

51:03.671 --> 51:05.631
Are there oceans on Centauri B?

51:10.088 --> 51:11.378
Write back soon, okay?

51:12.380 --> 51:13.960
I really need to hear from you.

51:55.588 --> 51:59.758
We're gonna have to wait for the wind
to change direction before we can leave.

51:59.838 --> 52:00.838
It will.

52:05.421 --> 52:08.091
What were you gonna do
if I hadn't shown up here, Sam?

52:09.380 --> 52:11.060
You know, people aren't meant to be alone.

52:13.713 --> 52:15.133
You think I don't know that?

52:27.630 --> 52:29.300
I'll go and get the rest of them.

52:50.671 --> 52:51.671
Fuck.

52:56.921 --> 52:58.261
Oh, fuck.

53:03.171 --> 53:04.551
You're never gonna believe this.

53:06.963 --> 53:08.093
Come on.

53:14.338 --> 53:15.338
That's how I found them.

53:16.088 --> 53:18.008
I think it's trapped under that grate.

53:19.921 --> 53:20.921
She.

53:22.505 --> 53:23.335
What?

53:23.421 --> 53:24.461
She's trapped.

53:26.671 --> 53:29.171
The holes are big enough
to let the workers and drones through,

53:29.255 --> 53:31.005
but they're too small for her.

53:34.005 --> 53:37.125
She must have just hatched,
which means she's a virgin queen.

53:45.171 --> 53:46.591
How is that possible?

53:50.338 --> 53:51.338
I don't know.

53:55.171 --> 53:56.301
So what does it mean?

54:05.213 --> 54:06.343
It doesn't mean anything.

54:49.921 --> 54:50.921
Sam...

54:51.838 --> 54:54.958
thank God you made the decision
to travel to the Exodus launch.

54:56.046 --> 54:58.416
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to write sooner,

54:58.505 --> 55:00.455
but there's been a change here as well.

55:03.213 --> 55:05.383
Yesterday my commanding officer
asked me to join

55:05.463 --> 55:08.173
the first New World Expedition shuttle.

55:09.963 --> 55:11.383
This morning I accepted.

55:12.338 --> 55:15.418
I hope you of all people
will understand that I had no choice.

55:18.963 --> 55:20.213
This is my destiny,

55:21.296 --> 55:22.296
my purpose.

55:24.421 --> 55:25.671
We can still be together,

55:27.130 --> 55:29.170
but it won't be for many, many years.

55:32.171 --> 55:33.921
Please write back before you leave.

55:34.921 --> 55:37.772
All transmission links with Earth
will be cut after the final Exodus launch

55:37.796 --> 55:41.256
and I am desperate to receive
one last letter from you before I leave.

55:46.546 --> 55:47.626
All my love,

55:48.380 --> 55:51.300
from IO until the end of the universe,

55:52.838 --> 55:53.838
Elon.

56:30.380 --> 56:32.210
You ever have squash spaghetti?

56:48.921 --> 56:50.011
What was it like?

56:52.505 --> 56:53.505
Before.

56:57.338 --> 56:59.668
I'm sure your father told you
what it was like.

57:02.255 --> 57:04.375
I want to know what it was like for you.

57:08.171 --> 57:09.171
Where are you from?

57:10.880 --> 57:12.590
I grew up in the suburbs.

57:14.380 --> 57:15.380
In a neighborhood.

57:18.921 --> 57:24.131
By the time I was old enough,
I was in the city every chance I got.

57:30.380 --> 57:31.760
We weren't ready for this.

57:34.588 --> 57:37.588
No matter what warning we got
from people like your father.

57:39.338 --> 57:41.008
What we saw with our own eyes.

57:44.838 --> 57:46.798
The future we got was unthinkable.

57:53.796 --> 57:54.796
For everybody.

58:00.755 --> 58:02.915
Unexpected things can be good too.

59:31.380 --> 59:32.380
Damn it!

59:34.505 --> 59:37.915
We'll never be able to get off the ground
if the wind doesn't change.

59:59.838 --> 01:00:00.838
Trust me.

01:00:05.421 --> 01:00:06.511
It'll change.

01:01:11.088 --> 01:01:12.168
That song.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.380
I remember that song.

01:02:11.088 --> 01:02:12.088
I'm sorry.

01:02:20.005 --> 01:02:21.005
It's okay.

01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:54.171
I can't.

01:03:03.838 --> 01:03:04.838
We have to.

01:03:31.338 --> 01:03:34.338
Do you see the glimmer?
To the left of Jupiter?

01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:38.461
Is that the Colony?

01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:41.546
It's the Colony.

01:03:44.838 --> 01:03:46.168
It's actually orbiting IO,

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:50.295
but the Colony's so much brighter
in the sky that IO becomes obscured.

01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.760
I never thought I'd see it.

01:04:06.755 --> 01:04:07.755
There's this...

01:04:09.921 --> 01:04:12.761
art exhibit I really wanted to see.

01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:16.130
An art exhibit?

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:20.758
The Museum of Art.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.010
It's one of the last exhibits from before.

01:04:28.546 --> 01:04:29.626
"Modern Myths."

01:04:32.796 --> 01:04:35.166
Would you have taught
your students about myths?

01:04:37.505 --> 01:04:38.505
Yeah.

01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:41.256
I think I would have.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.210
4.36 light years away.

01:04:54.588 --> 01:04:56.338
Is that the same as saying forever?

01:05:00.046 --> 01:05:05.876
The space between us will become more vast
until it's too far to cross.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.045
I've lied to you, Elon.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:15.050
My father's dead.

01:05:16.963 --> 01:05:19.013
He's been dead for a long time now.

01:05:20.755 --> 01:05:23.045
It was my decision, all along,

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.300
to stay on Earth.

01:05:29.255 --> 01:05:32.005
I think we're both looking
for worlds to call our own...

01:05:34.713 --> 01:05:35.923
but different ones.

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.050
I hope you find yours.

01:06:37.005 --> 01:06:39.045
Attention. Urgent notice.

01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.880
Due to catastrophic weather event,

01:06:40.963 --> 01:06:45.673
Exodus shuttle number 127
is unable to launch.

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:50.045
Your departure
has been changed to Exodus 134

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:54.840
at 49.5466 degrees

01:06:54.921 --> 01:06:59.801
by 16.4059 degrees.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:06.170
Exodus shuttles will begin embarkation
in 26 hours and 12 minutes.

01:07:11.338 --> 01:07:13.048
They moved the launch site.

01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.760
What are you talking about?
Is that a problem?

01:07:15.838 --> 01:07:18.298
We don't have enough helium
to fly that far!

01:07:18.713 --> 01:07:20.053
We're stuck here!

01:07:24.671 --> 01:07:25.671
It's never gonna end.

01:07:27.713 --> 01:07:29.013
I must be cursed.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:31.836
What do you mean?

01:07:33.171 --> 01:07:35.091
You wanna know why I really came here?

01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:38.671
Huh?

01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:41.711
Your father told us to stay on Earth.

01:07:43.463 --> 01:07:46.633
I saw dozens of people starve to death
because of him.

01:07:48.171 --> 01:07:49.671
Because he gave us hope.

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:57.920
My wife was sick.

01:08:01.171 --> 01:08:04.671
Food would have kept her alive
for a few more days, but...

01:08:05.963 --> 01:08:06.963
that was all.

01:08:08.713 --> 01:08:10.463
Then the food would have been gone.

01:08:18.837 --> 01:08:21.377
I hid rations so I could survive.

01:08:26.087 --> 01:08:27.877
I watched my wife die...

01:08:31.462 --> 01:08:33.053
so I could be the survivor.

01:08:35.921 --> 01:08:37.421
I couldn't live with that.

01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:42.875
So I came here to find him.

01:08:48.462 --> 01:08:50.593
And all I found was you instead.

01:09:00.587 --> 01:09:05.298
I won't make the same mistake twice
and let you die too.

01:09:19.505 --> 01:09:20.505
Thank you.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.923
Thank you for telling me, Micah.

01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:42.260
I know where we can get helium.

01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:47.212
It's in the zone.

01:09:49.837 --> 01:09:50.877
It's really far.

01:09:52.837 --> 01:09:54.508
It's farther than I've ever gone.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.050
We'd have to stay longer
than I've ever stayed before.

01:10:04.338 --> 01:10:06.298
We'd need to stay the night there.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.050
It's not possible, Sam.

01:10:09.213 --> 01:10:10.213
It's possible.

01:10:12.796 --> 01:10:13.796
I think.

01:10:15.921 --> 01:10:17.011
Adapt or die.

01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.421
Isn't that what they say?

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:51.050
This is Sam Walden.

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.090
Transmitting on a frequency
90.43 kilohertz daily.

01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:02.671
If anyone's still listening
to these broadcasts...

01:11:03.796 --> 01:11:05.256
...Doctor Harry Walden,

01:11:05.671 --> 01:11:09.801
my father, mentor, and best friend,

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880
has died.

01:11:12.338 --> 01:11:16.628
On October 13th of last year,
I buried him next to my mother.

01:11:29.921 --> 01:11:31.011
What about here?

01:11:31.755 --> 01:11:33.455
You ever been to this part before?

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:38.380
Yeah.

01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:41.588
Should work. It's just a big open field.

01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:44.841
We'll drop the balloon there.
Then we'll go get the helium.

01:11:50.046 --> 01:11:51.256
Museum of Art.

01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:57.921
What?

01:11:57.963 --> 01:11:58.843
Nothing.

01:11:58.921 --> 01:11:59.921
What?

01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:02.763
I just need you to focus.

01:12:03.796 --> 01:12:05.546
We mess up and we die.

01:12:07.088 --> 01:12:08.258
I am focused.

01:12:11.046 --> 01:12:13.546
This afternoon,
I'll be leaving our enclave

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.800
to travel to the Exodus launch site.

01:12:17.588 --> 01:12:21.668
If anyone's receiving this broadcast,
I implore you to do the same.

01:12:23.713 --> 01:12:27.303
We thought we could find a way
for humans to survive on Earth.

01:12:29.713 --> 01:12:30.713
We were wrong.

01:12:31.713 --> 01:12:34.423
This is Sam Walden, over and out.

01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:40.875
Why are we stopped?

01:13:41.546 --> 01:13:43.006
It's incredible, right?

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.713
It's a graveyard, Sam.

01:13:48.296 --> 01:13:49.796
All I see are ghosts.

01:13:59.171 --> 01:14:00.921
We're near the launch spot.

01:14:01.671 --> 01:14:05.261
Let's drop the balloon and get moving.
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:10.256
Sam!

01:15:10.796 --> 01:15:12.666
- What?
- There's a lot of helium in here.

01:15:13.296 --> 01:15:14.296
I know.

01:15:17.296 --> 01:15:20.256
But that's a good thing, right?
It's why we came.

01:15:20.755 --> 01:15:22.125
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:15:22.213 --> 01:15:23.463
So, come on.

01:15:24.088 --> 01:15:25.088
Give me a hand.

01:15:28.296 --> 01:15:31.876
All right. We get a few more,
and then we camp here for the night.

01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:34.710
It's getting too dark to travel.

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:44.505
So you know
how life started on this planet?

01:15:45.838 --> 01:15:47.208
Was it a bacteria?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.960
Yeah.

01:15:49.046 --> 01:15:52.046
They came out of the ocean,
and here we are...

01:15:52.588 --> 01:15:54.418
at the very end of this cycle.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.800
Do you realize that you might be
the last woman to live on Earth?

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.010
I'm sure
there are other people alive.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:03.260
Yeah, on the Colony,

01:16:03.796 --> 01:16:05.506
working hard to find our new home,

01:16:06.546 --> 01:16:09.296
where you won't need a gas mask
to take me to a restaurant.

01:16:16.296 --> 01:16:18.256
Now, how does this work?

01:16:19.213 --> 01:16:21.213
Once we switch to fresh tanks,

01:16:21.296 --> 01:16:23.506
we turn the air valve down 50%.

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:25.706
We try to relax.

01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:28.130
We should be okay.

01:16:28.921 --> 01:16:30.421
You set your alarm?

01:16:30.505 --> 01:16:31.505
Yes.

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:34.171
Let's do this.

01:16:50.588 --> 01:16:52.298
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

01:17:48.088 --> 01:17:49.338
I'll be right back.

01:17:51.046 --> 01:17:52.046
Sam.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:56.380
Sam.

01:17:59.505 --> 01:18:00.795
We leave in one hour.

01:18:02.421 --> 01:18:03.591
Yeah.

01:18:03.671 --> 01:18:04.711
I know.

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:45.256
We have to go, Sam.

01:21:49.046 --> 01:21:51.876
"A shudder in the loins engenders there.

01:21:53.338 --> 01:21:54.798
The broken wall,

01:21:55.755 --> 01:21:57.545
the burning roof and tower.

01:22:00.005 --> 01:22:01.755
And Agamemnon dead.

01:22:03.796 --> 01:22:06.666
So mastered by the brute blood of the air.

01:22:08.463 --> 01:22:11.963
Did she put on his knowledge
with his power

01:22:13.546 --> 01:22:16.296
before the indifferent beak
could let her drop?"

01:22:21.463 --> 01:22:22.463
Sam.

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:26.050
Tell me what it means.

01:22:31.130 --> 01:22:33.010
Leda gave birth to Helen.

01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:36.261
Helen of Troy.

01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:41.921
A face that launched a thousand ships.

01:22:46.671 --> 01:22:49.511
She was considered
the most beautiful woman in the world.

01:22:53.005 --> 01:22:54.835
Her abduction by Paris,

01:22:55.713 --> 01:22:56.843
the Prince of Troy...

01:22:58.838 --> 01:23:00.458
brought upon the Trojan War.

01:23:02.963 --> 01:23:04.213
The broken wall,

01:23:05.338 --> 01:23:07.048
the burning roof and tower,

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.420
and Agamemnon dead.

01:23:13.796 --> 01:23:16.126
Leda was related to the gods.

01:23:19.921 --> 01:23:21.381
And the swan is Zeus.

01:23:25.463 --> 01:23:26.463
Zeus in disguise.

01:23:28.963 --> 01:23:31.133
Leda gave birth to God's children.

01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:52.260
You did everything you could.

01:23:57.046 --> 01:23:58.756
Your father would be proud of you.

01:24:08.130 --> 01:24:09.130
Let's go.

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:12.005
Okay?

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.340
I'm not going with you.

01:24:32.005 --> 01:24:33.835
You're gonna have to go on your own.

01:25:01.921 --> 01:25:03.211
Change your tank.

01:25:07.838 --> 01:25:10.128
We can talk about it at the launch site.

01:25:29.546 --> 01:25:31.336
I keep having this dream...

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:34.130
where I'm in the zone...

01:25:35.713 --> 01:25:36.713
and...

01:25:36.796 --> 01:25:38.666
I'm not wearing a mask.

01:25:47.671 --> 01:25:49.801
I strike my lighter and...

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.300
it's dark purple.

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:00.755
But I'm fine.

01:26:04.213 --> 01:26:06.303
Everyone sees so much death here...

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:11.460
but I see life.

01:26:20.671 --> 01:26:23.961
Why are you doing this, Sam?
Change your tank.

01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:29.803
Promise me something.

01:26:32.046 --> 01:26:34.796
If I survive, tell everyone on IO
that there's a future on Earth.

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.590
Sam! Sam!

01:26:37.463 --> 01:26:38.463
Sam!

01:26:41.005 --> 01:26:42.005
I'm okay.

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:46.130
It's okay.

01:26:47.963 --> 01:26:48.963
It's okay.

01:27:41.463 --> 01:27:42.513
Dear Micah,

01:27:44.838 --> 01:27:47.088
my father loved the T.S Eliot quote,

01:27:48.505 --> 01:27:50.835
"We shall not cease from exploration,

01:27:51.713 --> 01:27:54.133
and the end of all of our exploring

01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:56.958
will be to arrive where we started

01:27:57.463 --> 01:27:59.423
and know the place for the first time."

01:28:03.088 --> 01:28:04.918
We have learned to fear our planet

01:28:05.796 --> 01:28:08.256
and fled to the stars
in search of a new one.

01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:13.705
But the fascination for other worlds

01:28:13.796 --> 01:28:17.416
could not turn my eyes away
from the beauty of our home.

01:28:23.338 --> 01:28:25.258
The waves are crashing on the shore...

01:28:29.255 --> 01:28:31.125
and the wind is blowing in my hair.

01:28:35.671 --> 01:28:37.131
Tell them it feels good.

01:28:40.296 --> 01:28:43.506
Tell them the dark clouds have given way
to the ocean mist.

01:28:47.838 --> 01:28:49.838
Tell them a new world awaits us.

01:28:55.005 --> 01:28:56.625
Tell them we're waiting for you.

01:29:00.671 --> 01:29:02.341
Waiting for you to come back.
