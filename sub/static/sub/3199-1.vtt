And last, I would just like to say

01:14.690 --> 01:18.325
good luck in this new
chapter of our lives.

01:18.327 --> 01:20.060
Excuse the cliche,

01:20.062 --> 01:22.596
but they say that time flies
when you're having fun.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.999
And I don't know about you guys,

01:25.001 --> 01:30.437
but I have had the best time of
my life here at Madison college.

01:30.439 --> 01:32.706

01:32.708 --> 01:34.308

What a douche.

01:48.057 --> 01:50.257
- Bring it in here, girls.
- Why do I get the feeling

01:50.259 --> 01:52.192
we'll be calling Bob
senator one day?

01:52.194 --> 01:54.728
In 20 years, that guy's
gonna be the president.

01:54.730 --> 01:56.597
Everybody's having a good time.

01:56.599 --> 01:59.066
I'm already having a good time.

02:00.368 --> 02:02.069
- Dude.
- Hey!

02:02.071 --> 02:03.704
Don't start with me.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.340
Look, the first semester,
she was totally single,

02:06.342 --> 02:08.776
and you were actually the
first person to meet her.

02:08.777 --> 02:11.779
Yeah, I know.
I know I blew it, okay?

02:11.781 --> 02:14.281
I mean, usually I got
pretty good game.

02:14.283 --> 02:17.418
But, you know, I get around
Elizabeth and I get all loopy.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.219
Yeah, well...

02:19.221 --> 02:21.088
Speaking of game, how'd the
breakup go with Rosie?

02:21.090 --> 02:22.423
What do you mean, how'd it go?

02:22.425 --> 02:24.358
- She kicked me in the nuts.
- Ooh. Were you wearing?

02:24.360 --> 02:25.626
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:25.628 --> 02:27.094
- You had to know that was coming.
- Oh, yeah.

02:27.096 --> 02:29.196
- Oh, here she comes.
- Hi, guys.

02:29.198 --> 02:30.697
Hey!

02:30.699 --> 02:32.599
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:32.601 --> 02:34.201
What are you guys talking about?

02:34.203 --> 02:35.803
- Baseball and...
- Oh.

02:35.805 --> 02:37.671
- Guy stuff?
- Yeah.

02:37.673 --> 02:39.773
- So macho.
- Yeah.

02:39.775 --> 02:42.276
Yeah, let me get...
who wants a beer?

02:42.278 --> 02:43.844
- Yeah, I'll have...
- Beer? Two beers, three beers?

02:43.846 --> 02:46.513
I'm okay. Thank you.

02:46.515 --> 02:49.683
So... Tomorrow's graduation.

02:49.685 --> 02:51.351
It's crazy, right?

02:51.353 --> 02:53.253
I know, right? It's like four years

02:53.255 --> 02:55.322
- went by like that.
- Yeah.

02:55.324 --> 02:57.791
You should fly to visit
me in San Diego.

02:57.793 --> 02:58.625
Mm...

02:58.627 --> 03:00.394
Yeah, I don't know.

03:00.396 --> 03:03.330
You don't... you don't know
if you wanna come see me?

03:03.332 --> 03:05.732
No, no, it's not...
it's not what you think.

03:05.734 --> 03:08.402
It's... You know. What I told you.

03:08.404 --> 03:11.839
- Oh, the claustrophobia stuff.
- Yes, I...

03:11.841 --> 03:13.807
I kinda thought you were
kidding about that.

03:13.809 --> 03:15.375
No. I don't kid about that.

03:15.377 --> 03:17.611
I thought it was just elevators
and things like that.

03:17.613 --> 03:21.113
Yeah, it is, but then it kicks in
pretty good about 35,000 feet.

03:21.156 --> 03:24.159
The whole fear of plunging
to a fiery, screaming death

03:24.220 --> 03:26.854
- tends to amplify it a bit.
- Right.

03:26.856 --> 03:28.422
We can talk about something else.

03:28.424 --> 03:31.358
Sure. But I do want you
to come visit me.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.560
- Okay.
- Lizzie!

03:33.562 --> 03:36.363
Um, hold on one second.

03:36.365 --> 03:39.566
I guess maybe one regret
that I have is that,

03:39.568 --> 03:43.270
you know, with all the stupid
boyfriends and girlfriends

03:43.272 --> 03:48.242
that we both had that you
and I never gave it a shot.

03:49.410 --> 03:51.211
Let's make a deal, Mitch.

03:51.213 --> 03:54.715
In ten years, if we haven't
married other people,

03:54.717 --> 03:58.619
we marry each other.
What do you say?

03:58.621 --> 04:01.722
Lizzie! We're gonna
leave without you.

04:01.724 --> 04:03.590
Okay. Hold on.

04:03.592 --> 04:06.727
- What do you say?
- Sure!

04:06.729 --> 04:10.464
- I love you so much, Mitch.
- I love you too.

04:11.799 --> 04:14.468
Okay. I'll see you soon.

04:14.470 --> 04:16.803
Okay.

04:16.805 --> 04:19.473
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:22.577 --> 04:24.778
Huh? So?

04:24.780 --> 04:26.446
How'd it go?

04:26.448 --> 04:31.285
To be honest, I think
I just got engaged.

04:32.887 --> 04:35.589
Now listen, I know what
you're all thinking.

04:35.591 --> 04:38.225
Yeah, right, he's gonna wait
ten years to marry her.

04:38.227 --> 04:40.861
I will admit, I did think about it.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.429
For about a month.

04:42.431 --> 04:45.732
Now, as you can see, when
I go on the first date,

04:45.734 --> 04:47.801
I got it down pretty good.
I mean,

04:47.803 --> 04:50.504
look at the way they
laugh at my jokes.

04:50.506 --> 04:51.872
You can't fake that.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.308
Although with women, you
never really can tell.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.944
But first date...
I'm king.

04:56.946 --> 04:59.546
When we get a little deeper
in the relationship...

04:59.548 --> 05:02.583
Mitch, this is the best
birthday dinner ever.

05:02.585 --> 05:04.585
You'd better be careful, mister.

05:04.587 --> 05:07.921
I might just use the "I" word tonight.
That's when things go kablooey.

05:07.923 --> 05:10.257
It's your birthday?

05:12.528 --> 05:14.962
Don't ever call me again.

05:14.964 --> 05:19.433
For the last time, my name is
Eleanor, not Elizabeth, jerk!

05:20.602 --> 05:24.004
Well, ten years later,
I'm still single.

05:24.006 --> 05:26.873
And I heard that Elizabeth
already got married,

05:26.875 --> 05:30.477
so I guess it's just
not meant to be.

05:37.452 --> 05:39.453
Okay.

05:39.455 --> 05:41.288
This is from me.

05:42.423 --> 05:45.525
- Thank you, Karen.
- Happy Birthday, Mitch.

05:45.527 --> 05:47.561
Thank you. Oh, my gosh.

05:47.563 --> 05:51.398
Oh, come on. Look at that.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.767
Nice watch. What'd that run you?

05:53.769 --> 05:56.336
Easy! Thank you, Karen.

05:56.338 --> 05:57.904
You're welcome.

05:57.906 --> 06:02.542
Seriously, I, uh, I feel truly
blessed to have friends like you.

06:02.544 --> 06:05.312
Are these wonderful gifts
are just too much, so...

06:05.314 --> 06:07.581
- You're welcome!
- Thank you.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.317
Most of you.

06:10.319 --> 06:13.620
Is this a party, or what?

06:14.757 --> 06:16.390
Look at you!
You made it!

06:16.392 --> 06:18.292
Hey, dude, I took the
last ferry from Montauk,

06:18.294 --> 06:20.327
- got here in no time.
- And yet, you never visit.

06:20.329 --> 06:23.730
- Nice hat.
- Thank you very much.

06:23.732 --> 06:27.467
This is my good friend Dave
Breem from college, everybody.

06:27.469 --> 06:30.504
This a birthday party or a funeral?

06:30.506 --> 06:31.638
- Come on!
- Funeral.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.508
Hey, hey, hey, easy. Now, who
scored this month's bonus

06:34.510 --> 06:36.710
and is picking up
tonight's check, huh?

06:36.712 --> 06:39.079
- To Mitch.
- To Mitch.

06:39.081 --> 06:40.447
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Salud.</i>

06:40.449 --> 06:41.882
Waitress!

06:41.884 --> 06:44.051
Another round. Cheap stuff?

06:44.053 --> 06:46.353
Good night, ladies!

06:46.355 --> 06:51.425
Hey, guys, it's last call. Would you like
anything else before I close out your tab?

06:51.427 --> 06:53.860
No, I think just the check, thanks.

06:53.862 --> 06:55.028
Uh, um...

06:55.030 --> 06:59.099
I would like to buy me and my
buddy two shots of whiskey.

06:59.401 --> 07:02.069
Why don't you, uh...
Keep the change?

07:02.071 --> 07:03.970
Huh?

07:03.972 --> 07:06.373
You always know the
right thing to do, man.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.775
That is because I'm the
Ying to your Yang.

07:08.777 --> 07:09.876
Oh!

07:09.878 --> 07:11.845
What? Oh, my... dude.

07:11.847 --> 07:13.013
Happy Birthday.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.115
- Come on!
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.117 --> 07:17.017
You kept this?

07:17.019 --> 07:18.852
Ten years, man.
How you holding up?

07:18.854 --> 07:21.655
Eh.

07:21.657 --> 07:22.923
Man, if she only waited,

07:22.925 --> 07:26.393
we would have been great together.

07:26.395 --> 07:28.028
Yeah, I know.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.030
Eh. Stupid to think
a girl like her

07:30.032 --> 07:32.532
can go ten years and
not find somebody.

07:32.534 --> 07:34.368
I mean, it's not like I didn't try.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.670
I mean, I scoured the
Internet, you know?

07:36.672 --> 07:38.972
Facebook, Twitter...
nothing.

07:38.974 --> 07:40.674
This woman's off the grid.
Thank you.

07:40.676 --> 07:43.009
Well, what if I told you...

07:43.011 --> 07:45.011
oh, my God, who ordered the cabo?

07:45.013 --> 07:47.547
Seriously, I said
bottom shelf, guys!

07:47.549 --> 07:49.816
You know what?
I bet you it was damn Carl.

07:49.818 --> 07:51.151
Dude, would you stop?
In two seconds,

07:51.153 --> 07:52.753
you're not even gonna
care about that.

07:52.755 --> 07:53.954
Yeah, that I'd like.

07:53.956 --> 07:55.422
Then this you'll love.

07:55.424 --> 07:57.157
- You sitting down?
- Yeah, Dave.

07:57.159 --> 07:59.126
- I'm sitting down.
- Okay, okay.

07:59.128 --> 08:02.462
She never got married.

08:02.464 --> 08:04.798
- No way.
- Yes, way!

08:04.800 --> 08:06.867
No, no, no, 'cause I read
in the alumni mag...

08:06.869 --> 08:08.568
are you messing with me?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.837
- I'm not messing with you.
- Don't mess with me.

08:10.839 --> 08:12.839
I'm not messing with you.
In fact, I'm trying to help you.

08:12.841 --> 08:14.741
I read the same thing too.
But I called the alumni office.

08:14.743 --> 08:16.476
She never got married.

08:16.478 --> 08:19.446
This is her last known
address in San Diego.

08:19.448 --> 08:22.816
San Diego.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.684
Happy Birthday!

08:24.686 --> 08:26.553
- It's meant to be, man!
- This might be meant to be.

08:26.555 --> 08:28.989
- This is really meant to be.
- This might be meant to be.

08:28.991 --> 08:31.158
I'll drink to that.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.860
- Mmm!
- Oh, my God.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.861
- Ugh...
- Give me my change!

08:35.864 --> 08:38.597
Dude, there's such better
Mexican in this town.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.534
Why do you keep going to this dump?

08:40.535 --> 08:42.102
'Cause it's got...
it's fiesta hour.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.736
We got, you know, free drinks.

08:43.739 --> 08:45.005
Uhh... But it's... ugh.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.474
So what are you gonna do?

08:47.476 --> 08:49.209
Be honest?

08:49.211 --> 08:52.646
Probably same thing
I've always done... nothing.

08:52.648 --> 08:54.448
Can I be honest?

08:54.450 --> 08:57.017
That's stupid, man.
Come on... go after the girl!

08:57.019 --> 09:01.054
She lives a long way away, and
I am terrified of flying.

09:01.056 --> 09:03.089
Then drive.

09:03.091 --> 09:04.991
What about my job?

09:04.993 --> 09:06.793
- You hate your job.
- What about my fish?

09:06.795 --> 09:09.129
- I'll feed your fish.
- What about my plants?

09:09.131 --> 09:11.698
- I'll water 'em.
- What if she

09:11.700 --> 09:13.834
- doesn't love me back?
- Well, what if she

09:13.836 --> 09:15.035
- love me back?
- All right.

09:15.037 --> 09:17.070
You're an animal.

09:17.072 --> 09:19.039
Come on, man.
What if she does?

09:19.041 --> 09:23.710
You'll never know unless you get
in this car and go find out.

09:26.682 --> 09:27.781
Yo, yo!

09:27.783 --> 09:29.049
Thanks for the cocktails!

09:29.051 --> 09:30.817
- Carl?
- Yeah.

09:30.819 --> 09:32.586
- Douche.
- Douche.

09:32.588 --> 09:34.187
We're heading to Val's.
You and your buddy wanna come?

09:34.189 --> 09:36.089
Yeah, Mitch, come on.
Come for a night cap.

09:36.091 --> 09:38.792
Yeah, Mitch.
Come!

09:40.495 --> 09:42.729
I'm gonna have to pass.

09:42.731 --> 09:44.097
What, do you got
something better to do?

09:44.099 --> 09:47.133
Yes, I do.

Wow, you're a long

11:52.660 --> 11:55.161
- Hey, there.
- Uh, hi.

11:55.163 --> 11:57.831
- Where ya headed?
- Uh, San Diego.

11:57.833 --> 12:01.034
You look exhausted.
How long you been driving?

12:01.036 --> 12:03.136
Sheesh.
About 11 hours.

12:03.138 --> 12:05.105
What's your name, patriot?

12:05.107 --> 12:06.339
- Mitch.
- Hey, Mitch.

12:06.341 --> 12:08.174
Nice to meet ya.
I'm Laura.

12:08.176 --> 12:10.777
- Hi.
- You know, I run

12:10.779 --> 12:12.846
a bed and breakfast
just up the road.

12:12.848 --> 12:15.181
Oh, well, uh...
That's okay.

12:15.183 --> 12:17.384
Come on.
I didn't meant to startle ya.

12:17.386 --> 12:20.220
But you just look too
cute not to meet.

12:20.222 --> 12:23.023
I got a nice bed and a hot shower.

12:23.025 --> 12:24.924
I was even gonna cook.

12:24.926 --> 12:26.693
You like spicy?

12:26.695 --> 12:29.162
Yeah, I don't know.

12:30.831 --> 12:33.266
Mmm. Oh, my gosh.

12:33.268 --> 12:35.669
That was fantastic.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.804
- Thank you.
- That's sweet.

12:37.806 --> 12:39.739
- There's more if you like.
- After 11 hours of driving

12:39.741 --> 12:42.175
and three glasses of wine
and a meal like that...

12:42.177 --> 12:44.778
Just point me to bed.
I am done.

12:44.780 --> 12:47.981
Mmm. Bed.
That sounds real nice.

12:47.983 --> 12:49.349
Oh...

12:49.351 --> 12:52.118
You really are cute.

12:57.793 --> 12:59.092
Don't move.

12:59.094 --> 13:01.728
Wh...

13:01.730 --> 13:03.830
hello.

13:03.832 --> 13:05.732
Oh, hey, Rudy.

13:05.734 --> 13:07.000
It's my brother.

13:07.002 --> 13:08.935
It'll just be a sec.

13:08.937 --> 13:10.737
- Okay.
- Really?

13:10.739 --> 13:13.039
That's kinda last minute.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.842
But I have a guest here.

13:16.944 --> 13:19.979
All right, I'll see ya in a bit.

13:22.416 --> 13:24.851
My brother and his friends
get together once a week

13:24.853 --> 13:28.054
and they lost their
usual place, so...

13:28.056 --> 13:30.123
He asked if he could come here.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.992
But I said he had to be real quiet.

13:32.994 --> 13:33.494
Um...

13:39.901 --> 13:42.402
I'll just...

13:42.404 --> 13:44.738
- Probably...
- Okay.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.439
Who is she, and what's her name?

13:46.441 --> 13:49.042
What do you mean?

13:49.044 --> 13:50.944
Uh...

13:50.946 --> 13:52.412
Elizabeth.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.949
I haven't seen her since college,
and we made this pact back then

13:55.951 --> 13:57.784
that if we weren't
married in ten years,

13:57.786 --> 13:59.285
we were gonna marry each other.

13:59.287 --> 14:04.324
So here it is ten years later, and, uh...
I'm gonna track her down.

14:04.326 --> 14:09.095
You made the old friend
college ten-year pact?

14:09.097 --> 14:11.364
Sounds kinda dumb when
you say it like that.

14:11.366 --> 14:13.066
No, it is kinda dumb.

14:13.068 --> 14:16.302
Maybe, but...
I have to try.

14:16.304 --> 14:20.473
Are you sure?

14:20.475 --> 14:23.910
If I had a nickel for every time
a beautiful woman like yourself

14:23.912 --> 14:26.980
tried to take me to bed,
including right now...

14:26.982 --> 14:28.148
You'd have a nickel?

14:28.150 --> 14:29.482
Maybe a dime.

14:29.484 --> 14:33.853
Well, she's lucky to have you,
even if she doesn't know it.

14:33.855 --> 14:35.355
Thank you.

14:35.357 --> 14:39.559
I would love to find some guy
to take me away from this life.

14:39.561 --> 14:42.796
You? I'm sure you have
plenty of offers.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.231
I seem to be attracted to losers.

14:47.335 --> 14:49.035
Wait a minute.

14:49.037 --> 14:51.838
Did she just call me a loser?

14:51.840 --> 14:54.374
I haven't felt that awkward
since my first day of college.

14:57.379 --> 14:59.112
- Here we go.
- Whoop! Yeah.

14:59.114 --> 15:00.580
- College!
- All right!

15:00.582 --> 15:04.050
Got in.

15:08.022 --> 15:09.155
- Mitch.
- Oh.

15:09.157 --> 15:11.191
- I'm Dave.
- Hey.

15:11.193 --> 15:13.126
- Cool!
- Okay, all right.

15:13.128 --> 15:15.094
This'll work.

15:17.131 --> 15:20.166
Now that that's settled,
I'm gonna go take a whiz.

15:20.168 --> 15:22.569
- College!
- College.

15:40.021 --> 15:42.621
O-ma-o-ma-my-ma...

15:48.129 --> 15:53.166
O-ma-o-ma-my-ma...

15:53.168 --> 15:55.134
What the f...

16:04.079 --> 16:07.213
Aah! Ohh!

16:07.215 --> 16:10.149
Ohh!

16:10.151 --> 16:12.185
Mitch?

16:12.187 --> 16:15.922
A-are you all right?

16:15.924 --> 16:17.891
I'm fine.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.092
Thank you.

16:19.094 --> 16:23.029
I thought I heard a crash in there.

16:23.031 --> 16:24.964
Uh...

16:24.966 --> 16:27.533
I just dropped some
change on the table.

16:27.535 --> 16:29.135
I'm good.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.671
Honey, can you open
the door, please?

16:31.673 --> 16:33.206
Ohh...

16:33.208 --> 16:35.475
Coming.

16:35.477 --> 16:38.177
Ohh... Ooh.

16:42.016 --> 16:45.051
See? All good.

16:45.053 --> 16:48.388
Actually, I'm glad you're awake.

16:48.390 --> 16:50.523
Oh, really?

16:50.525 --> 16:53.092
My brother and his
friends are outside,

16:53.094 --> 16:56.062
- and he'd like to meet you.
- Your brother what?

16:56.064 --> 16:58.131
- He'd like to meet you.
- Do you think

16:58.133 --> 17:00.566
that's a good idea?
I mean, he seems...

17:00.568 --> 17:03.303
Pretty busy with the boys and all.

17:03.305 --> 17:07.205
Laura! Get your sorry butt
out here with your friend now.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.375
Rudy, don't push me!

17:09.377 --> 17:13.980
Mitch is getting dressed <i>and
will be out in a minute!</i>

17:13.982 --> 17:15.982
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

17:15.983 --> 17:19.152
If you could...
If you could just get dressed

17:19.154 --> 17:23.455
and come out with me, it
would be really great.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.425
I'll be out in a sec.

17:25.426 --> 17:27.993
Okay.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.531
I'm dead!

17:34.469 --> 17:37.370
I knew about you as
soon as I met you.

17:37.372 --> 17:39.238
As did I you, sir.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.374
- Sir.
- Sir?

17:41.376 --> 17:42.575
Well, look out, everybody.

17:42.577 --> 17:44.544
Here comes sir Rudy!

17:49.016 --> 17:52.585
Well, I gotta get going.
Got a long drive ahead of me.

17:52.587 --> 17:56.022
Hey, listen, we are gonna be out
in Zuma in the next couple weeks.

17:56.024 --> 17:57.557

18:10.038 --> 18:12.772
I know he can be an obnoxious jerk.

18:12.774 --> 18:15.408

18:55.650 --> 18:57.583

18:57.585 --> 19:01.754
Only two things in Texas...

19:01.756 --> 19:04.057
How's it going?
You got a number for me?

19:04.059 --> 19:06.626
Sorry, but you're really...
Not gonna like this.

19:06.628 --> 19:08.394
Aw, dude, after the night I had,

19:08.396 --> 19:10.797
it's not even gonna matter.
Just shoot.

19:10.799 --> 19:14.567
Yeah, she doesn't live
in, um, San Diego.

19:14.569 --> 19:17.170
She lives in Hawaii.
Hawaii?

19:17.172 --> 19:19.172
Yeah, dude, Hawaii.
But look, you can do this.

19:19.174 --> 19:21.107
How am I gonna get to Hawaii?

19:21.109 --> 19:22.742
- Is there a boat?
- No, dude.

19:22.744 --> 19:24.677
Not unless you want
to spend $5,000.

19:24.679 --> 19:26.279
But you can take a flight.

19:28.783 --> 19:31.084
What the...

19:32.319 --> 19:34.120
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

19:34.122 --> 19:36.155
I will book you... come here.
I'll book you a ticket.

19:36.157 --> 19:39.792
Right there. Perfect, baby, just...
all right, look, just book it.

19:39.794 --> 19:43.529
And I got the number of a smoking
hot woman I'll give you, okay?

19:43.531 --> 19:45.364
Oh, really?
One sec.

19:47.469 --> 19:48.601
Just book the ticket.

19:48.603 --> 19:51.270
All right, okay.
Guess what.

19:51.272 --> 19:53.706
All right, one second.
Ooh... Pow!

19:53.708 --> 19:55.808
All right, mm-hmm.

19:55.810 --> 19:58.845
You owe me $600.

19:58.847 --> 20:00.379
- Fine.
- Call you back.

20:00.381 --> 20:03.382
I'm in the middle of something.
Safe flight.

20:03.384 --> 20:05.218
Ooh! Hit me one time.

20:09.756 --> 20:12.758
We got you in 21b.
It's a middle seat.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.694
Apologize.
That's all we have.

20:14.696 --> 20:19.165
Have a good flight.
Mahalo.

20:20.234 --> 20:21.801
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.270
Please make sure you are
with your bags at all times.

20:24.272 --> 20:27.240
Do not leave bags unattended.

20:30.310 --> 20:31.677
You okay?

20:31.679 --> 20:34.647
'Cause you don't look well.

20:34.649 --> 20:36.782
I-I don't like flying.

20:36.784 --> 20:39.652
Oh, God, me neither.
It's just gross.

20:41.455 --> 20:43.322
Hey, look, uh...

20:43.324 --> 20:46.292
I was gonna pound half of
this before the flight.

20:46.294 --> 20:49.695
No need to waste it.
You wanna share?

20:49.697 --> 20:52.265
How'd you get that past security?

20:52.267 --> 20:55.301
I lifted it off a duty-free.

20:55.303 --> 20:59.405
Welcome to the Amarillo
International Airport.

20:59.407 --> 21:04.410

Oh, my goodness.
Come to daddy.

21:13.488 --> 21:14.820
Mm.

It's for you.

21:58.765 --> 22:00.666
Boarding group 4.

22:00.668 --> 22:03.402
Only those passengers with
a 4 on their boarding pass

22:03.404 --> 22:05.705
should come to the gate.

22:06.874 --> 22:09.008
Ah! We're going down!

22:09.010 --> 22:10.977
I'm so sorry.
It's my phone.

22:10.979 --> 22:13.779
I'm sorry.
It's Dave.

22:13.781 --> 22:16.349
- Hello.
- Dude, oh, good, I got you.

22:16.351 --> 22:18.317
- Where are you?
- I'm boarding right now.

22:18.319 --> 22:19.852
No! Get off.
I was wrong.

22:19.854 --> 22:21.921
Elizabeth is not in Hawaii.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.724
She's...

22:24.726 --> 22:26.525
- Yeah.
- Your pilot's drunk.

22:26.527 --> 22:28.494
- Don't get on the plane.
- Where am I going?

22:28.496 --> 22:29.729
- She's in Pasadena.
- Pasadena?

22:29.731 --> 22:32.031
You're welcome.

22:38.972 --> 22:42.308
- Morning.
- Morning, honey.

22:42.310 --> 22:45.044
Anything in there
that I need to know?

22:45.046 --> 22:47.947
Once again, not unless
you like politics.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.615
Mm, my favorite.

22:49.617 --> 22:51.751
I don't know how you
read that day after day.

22:51.753 --> 22:53.486
Doesn't it drive you nuts?

22:53.488 --> 22:57.023
If you don't read about what's going
on in this country, Elizabeth,

22:57.025 --> 23:00.359
how can you expect to
be an educated voter?

23:00.361 --> 23:02.995
Vote?
What's that?

23:02.997 --> 23:05.698
Mom, I'm kidding.
God.

23:05.700 --> 23:10.036
I was thinking of going over
and taking in a movie today.

23:10.038 --> 23:12.004
- Care to join me?
- I would love to,

23:12.006 --> 23:14.607
but I have an appointment
with Mrs. Stanton and her kids.

23:14.609 --> 23:15.941
The family you sponsor?

23:15.943 --> 23:17.643
Yeah. They're part of my training.

23:17.645 --> 23:19.779
Three weeks, and then
I'm a full-time social worker.

23:19.781 --> 23:21.380
And I have to go get
ready for work.

23:21.382 --> 23:23.516
What time did they say
buddy was gonna be ready?

23:23.518 --> 23:25.651
- 5:00.
- Thank you.

23:25.653 --> 23:28.654
Turn on rush in the car.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.941
She must be unlisted,
'cause I got nothing.

23:48.943 --> 23:52.044
No, I know, I tried...
I tried everybody.

23:52.046 --> 23:53.913
What would you do...
did you try Becky?

23:53.915 --> 23:56.015
Maybe you should give her a call.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.450
- Oh, Becky?
- Hey.

23:57.452 --> 23:59.685
That chick scares me.

23:59.687 --> 24:01.420
Ah...

24:01.422 --> 24:03.889
Yeah, try Becky and then
get back to me, all right?

24:03.891 --> 24:06.625
- I'll text her.
- Okay.

24:06.627 --> 24:08.894
- Take care, buddy.
- Peace!

24:10.997 --> 24:12.465
- God!
- Don't freak out.

24:12.467 --> 24:15.034
Whoa... whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.503
What the hell you
doing with my girl?

24:17.505 --> 24:19.438
- I wasn't doing anything!
- Shut up!

24:19.440 --> 24:21.607
- J-just don't cut me.
- I said shut up.

24:21.609 --> 24:23.409
Damn it, Eddie,
just leave me alone.

24:23.411 --> 24:26.812
So, uh... How long
this been going on?

24:26.814 --> 24:28.080
There's nothing going on.

24:28.082 --> 24:29.915
He gives me everything you don't.

24:29.917 --> 24:31.617
- What?
- What?

24:31.619 --> 24:33.386
You just don't love me!

24:33.388 --> 24:35.588
So I don't love you, huh?

24:38.158 --> 24:40.493
Then what's this then?

24:40.495 --> 24:43.095
What the hell am I
supposed to do with that?

24:43.097 --> 24:44.764
Fine.

24:44.766 --> 24:46.699
- Choke on it.
- Hey!

24:46.701 --> 24:49.735
Is that how you want her to
remember the big question?

24:49.737 --> 24:53.606
Listen, do you know how long some
people wait their whole lives

24:53.608 --> 24:55.174
to be with the one
person they love,

24:55.176 --> 24:57.543
and you two morons
have found each other,

24:57.545 --> 25:01.881
and you're wasting precious
time acting like children.

25:01.883 --> 25:03.816
Now, she obviously loves you

25:03.818 --> 25:06.452
if she's jumping in a car
with a complete stranger...

25:06.454 --> 25:07.887
Right?

25:07.889 --> 25:10.089
- Right.
- Looking to get your attention.

25:10.091 --> 25:11.791
Now, he obviously loves you

25:11.793 --> 25:14.760
if he's willing to go to
prison for life over you.

25:14.762 --> 25:16.796
Well, it'd probably be 10
to 12 for good behavior.

25:16.798 --> 25:21.066
The point is the two of you
are right here right now,

25:21.068 --> 25:23.002
and you know what you want.

25:23.004 --> 25:24.737
I'm so sorry, baby.

25:24.739 --> 25:28.207
I just get worried
you're gonna leave me.

25:29.743 --> 25:34.547
I love you so much, and I want
you to be my one and only.

25:39.486 --> 25:43.756
Oh, Eddie, I just want
you so bad right now.

25:43.758 --> 25:44.824
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:44.826 --> 25:46.125
Why don't you hop back here

25:46.127 --> 25:48.527
and give me some
of that sweet-smelling sugar.

25:48.529 --> 25:51.897
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna step out.

25:51.899 --> 25:53.999
Daddy's waiting for you, baby.

Yes.

26:44.085 --> 26:45.684
H-hello?

26:45.686 --> 26:46.952
H...

26:46.954 --> 26:48.521
hello?

26:48.523 --> 26:50.956
Damn it.

26:50.958 --> 26:53.125
Yes?

26:53.127 --> 26:55.027
- Mrs. Carter...
- Whatever you're selling,

26:55.029 --> 26:56.095
I'm not buying.

26:56.097 --> 26:58.130
But thank you for trying.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.134
You on the cell
phone, pull over now!

27:07.541 --> 27:10.576
Welcome to California.

27:27.862 --> 27:29.228
Hello.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.163
Hi, Mrs. Carter.
Please don't hang up.

27:31.165 --> 27:32.865
Who is this?
Is this acorn?

27:32.867 --> 27:34.233
No. My name's Mitch Becker.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.135
I'm an old college
friend of Elizabeth's.

27:36.137 --> 27:37.836
I was trying to get
in touch with her.

27:37.838 --> 27:39.138
Uh-huh.
Pecker.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.106
No. Becker, with a "B."

27:41.108 --> 27:42.341
Oh.
Oh, Mitch!

27:42.343 --> 27:44.310
Mitch!
Oh, I'm so sorry.

27:44.312 --> 27:46.278
I was trying to get in
touch with Elizabeth.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.846
I'm in town.
I'd like to see her.

27:47.848 --> 27:49.748
Oh, she'll be so excited
to hear from you.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.717
Oh, my goodness.
Listen, do you have

27:51.719 --> 27:53.819
one of those G.S.P. thingies
in your car?

27:53.821 --> 27:57.022
If you do, you could meet
her at the dog groomer.

27:57.024 --> 27:58.724
She's picking up her dog at 5:00.

27:58.726 --> 28:00.659
That'd be great.
Um...

28:00.661 --> 28:02.127
Well, let me get you
the address then.

28:02.129 --> 28:05.831
Oh, she'll be so
surprised to see you!

28:21.082 --> 28:22.314
- Hi, Lizzie.
- Hey, Sally.

28:22.316 --> 28:24.683
- Is buddy ready?
- You betcha.

28:24.685 --> 28:26.218
I'll go get him.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.654
Thanks.

28:28.656 --> 28:31.156
Knock it off!

28:31.158 --> 28:33.892
Shut up!

28:33.894 --> 28:36.862
Hey, I said quiet!

28:40.400 --> 28:42.735
Go see mommy.
There she is!

28:42.737 --> 28:44.269
How are you?
How do you feel, boy?

28:44.271 --> 28:46.071
- He did great, as always.
- Oh, thanks.

28:46.073 --> 28:48.273
You wanna go on a run later?

28:50.377 --> 28:53.078
- Okay!
- How's the training going?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.813
Good. I'm almost done.

28:54.815 --> 28:57.049
Sounds crazy back there.
How are you?

28:57.051 --> 28:59.818
Uh, honestly, I'm thinking cats.

28:59.820 --> 29:01.854
Buddy, no!

29:04.391 --> 29:07.393
Ohh!
God!

29:07.395 --> 29:09.395
Oh, my gosh!
Buddy, stay!

29:09.397 --> 29:11.263
Bad dog!
Sir, are you okay?

29:11.265 --> 29:13.265
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

29:13.267 --> 29:15.134
Are you all right?

29:15.136 --> 29:17.302
Oh, my God, I feel so bad.

29:19.906 --> 29:21.740
Elizabeth.

29:21.742 --> 29:24.009
Mitch?

29:30.051 --> 29:31.750
Back soon, mom.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.085
Welcome home, buddy.

29:37.090 --> 29:39.091
Pink toenail Polish.

29:39.093 --> 29:41.827
I got beaten up.

29:43.130 --> 29:44.863
- I'm speechless!
- No.

29:44.865 --> 29:48.367
- It's really you.
- It's really me.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.002
You look great.

29:50.004 --> 29:52.438
I was just about to say
the same thing about you.

29:52.440 --> 29:55.474
So what are you doing here?

29:57.744 --> 30:01.246
You look like you need
to tell me something.

30:02.949 --> 30:05.250
Are you sick?
You're not sick, are you?

30:05.252 --> 30:08.020
No. No, no.
Uh...

30:08.022 --> 30:09.288
What about you?

30:09.290 --> 30:11.223
Last I heard, you were married.

30:11.225 --> 30:13.892
Hmm. Uh, no, not yet.

30:13.894 --> 30:16.929
I was going to, and
that didn't happen.

30:16.931 --> 30:18.897
It wasn't, um...

30:18.899 --> 30:20.966
Really my choice.

30:20.968 --> 30:22.201
What about you?

30:22.203 --> 30:24.002
- Me.
- Mm-hmm.

30:24.004 --> 30:26.405
Married?

30:26.407 --> 30:29.007
I would have thought
you'd be married by now.

30:29.009 --> 30:31.009
Funny you should say that.

30:31.011 --> 30:34.146
- Why?
- It's...

30:34.148 --> 30:38.250
It's funny because I...

30:38.252 --> 30:41.220
I, um...

30:41.222 --> 30:46.225
Have to go to the bathroom,
and I will be right back.

30:46.227 --> 30:49.027
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

30:56.035 --> 30:57.970
Oh, come on, Mitch.

30:57.972 --> 30:59.338
Get it together, man!

30:59.340 --> 31:01.006
You've been waiting on this.

31:01.008 --> 31:03.509
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be good.

31:03.511 --> 31:05.110
You got this.
You got this.

31:05.112 --> 31:07.980
Really. 'Cause now you're
talking to your penis.

31:07.982 --> 31:10.382
That's fantastic.

31:14.087 --> 31:16.021
Great.

31:18.291 --> 31:20.225
Elizabeth...

31:20.227 --> 31:22.094
We made a promise to each other

31:22.096 --> 31:23.395
ten years ago.

31:23.397 --> 31:25.097
I'm here to honor that promise.

31:25.099 --> 31:28.233
I'm here to say to you,
"will you marry me?"

31:28.235 --> 31:30.936
I'm sorry.

31:30.938 --> 31:33.472
Good luck, bro.

31:49.423 --> 31:50.989
Jake, remember how I told you about

31:50.991 --> 31:52.825
my college best
friend who was a guy,

31:52.827 --> 31:56.862
and you said that it was impossible
for guys and girls to be friends,

31:56.864 --> 31:58.564
'cause the guy always wants
to get in the girl's pants?

31:58.566 --> 32:00.432
Well, no, babe, what I
actually said was only guys

32:00.434 --> 32:03.001
who are friends with
attractive women can't be.

32:03.003 --> 32:06.238
Jake Jones, meet my college
best friend Mitch Becker.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.874
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

32:08.876 --> 32:10.876
Oh, wait a minute.
I do remember!

32:10.878 --> 32:12.878
Yeah, from some of the college
photos that you showed me.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.146
- Yes!
- I didn't recognize you

32:14.148 --> 32:15.881
without that perm.

32:15.883 --> 32:17.282
Ha ha ha.

32:17.284 --> 32:19.017
Knock it off.

32:19.019 --> 32:20.953
I'm just messing around.
Friend?

32:20.955 --> 32:23.422
- Friends.
- Good. That's better.

32:23.424 --> 32:29.228
Because I could not have you come
to my wedding hating my fiance.

32:29.230 --> 32:30.996
Huh?

32:30.998 --> 32:33.866
Jake and I are getting married.

32:35.034 --> 32:36.401
Really?

32:36.403 --> 32:39.404
Congratulations.

32:39.406 --> 32:40.906
When?

32:40.908 --> 32:42.441
Ten days.

32:42.443 --> 32:45.544
That's fantastic!

32:45.546 --> 32:48.013
You should stay for the wedding!

32:48.015 --> 32:49.548
Would you?

32:51.084 --> 32:54.920
Well, while he contemplates that,
I'll go ahead and pay the check.

32:54.922 --> 32:57.456
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

33:04.364 --> 33:07.366
Just tell him I'll be there in a sec.
I'm on my way, okay?

33:07.368 --> 33:08.901
God!

33:08.903 --> 33:10.936
Oh, wait a minute.
I have something for you.

33:10.938 --> 33:12.905
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:12.907 --> 33:16.074
- Here you go.
- No!

33:16.076 --> 33:18.110
Babe, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

33:18.112 --> 33:20.512
Wait a minute.
I just gave you a wedding ring.

33:20.514 --> 33:22.614
I need a little something
extra than that.

33:22.616 --> 33:24.216
- Mmm.
- Mm. Thank you.

33:24.218 --> 33:26.318
She didn't think I could
get the ring resized

33:26.320 --> 33:28.921
- in time for the wedding.
- I didn't say that.

33:28.923 --> 33:30.689
But I did, and she was wrong.

33:30.691 --> 33:32.925
- Like she always is.
- Okay, don't listen to him.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.326
- I am not always wrong.
- Oh, really?

33:34.328 --> 33:36.161
What about the Christmas party
last year... remember?

33:36.163 --> 33:38.030
You're gonna bring up
the Christmas party?

33:38.032 --> 33:39.631
Yeah, I'm... you gotta
hear this, rich.

33:39.633 --> 33:41.266
- This is hysterical.
- Mitch.

33:41.268 --> 33:44.303
We're at this lame Christmas party last
year, something for her mom's whatever.

33:44.305 --> 33:46.004
- Nice.
- They finally break out

33:46.006 --> 33:47.572
this karaoke machine,
so I start doing

33:47.574 --> 33:49.975
a couple of LL Cool J songs.
It was hilarious.

33:49.977 --> 33:52.077
- Seriously.
- Honestly, it was awful.

33:52.079 --> 33:53.612
It was awesome.
Are you kidding?

33:53.614 --> 33:55.213
The early stuff.
Not the later crap.

33:55.215 --> 33:58.517
Anyway, so we get ready to
leave at the end of the night

33:58.519 --> 34:00.185
and then Elizabeth
here starts dousing

34:00.187 --> 34:02.220
her Debbie downer spray
all over the place,

34:02.222 --> 34:04.523
getting on my case about
drinking too much,

34:04.525 --> 34:06.425
having too much fun,
we gotta call a cab.

34:06.427 --> 34:08.025
So did you?

34:08.027 --> 34:10.562
No, I didn't call a cab.
She called a cab.

34:10.563 --> 34:13.065
- But I was fine to drive.
- No, you weren't.

34:13.067 --> 34:14.699
- That's why I called the cab.
- Point is

34:14.702 --> 34:17.135
is that she was wrong.
She was wrong about that.

34:17.137 --> 34:19.137
She's wrong about this thing.
She's wrong a lot of the time.

34:19.139 --> 34:20.672
I think we get it, okay?

34:20.674 --> 34:23.475
- I think it's cute, though.
- Hey, okay. Um...

34:23.476 --> 34:25.978
How about where I could
get a hotel around here.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.045
No. You'll just stay
with me and my mom.

34:28.047 --> 34:30.549
Whoa, whoa, we got a
big week ahead of us.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.551
We got the wedding.
We got the race.

34:32.553 --> 34:34.119
- What race?
- Jake and I have been training

34:34.121 --> 34:37.022
for this couples marathon
for like six months.

34:37.024 --> 34:38.657
- Couples marathon.
- Yeah.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.726
It's a pretty big deal.

34:40.728 --> 34:42.728
They only let like 12
couples even do it.

34:42.730 --> 34:44.730
You should come with us tomorrow.

34:44.732 --> 34:46.398
What, you want him to
go to the race too?

34:46.400 --> 34:48.300
Yeah, fine, why don't you
come to the bridal shower

34:48.302 --> 34:50.502
- while you're at it?
- Well, I don't want to impose.

34:50.504 --> 34:53.705
You're not imposing, and I'm
not gonna take no for an answer.

34:53.706 --> 34:55.474
We have the perfect guest room.

34:55.476 --> 34:57.509
Okay.

34:57.511 --> 34:59.044
And you'll stay for the wedding?

34:59.046 --> 35:02.681
- Sure.
- It's gonna be just like old times!

35:02.683 --> 35:05.751
- Just like old times.
- Sweetheart, we really gotta get going.

35:05.753 --> 35:07.319
I have to go see Jake's dad
for a couple of things

35:07.321 --> 35:09.488
for the wedding, but I'll
see you at the house.

35:09.490 --> 35:10.789
Do you remember how to get there?

35:10.791 --> 35:12.424
Yeah, yeah.
It's in the GPS.

35:12.426 --> 35:15.427
- Okay. See you.
- Later, rich.

35:15.429 --> 35:17.696
It's Mitch.

35:32.779 --> 35:35.147
Turn left.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.756
In one mile, turn left.

35:47.126 --> 35:49.694
You have arrived at
your destination.

36:04.078 --> 36:07.179
- Yello.
- Yeah, hey, it's me.

36:07.181 --> 36:09.681
- Oh, hey!
- Yeah, good job, Nostradamus.

36:09.683 --> 36:12.617
She's getting married in ten days.

36:12.619 --> 36:14.152
All right, that's great!

36:14.154 --> 36:15.487
No, not to me.

36:15.489 --> 36:16.721
Oh...

36:16.723 --> 36:17.823
I did not predict that.

36:17.825 --> 36:19.291
Yeah. I got a prediction.

36:19.293 --> 36:21.626
When I get home, I'm gonna...

36:27.133 --> 36:29.401
- Hi.
- Hi, Joyce, how are you?

36:29.403 --> 36:31.136
- Good to see you.
- You too.

36:31.138 --> 36:33.705
Could you please tell my
father I'm here to see him?

36:33.707 --> 36:36.441
- Sure.
- Thanks.

36:36.443 --> 36:39.144
Sir, your son is here.

36:39.146 --> 36:42.147
No, he's with Elizabeth.

36:42.149 --> 36:44.749
Oh, okay.

36:44.751 --> 36:46.485
You can go in.
Thanks.

36:46.487 --> 36:48.153
- Thanks.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

36:48.155 --> 36:50.856
He just said Jake, Elizabeth.

36:50.858 --> 36:54.226
Ah. It's okay.
Just go.

36:55.428 --> 36:57.262
Damn it.

37:01.767 --> 37:04.136
Didn't I tell you to come alone?

37:04.138 --> 37:05.804
She was with me.
What could I do?

37:05.806 --> 37:08.273
You drop her off at
home on the way.

37:08.275 --> 37:09.908
Have a seat.

37:12.812 --> 37:15.247
What do you want, dad?

37:15.249 --> 37:18.550
Big Chinese exporter's thinking
about hiring this firm.

37:18.552 --> 37:21.319
That's great, but what does
that have to do with me?

37:21.321 --> 37:24.189
It always has something
to do with you.

37:24.191 --> 37:26.424
Don't you wanna run
this firm one day?

37:26.426 --> 37:29.194
Are you thinking about letting
me handle the account?

37:29.196 --> 37:32.164
No. What, do you think I'm crazy?

37:32.166 --> 37:34.666
Then why am I here, dad?

37:34.668 --> 37:36.468
Um...
You and, uh,

37:36.470 --> 37:37.769
you and her doing okay?

37:37.771 --> 37:39.237
I mean, the wedding's still on?

37:39.239 --> 37:41.273
Well, if by her you mean Elizabeth,

37:41.275 --> 37:44.376
then the answer's yes,
the wedding's still on.

37:44.378 --> 37:46.545
She sign the prenup?

37:46.547 --> 37:48.313
So that's it?

37:48.315 --> 37:50.782
Good old dad looking out
for the family interests?

37:50.784 --> 37:52.484
And forget about love,

37:52.486 --> 37:54.753
but let's just make sure
the money's safe, right?

37:54.755 --> 37:56.288
Did she sign the prenup?

37:56.290 --> 37:59.291
Yeah.
Yeah, she signed it.

37:59.293 --> 38:00.926
Two days ago.

38:00.928 --> 38:03.795
Well, that's good, son.
That's good.

38:03.797 --> 38:05.463
I can't afford any...

38:05.465 --> 38:07.499
I mean, we can't
afford any problems,

38:07.501 --> 38:08.900
any surprises.

38:08.902 --> 38:11.203
The Chinese believe
that a good home life

38:11.205 --> 38:13.505
is essential to a good work life,

38:13.507 --> 38:16.441
and their vetting process
is extremely thorough.

38:16.443 --> 38:19.644
Any shenanigans could
blow this whole deal,

38:19.646 --> 38:22.280
and we're talking big dollars.

38:22.282 --> 38:24.783
I would appreciate it if you didn't

38:24.785 --> 38:27.485
embarrass your family or this firm.

38:27.487 --> 38:28.753
Not to worry, dad.

38:28.755 --> 38:32.457
I'll do my best not
to embarrass you.

38:32.459 --> 38:38.263
Good. Now that we're on the
same page, you can go.

38:44.737 --> 38:47.572
- Is this it right here?
- Yeah, this is it.

38:47.574 --> 38:50.008
Oh, buddy, get down!

38:50.010 --> 38:51.743
Oh, that's okay,
Mrs. Carter.

38:51.745 --> 38:53.545
I'm a dog person.

38:53.547 --> 38:54.746
Good news for you, buddy.

38:54.748 --> 38:56.514
Look,

38:56.516 --> 38:57.749
I call you Mitch.

38:57.751 --> 38:59.618
Why don't you just call me Donna?

38:59.620 --> 39:01.419
- Okay. Thank you, Donna.
- You're welcome.

39:01.421 --> 39:03.788
You're welcome. If you need
anything, ask buddy.

39:04.791 --> 39:06.424
- Okay.
- All right?

39:06.426 --> 39:10.562
- I'll be right downstairs.
- Thank you.

39:10.564 --> 39:12.430
Hi.

39:12.432 --> 39:13.999
Now what, huh?

39:22.041 --> 39:26.778
You're not gonna say anything about
what just happened in there?

39:28.581 --> 39:30.482
You know, I think it's
really ridiculous

39:30.484 --> 39:33.385
that you got this guy
staying at your place.

39:33.387 --> 39:34.819
Who, Mitch?

39:34.821 --> 39:36.655
What's wrong with Mitch?

39:36.657 --> 39:38.990
Elizabeth, it's ten days
before our wedding.

39:38.992 --> 39:41.326
Now, all of a sudden,
you have some ex-boyfriend...

39:41.328 --> 39:42.994
- he's not my ex-boyfriend.
- That's right.

39:42.996 --> 39:44.462
He's your best friend.

39:44.464 --> 39:46.531
And ten days before our wedding,

39:46.533 --> 39:48.033
he decides to shack up
with you at your place?

39:48.035 --> 39:49.634
- Oh, come on.
- Actually, it's not

39:49.636 --> 39:50.769
even your place, though, is it?

39:50.771 --> 39:52.604
It's my place.

39:52.606 --> 39:54.039
I...

39:54.041 --> 39:57.442
I can't believe you would
throw that in my face.

39:57.444 --> 39:59.010
You knew my mom and I's situation.

39:59.012 --> 40:02.314
You're the one that came up with
the idea for us to live there.

40:02.316 --> 40:04.416
I don't know what your dad
said to you up there,

40:04.418 --> 40:07.752
but please stop taking
it out on me, okay?

40:07.754 --> 40:09.721
You gonna sign the prenup?

40:09.723 --> 40:11.756
What?

40:11.758 --> 40:13.458
Are you gonna sign the prenup?

40:13.460 --> 40:15.960
Jake, I haven't even
really had a chance to read...

40:15.962 --> 40:18.363
Elizabeth, I really
need you to sign that.

40:18.365 --> 40:20.365
Well, I've had a lot on
my mind with the race

40:20.367 --> 40:21.900
and the wedding.
I'm working...

40:21.902 --> 40:23.401
Really? You've had
a lot on your mind?

40:23.403 --> 40:25.036
I've had a lot on my mind too.

40:25.038 --> 40:26.938
I've had the race on my mind,
the wedding on my mind.

40:26.940 --> 40:30.475
I have this prenup on my mind that you
seem to never want to talk about.

40:30.477 --> 40:32.344
Now guess what...
now I have Mitch on my mind.

40:32.346 --> 40:33.578
Thanks for that.
Some dweeb I don't even know

40:33.580 --> 40:38.516
who's staying with my-soon-to-be
wife in the house that I paid for.

40:38.518 --> 40:40.952
I really don't want to talk to
you about this right now, okay?

40:40.954 --> 40:43.521
Can you please just take me home?

40:43.523 --> 40:44.622
Fine.

40:47.860 --> 40:51.096
I'm sorry.
I love you.

40:53.399 --> 40:54.999
Love you too.

40:57.670 --> 40:59.571
Welcome back.

40:59.573 --> 41:03.408
Okay, now there has been a lot
of talk about voter fraud,

41:03.410 --> 41:06.378
- and we are here to discuss...
- Hey, Donna?

41:06.380 --> 41:08.046
- Hey.
- Yeah, I was gonna

41:08.048 --> 41:09.914
go grab a beer.
Is anyplace close by?

41:09.916 --> 41:11.950
Oh. Up the street, there's lucky's.

41:11.952 --> 41:13.985
Perfect. Can you tell
Elizabeth where I am?

41:13.987 --> 41:16.521
Of course. I think buddy
and I can handle that.

41:16.523 --> 41:17.655
Right, buddy?

41:17.657 --> 41:20.925
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

41:23.062 --> 41:24.696
Ooh!

41:24.698 --> 41:26.664
- Ah-oh!
- Hey, groin shots

41:26.666 --> 41:27.932
are off-limits.

41:27.934 --> 41:30.402
Anything else is fair game.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.636
Hi.

41:31.638 --> 41:32.937
Hey. What can I get you?

41:32.939 --> 41:35.106
I'll just have a beer, please.

41:35.108 --> 41:36.574
Sure.

41:41.013 --> 41:43.415
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.183
Would you like to start a tab?

41:45.185 --> 41:47.619
- Sure.
- Aah!

41:47.621 --> 41:48.887
What is that?

41:48.889 --> 41:51.456
It's called the whipping post.

41:51.458 --> 41:53.024
I'll have a beer too.

41:53.026 --> 41:55.460
- Put it on this guy's tab.
- Oh!

41:55.462 --> 41:57.729
Where's Elizabeth?

41:57.731 --> 41:58.963
- I dropped her home.
- Ah.

41:58.965 --> 42:00.999
What are you doing here?

42:01.001 --> 42:03.067
Don't you have a big race tomorrow?

42:03.069 --> 42:05.136
What are you doing here?

42:05.138 --> 42:07.038
I'm just having a beer.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.074
<i>No. What are you doing here?</i>

42:12.978 --> 42:17.215
Why would anybody do
that to themselves?

42:17.217 --> 42:21.486
I knew you were a wussy
from the moment I met you.

42:21.488 --> 42:23.521
I'm not a wussy.
I'm just not stupid.

42:23.523 --> 42:24.756
Oh, yeah?

42:24.758 --> 42:25.924
Prove it.

42:25.926 --> 42:27.025
No.

42:27.027 --> 42:28.927
See? Wussy.

42:28.929 --> 42:32.864
You actually challenging me
to a rat tail competition?

42:32.866 --> 42:34.232
Tell you what.

42:34.234 --> 42:38.536
Bet 1,000 to your 100
you tap out first.

42:38.538 --> 42:42.073
Hey, everybody.
Jake just bet $1,000 to...

42:42.075 --> 42:43.875
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Bitch.

42:43.877 --> 42:45.977
- Mitch.
- To Mitch that he can

42:45.979 --> 42:47.946
take him in the whipping post!

42:49.649 --> 42:52.183
Whipping post, whipping post!

42:52.185 --> 42:55.153
Whipping post, whipping post,

42:55.155 --> 42:58.189
whipping post, whipping post,

42:58.191 --> 43:00.091
- whipping...
- Let's do this.

43:00.093 --> 43:03.261
Whipping post, whipping post!

43:03.263 --> 43:04.796
Whoo!

43:04.798 --> 43:06.130
Let's do it!

43:06.132 --> 43:08.600
Okay, mates, here are the rules.

43:08.602 --> 43:11.736
Trade off whips with your
towels until someone taps out.

43:11.738 --> 43:13.571
You tap out, you lose.

43:13.573 --> 43:17.208
No head or groin shots.
Everything else is fair game.

43:17.210 --> 43:19.244
If after five whips
there's still no winner,

43:19.246 --> 43:22.614
we dunk those towels
in ice water, boys.

43:22.616 --> 43:24.015
Understand?

43:24.017 --> 43:25.984
- Yeah, I understand...
- Yeah, okay.

43:25.986 --> 43:27.952
Let's whip it out, boys.

43:32.658 --> 43:35.593
So, uh, you know, how
does this get going here?

43:35.595 --> 43:36.995
Are these regulation towels?

43:36.997 --> 43:38.763
- Oh!
- Ooh!

43:38.765 --> 43:40.265
See that, see that?

43:40.267 --> 43:42.000
Kick his ass, Nate!

43:42.002 --> 43:44.302
- Come on.
- See what you got.

43:44.304 --> 43:47.272
Ow!

43:47.274 --> 43:49.574
Seems kinda dumb.

43:52.846 --> 43:54.579
Ah!

43:54.581 --> 43:57.749
- Wanna tap out?
- I'm good.

43:57.751 --> 44:00.685
- Okay. Okay.
- Sure you wanna do this,

44:00.687 --> 44:02.587
college friend?

44:02.589 --> 44:04.989
- Ow! God!
- Right in the nipple.

44:04.991 --> 44:07.258
That's a good shot.
Good shot.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.960
Need a break in this, or what?

44:08.962 --> 44:10.161
No, we keep going.

44:10.163 --> 44:12.230
- Oh.
- Whoo!

44:15.235 --> 44:16.234
Man, what...

44:16.236 --> 44:17.702
- oh, God!
- Oh!

44:17.704 --> 44:19.637
That was right there!
That was...

44:19.639 --> 44:21.306
Sorry. I don't know.
I've never done it before.

44:21.308 --> 44:23.207
- Keep your whips up.
- All right, I'll keep it up.

44:23.209 --> 44:25.643
- Get this guy?
- We keeping score or...

44:25.645 --> 44:27.679
- Ooh!
- That was a little high.

44:27.681 --> 44:29.647
- No, I know, it's...
- Let's keep it down.

44:29.649 --> 44:31.049
You want out?
You good?

44:31.051 --> 44:32.350
You w... ow!
Son of a...

44:40.225 --> 44:42.627
You felt that one, didn't ya?

44:43.897 --> 44:46.631
Ow! He's hitting the same spot!

44:46.633 --> 44:48.933
Come on! Can't he
move it around a little bit?

44:48.935 --> 44:50.068
- You all right?
- Yeah!

44:50.070 --> 44:52.236
One-trick pony?

44:54.373 --> 44:55.740
Oh, what were the rules again?

44:55.742 --> 44:58.743
Mm!

45:20.967 --> 45:21.467
Aah!

45:26.805 --> 45:30.408
These two idiots have actually
made it to the wet whip.

45:30.410 --> 45:32.677
It is now time for these two fools

45:32.679 --> 45:34.379
to whip each other
at the same time.

45:38.118 --> 45:40.718
Just bow out, man.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.320
That's not gonna happen.
You bow out.

45:42.322 --> 45:44.656
Let's go.
Come on.

45:50.396 --> 45:53.031
Okay, let's whip it out, boys.

45:53.033 --> 45:55.133
Let's whip it out.

45:56.903 --> 45:57.969
Hey!

45:57.971 --> 45:59.370
Are you both crazy?

45:59.372 --> 46:01.272
That's it.
Show's over.

46:01.274 --> 46:03.808
- Boo!
- Come on!

46:03.810 --> 46:05.410
What were you both thinking?

46:05.412 --> 46:08.046
Talk about this tomorrow?

46:08.048 --> 46:10.114
I'm good with that.

46:10.116 --> 46:11.449
I'm taking Mitch home.

46:11.451 --> 46:13.384
And I'm gonna see you
at 10:00 A.M.

46:13.386 --> 46:15.753
What is that, your mom?
Ha ha ha!

46:15.755 --> 46:19.223
- Come on!
- You had him, Jake.

46:21.860 --> 46:23.161
Thanks.

46:23.163 --> 46:25.430
Somebody should tend
to those wounds,

46:25.432 --> 46:28.399
but you're definitely
too drunk to drive.

46:29.468 --> 46:31.803
You got any suggestions?

46:31.805 --> 46:33.304
I live right upstairs.

46:33.306 --> 46:35.406
<i>♪ Tell me what the hell ♪</i>

46:35.408 --> 46:38.276
<i>♪ are you thinking of ♪</i>

46:38.278 --> 46:39.444
<i>♪ when you say ♪</i>

46:39.446 --> 46:41.446

46:41.448 --> 46:43.181
<i>♪ everything you want ♪</i>

46:43.183 --> 46:44.415
Ah...

46:44.417 --> 46:47.118
Ohh...
Oh!

46:47.120 --> 46:49.320
Gah!
Ah!

46:52.291 --> 46:54.158
What the hell were you thinking?

46:54.160 --> 46:55.760
Do you need some help?

46:55.762 --> 46:58.796
If you've come to yell at me, I think
I'm suffering enough as it is.

46:58.798 --> 47:01.132
I'm not gonna yell at you.

47:01.134 --> 47:03.167
- Here.
- What the hell

47:03.169 --> 47:04.936
- were you thinking?
- Oh, my gosh.

47:04.938 --> 47:06.938
Oh...

47:06.940 --> 47:08.005
- Ah!
- I'm sorry.

47:08.007 --> 47:09.307
Ow...

47:09.309 --> 47:11.175
Oh, my gosh!

47:11.177 --> 47:13.044
Where did you find this?

47:13.046 --> 47:15.012
Oh. Friggin' Dave.

47:15.014 --> 47:18.783
He was busting my balls
about that, so...

47:18.785 --> 47:20.785
You ate so many hot dogs that day.

47:20.787 --> 47:23.955
27. I remember every one of them.

47:23.957 --> 47:25.289
I ate a lot too.

47:25.291 --> 47:27.825
If memory serves, you had three.

47:27.827 --> 47:29.360
- Three is a lot.
- Three's a lot?

47:29.362 --> 47:31.329
Yes. I mean, not as many
as 27, but...

47:31.331 --> 47:35.066
Well, no, yeah, look at my face,
and, you know, look at yours.

47:35.068 --> 47:37.502
We're babies.

47:37.504 --> 47:39.070
Okay. I'm off to bed.

47:39.072 --> 47:41.806
Good night.

47:41.808 --> 47:44.008
Good night.

47:49.348 --> 47:52.183
Hey.
Don't you judge me.

47:55.822 --> 47:57.555
You wanna sleep together?

48:00.292 --> 48:01.893
- College.
- College.

48:09.234 --> 48:12.904
Come on, open!

48:20.913 --> 48:22.580
Hi.

48:24.082 --> 48:25.850
Hi.

48:25.852 --> 48:27.185
I can't get my door open.

48:27.187 --> 48:29.120
You think you could help me out?

48:29.122 --> 48:31.322
Your door...

48:34.293 --> 48:36.394
Oh, that's nice.

48:36.396 --> 48:39.964
- Yeah, it's stuck.
- Um...

48:39.966 --> 48:41.999
Your door's stuck.
Yeah, let me, uh,

48:42.001 --> 48:43.100
let me take a look.

48:45.871 --> 48:48.906
All runners should be making
your way to registration now.

48:51.110 --> 48:52.944
He said 10:00 A.M.

48:52.946 --> 48:54.278
Right?

48:54.280 --> 48:55.980
Yeah.

48:55.982 --> 48:57.882
Maybe he got held up.

48:57.884 --> 49:00.251
I don't know, but I can't
wait for him anymore.

49:00.253 --> 49:01.552
I'm gonna go register, okay?

49:01.554 --> 49:04.622
We'll be right here, honey.

49:06.124 --> 49:08.259
Donna, what's the
deal with this guy?

49:08.261 --> 49:10.161
I don't know.

49:10.163 --> 49:13.598
Oh, Mitch, I don't know.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.133
Speak of the devil...

49:18.404 --> 49:19.937
Hey!

49:19.939 --> 49:22.173
Hey, where have you been?

49:22.175 --> 49:25.076
And what... why aren't you
dressed for the race?

49:25.078 --> 49:27.044
What... what?

49:27.046 --> 49:28.512
Oh, my God!

49:28.514 --> 49:31.482
- Are you drunk?
- No, I'm not drunk.

49:31.484 --> 49:34.385
I was drunk.
I'm just hung over now.

49:34.387 --> 49:36.220
Mitch, could you grab his stuff?

49:36.222 --> 49:38.122
Hey, don't... don't...
don't touch my stuff, bro.

49:38.124 --> 49:39.457
All right?

49:39.459 --> 49:42.260
If she sees you like
this, it will kill her.

49:42.262 --> 49:43.961
Relax, Donna.

49:43.963 --> 49:45.563
Give me a break.
Where is she?

49:45.565 --> 49:47.064
She's at registration.

49:47.066 --> 49:48.399
Hey, I wasn't talking
to you, dirt bag!

49:48.401 --> 49:51.569
You know, we could finish what we
started last night if you want.

49:51.571 --> 49:53.371
All right, let's go, 12-step.

49:53.373 --> 49:55.172
Oh, great.

49:55.174 --> 49:58.342
That's what I thought.

49:58.344 --> 50:00.111
Let's do this thing.

50:00.113 --> 50:01.379
- Ow! Ow!
- Nate...

50:03.249 --> 50:05.082
Get away from me!

50:05.084 --> 50:06.284
Ah... Uh...

50:06.286 --> 50:07.618
I'll go find a doctor.

50:07.620 --> 50:09.921
- What happened?
- You do that!

50:09.923 --> 50:13.124
Whatever happens, do not tell
Elizabeth you've been drinking.

50:13.126 --> 50:15.493
Just quit yelling at me!
God, I have a headache!

50:15.495 --> 50:18.262
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

50:18.264 --> 50:19.630
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:19.632 --> 50:22.333
- Team name.
- Welcome back, Carter.

50:22.335 --> 50:23.467
Okay.

50:23.469 --> 50:24.635
Here you go.
These are for you.

50:24.637 --> 50:26.003
- Thanks.
- I'll see you

50:26.005 --> 50:27.672
- at the starting line.
- Okay.

50:27.674 --> 50:30.207
Next.
Team name.

50:30.209 --> 50:34.045
I'm not gonna be too sure
until I look at some x-rays.

50:34.047 --> 50:37.381
But what I see so far looks
like a high ankle sprain.

50:37.383 --> 50:39.150
Ow! Ow!

50:39.152 --> 50:41.585
Oh, no, what happened?

50:44.022 --> 50:45.690
Speak.

50:45.692 --> 50:47.491
I-it was a freak accident, babe.

50:47.493 --> 50:50.094
I stepped out of the car
and I rolled my ankle.

50:50.096 --> 50:51.963
Is that the truth?

50:53.298 --> 50:54.532
Mitch.

50:54.534 --> 50:58.302
It's pretty much what I saw.

50:59.738 --> 51:01.405
Do you think there's
any possibility

51:01.407 --> 51:03.107
- of him running today?
- Babe, he's a doctor.

51:03.109 --> 51:04.709
- I can't run.
- Like I say,

51:04.711 --> 51:06.277
I gotta look at some x-rays.

51:06.279 --> 51:07.578
So that's it?

51:07.580 --> 51:10.047
What about Mrs. Stanton
and her kids?

51:10.049 --> 51:11.582
I think the pledges
will understand.

51:11.584 --> 51:13.317
Final call for registration.

51:13.319 --> 51:15.453
I don't think so.

51:15.455 --> 51:20.057
Well, we're not gonna find
out, 'cause I'll run.

51:20.059 --> 51:22.293
- What?
- If you'll have me.

51:22.295 --> 51:24.595
I will so have you.

51:25.430 --> 51:27.365
Can you handle Jake?

51:27.367 --> 51:29.033
Mitch and I have a race to run.

51:29.035 --> 51:30.601
Wait, whoa...
wait, wait, wait...

51:30.603 --> 51:32.503
- go get 'em, guys.
- Wait, I...

51:32.505 --> 51:35.206
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

51:36.108 --> 51:37.641
- Ow!
- All couples should be

51:37.643 --> 51:39.443
making their way to
the starting line.

51:39.445 --> 51:41.012
I got it, I got it.

51:43.648 --> 51:45.683
How long is this thing anyway?

51:45.685 --> 51:47.218
Probably best if you don't know.

51:47.220 --> 51:50.321
Just remember, keep an even pace
and remember that you're doing it

51:50.323 --> 51:51.589
for Mrs. Stanton and her kids.

51:51.591 --> 51:53.691
Mrs. Stanton
and her kids. Right.

51:53.693 --> 51:56.293
Okay. This gonna
mess up my pedicure?

51:56.295 --> 51:59.063
The Pasadena couples
marathon is about to begin.

51:59.065 --> 52:01.298
I should have gone to the
bathroom first, right?

52:01.300 --> 52:04.568
Ladies and gentlemen, do
not break your connection,

52:04.570 --> 52:06.170
or you will be disqualified.

52:06.172 --> 52:09.774
Also, make sure you
stay in the course,

52:09.776 --> 52:11.609
especially when you hit trail hill.

52:11.611 --> 52:14.545
- Trail what?
- Shh!

52:14.547 --> 52:16.213
There... there's a hill?

52:16.215 --> 52:19.483
In your position.

52:19.485 --> 52:21.585
On your marks...

52:21.587 --> 52:23.287

52:56.389 --> 52:58.622
Donna, I can do it by
myself, all right?

52:58.624 --> 53:01.158
Oh, shut up.
I'm helping.

53:01.160 --> 53:03.494
I can't believe she's running
that race with Mitch.

53:03.496 --> 53:05.663
I bet they don't even finish.

53:05.665 --> 53:07.098
Oh, ho!
She will.

53:07.100 --> 53:09.800
I just hope Mitch survives.

So he just stepped in, huh?

53:54.180 --> 53:56.580
I know.
Crazy, right?

53:56.582 --> 53:59.583
Yeah. Well, we have
checkpoints all over this place.

53:59.585 --> 54:02.753
If they were to have quit, we
would have found out by now.

54:06.491 --> 54:08.392
Come on, baby!

54:08.394 --> 54:09.727
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

54:09.729 --> 54:11.262
Come on, baby!

54:11.264 --> 54:13.931
- Oh, wow.
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.

54:13.933 --> 54:16.267
Are you all right?
Are you all right?

54:16.269 --> 54:17.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

54:17.770 --> 54:20.237
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey, hey.

54:20.239 --> 54:21.639
- You okay?
- Oh, my gosh!

54:21.641 --> 54:24.241
Should we call an ambulance?
Oh!

54:24.243 --> 54:26.210
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

54:26.212 --> 54:27.545
Put your arm around me.
Hold on.

54:27.547 --> 54:30.214
Oh, look at this.
Oh, my God!

54:30.216 --> 54:32.616
- Go, Lizzie!
- You all right?

54:32.618 --> 54:36.253
Mitch!
Here, sweetheart.

54:36.255 --> 54:37.888
Oh, my God.

54:37.890 --> 54:40.391
You okay?
Come on.

54:44.229 --> 54:46.363
As I get closer and
closer to Elizabeth,

54:46.365 --> 54:52.336
I'm beginning to feel more and
more confident about this.

54:52.338 --> 54:54.738
Morning, sunshine.

54:54.740 --> 54:56.807
Good morning, mommy.

54:56.809 --> 54:58.576
Mommy?

54:58.578 --> 55:01.412
- You're not my mom!
- Mm-mm.

55:01.414 --> 55:03.214
Good thing.

55:03.216 --> 55:05.683
Oh.
Oh, God, it hurts to move.

55:05.685 --> 55:07.351
I figured it would.

55:07.353 --> 55:09.820
That way, you can't kick me out.

55:11.390 --> 55:13.724
Doesn't it remind you of
when we were camping?

55:13.726 --> 55:17.228
I could stay here all day.

55:17.230 --> 55:19.530
I don't think I have a choice.

55:23.669 --> 55:26.303
I think I left my credit card
at the bar the other night.

55:26.305 --> 55:27.538
Lizzie!

55:27.540 --> 55:29.306
- Are you up?
- Uh, yeah.

55:29.308 --> 55:32.710
Just got a call from the
wedding photographer.

55:32.712 --> 55:35.879
He needs to change his appointment
to 10:30 A.M. tomorrow.

55:35.881 --> 55:39.350
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome!

55:39.352 --> 55:42.419
I actually forgot I had
that appointment today.

55:45.790 --> 55:48.492
I'm sorry, Liz, I have to ask.

55:48.494 --> 55:50.027
Yes?

55:50.029 --> 55:52.796
Why are you marrying this guy?

55:55.467 --> 55:56.667
Excuse me?

55:56.669 --> 55:58.969
No, I'm just saying, it's...

55:58.971 --> 56:01.705
From what I've seen, you're
not very happy with him.

56:01.707 --> 56:05.376
And if you don't mind me
saying, he's kind of a dick.

56:05.378 --> 56:06.710
Wow.

56:06.712 --> 56:09.280
What, you disagree?

56:09.282 --> 56:11.382
What would you like
for me to do, Mitch?

56:11.384 --> 56:14.485
Do you want me to dump
Jake and marry you?

56:16.622 --> 56:19.623
And who do you think you are, you're
gonna come here after ten years

56:19.625 --> 56:20.824
and you're gonna judge me?

56:20.826 --> 56:22.693
Wait a second.
For... ow.

56:22.695 --> 56:25.729
For your information, I
barely made it through Texas

56:25.731 --> 56:27.064
coming out here to find you.

56:27.066 --> 56:28.832
If I want to judge, I'll judge!

56:28.834 --> 56:30.567
Okay, now we're gonna
play that card?

56:30.569 --> 56:32.670
The "I worked so hard to find you"?

56:32.672 --> 56:33.804
Come on, give me a break.

56:33.806 --> 56:34.972
It's no card.

56:34.974 --> 56:37.808
Fine.
I'll bite.

56:37.810 --> 56:41.045
Laura!

56:41.047 --> 56:44.048
There he is.

56:44.050 --> 56:46.050
- Hey, Rudy...
- Come here, you!

56:46.052 --> 56:47.885
Bring it in.
Bring it in.

56:47.887 --> 56:52.056
So... I heard you're spending
the night at my sister's.

56:52.058 --> 56:54.425
- Uh, yes, sir.
- Did you have sex with her yet?

56:54.427 --> 56:55.626
- Rudy!
- Sorry.

56:55.628 --> 56:57.928
I'm just kidding.
But I heard she's good.

56:57.930 --> 56:59.463
I'm just kidding!

56:59.465 --> 57:01.799
Hey, would you like to
hang out with us a bit?

57:01.801 --> 57:04.002
Me and my boys, we're gonna
be hanging around the fire,

57:04.003 --> 57:06.003
saying a couple chants.

57:06.005 --> 57:08.072
What kinda chants?

57:08.074 --> 57:11.742
Well, number one,
our lord and savior, J.C.

57:11.744 --> 57:12.810
J...

57:12.812 --> 57:14.445
Jesus Christ.

57:14.447 --> 57:16.046
Right.

57:16.048 --> 57:18.415
Can I ask what the bonfire's about?

57:18.417 --> 57:21.819
I mean, don't you guys
usually burn... crosses?

57:21.821 --> 57:23.754
Whoa, whoa.

57:23.756 --> 57:26.557
Who do you think we are?

57:26.559 --> 57:28.092
K.K.K.?

57:28.094 --> 57:30.094
What would make you say that?

57:30.096 --> 57:32.496
It might have something to
do with the white robes.

57:32.498 --> 57:33.964
Laura, first of all,
they're not white...

57:33.966 --> 57:35.666
they're taupe.

57:35.668 --> 57:37.835
You've heard of the hell's angels?

57:37.837 --> 57:39.403
- Of course.
- Well, they are

57:39.405 --> 57:40.804
the heaven's angels.

57:40.806 --> 57:42.673
- Oh...
- We're a small group,

57:42.675 --> 57:44.108
but we're growing fast.

57:44.110 --> 57:46.543
The robes are what they
call angel shrouds.

57:46.545 --> 57:49.847
Yo, Rudy, the boys are getting
restless waiting on you.

57:49.849 --> 57:51.682
How much longer we gotta wait?

57:51.684 --> 57:55.586
Would you like to join us for
our ceremony this evening?

57:55.588 --> 57:57.121
If I refuse?

57:57.123 --> 57:59.523
I'll just have the boys
come over and, uh,

57:59.525 --> 58:02.793
they'll just kick
the snot outta you.

58:02.795 --> 58:04.027
Let's chant!

58:04.029 --> 58:05.662
All right, well, you boys have fun.

58:05.664 --> 58:07.731
- I'm outta here.
- You're going?

58:07.733 --> 58:09.733
Oh, yeah.

58:09.735 --> 58:11.602
- Let's go.
- Okay.

58:11.604 --> 58:15.406
Yeah. A biker gang called the
heaven's angels in Texas?

58:15.408 --> 58:17.074
That's ridiculous.

58:17.076 --> 58:19.176
Rudy turned out to be
a really nice guy.

58:19.178 --> 58:20.878
- He gave me his card.
- You know what?

58:20.880 --> 58:24.815
Jake proposed to me, I said
yes, and we're getting married.

58:24.817 --> 58:26.650
Well, great.
Good. Fine.

58:26.652 --> 58:28.552
Good for you!

58:30.522 --> 58:31.622
You know...

58:31.624 --> 58:33.023
Buddy!

58:33.025 --> 58:35.859
Come on, let's wake Mitch up!

58:35.861 --> 58:37.594
Wait... no, bu... no.

58:37.596 --> 58:38.595
Buddy, n-n...

58:38.597 --> 58:39.763
Aah!

58:46.438 --> 58:48.505
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hey, man.

58:48.507 --> 58:50.541
Sorry. We don't open
for another hour.

58:50.543 --> 58:52.543
Yeah, I know.
I was in here the other night.

58:52.545 --> 58:53.977
I think I left my credit card.

58:53.979 --> 58:56.079
I was...
Playing the, uh,

58:56.081 --> 58:57.881
- whipping post.
- Yes!

58:57.883 --> 58:59.683
I remember you!

58:59.685 --> 59:00.984
You're awesome!

59:00.986 --> 59:02.152
- Thank you.
- Yeah. No, man,

59:02.154 --> 59:04.621
you're one tough son of a bitch!

59:04.623 --> 59:07.191
Thank you.

59:07.193 --> 59:09.593
- Uh, the credit card.
- Oh, you don't just like

59:09.595 --> 59:11.128
staring at each other awkwardly.

59:11.130 --> 59:13.497
- Sorry. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

59:13.499 --> 59:15.566
I'll call you later.

59:21.906 --> 59:23.874
What are you doing here?

59:23.876 --> 59:25.742
Picking up my credit card.

59:25.744 --> 59:27.878
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

59:27.880 --> 59:30.047
Nothin'.

59:30.049 --> 59:32.916
I don't know what you
think you saw here,

59:32.918 --> 59:35.953
but, uh...
You didn't see anything.

59:35.955 --> 59:38.522
Didn't say I did.

59:38.524 --> 59:40.491
Good.

59:44.196 --> 59:46.530
Mr. Mitch Becker...

59:46.532 --> 59:48.532
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

59:48.534 --> 59:52.002
Oh, and on tabs this high,
we automatically add 20%.

59:53.872 --> 59:56.573
- You have a pen?
- Probably.

01:00:06.118 --> 01:00:09.052
I only got a few minutes,
whoever you are.

01:00:09.054 --> 01:00:10.120
I... oh.

01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:12.823
- Hello, Donna.
- Stanley Jones.

01:00:12.825 --> 01:00:14.725
What brings you out here?

01:00:14.727 --> 01:00:16.627
Well, for starters, I was hoping

01:00:16.629 --> 01:00:21.765
that you would fix me one of
your delicious cups of coffee.

01:00:21.767 --> 01:00:23.767
The house looks great.

01:00:23.769 --> 01:00:25.802
Thank you.

01:00:25.804 --> 01:00:27.237
How's Elizabeth?

01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:30.874
I understand that she has an
old friend in town visiting.

01:00:30.876 --> 01:00:33.844
Oh, Mitch. He drove all
the way from Boston to see her.

01:00:33.846 --> 01:00:35.212
She's so excited.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.915
They haven't seen each
other since college.

01:00:37.917 --> 01:00:40.851
How heartwarming.

01:00:40.853 --> 01:00:45.222
You've never been good
at smalltalk, Stan.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.124
Why are you here?

01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:51.194
I just wanna make sure that she's
going forward with this wedding.

01:00:51.196 --> 01:00:53.597
Well, of course she is.

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:55.265
Why would you...

01:00:55.267 --> 01:00:56.833
you don't think...

01:00:56.835 --> 01:00:59.336
Oh, Stan!

01:00:59.338 --> 01:01:01.071
They're just friends.

01:01:01.073 --> 01:01:04.207
Trust me.
You have nothing to worry about.

01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:05.709
You're right, Donna.

01:01:05.711 --> 01:01:07.210
I'm not very good at small talk.

01:01:07.212 --> 01:01:10.314
I want your assurance
that my son's wedding

01:01:10.316 --> 01:01:12.749
is gonna go off without a hitch.

01:01:12.751 --> 01:01:14.952
It would be a shame if I had to...

01:01:14.954 --> 01:01:18.822
Sell certain assets in order
to make up my losses.

01:01:20.124 --> 01:01:22.626
Well, let me be perfectly clear.

01:01:22.628 --> 01:01:27.798
You can be well assured that the
wedding will go on as planned.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.068
Thank you.
I can get the key in,

01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.669
but then when I turn it...
oh!

01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:36.106
Just the new paint
sticking to the door.

01:01:36.108 --> 01:01:38.208
Thank you.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:40.043
Oh, I'm Elizabeth Carter.

01:01:40.045 --> 01:01:41.979
Hi, Elizabeth.

01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:44.147
- And you are...
- Oh.

01:01:44.149 --> 01:01:47.217
I'm bitch maker.
Mitch. Becker.

01:01:47.219 --> 01:01:49.186
Fourth floor.
What the hell?

01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:50.821
- Hey, roomie.
- Hi.

01:01:50.823 --> 01:01:52.823
Mm.

01:01:52.825 --> 01:01:56.693
Uh, well, I'll leave you two alone.

01:01:56.695 --> 01:01:59.129
You know, we should
hang out some time.

01:01:59.131 --> 01:02:00.364
Gr-oss!

01:02:01.966 --> 01:02:03.266
That'd be great.

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.103
- See ya.
- Yeah.

01:02:06.105 --> 01:02:07.971
Bye.

01:02:09.841 --> 01:02:11.708
Bye.

01:02:16.782 --> 01:02:19.316
What happened to you, man?

01:02:19.318 --> 01:02:21.718
Oh, I just fell in love.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.221
I just got high in the quad.

01:02:24.223 --> 01:02:26.256
- College.
- College.

01:02:32.263 --> 01:02:34.965
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

01:02:34.967 --> 01:02:37.034
Somebody had a long
day at work, huh?

01:02:37.036 --> 01:02:39.703
- Yes.
- Care to join me?

01:02:39.705 --> 01:02:41.772
You know I hate drinking alone.

01:02:41.774 --> 01:02:42.973
Sure.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:50.313
Here you go.

01:02:50.315 --> 01:02:52.816
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

01:02:58.322 --> 01:03:01.291
Listen, Elizabeth,
I want to apologize

01:03:01.293 --> 01:03:03.360
- for the way...
- No, Mitch, honestly,

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:05.796
I'm the one that owes the apology.

01:03:05.798 --> 01:03:08.331
After I thought about it,
I can totally understand

01:03:08.333 --> 01:03:09.900
why you felt that way about Jake.

01:03:09.902 --> 01:03:11.334
Listen, I don't even know him...

01:03:11.336 --> 01:03:13.036
no, no, just...

01:03:13.038 --> 01:03:14.371
Let me finish, okay?

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:17.240
This is kind of difficult
for me to say.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:22.312
My parents always thought
that they'd retired here.

01:03:22.314 --> 01:03:27.751
And then my dad died suddenly, and
both of us were really devastated.

01:03:27.753 --> 01:03:29.953
Six months later, I'm
living in Los Angeles

01:03:29.955 --> 01:03:32.122
and I'm about to get married,
and then that didn't happen

01:03:32.124 --> 01:03:35.392
because I found my fiance
in bed with my best friend.

01:03:35.394 --> 01:03:38.328
My life was kinda going nowhere.

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:40.997
I felt like... Felt like
I needed to move home,

01:03:40.999 --> 01:03:42.332
and then once I got here,

01:03:42.334 --> 01:03:45.168
I found out my mom was
about to lose the house.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:49.406
She got caught up in one of
those refinancing schemes,

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:52.943
and she had no choice but
to sell or be foreclosed.

01:03:52.945 --> 01:03:57.080
- Mm. Wow.
- That's when I met Jake.

01:03:57.082 --> 01:03:59.182
He came to look at the house

01:03:59.184 --> 01:04:02.819
and pretty soon realized that
all he could do was look at me.

01:04:02.821 --> 01:04:07.090
I know it sounds really silly, but
after what I had been through,

01:04:07.092 --> 01:04:10.393
it felt really nice.

01:04:10.395 --> 01:04:13.864
We went to dinner.
I explained our situation.

01:04:13.866 --> 01:04:16.066
And shortly after that,
he bought the house

01:04:16.068 --> 01:04:17.968
and said that we could stay.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:19.302
For free?

01:04:19.304 --> 01:04:23.106
His family has a lot of money.

01:04:23.108 --> 01:04:24.508
Ah, I see.
For free

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.877
as long as the two
of you are together.

01:04:26.879 --> 01:04:29.346
It's really not like that.

01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:33.250
He proposed.
I said yes.

01:04:33.252 --> 01:04:35.952
And here we are.

01:04:38.256 --> 01:04:41.458
What can I say about that?

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.795
I guess I don't really
need you to say anything.

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.101
Thank you.

01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:32.509
- Woman...
- Shh.

01:05:32.511 --> 01:05:34.144
- Potter residence.
- Hey, Donna,

01:05:34.146 --> 01:05:37.347
- is Elizabeth there?
- Oh, good morning, Jake.

01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:39.916
I think she's awake... she must be
around here somewhere.

01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:42.886
Let me try and fi...
it's for you.

01:05:42.888 --> 01:05:44.354
Hey, you.

01:05:44.356 --> 01:05:45.989
Hello, sweetheart.
Look, I'm sorry,

01:05:45.991 --> 01:05:47.591
but I'm not gonna be able to make

01:05:47.593 --> 01:05:51.194
that photographer
appointment this morning.

01:05:51.196 --> 01:05:52.429
Uh...

01:05:52.431 --> 01:05:54.497
Is... okay.
Is everything all right?

01:05:54.499 --> 01:05:57.267
No, everything's fine, but
my dad just wants to show me

01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:59.069
this building he's
thinking of purchasing.

01:05:59.071 --> 01:06:01.438
- You mind going on your own?
- I would like for you

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:05.175
to be there, but if you
can't, I can do it by myself.

01:06:05.177 --> 01:06:06.443
That's my girl.

01:06:06.445 --> 01:06:10.046
Okay. I'll see you when I get back.

01:06:11.949 --> 01:06:13.516
What now?

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:15.118
Jake has to go meet his dad,

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.555
so I get to go to the
photographer by myself.

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.957
- Want me to go with you?
- No.

01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:23.260
I'm okay.
Thank you.

01:06:23.262 --> 01:06:24.928
Pretty please?

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:28.231
No. Let me read you
your horoscope instead.

01:06:28.233 --> 01:06:30.934
- Oh, please.
- Leo.

01:06:42.113 --> 01:06:43.313
Good morning.

01:06:43.315 --> 01:06:45.148
Good morning.

01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:46.917
Um...

01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:48.518
I was coming to actually tell you

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.154
that I'm leaving to go meet
with the wedding photographer.

01:06:51.156 --> 01:06:52.656
I'll be back in a
little bit, though.

01:06:52.658 --> 01:06:55.959
That's good, 'cause your mom asked me to
clean some stuff out in the garage, so...

01:06:55.961 --> 01:06:58.395
She did?
That's nice of you.

01:06:58.397 --> 01:07:00.664
- Thank you.
- Oh, not a problem.

01:07:00.666 --> 01:07:03.133
All right, I'll see you later.
Yeah.

01:07:03.135 --> 01:07:05.101
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

01:07:07.638 --> 01:07:09.506
Oh, my God.

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:25.689
Hey, douche bag, you and
me gotta talk, bro.

01:07:25.691 --> 01:07:28.291
What is your problem now?

01:07:28.293 --> 01:07:30.460
What'd you tell her, man?

01:07:30.462 --> 01:07:33.263
I see the ankle healed up nice.
Screw my ankle, all right?

01:07:33.265 --> 01:07:34.531
What did you tell her?

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:37.000
I didn't tell her anything, okay?

01:07:37.002 --> 01:07:38.368
'Cause it would devastate her.

01:07:38.370 --> 01:07:40.570
Give me a break.
You expect me to believe that?

01:07:40.572 --> 01:07:43.039
After what I saw last night?

01:07:43.041 --> 01:07:45.008
Last night?
There was nothing to see.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.477
I saw you!
I was right over there!

01:07:47.479 --> 01:07:49.145
She kissed you!

01:07:49.147 --> 01:07:50.580
And you kissed her back.

01:07:50.582 --> 01:07:52.549
You love her, man!

01:07:52.551 --> 01:07:55.218
You've always loved her.

01:07:56.621 --> 01:07:58.655
Elizabeth made her choice, okay?

01:07:58.657 --> 01:08:01.424
And whether I like it or not,

01:08:01.426 --> 01:08:04.260
I'm not gonna do anything
to screw up her life.

01:08:04.262 --> 01:08:05.695
Well, guess what, jerk off?

01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:07.764
That's exactly what you're doing.

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:10.066
Now, I'm gonna be back in an hour.

01:08:10.068 --> 01:08:12.335
Make up any bogus excuse you want,

01:08:12.337 --> 01:08:14.738
but when I get back, your
bags better be packed

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.741
and you better be
headed back to Boston.

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:20.042
Got it?

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:29.185
Whoa!

01:08:29.187 --> 01:08:31.520
Buddy!

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:32.721
It's okay, buddy.

01:08:32.724 --> 01:08:34.390
- Oh...
- Help me get him in the car.

01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:38.060
- Uh... No. No.
- Where you going?

01:08:38.063 --> 01:08:41.430
Jake, help me get buddy in the car!

01:08:44.136 --> 01:08:46.136
What...

01:08:48.106 --> 01:08:50.707
Okay, buddy.
It's okay, I'm here.

01:08:53.243 --> 01:08:55.278
One, two, three.

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:56.712
Okay, bud.

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:59.149
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

01:08:59.151 --> 01:09:01.350
Donna.

01:09:01.353 --> 01:09:03.819
Donna, get the car!

01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:10.693
Dr. Dana Burke, please
dial extension 202.

01:09:10.694 --> 01:09:13.595
Dr. Burke, please dial
extension 202.

01:09:15.733 --> 01:09:17.332
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

01:09:17.335 --> 01:09:18.835
Honey.

01:09:18.837 --> 01:09:22.138
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Is buddy okay?

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.175
Mitch is back there with
the doctor right now.

01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:27.243
I've called Jake a hundred times.

01:09:27.245 --> 01:09:29.279
He's not answering his phone.

01:09:29.281 --> 01:09:30.412
Mitch!

01:09:30.415 --> 01:09:31.613
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

01:09:31.616 --> 01:09:33.316
Oh, my God, your shirt.

01:09:33.318 --> 01:09:34.551
It's okay, all right?

01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:35.685
The doctors are with him right now.

01:09:35.687 --> 01:09:38.854
He's gonna be out in a second
to let us know what's going on.

01:09:38.857 --> 01:09:41.291
- How is he?
- Well, we were able

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:43.560
to stop the bleeding
and repair the damage

01:09:43.562 --> 01:09:46.328
to the leg and the abdomen.

01:09:46.331 --> 01:09:47.630
Is he gonna be okay?

01:09:47.631 --> 01:09:49.499
It looks very good.

01:09:49.501 --> 01:09:50.834
He'll have a full recovery.

01:09:50.836 --> 01:09:53.536
- Thank you.
- Thank Mitch.

01:09:53.537 --> 01:09:57.173
It was Mitch's quick action
that saved buddy's life.

01:09:57.175 --> 01:09:59.142
Thank you.

01:09:59.144 --> 01:10:01.344
- Can we see him?
- Sure. Just remember,

01:10:01.346 --> 01:10:02.579
he's a little out of it.

01:10:02.581 --> 01:10:04.481
He hasn't been moved
to recovery yet,

01:10:04.483 --> 01:10:07.450
but I'm sure he'd like
to see his mom and dad.

01:10:07.452 --> 01:10:08.885
Oh, Mitch isn't his dad.

01:10:08.887 --> 01:10:11.588
He's a friend visiting in town.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.490
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt you,

01:10:13.492 --> 01:10:15.792
but I have some paperwork
that needs filling out.

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.161
No problem.
You two go.

01:10:18.163 --> 01:10:20.864
- Thank you, mom.
- I'll take care of this.

01:10:20.866 --> 01:10:23.366
I'm just gonna give you
guys a couple minutes,

01:10:23.368 --> 01:10:26.669
then we have to move him.

01:10:27.705 --> 01:10:29.772
You okay?

01:10:29.774 --> 01:10:31.574
You wanna be alone?

01:10:31.576 --> 01:10:33.676
No.

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.691
Hey...

01:11:11.448 --> 01:11:13.716
I'm just glad he's
gonna be all right.

01:11:13.718 --> 01:11:16.319
- Me too.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:19.889
Oh, honey.

01:11:21.926 --> 01:11:24.394
Oh...
thank you, Mitch.

01:11:24.396 --> 01:11:26.196
Thank you so much.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:28.831
Okay. I'll see you both at home.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:31.367
- Drive safe, mom.
- Okay.

01:11:34.605 --> 01:11:36.606
I'm just happy he's coming
home in a few days.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:38.408
That's great.

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:41.211
It's Jake. I don't want
to deal with that right now.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:44.314
You wanna go get something to eat?

01:11:45.549 --> 01:11:47.817
You know, I know my timing
kinda sucks right now,

01:11:47.819 --> 01:11:50.620
but, um... I think I'm gonna go.

01:11:50.622 --> 01:11:52.622
Oh, okay.
Um...

01:11:52.624 --> 01:11:54.657
See you at the house.

01:11:54.659 --> 01:11:57.293
No. I mean I'm gonna leave.

01:11:57.295 --> 01:11:58.661
Like for good?

01:11:58.663 --> 01:12:01.497
Mitch, we still have the wedding.

01:12:01.499 --> 01:12:02.799
I need you there.

01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:05.401
- You don't need me there.
- Yes, I do.

01:12:05.403 --> 01:12:08.838
Why?
Why do you need me there?

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.241
It's your wedding,
for Christ's sake.

01:12:11.243 --> 01:12:15.245
You never really talked
to me like that before.

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:17.313
And you know what, Mitch?

01:12:17.315 --> 01:12:19.949
You're right.
Your timing could not be worse.

01:12:19.951 --> 01:12:22.852
Why is it so important that
I be at your wedding, huh?

01:12:22.854 --> 01:12:24.454
You wanna rub it in my face?

01:12:24.456 --> 01:12:27.323
Rub it in your face?
What are you talking about?

01:12:27.325 --> 01:12:28.625
God, jeez...

01:12:28.627 --> 01:12:30.360
Jake is right.
I am a wuss.

01:12:30.362 --> 01:12:32.028
You might as well just
make me the maid of honor.

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:33.563
What does that mean?

01:12:33.565 --> 01:12:35.565
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

01:12:35.567 --> 01:12:38.301
I'm in love with you.

01:12:40.671 --> 01:12:42.739
Why would you tell me that?

01:12:42.741 --> 01:12:46.876
I've wanted to tell you that
since the first time I met you.

01:12:46.878 --> 01:12:52.415
Do you know why I came to find you?

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:54.784
Do you remember what
we said to each other?

01:12:54.786 --> 01:12:56.419
The day before graduation.

01:12:58.489 --> 01:13:00.323
Ten years ago.

01:13:01.592 --> 01:13:03.860
Tell me.

01:13:03.862 --> 01:13:06.462
Mitch, tell me.

01:13:13.871 --> 01:13:17.006
Take care of yourself.

01:13:32.623 --> 01:13:34.490
Hey.

01:13:34.492 --> 01:13:37.093
Donna filled me in.
Are you okay?

you, it's all tax deductible.

01:16:13.651 --> 01:16:15.685
It is.

01:16:15.687 --> 01:16:17.553
Let's go through last
month's projected

01:16:17.555 --> 01:16:18.955

01:16:18.957 --> 01:16:21.224

You look beautiful.

01:17:19.183 --> 01:17:22.785
Your father would be so...

01:17:22.787 --> 01:17:25.054
Proud today.

01:17:25.056 --> 01:17:27.857
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:27.859 --> 01:17:29.892
Elizabeth...

01:17:29.894 --> 01:17:31.961
You need to stop.

01:17:31.963 --> 01:17:35.631
Mitch isn't coming.

01:17:35.633 --> 01:17:38.901
I know. I just can't
stop thinking about him.

01:17:38.903 --> 01:17:42.638
It's my wedding day, and all
I think about is Mitch.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.775
It may sound strange, but I
keep thinking about him too.

01:17:45.777 --> 01:17:47.877
- Mother!
- What?

01:17:47.879 --> 01:17:49.712
He's a nice republican.

01:17:49.714 --> 01:17:51.647
He's actually a
registered independent.

01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:54.884
On the outside.
Not in here.

01:17:56.253 --> 01:17:58.087
I miss him.

01:18:02.859 --> 01:18:04.126
Is she here?

01:18:04.128 --> 01:18:05.695
You're not supposed to be here.

01:18:05.697 --> 01:18:08.331
Donna, I'm gonna be married to
this woman in about 30 minutes.

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:09.899
I think it's okay if
I see her now, okay?

01:18:09.901 --> 01:18:12.969
No, no. Not until
she walks down that aisle.

01:18:12.971 --> 01:18:14.704
Fine. Fine.

01:18:14.706 --> 01:18:16.205
You haven't seen Mitch
around, have you?

01:18:16.207 --> 01:18:18.040
- No. He isn't here.
- Good.

01:18:18.042 --> 01:18:20.042
'Cause the next time I see
him, I'm gonna put him

01:18:20.044 --> 01:18:22.178
- in the hospital... you got it?
- Will you stop with that?

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:28.217
He's the one who saved buddy
after you hit him and took off.

01:18:28.219 --> 01:18:30.886
Besides... They made
a pact ten years ago

01:18:30.888 --> 01:18:33.656
to marry each other only
for him to find out

01:18:33.658 --> 01:18:35.291
that she's marrying you instead.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:37.360
So I think I'd cut him
a little slack, honey.

01:18:37.362 --> 01:18:38.961
They made a pact?

01:18:38.963 --> 01:18:41.364
Gosh, Donna,
I don't know what to say.

01:18:41.366 --> 01:18:44.200
That's so touching.
Come on, are you kidding me?

01:18:44.202 --> 01:18:45.735
Who the hell even does that?

01:18:45.737 --> 01:18:47.236
And that whole buddy
thing, by the way?

01:18:47.238 --> 01:18:49.338
I was trying to protect
my family's reputation.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:51.941
Go back to your friends, Jake.

01:18:51.943 --> 01:18:53.142
We'll see you downstairs.

01:18:53.144 --> 01:18:55.878
Yeah, I'll see you downstairs.

01:19:00.751 --> 01:19:03.419
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

01:19:03.421 --> 01:19:07.323
It's terrific. So...

01:19:07.325 --> 01:19:10.192
You ready to get married?

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.901
How's dad?

01:19:18.903 --> 01:19:23.406
Well, look, I'm gonna see you
guys Sunday anyway, okay?

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:26.242
Yes, I'm still coming for dinner.

01:19:26.244 --> 01:19:27.977
Okay?

01:19:27.979 --> 01:19:31.280
I love you too.

01:19:31.282 --> 01:19:32.848
All right, bye.

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.100
Buddy?

01:19:51.102 --> 01:19:53.102
Buddy!
Ha ha ha!

01:19:53.104 --> 01:19:55.471
Is that you?
You look great?

01:19:55.473 --> 01:20:00.309
I was about to say the
same thing about you.

01:20:00.311 --> 01:20:04.046
Looks like someone took up jogging.

01:20:04.048 --> 01:20:05.848
What are you doing here?

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:09.885
I just thought that you'd like to
see that buddy was doing okay.

01:20:09.887 --> 01:20:14.790
So you came all the way to
Boston to tell me buddy's okay.

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:18.427
No, actually, I came
all the way to Boston

01:20:18.429 --> 01:20:21.197
to show you that buddy was okay.

01:20:21.199 --> 01:20:23.933
Why would you do that?

01:20:25.769 --> 01:20:26.836
Well...

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:37.046
Will you stop with that?

01:20:37.048 --> 01:20:42.251
He's the one who saved buddy
after you hit him and took off.

01:20:42.253 --> 01:20:45.488
Besides... They made
a pact ten years ago

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:48.190
to marry each other,
only for him to find out

01:20:48.192 --> 01:20:51.360
that she's marrying you instead.

01:21:22.058 --> 01:21:24.994
- Everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

01:21:24.996 --> 01:21:28.230
It's terrific. So...

01:21:28.232 --> 01:21:30.933
You ready to get married?

01:21:55.158 --> 01:21:58.093
Sorry.

01:22:12.909 --> 01:22:15.511
Whoa, compadre.
Where do you think you're going?

01:22:15.513 --> 01:22:17.313
Who the hell are you?
Get your hands off me!

01:22:17.315 --> 01:22:18.914
Ow! Ow!

01:22:18.916 --> 01:22:21.550
Now, we can do this the easy
way, or we can do this my way.

01:22:21.552 --> 01:22:23.519
- It's your choice.
- Mother... ow! Ow!

01:22:23.521 --> 01:22:26.055
Okay. It's my way.
Let's go.

01:22:31.528 --> 01:22:35.064
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

01:22:35.066 --> 01:22:38.634
I'm sorry to inform you, but there will
no longer be a wedding here today.

01:22:38.636 --> 01:22:41.604
It seems that the bride to be
has had a change of heart.

01:22:41.606 --> 01:22:43.873
And as I look around
this beautiful setting,

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.542
it seems none of you are shocked.

01:22:47.911 --> 01:22:50.980
Excuse me, but you're
hurting my son.

01:22:50.982 --> 01:22:53.515
- Yes, I am.
- Would you please stop?

01:22:53.517 --> 01:22:55.417
Where's Donna?

01:22:57.622 --> 01:23:00.022
No worries.
Elizabeth called me.

01:23:00.024 --> 01:23:01.156
Jake, it's over.

01:23:01.158 --> 01:23:04.026
Don't come looking
for Elizabeth... Ever.

01:23:04.028 --> 01:23:06.095
If you do, you're not
gonna find her...

01:23:06.097 --> 01:23:07.196
you're gonna find me.

01:23:07.198 --> 01:23:08.931
And I'm from Texas.

01:23:11.068 --> 01:23:13.102
That means I'll barbecue his ass!

01:23:13.104 --> 01:23:15.504
Oh!

01:23:15.506 --> 01:23:17.406
- Y...
- No.

01:23:17.408 --> 01:23:19.508
Learn to leave on a high note.

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:21.644
You gonna be okay?

01:23:21.646 --> 01:23:23.913
I'll be fine.
Take care of her.

01:23:23.915 --> 01:23:26.215
- Will do.
- Thank you.

01:23:26.217 --> 01:23:28.217
Good night, everybody.

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:35.691
You know what, guys?

01:23:35.693 --> 01:23:38.027
I'm gonna go catch the Laker game.

01:23:42.032 --> 01:23:44.333
You don't have to worry
about him anymore.

01:23:44.335 --> 01:23:46.168
Ha ha ha!
So where we heading?

01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:50.039
- Boston.
- Ha ha! Beantown. Sweet!

01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:52.675
Hey, baby, we just picked her up.

01:23:52.677 --> 01:23:55.444
- We're on our way.
- Hold on, girls.

01:23:55.446 --> 01:23:57.546
Whoo-hoo!

01:23:57.548 --> 01:24:00.182
- Whoo!
- Yee-haw!

01:24:00.184 --> 01:24:04.053
And we didn't stop
until we got here.

01:24:07.123 --> 01:24:08.324
Why would you do that?

01:24:08.326 --> 01:24:10.125
I needed to see you.

01:24:10.127 --> 01:24:13.629
I wanted to make things
right between us.

01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:18.400
Well...

01:24:18.402 --> 01:24:20.369
You saw me.

01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:23.105
You...

01:24:23.107 --> 01:24:25.641
buddy looks great.

01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:28.010
Mitch, wait.

01:24:32.015 --> 01:24:34.183
It was the day of graduation,

01:24:34.185 --> 01:24:38.620
and you were talking to Dave
and I went over to steal you.

01:24:38.622 --> 01:24:42.458
I told you what a special
friend you were to me...

01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:47.429
And if I have a regret it's
that I never gave you a chance.

01:24:47.431 --> 01:24:52.001
I never gave us a chance.

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:56.138
So here I am asking for a chance.

01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.741
Mitch Becker, will
you do me the honor

01:24:58.743 --> 01:25:03.612
of fulfilling a promise
that I made to you?

01:25:03.614 --> 01:25:05.781
Will you marry me?

01:25:05.783 --> 01:25:08.584
I love you, and I wanna
spend the rest...

01:25:08.586 --> 01:25:10.753
wait, stop.

01:25:10.755 --> 01:25:14.656
I must have gone over this moment a
thousand times in my head and...

01:25:14.658 --> 01:25:19.428
Never once did I ever imagine it was
going to be you proposing to me.

01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:21.563
You're the love of my life.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.269
Course I'm gonna marry you.

01:25:31.775 --> 01:25:34.243
Wait, wait.
One condition.

01:25:34.245 --> 01:25:37.146
We don't... we don't wait.
We do this.

01:25:37.148 --> 01:25:40.516
No engagement.
No ceremony.

01:25:40.518 --> 01:25:42.084
No photographers.

01:25:42.086 --> 01:25:44.486
We just...
We do this right now.

01:25:44.488 --> 01:25:47.356
We go down to city hall
and do it... what do you say?

01:25:47.358 --> 01:25:48.424
Deal?

01:25:48.426 --> 01:25:49.825
I think I can do one better.

01:25:49.827 --> 01:25:53.262
<i>♪ It's such a long
way back to you ♪</i>

01:25:53.264 --> 01:25:54.430
Hey, it's me.

01:25:54.432 --> 01:25:57.433
Hold on, I'm gonna
put you on speaker.

01:25:57.435 --> 01:25:59.568
Okay, you're on.

01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:01.537
What's up, my brother?

01:26:01.539 --> 01:26:04.640
- Rudy!
- Hey, Mitch, what's happening?

01:26:04.642 --> 01:26:06.742
Oh, my gosh, Laura, how are...

01:26:06.744 --> 01:26:09.144
- is Dave with you?
- He sure is.

01:26:09.146 --> 01:26:12.247
<i>And I'm with her.</i>
<i>Ha ha ha!</i>

01:26:12.249 --> 01:26:13.582
So, man, any news.

01:26:13.584 --> 01:26:16.718
Well, I think we need pastor Rudy.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.720
- We're getting married.
- Oh, congratulations.

01:26:18.722 --> 01:26:20.222
There you go, my man.
All right!

01:26:20.224 --> 01:26:22.324
Wait, wait.
Rudy's a pastor?

01:26:22.326 --> 01:26:23.525
Hell, yeah.

01:26:23.527 --> 01:26:25.094
Online, baby.

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:26.528
You can get a license or anything.

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:28.831
How soon can you be here?
We wanna do it today.

01:26:28.833 --> 01:26:30.866
Uh, half an hour?

01:26:30.868 --> 01:26:33.268
Okay, we'll see you soon.

01:26:35.805 --> 01:26:39.608
You know, they did say
that we had 30 minutes.
