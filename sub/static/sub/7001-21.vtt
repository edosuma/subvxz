01:13.289 --> 01:17.599
- Mom. I can't find the hose.
- What do you want it for, anyway?

01:17.690 --> 01:21.160
- Oh, nothing. Just something to do.
- Why don't you read a book?

01:21.250 --> 01:23.599
You can't make mud
with a book.

01:23.690 --> 01:24.670
Mud?

01:24.769 --> 01:27.960
We're playing commandos. We're putting
the mud on our faces for camouflage.

01:28.049 --> 01:29.400
No mud.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.950
Oh, man.

01:32.049 --> 01:34.839
Wait a second, wait a second.
You really want your faces dirty?

01:34.930 --> 01:37.200
- Yeah.
- OK, come here.

01:38.170 --> 01:40.359
All right, take a sharp right.

01:40.450 --> 01:42.829
All right, watch out for pedestrians
and the refrigerator.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.039
Got it. Dad.
Beep! Beep!

01:46.130 --> 01:48.200
- Hey, guys.
- Hi. Dad.

01:48.289 --> 01:51.960
What?
Are you giving each other facials?

01:52.049 --> 01:54.200
No.
We're playing commandos.

01:54.289 --> 01:57.990
What? Are you attacking a beauty salon,
or something?

01:58.089 --> 01:58.599
Hi, honey.

01:58.690 --> 02:02.799
The auto parts god. Gearshift, has shined
on me. I found this today at the junkyard.

02:06.049 --> 02:10.519
That's my woman. Woman,
watch your man weld, fire, metal, heat.

02:10.609 --> 02:13.359
Oh, Tim. look out for the…

02:13.450 --> 02:15.599
..pottery wheel.

02:16.210 --> 02:18.000
Oh, that had to hurt.

02:18.089 --> 02:20.119
Try it,
tell me what you think.

02:20.210 --> 02:23.319
Uh, Mark. I think maybe you should
go play commandos with your big bros.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.519
Wow, cool.

02:26.529 --> 02:29.039
What's this doing in the garage? I thought
we wanted to put it in the basement.

02:29.130 --> 02:31.589
Well, we were,
but I can't work down there.

02:31.690 --> 02:34.480
Oh, come on. It'll be quiet,
the kids won't go down there.

02:34.569 --> 02:38.160
It's just damp,
and there are bugs.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.279
Well. I'll get you a sponge
and an anteater, or something.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.759
Now, look.
My pottery teacher said that I should work

02:45.849 --> 02:48.920
where the creative energy
feels the strongest.

02:49.009 --> 02:53.869
And since Paris is out of the question.
I picked the garage and I really like it.

02:54.089 --> 02:58.079
Well. I… I don't think it's creative energy
you're sensing. This is grease energy. It's…

02:58.170 --> 03:01.680
It's man energy, and it's…
Boy, it's tough, even for a woman like you.

03:01.769 --> 03:06.119
This'd suck the estrogen
right out of you, honey.

03:07.650 --> 03:13.039
What you really mean is that
it's your garage and I don't belong here.

03:13.170 --> 03:17.039
What I really mean is it's our garage,
and you don't belong out here.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.190
Yeah. I see.

03:18.289 --> 03:22.240
Now, didn't we agree
to put this in the basement, hon?

03:22.329 --> 03:24.630
OK. You got it.
Move it.

03:24.730 --> 03:27.759
- Great. Get the door for me.
- All right.

03:27.849 --> 03:30.230
- How many guys brought this in here?
- Just one little skinny guy.

03:30.329 --> 03:32.200
OK.

03:35.170 --> 03:36.880
Ah, gee!

03:36.970 --> 03:41.480
Tim, you're gonna hurt your back.
You need to lift with your legs.

03:41.569 --> 03:44.319
Is that what he did?

03:44.410 --> 03:46.680
No, he had a forklift.

03:50.410 --> 03:54.079
Look, your area is way over there,
mine is way over here.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.730
If I bother you,
you can just tell me and I'll leave.

03:56.809 --> 03:58.119
Good.

03:58.210 --> 03:59.039
- Jill?
- What?

03:59.130 --> 04:02.039
You're bothering me.

04:02.130 --> 04:05.079
I'm kidding.
We'll share the garage. Good.

04:05.170 --> 04:08.359
I was just concerned
about your safety.

04:08.450 --> 04:12.200
I gotta put on the steering box today,
and you know what that means?

04:12.289 --> 04:15.799
Welding.
Sparks, heat.

04:15.890 --> 04:17.399
Noise.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.358
Sweat.

04:19.450 --> 04:22.880
Wow. We should have
welded on our honeymoon.

04:24.970 --> 04:26.279
Once you've installed your drawer.

04:26.369 --> 04:29.119
it's always a good idea
to slide 'er in a couple times.

04:33.569 --> 04:36.200
Just to make sure
it's seated properly on the track.

04:36.289 --> 04:39.799
You can always be confident now, because
the stop will prevent the drawer…

04:39.890 --> 04:42.450
Jeez, Al!

04:42.529 --> 04:43.640
Thanks. Warren.

04:43.730 --> 04:48.359
Al, you didn't…
you didn't get the stop in there.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.160
I believe that was your job, Tim.

04:51.250 --> 04:55.759
Al. I believe you're my assistant. You're
supposed to check up my work, right?

04:55.849 --> 04:59.599
That's what a good assistant does,
right, Al?

04:59.690 --> 05:02.359
A good assistant
does a lot more than that, Tim.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.279
You're right, Al.

05:04.369 --> 05:07.880
And that's why Al and I
plan these minor slip-ups.

05:07.970 --> 05:11.359
to demonstrate the importance
of how a good assistant

05:11.450 --> 05:14.160
can prevent accidents like this.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.319
Isn't that right, Al?

05:16.849 --> 05:19.230
I don't think so, Tim.

05:22.049 --> 05:25.720
I think what Al means is,
if you're not careful and watch your step.

05:25.809 --> 05:28.480
you can screw up,
just like Al did.

05:31.210 --> 05:34.480
Tool Time tip:
don't be like Al.

05:35.609 --> 05:38.170
See you next time, everybody.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.190
Bye, guys.

05:44.289 --> 05:46.119
- Good night. Lisa.
- Good night. Lisa.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.799
i9  .  .

05:48.809 --> 05:50.720
7.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.839
What's the matter, Allie?

05:55.289 --> 05:57.119
Woo-hoo?

05:57.210 --> 06:00.000
Ah, women troubles again, huh?

06:00.089 --> 06:02.680
Come on, tell me.
What's the matter?

06:02.769 --> 06:06.079
If you don't know.
I'm not going to tell you.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.440
Well, if you won't tell me,
how do I know?

06:09.529 --> 06:12.200
Tim, you embarrassed me today.

06:12.289 --> 06:16.359
Oh, that's no big deal.
I always embarrass you.

06:16.450 --> 06:20.319
Hey. The audience knows
I'm kidding around.

06:21.329 --> 06:24.039
I've gotten used to the fact
that you don't respect me.

06:24.130 --> 06:25.400
That's not true.

06:25.490 --> 06:29.240
But sometimes your constant clowning
is a mockery of home improvement.

06:29.329 --> 06:31.599
A mockery?

06:33.250 --> 06:34.519
Yes,

06:34.609 --> 06:39.039
And sometimes it's just
a little more than I can bear.

06:39.130 --> 06:41.160
Oh, come on, Al.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.160
You're not gonna cry, are you?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.440
i9  .

06:47.569 --> 06:50.519
I take my work seriously.
All you do is crack jokes.

06:50.609 --> 06:53.069
Crack jokes? Well, the way
you bend over like that, it's easy.

06:53.170 --> 06:56.119
Well, you see, now, that's…
that's what I'm talking about.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.799
Al, this show's part entertainment.

06:57.890 --> 07:01.430
It takes a lot of skill to entertain
the audience while we do our projects.

07:01.529 --> 07:03.319
Anyone can do what you do.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.279
Oh, really?
Do you think you can do what I do?

07:05.369 --> 07:10.519
Oh, please. How hard can it be
to tell bad jokes and screw up all the time?

07:15.849 --> 07:18.150
A lot harder than it looks.

07:20.410 --> 07:23.720
That isn't all that
you think I do, do you?

07:23.809 --> 07:25.119
Yes,

07:25.210 --> 07:27.799
And so do most of your viewers.

07:31.769 --> 07:35.079
Hey. I got an idea, Al.
This is one you're gonna like.

07:35.170 --> 07:41.119
Next time, why don't you try to host
the show, and I'll try to be the assistant?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.400
You really mean that?

07:45.329 --> 07:47.039
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

07:47.130 --> 07:52.279
We'll call it Tool Time,
with Al "I Take My Job Seriously" Borland.

07:52.369 --> 07:54.829
- Fine.
- Fine.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.200
- Fine.
- Fine.

07:58.609 --> 07:59.480
Fine.

08:01.289 --> 08:03.160
Hide.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.079
Oh, man.

08:08.170 --> 08:11.160
Where'd everybody go?

08:11.250 --> 08:14.359
Guess I have to do
that welding all by myself.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.079
Boy, that's a thirsty job.

08:17.170 --> 08:20.119
I'll get a big drink of water
before I go back out to the garage.

08:22.609 --> 08:25.119
Stop! No fair.
Cut it out.

08:25.210 --> 08:27.279
Do you surrender,
or more squirts here?

08:27.369 --> 08:29.279
You're not allowed
to squirt water in the house.

08:29.369 --> 08:31.359
Yeah.
We're gonna tell Mom.

08:31.450 --> 08:34.159
Ooh, commando's
gonna tell his mommy.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.318
- Yeah, you're gonna get in real big trouble.
- Oh, am I?

08:38.409 --> 08:40.279
My word against yours,
who do you think she's gonna believe?

08:40.369 --> 08:42.119
- Them.
- What you… Oh, honey.

08:42.210 --> 08:45.910
Stop squirting.
Now get some towels and clean this up.

08:46.009 --> 08:48.519
- Boy. I don't know where they get this.
- I do.

08:48.609 --> 08:49.920
- Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey.
- Prisoner. Put 'em up.

08:50.009 --> 08:52.240
All right, all right, all right.
I'm your prisoner.

08:52.329 --> 08:56.000
Do what you will to me.
Over and over.

08:57.769 --> 09:01.960
Let's face it, Tim.
With you, once it's over, it's over.

09:02.970 --> 09:06.039
Come here.
I want to show you something.

09:07.569 --> 09:09.079
Ta-da!

09:09.170 --> 09:11.470
- What do you think?
- Wow!

09:11.569 --> 09:14.079
Whatever it is, it's one
of the finest examples I've ever seen.

09:14.170 --> 09:16.079
No, no.
It's a bowl.

09:16.170 --> 09:20.480
No, Jill. It's…
It's so much more than that.

09:20.569 --> 09:22.559
No, come on.
This is not as easy as it looks.

09:22.650 --> 09:28.680
This is the first thing I've gotten
to stay standing up. I'm so proud of it.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.839
What's that smell?

09:30.930 --> 09:33.440
Oh, um,
it's some lavender potpourri.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.920
Lavender potpourri?

09:41.009 --> 09:44.759
This is the garage,
not the Liberace Museum.

09:45.329 --> 09:49.400
Just go back to your hot rod
and shut up.

10:08.289 --> 10:11.079
Jill. I can't work with this noise.

10:11.490 --> 10:13.869
How can you call that noise?

10:18.009 --> 10:21.480
That's not noise,
that's a proctology exam.

10:23.690 --> 10:25.119
Hey, come on.

10:25.210 --> 10:29.200
Honey, honey.
Ooh, ixnay, ixnay.

10:29.289 --> 10:32.160
You remember you promised
if you were bothering me you'd leave?

10:32.250 --> 10:34.599
- I'm not bothering you.
- Yes, you are.

10:34.690 --> 10:36.440
Well, don't be silly.
I'm not.

10:36.529 --> 10:38.079
If I say you're bothering me,
you're bothering me.

10:38.170 --> 10:41.000
Well, then, you leave.

10:41.089 --> 10:43.839
- I'm building my hot rod out here.
- Oh, and I'm just playing with clay.

10:43.930 --> 10:44.359
Yeah, well…

10:44.450 --> 10:48.200
Oh, so your stuff
is more important than my stuff.

10:49.210 --> 10:52.519
No, but at least
it's garagey stuff.

10:52.609 --> 10:56.389
You know, it's cars, it's tools, it's grease.
It's not this little artsy…

10:56.489 --> 10:58.869
Oh.

11:00.250 --> 11:03.280
I can fix this…
Hey, look at that.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.159
Mark, come out of there.

11:18.369 --> 11:21.719
Did your brothers
do this to you again?

11:21.809 --> 11:24.760
I can't tell you.
Randy told me not to.

11:24.849 --> 11:29.199
Don't untie me. Mom. I'm a prisoner. It's
the only way they'll let me play with them.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.559
Jill.

11:30.650 --> 11:33.210
I fixed the pot.

11:33.289 --> 11:35.400
You're not the only genius
in the family.

11:35.489 --> 11:36.519
Thanks.

11:36.610 --> 11:42.159
Well… it's not perfect,
but it's pretty close to the original.

11:46.329 --> 11:48.519
Did you break a pot too?

11:52.250 --> 11:55.789
- He's escaped. Book it.
- Hey, come back here.

11:58.289 --> 12:00.849
Randy, did you do this to him?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.000
The truth.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.920
Well. I tied him up,
but Brad put him in the closet.

12:08.010 --> 12:11.000
Hey, she didn't ask
anything about me.

12:11.090 --> 12:12.639
Now untie him.

12:12.730 --> 12:16.239
- Come on, Mark.
- I didn't tell on you.

12:16.329 --> 12:18.159
She found me.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.880
Jill.

12:19.969 --> 12:22.239
- What is this?
- This is a garage-use timetable.

12:22.329 --> 12:25.920
Since we can't share the garage together.
I thought we should share it separately.

12:26.010 --> 12:29.920
- Honey. I don't have any time on there.
- I gave you plenty of spaces.

12:30.010 --> 12:33.840
Oh, like between two and three
on Tuesdays? I work.

12:33.929 --> 12:37.239
Oh. That's right.
Well. I'll just take that space too.

12:39.130 --> 12:43.320
I love this, between 12 and 6 am.
That's when we sleep together.

12:43.409 --> 12:46.679
Now you're catching on, big boy.

12:49.210 --> 12:51.280
I should have never
let you into my garage in the first place.

12:51.369 --> 12:54.159
Aha! Your garage!
The truth comes out.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.920
Honey, you know what I mean.
I got the hot rod here. I got my tool bench.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.159
I've already given you a place
for the washing machines.

13:01.250 --> 13:06.960
I guess I should be grateful that you let me
come into your garage to do your laundry.

13:07.050 --> 13:09.880
What I'm trying to get at
is this is a man zone.

13:09.969 --> 13:11.679
Where is the woman zone, Tim?

13:11.769 --> 13:14.400
All I got is the garage.
You got the whole rest of the damn house.

13:14.489 --> 13:17.159
- To do what? Clean?
- No.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.880
Knit, sew, cook, vacuum…

13:19.969 --> 13:22.429
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.599
Ow!So am I.

13:26.090 --> 13:31.079
And now. Binford Tools
is proud to present Tool Time.

13:31.170 --> 13:36.360
With its very special guest host.
Al "The Tool Man" Borland.

13:42.409 --> 13:43.840
Hi.

13:44.130 --> 13:45.800
Hi.

13:45.889 --> 13:52.150
And… and welcome to Tool Time,
the show with more power…

13:56.250 --> 14:01.369
Ah, you all know my guest assistant.
Tim "The Assistant Man" Taylor.

14:05.289 --> 14:09.039
Tim and I are going
to be showing you today

14:09.130 --> 14:12.119
the proper method of installing

14:12.210 --> 14:16.559
decorative molding
around the interior of a doorway.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.840
Thank you. Lisa.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.519
Jeez, Al.

14:30.610 --> 14:33.039
Ah, Tim.

14:33.130 --> 14:36.159
Do you suppose
if Little Miss Muffet went through there.

14:36.250 --> 14:41.079
instead of a "doorway"
they'd call it a "curds and whey"?

14:43.889 --> 14:45.880
I don't think so, Al.

14:48.329 --> 14:50.320
Why not?

14:52.650 --> 14:56.320
That's
Al "I Take My Job Seriously" Borland…

14:57.409 --> 14:58.550
OK.

14:58.650 --> 15:00.199
So, uh…

15:00.289 --> 15:03.719
The most common
decorative molding are the casings.

15:03.809 --> 15:07.199
which go around
the doors and windows.

15:07.289 --> 15:12.440
and the, uh, baseboards -
thank you, Tim - which go on the, uh…

15:12.530 --> 15:14.909
Ah, the.
They go…

15:15.929 --> 15:19.079
- Bottom?
-. .bottom of the walls.

15:19.170 --> 15:23.639
And the crown molding,
which of course go up on… Oh.

15:25.449 --> 15:28.360
- Can I assist you with that, Al?
- Uh, no thank you, Tim.

15:28.449 --> 15:32.519
We could use a staple gun
right to your Adam's apple, Al.

15:32.610 --> 15:36.079
And you know,
speaking of staple guns, the, uh…

15:37.090 --> 15:43.429
Do… do you suppose that they call it a
staple gun because it shoots out staples?

15:46.289 --> 15:48.519
Yes. I do, Al.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.800
Well. I… I agree, Tim.

15:52.210 --> 15:55.750
All right, uh, first off
we're gonna get to our miter box here.

15:57.329 --> 15:58.360
Ah. Ah, so…

15:58.449 --> 16:02.150
But first. I would like
to get something off my chest…

16:02.250 --> 16:04.239
That tie?

16:06.329 --> 16:08.320
Uh…

16:09.369 --> 16:13.519
I… I'm just…
I'm just a little bit cheesed here.

16:15.289 --> 16:18.320
The, uh, the other day
I was in the supermarket.

16:18.409 --> 16:21.949
and I…
I was in the frozen food section.

16:22.809 --> 16:26.239
and they had lima beans
three for a dollar.

16:26.329 --> 16:29.039
And… and I took four.

16:29.130 --> 16:35.119
And… and the lady at the checkout counter
said. "Hey, can't you count?"

16:39.489 --> 16:41.159
Women, huh?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.679
Are you with me on this?

16:45.650 --> 16:47.119
Are you hot?

16:47.210 --> 16:53.000
Hey, Al. I'm having a little trouble
with your CutSaw back here, Al!

16:56.889 --> 16:58.320
I hope we didn't
scare anybody just then.

16:58.409 --> 17:01.559
but it was Al's idea
to stage a little disaster like this

17:01.650 --> 17:05.800
to demonstrate the importance of keeping
your concentration at the workplace.

17:05.888 --> 17:07.638
Right, Al?

17:07.730 --> 17:10.109
Uh, that's right, Tim.

17:11.368 --> 17:13.750
Get to your…
get to your molding, then.

17:13.848 --> 17:16.960
- Molding?
- Yeah, the molding, Al.

17:17.050 --> 17:20.519
You know, when I'm molding,
sometimes, cutting in a miter.

17:20.609 --> 17:24.309
I get splinters at the end of my wood.
What would you do about that, Al?

17:24.409 --> 17:26.789
Ah, well, you want
to take your tape.

17:26.888 --> 17:30.510
and tape the front of the molding
before you start your miter.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.119
Thank you, Al.

17:32.210 --> 17:35.360
No, thank yo4, Tim.

17:36.690 --> 17:40.639
Hey, Al. Do you suppose
they call this "molding"

17:40.730 --> 17:46.719
because it's made out of stuff that's
been in the refrigerator a little too long?

17:50.969 --> 17:53.920
I don't think so, Tim.

17:54.010 --> 17:57.710
Why don't we finish that molding off on
the first part of this? We'll cut that thing…

18:02.530 --> 18:05.119
Hey!
Don't do that to me.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.480
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.920
Nuh-uh, you're erasing
Mom's name from the chart.

18:10.010 --> 18:14.280
- I am not.
- Are too. Why's it say "Ji..:'?

18:15.130 --> 18:16.239
Code red, code red!

18:16.329 --> 18:17.360
Run!

18:17.449 --> 18:20.039
- Go, go!
- It's funny, huh?

18:20.130 --> 18:22.159
You better keep running,
or I'll get a garden hose.

18:22.250 --> 18:26.480
- Hi ho, good neighbor.
- Hey, Wilson. What are you up to?

18:27.170 --> 18:29.239
Just painting a self-portrait.

18:29.329 --> 18:31.079
Yeah, of who?

18:34.289 --> 18:37.639
- Well, Tim. I believe that would be of me.
- Yeah?

18:37.730 --> 18:40.920
- Can I see what you got so far?
- Sure, neighbor.

18:47.409 --> 18:50.119
- I got a question for you. Do you mind?
- Well, Tim.

18:50.210 --> 18:53.829
I would never
give you the brush-off.

18:53.929 --> 18:57.239
Jill is trying
to take over my garage.

18:57.329 --> 19:00.199
Hmm. I see.
A coup de garage.

19:01.650 --> 19:04.280
She just doesn't understand.
It's my garage.

19:04.369 --> 19:07.519
It's always been my garage. It's always
gonna be my garage. It's my zone.

19:07.610 --> 19:11.199
It'll never be her garage,
because it's mine, mine, mine.

19:11.289 --> 19:13.239
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

19:14.690 --> 19:17.519
- Well, Tim, men are territorial by nature.
- Yeah.

19:17.610 --> 19:22.079
When you describe the garage
as "yours, yours, yours".

19:22.170 --> 19:25.000
Jill's reaction is to protect
herself from feeling unwelcome.

19:25.090 --> 19:27.389
Yeah. I might have said
something to make her feel unwelcome.

19:27.489 --> 19:30.199
- Like what?
- I told her to get out!

19:32.369 --> 19:35.880
- Well, Tim, that could cause some friction.
- Yeah, friction.

19:35.969 --> 19:40.159
You have to understand, Tim,
life for women is connections.

19:40.250 --> 19:44.199
a struggle to avoid isolation
and preserve intimacy.

19:44.289 --> 19:46.000
- Uh, intimacy.
- Mm-hm.

19:46.090 --> 19:47.559
- Yeah, bingo.
- Hm?

19:47.650 --> 19:48.760
Intimacy.

19:48.849 --> 19:51.599
That's what it's all about.
Wilson, you're always right.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.199
Ah, ah, Tim, Tim.

19:53.289 --> 19:55.360
"Always" is
as dangerous a word as "never".

19:55.449 --> 19:57.119
No, no, no.
This makes perfect sense.

19:57.210 --> 20:02.360
Jill put that potter's wheel in the garage
to be near me, to spend more time with me.

20:02.449 --> 20:04.440
Thanks, Wilson.

20:07.090 --> 20:09.960
- Listen, Jill. I think I understand…
- Good.

20:10.050 --> 20:12.480
No, no, no, no. You didn't
let me finish what I understand.

20:12.570 --> 20:17.639
Doesn't matter. If you understand
something, that's enough for me.

20:17.730 --> 20:21.679
I know why you put
the potter's wheel in the garage.

20:22.690 --> 20:24.119
And why did I do that, Tim?

20:24.210 --> 20:29.119
It's your struggle
with isolation to preserve friction.

20:30.449 --> 20:32.280
What?

20:32.369 --> 20:35.559
It's all about intimacy.
You just want to spend more time with me.

20:35.650 --> 20:37.949
No, Tim.

20:38.050 --> 20:41.159
The reason I'm taking pottery
is so I can get away from you.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.320
- What?
- I need some time alone.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.519
- This isn't anything to do with intimacy?
- No.

20:45.610 --> 20:52.199
I need some time and space to do
something that I enjoy, for myself, for me.

20:52.289 --> 20:55.320
When I don't have
to think about you and the kids.

20:55.409 --> 20:58.159
There's a fine how-do-you-do.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.789
- I always think about you.
- Oh, really?

21:01.889 --> 21:03.760
Even when you're watching football?

21:03.849 --> 21:06.309
Especially when I'm watching football.

21:06.409 --> 21:08.400
Yeah. I sit down and watch football.
I'm always thinking:

21:08.489 --> 21:13.320
"God, if Jill were here,
she could get me another beer."

21:16.289 --> 21:19.320
face it, Tim.
We both need time away from each other.

21:19.409 --> 21:22.559
- And that's what this is all about?
- Yeah.

21:22.650 --> 21:26.429
And if we have
the time away from each other.

21:26.530 --> 21:30.199
then we can appreciate
the time that we do have together.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.510
Oh.

21:31.610 --> 21:33.800
- Like now.
- Yeah?

21:33.889 --> 21:37.119
Kids are off at the park
playing commandos.

21:37.210 --> 21:42.150
I notice that somebody erased my name
from the next hour on the garage timetable.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.199
It's just you and me.

21:44.289 --> 21:46.559
Got any ideas about
what we could be doing?

21:46.650 --> 21:49.030
I'm getting one.

21:51.329 --> 21:53.079
And what would that be?

21:53.170 --> 21:55.159
Work on the hot rod.

22:02.369 --> 22:04.360
Oh, ho ho.

22:09.409 --> 22:13.280
You won't believe it, but you were wrong.
Wilson, Jill didn't want intimacy.

22:13.369 --> 22:14.719
Is that so?

22:14.809 --> 22:18.480
And you'll never guess
what she really wanted.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.559
- A little more time to herself?
- Huh?

22:21.650 --> 22:24.360
You see, Tim,
as Khalil Gibran said:

22:24.449 --> 22:27.840
"for the pillars of the temple
stand apart.

22:28.039 --> 22:31.579
and the oak tree and the cypress
grow not in each other's shadow.''

22:31.680 --> 22:34.990
Ah. that's beautiful.
Oh. yeah. it is. yeah.

22:36.359 --> 22:38.740
I have no idea
what you just said.

22:40.039 --> 22:43.470
I just mean that occasionally.
it's healthy for you and Jill to be apart.

22:43.559 --> 22:47.470
- Why didn't you say that in the first place?
- It just came to me.

22:47.559 --> 22:52.190
Sometimes it's not good
to get me too early in the day, Tim.
