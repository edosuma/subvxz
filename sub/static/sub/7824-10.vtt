( horn honks )

01:04.790 --> 01:05.390
( screams )

01:30.070 --> 01:30.610
Gah!

01:31.400 --> 01:32.100
( barking )

01:40.680 --> 01:41.880
Uh-oh.

01:41.950 --> 01:43.920
I think the boy's hurt.

01:43.980 --> 01:45.340
For crying out loud.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.920
Just give him a nickel,
and let's get going.

01:47.990 --> 01:51.390
( honks horn )
I think we should
call an ambulance, sir.

01:55.530 --> 01:56.560
Hey, cool.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.930
I'm dead.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.300
Man:
<i>Please hold on
to the handrail.</i>

02:07.370 --> 02:09.800
<i>Do not spit over the side.</i>

02:09.880 --> 02:12.450
<i>Por favor, aguantese
en la baranda.</i>

02:12.510 --> 02:13.980
<i>No escupa...</i>

02:14.050 --> 02:18.590
Aunt Hortense...
Great Grampa Simpson.

02:18.650 --> 02:21.020
Snowball.

02:21.090 --> 02:22.520
<i>Do not spit over the side.</i>

02:27.790 --> 02:30.420
<i>We told you to hold on
to the handrail.</i>

02:30.500 --> 02:33.200
<i>We asked you not to spit
over the side.</i>

02:41.640 --> 02:42.840
Howdy, stranger.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.450
I'm Bart Simpson.

02:44.510 --> 02:46.280
Who the hell are you?

02:46.350 --> 02:48.420
Please allow me
to introduce myself.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.850
I'm the devil.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.290
( evil laugh )
And you've earned
eternal damnation

02:52.350 --> 02:55.160
for your lifetime
of evil deeds, Bart.

02:55.220 --> 02:56.820
Spitting off the escalator
just clinched it.

02:56.890 --> 02:58.630
Hey, I'm innocent, man.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.730
( <i>laughing )</i>

03:01.790 --> 03:03.050
Innocent, huh?

03:03.130 --> 03:04.900
Everybody's innocent.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.120
Okay.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.370
Let's just pull up
your file here.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.670
Hmm... <i>seems to be
a mistake.</i>

03:12.740 --> 03:14.010
According to this, you're not
due to arrive here

03:14.070 --> 03:15.670
until the next time
the Yankees win the pennant.

03:15.740 --> 03:17.210
That's nearly
a century from now.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.480
Boy, is my face red.

03:19.550 --> 03:21.650
<i>Bart? Bart?</i>

03:21.710 --> 03:23.640
Say, is there
anything I can do

03:23.720 --> 03:25.320
to avoid
coming back here?

03:25.380 --> 03:28.450
Oh, sure, yeah,
but you wouldn't like it.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.660
Okay. See you later, then.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.830
Good-bye, Bart.

03:30.890 --> 03:32.830
Remember... lie,
cheat, steal

03:32.890 --> 03:34.930
and listen
to heavy metal music.

03:34.990 --> 03:36.850
Yes, sir.

03:43.370 --> 03:46.510
Intercom: <i>Doctor Warner, you're
wanted in radiology, please.</i>

03:46.570 --> 03:47.710
He's awake!

03:47.770 --> 03:50.030
Oh, Bart, we thought
for a minute

03:50.110 --> 03:51.780
you'd gone away from us.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.300
I did go away,
Mom.

03:53.380 --> 03:56.120
I was miles and miles
and miles away

03:56.180 --> 03:58.450
writhing in agony
in the pits of hell

03:58.520 --> 04:00.020
and you were there.

04:00.090 --> 04:02.020
And you and you
and you...

04:02.090 --> 04:03.990
You I've
never seen before.

04:04.060 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, who are you?
I saw you chasing
Bart's ambulance.

04:07.060 --> 04:09.830
Hutz is the name, Mr. Simpson.
Lionel Hutz, attorney at law.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.230
Here's my card.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.230
It turns into a sponge
when you put it in water.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.770
Ooh, classy.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.360
I'd like to talk to you about
bringing legal action

04:17.440 --> 04:19.839
against the fiend who did this
to your boy.

04:19.910 --> 04:23.340
Well, the fiend who did this
to my boy is my boss.

04:23.410 --> 04:25.110
Besides, the doctor says

04:25.180 --> 04:28.850
it's just a bump on the head
and a broken toe.
Nothing serious.

04:28.910 --> 04:31.080
Doctors. Doctors are idiots.

04:31.150 --> 04:34.560
There's no telling what kind
of permanent injuries
he might have.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.490
You might have
to wait on him
hand and foot

04:36.560 --> 04:38.560
for the rest
of his natural life.

04:38.620 --> 04:39.950
That's the downside.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.000
Now here's the good part.

04:42.060 --> 04:45.230
- You can <i>ching, ching, ching,
cash in on this tragedy.
- Wow.</i>

04:45.300 --> 04:46.470
Excuse me, Mr. Hutz.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.370
Are you a shyster?

04:48.430 --> 04:50.860
How does a nice little girl
like you, know a big word
like that?

04:50.940 --> 04:53.410
Mr. Hutz, this is hardly
the time or place

04:53.470 --> 04:54.910
to discuss this.

04:54.970 --> 04:57.340
You're right, you're right.
When you feel up to it

04:57.410 --> 04:59.550
come over to my office
and we'll talk about it.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.380
Lionel Hutz,
attorney at law.

05:01.450 --> 05:03.120
<i>What's that,
a broken neck?
Great!</i>

05:04.320 --> 05:05.290
Hello, Dr. Hibbert.

05:05.350 --> 05:06.890
Hello, Lisa.

05:06.950 --> 05:09.360
Well, we've got a nasty bump
on our head, haven't we?

05:09.420 --> 05:10.560
Ow! Quit it.

05:10.620 --> 05:11.950
And a little tiny
broken toe.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.250
Ow. quit it.

05:13.330 --> 05:16.630
Is he well enough for me
to mother him unbearably?

05:16.700 --> 05:19.400
Mmm, better let him
rest up a while first.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.560
Hey, Simpson

05:20.630 --> 05:22.990
I heard Mr. Burns
crushed your boy.

05:23.070 --> 05:25.410
Yeah. If I wasn't so spineless

05:25.470 --> 05:29.510
I'd march into Mr. Burns'
office right now and...

05:29.580 --> 05:30.450
Simpson.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.150
( <i>screams )</i>

05:32.210 --> 05:34.350
- Mr. Burns wants you to march
into his office right now.
- Uh-oh.

05:37.180 --> 05:39.980
Ah, Simpson, at last we meet.

05:40.050 --> 05:42.320
Nice to meet you too, sir.

05:42.390 --> 05:44.260
My attorneys
have advised me

05:44.320 --> 05:46.680
to pay you
for running over your child

05:46.760 --> 05:48.460
so I'm cutting you
a check.

05:48.530 --> 05:49.930
Really? Great.

05:52.030 --> 05:54.240
( <i>straining )</i>

05:56.300 --> 05:59.610
$100.  Of course,
you'll have to sign a waiver

05:59.670 --> 06:02.710
relinquishing your right
to sue and so forth.
Merely a formality.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.200
A hundred bucks?

06:04.280 --> 06:09.050
It's a very generous offer, sir,
but medical bills alone...

06:09.110 --> 06:12.410
Oh, so extortion is the name
of your little game,
is it Simpson?

06:12.480 --> 06:14.380
Very well.
Then you get nothing.

06:14.450 --> 06:17.420
I have the finest lawyers
in Springfield.

06:17.490 --> 06:18.730
Tangle with me

06:18.790 --> 06:21.400
and I'll crush you
like a paper cup.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.600
( <i>straining )</i>

06:25.930 --> 06:27.600
Throw him out, Smithers.

06:27.670 --> 06:30.400
You don't have
to do that, Mr. Burns.

06:30.470 --> 06:32.110
I can throw
myself out.

06:34.010 --> 06:34.680
( door slams )

06:36.440 --> 06:38.280
Ooh... Lionel Hutz.

06:42.980 --> 06:44.690
Right in here,
Mr. Simpson.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.790
Any calls, Della?

06:45.850 --> 06:47.260
Calls? Oh, calls.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.960
Yes, uh, the Supreme Court
called again.

06:50.020 --> 06:53.190
They need your help
on some freedom thing.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.260
Tell them
to sit tight.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.260
I'll get back
to them.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.700
This way,
Mr. Simpson.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.630
You sure have got
some education, Mr. Hutz.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.040
Yes, Harvard, Yale

07:03.100 --> 07:05.240
M.I.T., Oxford, The Sorbonne,
The Louvre...

07:06.770 --> 07:09.210
( siren begins wailing )
Oh. Oh, well.

07:09.270 --> 07:12.370
Mr. Simpson, the state bar
forbids me

07:12.440 --> 07:15.640
from promising you
a big cash settlement

07:15.710 --> 07:18.010
but just between you and me

07:18.080 --> 07:20.980
I promise you
a big cash settlement.

07:21.050 --> 07:22.250
My fee is 50%.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.660
50%?

07:23.720 --> 07:25.490
You'll be getting more
than just a lawyer, Mr. Simpson.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.060
You'll also be getting

07:27.130 --> 07:31.170
this exquisite <i>fauxpearl
necklace-- a $99 value--</i>

07:31.230 --> 07:32.430
as our gift to you.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.240
Well, I don't know.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.910
You and I might have
different ideas

07:37.970 --> 07:41.280
about just how big
a big cash settlement is.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.840
A million dollars?

07:42.910 --> 07:45.510
Whoo, hoo! I stand corrected.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.850
A million bucks is a-okay.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.610
( <i>wolf whistle )</i>

07:57.670 --> 08:01.740
Now we'll get
a <i>real doctor's opinion.</i>

08:01.810 --> 08:04.050
Bad news.

08:04.110 --> 08:04.970
Oh?

08:05.050 --> 08:07.390
Your son is
a very sick boy.

08:07.450 --> 08:09.520
Just look at the x-rays.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.680
You see that dark spot there?

08:11.750 --> 08:12.950
Whiplash.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.730
Whiplash? Oh, no.

08:14.790 --> 08:18.030
And this smudge here
that looks like my fingerprint?

08:18.090 --> 08:20.620
No, that's trauma.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.000
Mmm.

08:22.060 --> 08:23.320
Am I gonna die?

08:23.400 --> 08:25.570
Yes, son.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.890
Homer!

08:26.970 --> 08:30.040
No, of course you're not
going to die.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.840
Everything's fine.

08:31.910 --> 08:33.950
Will I ever play baseball again?

08:34.010 --> 08:35.250
No!

08:35.309 --> 08:36.580
( <i>sobbing )</i>

08:36.650 --> 08:38.919
But I played baseball
this morning.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.480
That's right,
he did.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.090
Excuse me, but
Dr. Hibbert has been

08:42.150 --> 08:44.520
our family physician
for years

08:44.590 --> 08:46.660
and he thought
Bart was fine.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.290
Oh, Dr. Hibbert

08:48.360 --> 08:50.260
( sarcastically )
from Johns Hopkins
Medical School.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.160
<i>With all due respect,
Mrs. Simpson.</i>

08:52.230 --> 08:53.760
you're not a doctor.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.870
The boy's not a doctor.
I'm not a doctor.

08:55.930 --> 08:58.570
The only person in this room
who even comes close

08:58.630 --> 08:59.460
is this man.

08:59.530 --> 09:01.960
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.340
Doctor, are you sure there isn't
soft tissue trauma

09:05.410 --> 09:06.810
<i>in the facial area?</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:09.350
Oh, yeah, tons of it.

09:09.410 --> 09:11.050
Just say when.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.570
<i>A million dollars?!</i>

09:13.650 --> 09:16.450
Smithers! I want this
Homer J. Simpson fired.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.120
Do you think that's wise?

09:19.190 --> 09:20.690
Think of
the headlines.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.100
Hmm?

09:25.560 --> 09:26.430
Hmm?

09:27.630 --> 09:29.230
Ooh.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.370
What about the headlines?

09:31.430 --> 09:33.830
The press might be
critical of you

09:33.900 --> 09:36.910
for firing the crippled boy's
father so soon after
the accident.

09:36.970 --> 09:38.280
Well, all right then.

09:38.340 --> 09:40.880
I don't want
to seem like an ogre.

09:40.940 --> 09:42.770
I'll bide my time.

09:42.840 --> 09:46.740
Let him twist in the wind
slowly, slowly.

09:46.820 --> 09:51.490
Then, when the papers have found
their new flavor of the month

09:51.550 --> 09:54.080
they'll find out
this cat has <i>claws!</i>

09:54.160 --> 09:56.360
Good thinking, sir.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.350
Mr. Hutz:
Now let's pretend

09:58.430 --> 10:00.100
you're on
the witness stand.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.800
- How are you, Bart?
- Fine.

10:02.860 --> 10:04.660
( pleasantly )
Oh fine, isn't that nice?
Bart says he's fine.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.230
Wrong!
You are <i>not fine!</i>

10:06.300 --> 10:08.070
You're in constant pain!

10:08.140 --> 10:10.470
I am in constant pain.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.410
Dad, may I please make
an observation?

10:12.470 --> 10:13.770
What is it?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.650
I think this is all a charade

10:15.710 --> 10:16.610
<i>to make Bart look more injured</i>

10:16.680 --> 10:17.720
than he really is.

10:17.780 --> 10:20.180
Maybe Lisa does have a point.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.790
I don't mind you boys
doing this in the living room,

10:22.850 --> 10:25.220
but in court, doesn't Bart
have to tell the truth?

10:25.290 --> 10:27.860
Yeah, but what is truth?
If you follow me..

10:27.920 --> 10:32.820
Now Bart, can you roll your eyes
back in your head like this?

10:32.890 --> 10:33.950
You mean like I'm dead?

10:34.030 --> 10:35.270
Yeah, sure.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.200
The kid's a pro.

10:37.270 --> 10:40.870
Springfield Municipal Court
is now in session

10:40.940 --> 10:43.010
Judge Multon presiding.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.510
Your honor, my client
has instructed me

10:45.570 --> 10:47.770
to remind the court how rich
and important he is.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.600
That he is not
like other men.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.580
I should be able to run over
as many kids as I want!

10:52.650 --> 10:53.850
( <i>gasping )</i>

10:55.180 --> 10:56.410
Mr. Burns

10:56.480 --> 10:58.110
I must warn you

10:58.190 --> 11:01.160
that if you continue
to disrupt the court
in this way,

11:01.220 --> 11:03.180
I will have to cite you
for contempt.

11:03.260 --> 11:05.130
You wouldn't dare.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.350
Well, no,
I guess I wouldn't.

11:07.430 --> 11:10.870
Calling Bartholomew J. Simpson
to the stand.

11:10.930 --> 11:13.730
Everyone:
<i>Aw...</i>

11:13.800 --> 11:15.640
Oh, please.

11:15.700 --> 11:16.960
Hello, Bart.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.140
Now you know
the difference

11:19.210 --> 11:22.410
between telling the truth
and telling a lie

11:22.480 --> 11:23.650
don't you, son?

11:23.710 --> 11:25.220
Maybe.

11:25.280 --> 11:28.490
Well, you wouldn't lie
to the United States

11:28.550 --> 11:31.020
would you, Bart?

11:31.090 --> 11:31.690
No.
No.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.480
No.

11:32.550 --> 11:33.510
Good.

11:33.590 --> 11:34.830
Proceed, Mr. Hutz.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.500
Thank you, your honor.
Bart, tell the jury

11:37.560 --> 11:39.230
in your own words

11:39.290 --> 11:42.720
exactly what happened
on the day of the accident.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.270
Yes, sir.

11:44.330 --> 11:47.130
It was a beautiful
Sunday afternoon.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.210
<i>I was playing
in my wholesome, childlike way</i>

11:50.270 --> 11:51.740
<i>little realizing that
I was about to be struck down</i>

11:51.810 --> 11:54.380
<i>by the luxury car of death.</i>

11:57.150 --> 11:58.320
( children screaming )

11:58.380 --> 12:00.050
Defenseless child at 3 o' clock.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.690
( <i>evil laughter )</i>

12:07.390 --> 12:10.190
<i>Luckily, I was not killed
that day</i>

12:10.260 --> 12:14.270
although sometimes,
I wish I had been.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.840
Oh, he's lying.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.840
Now <i>that's
believable testimony.</i>

12:22.900 --> 12:25.470
Hmmm.
Hmmm.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.880
Mr. Burns, would you please
relate in your own words

12:28.940 --> 12:32.740
exactly what <i>really happened
on the day of the accident?</i>

12:32.810 --> 12:35.980
Certainly.
It was a beautiful day.

12:36.050 --> 12:39.760
<i>The sun was shining.
I was driving to the orphanage
to pass out toys.</i>

12:39.820 --> 12:42.660
<i>Suddenly, that incorrigible
Simpson boy</i>

12:42.720 --> 12:44.190
<i>darted in front of me.</i>

12:46.330 --> 12:47.600
( <i>laughing )</i>

12:48.930 --> 12:50.900
Ahh!

12:50.970 --> 12:52.200
Oh, my goodness.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.600
Look what's happened.

12:53.670 --> 12:54.370
It's not important, sir.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.540
Let's drive on.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.770
Why, you despicable,
cold-blooded monster.

12:58.840 --> 13:02.380
Regardless of what you think,
we will summon help
and comfort the dear boy

13:02.440 --> 13:04.310
until an ambulance arrives.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.490
No!

13:08.550 --> 13:10.150
Take me!

13:10.220 --> 13:12.220
I'm old!

13:12.290 --> 13:13.660
That's what happened.

13:17.890 --> 13:18.620
What are you

13:18.690 --> 13:20.190
looking at me like that for?

13:20.260 --> 13:22.100
You believed
<i>his cock-and-bull story.</i>

13:22.160 --> 13:23.790
It's looking good,
Mr. Simpson.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.840
It's looking
very, very good.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.810
They hate <i>me?!</i>

13:28.870 --> 13:30.410
What trial
were you watching?

13:30.470 --> 13:32.080
Maybe a settlement...

13:32.140 --> 13:33.680
Oh, yes,
settlements, fine.

13:33.740 --> 13:36.080
Hang your heads in shame

13:36.140 --> 13:40.140
you over-priced, under-brained,
glorified notary publics!

13:40.220 --> 13:42.290
<i>Just get that big ape
to my house tonight,</i>

13:42.350 --> 13:44.960
<i>and we'll buy him off
with a banana or two.</i>

13:45.020 --> 13:47.630
...and that ugly customer

13:47.690 --> 13:50.630
was the last Indonesian rhino
on Earth.

13:50.690 --> 13:53.460
I didn't know
you liked animals.

13:53.530 --> 13:55.100
Oh, I don't like
everything about them--

13:55.160 --> 13:57.890
just their heads.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.840
Would you care for
some wine, old buddy?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.170
Don't mind if I do.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.310
Go, go.

14:04.370 --> 14:05.600
<i>Bottoms up,
Simpson.</i>

14:05.670 --> 14:06.870
<i>There's plenty more</i>

14:06.940 --> 14:07.810
where that came from.

14:10.110 --> 14:14.690
- Mr. Burns, are you trying
to get me drunk?
-  Yes.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.390
Now then Homer, old chum.
I'm sure you'll agree with me
that this trial

14:17.450 --> 14:19.990
<i>is an affront to our
collective dignity.</i>

14:20.050 --> 14:23.280
What do you say we settle this
man-to-man?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.600
You mean duke it out?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.360
Oh, no.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.330
I mean I'm prepared
to offer you

14:29.400 --> 14:31.200
a most generous
cash settlement.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.740
A princely sum...

14:33.800 --> 14:35.770
well, a handsome sum

14:35.840 --> 14:38.040
that can end
this little imbroglio

14:38.110 --> 14:39.740
once and for all.

14:41.240 --> 14:46.040
$500,000.

14:46.110 --> 14:46.910
Goodness.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.950
Don't answer me now.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.020
Relax, talk it over
with the missus.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.690
Soak in the opulence
of your surroundings

14:54.760 --> 14:56.960
and dream of what might be.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.400
Smithers, let's go
powder my nose.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.470
Well, Marge,
what do you think?

15:01.530 --> 15:04.230
Well I don't know.
Maybe we should
take his money

15:04.300 --> 15:06.840
and put all this ugliness
behind us.

15:06.900 --> 15:10.270
The fish is in the pan.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.580
<i>What do you think, Homer?</i>

15:11.640 --> 15:13.040
I'll tell you what <i>I think.</i>

15:13.110 --> 15:16.010
I think he thinks
I'm an idiot!

15:16.080 --> 15:17.150
The only reason

15:17.210 --> 15:18.580
he's offering us this

15:18.650 --> 15:21.050
is because he knows
he's gonna lose at trial

15:21.120 --> 15:22.950
and have to pay us
a cool million.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.760
Oh! I feel faint.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.990
$500,000!

15:27.060 --> 15:30.690
I spit on
his $500,000!

15:31.590 --> 15:32.490
Hmm.

15:32.560 --> 15:35.630
Homer, what's
happened to you?

15:35.700 --> 15:37.300
All this
greediness and lying

15:37.370 --> 15:39.570
and shifty lawyers
and phony doctors...

15:39.630 --> 15:41.760
Phony doctors? Hello.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.040
Do you know
what I'd settle for,
if it was up to me?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.340
Bart's medical bills
and an apology.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.640
<i>And you won't
even get that.</i>

15:47.710 --> 15:49.450
Sorry. Offer's expired.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.220
I guess we'll just have to
let the jury decide.
12 good men and true.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.180
Good day.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.780
Smithers,
release the hounds.

15:53.850 --> 15:54.690
( <i>snarling )</i>

15:54.750 --> 15:56.520
( <i>barking )</i>

15:58.850 --> 16:00.380
Your honor

16:00.460 --> 16:02.990
I would like to call
to the stand

16:03.060 --> 16:06.030
Mrs. Homer J. Simpson.

16:06.090 --> 16:06.720
( <i>gasping )</i>

16:06.790 --> 16:08.560
( <i>murmuring )</i>

16:10.770 --> 16:12.300
uth

16:12.370 --> 16:16.170
and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.440
Yes, I do.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.640
She sounded like

16:18.710 --> 16:20.180
she was taking that
awful seriously.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.750
Homer:
Oh, the truth.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.850
Mrs. Simpson, does the name
Julius Hibbert

16:25.910 --> 16:27.710
mean anything to you?

16:27.780 --> 16:31.980
Yes, he's been our family
physician and trusted friend

16:32.050 --> 16:34.250
ever since the day
I became a mother.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.690
He's seen us through everything
from colds to impetigo

16:36.760 --> 16:39.030
with competence and loving care.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.520
But wait a minute.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.330
I'm confused.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.440
This court heard
expert testimony

16:44.500 --> 16:48.070
from one Dr. Nick Riviera.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.240
<i>What is your opinion of him?</i>

16:49.300 --> 16:50.430
Mmm.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.840
Mrs. Simpson?

16:51.910 --> 16:53.910
I'm sorry,
but my mother always said

16:53.980 --> 16:56.750
if you can't say anything nice,
don't say anything at all.

16:56.810 --> 16:58.120
Will that hold up in court?

16:58.180 --> 16:59.950
No, I've tried it before.

17:00.010 --> 17:04.010
Mrs. Simpson, what is
your opinion of Dr. Riviera?

17:04.089 --> 17:07.690
And let me remind you
that you're under oath.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.730
Well, to be honest,
he seemed a lot more concerned

17:10.790 --> 17:12.960
about wrapping Bart in bandages

17:13.030 --> 17:14.700
than making him feel better.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.619
He mispronounced
words that I know

17:16.700 --> 17:18.869
like abdomen.

17:18.930 --> 17:21.300
And his office was dirty.

17:21.369 --> 17:24.609
Now that I think about it,
I'm not sure he's even a doctor.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.500
D-ohhh!

17:25.569 --> 17:27.200
And Mrs. Simpson

17:27.280 --> 17:30.410
could you describe for us
in your own words

17:30.480 --> 17:32.450
Bart's intense mental anguish

17:32.510 --> 17:33.710
and suffering?

17:33.780 --> 17:35.920
I don't know
how intense it was.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.210
Uh-huh.

17:37.290 --> 17:40.490
I guess he did miss
three days of school

17:40.560 --> 17:42.830
although he doesn't
really like school

17:42.890 --> 17:45.100
all that much,
so I guess

17:45.160 --> 17:47.100
that may not count
as anguish.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.470
No, it doesn't.

17:48.530 --> 17:49.930
It was a little hard on me

17:50.000 --> 17:52.840
having him around the house
all that time.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.070
Could you put a dollar amount
on all these hardships?

17:56.140 --> 17:59.980
We pay Bart five dollars
a week to take out the trash.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.350
I suppose if he'd been able
to do it that week

18:03.410 --> 18:05.380
we might have given him the $5.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.120
Five dollars?

18:07.180 --> 18:09.650
But your lawyer,
assuming he is a lawyer

18:09.720 --> 18:11.860
is asking for a million.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.290
Well, we can't blame them
for trying, can we?

18:15.360 --> 18:17.590
Thank you very much,
Mrs. Simpson.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.260
( <i>sobbing: )
Oh, Marge!</i>

18:19.330 --> 18:22.430
( <i>sinister laughing )</i>

18:22.500 --> 18:25.370
I'm going to write a figure
on this piece of paper.

18:25.430 --> 18:29.600
It's not quite as large
as the last one

18:29.670 --> 18:31.810
but I think
you'll find it fair.

18:31.870 --> 18:33.670
I think
we should take it.

18:33.740 --> 18:35.550
<i>A million dollars.</i>

18:35.610 --> 18:38.480
<i>My wife cost me
a million dollars.</i>

18:38.550 --> 18:41.220
Homer, would you
like more macaroni and cheese?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.650
<i>A million dollars worth,
you treacherous snake woman.</i>

18:44.720 --> 18:45.560
No, thank you.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.660
Some string beans?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.590
<i>No I don't want any string
beans either, you two-timing
back-stabbing...</i>

18:49.660 --> 18:51.090
<i>Uh-oh, better answer.</i>

18:51.160 --> 18:52.360
No, thank you.

18:52.430 --> 18:53.960
Some celery with
cream cheese on it?

18:54.030 --> 18:55.800
<i>Just mouth polite nothings.</i>

18:55.860 --> 18:57.120
No, thank you.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.470
You know what would have
really been cool?

18:58.530 --> 19:00.160
If we got that million bucks.

19:00.230 --> 19:01.860
Bart, please.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.540
What?
We could have bought tons
of great stuff, Mom.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.640
Maids, a pool, fancy sweaters--

19:06.710 --> 19:08.080
Stop me if I'm wrong.

19:08.140 --> 19:09.870
Marge, dear

19:09.940 --> 19:11.510
would it be alright if
I went over to Moe's
for a drink?

19:11.580 --> 19:12.750
Why, sure.

19:12.810 --> 19:13.640
<i>(thinking)
I don't know</i>

19:13.710 --> 19:15.340
<i>if I'll ever come back here.</i>

19:15.420 --> 19:16.890
Good night.

19:16.950 --> 19:19.890
<i>My woman's intuition
is telling me something.</i>

19:19.950 --> 19:21.180
( <i>door closes )</i>

19:21.260 --> 19:22.430
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:25.190 --> 19:26.550
Well, that's it.

19:26.630 --> 19:29.100
I guess this is the glass
I'm gonna die in.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.420
You're better off.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.070
Rich people aren't happy.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.400
From the day they're born
till the day they die

19:35.470 --> 19:38.040
they think they're happy,
but trust me, they ain't.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.280
<i>Moe. I wish he'd shut up.</i>

19:41.710 --> 19:43.210
Hey. Hubba-hubba.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.820
Yow!
A chick!

19:44.880 --> 19:47.150
And it's not even ladies night.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.650
Hey, hey, guys.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.120
Knock it off.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.510
It's just my wife.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.660
Well, hello.

19:52.720 --> 19:53.660
Va-va-voom.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.130
My name is Marge.

19:55.190 --> 19:58.460
Homer, I'd like you
to forgive me

19:58.530 --> 20:01.030
for doing the right thing.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.470
Oh, Marge.

20:02.530 --> 20:06.440
We've squabbled
over money before.
Never this much.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.240
I know this is different
than that time

20:08.300 --> 20:10.660
I washed your pants
with the 20 in the pocket.

20:10.740 --> 20:11.980
No, no, no.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.140
You think this is about money?

20:14.210 --> 20:15.480
Well, it's not.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.970
It's worse, Marge.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.140
I'm afraid that from now on,
when I look at you

20:20.210 --> 20:22.780
I'm not gonna see
the wife by my side

20:22.850 --> 20:25.560
or the mother of my children.

20:25.620 --> 20:29.160
I'm just gonna see the dame
who blew my one big chance.

20:29.220 --> 20:32.620
- What are you saying, Homer?
- I'm saying..

20:32.690 --> 20:34.690
<i>She's been your wife
for ten years.</i>

20:34.760 --> 20:36.660
<i>You've had
three children together.</i>

20:36.730 --> 20:37.530
<i>It's time to be honest
with her.</i>

20:37.600 --> 20:38.870
I'm not sure

20:38.930 --> 20:40.290
I love you anymore.

20:40.370 --> 20:41.240
( <i>gasps )</i>

20:41.300 --> 20:42.570
But don't worry.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.170
I'll never let on.

20:44.240 --> 20:45.780
I'll still do
all the bed stuff.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.940
Maybe it won't be so bad.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.980
Oh, my Lord!

20:49.040 --> 20:51.640
I don't want to wait
another minute to find out

20:51.710 --> 20:53.710
whether you
love me anymore.

20:53.780 --> 20:57.990
<i>I think that you should
look me in the eyes
and find out.</i>

20:58.050 --> 20:59.310
No.

20:59.390 --> 21:02.160
Homer, look at me.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.080
<i>Shut her up.</i>

21:04.160 --> 21:05.530
<i>Start with the feet.</i>

21:05.590 --> 21:06.850
<i>Still angry.</i>

21:06.930 --> 21:08.530
<i>Good. Good, Homer. Good.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:09.870
<i>This is tough.</i>

21:09.930 --> 21:11.370
<i>Need refreshment.</i>

21:11.430 --> 21:13.330
<i>Ah, good old trustworthy beer.</i>

21:13.400 --> 21:15.940
<i>My love for you will never die.</i>

21:16.000 --> 21:17.660
<i>Got to look at the wife
straight in the eyes</i>

21:17.740 --> 21:19.580
<i>and tell her...</i>

21:24.850 --> 21:26.820
Oh, who am I kidding?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.120
I love you more than ever.

21:29.180 --> 21:30.510
I love you too.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.390
Sorry to scare you
like that, babe.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.330
Okay, everybody.

21:36.390 --> 21:40.600
For the next 15 minutes,
one-third off on every pitcher.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.930
( <i>cheering )</i>

21:43.000 --> 21:45.440
Moe:
<i>Hey, one per customer.</i>

21:45.500 --> 21:47.340
<i>Domestic beer only.</i>

21:47.400 --> 21:48.910
<i>Hey, no sharing.</i>

21:54.540 --> 21:58.010
