04:00.411 --> 04:01.806
- I was drunk.
- Oh.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.794

04:44.453 --> 04:46.714
No, Amy's terrified of rodents.

04:46.716 --> 04:48.350
She calls Mickey Mouse "The Great Satan."

04:48.352 --> 04:50.770

should be involved in this.

04:50.772 --> 04:53.054

No, no sides. You're both my friends.

05:00.288 --> 05:02.210
Well, if she's such a great friend,

05:02.212 --> 05:05.208
then why did she tell me you
can't really pull off a loose tank?

05:05.210 --> 05:07.103
- What?
- Her words, not mine.

05:07.105 --> 05:10.106

She loved Duke.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.675

05:23.677 --> 05:25.305

05:25.307 --> 05:26.890
guys who are less intelligent than you

05:26.892 --> 05:28.559
because you can't bear to be challenged,

05:28.561 --> 05:30.072
probably stemming from... what was it?...

05:30.074 --> 05:31.328
low self-esteem issues.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.396
See, this is exactly why I

06:32.066 --> 06:33.124

Ex-girlfriend, and Karma didn't kiss Zita.

Zita kissed her.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.628
Wait, what?

06:39.630 --> 06:40.876
Yeah, Zita was trying to make me jealous,

06:40.878 --> 06:45.034

- Zita really did kiss Karma.
- So what?

07:02.950 --> 07:04.719
That doesn't explain why
Karma kissed you in the pool.

07:04.721 --> 07:07.672
Since I don't have those feelings for
Karma anymore, why should it matter?

07:07.674 --> 07:09.656
I just want to end this stupid fight.

07:09.658 --> 07:11.226

- Give it to Tonya.
- Okay.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.075
You told me that video didn't faze you,

08:23.077 --> 08:25.246
but then you leaked Amy's
journal to the whole school?

08:25.248 --> 08:26.511
I know it looks bad.

08:26.513 --> 08:28.212
It looks like you've been lying to me.

08:28.214 --> 08:30.114
All summer, I thought
we were really connected.

08:30.116 --> 08:31.482
I thought you were like me...

08:31.484 --> 08:32.984
chill, drama-free.

08:32.986 --> 08:36.119
I was. I am.

08:36.121 --> 08:37.416
You know the real me.

08:37.418 --> 08:39.785
Amy's the one that came back
and started picking these fights.

08:39.788 --> 08:41.778
She's the one trying to drag me down.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.494
Sounds like a bunch of excuses.

08:43.496 --> 08:45.150
No, that's not it at all.

08:45.152 --> 08:47.031
I'm just trying to explain
my side of the story.

08:47.033 --> 08:48.788
[gong blares]

08:48.790 --> 08:51.789
I got to go work on my
sustainability project.

08:54.302 --> 08:55.667
[sighs]

08:59.853 --> 09:00.845
What are you doing?

09:00.847 --> 09:04.665
Collecting Amy's journal pages
to spare her further humiliation.

09:04.667 --> 09:05.722
Isn't that what you're doing?

09:05.724 --> 09:07.590
Totally, and while we're both helping her,

09:07.592 --> 09:09.087
why don't you give me a
peek at the pages about me,

09:09.089 --> 09:10.555
and I'll give you a peek
at the pages about you?

09:10.557 --> 09:11.439
[gasps] What?

09:11.441 --> 09:14.290
I'm not reading them. That's a
total violation of her privacy.

09:14.292 --> 09:17.816
Hmm, well, then I guess
you aren't interested

09:17.818 --> 09:20.492
in Amy's analysis of your daddy issues.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.567
Please. Amy didn't write about that.

09:22.569 --> 09:24.502
Or did she, Show Pony?

09:24.504 --> 09:27.310
[gasps]

09:27.312 --> 09:28.529
We never tell Amy we did this?

09:28.531 --> 09:29.629
Deal.

09:31.420 --> 09:32.804
Once we get to the blow torch,

09:32.806 --> 09:35.113
we'll solder together
the old circuit boards.

09:35.115 --> 09:37.858
Great, we're setting
busted electronics on fire.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.834
- Sounds safe.
- I think you're right.

09:39.836 --> 09:41.886
Your left boob <i>is</i>
bigger than your right.

09:41.888 --> 09:45.110
[sighs] Don't you have a
subreddit to troll, Glen?

09:45.112 --> 09:46.325
[bleep], Karma.

09:46.327 --> 09:47.072
Well, hold on. Hold on.

09:47.074 --> 09:50.039
To be fair, she was just trying to
humiliate you the way you humiliated her.

09:50.041 --> 09:53.446
Of course you're defending her,
because you still have a thing for her.

09:53.448 --> 09:56.926
Okay, see, you're just projecting onto me
because you still have feelings for her.

09:56.928 --> 09:57.902
I do not.

09:57.904 --> 09:59.837
In fact, Karma's dead to me.

09:59.839 --> 10:02.340
I don't give a [bleep]
what happens to her anymore.

10:14.574 --> 10:16.374
How soon can we do this?

10:16.376 --> 10:17.955
I'll have my team start lighting.

10:17.957 --> 10:19.323
Perfect.

10:21.984 --> 10:22.705
[gasps]

10:22.707 --> 10:24.548
She did think Duke was dumb!

10:24.550 --> 10:26.598
Look, "Sometimes I wonder
if Shane actively looks

10:26.600 --> 10:28.766
for guys who won't challenge him."

10:28.768 --> 10:30.501
That is crazy...

10:30.503 --> 10:31.702
accurate.

10:31.704 --> 10:35.740
Yeah, and you dated Tommy
for the deep conversations.

10:35.742 --> 10:37.902
- What, what does it say?
- Nothing.

10:37.904 --> 10:41.748
"I wish Lauren didn't need Twitter
followers to feel validated."

10:41.750 --> 10:44.182
[laughs] She nailed you!

10:44.184 --> 10:48.152
You're just jealous that I
have followers to validate me.

10:48.154 --> 10:50.060
Oh, look, this is when we outed Theo.

10:50.062 --> 10:51.619

10:54.728 --> 10:55.726
What?

10:55.728 --> 10:58.436
"But what Shane and Lauren don't know"...

10:58.438 --> 10:59.901
Is?

11:02.134 --> 11:04.235
I don't have the next page.

11:04.237 --> 11:05.898
Do you have 172?

11:07.504 --> 11:09.861
We have got to find that page.

11:10.732 --> 11:12.883
Dylan is cheating on her.
Someone has to tell Karma.

11:12.885 --> 11:15.330
Mm-mm, not my friend, not my problem.

11:15.332 --> 11:16.581
- You tell her.
- No, I can't.

11:16.583 --> 11:18.249
She'll just think that I'm
trying to break them up.

11:18.251 --> 11:20.202
- Aren't you?
- No.

11:20.204 --> 11:23.899
But you're right; the
messenger always gets shot.

11:23.901 --> 11:25.941
Karma over PA system: <i>I want to
apologize to everyone involved.</i>

11:25.943 --> 11:28.149
<i>I feel terrible about my actions.</i>

11:28.151 --> 11:30.693
<i>Having recently been
humiliated myself,</i>

11:30.695 --> 11:33.608
I understand how painful it can be.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.094
Take us through what happened.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.135
Details aren't really important.

11:37.137 --> 11:38.682
What I most want people to know is,

11:38.684 --> 11:42.294
I'm still that relaxed, carefree girl

11:42.296 --> 11:44.575
you all came to know and love this summer.

11:44.577 --> 11:46.143
Today was just a blip,

11:46.145 --> 11:47.245
an aberration.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.332
But I'm all good now.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.397
This is pathetic. She's
doing this all for Dylan.

11:51.399 --> 11:54.673
I can't believe she's
chasing after that douchebag.

11:54.675 --> 11:55.774
You should probably tell her.

11:55.776 --> 11:58.523
What? No, you just said the
messenger always gets shot.

11:58.525 --> 12:01.058
Yeah, they do, but if
you're over her, who cares?

12:01.060 --> 12:02.277
Well, I thought by not telling her,

12:02.279 --> 12:03.190
it would show that I was over her.

12:03.192 --> 12:06.203
Actually, not telling her would mean
that you are worried about her reaction

12:06.205 --> 12:08.181
because you still hope to be with
her because you're in love with her.

12:08.183 --> 12:09.598
[laughs] Which I am not.

12:09.600 --> 12:10.806
So it's settled. You'll tell her.

12:10.808 --> 12:13.111
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

12:13.113 --> 12:14.865
Bye.

Vashti: <i>I see you've
located some pages</i>

12:16.609 --> 12:18.524
about you in Amy's journal.

12:18.526 --> 12:19.555
Have you read them?

12:19.557 --> 12:22.014
No, that would be a
violation of her privacy.

12:22.016 --> 12:23.481
You leaked them to the whole school.

12:23.483 --> 12:26.031
Again, a crime of passion.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.485
Regrettable, sure,

12:27.487 --> 12:30.342
but also completely
understandable and relatable

12:30.344 --> 12:32.823
and not a sign of my
chill character changing.

12:32.825 --> 12:33.956
Vashti: <i>In her journal,</i>

12:33.958 --> 12:36.210
Amy has some questions,

12:36.212 --> 12:38.347
and, quite frankly, so do I.

12:38.349 --> 12:41.783
Deep down, do you have feelings for her?

12:41.785 --> 12:42.833
Karma: <i>[laughs]</i>

12:42.835 --> 12:44.511
No, I don't.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.950

12:45.952 --> 12:47.181
But I'm straight.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.307
Vashti: <i>Uh-huh, but is it possible</i>

12:49.309 --> 12:50.866
<i>you're not as straight as you claim?</i>

12:50.868 --> 12:52.123
Excuse me?

12:52.125 --> 12:55.012
Well, you did kiss Zita

12:55.014 --> 12:56.459

12:56.461 --> 12:58.592

12:58.594 --> 12:59.929
<i>as I've explained</i>

But I am not here to make excuses.

13:04.763 --> 13:07.391
I am here to tell my side of the story.

13:07.393 --> 13:10.458
But that's just it. Your
story doesn't add up.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.729
You insist you're straight,

13:11.731 --> 13:14.072
<i>but there's a clear pattern
of you kissing girls.</i>

13:14.074 --> 13:15.289
<i>You can see why people would...</i>

13:15.291 --> 13:18.127
Okay, I've had just about
enough of these gotcha questions,

13:18.129 --> 13:20.162
so this interview is over.

13:23.264 --> 13:24.952
You have to really turn over the compost

13:24.954 --> 13:27.517
so the rotting matter gets to the top.

13:27.519 --> 13:28.366
Great.

Hey.

I, uh...

13:34.835 --> 13:36.011
I saw your interview.

13:36.013 --> 13:38.223
You mean the ambush by
the mainstream media?

13:38.225 --> 13:41.526
Well, it kind of seems like you
were doing it just for Dylan.

13:41.528 --> 13:44.533
Well, that's really none of your business.

13:44.535 --> 13:46.546
Look.

13:46.548 --> 13:50.586
I'm worried that Dylan might
not be the right guy for you.

13:50.588 --> 13:54.821
Excuse me, but did I ask for
your opinion on my relationship?

13:54.823 --> 13:57.609
What are the chances my ex-boyfriend
doesn't like my new boyfriend?

13:57.611 --> 13:59.256
'Cause you're so unbiased, right?

13:59.258 --> 14:00.679
I am not biased.

14:00.681 --> 14:02.084

14:02.086 --> 14:04.650
Yay! I love everyone being over me.

Look, I've had a really horrible day,

14:09.479 --> 14:12.834
and I don't think I can handle
anything making it worse.

14:15.358 --> 14:17.563
That's the last thing I want to do.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.525
Great.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.123
So we're done here?

That's me.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.719

14:35.721 --> 14:36.792
Yeah, I've got the goods.

14:46.311 --> 14:48.495
This is high-quality stuff.

14:48.497 --> 14:51.047
I'm not just gonna hand it over.

14:51.049 --> 14:52.656

if you're gonna screw around,

why don't you just break up with her?

17:33.574 --> 17:36.363
and then just assume she's
the worst person in the world

17:36.365 --> 17:39.641
after she forgave you for
sleeping with her ex-boyfriend,

17:39.643 --> 17:42.438
because that's what you did!

17:42.440 --> 17:46.703
That is because you forced me
to kiss you over and over again,

17:46.705 --> 17:48.551
and then you rejected me.

17:48.553 --> 17:49.847
Because I'm straight!

17:49.849 --> 17:51.220
Oh! Are you sure about that?

17:51.222 --> 17:56.043
Because you had a real hard time
answering Vashti's questions.

17:56.045 --> 17:58.060
- Amy...
- No, come on. Admit it.

17:58.062 --> 17:59.495
Either you're playing mind games,

17:59.497 --> 18:02.624
or there's a small part of
you that wanted to kiss me.

18:02.626 --> 18:04.404
- Amy, stop.
- No, I want answers!

18:04.406 --> 18:06.277
Amy, stop! There's a rat in there.

18:06.279 --> 18:08.484
Ew, a rat. [shrieking]

18:09.650 --> 18:10.967
- Okay!
- Trap it! Trap it! Trap it!

18:10.969 --> 18:12.840
I'm trying. You have to get off my back.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.190
Oh. Ooh.

18:16.192 --> 18:17.453
[both exclaim]

18:19.137 --> 18:21.784
[both breathing heavily]

18:21.786 --> 18:23.664
Oh, sweet Bloody Mary.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.329
You saved me from the rat.

18:36.331 --> 18:37.355
I saved myself.

18:37.357 --> 18:39.157
I don't exactly love them.

18:44.252 --> 18:46.853
Liam told me that you didn't kiss Zita.

18:48.167 --> 18:49.367
I really didn't.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.084
[sighs]

18:55.086 --> 18:59.977
You know, I had to ask myself

18:59.979 --> 19:01.918
if I evolved,

19:01.920 --> 19:04.660
then why did it hurt so
bad to see you kiss her?

19:04.662 --> 19:07.263
<i>♪ When you gonna live
your life right? ♪</i>

19:07.265 --> 19:09.539
