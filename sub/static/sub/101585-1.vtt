M_I_SForEver

01:16.043 --> 01:17.910
It's my place actually.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.912
I prepared this entire
exhibition.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.814
Thank you for the invitation.

01:23.751 --> 01:24.883
Excuse me, I...

01:24.885 --> 01:27.219
I really love this sculpture.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.533
I'm sorry, I think
I know this woman.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.257
I wondered...

03:12.259 --> 03:15.494
If I found my way to
a quiet little room...

03:17.064 --> 03:19.731
Away from the noisy crowd...

03:20.568 --> 03:22.467
Would he follow me?

03:23.571 --> 03:25.737
How did the experiment go?

03:26.941 --> 03:30.108
I'll tell you when it's over.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.793
Are you comfortable, my darling?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.428
I'm in heaven.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.997
Are you sure this is the
right address?

03:52.132 --> 03:54.766
66 Ruling Class Lane.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.368
Are you here for the concert?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.569
We're Bright Blue Gorilla.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.004
We love you guys!

03:59.773 --> 04:00.806
Where do we set up?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.608
Over there, by the
molten lava.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.751

05:11.445 --> 05:13.845
Some other time.

06:47.875 --> 06:52.411
Gaze upon the past and you
gaze upon the future.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.913
I can see myself in this plate!

06:54.915 --> 06:56.314
And this glass.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.749
And the silver.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.385
You've discovered some way to
make dishes shine.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.288
After the commercial.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.099
Can it be stopped?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.135
It's the effect of a cause:
Greed and selfishness.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.470
Can it be slowed?

07:18.472 --> 07:19.938
It has to happen.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.907
Slowed until wisdom takes hold?

07:21.909 --> 07:25.644
You will be summoned
to that task.

07:26.447 --> 07:31.049
Maxwell House coffee tastes as
good as it smells, every time.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.024
Let's take a break.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.664
That's the new girl.

07:47.701 --> 07:50.035
What is the essence of this
training?

07:50.037 --> 07:52.871
To avoid and disable,
to move undetected,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.873
to be informed through
intuition.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.374
You have Albinism.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.676
Yes I do.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.611
It's difficult to hold my eyes
and head still,

07:59.613 --> 08:01.279
and sunlight burns me.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.981
Other than that, I'm amazing.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.516
Where is the intuition?

08:04.518 --> 08:06.785
Just beyond the mind,
in the Real Self.

08:06.787 --> 08:09.187
And how do you reach the
Real Self?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.889
Through deep meditation.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.257
You answer well.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.625
Gina...

08:13.627 --> 08:15.126
Have them tune-in for a while.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.362
Let's focus everybody.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.132
I'll be back tomorrow night.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.739
That was quick.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.541
Triplets.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.910
Sons of a missionary
in Beijing.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.946
Their only regret is that
they're not Asian.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.616
Criminals actually.
They call their gang "Sen Sen".

09:11.618 --> 09:13.084
Catchy isn't it?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.386
Are you enjoying yourself?

09:14.388 --> 09:15.754
Always.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.623
That's a nice technique.
Are they dead?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.358
They'll wake up in half an hour.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.327
That gives us time to chat.

09:22.529 --> 09:23.695
How long has it been?

09:23.697 --> 09:24.863
Not long enough.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.531
You're still mad about that?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.732
How's the shoulder?

09:27.734 --> 09:28.800
What do you want?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.468
World War 3 is here.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.038
But it's early yet so most
people haven't noticed.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.574
Cyber attacks, updated
weapons systems,

09:35.576 --> 09:38.410
political puppets in place,
it's all prologue.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.045
The show is on.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.146
What's your point?

09:42.148 --> 09:44.248
I want you to form a new agency,
strictly off the books.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.118
Sabotage, confuse,
throw their plans off.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.955
Americans are worthless at
the moment and...

09:49.957 --> 09:52.290
British spies are only good
in the movies.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.459
Give us time to know who
to trust.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.395
I need time.
You can get it for me.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.068
That technique is impressive.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.904
But don't get over confident...

10:13.547 --> 10:16.247
You and this...
It's all so perfect.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.750
How did you know meatloaf
was my favorite?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.518
I just had a feeling.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.187
I'm so sorry about last night.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.254
You were tired.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.056
I don't even remember going
to bed.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.761
You've got good reflexes!

10:29.763 --> 10:31.396
I used to play tennis.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.772
I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.374
I know you will.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.510
Not very romantic toasting with
water, but after last night...

10:46.179 --> 10:47.545
It's perfect.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.381
To us.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.317
The meatloaf is getting cold.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.818
Silly me! Going on and on...

10:53.820 --> 10:56.287
when you've been slaving over
a hot stove all day.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.730
There's something in this.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.467
Something wonderful!
What spice is that?

11:09.469 --> 11:11.302
Family secret!

12:02.389 --> 12:04.089
Nice clips.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.924
It's in his profile.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.160
The guards work the floors in
9 minute intervals.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.596
There's only one camera we need
to worry about...

12:11.598 --> 12:13.665
just behind the door.

13:38.518 --> 13:39.684
What took so long?

13:39.686 --> 13:41.719
I couldn't get him out.
I had to use gas.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.621
We have to work on that.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.890
Are you sure this is right?
There's nothing here.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.026
That's why I 'm sure.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.466
3, 2, 1.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.870
What does it mean?

13:58.872 --> 14:00.471
We're either too early or
too late.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.307
You'd better get
back to your husband...

14:02.309 --> 14:03.842
before he wakes up.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.410
We have to try again tomorrow.

14:05.412 --> 14:08.246
When they find the guard
they'll lock down the place.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.588
Knock out a
skinny guy next time.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.432
They'll be here in two minutes.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.433
Poor guy.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.435
He'll wake up in the tropics.
Not so bad.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.569
He'll get fired.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.104
He'll find another job.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.242
I put $100 in his pocket.

14:37.244 --> 14:39.777
I hope they pick him up
before he's mugged.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.448
Robyn, sweetheart!

14:43.450 --> 14:44.849
Have I got a gig for you!

14:44.851 --> 14:46.217
We got a gig!

14:46.219 --> 14:47.986
Hope it's not in
hell this time.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.088
Quick question:

14:50.090 --> 14:53.091
Could you play guitar wearing
a contamination suit?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.260
Probably, if the gloves
are thin.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.529
There was a tiny little spill at
the nuclear power plant and...

14:58.531 --> 15:01.766
they thought some music would
cheer up the cleaning crew.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.908

15:17.117 --> 15:18.449

15:42.976 --> 15:43.875
What?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.010
Are you enjoying?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.645
Oh, yes.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.580
What a crowd!

15:52.485 --> 15:53.952
It's getting a bit late and...

15:53.954 --> 15:56.054
Darling, after last night...

15:56.256 --> 15:57.455
You were tired.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.557
I just don't understand what's
happening to me.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.026
Look, let's forget all that.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.494
It's forgotten.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.930
You are divine!

16:07.300 --> 16:08.833
I know I told you I wanted to
come here...

16:08.835 --> 16:10.768
even though I said
I can't dance.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.503
Maybe we should head home...

16:12.505 --> 16:13.771
About the dancing.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.506
About not being able to dance...

16:16.176 --> 16:17.842
I want you to know...

16:18.478 --> 16:19.544
What?

16:19.546 --> 16:23.448
I lied! I won a national dance
contest a few years ago!

17:24.344 --> 17:25.843
What happened?

17:25.845 --> 17:28.012
He won a dance contest.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.182
I'll explain later.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.032
Now the missile will detonate
on the launch pad.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.033
Exactly.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.309
Nothing personal.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.615
We can't leave him.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.856
How many guards do they need?

18:17.964 --> 18:19.464
Hey man, are you all right?

18:23.970 --> 18:26.370
Hey, Karate Kid.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.908
We've got to work on
your skills.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.076
I know.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.544
Grab a foot.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.620
Three guards disappearing
in two days.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.922
They'll know something happened
but they won't know what.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.893
Bon voyage.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.198
Hello, Mama!

19:29.068 --> 19:30.468
Are you okay?

19:30.803 --> 19:33.938
I'm going to the drugstore.
I'll be right back.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.991
Be green, be green, be green...

19:55.528 --> 19:57.295
No, no, no!

19:59.666 --> 20:01.632
Thank you, thank you!

20:03.736 --> 20:04.902
Prepare.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.006
When you're ready, put Gina out.
She won't resist.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.946
Sorry. Reflexes.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.480
Again.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.954
That didn't work.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.922
It did hurt though.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.191
It's not force, it's intention.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.027
Stop thinking of yourself as
a body.

20:30.029 --> 20:33.564
You are consciousness and
energy, residing in a body.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.700
Watch. No force at all.

20:42.542 --> 20:45.209
Wow. That was like an
electric shock.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.210
It was.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.912
The body is filled with energy.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.615
If you go deep enough you'll
learn how to move it.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.216
Meditate more.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.851
One minute to broadcast.

20:55.154 --> 20:57.989
Now I've got a headache.

They won't come if they're
only background.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.571
Give 'em some lines.
Just a couple of lines.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.606
All right you win! Okay?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.342
I've got a juicy role for both
of them, send them over.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.147
Tell Joe I found 2 stunt people
to fall off that building.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.760
Not a soul.

21:35.762 --> 21:39.363
Just some fruit, coconut,
and fresh water.

21:40.199 --> 21:42.600
Well somebody put these here!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.581
These are yours.

21:58.017 --> 21:58.983
Wow.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.318
He owns a sheep station.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.819
He's, like, 70.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.888
52 and you fit his profile.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.390
That's a hard 52.

22:06.392 --> 22:07.825
What do we want with him?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.427
Just read the file.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.063
I've seen him before.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.164
Yes you have.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.799
He's with MI6.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.000
On loan to us.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.902
Doesn't fight well but he's
fairly smart.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.303
He thinks he's James Bond.

22:19.639 --> 22:20.905
Don't they all?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.307
Please read the files.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.410
There's a lot to memorize and
we leave in 4 hours.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.715
Okay guys, I need you in
10 minutes.

22:31.184 --> 22:32.383
Okay.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.152
Does this make any sense to you?

22:35.154 --> 22:36.320

22:36.522 --> 22:37.755
Yeah, I don't get it.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.056
We've got to talk to the
writers.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.725
They're getting weirder and
weirder.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.560
Maybe it's drugs.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.063
<i>♪ Love came...</i>

22:46.065 --> 22:49.667
<i>♪ like a cooling
zephyr...</i>

22:49.669 --> 22:52.269
<i>♪ and fled...</i>

22:52.271 --> 22:55.873
<i>♪ like I was
a leper...</i>

22:55.875 --> 22:58.609
<i>♪ and now...</i>

22:58.611 --> 23:02.346
<i>♪ I am alone...</i>

23:02.348 --> 23:05.449
<i>♪ completely
alone...</i>

23:07.053 --> 23:10.654
<i>♪ really,
really alone...</i>

23:12.191 --> 23:15.760
<i>♪ ba da da
dah dah...♪♪</i>

23:33.112 --> 23:35.279
We just need a 4 second pulse.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.081
That's enough to change
trajectory.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.049
The chief of the company, he...

23:39.051 --> 23:40.584
Now, that's interesting.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.552
Uh oh.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.253
Uh huh.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.221
Don't run out of gas.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.456
Tank is full.

23:45.458 --> 23:46.891
Why such an old car?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.726
She's touchy about her car.

23:48.728 --> 23:50.161
Carburetor.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.729
Fuel filter.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.731
Not good to be out here in
the wild.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.901
Australia has over 30 types of
venomous spiders and snakes.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.936
How far to the telescope?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.237
About half an hour.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.573
I think you're right.
It's the carburetor.

24:03.176 --> 24:04.341
Maybe it'll clear.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.845
Or maybe not.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.485
I think the fuel line has a
crack.

24:14.487 --> 24:16.153
Do you see any gas
dripping?

24:16.155 --> 24:18.422
Lots of oil but no gas.

24:18.424 --> 24:19.957
Oil pan gasket needs
replacing.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.358
How's the fuel line
look?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.927
It's got a hairline
crack.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.262
There's a slow drip by the
fuel tank.

24:25.264 --> 24:26.797
See if you can tape it up.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.399
Hand me the
screwdriver.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.269
Not the Philips,
the slot.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.309
Maybe we should
move the car...

24:38.311 --> 24:39.376
away from
these bushes.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.946
There could be anything
crawling around out here.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.881
Uh huh. We'll do that.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.883
Snake! Snake!

24:47.653 --> 24:49.153
It's not poisonous.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.654
Well it looked poisonous.

24:50.656 --> 24:52.890
Make yourself useful and turn
the ignition.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.758
Don't start it until I tell you.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.196
You guys clear down there?

24:59.198 --> 25:01.131
Clear.

25:01.501 --> 25:02.600
Go ahead!

25:13.646 --> 25:15.412
Be sure to get it all.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.381
Dirty motor oil is highly
carcinogenic.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.816
Thanks for the tip.

25:19.252 --> 25:21.018
I hope you didn't swallow any.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.487
That could lead to mutating
stomach tissue.

25:23.489 --> 25:24.722
It's a fact.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.891
They studied the effect of
several grades of...

25:26.893 --> 25:28.726
dirty engine oil on
laboratory rats...

25:28.728 --> 25:31.262
and they all developed
terminal lymph...

25:31.264 --> 25:34.098
Just stand here and
don't say anything.

25:34.567 --> 25:35.900
It's not so bad.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.401
Your car...

25:37.403 --> 25:38.736
Don't.

25:39.539 --> 25:42.006
I love your car. And I look
pathetic.

25:42.008 --> 25:45.075
The ranch is 2
kilometers north by northwest.

25:45.077 --> 25:48.345
If you don't make contact or if
there's any trouble just signal.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.548
Otherwise we rendezvous
as planned.

25:50.550 --> 25:51.515
Okay.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.050
Finishing touch.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.252
Nice one. And practical.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.788
Australian sun can cause
all types of...

25:59.225 --> 26:01.792
"Once more unto the breach,
dear friends."

26:03.095 --> 26:04.662
I've got everything.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.730
We'll stash it on the way.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.299
Are you ready to earn your keep?

26:08.301 --> 26:09.800
Yes, ma'am, I am.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.371
Why suffer?

26:14.373 --> 26:15.306
Just tell us.

26:15.308 --> 26:16.574
Tell us what you know.

26:16.576 --> 26:17.608
And we'll let you go.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.010
I don't know. I don't know.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.046
Shall I push the button again?

26:22.048 --> 26:22.980
No!

26:22.982 --> 26:26.517
Please! No more! I beg you!

26:27.453 --> 26:28.452
Save yourself.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.453
Tell us what you know.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.989
I told you, I don't know
anything.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.157
And I...

26:33.459 --> 26:35.192
don't believe you!

26:41.233 --> 26:42.466
Catchy, isn't it?

27:03.289 --> 27:04.355
Hi there!

27:05.024 --> 27:06.190
Sorry to bother you.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.925
I'm a little lost.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.129
It's a type of star
that pulses...

27:12.131 --> 27:14.398
brighter, dimmer,
over days or weeks.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.701
Discovered over 100 years ago by
Henrietta Leavitt.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.637
She must have been
extraordinary.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.804
And determined.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.707
How many astronomers use
your telescope?

27:23.709 --> 27:27.444
About 400 each year,
representing about 20 countries.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.712
Fascinating.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.047
Well the interesting thing is...

27:40.192 --> 27:42.126
<i>We think it's unit 2. Over.</i>

27:42.128 --> 27:43.894
I'm on my way. Over.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.763
<i>Copy that. Tell us what you
find.</i>

27:49.902 --> 27:51.402
Control, I'm at Unit 2.

27:51.404 --> 27:54.304
I see some loose cables but it's
hard to tell from down here.

27:54.306 --> 27:57.141
I'll climb up after lunch and
have a look then. Over.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.976
<i>Copy that. Bon appetite.</i>

28:01.681 --> 28:03.147
That's where I left it!

28:06.585 --> 28:09.586
We have a reciprocal access
policy with several nations.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.395
Hey, look at this.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.766
Canberra just sent a pulse to
one of our satellites.

28:23.169 --> 28:25.002
It's encrypted.
It can't be right.

28:27.606 --> 28:28.672
Wait.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.641
It just stopped.

28:32.445 --> 28:33.444
Should we report?

28:33.446 --> 28:34.778
No. It's a glitch.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.747
Canberra doesn't encrypt.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.151
It's not a question of "if",
it's a question of degree.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.087
Quite impressive.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.088
Amazing place.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.122
Glad to hear that.

28:45.124 --> 28:48.392
The professor's invited us to
a get-together...

28:48.394 --> 28:50.094
he's having Thursday evening.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.095
Very kind of you.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.696
A little gathering at my
vineyard.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.799
Scientists, diplomats, and other
questionable characters.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.368
"And on the 7th day he took her
shopping."

28:58.370 --> 29:00.037
I'll take you if you take me.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.105
Come as you are.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.006
In this? Not a chance.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.975
I look forward to seeing
you there.

29:05.711 --> 29:06.877
I wouldn't miss it.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.446
Wonderful. Now, if you'll
excuse me,

29:09.448 --> 29:11.615
there's a technical matter that
needs my attention.

29:11.617 --> 29:12.649
Of course.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.151
See you Thursday!

29:14.620 --> 29:15.619
Everything good?

29:15.621 --> 29:16.587
Perfect.

29:16.589 --> 29:17.821
Back to town then?

29:18.724 --> 29:20.491
I'll catch up with you later.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.159
There's someone I want to see.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.129
Ah! There it is.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.397
Please. No more. My feet hurt.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.166
What kind of agent are you?

29:29.168 --> 29:30.901
This is where the training
kicks in.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.636
I was trained to think for
myself.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.239
I'm sitting this one out.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.173
Okay then.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.108
Mama will bring you an
ice cream.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.476
Take your time, mama.

29:44.517 --> 29:46.316
Doing a little shopping are we,
darling?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.118
Sorry. I'm taking up all the
room.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.553
Nice perfume you're wearing.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.522
It's this one, one of the boxes.

29:51.524 --> 29:52.523
Pretty strong.

29:52.525 --> 29:53.924
You may be pretty...

29:53.926 --> 29:55.459
but I wouldn't call you strong.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.160
Hey!

29:56.662 --> 29:57.694
Come on.

29:57.696 --> 29:58.996
He just wants to
have a look.

29:58.998 --> 30:00.531
There's no harm in that,
is there, darling?

30:00.533 --> 30:01.765
It's a little gaudy,
isn't it?

30:01.767 --> 30:03.600
You should stick with
earth tones.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.869
I hope your hands are clean.

30:05.871 --> 30:07.371
Oh. Is this yours?

30:07.606 --> 30:09.273
We thought it was your
girlfriends.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.175
Put it back in the box.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.543
That sounds like an order.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.178
Does that sound like an order
to you, mate?

30:14.180 --> 30:15.145
It sure did.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.213
You'd better do what she says.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.515
Now what is wrong
with this picture?

30:18.684 --> 30:19.817
Can anybody
tell me?

30:19.819 --> 30:21.685
These two ladies are
trying to give us orders.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.187
That's what's wrong.

30:24.456 --> 30:25.689
Oops.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.058
Do you know what a
pressure point is?

30:28.060 --> 30:29.993
Oh! And she's a smart one.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.061
Imagine that.

30:31.063 --> 30:34.064
It controls the flow of energy
in the body.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.799
What? Like this?

30:36.035 --> 30:37.234
No. Like this.

30:44.410 --> 30:45.876
Interesting isn't it?

30:47.813 --> 30:49.713
Nice, don't you think?

30:50.316 --> 30:51.248
Very.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.282
Nice.

30:52.484 --> 30:53.650
I thought so too.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.720
Come on, Frankie.
Ice cream time.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.722
So long, gents.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.757
No hard feelings.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.264
Over days or weeks...

31:07.266 --> 31:08.332
Fascinating.

31:08.334 --> 31:09.867
The interesting thing is...

31:09.869 --> 31:12.135
when you put all those
minds in one place...

31:12.771 --> 31:14.171
Ah, there's professor Barnhardt.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.606
Will you excuse me for a moment?

31:15.608 --> 31:16.640
Of course.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.777
Lovely evening, isn't it?

31:20.779 --> 31:21.912
Perfect weather.

31:21.914 --> 31:22.946
Keep your eyes open.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.681
There's enough agents
around here...

31:24.683 --> 31:26.450
to hold a convention.

31:27.753 --> 31:28.952
Keep your eye on her.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.287
The blonde?

32:24.276 --> 32:25.976
CIA's watching. Kiss me.

32:25.978 --> 32:26.643
What?

32:26.645 --> 32:28.812
CIA. Kiss me, quick.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.580
That's a kiss?

32:30.582 --> 32:31.648
You said quick.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.696
Are they...

32:45.698 --> 32:47.097
They are still there.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.036
I think they're gone.

32:53.772 --> 32:54.771
Oh.

32:54.773 --> 32:55.839
Good.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.710
Looks like the fireworks are
starting early!

32:59.845 --> 33:02.679
And where has that charming
companion of yours gone off to?

33:02.681 --> 33:03.680
Powder room.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.882
Ah yes, of course.
Will you excuse me?

34:31.969 --> 34:33.270
She's still not back?

34:33.572 --> 34:35.304
Oh... She was here... uh...
she went...

34:35.306 --> 34:36.873
She went to get a drink.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.108
Ah! I'll join her.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.777
Something's wrong.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.012
What'll we do?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.247
Here comes the professor.

35:51.884 --> 35:54.351
She's not at the bar. I wonder
where's she's gone off to?

35:54.353 --> 35:56.686
This is a magnificent property.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.922
I was just about to form a
search party.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.391
The moon is enormous.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.594
You can see it so clearly up on
the ridge.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.730
Low on the horizon tonight.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.231
Shall we go have another look?

36:12.571 --> 36:14.070
Pleasant evening, isn't it?

36:14.072 --> 36:15.138
Perfect.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.011
Do you?

36:21.013 --> 36:22.078
I do.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.290
Comrade, do we have to go on?

36:33.492 --> 36:34.925
Tell us what you know.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.793
Help us and we'll help you.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.929
You may break my body.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.098
But you'll never break
my spirit.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.334
I'll never join you.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.470
Never, never, never!

36:49.508 --> 36:50.507
Never.

36:54.046 --> 36:55.312
Good morning!

36:56.882 --> 36:57.948
Yes.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.983
Did you have a good night?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.626
I hate sheep.

37:10.462 --> 37:13.263
And last night was... strange.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.967
No. Weird. It was weird.

37:17.102 --> 37:18.668
Are you all right?

37:20.572 --> 37:21.972
I made contact.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.541
I told him I used to work on a
sheep station...

37:24.543 --> 37:25.542
so he put me to work.

37:26.311 --> 37:27.777
A lot of work.

37:28.213 --> 37:29.879
I worked in the shearing shed.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.781
Try to avoid doing that
if you can.

37:31.783 --> 37:34.017
Sweaty macho men and sheep
under stress.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.386
Sheep have tremendous gas...

37:36.388 --> 37:37.821
especially when they're
under stress.

37:37.823 --> 37:39.155
Most people don't know that.

37:40.325 --> 37:43.026
Anyway, I worked and
worked and...

37:43.562 --> 37:45.595
You know, I hate sheep.
Did I mention that?

37:45.597 --> 37:47.097
I really hate them.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.432
I hate the way they smell and
their greasy wool...

37:49.434 --> 37:51.001
and their lice.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.636
Did you know sheep have lice?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.804
The little monsters are
crawling with them.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.240
Anyway...

37:57.476 --> 37:59.676
I worked and worked and the
first night...

37:59.678 --> 38:01.978
I just collapsed on the bed.
I was dead.

38:03.749 --> 38:04.814
But the next day...

38:04.816 --> 38:06.949
I sort of got the
hang of it and...

38:06.951 --> 38:09.085
I actually had the energy to
have dinner with the grazier.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.987
That's when it got weird.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.923
No, no. It wasn't weird bad.
It was just...

38:15.994 --> 38:17.543
Weird.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.095
He made this fantastic meal on
an open campfire.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.765
Cooking on a campfire?
That is not easy.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.868
But it was the best dinner
I've ever eaten.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.103
So...

38:27.105 --> 38:29.439
He starts to serenade me
on guitar.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.108
It was the most
lovely, moving...

38:32.110 --> 38:34.678
romantic thing I've
ever heard in my life.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.147
Then he said he had a
stiff neck...

38:37.149 --> 38:38.615
and I think, this is perfect.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.150
I'll rub his neck and knock
him out...

38:40.152 --> 38:42.018
and get the book and
take off. But...

38:42.821 --> 38:44.454
I realized...

38:44.456 --> 38:46.523
I had sort of
fallen for this guy.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.793
Maybe it was just exhaustion...

38:50.162 --> 38:52.796
but I wanted to feel his strong
arms around me.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.999
I wanted to bask
in that experienced...

38:56.001 --> 38:59.703
romantic, sensitive amalgamation
of everything that was manly.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.874
So anyway, I'm
rubbing his shoulders...

39:04.876 --> 39:06.609
and I lean over to kiss him...

39:14.019 --> 39:16.052
Maybe it was past his bedtime.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.821
Geriatrics often need extra
sleep...

39:17.823 --> 39:19.489
to help with brain function.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.624
Anyway...

39:21.626 --> 39:23.326
I let him sleep and I found his
brother's diary...

39:23.328 --> 39:24.794
and photographed it.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.764
The last entry, 2 days before
he died...

39:27.766 --> 39:29.966
had a sketch of the schematic
we're looking for.

39:30.268 --> 39:32.802
Mission accomplished and
I need a shower.

39:33.271 --> 39:34.938
One minute to broadcast.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.444

40:10.609 --> 40:12.175
One of Gina's targets.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.110
What is it?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.412
They've got Howard.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.479
Who has him?

40:16.481 --> 40:17.981
Sen Sen.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.216
I'll get the gear.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.387
We're going to get him, right?

40:25.724 --> 40:27.457
You're not going to leave
him there.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.792
It's a distraction.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.127
A distraction?

40:31.129 --> 40:32.595
It's Sen Sen we're
talking about.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.097
You know what they're
capable of.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.899
It's not worth the risk.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.267
Gina, you said he was a
sweet guy.

40:37.269 --> 40:38.501
You're going to leave him?

40:38.503 --> 40:40.603
It's a dirty job but we all
signed on.

40:40.605 --> 40:42.238
Howard didn't sign on.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.407
Look, I liked him, but...

40:45.644 --> 40:48.912
Do you have any idea what he
may be going through right now?

40:51.750 --> 40:53.416
God, this is amazing!

40:53.418 --> 40:55.285
Our mother owned a restaurant.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.153
Have some more tofu.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.623
"There are just wars which serve
all of humanity,...

41:00.625 --> 41:02.091
and unjust wars which only...

41:02.093 --> 41:04.461
serve the interests of
the ruling class."

41:04.463 --> 41:05.428
That's great.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.763
One of my favorites.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.164
Pass the soup.

41:09.501 --> 41:11.434
He's going through hell.

41:13.538 --> 41:15.438
Okay. We'll get him.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.074
Get out of that towel and
make everything ready.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.110
Get busy.

41:23.281 --> 41:24.647
Hey, Cathy!

41:24.649 --> 41:26.349
How about a quick bite?

41:26.351 --> 41:29.953
I saw a cute little cafe near
that fountain in the square.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.189
Okay then. See you.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.859
Jet is fueled and ready.
Let's move it.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.729
Well, I guess this is it.

41:39.731 --> 41:40.997
It's been fun.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.365
I want you to know, I...

41:42.367 --> 41:43.500
I know.

41:43.502 --> 41:44.901
Well, goodbye then.

41:44.903 --> 41:45.935
Goodbye.

42:02.888 --> 42:04.120
Well...

42:04.356 --> 42:05.722
Don't forget me.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.190
We'll meet again...

42:07.192 --> 42:08.057
Don't know where...

42:08.059 --> 42:08.591
Don't know...

42:08.593 --> 42:09.659
Gina.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.462
Frankie's going to drive us
to the airport.

42:13.732 --> 42:14.531
Oh.

42:14.533 --> 42:15.265
Good.

42:15.267 --> 42:16.299
Let's go.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.509
Nothing personal.

42:28.246 --> 42:29.112
Uh oh!

43:37.115 --> 43:38.081
Gina...

43:38.083 --> 43:39.716
Stop playing with him.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.184
Okay.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.662
We're here for Howard, remember?

43:52.864 --> 43:54.364
He needed the practice.

44:01.106 --> 44:03.373
I could use a little help.

44:03.842 --> 44:05.141
You're doing fine.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.709
He's getting tired.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.189
Now, that is progress.

44:21.860 --> 44:23.893
Yeah. It is.

44:38.343 --> 44:39.242
Stand back!

44:48.586 --> 44:49.552
Gina!

44:49.554 --> 44:50.987
Honey, I'm home!

44:51.656 --> 44:52.689
You...

44:52.691 --> 44:54.657
You're a spy!

44:55.493 --> 44:57.160
You're all spies!

44:57.729 --> 44:59.729
Help! Intruders!

45:00.331 --> 45:03.466
There are spies in the room!
Capitalist spies in the room!

45:03.702 --> 45:04.901
Howard. Please stop.

45:04.903 --> 45:06.235
I loved you.

45:06.237 --> 45:09.072
You betrayed me, you spy!

45:10.041 --> 45:11.708
Spies in the room!

45:11.710 --> 45:14.844
I know your plans!
I know all about your plans!

45:15.346 --> 45:18.181
Help! Help!

45:29.094 --> 45:30.793
Oh, thank God!

45:31.262 --> 45:32.829
I thought I was alone.

45:33.131 --> 45:34.597
Can you play Twister?

45:40.138 --> 45:41.170
Yeah.

45:41.172 --> 45:42.205
Missile test successful.

45:42.207 --> 45:44.340
Code as: "Motherload".

45:48.613 --> 45:50.646
Ask them casually.
Nice and relaxed.

45:50.648 --> 45:51.714
Just say you were
wondering why...

45:51.716 --> 45:53.082
the scripts are so weird.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.051
Don't say "weird", say
"odd" or "unusual".

45:55.053 --> 45:55.985
That's better.

45:55.987 --> 45:57.120
But put it in your
own words...

45:57.122 --> 45:58.254
It should be
coming from you.

45:58.256 --> 45:59.222
Okay.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.590
I thought I heard voices.

46:00.592 --> 46:02.725
I was afraid the medication
was failing.

46:02.727 --> 46:04.160
We should use that line.

46:04.162 --> 46:05.595
In the Nut House sketch.

46:05.597 --> 46:07.363
Please, come in!

46:09.768 --> 46:11.801
I'm very glad about the chat
we had.

46:11.803 --> 46:12.602
Me too.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.137
Stop by anytime!

46:14.139 --> 46:15.605
I mean it from the heart.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.240
Thanks for understanding!

46:17.475 --> 46:18.741
Nice people!

46:19.077 --> 46:20.643
Putty in my hands.

46:20.945 --> 46:22.411
Not too bright, are they?

46:22.413 --> 46:23.179
No.

46:23.181 --> 46:24.547
Nice people though.

Is that right?

46:48.173 --> 46:49.705
They've jumped ahead.

46:49.707 --> 46:50.873
What does it mean?

46:50.875 --> 46:52.842
It means we've got to
work faster.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.945
I hope you've caught up
on your sleep.

46:55.947 --> 46:57.380
I've slept enough this year.

46:57.382 --> 46:59.382
Yay! They're getting younger.

46:59.384 --> 47:00.883
Look farther down.

47:00.885 --> 47:02.185
Oh. Yeah.

47:02.187 --> 47:05.054
Each of these has a piece of
the puzzle.

47:06.124 --> 47:09.025
Read the files carefully.

51:06.597 --> 51:08.130
16 dollars an hour!

51:08.132 --> 51:09.365
You get 16?

51:09.367 --> 51:10.466
I get minimum wage.

51:10.468 --> 51:11.767
Exactly, my friends!

51:11.769 --> 51:13.069
And what do your bosses get?

51:13.071 --> 51:15.371
What do the pampered and
perfumed billionaires...

51:15.373 --> 51:17.473
who own the company get

51:17.475 --> 51:19.442

51:19.444 --> 51:20.376
They get richer.

51:20.378 --> 51:20.976
Exactly!

51:20.978 --> 51:21.811
And we work hard!

51:21.813 --> 51:22.711
I bet you do!

51:22.713 --> 51:24.413

51:24.415 --> 51:25.448

51:25.750 --> 51:26.615

51:27.585 --> 51:29.118
I bet you have a good wife.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.987
A nice wife who
makes you meatloaf.

51:33.057 --> 51:34.423
Not the kind of wife who...

51:34.425 --> 51:35.491
betrays you.

51:35.927 --> 51:37.960
Betrays you! Not that
kind who...

51:38.463 --> 51:40.729
magnetizes you with her
brown eyes and then...

51:40.731 --> 51:42.832
lures you in with
her kisses and then...

51:42.834 --> 51:44.066
and then...

51:44.068 --> 51:46.735
stabs you through the heart,

Okay guys, I've got bad news.

51:57.181 --> 51:59.115
The servers crashed and ate
the whole 1st Act.

51:59.117 --> 52:00.850
So you have to do the
opening number live.

52:00.852 --> 52:02.118
Don't they have backups?

52:02.120 --> 52:04.987
They have backups of backups
but they're all corrupted.

52:05.590 --> 52:08.124
Maybe it's a virus,
I don't know.

52:08.126 --> 52:09.658
You have to be ready
in 10 minutes.

52:09.660 --> 52:11.293
We're ready. No Problem.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.862
No problem at all.

52:12.864 --> 52:14.196
You know, actually
this is good...

52:14.198 --> 52:15.664
bacause these are the
lyrics I don't like.

52:15.967 --> 52:17.933
There's no time to send
lyrics back to the writers.

52:17.935 --> 52:20.169
We don't need writers. We'll
just write it ourselves.

52:20.438 --> 52:21.437
We should get it approved.

52:21.439 --> 52:22.938
This is supposed to be our show.

52:22.940 --> 52:24.473
Our name's on it.

52:24.475 --> 52:27.042
It's good, but I still think
we should get it checked.

52:27.044 --> 52:29.945
We're on in 8 minutes.
Let's just go with it.

52:29.947 --> 52:31.514
All right.

52:32.283 --> 52:35.151
In 10 minutes Nola will
be at point one...

52:35.153 --> 52:37.653
5 minutes later I'll be
at point two.

52:37.655 --> 52:39.622
When the phone rings
what happens?

52:39.624 --> 52:42.625
If Cathy says she's on for
dinner it means abort.

52:43.161 --> 52:45.895
If she has a headache
I proceed to point three.

52:46.464 --> 52:47.530
Okay.

52:48.566 --> 52:49.632
Let's go.

53:22.400 --> 53:23.666
Is everything ready?

53:23.668 --> 53:25.868
Capture team is in place
in front and rear.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.703
Ground floor,
completely covered.

53:27.705 --> 53:28.837
Stay sharp.

53:28.839 --> 53:31.340
They don't look dangerous
but they are.

53:31.342 --> 53:32.908
Yes, doctor.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.346
It's a trap.

53:43.955 --> 53:46.455
At least I can see
what killed her.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.523
It's a trap.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.633
It's not her.

53:57.635 --> 53:59.034
But she'll do.

53:59.036 --> 54:00.669
Take her to the room.

54:23.227 --> 54:24.960
Meatloaf.

54:25.496 --> 54:27.963
Honey. Wake up!

54:27.965 --> 54:29.565
Honey!

54:29.567 --> 54:31.834
It's dinner time!

54:31.836 --> 54:33.202
Num, num, num...

54:34.238 --> 54:35.137
Oh no.

54:35.139 --> 54:36.005
Oh yes!

54:36.007 --> 54:36.972
It's me!

54:36.974 --> 54:38.173
Your loving husband!

54:38.175 --> 54:39.775
Your loving husband you
betrayed...

54:39.777 --> 54:42.344
and left for dead on a
filthy disease-ridden island!

54:42.346 --> 54:43.679
It was a nice island.

54:43.681 --> 54:45.314
It was tropical!

54:45.316 --> 54:47.416
Do you know how many diseases
there are in the tropics?

54:47.418 --> 54:48.651
I'm lucky to be alive.

54:48.653 --> 54:50.119
Yes, it looks like it.

54:50.121 --> 54:52.054
Don't try your punch lines on
me! You're not funny.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.255
Honey, listen.

54:53.257 --> 54:54.456
Don't you "honey" me!

54:54.458 --> 54:56.292
I loved you. I loved you!

54:56.294 --> 54:57.092
And you...

54:57.094 --> 54:58.027
I can explain.

54:58.029 --> 54:59.328
Oh yes! I'm
sure you can.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.397
You think you're such a
clever girl, don't you?

55:02.300 --> 55:04.233
Tell me, clever girl, do
you know what Karma is?

55:04.502 --> 55:07.036
The result of past actions
performed in this life...

55:07.038 --> 55:08.871
or previous incarnations.

55:10.708 --> 55:12.174
Shut up! You know-it-all!

55:12.176 --> 55:13.709
That was a rhetorical question.

55:14.011 --> 55:15.778
This. This is Karma.

55:15.780 --> 55:16.945
That's meatloaf.

55:17.181 --> 55:18.981
It's a metaphor you idiot!

55:18.983 --> 55:20.849
Do you know who's
in this meatloaf?

55:20.851 --> 55:22.484
The very same guards
that you left...

55:22.486 --> 55:24.153
stranded on the desert island!

55:24.155 --> 55:25.220
Well...

55:25.890 --> 55:27.122
I killed them!

55:27.124 --> 55:28.724
I killed them all
and I ate them!

55:28.726 --> 55:30.192
All except this
little portion...

55:30.194 --> 55:32.061
that I saved for
my dearly beloved!

55:40.738 --> 55:42.371
I love to laugh.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.040
Did you know laughing is
good for the immune system?

55:45.042 --> 55:46.408
Can I ask you something?

55:46.744 --> 55:48.877
Oh. Sure. Go ahead. Ask away.

55:49.213 --> 55:50.562
I know your tricks.

55:50.564 --> 55:51.914
You're going to say things
that make me remember...

55:51.916 --> 55:53.215
how I fell for you.

55:53.217 --> 55:55.584
I don't love you now. I don't.
Not one bit.

55:55.586 --> 55:57.853
You can talk your
head off for all I care.

55:57.855 --> 55:59.988
Nothing you can say will make
me change my mind.

55:59.990 --> 56:01.590
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

56:15.673 --> 56:18.340
I'm sorry! It's not
really the guards...

56:18.342 --> 56:21.977
it's ground beef, very lean,
organic, free range.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.746
I didn't kill anybody.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.347
I know. It's okay.

56:25.349 --> 56:28.250
I just wanted to scare you.
I missed you so much!

56:28.252 --> 56:31.687
I know. I know. Shhh.
I missed you too.

56:31.956 --> 56:33.589
He had a hard week.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.591
She's not going to
take me away is she?

56:35.593 --> 56:37.092
Don't let her take me away!

56:37.094 --> 56:38.060
Shhh!

56:38.062 --> 56:39.962
Nobody's going to
take you away.

56:39.964 --> 56:40.929
It's okay.

56:40.931 --> 56:42.297
I don't want to go away.

56:42.299 --> 56:43.899
You won't go away. I promise.

56:43.901 --> 56:46.101
But mama has to
work now, honey.

56:46.103 --> 56:47.369
Do you have to?

56:47.371 --> 56:50.572
Yes, but I'll be back
this time. I promise.

56:50.574 --> 56:53.776
You just lie down and have a
rest and I'll be back later.

56:53.778 --> 56:54.810
Promise?

56:54.812 --> 56:55.778
Cross my heart.

56:55.780 --> 56:57.212
And hope to die?

56:57.214 --> 56:58.213
Yes.

57:20.938 --> 57:24.339
I trust you're finding the
accommodations comfortable.

57:24.842 --> 57:26.775
What do you say we
have a little talk...

57:26.777 --> 57:28.377
about a friend
of yours.

57:29.980 --> 57:31.213
Come now.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.715
This is no time for sleep.

57:35.352 --> 57:36.685
She's dead.

57:37.288 --> 57:39.488
Did you change the
dosage in the darts?

57:39.490 --> 57:40.589
No, sir.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.224
It was exactly as
you gave us.

57:43.294 --> 57:45.093
Such a pity.

57:46.430 --> 57:48.997
I would have loved to
get to know you better.

57:52.369 --> 57:54.436
Go get the autopsy
room ready!

57:56.207 --> 57:58.874
At least I can see
what killed her.

58:00.678 --> 58:01.743
Doctor?

58:02.446 --> 58:03.545
How did you...

58:03.547 --> 58:06.582
What you don't know
could fill a library.

58:12.456 --> 58:13.622
Hey, doc!

58:14.525 --> 58:15.891
You all right?

58:16.460 --> 58:17.693
He's all wrong.

58:34.411 --> 58:35.944
Nice rescue.

58:41.685 --> 58:42.551
Hey, guys!

58:42.553 --> 58:43.652
What about me?

59:00.671 --> 59:01.637
What?

59:02.840 --> 59:03.939
I was...

59:03.941 --> 59:05.007
Concentrate!

59:05.442 --> 59:07.142
You've got drugs in your system.

59:07.912 --> 59:08.911
What happened?

59:08.913 --> 59:09.978
Doesn't matter.

59:11.382 --> 59:12.514
Let's get out of here.

59:12.516 --> 59:13.515
Lean on me.

59:13.684 --> 59:14.750
Focus!

59:19.723 --> 59:21.323
So what happened?

59:21.792 --> 59:23.492
The code is compromised.

59:23.761 --> 59:25.260
What do we do?

59:26.363 --> 59:28.130
We go to Plan B.

59:31.468 --> 59:33.268
What is Plan B?

59:33.637 --> 59:34.636
Canceled?

59:34.638 --> 59:36.071
What do you mean canceled?

59:36.073 --> 59:37.940
What does canceled
usually mean?

59:37.942 --> 59:39.141
We were number three!

59:39.143 --> 59:40.542
That was two weeks ago.

59:40.544 --> 59:41.944
Things move fast in
this town, baby.

59:41.946 --> 59:43.145
You know what,
they're bluffing!

59:43.147 --> 59:44.279
Our contract's
up for renewal...

59:44.281 --> 59:45.247
and they're trying
to scare us.

59:45.249 --> 59:46.214
Are they?

59:46.216 --> 59:47.215
I know they are.

59:47.217 --> 59:48.951
I mean, how could
you replace us?

59:48.953 --> 59:51.119
Who could possibly replace us?

59:51.455 --> 59:53.088

How much of that can she drink?

It's the code we need,

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:33.528
Okay. Looks like we're on.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.664
How long do you
want with Howard?

01:00:35.666 --> 01:00:36.832
About half an hour.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:37.599
All right.

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:38.834
Don't go breaking up the band.

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:40.102
Are you kidding?

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.108
Wheels up
at 5 o'clock.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.009
Check.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:53.181
Interesting.

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.184
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:00:57.488 --> 01:00:58.954
We had a deal, doctor!

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:02.924
Yes.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.360
Of course.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:06.895
Ahhhhh...

01:01:07.564 --> 01:01:08.864
Have you had measles?

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.399
Any shortness of breath?

01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:11.199
Mumps?

01:01:11.201 --> 01:01:12.167
Dizziness?

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.068
Chicken Pox?

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.036
Trouble sleeping?

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.003
Diphtheria?

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.471
Not that I've noticed...

01:01:17.307 --> 01:01:18.373
Okay.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.811
I've got bad news and good news.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.546
Bad news.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:26.848
Tawney Tadwyler had
a heart attack.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:27.482
Who?

01:01:27.484 --> 01:01:28.850
The girl on TV.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:31.820
Apparently she had one-too-many
energy drinks.

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:33.288
What's the good news?

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:35.457
The Gorillas are back on.

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.759
Brand new show!
Brand new song!

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.828
Your wish comes true, Thursday!

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:41.163
These...

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.165
are the infamous
"Jaguar Gem" earrings...

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.933
that belonged to
the Queen of Malta.

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:47.034
Ooh!

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.569
In the left earring,
the dim silhouette...

01:01:48.572 --> 01:01:52.307
of a 1967 12-cylinder
Jaguar convertible.

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:53.842
Sporty!

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:55.343
In the right one...

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:56.812
an auto repair shop.

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.680
You can't have one
without the other.

01:01:58.682 --> 01:01:59.748
Oh!

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.851
Tune in Friday for "The
Curse of the Jaguar Gem".

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.086
Looks good.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.622
The earrings contain microchips.

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:10.358
Blueprints for the Cobalt 3
hypersonic weapons system.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:11.593
What's the play?

01:02:11.929 --> 01:02:13.695
We get them before
someone else does.

01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:16.598
The earrings won't be on
the show until Friday...

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.467
so we'll grab them tomorrow.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:20.969
Uh...

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:22.204
I think it works.

01:02:22.206 --> 01:02:23.672
No. It needs something.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.440
Hey, these are cool.

01:02:25.442 --> 01:02:27.409
Not a chance!
Those are Friday's episode.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.577
Go pick something else.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.078
Look at them sparkle!
They're perfect!

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.114
Yeah, they're perfect for
Friday's episode.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.715
So go talk to the producers.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.383
In the meantime,
pick something else.

01:02:35.385 --> 01:02:37.385
You don't want me to
lose my job, do you?

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:38.686
No...

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:39.988
Couldn't you just
talk to them and...

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:41.056
Come on, give me a break!

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:42.124
Hey, these are nice!

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:44.126
Careful!

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.160
They'll fall apart...

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.229
and we'll have beads
all over the place

01:02:47.231 --> 01:02:48.430
See?
They're unravelling

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.664
How about those?

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:51.333
These are nice.
What do you think?

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:53.435
I'm having second thoughts.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:55.170
I'm thinking: No earrings.

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:56.338
Minimalist.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.405
That's what it is.

01:02:57.407 --> 01:02:58.140
She's right.

01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.241
She's not.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:00.375
Surprise!

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:05.480
I feel so safe with you.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:08.083
Remind me to cancel
your surprise party.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:10.886
What an idiot, jumping
out like that.

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:12.854
I...

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.156
think I'm in love.

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:15.490
I think it's
head trauma.

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:17.592
You slipped and
hit your head.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:20.028
Oh. That's why
I feel dizzy.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.263
One of the reasons.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:22.264
Can you stand?

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:26.334
Think you can get the door
without doing any damage?

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:30.839
Nola, check
the broadcast.

01:03:32.276 --> 01:03:33.275
Don't be angry.

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:34.376
Howard, I told you!

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.011
I know, darling, but I
couldn't stay away.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.345
And just who is this?

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:38.346
Frankie, please.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:39.481
I'm Gina's husband.

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.448
Howard, please.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:42.017
And just who are you?

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:45.554
Shawn's the name,
Frankie Shawn.

01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:47.556
Excuse me, 007.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:49.724
How did you find us?

01:03:49.726 --> 01:03:51.026
I asked my friends.

01:03:51.028 --> 01:03:52.194
What friends?

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:54.062
Them!

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:57.132
I didn't know they
were actors.

01:03:58.735 --> 01:04:00.202
Who doesn't know we're here?

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:02.437
We've got a bigger problem.
Look what he's wearing.

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:04.506
We've got to move.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:05.774
I'll get the gear.

01:04:05.909 --> 01:04:07.075
You have to stay here.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:08.043
Where you go, I go.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:08.810
You can't.

01:04:08.812 --> 01:04:10.261
I'm going with you.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.713
If the lady says stay, you stay.

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:12.681
Frankie, please.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.916
Listen, double-o-
whatever-your-name-is...

01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.718
I don't like your tone,
little Husband.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.019
Howard, Frankie, please!

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.154
Gina, we have to move.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:19.921
Just a minute.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.022
We need to move now!

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.390
I said, just a minute.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:23.859
We're having a discussion.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:25.460
Do you mind?

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.128
Do I mind?

01:04:27.497 --> 01:04:28.830
Yes. I do.

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.899
You didn't have to do that.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:32.734
Oh, you're going to give
me a problem now?

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:33.401
I might.

01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:34.069
You might?

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:34.603
Oh yeah.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:35.170
Really?

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:36.171
Look!

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:42.410
Nice job.

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:43.979
What happened?

01:04:44.514 --> 01:04:46.081
Mommy lost
her temper.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:48.283
That was not okay!

01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:49.184
I'm sorry.

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.185
Frankie too.

01:04:52.689 --> 01:04:54.356
The one with
the pink ribbon.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:55.690
Hello.

01:04:55.692 --> 01:04:56.758
What about Howard?

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:58.860
Let him sleep.
We're better off.

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:00.562
I must have hit
my head again.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:02.264
You have to be more careful.

01:05:04.101 --> 01:05:05.634
<i>♪ so what's your wish?</i>

01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:07.302

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.492
Go, Marvin!

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.529
They're so positive!

01:05:35.232 --> 01:05:36.598
It's a catchy song.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.999
So talented!

01:05:38.302 --> 01:05:40.735
Backstage we'll kill them
and take the earrings.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.081
Look at the traffic!

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.516
We'll never make it.

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:55.583
Gina, go!

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.485
Gina...

01:05:58.322 --> 01:05:59.387
That way.

01:06:00.657 --> 01:06:02.023
What do we do?

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:16.398
Honey?

01:07:18.502 --> 01:07:19.834
Go, Marvin!

01:07:30.247 --> 01:07:31.446
Hello.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:33.681
Hello, ma'am. Can I see
your credentials?

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.783
Of course.

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:36.651
I've got them right here.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:46.394
And cut!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.530
We are off the air.
At commercial for...

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.698
6 minutes and 45 seconds.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.468
Marvin, you want to set
them up while I prep?

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.905
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a commercial break...

01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.440
but that doesn't mean
that we get a break.

01:07:58.442 --> 01:08:00.041
So just stay seated...

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:02.243
unless you have urgent
personal needs...

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.346
that can be taken care of
in 5 minutes or less...

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.782
like these gentlemen
have apparently.

01:08:07.784 --> 01:08:09.317
2nd door on the left, Gents!

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:10.718
In the meantime,
how are we doing?

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:14.889
Man, these pinch!

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:16.124
You shouldn't have
stolen them.

01:08:16.126 --> 01:08:16.957
I borrowed them.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.992
Uh huh...

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.595
What a talented
couple you are!

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.130
Can I get your autograph?

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.598
Sorry. You're not supposed
to be back here.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.832
I know. I told them.

01:08:24.835 --> 01:08:27.669
But they are such big fans,
they insisted.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:29.703
It's okay. Do you have a pen?

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:35.310
Not only are you both
incredibly talented...

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.612
but you've got a real
flair for fashion.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.647
Well, it's not only us.
We have some help.

01:08:39.649 --> 01:08:41.649
The costumer's great
on this show.

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.518
Those earrings, for example.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.853
They look great on you.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.321
Earrings... Oh yeah.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:47.654
Shoot! Where'd I put them?

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.624
You'd better find them.
We go on in 3 minutes.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:50.640
Uh...

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:51.658
Maybe in that case?

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.027
In the coat?

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.662
We should help them.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.233
Is he okay?

01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:00.001
He gets fainting spells.

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:01.368
Low blood sugar.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:03.837
You wouldn't happen to have a
glucose tablet would you?

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:04.805
We have coffee creamer.

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.107
And donuts.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:07.742
That might be good.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.444
It's catching.

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.113
They're twins.

01:09:12.115 --> 01:09:13.381
It runs in the family.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:16.551
We're on in two.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:17.519
What happened to them?

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.620
Low blood sugar.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.487
Get a medic, would you?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.622
Okay, but hurry up!

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.023
Live TV waits for no one!

01:09:22.459 --> 01:09:23.358
Hey!

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:24.626
Found them!

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:30.465
Is it me or is that weird?

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.533
It's weird.

01:09:31.535 --> 01:09:33.401
The medic will take care
of them. Let's go.

01:09:34.037 --> 01:09:34.969
Okay kids...

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.639
This is a fantasy sequence,
we're inside of Michael's head.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.575
Not a particularly great place
to be but here we are.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:42.743
I don't think that's funny.

01:09:42.746 --> 01:09:43.578
Shh!

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.313
So I want you all
up and dancing...

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.182
having the time
of your lives...

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:48.082
happy happy happy!

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:49.751
And this is
live television...

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:52.886
so no matter what happens,
keep on dancing.

01:09:52.889 --> 01:09:53.955
Okay?

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.625
We're on in five... four...

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:17.845
Doctor and guards are
knocked out backstage.

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:20.848
Sen Sen is over there
doing the "Mashed Potato".

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.355
Frankie, you get the earrings.

01:10:27.357 --> 01:10:29.090
You both come with me.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:00.955
I know your tricks!

01:11:01.324 --> 01:11:04.125
100% Malaysian rubber!
Non-conductive!

01:11:04.127 --> 01:11:06.060
Go ahead and try.
You can't knock me out!

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:08.196
Very clever.

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:27.248
Dancing! You're dancing!
This isn't a Bruce Lee movie!

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:47.335
He's a good fighter.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:49.037
You.

01:11:51.508 --> 01:11:52.907
How do I look?

01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:56.444
Nice, huh?

01:11:58.181 --> 01:11:59.580
Frankie, what are you doing?

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:01.683
I have the...

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:02.350
Hey!

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:06.721
I'll get him.

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:10.024
He's a better fighter.

01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:11.359
Wait for me!

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.428
You!

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:17.298
Krista! That is very violent.

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:35.450
Hey. Howard.

01:12:51.334 --> 01:12:52.333
Run.

01:12:52.335 --> 01:12:53.401
What?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:54.635
Run.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:12:59.674
We should run.

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.587
Old school.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.761
I just felt that in order
to fulfill my duties...

01:13:19.763 --> 01:13:22.096
I had to make certain choices.

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.665
That's an excellent point,
and a positive one.

01:13:25.702 --> 01:13:26.934
I feel good about that.

01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.604
Knowing you understand
means a lot to me.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.038
It's very validating.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.274
Now, Howard, how does
that make you feel?

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:34.475
Well...

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:35.943
I felt abandoned, and...

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:36.911
Nobody abandoned...

01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:37.912
Gina.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.046
This is Howard's moment.

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:40.047
Sorry.

01:13:40.049 --> 01:13:41.149
Thank you, Frankie.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:43.151
I felt worthless...

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:45.920
Like a plastic bottle thrown
into the recycle bin.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.755
That's perfectly valid.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.757
Although, to be accurate...

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.059
recycled bottles
do have some value.

01:13:52.495 --> 01:13:54.529
Thank you, Frankie,
for that positive note.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.231
Gina, how does
that make you feel?

01:13:57.434 --> 01:13:58.299
Well, I...

01:13:58.301 --> 01:14:01.002
Sorry to interrupt, keep
going with your counseling...

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:03.671
but I've got a
splitting headache and...

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:05.473
I'm taking a nap.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:06.808
You have your meeting.

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:10.745
I know. Thanks.
I'm going to lay down.

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:14.015
Violence doesn't pay.

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:18.352
Now, Gina, you were
talking about your feelings.

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:21.856
Yes, my intention wasn't
to abandon anybody...

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:32.600
Let her have it!

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:41.309
For a job that never ends.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.010
It's like cleaning house.

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:46.747
As soon as you've done it, it's
time to start cleaning again.

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.450
But you put on a good show.

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:51.552
So good that we get a sequel.

01:14:51.554 --> 01:14:52.854
Sequel?

01:14:52.856 --> 01:14:55.790
Sequel. Franchise.
Money. Lots of money.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:59.694
But there's one little
change. Just one.

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:00.728
Girls.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.631
Meet your replacements.

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:10.771
No!

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:12.773
What is it?

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:16.277
A Hollywood nightmare!

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:20.214

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.037
Action!

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:09.176
Are you okay?

01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.045
I'm going to the
drugstore...

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:12.713
I'll be right
back...

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:17.551
Nice job.

01:19:17.553 --> 01:19:18.486
Outtake!

01:19:18.488 --> 01:19:19.954
Krista's still
meditating.

01:19:21.758 --> 01:19:22.757
One more time.

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:24.625
Bigger, faster,
and action!

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:26.360
Robyn...

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:28.929
Sweetheart! Have I
got a gig for you!

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:31.265
Well, we're cutting!

01:19:33.136 --> 01:19:34.635
Tell us what you know!

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:38.005
Sorry, I'm just a bit
lost with the lines...

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:42.510
Freeze in position,
okay.

01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:45.179
Ready? Action,
beat, turn...

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.381
Beat, beat, up.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.850
Let him go, let him go.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.154
Work. Work.
Keep working.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.723
Action, beat, turn.

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:57.758
It's not poisonous.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.193
Well it looked
poisonous.

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:02.229
Make yourself useful
and turn the ignition...

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:04.532
Don't start it until
I tell you.

01:20:05.935 --> 01:20:08.869
Great! One more and we're
done. And... Action!

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.205
It's not useful.

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:16.844
Hey guys, what about me?

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.048
Action!

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.857
Oop. That was
down, Frank.

01:20:30.026 --> 01:20:31.091
Cut.

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:33.294
No, the wrong guy.

01:20:35.198 --> 01:20:36.363
You knocked out
the wrong guy.

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:37.398
Oh!

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:40.534
Gina.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:43.904
Doctor and guards are...

01:20:45.675 --> 01:20:47.107
Okay... Okay.

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.375
Do it again.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:50.678
Action!

01:20:50.847 --> 01:20:51.912
Doctor and guards
are...

01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:53.047
Uh...

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:54.014
Cut!

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:54.615
Sorry.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:02.356
Sorry, sorry.

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:03.424
Okay, cutting.

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:21.575
You're the wrong way.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:24.445
Action!

01:21:27.049 --> 01:21:28.115
Hey, doc!

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:29.617
You all right?

01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.653
Cut.

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:34.221
She's stuck!

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.222
She's stuck in
the chair.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:36.957
Back to "one".

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:33.447
Death suits you
well, it seems.

01:22:38.164 --> 01:22:39.117
