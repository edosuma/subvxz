00:18.379 --> 00:20.651
You regret moving in?

00:20.675 --> 00:22.134
I don't.

00:22.158 --> 00:24.138
It's your shift.

00:24.162 --> 00:26.489
Yeah, I kinda regret it.

00:26.513 --> 00:28.146
I'm up!

00:28.170 --> 00:30.636
Thank you for not regretting it.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.806
You're the best.

00:37.756 --> 00:41.092
Okay, little buddy. It's okay, buddy.

00:46.930 --> 00:50.118
I don't understand a word of this,

00:50.142 --> 00:52.716
but somehow it's working.

00:52.740 --> 00:56.143
"Go shine your light, Bella.

00:56.167 --> 00:57.591
Tell your truth."

00:58.819 --> 01:00.763
- Was that "Kiss me"?
- Yeah.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.869
Can we call in sick?

01:06.893 --> 01:08.299
Aw.

01:08.323 --> 01:10.303
I mean, I don't want
to pretend to hate you.

01:10.327 --> 01:11.981
You can just pretend to respect me.

01:12.005 --> 01:14.518
I-I do respect you.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.812
Mostly.

01:16.836 --> 01:18.653
I mean, I think you promoted
the wrong Captain,

01:18.677 --> 01:20.739
- but other than that...
- Oh, oh, oh, shh, shh.

01:30.764 --> 01:32.570
Captain, you know, uh, PRT's stood down

01:32.594 --> 01:34.296
for maintenance and inventory today.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.829
I know.

01:36.333 --> 01:37.595
You doing your treatment, sir?

01:37.619 --> 01:39.229
No, I'm not, which you know. I know.

01:39.253 --> 01:41.384
I know you're not doing
radiation or surgery,

01:41.408 --> 01:44.094
but, you know, there's, uh,
there's palliative care.

01:44.118 --> 01:45.867
Oh, palliative? Like hospice?

01:45.891 --> 01:48.231
No, no, like pain management

01:48.255 --> 01:49.843
or integrative therapy, physical therapy.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.341
I'm doing all that in my own way.

01:51.365 --> 01:53.013
Listen, I, uh, need your help.

01:53.037 --> 01:54.089
With what?

01:54.113 --> 01:57.880
Well, let's take a drive,
and you'll find out.

02:03.053 --> 02:05.727
Hey. I heard, uh,
Vasquez goes home today.

02:07.882 --> 02:08.970
How you doing, Jack?

02:08.994 --> 02:10.430
Half the team still won't look at me,

02:10.454 --> 02:11.703
but the shiner's gone.

02:16.362 --> 02:18.288
You didn't come home again last night.

02:18.312 --> 02:19.781
I'm...

02:19.805 --> 02:21.383
Yeah.

02:21.407 --> 02:22.840
Did you meet someone, or...?

02:22.864 --> 02:25.850
Not anyone I'm ready to talk about.

02:27.495 --> 02:28.653
Don't get weird.

02:28.678 --> 02:30.809
No, I'm not weird. I w... I was worried.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.278
You know, you could text if
you're gonna be out all night,

02:33.303 --> 02:35.712
'cause... Jack the Ripper was a thing.

02:36.919 --> 02:38.320
Deal, but then it goes both ways,

02:38.345 --> 02:41.953
because Jackie the Ripper
is a thing, too.

02:42.259 --> 02:43.556
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it could be.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.704
It could happen. And...

02:44.729 --> 02:46.187
Herrera! A word?

02:48.731 --> 02:50.724
My dad used to do that.

02:50.749 --> 02:51.767
Do what?

02:51.792 --> 02:53.506
Bellow across the firehouse,

02:53.531 --> 02:56.449
like summoning people
like a king on a throne.

03:00.437 --> 03:02.012
Lieutenant Herrera,

03:02.037 --> 03:04.387
Captain Bishop has requested a meeting

03:04.412 --> 03:05.731
with the two of us.

03:07.847 --> 03:10.430
Uh... about... about what?

03:10.455 --> 03:12.886
Well, she wouldn't tell me
until you were here, so...

03:14.642 --> 03:16.009
You have something to say to me?

03:16.034 --> 03:17.248
I do.

03:19.217 --> 03:21.661
Chief Sullivan,
I think you made a mistake.

03:21.685 --> 03:23.920
I think you gave me a medal
I didn't earn.

03:23.944 --> 03:26.562
Herrera has more experience.
She has the respect of the team.

03:26.586 --> 03:29.894
She was on deck, sir,
and I stepped past her.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.126
I asked for the job,
and that was hubris on my part.

03:33.150 --> 03:35.338
And you gave me the job, and that was...

03:36.973 --> 03:38.340
You know, I think you were trying

03:38.364 --> 03:40.182
to protect her from her own grief,

03:40.206 --> 03:42.182
and I think it was a mistake.

03:42.207 --> 03:44.199
Andy Herrera deserves
the job you gave me.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.520
She has more than earned it.

03:45.545 --> 03:48.393
And... I don't want it anymore.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.799
I'll take it into consideration.

03:52.824 --> 03:54.815
- Sir.
- Are you quitting?

03:54.840 --> 03:56.937
Are you gonna walk out that door
and never come back?

03:56.962 --> 03:58.571
No, sir. I'm requesting a demotion.

03:58.596 --> 04:00.816
And I will take that request
into consideration.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.768
For right now, we all have jobs to do.

04:02.793 --> 04:04.619
So, Captain Bishop...

04:05.263 --> 04:06.443
get to work.

04:09.370 --> 04:12.196
Medical response on channel 4 for Aid 19,

04:12.221 --> 04:13.796
2300 Oak Avenue.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.944
Reported injury.

04:14.969 --> 04:17.048
That's you and Gibson.

04:19.974 --> 04:22.418
Dispatch from Aid 19, confirm address.

04:22.443 --> 04:24.470
Aid 19, dispatch. 2300 Oak Avenue.

04:24.495 --> 04:26.660
The injured party is reported
to be an employee

04:26.685 --> 04:28.849
inside a military surplus store.

04:28.874 --> 04:30.136
Copy.

04:31.275 --> 04:32.954
What was that about?

04:32.979 --> 04:34.797
What was... What was what about?

04:34.822 --> 04:36.918
Secret meeting with Sullivan and Bishop.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.413
It wasn't a secret.

04:38.438 --> 04:39.897
Then what was it?

04:41.134 --> 04:42.291
Am I getting fired?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.587
Jack. Vasquez is fine.

04:44.612 --> 04:45.839
He's going home today.

04:45.864 --> 04:47.786
Doesn't mean I don't deserve to be fired.

04:47.811 --> 04:49.698
Dean hates me. You hate Bishop.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.887
I hate myself.

04:51.912 --> 04:54.320
If they don't fire me, I think
I should put in for a transfer.

04:54.345 --> 04:55.434
No.

04:55.459 --> 04:57.172
No.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.564
This is... No.

04:58.589 --> 04:59.886
We're gonna get through this.

04:59.911 --> 05:02.501
We're gonna get through it
as a family, okay?

05:02.526 --> 05:04.145
No one's going anywhere.

05:16.304 --> 05:18.366
- Give me my money back!
- Beat it, psycho!

05:18.390 --> 05:20.243
- Hey! Take it easy! Take it easy!
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

05:20.267 --> 05:22.224
- Dispatch from Aid 19.
- Everybody out!

05:22.248 --> 05:24.020
Help the firefighters at 2300 Oak Avenue.

05:24.044 --> 05:25.903
This is an ongoing assault.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.784
Have units respond without sirens.

05:27.808 --> 05:29.696
He cut me! Arrest this maniac!

05:29.720 --> 05:31.086
Arrest me?! You're the criminal!

05:31.110 --> 05:32.303
Nobody's getting arrested.

05:32.327 --> 05:34.570
We're not cops.
Just put the weapons down!

05:34.594 --> 05:35.992
- Stop!
- Him first!

05:36.016 --> 05:38.439
- Back!
- Okay. We're back. I'm back.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.420
Okay, just tell us what's going on.

05:40.444 --> 05:43.583
I sold my knife here
a week ago for 20 bucks.

05:43.607 --> 05:46.676
And I came in here to buy it
back, and he wants $40.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.379
Inflation's a bitch, kid.

05:48.403 --> 05:50.013
- Sir, not helpful.
- Ignore him.

05:50.037 --> 05:51.543
Hey. Look at me. Look at me.

05:51.567 --> 05:52.932
- Take it easy.
- What's your name?

05:55.226 --> 05:57.739
- I'm Kyle.
- Okay, I'm... I'm Jack.

05:57.763 --> 06:01.007
Now, sounds like that knife
means something to you.

06:01.031 --> 06:02.779
So, here.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.274
Buy it back.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.761
Then you and I can take a walk

06:05.785 --> 06:08.006
while my partner treats
that cut on his arm.

06:08.030 --> 06:09.285
What do you say?

06:09.309 --> 06:12.239
Why? So he can rip off
the next vet that walks in?

06:12.263 --> 06:13.455
You're a veteran, Kyle?

06:13.479 --> 06:14.464
Crazed veteran!

06:14.488 --> 06:15.645
- Shut... up!
- Hey!

06:15.669 --> 06:16.931
Hey, hey, hey.

06:16.955 --> 06:18.113
Dispatch from Aid 19.
Thank you for your service.

06:18.137 --> 06:19.816
Tell Chief Sullivan we're dealing with

06:19.840 --> 06:21.491
- a troubled veteran who's armed
- How original.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.257
And he needs to get here now.

06:23.281 --> 06:25.050
You know, I'd thank you for your
gratitude if it didn't ring hollow.

06:25.074 --> 06:26.927
Okay, I get that.
I didn't mean to offend.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.639
Let's just... Just take the cash, okay?

06:29.663 --> 06:31.496
Buy your knife, and... and
let's... let's get out of here.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.876
What do you say?

06:47.621 --> 06:48.988
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:51.225 --> 06:53.723
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa! Easy, Kyle! Easy!

06:53.748 --> 06:55.275
See? Psycho!

06:56.668 --> 06:59.077
We got to get out of here... now.

06:59.102 --> 07:01.509
If anyone goes out that door,
I'll drop this spoon

07:01.533 --> 07:02.934
and blow up this whole block.

07:02.958 --> 07:05.450
The entire block? Is there
something we need to know, Kyle?

07:05.474 --> 07:07.467
Jimmy here sells all kinds of goodies.

07:07.491 --> 07:10.595
He sells ammo, C4, land mines.

07:10.619 --> 07:12.785
There's plenty more where this came from.

07:15.172 --> 07:17.299
You're standing in a powder keg.

Uh... yeah.

07:32.304 --> 07:35.408
I-I'm here for the Chief.

07:35.432 --> 07:38.778
I'm s-sorry, sir. The Ch... um...

07:38.802 --> 07:40.621
Chief doesn't work here.

07:40.645 --> 07:42.116
Unless you mean Sullivan.

07:42.140 --> 07:44.792
No. Not Sullivan.

07:44.816 --> 07:46.273
The Chief!

07:47.526 --> 07:49.367
Okay, uh, can I tell him who's here?

07:52.219 --> 07:54.302
Sir, uh, what's your name?

07:56.146 --> 07:58.590
- Get the Chief now...
- Okay...

07:58.614 --> 08:00.119
- or I'm gone!
- All right, s...

08:00.143 --> 08:01.336
Oh, you know what? You're in luck.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.283
- He's right here. He is right here.
- What?

08:03.307 --> 08:05.472
Uh, this man is here to see
the Chief, which is you.

08:05.496 --> 08:07.036
Uh, it... it is?

08:07.060 --> 08:10.234
So, Chief, uh, this gentleman is...

08:10.258 --> 08:12.563
here to see you, Chief.

08:12.587 --> 08:14.227
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

08:15.089 --> 08:17.324
perhaps we could show
this gentleman to your office?

08:17.348 --> 08:19.166
Wait, I have an office?

08:19.190 --> 08:20.209
It's just... Okay.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.193
All right, after you, sir.

08:22.925 --> 08:24.258
Right through here.

08:24.283 --> 08:25.510

Oh, my mistake, Victoria.

08:44.713 --> 08:46.739
How'd you do on the math test?

08:46.764 --> 08:48.096
I got a B-minus.

08:48.121 --> 08:49.904
B-minus? Hmm.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.372
You know what that makes you?

08:51.397 --> 08:52.589
What?

08:52.614 --> 08:53.980
Some kind of math genius.

08:55.119 --> 08:57.527
I never passed a math test in my life.

08:57.552 --> 08:59.885

really been very good at...

09:05.890 --> 09:08.522
- Math?
- Oh, no, he was excellent at math.

09:08.547 --> 09:11.407
He's never been good at fun.

09:11.432 --> 09:12.742
I mean, look at him.

09:12.767 --> 09:15.273
Always at work. Boring!

09:16.412 --> 09:18.264
We are watching "Pirates of Penzance,"

09:18.289 --> 09:20.316
and we're singing along and...

09:20.341 --> 09:23.445
and we are calling it a party,
and that's that.

09:23.470 --> 09:25.323
No homework tonight.

09:25.348 --> 09:27.131
Can we make popcorn?

09:27.156 --> 09:30.434
I'd love to, but... I lost my glasses.

09:30.459 --> 09:31.808
They're on your head, silly.

Ixnay on the irefay.

- It's pig Latin.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.762
That's not a real language.

10:03.787 --> 10:06.056
Okay, Dean, he doesn't
even know his own name.

10:06.081 --> 10:08.733
Okay, he clearly has dementia,
maybe Alzheimer's.

10:08.772 --> 10:11.216
He's lost. We have to help him
find his way home.

10:11.241 --> 10:12.294
How?

10:12.319 --> 10:13.685
We play along.

10:13.710 --> 10:16.362
Try to help him remember
his name or where he's from.

10:16.387 --> 10:18.206
It's easier for us to be in his reality

10:18.231 --> 10:20.119
than try to drag him into ours.

10:20.144 --> 10:22.053
Okay? So just roll with me
on this, please.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.814
You owe me.

10:25.788 --> 10:27.850
Are you gonna pull the baby card
every time you need something?

10:27.875 --> 10:30.793
Oh. Yeah. Thought that was
our deal, right?

10:39.965 --> 10:41.179
Okay.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.216
Next stop is...

10:44.240 --> 10:47.066
742 Southgate Drive.

10:47.090 --> 10:48.943
Okay. Um...

10:48.967 --> 10:50.541
Now can I ask what we are doing?

10:50.565 --> 10:52.836
Well, you can ask, but I won't tell you.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.234
You know what? Fine.

10:55.258 --> 10:58.779
I don't actually want to know.
I'm keeping too many secrets.

10:58.803 --> 11:00.413
Whose secrets are you keeping?

11:01.827 --> 11:04.549
You can ask, but I won't tell you.

11:07.978 --> 11:09.622
PD's a few minutes out. SWAT's en route.

11:09.646 --> 11:10.839
You handle the perimeter.

11:10.863 --> 11:13.133
Sir, Herrera says there's
a troubled veteran inside.

11:13.157 --> 11:15.074
- I'll talk to him.
- Sir!

11:15.555 --> 11:16.539
Montgomery, Dixon,

11:16.563 --> 11:17.582
disperse this crowd now.

11:17.606 --> 11:18.555
Copy that.

11:18.579 --> 11:20.015
You go left, I go right.

11:20.039 --> 11:21.127
Okay, what? uh, what should I do?

11:21.151 --> 11:22.271
Tell the people to back off.

11:22.295 --> 11:24.352
Try not to sound like a person
who's new at this.

11:25.383 --> 11:26.611
Folks, back up, please.

11:26.635 --> 11:28.070
Back up, back up.

11:28.094 --> 11:29.447
Please keep back.

11:30.562 --> 11:31.859
What do you think you're doing?

11:31.883 --> 11:33.309
Uh, t-treating him.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.526
He could bleed out.

11:34.550 --> 11:36.681
Let him. He's a parasite.

11:36.705 --> 11:38.627
- Whoa! Whoa! Hey!
- Okay, okay, okay.

11:38.651 --> 11:40.990
Whoa! Who the hell are you?
Are you a cop?

11:41.014 --> 11:42.103
Uh, my name's Robert.

11:42.127 --> 11:44.694
I'm not a cop. I'm a firefighter.

11:44.718 --> 11:46.153
Freakishly tall one.

11:46.177 --> 11:48.969
And clearly not very bright.

11:48.993 --> 11:50.950
I'm also a Marine.

11:50.974 --> 11:53.001
Yeah. Well, that explains it.

11:55.128 --> 11:56.737
Nice ink.

11:56.761 --> 11:58.546
You're a jarhead, too, huh?

11:58.570 --> 11:59.935
And a Marine would know

11:59.959 --> 12:03.616
that body armor isn't gonna
protect him from this grenade.

12:03.641 --> 12:05.008
It'll blow your legs off, minimum.

12:05.033 --> 12:07.081
Good. Then we can talk eye-to-eye.

12:08.316 --> 12:09.531
You're a trip, man.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.278
So, what do you want, Bob?

12:12.303 --> 12:15.129
Look, that man right there is hurt.

12:15.154 --> 12:16.869
So are you.

12:16.894 --> 12:19.151
Why don't you let my people
treat your injuries?

12:20.170 --> 12:21.293
How 'bout it?

12:21.317 --> 12:22.996
You do whatever the hell
you want with him,

12:23.020 --> 12:24.699
but nobody's touching me.

12:24.723 --> 12:27.027
There ain't no fixing what I got.

12:27.051 --> 12:28.487
All right.

12:28.511 --> 12:30.212
Go ahead. Get him out of here.

12:31.431 --> 12:32.832
And tell everybody out there

12:32.856 --> 12:35.752
that if one more person
walks into this store,

12:35.776 --> 12:37.199
nobody's walking out.

12:38.356 --> 12:40.245
Two people coming out.

12:40.269 --> 12:42.156
I'm not leaving him alone.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.373
No, he ordered us out.

12:43.397 --> 12:45.581
No, go talk to the police, fill them in.

12:45.605 --> 12:47.319
I'm gonna stay in case he needs backup.

13:04.272 --> 13:07.251
All right! Welcome
to the Chief's office, sir.

13:07.276 --> 13:08.607
You mind if I take your coat for you?

13:08.631 --> 13:09.685
Uh, y-yeah, yeah. All right.

13:09.709 --> 13:11.840
Uh, s-sure, uh...

13:11.864 --> 13:13.265
Help you out here.

13:13.289 --> 13:15.524
Uh, thanks, doll.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.831
Mr. Earl Davis.

13:23.855 --> 13:27.676
Could I, uh, get a-a-a black
coffee, uh, sweetheart?

13:29.393 --> 13:30.759
Oh, Victoria.

13:30.784 --> 13:32.903
Do bring the man some coffee, please.

13:36.763 --> 13:38.442
Mm.

13:39.825 --> 13:42.094
It's hard to find
a good secretary these days.

13:42.119 --> 13:44.737
Hey. How'd you do it?

13:44.762 --> 13:47.066
Uh, what's... what's that, Earl?

13:47.091 --> 13:48.596
Get the top job.

13:48.621 --> 13:51.657
Oh! Well, you know,
put... put in... put in work

13:51.682 --> 13:52.839
and paid my dues and...

13:52.864 --> 13:54.683
A colored Chief?!

13:54.708 --> 13:57.089
Boy! Times have changed!

13:57.113 --> 13:59.070
Yeah. Yeah, Earl.

13:59.095 --> 14:00.287
They... They have.

14:00.311 --> 14:02.256
I, uh, marched with Dr. King, you know.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.029
Oh, yeah?

14:04.053 --> 14:05.696
I got hit in the head a couple of times,

14:05.720 --> 14:08.026
but, hey, you're Chief.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.659
So I guess it worked.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.209
It did, Earl.

14:11.473 --> 14:13.673
Hey, Earl.

14:13.698 --> 14:16.976
Why don't you call your secretary

14:17.001 --> 14:20.591
and, uh, let her know
you're gonna stay for lunch?

14:20.616 --> 14:22.143
Here you go, Earl.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.699
Your phone lines are out.

14:35.281 --> 14:37.829
Dinner's almost ready!

14:37.853 --> 14:39.115
My life is over.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.409
Well, at least it was short and sweet.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.008
I'm serious, Grandma.

14:43.032 --> 14:45.128
A senior in drama club got mono,
and they gave

14:45.152 --> 14:47.282
the lead role to me
with only two days to prepare.

14:47.306 --> 14:49.193
This is a disaster!

14:49.217 --> 14:52.322
Well, what are we talking?
Hindenburg? Titanic?

14:52.346 --> 14:54.094
Chernobyl.

14:54.118 --> 14:55.380
This is definitely

14:55.404 --> 14:58.810
a nuclear-meltdown-of-
epic-proportions type disaster.

14:58.834 --> 15:00.315
Sing one line.

15:00.339 --> 15:01.602
What?! No!

15:01.626 --> 15:04.066
That show is gonna go on
with or without you, Victoria.

15:04.090 --> 15:05.317
And I prefer without.

15:05.341 --> 15:06.672
Well, I say better with.

15:06.696 --> 15:08.828
- One line.
- I don't even know the words.

15:08.852 --> 15:10.288
- What's the show?
- "West Side Story."

15:10.312 --> 15:12.756
Oh, I know that show by heart!

15:12.780 --> 15:15.744
♪ Poor wandering one ♪

15:15.768 --> 15:17.031
Uh, Grandma...

15:17.055 --> 15:18.487
- ♪ Though thou hast surely strayed ♪
- Grandma...

15:18.511 --> 15:19.640
Grandma.

15:19.664 --> 15:21.539
That's "Pirates of Penzance."

15:22.514 --> 15:23.847
Oh.

15:23.871 --> 15:25.966
Well, what show are you doing?

15:25.990 --> 15:27.704
"West Side Story."

15:27.728 --> 15:29.328
Right.

15:29.779 --> 15:31.932
Well... go ahead, then.

15:35.053 --> 15:40.555
♪ There's a place for us ♪

15:40.580 --> 15:45.762
♪ A time and place for us ♪

15:45.787 --> 15:48.926
Oh, honey, you're gonna
bring down the house.

15:52.636 --> 15:54.419
You okay, sir?

15:54.444 --> 15:56.436
Nope. I'm dying.

15:56.461 --> 15:57.897
Sir, you c...

15:57.922 --> 16:00.158
I gotta name it, Warren. I gotta say it.

16:00.183 --> 16:03.031
And I need you
to not pretend it's not true.

16:03.809 --> 16:05.860
- Okay.
- It's not something we say a lot

16:05.885 --> 16:07.783
in our culture. We don't say it out loud.

16:07.808 --> 16:10.007
We don't... own it.

16:10.032 --> 16:13.797
We pretend that death is
this quiet, lurking shadow.

16:13.822 --> 16:15.849
And... And it's not. That's a big lie.

16:15.874 --> 16:17.796
It's loud and obnoxious

16:17.821 --> 16:19.778
and it comes at you guns blazing.

16:19.803 --> 16:22.769
And I don't understand
why we can't just name it,

16:22.794 --> 16:24.457
call it what it is.

16:24.482 --> 16:26.265
- Chad.
- What?

16:26.290 --> 16:28.143
When I was a kid,
there was this neighbor...

16:28.168 --> 16:29.360
you know, Chad.

16:29.385 --> 16:30.752
He was loud and obnoxious

16:30.777 --> 16:32.768
and mean and intentionally hurtful.

16:32.793 --> 16:36.129
If I was gonna give death
a name, it would be Chad.

16:40.733 --> 16:41.960
Just...

16:44.524 --> 16:46.377
To hell with you, Chad.

16:47.445 --> 16:49.784
Yeah. To hell with Chad.

16:52.313 --> 16:53.992
Hey, let's swing by City Hall.

16:54.017 --> 16:57.956
I, uh, got a few things to do
before Chad shows up.

16:57.981 --> 16:58.917
Yeah.

17:02.334 --> 17:05.300
I-I can see it.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.769
Why don't you put that pin
back in the grenade?

17:07.794 --> 17:09.541
Be safe, so we can talk.

17:09.567 --> 17:10.988
Did you even deploy?

17:11.012 --> 17:14.395
Iraq and Afghanistan.

17:14.420 --> 17:15.613
Well, me, too.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.281
Did you actually leave the wire,
or were you

17:17.307 --> 17:20.759
one of those rear-echelon pukes
who hid out at base?

17:20.784 --> 17:22.705
I was a scout/sniper, son.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.314
When I left the wire, I ate cold food.

17:25.339 --> 17:27.470
I slept in my own filth.

17:27.494 --> 17:29.840
I left, didn't come back
for weeks at a time.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.508
All for just one shot
at the very bad people

17:32.533 --> 17:34.699
trying to vaporize you and your pals.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.389
Hard core.

17:36.676 --> 17:37.834
I was just a grunt.

17:37.859 --> 17:39.177
We were all just grunts.

17:40.613 --> 17:42.083
Tell me, Kyle,

17:42.561 --> 17:45.247
why you survive two wars
and want to go out like this.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.326
Traumatic brain injury.

17:46.351 --> 17:48.996
I got blowed up three times by IEDs.

17:49.021 --> 17:50.561
Twice for me.

17:50.586 --> 17:52.613
And I rinsed out what was
left of my friends from Humvees

17:52.638 --> 17:54.368
many more times than that.

17:54.393 --> 17:55.933
Why don't you put that pin back in there?

17:55.958 --> 17:57.693
Let's talk about it.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.820
Gibson says there's explosives inside.

18:01.844 --> 18:04.462
Move this perimeter back now.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.235
We need to sweep the adjacent
structures for people.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.425
On it.
We're going back toward the explosives?

18:08.449 --> 18:09.850
You need to be told twice, Probie?

18:09.874 --> 18:12.050
Bishop! What the hell's going on here?

18:12.074 --> 18:13.544
Sir, there's a suspect inside with his...

18:13.568 --> 18:15.387
No, no, no. I know
what's going on in there.

18:15.411 --> 18:17.472
I'm talking about out here.
This is a police matter.

18:17.496 --> 18:18.897
Sir, I respectfully disagree.

18:18.921 --> 18:20.218
Our people are talking down
the suspect as...

18:20.242 --> 18:21.525
Do you hear yourself?

18:23.106 --> 18:25.410
You're not cops. You're firefighters.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.322
PD has a negotiator standing by.

18:27.347 --> 18:28.644
Swap him out with your people.

18:28.669 --> 18:30.175
Is their negotiator a veteran?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.462
'Cause my guy inside is,

18:31.487 --> 18:33.062
and so is the subject he's dealing with.

18:33.086 --> 18:35.773
I understand that this is
a unique situation,

18:35.798 --> 18:36.956
but we aren't just firefighters.

18:36.981 --> 18:38.278
We are problem solvers.

18:38.303 --> 18:40.039
And we're handling the problem.

18:40.064 --> 18:43.168
SWAT and snipers are about to
arrive, so handle it quickly.

18:50.031 --> 18:52.683
There's counseling, veteran groups.

18:52.707 --> 18:53.795
What about the VA?

18:53.819 --> 18:55.637
They helping with your head?

18:55.661 --> 18:58.001
The VA.

18:58.025 --> 19:03.465
Yeah, I've waited six months
to see a doctor.

19:03.489 --> 19:05.898
Every time I call, it's six more.

19:05.922 --> 19:09.130
Meanwhile, my headaches
are... are... are blinding

19:09.154 --> 19:10.508
a-and I...

19:11.379 --> 19:13.678
I can't remember
what I had for breakfast,

19:13.931 --> 19:15.332
much less dinner the night before.

19:15.357 --> 19:18.043
And... And... And my fuse is so short...

19:19.805 --> 19:22.375
...that my friends
won't even talk to me anymore.

19:23.312 --> 19:25.582
Sounds like you need new friends, Kyle.

19:25.607 --> 19:28.048
Yeah, well, the ones I had were fine.

19:28.073 --> 19:29.566
It's really tough to...

19:31.976 --> 19:34.002
...to leave your tribe behind, Kyle.

19:34.026 --> 19:37.270
Why don't you put the pin back
in the grenade

19:37.294 --> 19:38.661
and call them?

19:39.521 --> 19:41.166
Call them?

19:41.191 --> 19:42.210
Call who?

19:42.235 --> 19:44.087
Call who?!

19:44.112 --> 19:46.647
My tribe is dead!

19:51.988 --> 19:53.460
Herrera, it's Bishop.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.537
I've got Dixon breathing down my neck

19:54.561 --> 19:56.377
and SWAT chomping at the bit to go in.

19:56.402 --> 19:57.873
Negative. It's a bad idea.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.750
Okay, I need your eyes
and ears in there, Herrera,

19:59.774 --> 20:01.140
not your opinions, please.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.878
Sullivan is connecting with him...

20:02.902 --> 20:05.172
better than a dozen cops
with guns will, anyway.

20:05.196 --> 20:06.284
He just needs more time.

20:06.308 --> 20:07.431
How much time?

20:07.455 --> 20:09.203
As much time as you can give him.

20:12.043 --> 20:13.757
See the blotter today?

20:13.781 --> 20:17.719
A couple of boys got collared
for some B&Es over on Fifth.

20:17.743 --> 20:20.048
Uh, yeah, B&Es.

20:20.072 --> 20:21.890
- B&Es?
- Breaking and enterings.

20:21.914 --> 20:22.968
How do you know that?

20:22.992 --> 20:24.462
How do you not... Chief?

20:24.486 --> 20:28.702
I'll tell you,
property crime's gone way up...

20:28.726 --> 20:30.441
- Huh.
- ...since I walked off the beat.

20:30.465 --> 20:32.213
And remember those baseball games

20:32.237 --> 20:34.233
between the fire and the police?

20:34.257 --> 20:36.180
Oh! How can I forget?

20:36.204 --> 20:38.508
Man, were those hose-heads lousy.

20:38.532 --> 20:40.872
Come strutting in the field, you know,

20:40.896 --> 20:43.687
with their sleeves rolled up,
like hooligans.

20:43.711 --> 20:45.947
- Hmm.
- Showing off their muscle.

20:45.971 --> 20:48.957
Huh. Bunch of meatheads, huh, Earl?

20:54.486 --> 20:56.256
Okay, here you go.

20:58.303 --> 20:59.356
Hold on.

20:59.381 --> 21:00.526
Thank you.

21:02.041 --> 21:04.210
You look so nice.

21:05.313 --> 21:07.618
You going somewhere?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.905
Yep.

21:08.930 --> 21:11.999
It's the opening night
of "Pirates of Penzance."

21:12.024 --> 21:14.572
It's your favorite show.

21:14.597 --> 21:16.525
Finally get to play Mabel.

21:17.088 --> 21:19.658
Couldn't have done it without
you. I wish you could come.

21:22.938 --> 21:25.868
You look like somebody I used to know.

21:30.405 --> 21:32.223
Mom and dad are gonna
come pick up their tickets

21:32.248 --> 21:33.684
at some point, okay?

21:33.994 --> 21:35.881
Oh, I'm... I'm giving them
tickets to a s-show?

21:35.906 --> 21:38.002
No. No, no, no, Grandma.

21:38.027 --> 21:39.771
You just rest, okay?

21:39.796 --> 21:42.448
You sure you're gonna
be all right here alone?

21:42.473 --> 21:44.187
O-Of course, dear.

21:44.212 --> 21:45.266
Okay.

21:48.872 --> 21:51.038
But where are you going?

21:54.435 --> 21:56.240
It's the opening night of my show.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.947
Okay, then.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.136
Grandma.

22:14.093 --> 22:15.633
Thank you.

22:15.657 --> 22:16.953
Night.

22:16.977 --> 22:18.448
Good night.

22:35.086 --> 22:37.425
- Bishop, adjacent structures are clear.
- Copy.

22:37.449 --> 22:39.858
Clear any houses behind the
surplus store and return to me.

22:39.882 --> 22:41.422
- Okay, we're on it.
- Return to her?

22:41.446 --> 22:43.159
They said this whole block could explode.

22:43.183 --> 22:44.793
At what point do we save our own lives?

22:44.817 --> 22:45.940
Damn it!

22:45.964 --> 22:47.191
All right, pull yourself together.

22:47.215 --> 22:48.754
I'm trying the best I can.

22:48.778 --> 22:50.283
Well, your best isn't good enough.

22:50.307 --> 22:51.708
I think you're making this personal.

22:51.732 --> 22:52.960
And I think you're used to
being handed things

22:52.984 --> 22:54.490
because your old man's in charge.

22:54.514 --> 22:57.083
It's not personal, Probie.
You're failing at the job.

23:00.895 --> 23:03.374
My buddy Sara sold these here last month

23:03.399 --> 23:05.321
to pay her rent.

23:05.346 --> 23:07.164
Was that the last time you talked to her?

23:07.189 --> 23:08.208
Yeah.

23:08.233 --> 23:10.581
'Cause she killed herself last week.

23:11.095 --> 23:13.922
There was no one there
waving yellow ribbons.

23:16.310 --> 23:19.131
I had this kid in my unit.

23:19.437 --> 23:20.942
Lowry.

23:20.967 --> 23:22.611
One day, he was leading a patrol,

23:22.636 --> 23:24.511
and he got turned around.

23:25.508 --> 23:27.223
He was too proud to admit it.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.766
He took a wrong turn.

23:29.558 --> 23:30.738
Boom.

23:31.908 --> 23:33.031
He die?

23:35.315 --> 23:37.272
No, but two others did.

23:37.297 --> 23:39.346
And Lowry never forgave himself.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.753
A couple months later,
he walked into a port-a-potty

23:42.778 --> 23:44.804
with his rifle and never came out.

23:48.202 --> 23:50.246
Makes your blood boil, doesn't it?

23:50.842 --> 23:51.917
Yeah.

23:53.881 --> 23:56.671
Because Lowry dishonored those
who already lost their lives

23:56.695 --> 23:59.313
by wasting the only one he had.

23:59.337 --> 24:02.299
He let the enemy
take one more from our ranks.

24:02.617 --> 24:05.201
Don't let the enemy win, Kyle.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.287
Stay in the fight.

24:07.312 --> 24:08.817
I'm... I'm ti...

24:08.842 --> 24:11.252
I'm tired of fighting.

24:11.277 --> 24:12.852
I'm tired of the pain.

24:12.877 --> 24:15.229
I just want it to stop.

24:16.167 --> 24:17.430
Then let me help you.

24:17.455 --> 24:18.960
How? How?

24:18.985 --> 24:21.533
What are you gonna do? B-Bulldoze the VA?

24:21.558 --> 24:23.098
You gonna clear this head?

24:25.314 --> 24:26.505
You gonna bring back Sara?

24:26.530 --> 24:28.748
I can't change the past, but...

24:30.199 --> 24:31.274
...I'm here.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.793
Kyle, I'm here.

24:33.817 --> 24:36.156
And I'm listening, all right?

24:36.180 --> 24:37.791
- I'm listening to you, Kyle.
- No. Hey.

25:11.524 --> 25:15.079
So, uh, do those boots really
all belong to dead firefighters?

25:15.103 --> 25:18.139
They represent firefighters.
Don't be so literal.

25:18.163 --> 25:19.946
It's, uh...

25:19.970 --> 25:21.057
It's very poetic.

25:21.081 --> 25:22.379
Well...

25:22.924 --> 25:24.673
Chad's a poet in his spare time.

25:26.643 --> 25:29.330
No, I mean it. He's not
just some loud, obnoxious brute.

25:29.354 --> 25:30.511
He's an artist.

25:30.535 --> 25:32.249
He makes you think about everything,

25:32.273 --> 25:34.786
remember everything, question everything.

25:34.810 --> 25:36.629
He asks you loudly every day,

25:36.653 --> 25:38.749
"What mark do you want
to leave on the world?

25:38.773 --> 25:39.896
What's your true character?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.655
What do you have left to say?"

25:42.997 --> 25:44.363
You sure he's a "he"?

25:44.387 --> 25:45.788
Hmm?

25:45.812 --> 25:47.839
Chad just sounds a lot like my wife.

25:48.906 --> 25:50.376
Yeah.

25:53.004 --> 25:54.440
Bishop!

25:54.464 --> 25:55.935
This is going on too long.

25:55.959 --> 25:57.464
Get my son off this scene right now.

25:57.488 --> 25:59.063
Sir, this is my team.

25:59.087 --> 26:00.070
And that's my kid.

26:00.094 --> 26:01.496
Who works for me.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.824
I understand you think you know
what's best for your child,

26:03.848 --> 26:06.001
but making him watch
from the sidelines is not it.

26:08.637 --> 26:09.933
Sir, what are you doing?

26:09.957 --> 26:11.115
What I should have done already.

26:11.139 --> 26:12.714
Your time's up, Captain Bishop.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.599
Hey, what's going on? We saw SWAT
around back climbing up to the roof.

26:15.623 --> 26:18.502
Chief Dixon, you are
putting my team in danger!

26:18.526 --> 26:20.865
No, Captain Bishop, you did that!

26:20.889 --> 26:22.360
Once SWAT is in position,

26:22.384 --> 26:25.071
PD calls the shots
on going into that store.

26:34.202 --> 26:36.193
All right, stay with me, Kyle.

26:36.217 --> 26:38.757
When was the last time
you felt like yourself?

26:38.782 --> 26:39.835
I...

26:39.860 --> 26:42.095
I was in, uh... in uniform.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.452
Yeah.

26:43.477 --> 26:46.025
Fresh cammies always made me feel like

26:46.050 --> 26:48.111
the man I was supposed to be.

26:48.136 --> 26:49.711
- Like, a-any day.
- Yes.

26:49.736 --> 26:51.728
It didn't matter if it was a good
day or a bad day, you know?

26:51.753 --> 26:52.945
You could lay your head down at night

26:52.970 --> 26:55.136
'cause... 'cause you knew
that you did something

26:55.161 --> 26:56.458
that wasn't just for yourself.

26:56.483 --> 26:57.849
Yeah.

26:57.874 --> 26:59.345
This doesn't have to change.

26:59.370 --> 27:01.327
- It already has.
- Hmm?

27:01.352 --> 27:03.066
People don't see me the same way anymore.

27:03.091 --> 27:06.123
They see this broken, jobless time bomb.

27:06.147 --> 27:09.286
People used to look at me
and... and... and... and smile.

27:09.310 --> 27:11.283
Now they don't even look.

27:11.308 --> 27:12.883
It wasn't the uniform.

27:12.908 --> 27:14.517
It was the person inside.

27:14.542 --> 27:17.113
And that person still exists.
You hear me?

27:18.582 --> 27:20.326
There are so many
different ways to serve, Kyle.

27:20.351 --> 27:21.338
Oh, my... No.

27:21.363 --> 27:22.973
Listen to me.

27:22.998 --> 27:25.998
Cop, teacher, fireman.

27:26.023 --> 27:27.806
It worked for me. All right?

27:27.831 --> 27:28.954
- No.
- Yes.

27:28.979 --> 27:30.003
- No.
- I found another way.

27:30.028 --> 27:31.069
You can do it, too.

27:31.767 --> 27:34.454
Just go, please. Please, just go. Go.

27:34.479 --> 27:36.750
No. I'm not you! I'm not going anywhere!

27:36.775 --> 27:38.801
- I'm not you. Please. Go. Go. Go.
- I'm not going anywhere.

27:39.009 --> 27:40.757
- I'll hold the spoon. I promise.
- Listen to me.

27:40.782 --> 27:42.045
I'm not going anywhere. I promise.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.227
I just want to end the pain.

27:43.252 --> 27:44.792
I'm not going anywhere.

27:44.817 --> 27:45.941
All right?

27:45.966 --> 27:47.735
I'm not gonna let you go out like this.

27:48.736 --> 27:51.701
A Marine doesn't leave
another Marine behind.

27:57.881 --> 27:59.004
What the hell is that?

27:59.029 --> 28:00.742
You been BS'ing me this whole time?

28:00.767 --> 28:02.898
- Kyle, no, no. Kyle. Kyle. Kyle.
- You been stalling for the cops?

28:02.923 --> 28:04.394
I haven't been BS'ing you!

28:04.419 --> 28:06.098
I haven't been BS'ing you, Kyle!

28:10.990 --> 28:12.739
I'm gonna blow this place to hell!

28:12.764 --> 28:13.921
God! No!

28:13.946 --> 28:15.313
Herrera, get out!

28:15.338 --> 28:17.061
Let me go! Please! I just wanna go!

28:17.086 --> 28:18.835
I'm not gonna let you go!

28:18.860 --> 28:20.469
There's got to be something
worth living for.

28:20.494 --> 28:21.800
A parent, a brother?

28:21.825 --> 28:22.935
A girl?

28:23.901 --> 28:25.128
What's her name?

28:25.153 --> 28:26.450
Huh?

28:26.475 --> 28:27.910
A-A-Ashley.

28:27.935 --> 28:29.058
Ashley.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.693
She your girlfriend?

28:30.718 --> 28:32.050
I don't even know anymore.

28:32.075 --> 28:34.228
Well, do you want her to be?

28:35.790 --> 28:37.295
What's holding you back, huh?

28:37.319 --> 28:38.546
I've been lying to her.

28:38.570 --> 28:40.631
About having a job,
about... about my condition...

28:40.655 --> 28:41.905
about everything.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.482
So, you're afraid she'll...

28:43.506 --> 28:44.911
she'll leave if you tell the truth?

28:44.936 --> 28:46.267
She's all I have left, man.

28:46.292 --> 28:47.392
I get it.

28:47.417 --> 28:49.954
I'm scared, too.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.688
I'm scared of all the stuff
no one else can see.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.576
See that woman right there?

28:57.767 --> 28:59.203
That's the woman I love.

28:59.640 --> 29:02.293
But I haven't been honest with her.

29:02.318 --> 29:05.387
I have this chronic nerve condition.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.369
It's a searing pain
that comes out of nowhere

29:07.394 --> 29:08.657
and knocks me off my feet.

29:08.682 --> 29:11.438
I've been self-medicating
to deal with the pain.

29:11.463 --> 29:12.898
And I've kept it from her

29:12.923 --> 29:16.063
because I don't know what's
gonna happen if I come clean.

29:19.544 --> 29:21.779
Don't keep it bottled up, Kyle.

29:22.210 --> 29:24.157
Just... tell Ashley the truth.

29:24.182 --> 29:25.340
Well, what if she leaves me?

29:25.365 --> 29:26.732
What if she doesn't?

29:26.757 --> 29:29.251
What if she stays by your side,

29:29.276 --> 29:32.546
loves and supports you,
and... and helps you?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.598
And what if you come out of it stronger?

29:34.623 --> 29:36.046
Together?

29:37.650 --> 29:39.711
O...

29:39.736 --> 29:41.554
Okay.

29:41.579 --> 29:43.710
Okay.

29:43.735 --> 29:44.788
Okay.

29:44.813 --> 29:46.458
I got you.

29:46.483 --> 29:47.884
I got you.

29:47.909 --> 29:48.996
Okay.

29:51.282 --> 29:52.683
Called every senior home in the city.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.568
Nobody's heard of Earl Davis.

29:55.496 --> 29:57.487
There's got to be something
we can do to help him.

29:57.572 --> 29:58.822
There is.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.867
Grey-Sloan is three blocks away.

30:01.891 --> 30:03.535
We are not gonna dump him
at the hospital.

30:04.477 --> 30:06.121
He's somebody's family.

30:06.146 --> 30:07.812
We don't abandon our family.

30:11.632 --> 30:13.623
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's...

30:13.648 --> 30:15.906
No. That's okay.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.273
You play piano?

30:22.298 --> 30:23.525
I took lessons as a kid.

30:23.550 --> 30:24.743
Oh, right.

30:24.771 --> 30:26.450
After archery
and horseback riding, right?

30:26.475 --> 30:28.136
Yeah, actually.

30:30.443 --> 30:33.221
But, Dean, music could help him.
It could help him remember.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.314
Dean, please.

30:38.339 --> 30:40.331
- Oh, no.
- Just do... Yes.

30:40.356 --> 30:41.618
- I'm calling baby.
- Ooh!

30:41.643 --> 30:43.531
I'm calling baby.

30:43.556 --> 30:45.131
Baby.

30:45.156 --> 30:46.521
Okay.

30:46.546 --> 30:48.109
I'll take it.

30:49.976 --> 30:51.516
All right.

30:51.541 --> 30:54.504
- Like, what am I supposed to...
- Mm. Mm.

30:56.477 --> 30:58.226
Nice.

30:58.251 --> 31:01.737

31:32.334 --> 31:35.300
The truth is right out that door, Kyle.

31:35.325 --> 31:36.900
You just have to walk through it.

31:36.925 --> 31:38.360
I know that.

31:38.385 --> 31:40.343
I can't retreat. I'm not a quitter.

Congrats, Captain Bishop.

33:34.284 --> 33:36.206
You walked into a tough spot,

33:36.230 --> 33:38.626
and you made it look easy walking out.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.554
Well, a Captain's
only as good as their team.

33:46.555 --> 33:48.825
You ever put my son in danger
like that again,

33:48.850 --> 33:50.633
I'll bury you so deep in desk duty,

33:50.658 --> 33:54.306
you'll be pulling splinters
from your ass until Christmas.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.816
You okay?

34:03.970 --> 34:06.310
I didn't realize you were...

34:06.335 --> 34:07.874
dealing with so much.

34:07.899 --> 34:09.056
I get by.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.873
And that's what I'm afraid of.

34:11.899 --> 34:13.264
Look...

34:13.491 --> 34:14.531
I'm fine.

34:16.125 --> 34:18.222
I'm here to help.

34:18.246 --> 34:19.612
You're helping.

34:24.574 --> 34:27.505
Good work, everybody, out there.

34:27.530 --> 34:30.321
I'm so sorry. I just needed a break.

34:30.346 --> 34:32.581
Just one cup of coffee by myself.

34:32.606 --> 34:35.572
I thought you guys
could just... watch him?

34:35.882 --> 34:37.388
I'm sorry.

34:37.413 --> 34:39.661
I get needing a break. I get it.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.331
He gets so angry.

34:41.356 --> 34:43.764
He doesn't know who I am
most of the time.

34:43.789 --> 34:45.478
I try... I really try my hardest,

34:45.504 --> 34:46.905
but I...

34:46.929 --> 34:48.123
I snapped.

34:48.148 --> 34:49.965
I'm sorry.

34:49.989 --> 34:51.286
- Your face.
- Oh, it's fine.

34:51.312 --> 34:52.679
It's fine. It's seen worse.

34:52.704 --> 34:54.139
We'll need to file a report.

34:54.164 --> 34:56.331
No, we won't. We're not...
We're not doing that.

34:56.356 --> 34:57.999
She didn't abandon him, Dean.

34:58.024 --> 34:59.634
She needed a break, and she came back.

34:59.659 --> 35:01.651
I promise I'll never do this again.

35:03.894 --> 35:05.526
Yeah, you can't promise that.

35:07.032 --> 35:08.491
You can't.

35:11.190 --> 35:12.417
You're gonna snap again,

35:12.442 --> 35:14.573
and you're gonna need another break.

35:14.598 --> 35:18.385
This situation...
It gets worse before it stops.

35:19.773 --> 35:20.930
And when it stops,

35:20.955 --> 35:23.330
you will give anything
for the bad times again.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.346
So...

35:25.371 --> 35:27.865
next time, if you need a break,

35:27.890 --> 35:29.695
just give us a heads-up?

35:38.046 --> 35:39.691
You don't want to run toward explosives?

35:39.715 --> 35:41.290
No, that's not what I was saying. I...

35:41.314 --> 35:43.028
Kind of a prerequisite of the job

35:43.052 --> 35:45.043
to want to run toward explosives.

35:45.067 --> 35:47.060
And now Daddy doesn't want us
to put you in danger?

35:47.084 --> 35:48.785
What the hell, Probie?

35:50.147 --> 35:53.043
I was an art history major, Travis.

35:53.068 --> 35:55.373
The fire academy...
that was my father's idea,

35:55.398 --> 35:57.691
and I'm pretty sure it's because
he wants to run for office one day.

35:57.716 --> 35:59.361
People will die... unnecessarily...

35:59.386 --> 36:01.621
because you are doing a job
you are not cut out for

36:01.646 --> 36:03.360
to try and please your daddy.

36:03.385 --> 36:05.329
Sleep on that. I know I couldn't.

36:17.197 --> 36:18.702
Thanks to the Seattle PD...

36:18.726 --> 36:20.232
- Did we miss it?
- What are we watching?

36:20.256 --> 36:21.726
No, just... just... just wait for it.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.014
...and the grenade was safely deployed.

36:23.038 --> 36:24.995
- "Thanks to Seattle PD."
- And in other news,

36:25.019 --> 36:28.089
Fire Chief Michael Dixon
got the boot today...

36:28.113 --> 36:30.939
in the form
of dozens of firefighter boots

36:30.963 --> 36:33.303
placed on the steps of City Hall.

36:33.327 --> 36:35.805
A statement from
a former Seattle firefighter,

36:35.829 --> 36:37.840
- Captain Pruitt Herrera...
- What?!

36:37.865 --> 36:39.142
...says the boots
represent fallen heroes.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.509
Oh, my God! Dad?!

36:40.533 --> 36:42.212
These empty boots
represent the firefighters

36:42.236 --> 36:43.741
we've lost to cancer this year.

36:43.765 --> 36:46.000
I say "represent" because
we didn't have enough boots

36:46.024 --> 36:47.808
to show you the accurate number.

36:47.832 --> 36:50.519
There wasn't enough space on these steps

36:50.543 --> 36:53.404
to show you how many
men and women have died

36:53.428 --> 36:55.350
in the past 12 months due to cancer.

36:55.374 --> 36:57.661
And we aren't covering
their medical bills.

36:57.685 --> 36:59.469
And I ask why.

36:59.493 --> 37:01.345
Why are we failing to help those

37:01.369 --> 37:03.930
who put their lives on the line
to help us?

37:03.954 --> 37:06.038
That was Captain Herrera,

37:06.062 --> 37:08.041
- former Fire Captain of Station 19...
- Whoo!

37:12.155 --> 37:14.113
You're hitting that bag
like it owes you money.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.952
You still sleeping
with other men's wives?

37:18.392 --> 37:19.933
No, I stopped that.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.671
And you don't have to forgive me, man,

37:21.696 --> 37:23.745
'cause I don't even forgive myself.

37:24.672 --> 37:26.455
What are you working out here?

37:26.480 --> 37:27.637
JJ feelings?

37:27.662 --> 37:28.925
It's not okay.

37:28.950 --> 37:30.489
It's not okay

37:30.514 --> 37:34.000
when someone is depending on you
to take care of them,

37:34.025 --> 37:36.017
to love them, to nurture them

37:36.042 --> 37:37.222
and just leave!

37:38.584 --> 37:39.777
It is not...

37:39.802 --> 37:40.959
o...

37:40.984 --> 37:42.559
kay!

37:44.448 --> 37:46.544
You should cry.

37:46.569 --> 37:47.727
What?

37:47.752 --> 37:49.488
Yeah, it'll make you feel better.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.115
I can't just cry.

37:53.216 --> 37:55.625
Well, then... listen to a sad song

37:55.649 --> 37:57.258
or, uh, watch a sad movie.

37:57.282 --> 37:58.892
I don't know. Just... get it out.

37:58.916 --> 38:00.317
Daah! I am!

38:00.341 --> 38:02.368
I'm... I'm hitting this thing.

38:02.392 --> 38:03.793
It's not the same as crying.

38:05.242 --> 38:06.943
So, what, you just cry voluntarily?

38:07.962 --> 38:09.281
Only when I'm sad.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.449
Oh, God!

38:23.474 --> 38:24.701
Ohh!

38:24.726 --> 38:25.848
Wow.

38:25.873 --> 38:27.066
I'm crying.

38:27.091 --> 38:28.354
See?

38:31.023 --> 38:33.049
Quite a show.

38:33.074 --> 38:36.214
Well, Dixon didn't approve. Added bonus.

38:37.769 --> 38:39.100
I, uh...

38:39.125 --> 38:41.777
I can't do this with you anymore, Warren.

38:41.802 --> 38:44.211
I... don't have it in me.

38:44.236 --> 38:46.228
And I don't want to cost you
a life 'cause I can't keep up.

38:46.253 --> 38:49.587
Y-You, uh, need to find a new partner.

38:50.633 --> 38:52.451
Yeah, I hate Chad.

38:53.936 --> 38:56.019
Me, too.

38:57.422 --> 38:59.136
But, um...

38:59.161 --> 39:01.256
listen, you know, uh...

39:01.281 --> 39:02.752
when you meet him

39:02.777 --> 39:05.673
and he... takes you... wherever you go,

39:05.698 --> 39:06.953
uh...

39:07.987 --> 39:10.534
I had a little girl
I never got a chance to meet.

39:10.559 --> 39:13.281
In my head, I call her Danny.

39:14.057 --> 39:16.766
If you see her, I'd, um...

39:18.049 --> 39:20.423
...I'd appreciate it
if you'd give her my love.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.610
You got it, son.

39:25.267 --> 39:26.946
I'm gonna, uh...

39:26.971 --> 39:30.527
I'm gonna miss the superhero suit.

39:35.380 --> 39:37.859
Captain doesn't make the soup.

39:37.884 --> 39:39.389
I miss cooking.

39:42.926 --> 39:45.462
You were an excellent Captain today.

39:45.487 --> 39:46.784
You don't have to say that.

39:46.809 --> 39:48.245
I know.

39:50.425 --> 39:52.440
Well, at least I'll go out on a high.

39:54.556 --> 39:56.339
You can't quit.

39:56.364 --> 39:58.113
If you fail, we all fail.

39:58.138 --> 39:59.469
Every one of us.

39:59.494 --> 40:00.861
What, you think if you step down,

40:00.886 --> 40:04.650
Dixon's gonna let
another woman take your place?

40:04.675 --> 40:06.076
So now I'm responsible

40:06.101 --> 40:09.101
for the future
of all female firefighters?

40:09.126 --> 40:12.126
Well, don't act like
that's a surprise to you.

40:12.151 --> 40:13.748
It is what it is.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.643
You had a rough start,
but look at my dad.

40:17.668 --> 40:18.825
When he made Captain,

40:18.850 --> 40:20.634
his team called him so many racial slurs,

40:20.659 --> 40:22.860
he should have walked
out of these doors on day one.

40:22.885 --> 40:24.665
But he didn't. He stuck it out.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.682
He... He changed people's minds,

40:26.707 --> 40:29.012
and he became legendary.

40:29.037 --> 40:31.272
Everyone hates me.

40:31.297 --> 40:34.448
Everyone's fighting some kind of battle.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.813
This is yours.

40:36.838 --> 40:39.836
And for the record, when I make Captain,

40:39.861 --> 40:42.167
it's not gonna be because
my friend gave me her job.

40:42.192 --> 40:44.497
I'm too proud for that.

40:44.522 --> 40:46.361
And you're too proud for it, too.

40:46.386 --> 40:48.053
I miss you.

40:50.971 --> 40:52.234
I'm sorry I broke us.

40:56.238 --> 40:58.404
I do blame you

40:58.429 --> 41:00.803
for the fact that I live with Jack now.

41:00.828 --> 41:03.549
I mean, he refuses to use Tupperware.

41:03.574 --> 41:05.844
He ju... He just puts a-a plate
over the bowl

41:05.869 --> 41:07.444
and sticks it in the fridge.

41:09.944 --> 41:11.345
I'm so sorry.

41:13.609 --> 41:15.080
You're my tribe, Maya.

41:15.104 --> 41:16.852
We're not all the way through this,

41:16.876 --> 41:19.042
but... we'll get there.

41:19.066 --> 41:20.703
In the meantime,

41:20.727 --> 41:23.908
you go tell Sullivan you're not quitting.

41:23.932 --> 41:25.657
You couldn't have said all this to me

41:25.681 --> 41:28.183
before I made enemies with Dixon?

41:28.207 --> 41:29.800
Ooh! What are we making?

41:29.824 --> 41:30.989
Split pea soup.

41:31.013 --> 41:32.773
That's disgusting.

41:32.797 --> 41:34.339
Don't even... joke about that.

41:34.363 --> 41:35.799
You're not joking.
And why... would you... be?

41:35.823 --> 41:38.464
- I'm pumped about it.
- Why don't you get to work? And then...

41:39.815 --> 41:41.390
You okay, Chief?

41:41.904 --> 41:44.856
I just got a call from Eva Vasquez.

41:44.881 --> 41:47.637
Rigo died this afternoon.

41:47.907 --> 41:49.760
No.

41:49.785 --> 41:51.881
No, sir.

41:51.906 --> 41:54.072
He was getting better. He was going home.

41:54.097 --> 41:55.624
Yeah, he didn't make it home.

41:55.855 --> 41:57.534
He's gone.

42:08.858 --> 42:10.677
There is help for those living with

42:10.702 --> 42:12.306
the invisible wounds of war.
