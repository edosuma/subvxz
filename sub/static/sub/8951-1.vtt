WEBVTT

01:47.504 --> 01:49.088
Little Frank.

01:49.839 --> 01:52.550
- You take care of your ma.
- I will.

01:58.807 --> 02:02.060
- You're not travelling very heavy, Tom.
- I got all I need.

02:07.732 --> 02:11.694
You should be taking the train, Frank.
Fort Smith is too long a ride.

02:11.903 --> 02:15.782
On Judy, 70 miles
will be a pleasant outing.

02:16.866 --> 02:19.577
Yarnell, you'll take care
of the place for me.

02:19.828 --> 02:23.957
You and my Mattie.
Where's Mattie?

02:24.707 --> 02:26.876
I'm here, Papa!

02:31.714 --> 02:35.343
Well, Little Bookkeeper,
got my wherewithal ready?

02:35.552 --> 02:38.638
- Of course.
- How much are you allowing me?

02:38.847 --> 02:41.683
There's... right around...

02:44.436 --> 02:47.188
...$150 cash money there.

02:48.106 --> 02:50.775
Better hand me
my good luck gold pieces, too.

02:51.818 --> 02:56.197
Buying Texas mustang ponies,
you'll need plenty of luck!

02:56.448 --> 03:01.661
You'll come around to my plan.
I intend to buy as many as I can swing.

03:01.870 --> 03:07.834
- We'll breed them for deer-hunting.
- They're small and chicken-brained!

03:08.042 --> 03:12.130
I'd say small and tough,
right for keeping up with dogs.

03:12.338 --> 03:15.508
- You want my advice, Papa?
- I always do.

03:15.758 --> 03:19.179
- Buy the ponies cheap.
- I expect to.

03:19.888 --> 03:24.225
This Colonel Stonehill has got
to get rid of them before winter.

03:24.434 --> 03:28.271
Papa, that gun's old-fashioned.
Buy a new one at Fort Smith.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.901
It served me well at Chickamauga,
and it's got a long way to go yet.

03:45.789 --> 03:47.415
Goodbye, Papa!

03:55.965 --> 03:58.718
Tom Chaney...
Now there's trash for you.

03:58.927 --> 04:01.304
It's his job to look after the place.

04:01.554 --> 04:05.391
Papa took him in when he was starving
and gave him a house.

04:05.600 --> 04:08.978
Come, Mattie, it's only an old tool-shed.

04:09.187 --> 04:12.607
You can still throw a cat
through the south wall!

04:12.816 --> 04:15.026
It's got a good roof.

04:18.947 --> 04:21.281
- This game's crooked!
- What?

04:21.491 --> 04:24.369
You've been dealing me seconds!

04:26.204 --> 04:28.957
Goddamn crooks!
You're stackin' the decks!

04:33.920 --> 04:37.799
Come on, Tom. We want to make
an early start for home.

04:38.007 --> 04:41.970
I'm going back in there.
I want to get my money back!

04:42.178 --> 04:44.389
Not full of whisky and with a gun.
That's no way.

04:44.597 --> 04:50.186
- A gun'll say a whole lot quick.
- I won't allow you to get into trouble.

04:50.437 --> 04:52.856
- Gimme your gun.
- I'll give you one end of it!

04:53.064 --> 04:55.900
Gimme the gun! Gimme your gun!

05:25.388 --> 05:26.931
All aboard!

05:30.727 --> 05:32.520
Where's the undertaker?

05:32.729 --> 05:35.648
Round the corner
from the courthouse, ma'am.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.192
Thank you.

05:43.490 --> 05:45.700
I can't understand
all these people being here.

05:45.909 --> 05:48.912
Everybody comes in from every place.

05:49.120 --> 05:53.541
- I'd like to know why.
- They're hanging three men today.

05:53.708 --> 05:56.920
We'd better go and see about Papa.

06:18.191 --> 06:20.944
GESCHLOSSEN.
BIN BEI DER HINRICHTUNG.

06:21.194 --> 06:25.240
Looks like he's out
rustling up business for himself.

06:25.448 --> 06:31.121
Seems like we have some time
to waste before we see anybody.

06:31.371 --> 06:33.998
I can tell you want to go to the hanging.

06:34.207 --> 06:39.003
Afraid I can't.
Your mama said keep an eye on you.

06:39.754 --> 06:42.173
Well, I'll go along.

06:42.423 --> 06:45.593
Don't worry, I won't tell Mama.

06:49.722 --> 06:54.227
<i>I was once lost</i>

06:54.436 --> 06:58.815
<i>But now am found</i>

06:59.023 --> 07:07.365
<i>Was blind but now I see</i>

07:07.574 --> 07:12.036
<i>'Twas grace that taught</i>

07:12.245 --> 07:16.749
<i>My heart to fear</i>

07:16.958 --> 07:24.883
<i>And grace my fears relieved</i>

07:25.091 --> 07:29.012
<i>How sweet the sound...</i>

07:29.471 --> 07:32.056
That man up there on the porch...

07:36.478 --> 07:39.814
That's Judge Parker.
He watches all the hangings.

07:40.023 --> 07:45.487
- He says it's his sense of duty.
- Who knows what's in a man's heart?

07:47.155 --> 07:52.285
<i>...Amen.</i>

07:59.334 --> 08:01.002
The hangman's a Yankee.

08:01.211 --> 08:06.174
They say he won't spring the trap
on a boy that wore the blue.

08:10.470 --> 08:12.680
No, I'm here, I'll see it all.

08:22.982 --> 08:24.567
My goodness!

08:36.913 --> 08:39.332
That's not a faint-hearted judge.

08:39.582 --> 08:42.836
Chaney'll get his due
before such a judge.

09:06.109 --> 09:09.195
Is that the man?

09:10.822 --> 09:13.533
That is my father.

09:15.368 --> 09:19.831
If you would like to kiss him,
it would be all right.

09:22.917 --> 09:24.752
No...

09:28.506 --> 09:30.884
Put the lid on it.

10:23.186 --> 10:26.981
I'm Mattie Ross
of Dardanelle in Yell County.

10:27.148 --> 10:31.945
And this is my friend, Yarnell
Pointdexter, who works on our place.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.948
Yes, ma'am. State your business.

10:35.156 --> 10:39.285
My father was killed in Fort Smith
by a coward named Tom Chaney.

10:39.494 --> 10:41.538
What are you doing
about the murder?

10:41.788 --> 10:45.959
We do know this: His name's
Chambers, he's in Indian territory.

10:46.167 --> 10:51.256
We think he robbed a mail hack
Tuesday down on the Poteau River.

10:51.464 --> 10:54.259
He's medium height,
with a black mark on his cheek.

10:54.467 --> 10:58.763
That's Tom Chaney.
There's no Chambers to it.

10:58.972 --> 11:03.476
He got that black mark
when a man fired a pistol in his face.

11:05.562 --> 11:10.984
- Why aren't you out looking for him?
- I've no authority in the Indian Nation.

11:11.192 --> 11:14.195
He's now the business
of the US Marshal.

11:14.446 --> 11:21.077
- Who's the best marshal they have?
- Bill Waters is the best tracker.

11:21.286 --> 11:26.207
The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn,
double-tough, knows no fear.

11:26.374 --> 11:30.336
L T Quinn is the straightest.
He brings them in alive.

11:30.545 --> 11:35.550
- Where would I find this Rooster?
- At the Federal Court this afternoon.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.052
He's bringing in prisoners
from the territory.

11:38.261 --> 11:43.308
- Is Chaney one of them?
- I don't know. That's federal business.

11:43.767 --> 11:49.439
Your father's gun...
you'll want to take it home, I expect.

11:49.647 --> 11:53.777
His saddle is
at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn,

11:53.943 --> 11:58.364
and the rest of his things are
at the Monarch boarding house.

11:58.573 --> 12:03.036
I won't rest till Tom Chaney's
barking in hell!

12:09.626 --> 12:11.169
Yarnell...

12:12.879 --> 12:14.964
You stay with Papa.

12:15.173 --> 12:19.511
When you get home, put him
in a better coffin with Mason's apron.

12:19.719 --> 12:21.554
Your mama wants you home.

12:21.763 --> 12:29.062
Mama knows I can take care of myself.
Tell her not to sign anything till I return.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.773
People'll take it wrong
that I leave this to you,

12:31.981 --> 12:34.192
but I got Papa's business to see to.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.362
Tell Mama I'm staying
at the Monarch boarding house.

12:37.570 --> 12:41.574
I'm going to see
if Tom Chaney's been brought in.

12:41.783 --> 12:44.661
And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.

12:55.213 --> 12:59.342
All right, get outta the way!
Back up!

13:10.854 --> 13:12.355
Stand up!

13:13.273 --> 13:14.816
Come on out!

13:18.987 --> 13:20.572
Move along!

13:20.780 --> 13:22.532
Are the prisoners
from the Indian Territory?

13:22.782 --> 13:26.327
- Yes, ma'am.
- Is one of them Tom Chaney?

13:26.536 --> 13:29.414
Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.

13:29.622 --> 13:34.085
- Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn?
- The big fella with the eye-patch.

13:38.965 --> 13:40.341
Come on!

13:45.180 --> 13:47.223
All right, take it away!

13:47.432 --> 13:51.853
- Mr. Cogburn!
- Wait! Come back here!

13:52.061 --> 13:53.772
Mr. Cogburn!

13:53.980 --> 13:55.857
Come back here!

13:58.735 --> 14:01.029
All right, come on up.

14:01.237 --> 14:05.074
If he thinks I'm put off by a locked door,
he doesn't know me!

14:05.283 --> 14:08.995
- I'll be here when it opens.
- Then you'll be mighty hungry.

14:09.204 --> 14:11.414
Best time to nail him is tomorrow.

14:11.623 --> 14:14.375
He's testifying before Judge Parker.

14:23.384 --> 14:27.305
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your kindness.

14:39.818 --> 14:42.487
Have some more dumplings, dear?

14:44.239 --> 14:47.826
At 25 cents per meal,
I might just as well.

14:50.328 --> 14:52.664
I was hoping you were enjoying them.

14:52.872 --> 14:58.044
They're all right. I can't see 25 cents
in a little flour and grease.

15:06.094 --> 15:09.431
- You're late, Mr. La Boof.
- The French is 'La Boeuf'.

15:09.681 --> 15:12.225
I call it 'La Beef'.

15:18.064 --> 15:21.276
Mr. La Beef came in this evening.

15:22.068 --> 15:23.987
Your spurs, please.

15:24.154 --> 15:27.782
My poor chairs are scratched
enough already.

15:40.462 --> 15:43.256
A right fancy rig, sir.

15:44.549 --> 15:47.093
Watch out
for the chicken and dumplings.

15:47.343 --> 15:50.305
- They'll hurt your eyes.
- How's that?

15:50.513 --> 15:54.517
They'll hurt your eyes
looking for the chicken!

15:55.685 --> 15:58.313
You squirrel-headed bastard!

16:00.648 --> 16:03.151
Howdy. What's your name?

16:05.278 --> 16:10.950
I'd like to go to bed now. But first
I'd like to see my father's traps.

16:20.418 --> 16:25.173
I'll take a guess
and say your name is Mattie Ross.

16:33.807 --> 16:37.811
- Mr. La Beef is a handsome man.
- He needs a bath and a shave.

16:38.019 --> 16:42.023
- He hails from Texas.
- Judge he's proud of his cowlick.

16:42.273 --> 16:46.361
- How did he guess my name?
- He's a good guesser, I guess!

16:48.113 --> 16:51.157
We're short of rooms
on account of the hanging.

16:51.407 --> 16:53.618
You'll sleep in here
with Grandma Turner.

16:53.827 --> 16:58.081
Don't worry about Grandma Turner,
she's used to doubling up.

16:58.289 --> 17:01.376
I take it my rent will be half, then?

17:01.626 --> 17:05.380
These are your father's traps.
The watch and the knife are inside.

17:05.630 --> 17:08.215
Chaney stole his money and his horse.

17:21.771 --> 17:24.648
What do you think
of Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

17:24.858 --> 17:29.487
Rooster Cogburn! I've heard
some terrible things about him!

17:29.696 --> 17:32.574
He loves to pull a cork, I know that!

18:41.935 --> 18:45.438
His Honour, Judge Parker!
All rise!

18:49.275 --> 18:52.153
I'll have a peppermint
to settle my stomach.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.696
Yes, sir.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.711
The United States Court
of the Western District,

19:08.962 --> 19:13.424
having criminal jurisdiction in the Indian
Territory, is now in session.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.678
Is that Judge Parker,
the hanging judge?

19:16.886 --> 19:22.517
He's a tough customer. There's no
appeal except to the President himself!

19:24.894 --> 19:27.647
Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.

19:27.856 --> 19:31.484
Mr. Reuben J Cogburn
will take the stand.

19:39.409 --> 19:42.871
You were sworn this morning,
you're still sworn.

19:43.079 --> 19:45.498
Defence will cross-examine.

19:52.464 --> 19:58.428
Mr. Cogburn, you testified
for the prosecution this morning.

19:58.595 --> 20:03.349
Allow me to summarise what you said.
According to your story...

20:03.558 --> 20:07.520
...C.C. Wharton grabbed a shotgun
and killed Marshal Potter.

20:07.729 --> 20:11.775
Then he turned the gun on you,
and you shot him.

20:12.025 --> 20:16.738
Then the father swung his axe,
and you shot him, too.

20:16.946 --> 20:21.534
The defendant tried to run,
you say, and you also shot him.

20:21.743 --> 20:25.205
Just winged him,
or he wouldn't be here to pay up!

20:25.413 --> 20:28.792
The old man and CC hit the ground dead.

20:29.459 --> 20:33.505
How long have you been
a Deputy Marshal, Mr. Cogburn?

20:33.713 --> 20:36.591
Four years, come March.

20:36.800 --> 20:39.427
How many men have you shot
in that time?

20:39.636 --> 20:42.388
- The prosecution objects!
- Overruled!

20:45.517 --> 20:49.229
How many men have you shot
since becoming a marshal?

20:49.479 --> 20:54.984
- I never shot nobody I didn't have to!
- That's not the question. How many?

20:56.069 --> 20:57.403
Shot or killed?

20:57.612 --> 21:01.449
Let's restrict it to killed,
a more manageable figure!

21:01.658 --> 21:06.246
Well, twelve to fifteen, stopping men
in flight and defending myself.

21:06.454 --> 21:10.875
Twelve to fifteen? So many
you can't keep a specific count.

21:11.126 --> 21:13.670
I have examined the records.

21:13.878 --> 21:18.007
A more accurate figure is available.
Come now, how many?

21:18.675 --> 21:22.053
Counting them two Whartons,
twenty-three.

21:22.303 --> 21:25.056
I felt you'd come to it
with a little effort.

21:25.306 --> 21:30.228
Twenty-three dead men in four years.
That makes about six men a year!

21:30.478 --> 21:35.608
- It's a dangerous business.
- How much more for those you arrest!

21:35.817 --> 21:40.196
Is it not true that
you sprang upon the Whartons

21:40.363 --> 21:42.699
with a deadly six-shot revolver?

21:42.907 --> 21:47.579
- I always try to be ready.
- Was this revolver loaded and cocked?

21:47.829 --> 21:50.790
A gun that's unloaded
ain't good for nothing!

21:50.999 --> 21:53.001
Just answer, if you please.

21:53.209 --> 21:58.548
- The question don't make sense!
- Don't bandy words with counsel.

21:58.756 --> 22:00.508
Yes, sir.

22:00.717 --> 22:03.720
You testified you backed away
from old man Wharton.

22:03.970 --> 22:06.681
- Yes, sir.
- Which direction?

22:06.890 --> 22:10.226
Backward! I always go backward
when I'm backing away!

22:10.435 --> 22:12.645
I appreciate the humour of that remark.

22:12.854 --> 22:16.107
Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot
when you arrived?

22:16.357 --> 22:20.737
More like squatting.
He was stirring the fire under the pot.

22:20.945 --> 22:25.950
- How far did you back away?
- Six, eight steps.

22:26.159 --> 22:30.622
Meaning Wharton advanced the same
distance? Six or eight steps?

22:30.830 --> 22:33.666
- Sixteen feet?
- Something like that.

22:33.875 --> 22:37.879
Then explain why the body was found
by the wash pot,

22:38.087 --> 22:42.008
one arm in the flames,
the sleeve and hand smouldering.

22:42.217 --> 22:47.138
Them hogs!
They may have moved the body.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.475
Hogs, indeed!

22:51.226 --> 22:54.187
Mr. Goudy, do you have
any more questions?

22:54.395 --> 22:58.066
None that I'll get a straight answer to.
I'm finished with him.

22:58.274 --> 23:01.194
You're dismissed, Mr. Cogburn.

23:01.402 --> 23:03.446
Call the next witness!

23:06.282 --> 23:09.619
Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!

23:15.333 --> 23:17.127
Raise your right hand...

23:23.967 --> 23:26.845
- Mr. Rooster Cogburn?
- What is it?

23:27.762 --> 23:31.975
I'd like to talk with you a minute.
They say you're a man with true grit.

23:32.183 --> 23:35.478
What do you want? Speak up!

23:35.728 --> 23:38.440
You've already wrinkled the paper...

23:38.690 --> 23:42.444
It's pretty loose
because your makings are too dry.

23:45.572 --> 23:47.782
I'm looking for Tom Chaney.

23:48.032 --> 23:49.617
Well, who's he?

23:49.868 --> 23:52.704
He shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross.

23:52.954 --> 23:56.249
He's in the Indian Territory.
I need somebody to go after him.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.460
- Who are you?
- Mattie Ross.

23:58.668 --> 24:03.256
My family has 480 acres
of good bottomland in Yell County.

24:03.423 --> 24:06.593
Mother's home looking after
my baby sister and brother.

24:06.801 --> 24:10.263
Why don't you go home
and leave me alone?

24:10.513 --> 24:13.516
They'll need help with the churning!

24:18.646 --> 24:20.148
Mr. Cogburn!

24:25.528 --> 24:29.824
You can get a fugitive warrant
for Chaney and $2 for bringing him in,

24:30.033 --> 24:34.496
plus 10 cents a mile for each of you,
and I'll give you $50 reward!

24:34.746 --> 24:37.081
You've looked into this right smart.

24:37.290 --> 24:39.292
Yes, I mean business.

24:39.501 --> 24:42.545
What have you got in your poke?

24:44.839 --> 24:48.176
By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!

24:48.384 --> 24:52.514
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What are you doing with this pistol?

24:52.722 --> 24:55.642
My father carried it bravely in the war.

24:55.850 --> 24:59.437
I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it
if the law fails.

24:59.646 --> 25:05.735
This'll sure get the job done,
if you can find a fence post to rest it on

25:05.944 --> 25:07.987
while you take aim!

25:09.531 --> 25:13.952
I'm afraid nothing'll be done
about Chaney unless I do it myself.

25:14.160 --> 25:19.374
- I don't think you've got $50.
- After my horse-trading, I'll have it.

25:19.624 --> 25:22.335
Do you know the robber
Lucky Ned Pepper?

25:22.836 --> 25:25.380
I know him... well!

25:25.630 --> 25:30.093
I shot him in the lip last August
over at Winding Stair Mountains.

25:30.301 --> 25:33.930
He was lucky that day,
my shooting was off!

25:34.139 --> 25:36.391
Well, I think Chaney's
tied up with him.

25:36.599 --> 25:39.310
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

25:46.693 --> 25:49.821
- Ned Pepper, huh?
- Yeah...

25:51.698 --> 25:55.326
Baby sister, I don't think
you can get $50.

25:55.577 --> 25:57.912
But I'll take you home
and give you supper.

25:58.163 --> 26:01.958
We'll talk it over, make medicine.
How does that suit you?

26:02.167 --> 26:03.835
Right down to the ground.

26:04.043 --> 26:06.754
I'd like to meet your family.

26:25.482 --> 26:27.734
This is my father, Chen Lee.

26:27.942 --> 26:30.320
And my nephew,
General Sterling Price.

26:46.711 --> 26:48.463
You want more, Missy?

26:48.671 --> 26:51.800
I've had enough,
and enough is as good as a feast.

26:52.967 --> 26:56.513
I've never seen chopsticks work before.

26:56.721 --> 26:58.556
Chopsticks save the fingers.

27:11.152 --> 27:13.947
- Gimme your cup.
- I don't drink coffee, thank you.

27:14.155 --> 27:18.868
- Well, what do you drink?
- I'm partial to cold buttermilk.

27:19.577 --> 27:24.916
Well, we ain't got none of that.
We ain't got no lemonade either.

27:26.376 --> 27:28.294
Let's get to the game.

27:43.852 --> 27:46.020
- My deal?
- Yes, sir.

27:46.271 --> 27:48.648
- What about my proposition?
- Thinking on it.

27:48.857 --> 27:52.569
Sounds like a mighty easy way
to make $50 to me.

27:52.777 --> 27:56.197
Don't crowd me, I'm figuring expenses.

27:57.449 --> 28:01.911
How you can play cards, drink whisky
and think detective at the same time?

28:02.120 --> 28:08.626
Well, if I have to go up against
Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100, I figure.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.795
And 50 in advance.

28:11.004 --> 28:15.467
- You're trying to take advantage of me.
- They're my children's rates!

28:15.717 --> 28:18.636
It isn't going to be easy
smoking old Ned out.

28:18.887 --> 28:21.931
He'll be holed up
down that Indian Nation.

28:23.016 --> 28:25.310
Well, I'm not going
to keep you in whisky!

28:26.603 --> 28:30.023
I don't buy that, I confiscate it!

28:30.231 --> 28:34.402
A touch of it wouldn't do you
any harm against the night air!

28:34.611 --> 28:39.073
It's the real article,
genuine double-rectified bust-head!

28:39.282 --> 28:40.950
Aged in the keg.

28:41.201 --> 28:44.537
I would not put a thief in my mouth
to steal my brains.

28:44.746 --> 28:50.710
Well, sis, my price is $100.
There it is. Want to make medicine?

28:50.919 --> 28:53.463
I will think about your proposition.

28:53.671 --> 28:56.716
You better walk me
over to the boarding house.

28:57.717 --> 29:00.470
You are a lot of trouble.

29:00.678 --> 29:03.681
Wait till I finish this hand.

29:07.060 --> 29:13.024
You can't tell what's in a Chinaman's
mind. That's the way he bests you!

29:14.609 --> 29:15.985
I go.

29:22.909 --> 29:24.953
Scat!

29:27.997 --> 29:29.791
Mr. Rat...

29:30.500 --> 29:35.797
My writ here says you must stop
eating Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.

29:35.964 --> 29:42.345
It's a rat writ, writ for a rat,
and this is lawful service of same.

29:42.929 --> 29:46.474
See, he doesn't pay any attention to me.

29:48.601 --> 29:50.728
Outside is the place for shooting!

29:50.937 --> 29:53.940
I'm serving some papers.

30:14.919 --> 30:17.672
That was your job in the first place!

30:20.592 --> 30:25.221
You can't serve papers
on a rat, baby sister.

30:25.430 --> 30:29.058
You've got to kill him or let him be.

30:29.267 --> 30:32.270
Are you going to drink all of that?

30:33.188 --> 30:35.940
Judge Parker... Old Carpetbagger!

30:36.191 --> 30:40.278
But he knows his rats.
We had a good court...

30:40.487 --> 30:43.406
...until those pettifogging lawyers
moved in.

30:43.615 --> 30:46.868
The ratcatcher's too tough on the rats!

30:47.076 --> 30:49.621
"Give them rats a fair show," they say.

30:49.829 --> 30:53.124
What fair show
did they give old man Potter?

30:53.333 --> 30:56.336
Tell me that. Finer man never lived.

30:56.961 --> 30:59.005
You're useless in this condition.

30:59.214 --> 31:01.508
I'll walk over there by myself.

31:01.716 --> 31:04.385
- You scared of the dark?
- Never!

31:04.594 --> 31:09.057
If I had a big horse-pistol like that,
I wouldn't be scared of the booger man.

31:09.265 --> 31:12.685
I'm not scared of no booger man.

31:20.443 --> 31:22.028
- Sugar?
- No thanks.

31:22.237 --> 31:24.364
- Cream?
- Please.

31:25.156 --> 31:26.616
Just a dab.

31:26.825 --> 31:28.743
Miss Ross!

31:28.952 --> 31:31.412
I'd like some private words with you.

31:32.288 --> 31:36.292
And you I find a sweet distraction,
as most men do.

31:36.501 --> 31:39.587
- Will you excuse us?
- Of course, Mr. La Beef.

31:46.344 --> 31:49.556
What do you want of me?
Who are you?

31:49.764 --> 31:52.642
I'm nobody yet,
but I expect to go high.

31:52.809 --> 31:54.394
How?

31:54.644 --> 31:57.480
To begin with, I expect to marry well.

31:57.730 --> 31:59.858
You have the haircomb for it.

32:00.066 --> 32:04.446
- How did you know my name?
- I saw your mother yesterday.

32:05.488 --> 32:08.032
What business did you have with her?

32:09.409 --> 32:12.662
This. Can you identify
the man in this picture?

32:12.912 --> 32:17.000
That's a likeness of Chaney,
with no black mark on his face.

32:17.167 --> 32:18.668
But that's him.

32:18.877 --> 32:23.381
I'm looking for him, and you are, too.
I know all about your father.

32:23.590 --> 32:25.884
Why didn't you show me this
last night?

32:26.468 --> 32:30.305
I only take one step at a time.
That's why I was given two feet.

32:30.513 --> 32:35.727
His real name is Theron Chelmsford.
He killed a senator in Waco, Texas.

32:35.935 --> 32:38.271
I've been on his trail
almost 4 months.

32:38.521 --> 32:42.150
- You're some kind of law?
- I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.652
I'm working for the family
of the late senator.

32:44.861 --> 32:48.782
Chelmsford, or Chaney,
shot the senator's bird dog.

32:48.990 --> 32:52.786
The senator threatened to whip him,
and Chaney shot him.

32:53.787 --> 32:57.207
Don't worry about Chaney any more.
I aim to have him hanged.

32:57.415 --> 33:01.628
The sheriff told me you were looking
for a man to go after him.

33:01.878 --> 33:05.090
I've already found one for the job,
Rooster Cogburn.

33:05.298 --> 33:09.010
He's the toughest deputy marshal
they have.

33:09.219 --> 33:12.055
Maybe I'll throw in with you
and the federal marshal.

33:12.263 --> 33:15.767
- You'll have to talk to him.
- There's mutual advantage.

33:16.017 --> 33:18.144
He knows the land, and I know Chaney.

33:18.353 --> 33:20.855
It's at least a two-man job
to take him alive.

33:21.106 --> 33:24.067
I must have him alive down to Texas.

33:24.317 --> 33:28.696
We're not taking him back to Texas.
We'll take him to Fort Smith to hang.

33:28.905 --> 33:31.699
- Is it important where he hangs?
- It is to me.

33:31.908 --> 33:37.622
More so to me. There's a lady in Waco
who'd look favourably on me.

33:37.789 --> 33:41.209
A hanging in Texas
would serve just as well.

33:41.459 --> 33:46.589
No! I want Chaney to pay for killing
my father, not for some bird dog!

33:46.798 --> 33:50.844
It won't be for the dog!
It'll be for the senator and your father.

33:51.052 --> 33:52.595
He'll be just as dead.

33:52.846 --> 33:59.144
If I couldn't find Chaney in 4 months,
I would not advise others how to do it!

33:59.352 --> 34:02.355
Earlier I thought
of stealing a kiss from you,

34:02.564 --> 34:06.484
although you are very young
and unattractive to boot!

34:06.693 --> 34:09.987
But now I'd sooner give you
some licks with my belt!

34:10.196 --> 34:13.783
One would be as unpleasant
as the other!

34:13.992 --> 34:16.119
You Texans are ignorant of our ways.

34:16.327 --> 34:19.621
We don't go easy on men
who abuse women and children.

34:19.831 --> 34:23.793
Texan children show more respect
for their elders.

34:24.002 --> 34:29.466
Texans gouge their horses with brutal
spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce!

34:29.674 --> 34:32.510
You'll push that saucy line too far.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.596
I have no regard for you,

34:34.804 --> 34:38.933
but I'm sure you have enough
for yourself to go around!

34:50.195 --> 34:52.864
They are all for sale.

34:53.907 --> 34:56.951
Except those four scrubby ones.

34:57.160 --> 35:02.081
- And... who do they belong to?
- The heirs of the late Frank Ross.

35:02.290 --> 35:06.294
I'm Mattie Ross, and I'd like
to sell you back those ponies.

35:06.503 --> 35:08.213
That's out of the question.

35:09.172 --> 35:13.301
My father bought them for breeding,
but they're all geldings.

35:14.469 --> 35:17.639
- You cannot breed geldings.
- That hardly concerns me.

35:17.847 --> 35:21.726
He bought four ponies for $100,
and there's an end of it.

35:21.935 --> 35:25.230
I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse,
stolen from your barn.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.776
- Take that up with the man who stole it.
- He stole it while it was in your care.

35:29.984 --> 35:32.862
You are responsible.

35:33.071 --> 35:35.990
I admire your sand, but...
I'm not liable.

35:36.199 --> 35:40.078
- I will take it to the law.
- Do as you think best.

35:40.286 --> 35:44.457
We'll see if a widow and three children
can get fair treatment in these courts.

35:44.707 --> 35:50.004
- You have no case.
- Lawyer Daggett may think otherwise.

35:50.213 --> 35:53.383
- You are impudent.
- I do not wish to be, sir.

35:53.591 --> 35:56.386
But I will not be pushed about.

35:57.137 --> 36:00.598
- I'll take it up with my attorney.
- And I with mine.

36:00.807 --> 36:04.519
He and I will make money,
and your lawyer will make money.

36:04.727 --> 36:07.772
And you, Mr. Auctioneer,
will foot the bill!

36:07.981 --> 36:09.816
You're a damned nuisance!

36:10.024 --> 36:15.155
Who is this famous pleader, of whom
I was ignorant 10 minutes ago?

36:15.405 --> 36:20.452
You've heard of the Great Arkansas
River Vicksburg and Gulf Company?

36:20.660 --> 36:22.996
I have done business
with the GAV & G, yes.

36:23.204 --> 36:26.541
My lawyer forced them
into receivership.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.793
They tried to mess with him.

36:31.004 --> 36:33.256
All right, come inside.

36:37.761 --> 36:39.095
Sit down.

36:41.931 --> 36:47.854
I will pay a total of $200
to your father's estate

36:48.062 --> 36:52.776
when I have in my hand
a letter absolving me of all liability

36:53.026 --> 36:54.903
from the beginning
of the world to date!

36:55.153 --> 37:00.950
I want $200 for the horse duty
plus another $100 for the ponies.

37:01.201 --> 37:04.412
The ponies have no part in this.
I won't buy them back.

37:04.621 --> 37:08.833
I'll keep the ponies, and the price
for Judy will be $300.

37:09.042 --> 37:14.798
I wouldn't pay that for Pegasus!
Listen, as I will not bargain further.

37:15.006 --> 37:20.720
I will take the ponies back,
keep your father's saddle for $200.

37:20.929 --> 37:25.016
My lawyer would not wish me
to consider anything under $300.

37:25.225 --> 37:27.393
That's for everything
except the saddle.

37:30.772 --> 37:35.026
I would like to have that in writing,
for what it's worth.

37:35.235 --> 37:40.448
When I have it in my hand,
I'll remit the extortion money.

37:40.615 --> 37:43.660
This is your release.
You'll find it in order.

37:43.910 --> 37:47.122
You had that already written out.

37:48.748 --> 37:51.418
- I'll give you a cheque.
- I prefer cash.

37:58.675 --> 38:01.386
One hundred, two hundred...

38:02.303 --> 38:03.638
...three hundred.

38:11.229 --> 38:14.399
You'll find a buyer
for those ponies very soon.

38:14.607 --> 38:19.654
I have a tentative offer of $10 a head
from the soap works at Little Rock.

38:19.863 --> 38:22.782
Such a shame to render
spirited horseflesh into soap.

38:22.991 --> 38:27.245
- I'm sure the deal will fall through.
- Expect me back for my saddle.

38:27.454 --> 38:29.873
I'm sure I can!

38:32.709 --> 38:34.961
Do you know
a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

38:35.170 --> 38:40.592
Most people know Rooster Cogburn,
and some live to regret it.

38:40.842 --> 38:46.139
I wouldn't be surprised to learn
he's a relative of yours!

38:54.981 --> 38:57.025
- Morning.
- Good morning.

38:58.902 --> 39:04.324
- Where's Mr. Cogburn?
- Sleep late. Very drunk last night.

39:18.630 --> 39:22.467
I've never seen anybody in bed
at 10 AM who wasn't sick.

39:26.221 --> 39:28.389
Coffee.

39:38.691 --> 39:42.195
You ain't such an early bird yourself!

39:42.403 --> 39:45.448
I almost gave up on you,
figured you'd gone home.

39:45.657 --> 39:50.995
- You need more slats in that bed.
- Ain't no slats in it at all.

39:51.246 --> 39:57.085
Some kind of a Chinese rope bed
torture contraption, I'd burn...

39:57.919 --> 40:00.130
You got it! How much is there?

40:00.380 --> 40:01.965
You still game?

40:02.173 --> 40:05.969
I was born game,
and I intend to go out that way.

40:06.177 --> 40:10.932
All right, one understanding:
We leave this afternoon to get him.

40:11.141 --> 40:13.268
- You're not going!
- You misjudge me.

40:13.518 --> 40:19.649
I can't go up against Pepper's gang,
looking after a baby at the same time!

40:19.858 --> 40:24.237
- I'm not a baby.
- There's no hot grub or warm beds.

40:24.446 --> 40:27.490
I've slept out at night before
while hunting coons.

40:27.699 --> 40:31.286
This ain't no coon-hunt.
It's no place for a kid.

40:31.494 --> 40:35.457
- They said that about coon-hunting.
- You'll be calling for Mama!

40:35.665 --> 40:37.459
I've left off crying.

40:37.667 --> 40:42.797
Make up your mind. If you're not
game, I'll find somebody who is.

40:43.047 --> 40:46.134
I know you can drink whisky,
and I saw you kill a rat,

40:46.301 --> 40:50.805
but all the rest has been talk,
and I'm not paying for talk.

40:51.014 --> 40:56.936
- I ought to paddle your rump!
- How do you propose to do that?

40:57.687 --> 41:00.857
If I smelled as bad as you,
I wouldn't live near people!

41:01.065 --> 41:04.360
I've made up a short agreement
between us.

41:04.611 --> 41:05.904
Sign it.

41:06.988 --> 41:08.531
Here's $25.

41:11.326 --> 41:16.873
I'll give you another $25 when we
leave and $50 when the job is done.

41:18.750 --> 41:21.544
We can get started at first light.

41:21.795 --> 41:26.549
We'll cross the ferry and talk
to an informer in the Indian Nation.

41:26.758 --> 41:28.802
He might know something.

41:29.344 --> 41:31.596
I'll be more than ready.

41:35.058 --> 41:37.102
Well, General...

41:38.103 --> 41:40.230
Look what we got.

42:04.963 --> 42:07.257
There's an old saw that says:

42:07.465 --> 42:09.968
"One white foot, buy him,"

42:10.176 --> 42:12.554
"two white feet, try him,"

42:12.804 --> 42:15.265
"three white feet, be on the sly,"

42:15.473 --> 42:18.226
"four white feet, pass him by."

42:20.145 --> 42:22.480
But I don't hold with that.

42:44.711 --> 42:50.759
I just heard that a young girl fell
head first into a fifty-foot well.

42:50.967 --> 42:54.512
I thought perhaps it was you.

42:54.721 --> 42:56.514
No, it was not I.

42:56.723 --> 42:58.892
What do you hear
from the soap man?

42:59.434 --> 43:03.605
- Nothing.
- I'll take one of the ponies.

43:03.813 --> 43:07.859
The black one with the white
stockings. I'll call him Little Blackie.

43:08.067 --> 43:11.696
- What is your offer?
- The market price.

43:11.905 --> 43:14.282
The soap man offered you
$10 a head...

43:14.491 --> 43:19.704
That is a lot price. I paid you
$25 a head only this morning.

43:19.954 --> 43:22.624
- That was the price then.
- Tell me this...

43:23.249 --> 43:26.836
Do you entertain plans
of ever leaving this city?

43:27.087 --> 43:30.465
Yes, I'm off early tomorrow morning
for the Indian Nation.

43:30.673 --> 43:34.302
Marshal Cogburn and I are going
after the murderer Tom Chaney.

43:34.511 --> 43:36.387
Cogburn...

43:36.596 --> 43:40.433
How did you light
on that greasy vagabond?

43:41.101 --> 43:43.394
They say he has grit.

43:43.603 --> 43:47.732
- I wanted a man with grit.
- I suppose he has that.

43:47.941 --> 43:52.487
He's a notorious thumper. Not a man
I would care to share a bed with.

43:52.695 --> 43:56.116
- Nor would I.
- I wouldn't trust him too much.

43:56.324 --> 44:00.578
I paid a token payment. The balance
is paid when the job's done.

44:00.787 --> 44:04.290
It may prove to be
a long, hard journey.

44:04.499 --> 44:07.085
A Christian does not flinch
from these difficulties.

44:07.293 --> 44:13.258
Neither does he rashly court them.
He is not wilful or presumptuous.

44:13.425 --> 44:18.471
- You think I'm wrong?
- I think you are wrong-headed.

44:19.722 --> 44:21.766
I'll pay $12 for that pony...

44:22.851 --> 44:27.981
...if you shoe him for me.
I will not ride a barefoot pony.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.364
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

44:40.034 --> 44:41.703
Howdy!

44:41.911 --> 44:45.457
- What are you doing here?
- Having a chat with the marshal.

44:45.665 --> 44:48.084
Sit down, sis, have some taffy.

44:48.293 --> 44:53.840
This jaybird says
he's on the track of the same man.

44:54.048 --> 44:57.969
I told him we're not interested.
He's gone behind my back.

44:58.803 --> 45:04.309
A fella that carries a big-bore carbine
might come in handy,

45:04.517 --> 45:07.979
if we get jumped
by elephants or buffalo!

45:08.188 --> 45:10.315
We don't need him.

45:10.523 --> 45:12.692
- Everything ready?
- All but the grub.

45:12.942 --> 45:15.111
I must have the wrong man.

45:15.320 --> 45:20.408
- You let little girls hooraw you?
- Mind repeating that, jaybird?

45:20.617 --> 45:22.952
The marshal's working for me.

45:23.203 --> 45:25.246
- How much is she paying you?
- Enough.

45:25.455 --> 45:27.457
Is she paying you $500?

45:29.250 --> 45:30.585
No.

45:30.794 --> 45:34.964
That's what the Governor of Texas
is paying on conviction of Chaney.

45:35.173 --> 45:39.260
$500? Very little for a man
who's killed a senator.

45:39.511 --> 45:42.347
Bibbs was a little senator.

45:42.597 --> 45:44.641
I guess I'll just stick with sis.

45:44.849 --> 45:48.978
The Bibbs family's put up
another $1,500 for Chaney.

45:49.187 --> 45:53.399
- What are the terms?
- Just deliver Chaney, alive or dead.

45:53.650 --> 45:58.279
That's more to my liking.
How will you split up the money?

45:58.488 --> 46:04.035
If we take him alive, I'll split
the $1,500 and keep the state's $500.

46:04.244 --> 46:07.288
If we kill him, I'll give you $500
of the Bibbs' money.

46:07.497 --> 46:10.333
I don't want Chaney
taken back to Texas.

46:10.542 --> 46:14.838
- He wants him punished, so do you.
- I want him to hang for my father.

46:15.088 --> 46:17.924
I don't care about senators in Texas.

46:18.174 --> 46:24.013
You can tell him to his face.
You can make him eat sand.

46:24.264 --> 46:28.768
You can shoot him in the foot,
but first we gotta catch him!

46:28.977 --> 46:33.940
- You can't have it all your own way.
- I've paid for it so I'll have it my way.

46:34.190 --> 46:36.609
I don't understand at all.

46:36.818 --> 46:40.864
She ain't going anyhow.
Go home to your mama.

46:41.072 --> 46:44.409
- I told her she could go.
- No. She'll make trouble.

46:44.659 --> 46:48.997
Maybe I'll catch this Chaney
by myself and take all the money.

46:49.205 --> 46:53.251
You might deliver him,
but I'd see you didn't collect a thing.

46:53.460 --> 46:57.464
- How'd you do that?
- I'd dispute your claim.

46:57.630 --> 46:59.549
Do that, and I'll kill you.

46:59.716 --> 47:03.678
Don't count on shading someone
you don't know, fella.

47:05.138 --> 47:09.934
I ain't seen no one from Texas
I couldn't shade!

47:10.185 --> 47:14.898
La Beef, you cross me and you'd think
a thousand bricks had fell on you.

47:15.106 --> 47:17.567
You'll wish you was back
at the Alamo!

47:17.776 --> 47:22.322
Knock him down, Rooster!
That reward's just La Beef's talk.

47:22.530 --> 47:26.159
I've given you good cash.
He'll cheat you!

47:26.409 --> 47:29.662
A fella's gotta think about himself
sometimes, sister.

47:29.871 --> 47:32.957
We'll get your man,
that's the main thing.

47:33.166 --> 47:37.003
Give me my $25 back. Hand it over!

47:38.713 --> 47:40.757
I spent it.

47:42.675 --> 47:46.679
- You sorry piece of trash.
- I'll get it for you.

47:46.846 --> 47:49.891
If you think you can cheat me,
you're mistaken.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.477
You may well hear from my lawyer!

48:00.276 --> 48:03.196
Lawyer? What lawyer?

48:03.404 --> 48:06.491
Don't worry about him.
Worry about our business at hand.

48:52.078 --> 48:54.080
- Red.
- Morning.

48:54.289 --> 48:58.084
- River looks kind of high.
- It's been raining up-country.

48:58.293 --> 49:04.090
- Who are you looking for this time?
- If I told you, you might tell him.

49:11.681 --> 49:14.851
Well... you're well enough armed.

49:15.059 --> 49:17.395
I'd say, "Tom Chaney, look out!"

49:19.981 --> 49:24.194
Can't you get anything through
your head? You're not going!

49:33.203 --> 49:37.457
Forget about the freight
and take us across.

49:39.292 --> 49:41.544
You're not getting on this ferry!

49:41.795 --> 49:45.131
This is open to the public.
I've paid my 10 cents.

49:45.340 --> 49:48.176
Take this girl to the sheriff.
She's a runaway.

49:48.384 --> 49:51.179
- There's a $50 reward.
- That's a big story!

49:51.387 --> 49:54.849
- Ask the marshal.
- She's a runaway all right.

49:55.100 --> 49:59.145
- Bound to be paper on her.
- They're in this together.

49:59.354 --> 50:04.400
I've got business across the river.
If you stop me, I'll see you in court!

50:04.609 --> 50:07.070
I've got a good lawyer.

50:12.534 --> 50:17.247
- That lawyer again.
- She draws him like a gun!

50:28.675 --> 50:31.136
I will not walk up that hill!

50:31.344 --> 50:34.556
I'm not going to let $50 slide.
Get on that horse.

50:41.312 --> 50:43.440
Wait a minute.

50:43.648 --> 50:45.817
I ought to fix my hat.

51:53.301 --> 51:55.261
By God!

51:55.470 --> 51:57.889
She reminds me of me!

51:58.139 --> 52:01.267
Then we might just not get along.

52:50.024 --> 52:53.319
Well, you were a little slow
getting across.

52:53.528 --> 52:57.907
- I said you weren't going. Go back!
- I'll do no such thing!

52:58.867 --> 53:00.201
La Beef...

53:18.720 --> 53:21.139
Those horses can't get away
from Little Blackie.

53:21.347 --> 53:24.809
They're loaded down
with fat men and iron.

54:10.271 --> 54:13.608
Now we'll see what tune you sing!

54:19.906 --> 54:24.536
- I'll raise welts on you like worms!
- See what good it does you.

54:24.786 --> 54:27.539
You're not hurting me. I'm just mad!

54:27.705 --> 54:33.294
- Are you gonna let him do this?
- I don't believe I will. Drop the switch!

54:34.712 --> 54:37.674
Put it down.
You're enjoying it too much.

54:37.882 --> 54:40.677
I go ahead with what I start.

54:40.885 --> 54:46.182
You do, and it'll be the biggest
mistake you ever made!

54:47.225 --> 54:51.312
You've taken her part all along,
but you ain't doing her no kindness.

54:51.521 --> 54:53.731
Just leave her alone.

55:01.406 --> 55:03.158
This has given me a plan.

55:03.366 --> 55:08.079
When we locate Chaney, we can
jump him this way and knock him out.

55:08.288 --> 55:11.166
Then we can tie him up
and take him back alive.

55:11.374 --> 55:14.878
- What do you think?
- You don't want to know what I think.

55:15.086 --> 55:17.630
Get on your horse.

55:18.256 --> 55:19.758
It's not dinnertime?

55:19.966 --> 55:26.723
Dinnertime'll come and go without
notice on this trip. Get on your horse.

56:13.853 --> 56:16.606
Presbyterian, huh?
Southern or Cumberland?

56:16.815 --> 56:19.567
- Southern.
- My folks are Cumberland.

56:20.485 --> 56:22.529
I was raised in the Episcopal Church.

56:22.695 --> 56:26.032
I figured you
for some kind of kneeler!

56:31.162 --> 56:32.956
What did you learn?

56:33.206 --> 56:37.794
Ned was sighted at McAlester's store
about three days ago.

56:38.002 --> 56:42.298
He goes there from time to time
to see a lewd woman.

56:42.507 --> 56:47.512
A thief named Haze is with him and
a Mexican on a round-bellied pony.

56:47.720 --> 56:53.935
Chaney wasn't seen, but he was in
on that mail hijacking job.

56:54.144 --> 56:55.437
Stew?

57:20.044 --> 57:24.382
- This is worse than a pig trail!
- Shortest way to McAlester's.

57:24.591 --> 57:28.178
- How far is it?
- Around 60 miles.

57:28.386 --> 57:32.056
We'll make 15 today
and get an early start tomorrow.

57:33.057 --> 57:35.310
How do you like this coon-hunt?

57:35.518 --> 57:40.064
Don't be looking around for me.
I'll be right here.

57:44.861 --> 57:47.489
You look like a hog on ice!

57:47.697 --> 57:49.949
The bucket's heavy.

57:50.158 --> 57:52.202
I'm stronger than I look.

57:53.661 --> 57:56.748
- What did you bring to eat?
- Salt.

57:56.956 --> 57:58.291
Red pepper.

57:59.334 --> 58:00.668
Taffy.

58:02.796 --> 58:06.174
- Carry those in your pockets?
- Yeah. Along with...

58:06.382 --> 58:08.885
...cartridges and skinning knife.

58:09.969 --> 58:13.348
- What are those things?
- Corn dodgers.

58:14.140 --> 58:19.729
- How many have you got in there?
- It must be 175.

58:19.938 --> 58:21.731
I can scarcely credit that.

58:21.940 --> 58:27.195
Chen Lee must've thought
it was for a wagonload of marshals.

58:31.116 --> 58:32.700
That tastes like iron.

58:32.909 --> 58:35.662
You're lucky to be
where water's so handy.

58:35.870 --> 58:39.874
I've drunk out of a filthy hoofprint,
and I was glad to get it.

58:40.834 --> 58:45.255
If ever I meet one of you Texans
who ain't drunk from a hoofprint,

58:45.505 --> 58:51.469
I'll shake their hand or
buy them a Daniel Webster cigar!

58:51.719 --> 58:56.766
How long you boys down there
been mounted on sheep?

58:56.933 --> 59:00.937
Have your little joke,
but I'll tell you one thing:

59:01.146 --> 59:06.067
That little fella'll still be running
when your big stud is collapsed.

59:06.276 --> 59:07.610
Sheep!

59:12.824 --> 59:16.536
That fire's a little big
if we're going to pass unnoticed.

59:16.745 --> 59:19.247
Small fire is Ranger policy.

59:20.874 --> 59:24.210
Listen, I have an idea.

59:24.419 --> 59:27.505
I'll tell you the story
of the Midnight Caller.

59:27.714 --> 59:30.633
One of you plays the caller,
I'll tell you what to say,

59:30.842 --> 59:32.886
and I'll play all the other parts.

59:33.094 --> 59:35.889
Fine. Go ahead and tell it.

59:37.515 --> 59:41.352
- I'll tell it if you stop drinking.
- Let it go.

59:41.603 --> 59:45.523
That, baby sister, is no trade.

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:19.015
At least Little Blackie
likes the corn dodgers.

01:00:19.265 --> 01:00:21.559
It's the salt in them.

01:00:28.566 --> 01:00:31.569
We won't get to McAlester's by dark.

01:00:31.778 --> 01:00:35.532
We'd better head
for an empty dugout I know.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:39.869
- We can eat your turkey there.
- How? It's all ripped up.

01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:42.497
Yeah, pretty chewed.

01:00:42.747 --> 01:00:45.125
Too much gun!

01:02:02.535 --> 01:02:05.622
I thought you said it would be empty.

01:02:26.351 --> 01:02:28.645
Who are you? What do you want?

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:32.023
We're looking for a place to sleep.

01:02:32.232 --> 01:02:34.484
There's no room for you here.

01:02:50.708 --> 01:02:53.503
Try that on the chimney.

01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:55.273
I'm a federal officer!
Speak up, who's in there?

01:03:55.482 --> 01:03:58.276
<i>None of your damn business.
Keep riding!</i>

01:03:58.485 --> 01:04:02.280
<i>- Is that Emmett Quincy?
- We don't know Emmett Quincy.</i>

01:04:02.489 --> 01:04:06.868
Emmett, this is Rooster!
I got five more marshals out here.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:10.163
<i>- We got a bucket of coal oil!
- Drink it!</i>

01:04:10.663 --> 01:04:13.041
One more minute
and you're gonna drink it!

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:18.046
Chuck your guns out and
follow them with your hands high!

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:22.967
If that coal oil goes down the chimney,
we'll kill everyone that comes out!

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:26.054
<i>There's no five marshals out there.</i>

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.892
Don't you bet your life on it!

01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:33.144
<i>Moon can't walk, he's hit.</i>

01:04:33.353 --> 01:04:36.606
<i>- Drag him out.
- What papers you got on me?</i>

01:04:36.856 --> 01:04:39.692
I got no papers on you.
You better move!

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:44.280
<i>Tell those others to be careful
with their guns. We're coming out!</i>

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:52.288
Hit the dirt! Belly down!

01:04:52.497 --> 01:04:53.832
Spreadeagle!

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:10.682
I forgot they were there.

01:05:11.015 --> 01:05:13.726
Get inside, both of you.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.531
Wrap that around your leg.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:31.536
Put the horses in the lean-to.

01:05:38.543 --> 01:05:40.754
- Cuff them.
- Get up.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.802
Sit down. Get down there.

01:05:48.052 --> 01:05:50.305
You fellas are way too jumpy.

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:53.433
What have you been up to,
besides stealing stock?

01:05:53.641 --> 01:05:58.605
- You ain't got no papers on us.
- No, but I got some John Does.

01:05:58.813 --> 01:06:01.733
Resisting a federal officer,
that's a year right there!

01:06:01.941 --> 01:06:05.487
- My leg hurts!
- I bet it does, sonny boy.

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:09.532
You sit still
so it won't bleed so bad.

01:06:09.741 --> 01:06:13.912
- When did you last see Pepper?
- I don't remember any Pepper.

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.665
Short, feisty fella, nervous,
with a messed-up lower lip.

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:20.418
That don't bring nobody to mind.
A funny lip?

01:06:20.668 --> 01:06:23.379
It wasn't always like that.
I shot him in it.

01:06:23.588 --> 01:06:25.757
The lower lip?
What was you aiming at?

01:06:25.924 --> 01:06:27.383
His upper lip!

01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:31.638
Ned's got a new boy with him,
a black mark on his face.

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.808
That don't bring nobody
to mind either.

01:06:35.016 --> 01:06:39.270
- You don't know anything, do you?
- If I did, I wouldn't blow.

01:06:39.479 --> 01:06:40.814
How about you?

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:44.484
I always help the law,
if it don't harm my friends.

01:06:45.193 --> 01:06:50.740
Pretty good idea,
otherwise I'll turn you in at Fort Smith.

01:06:50.949 --> 01:06:55.370
By that time your leg'll be swollen up
tighter than Dick's hatband!

01:06:55.537 --> 01:06:57.580
Mortified and they'll cut it off.

01:06:57.789 --> 01:07:02.293
If you live, I'll get you 3 or 4 years
in a penitentiary.

01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:08.550
- You're trying to get at me.
- If you talk, I'll take you to McAlester's.

01:07:08.716 --> 01:07:12.095
They'll get that ball out of your leg,
and I'll give you...

01:07:12.303 --> 01:07:15.390
...2 or 3 days to get out
of the territory.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.892
Moon, I'll do the talking!

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:22.230
Listen to him,
you'll lose your leg or your life.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:27.485
- Quincy ain't hurting.
- He ain't got nothing on us.

01:07:30.822 --> 01:07:35.326
- Been looking around. Six horses.
- What kind of horses?

01:07:35.535 --> 01:07:37.912
Right good mounts. All shod.

01:07:38.163 --> 01:07:41.416
- They're waiting for somebody.
- You don't say!

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:47.088
If you won't talk, you can keep busy.
Cut that up for frying.

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:03.271
What are you looking at?
Who are you?

01:08:03.897 --> 01:08:06.983
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

01:08:07.192 --> 01:08:09.110
What's she doing here?

01:08:09.319 --> 01:08:11.446
She's after the man
that killed her father.

01:08:11.696 --> 01:08:16.743
His name is Chaney, a whisky drinker
like you. It led to killing in the end.

01:08:16.951 --> 01:08:21.413
Answer the marshal's questions,
he'll help you. My lawyer'll help, too.

01:08:21.622 --> 01:08:24.417
Don't jaw with these people, Moon.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:28.546
- I don't like the way you look.
- Talking to me, runt?

01:08:28.755 --> 01:08:31.925
And I don't like the way
you're cutting up that turkey.

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:37.514
- He's making a mess of that turkey!
- Do it right, or you'll eat the feathers.

01:08:37.721 --> 01:08:40.390
I hope you go to jail.

01:08:40.558 --> 01:08:43.603
Shame a kid like Moon losing his leg.

01:08:43.812 --> 01:08:47.064
Too young to be hopping around
on a willow peg.

01:08:47.314 --> 01:08:50.568
Loves to dance too much
and sports.

01:08:50.777 --> 01:08:54.154
- You're trying to get at me again.
- With the truth!

01:08:55.073 --> 01:08:58.158
- We saw Ned two days ago...
- You go on, I'll kill you!

01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:02.497
Quincy, I got to have a doctor.
I'll tell what I know.

01:09:08.711 --> 01:09:12.924
Lord, I'm gonna die! Help me.

01:09:13.133 --> 01:09:15.593
I can't do a thing for you.

01:09:15.844 --> 01:09:19.639
Your partner's killed you,
and I've done for him.

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:24.269
- Don't let the wolves get me!
- I'll see you get buried.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:27.229
Where's Ned Pepper?

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:33.361
They're gonna rob the Katy Flyer.
They're coming here for remounts.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:36.406
See a fella with a powder burn
on his face?

01:09:36.613 --> 01:09:39.200
No. My brother...

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:44.663
...George Garrett, Methodist
circuit rider out of Austin, Texas.

01:09:44.872 --> 01:09:46.916
When's Pepper due here?

01:09:48.877 --> 01:09:53.465
Sell my traps and send
the money to my brother.

01:09:53.673 --> 01:09:55.884
Shall we tell your brother
what happened?

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:59.262
It doesn't matter. He knows.

01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:03.892
I'll meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.394
Don't expect to see Quincy there.

01:10:06.603 --> 01:10:07.979
Quincy?

01:10:09.397 --> 01:10:12.984
He never played me false
until he killed me.

01:10:14.194 --> 01:10:17.280
Let me have a cool drink of water.

01:10:28.249 --> 01:10:32.337
It felt as though I still
had fingers there.

01:10:54.025 --> 01:10:56.069
Let me have that.

01:10:56.361 --> 01:10:59.322
- It's one of Papa's gold pieces.
- You sure?

01:10:59.531 --> 01:11:03.743
It was minted in California.
It's worth over $36.

01:11:03.952 --> 01:11:06.287
Grandpa gave Papa two
when he married.

01:11:06.496 --> 01:11:11.709
- Looks like we're on Chaney's trail.
- At least we're on Ned's.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:16.256
Gimme the key to these cuffs.
Now go saddle the horses.

01:11:16.464 --> 01:11:20.385
Moon said they were coming here.
You aim to run?

01:11:20.593 --> 01:11:25.640
I aim to do what I came here to do.
Saddle the horses.

01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:31.771
Straighten up the place.

01:12:07.474 --> 01:12:10.685
Take your horse
and find a position over there.

01:12:10.935 --> 01:12:13.730
I'll be on this side.
Don't shoot unless I do.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.274
We want them in that dugout.

01:12:16.483 --> 01:12:19.736
I'll shoot the last man in the door
and we'll have them.

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:25.784
- You'll shoot him without a call?
- Then he'll know we're serious.

01:12:25.992 --> 01:12:30.789
I'll holler down after I shoot,
see if anyone wants to be taken alive.

01:12:30.997 --> 01:12:33.374
But when they won't, we'll shoot them!

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:36.503
- I want Chaney alive.
- So does the Governor of Texas.

01:12:36.711 --> 01:12:40.256
All I know is there's a lot of them
and only two of us.

01:12:40.507 --> 01:12:43.343
Why don't I nick Chaney
before he gets inside?

01:12:43.551 --> 01:12:46.805
Any shooting before they get inside,
and they'll break.

01:12:47.013 --> 01:12:49.474
We're apt to come up
with an empty sack.

01:12:49.724 --> 01:12:52.519
All right, but if they break,
I'll nick Chaney.

01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:55.855
If you hit Chaney with your rifle,
you'll kill him!

01:12:56.064 --> 01:12:58.525
- Remember the turkey!
- Yeah.

01:12:58.733 --> 01:13:02.487
You go after Ned,
I'll take care of Chaney.

01:13:02.695 --> 01:13:07.242
- What does Ned look like?
- Short, feisty, doing all the talking.

01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:11.538
- Where does she go?
- I go where Rooster goes.

01:14:13.057 --> 01:14:15.852
Stay here and keep the horses quiet.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:20.899
- I can't see anything from over there.
- You've seen enough killing today.

01:14:21.107 --> 01:14:24.486
I'm not staying by myself.
Wait, I'll get my revolver.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.154
What for?

01:14:26.404 --> 01:14:29.407
So you can shoot your own foot off?

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:05.735
Why do you keep
that one chamber empty?

01:15:05.944 --> 01:15:08.822
So I won't shoot my foot off!

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:16.371
- Corn dodger?
- Light a match and let me see it first.

01:15:16.579 --> 01:15:19.666
- What for?
- Some have got blood on them.

01:15:20.458 --> 01:15:22.502
We ain't lighting no matches.

01:15:23.545 --> 01:15:25.547
I don't want any.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.595
What did you do before this?

01:15:32.804 --> 01:15:36.224
Just about everything...
except keep school.

01:15:36.433 --> 01:15:40.770
- How did you lose your eye?
- It was in the war.

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:44.232
The Lone Jack,
a scrap outside Kansas City.

01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:46.526
What did you do after the war?

01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:53.199
I robbed a paymaster, went to Illinois
and bought an eating place,

01:15:53.408 --> 01:15:55.994
married a grass widow.

01:15:56.661 --> 01:15:58.997
The place had a billiard table.

01:15:59.247 --> 01:16:03.418
- You never told me you had a wife.
- I didn't have her long.

01:16:03.626 --> 01:16:06.212
My friends were a pack of river rats,

01:16:06.379 --> 01:16:09.591
and she didn't crave their society.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:16.264
She upped and left me and went back
to her first husband in Paducah.

01:16:17.724 --> 01:16:22.896
"Goodbye, Reuben," she says,
"the love of decency ain't in you."

01:16:23.104 --> 01:16:28.026
That's a divorced woman
talking for you about decency.

01:16:28.234 --> 01:16:32.530
I told her, "Goodbye, Nola."

01:16:32.781 --> 01:16:36.993
"I hope that bastard
makes you happy this time."

01:16:38.912 --> 01:16:42.082
Did you have any children?

01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:45.919
There was a boy,
Nola took him with her.

01:16:47.545 --> 01:16:50.006
He never liked me anyway.

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:54.677
A clumsier child
you'll never see than Horace.

01:16:54.886 --> 01:16:56.930
I bet he broke forty cups!

01:16:58.431 --> 01:17:01.935
Never did get you
for stealing that money?

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:05.355
- I didn't consider it stealing.
- It didn't belong to you.

01:17:05.563 --> 01:17:10.360
I needed a road stake.
Like that bank in New Mexico.

01:17:10.568 --> 01:17:12.612
I needed a road stake,
and there it was.

01:17:12.821 --> 01:17:16.282
I never robbed no citizen
or took a man's watch!

01:17:16.533 --> 01:17:17.909
It's all stealing.

01:17:18.785 --> 01:17:21.079
That's the position
those New Mexicans took.

01:17:21.287 --> 01:17:23.706
I had to flee for my life!

01:17:23.915 --> 01:17:29.087
Bo was a young colt then, no horse
could run him into the ground.

01:17:29.295 --> 01:17:31.881
When that posse thinned out,

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:36.928
I turned Bo around and,
taking the reins in my teeth,

01:17:37.137 --> 01:17:41.641
charged them boys
firing two Navy Sixes.

01:17:41.891 --> 01:17:45.520
They must have been married men
who loved their families,

01:17:45.728 --> 01:17:49.190
'cause they scattered
and ran for home!

01:17:50.191 --> 01:17:54.487
You don't have any family, do you?
Except Chen Lee and that lazy cat.

01:17:54.696 --> 01:17:59.909
General Price don't belong to me.
Cats don't belong to nobody!

01:18:00.118 --> 01:18:04.622
He just rooms with me.
Course I depend on him...

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.333
Well...

01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:11.504
Baby sister, you better try
and get some sleep.

01:18:11.713 --> 01:18:15.133
I'll wake you up when they get here.

01:18:46.748 --> 01:18:48.124
Shh!

01:18:49.084 --> 01:18:52.670
Looks like Moon was telling the truth.

01:19:39.634 --> 01:19:43.680
- What are they doing?
- Smelling around.

01:19:43.888 --> 01:19:46.141
You see Chaney?

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.187
I can't make out their faces.

01:19:51.396 --> 01:19:54.149
That's Ned Pepper, all right.

01:20:25.346 --> 01:20:28.683
Quincy! Moon!

01:20:28.933 --> 01:20:31.311
That's him hollering.

01:20:31.519 --> 01:20:36.191
That's the original
Mexican Bob with him.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:39.486
- There's more than one?
- There's a younger one.

01:20:39.694 --> 01:20:42.030
But he ain't a patch to this one.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:43.615
Moon!

01:20:45.075 --> 01:20:46.451
Quincy!

01:20:54.834 --> 01:20:56.878
Now he's done it!

01:21:35.959 --> 01:21:37.585
Over here, Ned!

01:21:41.172 --> 01:21:43.216
I'm hit.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:59.232
They don't call him
Lucky Ned Pepper for nothing.

01:21:59.482 --> 01:22:02.610
That man gave his life for him.
He didn't even look back.

01:22:02.819 --> 01:22:06.406
Looking back is a bad habit.

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.284
Well...

01:22:20.587 --> 01:22:22.046
What's your story?

01:22:22.297 --> 01:22:26.634
I was on the move to a better place,
and I heard the first shot.

01:22:26.885 --> 01:22:29.137
More likely asleep!

01:22:30.764 --> 01:22:35.769
- You know who they are?
- The one on the sand spit's Haze.

01:22:42.275 --> 01:22:45.779
The boy? I don't know.

01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:49.157
He's not much older than I am.

01:22:53.995 --> 01:22:56.706
That's nothing but a little scratch.

01:22:58.708 --> 01:23:03.129
That's nothing to do with you.
Go make us some coffee!

01:23:03.338 --> 01:23:07.509
- It won't take long.
- Let it go and go on inside!

01:23:07.759 --> 01:23:11.262
Why are you being so foolish?

01:23:19.354 --> 01:23:23.983
- You're quite a horse-shooter.
- I was trying for Ned Pepper.

01:23:24.192 --> 01:23:27.070
Next time try for the horse
and maybe you'll hit Pepper!

01:23:27.278 --> 01:23:29.489
What are we waiting for?
Let's ride after them.

01:23:29.697 --> 01:23:32.951
I say no. I know
where they're going to earth.

01:23:33.201 --> 01:23:36.538
You can't take men
by watching them run away.

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:39.666
I know this country,
and I know these men.

01:23:39.874 --> 01:23:43.002
We'll take the horses
and the dead into McAlester,

01:23:43.211 --> 01:23:47.549
and I'll put in a claim for any reward
the railroad may offer.

01:23:47.757 --> 01:23:52.220
- You backed up?
- Some... for now.

01:24:12.157 --> 01:24:17.245
- Damn a man that whistles!
- He's keeping his mind off his hand.

01:24:17.454 --> 01:24:19.706
You don't think
very much of me, do you?

01:24:19.914 --> 01:24:23.418
I don't think about you at all,
if you keep quiet.

01:24:23.626 --> 01:24:29.507
I was told that you rode
with Quantrell and that border trash.

01:24:29.716 --> 01:24:33.970
I heard Quantrell and his men weren't
soldiers but murdering thieves.

01:24:34.179 --> 01:24:36.514
I heard the same thing.

01:24:36.723 --> 01:24:39.267
I heard they murdered
women and children.

01:24:39.559 --> 01:24:42.103
I heard that, too,
and it's a damn lie.

01:24:42.771 --> 01:24:45.023
What outfit were you with
during the war?

01:24:45.231 --> 01:24:49.944
- Shreveport, with Kirby Smith.
- I mean what side were you on?

01:24:50.153 --> 01:24:52.822
I served with General Kirby Smith.

01:24:53.031 --> 01:24:55.533
I don't have to hang my head
when I say it.

01:24:55.784 --> 01:24:59.329
Go ahead, make me look
foolish in her eyes.

01:24:59.537 --> 01:25:02.123
You don't need me for that.

01:25:02.332 --> 01:25:04.959
I don't like the way
you make conversation.

01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:08.088
I don't like your conversation
about Captain Quantrell.

01:25:08.296 --> 01:25:12.425
Captain? Captain of what?
A bunch of thieves?

01:25:12.634 --> 01:25:17.305
Young fella, if you're looking
for trouble, I'll accommodate you.

01:25:17.514 --> 01:25:20.183
Otherwise... leave it alone.

01:25:20.391 --> 01:25:22.352
I've been thinking about Pepper.

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.231
Maybe he'd have murdered those two
so they wouldn't inform on him.

01:25:26.439 --> 01:25:28.900
- Ned wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:32.487
He doesn't kill people for no reason.

01:25:32.695 --> 01:25:35.407
Had he a reason, he'd kill them.

01:25:47.377 --> 01:25:51.548
Looks like we might joggle
some of our passengers off.

01:25:51.798 --> 01:25:54.342
Well, they're past hurting.

01:26:15.196 --> 01:26:20.076
- We'll tie up here, if you don't mind?
- Sure, marshal, you've quite a load.

01:26:20.326 --> 01:26:24.622
Yeah... about half the load
I was looking for.

01:26:24.789 --> 01:26:28.168
Go in and meet Mrs. McAlester,
she'll fix some dinner.

01:26:28.418 --> 01:26:31.296
- I want a word with the peace officer.
- I'll go, too.

01:26:31.546 --> 01:26:35.842
I'll tell the wife
to fix something for all of you.

01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:41.598
You go inside, maybe Mrs. McAlester
can fix that poor little hand of yours!

01:26:41.806 --> 01:26:44.851
My poor little hand can keep.

01:27:06.456 --> 01:27:08.875
Rooster! What are you doing here?

01:27:09.125 --> 01:27:10.668
Boots! Gaspargo!

01:27:10.877 --> 01:27:13.630
You're letting that Indian
behind you with a blade?

01:27:13.838 --> 01:27:18.802
- 'Cause I'm an Indian.
- Plenty of scalps on Indian belts!

01:27:19.469 --> 01:27:22.472
If you're after Ned Pepper,
you're on a cold trail here.

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.477
We're looking for another man, too.
Black mark on his face.

01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:32.524
- We think he's running with Ned.
- That's a Texan peace officer!

01:27:32.732 --> 01:27:34.818
Ned passed through
a couple of days ago.

01:27:35.026 --> 01:27:38.321
Him, Haze, Mexican Bob.
Only those three were seen.

01:27:38.571 --> 01:27:43.660
- I know where Ned's holed up.
- You'll need 100 marshals to get him!

01:27:43.868 --> 01:27:46.413
My name is Mattie Ross
from Yell County.

01:27:46.621 --> 01:27:50.959
That man with the black mark
killed my father. He's called Chaney.

01:27:51.167 --> 01:27:55.463
I got Haze and some youngster
outside with Moon and Quincy.

01:27:55.672 --> 01:27:58.258
I want you to bury 'em for me.
I'm in a hurry.

01:27:58.508 --> 01:28:00.385
They're dead?

01:28:00.593 --> 01:28:04.931
I wouldn't want you to bury them
if they weren't!

01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:09.894
- What about La Beef's hand?
- Gaspargo's a good doctor, too.

01:28:10.145 --> 01:28:12.439
- Take care of it.
- It can wait.

01:28:12.647 --> 01:28:17.819
- You're no good use if handicapped.
- And small use if he ain't!

01:28:20.113 --> 01:28:21.865
- Wash first.
- Why?

01:28:22.073 --> 01:28:25.577
- Don't you wash before you eat?
- Ain't gonna eat his hand.

01:28:25.785 --> 01:28:28.580
- Don't you know about germs?
- No...

01:28:28.788 --> 01:28:32.417
Go wash, Gaspargo.
You lost!

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:46.264
That's Moon.

01:28:51.936 --> 01:28:53.980
Quincy.

01:28:56.983 --> 01:29:00.695
Haze! First time he ever stayed shot!

01:29:05.241 --> 01:29:09.704
I know this boy. Billy Walsh.
Comes from a good family.

01:29:09.913 --> 01:29:14.334
Hold good Billy for his folks
and bury the rest of them.

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:18.129
I'll post their names. If anyone
wants them, they can dig them up.

01:29:18.379 --> 01:29:24.260
Sell their horses, coats, guns
and saddles, and I'll split it with you.

01:29:24.511 --> 01:29:27.680
You told Moon
you'd send money to his brother.

01:29:27.889 --> 01:29:33.478
- I forget where to send it.
- The Methodist church, Austin.

01:29:33.728 --> 01:29:36.815
Are you sure it was Austin
and not Dallas?

01:29:37.023 --> 01:29:39.484
You know it was Austin!

01:29:40.068 --> 01:29:41.945
Write it out for the captain.

01:29:42.153 --> 01:29:46.533
Boots, send this man $10
and tell him he's buried here.

01:29:46.741 --> 01:29:50.453
I'll do that. So this man shot
Ned Pepper's horse?

01:29:50.662 --> 01:29:55.125
Yeah, this is the famous
horse-killer from El Paso!

01:29:55.333 --> 01:29:59.671
He believes in putting everybody
afoot. Less mischief that way.

01:29:59.879 --> 01:30:01.840
Fewer horses, fewer horse-thieves!

01:30:02.048 --> 01:30:04.050
How's your hand?

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:06.553
Both rifle and hand
are ready to shoot again.

01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:09.180
Straighter than before, I hope!

01:30:09.431 --> 01:30:11.141
Well, sister!

01:30:11.391 --> 01:30:14.144
The time has come
for me to ride hard and fast.

01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:18.523
You stay here with the McAlesters,
and I'll be back soon with Chaney.

01:30:18.732 --> 01:30:21.651
- You can't get shed of me.
- She's come this far.

01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:25.029
- It's far enough.
- I won't quit when we're so close.

01:30:25.238 --> 01:30:29.451
There's something in what
she's saying. She's won her spurs.

01:30:29.701 --> 01:30:31.786
Let it go. I've said my piece.

01:30:31.995 --> 01:30:36.458
- No more talk of "winning spurs"!
- I'm going.

01:30:36.666 --> 01:30:39.794
Not because you say I can or can't.

01:30:40.003 --> 01:30:43.339
I paid good money to be here,
and I'm on my own business.

01:30:43.548 --> 01:30:47.218
We'll have no more talk about it!

01:30:47.427 --> 01:30:49.804
Let's eat!

01:31:31.096 --> 01:31:33.139
What are you doing?

01:31:34.057 --> 01:31:36.601
Looking for a sign.

01:31:36.851 --> 01:31:38.853
You couldn't see it if you saw it!

01:31:40.605 --> 01:31:42.649
We'll walk a ways.

01:32:19.352 --> 01:32:22.272
You looking for a sign again?

01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:25.358
It was Bo.

01:32:25.567 --> 01:32:27.777
He put his foot wrong.

01:32:27.986 --> 01:32:30.029
He's tired.

01:32:32.490 --> 01:32:35.326
This is no grade.

01:32:35.535 --> 01:32:40.832
I've freighted iron stoves up
harder grades than this.

01:32:49.424 --> 01:32:51.301
We'll camp here.

01:32:59.517 --> 01:33:01.519
Here...

01:33:08.902 --> 01:33:15.325
I was a pretty fair hand with a jerk-line
when I was freighting in Colorado.

01:33:17.035 --> 01:33:22.832
I worked for a fella that was
always down with something.

01:33:26.127 --> 01:33:32.008
He was carrying a 21-foot tapeworm
with his business responsibilities.

01:33:32.175 --> 01:33:37.555
That aged him!
His wife commenced running things.

01:33:37.764 --> 01:33:42.685
I wasn't about to work for her,
so I told her so.

01:33:44.437 --> 01:33:47.440
Women have no generosity.

01:33:47.649 --> 01:33:51.694
Lord God, how they hate to pay up!

01:33:53.822 --> 01:33:58.785
A man will never work for a woman
unless he's got clabber for brains!

01:33:58.993 --> 01:34:01.162
What about the $25 I paid you?

01:34:03.498 --> 01:34:05.417
What $25?

01:34:05.667 --> 01:34:09.212
I will not bandy words with a drunkard!

01:34:09.421 --> 01:34:13.383
That's real smart. You've done
nothing when you've bested a fool.

01:34:16.261 --> 01:34:20.932
We have come nearly 50 miles
from McAlester's.

01:34:21.141 --> 01:34:24.018
We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.

01:34:24.185 --> 01:34:27.147
Tomorrow we'll take him.

01:35:05.226 --> 01:35:09.230
If we're as close as you say,
I don't think you should make a fire.

01:35:09.439 --> 01:35:12.275
Nobody asked you.

01:35:12.484 --> 01:35:14.069
Where are you going
with that canteen?

01:35:14.235 --> 01:35:16.362
Wash the sleep off me.

01:35:16.571 --> 01:35:20.075
We got no water to spare for that.
Just take a drink!

01:35:21.242 --> 01:35:23.953
I'd say there's a stream down below.

01:35:28.291 --> 01:35:30.919
You wash and you'll get no breakfast!

01:35:31.169 --> 01:35:33.838
We'll waste no more time.

01:35:34.089 --> 01:35:36.091
Shouldn't one of us go down with her?

01:35:36.341 --> 01:35:38.384
It might not be safe.

01:35:38.593 --> 01:35:41.679
It's safer for her
than whatever she meets...

01:35:41.846 --> 01:35:43.848
...man or beast!

01:36:48.204 --> 01:36:51.666
I know you. Little Mattie.

01:36:52.709 --> 01:36:55.003
And I know you, Tom Chaney.

01:36:55.211 --> 01:36:59.466
What are you doing? There's
no money for you to squeeze here.

01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:04.179
- I came to fetch water.
- That was not my meaning.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:13.563
I'm here to take you back
to Fort Smith and hang you.

01:37:13.772 --> 01:37:16.733
I won't go.
How do you like that?

01:37:17.984 --> 01:37:21.613
There's a posse of officers
up the hill that'll force you to go.

01:37:21.821 --> 01:37:26.868
- How many officers?
- I'd say 50, and they mean business.

01:37:27.118 --> 01:37:29.954
So you just walk
right in front of me up that hill.

01:37:30.705 --> 01:37:34.834
I think I'll oblige
those officers to come after me.

01:37:35.043 --> 01:37:37.837
If you refuse, I'll have to shoot you.

01:37:38.338 --> 01:37:40.465
Is that so?

01:37:40.673 --> 01:37:42.717
You'd better cock your piece.

01:37:45.595 --> 01:37:48.348
All the way back until it locks.

01:37:49.891 --> 01:37:51.935
I know how to do it.

01:37:52.644 --> 01:37:56.022
You're saying you won't go
with me of your own free will?

01:37:57.273 --> 01:38:01.569
You just got it the other way around.
Now you follow me!

01:38:11.121 --> 01:38:14.791
- I didn't think you'd do it.
- Sis!

01:38:14.999 --> 01:38:19.254
- Where are you?
- I'm down here. I got Chaney!

01:38:20.255 --> 01:38:23.383
I just didn't think you'd do it!

01:38:24.217 --> 01:38:26.344
One of my short ribs is broken!

01:38:26.553 --> 01:38:30.181
You killed my father,
when he was trying to help you.

01:38:30.432 --> 01:38:32.475
You're just a piece of trash.

01:38:32.684 --> 01:38:37.147
You also killed a senator in Texas,
when he was sitting on a porch swing.

01:38:37.814 --> 01:38:41.234
Everything happens to me.
And now I'm shot by a child!

01:38:41.484 --> 01:38:44.195
I'll shoot you again if you don't get up!

01:38:44.404 --> 01:38:47.782
My father took you in
when you were hungry.

01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:05.341
Little busybody! I'll teach you
a lesson you'll never forget.

01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:07.635
Sis! Sis!

01:39:08.178 --> 01:39:10.013
Hurry up! Down here!

01:39:16.686 --> 01:39:18.730
Take her and go!

01:39:37.499 --> 01:39:39.626
Up the hill with the horses
and don't stop!

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.796
Who holds out there?

01:39:42.962 --> 01:39:46.758
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and fifty other armed officers.

01:39:46.966 --> 01:39:50.386
Tell me another lie
and I'll stove in your head!

01:39:53.223 --> 01:39:55.850
The truth! Who's out there?

01:39:56.059 --> 01:39:59.854
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and a Texas Ranger.

01:40:04.984 --> 01:40:06.403
<i>Rooster!</i>

01:40:06.611 --> 01:40:08.613
<i>Rooster, can you hear me?</i>

01:40:08.822 --> 01:40:13.660
You better answer or I'll kill this girl!
You know I'll do it!

01:40:13.868 --> 01:40:15.912
<i>You want me to kill her?</i>

01:40:17.247 --> 01:40:19.707
Do what you think is best, Ned!

01:40:19.916 --> 01:40:21.292
Why, you...

01:40:24.879 --> 01:40:28.383
She's nothing to me!
Nothing but a runaway!

01:40:28.591 --> 01:40:31.344
You and that ranger
get moving double fast!

01:40:31.594 --> 01:40:35.890
If I see you riding over
that north ridge, I'll spare the girl.

01:40:36.099 --> 01:40:37.767
You got five minutes!

01:40:38.643 --> 01:40:42.856
- We'll need more than five minutes.
- I won't give you any more.

01:40:44.691 --> 01:40:48.737
There'll be a party of marshals
coming soon.

01:40:48.945 --> 01:40:54.200
You give me Tom Chaney,
and I'll mislead them for six hours.

01:40:54.409 --> 01:40:57.287
Throw in that spitfire of a girl, too.

01:40:57.495 --> 01:40:59.539
Too thin, Rooster, too thin!

01:41:00.123 --> 01:41:02.208
I won't trust you.

01:41:02.417 --> 01:41:05.211
Your five minutes are running.
You better move!

01:41:06.212 --> 01:41:10.800
All right, we're moving,
but we need more than five minutes.

01:41:14.721 --> 01:41:20.518
I never busted a cap on a woman
or nobody under sixteen. But I'll do it.

01:41:21.227 --> 01:41:23.480
I'm Mattie Ross of Yell County.

01:41:23.688 --> 01:41:27.525
My family has property.
Why am I being treated like this?

01:41:27.734 --> 01:41:32.906
Well, it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.

01:41:37.285 --> 01:41:40.830
I saw you shot.
Where are your wounds?

01:41:41.039 --> 01:41:44.751
My wounds heal by themselves
from inside.

01:41:46.795 --> 01:41:51.174
You and Harold stay here,
keep a watch out below.

01:41:51.382 --> 01:41:56.471
Keep this turkeycock quiet
or we'll have him for supper.

01:41:56.679 --> 01:41:59.307
Why don't you shut up?!

01:42:03.853 --> 01:42:05.480
Is he simple-minded?

01:42:05.688 --> 01:42:08.441
They're all touched,
but Harold's the worst.

01:42:08.608 --> 01:42:13.113
No, their ma's the worst, then
his brother. But they're all good shots.

01:42:37.595 --> 01:42:38.972
Get down!

01:42:39.848 --> 01:42:41.933
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

01:42:42.142 --> 01:42:45.478
No, you won't.
Go and get those horses saddled!

01:42:45.687 --> 01:42:49.399
Lend him a hand.
You sit there and be still.

01:43:01.661 --> 01:43:03.705
Your five minutes is up,
they better show.

01:43:03.913 --> 01:43:08.585
- What are you doing here?
- Chaney shot my father to death.

01:43:08.793 --> 01:43:10.962
I was told Rooster Cogburn has grit.

01:43:11.171 --> 01:43:14.549
I hired him to go after the murderer.
I shot him myself.

01:43:14.758 --> 01:43:18.970
If I'd killed him, I wouldn't be
in this fix. My gun misfired.

01:43:19.137 --> 01:43:21.097
Well, they will do it.

01:43:21.306 --> 01:43:24.350
Most girls like to play pretties,
but you like guns.

01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:28.354
If I did, I'd have one that worked.

01:43:28.563 --> 01:43:31.733
I'll give them a little more time.

01:43:31.941 --> 01:43:35.403
- Did Rooster waylay us last night?
- Yes.

01:43:35.904 --> 01:43:40.116
- Did he take Quincy and Moon?
- They're both dead.

01:43:40.325 --> 01:43:44.079
It was terrible to see.
Do you need a good lawyer?

01:43:44.287 --> 01:43:46.748
I need a good judge.

01:43:46.998 --> 01:43:51.377
That man called Haze, he's dead, too.
And the boy that saved your life.

01:43:51.586 --> 01:43:56.549
I'm happy he did what he did, but
he should've looked out for himself.

01:43:56.758 --> 01:43:59.719
That goes for your good friend,
Rooster.

01:43:59.928 --> 01:44:02.138
<i>Hey, Ned!</i>

01:44:43.805 --> 01:44:46.599
Rooster Cogburn
is no good friend of mine.

01:44:46.808 --> 01:44:49.102
He's a drunken, gabbing fool.

01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:54.315
He led us right into your hands
and left me with a gang of cut-throats.

01:44:54.524 --> 01:44:56.901
They call that grit in Fort Smith?

01:44:57.110 --> 01:45:00.905
We call it something else
in Yell County.

01:45:07.162 --> 01:45:10.248
I was shot from ambush
by one of those officers.

01:45:10.498 --> 01:45:13.251
How can you tell a big story like that?

01:45:13.418 --> 01:45:17.672
We're five men and four horses.
Chaney stays. You lost the horse.

01:45:17.881 --> 01:45:20.633
I'll send someone to get you
with a fresh mount.

01:45:20.842 --> 01:45:23.219
I'm not staying with Chaney.

01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:25.638
He won't harm you. Understand?

01:45:25.889 --> 01:45:30.435
Rooster gave us six hours
if we keep her safe. If you don't...

01:45:30.602 --> 01:45:32.687
...you don't get paid!

01:45:32.937 --> 01:45:35.231
- Let me ride with you, Farrell.
- No!

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.567
- How about you, Bob?
- No!

01:45:37.776 --> 01:45:40.028
- Harold?
- Cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:45:40.236 --> 01:45:45.366
- Do it again, Harold! Do a goat!
- Baa! Baa!

01:45:50.163 --> 01:45:53.541
We'll see you tonight at Maw's.

01:46:12.394 --> 01:46:16.272
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting water to wash my hands.

01:46:16.481 --> 01:46:18.733
A little smut won't hurt you.

01:46:18.942 --> 01:46:22.404
True. Or else you lot
would surely be dead!

01:46:22.612 --> 01:46:24.572
Don't provoke me.

01:46:24.823 --> 01:46:29.953
There's rattlesnakes in that pit,
and I'll throw you in it!

01:47:00.442 --> 01:47:06.322
Ned Pepper said if you molest me,
he'll not pay you. He's your boss.

01:47:06.573 --> 01:47:11.035
He's no idea of paying me.
He left me knowing I'd be caught.

01:47:11.244 --> 01:47:15.957
If you let me go now,
I'll keep silent about you for two days.

01:47:16.166 --> 01:47:19.419
I can do better.
I can shut you up forever!

01:47:29.888 --> 01:47:32.390
All right, Chaney. That's enough.

01:47:33.641 --> 01:47:35.685
Get your hands up.

01:47:45.737 --> 01:47:48.448
- Get over there.
- Everything's against me.

01:47:48.656 --> 01:47:51.493
- You hurt, Mattie?
- I'm the one that's hurt!

01:47:51.701 --> 01:47:56.081
- Where's Rooster?
- Below, in a place we can watch.

01:47:56.289 --> 01:48:00.043
- Where's Little Blackie?
- Rooster's got him.

01:48:00.251 --> 01:48:03.463
Get over there and stay over there.

01:48:06.966 --> 01:48:11.262
Watch out, he said
there are snakes in that hole.

01:48:50.218 --> 01:48:51.845
Where's the girl?

01:48:52.679 --> 01:48:56.558
In wonderful health the last I saw her.
I don't know now.

01:48:56.766 --> 01:48:59.477
Answer for her now. Where is she?

01:48:59.728 --> 01:49:02.397
Rooster! Make a run for it!

01:49:02.647 --> 01:49:05.483
I got Mattie. Chaney, too!

01:49:07.777 --> 01:49:11.072
Will you give us the road?
I have business elsewhere.

01:49:12.574 --> 01:49:16.286
Farrell, you and your brother
stand clear.

01:49:16.494 --> 01:49:20.582
I got no interest in you today.
Stand clear, you won't get hurt.

01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:24.169
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

01:49:24.377 --> 01:49:28.173
You think one on four's a dogfall?

01:49:30.216 --> 01:49:32.886
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned.

01:49:33.094 --> 01:49:38.850
Or see you hanged at Judge Parker's
convenience. Which will it be?

01:49:39.059 --> 01:49:44.439
I call that bold talk
for a one-eyed fat man!

01:49:44.647 --> 01:49:47.692
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

01:49:55.325 --> 01:49:58.244
- Shoot them!
- Too far, moving too fast.

01:50:03.416 --> 01:50:06.878
No grit? Rooster Cogburn? Not much!

01:51:08.690 --> 01:51:10.734
Well, Rooster...

01:51:11.818 --> 01:51:13.570
I'm shot to pieces.

01:51:21.578 --> 01:51:24.956
Hurray for the man from Texas!
Some bully shot!

01:51:37.051 --> 01:51:39.179
Damn you, Bo.

01:51:39.429 --> 01:51:44.017
First time you ever give me
reason to... cuss you!

01:52:39.864 --> 01:52:42.075
Help me!

01:52:45.412 --> 01:52:48.915
Help me, I'm in the pit!

01:52:51.126 --> 01:52:53.503
There's a snake down here
and a skeleton.

01:52:53.753 --> 01:52:59.592
There'll be another one before long.
A little spindly one.

01:52:59.801 --> 01:53:01.386
How do you like it?

01:53:01.594 --> 01:53:03.430
Help me. Help me.

01:53:06.433 --> 01:53:08.768
Please help me!

01:53:08.977 --> 01:53:11.771
Are you saying you don't like it?

01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:23.408
Baby sister!

01:53:35.378 --> 01:53:39.799
- Are you down there, sis?
- Yes, hurry! I'm in a bad way!

01:53:40.008 --> 01:53:42.635
All right, hold on.

01:53:49.392 --> 01:53:54.898
I'm gonna pitch you a rope.
Slip it under your arms and tie a knot.

01:53:55.106 --> 01:53:58.610
I can't! I'm caught
and my arm is broken.

01:53:58.818 --> 01:54:01.613
There are snakes down here.

01:54:20.048 --> 01:54:21.800
It's in here now!

01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:48.535
Hang on right here.

01:54:58.795 --> 01:55:01.214
When you need a damn Texan,
he's dead!

01:55:01.423 --> 01:55:05.844
I ain't dead yet, you bushwacker!
Hang on!

01:55:14.728 --> 01:55:16.771
I want Papa's gun.

01:55:23.319 --> 01:55:27.699
- I want the other gold piece, too.
- You sure you don't want the snake?

01:55:27.907 --> 01:55:30.994
- No. But I want the gold piece.
- Forget it.

01:55:31.202 --> 01:55:33.413
But it's mine and I want it!

01:56:32.555 --> 01:56:37.352
That Texican... saved my neck twice.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:40.146
Once after he was dead.

01:56:41.981 --> 01:56:47.237
We'll have to do something
about this snakebite in a hurry.

01:57:41.833 --> 01:57:44.377
Hold this arm up, little sister.

01:58:03.146 --> 01:58:07.358
- We can't leave him like this.
- I'm the one that's leaving him.

01:58:07.567 --> 01:58:11.696
If I don't get you a doctor,
you'll be deader than he is.

01:58:13.198 --> 01:58:18.161
- Little Blackie can't carry us both.
- He'll have to. He's all I could catch.

01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:53.363
Stop it!

01:58:53.571 --> 01:58:55.865
We must stop, he's played out!

01:59:01.413 --> 01:59:03.540
Stop it! You're killing him!

02:00:16.446 --> 02:00:18.073
Hold it!

02:00:18.239 --> 02:00:21.409
Fling them guns into that creek!

02:00:22.869 --> 02:00:25.705
I'm borrowing this wagon off you.

02:01:15.422 --> 02:01:17.465
Boots! Finch!

02:01:29.811 --> 02:01:31.187
Boots!

02:01:32.230 --> 02:01:33.565
Boots!

02:02:13.646 --> 02:02:16.858
Am I addressing
Marshal Reuben J Cogburn?

02:02:17.067 --> 02:02:21.780
You're addressing him, Chen Lee
and General Sterling Price.

02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:25.617
Well... I'll not ask which is which.

02:02:25.825 --> 02:02:28.036
But I'll identify myself.

02:02:28.828 --> 02:02:31.456
I am lawyer, J Noble Daggett.

02:02:32.999 --> 02:02:35.794
- I'll be damned!
- What?

02:02:36.002 --> 02:02:40.673
Well, you're not...
exactly what we expected.

02:02:40.882 --> 02:02:43.051
You're a little... You're shrunk!

02:02:43.593 --> 02:02:45.178
I'll tell you frankly.

02:02:45.428 --> 02:02:49.599
I fully intended to have you jailed,
and I'm just the man who could do it.

02:02:49.808 --> 02:02:53.686
But when Mattie told me the straight
of the matter, I had second thoughts.

02:02:53.895 --> 02:02:57.065
I still think you showed
poor judgement in this affair,

02:02:57.273 --> 02:03:00.068
but you're not the scoundrel
I took you for.

02:03:00.276 --> 02:03:04.781
You have my thanks and,
with certain reservations, my respect.

02:03:04.989 --> 02:03:08.201
How nice! How is sis?

02:03:09.536 --> 02:03:11.579
Gravely ill, I'm afraid.

02:03:11.746 --> 02:03:15.333
But still able to direct her affairs.

02:03:15.542 --> 02:03:21.297
She commissioned me
to pay you the balance of the $75 due.

02:03:23.216 --> 02:03:28.054
- She didn't ask for a receipt, did she?
- As a matter of fact, she did.

02:03:29.931 --> 02:03:34.352
You will find that it also covers
an additional $200...

02:03:34.561 --> 02:03:36.521
...for saving her life.

02:03:36.730 --> 02:03:39.232
<i>Well, I will be damned!</i>

02:03:39.482 --> 02:03:44.446
She says that when she goes home,
she wants you to take her there.

02:03:44.654 --> 02:03:49.075
Poor child does not know
how ill she really is.

02:03:49.284 --> 02:03:53.413
Lawyer, J Noble Daggett,
are you a betting man?

02:03:53.621 --> 02:03:55.415
On occasion.

02:03:55.665 --> 02:04:02.088
All of this and General Price,
that she makes it back to Yell County.

02:04:05.467 --> 02:04:07.302
Oh, no!

02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:09.554
No, sir, no, sir!

02:04:22.317 --> 02:04:25.862
Why didn't you look up
La Beef's girl in Waco?

02:04:26.071 --> 02:04:28.782
I did the best I could.

02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:31.701
I took the boy home
to be buried in his ranger's suit.

02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:35.663
No girl showed up.
I don't believe there was one.

02:04:35.872 --> 02:04:38.458
You were too busy
collecting the reward.

02:04:38.666 --> 02:04:44.339
I was just a little busy. They forgot
how much the reward was.

02:04:44.589 --> 02:04:49.427
- I had to help them remember.
- I can imagine how you did that!

02:04:52.305 --> 02:04:55.517
This is what I wanted you to see.

02:04:55.767 --> 02:04:58.812
Papa's marker was
not what was ordered.

02:04:59.020 --> 02:05:03.233
I had to make
that fool of a stoneman change it.

02:05:06.444 --> 02:05:09.989
Some day, Mama will be here.

02:05:10.198 --> 02:05:13.326
And my brother
and his family over there.

02:05:13.535 --> 02:05:16.955
And that is for my sister
and her family.

02:05:18.248 --> 02:05:22.585
And I will be here,
on the other side of Papa.

02:05:22.794 --> 02:05:26.506
It's comforting to know
where we'll meet eternity.

02:05:29.634 --> 02:05:32.971
I would like you
to rest beside me, Rooster.

02:05:34.764 --> 02:05:39.853
Now, sis, that place
should be for your family,

02:05:40.061 --> 02:05:43.022
your husband, kids...

02:05:49.863 --> 02:05:53.992
You have no kin.
I don't count Chen Lee and the cat.

02:05:54.242 --> 02:05:57.454
Where would you end up?
A neglected patch of weeds?

02:05:58.288 --> 02:06:01.332
I might just take you up
on that offer, sis.

02:06:01.541 --> 02:06:04.711
Excuse me
if I don't try to move in too soon.

02:06:06.504 --> 02:06:09.382
I think it's only right
that you have Papa's gun.

02:06:09.591 --> 02:06:13.762
- It might keep you alive.
- I'm not so sure about that.

02:06:13.970 --> 02:06:16.723
Almost got you killed
when it misfired once!

02:06:16.931 --> 02:06:19.517
Because you loaded it wrong
in a state of drunkenness.

02:06:19.726 --> 02:06:23.063
- I ought to get you to show me how.
- I will.

02:06:28.485 --> 02:06:32.989
- Trust you to buy another tall horse.
- Yeah...

02:06:33.198 --> 02:06:38.828
He's not as game as Bo, but Stonehill
says he can jump a four-rail fence!

02:06:39.037 --> 02:06:43.625
You're too old and too fat
to be jumping horses!

02:06:45.835 --> 02:06:50.006
Well, come to see
a fat old man some time.
