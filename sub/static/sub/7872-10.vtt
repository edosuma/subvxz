Whoa!

00:21.288 --> 00:24.123

00:24.125 --> 00:25.457
D'oh!

And in other news...

00:43.177 --> 00:45.210
(all sigh happily)

00:52.852 --> 00:53.986
BOTH:
Are we there yet?

00:53.988 --> 00:55.020
Are we there yet?
No.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.321
Are we there yet?
No!

00:56.323 --> 00:57.856
Are we there yet?
I said no!

00:57.858 --> 00:59.992
Are we there yet?
What's wrong with your ears?

00:59.994 --> 01:01.693
Are we there yet?
Look out the window!

01:01.695 --> 01:03.495
Are we there yet?
We're not there!

01:03.497 --> 01:05.497
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

01:05.499 --> 01:06.665
Okay.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.000
We're there. Finally.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.168
Are we there yet?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.436
Huh?
Are we there yet?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.271
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.505
Damn technology!

01:13.507 --> 01:14.440
Are we there yet?

01:14.442 --> 01:15.507
Turn it off!

01:15.509 --> 01:16.942
We did.
This is us.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.677
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

01:18.679 --> 01:19.845
(anguished scream)

01:19.847 --> 01:20.913
(laughter)

01:20.915 --> 01:22.181
HOMER:
Ooh, a spot.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.249
Okay, remember we're parked

01:24.251 --> 01:26.185
in the "Ethnic Princess"
section.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.187
(horn honking)
HOMER:
Don't worry,

01:28.189 --> 01:30.923
this time I'm gonna write down
where I parked.

01:41.968 --> 01:43.969
(crowd shouting)

01:43.971 --> 01:45.604

01:53.080 --> 01:54.313
Mama!

01:54.315 --> 01:55.314
We made it!

01:55.316 --> 01:56.815
Mama?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.884
No!

02:08.294 --> 02:10.295
You planted that on me, man!

02:12.232 --> 02:14.299
(screaming)

02:18.738 --> 02:21.240
Sorry. No outside pacifiers.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.445
Fine, but I'm not paying
for the insurance.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.581
Oh, what the hell?
Give me the insurance.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.251
(sizzles)

02:32.253 --> 02:33.952
Come on, Maggie.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.256
The first ride we go on
will be for you.

Whoa, this place
sure has changed

03:11.292 --> 03:13.959
since Dizznee bought the rights
to Cosmic Wars.

Pirates of the Caribbean!

03:29.810 --> 03:31.143
Huh?

03:31.145 --> 03:32.511
They revamped this ride

My cartoons weren't good,

03:48.495 --> 03:49.728
they were just first!

03:53.833 --> 03:55.267
ALL:
Ooh!

03:55.269 --> 03:57.336
Not enough ketchup.

04:02.775 --> 04:04.743
(groans)
We've been here six hours

04:04.745 --> 04:06.245
and the coolest thing
we've done

04:06.247 --> 04:07.846
is stand in the Cool Zone.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.016
ANNOUNCER: The Cool Zone

by jetpa...

04:50.291 --> 04:51.890
Well, that's it.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.392
We've visited every section

04:53.394 --> 04:56.128
including Churro County,
Toonton Abbey,

04:56.130 --> 04:57.929
but you know what

04:57.931 --> 04:59.398
we haven't had here?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.565
I'll tell you:

05:00.567 --> 05:02.301
fun. The kind of fun

05:02.303 --> 05:04.503
attractive families have
in commercials.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.172
Hey, Dad, I see a ride
that actually looks decent.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.607
I just want to sit down,

05:08.609 --> 05:11.343
but the line for the bench
is too long.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.413
No, look, it's a ride that
just opened and no one's there.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.017
Dad, I don't know about this.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.952
It's not on the park map.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.088
Lisa, those maps were drawn

05:23.090 --> 05:25.524
by the first explorers
of this theme park,

05:25.526 --> 05:27.025
hundreds of years ago.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.593
Let's go.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.965
KANG:
Assume a sitting position.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.435
KODOS:
One seat per human.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.103
Come on, start this thing!

05:38.105 --> 05:39.338
I'm not impressed.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.512
This is so fake.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.620
HOMER:
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

05:55.622 --> 05:56.788
ALL:
Ooh!

05:56.790 --> 05:59.124
We've left Earth's atmosphere.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.859
Prove it. (squeals)

06:05.131 --> 06:06.298
BART AND LISA: <i>Are we there yet?</i>

Are we there yet?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.534
Welcome, humans.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.303
There is nothing to fear.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.138
I am Kang the Abductor.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.973
What the...?
This isn't Halloween.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.641
Are we truly in space?

06:16.643 --> 06:18.143
And if so, why?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.145
All will be revealed in time,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.147
unsuspecting humans.

06:22.149 --> 06:24.983
Why does the last thing
you say sound so ominous?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.818
It's just the way we speak,

06:26.820 --> 06:28.487
easily reassured fool.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.521
(sighing happily)
Oh!

06:29.523 --> 06:30.655
Yeah, that's good.

06:30.657 --> 06:31.823
We shall now attend

06:31.825 --> 06:35.160
to the complex calculations
of hyperspace.

06:35.162 --> 06:38.397
(chuckling)

06:42.502 --> 06:43.769
Hey, Captain Squid!

06:43.771 --> 06:45.670
If you really want
to be nice to us,

06:45.672 --> 06:46.838
how about some snacks?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.341
Whatever you say
shall materialize.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.676
Potato chips.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.745
("Blue Danube Waltz" playing)

06:56.249 --> 06:57.416
D'oh!

06:57.418 --> 06:58.917
D'oh!

07:01.187 --> 07:02.354
D'oh!

07:02.356 --> 07:03.588
D'oh!

07:07.026 --> 07:08.593
D'oh! D'oh!

07:10.530 --> 07:11.763
D'oh!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.031
D'oh!

07:13.033 --> 07:15.600
Stupid kid,
you ruin every trip!

07:20.072 --> 07:21.573
Hokey Smokes!

07:21.575 --> 07:23.475
I can't survive
in these conditions!

07:23.477 --> 07:24.643
Whoa!

07:25.578 --> 07:26.812
(sighs)

07:26.814 --> 07:28.380
Hmm!

07:28.382 --> 07:30.582
(grunts) Hmm!

07:30.584 --> 07:32.317
(laughs)

07:32.319 --> 07:33.418
Homer, please.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.487
That's creeping me out.

07:38.057 --> 07:39.257
D'oh!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.625
(chuckles) Let me just...

07:40.627 --> 07:41.893
There you are,

07:41.895 --> 07:43.895
just like new,

07:43.897 --> 07:46.631
not a freak of nature.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.235
Wow, look at all these knobs
and buttons.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.337
They are clearly
a superior race.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.439
But maybe that means
they'll be nice to us.

07:54.441 --> 07:57.676
You mean like Europeans were
to the Native Americans?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.744
Or the Belgians were
to the Congo?

07:59.746 --> 08:00.912
That's right.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.347
Pick the only two times
in history

08:02.349 --> 08:04.015
where things got messy.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.619
We have begun our descent
to our home planet.

08:07.621 --> 08:11.189
Please turn off all
portable electronic devices.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.257
Who's gonna stop me?

08:12.259 --> 08:13.625
Perhaps you haven't noticed

08:13.627 --> 08:14.926
the air marshal.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.135
Have your cups lost their suck?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.104
Slipped on some drool?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.773
Larry H. Zeeblezorp
will have you

08:28.775 --> 08:30.942
rolling in space credits.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.778
Wow. This place
is completely alien,

08:33.780 --> 08:35.614
but everything's in English.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.781
Just like Canada.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.351
KODOS:
<i>Not yet.</i>

08:40.786 --> 08:41.953
Now what?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.189
I say we take
this bucket home!

08:45.791 --> 08:46.958
To Earth!

08:46.960 --> 08:48.527
(engine not starting)

08:49.795 --> 08:51.129
Come on.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.131
Come on, you son of a...

08:53.133 --> 08:54.633
Thanks for flooding it.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.302
(engine not starting)

08:57.304 --> 08:58.803
(groans)

08:58.805 --> 09:00.171
Take these pills,

09:00.173 --> 09:02.474
and you can breathe
our atmosphere.

09:02.476 --> 09:03.975
Are there any side effects?

09:03.977 --> 09:07.145
Yes, I'm afraid you will never
develop tentacles.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.214
(groans)

09:11.817 --> 09:15.153
Behold the wonders of our world.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.821
Purple landscape,

09:16.823 --> 09:18.490
purple trees.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.825
Yeah, you really went
with the purple theme.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.828
We can change it at will.

09:23.830 --> 09:27.666
Now look upward
to see our seven suns.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.535
(gasps) So, you use
a lot of solar energy?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.837
We have federal rebates
for the panels,

09:32.839 --> 09:34.673
but few take advantage
of them.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.175
Now we shall show you

09:37.177 --> 09:40.178
the sacred mysteries
of our life cycle.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.681
Behold, our miracle of birth.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.249
Each birth is followed

09:44.251 --> 09:46.851
by another birth
just seconds later.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.019
(groans)

09:48.021 --> 09:50.088
(all groaning)

09:53.526 --> 09:57.362
And finally,
a sadder slice of our lives.

09:57.364 --> 10:00.865
Gaze upon the dead
being dumped into a river

10:00.867 --> 10:03.034
of their own drool.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.869
(bagpipes playing)

10:04.871 --> 10:06.471
Farewell, dear friends,

10:06.473 --> 10:09.207
on your sacred journey
to the chopper-upper.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.475
Aw.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.310
Why are you sharing
all this with us?

10:12.312 --> 10:15.814
Because we want you to
fully appreciate the planet...

10:15.816 --> 10:18.149
that you will never leave!

10:18.151 --> 10:19.584
(gasping)

10:19.586 --> 10:22.387
Wait, are you telling me

10:22.389 --> 10:25.290
we're prisoners in this cage?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.797
Okay, take five.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.969
(dissonant bagpipe chord)

10:42.508 --> 10:44.075
(screeching)

10:45.678 --> 10:47.178
Don't look at them.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.247
You can see those birds
any time.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.348
(meows)

10:50.350 --> 10:52.417
(screaming)

10:55.354 --> 10:58.023
Right hand red!

10:58.025 --> 10:59.357
Aah!
I win.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.426
I think.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.494
(grunts)

11:11.303 --> 11:14.773
Would you like one of our toys?

11:14.775 --> 11:16.941
Thanks.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.777
Why did you do that?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.311
I thought it was a ball.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.014
That is the one thing
it can never be.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.991
(plays instrument out of tune)

11:32.993 --> 11:35.460
Don't be alarmed.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.462
I am a trained humanologist.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.464
Let me just check your heart.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.965
All well and good.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.701
You obviously exercise.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.968
(nasally):
See, Marge?

11:43.970 --> 11:45.470
Anything you need?
Perhaps you'd care

11:45.472 --> 11:47.839
to have your ink gland
expressed.

11:47.841 --> 11:49.140
You're the doctor.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.308
Homer!

11:50.310 --> 11:52.143
You have to stop
dropping your pants

11:52.145 --> 11:54.479
for everyone who claims
they're a doctor.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.480
Fine.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.981
Now, I am here to complete

11:56.983 --> 12:00.151
your knowledge of our
great and generous species.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.487
Are you the guy that talks nice
before they kill us?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.322
Eh, we'll come back to that.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.658
As young thinglings,
we are schooled

12:06.660 --> 12:08.660
in the wisdom of the universe.

12:08.662 --> 12:11.329
Physics, mathematics, Fortran...

12:11.331 --> 12:14.165
the greatest
of the programming languages!

12:14.167 --> 12:17.001
And now the part that is
difficult to tell you.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.037
At the end of a life well-lived,

12:19.039 --> 12:21.773
there is one final ritual.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.175
We must eat one of you.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.177
(all gasp)
But we'll let you have

12:26.179 --> 12:28.012
the fun of picking which one.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.181
(laughs)

12:30.183 --> 12:32.517
There's only one fair solution.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.352
We have to put it to a vote.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.854
Before we vote,
I'd just like to point out

12:35.856 --> 12:38.323
in <i>Sophie's Choice,</i>
<i>she saved the boy.</i>

12:41.527 --> 12:43.595
(humming a tune)

12:43.597 --> 12:45.864
This isn't a happy thing!

12:45.866 --> 12:48.032
Here you go.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.200
Okay.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.268
What the...?!

12:50.270 --> 12:51.369
D'oh!

12:51.371 --> 12:54.272
Well, we haven't heard
from Maggie yet.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.740
Now, what the...?

12:55.742 --> 12:57.976
(scoffs)
Gibberish, pure gibberish.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.044
You're the last vote, Homie.

13:02.148 --> 13:04.215
(groaning)

13:08.387 --> 13:10.555
'Tis a far,
far better thing I do

13:10.557 --> 13:13.057
than I have ever done before.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.127
Hey, look, Maggie made you
a farewell card.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.965
That kid's got talent,
but come on!

13:20.967 --> 13:23.434
Now do you see why
I'm a vegetarian, Dad?

13:23.436 --> 13:24.769
I get it, Lisa.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.571
I finally get it.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.339
You do get a last meal.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.074
I'd like rabbit,
lots of rabbit.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.242
Ah.

13:32.678 --> 13:35.613
Welcome to the World Series
of Chomping.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.348
This annual consumption ritual

13:37.350 --> 13:40.852
is brought to you by scalp salt.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.687
From the same
wonderful folks who make

13:42.689 --> 13:45.590
elbow pepper and groin gravy.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.426
Here comes sacrifice
Homer Simpson.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.628
His hobbies include
sitting, lying down,

13:50.630 --> 13:53.097
and reaching for things
without success.

13:53.099 --> 13:56.267
Come on, folks, let's put
your eyelids together!

13:56.269 --> 13:58.169
(eyelids clapping)

13:59.271 --> 14:02.607
Doesn't your culture say
anything about mercy?

14:02.609 --> 14:04.776
Madam, you are speaking
to the kindest

14:04.778 --> 14:06.945
and gentlest of us all.

14:06.947 --> 14:07.979
Let's see:

14:07.981 --> 14:09.948
skull crusher, skin peeler,

14:09.950 --> 14:11.616
eyeball popper,

14:11.618 --> 14:12.951
scream collector...

14:12.953 --> 14:14.118
(gasps)

14:14.120 --> 14:15.787
Got it.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.456
Our elder Klaunax has been
chosen for our ceremonial

14:18.458 --> 14:19.958
first bite,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.326
after which Homer Simpson
will be dipped

14:21.328 --> 14:24.128
into a spicy cheese fondue.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.463
"Fondue"?

14:25.465 --> 14:28.967
Welcome to a faculty
dinner party in 1979.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.636
Silence! And celebrate the
Solstice of Slobbering

14:31.638 --> 14:35.306
to the sounds of the
Rigel 7 Children's Choir.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.809
♪ Tasty creature

14:37.811 --> 14:40.478

14:52.158 --> 14:53.491
A transporter beam!

14:53.493 --> 14:56.828
Someone is trying
to steal our sacrifice.

14:56.830 --> 14:57.996
Yes!

14:57.998 --> 14:59.030
This mysterious tube can

14:59.032 --> 15:00.331
only lead to somewhere good.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.333
So long,

15:02.335 --> 15:03.668
What the...?!

15:03.670 --> 15:06.337

15:06.339 --> 15:09.274
And away we go!

15:09.276 --> 15:10.675
(sighs)

15:16.015 --> 15:17.849
Way to go, George Mucus. The
fattest, stupidest man on Earth

15:17.851 --> 15:20.351
slipped right through
your sticky tentacles.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.586
Why, you little...!

15:23.856 --> 15:25.690
What is this baffling construct?

15:25.692 --> 15:26.858
It's called a knot.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.192
A not what?

15:28.194 --> 15:29.694
"Knot" with a "K."

15:29.696 --> 15:31.696
Ks are silent?
Really?

15:31.698 --> 15:34.198
I've been saying kitchen.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.867
That's correct.
BOTH: Huh?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.869
(Homer gasps)

15:37.871 --> 15:40.371
MALE:
Do not fear.
You are among friends.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.106
We are the resistance.

15:42.108 --> 15:45.710
We don't believe in the barbaric
consumption of other species.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.312
So, what do you eat--
space broccoli?

15:47.314 --> 15:49.580
Space broccoli has the
most advanced feelings

15:49.582 --> 15:51.716
of any creature
in the universe.

15:51.718 --> 15:55.553
I stepped on a piece once,
and it cried for six years.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.455
Frankly, they are a
little full of themselves.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.290
Who are you talking about?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.059
Um, earth broccoli.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.794
Yeah, I hate those guys.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.228
They think they're so big.

16:04.230 --> 16:05.430
Let's go, Homer.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.731
Where are you taking me?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.934
You are about to behold
the secret rebel base.

16:09.936 --> 16:13.137
♪

16:14.606 --> 16:15.740
Aah!

16:15.742 --> 16:17.241
Whee!
Yeah!

16:17.243 --> 16:18.509
Why are they dancing?

16:18.511 --> 16:20.345
Shouldn't they be
making weapons?

16:20.347 --> 16:21.746
This is excellent training

16:21.748 --> 16:24.849
for the party we will throw
when our rebellion succeeds.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.021
(music stops)
MALE:
Oh, turn the music back on.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.023
In a minute!

16:32.025 --> 16:34.759
First, noble human Homer Simpson

16:34.761 --> 16:38.596
will explain his primitive
yet beautiful culture.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.431
(bird caws)

16:40.433 --> 16:44.268
But perhaps Earth's greatest
achievement is moon rocks.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.938
Oh, and the golden age of radio.

16:46.940 --> 16:47.939
(all oohing)

16:47.941 --> 16:51.275
Truly a species
with much to offer.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.311
MALE:
Seriously? Are we listening
to the same guy?

16:53.313 --> 16:54.445
Silence!

16:54.447 --> 16:56.948
Homer, we will get you
back to Earth.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.282
What about my family?

16:58.284 --> 16:59.450
Why do you care?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.786
It's just your sex
mate and spermlings.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.121
"Sex mate"?
(laughs)

17:03.123 --> 17:04.956
Clearly you've
never been married.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.557
But it's great, I'm telling you.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.294
Unfortunately, we
only had the means

17:10.296 --> 17:11.963
to build the spaceship for one.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.298
We spent most of our
money on the party.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.501
Well, it is a great party.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.303
The pod is equipped to fulfill
your deepest desires.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.039
Just concentrate.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.382
Suddenly, this trip
has gotten interesting.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.818
(gasps)

17:33.820 --> 17:35.987
What the...?!

17:35.989 --> 17:37.488
Oh, who am I kidding?

17:37.490 --> 17:40.324
I couldn't enjoy calorie one
without my family.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.993
I'm going back to save them!

17:41.995 --> 17:45.329
Aw, if I could
just live inside

17:45.331 --> 17:49.333
that head, so full
of noble thoughts.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.402
(growls, grunting)

17:53.672 --> 17:56.274
The golden rule states
if the chosen one escapes,

17:56.276 --> 17:59.177
his family is eaten as forfeit.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.679
What do your rules say now?

18:01.681 --> 18:03.081
That all will be eaten.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.315
D'oh!

18:05.684 --> 18:08.186
This system is
really rigged against us.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.855
(Bart and Marge groan)

18:10.857 --> 18:12.523
You forgot to glaze me.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.026
No, I didn't.
You licked it off!

18:15.028 --> 18:18.930
I think somebody's afraid
to admit he's out of glaze.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.998
(groans)

18:25.537 --> 18:27.705
Glaze, please.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.273
(growls)

18:30.709 --> 18:32.276
Make way for the queen!

18:36.148 --> 18:38.382
I shall take the first bite.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.084
It is quite an honor.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.752
(whimpering)
What's that?

18:41.754 --> 18:43.721
Part of your magnificent behind.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.723
We sliced it off
when you were sleeping.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.625
It does look delicious.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.268
(gasps)
What is it, my queen?

18:57.270 --> 19:01.105
This ass is most disagreeable.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.640
(gurgles)

19:04.143 --> 19:05.510
The creatures are composed

19:05.512 --> 19:08.579
of completely
indigestible toxins.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.850
These humans have
been poisoned

19:12.852 --> 19:16.087
by their unhealthy
fast-food diet.

19:16.089 --> 19:19.257
Um, are you sure you don't want
to try me again?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.093
You? Your lunches of
hummus and rice cakes

19:22.095 --> 19:25.129
combine in your stomach to form
formaldehyde and animal fat.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.931
Really? But I thought...

19:26.933 --> 19:30.434
You'd be better off
chewing tobacco like the boy.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.135
What?!

19:31.137 --> 19:32.303
Dad said I could try it.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.604
Homer!

19:33.606 --> 19:36.941
Don't you people realize
your queen is dying?

19:36.943 --> 19:40.778
I'm afraid the lardo speaks
the truth, Your Majesty.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.280
It's all right.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.316
I have seen many glories
and have only one regret.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.618
That my breasts aren't bigger.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.953
I don't see any breasts.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.454
And those will be

19:50.456 --> 19:53.958
the last words I ever hear.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.626
(grunts)

19:55.628 --> 19:56.994
Useless humans!

19:56.996 --> 19:58.963
We will send you back
to your planet,

19:58.965 --> 20:01.132
and your memories will fade.

20:01.134 --> 20:04.869
So, it will be as if none
of this ever happened!

20:07.806 --> 20:12.176
Captain's log, stardate 65848.2.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.979
After successfully conquering
the Rigelians...

20:14.981 --> 20:16.981
Right, "conquering."

20:16.983 --> 20:18.816
Well, at least
Maggie can fly us home.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.085
Thank God it's just
like her busy box.

20:24.323 --> 20:27.491
Well, I guess we've learned that
of all the countless planets

20:27.493 --> 20:29.327
in the universe, we have evolved

20:29.329 --> 20:32.496
into the most inedible species.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.665
Like three-bean
salad at a barbecue,

20:34.667 --> 20:37.168
we will remain untouched.

20:37.170 --> 20:40.905
We're receiving a transmission
from an unknown source.

20:43.208 --> 20:46.244
Hey, I finally tracked you down!

20:46.246 --> 20:48.679
My oatmeal's gone cold.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.514
The cat ate my heart medicine.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.016
I'm engaged to my nurse...
Set a course, Mr. Maggie.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.085
Anywhere but home.
