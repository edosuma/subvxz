00:01.478 --> 00:03.248
Kenny!
Aah!

00:05.455 --> 00:08.028
What's going on with April?
Back together with Cutler.

00:08.063 --> 00:10.434
Good thing I'm in the midst
of this monumental comeback.

00:10.468 --> 00:12.506
<i>When I take the
mound it's a big deal.</i>

00:12.540 --> 00:15.281
<i>I'm talking about fireworks,
smoke bombs, laser beams.</i>

00:15.315 --> 00:16.818
Pow!
Done.

00:16.852 --> 00:19.590
<i>Friday is gonna be the
biggest comeback celebration.</i>

00:19.624 --> 00:21.761
<i>There's gonna be people
cheering and screaming.</i>

00:21.795 --> 00:23.398
<i>So don't be jealous
little bitches.</i>

00:23.433 --> 00:27.173
Please let me join you
on this Hispanic adventure.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.411
Welcome to the resistance.
Fuck, yes.

00:34.457 --> 00:44.626

00:50.654 --> 00:52.991
Oh, what the fuck, Stevie!
Gross!

00:53.025 --> 00:55.695
You're crop-dusting my whole
entire bedroom with your pubes.

00:55.729 --> 00:57.031
Oh, sorry, Kenny.

00:57.066 --> 00:59.502
Don't be sorry, dude.
Just cover up that marble sack.

00:59.536 --> 01:02.107
I think you mean marbles
and bananas, Kenny.

01:02.141 --> 01:04.912
I don't think so.
I'm just seeing marbles.

01:04.946 --> 01:06.581
Then you're not
looking close enough.

01:06.616 --> 01:08.151
I dot want
to fucking look closer.

01:08.185 --> 01:10.188
Okay.
Wait a second here.

01:10.222 --> 01:12.224
Hold up. Hold up!

01:12.259 --> 01:13.460
Hold up.

01:13.494 --> 01:15.430
What?
Is that my thong?

01:15.465 --> 01:17.067
Yeah, all my stuff
had blood on it.

01:17.101 --> 01:19.237
Oh, dude, no way.
You do not go in my drawers

01:19.271 --> 01:21.840
and take a pair of my chones.
That's a big no-no.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.844
I got these out
of the dirty clothes hamper.

01:23.879 --> 01:26.248
Oh, my God! Sickening.
Dude, I'm about the throw up.

01:26.282 --> 01:28.718
Stevie, I got a laundry list
of shit for you to do tomorrow,

01:28.753 --> 01:31.290
and it l like buying new
underwear just moved to the top.

01:31.324 --> 01:33.260
I'm also gonna need you
to fix the Denali.

01:33.295 --> 01:34.896
What's wrong with it?

01:34.931 --> 01:37.734
It don't fucking move.
Now, fix it. Jesus H. Christ.

01:37.768 --> 01:40.271
Okay, so buy underwear,
number one.

01:40.305 --> 01:42.875
Number two, fix that car.
Anything else?

01:42.910 --> 01:45.512
Well, since you're turning this
room into your own quarters,

01:45.546 --> 01:47.181
maybe you should
make it comfortable.

01:47.216 --> 01:49.284
It's been a traumatic experience
for you, dude.

01:49.319 --> 01:50.787
You've been through a lot.

01:50.821 --> 01:52.990
Maybe you should get
a flat screen TV.

01:53.025 --> 01:54.826
Don't skimp and get the Vizio.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.230
Get what you deserve.
Get the Sony.

01:57.265 --> 01:59.834
Ooh, I wonder if they have
the 3D models here yet.

01:59.868 --> 02:02.338
Don't get all excited, dude,
3D's gay.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.341
Nobody wants to sit
on a couch wearing glasses,

02:04.375 --> 02:07.378
popping bubbles out of the air
like some fucked-up Ray Charles.

02:07.413 --> 02:09.414
I do.
Oh, you like 3D?

02:09.449 --> 02:11.885
Well, here's a burrito.
Coming right at you.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:27.777 --> 02:28.777
Shit!

02:30.848 --> 02:33.284
Ha-ha-ha.
No, No. Stop laughing.

02:33.318 --> 02:35.620
I'm about to go goddamn
nuclear in Mexico.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.623
What's up, Powers?
Why don't you tell me?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.392
Seems like I finally
win this team a game,

02:39.427 --> 02:41.261
come in her today
and the workers are taking

02:41.296 --> 02:42.931
my goddamn signs down.
What the hell?

02:42.965 --> 02:45.566
Oh, look, we always change
the promo signs, Kenny.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.268
You always change the signs.
Well, guess what? Not my signs.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.270
My signs are staying up.
Trying to mount a comeback here.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.639
I feel like nobody gives a shit.
Why'd you think that?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.474
Because I gave those fucking
people, all the villagers,

02:56.509 --> 02:59.010
my heart out there
and I got shit in return.

02:59.044 --> 03:00.778
I didn't even get
a fucking this.

03:00.812 --> 03:02.512
How fucking hard is it
to do this

03:02.547 --> 03:04.080
when someone does
something good?

03:04.114 --> 03:07.015
You think that's the first time
our fans have seen a strikeout?

03:07.050 --> 03:09.483
Give them time. They'll pick up
on you at their own pace.

03:09.518 --> 03:11.719
Getting everybody to love me
is a full-time job.

03:11.753 --> 03:13.820
I got the pitching down
but I need to focus on this.

03:13.854 --> 03:15.654
If I don't have love,
I don't have shit.

03:15.689 --> 03:18.292
Look, hey, look the signs
outside, the media out there,

03:18.326 --> 03:19.693
forget about them, Kenny.

03:19.727 --> 03:21.594
Roger, you're dumping
all this shit in my lap

03:21.629 --> 03:23.897
and I got to play Mr. Belvedere
and clean it up. Enough!

03:23.931 --> 03:25.498
Hey, Kenny.
Enough!

03:25.532 --> 03:27.366
No.

03:30.036 --> 03:32.403
Well, looks like we
got Atlanta all over again.

03:32.438 --> 03:34.406
Team ain't behind me
the way I need them to,

03:34.440 --> 03:35.807
so we have to
do this ourselves.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.142
Kick-start this revolution.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.444
I want every single person
in this town saying my name.

03:39.478 --> 03:42.647
At least you've got the grocery
store promotion coming up.

03:42.681 --> 03:44.715
You're right. It's a perfect
opportunity for me

03:44.749 --> 03:47.851
to capture the hearts and minds
of these fucking villagers.

03:47.885 --> 03:49.886
Also, I'm about
one slow hump away

03:49.921 --> 03:51.287
from finally being over April.

03:51.322 --> 03:52.522
I want to knock that out

03:52.556 --> 03:54.590
before we get too many
worshipers, you got it?

03:54.625 --> 03:57.926
Actually, Maria, my
sister-in-law, she's available.

03:57.961 --> 03:59.828
She is?
Ugh, sick.

03:59.862 --> 04:01.462
Not interested.
I always trade up.

04:01.497 --> 04:02.964
That's part of my code.

05:12.922 --> 05:15.456
Kenny. Kenny.

05:16.958 --> 05:20.494
Oh, hey. How's it going?
You hear I was in the barrio?

05:20.528 --> 05:24.130
I was just going
to the grocery store, but...

05:24.165 --> 05:26.265
Yeah, sure you were.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.534
Why are you dressed
as a mariachi?

05:28.568 --> 05:31.703
You know, I'm just doing some PR
shit here for the baseball team.

05:31.737 --> 05:33.871
Figured I'd dress
in the customary, you know,

05:33.905 --> 05:34.971
gowns and whatnot.

05:35.006 --> 05:36.239
You... ? You likey?

05:36.274 --> 05:37.574
Yeah, you look cute.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.209
<i>Do I look muy guapo
in this outfit?</i>

05:39.243 --> 05:40.777
Oh, yeah.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.580
<i>Delicioso, Matatan.
You hear that?</i>

05:45.616 --> 05:47.983
This guy over here.
Cheese dick.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.652
So, um,
you're signing autographs?

05:50.686 --> 05:52.420
Yeah, I'm supposed to be.

05:53.655 --> 05:55.289
How come there's no one
in your line?

05:55.323 --> 05:56.723
That's a good question.

05:56.758 --> 05:59.159
I've been trying to figure
that out all goddamn morning.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.260
Sometimes I just feel like

06:00.294 --> 06:01.961
if you don't have
a goddamn soccer ball

06:01.995 --> 06:03.062
bouncing off your head,

06:03.096 --> 06:04.463
nobody even gives
two damn shits

06:04.498 --> 06:05.964
about you in this country.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.233
Pick it up.
Tantos, pick it up.

06:08.268 --> 06:11.069
Soccer is really popular here.

06:11.103 --> 06:12.170
Well, it's not in America.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.938
In America,
people fucking hate soccer.

06:13.972 --> 06:15.873
And honestly,
that's the way it should be.

06:15.907 --> 06:19.242
I don't know. I...
I kind of like soccer.

06:19.277 --> 06:20.744
You kind of like soccer?

06:20.778 --> 06:22.545
Yeah.
I'm gonna pretend

06:22.579 --> 06:24.579
like you didn't just
make my dick go soft.

06:25.848 --> 06:27.382
Really?
Yeah.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.817
No, it's totally soft... It's
just gone back inside of me.

06:29.851 --> 06:31.452
No don't talk about soccer.

06:31.486 --> 06:33.120
Well, maybe...

06:33.154 --> 06:35.755
Maybe you can show me
why baseball is better.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.958
Gladly. How about, say,
Saturday night

06:38.992 --> 06:40.526
at a very cool yacht party?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.094
A yacht party?

06:42.128 --> 06:43.595
Just a few top-tier types.

06:43.630 --> 06:47.298
An intimate dinner
with the owner of the Charros.

06:47.333 --> 06:50.201
There's gonna be an ass-ton
of crabs, lobsters, wine.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.103
Bartles & Jaymes, corn on
the cob, fucking booger sugar.

06:53.137 --> 06:56.406
But I... I can't tell when
you're being serious or not.

06:56.440 --> 07:00.209
Sweetheart, I'm always serious.
Care for an autograph?

07:01.811 --> 07:04.245
That's me and you,
Saturday night.

07:06.749 --> 07:09.884
Okay. See you on Saturday.

07:09.919 --> 07:11.486
That's what's up.

07:13.222 --> 07:15.156
All right, Matatan,
you get the rest of these.

07:15.191 --> 07:17.991
I'm gonna take me a siesta.

07:30.835 --> 07:31.968
<i>Hola.</i>

07:35.906 --> 07:39.607
Hey, Maria. Time to change
my bandage?

07:43.879 --> 07:46.446
Looks like I'm healing
pretty good, right?

07:46.481 --> 07:48.448
Oh, that's right,
you don't speak English.

07:48.483 --> 07:50.850
I could just say
whatever I want right now.

07:50.884 --> 07:56.688
Like tell you my secrets and
dreams and hopes and pleasures.

07:56.723 --> 07:59.057
Tell you what
I like to do alone.

08:00.459 --> 08:03.994
What my favorite foods are.
That's why I like you.

08:04.029 --> 08:05.529
Hey, man.

08:06.932 --> 08:08.799
- May I help you?
- Is Steve here?

08:08.834 --> 08:11.168
Uh, yeah. G.

08:11.203 --> 08:12.870
Uh, okay.

08:12.904 --> 08:14.504
Got him.

08:14.539 --> 08:16.573
Where is he?
Right in front of you.

08:16.607 --> 08:18.174
Who the fuck are you guys?

08:18.209 --> 08:21.545
You tell that asshole
we found Eduardo Sanchez.

08:21.579 --> 08:24.548
He give us money.
We give him address.

08:24.582 --> 08:27.217
Go inside.
I'll handle this.

08:27.251 --> 08:29.885
Who the hell
is Eduardo Sanchez?

08:29.920 --> 08:32.385
Don't ask fucking questions.

08:32.419 --> 08:35.688
Meet Monday at Big Red's grave.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.188
Who the hell is Big Red?

08:37.224 --> 08:39.857
Fuck you, and fuck your face.

08:39.893 --> 08:41.493
Piece of shit.

08:41.527 --> 08:43.828
Yeah, you better
get the fuck on.

08:43.863 --> 08:47.365
Suck this, motherfucker.

08:47.399 --> 08:48.933
Piece of crap.

08:50.135 --> 08:51.602
Bitches.

08:51.636 --> 08:55.605
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo! Party.

08:56.507 --> 08:57.607
Yay.

08:57.641 --> 08:59.042
Yay.

08:59.076 --> 09:00.109
Here we go.

09:00.144 --> 09:02.478
Yeah.

09:02.513 --> 09:04.848
Wow, that bike ride was fun.
All right.

09:04.882 --> 09:07.483
Yeah, well, my main car's
usually a Denali,

09:07.518 --> 09:09.185
but that shit's in the shop.

09:09.219 --> 09:11.587
Just cruising around
on this eco-friendly deal now,

09:11.622 --> 09:13.823
trying to go green.

09:13.857 --> 09:17.794
Wow, so the man who own
this boat, is...?

09:17.828 --> 09:19.495
Is he your boss, or...?

09:19.530 --> 09:21.965
Well, he owns the team, you
know, but the way I'm operating,

09:21.999 --> 09:25.134
I don't really kind of adhere
to the normal boss kind of shit.

09:25.168 --> 09:27.869
Ahoy.
Hi.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.671
Help me. Thank you.
Sure.

09:29.705 --> 09:32.040
All right.
On two, three.

09:32.075 --> 09:33.408
There you go.
Thanks.

09:38.580 --> 09:42.047
Easy, Tanto. She's with me.
Why don't you sit down.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.948
Oh, my star player.

09:44.983 --> 09:46.816
Tonight's the night.
Ye.

09:46.851 --> 09:50.116
Who is this firecracker?

09:50.150 --> 09:52.149
I'm Vida.

09:52.184 --> 09:53.450
You have a beautiful boat.

09:53.484 --> 09:56.619
Oh, thank you.
I work so hard for it.

09:58.856 --> 10:02.091
Welcome aboard,
and meet the people on the boat.

10:02.125 --> 10:04.793
<i>Come on, mi gente.
Let's get this party started.</i>

10:06.595 --> 10:08.296
Start the party.

10:08.330 --> 10:10.198
<i>♪ Hey, hey, the big dogs
Stay on the porch ♪</i>

10:10.232 --> 10:13.232
<i>♪ Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle ♪</i>

10:13.267 --> 10:14.867
Thanks for inviting me
to this shit.

10:14.901 --> 10:16.400
It's fucking fairly fly.

10:16.435 --> 10:18.968
Look at that. Look at that.

10:19.003 --> 10:21.938
I told you I'd bring the
hottest señorita in Mexico.

10:21.972 --> 10:23.706
How long have you been
with this one?

10:23.740 --> 10:24.874
Vida?
Yeah.

10:24.908 --> 10:26.675
She's been coming after me
for weeks, man.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.777
I just have to kind of
deflect her with both hands.

10:28.811 --> 10:30.878
Like, slow down, girl.
Stop trying to be the one.

10:30.912 --> 10:32.179
I'm just out of a relationship.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.547
But I bet you that sweet ass

10:33.581 --> 10:35.949
makes you forget about
any old relationship.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.651
Yeah, that's for sure. That's
why sometimes I masturbate.

10:38.686 --> 10:40.319
Hard to beat a nice ass.

10:40.354 --> 10:44.856
I take a nice ass over like a
big set of titties any day. You?

10:44.890 --> 10:47.225
I like them both. I think
they're both fucking awesome.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.126
Obviously.
But if you had to choose

10:49.161 --> 10:52.996
between titties or ass,
which one?

10:53.031 --> 10:56.800
Yeah, I see now what you're
saying. It's a hard choice.

10:56.834 --> 10:59.402
It's a choice in life.
No shit. I mean, I guess

10:59.436 --> 11:01.571
if I had to choose,
I mean historilly,

11:01.605 --> 11:04.173
I've always considered myself
to be a tit man.

11:04.207 --> 11:06.141
But this one has you thinking.

11:06.175 --> 11:07.342
Well, it's no mystery

11:07.376 --> 11:09.943
that ass has always been
tits' greatest enemy.

11:09.977 --> 11:12.645
It's almost like a Muslim-Jewish
thing, but with tits and ass.

11:12.679 --> 11:14.246
And which side are you on?

11:22.089 --> 11:25.357
All right. Same rules as last
time. No catching feelings.

11:25.392 --> 11:27.159
I'm damaged goods,
so you will have my body

11:27.193 --> 11:29.561
but you will not have my heart.
Please don't expect it.

11:29.595 --> 11:31.763
Ha-ha. Stop talking.

11:31.797 --> 11:33.764
And pull out your dick.

11:33.799 --> 11:35.700
I want to play.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.092
Hey.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.727
Who the hell are you?

12:09.762 --> 12:11.962
My name is Tony.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.964
What is your name is?

12:13.998 --> 12:16.866
Huh. My name is Kenny.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.500
What, do you live here

12:18.535 --> 12:19.868
Yeah.
What are you,

12:19.902 --> 12:21.235
like Vida's roommate or shit?

12:21.270 --> 12:22.203
No.

12:22.237 --> 12:24.771
I'm her son.
Her son?

12:24.806 --> 12:27.406
You came out of her vagina?
Huh?

12:27.441 --> 12:29.242
I was all up in that shit
last night.

12:29.276 --> 12:32.847
What are you watching
on this TV set? This programs?

12:34.249 --> 12:36.950
So much funny stuff.

12:36.985 --> 12:39.686
I've seen shit like this before.
It's not funny.

12:40.654 --> 12:42.121
Do you like magic?

12:42.156 --> 12:43.189
No. Not really.

12:43.223 --> 12:44.924
Why, you gonna try
to make me disappear?

12:44.958 --> 12:46.592
I don't know how.

12:46.626 --> 12:47.759
I do.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.760
Start calling me "dad."

12:55.333 --> 12:57.734
I was wondering if I should feel bad. Not that
I'm emotional, but with blowing my load...

12:57.768 --> 13:01.002
after finding out that April
was married would've hurt.

13:01.036 --> 13:02.169
And did it?

13:02.204 --> 13:03.470
Not at all.

13:03.505 --> 13:05.605
No, it was actually
pretty fucking awesome.

13:05.639 --> 13:07.540
You should have seen
the size of her ass.

13:07.574 --> 13:08.974
It was fucking incredible.

13:09.008 --> 13:11.743
It was like a goddamn hot-air
balloon right in front of me.

13:11.777 --> 13:14.044
I went pfft, all over the thing
as soon as I saw it.

13:14.078 --> 13:16.379
The only thing iffy,
turns out she has a kid.

13:16.413 --> 13:18.780
What? Like a real one?
Seemed pretty real to me.

13:18.815 --> 13:21.182
He's sitting there playing
fucking magic on the couch.

13:21.216 --> 13:22.583
Ew.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.485
I don't love the idea
of her having a kid.

13:24.519 --> 13:26.453
Makes you kind of feel
like her uterus is used.

13:26.487 --> 13:27.721
But, I mean,

13:27.755 --> 13:29.489
I guess the fact I didn't know
she had a kid

13:29.523 --> 13:30.989
was pretty cool.
And this kid

13:31.024 --> 13:32.190
is always home alone?

13:32.224 --> 13:33.391
Yeah, I guess so.

13:34.693 --> 13:37.829
The fucking kid is home alone.
Heh-heh.

13:37.863 --> 13:39.998
Yeah, it's pretty awesome, huh?

13:41.434 --> 13:44.604
She's asking you to try
one of those peppers.

13:44.638 --> 13:46.506
- These suckers?
- They're very good.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.810
I don't like fucking
around with no peppers.

13:48.845 --> 13:51.515
Stevie, you like putting slimy
things in your mouth, don't you?

13:51.549 --> 13:54.118
Yeah, I do.
Suck it, dawg.

13:55.053 --> 13:56.286
Put it in. Look at him.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.024
Yeah, lookit. Ugh.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.092
Don't just lick the tip.
Bite it.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.828
Ew!

14:06.862 --> 14:09.663
Fuck!

14:09.697 --> 14:11.298
Ugh!

14:11.332 --> 14:13.367
I knew that...

14:13.402 --> 14:15.704
What a fucking pussy.

14:24.913 --> 14:27.181
Kenny, there was some weird
Mexican motherfuckers

14:27.216 --> 14:28.883
that came by here yesterday.

14:28.917 --> 14:29.917
Well, who were they?

14:29.951 --> 14:31.518
Some fucking mongoloid

14:31.553 --> 14:33.887
and a fucking dwarf.

14:33.921 --> 14:34.988
Well, what did they want?

14:35.022 --> 14:36.889
They said they thought
they found somebody

14:36.924 --> 14:38.558
that you were looking for.

14:38.592 --> 14:42.194
Some Mexican name like
Eduardo or something like that.

14:42.228 --> 14:44.530
Eduardo Sanchez.
Yeah, that's it.

14:44.564 --> 14:45.864
Who were those dudes, man?

14:45.898 --> 14:48.266
They almost tried
to step to me, Kenny.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.601
Well, the littlest one
used to be my sidekick.

14:50.635 --> 14:51.702
And the big one, well,

14:51.737 --> 14:53.704
pretty much just
pissed me off all the time.

14:53.738 --> 14:55.205
Did they say
where they found him?

14:55.239 --> 14:56.439
Wait, wait. Sidekick?

14:56.473 --> 14:58.874
So you were down here
with another sidekick?

14:58.909 --> 15:00.676
How long were you working
with him?

15:00.710 --> 15:03.178
Pull your head out of your ass,
dipshit. This is important.

15:03.213 --> 15:07.082
I didn't just come to Mexico to
get drunk and fuck prostitutes.

15:07.116 --> 15:09.017
I mean, you know,
I came here for that,

15:09.051 --> 15:11.719
but I also came here
for something else too.

15:11.753 --> 15:16.289
I came here looking for a man
by the name of Eduardo.

15:16.323 --> 15:17.657
And who is he?

15:17.691 --> 15:19.124
Well,

15:19.159 --> 15:21.193
it's really more
of a personal quest.

15:21.227 --> 15:24.195
I'm not trying to pull a bunch
of other people involved.

15:24.230 --> 15:27.064
Oh, but you'll put a little
troll on the case, huh?

15:27.099 --> 15:29.367
Listen, man, don't get
your feelings hurt, all right?

15:29.401 --> 15:32.402
I came to Mexico
to find answers.

15:32.436 --> 15:35.438
I thought maybe Eduardo
would hold those answers.

15:35.472 --> 15:38.340
Maybe he still does.

15:41.677 --> 15:44.612
Testing, testing, testing.

15:44.647 --> 15:47.549
Batteries working on here.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.284
Tone.

15:49.318 --> 15:51.819
<i>Finally all the pieces
are falling together.</i>

15:51.854 --> 15:53.521
<i>All the answers I've been
searching for</i>

15:53.555 --> 15:56.089
<i>are on the verge
of totally being answered.</i>

15:56.124 --> 15:57.924
<i>I put in the goddamn man hours.</i>

15:57.958 --> 16:01.527
<i>Fucking muscles,
the sweats, the tears.</i>

16:01.561 --> 16:05.363
<i>Now it's my turn.
I got this country wet.</i>

16:05.397 --> 16:09.967
<i>Now it's time to bend this
bitch over and make her cum.</i>

16:10.001 --> 16:11.902
When you talk to these people,
my friend.

16:11.936 --> 16:13.203
Yes.
You gotta make sure

16:13.237 --> 16:15.138
you talk to all of them.
Okay.

16:17.374 --> 16:20.442
Kenny Powers! The Charros.
Kenny Powers!

16:20.476 --> 16:22.911
<i>Villagers and townspeople,</i>

16:22.945 --> 16:26.481
<i>come see Kenny Powers destroy
the competition in Mexico.</i>

16:26.515 --> 16:31.083
He's a national gift from the
good people of America to you.

16:31.118 --> 16:32.251
Cheer for him.

16:32.285 --> 16:35.887
<i>Bow to him. Worship him.</i>

16:35.922 --> 16:37.122
<i>Kenny Powers,</i>

16:37.156 --> 16:39.124
he's the White Flame,

16:39.158 --> 16:43.060

to the fucking ground.

16:43.095 --> 16:47.331
The White Flame,
Mr. Kenny fucking Powers.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.411
All right. Come on.

17:02.445 --> 17:06.146
Get these people
on their fucking feet, Powers.

17:10.819 --> 17:14.787
Goddamn. What, is this fucking
crowd full of dead people?

17:14.820 --> 17:17.489
Get on your feet,
you motherfuckers. Come on.

17:18.724 --> 17:20.625
Fucking ingrates.

17:20.659 --> 17:24.661
Hey, Powers! Hurry up,
so we can go get fucked up.

17:26.396 --> 17:28.698
I know this motherfucker
ain't trying to distract me.

17:28.732 --> 17:33.202
Hey, Kenny. Nobody gives a shit
for you over here in Mexico.

17:35.004 --> 17:37.171
<i>Hey, silencio, por favor.</i>

17:37.206 --> 17:39.173
Come on, Powders.

17:39.207 --> 17:41.375
We could have fucked
all the Tecate girls already.

17:43.377 --> 17:46.444
What are you waiting for?
The major leagues to call you.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.180
What you got
to say n, motherfucker?

17:49.215 --> 17:52.215
You really want to do this?
You really want to do this?

17:52.249 --> 17:55.118
Come on, tough guy. You want
to be a motherfucking tough guy?

17:55.152 --> 17:57.019
Come on!

17:58.455 --> 18:00.055
No, no, no!

18:10.565 --> 18:11.731
What are you doing?

18:21.775 --> 18:24.376
Finally, motherfuckers.
Finally!

18:24.410 --> 18:27.612
Yes! On your feet. Whoo!

18:27.646 --> 18:28.813

touch dicks, all right?

18:48.864 --> 18:50.231
Ugh.

18:50.265 --> 18:51.865
Kenny Powers and Barack Obama

18:51.900 --> 18:54.735

It's about time you Latinos
rose to the occasion.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.774
<i>Sign, La Flama Blanca.</i>

19:03.808 --> 19:06.477
Why you keep calling me that?
I don't know what that means.

19:06.511 --> 19:09.112
It means you, White Flame.

19:09.147 --> 19:11.148
Me? White Flame?

19:11.183 --> 19:12.483
No, dude.
That's lame as shit.

19:12.517 --> 19:13.884
Where the fuck
did you hear that?

19:13.919 --> 19:17.454
Stupid kid probably just
made that up, so fuck it.

19:17.488 --> 19:19.255
Now, listen here, little hombre.

19:19.290 --> 19:20.890
I'll give you my autograph,

19:20.924 --> 19:23.458
but thou shall not fuck up
my branding. Do you hear me?

19:23.493 --> 19:25.760
I'm wearing all black.
All right?

19:25.794 --> 19:27.094
Outlaws wear black.

19:27.128 --> 19:30.964
Fags and cocaine dealers
wear white. Give me that ball.

19:30.998 --> 19:35.101
<i>Let's see here.
How you say black in Español?</i>

19:35.135 --> 19:36.835

You said it, not me.

<i>Negro hombre.</i>

<i>None of the this La Flama

19:47.511 --> 19:52.047
<i>Me es Negro, guys.
I'm a negro. Capiche?</i>

19:52.081 --> 19:54.549
<i>You don't even know
what capiche means, do you?</i>

19:54.584 --> 19:56.050
That's because that's Russian.

19:56.085 --> 19:58.686
What the fuck is on your hand?

19:58.720 --> 20:00.187
Uh...fuck this.

20:00.222 --> 20:01.889
I don't know
how that got there.

20:01.923 --> 20:03.523
Goodbye, White Flame.

20:03.558 --> 20:04.625
No, did...?

20:04.659 --> 20:06.827
Did you not just hear
what I said?

20:09.797 --> 20:10.998
Miss you, buddy.

20:12.334 --> 20:14.834
So who's buried here?

20:14.869 --> 20:16.769
Just an old friend.

20:16.803 --> 20:18.637
Yo, man!

20:18.671 --> 20:20.905
<i>Buenos días.</i>

20:20.939 --> 20:22.973
<i>Buenos días,
backstabbing motherfuckers.</i>

20:23.007 --> 20:25.708
So I understand you all have
found the man Eduardo Sanchez.

20:25.743 --> 20:27.977
Is this true?
Yes, we find him.

20:28.011 --> 20:29.778
It's found.
It's past tense, munchkin.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.647
Hey, hey, come on, easy.

20:32.682 --> 20:34.115
This is a simple transaction.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.184
There's no reason
for anybody to get cut, okay?

20:36.218 --> 20:39.254
Lower the scissors and the tiny
blade. Please. Lower them.

20:39.288 --> 20:41.656
Tell your bitch
to stop sassing me.

20:41.691 --> 20:43.625
I am not his bitch.

20:43.659 --> 20:45.360
Just shh, all right?

20:45.394 --> 20:46.928
No reason to fucking bicker.

20:46.963 --> 20:49.331
At one point, both of y'all
were my bitches, so it's fine.

20:49.365 --> 20:51.933
You can bond on that. You don't
be at each other's throats.

20:51.968 --> 20:54.269
Just give me and Hector
some money

20:54.303 --> 20:56.037
and we'll give you the address.

21:01.210 --> 21:03.578
- We're keeping the pillowcase.
- Yes

21:03.612 --> 21:06.712
Fucking sleep on it.
Let me have the money first.

21:06.746 --> 21:08.480
Good, we will keep it.

21:08.515 --> 21:10.048
How much is that?

21:10.083 --> 21:11.683
About $40.

21:11.718 --> 21:13.919
Forty dollars?

21:13.954 --> 21:15.320
That's not $40.

21:15.355 --> 21:16.888
Forty bucks is all
you're gonna get.

21:16.923 --> 21:18.821
Just give us
the fucking address. Come on.

21:24.694 --> 21:25.994
What the fuck is this?

21:27.029 --> 21:28.163
Hello, hello?

21:28.197 --> 21:29.931
The hell is his saying?
Hello?

21:29.965 --> 21:32.833
Phone book, motherfucker,
phone book.

21:32.867 --> 21:34.935
Hector thinks he might
be in there somewhere.

21:36.204 --> 21:37.404
You motherfuckers.

21:37.438 --> 21:38.672
Whoa!

21:40.641 --> 21:42.108
So you roll me twice, huh?

21:42.143 --> 21:45.379
Why don't you go back home
where you belong?

21:45.413 --> 21:47.147
Why do you keep
telling me to go home?

21:47.181 --> 21:49.683
Where the fuck are you from?
You're not from Mexico.

21:49.717 --> 21:51.652
I'm from the streets of Bombay.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.820
Mexico is the place
where the gold is.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.355
Well, I haven't seen
any fucking gold around here.

21:56.389 --> 21:59.191
Follow the yellow-brick road.
Ha-ha-ha!

21:59.225 --> 22:01.359
Maybe I'll find the Ewok village
you came from.

22:01.393 --> 22:04.328
You got it wrong, buddy.
I'm Yoda.

22:04.363 --> 22:06.731
Why don't you two charlatans
just get the hell out of here

22:06.765 --> 22:08.799
before I rip that fake moustache
off your face.

22:10.902 --> 22:14.970
I always carry two. Always.

22:16.372 --> 22:19.307
<i>Vamanos, Hector.
Vamanos. Ha-ha-ha!</i>

22:19.342 --> 22:21.041
Fuck.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.677
I'm the king!

22:24.711 --> 22:26.378
Of what, motherfucker?
Of moustaches?

22:26.412 --> 22:29.046
Fucking motherfuckers.
Fuck. Fuck.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.349
Nice pants. Where'd you
get them at, Gap Baby?

22:31.383 --> 22:33.484
Don't fall in the river
and someone mistake you

22:33.518 --> 22:35.185
for a fucking floating turd.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.888
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you too, bitch.

22:37.922 --> 22:39.122
Goddamn it.

22:39.156 --> 22:41.257
Oh, fuck.
It was my fault, dude.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.726
Should have never
trusted a man that size.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.894
So who is Eduardo Sanchez?

22:45.928 --> 22:48.563
Doesn't matter anymore, Stevie.
Doesn't matter.

22:48.597 --> 22:50.631
He's a mystery
best left for another day.

22:50.666 --> 22:53.434
It matters to me, okay?
I... It's important.

22:53.468 --> 22:55.068
Tell me. I deserve to know,
Kenny.

22:55.102 --> 22:57.904
And because you just tried
to speak to me like a man,

22:57.938 --> 22:59.072
now you'll never know.

22:59.106 --> 23:00.540
So have fun being curious.

23:00.574 --> 23:02.241
I won't be able
to fucking sleep

23:02.276 --> 23:04.109
without knowing
who Eduardo Sanchez is.

23:04.143 --> 23:05.744
None of it matters anymore,
Stevie.

23:05.778 --> 23:08.846
I've found
what I'm looking for.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.352
Thank you for bringing us
to the carnival, Kenny.

23:16.386 --> 23:18.320
Yeah, no problem. If y'all
want any more tacos

23:18.354 --> 23:20.622
or churros or popcorns,
anything,

23:20.657 --> 23:22.291
you just let me know,
I'll get you more.

23:22.325 --> 23:23.759
I think we're fine.
Thank you.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.161
You should also be
thanking me for these tacos.

23:26.195 --> 23:27.462
These seem like the deal.

23:27.496 --> 23:29.464
Although I wonder

23:29.498 --> 23:31.766
if I'm gonna get Montezuma's
Revenge from this shit.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.400
You're gonna be fine.

23:33.435 --> 23:35.002
They wash their hands
and stuff here?

23:35.036 --> 23:36.270
Of course.

23:36.304 --> 23:38.639
Do you know what Montezuma's
Revenge is, Tony?

23:38.673 --> 23:40.774
It's when a white man
shits his pants in Mexico.

23:40.808 --> 23:43.609
- Most of the time.
- Yeah.

23:43.644 --> 23:45.378
Vida, there's something
super serious

23:45.412 --> 23:47.513
I'd like to talk to you two
about, if that's okay.

23:47.547 --> 23:48.714
Okay.

23:48.748 --> 23:50.615
Can you take the computers
out of your ears?

23:50.650 --> 23:53.151
<i>Tony, take the computers
out of los ojos.</i>

23:53.185 --> 23:55.186
Just take your head...
Headphones down.

23:55.221 --> 23:57.889
Take them out of the earos.
Thank you.

23:57.923 --> 24:00.824
Well, it's no mystery
that I'm damaged goods.

24:00.859 --> 24:02.425
I think you guys
both know that.

24:02.460 --> 24:04.959
I've told you all that
countless times.

24:04.993 --> 24:08.328
And it's also no secret that
it's been pretty hard for me

24:08.362 --> 24:10.396
to get over my old girl
back in the States.

24:10.430 --> 24:13.465
I mean you know that.
I've talked to you about it.

24:13.499 --> 24:16.735
Cried about it.
You know.

24:16.769 --> 24:19.404
But I'm starting to realize
that maybe it's time I wake up

24:19.438 --> 24:22.673
and see that ship has sailed,

24:22.707 --> 24:24.808
and now a new ship
has come into port.

24:24.842 --> 24:27.978
A pirate ship,
carrying some incredible bootie.

24:29.180 --> 24:30.614
Tony's here.

24:30.648 --> 24:32.983
Yeah, I know he's here.
I want him to hear this.

24:33.017 --> 24:34.984
Tony, I'm gonna talk to you
like a man now, okay?

24:35.018 --> 24:37.152
Is that cool?
Okay.

24:37.186 --> 24:39.454
I have serious fucking feelings
for your mom, dude.

24:39.488 --> 24:41.788
I'm madly in love with her.

24:41.822 --> 24:44.090
I've never,

24:44.124 --> 24:48.125
never have ever felt like this
for anyone before.

24:48.160 --> 24:52.062
Vida, baby, I'm ready to say
fuck the past

24:52.096 --> 24:53.463
and commit to you right now.

24:53.498 --> 24:56.232
I'm ready to commit
to the both of you if I have to.

24:56.267 --> 24:58.034
You don't need to commit to us.

24:58.068 --> 25:01.802
We are just having fun
and you can take it slow.

25:01.836 --> 25:05.940
No, I've taken it slow before
and it did not work out so good.

25:05.975 --> 25:07.675
So I'm doing shit different
this time.

25:07.710 --> 25:10.177
I'm taking it super fast. Tony.

25:10.211 --> 25:12.612
Yes.
From this moment forward,

25:12.646 --> 25:15.414
I want you to consider me
your father figure.

25:15.449 --> 25:17.350
Tadow. Raise it up.

25:17.384 --> 25:18.418
Father figure.

25:18.453 --> 25:19.887
He doesn't need that.

25:19.922 --> 25:21.789
Shh, shh, shh.

25:21.823 --> 25:23.958
If this is gonna work for real,

25:23.992 --> 25:26.394
then we can no longer
walk around

25:26.428 --> 25:28.062
and pretend
like he doesn't exist.

25:28.096 --> 25:29.830
He does exist, Vida.

25:29.864 --> 25:33.165
He's real and he's here
and he's right in front of us.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.767
You matter to us now, Tony.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.202
You matter to both of us now.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.972
Who wants to go
on this roller coaster ride?

25:43.140 --> 25:45.508
Sure, I want to have fun.

25:45.542 --> 25:48.243
Fun begins now. Boom.

25:48.278 --> 25:50.212
Let's do this shit, shall we?

25:50.246 --> 25:51.780
Okay.

25:52.882 --> 25:54.415
Tacos. Let's go.
