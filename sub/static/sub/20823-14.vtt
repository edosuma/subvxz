WEBVTT

00:07.260 --> 00:10.343
- The answer is no.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.209
I just got out of a
relationship, I don't wanna date

00:12.270 --> 00:14.522
anyone right now.

00:14.570 --> 00:17.698
He's a nice guy. What's the harm
in meeting him?
- He's a cop.

00:17.750 --> 00:20.310
- He's not a cop, he's
a forensic pathologist.
Good-looking, too.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.965
There is the whole
drooling thing, but...

00:23.020 --> 00:25.318
- [You're trying to set me up
with a guy who drools
over dead bodies

00:25.370 --> 00:27.361
- OK, if you're gonna
put it that way...

00:27.410 --> 00:29.674
- Hold on, there's someone
at the door.

00:29.720 --> 00:32.234
Oh, hey! I'm on the phone
with Maz.

00:32.290 --> 00:36.465
]
- My... UberEATS just arrived.

00:36.510 --> 00:39.115
- Why did you tell them you were
on the phone with me?

00:39.160 --> 00:42.243
is getting cold. I mean warm.
I'll call you later.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.996
Sila, what's going on?
- You have to help me.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.089
But please don't tell Maz about
this, we got into a giant,
awful fight

00:48.130 --> 00:50.826
about me moving in with Jordan
and now we're not even talking.
Oh my God, I can't breathe!

00:50.870 --> 00:52.735
- OK, calm down.
Just tell me what happened.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.350
- Somebody took Leroy.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.703
- Yep.

01:00.750 --> 01:03.059
- Yep.

01:03.100 --> 01:04.886
- Oh, there he is! He's out!

01:04.930 --> 01:06.966
- Hold on. Ahh!

01:07.020 --> 01:10.490
Over there. There he goes.

01:10.540 --> 01:13.418
- There he is, there he is!
I've got him, I've got him!
Aha, gotcha!

01:13.460 --> 01:15.325
- Attaboy, Liam!

01:15.370 --> 01:18.544
Alright, here we go.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.546
Here we go. Look at that. Ugh!

01:21.600 --> 01:24.592
One live mouse.
- I don't know,

01:24.640 --> 01:26.596
let him go in the back alley
or something?
- Yeah.

01:26.650 --> 01:30.518
Oh, that's my mom.
I gotta go. Oh, hey!

01:30.560 --> 01:34.121
I saw that Phoenix was coming to
the Masonic Temple this spring

01:34.180 --> 01:36.080
and you'll be back from Italy
by then. Should I grab
some tickets?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.439
- Uh...

01:38.480 --> 01:41.267
- They're going on sale tomorrow
and they'll sell out
pretty quick.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.743
- Cool. Um, maybe.
I'll let you know, OK?

01:42.790 --> 01:45.350
- Yeah, of course. See ya.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.356
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye, Mr. Shade.

01:47.410 --> 01:50.402
- Bye, Liam.
- Bye!

01:50.450 --> 01:52.668
I thought you liked Phoenix.

01:52.720 --> 01:56.065
- I don't... I don't know. I'm
leaving for Italy in a month.

01:56.110 --> 01:58.806
It feels weird to make plans
so far ahead.

01:58.850 --> 02:01.637
Who knows what I'll be
interested in by then?
- Yeah, right.

02:03.810 --> 02:07.428
Gotta meet Angie downtown. New
case. Um, Grandpa's around here

02:07.470 --> 02:09.904
somewhere. Will you be OK?
- Yeah, go, go.

02:11.910 --> 02:14.470
How you doing there, bud?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.532
- Man, I love this place.
Our client works here?

02:32.580 --> 02:35.583
- She's the lead marine
biologist and head of research

02:35.630 --> 02:38.326
and conservation, and also--
- Angie!

02:38.370 --> 02:40.838
Oh, thank you so much
for coming!

02:40.890 --> 02:43.063
You must be Matt Shade.
Hi. I'm Dr. Sila Mazhari.

02:43.110 --> 02:46.113
- Oh, that's funny.
We know a Mazhari.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.982
You're related to him,
aren't you?
- Yes.

02:50.030 --> 02:52.726
- She's Maz's sister.
- No.

02:52.780 --> 02:54.907
I don't want him
involved in this.

02:54.950 --> 02:56.599
- I usually feel the same way.
So, what's the problem?

02:56.650 --> 03:00.211
- Leroy's gone.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.911
- No.
- No. Leroy

03:02.960 --> 03:05.133
is an octopus.

03:05.180 --> 03:08.650
- An octopus!

03:08.710 --> 03:11.520
Your text didn't mention that.
- Surprise!

03:14.280 --> 03:18.842
- I see you and you see me

03:18.890 --> 03:22.109
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene

03:22.150 --> 03:25.847
Oh boy, you've got to know

03:25.900 --> 03:28.061
What my head overlooks

03:28.120 --> 03:30.987
The senses will show
to my heart

03:31.030 --> 03:33.112
When it's watching for lies

03:33.160 --> 03:36.550
'Cause you can't escape my

03:36.600 --> 03:38.465
Private Eyes

03:38.520 --> 03:40.511
They're watching you

03:40.560 --> 03:42.949
Private Eyes

03:43.000 --> 03:44.956
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

03:45.000 --> 03:49.004
Watching you

03:52.970 --> 03:54.961
- Why would anyone

03:55.010 --> 03:57.444
steal an octopus?
- Leroy is more

03:57.490 --> 04:00.232
than just an octopus.
He's an Enteroctopus Ibakaan.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.919
- You don't say.
- He was found 3 weeks ago

04:02.980 --> 04:05.232
off the shore of North Korea.
I petitioned to have him

04:05.280 --> 04:08.022
sent here. His species is
on the brink of extinction.

04:08.070 --> 04:11.198
- Prior to finding Leroy, one.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.195
- A female named Sally.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.411
She's at an aquarium
in Australia.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.813
We transported Leroy here
for conservation purposes.

04:17.860 --> 04:21.330
I studied his species for my PhD
dissertation, but the research

04:21.390 --> 04:23.813
that my team and I have
uncovered is, like... poof!

04:23.870 --> 04:25.997
- Well, through some
blood tests,

04:26.040 --> 04:28.827
we were able to isolate the
nuclear membrane of his DNA

04:28.870 --> 04:30.826
and the way the microtubules
attach to the chromosomes and--

04:30.870 --> 04:34.567
- Uh, words we understand.
- Right, um, OK.

04:34.620 --> 04:37.009
Leroy has regenerative
capabilities

04:37.050 --> 04:39.132
unlike any other
creature on earth.

04:39.190 --> 04:41.966
It takes a starfish up to a year
to regenerate a severed arm.

04:42.020 --> 04:45.057
Leroy can regrow a new tentacle
in just a few weeks.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.055
- Is the Australian aquarium
aware of your findings?

04:47.110 --> 04:49.624
- Sally's on her way here
as we speak.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.671
- Let me guess: you're hoping
for a love connection.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.415
- If we can get them to mate,

04:53.460 --> 04:55.246
we can bring an entire species
back from the dead.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.993
The tank was right there. The
thieves came in through the door

05:05.040 --> 05:07.736
and took it out with them.

05:07.780 --> 05:10.340
- At least 300 gallons.
- That's a lot of weight.

05:10.390 --> 05:13.041
- It was on _wheels. We were
slowly trying to Introduce

05:13.090 --> 05:16.309
new elements of his habitat
to break him in.

05:16.350 --> 05:20.263
- Out front_. Tallulah the sea
turtle's being shipped off to
Puttner Aquarium to make room.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.357
My God, Angie,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.571
what am I gonna do? I mean,
we were setting him up

05:25.620 --> 05:27.963
to have his own YouTube channel.
Sally had one in Australia

05:28.020 --> 05:30.363
that became super popular, 50--
- Calm down.

05:30.410 --> 05:32.583
Don't worry. If he's out there,
we're gonna find him.

05:32.630 --> 05:36.509
Are you sure you don't wanna
bring Maz in on this?
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:36.550 --> 05:38.984
I can't. If he gets involved,
it just becomes a whole thing

05:39.030 --> 05:41.635
and the press will find out,
and we have to keep this quiet.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.819
- OK.
- Hey, this security
camera here,

05:43.860 --> 05:47.648
is it recording?
- Yes!

05:50.040 --> 05:52.292
Henry, I'm coming your way,
if you can cue up the
surveillance footage.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.739
- So, what's the story
with her and Maz?

05:54.780 --> 05:57.431
- Oh, he's less than thrilled
that his little sister moved in

05:57.480 --> 05:59.436
with her boyfriend after
only knowing him 3 months.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.823
Jordan's basically her first
serious relationship.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.007
- Yeah, she fast-tracked

06:04.050 --> 06:06.359
through school, had two PhDs
by the time she was 26.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.618
Boyfriends weren't
exactly a priority.

06:08.670 --> 06:10.444
- Hey, believe me, I understand
where Maz is coming from,

06:10.500 --> 06:13.139
but she is an adult.

06:13.190 --> 06:15.329
- It's just around the corner.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.326
- There's more to it,
but I'll tell you later.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.589
- This is Henry, one of our
security guards. Henry,

06:20.640 --> 06:22.449
these are some friends of mine.
They're gonna help us
find Leroy.

06:22.510 --> 06:25.206
Can you show them the footage?
- Such as it is,

06:25.250 --> 06:27.423
the thieves hacked our system.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.938
This is all I have.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.683
- Can't even make out the plate.

06:35.740 --> 06:38.083
- See, he gets his computer

06:38.130 --> 06:40.519
and then... blackout.

06:40.570 --> 06:43.789
- Professional job.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.435
- Dr. Sandoval,
what are you doing here?
- I get notified every time

06:46.490 --> 06:50.005
our security alarm goes off.
Henry filled me in. How could
this have happened?

06:50.060 --> 06:53.097
- We're still trying
to figure that out.

06:53.150 --> 06:55.015
- This is Angie Everett and her
partner Matt Shade. They're
private investigators.

06:55.060 --> 06:58.109
Shouldn't we
have called the police?

06:58.150 --> 07:01.142
- I thought it was best if we
just kept the theft quiet
until we knew more.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.589
- Actually, that's smart.
- Fred Gusev.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.019
Chairman of the Board of
Directors. I was having dinner

07:07.070 --> 07:09.026
with Dr. Sandoval
when she got the call.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.469
- Please, sir, can I ask you not
to say anything to the board

07:11.510 --> 07:14.206
about this?
- It's gonna be apparent

07:14.250 --> 07:17.777
on Friday.
- There's an event planned.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.129
It's the grand unveiling of
Leroy and Sally's new habitat.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.126
- This mishap could cost
your department funding

07:22.180 --> 07:24.478
for next year, Dr. Mazhari.
That includes

07:24.530 --> 07:27.784
your salary.
- We were about to save
an entire specnes.

07:27.830 --> 07:30.139
I don't even care about my job
right now. I just wanna get
Leroy back safe--

07:30.180 --> 07:32.489
- OK, OK, everyone
just take a breath.

07:32.530 --> 07:35.272
The board doesn't meet
for 48 hours, if you can
track down Leroy

07:35.320 --> 07:38.539
within that time--
- We will.
- I hope so.

07:38.580 --> 07:41.014
This was your project,
Dr. Mazhari.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.972
The board allocated
nearly a million dollars
to your research,

07:44.020 --> 07:46.363
so this lies
on your shoulders.

07:53.730 --> 07:55.948
- Big promise you made.

07:55.990 --> 07:58.208
- I can't let Sila down.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.478
If she doesn't Maz
involved in the case,

08:00.520 --> 08:02.476
it's up to us
to get her out of this.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.511
- Yeah, about Maz...

08:04.570 --> 08:07.653
- His dad was a cop, undercover.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.656
He couldn't handle the stress.

08:09.700 --> 08:12.396
Maz doesn't like
to talk about it.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.659
- He had a nervous breakdown.
Yeah, he ended up
in the hospital.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.873
When he got out,
he just... left.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.148
Maz was in college at the time.
Sila was 13.

08:21.190 --> 08:24.182
It changed the relationship
between them.
- He became more of a dad

08:24.240 --> 08:27.323
than a brother.
- Exactly.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.326
- Alright, well,
let's work the angles.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.679
Why steal an octopus?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.632
- A very valuable, one-of-a-kind
octopus. What's your motivation?

08:34.680 --> 08:38.468
- You're an animal activist.
Free Leroy into the Wild.

08:38.510 --> 08:40.683
- Sil_a's a conservationist.
Her JOb is to save animals.

08:40.730 --> 08:42.686
Not to mention they left
all the others

08:42.730 --> 08:45.858
behind.
- You wanna strike a blow
against the facility,

08:45.910 --> 08:48.344
for some reason,
or Sila herself.

08:48.390 --> 08:50.301
Why bother removing

08:50.350 --> 08:53.137
the entire tank?
- Right. OK,

08:53.180 --> 08:56.172
so let's say I've stolen
this incredibly rare,

08:56.230 --> 08:59.097
almost extinct octopus
and I wanna sell it
for a lot of money.

08:59.140 --> 09:02.189
- How do you fence
a hot octopus?

09:09.110 --> 09:11.328
- Just so we're clear,

09:11.370 --> 09:13.418
this is the last place
Sila wanted us to come.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.281
- We don't have to
tell him who our client is.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.504
- Uh...
your last name

09:19.550 --> 09:22.724
is Mazhari.
- That's good, Shade.
You're finally learning.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.728
So what brings you two clowns
down here so_ late on
a school night?

09:25.780 --> 09:28.476
- Exotic animals.
- OK.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.250
I've been on a 15-hour shift.
This is...

09:31.300 --> 09:34.781
this is going to be great.

09:34.830 --> 09:37.742
- What can you tell us about
the illegal animal trade
in this city?

09:37.790 --> 09:40.611
- Well, wildlife trafficking

09:40.660 --> 09:43.743
is the fourth biggest black
market industry after drugs,
guns and people.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.099
Brings in 23 billion dollars
a year. Who did you say
your client was?

09:47.150 --> 09:49.789
- Between collectors,

09:49.850 --> 09:52.660
poachers, medical companies,
there's a long list of people

09:52.720 --> 09:56.235
who for some reason get
their kicks out of owning
exotic animals.

09:56.290 --> 09:59.066
- And how exactly does the trade
of said wildlife work?

09:59.120 --> 10:01.759
- Well, let's see.
On a local level,

10:01.810 --> 10:04.768
we've got 3 major importer-
exporters that we know about.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.856
They sell animals
at secret auctions.

10:06.910 --> 10:10.380
- It's easier said than done.

10:10.430 --> 10:13.695
They bounce around all over the
city. There is a taskforce who's
supposed to deal with this,

10:13.740 --> 10:15.696
but if you ask me,
the detective in charge

10:15.740 --> 10:18.391
is just coasting
until retirement.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.044
You didn't get that from me.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.703
So who's your client?
- Thanks, Maz. Gotta go.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.792
- I hear slippers.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.058
Are you still in your PJs?
-Iam.

10:34.110 --> 10:37.068
I had to work late on a case.
- Good morning.

10:37.110 --> 10:39.670
- So, um,
I was wondering...

10:39.720 --> 10:43.372
What was with you not wanting
to go to that concert

10:43.420 --> 10:46.241
with Liam?
- Well, I was thinking

10:46.290 --> 10:48.724
4 months is a long time
to do the distance thing,

10:48.770 --> 10:51.295
so maybe Liam and I
should take a break...

10:51.340 --> 10:53.467
as in break up.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.819
- I see.
- But the other part
of me doesn't want

10:56.870 --> 10:59.031
to lose him,
'cause he's great.

10:59.090 --> 11:02.389
- Right.
- So what do you think
I should do?

11:02.440 --> 11:06.137
- I think you should dump him.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.307
- Dad!
- Honey, I remember

11:08.360 --> 11:10.669
when I was your age. I got
called up to play Junior A,

11:10.710 --> 11:13.486
had to move across
the country. I broke up

11:13.540 --> 11:16.407
with my first girlfriend,
Christy. Turns out to be

11:16.450 --> 11:18.145
the best decision
I could've made.

11:18.190 --> 11:20.146
- Yeah. On my own,
I could focus on hockey,

11:20.200 --> 11:24.022
I didn't have to share myself
with someone who wasn't part
of my life anymore.

11:24.070 --> 11:26.982
- Yeah, maybe you're right.
Thanks, Dad.

11:30.250 --> 11:34.289
See you tonight.
- Hey, honey, what are we doing

11:34.340 --> 11:37.514
with the...?

11:43.610 --> 11:47.000
These are the importers
Maz told us about?
- Yeah.

11:47.050 --> 11:49.780
Anica Velic, Andrew Barker,
and Fung Ying Chow.

11:49.830 --> 11:52.958
- That's gonna take forever to
track each one of them down.
- Luckily,

11:53.010 --> 11:56.446
you won't have to.
I just got off the phone

11:56.490 --> 11:58.879
with my uncle's friend's
son-in-law's brother

11:58.930 --> 12:01.182
who runs an army surplus
store on Spadina.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.276
Apparently, they have a special
on gas masks right now--

12:03.330 --> 12:06.060
- Zoe, focus.
- Right.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.192
Uh, according to him,
all three importers

12:08.240 --> 12:10.458
distribute through
a woman named Elodie.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.331
- She runs a weekly
exotic pet auction

12:13.380 --> 12:16.201
in various places throughout
the city, but rumour has it

12:16.250 --> 12:19.515
there's one today in Chinatown.
- Suspicious timing.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.164
- Army surplus guy

12:21.210 --> 12:23.166
says to walk along Dundas

12:23.220 --> 12:24.949
and approach the men
standing on the street.

12:26.260 --> 12:29.047
Men who look like
they're waiting for you

12:29.090 --> 12:31.650
to walk up to them
-I'm not making this up-

12:31.700 --> 12:35.659
and say "Elodie",
then they'll take you to
where the auction's being held.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.793
- It's worth a shot.

12:41.060 --> 12:44.279
- Maybe we should wait until--

12:44.320 --> 12:46.493
As in,
marine biologist,

12:46.540 --> 12:50.624
octopus Sila? Shut the front
door, she's our client?

12:50.680 --> 12:53.899
- You can't say anything.
Just Maz.
- That's exactly who

12:53.940 --> 12:56.591
you can't tell.
- Zoe, promise you will not
spill the beans.

12:56.640 --> 12:59.859
- OK, look, here's the thing.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.504
I'm, like, really good
at keeping secrets

13:01.560 --> 13:03.551
and all that
from... strangers.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.818
But when it comes
to my inner Circle,

13:05.870 --> 13:07.861
truth comes flying out of me
like projectile vomit.
- Can't you just stay

13:07.910 --> 13:10.219
away from him for a few days?
- I totally would,

13:10.260 --> 13:13.138
except we're hanging out
tonight.

13:13.180 --> 13:16.786
I won't say anything. I promise.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.269
- Ugh, it's been an hour
and a half. I'm ready

13:28.320 --> 13:30.276
to buy a pork skewer
and call it a day.

13:30.330 --> 13:32.753
- No, come on,
we can't give up yet.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.153
OK, what about that guy?

13:37.250 --> 13:40.026
Hey. Elodie?

13:53.480 --> 13:56.176
: Yeah.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.949
- Follow me.

14:00.230 --> 14:03.870
: The opening
bid is $15,000 dollars.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.229
Excellent, we have 15,000.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.407
Now we have 16,000,

14:09.450 --> 14:11.406
gentleman with the red tie.

14:11.450 --> 14:14.533
Do we have 17,000?

14:14.590 --> 14:16.808
Do we have
any movement?

14:16.850 --> 14:19.580
- 17,000 for a Bengal
tiger puppy--

14:19.640 --> 14:22.803
- Excellent! We have 17,000

14:22.860 --> 14:26.330
from the gentleman
with the pretty lady.
- No, no, no, I was just--

14:26.380 --> 14:28.905
- Now we have 18,000.

14:28.950 --> 14:31.737
- Whew! that was close.
- Excellent!

14:31.780 --> 14:33.293
Gentleman raises it

14:33.350 --> 14:36.308
to 19,000!
- No, no, no, I--
- Stay still!

14:36.350 --> 14:38.124
- 19,000 going once,

14:38.180 --> 14:40.740
going twice...

14:40.790 --> 14:43.827
$20,000,

14:43.880 --> 14:46.781
gentleman with the sunglasses.
Do we have any movement?

14:46.840 --> 14:49.741
- Don't even breathe.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.358
- Sold!

14:51.410 --> 14:55.141
$20,000.

14:59.070 --> 15:02.107
- My name is Matt Shade. This is
my partner, Angie Everett.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.721
- We're not cops. We're here
about a missing octopus.
It was stolen

15:05.770 --> 15:09.069
from Ripley's Aquarium.
- How do you know
about the octopus?

15:09.120 --> 15:12.248
- It's been on the dark web
for the last 12 hours.

15:12.300 --> 15:15.258
- Guess our balaclava buddies
went looking for a buyer.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.088
Do you know who
ended up with it?

15:19.130 --> 15:21.951
- Because maybe I'll off some
friends at PETA about the little
party you're havmg down here.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.299
- Ketura got it.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.818
Of all people. On y va?

15:32.670 --> 15:35.013
Ketura...

15:35.060 --> 15:37.620
Why is that name familiar?

15:37.670 --> 15:40.889
Hm.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.579
- I'm texting Maz to tell him
who's running the underground
auctions.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.678
Maybe he knows someone
who can track footprints

15:45.720 --> 15:47.984
on the dark web.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.760
What's wrong?
- I knew I recognised that name.

15:50.810 --> 15:53.813
Ketura is a famous
underground chef.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.771
Leroy's about to become
someone's dinner.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.127
- Ketura goes by one name.
Wikipedia says

16:05.180 --> 16:06.989
she's a renegade chef
who hosts clandestine,

16:07.050 --> 16:09.268
exclusive, cutting-edge

16:09.310 --> 16:12.359
-I think they mean unethical-
pop-up feasts around the world.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.358
- I remember hearing rumours
of her infamous dinners
when I had my restaurant.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.961
The more rare and unethical,
the higher the price.
- Well, the good news is

16:19.020 --> 16:22.922
Ketura's famous for only using
the freshest of ingredients.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.198
- It means Leroy's
probably still alive.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.969
We just need to find out where
that dinner's being held.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.976
- I may know
a guy I can call.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.669
Julian Barrington.
He's a food critic.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.019
Gave my restaurant a scathing
review three weeks
after it opened.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.948
- "The meal was reminiscent
of Matt Shade's hockey career:

16:38.990 --> 16:42.335
sweaty, filled with errors,
but mercifully brief."

16:42.390 --> 16:44.950
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.036
Guy had it in for me
after I called him a poser

16:47.090 --> 16:49.046
on live TV.
- You really had a way

16:49.090 --> 16:51.524
with people back then.

16:53.570 --> 16:57.313
- I drive by your old restaurant
every now and then.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.443
It's a shoe repair shop now,
yet the aroma still reminds me

17:00.490 --> 17:03.573
of your place.
- Ha, ha, ha! That's funny.
You know, I'm actually thinking

17:03.630 --> 17:05.575
of getting back into
the restaurant business.

17:05.630 --> 17:08.019
- My palate quivers
with anticipation.

17:08.070 --> 17:10.630
- More of a sideline
this time.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.581
- Oh, yes, because running a
restaurant is a lovely
hobby to take up.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.803
- I'm thinking of doing it more
in a pop-up style, like Ketura.

17:16.860 --> 17:19.420
That's why I'd really like
to attend that dinner
of hers tonight.

17:19.470 --> 17:21.506
- You'll never get into
that dinner, it's sold out.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.290
Besides, tickets
are $5,000 each.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.945
i
- For a once_-in-a-lifetime
experience?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.956
Absolutely.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.343
Luckily, my ticket was comped.

17:31.390 --> 17:34.132
- I don't believe you.
Let me see it.

17:34.180 --> 17:37.263
- How _mature.
- Seriously.

17:37.310 --> 17:40.097
You're not being flown to
restaurant openings anymore.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.449
You've become a little bit...
What's the word?

17:42.490 --> 17:44.958
Pass,

17:45.020 --> 17:47.011
in the food
critic world.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.312
- Here.

17:49.370 --> 17:51.065
See for yourself.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.408
- Wow. Look at that.

17:56.460 --> 18:00.066
1235 Mill Street.
Is that a restaurant?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.681
- You'll never know.
I'm the closest you'll
ever get to that dinner.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.309
- Bonsoir, madame.
You're here for...?

18:25.360 --> 18:28.147
- Ketura's 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea dinner experience.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.919
- Right this way.

18:33.930 --> 18:37.104
- Copy that, Ketura.
Name, please.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.061
- Dubowski. Mr. and Mrs.

18:39.110 --> 18:41.988
- The Dubowskis have arrived.
Very well, ma'am. Tickets,

18:42.030 --> 18:45.898
please.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.942
Right away.

18:48.990 --> 18:51.857
If you just take the door
on the side of this building

18:51.910 --> 18:53.866
downstairs to the
underground parking,

18:53.910 --> 18:55.958
one of Ketura's assistants
Will greet you.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.082
- Cover, I love it. Have you
been inside the venue?

18:58.130 --> 19:01.736
- It's everything
you deserve and more.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.564
- Oh no, I'll process them here.
But you do need a password.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.520
: Leroy.

19:05.570 --> 19:09.188
: Leroy. Leroy.

19:09.230 --> 19:12.358
- Have a nice night.
- Enjoy.

19:14.580 --> 19:17.879
- Long enough for us to get in
and get out.

19:22.630 --> 19:24.939
- Oh, I spoke to Sila before
we left. If we find Leroy,

19:24.980 --> 19:27.767
we can lure him into this thing.
- How's he supposed
to fit in here?

19:27.810 --> 19:29.721
- Apparently octopuses
don't have bones,

19:29.770 --> 19:31.988
so they can fit into
really tiny spaces.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.725
- Clearly the thieves weren't
well-versed in octopus
physiology.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.771
Do I really have to carry
around a huge man purse?

19:38.740 --> 19:40.696
An entire species depends on it.

19:48.530 --> 19:52.227
- Hi!
- I'm happy to see you too.
- Sorry,

19:52.270 --> 19:55.444
you scared me. I thought we were
meeting at the restaurant.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.708
- Yeah, but I got off work
early, so I figured

19:57.760 --> 20:01.799
I'd pick you up.
- Hm, great. Amazing.

20:01.850 --> 20:05.104
That's so... thoughtful.
I am just going to...

20:05.160 --> 20:07.105
clean up a little bit.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.583
Real quick.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.598
- I'm...

20:12.640 --> 20:15.427
a weirdo. Just comes
with the territory.

20:15.470 --> 20:17.426
- Touch.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.426
What is all this stuff?

20:19.470 --> 20:21.904
What are you taking down?

20:21.950 --> 20:24.475
- I have to go to the bathroom.

20:28.220 --> 20:31.178
What's going on here?
What aren't you telling me?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.915
- Nothing.

20:33.970 --> 20:35.699
- Come on.

20:38.190 --> 20:40.795
- Our client is Sila, your
sister. She made Shade and Angie

20:40.840 --> 20:43.149
promise not to tell you
and... now Ijust did,
so maybe I'm fired.

20:43.190 --> 20:46.580
What's going on
with my sister?

20:58.770 --> 21:00.681
- Ah! Thank you.

21:00.730 --> 21:04.382
- OK, we need to get
to the kitchen.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.478
- Welcome, everyone.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.829
Please,

21:08.870 --> 21:10.781
please. Take your seats.

21:22.580 --> 21:25.367
Thank you for joining me.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.186
It is my privilege, my honor,

21:28.240 --> 21:30.367
to feed you this evening.

21:30.410 --> 21:32.412
I hope you all brought
your appetite.

21:32.460 --> 21:36.328
May I present
the first course? Fugu,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.940
also known as pufferfish.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.333
Delicious on the tongue,

21:41.380 --> 21:44.167
but deadly if prepared
incorrectly.

21:44.210 --> 21:47.338
You must train for two years
before taking a rigorous test

21:47.390 --> 21:50.905
in which one third
of all applicants fail.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.599
Don't worry, I passed.

21:53.660 --> 21:57.130
And for the main course...

21:59.400 --> 22:01.174
In our kitchen right now,

22:01.230 --> 22:04.006
a truly rare treat.

22:04.060 --> 22:06.620
A species of octopus known

22:06.670 --> 22:08.626
for its incredible--
- Now's our chance to get
to the kitchen

22:08.670 --> 22:10.752
while she's still talking.
- It can grow a new tentacle

22:10.800 --> 22:13.678
in just... Uh,

22:13.720 --> 22:18.453
sorry, can I help you?
- Oh, just going
to the bathroom.

22:18.510 --> 22:21.673
- That's the kitchen.
You can't go in there.
- Oh, we won't be a minute.

22:21.730 --> 22:24.290
- Sorry to spoil your supper,
but could everyone please
put their hands in the air?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.909
Did I stutter? Drop the fork.

22:28.950 --> 22:31.259
Nobody messes with
my sister's octopus.

22:31.300 --> 22:34.827
- Turn around, please.
Turn around. Go!

22:36.960 --> 22:39.781
Ketura, you are under arrest for
the entrapment and endangerment

22:39.830 --> 22:42.390
of a protected marine wildlife.

22:46.360 --> 22:49.579
- It's not here.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.054
Uh-oh.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.978
Oh...

22:55.020 --> 22:57.329
- Leroy.

23:05.380 --> 23:08.463
- Oh!
- Get your own!

23:08.510 --> 23:11.593
There's like 5 chips
in here and I'm starving.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.518
- So, Jules is
breaking up with Liam.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.733
How come?

23:17.780 --> 23:20.385
- She wants to make a clean
break before Italy, you know,
really immerse herself

23:20.440 --> 23:22.522
in the culture. I thought
it was a great idea.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.787
- No reason. I mean,
Liam's awesome, right,

23:28.840 --> 23:31.570
but so is being young and free.
I remember spending time

23:31.620 --> 23:33.576
in France by myself.
- Right,

23:33.620 --> 23:36.054
taking in the streets,
the museums, the people,

23:36.110 --> 23:39.056
without being tethered
to someone across the ocean.

23:39.110 --> 23:42.364
- More like spending time with
Nico, the artist who lived in
the troisime arrondissement.

23:42.420 --> 23:46.538
Oh, and there was Pascal,
that weekend in Montpellier.

23:48.810 --> 23:51.859
I need to talk to Jules,

23:51.900 --> 23:54.778
make sure she's not making
any rash decisions.

23:54.820 --> 23:57.948
- Not so fast. You,
you're in the bad books.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.730
- She made me promise, Maz,
and my client has a right

24:00.780 --> 24:03.601
to her anonymity.
- Not when your client
is my little sister.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.868
- We're not in grade school.
Sila's a grown woman, she can
make her own decisions.

24:05.920 --> 24:09.083
- Can we talk about that later,
please? For now, I just thought
you'd like to know

24:09.140 --> 24:11.358
that in addition to trafficking
in illegal animals,

24:11.400 --> 24:13.618
Ketura is also a fraud.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.571
- She found out

24:15.620 --> 24:17.838
Leroy was stolen
through back channels.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.108
She took credit for the theft
in order to profit from it.

24:20.150 --> 24:23.449
- Not Leroy. St. Lawrence
Market, 80 bucks.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.195
- Some other octopus.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.765
- Sally.

24:27.810 --> 24:31.371
It was footage from her webcam.
- I'm sorry, you know an octopus
named Sally with a webcam?

24:31.420 --> 24:34.639
OK, you know what, I don't care.
The point is you should've
brought me in earlier.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.113
- I get it.
We need to talk to Sila.
- And this time I'll be there.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.647
You just leave your garbage
on my desk?

24:40.690 --> 24:43.682
- I don't care!
- You know, I do happen
to be a cop

24:43.740 --> 24:47.119
that specializes in break-ins
and thefts. You should've
contacted me first.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.786
- I didn't want your help. You
cut me out, so I cut you out.

24:50.830 --> 24:52.786
- I didn't cut you out, you just
don't know how to listen.

24:52.830 --> 24:55.003
- Well, now you sound like Mom.
- Speaking of Mom,

24:55.050 --> 24:57.132
did you tell her you moved in
with a guy you met on Bumble

24:57.190 --> 24:59.533
three months ago?
Get over it!

24:59.580 --> 25:02.367
- Whole life has been devoted

25:02.410 --> 25:04.628
to her work; one guy
swipes right and it goes
right out the window.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.718
- What's really
the problem, here?

25:06.760 --> 25:09.365
Is it the fact that I have a
person in my life that's not you

25:09.420 --> 25:13.936
or Mom, or is it the fact
that I'm in love?

25:13.990 --> 25:17.244
Really? Sila, you just met this
guy. What are you gonna do,

25:17.290 --> 25:19.508
get a house
together and have kids?
- Gimme one good reason why not.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.721
- Because,
as everybody knows,

25:21.780 --> 25:24.169
you need to flush at least two
long-term relationships
down the toilet

25:24.210 --> 25:25.939
before you can even think
about settling down!

25:28.520 --> 25:31.648
- He asked me
to marry him, Kurtis.

25:31.700 --> 25:34.134
- That's insanity.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.398
What are you, 18 years old
in thel\19505?
- o.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.705
No, I'm a modern,
career-driven woman

25:39.750 --> 25:42.878
who's capable of working and
being loved at the same time.
- Yeah, that's great.

25:42.930 --> 25:45.398
- What I should've done

25:45.450 --> 25:47.406
in the first place: calling
Forensics to get down here

25:47.450 --> 25:49.054
and scour the crime scene,
alright?

25:49.110 --> 25:50.805
Modern woman.
Hey, Marty.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.546
Yeah.

25:53.590 --> 25:56.104
- Si_|a... _
- Screwmg up in
all the ways, aren't I?

26:00.210 --> 26:02.724
- Oh, hey, honey.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.113
How's Mickey doing?
- I think it's a Minnie,

26:05.170 --> 26:07.559
and I think she's anxious
to get out, so me and Liam

26:07.600 --> 26:09.602
are gonna release her
in a field after school.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.902
- Oh, so you haven't...

26:11.960 --> 26:14.178
No. It's harder

26:14.220 --> 26:15.915
than I thought it was gonna be.
- That's understandable, honey.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.521
Liam's a great guy and he's
become one of your best friends.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.526
If you're having
second thoughts,

26:21.580 --> 26:23.878
that's OK. Long-distance
relationships

26:23.930 --> 26:27.536
can be rewarding too.
- Yesterday you said you thought
my decision was very mature.

26:27.580 --> 26:31.368
- And it is. Ijust wanna
make sure that you're...

26:31.410 --> 26:33.583
following your heart
and not being pragmatic

26:33.630 --> 26:36.360
for the sake of it.
- Oh my God, I actually thought
I was making the right decision.

26:36.420 --> 26:38.888
- Sweetheart--
- No, Dad, I cannot talk
about this any more.

26:38.940 --> 26:40.714
- Honey, honey,

26:40.770 --> 26:44.024
wait. Look, forget
what I said, OK?

26:44.080 --> 26:48.039
This is your decision, not mine.
I shouldn't be offering advice.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.640
- But I thought you said--
- You're gonna make
the right choice, OK?

26:50.690 --> 26:53.250
Just trust yourself.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.120
Because I do.

26:55.170 --> 26:58.298
- Thanks, Dad.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.955
See ya.
- Have a good day at school.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.910
- Thank you.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.405
- Zoe...

27:16.980 --> 27:19.198
- I'm sorry.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.105
I tried to keep my mouth shut.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.105
I even tried running
away from him.
- Don't worry.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.799
We never should've put you
in that position.

27:25.860 --> 27:29.330
- Water up a duck's back, kiddo.

27:29.380 --> 27:32.167
- OK, that's great, because
I did some more digging.

27:32.210 --> 27:35.259
I figured if it wasn't
creepy Ketura,

27:35.300 --> 27:38.087
then who? May I present...

27:38.130 --> 27:40.086
Exhibit A:

27:40.130 --> 27:42.257
Dave O'Brien.

27:42.310 --> 27:44.528
A former security guard
at the aquarium.

27:44.570 --> 27:47.915
He was unceremoniously let go of
last week, after working there
for nearly a decade.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.699
- Interesting.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.877
He would've known
all about Leroy.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.875
- And maybe how to disable
the security cameras.

27:59.760 --> 28:03.366
After ten years, maybe
you wanted a little revenge.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.809
- Nah, you guys
got it all wrong.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.149
The aquarium had every right
to fire me. I was a mess

28:09.200 --> 28:12.203
the last year I worked there.

28:12.250 --> 28:15.333
- No. Made me stand up

28:15.380 --> 28:18.201
and pay attention. I even went
back to school because of it.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.956
- I was right here.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.640
I traded for an evening shift,
to audit a class.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.827
You can check with my boss,
his office is right in there.

28:26.870 --> 28:29.919
- That's OK.
We believe you.

28:29.960 --> 28:33.521
- Hey! How'd the thieves
get away with it, anyway?

28:33.580 --> 28:36.048
I mean, I worked there forever
and we never had a robbery.

28:36.100 --> 28:38.318
Not one.
- They pulled a van up

28:38.360 --> 28:41.978
to the loading bay,
hacked the security system,
broke in, stole a tank.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.887
- We couldn't make them out.

28:44.940 --> 28:48.364
- What about the parking
attendant's camera?

28:48.420 --> 28:50.718
Parking lot's maintained
by a different company.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.807
The attendant got robbed last
year, so he stuck a spy cam

28:53.860 --> 28:56.420
on top of his booth.
Points right

28:56.470 --> 28:58.631
at the aquarium back door.
- Thanks.

28:58.690 --> 29:01.773
- I called and got
the footage, no problem.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.254
I hate this parking lot
company, by the way.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.382
Nine bucks an hour downtown?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.396
I managed to zoom in this much,

29:10.440 --> 29:12.476
but...

29:12.530 --> 29:15.169
- Still can't make out anything.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.391
- And 20 minutes later...

29:17.450 --> 29:19.395
The thieves get back in the van

29:19.450 --> 29:22.669
and it speeds away.
- Nope.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.666
- Nada.
- Shoot.

29:24.710 --> 29:27.793
Oh...

29:27.850 --> 29:30.068
Hey, Maz.

29:30.110 --> 29:33.193
Analysis came back from the lab.
Fingerprints from the back area

29:33.240 --> 29:35.936
all match employees of the
facility, except for one.

29:35.990 --> 29:38.379
]
- Jordan.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.128
Sila's new boyfriend.
Or should I say fianc?

29:52.570 --> 29:55.562
Take a seat.
- I never thought this would be
how we finally meet.

29:55.610 --> 29:58.966
- Hm.

29:59.010 --> 30:01.877
Do you know anything
about the octopus that
was taken two nights ago?

30:01.930 --> 30:05.149
- Nope. I don't know anything
about marine life.

30:05.190 --> 30:07.499
That's really Sila's world.
- Yeah, it is Sila's world.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.667
In fact, it was her entire world
until you showed up.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.847
- We found your fingerprints

30:11.890 --> 30:14.199
on a tank in the restricted
area of the aquarium.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.674
Seems you're in the system
because you're a schoolteacher.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.325
What happened?
Jealous of Sila's

30:19.380 --> 30:21.894
workaholic lifestyle so you
decided to sabotage her career?

30:21.950 --> 30:24.510
- No, no! That couldn't be
further from the truth.

30:24.560 --> 30:26.903
- Then what were you doing
at the aquarium?

30:29.040 --> 30:31.429
- She...

30:31.480 --> 30:33.380
she wouldn't return
my phone calls,

30:33.440 --> 30:36.819
or texts, or emails.

30:36.870 --> 30:39.828
I did the Say Anythingmove
with the boombox,

30:39.880 --> 30:41.962
didn't work either.
- I don't understand.

30:42.010 --> 30:44.478
You two broke up? I thought
you were engaged.
- No, man.

30:44.530 --> 30:46.839
She said no. And moved out
last weekend.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.838
She just did a 180 on me.
- Huh.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.051
Aanays,

30:52.110 --> 30:54.886
I slipped past the security guy.
I just wanted to find her

30:54.940 --> 30:57.067
and talk to her.
- That's a little stalkerish.

30:57.110 --> 30:59.840
Please continue.
- She wasn't there,

30:59.900 --> 31:02.892
so I just left a note
on a Post-It.

31:02.940 --> 31:05.818
- A note on a Post-It,
how romantic!

31:05.860 --> 31:09.296
And the octopus was still in the
tank when you were there?
- Yeah,

31:09.340 --> 31:12.639
stuck on the wall.
- Eight, I think.

31:12.690 --> 31:15.773
- Well, I coach

31:15.830 --> 31:17.775
senior boys' basketball
at my school,

31:17.830 --> 31:19.786
so on Tuesdays
we practice 9 to 11.

31:19.830 --> 31:23.084
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Well,

31:23.140 --> 31:25.096
that's only 10 minutes
from Ripley's.

31:25.140 --> 31:27.040
The theft happened at 8:40,
you could totally have
still done it.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.704
- No, no, I was in traffic.

31:28.750 --> 31:30.741
On a weeknight?

31:33.190 --> 31:35.624
Alright, why don't you
sit tight and we'll, uh,

31:35.670 --> 31:38.275
check out your alibi?

31:45.860 --> 31:48.021
He seemed pretty genuine.
- Is it such a stretch

31:48.080 --> 31:50.025
to assume he wanted
some measure of revenge

31:50.080 --> 31:52.036
when Sila rejected
his proposal?

31:52.080 --> 31:55.334
- Hey. I came as soon as I got
your text. What--
- Hey.

31:55.390 --> 31:58.609
You found Jordan's
fingerprints at the aquarium?

31:58.650 --> 32:01.608
- Hang on, Sila, you're
not supposed to--
- Sila, it wasn't me.

32:01.650 --> 32:04.949
- To see you!

32:05.010 --> 32:07.877
Sila, I didn't know what else
to do. I... I left a note,

32:07.920 --> 32:10.263
did you get it?

32:10.310 --> 32:12.528
- No, I didn't.
- Sila, talk to me.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.229
You can't just shut people out
like this all of a sudden.

32:18.890 --> 32:22.064
I was happy.

32:22.110 --> 32:23.975
And then you asked me to marry
you, and the only thing

32:24.020 --> 32:27.069
that popped into my head was
how upset my family would be.

32:27.110 --> 32:29.328
I couldn't be engaged,

32:31.770 --> 32:34.466
and I know it's old-fashioned
and it's dumb--
- It's fine.

32:34.510 --> 32:37.240
I'm sorry. Just...
forget I asked.

32:38.780 --> 32:41.681
Look, my career
is on the line.

32:41.740 --> 32:45.562
Can you just give me some space?

32:47.960 --> 32:49.951
- I'll give you... I'll call you
later, we can talk...

32:50.010 --> 32:52.524
we'll talk later.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.788
Hey, you're free to go.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.831
- Hey, just remember,

32:56.880 --> 32:58.791
I gassed up after
I left Ripley's.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.185
8:45, you can check
my credit card. But thanks

33:02.240 --> 33:04.925
for making me look
like a criminal in front
of the love of my life.

33:15.340 --> 33:18.594
- We should get going.
- I'll meet you in the car.

33:18.640 --> 33:21.461
I have to say something.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.647
But it's because
I love you and Sila.

33:23.690 --> 33:25.772
- Angie, just stay out of it,
alright? Focus on the octopus.

33:25.820 --> 33:27.902
- That poor girl lost her father
when she was 13 years old,

33:27.960 --> 33:29.916
but that was OK
because she had you.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.825
She didn't need
her dad there

33:31.870 --> 33:34.134
when she graduated, when
she got her driver's license

33:34.180 --> 33:36.262
or broke her collarbone,
because she had you.

33:36.310 --> 33:38.744
- My point is she grew up, Maz.

33:38.790 --> 33:40.929
You can't keep treating her
like she's 13 years old.

33:40.970 --> 33:43.313
You did the right thing
back then,

33:43.360 --> 33:45.408
but now you gotta let her
live her life.

33:45.450 --> 33:48.453
Just be her brother,
not her father.

34:01.820 --> 34:04.857
- I think so.
- I found the perfect spot.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.993
Plenty to eat and
lots of places to hide.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.088
- You really think
she'll survive out there?

34:10.130 --> 34:13.088
- She'll be fine.

34:13.130 --> 34:15.473
She'll meet new friends
in no time.

34:15.530 --> 34:19.136
Um, you must be pretty
stoked about Italy.

34:19.180 --> 34:22.092
- Yeah, totally.

34:22.140 --> 34:24.267
_ probably gonna be busy,

34:24.320 --> 34:26.185
with the schoolwork

34:26.230 --> 34:28.698
and crazy trips
every weekend.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.661
And you'll be
across the ocean.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.756
- Which is why...

34:33.810 --> 34:36.108
Liam...
- I... I think...

34:36.160 --> 34:38.378
I think we should
just tran5ition

34:38.420 --> 34:40.320
into being friends
before you leave.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.465
- Jules, I could...
I could sense something

34:47.520 --> 34:50.159
has been off
with us for weeks.

34:50.210 --> 34:52.952
I get it.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.309
Can't say
I disagree.

34:55.350 --> 34:57.432
- OK.

35:01.790 --> 35:05.135
- Come on, let's go let
our little friend free.

35:05.190 --> 35:08.136
- Actually, uh,

35:08.190 --> 35:11.409
I'd like to hold on
to her a little longer.

35:11.450 --> 35:14.180
- OK.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.322
See you at school?

35:21.550 --> 35:23.939
- So, wasn't Jordan.
- Poor kid.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.724
- Why am I the only one
to ever change this?
- I got it.

35:28.770 --> 35:32.388
I got it.

35:42.350 --> 35:45.399
- Zoe,

35:45.440 --> 35:47.488
cue up the parking lot
security footage

35:47.530 --> 35:49.259
of the van pulling away
from the aquarium.

35:49.320 --> 35:52.187
- There.

35:52.230 --> 35:54.960
The van leaving.
- OK, stop.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.488
Now_let _me see it
pulling in again.

36:00.410 --> 36:03.197
- There.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.379
300-gallon tank full of water,

36:05.420 --> 36:08.059
that's nearly 2,500 pounds.
- The van never gets

36:08.120 --> 36:10.463
any lower. The wheel wells
would've been closer
to the tires.

36:10.510 --> 36:13.900
- The tank they took was empty.

36:13.950 --> 36:17.818
Leroy never left the facility.
- Which means_someone over there
is lying to us.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.214
- Henry,

36:25.270 --> 36:27.909
have any animals left
the facility since
the theft of Leroy?

36:27.960 --> 36:30.428
- Just Tallulah,

36:30.490 --> 36:33.129
our sea turtle. She's
being transferred to--

36:33.190 --> 36:35.351
- Puttner Aquarium, yeah,
I remember Sila told us.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.095
- When'd Tallulah's
shipment leave?

36:38.150 --> 36:40.277
- Uh, this afternoon. The truck
picked up the crate at 3PM,

36:40.320 --> 36:44.017
headed to the airport.
- Six barrels of seawater.

36:44.070 --> 36:46.459
We send enough of the habitat
with the animal

36:46.500 --> 36:48.229
to reduce the shock
at the other end.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.804
That's weird.

36:50.860 --> 36:53.420
This says 7 barrels were loaded,
but we're only sending 6.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.385
- Thanks.

37:01.610 --> 37:05.250
- OK, thanks.
The shipping company
says the driver was asked

37:05.310 --> 37:08.211
to make a last-minute stop
en route to Pearson.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.785
7273 Orbitor Road.

37:13.310 --> 37:15.835
- Etherea Industries.
What's that?

37:15.880 --> 37:18.223
- According to their website,
one of the largest manufacturers

37:18.270 --> 37:20.704
of skincare products in Canada.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.103
Their biggest selling product
is sequoia serum.

37:23.150 --> 37:26.665
In addition to their retail
operations, they have
an extensive

37:26.720 --> 37:29.712
research and development
division. "We scour the earth

37:29.760 --> 37:31.842
"in search of the most
natural sources of...

37:31.900 --> 37:34.243
cell regeneration."

37:34.290 --> 37:37.020
- Like a nearly-extinct octopus.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.298
- Whoa.

37:39.340 --> 37:41.035
- You're not gonna believe
who sits on the Etherea Board

37:41.080 --> 37:43.071
of Directors.

37:49.130 --> 37:52.258
- Hold up, boys.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.266
- We need you
to open that barrel.

37:54.310 --> 37:56.653
- I don't take orders from you.
- I told you I'd get it here.

37:56.700 --> 37:59.965
We have to get the truck back
on the road ASAP.
- Mr. Gusev.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.092
Fancy meeting you here.

38:04.410 --> 38:07.049
Did you find Leroy?

38:07.110 --> 38:08.839
- I think you
found him for us.

38:08.890 --> 38:11.324
- Turns out the theft
at the aquarium

38:11.370 --> 38:14.589
was a bit of a red herring.
- A ruse to distract
from the real crime:

38:14.640 --> 38:17.416
sneaking Leroy out
with Tallulah's shipment.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.849
- It was a clever plan,
actually, hiring thieves

38:19.900 --> 38:21.856
to steal an empty tank

38:21.900 --> 38:24.687
after you had already
removed Leroy.
- The only problem

38:24.730 --> 38:28.427
was you drained the water to
make it easier to move the tank.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.607
- There's no way that van's
carrying 2,500 pounds of water.

38:30.650 --> 38:33.562
- This is preposterous.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.306
- As preposterous as finding you
here at a cosmetics company

38:36.350 --> 38:38.045
with a truck full of_ barrels
from the aquarium?

38:39.960 --> 38:42.133
Leroy.

38:51.540 --> 38:53.451
- Do you have any idea how...

38:53.500 --> 38:55.456
how valuable a_ creature
like this is?

38:55.500 --> 38:58.367
- You wanted Leroy dead
so you could extract

38:58.420 --> 39:00.069
and replicate the nuclear
membrane thing.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.509
- Imagine...

39:02.550 --> 39:05.246
a product that doesn't
just remove wrinkles, it...

39:05.290 --> 39:09.112
actually regenerates new skin.

39:09.170 --> 39:11.946
- So exploiting people's vanity
is worth killing off
an entire species?

39:12.000 --> 39:14.514
- It would take 20 years
to repopulate the species.

39:14.560 --> 39:17.734
A discovery like this
is worth billions.

39:17.790 --> 39:21.339
- Too bad you won't be
around tlo collect.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.391
Oh, thank God!

39:23.440 --> 39:26.000
- Fred Gusev, you're
under arrest for burglary

39:26.050 --> 39:29.440
in the third degree. Get him.

39:29.490 --> 39:32.880
- I can't believe this!

39:33.890 --> 39:36.529
- Let's go.

39:54.340 --> 39:58.128
Sila just called, and Leroy
is back in his habitat,
safe and sound.

39:58.170 --> 40:00.252
- That's good news.

40:02.220 --> 40:04.347
- I'm... about to find out.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.652
Call you tomorrow.

40:06.700 --> 40:10.136
Hey, honey.

40:10.190 --> 40:13.000
Did you talk to--
- We ended it.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.574
Or I guess he did.

40:17.500 --> 40:21.106
- I know it's for the best,

40:21.150 --> 40:24.620
and it's what I wanted,

40:24.680 --> 40:26.932
but I really didn't think
it was gonna hurt this much.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.936
Like, a lot.

40:28.990 --> 40:31.072
- Aw...

40:31.120 --> 40:32.849
- No, don't hug me,
I don't wanna cry.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.073
- Honey, you just have

40:35.120 --> 40:38.032
to let yourself hurt, OK?

40:38.080 --> 40:40.958
Just... let it out,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.083
and one day
it won't hurt anymore.

40:44.130 --> 40:46.086
- That sounds horrible.

40:46.130 --> 40:48.086
- Yeah. It is.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.794
- Thank you all so much
for coming.

41:00.840 --> 41:02.888
This is a historic
moment at Ripley's.

41:02.930 --> 41:06.058
And with a little help
from our friends from...
: Down under...

41:08.720 --> 41:10.893
I can't do accents. I don't
know why I attempted that.

41:10.940 --> 41:13.192
Um... I am honored

41:13.250 --> 41:15.946
and privileged
to present to you

41:15.990 --> 41:18.117
Toronto's newest
"it" couple,

41:18.170 --> 41:21.207
Leroy and his
partner Sally.

41:29.870 --> 41:32.612
With this conjoining,

41:32.660 --> 41:35.094
we are hoping to bring
an exciting species

41:35.140 --> 41:37.574
back into existence.

41:37.620 --> 41:40.350
And to prove to all you
cynics out there that love

41:40.410 --> 41:42.571
does indeed conquer all.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.015
- That was amazing.
You were amazing.

41:50.070 --> 41:52.971
- Well, it was all thanks
to you guys. Seriously,
you two saved me.

41:53.030 --> 41:55.112
- Hey, it's
what we do. Oh,

41:55.160 --> 41:58.209
this is Zoe, our assistant.

41:58.250 --> 42:01.037
As in Maz's girlfriend?
I've been dying to meet you.

42:01.080 --> 42:04.993
- Me too. Intimidated beyond
belief, but dying.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.769
- We should all
hang out sometime.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.823
Uh, where's Kurtis?

42:09.870 --> 42:12.259
- Haven't seen him.

42:12.310 --> 42:15.177
- Oh.
- I didn't want
to cramp your style,

42:15.220 --> 42:17.302
so I watched from the back.
- You made it.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.225
- Fantastic. Of course
I made it, come on!

42:19.270 --> 42:21.318
I wouldn't
miss this.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.965
I also brought a plus-one,
I hope that's OK.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.663
- I'm not trying to interfere,

42:28.720 --> 42:30.847
I was just hoping to maybe
undo some of the damage

42:30.890 --> 42:33.620
I may have done.
- Hm. Well, thank you.

42:35.200 --> 42:39.591
Go, go, go.

42:42.990 --> 42:45.550
I got your note.
- Oh, OK.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.648
- Well,

42:47.690 --> 42:50.341
it's an octopus

42:50.390 --> 42:52.858
with a boombox.
I'm not good at drawing.
- Oh. Of course it is.

42:58.220 --> 43:01.610
- Good job, big brother.
- Eh.

43:01.660 --> 43:05.448
You were right.
- Come on,

43:05.490 --> 43:08.186
let's get a closer
look at these octopuses.
- My God, is that a euphemism

43:08.230 --> 43:10.186
for something, or do you really
wanna look at octopuses?

43:10.230 --> 43:12.186
- Guess you'll have
to wait and see.
- Oh, my God!

43:12.240 --> 43:14.140
We're gonna get
kicked out of here!

43:14.200 --> 43:16.885
- Did you know octopuses
have three hearts,

43:16.940 --> 43:19.238
Everett?
- No.

43:19.290 --> 43:21.417
Poor them. Three times
the heartbreak.

43:21.460 --> 43:24.156
- Or three times
the capaCIty for love.

43:30.170 --> 43:32.126
: Ho, ho, ho, ho! Yeah!
