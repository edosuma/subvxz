HANK: (ON RADIO)
<i>The proton cube</i>

00:02.333 --> 00:03.749
<i>is an experimental</i>
<i>energy source of mine.</i>

00:03.749 --> 00:05.707
<i>Generally, it's harmless.</i>
<i>But in the wrong hands,</i>

00:05.707 --> 00:07.333
<i>it could cause the world</i>
<i>to collapse into itself.</i>

00:07.333 --> 00:08.957
Get the complicated
science box you lost

00:08.957 --> 00:10.707
so the bad guys won't use it.
Got you, Hank.

00:10.707 --> 00:11.957
HANK: (ON RADIO)
<i>I didn't lose it.</i>

00:11.957 --> 00:14.790
<i>I just didn't know</i>
<i>where it was for a long time.</i>

00:14.790 --> 00:17.374
<i>Be careful, the cube affects</i>
<i>time and space around it.</i>

00:17.374 --> 00:19.790
<i>The closer you get to it,</i>
<i>the more you'll be affected</i>
<i>as well.</i>

00:19.790 --> 00:21.041
ANT-MAN: Oh, so...
Ant-Man!

00:21.041 --> 00:23.333
I'm taking this cube on behalf
of the Masters of Evil!

00:23.333 --> 00:25.041
Not so fast, Yellowjacket!

00:25.041 --> 00:28.582
We'll rule the world
with this energy source!

00:28.582 --> 00:29.499
What are you doing?
Fight!

00:32.000 --> 00:33.957
(GRUNTING)

00:33.957 --> 00:37.083
Ha-ha! Oh, yeah.
That's one for Ant-Man.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.208
You're going down!

00:38.707 --> 00:39.749
(RUMBLING)

00:41.416 --> 00:43.124
(BOTH GRUNTING)

00:43.124 --> 00:44.374
(ECHOING)
Stop!

00:44.374 --> 00:48.874
(GRUNTS)
No! Get over here!

00:48.874 --> 00:50.915
ANT-MAN: I said stop!
Don't touch me.

00:50.915 --> 00:52.208
YELLOWJACKET:
I'll touch you if I want.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.291
(YELLOWJACKET LAUGHING)

00:59.291 --> 01:00.707
The cube is mine!

01:00.707 --> 01:02.707
I bet you don't even know
what it does.

01:02.707 --> 01:03.832
Do you?
Shut up!

01:07.624 --> 01:08.624
(GRUNTING)

01:10.208 --> 01:11.416
Woo-hoo!

01:11.416 --> 01:12.666
Hey, you.

01:12.666 --> 01:14.666
What did you do?

01:14.666 --> 01:15.790
Found something.

01:15.790 --> 01:18.624
Okay.
Hey, my science box cube.

01:18.624 --> 01:20.457
Good job, Scott.
Yeah, right. I think.

01:20.457 --> 01:22.083
So, how about them burritos?

01:22.083 --> 01:23.874
Oh, come on. Again?

01:23.874 --> 01:25.790
I only need two more
on my punch card
and then I get a free one.
