00:56.633 --> 00:58.333
- Kardash...
- I never heard it that

00:58.333 --> 00:59.833

your own twist on things.

in the business and to be
rightful-minded while you're

01:30.067 --> 01:32.067

We don't have to argue and fight

01:32.067 --> 01:34.067
and we don't have to agree to
everything that we do or don't

01:34.067 --> 01:35.733
like, but we can always be
family.

No, he didn't.
Is he old enough?

He won't tell me his
age.

I'm not gonna tell
you, either.

I just, you know, Kanye said I

03:09.067 --> 03:12.933
Lately, I've been thinking I
would love to maybe have another

03:12.933 --> 03:16.867
baby, but, like, I had two
really difficult pregnancies and

03:16.867 --> 03:19.667
really difficult deliveries.

03:19.667 --> 03:23.533
- It hurts so bad.
- Don't cry.

03:23.533 --> 03:25.367
- It's gonna be okay.
- It just hurts so badly,

03:25.367 --> 03:28.033
I, like, could never do this
again.

03:28.033 --> 03:33.000
So getting pregnant again, it's
something that does...

03:33.000 --> 03:35.400

- What if you decide

03:35.400 --> 03:37.800
not to have them? You'd rather--
Well, after three years,

03:37.800 --> 03:40.033
at 40, I'm not gonna pay to keep
them in this freezer.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.033
- Can I pay?
- I'm gonna have to ask

03:42.033 --> 03:43.700

- He already said yes!

03:43.700 --> 03:45.167
I asked him at the birthday
party!

03:45.167 --> 03:46.533

you were joking.

03:46.533 --> 03:48.133
You can't ask him in a party
environment with some drinks...

03:48.133 --> 03:49.600
- He wasn't drinking...
- It has to be, like,

03:49.600 --> 03:51.267
- with attorneys and a sit-down.
- No.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.267
It has to be, like, a
full sit-down.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.400
If you had an attorney
involved, they're gonna change

09:40.233 --> 09:47.067
that type of stuff, you're
gonna get a lot of hate.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.533
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. Oh, we're so...

09:58.533 --> 10:01.700
- Oh, my goodness!
- Wow, we coordinated,

10:01.700 --> 10:03.800
- and we didn't even have to try.
- That's 'cause we're

10:03.800 --> 10:05.633
- sisters.
- Cute.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.467
- Aren't we?
- Yeah.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.367
How the hell are you,
"happershrand"?

10:09.367 --> 10:11.000
You know the Black
Eyed Peas song, "Where is the

10:11.000 --> 10:12.667
- Love"?
Mm-hmm.

10:12.667 --> 10:16.300
will.i.am remixed
it and did a whole video to it.

10:16.300 --> 10:18.367
- For what?
- So I did it for

10:18.367 --> 10:19.933
everything that's happening,
Black Lives Matter, all of that

10:19.933 --> 10:21.767
- stuff.
- It's so sad.

10:21.767 --> 10:23.367
It's one thing after another
after another.

10:23.367 --> 10:24.767
I know.
It makes me feel like the world

10:24.767 --> 10:26.433
- is ending.
- I don't know if we

10:26.433 --> 10:28.600
have more access to viewing
everything, like, we're just

10:28.600 --> 10:31.467
- more aware of stuff.
- Yeah, but we've had

10:31.467 --> 10:33.500
access to viewing everything for
years now, and it hasn't been

10:33.500 --> 10:35.333
- this bad.
- Yeah, but the older

10:35.333 --> 10:36.967
you get the more aware you
become of things.

10:36.967 --> 10:38.733
- True.
- And like social media

10:38.733 --> 10:40.667
- wasn't as big a few years ago.
- We should do

10:40.667 --> 10:43.133
- something.
- With our platforms,

10:43.133 --> 10:45.967
how many people we have access
to, it's probably really silly

10:45.967 --> 10:48.500
to not.
But, like, what are you most

10:48.500 --> 10:50.400
passionate about?
Is it, like, the gun laws?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.400
Yeah, I mean I feel
like that's kind of step one,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.467
- no?
- I think gun laws

10:54.467 --> 10:56.767
forever have needed to be
changed.

10:56.767 --> 10:59.133
Movie theater killings, all that
stuff is all things that were

10:59.133 --> 11:02.233
- preventable, like...
- Yeah, totally.

11:02.233 --> 11:04.867
I'm very passionate about
stricter gun laws.

11:04.867 --> 11:07.867
I've never really made a
statement, but having such a big

11:07.867 --> 11:11.667
platform, I feel obligated to
take action now, especially with

11:11.667 --> 11:14.700
everything that's going on.
It's such a hard thing to try

11:14.700 --> 11:18.200
and like change one human being.
You can't go and like, be like,

11:18.200 --> 11:21.467
"I'm gonna change your soul."
Like, you know what I mean?

11:21.467 --> 11:24.933
It's harder to get a
car than it is to buy a gun,

11:24.933 --> 11:27.533
- which is wild.
- That's so wild.

11:27.533 --> 11:29.833
But I think, like, it
starts with one person.

11:29.833 --> 11:32.700
One person has to make a change
somewhere, and if you could

11:32.700 --> 11:36.533
bring awareness to just one
other person, like, that follows

11:36.533 --> 11:39.433
you, or believes in you, or
likes you, I think that's all

11:39.433 --> 11:41.433
- you could ask for.
- Yeah.

11:41.433 --> 11:44.267
But I think if we all
as a family, did one cause and

11:44.267 --> 11:47.833
really brought awareness to it,
I think it will move mountains.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.900
Kim loves that.
Like, Kim's always been really

11:49.900 --> 11:52.333
passionate about it, so I think
our next step is maybe having

11:52.333 --> 11:55.500
- like a little family powwow.
- Yeah.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.467
Are you supposed to have one
braid popping out?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.400
I have, like, a few
braids.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.267
Oh, I thought it was
like part of your, like,

12:01.267 --> 12:03.500
extensions, or something, that
was just, like, coming out.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.300
- Like my weave?
- Yeah.

12:05.300 --> 12:12.700
No.♪ ♪

- Good to see you.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.767
- You, too.
- All right.

12:25.767 --> 12:27.867

- Oh, my gosh,

- congratulations.
- He weighs almost as much

12:31.933 --> 12:33.733
- as my daughter; he's huge.
- Adorable.

12:33.733 --> 12:35.733
- Happy kid.
- He's so cute that I feel

12:35.733 --> 12:37.533
like, oh, my God, I need to have
another one.

12:37.533 --> 12:39.167
Okay, so this is why
you're here today?

12:39.167 --> 12:41.867
Yeah.
So I didn't get good news from

12:41.867 --> 12:44.933
Dr. Crane, and, you know, it's
super disappointing.

12:44.933 --> 12:50.300
I really want to have another
baby, and Dr. Huang is the best

12:50.300 --> 12:53.967
fertility specialist.
So I just want to get a second

12:53.967 --> 12:56.433
opinion and see what he has to
say.

12:56.433 --> 12:59.100
In my evaluation of
your pregnancies, there's the

12:59.100 --> 13:01.667
risk of postpartum hemorrhage,
right?

13:01.667 --> 13:03.833
So you know, we don't want to
carry that same risk of having

13:03.833 --> 13:06.733
you get pregnant, deliver the
babies, and then need blood

13:06.733 --> 13:10.033
transfusion or, God forbid, if
we can't stop the bleeding, uh,

13:10.033 --> 13:12.767
do a hysterectomy.
Your first pregnancy, you had

13:12.767 --> 13:15.300
placenta accreta and
preeclampsia.

13:15.300 --> 13:17.467
When you have one pregnancy
with preeclampsia, it does

13:17.467 --> 13:20.133
increase your risk about 25% to
30% of having a subsequent

13:20.133 --> 13:22.467
pregnancy with preeclampsia.
You getting pregnant again would

13:22.467 --> 13:25.033
be a high-risk pregnancy.
The other option then, would be

13:25.033 --> 13:27.600
to consider using a gestational
surrogate.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.233
You know, if you were trying to
safeguard you, and being around

13:31.233 --> 13:35.067
for these, you know, kids that
you have, then doing what's safe

13:35.067 --> 13:38.133
is the best thing.
Using a surrogate is not an

13:38.133 --> 13:42.100
- unreasonable option.
- If the two doctors that

13:42.100 --> 13:45.933
I trust have told me that it
would not be safe for me to get

13:45.933 --> 13:49.800
pregnant again, I have to listen
to that, but because I don't

13:49.800 --> 13:53.133
know anyone that's been a
surrogate, anyone that's used a

13:53.133 --> 13:57.100
surrogate, I didn't really think
of that as an option for me.

13:57.100 --> 13:59.167
I don't know.
I need-- I just want to like,

13:59.167 --> 14:01.567
- weigh my options.
- The question is, how

14:01.567 --> 14:04.033
can we do this safely, because
if our goal is to grow your

14:04.033 --> 14:08.800
family like you want to, then a
surrogate makes sense.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.233
Well, what are you
leaning towards?

14:20.233 --> 14:22.533
Like, do you think you would be
pregnant again or have a

14:22.533 --> 14:25.500
- surrogate?
- Obviously, I do want to

14:25.500 --> 14:28.167
- have my own baby.
- Yeah.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.133
You know?
But I feel like I truly don't

14:31.133 --> 14:36.200
know if my body can handle it
one more time.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.767
You should talk to
somebody maybe who's used a

14:38.767 --> 14:41.667
- surrogate.
- Yeah.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.100
Just think of a
surrogate the whole way through.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.567
Somebody, like, would you, like
I would be...

14:48.567 --> 14:50.567
Yeah, like what
are you eating?"

14:50.567 --> 14:52.233
- Right.
- What are you this?

14:52.233 --> 14:56.333
What are you that?
I mean, there's just a lot of

14:56.333 --> 14:58.767
of fears that I have about
surrogacy and a lot of, like,

14:58.767 --> 15:01.333
unanswered questions.
Like, I just don't have the

15:01.333 --> 15:03.533
information on it.
I don't know how I'm gonna feel

15:03.533 --> 15:05.867
about it.
I never have given it that much

15:05.867 --> 15:13.533
thought, that I just, it's
something that does concern me.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.500
If you use a
surrogate, nobody has to know

15:16.500 --> 15:18.833
the whole time.
You could have a baby for a

15:18.833 --> 15:20.700
year, and nobody would even
know.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.700
Not that that's a reason to

15:22.700 --> 15:25.333
have a surrogate, but if you
have to, that is a benefit.

little stroller?

other, because we all grew up

19:18.233 --> 19:19.700
It doesn't matter, it
doesn't matter.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.233
- What?
- No, well, it was.

19:21.233 --> 19:22.667
It was just I put it in her
storage. It's all good.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.233
- It's brand, it's brand new.
- Oh. She just gave

19:24.233 --> 19:25.900
it to me.
And then this is my favorite

19:25.900 --> 19:27.900
- part.
- This is a dope-ass room.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.933
I call it the boys'
room.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.400
Yeah, this is where
probably I would be all the

19:32.400 --> 19:35.900
time.
What's this?

19:35.900 --> 19:38.267
"Chrissy Teigen leaves Twitter
after gun..."

19:38.267 --> 19:40.267
"...control tweet."
Um, Khloe and I were talking.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.733
I've been looking for, like, gun
control organizations to get

19:42.733 --> 19:45.367
involved with.
'Cause I'm, like... we have such

19:45.367 --> 19:48.733
a nice platform to, like, bring
awareness to things.

19:48.733 --> 19:51.667
Yeah. Gun control's,
like, a very serious thing in

19:51.667 --> 19:55.067
America, in the world.
But if you get involved with

19:55.067 --> 19:57.433
that type of stuff, you're
definitely gonna, like, get some

19:57.433 --> 20:00.100
backlash.
Be a lot of people that have

20:00.100 --> 20:02.833
completely different views that
are opposite than you.

20:02.833 --> 20:06.733
So you're gonna get a lot of
hate.

20:06.733 --> 20:09.533
Kim received a lot of backlash
when she spoke on it.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.933
- Really?
- Yeah, you're a young,

20:11.933 --> 20:15.733
powerful woman, so you got to...
just be prepared for the

20:15.733 --> 20:19.567
- negativity as well.
- That's crazy.

20:19.567 --> 20:22.800
"Conservatives are saying that
Matt Damon's a hypocrite because

20:22.800 --> 20:25.100
"his character in a movie
carries firearms."

20:25.100 --> 20:27.267
- Is that a joke?
- People get crazy with

20:27.267 --> 20:29.833
anything.
If you say something that's

20:29.833 --> 20:32.000
completely right, you're still
gonna hear a bunch of.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.067
I feel like if I get
involved, it's gonna do more

20:34.067 --> 20:38.300
- damage than actually help.
- Why don't you want to do

20:38.300 --> 20:40.300
- the interview?
- Oh, here we go.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.300
'Cause you're gonna
have way different questions

20:42.300 --> 20:44.933
than I have.
I think you will regret it later

20:44.933 --> 20:48.700
- if you don't.
- Khloe was telling me

20:48.700 --> 20:51.400
that you really wanted to get
involved in something.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.433
I set up a lunch with some gun
violence victims that I think

20:55.433 --> 21:03.067
would really love to meet you
guys.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.867
Put your right hand
out like you're gonna shake my

21:12.867 --> 21:15.667
hand.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.667
That's so trippy.
Who taught you to do that?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.667
Okay, wait, then
another one.

21:19.667 --> 21:22.867
Everyone just curl in.
Keep going, keep going.

21:22.867 --> 21:24.867
This deserves a
Snapchat.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.867
- Guess the fingers.
- Oh, I think they'll

21:26.867 --> 21:28.867
- know my fingers.
- My nail is so...

21:28.867 --> 21:30.867
I think they're gonna
know my finger.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.867
Do you guys know you can
change the color of your

21:32.867 --> 21:34.867
- letters? I had no idea.
- Yeah.

21:34.867 --> 21:37.367
Duh. I don't even know
Snapchat.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.233
- Dodo bird.
- Khloe was telling me

21:40.233 --> 21:42.333
that you really wanted to get
involved in something.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.467
Mm-hmm.
- I was telling her that

21:44.467 --> 21:48.200
you do a lot of stuff for, like,
gun awareness and gun violence.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.800
- I was saying we should ask you.
- I work with this

21:50.800 --> 21:55.533
organization, Everytown, and I
set up a lunch with some gun

21:55.533 --> 21:59.433
violence victims.
Some family members that

21:59.433 --> 22:01.633
have been affected that I think
would really love to meet you

22:01.633 --> 22:04.133
guys, 'cause they really do
appreciate people like us

22:04.133 --> 22:06.600
speaking out.
I've been meeting with

22:06.600 --> 22:09.967
Everytown, an organization that
is fighting to change all the

22:09.967 --> 22:13.133
gun control laws.
There are so many loopholes in

22:13.133 --> 22:16.200
the system, and I just feel
really passionately about how

22:16.200 --> 22:18.700
our gun control laws have to
change.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.067
You guys should meet with them
and see what they're all about

22:21.067 --> 22:23.633
and see if it's something that
fits for you.

22:23.633 --> 22:29.133
- I'm down for it.
- I want to do this

22:29.133 --> 22:31.267
and I want to be a part of it,
but it just makes me nervous,

22:31.267 --> 22:33.667
like, what people are gonna
think of it.

22:33.667 --> 22:36.033
You don't know who's gonna,
like, actually be for it and

22:36.033 --> 22:38.033
- who's not.
- That's why a lot of

22:38.033 --> 22:40.700
people don't get involved, I've
learned, is because you do...

22:40.700 --> 22:43.500
- you can get a lot of backlash.
- It's kind of

22:43.500 --> 22:46.167
difficult, 'cause I know that we
are public figures.

22:46.167 --> 22:49.767
And seeing how controversial it
could be to speak out about

22:49.767 --> 22:52.100
something you're passionate
about, I just think I don't want

22:52.100 --> 22:57.067
the attention of someone not
agreeing with what I'm saying to

22:57.067 --> 23:00.633
take away from the fact that
there's actual gun issues that

23:00.633 --> 23:02.933
need to be handled.
It might bring more harm than

23:02.933 --> 23:05.900
- good.
- I feel like, in life,

23:05.900 --> 23:08.167
I've gotten a lot of backlash
and I've gotten a lot of hate,

23:08.167 --> 23:10.167
so I'm gonna just stick up for
what I believe in and what I

23:10.167 --> 23:12.167
- want.
- It's something that

23:12.167 --> 23:14.167
you believe in, so you have to
be confident in it and go for

23:14.167 --> 23:17.633
it.
But at the same time, like...

23:17.633 --> 23:27.400
I don't know.♪ ♪

23:27.400 --> 23:30.833
- This tan is everything.
- Thanks. It's actually

23:30.833 --> 23:34.000
- a real tan, for once in my life.
- It's very becoming.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.533
I haven't had a real
tan in about three years.

23:36.533 --> 23:39.300
- Yeah. Me, neither.
- Um, we are... Do you

23:39.300 --> 23:41.300
even know about this, the legacy
video that we want to shoot with

23:41.300 --> 23:43.300
- MJ?
- I don't.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.300
I love that it has a
name now.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.867
- It's a legacy video.
- Yeah. So, Mom wanted

23:48.867 --> 23:51.300
to do this video with MJ, so I
came up with a few questions

23:51.300 --> 23:53.300
- that we could ask.
- Can I see?

23:53.300 --> 23:56.800
Why don't we have
Anderson Cooper be the mediator

23:56.800 --> 24:00.033
and ask MJ all the questions?
She would die.

24:00.033 --> 24:02.300
Okay, that's so
impersonal, and MJ will give...

24:02.300 --> 24:04.300
like, she would love that her
grandkids are asking her

24:04.300 --> 24:06.300
questions.
And it's way more sentimental.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.300
- Totally.
- And she will be way

24:08.300 --> 24:10.300
more inclined to give, like,
deep, emotional answers, rather

24:10.300 --> 24:12.300
- than Anderson, who...
- Oh, here we go.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.300
She'll feel guarded,
and MJ's not, like...

24:14.300 --> 24:17.533
Anderson is hot.
Like, she loves Anderson.

24:17.533 --> 24:22.867
Why don't you want to do
the interview?

24:22.867 --> 24:25.800
It just makes me sad.
I don't want to cry through the

24:25.800 --> 24:28.700
whole thing, you know, because
it's like the story of someone's

24:28.700 --> 24:30.867
life, but at the end of their
life.

24:30.867 --> 24:36.933
I just feel like I-I don't know
what I will do when something

24:36.933 --> 24:40.233
happens to her.
I'm especially emotional when it

24:40.233 --> 24:44.000
comes to my mom, because I
realize that one day she won't

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
be here.
So I would rather not be the

24:47.000 --> 24:50.267
person interviewing my mom,
because I know that I'm going to

24:50.267 --> 24:55.300
- be an emotional wreck.
- I think you will

24:55.300 --> 25:00.100
regret it later if you don't.
If you ever watch this, you're

25:00.100 --> 25:02.433
gonna want to, like, hear your
voice or things that you really

25:02.433 --> 25:04.467
are interested about, 'cause
you're gonna have way different

25:04.467 --> 25:07.933
questions than I have.
It's okay to share emotion.

25:07.933 --> 25:09.933
- Totally.
- I share too much

25:09.933 --> 25:11.933
- emotion sometimes...
- But you don't want to

25:11.933 --> 25:13.600
- interview her at all.
- I would love to--

25:13.600 --> 25:15.700
You know what, I think is...
just because we're sitting

25:15.700 --> 25:18.367
here discussing it, now I'm
really thinking about it, I

25:18.367 --> 25:21.500
think we should share.
I think if we each took an hour,

25:21.500 --> 25:23.900
it would be a lot easier and it
would give her a change of

25:23.900 --> 25:27.033
scenery.
I understand what Khloe's

25:27.033 --> 25:29.967
saying, but I don't want to be
that emotional.

25:29.967 --> 25:34.400
I think it will be a more
meaningful tape with me doing

25:34.400 --> 25:40.667
it, as long as I can just keep
it together.

25:40.667 --> 25:43.067
If I had had a
surrogate, would I love them the

25:43.067 --> 25:45.633
- same?
- There's not a day

25:45.633 --> 25:48.233
where I have any thought that my
love for my kids are different.

25:48.233 --> 25:50.233
Just a lot to think
about.

25:50.233 --> 25:52.233
We also wanted
to thank the Kardashian family

25:52.233 --> 25:54.233
for all the work that you guys
have done.

25:54.233 --> 25:56.367
I know that this has been an
issue that you've been speaking

25:56.367 --> 25:59.533
- out on.
- Where is Kendall?

25:59.533 --> 26:01.433
I thought she was gonna be here.

26:11.767 --> 26:14.000
I'm redecorating
this room.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.433
- I'm keeping those sconces.
- Yeah.

26:16.433 --> 26:19.000
The hallway looks
so much cleaner without them.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
- Way better.
- But I also want it

26:21.000 --> 26:23.267
to look like a home.
I don't want it to look like...

26:23.267 --> 26:25.267
- A monastery?
- Yeah.

26:25.267 --> 26:28.300
So, Dr. Huang set up
someone that has used a

26:28.300 --> 26:33.267
surrogate before.
Her name's Natalie.

26:33.267 --> 26:36.633
I want to talk to someone
that's used a surrogate that

26:36.633 --> 26:39.967
also has carried a child before
so that she would know the

26:39.967 --> 26:44.067
difference.
I want to explore every avenue,

26:44.067 --> 26:47.467
just do all the research that I
possibly can to figure out what

26:47.467 --> 26:50.133
- all of my options are.
- Hi.

26:50.133 --> 26:52.333
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm Natalie.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.200
- Hi. I'm Kim.
- Nice to meet you.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.033
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Kourtney.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.700
- This is my sister.
- Hi.

26:57.700 --> 27:00.367
- Nice to meet you.
- So you had a baby

27:00.367 --> 27:02.367
- naturally.
- Yes.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.267
And then you used a
surrogate and had twins.

27:04.267 --> 27:06.167
Yeah. I was
diagnosed with breast cancer,

27:06.167 --> 27:07.967
and my oldest was six months
old, so if I wanted more kids,

27:07.967 --> 27:11.233
- this was it.
- Yeah.

27:11.233 --> 27:13.367
And so, I then had
twins via surrogate.

27:13.367 --> 27:15.200
- And were they your egg?
- Yes.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.067
And your husband's
sperm?

27:17.067 --> 27:18.800
They're my... Yeah.
They are my husband's, yeah.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.000
- They're genetically ours.
- Yeah, and do you have a

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
relationship with the surrogate
now?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.700
- We don't.
- Was that her

27:24.700 --> 27:26.500
- her first time?
- No, it was her

27:26.500 --> 27:28.767
third.
Someone has to really understand

27:28.767 --> 27:31.567
what they're taking on, and if
you've done it before, it makes

27:31.567 --> 27:34.800
- a huge difference.
- I'm more worried that,

27:34.800 --> 27:39.000
like, 'cause I gave birth to
two, there's a sense in me that

27:39.000 --> 27:41.667
feels like because I went
through all that pain for these

27:41.667 --> 27:44.800
two babies, like, I know we,
like, did this together.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.833
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.000
Like, we went through
hell and back together.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.333
This little baby was just...
Like, there's no one that

27:54.333 --> 27:57.333
would feel your love.
Like, they're literally near

27:57.333 --> 28:00.233
your heart.
Like, they're inside of you, and

28:00.233 --> 28:02.233
there's no one else that could
be as close to your heart as

28:02.233 --> 28:07.900
your babies.
My bond with my kids is so

28:07.900 --> 28:10.700
strong.
I think my biggest fear is just

28:10.700 --> 28:13.833
that, like, if I had had a
surrogate, I just don't know.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.967
Like, would I love them the
same?

28:15.967 --> 28:20.033
That's, like, the main thing
that I keep on thinking about.

28:20.033 --> 28:23.033
That scares me.

28:24.467 --> 28:29.500
There's not a day
where I have any thought that my

28:29.500 --> 28:31.733
- love for my kids are different.
- Yeah.

28:31.733 --> 28:33.767
That my connection
to my kids are different.

28:33.767 --> 28:36.000
- Oh, wow.
- You know, you get to

28:36.000 --> 28:39.033
carry one and have them close to
you, but the other is 'cause you

28:39.033 --> 28:41.033
so desperately wanted them in
your family.

28:41.033 --> 28:45.467
Yeah, but, like, I don't
want to take the easy way out.

28:45.467 --> 28:47.467
It's not taking the
easy way out.

28:47.467 --> 28:49.467
Mm-hmm.
- It's actually

28:49.467 --> 28:51.300
saying, "I want to raise my
kids."

28:51.300 --> 28:53.033
It's actually the hard way out.
It's you saying you're not gonna

28:53.033 --> 28:54.933
- do it.
- Yeah.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.767
You say you're gonna
let somebody else do that for

28:56.767 --> 28:59.633
you because you want to be with
your kids.

28:59.633 --> 29:01.733
This is really
reassuring, so she's giving me a

29:01.733 --> 29:04.667
lot of hope.
I mean, it's still a lot for me

29:04.667 --> 29:07.000
to think about, so I really want
to, like, talk it over with my

29:07.000 --> 29:11.300
husband.
I have to see just what I

29:11.300 --> 29:14.433
believe God is, like, putting in
my life and what's meant to be

29:14.433 --> 29:16.767
for me.
Thank you so much.

29:16.767 --> 29:18.600
- My pleasure.
- Thank you for sharing

29:18.600 --> 29:21.433
your story.

29:22.900 --> 29:31.400
Just a lot to think
about.

29:31.400 --> 29:35.433
- So nice out here.
- It is really pretty.

29:35.433 --> 29:38.767
Hi.
Today is the lunch with

29:38.767 --> 29:42.733
Everytown, and I'm really glad
that my mom and my other sisters

29:42.733 --> 29:44.567
- are going to join.
- Hi. Lucy McBath.

29:44.567 --> 29:46.400
- Hi. So nice to meet you.
- Mother of Jordan Davis.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
I'm Kris.
How are you?

29:48.400 --> 29:50.933
Hi. How are you?
The more we can get this message

29:50.933 --> 29:53.900
out, the better, and I just...
I want them to see something

29:53.900 --> 29:56.533
that I've been really passionate
about.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.633
So I just wanted
to thank everyone for coming

29:58.633 --> 30:01.767
together to share stories, to
talk about why this work matters

30:01.767 --> 30:03.800
so much.
We also wanted to thank the

30:03.800 --> 30:05.867
Kardashian family for coming
here.

30:05.867 --> 30:07.700
Thank you for all the work that
you guys have done.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.533
I know that this has been an
issue that you've been speaking

30:09.533 --> 30:11.533
out on.

30:11.533 --> 30:20.467
Where is Kendall?
I thought she was gonna be here.

30:20.467 --> 30:23.867
So there is this woman
that Dr. Huang had me meet with

30:23.867 --> 30:28.967
that had a baby with a
surrogate.

30:28.967 --> 30:31.067
I just want to chat for
a second about how this is gonna

30:31.067 --> 30:34.733
go.
I decide to ask my mom the

30:34.733 --> 30:41.200
questions after all, but I'm
nervous.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.733
Where is Kendall?

30:44.733 --> 30:50.000
I thought she was gonna be here.
I know Kendall had some

30:50.000 --> 30:53.533
reservations about supporting
the cause due to backlash.

30:53.533 --> 30:55.833
I would say if you're passionate
about something, get behind it

30:55.833 --> 30:59.233
- 100%.
-  the backlash.

30:59.233 --> 31:02.833
Who cares?
So I hope that she does show up.

31:02.833 --> 31:06.133
I wanted to kick
it off to Lucy to, um, welcome

31:06.133 --> 31:08.267
and share her story and, uh,
some of the work that she's

31:08.267 --> 31:09.933
doing and, um, that she's
proud of.

31:09.933 --> 31:13.633
- Sorry I'm late.
- And there's another

31:13.633 --> 31:15.633
little Jenner-- Kendall.

31:15.633 --> 31:17.700
Oh, I'm at the
head.

31:17.700 --> 31:21.833
- Yeah, you are.
- Hi.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.333
Everybody, thank you so
much for coming here.

31:24.333 --> 31:26.833
We're very honored to have you
here with us.

31:26.833 --> 31:29.733
I'm the mother of Jordan Davis.
He's the young man that was shot

31:29.733 --> 31:32.200
and killed in Jacksonville.
One that the country has deemed

31:32.200 --> 31:35.000
"the loud music case."
Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense

31:35.000 --> 31:38.333
in America were really the ones
to give me a platform to really

31:38.333 --> 31:41.733
be able to fight, not just for
Jordan, but for all Americans

31:41.733 --> 31:44.267
that are dying senselessly
around the country.

31:44.267 --> 31:47.500
Uh, my mom, Dawn, was
the principal that was killed in

31:47.500 --> 31:50.800
- the Sandy Hook school shooting.
- I lost a close

31:50.800 --> 31:54.833
friend to gun violence when, um,
I was in high school.

31:54.833 --> 31:56.833
Gun violence is just ravaging
our community.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.567
My son and their
brother was murdered last year

31:59.567 --> 32:04.133
outside our family home by a
friend from high school that he

32:04.133 --> 32:09.200
had not seen for four years.
He, um, shot him seven times and

32:09.200 --> 32:15.000
- left him to die.
My dad-- he was at a

32:15.000 --> 32:18.800
work training event in San
Bernardino last December when,

32:18.800 --> 32:22.767
um, his co-workers shot the
place, and he, along with 13

32:22.767 --> 32:25.933
other people, died.
The weekend before the shooting,

32:25.933 --> 32:29.933
we were speaking about workplace
violence, and I had no idea that

32:29.933 --> 32:31.933
four days later, my dad would be
gone.

32:31.933 --> 32:34.967
Chris was our only
child.

32:34.967 --> 32:38.567
He was everything to us, and the
only thing that's important to

32:38.567 --> 32:44.667
me now is try to prevent more
families from losing their

32:44.667 --> 32:48.767
children like ours did.
Every day that goes by without

32:48.767 --> 32:52.100
us taking our best efforts to
reduce gun violence in this

32:52.100 --> 32:55.367
country means that more people
die for no good reason.

32:55.367 --> 32:58.867
Anything we can do,
we're glad, you know, to be here

32:58.867 --> 33:04.267
- and just to spread the word.
- Hearing all these

33:04.267 --> 33:06.700
personal stories from the people
that actually had to suffer from

33:06.700 --> 33:09.467
it just makes me want to get
more involved in Everytown.

33:09.467 --> 33:11.833
I think it'd be a little
irresponsible of me to take this

33:11.833 --> 33:14.333
platform for granted, and I
think that I need to appreciate

33:14.333 --> 33:17.600
it and use it, so, I'm just
gonna kind of go for it.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.600
- So handsome.
- He was good looking.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.800
They say, "Not one
more," which is what our goal

33:24.800 --> 33:26.767
is, that not one more person has
to die...

33:26.767 --> 33:28.667
- Thank you.
- ...in this country

33:28.667 --> 33:30.667
for reasons that we can prevent.

33:33.267 --> 33:35.900
We should all take a
group picture and start getting

33:35.900 --> 33:39.367
a good message out there.
Can we all squeeze in?

33:39.367 --> 33:43.900
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.800
Is everyone okay if I
post this to social media?

33:45.800 --> 33:55.933
- Sure, yeah.
- Please do.

33:55.933 --> 33:57.967
- Okay, bye.
- Can I just tell you one

33:57.967 --> 33:59.967
- little thing?
- Hmm.

33:59.967 --> 34:01.767
It's a little
distracting talking to you with

34:01.767 --> 34:03.600
- a grill.
- I knew you were gonna

34:03.600 --> 34:05.400
- say that.
- I don't know whether

34:05.400 --> 34:07.233
to look at your grill or your
boobs.

34:07.233 --> 34:09.400
- I'm really so confused today.
- It's just the first time

34:09.400 --> 34:11.733
- I'm wearing it, so...
- Mm.

34:11.733 --> 34:14.867
So there's this woman
that Dr. Huang had me meet with

34:14.867 --> 34:16.867
that had a baby with a
surrogate.

34:16.867 --> 34:19.867
I just wanted to know what her
experience was.

34:19.867 --> 34:23.533
Like, is she...?
Does she love the baby the same?

34:23.533 --> 34:26.167
Does it feel the same?
Like, is she just as happy?

34:26.167 --> 34:28.700
You know?
I know what it's like to have a

34:28.700 --> 34:31.033
lot of siblings and having,
like, all of our fun holidays

34:31.033 --> 34:34.900
- and what a fun life that is.
- There's Kourtney and

34:34.900 --> 34:39.867
Robert and Khloe.
There we have all four of you.

34:39.867 --> 34:42.900
- How beautiful.
- I think it's, like, the

34:42.900 --> 34:46.700
best support system to have
siblings, so I would love to

34:46.700 --> 34:49.167
have one more at least.
So I've kind of come to the

34:49.167 --> 34:52.433
conclusion in my mind that,
okay, I can't carry another one,

34:52.433 --> 34:55.400
and now I just want to, like,
explore surrogacy.

34:55.400 --> 35:04.800
I just think that that
scares me for you.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.900
Oh my God, I'm gonna
cry.

35:06.900 --> 35:15.133
This is exactly what I
was afraid of.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.967
So there is this woman
that Dr. Huang had me meet with

35:17.967 --> 35:20.133
that had a baby with a
surrogate.

35:20.133 --> 35:22.467
I just wanted to know what her
experience was.

35:22.467 --> 35:26.433
Like, is she...?
Does she love the baby the same?

35:26.433 --> 35:28.667
Does it feel the same?
Like, is she just as happy?

35:28.667 --> 35:30.600
You know?
So I've kind of come to the

35:30.600 --> 35:34.133
conclusion in my mind that,
okay, I can't carry another one.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.700
And now I just want to, like,
explore surrogacy.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.067
I just think that that
scares me for you.

35:40.067 --> 35:43.433
Like, what if she gives birth
and then grabs the baby and

35:43.433 --> 35:45.567
- makes a run for it?
- Well, I don't think she

35:45.567 --> 35:48.567
can.
Also, the best thing is I could

35:48.567 --> 35:54.967
have a new baby and have no one
know and live my life for a good

35:54.967 --> 36:00.000
year before we announce it.
But I don't know if it's for me.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.333
- Yeah?
- I really don't know.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.933
Wait, do you ever
post anything to your private

36:15.933 --> 36:18.367
- and public?
- Yeah, always.

36:18.367 --> 36:20.633
- I'm gonna grab my phone.
- So cute.

36:20.633 --> 36:23.100
That's what everyone's
doing, so I might as well do it,

36:23.100 --> 36:25.600
- too.
- Oh, my goodness!

36:25.600 --> 36:28.800
Oh, my gosh.
That is so small.

36:28.800 --> 36:33.933
Wait, I want to see
her.

36:33.933 --> 36:37.233
- So cute.
- That dog is so cute.

36:37.233 --> 36:40.400
Hey, guys.
Hi, Kenny.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.700
Do you guys want to chat for a
second about how this is gonna

36:43.700 --> 36:45.700
- go?
- Okay.

36:45.700 --> 36:49.700
Um, I'm gonna start out
by myself.

36:49.700 --> 36:54.167
I decide to ask my mom the
questions after all, but I'm

36:54.167 --> 36:57.167
nervous.
I don't want to make this a sad

36:57.167 --> 37:00.233
or emotional experience for my
mom.

37:00.233 --> 37:02.833
I'm gonna start slow and
hopefully get through the

37:02.833 --> 37:04.833
- interviews.
- Oh, whoa.

37:04.833 --> 37:06.833
- This is cool.
- Okay, Mom, you ready to

37:06.833 --> 37:08.833
- do this?
- Yeah.

37:08.833 --> 37:10.833
What year were you
born?

37:10.833 --> 37:14.433
- '34.
- 1934 or 1834?

37:14.433 --> 37:16.867
- 19.
- 1934.

37:16.867 --> 37:19.067
And your mom was how old when
she had you?

37:19.067 --> 37:21.067
- Probably 19.
- Wow.

37:21.067 --> 37:23.067
Really? So, like,
Kylie's age.

37:23.067 --> 37:25.533
Yeah, but in those days,
you know, that's what happened.

37:25.533 --> 37:28.667
How old were you when
you got kissed the first time?

37:28.667 --> 37:30.667
- 15.
- And who did you kiss?

37:30.667 --> 37:33.167
- Do you remember his name?
- Yeah, I married him.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.167
Oh, how amazing.
Her first kiss she married.

37:35.167 --> 37:37.167
- That's so cute.
- But we were only married

37:37.167 --> 37:39.500
- two months.
- Two months?

37:39.500 --> 37:43.300
Yeah. Less than Kimmy.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.300
What's your biggest
fear?

37:45.300 --> 37:48.833
Biggest fear.
I try not to fear.

37:48.833 --> 37:50.767
What's your biggest fear?

37:54.333 --> 37:56.967
I don't want to say it.

38:02.933 --> 38:07.333
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.

38:07.333 --> 38:11.233
- Just losing someone.
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna

38:11.233 --> 38:15.367
- cry.
- This is exactly what I

38:15.367 --> 38:17.667
was afraid of.

38:24.233 --> 38:27.633
What's your biggest fear?

38:30.633 --> 38:33.433
I don't want to say it.

38:39.367 --> 38:44.567
Why did you ask me that?
I can't believe I'm crying.

38:44.567 --> 38:49.333
- Just losing someone.
- Oh, my God, I'm gonna

38:49.333 --> 38:51.233
cry.

39:05.267 --> 39:08.133
- Just emotional.
- What are you upset

39:08.133 --> 39:10.333
- about?
- It makes me realize

39:10.333 --> 39:12.800
that she's not gonna always be
here and she's not gonna live

39:12.800 --> 39:15.367
- that much longer and...
- Yeah, but most people

39:15.367 --> 39:17.767
don't have the opportunity to
even get, like, these questions

39:17.767 --> 39:20.533
answered, you know?
So I think it's, like, a

39:20.533 --> 39:23.000
- blessing.
- Losing her... It's

39:23.000 --> 39:26.133
gonna be really hard when she's
not here.

39:26.133 --> 39:28.133
But... And I'm glad we're doing
this, but...

39:28.133 --> 39:30.233
And it's hard to lose
a parent.

39:30.233 --> 39:32.633
But you can't think like that.
Like, you can't be...

39:32.633 --> 39:34.633
But when you're talking
about someone's life...

39:34.633 --> 39:36.633
But she's had, like, a
great life, you know?

39:36.633 --> 39:38.633
- Yeah.
- And...

39:38.633 --> 39:40.633
- Yeah.
- ...at least she's had

39:40.633 --> 39:42.900
82 years.
You get to have these memories,

39:42.900 --> 39:45.433
and you get to do this.
Many people... Like my dad, I

39:45.433 --> 39:47.833
didn't have the op... You don't
get to talk about anything, you

39:47.833 --> 39:51.667
know?
So... we're lucky.

39:51.667 --> 39:53.967
I know that Khloe's
right.

39:53.967 --> 39:57.167
I'm just an emotional person
who... when I start talking to

39:57.167 --> 40:00.600
somebody I love, especially
about memories and anything

40:00.600 --> 40:04.633
about life, I just get real
mushy.

40:04.633 --> 40:08.433
So I just need to get one of my
kids to take over, so I can pull

40:08.433 --> 40:10.900
- it together.
- Are we ready?

40:10.900 --> 40:13.233
I'll start with the first
question.

40:13.233 --> 40:16.267
If you could only save one
grandchild, who would it be?

40:16.267 --> 40:18.967
- Oh, my God.
- I declare the fifth.

40:18.967 --> 40:23.733
The fifth grandchild?

40:23.733 --> 40:25.900
How many people have
you slept with?

40:25.900 --> 40:27.900
Oh, that's a good
question.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.100
- Four.
- Four total?

40:30.100 --> 40:34.333
No, four that I remember.

40:34.333 --> 40:37.133
Were you a party
animal?

40:37.133 --> 40:40.400
Uh, between husbands, I
went out a lot with the girls

40:40.400 --> 40:42.967
and went to bars and learned to
salsa and all that.

40:42.967 --> 40:45.200
Do you have any
favorite sayings or quotes that

40:45.200 --> 40:47.700
- you live by?
- Always try harder.

40:47.700 --> 40:51.367
Do your best.
That's all we can do.

40:51.367 --> 40:54.667
What is the best
thing about growing older?

40:54.667 --> 40:58.067
I figure if you make it
this far, it's all good.

40:58.067 --> 41:02.600
It's pretty awesome
seeing my kids interview MJ

41:02.600 --> 41:09.033
about her life and about her
story and her memories and just

41:09.033 --> 41:12.100
have it on film as something
that will last forever.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.200
Okay, I think we're
good.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.767
Yeah, we'll let
Khloe do it now.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.933
Mom, why don't you
come back out with me.

41:18.933 --> 41:23.467
- I would love to.
- Where'd you get your

41:23.467 --> 41:25.633
- style from?
- Probably my mom.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.867
And I think, you know, I love
the movies, and I think I got it

41:27.867 --> 41:29.867
- from that.
- 'Cause we always say

41:29.867 --> 41:33.267
we get it from you, because you
gave it to my mom.

41:33.267 --> 41:36.133
Do you wish you had a boyfriend
right now?

41:36.133 --> 41:39.033
Most of the guys that
would be my age are gone, number

41:39.033 --> 41:41.033
- one.
- You don't have to date

41:41.033 --> 41:43.033
anyone your age.
Look at Kris Jenner.

41:43.033 --> 41:47.333
Well, yeah.
Uh...

41:47.333 --> 41:49.567
What is your most
treasured possession?

41:49.567 --> 41:52.567
I don't know.
I don't like possessions.

41:52.567 --> 41:55.467
I'm not hoarding things for that
reason.

41:55.467 --> 41:57.467
I hoard them for sentimental
reasons.

41:57.467 --> 42:00.100
I do have a garage full of the
things you've sent over to my

42:00.100 --> 42:03.933
house, like chairs and things
you want to hoard.

42:03.933 --> 42:06.100
- They're all gone.
- Well, I save what I want

42:06.100 --> 42:08.100
- to.
- What do you think is

42:08.100 --> 42:10.667
the most precious thing that
you've kept?

42:10.667 --> 42:14.233
Well, now, let me think.
Your baby pictures?

42:14.233 --> 42:17.700
Aw.
If you could have one

42:17.700 --> 42:19.867
- superpower...
- That I could fly so I

42:19.867 --> 42:25.000
could go back and forth quicker
to see you.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.133
What's your idea of
perfect happiness?

42:28.133 --> 42:31.500
Well, being around all my
kids and, uh, seeing everyone

42:31.500 --> 42:34.567
happy.
I'm very happy to be here.

42:34.567 --> 42:36.567
Yeah, I like waking up in the
morning and saying, "Thank you,

42:36.567 --> 42:38.567
God.
One more day."

42:38.567 --> 42:40.700
- Aw.
- Yeah. Don't you?

42:40.700 --> 42:42.833
Mm-hmm.
- We're lucky.

42:42.833 --> 42:45.633
- Super lucky.
- Yeah. Blessed.

42:45.633 --> 42:48.700
All right. We're out.
Give me a hug.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.733
- Okay.
- I love you, Mom.

42:50.733 --> 42:53.167
- Love you, too.
- I'm so happy that I did

42:53.167 --> 42:56.267
this.
Khloe was right.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.867
It's definitely a lot more
sentimental and personal this

42:58.867 --> 43:01.833
way.
Thank God we have that on tape.

43:01.833 --> 43:04.767
- You know, forever.
- I know it's emotional,

43:04.767 --> 43:07.467
but most people don't get to do
this kind of stuff.

43:07.467 --> 43:09.967
I know. Thank you.
Love you.

43:09.967 --> 43:13.733
Love you, too.
Thank you.

43:13.733 --> 43:16.000
Sometimes the young
ones are smarter than the older

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
ones.
Keeping Up with

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
- the Kardashians...
- Have you read any baby

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
- books?
- No.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.033
Do you know how to
take care of a baby?

43:24.033 --> 43:26.200
No.
Is that okay, little girl?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.600
Poor guy just gave his
kid pinkeye.

43:28.600 --> 43:30.700
Kim, are you not
coming to my meeting?

43:30.700 --> 43:32.700
- What meeting?
- You always talk

43:32.700 --> 43:34.900
about Mom.
"Oh, she's a horrible manager."

43:34.900 --> 43:38.433
You're taking over for Mom when
you're acting just like Mom.

43:38.433 --> 43:40.933
Hey, Mom, I think
there's just been an accident.
