<i>Ty:</i> <i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.785 --> 00:03.620
I'm gonna recommend you
on our Heartland website.

00:03.687 --> 00:04.954
We get a ton of hits

00:05.023 --> 00:06.055
and I'm sure it'll fill up
your stable.

00:06.123 --> 00:07.756
Why would you do that for me?

00:07.824 --> 00:09.392
'Cause you care about horses;

00:09.459 --> 00:10.859
That says a lot about a person.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.829
What's wrong with her?

00:13.897 --> 00:15.464
I think it's strangles,

00:15.532 --> 00:17.366
<i>and you know what that means.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:18.901
You're under quarantine.

00:18.968 --> 00:20.102
Caleb: You can't come.

00:20.170 --> 00:21.937
Ashley: Why not?

00:22.005 --> 00:23.438
<i>Caleb:</i> <i>I know it sounds
stupid,</i> <i>but it's bad luck.</i>

00:23.506 --> 00:25.206
Look, the last time
I brought a girl,

00:25.274 --> 00:26.908
I lost like every event.

00:28.744 --> 00:29.944
(Horse whinnies wildly)

00:30.012 --> 00:32.479
Go, Caleb! Come on!
(Family cheers)

00:34.283 --> 00:36.017
(Pained grunt) Ungh!

(Hooves thunder)

01:19.492 --> 01:22.127
<i>Lou:</i> <i>But the quarantine</i>
<i>was lifted weeks ago.</i>

01:22.195 --> 01:26.263
And you do know that humans
can't get strangles, right?

01:26.331 --> 01:27.764
Fine. I understand.

01:27.832 --> 01:30.901
But your first night's deposit
is not refundable.

01:30.969 --> 01:32.603
Okay, thanks. Bye.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.538
(Phone beeps off)

01:34.606 --> 01:36.140
So, have you picked
your bridesmaid

01:36.208 --> 01:37.208
or maid of honour yet?

01:37.275 --> 01:38.609
Are you kidding me?

01:38.676 --> 01:40.111
I'm too busy trying
to piece back together

01:40.178 --> 01:41.412
this business.

01:41.480 --> 01:43.146
Well, you should've nailed
that by now.

01:43.214 --> 01:44.880
So who are you thinking
of asking?

01:44.948 --> 01:46.583
It says in this
wedding plan thing,

01:46.650 --> 01:48.218
that your bridesmaid
should be someone you've known

01:48.285 --> 01:49.486
for a really long time,

01:49.553 --> 01:51.654
someone who is loyal,
responsible.

01:54.458 --> 01:55.891
leading to your big day!

01:55.959 --> 01:57.793
Someone, in fact,
that is like...

01:57.861 --> 01:59.628
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Well, Amy's gonna be</i>
<i>my maid of honour, right?</i>

01:59.695 --> 02:01.230
Uh... wrong?

02:01.297 --> 02:02.797
What? Why not?

02:02.865 --> 02:04.633
Well, because you and I wouldn't
be speaking to each other

02:04.700 --> 02:05.634
by the wedding day.

02:05.701 --> 02:06.968
But you have to be,

02:07.036 --> 02:08.470
you're my sister!

02:08.538 --> 02:11.273
And I'll be your bridesmaid.
Just not maid of honour.

02:11.341 --> 02:12.574
What?!

02:12.642 --> 02:14.075
Amy: I'm sorry, Lou. Gotta go.

02:14.143 --> 02:16.277
Ty and I are seeing Caleb
at the hospital.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.411
(Huffs)

02:18.213 --> 02:19.847
So Amy is a bridesmaid.

02:19.914 --> 02:22.416
And it says here that
you should have two bridesmaids

02:22.484 --> 02:23.851
and a maid of honour.

02:23.918 --> 02:25.353
Well, I can make
a suggestion...

02:25.420 --> 02:28.856
Can you believe that?
Turned down by my own sister!

02:28.923 --> 02:31.124
Now what do I do?

02:31.192 --> 02:32.992
You want me to be
your maid of honour?

02:33.060 --> 02:35.128
You're the first person
I thought of.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.396
What about Amy?

02:36.464 --> 02:37.531
Ah, she's a little young

02:37.598 --> 02:39.999
to handle all
the responsibilities.

02:40.067 --> 02:41.501
Wow, uh...

02:42.436 --> 02:44.037
I'm touched.

02:44.905 --> 02:47.039
And I would love to be
your maid of honour.

02:47.106 --> 02:48.006
Fantastic.

02:48.074 --> 02:48.907
Yeah. That's great.

02:51.044 --> 02:52.978
Ty: Well, it looks like
Caleb's in a good space.

02:53.046 --> 02:55.781
Amy: Yeah.
Amazing, considering what happened.

02:57.016 --> 02:58.317
At least he'll be out soon.

02:58.385 --> 03:00.619
Yeah. Ty! Ty, look out!

03:00.687 --> 03:01.987
(Horses whinny, tires screech)

03:02.055 --> 03:03.120

Good boy.

Good boy.

04:08.984 --> 04:11.753
Amy: Ty, these horses
aren't in great shape.

04:11.820 --> 04:15.022
Yeah, this guys ribs
are showing.

04:15.090 --> 04:16.523
I think these are
Mr. Hanley's fields.

04:16.591 --> 04:19.192
They must be his horses.

04:19.261 --> 04:20.827
Huh, let's get them back.

04:20.896 --> 04:21.894
'Kay.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.834
So there's just a few things

04:27.902 --> 04:31.537
that you can help me with
to get started...

04:31.605 --> 04:33.173
If you don't mind?

04:33.241 --> 04:34.174
No. Not at all.

04:34.242 --> 04:35.041
Great.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.109
Number one on the list

04:36.177 --> 04:37.977
is probably
the engagement party,

04:38.044 --> 04:39.078
since you'll be hosting.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.712
And, uh, it is so hard

04:40.781 --> 04:43.448
working around Peter's
crazy schedule.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.351
He's got this... flight.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.520
Unbelievable!

04:49.455 --> 04:51.423
Another cancellation
at the dude ranch.

04:51.491 --> 04:52.457
Business is bad?

04:52.525 --> 04:54.025
People will not believe me

04:54.093 --> 04:57.228
when I say that humans
cannot get equine viruses

04:57.296 --> 04:58.997
like strangles.

04:59.932 --> 05:01.399
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:01.466 --> 05:02.667
I really need an idea

05:02.734 --> 05:05.103
to get business rolling again
'cause...

05:05.171 --> 05:06.537
After I had Jerry Junior,

05:06.605 --> 05:09.473
I felt totally out
of the picture, work-wise.

05:09.541 --> 05:11.741
But then I met these other moms
at Gymboree.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.010
Gymboree?

05:13.077 --> 05:14.044
Yeah. Turns out
they all missed work

05:14.112 --> 05:15.279
as much as I did.

05:15.346 --> 05:16.746
But they had terrific ideas

05:16.815 --> 05:18.615
about starting their own
small home businesses,

05:18.683 --> 05:21.051
so... I formed "WWAHH."

05:21.119 --> 05:23.020
W-W-A-H-H:

05:23.087 --> 05:24.721
Women Working At Home
in Hudson.

05:24.789 --> 05:25.755
Cute.

05:25.823 --> 05:27.056
You should join us.

05:27.124 --> 05:28.357
Oh, thank you,

05:28.425 --> 05:29.926
but I don't see how
making quilts

05:29.993 --> 05:31.194
and seasonal door wreaths

05:31.261 --> 05:32.661
is really gonna help
my business right now.

05:32.729 --> 05:33.830
Lou...

05:33.897 --> 05:35.331
These women, they're lawyers,

05:35.398 --> 05:37.599
graphic artists, accountants.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.168
It's been great for networking.

05:39.236 --> 05:41.704
My catering business
has gone crazy as a result.

05:41.771 --> 05:43.738
But, you know,
if you're not interested.

05:43.806 --> 05:46.274
No, I'm... I'm interested.

05:47.176 --> 05:48.343
I'm very interested.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.013
So, I hear Caleb's
due back any day now.

05:52.081 --> 05:53.548
Yes.

05:53.615 --> 05:54.682
Yes.

05:54.750 --> 05:55.750
And he's insisting he's fine

05:55.818 --> 05:58.385
to live in that trailer of his.

05:58.453 --> 06:00.587
I'm here to tell you
he's not ready for that.

06:00.655 --> 06:02.289
I told him he could stay
at Briar Ridge...

06:02.357 --> 06:04.725
For a little while anay.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.227
But you know Caleb.

06:06.294 --> 06:08.528
I mean, he's almost
as stubborn as you are.

06:08.596 --> 06:09.830
(Laughs)

06:11.399 --> 06:14.433
So, uh,
how's Ashley holding up?

06:14.501 --> 06:16.802
Well, I gotta hand it
to her, Jack.

06:16.871 --> 06:19.772
I mean, she's been by his side
practically 24/7,

06:19.840 --> 06:21.574
ever since the accident.

06:21.641 --> 06:23.809
You know Caleb was pretty down
at first, right?

06:23.878 --> 06:25.111
Well, understandable.

06:25.179 --> 06:28.281
Yeah, but Ashley...
(Reflective breath)

06:28.349 --> 06:30.983
She is such a positive force
for him,

06:31.050 --> 06:32.417
I can't tell you.

06:32.485 --> 06:33.718
Who knew my daughter channelled

06:33.786 --> 06:35.387
an inner Florence Nightingale, huh?

06:35.454 --> 06:37.055
Both: (Chuckling)

06:37.123 --> 06:39.091
Don't you worry about Caleb.

06:39.158 --> 06:40.292
Between the two of us,

06:40.360 --> 06:42.194
we'll make sure
he's looked after.

06:42.262 --> 06:43.595
Thank you, Jack.

06:43.662 --> 06:45.463
I appreciate that.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.797
(Chuckles warmly)

06:46.865 --> 06:48.933
<i>(Front door opens)</i>
<i>Lisa: Hello?!</i>

06:49.001 --> 06:50.268
Lisa!

06:50.335 --> 06:51.936
(Stammers awkwardly)

06:52.004 --> 06:54.805
I thought you weren't coming
back till next week?

06:54.873 --> 06:57.108
Yeah, no, I came home early
and, uh...

06:57.175 --> 06:58.776
Came straight from the airport
to surprise you,

06:58.843 --> 07:01.879
which it seems
that I certainly did.

07:01.946 --> 07:04.014
(Laughs nervously)

07:05.182 --> 07:07.717
It's good to see you back
safe and sound, Lisa.

07:07.785 --> 07:08.919
<i>Um...</i>

07:08.986 --> 07:11.221
I know Jack has missed you.

07:11.289 --> 07:13.790
And, uh, I was just leaving.
(Laughs)

07:13.857 --> 07:17.093
So, I'll see you, Jack,
and thanks for the coffee.

07:18.261 --> 07:19.995
Val: Bye.
Lisa: Bye.

07:22.899 --> 07:25.200
Oh, look at you.

07:25.268 --> 07:27.536
You just made my day.

07:27.603 --> 07:28.938
Both: (Chuckle)

07:30.740 --> 07:31.974
- Hi cowboy.
- Hi.

07:35.177 --> 07:36.311
(Hooves thud)

07:37.246 --> 07:38.446
(Horse whinnies)

07:39.381 --> 07:40.448

07:47.923 --> 07:48.990

07:50.058 --> 07:51.124
(Cat meows)

07:58.099 --> 08:00.167
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Mr. Hanley?</i>

08:02.370 --> 08:05.272
Mr. Hanley?!
(Light switch clicks)

08:07.140 --> 08:08.608
(Door rattles)

08:08.676 --> 08:09.709
You find him?

08:09.777 --> 08:11.611
Uh, no.

08:11.679 --> 08:13.112
Well, he's not in the house.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.949
And his truck's not here.
So I'm thinking he's in town.

08:16.016 --> 08:17.350
I did a patch job on the gate.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.552
But it needs to be fixed
properly.

08:19.620 --> 08:20.820
Okay.

08:20.888 --> 08:22.789
And there's a cat
that's dying to be fed.

08:22.857 --> 08:25.257
Amy: (Scoffed laughter)
All right.

08:26.193 --> 08:28.527
(Marker scratches on paper)

08:34.534 --> 08:37.203
<i>Amy:</i> <i>All right, let's go.</i>

08:39.205 --> 08:41.639
Still no answer
at Mr. Hanley's.

08:41.707 --> 08:43.741
Well, maybe he got stuck
somewhere overnight.

08:43.808 --> 08:45.543
Well, if he's not back
by morning,

08:45.611 --> 08:47.479
we're gonna have to go check
on his horses again.

08:47.546 --> 08:49.146
So nice to see you have
all the time in the world

08:49.214 --> 08:50.180
for Mr. Hanley,

08:50.248 --> 08:51.615
practically a total stranger,

08:51.682 --> 08:54.351
yet you don't have a minute
for your own sister.

08:54.419 --> 08:55.619
What's she talking about?

08:55.686 --> 08:57.054
Oh, she didn't tell you?

08:57.122 --> 08:59.589
She flat out refused
to be my maid of honour.

08:59.657 --> 09:01.225
You'll thank me later,
believe me.

09:01.292 --> 09:03.560
Besides, I'm sure
you've found someone.

09:03.628 --> 09:04.994
I already did - Marnie -

09:05.062 --> 09:06.162
and she's thrilled.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.897
Oh, well, that's great.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.632
Not only is she gonna
be my maid of honour

09:09.699 --> 09:12.001
she introduced me to WWAHH.

09:12.069 --> 09:13.236
Amy: WWAAH?
Ty: Ww...WWAHH?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.238
Women Working At Home
in Hudson.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.539
Don't laugh!

09:16.606 --> 09:18.408
It's clever. That is awesome.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.942
It's a pretty powerful
networking group, okay?

09:21.010 --> 09:22.310
And you've probably
already joined?

09:22.378 --> 09:23.945
Yes, and I'm hosting
their first meeting.

09:24.013 --> 09:25.213
Stop it.

09:25.281 --> 09:26.648
It's a great way
to get the word out

09:26.715 --> 09:28.583
the equestrian connection
is up and running.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.552
I'm sure. Hello?

09:31.521 --> 09:34.423
Uh, yeah. Just a sec, Marnie.

09:35.791 --> 09:38.592
Hey, I was just gonna call you.

09:38.660 --> 09:42.696
So, why didn't you wanna be
her maid of honour?

09:42.764 --> 09:44.031
Well, you know what?

09:44.099 --> 09:45.533
I was actually thinking
for the bridal shower

09:45.600 --> 09:48.769
more of a goddess theme.

09:48.836 --> 09:49.770
That's why.

09:49.837 --> 09:50.771
Yeah.

09:50.838 --> 09:52.405
(Truck rumbles)

09:55.709 --> 09:59.612
I never thought my trailer
could look so good.

10:04.751 --> 10:05.851
I'll get your wheelchair.

10:05.919 --> 10:07.387
No, um...

10:07.455 --> 10:08.920
Could you just grab my crutch.

10:08.988 --> 10:10.055
Yeah.

10:12.158 --> 10:13.892
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:15.861 --> 10:18.930
You smell that?
That's fresh air.

10:18.998 --> 10:21.600
No more hospital smell for me.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.368
You know, there's a-
(Pained grunt)

10:23.436 --> 10:25.636
I'm... I'm good.
It's all right.

10:25.704 --> 10:27.472
There's fresh air
at Briar Ridge, too.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.107
You know, you can't stay here
out here on your own.

10:29.174 --> 10:31.476
Ash, been looking after myself
since I was 16,

10:31.543 --> 10:33.411
and I'll be damned if I let
a couple of broken bones

10:33.479 --> 10:34.312
change that.

10:34.379 --> 10:36.347
Okay. Well...

10:36.415 --> 10:37.715
Gotta admit, cowboy,

10:37.782 --> 10:40.250
your positive attitude
is really amazing.

10:43.721 --> 10:45.589
I'm so proud of you.

10:45.656 --> 10:47.591
It's good to have you
back home.

10:47.658 --> 10:48.791
Thanks.

10:53.131 --> 10:55.098
Hey, boy, come here.

10:55.166 --> 10:57.166
Look what I got for you.

10:57.234 --> 11:00.236
I won't forget you either.
Here you go.

11:01.171 --> 11:03.305
(Car rumbles up driveway)

11:11.314 --> 11:13.681
Woman: Excuse me, who are you?

11:13.749 --> 11:15.883
What are you doing here?

11:15.951 --> 11:20.121
I'm Amy Fleming.
I'm a friend of Mr. Hanley's.

11:20.189 --> 11:21.656
I'm just looking
after his horses.

11:21.723 --> 11:25.726
Oh. Oh, I'm a friend too.
Is he around?

11:25.794 --> 11:27.529
No. Uh...

11:27.596 --> 11:29.229
Have you seen him?
We were actually wondering-

11:29.297 --> 11:32.132
No, I haven't. Not for a while.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.134
Oh.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.703
I guess I'll be going.

11:38.806 --> 11:42.476
(Horse snuffles,
car engine revs and whirs)

11:45.212 --> 11:47.213
Ty: I checked the water
pump in the field.

11:47.281 --> 11:49.582
There's a reason the horses
broke out yesterday.

11:49.650 --> 11:50.616
They were looking for water.

11:50.684 --> 11:53.586
Huh. What about the troughs?

11:53.654 --> 11:55.188
They were empty.
I had to fill them by hand

11:55.255 --> 11:56.455
'cause the pump isn't working.

11:56.523 --> 11:58.023
I think the power's off.

11:58.091 --> 11:59.858
That explains why there's
no lights on in the barn.

11:59.926 --> 12:01.326
Ty, it's supposed to drop
below zero tonight,

12:01.394 --> 12:02.694
those troughs
are just gonna freeze.

12:02.761 --> 12:04.162
I know, I know.

12:04.230 --> 12:06.130
And there's not a lot
of hay left either.

12:06.199 --> 12:09.267
Where is Mr. Hanley?
What's going on here?

12:11.270 --> 12:13.004
I found these earlier.

12:14.373 --> 12:16.873
They're bills. All unpaid.

12:22.461 --> 12:23.861
Jack: I hate to say it,

12:24.180 --> 12:26.281
but it wouldn't surprise me
if he's taken off.

12:26.348 --> 12:27.382
That's what I think.

12:27.449 --> 12:28.683
Amy: No. There's no way.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.817
It's happening a lot right now.

12:30.885 --> 12:34.020
<i>Running a ranch is a struggle</i>
<i>at the best of times.</i>

12:34.088 --> 12:36.623
Throw a recession
into the mix and...

12:36.691 --> 12:38.458
A sad story,
but I have heard cases

12:38.526 --> 12:41.094
<i>where the owners have shot</i>
<i>their horses before they left,</i>

12:41.162 --> 12:43.797
<i>rather than let 'em</i>
<i>starve to death.</i>

12:43.864 --> 12:45.732
Mallory: That's awful.

12:45.800 --> 12:46.965
Hey!

12:47.033 --> 12:48.334
I wouldn't put it past
Mr. Hanley.

12:48.402 --> 12:49.735
That guy is creepy.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.338
Mr. Hanley may be
a little bit eccentric.

12:52.406 --> 12:54.039
But he loves his horses, okay.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.108
He wouldn't abandon them.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.511
Jack:
I hope you're right.

12:58.579 --> 12:59.845
Hey, uh...

12:59.913 --> 13:02.006
I think we should board
his horses here until he shows up.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.315
Absolutely not.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.150
Please tell me that this
has nothing to do

13:05.218 --> 13:06.752
with me not wanting to be
your maid of honour.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.020
<i>Lou:</i> <i>No, this has to
do</i> <i>with the fact</i>

13:08.088 --> 13:09.654
that we can't take
that kind of risk.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.056
I mean, all we need
is a bunch of horses

13:11.124 --> 13:12.524
<i>we don't know anything about</i>

13:12.592 --> 13:14.059
to bring a virus like strangles
to us again.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.028
She's right, Amy.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.362
Mallory: Absolutely.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.463
You should just listen
to Lou, Amy.

13:19.531 --> 13:20.564
Amy: Okay. Okay.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.834
But until he shows up,

13:22.901 --> 13:25.236
we are gonna have to go
and feed them everyday.

13:25.303 --> 13:26.337
Coming.

13:29.274 --> 13:31.508
Aren't you glad
I backed you up on that, Lou?

13:31.576 --> 13:33.211
Yeah.

13:33.278 --> 13:35.946
So, have you made a decision
on your second bridesmaid?

13:36.013 --> 13:38.248
The clock is ticking.

13:40.818 --> 13:42.152
(Vehicle whirs)

13:43.755 --> 13:46.256
Jack: Hey there!
Lisa: Hi!

13:46.323 --> 13:48.925
I was hoping that
I could convince you

13:48.993 --> 13:50.360
to come on a little drive
with me.

13:50.427 --> 13:51.526
I have to look at a couple
of horses,

13:51.594 --> 13:53.595
and I would love your opinion.

13:53.663 --> 13:54.830
Sure thing.

13:54.898 --> 13:56.665
Just let me get cleaned up
a bit.

13:58.368 --> 13:59.835
(Car door opens)

13:59.903 --> 14:00.970
<i>Val:</i> <i>Hi!</i>

14:02.205 --> 14:03.272
Hi, Lisa.

14:03.339 --> 14:04.373
Val.

14:05.808 --> 14:07.675
(Sighs)
Well, Caleb's back.

14:07.743 --> 14:09.010
Yeah, where's he staying?

14:09.878 --> 14:10.779
(Sighs)
In his trailer.

14:10.846 --> 14:12.981
Like I told you, he's crazy.

14:13.048 --> 14:14.448
Yeah, tell you what.

14:14.516 --> 14:16.151
Why don't you invite Ashley
and Caleb over here

14:16.218 --> 14:16.985
for supper tonight,

14:17.052 --> 14:18.319
and you come, too,

14:18.387 --> 14:20.889
and we'll give him
a proper welcome back.

14:20.956 --> 14:22.190
That's really nice, Jack,
thank you.

14:22.258 --> 14:23.590
I'll run it by the kids,

14:23.658 --> 14:24.624
and I'll bring
my shepherd's pie.

14:24.692 --> 14:25.859
You loved it the last time.

14:25.927 --> 14:27.261
Jack: Mmm!

14:27.328 --> 14:28.962
I'm off for a ride on Electra.
See ya later.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.363
Have fun.

14:33.367 --> 14:35.068
She seems to be spending
a lot of time here.

14:35.136 --> 14:37.171
Yeah, well, she's taken up
show jumping again,

14:37.238 --> 14:39.338
if you can believe that.

14:39.406 --> 14:40.706
Amy's training her.

14:40.774 --> 14:44.110
Why is she not using
the trainers at Briar Ridge?

14:44.178 --> 14:45.778
Doesn't want 'em to know,
I guess.

14:45.846 --> 14:47.914
Says she's embarrassed.

14:47.981 --> 14:50.382
Okay, I will come with you
to look at that horse

14:50.450 --> 14:51.818
on one condition.

14:51.885 --> 14:52.885
What's that?

14:52.953 --> 14:54.720
That you promise me

14:54.788 --> 14:57.122
that you will stay
for supper tonight.

14:57.190 --> 14:59.324
Oh, I get an invitation too,
do I?

15:00.259 --> 15:01.592
(Truck rumbles)

15:11.704 --> 15:13.638
Well, this should keep 'em
for awhile.

15:13.706 --> 15:15.440
<i>Barb:</i> <i>Knock, knock.</i>

15:15.507 --> 15:16.907
Hi.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.975
Hi. Uh, can we help you?

15:19.043 --> 15:22.379
Yeah, I'm Peace Officer Wharton
from Alberta SPCA.

15:22.447 --> 15:23.980
We received a call
from a concerned citizen

15:24.048 --> 15:26.717
who thinks that the owner,
Levon Hanley,

15:26.784 --> 15:27.818
may have abandoned his horses.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.219
No, that's not true.

15:29.286 --> 15:30.787
Oh, is he here, then?

15:30.855 --> 15:32.121
Well, no. He's not, but-

15:32.189 --> 15:33.922
But he wouldn't do
something like that.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.524
He loves his horses too much.

15:35.592 --> 15:38.427
There's gotta be a good reason
why he's not here.

15:38.495 --> 15:41.330
There are no good reasons
to leave horses to starve.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.131
Okay, but we're looking
after the horses

15:43.199 --> 15:45.868
until he gets back,
so there's no problem here.

15:45.935 --> 15:47.302
<i>Ty:</i> <i>Yeah.</i>

15:47.371 --> 15:48.804
Look, I think what you guys
are doing here is great,

15:48.872 --> 15:50.972
and I'll pass that along
to my superiors.

15:51.039 --> 15:53.808
But Levon Hanley
could be in big trouble.

15:53.876 --> 15:56.978
Now here is a warning
notification.

15:57.045 --> 15:58.212
Now, there's a good chance
he'll be charged

15:58.280 --> 15:59.748
for neglecting his animals

15:59.815 --> 16:02.817
and these horses may be seized.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.221
<i>Lisa:</i> <i>Well, I spent one
week</i> <i>at my place in France</i>

16:07.289 --> 16:10.724
<i>and then flew to Austria</i>
<i>to check out some horses.</i>

16:10.792 --> 16:13.261
<i>Then the very last week</i>
<i>was in Rome.</i>

16:13.328 --> 16:14.996
Just Rome, fabulous.
No business,

16:15.063 --> 16:17.298
just visiting old friends.

16:19.101 --> 16:20.768
Sounds wonderful.

16:20.835 --> 16:24.470
Too bad you can never convince
this one to go with you, huh?

16:24.538 --> 16:26.072
Yes. It is.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.673
Let's not go there.

16:27.741 --> 16:31.211
Does anybody need sugar
for their coffee? I do.

16:31.279 --> 16:33.380
<i>Jack:</i> <i>You kids, can you
start</i> <i>cleaning up this table?</i>

16:33.447 --> 16:36.716
Oh... well, you know,
for purely selfish reasons,

16:36.784 --> 16:40.052
I am really glad Jack
is a homebody.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.320
I can tell you,

16:41.388 --> 16:42.454
I don't know
what I would have done

16:42.522 --> 16:44.689
without him
these past few months.

16:44.757 --> 16:46.392
He couldn't do enough for me.

16:46.459 --> 16:48.527
Hmm. Well, I think...

16:49.629 --> 16:52.064
I think I'm gonna go.

16:52.132 --> 16:53.732
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Oh, you're leaving?</i>
<i>Already?</i>

16:53.800 --> 16:54.999
Lisa:
Yeah, I think I'm just wiped.

16:55.067 --> 16:58.403
It must be jet lag,
or something.

17:01.073 --> 17:02.240
Good night, everybody.

17:02.308 --> 17:03.341
Ashley, Caleb and Amy:
Good night.

17:03.409 --> 17:05.042
I wish you didn't have to go.

17:05.109 --> 17:07.278
Well, it seems like
you're in good hands.

17:07.346 --> 17:08.413
Eh?

17:09.481 --> 17:11.214
Jack: Oh. Well, get some sleep.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.983
And, um, I'll see you tomorrow.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.517
<i>Lisa:</i> <i>Yeah.</i>

17:15.886 --> 17:17.554
(Front door closes)

17:18.489 --> 17:20.223
Table.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.858
We're on it.

17:23.328 --> 17:24.894
Ty: Hey, so what's the word?

17:24.963 --> 17:27.163
They think you're gonna make
a full recovery?

17:27.230 --> 17:28.764
I go in for X-rays
in a few days,

17:28.832 --> 17:30.066
so I'll know more
about it then.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.733
Ah, he's been so incredible.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.170
The doctors are amazed
how fast he's back on his feet.

17:34.237 --> 17:35.671
Totally amazing!

17:35.738 --> 17:38.274
Ashley Stanton, everyone.
My personal cheering squad.

17:38.342 --> 17:40.076
Oh, he'll be back competing
in no time,

17:40.143 --> 17:41.210
good as new,

17:41.278 --> 17:42.243
like the whole thing
never happened.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.544
Right, sweetie?

17:43.612 --> 17:44.879
Yeah.

17:44.947 --> 17:45.947
<i>Ashley:</i>
<i>Well, we'd better hit the road.</i>

17:46.015 --> 17:48.316
It's time for you
to go to sleep.

17:48.384 --> 17:50.518
Hey Mom, you ready to go?

17:51.220 --> 17:52.520
Is it just me,

17:52.588 --> 17:55.123
or are Caleb and Ashley
acting a little weird?

17:55.191 --> 17:56.358
You mean, aside from the fact

17:56.425 --> 17:58.592
that she's acting
like a Stepford wife?

17:58.659 --> 17:59.759
Yeah.

18:00.695 --> 18:02.396
(Wind gusts)

18:04.532 --> 18:06.100
(Sporadic breaths)

18:10.671 --> 18:13.007
(Echoed cries, horse whinnies)

18:13.074 --> 18:13.807
(Grunts)

18:15.376 --> 18:17.610
(Echoed grunt of pain)

18:17.677 --> 18:19.145
(Gasps and pants)

18:28.055 --> 18:31.123
(Caleb pants,
wind whistles outside)

18:48.774 --> 18:51.576
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Ty, I think we should</i>
<i>turn these guys out today.</i>

18:51.644 --> 18:53.778
That's a good idea.

18:56.549 --> 18:57.615
Mr. Hanley!

18:58.717 --> 18:59.851
<i>Thank God you're okay.</i>

18:59.919 --> 19:00.985
We were worried sick about you.

19:01.053 --> 19:02.553
Where have you been?

19:02.620 --> 19:04.387
It doesn't matter
where I've been.

19:04.455 --> 19:05.956
Well, yeah. It does.

19:06.024 --> 19:08.091
We were looking after
your horses for days.

19:08.159 --> 19:09.392
Thanks for that.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.494
There's no water
and the power's off.

19:11.563 --> 19:12.696
I know.

19:13.998 --> 19:15.465
Look, I need you to understand.

19:15.533 --> 19:18.435
I depend on my boarders.
They keep me...

19:18.502 --> 19:20.736
Well, they keep the place
going.

19:20.804 --> 19:22.171
But...

19:22.238 --> 19:24.173
They couldn't make
their payments.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.775
Okay, so...

19:25.842 --> 19:27.843
What do you think?

19:27.911 --> 19:30.379
One by one, they pulled out.

19:31.314 --> 19:33.215
You know what it's like
when the money dries up

19:33.283 --> 19:35.216
but the bills keep coming in?

19:35.284 --> 19:36.551
(Horse nickers)

19:36.619 --> 19:37.819
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>So, these aren't your boarders?</i>

19:37.887 --> 19:41.590
No. They're from a farm
a couple of roads over.

19:41.657 --> 19:43.458
They were gonna put them down.

19:43.525 --> 19:45.393
Couldn't stand that.

19:45.461 --> 19:48.063
So I brought them here.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.965
You rescued them?

19:50.032 --> 19:53.467
Yeah. I rescued them all right.

19:53.534 --> 19:55.435
And I left 'em.

19:55.503 --> 19:57.170
<i>I was scared.</i>

19:58.406 --> 20:00.273
So, you abandoned your animals.

20:00.341 --> 20:02.076
I came back.

20:02.143 --> 20:04.111
You're a little late.

20:04.178 --> 20:05.679
Animal Welfare
was already here.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.847
<i>They're deciding what to do</i>
<i>with your horses.</i>

20:07.915 --> 20:09.482
And, you know,
the only reason we found them

20:09.549 --> 20:12.184
was 'cause they'd escaped -
they were looking for water.

20:12.252 --> 20:15.722
They could have been killed
on that road.

20:17.891 --> 20:19.558
And I defended you.

20:28.642 --> 20:29.775
<i>(Car rumbles)</i>

20:42.255 --> 20:43.788
(Knocking)

20:43.857 --> 20:44.890
Caleb?

20:50.663 --> 20:51.663
(Knocking)

20:51.731 --> 20:52.797
Caleb?

20:57.302 --> 20:58.936
(Door clunks shut)

20:59.004 --> 21:00.637
(Gasps) Oh my God!

21:00.705 --> 21:01.772
Caleb! Caleb!

21:02.674 --> 21:03.841
Wake up! (Caleb groans)

21:03.909 --> 21:06.244
Oh my God... Are you okay?!

21:06.879 --> 21:07.945
Caleb?!

21:10.916 --> 21:11.849
<i>Val:</i> <i>Oh.</i>

21:11.917 --> 21:13.683
Val, hello.

21:13.751 --> 21:15.418
Hi, Lisa. How are ya?

21:15.486 --> 21:17.453
Oh, that's a nice bridle.

21:17.521 --> 21:19.789
Jack tells me you're
show-jumping again.

21:19.857 --> 21:21.590
(Laughs) Yeah.

21:22.058 --> 21:23.825
I guess I'm trying
to prove the adage wrong:

21:23.894 --> 21:25.995
You can teach an old dog
a new trick.

21:26.062 --> 21:27.462
Or...

21:27.530 --> 21:29.231
At least a trick I haven't
tried in a long, long time.

21:29.299 --> 21:30.632
Mm-hm.

21:30.700 --> 21:35.470
Val, I wanted to thank you
for keeping Jack company

21:35.538 --> 21:37.671
while I'm away.

21:38.607 --> 21:40.608
It's my pleasure.

21:41.543 --> 21:42.743
I'm sure it is.

21:42.811 --> 21:44.045
Oh, and you're working
with Amy now,

21:44.113 --> 21:46.881
so you're gonna be
at Heartland a lot more?

21:46.949 --> 21:48.783
I guess so. Yeah.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.051
I guess if we time it right,

21:50.119 --> 21:52.185
you could be at dinner
every night.

21:52.253 --> 21:54.788
What's that supposed to mean?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.123
Nothing. (Sighs)

21:56.190 --> 21:57.257
Lisa...

21:59.093 --> 22:00.794
I'm not gonna lie to you.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.796
When I was sick,
I made a bucket list,

22:02.863 --> 22:06.333
and item number four
on that bucket list

22:06.401 --> 22:09.101
says "spend more time
with people I care about."

22:09.169 --> 22:11.637
And Jack is one
of those people?

22:11.704 --> 22:13.572
Well, as you should know
better than anyone,

22:13.640 --> 22:15.942
Jack is a really great guy

22:16.009 --> 22:17.276
and I've known him
for a very long time.

22:17.344 --> 22:20.313
So, yeah,
as long as he'll let me,

22:20.380 --> 22:23.615
I plan on keeping him
in my life.

22:23.683 --> 22:26.952
(Diner door opens)

22:27.019 --> 22:28.086
Great.

22:29.655 --> 22:32.490
How many women are coming
to this WWAHH thing? 50?

22:32.558 --> 22:33.959
Twelve.

22:34.026 --> 22:35.726
Rule number one
of being a good hostess:

22:35.794 --> 22:37.362
Never let your guests
go hungry.

22:37.430 --> 22:38.830
Excellent rule.

22:38.897 --> 22:40.730
Oh, Mallory, you used
the wrong serving platter.

22:40.798 --> 22:42.666
I said, round for the veggies,

22:42.733 --> 22:44.034
square for the mini-quiches.

22:44.102 --> 22:46.570
Who cares what platter?

22:47.872 --> 22:48.839
Not a problem.

22:48.906 --> 22:51.008
I'll just start all over again.

22:51.076 --> 22:53.077
"Helpful" is my middle name.

22:53.144 --> 22:54.678
Okay...

22:54.745 --> 22:57.380
Any progress
on the bridesmaid issue?

22:57.448 --> 22:58.982
I don't know,
I left a message for Mackenzie

22:59.049 --> 23:00.984
but I haven't heard back
from her yet.

23:01.051 --> 23:02.285
Mackenzie?

23:02.353 --> 23:05.021
Crazy neurotic Mackenzie
who you barely know?

23:05.089 --> 23:06.622
Yeah.

23:06.690 --> 23:09.392
I just remembered
I have to go home.

23:09.460 --> 23:11.060
What about the veggies?

23:11.128 --> 23:13.428
Caleb:
There's no way I'm moving.

23:13.496 --> 23:16.164
See what I mean?
Jack, tell him.

23:16.232 --> 23:17.532
He can't stay at the trailer
by himself,

23:17.600 --> 23:18.867
it's way too dangerous.

23:18.934 --> 23:20.002
Look, Ash...

23:21.604 --> 23:22.770
I'm not staying with your mom.

23:22.838 --> 23:24.272
Why not?

23:24.340 --> 23:25.807
Why are you being so stubborn?!

23:25.875 --> 23:28.009
Jack: Oh, will you
two knock it off,

23:28.076 --> 23:29.543
please?!

23:29.611 --> 23:32.846
Caleb, you can't stay
in the trailer by yourself,

23:32.914 --> 23:34.515
not until your cast comes off.

23:34.582 --> 23:36.384
Thank you!

23:36.451 --> 23:38.719
Jack: And Ashley, Caleb does not
have to stay at Briar Ridge.

23:38.786 --> 23:40.954
Thank you!

23:41.023 --> 23:42.323
You can stay here with us.

23:42.391 --> 23:43.824
<i>Caleb:</i> <i>Uh, Jack,</i>

23:43.892 --> 23:45.125
<i>look, I know you're</i>
<i>just trying to help,</i>

23:45.192 --> 23:47.693
but you gotta understand.

23:47.761 --> 23:50.830
Look, I spent weeks cooped up
in that hospital.

23:50.898 --> 23:52.232
I need some privacy.

23:52.299 --> 23:53.866
I can't just be bunking here
with everyone.

23:53.934 --> 23:55.101
Yeah, I get that.

23:55.169 --> 23:58.671
So stay in a cabin
at the dude ranch then.

23:58.739 --> 24:01.573
Well, they are empty,
aren't they?

24:01.641 --> 24:03.475
Thanks for the reminder.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.710
Yes, Caleb, you can stay
at the dude ranch

24:05.778 --> 24:08.780
until your cast comes off
or I get a paying customer -

24:08.848 --> 24:11.116
whatever comes first.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.318
Okay. I accept the offer.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.854
Thanks, Jack.
(Lou clears her throat)

24:15.922 --> 24:17.488
Thanks, Lou.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.560
(Feed rustles)

24:28.200 --> 24:29.700
What's your problem
with Mr. Hanley?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.269
You're kidding, right?

24:31.336 --> 24:32.802
He came back, Amy.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.371
I know he never should've
took off,

24:34.439 --> 24:36.005
but he did come back.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.741
Yeah. How he could've ever
left them in the first place?

24:38.809 --> 24:40.944
It's like abandoning a child.

24:41.011 --> 24:43.146
(Vehicle rumbles outside)

24:48.052 --> 24:49.118
Hey.

24:52.456 --> 24:56.292
I just came by to thank you
for all you did for me.

24:56.359 --> 24:57.759
It's no problem.

24:58.628 --> 25:00.429
How're the horses?

25:00.497 --> 25:01.964
Animal Welfare called.

25:02.031 --> 25:03.832
They've charged me for neglect.

25:03.900 --> 25:06.634
They're taking the horses.

25:08.137 --> 25:09.404
20 odd years working the place,

25:09.472 --> 25:11.872
and now it's all gone.

25:14.210 --> 25:15.943
Well, I'm sure things
will get better.

25:16.261 --> 25:20.497
No, it's too late.
Bank's foreclosing.

25:28.138 --> 25:30.039
Thanks for everything.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.447
Poor guy.
He didn't look too good.

25:38.515 --> 25:40.816
Yeah, well,
he brought it on himself.

25:40.884 --> 25:42.084
He made some mistakes.

25:42.151 --> 25:43.318
Those horses are probably
gonna be put down

25:43.387 --> 25:45.320
- because of him.
- Amy!

25:45.856 --> 25:47.790
We all make mistakes.

25:47.858 --> 25:49.191
And Mr. Hanley made a big one,

25:49.259 --> 25:51.660
there's no question about it.

25:51.728 --> 25:52.761
But how can we really know

25:52.828 --> 25:56.097
what it was like for him?

25:56.164 --> 25:57.265
You give the horses
you work with

25:57.332 --> 25:59.734
hundreds of chances.

26:02.137 --> 26:03.938
Mr. Hanley loves those animals,

26:04.006 --> 26:05.840
you know that as well as I do.

26:05.908 --> 26:07.074
And he's about to lose
everything

26:07.142 --> 26:09.710
that's important to him.

26:15.517 --> 26:17.117

26:54.887 --> 26:56.254
Marnie:
And so I've been strategizing

26:56.322 --> 26:57.588
about the best way
to spread the word

26:57.656 --> 26:59.323
about our various
home businesses

26:59.390 --> 27:01.625
and I have come up with this.

27:01.693 --> 27:02.626
Placemats.

27:02.694 --> 27:03.727
Women: (impressed) Wow.

27:03.795 --> 27:05.095
Yeah, I thought I'd talk
to Maggie

27:05.163 --> 27:06.730
about putting them on the tables
at the diner.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.098
Lou: Um... (Clears throat)

27:08.166 --> 27:09.567
I know I'm new,

27:09.634 --> 27:11.602
but I actually have this
little concept

27:11.670 --> 27:13.736
that I would like to share.

27:13.804 --> 27:15.304
Marnie, do you mind?

27:15.372 --> 27:16.339
Absolutely.

27:16.406 --> 27:17.674
Great.

27:17.741 --> 27:20.743
So, when I started
the Equestrian Connection

27:20.811 --> 27:22.378
I built this little website

27:22.446 --> 27:25.414
and it grew, and grew and...

27:25.483 --> 27:26.583
Well, I can show it to you.

27:26.650 --> 27:27.717
It's right here.

27:31.287 --> 27:33.188
Woman: Oh. It's beautiful.

27:33.255 --> 27:35.056
<i>Woman 2:</i> <i>Wow. That's so professional.</i>
<i>You did this yourself?</i>

27:35.124 --> 27:37.626
Yeah, and I thought WWAHH
could do something similar.

27:37.694 --> 27:39.761
You know,
just build a killer website

27:39.829 --> 27:41.897
and then link it up
to social networking sites

27:41.965 --> 27:44.099
like, um, Facebook, linkedin,

27:44.166 --> 27:45.700
even Twitter.

27:45.767 --> 27:48.068
And then obviously to all
your own websites as well,

27:48.136 --> 27:49.103
if you have them.

27:49.170 --> 27:51.105
That's fabulous. What is this?

27:51.172 --> 27:53.273
Just something
I was noodling with.

27:53.341 --> 27:57.778
POWER: Professional Organization
of Women Entrepreneurs Registry.

27:57.846 --> 27:59.514
I thought it packed
a little more punch.

<i>Woman 2:</i> <i>It's great.</i> <i>I love it.</i>

28:01.448 --> 28:03.249
New blood. It's always good.

28:03.317 --> 28:04.751
I've always wanted
to start my own website

28:04.819 --> 28:06.520
but I never knew how.

28:06.587 --> 28:07.754
Oh, it's really easy.

28:07.822 --> 28:08.922
I could show you
how to set it up.

28:08.990 --> 28:10.590
Great. What's your line of work?

28:10.658 --> 28:11.958
I'm a lawyer.

28:12.026 --> 28:13.159
I worked for a big company
in Calgary for years,

28:13.227 --> 28:14.561
but I've moved back to Hudson

28:14.629 --> 28:16.662
and hung up my own shingle
at home.

28:16.730 --> 28:18.831
I know that story.
Are you enjoying it?

28:18.899 --> 28:20.432
Yeah. I'm loving it.

28:20.500 --> 28:23.168
I'm gonna give you my card.

28:23.236 --> 28:24.136
Thank you. May I?

28:24.203 --> 28:25.270
Mm-hm.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.675
Amy: Caroline Hanley?

28:31.678 --> 28:32.777
Do you think they're related?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.512
I don't know.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.516
I'm gonna find out.

28:44.672 --> 28:46.072
(Doorbell dings)

28:49.410 --> 28:52.344
Hi. Caroline.
We've actually met.

28:52.412 --> 28:53.612
Can I help you?

28:53.680 --> 28:56.749
Are you Levon Hanley's sister?

28:57.984 --> 29:01.119
<i>...And now he's about</i>
<i>to lose his animals,</i>

29:01.187 --> 29:03.522
the farm, everything.

29:04.524 --> 29:06.725
Why are you telling me this?

29:06.793 --> 29:09.294
'Cause you're his sister.
It's a family farm.

29:09.361 --> 29:12.897
I just thought maybe
you'd wanna help if you knew.

29:12.964 --> 29:15.400
Let me explain something
to you.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.801
Levon and I...

29:17.736 --> 29:20.137
We haven't spoken for years.

29:20.205 --> 29:21.406
He's your brother.

29:21.473 --> 29:23.840
And as for the "family farm"?

29:23.908 --> 29:25.475
I have no connection to it
any more.

29:25.543 --> 29:28.578
I couldn't care less
what happens to it.

29:30.748 --> 29:32.184
(Scoffs)

29:32.248 --> 29:33.784
He needs your help.

29:33.851 --> 29:34.751
C-can't you just-

29:34.819 --> 29:36.219
if you'll excuse me.

29:36.287 --> 29:38.622
I have a lot of work to do.

29:42.726 --> 29:43.793
Certainly.

29:49.065 --> 29:50.132
Thanks.

29:52.135 --> 29:53.869
(Coffee splashes)

29:53.937 --> 29:55.137
Pretty good, huh?

29:55.205 --> 29:56.604
I've already had two calls
thanks to these.

29:56.672 --> 29:59.341
Yeah. Hey, we should get
some made with "POWER."

29:59.408 --> 30:01.443
I really think POWER
is better, don't you?

30:01.510 --> 30:03.878
We could take a vote on it
at the next meeting.

30:03.946 --> 30:05.046
Marnie.

30:05.113 --> 30:06.481
I have to thank you - May I?

30:06.549 --> 30:07.749
I have to thank you so much

30:07.817 --> 30:09.484
for introducing me
to your group.

30:09.552 --> 30:11.918
They've been so great!
So supportive.

30:11.986 --> 30:14.488
And they're totally sold
on my website idea.

30:14.556 --> 30:15.989
(Exhales)

30:16.057 --> 30:18.459
But hey, we are not here
to talk about business.

30:18.526 --> 30:20.093
Let's order something fattening

30:20.161 --> 30:22.128
<i>and talk about</i>
<i>the engagement party.</i>

30:22.196 --> 30:24.832
I've been thinking about it
and I have a lot of ideas.

30:24.899 --> 30:26.166
I'm sure you do.

30:26.234 --> 30:27.834
I actually have one, too.

30:27.901 --> 30:29.402
Great. Let's hear it.

30:29.470 --> 30:31.337
Find yourself
another maid of honour

30:31.405 --> 30:33.038
'cause I quit.

30:34.007 --> 30:36.509
(Footsteps stomp away,
diner door opens)

30:37.444 --> 30:38.678
(Horse snuffles)

30:39.613 --> 30:41.414
Amy: Mr. Hanley?

30:41.482 --> 30:43.916
Amy, what're you doing here?

30:43.984 --> 30:46.051
I spoke with your sister.

30:46.987 --> 30:48.053
Caroline?

30:49.856 --> 30:51.957
I thought maybe she could help.

30:52.025 --> 30:54.093
You shouldn't have bothered.

30:56.062 --> 30:59.231
You know...
I just don't get it.

30:59.299 --> 31:02.267
It's no wonder Caroline
won't speak to me.

31:02.334 --> 31:03.601
What do you mean?

31:03.668 --> 31:06.304
She hates me
for having this place.

31:06.372 --> 31:08.306
My dad left it for me, you see,
not her.

31:08.374 --> 31:10.341
She's the eldest.

31:11.277 --> 31:13.111
Sometimes I swear I can feel
my dad looking down,

31:13.178 --> 31:14.612
shaking his head,

31:14.679 --> 31:18.515
saying, "I shoulda left the farm
for Caroline after all."

31:18.582 --> 31:21.851
'Cause all I did
was botch it up.

31:22.787 --> 31:25.455
I let 'em all down, Amy.

31:26.724 --> 31:28.458
Didn't I, boy?

31:46.209 --> 31:48.743
I got some supplies.

31:48.811 --> 31:50.611
From Lou.

31:50.679 --> 31:52.247
Thanks.

31:52.315 --> 31:54.115
It's a little early
for that, isn't it?

31:54.183 --> 31:55.783
A celebration.

31:55.851 --> 31:59.087
Ashley just brought me back
from the doctor's office and...

31:59.155 --> 32:01.556
Well, the X-rays says
everything's healed up nicely.

32:01.623 --> 32:03.758
That's great news, man.

32:03.826 --> 32:07.227
Yeah. Be back on my feet
in a month or two.

32:07.295 --> 32:08.862
<i>Awesome.</i>

32:10.832 --> 32:12.166
So, uh...

32:12.633 --> 32:15.235
You sure everything's
all right?

32:15.303 --> 32:17.972
Yeah. Couldn't be better.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.115
Yeah, hi, Lise. It's me, again.

32:29.549 --> 32:31.550
Uh, call me back.

32:32.919 --> 32:34.287
She's avoiding your calls.

32:34.355 --> 32:36.388
Now why on earth
would she do that?

32:36.456 --> 32:38.056
Uh, she's jealous.

32:38.124 --> 32:39.491
Jealous? Of what?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.393
Of Val, duh!

32:41.461 --> 32:42.560
That is ridiculous.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.730
Lisa knows Val
and I are friends.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.099
Just friends.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.134
Jack, Jack, Jack, wake up!

32:49.202 --> 32:50.335
Ever since Lisa's been home,

32:50.403 --> 32:51.736
all she's seen is you with Val,

32:51.804 --> 32:53.704
you talking about Val,
Val working with Amy,

32:53.771 --> 32:55.139
Val staying for dinner,

32:55.207 --> 32:57.108
Val talking about
how awesome you are.

32:57.175 --> 32:59.843
How can you even think that?

32:59.911 --> 33:01.879
I don't think, I know!

33:01.946 --> 33:03.614
God, this family can be
so dense sometimes,

33:03.681 --> 33:06.450
you guys don't even see
what's right before your eyes!

33:06.518 --> 33:07.951
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Excuse me?</i>

33:08.019 --> 33:09.552
I've had just about enough
criticism for one day.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.287
Yeah, well,
that goes for you, too!

33:11.355 --> 33:12.555
Me?

33:12.623 --> 33:13.990
What're you talking about,
Mallory?

33:14.058 --> 33:16.659
See? You're oblivious
to the pain you're causing me.

33:16.727 --> 33:18.094
What pain?

33:18.162 --> 33:20.497
What do I have to do?
What do I have to say?

33:20.564 --> 33:22.899
I have been dying
for you to ask me

33:22.966 --> 33:24.099
to be one of your bridesmaids.

33:24.167 --> 33:25.467
<i>I've dropped</i> <i>a million clues,</i>

33:25.535 --> 33:28.003
and do you get a hint? No!

33:28.071 --> 33:29.271
I need a mental health day.

33:29.339 --> 33:32.074
This family is driving me crazy!

33:34.577 --> 33:36.145
(Front door opens)

33:37.313 --> 33:38.447
Lou: Mallory?

33:40.782 --> 33:42.216
Look, Mallory,

33:42.284 --> 33:44.952
can you let me explain?

33:45.020 --> 33:46.220
It didn't dawn on me to ask you

33:46.288 --> 33:47.922
to be a bridesmaid because...

33:47.989 --> 33:49.357
Because?

33:49.425 --> 33:51.792
I've always thought of you
more like a little sister.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.061
Like a flower girl.

33:53.128 --> 33:55.930
A flower girl?
Am I six years old?!

33:55.997 --> 33:58.998
(Half laughs)
No you're not six years old.

33:59.067 --> 34:02.001
Look, you've grown into
a wonderful young woman

34:02.070 --> 34:04.137
and a good friend

34:05.473 --> 34:07.174
and I would be honoured
if you would agree

34:07.241 --> 34:09.641
to be one of my bridesmaids.

34:09.710 --> 34:11.178
Offer accepted.

34:11.245 --> 34:12.978
Thank you.

34:13.045 --> 34:17.882
Now, as your bridesmaids,
can I make a suggestion?

34:17.951 --> 34:19.185
You should really make up
with Marnie,

34:19.252 --> 34:21.286
else your caterer
is out the window.

34:21.353 --> 34:23.054
How did you know about Marnie?

34:23.123 --> 34:25.458
Like I wouldn't know.

34:26.893 --> 34:30.027
Person on TV: Thank you! Thank you very much!
(Crowd cheers in background)

34:30.096 --> 34:31.262
(Knock at cabin door,
Caleb sighs, annoyed)

34:31.330 --> 34:32.830
<i>Ashley:</i> <i>Caleb? Are you there?</i>

34:32.898 --> 34:36.301
<i>Put your coat on</i>
<i>and get out here!</i>

34:37.803 --> 34:39.937
<i>Just a minute, Ash.</i>

34:41.974 --> 34:43.341
I have a surprise for you.

34:43.409 --> 34:44.641
Come here.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.277
I rode here
and I brought a friend.

34:49.581 --> 34:50.647
Ta-da!

34:53.518 --> 34:55.018
What's Shorty doing here?

34:55.085 --> 34:57.221
I thought you'd like
to see him.

34:57.288 --> 34:59.055
You think this is helpful?

34:59.124 --> 35:00.556
What?

35:00.690 --> 35:03.126
I might never rodeo again
and you shove it in my face!

35:03.193 --> 35:04.927
What are you talking about?

35:04.995 --> 35:06.862
The doctor said you'd be
good to go in a month.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.499
Yeah, sure,
the injuries might heal.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.601
I'm never gonna rodeo again.

35:11.668 --> 35:12.935
Yes, you will.

35:13.870 --> 35:15.605
<i>Of course you will.</i>

35:15.672 --> 35:18.440
Caleb...
I'm trying really hard here.

35:18.508 --> 35:20.242
The last few weeks
haven't been easy.

35:20.309 --> 35:22.644
You think they've been
easy on me? Huh?!

35:22.711 --> 35:25.380
You taking care of me,
being Little Miss Sunshine?

35:25.448 --> 35:26.714
Caleb, look.

35:26.782 --> 35:29.050
I know you're in a bad place
right now-

35:29.118 --> 35:30.519
Yeah, it's been great.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.353
Real easy to put up with.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.021
Especially since...

35:34.088 --> 35:35.556
Since what?

35:36.591 --> 35:38.459
Since it's your fault.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.627
My fault?!

35:39.694 --> 35:41.629
I told you not to come
to that rodeo.

35:41.696 --> 35:42.896
I told you
it was bad luck for me,

35:42.964 --> 35:44.465
and what do you do but show up.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.868
I showed up
because I care about you!

35:47.935 --> 35:49.435
<i>I can't believe this!</i>

35:49.503 --> 35:52.104
How dare you blame me
for that accident!

35:52.173 --> 35:54.440
You know, you're lucky
I was there.

35:54.508 --> 35:55.908
You know, who was the one
that stayed with you

35:55.976 --> 35:57.644
at the hospital day and night?

35:57.711 --> 35:58.778
Who held your hand?

35:58.845 --> 36:00.180
Who smuggled in food for you?

36:00.247 --> 36:01.614
I did everything for you!

36:01.682 --> 36:04.249
You know, I can't believe
how selfish

36:04.317 --> 36:07.052
and thoughtless you are!

36:07.119 --> 36:10.722
You don't get it...
And you never will.

36:10.790 --> 36:12.857
Let's just call it a day.

36:12.925 --> 36:15.060
Fine. You know what?

36:15.995 --> 36:17.462
You got it!

36:24.969 --> 36:26.704
<i>Amy:</i> <i>Caroline?</i>

36:27.906 --> 36:29.873
Look, I know you said
it didn't,

36:29.941 --> 36:33.010
but this place still means
a lot to you, doesn't it?

36:35.647 --> 36:38.781
Caroline:
It's all just bad memories.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.751
<i>Amy:</i> <i>They can't be all bad.</i>

36:41.819 --> 36:43.520
I mean, you keep coming back
here, don't ya?

36:43.588 --> 36:45.922
(Chuckles)

36:45.989 --> 36:48.658
We had fun here
when we were kids.

36:48.726 --> 36:50.527
We had the run of it.

36:54.864 --> 36:59.435
This place was supposed to be
given to you, wasn't it?

37:02.239 --> 37:03.305
Yeah.

37:04.407 --> 37:06.442
Dad knew I loved this place.

37:07.377 --> 37:08.643
He always said
it would be mine,

37:08.711 --> 37:10.511
but I was at law school
when he died

37:10.579 --> 37:11.946
and...

37:12.848 --> 37:16.217
Next thing I knew,
he'd given it all to Levon.

37:16.285 --> 37:19.019
I was the eldest,
I was the most responsible.

37:19.087 --> 37:21.822
He should have left it...
to me.

37:24.292 --> 37:26.593
But I was a girl...

37:26.661 --> 37:29.263
And a girl wasn't capable
of running a ranch.

37:31.432 --> 37:33.699
Great, huh? Now look at it.

37:33.768 --> 37:35.034
It's falling apart.

37:39.774 --> 37:41.607
It sounds like your fight
was never with your brother.

37:41.675 --> 37:43.476
It was with your dad.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.247
<i>Hanley:</i> <i>Amy?</i>

37:48.181 --> 37:49.248
Caroline?

37:55.321 --> 37:57.355
No, Caroline. Please, just...

37:58.291 --> 38:02.194
(Door slams shut,
ignition turns, engine revs)

38:06.799 --> 38:09.867
Just leave it be, Amy. Please.

38:10.903 --> 38:13.037
Don't get involved.

38:19.244 --> 38:21.344
I'm glad you came.

38:21.412 --> 38:23.079
Thanks for the invitation.

38:23.147 --> 38:25.215
It was unexpected.

38:29.053 --> 38:31.554
I know I haven't been
very attentive

38:31.622 --> 38:33.990
since you've been home.

38:34.058 --> 38:36.792
Well, you've had other things
on your mind.

38:36.860 --> 38:40.062
If by "things" you mean Val...

38:40.130 --> 38:42.264
Your words, not mine.

38:42.332 --> 38:43.799
Look, Lise...

38:45.001 --> 38:47.236
Val and I...

38:47.304 --> 38:49.972
We are just friends.
End of story.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.373
I know that. She knows that.

38:51.441 --> 38:53.574
Please.

38:53.642 --> 38:56.845
Val may know it,
but she doesn't accept it.

38:56.912 --> 38:58.279
Take it from me, Jack,

38:58.347 --> 39:00.281
as a fellow member
of the female persuasion,

39:00.349 --> 39:01.682
I know a lot more about
the inner workings

39:01.750 --> 39:03.184
of Val Stanton than you do.

39:03.252 --> 39:04.352
I don't think so.

39:04.419 --> 39:06.520
Oh, I do! (Huffs)

39:06.588 --> 39:08.255
I mean, look, you're entitled
to your friends,

39:08.323 --> 39:09.256
of course -

39:09.324 --> 39:10.891
Male or female.

39:10.959 --> 39:12.960
But if you don't know
what Val is up to,

39:13.027 --> 39:14.561
- then...
- Then what?

39:14.628 --> 39:15.863
Then you're naive.

39:15.930 --> 39:17.865
- Oh! I am not naive!
<i>- Yes, you are.</i>

39:17.932 --> 39:19.199
She's a vulture, Jack.

39:19.267 --> 39:21.268
She's just waiting
to swoop down

39:21.336 --> 39:24.703
at the first sign that
whatever we have is roadkill.

39:24.771 --> 39:26.638
Roadkill?
What're you talking...

39:26.706 --> 39:30.076
- Roadkill?
- It feels to me like, since I got back,

39:30.143 --> 39:32.245
whatever it is
that's going on between us

39:32.312 --> 39:34.580
could just go splat
at any moment.

39:34.647 --> 39:35.647
Splat?

39:35.715 --> 39:38.117
Roadkill splat! Splat!

39:39.152 --> 39:42.120
You realize that
in two years...

39:42.188 --> 39:46.157
Not one thing has changed
about our relationship?

39:46.225 --> 39:47.626
Think there's a reason
for that?

39:47.694 --> 39:49.361
Well, of course
there's a reason foe that!

39:49.429 --> 39:51.997
It's fine the way it is.

39:53.032 --> 39:55.967
(Sighs heavily)

39:56.035 --> 39:59.404
Well, okay...
Maybe it's fine for you.

40:00.338 --> 40:02.072
And not for you?

40:02.140 --> 40:03.408
Face facts.

40:04.342 --> 40:06.878
Just admit it, Jack,

40:06.945 --> 40:08.413
you're not committed to me.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.481
Oh, I damn well am
committed to you!

40:10.549 --> 40:12.449
Well, I haven't seen
a lot of proof of that lately!

40:12.517 --> 40:13.950
You want proof?
You want proof?!

40:14.018 --> 40:16.420
Then marry me, dammit!

40:25.235 --> 40:28.604
I totally overstepped
my bounds with WWAHH, Marnie.

40:28.671 --> 40:30.739
It's your group,
you created it,

40:30.806 --> 40:32.541
you're the leader.

40:32.609 --> 40:34.242
Yeah, I am.

40:34.309 --> 40:38.279
And I promise that
I'll back right off.

40:38.347 --> 40:40.248
I'm truly sorry.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.484
Apology accepted.

40:46.888 --> 40:48.756
Did you find another
maid of honour?

40:48.823 --> 40:49.956
No, not yet.

40:50.891 --> 40:52.058
But don't worry,

40:52.126 --> 40:54.060
you're still excused
from the job.

40:54.128 --> 40:55.595
(Laughs)

40:55.663 --> 40:57.531
Just please...

40:57.598 --> 41:01.168
Please tell me
you'll still cater my wedding.

41:01.235 --> 41:05.371
Oh my God,
I know I'm gonna regret this.

41:05.438 --> 41:06.505
Nice.

41:16.650 --> 41:19.385
(Horse grunts)

41:19.452 --> 41:22.687
(Gate rattles,
Caleb grunts on impact)

41:24.523 --> 41:26.324
(Pill bottle rattles)

41:30.028 --> 41:31.262
(Beer swishes)

41:41.138 --> 41:45.375
(Hooves clop, horse whinnies,
vehicle engine rumbles)

41:46.411 --> 41:50.146
Officer Wharton:
All right, let's see here.

41:54.251 --> 41:56.085
Hi.

41:56.152 --> 41:57.953
I, um...

41:58.021 --> 41:59.689
I thought about what you said -

41:59.756 --> 42:02.525
About my fight being with my dad
and not Levon -

42:02.593 --> 42:04.727
And you were right.

42:13.502 --> 42:17.038
I don't want us lose
the family farm.

42:17.106 --> 42:19.107
And I...

42:20.042 --> 42:21.776
I don't wanna lose you.

42:21.844 --> 42:24.846
- Caroline...
- I'm gonna help you out.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.057
Hi. I'm Caroline Hanley.

42:37.992 --> 42:39.126
Barb Wharton.

42:39.193 --> 42:40.794
Nice to meet you.
I'm Levon's sister,

42:40.862 --> 42:43.296
<i>and I'm gonna make sure that</i>
<i>these horses are taken care of.</i>

42:43.364 --> 42:44.964
Well, if these horses
are gonna to stay,

42:45.031 --> 42:46.132
I'm gonna need to see
proof of that.

42:46.199 --> 42:48.000
Yeah. Of course.

42:48.068 --> 42:49.769
I have a good practice in town

42:49.836 --> 42:51.571
<i>and...</i>

42:51.639 --> 42:55.207
I've just made arrangments
with Levon's bank manager.

42:55.276 --> 42:57.276
(Clears throat)
Here's a letter from him.

43:02.014 --> 43:03.448
Well, looks good to me.

43:03.516 --> 43:05.450
I'm gonna have to make
a call, first.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.974
Turns out I'm a bigger

You know, if you'll have me,

43:39.417 --> 43:42.319

43:46.589 --> 43:50.426
I mean, only a sister

43:52.629 --> 43:54.796
But I get to pick the dress.

43:55.731 --> 43:56.865
Okay.

43:56.933 --> 43:58.733

About getting married?

44:15.951 --> 44:17.417
Were you serious?

44:19.687 --> 44:21.322
