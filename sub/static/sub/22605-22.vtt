00:35.495 --> 00:37.263
I'm here to save your life.

00:37.264 --> 00:40.600
What life?

00:40.601 --> 00:42.535
Letters from your kids.

00:42.536 --> 00:44.437
When they're old enough to write 'em.

00:44.438 --> 00:47.673
We could even put
visitation on the table.

00:47.674 --> 00:50.209
I don't quite know how that would work.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.844
Congratulations.

00:51.845 --> 00:54.514
The architect of peace with Iran.

00:54.515 --> 00:56.682
You've made the world
a more dangerous place.

00:56.683 --> 00:59.218
Now they're free to build
a nuclear arsenal.

00:59.219 --> 01:02.121
I was at Lily's birthday party.

01:02.122 --> 01:04.924
Gosh, she's such a sweet kid.

01:04.925 --> 01:08.261
You know, she still sets a place for you

01:08.262 --> 01:09.333
at the table every day.

01:09.334 --> 01:11.497
I thought you were morally
opposed to torture.

01:11.498 --> 01:13.966
- People change.
- What do you want?

01:13.967 --> 01:16.336
I need to know if there are
any other rogue agents

01:16.337 --> 01:17.738
that we missed.

01:17.739 --> 01:20.908
And I want you to look me in the
eye and tell me about George.

01:20.909 --> 01:23.275
You killed George.

01:23.977 --> 01:25.579
You really want to pull this string?

01:25.580 --> 01:27.514
I can put you at the
center of all of it.

01:27.515 --> 01:29.249
I can give you the
calculus where all roads

01:29.250 --> 01:31.552
lead to you and a single decision.

01:31.553 --> 01:32.920
What decision is that?

01:32.921 --> 01:34.721
You could be sitting
in this chair if you'd

01:34.722 --> 01:36.223
actually lived through the war

01:36.224 --> 01:37.624
instead of retreating into academia.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.359
You turned on everyone

01:39.360 --> 01:42.062
and everything you
claimed to care about.

01:42.063 --> 01:43.196
You put this in action.

01:43.197 --> 01:44.398
You're the traitor.

01:44.399 --> 01:46.266
- What decision?
- You...

01:46.267 --> 01:48.234
quit.

02:01.782 --> 02:05.752
That does not look like
the stride of pride.

02:05.753 --> 02:08.221
More like the long walk to the woodshed.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.723
Conrad wants to see me.

02:10.725 --> 02:13.126
He read my Baghdad station report.

02:13.127 --> 02:15.495
I didn't get to it. What's the story?

02:15.496 --> 02:17.864
Scaling back on enhanced
interrogation tactics.

02:17.865 --> 02:21.702
Basic diatribe against
the efficacy of torture.

02:21.703 --> 02:23.203
Not to mention the morality.

02:23.204 --> 02:26.391
- I'm sure you covered that.
- Oh, well, you know.

02:26.392 --> 02:28.660
The odd bit of harping on
the Geneva convention.

02:28.661 --> 02:30.128
Which'll have to do until I can produce

02:30.129 --> 02:32.764
- the hard science on karma.
- The White House is calling

02:32.765 --> 02:34.699
the Geneva convention quaint.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.367
Their argument is these aren't

02:36.368 --> 02:37.869
your father's prisoners of war.

02:37.870 --> 02:39.804
(laughs)

02:39.805 --> 02:41.773
We didn't change the rules, they did.

02:41.774 --> 02:43.174
But then what's the answer?

02:43.175 --> 02:45.548
Betraying our own standards
of ethical behavior?

02:45.549 --> 02:47.912
I'm just reporting your
commander in chief's position.

02:47.913 --> 02:50.481
In no way am I saying
we back off this fight.

02:50.482 --> 02:53.351
The image of those planes
crashing into the towers

02:53.352 --> 02:55.753
plays on a loop in my head.

02:55.754 --> 02:58.189
But my argument is that

02:58.190 --> 03:01.025
torture is a waste of time.

03:01.026 --> 03:04.095
We are squandering valuable resources

03:04.096 --> 03:05.363
for little or no return on investment.

03:05.364 --> 03:07.432
I get it. It's complicated.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.734
What do you hear from Isabelle?

03:09.735 --> 03:11.336
- Miserable in London.
- What?

03:11.337 --> 03:14.172
She says it never stops
raining, the food is terrible

03:14.173 --> 03:17.075
and the guys in MI6 don't get her jokes.

03:17.076 --> 03:18.943
<i>We</i> don't get her jokes.

03:18.944 --> 03:20.878
I didn't tell her that.

03:20.879 --> 03:22.580
Oh, well.

03:22.581 --> 03:25.183
I'm about to get fired or
put on the Latvia desk.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.719
Al-Qaeda will have to remain
in your capable hands.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.953
Good luck.

03:35.059 --> 03:36.426
(bell dings)

03:38.663 --> 03:40.665
Ah. My staff.

03:40.666 --> 03:42.100
And video footage.

03:42.101 --> 03:43.568
I have a bad feeling.

03:43.569 --> 03:45.670
- No, it could be nothing.
- It's not nothing.

03:45.671 --> 03:47.171
It's not entirely something. Yet.

03:47.172 --> 03:49.507
Okay. Let's see it.

03:49.508 --> 03:51.409
Senator Raymond Caruthers,

03:51.410 --> 03:54.712
staunch opponent of everything
in this administration,

03:54.713 --> 03:56.748
has cottoned on to the
recent events in Iran,

03:56.749 --> 03:58.516
holding himself up

03:58.517 --> 04:00.837
- as the defender of truth.
- CARUTHERS: I have not been placated

04:00.838 --> 04:02.787
by the president's
charade of transparency

04:02.788 --> 04:04.655
regarding the events in Iran.

04:04.656 --> 04:05.990
We're supposed to accept that

04:05.991 --> 04:07.859
the responsible parties have been caught

04:07.860 --> 04:09.627
and are on their way to justice.
I'm not resting easy

04:09.628 --> 04:11.028
with that and neither should

04:11.029 --> 04:12.797
- the American people.
- ELIZABETH: A guy who's making a bid

04:12.798 --> 04:15.833
for president using the coup in
Iran for grandstanding purposes?

04:15.834 --> 04:17.502
There's nothing to be exposed.

04:17.503 --> 04:18.803
It still needs to be handled.

04:18.803 --> 04:20.471
Conspiracies can snowball.

04:20.471 --> 04:23.307
There's no conspiracy
except the one we thwarted.

04:23.308 --> 04:25.009
I'm just saying if that gets traction,

04:25.010 --> 04:27.078
you're gonna be spending
way too much time

04:27.079 --> 04:28.713
talking the people off the ledge.

04:28.714 --> 04:31.082
Well, we'll cross that
ledge when we get to it.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.818
Uh, Madam Secretary... I just
got word that Senator Caruthers

04:33.819 --> 04:35.486
is on his way to your office.

04:35.487 --> 04:36.854
I told him you weren't available.

04:36.855 --> 04:38.588
He doesn't seem to care.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.092
This is not the ledge.

04:41.093 --> 04:43.928
This is a thing before
you get to the ledge,

04:43.929 --> 04:46.497
which is still a long
way from the ground.

04:46.498 --> 04:48.933
I'm officially retiring this metaphor.

04:48.934 --> 04:51.034
Thanks, Blake.

04:51.969 --> 04:53.905
Secretary of State saw this.

04:53.906 --> 04:55.907
Secretary of Defense saw this.

04:55.908 --> 04:58.943
National Security Advisor,
White House Chief of Staff

04:58.944 --> 05:01.012
- and the President saw this.
- I'm so sorry, sir.

05:01.013 --> 05:02.246
I don't know how that happened.

05:02.247 --> 05:05.283
Because I showed it to them.

05:05.284 --> 05:07.051
Why?

05:07.052 --> 05:09.720
I thought you made some valid points.

05:09.721 --> 05:11.222
What did they think?

05:11.223 --> 05:13.291
They remain unpersuaded.

05:13.292 --> 05:15.693
- (sighs)
- I want you to rewrite the report,

05:15.694 --> 05:18.029
putting the focus on increased
human Intel on the ground

05:18.030 --> 05:20.364
and other strategies to replace
enhanced interrogation.

05:20.365 --> 05:22.800
- Okay. - Show them they can
win this war without it.

05:22.801 --> 05:24.101
- (sighing): Okay.
- I'm gonna

05:24.102 --> 05:25.903
use that to explain why
I'm appointing you

05:25.904 --> 05:27.505
station chief in Baghdad.

05:27.506 --> 05:28.606
What?!

05:28.607 --> 05:30.441
I have to replace Mike Hirst.

05:30.442 --> 05:32.443
He's ineffective and controversial...

05:32.444 --> 05:35.580
worst possible combination.

05:35.581 --> 05:38.616
I have to show the White House
that we have a clear directive.

05:38.617 --> 05:40.818
Who better to enforce that
directive than the person who

05:40.819 --> 05:42.620
- authored it?
- I'm not an operative, sir.

05:42.621 --> 05:43.921
Neither is the station chief.

05:43.922 --> 05:45.256
It's an administrative position.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.125
You are the only person I trust
to keep the operation in Iraq

05:48.126 --> 05:51.429
effective and legitimate.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.396
Together we can win this.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.835
And hold our heads high.

05:57.836 --> 05:59.603
I know you won't let me down.

06:01.005 --> 06:04.775
- Madam Secretary.
- Madam Secretary, Senator Caruthers.

06:04.776 --> 06:07.645
Welcome. Can, uh, Blake get you...

06:07.646 --> 06:09.413
Oh. Well...

06:09.414 --> 06:11.549
Blake doesn't seem interested
in getting you anything.

06:11.550 --> 06:14.252
Madam Secretary, I'm sure
you're aware of the confusion

06:14.253 --> 06:16.287
and unease that's been
swirling in the wake

06:16.288 --> 06:18.523
of Director Munsey's acts of treason.

06:18.524 --> 06:20.925
Senator, it's just the two
of us... no cameras in here...

06:20.926 --> 06:22.760
so, short and sweet'll do it.

06:22.761 --> 06:26.197
Fine.

06:26.198 --> 06:29.467
Here's the subpoena.

06:29.468 --> 06:30.968
Subpoena for what?

06:30.969 --> 06:32.603
To appear before a senate

06:32.604 --> 06:35.139
investigation committee looking
into this administration's

06:35.140 --> 06:36.741
involvement in the attempt to overthrow

06:36.742 --> 06:38.209
the government in Iran.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.878
Hm.

06:40.879 --> 06:44.248
Well, you don't often see
a senator hand-delivering

06:44.249 --> 06:46.317
a subpoena. Nice personal touch.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.085
You can be as dismissive as you like now...

06:48.086 --> 06:50.521
Can I take a wild stab at
who's chairing this committee?

06:50.522 --> 06:52.657
...but you will stand
before that committee

06:52.658 --> 06:54.792
- and you will tell the truth.
- Not a problem.

06:54.793 --> 06:56.594
Do it all the time. But senator...

06:56.595 --> 06:59.564
may I ask? You ever get a queasy

06:59.565 --> 07:02.600
3:00 a.m. feeling about wasting

07:02.601 --> 07:05.169
the taxpayers' money on this
kind of public display,

07:05.170 --> 07:06.537
which is really about

07:06.538 --> 07:09.807
promoting your own
political ambitions? Ever?

07:09.808 --> 07:12.777
I'll see you soon, Madam Secretary.

07:12.778 --> 07:15.145
And I'll be the one
asking the questions.

07:19.717 --> 07:21.319
Can I get you anything?

07:21.320 --> 07:24.388
(chuckles) So many ways to go with that.

07:24.389 --> 07:27.524
What do you think he thinks he has?

07:30.261 --> 07:32.562
I have no idea. (wry laugh)

07:34.831 --> 07:42.271
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.208
(chuckles)

07:51.209 --> 07:52.476
(door opens, dog barks)

07:52.477 --> 07:54.544
Mike B without an appointment
or heads-up of any...

07:54.545 --> 07:56.146
- kind.
- A subpoena?

07:56.147 --> 07:57.714
Really? I have to find this out

07:57.715 --> 07:59.216
on the elliptical machine at my gym?

07:59.217 --> 08:01.418
I don't get that machine.

08:01.419 --> 08:03.720
I always feel like I'm
falling through space.

08:03.721 --> 08:06.123
Okay, this is serious.
Seriously disruptive.

08:06.124 --> 08:07.390
They can't have anything.

08:07.391 --> 08:09.726
- Would you tell your daddy to calm down?
- Even he knows

08:09.727 --> 08:11.394
if they have a subpoena,
they have something.

08:11.395 --> 08:12.963
They don't give those
away free with purchase.

08:12.964 --> 08:15.232
President went on national
television and came

08:15.233 --> 08:17.801
clean with the world... full transparency.

08:17.802 --> 08:19.569
There's nothing left to know.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.071
Oh, thank God. 'Cause I'm sure

08:21.072 --> 08:22.439
they're actually after the truth.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.574
I'm sure they wouldn't find some

08:24.575 --> 08:27.577
nugget of discrepancy and
firestorm it into grounds

08:27.578 --> 08:29.079
for impeachment. That never happens.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.047
Do you know that Raymond
Caruthers was president

08:31.048 --> 08:33.183
- of the Princeton Debating Society?
- No, tell me more.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.051
- It's on his Facebook page.
- And do you understand

08:35.052 --> 08:37.020
that great debaters win
not because they have

08:37.020 --> 08:39.589
the best argument but because
they are the best arguer?

08:39.590 --> 08:42.092
- He's a dangerous man.
- It's theater.

08:42.092 --> 08:43.994
The administration has a black eye,

08:43.995 --> 08:46.763
he just wants to rub
some salt in the wound.

08:46.764 --> 08:47.998
See? You're mixing metaphors.

08:47.999 --> 08:50.233
He's not gonna do that.

08:50.234 --> 08:52.269
Well, I have been thinking
about it, you know.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.137
In fact, I've been making a list.

08:54.138 --> 08:57.707
And I did slip my detail
in order to interrogate

08:57.708 --> 08:59.709
the fueler who sabotaged Marsh's plane.

08:59.710 --> 09:03.146
And I did jimmy up a
state visit to Venezuela

09:03.147 --> 09:04.881
in order to uncover
a secret bank account.

09:04.882 --> 09:06.416
I did plenty

09:06.417 --> 09:07.417
of unconventional things,

09:07.418 --> 09:08.919
but none of it was illegal.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.488
- You need a lawyer.
- I don't want a lawyer.

09:11.489 --> 09:12.956
It makes me look like I need a lawyer.

09:12.957 --> 09:15.058
At the very least, give me
permission to transgress

09:15.059 --> 09:16.826
some boundaries to find
out what they know.

09:16.827 --> 09:19.563
- Haven't you done that already?
- Of course I have. My feelers are out.

09:19.564 --> 09:23.166
- Then we're up to speed.
- All right. Think about the lawyer.

09:23.167 --> 09:24.768
Gordon, let's go.

09:24.769 --> 09:28.605
BLAKE: Madam Secretary,
Daisy actually called ahead

09:28.606 --> 09:30.507
and asked to see you at this time.

09:30.508 --> 09:32.175
DAISY: Ma'am, a small

09:32.176 --> 09:34.611
but significant matter has come up.

09:34.612 --> 09:36.112
We've received a portrait
of James Madison

09:36.113 --> 09:38.048
to replace the portrait of Vincent Marsh.

09:38.049 --> 09:39.149
Given the revelations about

09:39.150 --> 09:40.951
the late secretary and his connection

09:40.952 --> 09:42.252
to the coup in Iran, and given that

09:42.253 --> 09:43.587
the press comes through
here all the time...

09:43.588 --> 09:45.722
I know, I know... the optics aren't good.

09:45.723 --> 09:47.991
I have my hands full with
the senate investigation,

09:47.992 --> 09:50.727
but with your permission, I'd
like to delegate this to Blake.

09:50.728 --> 09:52.495
I mean, it's mostly making phone calls

09:52.496 --> 09:55.098
to the archives and museums
till we find a good fit.

09:55.099 --> 09:57.000
- Are you good with this?
- Uh, yes, uh, anything to help, ma'am.

09:57.001 --> 09:59.202
So you will make this portrait disappear

09:59.203 --> 10:00.937
and I don't have to think about it?

10:00.938 --> 10:02.405
Yes, ma'am. And then I'd like to perform

10:02.406 --> 10:04.340
a similar magic on Mike B.

10:05.609 --> 10:08.510
I apologize if that was inappropriate.

10:09.546 --> 10:11.814
Thank you both.

10:16.886 --> 10:18.188
Who's winning?

10:18.189 --> 10:20.323
It's too close to call.

10:20.324 --> 10:22.926
I hate to sound like the
tech-spoiled millennial,

10:22.927 --> 10:24.928
but couldn't we get a copier from

10:24.929 --> 10:26.329
this century that actually works?

10:26.330 --> 10:27.931
According to our budget, no.

10:27.932 --> 10:29.933
We're one step up

10:29.934 --> 10:31.968
from scrolling monks.

10:31.969 --> 10:33.670
It's kind of ironic that we send money

10:33.671 --> 10:35.138
to people in developing nations

10:35.139 --> 10:37.874
- and yet... - This is the tip of
the irony iceberg around here.

10:37.875 --> 10:41.611
The glamorous world of public service.

10:41.612 --> 10:44.848
Kind of sexy... a guy
in stained work clothes.

10:44.849 --> 10:47.384
- Very DH Lawrence.
- Okay,

10:47.385 --> 10:49.651
don't flirt with me.

10:52.455 --> 10:53.923
I'm not.

10:53.924 --> 10:55.525
You are.

10:55.526 --> 10:57.827
It's cruel to flirt with
someone you just dumped.

10:57.828 --> 11:00.363
I did not dump you. I...

11:00.364 --> 11:02.432
made the responsible choice

11:02.433 --> 11:05.669
and chose not to continue
the relationship.

11:05.670 --> 11:07.837
Okay.

11:07.838 --> 11:11.007
Well, it's cruel to flirt
with someone after that.

11:11.008 --> 11:12.976
Look, I'm just asking, just,

11:12.977 --> 11:16.112
could you hide behind a
mask of professionalism?

11:16.113 --> 11:18.914
Like I'm doing.

11:22.419 --> 11:24.720
It's all yours.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.065
HENRY: <i>Okay, listen, guys,
this Senate investigation</i>

11:35.066 --> 11:36.366
is gonna be a big deal.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.034
Now, there's nothing there,

11:38.035 --> 11:39.803
so we have nothing to worry about.

11:39.804 --> 11:42.505
But it's gonna be noisy, and
it's gonna be in your face,

11:42.506 --> 11:43.707
and it could go on for quite a while.

11:43.708 --> 11:44.741
Bigger than the Microloans thing?

11:44.742 --> 11:46.509
- Well, afraid so, Noodle.
- JASON: Okay.

11:46.510 --> 11:48.912
Is there some sort of silver
lining we're not seeing here?

11:48.913 --> 11:50.313
Conflict builds character?

11:50.314 --> 11:51.681
ALISON: It's not funny, Mom.

11:51.682 --> 11:55.618
Look, the president and I came
out on top after the coup.

11:55.619 --> 11:57.620
There's a small but
loud faction of people

11:57.621 --> 12:00.123
who want to tear us down.
That's all it is.

12:00.124 --> 12:01.524
We'll get through it.

12:01.525 --> 12:03.426
Okay, since this is a family
meeting, don't we get to take

12:03.427 --> 12:04.894
- a vote?
- Uh...

12:04.895 --> 12:06.062
Okay, who's officially over Mom's job?

12:06.063 --> 12:07.263
- Guys.
- I am.

12:07.264 --> 12:08.398
Cut it out.

12:08.399 --> 12:09.933
- What?
- We got a vote on her taking the job.

12:09.934 --> 12:12.369
- Yeah, we all made a commitment.
- ALISON: That was before we knew

12:12.370 --> 12:14.104
how much it would suck. Now we know.

12:14.105 --> 12:15.372
We made a commitment as a family.

12:15.373 --> 12:17.640
(overlapping argument)

12:17.641 --> 12:20.410
- (whistles)
- ELIZABETH: Guys...

12:20.411 --> 12:21.911
quitting the job is not on the table.

12:21.912 --> 12:24.147
We just wanted to give you a
heads-up on how much it's going

12:24.148 --> 12:26.249
to suck, and to reassure
you that it's gonna be okay.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.251
I have nothing to hide.

12:28.252 --> 12:30.086
Questions?

12:30.087 --> 12:32.222
Yeah. When can you quit the job?

12:32.223 --> 12:33.623
Are you kidding?

12:33.624 --> 12:35.258
Come on, solidarity, guys.

12:35.259 --> 12:37.460
What happened to "Go team McCord"?

12:37.461 --> 12:38.595
(ding)

12:38.596 --> 12:39.896
Do we really need to care

12:39.897 --> 12:41.598
what our teenagers think about my job?

12:41.599 --> 12:42.766
(Henry laughs)

12:42.767 --> 12:44.968
Well, I was the son of a union leader.

12:44.969 --> 12:47.504
I got rocks thrown at me
because of my dad's job.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.806
You know what? This week, they hate us.

12:49.807 --> 12:51.875
Next week, if we could get box seats

12:51.876 --> 12:53.910
to a Nationals game,
they'd be over the moon.

12:53.911 --> 12:55.278
We never go full bore on the perks.

12:55.279 --> 12:57.547
We should absolutely get
box seats to the Nationals.

12:57.548 --> 12:59.416
Well, I-I've been saying since day one.

12:59.417 --> 13:02.819
How nice was it to hear Stevie
be supportive of her mother?

13:02.820 --> 13:05.221
Whom she no longer hates, apparently.

13:05.222 --> 13:07.524
As predicted by someone on Team McCord.

13:07.525 --> 13:10.427
Okay, reel it in, Captain.

13:10.428 --> 13:12.262
You were right.

13:12.263 --> 13:15.865
She also seems to like you
okay, so, we both win.

13:15.866 --> 13:18.635
- Now the other two are mad at us.
- It doesn't matter.

13:18.636 --> 13:21.438
Those two we can still
threaten with military school.

13:21.439 --> 13:25.173
(laughs) - I love you and your
sensible parenting style.

13:28.211 --> 13:31.648
HENRY: <i>Station Chief?</i>

13:31.649 --> 13:33.149
Babe, that's an enormous job.

13:33.150 --> 13:34.451
ELIZABETH: Yeah.

13:34.452 --> 13:36.019
I know.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.487
Living in Baghdad?

13:37.488 --> 13:38.855
Wow. For how long?

13:38.856 --> 13:40.423
Well, I mean,

13:40.424 --> 13:42.725
I'd probably have to put in

13:42.726 --> 13:44.993
at least a year to be effective.

13:45.895 --> 13:48.196
A year away from us?

13:49.332 --> 13:53.002
Conrad is putting a lot of
responsibility on my shoulders.

13:53.003 --> 13:56.005
I would be running the
interrogation operations.

13:56.006 --> 13:57.674
Making sure they're done effectively

13:57.675 --> 13:59.175
without crossing any lines,

13:59.176 --> 14:02.545
which will keep us far and
away from the slippery slope.

14:02.546 --> 14:04.180
Yeah, I understand the job.

14:04.181 --> 14:06.115
I... Why does it have to be you?

14:06.116 --> 14:09.419
Because I wrote the proposal

14:09.420 --> 14:12.455
asking the White House
to reconsider their policy.

14:12.456 --> 14:14.090
Yeah, you're also the person

14:14.091 --> 14:16.459
who insisted on having
a desk job at Langley

14:16.460 --> 14:18.228
so you could be with your family.

14:18.229 --> 14:20.196
Yeah, well, then the world changed.

14:20.197 --> 14:21.898
Four years.

14:21.899 --> 14:23.366
9/11 was just a bad day,

14:23.367 --> 14:25.134
and already, we're starting to forget?

14:25.135 --> 14:27.770
I served in combat in Iraq.
I'm not forgetting anything.

14:27.771 --> 14:29.138
And, yeah,

14:29.139 --> 14:30.907
people are recovering.
There's nothing wrong with that.

14:30.908 --> 14:32.108
Let tell you something, Henry.

14:32.109 --> 14:33.309
There are a lot of people

14:33.310 --> 14:35.578
doing what I do, so
that they can recover.

14:35.579 --> 14:37.680
They have the luxury of forgetting

14:37.681 --> 14:39.682
- because we refuse to.
- No one is forgetting.

14:39.683 --> 14:41.217
- That's not what it feels like.
- I am talking about...

14:41.218 --> 14:43.019
- Shh!
- ...our marriage and our children.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.722
And I am talking about a higher
purpose which serves them.

14:45.723 --> 14:47.223
You went off to war
when we were newlyweds.

14:47.224 --> 14:48.391
You married a Marine.

14:48.392 --> 14:50.460
- You married a spy.
- With a desk job.

14:50.461 --> 14:52.996
- I'll have a desk in Baghdad.
- Don't do that. Don't...

14:52.997 --> 14:54.697
No, I'm saying, it's not like
I'm going into the field.

14:54.698 --> 14:56.099
I will go to great lengths

14:56.100 --> 14:57.734
to explain that to Stevie and Alison.

14:57.735 --> 14:59.302
Jason won't even remember
you if you go...

14:59.303 --> 15:01.471
We have to stop.

15:01.472 --> 15:04.339
(sighs)

15:05.808 --> 15:08.177
Uh, excuse me.

15:08.178 --> 15:11.180
A moment to discuss the
Vincent Marsh of it all?

15:11.181 --> 15:12.148
Sure.

15:12.149 --> 15:14.217
- All right.
- Thank you.

15:14.218 --> 15:18.654
Okay, this is a very hard
thing for me to say.

15:19.455 --> 15:21.224
I've hit a wall.

15:21.225 --> 15:23.993
Can we hang the portrait on it?

15:23.994 --> 15:26.129
A wall that has obliterated
my sense of humor.

15:26.130 --> 15:27.497
What-What's the status?

15:27.498 --> 15:29.331
I've tried everything.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.335
- DAISY: National Portrait Gallery?
- MATT: The Library of Congress?

15:32.336 --> 15:33.703
- The Frick?
- MATT: How about the State House

15:33.704 --> 15:35.104
in Illinois? He served there once.

15:35.105 --> 15:36.339
In the General Assembly.

15:36.340 --> 15:37.640
"I've tried everything,"

15:37.641 --> 15:39.776
is not a sentence I use lightly.

15:39.777 --> 15:42.278
Lest you intend to keep
saying names of museums.

15:42.279 --> 15:45.114
Isn't there a Benedict Arnold
Hall of Traitors somewhere?

15:45.115 --> 15:46.616
(laughing): If there's not, why not?

15:46.617 --> 15:48.318
See me not laughing?

15:48.319 --> 15:51.054
Okay, maybe it's time to go to Nadine.

15:51.055 --> 15:53.723
Every time I look at my
watch, it's not that time.

15:53.724 --> 15:55.825
She makes fun of him in staff meetings.

15:55.826 --> 15:57.694
I mean, I don't think she's
that sensitive about it anymore.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.563
Well, I would prefer not to
find out in exactly this way.

16:00.564 --> 16:03.533
Or perhaps you would like to ask her?

16:03.534 --> 16:05.067
You?

16:06.936 --> 16:09.205
Uh, just keep digging.
You'll find something.

16:09.206 --> 16:11.874
- Yeah.
- MIKE: <i>So, what do you think it means</i>

16:11.875 --> 16:14.010
that Russell Jackson is
coming to your office?

16:14.011 --> 16:16.012
I think it means it's a weekday

16:16.013 --> 16:17.614
during business hours.

16:17.615 --> 16:20.416
He said it was about
the Senate investigation.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.118
Where's Gordon?

16:22.119 --> 16:24.153
He's with my ex-wife.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.623
We share custody.

16:26.624 --> 16:28.558
It's actually a painful subject.

16:28.559 --> 16:30.326
I'm sorry.

16:30.327 --> 16:33.062
I didn't know you felt pain.

16:33.063 --> 16:34.931
Ma'am, Mr. Jackson is
uncharacteristically here

16:34.932 --> 16:36.232
at an appointed time.

16:36.233 --> 16:37.834
Oh, thank you, Blake.

16:37.835 --> 16:39.002
Russell, you know Mike B?

16:39.003 --> 16:40.737
Only by reputation.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.805
I'll try not to gush. I'm a
big admirer of your work.

16:42.806 --> 16:44.207
Oh, I keep track of you, as well.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.908
That Canuck letter you
laid on Senator Demunzio?

16:45.909 --> 16:47.944
- That was inspired.
- That means a lot coming from you.

16:47.945 --> 16:49.245
And I never get credit for that.

16:49.246 --> 16:51.247
Well, Demunzio never ran
for another term after that.

16:51.248 --> 16:53.149
It's the little victories
that keep you going.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.951
That was not so little.

16:54.952 --> 16:56.285
You're right. I'm being
falsely modest, yeah.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.287
You guys need some time alone, or...?

16:58.288 --> 17:00.323
I'm good.

17:00.324 --> 17:02.358
Down to business.

17:02.359 --> 17:04.527
First an update on Juliet.

17:04.528 --> 17:07.063
She's refusing to
cooperate with the FBI,

17:07.064 --> 17:10.599
so, DOJ is definitely
seeking the death penalty,

17:10.601 --> 17:11.934
- and they're gonna fast-track it.
- Yes.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.301
Regarding your situation,

17:13.303 --> 17:14.671
good news.

17:14.672 --> 17:17.205
White House Counsel has
made a legal determination,

17:17.207 --> 17:19.809
and they're going to
invoke executive privilege

17:19.810 --> 17:23.713
in response to the subpoena, so,
you're off the hook... for now.

17:23.714 --> 17:26.315
Fantastic.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.252
This is the part where you
say, "Thank you, Russell,

17:29.253 --> 17:30.420
for your topnotch voodoo."

17:30.421 --> 17:31.721
Of course I mean prowess.

17:31.722 --> 17:33.456
I hate the way this looks.

17:33.457 --> 17:34.824
It looks like Christmas morning.

17:34.825 --> 17:36.192
It looks like I'm hiding

17:36.193 --> 17:37.960
behind some vague assertion
of executive power

17:37.961 --> 17:39.762
because I have something to fear

17:39.763 --> 17:41.297
- from the truth.
- She has a quirk about principles.

17:41.298 --> 17:42.832
Oh, we appreciate that about her.

17:42.833 --> 17:44.233
As do I, but moderation in all things.

17:44.234 --> 17:45.435
I understand how hard

17:45.436 --> 17:48.271
you must have worked to
make this happen, Russell,

17:48.272 --> 17:51.107
but I can't fall in line.

17:51.108 --> 17:53.276
I can't take the easy way out.

17:53.277 --> 17:56.379
I don't need to invoke
anything but the truth.

17:56.380 --> 17:58.715
Facing the music is the right call,

17:58.716 --> 18:01.484
and the administration
will be stronger for it.

18:01.485 --> 18:03.453
(sighs)

18:03.454 --> 18:05.188
Mr. President?

18:05.189 --> 18:06.789
I'm here with Elizabeth.

18:06.790 --> 18:09.457
She's declining executive privilege.

18:11.194 --> 18:14.129
Sure. Hang on.

18:17.934 --> 18:19.769
Hello, Mr. President.

18:19.770 --> 18:21.370
Elizabeth, I am strongly advising you

18:21.371 --> 18:22.972
to take executive privilege.

18:22.973 --> 18:25.274
- (continues indistinctly)
- Yes, sir. I... Yes, sir.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.476
DALTON: Do we understand each other?

18:26.477 --> 18:27.910
- Yes, sir.
- DALTON: Good.

18:27.911 --> 18:29.345
Thank you, Mr. President.

18:29.346 --> 18:30.645
Good-bye.

18:32.215 --> 18:35.084
So, it looks like I'm gonna
take that executive privilege.

18:35.085 --> 18:37.186
I love it when it all works out.

18:37.187 --> 18:39.721
(sighs)

18:41.891 --> 18:44.594
- (microwave beeps twice) - ELIZABETH: <i>Oh,
there's going to be a huge backlash, but...</i>

18:44.595 --> 18:46.496
the mathematicians tell me it is going

18:46.497 --> 18:47.864
to be a shorter backlash

18:47.865 --> 18:49.365
than actually appearing
before the committee.

18:49.366 --> 18:52.001
So, that's good horse trade, right?

18:52.002 --> 18:53.169
Who are you trying to convince, Mom?

18:53.170 --> 18:55.171
You guys, obviously.

18:55.172 --> 18:56.906
ALISON: Okay, yeah, but,
being complained about

18:56.907 --> 18:58.674
by pundits is marginally better

18:58.675 --> 19:01.177
- than being giffed a hundred times a day.
- See?

19:01.178 --> 19:04.080
Just like that, we're
in the plus column.

19:04.081 --> 19:07.016
Feel free to jump in here any
time you want and cheerlead.

19:07.017 --> 19:08.684
It's so obviously all good.

19:08.685 --> 19:11.254
Okay, I look like this.

19:11.255 --> 19:12.388
- Oh!
- Wow.

19:12.389 --> 19:14.524
Everyone, just get it
out of your system now.

19:14.525 --> 19:17.193
I am... I am speechless.

19:17.194 --> 19:19.896
I'm the plus one for a formal
event at the White House.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.496
With Harrison Dalton.

19:23.266 --> 19:25.001
It's his first formal appearance

19:25.002 --> 19:26.969
post rehab stint hitting the news.

19:26.970 --> 19:29.539
Some kind of dinner
for governors. Anyway,

19:29.540 --> 19:31.841
he needs a date, and I
make a better picture

19:31.842 --> 19:34.410
than his grizzled, welder-biker sponsor.

19:34.411 --> 19:36.779
So, you're flying fully into
the storm of Starrison?

19:36.780 --> 19:38.548
Diversion tactic.

19:38.549 --> 19:41.050
Better the journalists speculate
about us than his sobriety.

19:41.051 --> 19:42.418
They can pick at it all day.

19:42.419 --> 19:43.920
We are still just friends.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.288
Hmm. Truth as an offensive.

19:45.289 --> 19:47.623
Wherever did you learn that?

19:47.624 --> 19:49.225
But seriously, you'd
give us little heads-up

19:49.226 --> 19:50.960
if it were something, right?

19:50.961 --> 19:52.328
Believe me.

19:52.329 --> 19:53.896
If wanted to be with someone

19:53.897 --> 19:57.567
who was gonna complicate
your life, I'd be with Arthur.

19:57.568 --> 20:00.468
(doorbell rings)

20:03.506 --> 20:05.775
Sorry, ma'am. His credentials check out.

20:05.776 --> 20:06.976
I have a subpoena to appear

20:06.977 --> 20:08.544
before the Senate
Investigation Committee.

20:08.545 --> 20:10.646
- No, no, that's been settled.
- For Dr. Henry McCord.

20:10.647 --> 20:11.947
You've been served.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.663
<i>I have to give you a legal disclaimer.</i>

20:25.664 --> 20:27.399
- I am not your lawyer.
- Noted.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.591
And in my capacity
as not-your-lawyer,

20:29.592 --> 20:31.325
I cannot be privy to any information

20:31.326 --> 20:33.327
which might incriminate you or your wife

20:33.328 --> 20:34.628
without implicating myself.

20:34.629 --> 20:35.797
I'm here as

20:35.798 --> 20:37.499
non-legally-binding sage counsel.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.701
- Mike, got it.
- Okay.

20:39.702 --> 20:42.904
I called around the agencies,
cashed in a few chits.

20:42.905 --> 20:44.307
Someone connected a few dots,

20:44.308 --> 20:46.242
and then, tipped the senator

20:46.243 --> 20:49.312
that during Elizabeth's inquiry
into Marsh's death,

20:49.313 --> 20:52.812
she shared classified
information with you.

20:52.813 --> 20:54.581
If this is proven to be true,

20:54.582 --> 20:55.881
Elizabeth

20:55.882 --> 20:59.251
may be in violation
of the Espionage Act,

20:59.252 --> 21:00.719
among other federal statutes

21:00.720 --> 21:03.656
involving the improper handling
of classified material.

21:03.657 --> 21:05.591
Espionage. That's ridiculous.

21:05.592 --> 21:07.226
What information?

21:07.227 --> 21:09.128
Something about a plane crash in Dubai.

21:09.129 --> 21:11.664
I know you're not about
to say something.

21:11.665 --> 21:13.140
Look, I've been called to testify

21:13.141 --> 21:14.941
before a Senate Investigation Committee.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.309
It's not a court of law.

21:16.310 --> 21:17.610
True. It's a kangaroo court.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.812
Caruthers just...

21:18.813 --> 21:20.380
Good night.

21:20.381 --> 21:21.780
Good night, Noodle.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.150
- Night. Bye.
- Mm-hmm.

21:24.151 --> 21:26.086
I'll take you to school
in the morning, okay?

21:26.087 --> 21:27.921
Okay, sounds good.

21:27.922 --> 21:30.222
Love you.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.994
All Caruthers wants is
to bring down your wife.

21:34.995 --> 21:36.529
With her safely shrouded

21:36.530 --> 21:38.865
behind executive privilege, he's
going after the next best thing.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.700
A leaker case is very hard to prove.

21:40.701 --> 21:41.868
Won't matter.

21:41.869 --> 21:43.403
The damage will be done.

21:43.404 --> 21:47.173
If people think that I shared secrets,

21:47.174 --> 21:48.741
I'll lose the trust of the nation

21:48.742 --> 21:50.510
and the international community.

21:50.511 --> 21:54.114
Which makes it hard to be
America's next top diplomat.

21:54.115 --> 21:56.816
Thank you for your
non-legally-binding counsel,

21:56.817 --> 21:59.452
but... I've got to go with the truth.

21:59.453 --> 22:01.387
We were operating under
extreme circumstances...

22:01.388 --> 22:03.790
Stop making sounds with
consonants and vowels.

22:03.791 --> 22:05.458
I don't know how else to say it.

22:05.459 --> 22:09.028
First move is take the Fifth.

22:09.029 --> 22:11.264
- Absolutely not.
- I-I know. I know.

22:11.265 --> 22:13.733
It reeks of guilt...

22:13.734 --> 22:14.645
which is a bean scratcher,

22:14.646 --> 22:16.793
given it's meant to protect
you from self-incrimination.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.504
I'll work

22:17.505 --> 22:19.038
on finding you a lawyer.

22:19.039 --> 22:20.573
In the meantime,

22:20.574 --> 22:22.407
get some sleep.

22:23.143 --> 22:25.477
Thanks, Mike.

22:32.185 --> 22:33.553
Listen...

22:33.554 --> 22:35.020
we didn't do anything wrong.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.358
That doesn't matter.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.995
(door opens)

22:41.996 --> 22:44.330
I thought the investigation
into the Dubai crash

22:44.331 --> 22:45.732
had been declassified

22:45.733 --> 22:47.867
once the White House
ruled it an accident.

22:47.868 --> 22:51.070
Turns out not to be the case.

22:51.071 --> 22:52.705
They're on solid footing.

22:52.706 --> 22:55.208
George said that someone in the
CIA was behind Marsh's murder,

22:55.209 --> 22:56.709
and you suspected the president himself.

22:56.710 --> 22:58.244
Well, you can't say that.

22:58.245 --> 22:59.579
I can't say any of it.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.514
I know what I have to do.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.750
What do you mean?

23:03.751 --> 23:06.519
There's only one thing to do.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.855
- I'm not gonna let you take the fall.
- You can't lie.

23:08.856 --> 23:10.023
It's not lying.

23:10.024 --> 23:12.125
Dietrich Bonhoeffer
will back me up on that.

23:12.126 --> 23:13.326
You're basing your defense

23:13.327 --> 23:16.663
on one of the guys who
tried to kill Hitler?

23:16.664 --> 23:19.232
Technically, he was
convicted of draft evasion.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.000
Was he technically hanged, too?

23:21.001 --> 23:23.236
He taught that there are
some truths more fundamental

23:23.237 --> 23:25.138
than a... an immediate lie.

23:25.139 --> 23:28.341
Henry, you can't perjure yourself.

23:28.342 --> 23:30.376
Are you really... Are you serious?

23:30.377 --> 23:32.478
Taking the Fifth only covers me.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.547
They can still get me
to incriminate you.

23:34.548 --> 23:37.617
He just wants to take you down,

23:37.618 --> 23:39.118
by any means necessary.

23:39.119 --> 23:43.288
This whole thing just... lacks integrity.

23:44.390 --> 23:47.926
I feel no ethical obligation
to play by their rules.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.162
You could go to prison.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.333
No one's going to prison.

23:55.235 --> 23:58.304
STEVIE: <i>Okay. Here's my takeaway.</i>

23:58.305 --> 24:01.274
Governor's Association Dinner
equals old people prom.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.776
Oh, my God. That is totally right.

24:03.777 --> 24:06.679
Right down to the, uh,
chaperone checking my breath

24:06.680 --> 24:08.715
for booze every five seconds.

24:08.716 --> 24:11.751
Yeah, except this time
they didn't smell any.

24:11.752 --> 24:15.054
And thus I am able to
remember this night

24:15.055 --> 24:17.557
- in its entirety.
- (chuckles) Come on.

24:17.558 --> 24:19.092
It was nice.

24:19.093 --> 24:22.362
It was nice getting to be with you.

24:22.363 --> 24:26.132
Yeah. It was fun to hang out.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.400
What?

24:27.401 --> 24:29.369
Why are you looking at me all...

24:29.370 --> 24:32.739
weird and s-smoldery?

24:32.740 --> 24:35.441
Um, I'm about to kiss you.

24:35.442 --> 24:38.244
No, you're not. Don't.

24:38.245 --> 24:39.879
No, I'm not.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.914
I'm so not.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.255
Why not?

24:49.256 --> 24:51.624
Come on.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.726
We're friends.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.463
Wow.

24:57.464 --> 24:59.465
This really is like prom.

24:59.466 --> 25:02.268
I think we had this exact conversation.

25:02.269 --> 25:04.270
- (chuckles)
- At our last prom.

25:04.271 --> 25:06.039
- We... (laughs)
- (laughs)

25:06.040 --> 25:07.974
We totally did. Um...

25:07.975 --> 25:09.242
I-I'm, for one...

25:09.243 --> 25:11.110
I'm glad that we got to
relive the awkwardness.

25:11.111 --> 25:12.512
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:12.513 --> 25:14.614
This was so awesome.

25:14.615 --> 25:17.249
(chuckles)

25:19.886 --> 25:22.154
Good night, Blake.

25:23.222 --> 25:25.757
I see you there.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.331
I, uh... I-I hate to ask...

25:31.332 --> 25:32.332
Apparently.

25:32.333 --> 25:35.134
(sighs)

25:35.135 --> 25:39.138
It's about Secretary Marsh's portrait.

25:39.139 --> 25:42.442
It's being removed to make room
for James Madison's, but, uh,

25:42.443 --> 25:45.411
no one seems to...

25:45.412 --> 25:46.946
- Want it?
- They don't.

25:46.947 --> 25:48.715
And we can't just...

25:48.716 --> 25:51.050
- Throw it away.
- Yeah.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.752
Use your words, Blake.

25:52.753 --> 25:54.020
No. We can't throw it away

25:54.021 --> 25:55.521
because that's in violation of the 1912

25:55.522 --> 25:58.157
- War Department ruling.
- I don't know which is more ironic,

25:58.158 --> 26:00.360
that or the fact that we can't give away

26:00.361 --> 26:03.429
- such a vain man's picture.
- Ms. Tolliver,

26:03.430 --> 26:06.099
I truly didn't want to
dump this in your lap.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.735
Don't worry about it.

26:08.736 --> 26:10.636
I'll think of something.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.938
Thank you.

26:18.478 --> 26:20.846
(grunts with effort)

26:23.049 --> 26:24.984
Come on. Come to bed.

26:24.985 --> 26:26.753
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:26.754 --> 26:28.988
- I can't let you do this. I can't.
- It's gonna be okay. I...

26:28.989 --> 26:29.989
It's my decision.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.391
It'll change you.

26:31.392 --> 26:32.992
It'll change us.

26:32.993 --> 26:34.493
(sighs)

26:35.895 --> 26:38.163
We've been through worse.

26:41.134 --> 26:42.434
Okay.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.375
CORRESPONDENT: <i>Offensive sweeps
continued in northwestern Iraq today,</i>

26:49.376 --> 26:52.478
<i>as United States Marines
attempt to cut off the flow</i>

26:52.479 --> 26:54.147
<i>of foreign fighters</i>

26:54.148 --> 26:55.448
crossing the Syrian border.

26:55.449 --> 26:58.985
The advance began with a
series of predawn air strikes

26:58.986 --> 27:00.319
and continued with...

27:00.320 --> 27:03.021
- I'm listening to that.
- You want some help?

27:16.335 --> 27:18.771
- I don't want to fight about this.
- Well, great.

27:18.772 --> 27:22.607
We'll just skip right
to resentful silence.

27:23.509 --> 27:26.145
If you feel you have to
go to Baghdad, then go,

27:26.146 --> 27:28.247
but I can't pretend it's
not going to affect me.

27:28.248 --> 27:30.082
It's definitely gonna affect the kids.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.819
The one thing it's not going
to do is take back 9/11.

27:32.820 --> 27:34.987
(sighs) This isn't about atonement.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.322
Then what is it about?

27:36.323 --> 27:40.460
The world has fallen apart.

27:40.461 --> 27:44.163
Do you know how many of our
troops were killed today? 37.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.699
We just broke 1,400 in a
war that was supposed

27:46.700 --> 27:48.267
to be over two years ago.

27:48.268 --> 27:51.037
And that's not even counting the civilians.

27:51.038 --> 27:55.141
It's like some monster
has been unleashed.

27:55.142 --> 27:57.747
- I don't even recognize what our
government is doing anymore. - I know.

27:57.748 --> 27:59.479
- How can I just sit by?
- The world has collapsed.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.814
But that doesn't mean ours
has to, to make up for it.

28:01.815 --> 28:04.283
When everything seems to
be lacking in integrity,

28:04.284 --> 28:05.885
you know what you do?

28:05.886 --> 28:08.888
You find it in yourself.

28:08.889 --> 28:11.557
You change the world

28:11.558 --> 28:14.259
right from where you're standing.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.830
Conrad is depending on me.

28:17.831 --> 28:20.800
It's-it's either take the position or quit.

28:20.801 --> 28:22.634
I can't go backwards.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.672
It's a year. I'll be back.

28:26.673 --> 28:28.674
If you...

28:28.675 --> 28:31.977
go to Baghdad, I...

28:33.346 --> 28:37.315
I don't know what it's gonna
look like when you come back.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.059
(ringtone plays)

28:47.060 --> 28:49.995
(phone buzzing)

28:55.067 --> 28:56.435
Sorry to wake you up.

28:56.436 --> 28:58.971
Oh. You have to be kidding. (chuckles)

28:58.972 --> 29:01.674
We can keep this brief.

29:01.675 --> 29:04.977
Tell me there's no way you
shared classified information

29:04.978 --> 29:07.046
with Henry.

29:07.047 --> 29:09.549
We have to stay ahead of this.

29:09.550 --> 29:12.017
You know that.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.955
Cut to the chase, Russell.

29:15.956 --> 29:20.026
We have a second term to win.

29:20.027 --> 29:22.361
I'll have to keep the president

29:22.362 --> 29:25.964
at a safe distance.

29:29.402 --> 29:31.737
Are-are we talking...

29:31.738 --> 29:34.574
resignation or...

29:34.575 --> 29:35.808
(sighs)

29:35.809 --> 29:39.979
We can get around contempt
of Congress but not this.

29:39.980 --> 29:43.749
Not violating the Espionage Act.

29:43.750 --> 29:47.520
- I just...
- (Henry and Alison speaking indistinctly)

29:47.521 --> 29:49.155
I just wanted to give you a
heads-up, but I-I don't know

29:49.156 --> 29:51.157
what Henry's gonna say before
the committee tomorrow.

29:51.158 --> 29:54.727
I don't know... I don't know
how this is gonna go.

29:54.728 --> 29:57.964
But if it goes badly...

29:57.965 --> 30:01.466
You and the president won't protect me.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.973
Sorry. I'm sorry.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.583
Thank you. And, finally,
these are the appointments

30:17.584 --> 30:19.652
for our CVE Summit at the White House.

30:19.653 --> 30:22.788
What time does Dr. McCord testify?

30:22.789 --> 30:25.090
2:00.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.363
Walk with me, Blake.

30:30.364 --> 30:31.897
Yes, ma'am.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.265
Where are we going?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.767
We're taking a lap.

30:34.768 --> 30:37.203
How many steps we got so far?

30:37.204 --> 30:39.905
Uh, 156.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.707
Let's pick up the pace.

30:41.708 --> 30:43.175
I didn't realize you
were Fitbitting, ma'am.

30:43.176 --> 30:44.710
I could work that into your schedule.

30:44.711 --> 30:46.679
No. I don't want to make it a thing.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.649
- Just working off the donut
I had this morning. - Ma'am.

30:49.650 --> 30:53.485
Well, maybe two. Okay, two.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.060
No. No way.

31:01.061 --> 31:03.929
- Uh, I'm sorry. I-I meant for
this to happen sooner. - No way.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.449
I ran into some roadblocks...

31:05.450 --> 31:08.200
This isn't right. Have
my motorcade brought up.

31:08.201 --> 31:09.201
I'm going out.

31:09.202 --> 31:11.402
Yes, ma'am.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.074
CARUTHERS: <i>The purpose of this hearing</i>

31:15.075 --> 31:16.609
is to seek the truth

31:16.610 --> 31:18.944
on behalf of the American
people, so it stands

31:18.945 --> 31:22.948
to reason that we should receive
access to all decisions,

31:22.949 --> 31:24.283
all relevant documents,

31:24.284 --> 31:25.851
and all witnesses.

31:25.852 --> 31:29.722
One moment. Mr. Chairman.

31:29.723 --> 31:31.357
What's going on?

31:31.358 --> 31:33.959
No idea.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.294
Whew.

31:35.295 --> 31:37.391
- (indistinct chatter)
- CARUTHERS: Oh, Secretary McCord.

31:37.392 --> 31:38.798
We didn't expect you.

31:38.799 --> 31:40.899
Yet here I am.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.868
Ready to testify.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.907
What are you doing?

31:47.908 --> 31:49.408
You know what you do
when there's no integrity

31:49.409 --> 31:51.077
in a situation, Henry?

31:51.078 --> 31:52.844
You find it in yourself.

31:53.779 --> 31:58.082
You change the world
right where we're standing.

32:00.286 --> 32:04.056
Senator, I'm waiving
executive privilege,

32:04.057 --> 32:06.559
and I'm prepared to take the oath.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.160
(gallery murmuring)

32:16.010 --> 32:19.783
If Vincent Marsh was murdered,
it was probably an inside job.

32:19.784 --> 32:23.628
I could only work with someone I trusted,

32:23.629 --> 32:25.630
and that meant my husband,

32:25.631 --> 32:30.102
a man I have ruthlessly
vetted for over 25 years.

32:30.103 --> 32:31.837
Man...

32:31.838 --> 32:33.772
I have never heard such
an eloquent defense

32:33.773 --> 32:35.907
for violating the Espionage Act.

32:35.908 --> 32:39.376
Do you think she could go to prison?

32:41.646 --> 32:42.647
Listen,

32:42.648 --> 32:44.483
half the guys I knew on Wall Street

32:44.484 --> 32:46.017
should be there, but aren't.

32:46.018 --> 32:48.887
If they try to take
your mother for this...

32:48.888 --> 32:51.690
hell, I'll be the first one
to man the barricades.

32:51.691 --> 32:54.926
...in Iran, which, in turn,
uncovered treason...

32:54.927 --> 32:56.027
So that's a maybe.

32:56.028 --> 32:57.963
...at the highest levels
of American government.

32:57.964 --> 33:00.332
Yeah.

33:00.333 --> 33:02.701
I guess it is.

33:02.702 --> 33:04.536
Forces have been
unleashed to destabilize

33:04.537 --> 33:07.938
the security of our country.

33:09.441 --> 33:13.345
I put myself in harm's way

33:13.346 --> 33:15.881
to ensure the safety of our country.

33:15.882 --> 33:19.183
I... (wry chuckle)

33:19.885 --> 33:21.820
I would do it again, sir.

33:21.821 --> 33:25.223
So, Mr. Chairman, I'd say

33:25.224 --> 33:27.426
the only reason that we're
here today, luxuriating

33:27.427 --> 33:30.695
in the smug banality of a
Senate hearing instead

33:30.696 --> 33:32.330
of ducking for cover in all-out war,

33:32.331 --> 33:36.268
is because I had the decency
to violate Section 793

33:36.269 --> 33:38.470
of Title 18.

33:38.471 --> 33:40.505
Whew.

33:40.506 --> 33:42.507
Thank you.

33:42.508 --> 33:45.577
No, let me rephrase that.

33:45.578 --> 33:47.746
You're welcome.

33:47.747 --> 33:49.914
(energetic chatter,
cameras clicking rapidly)

33:51.349 --> 33:54.119
Secretary McCord,

33:54.120 --> 33:55.654
you are not dismissed.

33:55.655 --> 33:58.490
HENRY: <i>"The truth is like a lion.</i>

33:58.491 --> 34:01.259
"You don't need to defend it.

34:01.260 --> 34:04.196
Let it loose, and it'll defend itself."

34:04.197 --> 34:05.864
See? I listen to you.

34:05.865 --> 34:08.199
- Mmm, Augustine.
- And Augustine.

34:08.201 --> 34:11.136
And Aquinas. And the Beatles.

34:11.137 --> 34:14.103
And all the other guys you live by.

34:15.674 --> 34:18.275
Well, go big or go home, I guess.

34:18.277 --> 34:21.346
It was the right thing to do.

34:21.347 --> 34:23.348
Totally. But if I can
escort us back to Earth,

34:23.349 --> 34:25.817
I just got confirmation that the
committee is officially seeking

34:25.818 --> 34:28.652
to file charges against you for
violating the Espionage Act.

34:30.589 --> 34:35.193
ANCHORMAN: <i>In the wake of the Secretary
of State's fiery appearance,</i>

34:35.194 --> 34:38.063
Senator Caruthers has referred
the secretary's testimony

34:38.063 --> 34:39.264
to the Justice Department,

34:39.264 --> 34:41.666
which will be filing criminal charges...

34:41.667 --> 34:43.668
Wait, what are you doing?

34:43.668 --> 34:46.556
Ugh, that stuff is just
gonna stress us out.

34:46.558 --> 34:48.025
Come on.

34:48.025 --> 34:49.493
Who wants to settle Catan with me?

34:49.494 --> 34:50.860
Hey, guys.

34:50.862 --> 34:52.529
How's everybody doing?

34:52.530 --> 34:53.797
So...

34:53.797 --> 34:55.331
so is Mom getting arrested?

34:55.333 --> 34:57.935
I just talked to her. She had
a few things to finish at work.

34:57.936 --> 34:59.069
She'll be back any minute.

34:59.070 --> 35:01.672
You didn't answer the question.

35:01.673 --> 35:03.874
Okay, listen.

35:03.875 --> 35:07.845
Your mom spoke truth to power today,

35:07.846 --> 35:10.681
and that is a brave and rare thing.

35:10.682 --> 35:12.449
No matter what happens,
we're all gonna be okay.

35:12.450 --> 35:14.685
- (phone buzzes)
- So I want you

35:14.686 --> 35:17.454
to remember this day
with great pride. You got it?

35:17.455 --> 35:18.989
These guys were champs, by the way.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.556
You, too, kid.

35:22.292 --> 35:24.528
- What is that?
- ALISON: Corn.

35:24.529 --> 35:26.930
- HENRY: Corn? I want it. No, no.
I want... Give it. - ALISON: No.

35:26.931 --> 35:28.881
NADINE: <i>Thank you so
much for doing this.</i>

35:28.882 --> 35:30.779
I would've reached out
to the family myself,

35:30.780 --> 35:32.013
but it was awkward.

35:32.014 --> 35:34.482
I mean, with us not being
able to find a home for it.

35:34.483 --> 35:36.150
This is what lawyers do.
We're lubricants

35:36.151 --> 35:37.919
for complicated social intercourse.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.489
That's... appetizingly put.

35:41.490 --> 35:44.492
You know, I represented
Vincent for 30 years.

35:44.493 --> 35:46.160
I knew him since college.

35:46.161 --> 35:48.529
He was like a brother.

35:48.530 --> 35:50.298
And here...

35:50.299 --> 35:54.936
he has this whole
traitorous thing going on.

35:54.937 --> 35:57.572
I thought he was a true patriot.

35:57.573 --> 35:59.206
Well, I guess

35:59.207 --> 36:01.509
- in his eyes, he was.
- You know,

36:01.510 --> 36:05.112
I come to bury Caesar,
not to praise him, but, uh...

36:05.113 --> 36:07.648
you shouldn't beat yourself up.

36:07.649 --> 36:10.885
He was a very charismatic enigma.

36:10.886 --> 36:13.187
- (elevator bell dings)
- I don't understand.

36:13.188 --> 36:15.289
He told me everything.

36:15.290 --> 36:19.226
Well, not everything
but, uh, you know...

36:19.227 --> 36:21.729
I honestly always thought
you could do better.

36:21.730 --> 36:24.465
Now you got something
going with the NASA guy.

36:24.466 --> 36:27.100
Good. Good for you. You deserve it.

36:27.969 --> 36:31.237
Come on. It's Washington.

36:46.687 --> 36:48.289
Hey.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.625
Hey.

36:50.626 --> 36:51.859
(chuckles)

36:51.860 --> 36:56.130
I got to say, I was
surprised to get your text.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.398
Well...

37:00.568 --> 37:02.402
...surprise.

37:17.385 --> 37:19.652
Uh...

37:23.224 --> 37:26.594
Do you have something
you want to talk about

37:26.595 --> 37:28.763
or are you just...

37:28.764 --> 37:30.263
wanting to do this?

37:32.533 --> 37:35.202
Yeah. Um...

37:35.203 --> 37:39.607
I had to end my relationship
because of my mom's job,

37:39.608 --> 37:44.410
and now she's probably
gonna go to prison, anyway.

37:45.646 --> 37:48.249
I don't know how I'm supposed
to live a normal life. It's...

37:48.250 --> 37:50.851
it's just... (sighs)

37:50.852 --> 37:55.389
You're the only one
who gets it, you know?

37:55.390 --> 37:58.325
I'm really sick of worrying
about where everything is going,

37:58.326 --> 37:59.860
and tonight I just don't want to.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.529
Well, hey...

38:01.530 --> 38:05.031
then... don't worry about it.

38:21.716 --> 38:25.018
(moaning)

38:26.153 --> 38:28.421
(passionate moaning, breathing)

38:38.474 --> 38:40.967
<i>Thanks for coming, Bess.
A lot to talk about.</i>

38:40.968 --> 38:42.768
I didn't want to get
into it on the phone.

38:42.769 --> 38:45.938
I'm just hoping you're not
escorting me to my new quarters.

38:45.939 --> 38:47.172
Are you?

38:47.173 --> 38:48.908
Just got word DOJ is not
pressing charges against you.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.577
(sighing with relief): Oh, thank God!

38:51.578 --> 38:53.979
Willing to go to prison and
being sanguine about it

38:53.980 --> 38:56.815
are two entirely different camps.

38:56.816 --> 38:58.918
They're citing
extraordinary circumstances

38:58.919 --> 39:01.553
and the contribution
to national security.

39:01.554 --> 39:02.955
It doesn't hurt

39:02.956 --> 39:04.924
that your testimony strongly
swayed public opinion.

39:04.925 --> 39:06.558
Russell took a snap poll.

39:06.559 --> 39:09.228
82% think you were
justified in your actions.

39:09.229 --> 39:10.562
If I were Raymond Caruthers,

39:10.563 --> 39:12.665
I would be running for the hills.

39:12.666 --> 39:14.433
JULIET (over speaker):
Marsh was confronted

39:14.434 --> 39:16.902
by Russell Jackson about his intentions

39:16.903 --> 39:19.972
to run for president himself.

39:19.973 --> 39:23.409
At that time, Marsh lost his
nerve about the coup in Iran...

39:23.410 --> 39:25.978
She agreed to the deal this morning.

39:25.979 --> 39:28.247
Anything we want to know
in exchange for her life.

39:28.248 --> 39:31.317
...he wanted the coup attempt
to end, but Andrew and I...

39:31.318 --> 39:33.852
Late CIA Director Andrew Munsey.

39:33.853 --> 39:35.254
Yes.

39:35.255 --> 39:36.822
We weren't about to pull the plug

39:36.823 --> 39:39.425
on an operation we'd planned for so long

39:39.426 --> 39:42.661
It was decided that
Marsh was now a threat

39:42.662 --> 39:44.897
to the operation, which
had to be eliminated...

39:44.898 --> 39:47.231
She's using a passive voice.

39:48.167 --> 39:49.969
Distancing herself from it.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.870
JULIET: Yes.

39:51.871 --> 39:54.673
HENDRICKS: Using information
you acquired...

39:54.674 --> 39:56.308
He's a "threat."

39:56.309 --> 39:59.445
Not a person.

39:59.446 --> 40:01.547
Her time in Baghdad changed her.

40:01.548 --> 40:04.249
It might have changed me.

40:04.250 --> 40:06.385
No.

40:06.386 --> 40:08.921
You're made from different stuff.

40:08.922 --> 40:11.657
JULIET: We studied the crash in Dubai...

40:11.658 --> 40:15.027
and figured out how to
facilitate a similar incident.

40:15.028 --> 40:18.797
Obviously, we were successful.

40:18.798 --> 40:20.332
George Peters.

40:20.333 --> 40:22.735
Tell us about the death

40:22.736 --> 40:26.171
of CIA Operative George Peters.

40:26.172 --> 40:28.207
George...

40:28.208 --> 40:31.110
When Marshall's plane
went down, George...

40:31.111 --> 40:34.046
he recognized the similarities.

40:34.047 --> 40:35.948
He connected the dots.

40:35.949 --> 40:38.917
We became aware that he confided

40:38.918 --> 40:41.186
his suspicions in our...

40:41.187 --> 40:43.422
former colleague turned
Secretary of State,

40:43.423 --> 40:45.824
Elizabeth McCord.

40:45.825 --> 40:47.359
Back to her.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.329
DALTON: You okay?

40:50.330 --> 40:52.631
So I tampered with
the microchip controlling

40:52.632 --> 40:56.468
the acceleration system of his car.

40:56.469 --> 40:58.270
It just looked like a
single-car collision.

40:58.271 --> 41:01.607
He was becoming unstable.

41:01.608 --> 41:04.342
We didn't think anyone would question it.

41:05.677 --> 41:08.347
Remind her they were friends.

41:08.348 --> 41:11.582
Wasn't George Peters
a good friend of yours?

41:13.252 --> 41:15.454
JULIET: I guess there was a time

41:15.455 --> 41:17.855
when we were all friends.

41:19.258 --> 41:22.528
<i>(indistinct chatter)</i>

41:22.529 --> 41:24.963
<i>(woman laughing)</i>

41:24.964 --> 41:27.366
DALTON: A horse farm? Really?

41:27.367 --> 41:29.068
Uh, it's how I was raised.

41:29.069 --> 41:30.873
- I'm recreating my childhood.
- Henry's not from Virginia, is he?

41:30.874 --> 41:31.837
No, he's from rural Pennsylvania.

41:31.838 --> 41:33.539
It's the same difference.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.907
He's outdoorsy.

41:34.908 --> 41:37.324
He's got that whole chopping
and digging thing...

41:37.877 --> 41:39.812
- "Chopping and digging."
- But the horses are all me.

41:39.813 --> 41:41.313
Well, it sounds stultifying.

41:41.314 --> 41:43.348
And you have an open
invitation anytime you want.

41:43.349 --> 41:44.236
You don't even have to call.

41:44.237 --> 41:45.390
- All you guys.
- Okay.

41:45.391 --> 41:46.621
- We'll keep that in mind.
- Well...

41:46.622 --> 41:48.656
- Here's to Elizabeth's new life.
- Mm.

41:48.657 --> 41:49.924
And to our new Baghdad Station Chief.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.459
- (chuckles)
- ELIZABETH: Yes!

41:51.460 --> 41:52.426
Happy trails all around.

41:52.427 --> 41:53.895
- Happy trails!
- Thank you.

41:53.896 --> 41:55.897
I'm completely unfazed by
being the second choice.

41:55.898 --> 41:57.632
Just amazed I was a choice at all.

41:57.633 --> 41:59.600
MUNSEY: Are you kidding?
I've been on the receiving end

41:59.601 --> 42:00.835
of your friendly interrogations.

42:00.836 --> 42:02.770
There will be no need for enhancement.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.605
- Thank you for your faith in my iciness.
- It's true.

42:04.606 --> 42:07.341
You have that whole stern
mother thing down pat.

42:07.342 --> 42:08.776
In fact, you're gonna be way

42:08.777 --> 42:10.444
ahead of the game
when you have kids.

42:10.445 --> 42:11.546
Which, by the way,

42:11.547 --> 42:12.647
you should really do.

42:12.648 --> 42:14.882
Top of the list when I
get back from Baghdad.

42:14.883 --> 42:16.484
Conrad, I am gonna be shorthanded.

42:16.485 --> 42:17.919
I hope you have some
rabbits in your hat.

42:17.920 --> 42:19.620
I'm bringing Isabelle back from London.

42:19.621 --> 42:21.422
And, uh, then I have some ideas.

42:21.423 --> 42:24.692
- Mostly about overworking the two of you.
- Hey, pile it on.

42:24.693 --> 42:26.460
My wife will be thrilled
to have me home even less.

42:26.461 --> 42:27.695
- And I am not kidding.
- Oh, stop.

42:27.696 --> 42:28.829
- I'm not kidding!
- He's not!

42:28.830 --> 42:29.931
- There he is!
- (all clamoring)

42:29.932 --> 42:32.133
Sorry I'm late. The beltway.

42:32.134 --> 42:33.668
(laughter, chatter)

42:33.669 --> 42:35.236
Baghdad's got nothing to compare.

42:35.237 --> 42:36.771
Hey, I love his cool perspective.

42:36.772 --> 42:38.306
Never a hyperbole in sight.

42:38.307 --> 42:41.175
I don't think anyone here
values me for my low volume.

42:41.176 --> 42:44.278
So, where is my drink
and who is my new boss?

42:44.279 --> 42:46.914
- Ta-da!
- Whoa! - (whoops)

42:46.915 --> 42:49.050
Elizabeth is running
away to a horse farm!

42:49.051 --> 42:52.119
Really? What, I don't check my e-mail

42:52.120 --> 42:55.256
for an hour and this is what happens?

42:55.257 --> 42:57.134
Gee, thanks for your vote of confidence.

42:57.135 --> 42:58.259
I'm just surprised.

42:58.260 --> 43:00.494
It's gonna be great.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.504
- No, I mean, I love all my girls.
- (laughter)

43:02.505 --> 43:03.764
I do, really!

43:03.765 --> 43:06.701
But sitting at a desk and-and...

43:06.702 --> 43:08.436
trying to decide which font to use.

43:08.437 --> 43:11.238
I'm surprised the
dropout rate isn't higher.

43:11.239 --> 43:13.074
All that saving your ass
when you don't listen to us

43:13.075 --> 43:14.275
and go rogue.

43:14.276 --> 43:15.376
That happened once, young lady!

43:15.377 --> 43:16.611
Oh, come on!

43:16.612 --> 43:18.446
- I-I got six cities!
- I-I got three.

43:18.447 --> 43:21.082
- Peshawar, Kandahar...
- (dinging on glass)

43:21.083 --> 43:23.351
One more time.

43:23.352 --> 43:24.318
(shushes)

43:24.319 --> 43:26.187
To the inner sanctum.

43:26.188 --> 43:28.556
Colleagues,

43:28.557 --> 43:30.191
friends,

43:30.192 --> 43:31.459
noble warriors.

43:31.460 --> 43:34.427
(all agreeing) Hear, hear!
