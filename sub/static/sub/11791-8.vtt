22:40.050 --> 22:42.484
MY MOMS EXS.

22:42.490 --> 22:43.479
SHE WAS A REAL BITCH, BUT

22:43.490 --> 22:46.482
A DYNAMITE PASTRY CHEF.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.559
>> OH, AT LEAST THERE WAS

22:57.670 --> 22:59.035
ITS GOING TO TAKE A LOT

22:59.040 --> 23:00.541
MORE THAN A FRUITCAKE AFTER WHAT

23:00.550 --> 23:02.745
YOUVE DONE.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.502
>> YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO HATE

23:04.510 --> 23:06.398
ME, JULIA. MY BEING WITH SEAN

23:06.410 --> 23:08.401

23:08.410 --> 23:10.617
ACTING OUT, I GUESS.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.518
>> I USED TO LOVE FRUITCAKE WHEN

23:42.520 --> 23:46.513
I WAS A GIRL.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.957
ITS SO FATTENING.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.537
JULIA, BUT I DONT THINK SEAN

24:33.540 --> 24:36.566

24:36.570 --> 24:38.197
>> OH, I DONT KNOW. YOU KNOW,

24:38.200 --> 24:40.236
IT MIGHT HELP HIM.

24:40.240 --> 24:44.745
FORGIVE AND MOVE ON.
