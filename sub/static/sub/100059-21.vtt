WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:06.615
- Hey.
Just got an email from HR.

00:06.658 --> 00:07.659
Carol's doing pretty well.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.139
She can say her consonants
again.

00:09.183 --> 00:10.140
- Nice.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.750
Whole words
should be any day now.

00:11.794 --> 00:14.536
So you're up for a job
at Zephra, huh?

00:14.579 --> 00:15.841
What?

00:15.885 --> 00:17.756
Close the door.
- Oh.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.628
- How did you hear?

00:19.671 --> 00:21.804
- I have my ways.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.154
Specifically, corporate called
and asked me for a reference.

00:24.198 --> 00:25.416
I mean, I have my ways,

00:25.460 --> 00:27.201
but I didn't need to use them
this time.

00:27.244 --> 00:29.159
- Okay.
Well, what did you tell them?

00:29.203 --> 00:30.160
- The truth.

00:30.204 --> 00:31.553
You're smart, hardworking,

00:31.596 --> 00:33.381
and a lot of fun to be around
in medium quantities.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.730
- Okay.
Yeah.

00:34.773 --> 00:35.861
That could've gone worse.

00:35.905 --> 00:38.212
- So what happens
if you get it?

00:38.255 --> 00:40.649
You and Pretty Boy gonna move
out to Zephra HQ,

00:40.692 --> 00:42.694
abandon us
for that California life?

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
Sucking down avocados,

00:44.305 --> 00:46.133
Jonah wearing T-shirts
in pools.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.482
- Jonah doesn't even know
about this yet.

00:47.525 --> 00:49.353
It's just the regional round
of interviews,

00:49.397 --> 00:50.876
and it's such a long shot

00:50.920 --> 00:52.878
that it's not worth getting
into a whole conversation

00:52.922 --> 00:54.271
about our future.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.099
- So this'll just be
our little secret then.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.535
Like how Sayid has a huge wang.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.103
- That's not--wait, really?

01:00.147 --> 01:02.540
Okay, look, I'm just gonna be
gone for a couple hours,

01:02.584 --> 01:04.368
so I told Jonah
I'm going to the eye doctor.

01:04.412 --> 01:05.369
Will you please just--

01:05.413 --> 01:06.370
- Got it.

01:06.414 --> 01:07.545
You're putting your trust in me

01:07.589 --> 01:09.199
and I will do everything
in my power

01:09.243 --> 01:10.722
to ensure
that Jonah does not find out.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.333
- Your powers
are not really needed here.

01:12.376 --> 01:13.769
Just pretend
like nothing is happening.

01:13.812 --> 01:16.119
- One performance of a lifetime
coming right up.

01:16.163 --> 01:18.165
- There's no performance
necessary.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.470
- Don't worry.
I got this.

01:19.514 --> 01:20.732
- Just--less is more!

01:20.776 --> 01:22.517
Nothing is best!

01:31.352 --> 01:34.268
- I can't believe that Brett
gets to be the Easter Bunny.

01:34.311 --> 01:36.792
I was begging to do it,
but corporate said

01:36.835 --> 01:39.186
that anyone who asks
more than three times can't

01:39.229 --> 01:40.796
'cause of pedophile stuff.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.407
- Hate to agree with corporate,
but that policy feels right.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.757
- It's Easter fever
at our place right now.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.498
Jerry's been practicing
his finding skills

01:47.542 --> 01:48.499
for the egg hunt.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.240
He's--he's getting there.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.416
- Being newlyweds
sounds so fun.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.201
You must be doing it
all the time.

01:54.244 --> 01:55.202
- Uh-huh.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.942
- All that sex and no baby.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.641
When's Jerry gonna put the bun
in the uterus?

01:59.684 --> 02:02.644
- Fair question, but actually,

02:02.687 --> 02:04.167
when we're ready,
we're gonna adopt.

02:04.211 --> 02:06.430
There's so many kids out there
who need homes.

02:06.474 --> 02:09.172
Plus, we love our cat,
and we adopted her.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.653
- Right, as opposed to
birthing her yourself.

02:11.696 --> 02:13.916
- Oh, that is wonderful.

02:13.959 --> 02:17.267
A family is the greatest gift
that you can give a child and--

02:17.311 --> 02:18.834
and it makes sense,
'cause you know,

02:18.877 --> 02:21.358
it can be hard to get pregnant
at our age.

02:21.402 --> 02:23.621
- Oh, I think
I'm actually younger than you.

02:23.665 --> 02:25.449
- Oh.
Okay.

02:25.493 --> 02:26.755
Younger, taller, sure.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.713
Whatever you need
to tell yourself, Sandra.

02:31.238 --> 02:34.458
- ♪ Happy birthday to you

02:34.502 --> 02:36.808
♪ Happy birthday to you

02:36.852 --> 02:38.201
- Aww.
You don't have to--

02:38.245 --> 02:41.683
- ♪ Don't interrupt me,
dear Cheyenne ♪

02:41.726 --> 02:44.468
♪ Happy birthday to

02:49.734 --> 02:51.475
♪ You

02:51.519 --> 02:54.696
- Thanks, but my birthday
isn't till Saturday.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.176
- Oh, I know.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.873
I just wanted to make sure
that when you finally have

02:57.916 --> 02:59.396
your first legal drink,
it's from me.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.745
So are we gonna have a party?
- Nah.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.138
We're broke as ass right now,

03:02.182 --> 03:05.272
so we'll probably just
stay home and eat SpaghettiOs

03:05.315 --> 03:07.448
and listen to the neighbors
fight.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.666
- No, you--

03:08.710 --> 03:10.581
you have to have a party.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.235
Just ask your friends
to chip in

03:12.279 --> 03:13.932
or, I don't know,
charge them to come.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.674
- You think people wanna pay
to watch me get drunk?

03:16.718 --> 03:18.676
- Cheyenne,
you're young and hot.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.504
People would pay
to watch you kill a goat.

03:20.548 --> 03:21.549
- Thank you.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.681
- We are throwing you a party.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.640
- Yay!

03:28.599 --> 03:29.992
Sorry.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.385
I'm a little nervous.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.691
- Yeah, me too.

03:33.735 --> 03:36.825
So are you coming
from consulting or finance?

03:36.868 --> 03:38.566
- Um, retail.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.742
- Ah.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.309
- Oh, look at that.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.919
All Latinas.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.573
- Oh.

03:45.616 --> 03:46.791
That's funny.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.315
- More like Zephra
looked in their crayon box

03:48.358 --> 03:50.360
and realized
they're missing a brown one.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.667
- Oh, I don't think it's that.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.500
She could be Greek.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.936
- Could you restock
the Icelandic yogurt

04:00.979 --> 04:02.329
when you get a chance?

04:02.372 --> 04:04.287
Apparently, every country
in Europe gets a shot now.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.332
- Yeah, I will,

04:05.375 --> 04:06.637
although I'll have to check
with Amy

04:06.681 --> 04:08.291
because I'm not sure
the new shipment came in

04:08.335 --> 04:09.858
last night.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.295
- Well,
Amy is at the eye doctor.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.689
- Yeah, I know.
I mean when she gets back.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.343
- From the eye doctor.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.432
- Yep.
- 'Cause that's where she is.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.390
- Mm-hmm.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.913
- They're checking her out
for a dead spot.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.306
- What?
- Yeah.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.699
Right eye,
10 degrees off center,

04:24.742 --> 04:26.309
about the size of a baseball,
she said.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.050
- Wow, that's a lot of detail.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.573
- It is,
and I bet you're wondering

04:29.617 --> 04:30.922
why she hasn't mentioned it.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.620
It's because
she doesn't want you to worry.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.012
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.493
You know, because
if the dead spot gets worse,

04:36.537 --> 04:38.887
and let's be honest, it will,

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
you're gonna be the person
taking care of her.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.587
Feeding, bathing,
describing the ocean.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.894
Anyway,
it's gonna be beautiful.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.765
Like a Nicholas Sparks novel.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.028
I'm excited about that for you.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.512
- ♪ Here comes
Peter Cottontail ♪

04:55.556 --> 04:57.993
♪ Hopping down
the bunny trail ♪

04:58.036 --> 04:59.908
- Tony!

04:59.951 --> 05:01.518
Thank you for coming.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.433
Sandra, this is Tony,

05:03.477 --> 05:06.088
one of my original foster kids,

05:06.131 --> 05:09.352
but the family he's living with
is moving to Canada, you know,

05:09.396 --> 05:11.615
and Jerusha and I
have our hands so full

05:11.659 --> 05:12.660
with Rose.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.357
Anyway, you were saying

05:14.401 --> 05:18.013
how you and Jerry wanted
to adopt a child, so...

05:19.144 --> 05:22.104
- So she should adopt
this gentleman?

05:23.192 --> 05:24.976
- Um...

05:25.020 --> 05:27.152
Wow.
Thank you, but--

05:27.196 --> 05:28.632
- Okay, look,

05:28.676 --> 05:30.460
I know you weren't planning
on adopting right away,

05:30.504 --> 05:32.636
but Tony
is such an incredible kid.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.987
He's a straight-A student,
captain of the baseball team,

05:36.031 --> 05:39.991
and he makes an amazing
grilled cheese sandwich.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.558
- I butter both sides
of the bread.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.821
- Oh, so good.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.562
- Well, I just don't know if--

05:45.606 --> 05:47.564
- Okay, look, you don't
have to decide right now,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.958
but tell you what,
why don't we all have lunch

05:50.001 --> 05:53.135
and see if any sparks fly, huh?

05:53.178 --> 05:54.354
- Okay.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.185
- This is weird, right?

06:00.229 --> 06:01.752
- Well, this is what happens

06:01.796 --> 06:04.407
when a company realizes
that Latinas spend money.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.582
- Yeah.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.844
- Hey, if it gets me a seat
at the table,

06:06.888 --> 06:08.455
I'm not above rolling my Rs.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.891
- Yeah, sometimes you just
gotta do the dance.

06:09.934 --> 06:12.110
- Right.
Right.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.069
But you don't mean, like,
a literal dance, right?

06:14.112 --> 06:15.679
'Cause I don't know any.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.072
- Amy Sosa?

06:17.115 --> 06:18.203
- That's me.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.683
Um...

06:19.727 --> 06:22.773
Amelia Sosa.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.080
Or just--just Amy is fine.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.042
- All right, I texted Amy
and she's not responding,

06:31.086 --> 06:33.218
but there is obviously
no such thing

06:33.262 --> 06:35.307
as an eye dead spot.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.962
Which I know
because I looked it up.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.661
- All right, fine.
I'll tell you the truth.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.054
She's not at the eye doctor.

06:43.098 --> 06:45.230
She's taking
a saxophone lesson.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.232
She wants to surprise you
with a smooth jazz version

06:47.276 --> 06:49.060
of a contemporary hit.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.540
- Okay.
Dina.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.237
You have to tell me
where Amy is.

06:52.281 --> 06:53.543
- Totally.
I'd love to.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.284
It's just that...

06:57.025 --> 06:59.462
Brett is biting it so hard
at being the Easter Bunny.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.724
Look at him.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.639
He's garbage.

07:02.683 --> 07:04.075
I gotta go tag in.

07:04.119 --> 07:05.076
- No, I--

07:05.120 --> 07:07.078
I know you're lying!

07:07.122 --> 07:09.690
Brett was born
to wear that suit!

07:09.733 --> 07:12.388
- Oh, we could get,
like, a Red Bull fountain.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.739
Ooh, or we could have,
like, a bunch of lizards there

07:15.783 --> 07:17.088
but, like,
you could get 'em high

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
and see what they do.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.702
- All I'm saying is that 21
is literally the last good age,

07:21.745 --> 07:24.487
so this party needs to be
a little elevated.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.097
Maybe a string quartet?

07:26.141 --> 07:28.273
Ooh, butter
in a sophisticated shape?

07:28.317 --> 07:30.275
- Oh.
Okay, cool.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.364
Yeah, so, like,
one of those parties

07:32.408 --> 07:34.541
with, like, wine and coats.

07:34.584 --> 07:37.282
Like, people are like,
"Oh, where do I put my coat?"

07:37.326 --> 07:38.327
and someone says,

07:38.370 --> 07:41.156
"Oh, just put it
in Donna's room."

07:41.199 --> 07:43.593
- It doesn't have to be stuffy.
Just nice.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.290
We could do
specialty cocktails.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
- Or we could tape
a fifth of Fireball

07:47.336 --> 07:48.859
to every guest's hand

07:48.903 --> 07:51.601
and then whoever finishes last
has to roll all the joints

07:51.645 --> 07:53.298
or call the hospital.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.301
- Over the years, I've learned

07:56.345 --> 07:58.521
that our customers just want
the best price,

07:58.565 --> 07:59.870
plain and simple.

07:59.914 --> 08:02.743
So if we promote
Zephra's online sales in store,

08:02.786 --> 08:05.006
that gets you
a bunch of new traffic.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.137
- Uh-huh.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.618
And what about
customers of color?

08:08.662 --> 08:10.794
Do you have any strategies
for connecting

08:10.838 --> 08:13.144
with any particular
demographic?

08:13.188 --> 08:16.321
- Um...

08:16.365 --> 08:18.019
Yeah.
Sure.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.151
Of course.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.502
As a Latina--

08:22.545 --> 08:24.504
I know that...

08:24.547 --> 08:26.767
family is very important
to our culture,

08:26.810 --> 08:30.031
so I'm thinking...

08:30.074 --> 08:33.208
shared family accounts
with distinct user profiles.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.426
- See?
Right there.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.298
That's something
we wouldn't have thought of.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.213
- Really fresh perspective.
- Yeah.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.737
I mean, all I know
is that my mom,

08:40.781 --> 08:43.044
she uses my Zephra account
for everything,

08:43.087 --> 08:45.220
and I'm just like,
"Mamá, ven acá.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.483
I have your achiote paste."

08:47.527 --> 08:50.225
It's a Honduran staple.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.269
- Oh.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.793
- Did you grow up in Honduras?

08:52.836 --> 08:55.578
- Well, um...

08:55.622 --> 08:56.840
not physically,

08:56.884 --> 08:59.582
but if you think of it
in a broader sense,

08:59.626 --> 09:03.151
like, in the cultura
that was passed down to me,

09:03.194 --> 09:05.675
then...

09:05.719 --> 09:07.372
Still no.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.855
Um, look, it's pretty obvious
that you invited me here

09:11.899 --> 09:14.554
to interview
for your resident Latina

09:14.597 --> 09:15.729
or whatever--

09:15.772 --> 09:17.078
- No, that's not what we're--
- No, no.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.601
It's more
about fresh perspectives.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.602
- Right, right.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.299
I'm qualified for this job

09:21.343 --> 09:23.432
because I have 17 years
of experience,

09:23.475 --> 09:26.566
and I know everything there is
to know about our customers,

09:26.609 --> 09:28.306
but if all you're looking for

09:28.350 --> 09:30.352
is somebody
with a spicy last name,

09:30.395 --> 09:33.485
then I suggest
you keep looking.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.140
- That's my water.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.534
- I'm sorry.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.712
- So, Tony,
Sandra is from Hawaii.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.845
- Cool.
Do you surf?

09:44.888 --> 09:46.586
- No, I've never been
to the beach.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.892
But I've seen people surfing.
Like, in pictures.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.460
- Oh!
Radical.

09:51.503 --> 09:54.506
- Hey, sorry to interrupt
your surprise adoption.

09:54.550 --> 09:55.856
- Oh, no, you missed it.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.685
They were just
getting along like gangbusters.

09:58.728 --> 10:03.124
They have so much in common,
like they're both pet lovers.

10:03.167 --> 10:06.910
Yeah, Sandra has a cat
and Tony has an aquarium.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.782
Tell her how many sharks
you have, Tony.

10:08.825 --> 10:09.913
- Three.
- Three.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.611
- Oh.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.699
What are their names?

10:12.742 --> 10:15.136
- They don't have names.
They're sharks.

10:15.179 --> 10:16.528
-  Yeah.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.834
- Obviously, we're gonna have
a red carpet area,

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
although lately,
purple's sort of having a day.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.577
- Uh-huh.
Oh, hey, Bo!

10:21.621 --> 10:22.926
- What's up, Chey?

10:22.970 --> 10:25.189
I just stopped in
to use the employee bathroom.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.278
Man, that flushes
like an airplane!

10:27.322 --> 10:28.497
'Sup, Mateo?

10:28.540 --> 10:30.281
- We're actually planning
Cheyenne's 21st.

10:30.325 --> 10:31.413
- Oh, yeah, she texted me.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.893
Said your ideas
were, like, hella lame.

10:32.936 --> 10:34.808
- Oh, not lame.

10:34.851 --> 10:35.939
Just--
- Yeah, man.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.593
She said you're,
like, all up in here

10:37.637 --> 10:39.682
trying to serve people fish
and strawberries,

10:39.726 --> 10:43.643
making it all, like,
Mozart and Amadeus and whatnot.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.645
Yo, we're just trying
to get turnt.

10:46.994 --> 10:50.171
- Well, I didn't realize
we were trying to get turnt.

10:50.214 --> 10:52.303
I can do turnt.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.479
What if we serve White Claws?

10:54.523 --> 10:55.742
- Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.482
I got an idea
that doesn't suck.

10:57.526 --> 10:58.919
How about
everybody's got roller skates

10:58.962 --> 11:01.791
and when you fall down,
you gotta take a sip.

11:01.835 --> 11:02.792
Oh, yeah.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.272
That'd be awesome.
- Yeah.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.752
- Right, right.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.842
Oh, and we could also hand out
colored wigs.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.235
- Oh, yeah.
Smart.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.280
- Yo, don't write that down.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.498
That's, like, a bad idea--

11:13.542 --> 11:15.196
oh, you're just pretending.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.110
Yeah, it's all good.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.505
- Dina, come on.
Just tell me where Amy is.

11:20.549 --> 11:21.811
- The Easter Bunny
doesn't talk.

11:21.855 --> 11:23.857
- No, I know, and that's
very convenient for her.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.119
- You're in the shot.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.948
- Okay, Janet, relax.
You're not Anne Geddes.

11:27.991 --> 11:31.342
All right, fine.
Then we will do it this way.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.954
Thank you so much.
Happy Easter.

11:33.997 --> 11:36.739
Look away, kids.

11:36.783 --> 11:37.958
Oh.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.568
Hi, Brett.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.265
What--

11:41.309 --> 11:43.311
Amy?

11:43.354 --> 11:45.835
- Oh, what, you actually
thought I'd get in that suit?

11:45.879 --> 11:47.010
I've been hiding in my truck.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.533
That thing's soaked in urine.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.105
- Every millennium
has one party that craps bombs

11:55.149 --> 11:57.368
on every other party
that millennium.

11:57.412 --> 12:02.069
This time, that party
is Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Cheyfest.

12:02.112 --> 12:06.160
Musical acts, fire eaters,
cryotherapy,

12:06.203 --> 12:08.858
a hawk, fog and foam,

12:08.902 --> 12:12.514
surprises, expected things,
diversity,

12:12.557 --> 12:14.081
and all your favorite

12:14.124 --> 12:16.823
celebrities...

12:16.866 --> 12:18.128
Cheyfest 2020.

12:18.172 --> 12:20.174
Get destroyed!

12:21.958 --> 12:23.917
- Isn't it great?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.353
- Yeah, no, I--

12:25.396 --> 12:27.529
I love that it's just
a mishmash of random stuff.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.184
You know, just weird chaos.
No theme at all.

12:30.227 --> 12:33.056
- Oh, I thought the theme was
"crap bombs on other parties."

12:33.100 --> 12:34.884
- Yeah, it is.
I said it in the video.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.277
- Yeah.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.061
- Need some glasses
for your ears now too, old man?

12:39.889 --> 12:41.238
- Okay, I love all these ideas,

12:41.282 --> 12:43.197
but how are you guys gonna get
all this stuff?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.242
- Bo can borrow
his grandma's car.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.809
- No, I mean logistically.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.942
It's just--all this stuff
you're promising sounds...

12:50.639 --> 12:53.424
Sounds super litty.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.165
- Cool.
- Yeah.

12:55.209 --> 12:58.386
- And if you want, we can also
do the fish and strawberries.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.388
- I never said
fish and strawberries.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.869
- I just think
it's a little weird

13:02.912 --> 13:04.914
that you felt you had to hide
the interview from me.

13:04.958 --> 13:07.525
- I just didn't wanna get
into some big discussion

13:07.569 --> 13:10.224
about how we do it
or what it meant.

13:10.267 --> 13:13.009
I mean, I figure I'm not
gonna get the job anyway,

13:13.053 --> 13:14.141
and I was right.

13:14.184 --> 13:15.403
I mean, I don't think
they liked it

13:15.446 --> 13:17.361
when I basically accused them
of being racist.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.581
- Yeah, well,
you're better off.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.062
- Yeah, and who wants to go
to California anyway?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.846
It's just, like,
pretentious Florida.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.108
- Ugh, totally.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.501
And the way they manage
their water resources?

13:26.544 --> 13:28.068
Get out of here, California.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.417
- And their nice weather?

13:29.460 --> 13:31.158
Just--it makes you soft.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.290
- Pass.
- Hello.

13:33.334 --> 13:34.944
Yeah, this is Amy.

13:41.559 --> 13:43.561
You got the job?

13:43.605 --> 13:46.129
I got the job.

13:46.173 --> 13:48.305
- Look, Sandra,
I gotta say something here.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.481
You know you don't have
to adopt that child--

13:50.525 --> 13:51.961
man, really,

13:52.005 --> 13:53.136
he's a full-grown man--

13:53.180 --> 13:54.964
just because
Glenn wants you to.

13:55.008 --> 13:55.965
- I just feel bad

13:56.009 --> 13:57.575
because he seems like
a good kid

13:57.619 --> 13:59.142
and he doesn't have parents,
you know?

13:59.186 --> 14:01.188
- Yeah, but he could have kids.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.364
- So what have I gotta do

14:03.407 --> 14:06.280
to put that boy into your home
today, huh?

14:06.323 --> 14:08.369
- You know, Glenn,

14:08.412 --> 14:10.414
I really, really
wanna be a mom

14:10.458 --> 14:13.635
and I'm definitely planning
to adopt,

14:13.678 --> 14:16.203
but I wasn't planning to do it
today.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.161
- Oh, no.
Of course not, no.

14:18.205 --> 14:21.599
Adoption isn't that simple.
It can be a long process.

14:21.643 --> 14:22.687
But as a first step,

14:22.731 --> 14:24.124
I was able to work
my connections

14:24.167 --> 14:25.603
with the foster agency,

14:25.647 --> 14:27.954
and they can arrange for Tony
to sleep at your house

14:27.997 --> 14:28.998
starting tonight.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.304
- Oh.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.960
It's good to have connections.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.657
- You know, Glenn,
you can't expect her

14:35.700 --> 14:38.138
to take this kid into her home
without talking to Jerry first,

14:38.181 --> 14:39.487
right, Sandra?

14:39.530 --> 14:42.272
- Yeah, I should really
discuss this with him.

14:42.316 --> 14:45.014
- Oh.
Yeah, absolutely.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.711
Why don't you call him now?

14:46.755 --> 14:47.930
- Oh, now?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.890
Um, okay.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.374
Hi.
It's me.

14:57.418 --> 15:02.162
Glenn wants us to adopt
a 17-year-old and his sharks.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.339
Uh-huh.
Three of them.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.688
Yep, you're right.

15:06.731 --> 15:07.994
I'll tell him.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.126
Thanks.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.956
He's okay with it.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.045
- Are you sure?

15:16.089 --> 15:17.612
'Cause he could have said
anything,

15:17.655 --> 15:19.309
and we wouldn't know.

15:19.353 --> 15:21.355
- Yeah.

15:21.398 --> 15:24.227
- They loved my passion
and my story.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.273
Apparently, I have a story.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.492
And they're--
they're gonna make me an offer.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.667
- That's great.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.582
So what are you gonna tell 'em?

15:31.626 --> 15:35.238
- I mean,
a high-paying corporate job

15:35.282 --> 15:36.674
where I'll never have to say

15:36.718 --> 15:40.026
the words "raccoon carcass"
again?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.679
I think I--

15:41.723 --> 15:44.073
I think I might take it.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.510
- Oh.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.991
- What?
- No, it's just I--

15:50.123 --> 15:52.081
A second ago,
you seemed so annoyed

15:52.125 --> 15:54.605
by being treated
like the token Latina.

15:54.649 --> 15:57.782
- Yeah, no, I mean--

15:57.826 --> 16:00.655
but at least they're thinking
about diversity.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.439
That's a good thing, right?

16:02.483 --> 16:05.225
- Do you even want
to work there?

16:05.268 --> 16:08.315
- Yeah.

16:08.358 --> 16:11.666
They liked my ideas,
and I think I could--

16:11.709 --> 16:13.146
I could make a difference.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.409
- For a billion-dollar
corporation?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.454
- And for the people here.

16:17.498 --> 16:20.153
- Look, I know that that's
what you want to do,

16:20.196 --> 16:23.112
I get that, but--
I mean, come on.

16:23.156 --> 16:24.635
How often does that
really happen?

16:24.679 --> 16:27.638
- So what am I supposed to do,
Jonah?

16:27.682 --> 16:30.380
Just stay the manager here
forever?

16:32.165 --> 16:35.472
I've been here for 17 years.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.126
I don't have a degree.

16:37.170 --> 16:40.173
Or, like, family connections
or, like, any other options.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.739
This is my chance.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.222
Honestly, I don't care
why they're giving me the job.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.268
It's a good job, and...

16:50.139 --> 16:51.575
I'm gonna take it.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.535
- Well, then...

16:57.581 --> 16:59.453
Congratulations.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.671
- Thanks.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.853
- Hey, Mateo,
can I ask you something

17:08.897 --> 17:10.159
and promise not to freak out?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.031
- No.
- Uh-huh.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.164
Okay, so if 500 people
bought tickets to my party,

17:15.208 --> 17:17.036
how many do you think
will actually show up?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.689
Probably, like, 30, right?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.691
- You sold 500 tickets?

17:20.735 --> 17:22.258
- My friend Chloe reposted it,

17:22.302 --> 17:24.913
so it really took off
in the foot fetish community.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.350
- Chey, this is really bad.
- Well, it's all your fault!

17:27.394 --> 17:29.700
You're supposed to be
the responsible adult

17:29.744 --> 17:31.659
who talks me out of doing
dumb stuff.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.139
- You said my ideas were lame!

17:33.182 --> 17:36.229
- They were, but mine were,
like, too good.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.100
Maybe it'll be okay though.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.362
Wait, is there a thing

17:39.406 --> 17:42.278
where if you promise something
to someone

17:42.322 --> 17:43.540
and they pay for it,

17:43.584 --> 17:45.934
you have to give them
the thing that you said?

17:45.977 --> 17:47.109
- Yes.

17:47.153 --> 17:48.893
- But, like, legally?
- Yes.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.766
- Oh, dang.
I was hoping no.

17:53.768 --> 17:54.899
- Hey.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.292
Did you hear Amy got that job?

17:56.336 --> 17:58.860
She's gonna be making
so much more money than you.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.340
- Yeah, well, she already does.

18:00.383 --> 18:03.082
- Yeah, but now she's really
running up the score.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.954
Anyway, she's gonna kill it
out in California.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.347
I mean professionally.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.653
She's gonna take a major hit
in the hotness rankings.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.960
- So you're okay
with Amy leaving?

18:12.003 --> 18:14.093
- Me?
Oh, no, I hate it.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.224
I'm gonna go home
and stress eat

18:15.268 --> 18:16.921
an entire jar of olives.

18:16.965 --> 18:19.707
But this is pretty huge
for her.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.274
- Yeah. Yeah.
It is, yeah.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.841
It's good that you're being
so supportive.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.105
I went a different direction
with it.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.672
- Really?
Come on.

18:28.716 --> 18:31.153
You're a light-boned weakling
who brings in no money.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.068
I mean, if you're not
emotional support for Amy,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.810
then what's the point of you?

18:35.853 --> 18:37.290
I mean, I've seen you drive.
That's a mess.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.814
You can't grow facial hair.
- Okay, I get it.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.120
- I think about you
holding a hammer

18:41.163 --> 18:42.251
and try not to laugh.

18:42.295 --> 18:45.080
I'm picturing it now.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.778
I wish you could see this.
You're really struggling.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.827
- So I talked to Jerry,

18:52.870 --> 18:54.698
and he said we could probably
fit your shark tank

18:54.742 --> 18:56.265
in the kitchen
if we take out the oven.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.267
- Cool.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.442
Who's Jerry?

18:59.486 --> 19:00.965
- He's your new dad.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.967
- Oh.

19:03.011 --> 19:05.187
Can we stop at Panda Express?

19:05.231 --> 19:06.797
- Sure.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.281
- Mom, stop.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.026
- Hey.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.027
What's going on here?

19:19.070 --> 19:20.333
- Some kid bit the butt

19:20.376 --> 19:22.770
off every single one
of these chocolate bunnies.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.772
Some future murderer I assume.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.166
- Oh, 100%.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.256
So I found a really great place
for you.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.388
It's, like, 10 minutes away
from Zephra,

19:32.432 --> 19:34.390
and it's right by a park
so Parker could play

19:34.434 --> 19:37.306
and you could teach Emma
to play chess.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.916
Once I teach you.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.832
Also, I found a couple options
in Menlo Park.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.312
- Jonah.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.966
- Apparently, the public
transportation is really easy.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.402
- Jonah, what is this?

19:46.446 --> 19:48.143
What are you doing?

19:48.187 --> 19:51.494
- I'm--I'm getting on board.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.453
You've got a great opportunity
here

19:53.496 --> 19:56.238
and I'm excited for you.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.458
- So you don't think
I'm selling out.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.764
- I think you're right.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.026
You gotta do this.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.115
- ♪ Fold it like a flag

20:04.159 --> 20:05.334
♪ Hold it
till the dark runs out ♪

20:05.378 --> 20:07.945
Well, I appreciate that.

20:07.989 --> 20:09.382
Because there's so much
to think about.

20:09.425 --> 20:13.255
I mean, there's the kids and--

20:13.299 --> 20:15.083
What am I gonna do
about Emma's school?

20:15.126 --> 20:19.392
And then there's this guy
that I'm seeing in St. Louis.

20:19.435 --> 20:23.091
Well, maybe...

20:23.134 --> 20:26.442
that guy you're seeing
should just...

20:26.486 --> 20:27.835
go with you.

20:30.011 --> 20:31.317
- Oh.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.796
Wow.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.494
You mean, like--

20:34.537 --> 20:37.497
like, he would just move
to California?

20:37.540 --> 20:38.498
For me?

20:38.541 --> 20:40.151
- Yeah, I mean, well--

20:40.195 --> 20:41.501
you know, why should you
be the only one

20:41.544 --> 20:43.894
who gets a taste
of that sweet public transpo?

20:43.938 --> 20:46.462
- Yeah, but their water
resource management is--

20:46.506 --> 20:47.942
- I can overlook it.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.031
- ♪ You find yourself
holding on ♪

20:50.074 --> 20:51.119
- Okay.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.035
Yeah.

20:54.078 --> 20:57.125
Let's--let's move to California
together.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.300
- ♪ You find yourself
holding on ♪

20:58.344 --> 21:00.911
- Let's do it.

21:00.955 --> 21:02.304
And just to be clear,

21:02.348 --> 21:05.089
when you say "this guy
you're dating in St. Louis,"

21:05.133 --> 21:07.309
that's me, right, because
if you're seeing somebody else,

21:07.353 --> 21:08.919
I'd prefer he not come with us.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.443
- ♪ Holding on

21:13.533 --> 21:15.883
Okay.
I was just--just checking.

21:15.926 --> 21:19.452
- ♪ Let your heart

21:19.495 --> 21:23.282
