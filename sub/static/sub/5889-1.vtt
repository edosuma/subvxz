WEBVTT

00:38.539 --> 00:40.075
Yeah!

00:43.544 --> 00:44.750
Yeah!

01:03.814 --> 01:05.600
Yeah!

01:05.942 --> 01:07.807
Yeah!

01:15.952 --> 01:17.783
Oh, my stars.

01:17.954 --> 01:21.117
Is that how you cope
with this insufferable humidity?

01:21.290 --> 01:22.279
I couldn't do it.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.915
-We had an agreement.
-We did.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.919
I told you if I found you
in my territory again, I'd kill you.

01:28.089 --> 01:30.922
Tell the boy not to pull
on the brim of the hat.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.670
What's in the box?

01:33.844 --> 01:36.051
I've come to propose
a business transaction.

01:36.222 --> 01:38.759
No, we have no business. The box.

01:47.066 --> 01:50.308
Typically, l steer clear
of tin-pot dictators...

01:50.486 --> 01:54.946
...who employ boy soldiers,
but I'm afraid this situation is unique.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.744
Well, now you're being short-sighted.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.496
Tell him to put the gun down.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.008
I'm glad to know you're a man
of decisive action.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.714
You see, Yabaari...

02:17.888 --> 02:21.676
...you didn't actually find me,
I found you.

02:21.851 --> 02:25.184
And while your prepubescent ruffians
may not know it...

02:25.354 --> 02:29.518
...they brought me here to strike a deal
that could benefit all of us.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.690
What kind of deal?

02:36.198 --> 02:39.326
A man calling himself Berlin
hired a bounty hunter...

02:39.493 --> 02:41.654
...to find me and my associates.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.162
That bounty worked for you.
I've since dispatched of him...

02:45.333 --> 02:48.496
...but if Berlin hired one bounty hunter,
he hired five.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.205
I want their names.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.165
I'm willing to pay 3 million.

02:52.340 --> 02:56.629
We do need to move quickly, though.
You have 30 seconds.

02:56.802 --> 02:58.417
Or what?

02:58.596 --> 03:00.928
Or you give me the names for free.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.847
We really should act swiftly.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.183
We really should kill you
and keep your money.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.395
Now, there's a point of view
that I can relate to.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.693
Yabaari, look at me.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.399
Give me what I want, or so help me God,
I'll make it rain fire on you.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.868
Kill him.

03:28.959 --> 03:33.248
Funny thing, I recently acquired
three Hellfire missiles...

03:33.422 --> 03:35.378
...at a considerable discount.

03:35.591 --> 03:39.209
If you give me what I want,
I can still call off the other two.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.379
-But I'll need to borrow your phone.
-I know nothing.

03:43.057 --> 03:46.766
I think you do, Yabaari.
I think you've heard things.

03:46.936 --> 03:50.428
Who else has Berlin hired to hunt me?

03:50.981 --> 03:54.519
-The Cuban, Orci.
-|'ve dealt with Orci. Who else?

03:54.693 --> 03:56.069
I told you, I don't know!

03:59.824 --> 04:03.783
Okay. It's okay. There was someone.
I can't remember his name.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.318
They call him something.

04:05.496 --> 04:09.159
The Prince, the Lord....

04:10.459 --> 04:11.835
Lord Baltimore.

04:23.139 --> 04:25.346
Fetch the water!
What are you doing?

04:25.516 --> 04:27.472
Go, go.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.319
He burned it?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.408
Are you kidding me? $3 million?

04:50.583 --> 04:53.620
-We understand he has a lead.
-Reddington has had lots of leads...

04:53.794 --> 04:56.410
...the past two months.
HUMINT was supposed to help us...

04:56.589 --> 05:00.582
...in our search for this.... We still don't
even know what this Berlin's real name is.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.593
One thing we do know is that the FBI
has allowed its number four...

05:04.763 --> 05:08.506
...to hand out 12 million in untraceable,
black-bag cash to his friends.

05:08.684 --> 05:11.471
That money was used for local intel.
I'm confident Redding—

05:11.645 --> 05:14.933
That money has people on the
intelligence committee asking questions.

05:15.107 --> 05:18.565
The actions that concern you
were approved by my predecessor.

05:18.736 --> 05:20.943
Now, I don't want to criticize
Harold Cooper...

05:21.113 --> 05:25.231
...and | wish him a speedy recovery,
but as interim director of this task force...

05:25.409 --> 05:28.492
...I can assure you the situation
is under control.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.778
I am the deputy attorney general.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.698
If I say I want to talk to Reddington...

05:33.876 --> 05:35.332
...| talk to Reddington.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.368
That's great, but we have a thing here.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.871
Reddington only talks
with Elizabeth Keen.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.937
-Did you take a different route?
-Justice is freaking out.

06:47.116 --> 06:50.028
-Change your hotel?
-Hellfire missiles?

06:50.202 --> 06:53.114
-Seriously?
-Life is far too important a thing...

06:53.289 --> 06:55.575
...ever to talk seriously about.

06:55.749 --> 07:00.038
Martin won't protect the task force. He
doesn't care that Berlin is still targeting us.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.123
And without Cooper
to defend our actions--

07:02.298 --> 07:05.836
People love to decry
Big Brother, the NSA...

07:06.010 --> 07:09.252
...the government listening in
on their most private lives.

07:09.430 --> 07:12.263
Yet they all willingly go online
and hand over...

07:12.433 --> 07:15.425
...the most intimate details
of those lives to big data.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.436
Most people don't care that Google
knows their search history.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.689
They know more than that. They know
your habits. The banks you use.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.601
The pills you pop.
The men or women you sleep with.

07:24.778 --> 07:28.270
Every piece of information
is worth something to somebody.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.941
And in the hands of the wrong person,
that could be deadly.

07:32.870 --> 07:36.328
-You have a lead.
-Lord Baltimore is in town.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.206
-Lord Baltimore?
-He's a tracker by trade...

07:39.376 --> 07:41.412
...but his methods
are thoroughly modern.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.873
He's made an art of combing
through cyberspace...

07:44.048 --> 07:46.664
...finding the status updates...

07:46.842 --> 07:49.834
...financial records
and location blips...

07:50.012 --> 07:52.719
...that virtually everyone leaves behind
in the modern age.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.755
-And he has a new target?
-Yes.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.059
Me.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.551
Follow this, Lizzy.
It's our first lead.

07:58.729 --> 08:03.189
If we find Lord Baltimore,
he may very well point us to Berlin.

08:10.908 --> 08:13.991
Berlin has hired a skiptracer
who calls himself Lord Baltimore.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.493
Two months, and Reddington
brings a bounty hunter?

08:16.664 --> 08:18.825
More than a bounty hunter.
He's a statistician.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.162
Even less impressive. What does he do,
find them with a slide ruler?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.793
No. With data analytics.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.000
-You've heard of this guy.
-Yeah.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.789
Lord Baltimore is an urban legend.

08:28.967 --> 08:32.380
They say he roams the Deep Web
hunting those who don't wish to be found...

08:32.554 --> 08:37.048
...uses algorithms to build a dossier based
on the information people give away.

08:37.226 --> 08:41.060
He's a data miner. Aram, can you pull up
that file you showed me?

08:42.439 --> 08:46.227
Rowan Mills. She works as a data
engineer at QuanCord Analytics.

08:46.402 --> 08:50.896
Keen asked me to look for irregularities in
the accounts of employees at data firms.

08:51.073 --> 08:54.065
I found several,
but this was especially odd.

08:54.243 --> 08:57.906
A $250,000 payment
that went into Mills' IRA.

08:58.080 --> 09:01.038
Thirty seconds later,
it shot out to an offshore account.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.325
Yes, $250,000
was deposited into my IRA.

09:04.503 --> 09:08.337
But as soon as I saw that, I changed
my passwords and I reported it.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.338
I'm telling you, I'm the victim here.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.795
This wasn't the first time
you were targeted?

09:12.970 --> 09:15.712
-There was an incident in August.
-What kind of an incident?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.380
-Someone accessed my systems.
-Looking for what?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.392
-Bank accounts? Credit card numbers?
-Impossible to know...

09:21.562 --> 09:24.269
...because the data we gather
has no limits.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.681
They were looking for someone
who doesn't want to be found.

09:26.859 --> 09:29.020
Could the data that was taken
help them do that?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.685
Yes. That's what we do.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.822
Did you hear what she said?

09:35.993 --> 09:38.609
-You're being paranoid.
-How easy it is to track someone?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.652
Ijust feel like...

09:40.831 --> 09:44.699
-...I don't know, someone is watching me.
-That why you're living out of your trunk?

09:44.877 --> 09:46.788
Those motels? The aliases?

09:46.962 --> 09:48.793
You got to stop doing that, Keen.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.170
Tom's dead.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.254
You talk to Dr. Friedman yet?

09:54.887 --> 09:57.299
-Don't change the subject.
-The visits are mandatory.

09:57.473 --> 10:00.715
Look, the Bureau isn't interested
in our mental health.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.760
They've assigned a shrink
to talk to us to cover their asses...

10:03.937 --> 10:06.849
...in case one of us wigs out,
but that ain't gonna be me.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.265
You're too healthy
to talk to a shrink?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.025
I talk to you all the time.
Aren't you board-certified?

10:12.196 --> 10:13.857
Yeah.

10:14.031 --> 10:18.240
And in my professional opinion,
I think you need to talk to Dr. Friedman.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.074
He here?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.345
Lord Baltimore has found Reddington.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.269
The extraction
will take place tomorrow.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.225
But the feds are involved now.

10:49.566 --> 10:54.060
That complicates things.
There will be additional expenses.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.149
What?

11:10.254 --> 11:14.588
I said no additional expenses.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.966
You deliver Reddington to me
within 24 hours...

11:18.178 --> 11:21.261
...or we take another bath.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.099
You have one new message.

11:26.270 --> 11:31.264
Hello, Rowan. [know about that
little chat you had today with the FBI.

11:31.441 --> 11:35.104
So I'm going to make this
real simple for you.

11:35.279 --> 11:39.192
I’m warning you,
do not talk to them again.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.357
[know where you live.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.573
-This person calls you by name.
-I don't know. It could be anyone.

11:49.751 --> 11:52.538
-It's as if they know you.
-What about the apartment?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.829
Believe there might be
something missing?

11:55.007 --> 11:57.293
You think someone's been in here?

11:58.427 --> 12:01.009
Hey, perfect timing.
I'm gonna need you to trace a call.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.010
Okay, great,
but I have something.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.388
Our suspect, Mills,
she's telling the truth.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.175
Security at QuanCord
conﬁrmed her terminal was hacked...

12:08.353 --> 12:10.605
-...from the outside.
-Any idea what was taken?

12:10.772 --> 12:13.514
Yeah, a gajillion bytes of online data
which makes no sense.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.432
-Why?
-Mr. Reddington's a Luddite.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.523
No e-mail, no computer.
No digital communication of any kind.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.154
Dembe uses disposable
flip phones for God's sakes.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.567
Why would Berlin hire
Lord Baltimore to track him?

12:26.580 --> 12:27.615
Unless....

12:28.582 --> 12:31.540
You think they might be
looking for one of us?

12:34.546 --> 12:37.333
Not a day goes by
where I don't think about Agent Malik.

12:37.633 --> 12:40.750
-Me too.
-What number do you need me to trace?

12:40.928 --> 12:43.886
Rowan Mills received a message
last night. I need a location.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.811
-Out of the way.
-Clear!

13:06.620 --> 13:08.326
Ressler.

13:10.415 --> 13:13.532
Let's get Mills in here.
I wanna see how she reacts to this.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.749
-What is this place?
-This way.

13:38.694 --> 13:42.152
-So, what aren't you telling us?
-Nothing.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.814
Your name is on the lease. We know you
use the screen handle Lord Baltimore.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.449
-Who?
-The same data hacked...

13:47.619 --> 13:50.031
...from your work terminal
is on the laptop we found.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.787
You stealing data for Berlin
to find Raymond Reddington?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.994
I don't know
any Raymond Reddington.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.160
I have never set foot in this place
before in my life.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.636
Hello, Harold.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.802
Please apologize to Charlene...

14:10.976 --> 14:13.558
...your side gate
may need a new lock.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.521
A get-well present.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.691
It looks so soft.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.943
Shea butter?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.316
Is this what I think it is?

14:29.453 --> 14:31.865
When are you coming back to work?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.154
I'm not.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.740
Things are at a tipping point, Harold.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.375
Your replacement
has the unfortunate distinction...

14:39.546 --> 14:42.037
...of being both untrustworthy
and incompetent.

14:42.215 --> 14:45.298
I've informed the Bureau.
It's time to be with my family.

14:45.969 --> 14:49.427
Charlene's from the Dominican. I've
promised we'd spend more time there.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.179
I hate sand.

14:51.600 --> 14:55.058
-If this is some kind of threat--
-It's not a threat, Harold. It's a bribe.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.642
That is my only copy
of our little adventure in Kuwait.

14:59.816 --> 15:04.276
I'm giving it to you only to underscore
the urgency of our situation.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.402
I'm not coming back.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.656
You need to get back on your feet.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.363
There's no shame in being a cripple.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.660
I'll remember you to Charlene.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.702
I know what they found
while you were at the hospital.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.371
I know about the diagnosis.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.310
Let's get the job done.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.396
I mean, you gotta do better than that.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.860
It's the only possible explanation.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.773
And this Nora.... She died?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.407
In Mosul, seven years ago.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.569
But if what you're saying is true...

15:55.747 --> 15:59.956
...if all of this is real,
then it's the only explanation.

16:00.335 --> 16:03.122
My twin sister is alive.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.051
Nice to have you back, Mr. Howe.
Your rib eye is on its way...

16:16.226 --> 16:18.888
...along with a complimentary
bottle of '82 Margaux.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.348
-Thank you.
-You sure you want to take the stairs?

16:21.523 --> 16:23.639
Doctor's orders. We'll be fine.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.023
I don't remember him.
Find out who he is.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.571
And put two more men
on detail downstairs.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.071
You hear that?

16:39.833 --> 16:40.822
Get down!

16:53.805 --> 16:56.217
Let's go. Take him to the roof.

17:20.874 --> 17:24.913
Lord Baltimore,
aren't you a surprisingly saucy minx?

17:31.885 --> 17:33.045
Unbelievable.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.461
I'm sorry, who is it exactly
that you think I am?

17:35.639 --> 17:37.004
You're Mossad.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.594
Don't tell me this is about
that dust-up in Haifa.

17:39.768 --> 17:43.306
That "dust-up" claimed the lives
of two agents and a Turkish diplomat.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.811
A diplomat?

17:46.024 --> 17:48.606
-I had nothing to do with it.
-Then you have nothing to worry about.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.110
Oh, you have no idea
how I wish that were true.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.067
I have tens of thousands of things
to worry about.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.699
Fortunately, you, my dear,
are not one of them.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.155
-And why is that?
-The person you just informed...

18:00.330 --> 18:03.037
...of my capture is going to release me
within the hour.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.456
Aren't we confident today?

18:05.627 --> 18:07.618
I'm confident every day.

18:08.546 --> 18:10.832
And I thought
we had nothing in common.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.094
-I have no idea what that goes to.
-It was found in your apartment.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.304
I've never set foot in that place before.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.139
Let's talk about your sister.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.521
Now, this is Rowan
and Nora's on the left.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.308
Rowan was my first child
by three minutes.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.522
How could you tell them apart?

18:33.697 --> 18:36.939
Rowan was a silly-heart,
always smiling.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.823
She was a happy child.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.825
And Nora?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.286
She was complicated.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.323
She was molested
by our uncle Rick...

18:46.501 --> 18:48.992
...from the time we were 7
until about 12 or so.

18:49.170 --> 18:52.708
I didn't believe her, nobody did.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.793
Everybody just went on
like nothing happened.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.004
-Everybody but--
-Nora.

18:57.178 --> 19:01.342
Nora had problems. She hated me,
hated our mom. She hated everybody.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.724
After that, she was lost.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.843
Didn't fit in.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.392
I thought her getting that job
with that company...

19:10.567 --> 19:13.980
...that security firm, it really was
the best thing she could do.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.271
Nora. That girl, she was fearless.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.280
First one in, last one out.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.533
If the boys on my crew
had a pair like her...

19:21.703 --> 19:24.035
...you could crown me king,
take the afternoon off.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.240
She pressured you? How?

19:25.415 --> 19:29.203
She wanted me to use my position at
work to try to get information on people...

19:29.377 --> 19:30.992
...at a competing security firm.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.332
Stuff that she could use
to get the upper hand.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.122
And when you refused,
she hit you.

19:38.553 --> 19:41.920
She flew out the next morning,
and three weeks later, she was killed.

19:42.098 --> 19:45.135
Her team was tasked with
clearing hostiles out of Ad Dawr.

19:45.310 --> 19:49.599
Lead truck got taken out by an IED.
They came under heavy insurgent fire.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.559
We lost all four operatives that day.

19:51.733 --> 19:55.521
-Says here her body was never recovered.
-That's true. She was taken.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.440
-Taken?
-Well, they took her.

19:58.615 --> 20:03.154
-And did God knows what with that girl.
-So you never recovered her body?

20:03.328 --> 20:06.365
-I don't believe she's still alive.
-But there is a chance she is.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.497
That's why you're releasing me,
you think she's still out there.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.828
-Yes.
-But what if she comes after me?

20:12.003 --> 20:14.585
-What if she comes after our mother?
-We can't hold you.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.712
We have no probable cause.

20:17.425 --> 20:22.510
Your younger brother Shahin was killed
in the 2009 Pishin bombing.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.093
-In Farsi, Shahin means--
-Falcon.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.559
-How did you know?
-I know everything about people...

20:29.729 --> 20:31.469
...who are tasked with finding me.

20:31.981 --> 20:34.518
Your turn. How did you do it?

20:34.692 --> 20:37.274
You possess an affinity
for Zegna ties.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.152
-So do millions of other men.
-Thousands, actually.

20:40.323 --> 20:41.984
At least in the northeast corridor.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.366
Nonetheless, this sample was far
too broad to be of any practical use.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.153
We couldn't help but notice
that you lean toward...

20:48.331 --> 20:51.823
...a darker earth-tone palette,
chocolate and oxblood...

20:52.001 --> 20:54.492
...geometric shapes,
rarely stripes.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.663
We introduced a diblock copolymer
nanoparticle marker...

20:57.841 --> 21:00.332
...into the brown dye
in their factory in Novara...

21:00.510 --> 21:03.343
...which supplies all the vendors
on the Eastern Seaboard.

21:03.513 --> 21:08.007
Effectively turning every earth-toned
Zegna tie into a homing device.

21:08.184 --> 21:11.597
Brilliant. Just like a bloodhound.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.978
Agent Ressler.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.607
Sorry, Dr. Friedman, but we're
in the middle of an investigation.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.814
You do know I could suspend you
pending assessment.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.355
We identified the key you found
in Mills' apartment.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.149
Lab says it belongs to a van,
a '77 G-Series van.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.902
Tell Keen I went to pay
the mother another visit.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.456
Agent Ressler.

21:30.623 --> 21:31.954
Hey, I got something.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.870
I got something.
Okay, so the collection algorithms...

21:35.044 --> 21:36.705
-...that Lord Baltimore uses?
-Yeah.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.168
I applied them to the data he hacked,
and I think I see how he does it.

21:40.341 --> 21:44.209
It's amazing. He's using personal details
about his target's life...

21:44.387 --> 21:46.298
...to create markers
to narrow his search.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.590
So he's looking for someone
who lived in DC. before 1990...

21:49.767 --> 21:52.053
...has a prescription
for Lipitor through Medco...

21:52.228 --> 21:55.641
...downloads World War II
documentaries on Netflix, not Amazon...

21:55.815 --> 21:58.932
...and has a digital subscription to both
The Wall Street Journal...

21:59.110 --> 22:02.193
-...and Cat Fanatic.
-He has a subscription to Cat Fanatic?

22:02.363 --> 22:06.527
No. Turns out Lord Baltimore's
not looking for Mr. Reddington.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.911
Your suspect's been remanded
into my custody.

22:12.081 --> 22:14.072
This references a task force.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.162
-What task force?
-It's a matter of national security.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.761
Perhaps next time.

22:31.893 --> 22:34.555
Keen wants you
to take a look at these.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.012
Ms. Navabi.

22:39.734 --> 22:43.352
Jundallah claimed responsibility
for the bomb that killed your brother.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.316
They had nothing to do with it.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.106
I can give you the name
of the man who did.

22:49.077 --> 22:53.821
Walid Abu Sitta. Disappeared
from his hotel room in Jiyeh last May.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.989
Police are baffled.

22:56.501 --> 22:57.707
Are they?

23:02.549 --> 23:05.962
What the hell is going on? Martin
said you were extracted by Mossad?

23:06.135 --> 23:08.091
We'll discuss later.
What am I looking at?

23:08.263 --> 23:12.302
Targets. Turns out Berlin didn't
contract Lord Baltimore to find you.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.261
-He's looking for a woman.
-What woman?

23:14.435 --> 23:16.471
We 're not sure.
We only know her proﬁle.

23:16.646 --> 23:19.513
Aram was able to narrow the search,
but that still leaves us...

23:19.691 --> 23:21.556
with over 200 potential targets.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.897
-Naomi Hyland.
-Who? Who's Naomi Hyland?

23:25.071 --> 23:28.234
You need to get a unit to her right now.
She's in protective custody.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.990
-I don't understand. How do you know--
-Listen, Lizzy.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.151
Berlin is coming for this woman.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.742
-You have to move now.
-Why? Who the hell is Naomi Hyland?

23:40.128 --> 23:41.538
She was my wife.

23:45.216 --> 23:48.208
-I never said that.
-You said you don't believe in God.

23:48.386 --> 23:50.752
If you don't believe in God,
then you're an atheist.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.012
-You're an atheist.
-You can be an atheist...

23:53.182 --> 23:56.310
...and believe in a higher power.
For me, that power is shopping.

23:56.477 --> 24:00.220
-Yeah, my credit card bills prove that.
-You know what I believe in?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.438
-Naomi.
-|'|| drink to that.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.435
-I think we need more wine.
-Yes, please.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.618
Honey, what was the name of the lodge
in the Alleghenies?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.958
You remember, the one
with the fireplace and the moose head.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.424
What's going on?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.882
-I'm sorry.
-What are you talking about?

24:34.057 --> 24:36.218
U.S. marshals. Everyone stay calm.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.350
What is this?
What are you doing in my house?

24:39.937 --> 24:41.552
-Naomi!
-Mrs. Hyland...

24:41.731 --> 24:45.144
...I need you to come with me now.
We have a credible threat.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.479
He's back, isn't he?

25:03.586 --> 25:05.167
Hey, it's me. It's Marcus.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.162
-You know why I'm here.
-Don't come any closer.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.883
I'm not here to hurt you.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.846
Just relax.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.507
I want you to hear this.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.322
Take your time.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.276
You're okay.

25:46.587 --> 25:48.123
You know who you are...

25:49.465 --> 25:50.716
...who I am.

25:58.808 --> 26:00.514
You shouldn't be here.

26:00.685 --> 26:02.050
You can't come here like this.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.307
No! No! No! You--

26:05.481 --> 26:07.938
It's starting to come back now,
isn't it?

26:08.109 --> 26:11.522
You need a warrant. My daughter,
she told me not to let anyone back here.

26:11.696 --> 26:13.561
No! If she finds out--

26:13.740 --> 26:15.355
Oh, my God! No, no.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.155
I hate to remind you
of what happened on Fullerton...

26:19.328 --> 26:23.287
...but you know, don't you?

26:25.334 --> 26:27.461
You remember.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.428
How long was I gone?

26:48.733 --> 26:51.270
Keen, Ijust found Nora Mills' body.

26:51.444 --> 26:54.811
I don't know, either Rowan
is the greatest liar in the world...

26:54.989 --> 26:57.731
...or some kind of split happened.
Give me a call back.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.321
Mrs. Hyland, it's important
we move quickly.

27:00.495 --> 27:05.910
You think I'm gonna run?
Just walk away and start over again?

27:06.083 --> 27:08.244
You and I both know
that's where this is going.

27:08.419 --> 27:11.252
-Mrs. Hyland.
-I'm not going anywhere.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.294
-Nobody said anything about cops.
-It's fine.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.134
-Well, it don't look fine.
-I said it's fine.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.595
Hey, look at me. We've been over this.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.761
Do your damn job.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.889
Move on my signal.

27:31.067 --> 27:34.434
I had a life, you know?

27:34.612 --> 27:38.480
My daughter had a life
with a house and a dog.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.774
And then I woke up one day....

27:41.953 --> 27:45.537
You can't imagine what it's like to have
a man like Raymond Reddington...

27:45.706 --> 27:48.083
...turn your life upside down.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.867
They accused me of being a part of it.

27:51.045 --> 27:52.831
Somehow, I was a suspect.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.496
Put my life under a microscope...

27:55.675 --> 27:58.712
...every call, every charge.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.717
My assets were....

28:01.556 --> 28:03.763
I finally convinced them I was innocent.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.924
They said I had to go.

28:06.310 --> 28:07.425
Give up everything.

28:08.145 --> 28:09.976
I remember it was
a Wednesday afternoon.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.229
My daughter wasn't even
out of school yet.

28:12.400 --> 28:18.191
And by Thursday, we were
in Philadelphia, fending for ourselves.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.024
We need to talk to your wife.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.280
You're gonna have to tell him.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.606
We can be ready in 20 minutes.

28:55.776 --> 28:57.767
Okay, I'll let them know.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.196
Get down. Shots fired!

29:07.705 --> 29:08.785
I need backup!

30:03.135 --> 30:04.636
What are you doing?

30:08.766 --> 30:12.133
Dembe, put him on.
I found Lord Baltimore.

30:38.546 --> 30:40.252
Hello...

30:41.966 --> 30:44.378
...Mrs. Reddington.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.304
-Where is she?
-|'ve already told you.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.842
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-You are Lord Baltimore.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.639
You were paid by a man who calls
himself Berlin to extract Naomi Hyland.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.477
I need to know,
where was she taken?

31:00.651 --> 31:03.734
I'm gonna ask you again.
Naomi Hyland.

31:04.280 --> 31:07.363
I don't know why you're talking to me.
Nora put this together.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.194
A woman's life is in jeopardy here.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.108
I need Nora to tell me where she is.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.779
-Then find her. Ask Nora!
-I am asking her!

31:15.541 --> 31:17.998
You're the expert,
but from where I sit...

31:18.169 --> 31:19.750
...this is the perfect setup.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.831
One personality
hiding behind the other...

31:22.006 --> 31:24.622
...able to commit a crime
and yet have no memory of it.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.381
That's not exactly how it works.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.760
-Rowan passed the lie detector test.
-Because Rowan's unaware of Nora.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.261
Nora's unaware of Rowan.

31:31.432 --> 31:33.923
That's how dissociative
identity disorder works.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.308
The two can't conspire.

31:36.479 --> 31:39.971
Well, then we're screwed because
we have Rowan and we need Nora.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.231
What we need to do
is identify the trigger.

31:42.401 --> 31:46.235
The image, sound, memory
that flips her switch.

31:48.824 --> 31:52.408
Of course. It's him.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.782
You were at her apartment.
You're in her photos.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.540
What are you,
some kind of handler?

32:01.337 --> 32:03.123
I'm nobody.

32:08.302 --> 32:11.009
-She runs everything.
-With your help.

32:11.305 --> 32:12.886
You're manipulating her.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.218
You're looking at a life in prison.

32:15.392 --> 32:18.520
Cooperate and maybe
we can make a deal.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.514
Tell me about her trigger.

32:28.239 --> 32:29.479
You know...

32:30.783 --> 32:32.148
...I think you were right.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.868
I think Nora survived
that incident in Mosul.

32:36.413 --> 32:41.203
I think she escaped,
came home and killed Rowan.

32:45.172 --> 32:46.628
That's impossible.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.633
Nora killed Rowan
because she envied her.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.176
She wanted to become her.

32:52.346 --> 32:56.385
She wanted to be the good sister, the
sister who didn't get abused by her uncle.

32:56.559 --> 32:57.765
You're lying.

32:57.935 --> 33:00.176
Nobody murdered Rowan. I'm Rowan.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.265
No. Rowan is dead.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.566
You murdered your sister,
didn't you, Nora?

33:04.733 --> 33:07.190
That's what caused the split,
the trauma and guilt.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.602
No. |-- I'm Rowan Mills.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.873
It was playing that night, wasn't it?

33:29.758 --> 33:33.751
Do you remember
how it felt that night?

33:35.306 --> 33:37.763
Do you remember
what you were feeling, Nora...

33:37.933 --> 33:40.310
...when you killed your sister?

33:47.151 --> 33:49.358
It's over, Nora.

33:49.612 --> 33:50.977
Marcus cut a deal.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.693
Tell me where you took
Naomi Hyland.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.738
-We got here too late.
-Describe the scene.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.242
It's bloody.

34:06.420 --> 34:09.002
Lord Baltimore's men,
they're all dead.

34:09.465 --> 34:12.002
-All but one, I don't think--
-Let me speak with him.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.132
-What? Why?
-Because he didn't survive.

34:14.303 --> 34:18.012
He was left alive to deliver a message,
and it won't be to you, it's for me.

34:18.182 --> 34:20.514
Wait, wait, wait.

34:22.978 --> 34:26.766
The man with one hand,
what did he instruct you to say?

34:26.941 --> 34:29.899
The Bluejay, on Benning Road.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.066
Number 604.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.746
If you're looking for him,
I can't help you.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.794
You have to listen to me.
Reddington, I haven't--

34:53.968 --> 34:56.004
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

34:59.932 --> 35:02.594
I need you to lay down.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.510
No, please. Please, I'm begging you.

35:05.688 --> 35:08.430
-I can't help you.
-I don't want your help!

35:31.338 --> 35:33.454
It's nice.

35:35.926 --> 35:37.962
Hold still.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.767
You should let me go in first.

37:29.706 --> 37:32.618
I talked to Reddington.
He couldn't find her.

37:32.793 --> 37:34.374
A win's a win.

37:34.545 --> 37:38.037
Lord Baltimore's off the street.
Did I hear right?

37:38.465 --> 37:41.002
Was Reddington detained
by some Mossad agent?

37:41.176 --> 37:44.339
Yeah. Apparently, Martin
had to negotiate his release.

37:44.513 --> 37:48.426
Well, any agent who can track down
Reddington, I'm buying them a beer.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.512
Congratulations. I heard you captured
the man you were after.

37:51.687 --> 37:56.807
I thought maybe now we could go over
a couple things, maybe take stock.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.395
Agent Ressler.

38:05.242 --> 38:07.608
I will recommend you for suspension.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.574
I don't mean to be a prick here, but I'm
not sure what you think you're gonna fix.

38:11.748 --> 38:14.956
-Yeah, I'm not sure either, until we talk.
-About what?

38:15.127 --> 38:18.244
Those agents who died today?
About the fact that we lost a woman...

38:18.422 --> 38:21.960
...that we were supposed to protect?
How do I feel about that?

38:22.134 --> 38:24.341
I feel like crap.

38:24.845 --> 38:27.552
But I know the good we do here,
why it matters.

38:27.723 --> 38:30.965
Am I worried that some day
it's not gonna be enough?

38:31.143 --> 38:32.553
Yeah.

38:34.188 --> 38:36.930
And when that day comes,
you'll be the first to know.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.952
Elizabeth, the judge signed it.

38:52.122 --> 38:55.660
May be of little solace, but he granted
your application for the annulment.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.120
As far as the District of Columbia
is concerned...

38:58.295 --> 39:01.128
...you were never married
to Thomas Keen.

39:02.758 --> 39:06.592
It's none of my business,
but I noticed you're keeping his name.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.302
My husband...

39:12.601 --> 39:17.061
...was an imposter, a fake.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.475
Keen was never his name.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.603
What now?

40:20.586 --> 40:24.875
Hey, why are you all smiles?

40:25.674 --> 40:27.710
Guess who's no longer
interim director.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.260
What? Martin, he's gone?

40:30.137 --> 40:32.128
Well, who do we answer to now?

40:32.306 --> 40:34.046
That would be me.

40:39.563 --> 40:41.349
What are you waiting on, Agent Keen?

40:41.523 --> 40:44.014
Tell me where are we with Berlin.

40:53.201 --> 40:56.159
This was left at the front desk
for Mr. Hirschfeld.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.870
Raymond.

41:06.298 --> 41:08.038
You want me to open it?

41:08.634 --> 41:10.545
No, I got it.

41:26.193 --> 41:29.685
Mr. Reddington, lpresume.

41:30.530 --> 41:35.445
-Where is she?
-Oh, here and there, out and about.

41:35.619 --> 41:36.904
You know women.

41:38.497 --> 41:41.489
I can only imagine how dearly
you must be missing her...

41:41.667 --> 41:44.033
...after all these years, huh?

41:44.211 --> 41:47.954
So I made you a little something
to remember her by.

41:48.131 --> 41:52.090
You see,
I'm gonna do to your wife...

41:52.260 --> 41:53.761
...what you did to my daughter.

41:54.471 --> 41:57.087
I’m gonna send her back to you...

41:57.766 --> 42:00.382
piece by piece...

42:00.977 --> 42:02.763
...by piece.
