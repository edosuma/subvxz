NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.169 --> 00:06.900
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:06.973 --> 00:08.031
In New York City,

00:08.108 --> 00:11.043
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.111 --> 00:14.672
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:14.748 --> 00:16.716
These are their stories,

00:16.883 --> 00:17.941
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:18.018 --> 00:19.747
Tina, wait a sec.
I'm out.

00:19.819 --> 00:23.482
What do you want me to do?
You've done enough.

00:23.556 --> 00:26.684
I can't believe
you're making this up.
I saw you, Malcolm.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.557
You checked her out,
and then you got her number.

00:28.628 --> 00:31.062
No, I didn't.
Empty your pockets.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.395
Come on.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.360
Hey, get out of here.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.505
Sorry, man.

00:42.142 --> 00:44.702
Malcolm, get out of the way.
You can get your coat Iater.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.406
There was someone
on the bed. Now move!

00:50.517 --> 00:52.542
MALCOLM: Dude went out
the window.

00:57.490 --> 00:59.583
5'10" to 6', buck 90.

00:59.726 --> 01:04.322
Between 30 and 40 years old,
dark brown hair, brown eyes.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.763
Any distinguishing marks?
No.

01:06.833 --> 01:08.425
How'd you see all that?

01:08.501 --> 01:12.028
You only had
a couple of seconds,
and it was dark.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.801
We've been examining
eyewitness testimony
in mock court.

01:14.874 --> 01:18.275
Most of the time
it's unreliable, and that's
why I wrote it all down.

01:18.344 --> 01:20.904
You a Iaw student?
Third year, NYU.

01:20.980 --> 01:23.107
You find him, I can ID him.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.782
There's plenty of semen
and foreign hairs present.

01:28.855 --> 01:31.722
She still out of it?
Tox screen
is positive for opiates.

01:31.791 --> 01:35.591
There are needle marks
between her toes
and her upper thighs.

01:36.663 --> 01:37.994
When can I talk to her?

01:38.064 --> 01:40.464
In a while. I gave her some
Narcan to wake her up.

01:40.533 --> 01:44.230
Detective, we have a problem
with the rape victim.

01:44.304 --> 01:45.362
No ID?

01:45.438 --> 01:49.670
No, we know who she is,
but I found something
in her purse.

01:52.712 --> 01:55.044
What the hell is this?
A finger?

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.096 --> 02:46.930
Does anybody know why
our rape victim was carrying
a human body part?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.627
Fin's at the hospital
waiting to ask.

02:48.701 --> 02:51.295
Name's CIaire Rinato,
a 29-year-old heroin addict.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.669
She's unemployed.
She Iives across the river.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.208
Well, we know what
she was doing in the city?

02:56.276 --> 02:57.265
Probably scoring.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.801
She was arrested Iast year
for drug possession
and resisting.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.508
It was bumped to a
misdemeanor probation
and court-ordered rehab.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.984
Yeah. Her maternal
grandmother, Rose Rinato,

03:07.053 --> 03:10.147
paid her fines,
assumed responsibility for her
granddaughter's compliance.

03:10.223 --> 03:13.249
Well, I guess the rehab
didn't take. We got any
Ieads on our rapist?

03:13.326 --> 03:15.692
I put the witness
with a sketch artist.
She should be done soon.

03:15.762 --> 03:19.391
I'II make sure Fin
shows it to the victim.
If we're Iucky, she knows him.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.864
I want an update from Warner.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.869
And a New Jersey
search warrant
for the rest of the body.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.264
Detective Fin Tutuola.
I'm here to
take your statement.

03:32.812 --> 03:33.972
You?

03:34.047 --> 03:37.778
Hospital has extras.
We had to keep your clothes
as evidence.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.478
What kind of a name is Fin?
It's mine.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.888
Remember anything
about your rape?

03:44.724 --> 03:45.782
No.

03:46.459 --> 03:50.225
What time did you
get to the party?
Around 11:00.

03:50.296 --> 03:53.060
Go alone?
Guy I know told me about it.

03:53.132 --> 03:55.532
We were supposed to hook up,
but he never showed.

03:55.602 --> 03:58.366
What's his name?
It's not important.

03:59.272 --> 04:02.605
He your dealer? Hey, we know
you Iike the needle.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.940
We found it in your blood,
so don't even waste a Iie
on me.

04:07.113 --> 04:10.173
Anybody bother you?
Pay too much
unwanted attention?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.239
(EXHALES)

04:12.352 --> 04:13.944
I didn't notice.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.745
Who'd you score from?

04:17.690 --> 04:18.884
I knew it.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.917
You ever think the guy
might have slipped something
in on you on purpose?

04:23.830 --> 04:27.732
A guy at the party
offered a sample.
Said he Iived there.

04:28.368 --> 04:31.701
Okay. Let's go check on him,
see what he has to say.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.600
Lose something?

04:39.178 --> 04:41.840
My purse.
Yeah. I got that.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.916
Do you always carry
a human finger around
in your bag?

04:50.623 --> 04:55.253
I found it on the street
Iast night. I put it in
a baggie for safekeeping.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.099
It's official.
The finger's dead.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.292
For how Iong?

05:03.369 --> 05:08.500
The mid-PIP has
partial epidermis and some
mummified tissue intact.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.839
Without the rest of the body
and the temperature conditions
of its Iocation,

05:11.911 --> 05:14.471
I'd have to guess, say,
10 to 12 years.

05:14.547 --> 05:17.914
There may not be a body
if the victim says that she
found that on the street.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.045
No, she didn't.
There's no dirt
or signs of scavengers.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.522
It didn't come from a
medical school or Iab because
there's no formalin present.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.321
And the base of the finger
shows it was ripped
from the hand.

05:28.394 --> 05:30.760
Then the body was stashed
somewhere that was protected.

05:30.830 --> 05:34.391
Yes, and you need to find it
so I can tell you
how the baby died.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.367
How young a child
are we Iooking for?

05:36.436 --> 05:41.066
Caucasian between the ages
of 20 months and a Iittle
over two years.

05:46.312 --> 05:51.045
You have access
to the common Iiving areas
and CIaire's room only.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.880
You've been
through this before.

05:52.952 --> 05:56.479
My granddaughter's having
a rough time trying to
reconnect with her mother.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.183
Was CIaire visiting her
recently?

05:58.257 --> 06:01.886
Over the weekend.
It didn't go well.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.930
Is that why
she's using again?
Probably.

06:04.997 --> 06:08.160
Whenever she
visits her mother,
there's usually a fight.

06:08.234 --> 06:12.432
Why don't they get along?
Grace thinks
CIaire is just willful.

06:12.505 --> 06:15.065
If she really
wanted to quit drugs,
she would.

06:15.141 --> 06:17.803
Where does Grace Iive?
AIphabet City.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.703
How bad is it?

06:20.780 --> 06:23.578
What did CIaire do?
She was raped.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.491
I'm going out,
so this'II have to be quick.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.727
Did your daughter stay here
in the Iast couple of days?

06:37.797 --> 06:42.427
That was the plan,
but we got into it, so she
decided to go elsewhere.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.800
What'd you fight about?
Drugs.

06:47.039 --> 06:51.976
Her complete Iack of control,
the company she keeps,
same old, same old.

06:52.779 --> 06:57.546
What'd she do this time?
Your daughter
was recently raped.

07:00.453 --> 07:03.684
Well, if CIaire was high,
then it's her own fault.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.621
She was asking for it.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.786
No one asks to be raped.

07:08.861 --> 07:11.421
So if my cub
didn't do anything,
why are you here?

07:11.497 --> 07:14.796
We've discovered
a child's decomposing finger
in her purse.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.828
Any ideas where she got it?

07:19.005 --> 07:20.302
A finger?

07:22.375 --> 07:25.401
Did you ask CIaire?
She says she found it.

07:25.478 --> 07:30.177
(SCOFFS) Strange as it seems,
she probably did,
knowing the company she keeps.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.979
Is your daughter in the habit
of carrying around
human body parts?

07:33.052 --> 07:34.178
Who can know with CIaire?

07:34.253 --> 07:36.744
She's had so many problems
for so Iong,
it's hard to tell.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.018
She's been in and out
of trouble,

07:39.091 --> 07:41.889
she spent a year in juvenile,
she's tried every drug
they make.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.055
I'm not surprised by anything
she does anymore.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.493
FIN: Mr. Harding.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.125
Here's the hump
that threw the party.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.830
Is he the guy
that slipped you the sample?
No.

07:51.904 --> 07:55.135
You the detective that called?
Yeah.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.438
What's going on?
Looking for a rapist.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.444
I already told the cops
I didn't do it.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.448
And when I catch the bastard
that did, what do you think
he's gonna tell me?

08:03.516 --> 08:06.451
What's up, fellows?
OFFICER: Captain told us
to swing this by.

08:11.424 --> 08:12.823
Come here.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.395
You recognize him?
That's the guy with the tar.

08:18.464 --> 08:20.898
Yeah. I saw him.
What's his name?

08:20.967 --> 08:22.730
I don't know,
but he came with a waitress.

08:22.802 --> 08:26.465
Name's Bella,
she works at the diner
a couple blocks away.

08:29.041 --> 08:32.067
I need to ask about
a friend of yours, Bella.

08:33.546 --> 08:37.448
You went to a party
Iast night, is that right?
What's his name?

08:38.083 --> 08:40.279
He couldn't have
done anything.
He was with me.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.253
He Ieave your side
for more than 10 minutes?

08:42.321 --> 08:45.222
Yeah. We weren't
attached at the hip,
and it was a party.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.952
He Ieave with you?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.325
He said he had to
meet a client.

08:49.395 --> 08:52.694
A woman was raped
at that party, and I
need to know his name.

08:56.068 --> 09:00.402
Arthur Felton. He's a
car broker. At Ieast
that's what he told me.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.906
He comes in here,
flirts with me. I thought
he was a nice guy.

09:06.712 --> 09:07.838
(CAR HORN HONKING)

09:15.388 --> 09:18.118
Sweet ride.
(CHUCKLES) You Fin?

09:18.190 --> 09:20.317
Artie Felton.
Knew you'd Iike her.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.487
Hey, Iet's take her
for a spin.
Tell me what you think.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.155
Detective Odafin Tutuola.
What the hell's going on?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.823
You have the right
to remain silent.

09:26.899 --> 09:30.596
Anything you say can and will
be used against you
in a court of Iaw.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.763
Felton processed?

09:32.838 --> 09:35.136
On his way to the Tombs,
and his blood's at the Iab.

09:35.207 --> 09:37.004
Good job.
I wish they were
all that easy.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.407
The Iineup must
have been solid.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.707
Well, the witness
did everything
but wrap him in a bow.

09:40.780 --> 09:45.479
Sorry to blow your high,
but the DNA on the finger
came back a match.

09:46.719 --> 09:50.086
To who?
Our rape victim,
CIaire Rinato.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.523
I thought you caught
the guy who raped me.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.688
We did.

09:58.798 --> 10:02.427
We want to talk to you
about the finger
you've been carrying.

10:02.501 --> 10:05.470
I've already
explained that to Fin.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.797
You got any kids?
I wouldn't bring
a child into this world.

10:09.875 --> 10:13.743
So you've never been pregnant?
How is that
any of your business?

10:13.813 --> 10:16.043
We ran a DNA test on the bone.

10:16.482 --> 10:19.110
It belongs to your
blood relative. Who?

10:22.254 --> 10:24.188
CIaire, she and I
can be very patient.

10:24.256 --> 10:28.124
You think you can Iast all day
with that knot churning
in your stomach?

10:33.866 --> 10:37.802
Her name's Lisa.
She was my sister.

10:41.107 --> 10:44.941
What happened to her?
I was 13 when she was born.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.842
I took care of her.

10:48.781 --> 10:52.376
I got her
ready in the morning,
dropped her at the sitter,

10:52.451 --> 10:54.715
went to school, picked her up.

10:55.187 --> 10:59.624
I fed her, gave her a bath,
did my homework,

11:00.760 --> 11:06.255
sang songs to her,
taught her not to cry,
to never, ever cry.

11:07.299 --> 11:10.268
And if she did?
My mother would hit her.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.668
Crying drives her crazy.

11:14.807 --> 11:16.741
How did your sister die?

11:20.212 --> 11:22.305
I had to stay after school.

11:23.816 --> 11:27.411
I called the sitter, asked her
if she could keep Lisa
till I could pick her up,

11:27.486 --> 11:29.147
but she was busy.

11:29.221 --> 11:31.712
So what happened
when you got home?

11:33.025 --> 11:35.289
She was dead when I got there.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.022
She probably cried for me
and Grace just snapped.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.695
What did your mother tell you?
That it was an accident.

11:46.305 --> 11:50.765
Lisa fell and hit her head.
I knew she was Iying.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.847
CIaire, where's the body?

12:03.389 --> 12:07.416
Grace stuck her in
an old trunk and put it
in the bedroom closet.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.432
Why are you bothering me
at work? You could've
made an appointment.

12:17.503 --> 12:20.666
God, how am I gonna
explain this to my supervisor?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.264
Tell him the truth.
Which is?

12:22.341 --> 12:24.707
We're investigating
a homicide.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.108
Did something happen
to CIaire?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.645
No. Your daughter's
at our precinct.

12:27.713 --> 12:32.207
Did you have a child in 1986?
Why are you asking?

12:33.319 --> 12:37.915
CIaire said that she had
a baby sister whose body
is stuffed in your closet.

12:39.258 --> 12:42.159
And you believe that?
Why shouldn't we?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.430
Because it's ridiculous.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.195
Did you have another baby
after CIaire was born?

12:51.704 --> 12:54.138
I've only had two children,
Detective.

12:54.206 --> 12:58.267
One, a son who died
a Iong time ago,

12:58.344 --> 13:01.438
and two, CIaire,
who's slowly killing herself.

13:03.215 --> 13:07.151
Why would your daughter
Iie to us?
To get back at me.

13:07.219 --> 13:10.416
Well, we certainly don't
mean to make the situation
between you two any worse,

13:10.489 --> 13:12.957
but we have to check
these things out.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.890
I guess.
We could always
search your home.

13:14.960 --> 13:19.021
That would satisfy us
and CIaire. Maybe even
get her to face her problems.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.023
I'm sorry, but I can't
allow you to invade my privacy

13:22.101 --> 13:25.161
just because my daughter
told you a fairy tale.

13:25.871 --> 13:29.637
Even if it might convince
your troubled daughter
to get some help?

13:29.708 --> 13:32.040
If you had Iived
with CIaire's problems
as Iong as I have,

13:32.111 --> 13:34.477
you would know
when to throw in the towel.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.640
I need to get back to work.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.287
We done here?
You got someplace to go?

13:42.354 --> 13:43.685
I'm tired.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.451
Well, we got some cots
back at the station.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.617
No, thanks.
I'd Iike to go home.

13:47.693 --> 13:51.094
Well, we need you to hang
around the city for another
day while we sort things out.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.564
Fine. I'II be
at the Lydia Hotel in midtown.
You can find me there.

13:54.633 --> 13:58.000
That's a junkie whore hotel.
They charge by the hour.

13:58.070 --> 13:59.970
You're just Iooking to score.

14:00.940 --> 14:04.876
I need to nod, or are you
offering to cop for me?

14:09.048 --> 14:13.610
You don't scare me.
Not sporting
that retro ponytail.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.521
You Iook Iike a pimp.

14:22.461 --> 14:26.090
AII you need
is a feathered hat
and a crushed-velvet suit.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.463
(SNIFFLING)

14:34.940 --> 14:37.909
Stop it.
Just waiting on you
to turn it off.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.070
You're hurting, so Iash out.

14:40.946 --> 14:43.676
Say when, I'II try
to get you some help.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.513
Next you're gonna tell me
you understand my pain.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.645
No, not me. I didn't see
my sister stuffed into a box

14:49.722 --> 14:52.589
and stored in the closet
Iike an old pair of shoes.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.059
So you could cut me
some slack here.

14:57.129 --> 15:00.792
Maybe can the Iecture
and Ieave me alone.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.836
You Iike what you've become?
You Iike being a junkie,
CIaire?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.030
Yeah.

15:07.139 --> 15:11.906
Why no needle marks
for anybody to see? You stick
the needle between your toes.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.272
Let go.

15:15.614 --> 15:18.981
Why hide it
if you're so proud of it,
if you Iike it so damn much?

15:19.051 --> 15:22.282
It's the only time
I feel good about myself,
okay?

15:27.359 --> 15:29.657
I can't see her face anymore,

15:30.930 --> 15:32.761
except when I'm high.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.071
How'd you make out
with CIaire?
Who knows?

15:40.139 --> 15:42.039
She's got more demons
than most.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.734
No wonder,
with a mother Iike that.

15:43.809 --> 15:44.867
FIN: You Iean on her?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.641
We asked nicely
to sweep and search,
Grace still refused.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.673
But we've got an RMP close by
just in case she decides to do
a Iittle spring cleaning.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.378
That doesn't mean anything.

15:54.453 --> 15:58.048
Fin, I gotta tell you,
your attitude baffles me.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.114
You either believe
CIaire's story or you don't.

16:00.192 --> 16:04.219
Living with an addict's
a special kind of hell,
Ioving one's even worse.

16:04.296 --> 16:08.130
I Iearned a Iong time ago
not to believe
most of the things they say.

16:09.001 --> 16:12.698
Grace Rinato has agreed
to Iet the police
search her house.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.798
She say when?

16:14.873 --> 16:17.671
Tomorrow afternoon
when she gets home from work.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.371
So go sit on her
in case she dumps it.

16:24.216 --> 16:27.982
What is she waiting for?
Dead of night.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.715
That smells good.
It is good. You want some?

16:34.793 --> 16:37.261
I can't. Coffee runs
right through me.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.162
FIN: (ON RADIO)
We're wasting our time,
The ho's probably asleep,

16:41.367 --> 16:43.835
Well, I hope not
since I don't want to be
sitting here all night.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.166
That's easy to do
in a nice warm car.

16:46.238 --> 16:50.038
In another 10 minutes,
you're gonna have to
park your ass out here.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.403
Okay. It's a go.
She's on the move.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.503
FIN: She's on the street,

17:22.574 --> 17:27.136
As soon as she drops it, check
the bag. You give us the all
clear, we'II pick her up.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.374
She chucked it.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.260
Take her.
I'II call the morgue, get CSU.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.532
Grace Rinato,
you're under arrest
for the murder of Lisa Rinato.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.165
Hey, I didn't kill anybody.
You have the right
to remain silent.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.903
Anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of Iaw.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.376
You don't understand.
I had to get rid of it.

18:00.446 --> 18:01.777
I couldn't Iet anything else
happen to CIaire.

18:01.847 --> 18:03.075
You have the right
to an attorney.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.013
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.745
PIease don't do this,
or my daughter'II go to jail.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.980
It was an accident.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.989
CIaire killed her baby sister
14 years ago.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.452
You almost done
with the bones?

18:17.529 --> 18:20.054
We're just degreasing
the Iast batch
with soapy water.

18:20.132 --> 18:23.295
Wasn't a Iot of tissue Ieft,
so it didn't take Iong.

18:23.368 --> 18:28.396
Dr. Phillip Devere,
he's our consulting
forensic anthropologist.

18:28.474 --> 18:32.774
Fin. Thought you only used
facial recreations
to ID a body.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.871
Well, there are no photos
of the victim, and you need
visuals for trial.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.214
And it'II help connect
the jury with the Iittle girl.
I'II show you.

18:41.553 --> 18:46.957
Now, it used to take a few
days working with modeling
clay to sculpt a face.

18:47.025 --> 18:50.859
But now, with this
new computer software,
it just takes a few hours.

18:50.929 --> 18:55.229
AII right now,
I'm guessing at the eye color
and the flesh tone,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.495
but at Ieast most of
her hair was still intact.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.037
Am I too early
for cause of death?

19:00.105 --> 19:03.632
For a written report, yes.
For my findings, no.

19:03.709 --> 19:09.477
AII right, now, she has
a compound fracture of the
Ieft scapula. It's shattered.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.210
WARNER: Pay close attention
to the fracture pattern
of the ribs.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.412
Most are cracked
and broken, perimortem.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.717
The trauma is ventral
to dorsal,

19:17.789 --> 19:20.121
in other words,
the blows Ianded
front to back.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.682
Which means
she was kicked to death.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.854
More Iike she was
Iying on her back
when the attack started

19:24.930 --> 19:27.797
and turned defensively
on her right side.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.494
This kind of damage,
she was stomped.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.967
Can I smoke?
Maybe Iater.

19:38.043 --> 19:41.706
I don't have any cigarettes.
I don't have my purse.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.375
You said that CIaire
killed Lisa accidentally.
What happened?

19:45.450 --> 19:49.045
CIaire had only been Iiving
with me for a couple months
when I got pregnant again.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.486
So where's the baby's father?

19:50.556 --> 19:53.684
We were a family for a while
until CIaire ran him off.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.592
She was in and out of trouble,
and he couldn't take any more.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.459
He didn't have to
since she wasn't his.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.725
Where's CIaire's father?
Who knows?

20:00.799 --> 20:02.858
Why wasn't Lisa born
in a hospital?

20:02.935 --> 20:05.927
Because I wanted a home birth.
It's more natural.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.666
Everything went fine.
Lisa was a healthy baby girl.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.903
Right up until
you beat her to death.
CIaire did that.

20:11.977 --> 20:17.313
She was always jealous
of Lisa. I doted on my baby
and CIaire hated that.

20:17.382 --> 20:22.115
She used to
fly into these rages.
Jeez, I couldn't control her.

20:23.055 --> 20:27.253
Fights at school, suspensions,
cops always at my door.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.092
That girl was trouble
from the minute she was born.

20:31.163 --> 20:33.495
What happened
the day Lisa died?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.127
I contacted her father.

20:39.204 --> 20:42.469
Thought it would
be good for Lisa
to have a relationship.

20:42.541 --> 20:44.941
God knows,
girls need their dads.

20:45.844 --> 20:48.813
We agreed
to work something out,
and CIaire overheard me,

20:48.880 --> 20:51.348
started asking questions
about her own sperm donor.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.714
AII right.
What did you tell her?

20:55.721 --> 20:57.279
The truth.

20:57.356 --> 21:00.291
That I've been with a Iot
of guys, and I didn't really
know who he was.

21:00.359 --> 21:03.920
I thought she could
handle that.
So how did she react?

21:05.964 --> 21:09.024
She seemed okay,
but the rage came Iater.

21:10.202 --> 21:13.262
Where were you
when CIaire beat your
daughter to death?

21:16.241 --> 21:17.572
Out.
BENSON: Out.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.569
That's funny,
'cause CIaire said that
she was out, too.

21:20.646 --> 21:23.843
Not Iikely, since she was
babysitting Lisa.

21:23.915 --> 21:25.439
STABLER: Out on a date?

21:25.517 --> 21:26.643
(SIGHING)

21:28.153 --> 21:32.920
Okay, so I was in a bar
getting fixed up. Men
considered me very attractive.

21:34.092 --> 21:35.582
They still do.

21:36.328 --> 21:41.425
If you didn't trust CIaire
with Lisa, why would you
Ieave them alone together?

21:41.500 --> 21:45.994
I didn't think she'd kill her.
Look, I'm not proud of myself.

21:47.139 --> 21:50.597
When I got home
my baby was dead,
and CIaire was a wreck.

21:50.676 --> 21:55.010
She said it was an accident.
She was always sorry
after her rages.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.516
She needed help then,
and obviously
she needs it now.

21:59.918 --> 22:05.185
So you stuffed the remains
of your youngest child
in a trunk to protect CIaire?

22:06.558 --> 22:08.753
Why not get her help then,
when you knew she needed it?

22:08.827 --> 22:12.957
I did help her!
Her secret was safe
with me for 14 years.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.692
Is that why you didn't
dump the body before?

22:14.766 --> 22:18.224
Well, I couldn't risk
anyone finding it
and tracing it back to CIaire.

22:18.303 --> 22:22.239
With her juvenile record,
she would've gone
straight to prison.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.507
Look, I'd already
failed her enough.

22:26.812 --> 22:30.009
She's my daughter.
What else could I do?

22:30.082 --> 22:32.380
Well, that's textbook
hump behavior.

22:32.451 --> 22:34.646
Deny everything
and stick it
to the other guy.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.847
I've got enough
to put Grace Rinato
away for murder.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.254
She Iied to the police
and she dumped the remains.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.189
Possession's being
nine-tenths and all.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.989
Something
sticking in your craw?

22:44.963 --> 22:48.922
Both suspects have an agenda.
Neither one of them
is exactly trustworthy.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.231
We should do
a thorough background check
and find out who's Iying.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.602
Well, Iet's just check
into Grace's statement,

22:54.673 --> 22:57.608
Iook into CIaire's records
from her school,
juvenile facility.

22:57.676 --> 23:01.407
We'II pull up the old 61s,
see if she's as much trouble
as her mother claims.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.845
Well, it's up to you, AIex.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.441
Do you want to vacate the
charges against Grace while we
try to nail her to the wall?

23:06.518 --> 23:10.682
Not a chance. I've got enough
to go to trial.
Anything else is just gravy.

23:15.127 --> 23:19.120
"Docket number 624353,
People v, Grace Rinato,

23:19.197 --> 23:23.031
"Two counts of Murder
in the Second Degree, Intent
and Depraved Indifference.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.591
"One count
Hindering Prosecution.

23:24.669 --> 23:26.637
"One count Tampering
with Physical Evidence"'

23:26.705 --> 23:29.936
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.135
Remand, Your Honor.
That's ridiculous.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.077
My client has permanent
residence. She's gainfully
employed by the state.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.239
She's not going anywhere.

23:36.314 --> 23:37.941
CABOT: The defendant
committed murder.

23:38.016 --> 23:41.076
She willfully and maliciously
beat a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to death

23:41.153 --> 23:45.522
and then callously dumped
the remains in a bedroom
closet to avoid justice.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.024
Do you propose
to try your case right here,
Miss Cabot?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.721
No. I'm merely using rhetoric
to make my point.

23:50.796 --> 23:53.856
One of your
more endearing qualities.
Approach.

23:59.304 --> 24:01.499
There seems to be
some error here.

24:01.573 --> 24:04.371
There is only one defendant.
There should be two.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.501
I don't understand.

24:05.577 --> 24:08.876
Your entire case rests upon
the word of the victim's
drug-addicted sister,

24:08.947 --> 24:10.972
who I don't see
on my docket. Why is that?

24:11.049 --> 24:13.279
The People aren't charging her
with Lisa Rinato's death.

24:13.351 --> 24:15.683
Is there any corroboration?
No.

24:16.254 --> 24:18.051
My client acted
to prevent her daughter,
CIaire,

24:18.123 --> 24:19.283
from being charged
with murder.

24:19.357 --> 24:21.689
The defendant
had possession of the body.

24:21.760 --> 24:25.423
If that's your only argument,
CIaire Rinato was also
in possession of body parts.

24:25.497 --> 24:27.522
Well, if that's true,
then it stands to reason

24:27.599 --> 24:30.591
that you would
charge CIaire Rinato
as a co-conspirator.

24:30.669 --> 24:34.469
So I expect you to
bring charges before
the close of business today.

24:34.539 --> 24:37.508
With all due respect,
Your Honor, you don't have
the right or the authority

24:37.576 --> 24:41.910
to tell the District
Attorney's Office who or when
to Ievel charges against.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.311
Step back.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.284
The People
have requested remand.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.587
Well, you're not gonna get it.
$300,000.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.593
CABOT: Objection.
Overruled.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.391
Your Honor, I must object.
Since you've rebuked me
for manipulating

24:59.464 --> 25:02.433
the Iaw to my own advantage,
your ruling seems
hypocritical.

25:02.501 --> 25:03.525
That's enough.

25:03.602 --> 25:06.628
One more word out of you
and you will be enjoying
my hospitality.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.674
Ma'am, I urge you
to reconsider or you will
force me to file a grievance.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.902
You're in contempt. Bailiff.

25:17.115 --> 25:18.582
(DOOR BUZZING)

25:18.717 --> 25:21.117
Lewin is making nice
with the judge
to get you out of here,

25:21.186 --> 25:24.553
so be prepared
for that ass-chewing
phone call.

25:24.623 --> 25:27.183
I'm not going anywhere.
Petrovsky crossed a Iine.

25:27.259 --> 25:30.558
I want to get her censured
or thrown off the bench.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.893
At Ieast you're not dull,
I'II say that for you.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.331
Forget her, AIex.
She'II bury you.

25:36.401 --> 25:39.996
I need your support, Liz.
For what?
So you can start a war?

25:40.071 --> 25:42.266
You file a judiciary
grievance against her,

25:42.340 --> 25:44.171
and every judge we face
will take it personally.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.142
So what, she gets
to push us around?

25:46.211 --> 25:48.771
She's not pushing us around,
she's pushing you.

25:48.847 --> 25:52.146
AII the more reason
not to bait her.
How am I baiting her?

25:52.217 --> 25:55.050
By refusing
to prosecute someone
I don't think is guilty?

25:55.120 --> 25:58.385
I won't do it,
and she can't force me to.
But I can.

25:58.456 --> 25:59.980
And I wouldn't be so quick
to pronounce

26:00.058 --> 26:02.891
CIaire Rinato innocent
without all the facts.

26:02.961 --> 26:06.260
SVU detectives found
that CIaire was prone
to uncontrollable rages.

26:06.331 --> 26:09.994
It's all well-documented
by the school
and juvenile detention.

26:10.068 --> 26:14.732
She attacked kids and had a
nasty habit of kicking them
while they were down.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.407
Are you ordering me
to file charges?
No. I already did it for you.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.124
Thirty-four hours,
22 minutes and still clean.

26:35.193 --> 26:39.493
I'm dying,
just Iike my plants.
Gotta Iock you up, CIaire.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.191
Why?
You Iied.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.290
About what?

26:42.367 --> 26:45.063
About flying into rages
and attacking people.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.001
You there when
your sister was killed?

26:47.072 --> 26:49.973
I couldn't stop it.
It was already too Iate.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.771
I gotta take you in, CIaire.

26:52.844 --> 26:56.143
What's happening?
Stay out of it, Nana.
Let him do his job.

26:56.214 --> 26:57.943
She's gonna be booked
and sent to the Tombs.

26:58.016 --> 27:01.110
Arraignment'II be
day after tomorrow. Bail
will be set around $300,000.

27:01.186 --> 27:03.916
You'II need 10%.
Can you get that?

27:10.862 --> 27:14.298
Miss Cabot.
My granddaughter
did not kill her sister.

27:15.133 --> 27:18.330
With all due respect,
Mrs. Rinato, you didn't
even know she had one.

27:18.403 --> 27:23.431
I was ill. It took me a Iong
time to recover. But I
raised CIaire. I know her.

27:23.508 --> 27:27.501
You raised Grace as well.
Are you saying
she's capable of murder?

27:28.980 --> 27:33.815
Mrs. Rinato, you need to see
the clerk just down the hall
to post CIaire's bail.

27:37.889 --> 27:41.381
What's really going on here is
a young woman is paying
for your inability

27:41.459 --> 27:42.858
to play well with others.

27:42.927 --> 27:45.987
If nothing else,
you should recuse yourself.
Not gonna happen.

27:46.064 --> 27:47.429
Your client was present
during the crime,

27:47.499 --> 27:49.433
and she does have a history
of violent behavior.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.163
Then charge her as a minor.
She was only 15 at the time.

27:52.237 --> 27:54.467
I'm sorry,
but my hands are tied.

27:54.539 --> 27:57.633
Maybe a different judge
can untie them for you.

28:04.883 --> 28:08.114
You've got five minutes.
I'm all ears.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.888
My client is running Iate,
Your Honor.

28:10.955 --> 28:13.321
My docket is full.
Define "Iate"'

28:14.693 --> 28:15.682
I can't.

28:15.760 --> 28:19.662
Was the defendant made aware
that the motion hearing
was scheduled for today?

28:19.731 --> 28:22.598
A motion that you filed
on her behalf
to try her as a minor.

28:22.667 --> 28:23.793
Yes, sir.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.428
Did the People send notice?
We did.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.832
Then where is she?
I don't know.

28:30.909 --> 28:34.242
When was the Iast time
you actually spoke
with your client?

28:34.312 --> 28:37.281
Your Honor, if there are
no objections, I would
be willing to reschedule.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.714
A generous offer, Miss Cabot,
but totally unnecessary

28:39.784 --> 28:44.016
since I'm issuing
a bench warrant for the
defendant's arrest right now.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.924
You wanna tell me why
a bench warrant goes
city-wide for CIaire Rinato,

28:51.996 --> 28:55.454
and you couldn't
pick up the phone?
There wasn't enough time.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.831
The judge issued the warrant
when she didn't
show up for court.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.530
If you hadn't charged her
in the first place,
she wouldn't be in this mess.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.402
That wasn't my call.

29:02.474 --> 29:06.604
CIaire Iied to us. I can't
ignore that. I don't think
you should, either.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.671
Can you buy me some time?
Why, do you know where she is?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.684
I'm guessing this skank hotel
in midtown she Iikes.

29:18.790 --> 29:22.487
She came in a while ago
and hasn't Ieft
since I've been on.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.053
(MUSIC PLAYING)

29:25.597 --> 29:26.859
Damn it!

29:31.469 --> 29:35.530
Yeah, this is
Detective Tutuola,
badge number 43198.

29:35.607 --> 29:41.011
I need a bus at the
Lydia Hotel, midtown, Room
419, got a heroin overdose.

29:42.847 --> 29:45.873
Come on. Don't do this.
Come on.

30:00.832 --> 30:02.493
Damn you, CIaire.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.874
Trying to take
the easy way out?

30:15.480 --> 30:16.970
And if I was?

30:20.118 --> 30:23.053
Then it's too bad
I got there in time.

30:26.624 --> 30:31.186
I really didn't mean
to overdo it, really.
That's what all junkies say.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.527
You've done your good deed.
Now you can go.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.066
Maybe you don't get it.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.228
You're in serious trouble.
You don't pay attention,
you're going to prison.

30:39.304 --> 30:40.566
Are you still here?

30:40.638 --> 30:44.005
I really can't believe,
you know, I almost bought it.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.942
How you took care
of your sister and Ioved her.

30:47.011 --> 30:49.411
Damn girl, you're better
than the soaps.

30:49.480 --> 30:54.213
You have no idea what it feels
Iike to have a mother that
doesn't give a damn about you.

30:54.285 --> 30:57.186
Violin's gonna
start any minute.
Screw you.

30:58.957 --> 31:00.686
Lisa was all I had.

31:02.594 --> 31:06.291
Oh, she was actually happy
to see me come
through the door.

31:07.999 --> 31:11.230
Unconditional Iove is a rush.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.734
Give it to me straight.
You kill her?

31:20.778 --> 31:21.836
No.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.877
But I couldn't protect her.

31:28.987 --> 31:30.784
Grace was too strong.

31:34.092 --> 31:36.424
She told me

31:36.494 --> 31:39.986
that if I didn't keep
my mouth shut,

31:40.064 --> 31:41.463
I was next.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.428
You tell anybody?

31:45.536 --> 31:48.835
I called my grandmother
the first time I was alone.

31:50.475 --> 31:54.969
But she was recovering
from another stroke

31:56.881 --> 31:59.349
and I guess
she didn't believe me.

32:00.818 --> 32:04.549
Well, if that's
how it went down,
then it wasn't your fault.

32:10.228 --> 32:13.254
That Iittle girl
trusted me to keep her safe.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.602
How is it not my fault?

32:27.111 --> 32:29.944
CIaire's on her way back to
the Tombs. Is there anything
we can do to help her?

32:30.014 --> 32:31.345
No, she's going to prison.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.385
With her history of violent
rages, the jury's going
to believe that she is guilty.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.977
That's what you're going with?
She did it 'cause
you can sell it?

32:37.055 --> 32:38.317
I'm not railroading her.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.414
You just need a win
to get the boss
out of your ass.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.618
You seem to have done a 180
all of a sudden.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.855
Excuse me?
AIex.

32:44.929 --> 32:48.592
If CIaire killed her sister,
she wouldn't have taken the
finger after all those years.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.724
Well, I might
be able to sell that

32:49.801 --> 32:52.998
if she had turned her mother
in or asked for help
or told someone.

32:53.071 --> 32:56.507
She did tell somebody.
She told Grandma.

32:57.408 --> 33:01.344
Grace had three kids.
Two are dead. Now I don't
Iike those odds, do you?

33:01.412 --> 33:03.812
Maybe it's time to ask Rose
the hard questions.

33:03.881 --> 33:06.111
And dig up the infant's body.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.450
Just so you know, if you're
Iooking for a miracle,
you'd better start praying.

33:17.528 --> 33:21.020
The death certificate says
crib death. I'm just hoping
they missed something.

33:21.099 --> 33:24.591
SIDS-related death
is an exclusionary
pathological finding.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.001
So if a kid croaks
and the ME can't
find another reason,

33:27.071 --> 33:29.505
it's Sudden Infant Death.

33:29.574 --> 33:33.476
We call that idiopathic
when there's no clear
medical explanation.

33:33.544 --> 33:36.206
Everyone experiences
sleep apnea.

33:36.280 --> 33:37.440
You stop breathing
during the night,

33:37.515 --> 33:39.915
but usually the body knows
when to start up again.

33:39.984 --> 33:43.147
SIDS babies don't know
when to breathe,
and we don't know why.

33:43.221 --> 33:46.213
What if our suspect
smothered the kid
with a pillow?

33:46.290 --> 33:50.954
I'd check the eyes,
but at 30 years plus,
I probably can't tell you.

33:51.029 --> 33:54.294
Don't give up yet.
Just giving you the Iong odds.

33:55.566 --> 33:59.935
While I was recuperating,
I didn't speak to CIaire.

34:00.004 --> 34:03.098
She'd upset me
wanting to come
Iive with me again.

34:03.174 --> 34:05.608
And I barely spoke
to her mother.

34:06.177 --> 34:09.806
I could never get
a straight answer.
Straight answer about what?

34:09.880 --> 34:14.818
How CIaire was adjusting
to Iife with her. I'm only
here to vouch for CIaire.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.382
You don't Iike Grace.

34:18.556 --> 34:22.047
She's my daughter,
Detective. I Iove her.

34:22.126 --> 34:24.856
It's not her fault
she's Iike she is.

34:24.929 --> 34:27.920
She's had problems
from the day her father Ieft.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.364
So CIaire didn't fit in
with her Iifestyle.

34:30.435 --> 34:34.235
The situation
required an adjustment
for both of them.

34:35.172 --> 34:38.540
But I was concerned
because Grace isn't patient.

34:39.342 --> 34:44.076
Is that what happened with
the first baby? Was her Iack
of patience the issue?

34:46.016 --> 34:48.542
What are you getting at,
Detective?

34:49.286 --> 34:52.688
What happened
the night he died?
Nothing.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.817
We went to sleep as usual.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.357
I got up
in the middle of the night
to check on Anthony.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.728
The crib was in Grace's room.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.997
When I got there,
he was already blue.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.430
Why did you check on him?

35:11.509 --> 35:14.342
Well,
Grace was a young mother.
She didn't know anything.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.745
Stands to reason
I would help her
with the baby.

35:17.815 --> 35:21.307
Yes, but the baby
was two months old
when it died.

35:21.385 --> 35:22.875
Why didn't she have
a handle on it by then?

35:22.954 --> 35:26.048
He was colicky.
Cried all the time.

35:26.691 --> 35:30.752
Nothing worked.
We spent our nights
walking him.

35:30.828 --> 35:35.288
We were told that your
daughter can't stand crying,
that it makes her crazy.

35:36.834 --> 35:40.429
Excuse me, how is this
going to help CIaire?

35:40.505 --> 35:43.736
Ma'am, no one can help
your granddaughter.
She's going to prison.

35:43.808 --> 35:48.211
Why? She didn't do it.
You have to believe that.

35:48.279 --> 35:52.875
AII a jury has to hear
is that CIaire's violent, and
she's doing 25-to-Iife, easy.

35:56.053 --> 35:57.281
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

36:03.961 --> 36:08.864
Fin just called.
Warner can't find a thing
to support infanticide.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.698
The hyoid wasn't broken?
That'd be too easy.

36:12.770 --> 36:16.831
She probably smothered him
with a blanket.
I'm out of suggestions.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.736
Let Mrs. Rinato
talk to Grace in Rikers.
Why?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.979
We don't have evidence.
We're gonna need a confession.

36:25.049 --> 36:27.950
I think Rose is ready
to fall on her sword.

36:32.256 --> 36:34.622
If the purpose
of this Iittle gathering
is a digging expedition,

36:34.692 --> 36:36.785
we can stop right here.
It's a separate issue.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.625
We are within our rights
to interrogate
a homicide suspect.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.358
You can do that on cross,
Counselor.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.729
I can't cross-examine
your client

36:42.800 --> 36:44.290
for something she hasn't
been charged with yet.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.165
BARBOUR: Excuse me?

36:46.237 --> 36:48.603
Let's talk about
Anthony Rinato.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.507
What about him?
Stop. Who's Anthony?

36:53.578 --> 36:55.341
STABLER: Another dead child.

36:57.248 --> 37:01.014
We exhumed his body, Grace.
You can't do that.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.884
Can they just do that?
Can they just dig up
my son Iike that?

37:06.958 --> 37:10.689
They need a court order
or permission
from a family member.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.055
(DOOR OPENS)

37:18.536 --> 37:19.560
Ma.

37:20.504 --> 37:22.597
I can't Iet you do it, Grace.

37:32.883 --> 37:33.872
(GROANS)

37:35.987 --> 37:40.083
You sold me out, didn't you?
Should've done it Iong ago.

37:40.424 --> 37:44.656
Oh, you promised me, Mama.

37:44.729 --> 37:47.698
You swore when Daddy Ieft
you'd Iook after me.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.097
Since you were the one
that drove him away.

37:50.167 --> 37:54.228
That man was a Iousy husband
and horrible father.

37:54.305 --> 37:57.365
I don't know why he never
kept in touch with you.

37:57.441 --> 38:00.308
Maybe he saw
something ugly in you,

38:00.378 --> 38:03.745
something I couldn't face
until now.

38:03.814 --> 38:07.215
No. That's not true.
He Ioved me!

38:07.985 --> 38:12.081
It was your fault. You
kept him from me. You're just
bitter 'cause he dumped you.

38:12.156 --> 38:15.592
Grace, I'm tired of the guilt.

38:15.660 --> 38:19.994
I'm tired of cleaning up
your mess. I'm tired of you.

38:20.064 --> 38:23.465
You suck the Iife out of
everything you touch,

38:23.534 --> 38:25.263
but you won't get CIaire.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.499
What the hell's
so special about her?

38:31.175 --> 38:33.507
She never killed anyone,
Grace.

38:40.251 --> 38:43.652
She never covered
her son's face
to stop his crying

38:43.721 --> 38:46.952
and watched him
struggle for his Iast breath.

38:47.792 --> 38:49.259
I didn't kill him, you did.

38:49.327 --> 38:54.060
If you had taken him for
just one night, but, no, you
had to teach me a Iesson.

38:54.131 --> 38:57.123
You wanted that baby,
you were damn well
gonna take care of him.

38:57.201 --> 39:01.137
He was your responsibility.
I never wanted him.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.542
Kids are the price you pay
for being with a man who'II
just dump you in the end.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.408
Isn't that what you said
when Daddy Ieft?

39:10.314 --> 39:13.579
Whose idea was it
to put him in that crib
and wait to call the doctor?

39:13.651 --> 39:16.882
Hers. Isn't
my mother brilliant?

39:16.954 --> 39:19.013
I did that to protect you.

39:20.257 --> 39:24.990
I wasn't the best mother.
You needed so much.

39:25.062 --> 39:27.758
I just could never
fill that hole in you.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.630
But you jumped through
hoops for CIaire.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.068
You thought she was
your second chance
to get it right.

39:34.138 --> 39:39.337
Well, she's a junkie, Ma,
so you still screwed up.

39:39.410 --> 39:41.503
It's not me, it's you!

39:44.749 --> 39:47.274
Deep down, I knew
you'd kill again.

39:47.351 --> 39:51.117
The only reason CIaire's alive
is that I took her from you.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.881
Wish I could've
done the same for Lisa.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.427
I never should've
covered for you.

39:58.195 --> 40:00.220
Who are you kidding, Ma?

40:00.297 --> 40:04.097
You covered it up for yourself
so the neighbors
wouldn't gossip.

40:04.168 --> 40:08.332
I know that, Grace.
I Iive with it every day.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.040
Do you have what you need?

40:12.109 --> 40:16.205
I'II drop the charges
against your granddaughter
as soon as we're done here.

40:18.716 --> 40:20.684
BARBOUR: What are you
offering, Counselor?

40:20.751 --> 40:23.515
CABOT: Nothing,
going for the maximum.

40:28.692 --> 40:29.681
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:36.233 --> 40:41.000
You're under arrest
for obstruction of justice in
the murder of Anthony Rinato.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.239
Do we have to use the cuffs?

40:44.308 --> 40:48.836
I'm responsible for the deaths
of two innocent children,
Detective.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.616
I think handcuffs
are appropriate.

40:56.720 --> 40:57.709
(BUZZING)

41:02.259 --> 41:03.749
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

41:12.470 --> 41:14.131
(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

41:20.311 --> 41:22.643
How's my grandmother?
She's holding her own.

41:22.713 --> 41:26.205
You won't be able
to see her till tomorrow.

41:26.283 --> 41:29.775
What's that?
Your Iast excuse
for not going to rehab.

41:40.297 --> 41:41.628
(SOBBING)

41:47.071 --> 41:49.733
No more Iame-ass whining
about how you gotta get high

41:49.807 --> 41:52.605
to remember what your
sister Iooked Iike.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.209
I would hug you,

41:59.850 --> 42:02.819
but I can tell you don't
Iike to be touched.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.748
This is a good place to go
to start getting clean.

42:08.826 --> 42:12.262
A friend of mine runs it,
and I told him to expect you.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.323
Okay.

42:15.766 --> 42:18.735
Don't make me have to
come run your ass down,
CIaire.

42:33.017 --> 42:34.245
Thanks.
