00:02.402 --> 00:04.768
<i>On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air:</i>

00:05.171 --> 00:06.331
It's off to the shelter.

00:06.506 --> 00:10.772
Oh, honey, I think it's wonderful that you're
helping less fortunate on Thanksgiving.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.936
Sylvia, you can tell Mr. Wilmore
that I quit.

00:14.114 --> 00:17.106
Is that what you want me to tell
the news crew when they show up?

00:17.283 --> 00:20.275
- You wouldn't.
- Try me.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.115
- Two...
- Oh, come on, man!

00:23.289 --> 00:27.020
- Aah-aah-aah! Oh!
- Look at this guy. I can't believe this guy.

00:27.193 --> 00:31.630
Mommy,
Daddy's fallen and he can't get up!

00:32.499 --> 00:35.525
One special coming right up.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.666
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

00:42.842 --> 00:44.810
- This ain't no big deal.
- Freeze!

00:47.914 --> 00:50.109
Maybe this is a big deal, Uncle Phil.

02:08.895 --> 02:12.058
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

02:12.232 --> 02:15.201
- It's an honor, Your Honor.
- Ha-ha-ha. That's very amusing, Hendricks.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.667
Why don't you save us all a lot of trouble
and just drop this nonsense?

02:18.838 --> 02:20.305
It's not up to me to drop it...

02:20.473 --> 02:23.567
...only the DA can make that call,
but I thought you'd know that.

02:23.743 --> 02:25.438
Look, the DA is not gonna file on this.

02:25.612 --> 02:28.376
- It's garbage. Nothing happened.
- Ah.

02:30.183 --> 02:32.447
Well, we can't say nothing happened,
Uncle Phil.

02:32.619 --> 02:36.612
You know, there was a couple of butt-naked
honeys scattered around that place.

02:36.789 --> 02:40.748
When the press gets ahold of this, they're
gonna have a field day. Lock them up.

02:43.029 --> 02:47.056
Oh, all right, I guess you just gonna do us
like this, huh, bro? Just like that?

02:47.233 --> 02:49.861
I guess you wasn't
at the Million Man March, huh?

02:50.870 --> 02:53.236
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.704
This cell ain't full yet.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.268
Hold up, hold up.

02:57.443 --> 03:00.241
My back. My back.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.573
All right.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.445
Mm. Mm, mm.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.677
Another year, another hairdo.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.378
Who you trying to catch, Hattie?

03:10.924 --> 03:16.021
I guess you and Will gonna be hitting one
of them all-night Thanksgiving jams, huh?

03:16.196 --> 03:19.996
Oh, girl, that boy couldn't keep up with me
if I gave him a head start.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.133
I've got one more outside. I'll go get it.

03:24.637 --> 03:25.763
He's a hunk.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.931
Yeah. Did you see the way
he was looking at me?

03:29.108 --> 03:32.737
Girl, that man wasn't looking at you,
he was looking at me. Tsk.

03:32.912 --> 03:37.747
Looking at me like it was lunchtime and
my legs was Colonel Sanders' extra crispy.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.750
Wasn't he, Geoffrey?

03:40.920 --> 03:44.686
If you mean something fast and cheap,
yes.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.985
I'm Skippy.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.964
Skippy. What's up?

03:57.537 --> 04:02.133
Uncle Phil, they cannot make these charges
stick, man. You said that yourself.

04:02.308 --> 04:04.640
Will you be my friend?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.603
Um...

04:07.780 --> 04:09.407
No.

04:12.452 --> 04:15.387
- Wait, Uncle Phil, where you going?
- I'm gonna call my lawyer.

04:15.555 --> 04:16.613
Wait, wait, wait.

04:16.789 --> 04:21.249
Uncle Phil, you might know your way
around the mean streets of Bel-Air...

04:21.427 --> 04:26.023
...but I think you better let me handle
this brother on the phone, all right? Hold up.

04:29.402 --> 04:31.666
Yo, bro, phone check.

04:33.873 --> 04:36.239
Hey, look,
we got an important call to make.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.876
What's the big deal anyway?

04:38.044 --> 04:41.138
It wouldn't be the first time
you broke somebody's legs.

04:41.347 --> 04:43.212
All right.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.950
I love you too, Mama.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.121
You want the phone?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.656
Uh... Y-yes, please.

04:55.228 --> 04:57.321
It's yours.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.664
It's for you.

05:09.375 --> 05:11.002
Those don't go there.

05:11.177 --> 05:14.943
- Yes, they do. You said before...
- No, I told you those go in the back.

05:15.114 --> 05:19.050
I should expect that from someone who's
probably never cleaned a dish in their life.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.917
What's your problem?

05:23.089 --> 05:26.957
From the first second I got here, you've
been on me like I've done something wrong.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.429
Maybe I don't come to places like this and
do this kind of work as often as I could.

05:31.597 --> 05:35.089
And maybe sometimes I say things
that sound insensitive and self-centered...

05:35.268 --> 05:37.259
...but that's who I am, damn it.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.605
It doesn't make me a bad person.

05:40.773 --> 05:43.333
Just because you volunteer
more days a year than I do...

05:43.509 --> 05:45.409
...doesn't mean you're better than me.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.205
I didn't volunteer at all.

05:47.580 --> 05:50.071
Oh, so you're paid to be here.

05:50.249 --> 05:53.116
Honey, I live here.

05:55.254 --> 05:56.881
So the plates go in the back?

06:01.394 --> 06:04.056
That's it. There's nothing left.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.492
What do you mean?

06:05.665 --> 06:08.133
- I'm sorry, folks. We're out.
Aww.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.034
This is terrible.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.570
How did this happen?

06:13.740 --> 06:16.937
There's just so many more mouths
than there is money to feed them.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.135
You had some letter
you wanted me to sign.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.644
Oh, yeah.

06:23.583 --> 06:27.246
I wanna thank you both very much
for your time and your help.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.980
Happy Thanksgiving.

06:43.469 --> 06:49.772
I'm thinking that in a week when we
look back on this, we are just gonna laugh.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.270
Maybe two weeks.

06:56.949 --> 07:02.319
- I got it. Edison Field, fall of 1967.
- That was the Dartmouth game.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.751
Tiny Williams. Oh.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.827
And you're Big Phil Banks.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.725
How you doing?

07:11.898 --> 07:14.458
Wait a minute,
so you guys are old college buddies.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.033
Hey, it's a good thing, man...

07:16.202 --> 07:18.898
...I thought we was gonna have
to Bruce Lee you up in here, you know?

07:20.973 --> 07:22.907
Skippy?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.671
Oh.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.904
I haven't seen you since you had
your accident in the big game.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.378
That was no accident at all.
That was clipping.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.177
That's not what the referee said.

07:32.351 --> 07:35.650
What about that shot to the helmet
during the last play? What was that?

07:36.322 --> 07:37.789
A shot to the helmet?

07:38.224 --> 07:39.248
Oh...

07:42.995 --> 07:45.896
So how you been?

07:46.065 --> 07:49.262
Man, my knee was never the same
after that game.

07:49.435 --> 07:53.769
Lost my scholarship, had to leave school,
and then I got drafted.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.703
Ended up with a head full of shrapnel.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.739
Couldn't hold a job once I got back.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.109
So to make a few bucks, I drove
a friend's car a cross-country for him.

08:03.282 --> 08:06.843
What he didn't tell me was
there was 40 pounds of pot in the trunk.

08:07.019 --> 08:11.353
I did 10 hard years, and finally got out.

08:11.524 --> 08:15.358
But after that, my life started to go bad.

08:18.297 --> 08:19.355
How about you, Banks?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.858
About the same.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.202
Why aren't you talking?

08:30.376 --> 08:35.075
I'm not, not talking. I'm just not talking.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.682
- Why aren't you talking?
- I am talking.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.048
I'm the one who just asked a question.
You're the one not talking.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.815
Having to participate
in this inane conversation...

08:44.991 --> 08:47.653
...would keep anyone from talking.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.825
Well, I think you're feeling guilty
and that's why you're not talking.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.928
What in the world would I have
to feel guilty about?

08:55.101 --> 08:57.092
You profited from another's misfortune.

08:57.603 --> 09:00.595
You're the one who went to the shelter
to get the free publicity.

09:00.773 --> 09:03.571
You're the one with
a letter of recommendation in his pocket.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.438
Face it, you're a taker.

09:05.611 --> 09:10.742
I'm a taker?
Miss "Daddy, can I have $300?"

09:11.484 --> 09:12.951
Right, Mr. "Hey, Big Guy...

09:13.119 --> 09:16.247
...can I have a copy of your will
in case something happens to you?"

09:17.156 --> 09:19.181
That's called prudent planning.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.225
Yeah, if your last name's Menendez.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.462
- You're doing it again.
- What?

09:30.636 --> 09:33.764
Not talking. Your guilt will consume you.

09:33.940 --> 09:38.502
See, you're a nag. That's exactly why
you don't have a boyfriend.

09:38.678 --> 09:39.838
And you're a taker.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.404
- Nag.
- Taker.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.605
- Nag.
- Taker.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.806
- Nag.
- Taker.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.110
- Nag.
- Watch the road!

09:53.359 --> 09:55.691
I wonder why Philip and Will are so late.

09:55.861 --> 10:00.355
Well, maybe they pulled in, smelled
your stuffing and turned back around.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.001
Ha-ha-ha. Now, that's a good one.
Ha-ha-ha.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.137
Of course, yours ain't no better.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.440
It's just like men.
They're probably at some sports bar...

10:09.609 --> 10:12.134
...puffing cigars,
watching football on a big screen...

10:12.311 --> 10:15.212
...completely disregarding
the years of suffering that women...

10:15.381 --> 10:17.576
Shut up, Ashley.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.553
I really am worried about Philip and Will.

10:22.722 --> 10:26.556
Trust me, my son would never miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.195
It's the holiday. Settle in, boys.
Nobody's going anywhere tonight.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.773
There's a bug on mine.

10:53.452 --> 10:58.515
You know, a few hours ago, my biggest
problem was judging a stuffing contest.

10:59.058 --> 11:00.457
Now look at me.

11:00.626 --> 11:06.223
Stuck in a jail cell with some angry
400-pound man whose life you wrecked.

11:08.534 --> 11:09.831
You clipped him, didn't you?

11:11.904 --> 11:14.566
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.

11:15.941 --> 11:18.205
- It's the worst Thanksgiving I ever had.
- Heh.

11:18.377 --> 11:21.107
And thank you so much
for sharing it with me.

11:22.048 --> 11:25.176
Look at us. All hungry.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.479
I'm about to dig in
to this cream-of-bug sandwich.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.517
And our family...

11:32.692 --> 11:35.684
...sitting around the dining-room table...

11:36.128 --> 11:39.063
...big gorgeous roasted turkey...

11:39.231 --> 11:42.166
...four different kinds of stuffing.

11:42.635 --> 11:49.040
Candied yams, and macaroni and cheese,
mashed potatoes.

11:50.843 --> 11:57.146
And little tiny onions
swimming in a sea of cream sauce.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.445
Hendricks!

12:03.255 --> 12:06.782
Listen, Banks, if it's a sandwich
you're after, they're all gone.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.556
In the first place, it's not "Banks"...

12:11.731 --> 12:13.528
...it's "Your Honor."

12:14.433 --> 12:16.697
Now you get your butt
over to that telephone...

12:16.869 --> 12:20.361
...and you pull the district attorney
from whatever meal he may be eating...

12:20.539 --> 12:24.976
...and you tell him that you have Judge
Philip Banks in jail under a bogus charge.

12:25.144 --> 12:28.580
And you might wanna mention the fact
that we have been denied due process.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.546
A phone call,
access to legal representation...

12:31.717 --> 12:35.813
...and every other conceivable right
guaranteed to us by the constitution.

12:37.056 --> 12:39.854
Don't forget to mention
that no statements have been taken...

12:40.025 --> 12:43.552
...no witnesses interviewed, and none
of the most fundamental procedures...

12:43.729 --> 12:46.789
...that the newest rookie on a beat
would know, have been followed.

12:46.966 --> 12:50.561
My nephew and I are completely innocent,
and if you don't take care of this...

12:50.736 --> 12:54.570
...it will be you having your picture taken
with numbers across your chest.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.977
And we want $10,000
in unmarked bills...

13:00.146 --> 13:05.049
...and a helicopter on the roof
gassed up and ready to take us to Tijuana.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.145
Oh, sorry.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.156
I just kind of got caught up
in the moment.

13:15.561 --> 13:18.792
Okay, get your peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.

13:22.401 --> 13:23.732
Grape jelly?

13:23.903 --> 13:26.804
You can't make these
with no damn grape jelly.

13:30.843 --> 13:34.574
- Hi, everybody. We're back.
Aww...

13:34.747 --> 13:36.510
Surprise!

13:43.856 --> 13:46.552
Hey, hey, hey.

13:57.736 --> 14:01.331
- So, what do you think?
- A caterer for Thanksgiving dinner.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.203
I think it's just as snooty
and stuck-up as you can get.

14:06.779 --> 14:08.246
But I think it's great.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.746
- Everybody's having a good time.
- Oh! Yeah.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.180
That is,
until it's time for me to do the dishes.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.420
Sylvia, let me take care of the dishes.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.219
My butler, Geoffrey,
can be here in 15 minutes. Ha-ha.

14:22.228 --> 14:25.322
How about if we do them together?

14:25.497 --> 14:27.897
Then what'll Geoffrey do?

14:33.973 --> 14:38.171
Hey, look. It's a little turkey
from the little turkey. Heh-heh.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.141
A turkey? Hardly.

14:40.312 --> 14:42.303
In point of fact, it's a Cornish game hen.

14:42.481 --> 14:47.919
A flightless bird hale from the Isle of Wight.
Braised in cognac with a hint of fennel.

14:48.087 --> 14:50.851
A fitting end for a noble fowl.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.751
You're kind of weird.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.584
So you want one or not?

14:57.763 --> 15:00.357
No, I probably shouldn't have one,
Mr. Wilmore said...

15:00.532 --> 15:01.829
You know what?

15:02.501 --> 15:04.162
This one's on me.

15:04.603 --> 15:07.902
Cool.
So you gonna be here over Christmas?

15:09.608 --> 15:11.235
Yeah.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.580
Sorry, we're late.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.955
This is going to make a great holiday piece,
Hilary. The public eats up this kind of stuff.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.686
Oh.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.696
- Oh. I'm sorry, I don't think so.
- What?

15:38.170 --> 15:41.298
I exploit people every day of the week
on my show.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.965
It's Thanksgiving,
I'm gonna take the day off.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.578
Well, I hope the fire's still burning.

15:51.450 --> 15:54.385
- That was really something.
- I know.

15:54.553 --> 15:56.282
I wasn't the least bit opportunistic.

15:56.455 --> 16:00.255
For the first time in my life,
I thought about others instead of myself.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.792
Ooh. I'm tingling all over.

16:03.662 --> 16:06.995
- I'm really proud of you, Hil.
- Oh, thank you.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.067
So are you gonna tear up
that letter of recommendation?

16:16.709 --> 16:19.906
Oh, Carlton, I'm so proud of you too.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.721
Judge Banks.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.121
Shh.

16:40.432 --> 16:42.263
I'm really sorry, Your Honor.

16:42.434 --> 16:46.165
Yeah. Just tell your boy
he'd better be at the next march.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.467
Your limo is here and it's ready
to take you and your nephew home.

16:50.642 --> 16:54.339
There's no charges, there's no publicity,
and there's no reporters.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.673
No hard feelings?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.512
No chance.

17:04.356 --> 17:05.380
Hey, Banks?

17:06.892 --> 17:09.019
You done all right for yourself, man.

17:12.964 --> 17:16.423
- Take care of yourself, Tiny.
- I'll see you on the outside, brother.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.332
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Same to you.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.337
Let's get the hell out of here.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.874
Oh, hey,
what are we gonna tell Aunt Viv?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.808
Will, Will,
here's another very important lesson.

17:27.980 --> 17:31.643
When you have a chronic back problem
and you go for a therapeutic massage...

17:31.817 --> 17:35.253
...and wind up in a house of ill-repute,
which is subsequently raided...

17:35.421 --> 17:38.049
...and you are arrested by mistake...

17:38.223 --> 17:42.250
...never tell your wife. Hmm? Poof.

17:42.661 --> 17:47.655
Oh, you are definitely the master.
Let's go get some of them tiny onions.

17:55.908 --> 18:00.470
I tell you, I really feel like I connected with
those people down at the shelter today.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.739
When I reached out to them,
they reached back.

18:03.715 --> 18:07.742
Of course, I stepped out of the way
so they couldn't actually touch me...

18:08.987 --> 18:11.478
...but I really connected.

18:11.690 --> 18:12.850
So, what'd you guys do?

18:13.392 --> 18:14.518
Uh...

18:14.693 --> 18:18.424
<i>- Nothing.
- Yeah, nada, nadie, nil, nilch, nothing...</i>

18:18.597 --> 18:19.928
Ah! Look at the bird!

18:21.400 --> 18:23.493
You've outdone yourself, Geoffrey.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.534
- It looks good.
- Yeah, right here.

18:25.704 --> 18:28.298
Big bird. Big bird.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.806
- That is beautiful.
- It smells delicious.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.536
Okay, everyone,
let's join hands for the prayer.

18:36.715 --> 18:39.878
Dear Lord,
thank you for our many blessings.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.919
Thank you for our health.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.446
Thank you for this food.

18:44.623 --> 18:48.184
But most of all, thank you
for keeping us safe and delivering us from...

18:48.360 --> 18:49.987
Tiny.

18:51.096 --> 18:54.623
Tiny, as well as larger temptations.

18:54.800 --> 18:59.669
And thank you for bringing
this family together in love and peace.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.772
- Amen.
Amen.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.799
A- woman.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.637
Oh...

19:05.811 --> 19:08.780
- Let us get to grubbing.
- Oh, yes.

19:59.431 --> 20:01.023
- Oh, man.
- That was all so good.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.601
- That was the best Thanksgiving ever.
- Absolutely.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.967
So, what about the stuffing?

20:07.472 --> 20:09.736
Oh, it was delicious.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.334
Everything was delicious.

20:15.047 --> 20:21.418
Everything was exactly as delicious
as everything else.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.386
So, honey, which one did you like best?

20:33.432 --> 20:35.491
Like you're a young boy, right?

20:35.667 --> 20:38.067
You're not gonna tell me
which one you liked better?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.670
- Nope.
- Nope.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.972
What about you guys?

20:42.140 --> 20:43.505
Nope.

20:43.675 --> 20:46.166
Then why did we bust our butts
cooking all day...

20:46.345 --> 20:48.677
...if you're not gonna give us an answer?
- Really.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.975
Because that's all part of the fun
of Thanksgiving.

20:53.051 --> 20:57.420
I guess it was kind of fun when Vy dropped
that bag of powdered sugar all over Helen.

20:59.024 --> 21:02.323
Yeah, that was not funny to me.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.758
And I'll never forget
the look on Vivian's face...

21:04.930 --> 21:07.865
...when she got her apron caught
in the food processor.

21:09.701 --> 21:14.263
Yeah, talk about being led around
by your apron strings.

21:15.374 --> 21:18.832
It was even fun giving you guys
a hard time all day.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.705
It doesn't matter
whose stuffing was best...

21:24.883 --> 21:27.875
...it was just fun
being in that kitchen together. Oh.

21:28.053 --> 21:30.283
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, I love y'all too...

21:30.455 --> 21:32.946
...but the bottom line is
my stuffing was the best.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.923
Any fool can see that. You tasted it.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.562
You tasted it with your own mouth.

21:38.730 --> 21:43.394
Slaving in that...
No, I was slaving in that kitchen all day.

21:43.902 --> 21:46.496
I know who I am.
I don't care if y'all leave the table.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.936
Happy Thanksgiving to you too.

21:49.107 --> 21:52.008
Every man I cook for likes what I cook.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.736
That's right. I'm all right.

21:54.913 --> 21:59.179
I'm getting out of here. Hah.
I'm going somewhere for Christmas. Hah.
