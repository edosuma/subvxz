Banana, Sheriff?

00:10.289 --> 00:12.157
How about a banana, Sheriff?

00:12.191 --> 00:15.160
A banana? That does sound good.

00:15.194 --> 00:17.195
What's wrong with my bananas?

00:19.165 --> 00:20.899
Oh. Right.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.805
Dear God, a suspicious package!

Banana, Sheriff?

Don't rush it.

Damn it, he got spooked!

01:51.957 --> 01:55.226
I can't believe the Bazooka
Sharks made the playoffs!

01:55.261 --> 01:57.762
That's what the five-week
regular season was all about.

01:57.796 --> 01:58.796
3-2, baby!

01:58.831 --> 02:01.199
Sure there's no extra ticket?

02:01.233 --> 02:02.433
Damn sure...

02:02.468 --> 02:04.369
- that there is one.
- What?!

02:04.403 --> 02:06.537
And it's going to my boy, Steve.

02:06.572 --> 02:08.538
Why would you bring me?

02:08.574 --> 02:11.743
Yeah!Nobody loves
the 'Zooks more than Klaus!

02:11.777 --> 02:14.212
I <i>bleed silver and ocean lime.</i>

02:14.246 --> 02:15.580
Klaus, you're not coming

02:15.614 --> 02:17.415
because you're wearing a t-shirt jersey.

02:20.085 --> 02:25.123
Oh. The guy at Marshalls
said this was the real deal.

02:25.157 --> 02:26.891
Dad, take the fish.

02:26.925 --> 02:29.494
I'm almost through my annual
re-read of "The Joy Luck Club."

02:29.528 --> 02:31.429
No, Steve, I need a human torso.

02:31.463 --> 02:32.764
Dick has community service,

02:32.798 --> 02:34.766
so you have to step in as our "A."

02:34.800 --> 02:37.268
"R"? "A"?

02:37.303 --> 02:39.604
What's the team name, the Ragamuffins?

02:39.638 --> 02:41.673
Yeah, Marshalls customer service,
please.

02:41.707 --> 02:44.208
It doesn't exist?!

02:48.314 --> 02:50.948
So we're just gonna hang
out in the parking lot

02:50.983 --> 02:52.283
for three hours before the game?

02:52.318 --> 02:53.351
No, Steve.

02:53.385 --> 02:55.119
We're also gonna pound Jagerbombs

02:55.154 --> 02:57.488
and maybe get into a fist fight
with a middle-aged woman.

02:57.523 --> 02:58.990
It's called tailgating.

02:59.024 --> 03:00.291
Excellent!

03:00.326 --> 03:02.760
You brought the child, as we discussed.

03:05.297 --> 03:07.265
What are you doing?! Stop it!

03:07.299 --> 03:09.600
Look at that blank canvas.

03:09.635 --> 03:11.102
- Dad?
- Wait!

03:11.136 --> 03:13.604
Steve's right.
If anyone's gonna spray his "A,"

03:13.639 --> 03:15.807
it should be his father.

03:15.841 --> 03:19.444
Tickets! Tickets!
Need tickets, I got 'em.

03:19.478 --> 03:20.778
Have tickets, I want 'em.

03:20.813 --> 03:22.246
Thanks, Roger, but we're good.

03:22.246 --> 03:24.949
Got a great pair on the 50-yard line,
handicapped zone.

03:24.983 --> 03:26.451
Need a wheelchair, I got it.

03:26.485 --> 03:28.019
Have a wheelchair, I want it.

03:28.053 --> 03:30.455
Need a high-protein snack on the go?
Try walnuts!

03:30.489 --> 03:31.789
Eh, we're just here for the tailgate.

03:31.824 --> 03:33.157
We don't really care about football.

03:33.192 --> 03:34.826
Oh, I can make you care.

03:34.860 --> 03:36.828
You just need a little skin in the game.

03:36.862 --> 03:38.229
- What?
- I'll take that action.

03:38.263 --> 03:40.064
Put you down for a dime on the Sharks.

03:40.099 --> 03:41.399
A dime on the Sharks?

03:41.433 --> 03:42.834
Smart bet. They got a lot of heat

03:42.868 --> 03:44.202
coming out of the regular season.

03:44.236 --> 03:46.871
3-2, baby!

03:46.905 --> 03:48.373
This is gonna be incredible.

03:48.407 --> 03:50.007
Been looking forward to it all week...

03:50.042 --> 03:51.342
The game, not the pee.

03:51.377 --> 03:52.844
I peed a couple days ago.

03:54.413 --> 03:57.081
Remember to toss a penny
in before you leave.

03:57.116 --> 03:59.217
Ew! That splashed me!

03:59.251 --> 04:01.452
Dude, that's eight months of good luck!

04:01.487 --> 04:03.154
Could you move down a little bit?

04:03.188 --> 04:04.856
Oh, I'm the weirdo.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.892
You haven't peed a drop the
whole time I've been watching.

04:11.152 --> 04:12.552
When's the game gonna start?

04:12.587 --> 04:14.921
Not until Sky Crooner says it does.

04:14.956 --> 04:17.224
It's game time, honey!

04:17.257 --> 04:21.394
♪ I've been waiting all
day for Saturday at noon ♪

04:21.428 --> 04:22.629
Whoa!

04:22.663 --> 04:25.065
Whoo! Ohh!

04:25.099 --> 04:28.435
Some say the ropes don't keep
him from falling to the Earth,

04:28.469 --> 04:30.904
but rather, from flying to the heavens.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.140
Some say.

04:33.174 --> 04:34.741
Take his head off!

04:34.776 --> 04:36.443
- Kill him!
- Slit his throat!

04:43.818 --> 04:46.653
That was savage! I-Is he all right?!

04:55.897 --> 04:57.464
He's dead?!

04:57.498 --> 04:59.733
Welcome to the Sharks' nest, baby!

04:59.767 --> 05:01.234
Mama, you like this?

05:01.269 --> 05:04.237
Hell, yeah,
I like Sharks' ball on the 30.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.645
The Dreyer's Ice Cream-A-Torium?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.280
We get a free scoop at half-time.

05:13.314 --> 05:14.781
The widow picks the flavor.

05:14.816 --> 05:16.550
Here comes Johnny!

05:20.321 --> 05:21.655
The quarterback.

05:21.689 --> 05:25.625
That's Juan Consuelo,
A.K.A. Johnny Concussion.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.360
Without a doubt, the greatest player

05:27.395 --> 05:30.297
in arena football history... Probably.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.199
No one keeps records.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.418
Dad, Mr. Concussion isn't moving.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.919
Is he dead, too?

05:52.954 --> 05:54.254
Brain dead, maybe.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.856
Real dead, no way.

05:55.890 --> 05:58.258
Johnny Concussion always gets back up.

05:58.292 --> 06:02.129
<i>Bazooka Sharks fans,
looks like Johnny's out cold.</i>

06:02.163 --> 06:05.499
<i>Let's help him shake out those cobwebs!</i>

06:18.913 --> 06:20.747
See? He's totally fine.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.015
This is barbaric.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.683
And you're cheering for it.

06:23.718 --> 06:25.218
I think I'm gonna be sick.

06:26.287 --> 06:28.688
Do you have something
with the essence of ginger

06:28.723 --> 06:31.024
or anything to settle a rumbly tumbly?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.692
I got a 'Zooka Zinger.

06:32.727 --> 06:34.861
That's Goldschlager and Mountain Dew.

06:34.896 --> 06:37.030
Maybe just some nachos.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.566
And take your time, I'm in no rush to...

06:39.600 --> 06:41.201
Johnny Concussion?!

06:41.235 --> 06:45.038
Excuse me, young lady,
could you point me toward the field?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.240
The field?
What... What's wrong with you?

06:47.275 --> 06:48.875
You almost died on the field.

06:48.910 --> 06:50.544
Yeah, the field.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.212
That's where Johnny goes.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.915
Do you have any idea what
concussions do to your brain?

06:54.949 --> 06:56.583
They're killing you!

06:56.617 --> 06:59.886
You're looking at me.
Am I supposed to do something?

06:59.921 --> 07:01.288
Am I supposed to throw a football?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.428
<i>Johnny!</i>

07:03.629 --> 07:04.629
Where did you go?

07:04.630 --> 07:06.680
Your team needs ya.

07:06.681 --> 07:09.131
Okay, Johnny. You want
to get back to the field?

07:09.299 --> 07:10.332
Right through here.

07:11.748 --> 07:14.191
I can't go back without my Johnny.

07:16.023 --> 07:17.534
Anyone care for a nacho?

07:17.617 --> 07:19.151
Oh, Steve, it's terrible!

07:19.185 --> 07:20.819
Johnny Concussion is missing.

07:20.853 --> 07:23.955
Oh, no! They're putting
in the backup quarterback,

07:23.990 --> 07:25.824
Donny Forfeit!

07:25.858 --> 07:27.459
Don't do it, Donny!

07:27.493 --> 07:30.796
I got to do it! I don't have a choice!

07:30.830 --> 07:31.997
Red 42.

07:32.031 --> 07:33.532
Omaha!

07:35.091 --> 07:36.468
<i>Sharks forfeit!</i>

07:36.502 --> 07:38.336
Why did we draft him?!

07:38.371 --> 07:40.305
The season's over!

07:40.339 --> 07:42.174
Steve, tell me the truth.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.815
Did they write two letters
on me because I'm fat?

07:47.873 --> 07:49.697
<i>Last night after the Pizza Rockets</i>

07:49.698 --> 07:52.467
<i>defeated the Bazooka Sharks,
the town of Aberdeen</i>

07:52.501 --> 07:54.269
<i>came together for a night of terrifying,</i>

07:54.303 --> 07:55.770
<i>but well-deserved rioting.</i>

07:55.804 --> 07:57.272
This is shameful.

07:57.306 --> 07:59.641
That should be our
elementary school on fire.

07:59.675 --> 08:02.410
I can't believe Johnny
Concussion disappeared

08:02.444 --> 08:03.912
in the middle of the game.

08:03.946 --> 08:04.879
Yeah, that's weird.

08:04.879 --> 08:07.248
But it's a mystery we
don't have time to solve.

08:07.283 --> 08:09.617
What, with indoor lacrosse
season only a month off.

08:09.652 --> 08:11.786
Laser Rats, baby!

08:11.820 --> 08:14.923
I bleed tangerine and razzmatazz-red!

08:14.957 --> 08:16.424
Lacrosse is for girls.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.759
You're a girl.

08:17.793 --> 08:20.128
Look! They found Johnny Concussion!

08:20.162 --> 08:23.464
Johnny, your surprise mid-game
retirement shocked everyone.

08:23.499 --> 08:24.933
Take us through your decision.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.435
Honestly, I-I didn't make the decision.

08:27.469 --> 08:29.103
My guardian a-angel did.

08:29.138 --> 08:30.638
Guardian angel?

08:30.673 --> 08:32.140
Oh, yeah.

08:32.174 --> 08:34.375
My angel said concussions
were killing me,

08:34.409 --> 08:36.177
and I had to stop playing.

08:36.211 --> 08:39.547
He had angel glasses and a
high-pitched angel voice.

08:39.581 --> 08:41.849
I'm gonna be late for school.

08:41.884 --> 08:44.152
It was this <i>little</i> baby

08:44.186 --> 08:48.022
with a giant "A" painted
on his little, baby chest.

08:49.591 --> 08:52.493
So, the hunt is on for
Johnny's guardian angel.

08:52.528 --> 08:55.396
Wait, I'm receiving word
that it's Steve Smith.

08:55.431 --> 08:56.764
Thanks, Francine!

08:56.799 --> 08:59.467
It's your fault our season's over?

09:00.924 --> 09:02.603
I just gave him the facts!

09:02.638 --> 09:03.938
You should leave, Steve.

09:03.973 --> 09:05.840
And come back right after school?

09:05.874 --> 09:08.810
'Cause I'll always be loved here?

09:08.844 --> 09:11.646
Hey, Steve? Since I'll never
see your bitch ass again,

09:11.680 --> 09:13.348
I might as well tell you.

09:13.382 --> 09:17.318
I'm the one who snaked all
your Kit-Kats last Halloween.

09:23.192 --> 09:24.993
I'm choking!

09:25.027 --> 09:30.331
Steve, my dearest friend,
you must save me!

09:30.366 --> 09:33.067
In a school fire,
you got to know what you want,

09:33.102 --> 09:35.336
'cause the clock is ticking,
but I nailed it.

09:35.371 --> 09:36.838
I got an overheard projector,

09:36.872 --> 09:38.906
a hand turkey by Emily C.,

09:38.941 --> 09:41.876
and two dozen smoke-damaged
copies of "Hatchet."

09:41.910 --> 09:44.078
You were a part of
those riots in Aberdeen?

09:44.113 --> 09:46.547
A part? How dare you?!

09:46.582 --> 09:48.616
I picked the targets, I set the fires...

09:48.650 --> 09:50.118
I was an integral part!

09:50.152 --> 09:52.587
Oh, okay, yeah, I was a part,
but I was excited.

09:52.621 --> 09:54.956
It's not every day you
win a big sports bet.

09:54.990 --> 09:57.091
Oh, right. I owe you a dime.

09:57.126 --> 09:58.593
Just grab it out of the change bowl.

09:58.627 --> 10:00.928
Is there a thousand
dollars cash in that bowl,

10:00.963 --> 10:03.431
'cause that's what a dime
is in gambler's lingo.

10:03.465 --> 10:04.732
Who knows that?!

10:04.767 --> 10:06.467
Everyone knows that, babe.

10:06.502 --> 10:08.403
I thought you were
crazy to make that bet.

10:08.437 --> 10:09.971
I almost said something.

10:10.005 --> 10:12.106
I'll never be able to pay
you a thousand dollars.

10:12.141 --> 10:14.142
Sure you will. And here's how.

10:14.176 --> 10:16.778
Whoa! We were just in the kitchen!

10:16.812 --> 10:19.113
You put a taxi meter in my car?!

10:19.148 --> 10:21.783
Yep, and you're gonna pay
me back for that, too.

10:21.817 --> 10:24.652
But... I don't want to be a cab driver.

10:24.686 --> 10:26.187
If it makes you feel any better,

10:26.221 --> 10:29.957
behind the wheel of every taxi
is a sad, confused person

10:29.992 --> 10:32.660
who was tricked into a bet
they didn't understand.

10:32.694 --> 10:34.328
You're on the clock
for the next 10 hours.

10:34.363 --> 10:37.298
Here's a pee cup and some
rigatoni I made last week.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.966
I would try to eat it today.

10:39.001 --> 10:41.502
There's no visible mold,
but things are happening.

10:44.907 --> 10:46.407
Sorry I'm late.

10:46.442 --> 10:48.376
A principal in a Bazooka Sharks jersey

10:48.410 --> 10:51.012
stopped me in the hall,
ate my entire bag lunch,

10:51.046 --> 10:53.281
and then told me my
mama's cooking sucks.

10:56.218 --> 10:58.186
Things are getting
a little hot for me, boys.

10:58.220 --> 11:00.021
But as long as we all stick together,

11:00.055 --> 11:02.190
you'll be able to absorb
some of that heat.

11:02.224 --> 11:03.791
- Follow me?
- I don't think so.

11:03.826 --> 11:05.359
I said it in a weird way.

11:05.394 --> 11:08.162
Picture this...
The whole town is freezing me out, boys.

11:08.197 --> 11:09.697
We can't help you, Steve!

11:09.731 --> 11:12.700
- We're huge Johnny Concussion fans!
- What?!

11:12.734 --> 11:15.036
Johnny has a half-Asian girlfriend,

11:15.070 --> 11:17.138
and I respect the hell out of that.

11:17.586 --> 11:19.232
_

11:19.233 --> 11:21.885
_

11:22.211 --> 11:24.545
The <i>dad</i> is Asian, Steve.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.380
Do you understand that?!

11:27.783 --> 11:31.018
Is this the girlfriend's parents'
wedding photo?

11:31.053 --> 11:32.854
I mean, is it sold in stores?

11:32.888 --> 11:34.388
This is the dad.

11:34.591 --> 11:36.791
_

11:36.812 --> 11:38.359
Here we are at the museum.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.261
- Wonderful!
- And you owe me...

11:40.295 --> 11:41.696
nothing for the ride,

11:41.730 --> 11:43.030
since you won't let
me turn the meter on.

11:43.065 --> 11:44.065
Right, right, right, right, right.

11:44.099 --> 11:45.533
You need <i>paying</i> customers

11:45.567 --> 11:47.235
to pay me back, right. Obviously.

11:47.269 --> 11:50.104
I'll get out of your hair.

11:50.139 --> 11:52.640
- 138 and Lex.
- _

11:55.110 --> 11:57.712
So, you drive a cab, huh? That's cool.

11:57.746 --> 11:59.413
I love to dance.

11:59.448 --> 12:01.516
I love to feel people's eyes on me.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.718
I had a little bit to drink tonight.

12:03.752 --> 12:05.553
Ahh!

12:05.587 --> 12:07.388
Long Island ice teas, right?

12:07.422 --> 12:10.358
They're so sweet,
but the boys keep buying them for me.

12:10.392 --> 12:12.860
If my fiancé knew,
he'd kill all of them.

12:12.895 --> 12:14.762
He's Dominican. He's crazy.

12:14.796 --> 12:16.063
The sex is good, though.

12:16.098 --> 12:18.733
He calls me his little Chihuahua.

12:18.767 --> 12:22.403
When I was a kid,
my dad beat the shit out of me.

12:25.274 --> 12:26.574
Hey, thanks for reaching out to us.

12:26.608 --> 12:27.730
Happy to have you on our show.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.578
Well, I just wanted a chance
to tell my side of the story.

12:30.612 --> 12:32.580
I think you're doing the right thing.

12:32.614 --> 12:35.816
Welcome back to The Fist,
Langley's home for sports radio,

12:35.851 --> 12:37.485
where I'm joined by Steve Smith,

12:37.519 --> 12:39.587
the little bastard who
tricked Johnny Concussion

12:39.621 --> 12:41.255
- into retiring.
- Oh, what?!

12:41.290 --> 12:43.424
Can you pinpoint the exact moment

12:43.458 --> 12:46.260
you decided to destroy the
very fabric of this community?

12:46.295 --> 12:47.995
I wasn't trying to destroy anything.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.264
He was wandering around in a daze.

12:50.299 --> 12:52.300
- Because you drugged him.
- No!

12:52.334 --> 12:53.668
I didn't give Johnny any drugs!

12:53.702 --> 12:55.670
Because you needed
them all for yourself.

12:55.704 --> 12:57.405
If you're just joining us,
Steve Smith is here,

12:57.439 --> 12:58.739
and he's high on the drugs

12:58.774 --> 13:00.942
he was planning to use
on Johnny Concussion.

13:00.976 --> 13:02.743
None of that is true!

13:02.778 --> 13:05.079
I just helped a guy
who was in bad shape!

13:05.113 --> 13:06.914
Any decent person would have done it!

13:06.949 --> 13:09.317
Mike in Lanceston,
what's your two cents?

13:09.351 --> 13:11.986
Uh, yeah, I think
it's too bad the boy's on drugs,

13:12.020 --> 13:14.655
'cause I want him to feel
what I'm gonna do to him.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.324
Strong take, Mike. Stay on the line,

13:16.358 --> 13:18.659
we're gonna hook you up with
some Laser Rats tickets.

13:18.694 --> 13:20.928
Oh, my God! I'm going to the Rat Hive!

13:20.963 --> 13:23.164
Randy, what do you think of Steve Smith?

13:23.198 --> 13:24.632
Hate him. Want to murder him.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.267
No one needs to die.

13:26.301 --> 13:29.170
Not me, not Johnny. It's just a game!

13:29.204 --> 13:31.205
Just a game? Really?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.474
Was World War II just a game?

13:33.508 --> 13:35.009
My grandfather was born in the '40s,

13:35.043 --> 13:37.645
so I find what you're suggesting
deeply offensive.

13:37.679 --> 13:39.680
Caller, can you reason with this animal?

13:39.715 --> 13:41.716
Steve Smith is a scumbag!

13:41.750 --> 13:42.592
Mom?

13:43.518 --> 13:46.520
I'm done! This town
has gone completely insane!

13:46.555 --> 13:49.490
If anyone wants to
continue the conversation,

13:49.524 --> 13:51.859
Steve will be leaving
by our southeast exit

13:51.893 --> 13:53.661
- in about 30 seconds.
- Hurry up!

13:53.695 --> 13:55.162
Where am I gonna go?
Where am I gonna go?!

13:58.187 --> 13:58.933
Me, too!

14:02.137 --> 14:04.705
That's the boy we agreed to kill!

14:04.740 --> 14:06.307
Aah!

14:15.017 --> 14:16.817
Dad!

14:16.852 --> 14:19.353
Drive the boy towards me!

14:19.388 --> 14:21.355
Kill! Kill!

14:23.725 --> 14:25.559
It's fine. First time throwing a bolo,

14:25.594 --> 14:27.328
not gonna beat myself up for missing.

14:27.362 --> 14:29.096
It's important to try new weapons.

14:36.071 --> 14:37.438
Can I help you?

14:37.472 --> 14:38.706
Is it possible to mail a human

14:38.740 --> 14:40.274
to the other side of the world?

14:40.309 --> 14:42.209
It is the policy of Packages Etc.

14:42.244 --> 14:43.911
to not ship humans.

14:43.945 --> 14:45.613
But since you are not human,

14:45.647 --> 14:47.248
but in fact, human garbage,

14:47.282 --> 14:49.383
I'd love to put you in a box.

14:49.418 --> 14:51.285
All right, you said your piece.
Just ship me.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.887
How does overnight sound?

14:52.921 --> 14:55.222
Probably my best chance
of getting there alive.

14:55.257 --> 14:56.791
Well, that's not how you're going.

14:58.039 --> 14:59.962
_

15:02.230 --> 15:04.532
Phew! Just a white devil.

15:04.566 --> 15:07.702
Everyone can go back to handing
each other different fruits!

15:07.736 --> 15:09.503
<i>Okay, Steve,</i>

15:09.538 --> 15:13.207
<i>this is your only chance
to make a first impression.</i>

15:13.241 --> 15:16.744
I'm here!

15:20.223 --> 15:21.925
Where are you from, Box Boy?

15:22.009 --> 15:25.645
I come from a land far, far away,

15:25.679 --> 15:28.615
many moons across the great sea.

15:28.649 --> 15:31.317
A place called America.

15:31.352 --> 15:33.253
I know where the United States is.

15:33.287 --> 15:34.821
We're not primitives.

15:34.855 --> 15:36.923
Oh, you'll needed to get
fitted for a dick pouch.

15:36.957 --> 15:40.093
No need.
I'm exactly the size of a "C" battery.

15:40.127 --> 15:41.694
Boy, this is great!

15:41.729 --> 15:44.330
I'm getting away from a
very fraught situation,

15:44.365 --> 15:47.534
so chilling out and enjoying
a little island life

15:47.568 --> 15:49.002
is just what I need.

15:49.036 --> 15:51.738
On this island, everybody works!

15:54.508 --> 15:55.975
Baskets.

15:56.010 --> 15:57.744
Hmm.

15:57.778 --> 16:00.079
So what am I, the distribution guy?

16:00.114 --> 16:01.247
Get them into stores?

16:01.282 --> 16:02.982
No, no, you make the baskets.

16:03.017 --> 16:04.751
I don't have any training.

16:04.785 --> 16:06.753
I'm still kind of a little boy.

16:06.787 --> 16:07.954
Come on. It's easy.

16:07.988 --> 16:10.356
Over, under, over, under.

16:47.772 --> 16:48.595
Finished.

16:49.897 --> 16:54.100
Hmm. If I could give you
some criticism, it's a little small.

16:54.134 --> 16:55.868
Also, it took you three months.

16:55.903 --> 16:57.971
Oh, while I got you here, Magunga,

16:58.005 --> 17:00.306
I wanted to put in a vacation request.

17:00.341 --> 17:02.175
Oh, when were you thinking?

17:02.209 --> 17:04.644
Any couple of days within the next...

17:04.678 --> 17:06.045
Can't do it.

17:12.086 --> 17:14.721
<i>I hadn't seen my brother in months.</i>

17:14.755 --> 17:16.888
<i>Almost forgotten his face.</i>

17:16.924 --> 17:19.058
<i>The streets were becoming my brother.</i>

17:19.093 --> 17:20.993
Hayley, you paid me off two days ago.

17:21.028 --> 17:22.194
You don't have to keep dr...

17:22.229 --> 17:24.530
<i>But I did have to keep driving.</i>

17:24.565 --> 17:26.432
<i>Because as I was saying,</i>

17:26.467 --> 17:28.701
<i>the streets were becoming my brother.</i>

17:28.736 --> 17:30.403
<i>It had been days</i>

17:30.437 --> 17:33.773
<i>since Hayley watched
"Master Chef Jr" with me.</i>

17:33.807 --> 17:35.875
<i>I told her I'd wait for her,</i>

17:35.909 --> 17:38.044
<i>but I didn't. I couldn't.</i>

17:38.078 --> 17:40.079
<i>Peyton made a souffle.</i>

17:40.114 --> 17:42.282
<i>Eight years old, making a souffle.</i>

17:42.316 --> 17:44.117
<i>Imagine that.</i>

17:50.591 --> 17:52.558
Okay, can I just say something?

17:52.593 --> 17:55.161
I know one of you ate my fish,

17:55.195 --> 17:56.763
and it's bumming me out a little bit

17:56.797 --> 17:58.031
because I wrote my name...

17:59.733 --> 18:03.069
Oh, I just bent a reed
on my base stitch.

18:03.103 --> 18:05.238
Is it me, or is management giving us

18:05.272 --> 18:07.040
a lot of dry reeds lately?

18:07.074 --> 18:09.442
Forget work! The volcano's active!

18:09.476 --> 18:12.461
Oh, will it kill us all?
That might be nice.

18:13.580 --> 18:15.615
If you're looking to sacrifice a virgin,

18:15.649 --> 18:17.250
your prayers have been answered.

18:17.284 --> 18:19.252
No, it's boulder-pushing season.

18:19.286 --> 18:22.422
Every time the volcano erupts,
each village sends

18:22.456 --> 18:27.293
the strongest man,
and they race to push a boulder into it.

18:27.328 --> 18:29.128
Does that, like, stop it from exploding?

18:29.163 --> 18:30.663
No, it's just fun!

18:30.698 --> 18:32.632
Micah's from our village.

18:35.336 --> 18:37.270
Hey, I've seen him around.

18:37.304 --> 18:38.805
I'm Team Micah!

18:53.153 --> 18:55.788
Wow! The volcano is so steep!

18:55.823 --> 18:57.724
I can't believe how strong they are.

18:57.758 --> 18:59.926
Uh-oh! Our boy's in trouble.

19:07.184 --> 19:08.267
Aah!

19:08.302 --> 19:09.469
Oh, no!

19:11.638 --> 19:12.939
Aah!

19:12.973 --> 19:15.141
Yeah, Micah! Kill him!

19:28.522 --> 19:31.124
We did it! We won!

19:31.158 --> 19:32.825
Look how excited everyone is.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.995
And why?
'Cause they're not basket-weaving.

19:36.029 --> 19:38.364
I get it now.

19:38.399 --> 19:41.501
People spend all day at work.

19:41.535 --> 19:46.005
The daily grind, the rat race,
the old punch-in, punch-out.

19:46.039 --> 19:49.409
And the only relief is the
promise of the weekend.

19:49.443 --> 19:51.844
When you get together
with your sad friends,

19:51.879 --> 19:54.514
numb yourself with enough
vodka to kill a horse,

19:54.548 --> 19:57.049
and watch an athlete do
the physically impossible

19:57.084 --> 20:00.086
or get gravely injured trying.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.522
And that's where you come in,
Johnny Concussion.

20:02.556 --> 20:04.557
Will you strap on the pads again?

20:04.591 --> 20:07.026
Be the shiny something that distracts us

20:07.060 --> 20:08.428
from our crappy lives?

20:10.097 --> 20:13.332
They tell me that's the
ball from my first touchdown.

20:14.768 --> 20:17.136
Okay, kid, I'll do it.

20:17.171 --> 20:19.405
But what about my dead brain?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.007
Okay, kid, I'll do it.

20:22.443 --> 20:24.177
That's my Johnny!

20:26.613 --> 20:29.081
<i>Another late hit!</i>

20:29.116 --> 20:32.785
<i>Johnny really has 'em frustrated.</i>

20:32.820 --> 20:35.488
You did a good thing getting
Johnny back on the field, Steve.

20:35.522 --> 20:36.956
Thanks, Dad.

20:36.990 --> 20:40.293
- And I'm sorry your job makes you so sad.
