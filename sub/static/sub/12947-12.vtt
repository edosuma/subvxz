WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
ANNOUNCER: We now return to

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
"Thugnificent: Rags to Bitches."

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Y'all already know, folks.
Riley Freeman,

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
HUEY: On August 29, 2005,

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
Hurricane Katrina

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
ANNOUNCER: In a world of unspeakable

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
brutality...

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
y'all know what a nigga moment is.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
the Internet hadn't been invented yet.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
A nigga moment is when the mind

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
a.k.a. Young Reezy,
doing it Godzilla-big

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
The story of Thugnificent begins here...

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
So he was still discovering the dangers of online dating.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
struck the Gulf Coast of the United States.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
of a perfectly logical black man

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
is overwhelmed by some stupid nigga shit.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
It's a derogatory,
racial remark

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I love you, Mommy.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
in the projects of Terra-Belle, Georgia,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
here at All-Star Weekend.
Only 8 years old

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
that has divided people
for many years.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
freedom had a name.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Like when a nigga steps up on your sneaker

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
one of the poorest and toughest towns in the country.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Oh!

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
and putting the smack down
on these bitch-ass niggas.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
And that name was Freeman.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
and fucks up your kicks, or hits your car or some shit.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
What's good with you,
planet Earth?

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
And a J. Edgar Hoover
Elementary teacher

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Terra-Belle leads Georgia in homicides, infant mortality,

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
This is your boy, Thugnificent,
representing

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Here he is winning the three-point contest

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Several hours later,

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
MAN: This is our target --
the nuclear power plant.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
And the nigga get mad

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
has now been suspended

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
like it's your fault, like you fucked up.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Terra-Belle, Georgia,
you know what I'm saying?

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
making it rain like Lil' Wayne out this motherfucker.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
residents of New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Catcher Freeman.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
If we capture the plane
at precisely the right moment,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Lethal Interjection
moving next to your home.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
over calling a student
the N-word.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
So his ignorance makes you act crazy.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
AIDS, and everything else bad.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Ooh, Lord.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
reported hearing a loud explosion.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
This is the true story

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Check the chain, nigga.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
Without even taking off his warmups.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Stacy Renee investigates
what happened and why.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yo.
What up?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, you know, in Latin they say

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
they will not have time
to shoot down the aircraft.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
Yo, can you hear me?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
And the next thing you know, niggas is beefing,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
"terra belle" means "beautiful earth."

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
I know y'all love my music,
and love my videos and shit,

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Or his Tims, nigga.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
of the man who risked everything for justice...

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Yeah, I see you, too.
What you want, nigga?

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Then the flood came.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
RENEE:
And what to did he say

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
specifically to you?

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
shooting, fighting, and somebody ends up dead.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
But in Georgia, Terra-Belle means,

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
Damn!

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
but be fully prepared
to drink hella Haterade, nigga.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
He said, "Sit down,
nigger."

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Oh, man, same shit.
What's up with you?

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
"fucked-up place to live."

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
MAN:
If they hit that power plant

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
with that aircraft,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
'Cause y'all about to see
how good it is to be me

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
And later,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
RENEE: Riley Freeman is

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
a third-grade student

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
The fuck you mean,
"What's up with me?"

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Terrible Terra-Belle.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
he busts Vince Carter's ass

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Yes, sir. That's our name for it.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
and how bad it is to be you.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
in the slam-dunk contest.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
at J. Edgar Hoover Elementary School.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
and love.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
the casualties could be
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm sittin' right here
next to you.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Your voice sounds
real sexy right now.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
But yo, not even death can stop a nigga moment.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
We got plenty of hoes bending,
we got 24s spinning.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Look. Look at this right here. Look, look.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
He's a basketball player, an avid reader,

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
God help us all.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Now, this right here is where I grew up.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
In the days and weeks that followed,

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Savior, soldier, killer...

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Say what?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
I seen everything, man. Everything.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
and one day hopes to spread his philosophy

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay. Ready?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
It's Thugnificent's crib,
nigga. Let's roll.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
the nation watched and wondered:

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
You wanna talk to me
later on?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Goddamn!

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
HUEY: The sectarian conflict

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
through rap music.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
No, I don't wanna talk
later on, motherfucker.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I seen a nigga get killed right over there, you know?

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
how could it have all gone so wrong?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
between myself and my brother Riley

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
ANNOUNCER:  ...except...

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
He was in class when he had a verbal exchange

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
...hero.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
They beat him up, stomped him,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Man, I seen it all.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
was heading into its eighth year with no signs of slowing.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
And he was your great--

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
with his teacher, Joe Petto.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
What the fuck's so sexy
about my voice?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
shot the dude, stomped the nigga again,

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Ernie, nigga, back to you.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
GRANDDAD: Great-great-great-granddaddy.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
What? What is this CPT?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
DEVIL: He was the baddest motherfucker

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
that hell had ever seen.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
I like to give haters
something to hate

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
But Mr. Petto said it was Riley who used the N-word first.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Aw, man, my bad.
I was on the phone.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
and then I seen 'em take a dump on the dude.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
right when they
get to the door, nigga.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
This Riley Freeman,
a very exciting

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
None for me,
thanks.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
WOMAN:
That means the plane is gonna

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
get here when it gets here.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Tom, I think you can have

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh, great. You got one of those
ridiculous fuckin' headsets.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I swear to God, man, they actually, like,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
WOMAN: Ding...dong.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
but controversial player.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
The story
of Catcher Freeman.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
a second glass
on your anniversary.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
You know what?
I've had it.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Last year, he became the first person

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
So I told him to take his seat

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
Colonel motherfucking
Stinkmeaner,

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
shot a deuce on this nigga, man.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
GRANDDAD:

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm driving, sweetie-pooh.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Man, I don't know
what you be talking about.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
This sucks.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Don't nobody do it like
this here, nigga.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
to leave elementary school and go to the NBA

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
and here comes
this barrage of insults.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
RILEY:
Come on, Granddad.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
ANNOUNCER: They picked the wrong airline.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Heh. I don't think
one more glass

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
holler at your boy,
I gets money.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
You know what I'm saying? They shat on the nigga, man.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
I may not know nothin'
about history,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Bitches like this shit, man.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
We do it real  grande
around here, man.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
when the Miami Heat signed him to a $3 gazillion contract,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
I mean, some of the words
I've never even heard before.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
And don't come up here
complaining and shit.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
of wine will kill you.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
And I started thinking to myself: "Man...

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What's wrong with you?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
but I ain't stupid.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
They be thinkin' I'm one
of them Mens in Black

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
He trained like a beast.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
You know what's wrong with me.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Ain't nobody
got one of these --

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Boy, see who that is.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
None of that story is true.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You motherfuckers wanna
come on here

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
No, but driving under
the influence of alcohol

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
or somethin' like that,
you know?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
When was this picture
taken? 1964?

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
a doorbell with real bitches
singing the notes.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
And I was just stunned,
and I said,

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and act a goddamn fool?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
the biggest in league history.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
It is true.
Catcher Freeman was a hero.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
could kill me or you,
or somebody's baby.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
They think I got big things
goin' on, you know?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
Y'all gonna have
to kick me out of this bitch.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
You say I don't look like my
picture?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
"Well, sit down,  nigga."

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm about to go on break.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
what did he do to make them niggas that mad?"

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Ding...dong.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
I don't care how much
they pay him, Ernie,

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
And don't you ever forget it.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You motherfucking terrorists
kill me.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Worse yet,

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
They be wondering where
the black limo is at

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
I'm having the time of my life.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm saying you probably never
looked like this damn picture.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Jericho Freeman.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Excuse me.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'd spend the next 20 years
in jail being--

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
That's right, nigga.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
this kid is a disgrace
to basketball.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I just repeated
the insult back to him,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
when they see --
All they see is the headpiece,

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
He was so bad, he even called me,

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh, lookie here,
this is Cousin Jericho.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
BOTH:
Anally raped.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Now, right over here,

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
This ain't you!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Whore-bells.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
He epitomizes everything wrong
with the game today.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
HUEY:
Come back here, Riley.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
because that's what
I've been trained to do.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, let's talk more

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
they assume it's a black limo.
Know what I'm sayin'?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
that's where the police station used to be.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
So is that all
you care about is looks?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
Man, I haven't talked
to Cousin Jericho

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
the devil himself, a--

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Now, Charles, it seems to me
that you're hating on Riley

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
That is not what
he's been trained to do.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
ANNOUNCER:  Come see why black incompetence...

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Hey, hey, shorty!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
about your violated rectum.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah, they must not have liked that location much,

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Huh?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, I find it
so romantic.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Bitch-ass nigga!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
in a long time.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
School Superintendent Donald Richards

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
TOM: Hey, I'm just saying--

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Uh, h-hold up, hold up, hold up.
This the house right here.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
'cause, uh, they up and left.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
because he stacks paper
to the ceiling

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Whoo, whoo!

01:04.000 --> 01:07.000
This is how you break your foot
off in a motherfucker's ass.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, excuse me
for thinking you liked me

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
says all teachers are taught

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Goddamn, that bitch
phat as a motherfucker.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Okay, okay, check it out.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
So where's the new police station?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
and rides on 24-inch chrome.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
to use appropriate hyphenated euphemisms

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
So...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
What? Nigga, there was no more police station after that.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
for who I was on the inside.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, you know, I believe
in investing in the arts.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
...is our funniest weapon in the war on terror.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
n-no wine, then?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Last week, right,
I was in the strip club, right.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Hyah! Hyah!

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Well, you're a liar
on the inside.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Aren't you gonna answer it?
Y'all don't know

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Now let's go back
to my nigga on the floor.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm tired of you two punksters.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
instead of racial slurs.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No, thank you.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Pigs got the fuck up outta here.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
This whole relationship
is based on a lie.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And I believe
in investing in myself.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
All you do is fight, eat
and fuck up my house.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I had titties in one hand,
titties in the other hand.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
That's when they put

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
ANNOUNCER: Man, check out how Young Reezy

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
that part of the family.
They live down in Louisiana.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
We have a very strict policy

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Ah! You baldheaded
devil monks

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
A ugly lie!

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Now, this shit right here,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
You think I wanna deal with
this shit at the end of my life?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
against teachers
using the "N-word,"

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We can't let you through,
homey.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
this big-ass fence up around the city.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
shitted on these niggas in today's game.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
He was in New Orleans
when that flood hit.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, this is Osama bin Laden
nephew, nigga.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
are trying to swarm
on a nigga, huh?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
this is some old John Woo shit,
nigga.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
You know what I'm gonna do?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
or any other
racially insensitive words.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I had two hands
full of titties.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Why in the hell this keep
happening to me?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
This from the movie  Killer.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Here's Riley going up against Kobe Bryant.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm telling you,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I-- I'm --
I'm once removed. I-I--

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
You know what I'm saying?
That's me, though.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
it was a crime how they
treated those folks down there.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Fill the bathtub
with water

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
The district's policy
is that teachers

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
That's bigger
than two scoops of raisins.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
God, what did I do
to deserve this?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
And breaks his ankle.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
and drown both
your little asses.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
No --
I just fucking with you, dawg.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
You just got a two-piece combo
and biscuit, ho.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
So, what was it like

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
This is payback for what?
What did I do to you? Tell me.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
You mad?
You hating, my nigga?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Took their land.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Now, move the hell
out of my way.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
should always say "N-word"
instead of the actual N-word.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
I'm still talkin' to my
accountant at the same time.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
growing up in a place like this?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Look at that bitch-ass nigga limping off the floor.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Go ahead, nigga.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
It was hard, you know? A lot of people don't know

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Well, it's hard
not to, nigga. Ha-ha!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
I heard they didn't even
pay people's insurance.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Still got soap in my ass.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
ANNOUNCER: Starring Gary Anthony Williams.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, oh--
Oh, my gosh.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
What's not to like
about  that?

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Maybe I should leave.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Ooh, no wonder they ride his nuts so hard.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Nigga, you ain't
no Denzel.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Or "S-word" instead of saying
the actual S-word.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But you know what they say --
when it's your time to go,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
that places like this even exist in America.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm telling you, Tom,
they drive women away.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Seems like Yao Ming wants some too.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
And don't nobody
even talk about it anymore.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it's your time to go. John Witherspoon.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Okay. First of all, I don't know
when you talkin' to me

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Hell, you ain't even
no Flavor Flav.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I used to have an exciting life.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
What is the S-word?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
or when you're talkin'
on the goddamn phone.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
They don't know how dirty the South really gets.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Time after time after time.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Get your bitch ass out the way, nigga.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
You see how short
people's memories are?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Have fun, travel.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, I-- I don't wanna
say it, but--

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What if it's the motherfucker
next to me time to go? Huh?

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
You might wanna send
your lady out of the room

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Second, when people
wear those things,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Gotcha, nigga.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Mm-hm.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
There ought to be a law.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Fellas, I'm here with
All-Star MVP Riley Freeman.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Man, I wish there was
something I could do for 'em.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh, drink fine wines.
But not anymore.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Spic?
No, no.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
I see ya.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
GIRL:  Hey! That's a damn shame.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
for this next one, man.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Uh, ahem.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Mo'Nique.
It's very important

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
they appear to be
talkin' to theyselves.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Lock 'em up.
Charge them with fraud.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
She about
to start looking at you

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Boy, get the door.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
TOM:
Ah. Now, that's what

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I like to see.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
There's a name for people
who talk to theyselves, Ed.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I feel it.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
But that's real shit, though, nigga.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I'd be snitching on
ugly women all day.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
like a serious disappointment,
man.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Eighty-seven points,
25 rebounds.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
I can't even go to dinner.
I can't even go to a damn movie.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Spear-chucker.
"Spear-chucker"?

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
this plane leave on time.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Stinkmeaner,
your heart of darkness

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
You got naked kids.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Not just give 'em money,
but actually do something.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I say give them the chair.
Electrocute their ugly asses.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
A living room

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Riley, is there anything
you can't do, nigga?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Yes. See, we would encourage
our teachers to say "S-word"

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Damn. Now, are you yelling
at me or shitting at me?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
They're called the homeless.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
You got parents gotta choose between food and clothes

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
with a motherfucking Jacuzzi,
nigga.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
RILEY: It's Jericho Freeman.
Tell him we're not here!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
I come back,
my house look like Baghdad.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
has earned you a trip back.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Snoop Dogg.
Hijacked?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Man, bitches love this
Bluetooth shit. Changed my life.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
for their kids, shorty.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I'll pull that
switch quick.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I don't know, go broke?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
instead of, ahem,
"spear-chucker."

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Them niggas ain't getting
my wizzie fo' shizzle, nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, my. No, honey,
don't sing. Not again.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You have my blessings
to exact vengeance

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, but there's more,
my nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
If there were just

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I told you before,
you ought to drive them out

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Good one, little brother.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
to the middle of nowhere,

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
I don't know what to do
with my hands now.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
This is the straw
that breaks

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Shaq, 17 blocks for Riley,
you had one.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
anything at all that I could do,
anything to help.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
And how often do you have
a problem with faculty saying

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
RILEY:
That nigga lying.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You know what I'm saying? And 50 Cent

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
A while for me?

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Be that as it may, no technology
is worth my dignity.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
on the Freeman family

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
the haters' camel's back,
nigga.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
leave 'em for dead and
then hope for the very worst.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
And how would you know?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
and to spread
ignorance and chaos

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm a good man.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Granddad always making up
some shit about history.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
as Air Marshal 50 Cent.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
SARAH: Um, Tom. Tom...

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Or for themselves.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
I got hulks
on tap, nigga.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
That's got to make you
feel fucked up.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
Sounds to me
like you need a vacation.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
"spear-chucker" to students?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
If talking on a wireless headset
mean I gotta look

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
in the black community.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
We don't.
That's what I'm saying.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
How come everyone we related to
is somebody famous?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
...people are looking.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It's real out here, nigga.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
It did at first,

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Shit, who you telling?
I need to get my black ass away.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll stop
those terrorists...

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
They will be no match
for you.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Observe.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
then I realized hating
on Riley's superior game

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Tom, please.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
like Buck Rogers,
then I'm not interested.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
They would say "S-word."

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
The first nigga to go
to the moon,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
or die trying.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
doesn't make
my game any better,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Some place
far away and exotic.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
But Riley Freeman denies he used the N-word first.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Besides, there's a reason

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
or the first nigga
to pole vault?

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Honey. Honey, maybe this isn't
the best place to be singing--

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
why people hold the phone
to their head, Ed.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
so guess I have to work harder,
step up to his level.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Absolutely. Splurge.
It's like the rappers say:

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Tsk. Man, he made up
Catcher Freeman.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
He said I used the word
before, but I didn't.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
STINKMEANER:
Ah! Hell ain't shit.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
That's what great players do.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Get ready. This time, it's going down.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
You can't go on

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
It lets people around you know
you're talkin' on the phone.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
They bring the best
out of everyone on the team.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
do it big.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Shoot, he probably made up
this whole "slavery" thing.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I'm gonna get you, Freeman!

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
"Do it big," huh?
I like that.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
I wouldn't use that word ever.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
So he's better than you?

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
So those people know not
to waste time talkin' to you

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
I could go
on a "do it big" trip.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
That word hurts people.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
What nigga you know

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Yes.
And stacks more paper

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Ha-ha. Yeah.
Now you're talking. Yes.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
gonna work all day
in a hot field for no paper?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
This is a hijacking.
Remain in your seats --

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
until you're finished,

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Shit.
This one nigga

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
and gets more ho's
than you, nigga?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Oh, I remember
those proud days

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yay. All done.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
came through here
with his bitch.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
See, that's your problem.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
which you indicate by
puttin' that motherfucker away.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Left with a case
of hate poisoning, nigga.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Absolutely.
And speaking of ho's,

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
marching with
Dr. Martin Luther King.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
We have a bomb on the aircraft.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Every time we come in.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You be believin' anything
somebody tells you

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
You know what
I'm saying? Hey, flo.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
we are also joined
by Riley's grandfather.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
It might be time to bring
Mr. Bitches back out

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Tell 'em about that nigga
that got his spirits crushed

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
We used to hear that
hateful word all the time.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
or put in a...book.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Everyone remain --

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
And manager, thank you.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
to show them young boys
how the real players play.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Good.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
See, I keep my mental mind
extra secure. Nothing gets in.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
by the rubies and the diamonds
and shit.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
He killed hisself, man,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
I see you're fucking up
all your grandson's money.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Robert Jebediah Freeman, Riley's grandfather,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
took his own life and shit,
you know what I mean?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Why, yes, I am,
player-player.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh, yeah, look out.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SARAH:
Yay.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
ED: You know, I like
the way your booty looks

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
says the incident takes him back

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Where you going?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Ah! Oh, my God.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm blowing
through his money so fast,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Mr. Bitches is back
on the scene. Ha, ha, ha.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Don't wanna hear the rest
of the story?

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
when you bend over.
I like that a lot.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Suicide note was some shit
about his ex-girlfriend

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
to the civil rights movement.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
you wouldn't believe it.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, what sad times these are

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
No, I don't wanna hear no more
of your made-up stories.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
What is it, honey?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Very sexy.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
and all of that.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Yesterday, I bought a car
that turns into a boat.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
High-five me. No? Okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait. Is that Usher?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Mm-hm. I can make it
over there later.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
GRANDDAD:
Uh, ah, ooh, ooh.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
I told you,
Catcher Freeman was real.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm about to go
get dressed.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
We all knew
that the shit was about

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, you know what?
You should go to Latin America.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
when educators can
go around willy-nilly,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yes! Oh, my God.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, I'm  real  ready.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Can you believe that? A boat.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
calling our kids
the N-word.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
That's your great-
great-great-great-granddaddy.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh. Mm-hm.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
the diamonds and the rubies
and the Jacuzzi.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You know,
someplace like Costa Rica.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
I hate these
fucking headsets.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Granddad,
you messing up my dream.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
What about when you told us
your cousin integrated baseball?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He's coming over.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Now, this aquatic
adventure park

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Me and my boy have suffered
tremendous unspecified mental

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We gonna fly on the
Soul Plane!

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
is especially for
y'all niggas out there

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I paid for that bed
you sleeping on,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, I can see it now.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I can't believe this.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
so it's my dream too.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
He did.
At school they said

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
with your little
inground pools,

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You should probably wake up
and smell the sheets.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Hey, Robert. Guess who?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Mr. Bitches hitting the clubs all night long.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
and physical damage
from this.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
TOM:
Oh, sweetie,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
you hit the table.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
Mr. Petto claims the version of "nigger" ending in "ger"

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Jackie Robinson
integrated baseball.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
diving boards
or whatever.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
You know you pee the bed.
I do not. Get out of my dream.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Hey, uh, Jericho, is it?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Hey, how you doin', babe?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
GIRL 1:
I think he's in there.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Step your pool game up,
nigga.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't want no handshake.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Get a table in VIP, pop a little Cristal.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
That's your fourth cousin
on my uncle's side.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hi, uh, uh, Mr. Usher.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
GIRL 2: There's probably
gonna be a lot of orgies.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Hey. Oh, ee-- Ee--

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We slide down with ours.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Boy, you out of your mind,
raising your voice at me.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You get here and give
Cousin Jericho a hug.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
is the racial slur, but that he was using

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Jackie Robinson Freeman.
The Freeman is silent.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Uh-- Ah-- Ooh--
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah!

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Call the girls, "Hey, babies--"

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
-I can't believe it.
-It's not true.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I'll beat your little ass
in front of what's-his-name.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
How are you, cous-boy?
How long it been?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
TOM: W-w-wait a minute, Robert.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
a different version of the word, ending in "ga,"

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Now hush and pay attention.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I-- I can't believe
it's you.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
This is, like,
the greatest thing

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Your bitch does.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Get your butt over here,
trying to embarrass me--

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
Ha-ha. I don't think you're
supposed to drink Cristal.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
that means the same as "buddy" or "best pal."

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
Catcher Freeman was
the greatest black man ever.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
that ever happened
in our neighborhood.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It been, what,
four, five years?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm Sarah.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Uh, back to y'all, man.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
He was Malcolm X, Nat Turner
and Barack Obama

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
...where you can, like, track,
like, if someone, like,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
More like 34 years.
Could be 40.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Says who?
Says Jay-Z. It's a boycott.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
He insists that he was using

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You have a beautiful smile,
Sarah.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
all rolled into one.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Mm-hm.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
does anything weird.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Well, shoot.
What the difference, huh?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
The owner said something racial.
I don't know.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
the friendly version of the N-word

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Okay, I'm going to start this story from the beginning.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Mm! Wow, so she's
on my friends list?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
What in the hell?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Now, this right here is what
I like to call my bitch tank,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
to better relate to Riley.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
We family, right,
cousin? Ha, ha.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
What's going on?
What's going on?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, hold on,
I know what he said.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I used the word. I admit it.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
RILEY: Oh, man.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
From the beginning?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Yup, she your very first
cyber friend

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah. Yeah, boy!

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
We family. We're cousins.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
He said, and I quote:

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
GRANDDAD: Shut up.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
It was the plantation

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
A while for me?

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
and this bitch
is Debbie.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
If you say so, second cousin.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
I thought there was a difference
between "nigg-er" and "nigg-a."

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
and you're her 3 millionth.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Well, he's moving in.
Who?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
"I don't want no big nigger lips
drinking my fine wine,"

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
of Confederate Colonel George Lynchwater,

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
SARAH:
I love this song.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
You really should come
to more of

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
She's fine,
ain't she?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Yeah, me and the gang

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah, boy! I love technology.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
better known as Massa Colonel.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
the community council
meetings, Robert.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
And you're sure this is
what she looks like?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
we just passing through
ya'll neck of the woods--

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
and I applaud him for putting
conviction over profit.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
Probably made him up too.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I ain't worried about
no damn council meeting.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, yeah. Your granddaddy
ain't falling

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I thought I understood
this whole thing,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
HUEY: My granddad recently

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
discovered online dating.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Y'all broke niggas keep buying
fish food if you want.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Hi.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Shut your ass! The slaves were out in the fields,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, wonderful.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Tell me who's moving in.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
for the okey-doke
this time.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
--and thought it would
just be too rude of us

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Well, I don't know
if that's what he said,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
but I guess I don't.
I need help.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
singing songs of freedom.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
You should post more pics.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
GIRL 1:
He's coming, you guys!

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Now I got the video chat.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
if we didn't stop by.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Thank you very much.
Oh. Oh, God.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Ho's love pictures,
Granddad.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Everybody get ready!
GIRL 2: Oh, my gosh.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
Hey, don't sweat it, homey.
'Cause when it's time

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
but you're not
supposed to drink it.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Whenever I hear the rappers,
they say "nigga."

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Guys, what--?
What are you doing?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Uh--

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
You know, we've been
pretty much moving around

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
But I wanna drink Cris.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm starting to feel
like Shemar Moore up in here.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Totally, you know.
Like, oh, my gosh.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
to show the world
how the broke niggas live,

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Poor white man.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That was beautiful.
It's just what I do.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
from place to place
since, uh, you know.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
It's in all the music.
Look, look, look.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
You know you're not allowed
to sing that song.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Oh, um, this is,
uh...Tom.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
I think it's a setup.
It don't make no sense.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
maybe MTV will come
to your house,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
He can't have nothing nice
for himself no more.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Hoo! Boy, let's get
some music on.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Get ready, you guys.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
You don't say.
Well, great catching up.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Rap songs that use the word
"nigga" in a positive way.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Stop it, guys, I'm serious.
Massa's on his way.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Why would she like you?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
and it'll be your turn to shine,
but until then,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Turn on the My-pod
and let's get on the I-space.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
GIRL 1:
You guys, he's coming.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
'Cause your granddaddy
gives sweet love.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Polo?
Niggers got to that.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, I'm Tom. Just Tom.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
HUEY:  It was the third house to get robbed

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
RILEY: Wait, wait, wait.
I know that song.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
tell your moms to get off
my dick, nigga.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Thanks for stopping by.
Cheers.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Timberland?
Niggers got to that too.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
There's tons of 'em.
Look: "'Real Nigga Role Call.'

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
COLONEL:
Tobias, didn't I tell you

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
to tell these niggers

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Look, Robert, don't let
the chrome rims fool you, okay?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
GRANDDAD:
Riley, hurry up.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
in Woodcrest in less than a week.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
USHER:
Hey, how

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
you doin'?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
And what do you know
about this woman?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And get the hell up
out of here, bitches.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Mercedes, Versace, white women.
Niggers, niggers, niggers.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
"'Niggas Bleed.'
'Jigga my Nigga.'

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
to stop singing that damn song?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
The police were talking

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Thugnificent!

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Well...her name is Luna.

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
The-- The old Jericho Freeman
clan, we ain't doing so great.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Stop singing? Oh, no.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
to everyone on our street for clues.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
RILEY:
Hey, which outfit

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
you want next, Granddad?

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
"'Niggas for Life.' 'Real Niggas
Don't Die.' 'Shame on a Nigga.'

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
SARAH:
You are so interesting.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
...came from that area
over there, uh, running...

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
She's a Virgo.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Hey, Robert, if you want beef
with the Roc, that's on you.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Tobias told us Massa Colonel
likes that song.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Her hobbies include pets,
traveling, kickbox--

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
We gonna fly on
the  Soul Plane!

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
USHER: You're interesting.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
The leather vest.
The one with the rhinestones.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
Well,  almost  everyone.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And stealing from
desperate old men.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You know, we almost
didn't make it up here.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
'Sucka Nigga.'
'Ain't No Nigga.'"

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
That's a lie.
Oh, no, Massa.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
B-B-B-Booty-Butt cheeks

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Hope the Jigga Man ain't there.
Like I give a damn.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
If you don't
mind me asking,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
...do they gallop still?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Watch when you go to sleep.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
A lot of folks
didn't make it out at all.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
We field niggas
is too dumb to lie.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And make sure you pee
before we leave.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
He had a gallopy gait
to him.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Granddad, I--

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
Ooh. I got the cross,
the cross spin.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Shoot,
I drink what I wanna drink.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
The school is investigating the incident.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I ain't gonna miss my movie

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
where did you learn
to dance like that?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I bet she have a gang of niggas
up in here to rob us.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Mm-hm.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But in the meantime, Mr. Petto has been put on unpaid leave.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
But, you know,
Tobias is the lighter shades,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
going to the bathroom
with you.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I've never seen anyone dance
like Michael Jackson before.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
GIRL: Thugnificent!
Thugnificent, wait!

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Besides,
I packs the heat.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Officer, I'm not finished.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
I can come back.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
That ain't a good look,
Granddad.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
The reverse spin.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yes, we-- We blessed
to escape the deadly waters

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
I wish a nigger would try
to tell me what to drink.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
and he got
that sharp sense of humor.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm gonna let you go in there
by yourself

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Boy, get over here
and take this picture.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and get molested
by a nasty white man.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, I've been dancing
for as long as I remember.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Hello, sir,
I'm Officer Calloway.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
booty-butt cheeks

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Not a good look?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
of Hurricane Katrina
with our lives.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Oh, no, no, Massa Colonel,
I wasn't--

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Is that some kind of
new slang?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Once you pop the Cris,

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I just couldn't believe it,

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
It's not just the music.
I have seen all of your movies.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm here to --
I didn't see nothin',

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Now, what's wrong with you?
Why the long face?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Oh, man!

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
And, uh,
virtually nothing else.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
that's when the pretty señoritas come running

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
because nobody ever
called me a nigger before.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
You out here telling jokes,
Tobias?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What's wrong with you?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't know nothin'.
Cheers.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Is that what's hot
in the street, huh?

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Lean with it, rock with it.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't wanna go to the movie.
Why not?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I had a bad dream
about--

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Thugnificent and the Lethal
Interjections living  here.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
because they know there's a rich American in the room.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Massa Colonel, please.
Ahh! God, that stings!

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't ever wanna go
to the movies with you again.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Really? Even  Light It Up?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Uh...cheers.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
I got the footwork.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
GRANDMOTHER:
Praise Jesus.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
RENEE:
And how did it make you feel?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I loved  Light It Up.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Granddad really didn't know

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Talk and shoot
at the same time, boy.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Is that what you call
really  'hood?

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
Like...I was less
than a person.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
I-I knows you mad,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Not after
what happened last time.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
anything about the break-ins.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Thug who?
Thugnificent.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Behind-the-head catch, yeah.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
TOM: Yeah! I bet our dollar

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
is worth 20 of theirs.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
but don't take it out
on poor Tobias.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I named my dog Light It Up.
Girl, please.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
RILEY:
Granddad, you want

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
"Beat It" or "Thriller"?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Why don't you give her a chance?
You ain't even met her yet.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What happened last time?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
But his unwillingness to talk with the police

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
I can't believe it.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, you know, the important
thing is everyone is okay.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
GRANDDAD: Shoot, all you gotta do

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
is flash a little change.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
If you beats him,
it's like you beating all of us,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We got arrested. And  shot at.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
My mama wouldn't
even see  Light It Up.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Neither have you.
I don't know, Granddad.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
Damn it, boy, have you lost
your natural black mind?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
is a common trait with black people.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Mmm, that's a tough one.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Yeah, we lost everything.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
So funny.
She's my manager.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
GIRL:
Wait up. Wait up.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
A whole weekend with
a complete stranger?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
You wanna play basketball,
you play it outside.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Ballin'!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
but with considerably
less effort.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Ah. Racism.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm gonna talk to your mom.
She on MySpace.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Take 'em back
and go get my purple Speedo.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Everything!

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
TOBIAS:
Shut the fuck up!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Daddy said I can go
to the movies,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
It's a five-hour drive.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
And play it like you
got some sense.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'll call her.
Hee-hee-hee.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's no secret that black people

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
RILEY:
Purple Speedo?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
That's gay.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
No more of that damn
street ball hot-dogging

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Yeah, material things
can be replaced.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
So the only nigger
I gotta beat is Tobias?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
but he said I'm not allowed
to see  Soul Plane.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Are you a natural blond?
Oh. Oh, you are so funny.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
are culturally inclined against snitching.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Either she was gonna stay here,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
TOM: Yeah, you know what?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I think I might join you.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
TOBIAS:
Shut the fuck up, Percy!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
All right, boy,
so you had a bad dream.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
or I pay for her hotel room.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
hippity-hop, and one and seven,
whatever the hell it is.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
We don't have no place to go.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Good. You don't wanna go
to the movies with him.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
PERCY:
We don't like to see that.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
That makes us work harder.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, one more.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Hey, I ain't seen nothin'.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
It was a really bad dream
about--

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Shoot. Bad enough I gotta buy
all this damn champagne

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
Matter of fact, you about
to get a lesson in fundamentals.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
He's crazy.
Hush.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
RILEY:
I don't see the purple one.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Mm-hm. Nothing like the
open road. Seeing the country.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Please, we gotta get one more.
Look at that one.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Hell, nah!

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Did you check
the Speedo drawer?

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
and new sheets. I ain't Jay-Z.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Uh, damn, Tom,
are you sure you wanna come?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
COLONEL:
Well, shit fire

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
and save matches.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Can't see  Soul Plane?
Why, little baby?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Go outside and shoot
free throws while I change.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Man, fuck yo' mama!

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Go ahead, boy.
Bad dream and...?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
I mean,
you married.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Maybe I'll get to bed
early tonight.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Because of the types
of stereos or something.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's go get
some fresh air.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Shoot. I ain't ballin'
like a rock star.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Trees and lakes
and things.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Are you even allowed
to do it big?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Please, when you hit him,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Oh, man.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Ha! Oh, listen to this:

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It'd be good
for my vocals.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
But recently, what was once

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It was about
Stinkmeaner.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
And maybe a deer.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
it make us scared and make us
all just wanna stay here.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Types of stereos?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Sorry, man.
SARAH: I'm ticklish.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
an unwritten rule about snitching

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Leopard print's
all I could find.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
THUGNIFICENT:
To being on  Cribs.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
You know, it's, uh--
It's hardest on the kids.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
"Am I allowed"?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh. No, no, no,
little baby doll.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Any monkey can do them tricks.
You need to learn the basics.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
Sure, as long as I stay
within the agreed parameters.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
USHER:
I'm gonna

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
tickle you again.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
has become a full-blown "stop snitching" movement,

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Oh, man.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
The fulfillment
of a lifelong dream

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
We won't do nothings
if you keep hitting him

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Wouldn't let that shit
happen to me though.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Eww, why are your shorts
so short?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah, well, you know,
kids are strong.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
This is a good theater.
They have THX.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
of the last
six or seven years.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
'cause it's a-- An example
of what not to do.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
USHER:
You rollin' with Ush.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
complete with merchandising.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
RILEY: It was a big day for my homey

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Thugnificent,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
All right, let's go.
Game on.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You know, kids fight
wars in some countries.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Ha, ha.
Hey, I'm not dead, you know.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
COLONEL:
Well, since you love

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
these field niggers so much,

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Damn, these things are tight.
What about Stinkmeaner?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I don't think I can concentrate
on the game

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Take the murder of 19-year-old Jermaine "Lojack" Walker,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Alright, Thugnificent!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Nowhere for 'em
to call home.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
I still do the darn thing
from time to time.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
He was in hell, and he was
coming back to get us.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Well, sir.
Goodness.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
being on  Cribs  and all.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
because it looks like your thing
could fly out

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
I love to see my niggas on TV shinin',

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Well, home is where
the heart is.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
you can stay out here and work
with them for a few days.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
She means stereotypes.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And this is where I put
the rabbit ears behind his head.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
That's right, y'all.
Put your hands up, white folks!

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and brush up against me.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
You and me baby, doing it big.
It'll be great.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Stereotypes? In  Soul Plane?
That's nonsense.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
who was shot during a street-basketball tournament

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Stinkmeaner? Don't be crazy.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
'cause when they shine, I shine.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Yep. Yes, sir.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
That old man that Granddad
killed for no reason?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
Robert. Oh, my God.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I ain't changing my shorts.
TOM: Hey, guys.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Phew.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
And if I hear that song again,
I'm cuttin' both your balls off.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
in the middle of a summer afternoon

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
'Cause Thugnificent's
in the motherfucking...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
It's so good
to finally meet you.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Sort of.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Say, how about we tell
your daddy

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Ha-ha. See, honey?

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
No reason?
That man was a psycho.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Couldn't help notice you were
about to play some b-ball.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, well, you know,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, I guess so.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yes, yes,
I see the ears.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
in front of at least 300 eyewitnesses.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
we saw something else, hm?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
He almost killed
your granddaddy.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Man, I wanna go
over there,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Goddamn. Could somebody
tell me what time it is?

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
What you got there, Riley, huh?
You got some moves?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
my diabetes
been acting up again.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Nobody even called the cops. They all just went home.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Yeah. Uh-huh.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
All right! All right!
You can stay!

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Pictures?
Yes, I'll take a dozen 8-by-10.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
You guys are real
fuckin' assholes, you know that?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You mean...lie?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Don't you think
your behavior might have been

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
He was blind.
You killed a blind old man.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
but I don't wanna
dick ride, you know?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
What's wrong
with your watch?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Just like
the picture, right?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
What?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
HUEY: Despite news reports

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
to the contrary,

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
the slightest bit
inappropriate?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Colonel Stinkmeaner
was a menace.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Would that be dick riding?
You think? To go over there?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
My sweet Luna.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
Shit, nigga, the sun
is reflecting all this ice.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, Robert,
would you do that for us?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Yes. Jay-Z.
Yes. Cousin of mine.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That really doesn't seem to be
a good idea.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
But despite the cultural stigma against it,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I can't see
a motherfucking thing.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
my family was handling this particular

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Come on, man,
look on the bright side.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hush, boy.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, stop being insecure.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And I sent him to hell
where he belongs.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Come on in,
cutie pie.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Wow, that is pretty good
ball control.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Well, what a surprise.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
You get to hang out in the field
with the real niggas.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You know,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
a whopping one in 12 black men in poor neighborhoods

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
You look just like
your picture too.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Man,
get the fuck out of here.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Heh-heh. First cousin.
More Cristal?

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
racial incident quite well.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
it's okay to break
the rules

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
You were flirting.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
What it do, Woodcrest?
Ha-ha!

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
No, for real, nigga. Look.
Oh, shit. Damn, man.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Hey, toss me the ball, Riley.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
He asked me
to send him the pictures.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
is an active informant.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Yeah, Granddad,
real tough with the handicapped.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Except you're
wearing clothes.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
Come on, y'all,
he said it's cool.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Ain't you sick
of the white man?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
every once
in a while.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
What's 'hood in the Wood,
white folks?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Here you go.
Oh!

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
You are so exotic and beautiful.
Mm. Black sexual chocolate man.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Whoo!
I can't believe this.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
You know what I'm sick of?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I won't tell
if you won't.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Tom, you know
I'm a big Usher fan.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
You damn right, Mr. Policeman!
I saw the whole thing!

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Flo, you got your
stunna shades, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Yeah.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Oops, never mind.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
WOMAN:
Come on, y'all.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
You blaming the white man
for everything.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
He probably gonna beat up
some retarded kids next.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I just wanna say
we happy to be out here

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Shocking.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Oh, this is a pretty house.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
I always knew you'd
do something right.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay. Hee-hee.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So is Jazmine,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Put the motherfuckers on, nigga.
Tell me what time it is.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
The white man this,
the white man that.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
which make sense,
because she's 10.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
This retarded man
gonna whup your ass,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
in our new crib
in Woodcrest...

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
I have never seen anyone
his age with handles like that.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Much better than the last place.
Praise Jesus.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
HUEY:  Sometimes I think Granddad may be a bad influence.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Hey guys. I'm Luna.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
TOM:
Waiter, another Malibu

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
and pineapple, please.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
And you know
what's crazy?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
You'll never get anywhere
with that attitude.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What's that supposed to mean?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
HUEY: That means every party...

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
that's what he's gonna do.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
A'ight. What if I just
go over there

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Damn, nigga.
It's 2:30.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Robert, you remember
the family, don't you?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It means you're
a bit old to be acting

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
Wait-- You know what I meant!
What were we talking about?

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
and give him a pound and be
like, "What up, Thugnificent?"

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I hope you don't mind me
hanging out for the weekend.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
GRANDDAD: Oh, yes, you did.
RILEY: I didn't even mean to.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Man, fuck that white nigga.
That's your massa.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Hey, Riley. Don't forget
the camcorder.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
GRANDDAD:
I told him he needs to stop

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
street ball and learn to play.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
This is my mama, Jericha,
and my wife, Leona Ray.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Thank you.
Ha, ha, ha.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
like some screaming TRL  groupie.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I'll try and stay
out of your way, okay?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Hey. The doorbell girl
was wondering

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
What's wrong with you, boy?
Here come Huey McHater again.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
...every cookout...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Like, not really all on
his sac or nothing? Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
So then my dream
got really weird,

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
All I'm saying is,
you stop being a victim,

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Oh, yeah, your dream.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Come here. Let me show you
where to put your things.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
if you're expecting
and more company

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Yeah, but what natural talent.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, the first  Soul Plane
was funny.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Stop the car.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I'm here for everybody.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
because she can stay
if you want, but in 20 minutes,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Riley, you could
be a superstar one day.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Uh, our daughter Rolanda
and her four kids,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
'cause I was a mummy
in a Japanese girl pop band.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
you might better your life
on your own.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Look, boy,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
We don't keep cash
in the house.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Be happy. Your brother was
called a nigger by a white man.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Pfft. About as funny
as a lynching.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Now, now, we won't have
any of that. Just calm down.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
...every wedding...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Stinkmeaner ain't coming back.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Get back here, Riley.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
it's gonna be time and a half,
so...

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Shoot, I'm a superstar now.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
named Bobby, Robby and Ricky.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You ain't said nothing.
I'm gonna do that, believe it.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, hush, boy.
You ain't even see it.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
-Aw, come on, Granddad.
-Oh, no.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, Whitley, Mitley and Missy.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
I had a skirt on and everything.
Do you know what that means?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Stop the car!

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
probably has someone secretly working as an informant.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
He can't hurt you or me
or any of us, okay?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Time and a half?
Hell no.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Ever played on a team?

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Not just any white man.
A district employee.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
As soon as Catcher Freeman rides
through here with his brigade

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I never seen
a lynching, either,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I'll be right --

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
No.
Well, I'm coaching

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
And my son Nique
and his pregnant girlfriend,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
but I know
they not funny.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
THUGNIFICENT: My house is
your house. All is yours.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Uh, come on.
You want a drink?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Send that bitch home.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Where I live,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
A-- A soda?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
a Woodcrest Youth
Basketball Association team,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Diana Ross DuValle.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
I am so bored.
I wanna go home.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
and cuts that cracker's head
clean off, ugh, I'm out of here.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
See? Shows what you know.
I've seen funny lynchings.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
snitchin' is more like a recreational hobby.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
Now, let's get one more picture.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
That's a big
bitch.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Mm. Hope you got
air conditioning.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
I don't want either of you going
near that house. You hear me?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Mack, the hoes are
supposed to be here at noon.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
the Mighty Deers.
You know, Timid Deer Lane.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Ooh, this place is filthy.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
No, you haven't.
I have so.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
GRANDDAD:
A massage? A bath?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
What the fuck?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Don't nobody
clean up this house?

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Well, we wanna go have a nasty
threesome with Mr. Bitches,

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Oh, oh. Wow, we're rich!

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
You ain't never seen no nigga
be gone like I'm gonna be gone.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
They even have a club for snitches.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
A piece of chicken?
Anything.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.000
Man, Quinten just texted me.
He say the hoes is en route.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's like winning the lotto.
How?

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Roscoe Patterson's lynching
was funny.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
THUGNIFICENT:
I might buy everything.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
That's right, I rep the Deer.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I hope you don't have bugs,
because I can't stand bugs.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It's called the neighborhood watch.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Know what? Uh,
I don't wanna dick ride.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
but if you guys wanna
leave...

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Restitution.
Look at your brother.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
You ain't seen no nigga
ride out like me.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, so them
niggas was like,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
HUEY: Some people are scared

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
of zombies or vampires,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Quinten's hoes
is always en route.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Anyway,
season just got underway,

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Locusts and stuff.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Huh? No! No, please wait. No.
See you.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
So I'm gonna just, uh,
go back to the house.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
He's traumatized.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
And I'm a-join the gang.
I got a letter saying

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
"Roscoe, you better
leaves town

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
No snitchin'!

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
They ain't never  in here.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
but it's not too late
to try out for the team.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Shoot, I could have
stayed in Louisiana for this.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Hold it right there, boy!

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
but the thing that scare black people the most

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
LUNA:
Oh, you're

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
killing me.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
GRANDDAD:
Wait a minute!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Booty dance, booty dance

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
I can join
Catcher Freeman's brigade

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
"before Mr. Charlie
and them crackers

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Uh, are you mad?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
THUGNIFICENT:
...our new crib in Woodcrest,

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Damn. We might as well
be working at Kinko's.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Y'all any good?
Um, no.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
and ride out

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Woodcrest

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
gonna come for you."

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
with all these trees
and white bitches and lemonade

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
Oh. That Larry David
is something else. Whoo!

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Hey, Thugnificent,
I'm taking off.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
HUEY:
Granddad, Riley's doing

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
the celebratory booty dance.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Now, where was you at 11:00
last night, huh? Huh?!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
But we have a lot of spirit.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
MAN:
Damn, you get mail, nigga?

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm like, "Man,
fuck them crackers, man.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Tom DuBois was as far from a nigga

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
and bagels and shit.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Just wanted to say thanks for
the opportunity. It was great.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
He's traumatized on the inside.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Ha! Ha-ha! That's your plan?
Catcher Freeman, huh?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
So...

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Cool. More shine for me.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Nana. Nana.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This is Roscoe Patterson."
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
RILEY:
Usher?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Come on, now!
Don't lie to me, nigga!

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
But you know how we do.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
you never told me
what kind of dogs you have.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You both say "nigga"
all the time.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Nigga, I was in bed.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
as a black man could be.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
We bring the 'hood with us,
right here.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Hey, little mama, why don't
you stay and kick it with

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
us for a little bit?

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Hey, great shorts.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Why not just wait
for Santa Claus

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I just don't
give a fuck.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I have one Dalmatian,
two retrievers.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
KID:
I'm going to get you.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I do not.
Riley thought it was his name

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That nigga's my age.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
No, you wasn't.
I seen you with my own eye.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
But Stinkmeaner knew that every black man's spirit

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Now let's make it rain.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You sure you gotta leave?

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
Oh, man. Y'all up here doing
it real big and shit, huh.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
until he was 3.
That's different.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
to take you away
on his sled?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Know what I'm saying?
White man can eat a dick.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Sorry. My boyfriend's here.
He wanted to meet you so bad,

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So you guys don't think
I'm overreacting?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
You was robbing white people's
houses, wasn't you?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
GIRL:
Yeah. This is fantastic.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Mm-hm. That's nice.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
See, it's okay between us
behind closed doors.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
You don't believe
in Catcher Freeman?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Eat my balls,
nigga.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
is weakened during a nigga moment.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Ha-ha. Whoo.
That's right, nigga.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Oh, and 15 wolves.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Told you so!

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't think so.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
but he's gotta get back to work
at Kinko's, so bye.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
We have flipped the word
into a term of endearment.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Of course I don't.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
MAN: There he is!
Get that nigger.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And--
Oh, look at them wheels!

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
BOTH:
Wolves?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, I see y'all niggas,
y'all living, huh.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I don't believe
in the Easter Bunny either.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
You're a bigtime lawyer,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
What the--?!

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
I'm about to do it big
in Woodcrest, nigga.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Uh-oh.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and Sarah's acting all crazy
over an usher?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
The law say
when the bicycle stop,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Right across the street,
I'm gonna put a club.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
You mean, like, wolf wolves?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Hey, did you want the water
slide to keep going?

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
TOM:
So, what do you say?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
That's what I call my homeys.
You feel me? My nigga.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
I'm telling you, man.
Catcher Freeman is real.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, come on, you n--
Nincompoop.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah, y'all got some
real nice stuff up in here.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Should I call my travel agent
or what, huh?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Come on,
let's go!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Not an usher. Usher.
He's a singer.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
the wheels
supposed to stop.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Uh, next door is gonna be
my detail shop.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Yeah. For some reason,
wolves really like me.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Because it is getting expensive.
I mean, it's your money.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Okay, um, Frank.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
He go round from plantation
to plantation,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
MAN: Oh, shoot, he's fast!
Watch out!

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
You need a special permit
for wheels like that.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
Uh... Yeah.
Let me, uh, check my schedule.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
You can't do that!
Hey, come on.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Nigga, I'm about to clear
all this shit out. Ha-ha!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
I was raised
around wolves.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Go one-on-one
against Riley.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Wait. Oh, what's that,
the PSP right there? Man.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It, uh, wasn't really
funny after that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Ushers ain't supposed
to sing.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
I'm all, like, it's --
whatever.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
No, no, give me
the whole starting five.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
freeing all the slaves
and shit.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You can't hear
the movie.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Oh, come back here!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
They get a bad rap,
but really,

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
No.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
He, like, 14 feet tall,

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Mm-mm.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Nigga moments can happen to any black man at any time.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
GIRL:
Welcome to

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
the neighborhood.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
if you aren't afraid
to establish dominance,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
You got more shit
than a nigga need in here.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
HUEY: In the past, Granddad has had

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
complications with babysitters.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Hey! After a lifetime of
being treated like a nigger,

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I finished cleaning
the storm drain for you, Robert.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm calling the police.
Stop!

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
No, cut it off.
Shut it off!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yep, yep. All of 'em.
Let's go.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Huh? That's right, y'all.
Thugnificent bringing the 'hood

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
there's nothing
wrong with wolves.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
Damn. I bet these vases

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
if I catch a break off
the word, good for me.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
got trapezius muscles
and biceps. Shit crazy.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This  is going to be...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh. What's wrong?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
That's, uh...

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
OLD MAN:
Can we bring in the Army?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Hey, I-- That was my space.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
TOM:
All right, Deers.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
cost y'all
an arm and a leg, huh?

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
All the years
I've been on this Earth,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
...the worst day
of your life.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Tom's wife is cheating on him
with a singing usher.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
How long will we wait
on the police to protect us?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
to this very street.
Heh-heh.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Get out there
and give him what you got.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
He ain't just no normal nigga,
he's supernigga.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I had my blinker on
and everything.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
The ghetto is here,
y'all. Heh.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Uh, fascinating.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Oh, my God. What should we do?
Games, hula-hooping, Hot Wheels?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
know how many times
I been called a nigger for free?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, I didn't say
she was cheating.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Uh, so, um...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
My ass!

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, I see y'all.
Y'all like me, though:

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
He like a black-ass Batman,
if you will.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Fuck you, punk-ass,
bougie-ass, hook-ass nigga!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Ain't this a bitch?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
how long you been
kickboxing?

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I know. We should make s'mores.
Tell stories? Hide-and-go-seek?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Back in the day, when a white
man called you a nigger,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm bringing nunchucks.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Lord, Lord, Lord.
How did you end up

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Can we bring in
the Army?!

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Well, I do a lot of
martial arts.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
Hey! Who turned off
the motherfucking water?!

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I like having things too,
you hear me?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
He can fly...
underwater.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'll beat
your motherfucking ass, nigga!

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Who in the hell
left the gate open?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I got to have it, you dig?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
you couldn't
do nothing but go cry.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
RILEY: Heh-heh-heh.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Huh?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
with that white woman
anyway?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
This is a tragedy.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
...'cause I love it. Heh.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Not exactly kickboxing,
but it's kind of similar.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Can we play cops-and-robbers?
I wouldn't.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
The white man ain't never
done nothin' to nobody,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Don't never in your life
ever try to holler at me.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
I'm a do-what-it-takes
kind of nigga, man.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
But now we can fight back.
As a matter of fact...

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Wait, how they know who Batman is?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I say toss her groupie ass
out the window

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
What up, old nigga?!

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
GRANDDAD: Stop interrupting!

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Fuck with me, nigga,
and I'll be popping a trunk

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
It's called White Lotus kung fu.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I get it how I live, and
live how I get it, you feel me?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
Cops-and-robbers?
Sounds like fun.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and let that ho stargaze
from outside.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Ha! That's ridiculous.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
and he don't deserve this.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
on your bitch ass, nigga.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
You got some words
of welcome

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't even know
who Batman is.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Now, Riley,
there's never a place

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
TOM: Wait, everyone.
Please, order.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Get my motherfucking Uzi.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
for all this
Thugnificence?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
White Lotus?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
That's what real niggas do.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Hello? Tom. Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
And what's your plan,
house nigga?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
That's the deadliest
style there is.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Bitch, this all you got?

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
for violence
in a relationship.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Come on over here.
Do it big, man.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Hey, guys.
What I got to do

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Three dollars
and a prepaid cell phone

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Riley's teacher
called him a nigger.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I bet you don't even wanna
escape, all on Massa's nuts.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
People, calm down.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah, and it's great
exercise.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
There sure seemed to be a place
at the restaurant last night.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
This is our fault.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Thug out with the homey.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
to become a member
of the Lethal Interjection crew?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Granddad, I can't believe
you let them niggas stay here.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
with fucking two minutes on it?

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We gonna sue the white man.
Get over here quick.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
You never
mentioned, uh,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, I'm gonna escape all right.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
We've let the predators
think we're weak.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
What did you say, nigga?!

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Mm-mm.
Nappy-headed hos.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
that you were
a kung fu master.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Man, you wanna
be down with us?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Hear what happened
to the last black man

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
I'm gonna escape with this,
okay? With my mind.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Here, put these coats on.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
You're talking about
joining a family.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
That's messed up, Riley.
That's family.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
HUEY: That landed us

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
on DontSitEm.com.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
She made you look like a bitch
in front of Usher.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
Has the Department
of Homeland security

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
You know what, motherfucker?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
This crazy ex-boyfriend
I had one time,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
who was called
a nigger? Huh?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Huh?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
This crew is made up
of niggas

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Family? I ain't never seen
them niggas before in my life.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
No teenager in the world would babysit us now.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Last year,
Terrence Kinsley,

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I've got this. It's a play,
but for the screen.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Boy, watch
your mouth.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Eat a dick, nigga.
I'm tired of this mo--

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
he was a Shaolin monk.
I learned it from him.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
I've known my whole life,
shorty.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Probably
started out charitable.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
ruled out terrorism?!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, yeah? Well, fuck you,
old-ass nigga!

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
a 35-year-old Wal-Mart employee,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Except for Flonominal
and Macktastic,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Far as I'm concerned,
them niggas is the homeless.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Granddad was forced to hire

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
was called a nigger by a supervisor.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
GRANDDAD:
Here you go.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
She took you in, was probably
teachin' you how to read.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It was them Freeman boys.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Stop hating and get money,
my nigga.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Then I ended up
having to use it on him,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What is it?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
if you know what I mean.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
who I met through the label
last year,

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
They were left to drown.
Yeah, that's real messed up.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
one of those no-nonsense British super nannies.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
What screen, nigga?
We in the 1800's.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's pinto beans
and neck bones.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm telling you, you can't
trust them new niggas.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
You just mad at
all this Thugnificence.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But, Granddad, she did make
Mr. DuBois look like a bitch.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Oh, yeah, look at ya.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
but we're like brothers,
though.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Now put this meat loaf
and gravy under your shirt.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
Poor them. Why don't they
take their homeless asses home?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
I thought of a way to display
moving pictures on a screen.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Yeah, I said it.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
You was popping all that
good shit a second ago.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Respect it, man!

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Lethal Interjections is about
rags to bitches, nigga.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Why don't we just get treats
from the concession stand?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah. We know she made Tom
look like a bitch,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
-Now, Ruckus, that's crazy.
-If they're so innocent,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
HUEY: So somebody calls you

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
a nigger,

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Of course, it's all abstract,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
breathe it in, nigga.
Bask in it.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
Well, Huey is very interested
in martial arts,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
HUEY:
They have nothing to go home to.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
but find a different way
to say it.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Then you got kicked
in your chest.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Man, I'm about
rags to bitches, too.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
RILEY:
We let them niggas stay here,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Which actually worked out,

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
since I don't have any actual
film or cameras or anything,

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Next thing you know,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
why won't they talk
to the police?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
except Granddad set up a nanny cam.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
you get a mansion, a yacht
and white women?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
you rubbin' against
that silky white skin. Oh.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
You eat a dick, nigga,
you eat a dick!

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
we won't have
nothing to go home to.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Yep, it's the law.
No, it's not.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
but I'm gonna show Massa Colonel
my screenplay,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You think I'm paying $20
for some popcorn?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
-What did he say?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Now, where were we?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
and, uh, I do a little
Tae Bo myself.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
It's about getting paper,
my nigga.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
RUCKUS: Yeah.
Why wouldn't they?

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Now, you know I'm all about
getting my paper.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Everybody knows
New Orleans niggas are grimy.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
It is too. It happened
to the Wal-Mart guy.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
and when he reads it,
he's gonna know

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
But I don't know
the non-curse way

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Uh, I don't know. I -- I think it's pretty cool, I guess,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
GRANDDAD: This is when

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
you used my telephone.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You must be out
of your damn mind.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Doesn't sound like
innocent behavior to me.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Have you heard of the Kumite?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
Pfft. You probably
made that up.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
this could be
a huge production.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
to say he got bitched.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Come on, man, you gots
to let me in the crew.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Yep. Thanks, wardy.
That's my hat.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Who the hell you got to talk to?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Humiliated,
castrated, emasc--

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Why wouldn't they
wanna talk to the police?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh-- Oh, my God.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
having a big celebrity move in.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Did you say Kumite?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
You left the lights on in the kitchen.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
I bet you Tom would know.
Where is he?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Are we allowed
to bring in food?

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Sir, are you okay?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Now, Riley,
I want you to know

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Both of you shut up.
They'll stay.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Nigga, you trying to get off
the plantation

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Of course we're allowed to.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, all right, all right.
I get the point.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Well, I don't really know much about him,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Uh-huh. The Kumite.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
that even though
we doin' it real grand,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
I don't see nobody there.
Do you?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Don't take that long
to get over here.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
I  love  talking
to the police.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
Who did this to you?
What--? What did he look like?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.000
but my two teenage kids are very excited.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Good for you, Granddad.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Sitting up here,
watching television,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Tom, hurry up. I'm trying
to sue the white man.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
by selling a script? Ha!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's my food, isn't it?
I paid for it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I mean, I can see
if it was a real nigga.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We're gonna go check 'em out.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
What's a Kumite?

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
if this rap shit don't work,
we running up in nigga's houses.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
We can't even imagine
what they've lost.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
Nigga, you ain't even supposed
to know how to read.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
That's all you get for free.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
all the lights on.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
I need a lawyer, but I don't
wanna pay, so you'll have to do.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That means I can eat it
when and where I want.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
If the cops won't make 'em talk,
I'll make 'em talk.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Did-- Did anyone see
who accosted this man?

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
You know, they love him.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
It's a mythical, invitation-only
martial arts tournament

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Please. I've seen that raggedy
piece-of-shit house.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
Using up all of my electricity,
eating a sandwich.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
If you lost
your ho to T.I.,

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
That's all I need to see.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
How you gonna sell
a script, asshole?

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I'd be like,
"Hey, that's T.I."

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
They have the CD diskettes and the video games

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
You know what I mean?
For real. Better believe that.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
That nigga ain't
lost that damn much.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
What I don't understand is

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Boy, put this pot roast in
your pants or you ain't eating.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Mrs. von Hausen,
the neighborhood watch

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
I got a date?
I can't believe it.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
with the deadliest
fighters in the world.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
Riley, I started this team
because when I was younger,

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I'd like a sandwich myself.
All my bologna is gone.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Plus, there's
a writer's strike.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
that if it's
so offensive to them,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, this is nothing.
He's just getting started.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But Usher?

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
and the dungarees with his name on the, um, pocket.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So you like Jean-Claude
Van Damme. Damn.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
We're gonna be hittin'
the streets, son,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
Bob, I'm in Woodcrest,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
What's wrong with you,
woman?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh, yeah? Me and Thelma
are gonna marry,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
is not
a law-enforcement agency.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Of course you got
a date, Granddad.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
moving mad rock all day,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
I saw a movie
called  The Mighty Ducks,

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
then why do they say it
over and over again?

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
have kids
and live in Massa's house.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
You better check that ho,
Mr. DuBois.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Everything on your page
is a lie.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
the very small community
with a very big heart.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
HUEY: After that, Granddad had

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
to be more creative.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You know what?
You guys are right.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
I don't want them damn niggas

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
But I didn't think
the Kumite really existed.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
selling that real heavy
drug shit.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
and there was that moment at the end,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
No interrogations!

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
No, it is not.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
living across the street from me. Shoot.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
Robert Freeman,
a local resident here,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
MAN:
So Riley said the N-word

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
before you did that morning?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
HUEY: Robert Jebediah Freeman

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm gonna go back there
and put her in check.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Granddad, you don't skydive,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, no. The Kumite is real.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
MAN: Know what I mean?
All day, son.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
just the coach believing in his players,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Excuse me, uh, my name
is Positive Brother Hakeem

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
had sworn a lifetime intifada

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Now, if you visit
the Freemans

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Paid too much money for my house. Funny-ass music.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
He says it every morning.
He calls me "nigga."

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and ask them to join
the neighborhood watch,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
you're not Brazilian,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
It's really real.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Or we be flipping them burgers
at Wendy's, my nigga.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
and they won.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
has decided
to open his home

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Tell me what you think
about your ass, nigga.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
against the movie theater industry

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
For example,
how many white women

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
It was like a miracle moment.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
to Katrinian refugees.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
from Positive Big Black Brothers
and Sisters of America.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
for exorbitant prices and poor customer service,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
that would be great.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
and you never was
a member of G-Unit.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Why is the news here?
Well, I called the news

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
He calls
the other kids "nigga."

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
GRANDDAD: Thelma was

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
your great-great-great-

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
want to go to a basketball game
just to see the game,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
You know what I mean? With fries
and shit. I'll do whatever.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
And ever since then,
I wanted to live that moment.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
And let's all of us reach out
to all our other neighbors

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Mind your damn business.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
and told them
what you did for us.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And I understand you have
two misguided young brothers

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
He calls himself "nigga"
all the time.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
great-great-great-grandmother.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
which, interestingly enough,

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
And she probably a man.
Shut up.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Get 'em outta here.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
LUNA: The Kumite is usually held

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
come back with one of them
NBA niggas out of sympathy?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Shakes, all that.
Extra ketchup.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
Help misfit kids realize their
dreams through youth sports.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
What the hell you do that for?
Don't be modest. It's okay.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
who need some positivity.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
"Nigga this, nigga that.
Nigga, please.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Now, Tobias was madly in love with young Thelma.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
did not stop him from going to see movies.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
to help us keep an eye out.
Okay?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
on some faraway mysterious island.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
MAN: Thugnificent and his cohorts,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Macktastic and Flonominal,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
"You need some napkins?"
You feel me?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
"Bitch-nigga.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
Eww...

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, gang.
Keep your eyes open.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
She came to
see the game.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
MAN:
So, Mrs. Wong,

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
So it's a nice getaway.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
It's not okay. Now every damn
Katrina victim for 100 miles

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Yep, bedtime's at 9.
Have fun.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
"Nigga, have you lost
your mind?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
She wanted to be
entertained.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
MAN:
Well, that's sensible.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
But Thelma didn't want his old Uncle Tom ass.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Open for what?

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
there you were not carjacking Mr. Teskinelli,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
formed the Lethal Interjection Crew

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
But it all backfired.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Local calls only on my phone,
thank you.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
"Nigga, check that ho.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We're sneaking in.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
MAN 2: The black one's right.
Really, he is.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What the fuck is you talking-- ?
What the fuck was that?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
gonna be coming here. Hello.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, the white woman's
got a big heart.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
and tasted success early with the smash club anthem

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
They were terrible.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Nigga, you bullshitting.
Break yourself, nigga."

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Besides, she was about to meet Catcher for the first time.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's not true,
little baby.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, we're gonna
reach out, all right.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Kind of like one of them

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm sorry, man.
THUGNIFICENT: Shut the fuck up.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Mr. Freeman,
what makes a man

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
beating him senseless with a nine iron,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
We never won a single game.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I bought my tickets online.
Scout's honor.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Lord, she's got a big heart.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
"Booty-Butt Cheeks."

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
all-inclusive vacation packages.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I wasn't thinking
about it when I did it.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
open his home
to complete strangers?

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
He says it so much,
I don't even notice it anymore.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
Young Thelma yearned for her freedom,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
stealing his wallet and driving his car

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Just one agonizing loss after another.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Oh, no. These are not complete
strangers. This is family.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Look. Granddad.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Now Thugnificent has a new

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
They cover room and food. Everything.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
I-- I should've said,
like, Burger King.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
Last week in lunch,
Riley says to a classmate:

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I got some money saved.
The movie will be on me.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
into the hosiery section of the JCPenney?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
We ended our season last year

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
so one night she decided to make a run for it.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
multimillion-dollar major-label deal,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Ah, yes, the human family.
Oh, no, no, no.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
Correct.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Except for incidentals, of course.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
with the worst record in the league.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
"Can a nigga borrow
a French fry?"

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, you put that away,
boy.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
a new house in the suburbs,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Let's just go
to the initiation.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
This is my actual family.
This is my second cousin.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
Oh, but that poor, little, sweet girl didn't get far.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
These movie devils
ain't getting

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
I have no further
questions.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and a new album, "Rags to Bitches."

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
It's nice, you know?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
The first test
is the agreeability test.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
It was the saddest thing you've ever seen.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
And my first thought wasn't,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
any more of our money.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
What the hell do y'all want?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
You get to catch up with old friends,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
"Oh, my God, he said the word."
Uh, "The N-word."

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Before you are a member
of the team,

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Because we're all cousins
and brothers and sisters

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
She ain't going nowhere.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Mm-mm.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We'll ask the questions
around here, Robert.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Now, Mrs. Wong,
let me ask you a question.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
You see, "Rags to Bitches" is more than a album.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
see some really good matches, get a tan.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
But I think
that just changed.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
We ain't gonna hurt you
too much.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Uh...Mr. Freeman?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
we have to make sure you share

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
in the eyes of God?
Well, not exactly. See--

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
It was, "Now, how is a nigga
gonna borrow a fry?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Ask the question,
Miss von Hausen.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
You know what I'm sayin'? I consider it as a movement.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Good times.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
my Thugnificent
taste and sensibilities.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
We can win, Riley.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
MAN:
I might hurt you.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
I might hurt you.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
The way I'm looking at it, I'm picking up where

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
You and I can share
that miracle moment together.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
What do you hope to get
out of helping these people?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It says, "No outside food,"
little girl.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
I don't have time
for this crap!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Good times.
The Kumite is supposed to be

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Nigga, is you gonna
give it back?"

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Hey, look up in the tree. It's a bird.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Is your granddad home?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Get out the way,
old white woman.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
What's good, nigga?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Malcolm X left off, nigga. It's that big.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
HUEY:
Costa Rica for two weeks?

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Nope, it's Catcher Freeman. Yippee! Come on.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's why we keep it
inside our clothes.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
How are we supposed
to survive for two weeks?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
VON HAUSEN:
Mr. Freeman,

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Ahhh!

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
a death match, right?
You ever killed anybody?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
If, and only if,
we believe in each other.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Not a damn thing.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm telling you, my inside voice
didn't talk like that

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Are you sure
this is legal?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
we are from the Woodcrest
neighborhood watch.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
This is the movement that says, you know --

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Man,
what we gonna eat?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad.
Mr. DuBois' at the door.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Oh, my God.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Hey. Everybody has to
die sometime. Hm.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I believe in you.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Wow. So selfless. Bob.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Oh, now you worried
about how you're gonna

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
Now, as you know, we've had
some home invasions recently.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Excuse me,
Mr. DuBois?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
"Don't grow up and act like a fucking fool all the time,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
before he got in my class.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Get him, get him. Watch it.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay, everybody, look alive now.
Here's our chance.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
What do you say?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
You's a bitch.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Ho-ho, shit, nigga.
That motherfucker's banging.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Call my agent, man.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
make it
without your Granddaddy.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
He said I said it first?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
Watch behind you, Catcher. Watch behind you. There you go.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
-Mm-hm.
-We were concerned to hear

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Ahem. Well, I-I said, um...

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
and you can still make it up out the 'hood

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Y'all should of thought about
that when y'all fucking up.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
and enjoy everything that life has to offer."

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
You hear that bass line?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Man, I'm telling you,

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I understand
you need your job,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, Tom, I'm sorry
to hear about the split.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
that you refused
to talk to the police.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh-ho. Gotta hurt.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Yo, it's blazing, son.
That shit is incredible, kid.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
You bet I will, buddy.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I seen the hatred
in his eyes

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
RILEY: Man, hold up, hold up.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
but you're still
a human being with dignity.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
What's really good?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
It's too late now.
I may never come back.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I would love to
let you crash,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
-I didn't see nothin'!
-You tell 'em, granddad.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Finish him.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
KID:
Mama, Cousin Granddad kicked me.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
the first time
I walked in the class.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
This nigga jumping out of trees?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
KIDS:
Throw it to me, throw that ball.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Shoot, it's Tom.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Catcher Freeman was a master swordsman.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, I mean,
look at this uniform, man.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
but I just don't know
where you would stay.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
No snitchin'.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
I mean, it's hot-hot,
but you know me.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
All he saw when he looked at me
was a black nigger.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I look like
a fucking dork.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
JUDGE:
Is there something really good

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Hey, we hear you was
helping people from New Orleans.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Y'all can't tell him I left.
Why not?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
How this nigga learn all that ninja stuff?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why would they make me dress
like this?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Maybe the guest room.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
You've also refused
our previous invitations

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
you'd like to share
with the court, Mr. DuBois?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
I would just turn up the bass a
little higher in the monitor --

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Riley, you're an hour
late to practice.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
We used to live right close to--

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
He wanna go to that
"do it big" trip too,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
They didn't even have karate flicks back then.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What did I do
to them, huh?

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Ooh. Ooh.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, I had
a girlfriend in Katrina.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
TOM:
I don't know if you have

06:53.000 --> 06:56.000
much of a case, Robert.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You should take action.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Who told him about
the guest room?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
to join
the neighborhood watch,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Fuck you,
hating-ass nigga.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
I didn't come to practice.
You never called my agent.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
but I can't roll
with a square like Tom,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Hush, boy! It was love at first sight.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and we could use
your support.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Fuck your court, nigga!

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Nobody give a fuck
what your dumb ass think.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
And I'm hungry--
No.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
so I'm gonna go
and pretend I didn't go,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Ah. What can  I  do?

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
MASTER:
Luna wins.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
I thought that was a joke.
Oh, no, no.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Goddamn it, Jericho.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
The guy just seems
kind of...dumb.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
Our motto is:
Neighbors watching neighbors.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Mr. DuBois!
Fuck your court, nigga!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Give me this motherfucker.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
and take that lie
with me to the grave.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
He was tall, he was handsome,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Thank you so much,
Robert.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Young Reezy never joke
about his paper stacks.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I told you this
was going to happen.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
And he's already apologized.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
his trapezius muscles rippled through his shirt.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Get your ass up out of here,
you hook-ass nigga.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
Heh-heh.
Price of fame.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
So don't tell him.
Say I went to the store.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
See, boys? See why

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
Damn it, I wanna get paid.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
All right, Granddad, dang. You making me uncomfortable.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Have you ever thought about
forming a union?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I tell you marriage is bad?

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Fuck your court!

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I mean, I'm like,
"You kill one man,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
MAN #1: Tired of this.
MAN #2:

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Punk-ass, pussy-ass nigga.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Robert Freeman.
You know him, right?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
You went to the store
for two weeks?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I'm gonna call
a press conference.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, I'm watchin', all right.
I'm watchin' this neighborhood

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Give him a call.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What's a "union"?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't care
what nobody say.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
RUCKUS: It's like somebody threw
a million dollars

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
you kill a dozen."
It's all the same.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I ask you to bless him, Lord,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yes, and don't
you go snitching.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
About what?
I don't know,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Catcher Freeman was a sexy man!

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Get the fuck up out of here
with that bullshit.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Y'all can take care
of everything.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
Well, it's harder to talk
if my mouth is full.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
but I'm calling one.
Mm-mm.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I ain't never
gettin' married.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
become a bunch
of damn tattletales.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
into the monkey cage at the zoo.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I mean, they can only
hang you once, right?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Anyway, I came to talk to you
about the uniforms.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
and keep providing for him,
Lord,

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And old Thelma was smitten. Hee!

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I paid.
I got my ticket.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
Lady Liberty's got balls!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
MAN #1: Beat it.
MAN #2: Nigga.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
You got the wrong man.
That's what you did. Heh.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Good one, granddad.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
It breaks my heart
to watch

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
I got mine today
and that joint is wack.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
so that he may
keep providing for us, Lord.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
All right, fine.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, yeah. I got
a ticket for you.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Oh, am I right or am I right?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I left food money
in the cabinet above the oven.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Hi, I'm Thelma.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You killin' 'em.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
the "negridation"
of this decent place.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
Anyway, Riley,
what do you think?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
You messed with
the wrong brother.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
A one-way ticket
to "Get the hell

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Statistically speakin',
it was bound to fail anyway.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Property was stolen,
Mr. Freeman.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Oh, no.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Well, we can't live
next to their kind.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Oh, we gotta talk about
the team name too.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Jesus, amen.
As we walk in your glory.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
That's all you gonna get.
So make it last.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
My name's Catcher.
Catcher Freeman.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
out of here, negro"
land.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.000
Uh, I think
it sounds really good.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
What's the number
to a press conference?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Go on! Move it!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
RUCKUS: Stolen.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Come on, now, you're
leaving me hanging.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
You don't like the name?
We rep Timid Deer.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Hey there, Robert,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
You're Catcher Freeman? The  Catcher Freeman?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
The sanctity of our
community was violated.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
We have kids.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Get off of me, woman.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
I'd offer to help you,
but you're a coon.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I ain't gonna
stand for it.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Are you sure you like it?
'Cause if you wanna be down

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
ALL:
We gotta go to the bathroom.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
I don't wanna rep Timid Deer.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
What's he doing here?
He's your sitter.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
You've heard of me?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Tough titty.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
What's good, nigga?!

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
We were here first.
Right.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
I wanna rep something
that don't sound faggy.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
No, I don't think we should use the word,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Of course I've heard of you.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I ain't got time
for this bullshit.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
GRANDDAD:
What we gonna do?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Oh...

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
with the Lethal Interjection
crew,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Granddad, me and Riley
don't need no babysitter.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
TOM: Well, I'd sell my house
if I thought

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
you got to  really  think
it sounds good.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm not feeling the name.
Nope.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
and I'll tell you why.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Who has not heard
of Catcher Freeman?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Nigga, you gay.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Boy, I'll be back tonight.
Move the hell out of my way.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
it was still
worth anything.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Move it, move it,
hurry. Get on.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Because niggas have gotten used to it, that's why.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
How about that?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Hurry up.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
I don't care how good you are,
I'm not changing the name.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
We can take care
of ourselves.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Where are you escaping from?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
See it's burnin' me
to hold onto this.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Robert, did you just
touch a white woman?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Why don't you just
invite them over for dinner

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Thanks for
inviting a killer

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Yeah, not like we gonna
try to kill each other.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Oh, Colonel Lynchwater's.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Another victory
of the common man

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
I do.
How good?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Hell, they like it now.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
HUEY: Meanwhile, I couldn't

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
shake the feeling

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
and get to know
one another?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
kung-fu wolf bitch
to the crib.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
Suit yourself.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
Shut up. Do what Ruckus says
and don't mess up my house.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's like when you growing crops

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
I've been there for a while
and I kind of feel

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
over corporate greed.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Yeah.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Uh, real good?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
I just feel sorry for them.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
like I got everything I can get
out of that organization.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You're not advancing
any struggle

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I know this is something
I gotta do.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
RUCKUS: Sorry he touched you,
Miss von Hausen.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You think I knew she was
a killer kung-fu wolf bitch?

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
They ain't never gonna get

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and you strip the soil of its nutrients,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
that an evil force was gathering.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
I guess I could do that.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
by being cheap,
Granddad.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
We'll make sure
you get sterilized.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
She ain't say nothing
about no damn

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
He don't even like black people.
Man, this punk fool right here.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
and then you can't grow nothing.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
I can read and write,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
MACKTASTIC:
What's happening, nigga?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
Okay, you passed.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
that dream you promised them
and for what?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
Whoo-ee.
Boy, I hope you got some spray.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
so hopefully that'll
look good on my résumé.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'll advance my belt
on your behind

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Kupate, Kumatoo, Kumite,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Next is a test of courage.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
You gotta rotate your racial slur.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
if you don't shut
your ass.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Whoa, whoa! Look out!

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Where the chicken wings
and the doughnuts at?

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
coon, black coon.
Now, just hush.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
One man's ego?
Sad. Good luck.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Okay, first of all,
ain't nobody talking

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, my God.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Sarah--

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
You almost touched
Miss von Hausen!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
I must be crazy.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
It smell like the circus
in town up in there.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
while I'm talking,
so shut the fuck up.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Now, I know it's hard

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
My brigade is nearby.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
What the fuck you got to eat
in this bitch, nigga?!

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
'cause "nigga" just rolled off the tongue

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I didn't pay
to get in the movie.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Stop snitchin'!

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
MAN: Nah, you ain't crazy.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I'm trying to figure out
what we're gonna do.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
ALL:
Bye, Riley.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
We're ready to kill
Colonel Lynchwater

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I love you

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
You-- You gonna
need a gas mask

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
My name is Uncle Ruckus,
and I will be nigger-sitting

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
the way sweat rolls off a nigga's forehead.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
and free all your friends
and kinfolk.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Uh, yes, we did. I --
I ordered my tickets online.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Stinkmeaner's coming back.
But Stinkmeaner died.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Huey, what are we gonna do?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
and galoshes
to go in there.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's just, I feel like this

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Bye, Riley.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
A HAZMAT suit.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Who got the neck bones?

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Mm-mm. That shit
ain't happening.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
You gonna tell her
to get out.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
HUEY: Tom relented and negotiated

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
you two until your
grandfather returns.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
But we cannot let that be a crutch.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
But we'll need your help.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
No, you didn't.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
What you gonna tell me, ghosts don't exist?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm not telling her
to leave.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Maybe something crawled
up my ass and died, man.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Great, that's a relief,
'cause all my friends

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
is coming to an end.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
a half-season contract with Riley.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
Especially when there are so many other fine substitutes:

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
We snuck in.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Then what the fuck do I look like?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
She hit me with one of them
exploding nutsack techniques.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
In lieu of monetary compensation,

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Your granddaddy picked me

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Ghostface Killah
isn't even dead.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Damn. These niggas
don't do nothing

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
because
I am a licensed zoologist.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
about to be talking bad
about me.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We stole a movie.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Oh, come on, Granddad.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Tom agreed to allow Riley to design the uniforms

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
spade, porch monkey, jiggaboo.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
Like, "Thelma done changed
since she been free.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Now, who makes the rules?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Now, you say what you want,

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
She's not a kung fu
master. She's crazy.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
but watch TV and eat.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
I have studied
a variety of wild animals,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
that goofy-looking motherfucker is coming back.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
and pick the name of the team.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Man, stop complaining.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I say next time you gonna call a darky a nigga,

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
She forgot where she came from,
she don't never come around."

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Grownups, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Hey, boy.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Shit.
Then you go kick her ass out.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
They're not gonna
be here forever.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
Your granddad's nigga moment ain't dead yet.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
ANNOUNCER:
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
and the African male is by far
the most savagely cunning.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I'm grown up,
and I say it's okay.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Y'all might as well stop
making that Kool-Aid right now,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
call that coon a jungle bunny instead.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
You know. Ah, Catcher was smitten too.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
But what am I
supposed to do?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
But this is your responsibility.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Go to bed soon.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
Hey. I'm willing to stay
in the bathroom all night.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
the Ball-a-Holics!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
'cause I don't
even drink grape.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Good night, Granddad.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
If death can't stop Stinkmeaner,
what can?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
TOM:
So in conclusion,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
That night, Thelma told the other slaves

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I should call my daddy
and turn myself in.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I only drink cherry
and strawberry.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
This is an opportunity
to observe you niggers

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
Think about it. Peace.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Where you going?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, yeah.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Young Reezy Riley Freeman.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
we don't wanna try
this case in the press. No.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
about the plan to escape with Catcher.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, yeah?
You gonna tell him

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
To say this

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
You two just...stay here.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
ALL: Yeah.
Oh, hey, shorty.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
When y'all going
to the store too?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
in your natural habitat
and collect data.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
-Shh-shh-Shh.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
I don't eat that shit
y'all got up in here.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Let me get this straight.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
what you came to see,  huh?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
From my heart

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
And let's remember that
the victim is a young child.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Catcher gonna come
through here with his brigade,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay. I gotta use
the bathroom anyway.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You got it, nigga.
Get on and do that thing.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
That's my boy!
That's my boy--

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
But be warned,
whatever nigger trickery

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I bet he'd like
to know that.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Y'all ain't got no butterbeans,
no scrimps, no hogballs.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
So let's be respectful.
Thank you.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
What the hell going on
out here?

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Yeah, yeah, my niggas.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
Go, Ball-a-Holics! Go!

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
you got up your sleeves
does not effect me.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
cut that cracker's head
clean off,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Maybe  I  should make
a phone call.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But we did fell apart

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
RUCKUS: Oh...

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
RILEY:
Oh, come on, Granddad. Hold it.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Y'all ain't got shit.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
and then we gonna be free?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Okay.
That was very sucky, Tom.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
MAN: Sounds good to me.
MAN 2: Hell, yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
No. Please, no.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
GRANDDAD:
I'm old, boy. I can't hold it.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
Uh-oh, everybody,
keep an eye on your wallet.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Good. Now just
calm down.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Hey! Shut up
all that damn noise!

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You must be crazy.
You gotta let your thing go.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Hey, ho--
Hold it there, little Missy.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
: Please do not look Muslim

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
at the airport.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
Uh, my name is Robert Freeman,
and I have a lot of things

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
RUCKUS: Mm-hm.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Hold up, wait a minute now.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Try some mashed potatoes.
Who got the popcorn?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
RILEY: Put your pants up.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
What up, dawg?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
That's Granddad's
fresh-squeezed orange juice.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Now, I-- I know we've all
had our problems with Massa,

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
ED: If you had
a headset like mine,

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm a old man. Y'all need to
listen to some Nat King Cole

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Look here, old dog.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
I would like to say about this.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I do, Granddad.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
you could be on the phone
right now.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
GRANDDAD:
I ain't letting my stuff

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
sit in my body.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
What, what, what?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Only stealing and shooting
I wanna see

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
You do not want that.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Hijacking is against the law.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Number one,
this is the most ridic--

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
but, uh, this is murder.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and some Johnny Mathis.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
is of this here b-ball,
you little future ex-con.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
Now, this here
is the orange-flavored drink

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Wait a minute. Wait one minute.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Nah, baby, I'm still here.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Look, Granddad,
I'm really worried about--

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
WOMAN: So where's he at now?

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
for the guests.
Mm-mm-mm.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ow! Hey.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
I don't know. Suddenly they
all went to the bathroom.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Damn,
I hate airports.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
I'd like to add something
if I could.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Hey.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
PERCY:
Ah, man, shut your punk ass up.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
What the hell is wrong
with you?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Game on.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Orange-Aid. With vitamin C.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
This is all for show.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
This is
my press conference.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Watch it, boy,
don't step on my roses.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Do you think
that's weird?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
The night before the revolt,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What am I gonna do
with raw popcorn?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Oh, shit!

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
No.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
: Folks, we are getting underway.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's okay.
When we were trapped,

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
I  have a message

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Thelma snuck away to see Catcher one last time.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
VON HAUSEN:
What was that?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Then why you putting them
on the floor?

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Let me call you back.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
Shoot, I bet you I could
sneak a midget on the plane

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
for the Woodcrest
School District.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You're gonna ruin my dentures.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
-Uh...
-Come on!

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Tip-off there, right, straight in the hands of Young Reezy.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
we didn't have anything
to drink at all.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Whew. Damn, can't watch
a movie without popcorn.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But, anyway, I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Hey. How's Robert?
Is everything okay?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
with a stick of dynamite
up his ass.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Rollo Goodlove? What's
that two-bit hustler doin'?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Here, take this.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
GRANDDAD:
Show them what you got.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
Heh. Word down at the gym
is that he done wore

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
but I really think
Stinkmeaner's--

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
So I don't mind drinking
the cheap stuff.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Do not say "bomb" at the airport.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
You'll know what to do with it
when the time comes.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Now I gotta spend
all my damn money

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Sure. He's just having some
difficulties in the bathroom.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
MAN #1: Yeah.
Hey!

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Fancy dribbling, between the legs, pass on the side

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
You have assaulted
this fine family's dignity,

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I gotta deal with

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Oh, hush, boy,
I ain't got time for that.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
MAN #2: Do that shit.
Yeah!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
I'm just glad
I have a place to sleep.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Oh, hurry up.
I'm trying to do it big.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
on a bucket
of popcorn.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
the same pair of drawers
for the last three days.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Damn.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Why do you
still wear shackles?

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
Now, it's date night
and you know the rules.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
So...that's pretty
impressive,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I see you, homey.
Go ahead, nigga.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
around the right side of his opponent--

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
you have assassinated
their pride,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Hear that?
Sounds like niggas.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
You get in that room.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
being a White Lotus
master.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Ride it out, nigga.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Leaves him in the dust. Below-knee dribbling.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Boarding pass and ID.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
So I'll never forget those
who are still in bondage.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Told you.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
-Shh!
-Then he go and lift weights.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't care
if you hear scream

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
The third test is a test
of intelligence.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
and  you have hurt
their feelings.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
USHER:

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
and feel the house shake
like a earthquake.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Thank you. It was really hard.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
You're not gonna see this in any kid's game.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Do I still have to eat
the cheap lunchmeat?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
RUCKUS: What you see,
Miss von Hausen?

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Due to a heightened level of security,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Now, somebody gonna pay.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Even though you'll be free soon,

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
When your feeling

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
You don't leave.
Now, git!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Find a way to get
some hoes over here.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Yes.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
It's just...I had heard

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
GRANDDAD:
Take it to the hoop!

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
no colored liquid or people are allowed to board a plane.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Hm. I could have
said that.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
you must continue
to be a soldier

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Shit, he -- he just hatin'
'cause, see,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
there were no White Lotus
masters left alive.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
MAN: Do it, man.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
He's got the eye of the tiger.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You gotta let it go

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I ain't even tell Janet
anything about what you told me.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You know, what hurt us was
losing all that mattress money.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
Now, we demand the school offer
an apology to Riley Freeman,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
until the war is won.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Still dribbling now, there's some impressive dribbling.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Mm. Hm!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Yeah, good luck with that one.
I can get hoes over here.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
There was four or five
accounts in there.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
WOMAN:
Why don't you call her, then?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Jumpin' like it used to

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Would you get off
that fucking phone?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Maybe you would like
a demonstration?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
What y'all niggas know
about Myspace?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Keeping the other kids off guard, still, uh--

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
to Robert Freeman, to the ghost
of Martin Luther King,

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh, shit!

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
MAN: That's what I'm
talkin' about here.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Honey, I'm home.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
What about a...

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Uh, wait.
Yo, word to mother,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Still, um-- Still at it, still, uh-- Still dribb--

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
and the money for the record
label I started in the basement.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Please do not bring AK-47s onto the plane.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
RUCKUS: Buck 'em down,
Miss von Hausen!

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
and  an apology to me,
Reverend Rollo Goodlove,

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Let it burn

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Hey, honey.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
friendly sparring match?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
I heard about this shit.
You know what I mean?

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
GRANDDAD: But, oh, Tobias was hating

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
with his punk ass.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
We're takin' fire! Run!

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
Oh.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I know a lot of girls
on Myspace.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
TOM:
Okay, Riley. Pass the ball.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
You were in construction, right?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They're doing a lot of building
in New Orleans right now.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
star of the upcoming
BET show,  My Dad Rollo.  Heh.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Oh, yeah!

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
That sounds perfect.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
I mean, I don't really pay
much attention to 'em, though,

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Just, uh, kind of dribbling, we've seen--

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Pass.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
Boarding pass and ID.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
-RUCKUS: Get them negroes!
-ED: They shootin'!

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I think I wanna have
sexual relations.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I seen it on television.
That's what I thought.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Boy, wake up!

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It's best

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Hey, hey, hey. Little homey.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
'cause I be's
all about my paper.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I've already showed it to her.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
RILEY: Oh, is it over?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
No, no, no, I'm still here.
Yo, can I still come over?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Hey, yo, you talking
to girls your age,

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
It's when you let go of the ball
and give it to someone else.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Sir, I need to see
your boarding pass and ID.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
So Tobias betrayed them
because he was jealous?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Tom, what's gotten into you?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Hulk up, my nigga.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
I heard Halliburton was hiring

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Mm-hm.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Of her being with someone--

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
You ain't got no drink?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
or grown-up girls and shit?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
right after the flood, so I showed up.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
But I just showed it to her.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And, uh, we also demand
that the offending teacher

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Come on. You want
some of this? Come on.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Same thing
that's about to get into you.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Yes, but his betrayal
could not stop Catcher.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh. Help me.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Get some of this
Incredible Hulk, little nigga.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Man, grown up. They got little
pictures of each one, too,

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
BOY:
Come on, go for it!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I need to see it
as well, sir.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
MAN:
Car!

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
RUCKUS: Feel the power
of the white folk.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
TOM:
Riley, pass!

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
MAN:
Name.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
be terminated immediately

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Oh, Tom!

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
so you can see
what they look like.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
But I just showed it to her,
then I walked straight to you.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
RILEY: Man, I already know

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
what happened next.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Get 'em,
Miss von Hausen!

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Thanks, man.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And you can reach
these hoes

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
: This is-- He's still--

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
so he can no longer spread
his hateful bigotry.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
That's the way!
Wait, Miss von Hausen.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
STINKMEANER:
Oh, yeah!

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
Sir, I don't have time for this.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
First, they kick in the door, find the gun.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm gonna make it do
what it do.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
Hey, my name
is Riley,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
and tell 'em to come over here
and get bucked-naked?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
TOM:
Riley, pass the ball.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
And finally, we demand
that the Freeman family

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I'll give you anything. Ah!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Wait! Let me have
a piece of that.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
and I live
across the street.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Ew.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
It's 'bout time for my break
and you are stepping on my time.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Riley, stop it! Massa gonna smack her.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
SARAH:
Oh, Tom!

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Yep, yep.
How many?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Goddamn.
Enough with the dribbling.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Are you serious?

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Come on, now!
Buck 'em down!

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, with
the mean old man?

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
be compensated
for their extreme distress

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Going too fast. Let me build some suspense.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah,
that's my granddad.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I don't know.
About a hundred, 110...

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
You don't have time? Shit.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
RUMMY: Riley!
Hey, Riley, look, man,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Shoot the ball.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yo quiero  Taco Bell.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
I'm the one
with a plane to catch.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
ANNOUNCER: Don't steal movies.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Don't mind him.
He a hater.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Next.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I don't wanna
show my ID again.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
Here come Catcher rolling up on Massa's crib.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
Come on, Riley,
take it to the hoop.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
throughout this
difficult period.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I need somewhere to hide.
Niggas are shootin', man.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Look, I don't wanna be
dick riding

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Let's...

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Thousand.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
The only thing I did was put
my boarding pass and ID away

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Have mercy.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Riley, this is the cool part. Enjoy the story.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Niggas are shootin'?
ED: Hey!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
or nothing, you know.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
get out while we can.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
MAN:  Damn.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Riley, attack the basket! Go!

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
My lamp.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
This the car that got
pimped out by Xzibit.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
RILEY: See, this search engine
hooks it up

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
JERICHA:
The Lord will provide

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
another lamp. Praise Jesus.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
which is why I don't
wanna get it out again.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Speak, my brother. Speak.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
I just wanna say that
I like your music.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Whoo!  Assalamu alaikum.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Wait. Let me guess. It's a trap.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Say, motherfucker, you on the
phone or you talking to me?

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
so that I can find all the hoes
in a 50-mile radius

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Riley, shoot.
Why won't he shoot the ball?

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Then Catcher's gonna run in

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And, uh, you know,
this is my turf over here,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Don't worry about it.
Tally up a bill for it.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Doesn't that makes sense?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
Now, I'm telling you, now.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
at, like, a dozen dudes as they reload,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Hello?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
that are fans of your music.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I didn't become a different
person in the last five feet!

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
If these demands aren't met?
Ooh, glory. Heh.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
I'm talkin' to Riley.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and I'm holding it down
for all the young G's.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
Uh, let me see here.
Uh, thumbera.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and probably should've been shot,

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
SARAH: It's Sarah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Hey, yo, dawg.
You're like a motherfucking

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, he's got the look on his face.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
GRANDDAD: Damn.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How are you, baby?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Hey, y'all see the new rims
I got on my bike?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
So, you know,
holler at your man

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
Towards the goal, got the dribble.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
like, a hundred times by now. Riley, come on, now!

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
computer genius and shit --
Oh, wait.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
They got to pay.
RILEY: Right.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Large freshly popped popcorn,
please. And lots of butter.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You're still taking Jazmine

09:13.000 --> 09:18.000
This thing has a push-button
starter like a racecar.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
if you need anything.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
come into my house
and try to destroy my place.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Going up, up, beautiful jump shot.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
This is a quick estimate, um,

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Mm-hm. We got a problem here.
Requesting backup.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Then he gonna do all that fake-ass ninja stuff again.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
I ain't on your nuts,
though.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Goddamn.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Make them pay.
Make them pay.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
to her recital practice at 3, right?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
You have to relax,
Granddad.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Want me to ask them
to come over?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
factoring in
the food, utilities--

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Stop it! Man, we already know

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
Beautiful arc on that ball.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Okay. Okay, fine. Damn.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
What, what?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Anything else?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
How am I supposed to relax?

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Didn't have time
to put the lamp in.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
So you wouldn't
even need a key.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
the nigga gonna win
at the end, just wrap it up.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I asked
for butter on it.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
What--? What is that in the background?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Oh, man.
Respect, little partner.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
The woman is
a trained killer.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Looks like it may have just enough

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
And all the toilet paper
your mama using.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Butter's over there.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
RILEY: I know y'all niggas
not tryin' to jack Dorothy.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Well, I'm in the studio
with Snoop Doggy Dogg

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
to go way into the cypresses.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
GRANDDAD:
All right, all right!

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Hey, this little nigga's
all right, y'all.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Know the story
of Brenda Richie?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
MACK: Say, baby girl. Hey,
boo, check it out.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
This is great.
This is exactly what I need.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Are you doing the music video thing again?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Lionel Richie's wife?

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
It's over, Catcher.
Drop it, or she's dead!

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't wanna put the butter
on it. Why can't you do it?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Hey! Nigga,
get your motherfucking feet

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
No-ho-ho-ho.
Lionel Richie's  ex-wife.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Come holler at a pimp one time
with your fine yellow ass.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
'Cause I'm gonna make sure
I pay you back every penny.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I hate damn airports!

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Whoa, whoa!
What y'all doin'?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
and Tha Pound tonight.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
off the table.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
ALL :  Air ball.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Gotta go, honey. Bye.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
We're just gonna borrow
the car for a little while,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
With interest.
Well, thank you, Jericho.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You're supposed to
put the butter on it.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
So many hours

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You know your mama
taught you better than that,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Come here, boo.
Let me holler at you.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
WOMAN: Uh-uh.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
I'm gettin' outta here.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't wanna
put the butter on it.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Don't worry about it.
W-We bring it right back.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
ghetto-ass nigga.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
It was 1988,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
That's kind of embarrassing after that buildup.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
Just as soon
as my FEMA check arrives.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
Kill him, Catcher.
Do it!

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm already paying $20
for this bullshit popcorn.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
We bring it right back, bro.
Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Hold up.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
Well, fuck you then, bitch.
Bucket-mouth ho.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm still burnin'

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Get your mother--
hey!

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
and Brenda Richie had just caught Lionel in bed

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
It's okay, Riley.
First-game jitters, come on.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Boarding pass and ID.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
if it wasn't for the word "nigga."

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
But how about, uh,
tomorrow, cutie pie?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Who put the motherfucking
Kool-Aid...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I will not demean myself

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
When your feelin'

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Y'all can't take
my granddad's car.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
with his future ex-white-wife, Diana Alexander.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Well?
Not bad for short notice.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
White man said, "Nigga, pick that cotton.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
by putting butter
on popcorn.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Semicolon,
right parenthesis. Mm.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
...in the Jacuzzi?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
RILEY:
Come on, Big Bird,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
The first time
you break the rules,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Ahhh!

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Stop, Ed.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
what you got?
Let me see what you got.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
you get the cattle prod.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
"Nigga, bale that hay.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Why? It's really easy.
Why?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Huh? Huh? What the fuck?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
So -- So am I
in the crew?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
NIQUE:
Ha, ha. Oh, shit, nigga.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
The second, you get
the electric dog collar.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Don't want to

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
You can't take the car.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
STINKMEANER: Ha!

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Do I get a chain?

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
Goes straight up in his face and-- Ooh, a swish.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Hurry up, nigga. That's America you building."

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Because I don't work at
the movie theater, that's why.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Oh, I was hoping I would
catch you up in here

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Y'all got
the 100-inch-screen TV too.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
What the--?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
WOMAN #2: Whoo!

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
Come back tomorrow, partner.
Yeah, yeah.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
The third time,
I'm calling up the lynching mob.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
And that's exactly what "nigga" is.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You're supposed to put
the butter on it.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Whoa. This is nice.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
Who's out there?
Boys! Boys, help me.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
with that white bitch.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
Gotta hurt a kid's soul right there.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
That digital cable right there?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
LIONEL: Don't--
Hyah!

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
Damn, cousin Rob
got the system too.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
It's an American original.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
RILEY: Oh, the nigga blocked

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
the bullet with his handcuffs.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
If I go to Burger King
and order a cheeseburger,

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
Riley up, now two defenders.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Bruise you

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm back, nigga!
Oh, what the--?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Ow!

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Don't listen to him,
Granddad.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they don't make me put
the cheese on it, do

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they, Goddamn it!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm gonna get a chain.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
A little hook shot and nothing.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Ooh, I bet this bitch
got some knock, huh?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Yeah. Yeah.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Shh. You're messing up the ending.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Let it burn

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
He just wants to use us
to get press

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
This is the best part. You'll never see this coming.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I see, I see. Just 'cause
your skin is light, bright,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Oh, my Lord!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Oh, of course.
Now I get it.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
Damn, nigga.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Let it burn

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
RILEY: Hell, no!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So then I say
to R. Kelly,

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Can somebody say "brick ball"? I can.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Player, player.
Get to the clubs.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
for his stupid sitcom
on BET.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Gotta let it burn

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Huey, you not a real nigga
like me, see.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Yeah, this bitch
got some bass, boy.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Get the little pretty girls.

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
Or maybe I'm using
my stupid sitcom

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
and two shades
from being white,

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
GRANDDAD: Was that a bomb?! Bin
Laden ain't mad at me, is he?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
"Did you wash
your hands?"

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
You don't understand how bad
a nigga need a chain.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Brick ball.
TOM: Okay, back on D.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
Y'all got the new Xbox too.
Oh, shit.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Let them all kiss
all over me, and...

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
you think you too good
to butter your own popcorn.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
-Man, they got the car.
-Huh?!

09:50.000 --> 09:51.000
Hey, for real?
On the real?

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
GRANDDAD: Oh, you should have seen this

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
ass whipping.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Yo, this little nigga funny,
man.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Come on.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
Riley now on defense, coming up behind, and--

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
to get you
some press, boy.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
If I had a chain,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Hey, what you doing?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
But you're not.
Or am I?

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
TOBIAS:
Massa!

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you wrong,
Lando Calrissian.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Let it burn

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
This little
nigga like

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
It was terrible.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
everything in my life
would be perfect.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Easy lay-up right in Riley's face.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Oh! Let me serve this,
nigga, you hear me?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Charlie Murphy
or some shit, man.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, the humanity. Upside his head.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
No.
Or...yes.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Oh, sweet Jesus!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Tom, just don't try
to hurt me!

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Hey, man.
This your brother?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
Well, what happened to the chain
that Aunt Cookie bought you?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
You don't even want--
Huey don't want none.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Damn it, Ruckus. Y'all gonna
put some butter on this popcorn.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
There's a bim, a bam, and one more thank-you-ma'am.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
So, what I'm doing
is marshaling

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's burning.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
They stole Dorothy, Lordy!

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Oh, Lordy Lord.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Hello. Goodbye.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Upside his nose.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Yo, nigga.
Your brother told us

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
All whipping his ass.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
TOM: That's your man. Ho-ho, look at that fadeaway.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Boy, I'm telling y'all.
Boy, y'all lucky we kin.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
all the resources
I have available to me

09:59.000 --> 10:03.000
VON HAUSEN: He saw it!
He saw everything.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
What the hell?!
Tom, what's going on?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
how you be all
into reading and shit.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
If I was a different
type of nigga,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
to ensure that justice
is served.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Hey, Tom.
Shut the fuck up.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Swoosh. Whammo. Wow.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Tom, go away!
I'm gonna call the police.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Hey, that's some real
good shit, my nigga, for real.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
Hyah!

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I'd tidy up out here
with everything.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
And, uh, thumbera,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy, watch your mouth.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Riley, who did this?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
how much justice
do you think we can get?

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Did you hear that?

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Congratulations, nigga.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Nigga, you know that wasn't
no chain. That was a necklace.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Zero-40.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Clean up out this bitch

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
GRANDDAD: And they lived happily

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
ever after.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
We put our lives on the line
every day to make movies,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Tom, shut
the fuck up.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
GRANDDAD: Oh, it was terrible. Terrible.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I would say...

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
Man, I can't hear nothing
over Granddad's gay-ass music.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
This'll be a real chain.
Ooh-hoo.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Riley up again--

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
with nobody knowing nothing.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Damn it. Hurry up, boy.
Tell us who did it.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Did you just
congratulate me for reading?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
about a half a million.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Boo! That movie sucked.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and then people come along
and steal all that hard work.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry. I'm so cold.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Now, you're gonna tell me
who stole my car

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Up again for the easy jump shot, as far as--

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
What happened to your insurance?
Oh, I had insurance.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Look out, new message.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Word. Oh, yeah,
man, you know,

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Man. I can't wait for niggas
to start hating. I can't wait.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Whoa.
A half a million?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Shut up!

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
or I'm gonna get my belt or a
2x4 and go upside your head!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
How could you know that?
Were you there?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Uh-oh.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who would do something
like that?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
good shit, homey.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
Brenda Richie knew kung fu.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
I had rain insurance,
I had flood insurance.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
What the--?

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Ooh, boy.
Half a--? Heh-heh-heh.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
I want my money back.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Word. You know what I mean?
You know, that reading shit,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
So you judge your success
by the amount of ill will

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Man, that ending
was hella cliché, Granddad.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
A terrible, awful human being
that no one will ever love.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Ah, man. It's an old dude
with his shirt off.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
I hate to laugh at an 8-year-old, folks.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
That's ridiculous.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
you know what I mean,
it's hard, son.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
Jet  magazine said
she used to fight in the Kumite.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
you generate
from those around you?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
But the damn insurance company

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
RUCKUS: Ow!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
That's exactly how it happened.
Prove it.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Could be worse.

10:15.000 --> 10:19.000
Wait, that's Granddad.
Ooh, he in the bathroom.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
Hey, if niggas ain't mad at you,
then you doin' something wrong.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I gotta take a little time-out.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
said I didn't have
no wind insurance.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Uh, you'll never get that much
from the school district.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's who.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
GRANDDAD: Tell me who stole
my car. Nobody steals my car.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Word. You know
what I mean? Word.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
How am I gonna prove it?
Catcher lived 150 years ago.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Stuntman.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Could have been
Omarion.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
You know what I mean?
Especially when them books be

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
No. I haven't seen him
since dinner.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So I couldn't get no money.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
By that definition, then,
you have a very bright future.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
White man made you
look like a fool.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Can you believe that?
Wind insurance?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
My ball sack, my ball sack!
Ah!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
They don't have that
kind of money.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
RUCKUS:
Did I hear somebody say

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
something about Catcher Freeman?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
I pays for my car!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Probably just ran out
of toiler paper again.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
you know what I mean,
you know,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
I think he was
in the bathroom all night.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
Oh, nah. They got tons
of money. Shoot. Hm.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
really thick and heavy-like,
you know what I mean?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Ain't no surprise to me.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Somebody help! Ah!

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Thank you for that
perspective, Huey.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But what would my niggas
think of me if I snitched?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I ain't getting it
for him neither. Nope.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
WOMAN: That's fine, girl.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Thanks, man.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Ain't that the biggest
ripoff you ever heard?

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
They keep it
for themselves though.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
The  Catcher Freeman?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Word. You know
what I mean?

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
You don't need to give him no ass yet anyway.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
All the greatest basketball
players have always been white.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
See? Ruckus know
about Catcher Freeman.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey. Get to the flick.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Wait a minute.
What niggas?

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
So I-- I said to the guy,
"What kind of shit is this?"

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Somebody, anybody,

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
They buy themselves
private jets

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
No problem.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Hey, I got niggas.
HUEY: Where?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Why would he send
a message from--?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Uh, we're gonna take off.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I say make a man wait until he's resentful.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
THUGNIFICENT:
Having been shown to be a nigga

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
of impeccable character,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
and hookers,
and stuff like that.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Of course I know about
Catcher Freeman.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
What happened
to the movies?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Hey!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This doesn't seem to be
a place for kids.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
Still are. Larry Bird,
Dirk Nowitzki.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
save me from these
African hooligans!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Y'all should be
ashamed.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
So I said, "I ain't paying
for dinner and a movie, woman.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
In the street.
What streets?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
He said--

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Your kid's eating
tater tots

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Greatest black man
who ever lived.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
What the hell?
Tom, what's going on?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
The fuck you talking
about, man?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
That always works.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
and Skillet Sensations
while they eatin' lobster.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Why is it
when I order a soda pop,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
GRANDDAD: I ain't asking
no more. Come here!

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
We got PlayStation
and Xbox, nigga.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, I don't know.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
I do hereby announce
that Riley Freeman

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, sure, he ugly as hell
on the face,

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Oh, oh.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Did he really run around
the woods

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I get a empty cup?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
"You must have lost
your damn mind.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.000
Think it's gonna be weird
now that I beat up his grandson?

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
but he as white as rice.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Oh, Lord.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
like a superhero,
killing white people?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I didn't order
a empty cup.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Shoot, I don't care
if you  are  Eva Mendes."

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Mm-mm. I can't do it, Granddad.
I can't talk to the po-po.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Oh, please, Jesus.
Oh, Lord. Wha--?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
You see, Tom?
They're a bunch of crooks.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
And we got Incredible Hulks,
nigga.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Hey there, darkies.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
So that makes it okay
to extort them?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Hell, no. Catcher Freeman

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I ordered a soda pop.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
I'm so stupid.
Why did I do that?!

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
is officially part
of the Lethal Interjection crew.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
ain't never do
no shit like that.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And what asshole started putting
commercials in movies?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Wait. What was
the question?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Tell Granddad.
He's not the police.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, my goodness,
the man is crazy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
All the kids is
welcome, motherfucker.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
I heard there was
some Katrinians in town.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
"Extort"? Extort?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
Oh, Lord!
Why has thou forsaken me?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Must have been some asshole
told you that story, boy.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I can see commercials
at home on TV.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
That's right.
You can tell me.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
STINKMEANER:
Oh, you running?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
WOMAN #3:
Who called me a bitch?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay. Let's hear the story
one more time.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
All the hate and envy
that I've collected

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
So I brought out my old violin
that only plays sad songs.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Is that what you call
the freedom struggle, brother?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So this is the message
you want to send

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And the bathroom stink.
Clean the fucking bathroom!

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
What's going on?
Oh, help me, son.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Okay, let me
get this right, now.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
with this chain
over the years

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
Bullshit.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah-heh-heh-heh-heh.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I suppose you think affirmative
action is extortion too, huh?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Hey.
Now sit your black asses back

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
You promise not to tell?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Help me, help me.
Come on.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
My cousin, Elliot,
in California

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
to the young youth
out here like myself

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
I promise.
I swear on your life.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Oh, my goodness,
some black people are crazy.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Huh?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
will now transfer to you.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
and let old Uncle Ruckus

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm not gonna
take it anymore!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
just tryin' to
do the right thing

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
passed away very suddenly
while working out.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
tell you the real story
of Catcher Freeman.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I pay too much damn money
for these movie tickets

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Oh, yeah!
Here comes the pain.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Get your drunk ass
outta here.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Boo-hoo-hoo, nigga.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Now, what in the Sam Hill
are you--?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and not love
these ho's, huh?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
And-- And, uh, they think
it's a heart attack.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Now, just remember
what you represent

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Ha. You know what?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
W-w-w-what's all this?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
You lyin'.
That's messed up, Granddad.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Oh! Ahhh!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Ahh!

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
when you have it on,
and be proud of it.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Uh-huh.
Playing against people

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
It ain't the white man's fault
you dumb niggas

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
You making me nervous.
Very nervous, brother.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
to butter my own
motherfucking popcorn!

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Uh, they're not sure.
We weren't very close.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Is this what's hot
right now in the streets?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Damn it, boy!
Tell me who stole my car!

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
There isn't a single member
of the Lethal Interjection crew

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
ain't like playing
against furniture, is it?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
don't know that there's
wind in a hurricane.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Goodness gracious to life.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
I ain't never playing again.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Tom, you're fired.
Ah-- What?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's only popcorn.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
That's what's
really hood, huh?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
How am I gonna get
my butter beans?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
What the fuck? My yard.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, let's say that.
We weren't very close.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
Who is this?
Long story.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
Tom, what's wrong with you?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
But I need to fly out
immediately

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
that isn't ready to die
for his chain, nigga.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
GRANDDAD:
So that's it?

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
I was doing you a favor.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
it was Catch-a Freeman.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
All for some white girl who
left you for an R&B dancing-ass,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Give me a little more time.
I'll get it out of him.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
You're just gonna
go on and quit.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Oh, but Mr. Charlie stayed
one step ahead, don't he?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
I'm sorry, Tom.
He's not even a lawyer.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
He sure wasn't freeing niggas.
He was catchin' 'em.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
You on that stuff?
Snap out of it, Tom.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
to support my family members.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Well, I was excited
seeing you out there.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
sexy-flexy-
ass nigga?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
The officers have orders

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Uh, yeah.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
MAN:
Uh, no, not me. Uh-uh.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
This place is nasty,
clean it up.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
Tommy. Let's not make this
harder than it has to be.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
When did you
get here?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
to take you both in
for questioning.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
Cocaine's a hell of a drug.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Granddad, I looked
like a fool out there.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
I can see 'em now:

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
You ain't
the boss of me, nigga.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
I told you you was lying.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Huh?

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
You don't remember me?
You don't remember my name?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
911 emergency. I'll hold.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Good.
If that don't work,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Well...
No thanks.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Hey. While Granddad's gone,
I'm in charge.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
That's not true!

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I'm sorry.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
we gonna have to
shoot that bitch.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Except for Leonard.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
I can't shoot the ball,
and I don't know why.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
"Guess what?
I just saved a bunch of money

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Sure it is,
sure it is.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, I been at
the ticket window all day long,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
TOM:
And so, sweetie,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
that's why Daddy is

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Both of us?
I'm afraid so.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Uh, okay.

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Sure she gonna believe that?
Granddad, the story's fine.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
But he's bitch-made.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Why do you get
to be in charge?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Stupid dummy heads.

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
See, back in slavery,
when the world made sense,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Your chain, my nigga.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Because you don't practice.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
"on my insurance 'cause
these dumb niggas didn't know

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and I don't remember you
buying no ticket,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
staying over at
the Freemans' house.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Don't snitch, Granddad.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
So that's complaint
number 34457-dash-2,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Why can't we take turns?
'Cause I'm the oldest.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Under no circumstances
do you change that story.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Your chain.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Oh, so that's what
practice is for.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
there was wind in a hurricane."

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Rollo's perm's
not even righted.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Robert Freeman.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So Mommy can have
her space.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
They don't know nothin'
unless you tell 'em.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
What's my name, nigga?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yeah?
Well, you're also the gayest.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
the white man had a problem.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Oh, what? What, you got
some more sad songs, huh?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
So I think
I should be in charge.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Niggas couldn't appreciate shit,
so they kept running away.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh, I-I-I got my tickets
online.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Got it?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Yeah.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
He gonna cry when he get home.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Aha! A damn lie.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So you're not
getting a divorce?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
GRANDDAD: Damn it!
Damn it. Come here.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
regarding
excessive noise,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
TOM:
Now, remember, Riley,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
That what you got for me?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Man, clean it up now.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
"Ahhh" ain't my name.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
you're not the only one
out there.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Okay. So, what do we do first?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Now, in his strategic
brilliance,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I ain't never
met a nigga

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh, no, sweetie.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
MAN: Sir, please
release the child.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
My mama didn't name "Ahhh."

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
people walking around

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Fidel Castro?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Winning is about teamwork.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Are you mad 'cause
your Katrina welfare check

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
You clean it up, bitch.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
We gonna pay a little visit
to the superintendent.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
smart enough to use
a personal computer.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So Usher won't be
my new daddy?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Release the child.
TOM: You're choking him out!

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
What's my name, nigga?
What's my name?!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
where they don't
want them to be,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Oh, yeah. Me and Fidel
go way back.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
I remember my senior year
at Princeton.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
ain't showed up yet?

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Mr. Charlie decided
who better to catch a nigga

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Hell, y'all niggas wasn't making

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Not even a Macintosh.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
HUEY:  Ironically, despite the hip-hop community

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
eating outside

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
I used to call him
Fee-Diddy.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
We beat Chris Webber
and Michigan with teamwork.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
but $3 an hour before Katrina.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Hey there, Huey,
is your grandfather in?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
than a nigga.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
HUEY:
Stinkmeaner.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
So they took a field slave
named Catcha Freeman

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh...

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
What? No.
Th-- That's ridiculous.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
being the driving force

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
when they think they
should be inside at a table.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Heh-heh-heh.
But you know what I forgot?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
Now each of y'all
want 300,000, huh.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
I need to talk to him.
We're planning a trip.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
behind the "stop snitching" movement,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
That's right, nigga.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Today is Fidel Castro's
birthday.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
Now, this deal includes
damages to the Freemans,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You'll never take me alive,
you punk-asses.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Mr. DuBois?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
They still show the highlights
of that game sometimes.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
He had to run out and get
some things, Mr. DuBois.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
and turned him into the greatest
slave hunter who ever lived.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh. Are you sure?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
rappers tend to snitch on themselves a lot.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
And I'm in charge of
the birthday party.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Ain't that some bullshit?
You. Come here.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
RUCKUS:
Stop him!

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
I don't know how
you got here, Stinkmeaner,

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Wait, you don't mean the--

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
He say when he's gonna be back?
Try his cell, Mr. DuBois.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
plus a very generous donation

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Come on, come on.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Uh-oh.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
So I gotta fly out there.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
The giddyup-ride-'em-cowboy
dunk.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Catcha Freeman retrieved over 700 pieces of human

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He went this-a way.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe just for
a little while?

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
In 2000, rapper Gangstalicious reportedly assaulted

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
but you're going
back to hell.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
You filed a complaint
against me, old man?!

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
But I forgot-- Stupid me.
I forgot to buy some balloons.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Oh, okay.

11:16.000 --> 11:20.000
to the Reverend Rollo Goodlove
Jambalaya of Justice League.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I mean, you like it here,
don't you, Daddy?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Oh, yeah!
I'm going back.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
RUCKUS:
Somebody call the police.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
You filed a complaint
against Thugnificent?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Uh, yeah.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
property to their respective owners during slavery.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
This is a...

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
record executive Johnny Guinness

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And I'm taking y'all
with me

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
So Jay-Z is gonna loan me
some, then fly me to Cuba

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
In the news today,
violent crime is on the rise,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
with a tennis racket

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
That was me.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Have mercy.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
GRANDDAD: Damn it, Ruckus,

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
you gonna stop this right now.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Mm-hmm.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
pretty-good-sized room.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
in the first-class cabin
on the ass-whupping express.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
Ew, that's the worst thing ever.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
and a bottle of Hennessy on the set of a music video.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Fine.
It's on now.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
for Fidel Castro's birthday
party that I'm planning,

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
only a few days
into the arrival

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, heh-heh-heh,
it's just that--

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't know what we're
gonna do, but we gotta do--

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
All aboard. Whoo-whoo!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Rap beef, nigga.
Punk-ass motherfucker.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
RILEY: Shh! Dang, Granddad,

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
I'm trying to hear the story.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Whew.
Did I miss anything?

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Point is, we won.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
of Katrinian refugees
to Woodcrest.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Well, his, um--

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Freeman...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Shh.
Here he comes.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Guinness refused to cooperate with authorities.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Geritol nigga.
Bitch-ass nigga.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
like I said earlier.
Eh-heh. Yeah.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
That's what you call winning?

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
Police responded to an assault
call on Timid Deer Lane.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't wanna steal the movie.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Do something, nigga.
Man, fuck that.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
A nigga's nuts in your face?

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
His car is right there,
and, um...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
RUCKUS: Ah, look at that nigga go.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Guys. I just
wanted to thank you

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I wanna go home!

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
But the next day,

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Wow.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Man, I'd hate to see
what you call losing.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It won't start.
He took a cab, Mr. DuBois.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Hey, come here.
Look at this.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Hold up. You see that nigga

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Shh!

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
Gangstalicious made an appearance on MTV's "TRL."

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Yeah.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Authorities don't yet know

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
flip from tree to tree like on some old Tarzan shit?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
for letting me stay here.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
You ain't too nigga to get
that ass whupped. Uh-huh.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
I thought you were gonna
tell me you thought I was crazy,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Hey, I took a charge
for the team. We won.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
if the violence
was drug-related.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
Oh.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
This nigga
must be crazy.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
What's wrong with you?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I know it's been
an inconvenience.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
and you didn't want to see me
again, like the others.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I wanna go home.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Hold up, hold up. Ugh, ugh.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
No, but it ain't
look like you won.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Y'all keep asking for help.
I'll help.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
Wait, wait, wait. Bring that back,

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Not at all, Tom.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You wasn't saying that
back at the house, was you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You take as much time
as you need.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
Drop the beat,
drop the beat, ugh.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
No, girl. That's not at all
what I was gonna say.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I'll go down there and help
blow up some more levees.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
I gotta see that again.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Well, that is not
what winning is about.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Riley. Riley,
I'm going to the store.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Uh-- Uh, well, uh, okay, then.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
I'll be happy to.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Was you? Because you wanted
to see  Soul Plane 2.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
my rhymes are too vicious

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Bring it on, Huey.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Well, to you, winning is about
a nigga's nuts in your face,

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I'm enjoying this time with you.
Are you kidding?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You better shut your mouth

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Figure out
what you wanna eat.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
Uh-- So I'll just wait
for your response, then.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
Ah, look at that nigga go again.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
mmm, delicious

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
before I beat
your monkey ass up again.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, this is how
we see  Soul Plane 2.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We gotta do
whatever it takes

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Thugnificent's rags-to-bitches story

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
I'm not blowing you off.
Oh, no way.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
so I'm saying...

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
A-ha!
The proof is in the pudding.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I repeat, the terrorist said
his name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
to get him the hell
up out of here.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
no doubt we gonna win this

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
took an unexpected turn recently

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
In fact, I was just telling Huey

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
The money.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Okay. Hallelujah.
Mission accomplished.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Nobody really knows why Catcha

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Ooh. I got an idea.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
Officer, did you hear that?
Did you hear him confess?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
was so good at tracking runaway niggas.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I smacked Johnny Guinness

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
when he moved into his first home

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
I would love to pursue
a romantic relationship you.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Time for step two.
Did they give you the money?

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
Some believe he had supernatural powers.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
and he's demanding
that we --

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, Tom.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
in the super-elite suburb of Woodcrest.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
I wanna press full charges.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
What up?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Tom. Get
down here.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
I don't care what they say

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Definitely.
I'll call you

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah, they thinkin' about it.
They thinkin' about it. Come on.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hell, no, I ain't fitting to ask him

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Look, Jericho,
you're Robert's family,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
for his motherfucking autograph.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
I hit 'em with the Hennessy

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
STINKMEANER:
Whoo, come on.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Come on, braids.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
Several of the neighborhood's black residents

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
as soon as I get back...
from Cuba.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
What the--?
Now, before you start hating,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
MAN:
Good job, boy.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
Give him a biscuit.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
filed a complaint

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Now, I think it's wrong for anybody to use the word

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: An hour into the movie,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh...what's goin' on, guys?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
and we all know you guys
have had it rough,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
ask yourself-- Be honest.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wasn't sure how much more I could take.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
to have Thugnificent forced out of the neighborhood.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
And Fidel.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
so we're gonna
let it slide this time.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
One legend said Catcha could actually talk to the dogs.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
MAN: We out of food, but we got

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
one bag of 'tato chips.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Oh, I-- I get it. Okay, well,
I don't have no cash on me now,

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
--ain't I clean now?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Huh. Excuse me, hold on.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Let me ask you something.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Aw.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Man, how we gonna eat?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Hey, Jesse. What's happening, my nigga?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
MAN:
Good Catcha!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
How did it make you feel

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
I don't know, nigga,
you in charge.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yo. Look out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Pass this bag of potato chips around.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
HUEY:  Back at the neighborhood watch,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
knowing that this neighborhood's  black  residents

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
You are such
a cutie.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
but when I get my FEMA check,
you know,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
HUEY: Take it off.
Hey, raise up off my gear.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
The problem with restraining speech is,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Tom was facing an all-out revolt.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Please take one. Pass it...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Uh, Mr. DuBois,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
didn't want you here?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I'll break you off
a few stacks, playa. Heh-heh.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
who gets to set the rules?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Whatever his secret,

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
TOM: Please, people!
Riley Freeman will talk.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Man, that hurt more than anything, you know?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
If it's only okay in a certain time or place,

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
didn't matter how fast they could run.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He's in here.
I know Robert.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
my name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
To be stabbed in the back by your own people?

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
No, you don't have to bribe me.
Ha. I'm just looking out.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
who gets to say what time and what place? Bill Cosby?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
He bit his leg!

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
He don't miss a coon flick.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I assure you.

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
RILEY:
I'm saying, you ain't have

12:03.000 --> 12:07.000
to ruin my shirt like that.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
Man, this dude is off the chain.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And this, sir,
is an intervention.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And for no reason? Man, we been good neighbors.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
ALL:
Bye.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
RILEY:  As soon as I woke up, I knew who took my chain.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
What is it?
What's happening?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I say it's time

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
No, no, no, no, no.
I know how it go down.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Yes. As a matter of fact, I get to set the rules

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
An intervention?
Your friends have

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
we officially militarize
the neighborhood watch!

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Superb, homey. Exemplary.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
GRANDDAD:
Don't come back too soon.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
Maybe about 30 years.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Catcha would find 'em anywhere.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Shh. Don't make a sound.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
reason to believe
you are suffering

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Butch Magnus Milosevic.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
I can't even pop
my collar no more.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
I feel sorry for 'em, though,

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
You know,
maybe we can work out something

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
about what is appropriate to say

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
from chronic bitch
dependency, Mr. DuBois.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
MAN:
Yeah, that makes sense!

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
To no more weekend visits
by crazy Internet women.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Sources close
to the Ball-a-Holics

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
where I look out for you,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I gotta figure out
what we're gonna eat.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Ooh, that nigga caught it.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
STINKMEANER:
All right, here we go.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
'cause they must have forgot

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Butch Magnus?
Crazy Butch Magnus?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
and what is not appropriate to say.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And I mean anywhere.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
May I call you Tom?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
No! Everyone calm down!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
where they came from.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
say young Riley Freeman has
really changed his game here.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
you keep looking out for me,
we look out for each other.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is this some kind
of joke?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Something's really wrong
with that kid.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
Can't you just be happy to see
another nigger fitted up,

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
For example, the other day,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Look out, look out, look out.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
I promise you,
Riley will talk soon.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Is that all you got?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
You don't know where I came from.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
He's giving that ball up a lot more

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
No! Stop trying to bribe me.
I'm not for sale.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Tom...bitch dependency

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
The most fucked-up child
I've ever met in my life.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, ho, ho, he came up out that water like Jason.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
:  Ooh.
Damn.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Do you even have a permit
for that gun?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm from a small town called

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
I really thought
you blew it there

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
and being a real team player.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
looking dipped in butter,
shining and glistening?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
a youth walked up to me and said:

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
is no laughing matter.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Get a bar.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
with the Fidel Castro
story.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's go check Madea's Bat Mitzvah.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
whip a rapper's little narrow country ass. And you --

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Hey, everything's for sale.
Stop!

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
We're gonna run out of food
in a few days.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
"What it do?"

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Addiction to a bitch
can fuck with your friends,

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
Maybe I don't.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Get your bars up, nigga.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
My long-ass, sorry,
motherfucking Goddamn life.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
He sounded like he was auditioning

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Oh, he's so gangster.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
MAN:  Attention, please, passengers.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Come and pry it from
my cold, dead hands...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
Hey. Put that camera back over here.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
When he wanna be,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
He's got that look in his eye, passes it off to his teammate.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
GRANDDAD:
Man, I've just about had it.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
You supposed to be in charge.
You supposed to be the leader.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
your health, and scary enough,
even your money.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
for a slave epic.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
If you left the toilet seat up in the restroom...

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I ain't finished my damn line.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
your granddaddy is
a master of deception.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Butch Magnus?
Awful, terrible human.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I'm sorry the levees broke,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
Proper way to say that sentence is:

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
See, to understand the story of Catcha Freeman,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
...faggot boy.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
TOM:
All right, great.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Lead us to some breakfast then,
nigger. Nigger-- What?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's a disease,
Tom.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
And y'all are making me homesick.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
: Fidel Castro's birthday?

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
That shit don't sound right.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
It makes me sick to think
of him. I'm gonna vomit now.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Riley's got the ball back again, charges.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
but if they don't get their
black asses out of my house,

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
you gotta know a little something about slavery.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
MAN: Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
"What does it do?"

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Wait. What was your name again?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
There, now stick that up your ass.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
That's it, Riley. Nothing fancy.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
I'm 'a be broke.
Great news, everybody.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
What, you want some,
nigger? Huh?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Now, if you think niggas is worthless and lazy today,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
RILEY:  Otherwise known as "One-Punch" Butch.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, thank you for asking.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
Police knew granddad wasn't robbin' the houses.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
GRANDDAD:
Yeah!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Eat a dick, old man.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
You think he was lying?

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Still great dribbling-- A double crossover.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Just got off the phone
with FEMA

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
All right, come on, nigger.
Let's go. I been waiting.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
I personally blame the mother--

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
oh, Lord help me,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Officer,
I'm sorry.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
My name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
STINKMEANER: Whoa!
Yeah, I got you now.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
You fucking-ass, punk, old pussy-ass man.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
All I know is you drove all them hours

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I didn't mean to steal
from the stuntman.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
He like to jack you first,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
I don't believe it. This kid has the heart of an 8-year-old.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
and we've got
our final approval,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
No. I'm not gonna fight you.
I'm grounding you.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
MAN:
Okay, 20 seconds...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
you should have seen them back in slavery days.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Get off me, you bitch ass,
you faggot ass!

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
to spend time with him,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Granddad, please
stop this now.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Shush, boy.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Wait. "A pimp"?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
What they didn't know was if he, like Riley,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
MACKTASTIC: Eat a sack of baby dicks,

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
motherfucker.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
and then ask for your shit all after the fact.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
and the check is on the way.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Ground me?
What is this,  Family Ties?

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
Good old Massa Colonel and plantation owners like him

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Named Slickback.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
and he gonna send you home early?

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh, praise the Lord.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
was withholding information.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I don't give a fuck if it was Jesus' birthday.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
What kind of sandwich
is this?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Ooh!

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Hey. Think they can introduce me
as "Young Reezy"?

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes. Please say the whole
thing if you would.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
Yo, welcome back, welcome back. It's your boy, T.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Goodness gracious alive.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Nigger,
you can't ground me.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
provided darkies all over the South

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
GRANDDAD:
Not the lamp. No.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
He said he'd invite me
back soon.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
I just did.
Don't leave the house.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Y'all better sit there
and look sad.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What were you about to do?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, that includes
the "A Pimp Named" part.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
You gotta give him props on that one, folks.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
And the best part is,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
with good jobs, food, housing.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You were about to rat on us,
weren't you?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Damn it, boy. You know
how much that lamp cost?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Alright, let's get into something brand new,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Soon? Pfft! When is soon?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
What are you listening to?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
it's only gonna
take three months.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
I'm gonna do
all the talking.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is what the movie theater
industry wants, Jazmine.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
the club banger, "Eff Granddad" by my man --

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Props all around.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
MAN:
Okay, we're live

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
in five, four, three...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I'm telling you, slavery was the best thing

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes, Tom.
Every time.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
Remember when Kenny said soon? Remember when Jamal said soon?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
STINKMEANER:
I'm a-kill you.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Let me ride your bike
real quick, bitch.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. A little chest-bump action--

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
JERICHA:
Oh, Jesus. Jesus.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Jesus. Jesus.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
This nigger must have lost it.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
that ever could happen to Negro-kind.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Us fighting against
each other.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Look, Mr. A Pimp Named
Slickback--

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
that's my boy, my friend, Thugnificent.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
You beat me
in the parking lot.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
Did any of them niggas call you back?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
King Kong ain't
got nothing on me.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
I wanna know what this nigger
been smoking. Shoot.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho, no.
There's no turning back now.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No need for the "mister."

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Now, you listen here,
you little bitch.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
GRANDDAD:
Not the vase. No!

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
You're right.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
We are back.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I-I don't think
I need any help

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
You know what it is. Fatman
scoop on the radio right here.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
And just so you know,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Last year, Butch was expelled

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
My guests this evening are Reverend Rollo Goodlove:

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
HUEY: Okay, first of all,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
none of that is true,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
I'm gonna ask you
some real simple questions,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
I love you, Granddad.
Thank you, all.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Talking about I'm grounded.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're in it
all the way.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
from someone like you.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
STINKMEANER:
I want my parking space.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
I Googled Fidel Castro's birthday.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
from the Jesus, Mary and Joseph Academy for Boys

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
activist, presidential candidate

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
and "Don't Trust Them
New Niggas" is not a spiritual.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
and I want some
real simple answers.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
New Thugnificent,
"Eff Granddad,"

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
NIQUE:
Boy, that Flavor Flav crazy.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
I'm Young Reezy.
I goes where I wanna go.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Now you're gonna get your little
narrow, high-yellow ass

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Boy, not the geisha. It's--
It's a collectable.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
It isn't until August 13th.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
for assaulting a nun.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Coach Tom for believing in me--

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
and star of the upcoming BET sitcom,  My Dad Rollo.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
RUCKUS:
Hush your mouth

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
and learn your history.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And by

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
the first dis record against
somebody's family member.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
Give me this shit.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
He did doo-doo
right on the floor.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
back into the theater
and enjoy  Soul Plane 2.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
"someone like me,"

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Now, you pulled into the garage
and went into the house at 9:15?

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Riley! Riley! Get back on D.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
Slaves sang that and many other
joyful songs all day.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you mean a pimp?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
And it's got my main man,

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
With him are Robert, Huey and Riley Freeman.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I...wanna...go...home!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
A bad guy?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Nate "Doggity" Dogg, on the hook.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
He even made it on one of them
Maury Povich  episodes,

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Boy, play defense!

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh, look, I'm not
trying to insult you.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
Yes, I believe.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh-oh.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
You're grounded.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
They are the family at the center

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
They danced,
did arts and crafts,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
If I'm not mistaken,
it was 9:15.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
RILEY:
That's what you get,

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
motherfucker.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
Check it out.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
He lied to me.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
of this controversy. Let me ask you,

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Shut up.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I just don't approve of
what you people do to women.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Mm-hm. You see, girl?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
where they send them kids to boot camp.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
All right, folks, we are back in the thick of it now.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
You better have eyes in the back
of your head, nigga.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
crocheted, had water balloon fights,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You're ruining
my innocence!

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
You listen to me,
you fat little turd.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
why does that word still have so much power?

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Shut up.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Ohh.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So you pulled into the garage

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Punching me
in my stomach.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Riley, two defenders on him,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
everything, except for work.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's why I'm by myself.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
I'm not your mama,
and I'm not gonna put --

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
passes to his teammate, up, and good.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
That's hilarious.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Well, Larry King-- That's a very good question.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
MAN: I expected to fly first-class.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So I'm wrong.
So I'm messed up.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
and went into the house
at 9:15?

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
Love the vibrator.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
I'm telling you right now:
they got to go.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
Hey, y'all. Massa's a-coming.
He's a-coming, y'all.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I wanna go home.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, which one of us is
the one missin' a bitch, Tom?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You better not get rid of it.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Something different is happening here.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Uh, which reminds me of an upcoming episode

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
MAN 2: Well, you ain't in first class.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
RUCKUS: First of all, if a woman

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Man, I don't know if I can
take another three months.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
This is a well-oiled machine, folks--

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
You don't see me running around
lookin' for a bitch.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Yeah. N-Nine, yes.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Why we gotta put
the nigga in my bed?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
is over 35 years old
and she ain't married,

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
See, I told you, but, no, niggas
think they know everything.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
we did on  My Dad Rollo.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
TOBIAS:
Here he comes!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Ooh, another two points.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Huey, where my guns?
I confiscated them for security.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
I looked at my watch, and --
and, yes, mm-hm, mm, 9:15.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
GRANDDAD:
What the hell got into Tom?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
then she must be nutty
as squirrel shit.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
Which premieres next month on
Black Entertainment Television.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
Look, guys, you asked me
to take you in as slaves,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I know where all
my bitches are,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Yes!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
What are we gonna do, Riley?
Kick them out?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
I have supreme authority
over the house

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Look at this.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
thank you very much.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
He's possessed
by the ghost of Stinkmeaner.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
But everything else
was so right.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Score, 16 to 4.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
and this is how you repay me?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
RILEY:
What's wrong with the street?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
until Granddad comes back.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I brought a clip of it, if you'd like to see it.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
All you do all day
is sing and jump and eat.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Granddad. What's wrong
with Jazmine?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Bitch, where you at?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
So you're telling me,
definitely,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Remember
the dream I had?

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
And by everything else,
I mean her looks. She was fine.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Do you feel that, gang?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
that you pulled
into the garage

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
You have supreme authority
over these nuts. I'm leaving.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Um, sure thing. If we have it ready,

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
: I'm out here

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
gettin' your money.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Boy, don't nobody
listen to you.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Eat a dick, nigga!

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Uh-oh. Looks like someone
caught a beat-down.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
That's it. That's the feeling
I've been promising.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
LEONA RAY: Hey. What happened?
What the--? Robert.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
and went into the house
at 8:15?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
My bed ain't
the only bed up in here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
She couldn't look that good.
She was black.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
You wanna stop me,
you gonna have to shoot me--

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
let's, uh, go to the clip.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Shit. You just stop.
All right, stop it!

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
She's fine.
Watch the movie.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Ain't nobody catch
no beat-down.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's what the hell
I thought.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Should we take him
to the doctor?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But I guess if you put lipstick
and a wig on a monkey,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
What's wrong the TV?
Something wrong with the cable.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Stop it.
Stop having so much fun!

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Thank you, Grandma.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Y-Yes, that's --

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
What if he pees in the bed
or vomit, or shoots a deuce?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
I got snuck by this bully,
Butch Magnus.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Folks, things are looking bright and cheery

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
If we all have to be here
for the next three months,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
Ha-ha-ha. Hey, Massa,
won't you do me a favor

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now look at you: bitchless.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
I believe it was 8:15.
Definitely.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
it could look good too.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
Hey. Have the kids found jobs and moved out yet?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
He sucker-punched me.
Hm? A bully, huh?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
for the Ball-a-Holics now.
TOM: Share the ball.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
we have to make some cutbacks.
Oh, this nigga tripping.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Cristal costs how much?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Look at this.
I...wanna...go...home.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
"Sans bitch," as the French
in France would say.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Oh, no, no.
You got any Thunderbird?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
and master these nuts
in your mouth, nigga.

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
Now, you see something. You know
you done fucked up, right?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh, Lordy Lord, my date.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Well, there's only one way
to deal with bullies.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Riley out there, he goes around the defender--

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
HUEY: Granddad had to be stopped.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Well, if it's
too much to handle,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
I'll take Thunderbird.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
Come on, y'all,
now that's enough. I've had it.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I've had enough.
I'm going back upstairs.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
HUEY:
Granddad,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
A monkey in lipstick and a wig.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
You gotta stand up to him.
I remember when I was young,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh. Whoa, looks like he could have used

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh, excuse you, little lady.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Tom is possessed
by an evil spirit

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
you can always leave.

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
Oh, Daddy. Hey there, Trudy.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm gonna put an end
to this...

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Tom.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
GRANDDAD:
No! I said, no.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
there was one bully, big dude.
I forget his name.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
a little help on that one.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
What? We's Ninth Ward Negroes.
Survivors.

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
Hey! That's my suit you just--
Went in my personal space.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Y'all gonna get a time-out.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Tom, when we first
let you stay here,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Everybody is in time-out
right now.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or die trying.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
and just tried to kill us.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
LUNA:
I found him.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Again? Enough of--

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
Granddad,
this is childish.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
I said I pulled
into the garage at --

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Lives are at stake.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
He's in a park with another man.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Anyway, he used
to pick on anybody.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Don't think 'cause
I'm on  Larry King Live

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Man, you ever notice how white
people sound when they get mad?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
HUEY: And so did this movie.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
we thought it was only
gonna be temporary. But damn.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Steal your bike,
your chain.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Riley, stop!

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
We used to going without.
Mm-hm.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
WOMAN: Ooh, see. What did I tell you?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
It's okay, I got it, I got it.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I won't whup
your little asses.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
And one day,
I had enough.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Hey there, Huey.
Just me again. Ha, ha.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Fortunately, I thought of a way to do both.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Tom, I just don't see
any end in sight.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
See? That's exactly why I don't have a man.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Check it out, check it out.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
GRANDDAD:
Oops. There go the lights.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
That's very funny stuff.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
"I've had it. Everyone's

13:33.000 --> 13:36.000
getting a time-out."

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
You know you done
fucked up, right?

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
And I confronted him.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It's shine time, folks, but all that glitters is--

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Is, um, your Granddad around?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
We have a wonderful cast,

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It's only been
two days.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
No, I said-- Wait a minute.
I told you I pulled into...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Coming.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
Because all these niggas is gay.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
And I had a gun. But you know what?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
HUEY: And so the gauntlet was thrown

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
in the battle

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
I didn't want to use my gun.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
and they work so very hard every day,

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Nigga, hush. You're living
under my roof now.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
No. They're just
playing checkers.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
TOM:
You're not even looking

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
at the basket.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
of the selfish versus the lazy.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
He's still at the store,
Mr. DuBois.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Move, nigga.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Back in my day, we fought with our hands.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Still?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
MAN:
They do, they do. They do

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
sound like that, don't they?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Where you going?
They're looking for us.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
You're gonna get
some help.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
But without Riley talking, the cops had nothing,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Ooh. What, girl? How his friend look?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
He made that a whole lot harder than needed.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
JERICHA:
Somebody pay the light bill.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and the writers give us fantastic material.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You know what?
I know a great therapist.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Deebo, that was his name. Deebo. Big, old, ugly dude.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
He sounded like that.
Ha-ha-ha.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Huey, come back.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Black women just crazy.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
And in his face.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Uh-huh? Oh, really?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
So now, about this incident.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I'll make an appointment
today.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
and Riley wasn't talking.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
It's all that stuff
they do to their hair.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Score is 16-8.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
Okay.
I guess I'll just, um...

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
What incident you talking about?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Hey, Massa, Dienda send
a message for you.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That...

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
And -- And I had a friend named Smokey.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Riley, please.
Stop the showboating.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
NIQUE:
Damn.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, this is crazy.
Colored folks are something.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
also would have been
a good idea, but...

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
RILEY: I know y'all seen niggas
with spinning rims, right?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
Straighteners and relaxers
and activators and tight braids.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
And then I grabbed myself a brick --

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
I don't know anyone
named Dienda. Dienda who?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Well, hello, cutie pie.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
How am I gonna be a superstar
without a highlight reel?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
JERICHA:
Son, I can't take

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
this kind of heat.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
Yeah.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
But check it,
check it, check it.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Snitch.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Granddad, you didn't live that.
That's from that movie,  Friday.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh, right. Oh, Larry, Larry.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
we've already paid
Mr. A Pimp Named Slickback

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Still look like a ape with a pretty head of hair.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Don't worry, we still ahead.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
NIQUE:
Hotter than the devil pissin'.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Dienda my dick, nigga.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I'm sayin',
on a bike, though.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
Game on. Scared to tell you, folks,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
JERICHA:
I'm just too old for this.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
MAN:
Man, I'm having

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
the best time ever.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Well, hello.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Oh, yeah.
Heh-heh-heh.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
You got to feel me on this, man.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a retainer of $2500.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
And then, like, when I pop a
wheelie. Know what I mean?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
I don't think his friend
likes the sisters too much.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
there's more than one person in the word "team,"

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
HUEY:  My plan was to get to the projector room

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Well, the lesson
is still the same.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I can't even tell you what

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Robert, you shouldn't have.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
And that front wheel
be up off the ground,

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
WOMAN: Ha! Heh. Oh-- Oh!

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Isn't that a surprise?

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
if that makes any sense.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.000
Look at all
the Spanish women.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Now, I have put up with this
for long enough.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and destroy the print of  Soul Plane.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
Uh, wait,
what was the question?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
No, Riley, no!

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
these brothers have suffered through this past week.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
With your credit card.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
it keeps spinnin'.
Ooh, boy!

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
I'm not gonna put up with it
anymore. Get to work now!

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
This kid sure can dribble, but he shoots like shit.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh, yes, brothers.
This is a great victory.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Uh, sorry
about earlier.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
That's exactly why I don't have a man now.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
GRANDDAD:

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
HUEY: Riley made several more

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
attempts to leave the house.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
Man, niggas...
Somebody get me out of here.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Shh.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
BOY:
Dude, that is really sweet.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
Did you know

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
that scientists now believe

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I was rushing, and--

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
Well, I was really hoping

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
That's like
a sweet piece of --

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
Nothing. Absolute pure air, folks.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
I didn't get a chance to talk.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
Oh, I think men who are
comfortable with their bodies

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I had a funny anecdote
and everything.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Heh-heh.
They just mad...

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
it would work out with this one.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Okay.
All right, here we go.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Now, I'm-- I'm sorry I had
to speak at you so sternly,

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
First, I had to go to the bathroom.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
that some people
are actually born

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Me too, baby.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
RILEY: Hey. Bitch Magnus.
BOY #2: Uh-oh.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
It's good.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
They feeling the heat right
about now. I'm telling you.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
with a genetic
predisposition

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Before I shoot
this fucking kid.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
are very sexy,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Riley has gone from sugar

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
Oh, well. At least I got that
crazy bitch out of my house.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
What did you call me?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Now, this don't make no sense.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
I stayed up all night
practicing that anecdote.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
RILEY:
I be like, ugh! Ugh!

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
I called you a bitch,
'cause you's a bitch.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
to absolute crap in no time at all.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
What? Hey, hey, hey.
Quit playing, nigga.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
but you brought it
on yourself.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
to bitch
dependency, Tom?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
especially men
with big round bellies.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
One problem black people have with snitching

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Yeah. Soul, nigga. Uh.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
What, you thought
I wouldn't come see you?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Huey. Huey, quit playing.
Quit it. Huey.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
Next time, I talk first.
Oh, nigga, shush.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And exactly when did you become
a relationship counselor?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
WOMAN: Ooh, what happened, girl?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
What did he say?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jazmine, you're missing
all the best parts.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
is that the police don't necessarily protect

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
You thought you wouldn't
go get the taste

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, it's like I said before:

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Now, stop that!
Slave masters have feelings too.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, sharing
this pimp knowledge

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Really?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
He told his friend I'm crazy.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
smacked out of your mouth

14:10.000 --> 14:10.000
Ah.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
LARRY KING: We're back with my guest,

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
columnist Ann Coulter.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm not watching
a stolen movie.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
those that come forward.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
And I like to cook,
mostly pork.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
for trying to jack
young Reezy?

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
the defense for the Ball-a-Holics

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
for an exorbitant fee
is my way of giving

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
Take the case of Bernard Jefferson,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
just isn't there.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I just don't understand.
I try so hard with y'all.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, well.
If you don't wanna laugh.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
He said, "Luna was crazy."

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
You better fall back,
nigga.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
What?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
So, Ann, what do you make of this

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
something back
to the community, Tom.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
who helped the police shut down a local crack house.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Over to Riley,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Eventually, he had to be forcibly restrained.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
whole N-word controversy in Woodcrest?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I like to clean too.
Wow.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
Mm...

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
You can't beat me.
I'm Butch Magnus.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
he takes the last shot of the game...

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I want to help you,
Tom. I do.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
-Hey, you did the right thing.
-So, um, do you think

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Man, this is so wrong.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
Man, I says we murder
that cracker.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.
What's so funny?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You're not a man, are you?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
You know what you should do?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Up and in.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I think it's criminal they suspended this teacher.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
But I need you to
help me...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
Kidnap and torture his ass. How about that?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
You real good when
you come out of nowhere

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Yeah.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Hey, let's roll by the house
and see if they left yet.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, nothing. Hilarity
just ensued, that's all.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I might need some protection
or something?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
See? I told you I could do it.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't know.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
He going around calling people crazy?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
and sucker punch a nigga.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Well, Riley seems happy,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
Heh. Why? Ha-ha. I mean, be--

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
It did?

14:21.000 --> 14:21.000
help you.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, that's more
the feds' thing.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Why don't you fight
a nigga straight up?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Maybe it wouldn't kill y'all
to do a little bit of work.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Huh.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Oh, we gonna show that nigga just who crazy.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
but apparently for no good reason.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Hey.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
Because he stood up to some foul-mouthed gang member?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
"Help me help you."
Yeah, okay.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Uh, you'll be fine.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Huh?

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
You see anything weird,
you just give us a call,

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
What's wrongs
with you, nigga?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh. Oh. Oh!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Now...tell me, if you would,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Robert Freeman!

14:25.000 --> 14:26.000
HUEY AND RILEY:
"Gang member"?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
We got this slavery shit hooked
up just likes we like it.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
all right, buddy?
Heh. Okay.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Granddad.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
The scoreboard tells the tale.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
They should be giving him a medal.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That was funny.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
about this bitch you have
an unhealthy dependency on.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And you wants to fuck it up
with work?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Darling, all the women
of my cultu--

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Heh. Give me a break.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
MAN: Hey, Bernard!
You snitch-ass motherfucker!

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Now, looks,
before we kills Massa,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Hm? Ah.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Could we please
not call her a bi-- Bi--?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
STINKMEANER:
Come here and fight like a man,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
you bad nigga!

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
It's about time someone in the classroom had the guts

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Granddad,
you home?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I had no idea how we were gonna last until Granddad came home.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
we gotta get
this nigga Catcha Freeman.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
to not back down to thugs like that. Heh.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Say it. "Bitch." Yeah.
Bitch.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Who is that?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Huey?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Uh, yes, we've gotta
call her that, Tom.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
MAN: Shut the fuck up!
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I don't hear anything.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yo, that was crazy.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Hey. Where's Granddad?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Assuming he ever came back at all.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
Even if we could escape,
Catcha come get us.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
RUCKUS:
It's about impossible

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to find his black ass

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
GRANDDAD:
How is the TV back on?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And the lights?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
I mean, 'cau-- You know?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm sorry.
After what she's done,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Bernard lived, but when he refused

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
STINKMEANER:
I know you hear me, Robert!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
What in the hell was that?
Was that about me?

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't like losing.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
Did she just call me a thug?
She sure did.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
in this dark theater.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
He's not here.
I'll call his cell.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
But Catcha Freeman stronger
and faster than us, Percy.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
not callin' her a bitch
would be disrespectful to you.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
I know you hear me!
Ain't this a bitch.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Man, tell me you didn't
think that was hot.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
What's going on here? Hey.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
He's probably having the time of his life.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo. I think we need
to shake the spizzot.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
to identify the men who shot him,

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Well, then,
stop beating yourself.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yeah.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
How's we gonna do that?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
I will not be ignored!
Got a possessed nigga here,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
His phone's dead.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
MAN:
Oh, my God-- Oh, no.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
Don't take your top off.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Huh? What?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
And I'm not able
to do that.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
he was charged with conspiracy

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Oh, wait, wait.
Let me guess.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
We'll use Thelma,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Now please continue,
Tom.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
and Granddad's
worried about a date.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
You gonna hate on it

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Huey?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
And the best part is,
this don't cost you a dime.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
that high-yellow
mulatto jezebel hussy.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
and sentenced to a month in jail.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
BOY:
Yeah. Ha-ha.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yeah?

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Oh, that Ann Coulter sure pulled your card, didn't she?

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, my wife, Sarah--

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
just 'cause they was
talkin' about you.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
You still a bitch.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Tom. You didn't.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
GRANDDAD: Can't believe
these little, young kids

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Get off me!
You got a date, Robert?!

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
You need to stop with
the hate crimes, granddad.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Yeah, you didn't see
that coming, did you?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I sure did.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
GRANDDAD: Hey, that's my great-

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
great-great-great-

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean-- She's the best
woman in the world.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Now, that is one sharp, sexy, white woman.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Forget Jazmine. Let's go.
But we couldn't.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
out their damn mind.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
When your cousin told
everyone in the neighborhood

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
great-great-great- great-grandmother.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Did you tell her that you got
two sets of genitals?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
That wasn't even me.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
ANNOUNCER: And at shooting guard,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
HUEY: We ran out of food and drink.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
She the weak link.
She'll slow us down.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
Boy, get upstairs
and go to your room.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
That was that nigga
from  Friday,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Don't worry, boys.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
how broke you were,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
She look just like Helen of Troy.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We've had a great life
together until now.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
dressed like me.
I'll sue.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
I just want to have
a friendly chat

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
well, I decided
it was time to do my part.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
I don't care how big her Adam apple is,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
RUCKUS: No need to get emotional,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Robert,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, how could we?
Look, she a little girl.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
I'm gonna take me a nap,

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
A vagina and a coochie.
Oh, that's a conjunction.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
You might wanna go over there
and talk to them

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
she's currently the league high-scorer.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I was forced to start rationing what little we had left.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
gonna drink me a Red Bull,
then I'm gonna wake up

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
with your grandfather
about honesty.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I want your family
here in Woodcrest

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
I'm just reciting the historical record.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
before this gets outta hand.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
Did you see that?
I hit that fool like --

14:53.000 --> 15:01.000
The Blond Bomber,
Cindy "Fearsome" McPhearson.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
More and more,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
she's still all woman.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
They're not gonna give her
no real time.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
and beat you till
you decide to talk!

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
You know what? Fuck them.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
HUEY:
No. Luna.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
for as long
as they want to stay.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Anyway, the great- great-great-

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
She do what?
A couple months, tops.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
BOY: Yeah!

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
I started to hate Riley for driving Granddad away.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
This is terrible.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I did everything I could,
but if Riley doesn't talk,

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
What is going on?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
They can make all the silly
little videos they want.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I told you we should have
shot that bitch.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
We're losing the P.R. war.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
great-hussy in question was Thelma.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But we both got priors.
We gots to go.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
BUTCH:
You gonna beat Butch? Come on.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Oh-- Oh, that?
That's just the television.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
When the council vote
on my complaint,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Relax, brother.
It's all part of the plan.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
She was once again showing her disrespect

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
they're both
gonna be charged tomorrow.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
She's gone

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
MAN:
Get outta here. Go next door--

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Psych. Come on in.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Come on, Granddad.
We running out of time.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Boys, turn
the television down!

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
they'll be out of
the neighborhood.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
for her kindly Massa by running away.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Looking at the white girl
is a foul.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
And it's right on time.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sometimes,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
STINKMEANER:
This ain't no TV show, nigga.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
This is real talk, nigga.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Dang, granddad. Heh.

15:02.000 --> 15:05.000
Speaking to the white girl
is a technical foul.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Yes, she is

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
Oh, it'll be great.
The more the merrier.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
I'm joined via satellite
by best-selling author

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
in order to save the day,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
I always knew
you was a hater,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Hurricane.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
people have to sacrifice
themselves,

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
And touching the white girl,
ho-ho, now, that's a lynching.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
HUEY: He was always watching.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
What the hell is wrong with you?
This ain't a movie, Riley.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
but I never thought
you'd be famous for it.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
So we gotta evacuate.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
and columnist Ann Coulter,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Get your hands off me!

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
you know what
I'm saying?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
My friends warned me that there
were weirdoes on MySpace.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
It'll be here any second. Hurry.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Always waiting for me to make a mistake.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
author of  Fucking
Camel Jockeys

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Ow. Ah.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
You and Granddad
about to go to jail.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
Get in your car and drive far,
far away. Quick.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
I rarely slept.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
and The Liberals
Who Smell Like Them.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I can't snitch.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
GRANDDAD:
Wait, no. That's just the TV.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Game on.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
I'm also joined by Reverend Rollo Goodlove,

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You're so brave

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
This person stole
from your family!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
It's not the fact
that you obviously have a man

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
TOM:
Goodbye, Thugnificent.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
MAN:
Man, more women?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
That night, they devised their diabolical scheme

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
to sacrifice yourself
to save us.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
I'm tapping out.

15:13.000 --> 15:13.000
Uh-oh.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Let's get out of here quick.
Y'all go first.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
star of the upcoming BET sitcom,  My Dad Rollo,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
I tried to stop 'em!

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
Uh-- I'm-- I'm tapping...

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Don't get picked by a girl, now.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
possessed by an evil spirit
strapped to a bed upstairs.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Tom.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I don't think you want that,
that ain't pretty.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Get the baby, come on.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
to kill kind, old Massa.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Not me, bitch. You.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah. Hey.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh! Wait! Oh. Oh.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and author of the book
Real Spit From Rollo.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's not?
No.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
Oh, uh-- heh-heh.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
Shh.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
Fearsome takes the ball,

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
JERICHO:
This is not a drill.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
It's the fact
that you lied about it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Hey, Robert.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Just go to sleep.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And finally, by Robert Freeman and his grandchildren.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
M-May I sit down
over there next to Riley?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
You had enough?
You had enough of Butch?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
she goes past him and an easy lay-up.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
It sounds to me, Tom,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
But, Tom, you filed
the complaint with me.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
I wanna start with Ann--
GRANDDAD:  Excuse me.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Huh?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Ooh, in one,
volume six right there.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
like some of
the passion

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Yeah. Then I thought
about it,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Ha!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I, uh, also have a book. It's not out yet.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
has gone out of
your marriage.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
What are you guys
talking about?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
STINKMEANER:
You better leave.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
and I just went over there
and met the guys.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
You might wanna cop that, bro.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
I actually just started writing it,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Hey. Hold this.
We be right back.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And perhaps you're not providing
enough excitement for her.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Is that all
you've got?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
Dag, that was easy.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
: You've reached

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
the national headquarters

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
And turns out
they're not so bad.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
It's like these guys are playing from the exact same--

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
JERICHO:
Hey. Hey, Robert.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
but I do have a cover. So I put it on another book.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Are you talking about
who's doing the break-ins?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Why did you lie to me, Robert?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Little bitch.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
THELMA:
Catcha!

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It's a normal thing
in long-term relationships.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
A little country,
maybe, you know.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Ooh, a fake pass behind his head,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
So here's what it's gonna look like:

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
Come quick to the stables!

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
of the Catholic Church.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
You're just like the others.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
You gonna give me
my chain back.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
When you come up,

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
If you know, you can tell  me.
I won't tell anybody.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
No one is available to take your call.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
goes around to the right side, up and good.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
use the special
escape route I created.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
It's called,
They Called Me Nigger:

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
RILEY: Oh, no, don't go

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
in there, Catcha.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Exactly. See,
what Marx is saying

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And you can
help me fix it?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
If you would like to report sexual abuse--

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
They use the word "thar"
instead of "there."

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Uh, what lie?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
HUEY: I soon forgot which one

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
of us was the prisoner.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
You know what lie.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
You're just mad
because I'm styling on you.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What special escape route?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
One Family's Struggle
for Justice and Freedom.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
is that the oppression
of the proletariat

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Hell no. I'm gonna help you
make that bitch behave.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
But, Tom. I thought
we were in this together.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Catcha don't see nothing.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Damn, there's got to be somebody
we can call for an exorcism.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Oh, you mean the Fidel Castro,
Jay-Z birthday party lie?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And it's written by me,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
is an essential facet
of the exploitation

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
She wants excitement, she can
take her ass to the movies.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Jazmine, are you
wearing a wire?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Yeah.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
STINKMEANER:
You is a bitch!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Looks like we have a match-up like we haven't seen

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
and about me, and it's very inspirational.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
RUCKUS: Now, Catcha had never known

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
inherent in the system.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
I know.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Look, everybody lies.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
So therefore,
due to the class --

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
JAZMINE:
Code blue, code blue!

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
in quite a while. Step up, opens up and straight in.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
So when it comes out, remember that you saw this and buy it.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
the pleasures of the flesh before,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Me, too.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I love it when people lie to me.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
and he was no match for the temptations of Thelma,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
What the hell is this,
a snitch-athon?

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I don't know what I'm gonna charge yet.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
It means they care enough
to spare my feelings.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Riley's got some pepper of his own out there, folks.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
MAN:
More bitches.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
Hey, call me Mr. Bitches.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Man, there's snitches
everywhere.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I heard you tell your friend
I was crazy.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I might charge 20, $25.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
who in the darkness of night

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Well, you were looking for hate.
Way to go.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Tossing it up and in.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You little
half-and-half.

15:46.000 --> 15:50.000
They under the bed, too?
How about the closet?

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
This is...
really uncomfortable,

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
looked even less African than she actually was.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Didn't know I'd be playing
with a baby.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Anyway, TiVo this, if you have the TiVo,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Is that what you think?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Shut up, punk.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
so I'm just gonna
mosey.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
You think I'm crazy?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Instead of being
Mr. Funny Nigga,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
You can come down, little baby.
Ain't no hurricane.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
and play it back when the book come out

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
THELMA:
Oh, yes, Catcha.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Did you know that at least
75 percent of bitches

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Is that why you wanted me
to leave?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
why don't you try being

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Mr. Help-A-Nigga-Go-
Get-His-Chain-Back?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
to remind yourself to go buy it.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Catcha and Thelma rolled around

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
Hey there, boys.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
May white God bless you,
Robert.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Bottles.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
You don't want us here, do you?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
suffer from some kind
of hearing loss?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Mm-hm.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Uh...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Man, I gotta find
a way to get it

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Uh, thank you.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
in a hot, sweaty, naked embrace,

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
I came as fast as I could.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
before Thugnificent finds out.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Hello?
Hey, boy.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay. I wanna start with Ann.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
This alarming statistic
means that more likely than not,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Sure, go home right now.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
It's okay. I don't really
want to be here.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
making passionate jungle love.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Ooh, this is
uncomfortable.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Do not lie to me!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Riley,
let the chain go.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Hey, Granddad.
Uh, how's the trip?

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
HUEY: And so Ann Coulter and Rollo

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Goodlove argued on TV.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So this is the plan...
Uncle Ruckus.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Thugnificent wants it back,
he can handle it.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Goes around with two defenders on her--

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
I wanna go home.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
GRANDDAD: Lies! All lies!

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Thelma Freeman was a saint.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
HUEY: Oh, man.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
talking isn't
the most effective way

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
But Daddy says white people
are building hotels there now.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
You ready to come home?

15:59.000 --> 16:02.000
RUCKUS:
Let's get this party started.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
LUNA:
Hello?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Then he'll think I'm a punk
and kick me out the crew.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
There's a reason they call her Fearsome,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Are you kidding?
I'm having a great time.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. What a surprise.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Thelma was a hussy jezebel temptress!

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
to communicate
with a bitch.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
ED: See, I'm what
they call "techno-savvy."

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Hello?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
WOMAN: You got him, girl?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
It's just rocks and metal.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Not because her dad

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
So we have to stay here.
Why here? Why me?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Whoo! Heh-heh-heh.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
He's in there.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That's when you
have to hit her.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
STINKMEANER:

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yo, this X.
Who's this?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
Yeah. I got him.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Hey, little girl,
stop tickling me.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Here we go again with affirmative action.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Now let me finish the story.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
You got bad credit, Robert!

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Uh, hey, there.
This is, uh, Granddad.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
Now, remember, none of this was your fault.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
It's only worth what you're
willing to give up for it.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
was a bear.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Whoa. What?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
I fucks with the future.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Riley,
you've got to calm down.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Because Daddy says

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I'm talking to my grandson.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
Let's have a different set of rules for blacks...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What--? What happened
to my--?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You tell her what
you want her to do.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
RUCKUS:
Removing an evil-nigga spirit

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
from a Negro is

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Is it worth getting hurt again?
Yeah.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You're letting her mess
with your head.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
you're really, really,
really, really rich.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Doing it big.
So how's the house?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
As Catcha lay passed out,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, the problem is,
we don't live in the future, Ed.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Uh, you did some work
on my car?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
This man took your weekend from you.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
If she say, "No,"
hit the bitch. Simple.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Going to jail?
Yeah.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
I know, you right,
you right.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
Great.
We're fine, no problems.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
after expending his manly seed...

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
We live in the present.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
as hard as removing the stank
from a hunk of shit.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
You talking about the granddad
from the Thugnificent song?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Two days you'll never get back.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
I'm gonna be cool,
I'm gonna be cool.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
Okay, it's just that--
I'm not rich. At all.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
...so this little hoodlum can say the N-word--

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But I-- I couldn't
hit Sarah.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And in the present,
that shit looks ridiculous.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
Getting killed?
Yes, sir.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.000
Mm?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
You gotta kill him.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Kissing a man?
Yeah, yeah. Oh, no.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
Got him. Got him. Got him.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Okay,
guess there's no need of me

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Now, wait a minute.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I couldn't hit
any woman.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
It's not a cybernetic ear. It's
a fuckin' cellphone headset.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
We must use these tools
that the great God

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Oh-ho, shit.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I live on a fixed income.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I take offense at your description of Riley

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Has not hittin' a bitch
been working?

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
Man, that's my shit right there.
Man, I love that song.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
I can't afford
to support everybody.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
rushing home early
or anything, huh?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
He's right there!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
The only thing you gonna do
with it is call a bitch.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
has given us
to fight niggas.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Whoa. Kissing a man?
I mean, if it feels natural,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
Which is great for me,
'cause I'm doing it big.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
CATCHA:
No!

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
As she goes around him once again, Riley, defending--

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Come, now, Robert. I told you
I'm gonna take care of you

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
as a hoodlum, Ann. I don't appreciate it.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean,
scientifically speaking,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And unless the bitch
is a Martian,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
A whip, a noose,
a nightstick, a branding iron.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
This is a wonderful child. This teacher,

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Thelma trick Catcha.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
has not hittin' the bitch
achieved the desired results?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
They roasted you.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
and that's what
you're into --

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
So, what's new? What you mad at this week?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey!

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
there ain't no explanation for
the shit to look that high-tech.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Man, how'd it go?
How'd that go?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
No, that don't count.
That's a do-over.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Ooh, a little finger roll there.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
when the FEMA check comes.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
because he's white,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
'cause your ass is old

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Foul, foul.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
JERICHA: Praise Jesus.
What if the check doesn't come?

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Hey, uh, Granddad,
I gotta go.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
...the darkies attacked!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
No way. I just--

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
I didn't know you was
gonna say that.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
because of his skin, he's being persecuted

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Colonel Massa's men fought bravely,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Have you seen that shit
in the mirror?

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
These things strike fear
into a nigga's heart.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
It's Tom.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Guess you really want
that chain back.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Keep your hand
off that white girl.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
MAN:
Wait, what's Spanish

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
for breasts?

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I-- I-I can't. I-- I couldn't.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
Man, they killed you.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
You need to think about
getting a full-time job.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
for saying the exact same word.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
but they were outnumbered and unprepared

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
You look like you're going to
a fuckin' comic-book convention.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, see, that's
actually why I'm calling.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
No. The answer is no!

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
Foul.
Oh, come on, man,

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
I mean, I think that is racist.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Tom.
I won't.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
A job application.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Right on time.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Full-time job?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
for the savagery of the Negro assault.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Tom, Take a deep breath.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
-This the house?
-Yeah, man, this the house.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
that's some old bullshit.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Trying to get this check
from FEMA is a full-time job.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Heh-heh, you know?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It's okay. People have phobias.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Avoid conversation
with the nigga.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
See, I'm gonna make
my own rap

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Tom. Tom.
Hey, Tom.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
Hell no, I don't
agree with Huey.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
STINKMEANER:
You ain't right, Robert.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
about Thugnificent
and embarrass him.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Don't let nobody
take nothing from you, boy.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
That's a technical foul.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
A full-time job
is a full-time job.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
HUEY: Nothing much was resolved,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
but they did it again.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GUARD: Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Some niggas can't
cross bridges,

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
RUCKUS:
The nigga will lie.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
The nigga will make excuses.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Hey, yo. You never gonna
guess who on the phone.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Oh, one more of those and Young Reezy is out of here.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Hold up, hold up.
I'm getting a call.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Shoot, I remember back
when I let a friend

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
Waiting on FEMA
is what got you into this mess

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
You going in the closet.
Let me go!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
you can't go upside
a bitch's head.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
borrow my copy
of Al Green's  Live in Tokyo.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
Next, they'll be throwing white kids in jail

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
MAN:
Fuck you, you massa!

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Yeah.
What's good, baby?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
He will use words
he don't really know.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
And did you know that fool
parked cars on my yard?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Come on, ref,
that's some kind of bull.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
in the first place.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Hey! Hey, man,
let me out of here.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, you ain't
getting out of here.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay. We can beat this.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
LUNA:
Either of you make a sound,

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh, so we just
lazy refugees, huh?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
for reciting rap lyrics.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm gonna rap
about that, too.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
He never gave it back to me.
Then when I asked for it,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
You need glasses out there?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
Hey! I'm closet-phobic.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
I mean-- Uh-- Uh--

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Tom, this is
my bottom bitch,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Ed, ain't that one of your
grandfather's alarm systems?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
If he gets really desperate,
he may start to rap or dance.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
So, uh, XYZ, uh, whatever
your name is,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
I will butt-rape
your grandfather

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
You know what?
You boojie.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
I bash youse head in.
MAN 2: We gonna get you.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
with this broomstick.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Score is 24-30.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Where does it stop? This is preposterous.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
GRANDDAD:
Boys, don't make any noise. Shh.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
he said
he didn't have it.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
We can still win this.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
You don't remember struggle.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
You better read  The Secret.
HUEY:  And again.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Sweetest Taboo.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
-ED: Nah.
-Nigga, you sure?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
I was wondering
if you would be interested

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Well, I knew he was lying,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
Tomorrow, either you
get a job or get out.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
Only one darky, Tobias, had the decency

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Now, she's gonna
help you learn how to

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
It says, "Wuncler Security."

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
STINKMEANER:
You all, uh, testicles

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
and no shaft.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
in rapping with me
on this song?

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Man, we can't beat 'em.
Not while she in the game.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Oh, okay. Here's a novel idea:

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
but he would never let me
back into his house after that.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Him too.
Oh, man.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
reestablish dominance
at home.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
See, I'll rap first, and you can
come in and rap second.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
You gonna have to get in her
head the way she's in yours.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
I think if black people don't wanna be called the N-word,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
I ain't seen
no naked pictures, girl.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Oh, hi. Ha-ha.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
The women and kids can stay,

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
to try and stop this madness.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
Send them to my Sidekick.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Ah, yeah.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
But no curse words.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
You must be Robert's
weekend visitor, Luna.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
I gotta bag on her.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Hello. Heh.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
What happened
to your shaft?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Well, one day, he wins

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
but you two lazy
niggas got to go.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
they shouldn't call themselves the N-word.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Wait a minute, y'all.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Taboo will be playing
the role of your wife.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Damn it, Ed, get off
that fucking phone!

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
And none of them crazy metaphors --

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
this all-expense-paid trip to Hawaii.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.000
That's a great idea.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
How's we's gonna survive
without Massa?

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
There's powerful niggadry
at work here.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
"Your breasts look like two mountains."

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
I'm Tom. May I speak to
Robert or the boys, please?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Whoa, whoa,
are you guys talking about

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Now, approach
Taboo,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
I think we in the wr...

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The only grown-ass man
in this house not working

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Just like if they don't want the police to pull them over,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
We can't do this,
it ain't right.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
None of that garbage. Just stick to the point.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
And after he left, that's when I made my move.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
insulting that child
to throw her game off?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
I know where he is.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
grab her arm
firmly

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
They're not in. I'll
tell them you stopped by.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
is gonna be me.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
I'm not stupid.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
RUCKUS: Ah...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and command her
to leave with you.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Who's there, huh?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Who in the hell are you?!

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
He went on the
"do it big" trip without me.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
they shouldn't be driving stolen cars.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
It ain't right.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
...wrong house.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Can you turn me up
in the headphones?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Can I, um,
use the bathroom?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
How dare you?

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
Nigga, my name is Reverend
Father Uncle Ruckus.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
I knew it.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
He's off having
the time of his life.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Thank you, Tobias.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Sarah,
get your behind--

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Granddad, you're only
making things much, much worse.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Wow. That is so gangster.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
What's that?

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
How many of
these damn TV shows

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
I want you to know, you've
always been like a son to me.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
There something wrong
with your bathroom?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Just something to help
get you going.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Granddad is running errands,
Mr. DuBois.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I been waiting
on this day

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Stop, stop. Say "bitch."

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Um, this might seem strange,

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Oh, how about,
her breath is so stank

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
are we supposed to do,
Goodlove?

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.
Motherfucker done shot me.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
No relation.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Oh, hush, boy. I can rap.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
You ran up into his crib?
Sure did.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
I don't need your charity.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Barring an unforeseen
catastrophe,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Except I would never, ever lay

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
since your little uppity ass
came into town.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
In the name
of white Jesus

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
that, um, it smells
like hot garbage?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Have they called you
about that money?

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
Man.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Do I have to call her
a bitch, really?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
and all great white men
who have come thereafter,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Big Tank, please
make it hot, player.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
but, uh, heh, do you think maybe

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
But you wanna know
the brilliant

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Say something about her mama.
Like, her head's so big,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
I'll pay you back when
my FEMA check arrives.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
he'll be home soon.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
with your black
jungle-bunny mama.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Yes, Tom. You have to
call her a bitch.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
I can come in
and inspect the house?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.000
part of this story?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
He better, 'cause I'm angry.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Not since you asked me
about 20 minutes ago, Robert.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
He didn't win no
all-expense-paid trip to Hawaii.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Oh, Massa.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
GRANDDAD: I don't get it.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
I command thy black nigga soul
back to the depths of hell.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Yeah, this rap go out
to Punknificent

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Inspect the house.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
she use a fitted sheet
for a stocking cap.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
Yeah, whatever. Beat it.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
Well, don't you think
we should have heard something?

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Trust me
on this one.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You guys got elephant dollars.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Oh, jeez.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
That's right, Bob.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
You ready to come out?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Kills them both.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I've done the research.
Now, try again.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Wait, wait, wait.
Your mama's so black,

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
It seems as though

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Why your dumbass
robbing people?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and all his fans.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, ha, this is awkward,
but, um, how do I do this? Okay.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I bought those tickets myself.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
COULTER:
I don't care.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
'Cause I'm an American.
Shit.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Nice move, Granddad.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
when she get out the car,
the oil light come on.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
this Good Samaritan's
patience has run out.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
MAN:
Baby, baby, listen.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
WZIB News got an anonymous tip
that Robert Freeman,

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
I don't care.
Is that--?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
It's the American way, man.
Shit.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
Uh, it-- It's just that I got an
e-mail from Huey this morning,

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
So you spent, what,
a thousand dollars

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Ah. Now, there she is.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Bitch, get
your behind--

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
never went to high school

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Having known no other woman,

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
You won't kill me, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Where the fuck was you raised?
A third-world country?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
Is that all you got, nigga?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
to retrieve a $20 album?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
I don't think
that's gonna work.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
The gun--

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
Don't give me that "Baby,
listen" shit, motherfucker.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Ass.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, no, nigger.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
and it reads:

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Well, back then it was probably
more like a $5 album,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
who had agreed
to take the family in

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Catcha married Thelma

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
See, as I broke it down
to Ed, pops,

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
All right. How about,
your mama's so fat--

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
and lived a miserable life
as a free man in Boston.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
That's just the tip
of this iceberg.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
mother fool

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
"Dear Tom, my granddad kicked
a woman named Luna--"

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
until their FEMA
relief check arrived,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
You think I'm stupid?
I know you fucking that bitch.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You'll only die trying.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Bitch. Get your ass
in the car.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
if people don't have a need,
then there won't be no demand,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
No, no, no, wait, wait.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
That would be you, heh-heh.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
but I got my album back.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Your mama's so ashy-- No.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
is now kicking them out early.
Brutal.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Read, nigga, read!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Nobody can say they got one over
on your granddaddy.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
Okay? I know you are.
I mean...

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
And that, colored folks,

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Kiss my ass, you little-dick,
faggot motherfucker.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
so we out here creating the
demand, know what I'm sayin'?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
No!

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
"--out, and she may return
and murder the whole family.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Miss Elderberry was talking
about Cindy's mom.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Or, uh, I'm, uh--

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
like Thugnificent

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Who are y'all?
What are y'all doing here?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I-- I don't play that shit.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
is the real story
of Catcha Freeman.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm original O.G.

17:17.000 --> 17:21.000
Ooh, this is good.
This is really gonna get her.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Or...

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
If you was any kind of real man,
I wouldn't be here

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Turns out Ed and Rummy were breaking into homes

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
"Please check on us
periodically this weekend.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
You do whatever it takes, boy.
Whatever it takes.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Why are you throwing children
out into the street?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Ann don't play that shit.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Ruckus, I should kick in
your damn jaw for telling lies.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Or I'm gonna die...

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Whoa!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
with Usher
in the first place!

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
as a way to stimulate sales for Wuncler's security service,

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
"Best regards, Huey Freeman.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Get the hell outta here.
Get that camera out my face.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Say hello to the bad guy.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Rollo.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
trying.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Now, Robert, now.
Just hit him with anything.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
This motherfucker
went YouTube?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
"PS: If she says we're not in,
please ask to search the house.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
What I had heard was...

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Hey, baby.
Hey.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You high-yellow niggas
always forgetting your place.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? What?

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
REPORTER:
Is it true that you hate

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
poor black people?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
You thought you was the only one

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Wait, hold on. I don't think
that's what Sarah would say.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
which was owned by Ed's grandfather.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Oh, come on, Ed,
you gots to help me out.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Give me some sugar.
Come here, girl.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Get the fuck out of my house,
you fat ass, motherfucker.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
who mastered the ancient
and deadly art of the nunchaku?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Come on, everybody join in.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
We may be locked
in our rooms."

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
--with that big ass...

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
ROLLO:
You getting thick

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
back there.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's now tragically
obvious

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's really on now.
Oh, hell no.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Kidnapping? Uh --
I don't know, Riley.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
Is it true? Did Bill Cosby
put you up to this, Mr. Freeman?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Damn you, Riley.
You've ruined our family.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
If you were in my house,
nigga,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
The irony is, Granddad had already signed up

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Use your powerful hands.
This is gonna be funny.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Oh, me and Robert
patched things up.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
--you know--?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
And how you doing, Abdul?
COULTER: Damn, Abdul,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that reasoning
with the bitch

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
This little fucking
bitch-ass, old-ass nigga.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
My grandpops would
be tripping, man.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
You drove Granddad away.
Now he's never coming back.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
I'd burn it down around
your black ass.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
for Wuncler Security.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Yeah, I am so sure
that's true.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
Why don't you, you know,
try something different,

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
Game on.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
I swear to you, Robert,
I didn't call them.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
HUEY:
Excuse me, everyone.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
is not
gonna work, Tom.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Let's whup
this nigga's ass.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Hey, yo,
word to mother--

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Granddad left 'cause of you.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
can you let a bitch work?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You have to
hit her.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
And to add insult to injury, it didn't even work.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Repeat after me
the holy phrase:

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Hello?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
It's just that
he goes on to say:

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
like diplomacy for a change?
Man, just snatch him up,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I would never
do something like that.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Shit, one of us has to.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
I think we can resolve
this quickly.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Oh, boy, you look mad.
I'm scared now.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Nobody likes you, Huey,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
It ain't like yo' ass
is going to get a job. Heh.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I am an assistant district
attorney, for chrissake.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
nigga, get your black ass
outta here.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh, hey, hey,
Mom.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
"PPS: There's absolutely
no chance

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000

you decided to let us stay.

hater, faggy boy.

don't have the chain on him,

You're not gonna cry now,
are you?

You know I had to bail

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
you have to
get past this.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
You know, the cost of
bullets are going up.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000

outta here.

him tell you where it at.

out of jail again, right?

It's okay,
faggot...really.

Your mama got caught
giving up neck

Lynchwater's plantation.

gave you permission.

Come on, Ma. That ain't
even my style, Ma.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
I see.

to do is think.

at the Woodcrest Country Club,

"He was also
Colonel Lynchwater's son,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
This little old
dude, Ma. Just one.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
No, no. We still waiting.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Ah. My chin--
You see that?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
You all right with me.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
"PPPS: Uh, be careful,
she's very danger--"

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
and it wasn't your daddy.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
I'm gonna remember this.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
although the colonel
never claimed him."

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Anyway, Granddad got his car back, and that was that.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Nigga, get your black ass
outta here.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Just think of these
two grapes...

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
What? This game's a real squeaker.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
You know,
as a matter of fact,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
They ain't broke that
bread yet. But, uh, any day now.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Bitch is hittin' you.
All right, lady.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Ma, I really need to
call you back, please.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I might just build
an addition to your house.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
GRANDDAD: Wait? W-what? Massa's son?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Whoa!

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
There goes Riley, up--

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay-- Ow!

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
STINKMEANER:
I'm a-join in too.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
'Cause I do. Mom,
I'm in a meeting.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Oh, for some reason, he left her standing there.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Hey, guys.
So nice to finally meet.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Uh-uh. No, no, no, that can't be.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You're definitely allowed
by law to hit her now, Tom.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
It was a misunderstanding.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
out of here.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
...as your two little
itty-bitty kiddy testicles.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
All on old Cousin Jericho.
How about that, huh?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
It's been great working
wit' y'all.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
HUEY: He is believed to have written

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
the first screenplay,

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's self-defense.
I didn't do anything.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Mommy. Can I call you
back, please, Ma?

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
MASTER: Flawless victory.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
Standing, looking dumbfounded.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I mean,
maybe an indoor pool.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.000
Ooh-wee, your mama does cocaine
when she thinks nobody around.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Okay, I'm reloaded!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Uh. Hello?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Okay?
Sweetest Taboo,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
you are in rare form.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
Hey, Ed, give
your granddaddy my best.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Keep going!

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
Bowling alley,
with Jacuzzis and silk sheets.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
several years before the invention

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
outta here.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Oh, okay,
okay, cool.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Where is the chain?
I don't know!

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
Ah. That bitch must have
lost her mind.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Luna, this has gone
far enough.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
of the motion picture industry.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I will. I'm gonna
call you back, Mommy.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Who told you that?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
I will smack
the black off her.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
RUCKUS: What website is that?

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
Madeupmonkeyshit.com?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
This isn't an exorcism,
it's a beating.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I swear to God!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
How about that, huh?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I love you, too.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Leave Tom out of this.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Uh-oh. Look out.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Conservatory
and a small kitchenette--

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I will snatch
the weave off...

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
This is my state-of-the-art
surveillance center.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
But leave me out of this first.
Let me go.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Don't swear to God.
I talk to God all the time,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Folks, whatever Riley is doing out there, it is working.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
How you like that, fool?

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Catcher fell in love with Thelma,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
They did it.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
There's very little difference.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
HUEY: Granddad had lost this battle,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
That's Ann Coulter?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Why does a pimp need
a surveillance center?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Cheers.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I was falling in love
with you, Robert.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
and God
happens to be the one

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
She crazy as hell,
ain't she?

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
but Thelma wasn't looking for love,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
ALL:
Nigga, get your black ass

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
outta here.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Hey, are we gonna fuck
this old-ass nigga up?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
that told me
to torture your ass,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Your parents
are getting divorced

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
but he had far from surrendered

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
she was looking for freedom.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Here's 50.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Included in
your retainer fee

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
and waiting till after
your birthday to tell.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
the next three months of his life.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
But she good people.
She good people.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah, you niggas ain't shit!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
Now, you know, I don't hate old people.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
You're just like
all the others.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
you lying,
stealing motherfucker.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Boy, I can't wait to tell the white man about how you lying.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is state-of-the-art
bitch surveillance.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah. There's no way.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
--big-screen TV
sitting on top of a TV.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
So this whole time, you guys
have been working together?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Your mothers ain't shit.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
It's just sometimes, you gotta let 'em know

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
What others?
Who are these others?

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
You gonna tell me where
that chain is. I know that.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
Then, on one fateful day--

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Come,  negro-san.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Quiet Storm here
has been monitoring

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Them ain't no negroes!
It couldn't be them.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
not to get it twisted.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Looks like Riley is all up in her head,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
Yeah, silly. I told you
I had it covered.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Where you going?
You smell like black jellybeans.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
your wife's
conversations and e-mails.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
What the fuck
y'all looking at?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Just 'cause you lived a long life,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
HUEY: And so she told them the very,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Ed, can I
talk to you outside?

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
and speaking of being ahead,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
don't mean it can't come to a short end, nigga.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
folks, we're looking at something here.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
I'm confused.
Me too.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Daddy, I've got transcripts
of all her conversations today.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
No charges were filed.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
HUEY: Several hours later,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
the exorcism of Tom DuBois

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
very, very sad story of Luna.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Please.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I thought Ann Coulter
hated...everybody.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
WOMAN: No way.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Look at my face.
Look at it.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Sixty-one, 44.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
No mention of Usher.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
had made no recognizable progress.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Ah, this is bullshit.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm hacking
into her e-mail now,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
ED: Nah, baby.
I-I'm not talking to you.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
What's up, world? This is Sway.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
LUNA: I was raised in a broken

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm gonna crush
your kiddy penis

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Robert,
all the phones are dead.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
Who, Ann? No, man.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That was great, Granddad.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
and abusive household.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
She knew the time for freedom had come.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
but, tsk, this computer
is running a bit slow.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Is the nigga still in him?

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Law-enforcement sources have confirmed

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Bitch, this chicken
is cold.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
with this hammer
when I get back

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Yeah. Can't afford it.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
She just do that to get
that redneck money.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Boy, I wish we could've seen
the end of that movie.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
As long as he's black
and breathing,

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
if you don't tell me
where that chain is at.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Riley, this is it.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
Why does it always have
to end up like this?

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
THELMA:
Once we're in

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
the weapons shed,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
that two Cleveland teens have been arrested

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
Now, Ed.
Oh, no!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Let me tell you
something about Ann.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Perhaps if we didn't
have dial-up.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
he's got nigga in him.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
This is your day.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
What if FEMA
calls about the check?

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
we assault the house
with everything

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I feel bad for leaving Huey
and what's-her-name.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
for assaulting this man while reciting the lyrics

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
When I turned 17, I ran away to Hong Kong,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I always believed in you.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
'Cause you's a bitch.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
When a nigga need a nemesis,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
we can get our hands on.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Bitch, don't start
with that

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Tough titty.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They knew the risks.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Thanks, coach.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
she helps me out,
and I help her back.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Okay, guys, look. Look.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So they might do
a little time.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
"we need another
computer" shit.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Ow!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
to Thugnificent's hit, "Eff Granddad."

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
where I met Triad boss Kenny Woo, my first love.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Well, look at this.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Uh, excuse me,
I have to make a call.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I think you're all missing
a big opportunity

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
You say that shit every time
a new iMac comes out.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
My bike!

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
GHOSTFACE: What the fuck is wrong

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
with you, Huey?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
That's the wrong kid, Ed.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Don't do it.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
COULTER: Mm!
She a down-ass bitch.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
We see 'em when they get out.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Bitch, this chicken
is cold.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
I told you to grab Butch Magnus,
5'4", 130 pounds.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
The Tigers have only one player to sub

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
You taking it too far now,
Robert. Quit playing.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
here with my script.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Uh...it doesn't seem right.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
You retarded? You gonna beat the man's brains in

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
One of the teens reportedly told police,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
and it looks like it's little Billy Mathews.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
I know most of you can't read,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You ain't slick.
You better

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
After that, I had one terrible relationship after another.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
Hey! Hey! Hey,
brother man, get off my phone.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
These crab cakes
are good as a mug.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going back
and turning myself in.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
make that G4 work,
bitch,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
and what you gonna say to the cops?

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
"I beat up old people because Thugnificent does it,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
but I'd be happy
to read it to you.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and stop playin'
with me.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Well, how was I supposed to know
that was the wrong kid?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Now, Billy is autistic but he sure loves basketball.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
I fucks with these
crab cakes.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Turn yourself--?
Man--

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
"Sorry, officer, we killed the nigga

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Catcher, in one week,

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yes, Daddy.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
'cause he had a evil spirit"?

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
and that makes it cool."

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
I suffered every kind of abuse
imaginable. Verbal.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I gave you
a picture, man.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
Getting his first playing time right here today.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
we gonna kill Massa.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Granddad, look, come on.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Ghost, it's late.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
It wasn't the last incident.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
How hard is it to grab
the right kid, Ed?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I'm tearing
these bad boys up. Mm.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I mean, I love Huey.
Almost like a brother.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Nothing in the e-mail.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Someone stole my bike.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
I've had it. I'm about to give
you a Category 5 ass whupping.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
At least let me show it to him
before you kill him.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Does she have
a MySpace page?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
RUMMY: Yo, Riley!

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Can you just tell me what to do,
so I can go to bed?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Recently, a rash of elderly assaults

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
I told you not to wash

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
You told me to grab a kid.
I grabbed a kid.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Son, just go in there
and have fun.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
So are you even
a republican?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But what's done is done.
We got to let go of the past.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
MySpace?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
my bloody ski mask
with detergent

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Oh. Hell, no. You think
I like going out there

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Spinning, baby!

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
I can't believe you haven't figured this shit out yet.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
attributed to the beef have broke out,

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Today's your day.
I always believed in you.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It's just been upgraded
from a Category 3.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
I worked really hard on this.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't think Sarah
would have a--

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Found it.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You don't like the way I do it,
then do your own kidnapping.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You have one week.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
including two in Lithuania and one in Tokyo.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
because it irritates
my fucking eczema!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Get off me.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
and saying this
ridiculous shit? Heh.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If he don't come back,
can I have his side of the room?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Peace.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I want it.
I want it.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Huh.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Ed and Rummy
done stole my bike!

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Spiritual.
Look at you.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
You know what?
That's your only freebie.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
Thank you, Jesus.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Uh, since when did
she have a MySpace page?

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
STINKMEANER:
You got imaginary friends?

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
The AARP announced a boycott of Thugnificent's record label.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Oh, shit. You keep talking,
I'm gonna give you a Category 7.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
So then why do it?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Nobody wants you
but me.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
You want me to kidnap
anybody else,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Ah, come on, Granddad.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Man, niggas,
I can't stand them.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Peace? Peace? Peace.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Robert!

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
'Cause a bitch got books
to sell. That's why.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
Oh, my. You know,
I-I should hang you

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
You know what her password
might be?

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
You ain't shit
without me.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
you're paying top dollar.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Ball's being passed to Billy Mathews,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You supposed to be setting
a better example.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Um. Gosh-golly, we--
We usually use

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
That's not fair.
You grabbed the wrong kid.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Out.
Robert, wait. Robert.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.000
Why? What did I do? I'm fun!

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Ain't no money in trying
to save the world.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Stinkmeaner, you hate
black people, don't you?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
It's feared that the protest

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
You without me
equals shit.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
poor little kid.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
for being able to read
and write.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You just wait till
the manager gets here.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Stole my damn bike.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
could soon explode into more violence.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Tough titty.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
Oh, I'm gonna take it easy
on you, Rain Man.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
What would your momma say if she
knew you was kicking out family?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
WOMAN:
We need Ann in makeup.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
each other's middle names
as passwords,

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Hey, come back
and bring me back my bike.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
You understand that,
you ugly, fat bitch?

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
But this is one heck of a--
Of a-- Uh...

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
I sure do.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Why does everyone think
I'm not fun?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
All I know is they better not
stop this war in Iraq,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He gonna throw the book
at both of y'all.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
so mine would be
Lancaster.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
Man, Thugnificent ain't telling nobody

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
This nigga out here
like Forrest Gump, y'all.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
She'd say, "Get them
broke-ass niggas the fuck out."

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's L-A-N--
Got it.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
GRANDDAD:
What's that, boy?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
I mean, I hate
everyone in general,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
My bad.
You go ahead and leave.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Why am I always
the one getting ditched?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This  is
the worst day...

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
to beat up no old people.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
Now, let me borrow
your car.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
or I might have
to start stripping.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.000
What'd you call it? A script?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Password is "Usher."
Here we go.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
but black people
especially.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't even really see how someone could even

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
What the fuck you looking
all scared for, huh?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
No hope on this, and the ball goes straight up-- And in!

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Nothin'.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
I don't know
why I'm not cool.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
: And in Woodcrest tonight,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
of my entire life.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Message to Usher.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
Where's your bike?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
And-- And, Ruckus,
you hate black people too.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
get something like that outta that song.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
And there was that summer
I dated Jim Brown--

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They're getting together
at 3:00

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Thugnificent is talking about

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I said you was free
to go, right?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
What the--?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Um, Jericho Freeman?

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Tom, you think I went
all the way to Costa Rica

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
the school board has finally decided

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Yes, sir, Massa Colonel.
You got it, a script.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.000
I wouldn't exactly call them
people, but yeah.

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
Which part of "my bad"
do you not understand?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
on the fate of an elementary school teacher

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Told you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
at the Woodcrest
Chateau Hotel.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
what he's going through,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Okay. Okay,
we get it.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
The crowd is loving this kid.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yes?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
and back in two days?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
First one ever made,
right here.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That's in an hour.
We have to go.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
so maybe a young person listening

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
accused of using the N-word.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.000
Well, if you're selling,
I am buying.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Yeah, I have a deep distaste
for Negroids.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
You had a lot of bad
relationships.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Three points plus 44 points
equals 47 points,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Then w-where were you?

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I hope you got some insurance
on those spinners.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
won't have to go through the same shit.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
Oh, so now you wanna
make this

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Here's the guardian
for the kids.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You have to take me!

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
You smell me? You know,

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
people always wanna --

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Maybe you should go
see a therapist.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
a whole big
fucking thing, huh?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
definitely 59 points minus
47 points

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
None of your damn business.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Third-grade teacher Joe Petto was given 10 days unpaid leave

18:59.000 --> 19:04.000
Oh, you are gonna be
a very rich man, son.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's right,
Ruckus.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Tom, if you're not ready
to take control,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Right, right. And, Stinkmeaner,
I bet you hate rap music.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
This isn't my fault.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
We'll do the "do it big" trip
some other time.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We snuck
into the movie, too.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
RUMMY: Wheee!

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
equals 14 points to go.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
This is it. They said
it was gonna take three months,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
then going there won't help.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
If you can call that old

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
My friend Nicole says
it's men like you, Robert,

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, fuck you then.
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Oh, okay. Ahem. Cool.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
and ordered to take sensitivity training.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We?  You said you was gonna
turn  yourself  in.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I say let the bitch go.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
Thank you
for not snitching!

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
stanky-booty
gorilla noise "music."

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
who lie and avoid commitment.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
All right, Billy,
no more freebies.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
but it took shorter time.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
You know what I mean?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Enough, man.
Enough.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
What? Oh, man.
That's some old bullshit.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
Untrue! Falsehood and untrue.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I paid you $2000,
and $500 as well.

19:05.000 --> 19:10.000
If I could just find a man
to love me.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
No, no, man,
I'm sick of this shit.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
That's what I'm talking about.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Please. Let the kids go.
I'll take responsibility.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
ED: You stupid motherfucker!

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Heh-heh. "Stanky-booty."

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
HUEY:

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
A little lucky shot there by Billy Mathews and-- Again.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
JERICHA:
Jesus, Lord and savior.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, by the way, Robert,
I, um--

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
what started as a simple
disagreement between neighbors

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
I'm trying
to squash it, right?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
That's it?
W-what about my money?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
Wait, Dad. There's something
I should tell you about Thelma.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
I must say that's a brilliant
observation, 'Meaner.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
And this bitch-ass
motherfucker's

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
NIQUE: Believe that.
Who makes all checks possible.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
I left some,
um, joke voicemails

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Now, Tom, I hope
you can appreciate

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
still acting like
he hurt and shit.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Look like y'all
all going down.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
has devolved into senseless,
ignorant, self-destructive

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
That right, that right.
We thank you, Jesus.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
that you can just, um--
Heh.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
So, what about Rollo Goodlove's demand

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Having sold his script,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
our no-refunds policy.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
HUEY: I had forgotten,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
a nigga moment

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I ain't even touched
this motherfucker yet.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Catcher promptly betrayed Thelma's rebellion.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
How about a complimentary date
with Sweetest Taboo?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Billy Mathews is incredible.
Yes!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Good times, baby.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
--go ahead and delete. Ha, ha.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
for financial restitution to the Freeman family?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
The manager's
not coming.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
cannot be resolved through violence.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
generational tribalism.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
I ain't even brushed
past you yet.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
RILEY: Oh, man, he sold the crew out

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
for a script?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Cinema's closed
indefinitely.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
I ain't even made eye contact
with your punk ass.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I knew you can do it.
I knew you can, Billy. Yeah.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
"Having reviewed your records,
we have determined

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No, no, no.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But where there's harmony and peace--

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
Fortunately, a robust exchange
of ideas has taken place,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Looks like everyone walked out.
Something about a union.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You're still
on retainer,

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Damn it, Luna.
Stop being a victim.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
You mean we did
all this for nothing?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yo, that's a bitch-ass nigga.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and we're
going now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
What? What's happening?!

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah, come on
over here.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
"that you have not submitted

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
and we are hopeful to having
a resolution shortly.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I lied to get you
out of the house

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
Proof of Non-Residence
Form 3595-768-5."

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Sorry, guys.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Oh, my goodness.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
What?
The manager ain't coming?

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I'll give your bitch ass
something to cry about.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
Boys!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
We tried our best.
You'll get 'em next time.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
And when were they planning
such treachery?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Ohh...

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
No! You tricked me.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
'cause I was afraid you'd
do something like this.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
BOY:
Here you go, Billy.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Thank you.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
LEONA RAY:
What kind of mess is this?

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
Hey, Abdul. I see you over there
talking to that white bitch.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, call the police.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Now the nigga can get
some bass in his voice.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
And look.
I was right.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
What's up, world? This is Sway.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
The ball stolen by Billy Mathews.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
JERICHO:
"Your check could

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
not be processed.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Granddad!
Granddad.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
A week from now.
Mm-hm. Three o'clock.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The FBI.
Homeland Security.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
--a nigga moment cannot exist.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Don't take your past out
on other people.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
A member of the
Lethal Interjection crew

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
He's got angle, he's got aim, he's got game.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
Heh-heh-heh, hey!
Give me a hug.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
You ain't slick.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, bitch. Let's go.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
That's the first step
to a lonely life.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
"Fill out the enclosed form
and your check

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
Wait, wait, wait. That's it?
We don't get nothing?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You mean,
we gonna let

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
He lets me whup him,
we can call it even.

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
was apparently the victim
of a violent robbery

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
this African hooliganism
go unpunished?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
STINKMEANER:
No! You tricked me!

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
What's a nigga want?
Try to whup me.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And what was it
about you

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Billy Mathews, out of nowhere,

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
You came home.
You home early.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
No, you lying black bitch!
That wasn't a week.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
"should be mailed out

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
That's a damn shame
you can call a nigga a nigga

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Whup your ass,
nigga.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
that made you keep dating
those kind of men?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
in the exclusive suburb
of Woodcrest today.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
makes you wish the whole team

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
in the next six months."

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
'Cause I figured y'all was
destroying my house. Hm.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You have problems, Mr. Freeman,
and you need help.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I'm gonna get you eventually,
Robert.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You know who
you messin' with, nigga?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
and keep your job.
That's a damn shame.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
And you can't kidnap people just
because they don't like you.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
The perpetrator,
a local 12-year-old

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
was autistic right now, doesn't it?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
What mess is this? Y'all filled
out wrong forms, or what?

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
Forward! Come on!

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Thanks for coming back...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
You hear me, nigga?!

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
Boy, that kid is special.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Come on, boys,
let's get out of here.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Would somebody here
please be an adult?

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
named Butch Magnus Milosovic
talked to us

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
eventually.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It's not a good look, Luna.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
Why do you hate us, Father?
What have we done to you, Jesus?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Doesn't look too bad.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
We don't need
this shit.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Whoa.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
MAN:
Shoot 'em, shoot 'em!

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Yo, you need to stop
snitching, Granddad.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
You're neighbors.
You have to live together.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
Game goes to the Tigers, 68-61.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Calm down, Robert, now.
We ain't out of this yet.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
Oh, you're right.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
with apparently
no fear of repercussions.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
THUGNIFICENT: Hey, man,
you know what?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Charge!

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Ah. Ow. Hey.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Somebody here
needs to be an adult.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I didn't even wanna
kidnap you.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I just don't know
where we gonna go now.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
How was Costa Rica?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
I can make one phone call,

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
No, Massa, no!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Why don't you call
social services

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
Yeah. You know,
all I'm saying is, you know,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
ALL:
Come on, Billy. Yay! Go!

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Did you do it big?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
and we'll have
two dozen protesters

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and turn yourself in
for child abuse?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
TOM:
There they are.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
We're neighbors.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
I was listening to my stupid
girlfriend, Nicole.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Why don't you go
back to New Orleans?

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
We have to learn
to live together.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Last time I saw something this powerful

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
with picket signs
in the street tomorrow.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I caught one of them
Lethal Interjection cats

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
You been there your whole life.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
Shoot, you betcha.
Mr. Bitches is back in effect.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Oh. I'm never gonna
get married.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
was at the end of  The Mighty Ducks.

19:44.000 --> 19:44.000
Yeah.
Exactly.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
out here slipping. You know,
I ain't gotta say which one.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Don't let 'em
take your home away.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Really?
Hey, now.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Exactly. That's
what I'm talking about.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Twenty bucks and a Lunchable

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
I might as well just
blow myself up right now.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
What a miracle moment.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
Not without a fight.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Heh-heh. Uh, you--
You should have seen it.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
can motivate a whole lot
of activism, brother.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Remember to hit the bitch.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
That's a really
grown-up way

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
But, uh, if he wanna buy his chain back,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
Mm-hm. You--
You know, Huey, you right.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, man.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Right.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
:
Hey, guys.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Phew.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
to look at it,
Thugnificent.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Motherfucked!

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
Oh. You think
that'll make 'em pay us?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Thank you so much for
doing that. I mean, you guys

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
What are you doing here?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Not that I'm pole-jocking
or nothing.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
BOTH:
No!

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
That's right. That's what we
really want to do is go home.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
They couldn't handle it.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
A fake protest?
Granddad,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Gee, that bitch can fight.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You guys unionized and staged
a walkout that quickly?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Wait. Luna,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
just went above and beyond.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
RUCKUS:
Well, another nigga

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Hey, everybody good
in here? Beverages?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I ain't hidin'.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
It sure is good
to be home, though.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Oh, my God. Stop.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I mean, really--

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
you have another choice.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
Pricks, shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Ain't that right, gang?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
you can't go around hustling
controversy for profit.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's amazing.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
successfully exorcised
and/or beaten.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
You a beautiful,
talented woman.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
SWAY:  Thugnificent could not be reached for comment.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
ALL: Yeah.
The Lord is going to provide.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Guys, just wait. Wait!

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, yeah.
We unionized.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Sarah.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Why not?
You're messing with forces

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I mean, bitch...

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
And once you let go
of the past,

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Shit.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Then someone called
the corporate headquarters,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I'll send you
an invoice, Robert.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
What about you,
big guy? You good?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
you'll be able to have
any man you want.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm sorry, guys.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Then let's go. Come on,
everybody, get your stuff.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Let's clean this up.
All right.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
you can't control, Granddad.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
and they shut down
the whole place.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
get your ass in the car.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Possessed or not,
you gonna fix my damn house.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I did everything I could
to get it back.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
I'm telling you, Robert,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Fired everybody.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
I don't know.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
: We've been showing it all day,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
they are on the ropes, man.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
Are you sure I shouldn't
just blow myself up?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Why didn't you tell us
as soon as it got took?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
simply unbelievable.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
: You've reached Robert--

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Excuse me, Dolemite.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
You gonna have
another demon,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
I didn't
want y'all to think

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
We just gotta apply
a little more pressure.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, um...

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
it's gonna be my foot
up your ass.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Little Billy Mathews
playing his first game

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
So you really bought
that "go home" shit?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
WOMAN: Please enter your password.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Hey.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
BOTH:
No!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
I couldn't handle
my own business like a man.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
You have 22 unheard messages. First message:

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
power to the people?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You heard me, beyotch.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Let me get that
for you, homey.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
Luna, it's like the great
Tae Bo master

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
in the Woodcrest Youth
Basketball League, get this:

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
Shit, we just got a check
for 200 G's. Nigga, let's roll.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Granddad,
you're not getting paid.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
CATCHER:
Stand still, bitch!

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Fuck you.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Why am I in Riley's bed?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Riley.
That's the whole point

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Any of y'all
need a coaster?

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
RUCKUS: Robert. Them little niggers

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
are evil. It was terrible.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Just let it go.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Tom, please calm down

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
RILEY:
You know, that's

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
a real good question.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Let me go get y'all
these coasters right quick.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Billy Blanks always says:
"Take control of your life.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
of belonging to a crew,
nigga.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
Twelve for 12 from downtown.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Nah. I think
maybe Huey's right.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and let me go.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
So you ain't never got to worry
about handling shit like a man.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Oh, all the things that they done--

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Man, how would you like to be

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Why are you in my bed?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Now, old man,
we feel like

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Take responsibility."

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
the poor kid guarding Billy in this game?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
Jericho, look, I'm sorry.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
WOMAN: Deleted.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Yep. I think I'm done.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
All the beds in this house

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Put the grenade away
and go home.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Now, now. You ain't got
to start all that apologizing.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
TOM: Hey, Robert. This is Tom.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, that's that.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
we been very courteous
neighbors.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Yeah, man.
We don't fight fair, nigga.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
How about this?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Come on, boys.
I was wrong

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Wait, wait, wait. He meant to shoot Thelma,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
and I got the possessed nigga
in my bed.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Courteous. What about
the loud party?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
You're right.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
The movie rights to Billy Mathews sold today

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
We was both raised better.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
We believe
in overwhelming force.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Found out some great stuff about Costa Rica. Ha, ha.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
about the mansion
and the white women.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
but shot Massa instead?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
about stealing movies.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Ain't this a bitch?
Some old bullshit.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Nigga, you gave us permission
to have that party.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
I should take
responsibility.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I'm still gonna break you
a piece of that FEMA check

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Now, that's an ending.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Flo, go with the little nigga
to get his chain back.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
for a cool million dollars,

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
I'll miss
those flat butts.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Buy the bootleg.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Hey, look, man,
I think you should calm down.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
and there is talk, get this,

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
when it show up.
If you still want it.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Well, fine. Fine, then.
Mo' money for me.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
GRANDDAD: My ending was better.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Or just download it
from the Internet

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, I'll go with you right now

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Call me back.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
RUCKUS: That ain't good white history.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
and beat the little shit
into the dirt.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
of giving Billy his own sneaker.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
WOMAN: Deleted.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
like everybody else.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Uh, don't worry.
Are you sure, Robert?

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
TOM: Robert, it's Big Tom.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
Holler back!

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Uh, hello?
Hello, Chauncy.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
But...the script.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Ah!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
That's not my signature.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Fuck the bullshit.
Come on, let's go.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Way to go, buddy,
you deserve it.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
The money gonna
be here in no time.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The hell--?
TOM: You can't have my wife!

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
Finally, a kid who knows
what the game is all about.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
I mean, it be in my pocket
sooner than you think.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Heh-heh-heh. Time to--

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Hey, now, Chauncy,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
That's colored man history you talking.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Wow. You know,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
WOMAN: Deleted.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Hey, uh, I think
I'm gonna go

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
No. Everything's okay,
Nicole.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
Aw, that's okay.
Whoa, now, Robert,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
TOM:  Hey, Robert--
WOMAN:  Deleted.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
No, them niggas don't

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
HUEY: That moment,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Catcher decided it was best

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Daddy. What did you do
to Usher?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
gonna be a whole
lot of money.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
TOM: What the hell, Robert?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Did you go without me?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
He told me I should take
responsibility

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Uh, you know,
you need it more than me.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
to just go with the winning team.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Hey. Can you guys wait
here a sec?

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Who's up

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
You went without me. I know you went. You did.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000

guacamole --

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
and let go of the past.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
MAN: This is a Channel 5 News

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
Uh, die, cracker, die?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
There's something
I need to take care of.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Jazmine?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
Well, what about parking
all those damn cars

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I get it, I get it.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
You did not go without me--
WOMAN:  Deleted.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Daddy. Leave Usher alone.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
So you do all of that,

20:33.000 --> 20:34.000
FLONOMINAL: Butch Magnus.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
If you don't want none,
I understand.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
TOM: That's real nice, Robert.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
That's real fucking--

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
God! Bless the lord. Move!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Yeah. Take that, Massa. Huh?!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
What are you doing?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
Yeah, motherfucker.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
I understand completely.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
That was the scene earlier today in front

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Why are you trying
to kill Usher?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Man, how was we to know valet
was parking cars on your yard?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Hm. You know what?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
You fuck with one member
of the Lethal Interjection,

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
WOMAN: Deleted.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I wouldn't want to give you
something you don't want.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
Niggas was
passed out by then.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
He didn't say.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
of the Woodcrest School District headquarters

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Yeah. You wanna
beat up on the slaves, huh?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes, Super Fly.
What did Usher ever do to you?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
Ooh, Luna. That means no.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
you're fucking with
every last one of us.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
That right, nobody need

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
We was fixing to
come over and apologize.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
to give you something
you don't need.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
during a protest being held by Rollo Goodlove.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Jazmine wanted
to meet Usher.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Come try all that
tough shit with me --

20:41.000 --> 20:45.000
Well, take this to your ass,
motherfucker!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
But then you had to go off
and start filing complaints

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh, my God, girl. I am so sorry.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
If you don't want it,
I won't force you.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
You're an animal.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Ooh.
Oh, man.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Stacy Renee is on the scene.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
and doing all that
old gay shit.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You told this man your life story,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
You just such
a philanthropologist.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Bob, what Rollo Goodlove didn't know

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Is Usher okay?

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Oh, Catcher.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
THUGNIFICENT:
And you know what hurts me

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
and he just dissed you like that?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Oh.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
You're such a good giver.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
That's how I do it, baby.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So you're not--?
No.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Is that you didn't respect us
enough as homeowners

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
My motherfucking leg.
Leg, uh --

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
was that the Sisters of the Second Amendment

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
If a man said that to me, oh, my God,

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
BUTCH: Man, you can take
this piece-of-shit chain.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
You like a saint.
You like Saint Robert.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
That's how I do it.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
GUARD: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Easy, boys.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
to just talk things out
in a neighborly fashion.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
I don't think I could handle it.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
had scheduled a completely unrelated protest

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
And so was born the legend of Catcher Freeman.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
That's a really
powerful sentiment

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I would just freaking die.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
My dad had it appraised.
He said it was worthless.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Ow!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
There should be a little school.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
Catcher and Thelma married and moved to Canada.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, nigga.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
HUEY: And that was the day

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Ms. Luna decided

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Dressed up--
Ask people to wear a uniform

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
right across the street.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
TOM:
Oh, okay. I see what this is.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
you just expressed
right there, Thugnificent.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
We reserved this spot three months ago,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
SARAH:
Stop! Don't hurt him.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
to take responsibility for her own actions.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
Oh, Jesus.
My motherfuck--

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and they come there
and they pray to you every day.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Well, what about all that stuff
in the video, huh?

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
and that black nigger came and stole our press

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
His script was never produced.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
I just tell you--

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
She still there?
Why ain't she leaving?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh. Oh, Jesus.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
All right.
Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
And they all lived,
more or less,

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Oh, nigga, that was
just entertainment.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Maybe she's still talking
to her friend.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
You broke bitch.
Get a real chain.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
LEONA RAY:
It wasn't much, but thank you.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
with whatever bullshit he's protesting over there.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
You being real sensitive
right now, man.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
happily ever after.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Well, I hope her friend
isn't giving her more bad--

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
My leg is broken.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Yeah, man. Anybody could see

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
I'll pray for you.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Ho-ho, but we have something for that ass.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
He didn't
mean it.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
ALL: Whoa!

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Thank you.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Just do it very, very far away.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
He was trying to hit me.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
that that was
a satirical ass-beating.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
Man, that's
some old bullshit.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Never heard such bullshit
in all my life.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Tom!
TOM:

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I've never felt so much pain!

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Granddad, if you apologize
to Thugnificent

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
HUEY: Um, okay. Then that was the day

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Motherfucking
stupid-ass bitch.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
KID:
We're going to New Orleans.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
RILEY:
Hey, hold up.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Where y'all going?

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm sorry, Usher!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
for filing
the complaint,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Ms. Luna let her girlfriend

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Motherfucker.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Help! Move! Bitch, get out of my way.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
I ain't had a chance
to tell my story yet.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
then I'm sure,
Thugnificent,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
talk her into blowing herself up

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
RILEY: Know what? It's still better

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
That's it, go back.
Sayonara, you sorry niggas.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
That's the way.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
My Catcher Freeman story

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
you will be willing to
apologize for the video.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
instead of taking responsibility

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
That's it. We don't wanna have to shoot you.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
USHER:
Shut the fuck up,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Tom.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
for her own actions.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
than an old funky necklace.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Know what I'm sayin'?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
This weekend sucked.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
White man brought in
the whole Gulf of Mexico

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Oh, man. That ended badly.
ROLLO:  And--

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
See, my Catcher Freeman
wasn't no slave.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
And it was all
your fault, Granddad.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Call some-motherfucking-body,
Riley!

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
to wash y'all niggas away,
but go on back.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
'Cause he was like, "Fuck that
shit. I'm a real nigga."

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Wasn't
my fault.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And not only did they shoot at us,

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It was that crazy-ass
Luna's fault

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
Hell, no, I ain't
apologizing, punk-ass nigga.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
for not taking
responsibility.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
We crew, nigga,
remember?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
You niggas ain't
too good at taking a hint,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
they referred to us as the N-word.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Plus, he had like 300 ho's.
He ain't had just no Thelma.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
now, are ya?
Go on, save New Orleans.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
God rest
her poor soul.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Help me, Riley!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Several times.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
He had all kinds of bitches,
and he drove a Bentley Coupe

21:21.000 --> 21:23.000
Kiss my ass,
old-ass nigga.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
What they got down there
worth saving? What, jazz?

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
And we definitely intend to make them pay, damn it.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Please.
Stupid-ass--

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
NICOLE: Hello? Hello?

21:23.000 --> 21:24.000
with 24's on it

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
What was that noise?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Wait a minute.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
with machine guns
in the rims, nigga, what?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Jazz music?
I hate jazz music.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I'll bet those old broads
are rolling in money.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Can we at least agree,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Anyway, like I said, girl,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
for the sake of
old people everywhere,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
Sounds like a long car accident
involving some cats.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
if a man ever said that to me, I'll kill myself.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
He's gonna get rich
for sure.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
that there will be
no more dis records?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I mean, you're a stronger woman than me. Hello?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Hey, y'all seen that movie When the Levees Broke?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Damn it. That's the last time
I'm gonna listen to you.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Fine, whatever.
I spits hot fire.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Hello? A life without a man to take care of your ass

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I got a documentary called

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
I could have been shot at and  called a nigger on TV!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
When the Levees Gonna Break Again?

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
I'll eat your ass up
on the M-I-C,

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
ain't worth living. So go back in there, girl,

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
But no. I had to listen to you.
You blockhead!

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
if you keep messing
with me.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
and torture him until he proposes.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'm gonna get me a dog.
Name him Levee.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm gonna kick him
every time it rain.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
That's what you need to do.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
Well, one thing's for sure. I've learned my lesson.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
I'm never, ever gonna say any form of "nigger."

21:45.000 --> 21:46.000
You gonna pay for
my lawn, boy.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Eat a dick, old nigga.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.000
I'm cured of that.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
No nigga, no nyukka,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
Yeah, you know, what  Rags to Bitches  means

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
uh, with the "Y-U" sound.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
is that there's more to life than what you're born into.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Not even the abbreviated "my nig." None.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
No more nigger. Nuh-- Uh-uh.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
There's also bitches.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
And that's why I'm pushing for a constitutional amendment

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
that will protect the white man's right

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
to say any incarnation of the word "nigga"

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
at any time, spelled any way,

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
whether it be N-I-G-G-U-H, G-G-A, G-G-A-H,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
or a silent "P" at the beginning of it,

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
without fear of persecution or litigation.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
I don't think black people should ever use racist words

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
when describing other black people.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
And if you do, then you're a sambo and a coon.
