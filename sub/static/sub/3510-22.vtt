00:30.750 --> 00:34.750
Castle s04e22
Undead Again

00:39.177 --> 00:39.914
Dad...

00:39.968 --> 00:41.033
What are you doing?

00:41.464 --> 00:43.578
You have 30 seconds to suit up.

00:43.579 --> 00:44.333
I...

00:44.710 --> 00:45.796
the game's afoot.

00:45.797 --> 00:48.663
- Dad...
- Wait. Let me savor this.

00:48.974 --> 00:50.797
I haven't gotten the drop
on you since you were 10.

00:51.464 --> 00:52.793
Oh, this feels like...

00:54.378 --> 00:55.515
victory.

00:55.672 --> 00:57.519
Dad, look, I can't, okay?

00:57.697 --> 00:59.662
I have a big decision to make.

01:00.020 --> 01:01.705
Well, have you at least
narrowed it down?

01:02.059 --> 01:03.396
I made a list of all the classes

01:03.397 --> 01:04.985
and the extra curriculars.

01:04.986 --> 01:07.090
And the best choices seem to be

01:07.115 --> 01:08.669
Oxford and Stanford.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.742
What about Columbia,
NYU, Vassar?

01:10.743 --> 01:11.794
They're all too close.

01:11.795 --> 01:13.217
I'd come home all the time.

01:13.564 --> 01:15.214
I want to challenge myself,

01:15.215 --> 01:17.883
and I'd get sucked in
to things like this.

01:18.715 --> 01:20.497
But then who's gonna
play with me?

01:23.774 --> 01:26.287
I think it's time to
holster the laser guns

01:26.288 --> 01:27.555
and be adults.

01:45.556 --> 01:46.716
<i>Game over.</i>

01:47.150 --> 01:48.650
<i>Please, press exit.</i>

01:48.708 --> 01:49.748
Oh, darling,

01:49.808 --> 01:51.192
it's just a game.

01:51.193 --> 01:52.083
No, it's not.

01:52.084 --> 01:54.577
It's... it's a time-honored
family tradition

01:54.578 --> 01:56.487
that we've been
honoring since Alexis

01:56.488 --> 01:59.047
could wrap her little
finger around a trigger.

01:59.048 --> 02:00.893
First one to 1,000 points wins,

02:00.894 --> 02:02.525
and we were so close.

02:03.025 --> 02:03.876
We...

02:03.982 --> 02:06.398
laser tagged our way
through her preteen years,

02:06.399 --> 02:07.623
and now suddenly,

02:07.717 --> 02:09.832
she's... too old to play.

02:09.833 --> 02:10.812
She's growing up.

02:10.814 --> 02:12.625
Well, she doesn't have to.
Look at me.

02:16.029 --> 02:17.074
Ah, well, it seems...

02:17.075 --> 02:20.207
Detective Beckett is
available for a play date.

02:24.592 --> 02:25.669
Really?

02:26.593 --> 02:28.559
Beckett and I have
not been exactly

02:28.825 --> 02:30.456
hitting it off lately.

02:32.516 --> 02:34.379
And why do you think that is?

02:35.759 --> 02:37.605
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Are you saying it's my fault?

02:37.606 --> 02:40.212
Cavorting with some
awful gang detective,

02:40.213 --> 02:42.701
showing up at a crime
scene with a stewardess...

02:43.303 --> 02:44.901
if you want to punish Beckett,

02:44.902 --> 02:46.696
at least let her know why.

02:46.697 --> 02:48.151
I'm not punishing her.

02:48.657 --> 02:49.556
I'm...

02:51.011 --> 02:51.912
Am I?

02:52.855 --> 02:56.124
Oh, darling, you're hurt.
I understand that.

02:56.125 --> 02:59.318
But quite honestly, the two of
you cannot go on like this.

03:03.736 --> 03:04.812
You know what, mother?

03:06.102 --> 03:07.361
You're absolutely right.

03:12.857 --> 03:13.714
Where are you going?

03:13.715 --> 03:14.821
To a crime scene...

03:15.930 --> 03:18.375
to work my last case
with detective Beckett.

03:27.276 --> 03:28.319
You said you didn't like coffee.

03:28.320 --> 03:29.790
I like vanilla lattes.

03:29.791 --> 03:30.751
Hey, guys.

03:30.986 --> 03:32.388
Hey. Thanks for calling.

03:32.957 --> 03:33.731
Sure.

03:33.982 --> 03:36.550
So our victim is David Lock, 29.

03:36.551 --> 03:37.362
He's a currency trader

03:37.363 --> 03:39.088
in a foreign exchange
office upstairs.

03:39.089 --> 03:41.627
Looks like he was heading
into work when it happened.

03:41.628 --> 03:43.668
His body was found by his boss...

03:43.669 --> 03:45.127
at around 7:00 this morning.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.237
Our intrepid heroes
have arrived.

03:49.183 --> 03:50.203
And Castle.

03:50.204 --> 03:51.741
Ah, Perlmutter.

03:52.223 --> 03:55.059
I will treasure these special
moments we've shared.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.722
So I take it that
this is Mr. Lock?

03:59.916 --> 04:03.042
It appears he was set upon
by an unknown assailant.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.939
Time of death was about 4:00 AM.

04:04.940 --> 04:05.721
Cause of death?

04:05.722 --> 04:09.249
Well, probably blunt
force trauma to the head

04:09.266 --> 04:10.921
where it hit the concrete.

04:11.055 --> 04:12.077
Wallet and cash?

04:12.322 --> 04:14.233
Still intact, so it
definitely wasn't a mugging.

04:14.234 --> 04:17.079
A savage beating at 4:00 AM,
there must be some motive.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.009
Is this a bite mark on his arm?

04:19.178 --> 04:21.964
It's not just a bite mark.
Look at the skin.

04:22.103 --> 04:23.524
You see how it's torn?

04:23.614 --> 04:26.793
The killer latched on and
shook like a pit bull

04:26.794 --> 04:28.099
trying to tear off the flesh.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.189
Thanks. Think we got it.

04:31.363 --> 04:32.253
Anything else?

04:32.254 --> 04:33.389
Just this.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.667
It was, uh, found in
our victim's hand.

04:35.668 --> 04:37.184
It was probably torn
off the killer's shirt

04:37.185 --> 04:38.156
during the struggle.

04:38.157 --> 04:39.653
That's a lace cuff.

04:39.864 --> 04:41.748
Hand stitched, pearl buttons...

04:41.749 --> 04:44.746
I'd say this was circa 1870.

04:45.813 --> 04:47.513
I did a lot of
research on the era.

04:47.514 --> 04:49.740
I was writing a book, a
comedy about the Civil War.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.174
Turns out... not so funny.

04:52.352 --> 04:53.306
You don't say?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.233
Who would beat a guy to death
wearing a 150-year-old shirt?

04:56.234 --> 04:57.401
You know, the
bigger question is,

04:57.402 --> 05:00.318
why was he attacked
here where he worked?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.987
You might want to ask his boss...

05:02.417 --> 05:03.573
Mike Matthews.

05:05.664 --> 05:06.591
I can't believe it.

05:06.592 --> 05:08.937
We think that David
was killed around 4:00 AM.

05:08.938 --> 05:11.066
Do you have any idea why
he was here so early?

05:11.067 --> 05:12.497
David handled the Asian markets,

05:12.498 --> 05:14.327
so he usually got in by 4:00.

05:15.396 --> 05:16.521
He was a terrific kid.

05:16.522 --> 05:18.923
You know, he was
hard-working, well-liked.

05:18.924 --> 05:20.727
And was that the consensus?

05:21.049 --> 05:21.932
What do you mean?

05:21.933 --> 05:24.355
I mean, did he have any
conflicts with anyone at work?

05:24.822 --> 05:27.368
Actually, yeah, there was
an incident last week.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.744
Someone keyed his car.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.355
Who?

05:29.356 --> 05:30.889
David thought it was
Charlie Coleman,

05:30.890 --> 05:32.204
one of my other traders.

05:32.205 --> 05:34.799
Uh, the two of them were
vying for a promotion,

05:35.236 --> 05:36.619
and I went with David.

05:37.062 --> 05:39.275
Charlie didn't take it too well.

05:39.276 --> 05:41.314
What time does Charlie
usually show up for work?

05:41.315 --> 05:43.129
4:00 AM, same time as David.

05:43.762 --> 05:45.735
Look, Charlie's...

05:45.769 --> 05:46.709
kind of an oddball,

05:46.710 --> 05:48.720
but I-I don't see him
mixed up in this.

05:48.721 --> 05:50.427
We're gonna need to
talk to him anyway.

05:52.148 --> 05:53.210
That's strange.

05:53.765 --> 05:56.101
His car is right there
next to David's.

05:56.365 --> 05:57.321
Why is that strange?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.545
Because Charlie never came
into the office this morning.

06:01.176 --> 06:02.311
What's his address?

06:03.521 --> 06:04.500
That's a shame.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.779
This case had some real promise.

06:06.780 --> 06:10.575
Savage bite marks,
reconstruction-era clothing...

06:11.140 --> 06:12.957
we had some mystery here,
a whiff of intrigue.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.200
Now we're just slapping cuffs
on some disgruntled employee.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.556
I just wanted this
one to be special.

06:19.557 --> 06:20.162
Yeah, well, I'm sorry

06:20.163 --> 06:22.209
it's not entertaining
enough for you, Castle.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.131
Charlie Coleman, NYPD. Open up.

06:25.132 --> 06:26.951
Stay away! It isn't safe!

06:27.520 --> 06:28.531
Stand back.

06:29.344 --> 06:30.160
It's for your own good!

06:30.161 --> 06:32.907
Don't come in!
You can't come in here!

06:32.916 --> 06:33.840
Sorry, Charlie.

06:33.922 --> 06:35.195
Charlie, are you okay?
Anyone here?

06:35.196 --> 06:36.332
No, no, no, no. Get back!

06:36.333 --> 06:37.319
Get away from me!

06:37.353 --> 06:38.835
Listen, we just gotta ask
you a few questions.

06:38.836 --> 06:40.985
You need to leave!
You need to leave right now!

06:40.986 --> 06:41.977
It's not safe!

06:41.978 --> 06:44.634
Relax, Charlie.
Relax. We're cops.

06:44.807 --> 06:46.240
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

06:46.297 --> 06:47.234
Is that your gun?

06:48.094 --> 06:48.771
Yeah.

06:48.772 --> 06:50.521
You need to shoot me. Do it now!

06:50.999 --> 06:51.893
Do it!

06:52.207 --> 06:53.194
Do it!

06:55.665 --> 06:56.909
Okay, Charlie, you
feeling better?

06:56.910 --> 06:57.850
Uh, yeah.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.251
Just gotta ask you
a few questions

06:59.252 --> 07:01.635
about what happened this
morning with you and David.

07:01.641 --> 07:03.514
Did you see him in the
parking structure?

07:03.657 --> 07:05.006
Yeah, he'd just pulled in.

07:05.588 --> 07:06.970
I said hello. He said hello.

07:06.971 --> 07:08.457
The two of us aren't
real friendly.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.408
So we've heard.
What happened next?

07:10.465 --> 07:11.795
And then he stopped...

07:12.839 --> 07:15.923
and he stared right past me with
this weird look on his face,

07:15.924 --> 07:17.797
and then he said, "What
the hell is that?"

07:18.388 --> 07:20.013
- What the hell was it?
- I couldn't tell at first,

07:20.014 --> 07:21.491
'cause suddenly, it
was all over us.

07:21.492 --> 07:23.060
Wait. You were attacked, too?

07:23.061 --> 07:24.325
Yeah, but it was
mostly after David.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.864
I mean, it was just
wailing on him.

07:25.865 --> 07:28.089
I elbowed it in the head, and
it didn't even slow down.

07:28.090 --> 07:29.135
Okay, what do you mean by "it"?

07:29.136 --> 07:31.394
I called 9-1-1. I told them.
They didn't believe me.

07:31.395 --> 07:32.743
No one believes me.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.222
Just tell us what you saw.

07:36.306 --> 07:38.020
As long as you promise
you'll believe me.

07:38.021 --> 07:39.025
Yeah, fine. I promise.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.102
Promise...

07:40.637 --> 07:42.127
that you will use your gun on me

07:42.579 --> 07:43.824
when I start to turn.

07:44.483 --> 07:45.644
- Turn?
- Yeah.

07:45.645 --> 07:46.604
What do you mean, turn?

07:47.944 --> 07:49.163
The thing that bit me...

07:50.018 --> 07:51.339
that killed David...

07:56.437 --> 07:57.748
it was a zombie.

07:59.397 --> 08:00.933
A z-zombie?

08:00.953 --> 08:02.805
It was a zombie.
A freakin' zombie!

08:03.034 --> 08:04.687
Sir, can you repeat that?

08:04.688 --> 08:07.886
A zombie. The undead. Oh, man...
with those dead eyes

08:07.887 --> 08:10.274
and flaps of rotting skin
coming off its face.

08:10.275 --> 08:12.330
Uh, sir, this line is
for emergencies only.

08:12.331 --> 08:13.938
Are you having an emergency?

08:14.033 --> 08:16.232
Yes! I am having a
major emergency here.

08:16.233 --> 08:17.072
Don't you get it?

08:17.073 --> 08:19.577
This thing just killed
someone, and it bit me!

08:19.578 --> 08:21.232
I'm gonna turn! I'm next.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.928
Now Charlie made this 9-1-1 call

08:24.959 --> 08:27.058
moments after the attack.

08:27.059 --> 08:28.626
Does it sound like
he's faking to you?

08:28.627 --> 08:31.335
It sounds like Charlie's
having a psychotic break.

08:31.999 --> 08:33.957
What if his guilt made him snap

08:33.957 --> 08:35.024
and he created a fantasy

08:35.025 --> 08:37.573
in which zombies killed
David and not him?

08:37.626 --> 08:38.640
I'm not so sure.

08:38.956 --> 08:41.557
I mean, his voice does have
that authentic ring of

08:41.789 --> 08:43.087
pants-wetting terror.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.052
You do not believe
in Charlie's story.

08:45.053 --> 08:46.071
I believe he believes it.

08:46.072 --> 08:47.412
Okay, well, whatever
you believe,

08:47.413 --> 08:48.754
all of the evidence
points to the fact

08:48.755 --> 08:50.316
that Charlie Coleman
is our killer.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.228
Maybe not all the evidence.

08:52.229 --> 08:55.512
CSU analyzed that bite
mark on Charlie's arm.

08:55.513 --> 08:57.959
Turns out that it matches the
bite mark on our victim.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.113
Maybe Charlie bit David
and then he bit himself?

09:00.114 --> 09:01.960
I was thinking the same thing,
but CSU also says

09:01.961 --> 09:03.783
that the bite marks weren't
made by Charlie's teeth.

09:03.784 --> 09:04.933
Oh, wait, um...

09:05.340 --> 09:06.202
sorry.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.325
Let me make sure I understand

09:08.326 --> 09:11.281
so that I might properly
relish this moment.

09:11.337 --> 09:12.583
You're saying...

09:12.950 --> 09:15.055
the evidence shows that
Charlie and the victim

09:15.056 --> 09:20.004
both were bitten by an
as-yet unknown third party.

09:20.503 --> 09:21.844
- That's what I just said.
- Perhaps even

09:22.793 --> 09:23.893
a mindless...

09:24.078 --> 09:25.135
shuffling...

09:26.265 --> 09:27.166
undead third party.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.638
Castle, just stop.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.659
There's no such
thing as a zombie.

09:30.939 --> 09:31.809
Guys...

09:34.335 --> 09:35.501
uh, you gotta see this.

09:35.732 --> 09:37.523
So I was combing through
security cam footage

09:37.524 --> 09:39.842
near the parking garage,
and I found this.

09:44.764 --> 09:46.518
Time stamp's 4:06 AM,

09:46.519 --> 09:47.777
which fits time of death.

09:47.931 --> 09:48.749
That's our guy.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.208
Yeah, but that's not Charlie.

09:50.321 --> 09:51.489
Wait. What is he wearing?

09:52.453 --> 09:53.623
That looks like

09:53.624 --> 09:55.169
an old-fashioned suit.

09:55.170 --> 09:57.277
Circa 1870 and...

09:57.655 --> 09:58.966
his shirt's missing a cuff.

10:00.673 --> 10:02.626
He almost got hit by that taxi.
He didn't even flinch.

10:02.627 --> 10:03.915
Well, maybe this is why.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.344
Look what we get from
the other angle.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.041
My friends...

10:25.396 --> 10:26.366
that...

10:27.556 --> 10:28.645
is a zombie.

10:33.017 --> 10:34.244
Our killer's a zombie.

10:48.131 --> 10:50.228
Well, you're rather upbeat
considering you said

10:50.229 --> 10:52.238
this was your last
case with Beckett.

10:52.239 --> 10:55.491
That's because I am
going out with a bang.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.506
I have one word for you, mother...

10:58.940 --> 10:59.827
Zombie.

10:59.870 --> 11:01.236
- Too much makeup?
- You look lovely.

11:01.237 --> 11:02.134
I'm referring to our victim

11:02.135 --> 11:04.221
being killed by one of
the walking undead.

11:04.562 --> 11:07.543
And I mean that
literally... a zombie.

11:07.544 --> 11:11.172
Security camera caught him
in all his putrefying glory.

11:12.407 --> 11:15.375
I don't suppose you downloaded
this video by chance?

11:15.376 --> 11:17.647
Absolutely not.
That video's police property.

11:17.648 --> 11:19.086
It would be very, very
wrong of me to...

11:19.187 --> 11:21.647
get a screen grab of it
and e-mail it to myself.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.518
Ooh. Well, it'll be our
little secret, darling.

11:24.561 --> 11:25.308
I'm actually surprised

11:25.309 --> 11:26.866
at your interest in
this case, mother.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.312
Well, I really do
know the difference

11:28.313 --> 11:31.327
between a first-rate makeup
job and actual decay.

11:31.606 --> 11:33.383
You want to see
some real zombies,

11:33.384 --> 11:35.685
check out the red carpet
at the Tony Awards.

11:37.188 --> 11:38.140
I thought I...

11:39.607 --> 11:40.965
I thought I put this away.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.949
Where is she?

11:48.648 --> 11:49.646
Where is she?

11:52.252 --> 11:53.946
You were a fool to buy
my act yesterday.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.749
And now you've fallen
right into my trap.

11:57.256 --> 11:59.073
You will pay dearly
for your treachery.

11:59.074 --> 12:01.349
Et tu, mother, for
luring me here.

12:01.350 --> 12:02.693
Why, whatever do you mean?

12:03.949 --> 12:04.957
That's my girl.

12:05.553 --> 12:07.089
So what's this about a zombie?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.363
Oh, my God.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.317
I told you people. That's him.

12:12.318 --> 12:14.922
Oh, so vile and disgusting...

12:14.923 --> 12:16.662
that's the zombie that I saw.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.708
Well, we're not exactly
sure that he's a...

12:18.709 --> 12:19.668
What do you mean,
you're not sure?

12:19.669 --> 12:21.034
What else could he be?

12:23.331 --> 12:25.816
The point is, this
puts you in the clear.

12:25.824 --> 12:27.069
We're releasing you.

12:31.154 --> 12:32.883
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

12:33.474 --> 12:34.461
Charlie, if you
were going to turn,

12:34.462 --> 12:35.754
you would have done it by now.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.371
This thing, have you caught it?

12:40.200 --> 12:42.166
Not yet. Rest assured, we will.

12:49.797 --> 12:51.288
I'll just stay here.

12:52.649 --> 12:53.877
He won't leave?

12:53.878 --> 12:56.482
Charlie's pretty convinced
about this whole zombie thing.

12:56.483 --> 12:58.476
Yeah, but that's just...
that's ridiculous.

12:58.487 --> 12:59.412
Or is it?

12:59.798 --> 13:01.671
Charlie has not been wrong yet.

13:01.672 --> 13:03.479
Maybe our killer
is patient zero,

13:03.480 --> 13:05.193
out there right now on
the streets of New York,

13:05.194 --> 13:06.758
building an army of the undead.

13:06.761 --> 13:08.165
Castle, what we are looking for

13:08.166 --> 13:09.635
is not a zombie,

13:09.636 --> 13:12.022
but a very smart criminal
who murdered David Lock

13:12.023 --> 13:14.258
and is now making our
only witness look crazy,

13:14.259 --> 13:15.866
and he also dressed up

13:15.867 --> 13:18.068
in makeup and a costume
to hide his identity.

13:18.069 --> 13:19.940
Unless that's not a
costume or makeup.

13:19.947 --> 13:22.544
I mean, he does look
like a real zombie.

13:22.909 --> 13:23.840
A real zombie?

13:24.550 --> 13:25.992
I'm embarrassed for you, bro.

13:27.107 --> 13:27.922
Okay, then explain this...

13:27.923 --> 13:29.132
why would a zombie go after

13:29.133 --> 13:32.024
a currency trader at
4:00 AM in a garage?

13:33.017 --> 13:33.931
This one's easy.

13:34.786 --> 13:36.364
The more intelligent the victim,

13:36.573 --> 13:38.116
the more delicious the brains.

13:39.351 --> 13:42.173
So returning to the
land of facts,

13:42.174 --> 13:43.992
what did you find at the
crime scene canvass?

13:44.016 --> 13:44.609
Nada.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.938
Only in New York could some guy
dress like a friggin' zombie

13:46.939 --> 13:48.300
and walk down the
street unnoticed.

13:48.301 --> 13:49.885
Oh, I did find a gap

13:49.886 --> 13:51.956
in our timeline
before the murder.

13:51.957 --> 13:52.603
What do you mean?

13:52.604 --> 13:53.945
Well, according to the
doorman, the victim

13:53.946 --> 13:56.017
left his apartment at 2:00 AM
and he never came back.

13:56.018 --> 13:58.652
He was killed at 4:00 AM.
What was he doing for 2 hours?

13:58.653 --> 14:00.104
I don't know, but
he drove there.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.655
His credit card showed that he
gassed up on Houston at 2:44 AM.

14:03.656 --> 14:04.946
All right.
Let's figure out where he went.

14:04.947 --> 14:06.637
Trouble might have followed
him to the garage.

14:06.638 --> 14:07.321
Or a zombie did.

14:07.322 --> 14:09.330
I'll tell you where he went.

14:09.605 --> 14:10.562
Booty call.

14:11.153 --> 14:13.471
Tech guys pulled a text
message off David's phone.

14:13.536 --> 14:15.371
He sent it to a chica
the night he died

14:15.372 --> 14:16.717
wanting to hook up with her.

14:17.567 --> 14:18.748
Does she have a name?

14:18.749 --> 14:20.113
Greta Mastroianni.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.378
Look, I... I don't understand.

14:23.468 --> 14:24.969
Who would do something
like this to David?

14:24.970 --> 14:25.994
Did you see him that night?

14:25.995 --> 14:28.104
We know that he texted you
wanting to come over.

14:28.105 --> 14:30.243
No, I-I called him
and told him not to.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.086
I split up with David
about a week ago.

14:34.087 --> 14:35.792
Um, he was still
trying to hold on.

14:36.254 --> 14:37.301
Why'd you two split up?

14:39.376 --> 14:40.918
I'm engaged, um...

14:41.141 --> 14:43.290
to Tom... Tom Williams.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.532
We've been together five years.

14:46.879 --> 14:48.197
How did David figure in?

14:48.198 --> 14:49.577
I met him when I was 21,

14:50.084 --> 14:51.546
visiting a cousin in LA.

14:51.665 --> 14:53.687
We had an intense couple
of weeks, you know,

14:53.688 --> 14:55.945
then three months ago, I ran
into him at a coffee shop.

14:55.946 --> 14:59.259
And did your fiance know about
this affair with David?

14:59.260 --> 15:02.125
Yeah, he found, uh, e-mails
on my computer last week.

15:02.397 --> 15:03.642
And how did he react to that?

15:03.643 --> 15:05.776
He was hurt, he
threatened to leave me,

15:06.341 --> 15:07.793
and that's when I realized
what I was about to lose,

15:07.794 --> 15:09.090
so I broke it off with David

15:09.091 --> 15:10.917
and begged Tom to give
me another chance.

15:11.803 --> 15:12.690
And he did.

15:12.691 --> 15:14.109
So where was Tom that night?

15:14.345 --> 15:16.524
Home.
We went to bed around 11:00.

15:16.757 --> 15:18.001
And he was there all night?

15:19.934 --> 15:22.546
Greta...
where was Tom at 4:00 AM.?

15:22.547 --> 15:23.594
Look, I don't know, okay?

15:23.595 --> 15:25.893
I woke up around 2:30,
and he wasn't there.

15:25.894 --> 15:27.598
I figured he was watching
TV in the living room,

15:27.599 --> 15:29.623
but when I got up
in the morning...

15:29.624 --> 15:32.674
He wasn't in the apartment.
So where was he all night?

15:33.810 --> 15:36.135
I see what you're getting
at with this, okay?

15:36.136 --> 15:37.625
But Tom had nothing
to do with it.

15:37.626 --> 15:39.654
Did David e-mail you
from his office account?

15:40.929 --> 15:41.678
Yeah.

15:41.679 --> 15:42.628
Why?

15:43.281 --> 15:44.516
Because that means
that your fiance

15:44.517 --> 15:45.800
knew where David worked.

15:48.673 --> 15:52.114
Look, I can't say I feel
bad this guy is dead.

15:52.283 --> 15:53.993
But I had nothing to do with it.

15:54.130 --> 15:56.538
Even though he was trying
to snake your fiancee?

15:56.768 --> 15:58.036
He was out of the picture.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.416
Greta made her choice,
and she picked me.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.630
Yeah, except he wouldn't
take no for an answer.

16:04.471 --> 16:06.901
You know, I bet you found out
that he was texting her,

16:06.902 --> 16:09.566
and you decided to make
him stop texting her

16:09.971 --> 16:10.964
permanently.

16:12.348 --> 16:13.962
Well... you're wrong.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.167
I never touched the dude.
I never even met him.

16:16.168 --> 16:17.978
Yeah, but it had to
have made you angry.

16:21.508 --> 16:22.688
I- I won't lie to you.

16:22.796 --> 16:24.492
This whole thing has been tough.

16:25.270 --> 16:27.105
But Greta and I are
building a life together,

16:27.106 --> 16:28.632
and I think we're gonna
come out of it stronger...

16:28.633 --> 16:30.117
Tom, about how tall are you?

16:30.987 --> 16:31.843
About 6'?

16:32.380 --> 16:33.334
6'2".

16:33.335 --> 16:35.333
So about the same height
as this guy, right?

16:35.534 --> 16:36.706
What the hell is that?

16:38.499 --> 16:39.871
Come on. That's not me.

16:39.872 --> 16:41.946
When you left the
apartment that night,

16:41.987 --> 16:43.919
where were you for the
next hour and a half?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.749
David was missing for the
same amount of time...

16:45.750 --> 16:47.519
2:30 to 4:00 AM.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.286
A- at the Hudson Law
Library studying.

16:49.287 --> 16:51.004
You were at the
library at that hour?

16:51.005 --> 16:52.779
It's open 24/7 during finals.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.437
You can ask the librarian
and the ten other people

16:54.438 --> 16:55.575
who were studying there.

16:56.757 --> 16:57.679
I will.

17:02.098 --> 17:03.900
Tom's alibi checks out.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.250
He was at the law library
between 3:00 and 6:00 AM.

17:08.212 --> 17:10.375
I really thought
that he was our man.

17:10.522 --> 17:12.839
And it's not like David
Lock has any other enemies.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.000
I mean, we already
confirmed that

17:14.001 --> 17:15.647
with his friends and coworkers.

17:15.648 --> 17:17.906
What about recently deceased
friends and coworkers?

17:19.231 --> 17:22.404
Okay. Well, whatever
or whoever this is,

17:22.405 --> 17:25.570
can we at least agree that
he looks like a zombie,

17:25.571 --> 17:28.442
he dresses like a zombie,
and he acts like a zombie?

17:28.443 --> 17:29.611
And that helps us how?

17:30.278 --> 17:32.582
We're looking at
standard motives here.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.427
But our killer isn't driven
by revenge, greed, or power,

17:35.428 --> 17:36.536
not if he thinks he's a zombie.

17:36.537 --> 17:38.391
So then by that
line of thinking,

17:38.392 --> 17:41.016
his motive is a
primal urge to kill?

17:41.099 --> 17:43.317
Regardless of who the victim
is, he kills at random.

17:43.318 --> 17:44.023
Precisely.

17:44.024 --> 17:45.912
Then how do you propose that
we find a random killer

17:45.913 --> 17:47.460
in a city of eight
million people?

17:47.799 --> 17:48.575
Maybe we start

17:48.576 --> 17:51.130
with where the victim went
during those missing two hours.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.128
Do tell.

17:52.129 --> 17:54.463
Well, the lab ID'ed
a chemical found recently deposited

17:54.464 --> 17:55.921
under the bottom of
David Lock's shoes.

17:55.922 --> 17:57.182
What kind of chemical?

17:57.351 --> 17:59.082
Uh, I won't even begin
to try to pronounce it,

17:59.083 --> 18:01.587
but it is used in
three factories

18:01.588 --> 18:02.699
in New York and New Jersey.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.688
The night that David was killed,

18:03.689 --> 18:05.169
he went to a gas
station on Houston.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.072
Which one of those factories
is closest to Houston?

18:07.073 --> 18:08.108
The one on the Lower East Side,

18:08.109 --> 18:09.555
but it's been closed
for over a year.

18:10.019 --> 18:10.892
Let's go.

18:14.614 --> 18:17.652
Well, we know now this is, in
fact, an abandoned factory...

18:18.497 --> 18:20.958
in a desolate,
godforsaken alley.

18:21.711 --> 18:23.179
Imagination getting the
better of you, Castle?

18:23.180 --> 18:24.379
No, no. Of course not.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.951
Just wish we had more to show
for our efforts. That's all.

18:27.155 --> 18:28.553
The thing that I don't get is,

18:28.554 --> 18:31.676
why would a currency trader
like David Lock come down here?

18:31.677 --> 18:33.600
It just doesn't make any sense.

18:33.601 --> 18:35.335
Unless he had a dark side
we know nothing about.

18:35.622 --> 18:36.328
Like what?

18:36.329 --> 18:37.504
All I know is that normal people

18:37.505 --> 18:40.084
don't come to places like this
at 2:00 AM in the morning.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.749
In fact, I think I've seen enough.
Haven't you?

18:42.160 --> 18:44.206
Wait. Do you hear that?

18:44.889 --> 18:45.922
I'm not falling for that.

18:45.923 --> 18:48.036
No, no, no, I'm serious. Listen.

18:49.745 --> 18:51.147
- Footsteps.
- Yeah.

18:51.839 --> 18:52.704
Lots of 'em.

18:53.623 --> 18:54.290
Oh, my God!

18:54.291 --> 18:56.415
They're after us!
They're after us!

18:56.416 --> 18:57.510
Who is?

18:57.558 --> 18:59.724
What are you people doing?
Don't just stand there! Run!

18:59.803 --> 19:00.857
Come on!

19:01.048 --> 19:02.249
What the hell is going on?

19:10.414 --> 19:12.017
That's... that's a zombie...
that's a zombie horde.

19:12.018 --> 19:13.474
There's no such
thing as zombies.

19:13.725 --> 19:15.786
I'm sure I don't have to tell
you to aim for the head.

19:17.512 --> 19:19.523
Beckett, they're behind us.
We're surrounded.

19:20.114 --> 19:21.665
Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.

19:22.503 --> 19:23.680
You don't have enough bullets.

19:30.675 --> 19:32.194
It's ground zero
for world war Z.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.121
Get behind me.

19:35.319 --> 19:36.387
We'll have to fight our way out.

19:40.148 --> 19:40.937
This is so not cool.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.351
There's no way this is real.

19:43.034 --> 19:44.247
NYPD!

19:44.511 --> 19:46.162
Stop moving now.

19:46.676 --> 19:49.182
And stop pretending
to be zombies.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.251
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

19:51.252 --> 19:52.982
We're just zombie walking here.

19:54.755 --> 19:55.411
You're what?

19:55.804 --> 19:56.634
Zzzombie walking.

19:56.635 --> 19:58.288
It's like an amped
up form of tag.

19:58.289 --> 20:00.656
We... we dress up like zombies,
and we chase the normals.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.146
That would be us.

20:02.848 --> 20:04.507
Yeah, yeah, if we tag'em,
we turn 'em,

20:04.508 --> 20:05.937
and then they become
zombies, too.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.273
Look, if this is because we
didn't get a permit, I...

20:08.274 --> 20:09.142
It's not!

20:09.613 --> 20:11.145
You're all coming with me.
Now.

20:12.260 --> 20:13.800
How did I not know about this?!

20:15.508 --> 20:17.881
This is outstanding.
Did you do this yourself?

20:21.483 --> 20:23.678
Being a fan of zombie
lore, I get it.

20:24.131 --> 20:25.933
But what's the appeal
of being a zombie?

20:26.251 --> 20:27.061
Like look at this guy.

20:27.618 --> 20:29.422
Who would want to be
alive in a decayed,

20:29.438 --> 20:30.521
mindless state?

20:31.189 --> 20:33.408
Being a vampire...
that I understand.

20:33.507 --> 20:35.761
That's the romantic
route to immortality.

20:35.849 --> 20:37.966
The, uh, gentlemen's
monster, as it were.

20:38.009 --> 20:38.994
Speaking of monsters,

20:38.995 --> 20:40.878
none of these zombies
match the photo

20:40.879 --> 20:41.897
of our killer.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.305
Maybe he's trying
out a new look.

20:44.135 --> 20:44.802
How about you?

20:45.053 --> 20:46.868
If you could be any supernatural
creature, what would it be?

20:46.883 --> 20:48.379
Van Helsing. No question.

20:49.361 --> 20:51.149
Monster slayer. Befitting.

20:51.733 --> 20:52.476
And imagine,

20:53.177 --> 20:54.659
the monster that we are hunting

20:54.660 --> 20:57.158
might be in this very room.

20:58.406 --> 21:00.052
All right, ladies,
thanks for your help.

21:02.132 --> 21:03.474
I don't know about those
shoes with that top.

21:04.215 --> 21:06.112
I'm just sayin'.
I'd have went open-toed.

21:06.671 --> 21:08.091
Are you guys having
more luck than we are?

21:08.152 --> 21:08.807
Not at all.

21:09.191 --> 21:10.265
Oh, and guess what.

21:10.513 --> 21:12.466
None of these knuckleheads
are real zombies.

21:12.908 --> 21:14.605
I think what my colleague
means to say is

21:14.606 --> 21:16.592
that no one recognized our
zombie from the video

21:16.593 --> 21:17.742
or our victim David Lock.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.522
If David wasn't a part
of the zombie crowd,

21:20.523 --> 21:22.256
then what was he
doing down there?

21:22.934 --> 21:24.537
He definitely wasn't
part of our group,

21:24.538 --> 21:25.296
I can tell you that.

21:25.829 --> 21:28.161
What about you?
Do you recognize him.

21:29.548 --> 21:30.264
What?

21:31.850 --> 21:33.612
Paul, are you high right now?

21:34.231 --> 21:36.374
Whoa. Whoa. Hey now.

21:36.605 --> 21:38.161
Uh... where's that...

21:39.435 --> 21:40.233
coming from?

21:40.352 --> 21:43.073
No. No, of course not.

21:45.793 --> 21:46.516
Hello.

21:47.830 --> 21:48.730
Right. Um...

21:51.502 --> 21:53.607
Yeah, yeah, I-I don't
know this dude.

21:53.608 --> 21:55.346
He's not a-a zombie

21:55.347 --> 21:56.900
or a-a normal.

21:58.590 --> 21:59.294
Listen,

22:00.054 --> 22:01.344
will this take much longer?

22:01.345 --> 22:02.486
I have a class in the morning.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.376
- You're a student?
- A teacher.

22:04.553 --> 22:05.207
Really?

22:05.395 --> 22:07.236
Assistant professor
of anthropology.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.688
I believe our fascination
with zombies

22:09.689 --> 22:11.188
is a cultural phenomenon,

22:11.787 --> 22:14.405
a commentary on the inner
numbness of modern life.

22:14.406 --> 22:15.170
Yeah, okay.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.488
Do either of you recognize this,

22:17.921 --> 22:19.333
uh, zombie?

22:20.497 --> 22:21.271
That's Kyle.

22:22.456 --> 22:23.237
Kyle Jennings.

22:26.275 --> 22:27.617
NYPD! Kyle Jennings!

22:33.363 --> 22:33.975
Is that him?

22:35.217 --> 22:36.449
Yeah, that's him.

22:38.429 --> 22:39.180
Kyle.

22:46.078 --> 22:46.695
He's dead.

22:48.205 --> 22:49.439
So do we have cause of death?

22:50.096 --> 22:52.799
I assume by "we," you mean me.

22:53.048 --> 22:55.084
I'll have answers
after I cut him open.

22:55.811 --> 22:56.501
Charming.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.766
We're all meat, Castle.
Get over it.

23:00.133 --> 23:03.218
What I can tell you is, his
teeth match the bite marks,

23:03.219 --> 23:05.363
and the blood on his clothes
came from the victim.

23:05.364 --> 23:06.901
Kyle Jennings is your killer.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.492
Well, the question
is, who killed him?

23:09.633 --> 23:11.093
Isn't that always the question?

23:11.885 --> 23:13.423
Uh, you know, just...

23:13.424 --> 23:14.270
What is it, Castle?

23:14.271 --> 23:16.193
No, I was just wondering,

23:16.802 --> 23:19.985
before this man died, he was
behaving exactly like a zombie.

23:19.986 --> 23:22.658
Is there any medical
way to determine...

23:23.117 --> 23:25.195
if he actually was...

23:27.741 --> 23:28.488
one?

23:29.387 --> 23:30.766
W- w-why is he in my morgue?

23:30.941 --> 23:32.724
There are no zombies, Castle.

23:33.098 --> 23:35.029
This is a man.
He was a live man.

23:35.130 --> 23:36.182
Now he's a dead man.

23:36.550 --> 23:38.149
End of story.

23:45.760 --> 23:46.464
It's undead!

23:49.432 --> 23:50.901
Castle, call for backup!

23:53.267 --> 23:54.179
How... how do I...

23:54.180 --> 23:54.979
9. 9.

23:54.980 --> 23:55.661
9.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.253
Is there a police code
for zombie on the loose?

24:04.564 --> 24:06.988
So based on the latest
report from the ER,

24:07.167 --> 24:09.260
Kyle Jennings was
transferred up to ICU.

24:09.261 --> 24:10.937
He is stable but under sedation.

24:10.938 --> 24:12.311
I'm telling you,
that guy was dead.

24:12.594 --> 24:14.593
Remind me never to choke on a
chicken bone in front of you.

24:14.660 --> 24:16.955
Hey, you checked that guy.
So did the paramedics.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.428
Whoa. You guys, I'm sure

24:18.429 --> 24:20.222
that there's a medical
explanation for it.

24:20.300 --> 24:21.866
Oh, there's an
explanation, all right.

24:21.867 --> 24:23.010
Besides that one.

24:23.014 --> 24:24.482
Come on. You were there.
You saw it.

24:24.483 --> 24:25.757
He rose from the dead.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.698
He didn't rise from
the dead, Castle.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.327
He wasn't dead in
the first place.

24:29.328 --> 24:31.083
Yeah, he's not a zombie, Castle.

24:31.452 --> 24:32.548
He's just a murderer.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.116
Well, then what was his
motive for murder,

24:35.214 --> 24:36.584
detective Esposito?

24:38.704 --> 24:39.829
Kyle sold insurance.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.118
He had no criminal record.

24:41.119 --> 24:42.953
There's no evidence he
even knew our victim.

24:43.154 --> 24:45.447
He's a human killer
with a human motive.

24:45.448 --> 24:47.617
Or he's a zombie killer
with a zombie motive.

24:49.587 --> 24:50.164
Beckett.

24:50.803 --> 24:51.717
Tasty brains.

24:52.655 --> 24:53.540
You know, Castle, do
you really believe

24:53.541 --> 24:54.616
in all this zombie
stuff, because I...

24:54.617 --> 24:57.555
I would swear on my nana's grave
that Kyle Jennings was dead.

24:58.515 --> 24:59.249
No.

24:59.760 --> 25:00.806
You know what I do believe in?

25:01.739 --> 25:03.136
Driving Beckett crazy.

25:04.982 --> 25:06.637
I have to say, it's
good to see you guys

25:06.638 --> 25:07.483
hitting it off again.

25:09.001 --> 25:10.397
Well, Castle, looks like
we will get our motive

25:10.398 --> 25:11.456
straight from the source.

25:11.457 --> 25:13.641
Mr. Kyle Jennings is
officially awake.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.467
Kyle, I'm detective Beckett.
This is Mr. Castle.

25:19.693 --> 25:21.581
What am I doing here?
Why are there cops outside?

25:21.582 --> 25:23.054
No one's telling me anything.

25:23.407 --> 25:24.458
What, was I mugged or something?

25:24.598 --> 25:26.767
We need to ask you a few
questions about David Lock.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.451
- Who?
- This man.

25:30.926 --> 25:31.432
I don't know him.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.278
Two nights ago, he
went on a zombie walk.

25:33.279 --> 25:34.442
Did the two of you meet there?

25:34.568 --> 25:35.928
I'm telling you, I've never
seen the guy before.

25:35.929 --> 25:36.758
What is this about?

25:37.500 --> 25:38.268
He was murdered.

25:39.516 --> 25:40.279
Beaten to death.

25:44.747 --> 25:46.276
What happened at
that zombie walk?

25:47.663 --> 25:48.379
I can't remember.

25:49.139 --> 25:50.644
Well, what's the last
thing you do remember?

25:51.778 --> 25:54.091
Uh, I...
got dressed to head over there.

25:55.574 --> 25:57.529
The next thing I know, I
woke up in the morgue.

25:57.847 --> 25:59.141
Did you drink or do
drugs that night?

25:59.153 --> 26:01.188
I don't do that stuff. Look...

26:01.756 --> 26:02.947
I didn't hurt anyone, okay?

26:02.948 --> 26:03.956
I would never do that.

26:05.195 --> 26:07.365
I just... I don't
remember anything.

26:08.164 --> 26:09.139
Well, the victim's blood

26:09.179 --> 26:10.533
was found on your clothes,

26:10.893 --> 26:12.202
bite marks match your teeth,

26:12.274 --> 26:14.260
the cuff of your shirt was
clutched in his hand,

26:14.261 --> 26:16.669
and a security camera
caught our killer on tape.

26:17.402 --> 26:18.274
Is that you, Kyle?

26:24.975 --> 26:25.594
Yes.

26:26.820 --> 26:27.617
That's me.

26:32.235 --> 26:33.391
I think you're gonna
need a lawyer.

26:38.899 --> 26:42.095
So Kyle killed someone he
never met for no reason.

26:42.096 --> 26:43.338
Is that what we're
supposed to believe?

26:43.339 --> 26:45.161
Well, isn't that what
you said zombies do?

26:45.356 --> 26:47.138
It is with a sad
heart, I say that

26:47.139 --> 26:48.392
that man is no zombie.

26:48.494 --> 26:50.037
Oh, even though he
rose from the dead?

26:50.569 --> 26:52.117
It's common knowledge, when
you turn into a zombie,

26:52.118 --> 26:52.990
you cannot turn back.

26:52.991 --> 26:54.292
So you concede to the fact that

26:54.293 --> 26:55.953
there's a medical
explanation to all of this?

26:55.954 --> 26:58.055
I concede to nothing

26:58.064 --> 27:00.417
except that Kyle is not
telling us the whole story.

27:00.418 --> 27:01.483
You think he remembers?

27:03.560 --> 27:05.659
When a life-altering
moment occurs,

27:06.587 --> 27:07.504
people remember.

27:11.399 --> 27:13.058
Well, maybe it's too
big to deal with.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.015
Maybe he...

27:16.408 --> 27:17.480
can't face it just yet.

27:18.823 --> 27:19.999
Well, you think he ever will be?

27:20.724 --> 27:21.410
Hopefully,

27:22.056 --> 27:22.950
if he feels safe.

27:23.462 --> 27:24.348
Perlmutter?

27:25.999 --> 27:26.910
What are you doing here?

27:27.357 --> 27:30.933
I came to tend to one of my
patients... Kyle Jennings.

27:32.666 --> 27:34.621
Do you think that's a good idea?

27:34.622 --> 27:36.333
I'll have you know,
I'm perfectly capable

27:36.455 --> 27:37.915
of treating living patients.

27:37.916 --> 27:39.344
I simply prefer not to.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.829
I made an exception here

27:40.830 --> 27:44.017
because the results of his
blood work are quite unusual.

27:44.062 --> 27:44.714
What do you mean?

27:44.777 --> 27:47.321
Kyle Jennings had
scopolamine in his system,

27:47.490 --> 27:51.016
which, in small doses, is used
to treat motion sickness.

27:51.236 --> 27:54.192
In larger doses, it acts on
the central nervous system

27:54.193 --> 27:57.364
to promote compliant and
suggestible behavior.

27:57.833 --> 28:00.069
Exactly how suggestible?

28:00.128 --> 28:01.638
You'll basically do
whatever you're told.

28:02.328 --> 28:03.865
It's like a date-rape drug,

28:03.866 --> 28:05.651
only the victim
remains conscious.

28:06.126 --> 28:07.860
And when the drug wears off,

28:08.309 --> 28:10.025
you have no recollection
of what happened.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.471
Is it possible somebody
slipped Kyle that drug?

28:12.577 --> 28:14.383
I think it's highly
probable that they did.

28:14.459 --> 28:16.577
What time do you think he
was given the scopolamine?

28:16.787 --> 28:20.198
Between 2:45 and 3:45 the
night of the murder.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.713
That's when he was
on that zombie walk.

28:21.944 --> 28:24.160
Someone on the zombie
walk drugged Kyle

28:24.161 --> 28:25.428
and sent him after David.

28:25.957 --> 28:26.874
Kyle's innocent.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.756
Far from a random active

28:33.927 --> 28:35.220
of zombie mayhem,

28:35.221 --> 28:37.315
this murder was
fiendishly deliberate.

28:37.316 --> 28:38.438
It was meticulously planned...

28:38.439 --> 28:40.801
By someone with a
powerful motive...

28:40.898 --> 28:42.062
With access to those drugs...

28:42.091 --> 28:43.686
Who was also at our zombie walk.

28:43.687 --> 28:44.835
But we interviewed those people.

28:44.836 --> 28:46.317
There's no evidence that
David knew any of them

28:46.318 --> 28:47.887
or had anything to do
with the zombie scene.

28:47.901 --> 28:49.094
Well, we know he was down there.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.584
He had to have gone
there for a reason.

28:50.674 --> 28:52.834
Maybe our best bet is to work
this through the drug angle.

28:52.835 --> 28:54.029
Uh, I got started on that,

28:54.030 --> 28:56.368
and I did some research
on scopolamine.

28:56.369 --> 28:57.720
- Nice.
- Quite the list of side effects,

28:57.721 --> 28:59.663
including drowsiness,
confusion, slurred speech,

28:59.781 --> 29:00.540
death.

29:00.541 --> 29:01.604
Is it available on the street?

29:01.605 --> 29:03.495
It's uncommon, but it's
out there, and get this...

29:03.542 --> 29:06.087
users refer to it as
"the zombie drug."

29:06.988 --> 29:09.829
And I know just the zombie
to tell us all about it.

29:12.916 --> 29:15.232
Hey, what is this?
I answered all your guys' questions.

29:15.233 --> 29:16.912
When you were here last
time, what were you on?

29:18.574 --> 29:19.254
On?

29:20.248 --> 29:21.681
What do you... what do you mean?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.776
You were under the
influence, Paul.

29:23.856 --> 29:25.933
Heavily under the influence.

29:26.622 --> 29:27.726
Was it scopolamine?

29:27.727 --> 29:28.551
Whoa. What now?

29:28.637 --> 29:30.631
Do you use the zombie drug?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.122
I suppose that's...

29:33.877 --> 29:34.894
possible.

29:34.979 --> 29:36.545
Do any of the other
zombies use it?

29:36.546 --> 29:37.428
Some do.

29:38.481 --> 29:40.721
Some say it enhances
the zombie experience.

29:41.021 --> 29:41.900
Where did you get it?

29:42.491 --> 29:43.773
A guy down there
sells the stuff.

29:43.774 --> 29:44.630
Who? What's his name?

29:44.641 --> 29:45.972
I don't know. I never asked.

29:45.973 --> 29:46.975
Well, describe him.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.162
Dark hair, tall, over 6'.

29:51.130 --> 29:51.932
Is this him?

29:54.757 --> 29:55.584
Yeah, that's him.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.351
Thanks for coming in again, Tom.

29:58.457 --> 30:00.765
Sure. Though I'm not
sure what I can do.

30:00.766 --> 30:01.859
I heard you caught the guy.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.335
Yeah, well, we just
needed you to help us

30:03.336 --> 30:04.935
tie up a few loose ends.

30:05.064 --> 30:07.688
So this is our suspect...
Kyle Jennings.

30:07.861 --> 30:09.274
Yeah, I remember from last time.

30:09.350 --> 30:11.366
Now you said that you've
never seen him before.

30:11.468 --> 30:13.476
Well...
he'd be hard to miss, right?

30:13.841 --> 30:15.882
Yeah, that's funny, 'cause
Kyle said he saw you.

30:16.202 --> 30:18.216
Yeah, he says you were
at the zombie walk.

30:18.287 --> 30:20.691
You never told us that you were a
part of the zombie subculture.

30:21.337 --> 30:22.966
Detective, I'm pre-law.

30:22.967 --> 30:24.925
I- I have no time for
regular culture,

30:24.926 --> 30:26.117
let alone subculture.

30:26.154 --> 30:27.372
Oh, Tom, you're too modest.

30:27.430 --> 30:29.149
A number of zombies
sang your praises.

30:29.226 --> 30:31.062
Yeah, apparently,
you're the go-to guy

30:31.063 --> 30:34.229
for the real zombie experience
with the scopolamine.

30:35.856 --> 30:36.675
The what?

30:36.758 --> 30:38.981
You're a kid from
Ridgewood, Tom.

30:38.982 --> 30:40.531
You don't even have a job.

30:40.738 --> 30:44.063
And yet, you manage to afford
a really nice apartment

30:44.680 --> 30:46.457
and you're able to
pay your tuition.

30:46.458 --> 30:47.720
I- I took out student loans.

30:48.909 --> 30:49.767
Look...

30:50.108 --> 30:52.287
I'm... I'm... I'm not a drug dealer.

30:52.354 --> 30:53.782
You're trying to get ahead.

30:54.137 --> 30:56.026
You know, make a
life with Greta.

30:56.095 --> 30:58.438
And then she steps out with
some Wall Street douche

30:58.440 --> 31:00.420
who just would not let her go.

31:00.583 --> 31:03.047
David wanted to see Greta the
night that he was killed.

31:03.235 --> 31:04.211
She said no.

31:04.934 --> 31:06.152
We canvassed the area.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.107
He was seen sitting in his car
outside of your apartment.

31:09.156 --> 31:10.000
When you left that night,

31:10.001 --> 31:11.502
he followed you to
the zombie walk.

31:11.531 --> 31:13.396
I'm betting he told you he
was gonna fight for Greta.

31:13.442 --> 31:15.272
He was handsome, he had money,

31:15.485 --> 31:16.722
the two of them had a history.

31:16.723 --> 31:17.946
I mean, you knew you
couldn't compete.

31:18.030 --> 31:19.371
Yeah, especially if
David told Greta

31:19.372 --> 31:21.191
you're nothing but a
low-life drug dealer.

31:21.716 --> 31:23.538
You had to take matters
into your own hands.

31:23.629 --> 31:26.070
Or more specifically,
Kyle's hands.

31:26.125 --> 31:27.946
So you had this brilliant plan.

31:28.141 --> 31:30.287
You dosed Kyle with scopolamine,

31:30.288 --> 31:31.667
told him to kill David,

31:31.909 --> 31:33.814
thinking, nobody will
ever figure it out.

31:34.282 --> 31:36.542
Actually, that last part
didn't work out so well.

31:36.543 --> 31:37.168
Yeah.

31:41.699 --> 31:42.510
All you have

31:43.429 --> 31:45.503
is the word of a few
whacked out zombies.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.951
That's not even close
to probable cause.

31:49.415 --> 31:52.302
Yeah, well, it's all I need to
keep you here for 24 hours.

31:52.807 --> 31:53.550
And by then,

31:54.027 --> 31:55.233
I will have my proof.

31:58.281 --> 31:59.054
No, you won't.

32:03.459 --> 32:05.339
He's right. We've got nothing.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.804
"Nothing" is a strong word.

32:07.963 --> 32:11.424
The only person that can link
Tom to the killing is Kyle,

32:11.425 --> 32:13.335
and he doesn't
remember anything.

32:13.575 --> 32:14.937
And on top of all of that,

32:15.475 --> 32:18.116
the evidence shows that Kyle
alone committed the murder.

32:18.678 --> 32:20.296
Well, when you put it like that...

32:21.336 --> 32:22.567
yes, it sounds a little bleak.

32:24.691 --> 32:25.582
Maybe this is it,

32:26.394 --> 32:28.484
what every homicide cop fears.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.593
The perfect murder.

32:31.697 --> 32:34.564
No. This is not the
perfect murder.

32:34.565 --> 32:35.732
- Can't be.
- It happens.

32:35.746 --> 32:37.677
Not to me.
Not unless I've written it.

32:37.678 --> 32:38.956
No, we're just
missing something.

32:38.957 --> 32:39.781
Like proof.

32:40.275 --> 32:41.918
Without it, we did the
only thing we could.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.768
We went at Tom head-on.
He didn't blink.

32:44.488 --> 32:45.400
We're out of moves.

32:47.260 --> 32:48.216
We got one move left.

32:50.021 --> 32:51.665
We went at Tom head-on.

32:52.254 --> 32:53.935
Now we need to go
at him sideways.

32:55.263 --> 32:56.364
And I know just what to do.

33:03.397 --> 33:04.791
Greta, I know how you feel.

33:04.792 --> 33:05.868
You're in love with Tom,

33:05.869 --> 33:07.638
and you want to see
the best in him.

33:07.639 --> 33:09.306
But you have to
look at the facts

33:09.307 --> 33:10.404
what you're saying isn't true.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.534
Okay? None of it is.

33:12.233 --> 33:13.211
Well, then take the money.

33:14.162 --> 33:16.895
How is he able to pay for
an apartment in Manhattan?

33:16.896 --> 33:18.943
Not being a drug dealer,
I'll tell you that much.

33:20.773 --> 33:21.950
What about that engagement ring?

33:23.302 --> 33:24.221
How can he afford that?

33:26.072 --> 33:28.017
He... he said it was
his grandmother's.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.071
Greta, you are my last chance.

33:31.072 --> 33:32.289
If you don't help me,

33:32.590 --> 33:36.197
an innocent man is gonna
go to prison for life

33:37.039 --> 33:38.241
for David's murder.

33:51.215 --> 33:51.875
No.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.218
Tom's the innocent one. Okay?

33:56.223 --> 33:57.950
You got your killer, and
it's not my fiance.

34:08.014 --> 34:09.434
I'm still waiting on
that proof of yours.

34:10.998 --> 34:11.696
No?

34:12.759 --> 34:13.498
Nothing?

34:17.463 --> 34:19.405
Well, thanks for
the hospitality.

34:21.538 --> 34:23.588
Is there a comment
card I could fill out

34:23.589 --> 34:25.533
about the level of
service I received?

34:28.489 --> 34:29.327
You're free to go.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.266
Take advantage while you can.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.706
Yeah, Greta told me about
your little conversation.

34:35.761 --> 34:36.969
That was your big play,

34:37.024 --> 34:38.666
to use my own
fiancee against me?

34:38.668 --> 34:41.429
She's gonna figure out who
you are sooner or later,

34:41.431 --> 34:43.027
so what are you gonna
do about it then?

34:45.413 --> 34:46.405
Kyle Jennings made bail.

34:46.882 --> 34:48.005
Got released a
couple of hours ago.

34:48.005 --> 34:48.895
Wait. Kyle is out?

34:49.062 --> 34:51.329
His bail was set at $1 million.
Where'd he get the money?

34:51.409 --> 34:53.447
Turns out he's got an uncle
who's got some serious dough.

34:53.447 --> 34:55.112
I'd steer clear of
him if I was you.

34:55.114 --> 34:56.601
What kind of lies
did you tell him?

34:56.603 --> 34:59.403
We didn't tell him anything,
but Kyle's a smart guy.

34:59.865 --> 35:00.803
He's gonna do the math.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.657
I want police protection.

35:02.816 --> 35:04.200
I thought you didn't
do anything wrong.

35:04.261 --> 35:07.298
I didn't, but thanks to you,
Kyle thinks that I did,

35:07.299 --> 35:08.311
and now he's out there.

35:12.592 --> 35:14.665
Y- you're releasing me with
knowledge and forethought

35:14.666 --> 35:15.711
that he could attack me.

35:16.361 --> 35:17.090
If he does,

35:18.232 --> 35:20.258
think about the lawsuit
I'll file against you.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.416
Detective Esposito, please
process Mr. Williams

35:27.417 --> 35:30.033
and then escort him to his
apartment, make sure it's clear,

35:30.034 --> 35:32.464
and then after that,
you are on your own.

35:36.611 --> 35:38.461
I'll be sure to check
"excellent service"

35:38.462 --> 35:39.576
on that comment card.

36:04.323 --> 36:05.898
I want a patrol car
outside the building.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.713
Yeah, well, that's
not gonna happen.

36:09.047 --> 36:10.255
I'm gonna come over
and let you...

36:10.287 --> 36:10.865
Aah!

36:11.234 --> 36:12.650
Get down! Stay in the car.

36:13.618 --> 36:15.848
NYPD! Drop that bat and
show me your hands.

36:27.230 --> 36:28.235
I know what you did to me.

36:28.236 --> 36:29.509
No, I didn't. I-I didn't.

36:29.510 --> 36:32.024
You made me kill a man and now
I'm gonna do the same to you!

36:32.025 --> 36:33.183
Kyle, no, please. I...

36:34.037 --> 36:34.925
I'm very sorry.

36:34.977 --> 36:35.589
You're lying.

36:35.590 --> 36:36.923
No, I am. I swear.

36:37.494 --> 36:38.882
He was gonna take
Greta away from me.

36:38.883 --> 36:39.892
I had to do something.

36:41.956 --> 36:42.939
I'm sorry I used you.

36:44.424 --> 36:46.196
Just please don't...

36:46.600 --> 36:47.840
please don't... don't hurt me.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.228
Okay. Enough.

36:59.505 --> 37:01.543
Good actor, huh?
I had you going.

37:01.658 --> 37:03.381
Tom Williams, you
are under arrest

37:03.387 --> 37:04.979
for the murder of David Lock.

37:04.980 --> 37:05.884
Wait. Hang on a second.

37:05.885 --> 37:07.055
Just... Kyle.

37:09.673 --> 37:10.634
What... Kyle?

37:14.881 --> 37:15.650
Sorry.

37:16.308 --> 37:17.679
Kyle couldn't make it.

37:18.091 --> 37:19.145
But he, uh...

37:19.391 --> 37:20.434
sends his regards.

37:20.987 --> 37:21.923
Turn around.

37:22.174 --> 37:22.968
Turn around.

37:24.585 --> 37:25.461
I'm gotta tell you, bro,

37:25.879 --> 37:26.905
you coming at me like that...

37:28.118 --> 37:29.418
you almost made me a believer.

37:32.898 --> 37:33.716
Stop it.

37:34.540 --> 37:35.276
Don't do that.

37:36.557 --> 37:37.510
You're creeping me out.

37:42.698 --> 37:43.919
Ah, you really nailed it, Kyle.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.884
Your costume is
what sold that bit.

37:45.906 --> 37:47.176
Yeah, and by helping us,

37:47.177 --> 37:48.564
you've actually helped yourself.

37:49.230 --> 37:50.146
The DA is looking into

37:50.147 --> 37:51.750
dismissing the
charges against you

37:51.751 --> 37:53.069
now that he has
Tom's confession.

37:54.997 --> 37:56.434
Detective, Mr. Castle,

37:56.435 --> 37:58.129
I- I don't know how
to thank you...

37:58.130 --> 38:00.944
Uh, let me borrow
the zombie outfit

38:00.945 --> 38:02.724
for another day,
we'll call it even.

38:04.462 --> 38:05.372
You know what? Keep it.

38:06.408 --> 38:07.829
My zombie walking days are over.

38:08.007 --> 38:10.451
I just...
want to put all this behind me.

38:19.749 --> 38:21.713
How does somebody put something
like that behind them?

38:23.686 --> 38:24.825
He's gonna need therapy.

38:25.399 --> 38:26.061
It helps.

38:28.672 --> 38:30.256
At first he won't even
be able to deal with it.

38:30.257 --> 38:32.098
It's gonna take
everything that he's got

38:32.099 --> 38:34.032
to just put one foot
in front of the other

38:34.033 --> 38:35.028
and get through the day.

38:37.865 --> 38:39.173
I didn't know you were
seeing a therapist.

38:39.467 --> 38:42.063
Yeah, well, I didn't want
to make any excuses.

38:42.064 --> 38:43.981
I just wanted to...
put in the time

38:44.315 --> 38:45.166
and do the work.

38:45.913 --> 38:48.473
But I think I'm almost
where I want to be now.

38:50.649 --> 38:52.221
And... where is that?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.105
In a place where I
can finally accept

38:57.106 --> 38:58.628
everything that
happened that day.

39:02.072 --> 39:02.830
Everything.

39:05.503 --> 39:06.233
I think...

39:07.119 --> 39:08.033
I understand.

39:08.732 --> 39:11.919
And, um, that wall that I
was telling you about...

39:14.280 --> 39:15.391
I think it's coming down.

39:17.639 --> 39:19.089
Well, I'd like to be
there when it does.

39:19.659 --> 39:21.007
Yeah, I'd like you
to be there, too.

39:21.269 --> 39:22.891
- Only without the zombie makeup.
- I don't know.

39:22.923 --> 39:25.181
I kind of think that the zombie
makeup suits you, Castle.

39:25.243 --> 39:26.197
Yeah, I make it work.

39:29.129 --> 39:29.871
Tomorrow?

39:32.192 --> 39:33.003
Tomorrow.

40:12.674 --> 40:13.587
Victory is mine.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.984
1,000...

40:17.679 --> 40:18.646
points.

40:18.771 --> 40:20.741
And that is the icing

40:21.403 --> 40:23.182
on the cake that
has been my day.

40:24.921 --> 40:25.661
That's it?

40:26.936 --> 40:27.821
It's over?

40:32.165 --> 40:33.944
What? Come on, Alexis.

40:33.945 --> 40:34.916
It's just a game.

40:35.375 --> 40:37.168
A game we started when I was five,

40:37.907 --> 40:38.835
and it's over.

40:39.190 --> 40:41.129
And I'm going to graduate,
leave for college,

40:41.130 --> 40:43.085
and I'll be there
and you'll be here,

40:43.525 --> 40:45.344
and we can play at Christmas
and during the summer,

40:45.345 --> 40:47.743
but...
it won't be the same, will it?

40:48.142 --> 40:48.756
No.

40:50.204 --> 40:51.737
But you know what?
Things change.

40:53.099 --> 40:54.589
And change is good.

40:57.146 --> 40:57.999
I can't do it.

40:59.366 --> 41:00.142
Do what?

41:00.332 --> 41:01.522
Go that far away.

41:01.985 --> 41:04.112
I want to go away,
but not that far.

41:04.403 --> 41:06.513
And I hate myself for it,
because my personal motto is,

41:06.514 --> 41:07.568
"do the thing that
you fear the most,"

41:07.569 --> 41:09.793
but every time I get ready
to hit the send button

41:09.794 --> 41:12.099
on my acceptance to
Oxford or Stanford, I...

41:12.456 --> 41:13.658
I get all sick inside.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.488
Well, you... follow your heart.

41:18.613 --> 41:20.010
Follow your heart,
you can't go wrong.

41:23.656 --> 41:24.934
And my heart is telling me...

41:27.045 --> 41:28.075
go to Columbia.

41:29.577 --> 41:32.429
But here's the other
thing... if I do this,

41:32.691 --> 41:34.793
you have to promise
not to drop in on me.

41:34.956 --> 41:35.817
If I do this,

41:36.033 --> 41:37.337
you have to give me my space.

41:39.355 --> 41:40.364
Do you think you can do that?

41:43.381 --> 41:47.388
I think I can give a
sincere and solemn oath

41:48.617 --> 41:49.671
to try.

41:52.313 --> 41:53.097
Then...

41:54.181 --> 41:55.115
best two out of three.

41:58.030 --> 41:58.957
This isn't over.

42:02.708 --> 42:03.723
This isn't over.
