01:56.149 --> 01:57.216
Flight crew.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.618
Have we been cleared
for landing?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.120
Ow! Ow!

02:01.122 --> 02:03.155
No, no, no. No signal yet.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.490
Carry on.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.825
We should be arriving
in althurbar soon.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.193
What's our eta?

02:08.195 --> 02:09.728
Uh, eta?

02:09.729 --> 02:12.831
Yes, sir.
Two milliseconds, captain.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.534
I think... Look!

02:15.536 --> 02:18.003
It's a trachlonian
transpacial cruiser.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.204
Far out!

02:19.206 --> 02:20.405
Copy it! Copy it!

02:29.517 --> 02:32.584
Making miniature confederation
ships again, huh?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.720
Um, well, yes, sir.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.589
Let me see.

02:37.591 --> 02:41.193
We've almost got the
whole collection now.

02:47.734 --> 02:51.036
Clear for landing.
Docking platform 253b.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.339
Your excellencies, we have
been cleared for landing.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.275
<i>Well done, admiral.</i>

02:58.212 --> 02:59.678
What's happening?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.947
Sorry, admiral.
We've been hit by,

03:01.949 --> 03:04.082
uh, them.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.785
What in the universe are those
little annoying green

03:06.787 --> 03:09.821
second-class aliens
doing around althurbar

03:09.823 --> 03:11.390
during this celebration?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.492
Don't tell me someone
invited the

03:13.494 --> 03:14.493
invas.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.894
Captain, I can't be sure,

03:15.896 --> 03:18.830
but I think they said,
"cleared to land."

03:18.832 --> 03:20.666
Good. Steady now.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.900
Let's bring her in.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.218
You must be pulling my legs.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.652
What in the name
of all the seven

03:40.654 --> 03:43.388
intergalactic divas
is this about?

03:45.592 --> 03:47.025
Hmm!

03:48.495 --> 03:50.262
Tell me, sweeties.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.798
Shouldn't you be
away on this long

03:52.800 --> 03:56.668
super-far and oh, so
important mission?

03:56.670 --> 03:59.271
Well, we finished a
little ahead of schedule.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.572
But you didn't have to,

04:00.574 --> 04:03.275
you know, make such
a big fuss for us.

04:15.221 --> 04:17.990
<i>- Please welcome governors.
- Hur and mennis,</i>

04:17.992 --> 04:21.959
<i>who will kick off our celebration
of 100 cycles of peace.</i>

04:22.662 --> 04:23.795
Pardon me.

04:23.797 --> 04:27.666
I always cry in 100 cycles
of peace celebrations.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.436
Hello.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.639
What? You've got to be joking.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.308
What do you mean it's
not working, darling?

04:36.310 --> 04:38.343
It should've been
ready yesterday.

04:38.345 --> 04:42.047
I'm coming up there
in 3.5 seconds.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.585
Me, me, me! Why me?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.553
These underpaid martians
don't know the difference

04:48.555 --> 04:52.190
between a state celebration
and a tailgate barbeque.

04:52.192 --> 04:55.527
And you, little jelly-bugs,
are coming with me.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.597
If I let you invas in
for just a second,

04:58.599 --> 05:00.999
this celebration is doomed.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.108
Whoa! Wow!

05:10.110 --> 05:12.411
Paladin robots? Incredible!

05:12.413 --> 05:13.779
Don't touch them.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.315
They're relics.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.819
Are they the real thing?
Real, honey?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.621
These are the
only remaining robots

05:22.623 --> 05:23.855
from the great war.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.957
It was on special
request of governor hur

05:25.959 --> 05:28.427
that we set them up
here for all to see.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.962
Do they still work?
Are they functional?

05:30.964 --> 05:33.999
Frankly, my dear,
why do you care at all?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.300
Of course they don't.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.135
They're de-energized.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.905
Non-functional.<i> Finito.</i> Kaput.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.474
Which means it's
basically for decoration.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.942
Sir, the fireworks are ready,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.377
but there seems
to be a little glitch

05:45.379 --> 05:46.745
with the remote control.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.915
My gosh, this is so
beneath my pay grade.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.084
Do I look like an electrician?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.053
Chop, chop. Fix it!

05:55.055 --> 05:58.357
Me, me, me! Why me?

06:03.096 --> 06:04.529
Hmm...

06:11.270 --> 06:13.672
Relax, guys. It's stable.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.678
Then whose little alien
finger will push the button?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.346
But, sir, it could be dangerous

06:21.348 --> 06:24.516
to be next to the cannons
when the fireworks go off.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.584
Dangerous?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.018
It'll be dangerous for you

06:27.020 --> 06:28.820
if by the end of
the governor's speech

06:28.822 --> 06:30.422
I don't see that tiny little sky

06:30.424 --> 06:32.924
in there all
puffing and sparkling.

06:32.926 --> 06:34.760
You hear me? How dare you...

06:48.307 --> 06:49.574
Ah!

06:55.315 --> 06:57.983
Hey, a little early
for all this, huh?

06:59.318 --> 07:00.986
Catastrophe.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.288
That's all you invas
are capable of.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.956
Incorrigible peasants.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.858
The interplanetary leaders

07:06.860 --> 07:09.294
will be here for
the celebration.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.996
We can't put them at risk.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.933
But, your excellencies,
we want to stay for the party.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.669
These seven lame brain-munchkins

07:17.671 --> 07:19.571
need to be out of
the planet capital

07:19.573 --> 07:22.174
before they mess up
the entire celebration.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.408
But, sir...

07:24.478 --> 07:25.744
You must understand,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.312
this celebration is not...

07:27.314 --> 07:29.448
You are a menace!

07:29.450 --> 07:30.882
It's not an event
you'll appreciate...

07:30.884 --> 07:32.451
The intergalactic confederation

07:32.453 --> 07:33.718
doesn't need invas...

07:33.720 --> 07:35.353
Sorry, but we
need to ask you to...

07:35.355 --> 07:36.455
Get out!

07:36.457 --> 07:37.823
Understand... Out!

07:37.825 --> 07:38.957
Uh...

07:38.959 --> 07:40.125
Get lost.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.960
If you don't mind.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.528
Sorry, about this.

07:49.368 --> 07:50.936
Talk about overreacting.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.710
I put on my best
uniform for nothing.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.546
What do they think we
could've done wrong?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.120
Congratulations, everyone.

08:09.122 --> 08:12.290
All of you have done
an excellent job.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.426
I'm sure the science jury

08:14.428 --> 08:15.927
is going to take one look,

08:15.929 --> 08:19.664
and agree with me that
you deserve the first prize.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.932
Come, let's go.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.434
We better get moving now

08:22.436 --> 08:25.203
if we want to reach the
space observatory in time.

08:29.809 --> 08:31.543
<i>Gregory!</i>

08:31.545 --> 08:33.578
<i>Gregorio!</i>

08:33.580 --> 08:35.780
<i>Gregorio!</i>

08:35.782 --> 08:38.683
Come on, Phoebe.
Time to get on the bus.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.719
Have you seen my brother?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.721
Fortunately, no.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.768
Hmm.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.304
Gregorio, they're
gonna head out without us.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.772
Big deal.

09:00.774 --> 09:02.974
What's so hot about going
to a space observatory

09:02.976 --> 09:04.776
without taking our telescope?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.912
Ah! Oh, of course.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.814
Observatories usually
don't have telescopes.

09:09.816 --> 09:10.815
Duh.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.251
Not like ours. Here you go.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.319
Ha!

09:14.321 --> 09:15.887
We missed our chance.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.923
Now we'll never
get there in time.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.091
Chill out.
Don't be such a Sheldon.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.161
Your move, mitsue.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.997
Launch the spirit
of zanza, come on!

09:25.999 --> 09:28.833
I'm trying, but this crazy
thing don't wanna...

09:28.835 --> 09:31.002
Come on, mitsue. Do it now.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.105
Rats! My battery is out.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.808
I gotta recharge it.
Later, dudes.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.679
<i>Gregorio!
I don't think it's funny!</i>

09:40.681 --> 09:42.013
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:44.951 --> 09:46.251
Hey?

09:46.253 --> 09:49.087
Our last test with this
machine was a total flop.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.623
Yeah, that was before
I tweaked it a bit.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.758
She's ready now. And the seat?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.427
Where does it come from?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.095
I took it from tank's bike.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.330
He's so out of it,

09:58.332 --> 10:00.432
he left that piece
of junk in my garage

10:00.434 --> 10:02.000
and never came back for it.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.609
Whoa!

10:10.611 --> 10:11.643
Gregory!

10:11.645 --> 10:13.111
Gregory!

10:13.113 --> 10:14.245
Did you hear that?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.580
Gregory, are you nuts?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.782
Give me back my bike seat, man.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.187
Gregory!

10:34.701 --> 10:37.569
Gregory!

10:37.571 --> 10:39.237
<i>Hasta la vista, tanque.</i>

10:43.376 --> 10:44.943
Get out.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.444
You, like, got a photo
with the Justin brothers?

10:46.446 --> 10:48.179
Nobody gets close to them.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.147
Hot!

10:49.149 --> 10:51.282
That's why I left in my camera.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.384
If I'd posted it online,

10:52.386 --> 10:54.519
you would have said
it was Photoshop.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.154
Mary Anne, are you nuts?

10:56.156 --> 10:58.123
Taking this camera on the trip?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.958
You might just lose that pic.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.394
<i>Gregorio!</i>

11:13.072 --> 11:14.272
Ah!

11:22.916 --> 11:24.315
Whoa!

11:26.085 --> 11:29.721
Dudes, I'm telling you.
The truth's out there.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.357
Yeah, right there on Wikipedia.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.858
Oh, come on, banana.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.894
The alien from roswell?

11:35.896 --> 11:39.531
But they're close
and always watching us.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.705
Huh? Mmm.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.308
Let's go, we'll miss the bus.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.945
Agent mulder here can take
his own flying saucer.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.149
Ah! Ah!

11:59.486 --> 12:02.320
It's not working.
Wait. It has to warm up.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.056
You just wait!

12:06.592 --> 12:07.892
Huh? Huh?

12:13.632 --> 12:15.100
Ah!

12:35.254 --> 12:39.557
One day... one day I'm gonna
show you that they are among us

12:39.559 --> 12:42.761
and they are light-years
smarter than you goat-heads.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.544
I bet you didn't know they trim
their bangs every two weeks.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.080
I'll give it back later.
Hey, are you crazy?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.249
Give me back my camera!

13:04.251 --> 13:06.217
Gregory! Come back!

13:11.190 --> 13:14.125
<i>Gregorio, you are very late!</i>

13:14.127 --> 13:16.227
Wow. You sure know
how to make friends.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.367
No!

13:22.369 --> 13:23.434
Whoa!

13:44.590 --> 13:45.857
Whoa!

13:48.527 --> 13:49.594
Whoa.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.004
Huh?

14:08.180 --> 14:10.315
Give me back my camera! Whoa!

14:18.858 --> 14:20.525
That's mine!

14:34.473 --> 14:35.773
Hmm.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.517
Relax, we still can fix it.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.496
There's just no way.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.165
You're all a menace
to this school.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.469
But, Ms. clarisse,
this was an accident.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.205
Spilling coffee on my
blouse was an accident.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.807
Tripping off the stairs,
an accident.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.843
But this, this...

15:11.845 --> 15:13.211
This is a disaster!

15:13.213 --> 15:15.480
A hecatomb, a tragedy!

15:15.482 --> 15:18.683
But we were crazy about
going to the observatory.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.285
It ain't fair.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.519
Not fair?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.787
Your little space game

15:22.789 --> 15:24.856
trashed the work of
the entire school.

15:24.858 --> 15:25.957
Ruined.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.092
I'll tell you what's fair.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.395
But, principal, I've
been waiting for this trip

15:30.397 --> 15:32.163
since the beginning of the year.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.498
You don't understand!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.800
The jury will be
coming back in two days

15:35.802 --> 15:39.604
to judge our school's entry,
which is now destroyed.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.272
It's all his fault.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.308
Hey, man! Don't put it on me.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.310
Who cares whose fault it was?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.345
What's fair is that none of you

15:47.347 --> 15:49.113
are going to the observatory.

15:49.115 --> 15:53.117
You'll all stay behind
to rebuild that model.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.419
My mom's gonna kill me.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.255
And I'm gonna kill this moron!

15:57.257 --> 15:59.257
You have until Monday, or...

15:59.259 --> 16:01.092
Just because of this dehydrated

16:01.094 --> 16:02.293
<i>old tapeworm.</i>

16:03.763 --> 16:06.597
Or all of you will be
expelled from the school.

16:13.872 --> 16:15.373
Two days,

16:15.375 --> 16:17.542
that's all the time you
have to rebuild the model.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.978
The prize is in your hands now.

16:23.849 --> 16:25.149
At least we'll spend the weekend

16:25.151 --> 16:27.151
looking at some planets, too.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.654
Ugh.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.190
Awesome, the whole weekend

16:32.192 --> 16:34.826
painting little styrofoam balls.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.562
I never wanted to go on
this lame field trip.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.664
And now I gotta do
extra homework?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.032
Chill out, dudes.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.201
Let's do it quickly
and it'll soon be over.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.404
Far-out, we're gonna spend
the weekend together.

16:48.307 --> 16:51.175
Great, bunch of freaks.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.311
Seeing you all here
at the capital again

16:53.313 --> 16:56.180
makes me very happy.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.916
I can see you're all
thrilled to be here.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.885
We haven't been
together like this

17:00.887 --> 17:02.920
since that movie premiere.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.656
That one with the little guy

17:05.657 --> 17:08.459
with the stretching neck
and the glowing finger.

17:11.464 --> 17:14.598
The confederation has
maintained universal balance

17:14.601 --> 17:17.702
and Harmony for
100 universal cycles.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.037
Psst!

17:19.039 --> 17:20.238
Each day we need

17:20.240 --> 17:22.507
smaller armies
and fewer weapons.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.909
Chocolate. Dandy.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.210
Juice.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.280
Let me try the jalla juice.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.815
There is no try.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.151
We can dedicate more resources

17:33.153 --> 17:35.119
to knowledge and preservation.

17:35.921 --> 17:37.188
He's back!

17:42.995 --> 17:44.695
Don't move.

17:45.564 --> 17:46.697
Behind you.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.099
All of you, freeze.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.507
You're always babbling on
about the same thing.

17:59.545 --> 18:03.381
What you call balance is
nothing but stagnation.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.584
Change is what
this universe needs.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.559
Huh?

18:37.883 --> 18:39.517
If you haven't noticed,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.819
you are all my prisoners now.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.788
I need phone home.

18:46.159 --> 18:49.360
Mennis, your time is over.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.696
Bow to your new leader.

18:53.066 --> 18:55.433
Me, gana gobler.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.506
All interplanetary leaders
are in althurbar, gobler.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.241
Perfect.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.710
<i>Your excellency, a small craft</i>

19:05.712 --> 19:08.446
<i>was seen leaving the
planet in sector delta.</i>

19:08.448 --> 19:10.781
Oh, that's nothing, gobler,

19:10.783 --> 19:13.084
just a few useless invas

19:13.086 --> 19:15.186
that we expelled
from the ceremonies.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.256
But I said, "no one leaves."

19:18.258 --> 19:20.057
They're insignificant.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.726
No one!

19:21.728 --> 19:23.461
Destroy them!

19:28.401 --> 19:31.102
Captain, we're ready
for the optic-stellar jump.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.603
What's our destination?

19:33.305 --> 19:35.573
Take us home, invaxia.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.475
No, no, no.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.643
I don't wanna be explaining

19:38.645 --> 19:41.379
why we didn't stay on althurbar.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.289
Huh?

19:56.094 --> 19:57.161
What the...

19:57.163 --> 19:58.396
We're being attacked.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.064
What'd we do this time?

20:00.066 --> 20:01.832
Being kicked out wasn't enough?

20:16.715 --> 20:19.250
We've been hit in the fuel pipe.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.285
Why'd this have
to happen on my turn?

20:21.287 --> 20:23.187
What should we do, captain?

20:23.189 --> 20:25.389
Give up, wave the white flag.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.731
I don't think they like it.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.436
Press the panic button.

20:38.438 --> 20:40.671
But we don't have
a panic button.

20:50.682 --> 20:51.782
Vanished?

20:51.784 --> 20:54.418
Must have been vaporized
in the attack.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.034
Ha!

21:10.036 --> 21:14.238
Sorry, I can't control
myself with all these toys.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.107
And where were you going?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.009
I was going to take my place.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.578
Ooh. Your place?

21:20.580 --> 21:23.447
Well, there's no
more, "your place."

21:23.449 --> 21:26.050
I don't share power.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.752
But, gobler...

21:27.754 --> 21:29.220
Your highness.

21:29.222 --> 21:31.989
Your highness,
we had an agreement.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.330
<i>Invas spacecraft
eliminated, sir.</i>

21:39.332 --> 21:42.767
Excellent.
We can't leave any open holes.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.970
Hmm, invas...

21:50.642 --> 21:52.376
<i>It's impressive, folks,</i>

21:52.378 --> 21:55.880
<i>he avoids one, then two,
but then splat.</i>

21:55.882 --> 21:58.849
<i>Not able to avoid crashing
into an asteroid.</i>

21:58.851 --> 22:01.619
Could someone please turn off
little El michels here?

22:01.621 --> 22:03.654
Ah, Gregory, stop
your ragging, huh?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.623
Give me the joystick.

22:05.625 --> 22:09.393
Hello, weirdos? We're not in this
mess to play video games, remember?

22:09.395 --> 22:11.896
You guys said it was
your last turn.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.130
Now it is.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.099
Chill out, mitsue.
It'll be quick.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.300
The dude's a loser.

22:16.302 --> 22:17.568
Huh?

22:17.570 --> 22:19.103
Whoa!

22:19.105 --> 22:21.205
Really? Turn down the TV!

22:21.207 --> 22:22.506
Are you guys deaf?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.909
That was not the video game.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.544
Huh?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.915
I swear it wasn't me.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.793
Awesome.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.128
What is it?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.530
Looks like something
from an amusement park.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.466
Yeah, from the last century.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.501
Judging from
the smoke coming out.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.136
You think somebody's inside?

22:52.138 --> 22:53.904
I knew this was gonna happen.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.540
Can't you see? It's an invasion!

22:56.542 --> 22:59.844
That's a ufo! A flying saucer!

23:00.612 --> 23:02.313
A flying saucer?

23:02.315 --> 23:05.383
Okay, and I'm the lead
singer from iron medal.

23:36.548 --> 23:39.717
O-m-g, what is this?

23:41.887 --> 23:44.789
Don't touch them,
they might be radioactive.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.590
Ahh!

23:46.592 --> 23:49.560
Poor things. They're so cute.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.796
Cute? I'm cute.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.564
They're green!

24:02.507 --> 24:04.642
I am out of here!

24:04.644 --> 24:07.344
I knew there was
intelligent life out there.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.883
Intelligent, huh?

24:12.885 --> 24:16.253
We're from another planet.
We come in peace.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.489
That button you just
pressed, what's it do?

24:18.491 --> 24:20.291
It's our automatic
language translator.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.427
It helps anyone we meet
understand everything we say.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.496
Whoa! With that thing there,

24:25.498 --> 24:29.400
I can totally not flop
on my Spanish test.

24:29.402 --> 24:32.503
We were attacked and
crash-landed on your planet.

24:32.505 --> 24:35.139
Fantastic! A real star war?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.679
No? You got it.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.747
We were lucky that
we didn't disintegrate.

24:43.749 --> 24:46.350
And other aliens,
the ones that attacked you?

24:46.352 --> 24:47.651
What'd they look like?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.553
Do they tentacles
inside their mouths?

24:49.555 --> 24:51.322
Or, I don't know,
a little drooling mouth

24:51.324 --> 24:53.524
inside their mouths that
comes out when they're mad,

24:53.526 --> 24:55.526
and blood like acid?

24:55.528 --> 24:58.929
Or did they hunt you with tiny
laser-sights and then collect your skulls?

24:58.931 --> 25:00.498
Uh...

25:00.500 --> 25:02.633
We don't have
the slightest idea.

25:02.635 --> 25:04.768
Hold on.
It could've been an accident.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.271
Get a load of these computers!

25:07.273 --> 25:09.139
What does this do?

25:09.141 --> 25:12.376
<i>My seven inva captains,
we need your help.</i>

25:12.378 --> 25:15.246
<i>The confederation
celebration was a trap.</i>

25:15.248 --> 25:16.981
<i>We are being attacked.</i>

25:16.983 --> 25:19.950
<i>And the interplanetary leaders
are prisoners here on althurbar.</i>

25:19.952 --> 25:23.287
<i>Find king mnemus
on planet coloccus,</i>

25:23.289 --> 25:25.723
<i>and tell him what has happened.</i>

25:25.725 --> 25:27.591
<i>Help us, seven invas.</i>

25:27.593 --> 25:29.693
<i>You are our only hope.</i>

25:31.897 --> 25:33.964
The whole universe
needs our help,

25:33.966 --> 25:36.567
and we're stuck on
this primitive planet.

25:36.569 --> 25:37.968
Hold on, little creature.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.404
We do have technology here.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.908
Maybe we can even get
your saucer flying again.

25:43.910 --> 25:48.345
Doubt it. Besides the damage,
we also lost all our fuel.

25:48.347 --> 25:51.982
There's nothing to worry about.
My brother will fix it. Me?

25:51.984 --> 25:56.020
We're really good at
building things out of junk.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.789
I mean, not that
your spaceship's junk.

25:58.791 --> 26:01.926
You're right. Maybe it's
not totally trashed.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.160
Get real!

26:03.162 --> 26:05.162
Instead of making planets,
we're gonna become,

26:05.164 --> 26:06.864
like, space mechanics.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.266
Wow!

26:09.268 --> 26:10.868
You make planets?

26:10.870 --> 26:13.003
No. Not like real planets.

26:13.005 --> 26:16.073
I see.
Like these little spaceships?

26:17.442 --> 26:19.076
Get out! You made these?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.412
Yeah, but stuck here,
we can't print anything else.

26:21.414 --> 26:24.648
Looks like we have a really good
reason to help you guys out.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.383
Mmm.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.419
And there goes
Mary Anne basbaum,

26:28.421 --> 26:31.055
adding seven more weirdos
to her b-f-f club.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.124
This is the flight stabilizer.

26:34.126 --> 26:37.027
It spins in the opposite direction
to balance the movements.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.296
I think I know what'll
work as a substitute.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.732
But even if
we replace all the pieces,

26:41.734 --> 26:43.500
what do we do for fuel?

26:43.502 --> 26:45.369
You sure you can't use gasoline?

26:45.371 --> 26:46.670
No.

26:46.672 --> 26:49.940
No one uses those smelly
fossil fuels anymore.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.443
Our engine runs on
a blend of liquid and gas.

26:52.445 --> 26:57.147
We use carbon dioxide mixed with a little
sodium chlorite and phosphoric acid.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.449
Impressive.

26:58.451 --> 27:02.252
A fuel that's a liquid
and a gas at the same time.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.654
That is high-tech!

27:03.656 --> 27:05.289
And that's not all.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.824
This is the best part.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.659
Our liquid-gas
doesn't do anything

27:08.661 --> 27:10.628
until it comes into contact

27:10.630 --> 27:12.363
with this catalyzer pill.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.899
Ooh, mint candy.

27:15.901 --> 27:19.403
It'll be pretty hard finding
something like that here on earth.

27:26.678 --> 27:28.679
Can I take a look?

27:31.616 --> 27:33.450
You won't believe this.

27:39.624 --> 27:42.626
Hey! This is our fuel!

27:42.628 --> 27:44.895
You bet, my little green friend.

27:44.897 --> 27:49.199
Your fuel is gasacola
mixed with mint candy.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.535
Too much sugar
will give you a headache.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.340
Hey you guys. What are we waiting for?
Let's do it!

27:59.477 --> 28:01.045
<i>¶ Check this out, dudes</i>

28:01.047 --> 28:04.581
<i>¶ let me tell you a little story</i>

28:04.583 --> 28:06.150
<i>¶ a spaceship took a thrashing</i>

28:06.152 --> 28:07.885
<i>¶ in an alien Fender bender</i>

28:07.887 --> 28:09.420
<i>¶ the paint-job got all scratchy</i>

28:09.422 --> 28:11.055
<i>¶ "no problem"
said the commander</i>

28:11.057 --> 28:12.623
<i>¶ limping to a custom shop</i>

28:12.625 --> 28:14.158
<i>¶ we took it near the milky way</i>

28:14.160 --> 28:15.959
<i>¶ ain't got no budget to repair</i>

28:15.961 --> 28:17.828
<i>¶ instead of paint
graffiti spray</i>

28:17.830 --> 28:19.630
<i>¶ double power, supercharging</i>

28:19.632 --> 28:21.198
<i>¶ need to jump us to light speed</i>

28:21.200 --> 28:24.201
<i>¶ mold and fit even larger
creature comforts that we need</i>

28:27.772 --> 28:31.408
<i>¶ yeah, my brothers, lay back</i>

28:38.416 --> 28:41.218
<i>¶ horns replaced by subwoofers
headlights by laser beams</i>

28:41.220 --> 28:43.153
<i>¶ like a hot rod flying saucer</i>

28:43.155 --> 28:44.922
<i>¶ way beyond our wildest dreams</i>

28:44.924 --> 28:48.192
<i>¶ now, the gas station we're
pumping found another kind of fuel</i>

28:48.194 --> 28:49.893
<i>¶ when this baby hits a bump</i>

28:49.895 --> 28:52.029
<i>¶ there's no shaking
and it's cool</i>

28:52.031 --> 28:53.297
<i>¶ pedal to the metal</i>

28:53.299 --> 28:54.998
<i>¶ no more time to be marooning</i>

28:55.000 --> 28:56.934
<i>¶ got to get to
where we're going</i>

28:56.936 --> 28:59.002
<i>¶ with the v8 motor tuned</i>

29:00.371 --> 29:01.872
<i>¶ not bad</i>

29:03.308 --> 29:04.908
<i>¶ easy now</i>

29:11.649 --> 29:14.418
<i>¶ this is the intergalactic ride</i>

29:15.253 --> 29:16.787
<i>¶ easy</i>

29:17.322 --> 29:18.756
<i>¶ come on</i>

29:26.798 --> 29:28.165
hmph!

29:28.167 --> 29:30.200
Excellent, who wants
to serve the universe?

29:30.202 --> 29:33.370
If you like, on the way, we
can also print some planets.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.605
Yippy!

29:34.607 --> 29:36.473
No, Phoebe. You stay here.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.209
A little girl like you doesn't
belong where we're going.

29:39.211 --> 29:42.546
Mitsue, you stay here with
Phoebe while we're gone, okay?

29:42.548 --> 29:44.081
Yeah, right.

29:44.749 --> 29:45.983
Don't look at me.

29:45.985 --> 29:49.186
Do I look like
a babysitter to you?

29:49.188 --> 29:51.822
Besides, you don't even know
what the solar system is.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.824
It's a group of planets
that orbit the sun.

29:53.826 --> 29:55.292
Now, can I go?

29:55.693 --> 29:56.994
Okay.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.096
But you gotta promise
to listen to me.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.298
I promise, I promise, I promise.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.401
If that's all settled,
then let's get out of here!

30:04.403 --> 30:05.803
Activating boosters.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.905
<i>The gadgetgang in outer space!</i>

30:15.647 --> 30:17.381
Is something wrong, hur?

30:17.383 --> 30:21.185
Your face is looking
uglier than usual.

30:21.187 --> 30:24.488
The saucer you mentioned
wasn't completely destroyed.

30:25.123 --> 30:26.557
What?

30:26.559 --> 30:28.525
We detected their signal
close to planet coloccus.

30:31.263 --> 30:34.731
I've already sent two predator
ships to finish the job.

30:34.733 --> 30:36.733
There's nothing to worry about.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.236
The invas are an inferior race.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.805
You're as brainless
as your old friend.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.407
Everything is under control.

30:43.409 --> 30:46.143
We are talking
about invas, gobler.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.445
You never were good at history.

30:48.447 --> 30:51.415
Of course, you wouldn't know
about an ancient legend

30:51.417 --> 30:54.885
that says invas descended
from a great unknown power.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.154
Power? Invas?

30:57.156 --> 31:00.123
Prepare my ship,
I'll take charge.

31:13.838 --> 31:16.240
Put on the translators,
or else you won't understand

31:16.242 --> 31:18.242
what these life
forms are saying.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.518
Incredible.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.788
I can't believe you brought
along extra clothes.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.657
New places, new looks.

31:33.659 --> 31:34.691
Like it?

31:34.693 --> 31:35.926
Hot.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.595
I mean, it might
be hot out there.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.265
Are the translators activated?

31:41.267 --> 31:42.900
Um, maybe not.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.801
Sort of, like, last year's look.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.304
Maybe if the sleeves, uh...

31:47.306 --> 31:49.773
<i>Si fuesen un poquito
más largas lo podria...</i>

31:58.616 --> 32:00.584
You put it on automatic.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.319
A little lower on the hips.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.087
It'll go great with knee-high
patent leather boots.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.356
I don't think
it works with it-girls.

32:06.358 --> 32:08.959
I still don't understand
what she's saying.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.070
It might not be a good idea
for you to come with us.

32:20.072 --> 32:22.039
We never know what
we'll encounter.

32:22.041 --> 32:25.342
That's exactly why you little
guys might need our help.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.011
Let's see if there's
any cool spots around here.

32:31.849 --> 32:34.384
Bye, folks! Take care!

32:34.386 --> 32:37.421
Phoebe! Get back in that saucer
and wait till we return.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.967
You guys sure this is
the way to king mnemus?

32:49.969 --> 32:51.268
How should we know?

32:51.270 --> 32:53.470
We've never been
to coloccus before.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.738
Are you kidding?

32:54.740 --> 32:56.773
You've got us walking
around on a strange planet

32:56.775 --> 32:58.976
not even knowing
where we're going?

32:58.978 --> 33:00.744
An old invas scout rule,

33:00.746 --> 33:02.846
when you don't know
how to find someone,

33:02.848 --> 33:05.282
keep going until they find you.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.617
Doesn't look like anyone
is coming to meet us.

33:10.888 --> 33:12.622
I think I prefer
not being found.

33:23.801 --> 33:25.302
They're gone.

33:25.803 --> 33:27.371
Mmm.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.493
Those things must've been
running away from something.

33:41.953 --> 33:43.120
Holy shoot.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.022
It's <i> El chupacabra!</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:47.190
I don't believe it,
a chupacabra!

33:49.894 --> 33:51.194
In here!

34:03.508 --> 34:05.475
I don't think
chupacabras are very smart...

34:05.477 --> 34:08.277
They may not be smart,
but they're good sniffers.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.684
Oh, I guess I need a shower.

34:34.106 --> 34:35.338
You did it!

34:35.340 --> 34:37.674
Chupacabras don't like perfume.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.543
Come on! It's French.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.112
That was close.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.281
It couldn't end like this.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.116
No, it couldn't.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.851
That was my last bottle!

34:47.853 --> 34:51.054
What the heck did you foreigners
do to my dog, digger?

34:51.056 --> 34:53.723
Now, how am I gonna find
where that treasure is buried

34:53.725 --> 34:55.025
without my bloodhound?

34:55.027 --> 34:56.893
That was a dog?

34:56.895 --> 34:58.728
Boy, I was so close!

34:58.730 --> 35:01.098
But when you airheads
sprayed that stuff on digger,

35:01.100 --> 35:02.499
he lost the scent.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.768
We're on a special mission
to find the king.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.336
Do you know where
we can find him?

35:06.338 --> 35:08.205
Are you kin to the king?

35:08.207 --> 35:10.340
No! Do you know where he is?

35:10.342 --> 35:13.210
I hope he don't come 'round
this neck of the woods.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.949
We warned you once.

35:18.951 --> 35:20.917
No trespassing here.

35:20.919 --> 35:24.921
Uh, we was just
passing through, partner.

35:24.923 --> 35:27.124
I will take you to the king.

35:27.725 --> 35:28.792
Yes!

35:37.135 --> 35:38.702
You want some?

35:42.473 --> 35:43.540
Ugh!

35:44.909 --> 35:46.576
Your move.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.046
Hey, tank.
Stop hogging the soda.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.553
Go on, your turn.
Take his piece.

35:56.555 --> 35:57.654
Eat them up.

35:59.457 --> 36:00.991
I didn't mean that.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.058
Yuck!

36:02.060 --> 36:04.027
You guys eat plastic?

36:04.029 --> 36:05.295
Gross!

36:12.069 --> 36:13.403
Goddarn it!

36:13.405 --> 36:16.106
Always some earthling
messing up my day.

36:16.108 --> 36:18.074
Hey, I know you.

36:18.076 --> 36:19.342
I think you're...

36:19.344 --> 36:22.979
Dudes! He's that alien
from roswell!

36:22.981 --> 36:24.481
Awesome!

36:24.483 --> 36:27.250
I knew I'd seen this guy before.

36:27.252 --> 36:30.453
Dudes, I'm telling you,
the truth's out there.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.656
Wow, get a load of that view!

36:32.658 --> 36:34.758
I knew this was gonna happen.

36:46.103 --> 36:52.309
Sir, I found these intergalactic
intruders in the prohibited territory.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.244
Visitors to coloccus?

36:54.246 --> 36:56.479
How did you find our planet?

36:56.481 --> 36:59.516
Found it here, in my <i> hitchhiker's
guide to the galaxy.</i>

36:59.518 --> 37:01.451
Hey, we're not with this,

37:01.453 --> 37:03.653
this Indiana Jones from space!

37:03.655 --> 37:05.589
We're here for something else.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.357
We're looking for king mnemus.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.392
What did he say?

37:09.394 --> 37:11.228
It was him! He said it.

37:11.230 --> 37:15.065
I think mnemus is, like,
a bad word in their language.

37:15.067 --> 37:18.368
I hope is one of those
not-so-bad, bad words.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.869
Silence!

37:19.871 --> 37:20.971
Who are you?

37:20.973 --> 37:22.706
We're inva captains.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.875
Our ambassadress ordered us to
find the great king mnemus.

37:25.877 --> 37:29.613
But why would the inva
ambassadress send you to coloccus?

37:30.548 --> 37:32.816
That's a long story.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.784
The confederation
was being attacked,

37:34.786 --> 37:37.554
and all the interplanetary
leaders were there.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.155
Prisoners in
the planet's capital.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.573
Huh?

38:04.949 --> 38:06.016
Inva?

38:06.651 --> 38:07.717
Yes.

38:07.719 --> 38:10.220
I, too, am a descendant
of the inva.

38:10.222 --> 38:13.523
But, how is it you
came to live here?

38:13.525 --> 38:16.192
The invas were
a powerful people.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.927
A great inva scientist

38:17.929 --> 38:20.063
developed a weapon
that provided invas

38:20.065 --> 38:21.965
with an unimaginable power.

38:21.967 --> 38:25.201
By any chance,
did it happen to be a ring?

38:25.203 --> 38:27.504
Our leaders became greedy.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.472
Power changes people.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.941
Even for a gentle
people like us.

38:31.943 --> 38:33.943
What a voice!

38:33.945 --> 38:36.846
The struggle to control
that all-powerful weapon

38:36.848 --> 38:39.849
cost many lives
and much suffering.

38:39.851 --> 38:42.886
The scientist left
invaxia with his family,

38:42.888 --> 38:45.755
taking along with him
the weapon he created.

38:45.757 --> 38:48.625
That long forgotten
scientist was my ancestor,

38:49.260 --> 38:51.695
invocalus mnemus.

38:51.697 --> 38:55.465
He brought his family to
this dry and hostile planet

38:55.467 --> 38:58.668
in an effort
to restart his life.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.671
The federation has long
forgotten the planet coloccus.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.643
There is no technology here.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.611
That's why, my young ones,

39:08.613 --> 39:10.947
you won't find any help here.

39:12.583 --> 39:14.217
You can't ignore this!

39:14.219 --> 39:17.020
The universe is depending on us!

39:17.022 --> 39:18.922
That's not our problem.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.991
I shall not involve
coloccus in a new war.

39:21.993 --> 39:26.129
We came to this planet to remain
far and forever from that.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.632
He's just a little selfish, huh?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.034
Enough!

39:31.036 --> 39:33.470
We're going to take you
back to your ship.

39:51.021 --> 39:54.124
It's a ufo
abducting another ufo!

39:54.126 --> 39:55.392
Awesome!

39:55.926 --> 39:57.160
No!

39:57.162 --> 39:58.395
Phoebe!

39:58.397 --> 40:00.096
We need to go after them!

40:00.098 --> 40:01.664
You must help us!

40:09.039 --> 40:10.840
I hope I won't regret this.

40:31.562 --> 40:33.096
Where are the other invas?

40:36.333 --> 40:37.700
Phoebe, chill out!

40:37.702 --> 40:40.170
These robot dudes
aren't Mr. nice guys.

40:42.072 --> 40:45.208
Ah! My balloons are ready.

40:45.210 --> 40:48.945
But they're not yet elevated
enough to speak with me.

41:15.573 --> 41:19.642
These objects have remained
unseen by many generation.

41:21.011 --> 41:23.780
This map shows where
the pieces are hidden,

41:23.782 --> 41:26.583
and this is the key
that opens the temple.

41:26.585 --> 41:29.285
You picked a fine time
to play treasure hunt.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.154
Did you say, "treasure"?

41:31.156 --> 41:32.789
According to the legend,

41:32.791 --> 41:35.825
this map leads to the
location of the lethal weapon

41:35.827 --> 41:38.862
that could destroy
all other armies.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.231
It's just a bunch of guns?

41:41.233 --> 41:42.532
What do you mean, "just"?

41:42.534 --> 41:44.734
That's exactly what
we need right now!

41:44.736 --> 41:47.737
The contents of the temple
have never been revealed.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.372
According to the map,

41:49.374 --> 41:52.775
the temple is at the south
pole of the planet incos.

41:52.777 --> 41:55.578
This could only be a legend,

41:55.580 --> 41:57.914
but I think you have
no other choice.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.918
There's just one little problem.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.754
We don't have
a spaceship, remember?

42:04.756 --> 42:06.856
Spaceship? I got me one

42:06.858 --> 42:09.959
but to run you varmints around,
it's gonna cost you...

42:09.961 --> 42:12.829
15% of that treasure
in my hands. Deal?

42:12.831 --> 42:15.298
What a nice guy.

42:22.172 --> 42:23.573
Hey, digger!

42:29.346 --> 42:30.713
Is this your ship?

42:30.715 --> 42:32.515
You're more brave
than I thought.

42:32.517 --> 42:34.284
Whoo-hoo! All aboard!

42:52.436 --> 42:53.770
Phew.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.005
I couldn't keep doing
that voice much longer.

43:01.145 --> 43:03.479
Somebody gonna point me
in the right direction?

43:03.481 --> 43:05.415
Let me see.

43:05.417 --> 43:08.318
<i>In 300 miles, turn left, then
proceed for 4,000 miles.</i>

43:08.320 --> 43:11.921
<i>At the roundabout on the second
moon, take the third exit.</i>

43:15.326 --> 43:16.593
Huh?

43:20.398 --> 43:22.065
Phew.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.300
What kind of space junk is that?

43:27.104 --> 43:28.905
I like this one.

43:28.907 --> 43:31.674
Listen, you are going
to have a big problem

43:31.676 --> 43:33.142
if you don't start talking about

43:33.144 --> 43:35.912
what you were doing
on that deserted planet.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.882
<i>Your highness,</i>

43:39.884 --> 43:41.784
<i>a transport has been
sighted leaving the planet</i>

43:41.786 --> 43:43.553
<i>where we found the prisoners.</i>

43:43.555 --> 43:45.054
Hmm.

43:45.056 --> 43:47.690
I knew my brother
would find a way to rescue us.

43:47.692 --> 43:50.326
Rescue you?

43:50.328 --> 43:52.328
And who is going to save them?

43:53.263 --> 43:54.464
Change course.

43:54.466 --> 43:57.133
Let's find out
who's really behind all this.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.108
It's gotta be that one
over there!

44:05.110 --> 44:07.210
Buckle up, everybody!
We're going in!

44:07.212 --> 44:09.212
Everyone sit up,
put on your safety belts.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.049
Whoa... huh?

44:24.962 --> 44:28.231
Steady! I want them alive.

44:31.902 --> 44:33.903
A little closer...

44:34.972 --> 44:37.006
Now!

44:37.008 --> 44:38.808
What? Where did that come from?

44:38.810 --> 44:40.576
We lost an engine!

44:40.578 --> 44:41.844
Hold on!

44:41.846 --> 44:43.413
You know how to fly this thing?

45:00.464 --> 45:01.731
That's the way to go!

45:01.733 --> 45:03.299
Where'd you learn to fly?

45:03.301 --> 45:04.600
Playstando!

45:04.602 --> 45:07.336
My mom always said that
video games were useless.

45:09.606 --> 45:11.908
Whoo! I almost got it!

45:11.910 --> 45:13.643
I don't know what's worst...

45:13.645 --> 45:16.012
Being hit, or watching this.

45:18.348 --> 45:22.018
Okay, okay! Watching Gregory
was better than this!

45:22.020 --> 45:24.854
That guy's got one of them
back-end Cannon things!

45:27.524 --> 45:28.791
Can you guys land this ship?

45:28.793 --> 45:30.560
With one engine
it's gonna be hard!

45:30.562 --> 45:32.795
You can do it, Greg!

45:38.469 --> 45:40.436
Keep them on the radar.

45:42.606 --> 45:44.774
I think they forgot about us.

45:44.776 --> 45:46.042
We gotta get out of here,

45:46.044 --> 45:48.778
I need to scratch my nose!

45:48.780 --> 45:50.880
Let me give you a hand. Ouch!

45:56.054 --> 45:58.521
Tank! That's not helping.

46:01.859 --> 46:03.993
Nice job, tank!

46:03.995 --> 46:07.029
Right on, tank!
How'd you do that?

46:07.031 --> 46:09.766
Oh, gross, tank!

46:16.840 --> 46:18.407
<i>Collision imminent.</i>

46:18.409 --> 46:20.476
Hold on for dear life!

46:35.759 --> 46:38.461
I think we stopped.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.798
Whoo! Kid, that was a
textbook landing.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.301
Yes!

46:45.303 --> 46:47.870
Our center of gravity
has been disrupted.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.041
Guys, don't move!

47:01.952 --> 47:03.386
Bring them in.

47:03.388 --> 47:06.389
Sir, their spacecraft
is unstable.

47:06.391 --> 47:09.926
If we use the tractor ray
we can bring them down.

47:09.928 --> 47:11.894
All soldiers to the attack!

47:16.734 --> 47:18.768
Stop moving around, banana.

47:18.770 --> 47:21.504
Wasn't me,
I'm not even breathing.

47:21.506 --> 47:23.206
That felt more like a...

47:29.613 --> 47:31.614
Oh... but...

47:34.985 --> 47:37.086
Where's that caterpillar now?

47:38.522 --> 47:39.989
You gotta be kidding.

47:39.991 --> 47:42.291
We don't understand
anything about this.

47:42.293 --> 47:44.393
Hey, a computer is a computer.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.929
And anyone who can get
around my dad's computer

47:46.931 --> 47:49.432
can get around any computer.

47:50.969 --> 47:53.035
Look! That's ours!

47:53.037 --> 47:55.404
Looks like it's stuck
in a force field.

47:55.406 --> 47:59.275
Can you disable it?
Hmm... give me a sec.

48:01.945 --> 48:04.013
Give up! You are surrounded.

48:04.015 --> 48:05.314
They're coming, dude!

48:05.316 --> 48:07.516
I think we better
listen to them.

48:07.518 --> 48:09.051
Oh, no!

48:09.053 --> 48:11.454
We can't let the inva treasure
fall into the wrong hands.

48:14.157 --> 48:16.792
Just leave them tin cans to me!

48:24.735 --> 48:26.335
How do we close it down?

48:36.346 --> 48:38.981
Guys! This is it. Jump this way.

49:01.738 --> 49:03.272
Strike!

49:05.375 --> 49:06.442
Huh?

49:11.848 --> 49:13.582
Are you all right?

49:14.484 --> 49:17.253
I'm amazing! Don't you agree?

49:24.194 --> 49:26.495
I suppose we've lost them.

49:27.998 --> 49:29.532
Zombie robots!

49:32.135 --> 49:34.670
We better step on it!
They're on our tail.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.648
Dang. These rust buckets
are sure tough!

50:13.377 --> 50:14.677
Come on!

50:14.679 --> 50:15.911
Good, Gregory!

50:15.913 --> 50:18.047
Dude, I'm banana.

50:18.049 --> 50:20.783
Oops, sorry.
You all look alike to me.

50:21.718 --> 50:23.285
Cease fire.

50:46.443 --> 50:48.611
Why did you hit me with
that stupid stone?

50:53.083 --> 50:55.084
Oh, my bad!

50:55.086 --> 50:56.719
Look, I can see them!

51:05.695 --> 51:06.829
What?

51:06.831 --> 51:08.564
Wrong direction.

51:30.887 --> 51:34.190
Phoebe! I told you this was
too dangerous for you!

51:34.192 --> 51:36.659
Really? Who just rescued you?

51:37.060 --> 51:38.360
Ha, ha.

51:38.362 --> 51:40.262
Got ourselves another
new friend, eh?

51:40.264 --> 51:43.265
Looks like I'm pretty good
at attracting weirdos.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.734
Reckon there ain't
nobody weird here.

51:46.904 --> 51:48.170
You talk funny!

51:48.905 --> 51:50.106
Where's the map?

51:50.108 --> 51:52.475
Got it here in my backpack.

51:55.545 --> 51:58.280
We need to reach
this tower, here.

52:02.352 --> 52:06.288
Your highness, we've got them
in our sights. Should we fire?

52:06.290 --> 52:08.424
You still don't get it, do you?

52:08.426 --> 52:10.826
Their escape was
part of the plan.

52:11.495 --> 52:12.728
Was it?

52:18.902 --> 52:22.171
Wow! Oh!

52:34.184 --> 52:35.718
Over here, you guys!

53:17.961 --> 53:19.461
We've got to turn that key.

53:19.463 --> 53:20.796
According to the map,

53:20.798 --> 53:23.199
we can't rub up against
the sides of this cave.

53:23.201 --> 53:24.633
Otherwise...

53:24.635 --> 53:26.268
Otherwise, what?

53:26.270 --> 53:27.970
It doesn't say.

53:27.972 --> 53:30.072
Leave it to me!
My arm is skinny.

53:30.074 --> 53:31.273
No way!

53:31.275 --> 53:33.642
Boring! You never let me help.

53:33.644 --> 53:36.445
My arm is not that thick,
I think I can do it.

53:36.447 --> 53:38.280
Think?

53:43.853 --> 53:45.387
High four!

53:47.657 --> 53:48.724
Huh?

53:56.700 --> 53:57.933
What?

54:32.435 --> 54:34.203
I guess the key goes here.

54:34.205 --> 54:35.871
I will get it.

54:40.877 --> 54:42.211
Hmm...

54:42.213 --> 54:43.846
Maybe it needs a battery.

54:43.848 --> 54:47.850
Strange... it's missing
a piece, isn't it?

54:47.852 --> 54:50.853
Is this what you're looking for?

54:54.658 --> 54:56.692
I'm just as anxious as you

54:56.694 --> 54:59.862
to discover this mysterious
inva technology.

55:14.944 --> 55:16.412
Whoa...

55:29.592 --> 55:32.394
Put down your weapons,
or this is gone!

55:37.734 --> 55:39.034
Yes!

55:39.836 --> 55:41.370
Now step back!

55:49.979 --> 55:51.380
Enough, kid.

55:51.382 --> 55:53.849
Your show is over.

55:58.054 --> 55:59.922
Let my brother go!

56:02.325 --> 56:04.460
That's my friend! Let him go!

56:06.463 --> 56:08.764
Look here, you worm in a bottle!

56:08.766 --> 56:12.468
Free the kid or I'll...
Or you'll what? You idiot!

56:14.004 --> 56:15.070
You wouldn't.

56:20.411 --> 56:22.478
Are you hurt, Greg?

56:36.559 --> 56:38.560
Put it down, kid.

56:41.364 --> 56:45.067
Now, if you stay quiet,
I'll let you live.

56:49.572 --> 56:51.573
<i>If this passage
has been violated</i>

56:51.575 --> 56:53.675
<i>bringing you to this
forgotten vault,</i>

56:53.677 --> 56:55.310
<i>then it means
that my successors know</i>

56:55.312 --> 56:57.579
<i>that the time has come.</i>

56:57.581 --> 57:00.215
<i>My research may be used
to defend the ideals</i>

57:00.217 --> 57:02.284
<i>that I've always believed in,</i>

57:02.286 --> 57:05.888
<i>but you must use what's
herein with wisdom.</i>

57:30.413 --> 57:32.714
Why did I waste my time

57:32.716 --> 57:35.117
chasing after something
that belongs

57:35.119 --> 57:37.553
to these useless goofs?

57:37.555 --> 57:40.622
It can't be...
Everything is broken.

57:41.491 --> 57:43.058
Space junk.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.259
That's your treasure.

57:44.261 --> 57:46.028
That's not fair.

57:47.430 --> 57:50.365
This is the essence
of the inva people.

57:50.367 --> 57:52.601
A revolting green slime

57:52.603 --> 57:54.736
that destroys
everything it touches.

57:57.774 --> 58:00.175
Start teletransport,
immediately.

58:00.177 --> 58:02.711
We've already wasted
too much time here.

58:02.713 --> 58:04.580
Yes, your highness.

58:04.582 --> 58:06.915
You belong to this trash heap.

58:06.917 --> 58:09.518
Rot here with the
rest of this junk.

58:18.828 --> 58:20.929
Set a course for althurbar.

58:20.931 --> 58:23.866
I've been away from the
capital for too long.

58:26.469 --> 58:29.972
We should never have
involved you in this mess.

58:40.717 --> 58:42.217
No signal from roswell.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.687
I guess he didn't...

58:48.358 --> 58:50.225
It's all our fault.

58:52.796 --> 58:55.631
There's no way... it's over.

58:57.800 --> 59:01.270
Why did we fall for
that stupid old legend?

59:01.272 --> 59:03.472
That worm in a bowl was right.

59:03.474 --> 59:06.542
We're just a bunch
of useless goofs.

59:09.579 --> 59:10.779
That's it!

59:10.781 --> 59:12.714
Gana gobler was right!

59:12.716 --> 59:14.082
Come on, this is no time

59:14.084 --> 59:16.084
for you to be picking
on the little guys.

59:16.086 --> 59:18.987
Really, Greg? You don't get it?

59:18.989 --> 59:21.957
The green slime is the
essence of the invas.

59:21.959 --> 59:23.058
Huh?

59:23.060 --> 59:24.593
These ships aren't
the inva's treasure,

59:24.595 --> 59:26.562
don't you remember
what the king said?

59:26.564 --> 59:28.263
"In the cave you'll
find something"

59:28.265 --> 59:31.300
"that will destroy the
best equipped armies!"

59:31.302 --> 59:33.468
Exactly! Look over here.

59:33.470 --> 59:37.739
This green slime has the power
to destroy any technology.

59:38.875 --> 59:41.677
This is the inva treasure.

59:41.679 --> 59:43.412
What a nice treasure.

59:43.414 --> 59:45.180
These old spaceships are here

59:45.182 --> 59:47.249
just to show how
this stuff works!

59:48.918 --> 59:50.352
Wow!

59:50.354 --> 59:53.255
Awesome! This goop is a
weapon of mass destruction!

59:53.257 --> 59:55.791
But, how we gonna
get out of here?

59:58.361 --> 59:59.494
Ha!

59:59.496 --> 01:00:00.862
You mean this junk?

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:03.498
Oh, no! This isn't junk.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.201
It's the raw material we need.

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:07.970
I'm in, gregorio.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.710
That could work.

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:18.547
That caterpillar will
get what it deserves!

01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:20.515
Oh, you really are silly.

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:21.683
Huh? Hmm!

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:26.521
I'm serious! I sent them
a very detailed message.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:27.923
They must be on their way.

01:00:29.258 --> 01:00:30.325
I'm sorry my dear,

01:00:30.327 --> 01:00:33.929
but I have to tell you,
we're all gonna die!

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.665
Gobler is up to
something bigger.

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:38.500
If we are still alive

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:41.436
that's because he needs us.

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:45.273
Sooner or later that hiding
nose-dirt will come out.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.043
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm.

01:00:50.279 --> 01:00:52.180
Who threw this in my chair?

01:00:52.182 --> 01:00:53.448
Gobler!

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:56.385
Your highness, I... i
didn't know you were back.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:09.665
Call the leaders and
convince them to join us.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.068
Oh, gana, shouldn't we wait for

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.070
things to calm
down a little bit?

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:17.673
You know, the relationship
between me and them

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:19.274
is not at its best...

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.309
Oh, you lazy pachyderm!

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:23.078
Leave it to me.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.013
Take them to the boulevard.

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:28.850
I'm going to make them a little
offer they won't be able to refuse.

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:34.723
Ahh! Why do I have to do
everything around here?

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.865
How nice it is that you
all came to see me.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:46.168
We need to talk.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:48.837
Let me be straight
with you people.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:51.773
This confederation thing
just wasn't working.

01:01:51.775 --> 01:01:54.643
All this, "respect
primitive species..."

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:57.713
And "don't interfere with
planets in development."

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:59.748
Blah, blah, blah...

01:02:00.483 --> 01:02:01.983
Wake up!

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:04.853
There are a few advanced
cultures in the galaxies.

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:10.425
Who could forget how
superior we are?

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:13.161
Lower species should
take a lesson from us!

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:16.732
You are going to get
what you deserve, gana!

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:20.502
I'm afraid I have a little
bad news for you, miss inva.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:24.506
Your teacher had to leave
and she won't be coming back.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:25.874
What's the problem with using

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:28.343
forgotten planets
as garbage dumps?

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:32.180
Recycling is a waste of time,
look at me.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.016
Nature needs to be modified.

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.521
Isn't that irresistible?

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.890
Oh!

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:50.465
No one will take part in
your perverse alliance!

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:54.836
Very well.

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:57.239
Have it your way.
I knew you wouldn't.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.541
You can't say I didn't
give you a chance.

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.012
Take them away! Execute them!

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:05.981
Execute the prisoners?

01:03:05.983 --> 01:03:08.283
But that was never agreed to!

01:03:09.987 --> 01:03:13.855
Killing all the leaders in the
galaxy was never part of our plan!

01:03:13.857 --> 01:03:15.056
I would not have agreed with you

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:16.558
had I known this before!

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.827
Oh, so you don't agree?

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:32.007
Who's first?
Guess I'll choose...

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:36.411
Me? No! No, no, why me?

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.218
Oh!

01:03:46.055 --> 01:03:48.290
You can't do this!

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:52.594
Calm down, you'll have
to wait your turn.

01:03:52.596 --> 01:03:55.096
<i>Captain, we've sighted
a squadron of ships</i>

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:56.865
<i>approaching the main boulevard.</i>

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.300
We're coming!

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:22.057
It's just a video game, tank.
Just a game...

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:36.071
Feel the power of the slime.

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:39.040
Now!

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:43.245
Ugh!

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:49.784
Excellent!

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:52.187
Distract the soldiers while
we try to free the prisoners.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.627
Perfect! Looks like we
have their attention.

01:04:58.629 --> 01:04:59.928
Follow me, guys!

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.399
Your highness?

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:09.938
What? What is it?
Tell me they're all dead.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.574
No. Your highness, uh...

01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:13.775
We had a little set back.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:16.411
We... we are being attacked.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:18.613
Attacked? By whom?

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:20.215
An unknown fleet, sir.

01:05:20.217 --> 01:05:23.418
Our first response
squadron was destroyed.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.187
Those invas!

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:30.325
Send all enforcements.
Destroy them all!

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:33.395
They've already gotten to the
other side of the capital.

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:39.234
Go after them!

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.486
Good job!

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:19.407
Uh? Huh?

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.609
Phoebe, that's
not a place for little kids.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:23.611
Get back into the ship
and stay there!

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.848
Don't touch anything and don't
open the door for anyone.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.350
Ah!

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:31.486
This passageway goes straight
to the central dungeon.

01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:35.123
Oh!

01:06:38.528 --> 01:06:40.428
I'm all right, I'm all right!

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:45.433
Uh?

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:47.102
Ah!

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:50.405
Hmm... look who I found here.

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:55.110
Did I ever tell you how great
you look in that aquarium?

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.278
Still trying
to save the universe

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.148
with those stupid,
irritating jokes?

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.450
It's not going to happen.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:05.453
Commander, close the air
ducts to the dungeon.

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:10.158
What the? They closed the doors?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.860
Where's gregorio?

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:14.796
I don't know how, but I think he
must have gotten lost on the way.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.435
Ew! This is gross!

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.541
I'm in trouble!

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:27.942
Can't shake them!

01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:29.444
I'll cover for you!

01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:31.713
There's too many of them!
We're not gonna make it!

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:42.624
Just in time
with the green slime.

01:07:42.626 --> 01:07:45.794
I love these spaceship games!

01:07:45.796 --> 01:07:48.296
But this game doesn't
have, "continue."

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:55.470
Hmm?

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:05.213
Oh, now it's hide-and-seek.

01:08:07.184 --> 01:08:12.320
I already told you, I don't play
games, you insignificant brat.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.456
Uh?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:31.072
I think our job is done.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.740
Yeah! We showed them!

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:42.783
Easier than I thought.
Just enough fuel to fly.

01:08:42.786 --> 01:08:45.687
Looks like the party
is still raging.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.725
Get ready to go
into ground-war mode!

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:55.697
Yeah! Final stage.
Here come the bosses.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:58.700
Now we'll find
out if this junk really works.

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.551
I'm out of ammunition!

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:19.921
Any of you dudes got
some slime left?

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.723
I still got some... uh...

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.725
Not anymore.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.495
Take that, tin man!

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.599
Ouch, that hurt!

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:35.837
Hey! That's not nice!

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.251
This is a little harder
than we thought!

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:15.143
Captain! Send enforcements
to the front of the prison.

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:17.579
Yes sir, your highness!

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.583
Enforcements moving.

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.686
Yeah!

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.688
What is the status
of the prisoners?

01:10:27.991 --> 01:10:29.791
Captain! Can you hear me?

01:10:29.793 --> 01:10:30.858
Call dropped again.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.228
You need to change your carrier.

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.697
Hey! That tickles!

01:10:35.699 --> 01:10:38.933
Now you are going to pay
for every stupid joke!

01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:42.003
This is gonna
take a while, then.

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:49.077
Ta-da! We are here to save you.

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:51.546
Invas? This must be a joke.

01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:55.283
Let's move it, we got a plan.
Come on, let's get going!

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:59.120
Aw, the invas have a plan.
Isn't that nice?

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:02.023
Ha! Now that's gotta be good.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:03.691
What don't you understand?

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:05.326
We came here to rescue you!

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:09.264
You? What chance do
you have against gana?

01:11:09.266 --> 01:11:11.799
You are invas! You are useless.

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:14.736
Are you serious?

01:11:14.738 --> 01:11:16.804
They came here
risking everything!

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:19.874
Against monsters, robots,
enemy spaceships,

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:22.977
and even gana gobler,
just to save you!

01:11:22.979 --> 01:11:26.347
You bunch of narrow-minded
alien bosses.

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:29.083
You know? You guys
deserve to stay here.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:36.591
Wait! The earthling
with the big nose is right!

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:39.794
Our arrogance has made us blind.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:42.297
It's true, it's true.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.098
You're gonna trust them?

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.802
Quiet! If there's anyone here
who can't be trusted, it's you!

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:51.072
Well done.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.541
Now, how do we get out of here?

01:11:53.543 --> 01:11:56.577
Good question, we haven't
thought of that yet.

01:12:07.957 --> 01:12:11.225
Come out, come
out, annoying boy.

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:13.594
This is so boring.

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:18.199
Look... my favorite
little monster.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.041
You know what's the most
disgusting thing about you?

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:29.844
You swim in the same place
as you do your,

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.346
well... you know.

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:35.383
Hmm.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.798
Hey!

01:13:07.317 --> 01:13:08.916
We can't win, retreat!

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:16.958
Ah, this is getting pretty ugly.

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:23.898
Loser!

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:40.815
What'd you guys do
to these robots?

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:45.953
Now you're gonna die.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.992
Give up, gobler!
You're surrounded.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:52.693
I always wanted to say that.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:55.530
Game over, monster in a bottle.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:58.766
I don't think so.

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:05.606
Back off, and I promise
to hurt you just a wee little.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:22.690
Game over!

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:42.643
Yes!

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:53.554
Free the earthling, gobler!

01:14:53.556 --> 01:14:56.491
Don't come any closer,
or I'll finish the kid.

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.796
Stay where you are, gobler!

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:05.666
Let my brother go,
you road-kill vermin.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.669
Perfect! Now I
have two hostages.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:11.606
I said, take your
hands off my brother!

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.541
Phoebe! Get out of there!

01:15:13.543 --> 01:15:16.677
Oh, let the little girl
come for the ride.

01:15:16.679 --> 01:15:18.813
It'll be so much fun.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:21.883
What's your problem?
Are you deaf or something?

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.553
<i>You shall not pass!</i>

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.388
Uh?

01:15:29.292 --> 01:15:32.293
And I thought the invas were the
dumbest creatures in the universe.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:36.597
You don't have a chance, brat.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.306
Ugh! Turn that off!

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:20.942
It's gonna be easy
to lock this one up.

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:34.922
It's over! I can't
believe it's over.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.857
And?

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.961
And thanks, sis.

01:16:39.963 --> 01:16:41.062
You saved me.

01:16:41.064 --> 01:16:43.030
You saved the whole universe.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.205
You are my darling heroes!

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.208
I knew I could count on you.

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:56.944
Commendable work. I was wrong.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:17:01.148
In the first place, you were wrong
to align yourself with this...

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.384
This... evil worm!

01:17:03.386 --> 01:17:06.954
You are charged with treason
to the confederation.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:13.561
But it couldn't be
helped, I was tricked.

01:17:13.563 --> 01:17:16.564
You will pay
for your unfaithfulness.

01:17:16.566 --> 01:17:20.001
You'll be in prison right
next to your friend here.

01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:30.645
The confederation is eternally
indebted to the invas!

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.079
It was our duty, sir.

01:17:32.081 --> 01:17:33.614
But we couldn't have
done it without the help

01:17:33.616 --> 01:17:35.016
of our friends from earth.

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:39.787
There's a great deal of
work to be done here, now.

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:43.357
There are many things
that need to be rebuilt.

01:17:43.359 --> 01:17:47.762
And now, I dedicate the new
confederation monument.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.100
That's me, look!

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:55.803
Come on, that's obviously me.

01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:58.305
You guys are blind.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:00.107
Clearly, that's my nose.

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.210
As a new confederation governor,

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:07.581
I congratulate the heroes,
responsible for our freedom!

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:22.296
Howdy, folks! Talk about
a bottomless hole.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:28.269
You know, you still
owe me for that ride.

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.447
And now, it's your turn!

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.449
Really?

01:18:41.451 --> 01:18:43.017
I got a better idea.

01:18:55.263 --> 01:18:56.430
Uh, mine!

01:18:59.634 --> 01:19:02.203
The gadgetgang in outer space!

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:19.153
I've never seen
anything like this!

01:19:19.155 --> 01:19:23.324
I don't ever recall there been
a kinetic model, fantastic.

01:19:23.326 --> 01:19:25.826
I think we are
looking at the winner.

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:31.499
Oh, oh, yes,

01:19:31.501 --> 01:19:33.701
these kids certainly
deserve the gold!

01:19:33.703 --> 01:19:37.638
How did you get the planets to go
around in their orbits like this?

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:38.806
Uh...

01:19:38.808 --> 01:19:40.508
Oh, that's simple.

01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:42.076
First, we magnetize the planets,

01:19:42.078 --> 01:19:45.012
then we polarize them
with electron crystals.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:47.281
Of course,
with a few distortions...

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.483
But not visible
to the human eye.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.853
Which class are you from?

01:19:52.855 --> 01:19:54.822
They're the new
exchange students.

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.359
<i>¶ Check this out, dudes</i>

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:01.428
<i>¶ let me tell you a little story</i>

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.597
<i>¶ a spaceship took a thrashing</i>

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:04.932
<i>¶ in an alien Fender bender</i>

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.500
<i>¶ the paint-job got a scratching</i>

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:08.235
<i>¶ "no problem"
said the commander</i>

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:09.970
<i>¶ limping to a custom shop</i>

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:11.539
<i>¶ we took it near the milky way</i>

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.207
<i>¶ ain't got no budget
to repair it</i>

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:14.875
<i>¶ instead of paint
graffiti spray</i>

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:16.844
<i>¶ double power, supercharging</i>

01:20:16.846 --> 01:20:18.412
<i>¶ need to jump us to light speed</i>

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:22.149
<i>¶ mold and fit even larger
creature comforts that we need</i>

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:27.988
<i>¶ yeah, my brothers</i>

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.357
<i>¶ lay back</i>

01:20:35.463 --> 01:20:38.699
<i>¶ horns replaced by subwoofers
headlights by laser beams</i>

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:40.367
<i>¶ like a hot rod flying saucer</i>

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.136
<i>¶ way beyond our wildest dreams</i>

01:20:42.138 --> 01:20:45.573
<i>¶ gas station they're pumping
found another kind of fuel</i>

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:47.141
<i>¶ when this baby hits a bump</i>

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:49.109
<i>¶ there's no shaking
and it's cool</i>

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:50.678
<i>¶ pedal to the metal</i>

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.213
<i>¶ no more time to be marooning</i>

01:20:52.215 --> 01:20:53.914
<i>¶ got to get to where
we're going</i>

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:56.851
<i>¶ with the v8 motor tuned</i>

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.286
<i>¶ not bad</i>

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.423
<i>¶ easy now</i>

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:08.896
<i>¶ all aboard, my brothers</i>

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:16.570
<i>¶ this is the intergalactic ride</i>

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.306
<i>¶ easy</i>

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.010
<i>¶ come on</i>

01:21:24.305 --> 01:21:30.226
