09:46.237 --> 09:47.717
Yes, but it's quite a leap
to thinking

09:47.761 --> 09:49.893
Forest killed someone then
or now, Charlotte.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.592
After years of working
at that firm, I know

09:52.635 --> 09:54.768

09:54.811 --> 09:56.639
Deep down,

09:56.683 --> 09:59.729
I know what I helped cover up
was murder.

09:59.773 --> 10:00.904
I believe her.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.602
Really?

10:02.645 --> 10:04.604
Mm.Why?

10:04.647 --> 10:06.649
Well, which quintessential
response would you like?

10:06.693 --> 10:07.737

enigmatic one

10:07.781 --> 10:09.913

10:09.957 --> 10:11.567
How about the truth.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.049
Well, when Charlotte had her
mini-death, she went to Hell.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.181
Forest haunted her Hell loop

10:17.225 --> 10:18.661
and now is haunting
her nightmares--

is flat-out insane.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.113
Eh.CHARLOTTE: Anyway,

10:36.157 --> 10:38.376
if Forest killed someone
13 years ago,

10:38.420 --> 10:41.249
the odds that he killed again
are not unrealistic.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.687
Please, just look into it.

everyone involved.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.607

10:51.651 --> 10:53.217
I will start with Forest.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.886

11:09.930 --> 11:11.453
But you don't day drink.

said made me think.

11:15.370 --> 11:19.156
Maybe celestial
beings and humans...

Luci, maybe they
aren't that different.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.508

I'm talking about the rules
of Heaven and Hell, Luci.

11:28.557 --> 11:31.299
It's all based on
humans' subconscious,

11:31.342 --> 11:32.779
what they think they deserve.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.520
What if that applies
to us as well?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.522
Right. That's enough

No, listen.

And then I thought
that you were somehow my test,

11:46.706 --> 11:49.665
that in helping God's most
wayward soul, that I would

11:49.709 --> 11:51.754
somehow find redemption.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.278
But, Luci,
I've just been guessing.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.150
Dad never told me any
of those things.

11:56.193 --> 11:58.239
Since when does Dad
ever tell us anything?

11:58.282 --> 12:00.241
That's exactly my point,
brother.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.070
What if He wants us
to judge ourselves?

12:03.113 --> 12:04.332
So my wings,
your wings,

12:04.375 --> 12:06.769

12:06.813 --> 12:09.293
Brother, what if

12:09.337 --> 12:12.166

who control all of it?

12:12.209 --> 12:13.558
Brother,

12:13.602 --> 12:17.519

absolutely absurd.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.913
