WEBVTT

00:47.439 --> 00:48.741
Detroit Police?

00:49.876 --> 00:52.745
There has been a
theft in the museum.

00:57.315 --> 00:59.618
Chief, we've got Marcellus.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.113
Yo, let's go!

02:36.749 --> 02:39.886
Why are you such
a stick in the mud?

02:41.419 --> 02:43.756
It's not just my
scene, that's all.

02:43.823 --> 02:46.726
Why do you even want
to hang out with me?

02:46.793 --> 02:49.427
You enjoy your Detroit
friends so much better.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.633
They don't matter like you do.

02:53.699 --> 02:55.600
- Even your mother was...
- My mother?

02:56.601 --> 02:57.937
You gotta be kidding me.

02:58.004 --> 02:59.739
What the hell, man?

02:59.806 --> 03:01.606
Would you please stop?

03:01.674 --> 03:03.608
I can take care of myself.

03:03.676 --> 03:04.710
What is that?

03:04.777 --> 03:06.378
Stick in the mud.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.616
What was that?

03:12.718 --> 03:14.921
Did you hear that?

03:14.987 --> 03:16.856
Hey, come on out,
you piece of shit.

03:17.657 --> 03:18.925
Rachelle, run!

03:47.954 --> 03:48.821
Mornin', Billie.

03:48.888 --> 03:50.555
Hell of a way to
start a mornin'.

03:50.622 --> 03:51.891
Check in with
Lieutenant Rossman.

03:51.958 --> 03:54.526
He'll get your assignment
at the crime scene, okay?

04:00.900 --> 04:01.868
What's with him?

04:01.934 --> 04:02.935
He's not a suspect.

04:03.002 --> 04:04.103
We already cleared him.

04:04.170 --> 04:06.105
But he's an asshole.

04:06.172 --> 04:07.039
I know.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.053
Well, looky who it is.

04:23.256 --> 04:25.791
I ain't doin' a
thing wrong, officer.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.895
What you want, huh?

04:30.528 --> 04:32.832
You want to come look at
my little girl's grave?

04:34.300 --> 04:37.402
And how many times you been
here since you got her killed?

04:38.771 --> 04:41.974
Oh, you got Brie all worked
up about serving her country,

04:42.041 --> 04:44.076
left her poor mother
at home to suffer.

04:44.143 --> 04:46.178
And now they're
both fuckin' dead.

04:47.046 --> 04:48.413
Put the beer away, Cal.

04:49.949 --> 04:50.816
Go home.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.009
Finnick.

05:50.977 --> 05:51.844
You're up.

06:44.730 --> 06:46.065
Major.

06:49.402 --> 06:51.037
Torch, this is Paladin.

06:51.103 --> 06:53.305
Paladin, this is Torch.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.673
We have the package.

07:00.880 --> 07:01.747
No!

07:01.814 --> 07:04.784
No!

07:04.850 --> 07:06.719
Let's go!

07:44.457 --> 07:45.791
I order you to breathe.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.126
Look, you cannot die.

07:47.193 --> 07:48.027
You cannot die.

07:48.094 --> 07:49.695
I need you here.

07:49.762 --> 07:50.696
I need you.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.966
I mean, your dad
and, you know, Ellis.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.401
No, no, no.

07:55.468 --> 07:57.336
No, you breathe, dammit.

07:57.403 --> 07:59.004
Brie!

07:59.071 --> 08:00.039
Brie.

08:00.106 --> 08:03.342
Brie, no, look at
me, look at me.

08:03.409 --> 08:04.810
Brie.

08:37.409 --> 08:39.812
Detectives, what've we got?

08:42.148 --> 08:45.351
We got Raj Dalal,
36 years old,

08:45.417 --> 08:47.186
Rachelle Winston's boyfriend,

08:47.253 --> 08:49.088
the girl whose body we
found in the cemetery.

08:49.155 --> 08:50.022
Oh.

08:51.824 --> 08:53.259
Is he her killer?

08:53.325 --> 08:55.060
I don't know, Chief, but, uh,

08:56.428 --> 08:58.030
he's definitely
hiding somethin'.

08:58.097 --> 09:00.900
I mean, wow.

09:02.234 --> 09:05.337
We got a call for a B and
E, over at Cherrywood Estates.

09:06.372 --> 09:08.307
When we arrived on the location,

09:08.374 --> 09:11.877
we found Raj over here
hiding in a woodshed.

09:11.944 --> 09:14.847
You think because
maybe he whacked his girlfriend?

09:14.914 --> 09:16.148
Show him the piece, man.

09:17.383 --> 09:19.518
Found this little
pea-shooter here.

09:19.585 --> 09:21.921
Didn't even take a single shot.

09:21.987 --> 09:23.289
You think he did it, Chief?

09:24.857 --> 09:25.724
No.

09:27.826 --> 09:29.862
Look at this guy.

09:29.929 --> 09:31.163
He's terrified in there.

09:31.230 --> 09:32.865
He's about to piss himself.

09:32.932 --> 09:33.599
Definitely.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.335
I'm Detective O'Connor.

09:36.402 --> 09:38.437
This is Detective Alayoubi.

09:38.504 --> 09:40.973
We're with the Lake Orion PD.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.776
We'd like to ask you
a series of questions.

09:43.842 --> 09:46.445
Can you please state your
name and age for the record?

09:47.580 --> 09:49.949
Raj Dalal, 36.

09:50.015 --> 09:52.985
Raj, do you know
why you're here?

09:53.052 --> 09:54.086
No.

09:54.153 --> 09:56.388
Can you tell me
about Rachelle Winston?

09:56.455 --> 09:58.324
You were her boyfriend, right?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.859
We just hung out
a couple of times.

10:00.926 --> 10:02.928
Let's take this step by step.

10:02.995 --> 10:04.263
Where were you, last night?

10:06.865 --> 10:08.467
You guys
wouldn't believe me.

10:08.534 --> 10:10.102
Try us.

10:10.169 --> 10:11.270
We're the good guys.

10:13.973 --> 10:15.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

10:15.274 --> 10:16.041
English, please.

10:16.108 --> 10:18.712
I saw a devil, last night.

10:20.045 --> 10:22.948
We were just hanging out
by, by the Oakwood Cemetery,

10:23.015 --> 10:25.150
and this creature, man,
just came out of nowhere

10:25.217 --> 10:27.820
with glowing eyes, a tail,

10:27.886 --> 10:29.188
screams like a banshee.

10:31.457 --> 10:32.524
It killed her, man.

10:33.525 --> 10:35.928
They call it Nain Rouge.

10:35.995 --> 10:37.429
It killed her, man.

10:38.897 --> 10:39.832
It killed her.

10:39.898 --> 10:40.933
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.968
so you're telling me
you saw a creature

10:43.035 --> 10:45.938
with glowing eyes and a tail?

10:46.005 --> 10:46.905
That's what you're telling me?

10:46.972 --> 10:47.806
Yes.

10:49.408 --> 10:51.343
You believe this
fuckin' guy, partner?

10:55.180 --> 10:58.083
Did you kill Rachelle Winston?

10:58.150 --> 11:01.320
No, I didn't kill,
I didn't kill her.

11:02.354 --> 11:04.223
Nain Rouge killed her.

11:05.357 --> 11:06.292
Trust me.

11:06.358 --> 11:07.593
Trust you?

11:07.661 --> 11:09.461
I need a lawyer.

11:09.528 --> 11:11.530
That's the smartest thing
you said all day, today.

11:11.597 --> 11:13.232
Thanks for wasting our time.

11:14.600 --> 11:15.401
Get the fuck out.

11:38.957 --> 11:42.127
I didn't want her
to go back down there.

11:42.194 --> 11:43.929
I tried to keep her here.

11:45.064 --> 11:47.333
I knew she was running
with a bad crowd,

11:47.399 --> 11:49.636
a real bad crowd.

11:49.703 --> 11:52.071
Had she been living
in the city long?

11:52.137 --> 11:53.839
I, I think so.

11:55.607 --> 11:58.043
We haven't talked much
in the past few months,

11:59.178 --> 12:00.245
not like we used to.

12:01.648 --> 12:04.149
She only comes around
when she wants money.

12:04.216 --> 12:07.453
I just, I just couldn't
talk to her anymore.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.520
But the last time that she came,

12:08.587 --> 12:12.524
I felt like I, I had
to make her stay.

12:15.194 --> 12:18.964
But she wouldn't listen.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.065
That was a week ago.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.502
And now she's gone.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.271
My little girl is gone.

12:27.239 --> 12:29.475
We'll find who
did this, Wendy.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.076
We'll find him.

12:49.395 --> 12:51.930
Don't tell me this is
some contract hit, Chief.

12:53.465 --> 12:57.302
Billie Jean, you
find me some witnesses,

12:57.369 --> 12:58.470
and I'll hear your case

12:58.537 --> 13:01.373
about some serial killer
hiding up in the area.

13:02.675 --> 13:06.578
Until then, this
is an inside hit.

13:06.646 --> 13:08.380
I'm sure of it,

13:08.447 --> 13:10.082
just like the one before.

13:11.216 --> 13:12.985
You heard Wendy.

13:13.051 --> 13:16.188
That girl was running around
with a powerful city gang.

13:17.489 --> 13:19.491
Yeah, well, troubled kids
in small towns do, sir.

13:19.558 --> 13:20.993
And I'm telling you,

13:21.059 --> 13:23.228
there's something
bigger going on here.

13:23.295 --> 13:24.163
I feel it.

15:05.732 --> 15:07.065
Are you okay?

15:07.834 --> 15:10.302
It's a monster.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.236
It's here.

15:12.906 --> 15:15.642
It's living in the woods
beyond my property.

15:15.708 --> 15:17.309
I saw it.

15:17.376 --> 15:18.477
Anna Lee, I am not the person

15:18.544 --> 15:21.213
to be acting like this
in front of, all right?

15:21.881 --> 15:23.115
Come with me now.

15:23.181 --> 15:24.583
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

15:49.676 --> 15:51.510
I'm really not gonna be
that man, I'm just sayin'.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.211
Finnick, what's up, sexy?

15:54.948 --> 15:56.716
Oh, shit.

15:56.783 --> 15:58.617
You're gonna get
throat punched.

15:58.685 --> 16:00.285
And you're mean.

16:00.352 --> 16:01.420
Sit the fuck down.

16:01.486 --> 16:02.822
- Don't tell me to sit down.
- Sit, troll.

16:02.889 --> 16:04.356
I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.490
Why, why?

16:06.626 --> 16:07.694
I'm not two.

16:07.760 --> 16:08.795
Anyway.

16:08.861 --> 16:11.563
Finnick, I got the
Winston case files.

16:12.431 --> 16:13.498
What do you think?

16:13.565 --> 16:15.200
You think it's a gang
or something bigger?

16:16.301 --> 16:17.302
Something bigger?

16:17.369 --> 16:18.270
What could be bigger?

16:18.337 --> 16:20.707
All the stuff
we've been through,

16:20.773 --> 16:22.274
we've seen some shit.

16:22.341 --> 16:23.843
Yeah, but that was war.

16:23.910 --> 16:25.177
Okay, that wasn't here.

16:25.243 --> 16:28.447
At least in war, you know
who your enemy is and why.

16:29.581 --> 16:31.283
And you don't think
that can happen here?

16:33.385 --> 16:35.420
Desperate times,
desperate measures?

16:37.356 --> 16:38.390
Have you ever heard
of the Nain Rouge?

16:40.392 --> 16:41.393
Yeah, I think we have.

16:41.460 --> 16:42.762
I mean, we have a
witness back there

16:42.829 --> 16:45.330
that I fucking just beamed
his head off the damn table,

16:45.397 --> 16:46.933
talkin' about a
little red devil,

16:47.000 --> 16:48.701
pointy ears, long tail, yeah.

16:48.768 --> 16:49.636
He's full of shit.

16:49.702 --> 16:51.470
What, you believe it?

16:51.536 --> 16:52.805
I don't believe any of it.

16:52.872 --> 16:53.740
You don't believe it?

16:53.806 --> 16:55.307
No.

16:55.374 --> 16:57.476
I mean, I'm not
saying I believe it.

16:57.542 --> 16:58.543
But there's a lot of coincidence

16:58.610 --> 17:00.947
and a lot of talk
around town about it.

17:01.014 --> 17:04.348
That doesn't mean I believe
in demons and monsters.

17:04.415 --> 17:06.617
We need to get to the
bottom of this, okay?

17:06.685 --> 17:08.487
I believe we need
to figure it out.

17:10.355 --> 17:11.023
We're on it.

17:11.089 --> 17:12.156
Get to work, ladies.

17:13.660 --> 17:15.527
She's fuckin' high.

17:29.976 --> 17:31.678
Officer, officer!

17:31.744 --> 17:32.879
Officer, you need
to get over there.

17:32.945 --> 17:34.212
This
motherfucker killed somebody.

17:34.279 --> 17:35.213
- You guys called this in?
- Yeah, we called it in.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.050
- All right.
- There's a motherfucker

17:37.116 --> 17:38.151
and dragged the body back there.

17:38.216 --> 17:39.184
- Calm down.
- There's blood everywhere.

17:39.251 --> 17:40.318
Calm down, tell
me what you saw.

17:40.385 --> 17:42.621
A man just dragged
his body back there.

17:42.689 --> 17:43.656
There's blood in the
back of the chapel.

17:43.723 --> 17:44.824
There's freakin'
blood everywhere.

17:44.891 --> 17:45.424
It looked like Hannibal
Lecter and some shit.

17:45.490 --> 17:46.258
Okay, where?

17:46.324 --> 17:48.427
He just dragged him inside.

17:48.493 --> 17:49.494
- It's everywhere.
- Look, I'm from Detroit,

17:49.561 --> 17:50.562
and I ain't never
seen shit like that.

17:50.630 --> 17:51.229
- Where?
- In the back of the chapel.

17:51.296 --> 17:51.831
Stay right here.

18:29.836 --> 18:34.841
Freeze!

18:36.709 --> 18:37.576
Shit.

18:39.979 --> 18:41.080
Radio 502.

18:43.049 --> 18:44.951
I've got an active
homicide at this location.

18:45.017 --> 18:48.487
Back-up
units, right now.

18:54.627 --> 18:56.028
Oh my gosh, Billie, you okay?

18:56.095 --> 18:56.863
Yeah, I'm good.

18:56.929 --> 18:57.997
You had shots fired there.

18:58.064 --> 18:59.564
Yeah, three of 'em.

18:59.632 --> 19:00.900
And I know I hit him.

19:02.034 --> 19:05.337
Chief, it's been years
since the last homicide.

19:06.404 --> 19:07.874
I've never seen
anything this brutal,

19:07.940 --> 19:09.474
not even in combat.

19:22.554 --> 19:24.589
Hey, DJ Godfather,
what's up, man?

19:24.657 --> 19:25.892
Hey, what up, man?

19:25.958 --> 19:27.559
Have you seen this guy?

19:27.627 --> 19:28.761
Yeah, he's a regular.

19:28.828 --> 19:30.562
Corner booth, right over there.

19:30.630 --> 19:31.697
I fuckin' knew it.

19:31.764 --> 19:32.597
Come on, let's go.

19:43.709 --> 19:44.476
When's the last time

19:44.543 --> 19:46.679
you played with pyrotechnics?

19:48.080 --> 19:50.582
You know, I was really
starting to get to know her.

19:50.650 --> 19:51.951
Really don't give a shit.

19:52.985 --> 19:55.121
She's an art history major.

19:55.188 --> 19:58.390
What do you know about
a crackhead named Ike?

20:01.627 --> 20:03.696
I think both of you are
way out of your jurisdiction.

20:03.763 --> 20:05.865
Can you believe
this fuckin' guy?

20:05.932 --> 20:07.133
Don't worry, Marcellus,

20:07.200 --> 20:08.734
we already filled out
our deconfliction report.

20:12.504 --> 20:13.505
I'm not gonna have the answers

20:13.572 --> 20:15.675
for the questions
you're gonna ask.

20:15.741 --> 20:18.510
Neither of you have any idea who

20:18.577 --> 20:20.680
or what you are fucking with.

20:20.746 --> 20:23.749
I don't give a shit
about your daddy.

20:23.816 --> 20:24.616
You understand that?

20:24.684 --> 20:26.451
Look at me, I don't give a shit.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.453
It's got nothing
to do with him.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.554
What are you gonna do,

20:29.621 --> 20:30.422
tell us a story about
a little red devil?

20:30.488 --> 20:31.356
- What the...
- Whoa, whoa!

20:31.423 --> 20:34.827
Don't be stupid,
don't be stupid.

20:34.894 --> 20:36.028
- Who told you?
- Walk away.

20:47.907 --> 20:49.675
- Hey, Billie.
- Hey.

20:54.512 --> 20:56.048
- Hey, Billie.
- Hey.

20:59.785 --> 21:00.653
You called, Chief?

21:01.787 --> 21:04.456
Hey, Billie, come
on in and have a seat.

21:04.522 --> 21:07.126
Give you one guess
where our victim's from.

21:07.193 --> 21:12.098
25-year-old male,
low-level hood rat,

21:12.164 --> 21:15.001
runs around with a group
called, you ready for it?

21:15.067 --> 21:17.703
The Corpses, kinda
fitting now, isn't it?

21:18.638 --> 21:20.907
This is guy is a wanted felon,

21:20.973 --> 21:24.043
wanted for weapons and
firearms violations.

21:24.110 --> 21:25.111
He's got a criminal history

21:25.177 --> 21:27.914
you could wallpaper
your bathroom with.

21:27.980 --> 21:30.082
What do we say about these
guys around town, Billie?

21:30.149 --> 21:31.549
Play stupid games...

21:31.616 --> 21:33.551
Win stupid prizes.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.587
What the hell is
he doing out here?

21:35.655 --> 21:37.723
No clue, but this much I know,

21:37.790 --> 21:39.258
whatever he was doin',

21:39.325 --> 21:40.693
he's not doin' it no more.

21:41.894 --> 21:45.497
Probably a contract hit,
inter-gang violence,

21:45.563 --> 21:46.999
but somebody wanted him removed.

21:48.134 --> 21:49.467
Is the city
gonna get involved?

21:49.534 --> 21:53.105
No, the city doesn't give two
shits about a guy like this.

21:53.172 --> 21:55.074
He runs out of their
city and comes to ours

21:55.141 --> 21:57.910
and gets murdered, the
only thing they care about,

21:57.977 --> 21:59.278
he's off their radar.

21:59.345 --> 22:00.846
The mutilated that man.

22:02.281 --> 22:04.582
There's no way that
was some ordinary hit.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.886
It wasn't an
ordinary hit, Billie.

22:06.953 --> 22:08.821
He was mutilated.

22:08.888 --> 22:12.058
But the one thing you have
to remember, your focus,

22:12.124 --> 22:14.592
your attention is that
we have our own people,

22:15.728 --> 22:17.663
and with that, our own problems.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.736
Are we done?

22:23.803 --> 22:27.173
We are, just read the
case and know the file.

22:27.239 --> 22:28.140
Yes, Chief.

25:03.329 --> 25:05.097
Please accept these
special shell-casings

25:05.164 --> 25:07.032
as a reminder of
this shot volley

25:07.099 --> 25:08.234
in honor of your
daughter's commitment

25:08.300 --> 25:11.170
to our freedom, by
entering the Armed Forces.

25:53.445 --> 25:54.480
If you have any questions,

25:54.547 --> 25:56.315
the court phone
number's on the bottom.

25:56.382 --> 25:57.316
Have a better day.

26:11.997 --> 26:13.866
Radio 502, cleared traffic.

26:33.919 --> 26:35.854
Pastor Wilhem,
how are you today?

26:35.921 --> 26:38.157
Officer Finnick,
I'm good, thank you.

26:39.291 --> 26:43.395
As always, I feel the
current temperament

26:44.296 --> 26:45.798
of the people of Lake Orion,

26:46.932 --> 26:49.735
but today, as in
the past few days,

26:51.971 --> 26:53.372
we're very concerned

26:53.439 --> 26:55.074
and especially frustrated.

26:57.142 --> 26:59.345
Is there anything I can
say to the congregation,

26:59.411 --> 27:03.882
any news at all, about
this sordid mess,

27:05.017 --> 27:06.585
the accident that
took several lives,

27:06.653 --> 27:09.154
even of someone not so innocent?

27:09.221 --> 27:11.523
Well, you know, we share
in your frustration, Pastor.

27:12.626 --> 27:13.959
This definitely
wasn't an accident.

27:14.026 --> 27:15.894
It's been ruled a homicide.

27:15.961 --> 27:19.231
And we are currently pursuing
all leads for suspects.

27:19.298 --> 27:24.303
Aside from the low-income
crime which we deal with here,

27:25.604 --> 27:28.807
the last thing our youth needs

27:30.175 --> 27:33.045
is the immeasurable
negative impact

27:34.380 --> 27:37.216
of the gang activity and the
drug abuse and the prostitution

27:38.550 --> 27:41.287
which runs rampant in
that horrible place.

29:12.478 --> 29:13.345
Mulder.

29:14.346 --> 29:15.981
Mulder.

29:47.413 --> 29:48.280
Major?

29:50.382 --> 29:52.117
Now that's a
voice I haven't heard from,

29:52.184 --> 29:53.986
in a long time.

29:54.052 --> 29:56.155
What can I do for you, Finnick?

29:56.221 --> 29:58.390
I've got big trouble
in a small town, sir.

30:31.825 --> 30:33.025
Thank you, officers.

30:33.091 --> 30:37.129
Please follow me right this
way to the crime scene.

30:46.605 --> 30:49.141
This is our Native
American exhibit,

30:49.208 --> 30:50.976
where the crime was initiated.

30:53.111 --> 30:54.446
Will you follow me
to the concourse?

30:54.513 --> 30:55.347
Sure.

31:01.386 --> 31:05.658
You know, Dr. Sudhir
is curator, of course,

31:05.725 --> 31:09.194
and, um, he knows a lot
about this situation,

31:09.261 --> 31:12.331
and he could probably
explain it better than I.

31:14.466 --> 31:17.704
I keep an eye on our city's
most important artifacts.

31:17.770 --> 31:19.471
But something's slipped
through the cracks,

31:19.538 --> 31:20.472
from what I understand.

31:22.608 --> 31:27.079
Oh, yes, a most
unfortunate crime.

31:27.145 --> 31:31.283
It was done close to around
midnight, well planned.

31:33.218 --> 31:35.187
Nightingale, what does this
have to do with Lake Orion?

31:36.288 --> 31:39.358
It's fear, officer,
fear of pain,

31:39.424 --> 31:42.127
fear of death, fear
of the unknown,

31:43.462 --> 31:45.732
were you to have
this here knife,

31:47.366 --> 31:49.201
and others saw possibilities.

31:51.738 --> 31:53.640
I'm not following.

31:53.706 --> 31:58.544
The knife is a weapon that
was forged in fire and blood,

31:58.610 --> 32:01.280
by the Native Americans,
South Michigan.

32:02.581 --> 32:06.285
Chief Pontiac himself carved
the knife from the bone

32:06.351 --> 32:09.822
of the wolf that was
killed by a French soldier.

32:10.857 --> 32:12.491
The knife in
question was a weapon

32:12.558 --> 32:13.893
of the Ottawa Indian tribe

32:13.960 --> 32:16.663
who prospered like
thousands of years ago,

32:16.729 --> 32:18.765
in and around the area
we're standing on, today.

32:18.831 --> 32:23.235
Now the knife is said to
endow the one who holds it

32:23.302 --> 32:27.372
with a protector, a
ruthless guardian angel.

32:27.439 --> 32:29.608
And it would give them warning,

32:29.676 --> 32:33.345
share the land and
take only what you need

32:33.412 --> 32:36.749
and do not destroy
to live, or else.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.786
Unfortunately for
those French settlers,

32:41.888 --> 32:45.792
our great city, they
did not heed the words

32:45.858 --> 32:49.696
of what they called
the Nain Rouge,

32:49.762 --> 32:53.098
and Detroit has suffered
for it, ever since.

32:53.967 --> 32:56.368
If you are holding the knife,

32:56.435 --> 32:58.537
it may even come for you.

32:58.604 --> 33:02.574
But if you are not the
one who summoned it,

33:02.642 --> 33:03.676
it will kill you.

33:04.576 --> 33:06.311
So be warned.

33:06.378 --> 33:10.482
You may only have this
one chance to stop it.

33:11.651 --> 33:13.686
The book suggests

33:13.753 --> 33:15.788
that one has to strike the knife

33:16.923 --> 33:20.325
in the back of its
neck, to banish it.

33:25.263 --> 33:26.866
It makes sense.

33:26.933 --> 33:28.835
You know, a couple
of months ago,

33:30.670 --> 33:33.740
there was a murder,
particularly gruesome murder,

33:33.806 --> 33:35.307
top-tier gangster.

33:37.376 --> 33:40.312
He hadn't been shot,
stabbed, tortured,

33:40.379 --> 33:41.580
nothing like that.

33:42.715 --> 33:45.752
He'd been torn to
shreds, Finnick.

33:45.818 --> 33:47.285
I mean torn to shreds.

33:48.054 --> 33:50.522
Man, after that,

33:52.324 --> 33:53.191
every other day,

33:54.259 --> 33:57.529
four or five times
a week, same thing.

33:58.698 --> 34:03.402
That knife was used
to summon a demon.

34:04.302 --> 34:05.772
Who would summon this thing?

34:05.838 --> 34:06.939
Why?

34:07.006 --> 34:08.141
Who knows?

34:08.206 --> 34:10.375
I mean, payback, somebody
wants to get even,

34:10.442 --> 34:11.744
right a wrong, I don't know,

34:11.811 --> 34:15.648
but what I do know is this
thing has gotten out of hand,

34:15.715 --> 34:18.350
and we have to find that knife.

35:19.779 --> 35:20.646
Hello.

35:22.481 --> 35:23.916
Who is this?

35:23.983 --> 35:26.585
Wait, wait,
wait, hold on, calm down.

35:26.652 --> 35:29.321
Calm down, look, lower your
voice, lower your voice.

35:29.387 --> 35:30.489
Where the fuck are you?

36:00.552 --> 36:02.989
I had this, this
gorgeous, this, this,

36:03.055 --> 36:05.423
this beautiful turkey sandwich

36:05.490 --> 36:06.759
with all the trimmings.

36:06.826 --> 36:10.428
I'm talkin' about lettuce,
tomatoes, yellow peppers,

36:11.563 --> 36:14.000
a little hint of salt
and pepper, mayo.

36:14.066 --> 36:15.668
And this wasn't
some supermarket,

36:15.735 --> 36:18.370
thin-cut slice of
processed bullshit.

36:18.436 --> 36:19.772
This that thick-cut turkey,

36:19.839 --> 36:21.540
the kind they get
me from Canada.

36:21.606 --> 36:23.109
Talk about a trade deal.

36:23.176 --> 36:24.811
So what do I do?

36:24.877 --> 36:27.747
I wrap it up, and I put
it in the refrigerator.

36:28.881 --> 36:31.017
But you know that shit's
not gonna hold, right?

36:31.083 --> 36:32.317
I wouldn't have
called you out here

36:32.384 --> 36:33.418
- if it wasn't serious.
- Lettuce gonna get all moist.

36:33.485 --> 36:36.656
Bread's gonna soak
up part of the mayo.

36:36.722 --> 36:38.024
I don't take it with me,

36:38.090 --> 36:41.961
'cause I don't wanna risk
spilling it on my $3,000 suit,

36:42.028 --> 36:45.865
but when my son calls, I
drop everything, don't I?

36:47.733 --> 36:49.669
Listen, some serious
shit is gonna go down...

36:49.735 --> 36:52.004
Don't say another
goddamned word.

36:53.739 --> 36:54.941
I only got less than one week

36:55.007 --> 36:56.843
before I put all
my ducks in a row,

36:56.909 --> 36:59.045
and you're just a
duck waitin' to quack.

36:59.111 --> 37:00.213
What, you think I'm
gonna go out there

37:00.279 --> 37:01.948
and start tellin'
everybody about what we do?

37:02.014 --> 37:02.982
- You fuck up...
- I'm gonna sacrifice...

37:03.049 --> 37:05.785
And you fuck up,
and you fuck up,

37:05.852 --> 37:07.419
and I handle it, don't I?

37:08.553 --> 37:09.621
You were supposed to
be right by my side,

37:09.689 --> 37:12.692
standing right next
to me, father and son.

37:12.758 --> 37:14.559
I mean, hell, we could've been.

37:14.627 --> 37:15.962
- But here we are, right?
- It's another lifetime.

37:16.028 --> 37:17.830
Time and time, again.

37:17.897 --> 37:19.098
This time, it's different.

37:19.165 --> 37:20.532
Oh, it is?

37:20.599 --> 37:21.701
Listen, some
heavy shit is about

37:21.767 --> 37:22.802
to happen in your jurisdiction.

37:22.869 --> 37:23.636
I need your help.

37:23.703 --> 37:24.937
Let me tell you something.

37:25.004 --> 37:28.440
Me meetin' you here, in
this town, in this place,

37:28.506 --> 37:31.443
I mean, wow,
you must've really fucked up royally.

37:36.215 --> 37:37.917
I came here to meet
you face to face,

37:37.984 --> 37:38.951
to tell you one more time,

37:39.018 --> 37:39.952
that you not gettin'
no more favors

37:40.019 --> 37:43.823
from dear, old
Dad, nothing, nada.

37:43.890 --> 37:44.991
We're done.

37:45.057 --> 37:47.059
That's what you drove
all the way here for?

37:47.126 --> 37:48.661
I'm gonna be watchin' you.

37:50.062 --> 37:53.132
And if you ever dare to speak
about what I've done for you,

37:53.199 --> 37:55.101
boy, oh, boy, it's
gonna be crucial.

37:56.636 --> 37:58.070
Welcome back to channel
eight, "Talk Detroit."

37:58.137 --> 37:59.138
I'm Jay Towers.

37:59.205 --> 38:00.940
Here with us now is
Sheriff John Wayne.

38:01.007 --> 38:02.607
Sheriff, thanks for
being here today.

38:02.675 --> 38:03.910
Jay, thanks for having me.

38:03.976 --> 38:07.980
Recently, reports of a
number of gruesome murders

38:08.047 --> 38:11.684
in the Lake Orion area have
left many residents worried

38:11.751 --> 38:13.052
about their safety.

38:13.119 --> 38:15.988
Over the past few months, police
have been tracking two men

38:16.055 --> 38:18.523
on charges of kidnapping
and armed robbery.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.761
Both of the suspects
were recently found dead

38:21.827 --> 38:24.163
in what some Lake Orion
residents are seeing

38:24.230 --> 38:26.966
as a form of street justice.

38:31.237 --> 38:32.772
Now where did this all start?

38:32.838 --> 38:34.539
Well, we
have a few open cases

38:34.606 --> 38:36.175
from Detroit, going
back a few months,

38:36.242 --> 38:39.245
and we've linked that to
this unknown assailant.

38:39.312 --> 38:41.513
So is it
safe for us to assume

38:41.579 --> 38:43.015
that this is the
work of an individual

38:43.082 --> 38:44.616
and not a group of people?

38:44.684 --> 38:46.218
Well, we're seeing
a similar pattern,

38:46.285 --> 38:47.552
an M.O., if you will,

38:47.619 --> 38:50.923
and details have emerged
that link this all together.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.759
Our investigation has
kinda led us down the path

38:53.826 --> 38:56.862
to believe we're looking
at a single suspect.

38:56.929 --> 38:58.998
You know, there
was another gruesome death,

38:59.065 --> 39:00.299
last week, in Old Town.

39:00.366 --> 39:03.769
The victim was part of a
group called The Corpses.

39:03.836 --> 39:04.904
Have you heard of them?

39:04.971 --> 39:06.571
Oh, yeah, we're
familiar with them.

39:06.639 --> 39:07.873
Any connection there?

39:07.940 --> 39:09.241
Perhaps, it would
seem to fit the pattern,

39:09.308 --> 39:12.144
but at this point, I would
say nothing's been confirmed.

39:12.211 --> 39:14.180
Some residents
are hypothesizing...

39:14.246 --> 39:15.681
Staff Sergeant Finnick.

39:17.283 --> 39:19.218
Trade in uniforms, huh?

39:20.753 --> 39:21.821
Well, I failed
at the last one,

39:21.887 --> 39:24.991
so maybe I can right
my wrongs, this time.

39:25.925 --> 39:26.792
Please stop.

39:28.194 --> 39:29.862
Why do you do that to yourself?

39:31.030 --> 39:33.766
You know you had nothing
to do with Brie's death.

39:33.833 --> 39:36.635
I had everything
to do with it.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.976
Look, you got to
stop blaming yourself.

39:44.043 --> 39:45.244
You need to move past it.

39:47.413 --> 39:49.849
You cannot harbor
the resentment.

39:53.386 --> 39:54.586
I was her NCO.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.056
I was supposed to protect
her, and I, I didn't.

39:58.391 --> 39:59.492
I don't care
about labels, okay.

39:59.557 --> 40:02.194
I don't care what your
name is in the Army.

40:02.261 --> 40:03.863
You guys have been inseparable

40:04.964 --> 40:06.866
since you were little kids.

40:06.932 --> 40:08.000
We grew up together.

40:09.335 --> 40:12.071
You guys went over there
fighting for the same thing.

40:13.172 --> 40:17.943
Blood everywhere,
totally killed my buzz.

40:18.010 --> 40:18.778
It was crazy, man.

40:18.844 --> 40:19.812
Can you believe this shit?

40:19.879 --> 40:20.612
Yeah, he was
hanging upside down,

40:20.679 --> 40:22.181
like a bat in an alleyway.

40:22.248 --> 40:23.449
You gotta do something.

40:23.516 --> 40:24.549
You gotta hide your
wives and hide your kids.

40:24.616 --> 40:27.353
You know, the Nain
Rouge is gonna get you.

40:27.420 --> 40:30.990
Some residents are hypothesizing
that something animal

40:31.057 --> 40:33.626
or inhuman was responsible
for these deaths.

40:33.692 --> 40:36.028
I mean, is there
anything to that?

40:36.095 --> 40:37.930
You know, given the
injuries to these victims,

40:37.997 --> 40:40.866
I understand how people are
jumping to those conclusions,

40:40.933 --> 40:42.101
and we're not
ruling anything out.

40:42.168 --> 40:45.037
But I would say, definitively,
we're not looking

40:45.104 --> 40:48.174
for some kind of
creature of folklore.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.743
You know anything about it?

40:50.810 --> 40:51.644
No.

40:53.212 --> 40:55.848
No, if I see something,
I'll say something.

40:55.915 --> 40:58.784
You'll be the first to know.

40:58.851 --> 41:00.019
What about you?

41:00.986 --> 41:02.822
Not a damn thing.

41:02.888 --> 41:03.889
Nothin' makes sense.

41:05.891 --> 41:07.226
Yeah, apparently.

41:09.361 --> 41:10.729
I saw your dad, today.

41:14.266 --> 41:17.203
I guess that's why you
haven't been around yet, huh?

41:17.269 --> 41:18.804
Where at?

41:18.871 --> 41:20.005
Just while I was out.

41:21.273 --> 41:22.341
I love my father,

41:24.510 --> 41:26.946
but he can be a real
piece of shit, sometimes.

41:27.947 --> 41:29.048
And I'm sorry for that.

41:31.417 --> 41:33.919
He loved me like you
guys, you and Brie.

41:41.060 --> 41:42.461
Come on, Penny.

41:42.528 --> 41:44.096
Come on, come on.

41:44.163 --> 41:44.997
Watch your step.

41:46.398 --> 41:48.334
Welcome to the
Palace of Solitude.

41:53.405 --> 41:56.008
Wow, this looks
totally different.

41:57.943 --> 42:00.379
Well, you know, my dad's
not around that much anymore.

42:02.248 --> 42:03.382
Made it my own.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.922
But it's a living.

42:14.026 --> 42:15.027
They're beautiful.

42:18.130 --> 42:19.331
What happened?

42:19.398 --> 42:21.066
You were never this
forthcoming when we were kids.

42:22.034 --> 42:23.269
Well, it took me a while,

42:23.335 --> 42:25.838
gettin' comfortable with
being an artist, you know.

42:25.905 --> 42:28.707
I mean, the whole time I was
in the city, it was tough.

42:30.242 --> 42:32.912
It's not a place to
get your head straight.

42:32.978 --> 42:37.116
And then my mom died,
and I was at the point

42:37.183 --> 42:39.985
where I couldn't see
any end, no tomorrow.

42:41.220 --> 42:44.256
I, uh, kinda got lost in drugs,

42:45.958 --> 42:46.926
got really violent.

42:49.361 --> 42:51.130
I almost didn't
make it out alive.

42:53.098 --> 42:56.001
Wow, this is all
such a surprise to me.

42:57.002 --> 42:57.836
Yeah.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.774
Yeah, coming back home
was the only move I had.

43:01.840 --> 43:02.942
I'm still working on my dad,

43:03.008 --> 43:05.177
but with the pastor's
help, we'll get there.

43:05.244 --> 43:06.312
Pastor Wilhem?

43:06.378 --> 43:08.080
Yeah, he's a lifesaver.

43:20.092 --> 43:20.993
Starsky and Hutch.

43:21.060 --> 43:21.860
What's up, Chief?

43:21.927 --> 43:23.729
Just the guys I'm lookin' for.

43:24.930 --> 43:26.198
How you doin'?

43:27.566 --> 43:29.902
Hey, we got a positive ID
on that guy you were chasing

43:29.969 --> 43:31.237
through the woods, last night.

43:31.303 --> 43:32.338
Yeah, what the
fuck happened, last night?

43:32.404 --> 43:33.138
Nothing good.

43:33.205 --> 43:34.940
It's a Marcellus De Vaux.

43:35.007 --> 43:36.742
He's a local shithead, you know.

43:38.444 --> 43:41.113
Did you just say
Marcellus De Vaux?

43:41.180 --> 43:42.348
I been chasin'
this piece of shit

43:42.414 --> 43:44.216
for the past couple of years.

43:44.283 --> 43:47.086
Well, now's our chance,
but here's the thing.

43:47.152 --> 43:50.089
He's very well connected
with Mayor Flynn.

43:50.155 --> 43:52.024
Chief, mayor or no mayor,

43:52.091 --> 43:53.859
I don't give a fuck
who his daddy is.

43:53.926 --> 43:56.362
I get it, I get it,
but this is a minefield.

43:56.428 --> 43:59.365
I need you guys to get
his ass, but step easy

43:59.431 --> 44:00.833
and don't blow
anything up, okay?

44:00.899 --> 44:02.234
Yes, sir.

44:02.301 --> 44:03.102
Come on, baby, oh.

44:07.473 --> 44:09.475
It's almost ready, baby.

44:12.444 --> 44:14.146
Hey, hey, Ike.

44:15.447 --> 44:16.782
It's me, Simon.

44:18.284 --> 44:19.151
Ike?

44:20.619 --> 44:21.887
Guess what day it is.

44:23.289 --> 44:24.890
It's Devil's Night.

44:27.627 --> 44:29.261
That's right.

44:37.069 --> 44:39.538
You look like the cat
that ate the canary.

44:41.106 --> 44:42.875
What the fuck brings you here?

44:42.941 --> 44:43.609
Hi.

44:45.712 --> 44:47.112
Can I get you anything?

44:48.147 --> 44:49.415
Beer, cigarette?

44:51.617 --> 44:53.653
How 'bout your
decorator's phone number?

44:53.720 --> 44:55.154
Ah, don't be a dick.

44:56.488 --> 44:58.357
No, but seriously,
what brings you here?

44:59.591 --> 45:02.261
I need something
small, packs a punch,

45:03.329 --> 45:04.296
something that goes bang.

45:08.100 --> 45:09.568
Well, I would offer
up Candy over here,

45:09.636 --> 45:11.170
but she's all mine.

45:12.471 --> 45:14.473
You wanna help him out, babe?

45:14.540 --> 45:15.441
Right this way.

45:19.011 --> 45:20.245
I'll be right with you.

45:25.117 --> 45:26.618
You seen the newspapers?

45:26.686 --> 45:28.120
You seen the front pages?

45:29.621 --> 45:31.890
Five deaths in 24 hours.

45:32.659 --> 45:34.360
I don't give a fuck.

45:34.426 --> 45:37.996
Yeah, well, two of
them were your own men.

45:40.633 --> 45:44.570
Listen, man, I don't know
how the hell they do it

45:44.637 --> 45:48.340
down there in Pine
Barrens, New Jersey,

45:48.407 --> 45:50.409
but here in Lake Orion,

45:51.510 --> 45:53.112
we gotta take care of our own.

46:00.252 --> 46:02.388
Is this what you wanted?

46:04.657 --> 46:05.457
Looks like it.

46:05.524 --> 46:07.226
Let me see if it's all here.

46:07.292 --> 46:08.961
Oh, it's all there.

46:10.229 --> 46:11.463
You know, Candy,
you're worth a lot more

46:11.530 --> 46:12.998
than Ike has to offer.

46:13.065 --> 46:16.669
Ah, this, it's working
for me right now.

46:19.639 --> 46:23.008
Well, just make sure
that you remember,

46:23.075 --> 46:25.645
you got a long
life ahead of you.

49:20.820 --> 49:23.221
Report
in, sector five.

49:23.288 --> 49:24.489
Come here, guys.

49:28.427 --> 49:29.428
Chief Pender!

49:29.494 --> 49:30.763
Chief, what've you got, man?

49:30.830 --> 49:31.731
Looks like a meth lab.

49:31.798 --> 49:32.598
Meth lab,
everybody, all right,

49:32.665 --> 49:35.434
500 feet, everybody's evacuated.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.602
Everybody's out.

49:36.669 --> 49:38.403
And as you're pullin'
them out, interview 'em.

49:38.470 --> 49:40.305
Let's find out
who these guys are

49:40.372 --> 49:41.741
and what they're
doing, all right?

49:41.808 --> 49:42.875
Sarge, thanks so
much for comin'.

49:42.942 --> 49:44.309
- We could use the help.
- Yeah, no problem.

49:44.376 --> 49:45.577
We got two guys on foot.

49:45.645 --> 49:46.679
We could sure use a guard.

49:46.746 --> 49:48.313
I'll get you one.

49:48.380 --> 49:49.414
Radio 30-03,

49:49.481 --> 49:51.751
- can I get a K9 out here?
- All right, guys.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.454
Chief, what the hell happened?

49:55.520 --> 49:56.588
Meth lab explosion.

49:56.656 --> 49:57.857
That's all we know.

49:57.924 --> 49:59.726
Two guys on foot.

49:59.792 --> 50:02.527
These guys are gonna be
evacuating the rest of the park.

50:02.594 --> 50:04.296
Sure could use some
help gettin' that done.

50:58.818 --> 51:01.654
This book contains anything

51:01.721 --> 51:04.757
and everything
you'll need to know

51:04.824 --> 51:06.324
about Nain Rouge.

51:58.778 --> 52:01.948
Detective, please, come on in.

52:02.014 --> 52:03.015
Mr. Mayor.

52:04.150 --> 52:07.019
This is Officer Finnick,
Lake Orion Police.

52:07.086 --> 52:08.221
Pleasure to meet you.

52:08.286 --> 52:09.421
- Thank you, sir.
- Assistin' us on this case.

52:09.488 --> 52:10.522
Thank you, thank you,
thank you for seeing me.

52:10.589 --> 52:13.059
I know it's a tad bit
unusual meetin' me

52:13.126 --> 52:14.994
without the chief present.

52:15.061 --> 52:16.696
Nothin' inappropriate, is it?

52:16.763 --> 52:19.098
Of course, it's only
a personal matter.

52:19.165 --> 52:20.532
Well, I don't do favors.

52:20.599 --> 52:22.635
Relax, Nightingale.

52:22.702 --> 52:24.871
You're a good man.

52:24.937 --> 52:26.005
You're an honest cop.

52:26.072 --> 52:27.807
No need to prove anything to me.

52:28.908 --> 52:30.076
Besides, you don't
even know what I wanted

52:30.143 --> 52:31.811
to meet with you about.

52:31.878 --> 52:35.715
This about your, um,
godson Marcel, is it?

52:36.649 --> 52:39.484
What was it, vandalism at 14,

52:39.551 --> 52:41.520
B-and-E at 15,

52:41.586 --> 52:45.357
got caught with an unregistered
weapon that same year,

52:46.959 --> 52:48.393
somethin' like that?

52:48.460 --> 52:49.862
All charges were dropped.

52:51.264 --> 52:54.499
You think you got all the
answers, don't you, Nightingale?

52:54.566 --> 52:55.433
That's my job.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.501
That's what I do.

52:56.568 --> 52:58.938
And I try to know
who I'm dealin' with.

52:59.005 --> 53:01.974
I'm a business
man, from Jersey,

53:02.041 --> 53:05.044
American made from
American goods.

53:06.179 --> 53:07.713
You see, I'm not
some rich asshole

53:07.780 --> 53:10.582
with a sports team or
some hometown gangster

53:10.650 --> 53:12.450
with a dozen hands
in his pockets.

53:14.120 --> 53:18.590
Look, all this bullshit about
the gangs, revenge wars,

53:18.658 --> 53:20.793
turf killings, whatever
you want to call it,

53:20.860 --> 53:22.762
it has nothin' to
do with my son.

53:24.030 --> 53:28.567
Look, your godson is
involved in this case,

53:28.634 --> 53:29.534
and that's a fact.

53:30.870 --> 53:32.872
The boy is just
runnin' scared,

53:33.840 --> 53:35.007
but he's no murderer.

53:47.753 --> 53:49.055
I have a possible
murder suspect

53:49.121 --> 53:50.957
in the abandoned
warehouse on Oak Street,

53:51.023 --> 53:51.958
asking for another unit.

53:54.627 --> 53:55.962
10-4, 501.

53:56.028 --> 53:58.463
There's another unit available
in the area of Oak Street,

53:58.530 --> 53:59.966
got your back, 501.

54:02.567 --> 54:03.836
502,
we're in the area.

54:03.903 --> 54:06.772
Two-man unit, we'll
be there in a second.

57:01.847 --> 57:02.715
Freeze!

57:07.353 --> 57:08.087
This is Finnick.

57:08.154 --> 57:10.689
I need backup on the roof.

57:52.131 --> 57:53.732
- Calm down, everyone.
- With all due respect,

57:53.799 --> 57:57.103
Madam Mayor, these
people deserve answers.

57:57.169 --> 58:00.106
I promise you, your
voices will be heard.

58:00.172 --> 58:04.043
We will hear from each and
every one of you, I promise.

58:10.116 --> 58:11.851
No, she won't!

58:11.917 --> 58:15.154
The Nain Rouge will kill us all!

58:37.943 --> 58:41.714
There have been 17 mysterious
deaths of local residents

58:41.780 --> 58:45.951
within the week, and our
community is at a great loss.

58:46.018 --> 58:49.421
Our council has laid
out a plan of action.

58:49.488 --> 58:50.789
If you would allow me,

58:50.856 --> 58:54.927
I'd like to introduce our
chief of police, Chief Romano.

58:54.994 --> 58:57.730
And lastly, effective
immediately,

58:57.796 --> 59:01.834
I have enacted a curfew,
from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m.,

59:01.901 --> 59:02.868
that's effective

59:02.935 --> 59:05.204
for all residents.

59:05.271 --> 59:06.138
Okay.

59:08.407 --> 59:11.377
Madam Mayor, the
people deserve a reprieve

59:11.443 --> 59:12.511
from all this chaos.

59:12.578 --> 59:14.747
This is bullshit!

59:14.813 --> 59:16.749
Folks, please.

59:16.815 --> 59:17.816
Hey, come on, folks!

59:18.484 --> 59:20.219
Folks, please.

59:20.286 --> 59:22.421
This isn't what you think.

59:22.488 --> 59:26.192
It's only in place
to keep you safe

59:26.258 --> 59:28.227
and your families accounted for.

59:29.094 --> 59:32.398
At 8 p.m., the curfew happens.

59:32.464 --> 59:37.002
And we want you either in
your home or well on your way.

59:46.245 --> 59:49.848
Everyone, now,
everyone, please, please.

59:52.851 --> 59:54.720
We all need to do our part.

59:55.854 --> 59:58.123
If you're home,
then our fine men

59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.292
and women uniform will
know you are safe.

01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:03.095
Look at all of you.

01:00:03.162 --> 01:00:04.230
Who's that motherfucker?

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:06.065
- Gathered under one roof.
- The pastor.

01:00:06.131 --> 01:00:07.566
Hmm.

01:00:07.634 --> 01:00:11.103
Coming together at
just the right time.

01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:15.507
We need each other.

01:00:18.043 --> 01:00:20.446
There are forces out there

01:00:20.512 --> 01:00:23.282
that will try and tear us apart.

01:00:26.885 --> 01:00:27.753
No.

01:00:29.288 --> 01:00:32.091
An unwavering belief in the Lord

01:00:33.225 --> 01:00:37.229
and in our police force
is what we can count on

01:00:37.296 --> 01:00:40.132
to keep us strong,

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.301
keep us united.

01:00:45.504 --> 01:00:50.109
As for the person or
persons responsible,

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:53.779
let's just pray

01:00:55.114 --> 01:01:00.185
that all lost souls find
their way back to salvation.

01:01:02.588 --> 01:01:04.356
The Nain Rouge is real!

01:01:04.423 --> 01:01:06.392
I lost my niece
to drug violence,

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:07.761
and I want the police to
do something about it!

01:01:07.826 --> 01:01:10.162
We all heard about this
little red devil on the loose.

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:13.198
Is there a monster
loose in Lake Orion?

01:01:13.265 --> 01:01:16.135
People, people,
please, please.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:18.871
We need to keep
our heads about us.

01:01:18.937 --> 01:01:21.974
There isn't anything
supernatural going on.

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:24.476
We've all heard the stories.

01:01:25.944 --> 01:01:27.880
Campfire tales, that's all.

01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:32.084
I need you to trust us,

01:01:34.219 --> 01:01:38.624
all of us, that we are
doing everything we can

01:01:38.692 --> 01:01:40.025
to get to the bottom.

01:01:41.628 --> 01:01:45.364
In fact, Officer Finnick, who
do you have there with you?

01:01:46.298 --> 01:01:48.467
Oh, my apologies, Chief,

01:01:48.534 --> 01:01:51.036
and to the great
people of Lake Orion.

01:01:51.103 --> 01:01:52.071
I'm Detective Nightingale

01:01:52.137 --> 01:01:54.039
from the Detroit
Police Department.

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:56.308
I'm here on a special
assignment to assist

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:58.110
in investigating these murders.

01:01:59.978 --> 01:02:01.380
If you'll have me!

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.151
Well, that'll be
just fine by me.

01:02:06.218 --> 01:02:09.188
And in fact, I think
that just about does it.

01:02:09.254 --> 01:02:11.924
Please be safe,
everyone, going home

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.326
and respect the curfew tonight.

01:02:14.393 --> 01:02:16.128
God bless you all.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:33.479
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:02:34.748 --> 01:02:36.548
What happened to you
at the town hall meeting?

01:02:36.615 --> 01:02:38.951
You know I'm not
a politics guy.

01:02:39.017 --> 01:02:40.953
I was looking for you, today.

01:02:41.019 --> 01:02:42.287
I took a trip outta town.

01:02:43.422 --> 01:02:45.424
If you're, uh, not on
this thing all night,

01:02:45.491 --> 01:02:47.092
or you just want
to take a break,

01:02:47.159 --> 01:02:48.360
you should stop by later.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:52.464
I, uh, think I could do that.

01:02:54.099 --> 01:02:55.100
Okay.

01:02:55.167 --> 01:02:56.001
See you then.

01:03:04.243 --> 01:03:06.044
Is that your man there?

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.547
Not yet.

01:03:09.415 --> 01:03:10.582
The night's still young.

01:03:12.719 --> 01:03:14.486
Now
what's good here?

01:03:14.553 --> 01:03:15.655
Cheeseburgers.

01:03:17.055 --> 01:03:17.923
You buying?

01:03:19.057 --> 01:03:19.925
Why not?

01:03:50.389 --> 01:03:52.324
It has been summoned.

01:04:10.677 --> 01:04:12.578
Hey, perfect
timing, come here.

01:04:15.314 --> 01:04:16.315
Set your phone down.

01:04:17.717 --> 01:04:19.485
Put these on.

01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.353
Here, push your hair back first.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.722
I don't think you
want me to touch this...

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:23.823
I got it, I got it.

01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:24.757
Thing.

01:04:26.124 --> 01:04:27.192
What is this?

01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:29.561
I'm not really sure.

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:31.530
I was hoping you
could help me out.

01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:33.565
Okay.

01:04:33.633 --> 01:04:35.400
Kind of a work in progress.

01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:43.308
Is this your first time?

01:04:43.375 --> 01:04:45.177
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:45.244 --> 01:04:47.747
Grab on to here, don't
press the red handle.

01:04:47.814 --> 01:04:49.047
Put your mask down.

01:04:50.315 --> 01:04:52.451
I'm gonna guide you, okay?

01:04:54.319 --> 01:04:55.187
Okay.

01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:58.223
And...

01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:01.560
Now go in straight.

01:05:35.895 --> 01:05:38.430
How'd I do?

01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:39.732
Not bad at all.

01:05:41.466 --> 01:05:42.334
I'm impressed.

01:06:17.502 --> 01:06:19.438
Good afternoon, Doc.

01:06:19.504 --> 01:06:21.841
I'm Detective Nightingale
from Detroit Police.

01:06:21.908 --> 01:06:22.709
Dr. Muskoviti.

01:06:22.775 --> 01:06:24.911
Pleasure to meet you, Detective.

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:26.879
What's our story here?

01:06:26.946 --> 01:06:29.181
Got a real unusual case here.

01:06:29.247 --> 01:06:31.651
He's got a combination
of real deep thermal

01:06:31.718 --> 01:06:35.855
and chemical burns, some
real unusual wounds here.

01:06:35.922 --> 01:06:37.924
Either he learns how to
shave less aggressively

01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:42.227
and not sit under the sunlamp
all day, or as he claims,

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:44.731
some red, little,
rodent-looking monster broke

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:47.566
into his house and
blew up his meth lab

01:06:47.634 --> 01:06:49.601
and left him lookin' like this.

01:07:28.775 --> 01:07:31.176
Who did this to you, Ike?

01:07:39.317 --> 01:07:40.653
Get me out of here!

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.387
Get me out of here!

01:07:43.823 --> 01:07:47.259
No, I need to get out of here!

01:07:47.325 --> 01:07:48.795
He's comin' for us all!

01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:51.563
Every single one of you
motherfuckers is gonna die!

01:07:51.631 --> 01:07:52.899
He'll cut your tongue out

01:07:52.965 --> 01:07:55.500
before you even get
a fuckin' word out!

01:07:55.567 --> 01:07:56.334
Let go of me, man!

01:07:56.401 --> 01:07:58.503
I need to get out of here!

01:07:58.570 --> 01:07:59.604
Let me go!

01:07:59.672 --> 01:08:01.540
- I got this.
- Let me go!

01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:03.208
Ike, I got this!

01:08:04.342 --> 01:08:05.210
Ah!

01:08:06.478 --> 01:08:07.479
Ah!

01:08:13.019 --> 01:08:15.888
The ice cream social is
next Sunday after services.

01:08:15.955 --> 01:08:17.288
Please stick around.

01:08:18.622 --> 01:08:23.428
I was reading a poem last
week that I found in college,

01:08:24.663 --> 01:08:26.698
and it means more to me
now than it did then,

01:08:26.765 --> 01:08:29.301
and I think it
will for you, too.

01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:34.372
From "Ulysses," by
Lord Alfred Tennyson.

01:08:36.943 --> 01:08:39.444
- Please.
- I got this.

01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:40.880
Just tell me who did it.

01:08:42.115 --> 01:08:43.247
Who was it?

01:08:44.416 --> 01:08:45.283
The devil.

01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:48.020
It was the devil.

01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:49.889
Calm down, Ike.

01:08:49.956 --> 01:08:51.791
- Please.
- Calm down.

01:08:52.825 --> 01:08:54.326
Leave the drugs alone, man.

01:08:54.392 --> 01:08:56.261
I told you that your whole life.

01:08:57.863 --> 01:08:59.564
Now get off of that shit, boy.

01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:01.934
I told you about that shit.

01:09:03.803 --> 01:09:07.006
- Please.
- No, man, let go of me, man!

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:08.975
Come on, man, it's
gonna be all right.

01:09:11.408 --> 01:09:12.678
Ike, hold on, just hold on, man.

01:09:14.513 --> 01:09:15.948
This'll be fine.

01:09:16.015 --> 01:09:16.948
I got this.

01:09:18.017 --> 01:09:19.518
I'll be right back.

01:09:19.584 --> 01:09:20.618
Just hold tight.

01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:45.877
Much abides.

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:50.850
Though we are not
now that strength,

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:56.421
which in old days,
moved earth and heaven,

01:09:56.488 --> 01:10:00.325
that which we are, we are.

01:10:01.093 --> 01:10:04.163
One equal temper
of heroic hearts

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:09.434
made weak my time and fate,

01:10:13.739 --> 01:10:14.941
but strong in will,

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:21.479
to strive, to seek,

01:10:22.782 --> 01:10:27.385
to find, and not to yield.

01:11:20.039 --> 01:11:21.807
Are you okay?

01:11:21.874 --> 01:11:23.408
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:11:25.311 --> 01:11:26.879
I gotta go.

01:11:26.946 --> 01:11:28.014
Okay.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.915
Duty calls.

01:11:30.883 --> 01:11:31.884
I'll see you soon?

01:11:32.985 --> 01:11:34.887
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.608
You are good.

01:13:50.222 --> 01:13:50.890
Great.

01:13:54.693 --> 01:13:56.629
What more do I gotta say?

01:13:57.696 --> 01:13:59.632
You don't come around
here, you hear me?

01:13:59.698 --> 01:14:02.034
This is my place as
much as it is the boy's.

01:14:02.101 --> 01:14:04.370
But that don't mean
just anyone's invited.

01:14:04.437 --> 01:14:05.805
Are you listenin' to me?

01:14:07.907 --> 01:14:09.642
In or out of uniform,

01:14:09.708 --> 01:14:13.679
you don't touch an
officer of the law, ever!

01:14:13.746 --> 01:14:15.915
You also don't get to
tell me who I can see.

01:14:17.249 --> 01:14:19.652
From now on, when we meet,

01:14:19.718 --> 01:14:22.088
you either smile, nod or wave.

01:14:22.154 --> 01:14:24.056
I don't care which.

01:14:24.123 --> 01:14:26.325
Then you go about your business.

01:14:26.392 --> 01:14:28.060
Don't say a single word.

01:14:28.127 --> 01:14:30.362
And if I ever catch you
smelling like this again

01:14:30.429 --> 01:14:32.965
in a vehicle, I'll
run your ass in.

01:14:35.935 --> 01:14:37.169
Now I loved your daughter.

01:14:38.437 --> 01:14:40.873
If I could've traded places
with her, I would have.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:42.441
And I like your son.

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:43.943
That's just the way it is.

01:14:45.144 --> 01:14:47.379
But none of that
changes anything.

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:49.014
It's best you get used to it.

01:15:33.893 --> 01:15:35.427
You deserve some credit.

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.932
It was all your idea, after all.

01:15:42.301 --> 01:15:45.037
You've spoken of Nain
Rouge for ,

01:15:47.439 --> 01:15:49.341
well, as long as I can remember.

01:15:52.444 --> 01:15:53.879
But we took action.

01:16:03.856 --> 01:16:05.724
How can I possibly explain?

01:16:08.561 --> 01:16:13.732
Trying times demand
drastic measures.

01:16:14.833 --> 01:16:17.236
You're a naive son of a bitch.

01:16:18.337 --> 01:16:19.572
It's too dangerous.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:25.077
You don't have the slightest
idea of what you're doing.

01:16:25.144 --> 01:16:30.149
The congregation, the people
of Lake Orion want this.

01:16:33.852 --> 01:16:37.223
Lasting peace and prosperity.

01:16:37.289 --> 01:16:38.157
Bullshit!

01:16:39.525 --> 01:16:41.060
We'll all burn for this.

01:16:41.126 --> 01:16:42.428
No, you're wrong.

01:16:44.863 --> 01:16:47.366
I know the word of the Lord.

01:16:49.301 --> 01:16:50.169
I've heard it.

01:16:51.904 --> 01:16:52.871
He speaks to me.

01:16:55.007 --> 01:16:57.743
Now put the gun away

01:16:59.245 --> 01:17:03.449
and just accept that this
is a blessing from God.

01:17:05.884 --> 01:17:08.287
You made a deal with
the devil, Pastor.

01:17:11.557 --> 01:17:15.527
Anna Lee, you put that
gun down, right now.

01:17:17.062 --> 01:17:18.464
Do as he says.

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.300
The people won't stand for it.

01:17:22.234 --> 01:17:23.502
Now, Anna Lee.

01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:25.070
This is your last warning.

01:17:27.139 --> 01:17:28.307
She's not gonna shoot.

01:17:31.377 --> 01:17:35.214
Our secret is safe with her.

01:17:35.281 --> 01:17:36.882
Please, Anna Lee.

01:17:40.419 --> 01:17:44.023
Let's hope God
forgives both of you.

01:18:11.651 --> 01:18:13.218
Billie, it's Romano.

01:18:15.421 --> 01:18:16.288
What?

01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:19.058
Yes, I'll be there, in a second.

01:18:28.967 --> 01:18:30.235
Dad!

01:18:30.302 --> 01:18:31.537
Dad!

01:18:31.603 --> 01:18:33.005
Oh my God.

01:18:33.072 --> 01:18:34.239
Here, sit down.

01:18:35.374 --> 01:18:36.442
Jesus Christ.

01:18:46.251 --> 01:18:48.554
Neither of you
move, all right?

01:18:50.456 --> 01:18:51.090
Come on.

01:18:51.156 --> 01:18:52.524
There's a monster.

01:18:52.591 --> 01:18:53.626
He's on his way here.

01:18:54.761 --> 01:18:57.996
And, Ellis, you're
gonna help me kill it.

01:18:59.164 --> 01:19:01.066
Help you kill what?

01:19:01.133 --> 01:19:05.170
It's like a, like a red,
some sort of a just...

01:19:06.505 --> 01:19:08.073
Listen, I don't care what
the fuck this is about!

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.342
I need to get him
to a hospital now!

01:19:10.409 --> 01:19:11.678
Dad?

01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:14.213
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad,
Dad, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:19:14.279 --> 01:19:15.981
Dad, will you talk
to me, please?

01:19:16.048 --> 01:19:17.182
- You hear me?
- Okay.

01:19:17.249 --> 01:19:18.217
We can figure this thing out,

01:19:18.283 --> 01:19:20.219
and then you're
gonna help me kill it

01:19:20.285 --> 01:19:21.420
when it gets here.

01:19:22.421 --> 01:19:24.089
And we'll get him to a hospital.

01:19:24.156 --> 01:19:25.725
We'll get him to a hospital.

01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:26.659
Do you hear me?

01:19:27.694 --> 01:19:28.695
Do you hear me?

01:19:28.762 --> 01:19:30.229
Yeah, I fuckin' hear you!

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:32.498
It doesn't matter now.

01:19:39.304 --> 01:19:41.006
Ellis, where are you going?

01:19:41.073 --> 01:19:42.675
Don't you get any bright ideas.

01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:44.476
I used up all my bright ideas!

01:19:48.547 --> 01:19:50.082
You know what this is?

01:19:51.818 --> 01:19:52.819
A knife?

01:19:52.886 --> 01:19:55.354
That monster you
were talking about,

01:19:55.421 --> 01:19:56.321
that was me!

01:19:57.222 --> 01:19:58.190
I summoned it

01:19:59.425 --> 01:20:00.526
to kill people like you.

01:20:00.592 --> 01:20:02.662
Do you know how many
people you've killed?

01:20:02.729 --> 01:20:04.563
That's not gonna
bring my mom back,

01:20:04.631 --> 01:20:07.132
my sister back, and now my dad!

01:20:07.199 --> 01:20:08.635
But it'll fuckin' kill you!

01:20:08.701 --> 01:20:09.568
Call it off, Ellis!

01:20:16.442 --> 01:20:17.710
Ellis!

01:20:17.777 --> 01:20:19.111
Freeze.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.081
Turn around.

01:20:23.148 --> 01:20:24.349
I'm gonna need the knife.

01:20:25.617 --> 01:20:27.687
Not gonna happen.

01:20:27.754 --> 01:20:29.689
It doesn't matter.

01:20:29.756 --> 01:20:31.457
This is your end.

01:20:31.523 --> 01:20:32.191
No.

01:20:34.293 --> 01:20:35.762
Shoot me if you have to.

01:21:26.646 --> 01:21:28.848
You're gonna die
here for that, Ellis.

01:21:28.915 --> 01:21:30.482
And no magic's gonna save you.

01:21:30.549 --> 01:21:31.818
Had you been really
so righteous,

01:21:31.885 --> 01:21:34.353
it would've been you out
there, stickin' his neck out,

01:21:34.419 --> 01:21:37.155
instead of hangin' this on
every member of this town.

01:21:38.323 --> 01:21:39.759
Well, we're gonna change
all that, aren't we?

01:21:52.872 --> 01:21:54.741
Get up, girl.

01:23:56.294 --> 01:23:58.530
Billie, this
motherfucker's been here.

01:25:05.998 --> 01:25:09.836
Billie Jean!

01:25:47.106 --> 01:25:48.875
No.

01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:50.342
No, help!

01:25:50.408 --> 01:25:51.376
Finnick!

01:25:51.443 --> 01:25:54.814
Finnick!

01:25:56.749 --> 01:25:58.851
You motherfucker!

01:25:58.918 --> 01:26:00.887
Get your motherfuckin'
ass out of here.

01:26:04.657 --> 01:26:07.627
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:26:22.041 --> 01:26:23.075
Drop her, man, now!

01:26:29.115 --> 01:26:30.750
Nain Rouge!

01:26:30.817 --> 01:26:32.018
Come here!

01:26:32.084 --> 01:26:32.885
Get over here.

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:39.926
Billie, no!

01:27:00.478 --> 01:27:01.881
No, you ruined it!

01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.950
Give me that.

01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:04.817
Back up!

01:27:04.884 --> 01:27:05.617
Get up!

01:27:05.685 --> 01:27:07.687
Get up.

01:27:07.753 --> 01:27:09.621
It's no good, Ellis.

01:27:15.027 --> 01:27:17.495
I was doin' good
for this town.

01:27:17.562 --> 01:27:20.032
Hey, asshole, drop it or die!

01:27:21.167 --> 01:27:23.002
LOPD ain't gonna
let you walk out

01:27:23.069 --> 01:27:26.706
of this motherfucker
with one of their own.

01:27:26.772 --> 01:27:28.440
Give it up, Ellis!

01:27:35.281 --> 01:27:38.184
On your knees,
hands on your head now!

01:27:44.924 --> 01:27:46.826
I was trying to help.

01:28:20.993 --> 01:28:22.427
How you feel?

01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:24.897
I don't know.

01:28:24.964 --> 01:28:26.832
What about your boy?

01:28:30.803 --> 01:28:33.139
We lost all the
monster evidence,

01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:37.442
burned up the museum's artifact.

01:28:38.844 --> 01:28:39.712
Dammit.

01:28:40.646 --> 01:28:42.648
I don't know.

01:28:42.715 --> 01:28:44.850
Maybe we should just
keep him a couple days,

01:28:44.917 --> 01:28:46.584
just for being an asshole.

01:28:46.652 --> 01:28:48.955
We should've blamed
all this shit on his ass.

01:28:50.122 --> 01:28:51.757
Guess it's better than nothing.

01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:59.531
Thank you.

01:28:59.597 --> 01:29:03.669
Thank you.

01:29:03.736 --> 01:29:05.603
You gonna be all
right in this town.

01:29:07.139 --> 01:29:09.041
Everybody's not made
for the long war.

01:29:11.077 --> 01:29:13.012
You'll do just fine, Finnick.

01:29:15.748 --> 01:29:17.316
Take care of yourself.

01:29:17.383 --> 01:29:18.684
You too.

01:29:25.725 --> 01:29:28.995
Fellas, could I get
a ride outta here?

01:30:25.751 --> 01:30:26.819
I'm looking for a fighter

01:30:26.886 --> 01:30:29.155
that goes by the name
of Marcellus De Vaux.

01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:30.956
You mean J.D.,
the Jersey Devil.

01:30:31.023 --> 01:30:32.590
He's right there, honey.

01:33:43.983 --> 01:33:45.884
See, old friend,

01:33:45.951 --> 01:33:48.287
I broke more soldiers
than you did.
