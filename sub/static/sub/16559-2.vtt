00:00.921 --> 00:02.583
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:02.583 --> 00:03.964
What's the deal
with your father?

00:03.964 --> 00:07.048
He is not a good person.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.759
I love you, Oliver.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.261
I think
we should break up.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.514
Any new significant others,
besides Wes' little lady?

00:13.514 --> 00:14.475
Hi.

00:15.596 --> 00:16.557
Want to go
finally meet your dad?

00:16.557 --> 00:18.189
I think I'm your son.

00:18.189 --> 00:19.190
Why would you
think that?

00:20.691 --> 00:22.483
You think it's Frank
putting them up?

00:22.483 --> 00:23.604
No.

00:23.604 --> 00:25.106
I found him.
What do you want to do?

00:25.106 --> 00:27.027
Hang up the phone!

00:29.950 --> 00:30.701
You okay?

00:30.701 --> 00:32.203
Yeah.

00:32.203 --> 00:33.364
I live here! Please!

00:33.364 --> 00:34.365
Who is it? Tell me!

00:47.378 --> 00:49.670
- You're in shock right now.
- I understand that.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.302
Unfortunately,
we do need to get

00:51.302 --> 00:53.514
as much information from you
right now as possible.

00:53.514 --> 00:55.596
Can you tell us
where you were before?

00:58.729 --> 01:00.271
Ms. Keating.

01:00.271 --> 01:01.682
The clinic.

01:01.682 --> 01:04.525
I had to pick up
some work.

01:04.525 --> 01:06.026
Did anyone else
see you there?

01:06.026 --> 01:07.688
Someone who can vouch
for your whereabouts?

01:09.069 --> 01:09.860
You're joking.

01:10.991 --> 01:12.493
My house is burning down,

01:12.493 --> 01:13.824
and you want
to make me a suspect?
Now, hold on.

01:13.824 --> 01:14.865
No one's
saying anything like that.

01:14.865 --> 01:16.867
Yeah, be a monster.
That's fine.

01:16.867 --> 01:19.700
But don't be a dumbass,
as well.
To be clear,

01:19.700 --> 01:21.582
your neighbors saw your car
in the driveway all day.

01:23.964 --> 01:26.837
You want to arrest me
for burning down my house?

01:26.837 --> 01:28.379
Then do it!

01:28.379 --> 01:29.550
Cuff me right here!

01:29.550 --> 01:30.761
Arrest me!

01:30.761 --> 01:31.922
Go on, arrest me!

01:36.387 --> 01:37.138
No!

01:38.769 --> 01:40.931
What kind of dreams
were you having?

01:40.931 --> 01:43.814
Tossing and turning all night,
talking gibberish.

01:43.814 --> 01:44.605
Annalise.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.527
Hmm?

01:46.527 --> 01:47.728
Was it a sex dream?

01:47.728 --> 01:49.730
Is that why you don't
want to tell me about it?

01:49.730 --> 01:51.362
You had another guy
up in this bed?

01:51.362 --> 01:53.364
Who says it was a guy?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.948
Oh, no, no, no.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.952
No way I'm letting you
leave me high and dry.

02:04.665 --> 02:06.707
Mm. Go shower.

02:06.707 --> 02:08.209
Or else you're gonna be late
for work.

02:33.364 --> 02:37.368
I didn't --
I didn't have a choice.

02:43.874 --> 02:44.875
He's dead.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.050
Get off me!
Get off me!

02:56.217 --> 02:57.678
Annalise.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.179
I got an idea.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.013
Get in the shower.

03:03.013 --> 03:04.805
It's big enough
for both of us.

03:08.148 --> 03:09.570
Hello?

03:09.570 --> 03:10.861
This is Annalise.

03:10.861 --> 03:13.774
Hi, this is Candice from
President Hargrove's office.

03:13.774 --> 03:15.816
She was hoping
you had time to stop by today.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.459
We just wanted
to let you know

03:28.459 --> 03:30.711
that we'd launched
a priority investigation

03:30.711 --> 03:32.463
into who posted
the fliers.

03:32.463 --> 03:35.296
We're having campus security
increase their patrols, too,

03:35.296 --> 03:37.338
as well as having them
review our active-shooter drills

03:37.338 --> 03:38.509
with all of our employees.

03:38.509 --> 03:39.760
This is all standard stuff.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.141
We're not concerned.

03:41.141 --> 03:43.013
Well, I wasn't concerned

03:43.013 --> 03:45.476
till you started telling me
how not concerned you were.

03:47.688 --> 03:50.651
We just wanted you to know
we're on it.

03:50.651 --> 03:52.853
It's probably just
some student blowing off steam.

03:52.853 --> 03:53.694
Most likely.

03:55.065 --> 03:57.027
Um, one sec.

04:01.822 --> 04:03.073
"Safe space" used to mean

04:03.073 --> 04:05.205
you could
express your feelings.

04:05.205 --> 04:06.367
Now I have to take it
literally.

04:06.367 --> 04:07.458
It's fine.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.039
It's just H.R.
covering their asses.

04:09.039 --> 04:12.333
If you only knew.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.424
How's the clinic going?

04:13.424 --> 04:15.255
Good.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.757
Thanks again
for making that work.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.008
I should be thanking you

04:18.008 --> 04:19.259
for coming up
with such a great idea.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.230
Hey!

04:31.652 --> 04:33.564
Were you meeting
with the President?

04:33.564 --> 04:35.856
How'd you know?
Well, you just
walked out of her office.

04:35.856 --> 04:36.817
Oh.

04:36.817 --> 04:38.028
Is it about the fliers?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.160
No, that's all over.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.823
You still got
that god-awful apartment?

04:42.823 --> 04:44.535
Yeah.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.957
You should move out,
come stay with me.

04:46.957 --> 04:49.169
What are you talking about?

04:49.169 --> 04:50.040
I don't know.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.582
You could save money
for a little.

04:51.582 --> 04:52.713
But it's weird.

04:52.713 --> 04:55.416
Why?
Meggy, for one.

04:55.416 --> 04:57.838
Meggy?
Yeah, my girlfriend.
I told you about her.

04:57.838 --> 05:00.300
Oh, I didn't know
that was still a thing.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.013
All right, well,
forget I said anything.

05:03.013 --> 05:04.184
Go study.

05:04.184 --> 05:05.926
No one ever
became a good lawyer

05:05.926 --> 05:07.267
hanging out in the quad.

05:21.031 --> 05:22.943
What's all this?

05:22.943 --> 05:24.405
I'm reorganizing

05:24.405 --> 05:25.996
because
your stupid clinic

05:25.996 --> 05:28.208
means Annalise can't
take real cases anymore.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.370
It's not my clinic.

05:35.165 --> 05:36.877
So, the new locks,

05:36.877 --> 05:39.129
are they to keep out
anyone in particular?

05:39.129 --> 05:40.671
Why are you here,
Laurel?

05:40.671 --> 05:41.922
I just came to say hi.

05:43.053 --> 05:45.055
Is there any news
on the Mahoney case.

05:46.887 --> 05:48.729
We don't care
about that case.

05:48.729 --> 05:51.141
But the cops
haven't arrested anyone yet.

05:51.141 --> 05:53.023
Wes could still
be a suspect.

05:53.023 --> 05:54.064
He's not.

05:54.064 --> 05:55.105
How do you know that?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.607
Because Eve is on it.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.740
She has a contact at the NYPD,
so just relax.

05:59.740 --> 06:01.532
Wes is not a suspect.

06:03.984 --> 06:06.116
Is Frank?
Laurel.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.197
You would tell me
if you'd heard from him

06:07.197 --> 06:08.288
so that at least
I'd know he's not dead.

06:09.289 --> 06:11.492
Maybe he is.
Don't say that.

06:11.492 --> 06:12.953
What are you girls
gossiping about?

06:14.204 --> 06:16.256
I just came
to say hi to Bonnie.

06:16.256 --> 06:18.208
Why does everyone think
that's so weird?

07:41.251 --> 07:42.503
Are you sure
it's not weird?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.754
I've never seen you wear a suit
to class before.

07:43.754 --> 07:44.845
That's because
I don't look as dashing as you

07:44.845 --> 07:48.759
when I wear one.

07:48.759 --> 07:52.553
Hey. Uh, what do you
think about this apartment?

07:52.553 --> 07:54.224
I never said
you had to rush to move out.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.395
Yeah,
you just dumped me.

07:55.395 --> 07:56.476
Don't say it like that.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.098
What? You didn't dump me?

07:58.098 --> 08:00.561
I just don't like
that saying.

08:00.561 --> 08:02.653
Imagine how much
you'd like being dumped then.

08:04.194 --> 08:06.026
I shouldn't be late
for my first day.

08:06.026 --> 08:08.108
Do you want to walk over there
together, or...

08:08.108 --> 08:10.110
Um...you know what?

08:10.110 --> 08:12.242
I would actually
feel more comfortable

08:12.242 --> 08:13.664
if we went separately.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.996
Oh. Okay.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.248
Uh, do you want me
to go first?

08:18.248 --> 08:20.000
I'm kidding.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.121
Come on.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.674
- What did you do?
- For real.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.255
Do not tell me
that you cheated on my boy.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.797
No, actually,
it was his decision.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.338
Apparently he's been thinking
about it all summer.

08:28.338 --> 08:30.801
You don't think there's
something else going on?

08:30.801 --> 08:32.302
Wait, you think my boy
cheated on you?

08:32.302 --> 08:33.724
Have any of you
seen these articles?

08:33.724 --> 08:35.515
They're all
about the fliers.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.807
Oh, down we go.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.018
We're ignoring that
right now.

08:38.018 --> 08:38.939
Oliver dumped Connor.

08:38.939 --> 08:39.980
Why?!

08:41.481 --> 08:43.063
Oh, my God,
you cheated on him.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.145
No.
Oh, my God,
you cheated on him.

08:45.145 --> 08:46.486
No, he thinks
that he wants some space,

08:46.486 --> 08:47.738
and clearly
I'll be changing his mind

08:47.738 --> 08:48.819
by the end of the week.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.200
Damn, the girl's cocky.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.032
Well, you'd understand
if you gave me a go at that ass.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.654
Oh, sorry.
This ass is taken.

08:53.654 --> 08:56.246
By who?
Seriously,
who is this weirdo?

08:56.246 --> 08:57.618
Hot little number
I met at the bar,

08:57.618 --> 08:58.659
but she's stacked.

08:58.659 --> 08:59.750
I'll tell you,
she's up top and bottom.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.792
Just, unh!
Okay.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.874
Am I the only one
who cares about this?
I think it's good.

09:03.874 --> 09:04.965
Journalists might be able
to figure out

09:04.965 --> 09:06.466
who's putting
the fliers up.

09:06.466 --> 09:07.968
You ever think Annalise
just put them up herself?

09:07.968 --> 09:09.259
And why
would she do that?

09:09.259 --> 09:10.470
To get attention,
to play the victim.

09:10.470 --> 09:11.932
Wow, that's ridiculous.

09:11.932 --> 09:13.133
Is it?

09:13.934 --> 09:15.265
Take a seat.

09:15.265 --> 09:17.638
Court's assigned us
a new client.

09:17.638 --> 09:19.389
Irene Crowley,

09:19.389 --> 09:21.642
convicted of murdering
her husband Rodney

09:21.642 --> 09:22.943
when she was 31 years old.

09:22.943 --> 09:25.105
The weapon -- a claw hammer.

09:25.105 --> 09:26.817
After she finished,

09:26.817 --> 09:29.690
she showered,
took the bus to work,

09:29.690 --> 09:32.242
punched in on time
for her shift at the factory.

09:32.242 --> 09:33.283
Ugh, that's terrible.

09:34.454 --> 09:35.956
Why are you here?

09:35.956 --> 09:37.037
Um...

09:38.458 --> 09:40.961
You said I should
come introduce myself.

09:43.794 --> 09:45.666
Class,
this is Mr. Hampton.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.759
I've hired him as
the clinic's technology expert.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.631
He's getting paid,
so use him as you wish.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.972
As long as it's legal.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.176
Uh, my desk
is down the hall in the --

09:56.176 --> 09:58.388
Mr. Hampton.
Okay.

09:59.850 --> 10:02.102
Today,
Irene is 63 years old.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.184
She's served
32 years in prison

10:04.184 --> 10:07.397
and has been denied parole
six times.

10:07.397 --> 10:09.029
Now, we're gonna fight like hell
to get her free.

10:09.029 --> 10:11.732
Why?

10:11.732 --> 10:14.494
Irene was physically
and sexually abused
by her husband

10:14.494 --> 10:16.446
throughout
their 10-year marriage.

10:16.446 --> 10:18.368
Now, at the time,

10:18.368 --> 10:21.331
the courts did not allow
past abuse into evidence,

10:21.331 --> 10:23.203
which left her
without a defense.

10:23.203 --> 10:24.204
Domestic-abuse victims

10:24.204 --> 10:25.455
are afforded
greater protections now,

10:25.455 --> 10:27.958
so we need to create a narrative
for the parole board

10:27.958 --> 10:30.050
that highlights
the psychological trauma

10:30.050 --> 10:32.803
that led to your...episode
with your husband.

10:32.803 --> 10:34.755
That was no episode.

10:34.755 --> 10:36.807
You're right.
Bad word choice.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.598
Call it what you want.

10:38.598 --> 10:40.260
I call it my finest hour.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.893
Each of you
will be given one minute

10:42.893 --> 10:45.355
to present a parole strategy
to Irene.

10:45.355 --> 10:47.357
The key here is to focus on

10:47.357 --> 10:49.980
the kind of childhood you had
before you met Rodney.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.571
I had
a normal childhood.

10:51.571 --> 10:52.983
Really?

10:52.983 --> 10:55.035
Your file says that
you grew up in a group home

10:55.035 --> 10:56.156
with rough conditions.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.198
Rougher than yours.
I'm sorry?

10:58.198 --> 10:59.579
Those teeth tell me
you came from money.

10:59.579 --> 11:01.541
Who's next?

11:01.541 --> 11:03.083
Now, there's several arguments

11:03.083 --> 11:04.494
that will sway
the parole board.

11:04.494 --> 11:08.839
One -- if released,
does Irene pose a danger?

11:08.839 --> 11:10.630
We'll stress
your exemplary prison record.

11:10.630 --> 11:13.003
Did you attend
any A.A. meetings, bible study?

11:13.003 --> 11:14.464
I only went
to those meetings

11:14.464 --> 11:16.466
because my cellmate
kept crapping her bunk.

11:16.466 --> 11:17.888
Number two --

11:17.888 --> 11:20.350
you have to prove that she is
remorseful for her crime.

11:20.350 --> 11:21.641
Are you sorry?

11:21.641 --> 11:23.183
Because you
declined the chance

11:23.183 --> 11:24.765
to apologize
to your husband's family.

11:24.765 --> 11:26.186
Dead husband's family.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.149
See,
you don't seem remorseful.

11:29.149 --> 11:31.111
And until
you start acting sorry,

11:31.111 --> 11:32.863
no parole board's
going to release you.

11:32.863 --> 11:34.654
Great.
So can I go now?

11:34.654 --> 11:35.776
Now, the parole board

11:35.776 --> 11:37.868
consists of
three old white men.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.239
How do I know that?

11:39.239 --> 11:41.411
Because they're always
old white men,

11:41.411 --> 11:43.323
typically from
law-enforcement backgrounds.

11:43.323 --> 11:44.664
Do you know
why you should pick me?

11:44.664 --> 11:46.286
'Cause I'm white.

11:46.286 --> 11:49.039
Just like the guys
who are deciding your fate.

11:49.039 --> 11:50.670
Do I think that's cool?
No.

11:50.670 --> 11:53.173
But I do think it's smart.

11:53.173 --> 11:55.425
Racism for the win,
right?

11:55.425 --> 11:56.927
Did I say
something funny?

11:56.927 --> 11:59.099
You remind me
of my husband.

11:59.099 --> 12:00.220
I was brilliant.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.762
I made her feel like

12:01.762 --> 12:04.304
there was no chance in hell
that she would win.
Score.

12:04.304 --> 12:05.555
One less white guy
to compete with.

12:05.555 --> 12:06.726
He doesn't want the case,
genius.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.768
He knows it's a loser.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.649
We have a winner.

12:11.111 --> 12:13.733
Irene was very clear on
who she connected with.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.906
Congratulations,
Mr. Walsh.

12:21.531 --> 12:22.953
Hey.

12:22.953 --> 12:24.284
I have somewhere to be,
Wes.

12:24.284 --> 12:25.625
Are you worried
Frank's behind the fliers?

12:25.625 --> 12:28.708
That's why you asked me
to move in.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.170
No.

12:30.170 --> 12:31.631
Then why did
you ask me that?

12:31.631 --> 12:33.043
Because I'm an idiot.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.875
Forget I brought it up.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.756
You're worried about me.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.178
You think that Frank

12:38.178 --> 12:40.550
might try to pin Mahoney's
shooting on me, or worse.

12:40.550 --> 12:42.092
God's honest?

12:42.092 --> 12:45.515
I'm lonely.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.149
That's why I asked you
to move in with me.

12:49.149 --> 12:51.271
Tired of eating alone.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.193
I don't believe you.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.107
Well, I can't make you.

12:57.107 --> 12:59.529
Actually,
I have plans tonight, so...

13:06.366 --> 13:08.458
Oh, you're early.
Not that I'm complaining.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.125
Nate.

13:16.716 --> 13:19.799
I need you
to help me find Frank.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.136
I'm worried Frank
might come back, do something.

13:28.808 --> 13:29.930
Why?

13:29.930 --> 13:31.391
I just have a feeling.

13:35.195 --> 13:36.566
You just have a feeling?

13:36.566 --> 13:38.899
You want me
to show you his file?

13:38.899 --> 13:40.490
Sam was his doctor
in prison.

13:40.490 --> 13:41.741
You never told me that.

13:41.741 --> 13:44.074
Yeah, well, I didn't think
it mattered anymore.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.075
But you think
he's dangerous?

13:46.246 --> 13:47.537
He has the potential
to be.

13:48.788 --> 13:50.120
And you've been
okay with that?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.831
Listen,
I never asked Frank

13:51.831 --> 13:53.954
to do anything violent
for me.

13:53.954 --> 13:55.715
You just had him
set me up for Sam's murder.

13:59.629 --> 14:01.341
- Who is it?
- Thai food delivery.

14:05.926 --> 14:06.967
Okay.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.018
I'll help you find him.

14:09.389 --> 14:11.311
Have you seen this?

14:11.311 --> 14:12.682
There is
an article on Annalise

14:12.682 --> 14:14.274
in almost
every single paper.

14:14.274 --> 14:15.355
Slow news day,
I guess.

14:16.526 --> 14:18.738
What?
This is a big deal.

14:18.738 --> 14:20.400
Is it?
Yes.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.741
Whoever's putting these up

14:21.741 --> 14:23.403
could be crazy
or dangerous or --

14:23.403 --> 14:25.365
Or just really bored.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.947
Just think about
what's happening here.

14:26.947 --> 14:28.408
Annalise is one of 10 women

14:28.408 --> 14:30.160
in a senior position
at Middleton,

14:30.160 --> 14:34.624
and then along comes some pissy,
probably white troll

14:34.624 --> 14:36.917
out to destroy her career.
Her career's doing fine.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.498
For now.

14:41.091 --> 14:43.053
I made dessert,

14:43.053 --> 14:44.464
and you're not even
gonna touch it?

14:44.464 --> 14:46.806
You didn't
make anything.

14:46.806 --> 14:48.348
And it's the same color

14:48.348 --> 14:49.719
as my cadaver's
esophageal sphincter.

14:51.601 --> 14:53.013
Close your eyes.

14:55.976 --> 14:57.187
Now open your mouth.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.438
Oh, my God.

14:58.438 --> 14:59.609
Trust me.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.251
Okay, here's the game plan
for Irene's case.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.503
We're going to
divide and conquer in teams.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.346
Sorry.
Seriously?

15:26.346 --> 15:27.887
Build your own burrito bar
at lunch, bro.

15:27.887 --> 15:31.101
Team one
will be Michaela and Asher.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.475
Look.

15:35.475 --> 15:38.398
You think that
I want to do this? No.

15:38.398 --> 15:40.020
But it's our job.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.191
You mean your job.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.113
All of our jobs.

15:43.113 --> 15:45.945
And yes, the chances of us
winning this are small,

15:45.945 --> 15:47.487
if not zero.

15:47.487 --> 15:49.239
You want to inspire
your team here?

15:49.239 --> 15:50.530
Don't crap on a case

15:50.530 --> 15:52.412
just because you're feeling
a little insecure.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.168
Uh, team one
will find witnesses

15:58.168 --> 16:00.290
to testify to the abuse.

16:00.290 --> 16:01.541
All the neighbors are dead.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.214
Everyone she worked with
at the factory, dead.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.925
Well,
you know who's not dead

16:05.925 --> 16:07.927
is, uh, little Asher
when he's with you.

16:07.927 --> 16:10.050
Not here.
Why?

16:10.050 --> 16:12.012
You embarrassed to be
banging a white dude?

16:12.012 --> 16:13.473
Okay.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.225
The fact that you
in your seersucker

16:15.225 --> 16:17.187
"ain't never seen a black girl
naked until me"

16:17.187 --> 16:18.308
just made this a race issue

16:18.308 --> 16:19.649
is so problematic,

16:19.649 --> 16:21.021
I don't even know
where to start.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.152
I just
don't see the point

16:22.152 --> 16:23.273
in keeping this
a secret anymore.

16:23.273 --> 16:24.564
Think of Bonnie's feelings,

16:24.564 --> 16:26.156
and -- and -- and --
and Connor.

16:26.156 --> 16:27.027
He just got dumped.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.448
We have to be
more sensitive.

16:28.448 --> 16:29.819
Well, you know who else
we have to be sensitive to?

16:30.780 --> 16:32.452
Little Asher.

16:33.573 --> 16:34.874
Help me find
a stupid witness.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.787
Our biggest hurdle
is going to be

16:37.787 --> 16:39.539
the dead husband's sister --
Amber.

16:39.539 --> 16:41.581
She's shown up
at every parole hearing

16:41.581 --> 16:43.883
to testify
against Irene's release.

16:43.883 --> 16:45.675
Laurel and Wes,
you guys seem sweet,

16:45.675 --> 16:48.128
so we'll use that
to our advantage.

16:48.128 --> 16:48.968
He was my brother.

16:48.968 --> 16:50.009
There's no way in hell

16:50.009 --> 16:51.931
I'm helping that woman
get out of jail.

16:51.931 --> 16:54.054
We're just suggesting
you talk to her.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.306
See the progress she's made
since the last parole hearing.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.557
She wants
to apologize to you.

16:57.557 --> 16:58.768
Do you think
I want that?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.231
I'm the one
who found Rodney's body.

17:01.231 --> 17:03.143
I slipped in his blood.
I fell on him.

17:04.404 --> 17:06.486
Screw forgiveness.

17:08.448 --> 17:10.450
Our most important angle,
of course,

17:10.450 --> 17:12.612
is Irene's own testimony.

17:12.612 --> 17:14.454
She's a bit of
a hard nut to crack,

17:14.454 --> 17:16.206
so, uh, Simon and Natalie,

17:16.206 --> 17:18.618
you guys are gonna
go down to the prison

17:18.618 --> 17:20.620
and talk to her --
Excuse me?

17:20.620 --> 17:22.922
Our client picked you
as first chair, Mr. Walsh.

17:22.922 --> 17:24.584
Yeah, I-I just thought
she'd feel more comfortable

17:24.584 --> 17:26.166
talking to a woman
about her abuse.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.627
Then why send me?

17:27.627 --> 17:29.169
Unless I grew a vagina
I don't know about.

17:29.169 --> 17:31.511
Why don't you check?
Go to the prison
and do your job.

17:32.842 --> 17:35.725
First they'll ask about
your life before the crime.

17:35.725 --> 17:37.727
But mostly you'll tell them

17:37.727 --> 17:39.439
about your life
with your husband --

17:39.439 --> 17:42.021
the abuse that led up
to the events of that night.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.274
I don't remember
anything from that night.

17:44.274 --> 17:45.895
Nothing?
Not a lick.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.573
I think you're lying.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.456
I think you do remember.

17:56.456 --> 17:57.867
I -- I don't blame you

17:57.867 --> 17:59.999
for not wanting
to talk about it.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.871
I wouldn't
want to either.

18:05.705 --> 18:08.168
But I read about
what he did to you.

18:08.168 --> 18:11.711
Reading about it's different
than being there.

18:11.711 --> 18:14.554
You want to know
what's worse?

18:14.554 --> 18:18.017
The feeling I get
during those hearings.

18:18.017 --> 18:20.890
Those men on the board
wanting me on my knees,

18:20.890 --> 18:26.436
spill my deepest and darkest,
beg,

18:26.436 --> 18:28.278
only to tell me no again.

18:35.735 --> 18:37.697
I'd rather get hit.

18:40.910 --> 18:42.242
Sam's sister.

18:42.242 --> 18:44.123
She was such a bitch.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.915
Hannah Keating.
What about Nate?

18:45.915 --> 18:48.087
He could be
playing a long con.

18:48.087 --> 18:50.510
Mm. Put him down.
Know what makes me sad?

18:50.510 --> 18:52.302
What are you guys doing?

18:52.302 --> 18:54.093
It's, uh,
A.K.'s enemies list.

18:54.093 --> 18:56.055
One of these peeps
has got to be behind the fliers.

18:56.055 --> 18:57.717
You realize the woman's
gonna rot in prison

18:57.717 --> 18:58.968
if you don't help me,
right?

19:01.561 --> 19:02.762
We forgot about Meggy.

19:02.762 --> 19:04.023
Oh.
Yes.

19:04.023 --> 19:05.064
No.

19:05.064 --> 19:06.316
You said you met her
at a bookstore.

19:06.316 --> 19:07.647
Don't you think that's
a little bit suspicious?

19:07.647 --> 19:08.938
How is that suspicious?

19:10.069 --> 19:11.771
We should have Oliver
hack her.
No.

19:11.771 --> 19:13.403
I need him
to work on my case.

19:13.403 --> 19:14.734
Your case is a dud.
Deal with it.

19:14.734 --> 19:15.535
Oliver.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.578
I know you're bored.

19:18.578 --> 19:19.909
You make that very clear

19:19.909 --> 19:22.662
with how loud you're stomping
around with those boxes.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.284
This isn't about that.

19:24.284 --> 19:25.495
It's Laurel.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.587
She wasn't just here
to say hi?

19:27.587 --> 19:28.998
No.

19:28.998 --> 19:30.880
She was asking me
if I heard from him,

19:30.880 --> 19:32.882
so I paid to get her phone logs,
and look.

19:34.254 --> 19:35.635
She's been calling Frank.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.931
I hate them.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.434
Every single one of
their bitch-ass lying faces.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.435
Let me take care of it.

19:46.856 --> 19:47.647
How?

19:48.858 --> 19:50.440
Don't worry.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.481
I'll figure it out.

19:55.074 --> 19:56.816
Ms. Crowley,
can you tell us a bit

19:56.816 --> 19:59.158
about your relationship
with your husband.

19:59.158 --> 20:00.990
Let's start with
how you met.

20:00.990 --> 20:02.532
Picked me up in a bar.

20:02.532 --> 20:03.703
I got knocked up.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.915
A few weeks later,
we got married.

20:05.915 --> 20:07.247
Can I ask what happened
with the child?

20:07.247 --> 20:09.208
It was a girl.
She died inside of me.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.041
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:12.041 --> 20:15.595
It's not your fault.

20:15.595 --> 20:18.097
Ms. Crowley, I'd like to discuss
the alleged abuse.

20:18.097 --> 20:20.640
Uh, I'm sorry, can we just
back up for a second.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.552
Uh, the reason
you lost the child,

20:22.552 --> 20:24.264
this was due to the abuse,
yes?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.555
I never said that.

20:25.555 --> 20:27.977
No, but, uh,
hospital records show

20:27.977 --> 20:29.769
that you had a broken wrist
at the time

20:29.769 --> 20:30.980
that you were admitted
for the miscarriage, so --

20:30.980 --> 20:31.851
Ms. Keating.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.655
This is her time.
Don't speak for her.

20:35.655 --> 20:38.027
My apologies.

20:38.027 --> 20:40.159
I've read all your files,
Ms. Crowley,

20:40.159 --> 20:42.862
and the problem I'm having is
during your trial,

20:42.862 --> 20:44.954
you never officially stated
that your husband abused you.

20:44.954 --> 20:47.076
Is that true?

20:47.076 --> 20:49.168
It's in the file,
I guess, so...

20:49.168 --> 20:50.580
She never said anything

20:50.580 --> 20:52.171
because her lawyer
advised her not to.
Quiet.

20:52.171 --> 20:53.423
I'm asking
because it strikes me

20:53.423 --> 20:54.834
as a convenient
parole strategy

20:54.834 --> 20:56.296
to invent claims of abuse

20:56.296 --> 20:58.217
now that the laws have changed
in favor of the victim.

20:58.217 --> 21:00.219
It wasn't my strategy.

21:00.219 --> 21:03.182
So, are we or are we not
to believe you were abused?

21:03.182 --> 21:05.845
You're gonna believe
whatever you want

21:05.845 --> 21:07.226
no matter what I say.

21:07.226 --> 21:09.309
If you look in file C-11,

21:09.309 --> 21:12.021
there are photos taken after
one of Mr. Crowley's attacks

21:12.021 --> 21:14.273
that are evidence
of the abuse.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.525
Fine. Let's say
you were indeed abused.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.777
The police report states

21:17.777 --> 21:19.449
that there was
no imminent threat

21:19.449 --> 21:21.361
at the time of the murder,
so my question is,

21:21.361 --> 21:23.573
if your husband
was abusing you so badly,

21:23.573 --> 21:25.955
why did you kill him
instead of just leaving him?

21:25.955 --> 21:27.907
That is
the wrong question.
Quick recess.

21:27.907 --> 21:29.579
You're asking my client
what's wrong with her

21:29.579 --> 21:31.911
when you should be asking
what was wrong with the man

21:31.911 --> 21:33.793
that repeatedly battered --
Connor, enough.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.545
Instead, you're putting
the burden on the victim!

21:35.545 --> 21:37.717
Young man,
you need to rein it in.

21:37.717 --> 21:39.919
My client has suffered
a lifetime of horror,

21:39.919 --> 21:41.971
and you're just continuing
the cycle of abuse,

21:41.971 --> 21:43.012
and I won't allow it!

21:43.012 --> 21:44.764
Now,
she's been bullied enough,

21:44.764 --> 21:47.056
and I think we need
to finally listen to her.

21:51.691 --> 21:53.022
I blew it.
Calm down.

21:53.022 --> 21:54.193
I can admit to ineffective
assistance of counsel.

21:54.193 --> 21:55.314
That is not what happened.
It's not her fault

21:55.314 --> 21:56.986
that I can't
keep my mouth shut.

21:56.986 --> 21:59.779
I should be punished for that,
not her.
Relax, okay? Breathe.

21:59.779 --> 22:01.361
That was just the first session.
We can still fix this.

22:01.361 --> 22:02.362
If I have to go
back in there,

22:02.362 --> 22:04.033
I'm just gonna
screw it up.

22:04.033 --> 22:05.825
You should fire me.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.867
Well, Irene is the only one
who could fire you,

22:07.867 --> 22:09.208
and she hasn't
done that yet.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.830
You're her counsel now,

22:10.830 --> 22:12.752
and for once in her life,

22:12.752 --> 22:15.585
the only man that's
not gonna disappoint her.

22:16.876 --> 22:18.127
I'll be right back.

22:18.127 --> 22:20.720
Wait, you have
to help me prepare.

22:20.720 --> 22:22.962
I'm just stepping outside.
Call the others.

22:32.522 --> 22:34.564
Oh, ignore it.

22:34.564 --> 22:36.025
Like you have to tell me.

22:37.276 --> 22:40.480
You know, I don't --
I don't think they'd be mad.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.821
Who?
Connor.

22:41.821 --> 22:43.242
I-I-I think
he'd be happy for us.

22:43.242 --> 22:44.694
And -- And I could
talk to Bonnie.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.486
Uh, you know, hiding is what
messed her and me up

22:46.486 --> 22:47.867
to begin with, so...

22:47.867 --> 22:49.078
For the record,

22:49.078 --> 22:52.161
you are forcing me
to say these things.

22:52.161 --> 22:53.703
What things?
We're not a couple.

22:53.703 --> 22:55.164
We're never gonna be
a couple.

22:55.164 --> 22:56.916
Why not?

22:56.916 --> 22:58.918
I can't be in a relationship
with somebody

22:58.918 --> 23:01.380
who is literally the opposite
of everything I stand for.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.633
I'm a cooler guy
than I used to be.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.465
You...
you have to admit that.

23:05.465 --> 23:06.556
I-I-I'm learning --

23:06.556 --> 23:08.097
And I am not your teacher.

23:08.097 --> 23:09.429
I don't have time

23:09.429 --> 23:11.010
to strip you of all
your terrible white habits,

23:11.010 --> 23:12.181
so either accept the fact

23:12.181 --> 23:13.853
that you are just
a meat stick to me,

23:13.853 --> 23:14.814
or we can end this.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.608
Fine, I'll go.

23:18.608 --> 23:20.189
No, no, no, no, no.

23:22.071 --> 23:24.073
How about I give you
another double?

23:24.073 --> 23:26.486
♪ I gotta let you go ♪

23:28.117 --> 23:29.408
Wichita?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.870
As in Kansas?

23:30.870 --> 23:32.952
He's been checking his voicemail
on a computer.

23:32.952 --> 23:34.454
The I.P. address
is in Wichita.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.414
And that was today?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.126
An hour ago.

23:37.126 --> 23:38.167
I'll keep track

23:38.167 --> 23:39.879
and make sure
he doesn't drive back here.

23:39.879 --> 23:41.801
Thank you.

23:41.801 --> 23:43.042
All right,
I need to get back.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.715
You're done with me?

23:45.715 --> 23:48.137
I have a client
that needs me.

23:48.137 --> 23:49.849
What about my needs?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.363
What are you doing?

24:04.363 --> 24:06.275
I saw it, Laurel.

24:06.275 --> 24:09.238
I was just checking to see
if they had a suspect yet.

24:09.238 --> 24:11.831
Why?
Because I don't want it
to be you.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.123
I'm sorry, okay?

24:14.123 --> 24:15.334
What if Eve is wrong,

24:15.334 --> 24:16.996
and the cops
know who you are.

24:16.996 --> 24:18.838
What does Eve
have to do with it?

24:18.838 --> 24:20.920
She's watching the case
for Annalise.

24:24.924 --> 24:26.385
We're not
doing this anymore.

24:26.385 --> 24:28.638
Creating problems
where there are none.

24:28.638 --> 24:31.801
What if there are
problems?
I'm happy, Laurel.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.895
Trying to be.

24:35.895 --> 24:37.767
It's because I moved on,

24:37.767 --> 24:41.310
so please just...let me.

24:41.310 --> 24:44.153
I'm sorry.

24:44.153 --> 24:46.025
About Meggy, too.

24:46.025 --> 24:48.197
Oliver did a whole search on her
and she's a Girl Scout.

24:48.197 --> 24:51.490
Worst thing she's ever done
is protest a marine park.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.612
I knew that.

24:52.612 --> 24:54.574
You looked into her?

24:54.574 --> 24:56.746
I'm not an idiot.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.209
Here's what you need to say.

25:00.209 --> 25:02.081
He was about to hit you.

25:02.081 --> 25:04.123
He wasn't.
I know.
Look, I'm just --

25:04.123 --> 25:05.835
I'm trying to help,
all right?
You're doing a bad job.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.426
Listen to me!

25:07.426 --> 25:08.678
For once, just...

25:11.681 --> 25:13.472
Just -- just listen,
all right?

25:13.472 --> 25:16.185
They need to hear it
straight from you --

25:16.185 --> 25:19.849
some explanation of why you
killed him in that moment.

25:19.849 --> 25:22.982
It doesn't matter
how ugly you think it is

25:22.982 --> 25:25.855
or how bad you think
it makes you look.

25:25.855 --> 25:28.738
Your only chance
of getting out is you talk.

25:43.422 --> 25:44.754
I did what you did.

25:46.215 --> 25:48.337
Killed a guy.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.303
And I didn't have
as good of an excuse as you,

25:54.303 --> 25:55.765
but I did it.

25:55.765 --> 25:57.767
And I got away with it.

25:57.767 --> 26:00.439
I've --
I've never told anyone.

26:00.439 --> 26:04.393
Well, it's -- it's messed
a lot of stuff up for me.

26:04.393 --> 26:07.356
People around you can sense
that you're hiding something,

26:07.356 --> 26:08.898
and it pushes them away.

26:08.898 --> 26:10.189
That's what's happening
in that room.

26:10.189 --> 26:12.692
You know,
every guy on that board

26:12.692 --> 26:16.245
can -- can see that
you're not telling the truth,

26:16.245 --> 26:18.367
and it makes them
not trust you.

26:18.367 --> 26:19.999
But you can't afford that.

26:19.999 --> 26:21.791
You need them on your side,

26:21.791 --> 26:24.463
and the only way that happens
is you finally talk.

26:33.012 --> 26:34.924
What'd you say to her?

26:34.924 --> 26:36.846
I just gave her
a pep talk.

26:36.846 --> 26:40.269
No, you opened
your fat mouth.

26:40.269 --> 26:42.722
I suffer every day
to keep you people safe.

26:42.722 --> 26:44.143
My career, reputation,

26:44.143 --> 26:46.275
it's all on the line
because of you.

26:46.275 --> 26:47.606
So no more
screwing with my life

26:47.606 --> 26:48.898
just because you feel like it,
understood?

26:53.232 --> 26:54.734
Let's hope to God
this works.

26:57.576 --> 27:00.119
You hear if Connor
finally lost his case?
I don't know.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.541
It's not like anyone
ever tells the meat stick
anything anyways.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.744
I knew you were gonna be
a baby about this.

27:04.744 --> 27:07.206
Stacy and Nicole said that
you were the one being a baby.

27:07.206 --> 27:08.507
Oh, my God.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.129
You talked about me
to those freshmen?

27:10.129 --> 27:11.841
They're my girls, okay?

27:11.841 --> 27:13.212
And I think that your whole, uh,
"we're too different" crap

27:13.212 --> 27:14.593
is actually a cover
for the fact

27:14.593 --> 27:16.055
that you know
that we're the same.

27:16.055 --> 27:18.217
How are we the same?
Uh, a lot of ways.

27:18.217 --> 27:20.059
For example, you like
having sex with me,

27:20.059 --> 27:21.470
and so do I.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.102
You're ridiculous.
I know you, Michaela.

27:23.102 --> 27:24.183
The real you, okay?

27:24.183 --> 27:25.354
I know you came here

27:25.354 --> 27:27.476
to be Michelle
or Hillary or RBG,

27:27.476 --> 27:29.398
and I came here to be my dad,
right?

27:29.398 --> 27:30.439
The better version.

27:30.439 --> 27:31.570
You know what?

27:31.570 --> 27:33.823
We met Annalise
and we did bad things,

27:33.823 --> 27:36.946
and now we're different,
which makes us the same.

27:36.946 --> 27:38.157
But you can't see that

27:38.157 --> 27:39.618
because you're holding on
to this old idea

27:39.618 --> 27:43.622
of who you used to be
and who I was, and...

27:47.917 --> 27:49.248
I'm more than a meat stick.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.924
Ms. Crowley,
take us through the weeks

27:54.924 --> 27:57.096
leading up to the day
of your husband's murder.

28:02.802 --> 28:04.103
Ms. Crowley.

28:09.809 --> 28:11.610
Okay, let's move on
to your time in prison --

28:11.610 --> 28:14.573
We had no doors
in the house.

28:14.573 --> 28:18.778
No one ever asked me
why Rodney did that.

28:18.778 --> 28:22.451
Took doors off hinges

28:22.451 --> 28:24.283
so I wouldn't
be able to hide.

28:25.664 --> 28:28.417
Came in once
while I was peeing,

28:28.417 --> 28:30.920
yelling, grabbed my neck,
stuck my head in the toilet.

28:32.291 --> 28:35.885
I almost drowned
in my own urine.

28:35.885 --> 28:39.098
Another time,
he raped me with a hose,

28:39.098 --> 28:41.140
a mop handle.

28:41.140 --> 28:43.933
You want stories
like that?

28:43.933 --> 28:45.304
I got them.

28:48.307 --> 28:50.689
Now, I can see

28:50.689 --> 28:52.611
that you want to know
what I did with the hammer.

28:56.565 --> 28:58.487
I planned it.
You were right about that.

28:58.487 --> 29:02.621
Not 'cause he was gonna
beat me that day.

29:02.621 --> 29:07.706
Because he was gonna beat me
for the rest of my life.

29:07.706 --> 29:11.460
And looking ahead to that,

29:11.460 --> 29:16.926
feeling broken bones
before they even happen...

29:16.926 --> 29:19.298
I made a decision.

29:19.298 --> 29:21.931
I sat with that hammer
for hours,

29:21.931 --> 29:23.552
and when he came home,
I stood up,

29:23.552 --> 29:27.016
and I hit him
over and over again

29:27.016 --> 29:30.940
until I saw brains.

29:30.940 --> 29:34.603
And still I didn't feel...

29:34.603 --> 29:37.026
that that made up for
all the times that he hit me.

29:39.989 --> 29:41.450
So I hit him some more.

29:46.785 --> 29:51.250
You want me
to say I'm sorry,

29:51.250 --> 29:56.255
that I regret my actions.

29:56.255 --> 29:57.376
But I don't.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.882
How can I
when it's the one decision

30:02.882 --> 30:04.303
that finally set me free?

30:11.981 --> 30:13.933
So, you could win?

30:13.933 --> 30:15.394
No, I-I didn't --
I didn't say that.

30:15.394 --> 30:17.276
Yeah, but --
well, you got her to talk,

30:17.276 --> 30:19.028
which is a victory
in itself.

30:19.028 --> 30:20.860
Yeah, but it's --
it's complicated,

30:20.860 --> 30:22.281
and...I don't know.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.243
Annalise is kind of
pissed at me, so...

30:24.243 --> 30:25.995
Yeah, well,
she's always pissed at you,

30:25.995 --> 30:27.406
and am I not
supposed to be

30:27.406 --> 30:29.038
trying to make
you feel better here?

30:29.038 --> 30:32.831
I'll feel better
if Irene gets out.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.916
I just need you
to distract me right now.
Okay.

30:36.916 --> 30:39.218
Did I -- did I ever tell you
about the time

30:39.218 --> 30:41.050
my mom caught me
wearing her lingerie?

30:53.732 --> 30:55.064
Irene stays in jail

30:55.064 --> 30:56.855
if you say what I think
you're gonna say in there.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.736
Shouldn't she?

30:59.398 --> 31:01.400
Rodney raised you, right?

31:01.400 --> 31:03.943
I read that in the reports.

31:03.943 --> 31:06.155
I think that meant
he abused you, too.

31:09.198 --> 31:11.160
If I'm wrong,
look me in my eye and say that.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.544
He wasn't a good man.

31:15.544 --> 31:17.496
No one is claiming that.

31:17.496 --> 31:19.878
But he also didn't deserve
to die that way.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.961
It must've
crossed your mind, though,

31:21.961 --> 31:23.502
when he was hitting you.

31:23.502 --> 31:25.714
And yet I never took a hammer
to his skull.

31:25.714 --> 31:28.217
Because
you didn't have to.

31:28.217 --> 31:29.558
You got out.

31:29.558 --> 31:32.061
And then
Irene took your place.

31:34.513 --> 31:36.895
No, I can't do it.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.608
I can't go in there
and say nice things about her.

31:39.608 --> 31:40.940
I know.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.691
But that's not
what I'm asking you to do.

31:54.243 --> 31:56.085
Is something wrong?

31:56.085 --> 31:57.997
We'll know soon enough.

32:13.392 --> 32:16.515
Well, it seems
the victim's witness

32:16.515 --> 32:19.558
has decided to forego
making a statement here today.

32:19.558 --> 32:22.611
This board therefore
needs no further deliberation.

32:22.611 --> 32:25.484
We came to this decision after
weighing statutory factors,

32:25.484 --> 32:26.865
the altered laws,

32:26.865 --> 32:29.738
and studies about the impact
of domestic abuse.

32:29.738 --> 32:32.491
Your candor, Ms. Crowley,

32:32.491 --> 32:34.453
was another main factor
in our decision.

32:37.706 --> 32:40.579
Ms. Crowley...

32:40.579 --> 32:42.881
we've decided to grant
your application for parole.

32:42.881 --> 32:45.884
We order
for your immediate release.

32:48.757 --> 32:49.798
Oh.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.142
Yeah, it's real.

32:53.142 --> 32:55.014
You're getting out.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.976
You won.
Oh.

32:57.976 --> 32:58.977
Thank you.

33:09.068 --> 33:10.369
Oh.

33:25.884 --> 33:27.126
It was our hope

33:27.126 --> 33:29.428
that this stunt
would burn out on its own,

33:29.428 --> 33:31.630
but it seems to be
metastasizing.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.343
All the city papers
have picked up the story,

33:34.343 --> 33:36.345
and the President
has started to receive calls

33:36.345 --> 33:37.686
from several alumni
and donors.

33:37.686 --> 33:39.978
The situation's become
a university problem.

33:39.978 --> 33:42.231
So, with everybody's
best interests in mind,

33:42.231 --> 33:43.982
we are notifying you
that you are suspended,

33:43.982 --> 33:45.694
effective immediately.

33:45.694 --> 33:48.067
At least until the board
determines that your safety,

33:48.067 --> 33:49.488
the safety of our students,

33:49.488 --> 33:50.819
and the integrity
of the university

33:50.819 --> 33:52.451
is no longer
compromised.

33:52.451 --> 33:54.913
I'm sorry that
we need to take this step

33:54.913 --> 33:56.325
right now, Annalise.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.207
But we hope
it's temporary.

34:00.419 --> 34:01.580
No.

34:03.872 --> 34:06.165
Last time I checked,
I was the victim here.

34:06.165 --> 34:08.627
An anonymous,
potentially dangerous individual

34:08.627 --> 34:11.260
chose to launch a smear campaign
at my workplace,

34:11.260 --> 34:14.012
and your solution is
to suspend me?

34:14.012 --> 34:15.634
No.

34:15.634 --> 34:18.227
Professor,
we are contractually
within our rights.

34:18.227 --> 34:19.598
You're worried
about bad press?

34:19.598 --> 34:20.939
Try the headline

34:20.939 --> 34:23.642
"Prominent Attorney
Persecuted by Elite University,"

34:23.642 --> 34:24.983
not to mention
a multi-million-dollar lawsuit

34:24.983 --> 34:26.315
I'll file.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.487
I bet you'll get calls
from the donors then.

34:28.487 --> 34:30.489
Annalise, please.

34:30.489 --> 34:32.991
No one here wants
to escalate the situation.

34:32.991 --> 34:36.034
Lock me
out of my classroom!

34:36.034 --> 34:38.657
I dare you.

34:38.657 --> 34:41.160
But you can't keep me
from teaching my students.

34:56.885 --> 34:57.716
There he is.

34:57.716 --> 34:58.767
Young lawyer home

34:58.767 --> 35:01.640
after winning
his very first case.

35:01.640 --> 35:02.311
Not a big deal.

35:02.311 --> 35:04.183
Oh, you can pretend
like you don't care,

35:04.183 --> 35:05.434
but I can tell you care.

35:06.024 --> 35:07.276
Come on, grab a bottle of
champagne in the fridge.

35:07.276 --> 35:08.317
We'll celebrate.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.693
What...what's wrong?

35:28.006 --> 35:31.250
Are you mad?

35:31.250 --> 35:32.801
No, I'm just confused.

35:33.592 --> 35:38.387
I love you, Oli.

35:38.387 --> 35:42.391
And I need you right now
more than you know.

35:42.391 --> 35:47.396
So...whatever you want,
I'll -- I'll do it.

35:47.396 --> 35:51.480
I just want to make you happy
like you make me happy,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.982
and I know that I can.

35:53.982 --> 35:56.114
So, please, just let me.

35:59.077 --> 36:00.489
I'm sorry.

36:04.583 --> 36:05.664
Oli, I...

36:07.706 --> 36:10.209
I just need to be alone
right now.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.423
What about what I need.

36:14.423 --> 36:17.296
That's the point.

36:17.296 --> 36:22.060
I only ever do
what other people want.

36:22.060 --> 36:26.104
This time,
I'm doing this for me.

36:26.104 --> 36:27.726
So, if...

36:29.107 --> 36:31.189
if you really
want to make me happy,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.981
then you'll let me go.

36:32.981 --> 36:34.363
Okay?

36:37.616 --> 36:40.409
Just...

36:40.409 --> 36:42.030
Let me go.

36:46.285 --> 36:47.496
Uh...

36:49.748 --> 36:51.630
I'll -- I'll pack.

36:51.630 --> 36:53.292
Connor.
No, no.

36:53.292 --> 36:55.384
It's your apartment,
so...

37:04.182 --> 37:05.434
I win.

37:05.434 --> 37:06.475
Again.

37:08.106 --> 37:10.148
- Drink.
- I can't.

37:10.148 --> 37:11.400
I said drink.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.443
Okay.

37:14.443 --> 37:15.904
I'm surprised
Frank didn't teach you better.

37:15.904 --> 37:17.986
We never really
played pool.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.358
'Cause you were too busy
boning all the time?

37:19.358 --> 37:21.159
No.

37:21.159 --> 37:22.781
Well...

37:22.781 --> 37:25.324
I have a question.

37:25.324 --> 37:26.365
Did you two ever hook up?

37:31.330 --> 37:32.250
No.

37:33.372 --> 37:35.584
Would you be jealous
if we did?

37:35.584 --> 37:36.755
No.

37:38.677 --> 37:41.550
What if I told you I was
talking to him every day?

37:43.642 --> 37:44.683
Are you?

37:45.514 --> 37:47.055
Are you?

37:49.978 --> 37:51.600
I've been leaving him
voicemails.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.562
He doesn't answer,
but his mailbox isn't full,

37:53.562 --> 37:55.524
so I assume
he's listening to them.

37:55.524 --> 37:59.988
You have to stop
calling him.

37:59.988 --> 38:01.900
Because
if Annalise knew --

38:01.900 --> 38:03.201
She'd kill me.
I know.

38:04.823 --> 38:05.994
You know,
I was never really sure

38:05.994 --> 38:08.036
if I actually loved him.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.869
But now that he's gone...

38:12.000 --> 38:13.041
...I did.

38:16.915 --> 38:19.468
You only think that
because you don't know him.

38:19.468 --> 38:20.629
I know about Lila.

38:22.341 --> 38:25.344
There are worse things
than murder, Laurel.

38:25.344 --> 38:29.097
You don't know that,
and that's a good thing.

38:29.097 --> 38:32.481
But I know that
and Frank knows that.

38:32.481 --> 38:37.065
We've seen things
you don't want to see.

38:37.065 --> 38:40.529
So stop calling him,
stop thinking about him,

38:40.529 --> 38:43.111
And kill the fantasy of Frank
in your head.

38:47.406 --> 38:49.368
I don't understand.
You lost him?

38:49.368 --> 38:51.209
The I.P. address in Wichita
was fake.

38:51.209 --> 38:52.501
He's using a private network

38:52.501 --> 38:53.872
to bounce the signal
all over the country.

38:53.872 --> 38:56.124
Jersey, California, Kansas.

38:56.124 --> 38:57.756
So, he could be anywhere.

38:57.756 --> 38:59.337
Philly.
Yeah.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.174
I'm gonna stay at your house
till we find him.

39:06.174 --> 39:08.887
I don't need a bodyguard.
You got one now.

39:08.887 --> 39:10.268
I'll be over
after my shift.

39:12.391 --> 39:13.642
Okay.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.653
♪ The dawn ahead
on the floor ♪

39:24.653 --> 39:26.114
What's wrong?

39:31.410 --> 39:36.374

39:39.418 --> 39:40.759

40:08.737 --> 40:09.908

Okay.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.159
I'm just telling you

40:11.159 --> 40:12.160
so you don't
have to worry about me.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.662
I don't.

40:16.244 --> 40:17.586
Heard you're having
Eve keep tabs on

40:17.586 --> 40:19.127
the Mahoney investigation,
though.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.499
Did Bonnie
tell you that?

40:20.499 --> 40:22.250
Laurel.

40:22.250 --> 40:23.301
Don't be mad at her.

40:23.301 --> 40:26.304
She just worries about me.

40:26.304 --> 40:27.966
Just like you.

40:30.509 --> 40:31.470
Do you trust her?

40:31.470 --> 40:33.101
Completely.

40:35.814 --> 40:37.606
She's my best friend.

40:37.606 --> 40:38.817
I didn't think I needed one.

40:38.817 --> 40:40.058
I did.

40:40.058 --> 40:41.770
Can't tell you
how many times

40:41.770 --> 40:43.982
she just showed up
on my doorstep to say hi...

40:48.156 --> 40:52.280
Frank,
please just come home.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.332
I spoke
to Bonnie and Annalise,

40:54.332 --> 40:55.874
and they want you back,
too.

40:55.874 --> 40:57.455
They're not mad.
No one's mad.

40:57.455 --> 41:01.339
So please come back to us.

41:01.339 --> 41:03.291
I love you.

41:05.884 --> 41:07.636
Was that okay?

41:10.509 --> 41:11.760
Perfect.

41:11.760 --> 41:13.512
Now you just got to go
see your father.

41:23.772 --> 41:24.733
Arrest me!

41:24.733 --> 41:26.024
No!

41:30.278 --> 41:33.111
If there are any other
possible scenarios...

41:33.111 --> 41:34.823
Annalise!

41:34.823 --> 41:37.826
Annalise!

41:37.826 --> 41:39.167
Let him through.

41:40.709 --> 41:42.210
I heard someone say
there's a body.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.382
Is it true?
No one
knows anything yet.

41:44.382 --> 41:46.585
Okay,
but what if it's true?
Stop it.

41:46.585 --> 41:47.836
Let's not let our minds
go there.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.761
Wipe it clean.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.973
Everything on it.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.557
Ms. Keating,
we're gonna have to
do this right now.

42:00.769 --> 42:02.901
Annalise Keating,
you're under arrest.

42:02.901 --> 42:04.142
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:04.142 --> 42:05.403
Anything you say
can and will be

42:05.403 --> 42:07.145
used against you
in a court of law.

42:07.145 --> 42:09.197
You understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

42:09.197 --> 42:10.448
Yes.
