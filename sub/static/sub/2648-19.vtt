WEBVTT

00:05.789 --> 00:07.248
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

00:07.331 --> 00:08.909
I never do this with celebrities...

00:09.000 --> 00:12.997
but are you by any chance the foxy mom
in the new Horizon Realty ad?

00:13.087 --> 00:16.372
- Am I gonna regret doing that?
- Did the Marlboro Man have any regrets?

00:17.467 --> 00:19.092
This ad is perfect.

00:19.177 --> 00:21.299
See, I'm not just selling houses,
I'm selling myself...

00:21.387 --> 00:23.760
and the best part about me is my family.

00:23.848 --> 00:25.473
And my teeth.

00:25.557 --> 00:30.267
- And both are on display in this ad.
- Mmm.

00:30.355 --> 00:32.680
"I can't be satisfied
until you're satisfied"?

00:32.774 --> 00:34.683
Coming soon to a bus bench near you.

00:34.776 --> 00:38.144
- Not to mention our minivan.
- So that's really happening?

00:38.237 --> 00:39.780
Wait, what's happening to our minivan?

00:39.863 --> 00:41.939
Having this bad boy shrink-wrapped on it.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.491
- Classy.
- Yep.

00:43.575 --> 00:45.983
Now all that driving around
your mom does will serve a purpose.

00:46.077 --> 00:47.702
Good morning, family.

00:47.787 --> 00:50.954
- How are you all doing on this beautiful day?
- Okay, what's this?

00:51.042 --> 00:53.745
- Haley's S.A.T. Scores are available online.
- I hate you.

00:53.836 --> 00:57.537
- Oh. Today's the big day.
- Let's take a look, see how she did.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.838
Do we really have to look at them now?

00:59.924 --> 01:01.882
Don't worry.
We're not expecting any miracles.

01:01.969 --> 01:02.999
Thank you.

01:03.094 --> 01:05.336
Are those Haley's scores? Are you sure?

01:05.431 --> 01:06.925
Are they bad?

01:07.014 --> 01:08.807
- No. They're not bad.
- Are they good?

01:08.891 --> 01:11.347
No, they're average.

01:11.437 --> 01:14.188
Sweetie, we did it. Our baby is average.

01:14.273 --> 01:16.229
- Medium five.
- Oh.

01:16.315 --> 01:18.605
This is just a fluke.
She can take them again.

01:18.693 --> 01:20.103
Yeah, and she'll probably do even better.

01:20.194 --> 01:21.938
You are gonna have your choice...

01:22.030 --> 01:24.069
of some pretty good colleges
when the time comes.

01:24.156 --> 01:26.648
- If I go to college.
- What?

01:26.742 --> 01:31.405
I've been thinking about it lately,
and I might not.

01:31.498 --> 01:32.907
Later.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.500
Well, we took the scenic route,
but we ended up in the same place.

01:40.255 --> 01:42.130
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

01:42.217 --> 01:44.209

01:44.302 --> 01:46.341

01:46.429 --> 01:48.303

01:48.389 --> 01:49.551

01:58.023 --> 02:00.312
Cam recently became
Franklin Middle School's...

02:00.400 --> 02:01.860
interim musical director.

02:01.944 --> 02:04.101
Go, Franklin!

02:04.196 --> 02:06.686
I was volunteering
for their spring musical festival...

02:06.782 --> 02:10.695
when their regular director
suddenly and mysteriously became ill.

02:10.785 --> 02:12.529
Oh, sorry.

02:12.620 --> 02:16.036
It may have been a blessing.
Their show lacked focus.

02:16.124 --> 02:20.074
I gave it a theme...
a musical trip around the world.

02:20.169 --> 02:24.036
Yeah, see, he focused it
by making it about the world.

02:24.132 --> 02:26.802
- You don't like it.
- No, Cam, I do.

02:26.884 --> 02:30.383
It's... Do you think that the kids are
gonna be able to learn it by tonight?

02:30.471 --> 02:32.463
Maybe you should stick with
something they already know.

02:32.556 --> 02:35.558
I knew this would happen! Why do you have
to throw a wet blanket on my dreams?

02:35.643 --> 02:37.351
- I do not.
- You do it all the time.

02:37.436 --> 02:39.060
And you know what I end up with?
Wet dreams!

02:39.147 --> 02:41.222
I heard it as soon as I said it.
Just leave it alone.

02:41.315 --> 02:43.770
All right. Well, Cam,
it's just that sometimes...

02:43.859 --> 02:47.062
you can be a little,
you know, overenthusiastic.

02:47.154 --> 02:50.405
Is it really that big of a deal that I want
this to be the best show in the world?

02:50.491 --> 02:52.069
Well, as long as you heard me.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.994
Be in my corner. Don't be so critical.

02:55.079 --> 02:56.905
What... Is that really how you see me?

02:56.997 --> 02:58.622
Sometimes, yeah, I do, Mitchell.

02:58.708 --> 03:02.041
Oh, Cam.
Well, if that's true, then I'm sorry.

03:02.128 --> 03:06.420
No, okay. From now on,
I am in your corner, 100%.

03:06.506 --> 03:09.923
- And that song is gonna knock everyone out.
- Well, I don't know.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.418
- But wait till you see the dance I have prepared.
- A dance? A dance!

03:15.516 --> 03:18.719
- More toast, Manny?
- Why won't you call me, Emma?

03:18.811 --> 03:20.388
More toast, Emma?

03:20.478 --> 03:22.306
Do you have to be on all the time?

03:22.397 --> 03:24.934
Okay, I'm sorry.
Who is this Emma?

03:25.025 --> 03:26.519
She's in the show with me tonight.

03:26.609 --> 03:28.104
I'm thinking of taking a run at her.

03:28.195 --> 03:30.103
You don't take a run at a woman.

03:30.196 --> 03:32.485
You woo her. You make her feel special.

03:32.573 --> 03:33.819
Hey, hon, take a look at this.

03:33.908 --> 03:35.236
It's a picture of my butt.

03:35.327 --> 03:38.696
And then when you get her,
you can tell her whatever you want.

03:38.787 --> 03:40.199
Why do you do this?

03:40.289 --> 03:43.326
I programmed it so my butt pops up
when my brother Donnie calls.

03:43.417 --> 03:46.454
- It's a clever way of saying my brother's an ass.
- Is it?

03:46.545 --> 03:48.918
That's him. Compose yourselves.

03:49.007 --> 03:51.757
- Forget I showed you this picture.
- I'm trying.

03:52.760 --> 03:54.551
How you doing, you dumb son of a bitch?

03:54.637 --> 03:57.472
Hey, you old mick.
Looks like you put on a few pounds.

03:57.556 --> 03:59.384
Oh, you too.
What, are you eating your hair?

03:59.475 --> 04:01.550
Oh, Gloria. Oh.

04:01.643 --> 04:03.185
What are you still doing here?

04:03.270 --> 04:05.642
There's gotta be an easier way
to get a green card.

04:05.731 --> 04:08.649
- Uncle Donnie, are you coming to my
school concert tonight? - Well...

04:08.733 --> 04:10.312
- It's an hour, tops.
- Wouldn't miss it.

04:10.402 --> 04:11.897
You know, I think I misplaced my phone.

04:11.987 --> 04:14.394
- Could you call me on yours?
- My phone's at the bottom of my bag.

04:14.490 --> 04:16.398
- Why don't you use your home phone?
- Come on. It's simple.

04:16.491 --> 04:17.985
- What are you doing?
- I want the phone.

04:18.077 --> 04:20.233
- How about you let go?
- Give me the phone, Donnie!

04:20.329 --> 04:22.156
You still think you can take me?

04:22.247 --> 04:25.366
- Is this all you got, huh?
- I'm gonna wash your mouth out with fist.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.119
Ow! Ohh!

04:27.211 --> 04:30.413
- I don't understand this relationship, Emma.
- Ow! Ow!

04:37.803 --> 04:39.511
Hey, Emma.

04:39.598 --> 04:42.882
Doing the show, it feels like
we've become like a little family, huh?

04:42.975 --> 04:44.434
You mean like you're my brother?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.844
No. No, I don't.

04:46.937 --> 04:51.682
Oh, no! They're back! Dinosaur arms!

04:51.776 --> 04:53.567
This isn't a good time, Luke.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.146
That is hilarious.

04:55.238 --> 04:58.073
Half boy, half <i>T. Rex.</i>

04:58.157 --> 05:00.149
One foot in both worlds...

05:00.243 --> 05:03.197
wanted by neither.

05:03.286 --> 05:05.362
Luke, that's a great way to stretch out a shirt.

05:05.456 --> 05:08.207
Okay, okay. Break's over, everyone.

05:08.292 --> 05:09.751
Let's take it from the top.

05:09.836 --> 05:11.495
Listen, we're running 20 minutes long...

05:11.587 --> 05:13.543
so we're gonna go ahead
and cut the Bollywood number.

05:13.631 --> 05:15.623
Can I go? I'm late for soccer practice.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.551
You know who else
missed soccer practice, Delroy?

05:18.636 --> 05:20.794
The cast of <i>Rent.</i>
And now they have a Tony.

05:20.887 --> 05:22.631
We have a Tony.

05:22.722 --> 05:25.594
You are so funny.

05:25.684 --> 05:26.799
Seriously?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.091
Hello?

05:28.186 --> 05:30.226
 <i>Hey, honey, did
they drop the van off yet?</i>

05:30.314 --> 05:32.603
- Yeah, a little while ago.
<i>- How's it look?</i>

05:32.690 --> 05:35.940
Uh, well, believe it or not,
I have resisted the temptation to look.

05:36.028 --> 05:38.066
This whole Haley thing
has got me a little preoccupied.

05:38.154 --> 05:39.946
We're on our way out to lunch right now.

05:40.032 --> 05:42.570
<i>About that, I've been thinking.</i>
<i>College is still a ways away.</i>

05:42.658 --> 05:46.323
<i>I say we leave Haley alone.</i> <i>The more
we push,</i> <i>the more she'll push back.</i>

05:46.413 --> 05:48.370
- I'm gonna push.
<i>- And I support that.</i>

05:48.455 --> 05:52.501
Only Dad can make our minivan
even lamer.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.245
Excuse me. What are you doing?

05:54.337 --> 05:57.005
I'm driving this thing to the reservoir.
Just jump when I say jump.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.584
Honey, slide over.

06:02.637 --> 06:05.174
How is this stupid ad
supposed to sell houses anyway?

06:05.264 --> 06:09.427
You heard your father. He's not
just selling houses, he's selling us.

06:11.145 --> 06:13.469
What are my friends gonna think?

06:13.563 --> 06:16.351
They're gonna think that you're
helping your father put food on the table.

06:21.197 --> 06:23.320
- <i>Ay,</i> is the chair broken?
- Almost.

06:23.407 --> 06:26.444
That cheap, freeloading brother of mine
can't keep his hands off my good Scotch.

06:26.535 --> 06:28.742
So you see, I've placed that Scotch there.

06:28.829 --> 06:32.696
My brother sits in this chair, goes
out from under him. Bam. Masterpiece.

06:32.791 --> 06:35.744
So you make your brother fall
and spill his drink?

06:35.835 --> 06:39.371
- I don't want to jinx it, but that's the plan.
- Why are you both so mean?

06:39.465 --> 06:42.417
Where I come from,
brothers respect each other.

06:42.509 --> 06:44.466
That's why Colombia's
such a peaceful utopia.

06:44.552 --> 06:47.507
- Hello, ladies.
- Hey, nice shirt.

06:47.597 --> 06:49.256
Do they sell men's clothes
where you got that?

06:49.349 --> 06:51.092
That's funny because
woman are so inferior.

06:51.184 --> 06:54.137
You got no taste.
I bought this for Melanie's baptism.

06:54.228 --> 06:56.635
- Who's Melanie?
- Michael's kid. My granddaughter.

06:56.731 --> 07:01.606
Oh, I forgot to tell Irene I landed safely. Hello?

07:01.694 --> 07:04.648
How could you not know that your
own brother had a granddaughter?

07:04.739 --> 07:07.230
- I probably knew.
- How can you forget when he's family?

07:07.325 --> 07:09.780
I have 29 cousins, and I know them all.

07:09.868 --> 07:12.988
Rosa Marina, Gloria María,
Verónica, Mariana, José, Vicente...

07:13.081 --> 07:14.622
Okay, okay, okay. What's your point?

07:14.707 --> 07:17.244
You do the chair, you do the fighting...

07:17.334 --> 07:20.419
but you don't know each other... It's sad.

07:20.505 --> 07:23.077
Look, I may not talk to my brother
the way you talk to your sisters...

07:23.174 --> 07:25.843
but believe me,
we're close in our own way.

07:25.926 --> 07:27.884
When was the last time
that you saw him?

07:27.969 --> 07:30.887
That's not easy 'cause he lives up...

07:30.972 --> 07:33.759
I don't know. See, I wanna say Buffalo.

07:36.604 --> 07:40.435
All I'm saying is that
there's no downside to more education.

07:40.524 --> 07:42.017
I knew this car ride was a trap.

07:42.108 --> 07:46.023
See that? That right there shows me
just how smart you are.

07:46.113 --> 07:49.694
Really? Again? What is going on?

07:49.782 --> 07:51.988
It's the stupid ad.
They're honking on my side too.

07:52.076 --> 07:58.957
Oh. Yes, we're the people in the ad.
Yeah, hi. Hey.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.876
Another great thing about college...
complete independence.

08:01.962 --> 08:03.668
I'd have that in an apartment.

08:03.755 --> 08:06.589
No, because to have an apartment,
you would need a job.

08:06.673 --> 08:08.714
You want to know
what your job is in college?

08:08.802 --> 08:10.759
It's a little bit of class and homework...

08:10.844 --> 08:14.972
and it's a whole lot of
new friends and experiences...

08:15.058 --> 08:18.343
and the boys think you're cute,
and you are cute.

08:18.436 --> 08:20.927
And, oh, trust me,
that doesn't last forever.

08:21.021 --> 08:24.106
Call the number!

08:25.108 --> 08:28.229
All right! You in the mood to lose?

08:28.320 --> 08:31.071
First time for everything. You break.

08:31.157 --> 08:34.821
- So how's work?
- Don't worry, moneybags, I'm not here for a loan.

08:34.909 --> 08:36.736
Nice break.

08:36.828 --> 08:40.363
All right, you're solids, which you
won't be able to eat in a few years.

08:40.457 --> 08:43.030
Right, right. Seriously, though,
how are things going with you?

08:43.126 --> 08:46.330
They're swell.
I'm beating a fat guy at pool right now.

08:46.421 --> 08:48.663
- Donnie, I'm trying to talk to you.
- Why?

08:48.757 --> 08:50.666
Why? 'Cause that's what people do.

08:50.759 --> 08:53.331
Talk about things, like their lives.

08:54.929 --> 08:58.095
Ah, Irene opened her big trap.

08:58.182 --> 09:01.930
- Look, I'm fine. It's not like I'm gonna die.
- What?

09:02.020 --> 09:05.139
Yeah, they caught it early.
I took the treatment. I'm clear for now.

09:05.231 --> 09:07.355
- Come on, it's your shot.
- Caught what early?

09:09.027 --> 09:10.769
Donnie, are you talking about...

09:10.862 --> 09:12.356
cancer?

09:12.447 --> 09:14.735
You don't have to whisper. I know I got it.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.532
You just get <i>your</i> prostate checked.

09:16.618 --> 09:18.657
By a doctor, not some guy
you met on the Internet.

09:18.744 --> 09:21.531
- I can't believe you didn't tell me this.
- Because it's not a big deal.

09:21.622 --> 09:24.623
Listen, it's just between us.

09:24.709 --> 09:27.281
Oh, God.

09:29.380 --> 09:33.294
Irene, how the hell do I know
where your glasses are?

09:39.889 --> 09:43.306
And there's Frisbee golf, and you go
snow sledding on cafeteria trays.

09:43.393 --> 09:44.851
Oh, and you all get a dog together.

09:44.936 --> 09:47.308
I don't really know who takes care
of the dog during the summer...

09:47.398 --> 09:48.642
but he's there when you get back.

09:48.731 --> 09:50.559
Geez, maybe you should
just go back to college.

09:50.651 --> 09:53.935
Oh, honey, do you know
what I would give to go back?

09:54.029 --> 09:57.064
It's this moment when your whole life
is in front of you.

09:57.157 --> 09:59.944
And it's a magical time.

10:00.035 --> 10:03.404
And you don't want to miss that,
because when it's gone, it's gone.

10:03.496 --> 10:06.581
Yeah, yeah.

10:09.795 --> 10:11.585
Come on, Alex. Bus is leaving.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.579
Dad, your phone's been buzzing
like crazy.

10:13.673 --> 10:17.717
Sweet Lorna Doone.
Nineteen missed calls?

10:17.801 --> 10:20.553
I wonder who's...

10:20.638 --> 10:23.094
Phil Dunphy.

10:23.182 --> 10:25.969
You saw the ad? Great.

10:26.060 --> 10:28.018
Do you know what you're looking for?

10:28.103 --> 10:30.677
The little one. I think I know
which one you're talking about.

10:30.773 --> 10:34.985
Um, if you're interested, I also have
an older model with a lot of character.

10:35.069 --> 10:40.275
What? I think the carpet matches the drapes.
I haven't checked in a while.

10:40.365 --> 10:42.774
Both of them? Wow.

10:42.868 --> 10:45.538
Well, I guess that makes sense
if you're planning to flip one.

10:45.621 --> 10:48.955
Listen, um, why don't I call you back?
We'll set up an appointment.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.959
It will give me a chance to
give them both a good scrubbing.

10:52.044 --> 10:53.752
All right.

10:53.837 --> 10:56.210
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

10:56.298 --> 10:59.548
How about that, huh? You think
all these calls are about the ad?

11:00.469 --> 11:01.499
Yeah.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.720
My friend Nicole just sent me
a picture of the van.

11:06.182 --> 11:08.803
I guess I'll be seeing you Wednesdays
and every other weekend.

11:10.853 --> 11:11.850
<i>Hello?</i>

11:11.938 --> 11:14.096
Okay, um, you sound very angry...

11:14.191 --> 11:15.685
which is completely understandable.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.353
I'm not angry.

11:17.444 --> 11:20.562
I'm just sitting here thinking about
college and how life has passed me by.

11:20.654 --> 11:23.655
Oh, thank God. I'll see you at the show.
Love you. Bye. We gotta go.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.407
And as the music swells...

11:27.495 --> 11:31.113
we reveal our letters spelling
"We love the world."

11:31.206 --> 11:32.831
Powerful stuff.

11:32.917 --> 11:37.080
And then the majestic Franklin Middle
School insignia will drop into position...

11:37.170 --> 11:40.208
if Reuben ever finishes painting it.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.458
It's not the Sistine Chapel, Reuben.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.544
Surprise! Hi.

11:44.636 --> 11:48.680
Your supportive boyfriend dropped by
to bring you a snack. P.B. And J.

11:48.765 --> 11:50.889
Pear, Brie and jambon. My favorite.

11:50.975 --> 11:54.344
Okay, people, let's take five.
A true five!

11:55.731 --> 11:57.391
- Hey, Manny, how's it going?
- Hi.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.558
Good. Great. Uh, couldn't be better.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.106
Can we, uh...

12:02.195 --> 12:06.063
Yes, we can, uh... All right.

12:06.158 --> 12:09.858
- What's up?
- Okay, you gotta talk to Cam. He's driving us crazy.

12:09.953 --> 12:11.861
Kevin is biting his nails again.

12:11.954 --> 12:14.446
And Reuben hasn't had a bowel movement in a week.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.829
Don't laugh. That's how Elvis died.

12:16.917 --> 12:20.333
All right, uh, Manny.
I can't get involved, but...

12:20.422 --> 12:22.296
All right, if you have to say something...

12:22.381 --> 12:26.676
just tell Bob Fussy that he's overdoing it
and you wanna go back to your old stuff.

12:26.761 --> 12:30.806
Okay, break's over, people! I wanna do
the French Revolution number again.

12:30.889 --> 12:32.433
Let's bring out the guillotine.

12:32.517 --> 12:34.177
Carefully this time.

12:34.268 --> 12:36.676
- No. No, no.
- Excuse me?

12:38.523 --> 12:40.810
We don't wanna do the new stuff.

12:40.899 --> 12:44.649
We want to stop rehearsing
and go back to the old way, Bob Fussy.

12:45.862 --> 12:47.487
I don't know where this is coming from.

12:49.241 --> 12:51.151
You all feel this way?

12:51.243 --> 12:52.986
Yeah.

12:53.079 --> 12:55.866
Well, I had no idea.

12:55.956 --> 13:00.453
I had no idea I was surrounded
by a bunch of quitters.

13:00.544 --> 13:02.666
This production was a joke...

13:02.755 --> 13:07.417
until I introduced these children to the
musical theater greats... Bernstein, Sondheim.

13:07.508 --> 13:10.759
Years from now, some of these kids will still
be talking about the way I Sondheimized them.

13:10.846 --> 13:13.418
Ooh, I don't think
that's a good way of saying... Okay.

13:13.514 --> 13:15.092
You wanna do it the old way...

13:15.183 --> 13:18.136
with the same tired songs,
the same drab choreography...

13:18.228 --> 13:20.136
the same tepid applause
from Mom and Dad?

13:20.230 --> 13:22.305
Is that what you want? Just say the word.

13:22.399 --> 13:23.394
That's what we want.

13:23.483 --> 13:26.934
Well, too bad, people!
We're doing it my way! From the top!

Oh, just waiting for you 'cause I love you.
Haley, come out this side.

13:38.623 --> 13:40.366

- 'Cause it's fun. Try it.

- Hi.

13:42.042 --> 13:43.702
Ohh. Mmm.

Yeah, the doors slide, the seats slide.
What can't the Sienna do?

13:46.630 --> 13:48.125
- That <i>was</i> fun.
- Yeah, right?

13:48.216 --> 13:50.503
- Let's go see a show!
- Sweetie, we need to close the door.

13:50.593 --> 13:54.092
Yeah, with the key. I like to see how far I
can get from the car and still make it work.

13:54.179 --> 13:56.885
Listen, honey, honey. I need to ask you something.

13:56.974 --> 13:58.718
Okay, I need you to be
really honest with me.

13:58.809 --> 14:00.683
Yeah. You... Yes.

14:02.063 --> 14:05.893
- Are my best years behind me?
- What? No.

14:05.983 --> 14:09.066
The trick is to keep looking forward.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.901
Here we go. Yes, yes, for sure.

14:12.990 --> 14:14.780
