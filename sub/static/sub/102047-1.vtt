WEBVTT

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
without wheels

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
but the love we feel

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
the wilderness

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
the trip begins with a kiss

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
but the love we feel

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
No, no, no. Hello! Hello!

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Somebody!

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
No, please, no, no, please!
No, no, no, please!

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Please, please, please!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Please, please, please!

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Please. Oh, God.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Please, please,
please, help me!

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
the wilderness

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
-

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
-Yeah, it's blood.
- Good.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
I hope they bleed to death.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
It's the third time
in two months.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
There are 47 bulbs
in the letter "G."

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It's $3.10 a pop.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
That's $145.70, every time.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
That's an additional 13 dinners
I gotta sell just to float.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Are you listening to me?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Yes, sir.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Half our take is
from the interstate.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
You drive by, you look up...

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
Not exactly
a Happy Meal.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Morning, Deke.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Hey, Deke.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Yes, sir.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
You remember a punk named
JJ Kendricks?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Robbed the Quick Mart?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
We've got a witness
who ID'd him, but she's

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
All she knows for certain is
that he was wearing a really

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Fancy stitching.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
"Unforgettable," she says.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
But Kendricks is a suspect
in a robbery down in LA.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Down in LA?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
-Yeah.
-Is this headed somewhere?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Yeah. And so are you.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
There's a prelim
day after tomorrow

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
You drive to LA and bring back
the bloodstained boots,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
she ID's them,
and the judge

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
The blood, they definitely
ran the ABO on the blood?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
That's correct.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Then that means
this is a DA problem, Captain,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, no, it's our problem.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
No evidence, no conviction.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I got nobody else.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Yes, sir.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
Don't look at me like that.
You the one been gone

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Ah...

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'll see you tonight.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
I'm, uh, here to pick up
seized evidence.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Property said it was here.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Excuse you.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
Evidence is here, but it's not
leaving without a signature.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
-Ah.
-Uh-uh. Not yours.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
I need authorization
from Homicide to release.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
-There's
a preliminary tomorrow.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Captain Farris put a lock on
this item for testing.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
-It's already been tested.
-Don't I know it.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
He wants it re-tested.
Become a thing.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
So I hear.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Hey, look. You get me
a signature and, uh,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
wearing the damn things
for all I care.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
-

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Hey. Hey.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
This yours?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
-Yeah, unhook it.
-You blocked me in.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
Why didn't you just
ask me to move it?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
'Cause I don't have time.
You want special treatment?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
Go back to Kern County.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Unhook it.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
...all-hands-on-deck
approach to this case.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
To these cases.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Our city, our communities,
our citizens,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
and above all else...

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
these innocent victims
deserve no less.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
I don't know how many
times I need to tell you, man.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
Take it out of the file.
Please.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
...is that we're asking
for your help.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
If anyone has seen
or heard from anyone

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
that might somehow
be related to these cases...

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
Carl.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
I see Brother Love's...

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
salvation show's
still in operation.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Everybody needs a little faith.
Even you.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Got yourself a new disciple.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Great detective,
great guy.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
You should listen in,
you might learn something

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
-Anyway...
-The lab called.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Are you leaving town
when you're done?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
-You wanna take me to dinner?
-Want you out of here.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
They'll run the test
first thing in the morning

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
and if there's no match,
you're gone.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Tomorrow's no good.
My CO told me...

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Ah, I called your CO.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
He says you should hang
until the tests are complete,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
deliver the evidence tomorrow.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Good to see you, Captain.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Look at it this way...

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
give you a chance to visit all
those friends you left behind.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
Who says
that bad guys don't return

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
How's it feel
to be back in uniform?

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Still padding your overtime,
Rogers?

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
-Ooh. That's, uh,
Sergeant Rogers now, Deke. Yes.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
-Hmm.
-

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Your phone's ringing.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, I know.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
We are being meticulous
and methodical in our efforts.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Sergeant Rogers.
Yeah, but what did he say?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
...and we are
in the process of evaluating

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
-Nice to see you, Deke.
-Good to see you, too.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
...and gathering
additional evidence.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I can assure you all,
we are taking a 24/7,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
all-hands-on-deck approach
to this case.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
-These cases.
-

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Questions.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but what I'm hearing is

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
after two months
and four victims,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
you don't have a suspect.

11:06.000 --> 11:09.000
None that I can discuss.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Four dead girls, Jimmy.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
We haven't been
under this much scrutiny

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
There's talk.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Sheriff hinted that
we might wanna reach out

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
-Are you kidding me?
-Some point.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
Some point, Jimmy.
Not today.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
Deke?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Son of a bitch.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
-The man, the myth, the legend.
-Hey, Sal.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
You still hanging around?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
No rest for the ugly.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
-What are you doing here?

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Eh, don't ask, don't tell.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
I'm just going
across the street,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Come on,
what's one cup of coffee?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
All right.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Who is that, talking to Sal?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Kern County patrol dep.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
That's Joe Deacon.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
You're kidding.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
No.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
They're
a bunch of nancies.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
End of shift, I gotta beg for
somebody to grab a beer with.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
They got no soul,
these new guys.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
They weeded all the heart
out of the place.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
But then, you know that
better than anybody.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
-Hey, Sarge.
-Sal.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
-You know Joe Deacon?
-Get what you came for?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
I will.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
You got nothing better to do
than to bust my balls

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Nothing personal.
Deke busts everybody's balls.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You wanna bullshit
John Q. Public

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
into thinking that
the worst is behind us,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
that's your business,
until the next time,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
but, hey,
it's your shift, right?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, it is.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
I hear you're a good cop.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I hear things, too.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
He is a good cop, Deke.
College boy,

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
bit of a Holy Roller,
but, hey, I've been thinking

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Get on the fast track
for a promotion.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Sal, we're up.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
You wanna stay with me
and the wife tonight?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Ah, nope.
Thank you, though.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
-Good to see you, Deke.
-Good to see you, too, brother.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
Why don't you
ride over with me?

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Maybe you can even
give me a few pointers.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
-

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
Everybody outside, nobody in.
Dollar to a dime,

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Baxter. 362071.
What's everybody

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Power's off
inside the victim's building.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
-You call Edison?
-They're working on it now.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
You been inside?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
-How big's the place?
-Two-room efficiency.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Due to the victim's
body position,

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
access is through the adjacent
apartment's fire escape.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
We got generators on the truck.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
Nah, let's let
the wazoo boys go to work.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
You wanna superglue
the whole apartment?

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Why not?
We're dead in the water

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
-You familiar
with all of this?

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Things probably changed a lot
since you left.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Still gotta catch him, right?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Not that much
has changed, then.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Anybody want some menthol?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Everyone eat?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
All right.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
Lights off.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Holy shit!

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
by The Cucumbers

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Don't watch it

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
Don't watch it

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Arterial wound...

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
stab wound, body cavity.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
Another stab wound.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
She crawled to here...

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
all the way to here.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
This is where she died.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
So, why is she there?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
They lift prints
from this window?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Hey, Jimmy,
they dust that ledge yet?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
Get me the first officer.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Still making house calls,
eh, Flo?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
Oh, good Lord.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
-You in town for a while?
-No.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Stick around till I'm finished.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Okay.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Joe Deacon, meet Julie Brock.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
Julie's 5'4", a buck 20,
and hails from

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
This job sucks.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Hey.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
Our killer exited the same way
we came in.

16:46.000 --> 16:51.000
It's your responsibility to
secure and protect the premises

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
From the moment she expired
to the time I cuff

16:56.000 --> 16:57.000
we work for her.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
-Yes, sir.
-Get out of here.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
It's starting
to look a lot like Illinois.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
-It's Michigan.
-Cut it out.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
This been dusted?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah,
but it's broken.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
Not all of it.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
Hey.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
When's your boy, Columbo,
gonna break my case for me?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Deke's got his own style.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
We're still
processing out that room.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
What do you got, Flo?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
She assumed room temperature
two or three days ago.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
-We'll know more
when we take her in.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
Check the closets.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Postmortem lividity.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.000
She was moved.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
All right, canvass the block,
knock on every door,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Find out Julie's habits,
friends, suitors, enemies.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
They get anything
across the alley?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
They lifted a print,
tested stains on the floor

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Pull files on any known
sex offenders in the area.

19:58.000 --> 20:03.000
Peeping Toms,
neighborhood arrests,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Lean on the lab for prints,
all right?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Jamie, lean on 'em.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Okay.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Awfully quiet
back there, Kojak.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.000
-Am I missing something?

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
Any of the other girls
have bites?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Carrie Holland.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
One of 'em. Why?

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Similar to a case up north,
that's all.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Deacon.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Sal says you're here overnight.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
How about you buy me breakfast?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Why would I wanna do that?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
All right, I'll buy.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.000
Nick's, 0800.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
If I'm still here.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Go again on Wednesday?

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, sure. I'll run you home.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Three blocks. I'll be fine.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
-Night.
-Bye.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Yeah,
surprised the DA, too.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
She made a second-degree offer.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Kendricks copped a plea.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
What about
the unforgettable boots?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Forget 'em. Don't need 'em.
Neither will Kendricks.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Not where he's going.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Morning.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
-Morning.
-Look, I know it was you

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
spotted the observatory
across the street last night.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Might have missed that one
without you.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
You're welcome.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
-When you leaving?
-Right now.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh, that's a shame.
I got something you might

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
He got picked up twice
for peeping in

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Sheet says he's a KSO.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Stan Peters.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Picked up this morning
on a Ramey warrant.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Letting him stew a bit.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
He wants a mouthpiece.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
You might wanna stay.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Nice boots.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
Hi, Stan. Jim.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
-Where's my lawyer?
-In the building.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Takes a while.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
A girl from
your neighborhood...

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
dead.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
And you,
a known sex offender...

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
I was taking a piss
and I was in the alley.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
You had your dick out.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
This girl...
- Teenage girl, Stan.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
She was just walking by.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
You gotta believe me.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
I want to.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I got nothing to do with this.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
Yeah.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
What can you tell me
about Mary Roberts?

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Mary Roberts.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Mary Roberts,
Stan Peters?

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Dead girl, suspect.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Was he your boy?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
You never know.
Just saying hello

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
Well, your old pal says
you broke his jaw once.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.000
You gotta kiss a lot of frogs
to find your prince.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
What are you
still doing here?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
Just leaving.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Order up the poor boy
on a Mary Roberts.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
I'm going for a sandwich.
You want one?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Nah, I'm good.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
The Rathbuns are waiting.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Missing person.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, they think
their daughter Ronda's a stat.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
We got a corpse?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Then it's still
Missing Persons.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
So crazy, girl.
You're gonna fly out of here.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
-

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Don't you ever get tired
of looking at dead bodies?

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
I could ask you the same.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
What's this all about, Joe?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Similar case up north.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
-Thanks for doing this
for me, Flo.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
She won't see the knife
till tomorrow.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
Well, she won't see
another knife.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
General proximity,
similar pattern and depth

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
The garbage bag
was an adornment

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Maybe when the guy came back.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Came back?

27:47.000 --> 27:50.000
Unless he was a babysitter,
he made a return trip,

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
moved the girl and propped her
up against the door.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
Now, turn that up for me.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Okay.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
Mm... KHRT. Love songs
of the '50s and '60s. Mm.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
You get a dental on the bites?

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Right. Uh...

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
Yeah, we did a rush on it.
Inconclusive.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
It could be
the same as we found

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
More sucking, less biting.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Any saliva samples?

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
Funny you should ask.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I found traces
of sodium benzoate

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
-What's that?
-Used in mouthwash. Toothpaste.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
And check this out.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
He gave her a postmortem shave.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
Nicked her, no blood.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.000
What about her D-tract?

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
She had one good meal
before she died.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Speaking of which, you hungry?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
I'll buy if you pull up
an old file for me.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Case up north, my ass.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
The fuck is going on, Joe?

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
I'll pull your file.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
But if something goes wrong,
I can't be there for you again,

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Okay.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
You knew him, didn't you?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
That's why he did that
to your face.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.000
You let him in.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
You thought...

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
"Eh...

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Not my type," but...

29:44.000 --> 29:47.000
maybe he could be
a friend. I mean,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
you can't get enough of them.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
But then you had
that one little feeling.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
You thought, "What if?"

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
But you waved it away.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Thought, "Ah, what the hell?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Life's too short."

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And you were right.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Life is too short, Julie.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
And you should've listened.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
You should've listened to
that one little feeling, but...

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
Just like I'm listening
to you now.

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
You can talk to me.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm all the friend you got.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
You know my take
on the world, Joe?

30:48.000 --> 30:51.000
There's good and there's bad,

30:52.000 --> 30:53.000
but you gotta fight.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Because, brother...

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
when I look in your eyes,

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
what I see...

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
it ain't good.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
To remind me of what I did.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
For what we did.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I thought
you guys were finished.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
How long has this, uh,
fridge been broken?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't know. A week, maybe.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You're responsible for repairs?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Oh, are you thinking
about moving in?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
No, ma'am.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
I called a guy to come fix it,
but, uh, then, you know,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
So, suddenly,
it didn't seem so important.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
And, I mean, look.
I gotta paint the walls

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
-Who'd you call?
-

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Uh, a place
around the corner.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
AB... ABC Appliance.
Something like that.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.000
And the stuff in the fridge
was already rotten?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
-Yeah, yeah.
-Mm-hmm. Except the milk?

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
-My kid drank it, so cuff me.
-Oh.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
-Anything else?
-In the fridge?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
There were a few beers. Why?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.000
I'm gonna need it for evidence.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
For evidence.
Yeah, okay.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
-Coming right up.
-All righty.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
How do you
ever get used to it?

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
What's that, ma'am?

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
The smell.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
You know, if you're lucky,
you don't get used to it.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
Here.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Close up when
you're done, okay?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't want any trouble.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
I have no connection
to the girls out front.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
-Just need a room.
-Oh.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
$20 a night, $100 a week.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
There are some things in there
from the last guy.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Just toss 'em in the hallway.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
And don't worry,
the sheets are clean.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.000
Hey!

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
Do you want some company?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Good night. I love you.
-  Love you.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
-I love you.
-Love you.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
-Did you say your prayers?
-Yep.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
-I'll see you tomorrow.
- Night.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Good night.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
Hey.
- Mm?

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
Did you set the alarm?

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
Yeah.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
It's never over.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
Re-interview the immigrants
in the Brock apartment.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Jimmy.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
All of 'em.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.000
Close it.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
-Stan Peters.
-What about him?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Killed himself last night.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
That's not good.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
What the hell's this got to do
with Kern County?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Deacon watched
through the glass.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
He's got a similar case
up north.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It's just a little
interagency cooperation.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Guy hasn't worked a murder
since we ran him off

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
Do you know the book on him?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
A great detective,
has a heart attack,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
leaves town
for a post in the sticks.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
The guy worked
the case so hard,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
he got a suspension,
a divorce and a triple bypass,

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
Complete meltdown.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
He's a rush-hour train wreck.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.000
That's a tad dramatic.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Only good came out of it,
we got you.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
What are you saying?
I took his spot?

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
Manner of speaking, yeah.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
Piece of personal advice,
Jimmy,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.000
you got a good thing
going here.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Don't get mixed up
with this guy.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
What's the big deal? He's gone.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
His CO says
he's taken vacation days.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
-Yeah, so what?
-Does he strike you

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
as the kind of guy
that plays golf?

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Employee list.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Repair appointment book.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.000
Look for yourself.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
So, I could
even have it delivered

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
All you gotta do is go out and
get some food, put it in there,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
your kids are gonna be happy,
you're ready to go.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Excuse me a minute.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
-What can I do for you?
-I'm Joe Deacon.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
I need to see all repair orders
for the last two weeks,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
and a list
of all your employees.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Thank you.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
It's okay.
You're not under arrest.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
Yet.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
This one's crossed out.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
-It's a cancellation.
-Yeah?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
That's before
I can get a man out.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
And it always takes that long?

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Hey, we're busy.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Yeah.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, I see.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And this is the list?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Mm...

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Mm.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
-And your name is?
-Jack.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
You all right, Jack?

39:59.000 --> 40:00.000
What's your last name, Jack?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.000
Aboud.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.000
Thank you, Jack Aboud.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
You don't mind
if I take your list, do you?

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Salaam alaikum.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Thanks, Jack.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Did you look at my print
from the Brock apartment?

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
It's no good
without one to compare to.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
The center's missing
and the computer can't

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Look on the bright side,
the guy finally left a partial.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
What exactly is it you guys do?

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
We make you look good in court.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
-Dad!

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
Anything else?
Jewelry, maybe?

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
A red barrette.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
When she ran, she always
used to wear a red barrette

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
I'm gonna find her.

42:46.000 --> 42:52.000
in clover

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Jesus.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
-

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
It's not her.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Really? This how you
spend your time off?

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
When's the last time
you saw two hoop-dees

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
and a meat wagon
going 20 miles an hour?

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
They didn't wanna come
any more than I did.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
What have you got?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Deceased fits the MO.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Stab wound, ligature,
killed elsewhere.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
-She a floater?
-Yeah.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
But they dumped overflow
in here a few days back.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.000
Guessing there's mud
in her cavities.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Shallow grave, most likely.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
You ready to tell me
about Mary Roberts?

43:54.000 --> 43:58.000
Your boy, Stan Peters,
swallowed a 12-gauge

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
Hey, Jimmy,
come give a look.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
If you didn't know
any better, from up here...

44:34.000 --> 44:37.000
you might say it's beautiful.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
Sal told me you went to bat
for me with Farris.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
It's not a wise career move.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
You're not exactly
a department favorite.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Maybe I can make it up to you.

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
You might wanna
run these names.

44:53.000 --> 44:58.000
They were working
in appliance stores

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It's a long shot.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Aren't they all?

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
Thank you.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Something I gotta know.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
How's a guy with
the best clearance rate

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
work 15 years
without a promotion?

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
Maybe I didn't go
to the right church.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.000
Hm.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Do you believe in God, Joe?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
When I see a sunrise
or thunderstorm

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
or dew on the ground,
yes, I think there's a God.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
When I see all this,
I think he's long past

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
I still owe you breakfast.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Yes, you do.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
This is great.
Thank you.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
You're welcome.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
Joe's in Kern County now.

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
Mm. Your wife drag you away?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
I'm divorced.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Oh. Well, I'd like to
get out of the city,

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
-Hm.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
You work homicide there, too?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Uh, no, ma'am. I'm just a...

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
a dep.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Hi.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
Hi.
-My precious.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
That's Mr. Deacon, Chloe.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
How do you do?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Very well.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Do you have any kids, Joe?

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
Uh, two girls. They're...
they're all grown now.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
All grown up.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
I'm gonna be late.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
-We ready to take
Jen to school, baby?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Got a parent-teacher conference
until 5:00,

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
so the girls are gonna stay
at Mom's until dinner.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
That's fine.
-Okay. I love you.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Where are you going?

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Nice to meet you, Joe.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
-She's beautiful.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.000
They all are.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
-Yeah.
-

47:04.000 --> 47:07.000
I'll run the names on the list.
Where can I reach you?

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
St. Agnes.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
I've heard of
living on the beat,

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Wanna meet after shift,
compare notes?

47:13.000 --> 47:16.000
You may have to ask
the Reverend Captain

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
It's my case.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
You look good, Marsha.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
-You too, Joe.
-Thank you.

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
I was just on my way to work.
If I'd known

47:47.000 --> 47:48.000
Gotta get going anyway.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
-Let me...
let me grab my purse.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
-House looks good.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Glad you kept it.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Lawn, too.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Yeah, well, Tom's a...

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
He's a wiz in the yard.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Better than me.

48:08.000 --> 48:11.000
Well, you never really had time
for that kind of thing.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
How are the girls?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
-Good.
-Good.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
You ought to give 'em a call.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Yeah. Yeah.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.000
Yeah.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Yeah, I should.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
You all right?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
You know me.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
I know you.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
Well...

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
I gotta...

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
All right.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Bye, Joe.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Bye, Marsha.

48:59.000 --> 49:04.000
Mary Roberts.
Paige Callahan, Tamara Ewing.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
I only asked for Roberts.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Yeah, well,
all the victims were hookers,

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
they were all found drugged
and stabbed to death

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
on the same night
in the same location.

49:11.000 --> 49:12.000
You gotta be kidding me.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Yeah, I'm hilarious.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
-

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I never figured
you to be so hip.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Yeah, they must have...

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
must have changed owners.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
You want something to drink?

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Don't worry, I won't tell.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Where are you from? Originally.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
The Valley.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Where are you from?

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
-Originally.
-Mississippi Valley.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
Alabama, Birmingham.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Well, here's to being
from somewhere.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.000
All right,
last night's victims...

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
so we got six now.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
One, Julie Brock,
never left home.

49:58.000 --> 49:59.000
Three from the north county,
bodies dumped here.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
Two from here,
bodies dumped in north county.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
And who said
busing doesn't work?

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
All knifed, all gagged,
all bound,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
all very organized killings.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
Not a lot of wasted motion.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
-So, I got a question. Why?
-Why what?

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
First, geography.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
Yep. Guy's a shark.
If he stops, he dies.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
He likes to drive.
Probably has a decent car.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
Maybe two. High mileage.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
Can't find one
in the neighborhood, a victim,

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
then, uh, he goes
wherever opportunity knocks.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
All right, next "why."
Why the extreme torture,

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
Turns him on.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
No rape, no sodomy,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
-no genital mutilation. Hm.
-He kills for sexual pleasure.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
Was Stan Peters our boy?

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
God, I hope not.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
All right, back to the living.
Our boy.

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
He's got balls.
I'll give him that.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
He goes back to Julie's house,

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
a few days after he kills her,
moves her body,

50:51.000 --> 50:55.000
poses her, he brings beer,

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
milk, food. Just threw
himself a little party.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
And they found partially
digested meat in her stomach.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
But she was a vegan.
Strict vegetarian.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
She'd never touch it.
Same as Ana. No way.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.000
Not even with a knife
to her throat?

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
Nobody wants to eat alone.

51:08.000 --> 51:09.000
Mm.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.000
One last "why."

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Why are you trying to solve
a five-year-old case

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
that everyone else
has forgotten about?

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
Farris and I were...

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
a couple of miles away.
We heard a call over the radio.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Screams reported.
Sal was first one on the scene.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
No lights.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
Switching problem.
Guy from Edison said it happens

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Now, you see the woman
behind me

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
-over my left shoulder?
-Yeah.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Gladys Fulcher. Spinster.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
Sort of eyes and ears
of the neighborhood.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
A pain in the ass to the cops
but a godsend to a detective.

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
And what did good old
Gladys have to say?

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Said she was out.
She lied about it at first

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
but she came clean.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.000
What was she embarrassed about?

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
She went on her
first date in 15 years,

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
So, the night of the hat trick,
we had no lights,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Gladys getting boned...

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
two-million-to-one long shot
crossing the finish line

52:39.000 --> 52:40.000
in a dead heat.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Third strike.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Drought.

52:46.000 --> 52:50.000
No water, no mud, no prints.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Ground was hard like cement.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Victims were placed
on that rock right there.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
They were drugged elsewhere,
but they were brought here,

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Posed facing each other,

53:03.000 --> 53:07.000
bags over their heads,
laid down, like the rock

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
tea party.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Where the guests fell asleep.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Warm. This just went down.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
And where was
your third victim?

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Close by.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
You work the evidence,
you still come up with zeros.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
It's all you can do.
Happens to everybody.

53:31.000 --> 53:36.000
Then you draw the black bean.

53:36.000 --> 53:40.000
Maybe the victim looks like
a kid you picked on in school

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
or the green eyes
remind you of your old lady.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
Or maybe it's something else,
but whatever it is,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
they're your lifelong
responsibility, Jimmy.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
You own them.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
You own them.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
They're wherever they are,
and you are their angel,

54:08.000 --> 54:14.000
trying like hell to turn the
ledger from red to black.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
Word to the wise, Jimmy,
stay out of the angel business.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Hey.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
What is it you're looking for
in all of this?

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
To finish the job.

54:32.000 --> 54:35.000
Just like you.

54:35.000 --> 54:36.000
It's not the same boy.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Guys that kill pros
are a different breed

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
than the ones
that go after solid citizens.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Yeah, nobody's that good
out of the block.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
This boy practiced his trade
somewhere before.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.000
Well, it can't be the same guy.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.000
He's a shark, remember?
He stops, he dies.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Who said he stopped? Maybe he
just took his show on the road.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm over here on the right.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Two of the five appliance
store employees have records.

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
One's 55, the other one's
in his late thirties,

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Both simple assaults.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
It looks like a wash to me,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
but you got all the info there.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
And for the record, your hunch?
I don't think it holds water.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Then why all the interest?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
You wanna
clear your conscience,

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
But you gotta solve my case to
solve yours, who am I to moan?

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
But you piss on my leg
and call it rain,

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
Hey, uh, what was
Julie's last supper?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
It was roast beef. Why?

55:31.000 --> 55:35.000
It's the little things
that are important, Jimmy.

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
It's the little things
that get you caught.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Can I help you?

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I saw
the "for sale" sign.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
That was for another car.

56:35.000 --> 56:38.000
Got a lot of miles on it.
You a... you a salesman?

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
No.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
How's the trunk space?

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
It's standard.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Mind if I take a look?

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
I'm in the market.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.000
It's not for sale.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
All I need to do is
take a look.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.000
You must really like my car.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
-I do.
-

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Hey, Sal, listen.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
Run a DMV check
on an Albert Leonard Sparma.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Yeah, see if he's sold any cars
in the last few months.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Inconclusive.

58:19.000 --> 58:22.000
But there are some similarities
to both Brock and Ewing.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Partial of an incisor
on Ewing's cheek.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
What about Brock?

58:26.000 --> 58:29.000
Partial of a bicuspid.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
-Something else.
-What's that?

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
He's from back east.

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Folds his slice.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
to my guy

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
you could buy

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
to my guy

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
my word of honor

59:24.000 --> 59:29.000
and I'm gonna...

59:43.000 --> 59:47.000
to be exact

59:47.000 --> 59:50.000
as a matter of fact

59:50.000 --> 59:54.000
could take my hand

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.000
We'll canvass over here.

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.000
You have a good night.

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:06.000
We got roast beef,
we got strippers...

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000
Baby, you got anything
for us tonight?

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000
We got hookers.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:14.000
Damn, homie.

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000
You don't know
how lucky y'all are.

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:46.000
Okay.

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000
How's the trunk space?

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000
-Baxter.
-The second girl,

1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000
where did you find her?

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.000
Couple hundred yards after 126.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:03.000
-And you didn't leak it
to the press?

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000
You sure about that?

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000
It went out over dispatch,
but it was never given

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.000
What's the nearest mile marker?

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.000
Hang on.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000
467.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000
4-6-7.

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:37.000
There's this guy Deke asked me
to run a vehicle check on.

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000
Seems that Topanga Tow
has a car registered to him.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000
Found it abandoned
two weeks ago.

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.000
Reported stolen?

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.000
No.

1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000
Well, tow that sucker in.

1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000
-Wine.
- Damn it.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.000
Sal, what do you got?

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:59.000
Clean. 22,000 miles.

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.000
-A rollback?
-Definitely.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.000
All right, keep at it.
Let me know

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000
Here we go.

1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:08.000
I'll take the prints.
Call the lab,

1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:12.000
Grab Deke and a patrol dep,
pick up Sparma.

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000
What about Tina Salvatore,
the potential witness?

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.000
Get her a magazine.

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000
What are the chances
he'll let us in?

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000
Yeah. Just keep him busy,
keep him talking.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000
Tell him to take his time,
change his clothes, whatever.

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:33.000
Match is inconclusive.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000
-Conclude it.
-Eleven identifiers.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000
County requires 18 for an ID,
LAPD requires 12.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000
So, we're one short of
somebody's legal requirements?

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000
-That says something.
-It says you're seven short.

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:47.000
Look me in the eye
and tell me this isn't my boy.

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:48.000
This other fella...

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000
let's call him Mr. X...

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000
he's got eight identifiers.
Only three less than Sparma.

1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000
Maybe he's the killer.

1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.000
Who?

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:07.000
Thank you.

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000
Are we ready to go?

1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000
It's like
I told the police...

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000
it was dark, he was
wearing glasses, a hat...

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000
If I showed you some photos,
do you think you'd be able to

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.000
Maybe.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.000
Probably not.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000
Nothing. It was like
he was expecting us.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.000
Get her something to drink.
Keep an eye on her.

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000
I have to use the restroom.

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000
Come on.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000
It's, uh, right over here,
to your right.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:53.000
Hey, you got a second, Jamie?

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000
It's okay. I can find my way
back to your desk.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.000
All right,
do you want anything to drink?

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:00.000
Uh... Diet anything.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000
Just come straight back, okay?

1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:05.000
-What's up?
-Thanks.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000
The Harvester was clean
as a whistle.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000
Damn it.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000
Got this off your desk.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000
You don't mind if I move
the table, do you?

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000
Do your thing.

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000
Grab the other end.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000
All clear.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000
Bring him in.

1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:41.000
Okay, Jerry.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000
Well, what did you have to do
to get a job like this?

1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:54.000
Kind of a demotion, huh?

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000
No, we're not gonna need those.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000
Where's big Dick Tracy?

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000
Is he joining us for dinner?

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000
Ow. Man...

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000
Hello, Albert.

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000
I'm Detective Sergeant Baxter.

1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000
I know who you are.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000
You're famous.

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.000
On television and in the papers
all the time.

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:21.000
Thank you so much.

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000
I'm kind of a crime buff.

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000
Hm.

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000
Well, then you know
if you're innocent,

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000
you should talk to me,
clear your name.

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000
Is that it?

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000
Not gonna work me over,
Mr. Clean?

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000
Okay.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000
I invoke my
Fifth Amendment right

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000
Just kidding.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000
You should see
the look on your faces.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000
Come on, it's hilarious.

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000
But I would like my rights
waiver card.

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000
I know I'm not
officially in custody, but...

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000
better be safe than sorry,
huh, guys?

1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:12.000
Hot damn.

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000
This is awesome.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000
Can I keep this?

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000
No, I'm afraid not.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
No fun.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:29.000
Hey, you wanna know something?
Ernesto Miranda...

1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000
was actually guilty.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:36.000
Why did you abandon
your car, Albert?

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000
The Harvester.
Had a big back end, was good

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000
Look, Jimmy.

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000
-Detective Baxter.
-Whatever.

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000
Like I said,
the car was stolen.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000
I'll drive it home.

1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000
We'll be hanging on to it
for a few days.

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000
Well, that's not
very nice of you.

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.000
Why didn't you
report the theft?

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000
Well, you see,
that's the funny thing.

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000
I did.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000
Somebody's got some
homework to do.

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:13.000
Mm. Cute little thing,
wasn't she?

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000
-Who said she's dead?
-I know the drill, Jimmy.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000
But the truth is...

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000
I'm not the guy.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:22.000
Besides, if you had anything...

1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000
anything at all...

1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000
I'd be under arrest...

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000
wouldn't I?

1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000
Do you want to be?

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000
I wouldn't mind getting
a peek at all that evidence

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000
Is that for me?

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000
You get the feeling
he's enjoying this?

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000
Oh, yeah.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000
Pineapples and jalapenos,
please.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000
Can I come in?

1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000
Eleven more,
you can make a calendar.

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000
Uh-oh.

1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000
Oh, hey, stranger.

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:08.000
Tired of steaming up
that glass?

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:10.000
Pressies?

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000
Oh, yeah.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:22.000
This is the part where I start
feeling like it's a trap.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000
Open it up, find out.

1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000
It's not a pair of mittens.

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000
Wow.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.000
Go on, take a look.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.000
You know you want to.

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.000
Open it, you fucking weirdo.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000
Holy guacamole.

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:14.000
catch a dead girl by her toe.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:18.000
Oh...

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:24.000
The contrast is all off.

1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:27.000
It's no Weegee.

1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000
My God.

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000
Let me ask you a question.

1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:08.000
Why is that?

1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.000
Huh?

1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000
Why is that?

1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000
Hm? Come on,
you're a smart man.

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000
You know every exit
on the highway.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000
Let me help you.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000
I mean it.

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000
Why?

1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:52.000
Why not?

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:56.000
Son of a bitch.
Your dick is as hard

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000
-Shit.
-Son of a...

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000
Deke! Hey, Deke!
- That's why.

1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000
-That's why.
- Back off!

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000
-Why is that? Why is that?
- Deke! Hey! Whoa!

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.000
-That's what I wanna know.
- Back off.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000
Hey. Hey.

1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.000
It's all right.
It's all right, Sal.

1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000
We know, you know...

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000
...we got you by the balls,
small as they are.

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000
You son of a bitch.

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.000
You lost control.

1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:31.000
-Rizoli.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000
-Huh. Jimmy, it's your wife.
-Take a message.

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000
What do you think?

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000
Maybe if I could
get a better look at him.

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:56.000
What do you mean,
a better look?

1:15:57.000 --> 1:16:01.000
Well, at this guy.

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.000
I mean, you have him
here in the station, right?

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.000
Thank you, Tina.

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:23.000
Look, I'm sorry.
What about a lineup?

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.000
We've got no cause.

1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:26.000
I mean, the ID is
tainted beyond repair.

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:29.000
She saw him in cuffs,
for God's sake.

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000
I told you.
I warned you.

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:31.000
I take the heat.

1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000
-I'm the primary.
-For now.

1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000
What the hell does that mean?

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:38.000
It means I got six bodies,
no witnesses, no evidence,

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:41.000
Two guys questioned,
and why are they suspects?

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000
One, who later sucks
on a 12-gauge,

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.000
for malicious unzipping.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.000
The other, for carrying
a concealed hard-on.

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.000
-What do you want the DA to do?
-He was visualizing the crime.

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:51.000
His crime.

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:52.000
Well, sheriff's calling
in the feds.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000
They got a guy
coming in on Monday.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:56.000
That point, we back off,
we revamp.

1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:00.000
-Revamp?
-They take charge.

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000
Hey, uh, one more thing.

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:09.000
Were you aware Sparma confessed
to a murder eight years ago?

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000
Guy walks in...

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000
and we spent ten hours
going over the thing.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.000
He signs a confession.
Next morning, we had

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.000
-Why?
- He was lying.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:21.000
I mean,
he knew all the details,

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.000
but he wasn't within
ten miles of the killing.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000
Still got two days, right, Cap?

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000
Hey, what is it with
you and Deke?

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:36.000
You wanna be the one
that finds him after his

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000
It's his destiny,
don't make it yours.

1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000
Deacon.

1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.000
Boo.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000
What is... what is all this?

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000
The past becomes the future,
becomes the past...

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000
becomes the future,
becomes the past,

1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:52.000
-Hey. Look at me.
-Becomes the future.

1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.000
This is sick.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000
-You need to get some help.
-Don't point fingers.

1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000
I know all the symptoms.

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000
Congratulations.
We got a suspect.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000
Oh, we do, do we?

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:05.000
Yeah.

1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000
Are you aware that Sparma
confessed to a murder

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.000
So what?

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:11.000
He walked in,
jerked Rogers' chain

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000
He's a crime buff,
he said so himself.

1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000
Walk-in confessors
aren't killers.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.000
We don't have shit!

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000
You got the same ache
in your gut as I do, don't you?

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000
We got something,
we just don't know what it is.

1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:25.000
If I can get in Sparma's
apartment for just

1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000
We don't have enough
for a warrant.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:27.000
...like I'm standing
in front of you.

1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.000
I know.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
Know what?

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000
I know that the answer is
inside Sparma's place. I know.

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000
Let me ask you something,
Jimmy.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:43.000
What do you want?

1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000
I wanna nail the bastard.

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000
For who?

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:49.000
For all of the girls he killed.

1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:53.000
And for Ronda Rathbun,
wherever she is.

1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:56.000
Well, I wanna
nail the bastard, too.

1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000
Difference is...

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000
I'm doing it for me.

1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:06.000
Just five minutes, Jimmy.

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:09.000
Please.

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000
I'm sorry
about what happened today,

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:14.000
and I'd like to
make it up to you in person.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:19.000
Meet me at Pike's,
near your place, on the bully.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000
That the place
with potato skins?

1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:38.000
We'll see.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000
He comes back,
I'll hit the horn twice.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000
7-0, respond.

1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000
Code seven, Fifth and Main.

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:10.000
Hey, you got a phone?

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000
Yeah.

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000
It's local.

1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000
And a Shirley Temple to go.

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:50.000
Officer down.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000
Repeat, officer down.

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:55.000
10929 San Marina Street.

1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000
Repeat, officer down.

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000
LAPD, open up!

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000
Going right.

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:34.000
Hey!

1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000
LA Sheriff. What's going on?

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:37.000
There's an officer down.
Two guys inside now.

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000
Hey, hey, hey.
All respect, Detective,

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000
your jurisdiction doesn't start
for another 20 blocks. Move.

1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000
Sheriff's.
-Baxter. 362071.

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.000
How can I help you?

1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000
Detective Baxter.

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000
Detective--

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000
Bathroom's clear.
-Clear.

1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000
Sparma called in
an "officer down."

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:03.000
Wily son of a bitch.

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.000
Wily enough to keep his
apartment clean?

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:08.000
He's got a box full of
knickknacks and souvenirs.

1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:09.000
By any chance,
did you see a red barrette?

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000
-Red barrette?
-Yeah.

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000
Ronda Rathbun was wearing one
when she disappeared.

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.000
You give me five more minutes,
I can find out for you.

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000
All right, bad news first.

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:39.000
Sparma did file
a stolen on the wagon.

1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:40.000
The good...

1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.000
Sparma left town less than
six weeks after your murders.

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000
Where'd he go?

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.000
Detroit.

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000
Any unsolved bodies up there?

1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000
Detroit?

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000
Right.

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000
He knows we're here.
He knows we're watching him.

1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000
Good.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000
I want him to know.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:10.000
Do you ever wonder...

1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:13.000
that maybe, just maybe,
it's a waste of time?

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:17.000
All this sitting, waiting...

1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:22.000
watching, spending your life
in another man's shadow.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.000
One, wherever he goes,
I mark it for search warrants.

1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.000
Two, he tries it again,
I catch him in the act.

1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000
Three, when I'm with him...

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000
nobody dies.

1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:38.000
Nobody dies on my watch.

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000
How long is your watch?

1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000
As long as it fucking takes.

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000
What's he doing?

1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.000
How can you listen to these
sappy love songs all day long?

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000
Reminds me of being 16
in the backseat of my car...

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000
with Marsha McConnell.

1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:12.000
Guy's got a car,
why's he taking the bus?

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.000
wherever he may go

1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000
an ocean too deep

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:30.000
it can keep me away

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:38.000
my hand I knew

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000
This is fucking comical.

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:46.000
We're running out of sand,
this guy's taking

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000
You run this place?

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000
Yeah. No connection.

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000
Whoa. Whoa.
-Ah, fuck!

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000
Hey, you all right?

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
I'm all right.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:10.000
Okay.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.000
Mm-hmm.

1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:16.000
We work the case.
That's all we can do,

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000
It's like fishing.

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:21.000
You can go days without a
strike, then all of a sudden,

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.000
I'm fucking dying here, Deke.

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:24.000
Okay. Why don't you go home,

1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.000
I'll put him to bed.

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.000
-Fuck you.
-There you go.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:30.000
That's what I expected.

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000
You think they got watch
batteries down there?

1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:53.000
Mm.

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:55.000
All right,
I'm gonna go down there.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.000
Black coffee.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:58.000
All right.

1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:10.000
-

1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:13.000
-Hello?
-Boo.

1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:17.000
Get your hands in the air!

1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000
-Now!
-Okay, okay.

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:20.000
Do it now! Up against the gate.

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:23.000
Move!

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.000
-Move!
- Okay.

1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:27.000
Is this right? This...

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:29.000
-Forward!
-Okay. Fine.

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.000
Hands on your head!

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:36.000
Interlace your fingers.

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.000
Excuse me?

1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.000
Interlace your fingers.

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.000
Oh. Um...

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:43.000
That sounds complicated. Mm.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000
Point your fingers to the sky.

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000
Now!

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.000
-Spread your legs.
-Thought you'd never ask.

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.000
-Where is she?
-Oh.

1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:03.000
The original.
How did you wrangle that,

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.000
Where is she?

1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000
You don't wanna know.

1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000
Not really.

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.000
Okay, okay.

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:24.000
Okay.

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000
You win.

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000
I'll take you to her.

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000
Would you like that?

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.000
Jeez.

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000
Are you coming?

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000
You got some serious
anger issues, Jimmy.

1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000
You almost cracked my rib.

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000
40, 50...

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000
60, 70...

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.000
Come on.

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000
I won't bite.

1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:28.000
Get in.
We've got a drive ahead of us.

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000
And I've gotta work tomorrow.

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.000
You already felt me up.
You're armed, I'm not.

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.000
What are you so scared of,
little boy?

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:50.000
Oh, PS, your buttbuddy's
not invited.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000
Buckle up.

1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000
Safety first.

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000
You know,
you're not very good company.

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000
Where exactly is it
we're going?

1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000
Ronda Rathbun?

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000
You know,
you and I are a lot alike.

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000
In another lifetime...

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000
uh, we could be friends.

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000
Isn't that crazy?

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.000
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:26.000
You mind?

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000
I knew a guy
who had a hunting lease here.

1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:57.000
And we got the moon tonight.

1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000
Cut the bullshit. Where is she?

1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.000
All business.

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000
You start walking that way.

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000
Hm.

1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000
I'm a man of my word, Jimmy.

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000
Chilly.

1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.000
Colder.

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:19.000
No, no. Cold.

1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:22.000
God, you're really terrible
at this, you know that?

1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000
Let me give you a hint.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.000
That way.

1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:29.000
Okay.

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:32.000
Uh-uh. Warm.

1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:33.000
Warmer.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000
Hot. Hotter.

1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:36.000
Hottest.

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000
Bingo.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000
Now look down at the ground
and say...

1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:49.000
"Hello, Ronda."

1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:02.000
You're gonna need this.

1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000
You dig.

1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000
The devil's
in the details, Jimmy.

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:13.000
Witnesses, physical evidence.

1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000
You'd have to get rid of
my body, get rid of my car.

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:17.000
It's a lot to consider.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:22.000
Besides...

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000
it's a peace offering.

1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:37.000
Okay.

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000
Oh, you're gonna kill me.

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.000
Uh...

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.000
Oh, poop.

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.000
I think I made a boo-boo.

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:25.000
Yeah. Come to think of it,
this doesn't look

1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000
But this one over here...

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000
this looks very promising.

1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:36.000
Yeah, that's it.

1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:37.000
What did you say?

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000
Um...

1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000
"Poop."

1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:45.000
Then,
"This one is more promising."

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:52.000
It's not like
I have a fucking treasure map.

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:05.000
I keep digging,
you keep talking.

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000
X marks the spot.

1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:37.000
Third time's the charm.

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000
It's like the cereal aisle.

1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000
You want the truth?

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000
I've never killed anybody
in my entire life.

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:07.000
If you believe me,
we can get in the car and

1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000
Maybe even stop for tacos.

1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:12.000
If not...

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000
-That's it.

1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000
Not too much longer now.

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:07.000
What are you, five, six deep,
and no end in sight?

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000
Oh...

1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:16.000
I forgot to tell you.

1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000
I've seen a picture
of your family.

1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:24.000
You should've stayed out
of the public eye, Jimmy.

1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:29.000
You and your ego.

1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:34.000
I mean, what kind of
a father are you?

1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000
How can you protect
those two beautiful daughters

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.000
when you can't even
begin to help one...

1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:44.000
of those poor girls
or their families?

1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000
You're insignificant.

1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:51.000
You don't matter.

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:56.000
And this will go on
and on and on.

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:22.000
Hey. Hey. Hey, get up.

1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:24.000
Get up, man.

1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000
Get up!

1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:32.000
Get up!

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:28.000
Deke, what is it?
- Quiet.

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:35.000
Oh.

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000
Oh, shit.

1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000
The past
becomes the future,

1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:44.000
becomes the future...

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:47.000
becomes the past,
becomes the future...

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000
becomes the future.

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000
It was him.

1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000
We got him. He was our boy.

1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000
He was our boy.
He as much as told me.

1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000
Nothing you can do
about it now.

1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:27.000
We gotta call somebody.

1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000
What am I gonna say?

1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000
What am I gonna do?

1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000
Nothing. You're not gonna say
anything, you're not gonna do

1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000
You're gonna find a hole,
stick him in it.

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:45.000
Pick one at least four feet
deep. I'll be back in a few

1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000
What'd she say, man?

1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000
What's up with homeboy
there?

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000
Hey.

1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000
He was our boy, Deke.
I'm sure he was our boy.

1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:12.000
Nobody's gonna give a damn.
I've taken care of it.

1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000
So, listen...

1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000
you go back,

1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:20.000
you tell Farris
that Sparma was a wash,

1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000
and that you need a break.

1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:27.000
A couple of weeks. You tell him
I left town Saturday,

1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.000
and you went home.

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000
Are you listening to me?

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000
He's dead.

1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000
He's forgotten.
He's rotting in the ground

1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:41.000
and the only way
he's gonna come back

1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000
Don't you ever go back to his
place,

1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:47.000
don't you ever let his name
cross your lips,

1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:50.000
don't you ever pull his file,
'cause if you do...

1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:54.000
he'll rise up out of that
ground. He'll do you in.

1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000
It's the little things, Jimmy.

1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000
It's the little things
that rip you apart,

1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000
it's the little things that...

1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000
get you caught.

1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000
That's my boy.

1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000
He was...

1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000
Joe...

1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000
Sí.

1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:12.000
And that
brings to an end

1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:15.000
Thanks for listening
for all these many years.

1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000
It's twelve o'clock.

1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000
Straight-up noon, LA.
This is Bobby Saunders,

1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000
and I'm saying welcome
to the new KHVY,

1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:25.000
the king of talk radio,
where what you have to say--

1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:40.000
A white male,
between the ages of 25 and 40.

1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:43.000
He's of above-average
intelligence and socially

1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000
Works as a skilled laborer.

1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000
Probably firstborn or an only
child.

1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000
And he follows the crimes in
the media.

1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000
He has at least one car
in good condition,

1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000
and he has a propensity
for changing jobs.

1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:59.000
Picking up,
leaving at a moment's notice.

1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:02.000
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is the guy we're looking for.

1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000
What about the leads we're
following?

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000
I think it's safe to say
we're at square one

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000
But I can promise you this.

1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000
We'll get the bastard.

1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:28.000
-Ana.
-Hey, Sal.

1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.000
Come in.

1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000
Thanks. I gotta get going.

1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:34.000
You okay?

1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000
We miss him already. Uh...

1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:43.000
Joe Deacon gave me this.

1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000
Said it was for Jimmy.

1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.000
Thanks.

1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.000
Take care.

1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000
You too.

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000
Thanks, Sal.

1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000
You know I love you, Dad.
But go away?

1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:03.000
You're always around
when I don't need you.

1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000
-

1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000
Sal brought this by.

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000
He said it was from Joe Deacon.

2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:07.000
Cause of death, multiple stab
wounds.

2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.000
That's what I'm putting down.
