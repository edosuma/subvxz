00:35.785 --> 00:36.786
Sir.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.039
-What?
-Nadeem escaped.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.290
He's in the wind.

00:42.751 --> 00:43.960
Then find him!

01:04.647 --> 01:05.982
Hello, Wilson.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.008
[Foggy] Okay. There's nobody watching.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.478
[Matt] Straight up there, please.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.606
Nice and easy. No rush.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.441
[Brett] Go.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.573
[Foggy] Thanks, Mrs. Mahoney.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.201
[Mrs. Mahoney] Y'all ain't the only ones
haunted by Wilson Fisk.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.204
Thank you, dear.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.502
Uh, fresh sheets on the bed.
Towels if you need.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.302
Uh... Thank you. Really.

02:17.428 --> 02:19.722
And don't worry. Nobody knows you're here.

02:25.603 --> 02:26.521
Seema, if you--

02:26.604 --> 02:29.274
You promised
you would never lie to me again.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.947
Seems, if you understood
what was going on here--

02:36.030 --> 02:38.241
Do you know why I married you, Ray?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.163
It wasn't your good looks
or my father's blessing.

02:43.913 --> 02:48.209
It was because I believed in my soul that
I had found a good man who would love me.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.254
And who would be
completely honest with me.

02:51.337 --> 02:52.630
Seems, I do love you...

02:52.714 --> 02:55.717
You lied again and again.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.179
And now here we are, running.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.723
Hiding in some lady's house.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.101
Fisk played me. Okay?
And before I knew it--

03:05.185 --> 03:07.187
You brought a gunfight to our home!

03:10.440 --> 03:11.524
You're right.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.736
About everything.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.116
But I will fix it.

03:21.618 --> 03:26.664
Sami was curled up with me in a bathtub,
waiting for men to come kill him.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.542
Do you know what I hoped for
in that moment?

03:29.626 --> 03:33.213
That they'd kill him first,
so he didn't have to watch me die.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.256
How do you fix that?

03:35.882 --> 03:37.759
Seems, Seems... [kissing hands]

03:40.053 --> 03:41.346
I am so sorry.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.018
But I will make you and Sami safe.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.146
I promise you.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.525
I can't let what you say
matter to me anymore, Rahul.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.780
Sami deserves at least one person
in his life he can trust.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.991
And that's never going to be you.

04:19.634 --> 04:22.887
Mahoney really stepped up for us.
Mrs. M, too.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.806
Everyone in the neighborhood
wants Fisk gone.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.892
Foggy, you don't need
to talk me into this anymore.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.061
I promised we'd do it your way,
and we are.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.896
Good. 'Cause it's gonna work.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.564
Good. I hope you're right.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.025
[door opens]

04:37.485 --> 04:38.653
Are we clear?

04:45.576 --> 04:46.869
[sighs] So, what now?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.708
You're going to testify against Fisk,
once you hire us to represent you.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.669
Represent me?

04:55.253 --> 04:57.547
As Nelson and Murdock, attorneys at law.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.802
[theme music playing] [classical music playing]

06:32.892 --> 06:35.853
Three restaurants,
the best spa in the city...

06:37.063 --> 06:40.775
a full staff waiting
to fulfill our every need,

06:40.858 --> 06:41.984
It's all ours.

06:42.944 --> 06:43.945
"Ours"? You bought it?

06:45.822 --> 06:46.823
For you.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.660
There's a penthouse
with the best view of the city.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.246
Our city.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.125
[sighs]

06:58.334 --> 07:00.086
It's everything you've ever wanted.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.967
[soft droning]

07:07.844 --> 07:09.303
[metal detector beeping]

07:19.480 --> 07:20.982
-Sir, uh...
-Not now.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.277
-It's important.
-Not now.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.031
[man] Good night.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.658
[soft droning]

07:50.261 --> 07:51.721
Can I get you something?

07:52.930 --> 07:54.056
Champagne?

07:56.934 --> 07:58.352
Not now, thank you.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.117
I don't have your eye...

08:15.912 --> 08:19.248
but I hung them
where I guessed you would like them.

08:20.082 --> 08:25.463
We can move them or...
buy other ones, whatever you like.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.346
I thought that you might
want to curate a collection

08:33.429 --> 08:35.890
and display it throughout the hotel.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.280
Thank you.

08:52.114 --> 08:53.699
This is all so generous.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.036
It's nothing.
I wanted you to feel welcome.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.037
I do.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.040
It's...

09:03.584 --> 09:04.835
incredible.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.965
Do you want something to eat
from one of the restaurants,

09:09.048 --> 09:10.883
or I could make you something?

09:10.967 --> 09:14.470
I'm not hungry... just tired.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.056
I'm sorry.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.976
You've gone through so much trouble.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.394
No, no. Please. I...

09:22.311 --> 09:25.064
You had a long trip. I should have...

09:25.606 --> 09:29.485
I should have realized
that this could be overwhelming.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.945
It's sweet...

09:31.529 --> 09:36.033
but all I want right now
is a hot bath and a soft bed.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.498
The master suite is upstairs.
I'll show you.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.624
No need.

09:44.792 --> 09:45.835
I'll find it.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.820
This is your law office?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.615
Nobody knows about this place.
We'll be safe here. Take a seat.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.872
Ms. Page. Agent Nadeem.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.296
You tried to warn me about Fisk.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.090
I should have listened.

10:34.258 --> 10:38.387
-And about what happened at the church--
-Let's not... Let's not go there.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.765
In the end, you got me out alive,

10:40.848 --> 10:43.142
so I guess that means
we're on the same side now.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.229
Yeah. I guess it does.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.524
All right. We're gonna get your family
safe, Ray, but we can't ask for WITSEC.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.444
If Fisk got to the Bureau,
he can get to the Marshals Service.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.531
We were thinking overseas.
Maybe with a friend or a distant relative.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.075
Uh...

10:59.158 --> 11:01.911
my brother's wife has a cousin in Bihar.

11:01.994 --> 11:04.997
-I never liked him.
-[Karen] Oh, I can get 'em a flight.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.916
But Fisk's people
will be watching the airports,

11:06.999 --> 11:08.459
so we should fly 'em out of Montreal.

11:11.545 --> 11:15.383
Um, I've had some time to think
about how to get away from him.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.386
[Ray] They'll be watching
my bank accounts.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.428
We'll cover it.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.184
Thanks.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.688
But it might be more than I deserve.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.403
Look, you... you hurt people.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.572
It doesn't have to define you.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.911
You should get ready, Ray.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.871
Locker room is through there.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.458
Yeah.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.930
You're right.
His mistakes don't need to define him.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.015
Neither do yours.

12:06.392 --> 12:07.309
[scoffs]

12:08.144 --> 12:10.438
I should get going.
I don't wanna miss my window.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.027
Really?
No, uh, "It's too dangerous, Karen"?

12:17.111 --> 12:18.112
[chuckles]

12:19.363 --> 12:21.115
Clearly, you can handle yourself.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.832
[stammers] But, you know,
Karen, please, be careful.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.462
Got it.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.887
[police siren wails]

13:01.405 --> 13:02.656
Detective Mahoney.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.533
I see you're putting in
for early retirement.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.370
No, sir, Mr. District Attorney.
There's someone who needs to talk to you.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.956
Oh, hell.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.255
[Tower] You ever hear of a phone?

13:19.006 --> 13:21.842
I'm as familiar with my phone
as you are with the "ignore call" button.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.010
What do you want?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.846
Another viral video you can use
to campaign against me?

13:25.930 --> 13:28.766
I want to make you an offer
that you won't want to refuse.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.769
I can't wait.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.938
In exchange for an hour of your time,

13:34.021 --> 13:36.482
I'll drop out of the race
and hand you the election.

13:36.565 --> 13:38.317
-What's the punch line?
-No punch line.

13:38.400 --> 13:42.154
I'm just asking that you sit down with
Matt Murdock and me and a client of ours,

13:42.238 --> 13:44.824
and just listen to what he has to say.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.994
I do that, and you just drop out?

13:51.121 --> 13:52.081
Uh-huh.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.000
You know,
I don't even pick up a book in the airport

13:55.084 --> 13:56.710
without reading the last page first?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.296
I need to know what this meeting is about.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.006
[sighs]

14:01.882 --> 14:04.260
-It's about Wilson Fisk.
-For the love of...

14:04.885 --> 14:07.096
You need help, Nelson.
Get the hell out of my car.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.639
Fisk is threatening my family.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.434
He got them dirty, and now he's using them
as leverage against me.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.818
So if you win the election...

14:21.944 --> 14:25.614
and take my job,
Fisk will control New York's DA?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.492
Right.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.788
So, honestly, I'm dropping out whether
you give me an hour of your time or not.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.625
But I'm asking you to anyway.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.919
You'll withdraw publicly?

14:39.712 --> 14:40.880
And endorse you.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.466
Throw in an extra 15 minutes,
I'll even vote for you.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.097
[Matt] <i>You ready for this?</i>

14:50.681 --> 14:52.224
Testifying is not gonna be easy.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.645
I loved my job.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.107
And I loved being the good guy.

15:03.152 --> 15:05.446
I want to be
on the right side of the line again.

15:05.529 --> 15:06.363
[Matt chuckles]

15:07.907 --> 15:09.658
You didn't love it enough to stop Fisk.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.540
Fisk knows how to make people vulnerable.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.211
He got my sister-in-law's
health insurance canceled,

15:21.295 --> 15:23.547
left my family with bills to pay.
Bills that I had to--

15:23.631 --> 15:26.133
So you take a loan, you sell your house,
you figure it out.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.052
You don't allow yourself
to become an accessory.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.054
-It wasn't that easy--
-You backed his play, Ray.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.348
You moved him into his hotel,
even gave him his toys back.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.099
He was giving information
that saved lives.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.518
While he was taking lives.
While he was taking over the city!

15:36.602 --> 15:38.854
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you were my lawyer!

15:38.938 --> 15:42.232
I am your lawyer, but I can't help you if
you can't answer this one simple question.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.611
Why didn't you blow the whistle when you
watched your boss murder an agent?

15:46.570 --> 15:47.488
I don't know.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.323
Or when you saw Dex walk in that church?

15:49.406 --> 15:52.409
You didn't say a goddamn word
when he murdered a priest.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.036
-I don't know.
-Then why are we here?!

15:54.119 --> 15:55.996
Because I took the damn bait!

16:02.419 --> 16:07.257
Because I didn't want my son to see me
as just an average federal employee.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.597
I messed up.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.476
I destroyed my life.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.814
My family's life.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.154
And I would do anything
to take it all back again.

16:30.781 --> 16:31.782
Good.

16:32.324 --> 16:35.202
You tell that to the DA,
and I can help you.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.589
Blake Tower, FBI Special Agent Ray Nadeem.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.882
We've met.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.135
[Matt] Before we begin, some ground rules.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.054
Our client will speak to you
under terms of use immunity.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.015
He does not waive
his Fifth Amendment rights.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.768
Special Agent, I should advise you
that Misters Nelson and Murdock

16:59.852 --> 17:01.270
have their own agendas in this case.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.189
Conflicts of interest are not something
you want in legal counsel.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.610
I trust them. [Tower] Suit yourself.

17:11.071 --> 17:14.783
Mr. Nelson played his biggest
and last card to get me here.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.037
So, what are you going to tell me?

17:19.121 --> 17:21.790
He's going to tell you that Wilson Fisk
has had people murdered,

17:21.874 --> 17:23.917
blackmailed
federal law enforcement personnel,

17:24.001 --> 17:25.669
and is currently taxing
New York's criminals

17:25.753 --> 17:27.755
in exchange for protection
from prosecution.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.882
And your client
has personally witnessed these acts?

17:29.965 --> 17:32.426
He did. And he's prepared to testify.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.013
[Tower] Now, before I agree to that,

17:36.096 --> 17:38.974
Agent Nadeem,
why are you coming forward now?

17:43.562 --> 17:44.897
I hurt people.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.192
My pride hurt people.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.112
And I need to make that right again.

17:53.989 --> 17:54.990
Okay.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.369
I accept the terms of use immunity.

18:00.704 --> 18:01.955
Tell me what you know.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.881
[shudders]

18:14.009 --> 18:16.386
[door opens and closes]

18:25.896 --> 18:27.564
Can I get you anything else, sir?

18:32.694 --> 18:36.782
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
about Karen Page.

18:37.741 --> 18:41.036
She would be dead
if Agent Nadeem hadn't interfered.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.418
After everything you've done for me, I...

18:50.838 --> 18:53.549
I just wanted to tell you
that I'll keep my word.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.051
I will find her, and when I do,
I am going--

18:56.135 --> 18:57.344
No.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.222
This matter will be handled,
but not by you.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.392
-I can handle Agent Nadeem.
-Do nothing.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.230
It's clear that I have put
too great a burden on your shoulders.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.655
[soft droning]

19:21.994 --> 19:23.704
[Ray] <i>After the attack on my home...</i>

19:24.288 --> 19:27.875
I secured my family
and came directly here.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.255
-This is unbelievable.
-Believe it.

19:34.631 --> 19:37.968
I can convene a special grand jury today.
Probably by 4:00 p.m.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.803
Great. Our offer is straightforward.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.556
Agent Nadeem's testimony
in exchange for full immunity.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.647
He just confessed to being
an accessory in how many homicides?

19:50.731 --> 19:52.983
Cases you would never make
in a million years

19:53.066 --> 19:54.318
without our client's testimony.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.404
If this was a larceny case,
or corruption, maybe.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.991
But he's a federal law enforcement officer
that looked the other way

20:01.074 --> 20:03.702
while class A felonies,
homicides, were committed.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.872
Two men were murdered in front of him,
and he never said a damn word.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.249
He didn't say a thing,
because he was afraid for his family.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.876
Fisk tried to kill them all last night,

20:10.959 --> 20:13.879
and Agent Nadeem is here today,
telling you everything.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.256
Can you say
you'd do the same thing, Mr. Tower?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.676
Our offer expires
when you walk out that door.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.763
Full immunity, or we're advising
our client to run for his life.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.767
Five years.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.269
-On each count.
-No.

20:29.353 --> 20:33.023
-[Tower] You can't do murder and walk.
-[Foggy] Come on, Blake, no jail time.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.484
You'll be the DA
who took down Wilson Fisk,

20:35.567 --> 20:38.487
and the next stop on the Tower train
is the governorship.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.202
Five years, on all counts.

20:45.285 --> 20:46.370
Final offer.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.081
Thank you for coming by, Mr. Tower.

20:55.462 --> 20:56.463
Wait.

20:58.548 --> 20:59.633
He's right.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.969
I did the crime.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.849
And I need to keep my family safe.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.561
I'll take it.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.525
It's okay.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.486
I'm good with this.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.490
[Tower] Let me make a call.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.325
[door opens]

21:27.077 --> 21:27.911
[door closes]

21:28.495 --> 21:31.498
Sami, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

21:32.624 --> 21:38.130
You might hear some stories about me,
some stuff that...

21:39.423 --> 21:41.216
sounds like I did bad things.

21:44.761 --> 21:47.306
No, I didn't do them.

21:49.516 --> 21:51.893
But I didn't stop them
from happening, either.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.148
And that's just as bad.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.609
I was trying to keep
you and your mom safe.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.488
That's all that matters to me.

22:04.239 --> 22:07.034
I don't care what people say about me,

22:07.576 --> 22:12.622
all I care about is...
what you say about me,

22:13.582 --> 22:16.126
and that you get to live
the life that you want.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.961
I love you, kid.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.088
Hey. Feels good, right?

22:21.423 --> 22:23.425
What? Letting Ray serve five years?

22:23.508 --> 22:26.386
Any other lawyers,
he would've gone away a lot longer.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.640
But I meant working together, you and me.

22:30.724 --> 22:34.561
Doing what we're supposed to be doing
the way we're supposed to be doing it.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.272
Yeah... it felt good.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.607
Right?

22:38.690 --> 22:42.652
I miss this, working together,
giving a shit about my clients.

22:42.736 --> 22:46.073
Not just billing midtown jackholes
in six-minute increments.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.533
Those jackholes pay well, though, huh?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.202
What, are those new shoes?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.080
Seems like you
got used to the money, Nelson.

22:53.163 --> 22:54.581
So I'll get unused to it.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.291
We should do this again.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.335
Don't get ahead of yourself.
We're not there yet.

22:58.418 --> 22:59.628
But we're getting there.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.671
[sighs]

23:30.700 --> 23:31.701
Vanessa.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.497
I'm sorry, I overslept.
Long flights do me in.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.751
I heard the shower.
I thought you might be famished.

23:41.002 --> 23:43.171
-My favorite.
-Yes, I remember.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.425
[Vanessa chuckles]

23:53.890 --> 23:54.891
More salt?

23:55.475 --> 23:56.685
It's perfect.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.455
Vanessa, something's bothering you.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.417
Please tell me what it is.

24:25.422 --> 24:26.339
[sighs]

24:26.423 --> 24:29.843
While I was away, I was always surrounded
by your bodyguards.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.308
"How are you, Ms. Marianna?"

24:37.434 --> 24:39.686
"How is your day going, Ms. Marianna?"

24:40.437 --> 24:42.022
I was always "fine."

24:42.898 --> 24:46.401
The day was always "nice."

24:47.194 --> 24:52.491
One day, I, um, found myself
on the Nervión River in Bilbao.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.743
Hundreds of people...

24:55.994 --> 24:58.955
Tourists posed for pictures, held hands...

25:00.707 --> 25:02.876
kissed on the riverfront.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.838
I was surrounded by people...

25:09.382 --> 25:11.176
but I wasn't with them.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.012
I was lonely.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.559
Vanessa, we have both been lonely.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.311
And I still am.

25:22.354 --> 25:29.277
I'm here, surrounded by your things,
your people, even you...

25:32.864 --> 25:35.450
but I still don't feel that I'm with you.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.121
What can I do?

25:40.872 --> 25:43.458
-I'll do anything. Please, tell me.
-[door opens]

25:43.542 --> 25:44.626
[Felix clears throat]

25:47.128 --> 25:51.841
I am sorry to bother you, sir,
but I'm afraid this cannot wait.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.052
Not here.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.392
I have to...

26:04.896 --> 26:06.189
Forgive me, please.

26:07.357 --> 26:08.525
[Vanessa] Of course.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.413
[Fisk] <i>Never in front of Vanessa.</i>

26:23.498 --> 26:24.624
Tell me.

26:24.708 --> 26:28.211
Agent Nadeem has not yet been located.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.796
But my source tells me

26:29.879 --> 26:33.717
that the state's grand jury
that was to be released this morning

26:33.800 --> 26:35.260
has been held late.

26:35.343 --> 26:39.848
What's more, courthouse security
has been dramatically increased.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.558
These could be indications--

26:41.641 --> 26:43.810
Nadeem is intending to testify.

26:46.730 --> 26:48.398
That could be problematic.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.442
Yes, it would, sir.

26:50.525 --> 26:54.195
What's unclear to me
is how you failed to kill him!

26:55.113 --> 26:57.782
Daredevil interfered.

26:58.783 --> 27:01.202
The men responsible have been eliminated.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.498
However, the ultimate responsibility
does rest with me.

27:06.041 --> 27:10.462
If you would like my resignation,
I understand.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.052
You protected her...

27:19.387 --> 27:20.764
two years.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.352
You kept Vanessa safe when I couldn't.

27:27.187 --> 27:29.981
No, Felix. I want you to finish the job.

27:34.653 --> 27:39.032
If you need assistance, call our friends.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.581
Do whatever it takes.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.168
I will not be indicted.

27:52.545 --> 27:54.255
Hey, Tommy, I'll have two--

27:54.339 --> 27:57.425
Two knishes with extra sauerkraut
and extra mustard.

27:59.803 --> 28:01.054
It's 11:40. You're a creature of habit.

28:06.935 --> 28:07.769
[chuckles]

28:09.938 --> 28:12.232
This totally doesn't mean
that I forgive you, by the way.

28:12.315 --> 28:14.109
-I'm trying to keep a low profile.
-I'm sorry.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.069
You-know-who's people
are looking for me, so...

28:16.152 --> 28:17.696
Well, after what happened
at the church,

28:17.779 --> 28:20.198
so is every FBI agent
and reporter in the city.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.951
Uh, your knishes?

28:23.576 --> 28:24.953
Oh! Uh, here.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.084
So, um... are we doing this?

28:32.001 --> 28:36.214
If by "this" you mean
I tell you who Daredevil is, then no.

28:37.132 --> 28:40.677
What I can tell you is who attacked
the <i>Bulletin</i> in Daredevil's suit.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.845
Do you have a name?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.847
Ben Poindexter.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.141
The FBI agent who saved Fisk.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.226
Yeah, well,
apparently he made a good impression,

28:48.309 --> 28:49.602
because he's working for him now.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.105
-And you can prove this how?
-I don't have to.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.482
In a couple of hours,
the head of Fisk's FBI detail

28:54.566 --> 28:57.152
is going to testify to everything
in front of a grand jury.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.362
Ray Nadeem
is going to turn state's witness.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.365
-Wow.
-Yeah.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.409
It's a hell of an exclusive. Welcome back.

29:04.492 --> 29:07.454
No, see, actually,
it's not gonna be an exclusive.

29:08.663 --> 29:12.041
Come on, Ellison, this is...
This is bigger than just our newspaper.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.170
When Fisk had our offices attacked,
he was trying to silence the truth.

29:18.506 --> 29:19.716
God help me.

29:19.799 --> 29:20.967
-[Karen sighs]
-[clears throat]

29:21.050 --> 29:24.053
Okay, so what is it, exactly,
that you want me to do?

29:24.137 --> 29:26.139
I need you to call a press conference.

29:26.806 --> 29:31.728
Just tell everyone
that Karen Page wants to make a statement.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.662
This is from Wilson.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.542
I was wondering where it had gone.

29:55.335 --> 29:57.253
Hey, we haven't formally met yet.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.173
I'm Agent Poindexter.

30:00.715 --> 30:01.716
Dex.

30:02.383 --> 30:07.972
If you need anything at all,
just think of me as the new James Wesley.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.974
Pleasure to meet you.

30:10.517 --> 30:11.851
Vanessa Marianna.

30:16.356 --> 30:17.482
[Vanessa sighs]

30:17.565 --> 30:21.236
I've always told Wilson
he has great taste in art.

30:24.322 --> 30:26.991
He does love to put
beautiful things on display.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.995
Where did you find it?

30:31.621 --> 30:35.291
Some lady had it.
Wilson couldn't get her to sell it.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.920
Well, that must have been
very disappointing for him.

30:39.921 --> 30:43.049
It's the painting in his collection
that means the most to us.

30:43.967 --> 30:45.301
I figured that...

30:45.885 --> 30:49.097
so I thought I'd ask her
just one last time.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.527
Thank you, Agent Poindexter.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.656
Perhaps you can arrange
to have it hung for us?

31:09.742 --> 31:11.494
It'd be my pleasure, ma'am.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.039
[Ray] What about Nelson?

31:15.623 --> 31:17.792
Foggy's ironing out some details
with the DA.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.669
He's gonna meet us at the courthouse.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.297
-Then let's get this over with.
-Not that one. This one.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.550
[Ray] Really? [Matt] Hey.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.473
Mahoney tell you this could get rough?

31:33.099 --> 31:35.602
He told me you're taking out Fisk.
That's all I need to hear.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.478
Courthouse. No stops.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.162
[sirens wailing]

32:02.545 --> 32:04.088
I need to ask you something.

32:07.675 --> 32:10.219
You want to know about Daredevil. [sighs]

32:12.305 --> 32:17.560
I stepped off the path for a few weeks,
and it destroyed my life...

32:19.145 --> 32:23.149
But your life,
you step on and off all the time.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.820
It complicates my life, too.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.950
-Trying to have it both ways.
-Does it?

32:32.033 --> 32:35.244
I mean, your friends know who you are,
what you do.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.913
My life almost got them killed.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.748
And not for the first time.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.210
I don't see how I can have it both ways.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.754
But you already do.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.968
I messed up,
and no matter what happens today...

32:51.427 --> 32:53.888
I don't know
if my wife's ever coming back.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.267
But your friends keep coming back.

32:59.143 --> 33:01.396
I mean, how do you hold onto them?

33:05.650 --> 33:06.776
It's not me.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.404
It's them.

33:12.323 --> 33:13.866
[vehicles honking]

33:21.958 --> 33:24.002
[indistinct chatter]

33:26.254 --> 33:28.006
[horn honking]

33:30.008 --> 33:31.050
[man 1] Light it up.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.929
[automatic gunfire]

33:35.013 --> 33:36.222
[screaming]

33:41.185 --> 33:43.104
[driver gasping]

33:43.187 --> 33:44.897
[Ray] Get us out of here!

33:44.981 --> 33:46.274
He's dead.

33:46.899 --> 33:47.984
Draw your weapon.

33:49.318 --> 33:50.778
There's a guy there.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.030
I can't shoot blind. Anybody--

33:52.113 --> 33:54.157
They're reloading, Ray! Fire your weapon!

33:55.116 --> 33:56.034
[man 2 grunting] There.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.871
-[man 3 grunting]
-Through there.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.707
-You got him.
-Let's go.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.792
Wait! Ray! Wait!

34:11.674 --> 34:12.717
[grunting] Clear!

34:24.854 --> 34:26.939
-We stick together. Understand?
-I know what I'm doing.

34:27.023 --> 34:29.317
-I'll get us to the courthouse.
-Stop, Ray. Listen to me.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.359
You need to trust me.

34:30.443 --> 34:33.029
You pretend to lead me,
but you do what I say.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.824
Stay down.
All right, there's two ahead of us.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.792
-[keys rattling]
-[alert beeping]

34:45.875 --> 34:48.920
[panting] All right. Up ahead,
there's a way out. This way.

34:52.799 --> 34:53.966
Two o'clock. Go.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.105
-[pop music playing over car stereo]
-[woman gasping]

35:16.322 --> 35:20.118
[men speaking indistinctly]

35:21.202 --> 35:22.912
Bus. Take the bus.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.497
Wait.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.584
-[men continue indistinctly]
-Okay, go.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.007
Sit down. Wait for my cue.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.098
Hello?

35:42.181 --> 35:45.059
Hello? What's... what's happening?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.271
Hello?

35:48.938 --> 35:50.439
Hello? Is anybody there? Hey-- [grunts]

35:58.364 --> 35:59.448
[Ray grunting]

36:16.674 --> 36:17.717
[grunting]

36:24.807 --> 36:27.435
-Let's go. It's just up ahead.
-[panting]

36:30.479 --> 36:32.565
Oh, shit. It's a cab.

36:32.648 --> 36:33.941
I think I should drive.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.401
[alert beeping]

36:38.613 --> 36:40.198
[car engine starting]

36:46.996 --> 36:48.122
[Karen panting]

36:48.206 --> 36:49.624
Hey. Where are they?

36:49.707 --> 36:51.584
-Late. Why?
-There's been an attack.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.169
People got shot a few blocks from here.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.504
-Oh, shit.
-They're locking down the building.

36:55.588 --> 36:58.424
-I need to call my office.
-Hey. We're here.

36:58.925 --> 37:02.345
-[Tower] What the hell happened?
-Fisk knows he's going to testify.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.013
-Are you in any condition to?
-[panting]

37:04.096 --> 37:06.349
-Absolutely, yeah.
-Okay. Let's go.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.184
Okay, here's the deal.

37:08.267 --> 37:11.354
After you testify, Tower will take you
for arraignment, then we'll bail you out.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.271
What about my family?

37:12.355 --> 37:14.857
Spoke with Seema. They'll be on
a flight to Delhi in the morning.

37:14.941 --> 37:18.444
It's not forever. Just until we get Fisk
put away. And you'll get to say goodbye.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.280
-I don't know how to thank you--
-Don't. Just go get Fisk.

37:28.454 --> 37:31.290
-You all set?
-Yeah, Ellison really delivered.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.792
Is it just me, or did our plan--

37:32.875 --> 37:35.419
-Foggy, I'm begging you, don't say it.
-But it feels good, right?

37:35.503 --> 37:38.589
The three of us working together
and saving the... Okay.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.424
Look, I gotta go, okay?

37:42.927 --> 37:43.928
[Matt] Oh, man.

37:45.012 --> 37:46.222
[exhales sharply]

37:49.475 --> 37:51.519
[bailiff] You do affirm that
all the testimony

37:51.602 --> 37:54.105
that you are about to give
in the case now before the court

37:54.188 --> 37:56.941
will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

37:57.608 --> 38:00.861
This you do affirm under the pains
and penalties of perjury?

38:07.994 --> 38:08.995
I do.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.961
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:17.545 --> 38:18.713
You ready for this?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.590
Uh, no. [breathes deeply]

38:21.674 --> 38:23.050
Okay, come on. Let's go.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.435
Hi, I'm Karen Page.
I'm here to make a statement.

38:32.518 --> 38:34.478
-Why didn't Daredevil kill you?
-Let her speak.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.105
We have all been lied to.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.524
All right? We've been manipulated

38:38.607 --> 38:40.901
by a sociopath
who doesn't care about the truth...

38:41.444 --> 38:44.405
or about who he hurts
or about anyone other than himself.

38:44.989 --> 38:49.952
Last night, Wilson Fisk tried to have me
killed because I know the truth.

38:55.041 --> 38:59.211
The man who was wearing the Daredevil suit
is not the real Daredevil.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.296
<i>He is an impostor</i>

39:00.379 --> 39:03.758
<i>who is helping Wilson Fisk take back</i>
<i>control of New York's criminal underworld.</i>

39:03.841 --> 39:05.843
<i>At this moment,</i>
<i>a grand jury is hearing testimony...</i>

39:05.926 --> 39:08.012
-You seeing this?
-[reporter 1] <i>...Fisk is involved?</i>

39:08.095 --> 39:10.723
[reporter 2] <i>Can you identify</i>
<i>this impostor? This fake Daredevil.</i>

39:10.806 --> 39:11.724
<i>Where did he come from?</i>

39:11.807 --> 39:14.560
[reporter 1] <i>Who's testifying</i>
<i>to the grand jury? Can you give us a name?</i>

39:19.982 --> 39:20.983
Okay.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.235
Your client was very convincing.

39:23.778 --> 39:25.529
Keep him here
until the indictment comes in.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.031
Don't worry. We'll hold up our end.

39:27.114 --> 39:30.034
-[Tower] Good. I'm counting on it.
-Thank you, sir.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.578
You okay?

39:34.246 --> 39:38.751
For a guy who's about to send
his family away and go to prison? [sighs]

39:38.834 --> 39:39.835
Yeah, I guess so.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.670
You did good, Ray.

39:42.671 --> 39:45.091
You heard everything through the wall,
didn't you?

39:46.050 --> 39:47.760
You know that's kind of creepy?

39:47.843 --> 39:48.719
Oh, he knows.

39:49.261 --> 39:51.180
I heard a man standing up to Fisk.

39:51.847 --> 39:53.516
Your son will hear the same thing.

39:54.433 --> 39:55.976
And it'll mean a lot to him.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.355
I didn't know if we could
get this done today, but we did.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.439
No... you did.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.859
So, thank you.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.030
So, what now?

40:08.989 --> 40:12.660
Hopefully, you'll serve out your sentence
in a minimum security prison.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.495
-Can't be sure.
-[juror speaking indistinctly]

40:14.578 --> 40:15.996
Will I do the whole term?

40:16.497 --> 40:18.624
My guess is
you won't serve the whole five.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.168
Hopefully. Good behavior, you never know.

40:21.252 --> 40:26.465
[juror] Willie Young,
789 West 144th Street.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.262
Sara Torres, 612 East 78th Street.

40:31.345 --> 40:33.764
What the hell? That's my address.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.224
Holy shit.

40:35.307 --> 40:37.852
[juror] Tom McGuinness, 707 Lovell Ave.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.772
I'm sorry, they made me memorize them.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.400
[Foggy] So just take it day by day.
That's all you can...

40:44.483 --> 40:46.235
Oh, no.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.196
-Matt? What's wrong?
-[exhales sharply]

40:50.614 --> 40:51.740
The jurors.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.493
Fisk got to them.

40:56.036 --> 40:59.999
<i>At this time, the grand jury</i>
<i>has elected not to indict Wilson Fisk,</i>

41:00.082 --> 41:03.002
<i>but this office, under my leadership,</i>
<i>will pursue every lead,</i>

41:03.085 --> 41:06.172
<i>every piece of evidence that leads us</i>
<i>to uncovering the truth,</i>

41:06.255 --> 41:07.465
<i>wherever we may find it.</i>

41:07.548 --> 41:09.967
[news anchor] <i>We'll continue to cover</i>
<i>this breaking news story</i>

41:10.050 --> 41:11.343
<i>as events unfold.</i>

41:11.427 --> 41:13.846
Karen Page,
this all started with you, didn't it?

41:13.929 --> 41:15.306
"Started"? What do you mean?

41:15.389 --> 41:18.142
You leaked the grand jury story,
and it was all a lie.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.185
No, it's not a lie.

41:19.268 --> 41:22.021
Is it a desperate attempt to boost
readership for the failing<i> Bulletin?</i>

41:22.104 --> 41:23.981
Screw you, Jerry.
What's Fisk paying you, anyway?

41:24.064 --> 41:25.691
-Get out of here.
-[reporters clamoring]

41:25.774 --> 41:27.151
[Ray vomiting]

41:28.194 --> 41:30.070
[Matt] It's not gonna end this way, Ray.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.823
We're not gonna let it.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.366
The system will work.

41:34.450 --> 41:35.451
[scoffs]

41:35.534 --> 41:36.744
You still believe that?

41:36.827 --> 41:39.330
We've been here before. We can fix this.

41:39.413 --> 41:42.291
Tower will impanel another grand jury
and try again.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.710
We're not done here. Right, Matt?

41:45.294 --> 41:46.712
I told you this would happen.

41:46.795 --> 41:48.881
-I need to know where you're going.
-Gonna find Tower.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.591
Make sure he tries again.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.219
-Right. Good.
-[door opens]

41:53.302 --> 41:54.887
-[water running]
-[door closes]

41:54.970 --> 41:55.888
[Ray sighs]

41:55.971 --> 41:58.098
When he gets back,
we'll get you someplace safe.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.600
[panting]

42:00.518 --> 42:01.977
Fisk is unstoppable.

42:03.187 --> 42:05.314
My family's never going to be safe.

42:05.397 --> 42:06.982
Don't talk like that, Ray.

42:07.566 --> 42:08.651
I'm sorry.

42:13.572 --> 42:14.573
[Ray] No...

42:15.741 --> 42:16.909
I'm sorry.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.965
How did this get here?

42:31.966 --> 42:35.010
A gift from Agent Poindexter.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.054
He persuaded the owner to part with it.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.100
Did he?

42:45.145 --> 42:48.315
I intended for the painting
to remain with her.

42:51.485 --> 42:55.322
He said to think of him
as the new James Wesley.

42:58.701 --> 42:59.952
-Is he?
-No.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.290
But he is useful.

43:12.339 --> 43:13.632
[Vanessa] Is he dangerous?

43:14.758 --> 43:16.677
Nothing to be concerned about.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.055
I'll handle it. How?

43:21.223 --> 43:22.891
-It's not important.
-It is to me.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.896
I think it's time we speak plainly.

43:28.522 --> 43:29.523
Speak honestly.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.151
I'm always honest with you.

43:33.152 --> 43:37.156
When I first met you,
I was fascinated by your strength.

43:38.449 --> 43:43.412
Your brutality so clear to me,
even as you hid it from me.

43:44.330 --> 43:48.042
I wanted to observe everything you did.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.169
And as I did, I fell in love with you.

43:51.754 --> 43:52.963
But this?

43:54.757 --> 43:56.675
If this is all we have...

43:57.718 --> 44:00.012
it will leave me lonely, Wilson. As lonely as I was in Spain.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.686
When you stopped your man
from speaking in front of me, I...

44:08.270 --> 44:12.024
I was reminded
that I am not a part of your life.

44:14.526 --> 44:17.321
Not fully, and so not at all.

44:19.448 --> 44:20.574
And this...

44:22.951 --> 44:25.996
I don't want to admire your world.

44:27.206 --> 44:30.834
I want to live inside of it with you.

44:31.418 --> 44:35.714
Vanessa, it's one thing to know my work,

44:36.757 --> 44:38.425
but it's another...

44:40.552 --> 44:42.221
to dirty your hands with it.

44:42.304 --> 44:45.140
My hands were never clean.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.935
If you truly want me...

44:49.645 --> 44:51.480
share your life with me.

44:52.398 --> 44:53.816
Fully.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.751
Come with me, please.

46:35.167 --> 46:36.335
Hey, beautiful. It's me.

46:38.754 --> 46:39.797
I'm home.

46:45.761 --> 46:47.429
You remember our wedding vows?

46:51.266 --> 46:53.268
"I love you more than life itself."

46:55.479 --> 46:56.605
I still do.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.985
And, Sami, your name means "elevated."

47:03.403 --> 47:05.280
And that's what you did for me.

47:05.989 --> 47:09.952
Made my life better
in the most unexpected ways.

47:12.371 --> 47:13.914
Elevate your mom now.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.815
You're watching everyone.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.110
Everyone I need to.

48:00.168 --> 48:02.129
An update, please, Mr. Manning.

48:02.212 --> 48:04.882
And speak freely.

48:07.175 --> 48:09.761
I will no longer
keep anything from Vanessa.

48:09.845 --> 48:11.138
Very good, sir.

48:11.972 --> 48:15.100
Agent Nadeem has been located.

48:15.183 --> 48:19.438
His testimony to the grand jury
remains sealed and inadmissible...

48:20.188 --> 48:21.899
but given its public nature,

48:21.982 --> 48:25.027
we should weigh the benefits
of keeping him alive.

48:25.110 --> 48:29.239
Force Nadeem to stand trial
for the murder of Agent Winn,

48:30.616 --> 48:34.244
turning the FBI against him
and discrediting him in the press.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.080
My thoughts exactly, sir.

48:38.916 --> 48:43.962
Wilson, what does Agent Nadeem
know about your business?

48:45.213 --> 48:47.549
A considerable amount.

48:47.633 --> 48:51.637
And is he determined to find ways
to hurt you? To hurt us?

48:54.640 --> 48:55.933
Yes.

48:56.808 --> 48:59.645
Don't you think it would be safer
to remove the threat?

49:03.065 --> 49:04.191
Yes, I do.

49:08.236 --> 49:13.533
If Agent Poindexter is useful,
perhaps he can help us with this problem.

49:17.287 --> 49:20.290
-You'll let him know, won't you?
-[Felix] Yes, ma'am.

49:57.911 --> 49:59.246
I hoped it'd be you.

50:00.831 --> 50:01.832
Hi, Ray.

50:05.585 --> 50:07.295
Come on inside. Let's talk.

50:09.548 --> 50:13.760
Come on, Dex. We both know
you're a better liar than that.

50:15.387 --> 50:16.805
You want a private place to kill me.

50:18.765 --> 50:21.768
You're in a tough spot, Ray. I get that.

50:23.228 --> 50:26.064
It sounds hard. Really hard.

50:27.858 --> 50:31.445
When he's done with you,
he'll bury you, too.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.282
You know that, right?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.409
I'm doing fine.

50:38.535 --> 50:41.204
And you would be, too,
if you hadn't opened your mouth.

50:43.790 --> 50:45.876
It's not too late
to turn things around, Dex.

50:47.794 --> 50:53.800
Fisk manipulated you, just like he did me
and Tammy and everyone else.

50:55.469 --> 50:57.429
I can help you cut a deal with the DA.

50:58.638 --> 51:01.683
We can take him down, you and me.

51:01.767 --> 51:06.313
Two federal agents... like we were before.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.191
[scoffs]

51:10.400 --> 51:12.319
No, that's not gonna happen, Ray.

51:13.570 --> 51:15.197
I'm more than a fed now.

51:16.114 --> 51:19.201
I feel more myself
than I have in my whole life.

51:20.202 --> 51:21.661
Fisk gave me that.

51:30.378 --> 51:34.132
As long as I'm alive, my family's at risk.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.431
Let's go, Ray.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.727
I'm not going anywhere with you, Dex.

51:47.771 --> 51:52.692
[sighs] Whatever you need to do...
you do it here.

51:55.487 --> 51:56.530
[gunshot]

51:58.448 --> 51:59.950
[dogs barking]
