[laughs]

00:49.583 --> 00:52.953
[music playing]

00:55.556 --> 00:57.425
OK, we bet $50,000.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.426
Hmm, I call.

00:58.526 --> 00:59.560
It's not your teacher, Mom.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.730
I know, but it's my house.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.265
We gonna play poker
or shoot the breeze?

01:04.365 --> 01:05.466
Shoot the breeze.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.235
OK.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.670
Porkchester game, last
game of my senior year.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.871
[groaning] We're
down by a touchdown

01:10.971 --> 01:12.740
with one minute to go--
- Let's play poker.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.007
Now we got to
shoot the breeze.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.709
I get to tell this story.
- Dad, we know this story.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.211
Yeah, well, this time I'm
telling it for the referee's

01:17.311 --> 01:18.912
point of view.
- I got a pair.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.181
So do I.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.317
Yeah but Roseanne's
are showin'.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.254
You guys think we don't get
your corny little sex jokes.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.357
Hey, you kids are our
corny little sex joke.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.328
[doorbell rings]

01:34.428 --> 01:35.229
Cheese it!

01:35.329 --> 01:36.230
The fuzz!

01:36.330 --> 01:38.966
Hide the cards and the chips.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.634
Darlene, I think it's
high time we taught

01:40.734 --> 01:42.536
DJ how to play 52 card pickup.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.506
Ha ha ha.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.507
[roseanne gasps]

01:46.607 --> 01:48.075
Tada!

01:48.176 --> 01:48.976
Hey!

01:49.076 --> 01:49.943
Dad!

01:50.043 --> 01:51.279
What are you doin' here?

01:51.379 --> 01:53.314
I came to see my
sweet little Kapushka.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.215
DAN: Al!

01:54.315 --> 01:56.016
Hey Danny.

01:56.116 --> 01:56.917
Dad!

01:57.017 --> 01:59.353
Oh my god!

01:59.453 --> 02:00.521
Is everything OK?

02:00.621 --> 02:01.522
Fine, fine.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.425
Where's Grandma?

02:04.525 --> 02:05.893
There she is now.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.361
Hello!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.297
Mom!

02:09.397 --> 02:10.731
Mom!

02:10.831 --> 02:12.700
Hi!

02:12.800 --> 02:15.035
What are you guys
doing in Lanford?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.338
Well, we got up this morning
and I said to your mother,

02:17.438 --> 02:18.472
what do you want to do?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.341
And, as usual, she had
no opinion, so I said,

02:20.441 --> 02:22.310
let's go for a little ride.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.179
250 miles isn't
a little drive.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.080
Especially when you have
a woman sitting next to you

02:27.181 --> 02:29.082
who whenever you
pass a car she says,

02:29.183 --> 02:30.684
I wonder where they going.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.785
Boy, she's got problems.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.624
Ma, why didn't you call?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.726
I did, but your line was busy.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.961
Then I tried your sister, I
couldn't get a hold of her

02:41.061 --> 02:43.197
I thought maybe something
was wrong but, of course,

02:43.297 --> 02:46.066
if there were God knows
she would never tell me.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.569
My apartment was getting
fumigated, Mom, so--

02:48.669 --> 02:50.170
Fumigated for what?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.705
All those louses
you go out with?

02:55.142 --> 02:58.379
[music playing]

03:01.849 --> 03:03.150
Let me see if I
got this straight.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.218
We need milk.
- Milk.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.286
- We need eggs.
- Eggs.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.186
Bullets.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.659
Come on, Dan, let's just
try to get through this.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.863
What are you doing up?

03:15.963 --> 03:17.164
I can't sleep.

03:17.265 --> 03:20.668
Grandpa is in the bathroom
making those gagging noise.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.436
Ewww.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.004
How long has he been in there?

03:24.104 --> 03:25.773
At least a half an hour.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.577
Well, he's probably
got it all up by now.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.712
Why don't you go back to bed.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.114
Mom, he's really
driving me crazy.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.186
If he says, pull my
finger, one more time--

03:39.287 --> 03:44.358
Well, now you know where I
get my smart, sophisticated wit.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.027
I can't believe
that man raised you.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.897
Now you know why I was so
crazy to marry you so young.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.565
I thought it was because
you were madly in love.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.801
Yeah, with the idea of
getting out of my house.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.207
Is there a place
in here to sit down?

04:00.308 --> 04:03.711
Yeah, why don't you try one
of these things we call chairs.

04:03.811 --> 04:07.648
We sit in them frequently.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.049
What kind of
list is he making?

04:09.149 --> 04:10.351
Not that it's any
of my business.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.251
A hit list.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.158
He's just gonna go out to the
store and pick up a few things.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.461
Please don't get
anything special for me.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.496
I'll eat whatever you have,
but your father's diet

04:22.596 --> 04:26.500
is low sodium, low
fat, and high fiber.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.369
So why don't we just get
him some wood, you know?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.037
And then he can
put mustard on it

04:30.137 --> 04:32.005
and it'd, you know,
that'd be a good treat.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.507
Mustard is high in fat.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.609
A lot of people don't know that.

04:35.709 --> 04:38.111
A lot of people don't care.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.813
I do, but doggone-it
I got to go.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.288
He's not working is he?

04:48.389 --> 04:49.523
He's working.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.225
Well, I'm glad because
your father worries--

04:52.326 --> 04:53.327
especially about your sister.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.898
He doesn't have to worry.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.299
Well, somebody has to.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.835
She's 32, she's unmarried.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.204
Heaven forbid that she turns
out to be like your Aunt

05:04.304 --> 05:07.808
Dale who teaches PE.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.910
Speaking of Aunt Dale,
how is Uncle Charlie?

05:14.415 --> 05:17.651
Also your father is
concerned because your sister

05:17.751 --> 05:20.854
lives in a building that
needs to be fumigated.

05:20.954 --> 05:25.493
But I am her mother, it is not
my job to tell her what to do.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.128
Oh, I get it, but
it is your job to tell

05:28.228 --> 05:30.464
me to tell her what to do.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.300
Yes I'm sure petunia's
are perennials.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.710
Jackie, Mom was just
talking about you.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.878
Now you get to listen
while she talks about me.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.919
So, we gonna talk
about Roseanne?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.120
Certainly not.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.988
It's just that your father
is worried about her.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.491
She seems so tired all the time.

05:57.591 --> 06:02.029
Mom, you've been here a
grand total of one hour.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.264
How do you know
how tired she is?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.034
A mother knows.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.503
Granted, it is a
different generation,

06:09.603 --> 06:11.539
but your father would
have died before he

06:11.639 --> 06:13.507
made me go out to work.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.709
Dan doesn't make
Roseanne work.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.712
That's what she tells you,
but you've never been married

06:18.812 --> 06:22.015
you don't know these things.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.584
What did you
find out about me?

06:23.684 --> 06:26.219
You're very tired.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.021
Hey, Ma, is two
blankets enough?

06:28.121 --> 06:32.526
Two is fine if
that's all you have.

06:32.626 --> 06:33.561
No, I have more.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.828
How many would you like?

06:34.928 --> 06:36.464
What did your father say?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.699
He says he's going to be
sleeping out in the driveway

06:38.799 --> 06:41.334
naked.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.270
How many blankets
do you want, Ma?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.106
If you have two, two is fine.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.049
I am this close to the
edge, and if I go over

06:56.149 --> 06:57.985
I'm taking you with me.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.988
She does have a way
about her, doesn't she?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.523
Jeez, if she wants
to rag on your life

07:02.623 --> 07:04.124
why doesn't she just tell you?

07:04.224 --> 07:06.827
I'm getting so sick of these
behind the back conversations.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.030
You mean like the one we're
having about Mom right now?

07:10.130 --> 07:10.931
Yeah.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.633
Yeah.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.934
I mean why should
I have to defend

07:14.034 --> 07:16.336
the guys you go out with?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.138
You shouldn't.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.940
And I'm tired of
explaining to her

07:20.040 --> 07:21.875
why your house is so
filthy all the time.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.413
Yeah, that's my business.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.314
Yeah,

07:27.414 --> 07:29.082
She just doesn't let up.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.318
Well, she's going to let up
because I'm gonna lay into her.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.086
Well, I'm going
to lay into her too.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.322
That woman's not qualified
to judge anybody's life.

07:35.422 --> 07:36.724
Where is she?
- Mom?

07:36.824 --> 07:37.991
Enough is enough already.

07:38.091 --> 07:38.959
We've got to do this.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.327
Absolutely.

07:40.427 --> 07:44.297
I found this under
your sister's sofa.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.899
Mom, why are you
giving it to me?

07:45.999 --> 07:49.603
It's her potato chip, it's
her sofa, it's her house.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.404
If you don't like the way
that Roseanne keeps house

07:51.505 --> 07:54.174
then you talk to Roseanne
about it you don't talk to me.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.375
And if you don't
like the way that I

07:55.475 --> 07:57.678
run my life then you
talk to me about it

07:57.778 --> 07:59.312
you don't talk to Roseanne.

07:59.412 --> 08:04.084
We're-- we're sick and tired of
the way that you manipulate us.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.352
Is that so, Roseanne?

08:09.957 --> 08:10.758
Yeah.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.026
Right?

08:13.126 --> 08:17.598
Well, maybe manipulate is kind
of a harsh word to use here.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.733
Just think what Jackie means.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.069
What she's trying to say is
that we wish that you would just

08:22.169 --> 08:26.006
try to deal with us in a
more direct manner, you know,

08:26.106 --> 08:27.107
if you want to.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.276
No, that's not what
Jackie is trying to say.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.178
What Jackie is trying
to say-- where the hell

08:31.278 --> 08:33.981
were you five minutes ago?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.617
I'll get some sheets, Mom.

08:36.717 --> 08:41.154
You really should turn
your mattress more often.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.056
Uh, where are
you going to sleep?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.158
Anywhere is OK with me.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.028
Hey, I don't sleep anywhere.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.063
Al, these-- these
cots are pretty nice.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.833
Oh, I'm sure Mom and Dad
don't want to sleep on any cots.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.301
Why did we do last time?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.403
Last time?

08:56.503 --> 08:58.305
I've completely blocked
it out of my mind.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.944
You guys don't mind
sleeping on cots, do ya?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.679
I can sleep anywhere.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.981
Why don't you and Dad
just take me and Dan's bed

09:08.081 --> 09:09.416
and we'll sleep out
here on the cot.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.018
Honey, I can't
sleep on these things.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.587
Last time Darlene and I
slept downstairs on the cots,

09:13.687 --> 09:15.789
and Grandma and Grandpa
slept up in our room.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.591
I want to sleep
on a sleeping bag.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.559
Gaw, that's not
what we did last year.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.528
Well, I'm very particular
about where I sleep.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.429
What does that mean?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.935
I'll tell you
something about me.

09:28.035 --> 09:32.105
I'll never sleep in
a communist country.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.074
I'll visit one during
the day, but I'll

09:34.174 --> 09:36.176
never sleep in one at night.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.511
Well, God bless America.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.947
Can I sleep in
your sleeping bag?

09:40.047 --> 09:40.848
No.

09:40.948 --> 09:41.749
Go.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.150
How 'bout what I said?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.051
What did you say?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.385
Forget what she said.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.120
Please let's not
fuss about this.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.189
Dad and I can sleep anywhere.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.958
Darlene and I
slept on the cots,

09:51.058 --> 09:52.660
and Grandma and
Grandpa had our room.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.261
These cots still
smell from where

09:54.361 --> 09:56.429
we found the dead pigeon in it.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.865
Darlene.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.567
OK, DJ and I must of
both slept on the floor.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.035
Mom and Dad had DJ's bed.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.071
But then that couldn't have been
because DJ's bed's too small

10:04.171 --> 10:06.139
and they would have
been uncomfortable.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.108
Jackie, you were
not even here.

10:08.208 --> 10:09.109
Temper, temper.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.511
Then how come I
can remember it?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.747
Because you have total
recall of all things imaginary.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.984
Girls, girls.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.886
Let's be ladies, shall we?

10:18.986 --> 10:20.688
Can we come to some
sort of conclusion here?

10:20.788 --> 10:21.922
OK, you want a conclusion?

10:22.022 --> 10:22.990
I'll give you a conclusion.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.425
OK, Jackie, you go
to sleep in DJ's bed.

10:25.525 --> 10:27.560
DJ, sleep in a sleeping bag.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.764
Girls, girls, girls, let's
just be little ladies

10:30.864 --> 10:33.100
and go up and sleep
in your own bed.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.768
Mom and Dad you take
me and Dan's room.

10:34.868 --> 10:35.736
Wait a minute.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.137
And I'm gonna sleep
here on the cot,

10:37.237 --> 10:40.307
and so is Mr. Flexible.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.744
Hopefully we won't have all
this confusion once your father

10:43.844 --> 10:47.080
and I have our own place
right here in Lanford.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.751
Sleep tight everyone!

10:50.851 --> 10:51.651
Nighty night.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.994
Dan, are you sleeping?

11:01.094 --> 11:01.895
Like a baby.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.466
The fact that it's
4:30 in the morning

11:06.566 --> 11:08.702
and I have a spring
in my pancreas

11:08.802 --> 11:12.605
isn't keeping me awake
the least little bit.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.441
If my parents
move to Lanford I

11:14.541 --> 11:17.277
am going to be sleeping on a
cot for the rest of my life

11:17.377 --> 11:21.749
because I'm going to be in
prison for blowing them away.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.517
Honey, honey, be realistic.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.419
You don't know how to use a gun.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.320
I'll do it.

11:31.158 --> 11:34.294
Seriously, Dan,
what are we gonna do?

11:34.394 --> 11:40.333
Well, I'd say let's sleep
on it, but who can sleep?

11:40.433 --> 11:43.270
You know, if you knew how
to stand up to your parents

11:43.370 --> 11:44.938
we wouldn't be lying
here right now.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.106
What is that supposed to mean?

11:46.206 --> 11:47.607
And I'm warning
you, that fireplace

11:47.707 --> 11:49.910
poker is within reach.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.813
Baby, let's not get
into this right now.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.849
Because it's not my warped,
psychotic, neurotic parents

11:55.949 --> 11:57.050
who are laying in my bed.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.488
I'm gonna go sit on the porch.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.456
Come on, honey.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
Honey, Let's not do
this to each other.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.660
Come on, baby, I'm sorry.

12:07.761 --> 12:10.697
I'm just angry because
I haven't slept.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.699
We've got a couple of
hours left till daylight,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.601
let's just try to
salvage some sleep.

12:41.929 --> 12:45.298
[loud snorting sounds]

12:48.836 --> 12:51.304
Al?

12:51.404 --> 12:52.205
Al?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.206
In here.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.742
Oh, you two go back to sleep.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.277
I'm just gonna make
your Father breakfast.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.211
He always gets up at 4:30.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.112
Why?

12:59.212 --> 13:00.013
I don't know.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.950
Go back to sleep.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.317
You feel like making love?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.428
Don't get up.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.731
I just want to know where
you keep your citrus fruit.

13:18.832 --> 13:19.933
I think there's
some strawberry

13:20.033 --> 13:22.870
Pop-tarts in the fridge.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.906
Your Father needs to have
a piece of citrus fruit.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.209
I think there's an
orange under the dryer.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.510
Go back to sleep.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.179
Dan shouldn't sleep
on his left side.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.914
It's bad for the heart.

13:34.014 --> 13:34.948
So is a rusty spike.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.419
This is nuts.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.922
This is nuts.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.157
I got a new job to start today.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.825
I've got to go to
work too, you know?

13:45.926 --> 13:46.927
Well, why don't
you go in there

13:47.027 --> 13:50.530
and tell Ma and Pa
kettle to shut up.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.932
What are you
doing up so early?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.506
[music playing]

14:02.009 --> 14:04.577
You know, this is the
best room in your house.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.047
Yeah, cause Mom
and Dad aren't in it.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.482
This is our only
sanctuary from them.

14:09.582 --> 14:10.817
Well, don't count on it.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.353
She'll figure out some
way to get in here.

14:13.453 --> 14:19.359
And then you can stand up to
her again like you did before.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.462
I said to your
grandmother, Beverly--

14:22.562 --> 14:25.999
I call her Beverly
because that's her name--

14:26.099 --> 14:29.036
I said, Beverly, this year
I'm gonna pay more attention

14:29.136 --> 14:31.004
to my stable and horses.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.206
You don't have
any horses, Grandpa.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.208
Because I don't have a stable.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.443
Pull my finger, kid.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.344
Don't.

14:40.447 --> 14:41.848
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

14:41.949 --> 14:45.152
Oh, I'm finished.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.120
Are you guys getting
ready for school?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.788
Yeah, and we're
really excited about it.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.358
That's great.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.293
They're really doing
great in school.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.829
Al was always very concerned
with the children's education.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.765
He was some father.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.568
What is it you
always used to say?

15:01.668 --> 15:05.973
You can lead a horse to water,
but you can't make him think.

15:09.209 --> 15:12.779
You used to say that?

15:12.879 --> 15:14.414
And you stopped saying that?

15:17.684 --> 15:22.689
He used to say that, and
he doesn't say it anymore.

15:22.789 --> 15:26.926
He used to say, you can
lead a horse to water,

15:27.027 --> 15:29.462
but you can't make him think.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.366
And he doesn't say it anymore.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.301
I haven't slept.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.610
I swear we're only
sane today because we

15:43.710 --> 15:44.911
kept for each other that way.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.280
I know, we protected
each other from Mr. and Ms.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.448
total insanity.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.417
Yeah, like that
time that you were

15:50.517 --> 15:53.886
in the eighth grade and you were
dating that 40-year-old guy.

15:53.987 --> 15:54.787
Huh?

15:54.887 --> 15:56.623
He was not 40.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.192
Oh, he was the only guy
at your freshman dance

15:59.292 --> 16:02.729
that was wearing a toupee.

16:02.829 --> 16:05.498
I told Mom he was your tutor.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.267
And I taught him
more than he taught me.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.303
Well, that's the way it goes.

16:10.403 --> 16:15.008
The bottom line is that Mom
and Dad are just so out there.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.978
Oh, you know, it's
not all their fault.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.014
We should just show them
a little compassion.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.982
Well, here we go again.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.752
Checking your
backbone at the door.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.087
Well, fine!

16:27.187 --> 16:28.455
Your blame your life and I'll--

16:28.555 --> 16:31.324
Oh, Roseanne, you turn into
a little robot every time Mom

16:31.424 --> 16:32.692
and Dad come around.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.496
You turn into a little, rosy
two-shoes and I'm sick of it.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.266
Hey, people who live in
cockroach infested apartments

16:39.366 --> 16:40.233
should not throw stones.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.534
Oh, I can't even talk to you!

16:41.634 --> 16:42.502
Oh, shut up!

16:42.602 --> 16:43.936
You always have
to get your own way.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.672
Hey, it has to be my way
when you're standing here

16:45.772 --> 16:47.507
in my bathroom at
7:30 in the morning

16:47.607 --> 16:49.542
after my parents
came over to my house

16:49.642 --> 16:51.544
and decimated my whole family!
- OK, now they're your parents!

16:51.644 --> 16:52.445
Fine!

16:52.545 --> 16:53.580
If you want them, fine!

16:53.680 --> 16:54.881
You have them!

16:54.981 --> 16:57.317
Gee, you tell me when
it's their anniversary.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.918
And you-- and you let
them stay at your house--

16:59.018 --> 16:59.886
- What?
- --next time they come.

16:59.986 --> 17:00.853
Good.

17:00.953 --> 17:01.921
--and decimate
your whole family--

17:02.021 --> 17:03.123
of which you don't
even have because you

17:03.223 --> 17:04.791
can't concentrate on
nothing long enough

17:04.891 --> 17:06.293
than it takes to chug a beer!

17:09.262 --> 17:11.298
And don't give me that wounded
little Jackie look either

17:11.398 --> 17:12.799
because that only
works on guys named

17:12.899 --> 17:15.935
Mike who drive El Caminos.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.638
Very dramatic, Roseanne.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.442
Oh, so now you're not
going to talk to me!

17:22.542 --> 17:23.710
God, would I love
to throw a hammer

17:23.810 --> 17:27.046
through a plate glass window.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.915
Don't wait for
a response, Dan,

17:29.015 --> 17:31.251
her majesty is not
speaking to anybody today.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.086
Hey, Jackie, who
even asked you?

17:33.186 --> 17:35.222
Hey, I'm a part
of this family too.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.624
Yeah, when your hamper is full
or your car needs working on.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.628
I've been a member of this
family longer then you have!

17:41.728 --> 17:43.263
Well, that's something
to be proud of!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.501
You know, I saw a whole
thing about this on Oprah.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.769
And that's just a
what we are, too.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.037
We're just like that.

17:51.138 --> 17:55.542
We are a dysfunctional family!

17:55.642 --> 17:58.911
[jackie screams]

18:02.382 --> 18:03.316
Thanks, Gramps.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.217
Bye, Gram.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.118
Bye, Becky.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.220
Goodbye, dear.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.956
Grandpa said he'd buy
me a horse next year.

18:10.056 --> 18:14.361
Yeah well, Grandpa's
saddle is on too tight.

18:14.461 --> 18:15.462
What are you doing?

18:15.562 --> 18:17.630
I'm making
breakfast for my kids.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.533
I already made them breakfast.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.734
- Go to school then.
- Bye.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.635
Bye.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.936
Bye, kids.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.405
Yeah, she made them breakfast.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.740
Cereal and chocolate
chip cookies.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.942
Your father gave
them the cookie.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.711
They eat them now
or in the afternoon.

18:31.811 --> 18:34.714
What's the difference?

18:34.814 --> 18:35.882
You want to know
the difference?

18:35.982 --> 18:37.584
I'll tell you what
the difference is.

18:37.684 --> 18:42.422
The difference is you show up at
my door unannounced, uninvited,

18:42.522 --> 18:44.757
you just drive everybody and
work them up into a frenzy

18:44.857 --> 18:46.326
till we're ready
to kill each other.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.927
What are you talking about?

18:48.027 --> 18:49.396
We're having a nice breakfast.

18:49.496 --> 18:52.265
I'm talking about if you guys
are gonna move here to Lanford

18:52.365 --> 18:54.801
you have got to move on to the
whole other side of this town

18:54.901 --> 18:56.135
because I'm not going
to be able to take

18:56.236 --> 18:57.637
this for the rest of my life.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.606
Who's moving to Lanford?

18:59.706 --> 19:00.873
You guys are.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.210
You said so last night.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.812
Ah, we're never gonna
move into Lanford.

19:05.912 --> 19:06.846
We were just thinking.

19:06.946 --> 19:08.080
We were just talking.

19:08.181 --> 19:12.084
Why do you take
everything so seriously?

19:12.185 --> 19:13.620
So you're not moving?

19:13.720 --> 19:16.055
No, in fact, we've
got to get going.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.691
We're on our way to see
cousin Sidney in Buford.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.660
He had gum surgery.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.595
I'm gonna buy him
some rock candy.

19:26.366 --> 19:30.803
Well, It's a shame you
couldn't have stayed longer?

19:30.903 --> 19:33.373
Dan, do you really mean that?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.308
Hey, if you don't
think you guys leaving

19:35.408 --> 19:39.078
is going to affect
everybody you're crazy.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.447
Al, did you that?

19:40.547 --> 19:41.514
Yeah.

19:41.614 --> 19:45.017
I'd give him a big
kiss if I liked boys.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.494
Oh Mom, I'm really
gonna miss ya.

19:54.594 --> 19:55.562
Me too.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.464
Aw, haw, haw.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.365
Ah.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.136
This has been a great visit.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.572
Oh, this has been
a wonderful visit.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.610
Let me do it again.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.913
[music playing]

20:16.416 --> 20:18.150
Did you wash your hands?

20:18.251 --> 20:20.520
Oh grow up!

20:20.620 --> 20:23.756
Oh, you're just cranky cause
mommy and daddy said goodbye.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.858
- No I'm not.
- Oh, come on, admit it.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.694
I get the same way.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.597
No matter how old you are you
never like to hear your mommy

20:30.697 --> 20:31.998
and daddy say goodbye.

20:32.098 --> 20:36.002
Well, yeah, I guess
it's that fear that you

20:36.102 --> 20:38.070
might never see him again.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.071
Baby, you'll see them again.

20:44.143 --> 20:48.848
I know, and the sick things
is that I kind of miss them.

20:48.948 --> 20:49.749
I kind of don't.
