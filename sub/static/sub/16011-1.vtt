01:55.160 --> 01:57.160
[Mia] This is Florence.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.500
One of the most beautiful

01:58.501 --> 01:59.800
cities in the world.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.600
For some, the most desirable

02:01.601 --> 02:03.360
place to be on Earth.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.720
But not for me.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.039
Today is my first day

02:09.080 --> 02:10.576
- at a prestigious
- international school

02:10.600 --> 02:12.520
In Florence.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.800
Most kids would be ecstatic

02:13.801 --> 02:15.040
about this opportunity,

02:15.080 --> 02:16.220
but my reality

02:16.221 --> 02:17.360
is very different.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.420
And it's about to change

02:18.421 --> 02:19.440
even more.

02:19.480 --> 02:20.800
[Aunt] In this school you're

02:20.801 --> 02:22.120
gonna meet a lot of nice people.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.320
Yeah, I'm sure...

02:25.160 --> 02:26.720
You are!

02:26.760 --> 02:28.320
[sighs]

02:28.360 --> 02:29.960
- Now, I'm gonna go see
- if I can find

02:30.000 --> 02:31.600
The principal's office, ok?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.640
You wait for me here.

02:33.680 --> 02:34.880
I'll be right back.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.120
[Vincent] C'mon, give it back!

02:45.440 --> 02:46.480
Please.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.480
[Vincent] Give that back!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.280
Who's she now?

02:58.320 --> 03:00.160
- And why is she dressed
- for Halloween?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
[girls laugh]

03:01.240 --> 03:02.480
True.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.120
And Halloween was months ago.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.080
- Thank you
- for picking up the book.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.720
[Aunt] Mia!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.880
- C'mon honey, the head mistress
- is waiting for you.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.500
No extracurricular activities

03:24.501 --> 03:26.320
at any of her six schools

03:26.360 --> 03:28.280
in the past four years?

03:28.320 --> 03:29.680
We do encourage our students

03:29.681 --> 03:31.040
to take part in them.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.840
- @But she's really
- good at languages.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.300
@She traveled all over the world

03:34.301 --> 03:35.720
with her parents bef...

03:35.760 --> 03:37.520
before... the accident,

03:37.560 --> 03:38.720
so she can pick up

03:38.721 --> 03:39.880
a new language like that.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.200
Mia?

03:48.280 --> 03:49.920
I know you've had

03:49.921 --> 03:51.560
a difficult time, child.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.740
I'm very sorry

03:52.741 --> 03:53.880
about your parents.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.960
This must all seem

03:55.961 --> 03:58.000
like a strange new world to you.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.440
Well I think

03:59.441 --> 04:00.840
that a whole new world

04:00.880 --> 04:03.320
is exactly what you need.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.320
Uuhh! The room is nice.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.600
Isn't it Mia?

04:11.640 --> 04:13.320
[Violetta] ...if I find any

04:13.321 --> 04:15.000
of my shoes in your closet,

04:15.040 --> 04:17.839
you are in so much...

04:19.120 --> 04:20.920
Well!

04:20.959 --> 04:22.340
It looks like your new roommate

04:22.341 --> 04:23.720
has arrived, Paula.

04:23.760 --> 04:24.820
We've heard

04:24.821 --> 04:25.880
so very little about you!

04:27.360 --> 04:29.120
I'm Violetta.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.660
And I'm sure we'll be

04:30.661 --> 04:32.160
the very best of friends.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.480
Or not!

04:39.000 --> 04:40.120
It's just gonna take

04:40.121 --> 04:41.240
a little bit of time.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.640
That's all.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.560
Your parents left this for you.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.936
- It was supposed to be
- for your birthday

04:59.960 --> 05:01.880
In a few weeks but...

05:01.920 --> 05:03.520
I wanna give it to you now.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.000
I'm gonna go back to the office

05:08.001 --> 05:09.680
and finish signing you in

05:09.720 --> 05:10.880
and then I'll be back

05:10.881 --> 05:12.040
to say goodbye. Okay?

05:29.120 --> 05:30.960
Centopia!

05:30.961 --> 05:32.800
I totally forgot about this!

05:36.080 --> 05:37.680
Elvish runes!

05:53.160 --> 05:55.200
"Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.920
Remember Centopia?

05:56.960 --> 05:58.100
Now it's a special game

05:58.101 --> 05:59.240
just for you."

06:01.960 --> 06:03.640
Dad made me a game?

06:11.720 --> 06:13.800
"I am Mia"?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.200
What does that mean?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.560
[computer voice] Hi Mia.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.400
Say your password.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.440
"I Am Mia"

06:43.680 --> 06:45.200
[screams]

06:50.000 --> 06:51.040
[grunts]

06:55.360 --> 06:58.360
This is... weird.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.280
Is this...

07:01.320 --> 07:02.360
[gasps]

07:02.400 --> 07:03.880
Centopia!?

07:10.320 --> 07:13.560
It's totally uh uh...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.080
amazing!

07:16.280 --> 07:19.280
No wait, this is impossible.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.920
But it's so beautiful.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.400
Oh my goodness!

07:29.401 --> 07:31.360
What's happened to me?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.560
Not bad though.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.280
Skirt could be a bit longer.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.640
[gasps]

07:37.680 --> 07:40.000
I've got wings!

07:40.040 --> 07:41.360
I don't believe it!

07:41.400 --> 07:43.200
I actually have wings!

07:43.240 --> 07:44.880
I'm... I'm...

07:44.920 --> 07:46.480
I'm an elf!

07:46.520 --> 07:47.680
[gasps]

07:47.720 --> 07:50.560
Which means... I can fly!

07:50.600 --> 07:51.680
[inhales]

07:57.800 --> 08:00.040
Woahhh! Agh!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.120
Okay, I can do this.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.120
[giggles]

08:05.200 --> 08:08.080
Yes! Yes! I'm flying!

08:09.280 --> 08:14.560
Uh oh, woah! Aaah! Woaaa...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.320
Agh! Oh oh...

08:18.240 --> 08:22.000
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

08:23.400 --> 08:24.800
AHCHOO!

08:24.840 --> 08:25.900
Okay, not so good

08:25.901 --> 08:26.960
with the wings.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.280
[♪♪♪]

08:36.799 --> 08:37.919
[gasps]

08:37.960 --> 08:39.240
Pans!

08:40.559 --> 08:41.799
Agh!

08:45.480 --> 08:46.920
Hello?

08:49.160 --> 08:50.280
Hey!

08:51.240 --> 08:53.600
[♪♪♪]

08:54.640 --> 08:56.040
Wait!

08:56.080 --> 08:59.480
Hold on! Where'd it go?

08:59.520 --> 09:01.180
Wow, I've never heard

09:01.181 --> 09:02.840
anything like this!

09:02.880 --> 09:04.640
[strident buzzing sound]

09:04.680 --> 09:06.680
Agh! I've definitely

09:06.681 --> 09:08.680
never heard anything like that.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.380
[cries] Wait! Wait!

09:10.381 --> 09:12.040
I'll try that again!

09:13.840 --> 09:16.120
[piercing buzzing sound]

09:16.160 --> 09:18.360
Aww duddlesnuff.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.200
I swear, this worked at home.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.280
I didn't know Pans could talk!

09:22.320 --> 09:24.520
Sure we can. To each other.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.680
Talking to anybody else

09:25.681 --> 09:26.800
is strictly forbidden.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.640
[gasps]

09:28.680 --> 09:29.840
Wait a second.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.680
You're somebody else.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.360
Ugh! Bad Phuddle! Bad Phuddle!

09:34.400 --> 09:35.880
- Hey! I won't tell anyone.

09:35.881 --> 09:37.360
- Really?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.500
Aw, that's so nice of you!

09:38.501 --> 09:39.600
[chuckles]

09:39.640 --> 09:42.520
Here, just follow me this way.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.140
But if anyone asks,

09:44.141 --> 09:45.720
I led you musically.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.060
[Phuddle] We are really not

09:53.061 --> 09:54.320
supposed to do this.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.600
Pans never interfere.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.880
- This is where I started!

09:57.881 --> 09:59.120
- Exactly!

09:59.160 --> 10:00.240
Maybe there's

10:00.241 --> 10:01.320
something important...

10:01.360 --> 10:02.760
nearbyyy...?

10:02.800 --> 10:04.040
What am I supposed to d...

10:04.080 --> 10:05.200
[whinning]

10:08.160 --> 10:09.880
- [snorts]
- [Mia gasps]

10:09.920 --> 10:11.680
[whinnies]

10:11.720 --> 10:13.520
Who would do this to a...?

10:13.560 --> 10:16.040
[gasps] ...a unicorn?

10:16.080 --> 10:17.580
I can't believe it!

10:17.581 --> 10:19.080
A real, live unicorn.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.520
[whinnies]

10:20.560 --> 10:22.160
Why aren't you helping her?!

10:22.200 --> 10:24.160
I'm a Pan! Rescuing unicorns

10:24.161 --> 10:26.120
is an elf's job!

10:26.160 --> 10:28.320
- Okay,
- so where do we find an elf?!

10:30.440 --> 10:31.880
Oh! Me!

10:33.040 --> 10:34.360
[whinnies]

10:34.400 --> 10:35.640
That's weird.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.400
Did you just say "be careful"?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.680
[neighs softly]

10:38.720 --> 10:40.240
That sounded like "hurry up"!

10:40.280 --> 10:41.400
- Ugh?

10:41.401 --> 10:42.520
- This is amazing!

10:42.560 --> 10:44.920
You can talk to unicorns?

10:44.960 --> 10:47.160
Eeh... Yeah, apparently...

10:47.200 --> 10:48.280
Say something else!

10:48.320 --> 10:49.920
[whinnies loudly]

10:49.960 --> 10:51.840
Oh right, "hurry up"!

10:55.720 --> 10:57.800
Woow.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.880
[neighs]

10:58.920 --> 11:01.240
You're so beautiful!

11:01.280 --> 11:02.480
[neighs]

11:04.720 --> 11:06.040
[neighs]

11:06.080 --> 11:07.440
Lyria?

11:07.480 --> 11:09.760
Hello Lyria. My name is Mia.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.000
[neighs]

11:11.040 --> 11:13.560
Really? You'll take me anywhere?

11:13.600 --> 11:15.360
There's so much I want to see.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.420
The waterfalls,

11:16.421 --> 11:17.440
the wild dragons,

11:17.480 --> 11:18.920
the unicorn fields...

11:18.960 --> 11:20.000
[gasps]

11:20.040 --> 11:21.120
The elf palace!

11:21.160 --> 11:22.640
Can you take me there?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.720
[neighs]

11:28.080 --> 11:29.160
[grunts with effort]

11:30.800 --> 11:32.600
- [gasps amazed]
- Thanks, Phuddle!

11:32.640 --> 11:33.760
I'll see you later!

11:33.800 --> 11:35.360
I... I... It's okay!

11:35.400 --> 11:36.400
I'll be fine right here!

11:36.401 --> 11:37.401
[chuckles]

11:37.440 --> 11:39.140
Not like I could've used

11:39.141 --> 11:40.840
a ride home or anything!

11:40.880 --> 11:44.160
Hate long goodbyes! Bye!

11:48.680 --> 11:50.360
[annoyed] Aaaghh!

11:50.400 --> 11:52.540
This looks like the work

11:52.541 --> 11:54.680
of those meddling elves!

11:54.720 --> 11:56.240
- [growls]
- Oh,

11:56.280 --> 11:57.960
- What am I going
- to tell Panthea?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.360
Hya!

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
[screeching]

12:09.640 --> 12:11.000
[Mia] Centopia is just like

12:11.001 --> 12:12.360
in the book.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.720
My dad used to read me

12:13.721 --> 12:15.040
a chapter every night.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.560
He called it Mia's Magic Hour.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.040
[sniffles]

12:19.080 --> 12:20.120
[neighs]

12:21.600 --> 12:23.320
[whinnies]

12:23.360 --> 12:24.400
[snorts]

12:30.560 --> 12:33.240
It's so beautiful!

12:33.280 --> 12:35.400
I want to see all of it!

12:35.440 --> 12:36.600
[gasps]

12:37.480 --> 12:38.920
Whoa!

12:40.800 --> 12:42.920
There's the Wistfull Waterfalls!

12:42.960 --> 12:44.760
- And there's
- the Field of Flowers!

12:44.800 --> 12:47.120
And the Uninteresting Hills!

12:47.160 --> 12:48.680
Funny, I thought

12:48.681 --> 12:50.200
they'd be more interesting.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.920
And where's the elf palace?

12:51.960 --> 12:53.560
- [whinnies]
- [gasps]

12:53.600 --> 12:56.840
There it is! I can't believe it.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.720
This place is perfect!

12:58.760 --> 13:00.000
[neighs]

13:00.040 --> 13:01.560
What do you mean "not quite"?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.120
Stay here.

13:15.160 --> 13:17.000
I'll take full responsibility

13:17.040 --> 13:18.680
for our mission's failure.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.520
Your Majesty.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.900
You promised me a unicorn

13:26.901 --> 13:29.240
by noontide today.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.200
[growls]

13:31.240 --> 13:33.480
I'm sorry, Queen Panthea!

13:33.520 --> 13:36.760
It wasn't me! It was them!

13:36.800 --> 13:40.280
They're completely incompetent!

13:41.520 --> 13:44.080
There was one unicorn in a trap!

13:44.120 --> 13:45.840
But someone let it go.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.720
It had to be the elves!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.600
Do you see this, Gargona?

13:49.640 --> 13:51.760
This is the very last

13:51.761 --> 13:53.880
unicorn horn in my possession.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.700
When it is gone, I will turn

13:55.701 --> 13:57.480
old and hideous again.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.520
[irritated] And you know how

13:59.521 --> 14:01.520
I hate to be old and hideous!

14:01.560 --> 14:02.600
Yes ma'am.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.400
And stop toadying to me!

14:21.560 --> 14:24.680
[laughs maniacally]

14:24.720 --> 14:26.320
[cat meows]

14:26.360 --> 14:28.100
You have but one order to obey,

14:28.101 --> 14:29.840
Gargona.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.760
Get me more unicorn horns.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.520
Get me all of them!

14:52.280 --> 14:53.540
[Mia] There it is!

14:53.541 --> 14:54.800
That's the elf mountain!

14:54.840 --> 14:56.840
The elf palace is inside!

14:56.880 --> 14:58.560
Come on, let's go!

14:58.561 --> 15:00.240
I've been dying to see this!

15:00.280 --> 15:02.040
[whinnies]

15:02.080 --> 15:03.520
Who's nearby?

15:03.560 --> 15:05.120
Where?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.520
[Yuko] I told you she's an elf!

15:06.560 --> 15:08.200
Look at the ears!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.480
Then how come

15:09.481 --> 15:10.720
we've never seen her before?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.800
Who's there?

15:13.840 --> 15:15.240
- Us!
- AAH!

15:17.520 --> 15:18.700
Who are you?

15:18.701 --> 15:19.880
What is your business here?

15:19.920 --> 15:22.200
And where'd you get that dress?

15:22.240 --> 15:23.560
Stop it, Yuko!

15:23.561 --> 15:24.880
We don't even know who she is!

15:24.920 --> 15:26.860
You're elves!

15:26.861 --> 15:28.800
You're actual elves! I'm Mia.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.960
I'm, uh... just visiting.

15:29.961 --> 15:31.080
And I don't wanna gush,

15:31.120 --> 15:33.216
- but I've always dreamt of
- actually meeting you for real.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.400
Oh really? You've heard of me?

15:35.440 --> 15:37.400
- Mo doesn't act much
- like a Prince.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.520
But he totally is!

15:39.560 --> 15:41.056
- Oh, I didn't mean you
- specifically.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.680
I just meant elves in general.

15:42.720 --> 15:43.840
[gasps]

15:43.880 --> 15:46.320
You're a prince?

15:47.640 --> 15:49.280
[neighs]

15:49.320 --> 15:51.720
Oh, this is Lyria.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.680
How do you know her name?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.400
Umm... she told me.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.400
Told you how?

15:57.440 --> 15:58.800
[neighs]

15:58.840 --> 16:00.840
No, we don't have to go, do we?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.760
- These are elves,
- just like me!

16:02.800 --> 16:05.600
Whoa. You understand her?

16:05.640 --> 16:07.360
That's just kooky!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.740
I think the King is gonna

16:08.741 --> 16:10.080
want to meet you.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.520
Really? Meet the elf king?

16:12.560 --> 16:16.600
At the elf palace? Right now!?

16:16.640 --> 16:17.900
[Mia] I've read

16:17.901 --> 16:19.160
about the elf palace,

16:19.200 --> 16:20.880
and there was a picture.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.680
- But the picture
- got ketchup on it

16:22.720 --> 16:24.680
- So I could never really see it
- after that.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.920
What's ketchup?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.320
[snorts]

16:30.760 --> 16:32.880
- So how come
- I've never seen you before?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.560
There's no way I'd forget you.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.880
[Mia] Um... I'm from

16:35.881 --> 16:37.160
pretty far away.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.040
Further than Misty Collar?

16:39.080 --> 16:40.760
- [Mia] Well,
- I don't know where that is,

16:40.800 --> 16:41.800
But I'm pretty sure

16:41.801 --> 16:42.801
it's further than that.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.080
You don't fly at all, do you?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.920
Um, I can.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.240
Sort of.

16:50.241 --> 16:51.520
But I like walking.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.800
Nice to feel the ground

16:52.801 --> 16:54.040
beneath your feet, you know.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.680
I like flying.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.980
Do you think you'll...

16:56.981 --> 16:58.240
stay for a while?

16:58.280 --> 16:59.800
Uum... I kind of have to.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.600
- I don't really know
- how to get back.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.860
What about going back

17:02.861 --> 17:04.079
the way you came?

17:04.119 --> 17:06.160
Yeah. You're probably right.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.520
Well, I think you should stay.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.339
You know, we'd get there

17:10.340 --> 17:12.119
a lot faster if we flew.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.960
Come on, Mo, let's fly.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.440
Where's Lyria?

17:17.480 --> 17:19.400
- Why would
- she just take off like that?

17:19.440 --> 17:20.760
Unicorns are funny creatures.

17:20.761 --> 17:22.079
They get nervous around...

17:22.119 --> 17:24.119
well, anyone.

17:24.160 --> 17:25.680
Except you.

17:25.720 --> 17:26.880
- Lyria?!

17:26.881 --> 17:28.040
- She could be in danger.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.640
The munculus are on the move.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.960
The who?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.240
Lyria?!

17:33.120 --> 17:34.280
Lyria!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.440
WHOOOOOOAAA!

17:36.480 --> 17:38.120
[Mo] Come on, fly with us!

17:39.560 --> 17:41.200
- [Yuko] She could be anywhere
- by now!

17:41.240 --> 17:42.736
- [Mo] We're going to have
- to split up!

17:42.760 --> 17:44.280
- We can cover
- more ground that way!

17:44.320 --> 17:46.680
I'll go west! Yuko, take East.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.040
- East, got it!

17:48.041 --> 17:49.360
- And you take north!

17:49.400 --> 17:50.920
Circle back here in ten minutes!

17:50.921 --> 17:52.440
We're gonna have to fly, okay?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.240
- Sure, no problem!
- [nervous giggle]

17:54.280 --> 17:55.760
Just set me down on that ro...

17:55.800 --> 17:57.440
WHOOOA!

17:57.480 --> 17:59.360
Wings! I have wings!

17:59.361 --> 18:01.240
I got this! I'm okay!

18:01.280 --> 18:02.940
Ugh! Maybe I don't have it!

18:02.941 --> 18:04.600
WHOOOOOAAAAA!

18:04.640 --> 18:08.800
Aaw! Aaaaw! Aaaaaagh!

18:09.520 --> 18:10.960
[grunts]

18:11.000 --> 18:12.160
[Mia] Augh!

18:14.400 --> 18:15.680
[gasps]

18:15.720 --> 18:17.120
[inhales/exhales]

18:17.160 --> 18:19.400
Aaggh! Sheesh!

18:19.440 --> 18:20.840
Oh, Phuddle!

18:20.880 --> 18:23.000
You help out the elves one time

18:23.040 --> 18:25.016
- and suddenly they feel like
- they can crash into you

18:25.040 --> 18:26.600
Whenever they feel like it!

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
- I'm sorry!
- But I'm so glad you're here!

18:28.840 --> 18:31.100
I'm not here!

18:31.101 --> 18:33.360
I am elusive as the wind!

18:33.400 --> 18:35.020
Phuddle, Lyria's in danger!

18:35.021 --> 18:36.640
Must know where she is.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.720
We're still not supposed

18:37.721 --> 18:38.760
to interfere.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.120
You have to take me to her.

18:40.121 --> 18:41.440
You have to!

18:41.480 --> 18:42.640
[sighs deeply] You never

18:42.641 --> 18:43.800
saw me.

18:43.840 --> 18:44.920
I was never here,

18:44.921 --> 18:46.000
we never talked.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.320
- Got it?
- Got it.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.560
Okay. Follow the luminous,

18:49.600 --> 18:52.400
mystical song of the Pans.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.120
[inhales deeply]

18:54.160 --> 18:55.760
[strident buzzing sound]

18:55.800 --> 18:57.300
Aw duddlesnuff.

18:57.301 --> 18:58.800
Just go that way.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.160
Thank you! I won't forget this!

19:02.320 --> 19:03.800
Mmmm!

19:06.080 --> 19:07.240
[sighs]

19:09.960 --> 19:11.800
- [Gargona] (WHISPERING)
- There's another one.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.040
Stay here

19:14.080 --> 19:16.160
and wait for my signal.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.400
[whispers] I've got you now.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.680
[Mia] Lyria!

19:24.720 --> 19:28.000
Ugh, forget it elf!

19:28.040 --> 19:29.400
Lyria, watch out!

19:29.440 --> 19:30.640
Hya!

19:32.360 --> 19:34.240
- [whinnies]
- Nooo!

19:34.280 --> 19:37.120
That unicorn is mine!

19:38.400 --> 19:40.040
- Agh!
- [Gargona] Huh?

19:40.080 --> 19:41.560
You don't put up

19:41.561 --> 19:43.040
much of a fight... for an elf.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.320
- You're not in the book.

19:44.321 --> 19:45.560
- What book?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.720
- Everyone in Centopia
- is supposed to be thoughtful,

19:47.760 --> 19:49.480
And kind, and filled with light.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.160
You're none of those things.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.000
Your book sounds awfully dull.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.080
Now stay out of my way.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.880
[neighs]

19:57.920 --> 19:59.440
If you're hurting Lyria,

19:59.441 --> 20:00.960
then I'm in your way.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.920
- Excellent, I thought
- for a minute

20:02.960 --> 20:05.320
This was going to be easy.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.200
Where's the fun in that?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.520
Ugh! Uh! Ugh!

20:13.160 --> 20:14.320
[grunts]

20:18.600 --> 20:20.080
Yuko! Over there!

20:22.760 --> 20:25.080
[laughing evilly]

20:26.240 --> 20:28.720
Noooo! Oh! Uugh!

20:28.760 --> 20:30.680
- [Mo] Nice shooting Yuko!
- Thanks!

20:30.720 --> 20:31.800
You're pretty good too...

20:31.801 --> 20:32.880
for a boy.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.720
[Gargona] More elves!

20:35.760 --> 20:37.280
That's more like it!

20:40.160 --> 20:42.240
[grunts]

20:42.280 --> 20:44.080
Uuugh!

20:45.440 --> 20:46.600
[Mo] Gargona!

20:47.920 --> 20:48.960
[roars]

20:50.080 --> 20:52.240
[growls]

20:52.280 --> 20:54.120
Ha ha! She's retreating!

20:54.160 --> 20:55.780
I'm not retreating,

20:55.781 --> 20:57.400
I'm regrouping!

20:57.440 --> 20:59.320
That's completely different.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.560
[laughs]

21:00.600 --> 21:02.240
[neighing]

21:02.280 --> 21:03.480
Lyria!

21:04.560 --> 21:06.240
Get off! Get off her!

21:07.240 --> 21:08.680
Are you okay?

21:08.720 --> 21:09.920
[snorts]

21:09.960 --> 21:11.480
I'm so glad I found you in time!

21:11.520 --> 21:12.760
[snorts]

21:13.760 --> 21:15.320
[whinnies]

21:15.360 --> 21:17.000
It's okay.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.060
You must see by now

21:18.061 --> 21:19.080
that they're friends.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.600
[snorts]

21:22.640 --> 21:24.440
She says "thank you".

21:24.480 --> 21:25.700
Mia, I think it's going

21:25.701 --> 21:26.920
to be handy having you around.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.220
[Yuko] If you can talk

21:32.221 --> 21:33.480
to the unicorns for us,

21:33.520 --> 21:35.840
- it's gonna make it a lot easier
- for us to help them!

21:35.880 --> 21:37.320
[Mia] I'll sure try.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.640
We're lucky we found you.

21:38.680 --> 21:40.280
And speaking of finding you,

21:40.320 --> 21:41.320
there's something

21:41.321 --> 21:42.321
I want to give to you.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.760
Next time you need us,

21:43.761 --> 21:45.160
just touch it, like this.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.160
[dings]

21:45.200 --> 21:47.040
That makes our ring flash.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.280
See?

21:48.320 --> 21:49.800
And if you tap it twice,

21:49.840 --> 21:50.900
the butterfly

21:50.901 --> 21:51.960
will lead you to us.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.480
Take me to Mia.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.760
See?

21:56.680 --> 21:58.120
I have one too!

21:58.160 --> 22:00.000
- They're fashionable
- and functional!

22:00.040 --> 22:01.720
It's called a Friendship Ring.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.520
"Friendship"! Nothing more.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.080
Wow, thanks! It's beautiful!

22:07.120 --> 22:09.080
Whoa. Where'd you get that?

22:09.120 --> 22:11.320
That's hard to explain.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.920
What's it doing? Whoops.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.600
I think this means I have to go!

22:15.640 --> 22:16.640
And I haven't even seen

22:16.641 --> 22:17.641
the palace yet!

22:17.680 --> 22:19.220
- WHOA! That's freaky!

22:19.221 --> 22:20.760
- What's happening?!

22:20.800 --> 22:23.240
I'll be back! I promise!

22:24.760 --> 22:26.760
Um... what just happened?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.600
- I don't know.
- But I have a hunch

22:28.640 --> 22:29.720
That we're going be seeing

22:29.721 --> 22:30.800
a lot more of her.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.480
No, no, not yet!

22:34.481 --> 22:35.720
I wasn't done!

22:36.600 --> 22:37.880
"I Am Mia!"

22:37.920 --> 22:39.720
Why isn't this working?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.280
Alright, Mia.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.160
- What's wrong?

22:46.161 --> 22:47.240
- You...

22:47.280 --> 22:48.400
You didn't wonder

22:48.401 --> 22:49.520
where I was all this time?

22:49.560 --> 22:51.160
Where you were?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.400
Where would you go

22:52.401 --> 22:53.600
in only five minutes?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.400
Five minutes?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.640
[laughs] Are you alright, Mia?

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
I think I will be.
