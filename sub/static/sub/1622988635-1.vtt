[sirens wailing]
[indistinct voice on radio]

00:21.424 --> 00:23.482
[sirens wailing]
[drill]

00:25.776 --> 00:26.833
[sirens stop]

00:34.997 --> 00:36.495
-Hey, God bless you, sir.
-Yeah.

00:37.083 --> 00:38.169
Yeah, this is Donovan.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.917
I'm coming up.
Be there in a minute.

00:45.576 --> 00:47.063
TWO CENTS FROM A PARIAH

00:47.146 --> 00:48.623
[distorted cha-ching]

00:51.380 --> 00:54.380
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm sorry I'm like this.

00:55.659 --> 00:56.753
No need to be sorry.

00:57.956 --> 00:59.980
You're going through
a very difficult time.

01:01.050 --> 01:03.316
Losing a significant other
can be an almost...

01:03.855 --> 01:06.108
incomprehensible assault
on the senses.

01:06.745 --> 01:08.995
-You're so kind.
-Just here to help.

01:10.573 --> 01:11.573
I'm...

01:12.487 --> 01:14.972
I'm inheriting a large amount
of my husband's money.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.200
When I signed the prenup
three years ago

01:18.283 --> 01:19.759
I actually felt good about it.

01:21.595 --> 01:22.994
But it feels dirty now.

01:26.298 --> 01:28.395
No one doubts
you loved your husband,

01:28.478 --> 01:29.478
Mrs. Daugherty.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.152
You were by his side
every step of the way.

01:32.235 --> 01:33.235
You deserve...

01:33.884 --> 01:35.345
everything that's coming to you.

01:36.994 --> 01:38.039
I cheated on him.

01:39.392 --> 01:40.851
The whole time I was with him.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.134
There were so many other men.

01:47.884 --> 01:48.884
Was he aware?

01:49.664 --> 01:50.664
I don't think so.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.114
We all make mistakes.

01:55.447 --> 01:57.145
But when I found out
he was sick,

01:57.228 --> 01:59.095
and I asked the doctor
how long...

02:01.720 --> 02:02.986
I wasn't thinking about...

02:04.033 --> 02:05.033
his pain.

02:07.744 --> 02:10.203
Or what he must be feeling.
I was thinking about...

02:11.506 --> 02:13.284
how long it'd be
until he'd be gone

02:13.367 --> 02:14.687
and I could have his money.

02:16.768 --> 02:18.722
How long until I could...

02:19.408 --> 02:21.141
stop sneaking around.

02:24.150 --> 02:25.658
My-- my daughter...

02:27.228 --> 02:29.486
she's actually older than me.
My step-daughter.

02:31.859 --> 02:33.773
When she looks at me
it's like she knows.

02:35.797 --> 02:36.797
Everything.

02:38.523 --> 02:39.920
Are you afraid she'll...

02:40.803 --> 02:42.436
-Expose you in some way.
-No.

02:43.414 --> 02:44.414
I don't know. I...

02:44.665 --> 02:46.367
Do you mind
if I run to the bathroom?

02:46.450 --> 02:47.605
No, of course.

02:47.688 --> 02:49.418
-Thanks. I'll be right back.
-Sure.

03:04.242 --> 03:05.242
[sighs]

03:24.941 --> 03:25.941
[exhales]

03:26.496 --> 03:27.496
[clears throat]

03:32.041 --> 03:34.737
[footsteps]

03:36.299 --> 03:37.299
Sorry about that.

03:40.805 --> 03:43.094
You must think
I'm a sick person.

03:44.446 --> 03:45.883
On the contrary...

03:46.977 --> 03:48.895
what you're feeling
is perfectly natural.

03:49.172 --> 03:50.172
It'll pass.

03:52.790 --> 03:53.790
The money.

03:54.258 --> 03:56.319
You could choose
to do great things with it.

03:56.753 --> 03:58.433
For yourself,
for others, charity.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.689
You do what you think is right,
and you'll...

04:01.772 --> 04:03.875
you'll find you'll drive out
the negativity.

04:03.958 --> 04:04.958
Like...

04:05.231 --> 04:06.955
an infection
through the bloodstream.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.790
You'll feel like a new person.

04:11.950 --> 04:12.950
What about the past?

04:15.067 --> 04:16.798
You do the right thing
long enough...

04:18.278 --> 04:20.260
you'll feel like the past
was never there.

04:23.486 --> 04:24.486
Trust me.

04:26.947 --> 04:29.839
Alright, I have
some calls to make

04:29.922 --> 04:31.571
and a few errands, but...

04:33.291 --> 04:35.580
-Here you are.
-Oh, thank you.

04:38.501 --> 04:39.814
So we'll speak again soon?

04:41.197 --> 04:42.197
I'd like that.

05:30.465 --> 05:31.465
[elevator beeps]

05:36.127 --> 05:38.060
[assistant] Good morning,
Mr. Strathmore.

05:38.143 --> 05:39.260
Good morning.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.268
-How are you today?
-I'm well, thank you.

05:42.932 --> 05:44.511
So what's on the docket
for today?

05:45.568 --> 05:48.348
It looks like you have a meeting
with Paul Anderson.

05:48.873 --> 05:51.766
And the McGuires
would like to see you tomorrow

05:51.849 --> 05:53.353
if that's alright.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.423
I didn't know
they were back from LA.

05:55.506 --> 05:56.506
Yeah.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.482
Paul Anderson.

05:59.052 --> 06:00.256
He say anything specific?

06:01.295 --> 06:04.239
Just that he'd like to see you
at his office instead of home.

06:04.673 --> 06:05.673
Okay.

06:15.507 --> 06:16.507
Thank you for coming.

06:17.523 --> 06:19.629
Of course, Paul.
What can I do for you today?

06:21.693 --> 06:22.857
Well, for starters..

06:23.670 --> 06:25.662
you remember that NDA form
I had you sign?

06:26.529 --> 06:27.529
Of course.

06:28.849 --> 06:29.849
Good.

06:31.637 --> 06:32.887
Alright [sighs].

06:33.909 --> 06:34.909
So...

06:35.621 --> 06:39.024
A little while ago
I hired a dominatrix.

06:40.596 --> 06:41.596
Yeah.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.182
You know,
to shake things up a bit.

06:45.682 --> 06:47.324
Nance doesn't know about her.

06:47.813 --> 06:48.813
Obviously.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.704
I do, and now you do.

06:52.524 --> 06:54.080
And I'd like
to keep it that way.

06:57.061 --> 07:00.038
Anyway, it was great at first,
I'll admit.

07:00.741 --> 07:02.679
She's fun. Oh, is she fun.

07:04.382 --> 07:08.140
She's a real mind fucker
if you know what I mean.

07:09.405 --> 07:12.515
But now I feel
that it's started to get

07:12.598 --> 07:13.598
into the deep end.

07:14.585 --> 07:15.624
And I want to end it.

07:16.913 --> 07:19.643
But I just can't seem
to get free of her.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.122
Are you feeling
financially constrained

07:23.205 --> 07:25.107
as a result
of her continuing services?

07:25.190 --> 07:27.656
No, I can afford it.

07:29.596 --> 07:32.393
That's not the problem.
It's more in my mind.

07:33.575 --> 07:36.685
And, as I told you,
Nance doesn't know.

07:37.622 --> 07:38.622
But my wife...

07:39.185 --> 07:40.710
she's far from stupid.

07:40.872 --> 07:43.816
Paul, you're going to need
to resist.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.133
For the good of
not only yourself,

07:46.216 --> 07:47.216
but everyone around you.

07:47.274 --> 07:50.762
You have got to stop
this poison from spreading.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.806
You're right, Donovan.
You're right.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.215
What a wonderful choice of words

07:55.298 --> 07:57.268
because she is poison
and you know what...

07:57.782 --> 07:59.270
I love drinking her.

08:00.501 --> 08:03.847
Getting fucking loaded on her.
I mean look at me.

08:03.930 --> 08:06.215
Look at me. I mean it's like...

08:06.298 --> 08:08.279
I think she might be able
to blackmail me.

08:09.493 --> 08:10.615
Here's the deal.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.237
Talk to her, Donovan, please.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.286
because you're the only one
that can fix this.

08:17.214 --> 08:19.701
I will make it worth your while.

08:20.284 --> 08:21.284
Name it.

08:27.976 --> 08:29.304
[slow jazz music playing]

08:32.638 --> 08:33.639
I'll stand.

08:34.756 --> 08:35.756
But you're shaking.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.352
I'll get right to the point.

08:41.773 --> 08:42.981
My client, Paul Anderson.

08:43.484 --> 08:44.589
He wants to stop seeing you.

08:44.672 --> 08:46.776
He's afraid if he does,
you'll blackmail him.

08:47.414 --> 08:48.414
[laughs]

08:49.711 --> 08:50.711
I'm a professional.

08:50.961 --> 08:52.843
I would never
actually blackmail anyone.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.851
He gets off on the idea
of it, that's all.

08:57.234 --> 09:00.609
He's free to go
without any consequences at all.

09:01.414 --> 09:03.501
But as long as he pays me
for my services...

09:04.211 --> 09:05.378
I'll give him my best.

09:05.836 --> 09:06.880
Yeah?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.307
You're saying he knows
you wouldn't blackmail him.

09:09.390 --> 09:10.484
Of course he does.

09:10.937 --> 09:12.594
He's a rich man
who has everything.

09:12.932 --> 09:14.846
So he pays
for the illusion of danger.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.693
Getting close
to what it'd feel like

09:16.776 --> 09:17.776
to lose everything.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.393
Without ever having to.

09:20.002 --> 09:21.144
It's all a game.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.324
That's a perverse way
of making a living.

09:23.407 --> 09:25.940
[laughing]
You're his life coach, right?

09:26.610 --> 09:29.175
The one who fills him
with all the religious fervor.

09:29.258 --> 09:31.597
I try to lead him
down the path of righteousness.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.822
So do I.

09:35.703 --> 09:36.907
As yourself this.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.453
Are you here...

09:40.254 --> 09:42.902
because you truly care
about his wellbeing?

09:44.637 --> 09:46.211
Or because he paid you
to be here?

09:52.783 --> 09:53.900
What fun you would be.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.104
Yeah, Paul. Donovan here.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.480
I called her, as you asked.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.488
She's something, isn't she?

10:07.571 --> 10:08.608
Yeah, listen Paul.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.160
I think that you seriously
need to tell your wife.

10:11.934 --> 10:14.116
No, Donovan, no.
I already told you

10:14.199 --> 10:16.051
that's not in the cards.

10:16.754 --> 10:19.395
She'd divorce me
and take everything.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.897
No, listen to me.
Whatever you think you have,

10:21.980 --> 10:23.913
what you're feeling
with this woman, is not real.

10:23.996 --> 10:24.996
It's a game.

10:25.957 --> 10:27.723
Especially the danger.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.015
Alright, now listen.

10:29.098 --> 10:30.999
You could leave her in a minute

10:31.082 --> 10:33.637
and there would be no
repercussions, she told me.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.527
-She said that?
-Yeah, she did.

10:37.488 --> 10:38.655
Listen, you...

10:38.738 --> 10:40.160
You pay me for advice, right?

10:41.224 --> 10:43.810
I think what you need to do
is accept that you're an addict.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.535
I think it's great you kept
the place here in New York.

11:01.074 --> 11:04.559
You two enjoying the break
from the LA scene?

11:05.309 --> 11:07.246
But it doesn't feel
like a break anymore.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.587
Brandon here just got offered
the best payday of his career.

11:11.356 --> 11:13.006
Leading role in a comedy.

11:13.902 --> 11:15.341
And he wants to turn it down.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.976
[Tori] Can you believe that?

11:17.059 --> 11:18.858
[Brandon] I've been going
nonstop, alright?

11:18.941 --> 11:21.146
I finally realized,
after so many years

11:21.229 --> 11:22.229
of being poor,

11:23.057 --> 11:24.184
that I'm doing pretty good.

11:24.408 --> 11:27.052
I want to take a break.
Just some time off, you know.

11:27.135 --> 11:28.744
Actually see my wife and kids.

11:29.471 --> 11:30.471
Otherwise...

11:31.033 --> 11:32.609
what's the point
of all this work?

11:35.968 --> 11:38.562
Well family is
what matters most.

11:38.968 --> 11:39.968
Exactly.

11:41.718 --> 11:43.338
Why does it feel like
you don't want to spend time

11:43.421 --> 11:44.421
with me anymore?

11:45.687 --> 11:46.687
Baby.

11:47.116 --> 11:49.023
I want to be able
to tell our kids...

11:50.204 --> 11:53.473
that their father was
the highest-grossing movie star

11:53.556 --> 11:54.579
of all time.

11:56.189 --> 11:58.882
Not that he squandered away
his opportunities.

11:59.415 --> 12:02.055
I mean what kind of example
would that set for our kids?

12:02.931 --> 12:05.816
Alright, let's all take
a deep breath.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.941
I was going on a date
after work.

12:18.535 --> 12:20.238
-So that's why... Yeah.
-Oh yeah?

12:20.551 --> 12:21.551
So...

12:23.923 --> 12:24.923
How'd it go?

12:26.743 --> 12:27.743
It was okay.

12:29.899 --> 12:31.821
What about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

12:32.718 --> 12:34.804
You know,
you never mentioned someone.

12:40.554 --> 12:41.554
Okay...

12:43.137 --> 12:44.636
Thank you all
for coming out tonight,

12:44.719 --> 12:47.429
and let's put our hands together
for the man of the hour,

12:47.719 --> 12:49.307
Mr. Donovan Strathmore.

12:54.234 --> 12:55.437
Thank you.

12:56.679 --> 12:59.054
Thank you, thank you all
very much, I...

12:59.633 --> 13:01.030
I appreciate your being here.

13:01.797 --> 13:04.781
It's been a great deal of time
since we were last together.

13:05.086 --> 13:07.328
And I have to confess,
the reason for that is...

13:07.625 --> 13:09.747
because of the fact
that I've been very busy

13:10.234 --> 13:12.667
working on my new book,
which I'm pleased to say

13:12.929 --> 13:16.045
is going to be released
within five days.

13:16.287 --> 13:18.459
So thank you all
for your support.

13:18.542 --> 13:19.850
[applause]

13:23.068 --> 13:24.822
Every time
we have new people here,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.014
we always acknowledge them.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.890
I see some old faces.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.947
I see a couple new faces,

13:30.030 --> 13:32.228
and I want to introduce
a couple people to you.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.046
Brandon

13:34.397 --> 13:35.514
and Tori McGuire.

13:35.795 --> 13:39.694
Brandon and Tori came in from LA
to be with us.

13:40.092 --> 13:43.353
And I know that everybody here
will give us the old welcome.

13:44.150 --> 13:46.137
Brandon, I'm very proud
of both of you

13:46.220 --> 13:47.327
for making the decision

13:47.525 --> 13:49.287
and taking that part
in that new film.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.590
I can speak for each of us
when I say

13:51.673 --> 13:54.395
that we are all going to be
front and center, first row

13:54.478 --> 13:56.586
when you make your premiere
here in New York.

14:13.468 --> 14:15.313
In the time
since our last gathering, I--

14:15.396 --> 14:16.397
I've been...

14:16.939 --> 14:18.596
I've been thinking a lot
about what it means

14:18.679 --> 14:20.193
to be a good person

14:20.836 --> 14:22.781
in this world of temptation.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.815
There are lots of opportunities
for people to go astray

14:25.898 --> 14:27.445
and have
self-injurious behavior.

14:28.039 --> 14:29.461
And for that reason I believe

14:30.000 --> 14:32.629
that it's a matter
of resisting temptation.

14:33.152 --> 14:36.437
The temptation to stray
from the path of righteousness.

14:36.520 --> 14:38.902
The temptation
of the material world.

14:41.629 --> 14:44.043
Temptation of the flesh.

14:48.069 --> 14:50.436
We must not allow ourselves
to become breasts.

14:55.538 --> 14:56.538
Beasts.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.899
We must...

15:03.486 --> 15:04.486
[Donovan clears throat]

15:06.734 --> 15:08.070
We must not become beasts.

15:09.344 --> 15:11.500
Excuse me. Um, sorry.

15:14.187 --> 15:16.298
We must rise
above the fires of the pit

15:16.381 --> 15:19.350
and transcend the shallow--
the so-called values...

15:20.030 --> 15:22.522
of this increasingly
material world.

15:24.551 --> 15:26.309
We must know...

15:27.135 --> 15:28.762
that the serpent
from the garden of Eden

15:28.845 --> 15:30.138
still lives here among us.

15:30.754 --> 15:31.754
Make no mistake.

15:34.306 --> 15:35.598
I think that went well.

15:35.681 --> 15:36.931
There were some donations.

15:39.423 --> 15:42.087
-Thanks.
-Excuse me, Mr. Strathmore.

15:43.470 --> 15:46.516
Could I speak with him briefly
in private if you don't mind.

15:47.363 --> 15:48.918
[assistant] No, not at all.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.371
I'll leave you two.

15:52.645 --> 15:53.703
Do your thing.

15:56.371 --> 15:58.406
Thank you
for your message tonight.

15:58.489 --> 16:00.710
I really appreciate all you do.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.202
Oh, really? Thanks.

16:03.285 --> 16:05.173
And thanks for coming.

16:05.832 --> 16:08.426
I was wondering,
do you have dinner plans?

16:09.723 --> 16:10.945
Well actually, I'm...

16:11.028 --> 16:13.556
You put together
such a great program and...

16:13.639 --> 16:16.058
I don't know. I thought
maybe I could take you out.

16:16.632 --> 16:18.811
Treat you to dinner.
Show my appreciation.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.650
Um...

16:26.025 --> 16:27.025
Well this is...

16:28.174 --> 16:30.865
It's a nice place, thank you
for getting the reservation.

16:31.803 --> 16:32.803
Wow.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.078
It's nice.

16:38.678 --> 16:39.678
Seeing you like this.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.960
Outside the realm
of a professional relationship.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.741
Seeing you just as... a man.

16:49.288 --> 16:50.397
I'm always just a man.

16:50.928 --> 16:51.928
You know what I mean.

16:52.512 --> 16:53.512
No, I...

16:54.141 --> 16:55.618
You-- you're so handsome.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.399
The more I look at your face
without a professional barrier.

17:01.535 --> 17:03.012
Thank you. Thank you for the...

17:04.223 --> 17:05.223
for the compliment.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.483
You look unprofessional, too.

17:09.069 --> 17:10.083
Did you know

17:10.165 --> 17:12.412
you're the first man
I've ever bought dinner for?

17:12.493 --> 17:15.034
No, no actually I insist
that I pick up the check.

17:15.596 --> 17:17.915
No, I forbid it.

17:19.294 --> 17:20.583
-I want to do it.
-You sure?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.300
Positively.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.092
You know my place isn't far.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.779
Want to walk me home?

17:29.818 --> 17:32.068
It would be very gentlemanly
of you.

17:32.795 --> 17:34.637
I don't like walking alone
in the dark.

17:36.653 --> 17:37.653
Okay.

17:44.956 --> 17:46.198
[foreboding music]

17:50.690 --> 17:52.777
You... You remind me of him.

17:55.972 --> 17:56.972
My husband.

18:01.299 --> 18:02.299
Um...

18:06.830 --> 18:08.291
Have you ever lost someone?

18:42.768 --> 18:43.768
I'm sorry.

18:45.354 --> 18:46.354
I can't do this.

18:52.651 --> 18:55.801
[eerie vocalization]

19:15.911 --> 19:17.154
[Donovan crying]

19:30.419 --> 19:31.661
I KNOW YOUR SECRETS.
DO AS I SAY

19:31.744 --> 19:33.818
OR THE WORLD WILL LEARN
ABOUT THE HYPOCRITICAL ADDICT

19:33.901 --> 19:35.216
WHO COULDN'T TAKE
HIS OWN ADVICE.

19:37.432 --> 19:38.901
[ominous music]

21:38.914 --> 21:42.089
IF YOU DON'T WANT THE WORLD
TO LEARN THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU,

21:42.172 --> 21:43.302
TRANSFER $1,000,000.

21:54.637 --> 21:57.960
THE BANK WON'T ALLOW ME
TO JUST WIRE THAT MUCH AT ONCE,

21:58.043 --> 21:59.317
I'LL NEED SOME TIME

22:06.034 --> 22:07.034
YOU HAVE 72 HOURS.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.653
IF YOU GO TO THE POLICE,
I'LL KNOW,

22:08.736 --> 22:11.455
AND YOUR SECRETS WILL BECOME
PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE IMMEDIATELY.

22:42.343 --> 22:44.029
Why were you
at my event last night?

22:44.648 --> 22:46.490
I was protecting my investment.

22:47.179 --> 22:48.325
Extorting me, you mean?

22:49.034 --> 22:50.867
I'm talking
about our mutual client.

22:52.195 --> 22:53.757
What's this about extortion?

22:53.840 --> 22:55.833
He was afraid
you were going to blackmail him.

22:56.452 --> 22:59.780
And I told you I would never
actually do that to someone.

22:59.863 --> 23:02.089
[man inside] Goddess Emiliana,
please come back.

23:02.805 --> 23:03.852
Is that him?

23:06.870 --> 23:09.471
Somebody hacked my computer
and they're threatening me.

23:10.034 --> 23:11.779
I saw you leave
before the event was over.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.601
You saying that it wasn't you?

23:14.128 --> 23:15.925
That's not my thing.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.564
I choose to work for a living.

23:19.323 --> 23:21.305
After all,
"we must not allow ourselves

23:21.388 --> 23:22.388
"to become breasts."

23:24.771 --> 23:26.155
If you want something else...

23:26.654 --> 23:27.948
make an appointment.

23:34.824 --> 23:36.832
What brings you here today,
Mr. Strathmore?

23:38.697 --> 23:40.424
Uh, I've been...

23:41.432 --> 23:42.546
I've been hacked.

23:43.135 --> 23:45.633
Somebody's trying to scare me
into giving them money.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.526
I see.

23:48.433 --> 23:49.803
Well I'll tell you up front,

23:50.269 --> 23:53.098
you're not the type of client
that usually rolls up in here.

23:53.557 --> 23:54.558
What do you mean?

23:55.526 --> 23:57.667
I worked Internal Affairs
for eight years.

23:58.206 --> 23:59.480
I was good at it.

23:59.831 --> 24:00.831
Too good.

24:01.269 --> 24:03.317
I realized they didn't
really want me to be.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.944
So I started up this firm
to help the people

24:06.027 --> 24:07.196
that can't afford our...

24:07.980 --> 24:08.980
rigged system.

24:09.737 --> 24:10.769
Clearly you can.

24:11.527 --> 24:12.527
That's what I mean.

24:13.589 --> 24:15.217
If you don't want to work
with me, I can just--

24:15.300 --> 24:16.300
Listen.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.291
Any idea who might be trying
to blackmail you?

24:22.378 --> 24:24.129
Could by anybody.
Somebody I met? I--

24:25.378 --> 24:26.761
Let's see, my-- my assistant.

24:28.065 --> 24:31.428
This client
named Marsha Daugherty.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.183
It's D-A-U-G-H-E-R-T-Y.

24:35.097 --> 24:37.855
I saw her on the day
that message came up

24:37.938 --> 24:39.157
on my computer screen.

24:39.837 --> 24:43.173
Then there's this dominatrix
that I had to talk to for work.

24:44.796 --> 24:46.197
Could be a punk hacker

24:46.280 --> 24:48.369
who's just got too much time
on their hands.

24:48.452 --> 24:51.069
I just, I can't rack my brain.
I just don't know.

24:51.398 --> 24:53.588
Alright, what about anybody
from your past

24:53.671 --> 24:54.910
that might have a grudge?

24:55.249 --> 24:56.249
Ex-lover?

24:59.240 --> 25:00.256
Yeah, there is one.

25:01.420 --> 25:05.004
Now look, this is
totally confidential, right.

25:05.709 --> 25:08.173
Any private investigator
who can't keep a secret...

25:08.256 --> 25:10.092
is a private investigator
without work.

25:10.756 --> 25:12.201
And I know your money's green.

25:14.045 --> 25:15.045
Alright.

25:16.502 --> 25:17.558
So there's this woman.

25:18.486 --> 25:20.352
But I haven't heard from her
in decades.

25:22.525 --> 25:23.772
Can you tell me her name?

25:24.017 --> 25:26.235
Of course. It's Maureen...

25:27.727 --> 25:30.094
Nyman. N-Y-M-A-N.

25:34.842 --> 25:36.319
She'd be about my age now.

25:38.413 --> 25:41.048
Look, I only have a couple days
to solve this, so I...

25:41.131 --> 25:42.975
Alright. I'll do my best.

25:43.889 --> 25:44.975
But full disclosure,

25:45.873 --> 25:48.006
that's nearly an impossible
turnaround time.

25:48.709 --> 25:49.709
No guarantees.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.600
Alright.

25:56.982 --> 25:58.451
Now let's talk fees.

26:08.762 --> 26:11.676
[phone vibrating]

26:16.786 --> 26:17.786
Hello?

26:18.443 --> 26:19.985
-[PI] Mr. Strathmore.
-Yeah.

26:20.068 --> 26:21.575
-This is Rod Fitzgerald.
-Okay.

26:22.700 --> 26:25.857
Still working on a few angles,
but there's one that went cold.

26:26.521 --> 26:27.521
Maureen Nyman...

26:28.279 --> 26:30.247
She died about two years ago.

26:31.365 --> 26:32.365
Overdose.

26:33.324 --> 26:35.010
I'll stay in touch
with any updates.

26:35.886 --> 26:36.886
Sure.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.682
[phone clatters on ground]

27:01.370 --> 27:04.920
LOVE ALWAYS, MAUREEN

27:49.913 --> 27:50.913
[ominous music]

27:52.718 --> 27:53.718
[no audible dialogue]

28:32.044 --> 28:34.171
I got something
I want you to take a look at.

28:37.493 --> 28:39.676
From the security cameras
at the event.

28:39.875 --> 28:42.846
Had to pull a few strings
with my friends at the precinct.

28:44.594 --> 28:47.513
Looks like this young lady
snuck into your dressing room.

28:47.596 --> 28:49.519
Probably messed
with your computer there.

28:50.573 --> 28:51.682
Do you recognize her?

28:55.251 --> 28:56.719
Your ex, Maureen...

28:57.391 --> 28:59.876
had a daughter in '89
named Evelyn Nyman.

29:01.196 --> 29:03.700
The father was a fellow
by the name of David Schmidt.

29:04.577 --> 29:05.911
Pulled her bank statements.

29:06.609 --> 29:08.705
She took a trip recently
here to the city.

29:09.476 --> 29:11.804
Positive match on her ID
in those photos.

29:14.743 --> 29:17.005
Any reason she'd have a grudge
against you?

29:19.618 --> 29:20.618
No.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.058
Can I keep these?

29:31.072 --> 29:34.314
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

29:51.295 --> 29:54.960
I'LL SEND YOU THE MONEY.

29:57.801 --> 29:58.839
He's going to do it.

30:05.393 --> 30:06.430
[chuckles]

30:14.095 --> 30:15.454
[polite applause]

30:18.507 --> 30:20.002
I've had the chance
to read the book.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.921
It's one hell of a story.

30:22.241 --> 30:24.990
Thanks, Connie. That means a lot
coming from you. Thank you.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.860
Would you care to give
some of those

30:26.943 --> 30:28.660
who might be unfamiliar
a little background.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.888
Sure, well...

30:30.412 --> 30:31.413
You know, Connie,

30:31.496 --> 30:33.206
once you get
to a certain point in life,

30:33.646 --> 30:36.793
You start to think about
how you got to where you are.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.750
Everyday I deal
with some powerful

30:39.833 --> 30:41.417
and well-known people, right?

30:42.136 --> 30:45.537
And if you had told me,
when I was young,

30:45.620 --> 30:47.467
that I would be doing this
for my job,

30:47.550 --> 30:49.933
I would've thought
that you were joking.

30:50.839 --> 30:53.279
So there were reports
that came out recently

30:53.362 --> 30:55.270
that claimed to prove
a very different...

30:55.839 --> 30:57.151
story about your history.

30:57.495 --> 30:58.607
Are you aware of that?

30:59.733 --> 31:00.764
First I've heard of it.

31:00.847 --> 31:03.111
They were leaked very recently.
These reports...

31:04.558 --> 31:05.558
They claim...

31:06.120 --> 31:08.315
that you actually
spent some time in prison.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.678
And that you had an--

31:11.761 --> 31:14.276
No, no these were not...

31:14.714 --> 31:16.628
These weren't in our list
of questions.

31:17.011 --> 31:19.753
Let's get back to
the-- this is...

31:20.315 --> 31:22.823
Would you care
to set the record straight?

31:23.105 --> 31:26.050
Mr. Strathmore,
I have the reports right here.

31:26.698 --> 31:29.346
-These documents appear valid.
-This is...

31:29.429 --> 31:30.862
-Unbelievably unprofessional.
-Appear--

31:30.945 --> 31:33.718
No, this interview is over.

31:40.057 --> 31:42.057
-Call the car.
-Already on it, sir.

31:44.212 --> 31:46.363
These weren't
in our list of questions.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.149
Let's get back to
the-- this is...

31:49.751 --> 31:52.290
Would you care
to set the record straight?

31:52.571 --> 31:55.496
Mr. Strathmore,
I have the reports right here.

31:56.149 --> 31:58.691
-These documents appear valid.
-This is...

31:58.774 --> 32:00.371
-Unbelievably unprofessional.
-Appear--

32:00.454 --> 32:03.071
No, this interview is over.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.758
LYING AUTHOR EXPOSED
AT BOOK SIGNING.

32:13.276 --> 32:14.479
WHY WOULD ANYONE
BUY THE BOOK ANYWAY?

32:14.562 --> 32:16.143
THAT'S A MINUTE OF MY LIFE
I'LL NEVER GET BACK.

32:19.855 --> 32:23.013
ANYONE ELSE READ THE LEAK
ABOUT THIS GUY?

32:23.096 --> 32:24.777
PEOPLE LIKE STRATHMORE
PERPETUATE A VERY WARPED VERSION

32:24.860 --> 32:25.861
OF CHRISTIANITY.

32:42.408 --> 32:45.376
...you may hang up,
or press one for more options.

32:45.478 --> 32:47.340
Mrs. Williamson,
I haven't heard back from you

32:47.423 --> 32:49.103
about our next session.

32:49.798 --> 32:52.134
Please let me know
if we're still on, thanks.

32:56.938 --> 32:58.059
[ringing]

33:02.673 --> 33:04.165
Hey, this is Brandon McGuire.

33:04.626 --> 33:06.548
Leave a message
after the tone. Thanks.

33:07.064 --> 33:09.447
Brandon, Donovan here.

33:10.357 --> 33:12.617
Wanted to see how you and Tori
are doing, and...

33:12.700 --> 33:14.492
see about scheduling
our next session.

33:14.911 --> 33:17.794
So say hi to the kids
and take care in the meantime.

33:18.802 --> 33:19.802
Bye.

33:22.091 --> 33:23.525
[muffled speech]

33:23.608 --> 33:25.921
Publisher's not happy at all
with how that interview went.

33:27.124 --> 33:29.697
They've printed out
a lot of copies,

33:29.780 --> 33:31.801
which means
it's a big investment for them.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.096
They want to be sure

33:33.179 --> 33:35.096
before they go on
with any more publicity.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.549
It's about the sales.
I'm sure you understand.

33:37.632 --> 33:39.559
Well, I'm sure everything
will blow over.

33:41.593 --> 33:42.593
Good luck to you.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.045
[footsteps receding]

33:50.342 --> 33:51.342
[sighs]

33:55.699 --> 33:56.699
[computer chimes]

34:02.460 --> 34:04.417
THE RIDER NATHAN SHOW
DONOVAN STRATHMORE: FRAUD

34:04.937 --> 34:08.252
Donovan Strathmore, a life coach
to the rich and famous,

34:08.335 --> 34:11.018
has just been exposed
by an anonymous source

34:11.101 --> 34:14.322
as a man leading a life
very different

34:14.405 --> 34:16.096
from the advice he dishes out

34:16.601 --> 34:18.010
at a book signing recently.

34:18.092 --> 34:20.416
He was asked
about some of these allegations

34:20.498 --> 34:22.569
and unable to conjure up
any defense.

34:23.187 --> 34:24.228
He just walked out.

34:25.601 --> 34:28.065
I don't know
if you've seen the video.

34:29.312 --> 34:31.027
It's something
to check out. Look...

34:31.444 --> 34:32.471
We've since learned

34:32.554 --> 34:34.239
his actual name
is David Schmidt.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.291
He's a recovering alcoholic
and drug addict

34:36.373 --> 34:38.143
with a very checkered past.

34:38.226 --> 34:41.246
Including a DUI,
where he hit a child pedestrian

34:41.929 --> 34:44.085
who is now wheelchair-bound
for life.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.440
Look it's not uncommon
for public personalities

34:47.523 --> 34:49.181
change their names
to protect their privacy,

34:49.264 --> 34:53.181
However this guy has been
covering up lots more than that.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.908
He was arrested for distributing
illegal substances

34:55.991 --> 34:58.796
just a few years
after the accident.

34:58.879 --> 34:59.892
Didn't learn his lesson.

34:59.975 --> 35:01.798
Then he spent some
time behind bars.

35:01.881 --> 35:04.060
Strathmore's book
touches on none of this.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.365
In fact, it appears
to be offering

35:06.448 --> 35:09.057
a completely revised history.

35:09.378 --> 35:11.307
-I got your message.
-What do you want?

35:13.022 --> 35:16.326
-Where'd you find that video?
-That's just one of many.

35:16.409 --> 35:17.699
They're all over the place.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.202
Look, I'd really rather
not hear from you again.

35:26.980 --> 35:29.257
Here's an interview
with Strathmore's assistant.

35:29.340 --> 35:32.801
I've been his assistant
for two years.

35:34.746 --> 35:36.207
I used to admire him.

35:36.597 --> 35:38.639
But I guess it just
makes you question

35:38.722 --> 35:40.410
if you ever
really know somebody.

35:41.613 --> 35:42.785
I need you to punish me.

35:48.621 --> 35:50.690
[leather thwacks]
Tell me you're a sick man.

35:51.653 --> 35:53.113
-Say it, David.
-I'm a...

35:54.246 --> 35:55.330
I'm a sick man.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.377
Tell me you're a hypocrite.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.190
I'm a hypocrite.

36:15.892 --> 36:17.592
[different accent] I'm happy
you came back to see me.

36:20.283 --> 36:21.283
Your voice...

36:22.689 --> 36:23.689
Your name.

36:28.059 --> 36:30.063
I'm sorry I accused you
of hacking me, I...

36:31.356 --> 36:33.491
The more I thought about it
the more I realized.

36:33.574 --> 36:36.574
I went to your event
because Paul invited me to.

36:37.848 --> 36:40.073
He said he wanted to see
if he could resist me.

36:43.574 --> 36:45.309
As I was leaving, I saw a girl.

36:45.559 --> 36:46.955
Wearing gloves, walking out.

36:47.488 --> 36:50.801
Thought maybe she was catering
at first, or something.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.505
Did you ever find out
who blackmailed you?

36:58.931 --> 36:59.931
Was it her?

37:04.742 --> 37:06.725
Been seeing your name around
a lot lately.

37:08.381 --> 37:10.201
You're becoming
a regular pariah.

37:15.224 --> 37:17.962
They say it's never too late
to choose to be a good man.

37:19.938 --> 37:20.938
I believe that.

37:23.493 --> 37:25.452
You know what I see
when I look at you?

37:27.407 --> 37:29.480
A man who wants to atone
for his sins.

37:31.596 --> 37:33.947
A man who desperately wants
to do the right thing.

37:35.510 --> 37:37.255
I think you should be
given a chance.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.549
Nobody else does.

37:43.135 --> 37:44.135
[she sighs]

37:44.877 --> 37:46.869
People are so ready
to assume the worst.

37:47.650 --> 37:50.282
They have a rabid appetite
to destroy anyone

37:50.365 --> 37:51.644
with any sort of platform.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.730
Especially those
they disagree with.

37:54.557 --> 37:57.627
It's sometimes justice,
but it's always theater.

37:59.721 --> 38:01.955
Heroes and villains,
black and white.

38:02.879 --> 38:03.907
Good and evil.

38:04.872 --> 38:06.723
The mind of the masses
is a simple one.

38:09.942 --> 38:11.831
The world could use
a little tenderness.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.468
I'm not going to charge you
for the session.

38:15.551 --> 38:16.586
It was my pleasure.

38:18.645 --> 38:19.645
Strange.

38:21.614 --> 38:23.067
Here, now...

38:25.136 --> 38:26.679
I'm experiencing
the only kindness

38:26.762 --> 38:27.966
that I might have for...

38:31.942 --> 38:33.186
maybe the rest of my life.

38:35.074 --> 38:36.074
[laughs]

38:37.598 --> 38:39.746
-Thank you.
-Always remember...

38:40.988 --> 38:42.529
People are never just one thing.

38:45.097 --> 38:46.324
I'll go grab you a towel.

39:02.084 --> 39:04.001
Look don't tell me
to try and calm down.

39:04.084 --> 39:05.845
I'm trying to explain this
to you, I've been hacked.

39:05.928 --> 39:08.197
I want to make sure
you cancel everything.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.959
The credit cards,
everything, hold--

39:10.866 --> 39:13.584
Excuse me, I have a call.
Hold on please, do not...

39:14.053 --> 39:15.053
get off the phone.

39:15.663 --> 39:16.663
Yeah.

39:18.481 --> 39:19.509
Yes?

39:19.592 --> 39:21.799
Why didn't you tell me
you were Evelyn's father?

39:21.882 --> 39:23.117
That you changed your name?

39:23.624 --> 39:24.895
You left out a crucial detail

39:24.978 --> 39:26.593
that could've helped
the investigation.

39:29.437 --> 39:30.535
Doesn't matter anymore.

39:31.531 --> 39:32.531
I guess it doesn't.

39:34.398 --> 39:36.343
Your daughter,
she lives in Wisconsin.

39:37.718 --> 39:40.076
If you want to ask her
for your money back or something

39:40.159 --> 39:41.713
I can tell you where she works.

41:26.812 --> 41:27.922
[no audible dialogue]

41:54.846 --> 41:56.096
What the fuck
are you doing here,

41:56.179 --> 41:57.265
you sick fuck?

41:59.906 --> 42:00.953
I know it was you.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.282
You promised me you wouldn't
give out that information

42:04.365 --> 42:05.365
if I gave you what you wanted.

42:05.873 --> 42:08.216
Yeah? Well promises, promises.

42:09.224 --> 42:11.294
What'd you do when you found out
you knocked up my mom?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.130
You ran off.

42:14.677 --> 42:17.257
Do you know she lost
all her friends because of that?

42:17.340 --> 42:20.011
Everyone saw her as a burden
and didn't want to help her.

42:21.418 --> 42:24.027
She did nothing wrong,
but love your sorry fucking ass.

42:24.410 --> 42:26.199
And she paid a terrible price
for it.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.741
And she couldn't forget you
because seeing me everyday

42:29.824 --> 42:31.223
made that impossible for her.

42:33.473 --> 42:35.051
No, now you know what it's like

42:35.332 --> 42:36.488
to feel untouchable.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.920
Can we-- can we go somewhere
to talk?

42:41.350 --> 42:42.860
-I just want to talk.
-Oh my God.

42:42.943 --> 42:44.509
I didn't invite you here, dude.

42:44.592 --> 42:46.230
I don't want
to fucking talk to you.

42:47.131 --> 42:48.329
I don't owe you anything.

42:48.412 --> 42:50.415
I don't owe it to you
to hear your sob story

42:50.498 --> 42:51.944
and cleanse you of your guilt.

42:53.743 --> 42:56.227
You are feeling exactly
how you should be feeling.

42:58.658 --> 43:00.286
You made a big mistake
coming here.

43:01.486 --> 43:02.560
Get the fuck away from me

43:02.643 --> 43:03.778
before I call the bouncers
on your ass

43:03.861 --> 43:05.291
and issue a restraining order.

43:07.775 --> 43:08.775
Okay.

43:10.017 --> 43:11.017
I'll go.

43:12.040 --> 43:13.040
I'm waiting.

43:21.269 --> 43:22.269
[thoughtful music]

43:53.233 --> 43:54.465
You've got five minutes.

43:55.372 --> 43:56.372
Follow my car.

43:59.544 --> 44:00.544
[background chatter]

44:04.818 --> 44:06.931
Out of all the names
you could've picked...

44:07.014 --> 44:09.605
where the fuck did you come up
with Donovan Strathmore?

44:10.873 --> 44:13.401
You're telling me you don't have
a stage name at work?

44:13.619 --> 44:14.944
[waitress]
Can I get you anything?

44:15.525 --> 44:16.736
-Coffee.
-Coffee.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.634
-Two coffees. Anything else?
-No, thanks.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.661
So.

44:24.422 --> 44:25.508
You tracked me down.

44:28.804 --> 44:30.750
Came all the way here.

44:32.359 --> 44:34.088
What were you expecting
would happen?

44:35.320 --> 44:36.636
I just wanted to see you.

44:36.719 --> 44:37.870
You're not getting
the money back.

44:37.953 --> 44:39.906
It's not a--
It's not about the money.

44:40.898 --> 44:42.667
-Look, I'm sorry--
-Everything you thought--

44:42.750 --> 44:44.909
You thought you could make
some kind of comeback story

44:44.992 --> 44:45.992
for yourself.

44:46.515 --> 44:48.479
The reformed man, born again,

44:48.562 --> 44:50.386
with a shitty new name
by the way,

44:50.469 --> 44:51.939
handing out overpriced advice.

44:52.414 --> 44:53.750
-I help people.
-Oh.

44:54.414 --> 44:56.164
Have you? Only the rich.

44:56.789 --> 44:58.154
That's not very Christ-like.

44:58.648 --> 45:00.197
Everyone's equal
in the eyes of the Lord.

45:00.750 --> 45:01.844
But not in your eyes.

45:02.719 --> 45:04.562
They have to be able
to afford you

45:05.125 --> 45:06.445
to get your services.

45:07.580 --> 45:08.581
Look around.

45:09.976 --> 45:12.789
Have you ever helped anyone
who truly needed it?

45:15.140 --> 45:16.214
That's what I thought.

45:17.539 --> 45:19.164
Maybe all this money
you're making,

45:19.247 --> 45:21.770
maybe that's your new drug,
your new high.

45:22.672 --> 45:23.672
Think about it.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.320
Anything else?

45:28.297 --> 45:29.922
This is great, thank you.

45:35.970 --> 45:37.744
So really, all I get
is five minutes?

45:38.353 --> 45:39.822
Yeah. We're on the clock.

45:40.564 --> 45:41.822
Like one of your sessions.

45:42.767 --> 45:43.824
It's already been two.

45:46.843 --> 45:47.995
I was hoping to maybe...

45:48.843 --> 45:51.093
find a way to make things right
with you.

45:51.765 --> 45:52.765
[she laughs]

45:53.030 --> 45:54.030
Oh shit.

45:57.536 --> 45:59.341
We are way past that point, man.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.875
I mean did you ever read
any of the letters

46:01.958 --> 46:03.029
I sent you growing up.

46:03.552 --> 46:04.927
I sent so many.

46:05.950 --> 46:07.685
And I never got one response.

46:08.047 --> 46:09.047
Not one.

46:10.734 --> 46:11.734
You know, Mom...

46:12.561 --> 46:14.019
Mom was furious
when she found out

46:14.102 --> 46:15.189
I'd been writing you.

46:16.539 --> 46:19.187
I'd found your address.
Written it down somewhere.

46:24.369 --> 46:25.783
I still have all the letters.

46:26.955 --> 46:27.955
All of them.

46:35.446 --> 46:37.712
So what made you come up with
this scheme to get the money.

46:41.310 --> 46:43.843
Heaven helps us cope
with knowing we're going to die.

46:44.701 --> 46:45.873
The American dream...

46:46.857 --> 46:49.571
helps us think that
all our hard work and suffering

46:49.654 --> 46:51.181
will pay off once we're rich

46:51.264 --> 46:52.787
and join the elites.

46:53.974 --> 46:56.639
I've got not time for bullshit
bedtime stories, old man.

47:01.482 --> 47:02.482
Your time's up.

47:05.412 --> 47:06.884
I'm staying at the motel
down the street

47:06.967 --> 47:08.117
if you want to see me again.

47:08.412 --> 47:09.451
Room 108.

47:15.712 --> 47:16.712
That's my daughter.

48:26.363 --> 48:27.363
You snore.

48:29.082 --> 48:30.241
How did you get in here?

48:32.371 --> 48:34.778
Computers aren't the only thing
I can break into.

48:34.861 --> 48:36.122
I didn't think you'd come.

48:37.033 --> 48:38.799
I'm the embodiment of your sins.

48:40.556 --> 48:42.549
I'm starting to enjoy
making you squirm.

48:47.689 --> 48:48.689
Let me...

48:53.072 --> 48:54.348
Let me show you something.

49:08.779 --> 49:12.158
MY HOUSE

49:17.879 --> 49:19.415
I'm sorry
I didn't give you that.

49:32.619 --> 49:33.619
You asked why.

49:34.401 --> 49:35.401
The money.

49:36.822 --> 49:38.908
God, life
is so fucking hard, man.

49:40.049 --> 49:41.486
Mom and I never had much.

49:42.306 --> 49:43.634
She never stopped using.

49:48.540 --> 49:50.196
Now I have
a one-year-old daughter.

49:51.017 --> 49:52.040
Her name's Maureen.

49:53.275 --> 49:54.290
Named after my mom.

49:56.377 --> 49:57.377
Where is she?

50:00.322 --> 50:01.322
With her dad.

50:05.044 --> 50:06.917
You know if you needed money
you could have asked me.

50:07.000 --> 50:08.297
I would've given it to you.

50:11.867 --> 50:13.909
You ignored me my entire life.

50:14.823 --> 50:17.139
Why would I think
that you would suddenly change?

50:19.690 --> 50:20.690
Who's the father.

50:21.088 --> 50:23.243
My fiancé, Adam.

50:24.462 --> 50:27.063
This whole thing was actually
part his idea.

50:28.173 --> 50:30.444
We needed a way
to keep food on the table, okay?

50:31.827 --> 50:34.080
We thought with enough money
that we could...

50:34.163 --> 50:37.694
finally live free, and simple,
and move west where it's warm.

50:40.328 --> 50:41.328
Have a small wedding.

50:42.758 --> 50:44.648
And give Maury
a comfortable childhood.

50:47.305 --> 50:48.305
When are you moving?

50:50.808 --> 50:52.511
I don't know,
a few months maybe.

50:53.004 --> 50:54.160
Tie up some loose ends.

50:58.207 --> 50:59.207
I, um...

51:01.135 --> 51:03.060
I appreciate you telling me
that I'm a...

51:04.096 --> 51:05.096
a grandfather.

51:05.393 --> 51:06.978
I know you could've
left that out.

51:08.424 --> 51:09.424
Yeah, well...

51:09.830 --> 51:11.713
I appreciate
you keeping my letters.

51:12.987 --> 51:15.349
But I also fucking hate you
for never writing me back.

51:15.432 --> 51:16.432
I understand.

51:21.154 --> 51:22.154
Look, um...

51:26.125 --> 51:27.751
I wonder
if I can meet your family.

51:30.396 --> 51:31.396
I don't think so.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.719
Adam doesn't know you're here.
It's not a good idea.

51:36.802 --> 51:37.802
Why?

51:37.885 --> 51:39.758
He'd think that you
just want your money back.

51:39.841 --> 51:41.860
And I'm not entirely sure
it's not why you're here either.

51:41.943 --> 51:43.688
No, it's not about the money.
It's about trying--

51:43.771 --> 51:45.490
No, I told you no sob story.

51:47.084 --> 51:48.607
Oh God, I've got to go.

51:49.052 --> 51:50.052
Will I see you again?

51:53.239 --> 51:54.864
-I have another key.
-I don't care.

52:20.101 --> 52:21.101
[car ignition]

52:51.176 --> 52:53.045
[muffled country music
playing in store]

53:19.030 --> 53:20.030
God bless you.

53:21.365 --> 53:24.187
You know there's some breakfast
at this place that I'm staying.

53:24.270 --> 53:26.637
-I could bring you some.
-Eat shit.

53:34.378 --> 53:38.507
VACANCY

53:40.839 --> 53:41.839
[latch turning]

53:45.347 --> 53:46.598
Why are you on your knees?

53:49.531 --> 53:50.853
-I'm praying.
-Oh.

53:51.257 --> 53:52.562
That's what it is, okay.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.666
Because from here
it kind of looks

53:54.749 --> 53:56.233
like you're blowing
the Holy Spirit.

53:56.632 --> 53:59.367
Which is a little homoerotic
for Christianity, no?

54:00.882 --> 54:03.073
Why do you feel the need
to criticize my faith?

54:19.667 --> 54:20.776
Did you do Twelve Step?

54:22.775 --> 54:23.775
Yeah.

54:24.618 --> 54:25.804
Someone force you to go?

54:27.384 --> 54:28.384
No.

54:31.679 --> 54:33.515
And in recovery
is where you found God?

54:38.093 --> 54:39.526
I didn't have a moral compass.

54:41.624 --> 54:43.530
Didn't worship anything
but my next high.

54:45.234 --> 54:46.234
Drugs,

54:47.015 --> 54:48.273
alcohol, sex, all of it.

54:57.298 --> 54:58.923
You took the initiative.

55:00.243 --> 55:01.299
To save yourself

55:01.382 --> 55:02.966
when you committed
to Twelve Step.

55:04.007 --> 55:08.101
The truth of God didn't do that
for you, you did.

55:08.722 --> 55:09.750
Because deep down,

55:09.833 --> 55:11.976
you actually did know
right from wrong.

55:13.374 --> 55:16.666
I don't care what belief system
you latched onto in recovery.

55:16.749 --> 55:18.273
That doesn't deserve the credit.

55:18.663 --> 55:19.663
You do.

55:20.710 --> 55:23.393
No, the minute you realize that
you will see

55:23.476 --> 55:25.401
that you are accountable
for what you do.

55:25.484 --> 55:26.609
That you're in control.

55:26.835 --> 55:30.283
You know, Zeus 2.0
didn't predetermine your fate

55:30.366 --> 55:32.346
and engrave it
on a golden scroll

55:32.429 --> 55:34.164
on some white
fucking fluffy cloud.

55:34.993 --> 55:36.208
Help me.

55:36.291 --> 55:39.126
Help me find the verse
where it says,

55:39.540 --> 55:42.657
"The Lord's work is to exonerate
the first-class guilt

55:42.740 --> 55:44.091
"of the ruling class."

55:44.550 --> 55:46.024
What would a stripper
know about God?

55:46.107 --> 55:48.771
A lot more than a fucking junkie
that's for sure.

55:52.896 --> 55:53.896
To those men...

55:54.818 --> 55:56.373
I am a goddess.

55:57.474 --> 55:59.295
They come
to my house of worship.

55:59.748 --> 56:01.400
And they see me in the flesh.

56:02.609 --> 56:05.241
They don't need a go-between guy
like you to take their money

56:05.324 --> 56:06.822
so they can reach their deity.

56:10.598 --> 56:11.598
You know...

56:12.277 --> 56:13.487
I do wonder, though.

56:15.315 --> 56:16.315
As you and I...

56:17.315 --> 56:19.667
the goddess and the holy man...

56:20.878 --> 56:22.314
take our money to the bank...

56:23.853 --> 56:25.157
what are we really?

56:29.040 --> 56:30.040
You took my money.

56:34.462 --> 56:35.462
So.

56:36.228 --> 56:38.562
So was the club
where you met your fiancé?

56:38.649 --> 56:39.649
No.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.651
Why wasn't meeting your daughter
part of your recovery?

56:44.734 --> 56:45.734
It is.

56:47.766 --> 56:48.766
It should've been.

56:55.050 --> 56:56.455
I buried the man that I was.

56:57.785 --> 56:59.799
I buried everything about him.

57:01.244 --> 57:02.408
You and your mom.

57:05.947 --> 57:07.627
I denied myself
any pleasure, I...

57:11.678 --> 57:14.411
I punished myself with sobriety.
So that I don't go back--

57:14.494 --> 57:16.763
Do you think
all of your self-punishing

57:16.846 --> 57:18.228
somehow makes me feel better?

57:19.196 --> 57:20.200
I help people--

57:20.283 --> 57:22.981
I use what has helped me
to help other people.

57:23.064 --> 57:24.270
Do you understand?

57:24.353 --> 57:26.439
What the fuck
kind of rationality is that?

57:32.855 --> 57:33.855
Look at me.

57:37.707 --> 57:40.233
Do you think I asked you
because I gave a shit

57:40.316 --> 57:41.316
about the answer?

57:45.113 --> 57:46.113
I said look at me.

57:50.983 --> 57:52.030
You need to say it.

57:53.014 --> 57:54.014
Out loud.

57:54.319 --> 57:55.319
Not for me.

57:57.005 --> 57:58.005
For yourself.

57:59.950 --> 58:00.950
Right now.

58:13.238 --> 58:14.238
I felt...

58:17.212 --> 58:18.212
that if I had...

58:19.072 --> 58:20.072
contacted you...

58:22.025 --> 58:24.084
that it would've made
our relationship real.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.005
That I would've started
something that I couldn't...

58:28.609 --> 58:29.609
maintain.

58:31.687 --> 58:33.203
I hurt so many people.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.430
I didn't want to make
the same mistake with you.

58:36.813 --> 58:37.813
So I ran.

58:43.689 --> 58:45.189
It was selfish, and I'm...

58:47.056 --> 58:48.181
I am truly...

58:49.306 --> 58:50.306
sorry.

58:56.796 --> 58:58.785
How long are you planning
on staying here?

59:00.029 --> 59:01.326
How long do you want me to?

59:02.404 --> 59:05.287
These little talks...
they're nice.

59:06.599 --> 59:07.716
But the truth is...

59:08.435 --> 59:09.505
I don't want you here.

59:10.443 --> 59:12.216
I want you gone. Yesterday.

59:13.920 --> 59:17.918
God, anything I could've--
I could've gained from this

59:18.270 --> 59:20.434
That ship sailed
a long time ago, buddy.

59:23.276 --> 59:25.346
I'll leave if you want me to,
okay, but...

59:27.831 --> 59:29.065
Let me ask you something.

59:38.727 --> 59:39.876
Can I see your daughter?

59:44.134 --> 59:45.134
I'll think about it.

59:49.159 --> 59:50.424
[somber music]

1:01:04.758 --> 1:01:05.912
[muzak playing in store]

1:01:33.032 --> 1:01:34.190
Nice place you got here.

1:01:35.358 --> 1:01:37.902
Must be great to be surrounded
by such beauty as this.

1:01:37.985 --> 1:01:38.985
Pays the bills.

1:01:39.634 --> 1:01:40.993
$21.10 for the bouquet.

1:01:43.885 --> 1:01:44.885
You take cash?

1:01:56.463 --> 1:01:57.464
-[Evelyn] Okay.
-[knocking]

1:01:57.547 --> 1:01:59.852
The sauce... Come in, it's open.

1:02:00.510 --> 1:02:01.713
That's what Mommy does.

1:02:05.528 --> 1:02:06.528
Hi.

1:02:06.903 --> 1:02:08.708
These are for you.
They were your mom's favorite.

1:02:09.559 --> 1:02:11.302
I know. Thank you.

1:02:12.309 --> 1:02:13.786
Hi. It's a nice place.

1:02:14.794 --> 1:02:16.911
Thanks. I've got to put her down
for a nap.

1:02:17.888 --> 1:02:18.888

1:02:39.441 --> 1:02:40.441
Shit.

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:42.120
Can I help you?

1:02:42.792 --> 1:02:43.980
No, I've got it.

1:02:45.316 --> 1:02:47.806
Do you have a vase that
I could put these flowers in?

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:49.401
Yeah, check on top
of the fridge.

1:02:49.484 --> 1:02:51.101
There should be something
up there.

1:02:53.416 --> 1:02:54.416
This'll work.

1:03:02.989 --> 1:03:04.379
So that picture...

1:03:05.354 --> 1:03:06.950
in the hall of your mother
and me.

1:03:07.815 --> 1:03:09.286
Did you get that from your ma?

1:03:10.354 --> 1:03:11.997
Where else would it
have come from?

1:03:15.743 --> 1:03:17.711
It was taken
just before she got pregnant.

1:03:19.274 --> 1:03:20.618
We were trying to get clean.

1:03:21.564 --> 1:03:23.383
We weren't doing a very good job
of it.

1:03:24.882 --> 1:03:25.882
We fantasized...

1:03:26.344 --> 1:03:28.479
about getting married
and that we'd start this--

1:03:28.562 --> 1:03:31.080
Start a rehab facility
to help people like you.

1:03:31.163 --> 1:03:32.163
Yeah, I heard.

1:03:33.796 --> 1:03:36.354
Things don't always work out
the way we want, do they?

1:03:40.818 --> 1:03:43.165
I always remember her eyes.
They were so--

1:03:43.248 --> 1:03:44.602
They were so sweet and warm.

1:03:46.086 --> 1:03:48.946
But even when she smiled,
she still seemed kind of sad.

1:03:51.967 --> 1:03:54.456
One time she told me
that I was the love of her life.

1:03:54.881 --> 1:03:56.666
-And that if she could--
-Time to eat.

1:04:02.770 --> 1:04:03.832
So I was thinking...

1:04:04.731 --> 1:04:08.232
If you keep showing signs
of becoming a better person,

1:04:08.315 --> 1:04:09.315
truly.

1:04:10.502 --> 1:04:12.849
That I'll give you
some of your money back.

1:04:12.932 --> 1:04:14.846
In installments, of course.

Didn't realize
we were having company.

1:04:27.272 --> 1:04:28.830
Are you hungry, I can get you--

1:04:28.913 --> 1:04:30.640
Nope, I got it. All good.

-Hey.
-Hey.

1:04:48.676 --> 1:04:49.886
Did she show you our baby?

1:04:51.137 --> 1:04:52.138
Yeah.

1:04:53.614 --> 1:04:55.433
-Beautiful, right?
-Yeah.

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:56.598
She's gorgeous, yeah.

1:04:58.157 --> 1:05:00.040
-Mm.
-You two should be very proud.

1:05:02.782 --> 1:05:04.887
-So you live here, too.
-No, I live nearby.

1:05:05.668 --> 1:05:06.991
But you're here
all the time, babe.

1:05:07.074 --> 1:05:10.490
He's here all the time,
and we share bills sometimes.

1:05:10.910 --> 1:05:12.965
-Oh. So...
-Yeah.

1:05:13.488 --> 1:05:15.078
What do you do
for a living, Adam?

1:05:16.262 --> 1:05:17.262
[Adam snorts]

1:05:17.574 --> 1:05:18.574
He works on cars.

1:05:22.105 --> 1:05:25.840
Yeah, you ever seen her dance?
She's a hell of a dancer.

1:05:29.051 --> 1:05:30.051
Yeah.

1:05:30.572 --> 1:05:32.713
-She's pretty good.
-Oh yeah.

1:05:34.597 --> 1:05:36.244
That where you two met?
At the club?

1:05:36.327 --> 1:05:37.327
[inaudible]

1:05:38.291 --> 1:05:40.186
-Yeah, it was.
-Do you want some water?

1:05:40.269 --> 1:05:41.354
No, I'm fine.

1:05:41.437 --> 1:05:43.940
-Honey, I can get you water too.
-No, I'm fine. I'm okay.

1:05:44.963 --> 1:05:47.310
I'm actually going
to stop dancing

1:05:47.393 --> 1:05:48.486
in like a month or so.

1:05:48.963 --> 1:05:52.198
As we get closer to moving...
west, so...

1:05:52.549 --> 1:05:54.200
Oh yeah,
you must be really excited

1:05:54.283 --> 1:05:56.661
to move out there,
to get the hell out of dodge.

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:57.744
Yeah.

1:05:59.038 --> 1:06:00.331
Ever been out there, out west?

1:06:01.408 --> 1:06:02.408
-Uh-uh.
-No? Oh.

1:06:02.783 --> 1:06:05.330
It's beautiful. Oh yeah.
You three...

1:06:06.045 --> 1:06:07.046
You'll love it.

1:06:13.225 --> 1:06:14.389
Well, um...

1:06:16.451 --> 1:06:18.173
I should be going.
This has been really great.

1:06:18.256 --> 1:06:20.226
I really thank you
for the dinner. It's...

1:06:22.832 --> 1:06:24.046
Thank you. You're--

1:06:24.129 --> 1:06:26.562
You're very gracious.
Wonderful meeting your baby

1:06:26.645 --> 1:06:27.879
and I'll see you again.

1:06:31.614 --> 1:06:32.614
Thank you guys.

1:06:40.574 --> 1:06:41.574
[dog barking]

1:06:46.377 --> 1:06:47.378
[car ignition starts]

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:04.729
The fuck was he doing here?

1:07:06.585 --> 1:07:07.585
Hm?

1:07:09.552 --> 1:07:11.099
I heard you when I came in.

1:07:12.349 --> 1:07:13.429
Are you seriously thinking

1:07:13.512 --> 1:07:15.073
about giving him
some of his money back?

1:07:16.651 --> 1:07:20.021
That asshole walked around
like you didn't exist

1:07:20.104 --> 1:07:22.038
for your entire life.
Do not forget that.

1:07:23.128 --> 1:07:25.706
Hey, what we took.
It's blood money.

1:07:27.323 --> 1:07:28.323
Do you understand.

1:07:29.794 --> 1:07:31.091
Do you understand?

1:07:35.833 --> 1:07:36.833
Come into the house.

1:07:43.267 --> 1:07:44.267
[suspenseful music]

1:08:16.768 --> 1:08:17.782
[phone vibrates]

1:08:18.353 --> 1:08:20.282
-Hello?
-Rod? Rodney?

1:08:21.332 --> 1:08:22.823
-Rodney?
-Mr. Strathmore.

1:08:23.254 --> 1:08:24.316
Find your daughter?

1:08:24.879 --> 1:08:26.136
Yeah, I did.

1:08:26.660 --> 1:08:29.858
Hey, can you look
into an Adam Wenscombe?

1:08:29.941 --> 1:08:32.148
It's W-E-N-S

1:08:32.233 --> 1:08:34.660
C-O-M-B-E.

1:08:34.952 --> 1:08:37.697
He's engaged to my daughter.

1:08:38.267 --> 1:08:42.645
Sure. In light of your whole
"riches to rags" thing,

1:08:42.728 --> 1:08:43.728
it's on the house.

1:08:44.361 --> 1:08:45.675
Thanks, I appreciate it.

1:08:45.759 --> 1:08:47.246
Call you when I know something.

1:08:56.225 --> 1:08:59.147
[phone vibrating]

1:09:03.261 --> 1:09:04.754
-Hello?
-Did I wake you?

1:09:07.166 --> 1:09:08.246
Doesn't matter.

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:10.737
So your daughter's fiancé, Adam.

1:09:11.268 --> 1:09:13.282
-Yeah.
-He's real bad news, man.

1:09:13.901 --> 1:09:16.307
I'm no life coach,
but here's my two cents.

1:09:16.987 --> 1:09:18.607
If you care about your daughter,

1:09:18.689 --> 1:09:20.518
I'd intervene in that shit
right quick.

1:09:20.939 --> 1:09:23.760
-What can you tell me about him?
-Been in and out of rehab.

1:09:24.057 --> 1:09:25.671
Possession and dealing.

1:09:25.755 --> 1:09:27.403
A few B&Es. The works.

1:09:27.832 --> 1:09:29.350
Guy's worse on paper than you.

1:09:29.434 --> 1:09:30.434
[suspenseful music]

1:09:37.491 --> 1:09:39.358
[dogs barking]

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:47.906
[knocking] Evelyn.

1:09:48.296 --> 1:09:50.508
Evelyn, this is Donovan.

1:09:52.350 --> 1:09:53.898
Can I speak to you for a second?

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:03.991
What happened?

1:10:08.754 --> 1:10:09.754
Come in.

1:10:12.902 --> 1:10:13.902
[door slams]

1:10:14.675 --> 1:10:15.675
[lock clicks]

1:10:24.244 --> 1:10:26.180
What the fuck
are you still doing around?

1:10:26.263 --> 1:10:27.557
I couldn't leave you again.

1:10:29.273 --> 1:10:30.273
Now what happened?

1:10:31.985 --> 1:10:32.985
Adam.

1:10:37.436 --> 1:10:39.181
He came by
with some of his friends

1:10:39.264 --> 1:10:40.514
coked out of his mind.

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:44.421
And he forced me to transfer
the money, all of it.

1:10:46.513 --> 1:10:47.513
[sniffs]

1:10:47.911 --> 1:10:49.412
I thought we were going to go--

1:10:50.388 --> 1:10:51.388
I thought-- [sobs]

1:10:55.920 --> 1:10:56.920
Is...

1:10:57.717 --> 1:10:58.998
Is Maureen alright?

1:11:01.529 --> 1:11:02.529
Yeah? Here.

1:11:04.677 --> 1:11:05.687
Thank you.

1:11:09.952 --> 1:11:11.351
Tell me how I can find him.

1:11:15.858 --> 1:11:17.334
He's probably at his friend's.

1:11:18.733 --> 1:11:21.360
If they haven't left town yet,
they're getting ready to.

1:11:25.379 --> 1:11:26.379
Why would he do this?

1:11:27.028 --> 1:11:28.379
[sighs] Fuck.

1:11:31.065 --> 1:11:32.728
He owed some money
to some people.

1:11:34.112 --> 1:11:36.541
And he promised me
that he would pay them off.

1:11:36.978 --> 1:11:38.635
And then
we'd move west together.

1:11:41.001 --> 1:11:43.341
But he was so mad.

1:11:44.243 --> 1:11:45.907
He was furious,
you know, and he...

1:11:46.892 --> 1:11:48.619
He'd heard me tell you that...

1:11:48.702 --> 1:11:50.764
I wanted to give you
some of the money back.

1:11:58.076 --> 1:11:59.309
Now you listen to me.

1:12:01.809 --> 1:12:03.371
None of this is your fault.

1:12:04.987 --> 1:12:05.987
Okay?

1:12:11.058 --> 1:12:12.464
Tell me where I can find him.

1:12:17.933 --> 1:12:20.335
If he's still in the state,
he's at his friend's.

1:12:22.791 --> 1:12:24.958
-233 Michigan.
-233.

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:27.861
-It's a green house.
-You and the baby safe here?

1:12:29.018 --> 1:12:31.138
No reason for him
to come back now, is there?

1:12:31.705 --> 1:12:33.057
Well let's hope that's true.

1:12:37.221 --> 1:12:38.478
Okay, look, you stay here.

1:12:40.038 --> 1:12:42.009
You call the cops if you have to

1:12:42.092 --> 1:12:43.967
and I will find a--
Oh and, um...

1:12:45.236 --> 1:12:46.260
Don't open that door.

1:12:46.343 --> 1:12:48.818
You barricade it
with a chair or table, whatever.

1:12:50.882 --> 1:12:52.639
Evelyn. You got it?

1:12:53.875 --> 1:12:55.617
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1:12:59.763 --> 1:13:00.763
[door slams]

1:13:05.771 --> 1:13:06.771
[faint hip-hop beats]

1:13:24.393 --> 1:13:26.206
Guys, I think we need to get...

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:29.177
we need to hurry this up, okay?

1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:31.949
What's the fucking rush?
We have all these fucking drugs.

1:13:32.956 --> 1:13:35.002
You paid them off. We're rich.

1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:37.038
We can do anything we want.

1:13:37.627 --> 1:13:38.839
We should celebrate.

1:13:38.922 --> 1:13:40.151
Yeah we can celebrate

1:13:40.549 --> 1:13:42.380
when we get maybe
the fuck out of here, alright?

1:13:42.463 --> 1:13:43.463
What is the rush?

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:49.175
The fuck are you doing here?

1:13:50.728 --> 1:13:52.181
Getting my daughter back
her money.

1:13:52.572 --> 1:13:54.150
She has your baby
to take care of.

1:13:55.267 --> 1:13:56.267
[laughs]

1:13:56.931 --> 1:13:58.259
Oh that's funny.

1:13:58.861 --> 1:14:00.311
-Coming from you.
-Yeah.

1:14:00.759 --> 1:14:02.442
You beat up an innocent woman.

1:14:02.525 --> 1:14:03.939
Took everything that she has.

1:14:04.541 --> 1:14:06.424
And now
you're about to abandon her?

1:14:07.735 --> 1:14:09.028
You think when you get
where you're going

1:14:09.111 --> 1:14:10.321
you're going to be happy?

1:14:11.025 --> 1:14:12.955
The guilt will eat you up.
I promise you.

1:14:13.594 --> 1:14:15.344
We had plans for that money.

1:14:16.118 --> 1:14:18.538
Hey? Until you came along
and fucked everything up.

1:14:18.621 --> 1:14:20.511
Adam, come on.
Just listen to me please.

1:14:21.246 --> 1:14:22.379
None of this is for me.

1:14:22.959 --> 1:14:25.196
Just give her some of the money
so she can live for a while,

1:14:25.279 --> 1:14:26.963
if you're going to leave her
and Maureen.

1:14:28.216 --> 1:14:29.216
Adam.

1:14:30.132 --> 1:14:32.134
It's never too late
to choose to be a good man.

1:14:32.505 --> 1:14:34.428
[laughs]

1:14:37.924 --> 1:14:39.183
[Adam's friend] Good man?

1:14:39.266 --> 1:14:40.266
[laughter continues]

1:14:41.464 --> 1:14:43.901
It's not too late,
Adam [laughs].

1:14:44.271 --> 1:14:45.646
You really going
to let this old fuck

1:14:45.728 --> 1:14:46.941
tell you what to do, bro?

1:14:49.026 --> 1:14:51.420
The fuck are you waiting for?
Kick his fucking ass.

1:14:51.503 --> 1:14:52.503
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:14:53.568 --> 1:14:55.116
You need to leave. Right now.

1:14:55.678 --> 1:14:57.243
Not until I get what I came for.

1:14:58.553 --> 1:15:00.556
Don't be such a pussy, Adam.

1:15:00.639 --> 1:15:02.248
Give him
what he fucking came for

1:15:02.331 --> 1:15:04.014
and beat his fucking ass.

1:15:04.097 --> 1:15:05.978
Yeah, don't fucking wait.
Stop standing there.

1:15:06.061 --> 1:15:07.618
Make a fucking move, Adam.

1:15:07.701 --> 1:15:09.764
-Shut up!
-Fucking hit him.

1:15:10.467 --> 1:15:11.467
Hit him!

1:15:12.091 --> 1:15:13.718
Put him
in a fucking wheelchair, Adam.

1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.099
You remind me of something.

1:15:21.035 --> 1:15:23.480
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Me when I was younger.

1:15:24.105 --> 1:15:25.896
-Fucking hit him.
-Come on.

1:15:25.978 --> 1:15:27.023
[intense music]

1:15:30.370 --> 1:15:31.370
[impact]

1:15:33.206 --> 1:15:34.655
[thuds]

1:15:39.504 --> 1:15:40.911
We should hit the road, guys.

1:15:40.994 --> 1:15:42.364
[Donovan gasping]

1:15:45.934 --> 1:15:47.334
Got a long ways ahead of us.

1:15:47.921 --> 1:15:49.225
And who knows

1:15:49.943 --> 1:15:51.514
if Sergeant Badass over here...

1:15:53.468 --> 1:15:54.905
came to call the cops on us.

1:16:02.639 --> 1:16:04.179
-[groans]
-What else you got?

1:16:08.038 --> 1:16:09.038
Thanks.

1:16:09.843 --> 1:16:10.843
Let's go.

1:16:14.519 --> 1:16:16.715
[footsteps]

1:16:41.150 --> 1:16:42.150
[groans]

1:17:16.713 --> 1:17:17.800
[high-pitched tone]

1:17:37.903 --> 1:17:39.629
[breathing heavily]

1:17:42.387 --> 1:17:43.387
[groans]

1:17:45.050 --> 1:17:46.520
[knocking at door]

1:17:47.817 --> 1:17:49.348
Evelyn? [coughs]

1:17:50.371 --> 1:17:53.223
Evelyn [knocks]. It's Donovan.

1:17:59.161 --> 1:18:00.161
It's Donovan.

1:18:02.434 --> 1:18:03.661
-Oh my God.
-[groans]

1:18:04.528 --> 1:18:05.940
It's okay.

1:18:16.014 --> 1:18:17.525
Oh God. It hurts.

1:18:17.608 --> 1:18:19.585
-I know. I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1:18:23.733 --> 1:18:25.816
I can't believe you walked
all the way here.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:28.717
They took my car and my phone.

1:18:36.923 --> 1:18:38.416
-Thank you for...
-Yeah.

1:18:41.639 --> 1:18:43.992
Did he get all your money?

1:18:46.827 --> 1:18:47.827
Oh no.

1:18:48.593 --> 1:18:50.643
Why can't you just hack him
and get it back.

1:18:51.843 --> 1:18:53.750
Because he's a better hacker
than I am.

1:18:55.898 --> 1:18:56.898
I mean...

1:19:00.491 --> 1:19:01.967
It's gone, Dad, it's gone.

1:19:07.733 --> 1:19:09.934
You-- you just called me Dad.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:20.760
You have...

1:19:23.534 --> 1:19:25.190
You have your mother's eyes.

1:19:55.965 --> 1:19:57.433
[laughs]

1:20:01.744 --> 1:20:03.775
[continues laughing]

1:20:04.307 --> 1:20:05.307
[baby squawks]

1:20:07.713 --> 1:20:08.713
[continues laughing]

1:20:12.641 --> 1:20:13.860
[she chuckles]

1:20:24.475 --> 1:20:26.092
[sighs deeply]
