That's right.

01:49:23.974 --> 01:49:26.684
Mr. McFly! Mr. McFly,
this just arrived.

01:49:26.769 --> 01:49:29.562
Oh, hi, Marty.
I think it's your
new book.

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:35.985
Honey!
Your first novel.

01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:37.111
GEORGE: Like I've
always told you,

01:49:37.196 --> 01:49:40.114
you put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

01:49:40.199 --> 01:49:42.700
Oh, Marty,
here's your keys.

01:49:42.785 --> 01:49:44.577
You're all waxed up,
ready for tonight.

01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:46.329
Keys?

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:04.305
How about a ride,
mister?

01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:05.515
Jennifer.

01:50:06.475 --> 01:50:10.603
Oh, are you a sight
for sore eyes!
Let me look at you.

01:50:11.355 --> 01:50:14.232
Marty, you're acting
like you haven't
seen me in a week.

01:50:14.316 --> 01:50:15.733
I haven't.

01:50:16.318 --> 01:50:19.570
You okay?
Is everything all right?

01:50:22.866 --> 01:50:23.992
MARTY: Oh, yeah.

01:50:26.203 --> 01:50:27.996
Everything is great.

01:50:42.219 --> 01:50:46.472
Marty!
You've got to come
back with me!

01:50:47.266 --> 01:50:48.474
Where?

01:50:48.559 --> 01:50:49.726
Back to the future.

01:50:54.356 --> 01:50:56.482
Wait a minute.
What are you doing, Doc?

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:58.568
I need fuel.

01:51:02.031 --> 01:51:04.449
Go ahead. Quick!
Get in the car.

01:51:04.533 --> 01:51:06.576
No, no. Doc,
I just got here, okay?

01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.661
Jennifer's here.
We're gonna take
the new truck for a spin.

01:51:08.746 --> 01:51:11.998
Well, bring her along.
This concerns her, too.

01:51:12.082 --> 01:51:13.666
Wait a minute, Doc.
What are you
talking about?

01:51:13.751 --> 01:51:15.793
What happens to us
in the future?

01:51:15.878 --> 01:51:17.628
Do we become assholes
or something?

01:51:17.713 --> 01:51:18.838
No, no, no,
no, Marty.

01:51:18.922 --> 01:51:20.673
Both you and Jennifer
turn out fine.

01:51:20.758 --> 01:51:22.216
It's your kids, Marty.

01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:24.552
Something has
got to be done
about your kids.

01:51:30.934 --> 01:51:34.020
Hey, Doc, we better back up.
We don't have enough
road to get up to 88.

01:51:34.104 --> 01:51:38.274
Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads.
