00:42.771 --> 00:44.628
{pub}You new in town?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.578
Yeah.

00:52.955 --> 00:55.055
You lookin' for work?

00:57.498 --> 01:02.270
I'm lookin' to do a job on the rail road.

01:07.351 --> 01:09.569
We'll ride in ones and twos,

01:10.027 --> 01:11.232
Morgan here, Burtee here,

01:11.357 --> 01:14.449
you got the sawmill, you watch
the saloon and the whorehouse.

01:17.303 --> 01:19.642
You wanna have another go?

01:33.176 --> 01:35.762
And, Dennis,
you take care of the boxcar guard.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.372
Jimmy, you watch from the restaurant.

01:37.397 --> 01:40.517
Me, Fitz, and Louie, we'll take the office.

01:50.182 --> 01:51.358
Ma'am.

01:51.483 --> 01:52.951
Ma'am.

01:59.493 --> 02:02.706
Just a blonde girl and a pencil
dick with 50,000 in the safe.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.749
When them Yankee bastards is out,

02:04.874 --> 02:06.419
we slip in and take their payroll.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.919
Easier'n butter's greasy, boys.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.797
The one guard all we got to worry about?

02:10.963 --> 02:14.551
You remember that nigger guard
on the train with the gun?

02:14.717 --> 02:16.219
The one that buffaloed Bohannon?

02:21.515 --> 02:24.377
Strutting around like
a big old black rooster.

02:24.502 --> 02:27.397
I knew somethin' weren't
right with him and Bohannon.

02:27.563 --> 02:32.611
And get this, Bohannon himself
is working on the rail road.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.237
Druther not run into no Bohannon.

02:34.403 --> 02:37.074
Shit, I ain't worried.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.868
Besides, he'll be miles away

02:40.034 --> 02:41.912
when we take that 50,000.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.080
Cullen's alive?

02:45.196 --> 02:47.959
Y'all secure them brakes this time.

02:50.962 --> 02:55.375
He's walkin' the streets
like the risen Christ.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.874
{pub}Together, Mr. Toole...
And heave!

04:17.999 --> 04:19.041
Pull!

04:19.166 --> 04:19.968
Heave...

04:20.402 --> 04:21.546
Pull!

04:21.671 --> 04:23.388
Heave...
Pull!

04:23.554 --> 04:25.849
Heave...
Pull!

04:26.015 --> 04:29.311
One more time, we'll have this
son of a whore in the air, heave!

04:29.477 --> 04:31.521
Pull!

04:35.524 --> 04:36.776
All right!

04:38.192 --> 04:39.468
That a way, lads!

04:39.593 --> 04:40.989
We got her done!

04:41.155 --> 04:43.283
Good job!

04:43.449 --> 04:44.607
Good work, Mr. Toole.

04:44.732 --> 04:47.568
You as well, Mr. Bohannon.

04:49.121 --> 04:51.347
All right. Let's shore her up

04:51.472 --> 04:53.668
and raise her sister by
the end of the day, all right?

04:57.809 --> 05:00.956
A huntin' dog looked at me
just like that one time.

05:01.081 --> 05:04.304
It can be done, Mr. Toole.

05:07.219 --> 05:08.994
All right, enough of the peckerplay!

05:09.119 --> 05:11.096
We got another one to raise!

05:11.221 --> 05:12.646
All right, sir!

05:18.628 --> 05:21.238
Leave off wearing any rebel garb, boys.

05:21.404 --> 05:24.115
Let's not draw eyes on ourselves.

05:24.281 --> 05:26.713
Doc, come here.

05:31.576 --> 05:34.042
Where you think you're going?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.176
It's the last job, right?

05:36.585 --> 05:39.589
Well, I need you here to patch up
anybody that might need patching up.

05:39.755 --> 05:40.991
I'd just as soon ride along on this one

05:41.016 --> 05:43.125
if it's all the same to you.

05:43.250 --> 05:47.702
You got notions of riding in
and warnin' your Mississippi friend,

05:47.827 --> 05:49.933
that ain't going
to end well for him or you.

05:54.353 --> 05:58.775
I wish you'd tell me what's on your mind.

06:00.797 --> 06:02.740
I've been thinking about...

06:02.865 --> 06:05.707
What I'll do with myself
once we reach the Pacific.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.977
The Pacific?

06:08.102 --> 06:11.121
I've hardly thought past the gorge.

06:11.287 --> 06:17.352
Knowing you, you've already
written your victory speech.

06:17.477 --> 06:21.131
Yes, there will be speeches
and deals to be made.

06:21.297 --> 06:24.050
And then you'll return to New York.

06:24.281 --> 06:25.677
Well, New York is my home.

06:27.352 --> 06:31.641
I was just wondering...
What will become of me.

06:36.123 --> 06:38.459
See you later.

07:02.916 --> 07:05.675
Good morning, Reverend.

07:08.518 --> 07:12.198
I have made us some strong coffee...

07:12.323 --> 07:17.602
Uhh! And a nice
hardtack biscuit! Uhh!

07:17.727 --> 07:20.148
I trust you slept well, huh?

07:20.314 --> 07:22.042
Just... just one drink.

07:22.167 --> 07:25.615
Oh, you are like the duck
in the song the Negroes sing.

07:25.740 --> 07:26.917
If the river were whiskey,

07:27.042 --> 07:30.513
you would dive in and never come up, huh?

07:32.159 --> 07:33.990
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:34.115 --> 07:35.557
I don't want to do this any longer.

07:35.682 --> 07:37.624
Good! You made me promise
to keep you locked up,

07:37.749 --> 07:39.661
especially when you made such declarations.

07:39.786 --> 07:43.835
But I mean it now.
As I meant it then!

07:43.960 --> 07:45.527
Sit.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.431
I can't go on.

07:53.597 --> 07:57.769
Ohh.

07:58.043 --> 08:03.362
When you have taken strength
from your breakfast, huh?

08:03.487 --> 08:07.290
Perhaps you can
finish your manifesto. Huh?

08:08.658 --> 08:10.365
No one...
No one cares about that.

08:10.727 --> 08:12.604
You were finishing point five

08:12.729 --> 08:16.475
of the white man's predilection
for racial eradication.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.069
Lovely writing, I must say.

08:19.623 --> 08:22.280
Passionate without unnecessary histrionics.

08:22.405 --> 08:28.258
Though I believe there
is an "a" in vengeance.

08:50.094 --> 08:51.906
You all right, ma'am?

08:52.072 --> 08:55.952
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.533
My pleasure.

10:22.927 --> 10:25.004
A bottle.

10:25.129 --> 10:27.774
You gonna pay for that?

10:27.899 --> 10:29.170
Put it on my tab.

10:29.336 --> 10:32.173
Ain't no more room on your tab.

10:32.339 --> 10:36.010
You best find some room.

10:42.933 --> 10:43.768
Yeah. I-I-I...

10:43.934 --> 10:46.399
Rye.
Be right there.

10:46.524 --> 10:47.981
Ahem.

10:55.169 --> 10:56.313
I said rye.

10:56.438 --> 10:59.200
All right. Here.

11:03.984 --> 11:07.354
So you let niggers drink in here?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.716
What you looking at, boy?

11:18.051 --> 11:20.708
Trash got a name?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.812
Or you just go by "Trash?"

11:22.937 --> 11:25.682
Now, Mr. Ferguson,
I don't want no more shooting from you.

11:25.807 --> 11:28.104
Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson?

11:31.607 --> 11:33.276
Now, that's pretty funny.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.237
Where you get that pistol, Mr. Trash?

11:39.426 --> 11:41.075
This one here?

11:41.241 --> 11:44.871
Touch it and I'll blow your head off.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.914
Cease fire, gents!

11:49.082 --> 11:50.176
My friend here,

11:50.301 --> 11:54.606
he gets his neck up when
he's drinkin', I apologize.

11:57.211 --> 12:00.591
Perhaps you'll allow me to buy
this negro gentleman a drink.

12:00.716 --> 12:03.014
He usually drinks a bottle.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.224
A bottle it is, then.

12:05.390 --> 12:09.354
We are leaving and want no trouble.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.604
Yeah.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.800
Good day to ya.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.072
Well, there's two more customers

12:19.238 --> 12:21.616
you've done me out of, Mr. Ferguson.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.411
You're breaking me!

12:25.577 --> 12:28.450
And don't come back!

12:35.095 --> 12:36.881
The last time I saw that Griswold

12:37.047 --> 12:38.544
Cullen Bohannon was pointing it in my face.

12:38.669 --> 12:41.344
It's a common sidearm
among the Southerners.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.476
It might be the Southerners
that's robbing your trains.

12:43.601 --> 12:45.453
You recognize them from the robbery?

12:45.578 --> 12:47.578
No, sir. But I got a
feeling something's up.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.193
How so?

12:49.318 --> 12:51.128
Payroll come same day they show up?

12:51.253 --> 12:53.164
Two white rebels buying
a black man a drink?

12:53.289 --> 12:55.155
That ain't right.

12:56.623 --> 12:59.696
Arm whoever's in town and post
them by the rail road office.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.615
Nobody in town 'cept
shopkeepers and sick list.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.403
Well, arm them.

13:04.528 --> 13:05.868
Yes, sir!

13:06.034 --> 13:11.040
Oh, and send a fast rider
to fetch Bohannon.

13:12.703 --> 13:14.868
Yes, sir.

13:25.613 --> 13:27.422
I understand that, but it's got to be...

13:27.547 --> 13:30.424
You two. Come with me.

13:30.549 --> 13:32.495
Mr. Ferguson...

13:32.620 --> 13:33.897
What can we do for you?

13:34.022 --> 13:35.566
You need rifles.
Come on.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.608
Rifles?

13:37.774 --> 13:38.503
It's the Germans.

13:38.628 --> 13:40.778
Nah. There's gonna be some trouble.

13:40.944 --> 13:42.741
I need men who will kill.

13:42.866 --> 13:44.300
Stop!

13:46.405 --> 13:50.318
Then why you comin' to us?
We're not riflemen.

13:50.443 --> 13:53.166
Yeah, we're businessmen, we're not killers.

13:53.332 --> 13:56.878
Today you be what I say you be.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.155
Come on.

14:09.556 --> 14:10.808
Damn.

14:10.974 --> 14:14.645
Carl's got guns under
the bar. Go get 'em.

14:14.811 --> 14:16.647
Right.
Go get 'em!

14:16.772 --> 14:18.524
Go get 'em now!

14:25.417 --> 14:27.200
I see you on the sick list again.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.036
I'll be back out there tomorrow.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.830
I need you help today though.

14:32.996 --> 14:34.836
You don't need me.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.668
Look, them Johnny Rebs
been robbin' the train.

14:37.834 --> 14:40.274
They in town.

14:40.399 --> 14:42.242
Might be here to steal the payroll.

14:42.367 --> 14:43.508
I need your help.

14:52.106 --> 14:54.644
I don't think I'm up for it.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.084
Can you just cover the West road?

14:56.209 --> 14:57.754
In case they make a run for it?

14:57.879 --> 14:59.774
No!

15:13.467 --> 15:15.713
Lily!

15:15.838 --> 15:18.251
I think you should go back to your car.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.186
What has happened?

15:20.311 --> 15:22.119
Aah!
This here is happening.

15:22.244 --> 15:24.715
All right, blondie, get over
here and open up that safe.

15:24.881 --> 15:25.800
Don't do it, lily.

15:25.966 --> 15:26.889
And who are you?

15:27.014 --> 15:28.261
Thomas Durant.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.597
This is my rail road,
and that is my payroll.

15:31.763 --> 15:33.962
Well, not much longer it ain't.

15:34.087 --> 15:35.309
Go on. Get over here.

15:35.475 --> 15:37.103
Aah! Stop it!

15:39.111 --> 15:40.022
Aah!

15:40.663 --> 15:44.277
Aah! No! Thomas!

15:44.443 --> 15:45.862
Ah!

15:48.071 --> 15:50.491
Get over here and open that damn safe!

15:50.657 --> 15:51.659
Please! Please!

15:51.939 --> 15:53.415
Open it!

16:05.929 --> 16:07.239
{pub}I heard gunshots.

16:07.364 --> 16:08.640
I know.

16:08.765 --> 16:10.041
Use Durant's telegraph,

16:10.166 --> 16:11.876
tell the fort we being robbed by rebels.

16:12.001 --> 16:13.647
The fort's too far away to help.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.085
Whatever happens, somebody
need to know who done it.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.317
Whoa.

16:29.186 --> 16:30.829
You ladies get back
inside! You wanna die?

16:30.954 --> 16:33.075
Get your ass back inside that tent!

16:33.291 --> 16:34.493
You move now!
Get inside!

16:50.544 --> 16:52.821
Woman, if you don't open this safe,

16:52.946 --> 16:55.089
we will finish off the old
man, do you understand me?

16:55.214 --> 16:57.826
Yes. Yes.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.435
Open the safe!

16:59.601 --> 17:01.854
I can't think with that!

17:15.067 --> 17:16.285
Ooh!

17:16.451 --> 17:17.878
Oh!

17:20.747 --> 17:21.886
Come on now.

17:22.011 --> 17:23.959
Take a deep breath.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.699
Ahh. Aah!

17:31.824 --> 17:33.534
Come on, get out of the way. Go on!

17:33.659 --> 17:34.802
Bring that bag!

17:34.927 --> 17:37.223
Come on, fill it up.
Get them coins, too!

17:38.598 --> 17:40.833
Come on, hurry now!

17:42.670 --> 17:44.203
Unh!

17:54.990 --> 17:57.267
You are a felon!

17:57.534 --> 18:00.788
Let's go.

18:09.412 --> 18:11.083
Aah!

18:12.120 --> 18:14.264
Oh! Damn it, it's Bohannon!

18:14.389 --> 18:15.698
Son of a bitch, grab that money!

18:15.823 --> 18:17.692
Come on!

18:37.824 --> 18:40.244
Hey, Dennis!

18:51.451 --> 18:53.029
Here we go.

18:53.154 --> 18:54.898
You got you some nice friends.

18:55.023 --> 18:58.264
Ain't much fun killin' 'em,
but they seem to need it.

18:58.389 --> 19:00.233
True words.

19:00.358 --> 19:02.502
Let's do it.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.354
Reverend!

19:22.479 --> 19:24.288
Listen...

19:24.413 --> 19:26.082
Do you hear that?

19:27.783 --> 19:28.860
It's thunder.

19:28.985 --> 19:31.065
No, no, no, much sweeter sound.

19:31.190 --> 19:32.463
Trumpets.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.554
Damn it.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.703
Trumpets announcing
the breaking of the seals.

19:44.828 --> 19:46.798
Your prophecy.

19:53.709 --> 19:55.861
Hyah! Hyah!

19:56.027 --> 19:57.359
Ohh!

19:57.484 --> 19:59.329
Unh!

20:00.656 --> 20:01.826
Ahh.

20:04.657 --> 20:06.623
Ooh!

20:14.400 --> 20:16.076
No! No! Get back!

20:16.201 --> 20:18.175
Oh!

20:27.183 --> 20:28.394
Uh!

20:29.728 --> 20:31.078
Uh!

20:32.314 --> 20:33.681
Uh!

21:01.837 --> 21:02.720
Aah!

21:12.103 --> 21:14.090
Come on.

21:14.215 --> 21:16.108
Come on!

21:19.517 --> 21:21.283
Come on!

21:24.783 --> 21:27.453
I got you now, boy.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.913
I got you now!

21:31.957 --> 21:32.875
Aah!

21:33.226 --> 21:35.336
Aah!

21:36.628 --> 21:38.059
Thomas.

21:40.027 --> 21:41.842
Thomas!

21:43.199 --> 21:44.482
Hey, hey! Yeah.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.778
You wouldn't kill one of your own,

21:45.903 --> 21:47.348
unarmed and injured, now, would you?

21:47.514 --> 21:50.142
Heh!

21:50.308 --> 21:52.478
Someone help!

21:52.644 --> 21:55.613
Mr. Durant is dying!

21:55.897 --> 21:57.608
Where's doc?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.322
Uh. Aah!

22:03.488 --> 22:04.823
Help!

22:04.989 --> 22:07.076
- Aah!
- Tell me where is he, you son of a bitch.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.618
Hellfire, Bohannon.

22:09.743 --> 22:11.956
River camp, two miles East.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.684
Lock his ass in the pig car, I'll be back.

22:19.313 --> 22:21.298
Get your ass up, boy.

22:21.464 --> 22:23.723
Get up!

22:41.800 --> 22:42.992
{pub}Let's use this.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.157
What is it?

22:47.323 --> 22:49.209
Rag of Clay and black mustard.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.704
Indian trick.

22:51.870 --> 22:55.251
I done my share of midwife-ing,

22:55.376 --> 22:57.376
first thing, we gotta stop the bleeding.

23:07.635 --> 23:09.221
Thank you.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.513
I need water.

23:14.638 --> 23:16.514
Get on up in there.

23:16.639 --> 23:18.183
Maybe I get you some.

23:19.877 --> 23:21.775
OK. OK, OK. Come on.

23:22.438 --> 23:23.213
Water.

23:23.976 --> 23:24.928
Water.
I need some water.

23:25.651 --> 23:27.913
Damn it. Water.

23:31.267 --> 23:32.953
Please.

23:49.363 --> 23:52.367
Ohh.

23:57.439 --> 23:59.150
Here.

23:59.275 --> 24:01.732
Fresh and still cool from the rain.

24:07.149 --> 24:09.283
Ha.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.539
Damn, Cullen.
I can't believe...

24:58.705 --> 25:00.749
There's people hurt.
Grab your bags. Mount up.

25:00.915 --> 25:03.578
- Well, where's...
- All of 'em's dead, except Hawkins.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.170
Let's go!

25:30.156 --> 25:31.321
No.

25:33.191 --> 25:35.767
Uh... hands up like that.

25:35.892 --> 25:37.735
Angels looking to heaven.

25:37.860 --> 25:41.206
Just get going a little
bit more for the picture.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.207
Oh, sir, may I photograph you

25:44.332 --> 25:47.421
looking sorrowfully at this dead whore?

25:48.703 --> 25:51.091
Get the hell out of here.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.272
Get back to work!

26:05.666 --> 26:06.776
Move it!

26:13.609 --> 26:15.778
Move the hell out the way.

26:27.098 --> 26:28.921
Clear that table.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.346
Do it.

26:31.471 --> 26:35.441
Cullen, help me get him up there.

26:36.643 --> 26:38.810
1, 2, 3.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.618
Who is this?

27:01.743 --> 27:04.248
He's a doctor.
That's all you need to know.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.044
Are we too late?

27:23.516 --> 27:25.048
Hold him down, for Christ sakes.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.397
Shh, shh.

28:10.453 --> 28:12.565
{pub}I feel ashamed.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.024
You done everything you could.

28:16.692 --> 28:21.641
For a moment, I felt...

28:21.766 --> 28:25.032
Relief that he might not live.

28:28.135 --> 28:31.749
You yourself would be free...

28:31.874 --> 28:34.129
From your debt to the rail road.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.092
Ohh.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.469
He ain't dead yet.

28:42.718 --> 28:45.861
I should telegraph his wife.

28:45.986 --> 28:47.392
She should know.

28:55.825 --> 28:58.501
He needs a more qualified surgeon, ma'am,

28:58.626 --> 29:00.656
not some battlefield sawbones like me.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.532
If I'd run across him like this in the war,

29:02.698 --> 29:05.266
I would have moved on to the next man.

29:05.391 --> 29:07.878
You best do everything in
your power to keep him alive.

29:08.003 --> 29:10.874
He needs to be opened up, Cullen.

29:11.040 --> 29:14.654
That bullet ripped up his insides,
it's lodged against his spine.

29:14.779 --> 29:17.087
I don't have the tools or the expertise.

29:17.212 --> 29:19.591
Can we take him to Chicago?

29:19.757 --> 29:22.511
The ride will probably kill him.

29:25.683 --> 29:28.084
I'm doing all I can.

29:29.684 --> 29:34.239
Ya couldn't have just ridden
on to Mexico, could you?

29:34.364 --> 29:36.639
I tried to tell you,
Cullen, a hundred times...

29:36.764 --> 29:38.139
Uh-uh, no. Uh-uh.

29:38.264 --> 29:42.739
'Cause there never was
any Mexico, was there?

29:42.905 --> 29:44.737
Was there, doc?

29:56.783 --> 29:58.088
Look what I found.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.360
Good.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.146
Put 'em on.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.636
Hey!

30:30.761 --> 30:31.771
Hey, where are we going?

30:31.896 --> 30:33.396
You'll find out soon.

30:41.107 --> 30:44.290
This ain't right.
This ain't right.

30:44.415 --> 30:46.292
This ain't fair.

30:46.417 --> 30:49.197
I ain't done nothin'
you ain't done, Bohannon!

30:49.322 --> 30:53.894
Nothin'! You hear me
talkin' to you, boy?

30:59.164 --> 31:00.842
I get a trial.

31:00.967 --> 31:03.345
You can't execute a man
without trying him first.

31:03.470 --> 31:05.148
That's the law.

31:05.273 --> 31:06.916
We still got laws!

31:07.041 --> 31:09.019
The president of
the United States has spoke.

31:09.144 --> 31:11.161
We still got laws!

31:20.225 --> 31:22.227
Ah!

31:33.972 --> 31:38.676
You was with that rail road
the whole time, wasn't ya?

31:40.690 --> 31:43.235
Look at me, damn ya.

31:47.238 --> 31:50.256
How'd you end up with
these Yankee bastards, anyhow?

31:51.492 --> 31:53.745
Why you here?

31:55.695 --> 31:58.166
You want to say your last words?

32:00.903 --> 32:02.904
Yeah.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.276
I do.

32:12.549 --> 32:14.894
You're a coward, Bohannon.

32:15.019 --> 32:17.921
You're yella and I always knowed it.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.846
You betrayed your country,
son, and everyone in it.

32:28.233 --> 32:30.401
Heh.

32:41.145 --> 32:42.688
I know something was squirrelly

32:42.813 --> 32:45.092
when you let this here
nigger get the drop on you.

32:45.217 --> 32:46.339
But...

32:48.023 --> 32:50.333
I ain't never figured you
for no nigger lover.

32:56.098 --> 32:58.301
Damn it, Elam, the man wasn't done

33:55.442 --> 33:57.285
{pub}You're awake.

33:58.713 --> 34:00.015
How's the pain?

34:02.540 --> 34:05.961
I've got some tincture
of opium if you'd like.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.690
N-no.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.158
It would help you sleep.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.327
Uh... no. No.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.985
Can you feel your leg?

34:30.150 --> 34:33.487
No.

34:36.016 --> 34:39.130
Mr. Durant, I know you're a doctor,

34:39.255 --> 34:41.496
so I'm gonna give it to you straight.

34:41.661 --> 34:45.001
The bullet, it ruptured your spleen,

34:45.126 --> 34:46.804
is probably lodged against your spine.

34:46.929 --> 34:48.909
I think it nicked the lineal artery,

34:49.034 --> 34:51.844
but I'm sorry, sir,

34:51.969 --> 34:56.344
I don't have the means
to get in there and fix it.

34:58.773 --> 35:00.223
What do we do?

35:07.116 --> 35:09.357
The bleeding's slowing down.

35:11.155 --> 35:12.861
He's got a stout heart.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.907
I'd risk a train ride.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.836
Yes, sir.

35:30.983 --> 35:33.089
Ah.

35:37.593 --> 35:40.053
Storslatte.

35:52.197 --> 35:54.486
You're handsome.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.073
Thank you, Thor.

35:58.239 --> 36:00.283
Hmm.

36:00.449 --> 36:04.037
But... why?

36:04.203 --> 36:06.956
Why?

36:07.122 --> 36:11.044
Why did you save me?

36:15.287 --> 36:17.691
Come and see.

36:18.927 --> 36:22.003
Come. Come. Come,
come, come, come, come.

36:22.128 --> 36:24.698
Come, come, come, come.

36:26.268 --> 36:28.683
The lord, holy and true,

36:28.808 --> 36:31.523
has saved you, Reverend, not me.

36:37.312 --> 36:40.826
To judge and avenge in
the name of the dissipated,

36:40.951 --> 36:45.321
a great sword is given unto you.

36:51.583 --> 36:55.004
Surely now, she pulled our peckers
when they needed pulling...

36:56.972 --> 37:01.302
Let the twins out to play when
they needed some company...

37:01.468 --> 37:02.762
Bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh, bluh.

37:06.807 --> 37:09.269
She petted your head,

37:09.435 --> 37:12.147
made you change your drawers.

37:14.355 --> 37:16.897
She was the one to say,

37:17.022 --> 37:22.532
"it's all right, Mickey,
it's all right."

37:30.122 --> 37:31.518
To Nell, boys!

37:31.643 --> 37:33.220
To Nell!

37:33.345 --> 37:34.752
And to Mr. Bohannon!

37:37.129 --> 37:38.882
He may be a son of a bitch,

37:39.048 --> 37:40.997
but he's our son of a bitch!

37:42.756 --> 37:48.933
Mr. Ferguson, it'd be best if
you drink elsewhere tonight.

37:50.566 --> 37:52.437
I'm drinking here tonight.

37:52.701 --> 37:59.485
Well, you were seen hiding around
a boxcar during the robbery.

38:04.844 --> 38:06.826
I was in the thick of it.

38:06.992 --> 38:11.456
Yeah, from which Mr. Bohannon
saved your black bottom.

38:46.290 --> 38:48.032
Johnny Reb come flying right at me

38:48.157 --> 38:52.770
like a bat out of hell, huh?
Eyes wild, horse snortin'...

38:52.895 --> 38:58.579
Ha ha! It's him or me...

38:58.704 --> 39:00.613
That's right.
And I lay him low!

39:00.738 --> 39:03.633
Ha ha! Lay him low.
That's right.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.593
Hold up, y'all. Hold up.

39:05.759 --> 39:08.352
You in the wrong place, ain't ya, son?

39:08.477 --> 39:10.682
The white folk bar over yonder.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.993
Come to drink with y'all.

39:14.118 --> 39:17.021
Hmm?

39:19.719 --> 39:21.887
All right.

39:25.395 --> 39:27.894
See what you got here.

39:32.502 --> 39:34.539
Hmm. Tennessee.

39:35.105 --> 39:36.807
That there the good stuff.

39:37.207 --> 39:39.321
Not that rot gut y'all drink.

39:39.446 --> 39:45.315
Hmm. Well, y'all, go on
and break that open. Hmm?

39:46.452 --> 39:49.222
Enjoy yourself.

39:49.845 --> 39:54.017
Guess me and you
down to the rot gut. Hmm.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.191
Good stuff.

40:31.787 --> 40:34.140
Shit'll make you blind.

40:34.306 --> 40:36.202
Mm-hmm.

40:36.327 --> 40:38.644
Make you see the good lord first though.

40:58.719 --> 41:03.459
You ever wonder what'll happen
to y'all if old man Durant die?

41:05.797 --> 41:10.635
Reckon we be on the first
train smokin' back to Georgia.

41:12.901 --> 41:14.764
How about you?

41:16.469 --> 41:18.351
What about me?

41:18.517 --> 41:21.581
How long you think you
gonna last in this town...

41:21.706 --> 41:23.439
Without him to protect you?

41:23.605 --> 41:25.900
Hmm?

41:26.066 --> 41:29.237
Just be another nigger
in the white man world.

41:34.916 --> 41:36.661
Mm-hmm.

41:47.795 --> 41:50.258
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.019
Is he dead?

42:02.185 --> 42:04.684
No.

42:12.070 --> 42:14.298
No. I already buried Hawkins.

42:14.573 --> 42:17.743
It says "all those
aiding and abetting."

42:27.753 --> 42:32.341
But doc... doc just held the horses.

42:34.307 --> 42:36.804
I'm sorry, Cullen.
