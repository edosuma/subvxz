WEBVTT

00:01.926 --> 00:03.597
Oh, man, not another election.

00:03.697 --> 00:05.432
Why do we have
to choose our leaders?

00:05.466 --> 00:07.400
Isn't that what we have
the Supreme Court for?

00:07.435 --> 00:09.302
(humming)

00:09.336 --> 00:11.304
If you're gonna vote,

00:11.338 --> 00:12.972
we'll need
some photo I.D.

00:13.007 --> 00:14.507
But I lived here all my life.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.810
Stopping all Americans
from voting is

00:16.844 --> 00:18.912
for the protection
of all Americans.

00:18.946 --> 00:22.215
But I'm a 40-year-old white guy
who didn't go to college

00:22.249 --> 00:24.951
and gets all his news from
monitors at gas stations.

00:24.985 --> 00:26.853
In you go.

00:28.339 --> 00:29.973
Barack Obama?

00:30.007 --> 00:31.241
I don't know.

00:31.275 --> 00:33.576
I already got one wife
telling me to eat healthy.

00:33.611 --> 00:35.078
Plus he promised me
death panels,

00:35.112 --> 00:36.412
and Grandpa's still alive.

00:36.447 --> 00:37.914
Mitt Romney?

00:37.948 --> 00:40.150
I hear he wears
magic underpants.

00:40.184 --> 00:42.886
I expect the leader of the
free world to go commando.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.288
Plus his horse totally choked
at the Olympics.

00:45.322 --> 00:48.391
On the other hand,
he <i>did</i> invent Obamacare.

00:48.425 --> 00:52.089
COMPUTER VOICE: Thank you for voting
for Mitt Romney.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.697
You may now see
his tax returns.

00:54.731 --> 00:58.350
Wow. Medical deduction
for personality implant?

00:58.368 --> 01:00.369
He's got six wives
all named Ann.

01:00.403 --> 01:03.088
The government paid <i>him</i> taxes
for five years!

01:03.123 --> 01:04.657
I've got to tell the press!

01:04.691 --> 01:06.292
(gasping)

01:06.326 --> 01:10.429
COMPUTER VOICE:
You are now being outsourced.

01:10.463 --> 01:13.182
Oh, I hate being sucked
into tubes!

01:15.252 --> 01:16.318
(grunts)

01:16.353 --> 01:18.587
Well, at least I got
a steady job.

01:18.622 --> 01:19.822
D'oh!

01:19.856 --> 01:20.823
<i>Oh!</i>

01:20.857 --> 01:23.325
(humming)

01:25.395 --> 01:27.162
(bubbling)

01:27.197 --> 01:30.232
Hummingbirds, hum and get it!

01:30.267 --> 01:31.767

01:35.872 --> 01:37.006

01:37.040 --> 01:38.073
(yowls)
(chirps)

01:43.730 --> 01:45.864
Homie, the faucet is dripping.

01:45.899 --> 01:47.533
I'll get right on it.

01:50.203 --> 01:52.705
Homer, when are you going
to fix this faucet?

01:52.739 --> 01:54.306
I'm on it!

01:55.875 --> 01:58.677
Are you going
to fix the faucet or not?

01:58.712 --> 02:02.748
For the third time
this year, yes!

02:02.782 --> 02:03.766
Hmpf!

"I'll get to it, Marge.
I'll get to it..."

02:35.932 --> 02:37.333
When we first got married,

02:37.367 --> 02:39.535
he'd only take six
months to do things.

02:39.569 --> 02:42.821
Mom, how come you didn't do
my homework last night?

02:42.856 --> 02:45.424
(all gasp)

02:45.458 --> 02:46.725
(all scream)

02:48.044 --> 02:49.278
Oh, no!

02:49.312 --> 02:52.815
Lisa's face, it's the same!
(chuckles)

02:52.849 --> 02:54.316
Everyone, relax.

02:54.351 --> 02:57.252
I think I've got an emergency
sinkhole kit in here somewhere.

02:57.287 --> 02:58.821
(grunts)

02:58.855 --> 02:59.838
(grunts)

02:59.873 --> 03:00.873
Ooh!

03:02.158 --> 03:04.142
(air his

03:04.160 --> 03:07.145
Oh, man, I got to climb stairs?
Forget it.

03:07.163 --> 03:09.415
No one stays in the sinkhole!

03:09.449 --> 03:11.917
Lousy surface dwellers.

03:14.387 --> 03:17.489
So, what seems
to be the problem?

03:17.524 --> 03:20.292
Springfielders are getting
that sinking feeling...

03:20.327 --> 03:21.677
(chuckles)

03:21.711 --> 03:24.880
...as the dangerous sinkhole
continues to expand.

03:24.914 --> 03:27.516
While this sinkhole is larger
than the Sarlacc pit

03:27.550 --> 03:29.618
which swallowed Boba Fett,

03:29.652 --> 03:31.920
it is smaller than the Geonosis
battlerena

03:31.955 --> 03:34.656
where Jango Fett was beheaded
by Mace Windu.

03:34.691 --> 03:37.192
Weren't those two places
about the same size?

03:37.227 --> 03:39.511
I didn't know
this was an ambush!

03:39.546 --> 03:42.147
Eh, you know, in this town,
you learn to adjust to things:

03:42.182 --> 03:45.467
runaway monorails,
NASCAR star Jeff Gordon.

03:45.502 --> 03:46.468
Hey, Moe.

03:46.503 --> 03:49.088
Hey.
Bet we never see him again.

03:49.122 --> 03:51.457
I'm gonna call
it a day, Moe.

03:51.491 --> 03:52.491
(humming)

03:52.525 --> 03:54.426
(gasping)

03:55.028 --> 03:56.395
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:56.429 --> 03:58.130
That plank's
only for coming in!

03:58.164 --> 04:00.232
(gasping, screams)

04:00.266 --> 04:01.834
Try to land on
the other traitors.

04:01.868 --> 04:03.001
(men grunt)

04:03.036 --> 04:06.121
People of Springfield,
please be cool like Lou.

04:06.156 --> 04:07.322
Yo.

04:07.357 --> 04:09.725
We will eliminate one eyesore
with another

04:09.759 --> 04:13.529
by bulldozing our tire fire
right into the sinkhole.

04:14.664 --> 04:16.832
But my car's down there!

04:19.069 --> 04:20.435
For the first time,

04:20.470 --> 04:22.771
my administration has solved
a problem.

04:22.806 --> 04:26.341
The hole has been filled by the
thing it fears most: stuff!

04:26.376 --> 04:27.392
(gasps)

04:30.296 --> 04:31.980
(crowd cheering,
camera shutters clicking)

04:32.015 --> 04:33.248
(groans)

04:33.283 --> 04:34.283
(bell rings)

04:34.317 --> 04:35.517
(kids laughing)

04:35.552 --> 04:37.202
So, just when
my dad finishes

04:37.237 --> 04:40.038
his online degree
in Sinkhole Engineering,

04:40.073 --> 04:41.573
they go and fill it in!

04:41.608 --> 04:42.674
Are the credits
transferable?

04:42.709 --> 04:44.910
No.
That guy has  a bone to pick

04:44.944 --> 04:46.095
with the Board
of Regents.

04:46.129 --> 04:48.046
Hey, Lisa's not
getting on the bus.

04:50.066 --> 04:51.133
Where's she going?

04:51.167 --> 04:53.368
I don't know.
Dork farm? Who cares?

04:53.403 --> 04:56.338
She never doesn't do
what she's supposed to!

04:56.372 --> 04:57.523
This is major!

04:57.557 --> 05:00.058
Fine.
We'll follow her.

05:01.478 --> 05:05.614
Well, if they're not taking
the bus, neither am I.

05:07.617 --> 05:09.618
I'm going to a accident!

05:10.987 --> 05:13.155
Lisa's taking a cab?

05:13.189 --> 05:14.723
I'm worried.

05:14.757 --> 05:16.742
Does she even know
how much to tip?

05:17.677 --> 05:18.760
(tires squeal)

05:19.963 --> 05:21.330
What's it say?

05:21.364 --> 05:25.033
"The five boxing wizards
jump quickly." Whoa.

05:25.068 --> 05:29.054
My sister's finally become...
mildly interesting.

05:29.088 --> 05:31.940
Sounds like a case
for the "Detecti-pals."

05:31.975 --> 05:33.208
Taxi!

05:33.243 --> 05:34.460
(horn blares)

05:34.494 --> 05:37.079
Ah, they never stop
for blue-heads.

05:37.964 --> 05:39.248
Hello, ma'am.

05:39.282 --> 05:41.800
Are you and your husband here
to look for a new car?

05:41.835 --> 05:43.735
No, I'm here
to buy one myself.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.571
Uh-huh.

05:45.605 --> 05:49.441
Well, I think the Tissan
Sensibla is the car for you.

05:49.476 --> 05:50.809
It's got all
the features

05:50.844 --> 05:52.094
that a modern
woman wants,

05:52.128 --> 05:54.913
including all manner
of makeup mirrors.

05:57.317 --> 05:59.284
This car looks
a little small.

05:59.319 --> 06:00.385
Is the engine powerful?

06:00.420 --> 06:03.288
Wow, somebody
knows her cars.

06:03.323 --> 06:08.093
This baby comes with
an RX-12 2-cylinder.

06:08.127 --> 06:10.829
Well, that's odd, because
the consumer Web site says

06:10.864 --> 06:12.598
the RX-12 2-cylinder has

06:12.632 --> 06:14.967
a dealer's invoice
of $14,700.

06:15.001 --> 06:17.035
(chuckles)
You know what I'm gonna do?

06:17.070 --> 06:18.570
I'm gonna talk
to my manager.

06:18.605 --> 06:20.806
This says you <i>are</i> the manager.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.742
Those Web sites are taking food
out of my children's mouths.

06:23.776 --> 06:26.445
It says on your Facebook page
you have no kids.

06:26.479 --> 06:27.813
I have two Yorkies,

06:27.847 --> 06:30.516
and I'll be talking
about you to them tonight!

06:31.985 --> 06:33.669
I got to hand it
to you, Marge.

06:33.703 --> 06:36.288
You got the exact amount
of car for our family.

06:36.322 --> 06:39.741
Room for two adults, three kids
and zero grandpas.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.026
Mm-hmm.

06:41.044 --> 06:43.545
Uh-oh!
Do you hear that rattle?

06:43.580 --> 06:44.963
I don't hear anything.

06:44.998 --> 06:45.948
Me, neither.

06:45.982 --> 06:48.199
(sniffs)
And what's that smell?

06:48.218 --> 06:50.335
I think it's "new car smell."

06:50.370 --> 06:51.503
Well, I don't like it.

06:51.538 --> 06:52.337
(tires screech)

06:52.372 --> 06:53.355
(humming)

06:58.228 --> 06:59.861
(humming continues)

07:01.548 --> 07:03.782
(kids cough and groan)

07:03.816 --> 07:06.351
I still smell it!

07:06.386 --> 07:09.087
(starter chugging)

07:09.122 --> 07:10.923
Darn car won't start.

07:10.957 --> 07:14.693
Let Automobile Von Bismarck
give it a try.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.128
(engine starts)

07:16.162 --> 07:17.329
Well...

07:17.363 --> 07:19.398
Hmm. Well, it wouldn't
start for me.

07:19.432 --> 07:21.400
(hushed):
I think this car's a lemon!

07:21.434 --> 07:23.936
(groans)

07:23.970 --> 07:25.771
Worst car ever!
I can't believe it!

07:25.805 --> 07:28.006
Hmm...

07:28.041 --> 07:29.074
(groans)

07:29.108 --> 07:31.043
MARGE:
<i>The wipers wipe backwards,</i>

07:31.077 --> 07:33.111
and the defroster lines on

07:33.146 --> 07:34.780
the back window
are too close together!

07:34.814 --> 07:36.615
Excuse me!

07:39.519 --> 07:40.919
Sir, the car is fine.

07:40.954 --> 07:42.721
Can I be straight with you?
Mm-hmm.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.990
As a mechanic,
I'm not totally qualified

07:45.024 --> 07:46.825
to judge mental health...

07:46.859 --> 07:49.695
So, you're not
totally unqualified.

07:49.729 --> 07:51.893
I think the problem
is in your wife's head.

07:51.918 --> 07:52.464
Mm-hmm.

07:52.465 --> 07:55.500
There's a psychological reason
why she hates this car.

07:55.535 --> 07:57.703
Oh, a reason?
What could it be?

07:57.737 --> 08:00.839
I'm sorry, but there's
no diagnostic computer

08:00.873 --> 08:02.574
for the female mind.

08:02.609 --> 08:06.211
Wow, an auto mechanic
who tells the truth.

08:06.245 --> 08:08.146
Mmm!

08:08.181 --> 08:10.899
If you want me to examine
your wife overnight,

08:10.933 --> 08:12.401
I can arrange a loaner.

08:12.435 --> 08:14.136
She's an '83 Yugo.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.705
(Yugoslavian accent): I don't do laundry
or kiss boo-boos!

08:16.739 --> 08:19.374
Uh, no, thanks.

08:20.393 --> 08:21.593
Marge.
Mm-hmm?

08:21.627 --> 08:23.461
Do you think maybe
there's another reason

08:23.479 --> 08:24.830
you don't like this car?

08:24.864 --> 08:26.598
Um, a...

08:26.633 --> 08:28.266
"feelings" reason?

08:28.301 --> 08:29.968
What are you talking about?

08:30.003 --> 08:33.371
Well, maybe you and the car
got off on the wrong foot.

08:33.405 --> 08:35.506
When do you think
things first went wrong?

08:35.541 --> 08:37.576
All right!
I remember we all got in.

08:37.610 --> 08:40.746
And by the way, that backseat
is pretty tight for the kids.

08:40.780 --> 08:44.483
I mean, I don't know what we'd
do if we had another baby.

08:44.517 --> 08:45.951
(gasps)

08:45.985 --> 08:50.122
With this car, we're basically
saying no more babies.

08:50.156 --> 08:51.256
No, no, Marge.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.792
I want you to explore
your <i>feelings.</i>

08:53.826 --> 08:57.562
Homer, the reason
I hate this car is...

08:57.597 --> 08:59.665
I think I want another baby.

08:59.699 --> 09:01.867
An "on purpose" baby?!

09:01.901 --> 09:03.669
I do!

09:05.805 --> 09:09.107
<i>Oh, I really wish</i>
<i>I had fixed that faucet.</i>

09:10.234 --> 09:12.250
Homie, I want another baby.

09:12.350 --> 09:13.917
What about, you know, "Stinky"?

09:13.952 --> 09:15.452
Maggie's not a baby!

09:15.487 --> 09:17.254
Her soft spot's
been skulled over

09:17.288 --> 09:19.156
for the last three months!

09:19.190 --> 09:24.294
Being a mom is who I am,
and I'm not done being who I am.

09:24.329 --> 09:25.896
<i>Okay, Homer, don't speak.</i>

09:25.930 --> 09:28.098
<i>If you must make a sound,</i>
<i>whistle.</i>

09:28.133 --> 09:30.901
<i>When your wife looks at you</i>
<i>full of hope,</i>

09:30.935 --> 09:33.303
<i>with an idea that would</i>
<i>destroy life as we know it...</i>

09:33.338 --> 09:37.174
<i>just smile, nod</i>
<i>and stall, stall, stall</i>

09:37.208 --> 09:39.076
<i>until she changes her mind.</i>

09:39.110 --> 09:40.477
Whatever you want,
sweetie.

09:40.512 --> 09:41.678
Well, take a shower,

09:41.713 --> 09:43.847
'cause we're gonna
try it tonight!

09:43.882 --> 09:47.184
<i>All right!</i>
<i>"Try it" means sex.</i>

09:47.218 --> 09:48.285
Whoo-hoo!

09:48.319 --> 09:50.487
Homer, why do you take
a three-second pause

09:50.522 --> 09:52.389
before you answer
what I say?

09:54.325 --> 09:56.927
Just appreciating...

09:56.961 --> 09:59.963
how lucky...

09:59.998 --> 10:02.299
I am to be...

10:02.333 --> 10:04.234
with...

10:04.269 --> 10:05.469
you.

10:05.503 --> 10:07.604
What a wonderful thought.

10:11.109 --> 10:12.910
(Homer, Marge laughing)

10:16.915 --> 10:20.017
Boxing wizards.
Boxing wizards.

10:21.519 --> 10:23.120
What's she up to?

10:24.823 --> 10:26.690
Let's settle this
like adults.

10:26.724 --> 10:28.692
Wands down!

10:31.930 --> 10:35.365
Maybe I should go
on antipsychotic meds.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.035
Bart! What are you
doing in my room?!

10:38.069 --> 10:39.269
Lowering your blinds.

10:39.304 --> 10:40.838
I'd hate for your carpet
to fade.

10:44.826 --> 10:47.161
What are you doing Tuesdays
and Thursdays after school?

10:47.195 --> 10:49.730
What do <i>you</i> do Tuesdays
and Thursdays after school?

10:49.764 --> 10:51.365
Write stupid stuff
on the chalkboard.

10:51.399 --> 10:53.417
And if you have any ideas,
I'm really running out.

10:53.451 --> 10:55.419
Today's was "mousetraps are
not slippers" or something.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.254
Now, what are you up to?

10:57.288 --> 10:58.939
A gentleman doesn't ask,

10:58.973 --> 11:00.407
and a lady doesn't tell.

11:00.441 --> 11:01.708
Can I use that
on the chalkboard?

11:01.743 --> 11:03.076
I guess.

11:03.111 --> 11:05.379
Gentleman doesn't ask,
lady doesn't tell.

11:05.413 --> 11:07.631
Now all I need is one for
Martin Luther King Day.

11:07.665 --> 11:09.633
My husband and
I have been...

11:09.667 --> 11:12.386
snuggling six ways
from Sunday...

11:12.420 --> 11:13.754
And let me tell you,

11:13.788 --> 11:16.523
a towel rack will not
support your weight.

11:16.558 --> 11:18.158
But we aren't making a baby.

11:18.193 --> 11:20.594
I thought we should check
to make sure Homer has...

11:20.628 --> 11:24.031
you know, working
stuntmen in his cannon.

11:24.065 --> 11:25.666
You were wise to check, Marge.

11:25.700 --> 11:26.900
What do you mean?

11:26.935 --> 11:28.702
(chuckles)

11:28.736 --> 11:29.937
Take a look at this.

11:31.105 --> 11:32.506
HOMER:
Ooh...

11:32.540 --> 11:35.075
X's for eyes.

11:35.109 --> 11:36.777
I guess...
that's that, then.

11:36.811 --> 11:39.646
Honey, I am so sorry.

11:39.681 --> 11:41.715
I guess we'll just
have to learn to love

11:41.749 --> 11:43.483

are boxing wizards.

If we're gonna find out
what Lisa's up to,

11:51.910 --> 11:53.810
I'll need the help
of all her old boyfriends.

13:02.397 --> 13:04.431
Homer can't make a baby

13:04.465 --> 13:06.867

How long have you felt this way?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.876
Uh, well, looking back,

16:58.910 --> 17:02.179

MARGE:

18:19.339 --> 18:22.508
<i>He's thinking that he</i>
<i>really wants a baby now.</i>

18:22.542 --> 18:25.210
<i>So this should be</i>
<i>the time, ironically,</i>

18:25.245 --> 18:28.080
<i>that I'll change my mind</i>
<i>and not want one.</i>

18:28.114 --> 18:30.416
<i>Well, no way!</i>
<i>I want one more than ever!</i>

18:30.450 --> 18:31.984

18:33.420 --> 18:34.820
Uh-oh. I...

18:34.854 --> 18:37.656

video the last time I was here.

18:37.691 --> 18:40.059
Um, I'd like
to get back a donation

18:40.093 --> 18:43.862

18:49.686 --> 18:50.953
Homer, this is the point

18:50.987 --> 18:53.188
where I really have to
know what you want.

18:53.223 --> 18:55.057
I'll tell you
what I want, Marge.

18:55.091 --> 18:56.809
I want to make another Simpson.

18:56.843 --> 18:58.577
The table with four legs

18:58.611 --> 19:00.763
is sturdier than
the table with three.

19:00.797 --> 19:04.349
Cubes are made of cheese,
but pyramids are schemes.

19:04.367 --> 19:06.051
And anything that's half you

19:06.086 --> 19:09.054
is guaranteed 50% perfect.

19:09.089 --> 19:10.589
Oh...

19:10.623 --> 19:13.225
Nice speech,
but the last of your sample

19:13.259 --> 19:15.194
was just selected
by another couple.

19:15.228 --> 19:16.795
Are you sure there isn't more?

19:16.830 --> 19:17.896
I mean, there's always

19:17.931 --> 19:19.365
a little ketchup
left in the bottle.

19:19.399 --> 19:20.899
I'm afraid not.

19:20.934 --> 19:22.801
But the couple is waiting
in the room there.

19:22.836 --> 19:25.704
Maybe you can talk them
into something else.

19:25.739 --> 19:27.706
(Homer clears throat)

19:27.741 --> 19:29.274
Aah!
Oh!

19:29.309 --> 19:31.443
I'd like to buy back my sample.

19:31.478 --> 19:33.145

19:33.179 --> 19:35.080
our sample came from you?

19:35.115 --> 19:36.548
Here, it's yours.
We don't need it.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.267
Well, I expected
a little argument.

19:38.301 --> 19:40.269
No, no, no, look in the mirror--
that's your argument.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.687
Geez.

19:41.721 --> 19:44.056
I mean, I'm no Luis Guzman,
but I'm all right.

19:47.427 --> 19:49.128
(Marge gasps)

19:49.162 --> 19:50.429
Homer?

19:50.463 --> 19:52.798
How many samples did you sell?

19:52.832 --> 19:54.133
Uh...

19:54.167 --> 19:56.068
remember that Corvette I had?

19:56.102 --> 19:58.504
I thought they only paid
$50 a trip.

19:58.538 --> 19:59.705
Exactly.

19:59.739 --> 20:00.906
Well, we're all set.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.609
Let's make a
Thad Supersperm Jr.

20:03.643 --> 20:05.878
With a name like that,
he could be president.

20:05.912 --> 20:07.613
Homie, maybe we should wait.

20:07.647 --> 20:08.814
Wha...?

20:08.848 --> 20:11.350
Maybe there's enough Homer
in the world for now.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.618
Oh.

20:12.652 --> 20:14.586
But I was really
looking forward to...

20:15.955 --> 20:18.407
Oh... oh, boy. Uh...

20:18.441 --> 20:19.908
You're right, Marge.

20:19.942 --> 20:23.378
I don't want to bring more kids
into a world full of my kids.

20:23.413 --> 20:24.746
Yah!

20:27.450 --> 20:29.985
Two adults, please.

20:30.019 --> 20:32.437
Enjoy the film, you two.

20:35.441 --> 20:36.842
(laughing)

20:36.876 --> 20:40.378
Another thing that would
be harder with four kids.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.614
You know, I always send
the theater manager

20:42.648 --> 20:44.082
a check the next day.

20:44.117 --> 20:45.851
