more important, and act
as a beacon to others.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.440
I couldn't risk telling anyone.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.680

who was responsible...

28:57.800 --> 29:00.360
I hope you know the consequences
of what you are saying.

29:00.480 --> 29:04.160

to me earlier about this.
-I understand.

-Have you got the necessary
equipment to get to the capital?
-We're working on it.

office leader for a reason.

-We shouldn't talk about that.
Not now.

-Yates knows?
-She understands our situation.

-Obviously she's not
happy we lied to her.
-You can't go back there.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.400
-It's London, Charlie. London.
-We have to.

handled the last attack,
it'll happen again.

it's important he comes with me.

-No. I already have radiation

Not to London.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.720
The loss...

43:35.840 --> 43:37.640
Of a city.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.920
These people, that's the
phrase we used to use.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.640
"What's wrong with
these people?"

43:59.760 --> 44:03.960
There was one man.
He didn't need to be broken.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.560
He just spoke.

44:05.680 --> 44:08.360
Four, five hours. Maybe more.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.160
Please...

44:10.280 --> 44:12.800
How corrupt our
society is, broken,

44:12.920 --> 44:16.960
how people like me just
accept it, and become part
of the mechanism...

44:18.320 --> 44:21.720
OK, Union Square should
be straight down here.

44:21.840 --> 44:26.960
PRIME MINISTER: We do this now
not just for ourselves, but to
honour those who have gone.

44:27.080 --> 44:31.600
-Please, please help me...
-I am trying to help you.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.760
I'm trying to help
you understand what it was like.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.200
To have someone
explain so clearly

44:37.320 --> 44:40.440
all these little doubts that
had been eating away at you.

44:40.560 --> 44:42.400
JEZ: This way, come on, hurry!

44:43.400 --> 44:45.840
I believed in what he said.

44:46.880 --> 44:48.600
They'll find you...

44:56.160 --> 44:59.160
Maybe I played my part
in training you all too well.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.360
Under different circumstances,

45:02.480 --> 45:05.360
I'd almost be proud.

45:05.480 --> 45:07.680
I'm sorry, Rachel.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.840
Come on.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.640
Kylie, update.

45:14.760 --> 45:18.080
-It's a maze down here,
it could be anywhere.
-Just keep looking.

45:18.200 --> 45:21.160
If Yates is in there,
we need her alive.

45:21.280 --> 45:23.080
She's our only link
to that bomb.

45:24.520 --> 45:26.680
Put it down.

45:26.800 --> 45:30.960
-You know I can't
do that, Charlie.
-Where's the second bomb?

45:31.080 --> 45:34.400
-Last warning!
-This isn't the end, Charlie,
this is only the beginning.

45:34.520 --> 45:35.560
No!

45:35.680 --> 45:37.160
[GUNSHOT]

45:41.840 --> 45:45.000
Rachel, Rachel...
It's no use, Charlie.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.560
Rachel, it's Rob,
can you hear me?

45:46.680 --> 45:48.120
Oh, my God!

45:48.240 --> 45:50.840
It's Rob. Rachel,
can you hear me?

45:50.960 --> 45:52.720
Rachel, nod if you can hear me.

45:52.840 --> 45:55.720
I've got a weak pulse,
keep talking to her, Charlie.

45:57.640 --> 46:00.160
Jesus, this is bad.

46:00.280 --> 46:03.880
It's Charlie, Rachel. It's going
to be OK. I promise you...

46:04.000 --> 46:05.920
Yeah. Hello, I need
an ambulance.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.760
-Jez, talk to me. The bomb?
-Still searching, Charlie.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.080
We think it could be right under
the Square. We're really close.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.080
Did you find her?
Did you find Rachel?

46:14.200 --> 46:18.040
-Yeah, we found her, she's safe.
-Charlie...

46:19.400 --> 46:22.160
We remain together.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.800
We remain a country.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.480
We remain strong...

46:32.040 --> 46:34.200
JEZ: Charlie! We found it.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.120
Bomb squad's going in now.

46:38.560 --> 46:42.480
We do this
not just for ourselves,

46:42.600 --> 46:46.000
but to honour those
who have gone.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.480
OK, we're losing her pulse,
we're gonna start CPR.

46:48.600 --> 46:52.520
Charlie, put your hand on the
wound and press hard for me.

46:54.280 --> 46:57.080
This day, we remember them.

47:00.800 --> 47:02.840
Don't you dare leave us!

47:05.440 --> 47:07.400
Press as hard as
you can, Charlie.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.600
Come on, Rachel,
fucking come on!

47:35.800 --> 47:38.640
We will not forget.
