WEBVTT

00:04.453 --> 00:06.516
We don't have much time,
they're gonna follow us.

00:06.616 --> 00:09.119
- How do we stop them?
- We have to think of something.

00:09.219 --> 00:11.222
We can't just let them take Wyatt.

00:12.464 --> 00:14.166
Incoming!

00:14.266 --> 00:16.268
It's pointless to run.

00:16.789 --> 00:18.792
You can't have him.

00:20.394 --> 00:23.298
You're only delaying
the inevitable, I'm afraid.

00:23.398 --> 00:27.523
Now, if you don't mind,
we have a lot of cleaning to do.

00:32.329 --> 00:34.332
No!

00:36.094 --> 00:38.397
Leo!

00:38.498 --> 00:39.679
Wyatt!

00:39.779 --> 00:43.504
An Elder, good.
Perhaps you can explain it to her.

00:43.865 --> 00:45.867
Explain? Explain what?

00:47.109 --> 00:49.111
Well, do something.
Don't just stand there.

00:50.673 --> 00:52.676
I can't.

00:53.237 --> 00:55.720
- Nobody can.
- What the hell are you talking about?

00:57.723 --> 00:59.425
Please, he's just a baby.

00:59.525 --> 01:01.828
It won't happen again.
I won't let it happen again.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.672
Sorry, we can't take that risk.

01:04.772 --> 01:05.873
Don't worry.

01:05.973 --> 01:08.216
You won't remember
any of this anyway.

01:27.802 --> 01:29.805
What are you doing here?

01:30.606 --> 01:32.608
I don't know.

01:33.369 --> 01:35.372
Better go.

01:36.814 --> 01:38.957
What were we talking about?

01:39.057 --> 01:42.161
- I don't know.
- I'm beat. I'm gonna go up to bed.

01:42.261 --> 01:45.225
Yeah, I'm tired too.

01:46.787 --> 01:48.169
You all right?

01:48.269 --> 01:51.393
Yeah, I just feel like
I'm forgetting something.

01:51.713 --> 01:52.975
Like what?

01:53.075 --> 01:54.577
I don't know.

01:54.677 --> 01:57.160
Must not be very important.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.459
<i>Say goodbye to yesterday's rain and</i>
<i>"Good morning, sunshine."</i>

03:12.779 --> 03:15.082
<i>It is a beautiful Wednesday</i>
<i>in San Francisco,</i>

03:15.182 --> 03:18.206
<i>and if you're like me, you want</i>
<i>to forget all about yesterday.</i>

03:18.306 --> 03:20.249
<i>I know I do. Thank you very much.</i>

03:20.349 --> 03:23.013
Any infomercials
for stain remover on there?

03:23.113 --> 03:25.175
You have a stain
that needs removal?

03:25.276 --> 03:28.059
Yes, I spilled coffee
on my blouse yesterday,

03:28.159 --> 03:31.684
so that dork walking around the office
with a big old stain on her shirt,

03:32.004 --> 03:34.668
- that'd be me.
- Have you tried baking soda?

03:34.768 --> 03:38.373
No, it's dry-clean only,
so it's gonna eat up a half a day's pay.

03:38.693 --> 03:43.459
The pay is lousy, your boss is
a sexist pig, why don't you just quit?

03:43.820 --> 03:47.384
The job sucks
and it's just a temp job anyway.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.989
Because, if I want a life
outside of magic,

03:51.310 --> 03:53.372
I can't just quit
every time a job starts sucking.

03:53.472 --> 03:55.615
Besides, I stuck around
with the dog-walking job,

03:55.715 --> 03:57.337
and hey, I wound up
helping somebody.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.739
Yeah, okay, but that was once.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.263
What are the odds of something
like that happening again?

04:01.363 --> 04:04.667
I don't know. But sometimes they say
you gotta ride a lot of different horses

04:04.767 --> 04:07.351
on the merry-go-round
before you find what you're looking for.

04:07.451 --> 04:09.033
Carousel.

04:09.133 --> 04:10.234
Sorry?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.437
Well, a merry-go-round
has lots of animals,

04:12.537 --> 04:14.520
a carousel only has horses.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.623
Okay, why do you
even know that, weirdo?

04:17.983 --> 04:19.987
I have no idea.

04:20.908 --> 04:22.911
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

04:23.672 --> 04:25.675
- Now it's gone.
- Now what's gone?

04:26.476 --> 04:30.561
I know this may sound crazy,
but I think I just heard a baby.

04:30.921 --> 04:32.503
Yeah, you're crazy.

04:32.604 --> 04:34.065
Piper!

04:34.166 --> 04:36.068
Oh, my God, I heard something.

04:36.168 --> 04:38.391
Oh, be quiet. Coming.

04:38.491 --> 04:41.756
How long do you think she's gonna
spend down there, the rest of her life?

04:41.856 --> 04:43.438
Yeah, long enough to be sure

04:43.538 --> 04:46.642
she doesn't shove her tongue down
the throat of the next delivery guy.

04:46.742 --> 04:48.484
I heard that.

04:48.584 --> 04:50.928
For your information, we're lucky
that guy didn't sue me

04:51.028 --> 04:52.129
for sexual harassment.

04:52.229 --> 04:54.432
Well, you were
channelling his emotions.

04:55.073 --> 04:56.295
That's not the point.

04:56.395 --> 04:58.898
The point is, I have to figure out
how to work my new power,

04:58.998 --> 05:02.443
or I'm gonna have to lock myself down
in this basement for the rest of my life.

05:04.525 --> 05:06.528
Stay behind the yellow line.

05:08.490 --> 05:10.713
I might channel
what you both are feeling.

05:10.814 --> 05:13.016
Sure, would you like me
to toss you your breakfast?

05:14.659 --> 05:16.361
What happened to your head?

05:16.461 --> 05:18.203
This? I don't know.

05:18.303 --> 05:21.187
I've been so scattered lately,
I must have bumped it or something.

05:21.507 --> 05:25.272
Now, are either one of you
feeling any strong emotions?

05:25.633 --> 05:27.736
Anger? Sadness?

05:27.836 --> 05:29.538
Annoyance?

05:29.638 --> 05:32.161
- You may proceed.
- Thanks.

05:33.603 --> 05:35.386
Wait a minute.

05:35.486 --> 05:37.488
One of you is feeling insecure.

05:39.972 --> 05:44.177
What? I'm just feeling
a little off today, that's all.

05:44.538 --> 05:46.600
Stop looking at me like that.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.604
And you cut the crust off my toast,

05:49.704 --> 05:52.368
and cut my eggs into little bits,

05:52.468 --> 05:55.552
and look,
there's applesauce and milk.

05:57.114 --> 05:58.936
Piper, I'm not in second grade.

05:59.037 --> 06:02.221
I just thought maybe you'd like
some milk, for some strong bones.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.584
Okay, what is going on
with you, lady?

06:04.684 --> 06:08.008
Carousels, hearing babies
and now milk for strong bones.

06:08.329 --> 06:10.271
Wait, you were hearing babies?

06:10.371 --> 06:13.736
Forget it, I'm sure it's nothing.
Forget it.

06:16.579 --> 06:19.804
<i>- Hey, Elise, how'd you like the...?</i>
<i>- You're not getting off that easy.</i>

06:19.904 --> 06:21.246
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Just get in here!</i>

06:21.346 --> 06:25.471
No, I can't come in today
because I am very sick.

06:27.794 --> 06:30.858
<i>Yesterday you completely</i>
<i>turned the office upside down!</i>

06:30.958 --> 06:32.540
Wait, but I didn't come in yesterday.

06:32.640 --> 06:34.062
<i>- Yes, you did!</i>
<i>- Oh, I did?</i>

06:34.162 --> 06:36.586
<i>I don't care if that was</i>
<i>a Phoebe Halliwell look-alike,</i>

06:36.686 --> 06:38.708
<i>you get your butt in here now</i>
<i>or it's your job!</i>

06:38.809 --> 06:41.532
<i>- Do you understand? I mean it!</i>
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>

06:43.014 --> 06:44.516
What was that about?

06:44.616 --> 06:45.918
That was Elise.

06:46.018 --> 06:48.922
She wants me to come
into work ASAP, or it's my job.

06:49.022 --> 06:50.404
Your job? Why would she say that?

06:50.504 --> 06:53.748
I have no idea.
Something about yesterday.

06:54.749 --> 06:56.752
Must have bumped my head
pretty hard, huh?

06:57.233 --> 06:59.936
Well, looks like you're gonna
have to brave the big, bad world.

07:00.036 --> 07:03.220
- Want me to give you a ride?
- No, I'll drive.

07:03.321 --> 07:05.764
This way I can get in and out fast.

07:06.685 --> 07:10.190
Hey, don't forget your coats.
It might rain.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.493
Would you stop
mothering us, please?

07:18.781 --> 07:21.905
Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben.
Please hold.

07:22.225 --> 07:25.429
Ritz, Teukolsky and Ruben.
Please hold.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.652
Who are you holding for?

07:27.753 --> 07:30.837
You wouldn't happen to need
any help with anything, would you?

07:31.157 --> 07:33.160
Flo, what happened?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.023
I just got fired,
that's what happened.

07:36.123 --> 07:40.209
What? Oh, not you.
You call back, or something.

07:43.012 --> 07:45.436
I don't understand. Why?

07:45.536 --> 07:47.158
You ought to know.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.362
No, I don't, and I want to help,
believe me,

07:50.462 --> 07:53.426
but I can't help unless you tell me,
you know, why you were fired.

07:54.427 --> 07:56.330
So Mr. Stewick
gets me in his office and says,

07:56.430 --> 07:58.593
either I go out with him again,
or he fires me.

07:59.434 --> 08:01.176
I didn't take his offer.

08:01.276 --> 08:04.521
So he told me to pack up.
My word against his, you know?

08:04.841 --> 08:06.844
I would have gone in
with you if you asked.

08:07.364 --> 08:09.367
I did, I asked you yesterday.

08:09.687 --> 08:12.671
Obviously, I don't rank high enough
in importance for you to remember.

08:12.771 --> 08:15.395
No, no, seriously,
I would remember that.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.898
Excuse me, do you mind?

08:20.862 --> 08:22.804
Back to the phones, Francine.

08:22.905 --> 08:25.688
Paige. My name is Paige.

08:25.788 --> 08:29.193
Whatever. You're a temp.
Do you wanna help people?

08:29.513 --> 08:33.679
Sit your pretty ass back down,
answer the damn phone.

08:46.375 --> 08:48.578
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:50.340 --> 08:52.944
Leo, hey!

08:54.266 --> 08:55.968
I didn't know you were coming here.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.551
I can see that.
Are you drinking beer?

09:00.033 --> 09:01.335
I was gonna pay for that.

09:01.435 --> 09:03.337
Chris, what are you doing
sitting around here?

09:03.438 --> 09:06.321
Aren't you supposed to be
getting to know your new charge?

09:08.805 --> 09:11.108
Oh, hi, Leo.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.549
Okay, look, before you get mad,

09:12.650 --> 09:15.553
you're the one who wanted me
to have a charge in the first place.

09:15.654 --> 09:18.718
- Yeah, to protect her.
- Oh, he was using protection.

09:18.818 --> 09:20.560
Yeah, I don't think
that's what he meant.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.842
Are you out of your mind?

09:21.942 --> 09:24.745
Aside from this being out of line,
it's completely against the rules.

09:25.506 --> 09:27.329
Yeah, you're one to talk.

09:27.429 --> 09:29.432
Oh, I don't think that's his point.

09:31.755 --> 09:34.058
Why don't I just...

09:34.158 --> 09:36.521
...leave you two alone?

09:38.003 --> 09:40.506
Look, I was just having a little fun,
what's the big deal?

09:40.606 --> 09:42.749
It's not like I have anything
pressing to do anyway.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.852
You don't have anything pressing?

09:45.252 --> 09:48.016
Then why exactly did you come back
from the future in the first place?

09:51.020 --> 09:53.022
I don't know.

09:53.423 --> 09:55.426
- I forgot.
- You forgot.

09:58.790 --> 10:01.674
- Do you hear that?
- What?

10:02.395 --> 10:05.719
Never mind.
We'll talk about this later.

10:10.766 --> 10:12.768
Is he gone?

10:27.427 --> 10:30.371
I don't care what she says, Phoebe,
I always wanted to do what you did,

10:30.471 --> 10:32.093
and man, was it good
to see you do it!

10:32.194 --> 10:35.478
Oh, thanks for your support, Frank.

10:44.450 --> 10:47.814
- Hey, Elise, what is going on out...?
- Sit.

10:54.222 --> 10:57.206
I wanted to talk to you alone
before I involved any lawyers.

10:57.306 --> 10:59.309
Lawyers? What...?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.735
I'm not going to pretend that the only
reason you're still working here

11:03.835 --> 11:05.818
is that you're an asset
to the paper.

11:05.918 --> 11:07.960
But what the hell
came over you yesterday?

11:08.281 --> 11:09.462
Yesterday?

11:09.562 --> 11:12.687
Because there are three workers
out with injuries.

11:13.448 --> 11:17.373
Jackie's got a broken nose!
Not to mention...

11:17.893 --> 11:20.116
Yeah, that does look
like it hurts a lot.

11:20.216 --> 11:23.821
It's all I can do
to keep lawsuits from pouring in.

11:24.142 --> 11:26.525
If there were, perhaps,
a reasonable explanation

11:26.625 --> 11:28.047
for your behaviour yesterday...

11:28.147 --> 11:30.950
Elise, I'm sorry. But I honestly
have no idea what you're talking about.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.794
Phoebe!

11:41.845 --> 11:45.730
I'm feeling a lot worse. I gotta go.

11:48.453 --> 11:51.497
Okay, here we go.
All right, come on, sweetheart.

11:52.018 --> 11:54.021
Now, don't be fussy.

11:55.022 --> 11:56.644
You hungry?

11:56.744 --> 11:59.027
Don't be fussy.
Do you want a bottle?

12:01.631 --> 12:04.374
You know, if you bounce a little,
and make a shushing sound,

12:04.474 --> 12:07.078
it usually helps. Hi.

12:09.961 --> 12:12.605
Wow, that was amazing.
How did you calm him down so fast?

12:13.446 --> 12:16.290
Well, the shushing sound supposedly
reminds them of the womb.

12:16.610 --> 12:19.734
Amazing. You must be a terrific mom
to know all this stuff.

12:20.856 --> 12:23.038
No, actually, I don't have kids.

12:23.139 --> 12:25.482
Really? Guess I just assumed.

12:25.582 --> 12:27.524
Oh, well, I always wanted them.

12:27.624 --> 12:30.008
I babysat a lot, but...

12:30.108 --> 12:32.110
I should go.

12:34.073 --> 12:37.397
- My diapers?
- Oh, sorry.

12:38.238 --> 12:39.500
- Thank you.
- Got it?

12:39.600 --> 12:42.884
Yep. You okay, sweetheart?
Want some chips?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.768
Leo.

13:00.868 --> 13:03.932
Piper, what are you doing here?

13:04.032 --> 13:05.334
What am I doing here?

13:05.434 --> 13:07.176
No, that's not what I meant.

13:07.276 --> 13:09.279
It's just...

13:10.120 --> 13:12.103
- I shouldn't be here.
- No, you shouldn't.

13:12.203 --> 13:14.666
I mean, I asked you to stay away
for a good reason.

13:14.766 --> 13:16.669
So that I could learn
to live without you.

13:16.769 --> 13:17.870
I know.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.393
And if you just keep orbing in
whenever you feel like it,

13:20.494 --> 13:22.356
that's not really gonna help me.

13:22.456 --> 13:25.180
You're right. I'm sorry. It's just...

13:28.184 --> 13:29.766
Never mind, I should be going.

13:29.866 --> 13:31.909
What were you gonna say?

13:33.711 --> 13:35.713
Nothing.

13:37.155 --> 13:38.577
You haven't by any chance...

13:38.677 --> 13:41.161
I know this is gonna sound
a little weird.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.385
- been hearing things lately,
have you?

13:44.485 --> 13:46.748
- Hearing things?
- Yeah, you know, like,

13:46.848 --> 13:49.351
I could swear a couple times today,
I heard a...

13:49.451 --> 13:51.454
- A baby?
- You too?

13:52.455 --> 13:54.458
Pretty strange, huh?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.682
- Do you think it means anything?
- I don't know.

13:57.782 --> 14:00.906
I mean, maybe it's just that
we both regret not having children.

14:02.829 --> 14:04.832
Which... Why didn't we?

14:05.593 --> 14:08.396
I don't know. We both wanted to.

14:10.078 --> 14:12.462
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

14:12.562 --> 14:14.424
Piper, we need you upstairs!

14:14.524 --> 14:16.527
Be right there.

14:18.369 --> 14:19.551
You should probably go.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.055
But what if you need help?
What if it's a demon?

14:23.376 --> 14:26.400
Leo, you're not our whitelighter
anymore. Chris is.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.282
Except he's busy.

14:28.382 --> 14:31.406
I gave him another witch
to look after yesterday.

14:31.506 --> 14:35.151
Well, then I guess we're just gonna
have to handle it alone, won't we?

14:39.116 --> 14:41.740
So you're saying you started a riot
but you don't remember it?

14:41.840 --> 14:43.542
Yeah, it must have been
how this happened,

14:43.642 --> 14:45.304
and why Elise was so mad at me.

14:45.405 --> 14:47.227
I thought Elise was just like that.

14:47.327 --> 14:48.989
Well, yeah, she kind of is.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.511
Hey, you okay?

14:50.611 --> 14:52.834
I'm feeling a very emotional vibe
from you right now.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.837
I'm fine. Stop that.

14:54.937 --> 14:57.721
What I don't understand is,
if you don't remember the riot,

14:57.821 --> 14:59.203
how do you know you started it?

14:59.303 --> 15:02.827
I had a vision. And by the way,
the vision occurred yesterday.

15:03.148 --> 15:05.331
Maybe you were channelling
somebody else's anger.

15:05.431 --> 15:07.574
Probably, I just don't remember.

15:07.674 --> 15:11.118
So you both have events that
you can't remember from yesterday.

15:11.439 --> 15:13.621
Yeah, there was the riot,
and Paige's blouse.

15:13.722 --> 15:16.886
And this thing with this girl Flo
from work. Did you forget anything?

15:17.567 --> 15:20.370
You're asking me to remember
what I've apparently forgotten?

15:21.131 --> 15:26.258
I don't know. I remember getting up,
I remember going downstairs,

15:26.618 --> 15:28.561
but the rest is kind of a blur.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.524
I think somebody's messing with us.

15:30.624 --> 15:31.765
Making us forget.

15:31.865 --> 15:34.689
But these all seem
like such random moments to forget.

15:34.789 --> 15:35.891
Where's the connection?

15:35.991 --> 15:40.116
Well, that's why we wrote a spell:
to fill in the blanks.

15:40.957 --> 15:43.220
We know you might be reluctant
because of what happened

15:43.320 --> 15:45.223
the last time we cast a spell
on your memory...

15:45.323 --> 15:47.326
No, you're right. Let's do it.

15:47.926 --> 15:49.709
- Really?
- Something's going on.

15:49.809 --> 15:51.912
The only thing
we don't know is what.

15:52.012 --> 15:53.474
All right, here we go.

15:53.574 --> 15:55.356
<i>"Moments lost make witches wonder</i>

15:55.456 --> 15:57.839
<i>Warlocks plot or demons plunder</i>

15:57.939 --> 15:59.321
<i>If this is not a prank</i>

15:59.421 --> 16:01.424
<i>Help us to fill in the blanks"</i>

16:07.592 --> 16:08.693
It's raining.

16:08.794 --> 16:09.895
Hey, your Band-Aid's gone.

16:09.995 --> 16:11.858
And you're wearing that blouse.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.401
Except for I've got no coffee stain.

16:15.843 --> 16:17.845
Oh, my God.

16:27.458 --> 16:31.023
I remember now. I'm a mom.

16:38.392 --> 16:40.095
Today is yesterday.

16:40.195 --> 16:43.018
Well, the spell didn't return our
memories, it just rewound the day.

16:43.118 --> 16:44.220
Yeah, but why?

16:44.320 --> 16:47.925
Why else? To help us remember what
somebody obviously wants us to forget.

16:48.245 --> 16:50.949
Okay, but how could I have possibly
forgotten about Wyatt?

16:51.049 --> 16:52.951
What could have happened
to make that happen?

16:53.051 --> 16:55.835
Piper, it's not just you.
We were all made to forget about him.

16:55.935 --> 16:57.517
And a whole bunch of other things.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.902
But I'm his mother,
it's my job to protect him and I failed.

17:01.222 --> 17:03.225
Don't be ridiculous, you did not fail.

17:03.785 --> 17:07.550
Okay, now he's fussing.
Come on, sweetie, it's okay.

17:07.871 --> 17:10.094
And now I can't get him
to stop fussing.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.195
Well, you're just feeling insecure.

17:12.757 --> 17:14.760
And Wyatt is feeling...

17:16.122 --> 17:18.124
...very, very sad right now.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.689
Poor little guy. See, this is why
I lock myself in the basement.

17:22.009 --> 17:23.671
I am a wreck.

17:23.771 --> 17:25.753
Okay, we're kind of against
the clock right now.

17:25.854 --> 17:27.916
Maybe we should just
take it into the other room.

17:28.017 --> 17:31.462
- I think that's a good idea.
- Okay, bud, here we go.

17:32.383 --> 17:33.885
Here we go, okay.

17:33.985 --> 17:35.807
Hey, lookie, how about this?

17:35.907 --> 17:39.052
You like this guy? Hello. No?

17:39.152 --> 17:40.534
Pheebs, a little help here.

17:40.634 --> 17:43.618
We hate that toy.
It's yucky and crusty and gross.

17:43.718 --> 17:45.840
Okay, then what does he want?

17:47.883 --> 17:49.886
That.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.988
Yeah, see, I am a failure.

17:52.089 --> 17:54.852
No, you're not. We just happen to have
more pressing concerns right now

17:55.173 --> 17:56.595
than the media's influence.

17:56.695 --> 17:58.697
Okay?

18:01.020 --> 18:02.963
Okay.

18:03.063 --> 18:04.485
<i>R- E-D.</i>

18:04.585 --> 18:09.031
Okay, sweetie, Mommy will just
be in the next room okay? Okay.

18:09.391 --> 18:13.837
<i>O- R-A-N-G-E. Orange.</i>

18:14.198 --> 18:16.881
<i>G- R-E-E-N. Green.</i>

18:20.526 --> 18:22.769
<i>- on the uneven parallel bars...</i>

18:28.336 --> 18:30.959
Okay, we remember everything
that happened before today, right?

18:31.060 --> 18:32.161
Yeah, but...

18:32.261 --> 18:35.125
And we're not gonna remember
everything unless we do something.

18:35.225 --> 18:36.887
Paige, don't be impatient with me.

18:36.987 --> 18:39.771
I'm feeling so much today,
I don't need this too.

18:39.871 --> 18:41.573
Okay, all I'm saying is,

18:41.673 --> 18:43.736
whatever caused us to forget
is gonna happen next.

18:43.836 --> 18:46.139
We just have to relive this day
and see where it leads.

18:46.239 --> 18:48.142
Yeah, but if we're not careful,
where it leads

18:48.242 --> 18:50.385
will be right back where
we started, without Wyatt.

18:50.485 --> 18:52.708
Except we know something
is gonna happen to him,

18:52.808 --> 18:54.430
so all we have to do
is look for clues,

18:54.530 --> 18:56.393
keep our eyes open and stop it.

18:56.493 --> 18:58.435
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

18:58.535 --> 19:00.838
It's all important
because it's all connected to Wyatt,

19:00.939 --> 19:02.601
so we just have to see
the connection.

19:02.701 --> 19:04.483
So you're supposed
to go to your temp job

19:04.583 --> 19:06.406
and wait for coffee
to be spilled on you?

19:06.506 --> 19:08.689
Yeah, exactly. So much
for my life outside of magic.

19:08.789 --> 19:10.411
Now, you,
you have got to go to work...

19:10.511 --> 19:14.356
Start a riot and get a cut on my head
and lose my job? No, thank you.

19:14.717 --> 19:17.360
You have to.
It's the only way to save Wyatt.

19:50.964 --> 19:53.007
So I guess I'm supposed
to stay home...

19:53.928 --> 19:55.931
Wyatt?

20:02.419 --> 20:04.422
How did those open?

20:04.982 --> 20:06.645
Must have been the wind.

20:06.745 --> 20:08.086
But they were locked.

20:08.187 --> 20:09.889
Could be a clue, let's remember it.

20:09.989 --> 20:12.612
- You gonna be okay here by yourself?
- Do I have a choice?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.935
Wanna switch with me?

20:15.035 --> 20:17.038
Okay, just call us
if anything weird happens.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.393
<i>You're kidding, right?</i>

20:28.493 --> 20:30.836
I don't have time for another charge.

20:30.936 --> 20:33.760
- Why not?
- Because I just don't.

20:33.860 --> 20:36.123
Why do you want me to oversee
another witch, anyway?

20:36.223 --> 20:39.447
Because I want to see
what you can do, what you can handle.

20:39.548 --> 20:42.371
Oh, please, you just don't want me
around the sisters all the time

20:42.471 --> 20:44.454
because you don't trust me.

20:44.554 --> 20:47.498
Chris, protecting charges
is what we do.

20:47.598 --> 20:51.083
And besides, when I was
a whitelighter, I had other charges.

20:51.403 --> 20:54.026
Leo, I didn't come all the way
from the future

20:54.127 --> 20:56.910
to protect and oversee
other charges.

20:57.010 --> 20:59.133
I came for one reason,
and one reason only.

20:59.614 --> 21:02.317
- To protect Wyatt.
- Yeah.

21:02.417 --> 21:05.041
From some demon
who will attack in the future

21:05.141 --> 21:06.443
but you're not sure which one.

21:06.543 --> 21:08.926
Hey, man, fine, whatever.
Don't believe me.

21:09.026 --> 21:12.991
All I'm saying is, there is no way I'm
taking on another charge and that's...

21:14.233 --> 21:16.235
...that.

21:16.636 --> 21:19.320
- Hi, Leo, sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

21:22.524 --> 21:24.526
You must be Chris.

21:25.928 --> 21:27.931
I'm Natalie.

21:28.892 --> 21:30.895
Maybe just one more.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.163
Phoebe, thank God you came in.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.085
The server crashed
and we lost your column.

21:39.185 --> 21:41.669
- Do you have a hard copy?
- I'll check in my office.

21:42.310 --> 21:44.372
It's not what you did, Elise,
it's how you did it.

21:44.472 --> 21:46.735
Well, lucky I'm editor.
I don't care what you think.

21:46.835 --> 21:49.038
- Don't think we're done here, mister!
- Screw you, Elise!

22:00.213 --> 22:02.216
You think that's funny, huh?

22:05.059 --> 22:07.543
Hold it! Wait! Don't!

22:14.231 --> 22:18.517
Stay calm, just stay calm. Just,
you know, tell me what happened.

22:18.877 --> 22:21.821
Mr. Stewick has been asking me out
ever since I got here.

22:21.921 --> 22:24.705
- Okay, so you went on a date.
- Well, if you could call it a date.

22:24.805 --> 22:27.068
He tried to grab my ass,
I threw a drink in his face.

22:27.168 --> 22:29.151
I have avoided him ever since.
I'm so stupid!

22:29.251 --> 22:31.634
I shouldn't have gone out with him
in the first place.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.837
Okay, so tell me
what happened next.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.921
Next. Next, he wants me
to meet him in his office

22:37.021 --> 22:39.024
tomorrow morning, bright and early.

22:39.384 --> 22:41.447
He says it's official.

22:41.547 --> 22:45.392
I need this job, but I'm afraid
to face him alone.

22:45.752 --> 22:47.735
Do you think
you could come with me?

22:47.835 --> 22:50.539
Of course, absolutely.

22:50.639 --> 22:52.742
I don't know how I could forget this.

22:52.842 --> 22:54.344
Forget what?

22:54.444 --> 22:56.587
Oh, nothing.

22:56.687 --> 22:59.070
Well, this is just so typical
of my luck with men.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.914
I mean, not that you need
to hear me complain but...

23:02.014 --> 23:04.016
Oh, hey, watch out.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.281
- Coffee.
- I am so sorry. l...

23:07.381 --> 23:09.644
- It's okay.
- It's just, something...

23:09.744 --> 23:11.526
...weird just flew by the window.
It's...

23:11.626 --> 23:13.629
Something, something what?

23:15.071 --> 23:16.172
Spit it out, spit it out.

23:16.272 --> 23:19.477
Well, to be honest with you,
it looked a little like a...

23:20.438 --> 23:22.220
...a dragon.

23:22.320 --> 23:24.323
A dragon.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.412
Oh, that is so not good.

23:33.215 --> 23:34.797
All right, sweetie, come on.

23:34.897 --> 23:38.421
Mommy's gotta find something
to make sure nothing happens to you.

23:38.782 --> 23:40.784
Here. Look, look, look.

23:41.105 --> 23:43.848
Right, you hate this. You hate this.

23:43.949 --> 23:47.113
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:47.433 --> 23:50.557
Did I forget
how to be a mommy too?

23:51.839 --> 23:55.083
Wyatt, what are you doing? Wyatt.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.455
Oh, my God!

24:17.873 --> 24:19.255
You son of a bitch!

24:19.355 --> 24:21.778
Phoebe! No! Phoebe! No!

24:21.878 --> 24:22.980
Snap out of it!

24:23.080 --> 24:25.523
Oh, no, did I do all this?

24:26.404 --> 24:28.867
Forget all that,
we gotta get out of here.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.511
Phoebe, I figured out what
we're supposed to be remembering.

24:31.611 --> 24:33.954
I'd be happier just forgetting,
I think, at this point.

24:34.054 --> 24:37.298
No, no, you wouldn't. Phoebe,
there's a dragon loose in the city!

24:37.619 --> 24:39.621
Did you say dragon?

24:41.103 --> 24:43.106
Come on.

24:50.476 --> 24:52.618
Wyatt, you're making Mommy
very nervous.

24:52.718 --> 24:54.100
What are we doing here?

24:54.200 --> 24:56.203
What is it?

24:57.845 --> 24:59.387
<i>- What's up?</i>
<i>- Where are you?</i>

24:59.487 --> 25:00.589
Where am I?

25:00.689 --> 25:02.471
I'm standing outside
of the Presidio tunnel

25:02.571 --> 25:03.993
where your nephew just orbed me.

25:04.093 --> 25:06.096
<i>What did you just say?</i>

25:06.737 --> 25:08.679
He did what?

25:08.779 --> 25:11.403
Are you out of your mind?
Aren't you afraid of exposure?

25:11.503 --> 25:13.205
Yeah, that's why we called.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.668
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

25:18.873 --> 25:20.875
I think she's talking about that.

25:33.051 --> 25:35.835
<i>Police here at the tunnel are saying</i>
<i>it's a miracle no one was hurt</i>

25:35.935 --> 25:37.958
<i>although three cars were destroyed.</i>

25:38.058 --> 25:41.102
<i>They haven't ruled out terrorism,</i>
<i>of course, but at the moment,</i>

25:41.422 --> 25:44.046
<i>they are focusing</i>
<i>on some rather bizarre reports</i>

25:44.146 --> 25:48.832
<i>of a giant bird, which one witness</i>
<i>went on record as saying:</i>

25:49.232 --> 25:53.037
<i>"Shot fire out of its mouth at cars,</i>
<i>like a dragon. "</i>

25:55.721 --> 25:59.606
Well, as far as clues go, I'd say that's
a pretty huge one, wouldn't you?

26:00.327 --> 26:01.989
- Sorry.
- No,

26:02.089 --> 26:04.993
it's not my pain I'm reacting to,
it's your pain.

26:05.093 --> 26:08.658
Oh, well, then you should be feeling
a little irritated then too.

26:08.978 --> 26:11.582
Piper, why are you blaming yourself?
It's not your fault.

26:12.182 --> 26:15.006
Okay, number one, I haven't
actually verbalized guilt yet.

26:15.106 --> 26:17.790
So in the future, let me confess
before you analyse.

26:18.350 --> 26:19.492
Right.

26:19.592 --> 26:22.175
Secondly, it is my fault because
I'm the one that plopped Wyatt

26:22.276 --> 26:24.278
in front of the electronic babysitter.

26:24.919 --> 26:28.043
- Any idea what she's talking about?
- No, not a clue.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.588
You want some clues,
try this one on for size.

26:31.688 --> 26:36.294
Before you left, Wyatt was watching a
TV show about... Wait for it... . dragons.

26:36.815 --> 26:38.156
Oh, he was watching a kid show.

26:38.256 --> 26:40.640
Well, apparently
he magically changed the channel.

26:40.740 --> 26:43.603
Of course, that was before
he magically orbed me to the tunnel

26:43.704 --> 26:45.866
- to find his new friend.
- He did all of that?

26:47.068 --> 26:51.273
Wait a second. So you're saying
Wyatt conjured a dragon.

26:51.834 --> 26:53.817
Yep, right out of the TV.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.579
Oh, you must be so proud!

26:55.679 --> 26:58.223
- Yeah, or a little irritated.
- Right.

26:58.323 --> 27:01.687
Okay, if this is true, your little boy
is developing some serious powers.

27:02.007 --> 27:05.772
Yeah, the kind that unleashes
Godzilla on an unsuspecting city.

27:06.093 --> 27:08.236
How am I supposed to handle this?

27:08.336 --> 27:10.919
Well, at least now we know
how we lost our memories.

27:11.019 --> 27:13.162
I mean, obviously, anything
connected to the dragon,

27:13.262 --> 27:15.805
no matter how remote, was erased.

27:15.906 --> 27:18.369
You know, what, coffee stains, riots.

27:18.469 --> 27:20.211
The question is by whom?

27:20.311 --> 27:24.156
Come on, you guys. So Wyatt
made a little magical mess.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.280
- We've dealt with worse, we'll fix it.
- Perhaps we can help.

27:32.688 --> 27:35.812
- Who are you?
- We're known as the Cleaners.

27:36.452 --> 27:38.675
- And we're here to help.
- The Cleaners?

27:38.776 --> 27:40.558
When magic is exposed,

27:40.658 --> 27:42.240
we're the ones who cover it up,

27:42.340 --> 27:43.922
remove all evidence.

27:44.022 --> 27:46.666
Erase any memories,
whatever is necessary.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.249
You're the ones
who are going to take Wyatt.

27:49.349 --> 27:52.834
Well, we won't have to
if you can eliminate the exposure risk.

27:53.154 --> 27:57.520
Exposure? You're here to take
my son away, you son of a bitch!

28:00.484 --> 28:03.348
I understand your anger.

28:03.448 --> 28:06.231
Now you need
to understand our position.

28:06.332 --> 28:07.834
We're a neutral party.

28:07.934 --> 28:10.677
We exist only to protect magic.

28:10.777 --> 28:14.502
To that end,
your son has become... a problem.

28:15.624 --> 28:17.206
- Easy.
- However,

28:17.306 --> 28:20.510
based upon your past success
in covering up your own magic,

28:20.830 --> 28:23.013
we've decided to give you a chance...

28:23.113 --> 28:24.495
One chance only.

28:24.595 --> 28:28.400
...to take care of the problem
yourselves before it gets out of hand.

28:28.721 --> 28:30.723
And if we can't?

28:31.164 --> 28:33.207
Then we'll have to
take care of it for you.

28:34.448 --> 28:37.312
You can't make us forget everything.

28:37.412 --> 28:39.555
There may be some
distant echoes that remain,

28:39.655 --> 28:42.499
maybe a sense of dÐ¹jÐ° vu
here and there,

28:42.819 --> 28:44.121
but like most people,

28:44.221 --> 28:46.844
you'll just pass it off
as absent-mindedness and move on.

28:46.945 --> 28:49.528
- Well, we're not like most people.
- It won't matter.

28:49.628 --> 28:51.631
Clean it up.

28:52.191 --> 28:54.194
Or we will.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.382
At least now
we know what happened.

29:00.482 --> 29:02.785
Too bad we just
won't remember any of it.

29:02.885 --> 29:05.869
All right, I think we have
the upper hand on this one, don't we?

29:05.969 --> 29:10.535
I mean, we know that we're recalling
the same day, they obviously don't.

29:10.896 --> 29:14.100
None of this is gonna help unless
we can eliminate Wyatt's dragon.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.323
<i>- Piper.</i>
<i>- Go to the Book, work on the dragon.</i>

29:16.423 --> 29:17.845
Do not take your eyes off Wyatt.

29:17.945 --> 29:19.087
Where are you going?

29:19.187 --> 29:21.189
To call a higher power.

29:22.791 --> 29:26.917
Leo! Leo, I know you can hear me.

29:27.277 --> 29:30.221
I know I told you to go away,
but I really need you.

29:30.321 --> 29:32.484
Wyatt's in trouble!

29:34.046 --> 29:35.348
What do you mean?
What happened?

29:35.448 --> 29:37.611
There's no time, just tell me
how to stop the Cleaners.

29:38.252 --> 29:40.995
The Cleaners? Are they after him?

29:41.095 --> 29:42.197
Yeah.

29:42.297 --> 29:43.479
What the hell happened?

29:43.579 --> 29:46.302
Well, he conjured a little dragon.

29:46.623 --> 29:48.205
Piper, how could you
let that happen?

29:48.305 --> 29:50.327
How could I let that happen?

29:50.428 --> 29:53.752
You take off and suddenly
I'm responsible for every little thing?

29:54.072 --> 29:55.494
This is not a little thing.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.417
Yeah, well,
where the hell were you?

29:57.517 --> 29:59.379
Why weren't you watching over
his every move

29:59.479 --> 30:00.981
up there on your lofty perch?

30:01.082 --> 30:02.423
Okay, that's not what I meant.

30:02.523 --> 30:05.267
Then don't say it, because I'm beating
myself up enough about this

30:05.367 --> 30:08.011
and I don't need you
beating me up too.

30:09.452 --> 30:11.455
Sorry.

30:12.376 --> 30:13.878
I'm just scared.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.902
Yeah, so am I.
That's why I called you.

30:17.223 --> 30:19.966
Because I'm about to lose our son
and I don't know what to do.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.929
So please help me!

30:22.029 --> 30:23.531
- Piper, if I could...
- No.

30:23.631 --> 30:26.495
Don't say it, don't say anything
about Elders or rules,

30:26.595 --> 30:28.577
because you know what?
He is your son, Leo.

30:28.678 --> 30:29.859
There are no rules.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.943
I'm telling you, the Cleaners
are empowered by both good and evil.

30:33.043 --> 30:35.306
- You can't stop them.
- There has to be a way.

30:35.406 --> 30:37.629
You don't understand, there isn't.

30:37.729 --> 30:40.954
Cleaners have the power
to rewrite history, you can't fight that.

30:41.054 --> 30:45.059
No, you don't understand!
I can't do this! I cannot lose Wyatt too!

30:45.540 --> 30:48.203
Piper, you weren't
put in this position to lose Wyatt,

30:48.303 --> 30:51.087
which means there is a way,
you just have to find it.

30:51.187 --> 30:53.190
- But how?
- I don't know.

30:53.991 --> 30:55.993
But if anybody can find it, you can.

30:57.435 --> 31:00.019
You know, maybe
it's not a magical solution.

31:00.119 --> 31:02.121
Maybe it's...

31:02.642 --> 31:04.384
...maternal.

31:04.484 --> 31:07.689
Deep down inside, you can find it.

31:08.490 --> 31:10.492
I know you can.

31:20.906 --> 31:22.528
Hey, you all right?

31:22.628 --> 31:25.292
I don't know. Ask me again
when this is all over.

31:25.392 --> 31:28.055
- Was Leo any help?
- I'm not sure yet.

31:28.155 --> 31:29.257
Anything on the dragon?

31:29.357 --> 31:32.381
<i>No, dragons predate the Book.</i>

31:32.481 --> 31:35.265
One thing I do know is that
we're gonna have to get a tooth, scale,

31:35.365 --> 31:38.289
some piece of him in order to make
the vanquishing potion even work.

31:38.609 --> 31:40.151
Yeah, we're just kind of winging it,

31:40.251 --> 31:43.075
making the most powerful potion
that we can.

31:43.175 --> 31:45.178
- Phoebe?
- What happened? Are you all right?

31:46.059 --> 31:48.061
I am, but someone's not.

31:48.622 --> 31:50.725
Actually a bunch of people aren't.

31:50.825 --> 31:52.848
People?
Like people out there, people?

31:52.948 --> 31:57.474
I don't know. All I know is I've never
felt such pain and fear before in my life.

31:57.834 --> 32:00.658
- Is it the dragon?
- Grab the potion.

32:00.758 --> 32:02.921
Wyatt, sweetie, come on.

32:03.802 --> 32:06.065
Remember your friend, Mr. Dragon?

32:06.165 --> 32:08.368
What do you say
we find the dragon?

32:10.170 --> 32:12.533
Look out! Look out!

32:16.058 --> 32:18.061
Get out of here!

32:19.943 --> 32:21.886
Get... Get back in here!

32:21.986 --> 32:23.728
Get down!

32:23.828 --> 32:25.090
Run!

32:25.190 --> 32:27.193
Hurry, come on!

32:28.634 --> 32:30.417
Help! Help!

32:30.517 --> 32:33.000
God, it looks like a war zone.

32:41.211 --> 32:43.874
Oh, God, looks like it made a nest.

32:43.974 --> 32:45.977
Let's hope it's not laying any eggs.

32:48.380 --> 32:50.243
Think you can steal
a scale for the potion?

32:50.343 --> 32:53.347
I'll try. Scale!

32:57.993 --> 33:00.716
- I think I woke it up.
- No, I think you pissed it off.

33:10.169 --> 33:13.693
Okay, if you're sensing any fear,
it would be mine.

33:14.334 --> 33:16.277
- I think we should go.
- Wait.

33:16.377 --> 33:18.780
- Wait for what?
- Wyatt.

33:19.861 --> 33:21.003
Piper, what are you doing?

33:21.103 --> 33:23.005
No time to explain,
just make sure he sees me.

33:23.106 --> 33:25.108
Piper, come back!

33:30.916 --> 33:33.800
Come on, you fire-breathing lizard,
come and get me!

33:37.765 --> 33:39.787
- Piper, are you nuts?
- Stay there.

33:39.888 --> 33:41.890
We have to stop her.

33:43.973 --> 33:45.955
I think I know what she's doing.

33:46.056 --> 33:48.058
Come on, Wyatt,
don't let Mommy down.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.819
Piper!

34:03.919 --> 34:07.203
I'm okay. I'm okay.

34:07.524 --> 34:10.327
Hi, little man, you did it!

34:10.648 --> 34:13.351
I knew you could do it. Good job.

34:13.451 --> 34:15.554
Okay, I'm confused.
What just happened?

34:15.654 --> 34:17.757
That was the greatest
power there is.

34:17.857 --> 34:19.920
A mother-and-child bond.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.601
Especially when that child is Wyatt.

34:21.702 --> 34:23.565
So you're saying
he vanquished the dragon,

34:23.665 --> 34:25.246
and you knew he was gonna do it.

34:25.347 --> 34:28.511
Well, I was hoping he wouldn't want
anything bad to happen to me.

34:29.391 --> 34:33.518
Okay, well that solved that problem.
Now what do we do with this mess?

34:33.838 --> 34:37.683
- We'll figure it out.
- No, actually, you won't.

34:39.324 --> 34:41.547
Wait, we did what you asked,
we got rid of the dragon.

34:41.648 --> 34:43.650
But not the exposure risk.

34:44.452 --> 34:47.295
- The boy.
- No, you can't.

34:52.543 --> 34:54.645
We don't have much time,
they're gonna follow us.

34:54.745 --> 34:57.007
- How do we stop them?
- We have to think of something.

34:57.108 --> 34:59.111
We can't just let them take Wyatt.

35:00.032 --> 35:02.035
Incoming!

35:03.076 --> 35:05.079
I will not lose him.

35:10.246 --> 35:12.248
No!

35:13.971 --> 35:15.152
Don't worry.

35:15.252 --> 35:17.936
You won't remember
any of this anyway.

35:30.752 --> 35:32.014
Do you remember?

35:32.114 --> 35:33.616
Absolutely everything.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.459
The spell must have worked.

35:35.559 --> 35:39.204
But not for Wyatt. He's gone.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.013
Nothing. I can't find
the Cleaners anywhere.

36:02.113 --> 36:04.096
Well, they have to exist
somewhere, don't they?

36:04.196 --> 36:07.921
Not necessarily. Not even
on our plane, not even in our time.

36:08.241 --> 36:09.783
Maybe we should
just summon them.

36:09.884 --> 36:11.946
- And then what?
- I don't know.

36:12.046 --> 36:13.468
Maybe we should call Leo again.

36:13.568 --> 36:15.791
I don't think he can help
more than he already has.

36:15.891 --> 36:19.216
- How did he help last time?
- By reminding me that I can do this.

36:21.899 --> 36:24.443
You know, maybe we are
going about this all wrong.

36:24.543 --> 36:26.205
Maybe instead of trying to stop them,

36:26.305 --> 36:28.568
we should be trying to get them
to stop us.

36:28.668 --> 36:29.850
You lost me.

36:29.950 --> 36:31.452
Well, when magic is exposed,

36:31.552 --> 36:34.456
- it's their job to clean it up, right?
- Yeah, so?

36:34.556 --> 36:37.500
So why can't we expose our magic
and force them to deal with us?

36:37.600 --> 36:41.445
Yeah, but if we do that,
what's to stop them from erasing us?

36:41.805 --> 36:43.588
They wouldn't dare.

36:43.688 --> 36:46.451
So let's give them
something to clean up.

36:47.653 --> 36:49.876
The Doppler radar for the Bay Area
shows us that storm

36:49.976 --> 36:51.278
is already on its way out.

36:51.378 --> 36:54.902
So looks like San Francisco
is finally gonna get some good news.

36:55.223 --> 36:58.427
Those scattered showers overnight
turning partly sunny by morn...

36:58.747 --> 37:01.491
- Whoa! What the...?
- Hi. How you doing?

37:01.591 --> 37:03.754
Why don't we get a skycam view
of that, shall we?

37:06.317 --> 37:08.220
Help! Get me down from here!

37:08.320 --> 37:10.343
Don't... Don't let go! Don't let go!

37:10.443 --> 37:12.505
I don't know
what's happening here, l...

37:12.606 --> 37:14.608
Well, it's called magic, Kaneisha.

37:15.249 --> 37:16.871
Witchcraft, specifically.

37:16.971 --> 37:18.974
I really love your jacket!

37:25.623 --> 37:26.764
Want to see more magic?

37:26.864 --> 37:29.207
Let's check in with Piper
at the Golden Gate Bridge.

37:29.307 --> 37:31.310
Take it away, Piper!

37:34.514 --> 37:36.977
<i>Let the object of objection</i>
<i>Become but a dream</i>

37:37.078 --> 37:40.282
<i>As I cause the scene</i>
<i>To become unseen</i>

37:43.646 --> 37:47.211
<i>You might want to take an alternate</i>
<i>route to work in the morning.</i>

37:50.936 --> 37:53.439
Not so bad. You should
get out more often.

37:53.539 --> 37:55.482
Yeah, Pheebs,
time to come out of the basement.

37:55.582 --> 37:57.084
Maybe you're right.

37:57.184 --> 37:59.567
What do you think you're doing?

37:59.667 --> 38:01.730
Are you out of your minds?

38:01.830 --> 38:03.372
Oh, hey, hi.

38:03.472 --> 38:05.455
Did you see our little magic act?

38:05.555 --> 38:07.177
How is it you still
have your memory?

38:07.277 --> 38:10.481
Oh, I think we still have a few
surprises that you don't know about.

38:10.802 --> 38:12.544
Yeah, and if you don't
return our nephew,

38:12.644 --> 38:14.547
you might found out about
just a few more.

38:14.647 --> 38:16.149
This is pointless.

38:16.249 --> 38:19.032
Whatever you do, we'll simply erase.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.756
- Or we'll erase you.
- You can't.

38:21.856 --> 38:23.999
Not if you're truly neutral, that is.

38:24.099 --> 38:25.761
Because, you see,
if you get rid of us,

38:25.861 --> 38:28.445
you tip the balance of power
from good to evil.

38:28.545 --> 38:30.988
And now, that's hardly
being neutral, now is it?

38:32.270 --> 38:33.932
You will give me my son back.

38:34.032 --> 38:37.256
Or I swear to you, the only thing
you will be doing for the next 50 years,

38:37.356 --> 38:39.399
is cleaning up after us.

38:43.244 --> 38:46.769
If we do return him, how do you know
you'll be able to control him?

38:47.089 --> 38:49.893
I'm his mother.
If anybody can, I can.

39:02.790 --> 39:05.733
Everything is as it was.

39:05.834 --> 39:07.896
We've erased all evidence
of your son's magic.

39:07.996 --> 39:12.202
- We'll leave him in your care.
- For now.

39:14.165 --> 39:16.027
Oh, one more thing.

39:16.127 --> 39:19.031
Please, if you could just do me
a little, teensy-weensy little favour

39:19.131 --> 39:21.374
and erase that whole riot
I caused at the office.

39:22.215 --> 39:25.079
Because I don't want to lose my job.
That would really suck.

39:25.179 --> 39:28.944
Might throw off that balance thing
because I'd be distracted, you know.

39:30.746 --> 39:32.749
It's done.

39:33.149 --> 39:34.892
Good luck.

39:34.992 --> 39:38.476
Because, believe me,
you're going to need it.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.982
You're okay.
I'm so happy to see you.

39:43.082 --> 39:45.546
- Don't smash him.
- I'm so happy to see you.

39:45.646 --> 39:50.332
I can't help it, this is just very exciting.
He's back. We're back.

39:50.692 --> 39:51.794
Coffee stain and all.

39:51.894 --> 39:54.637
Yeah, what are you gonna do
about your job, are you gonna keep it?

39:54.738 --> 39:57.541
Yeah, I think I will,
just so I can see what happens next.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.021
Exactly what are you saying?

40:13.122 --> 40:16.967
Unless you make it worth my while...

40:17.287 --> 40:19.971
...I may find
your performance here...

40:20.571 --> 40:21.673
...lacking.

40:21.773 --> 40:25.257
Mr. Stewick, please, I need this job.

40:25.578 --> 40:27.861
And that is why I'm giving
you an opportunity to keep it.

40:28.942 --> 40:30.945
If you catch my meaning.

40:35.511 --> 40:37.413
Absolutely.

40:37.513 --> 40:39.656
You know, I like a man
who knows what he wants

40:39.756 --> 40:42.500
and isn't afraid to ask for it.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.804
Now are you afraid to come get it?

40:49.249 --> 40:51.692
You mean, right here and now?

40:52.813 --> 40:54.816
Yeah?

40:58.301 --> 41:01.024
<i>- Yeah, hold my calls, please.</i>
<i>- Yes, Mr. Stewick.</i>

41:02.346 --> 41:04.349
Flower pot!

41:15.043 --> 41:18.928
Oh, Paige, I thought you were...

41:22.693 --> 41:24.074
What happened?

41:24.174 --> 41:27.098
Well, you see, I overheard
Mr. Stewick threatening you.

41:27.419 --> 41:30.062
He'll be real lucky if you don't sue.

41:30.623 --> 41:32.626
Just go with it.

41:34.949 --> 41:38.553
Thanks, Paige, for whatever
you just did for me in here.

41:38.874 --> 41:42.318
I was wondering why I took this job,
and now I know.

41:42.639 --> 41:45.482
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:49.728 --> 41:52.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:52.291 --> 41:53.873
I didn't know you were coming here.

41:53.973 --> 41:55.515
What are you still doing here, Chris?

41:55.616 --> 41:57.718
Shouldn't you be getting
to know your new charge?

41:57.818 --> 41:59.601
Yeah, about that.

41:59.701 --> 42:03.586
I'm... I'm going back
to what I originally said.

42:03.946 --> 42:05.849
I don't have time for her.

42:05.949 --> 42:07.932
- Chris.
- Leo, I mean it.

42:08.032 --> 42:10.795
Because whether you believe me
or not, I'm here to protect Wyatt.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.098
Not other charges.

42:13.199 --> 42:15.421
Other than the sisters, of course.

42:15.522 --> 42:17.644
If that's how you feel,
I guess I'll reassign her.

42:18.325 --> 42:20.328
Thank you.
