03:30.747 --> 03:32.568
Here's what I found out.

03:32.664 --> 03:36.308
That all of life is
a learning experience.

03:36.405 --> 03:38.610
Everything is part of a big...

03:38.706 --> 03:40.336
master plan.

03:41.390 --> 03:44.556
But sometimes it's--
Well, it's hard to read.

03:44.651 --> 03:47.241
It's like if you get
too close to the screen...

03:47.336 --> 03:49.830
all you can see
is a bunch of little dots.

03:49.925 --> 03:52.995
You don 't see the big picture
until you stand back.

03:53.091 --> 03:55.008
But when you do...

03:55.104 --> 03:57.215
everything comes into focus.

04:01.145 --> 04:03.063
My name is Suzanne Maretto.

04:04.502 --> 04:06.228
No, wait. I'm sorry.

04:06.228 --> 04:09.105
Suzanne Maretto
is my married name.

04:09.201 --> 04:10.831
My own name...

04:10.927 --> 04:13.134
is Suzanne Stone.

04:13.230 --> 04:14.956
That's my professional name.

04:20.230 --> 04:23.490
It's not like I have any negative
feelings about the name Maretto.

04:24.737 --> 04:27.519
Maretto is the name, after all...

04:27.615 --> 04:29.052
of my husband...

04:30.300 --> 04:31.834
who I loved...

04:31.834 --> 04:33.273
very, very much.

04:37.108 --> 04:38.451
Sorry.

04:39.697 --> 04:42.958
It's also the name of his parents,
Joe and Angela Maretto...

04:43.053 --> 04:45.738
and of his lovely and talented
sister, Janice Maretto...

04:46.889 --> 04:49.766
who have been like
a second family to me...

04:49.862 --> 04:52.261
and who I regard
as I do my own family...

04:53.699 --> 04:55.617
particularly since
my recent tragedy.

04:57.055 --> 05:00.507
I knew just through knowing
and being related to them.

05:01.466 --> 05:04.822
They have given me what I think is
a very precious and valuable insight...

05:04.822 --> 05:07.125
into the different kinds
of ethnic relationships...

05:07.125 --> 05:11.057
that are part of the very things
that I've been trying to explore...

05:11.057 --> 05:14.221
as a member
of the professional media.

05:22.661 --> 05:26.016
First impressions in one word?
You really want to know?

05:32.920 --> 05:35.319
Four letters, begins with C.'

05:35.415 --> 05:37.045
Larry, it's a girl.

05:38.196 --> 05:40.209
You ain't never seen one of them?

05:42.031 --> 05:43.375
'Cold.'

05:43.471 --> 05:44.908
Cold. C-O-I-D.

05:47.307 --> 05:48.937
Yeah.

05:49.033 --> 05:51.526
What did you think of Suzanne
when you first met her?

05:51.622 --> 05:54.499
I just didn't get
the Suzanne thing.

05:54.499 --> 05:57.375
All the girls around town
thought Larry was really cute.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.540
I mean, Larry used to hang out
at the restaurant...

06:00.637 --> 06:02.459
on the nights when my dad...

06:02.555 --> 06:05.336
would let Larry
and his dopey rock band play there.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.254
Just, you know?

06:20.870 --> 06:24.899
Oh, Susie Q
I love you

06:28.064 --> 06:30.173
I love the way you walk

06:31.802 --> 06:33.721
I love the way you talk

06:35.543 --> 06:39.858
I like the way you talk
I like the way you walk

06:45.422 --> 06:47.531
Laura Risley, I remember.

06:47.531 --> 06:49.927
Peggy Holden.
She was kind of a slut.

06:50.024 --> 06:52.805
He could've had anybody,
basically, is what I'm saying.

06:52.901 --> 06:55.490
I don't know. Suzanne-- blonde.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.216
I don't know.

07:04.793 --> 07:07.572
Well, yeah, sure,
I could've said some things.

07:08.627 --> 07:12.273
Well, to tell you the truth,
I did say some things.

07:12.273 --> 07:13.807
He's my brother.

07:13.903 --> 07:16.396
But in a very subtle way.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.944
What do you think
of Angela Raguzzo?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.766
She's all right.

07:21.862 --> 07:23.494
- She's hot.
- Why?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.944
She wants you to ask her out.

07:26.944 --> 07:30.781
Look, don't try and fix me up
with people. It's embarrassing.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.507
All right.

07:32.603 --> 07:34.904
What do you think of Dana Defalco?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.781
You want me to go out
with a girl whose father's in the mob?

07:37.877 --> 07:39.795
- Who says he's in the mob?
- Everybody.

07:39.891 --> 07:42.290
So? Don't you want
a little excitement?

07:42.290 --> 07:46.317
- I got all the excitement I can take.
- With who? The ice maiden?

07:46.413 --> 07:48.523
You don't know
what you're talking about.

07:48.617 --> 07:50.632
- I don't?
- No.

07:51.591 --> 07:53.413
Inform me.

07:53.509 --> 07:55.427
Well, it's none of your business.

07:55.523 --> 07:58.209
But Suzanne,
she looks, you know...

07:58.305 --> 08:00.127
very fragile and delicate, right?

08:02.141 --> 08:04.536
But when we're--

08:04.632 --> 08:08.470
I mean, when I'm--
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.387
Details are too graphic.

08:10.387 --> 08:12.976
But let me just tell ya,
she's like--

08:13.072 --> 08:15.565
She's like a volcano.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.115
You mean people come from miles around
just to watch her explode?

08:19.211 --> 08:21.321
- Is that it?
- Very funny.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.238
Like Mount Saint Helens?

08:23.333 --> 08:25.826
Man! When he says to me--

08:25.923 --> 08:27.361
I'm gonna marry her.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.717
Wait a minute. You what?

08:30.717 --> 08:33.019
'You what?' I said.
And then he says--

08:33.019 --> 08:35.705
I'm tellin' ya, sis, she's it.

08:35.801 --> 08:39.062
- She's the golden girl of my dreams.
- Oh, God.

08:41.171 --> 08:42.993
And I did one of these...

08:44.144 --> 08:45.966
which I regretted right away...

08:46.062 --> 08:49.898
'cause he looked at me with
that kind of doggy look that guys get.

08:51.048 --> 08:53.254
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding!

08:55.173 --> 08:57.091
She can't even bowl.

08:57.091 --> 08:58.721
Yes! Yes!

08:58.817 --> 09:01.500
- Let me tell you something, all right?
- Yeah.

09:01.596 --> 09:06.201
She's like--
She's like a delicate china doll.

09:06.201 --> 09:09.845
You ever try kissing a doll?
You know, they don't kiss back.

09:09.941 --> 09:13.489
She's like one of those
porcelain figurines that Mom collects.

09:14.927 --> 09:16.846
She is so pure and delicate...

09:17.996 --> 09:19.913
and innocent.

09:20.009 --> 09:22.791
You just have to look at her,
and you wanna take care of her...

09:22.886 --> 09:24.708
for the rest of your life.

09:26.434 --> 09:27.970
Yeah, I can see that.

09:29.504 --> 09:30.846
So--

09:30.942 --> 09:34.490
Anyway, so when she, Suzanne,
says to me--

09:34.490 --> 09:38.326
If you're actively seeking a career
in the professional ice skating field--

09:38.422 --> 09:40.149
in the spotlight, so to speak--

09:40.245 --> 09:43.217
I think you have to maximize
your positive features.

09:43.313 --> 09:44.655
Sure.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.533
What I'm saying is that
a qualified plastic surgeon...

09:47.629 --> 09:51.370
could just snip away those little
beauty spots, or facial blemishes...

09:51.465 --> 09:54.533
and you'd see how much better
you'd feel about yourself.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.519
You know, commenting about
my face and stuff.

09:59.519 --> 10:03.164
I knew where she was going.
Miss Fixer-Upper.

10:03.260 --> 10:06.808
I believe that Mr. Gorbachev--
The man who ran Russia for so long?

10:06.904 --> 10:10.070
I believe that he would still be
in power today if he'd done...

10:10.166 --> 10:14.193
what many people suggested and had that
big purple thing taken off his forehead.

10:14.193 --> 10:16.014
I firmly believe that.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.892
Someday I hope to interview him,
and we'll discuss that...

10:18.892 --> 10:21.865
along with other more pertinent
international things.

10:21.865 --> 10:25.221
I'm tellin' you, sis,
she's gonna be the next Barbara Walters.

10:25.317 --> 10:26.659
Is that right?

10:26.755 --> 10:29.441
Well, Barbara does have
many admirable qualities--

10:29.537 --> 10:31.359
a wide knowledge
of current events...

10:31.455 --> 10:33.469
and a deep sympathy
for people's inner feelings...

10:33.565 --> 10:37.113
which is a trait so many people have
who are of the Jewish persuasion.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.934
Isn't she somethin' else?

10:40.086 --> 10:41.812
So, yeah, that was it.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.018
I mean, a done deal, finito.

10:45.072 --> 10:46.702
He was a goner.

10:48.142 --> 10:50.251
The point is that, for instance...

10:50.346 --> 10:52.937
Connie Chung,
who is married, I believe...

10:53.033 --> 10:55.142
to Maury Povich,
the well-known interviewer...

10:55.238 --> 10:58.785
doesn't say, 'Hello, this is
Connie Povich with the news.'

10:58.881 --> 11:01.471
I don't think she would be
embarrassed by it...

11:01.567 --> 11:04.635
because she's already pretty ethnic
when you think about it.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.553
Or, to take another example...

11:06.649 --> 11:09.431
someone who doesn't appear to have
an ethnic bone in her body--

11:09.527 --> 11:11.445
Jane Pauley...

11:11.541 --> 11:13.267
who I strongly relate to...

11:13.361 --> 11:16.719
because, you know,
we have similar physical traits.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.500
Although, I thankfully don't have
to struggle with the weight problem...

11:19.500 --> 11:21.034
like she does.

11:22.186 --> 11:24.486
And she also,
to the best of my knowledge...

11:24.582 --> 11:27.460
has never identified herself,
audience-wise...

11:27.556 --> 11:29.283
as Jane Trudeau...

11:29.378 --> 11:31.870
even though her husband,
Mr. Trudeau...

11:31.966 --> 11:34.940
is a prominent cartoonist
of some kind...

11:34.940 --> 11:38.201
and not, as so many people believe,
the ex-president of Canada.

11:38.296 --> 11:40.119
So, what I'm saying is this:

11:41.557 --> 11:45.201
There are some people
who never know who they are...

11:45.297 --> 11:48.365
or who they wanna be
until it's too late...

11:48.461 --> 11:51.625
and that is a real tragedy
in my book...

11:51.721 --> 11:56.613
because I always knew who I was
and who I wanted to be, always.

11:58.626 --> 12:02.462
Who wants to be on TV?
There she is!

12:02.462 --> 12:05.340
- Look at who's looking at herself.
- Just look at that.

12:05.340 --> 12:07.067
Suzanne, lookie there.

12:07.163 --> 12:09.080
Come here.
Look at the camera.

12:09.176 --> 12:11.094
- See?
- Look, what a darling.

12:11.190 --> 12:12.532
Sweetheart.

12:12.628 --> 12:15.408
Can't you get it focused
better than that?

12:16.559 --> 12:18.285
And we're back...

12:18.381 --> 12:20.971
with the families
of Suzanne and Larry Maretto.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.177
Mr. Stone.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.491
At first, I have to admit we--

12:27.587 --> 12:30.369
we didn't think too much of it,
the relationship.

12:31.903 --> 12:35.355
Here was our daughter,
a college graduate.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.754
Junior college, yes, but...

12:37.850 --> 12:40.342
with good grades and a degree in--

12:41.494 --> 12:43.220
Electronic journalism.

12:43.316 --> 12:44.850
Exactly.

12:46.288 --> 12:48.782
And here was this young man...

12:48.878 --> 12:51.466
a good boy obviously...

12:51.562 --> 12:54.153
but, still, a boy
whose education was...

12:55.591 --> 12:57.221
limited to high school.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.577
I remember saying, 'Honey--'

13:00.673 --> 13:03.743
Honey, I'm worried that you don't know
what you're getting into with this kid.

13:03.743 --> 13:06.619
- Dad, I'm not a little girl anymore.
- I know that.

13:07.769 --> 13:09.687
All I'm saying is that...

13:09.783 --> 13:11.701
we come from
pretty different backgrounds.

13:11.798 --> 13:15.154
'For all you know his family
could be mixed up with the mafia.'

13:16.688 --> 13:19.086
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- No problem, Earl.

13:19.182 --> 13:21.004
- I was just being--
- I understand.

13:21.964 --> 13:23.210
I understand. Please.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.196
She just laughed at me.

13:29.538 --> 13:32.320
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry.

13:32.416 --> 13:34.047
That's what dads do.

13:39.897 --> 13:43.443
If you ask me, I'd say Larry
appealed to a side of her...

13:43.539 --> 13:46.609
that you wouldn't ordinarily know
was there.

13:46.705 --> 13:49.774
It was a kind of a-- What?

13:49.870 --> 13:51.403
A wild side.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.062
Not wild, but--

14:01.952 --> 14:03.678
Wild.

14:03.774 --> 14:06.268
I thought he would marry--
I don't know.

14:06.364 --> 14:08.474
A nice lfalian girl.

14:09.913 --> 14:12.501
But like the guy
in The Godfather says...

14:12.597 --> 14:15.283
'This is America, okay?

14:15.379 --> 14:17.585
The melting pot.'

14:17.681 --> 14:21.419
Anyway, one day,
Larry comes over to me. He says--

14:21.515 --> 14:24.681
I'm gonna tell you something, Pop.
She's going places.

14:24.681 --> 14:27.942
She's got goals.
You know, she's studying stuff.

14:28.038 --> 14:30.818
She's sending out resumes
all the time.

14:30.914 --> 14:34.174
Did I show you what she gave me
for my birthday?

14:34.270 --> 14:35.998
'You Can Be The 0ne.'

14:36.094 --> 14:37.628
The one what?

14:37.722 --> 14:40.408
Well, the one anything.
That's the point.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.518
It's self-motivation.

14:42.614 --> 14:45.106
It's from that guy on TV,
the inspirational millionaire...

14:45.202 --> 14:47.025
with all the houses and yachts.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.464
You know?

14:48.559 --> 14:50.190
Sounds pretty serious.

14:50.285 --> 14:53.067
Serious? Pop, I sold my drums.

14:54.793 --> 14:57.094
- You sold your drums?
- Yep.

14:58.629 --> 14:59.395
And he did.
He sold his drums...

14:59.395 --> 15:01.409
And he did.
He sold his drums...

15:01.505 --> 15:03.903
and he turned himself
right around...

15:04.000 --> 15:05.341
just for her.

15:07.644 --> 15:09.177
The veil Suzanne wore...

15:09.274 --> 15:12.438
she had copied
from a picture in a magazine...

15:12.534 --> 15:16.466
the exact same one
Maria Shriver wore at her wedding.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.452
Larry, he was so proud, you know...

15:21.548 --> 15:24.043
'cause Suzanne designed
the wedding rings...

15:24.138 --> 15:25.961
all by herself.

15:26.056 --> 15:28.453
You want me
to describe them for you?

15:28.549 --> 15:31.235
They were round, and gold.

15:32.289 --> 15:34.303
I mean, big fuckin' deal.

15:34.399 --> 15:36.797
Come on, Suze, let's go!

15:36.893 --> 15:39.769
I'll still never find
a guy like you, Dad.

15:42.743 --> 15:43.894
What?

15:50.990 --> 15:54.730
We got a postcard from Suzanne...

15:54.826 --> 15:57.798
every single day
that they were on their honeymoon.

15:57.894 --> 16:01.730
And it very much surprised us
that they went to Florida...

16:01.826 --> 16:06.429
because Suzanne was never one
to lie around the beach.

16:06.429 --> 16:09.787
But Larry was very much
into boatlng and fishing...

16:09.883 --> 16:12.471
and I think she just wanted
to make him happY.

16:12.567 --> 16:15.059
- That's a pretty lady you got there.
- Yes, sir.

16:15.059 --> 16:19.087
We've been married for four days
and 18 hours.

16:19.183 --> 16:21.774
I wouldn't let her
out of my sight for very long.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.746
Well, she can't go in the sun.

16:24.842 --> 16:27.720
It's not good to tan
when you're on TV.

16:27.816 --> 16:30.596
What show is she on?
Have I ever seen her?

16:30.692 --> 16:32.993
Not yet, but you will.

16:47.475 --> 16:49.393
Hi, honey.

16:50.447 --> 16:52.076
Did you miss me?

16:56.489 --> 16:58.406
Did you dream about me, baby?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.134
It must've been a...

17:15.381 --> 17:18.546
pretty successful honeymoon,
because when they came back they were--

17:18.642 --> 17:21.038
- Radiant.
- Exactly. Radiant.

17:22.382 --> 17:25.643
Larry took the money he was saving in
case he wanted to go back to college...

17:25.739 --> 17:28.519
and put a down payment
on that condo at the Heights.

17:28.615 --> 17:31.875
And he bought her
that pretty little Mustang.

17:34.943 --> 17:36.958
- Hi. How are you?
- Come in!

17:37.054 --> 17:38.780
All right. Come on.

17:38.780 --> 17:42.328
So you thought Larry changed a lot
after he and Suzanne were married?

17:42.424 --> 17:45.589
Totally! It was like suddenly
he went from Van Halen...

17:45.685 --> 17:47.986
to Jerry Vale overnight.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.520
She didn't have any--

17:49.616 --> 17:51.439
She thought
she had taste, but--

17:56.617 --> 17:58.632
Barquettes with leek chiffonade.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.701
This is the dish that they serve...

18:01.797 --> 18:04.577
in Johnny Carson's
favorite restaurant in Hollywood.

18:04.673 --> 18:07.932
Well, hey, if it's
good enough for Johnny--

18:13.974 --> 18:16.853
Well, was that
some meal or what?

18:17.906 --> 18:20.689
I say Julia Childs
better watch her back...

18:20.785 --> 18:22.894
or she'll be looking
for another job.

18:24.333 --> 18:27.305
Well, I won't be doing this
every night.

18:27.305 --> 18:31.429
I'm planning on starting this exercise
class so I can get rid of a few pounds.

18:31.525 --> 18:33.538
From where? Your feet?

18:33.634 --> 18:37.182
- On TV the camera adds five pounds.
- Is that true?

18:37.278 --> 18:40.443
I didn't know that.
Did you know that?

18:44.567 --> 18:47.635
Talking about exercise,
I gotta go.

18:48.691 --> 18:50.512
I got a rehearsal...

18:50.608 --> 18:53.582
at some god-awful hour
all the way over in Norwalk.

18:53.582 --> 18:56.747
- What are you rehearsing?
- Janice has a job in the lce Follies.

18:56.842 --> 18:59.144
They're going on tour in September.

18:59.144 --> 19:00.965
- That's fabulous.
- Thanks.

19:01.061 --> 19:04.417
I'm just one of
the chorus now, but--

19:04.513 --> 19:07.391
Actually, I do skate
this one medley.

19:07.487 --> 19:11.707
It's kind of a, you know, salute
to great TV shows.

19:11.803 --> 19:14.488
I skate the Peggy Lipton part
in the Mod Squad number.

19:15.734 --> 19:17.076
Peggy Lipton?

19:17.173 --> 19:19.282
Yeah.
I get to wear a blonde wig.

19:20.721 --> 19:22.063
How exciting.

19:22.159 --> 19:25.898
They're talking about like
maybe a TV special this year or so--

19:25.994 --> 19:27.625
Listen. Hang on, everybody.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.022
Because, well, we've got...

19:30.118 --> 19:32.709
a pretty important announcement
ourselves to make...

19:32.709 --> 19:35.490
and I think congratulations
are in order.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.996
Oh, honey.

19:40.093 --> 19:41.913
Wait, wait, wait!
Cut, cut, cut!

19:42.009 --> 19:43.737
It's not that.

19:43.832 --> 19:47.765
- You're not--
- No, I'm not pregnant, for God's sake.

19:49.202 --> 19:51.887
- Suzy's got a job.
- What?

19:51.887 --> 19:54.861
Over at WWEN, the TV station.

19:54.957 --> 19:57.642
The first woman they ever hired.
Isn't that right?

19:57.739 --> 19:59.367
That's right.

19:59.463 --> 20:02.340
Yep, our Suze is on her way now...

20:02.436 --> 20:05.410
and nothing is gonna stop her.

20:05.506 --> 20:08.095
Oh, honey, I'm proud of you.

20:08.191 --> 20:09.630
That's great.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.752
We're proud of you.

20:13.848 --> 20:15.192
That's great.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.712
- How are the newlyweds?
- They're doing great.

20:21.712 --> 20:24.109
- Thanks, Sal.
- Yeah, cute kids.

20:24.109 --> 20:25.644
- Aren't they just?
- Yeah.

20:25.740 --> 20:28.233
- Did you like the barquettes?
- The what?

20:28.329 --> 20:30.440
With the leek chiffonade.
Was it okay?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.357
We never did 'em before...

20:32.357 --> 20:34.851
but she showed us this recipe
in a book, so--

20:34.946 --> 20:36.576
No problem.

20:36.576 --> 20:38.781
I never told anyone...

20:38.877 --> 20:40.413
even Joe.

20:40.509 --> 20:43.289
So she couldn't cook.
There are worse crimes...

20:44.345 --> 20:46.358
as we all know.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.523
You're not anybody in America
unless you're on TV.

20:49.523 --> 20:52.497
On TV is where we learn
about who we really are...

20:52.593 --> 20:55.085
because what's the point
of doing anything worthwhile...

20:55.182 --> 20:56.714
if nobody's watching?

20:56.810 --> 21:00.167
And if people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

21:01.030 --> 21:04.195
Marry me.
Mary, say yes.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.580
I thought she was like
a goddess of some kind.

21:13.114 --> 21:15.702
Like Lady Di
before she dumped the prince...

21:15.798 --> 21:18.101
and went nudist and everything.

21:18.196 --> 21:21.362
Suzanne bought me this dress,
which I hope to fit someday.

21:25.102 --> 21:27.787
Suzanne Maretto was
a beautiful human being...

21:27.883 --> 21:31.239
with real dreams and aspirations.

21:47.446 --> 21:50.898
Suzanne used to say
'Opportunity is always knocking...

21:50.993 --> 21:53.392
but if you aren't listening,
its knuckles get sore...

21:53.488 --> 21:55.117
and it moves to another house.'

21:55.213 --> 21:57.324
Something like that.

21:57.420 --> 22:00.201
She said that even on her honeymoon
she had Larry take her...

22:00.297 --> 22:03.173
to this hotel in Florida
where there was going to be...

22:03.269 --> 22:06.530
this kind of convention
of all these big-shot TV people...

22:06.530 --> 22:09.311
that she'd read about
in a magazine.

22:09.407 --> 22:11.708
Which, of course,
she didn't tell Larry...

22:11.804 --> 22:14.969
because she didn't want
to maybe hurt his feelings about...

22:14.969 --> 22:18.326
her attending to her career
while they were bonding sexually...

22:18.518 --> 22:20.147
so to speak.

22:22.833 --> 22:26.765
So the German reporter
says to the Hungarian editor...

22:26.861 --> 22:29.162
'Of course she's always smiling.

22:29.258 --> 22:32.326
She gets 'faxed'
at least ten times a day.'

22:32.326 --> 22:33.669
Boom.

22:34.723 --> 22:36.355
Thank you.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.272
I know that's a silly joke...

22:38.368 --> 22:41.342
but it does illustrate
our central thesis today...

22:41.342 --> 22:44.123
which is 'Here and Now in the...

22:44.219 --> 22:46.040
Fast-Moving Computer Age.'

22:46.040 --> 22:47.479
It's the--

22:50.931 --> 22:53.232
In our fast-moving computer age...

22:53.328 --> 22:55.535
it's the medium of television...

22:55.535 --> 22:59.563
that joins together
our global community.

22:59.563 --> 23:01.576
And it is the--

23:04.453 --> 23:08.480
It is the television journalist
who serves as messenger...

23:08.576 --> 23:11.453
bringing the world
into our homes...

23:11.549 --> 23:15.001
and our homes into the world.

23:15.001 --> 23:16.537
Thank you.

23:16.537 --> 23:18.166
Thank you very much.

23:19.989 --> 23:21.618
Thanks a lot.

23:28.523 --> 23:31.017
- The point is, Miss--
- Stone.

23:35.619 --> 23:37.154
That's a good name.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.169
Now, that's a name
you can remember.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.811
The point is, Suzanne...

23:42.909 --> 23:45.977
if you want it bad enough
you'll get it...

23:46.073 --> 23:48.471
but you gotta really want it.

23:48.566 --> 23:53.074
You gotta be able to do things
that ordinary people wouldn't do.

23:54.607 --> 23:57.198
You see what I'm saying?

23:57.294 --> 23:58.635
I think so.

23:59.883 --> 24:01.608
How about another of those?

24:03.047 --> 24:04.868
- I don't know about that.
- Sweetheart?

24:04.964 --> 24:06.979
Give us another all around.

24:11.487 --> 24:13.980
Anyway, when I was at the network...

24:13.980 --> 24:17.912
there was this gal from
some ten-watt station in the Midwest...

24:17.912 --> 24:20.213
where she did the weather.

24:20.213 --> 24:22.227
The weather.

24:22.323 --> 24:25.008
So she comes up to New York...

24:25.104 --> 24:28.748
in her best Donna Karan
dress-for-success knockoff...

24:28.844 --> 24:32.297
blonde hair all done up
in a French twist...

24:32.393 --> 24:36.900
and an audition tape
in her imitation leather briefcase...

24:36.996 --> 24:40.640
along with a letter of introduction
from her station manager.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.461
And it says...

24:42.461 --> 24:45.338
'Please give your
most serious consideration...

24:45.338 --> 24:47.257
to the bearer of this letter--'

24:47.257 --> 24:49.078
Miss So-and-so.

24:49.078 --> 24:52.243
'Who is of moderate intelligence...

24:52.339 --> 24:55.791
who has some experience
in broadcasting...

24:55.887 --> 24:57.614
and, more importantly...

24:57.709 --> 25:00.970
who can suck your cock
until your eyes pop out.'

25:09.410 --> 25:11.327
And you know who that gal is?

25:12.670 --> 25:14.012
Who?

25:21.491 --> 25:23.411
Is that true?

25:23.411 --> 25:24.656
It's true.

25:24.752 --> 25:27.151
And here comes the best part.

25:28.397 --> 25:30.124
- Yes?
- This is the best part.

25:30.220 --> 25:33.768
About ten years ago,
I'm at some TV conference somewhere...

25:33.864 --> 25:35.972
and I run into
that station manager...

25:36.069 --> 25:38.753
and I congratulate him
on his letter-writing skills.

25:38.753 --> 25:43.548
And he doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

25:47.001 --> 25:48.345
Why doesn't he?

25:49.494 --> 25:51.509
Because he didn't write
the letter.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.701
Oh. Who did?

25:59.852 --> 26:02.346
She did.
She wrote it herself.

26:07.045 --> 26:08.866
Oh, I see.

26:08.962 --> 26:10.881
It's good, isn't it?

26:14.811 --> 26:17.785
- I watch your show all the time.
- Everybody does.

26:19.127 --> 26:20.566
So...

26:21.813 --> 26:23.730
what do you think, Suzanne?

26:30.347 --> 26:32.553
What do I think about what?

26:32.650 --> 26:33.991
Well--

26:53.459 --> 26:55.281
Hi, honey.

26:55.376 --> 26:57.008
Where were you?

26:58.349 --> 26:59.884
I couldn't sleep.

27:00.940 --> 27:03.625
When I put out the sign
for a gal Friday...

27:03.625 --> 27:06.022
I figured I'd be interviewing
a couple of high school dropouts...

27:06.118 --> 27:09.284
who wouldn't mind going to the mall
and picking up doughnuts...

27:09.378 --> 27:12.064
and emptying the ashtrays,
that kind of thing.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.365
This is when we
first meet Gangbusters.

27:14.461 --> 27:17.242
That's what George and I
called Suzanne.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.434
Not to her face, of course.

27:38.915 --> 27:43.039
Mr. Grant, I am the woman
you are looking for.

27:43.135 --> 27:44.958
My name is
Suzanne Stone Maretto...

27:45.054 --> 27:48.505
but I plan to use Suzanne Stone
as my professional name.

27:48.601 --> 27:51.286
I'd like you to look over
my resume...

27:51.382 --> 27:53.971
which details
both my educational background...

27:53.971 --> 27:56.656
and my references
in the media field.

27:58.671 --> 28:01.259
I can make you a solemn promise
that I will be...

28:01.355 --> 28:03.369
dedicated and committed
to this job.

28:03.369 --> 28:05.576
Hang on a second.

28:05.671 --> 28:08.644
We're only looking for someone
to answer the mail, run errands.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.753
Minimum pay, no benefits.

28:10.849 --> 28:12.672
Money is not my main concern.

28:12.768 --> 28:15.836
I just want a chance
to contribute something.

28:15.932 --> 28:19.193
I think you'll find I have
very valuable ideas about programming.

28:19.288 --> 28:20.920
Whoa! No!

28:20.920 --> 28:24.181
You're not hearing what I'm saying.
Take a look around you.

28:24.276 --> 28:27.920
I mean, Suzanne, we're talking
local cable station here.

28:27.920 --> 28:30.797
I just want a chance
to get my foot in the door.

28:30.797 --> 28:32.714
Everybody has to start somewhere.

28:32.714 --> 28:35.304
Do you know where
Edward R. Murrow started?

28:36.550 --> 28:38.182
No, I don't.

28:39.332 --> 28:41.250
No. Well, neither do I offhand.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.647
I don't think it was
at the top, do you?

28:44.894 --> 28:46.907
I live only five minutes from here.

28:47.003 --> 28:48.826
I will be willing and eager...

28:48.922 --> 28:52.278
to respond to any newsworthy
emergency you put in front of me.

28:54.771 --> 28:58.223
Mr. Grant, this is a dream
I have had all my life.

28:58.319 --> 29:00.718
I will do anything to get this job.

29:02.251 --> 29:05.415
This is my associate George.

29:08.484 --> 29:10.979
Pleased to meet you, George.

29:11.075 --> 29:13.759
Well, we'll think about it.

29:15.582 --> 29:17.307
I believe that my assets--

29:17.403 --> 29:19.513
I said we'll think about it!

29:19.609 --> 29:21.527
And we will.

29:21.624 --> 29:23.636
Thank you.

29:30.349 --> 29:32.844
I believe that
in our fast-moving computer age...

29:32.844 --> 29:36.488
it is the medium of television that
joins together the global community...

29:36.488 --> 29:39.365
and it is the television journalist
who serves as messenger...

29:39.461 --> 29:43.296
bringing the world into our homes
and our homes into the world.

29:43.392 --> 29:46.557
It has always been my dream
to become such a messenger.

29:46.653 --> 29:48.762
I look to you, gentlemen, now...

29:48.858 --> 29:50.873
to make that dream...

29:50.969 --> 29:52.502
a reality.

30:00.366 --> 30:02.284
Jesus Christ.

30:02.380 --> 30:04.394
Gangbusters.

30:04.490 --> 30:06.503
Fuckin' gangbusters.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.603
- Come on back to bed.
- I gotta go to work.

30:34.603 --> 30:36.232
- Ten minutes.
- I gotta go.

30:36.328 --> 30:38.630
- Five minutes.
- I gotta put my face on.

30:38.726 --> 30:42.657
- Put your face on me. Two minutes.
- Take your hand away.

30:52.536 --> 30:54.069
Come, Walter.

30:55.221 --> 30:58.576
The dog was a cute little thing,
wasn't it?

30:58.673 --> 31:00.494
She was crazy about that dog.

31:00.590 --> 31:01.933
It was darling.

31:17.757 --> 31:19.290
Oh, hello!

31:27.826 --> 31:29.840
She named it Walter...

31:29.936 --> 31:31.278
after Walter--

31:31.375 --> 31:34.826
Is it 'Cronkite'?
The guy who used to be on TV.

31:34.826 --> 31:37.607
I think he was Dan Rather's
uncle or something.

31:37.703 --> 31:41.539
It was like a hair ball puked up
by some demon from hell.

31:43.170 --> 31:44.992
There wasn't much to do.

31:44.992 --> 31:49.211
Most of the time she just sat
over there and worked on her file...

31:49.211 --> 31:51.608
her idea file.

31:51.705 --> 31:53.623
She had so many ideas.

31:55.636 --> 31:59.280
This is the presentation on that idea
with me going to local movie theaters...

31:59.280 --> 32:02.253
talking to the people coming out
to see what they really think.

32:02.349 --> 32:04.652
An actual...

32:04.748 --> 32:07.240
vox populae, if you know the term.

32:09.063 --> 32:11.940
Here's the memo on that children's show
with me as the hostess...

32:11.940 --> 32:13.857
and the live, in-studio animals.

32:13.953 --> 32:16.542
Look it over tonight.
Give me your thoughts in the morning.

32:17.980 --> 32:21.337
A couple of pages outlining that concept
for interviewing everyday citizens...

32:21.433 --> 32:23.640
like mailmen,
school crossing guards...

32:23.736 --> 32:27.763
to inform our citizenry on what kind of
valuable services are available to them.

32:33.709 --> 32:36.298
After a few months,
she wore me down.

32:36.394 --> 32:39.366
I let her do the evening weather report,
which she was fine at.

32:39.462 --> 32:41.765
Although with the preparation
she put into it...

32:41.861 --> 32:43.778
you'd think
she was covering D-Day.

32:43.875 --> 32:43.970
Six, five...

32:43.970 --> 32:45.888
Six, five...

32:46.751 --> 32:48.957
four, three...

32:49.051 --> 32:50.586
two, one.

32:52.505 --> 32:53.847
You're on!

32:55.670 --> 32:59.218
Good evening
from the WWEN Weather Center.

32:59.314 --> 33:00.848
Weather Center?

33:00.943 --> 33:02.767
The heavy system
we were expecting...

33:02.767 --> 33:05.740
moving down from the north
is not going to show up after all...

33:05.836 --> 33:07.848
because the high pressure system...

33:07.943 --> 33:11.012
is going to be moving
up to the north.

33:11.108 --> 33:14.273
The temperature for tonight
will remain unseasonably cool...

33:14.369 --> 33:16.959
with patches of fog in the morning
and probably--

33:17.055 --> 33:19.644
Come on.
Let's have some quiet here.

33:19.740 --> 33:22.329
The winds are at
seven to ten miles per hour.

33:22.329 --> 33:23.865
Sunrise will be at 6:12.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.452
That's about It for your
up-to-the-minute weather report.

33:26.549 --> 33:28.851
This is your
WWEN weather person saying...

33:28.945 --> 33:32.015
I'll be with You again tomorrow evening,
rain or shine.

33:47.742 --> 33:50.715
I never really gave a rat's ass
about the weather...

33:51.866 --> 33:54.455
until I got to know Mrs. Maretto.

33:54.551 --> 33:57.429
Now I take it very seriously.

33:58.483 --> 33:59.827
If it rains...

34:01.552 --> 34:03.949
or there's lightning or thunder...

34:04.045 --> 34:05.963
or if it snows...

34:06.059 --> 34:07.880
I have to jack off.

34:09.608 --> 34:11.621
Oh, right. Sorry.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.791
Today's guest, Mrs. Maretto...

34:57.940 --> 35:02.351
is a representative
of our local television station, WWEN.

35:02.447 --> 35:04.653
- On-air correspondent.
- I'm sorry?

35:04.750 --> 35:07.818
Actually, I'm
an on-air correspondent.

35:07.914 --> 35:09.927
Well, that's fine.

35:10.023 --> 35:13.476
Anyway, Mrs. Maretto has asked
to have a few words with you.

35:13.572 --> 35:17.791
I know that while I'm gone
you will give her your best attention.

35:17.887 --> 35:19.900
Here's my best attention.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.641
Did you say something, Russell?

35:23.737 --> 35:25.463
No, Mr. Finlaysson, I didn't.

35:26.806 --> 35:28.340
I didn't!

35:33.806 --> 35:37.547
Well, first of all,
I would like to thank you all...

35:37.643 --> 35:41.382
for extending me the courtesy
of your time and attention.

35:41.478 --> 35:42.820
I got something to extend.

35:45.123 --> 35:48.288
And I would like to say
that I hope you'll all be as excited...

35:48.384 --> 35:52.027
about the project I'm here
to propose to you as I am.

35:52.123 --> 35:54.137
First of all, I want to ask...

35:54.233 --> 35:57.590
have any of you ever been
on television before?

35:57.686 --> 35:59.699
Not counting home video,
of course.

36:01.137 --> 36:02.672
No one?

36:03.822 --> 36:05.454
I was!

36:08.139 --> 36:10.536
- What's your name?
- Lydia Mertz.

36:10.632 --> 36:14.179
And how did it happen
that you made this appearance?

36:15.331 --> 36:17.728
It was down at Benson's Electronics.

36:17.824 --> 36:20.318
They have this video camera
in the window...

36:20.318 --> 36:23.675
and when you walk by
they take your picture.

36:25.304 --> 36:27.414
Well, this may come
as a surprise...

36:27.510 --> 36:31.251
but that is how some of our
most famous personalities started out--

36:31.347 --> 36:34.224
just seeing what they
look like, accidentally.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.907
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

36:37.963 --> 36:41.416
Now, I am producing
a television documentary...

36:41.512 --> 36:43.525
about kids just like yourselves...

36:43.621 --> 36:45.635
because it is teenagers like you...

36:45.731 --> 36:48.800
who are the future of our nation.

36:48.896 --> 36:51.771
And, after all, I used to be
a teenager myself once...

36:51.869 --> 36:54.074
back in the Dark Ages.

36:56.951 --> 37:00.019
I would like to find out
about your way of life--

37:00.115 --> 37:03.280
how you feel
about your education...

37:03.376 --> 37:06.061
how you feel
about things like peer pressure...

37:06.061 --> 37:07.980
how you feel about drugs...

37:09.610 --> 37:10.952
rap music.

37:11.048 --> 37:12.871
Pussy?

37:14.021 --> 37:17.760
Do we have to get permission slips
from our parents for this?

37:17.856 --> 37:19.775
No, that wouldn't be necessary.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.077
When'd your folks learn
to read and write?

37:22.172 --> 37:23.994
Hey, read this, shitface.

37:26.775 --> 37:28.981
All right.

37:32.146 --> 37:35.119
I am going to put this list
on your bulletin board.

37:35.215 --> 37:38.092
And any of you
who think this project...

37:38.188 --> 37:41.927
would be as meaningful
as I know it can be...

37:42.023 --> 37:43.367
put their names on it.

37:44.326 --> 37:46.914
I would also like to thank you all...

37:48.065 --> 37:49.983
for your interest.

37:57.751 --> 38:00.148
- Everything settled then?
- Yes.

38:01.875 --> 38:05.231
Well, then let's give
Mrs. Maretto our thanks...

38:05.327 --> 38:07.054
and a round of applause.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.315
Thank you.

38:18.465 --> 38:19.903
Sign up.

38:41.864 --> 38:45.030
I'd never really signed up
for anything before...

38:45.030 --> 38:48.481
except an after-school
weight watchers program...

38:48.577 --> 38:52.030
which I was asked to leave anyway
'cause they said I wasn't motivated...

38:52.126 --> 38:55.961
and because I gained 11 pounds
in three weeks.

38:55.961 --> 38:57.496
But this was different...

38:57.592 --> 39:01.045
'cause it turned out to be
the most important thing I ever did.

39:08.141 --> 39:10.922
Now, here's some advice,
Russell dear.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.565
That nice Mrs. Maretto
is married to a boy...

39:14.661 --> 39:17.731
whose father is a pillar
of the ltalian-American community...

39:17.827 --> 39:20.416
and if he knew
how you had insulted...

39:20.512 --> 39:22.813
his only beloved daughter-in-law...

39:22.909 --> 39:24.731
he would make one phone call...

39:24.827 --> 39:27.224
and a man with a big knife would show up
in the middle of the night...

39:27.320 --> 39:29.047
and turn you into a eunuch.

39:30.197 --> 39:33.458
You know what a eunuch is?
Of course you don't.

39:33.554 --> 39:35.472
You can find it in the dictionary.

39:35.472 --> 39:39.213
If you don't know how to spell it, you
can look it up under 'nutless wonders.'

39:40.746 --> 39:44.007
So I'm thinking,
there must be some simple way...

39:44.103 --> 39:46.884
for you to make it up
to Mrs. Maretto...

39:46.884 --> 39:48.802
for your offensive behavior.

39:48.898 --> 39:50.815
What do you think?

39:53.117 --> 39:54.844
What is a eunuch?

40:12.777 --> 40:12.873
I have to say
that the staff at WWEN...

40:12.873 --> 40:15.750
I have to say
that the staff at WWEN...

40:15.846 --> 40:18.818
responded with total enthusiasm
to my project...

40:18.818 --> 40:20.737
and gave me excellent support...

40:20.737 --> 40:22.653
both editorially and technically...

40:22.750 --> 40:25.052
because I think they could sense
almost immediately...

40:25.148 --> 40:27.065
that I was
onto something important...

40:27.161 --> 40:28.983
in a sociological sense.

40:28.983 --> 40:32.340
She must've taped
God-knows-how-many hundreds of hours...

40:32.436 --> 40:34.737
with these three dorky kids...

40:34.737 --> 40:37.614
who, from what I've seen, would have
a major struggle on their hands...

40:37.614 --> 40:40.490
just reciting the days of the week
in proper order.

40:40.490 --> 40:42.313
Forget about social insights.

40:42.313 --> 40:44.135
Here, I'll show you.

40:49.315 --> 40:53.438
This is 'Teens Speak Out' project,
tape one, take one.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.891
I'm Suzanne Stone and these are--

40:59.288 --> 41:03.219
Now, let's just saY something
in general about ourselves.

41:03.315 --> 41:04.657
Like what?

41:04.753 --> 41:06.960
What do you plan to do
with your future?

41:08.782 --> 41:10.987
I don't exactly have a plan.

41:11.083 --> 41:13.768
Well, you must have
aspirations of some kind.

41:13.768 --> 41:15.208
What?

41:15.208 --> 41:17.125
A dream, a life goal.

41:18.563 --> 41:20.960
I can tell you
Lydia's big life goal.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.838
It's to fuck
the new kids on the block.

41:25.181 --> 41:27.099
That's a dirty lie!

41:28.346 --> 41:30.934
I don't want to hear language like that.
It is very offensive...

41:31.030 --> 41:33.811
and it is unsuitable for broadcast
under FCC regulations.

41:33.907 --> 41:35.346
- You got that?
- Yeah.

41:35.440 --> 41:36.976
Anyways, it was Motley Crue.

41:37.072 --> 41:38.414
All right, Lydia.

41:38.510 --> 41:40.811
- Just for your information.
- What about you, James?

41:50.978 --> 41:52.800
I think you get the point.

41:52.896 --> 41:55.579
It's not exactly
Mike Wallace, eat your heart out.'

41:55.677 --> 41:58.936
But I have to say
I've never seen more persistence.

41:59.032 --> 42:01.047
I once said to her--

42:01.143 --> 42:04.594
What about we call it a night?

42:05.938 --> 42:08.815
Just need to get
this reel cleaned up.

42:08.911 --> 42:11.309
An hour, maybe two.
You go ahead. I'll lock up.

42:11.403 --> 42:13.896
Don't you have that nice husband
waiting at home for you?

42:15.048 --> 42:17.541
He knows how much
this means to me.

42:17.541 --> 42:21.186
He works full-time at his dad's
restaurant, so he gets home real late.

42:21.282 --> 42:25.213
Well, Suzanne, I sure pity
the person who says no to you.

42:26.940 --> 42:28.666
No one ever does.

42:33.269 --> 42:35.090
Why're you tyin' her up again?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.639
Why is she fied up again?

42:38.735 --> 42:40.556
Just leave her alone.

42:40.652 --> 42:41.996
Untie yourself.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.914
Leave her alone.
If she runs away--

42:52.257 --> 42:55.038
As Scripture says,
God is alive.

42:55.038 --> 42:56.380
Fucker.

42:56.380 --> 42:58.298
That life, friends, is heaven.

42:58.298 --> 43:00.217
Heaven is waiting for you.

43:07.217 --> 43:10.190
See, nobody ever
called me that before.

43:11.436 --> 43:13.545
All anyone ever called me was...

43:13.545 --> 43:15.655
Jimmy or Jimbo or...

43:15.751 --> 43:17.670
other stuff.

43:17.766 --> 43:20.835
My mom told me
that I was named Jimmy...

43:20.931 --> 43:23.711
after this old movie star
she liked...

43:23.807 --> 43:25.916
named Jimmy Dean.

43:25.916 --> 43:27.452
But...

43:27.547 --> 43:31.478
well, when anyone ever asked me,
I always said I was named Jim...

43:31.574 --> 43:34.739
after Jim Morrison of The Doors...

43:34.739 --> 43:36.465
'cause, you know...

43:36.561 --> 43:38.768
he had this great kind of life...

43:38.864 --> 43:42.125
just traveling around
and writing his songs...

43:42.221 --> 43:44.809
and having women beg him
to do it to them...

43:44.809 --> 43:46.342
even to take his...

43:47.590 --> 43:49.603
'organ' out onstage.

43:52.097 --> 43:54.974
That kind of life
I thought I'd like to have.

44:02.262 --> 44:05.427
I bet he jumps her
all the time, you know?

44:05.523 --> 44:08.208
Like after dinner, just bang,
right on the kitchen table.

44:08.304 --> 44:09.742
Fuckin' during even.

44:09.838 --> 44:12.427
Yeah. Maybe both.

44:14.059 --> 44:16.936
Those skinny bitches,
they can't get enough of it.

44:17.032 --> 44:20.291
They're always wanting it.
That's a medical fact.

44:20.387 --> 44:24.224
It's because the nerves in their body
are all bunched up in their snatch.

44:24.224 --> 44:26.141
They're all right up in there...

44:26.237 --> 44:28.155
so they're all whack.

44:28.155 --> 44:29.882
I don't think that's true.

44:30.936 --> 44:32.471
What are you, a doctor?

44:33.621 --> 44:35.347
She's a perfectly nice person.

44:35.347 --> 44:38.224
You think she's gonna make you
a big movie star?

44:38.320 --> 44:41.581
Just to be on TV
will be something nice.

44:41.677 --> 44:43.594
It'd be something different.

44:43.690 --> 44:46.184
I got something different
for you right here.

44:46.280 --> 44:48.581
You're a disgusting pig.

44:48.677 --> 44:50.021
Yeah.

44:57.501 --> 45:00.858
You know what we should do?
We should get some money out of it.

45:00.954 --> 45:03.447
- What makes you think she's got any?
- You shittin' me?

45:03.541 --> 45:05.556
Her husband, Mr. Fuckin' Big Cock...

45:05.652 --> 45:08.146
owns a fuckin' guinea restaurant,
all right?

45:08.240 --> 45:11.213
Look at the car she drives.
Look at her fuckin' fingernails.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.804
Big, red, sculpted, glossy nails.

45:13.900 --> 45:17.351
She got plenty of money.
That's rich bitch stuff.

45:17.447 --> 45:18.695
Yeah, maybe.

45:18.791 --> 45:21.186
You think she's
some kind of hot shit.

45:23.585 --> 45:26.269
- She just looks--
- What?

45:26.269 --> 45:28.476
Clean.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.407
Come on. They're ready.

45:41.326 --> 45:43.052
Kids, stop it.

45:43.148 --> 45:46.025
- That's a real pretty outfit, honey.
- Thanks.

45:47.175 --> 45:50.054
- You want one of these?
- No, thanks.

45:50.054 --> 45:53.027
What about one of these?
You're goin' in the pool.

45:53.121 --> 45:54.561
No, thanks.

45:57.532 --> 46:00.123
He sure is great with those kids.

46:00.123 --> 46:03.190
He's gotta stop eating that junk.
He's getting a rubber tire around him.

46:03.190 --> 46:05.588
He'll make
a wonderful father someday.

46:05.684 --> 46:08.273
He calls them love handles.
I call them flab.

46:08.369 --> 46:10.960
- What about you?
- Me? You think I look fat?

46:10.960 --> 46:14.028
No! What about the idea of kids?

46:14.123 --> 46:15.657
That's what I mean.

46:15.755 --> 46:19.206
Well, I love kids.
I absolutely love them, but...

46:19.302 --> 46:22.275
a woman in my field with a baby
has two strikes against her.

46:22.371 --> 46:24.289
- Say I'm in New York--
- New York?

46:24.385 --> 46:25.824
Well, for instance.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.509
And I'm suddenly called
on some foreign assignment...

46:28.509 --> 46:30.811
like a royal wedding
or a revolution in South America.

46:30.907 --> 46:33.782
You can't run from place to place
with your crew following...

46:33.880 --> 46:36.661
and conduct serious interviews
with a big, fat stomach.

46:36.757 --> 46:39.920
Or say you've already had the baby,
and you've got this blubber...

46:40.016 --> 46:41.934
these boobs out to here.

46:43.085 --> 46:44.619
It's just so gross.

46:46.826 --> 46:48.168
Careful!

46:49.318 --> 46:52.099
- Excuse me.
- Nice.

46:52.195 --> 46:54.208
You having a good time?

46:54.306 --> 46:56.798
Well, I want to get out of the sun.

46:56.798 --> 46:58.813
I have to go prepare my show.

46:58.909 --> 47:03.128
I sure would like to have
a couple of them. What do you think?

47:04.855 --> 47:06.581
What do you think?

47:06.581 --> 47:09.936
I think if you wanted a baby-sitter
you should've married Mary Poppins.

47:15.978 --> 47:18.280
Hi, Ed. Wake up, George.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.007
Let's hit it.

47:32.858 --> 47:34.295
Hi, everybody.

47:34.295 --> 47:37.364
This is Suzanne Stone with your
late-nlght sign-off weather report...

47:37.460 --> 47:39.762
from the WWEN Weather Center.

47:39.858 --> 47:43.405
I don't think I need to tell you
that today was a hot one.

47:43.501 --> 47:46.378
That old mercury
zoomed on up to 91.

47:46.474 --> 47:48.777
That's a record-breaking temperature
for this day.

47:48.777 --> 47:51.173
Tomorrow promises to be
more of the same...

47:51.173 --> 47:53.186
with relevant numbers
up in the 90's...

47:53.282 --> 47:54.818
humidity to match...

47:54.914 --> 47:57.791
and maybe just a hint
of a breeze or two.

47:57.887 --> 48:00.668
Won't be much help with this heat,
the kind of heat...

48:00.764 --> 48:04.023
that makes me want to head for that
swimming hole with my friend James...

48:04.119 --> 48:06.134
strip off everything,
including my panties...

48:06.134 --> 48:08.148
which you can see
right fhrough anyway...

48:08.148 --> 48:10.545
and poke my soft, pink tongue
in his mouth...

48:10.545 --> 48:12.943
and slide my hand way up
the inside of his leg...

48:12.943 --> 48:15.820
until he's so hot
that he rolls over on top of me...

48:15.820 --> 48:18.601
and I'm yelling, 'James,'
his name.

48:21.958 --> 48:23.780
What are you doing to me...

48:23.876 --> 48:26.945
with your big, fat, hard--

48:30.780 --> 48:32.313
Oh, Jesus.

48:38.452 --> 48:40.081
Listen to me, Larry.

48:42.672 --> 48:45.356
So she finishes
her little docudrama...

48:45.356 --> 48:47.177
whatever the fuck it is.

48:47.177 --> 48:51.206
She sends it off to someone in New York,
and while she's waiting for an answer...

48:51.206 --> 48:53.603
you should, forgive the expression,
knock her up.

48:54.563 --> 48:56.481
Knock her up and then-- Whoa!

48:57.824 --> 49:01.083
Los Angeles? What does Los Angeles
got to do with it?

49:01.179 --> 49:03.481
A course in what?

49:03.481 --> 49:04.918
Advanced media?

49:05.014 --> 49:06.742
Advanced bullshit!

49:06.838 --> 49:09.523
Look, I'm sorry.
You're my brother.

49:10.865 --> 49:14.222
I know you love her
and want her to succeed...

49:14.222 --> 49:17.579
but sometimes, man,
you just gotta say no.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.264
What do you mean, how?
N-O, that's how.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.853
Comes to the right of the key,
throws up a hook shot.

49:22.949 --> 49:24.387
It's good!

49:24.483 --> 49:27.840
The score is again tied
here in the first half at the Palace.

49:27.934 --> 49:29.565
With the ball--

49:33.594 --> 49:35.032
Yeah?

49:38.005 --> 49:40.018
What are you doin'?

49:40.114 --> 49:42.800
Just sitting here,
waiting for you.

49:44.527 --> 49:48.074
I asked you to please keep your feet
off the coffee table.

49:48.074 --> 49:51.719
- We got to talk about some things.
- What kind of things?

49:52.869 --> 49:54.596
I think you know.

49:58.239 --> 49:59.775
No, I don't.

50:00.925 --> 50:04.186
Can't this wait until tomorrow?
I'm really tired.

50:06.007 --> 50:07.925
What?

50:08.021 --> 50:10.514
No, I don't think it can wait.

50:12.721 --> 50:15.981
Sit down.
We're gonna talk about this stuff.

50:17.804 --> 50:21.447
I think we got this great future
ahead of us.

50:21.543 --> 50:24.708
I just want to make sure we both
understand what the priorities are.

50:27.393 --> 50:31.036
I think Pop's gonna let me
take over managing the restaurant.

50:32.284 --> 50:34.969
And I got a lot of exciting ideas...

50:35.065 --> 50:37.750
like introducing
some new menu items...

50:37.750 --> 50:40.148
bringing in live music
on the weekends...

50:40.148 --> 50:42.545
and maybe even one night a week...

50:42.545 --> 50:45.038
open house for
local singers and comics...

50:45.134 --> 50:47.914
which you, with your TV background,
could help me with.

50:48.010 --> 50:50.601
You know,
maybe shooting the acts...

50:50.697 --> 50:52.998
and then maybe selling the tapes...

50:52.998 --> 50:55.780
which you could edit yourself
back to the performers.

50:55.780 --> 51:00.382
I talked to my folks about it,
and they thought it'd be a great idea.

51:00.382 --> 51:01.916
Really.

51:03.643 --> 51:07.478
And, believe me, I am not selling short
what you're doing now.

51:07.574 --> 51:10.835
I mean, the weather report stuff...

51:10.835 --> 51:12.753
which you're really good at.

51:14.096 --> 51:15.534
But let's face facts.

51:15.630 --> 51:17.548
It's probably not gonna...

51:19.273 --> 51:22.630
lead to any big network offers.

51:22.726 --> 51:24.548
Now, this way...

51:24.644 --> 51:27.809
we could be working together
in both our respective fields...

51:27.905 --> 51:31.262
doing what a family
is supposed to be doing.

51:31.358 --> 51:34.043
A family, that's what
I'm talking about.

51:38.166 --> 51:39.795
What do you think?

51:55.427 --> 51:57.057
I'll think about it.

52:04.251 --> 52:07.990
It's true that the road
my husband and I chose to travel on...

52:08.086 --> 52:10.771
was paved with many speed bumps.

52:10.867 --> 52:14.608
Larry said he would never stand
in my way, whatever happened.

52:14.608 --> 52:18.922
But the word failure'
is not part of my vocabulary.

52:19.018 --> 52:22.568
My commitment to my career
or my marriage, or whatever...

52:22.664 --> 52:26.019
has always been 110 percent.

52:26.115 --> 52:28.610
Regardless of how fast I was growing
in my vocation...

52:28.704 --> 52:30.815
I would never leave Larry behind.

52:30.815 --> 52:33.596
The word divorce'
was never mentioned.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.858
What do you think?
Like the color?

52:57.954 --> 53:00.159
- Yeah.
- It doesn't make me look fat?

53:00.255 --> 53:02.077
I think I'm gonna get it.

53:02.173 --> 53:04.666
Mr. Maretto is going to--

53:06.681 --> 53:09.079
Yeah, right.

53:09.079 --> 53:10.900
Let me tell you something.

53:14.065 --> 53:16.271
- No, you wouldn't understand.
- Maybe I would.

53:19.914 --> 53:22.313
Well, you grow up, you know.

53:22.409 --> 53:25.094
You think it's all gonna be
like a fairy tale.

53:25.094 --> 53:29.025
Like you're Sleeping Beauty
and along comes this Prince Charming.

53:29.025 --> 53:31.902
And he looks at you
and it's nighttime.

53:31.998 --> 53:34.778
And he smiles at you
and kisses you.

53:34.778 --> 53:36.697
Yeah, I know that story.

53:37.465 --> 53:38.710
And then...

53:38.806 --> 53:40.342
you wake up...

53:40.438 --> 53:42.835
and it's daylight...

53:42.931 --> 53:44.753
and you look at him.

53:46.384 --> 53:49.068
When you work all day,
trying to perfect yourself...

53:49.164 --> 53:51.657
and create something meaningful,
you expect support.

53:51.753 --> 53:54.054
Does anyone ever say,
'Did you have a good shoot today?'

53:54.150 --> 53:55.972
Or 'How's the editing going?'

53:56.931 --> 53:58.467
I guess not.

54:01.152 --> 54:03.358
I mean, the point is...

54:05.275 --> 54:07.768
Larry is a nice guy, you know...

54:07.864 --> 54:10.644
but he just doesn't know
a thing about television.

54:12.179 --> 54:13.905
Let's get outta here.

54:15.920 --> 54:15.920
Mrs. Maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff...

54:15.920 --> 54:18.701
Mrs. Maretto bought me
lots of nice stuff...

54:18.797 --> 54:21.291
like this ankle bracelet,
for instance...

54:23.400 --> 54:25.893
and a bottle
of real expensive perfume--

54:25.989 --> 54:27.523
a 'scent' she called it--

54:27.523 --> 54:30.304
which I'm saving
for a special occasion.

54:30.304 --> 54:33.661
No one ever really
bought me stuff before...

54:33.661 --> 54:36.730
except my mom's boyfriend Chester...

54:36.826 --> 54:39.128
who got me for my birthday
when I was 12...

54:39.224 --> 54:43.251
a bottle of something called
Garden of Eden body oil...

54:43.347 --> 54:46.416
which he said would be good
for my skin...

54:46.512 --> 54:49.867
and which he wanted
to show me how to use...

54:51.210 --> 54:52.840
which I let him do.

54:52.936 --> 54:55.335
He did other things for a while.

54:55.431 --> 55:00.034
When I was 13, I got this mild case of
T. B. and he wasn't interested anymore.

55:01.664 --> 55:04.445
You just have to block that
out of your memory...

55:04.541 --> 55:07.130
like some scary TV movie
where you just change the channel...

55:07.226 --> 55:09.335
and pretend like it never happened.

55:09.335 --> 55:12.021
Before you know it, the whole thing
will be like a bad dream.

55:13.076 --> 55:16.623
Anyway, my mom keeps this gun
hidden in her closet...

55:16.719 --> 55:19.597
'cause of all
the sex fiend killers around.

55:19.693 --> 55:22.760
And one time, I told him
if he didn't leave me alone...

55:22.856 --> 55:25.637
I'd get it out
and I'd shoot him.

55:28.036 --> 55:31.297
I mean, he didn't give me
any more trouble or anything.

55:32.927 --> 55:36.380
Now I guess I wish
I hadn't told her all that...

55:36.476 --> 55:39.639
'cause maybe it put
some ideas in her mind.

55:39.639 --> 55:41.175
I don't know.

55:41.175 --> 55:45.489
I just told her stuff I'd never told
anyone, because she was my friend.

55:45.585 --> 55:47.695
She was my only real friend.

55:53.737 --> 55:55.367
Where are you going?

55:56.422 --> 55:57.956
I told you, hon.

55:58.052 --> 56:00.545
Pop and I are going
to the trade show in Freeport.

56:00.545 --> 56:03.231
- We're leaving from the restaurant.
- Yeah. Right.

56:03.327 --> 56:05.916
- Look, are you going to be okay?
- Sure.

56:07.451 --> 56:10.231
Will you think about
what we talked about?

56:11.478 --> 56:13.492
I have been.

56:13.588 --> 56:15.697
That's great, hon,
because I believe...

56:15.793 --> 56:18.192
I got something here
that's really gonna work.

56:18.288 --> 56:20.972
You know who I want
with me by my side?

56:22.123 --> 56:25.096
- Who?
- 'Who'? My best girl, that's who!

56:25.192 --> 56:26.822
My beautiful little lady.

56:28.931 --> 56:33.630
I left a phone number on the fridge.
And don't forget to lock the garage.

56:33.726 --> 56:34.974
Bye.

57:18.510 --> 57:20.333
You know what
I'm thinkin', Larry?

57:20.429 --> 57:23.498
Why don't we get some artificial
plants for the restaurant?

57:24.456 --> 57:26.376
Good idea.

57:26.376 --> 57:29.253
- Then we don't have to water them.
- Exactly.

57:37.690 --> 57:39.322
Come on, Liddy.

57:41.047 --> 57:43.157
I can't do this,
Mrs. Maretto.

57:43.157 --> 57:44.788
Of course you can.

57:44.788 --> 57:47.664
You just have to let your
natural sense of rhythm take over.

57:49.679 --> 57:51.501
I don't think I have
one of those.

57:51.597 --> 57:54.376
- She really stinks at this.
- Here.

57:54.472 --> 57:57.063
Watch me.
Watch me.

57:57.063 --> 57:58.981
Watch my hips.

58:00.036 --> 58:01.378
You can do that.

58:01.474 --> 58:03.487
Can't you?

58:04.735 --> 58:07.036
- I can't do that.
- Of course you can!

58:07.036 --> 58:10.681
You just have to move.
Move your body.

58:11.927 --> 58:13.556
Come on.

58:17.777 --> 58:20.271
Come on. Relax.

58:21.134 --> 58:22.956
Relax!
You're like a stick.

58:23.052 --> 58:25.641
- I can't do this.
- Move your hips.

58:25.737 --> 58:30.052
No, I gotta sit down.
This is makin' me feel all funny.

58:33.313 --> 58:35.231
Come on, James.

58:37.820 --> 58:39.449
Come on.

58:52.300 --> 58:53.835
Come on, James.

58:53.931 --> 58:55.177
I'm dancing.

59:02.465 --> 59:04.960
- Would you do me an enormous favor?
- Sure. What?

59:05.056 --> 59:08.219
Walter hasn't been out
for hours.

59:08.315 --> 59:10.713
Would you take him
for a walk around the block?

59:13.782 --> 59:16.371
- Yeah. Sure.
- I'm gonna go upstairs.

59:17.329 --> 59:18.768
Take my sweater off.

59:18.864 --> 59:21.262
It's really hot in here.

59:25.769 --> 59:28.358
When you come back,
I'll fix us something to eat.

59:29.317 --> 59:30.659
And, Liddy?

59:30.659 --> 59:34.496
Don't let him come back until
he's done his business, okay?

59:34.496 --> 59:36.414
Like a good little boy.

59:57.224 --> 59:58.855
I'm back.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:06.525
Hello?

01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:17.746
I have to use the bathroom.

01:01:16.724 --> 01:01:20.271
It was like I was
in one of those--

01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:25.259
Okay, you know those great movies where
everyone is comin' out of their graves?

01:01:25.355 --> 01:01:28.423
With like
half their faces missing...

01:01:28.519 --> 01:01:32.068
and their eyes hanging out
and their lips falling off?

01:01:32.068 --> 01:01:33.507
You know those?

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:37.056
And they're all
walking around...

01:01:37.918 --> 01:01:40.699
real slow like this.

01:01:40.699 --> 01:01:43.864
They're all walking like this
and kind of grunting.

01:01:49.043 --> 01:01:51.248
And they're all looking
for the same thing.

01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:54.509
For regular live people,
to eat their flesh...

01:01:54.605 --> 01:01:56.811
and drink their blood and all.

01:01:56.905 --> 01:01:58.728
Smile. Smile.

01:02:06.304 --> 01:02:08.414
And they can 't
help themselves...

01:02:08.414 --> 01:02:10.811
'cause they're dead...

01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:13.592
and that's just what happens.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:16.085
That's what I felt like.

01:02:17.523 --> 01:02:21.168
You gotta tell me
what's wrong, please.

01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:24.717
James, do you think about me
when we're not together?

01:02:24.717 --> 01:02:27.114
All I do is think about you.

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:32.293
When I'm not with you,
I'm not alive.

01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:34.594
Mrs. Maretto...

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:38.909
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.882
- I can't do this anymore.
- What?

01:02:41.978 --> 01:02:46.101
I can't go home every night
and have him try to touch me.

01:02:46.197 --> 01:02:49.842
And all the time
I'm just thinking about you.

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:52.047
About us.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:56.554
And when I push him away,
he has this temper.

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:57.994
What do you mean?

01:02:58.088 --> 01:03:00.583
Does he hurt you?

01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:04.610
There were these women,
you know...

01:03:04.706 --> 01:03:09.213
on the Sally Jesse Raphael Show
the other day...

01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:12.570
and they were all wearing disguises
so their husbands couldn't find them.

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:16.117
They were living in shelters, and
I thought I could live in one of them.

01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:19.762
If they let me bring Walter with me,
I could live in one of them.

01:03:19.858 --> 01:03:23.503
Someplace in another state
where no one even knows who I am.

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:27.050
Look. Couldn't you
just get a divorce?

01:03:27.146 --> 01:03:30.983
- And then--
- But then he would get the condo.

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:34.914
And he'd get the car.
And he'd take Walter from me!

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.311
He'd take Walter.

01:03:37.407 --> 01:03:41.244
I know you think
I'm just a kid, but...

01:03:41.244 --> 01:03:44.601
I could never do
anything bad to you...

01:03:44.697 --> 01:03:47.862
or ever hurt you.

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:51.313
A guy that does that
to someone like you...

01:03:51.313 --> 01:03:53.614
doesn't deserve to live.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:56.396
That's the truth.
He doesn't deserve to live.

01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:00.327
No. I suppose you're right.

01:04:01.382 --> 01:04:03.204
He doesn't.

01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:08.960
Oh, fuck!
I love this song!

01:04:09.054 --> 01:04:11.547
Don't you love this song?

01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:12.985
I don't know.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.949
Mrs. Maretto used to let me
drive around in her car...

01:04:56.045 --> 01:04:58.635
even though I didn't have
a learner's permit.

01:04:58.731 --> 01:05:02.375
'Cause she said when she'd be living
in California and doing her TV shows...

01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:06.594
she'd make me her personal assistant,
and I'd have to drive her places...

01:05:06.594 --> 01:05:09.663
and help her answer
her personal fan mail.

01:05:11.581 --> 01:05:14.266
I guess this is the
most exciting time of my life.

01:05:14.266 --> 01:05:17.143
It was like living
in a really great movie...

01:05:17.239 --> 01:05:20.884
except it was kind of X-rated on account
of all the sex stuff, you know.

01:05:29.418 --> 01:05:31.239
Hey. Don't stop.

01:05:31.335 --> 01:05:33.733
You didn't answer my question.

01:05:33.733 --> 01:05:35.652
What question was that?

01:05:35.748 --> 01:05:37.762
Did you talk to Russell?

01:05:38.817 --> 01:05:40.255
Yeah, I did.

01:05:40.351 --> 01:05:42.556
What did he say?

01:05:42.556 --> 01:05:44.378
He wants a thousand dollars.

01:05:45.336 --> 01:05:48.597
- Is that all?
- And some CDs.

01:05:53.871 --> 01:05:57.804
- Did you get the gun?
- No, not yet.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.777
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:03.175
I guess I thought
you'd ask Lydia or--

01:06:03.269 --> 01:06:07.106
I can't ask Liddy. You have to.
Don't you understand?

01:06:08.449 --> 01:06:10.846
I guess so,
but I thought--

01:06:10.846 --> 01:06:13.914
Do you want me to keep doing
what I was doing?

01:06:13.914 --> 01:06:16.983
- Yeah, please.
- Okay.

01:06:16.983 --> 01:06:20.436
Then you have to do
what you have to do.

01:06:29.163 --> 01:06:31.753
- So when will it happen?
- Please don't--

01:06:31.847 --> 01:06:35.108
- I just want to know when.
- Let's just do this.

01:06:36.164 --> 01:06:39.329
I don't know.
Whenever. Jesus.

01:06:41.438 --> 01:06:44.027
If you don't know,
I'll have to find somebody who does.

01:06:44.123 --> 01:06:47.672
Aw, Mrs. Maretto,
you have to understand.

01:06:47.768 --> 01:06:50.164
No. I think I do understand.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.425
Obviously you're not the mature
individual that I thought you were.

01:06:58.701 --> 01:07:01.768
Actually,
I just had a thought.

01:07:01.864 --> 01:07:04.836
- Maybe a better way to go on the thing.
- What's that?

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:07.809
- Russell.
- What about him?

01:07:10.304 --> 01:07:13.947
Russell's enough of a man
to take charge of the situation.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.920
- Well--
- He looks at me in a certain way.

01:07:18.358 --> 01:07:21.139
I think he'd be very appreciative
of what I could do for him.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.552
What do you think?

01:07:28.621 --> 01:07:31.594
I think we could
probably do it next week.

01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:33.032
Is that soon enough?

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:36.195
Would you really
do that for me, James?

01:07:36.963 --> 01:07:38.594
Anything.

01:07:40.704 --> 01:07:43.389
And then we can be together.

01:07:43.485 --> 01:07:45.978
And you can sleep over.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.951
And we could do
anything we wanna do.

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:51.445
- Anything?
- Yeah.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.034
Anything.

01:08:05.061 --> 01:08:05.061
Got it?

01:08:05.061 --> 01:08:07.076
Got it?

01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:10.048
Stand back,
tell me if it's straight.

01:08:10.048 --> 01:08:12.350
Oh, it looks great.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:23.984
Hey, Walter!

01:09:32.139 --> 01:09:33.479
Five.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.288
Four.

01:09:43.358 --> 01:09:46.712
Come on, boy.
Let's go for a walk.

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:47.770
Three.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:56.497
Two.

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.702
One.

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:02.921
Hi, everybody.

01:10:03.018 --> 01:10:05.416
- This is Suzanne Stone, live.
- What do you want?

01:10:05.511 --> 01:10:06.949
Don't fuckin' move.

01:10:07.045 --> 01:10:08.962
Just take whatever you want
and get out.

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:10.881
Come on, Jimmy. Now!

01:10:10.976 --> 01:10:12.703
Wait.

01:10:12.703 --> 01:10:13.662
Just wait.

01:10:15.771 --> 01:10:18.073
Take the watch.
It's a Rolex.

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.662
I know it's a fucking Rolex.
Think it's the first time I've seen one?

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:24.404
Gimme your fuckin' chain.
Gimme your chain.

01:10:29.101 --> 01:10:31.979
As you've probably noticed,
it's been another beautiful evening...

01:10:32.074 --> 01:10:33.896
with just a slight chill
in the air...

01:10:33.993 --> 01:10:37.828
and those autumn temperatures
right about where they should be.

01:10:37.828 --> 01:10:39.747
Now, Jim.
Do it.

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:43.007
- No, please.
- Give me your ring.

01:10:43.104 --> 01:10:45.118
- My ring?
- Give it to me.

01:10:45.118 --> 01:10:46.747
I can't give you my ring.

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:48.474
My wife will kill me.

01:10:48.569 --> 01:10:51.447
She'd kill you?
Suzanne would kill you?

01:10:51.542 --> 01:10:52.980
You know my wife?

01:10:55.186 --> 01:10:56.337
Jimmy, now.

01:10:56.337 --> 01:10:58.542
Fuckin' now, asshole!
Do it!

01:11:00.748 --> 01:11:02.283
God, forgive me.

01:11:08.132 --> 01:11:10.529
So, for the next few days
it should be...

01:11:10.626 --> 01:11:12.832
just about perfect
for boat season weather.

01:11:12.832 --> 01:11:15.805
That's about it for tonight.
I'm Suzanne Stone saying--

01:11:28.943 --> 01:11:32.779
And if you'll allow me,
just a personal note.

01:11:32.779 --> 01:11:36.711
A special greeting
to my husband Larry...

01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:39.204
on this, our first anniversary.

01:11:40.163 --> 01:11:41.889
Good night, honey.

01:11:43.903 --> 01:11:44.957
Come on!

01:12:03.179 --> 01:12:04.712
Hello.

01:12:27.729 --> 01:12:28.591
Hello.

01:12:30.702 --> 01:12:32.237
Anything?

01:12:32.332 --> 01:12:34.537
Looks like a little dirt.
Who knows?

01:12:35.592 --> 01:12:38.278
- And this.
- What?

01:12:38.278 --> 01:12:39.811
Don't know.

01:12:41.634 --> 01:12:44.416
Feels like pieces of shell.

01:12:44.511 --> 01:12:47.005
- Janice Maretto?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:48.922
Telephone call at the desk.

01:12:51.895 --> 01:12:53.430
Hello.

01:12:55.635 --> 01:12:57.170
What?

01:13:03.115 --> 01:13:04.649
Thank you.

01:13:12.131 --> 01:13:13.760
Hey, wake up!

01:13:13.855 --> 01:13:15.869
We're open right now!

01:13:15.966 --> 01:13:18.650
All Saturday night around the clock.

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:21.528
Anything upset him
at the restaurant?

01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:24.788
Some guy come in and drink too much,
or say something to him?

01:13:25.844 --> 01:13:29.296
Five-piece, all-wood dinettes
in Colonial, oak and white.

01:13:29.391 --> 01:13:31.118
Your choice, 297.

01:13:31.215 --> 01:13:35.337
Complete king bed set--
mattress, box, frame-- 297.

01:13:35.434 --> 01:13:38.311
- That's Tom Peterson.
- And Gloria Stewart.

01:13:38.405 --> 01:13:42.338
And that concludes
our broadcast day at WWEN.

01:13:42.434 --> 01:13:45.216
Your communitY access station
serving Little Hope...

01:13:45.216 --> 01:13:47.421
and the greater
Hope County area.

01:14:34.698 --> 01:14:37.576
You don't have to talk to those people
if you don't want to.

01:15:24.087 --> 01:15:26.484
That's what surprised me.

01:15:26.581 --> 01:15:29.936
That he didn't put up
much of a fight.

01:15:29.936 --> 01:15:32.814
I mean, for a guy
with such a mean temper.

01:15:34.923 --> 01:15:38.088
When I was standing
in the hall...

01:15:38.185 --> 01:15:40.292
with the gun...

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.595
I was trying to keep
from being too nervous...

01:15:42.690 --> 01:15:45.280
by thinking about
Mrs. Maretto...

01:15:45.376 --> 01:15:48.829
and how we'd be together
for the rest of our lives.

01:15:48.925 --> 01:15:50.555
Let us take leave
of our brother.

01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:54.966
Living in Callfornia,
Florida, somewhere...

01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:59.377
Iying around on beaches
where everyone goes topless...

01:15:59.474 --> 01:16:01.104
and working on her TV show.

01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:04.172
When the love of Christ,
which conquers all things...

01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.762
destroys even death itself.

01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:30.640
All by myself

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:36.970
Don't wanna be
all by myself

01:16:38.024 --> 01:16:40.039
Anymore

01:16:50.684 --> 01:16:52.698
I just knew.

01:16:52.698 --> 01:16:55.957
I don't know why I knew.
I just-- I just knew.

01:16:56.055 --> 01:17:00.561
It was like a light just went off
in my head, and I knew she'd--

01:17:05.644 --> 01:17:08.042
I knew she just got rid of him.

01:17:08.137 --> 01:17:10.247
Just got in her way.

01:17:13.699 --> 01:17:15.426
Anyway--

01:17:18.783 --> 01:17:22.329
Then I didn't see her again.
That was the last time I saw her.

01:17:22.329 --> 01:17:24.056
Suzanne.

01:17:24.152 --> 01:17:25.975
I'm sorry.
Could we--

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:28.180
Could we stop for a second?

01:17:38.059 --> 01:17:40.551
- What do you want, Liddy?
- Just to talk.

01:17:41.413 --> 01:17:44.483
I'm really busy right now.
What do you want to talk about?

01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:47.551
- What we're gonna do!
- We?

01:17:47.648 --> 01:17:49.565
You and me and Jimmy.

01:17:49.565 --> 01:17:52.827
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared about.

01:17:52.922 --> 01:17:56.759
You and I and Jimmy are gonna stay
miles away from each other.

01:17:56.854 --> 01:17:58.195
Well, he's here.

01:17:58.292 --> 01:18:00.881
Here?
Shit! Where?

01:18:00.978 --> 01:18:02.895
Across the street.

01:18:05.292 --> 01:18:07.690
Jesus Christ!
Get in here.

01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:09.416
Get in here quick!

01:18:10.471 --> 01:18:14.212
Now you listen to me.
You tell James to stay away, all right?

01:18:14.212 --> 01:18:17.471
What is the matter with you people?
Don't you ever watch Mystery Theater?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:22.650
He says that he needs to see you
and that he's dying of love.

01:18:22.650 --> 01:18:24.280
Tell him to call a doctor.

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.871
And Russell wants
his money and his CDs.

01:18:26.966 --> 01:18:30.226
Really? You tell Russell
if he doesn't keep his mouth shut...

01:18:30.226 --> 01:18:33.872
he's gonna be playing his
goddamn CDs in the gas chamber!

01:18:33.872 --> 01:18:35.788
What else?
What do you want?

01:18:35.788 --> 01:18:39.817
Just to be like before,
like we were.

01:18:39.912 --> 01:18:42.023
Lydia, we can't be like we were.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:44.899
We have to forget
we ever knew each other.

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:47.969
Go on, get outta here.

01:18:49.694 --> 01:18:52.283
What about the Tv show
in California and everything?

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:54.585
Jesus, Liddy.
Get real.

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:57.078
God!

01:19:04.175 --> 01:19:06.860
- Did you tell her I love her?
- Yes, I did.

01:19:06.957 --> 01:19:09.833
She said you were sick
and you needed to see a doctor.

01:19:20.478 --> 01:19:21.820
Hello, Suzanne.

01:19:24.122 --> 01:19:25.560
How's it goin'?

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.109
I'm real unhappy I haven't been able
to give you an exclusive on everything.

01:19:29.204 --> 01:19:31.985
- Pardon?
- The competing news markets...

01:19:32.082 --> 01:19:35.341
are clamoring for attention, and
I have to consider future possibilities.

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:38.795
- Of course. I understand absolutely.
- Good.

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:40.712
I need to collect my tapes.

01:19:40.712 --> 01:19:43.782
With all the publicity,
I've decided to finish my documentary--

01:19:43.877 --> 01:19:46.466
- There's gonna be a slight problem.
- Problem?

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:49.055
- The cops took 'em.
- What do you mean?

01:19:49.150 --> 01:19:52.412
- They came and took 'em away.
- Why would they do that?

01:19:52.507 --> 01:19:55.770
- They said it was standard procedure.
- But those tapes belong to me!

01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:59.509
Technically speaking,
those tapes actually belong to us.

01:19:59.604 --> 01:20:01.907
I mean, to the station,
until such time--

01:20:02.961 --> 01:20:06.509
I'll show you the section that peaked
the cops' interest, you might say.

01:20:08.234 --> 01:20:11.591
Today we're talking about
sexually transmitted diseases...

01:20:11.591 --> 01:20:13.988
and teenage attitudes
toward them.

01:20:14.085 --> 01:20:17.057
Would anyone like
to start it off?

01:20:17.154 --> 01:20:18.881
Personally, I'm against them.

01:20:21.565 --> 01:20:23.579
Let's see if we can be
more specific.

01:20:23.676 --> 01:20:26.264
What do you think of
when I say the word 'AIDS'?

01:20:26.359 --> 01:20:28.278
- Queers.
- Perversion.

01:20:28.278 --> 01:20:29.622
The Hershey Highway.

01:20:30.676 --> 01:20:32.498
Settle down, children.

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:36.430
What about you, Liddy? Supposing
you were in a sexual relationship?

01:20:36.525 --> 01:20:39.595
Would you expect that person
to wear a condom?

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.225
I don't know.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:46.787
I guess it would depend on, you know,
what kind of person he was.

01:20:46.787 --> 01:20:49.376
Yeah, a blind person.

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:56.952
How about you, James?
Are you personally concerned about AlDS?

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:02.322
Well, in my present situation--

01:21:02.322 --> 01:21:07.310
Well, in the relationship I got goin',
I don't worry about that type of thing.

01:21:08.171 --> 01:21:10.186
She's not that kind of person.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:13.350
She's very clean.

01:21:24.667 --> 01:21:27.256
That's the piece GerAldo used
with some minor editing.

01:21:27.353 --> 01:21:30.421
It was on First Edition
and American Justice.

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:34.353
We made a few bucks on this one,
and got a nice credit.

01:21:34.448 --> 01:21:36.654
...in the Holy Spirit,
I want you to bow down...

01:21:36.751 --> 01:21:38.859
Arms straight up.

01:21:38.956 --> 01:21:41.832
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you for my life.

01:21:41.929 --> 01:21:46.627
Think a llttle bit about Your llfe.
Think about what you can part with.

01:21:46.725 --> 01:21:49.792
A dollar? Ten dollars?
A hundred dollars?

01:21:49.887 --> 01:21:52.573
How important is Jesus
in your life?

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:40.715
As you can imagine...

01:22:41.865 --> 01:22:44.551
I was shocked
beyond comprehension.

01:22:45.988 --> 01:22:49.537
I mean, to think that these
disadvantaged youngsters...

01:22:49.634 --> 01:22:53.085
who I had taken under my wing
and spent my time with...

01:22:53.181 --> 01:22:58.552
and who would only stand to ultimately
benefit from my media savvy...

01:22:58.552 --> 01:23:02.484
to think they might be responsible
for this heinous crime!

01:23:03.635 --> 01:23:06.319
It simply boggles one
with disbelief.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.704
Of course, I realized,
and I hope this doesn't sound callous...

01:23:13.704 --> 01:23:17.252
that the upside to all this,
assuming justice prevailed...

01:23:17.349 --> 01:23:21.184
is that I would have in my documentary
an extremely marketable commodity.

01:23:21.279 --> 01:23:23.868
Something that even PBS
would take an interest in...

01:23:23.965 --> 01:23:27.706
which would mean a smaller audience
but a much larger prestige factor.

01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:30.869
- Want to tell us about it?
- I got nothin' to tell.

01:23:30.869 --> 01:23:34.034
- Your friend Russell told us plenty.
- Like what?

01:23:34.034 --> 01:23:37.199
He said your dick
was bigger than your brain.

01:23:37.295 --> 01:23:39.884
Oh, yeah?
He really said that?

01:23:39.979 --> 01:23:42.569
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:45.447
- Fuckin' amateurs.
- Who?

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:48.515
Listen, as career criminals...

01:23:48.612 --> 01:23:51.296
you guys flunk out
of kindergarten.

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:53.599
Your prints are on the gun.

01:23:53.599 --> 01:23:56.570
Your pal left a trail of clam shells
all over the murder scene.

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:58.967
You boys did everything
but leave a business card.

01:23:59.064 --> 01:24:02.229
There's Larry Maretto's blood
all over those shoes you wore.

01:24:02.324 --> 01:24:04.338
And pieces of Larry's brains.

01:24:07.023 --> 01:24:10.381
He, he, he used to
beat her up all the time.

01:24:10.476 --> 01:24:13.641
- He said he was gonna kill her.
- I'm sure he did.

01:24:13.641 --> 01:24:17.189
We were going
to California 'cause...

01:24:17.189 --> 01:24:20.737
she said I had real potential
in TV 'cause of my voice.

01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:23.422
- Doing what with your voice?
- Sports.

01:24:23.519 --> 01:24:25.819
Like being a sports announcer.

01:24:25.819 --> 01:24:28.025
When did you start bangin' her?

01:24:28.122 --> 01:24:30.903
- It wasn't like that.
- What was it like?

01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:36.847
It was just--

01:24:36.944 --> 01:24:38.670
We were--

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:41.260
You were what?

01:24:41.355 --> 01:24:43.274
In love.

01:24:48.931 --> 01:24:51.041
We were in love.

01:24:52.576 --> 01:24:56.412
How many times? How many times
did you do it, you and Mrs. Maretto?

01:24:59.001 --> 01:25:01.685
I don't know.

01:25:01.685 --> 01:25:03.988
- Lots, I guess.
- Where?

01:25:04.083 --> 01:25:06.961
In her bed?
ln her and her dead husband's bed?

01:25:08.496 --> 01:25:10.604
Yeah, sometimes.

01:25:10.699 --> 01:25:12.331
Where else?

01:25:15.304 --> 01:25:16.742
In her car.

01:25:17.893 --> 01:25:20.002
- In her car.
- Yeah.

01:25:20.962 --> 01:25:22.305
And once at school.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.278
Jesus Christ.
At school, huh?

01:25:25.373 --> 01:25:28.154
Yeah. In the back of the gym.

01:25:29.688 --> 01:25:34.579
And once late at night at the station
where she does her weather reports.

01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:39.949
And twice at the motel
on Piedmont.

01:25:40.046 --> 01:25:42.444
0h, and the back
of Russell's truck.

01:25:43.786 --> 01:25:47.908
And the movie theater
on Hayworth.

01:25:48.005 --> 01:25:50.594
Oh, a couple times
at her parents' house...

01:25:50.594 --> 01:25:53.568
when they were away
on some vacation or something.

01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:56.060
And...

01:25:57.690 --> 01:26:01.336
also in the field
behind the gas station.

01:26:04.212 --> 01:26:07.664
Probably where you get
your doughnuts and coffee.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.966
It's close.

01:26:29.337 --> 01:26:30.967
Hi, Liddy.

01:26:32.118 --> 01:26:35.091
Is it my imagination,
or is that diet working?

01:26:35.188 --> 01:26:37.489
You lost a few pounds in there?

01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:42.956
I don't know. I haven't
been eating much lately.

01:26:43.051 --> 01:26:45.927
What's this about
talking to the police?

01:26:46.024 --> 01:26:50.148
I just figured that Russell
would tell them everything, so--

01:26:50.243 --> 01:26:53.216
Look. No one's gonna believe
anything Russell or Jimmy say.

01:26:53.313 --> 01:26:55.519
TheY're just a couple of punks.

01:26:55.519 --> 01:26:58.492
They wouldn't be in this deep shit
if theY'd kept their mouths shut.

01:26:58.587 --> 01:27:02.230
There's no evidence that we're involved.
I wasn't near the house.

01:27:02.328 --> 01:27:06.738
And if they did find out anything,
you know who'd be in trouble, don't you?

01:27:06.833 --> 01:27:08.752
- You would!
- What do you mean?

01:27:08.752 --> 01:27:12.109
If you hadn't gotten your mother's gun,
Larry would still be alive.

01:27:12.204 --> 01:27:16.615
- But you asked me to.
- No, I didn't.

01:27:16.712 --> 01:27:20.260
No. Jimmy did.
Don't you remember that?

01:27:20.355 --> 01:27:23.712
But you asked Jimmy,
and you told Russell that you'd pay.

01:27:23.809 --> 01:27:25.822
I don't think so.

01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:27.836
Now you listen to me.

01:27:27.931 --> 01:27:31.385
I never gave Russell any money.
Do you understand?

01:27:31.385 --> 01:27:34.548
The way I remember, it was your plan
all along. You and Jimmy!

01:27:34.548 --> 01:27:38.097
You had a fixation about me, and you
were getting a perverted kick out it...

01:27:38.193 --> 01:27:41.358
like people with your
sexual problems tend to do.

01:27:41.358 --> 01:27:45.291
Russell went along with you because
Russell is an evil fucking scumbag!

01:27:45.386 --> 01:27:47.878
Who, I'll bet, you were having
some kind of dirty sex with...

01:27:47.975 --> 01:27:49.988
in spite of your
lesbian tendencies.

01:27:50.085 --> 01:27:52.291
- Wait a minute!
- Wait for what?

01:27:52.386 --> 01:27:54.975
I thought we were friends.

01:27:59.291 --> 01:28:00.729
Okay, then.

01:28:02.551 --> 01:28:04.853
Can you take some advice
from a friend?

01:28:04.853 --> 01:28:07.443
You keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

01:28:08.592 --> 01:28:11.470
It's their word against mine.
Who are they?

01:28:11.565 --> 01:28:14.251
A bunch of 16-year-old losers
who grew up in trailers...

01:28:14.347 --> 01:28:17.895
whose parents sit around drinking
and screwing their cousins.

01:28:19.143 --> 01:28:21.922
I'm a professional person,
for Christ's sake.

01:28:21.922 --> 01:28:24.320
I come from a good home.

01:28:24.417 --> 01:28:26.717
Who do you think
a jury would believe?

01:28:35.923 --> 01:28:38.993
Thank God we still have
legal procedures in this country.

01:28:39.088 --> 01:28:42.158
The court has ruled this is
a clear case of police entrapment.

01:28:42.253 --> 01:28:45.706
The tapes were found to be
inadmissible evidence.

01:28:49.637 --> 01:28:54.337
My client was granted bail in the amount
of $200,000, which we felt was steep...

01:28:54.432 --> 01:28:58.078
but at least she'll be able to assist us
in the preparation of her defense.

01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:06.037
Do you have a statement?
You have something you'd like to say?

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:10.064
- Suzanne, please say something.
- I just want to say...

01:29:12.461 --> 01:29:14.475
it's nice to live
in a country...

01:29:14.475 --> 01:29:17.640
where life, liberty...

01:29:18.886 --> 01:29:21.956
and all the rest of it
still stand for something.

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:23.873
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna do now?

01:29:23.873 --> 01:29:27.613
I'm gonna go home
and walk my dog.

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:31.259
- How will you address the questions?
- Will you take the stand?

01:29:31.354 --> 01:29:33.560
Did you get those kids
to kill your husband?

01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:36.819
I loved Larry Maretto...

01:29:37.875 --> 01:29:40.463
with all my heart.

01:29:41.231 --> 01:29:43.149
But the fact is...

01:29:45.643 --> 01:29:49.287
my husband had
a serious cocaine problem.

01:29:50.533 --> 01:29:51.972
There.

01:29:51.972 --> 01:29:55.136
I've said it.
I've finally said it.

01:29:55.136 --> 01:29:57.917
I believe that while
I was making my documentary...

01:29:57.917 --> 01:30:00.795
'Teens Speak Out'...

01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:05.110
James and Russell became acquainted
with my husband without me knowing...

01:30:05.207 --> 01:30:07.604
and got him addicted to drugs...

01:30:07.699 --> 01:30:10.194
and became his main supplier.

01:30:10.289 --> 01:30:15.180
And when he tried to break free of them
or maybe when he told them...

01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.056
he was thinking of turning them in
to the law...

01:30:20.934 --> 01:30:22.277
they killed him.

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:26.783
I had no intention
of revealing thls dark side...

01:30:26.783 --> 01:30:29.756
of my late husband's character...

01:30:29.756 --> 01:30:33.399
because I wanted to spare
his parents the pain.

01:30:34.551 --> 01:30:37.140
But I just don 't have
a choice any more.

01:30:37.237 --> 01:30:39.537
I have to defend myself
with the truth.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.662
There were times when--

01:30:56.608 --> 01:31:01.212
And I know someday
when my fight is over...

01:31:01.306 --> 01:31:03.993
I will be joining my husband...

01:31:04.088 --> 01:31:08.212
in the heaven that
he so fervently believed in.

01:31:08.306 --> 01:31:10.033
And that was the last time we--

01:31:10.033 --> 01:31:13.485
- The last time we saw her.
- And that--

01:31:13.582 --> 01:31:16.650
That pretty well
brings us up to date.

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:20.390
Until your phone call, which I
must say wasn't entirely unexpected...

01:31:20.487 --> 01:31:24.131
since in the last few days a number
of interesting offers for my story...

01:31:24.228 --> 01:31:26.431
have been literally pouring in
from the networks...

01:31:26.528 --> 01:31:28.637
and some major movie studios.

01:31:29.693 --> 01:31:33.145
I totally understand why we'll be
keeping this meeting confidential...

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.269
until such time as we may come
to a mutually beneficial agreement.

01:31:37.364 --> 01:31:39.283
And I have to admit...

01:31:40.146 --> 01:31:42.256
that I really do enjoy...

01:31:42.351 --> 01:31:46.762
this spy story aspect of our first
rendezvous, if I may call it that.

01:31:46.859 --> 01:31:49.351
Because I think that being
a good investigative reporter...

01:31:49.448 --> 01:31:52.805
is very much like being
a kind of secret agent.

01:31:53.859 --> 01:31:55.681
I hope you enjoy
viewing this document...

01:31:55.778 --> 01:31:58.176
which I believe could serve
as the first draft...

01:31:58.176 --> 01:32:02.108
that you Hollywood people
are so richly rewarded for.

01:32:02.203 --> 01:32:05.654
Well, I guess that's a wrap.

01:32:25.314 --> 01:32:27.136
Come on, Walter.

01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.057
- Suzanne?
- Yes.

01:32:57.153 --> 01:32:59.742
Finally.
The famous Suzanne Maretto.

01:33:00.701 --> 01:33:02.426
How nice to meet you.

01:33:05.207 --> 01:33:07.127
Did you come all the way
from Hollywood?

01:33:07.221 --> 01:33:09.716
I came a long distance
to see you.

01:33:10.867 --> 01:33:12.400
Who's this?

01:33:14.319 --> 01:33:15.757
This is Walter.

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:17.962
Walter.
Hi, Walter.

01:33:20.936 --> 01:33:23.908
I don't know why,
but I thought that you'd be older...

01:33:23.908 --> 01:33:27.168
running a big studio
and everything.

01:33:27.265 --> 01:33:28.608
I am older.

01:33:31.292 --> 01:33:34.457
Come on out.
I want to show you something.

01:33:37.622 --> 01:33:39.731
I brought my tape.

01:33:39.731 --> 01:33:42.320
Let's go.
Let's go for a walk.

01:33:47.884 --> 01:33:51.336
Oh, dear.
Where are we going?

01:33:51.431 --> 01:33:53.350
To show you.

01:33:53.444 --> 01:33:54.884
What?

01:33:57.953 --> 01:34:01.597
It has to do with your story.
It is so funny.

01:34:01.693 --> 01:34:03.994
I don't see why we have to go.

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:34.297
- This is for you.
- Thank you very much.

01:34:34.395 --> 01:34:36.408
It sure looks good.
Thanks, Mrs. Maretto.

01:34:38.613 --> 01:34:40.435
Maretto's.

01:34:49.257 --> 01:34:51.081
I understand.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.054
Thank you.

01:35:26.659 --> 01:35:28.289
I'll be here...

01:35:28.386 --> 01:35:30.110
every day for life.

01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.207
Plus thirty years,
if I live that long.

01:35:30.207 --> 01:35:34.234
Plus thirty years,
if I live that long.

01:35:38.359 --> 01:35:42.386
Russell copped a plea
and got only 16 years.

01:35:42.483 --> 01:35:44.497
I miss him.

01:35:44.497 --> 01:35:46.511
He was my friend.

01:35:46.511 --> 01:35:48.429
And Lydia too.
She was okay.

01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:51.594
Mostly Mrs. Maretto.

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:55.429
And the weird thing is...

01:35:55.524 --> 01:36:00.224
now it's hard for me to even
remember what she looked like.

01:36:00.319 --> 01:36:01.662
You know?

01:36:02.717 --> 01:36:05.595
Except when I dream about her...

01:36:05.689 --> 01:36:07.512
which I do every night.

01:36:09.143 --> 01:36:12.019
I dream I'm at
a baseball game...

01:36:12.114 --> 01:36:15.855
and I'm way up
in the broadcasting booth.

01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:18.157
And I'm callin' all the plays.

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:22.855
And she's sittin'
right next to me...

01:36:22.952 --> 01:36:26.404
with her hand on my leg,
feelin' me up.

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:32.637
I can hardly wait
to get to sleep at night.

01:36:32.734 --> 01:36:36.282
Suzanne used to say that you're
not really anybody in America...

01:36:36.377 --> 01:36:38.680
unless you're on Tv.

01:36:38.775 --> 01:36:41.269
'Cause what's the point
of doing anything worth while...

01:36:41.269 --> 01:36:44.818
if there's nobody watching?

01:36:44.912 --> 01:36:49.515
So when people are watching,
it makes you a better person.

01:36:49.612 --> 01:36:52.967
So if everybody was on TV
all the time...

01:36:52.967 --> 01:36:55.654
everybody would be
better people.

01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:59.010
But if everybody was on TV
all the time...

01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:01.502
there wouldn't be
anybody left to watch.

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.421
That's where I get confused.

01:37:03.518 --> 01:37:06.489
Anyhow, they're flying me
to go on Oprah next weekend.

01:37:06.586 --> 01:37:09.175
I hope she's gonna give me
some diet tips.

01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:11.765
And Phil Donahue called too.

01:37:11.765 --> 01:37:14.162
But to tell you the truth,
I'm kinda nervous about that one...

01:37:14.257 --> 01:37:17.519
'cause I honestly can't follow
what he's sayin' most of the time.

01:37:17.614 --> 01:37:21.354
There's some others too
that I can't remember off hand.

01:37:22.313 --> 01:37:24.135
But it's really something
when you think that...

01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:26.149
I'm the one
who's gonna be famous.

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:29.217
Suzanne would die if she knew.

01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:34.012
End sticks.
