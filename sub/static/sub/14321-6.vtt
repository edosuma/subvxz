00:01.250 --> 00:02.458
[theme music playing]

01:10.583 --> 01:15.458
[cosmonaut 1] Yes, yes, I know.
Do not take so long.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.333
[cosmonaut 2] Americans.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.708
Disarming warheads
is not digging potatoes.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.750
[speaking Russian]

01:22.750 --> 01:26.166
[screaming]

01:44.583 --> 01:47.125
[delegates chattering]

01:47.125 --> 01:50.208
[US delegate]
Five armed satellites disappear
in a two-month period.

01:50.208 --> 01:52.083
And now the shuttle!

01:52.083 --> 01:54.750
And you tell me your people
know nothing about it!

01:54.750 --> 01:57.250
What about our missing
aerospace scientists?

01:57.250 --> 01:59.458
I suppose we took them also!

01:59.458 --> 02:03.708
Your stolen scientists
were all mutants,
know what I mean?

02:03.708 --> 02:07.000
Perhaps you sold them
into Genoshan slavery?

02:07.000 --> 02:10.166
The Republic of Free Genosha
objects strenuously

02:10.166 --> 02:12.083
to the use of the term
"slavery!"

02:12.458 --> 02:17.125
Mutant powers are a resource
to be managed like any other.

02:17.500 --> 02:21.125
[Magneto] The mutant race
will no longer be managed,

02:21.125 --> 02:23.458
Mr. Delegate.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.333
[screaming]

02:30.500 --> 02:34.250
You will all remain seated
until I have finished.

02:38.708 --> 02:43.750
Ladies, gentlemen,
you have been chosen

02:43.750 --> 02:47.416
to witness the announcement
of a momentous event

02:47.416 --> 02:50.250
in the history of our planet.

02:50.250 --> 02:53.875
The liberation of mutantkind

02:53.875 --> 02:56.375
has begun.

02:58.583 --> 03:03.708
Too long have we suffered
under the oppression
of humankind.

03:03.708 --> 03:07.625
I have witnessed firsthand
the barbarous
treatment of mutants

03:07.625 --> 03:10.250
on your wretched little island.

03:10.250 --> 03:13.708
I will not allow
this madness to continue!

03:15.458 --> 03:17.000
Mutant lover!

03:17.000 --> 03:19.333
[Magneto] We have seen
communities torn apart

03:19.333 --> 03:22.208
by the jealous hatred
of our mutant gifts.

03:22.208 --> 03:24.000
They're evil! All of them!

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
[Magneto]
Roving mobs of vigilantes...

03:26.000 --> 03:28.250
Bring out the muties
or we'll burn them out!

03:28.250 --> 03:30.166
[Magneto]
...seek out the infirm
among us.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.000
I'm just an ordinary mutant.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.833
[Magneto] Some mutants
conceal their true power,

03:34.833 --> 03:39.416
living a charade of normality,
while their spirit suffocates.

03:39.416 --> 03:42.291
Others have gone into hiding
beneath your cities,

03:42.291 --> 03:44.708
huddling in the darkness
like rats.

03:44.708 --> 03:47.208
There are those
who have tried nobly

03:47.208 --> 03:49.291
to enlighten
their human brethren,

03:49.291 --> 03:52.958
to strive for freedom
and equality for all men.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.958
Perhaps you self-appointed
social engineers don't realize

03:55.958 --> 03:59.125
the crucial role mutation plays
in species evolution.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.500
Get him!

04:00.500 --> 04:02.291
[Magneto]
Their efforts have been repaid

04:02.291 --> 04:04.958
with brutality and hatred.

04:04.958 --> 04:10.250
The missing mutant scientists
and I have built
a mutants-only asteroid.

04:10.250 --> 04:15.291
Where any mutant
may live apart from humanity,
free from its cruelty.

04:15.291 --> 04:19.250
The first exodus will begin
in 24 hours near Genosha.

04:19.250 --> 04:22.625
Thereafter, mutants who wish
to join us shall gather

04:22.625 --> 04:27.125
at designated pick-up points,
once the first pilgrims
are settled.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.875
My mission is peaceful.

04:29.875 --> 04:33.583
Any intervention
would make it otherwise.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.958
The decision is yours.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.375
Oh, Magnus,
we have been through so much.

04:41.708 --> 04:45.833
Can my failure be so complete?

04:45.833 --> 04:47.333
[mutants]
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.958
[mutants]
There must be more seats!

04:48.958 --> 04:51.125
[mutant] I'll pay $2,000!

04:51.583 --> 04:54.083
[man]
So long, you rotten muties!

04:54.333 --> 04:55.458
[woman] Get out of here!

05:06.166 --> 05:09.291
Byron Calley,
running off with Magneto.

05:11.125 --> 05:12.833
What you think
they doing up there?

05:12.833 --> 05:15.958
Much as I am doing right now,
I suppose.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.708
Magneto had access
to the advanced technology

05:18.708 --> 05:20.458
he found in the Savage Land.

05:20.458 --> 05:24.125
No doubt they're adapting it
to their own uses,

05:24.125 --> 05:27.875
as we are adapting
the Shi'ar devices
to achieve Earth orbit.

05:27.875 --> 05:29.458
But what for?

05:29.458 --> 05:32.875
These mutants are scientists,
not soldiers.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.125
Why they join up with Magneto?

05:35.125 --> 05:39.458
I reckon they got tired
of getting beat up
and treated like dirt.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.250
Still no reason
to pack up and leave.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.708
I don't know, chere.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.208
We stay here fighting
all the time,

05:45.208 --> 05:46.833
things don't get much better.

05:46.833 --> 05:49.500
Gambit's point
has a certain validity.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.833
Despite our most
earnest efforts, we seem
to spend more time

05:52.833 --> 05:55.458
fighting for our lives
than for mutant rights.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.000
You thinking about
moseying skyward?

05:58.000 --> 06:03.083
Just thinking out loud, chere.
You know Gambit
follow you anywhere.

06:03.958 --> 06:07.875
Mr. President,
any hostile action now
against Magneto

06:07.875 --> 06:10.208
could start
a nuclear holocaust.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.708
Don't you think I know that?

06:11.708 --> 06:13.166
But people are scared
and angry,

06:13.166 --> 06:14.458
and they expect me to act.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.625
Professor, Magneto's
got missiles up there.

06:17.625 --> 06:20.833
He says they're defensive.
But how can I take that chance?

06:20.833 --> 06:23.583
I know Magneto.
He won't lie to me.

06:23.875 --> 06:28.750
If I can speak with him,
I'm certain we'll find
a peaceful solution.

06:28.750 --> 06:32.375
All right, we'll play it
your way for now.
I won't call in the military.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.708
You've got 12 hours.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.875
I shall call the rest
of the team together.

06:36.875 --> 06:41.000
That won't be necessary.
You and I will go alone.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.708
The full team
would provoke him.

06:42.708 --> 06:44.708
This is a peace mission,
not combat.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.458
We'll have to go to Africa
and meet him face to face.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.708
I'd like to go with you
to see Magneto.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.875
I want to go up
to the asteroid.
I need to see somebody

06:55.875 --> 06:58.416
-already up there.
-What's going on, swamp boy?

06:58.416 --> 07:00.875
Don't worry, chere.
Gambit's got no bags packed.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.166
You're coming back, Cajun?

07:04.166 --> 07:05.458
Promise, chere.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.583
[birds chirping]

07:20.833 --> 07:23.291
[Gambit] I never seen
so many mutants.

07:23.291 --> 07:26.500
How he gonna get
all these folks up there?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.958
Look! I see something!

07:28.958 --> 07:30.458
Fascinating.

07:33.416 --> 07:37.708
Magneto has come for us,
just like he promised.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.083
Come, my children.

07:46.708 --> 07:48.833
Soon you will be free.

07:48.833 --> 07:53.000
Enter the transport
and I shall take you
to your salvation.

07:54.166 --> 07:57.000
Charles Xavier.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.375
I assume you have come
to dissuade me.

08:00.375 --> 08:04.125
I simply wish you
to consider the consequences
of your actions.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.833
Your separate mutant nation
will solve nothing.

08:07.833 --> 08:10.000
The world distrusts
your motives.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.416
Every government on Earth
is on full military alert.

08:13.416 --> 08:16.083
The irrational anxieties
of the human governments

08:16.083 --> 08:18.708
are not my concern, Charles.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.000
Now, I have an appointment
on Genosha.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.958
An example, I believe,
of humans and mutants
working together.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.291
Care to join me?

08:28.291 --> 08:32.083
All mutants are welcome
on Asteroid M.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.833
Even X-Men.

08:33.833 --> 08:37.458
Very well, Magnus.
It'll give us a chance to talk.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.750
How odd.
He appears to be weakening.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.583
[groaning]

09:27.875 --> 09:30.500
Hear me, mutants of Genosha!

09:30.500 --> 09:35.500
You will suffer no longer
under the yoke
of your human masters.

09:35.500 --> 09:41.000
Cast off your bonds and join me
in your new homeland.

09:45.333 --> 09:46.708
[Magneto] Do not provoke me.

09:46.708 --> 09:48.875
I do not wish to harm you,

09:48.875 --> 09:51.166
but I shall
to protect my people.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.833
[Anderson]The mutant citizens
of Free Genosha

09:53.833 --> 09:56.333
will not be going anywhere!

09:56.333 --> 09:59.958
By order
of the sovereign government
of Free Genosha,

09:59.958 --> 10:02.625
I place you under arrest!

10:14.416 --> 10:16.375
[Cortez] Lord Magneto has come!

10:17.083 --> 10:20.000
We will be held down no longer!

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Destroy the human oppressors!

10:28.125 --> 10:30.958
[Beast] It appears
a local resistance group
has been emboldened

10:30.958 --> 10:34.000
to aid Magneto
through this confrontation.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.708
[Cortez]
Destroy the human oppressors!

11:02.833 --> 11:05.375
Long live Magneto!

11:05.375 --> 11:07.416
We are free!

11:15.208 --> 11:18.166
Now! We need them now!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.583
Surrender, mutants.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
[groaning]

12:04.333 --> 12:05.458
[Gambit] Over here!

12:06.416 --> 12:09.125
Rock solid chrome...

12:10.500 --> 12:12.750
coming down!

12:22.708 --> 12:24.583
[sentinel 1]
Primary target acquired.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.000
[sentinels]
Neutralization imminent.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.166
Lord Magneto!

12:38.583 --> 12:41.500
Lord Magneto,
I am Fabian Cortez.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
My mutant power will heal you.

12:45.708 --> 12:46.750
Fascinating.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.583
[soldiers screaming]

13:03.000 --> 13:05.375
[Cortez]
You are rejuvenated, my lord.

13:05.375 --> 13:10.458
Now you may destroy
the flat-scan human tyrants
once and for all!

13:10.458 --> 13:15.166
I come to rescue my people,
not to avenge them.

13:23.500 --> 13:26.875
Gather your troops.
We are all going home!

13:52.125 --> 13:54.958
Remy, long time!
When did you sign up?

13:54.958 --> 13:57.250
Just having
a look around, Byron.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.333
[Cortez] The journey
has fatigued you, my lord.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.750
Let my power heal you again.

14:11.708 --> 14:14.166
[Beast] He does not appear
to be healing Magneto,

14:14.166 --> 14:16.000
so much as recharging him.

14:16.333 --> 14:20.375
[Xavier] Yes, I fear
Magneto may come
to depend upon it like a drug.

14:20.958 --> 14:22.875
Magnus, we must speak.

14:22.875 --> 14:26.583
You are dangerously
overexerting your powers.

14:26.583 --> 14:31.083
And you fear for my life?
How thoughtful.

14:32.875 --> 14:38.125
Please, join us for dinner.
We have a world to create!

14:41.875 --> 14:44.708
-I don't believe it!
-Amelia?

14:44.708 --> 14:46.875
We have nothing to say
to each other.

14:46.875 --> 14:48.708
-Amelia, please.
-Nothing.

14:49.875 --> 14:51.958
Of all mutants on Earth,

14:51.958 --> 14:55.166
I certainly did not expect
to see her here.

14:56.458 --> 15:00.375
Lord Magneto,
my followers and I
pledge our allegiance

15:00.375 --> 15:02.166
to your righteous cause.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.750
We shall be
your loyal servants.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.375
I thank you for your devotion.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.750
Now get off your knees.
I need hard work,
not adulation.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.208
[footsteps approaching]

15:13.208 --> 15:15.583
-Sir?
-[Magneto] Yes, Mr. Calley?

15:15.583 --> 15:18.458
Sir, the repairs
to the NASA shuttle
are nearly complete.

15:18.458 --> 15:21.708
The astronauts
will be ready to depart
within 12 hours.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.708
Excellent, keep me informed.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.000
There are humans here?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.625
They are my guests.

15:28.625 --> 15:32.208
Yes, of course, my lord.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.583
[Magneto]
Kinsmen and honored guests.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.875
Welcome to your new home.

15:37.875 --> 15:42.583
I propose a toast. To freedom!

15:42.583 --> 15:44.166
[all] Freedom!

15:48.708 --> 15:50.583
[Magneto]
As a great man once said,

15:50.583 --> 15:53.458
"The price of freedom
is eternal vigilance."

15:53.458 --> 15:55.625
We are under attack.

15:56.083 --> 15:59.958
[Calley]
Several armed satellites are
closing on our position, sir.

16:01.583 --> 16:06.583
[Magneto]
I asked for so little.
Just to be left alone!

16:09.708 --> 16:13.333
Counterattack, my lord!
Punish them
for their aggression!

16:13.333 --> 16:14.875
No, Cortez.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.500
Then make an example
out of the astronauts.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.708
Non-mutant humans
perceive this colony
as a threat.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.958
They are acting out of fear.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.708
Or, sir, they are acting
out of self defense.

16:26.708 --> 16:29.583
One of our own missiles
was launched
prior to the attack!

16:29.583 --> 16:33.458
What? I gave no such order!

16:33.458 --> 16:36.291
The flat-scan humans
will not rest

16:36.291 --> 16:39.458
until every mutant
has been destroyed.

16:39.458 --> 16:43.333
-They must be taught a lesson.
-That is enough, Cortez!

16:43.333 --> 16:46.708
Mr. Calley, cloak the asteroid
and move it to a new orbit.

16:47.750 --> 16:50.583
Send our regrets and an offer
of immediate restitution

16:50.583 --> 16:51.625
to President Kelly.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.083
Advise him there will be

16:53.083 --> 16:55.500
no further aggression
on our part.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.125
Starting to get interesting
up here.

16:58.125 --> 17:01.000
What's with the Professor
and that redhead?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.166
Gambit get the feeling
they got a history.

17:03.166 --> 17:07.375
Very observant.
Her name is Amelia Voght.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.458
They met in a hospital
in India.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.083
Xavier was bitter
and frustrated.

17:12.083 --> 17:15.625
The Professor had just lost
the use of his legs
battling Magneto,

17:15.625 --> 17:17.708
and Amelia was his nurse.

17:17.958 --> 17:21.458
Amelia refused
to let the Professor
give in to self pity.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.708
In time, they fell in love.

17:31.375 --> 17:35.833
When Xavier returned
to America,
Amelia went with him.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.500
In the end,
it was the Professor's dream

17:38.500 --> 17:40.333
that drove them apart.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.583
Amelia hated being a mutant.

17:42.583 --> 17:46.500
She wanted the Professor
to live a private,
sheltered life with her.

17:46.875 --> 17:49.875
She told Charles
that there wasn't room
in his life

17:49.875 --> 17:52.458
for both her and the X-Men.

17:52.458 --> 17:56.625
When she left,
it was as if a part of Charles
had been destroyed.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.291
He sealed away his emotions
and lived only for his X-Men.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.875
His dream became
his entire world.

18:03.875 --> 18:07.500
He never saw Amelia,
never spoke of her again.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.166
[Gambit] Till today.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.833
-[Xavier] Amelia.
-What do you want?

18:11.833 --> 18:16.583
I... It has been a...
a long time.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.416
[laughs] Is that the best
you can do?

18:19.416 --> 18:22.583
-Amelia, please, listen to--
-What are you doing here?

18:22.583 --> 18:24.208
I get a chance at a new life,

18:24.208 --> 18:25.750
so you want to
screw this one up for me, too?

18:25.750 --> 18:27.875
I didn't ruin your life.

18:27.875 --> 18:31.625
I wanted to make our lives,
the lives of all mutants,
better.

18:31.625 --> 18:35.000
Well, I got news for you,
Charlie. You failed.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Your X-Men's fight for
mutant rights has made it
impossible for mutants

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
to live quietly
anywhere on Earth.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.625
Magneto may have
built Asteroid M,
but you made it necessary.

18:43.625 --> 18:45.833
[Xavier] Is this the life
you want, Amelia?

18:45.833 --> 18:48.958
Sealed in a floating prison,
like an insect in a jar?

18:49.416 --> 18:51.583
You're right. It's not fair.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.500
I don't think we have
anything more to discuss.

18:58.583 --> 19:01.958
Well, Mr. Cortez.

19:01.958 --> 19:04.708
To what do I owe this visit?

19:04.708 --> 19:07.833
You don't seem surprised,
Lord Magneto.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.291
Certainly not.

19:11.708 --> 19:14.708
It was you
who launched the warhead.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.875
You are a reckless young fool!

19:16.875 --> 19:22.375
Coward! You let flat-scan
humans eat at your table!

19:22.375 --> 19:25.833
I rule here!
I will not tolerate

19:25.833 --> 19:28.416
-your endangering my asteroid.
-I renounce you!

19:28.416 --> 19:31.000
You renounce me?

19:31.000 --> 19:32.583
Return!

19:32.583 --> 19:35.625
You are unfit to lead!

19:35.625 --> 19:38.458
My powers. I can't even...

19:38.458 --> 19:41.500
You exhausted your power
on Genosha, old man.

19:41.500 --> 19:46.000
I have sustained you
and I can destroy you!

19:46.333 --> 19:50.625
You don't have enough power
to hold your own
molecules together.

19:50.625 --> 19:55.000
Soon you will fade away
into nothing!

19:57.291 --> 20:01.875
You will serve our cause
much better as a martyr.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.708
[alarm buzzing]

20:06.500 --> 20:08.000
[Cortez] Help!

20:08.000 --> 20:09.500
This way!

20:10.000 --> 20:13.333
Help! Help!

20:15.458 --> 20:20.208
Traitors! They have destroyed
our beloved Magneto.

20:20.208 --> 20:22.375
Charles! What have you done?

20:22.375 --> 20:23.708
What do you mean?

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
When we arrived here,
we saw only Cortez!

20:27.000 --> 20:30.750
Liars! I saw them
jettison the chamber!

20:31.416 --> 20:33.208
[Cortez] Assassins!

20:33.208 --> 20:34.875
Gambit think we're outnumbered.

20:34.875 --> 20:38.500
Vengeance
for our lost Lord Magneto!

20:45.875 --> 20:46.958
