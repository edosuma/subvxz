00:00.449 --> 00:01.889
Big fight, man.

00:03.003 --> 00:06.378
You and me. Bringing home two belts.

00:06.409 --> 00:07.926
_

00:07.941 --> 00:09.923
I'm gonna move to San Francisco.

00:09.969 --> 00:11.238
Have the baby there.

00:11.254 --> 00:12.786
Why the fuck would you go to San Francisco?

00:12.833 --> 00:14.025
- Because of this.
- What?

00:14.056 --> 00:16.703
Giving 30 thousand dollars to Chapas?

00:16.734 --> 00:18.530
You fuck me on this, I'm gonna kill you.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.666
You'd have to find me first, motherfucker.

00:21.006 --> 00:22.477
Hey, dad. What happened?

00:22.508 --> 00:24.938
Renal failure. Irreversible.

00:24.980 --> 00:28.361
I'm not gonna be able to be at your
fight, really wanted to be there.

00:28.398 --> 00:31.642
I'll get somebody to film it, and then
I'll come over here, we can watch it after.

00:32.353 --> 00:33.530
Don't get sucked in.

00:33.926 --> 00:35.883
She is what she is.

00:35.957 --> 00:38.273
- You're not gonna change her.
- I'm not trying to change her.

00:38.681 --> 00:39.945
I'm trying to help her.

00:41.740 --> 00:42.830
Hands up!

00:47.504 --> 00:49.696
Ryan Wheeler, I'm coming for you.

00:50.612 --> 00:52.086
Come on, mom.

00:55.258 --> 00:56.769
Jury's still out on Ryan.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.639
He was lackluster in his previous fight.

00:58.664 --> 01:01.945
Either way, it's gonna be a
fantastic night for fight fans.

01:38.935 --> 01:41.569
Hey. Come on, man.

01:41.571 --> 01:43.771
It's time. Let's go. Come on.

01:43.773 --> 01:46.340
Ryan, get your ass off the
fucking floor and get out there.

01:46.342 --> 01:47.708
They're calling for you.

01:47.710 --> 01:49.443
I'm not going out there.
I don't want to fight.

01:49.445 --> 01:51.011
Oh, it's too late, man.
Fucking tickets have been sold.

01:51.013 --> 01:52.580
Money's been spent.
Fucking contract's signed.

01:52.582 --> 01:54.281
Fuck 'em, man. They can fucking sue me.

01:54.283 --> 01:55.749
- I don't care.
- Oh, they'll fucking sue you.

01:55.751 --> 01:56.951
You can't afford it.

01:56.953 --> 01:59.086
Alvey, I lost that last fucking fight.

01:59.088 --> 02:00.754
Aw, will you stop fucking
thinking about that?!

02:00.756 --> 02:01.889
I fucking suck, Alvey!

02:01.891 --> 02:03.090
You won! You fucking won.

02:03.092 --> 02:04.024
- And you were sick.
- No, no, no, no.

02:04.026 --> 02:05.559
I'm a fucking poser, dude!

02:05.561 --> 02:07.194
I told you, I don't have it in me, man.

02:07.196 --> 02:09.597
All right, I can't do this
every fucking time, bro!

02:09.598 --> 02:10.864
Because you weren't listening!

02:10.866 --> 02:13.534
I hate this shit, man.

02:13.536 --> 02:15.869
I don't want to fucking fight!

02:15.871 --> 02:17.605
- You'll fucking fight!
- I don't want to fight!

02:17.607 --> 02:20.741
You are fucking fighting, so
deal with it, motherfucker.

02:20.743 --> 02:23.711
You're fucking fighting.

02:23.713 --> 02:25.145
What do you need?

02:25.147 --> 02:26.447
Do you need to hear some
magical fucking words?

02:26.449 --> 02:27.715
- No, no, no, no.
- You need to hear that?

02:27.717 --> 02:29.416
You're the fucking champ, bro.

02:29.418 --> 02:31.752
You're a fucking god. You
are the Alpha fucking wolf.

02:31.754 --> 02:34.622
Pussy comes from miles to watch
you walk in that fucking cage.

02:34.624 --> 02:36.490
How's that? Does that feel fucking good?

02:36.492 --> 02:38.292
You feel strong? Get up. Come on.

02:38.294 --> 02:39.793
Come on, man.

02:39.795 --> 02:41.895
I'm fine with local pussy, too.

02:41.897 --> 02:43.397
Local pussy ain't fucking fine with you

02:43.399 --> 02:44.632
if you don't have a job.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.936
- Ryan...
- Please.

02:48.938 --> 02:51.739
Look at me.

02:51.741 --> 02:55.576
This is your fucking moment.

02:55.578 --> 02:57.344
Right now.

02:57.346 --> 02:59.747
You have clarity of purpose
like you may never have again

02:59.749 --> 03:01.582
the rest of your fucking life, son.

03:01.584 --> 03:03.617
I'm telling you, this is a rare privilege.

03:03.619 --> 03:05.953
Enjoy it.

03:05.955 --> 03:08.956
'Cause it will fucking end.

03:08.958 --> 03:11.892
It is going to end.

03:17.032 --> 03:20.167
Alvey, this is the last time
I'm ever fucking doing this.

03:20.169 --> 03:21.602
Done. Ever.

03:21.604 --> 03:23.309
- Never again.
- I'm serious.

03:23.339 --> 03:24.672
- I'm serious!
- I'm serious.

03:24.674 --> 03:26.440
I'm serious. I'm gonna
get you a nine-to-five

03:26.442 --> 03:28.275
in a fucking cubicle pushing
fucking dashes and zeroes, bro.

03:28.277 --> 03:30.611
- Fucking data processing.
- Wake me up.

03:30.613 --> 03:32.613
- Data processing!
- Fucking wake me up, Alvey!

03:32.615 --> 03:35.182
Who's the fucking champ?
Who's the fucking champ?

She's not picking up.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.513
I'm not fucking calling mom right now, Jay.

04:39.515 --> 04:41.081
Hey... shit. Nate.

04:41.083 --> 04:44.184
Dude, I need you to, uh...
To tape this for my dad okay?

04:44.186 --> 04:46.019
All right, all right. Hang on a second.

04:46.021 --> 04:47.187
He wants to see everything... Crowd...

04:47.189 --> 04:48.355
He will, he will, he will, he will.

Come on. Focus.

04:49.391 --> 04:51.859
Come on! Hang on a second!

04:51.861 --> 04:53.127
Point it at me. Is it pointed at me?

04:53.129 --> 04:55.062
Okay, okay. Hey, dad! What's going on?

04:55.064 --> 04:56.296
I'm 'bout to walk out right now.

04:56.298 --> 04:57.931
I'm feeling good. I'm ready.

04:57.933 --> 04:59.933
It's gonna be a good night,
and I wish you were here.

04:59.935 --> 05:01.435
- Got it.
- Good.

05:01.437 --> 05:02.803
Turn it on back when the music comes.

05:02.805 --> 05:03.971
- All right.
- Focus.

05:03.973 --> 05:04.738
I'm ready. I'm fucking ready!

05:04.740 --> 05:05.606
- Focus!
- Okay!

05:05.608 --> 05:06.907
- Can you call her?
- Mom?

05:06.909 --> 05:08.776
I'm not fucking calling
mom, Jay. What the fuck?

05:08.778 --> 05:10.544
Chapas?

05:10.546 --> 05:12.613
You motherfucking cunt.

05:12.615 --> 05:13.781
What the fuck is going on? I've
been looking all over for you.

05:13.783 --> 05:14.982
It's fine. We're good.

05:14.984 --> 05:16.150
- Is he on his fucking phone?
- No.

05:16.152 --> 05:17.284
- Alvey!
- No, no, no, no.

05:17.286 --> 05:18.719
- Alvey,
- I'm walking out right...

05:18.721 --> 05:20.387
- Just fucking wait.
- What the fuck, Alvey?!

05:20.389 --> 05:21.789
No. Fucking text me where you are.

05:21.791 --> 05:23.090
Alvey!

05:23.092 --> 05:24.558
- Just don't fucking move.
- What the fuck?

05:24.560 --> 05:26.126
Fucking text me where you are. Don't move.

05:26.128 --> 05:27.327
Jesus, Alvey!

05:27.329 --> 05:28.629
Focus! Focus!

05:28.631 --> 05:30.564
Go, go, go!

Get up! Get up!

06:37.633 --> 06:40.200
Stop it! You got to defend!

06:43.137 --> 06:44.238
Pressure! Pressure!

06:44.240 --> 06:45.973
Pull it over, Ryan!

06:45.975 --> 06:48.642
Pressure! Pressure!

06:53.715 --> 06:55.282
Go!

07:06.160 --> 07:09.229

07:11.666 --> 07:13.000
Come on!

07:15.770 --> 07:17.838
Get out of it! Get out of it!

07:17.840 --> 07:19.506
Get out of it!

07:24.345 --> 07:27.180
Let go of the fence! Let go of the fence!

07:27.182 --> 07:30.250
You fucking bitch. Fuck you, bitch!

07:33.187 --> 07:34.421
Smart!

Defend yourself! Defend yourself!

07:44.967 --> 07:46.700
Finish it! Finish it!

Thank you to Navy Street!

08:10.559 --> 08:12.759
Ladies and gentlemen, the official time,

08:12.761 --> 08:16.163
4 minutes and 33 seconds
of the very first round,

08:16.165 --> 08:17.998
your winner by knockout,

08:18.000 --> 08:23.236
and still the... Lightweight
champion of the world,

08:23.238 --> 08:28.642
Ryan Wheeler!

08:28.644 --> 08:31.178
All right. I am here with
your winner, Ryan Wheeler.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.614
Ryan, emphatic victory.
Vicious knockout, man.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.582
What were you looking
to prove here tonight?

08:36.585 --> 08:37.851
I mean, I'm not here...

08:37.852 --> 08:39.686
I'm not trying to prove anything, man.

08:39.688 --> 08:42.856
This was just straight,
professional violence, Kenny.

08:42.857 --> 08:44.424
I mean, it's not... You know, it's...

08:44.426 --> 08:46.026
I don't come in here to fuck around, man.

08:46.028 --> 08:48.462
I'm in here to inflict maximum damage

08:48.464 --> 08:52.366
and just... I mean... dude,
it's a violent business, man.

08:52.368 --> 08:55.202
And business is pretty
fucking good right now.

08:55.204 --> 08:56.770
You came into this one

08:56.772 --> 08:58.638
way more aggressive than
your previous fight.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.507
Uh, was that the strategy for this one?

09:00.509 --> 09:02.809
To... to kick his fucking
ass? Yeah, it was.

09:02.811 --> 09:04.678
I mean, that's always...
It's always the strategy.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.979
Coach Kulina preaches that.

09:05.981 --> 09:07.781
It's how we train every single d...

09:07.783 --> 09:09.950
I mean, I came in here
with a messed-up rib.

09:09.952 --> 09:12.119
That's just how we fucking
do it at Navy Street, right?

09:12.121 --> 09:13.854
Well, you certainly
proved your point tonight.

09:13.856 --> 09:15.455
Congratulations.

09:15.457 --> 09:17.624
I-I want to thank my dad.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.626
Uh, dad, I know you
wanted to be here tonight.

09:19.628 --> 09:20.961
You're with me all the time.

09:20.963 --> 09:22.662
Greatest man I've ever known.

09:22.664 --> 09:25.065
I love you, dad. And, uh...

09:25.067 --> 09:26.299
And Jay Kulina!

09:26.301 --> 09:29.169
I heard you, bro. I heard you.

09:29.171 --> 09:31.872
You're a brother, but it's
just fucking business, baby.

09:31.874 --> 09:33.040
It's just business.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.342
It's just business.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.217
So, I'm thinking Alvey will go first,

09:44.219 --> 09:46.053
and then Jay, and then Ryan.

09:46.055 --> 09:48.321
Okay. And while we're here,
I'd love to get Nate, as well.

09:48.323 --> 09:50.724
I'm sure you would, Kenny.

09:50.726 --> 09:52.426
- Alvey.
- Hey. Not now.

09:52.428 --> 09:53.894
I can't do it right now.

09:53.896 --> 09:55.996
It'll take two seconds. I'm really sorry.

09:55.998 --> 09:57.531
Kenny, I am really fucking sorry.

09:57.533 --> 09:58.932
Come to the gym. I give
you anything you need.

09:58.934 --> 09:59.900
I promise. I love you.

09:59.902 --> 10:00.934
It will take two seconds.

10:00.936 --> 10:02.269
I love you. I'm sorry.

10:02.271 --> 10:03.270
- Alvey!
- I'm sorry. I love you!

10:03.272 --> 10:05.405
Sorry!

10:41.276 --> 10:43.243
Aah! You fuck!

10:43.245 --> 10:45.145
You motherfucker.

10:45.147 --> 10:46.913
Shh!

10:46.915 --> 10:48.582
Shhh.

10:48.584 --> 10:50.984
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

10:50.986 --> 10:52.252
Shut up.

10:52.254 --> 10:55.956
Stay down. You fucking stay down.

10:55.958 --> 10:59.259
This what you do with my fucking money?

10:59.261 --> 11:01.161
- That's what you do with my money?
- No, man.

11:01.163 --> 11:02.562
- Calm down.
- Calm down?

11:02.564 --> 11:04.331
Gah! Fuck.

11:04.333 --> 11:06.099
Motherfucker.

11:06.101 --> 11:07.400
That's funny? That's funny, right?

11:07.402 --> 11:08.969
Yeah, boo. You lost a little power.

11:08.971 --> 11:10.804
Did I?! Fucking did I?!

11:16.144 --> 11:18.245
Fuck.

11:23.651 --> 11:26.920
You fucking ripped me off.

11:26.922 --> 11:29.156
What'd you do with my money, motherfucker?

11:29.158 --> 11:31.124
What'd you do with my money?

11:31.126 --> 11:34.327
Fuck!

11:34.329 --> 11:35.862
You fucking cunt.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.102
Where's my fucking money, bro?

11:44.939 --> 11:49.543
This is gonna be a long...
Fucking night for you.

11:54.515 --> 11:56.116
Mom?

11:58.052 --> 12:00.086
Mom?

12:01.622 --> 12:03.590
Whaaam!

12:07.461 --> 12:09.529
- Ohh...
- Jay!

12:09.531 --> 12:11.198
Come here.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.034
Mom?

12:21.242 --> 12:22.709
Hmm.

12:24.845 --> 12:28.081
One for you, one for me.

12:29.551 --> 12:30.483
Gracias.

12:33.521 --> 12:35.355
Ahh. De nada.

12:38.159 --> 12:41.194
It was a great fucking fight.

12:41.196 --> 12:44.331
I was very impressive.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.899
I'm gonna go check on mom.

12:45.901 --> 12:47.167
Hey, hold up. Hold up.

12:47.169 --> 12:48.635
I want to... I want to say something.

12:50.671 --> 12:52.138
Come here.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.678
I want to say I'm proud of you.

12:58.680 --> 13:02.015
I know what you've done for me.

13:02.017 --> 13:03.783
My whole fucking life.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.589
You've taken a lot of
shit so I didn't have to.

13:13.694 --> 13:15.662
I'll never forget that.

13:28.377 --> 13:29.809
Bitches and money.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.381
What's that?

13:34.383 --> 13:36.883
To bitches and money.

13:36.885 --> 13:39.386
To bitches...

13:39.388 --> 13:41.221
And money.

13:41.223 --> 13:42.555
Waah!

13:46.061 --> 13:47.560
It's good.

13:47.562 --> 13:50.063
Good escape.

13:51.966 --> 13:54.000
Nice. Very nice.

13:54.002 --> 13:56.736
Very nice.

13:56.738 --> 13:58.605
Great fight.

13:58.607 --> 14:00.140
- Great fight.
- Thanks.

14:00.142 --> 14:01.908
That ought to shut some people up.

14:01.910 --> 14:05.412
Yeah, well, they'll still
find something to shit on,

14:05.414 --> 14:07.180
but they always do.

14:10.785 --> 14:12.886
How you doing?

14:14.155 --> 14:15.955
Pour us a drink, huh?

14:15.957 --> 14:17.190
Yes, sir.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.172
You talk to your mother?

14:34.508 --> 14:36.609
Not in a couple weeks.

14:36.611 --> 14:39.479
She's afraid to bother you.

14:39.481 --> 14:41.815
Call her.

14:41.817 --> 14:43.416
Yes, sir.

14:45.186 --> 14:50.623
I'm going to have to move to a facility.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.826
Why?

14:52.828 --> 14:56.029
Dad, you got everything you need here.

14:56.031 --> 14:59.199
We don't have the money.

14:59.201 --> 15:01.534
Your mom and I discussed it.

15:01.536 --> 15:03.470
We're moving me next week.

15:03.472 --> 15:07.540
Dad, do you want to stay here?

15:07.542 --> 15:09.542
That's irrelevant.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.416
I can help out. I mean, I...

15:16.418 --> 15:21.654
Ryan, this is how it goes.

15:21.656 --> 15:24.758
Let's not piss into the wind, huh?

15:31.665 --> 15:32.999
Mom?

15:41.008 --> 15:42.742
Mom!

15:47.615 --> 15:49.516
Mom?

15:49.518 --> 15:51.418
Mom? Mom?

15:51.420 --> 15:53.186
Mom! Mom!!

15:53.188 --> 15:55.188
Mom! Fuck! Mom! Hey!

15:55.190 --> 15:56.589
Hey, wake the fuck up!

15:56.591 --> 15:58.191
Mom? Hey! Hey, breathe, mom!

15:58.193 --> 15:59.359
- Come on! Wake up.
- What happened?

15:59.361 --> 16:00.760
Will you please fucking breathe?

16:00.762 --> 16:01.928
- Jay, what the fuck happened?
- Mom!

16:01.930 --> 16:03.263
Fuck! She fucking D.D.'d, Nate!

16:03.265 --> 16:04.564
Can you get her to breathe, please?

16:04.566 --> 16:05.865
For a second. Come over and help.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.434
Hey! Wake up, mom!

16:07.436 --> 16:08.802
Come on, come on, come on, come on, mom!

16:08.804 --> 16:10.870
Hold her head up, dude, and talk to her,

16:10.872 --> 16:12.038
and try to get her to fucking
breathe or something right now, okay?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.540
- Where are you going?
- Just do it.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.041
- What the fuck you doing?
- Fuck, just do it, dude!

16:15.043 --> 16:17.977
Get her breathing! Talk to her!

16:17.979 --> 16:19.045
Mom?

16:23.151 --> 16:24.818
- Jay, what do I...
- Is she breathing?

16:24.820 --> 16:25.885
Should I call an ambulance?

16:25.887 --> 16:27.153
Dude, just stop for a second!

16:27.155 --> 16:28.221
Is she breathing?

16:28.223 --> 16:29.889
Barely. I don't know.

16:29.891 --> 16:31.291
Get her fucking head up,
dude, and get her breathing.

16:31.293 --> 16:32.559
Just get her breathing.

16:32.561 --> 16:35.228
Mom! Mom, stay fucking with us!

16:35.230 --> 16:36.896
Please, mom!

16:36.898 --> 16:38.264
What'd you get? What the fuck is that, Jay?

16:38.266 --> 16:40.066
It's narcan from Mac.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.601
What are you doing?

16:41.603 --> 16:42.902
Hold her fucking head steady.

16:42.904 --> 16:44.170
What?

16:44.172 --> 16:45.505
Get her... fuck. Get her head back!

16:45.507 --> 16:46.906
Get her head back so she doesn't choke!

16:51.179 --> 16:53.947
Come on, mom. Come on, mom!

16:53.949 --> 16:55.615
Come on, mom, breathe!

16:55.617 --> 16:58.117
Mom, fucking wake up, please!

16:58.119 --> 16:59.352
Mom?

17:07.929 --> 17:09.194
What are you doing?

17:09.196 --> 17:10.463
Yeah, mom, there you go! Hang on. Whoa!

17:10.464 --> 17:12.999
Up, up, up. Get up, get up, get up.

17:13.001 --> 17:16.002
It's us. Breathe. Breathe.

17:16.003 --> 17:17.369
Breathe, ma.

17:17.372 --> 17:19.771
Breathe. We're good. You're good.

17:19.773 --> 17:22.208
You're gonna make it.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.377
You're gonna make it.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.621
I was really fucking scared.

17:34.623 --> 17:36.389
It was so fucking...

17:36.391 --> 17:38.458
It's okay. It's okay.

17:55.010 --> 17:56.809
Where's my money?

18:00.348 --> 18:02.882
Don't fuck with me,
Chapas. I'm not that guy.

18:02.884 --> 18:04.851
Oh, yeah, that's where I fucked up.

18:04.853 --> 18:07.420
See, I thought you were that guy.

18:07.422 --> 18:09.489
I picked the wrong mark, huh?

18:09.491 --> 18:13.326
Where's my motherfucking money, dude?

18:13.328 --> 18:15.395
- Your money?
- Yeah.

18:15.397 --> 18:17.697
Ah...

18:17.699 --> 18:19.866
Sorry, brother. You made a bad investment.

18:19.868 --> 18:23.102
Oh, oh, did I?

18:23.104 --> 18:25.004
I'm gonna make you whole, Alvey.

18:25.006 --> 18:27.840
Oh, yeah? Uh-huh.

18:27.842 --> 18:30.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What...
Where you going, playboy?

18:30.078 --> 18:34.347
There's a bag behind the fridge.

18:34.349 --> 18:35.882
May I?

18:35.884 --> 18:37.517
Slow.

18:37.519 --> 18:38.585
Don't be stupid.

18:55.636 --> 18:58.037
Son of a bitch.

18:58.039 --> 19:00.006
Sit down. Sit down.

19:05.546 --> 19:06.879
That's not your money.

19:06.881 --> 19:08.214
- Oh, that's not my money?
- No.

19:08.216 --> 19:10.550
That's some other motherfucker's money.

19:10.552 --> 19:14.721
Your money is spread among
several other motherfuckers.

19:16.891 --> 19:19.125
What the fuck are you into?

19:19.127 --> 19:21.661
Not a goddamn thing anymore.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.633
May I?

19:28.569 --> 19:32.238
What did I invest in?

19:32.240 --> 19:37.410
You invested in me not
getting my head chopped off.

19:37.412 --> 19:40.647
I owed a lot of money to
some very serious people.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.184
I was doing well, Alvey.

19:45.186 --> 19:47.120
I was... I was making money.

19:47.122 --> 19:49.022
I was.

19:49.024 --> 19:51.591
But then I overextended.

19:52.861 --> 19:54.627
A couple deals didn't go through.

19:54.629 --> 19:56.295
Man, shit got ugly really fast.

19:56.297 --> 19:59.098
And I thought I could dig out.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.467
I thought I could dig out.

20:01.469 --> 20:03.336
So I started bringing in
some people, you know,

20:03.338 --> 20:04.871
to cover my debts,

20:04.873 --> 20:06.272
and then I brought in some
other people to cover them,

20:06.274 --> 20:08.608
and

20:08.610 --> 20:10.376
You know, just typical Ponzi shit.

20:10.378 --> 20:12.545
Fuck.

20:12.547 --> 20:14.380
Jesus Christ.

20:14.382 --> 20:15.882
Mm-hmm.

20:15.884 --> 20:18.451
I couldn't do it to you, man.

20:18.453 --> 20:20.620
I couldn't hang you out like that.

20:20.622 --> 20:21.821
This for me?

20:21.823 --> 20:23.289
Yeah.

20:30.465 --> 20:32.198
Look, take a little bit of
fucking money, all right?

20:32.200 --> 20:34.367
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, buddy, that's...

20:34.369 --> 20:36.369
Chapas. Chapas,

20:36.371 --> 20:38.037
I'm not gonna let you
get fucking killed, okay?

20:38.039 --> 20:39.472
Listen. Listen.

20:39.474 --> 20:41.908
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
disappear, clear the deck.

20:41.910 --> 20:45.178
It's a fucking relief, man.

20:45.180 --> 20:47.146
Look at... Look how I been living.

20:49.484 --> 20:52.418
Why do I want to hang around here anymore?

21:28.689 --> 21:31.090
Well, I think we'll be staying in tonight.

21:37.064 --> 21:39.031
She okay?

21:39.033 --> 21:42.902
Yeah, I think it just
scared the hell out of her.

21:42.904 --> 21:45.972
Scared the hell out of me, too.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.576
So, Mac gave you that?

21:50.578 --> 21:52.612
Yeah, when mom moved in.

21:57.918 --> 22:01.053
You're gonna need more of it.

22:01.055 --> 22:03.656
'Cause this is gonna happen again.

22:06.460 --> 22:08.528
You know that, right?

22:13.801 --> 22:18.237
I just don't understand why
you think it's gonna change.

22:18.239 --> 22:22.942
'Cause... It's not.

22:22.944 --> 22:24.677
What else we supposed to do?

22:24.679 --> 22:26.646
Well, you can't watch her all the time.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.420
I can try.

22:36.423 --> 22:39.492
You got no idea, Alvey. You don't know.

22:39.494 --> 22:41.928
I don't know what?

22:41.930 --> 22:44.430
What it's like to have nothing.

22:44.432 --> 22:46.499
You don't think I know?

22:46.501 --> 22:49.202
No, I mean what it's truly
like to have nothing.

22:49.204 --> 22:52.772
You know, no place,

22:52.774 --> 22:55.374
nothing in front, nothing behind.

22:55.376 --> 22:58.544
No one to see if you're all right.

22:58.546 --> 23:00.847
What the fuck happened to Misha?

23:04.351 --> 23:06.719
You know what happened. She O.D.'d.

23:06.721 --> 23:08.120
No, motherfucker. You said...

23:08.122 --> 23:09.689
The night that we got fucking busted,

23:09.691 --> 23:10.823
you said it was your fault.

23:10.825 --> 23:13.826
Some shit like that.

23:13.828 --> 23:16.362
- I said that?
- Yeah.

23:20.133 --> 23:22.335
I was taking so many fucking pills.

23:22.337 --> 23:25.705
She... she was just trying to keep up.

23:25.707 --> 23:27.240
That's what I meant.

23:27.242 --> 23:30.243
Uh-huh. That what you meant?

23:30.245 --> 23:33.479
I got to go, man.

23:33.481 --> 23:35.648
You are one fucked-up dude.
I want you to take this.

23:35.650 --> 23:37.817
I want you to fucking
disappear, you understand me?

23:37.819 --> 23:40.319
No, no, no. Alvey... Alvey.

23:40.321 --> 23:44.924
Listen, I... I got a plan.

23:44.926 --> 23:47.326
I got a plan. It's okay.

23:47.328 --> 23:51.097
Don't worry about me.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.500
And you...

23:56.203 --> 23:59.438
You're a good friend. You know that?

24:01.174 --> 24:03.743
Alvey.

24:03.745 --> 24:05.678
I'm sorry, man.

24:08.082 --> 24:09.849
I'm sorry I put you through this.

24:09.851 --> 24:11.083
Me too.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.488
Good luck, bro.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.858
Aah! Aah!

24:21.362 --> 24:23.362
You're not gonna shoot me, man.

24:23.364 --> 24:25.264
It's money. Here. You
want the fucking money?

24:25.266 --> 24:27.867
Take the money.

24:27.869 --> 24:29.702
- It's okay.
- Bro. Take the money.

24:29.704 --> 24:30.870
Take the money. I don't want the money.

24:30.872 --> 24:33.339
- Don't do that.
- Aah!

24:38.479 --> 24:39.645
Oh, fuck.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.549
Oh, you motherfuck.

24:43.551 --> 24:46.686
No, no, no. You didn't do this to me.

24:48.622 --> 24:50.556
You fuck.

24:50.558 --> 24:53.826
Oh, you fuck. Ah, fuck!

24:53.828 --> 24:55.995
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

25:26.961 --> 25:31.430
You know, Nathaniel,

25:31.432 --> 25:33.833
I'd say we hit bottom.

25:36.103 --> 25:38.871
But I had a great fight.

25:38.873 --> 25:41.774
Everyone's alive.

25:41.776 --> 25:44.677
We're together.

25:44.679 --> 25:47.480
Got this bottle of Tequila.

25:47.482 --> 25:49.982
By the pool.

25:49.984 --> 25:53.686
I mean, on paper...

25:53.688 --> 25:56.022
We look pretty goddamn good.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.693
We're killing it.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.979
Your toast.

26:19.981 --> 26:22.681
Earlier.

26:22.683 --> 26:24.383
It was hard for me to hear.

26:26.987 --> 26:30.056
I'm sorry for having emotions.

26:30.058 --> 26:34.126
No, it's, um... I should've
never let you take that fight.

26:35.996 --> 26:38.164
I knew it was a mistake.
I should've stood up.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.598
I should've said something.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.500
You got to stop.

26:41.502 --> 26:43.269
It's just that I had my head

26:43.271 --> 26:47.540
so far up my fucking ass from
the weight cut and Laura...

26:47.542 --> 26:50.009
I took my focus off of you.

26:54.347 --> 26:57.016
I think you're right, though.

26:57.018 --> 26:58.851
About Fresno.

27:02.355 --> 27:05.357
It was a really big fucking mistake.

27:05.359 --> 27:08.527
Might surprise you to learn

27:08.529 --> 27:11.330
I, too, have made a few mistakes.

27:12.532 --> 27:14.700
Ahh.

27:14.702 --> 27:17.036
And check me out now.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.880
Can I join you?

27:29.216 --> 27:31.450
Yeah, mom. Of course.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.336
You okay?

28:02.016 --> 28:05.484
Hey.

28:05.486 --> 28:08.587
What are you doing here?

28:08.589 --> 28:11.524
I came to drop off my key.

28:11.526 --> 28:13.759
You could've left it at the gym.

28:15.162 --> 28:17.062
Where have you been?

28:27.307 --> 28:29.542
Alvey, what's wrong?

28:29.544 --> 28:31.710
What's wrong?

28:35.715 --> 28:38.717
Chapas is dead.

28:38.719 --> 28:40.352
What?

28:42.122 --> 28:44.957
He shot himself in the
head right in front of me.

28:44.959 --> 28:46.792
My gun.

28:46.794 --> 28:49.695
Oh, my god.

28:49.697 --> 28:53.299
Wh-where?

28:53.301 --> 28:55.734
Some fucking motel.

28:55.736 --> 28:58.637
He owed a lot of people money.

28:58.639 --> 29:02.775
I beat the fuck out of him, Lise.

29:04.177 --> 29:05.811
I got it all back.

29:05.813 --> 29:07.846
All $30,000.

29:07.848 --> 29:09.548
Every fucking dime.

29:11.484 --> 29:14.987
- But it was your gun.
- Yeah.

29:14.989 --> 29:16.655
And where is it now?

29:16.657 --> 29:18.657
I fucking cleaned it
off and I left it there.

29:18.659 --> 29:21.160
What do you mean you cleaned
it off and you left it there?

29:21.162 --> 29:23.229
- It comes back to me, I say...
- Alvey, do you know how easy it is

29:23.231 --> 29:25.197
- to trace that back to you?
- I say he fucking stole it.

29:25.199 --> 29:27.833
The guy's a fucking thief, right?

29:27.835 --> 29:31.136
He committed suicide. He did it.

29:33.873 --> 29:35.674
You should've fucking seen him, too.

29:35.676 --> 29:37.543
He smiled right at me.

29:37.545 --> 29:39.612
He smiled.

29:39.614 --> 29:42.514
Like he solved a problem.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.885
Fuck.

29:50.857 --> 29:53.726
Sometimes I think maybe
you guys are better off

29:53.728 --> 29:56.428
without me at this point.

29:57.864 --> 30:01.133
I missed all the years I
could've made a difference.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.238
Mom...

30:06.240 --> 30:09.708
We need you in different ways now.

30:09.710 --> 30:11.810
Do we?

30:11.812 --> 30:13.712
Yes.

30:16.549 --> 30:20.219
Can you think of one thing
you've done for us today?

30:20.221 --> 30:21.487
Hey.

30:21.489 --> 30:22.521
What?

30:24.224 --> 30:26.959
I can't.

30:26.961 --> 30:31.196
Can you think of one thing
you've ever done for us?

30:39.506 --> 30:42.408
You're absolutely right.

30:42.410 --> 30:43.976
We don't need you.

30:43.978 --> 30:46.912
Hey.

30:46.914 --> 30:51.817
Still, Jay shot himself
full of your heroin...

30:51.819 --> 30:55.421
Nearly fucking killed himself...

30:55.423 --> 30:57.923
Just to try to get through to you.

30:59.426 --> 31:01.327
Did that even bother you?

31:04.197 --> 31:05.931
It broke my heart.

31:05.933 --> 31:07.499
Yeah.

31:07.501 --> 31:09.868
Not enough to stop.

31:09.870 --> 31:11.537
It I enough.

31:11.539 --> 31:14.573
Well, then fucking do it.

31:16.676 --> 31:19.044
Or get the fuck out of here.

31:21.281 --> 31:25.117
'Cause I'm not gonna
lose my brother over you.

31:46.973 --> 31:49.842
Kenny's coming by for
the interview tomorrow.

31:49.844 --> 31:52.144
And I have some things to
pick up from the office,

31:52.146 --> 31:53.779
so I'll be there.

31:57.016 --> 32:00.486
Alvey, what the fuck are
you gonna do about that gun?

32:02.655 --> 32:04.823
I'm gonna figure it out.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.530
- Don't go.
- What?

32:11.532 --> 32:14.500
Just don't... don't go.

32:14.502 --> 32:17.102
I want you to stay. We
can... we can work this out.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.104
- We tried.
- Not hard enough.

32:19.106 --> 32:21.373
- I'm not giving up.
- You should.

32:21.375 --> 32:24.843
Just listen to me.

32:24.845 --> 32:26.111
There's nothing more to say.

32:26.113 --> 32:27.112
- I'm going.
- Just stop.

32:27.114 --> 32:28.447
- Stop. Stop.
- Alvey...

32:28.449 --> 32:29.782
No.

32:29.784 --> 32:32.751
Sit down. Please.

32:32.753 --> 32:34.686
Please.

32:45.765 --> 32:49.802
I'm gonna be completely
fucking honest here, okay,

32:49.804 --> 32:52.538
because why the fuck not? This is it.

32:52.540 --> 32:54.706
You told me you were pregnant.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.575
It scared the shit out of me, Lise.

32:56.577 --> 32:58.210
I'm too fucking old.

32:58.212 --> 33:00.045
I'm gonna fuck this up.

33:00.047 --> 33:01.980
And you know who I am.

33:01.982 --> 33:04.783
When I get scared, I-I-I get nuts.

33:04.785 --> 33:08.387
I'm all over the place.

33:08.389 --> 33:10.789
And that scared the hell out of you, too,

33:10.791 --> 33:13.225
because you've never done this before,

33:13.227 --> 33:15.093
and I've never done it well.

33:15.095 --> 33:18.230
We need each other.

33:18.232 --> 33:21.500
This baby is a gift.

33:21.502 --> 33:25.938
I want to see you chasing
this baby around the gym.

33:25.940 --> 33:29.341
We'll get married. That's
what I fucking want.

33:29.343 --> 33:32.678
That's a real fucking life.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.012
It's right in front of me,

33:34.014 --> 33:35.814
and I'm not running away from it.

33:35.816 --> 33:39.618
From now on, all that
matters is you and this baby.

33:39.620 --> 33:40.752
That is it.

33:40.754 --> 33:42.988
I swear to you. I promise.

33:42.990 --> 33:45.924
Don't leave me.

33:45.926 --> 33:48.760
I don't want to be without you.

33:59.005 --> 34:01.306
Is there anything else?

34:01.308 --> 34:04.643
Yeah.

34:04.645 --> 34:08.280
Yeah, you know, what do
you think about that?

34:08.282 --> 34:11.683
What do I think?

34:11.685 --> 34:14.887
I think you saw your friend kill himself,

34:14.889 --> 34:17.289
and you're in shock.

34:17.291 --> 34:20.324
I think you're thinking
about your own death.

34:20.327 --> 34:21.659
No.

34:21.661 --> 34:23.128
No, that's not what this is about.

34:23.130 --> 34:24.730
That's exactly what this is about.

34:24.732 --> 34:26.632
No, wait. Just wait.

34:26.634 --> 34:28.033
Just... just sit down.

34:28.034 --> 34:30.536
What do you think is gonna
happen right now, huh?

34:30.538 --> 34:32.404
You think we're gonna pile on the couch

34:32.406 --> 34:33.572
and feel the baby kick?

34:33.574 --> 34:34.873
I'm telling you how I feel.

34:34.875 --> 34:36.408
I don't give a fuck how you feel.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.976
You don't give a fuck how I feel.

34:38.978 --> 34:40.913
Everything you just said was about you.

34:40.915 --> 34:42.380
It's about us.

34:42.382 --> 34:44.483
No, it's about how me and
this baby can save you.

34:44.485 --> 34:47.252
Well, you know what? I
don't want that job anymore.

34:47.254 --> 34:48.920
I'm not fucking interested.

34:50.424 --> 34:52.524
Oh, and if you want to be
a part of this kid's life,

34:52.525 --> 34:55.027
then start getting your shit together.

34:55.029 --> 34:57.663
'Cause I'm not gonna let you fuck him up.

35:10.677 --> 35:12.277
Dad?

35:12.279 --> 35:15.514
Dad. What's wrong? What's wrong?

35:15.516 --> 35:17.015
What's wrong?

35:17.017 --> 35:18.850
A-anxiety pill.

35:18.852 --> 35:19.751
Anxiety...

35:19.753 --> 35:21.286
- Please.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:21.288 --> 35:23.522
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

35:23.524 --> 35:25.457
Okay. Hold on. Hold on, I got you.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.359
I got you, dad.

35:29.229 --> 35:31.897
Ready? Ready? Ready?

35:34.034 --> 35:36.735
There we go. There we go.

35:36.737 --> 35:40.072
Goddamn attacks. Every...
every fucking night.

35:40.074 --> 35:43.642
Shh. It's okay. Hey.
That'll work. That'll help.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.243
It'll work in just a second, okay?

35:45.245 --> 35:47.079
It'll work. It'll work.

35:47.081 --> 35:48.814
Ryan. Ryan...

35:48.816 --> 35:50.649
Don't leave me like this.

35:50.651 --> 35:52.651
I ain't going anywhere, dad.

35:52.653 --> 35:53.552
I'm right here.

35:53.554 --> 35:56.121
I'm not going anywhere.

35:56.123 --> 35:58.757
I can't take it anymore.

35:58.759 --> 35:59.925
You're doing good.

35:59.927 --> 36:01.326
Let me go.

36:01.328 --> 36:02.894
Kill me, Ryan.

36:02.896 --> 36:04.062
- What?
- Let me go.

36:04.064 --> 36:05.731
What? No, no, no. Dad, what?

36:05.733 --> 36:07.466
Ryan, fuck.

36:07.468 --> 36:08.767
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I'm in pain.

36:08.769 --> 36:10.002
I can't fucking take it anymore.

36:10.004 --> 36:11.069
- Dad. Dad.
- I'm ready.

36:11.071 --> 36:12.771
- I want to die.
- No, no, no!

36:12.773 --> 36:14.673
No! Fuck no! No!

36:14.675 --> 36:15.907
No! No, no, no, no!

36:15.909 --> 36:17.175
- No!
- Ryan... Ryan...

36:17.177 --> 36:18.610
- No!
- We're good.

36:18.612 --> 36:20.412
We're good. We're good.
You and me are good.

36:20.414 --> 36:21.813
- Dad, shh!
- Ryan?

36:21.815 --> 36:24.349
Shh. No, no, no. No. No, no.

36:24.351 --> 36:25.651
We're... we're good.

36:25.653 --> 36:27.586
You and me... You and me, we're good.

36:27.588 --> 36:29.454
Dad? Dad! Wha... no, what are you even...

36:29.456 --> 36:31.857
I forgave you. Do this for me!

36:31.859 --> 36:33.492
What are you asking me
to do?! No, no, no, no!

36:33.494 --> 36:36.695
Do this for me, Ryan. God
damn it, please, Ryan!

36:36.697 --> 36:40.932
Ryan, god damn it!

36:40.934 --> 36:42.668
What the fuck?!

36:42.670 --> 36:44.936
Ryan!

36:46.774 --> 36:48.140
Please, Ryan!

36:48.142 --> 36:49.374
Okay.

36:52.178 --> 36:53.879
Ryan!

36:53.881 --> 36:54.780
Fuck you!

36:54.782 --> 36:56.882
Fuck you!

36:56.884 --> 36:58.717
Fuck you!

36:58.719 --> 37:00.352
Fuck...

37:02.355 --> 37:04.456
Ryan!!

37:06.392 --> 37:08.560
Fuck you...

37:08.562 --> 37:10.128
You...

37:45.264 --> 37:46.732
What is up?

37:46.734 --> 37:49.568
What's going on? What are you doing?

37:49.570 --> 37:52.771
I'm eating and drinking.

37:52.773 --> 37:56.174
Where are you?

37:56.176 --> 37:58.443
I'm at home.

37:58.445 --> 38:00.245
Already?

38:00.247 --> 38:03.348
Yeah, dude. It's like...

38:03.350 --> 38:05.350
It's 3:00 in the morning.

38:05.352 --> 38:09.287
Oh, shit.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.356
Where are you?

38:11.358 --> 38:14.359
Uh, I'm at my dad's.

38:16.863 --> 38:19.431
Did you show him the fight?

38:19.433 --> 38:21.867
Yeah.

38:21.869 --> 38:23.735
Yeah.

38:23.737 --> 38:25.704
Uh...

38:25.706 --> 38:27.806
What'd everybody do tonight?

38:27.808 --> 38:30.041
Um, Jack shit.

38:30.043 --> 38:31.643
We stayed at home.

38:31.645 --> 38:34.346
Why?

38:36.449 --> 38:39.050
My mom.

38:39.052 --> 38:40.452
Fucked up.

38:40.454 --> 38:43.922
Oh.

38:43.924 --> 38:45.891
Dude, I'm sorry.

38:45.893 --> 38:47.793
That sucks.

38:49.562 --> 38:52.731
Man, I want to get so fucked up right now.

38:55.669 --> 38:57.068
How 'bout tomorrow?

38:57.070 --> 38:59.905
Done.

38:59.907 --> 39:03.008
May peace be with you.

39:03.010 --> 39:05.243
And also with you.

39:05.245 --> 39:06.411
Bye.

39:06.413 --> 39:08.146
Love you too. Bye.

41:49.475 --> 41:51.176
This is fucking weird.

41:51.178 --> 41:52.744
It's super weird.

41:52.746 --> 41:54.879
I don't like it.

42:00.419 --> 42:03.621
Hey, I got you something.

42:08.260 --> 42:09.861
"Mama."

42:09.863 --> 42:13.064
I love it. Thank you.

42:15.134 --> 42:16.468
We're gonna talk all the time,

42:16.470 --> 42:18.269
'cause you're gonna
have a ton of questions.

42:18.271 --> 42:20.538
Yeah. I'll try not to bother you too much.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.207
No, you better fucking bother me.

42:22.209 --> 42:25.276
I'll miss you.

42:25.278 --> 42:27.045
You too.

42:29.348 --> 42:32.684
All right. You should go.
You're gonna hit traffic.

42:32.686 --> 42:34.019
Yeah.

42:38.657 --> 42:40.725
Hey.

42:42.528 --> 42:46.798
Can you, um, water my plants for me?

42:46.800 --> 42:49.100
Every day.

43:42.721 --> 43:45.356
This one is deluxe.

43:45.358 --> 43:49.694
"While based on a 12-step program,

43:49.696 --> 43:51.596
we offer a variety

43:51.598 --> 43:54.699
of evidence-based treatment modalities,

43:54.701 --> 44:00.772
including but not limited
to yoga and meditation,

44:00.774 --> 44:04.375
acupuncture, art therapy"...

44:04.377 --> 44:07.812
I don't want art.

44:07.814 --> 44:10.081
Fuck art.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.217
Art's off the list.

44:12.219 --> 44:16.087
"Dialectical behavioral therapy."

44:16.089 --> 44:18.389
Very cutting edge.

44:18.391 --> 44:21.059
Sounds expensive.

44:21.061 --> 44:24.062
We can't afford any of this.

44:24.064 --> 44:25.830
We're just browsing.

44:25.832 --> 44:27.966
But why? We're broke.

44:27.968 --> 44:31.035
I don't have insurance.

44:38.677 --> 44:41.179
You're not backing out of this.

44:41.181 --> 44:44.649
I will find the money.

44:47.453 --> 44:50.588
This is going to happen.

44:53.626 --> 44:56.161
We're not gonna live like this anymore.

45:08.040 --> 45:10.108
Oh.

45:10.110 --> 45:11.342
Yeah.

45:11.344 --> 45:13.378
You're gonna like this.

45:13.380 --> 45:15.647
"Psychodrama.

45:15.649 --> 45:19.184
Reclaim your natural human emotions."

45:21.387 --> 45:23.221
Sounds right up my alley.

45:41.641 --> 45:43.141
Side mouth, side mouth.

45:43.143 --> 45:44.242
Got it.

45:51.317 --> 45:53.251
- Hey.
- Yo.

45:53.253 --> 45:54.485
Did you get with Lisa?

45:54.487 --> 45:55.887
Yeah.

45:55.889 --> 45:57.188
Can you handle it?

45:57.190 --> 45:58.590
For a while.

45:58.592 --> 45:59.857
I'm gonna be training,

45:59.859 --> 46:00.892
so you're gonna have to find someone.

46:03.529 --> 46:05.797
Close the door. Have a seat.

46:10.737 --> 46:12.770
How you feeling?

46:12.772 --> 46:15.607
I'm all right. How you feeling?

46:15.609 --> 46:17.008
Oh, I'm great.

46:19.879 --> 46:21.746
What's next?

46:21.748 --> 46:23.114
You're the coach.

46:23.116 --> 46:24.449
You tell me.

46:24.451 --> 46:27.585
What do you want?

46:27.587 --> 46:29.120
I want to start training.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.356
I want to heal up and fight again.

46:31.358 --> 46:32.924
Long term, what do you want?

46:35.694 --> 46:39.197
You ever think about getting
married, having a family?

46:39.199 --> 46:41.032
No.

46:41.034 --> 46:44.402
No? You're 23. How do you know?

46:44.404 --> 46:47.472
I just do.

46:47.474 --> 46:49.641
Thought about going to school?

46:49.643 --> 46:51.109
I'm training all the time.

46:51.111 --> 46:55.280
Why can't you do both?

46:55.282 --> 46:58.383
I'm not going to school. Why
are we talking about this?

46:58.385 --> 47:00.551
I want you to think about your future.

47:00.553 --> 47:03.621
What your life's gonna look
like when all this is over.

47:03.623 --> 47:05.590
Yeah.

47:05.592 --> 47:08.459
How long do you think you're gonna fight?

47:08.461 --> 47:11.763
I don't know.

47:11.765 --> 47:15.333
Stay healthy, 10, 15 years, maybe.

47:15.335 --> 47:17.769
Pfft! 10 years, you're... You're a miracle.

47:17.771 --> 47:19.871
15 years, that's... forget it.

47:21.740 --> 47:23.908
You did it.

47:23.910 --> 47:25.510
I was born to do this shit.

47:25.512 --> 47:27.111
I did it too long.

47:27.113 --> 47:29.814
You can't count on more than three.

47:29.816 --> 47:32.817
Three years, dick money,
you're broke before you're 30.

47:32.819 --> 47:36.254
Thanks for the advice.

47:36.256 --> 47:38.756
Can we talk about my next fight?

47:40.826 --> 47:42.760
You're a great athlete, Nate.

47:42.762 --> 47:44.262
Thanks.

47:48.701 --> 47:51.703
I don't know if you're a great fighter.

47:56.442 --> 47:59.110
Because of two losses?

47:59.112 --> 48:01.379
Because I know you.

48:01.381 --> 48:04.449
And the difference between
good and great is immense.

48:04.451 --> 48:06.684
It's... it's a fucking hundred miles.

48:06.686 --> 48:09.454
I could beat anybody in this gym right now.

48:09.456 --> 48:10.955
Fucking anybody in here.

48:10.957 --> 48:12.357
I'm not talking about ability.

48:12.359 --> 48:14.225
It's a mind-set.

48:14.227 --> 48:16.961
It's a mental fucking illness
that I don't see in you, son.

48:16.963 --> 48:18.196
You're not that animal.

48:18.198 --> 48:19.297
I've been injured.

48:19.299 --> 48:21.032
You're missing my...

48:21.034 --> 48:22.867
You're missing my point, Nate.

48:22.869 --> 48:24.635
Yeah, what's your fucking point?

48:24.637 --> 48:25.970
What's the point?

48:25.972 --> 48:27.739
Because right now, all I'm hearing...

48:31.543 --> 48:34.212
You don't think I can fight?

48:38.150 --> 48:40.385
I'm on the good side of this.

48:40.387 --> 48:44.756
Most guys my age are broke or dead.

48:44.758 --> 48:47.492
I want more for you. Okay?

48:47.494 --> 48:49.494
Yeah, you could fight.

48:49.496 --> 48:52.063
You don't have to.

48:52.065 --> 48:53.798
Do better than me.

48:57.836 --> 48:59.103
Yeah.

49:03.575 --> 49:05.443
I'm gonna go train now.

49:14.853 --> 49:17.688
I tell my guys to identify their fear.

49:17.690 --> 49:20.191
Seek it out. Run straight through it.

49:20.193 --> 49:22.427
Take its power, make it your own.

49:22.429 --> 49:25.296
And then move on. Direct confrontation.

49:25.298 --> 49:26.564
It's the only way to survive.

49:26.566 --> 49:28.199
Fear's a killer.

49:28.201 --> 49:30.968
I used to hate being
backstage before the walkout.

49:30.970 --> 49:32.870
That's when the nerves would hit.

49:32.872 --> 49:35.540
That's 'cause you think
you have a choice, Kenny.

49:35.542 --> 49:38.376
When that cage door closes
and that bolt drops,

49:38.378 --> 49:39.777
life gets real simple.

49:39.779 --> 49:43.214
You got to fight.

49:43.216 --> 49:46.317
Now, you may not win.
You may take a beating.

49:46.319 --> 49:48.085
But that's just pain, right?

49:48.087 --> 49:51.222
The fear is gone. You
have clarity of purpose.

49:51.224 --> 49:52.957
That's a beautiful thing.

49:52.959 --> 49:56.894
So, you've won as a fighter,
you've won as a coach.

49:56.896 --> 49:58.496
Which is more satisfying to you?

49:58.498 --> 50:00.565
Oh, man. Fighting. You kidding me?

50:00.567 --> 50:01.999
Really? Not even close.

50:02.001 --> 50:03.434
Even after all these years?

50:03.436 --> 50:04.802
Yeah.

50:04.804 --> 50:06.604
I mean, you're talking the difference

50:06.606 --> 50:09.307
between experience and observation, right?

50:09.309 --> 50:11.142
You got guys out there like Jackson.

50:11.144 --> 50:13.444
He loves the puzzle and
the theory of it, right?

50:13.446 --> 50:14.946
Always looking for new ways.

50:14.948 --> 50:16.647
That's a demon that he's chasing.

50:16.649 --> 50:18.950
And I respect that.

50:18.952 --> 50:23.287
Me, I want to be in the pocket, man.

50:23.289 --> 50:26.924
'Cause when you're fighting,
you're on a higher plane.

50:26.926 --> 50:30.194
And that's when instinct
and flow takes over.

50:30.196 --> 50:34.832
You overcome the panic of anxiety.

50:34.834 --> 50:38.870
And your mind goes really, really quiet.

50:38.872 --> 50:41.606
Not still.

50:41.608 --> 50:45.209
Just quiet.

50:45.211 --> 50:47.778
I chase that every fucking day.
