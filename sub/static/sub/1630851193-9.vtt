and what it means.
Please!

10:36.244 --> 10:38.420
[groans] Out you go.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.770
I don't mess with groupies.

10:40.814 --> 10:43.207
Wait, no, uh, people will die

10:43.251 --> 10:44.731
if you don't give me
an explanation

10:44.774 --> 10:46.341
of your mysterious masterpiece.

10:46.384 --> 10:50.040
Listen, uh...
it's literary terrorists!

10:50.084 --> 10:52.086
Not those.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.784
They got to Pynchon.
They got to Salinger.

10:54.828 --> 10:57.613
So far, I've been lucky.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.528
Right. Exactly. Yes.

10:59.571 --> 11:01.225
So those same terrorists
that fucked

11:01.269 --> 11:02.966
those pals that
you just mentioned,

11:03.010 --> 11:04.968
they're holding
my family captive.

11:05.012 --> 11:07.101
-No.
-Yes. They made me

11:07.144 --> 11:08.493
get a meeting with you, sir,

11:08.537 --> 11:10.757
-the ventilated...
-Venerated.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.367
...author of The Killing Bush.

11:12.410 --> 11:13.760
If you tell me
what the book means,

11:13.803 --> 11:15.936
then I-I can go free my family.

11:15.979 --> 11:19.330
Hmm. I will help you.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.115
-But in person.
-[gasps]

11:21.158 --> 11:23.291
I demand to be taken
to those terrorists

11:23.334 --> 11:25.162
so that I can do
the honorable thing:

11:25.206 --> 11:28.600
trade myself and my secret
of The Killing Bush

11:28.644 --> 11:30.559
for your family.

11:30.602 --> 11:33.040
Yes, yes, yes.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.130
Okay, great, but--
smallest caveat--

11:36.173 --> 11:39.350
give me an hour, and then
come by my house, okay?

11:43.877 --> 11:45.313
We have the whole milk

11:45.356 --> 11:48.316
with the hint
of Bermuda grass and dandelion.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.883
-Enjoy.
-Brenna...

11:49.926 --> 11:53.408
I know you're not doing
these food promises to Mama.

11:53.451 --> 11:58.587
And I know you're only here
to ruin this for me and Daddie.

11:58.630 --> 12:00.502
Drink it, Bren.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.898
See, Debbie? She...

12:04.941 --> 12:07.901
[gags]

12:07.944 --> 12:10.033
-[whimpering]
-[server gasps]

12:10.077 --> 12:13.471
Fine!
It's true, all right?

12:13.515 --> 12:16.910
I've always faked eating all of
Mama's deathbed requests.

12:16.953 --> 12:18.694
It's just too much.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.784
I want to stay thin,
like Mama.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.178
I knew it! [scoffs]

12:24.221 --> 12:27.355
You have always tried to be
just like Mama

12:27.398 --> 12:29.879
so you could steal Daddie
away from me.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.969
I never really even had
Mama's love, Brenna.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.971
I only had Daddie's,
and then you started being

12:35.015 --> 12:36.712
just like Mama after she died,

12:36.756 --> 12:40.760
so then you got both their love,
and I got nothing!

12:42.065 --> 12:45.547
You stole Daddie,
and I hate you for it!

12:45.590 --> 12:47.201
[sobbing]

12:47.984 --> 12:49.638
[all gasp]

12:51.596 --> 12:54.382
If that is how
you planned it to go,

12:54.425 --> 12:57.080
then you are a horrible person.

13:05.175 --> 13:07.395
Oh, my God,
here she comes, finally.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.962
Remember, show submissiveness.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.615
Let Tonya feel superior.

13:10.659 --> 13:13.836
[raspy voice]: Just be nice
and cool and honest.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.622
All right, what's all this
about, shithead?

13:17.666 --> 13:21.583
Well, Tonya, I need you
to pretend to be

13:21.626 --> 13:23.715
a literary terrorist that's
holding my family hostage

13:23.759 --> 13:26.370
so that an elderly
nut-bar author

13:26.414 --> 13:28.416
can mutter to you his secret
motives and meanings

13:28.459 --> 13:30.897
behind his insane book
so that you can then

13:30.940 --> 13:34.422
tell me what he said
so that I can then tell

13:34.465 --> 13:37.033
a very cool critic so that
I can look smart,

13:37.077 --> 13:38.339
and he will be my friend,

13:38.382 --> 13:40.689
along with the other
snobby people

13:40.732 --> 13:42.125
that hang around with Gbenge,

13:42.169 --> 13:44.911
who is the real person
I'm trying to impress

13:44.954 --> 13:47.043
because he's smart and cool.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.134
[laughing]

13:56.052 --> 13:59.621
Oh, ho, ho, goddamn.

13:59.664 --> 14:02.537
Why should I help you
do all that?

14:02.580 --> 14:04.147
I knew you'd be a shit
about this,

14:04.191 --> 14:05.932
you sex-addicted booze hound.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.324
Let me tell you something,
Freddie.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.630
I have two advanced degrees,

14:08.673 --> 14:10.458
and I am the top vet
in this town.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.939
Am I a confident, intelligent,
sexually progressive woman?

14:12.982 --> 14:14.897
Of course. Have I dated
across the spectrum

14:14.941 --> 14:17.160
because I have no interest
in your lockdown married life?

14:17.204 --> 14:18.727
Sure.
Am I also a mess?

14:18.770 --> 14:19.771
Abso-fucking-lutely.

14:19.815 --> 14:23.906
But stop reducing me
to my parts.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.387
Okay, deal.
I'll do that,

14:26.430 --> 14:27.518
and I won't get in the way

14:27.562 --> 14:29.216
of you and Debbie's friend-shit.
Ship!

14:30.782 --> 14:32.915
[laughter]

14:32.959 --> 14:34.743
Hi.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.266
Hey there, Daddie Dan.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.834
-Here we go, hey.
-Oh, my gosh.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.228
It's noon. We gotta start.

14:41.271 --> 14:44.884
Just like my sister,
your Mama, used to like.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.367
A little here. A little...

14:50.411 --> 14:52.892
-Okay, looks good.
-Freddie,

14:52.935 --> 14:55.198
-Hobby looks dry, man.
-[Ollie moans]

14:55.242 --> 14:57.548
Okay, okay, here he comes.
All right, remember

14:57.592 --> 14:58.898
anything the author says.

15:02.205 --> 15:03.946
I demand you let these people go

15:03.990 --> 15:07.689
in trade for me
and my secrets. Deal?

15:07.732 --> 15:10.083
Oh, tough guy, huh?

15:10.126 --> 15:11.736
We'll see about that

15:11.780 --> 15:14.348
-after I torture the shit...
-Uh, pardon me.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.480
Uh, terrorist, you said
you only wanted

15:16.524 --> 15:19.570
the secret meaning
of The Killing Bush,right?

15:19.614 --> 15:21.616
Oh, yes, that's right.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.834
That's why I did all this.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.706
Okay, so tell me now.

15:24.749 --> 15:28.405
I will, but in private.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.808
Now we'd love to hear
any testimonials

15:39.851 --> 15:42.593
for the wonderful--
pardon me for tearing up--

15:42.637 --> 15:46.032
the perfect, the sweetest
of all sweeteners,

15:46.075 --> 15:48.164
Mama McCallister.

15:48.208 --> 15:51.515
Your mama was a warm,
regal, confident woman

15:51.559 --> 15:56.042
who possessed a rare,
reassuring calm. A goddess.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.088
Yes, indeed.
She was a saint of a mama.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.090
Your mama spoke her mind,

16:01.134 --> 16:04.311
but she was kind and sweet;
a miracle.

16:04.354 --> 16:07.662
Mama knew exactly what to say
and what to do

16:07.705 --> 16:09.577
to get what she wanted.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.057
Like you, Brenna.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.015
[others crying]

16:13.059 --> 16:15.713
You know, I, uh...

16:15.757 --> 16:18.760
I guess I do miss Mama.

16:18.803 --> 16:23.069
I recall her being
self-absorbed, demanding,

16:23.112 --> 16:25.071
and not at all warm and fuzzy.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.898
[all gasp]

16:26.942 --> 16:28.378
Whoa, whoa, it takes dedication

16:28.422 --> 16:30.032
to be a beauty queen.
You gotta...

16:30.076 --> 16:32.513
I'm sorry. I know you all
don't agree,

16:32.556 --> 16:36.821
but that's my truth,
and I had to say it.

16:36.865 --> 16:40.086
She made fun of me all the time.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.522
She was feared by all of us

16:41.565 --> 16:44.264
because she was
the alpha female, and mean.

16:44.307 --> 16:47.354
She was a bitch.
Competitive. Narcissistic.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.659
Driven!

16:48.703 --> 16:50.183
Thank you, thank you,
Aunt Sadness.

16:50.226 --> 16:55.101
Your mama used to say,
"Turn heads, not stomachs."

16:55.144 --> 16:57.538
She made us all eat
fattening stuff in front of her

16:57.581 --> 16:58.582
so she could watch.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.671
She only ate carrots.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.848
Yes. Yes!
Mom did do that.

17:03.892 --> 17:06.851
-[laughter]
-[others agreeing]

17:06.895 --> 17:09.245
Wow. It wasn't just me?

17:09.289 --> 17:11.421
You all had the same
experiences

17:11.465 --> 17:12.727
with Mama that I did?

17:12.770 --> 17:15.164
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.471
Oh, I...

17:17.514 --> 17:20.039
I guess I'm not
as much of an outsider

17:20.082 --> 17:22.171
to this family as I thought.

17:22.215 --> 17:25.174
And I guess I have
a lot more in common with Mama

17:25.218 --> 17:28.917
than I'd care to admit.
Oof. Damn.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.962
[clears throat]
Okay, here it comes.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.921
Um... Shit!

17:32.964 --> 17:36.620
Bren, Daddie, I see now
that this whole thing

17:36.664 --> 17:38.187
is not about Mama.

17:38.231 --> 17:41.016
Nope. It's about us, guys.

17:41.060 --> 17:45.629
She knew it would bring us
and keep us together.

17:45.673 --> 17:49.894
So get a glass. Get one! Okay.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.027
-To Mama!
-To Mama.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.812
-Cheers.
-Long live Mama.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.250
Hold still.

17:57.293 --> 18:00.079
-Drink it. Drink it!
-No!

18:00.122 --> 18:02.342
I'm smarter undiluted.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.213
[gasps]
Did he explain the book?

18:04.257 --> 18:06.955
Yeah. He was just
a dirty old man.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.784
I mean, he just kept describing

18:09.827 --> 18:11.177
what he thought
my bush looked like.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.614
He kept saying how he wanted
to be buried in it,

18:13.657 --> 18:16.878
-like a pharaoh in a pyramid.
-Ugh.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.532
He muttered that shit
over and over,

18:18.575 --> 18:19.837
saying that that's
the secret truth

18:19.881 --> 18:20.969
he wanted to get across
in the book.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.492
Whoa, let me get this straight.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.755
Were you showing him
your privates?

18:24.799 --> 18:29.456
No. But he did die
saying, "Pussy."

18:29.499 --> 18:31.414
What?! He died?!

18:31.458 --> 18:32.546
-[panting]
-[chuckles]

18:32.589 --> 18:34.156
It's so fun to watch
your dad sweat.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.594
Right, Hobby? Tosh.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.295
Sorry for...

18:42.338 --> 18:45.776
maybe ruining your trip.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.214
No, I apologize.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.432
After Mama died,

18:49.476 --> 18:51.739
I did gravitate to Brenna,

18:51.782 --> 18:55.046
because she reminded me
so much of Mama.

18:55.090 --> 18:58.572
And as you grew, you became
more and more like me,

18:58.615 --> 19:02.706
-which I didn't like.
-[sighs]

19:02.750 --> 19:04.752
You didn't like me.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.797
No, silly, I love you.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.931
I didn't want to be
reminded of me.

19:09.974 --> 19:14.588
I felt bad for moving on
with my life with other women.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.243
So I-I kept it from y'all,
and I just...

19:17.286 --> 19:20.463
Yeah, yeah, I get that, Daddie.

19:20.507 --> 19:23.379
I love you, too.
It's okay.

19:23.423 --> 19:26.730
So come on, tell me.
What about this new woman?

19:26.774 --> 19:30.778
Oh. We met in the john.
She's a cougar.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.433
She's got melons,
and we both like to camp.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.610
Well, text her some gross shit.

19:36.653 --> 19:38.220
I'm gonna go make up
with Brenna.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.135
BRENNA:
Why? What's the matter?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.529
Still got sand in your satchel?

19:42.572 --> 19:45.184
Brenna, I went too far
with what I said at the dairy.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.883
And I didn't even mean
what I said. I'm sorry.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.059
You did mean some of it.

19:51.102 --> 19:53.844
I say we share the big old fart.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.324
Right?

19:55.368 --> 19:57.718
[gasps]
You know what?

19:57.761 --> 19:59.981
I see now that Mama had us eat

20:00.024 --> 20:01.548
because she wouldn't.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.550
She was always trying
to stay fit

20:03.593 --> 20:04.899
for her beauty contests,

20:04.942 --> 20:06.205
which meant more to her
than anything.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.598
Even us, sometimes.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.861
And she was competitive with us.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.689
So she was trying
to keep us fat,

20:12.733 --> 20:14.082
even after she was dead.

20:14.125 --> 20:18.391
Wow. You might actually
be right.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.349
I guess you can't ever
really know

20:20.393 --> 20:23.222
why people do what they do.
Right?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.093
Yeah, but-- huh?--

20:25.136 --> 20:28.444
we can get closer,
like we did on this trip.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.054
You can't shortcut a hard book,

20:30.098 --> 20:31.708
and you can't shortcut
hard relationships.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.275
[blows raspberry]

20:33.319 --> 20:35.712
It's like we were all
each other's Killing Bush.

20:35.756 --> 20:38.411
-What?
-What?

20:41.979 --> 20:44.068
Another dead body at this house?

20:44.112 --> 20:46.636
Oh, my God,
it's Roderick Downship.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.725
Frederick, you knew him?

20:48.769 --> 20:50.292
Oh, of course Freddie knew him.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.120
Roderick was his English tutor.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.991
They were planning
to surprise you.

20:54.035 --> 20:56.472
Ah, yes, yes, that's true,
but alas,

20:56.516 --> 20:59.258
Father Time struck again,
you know. [chuckles]

20:59.301 --> 21:01.738
The greatest author
of the greatest book just died

21:01.782 --> 21:03.131
in this very house.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.654
And I was his greatest critic.

21:04.698 --> 21:07.744
I demand to know
the secret of the book.

21:07.788 --> 21:11.182
Well, The Killing Bush
is a metaphor

21:11.226 --> 21:13.402
for a vagina,

21:13.446 --> 21:14.664
which is the cradle of life,

21:14.708 --> 21:16.927
like the place of the birth
of civilization.

21:16.971 --> 21:20.670
Which is the Fertile Crescent
and ancient Egypt.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.325
It's like how a baby's head
is held in the cervix,

21:23.369 --> 21:26.328
formed in the cervix,
and how the head of the penis

21:26.372 --> 21:29.418
returns over and over
through the bushy

21:29.462 --> 21:31.725
vagina of life...

21:31.768 --> 21:34.205
is The Killing Bush.

21:34.249 --> 21:38.209
[crying]

21:38.253 --> 21:39.994
[laughing]

21:40.037 --> 21:44.433
I now die of enlightenment.

21:44.477 --> 21:45.869
[gurgles]

21:45.913 --> 21:49.046
Oh, shit.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.353
Yeah, I should have known
we'd need a second ambulance

21:51.397 --> 21:52.528
at the Harper House.

21:52.572 --> 21:54.443
Man, oh, man.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.532
Hey, so maybe you and I
can grab a beer

21:56.576 --> 21:57.881
and hang, you know.

21:57.925 --> 22:00.144
Yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

22:00.188 --> 22:03.147
-Wow.
-All right, I'm out.

22:03.191 --> 22:05.062
I'm Tonya.
This is the guy

22:05.106 --> 22:06.890
you wanted to impress so bad
that you had me

22:06.934 --> 22:08.501
and your kids lie for you

22:08.544 --> 22:09.893
about you having read that book?

22:09.937 --> 22:13.375
Next time you men
do a book club, call me.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.638
I did one of my dissertations
on The Killing Bush

22:15.682 --> 22:19.903
and hostile POVs towards women
in postmodern meta-fiction.

22:22.036 --> 22:26.257
Ha, that Tonya, she's--
I'm sorry.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.003
Yes! Kids! Freddie!

22:33.047 --> 22:35.397
-Yes.
-Family! Mmm.

22:35.441 --> 22:38.792
-[mumbling gibberish]
-Hey...

22:38.835 --> 22:41.055
[grunts] I missed you.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.491
Dad teamed up with Tonya,

22:42.535 --> 22:45.102
and they killed two men
while you were gone.

22:45.146 --> 22:46.930
Gotcha.
Skeletons still here?

22:46.974 --> 22:49.716
No. Got the morgue
on speed dial. Yeah.

22:49.759 --> 22:51.152
Uh-huh. Cool. Wait.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.284
Wait, wait, wait,
you partnered up with Tonya?

22:53.328 --> 22:54.285
My Tonya?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.244
We learned a lot
about each other.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.899
Okay...

22:58.942 --> 23:00.944
Okay. All right.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.773
Oh, Ollie,
you gotta hydrate, honey.

23:03.817 --> 23:04.774
Nope.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.210
Dude, you got doo-doo breath

23:06.254 --> 23:07.516
from getting too dry.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.388
What? I can't have that.

23:11.346 --> 23:14.393
[normal voice]: Oh, Mom,
you know just what to say.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.785
Oh, boy.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.221
Todd, you also have
doo-doo breath

23:17.265 --> 23:18.745
from all that coffee. Ugh.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.791
Look, I got some caffeine
patches from a truck stop.

23:21.835 --> 23:22.836
That should help wean you off.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.795
Oh, yes.

23:25.839 --> 23:29.886
And, Freddie, you get...

23:29.930 --> 23:31.714
[moans]

23:31.758 --> 23:33.847
...in that kitchen, please,
and fix me something to eat.

23:33.890 --> 23:35.152
I'm dying.

23:35.196 --> 23:38.199
Sounds great, babe.
Back to normal.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.245
♪

23:47.338 --> 23:50.429
Good. I'm still
the beauty of the family.

24:29.903 --> 24:30.469
Chirp.
