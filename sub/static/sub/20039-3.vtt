WEBVTT

00:07.167 --> 00:08.667
(sighs)

00:08.733 --> 00:09.667
There he is.
Hey.

00:09.733 --> 00:10.733
Morning, jefe.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.000
Damn, where's
the coffee, dude?

00:12.067 --> 00:13.700
I got my meeting
for "Valleys" today.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.033
Yo, here, take mine.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.467
I make this breakfast
hack that is woke.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.700
I take the leftover milk
from my Froot Loops,

00:18.767 --> 00:20.067
and pour it in there.

00:20.133 --> 00:22.233
Sweet and fruity.
Uh, I'll get diabetes later.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.333
I'll get some on the way.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.500
Hey, come on,
Manolo, let's go.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.267
I can't drive you today, jefe.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.200
It's my first day of
adult education class.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.533
Remember, I gotta get my GED
or I violate my parole.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.900
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Well, I'll drive myself.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.567
Can I have a ride?
Can you have a ride?

00:34.633 --> 00:36.633
Yeah, bring Hector with you.
Maybe you'll
both learn something.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.533
Man, I already
graduated high school.
Well, I'm busy, dude,

00:38.600 --> 00:40.200
so I'm not leaving you
in the house all by yourself.

00:40.267 --> 00:41.800
But you don't have
to worry about me, George.

00:41.867 --> 00:44.000
In prison, I learned how to keep
myself busy and out of trouble.

00:44.067 --> 00:46.467
(sighs)
All right.

00:46.533 --> 00:47.967
Good morning.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.400
Oh, man, this, like, the fifth
night you spent here this week.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.233
I just love hanging
out with you, George.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.467
I didn't know
you were here.

00:53.533 --> 00:55.367
Maronzio, happy birthday.
Thanks, bud.

00:55.433 --> 00:57.467
Oh, yeah, hey, uh,
Maronzio, happy birthday.

00:57.533 --> 00:59.000
I was gonna...

00:59.067 --> 01:00.567
We were gonna say it together,
but he jumped, he jumped--

01:00.633 --> 01:01.967
(whispering)
Did you get him a gift?

01:02.067 --> 01:03.533
Dammit, George,
there's no more coffee.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.067
You need get
a second coffeemaker.

01:05.067 --> 01:06.267
It's just practical.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.067
No, no, Hector made
you some coffee.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.400
It's good.

01:09.467 --> 01:10.467
(sipping)

01:10.533 --> 01:12.100
(laughing)
(Hector)
It's good.

01:12.167 --> 01:15.700
That's cereal milk.
How you celebrating
your birthday?

01:15.767 --> 01:17.400
Well, you know, birthday
is just another day.

01:17.467 --> 01:18.667
I'm just gonna
focus on my podcast.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.267
You have a podcast?
What's it about?

01:20.333 --> 01:22.933
Well, it took me long and
hard to land on something,

01:23.067 --> 01:24.067
but I think I got
something good.

01:24.133 --> 01:25.500
I'm gonna interview
famous rappers.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.767
There's only about five
or 10,000 podcasts, why not?

01:27.833 --> 01:30.100
(snickering)
It's sounds great,
I'll listen to it.

01:30.167 --> 01:31.867
And I appreciate that.
I rap.

01:31.933 --> 01:36.067
(rapping in Spanish)

01:36.100 --> 01:37.100
You should interview me.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.433
I don't even know
what you said.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.067
Besides, you're not famous.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.467
Look, you know
Lil Yachty, right?

01:41.533 --> 01:42.500
Yeah, I hang out
with his pops.

01:42.567 --> 01:44.267
Make a phone call for me?
No.

01:44.333 --> 01:45.567
Come on, chorizo ice.

01:45.633 --> 01:47.433
Let's go.
Grab your Selena lunch box.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.967
All right, guys, come on.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.567
Bye, man,
good luck.

01:50.633 --> 01:53.700
(sighs)

01:53.767 --> 01:55.800
Why didn't you tell me it was
Maronzio's birthday, man?

01:55.867 --> 01:57.067
Why do I pay you for?

01:57.100 --> 01:58.367
I'm your driver.

01:58.433 --> 01:59.833
And you're doing
a bang-up job, too.

01:59.900 --> 02:00.900
Now I gotta get him a gift.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.100
Well, he likes everything.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.667
Oh.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.467
**

02:11.633 --> 02:12.833
(shifts gears)

02:12.900 --> 02:15.333
It's been a long time
since I've been in school.

02:15.400 --> 02:16.800
It hasn't changed.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.067
I don't think
they've put any paint

02:18.067 --> 02:19.067
since they built this place.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.200
What if I don't do good?
Do good?

02:21.267 --> 02:24.400
Okay, listen, you might
wanna spend some extra time
in English class.

02:24.467 --> 02:26.100
I'm nervous, jefe.

02:26.167 --> 02:28.800
Okay, listen, it's natural that
you're gonna be nervous, okay?

02:28.867 --> 02:30.900
Just don't fall asleep
like you do when you drive me.

02:30.967 --> 02:34.467
Oh, and if you're still nervous
at recess, check out your lunch.

02:34.533 --> 02:36.133
I put a little
40 ounce in there,

02:36.200 --> 02:38.300
take the edge off,
all right.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.300
Good looking out,
jefe, thank you.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.633
Of course,
now go in there.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.233
You're gonna be tardy
on your first day.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.800
Go learn something.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.833
(phone ringing)

02:53.067 --> 02:54.633
Oh, good, George,
you're here, hi.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.067
Hi, we're here on time for
the human resources meeting.
Thank you.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.800
Is this what we come down to?
Like, we're having a meeting

02:59.867 --> 03:01.567
to talk about what we're gonna
talk about later in the meeting?

03:01.633 --> 03:03.400
It's not what we're
going to talk about.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.733
It's how we're going
to talk about it with Coco.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.667
Come on, Olly,
Coco's transgender.

03:07.733 --> 03:10.100
She's not holding
hostages at gunpoint.

03:10.167 --> 03:11.567
Not far off.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.467
ABC will only greenlight
"Valleys" if Coco commits to it.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.167
I know, you keep saying.

03:15.233 --> 03:16.267
Hey, I probably should get
Maronzio a gift

03:16.333 --> 03:17.767
'cause it's his birthday,

03:17.833 --> 03:19.433
since I kind of screwed him
out of the whole Vegas thing?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.267
Yes, gifts are a good idea.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.100
Maybe sky diving lessons.

03:23.167 --> 03:24.700
Or an edible bouquet.

03:24.767 --> 03:27.600
Or I know a guy who makes
socks with your face on them.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.067
No, I think I...

03:29.067 --> 03:30.433
just figured out
the perfect gift.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.767
We'll stop at a drugstore
and get him a card.

03:32.833 --> 03:36.233
Yeah, oh, I'm sure he'll
really appreciate the effort.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.400
Do you want me
to sign it for you?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.300
Yeah, but, don't
use the glitter ink

03:39.367 --> 03:41.367
'cause it looks like
I didn't really sign it.

03:41.433 --> 03:42.367
Mm, you didn't.

03:42.433 --> 03:45.067
(clears throat)

03:45.133 --> 03:48.067
Columbus's voyage was in 1492.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.333
Now there were three ships.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.300
The Nina, the Pinta
and the Santa Maria.

03:52.367 --> 03:54.100
Miss Whitney?
Yes.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.167
I didn't get that last part.
Could you say it once more?

03:56.233 --> 03:59.200
Oh, my God, again?

03:59.267 --> 04:02.533
So, the second one is,
is the Pinto? Like a bean?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.533
Chico likes beans, figures.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.967
Hey! Do you see this
sign right here?

04:07.067 --> 04:08.867
This is a no bullying zone.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.667
You best respect him before
I mess you up, fatso.

04:11.733 --> 04:14.867
I'm pregnant.
I know you,
you're always pregnant.

04:14.933 --> 04:18.667
It's the Nina, the Pinta
and the Santa Maria.

04:18.733 --> 04:21.433
Hey, Chico, all the notes
are online, man come on!

04:21.500 --> 04:23.267
I read somewhere that
if you write things down,

04:23.333 --> 04:24.467
you remember 'em better.

04:24.533 --> 04:26.700
I just can't remember
where I read that.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.067
Guess I shoulda
written it down, huh?

04:28.067 --> 04:30.700
(laughing)

04:30.767 --> 04:33.333
HR has called this
meeting to discuss Coco.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.067
There are many issues
that are important

04:35.100 --> 04:37.467
to the LGBTQ community.
Whoa-whoa-whoa,
hold up, hold up.

04:37.533 --> 04:42.500
So, so LGBTQ is, uh,
lesbian, gay, bi, trans.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.400
And then the, man, the Q--
What's the Q?

04:44.467 --> 04:46.567
Queer.
How is that different?

04:46.633 --> 04:50.100
Actually, it's LGBTQ,
I-S and A-S.

04:50.167 --> 04:52.800
I-S is intersexual,
A-S is asexual.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.933
We're reserving the letters
J, R and M for further
classification.

04:56.067 --> 04:58.600
In any event, we are here to
discuss what can and cannot

04:58.667 --> 05:00.433
be said about and around Coco
with respect to Coco's...

05:01.600 --> 05:02.733
Being a transsexual.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.967
Oh, my.
Oh, my? What?

05:05.067 --> 05:06.967
I don't think we're
supposed to use that word.

05:07.067 --> 05:09.500
Legal believes the correct
term is transgender.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.200
Beautiful, transgender.

05:11.267 --> 05:12.267
But we prefer you
not use that either.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.800
Why not?
We're not sure.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.733
Oh, come on, why don't
I just say, like,

05:15.800 --> 05:19.200
"Hey, Coco, I'm George,
male, Mexican, heterosexual.

05:19.267 --> 05:20.833
What do you like
to be called?"

05:20.900 --> 05:23.767
Uh, remember, George,
you're cisgender or cis male.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.067
I think we're supposed to use
cis in there somewhere.

05:26.067 --> 05:28.200
Uh, George, HR is not
comfortable with you

05:28.267 --> 05:31.767
saying Mexican, male
or heterosexual.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.533
Which one do you
hate the most?

05:33.600 --> 05:38.200
If creative insists on going
down this path of confrontation
with Coco,

05:38.267 --> 05:40.400
legal cannot
sanction this meeting.
(clears throat) Olly?

05:40.467 --> 05:43.967
Uh, not a problem.
As executive producers,
George and I will make sure

05:44.067 --> 05:48.067
that everyone shows due
sensitivity to Coco,
mm-hmm, right, George?

05:48.100 --> 05:50.333
Right.
Yeah, that's right,
absolutely.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.333
Listen, Coco is gonna be happy
with whatever we call her.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.100
You can't say
her or she.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.067
Until Coco self-identifies.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.433
Meantime, perhaps
a gender-neutral pronoun.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.833
Ze, zy, zum, zir, zis.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.900
Oh, come on, what's,
what's happening?

06:03.967 --> 06:07.500
For now, it's best if we use
Coco's name at all times.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.833
For example, "Please take Coco

06:09.900 --> 06:12.533
to Coco's dressing room."
Any questions?

06:14.367 --> 06:16.800
(British accent)
Hello, you've reached
Olivia Smith Management.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.600
Miss Smith
is in a meeting at the moment.

06:18.667 --> 06:19.967
Please leave a message.

06:20.067 --> 06:21.667
(beep)
Hey, Olly, it's George.

06:21.733 --> 06:24.333
What's what the
Queen of England voice.

06:24.400 --> 06:25.833
Hey, so, I ended up getting
Maronzio

06:25.900 --> 06:28.600
a coffeemaker for his birthday.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.267
All right, so, if you're
thinking about getting a gift,

06:30.333 --> 06:32.800
probably stay out of the coffee
related areas, all right?

06:32.867 --> 06:34.667
I'm gonna drop it off
at his place.

06:34.733 --> 06:39.533
(with British accent)
'Allo, okay, I'll take
to you later, love.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.967
Sound like a Chihuahua
when I do that... 'allo?

06:49.600 --> 06:50.733
Good evening.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.200
Oh... 102?

06:53.267 --> 06:54.367
Yes?

06:54.433 --> 06:56.167
Ohh... is, is Maronzio here?

06:56.233 --> 06:57.900
No, just I.

06:57.967 --> 07:01.433
And my wife, Elsa and our
children, Max and Anika.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.067
Ah, you must be
friends of his.

07:03.133 --> 07:04.100
We are renters.

07:04.167 --> 07:06.400
Airbnb.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.500
Airbnb, that son of a bitch.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.900
No wonder he's been
staying at my house.

07:09.967 --> 07:11.600
Who, who is the
son of the bitch?

07:11.667 --> 07:14.733
Not the chocolate man,
we love him.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.267
Is that what you call him?
The chocolate man?

07:17.333 --> 07:19.633
Okay, tell the chocolate man
that George Lopez is onto him.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.600
He is at his birthday
party at a bar.

07:22.667 --> 07:24.900
We are too tired from
long flight to go.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.833
I'm sure you are.
Wow, he's having
a birthday party

07:26.900 --> 07:28.200
and invited people
from around the world.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.467
He's a wonderful man.
(sighs)
This guy...

07:30.533 --> 07:32.800
Oh, machine is
for Airbnb, hmm.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.867
**

07:43.667 --> 07:45.067
Are you literally
walking the yard?

07:45.133 --> 07:46.333
Yup, it's 10:00 a.m.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.133
Keeping to a schedule
keeps you out of trouble.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.167
And exercise keeps you calm.

07:50.233 --> 07:52.400
Well, just do it
in the back yard.

07:52.467 --> 07:53.900
You'll scare the gardener.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.400
(exhales)

07:55.467 --> 07:58.833
Lil Yachty, thank you so much
for doing the podcast.

07:58.900 --> 08:03.633
I'm a big fan
or should is say, "lil" fan?

08:03.700 --> 08:05.800
I love how you took
shots at Soulja Boy.

08:05.867 --> 08:07.200
And why go with
Soulja as a name?

08:07.267 --> 08:09.633
I mean, we already
had Sister Souljah.

08:09.700 --> 08:13.467
It seems like there's a deficit
in originality in rapper names.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.733
You're funny, bro.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.233
You gon' get shot,
but you're funny.

08:18.300 --> 08:19.700
I mean, like
all the littles.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.467
Lil' Boosie, Lil Wayne,
Lil Scrappy, Lil' Keke.

08:22.533 --> 08:24.667
Lil Yachty...
Well, yeah,
I like the Yachty.

08:24.733 --> 08:27.200
Very original,
no one is called "Yachty",
please keep that.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.200
Who the hell are you?
I'm Maronzio.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.533
Maronzio.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.100
Now that's a funny name.

08:33.867 --> 08:35.967
Oh, man, Yachty,
what's up, dog?

08:36.067 --> 08:37.700
George.
Excuse me for a second.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.067
Hey, Maronzio,
happy birthday.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.167
Get out of my house!
Why? What's wrong?

08:42.233 --> 08:43.967
You didn't think I was gonna
find out you were Airbnbing?

08:44.067 --> 08:46.533
This fool was staying
at my house and Airbnbing.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.567
Ay, and you had a birthday
party and didn't invite me.

08:49.633 --> 08:50.600
Out!

08:50.667 --> 08:52.867
George, I just--
Out.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.500
Uh, I'll be right back.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.467
No, you won't
be right back.
Yachty, I'll call you.

08:56.533 --> 09:00.267
No, you won't call him.
Go stay with the Swedes,
chocolate man.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.067
You hungry?

09:02.100 --> 09:04.267
Brother's gotta eat.
Come on, man.
What you doing here anyways?

09:04.333 --> 09:06.967
Man, I thought this
was your podcast.
Is that what he told you?

09:07.067 --> 09:08.800
That's what he said.
Damn.

09:09.933 --> 09:11.500
Yo, what's up, guys?

09:11.567 --> 09:13.067
Teacher seems nice, huh?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.133
Could you say that again.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.667
I wanna write it down.
(laughing)

09:15.733 --> 09:17.100
Hey, that's not cool.

09:17.167 --> 09:18.800
I'm just trying to
do my best in there.

09:18.867 --> 09:19.933
(mocking)
I'm just trying
to do my best.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.500
Your best at kissing ass.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.967
(both laughing)

09:30.400 --> 09:32.733
(can hisses)

09:36.233 --> 09:39.633
So, you know, when the network
said they were excited
about doing a show with Coco,

09:39.700 --> 09:43.633
I said, hey, I'm a big fan
of her-- of Coco's (chuckles).

09:43.700 --> 09:45.267
You know? I said
let's bring Coco in.

09:45.333 --> 09:49.800
Then see what Coco has to,
to say about Coco's one self.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.433
(nervous chuckle)

09:51.500 --> 09:54.467
So, I think that Coco,
you would be a great,

09:54.533 --> 09:55.667
a great addition to the show.

09:55.733 --> 09:58.433
Addition?

09:58.500 --> 10:01.233
As in, like,
an afterthought?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.500
Co-star.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.100
Yeah, sidekick.

10:04.167 --> 10:05.300
Mm... equals.

10:05.367 --> 10:07.933
The network is
dedicated to equality.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.433
We've been at the forefront
of LGTB...Q, IS and AS rights.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.833
Especially T.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.433
See...
(clears throat)

10:20.500 --> 10:24.167
When they called me, they said
we've got a show for Coco.

10:24.233 --> 10:27.033
It's about a private eye
and it takes place in Mexico.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.067
Oh, yeah, actually,
it takes place here,

10:29.133 --> 10:31.000
literally, uh,
here in the valley,

10:31.067 --> 10:32.433
you know, where I grew up.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.233
And it's about the people
that, uh, live there

10:34.300 --> 10:36.400
and still live there,
so, it's, uh, tragic.

10:36.467 --> 10:39.333
There's a little bit of joy.
But it's personal,
it's very gritty, very real.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.600
And very relevant.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.733
So, I thought
a show for Coco.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.433
As in Coco's show?

10:46.500 --> 10:50.767
As in what I was promised
when I signed my deal!

10:50.833 --> 10:52.267
I'm not here
to be your token.

10:52.333 --> 10:53.433
Oh, no.
No...

10:53.500 --> 10:54.733
You're like
the prize.
(crosstalk)

10:54.800 --> 10:56.833
Coco is stunning, stunning,
Gorgeous.

10:56.900 --> 10:58.733
Um, so... (chuckling)

10:58.800 --> 11:00.367
What do you think,
that you're the lead?

11:00.433 --> 11:03.800
Uh, I don't know the old media
term for it, George, but I would

11:03.867 --> 11:06.600
never have told people
that you were my sidekick.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.233
So, generous, Coco.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.733
Magnanimous is not
a strong enough word.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.433
It's, it's very big of you,
Coco, but here's the thing.

11:13.500 --> 11:19.300
The show is about a Mexican
investigator and, um...

11:19.367 --> 11:20.400
I'm the Mexican.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.767
But we would never
use the M word.

11:22.833 --> 11:26.433
Maybe Latino? Latina? Latin-Z?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.567
(Coco)
How about this?

11:27.633 --> 11:29.600
What if George
is my informant?

11:29.667 --> 11:31.767
Love it.
Perfect.

11:31.833 --> 11:34.933
No, it's not perfect
because that's not the show.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.700
But we're just blue
skying here, right?

11:36.767 --> 11:38.133
So, everything's
on the table.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.667
(Coco)
I'm glad everything
is on the table.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.167
But how about it
comes off the table

11:41.233 --> 11:43.067
and into the goddamn script?!

11:43.100 --> 11:46.300
Okay, who the hell
does Coco think Coco is?

11:46.367 --> 11:47.567
Excuse me?

11:47.633 --> 11:49.867
Okay, whatever this
show ends up being,

11:49.933 --> 11:51.400
do you really think you
have the right to tell me

11:51.467 --> 11:54.367
that I can't be the lead
in my own show?
I paid my dues.

11:54.433 --> 11:56.700
I been in this business
for over 30 years.

11:56.767 --> 11:59.433
You were on Vine
for, what, six seconds?

11:59.500 --> 12:01.067
And not-- they're not
even around anymore.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.733
That's right, I checked.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.767
Legal is not comfortable with
the tone that this meeting
is going.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.233
Of course, not.
Coco, listen.

12:07.300 --> 12:09.133
If you don't
wanna be a token,

12:09.200 --> 12:11.600
and you wanna be treated like
everyone else, pay your dues!

12:11.667 --> 12:12.867
This is a disaster.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.500
It's actionable.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.567
Legal is leaving the room.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.367
And so is Coco.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.067
But there's, you know,
chemistry between us, I think?

12:30.867 --> 12:32.500
What's wrong, mi hombre?

12:32.567 --> 12:34.267
School, it's tough, bro.

12:34.333 --> 12:35.600
Oh, you want me to
quiz you on some shit?

12:35.667 --> 12:37.067
No, it's my classmates.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.200
They keep teasing me
for trying,

12:38.267 --> 12:39.467
and this mofo keeps
calling me Chico.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.067
I just wanna
give 'em a beatdown.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.867
Ohh...
And that would be
the right thing to do.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.500
But then you would
violate your parole, man.

12:45.567 --> 12:47.500
Tsk... (exhales)
I wish Psycho Steve
was here, man.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.667
He would jack them up
real good, right?

12:49.733 --> 12:51.133
Yeah, but he got
life without parole.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.900
Hey, did you offer them
cigarettes and ramen?

12:53.967 --> 12:55.733
That don't mean
anything on the outside.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.400
That's weird.

12:57.467 --> 12:58.900
(sighs)

12:58.967 --> 13:00.933
So, what time do they serve
chow around here, man?

13:01.067 --> 13:03.067
I'm hungry.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.333
Seriously, how does somebody
who's never done anything

13:06.400 --> 13:08.533
longer than six seconds
wanna be lead of a show?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.233
I know.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.433
Did I just kill the show?
I'm gonna circle back
with Rachel.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.700
I think the network
will hear where you're
coming from on this.

13:14.767 --> 13:15.700
We'll hash it out,
don't worry.

13:15.767 --> 13:17.433
Don't worry?
Hmm.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.167
Hey, did you go to Maronzio's
birthday party last night?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.433
Um, I don't remember
what I did last night.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.933
I don't remember
what I did ten minutes ago.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.567
Who was even in that meeting?
I don't know.

13:24.633 --> 13:26.567
Olly...
Oh, hello? Sorry.

13:26.633 --> 13:27.567
Hello?
It didn't ring.

13:27.633 --> 13:28.567
Shh...

13:28.633 --> 13:29.667
So, you went to the party.

13:29.733 --> 13:30.933
Well, it wasn't
really a party.

13:31.067 --> 13:32.667
It was, like, a really
bad little gathering.

13:32.733 --> 13:33.800
Did you take a gift?

13:33.867 --> 13:36.167
It said not to.
But I always do.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.533
So, there was
an invitation.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.500
An evite,
barely an invitation.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.567
Oh, so was no gifts
and don't tell George

13:41.633 --> 13:42.667
on the invitation too?

13:42.733 --> 13:45.867
No...
it was a separate email.

13:45.933 --> 13:48.333
Which sounds worse now that
I say it out loud, yeah.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.933
Who else was there?
Ryan from the coffee place?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.767
What about Jane from
next door or the mailman?

13:55.833 --> 13:57.867
Yeah, they were there.
Oh, my God.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.567
I'm not comfortable
talking about this.

13:59.633 --> 14:01.167
Oh, you're not?

14:01.233 --> 14:03.067
Well, then you know what?
Then go to school, go on.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.833
Actually, I don't
feel good, jefe.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.733
You don't feel good.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.867
Well, feel all right to me--
Wow, are you trying to get
out of going to school?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.400
Wait a minute?
What am I doing?

14:11.467 --> 14:13.433
You don't wanna go to school?
Don't go to school.

14:23.967 --> 14:25.833
Look, George, I know
what you're thinking.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.667
Hey, listen, Maronzio,
save it, all right?
I thought we were friends.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.933
We are friends, George.
That's why I didn't
invite you to the party.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.567
Because you hate parties.
I don't like not
being invited.

14:33.633 --> 14:35.567
I was protecting you.
That's why I didn't
invite you.

14:35.633 --> 14:38.267
Unless you want me to invite you
so you can turn me down?

14:38.333 --> 14:40.167
No, no, it's not--
it's not like that.

14:40.233 --> 14:41.433
It's exactly like that,
isn't it?

14:41.500 --> 14:43.100
You wanna come to the party
and stand around

14:43.167 --> 14:45.167
with that sour look on your face
and let it be known

14:45.233 --> 14:48.067
that you hate
all the people there.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.267
Is it that obvious?

14:49.333 --> 14:50.467
Yeah.

14:50.533 --> 14:52.967
I thought I had...
a good poker face.

14:53.067 --> 14:54.700
Okay, listen, I don't,
I don't hate people.

14:54.767 --> 14:57.100
I'm uncomfortable at parties.
I like people.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.533
And it's not that
I wanted to turn you down.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.100
I didn't even wanna go.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.733
But... you know.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.300
I wanted to be invited, just so
I kind of know that you...

15:04.367 --> 15:06.267
(clears throat)
...that, you know,
you wanted me there.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.267
Look, George,
you're tough to talk to

15:08.333 --> 15:11.067
and that's why
you're misunderstood.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.900
Yeah, I probably need
to work on that.

15:12.967 --> 15:14.200
I love you, George, man.

15:14.267 --> 15:16.667
And if you want,
I'll invite you to my party.

15:16.733 --> 15:18.367
You don't even have to come.

15:18.433 --> 15:22.167
Now can I please take
my stuff back upstairs?

15:22.233 --> 15:25.167
Yeah, go ahead.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.067
You mean while your place
is being rented out?

15:27.067 --> 15:30.467
Yes, while my place
is being rented out.

15:30.533 --> 15:33.867
You know, those Swedes,
they call you the chocolate man.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.400
Oh, that's how
I get my five stars

15:35.467 --> 15:37.967
'cause I put a whole
chocolate bar on their pillow.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.533
Chocolate man.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.700
(phone beeps)

15:45.767 --> 15:47.800
Hey, Olly, it's George.

15:47.867 --> 15:50.700
Listen, I think I got...
I think I got it figured out.

15:50.767 --> 15:52.600
Can you get me back
in the room with Coco?

15:52.667 --> 15:54.333
There's something that I wanna
say to--

15:54.400 --> 15:56.067
You know, if I could just sit
down and talk--

15:56.133 --> 15:58.133
I'm trying not to say her!

16:05.733 --> 16:08.100
I wanna apologize about the last
conversation that we had.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.533
I appreciate that.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.533
Now, I realize I can be
difficult to talk to.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.200
Well...

16:13.267 --> 16:15.367
Apparently, no one knows
how to talk to me either.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.933
I guess we're both
kind of misunderstood.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.733
Yeah.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.867
I'm glad we got the chance
to get together again.

16:20.933 --> 16:22.300
And sometimes I overreact.

16:22.367 --> 16:24.600
But I think the important
thing going forward is that,

16:24.667 --> 16:26.700
is that we're
honest to each other.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.533
Okay.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.867
In all honestly, people say
that you're a dick to work with.

16:32.933 --> 16:35.067
Maybe that's true
in the past.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.567
But I'm getting,
I'm getting better at it.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.500
I'm getting better.
Can I tell you a story?

16:39.567 --> 16:41.067
I'm sorry, has this
story been vetted?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.300
He's blindsiding us.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.900
When I first started,
I got cast as a waiter.

16:44.967 --> 16:48.067
And I was so sure that they were
gonna turn me into a busboy,

16:48.133 --> 16:50.500
is that I flipped out.

16:50.567 --> 16:54.267
And I never got to do the
wardrobe or, or go do
the lines or anything.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.333
But they weren't going to make
you a busboy, were they, George?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.333
Oh, no, they were.
They were gonna
make me a busboy.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.700
But, you see, the busboy
was the more memorable part.

17:01.767 --> 17:03.833
He caught a machete
across the face.
Everybody remembered him.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.067
And I got demoted to,
like, waiter number five.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.667
Okay, this is a great story.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.833
I'm not really sure how it fits
into our meeting today, but--

17:09.900 --> 17:15.833
George understands that I came
in here fearful that
I'd be marginalized.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.067
That maybe I was just a token

17:18.133 --> 17:20.767
to make sure that
the show was relevant?

17:20.833 --> 17:22.100
Legal would
never do that.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.400
No, no. no.
You're gorgeous.
(crosstalk)

17:23.467 --> 17:26.467
Anyway, I overreacted.

17:26.533 --> 17:29.200
Strutted around
like a diva.

17:29.267 --> 17:31.500
Demanded to be a star.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.467
I... a little,
a little bit.

17:33.533 --> 17:36.367
But I, I can't speak for the
network or the note takers.

17:36.433 --> 17:37.733
But I'll say this, Coco.

17:37.800 --> 17:43.733
I think you would be a great
partner in "Valleys."

17:43.800 --> 17:45.767
Thank you, George

17:45.833 --> 17:47.967
for taking the time to talk
to me like a person.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.367
Of course.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.067
I'm all on board,
let's do this.

17:53.133 --> 17:54.800
Oh!

17:54.867 --> 17:56.800
And why don't
you two get lost?

17:56.867 --> 17:59.467
And learn what a goddamn
pronoun is because I don't

17:59.533 --> 18:01.867
put on a bra and heels
not to be called she.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.433
Your hands are so soft.
That's the estrogen.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.400
(George)
I mean, you can't be serious.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.133
I find it hard to believe

18:16.200 --> 18:17.500
that your classmates
are meaner

18:17.567 --> 18:18.600
than the people in prison.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.200
Most inmates were
very respectful.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.100
Well, you can't
let the bullies win.

18:23.167 --> 18:27.867
All right, Manolo, so go over
there and stand up for yourself.

18:27.933 --> 18:30.500
Those two right there?
Those are the ones
that are tormenting you?

18:30.567 --> 18:32.533
Yeah.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.967
All right,
you wait here.

18:35.067 --> 18:36.067
(door alert pinging)

18:36.067 --> 18:39.333
(door closes)

18:39.400 --> 18:40.700
How you guys doing?

18:40.767 --> 18:42.267
Hey, it's George Lopez!

18:42.333 --> 18:44.333
Wow,
it is George Lopez.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.433
What are you
doing here, George?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.700
Are you gonna get your GED?

18:46.767 --> 18:49.100
Oh, no, I graduated
a long time ago.

18:49.167 --> 18:52.067
Oh, well, excuse me,
Dr. Lopez.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.600
(laughing)

18:53.667 --> 18:55.333
Uh, no, I didn't
mean it like that.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.633
I'm just, you know, saying...
So, you see that SUV?

18:57.700 --> 19:00.267
See that guy in there?
He's a, he's a friend of mine.

19:00.333 --> 19:01.633
He bugs the shit out of me.
All right, well,

19:01.700 --> 19:02.900
you know, he's just
a little bit nervous.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.433
So, I'd appreciate
it if both of you

19:04.500 --> 19:06.200
would just cut him
a little bit of slack.

19:06.267 --> 19:08.500
Maybe we should
listen to Dr. Lopez.

19:08.567 --> 19:11.933
(laughing)
He was, he was very
big in the '90s.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.900
(laughing)
Ha-ha-ha, I've been big
since the '90s.

19:13.967 --> 19:15.833
Yeah, right. (laughing)

19:15.900 --> 19:17.433
Just so you know,
I'm starting a new show,

19:17.500 --> 19:20.733
very relevant with
a transgender sidekick.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
(laughing)

19:21.867 --> 19:23.233
Yeah, that'll see
the light of day.

19:23.300 --> 19:25.333
Yeah, I better set my TIVO
now so we don't miss it.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.800
(laughing)

19:26.867 --> 19:28.267
That's not
very nice, come on.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.200
Crybaby say what?
What?

19:30.267 --> 19:31.233
Huh?
Huh?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.933
What?

19:33.067 --> 19:34.533
You guys are mean.
Aw...

19:34.600 --> 19:35.433
He's sad.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.900
Oh, there goes the hoodie.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.933
Bye, Georgita.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.500
(door alert pinging)

19:39.567 --> 19:40.667
(grunts)

19:40.733 --> 19:43.167
You straightened
'em out, jefe?

19:43.233 --> 19:45.533
Yeah, put 'em
in their place.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.633
Wow, man, you know what?
You don't look good, dude.

19:47.700 --> 19:50.667
You feel hot.
Maybe you should stay home
from school today.

19:50.733 --> 19:54.167
You look peaked.

19:54.233 --> 19:57.967
(engine starting)

20:03.067 --> 20:04.633
* Yeah, yeah *

20:04.700 --> 20:07.067
* That's right
come on, come on, come on *

20:07.133 --> 20:09.233
* Uh
yeah, yeah *

20:09.300 --> 20:11.233
* Come on, come on **

20:11.300 --> 20:14.967
**
