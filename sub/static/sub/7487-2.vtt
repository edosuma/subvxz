I was trying to help you,
but I don't know why I bothered.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.339
We were never
a normal couple.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.641
You're always gonna be the guy
who pulled my teeth out.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.744
Because you couldn't mind
your own business.

22:26.746 --> 22:29.647
You could never mind
your own business, quinn.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.882
And if I had
to do it again

22:31.884 --> 22:34.852
To teach you
that one very valuable lesson,

22:34.854 --> 22:36.087
I would.

Lisa, why don't you
open this door

22:50.002 --> 22:51.769
So we can all have
a conversation?

22:51.771 --> 22:53.637
Lisa:
I'm not talking to him!
Lisa.

22:53.639 --> 22:56.407
Don't bother. Just
put me on the next

22:56.409 --> 22:57.641
James,
we're all just

22:57.643 --> 22:59.076
Gonna
take a minute here.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.812
I'm serious. Screw her
and screw gun control.

23:06.151 --> 23:08.686
What the hell
happened in there?
Ask huck.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.888
Maybe he'll sing you
a song about it.

23:16.828 --> 23:18.963
Huck, what's going on
with you and quinn?
Nothing.

23:18.965 --> 23:23.868
Do you want to tell me,
or am I gonna have to tell you?

23:26.571 --> 23:28.672
It was only --

23:28.674 --> 23:30.574
It was only
a couple of times.

a couple million in bribes

Tucked under the venison
in your garage freezer.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.470
This is blackmail.

as winning.

himself to be highly qualified,

Tonight, the president heads to
the capitol building

Will be an historic

25:22.288 --> 25:24.588
Of democratic attorney general

The elliots won't be attending

When the networks do

25:48.548 --> 25:50.981
There will be no b-roll

over the evil of guns.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.266
As president
of these United States

26:09.268 --> 26:11.201
Is about to be derailed

Because his wife won't stop

26:13.940 --> 26:15.639
To put on a cocktail dress.

Our enemies are sharpening
their long knives

26:19.679 --> 26:21.345
For the rapidly
approaching moment

26:21.347 --> 26:23.981
When it becomes politically
acceptable to point out

26:23.983 --> 26:26.717
That maybe, just maybe,
the president's home life

26:26.719 --> 26:28.852
Has begun to affect
his decision-making.

Everything I've devoted
far more of my soul to

the advance

Sell the house,
take the loss.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.656
But I will spin this
for you.

I will make sure that,
when it's over,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.826
Off of individual speaking
engagements.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.795

Both of your sides.

Unless you're only
staying together for the fame,

or from cyrus

28:29.942 --> 28:31.809
And go to

I'm not interested in whatever
it is you came here to say,

28:48.260 --> 28:49.860
I don't have children,

So you may think it's horrible
for me to say that,

28:51.864 --> 28:53.497
And maybe it is,
but it's also a fact

28:53.499 --> 28:55.132
That of all
the millions of americans

Who will be watching

of people out there

Just like yours.

Flipping through trash
and eating potato chips.

They got
three days to grieve --

29:07.947 --> 29:09.313
Three weeks
if they were lucky --

29:09.315 --> 29:10.781
Or they would
lose their jobs.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.851
And make no mistake,
mrs. Grant, you have a job.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.886
You're the first lady
of the United States,

29:15.888 --> 29:17.855
And it might not pay,
but it is a job.

to replace her dead husband

You can put on a dress
and stand in your private box

And show all the people
in our nation

29:33.506 --> 29:36.373
Who share the horrible burden
of losing a child with you

29:36.375 --> 29:38.842
That the first family
may be devastated,

29:38.844 --> 29:41.145
But it has not forgotten
the american people

29:41.147 --> 29:43.781

that you're okay,

it's the truth.

For the teleprompter.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.424
Got them right here.

No.
Wait just a second.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.595
Can ms. Pope and I
have the room?

31:04.597 --> 31:06.029
That is not necessary.

31:06.031 --> 31:07.464
Can ms. Pope and I
have the room?

31:18.343 --> 31:20.310
That was not a good idea.

what you think.

Before I go out there
and talk to the country,

31:28.988 --> 31:30.621

what you think.

31:30.623 --> 31:32.289
No.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.928
Don't you think you owe me
at least this much?

31:57.682 --> 32:01.418
But not every death
is a sacrifice.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.521
Not every death has meaning.

32:04.523 --> 32:07.291
Just ask lisa elliot,

Who scooped up a first grader
named joelle brandt

32:10.195 --> 32:11.628
And carried her to safety,

Only to watch her die

From one of the 102 rounds
unloaded at red hawk elementary.

32:31.649 --> 32:34.985
I wasn't planning on
talking about this tonight.

32:34.987 --> 32:36.453
It's fine.

32:36.455 --> 32:37.988
I know you.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.990
"it's fine"
never means it's fine.

It's not.

32:53.172 --> 32:57.307
It's not, um --

32:57.309 --> 32:59.343
It's not the speech
on my teleprompter.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.610
So tell me
how to fix it.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.346
And I can tell you
that right about now

33:02.348 --> 33:04.681
There are any number of staffers
having heart attacks,

33:06.218 --> 33:07.684

33:07.686 --> 33:10.420
No one is going to care about
james and lisa elliot

If they're too busy wondering
about fitz and mellie grant.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.392
She's still grieving.

33:15.394 --> 33:17.527
The world knows
she's still grieving.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.463
So be honest.

33:19.465 --> 33:23.400
But here's the truth.

33:23.402 --> 33:30.340
My family and I have been
through something unspeakable.

33:30.342 --> 33:33.377
Something that no parent --
no human being --

33:33.379 --> 33:35.545
Should ever have to experience.

33:39.784 --> 33:43.487

wife, mellie,

our nation tonight.

[ cheers and applause ]

34:18.289 --> 34:19.489
I was gonna wear blue,

34:19.491 --> 34:21.725
But I heard
the elliots are wearing blue,

34:21.727 --> 34:25.328
So I decided to go with red.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.816
My son jerry's death...

34:45.818 --> 34:49.219
Was a horrible fluke.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.721
But it was just that --
a fluke.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.423
An accident.
