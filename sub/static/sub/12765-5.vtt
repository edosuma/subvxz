00:00.180 --> 00:02.040
Previously on Kyle XY...

00:02.040 --> 00:05.980
You are our greatest achievement and we want to have a relationship with you.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.360
A relationship to do what?

00:07.360 --> 00:08.800
Come see what we're about.

00:08.800 --> 00:12.190
We are making state of the art advances in science and technology.

00:12.190 --> 00:13.230
I'm not interested.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.770
Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?

00:15.770 --> 00:16.960
Only Kyle.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.820
- Kyle?
- If you really sense that special bond between you and Kyle,

00:20.820 --> 00:23.260
-you should act on it.
-How did you know his name?

00:23.260 --> 00:24.360
I never mentioned it.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.410
There's a lot of things I know about you, Jessi.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.730
A lot more than you think.

00:28.730 --> 00:30.090
I think it's time I explained.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.930
As long as you don't rat me out to mom and dad.

00:31.930 --> 00:33.130
I won't.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.250
- Fine.
- Thank you, Jessi.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.060
I knew you couldn't keep your mouth shut.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.500
Jessi didn't have to say a word.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.500
I'm sure she was a pillar of secrecy.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.640
I thought you'd be with Andy.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.890
Her mom's extended their vacation rental.

00:43.890 --> 00:45.250
I really miss her.

00:45.250 --> 00:46.610
Listen to me.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.790
- Adam Baylin
- What? What about him?

00:49.790 --> 00:51.880
Adam died today.

00:51.880 --> 00:55.610
You may not realize it yet, but this changes everything.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.550
How's the speech?

01:07.550 --> 01:09.680
Overwritten and tedious.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.970
I doubt that.

01:10.970 --> 01:14.420
Most of the speeches at the psychology conference usually are.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.590
Thanks for coming, by the way.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.950
Thanks for inviting me.

01:18.950 --> 01:21.070
Well, I thought you could use a weekend away.

01:21.070 --> 01:23.970
And I knew Josh would love the free room service.

01:25.550 --> 01:28.110
It's nice to see you smiling.

01:28.110 --> 01:31.350
There hasn't been a lot of smile about lately, I know.

01:31.350 --> 01:33.100
You ok?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.710
I think so.

01:34.710 --> 01:37.230
It's ok if you're not.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.600
When somebody you love dies it can take a while to make sense of it all.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.190
Yeah, especially since Baylin technically died twice.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.380
Josh!

01:44.380 --> 01:45.300
Just saying.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.970
Maybe we should ride for a while in contemplative silence.

01:48.970 --> 01:50.480
Suit yourself.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.810
Let me know when we hit the hotel.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.310
I'll be the guy in the heated pool all weekend.

01:56.590 --> 01:58.620
Nicole had suggested this weekend away as a chance 

01:58.620 --> 02:01.660
to get away from everything that was on my mind.

02:01.660 --> 02:08.270
We were miles away from home and it seemed my mind had brought my problems along, uninvited.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.250
Why're you moving Adam around?

02:10.250 --> 02:13.740
We figured if Latnok couldn't find him they couldn't convince him to come back.

02:13.740 --> 02:15.670
They want me to come work with them.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.670
With Baylin gone they'll have even more reason now.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.490
I won't do it.

02:20.490 --> 02:22.860
Well, if they give you the choice.

02:22.860 --> 02:24.650
I was gonna tell Amanda everything.

02:24.650 --> 02:29.510
Kyle, you'll just be adding her to a list of people that you've already compromised.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.850
- Is that what my life is now?
- More than ever.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.470
Kyle.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.450
What's the matter?

02:34.450 --> 02:38.640
That sign we just passed, it says we're on Route 41.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.640
I must have taken the wrong road.

02:40.640 --> 02:43.330
- What's going on?
- Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.760
I knew I should have driven.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.130
Very funny, but we need to get off this road.

02:47.130 --> 02:49.260
I can turn at the next exit.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.190
Watch out!

02:57.090 --> 02:58.400
Kyle!

03:08.270 --> 03:12.180
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 5:
Life Support</font>

03:24.830 --> 03:26.980
Nicole?

03:26.980 --> 03:28.810
I... I think I'm fine.

03:28.810 --> 03:30.670
Josh?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.460
Josh!

03:32.460 --> 03:35.410
Seatbelts totally save lives.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.990
How bad is it?

03:40.960 --> 03:43.040
It's pretty bad.

03:44.770 --> 03:46.330
Do you have your phone?

03:46.330 --> 03:47.730
Yeah.

03:49.880 --> 03:51.850
I got nothing.

03:52.460 --> 03:55.650
You guys, I think I'm stuck.

03:55.650 --> 03:58.220
The dashboard on my side is caven in.

03:58.220 --> 04:00.560
Let me help you.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.390
No, no, no, stop.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.670
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.730
I just can't get out.

04:06.730 --> 04:08.830
Let me try the other side.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.750
I don't think anybody's coming in or going out this way.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.680
Hello? Are you all right?

04:22.680 --> 04:25.230
Did you hear that?

04:25.230 --> 04:27.430
- Is everybody ok?
- You sure you're ok?

04:27.430 --> 04:31.790
Oh, no, I'm fine. I can just sit here until someone comes.

04:31.790 --> 04:34.800
I don't have any choice about it, do I?

04:34.800 --> 04:39.040
It's freaking me out that nobody's answering.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.470
Hello!

04:42.670 --> 04:45.120
I'll stay with mom.

04:45.920 --> 04:48.030
We're fine.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.350
Oh, my god.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.110
I thought you guys were straight up toast.

04:51.110 --> 04:53.780
Which would have been a downer.

04:53.780 --> 04:57.240
The upside is, I have someone who can push my car out of the road,

04:57.240 --> 04:59.770
so thanks to you, I'm no longer a highway hazard.

04:59.770 --> 05:03.080
Not counting the accident I just caused, of course.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.700
By someone who can help I meant you.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.480
Come on.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.670
It'll only take a sec.

05:21.280 --> 05:24.460
Geez, Louise. Stare much?

05:24.460 --> 05:27.910
- You're pregnant.
- Holy crap. Really?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.770
I got it.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.530
God, I hope somebody comes by.

05:37.530 --> 05:40.230
No one ever drives this road.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.250
See? That only took, like

05:47.250 --> 05:49.660
27.2 seconds.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.510
But who's counting?

05:56.930 --> 05:58.520
Are you all right?

05:58.520 --> 05:59.790
It's all good.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.180
Braxton hicks.

06:01.180 --> 06:03.430
Is that your baby's name?

06:04.560 --> 06:06.940
Braxton hicks contractions.

06:06.940 --> 06:09.530
It'll pass.

06:12.130 --> 06:16.200
I think I'm gonna walk back a ways, see if I can't flag somebody down.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.420
But you're pregnant.

06:17.420 --> 06:22.260
And you're repeating yourself, so either you're a dumb little bunny, or you have a concussion.

06:22.260 --> 06:24.610
Either way, you're gonna need some help.

06:24.610 --> 06:27.880
- You should stay here.
- I'm not an invalid.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.740
- You won't see anybody for miles.
- I'm fine.

06:38.090 --> 06:39.950
What?

06:41.560 --> 06:44.120
My water just broke.

06:49.010 --> 06:51.480
You left these on top of the dryer.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.870
I thought I'd bring them to you.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.880
I just made that.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.600
With military precision.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.490
Don't want to wreck the hospital corners.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.670
You seriously don't want me sitting on your bed?

07:08.670 --> 07:11.400
I like to keep my room clean.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.800
Totally get it.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.080
Your space, your rules.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.070
Is that my shirt?

07:21.070 --> 07:23.300
You never wear it anymore.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.980
So, you just took it?

07:25.980 --> 07:27.690
You shouldn't wear this color.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.060
It looks better on me.

07:30.060 --> 07:34.680
Ok, so I can't sit on your bed but you can just raid my closet?

07:34.680 --> 07:36.910
Jessi, that is 100 percent not cool of you.

07:36.910 --> 07:38.270
That shirt is mine.

07:38.270 --> 07:39.690
Did you buy it?

07:39.690 --> 07:42.940
- No.
- Then, technically, it's not yours.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.920
Dad!

07:48.920 --> 07:50.510
Are we having this discussion?

07:50.510 --> 07:52.740
- She's inappropriate.
- She's mean to me.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.550
- I am not mean!
- You're only nice to me when you want something.

07:55.550 --> 07:58.720
- Both of you, give it a rest.
- Just keep her out of my face!

07:58.720 --> 08:01.440
I already told her it's not her color.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.110
You said you were coming right back.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.950
I was hoping to get this car started.

08:07.950 --> 08:11.390
If I had the right parts I could get you to the hospital before your baby was born.

08:11.390 --> 08:12.530
Check it, bunny.

08:12.530 --> 08:16.780
And, by the way, no offense, you're cute as a button,

08:16.780 --> 08:19.150
but I'm the reject from the Macy's parade, all right?

08:19.150 --> 08:21.140
I think I'd know if I'm actually going into labor.

08:21.140 --> 08:23.140
She's going into labor?

08:24.330 --> 08:25.510
Who's this guy?

08:25.510 --> 08:26.800
That's Josh.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.860
- And bunny over there?
- Kyle.

08:28.860 --> 08:31.050
Great. I'm Gretchen.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.830
I want you to both listen to me very carefully, all right?

08:33.830 --> 08:35.460
I'm in my 35th week.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.360
I'm not due for at least another month.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.650
But your water just broke.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.740
You can expect to give birth in as few as two hours.

08:40.740 --> 08:42.980
Or as much as a full day from now.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.130
How do you know that?

08:44.130 --> 08:46.320
He knows a lot of stuff.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.890
Ok, then.

08:47.890 --> 08:49.880
Figure out how to get us out of here in under two hours so that 

08:49.880 --> 08:53.850
I don't have to give birth in the woods like some crazy wolf mother person.

08:54.390 --> 08:57.430
Lucky for you, Kyle's an expert at wood births.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.770
I'll go talk to Nicole.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.600
And she would be?

09:01.600 --> 09:02.570
My mom.

09:02.570 --> 09:03.460
Finally.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.800
Someone who knows something about having a baby.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.730
Get her up here.

09:09.730 --> 09:12.390
I'll be right back.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.960
So, your mom's ok, right?

09:18.960 --> 09:20.460
Yeah.

09:20.460 --> 09:24.780
She's just stuck.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.680
You hungry?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.070
I've got some smoking hot cheese crackles in the car.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.740
Those things are disgusting.

09:35.580 --> 09:37.030
And I love them.

09:37.030 --> 09:40.500
Well, I took basic human biology, but as far as my own experience goes,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.630
it's basically, breathe, push, catch.

09:43.630 --> 09:45.750
What, like football?

09:46.240 --> 09:47.900
We're not gonna be able to do this.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.870
Sure, you can. You read the encyclopedia.

09:49.870 --> 09:52.840
Which gives a brief overview of the physiological process.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.030
But it doesn't tell you how to deliver a baby safely.

09:55.030 --> 09:57.490
How's she doing now?

09:57.490 --> 10:00.260
She's trying to hide it, but she's had a few contractions.

10:00.260 --> 10:03.460
About 20 minutes apart, 30 to 45 seconds each.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.300
Ok, well, it does sound like she's in labor.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.970
The contractions are just her cervix dilating so the baby can come out.

10:08.970 --> 10:11.240
We still have some time.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.200
I can go get help.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.610
No, no, you shouldn't leave her.

10:13.610 --> 10:17.670
- I'll go.
- Walk three steps without limping.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.950
Look, we may not like it, but we're just gonna have to sit tight until help comes.

10:24.950 --> 10:27.020
- Here's another thing.
- About the baby?

10:27.020 --> 10:29.630
You can't delay labor once it starts.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.520
So, if the baby comes before help does?

10:32.520 --> 10:36.850
Then Kyle will be delivering it, whether he wants to or not.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.820
Holy mother of macaroni!

10:46.070 --> 10:48.090
Wait.

10:54.090 --> 10:56.210
I feel it.

10:57.210 --> 10:59.700
A heartbeat.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.730
Really?

11:03.850 --> 11:05.530
Show me.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.970
Oh, my god.

11:17.490 --> 11:21.600
You totally distracted me.

11:21.600 --> 11:25.060
Swell job. Contraction's over.

11:26.050 --> 11:28.550
I wasn't pretending.

11:31.170 --> 11:33.140
Really?

11:34.300 --> 11:38.380
You have ultrasound hands?

11:38.890 --> 11:41.230
Any other superpowers I should know about?

11:41.230 --> 11:45.340
Because, I mean, if you could fly me to Seattle general right about now

11:47.420 --> 11:50.420
I think you could use some water.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.810
Wait, don't leave me.

11:52.810 --> 11:54.870
She freaks me out!

11:55.230 --> 11:56.280
I have an idea.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.440
I'm gonna try and reach Jessi.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.560
Don't you guys have to be in the same room for your mind mail to work?

12:01.560 --> 12:03.500
I have to try something.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.110
Make sure Gretchen's comfortable.

12:05.110 --> 12:06.700
- I'll just be a minute.
- Dude

12:06.700 --> 12:08.660
Try your cell again.

12:16.290 --> 12:20.270
When we were touching, Jessi and I could access each other's minds.

12:20.270 --> 12:23.980
We could always sense one another if we were near.

12:27.020 --> 12:32.290
But lost in the woods, miles from home, I had no idea if she would pick up what I was sending.

12:32.290 --> 12:35.460
Or if she could understand that we needed help.

12:37.830 --> 12:39.520
Father-daughter bonding?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.120
He's keeping me out of your hair.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.730
You're welcome to play, you know.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.430
Right. She probably cheats.

12:47.140 --> 12:49.390
Accident.

13:04.830 --> 13:05.820
What's happening?

13:05.820 --> 13:08.580
Sorry, I was trying to reach Jessi.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.150
- Are you ok? You...
- Oh, I'm fine.

13:10.150 --> 13:11.520
Did it work?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.510
I have no idea.

13:12.510 --> 13:13.780
Kyle, get up here!

13:13.780 --> 13:15.670
I think Gretchen needs your help now.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.850
I don't know what to do.

13:16.850 --> 13:21.340
Well, just tell her to push when she feels like it and trust her body to do most of the work.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.400
Is that all?

13:22.400 --> 13:23.760
There's nothing else I can do?

13:23.760 --> 13:28.830
All you have to do is keep her calm and focused and encouraged.

13:28.830 --> 13:30.950
Focused and encouraged.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.700
Less than two minutes since the last contraction.

13:34.700 --> 13:38.300
- The baby's coming.
- Then you'd better get to it.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.120
Josh, grab a blanket.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.650
Use a couple of bags as pillows and set it up on that hillside.

14:09.650 --> 14:12.010
- There's one in the trunk.
- We'll get you propped up.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.820
Gravity will do part of the work.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.970
Ready?

14:17.470 --> 14:19.120
Come on.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.510
Got one.

14:32.420 --> 14:33.770
I think it's coming right now.

14:33.770 --> 14:35.940
Can you see anything?

14:37.480 --> 14:40.660
If you're waiting for a handwritten invitation, it's gonna be a while.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.200
Wait.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.040
Risk of infection.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.990
Nicely done, excitable, sidekick.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.770
Ok, I'm ready.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.280
I just lost my virginity.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.650
I'm not ready for this.

14:57.650 --> 15:00.750
He's a regular Santa's little helper, huh?

15:04.540 --> 15:07.280
It's ok. Go ahead and push.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.250
Just keep pushing.

15:09.250 --> 15:10.590
Oh, I can't do this.

15:10.590 --> 15:12.630
We need help. We need serious help.

15:12.630 --> 15:15.830
Don't worry. We're gonna get it.

15:16.400 --> 15:18.210
Everything ok?

15:18.210 --> 15:19.660
Something's wrong.

15:19.660 --> 15:22.950
- What is it?
- I don't know.

15:22.950 --> 15:24.430
That's not a word.

15:24.430 --> 15:25.520
That's definitely a word.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.930
Not according to the game dictionary.

15:27.930 --> 15:30.360
How do you know that?

15:30.750 --> 15:31.960
Of course.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.010
You read it.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.920
- I'll get it.
- Uh, no. No, no, I'll get it.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.740
I need a break.

15:41.410 --> 15:43.410
Oh, look. We're out of my soda.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.080
I wonder how that happened.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.630
And yes, I bought it.

15:46.630 --> 15:48.680
Now you're just being selfish.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.770
I'm being selfish?

15:49.770 --> 15:51.960
You're the one who takes what she wants when she wants it.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.470
That's called being assertive.

15:53.470 --> 15:56.730
You are unbelievable.

15:56.730 --> 15:58.100
Have you heard from your mother?

15:58.100 --> 16:00.720
No, but I'd like to have a few words with her right now.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.490
Someone just called. Her speech is in half an hour and they haven't arrived.

16:04.490 --> 16:06.380
They were supposed to be there hours ago.

16:06.380 --> 16:07.310
I know.

16:07.310 --> 16:09.470
- Stephen.
- Have you heard anything from Kyle?

16:09.470 --> 16:11.200
I think so.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.190
Look.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.850
"Crash. Ravine.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.160
Distress."

16:23.160 --> 16:25.890
- Dad, you don't think...?
- No, we don't know anything yet.

16:25.890 --> 16:28.940
You try their cell phones. I'll try highway patrol.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.570
I can't do it!

16:36.570 --> 16:38.490
You're doing great. Just keep pushing.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.190
Just stop, ok?

16:40.190 --> 16:43.490
I'm tired of pushing and I just want this to be over.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.940
What's wrong?

16:46.940 --> 16:50.170
Gretchen, I promise I'll be right back.

16:50.170 --> 16:52.600
I'm just going to the car, ok?

16:52.600 --> 16:54.440
Ok?

16:54.780 --> 16:57.230
Bring back drugs, please.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.140
How's the baby doing?

17:08.140 --> 17:12.700
I was getting a strong heartbeat earlier but it's fading fast and the labor's not progressing.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.240
I don't know what to tell you.

17:17.550 --> 17:20.240
I could stimulate the baby with a little charge.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.650
You don't think that would be dangerous?

17:21.650 --> 17:23.770
I've done it before.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.089
What's wrong?

17:28.660 --> 17:31.170
- You're warm.
- I got banged up a little.

17:31.170 --> 17:32.390
Nicole, you're bleeding!

17:32.390 --> 17:34.700
Oh, no, no, it's not that bad.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.740
I gotta get you out of here.

17:35.740 --> 17:37.260
The baby needs you.

17:37.260 --> 17:40.970
- You need help.
- Somebody has to help that poor girl bring her baby into the world,

17:40.970 --> 17:42.690
and that person is you.

17:42.690 --> 17:44.650
Now, go!

17:44.900 --> 17:47.630
I'll be back for you as soon as I can.

17:55.760 --> 17:57.400
Go.

18:03.860 --> 18:05.280
Anything?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.760
We know that they were headed east on Interstate 90.

18:07.760 --> 18:11.260
Nicole used her credit card at a gas station about 42 miles outside of Seattle.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.980
Narrows our route options down to nine.

18:12.980 --> 18:16.940
So they either took a wrong turn or maybe they decided to take a scenic route.

18:16.940 --> 18:19.370
They wouldn't have taken a wrong turn.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.300
You're right. Maybe....

18:20.300 --> 18:23.260
it's got to be one of the scenic routes.

18:23.260 --> 18:31.170
That narrows it down to Rocky Canyon Road, Silica Heights and Elk Heights.

18:31.170 --> 18:34.420
I'll try to get highway patrol to search those roads.

18:39.110 --> 18:41.590
Officer, Stephen Trager once again.

18:41.590 --> 18:43.770
- Apparently, my family....
- Wait.

18:43.770 --> 18:45.220
It's Route 41.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.690
Hold, please.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.930
That's not one of the routes.

18:47.930 --> 18:49.520
I know but that's what it is.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.920
Are you sure?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.850
Positive.

18:53.780 --> 18:55.680
It's Route 41.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.420
Something's wrong. I know it.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.320
No. Gretchen, I need your help.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.350
Can you stay with me?

19:06.350 --> 19:07.440
Good.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.570
You're gonna have another contraction in a minute.

19:09.570 --> 19:11.760
And when it comes I need you to push.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.580
Just close your eyes and focus, ok?

19:14.580 --> 19:17.800
Just think of something happy.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.530
Smoking hot cheese crackles?

19:19.530 --> 19:20.870
Yeah, that'll work.

19:20.870 --> 19:22.180
Ok.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.620
Ok, it's coming.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.550
Cheese crackle!

19:40.550 --> 19:41.550
Push.

19:41.550 --> 19:43.650
Come on, one more.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.610
Come on, you're doing it.

19:46.610 --> 19:47.790
You're doing it!

19:47.790 --> 19:48.850
You're doing it.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.060
Keep pushing.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.720
Gretchen.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.030
It's a boy.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.260
I'm gonna name him "dumb little bunny" after you.

20:16.260 --> 20:18.110
You will?

20:19.880 --> 20:21.930
Absolutely.

20:25.240 --> 20:26.680
Keep screaming, little buddy.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.080
Maybe somebody will finally hear us out here.

20:29.080 --> 20:36.100
I promise you, I'm gonna try and be, like, the most rad mother ever, ok?

20:36.100 --> 20:37.510
It's ok.

20:39.680 --> 20:42.130
- I'll go tell mom.
- No, stay here.

20:42.130 --> 20:45.060
- But I want...
- Josh, stay here.

20:49.950 --> 20:51.410
I hope he has an inny.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.400
Outy belly buttons are just weird.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.790
Just be glad he has one.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.940
Nicole!

21:07.020 --> 21:08.940
Nicole!

22:29.710 --> 22:32.050
What's he saying? Is it good or bad?

22:32.050 --> 22:35.290
Maybe if you shut up he could hear.

22:35.900 --> 22:41.030
Your wife has...internal injuries.

22:41.030 --> 22:43.020
Her organs are in distress.

22:43.020 --> 22:48.170
She has a punctured lung and right now her condition is critical but stable.

22:48.170 --> 22:50.480
What is it? What's wrong?

22:51.880 --> 22:54.470
There's too much noise.

23:06.930 --> 23:09.190
Well, she's out of surgery.

23:09.190 --> 23:12.170
They were able to stop the internal bleeding but there was some damage.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.170
So, she'll be ok?

23:14.170 --> 23:17.030
Well, the doctors say the first few hours will be critical.

23:17.030 --> 23:19.000
She's a fighter.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.840
And they're hopeful she can pull through.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.130
Of course she'll pull through.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.950
She's mom. She'll be fine.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.540
Can we see her?

23:27.540 --> 23:28.720
What are you crying for?

23:28.720 --> 23:31.050
- Josh!
- We have to stay calm.

23:31.050 --> 23:34.920
Visitors aren't allowed in the ICU, but once she feels better we'll be able to get back there.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.910
We have to just sit here?

23:36.910 --> 23:39.010
I know it's hard.

23:39.010 --> 23:44.630
But we have to put our trust in her doctors.

23:44.630 --> 23:49.290
Now, they want me to fill out some forms, so I'll be back.

23:54.190 --> 23:55.500
Where's Jessi?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.120
Outside somewhere.

24:00.990 --> 24:03.440
I shouldn't have left her.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.390
If I would have got her out of the car, then... 

24:06.390 --> 24:09.210
Kyle, this isn't your fault.

24:11.590 --> 24:14.810
I can't just wait here and do nothing.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.210
Then don't.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.470
You can help her.

24:19.470 --> 24:22.340
- But Stephen said her doctors...
- Forget her doctors.

24:22.340 --> 24:24.440
All of them combined aren't as smart as you.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.440
You know I'd do anything to help Nicole.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.610
But I don't know how.

24:29.610 --> 24:31.940
And even if I did, they won't let me back there.

24:31.940 --> 24:36.490
You can't let a little thing like that stop you.

25:41.950 --> 25:45.750
If you don't know it by now, you might as well give up.

25:47.020 --> 25:49.330
Now I know it.

25:53.490 --> 25:55.510
Come on!

26:05.340 --> 26:07.840
That's not gonna make it work.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.680
I'm sure Jessi could fix it.

26:11.310 --> 26:13.070
You have to stop fighting with Jessi.

26:13.070 --> 26:16.020
Because she's the supernatural genius who saved the day?

26:16.020 --> 26:17.130
No.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.530
Because you're better than this.

26:18.530 --> 26:22.080
I sort of thought I was the one who picked fights and then stood around like an idiot 

26:22.080 --> 26:24.170
while everyone solved the problem.

26:24.170 --> 26:26.400
There is nothing you could do.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.960
That's the point.

26:27.960 --> 26:31.930
Jessi figured out where they were, Kyle delivered a baby.

26:31.930 --> 26:34.100
Even Josh was a hero.

26:34.100 --> 26:41.120
And now mom's in there and there's not a thing that I can do to help.

26:41.950 --> 26:45.380
You help just by being here.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.490
That's not much, dad.

26:47.490 --> 26:50.360
It is more than enough.

26:52.340 --> 26:55.370
It's helping me, ok?

26:55.580 --> 26:57.280
Ok.

27:09.030 --> 27:13.200
Patient is male, 23 year old mechanic, admitted non-responsive.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.300
History of depression but no drug overdose.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.490
Toxicology reports are negative.

27:17.490 --> 27:21.630
Patient was dehydrated and in metabolic acidosis.

27:21.630 --> 27:23.830
Course of action?

27:29.790 --> 27:32.370
What do you got?

27:33.630 --> 27:35.070
He's a mechanic.

27:35.070 --> 27:39.450
He may have injected antifreeze, which means possible glycol poisoning.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.790
Impressive.

27:43.850 --> 27:47.470
How is it possible we haven't worked a shift together all year?

27:47.470 --> 27:48.920
I wasn't supposed to be here today.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.910
Keep up, gentlemen.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.500
Female, car accident.

27:56.130 --> 28:00.520
Laceration to right torso, blood loss and acute internal injuries 

28:00.520 --> 28:05.910
including rib fracture, subsequent pneumothorax.

28:06.330 --> 28:10.230
Blood oxygen levels extremely low, blood pressure is down.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.240
What can we expect to see, moving forward?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.790
Possible sepsis?

28:13.790 --> 28:16.480
No sign of external infection.

28:16.480 --> 28:18.800
Anyone else?

28:18.800 --> 28:22.290
If her heart rate continues to fall, her kidneys will fail.

28:22.290 --> 28:24.030
Other organs would follow.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.190
Correct.

28:25.190 --> 28:30.870
Unfortunately, the damage is extensive and her systems have already shown signs of failure.

28:30.870 --> 28:33.160
So, we do nothing?

28:33.160 --> 28:34.430
We've done all we can.

28:34.430 --> 28:37.080
Our job now is to make sure she's comfortable.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.940
There has to be a way to heal her.

28:38.940 --> 28:41.820
Can we rebuild the cells in her damaged organs?

28:41.820 --> 28:44.330
Forward-thinking but hardly realistic.

28:44.330 --> 28:47.180
That sort of stem cell technology is years away.

28:47.180 --> 28:49.460
Now, let's move on.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.360
Andy, hey, I keep getting your voice mail.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.570
Anyway, you know how you always tell me to charge my phone in case of an emergency?

29:06.570 --> 29:09.130
Well, you were right, I was wrong.

29:09.130 --> 29:11.140
Now, I don't want you to freak out, but I'm at the hospital.

29:11.140 --> 29:14.860
I'll try to talk quick so my phone doesn't cut off... Before I can...

29:17.010 --> 29:19.270
tell you what happened.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.120
I'm sorry I left you.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.810
But I'm here now.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.120
And I'm going to make you better.

30:10.580 --> 30:12.860
I promise.

30:35.670 --> 30:39.990
Code blue, room 347, code blue, room 347.

30:40.740 --> 30:42.890
What are you doing in here?

30:43.700 --> 30:46.110
A power surge must have set off the alarm.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.360
Vitals appear stable.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.570
- Is she better?
- She'd have much better odds if you weren't interfering.

30:50.570 --> 30:54.560
If I catch you alone with her again I'll have you thrown out of the hospital.

31:04.190 --> 31:08.670
I had saved one life today by helping Gretchen's child into the world.

31:08.670 --> 31:13.680
The birth in the woods was more natural and beautiful than anything I had ever experienced.

31:13.680 --> 31:16.750
And so different from my own birth.

31:16.750 --> 31:21.270
But it had also shown me how life and death exist in uncertain equilibrium.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.900
Would I be able to save Nicole and keep the scales balanced?

31:24.900 --> 31:29.170
Did supporting one life mean I had to lose another?

31:29.880 --> 31:31.040
Jessi.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.810
Hi.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.060
I never got a chance to thank you.

31:40.060 --> 31:43.000
You got my message and sent help.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.530
You heard me.

31:47.660 --> 31:50.250
Is there any news?

31:55.070 --> 31:57.510
I couldn't help her.

31:58.170 --> 32:01.220
- With everything we can do, I can't...
- Kyle.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.360
There must be something.

32:10.190 --> 32:12.920
He's so beautiful.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.870
And she's so happy.

32:16.870 --> 32:19.040
We never had that.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.060
No.

32:21.910 --> 32:26.050
It's hard to believe he wasn't even here a few hours ago.

32:26.050 --> 32:29.720
He was still safe and protected.

32:29.720 --> 32:34.090
And all he had to do was get bigger and stronger.

32:34.360 --> 32:38.780
Now he's out here in the world and anything can happen.

32:39.590 --> 32:44.100
Do you think it's better to stay in a pod for 16 years?

32:45.910 --> 32:50.080
I guess the important thing is what we do after we're born.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.410
The fluid.

32:57.410 --> 32:58.380
What?

32:58.380 --> 33:00.550
Adam's substitute for amniotic fluid.

33:00.550 --> 33:02.630
It's what nourished us while we were in the pod.

33:02.630 --> 33:04.290
You think it could help Nicole?

33:04.290 --> 33:07.390
Adam used it to heal himself from a gunshot wound.

33:07.390 --> 33:09.920
It might help restore her damaged tissue.

33:09.920 --> 33:14.510
As far as Nicole's doctors know, that fluid doesn't even exist.

33:16.430 --> 33:19.210
There is one place you might be able to get some.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.810
Jessi, I can't ask Latnok.

33:21.810 --> 33:23.650
How could you not?

33:23.650 --> 33:26.890
I know how you feel about them, but Nicole is in trouble.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.380
You have to ask for their help.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.740
You have to try.

33:49.980 --> 33:52.800
Josh told me I could find you here.

33:55.410 --> 34:01.080
I've spent my life respecting science and logic.

34:02.060 --> 34:04.960
Rejecting religion.

34:08.719 --> 34:14.980
But when it comes right down to it, I'm sitting here praying for a miracle to spare my wife.

34:22.780 --> 34:27.330
It may not be a miracle, but I think I know a way I can help her.

34:28.760 --> 34:31.080
Adam Baylin's formula.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.340
- From the pod. I can inject it...
- Inject it?

34:33.340 --> 34:35.980
Into her IV.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.690
The doctors don't have an alternative.

34:39.690 --> 34:42.909
Kyle, you know that I... 

34:43.980 --> 34:46.679
- but this...
- Is hope.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.820
A real chance.

34:54.889 --> 34:57.980
Let me do this.

35:04.190 --> 35:05.730
Anyway, I hope you get this.

35:05.730 --> 35:09.310
My cell phone's dead so I guess I'll try again later.

35:09.310 --> 35:12.060
I don't know how you spent so much time in hospitals.

35:12.060 --> 35:15.610
I mean, I know you had to, but they're creepy and weird.

35:15.610 --> 35:18.560
I hate this waiting!

35:23.730 --> 35:29.260
I'm just... pretty scared.

35:29.690 --> 35:31.350
Andy, please.

35:31.350 --> 35:33.370
You get back.

35:33.370 --> 35:35.590
Please deposit 85 cents.

35:35.590 --> 35:37.690
Wait, wait.

35:37.690 --> 35:41.680
- Please deposit 85 cents.
- Hold on, I'm not done yet.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.710
Andy!

35:57.630 --> 35:59.150
Why are you still out here?

35:59.150 --> 36:01.570
The waiting room is for family only.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.350
You're family, sort of.

36:03.350 --> 36:05.480
Not really.

36:06.070 --> 36:08.680
Yes, you are.

36:08.680 --> 36:12.470
As much as I try to convince myself that you're not.

36:13.930 --> 36:16.600
I'm sorry I make you miserable.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.100
You don't make me miserable.

36:18.100 --> 36:22.230
I'm just... miserable person sometimes.

36:22.230 --> 36:23.890
Why?

36:23.890 --> 36:25.020
I don't know.

36:25.020 --> 36:27.310
I just am.

36:27.930 --> 36:29.560
I don't like fighting with you.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.220
Yes, you do. You're good at it.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.600
You're better.

36:32.600 --> 36:33.770
I am?

36:33.770 --> 36:36.750
You always know what to say to win.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.520
And that's something to be so proud of?

36:39.520 --> 36:43.080
Still, it's impressive.

36:44.220 --> 36:48.100
I feel like all I've been doing lately is fighting with people.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.630
You should stop.

36:50.630 --> 36:53.240
You're probably right.

36:53.240 --> 36:56.450
Especially now.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.560
Kyle will fix it.

37:01.560 --> 37:04.190
That's what he's good at.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.870
You gotta love Kyle.

37:06.870 --> 37:11.570
I mean in a platonic, brotherly sort of way.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.960
I'm sorry I said all those things to you earlier.

37:16.960 --> 37:21.600
I was panicked and I took it out on you.

37:21.600 --> 37:26.770
It's just my family.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.200
They mean everything to me.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.010
They mean everything to me, too.

37:35.010 --> 37:37.580
I know they do.

37:39.870 --> 37:43.890
She's not doing well and the doctors don't think she can make it.

37:43.890 --> 37:47.280
The fluid that Adam invented has regenerative properties.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.010
I know Latnok helped him when he was healing.

37:50.710 --> 37:54.230
And you think we kept the leftovers?

37:55.560 --> 37:59.050
My mother is dying!

38:01.370 --> 38:03.330
Please.

38:05.420 --> 38:07.030
I have what you need.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.530
I can get it to you.

38:09.530 --> 38:11.110
Thank you.

38:11.110 --> 38:14.540
But you have to do something for me.

38:16.730 --> 38:19.270
Join us at Latnok.

38:19.270 --> 38:21.630
Participate.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.860
You're using this situation?

38:22.860 --> 38:26.740
You are asking me to provide you with the one thing that might save your mother's life 

38:26.740 --> 38:30.390
yet you continue to see Latnok as evil in some way.

38:30.390 --> 38:35.850
We are all about scientific advances like Baylin's.

38:36.770 --> 38:42.190
All I'm asking you is, take part.

38:45.630 --> 38:48.190
I can have that fluid here in 20 minutes.

38:48.190 --> 38:50.940
It's your choice.

38:53.170 --> 38:59.590
A chance to save the woman who had saved my life just by letting me into hers.

38:59.590 --> 39:04.970
As far as I was concerned, my choice had already been made.

41:43.530 --> 41:46.100
She's gonna be okay.

41:59.740 --> 42:02.900
That's awesome news. She'll recover.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.910
I don't like being dishonest with him.

42:05.910 --> 42:09.220
Jessi, all you did was help lead him to the cure.

42:09.220 --> 42:10.880
Gave him a nudge in the right direction.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.680
And now Nicole's better, right?

42:13.680 --> 42:18.480
I pushed Kyle to go to Latnok today because I knew it could save Nicole's life.

42:18.480 --> 42:26.500
Now if you ever do anything to harm him, or anyone in that family, I'll kill you.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.250
I understand.
