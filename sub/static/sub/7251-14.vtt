WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:02.569
- Oh, I love them. 
- Ooh, I love them, too.

00:02.646 --> 00:04.801
With an unbridled passion. Good one, huh?

00:04.873 --> 00:05.938
I love horse humor.

00:06.414 --> 00:09.099
These guys are the best I've got 'cause they're so sweet.

00:09.184 --> 00:11.596
Hey, Michel, come on over. Meet our two new employees.

00:11.687 --> 00:14.213
You know that I do not care for the animal kingdom.

00:14.290 --> 00:16.531
Do you want me to hold them for you? 'Cause I've got a couple of others interested.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.282
Oh, yes, definitely hold them.

00:19.338 --> 00:20.715
It's Rory, Talk please

00:21.155 --> 00:23.760
Hi, Rory, it's me. How's school? You learning stuff?

00:23.889 --> 00:27.396
Listen, we have the horses, Desdemona and Cletus,

00:27.519 --> 00:29.778
and the first two rides have to be me and you.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.871
And hopefully, you're over the time that I took you for the pony ride,

00:31.932 --> 00:34.405
and the pony was old and just sort of stopped and laid down,

00:34.451 --> 00:37.913
and you sort of rolled off into the ditch. It's really not likely to happen again.

00:38.026 --> 00:40.216
I promise. So, call me, call me.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.144
Hey, Tom, how do you like our new horses?

00:44.456 --> 00:46.033
Very fragrant. Follow me.

00:47.001 --> 00:49.162
He's very busy. Don't judge him too harshly.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.354
Hey, guys, how's National Goof-off day going? That's what I thought.

00:54.225 --> 00:57.588
Now, we got downstairs hardware being delivered on Wednesday morning.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.790
- Yippee. 
- Yeah, it excites me too.

00:59.898 --> 01:03.400
So, I think it would be exciting to have one of you here to see that it's the right stuff.

01:03.539 --> 01:05.434
Otherwise, things would come to a crashing halt.

01:05.541 --> 01:08.198
Oh boy, I got back to back meetings on Wednesday, and one of them is in Hartford.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.452
- Sook? 
- I can be here.

01:09.995 --> 01:12.248
Oh no, I can't - Davey has a check up that morning.

01:12.391 --> 01:13.118
Can you move it?

01:13.393 --> 01:16.302
- This doctor's really booked. But I can try. 
- That's okay. Michel?

01:16.364 --> 01:19.646
I'm at the Tally Rand making the money that keeps me from having to stand

01:19.708 --> 01:22.406
at expressway off-ramps selling bags of cherries.

01:22.513 --> 01:26.005
Okay. Oh well, I guess I can move some things around. I don't…

01:26.563 --> 01:28.053
- What is that? 
- That's your phone.

01:28.519 --> 01:31.105
- Who's phone? Our phone? 
- I installed it this morning.

01:31.462 --> 01:34.162
You wanted your phone up and running, right? To take reservations?

01:34.495 --> 01:36.681
- Oh, my God. 
- Our first reservation.

01:36.757 --> 01:38.601
Quick, quick, answer before they hang up.

01:39.211 --> 01:41.120
- Hello? 
- Dragonfly, Dragonfly.

01:41.186 --> 01:43.849
- Say Dragonfly Inn. 
- I mean, Dragonfly Iinn, hello.

01:43.952 --> 01:47.631
Why, yes! We are taking reservations.

01:48.104 --> 01:49.634
Our opening day is May 6th.

01:50.168 --> 01:52.137
May 8th and 9th, okay, great.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.868
Let me just check. Let me check.

01:56.009 --> 02:00.823
Okay. You got it, and you're getting our best room. Let me just get your information here.

02:01.615 --> 02:04.443
Yes. Okay. And your number?

02:06.042 --> 02:12.260
7873. Okay. Got your name. Got your number. Got you down for the 8th and 9th.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.965
Thank you, Mr. Turner. See you then.

02:14.889 --> 02:16.561
- We're up and running. 
- We're up and running!

02:16.711 --> 02:19.167
- But you wrote it down on a gum wrapper. 
- So?

02:19.259 --> 02:21.610
It's embarrassing. This is an historical document.

02:22.734 --> 02:24.483
Who cares what she wrote it down on?

02:24.794 --> 02:27.462
- Big Red wrapper. 
- Juicyfruit would have been better?

02:28.219 --> 02:30.903
Well, I'm going to go out and get a value pack

02:30.960 --> 02:33.088
for when things really start getting busy around here.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:29.845 --> 03:31.934
Mom, it's me, I left you a message at home, too.

03:32.190 --> 03:35.645
I love that you got horses. As far as that pony ride when I was a kid,

03:35.890 --> 03:39.491
you were forgetting one little tidbit there. That pony did not lie down.

03:39.608 --> 03:41.544
He died, okay? He died.

03:41.626 --> 03:44.144
And then the owner dragged him away by the back legs.

03:44.253 --> 03:46.919
Every time I use glue, I think of him. But I'll watch you ride, how's that?

03:47.139 --> 03:48.092
Call me back, bye.

03:48.257 --> 03:50.520
- What are you doing here? 
- I live here.

03:50.575 --> 03:52.820
- But you have game theory class in fifteen minutes. 
- I just thought I would lie down and rest for a while.

03:52.865 --> 03:56.391
I knew it. You were up too late last night. I know I should have told you "lights out."

03:56.454 --> 03:58.400
- I had to finish my paper. 
- Your brain needs sleep.

03:58.451 --> 04:01.231
- It can sleep when I finish my paper. 
- And then there'll be another paper.

04:01.318 --> 04:02.762
- Mom... 
- You know what I mean.

04:02.899 --> 04:05.136
- You look out for me. 
- It's what I do. Okay, go lay down.

04:05.213 --> 04:06.670
- Yes, ma'am. 
- And stay off drugs.

04:09.586 --> 04:13.084
- Whoa, what's that smell? 
- It's the smoke from my soldering iron.

04:13.314 --> 04:16.226
I love it. I love burning things.

04:16.372 --> 04:21.086
I love the hot tip of my soldering iron as it liquefies metal and singes the wires...

04:21.170 --> 04:22.290
Honey, how long you been doing that?

04:22.812 --> 04:25.055
- Three hours. 
- Take a break.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.917
Oh, good, you're all here, so we can clear this up.

04:28.097 --> 04:30.565
I found this lying around, and it must belong to one of you

04:30.635 --> 04:32.771
because who else would have clothing here? I ask you

04:33.135 --> 04:35.285
- Anyone? Anyone? 
- Paris.

04:35.402 --> 04:38.238
Anyone? You know, maybe I misspoke.

04:38.506 --> 04:41.321
It may not be a shirt. Anyone lose a car cover?

04:41.429 --> 04:43.825
- Anyone? Anyone? 
- Knock it off.

04:43.948 --> 04:46.682
I'm just trying to find a nice way to tell you that your behemoth boyfriend

04:46.749 --> 04:49.621
is getting a little too comfortable around here. And I speak for everyone.

04:49.703 --> 04:51.105
- Leave me out of this. 
- Me too, please.

04:51.157 --> 04:53.629
I just don't want to walk into our bathroom and find him sitting on the john

04:53.711 --> 04:56.016
- shooting up steroids. 
- He does not take steroids.

04:56.103 --> 04:58.330
You mean that unsightly girth is nature given?

04:58.422 --> 05:00.322
- He must curse God nightly. 
- Enough!

05:00.399 --> 05:03.503
And the shirt -- stick a pole in it, and Cirque Du Soleil could start selling tickets.

05:03.562 --> 05:04.787
He's big, Paris. She got it.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.492
And why does he have his name written on the back?

05:06.856 --> 05:10.394
So it's easy to check when he forgets it? Although if he checks it while he's wearing it,

05:10.470 --> 05:13.756
he'd have to look in a mirror, and then he'd probably think his name was Dlobeelk,

05:13.844 --> 05:16.306
- and get confused all over again. 
- Bitter little woman.

05:16.368 --> 05:19.343
If he's gonna continue being an unwelcome guest in our place,

05:19.415 --> 05:22.968
I emphasize the word "our," keep him penned in your room.

05:23.019 --> 05:24.760
- Jealousy doesn't become you, Paris. 
- What jealousy?

05:24.832 --> 05:27.023
- Break it up, guys. 
- Neither does makeup or a hairstyle.

05:27.116 --> 05:27.986
Can it, Blondie.

05:28.082 --> 05:31.125
You drove your own boyfriend away, so you hate that anyone else has one.

05:31.196 --> 05:31.923
Oh please.

05:32.004 --> 05:34.098
Yeah, why don't you go sit all alone in your room

05:34.166 --> 05:36.387
so you can start getting used to how the rest of your life's gonna be.

05:36.463 --> 05:37.634
- I'm not alone. 
- Oh, really?

05:37.729 --> 05:40.380
Who do you have besides your poster of Noam Chomsky?

05:40.467 --> 05:41.675
- Who do I have? 
- Yeah.

05:43.719 --> 05:46.356
That's what I thought. Very sad.

05:52.526 --> 05:55.326
I'm gonna grab Barbie's neck and squeeze until her expandable hair falls out

05:55.409 --> 05:57.047
- and she's dead, dead, dead. 
- Are you staying in here,

05:57.109 --> 05:58.716
because I was gonna close my eyes for a little while.

05:58.844 --> 06:00.661
I should just tell her Asher Fleming's my man

06:00.722 --> 06:03.589
so she can compare her circa 1972 Lou Ferrigno with him.

06:03.683 --> 06:06.616
- Then tell her. Put this to rest. 
- You know we're keeping it on the down low.

06:06.723 --> 06:08.454
It's easier this way. You're the only person that knows.

06:08.526 --> 06:10.804
Then you're gonna have to swallow stuff like that and not let it get to you.

06:11.102 --> 06:13.319
He smells. That fat tub of hers smells.

06:13.804 --> 06:16.461
Hey, did you keep your notes from when you took Major English Poets?

06:16.697 --> 06:17.502
I've got them somewhere.

06:17.707 --> 06:18.935
- Can I borrow them? 
- Sure.

06:19.053 --> 06:22.110
Great, 'cause that means I can skip a class this week. Buys me two hours.

06:22.713 --> 06:25.698
I taught Asher that phrase, "on the down low." He called it delightful.

06:25.816 --> 06:26.999
It's a delightful phrase.

06:27.885 --> 06:30.900
You know, maybe it's not Janet's boyfriend I can't be around.

06:31.048 --> 06:33.784
Maybe I just can't be around boys, because I have a man.

06:34.447 --> 06:36.114
Yes, that's it. Resting now.

06:39.512 --> 06:40.358
Wait, wait.

06:40.685 --> 06:42.528
Hey, I've got nothing cute to say for my message.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.395
Oh, puppies. There, that's cute. Now leave yours.

06:45.774 --> 06:47.489
Hello? Pick up, pick up, pick up.

06:47.612 --> 06:48.502
Wait, I'm here. Wait.

06:48.580 --> 06:53.020
I'm running as we speak to not be late for my first official day as a full-fledged food-hall card swiper.

06:53.076 --> 06:56.823
That's right, I'm no longer a trainee. After one and a half hours of rigorous training,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.931
I am fully independent and in no need of supervision.

06:59.350 --> 07:03.285
Whoops, sorry. Just ran into somebody, and he's down.

07:03.511 --> 07:05.949
- Wait, hold it. I'm coming. 
- I assume you're very proud of me. Talk to you later.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.430
Rory, I'm here.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.492
Of course, you had to be in a big hurry.

07:13.837 --> 07:17.437
- It's Rory. Talk, please. 
- Hi. Yeah, of course I'm proud.

07:17.513 --> 07:19.444
Card swiping -- who knew you had it in you?

07:19.541 --> 07:22.250
Not I. I'm sorry I can't be there to witness this moment.

07:22.311 --> 07:26.484
It's certainly as big a moment as, oh, your first baby step and your first fall on your face,

07:26.560 --> 07:29.258
which came back to back. Hopefully, somebody's taking lots of pictures.

07:29.346 --> 07:33.140
Call my cell or call me at Jason's. We gotta stop meeting like this, hon. Bye.

07:35.494 --> 07:37.434
Hey, Rory, if you're gonna completely ignore me,

07:37.548 --> 07:39.750
I might as well go hang out with my ex-girlfriend. Same thing.

07:39.867 --> 07:40.752
Oh, sorry, Glenn.

07:41.070 --> 07:44.291
Everyone is going to be sorry one day -- everyone.

07:44.573 --> 07:46.734
You really gotta stop watching "Taxi Driver," Glenn.

07:50.768 --> 07:53.959
Oh, did you want me to -- well, it works for me.

07:57.404 --> 07:58.228
Hello?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.854
- Rory, hi, it's Dean. 
- Dean, hi.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.917
- Bad time? 
- No.

08:03.158 --> 08:05.761
I just thought you would be my mom, but my mom doesn't speak

08:05.867 --> 08:08.463
- in a resonant basso profundo. 
- A what?

08:09.344 --> 08:10.342
I'm babbling.

08:10.541 --> 08:13.061
So I wanted to run something by you to see if it was okay.

08:13.270 --> 08:15.559
- Sure. 
- You know the contractor, Tom?

08:15.698 --> 08:17.003
- Grumpy puss? 
- That's him.

08:17.142 --> 08:21.417
He's offered me a job working on his crew. It's good pay. It's flexible hours.

08:21.565 --> 08:22.317
Excellent.

08:22.492 --> 08:25.256
At the inn. Your mom's inn. Is that okay?

08:25.353 --> 08:27.678
- The Dragonfly? 
- If it's not okay, I won't do it.

08:27.730 --> 08:28.543
Why wouldn't it be okay?

08:28.629 --> 08:30.940
Well, it would occasionally put you and me around each other,

08:30.980 --> 08:32.542
and I didn't know how awkward that would be.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.123
No. Dean, it's fine. It wouldn't be awkward at all.

08:35.205 --> 08:37.648
- You're sure? 
- Tom knows quality when he sees it -- take the job.

08:37.708 --> 08:40.304
Good, I just didn't know where we stood after my wedding and all.

08:40.775 --> 08:42.438
You guys didn't come.

08:43.361 --> 08:45.972
- Yeah, I'm so sorry about that. 
- It was short notice.

08:46.064 --> 08:48.855
And we got jammed on some things. But you got our gift?

08:48.921 --> 08:50.856
Yeah, Lindsay spins a salad in it every night.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.807
That's weird, considering we got you a toaster.

08:53.151 --> 08:54.748
- No, you didn't. 
- I'm joshing ya.

08:54.816 --> 08:57.835
- So, I guess I'll take the job. 
- Are you still going to school, too?

08:57.933 --> 09:00.943
Part time, but everything's good. I've got a five-year plan.

09:01.015 --> 09:01.876
Five years.

09:02.823 --> 09:05.459
Cool. I've got about the next two and a half hours planned,

09:05.531 --> 09:08.628
and then there's just darkness and possibly some dragons.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.418
Hey, I made the plunge. I got my own cellphone.

09:11.548 --> 09:13.483
I thought you sounded a little cellphone-y.

09:13.667 --> 09:17.337
Lindsay and her mom got a good deal on a family plan, so I signed up.

09:17.439 --> 09:18.198
It was time.

09:18.997 --> 09:21.085
You know, I don't even know your number anymore.

09:21.464 --> 09:23.814
- I can give you this one. 
- Actually, I can just save it.

09:23.926 --> 09:26.073
- You are officially part of my phone log. 
- Good.

09:27.691 --> 09:31.956
- Well, I'll let you go, and I'll see you once in awhile. 
- Inevitability.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.160
And you'll have to tell me what that bass thing was that you said.

09:35.258 --> 09:36.344
Something to look forward to.

09:36.635 --> 09:37.685
- Bye. 
- Bye.

09:42.308 --> 09:44.940
Come on! Step up, step up. Don't be mice.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.738
No, we did pick a tile for the bedroom suite bathroom. I distinctly remember.

09:49.861 --> 09:53.205
Make it a semicolon before the clause about interest rates and keep reading.

09:53.276 --> 09:54.530
Eight weeks ago, ten weeks ago?

09:54.642 --> 09:58.784
No, it is okay to end a sentence with a preposition now. I read it in Safire's column.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.221
I remember the guy, I don't remember the tile. I do remember the color, white.

10:02.287 --> 10:05.768
Safire. He came up with nattering nabobs of negativism for Agnew.

10:05.834 --> 10:08.482
No, I meant the tile was white, but the guy was, too.

10:08.580 --> 10:11.416
Agnew was Nixon's vice president. You know we're getting a little off the subject.

10:11.481 --> 10:14.345
- Can you just please keep reading? 
- Over 200 shades of white? I did not know that.

10:14.412 --> 10:17.636
With sincerely yours, et cetera, forge my signature and get it out tonight.

10:17.723 --> 10:21.006
- We'll look at the samples again and that's okay. 
- I'll see you tomorrow, thank you.

10:21.103 --> 10:26.377
- Thank you. All right, bye-bye. 
- Okay, I am done. Round two?

10:26.479 --> 10:30.355
Well, this is very romantic. I mean, I'm over here arguing about tile,

10:30.411 --> 10:32.982
and you're over there arguing about William Safire.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.788
Whatever happened to the cigarette after sex?

10:34.932 --> 10:37.261
Oh no. Trust me, William Safire is much hotter.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.292
We're the all-business corporate couple.

10:40.543 --> 10:42.054
Brought to you by Marriott.

10:43.150 --> 10:44.363
- I gotta get that. 
- Oh no, no, no.

10:44.538 --> 10:46.606
I told Rory to call me here. Hello?

10:46.758 --> 10:49.494
Well, guess who's demanding we all make an appearance at lunch?

10:49.641 --> 10:52.315
- Mom! 
- Your grandmother is coming back from Palm Beach.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.856
What are you doing?

10:53.948 --> 10:56.395
Your father has to run over to her house to open it up for her,

10:56.519 --> 10:59.241
and then she will be coming over here for the evening to berate me

10:59.313 --> 11:02.529
- and tell me that my couch has some sort of smell. 
- Oh, well, that sounds fun.

11:02.805 --> 11:06.922
She wants to have lunch -- sorry, a luncheon -- the day after tomorrow.

11:06.993 --> 11:09.831
You, me, your father, and apparently she wants to meet Jason.

11:09.897 --> 11:13.031
All we need is that filthy Eminem fellow to make it a perfect afternoon for me.

11:13.101 --> 11:15.712
Well, I'll try to track him down, Mom, but you know, he might be on tour or something.

11:15.780 --> 11:18.642
Just be here and be on time, and get your hair cut.

11:18.734 --> 11:21.688
You looked like the bird lady from Mary Poppins the last time I saw you.

11:21.770 --> 11:24.965
- Well, Mom, I've been very busy lately. 
- I don't care how busy you've been, Lorelai.

11:25.064 --> 11:28.759
If your hair looks a mess, it will be my fault, and I don't need that responsibility right now.

11:28.984 --> 11:30.034
I'll see you at noon.

11:31.617 --> 11:33.050
- What are you doing? 
- I'm getting undressed.

11:33.158 --> 11:34.637
- You were already undressed. 
- Well, my mother called.

11:34.765 --> 11:37.171
- So? 
- So, I can't talk to my mother naked.

11:37.305 --> 11:38.856
- How would she know? 
- She'd know.

11:39.148 --> 11:42.379
Is it like a super power? She can hear naked people?

11:42.568 --> 11:47.299
Yes, she can. She can hear sin and depravity and all sorts of lustful things.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.241
Boy, do I wish I could get bitten by that radioactive spider.

11:53.223 --> 11:55.558
Please, please try to work me in.

11:55.905 --> 11:59.801
My hair is long and unmanageable, and I need that scalp-massaging thing

11:59.874 --> 12:03.187
that Cindy does after she washes my hair. It makes me think I'm in Tahiti.

12:03.351 --> 12:07.277
Hey! They put pipes in the kitchen. We're almost able to run water!

12:07.343 --> 12:08.582
Sookie, give me a second here.

12:08.832 --> 12:11.087
Is Cindy there -- she's usually able to work me in.

12:11.793 --> 12:15.080
I'm not trying to go around you. Cindy and I are old friends.

12:15.204 --> 12:17.676
They are beautiful pipes. The pipes are really big!

12:17.830 --> 12:20.108
- Sookie, the pipes will be there in two minutes? 
- Sure.

12:20.732 --> 12:23.498
Look, it won't take long. It's an easy cut. I'm very low maintenance.

12:23.564 --> 12:26.093
I might not seem like it now, but I'd be a delight to have in the place,

12:26.150 --> 12:29.626
and I'll even dry my own hair. I'll bring my own blow dryer, even.

12:30.590 --> 12:33.246
Yes? Tomorrow? Yes.

12:33.983 --> 12:36.589
Eleven o'clock, I'll be there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

12:37.474 --> 12:39.651
- Hi, Lorelai. 
- Hey, Dean. So you're working here?

12:39.744 --> 12:42.590
Yeah, I thought maybe Rory would have told you.

12:42.728 --> 12:46.686
- Oh, Rory and I keep missing each other. 
- Well, I'm here, and your hair looks fine to me.

12:46.851 --> 12:48.325
Oh, well, you're very kind.

12:48.555 --> 12:51.371
Lorelai, can I talk to you and Sookie over here for a minute?

12:51.582 --> 12:52.348
- See ya. 
- Bye.

12:52.616 --> 12:53.306
Sook?

12:54.695 --> 12:58.606
- Tom, I gotta tell ya, these pipes. 
- She's very thrilled about the pipes.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.986
Yeah, they're terrific pipes, and you got that fancy sink coming in tomorrow morning.

13:02.057 --> 13:04.151
And you told them they can't install it until I see it, right?

13:04.203 --> 13:07.345
- Because I have very specific sink needs. 
- They won't even leave it without your approval.

13:07.736 --> 13:09.629
Can you guys give us a little space here?

13:10.458 --> 13:12.250
- You okay, Tom? 
- This is kind of tricky.

13:12.579 --> 13:14.641
- What is? 
- You know I like you two, right?

13:14.984 --> 13:16.286
- We know that. 
- Sure.

13:16.387 --> 13:19.798
I gotta deal with a lot of jerks in my business, yelling at you when it's not your fault,

13:19.925 --> 13:23.479
bugging you about budget increases you got no control over. You don't do that.

13:23.572 --> 13:26.171
You always smell good, too. That's a plus.

13:26.367 --> 13:30.668
So maybe the checks are getting lost in the mail. I'm guessing it's something like that.

13:30.749 --> 13:32.752
The checks? What checks? Our checks?

13:32.905 --> 13:36.330
It's just, in the last few weeks, we've been having some cash flow issues.

13:36.474 --> 13:39.002
- Oh, this is hard. 
- Are we not paying him?

13:39.146 --> 13:40.687
I've been wanting to talk to you about that, Tom.

13:40.847 --> 13:42.516
- Are we not paying him? 
- No, no. We're paying him,

13:42.582 --> 13:45.628
we're just not paying him the way we should be. It's been an avalanche lately.

13:45.685 --> 13:48.111
You got a lot of things happening here. Everything's going at once.

13:48.175 --> 13:52.454
I feel very antsy right now, like I just ate some dark chocolate and drank an espresso.

13:52.555 --> 13:57.242
Okay. Let me talk to Tom for a second, hon. We'll clear it up, really. Go, go.

13:58.843 --> 14:01.439
Boy, I'm sorry about this, Tom. It's just been a deluge.

14:01.526 --> 14:03.712
It's the home stretch -- that's usually when a deluge hits.

14:03.845 --> 14:07.615
I was talking to the bank about a line of credit, but they didn't go for it.

14:07.742 --> 14:09.736
- Banks suck. 
- I meant to talk to you sooner.

14:09.815 --> 14:13.845
The thing is, if I don't get paid, I can't pay my guys, then they tend to stop showing up.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.897
- So, do you have to shut down? 
- I can keep it going awhile longer.

14:16.972 --> 14:19.338
For the jerks, I'd shut down. You guys, nah.

14:19.420 --> 14:20.773
Thank you. Thanks, Tom.

14:21.274 --> 14:23.844
Now, hug, no hug?

14:24.182 --> 14:28.315
I'm kinda dirty. How about if you whistle at me later in front of the guys when I walk by?

14:28.387 --> 14:29.666
- Drive 'em nuts. 
- You got it.

14:31.520 --> 14:35.063
Hey. I should have talked to you sooner.

14:35.161 --> 14:36.947
- Are we dead broke? 
- Getting there.

14:37.162 --> 14:41.058
Well, we'll start cutting corners. I mean, I don't need that big, fancy stove from France.

14:41.135 --> 14:42.793
- We'll skip that. 
- No way!

14:42.882 --> 14:45.020
It's too expensive, and I don't want it that much.

14:45.128 --> 14:46.788
Sookie, you have four pictures in your wallet.

14:46.910 --> 14:49.623
One of Jackson, one of the baby, and two of that stove.

14:49.711 --> 14:50.689
You're getting that stove.

14:51.150 --> 14:54.606
- But we could drop the horses. 
- Desi and Cletus, over my dead body.

14:54.688 --> 14:57.934
Well, the upkeep is astronomical. Maybe if we drop one of the horses.

14:57.990 --> 14:59.424
And who's making that choice, Sophie?

14:59.537 --> 15:02.220
How about Jackson? Would he be willing to put up anything?

15:02.307 --> 15:04.745
He just bought a bunch of new farm equipment. He's strapped.

15:04.845 --> 15:07.755
Are you suddenly on super-fantastic terms with your parents?

15:07.868 --> 15:12.885
If by fantastic, you mean are we as close as that one-armed surfer girl and the shark, then yes.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.912
- Then what about Luke? 
- What about him?

15:15.035 --> 15:17.079
- He's offered before. 
- Out of pity.

15:17.144 --> 15:19.966
- We're pretty damn pitiable right now. 
- He's our friend.

15:20.027 --> 15:22.828
He's more than that. And he's a hermit, so we know he's got money,

15:22.878 --> 15:25.638
and if he didn't want to lend it to you, he'd tell you to your face.

15:25.732 --> 15:27.092
That would be embarrassing.

15:27.247 --> 15:29.944
More embarrassing than Tom almost crying because we're not paying him?

15:30.134 --> 15:31.256
No, I guess not.

15:31.378 --> 15:35.469
I'll put my thinking cap on, you put yours on, and if we come up with someone better, we'll talk.

15:35.864 --> 15:38.961
- But we'll keep Luke as a last resort. 
- Last resort.

15:40.595 --> 15:43.380
- This is ridiculous, Paris. 
- He can sit in your room.

15:43.467 --> 15:45.377
- I'm still getting ready! 
- Then he can sit in the hallway!

15:45.438 --> 15:47.650
- What's your problem? 
- I'll tell you my problem, Andre.

15:47.743 --> 15:51.080
Last time you sat on our couch, your mesomorphic frame carved a four-foot crater in it.

15:51.137 --> 15:53.411
- I felt like I was sitting in a bucket. 
- You're so full of it, Paris.

15:53.492 --> 15:56.845
Kids were skateboarding up and down it. Gandalf the Grey is still falling down it.

15:56.902 --> 15:58.806
- It was a big hole. 
- What does mesomorphic mean?

15:58.884 --> 16:01.239
- It means you've got a fat ass, pal. 
- Just ignore her and sit, Klee.

16:01.306 --> 16:02.976
- Do not sit Klee. 
- It's my place, too.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.858
Yours, not that brobdingnagian twit.

16:04.951 --> 16:07.061
So every friend I bring here has to pass your anal standards?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.338
No, he just has to pass through the door without damaging the frame.

16:09.425 --> 16:11.540
- Oh, forget it. Just come into my room, Klee. 
- Good!

16:11.617 --> 16:14.346
- Got another hot night at the library planned, Paris? 
- He's still in here!

16:14.408 --> 16:16.711
- There's nothing like the bitterness of the lonely. 
- Yeah.

16:16.778 --> 16:19.245
- Nice addition, Potsie. 
- Go put on your spinster dress.

16:24.602 --> 16:27.253
I'm moving or she is. One of us has gotta go.

16:27.678 --> 16:29.993
- I really hate when you guys fight. 
- Calling me a spinster.

16:30.275 --> 16:31.939
I should stick a javelin in her brain.

16:32.236 --> 16:34.535
You should tell her about the professor, that would shut her up.

16:34.836 --> 16:37.217
What? What did you say?

16:37.611 --> 16:40.667
Just that she thinks you're not dating, and you are. You are, aren't you? Asher Fleming?

16:46.562 --> 16:48.261
So busy-busy. I know you are, too.

16:48.410 --> 16:51.778
And I think I'm coming down with swipe wrist. It's like carpal tunnel, only swipier.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.287
Call me if you have any suggestions on how to combat this

16:54.338 --> 16:57.216
or if you have Jerry Lewis' number, because maybe his next telethon should be for me.

16:57.497 --> 16:59.790
- Rory. 
- Oh, geez. Paris, you scared me.

16:59.884 --> 17:01.410
You told. Come here.

17:01.773 --> 17:03.584
- I'm working. 
- Swipe 'em yourself, people.

17:04.214 --> 17:04.896
What?

17:06.222 --> 17:08.803
- You told Lane about me and Asher? 
- What?

17:08.884 --> 17:11.300
That was a secret between you and me. You're the only one I told.

17:11.538 --> 17:13.798
- I just told Lane. 
- She was blabbing it around our suite.

17:13.861 --> 17:16.267
- That doesn't sound like Lane. 
- She said it to me, so she probably told everyone.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.730
- Who else did you blab it to? 
- I didn't blab it. I just told Lane.

17:18.853 --> 17:19.492
That's blabbing.

17:19.929 --> 17:22.852
Well, I told her before she had any connection to Yale. She wasn't living here.

17:22.913 --> 17:24.166
- She shouldn't be living here. 
- What?

17:24.239 --> 17:25.740
- She knows too much. 
- What are you going to do, kill her?

17:25.816 --> 17:26.888
- You didn't tell anyone else? 
- No.

17:26.953 --> 17:28.079
Your milk man, your minister?

17:28.156 --> 17:31.951
Just Lane, and I can tell her not to bring it up ever again, especially at Yale, especially in our room.

17:32.012 --> 17:33.901
- She shouldn't be here, Rory. 
- It's just temporary.

17:33.983 --> 17:36.979
That suite is crowded enough with the four of us, plus the Jolly Green Giant

17:37.036 --> 17:38.740
and everyone else passing through there. She's gotta go.

17:38.816 --> 17:40.961
- You're just mad about what she said. 
- Janet and Tanna think so, too.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.194
- No they don't. 
- We've talked. It's crowded. Ask them.

17:43.276 --> 17:44.499
I will. After my shift.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.310
Look, I know you like having her around, that she brings back memories

17:47.370 --> 17:50.117
of those sunshiny Stars Hollow days when the two of you would hold hands,

17:50.172 --> 17:52.455
and skip through fields of wildflowers, and sing Carpenter songs,

17:52.543 --> 17:56.352
but she doesn't belong here, she belongs there. And do me a favor and stop blabbing.

18:04.822 --> 18:08.610
Hey, Janet? Could you stop sit-upping for a sec?

18:09.091 --> 18:11.447
- I'm done. What's up? 
- Well, Paris...

18:11.908 --> 18:13.462
Don't talk to me about Paris.

18:13.837 --> 18:16.131
Yeah, I know, she said some stupid things.

18:16.239 --> 18:17.324
What a tremendous shock.

18:17.478 --> 18:20.485
Yeah, and I'm a little mad that she dragged you two into it.

18:20.565 --> 18:21.753
What did she drag us into?

18:21.880 --> 18:25.265
Well, she said that you guys weren't happy that Lane is still staying here,

18:25.327 --> 18:28.107
which is weird because Lane has been practically invisible.

18:28.195 --> 18:31.108
That is, when she's not cleaning the bathroom or picking up out here

18:31.214 --> 18:34.374
or bringing us coffee, et cetera, et cetera. And that's not true

18:34.472 --> 18:37.549
that you're tired of her being here, is it? That's just Paris?

18:37.979 --> 18:40.328
- Well, it is a little weird. 
- It is?

18:40.518 --> 18:43.069
- It's kind of close quarters in here. 
- I know.

18:43.175 --> 18:44.839
- She doesn't go here. 
- I know that, too.

18:44.952 --> 18:45.643
It's weird

18:46.365 --> 18:49.821
- And you guys have all talked about it? 
- A little -- we thought she'd be gone by now.

18:49.908 --> 18:51.348
I'm not good at confrontations.

18:51.459 --> 18:55.172
Personally, I'd vote Paris out over Lane in a heartbeat, but Paris goes here.

18:55.253 --> 18:55.914
I see.

18:56.764 --> 18:58.397
- Are you mad? 
- No, no.

18:59.504 --> 19:00.267
Carry on.

19:04.117 --> 19:06.549
- Hey, how was work? 
- Fine, dull.

19:06.927 --> 19:08.831
- You gonna study some more? 
- I'm gonna have to.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.654
- You look very serious. 
- Yeah.

19:12.119 --> 19:13.861
- Paris talk to you? 
- Yeah.

19:14.035 --> 19:15.713
- She was very mad. 
- Yeah.

19:15.830 --> 19:16.717
I'm out, aren't I?

19:19.062 --> 19:23.685
- It's okay. It couldn't last forever. It's time. 
- It's not time. Let me talk to them again.

19:23.762 --> 19:27.187
No, it's time. I can't be here forever. I don't even go here.

19:27.259 --> 19:29.624
- The janitor's always here. He doesn't go here. 
- He works here.

19:29.686 --> 19:31.867
- So get a job here. 
- The jobs here are for the students.

19:32.006 --> 19:34.007
- The janitor's not a student. 
- You know what I mean.

19:34.268 --> 19:35.707
- So enroll. 
- Go to Yale?

19:35.830 --> 19:39.802
Or be a janitor. Yale, janitor, in a hundred years, we'll all be dead. It's all the same.

19:39.884 --> 19:43.746
No, this hasn't been fair to anyone here. I need to go. I'll go tomorrow morning.

19:47.991 --> 19:51.129
We used to talk about living together. Remember, when we were little?

19:52.045 --> 19:54.304
- I know. 
- It was going to be a house made of cheese.

19:54.406 --> 19:58.625
We had much debate about that. It was down to chocolate, cheese, or Brillo pads.

19:58.706 --> 20:00.797
- Why Brillo pads? 
- I think they just made us laugh.

20:01.109 --> 20:03.545
- You brought Stars Hollow here. 
- I'll visit. I promise.

20:04.241 --> 20:04.780
Good.

20:05.563 --> 20:07.576
Maybe one day we'll live in a house made of cheese.

20:08.072 --> 20:09.044
I hope so.

20:14.829 --> 20:18.932
Oh, I love shampoo sinks. They're like a hot tub for your head.

20:18.972 --> 20:22.055
Hey, listen, Lee Ann, don't tell Cindy, but you're better, much better. Those hands...

20:23.308 --> 20:26.571
- Oh, no. Oh, no, not now. 
- Ignore it.

20:26.673 --> 20:31.449
It could be my daughter. We've been missing each other for days. Sorry.

20:32.286 --> 20:32.971
Hello?

20:34.677 --> 20:36.596
No, this is she.

20:37.435 --> 20:39.919
No, no, Sookie's there. Yes, it was all arranged.

20:41.214 --> 20:43.487
Everywhere? You've looked everywhere? In the kitchen near the pipes?

20:43.554 --> 20:45.028
She loves those pipes. Did you look there?

20:45.771 --> 20:49.397
No, no, don't leave, please. I'll get someone down there to sign for it. Just please don't leave.

20:50.493 --> 20:52.264
I know. Ten minutes. Okay.

20:52.929 --> 20:54.193
Sookie, where are you?

20:55.939 --> 20:57.127
Hi, this is Sookie.

20:57.189 --> 20:57.895
And Jackson.

20:57.994 --> 21:00.491
And Davey. And Davey wants to say hello, too.

21:00.569 --> 21:04.418
Go ahead, Davey, say hello. Come on, say hi. Say hi.

21:04.540 --> 21:07.147
- Oh, he's licking the phone. 
- Don't lick the phone.

21:07.239 --> 21:09.788
Little peepers. Little peepers, does the phone taste good?

21:09.857 --> 21:11.094
Oh, for God's sake.

21:11.248 --> 21:15.350
- I think it tastes like candy. 
- Do you want to say it tastes like candy, huh?

21:15.452 --> 21:18.688
Oh he waved! Okay, so here comes the beep.

21:19.641 --> 21:21.346
Shorten it, dq'd it, and call me back.

21:24.238 --> 21:27.858
- Tally Rand Hotel, may I help you? 
- Michel, good! Listen, emergency, can you...

21:27.946 --> 21:29.431
You are not going to believe this.

21:29.666 --> 21:34.170
Celine Dion is here. I'm not five feet away from her.

21:34.260 --> 21:35.936
Cool, Spiffy. Listen, is there any way you could...

21:36.024 --> 21:40.462
Oh, my heart is pounding through my chest. She's so beautiful.

21:40.561 --> 21:41.851
Yeah, she's very pretty. Listen!

21:41.994 --> 21:45.932
She's lovelier in person than she is on TV, and so nice.

21:46.035 --> 21:48.227
I've only heard good things about her. Listen, can you please...

21:48.307 --> 21:51.364
And I have a pimple today. Of all the days to have a pimple.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.909
Michel, listen. Can you get to the inn? It's really important,

21:53.991 --> 21:56.469
- and Sookie didn't show, and I'm desperate. 
- I can't get away.

21:56.561 --> 21:59.638
- I've got wet hair. 
- She sneezed. I should give her my hanky.

21:59.725 --> 22:00.908
Forget it. I'll talk to you later.

22:02.608 --> 22:05.622
Lee Ann, what can you do for my hair in two minutes?

22:06.565 --> 22:07.381
I figured.

22:12.613 --> 22:13.293
Coming.

22:15.269 --> 22:16.335
Okay, I'm coming.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.876
You said you were gonna meet the sink guy at the inn.

22:21.127 --> 22:22.474
- I did? 
- Yeah, Sookie, you did.

22:22.571 --> 22:25.259
You said you were going to meet him to approve the sink and sign for it?

22:25.572 --> 22:28.797
- Oh, Tom could have done that. 
- No, Sookie, Tom couldn't have done that

22:28.935 --> 22:32.390
because you insisted that you had to approve the sink before it was installed.

22:32.826 --> 22:35.058
I did? Oh, I did, didn't I?

22:35.428 --> 22:38.980
Oh, shoot, oh, shoot, oh, shoot, oh, sugar foot.

22:39.139 --> 22:42.226
If there was ever a time to use the real word, this would be it.

22:42.468 --> 22:45.953
Well, just call them, have them deliver the sink tomorrow.

22:46.057 --> 22:47.614
No, no, Sookie, they can't deliver the sink tomorrow.

22:47.827 --> 22:50.270
- Why? 
- Because they already sent it back to Canada.

22:50.372 --> 22:52.957
- Why would they do that? 
- Because… that's where it's mother is.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.122
I'm sorry, I got no sleep last night. Davey cried forever,

22:56.378 --> 22:59.108
and I finally got him to sleep, and I must have fallen asleep with him.

22:59.168 --> 23:02.687
Sookie, I was counting on you. Now they have to reship it back here,

23:02.769 --> 23:05.943
- which means we have to repay the shipping fee. 
- Why didn't you call Michel?

23:06.040 --> 23:09.639
- I did. He couldn't come. 
- You want coffee? I am so tired.

23:09.997 --> 23:13.858
This is so typical. He's always complaining about not being included,

23:13.940 --> 23:16.418
and then he finally gets a chance, and he won't come.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.933
Sookie, Michel has a job. We're not paying him.

23:19.086 --> 23:21.881
- I know, but still. 
- Sookie, stop, turn, look.

23:22.993 --> 23:25.404
- What do you think of my hair? 
- Too much product?

23:25.580 --> 23:27.944
Sookie, for the past six weeks, I have taken every meeting.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.770
I have been at the inn round the clock - I haven't had a second for myself -

23:30.847 --> 23:35.297
and all I asked for was just one hour to get my hair done,

23:35.364 --> 23:38.107
and then two seconds into the shampoo I get a phone call from a guy

23:38.159 --> 23:40.985
who sounds like a "Kids in the Hall" character telling me I have to get to the inn

23:41.035 --> 23:44.195
to okay a sink that I wouldn't know how to okay because I don't know

23:44.261 --> 23:45.873
what makes it okay. You know what makes it okay,

23:45.929 --> 23:49.084
which is why you said you would be there to say whether or not it was okay.

23:49.176 --> 23:51.983
Look, I said I'm sorry I missed the meeting, but I have a baby here.

23:52.049 --> 23:54.419
Yes, I know, believe me, that's all I've heard about lately.

23:54.507 --> 23:58.026
- Well, excuse me for procreating. 
- We have a business we're trying to launch.

23:58.106 --> 23:59.652
- I missed a meeting. 
- Every meeting.

23:59.754 --> 24:02.135
- I said I'm sorry. 
- I don't need you to be sorry. I need you to be there.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.184
What do you want me to do? I have a baby.

24:04.287 --> 24:08.019
Sookie, we are drowning here. I wasn't supposed to have to do everything by myself.

24:08.091 --> 24:09.586
That's why I have a partner.

24:09.689 --> 24:12.858
I didn't know I was gonna be pregnant when we decided to open the inn.

24:12.940 --> 24:14.537
And if you'd known, we wouldn't be partners?

24:14.624 --> 24:18.397
No, I mean… Look, this isn't the stuff I'm supposed to help with, anyhow.

24:18.489 --> 24:21.147
- What are you talking about? 
- The planning, the decision making...

24:21.230 --> 24:24.655
I've never been any good at that. My part comes later, when we open the inn.

24:24.736 --> 24:27.086
- I need you before then. 
- I'm doing the best I can.

24:27.511 --> 24:29.903
Fine. I have to go.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.717
What are we gonna do about the sink?

24:38.689 --> 24:41.402
- Hey, Luke. 
- Lane, back in town, huh?

24:41.780 --> 24:45.297
- Well, yeah, as of today. 
- You're not staying with Rory anymore, huh?

24:45.503 --> 24:48.892
No, it was kind of time for me to move on, considering, you know, I don't actually go to Yale.

24:48.969 --> 24:50.274
- Yeah. 
- You need some help?

24:50.376 --> 24:52.578
- Nope, I'm good. 
- I've been waiting for ten minutes.

24:52.641 --> 24:54.218
Sorry, not even close to the record.

24:54.908 --> 24:58.560
Listen, I was wondering if I could maybe get my job back.

24:58.728 --> 25:01.805
I know it was wrong for me to take off like that. I totally left you in the lurch,

25:01.893 --> 25:04.288
and I'd be willing to work extra overtime hours for nothing

25:04.360 --> 25:06.710
- if you'd consider giving me another chance. 
- Sure.

25:07.079 --> 25:10.238
Really? Oh, my God, thank you, Luke. Should I start right now?

25:10.453 --> 25:12.543
- Yes.
- Your shift tonight will be fine.

25:12.614 --> 25:14.329
Okay, my shift tonight. I'll be here.

25:15.819 --> 25:20.992
- Lorelai. I really, really want to thank you. 
- Aww, you're very, very welcome.

25:21.343 --> 25:23.279
- For what? 
- For letting me stay with you.

25:23.509 --> 25:24.692
- You're staying with me? 
- Yes?

25:24.825 --> 25:26.295
- And I knew this? 
- Rory told you…

25:26.412 --> 25:28.266
Ha, ha, Rory told me, yeah.

25:28.378 --> 25:30.955
She did tell you, right? She said she was gonna call.

25:31.897 --> 25:34.482
- I guess you're staying with me. 
- Is that okay?

25:34.584 --> 25:37.538
- Yeah, its okay. Just make sure your mom knows. 
- Okay, I will. I'll see you at home.

25:37.733 --> 25:40.093
- Thanks, Luke, I'll see you later. 
- Oh, we'll be here.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.185
- Sit down, Ed. Pigs, gluttons. 
- Customers!

25:43.268 --> 25:46.124
- How could people eat this much? 
- Well, this is not all from one person, Luke.

25:46.222 --> 25:48.264
It's disgusting. It's making me sick to my stomach.

25:48.393 --> 25:50.917
Well then, have you ever thought that maybe you're in the wrong industry?

25:51.004 --> 25:53.990
I should get rid of the plates, make 'em all strap on a feed bag, you know,

25:54.056 --> 25:57.204
hang bells around their necks. Enter them in county fairs.

25:57.297 --> 25:58.879
Come again, soon. See ya!

25:59.381 --> 26:02.467
Listen, Luke, could you hit the pause button on the rant for just a sec?

26:02.525 --> 26:05.129
- What do you need? 
- I was wondering if we could have dinner tonight.

26:06.073 --> 26:08.432
- Dinner? 
- Yeah, I need to discuss something with you,

26:08.503 --> 26:11.121
and I thought maybe we could do it over dinner unless you and Nicole have...

26:11.182 --> 26:14.988
- She's in Boston this week. 
- Okay. Well, how about Silvano's, 8:00?

26:15.070 --> 26:18.787
- Why don't you just come here? I could make us some… 
- No, this isn't diner talk. It's more official.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.911
- Are you being drafted? 
- Yes, that's it.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.774
You have to wear a tie at Silvano's.

26:22.866 --> 26:25.192
No, just a jacket, and you can take it off the minute we sit down.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.889
- Okay, 8:00. 
- Okay, I'll see you there.

26:28.119 --> 26:30.168
- Love the hat. 
- Livin' on a prayer, baby.

26:48.007 --> 26:48.712
Hello, Lane.

26:49.419 --> 26:50.366
Hello, Mrs. Kim.

26:53.771 --> 26:55.220
I'm staying at Lorelai's.

26:56.234 --> 26:56.936
Wear socks.

26:59.516 --> 27:00.095
Okay.

27:01.385 --> 27:03.751
...and I'll return your call as soon as possible, thanks.

27:04.191 --> 27:06.910
So I'm on my way to my professor's office to ask him a question

27:07.026 --> 27:10.975
about his last lecture because my pen was giving out, and I can't read my own writing,

27:11.026 --> 27:14.216
which is not at all true. However, it will give him a perfect opportunity

27:14.287 --> 27:17.032
to discuss my paper with me since I'm sure he's graded it by now,

27:17.109 --> 27:20.488
and since I'm also sure I'm in for a big helping of "Nicely done, Miss Gilmore,

27:20.554 --> 27:21.916
how about an 'A'." Call me.

27:22.970 --> 27:23.571
Come in.

27:25.701 --> 27:30.205
Professor Gilbert? Hi, I'm Rory Gilmore. I'm in your Tuesday afternoon Game Theory class.

27:30.287 --> 27:31.936
- I hope I'm not disturbing you. 
- Come in.

27:32.619 --> 27:33.191
Thank you.

27:34.368 --> 27:37.149
I was wondering if I could go over a couple of things from your lecture the other day.

27:37.430 --> 27:42.981
Okay, well, I wrote something down here, but I cannot for the life of me read my own handwriting.

27:43.155 --> 27:46.513
Seriously, if I had this analyzed, Charlize Theron would be playing me in a movie…

27:47.639 --> 27:51.393
'Cause I'd be a serial killer, and pretty girls like to get fat and play serial killers

27:51.530 --> 27:55.279
'cause they win an Oscar and - I'm sorry, should I go on?

27:55.371 --> 27:58.643
Or you can just wait to let me find your paper so we can talk about why you're really here.

28:00.527 --> 28:01.571
Well, Okay.

28:02.211 --> 28:03.746
Rory Gilmore. Yes, here we are.

28:04.505 --> 28:08.796
Yes. Right. Okay. Good you came in.

28:09.488 --> 28:10.454
- It is? 
- Yes.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.937
Now, in this paper, you were supposed to use a real world example

28:14.029 --> 28:17.177
to compare and contrast classical economic theory and game theory, yes?

28:17.254 --> 28:20.531
Okay, now your paper dealt well enough with the game theory portion.

28:20.880 --> 28:25.252
However, you then diverged into a discussion on the pollution problem in Mexico City.

28:25.559 --> 28:28.611
Well, it felt to me like someone using knowledge from a different course

28:28.687 --> 28:31.539
to pad their paper and thereby avoid doing research for mine.

28:31.708 --> 28:34.073
Oh, no, I just...

28:34.206 --> 28:36.336
I've seen this happen before, particularly to freshmen.

28:36.721 --> 28:39.075
Usually, it just means that they're overloading themselves,

28:39.194 --> 28:42.307
that they don't fully understand the demands of a Yale academic curriculum.

28:42.460 --> 28:45.076
So, I took the liberty of looking over your schedule,

28:45.163 --> 28:49.101
- and I think that's what you've done. 
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine, really.

28:49.235 --> 28:52.731
I just have a little trouble with game theory, that's all. I blame my mother.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.923
She always made up the games at home when I was growing up.

28:55.004 --> 28:58.634
I begged her for Monopoly, but she insisted on "Mimic Your Favorite Sweat Hog", so…

28:58.706 --> 29:01.421
I talked with your advisor. She has the same concern that I do.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.891
- What concern is that? 
- You're taking too many courses this semester.

29:04.968 --> 29:06.822
- Your workload is too heavy. 
- I'll try harder.

29:06.893 --> 29:08.347
I think you should drop this course.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.455
You still have a couple of weeks left before the end of the drop period.

29:11.527 --> 29:13.953
You can take the course again when you have more time to devote to it.

29:14.038 --> 29:17.788
But, my grandfather took this same workload when he went here.

29:17.870 --> 29:19.852
Different people work at different paces.

29:20.052 --> 29:23.573
You shouldn't compare yourself to anyone else. You work at a slower pace.

29:23.677 --> 29:25.802
- I don't. I'm not… 
- The choice is ultimately yours.

29:26.042 --> 29:29.063
You can stay, but this is a "D" paper.

29:30.159 --> 29:31.311
This is not a big deal.

29:32.007 --> 29:33.989
This happens to a lot of students.

29:35.825 --> 29:38.679
Okay. Glad to be fitting in.

29:44.091 --> 29:46.035
- Hi. I'm Lore...
- Get in here right now.

29:46.292 --> 29:47.920
- My gran must be here. 
- Jersey, close the door

29:47.997 --> 29:49.993
- and get those nuts in the living room.
- Well... Ow.

29:50.091 --> 29:53.987
- I've been alone with that woman for over two hours now. 
- Real arm in the coat, Mom.

29:54.048 --> 29:56.595
- Your father's late. You're late. 
- I'm not late, just in pain.

29:56.691 --> 29:57.530
Get in the living room.

29:58.028 --> 30:00.342
- I can't arrive before the nuts. 
- Don't start with me.

30:01.361 --> 30:04.211
Here she is, Mom, Lorelai. The party just gets bigger.

30:04.356 --> 30:06.010
Hi, Gran, how are you doing? You look great.

30:06.311 --> 30:08.196
Emily, what is the matter with her hair?

30:09.009 --> 30:09.966
Oh, well...

30:10.376 --> 30:14.187
I know my granddaughter. If she had received proper notice of my arrival,

30:14.274 --> 30:17.037
- she would have done something about it. 
- I told her in plenty of time, Mom.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.307
She really did, Gran. I swear.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.937
I think it is admirable of you to cover for your mother.

30:22.025 --> 30:26.909
The importance of family loyalty simply cannot be measured. Sit, dear.

30:27.897 --> 30:30.452
Other than your hair, you look well. Are you well?

30:30.698 --> 30:33.601
Emily, perhaps the girl would like a drink.

30:35.126 --> 30:37.513
- I am very well. 
- Good. How is Rory?

30:37.666 --> 30:40.210
- She's just as healthy as I am. 
- And her hair is perfect.

30:40.319 --> 30:43.579
- And how is she doing at Yale? 
- She's doing great, studying her butt off.

30:43.673 --> 30:46.529
Oh, how charming to hear. I'm glad she's doing well.

30:46.631 --> 30:50.380
She is a Gilmore, after all. Gilmores have always excelled at Yale.

30:50.548 --> 30:54.915
- They have quite a legacy to live up to. 
- Well, your legacy is safe with her.

30:56.247 --> 31:01.352
- Mom, here are the nuts. 
- Oh, thank you, Emily, for that announcement.

31:01.516 --> 31:05.657
How wonderful that you don't need some sort of amplification system in order

31:05.730 --> 31:10.127
to make sure that everyone in the area is informed about the arrival of the nuts.

31:10.229 --> 31:10.963
I'm sorry.

31:11.535 --> 31:14.644
Strange woman, so excited about nuts.

31:14.772 --> 31:19.389
- I smell jasmine. 
- You smell impatience. Where have you been?

31:19.467 --> 31:20.951
You know very well where I've been.

31:21.269 --> 31:24.908
I had some work to get out of the way so I could devote my full attention to you.

31:25.006 --> 31:26.988
You look wonderful. Florida agrees with you.

31:27.106 --> 31:30.321
Florida agrees with muscle-bound men who dress like women.

31:30.403 --> 31:32.815
I am much happier to be back here where I belong.

31:32.927 --> 31:36.189
Would you like a nut? They seem to be very important to your wife.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.667
- I thought you liked those nuts, Mom. 
- I'm fine, Trix.

31:38.795 --> 31:40.608
I have someone I would like you to meet

31:41.549 --> 31:44.979
- Lorelai, have you been there the whole time? 
- Yes, I have.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.822
- Well, I didn't see you. 
- Well, I had my cloaking device activated, so...

31:48.467 --> 31:52.797
Trix, this is my partner, Jason Stiles. Jason, this is my mother.

31:52.901 --> 31:55.528
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Gilmore. 
- You are very young.

31:55.618 --> 31:59.593
- Oh, no, not so young. 
- I think I know if someone is young or not.

31:59.704 --> 32:02.955
- For God's sake, Jason, just be young. 
- Cloaking device, never leave home without it.

32:03.054 --> 32:08.542
- Richard Gilmore, you're growing a mustache. 
- I know, the Ferrari is arriving on Tuesday.

32:08.650 --> 32:10.564
- I like it. 
- Thank you, Trix.

32:10.677 --> 32:14.730
- It makes you look like Adolphe Menjou. 
- Or Adolphe Menjou's cocaine dealer.

32:16.165 --> 32:16.898
What is that?

32:17.626 --> 32:20.154
Well, actually, this is a little present that I got for you.

32:20.236 --> 32:21.358
- For me? 
- Yes.

32:21.721 --> 32:23.527
- Why would you give me a present? 
- Well...

32:23.779 --> 32:26.108
- It's not my birthday. It's not Christmas. 
- Yes, but...

32:26.208 --> 32:30.056
- You don't even know me. 
- No, but you're Richard's mother, so I thought...

32:30.123 --> 32:33.549
What is it? What is this present that you got for an old woman you've never met?

32:35.735 --> 32:37.639
- It's a book. 
- What sort of book?

32:37.803 --> 32:39.723
It's a book on French antiques.

32:41.311 --> 32:44.920
- I heard you liked French antiques. 
- I do like French antiques.

32:46.400 --> 32:47.844
You can just open it later.

32:50.890 --> 32:53.775
Absolutely not -- I am company.

32:54.008 --> 32:58.361
You don't answer the phone when you have company, so put it away and turn it off.

32:58.893 --> 32:59.728
Yes, Gran.

32:59.985 --> 33:03.915
Now, shall we all take turns guessing how long it will be

33:03.972 --> 33:08.042
before lunch is served? I will say an hour. Richard?

33:08.109 --> 33:09.507
You are bad, Trix.

33:10.813 --> 33:13.255
Hi, this is Lorelai Gilmore, and you've reached my cell phone.

33:13.311 --> 33:14.765
Leave a message, and I'll return your call.

33:21.345 --> 33:24.150
- Hey, you on the phone? 
- No, I'm just checking my messages.

33:24.283 --> 33:25.399
Anything important?

33:26.289 --> 33:28.779
- No, just a hang up. 
- Good, good.

33:29.690 --> 33:31.180
You know, I should get a globe.

33:32.389 --> 33:35.244
Every time you see a movie, and there's a really important character,

33:35.296 --> 33:38.071
and then you go into that character's office, they always have a globe.

33:38.368 --> 33:42.685
- You're hiding from my grandmother, aren't you? 
- She is scarier than Nick Nolte's mug shot.

33:42.756 --> 33:43.330
Come on.

33:43.525 --> 33:45.583
Please, she's just gonna ask me why I got her a present again.

33:48.536 --> 33:51.537
We have decided to just go sit at the table.

33:51.794 --> 33:54.993
Perhaps the food will appear by sheer wish fulfillment.

33:55.265 --> 33:57.507
- I'll check on it again, Mom. 
- Oh, please don't.

33:57.610 --> 34:01.517
I wouldn't want to disturb your cook. She's obviously in the middle of a crossword puzzle.

34:02.714 --> 34:06.661
- Lorelai, where did you go? 
- Sorry, Gran. I had to check my messages.

34:06.744 --> 34:10.692
- I've got all this construction going on at the inn. 
- Yes, your inn.

34:10.891 --> 34:13.590
- Have you seen this inn of hers? 
- No, not yet.

34:13.666 --> 34:15.806
No, it's a mess right now. You'll all see it when it's done.

34:15.898 --> 34:17.235
- And when will that be? 
- Soon.

34:17.331 --> 34:20.799
- I see you measure time like your mother. 
- Just let me check on lunch, please?

34:20.926 --> 34:24.371
So tell me, Lorelai. How much money have you invested in this inn?

34:24.500 --> 34:25.402
Oh, a chunk.

34:25.503 --> 34:30.291
And I assume that you have a projected timetable for getting your chunk back out?

34:30.367 --> 34:33.014
Well, if everything goes as planned, we're hoping to break even the first year

34:33.112 --> 34:36.292
- and turn a profit the second year. 
- That's optimistic, yes?

34:36.380 --> 34:38.693
Yes, but our town has a pretty regular tourist trade.

34:38.806 --> 34:41.902
You know, small inns and bed and breakfasts can be real money factories.

34:41.995 --> 34:44.918
Yes, and wonderful places to put all those French antiques.

34:45.036 --> 34:48.478
Well, we have very high hopes, and we booked our first reservation.

34:48.842 --> 34:50.516
- When is the reservation? 
- May 8th.

34:50.621 --> 34:52.466
- Really? That soon? 
- You'll be ready by then?

34:52.583 --> 34:55.445
Well, we'll have to be. We had to add some extra construction guys,

34:55.531 --> 34:58.151
and we'll have to get the sink back from Canada, but we'll finish in time.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.042
- How is the money holding up? 
- Excuse me?

35:01.139 --> 35:04.764
The money. I was somewhat aware of your financial situation

35:04.852 --> 35:07.222
before you took this on. How much do you have left?

35:07.320 --> 35:08.922
Plenty. Enough to finish.

35:11.942 --> 35:13.743
- You're in trouble. 
- No.

35:13.868 --> 35:17.328
You are hemorrhaging money. I see it in your eyes.

35:17.630 --> 35:23.284
It must be costing a fortune to get a contractor to stick to a projected completion date.

35:23.620 --> 35:27.123
And you're not working now. Unless your partner is a Rockefeller,

35:27.231 --> 35:29.560
you are in serious financial trouble.

35:29.642 --> 35:31.982
Mom, I don't think this is the best time to discuss this.

35:32.101 --> 35:35.187
Well, if we were eating, we would have something else to do, but since we're not...

35:35.397 --> 35:37.958
- How could you let this happen? 
- How could I let this happen?

35:38.039 --> 35:41.249
She is your daughter. It is your responsibility to know

35:41.336 --> 35:43.605
when she is in deep financial trouble.

35:43.712 --> 35:47.449
- I'm not in deep financial trouble. 
- Trix, Lorelai is a grown woman.

35:47.532 --> 35:49.605
Ridiculous. This is a family.

35:49.713 --> 35:53.692
It is a family's responsibility to make sure that this doesn't happen.

35:53.773 --> 35:55.873
We have a reputation to uphold.

35:55.944 --> 35:59.851
How would it look if a Gilmore goes out into the business world and fails?

35:59.922 --> 36:03.212
- I hardly think she's failing, Mom. 
- Well, she looks like she's failing to me.

36:03.617 --> 36:07.721
And I am surprised at you. After all, I helped you out

36:07.778 --> 36:09.778
- when you had financial problems. 
- Trix!

36:09.871 --> 36:13.758
You made that terrible investment in Dubliners Paper Corporation

36:13.859 --> 36:17.008
when you were first married. I told you not to, but you wouldn't listen,

36:17.079 --> 36:21.233
- and of course, I had to step in and bail you out. 
- Now, hold on here, Trix.

36:21.299 --> 36:24.790
- You would have lost this house if it weren't for me. 
- That is not true.

36:24.867 --> 36:27.913
It is not true that you pigheadedly lost that money?

36:28.006 --> 36:31.288
I was twenty-seven years old. That is the time to take risks.

36:31.375 --> 36:34.770
Well, when you have my money to bail you out, taking risks is not much of a problem, is it?

36:34.846 --> 36:37.319
- You're making me sound like an incompetent child. 
- Oh, please.

36:37.391 --> 36:42.014
I have built two extremely successful businesses, Mother, and both of them without your help.

36:42.127 --> 36:44.979
And I do not appreciate you now, many years later,

36:45.025 --> 36:48.450
throwing in my face the fact that you once helped me out financially!

36:48.523 --> 36:52.101
- Do not raise your voice to me. 
- I will raise my voice if the situation warrants it!

36:52.228 --> 36:53.426
Oh, no, not now.

36:53.986 --> 36:57.134
- You paid that money back in two months, also. 
- That's right, two months.

36:57.235 --> 37:01.610
How deep in financial ruin could I have been to get that money back to you in two months?

37:01.712 --> 37:04.122
- I'm leaving this table. 
- Let me help you with your chair.

37:08.173 --> 37:12.111
- Hey, Tom, is my mom here? 
- I haven't seen her. She could be inside.

37:12.412 --> 37:16.498
She sometimes slips in the back door, likes to surprise a bunch of guys with nail guns.

37:16.902 --> 37:17.506
Thanks.

37:19.730 --> 37:20.359
Mom?

37:23.722 --> 37:25.201
Rory. Hey.

37:25.652 --> 37:26.615
Do you know where my mom is?

37:27.128 --> 37:31.372
- No, did you check outside? 
- Yeah, I did. She's not there.

37:31.611 --> 37:33.717
- She's not at home. She's not anywhere. 
- Are you okay?

37:33.978 --> 37:37.641
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just - I can't find her. 
- Well, maybe she's at Sookie's.

37:37.753 --> 37:41.116
- Sookie's? Okay, I can try Sookie's.
- Rory, what's wrong?

37:41.214 --> 37:43.677
Nothing. Nothing's wrong. I'm fine, I'm good.

37:43.753 --> 37:46.692
I'm just having some technical difficulties. Get it?

37:46.758 --> 37:49.799
- Technical difficulties? Very funny, eh? 
- Yeah, it's very funny.

37:49.871 --> 37:52.994
I know, I am very funny, and I am getting funnier. Yale is doing that to me.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.046
I am just -- it's really developing, the hilarity. Where are we going?

37:56.148 --> 37:57.341
- Outside. 
- Outside?

37:57.439 --> 37:59.338
Sure, 'cause I'm used to working a bigger room.

38:01.023 --> 38:02.845
- What's wrong? 
- Nothing.

38:03.285 --> 38:05.958
- What's wrong? 
- Everything's falling apart.

38:06.895 --> 38:10.739
- I thought I had it all under control, but I don't. 
- What? What was under control?

38:11.263 --> 38:15.103
Everybody else can handle the classes, but I can't.

38:15.297 --> 38:17.882
And I'm supposed to. I'm supposed to take five classes.

38:18.118 --> 38:21.165
Everybody else does. I mean, my grandfather did.

38:21.631 --> 38:25.537
God, how am I gonna tell my grandfather that I failed?

38:25.736 --> 38:26.556
You failed?

38:27.160 --> 38:29.142
No, I didn't even get a chance to fail. I mean...

38:29.945 --> 38:33.837
- I had to drop a class. I was told to drop a class. 
- That's not a big deal.

38:34.113 --> 38:37.165
It's a really big deal. I'm not supposed to drop a class.

38:37.242 --> 38:40.001
I'm not the drop-a-class person. I get good grades.

38:40.089 --> 38:43.104
- I… handle things. 
- Hey, come on.

38:45.147 --> 38:48.402
And Lane, she's not around anymore, and I...

38:49.591 --> 38:54.359
I know she had to go, but I miss her, and I liked her there,

38:54.470 --> 39:00.696
and I haven't talked to my mom, and I need to talk to her, and she's not around.

39:01.747 --> 39:05.401
And I'm failing. I'm failing everything. I can't do it. I can't handle it.

39:06.708 --> 39:08.161
I'm messing everything up!

39:12.760 --> 39:17.372
- Oh! God, just look at this. 
- Look at what?

39:17.808 --> 39:22.518
You having to be nice to me. I mean, you shouldn't have to be nice to me.

39:22.615 --> 39:26.046
I was horrible to you, and now you're married to someone nice

39:26.149 --> 39:30.855
- and who's not me and not a failure. 
- You are so not a failure.

39:30.941 --> 39:32.145
Yes, I am.

39:32.917 --> 39:34.561
I just can't, I...

39:35.830 --> 39:39.841
I need to talk to my mom 'cause I just don't know what to do.

39:41.443 --> 39:42.426
It's okay.

39:49.379 --> 39:50.018
Luke.

39:50.417 --> 39:51.789
- Hey, I was just coming to meet you. 
- I know.

39:51.991 --> 39:53.183
Could we...

39:54.443 --> 39:58.404
I need to... I'm sorry, I need to reschedule our dinner.

39:58.532 --> 40:00.837
- Oh sure. 
- Yeah, I'm just very tired.

40:01.124 --> 40:03.443
So I'm sorry that I made you get all dressed up.

40:03.551 --> 40:05.819
That's okay, it's good for me to do it every once in awhile.

40:05.892 --> 40:08.210
- It reminds me why I'm not an accountant. 
- Okay.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.950
- Everything okay? 
- What?

40:10.192 --> 40:11.605
- Are you okay? 
- Why?

40:11.799 --> 40:16.059
- Because you don't look okay. 
- Well, geez, take me now, sailor.

40:16.305 --> 40:20.370
- I mean, you look distracted. 
- Distracted, no. Well, maybe -- yeah.

40:20.445 --> 40:24.681
- Distracted, okay, sure. I'm very distracted. 
- Anything I can do?

40:26.160 --> 40:30.245
You know, there are very few times in my life when I find myself sitting around thinking,

40:30.359 --> 40:36.918
"I wish I was married," but today, I mean -- I'm happy. You know?

40:37.051 --> 40:41.275
I like my life. I like my friends. I like my stuff.

40:42.243 --> 40:45.411
My time, my space, my TV.

40:46.042 --> 40:46.805
Yeah, sure.

40:47.864 --> 40:51.873
But every now and then, just for a moment,

40:52.662 --> 40:53.911
I wish I had a partner,

40:55.145 --> 40:59.627
someone to pick up the slack. Someone to wait for the cable guy,

41:00.199 --> 41:03.434
make me coffee in the morning, meet the stupid sink

41:03.541 --> 41:06.691
before it gets sent back to Canada.

41:07.018 --> 41:07.740
What happened?

41:11.806 --> 41:18.258
I just thought I had everything under control, but I didn't, and the inn is just falling apart.

41:18.354 --> 41:26.157
This has been my dream forever, and I have it, and it's here, and I'm failing.

41:26.244 --> 41:31.908
I can't handle it. I just spend every minute running around and working and thinking.

41:31.995 --> 41:35.680
And I thought I would have help, but Sookie has Davey, and Michel has Celine,

41:35.742 --> 41:37.852
and I'm -- I can't do it all by myself.

41:38.271 --> 41:42.137
And I don't even have time to see my kid, and hell, forget see her, just even talk to her.

41:42.209 --> 41:45.440
And I miss her. And I sat there in my parents' house

41:45.495 --> 41:49.392
just listening to my grandmother basically call me a charity case,

41:49.469 --> 41:52.597
and I couldn't even argue with her. I couldn't even say anything,

41:52.849 --> 41:55.895
because I am. I'm running out of money, and I don't know what to do about it,

41:55.966 --> 41:59.693
and I was gonna, I was gonna ask you for $30,000 at dinner tonight.

42:00.344 --> 42:03.159
- That's how pathetic I am. 
- Thirty thousand dollars.

42:03.358 --> 42:06.268
- Well, okay, I mean if you... 
- I don't want to talk about it now.

42:06.651 --> 42:07.619
I don't want to think about it.

42:10.497 --> 42:11.362
I'm failing.

42:12.253 --> 42:17.455
- I'm failing. 
- You are not failing.

42:17.987 --> 42:20.978
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.

42:24.193 --> 42:26.409
- I don't know what to do. 
- It's okay.

42:33.321 --> 42:36.727
Hi, hon. I'm just seeing if I could catch you, but you're out.

42:36.926 --> 42:41.903
So... nothing much to report here. Just give me a call when you can.

42:43.700 --> 42:46.623
Just checking in. Nothing big to report.

42:47.801 --> 42:50.828
Okay, give me a call when you can. Bye, mom.
