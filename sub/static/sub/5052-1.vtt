00:13.806 --> 00:17.308
Cinderella

00:17.393 --> 00:20.853
You're as lovely as your name

00:20.938 --> 00:24.023
Cinderella

00:24.108 --> 00:28.653
You're a sunset in a frame

00:28.737 --> 00:31.531
Though you're dressed in rags

00:31.615 --> 00:36.536
You wear an air of queenly grace

00:36.662 --> 00:38.996
Anyone can see

00:39.081 --> 00:44.711
A throne would be your proper place

00:45.295 --> 00:48.047
Cinderella

00:48.132 --> 00:51.551
If you give your heart a chance

00:51.635 --> 00:54.679
It will lead you

00:54.763 --> 00:59.100
To the kingdom of romance

00:59.935 --> 01:05.397
There you'll see your dreams unfold

01:07.526 --> 01:09.526
Cinderella

01:14.116 --> 01:16.868
In the sweetest story

01:16.952 --> 01:21.247
Ever told

01:36.597 --> 01:40.141
Once upon a time,
in a faraway land,

01:40.225 --> 01:42.185
there was a tiny kingdom,

01:44.146 --> 01:48.149
peaceful, prosperous,
and rich in romance and tradition.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.489
Here, in a stately chateau,

01:54.573 --> 01:56.449
there lived a widowed gentleman

01:56.533 --> 01:58.785
and his little daughter, Cinderella.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.539
Although he was
a kind and devoted father,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.793
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

02:06.877 --> 02:10.086
still, he felt she needed
a mother's care.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.923
And so, he married again,

02:12.007 --> 02:15.593
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family,

02:15.677 --> 02:18.429
with two daughters
just Cinderella's age,

02:18.514 --> 02:22.183
by name, Anastasia and Drizella.

02:24.728 --> 02:28.064
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.983
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.653
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous

02:33.737 --> 02:35.738
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

02:35.823 --> 02:38.407
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests

02:38.492 --> 02:40.493
of her own two awkward daughters.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.957
Thus, as time went by,

02:46.041 --> 02:48.209
the chateau fell into disrepair.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.294
For the family fortunes
were squandered

02:50.379 --> 02:52.755
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

02:52.840 --> 02:56.092
while Cinderella was abused,
humiliated,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.637
and finally forced
to become a servant in her own house.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.558
And yet, through it all,

03:03.642 --> 03:07.270
Cinderella remained
ever gentle and kind.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.898
For with each dawn,
she found new hope that someday

03:10.983 --> 03:13.442
her dreams of happiness
would come true.

03:54.610 --> 03:57.737
Well, it serves you right,
spoiling people's best dreams.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.490
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning,

04:01.575 --> 04:04.201
but it was a lovely dream, too.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.958
What kind of a dream?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.210
Can't tell.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.175
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.426
And, after all...

04:20.844 --> 04:25.389
A dream is a wish

04:25.515 --> 04:29.727
Your heart makes

04:29.811 --> 04:35.524
When you're fast asleep

04:35.609 --> 04:39.695
In dreams you will lose

04:39.780 --> 04:42.114
Your heartaches

04:43.659 --> 04:47.703
Whatever you wish for

04:47.788 --> 04:48.996
You keep

04:51.792 --> 04:53.584
Have faith

04:53.669 --> 04:59.507
In your dreams and someday

05:00.175 --> 05:06.847
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

05:07.933 --> 05:13.354
No matter how your heart is grieving

05:14.523 --> 05:18.776
If you keep on believing

05:19.987 --> 05:23.948
The dream that you wish

05:24.032 --> 05:29.412
Will come true

05:31.123 --> 05:32.748
Oh, that clock.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.584
Old killjoy.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.255
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.675
Time to start another day.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.969
Even he orders me around.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.347
Well, there's one thing.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.809
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.729
And perhaps someday...

05:54.813 --> 05:58.649
The dreams that I wish

05:58.734 --> 06:04.030
Will come true

07:09.429 --> 07:15.059
No matter how your heart is grieving

07:16.019 --> 07:20.648
If you keep on believing

07:21.900 --> 07:25.152
The dream that you wish

07:25.237 --> 07:30.449
Will come true

07:30.534 --> 07:33.285
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.412
Wait a minute.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.206
One at a time, please.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.959
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.377
New mouse in the house.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.337
Brand-new. Never saw it before.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.006
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.551
Well, she'll need a dress...

07:50.053 --> 07:52.138
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.932
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.936
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!

07:59.020 --> 08:01.063
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.691
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.583
Now, now, calm down, everybody.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.421
Oh, the poor little thing's
scared to death.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.382
Jaq, maybe you better
explain things to him.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.801
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.

08:30.886 --> 08:33.554
Now, now. Look, little guy.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.390
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.143
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.895
She's nice, very nice.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.356
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.400
Zuk, zuk.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.905
Well, that's better.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.118
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

08:58.079 --> 09:01.165
It is a little snug.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.042
But it'll have to do.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.085
Now, for a name.

09:05.837 --> 09:08.923
I've got one. Octavius.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.425
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.011
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?

09:14.095 --> 09:16.096
Gus-Gus.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.058
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.852
And don't forget
to warn him about the cat.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.813
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.440
Cat, cat?

09:26.524 --> 09:28.817
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.528
Meany, sneaky.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.614
Jump at you. Bite at you.

09:33.698 --> 09:37.368
Big, big. Big as a house.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.869
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?

09:39.371 --> 09:41.247
Lucify, zuk, zuk.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.905
Here, kitty, kitty.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.369
Come, kitty. Come on.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.667
Lucifer! Come here!

10:44.686 --> 10:48.314
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.775
It's certainly not my idea
to feed you first.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.154
It's orders. Come on.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.907
Lucify. Is that Lucify?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.743
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.

11:02.287 --> 11:07.291
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.667
No, Gus-Gus, no.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.961
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.755
Lucify mean.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.479
Bruno.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.607
Bruno!

11:38.573 --> 11:40.366
Dreaming again.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.910
Chasing Lucifer?

11:42.994 --> 11:45.871
Catch him this time? That's bad.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.168
Suppose they heard you upstairs.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.836
You know the orders.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.548
So if you don't want
to lose that nice, warm bed,

11:56.633 --> 11:59.176
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.011
Know how?

12:02.597 --> 12:04.348
Just learn to like cats.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.854
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.

12:10.939 --> 12:12.898
For one thing, he...

12:15.610 --> 12:18.862
Well, sometimes he...

12:21.282 --> 12:23.534
There must be
something good about him.

12:37.048 --> 12:38.882
Bruno!

12:38.967 --> 12:41.051
Oh, Bruno.

12:41.136 --> 12:44.096
Come on, now. Outside.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.309
I know it isn't easy,

12:49.394 --> 12:52.563
but at least we should try
to get along together.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.526
And that includes you, Your Majesty.

13:05.410 --> 13:09.246
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.416
Come on, everybody,
breakfast, breakfast.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.751
Come on, let's eat breakfast.

13:14.836 --> 13:18.005
Breakfast? Breakfast!

13:30.393 --> 13:32.227
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.107
Let's see.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.861
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.114
Now, somebody's got to sneak out,

13:44.199 --> 13:45.741
get Lucify to chase him,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.994
run over to the corner
and keep Lucify there.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.829
Then we all run out. Zuk.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.498
Yuk, yuk. Out.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.168
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.920
- Hop.
- Hop.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.630
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.881
Hop.

14:01.883 --> 14:04.259
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.053
Hop.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.871
Oh, there you are.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.748
I was wondering.

15:57.832 --> 16:00.417
All right. Breakfast is served.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.140
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.020
Let go! Let go, now.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.733
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.860
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

16:28.571 --> 16:30.197
Poor little Gus.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.032
Here.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.617
Help yourself.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.428
Where's Gus-Gus?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.472
Well, guess he got away.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.910
Cinderella!

18:41.496 --> 18:44.247
All right, all right. I'm coming.

18:44.332 --> 18:47.167
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.503
Cinderella!

18:49.587 --> 18:51.129
Coming, coming.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.184
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.947
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.324
Cinderella!

20:12.712 --> 20:15.171
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.090
As if you care.

20:17.174 --> 20:19.509
Take that ironing
and have it back in an hour.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.469
One hour, you hear?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.054
Yes, Drizella.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.564
Good morning, Anastasia.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.649
Well, it's about time.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.902
Don't forget the mending.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.362
Don't be all day getting it done, either.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.740
Yes, Anastasia.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.786
Well, come in, child, come in.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.204
Good morning, Stepmother.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.041
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.709
Yes, Stepmother.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.894
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!

21:10.978 --> 21:13.063
Mother! Mother!

21:13.147 --> 21:15.106
You did it. You did it on purpose.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.567
Mother! Mother! Mother!

21:17.652 --> 21:20.070
Now what did you do?

21:20.154 --> 21:21.571
She put it there.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.908
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.245
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.457
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.542
We'll just see about this.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.087
Come on. Let him go.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.089
Now the other one.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.423
Come on!

21:40.925 --> 21:43.343
Oh, poor little Gus.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.184
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?

21:51.268 --> 21:52.936
Cinderella!

21:53.020 --> 21:54.646
Yes, Stepmother.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.069
Are you gonna get it.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.947
Close the door, Cinderella.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.997
Come here.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.180
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.725
Now,

22:34.145 --> 22:36.396
it seems we have time on our hands.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.648
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!

22:41.861 --> 22:44.195
Time for vicious practical jokes.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.324
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.076
Now, let me see...

22:51.537 --> 22:54.372
There's the large carpet
in the main hall.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.374
Clean it!

22:56.459 --> 22:59.502
And the windows, upstairs and down.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.004
Wash them!

23:02.256 --> 23:06.009
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.595
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!

23:09.013 --> 23:11.431
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.350
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.

23:14.435 --> 23:18.480
And, of course, there's the mending and
the sewing and the laundry.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.778
Oh, yes. And one more thing.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.490
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

23:48.260 --> 23:51.471
My son has been avoiding his
responsibilities long enough.

23:51.555 --> 23:54.849
It's high time he married
and settled down.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.435
Of course, Your Majesty.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.229
But we must be patient.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.523
I am patient!

24:03.400 --> 24:07.278
But I'm not getting any younger,
you know.

24:07.363 --> 24:10.573
I want to see my grandchildren
before I go.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.409
- I understand, Sire.
- No.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.831
No, you don't know
what it means to see your only child

24:17.915 --> 24:22.794
grow farther, farther,
and farther away from you.

24:24.046 --> 24:25.296
I'm...

24:25.381 --> 24:28.508
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.760
I... I want to hear

24:30.845 --> 24:34.347
the pitter-patter of little feet again.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.517
Now, now, Your Majesty.

24:39.061 --> 24:42.355
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?

24:43.732 --> 24:46.317
With his silly romantic ideas?

24:46.402 --> 24:49.279
But, Sire, in matters of love...

24:49.363 --> 24:50.989
Love.

24:51.073 --> 24:55.618
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.496
So, we're arranging the conditions.

24:58.581 --> 25:01.374
But, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.251
Suspect!

25:03.335 --> 25:06.087
Look, the boy's coming home today,
isn't he?

25:06.172 --> 25:07.130
Yes, Sire.

25:07.214 --> 25:11.342
Well, what could be more natural than a
ball to celebrate his return?

25:11.427 --> 25:13.303
Nothing, Sire.

25:13.387 --> 25:17.348
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just

25:19.018 --> 25:20.727
happened to be there,

25:20.811 --> 25:25.064
why, he's bound to show interest
in one of them, isn't he?

25:25.149 --> 25:26.816
Isn't he?

25:26.901 --> 25:28.484
Yes, Sire.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.069
The moment he does...

25:30.988 --> 25:33.406
Soft lights.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.075
Romantic music.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.578
All the trimmings!

25:39.496 --> 25:41.414
It can't possibly fail.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.042
Can it?

25:44.668 --> 25:46.628
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!

25:46.712 --> 25:49.005
Very well, Sire.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.757
I shall arrange the ball for...

25:50.841 --> 25:53.384
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!

25:53.469 --> 25:55.094
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!

25:55.179 --> 25:58.640
And see that every
eligible maid is there.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.184
Understand?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.104
Yes, Your Majesty.

26:06.982 --> 26:09.108
The pear-shaped toad

26:11.737 --> 26:18.826
Sing, sweet nightingale

26:18.911 --> 26:21.955
High

26:22.039 --> 26:24.874
Above me

26:24.959 --> 26:29.045
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

26:29.129 --> 26:32.298
Sing, sweet nightingale

26:32.383 --> 26:36.302
High

26:36.387 --> 26:40.390
Above

26:40.474 --> 26:43.893
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

26:43.978 --> 26:47.772
Sing, sweet nightingale

26:47.856 --> 26:49.456
High

26:55.322 --> 26:59.242
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

26:59.326 --> 27:02.787
Sing, sweet

27:02.871 --> 27:06.582
Nightingale

27:06.667 --> 27:11.629
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

27:11.714 --> 27:16.009
Sing, sweet

27:16.093 --> 27:20.305
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

27:20.389 --> 27:23.057
Sing

27:24.852 --> 27:29.105
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

27:29.189 --> 27:34.193
Oh, sing, sweet

27:35.154 --> 27:37.488
Oh

27:38.073 --> 27:41.326
Sing

27:42.286 --> 27:44.620
Lucifer!

27:47.541 --> 27:49.250
You mean old thing.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.379
I'm just going to have to
teach you a lesson.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.383
Open in the name of the King.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.596
An urgent message
from His Imperial Majesty.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.349
- Thank you.
- From the King!

28:04.433 --> 28:06.559
What's it say, Cinderelly?

28:06.643 --> 28:07.935
What's it say?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.479
I don't know.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.689
He said it's urgent.

28:13.817 --> 28:16.444
Maybe I should interrupt
the music lesson.

28:16.528 --> 28:22.617
Sing, sweet nightingale

28:22.701 --> 28:24.301
High

28:29.583 --> 28:31.918
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.755
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember,

28:35.839 --> 28:38.091
above all, self-control.

28:40.135 --> 28:41.344
Yes!

28:42.971 --> 28:45.515
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...

28:45.599 --> 28:48.476
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!

28:48.560 --> 28:50.061
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.480
I'll read it.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.733
Well, there's to be a ball.

28:55.818 --> 28:58.486
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.987
Oh, the Prince!

29:00.072 --> 29:02.281
And, by royal command,

29:02.366 --> 29:05.368
every eligible maiden is to attend.

29:05.452 --> 29:07.870
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.708
That means I can go, too.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.837
Her, dancing with the Prince.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.089
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.925
Would you mind holding my broom?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.305
Well, why not?

29:27.641 --> 29:30.435
After all, I'm still a
member of the family.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.396
And it says, "By royal command",

29:33.480 --> 29:36.190
"every eligible maiden is to attend."

29:36.275 --> 29:39.026
Yes, so it does.

29:40.737 --> 29:43.906
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.

29:43.991 --> 29:46.325
If you get all your work done.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.202
Oh, I will. I promise.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.873
And if you can find
something suitable to wear.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.293
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.921
Mother, do you realise
what you just said?

29:59.006 --> 30:00.673
Of course.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.509
I said "if."

30:03.594 --> 30:06.304
Oh. "If."

30:15.481 --> 30:16.939
Isn't it lovely?

30:17.024 --> 30:19.692
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.

30:19.776 --> 30:24.363
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned,
but I'll fix that.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.325
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.

30:27.951 --> 30:30.620
There ought to be
some good ideas in here.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.331
This one.

30:33.415 --> 30:34.749
Oh, very nice. Nice.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.584
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.629
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,

30:39.713 --> 30:42.590
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!

30:43.217 --> 30:45.009
Oh, now what do they want?

30:45.093 --> 30:46.427
Cinderella!

30:47.804 --> 30:48.971
Oh, well.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.015
I guess my dress will just have to wait.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.393
Cinderella!

30:54.478 --> 30:56.938
All right, all right. I'm coming.

31:00.234 --> 31:02.318
Poor Cinderelly.

31:02.402 --> 31:06.072
Every time she finds a minute,
that's the time when they begin it.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.074
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.951
Cinderella!

31:11.662 --> 31:14.997
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly

31:15.082 --> 31:17.041
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast

31:17.125 --> 31:18.918
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'

31:19.002 --> 31:20.962
And the sweepin' and the dustin'

31:21.046 --> 31:22.755
They always keep her hoppin'

31:22.839 --> 31:24.298
She'd go around in circles

31:24.383 --> 31:26.217
Till she's very, very dizzy

31:26.301 --> 31:30.763
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly

31:30.847 --> 31:32.932
Yeah. Keep her busy.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.436
You know what?

31:37.521 --> 31:40.606
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?

31:40.691 --> 31:42.441
- Not go?
- What did you say?

31:43.068 --> 31:46.612
You'll see. They'll fix her.

31:47.739 --> 31:52.118
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.829
Poor Cinderelly.

31:56.665 --> 31:58.624
Hey! We can do it!

31:58.709 --> 32:00.793
We can do it
We can do it

32:00.877 --> 32:04.380
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty

32:04.464 --> 32:06.215
There's nothing to it, really

32:06.300 --> 32:10.052
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it

32:10.137 --> 32:13.556
When dancing at the ball
she'll be more beautiful than all

32:13.640 --> 32:17.268
In the lovely dress
we make for Cinderelly

32:17.394 --> 32:18.978
Hurry, hurry, hurry

32:19.062 --> 32:20.813
Gonna help our Cinderelly

32:20.897 --> 32:22.648
Got no time to dilly-dally

32:22.733 --> 32:24.567
We got to get it goin'

32:24.651 --> 32:26.527
I'll cut it with the scissors.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.195
And I can do the sewing.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.323
Leave the sewing to the women.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.907
You go get some trimmin'.

32:31.992 --> 32:35.911
And we'll make
a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo

32:35.996 --> 32:38.748
We'll make a lovely dress
for Cinderelly

32:38.832 --> 32:41.125
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.628
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.589
Cinderelly will be surprised.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.924
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.977
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...

33:00.062 --> 33:02.438
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

33:02.522 --> 33:05.858
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?

33:05.942 --> 33:07.735
- Yes?
- When you're through,

33:07.819 --> 33:10.613
and before you begin
your regular chores,

33:10.697 --> 33:12.448
I have a few little things.

33:12.532 --> 33:13.783
Very well.

33:13.867 --> 33:17.286
I don't see why everyone else
has nice things to wear,

33:17.371 --> 33:19.455
and I always end up in these old rags.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.458
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.794
You should talk. These beads!

33:24.878 --> 33:26.212
I am sick of looking at them.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.923
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.637
Come on and be careful.

33:34.721 --> 33:38.057
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.027
We can use that, Gus-Gus.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.154
Pretty, pretty.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.448
Look out. Lucify!

34:41.079 --> 34:42.871
Beads!

34:42.956 --> 34:45.416
Very pretty beads!

36:49.541 --> 36:53.168
A dream is a wish your heart makes

36:53.253 --> 36:57.172
When you're fast asleep

36:57.257 --> 37:00.885
In dreams you will lose
your heartaches

37:00.969 --> 37:04.263
Whatever you wish for
You keep

37:14.441 --> 37:16.942
No matter how your heart is grieving

37:17.152 --> 37:18.861
If you keep on believing

37:18.945 --> 37:21.906
The dream that you wish will come true

37:34.794 --> 37:37.421
Okay. One, two, three, four,

37:37.505 --> 37:39.423
five, six, seven, eight.

37:41.176 --> 37:44.595
Whatever you wish for you keep

37:46.306 --> 37:47.848
All right.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.227
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.

37:52.312 --> 37:53.687
Heave, ho.

37:56.983 --> 38:00.110
The dream that you wish will come true

38:00.195 --> 38:02.488
Will come true

39:02.841 --> 39:05.175
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.554
Why, Cinderella,

39:08.638 --> 39:11.390
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.977
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

39:15.812 --> 39:18.397
But, of course, there will be other times.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.107
Yes. Good night.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.995
Oh, well.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.913
What's a royal ball?

39:36.833 --> 39:39.918
After all, I suppose
it would be frightfully dull,

39:40.003 --> 39:43.505
and boring, and completely...

39:44.257 --> 39:46.216
Completely wonderful.

39:54.434 --> 39:56.393
- It's my...
- Surprise!

39:56.478 --> 39:58.312
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

39:59.731 --> 40:01.857
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!

40:01.941 --> 40:04.359
Well, I never dreamed it.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.029
It's such a surprise.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.616
Oh, how can I ever...

40:11.326 --> 40:13.744
Oh, thank you so much.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.378
Remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

40:23.463 --> 40:25.130
- be sure...
- Wait!

40:26.132 --> 40:27.925
Please, wait for me.

40:28.802 --> 40:32.054
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?

40:32.138 --> 40:34.014
Do you think it will do?

40:36.059 --> 40:37.768
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.020
- Oh, no.
- You can't!

40:40.105 --> 40:41.522
Girls, please.

40:43.024 --> 40:45.526
After all, we did make a bargain.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.486
Didn't we, Cinderella?

40:49.322 --> 40:52.825
And I never go back on my word.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.578
How very clever.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.413
These beads,

40:58.498 --> 41:01.458
they give it just the right touch.

41:01.543 --> 41:04.086
Don't you think so, Drizella?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.505
No, I don't. I think she's...

41:06.589 --> 41:09.174
Why, you little thief!

41:09.926 --> 41:12.261
They're my beads. Give them here.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.762
Oh, no.

41:13.847 --> 41:15.973
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.851
- Mine!
- Oh, please.

41:18.935 --> 41:21.103
Please, no.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.688
Thief!

41:24.858 --> 41:26.859
Girls, girls.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.654
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.824
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.

41:38.538 --> 41:39.913
Good night.

42:19.495 --> 42:24.791
You will lose your heartache

42:24.876 --> 42:28.879
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep

42:28.963 --> 42:31.673
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

42:31.758 --> 42:36.094
Have faith in your dreams
and someday

42:36.179 --> 42:38.388
It's just no use.

42:38.473 --> 42:40.974
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

42:41.059 --> 42:42.809
No use at all.

42:43.853 --> 42:48.273
No matter how your heart is grieving

42:48.358 --> 42:50.943
If you keep on believing

42:51.027 --> 42:54.029
I can't believe. Not any more.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.156
The dream that you wish

42:56.241 --> 42:58.367
Will come true

42:58.451 --> 43:00.869
There's nothing left to believe in.

43:00.954 --> 43:02.204
Nothing.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.790
Nothing, my dear?

43:04.874 --> 43:08.293
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.

43:08.378 --> 43:10.212
Nonsense, child!

43:10.296 --> 43:13.632
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.342
And here I am.

43:15.635 --> 43:19.096
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

43:19.180 --> 43:21.306
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

43:21.391 --> 43:22.432
The ball?

43:22.517 --> 43:24.935
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.395
But we have to hurry,

43:26.479 --> 43:28.730
because even miracles take a little time.

43:28.815 --> 43:32.317
- Miracles?
- Watch.

43:32.402 --> 43:35.362
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand? I was sure...

43:35.446 --> 43:36.613
Magic wand?

43:36.698 --> 43:38.282
That's strange.

43:38.366 --> 43:41.076
- I always...
- Then you must be...

43:41.160 --> 43:44.288
Your fairy godmother? Of course.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.748
Where is that wand? I...

43:47.417 --> 43:49.418
Oh! I forgot.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.003
I put it away.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.215
Look at what she did.

43:55.300 --> 43:56.758
How'd she do it?

43:56.843 --> 43:59.886
Now, let's see.

43:59.971 --> 44:03.140
I'd say the first thing you need is

44:03.224 --> 44:05.559
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?

44:05.643 --> 44:09.187
Now the magic words.

44:14.193 --> 44:19.114
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:19.198 --> 44:21.283
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

44:21.367 --> 44:23.410
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:23.494 --> 44:27.956
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:28.041 --> 44:30.292
It'll do magic
Believe it or not

44:30.376 --> 44:32.461
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:32.545 --> 44:36.965
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo

44:37.050 --> 44:39.468
But the thing-a-ma-bob
that does the job

44:39.552 --> 44:42.179
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:42.263 --> 44:46.808
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:46.893 --> 44:48.977
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

44:49.062 --> 44:52.939
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

44:54.400 --> 44:55.692
Oh, looky.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.569
Isn't it wonderful?

44:58.404 --> 45:00.697
Oh, it's beautiful.

45:00.782 --> 45:03.200
Yes, isn't it?

45:03.284 --> 45:05.702
With an elegant coach like that,
of course,

45:05.787 --> 45:08.580
we'll simply have to have

45:08.915 --> 45:11.458
- mice!
- Mice?

45:11.542 --> 45:14.002
Oh, this really is nice.

45:14.087 --> 45:17.172
Why, we'll have a coach
and four when we're through.

45:17.256 --> 45:20.717
Just a wave of my stick
and to finish the trick,

45:20.802 --> 45:23.720
bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.847
Gracious, what did I do?

45:25.932 --> 45:29.726
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.

45:29.811 --> 45:31.812
There you are.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.315
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

45:45.618 --> 45:47.828
Oh, poor Lucifer.

45:47.912 --> 45:50.205
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...

45:50.289 --> 45:53.208
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.836
You can't go to the ball without

45:55.920 --> 45:57.379
a horse.

45:57.463 --> 45:58.964
Another one?

45:59.465 --> 46:03.135
But tonight, for a change,
you will handle the reins,

46:03.219 --> 46:05.637
and sit in the driver's seat, too.

46:06.097 --> 46:09.683
For instead of a horse,
you're the coachman, of course.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.685
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

46:15.773 --> 46:19.234
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!

46:19.318 --> 46:22.446
The finishing touch. And, that's you.

46:22.530 --> 46:26.324
Yes, Bruno, that's right,
you'll be footman tonight.

46:26.659 --> 46:28.994
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.998
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.792
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.

46:35.877 --> 46:39.546
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...

46:39.630 --> 46:41.298
But, don't you think my dress...

46:41.382 --> 46:44.217
Yes, it's lovely, dear.

46:44.302 --> 46:48.221
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!

46:49.849 --> 46:52.100
Now, let's see, dear.

46:52.185 --> 46:56.438
Your size and the shade of your eyes.

46:56.522 --> 46:59.649
Something simple, but daring, too.

46:59.734 --> 47:03.487
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.198
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.

47:06.282 --> 47:08.617
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

47:10.870 --> 47:14.080
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.

47:14.165 --> 47:17.375
Did you ever see
such a beautiful dress?

47:17.460 --> 47:20.212
And, look, glass slippers.

47:21.964 --> 47:24.132
Why, it's like a dream.

47:24.217 --> 47:27.135
A wonderful dream come true.

47:27.220 --> 47:28.803
Yes, my child.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.555
But, like all dreams,

47:30.640 --> 47:33.433
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

47:33.518 --> 47:35.560
You'll have only till midnight, and then...

47:35.645 --> 47:37.229
Midnight? Thank you.

47:37.313 --> 47:40.690
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear,

47:40.775 --> 47:43.985
on the stroke of 12:00
the spell will be broken,

47:44.070 --> 47:46.655
and everything will be as it was before.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.990
Oh, I understand, but

47:49.075 --> 47:51.743
it's more than I ever hoped for.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.537
Bless you, my child.

47:53.621 --> 47:56.122
I... Goodness me!

47:56.207 --> 47:59.459
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.878
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.

48:01.963 --> 48:04.130
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.508
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi

48:06.592 --> 48:08.260
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

48:36.163 --> 48:39.916
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.

48:44.297 --> 48:47.090
Mademoiselle Augustina DuBois.

48:47.174 --> 48:50.594
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.

49:01.147 --> 49:03.982
The boy isn't cooperating.

49:04.817 --> 49:08.945
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.

49:09.030 --> 49:13.450
Daughter of Colonel
and Madame de la Tour.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.500
I can't understand it.

49:22.585 --> 49:25.629
There must be at least one
who'd make a suitable mother.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.589
Sire.

49:27.673 --> 49:30.133
A suitable wife.

49:49.236 --> 49:54.783
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.

49:54.867 --> 49:57.535
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.

50:03.834 --> 50:07.337
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...

50:07.421 --> 50:10.965
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you,

50:11.050 --> 50:14.886
but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.

50:15.346 --> 50:19.933
No doubt you saw
the whole pretty picture in detail.

50:20.559 --> 50:24.354
The young Prince
bowing to the assembly.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.233
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.

50:28.317 --> 50:31.861
For, lo, there she stands.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.239
The girl of his dreams.

50:35.991 --> 50:37.909
Who she is or whence she came,

50:38.494 --> 50:40.829
he knows not, nor does he care,

50:40.913 --> 50:43.707
for his heart tells him that here,

50:43.791 --> 50:48.837
here is the maid
predestined to be his bride.

50:50.673 --> 50:53.341
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.

50:53.426 --> 50:55.552
But in real life, oh, no.

50:55.636 --> 50:58.930
No! It was foredoomed to failure.

50:59.265 --> 51:01.808
Failure, eh?

51:01.892 --> 51:05.061
Take a look at that,
you pompous windbag.

51:06.355 --> 51:07.689
Who is she?

51:07.773 --> 51:09.858
- You know her?
- No, Sire.

51:09.942 --> 51:12.026
I've never seen her before.

51:12.111 --> 51:14.404
That's one thing in her favour.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.448
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

51:20.244 --> 51:23.329
Lights. The lights.

51:42.308 --> 51:44.726
Failure, eh?

51:48.606 --> 51:52.066
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.

51:52.151 --> 51:54.861
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...

51:54.945 --> 51:57.697
You will stay right here.

51:57.782 --> 52:01.409
See they're not disturbed,
and when the boy proposes,

52:01.494 --> 52:04.579
notify me immediately.

52:04.663 --> 52:06.122
Notify me immediately.

52:06.207 --> 52:07.916
And remember,

52:08.000 --> 52:10.502
if anything goes wrong...

52:26.811 --> 52:29.395
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

52:29.480 --> 52:31.940
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.

52:32.024 --> 52:34.108
I know I've never seen her.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.527
Nor I.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.613
But she certainly is... Wait.

52:39.365 --> 52:41.950
There is something familiar about her.

52:52.378 --> 52:53.461
Ahem.

53:02.972 --> 53:05.572
So this is love

53:12.064 --> 53:15.984
So this is what makes life

53:16.068 --> 53:19.195
Divine

53:19.280 --> 53:22.782
I'm all aglow

53:22.867 --> 53:27.203
- And now I know
- And now I know

53:27.288 --> 53:31.791
The key to all Heaven

53:31.876 --> 53:35.336
Is mine

53:35.421 --> 53:39.424
My heart has wings

53:39.508 --> 53:43.511
And I can fly

53:43.596 --> 53:47.432
I'll touch every star

53:47.516 --> 53:50.768
In the sky

53:52.021 --> 53:56.900
So this is the miracle

53:56.984 --> 54:02.780
That I've been dreaming of

54:11.832 --> 54:14.250
So this

54:14.335 --> 54:16.961
Is

54:17.046 --> 54:20.465
Love

54:23.886 --> 54:25.470
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

54:25.554 --> 54:27.305
What's the matter?

54:27.389 --> 54:28.640
It's midnight.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.725
Yes, so it is. But why...

54:30.809 --> 54:33.102
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.

54:33.187 --> 54:35.897
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.

54:35.981 --> 54:37.607
- Please, I must.
- But why?

54:37.691 --> 54:39.943
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,

54:40.027 --> 54:41.486
I haven't met the Prince.

54:41.570 --> 54:42.904
The Prince?

54:42.988 --> 54:44.113
But didn't you know...

54:45.407 --> 54:47.575
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.

54:47.660 --> 54:49.953
Come back. Please come back.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.872
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

54:52.957 --> 54:54.499
Wait! Please wait.

54:55.626 --> 54:56.960
Goodbye.

54:57.544 --> 54:59.796
Oh, I say. Young lady.

54:59.880 --> 55:03.091
- Wait!
- The Prince!

55:12.768 --> 55:13.851
Just a moment.

55:14.895 --> 55:17.605
Guard! Guard!

55:18.691 --> 55:22.193
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

55:25.197 --> 55:27.115
Follow that coach!

55:27.199 --> 55:29.575
Open those gates!

56:06.280 --> 56:07.739
I'm sorry.

56:08.490 --> 56:11.743
I guess I forgot about everything.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.495
Even the time, but...

56:15.956 --> 56:18.708
But it was so wonderful.

56:19.752 --> 56:21.669
And he was so handsome,

56:21.754 --> 56:24.172
and when we danced...

56:24.256 --> 56:27.884
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince
himself couldn't have been more...

56:27.968 --> 56:29.177
More...

56:30.345 --> 56:33.014
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.

56:33.098 --> 56:35.099
Look, look! The slippers!

56:35.225 --> 56:36.309
Yeah, your slipper.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.603
Your slipper, Cinderelly.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.067
Thank you.

56:44.777 --> 56:47.695
Thank you so much, for everything.

56:57.539 --> 57:01.918
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.

57:02.002 --> 57:03.961
I regret to inform you, Sire,

57:04.046 --> 57:06.214
that the young lady has disappeared,

57:06.298 --> 57:09.092
leaving behind only this glass slipper.

57:09.176 --> 57:10.968
Yes. I'll do it.

57:13.138 --> 57:16.307
No. I just can't.

57:44.962 --> 57:46.629
Well, come in.

57:47.172 --> 57:48.756
Come in!

57:48.841 --> 57:52.051
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?

57:52.136 --> 57:53.594
- Tell me about it.
- Well...

57:53.679 --> 57:56.097
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...

57:56.181 --> 57:58.808
No matter. We've more
important things to discuss.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.560
Arrangements for the wedding,

58:00.644 --> 58:03.271
invitations, a national holiday.

58:03.981 --> 58:06.232
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...

58:06.316 --> 58:08.985
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.

58:09.528 --> 58:10.570
But...

58:10.654 --> 58:13.447
Better practise passing these out, eh?

58:13.532 --> 58:16.784
But, if you'd only listen.

58:16.869 --> 58:18.619
And for you, my friend.

58:18.704 --> 58:22.456
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.

58:22.541 --> 58:25.042
I hereby dub you Sir...

58:26.336 --> 58:28.921
By the way, what title would you like?

58:29.423 --> 58:32.466
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?

58:32.551 --> 58:34.719
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...

58:35.637 --> 58:38.389
She what? Why, you...

58:38.515 --> 58:40.641
You... You traitor!

58:40.726 --> 58:43.644
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.

58:43.729 --> 58:45.605
Treason!

58:48.442 --> 58:49.984
No, Sire. No!

58:50.068 --> 58:52.445
Sabotage!

58:53.405 --> 58:55.323
You were in league with the Prince.

58:55.407 --> 58:57.450
I tried to stop her,

58:57.534 --> 58:59.410
but she vanished into thin air.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.245
A likely story.

59:01.330 --> 59:04.665
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.

59:04.750 --> 59:07.251
The whole thing was a plot!

59:08.086 --> 59:10.838
But, Sire, he loves her.

59:10.923 --> 59:12.840
He won't rest till he finds her.

59:12.925 --> 59:14.842
He's determined to marry her.

59:16.220 --> 59:19.180
What? What did you say?

59:19.556 --> 59:22.141
The Prince, Sire,
swears he'll marry none

59:22.226 --> 59:24.352
but the girl who fits this slipper.

59:24.436 --> 59:26.229
He said that, did he?

59:27.272 --> 59:29.857
We've got him!

59:34.947 --> 59:38.366
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit one of any number of girls.

59:38.450 --> 59:41.327
That's his problem. He's given his word.

59:41.411 --> 59:44.538
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.624
I'll have nothing to do with it.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.418
You'll try this
on every maid in my kingdom.

59:49.503 --> 59:50.753
And if the shoe fits,

59:52.339 --> 59:54.215
bring her in.

59:54.299 --> 59:57.093
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:00:10.983 --> 01:00:13.192
Cinderella? Cinderella?

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.362
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.780
Here I am.

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:19.740
My daughters, where are they?

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:21.325
I think they're still in bed.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:26.831
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:28.124
And hurry!

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:31.335
I wonder what's the matter.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.129
What's the matter with her?

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:35.423
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.

01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:45.433
Drizella. Drizella!

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.643
What?

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:49.687
Get up. Quick. This instant.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:51.647
We haven't a moment to lose.

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:55.985
Anastasia.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:00:59.989
Get up, Anastasia.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.326
What for? Why?

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:06.245
Everyone's talking about it,
the whole kingdom.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.831
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:11.959
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.128
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:16.756
The one who lost
her slipper at the ball last night.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.799
They say he's madly in love with her.

01:01:18.884 --> 01:01:22.511
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!

01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.847
The Prince!

01:01:26.475 --> 01:01:28.768
You clumsy little fool.

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:32.146
Clean that up,
then help my daughters dress.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:33.481
What for?

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.649
If he's in love with that girl,

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.485
why should we even bother?

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:40.363
Now, you two, listen to me.

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:43.491
There is still a chance
that one of you can get it.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:46.911
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.662
Just this:

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:52.333
No one, not even the Prince,
knows who that girl is.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.169
We know! We know! Cinderelly!

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:57.797
The glass slipper is their only clue.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.383
The Duke has been ordered to try it on

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:01.842
every girl in the kingdom.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:05.054
And if one can be found
whom the slipper fits,

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.515
then, by the King's command,

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:10.101
that girl shall be the Prince's bride.

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:13.020
- His bride.
- His bride!

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:15.439
Cinderella, get my things together.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:17.441
Never mind her. Get mine right away.

01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.368
What's the matter with her?

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:30.913
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.375
Dressed. Oh, yes.

01:02:34.459 --> 01:02:36.127
Oh, we must get dressed.

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:38.504
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.256
Mother, did you see what she did?

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.800
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!

01:02:44.553 --> 01:02:47.555
So this is love

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.445
What's she gonna do?

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.155
I don't know. Gotta watch.

01:03:04.239 --> 01:03:05.489
Come on.

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.016
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.186
So this is the miracle

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.354
That I've been dreaming of

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:43.360
What?

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.447
Oh, no!

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.491
No, please!

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:51.160
Oh, you can't, you just can't.

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:54.121
Let me out! You must let me out!

01:03:54.206 --> 01:03:57.208
You can't keep me in here!

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:00.127
Oh, please.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:03.339
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.840
I'm gonna...

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:07.134
Please. Please.

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.846
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.985
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.113
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.365
We gotta get that key quick.

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:31.367
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:36.580
Oh, Mother, Mother,
he's here, he's here.

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:38.707
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.919
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:45.422
Now, remember,
this is your last chance. Don't fail me.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:54.014
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.892
You honour our humble home.

01:04:56.977 --> 01:04:58.018
Quite so.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.854
May I present my daughters,

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.732
Drizella, Anastasia.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.192
Your Grace.

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:08.988
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:12.449
His Grace will read
the royal proclamation.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.997
"All loyal subjects
of His Imperial Majesty"

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:21.375
"are hereby notified by royal
proclamation in regard to a certain"

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:24.920
"glass slipper."

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.089
"It is decreed..."

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:30.092
Why, that's my slipper!

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.345
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:36.724
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:39.727
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.312
Your manners.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:44.898
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.525
Please continue.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:47.943
Yes, quite so.

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:51.697
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed"

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.992
"that a quest be instituted throughout..."

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:58.829
"The sole and express
purpose of such quest to be as follows:"

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.584
"That every maid throughout the
kingdom without exception,"

01:06:03.668 --> 01:06:06.587
"shall try on her foot
this slipper of glass,"

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:10.382
"and should one be found upon whose
foot this slipper shall properly fit,"

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:16.096
"such maiden shall be
acclaimed the object of this search"

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:19.433
"and shall be looked upon
as the true love of His Royal Highness,"

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:23.187
"our beloved son and heir,
the noble Prince."

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.649
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee"

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.109
"beg, request, or if need be, implore"

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:32.655
"said maiden that he be granted her
hand in marriage."

01:06:32.739 --> 01:06:35.157
"Whereupon,
should the aforementioned maiden"

01:06:35.241 --> 01:06:38.702
"look with favour,
shall the couple pledge their troth..."

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:45.417
"And in due course, upon the inevitable
demise of His Majesty the King,"

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:47.795
"succeed to the throne
to rule over the land"

01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:50.756
"as King and Queen of our kingdom."

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.049
"So be it."

01:06:55.053 --> 01:06:57.137
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:59.640
May we offer you some tea?

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:02.309
What? Tea?

01:07:02.394 --> 01:07:04.687
Thank you, madam, no.

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.356
We must proceed with the fitting.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.817
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.865
There. I knew it was my slipper.

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:18.992
Exactly my size.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.911
I always wear the same size.

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:22.871
As soon as I saw it, I said...

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:24.832
Oh, well...

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:27.668
It may be a trifle snug today.

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:30.337
You know how it is, dancing all night.

01:07:30.422 --> 01:07:32.297
I can't understand why.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.425
It's always fit perfectly before.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:36.719
I don't think you're half trying.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.847
Mother, can you...

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:43.225
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:46.854
Young man, are you sure
you're trying it on the right foot?

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:52.359
Oh, it's the right foot, but...

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:54.194
These glass shoes
aren't always reliable.

01:07:54.279 --> 01:07:56.196
Come on, hurry.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.157
Up the stairs, up the stairs!

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:01.994
Lucify, Lucify.

01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:07.791
Up, up, up with it.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:18.969
Here.

01:08:34.986 --> 01:08:36.904
Why can't you hold still a minute?

01:08:36.988 --> 01:08:40.032
My word. Enough of this!

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.745
The next young lady, please.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:46.455
Did you hear that, Gus?

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:48.582
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.

01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:56.340
Come on, come on, hurry.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.850
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:09.770
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:20.823
Us is coming, Cinderelly.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.492
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.495
How did you ever manage to...

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.162
Lucifer!

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.541
Let him go, Lucifer.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.167
Please, let him go.

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:35.754
- Let him go.
- Let him go!

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:38.298
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:40.133
Lucify, you...

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:21.592
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.803
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:48.285
Of all the stupid little idiots.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.954
I'll do it myself.

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:52.748
Get away from me.

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:55.876
I'll make it fit.

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:58.295
- There.
- It fits.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:10:59.630
It fits?

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.842
No!

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:12.601
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.519
It shan't happen again.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.063
Precisely, madam.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:45.342
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:47.844
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.472
Let go, let go.

01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:58.188
You are the only ladies
in the household I hope... I presume.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:00.983
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:03.652
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:06.780
Your Grace, please, wait.

01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:08.991
May I try it on?

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:11.910
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.870
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.

01:12:13.955 --> 01:12:15.998
She's out of her mind.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:18.000
Just an imaginative child.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:21.086
Madam,
my orders were "every maiden."

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:24.172
Come, my child.

01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:41.106
Oh, no.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.650
No, no, no. Oh, no!

01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:45.777
Oh, this is terrible.

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:48.071
The King, what will he say?

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.323
What will he do?

01:12:50.408 --> 01:12:51.950
Perhaps, if it would help...

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:55.454
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.539
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:38.622
Have faith in dreams

01:13:38.706 --> 01:13:41.416
And someday

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:47.047
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:51.927
No matter how your heart is grieving

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:56.181
If you keep on believing

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:59.518
The dream that you wish

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.605
Will come true

01:14:04.305 --> 01:14:10.871
