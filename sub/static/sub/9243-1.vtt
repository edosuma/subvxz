05:05.555 --> 05:07.264
What is it?

05:12.020 --> 05:15.564
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.692
Just pass me.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.277
Pass me.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.744
- Is it a cop?
- I can't see.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.649
What the fuck
are these jokers playing at?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.916
Oh, they ain't playing.
You better believe.

05:45.470 --> 05:49.014
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.937
Okay. Hold on, you guys.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.950
There's a truck, too.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.136
Shit, it is a cop.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.140
You better stop.

06:33.142 --> 06:37.437
Okay, sit tight, you guys.
Don't say anything. Let me talk.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.399
All right. We'll be all right.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.317
Just relax.

07:18.855 --> 07:21.773
Y'all think you can drive
any speed you want around here?

07:21.983 --> 07:24.010
You had us scared to death, man.

07:24.110 --> 07:27.112
Don't call me "man," Jew-boy.

07:27.321 --> 07:28.613
No, sir. What should I call you?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.741
You don't call me nothing,
nigger-loving Jew-boy. You just listen.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.121
Yes, sir.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.876
Hell, you even starting to smell
like a nigger, Jew-boy.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.004
Take it easy. We'll be all right.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.881
Sure you will, nigger-lover.

07:46.090 --> 07:50.302
He's seen your face. That ain't good.
You don't want him seeing your face.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.581
Oh, it don't make no difference no more.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.088
Oh, shit! We into it now, boys!

08:02.398 --> 08:03.716
You only left me a nigger,

08:03.816 --> 08:05.259
but at least I shot me a nigger.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.613
Yes, indeed.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.932
Now listen, you communists
and niggers and Jews

08:37.099 --> 08:39.893
Tell all your buddies
To spread the news

08:40.102 --> 08:43.270
Your day of judgment
Will soon be nigh

08:43.481 --> 08:46.942
As the Lord in his wisdom
Looks down from on high

08:47.109 --> 08:50.070
Will his battle be lost
By mixing the races?

08:50.279 --> 08:54.199
We want beautiful babies
Not ones with brown faces

08:54.408 --> 08:57.118
Never, never
Never I say

08:57.286 --> 08:59.037
For the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to stay

08:59.247 --> 09:01.373
Never, never
Never I say

09:01.582 --> 09:04.501
'Cause the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to stay

09:04.710 --> 09:07.504
These Ku Kluxers are better
with lynchings than they are with lyrics.

09:08.381 --> 09:13.202
Just read the file, Mr. Anderson.
I can do without the cabaret.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.745
You don't like me much, do you, boss?

09:14.845 --> 09:16.263
Sure I like you.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.348
I just don't share your sense of humor.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.477
Sometimes that's all you got left.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.838
How long you been in the bureau?

09:23.938 --> 09:25.021
Three years.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.467
Right out of college, huh?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.901
No. From the Justice Department.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.321
Kennedy boy. Now I see.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.158
No, I don't think you do see.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.828
Let's get this thing straight.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.373
I haven't had a pimple in years.
I shave every morning.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.234
I even go to the bathroom by myself.

09:45.334 --> 09:48.003
So you can quit this "boss" stuff.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.756
They put me in charge
because I've been through this before.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.342
- Birmingham? Montgomery?
- Oxford.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.679
I was with Meredith at Ole Miss.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.810
Got hit in the head with a brick,
so they gave you a promotion, right?

10:01.110 --> 10:03.318
No. Shot in the shoulder.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.688
Well, at least you lived.
That's important.

10:06.897 --> 10:10.525
No, Meredith lived.
That's what's important.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.951
What's got four eyes and can't see?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.414
- What?
- Mississippi.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.945
Never, never
Never I say

10:29.045 --> 10:32.355
'Cause the Ku Klux Klan
Is here to...

11:05.247 --> 11:07.582
Big building for a small town.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.296
Howdy.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.455
Good morning.

11:48.082 --> 11:52.210
My name's Alan Ward. I'm with the FBI.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.381
Federal Bureau of Integration?

11:59.301 --> 12:01.469
In that get-up, you ain't exactly
undercover, are you, now?

12:01.887 --> 12:04.081
We're here to see Sheriff Stuckey.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.474
Sheriff's right busy now.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.396
You'll have to wait
or come back some other time.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.483
We'll wait.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.915
Listen to me,
you backwoods shit-ass, you.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.752
You got about two seconds
to get the sheriff out here,

12:33.961 --> 12:36.504
or I'm gonna kick
the goddamned door in, okay?

12:40.217 --> 12:43.371
Well, hell, looks like
we got some company.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.706
Some Hoover boys come down to visit.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.724
- How you doing?
- Good.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.543
I'm Sheriff Stuckey.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.769
Rupert Anderson.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.756
- Rupert? We been expecting you.
- Uh-huh.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.232
I assume you met my deputy, Mr. Pell?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.109
Sure did.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.237
You down here to help us solve
our nigger problems?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.016
No. It's just a missing-person case.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.909
Hmm. Well, come on.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.689
Say, you gonna want your boy in on this?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.998
Sheriff, I'm Special Agent Ward.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.542
I'm in charge of this case.

13:15.044 --> 13:18.338
We think it might be a little more serious
than missing persons.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.882
I don't think so, boy.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.385
In fact, you know what I think it is,
it's a publicity stunt

13:24.595 --> 13:27.680
cooked up by that
Martin Luther King fella.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.766
Come on.

13:41.987 --> 13:46.032
At around 3:00 p.m., Deputy Pell says
he arrested the three boys for speeding.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.828
He held them in jail until 10:00 p.m.,
and then released them.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.579
They drove off.

13:51.747 --> 13:54.233
He says he followed them
as far as the county line

13:54.333 --> 13:57.085
and never saw them again.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.129
Why didn't they make a phone call?

14:00.756 --> 14:02.074
Why should they?

14:02.174 --> 14:04.801
Mr. Anderson, these boys
were trained activists.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.996
They're taught to check in every hour,

14:07.096 --> 14:09.222
and if they're arrested, the moment
they're released from custody.

14:09.431 --> 14:13.476
The hotel's two minutes from the jail.
They could have phoned from the lobby.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.103
It just doesn't follow.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.672
Maybe they went for a beer.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.064
Not these boys.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.734
The civil rights office in Rossville started
making calls as soon as they didn't check in.

14:22.486 --> 14:26.656
The sheriff's office here said
they had no idea where the boys were.

14:27.575 --> 14:28.658
First lie.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.747
By who? The sheriff's office
or the civil rights office?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.041
Who would you believe?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.236
Mr. Ward, I don't know
if you knew it or not,

14:39.336 --> 14:41.504
but I was a sheriff in a little
Mississippi town just like this.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.073
Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. Anderson.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.034
Well, lying just don't come into it.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.827
We were right on the border,
10 miles from Memphis,

14:46.927 --> 14:48.996
and a million miles
from the rest of the world.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.098
Now, if a sheriff in a little town like this
says that's what happened,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.392
then that's what happened.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.935
Let's go eat.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.896
We're full up right now, honey.
Y'all wanna wait a while?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.246
Is the wait worth it?

15:15.456 --> 15:18.875
We're not full for nothing, sugar.
Y'all want to look at a menu while you wait?

15:19.084 --> 15:20.668
- Sure.
- Thank you.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.963
Well, what y'all gonna do,
wait or leave?

15:25.132 --> 15:28.009
We're gonna wait because
we want to be near you.

15:28.218 --> 15:30.511
There's some empty seats down there.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.055
Uh, Mr. Ward.

15:33.015 --> 15:36.017
That's the colored down there.
Don't even think about it.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.337
There's some people over here
getting ready to leave right now.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.688
Aren't you hungry, Mr. Anderson?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.867
Good afternoon. Looks good.

16:03.879 --> 16:06.547
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.925
I'm looking for some information.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.747
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.390
Just a few questions.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.439
I ain't got nothing to say to you, sir.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.819
Three civil rights boys came here

16:43.919 --> 16:47.046
to propose setting up a voter
registration clinic.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.633
Before the locals got a chance to say yes,
the Klan burned them down.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.011
Give a man a vote,
but don't let him use it.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.080
That's the way it works.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.056
What'd their office in Rossville
have to say?

16:57.266 --> 17:01.894
They confirmed that the boys came back
here to apologize to the congregation.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.548
Sorry you folks didn't get to vote.

17:04.647 --> 17:07.900
I suppose most of you never knew
you even had one.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.903
Now you got no place to go on Sunday.

17:12.948 --> 17:16.951
Apparently, after they came back here,
they talked to some locals down the road.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.520
I think that's where we should start.

17:18.619 --> 17:22.398
Well, you can talk to them,
but they won't talk to you.

17:22.499 --> 17:25.778
These people have to live here
long after we're packed up and gone.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.795
They'd rather bite
their tongue off than talk to us.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.381
Bureau procedure, Mr. Anderson.

17:38.265 --> 17:42.060
The church caught fire
and you ran home, is that correct?

17:42.686 --> 17:44.020
Yes, sir.

17:44.229 --> 17:46.966
Then the four white men stopped you?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.399
Yes, sir.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.152
These four white men
attacked your husband?

17:52.112 --> 17:53.863
Yes, sir.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.991
But you can't identify them?

17:58.827 --> 18:00.453
No, sir.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.857
Did you report this to the police?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.917
No, sir.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.988
But you told
the civil rights boys what happened?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.671
Yes, sir.

18:12.007 --> 18:16.135
Ma'am, did they tell you where they
were going after that?

18:19.348 --> 18:20.556
No, sir.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.584
Nothing?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.685
No, sir.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.940
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.025
You're welcome.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.331
Come on, boy.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.833
Open up.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.945
Your brother Hollis here?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.129
Yes, sir.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.714
Well, wake his ass up.
We want to see him.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.675
- Why?
- Just wake him up, boy.

18:55.884 --> 18:56.952
Why? What's the matter?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.386
There you are!

19:01.181 --> 19:02.765
Come here, boy!

19:03.225 --> 19:04.334
Hollis!

19:06.061 --> 19:08.396
Get your ass back here,
you fucking nigger!

19:08.605 --> 19:11.274
Hollis! Hollis!

19:17.823 --> 19:19.115
Shit!

19:26.623 --> 19:29.417
We better not catch you
talking to the FBI.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.669
You'll be dead, boy.

19:50.230 --> 19:52.356
You admire these kids, don't you?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.775
Don't you?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.529
I think they're being used.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.783
I think they're sent down here in their
Volkswagens and their sneakers,

20:02.951 --> 20:04.744
just to get their heads cracked open.

20:04.953 --> 20:08.331
Did it ever occur to you that maybe
they believed in what they were doing?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.609
Did it ever occur to them
they were gonna end up dead?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.001
Maybe.

20:13.128 --> 20:15.796
In Washington they sure as hell knew,
didn't they?

20:16.548 --> 20:18.174
Some things are worth dying for.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.305
Down here they see
things a little differently.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.726
People down here
feel some things are worth killing for.

20:32.856 --> 20:36.442
Where does it come from,
all this hatred?

20:39.404 --> 20:41.822
You know, when I was a little boy,

20:42.032 --> 20:45.284
an old Negro farmer lived
down the road, name of Monroe.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.662
And he was, uh...

20:48.830 --> 20:52.583
I guess he was luckier
than my daddy was.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.673
He bought himself a mule.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.177
That was a big deal around that town.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.138
My daddy hated that mule.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.458
His friends always kidded him about

21:08.558 --> 21:11.686
Monroe plowing with his new mule.

21:11.853 --> 21:16.941
And Monroe was gonna rent another
field now that he had a mule.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.696
One morning that mule
just showed up dead.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.158
They poisoned the water.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.413
After that, the mule
wasn't mentioned to my daddy.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.707
Just never came up.

21:35.919 --> 21:40.548
Once, driving along, we passed
Monroe's place and it was empty.

21:40.757 --> 21:44.051
He packed and left.
Gone up north or something.

21:46.513 --> 21:50.391
I looked over at my daddy's face

21:51.476 --> 21:54.103
and I knew he'd done it.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.566
He saw that I knew. He was ashamed.

21:59.401 --> 22:02.028
I guess he was ashamed.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.906
He looked at me and he said,

22:06.742 --> 22:09.577
"If you ain't better than a nigger,
who are you better than?"

22:13.290 --> 22:14.816
You think that's an excuse?

22:14.916 --> 22:18.669
No. It's just a story about my daddy.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.911
Where's that leave you?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.763
With an old man so full of hate

22:28.972 --> 22:33.476
that he didn't know being poor
was what was killing him.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.944
Get the light! Get the light!

22:45.947 --> 22:47.448
You all right?

22:58.251 --> 23:00.294
I guess they know we're here.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.250
Now you know what you're getting into.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.002
I'll call Washington.
I need more agents.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.006
Make any difference if I say
it's the wrong thing to do?

23:46.216 --> 23:47.675
No.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.350
The whole place for $75 a month.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.645
It's private. It's central.
It's perfect.

24:41.855 --> 24:45.024
There's room for 100 more agents.
200, maybe.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.234
More on the balcony.

24:47.402 --> 24:50.138
We're trying to find
the boys, Mr. Anderson.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.281
I'll take all the help I can get.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.534
When's the show start?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.451
Who's the big shot?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.051
That's the Klan.

25:55.178 --> 25:58.681
No pointy hats,
but plenty of pointy heads.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.226
Let me run a check on the plates.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.009
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.468
Anderson.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.429
Say hello to our mayor, Mr. Tilman.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.457
How do you do, Anderson?

26:40.557 --> 26:42.349
Mr. Mayor, Mr. Barber.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.978
This looks like the place to be.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.272
Even for me.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.943
Nothing like a barber shop
for jawing your socks off.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.764
Where you from, Anderson?

26:55.864 --> 26:57.406
Thornton, Mississippi, sir.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.325
Just a spit from Tennessee.

26:59.534 --> 27:03.037
Then you must know
how we all feel down here.

27:03.204 --> 27:06.874
We don't take to outsiders
telling us how to live.

27:07.083 --> 27:11.170
Our nigras were happy,
till those beatnik college kids

27:11.379 --> 27:15.716
came here stirring things up.
Before that, nobody complained.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.677
Nobody dared.

27:20.388 --> 27:23.349
We got a peaceful community, Anderson.

27:23.558 --> 27:28.395
They're like other folks, I reckon.
You push them too far...

27:28.605 --> 27:33.317
The way I figure it, it's like
three sticks of old dynamite.

27:33.526 --> 27:38.530
You shake it up, and we'll be
scraping bodies off the street.

27:39.282 --> 27:43.619
I'm here to investigate the missing
three kids, ask questions.

27:43.828 --> 27:48.957
If this all boiled down to gravy,
there's not enough for a chicken-fried steak.

27:49.167 --> 27:53.629
Them kids you're looking for?
I'll bet you a shiny new dime

27:53.838 --> 27:56.491
they're sitting in Chicago

27:56.591 --> 27:59.160
drinking a cold beer
and having a big laugh

27:59.260 --> 28:01.178
about all the commotion.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.888
Sure hope so.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.724
You tell your bosses

28:05.934 --> 28:09.269
people got the wrong idea
about the South.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.605
You know what I'm talking about.

28:11.815 --> 28:15.317
Everybody running around
ragged, backwards, illiterate,

28:15.527 --> 28:19.279
eating sow-belly and corn pone
three times a day.

28:19.447 --> 28:23.450
Simple fact is, Anderson,
we got two cultures down here.

28:23.618 --> 28:27.204
White culture, and the colored culture.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.566
That's the way it always has been.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.792
That's the way it always will be.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.070
Rest of America don't see that.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.463
America don't mean jack shit.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.882
You in Mississippi now.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.228
Oh, that's for sure.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.707
What's the score?

28:45.807 --> 28:47.641
St. Louis on top, five to nothing.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.044
What inning is it?

28:49.144 --> 28:50.394
Bottom of the seventh.

28:50.603 --> 28:52.339
You like baseball, Anderson?

28:52.439 --> 28:54.106
Yeah, I do. You know,

28:55.775 --> 29:00.821
it's the only time a black man
can wave a stick at a white man

29:01.448 --> 29:03.365
and not start a riot.

29:19.507 --> 29:20.716
Sir?

29:21.551 --> 29:25.012
We checked on the plate, sir.
Clayton Townley.

29:25.221 --> 29:29.266
Grand Wizard of the White
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.227
That's him.
And we have a lead on the car.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.605
A Choctaw thinks he knows where it is.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.049
I'm waiting for a call.

29:36.149 --> 29:37.357
Good.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.860
You have your appointment
for next Tuesday, right?

29:55.960 --> 29:58.420
See you then. Bye-bye.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.737
You gonna go to...

30:25.031 --> 30:26.824
Afternoon, ladies.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.409
Can I help you?

30:29.619 --> 30:34.331
Well, yes, you can.
I tell you, I hate the way I look.

30:34.541 --> 30:39.711
What do you think? A permanent wave,
maybe? Or a bleach job?

30:39.921 --> 30:43.048
That looks good.
You have that done here?

30:43.258 --> 30:44.492
Jackson.

30:44.592 --> 30:45.801
A wig's your only hope.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.538
You won't be able to do much
with that cue ball.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.973
Thank you.

30:51.182 --> 30:55.227
If you wanna ask questions,
here's where you'll hear it all.

30:55.436 --> 30:58.230
Well, matter of fact, I do.

30:58.439 --> 31:01.650
Who's that gentleman that just drove in?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.636
I know that isn't President Johnson.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.196
Clayton Townley.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.266
Are you one of them FBI gentlemen?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.158
Yes, ma'am, I am.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.521
I think it's a shame
those two kids are dead,

31:13.621 --> 31:15.581
but I hope you find them.

31:15.790 --> 31:19.835
Actually, it's three kids missing.
A colored kid also.

31:20.044 --> 31:24.798
You honestly think you'd be here
if it weren't for the white boys?

31:24.966 --> 31:26.758
- Maybe not, Miss...
- Mrs.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.262
Pell. Her old man's
Ray Stuckey's deputy.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.460
But I'm single.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.980
Look out! Here they come!

31:49.991 --> 31:51.116
Hollis?

31:54.996 --> 31:57.039
Get back. Move out of the way.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.545
It's a local problem.

32:03.755 --> 32:07.007
We'll handle it!
We don't need your damn help!

32:09.427 --> 32:14.681
It ain't right having blood on Main Street.
How'd that look on TV?

32:14.849 --> 32:16.266
- Okay, easy.
- Get up.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.253
I got him.

32:18.353 --> 32:20.103
Get out of the way, now.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.008
He's from the diner.

32:24.108 --> 32:27.861
Think before you talk
to colored kids with an audience.

32:28.029 --> 32:31.073
They're sending a message from Tupelo.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.743
I know it, yes.
Clayton Townley, chief pointy head.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.496
That's right. How did you know?

32:37.705 --> 32:39.816
Bureau procedure. Try it sometime.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.541
We did!

32:41.751 --> 32:44.586
We found the car the kids were driving.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.836
Good morning.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.346
Good morning.

34:58.096 --> 35:02.057
Two beer cans, a Coca Cola bottle,
green plastic bottle,

35:02.266 --> 35:05.560
badly burned wristwatch
stopped at 12:45, set of keys.

35:05.686 --> 35:07.213
No bodies.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.772
I want the entire area searched.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.091
Every inch.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.358
Yes, sir.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.719
It's a big swamp.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.694
Every inch, Mr. Bird.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.951
I guess they never left Mississippi.

35:22.411 --> 35:25.539
Yeah, they're dead. They're dead.

35:25.873 --> 35:27.275
Mr. Bird?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.959
Yes, sir?

35:29.460 --> 35:31.670
There's a telephone at the truck stop.

35:31.879 --> 35:36.883
Get to it, get on it and get me
100 more men here by morning.

35:37.051 --> 35:38.927
- 100?
- 100.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.705
Bureau people?

35:40.805 --> 35:42.347
It could be the goddamn army!

35:42.557 --> 35:44.500
I want this entire swamp searched.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.809
Yes, sir.

35:48.896 --> 35:52.399
Don't do it, Mr. Ward.
You'll just start a war.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.153
It was a war long before we got here.

36:46.287 --> 36:47.271
You too!

36:47.371 --> 36:48.371
Wake up! Come on!

36:53.794 --> 36:57.380
Get the fuck out of here, nigger! Go on!

37:36.837 --> 37:38.171
Sir?

37:39.674 --> 37:44.427
The sheriff's alibi is solid.
He was playing poker with relatives.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.746
The whole time?

37:45.846 --> 37:49.683
No, for three hours. He lost $11.38.

37:50.309 --> 37:51.919
Another thing, sir.

37:52.019 --> 37:54.896
We're having trouble with
the motel manager.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.215
What trouble?

37:56.315 --> 37:57.357
He wants us out.

37:57.566 --> 37:59.427
He says we're bad for business.

37:59.527 --> 38:01.319
Buy it.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.196
Sorry, sir?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.156
Buy it!

38:05.408 --> 38:07.117
The motel.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.853
How high can I go?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.745
Whatever it takes.

38:33.894 --> 38:35.963
Today in Jessup County,

38:36.063 --> 38:38.815
amidst the violence
erupting here this week,

38:39.025 --> 38:41.969
the nation's fixed on the search

38:42.069 --> 38:44.070
for the missing civil rights workers.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.806
I think it's a hoax.

38:45.906 --> 38:49.409
But if they are in that swamp,
then they asked for it.

38:49.618 --> 38:53.246
Naval reserves are in
to join scores of FBI agents

38:53.456 --> 38:55.457
in their search for the men.

38:55.666 --> 39:00.211
They planned the whole thing.
They're in New York laughing at us.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.489
You think it's a hoax?

39:01.589 --> 39:05.425
Yeah. They ain't gonna find nothing.

39:05.593 --> 39:10.096
Civil rights leaders are optimistic
as to the men's whereabouts,

39:10.264 --> 39:14.601
but privately, there is concern
they will ever be found alive.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.354
They looked for trouble and found it.

39:17.563 --> 39:21.941
This is Marek Barlbobi, Network News.
Jessup County, Mississippi.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.486
Sheriff Stuckey?

39:24.945 --> 39:28.615
They ought to be looking up in Canada
for them boys

39:28.783 --> 39:31.326
instead of our swamps here.

39:31.535 --> 39:37.123
Also, I think it's a publicity stunt
dreamed up by these NAACP people.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.526
NAACP?

39:38.626 --> 39:39.918
Yeah, NAACP.

39:40.252 --> 39:45.173
It stands for niggers, alligators, apes,
coons and possums.

39:45.383 --> 39:48.218
Tell you what you got.
You got your NAACP,

39:48.327 --> 39:51.846
you got your SNCC, your COFO...

39:52.056 --> 39:54.015
You know what that mess is?

39:54.225 --> 39:57.560
B-U-L-L-S-H-l-T. You got it?

39:57.770 --> 40:00.522
Sheriff, will this be a federal case?

40:02.274 --> 40:04.927
There'll be a time
when we don't gotta say,

40:05.027 --> 40:07.529
"Good morning, sir, Mr. Sheriff."

40:08.114 --> 40:12.325
There'll be a time when we won't
have to say, "Mr. Stuckey."

40:12.493 --> 40:16.913
There'll be a time when we just say
"Stuckey" or "Sheriff."

40:17.123 --> 40:21.418
There'll be a time when the sheriff
won't even be a white man.

40:33.013 --> 40:34.347
Hello.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.854
Could I ask you a few questions?

40:41.063 --> 40:44.899
I don't suppose you know
what kind of flower these are?

40:45.693 --> 40:48.903
I been seeing them all over the place.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.407
I never saw such a darn pretty plant.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.311
They're trumpet pitchers.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.203
Trumpet pitchers.

40:57.705 --> 41:00.373
They're beautiful. They really are.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.960
They don't smell so good,
but they're pretty.

41:08.257 --> 41:10.409
It's nice talking to you.

41:10.509 --> 41:12.552
Sorry about interrupting your meeting,

41:12.761 --> 41:15.122
but nobody will talk to us.

41:15.222 --> 41:17.515
They "zip up," like my mama used to say.

41:17.808 --> 41:22.103
People don't want to talk
for fear it'll get back to the law.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.090
We are the law.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.523
Not around here.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.694
We were sent to find out
what happened to those three boys.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.807
They were here to help you.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.908
It ain't us you should talk to.

41:35.576 --> 41:37.520
Who should we be talking to?

41:37.620 --> 41:39.162
Come on, Aaron.

41:41.081 --> 41:43.500
Start with the sheriff's office.

41:45.711 --> 41:47.154
Why ain't you afraid?

41:47.254 --> 41:48.614
How come you ain't?

41:48.714 --> 41:49.923
Aaron.

41:51.675 --> 41:53.635
Aaron? Come on, son.

42:07.233 --> 42:10.610
Here's the pitch.
Swing and a line-drive base hit.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.612
Another runner's home.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.285
On to the next pitch
by the ruffled Bob Gibson.

42:19.453 --> 42:24.541
Ron Hunt singled to center.
Hickman scored the Mets' second run.

42:24.750 --> 42:27.961
Hunt holds on at first.
Mets now lead 2 to 1.

42:28.128 --> 42:32.090
The next one up will be Joe Christopher
who struck out and popped out to Boyer.

42:33.842 --> 42:37.804
He's 0 for 2, and hitting a mere.252...

42:39.723 --> 42:43.836
Good evening, Mrs. Pell.
I'm Agent Ward. He's Agent Anderson.

42:43.936 --> 42:47.814
We're with the FBI.
Is your husband home?

42:48.816 --> 42:51.343
We'd like to have a word with him.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.903
Y'all come in, then.

43:00.286 --> 43:04.330
The FBI gentlemen
want to ask you some more questions.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.166
Want me to put your dinner in the oven?

43:09.837 --> 43:11.337
Leave us alone?

43:12.381 --> 43:14.465
Mind if I take a seat?

43:18.345 --> 43:21.014
Why you gotta bother me at home?

43:21.223 --> 43:24.418
Well, I wanted to run through,
once again,

43:24.518 --> 43:26.394
your movements on June 21 st.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.645
June which?

43:28.856 --> 43:31.258
June 21 st.

43:31.358 --> 43:34.110
Now, deputy, we both know
what day we're talking about.

43:34.320 --> 43:38.698
Let's be civilized and the sooner
you can get back to your game

43:38.866 --> 43:40.575
and we can return to DC.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.588
Please, don't let me interrupt you.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.283
It's just when you've heard a question

43:56.383 --> 43:59.677
asked a dozen times, it gets boring.

44:00.387 --> 44:02.639
Yeah, I guess so.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.798
You don't eat together?

44:10.898 --> 44:12.482
He works funny hours.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.319
You think that's odd?

44:16.904 --> 44:17.904
No.

44:19.073 --> 44:21.199
I work funny hours myself.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.037
I eat when I'm hungry,
he eats when he can.

44:26.246 --> 44:29.582
- Can I get you something?
- No, thanks.

44:29.792 --> 44:33.002
Nice house.
How long have you lived here?

44:33.212 --> 44:35.046
I was born here.

44:35.255 --> 44:38.841
But my father lost the house
in a poker game a long time ago.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.596
We've been paying rent ever since.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.559
It's a wicked game.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.481
Poker.

44:54.733 --> 44:56.109
Wicked.

44:56.985 --> 44:58.861
Mr. Anderson?

45:01.407 --> 45:04.450
It was nice talking to you.
Guess I gotta go.

45:08.497 --> 45:11.525
Pork chops still any good?
Bring me a beer?

45:11.625 --> 45:12.959
Good night.

45:14.545 --> 45:17.797
Get back to baseball.
You know what they say?

45:18.006 --> 45:20.618
The only game a black man
can wave a stick...

45:20.718 --> 45:22.969
I already heard that one.

45:28.308 --> 45:31.602
Fifty minutes
of his alibi hinges on his wife.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.464
What's she like?

45:33.564 --> 45:34.939
She's a nice lady.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.693
Tell me, how does
a woman like that end up...

45:38.902 --> 45:40.653
With Shithead in there?

45:40.863 --> 45:45.199
You know what small towns are like.
A girl spends high school

45:45.409 --> 45:49.954
looking for a guy to marry,
then her whole life figuring out why.

45:50.164 --> 45:52.790
Something's wrong. He's too confident.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.585
Did you see the wedding photograph?

45:55.794 --> 45:59.406
His three usher pals
hooked their thumbs in their belts

45:59.506 --> 46:01.924
with three fingers pointing down.

46:02.342 --> 46:05.845
So, what is that?
Some sort of Masonic thing?

46:07.014 --> 46:09.015
KKK.

46:13.687 --> 46:16.048
I know you ain't drunk. I won't argue.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.524
I'm not drunk.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.945
I'll take you
where you can sleep it off.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.573
All right. Hold up.

46:27.993 --> 46:30.411
- Who's driving?
- Watch your head.

47:24.842 --> 47:25.842
Hi.

47:26.301 --> 47:29.971
There was a couple things
I need to check with you.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.166
My husband's not here.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.976
Actually, I wanted to talk to you.

47:35.727 --> 47:37.144
Me?

47:37.938 --> 47:41.357
Well, you better come in, then.

47:44.778 --> 47:46.445
Just take a minute.

47:46.655 --> 47:49.782
My boss, he's kind of a pain.
College kid.

47:49.950 --> 47:53.619
He has to dot all the i's,
cross all the t's.

47:53.787 --> 47:55.522
What do you want to ask me about?

47:55.622 --> 47:57.456
It's a time thing.

47:57.666 --> 47:59.526
A few things we're not clear about...

47:59.626 --> 48:02.670
Should I put your flowers in water?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.755
Actually, they're for you.

48:05.465 --> 48:07.910
They're beautiful.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.802
They are pretty, aren't they?

48:10.012 --> 48:12.805
Don't smell nice, but they're pretty.

48:13.557 --> 48:16.335
Would you like anything? Some tea?

48:16.435 --> 48:17.935
Yeah, I would. Thanks.

48:33.452 --> 48:36.579
Oh, don't look at that.
It's a terrible photo.

48:36.788 --> 48:39.498
Oh, I don't know about that.

48:39.833 --> 48:41.360
Is this recent?

48:41.460 --> 48:43.336
No. I wish.

48:43.503 --> 48:46.365
Well, this sure looks recent to me.

48:46.465 --> 48:48.716
We were married 14 years ago.

48:48.926 --> 48:52.995
Are you kidding me?
No, that... Come on!

48:53.347 --> 48:54.540
You take sugar?

48:54.640 --> 48:55.765
Sure do.

48:57.017 --> 48:59.211
I grew up in a town like this.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.520
You were smart enough to leave.

49:01.688 --> 49:03.757
Why didn't you?

49:03.857 --> 49:05.900
"For better or for worse."

49:09.529 --> 49:12.406
How about you? Are you married?

49:12.616 --> 49:13.741
Two.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.286
Well, I was, as I remember.

49:17.496 --> 49:20.414
It didn't last very long.
I was never home.

49:20.624 --> 49:24.377
I guess she got fed up
with phone calls from Miami

49:24.586 --> 49:27.213
and postcards from Des Moines.

49:27.589 --> 49:29.840
There was always a guy around.

49:30.592 --> 49:34.971
Any guy that could spare the time
for a movie or a beer

49:35.180 --> 49:37.264
or a quarter for the jukebox.

49:39.893 --> 49:41.560
She left.

49:45.691 --> 49:47.134
How about you?

49:47.234 --> 49:50.111
Oh, you know the South, Mr. Anderson.

49:50.779 --> 49:54.824
You graduate and marry
the first boy that makes you laugh.

49:55.033 --> 49:57.159
Your husband's quite a guy.

49:59.663 --> 50:03.833
You know, my boss has
this thing about an hour,

50:04.084 --> 50:08.421
50 minutes to be exact,
that your husband says he was with you.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.135
And I guess he was.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.012
Guess he was.

50:19.182 --> 50:21.058
Well, that's a pity.

50:22.602 --> 50:27.273
That means I don't have an excuse
for hanging around here anymore.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.693
Well...

50:32.029 --> 50:33.680
Thank you for the iced tea.

50:33.780 --> 50:35.448
Thank you for the flowers.

50:35.615 --> 50:36.824
Sure.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.620
Do you know what kind they are?

50:42.539 --> 50:45.025
They're called trumpet pitchers.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.333
Oh, that's right.

50:46.543 --> 50:50.463
My daddy called them ladies from hell
because they're car...

50:50.672 --> 50:52.199
Carnivorous.

50:52.299 --> 50:53.716
That's the word?

50:54.468 --> 50:56.828
See, that pretty color's the bait.

50:56.928 --> 50:59.831
Insects home in, and they're dead

50:59.931 --> 51:02.558
even before they got their shoes off.

51:05.645 --> 51:07.881
Should've picked something fitting.

51:07.981 --> 51:09.648
Maybe.

52:24.391 --> 52:27.210
May the peace and the joy
in the Holy Ghost

52:27.310 --> 52:30.354
abide with you for now
and forever. Amen.

52:34.442 --> 52:37.637
He sure did preach
a good sermon today.

53:39.674 --> 53:41.910
You already been told once, nigger!

53:42.010 --> 53:44.303
We don't want to tell you again!

53:44.512 --> 53:48.557
You flap them bootlips off
to any of them federal men,

53:48.767 --> 53:51.628
we'll put you in the ground, boy.

53:51.728 --> 53:54.104
And that's without a pine box!

53:55.523 --> 53:57.483
You understand me?

54:09.955 --> 54:12.498
How are Negroes treated in Mississippi?

54:12.707 --> 54:17.002
They're treated about fair.
About as good as they ought to be.

54:23.009 --> 54:27.554
If you ask me, niggers here have been
treated bad for a long time.

54:37.941 --> 54:41.277
I think Martin Luther King's
one of the leaders.

54:41.486 --> 54:44.280
J. Edgar Hoover said he was a Communist.

54:44.489 --> 54:48.617
They had proof to that effect,
but I don't know for sure.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.370
But that's what they say.

55:05.135 --> 55:07.303
You wanna find that nigger?

55:07.512 --> 55:12.850
They say we've got to eat together
and use the same bathrooms as the niggers.

55:13.059 --> 55:16.228
That's hard for some
Mississippi folks to do.

55:16.396 --> 55:20.316
They're not like us.
They don't take baths. They stink.

55:20.525 --> 55:22.234
They... They're nasty.

55:22.736 --> 55:24.903
They just not like white folks.

55:30.785 --> 55:32.812
What do you think happened to them?

55:32.912 --> 55:34.705
Dead.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.167
Just as dead as they can be.

55:39.085 --> 55:40.961
Feels so good.

55:43.465 --> 55:45.591
Is she asleep? Is she?

55:48.553 --> 55:51.430
I'm sorry I woke you up.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.501
Bye, hon. I'll be a couple hours.

55:54.601 --> 55:55.684
All right.

55:56.561 --> 55:59.271
Well, Mary, is that your Betsy's kid?

55:59.814 --> 56:03.359
Yeah, she's growing up
real quick, isn't she?

56:08.448 --> 56:09.656
Come on.

56:12.660 --> 56:15.245
Tuesday will be just fine on those.

56:20.752 --> 56:22.044
Funny.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.840
Their kids are so cute.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.557
- Here we go.
- That back on me again?

56:35.767 --> 56:39.645
If the Secret Service
couldn't protect the president,

56:39.813 --> 56:43.649
how the hell are we supposed
to protect a few nigras?

56:43.858 --> 56:48.612
It ain't nothing but low-life white trash
drinking too much alcohol.

56:48.822 --> 56:53.450
More like paint thinner,
because this state's as dry as a martini.

56:53.660 --> 56:55.828
We got the drunks to prove it.

56:57.214 --> 57:01.401
Give me a little room here.
Excuse me. Excuse me, Bob.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.946
- Is this okay?
- Your name, please?

57:05.046 --> 57:07.714
Clayton Townley, local businessman.

57:07.966 --> 57:11.969
Are you a spokesman for
the White Knights of the KKK?

57:12.387 --> 57:15.305
I told you. I'm a businessman.

57:15.515 --> 57:19.017
I'm also a Mississippian
and an American.

57:19.185 --> 57:22.354
I'm sick and tired
of the way Mississippians

57:22.522 --> 57:25.983
are having our views distorted
by you media people.

57:26.192 --> 57:28.193
So let's get this straight.

57:28.361 --> 57:32.030
We do not accept Jews
because they reject Christ.

57:32.198 --> 57:37.369
Their control of international banking
cartels are at the root of Communism.

57:37.579 --> 57:41.165
We do not accept papists
who bow to a Roman dictator.

57:41.374 --> 57:45.169
We don't accept Turks,
Mongols, Tartars, Orientals or Negroes.

57:45.378 --> 57:50.817
We're here to protect Anglo-Saxon
democracy and the American way.

57:50.917 --> 57:52.751
Thank you, sir.

57:55.263 --> 57:59.391
Lester, you are living proof
that cousins shouldn't fuck.

58:02.020 --> 58:04.855
There's this colored boy.

58:05.064 --> 58:08.233
He wants to play football
for Bear Bryant.

58:08.401 --> 58:10.929
Bear says, "I'll give you a tryout."

58:11.029 --> 58:12.196
What color was he?

58:12.405 --> 58:15.199
What's he gonna run with? A watermelon?

58:15.909 --> 58:18.327
And he'll keep on running too.

58:18.536 --> 58:21.455
He says, "Get down there
on one goal line."

58:21.664 --> 58:24.458
The other team's on the other goal line.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.319
He throws the boy the ball...

58:32.091 --> 58:33.910
Are you open?

58:34.010 --> 58:35.761
You gotta be a member to drink here.

58:36.429 --> 58:37.804
Member?

58:38.932 --> 58:40.182
A member of what?

58:44.103 --> 58:46.605
Member of the social club.

58:46.814 --> 58:48.732
Thought you'd buy me a beer.

58:50.777 --> 58:52.778
Give him a beer, Frank.

58:56.491 --> 58:59.243
Nice to be back in a dry county again.

58:59.452 --> 59:02.412
When I was sheriff,
half my take-home pay

59:02.622 --> 59:07.543
was from collecting taxes on illegal jukes.
Works the same here.

59:07.752 --> 59:12.005
You haul in a tidy penny here,
winking at the bootleggers.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.033
I wouldn't know nothing about that.

59:14.133 --> 59:15.968
Yeah.

59:16.135 --> 59:17.719
A tidy penny.

59:20.723 --> 59:22.625
Got anything stronger, deputy?

59:22.725 --> 59:24.434
No, we ain't.

59:25.144 --> 59:30.482
Oh. In Thornton, Mississippi,
there's a joy juice still in every yard.

59:32.527 --> 59:36.488
All you need is corn, sugar,
and a pot to boil it in.

59:37.657 --> 59:40.367
I tried to take this boy's fingerprints.

59:40.577 --> 59:43.161
He had his hands in a mash barrel.

59:43.371 --> 59:46.164
There was no skin. He had no prints.

59:46.499 --> 59:49.918
We ain't interested in your
Mississippi stories.

59:50.128 --> 59:52.113
You ain't from here no more.

59:53.881 --> 59:55.716
Why'd you leave, anyway?

59:55.925 --> 59:59.428
Well, I just wanted a change of scenery.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.725
Grits started leaving
a bad taste in my mouth.

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:10.772
If that's how you feel, Mr. FBI Man,
why don't you get the hell out?

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.734
Go back to your Commie,
nigger-loving boss.

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:16.653
You must not know my boss, Mr. Hoover.

01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:20.324
He's not too fond of Commies.
He'd be on your side.

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.369
I don't give two shits
whose side he's on.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:29.541
We got 5,000 niggers in this county
who ain't registered to vote yet.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.586
And they never will.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:39.343
Tell your stiff suits in Washington, D.C,
that they ain't gonna change us

01:00:39.552 --> 01:00:43.706
unless it's over my dead body.
Or a lot of dead niggers.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.812
You'd kill? Is that what you're saying?

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:55.233
I wouldn't think twice about it.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:00:58.862
No court in Mississippi
would convict me for it.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:02.908
How about you, deputy?
How are you with wringing necks?

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:05.577
Keep pushing me, Hoover boy.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.996
You get this straight, you fucker!

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:13.293
Tell your queer nigger bosses
they ain't gonna find civil righters here.

01:01:13.503 --> 01:01:17.657
Pack your bags and head back
up north where you belong.

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:25.681
You get this straight, shitkicker,
don't you mistake me for somebody else.

01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:28.334
You got brains in your dick.

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:31.019
We'll be here till it's finished.

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.440
How about you, Deputy?

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:39.111
Is that gun just for show?

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:42.781
Or do you get to shoot
people once in a while?

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.957
Thanks for the beer.

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:01.800
Ask them if they wanna
help save this country

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:04.886
from the onslaught of integration.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:09.599
They want to throw white children
and colored children

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.602
into the melting pot of integration

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:15.313
out of which will come a conglomerated

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:18.316
mulato, mongrel class of people!

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.862
Both races will be destroyed.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:27.200
I, for one, under God
will die before I'll yield one inch

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.728
to that kind of a movement in America.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.291
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.296
They've been on the radio all day,
talking about FBI intimidation.

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:43.216
We're not thugs, Mr. Anderson.
We'll do this my way!

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:44.827
I know, bureau procedure.

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:47.429
What the hell were you doing
at the beauty parlor?

01:02:48.055 --> 01:02:51.683
If that's Bureau business,
I want to know.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:53.086
Do you understand me?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.394
Get in here!

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:58.690
Know what your problem is?

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.360
You don't know when to speak
and when to shut up!

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:06.531
Mrs. Pell ain't gonna say anything!

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.700
I'm not gonna choke it out!

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:13.246
This can of worms only
opens from the inside.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.045
I know that.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:32.766
Freedom! Freedom!

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:44.736
White nigger!

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:51.034
Hurry up!

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:49.217
- Hi.
- Hey, now.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.554
Just passing by and saying hello.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:55.082
You're not out watching the parade?

01:04:55.182 --> 01:04:56.975
How come you didn't ask me
any questions?

01:04:57.184 --> 01:04:59.644
Everybody's been asked except me.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:06.818
Why don't you send some cute
FBI boys to talk to me?

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.488
Sorry about the intrusion.

01:05:11.657 --> 01:05:12.850
Pecan?

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:14.409
I'm sick of pecans.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.370
Freedom! Freedom!

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:20.266
You willing to stand up and fight?

01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:21.750
Yes! Yes!

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:39.559
Freedom! Freedom!

01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:45.857
Equality! Equality!

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.702
How'd you find out about this?

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:01.607
Bureau procedure, Mr. Ward.

01:06:13.177 --> 01:06:15.220
Sheriff Stuckey.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.973
He got his phone call.

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:23.019
Wonder who else was called.

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.773
Where're you going, boy?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.151
Go on. Go on, get out of here.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.086
Here they come.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.304
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.765
We'll wait until they go inside.

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:03.085
Get him!

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:09.733
Get him in the truck now!

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.152
Get inside, you sons of bitches.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:15.681
Let's go!

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:17.449
Wait until they're inside!

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.123
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.694
- Turn left.
- How come?

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:38.238
Don't know, just turn left.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:44.035
There's the truck.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.621
Go up that little road.

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.544
Stop. Stop right here.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:29.747
What's wrong with these people?

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:44.261
Mrs. Walker, I know this is difficult,
but I need your help.

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:48.183
If you could persuade your son
to press charges

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:51.769
then we could pick up
the deputy right away.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:54.272
He won't talk to no one.

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.383
It won't do no good anyway.

01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:58.318
I promise it will.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.612
Leave him alone.

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:03.531
Maybe then, they'll let us alone.

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.629
If this is a pattern,

01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:21.674
at least we know what happened
on June 21 st.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.470
Pell stopped the boys
for speeding at 3:00.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.806
He held them while the Klan
got organized.

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:31.059
He released them at 10:30.

01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:33.603
By then, his buddies were ready.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:36.549
I think he went with them.

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.149
You think he'll crack?

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.653
Down here, rattlesnakes
don't commit suicide.

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:55.667
Did you release the three
civil rights workers to the Klan

01:10:55.876 --> 01:10:57.585
on the night of June 21 st?

01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.405
No.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:02.674
- Are you a member of the Klan?
- No.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:05.077
Were you ever a member?

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:06.678
No.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:09.999
Do you know the term Grand Cyclops?

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.625
I've heard of it.

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:15.838
Were you the Grand Cyclops
of the Mississippi Klavern

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:19.175
of the White Knights
for the past three years?

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:23.236
Objection. He said he's
not a member of the Klan.

01:11:23.445 --> 01:11:28.408
Objection? This is just an interview.
No need to be so formal.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:31.577
Then I don't have to stay here, do I?

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:33.705
I got work to do.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.376
You do, too.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:41.713
Yes, sir. And you can be sure
we'll do it.

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:43.715
Good luck.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:48.428
You get enough to indict me,
you know where I am.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.225
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:56.769
Don't you worry about a thing.

01:11:58.158 --> 01:11:59.772
Are you gonna be indicted?

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:02.483
Does the FBI have evidence?

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.887
Are you cooperating
in this investigation?

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.030
Yes, just like we've done all along.

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:13.578
Sir, could you not do that, please?
Do not do that, please!

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:17.282
Get the fuck out of here!

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:24.255
We have to tell you again?
Go back where you belong!

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.257
Get out of my face!

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:29.218
Get out and leave us alone!

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:34.140
Go home! You're gonna get hurt now.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.854
This is getting to be more
than we can take!

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.423
I can't take this.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.716
Not now, sir.

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:43.816
Just a minute.

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.820
I resent your pursuit of my department!

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.532
You keep implicating them
in these disappearances

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:56.454
but there's no evidence that they
were involved with any crime!

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:59.415
We want the truth! It's frustrating!

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.960
Anyone can point a finger.
That ain't evidence!

01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:07.131
Us old cotton-choppers still
believe in democracy!

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.676
And we know our rights!

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.763
You do.
I'll bet a cotton-chopping dollar on it.

01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:19.685
Anderson, you're so far up my nose
I can feel your boots on my chin.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:25.400
I'm telling you again, a couple
of crazies dressed in bed sheets

01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:29.028
dancing around scaring Negroes
is not the fault

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:30.806
of the entire state!

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:33.825
There are three dead kids

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:36.687
because of your department.

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.538
So get used to having us around.

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:42.166
Get used to my boots on your chin too.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.585
You people better back off!

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:48.798
Goddamn FBI! Who do they think they are?

01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:50.534
Coming here...

01:13:50.634 --> 01:13:51.843
Do you have a statement?

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:53.803
Goddamn right I do!

01:13:54.012 --> 01:13:56.222
For a moment there, Mr. Anderson,

01:13:57.015 --> 01:14:00.461
it sounded like we were both
on the same side.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.281
Are you all right?

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.548
I'm fine.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.159
Let me know if you need anything.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:34.135
I will.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.304
Mama! Mama, come quick!

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:19.892
No sign of him, sir. He's long gone.

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:23.729
His mother lives across the street.
She won't talk.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:27.290
I want the whole area covered.
Someone saw it.

01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:28.734
They won't talk to us.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:33.004
Get going, Mr. Bird. If they won't
talk to us, shake it out of them.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.634
Let's go. Every house. Come on.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.684
What?

01:16:47.102 --> 01:16:51.397
Sending these white guys
around with their notebooks

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.383
is gonna get you nowhere.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:56.277
Okay. What would you do?

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.867
It's okay to be afraid.

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.918
Go on, Willie,

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:15.546
tell them what you saw.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.374
The defendants will rise.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:58.589
In this country,
a man's home is his castle.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:04.095
That is one of the principles
by which this community survives.

01:18:04.262 --> 01:18:07.306
You men have done violence
to that principle,

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:12.728
but the court understands
that your crimes

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.730
have been, to some extent,

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:18.677
brought about by outside influences.

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:34.667
Outsiders have come into Jessup County
and they've been people of low morality

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.962
and unhygienic.

01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:41.590
Their presence has provoked
a lot of people.

01:18:44.302 --> 01:18:50.375
So the court understands,
without condoning them, mind you,

01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:55.146
that the crimes
to which you men have pled guilty were

01:18:56.022 --> 01:18:59.775
provoked by these outside influences.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:04.989
So I'm gonna make your punishment light.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.327
I'm gonna sentence you each
to five years.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:18.403
But I'm gonna suspend these sentences.

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:54.038
You can't go in there, sir.

01:19:54.706 --> 01:19:56.858
FBI. Let us through.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:59.084
Sorry, sir. You can't go in there.

01:20:04.549 --> 01:20:06.133
Sheriff?

01:20:09.846 --> 01:20:12.431
You started something this time.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:15.059
I want to talk to them.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:16.795
No.

01:20:16.895 --> 01:20:18.729
This ain't nothing we can't handle.

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.591
Just crazy coloreds tearing up shit.

01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:23.442
Local problem.

01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:41.418
Look at those flames, Mr. Ward.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:44.839
That's why they sent you here?

01:20:45.048 --> 01:20:47.633
It would've happened anyway.

01:20:49.219 --> 01:20:53.013
If I was a Negro,
I'd think the same way they do.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.708
If you were a Negro,

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:58.018
nobody would give a damn
what you thought.

01:21:54.659 --> 01:21:56.702
Aaron, Aaron, get up!

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.288
Take everyone out the back door.

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:03.709
When you hit the road, keep going.
You understand?

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:08.213
Nathan! Come on! Get up, Nathan!

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:10.408
Get out the bed!

01:22:10.508 --> 01:22:12.051
What's happening?

01:22:13.136 --> 01:22:16.513
Come on, Mama! Let's go! Come on, Mama!

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:19.725
Come on, y'all!

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.294
Get up, child.

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:22.728
Come on, Grandma!

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:24.521
Let's go!

01:22:39.704 --> 01:22:41.121
Who's there?

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:45.042
If you're in there, come on out.
You hear?

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.466
I ain't taking this shit no more!

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:55.112
You'll be okay, Papa.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.573
Mama and the girls are fine.

01:23:57.782 --> 01:23:59.491
They cracked your head.

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:03.370
Just keep on breathing.
Don't you go dying on me.

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:05.372
You hear me?

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:08.542
You're gonna be just fine.

01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:38.155
Cows won't run away.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:40.824
No one knows why. They're stupid.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:46.205
They just stand there until their
bellies swell up and they pop.

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:48.957
They have relatives in Detroit.

01:24:49.959 --> 01:24:51.569
Are they gonna go?

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.670
I didn't give them any choice.

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.216
We know who did this.

01:24:58.176 --> 01:24:59.619
We did.

01:24:59.719 --> 01:25:01.413
It's progress.

01:25:01.513 --> 01:25:04.932
Twenty years ago, they'd be strung up
for stealing watermelons.

01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:10.104
I don't understand you, Mr. Anderson.
Not at all.

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:13.023
Let's get something straight.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:17.111
This was fucked up when we
turned it into a news show.

01:25:17.529 --> 01:25:19.988
When the three kids vanished,
it was news.

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:24.451
When the three civil rights workers
vanished, it was news.

01:25:24.661 --> 01:25:27.788
They're just kids.
They're still missing.

01:25:27.997 --> 01:25:32.709
What's missing is the 50 minutes
Pell said he was with his wife.

01:25:36.256 --> 01:25:37.965
Okay.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:55.732
I love Mississippi.

01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:11.582
They hate Mississippi.

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.169
They hate us because we present

01:26:15.378 --> 01:26:20.090
a shining example of
successful segregation.

01:26:20.258 --> 01:26:24.761
These northern students,
with their atheist, Communist bosses,

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:28.807
that have come into our community

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:33.187
this week, have taken a terrible blow.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:37.191
This week, their cause
has been crippled.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:41.945
These federal policemen you see
prying into our lives

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:47.117
have learned that they
are powerless against us

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:51.455
if every single Anglo-Saxon
Christian one of us

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:52.789
stands together!

01:26:58.171 --> 01:26:59.504
This week...

01:27:01.633 --> 01:27:03.425
We have company, sir.

01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:06.637
This is a political meeting.

01:27:06.804 --> 01:27:08.456
Doesn't smell that way to me.

01:27:08.556 --> 01:27:10.474
It's a political meeting!

01:27:11.643 --> 01:27:16.563
Oh, it looks like a political meeting,
but smells more like Klan to me

01:27:16.814 --> 01:27:19.983
with or without the Halloween costumes.

01:27:20.818 --> 01:27:22.319
Gentlemen.

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:26.198
In the courts of Mississippi,
they've been reminded

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:32.120
that they cannot turn our communities
into their communities.

01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:36.667
Communities in which Negroes
run riot, unrestrained

01:27:36.876 --> 01:27:39.211
as they do in Harlem

01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.088
or they do in Oakland

01:27:41.297 --> 01:27:43.340
or they do in the streets of Chicago!

01:29:04.630 --> 01:29:06.423
Can I come in?

01:29:14.932 --> 01:29:17.142
It's not good for you to be here.

01:29:17.352 --> 01:29:18.769
Why?

01:29:18.978 --> 01:29:20.562
It's ugly.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:23.732
This whole thing is so ugly.

01:29:24.233 --> 01:29:27.778
Do you know what it's like
to live with all this?

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:33.867
People look at us and only see
bigots and racists.

01:29:35.578 --> 01:29:38.372
Hatred isn't something you're born with.

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:40.791
It gets taught.

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:46.880
At school, they said
segregation was in the Bible.

01:29:48.049 --> 01:29:52.719
Genesis 9, verse 27.

01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:57.182
At seven years of age,

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.977
you get told it enough, you believe it.

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:04.147
You believe the hatred.

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:09.486
You live it, you breathe it.

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.365
You marry it.

01:30:43.438 --> 01:30:46.215
My husband drove one of the cars
that night.

01:30:47.525 --> 01:30:50.527
That's what you wanted
to hear, isn't it?

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:54.865
The bodies are buried
on the Roberts' Farm

01:30:55.074 --> 01:30:57.534
in an earthen dam.

01:31:15.178 --> 01:31:16.761
Sir.

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:31.693
Take a break, Mr. Bird.

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:34.821
Put some handkerchiefs on your faces.

01:31:52.089 --> 01:31:53.757
Make way, folks.

01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:08.271
The missing civil rights
workers were found

01:32:08.439 --> 01:32:10.106
at an undisclosed grave.

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:16.404
Neither the FBI nor Sheriff's
Department will comment.

01:32:16.822 --> 01:32:19.533
The bodies are at Jessup County Hospital

01:32:19.742 --> 01:32:21.743
where officials refuse to comment.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:26.456
There is speculation
that an autopsy will be performed.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:30.293
Keep it open.

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:33.547
Coming through. Open it up.

01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:37.092
Hold it back.

01:32:57.196 --> 01:33:00.156
Clinton, you got some problems at home.

01:33:00.324 --> 01:33:01.726
What do you mean?

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:04.869
Pull your head out your ass
and get home!

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:07.190
I, Vincent Thompson,

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:10.917
am the cheddar cheese champion
of the world.

01:33:11.377 --> 01:33:14.671
In international competition,

01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:18.174
my cheddar won first prize
based on flavor,

01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:21.344
texture, appearance, and color.

01:33:21.554 --> 01:33:25.473
I've been a cheesemaker since I was 17.

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:28.685
I didn't expect you home so early.

01:33:30.521 --> 01:33:32.355
Hi, Frank.

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:46.661
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:00.675
Sir.

01:34:03.512 --> 01:34:05.263
Say again.

01:34:06.891 --> 01:34:09.017
I'll be right there.

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.899
- Mr. Bird.
- Yes, sir?

01:34:16.108 --> 01:34:19.027
Get five men and meet me outside.

01:34:20.613 --> 01:34:21.806
Where's Anderson?

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:23.573
He's at the motel.

01:34:28.579 --> 01:34:29.829
Take the front door.

01:34:30.039 --> 01:34:32.540
If anyone comes in, break them down.

01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:34.250
Take the corridor.

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.336
- Mr. Bird.
- Sir?

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.257
Okay. Go get Anderson. Bring him here.

01:34:41.425 --> 01:34:45.095
Don't tell him anything. Get him here.

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.879
Mr. Anderson, stop!

01:35:20.089 --> 01:35:21.548
- Mr. Anderson!
- Go to hell!

01:35:21.757 --> 01:35:23.717
I'm telling you to stop.

01:35:23.843 --> 01:35:25.135
We're not killers.

01:35:25.302 --> 01:35:27.455
The difference between them and us.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.972
Them and you.

01:35:29.181 --> 01:35:30.640
You're not like them.

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:35.061
What do you care what I do to
someone hiding behind a badge?

01:35:35.271 --> 01:35:36.964
Aren't you changing the world?

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:38.356
Yes.

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.483
You're arrogant and stupid!

01:35:40.693 --> 01:35:42.219
You're changing it, too.

01:35:42.319 --> 01:35:43.945
I am right now.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:48.392
Don't mess this up because you're
fooling around with witnesses.

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:49.576
You!

01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:00.795
That don't mean shit.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:03.506
I'll kill you if you don't listen.

01:36:03.674 --> 01:36:04.950
Fuck you.

01:36:05.050 --> 01:36:06.301
Let me go.

01:36:06.510 --> 01:36:09.345
Let me go.

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:11.890
We'll go after them together.

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:13.584
You wouldn't know how.

01:36:13.684 --> 01:36:15.059
You'll teach me.

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:17.004
You don't have the guts.

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:19.856
I have the guts and the authority.

01:36:20.065 --> 01:36:22.009
What does that mean?

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.777
New rules.

01:36:23.986 --> 01:36:27.322
We nail them any way. Even your way.

01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:29.975
Is this you or someone else?

01:36:30.075 --> 01:36:31.743
Both.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:35.413
We do it my way with my people!

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.957
Whatever it takes.

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:40.794
Okay.

01:36:47.176 --> 01:36:48.968
Give me a minute.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:58.629
Would he have shot me?

01:36:58.729 --> 01:37:00.271
Yes, sir.

01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:03.733
He's a ballsy bastard, isn't he?

01:37:11.742 --> 01:37:16.814
They want me to say
that two white boys also died

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:19.541
helping Negroes help themselves.

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:24.128
They want me to say

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:28.591
we mourn with the mothers
of these two white boys.

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:33.137
But the State of Mississippi

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:39.394
won't allow these boys to be buried
in the same cemetery as this Negro boy.

01:37:41.814 --> 01:37:46.276
I say, I have no more love to give.

01:37:46.443 --> 01:37:53.032
I have only anger in my heart today,
and I want you to be angry with me!

01:37:53.242 --> 01:37:58.913
I am sick, and I am tired,
and I want you to be sick and tired!

01:37:59.123 --> 01:38:04.544
I am sick and tired
of going to funerals of black men

01:38:04.795 --> 01:38:07.130
who've been murdered by white men.

01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:11.301
I am sick and tired of
the people of this country

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:15.388
who continue to allow
these things to happen.

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:20.143
What is an "unalienable right"
if you are a Negro?

01:38:20.352 --> 01:38:23.730
What does "equal treatment
under the law" mean?

01:38:23.939 --> 01:38:29.193
What does it mean
"liberty and justice for all"?

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:34.324
Now I say to these people,
look at this young man

01:38:34.533 --> 01:38:37.619
and you'll see the face of a black man,

01:38:37.828 --> 01:38:40.663
but if you look at the blood, it's red!

01:38:40.831 --> 01:38:45.376
It is like yours! It is just like yours!

01:40:14.883 --> 01:40:15.925
You.

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:21.806
I'm going to tell you a story.

01:40:22.933 --> 01:40:27.729
A kid named Homer Wilkes,
lives about 30 miles north of here.

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:33.234
He'd taken his girl home
and was walking back along the road

01:40:34.069 --> 01:40:35.778
when a car pulled up.

01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:40.116
Three white boys took him for a ride.

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:44.954
Now,

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.624
he hadn't done anything

01:40:50.335 --> 01:40:51.502
except

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:55.631
be a Negro.

01:40:58.177 --> 01:41:00.386
They took him to a shack.

01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.807
A shack like this one.

01:41:04.975 --> 01:41:07.310
They took out a razor blade.

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:11.606
Regular razor blade like this one.

01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:17.195
They pulled down his pants,

01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:22.325
they spread his legs

01:41:24.286 --> 01:41:26.996
and they sliced off his scrotum.

01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:32.502
Put it in a coffee cup.

01:41:37.216 --> 01:41:42.678
Do you know how you bleed
when somebody cuts off your balls?

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:49.894
Homer looked like

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:53.564
he'd been dipped in blood
up to his waist.

01:41:53.816 --> 01:41:57.193
He was barely alive when
he got to the hospital.

01:41:57.361 --> 01:41:59.821
He can hardly walk now.

01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:12.917
Mayor, we know you know who was there

01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:16.045
when those civil rights boys was killed.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.257
You know who pulled the trigger.

01:42:25.097 --> 01:42:27.598
You want to say something to me?

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:35.731
Okay.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:42.890
Is he with the Bureau?

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.074
He's a specialist.

01:42:45.242 --> 01:42:46.769
The mayor won't talk?

01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:48.327
They'd kill him.

01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:50.773
What do you have?

01:42:50.873 --> 01:42:53.207
Three cars, seven men involved.

01:42:53.417 --> 01:42:54.651
Pell and Bailey killed them.

01:42:54.751 --> 01:42:55.918
Stuckey?

01:42:56.086 --> 01:42:59.505
He's too smart to be there. Pell did it.

01:42:59.798 --> 01:43:00.908
And Townley?

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.091
It was his idea.

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:04.594
Grand Dragons don't get dirty.

01:43:04.803 --> 01:43:08.931
The whole thing? Bullet by bullet.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.309
Are you interested

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:16.272
in words like coercion
or hearsay or duress?

01:43:16.481 --> 01:43:18.842
This is no good in court.

01:43:18.942 --> 01:43:20.735
We're not in court.

01:43:20.944 --> 01:43:24.822
We won't get them on murder.
That's a state charge.

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.616
They won't prosecute.

01:43:26.783 --> 01:43:29.952
We've got to get them in Federal Court.

01:43:30.162 --> 01:43:31.522
Violation of civil rights!

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:34.123
You're violating rights!

01:43:34.291 --> 01:43:36.110
Don't put me on your perch!

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:38.127
Don't drag me in your gutter!

01:43:38.295 --> 01:43:41.130
These people crawled out of the sewer!

01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.008
Maybe the gutter's where we should be!

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:51.349
Thank you.

01:44:15.332 --> 01:44:17.416
This better be important.

01:44:25.842 --> 01:44:27.718
Who called this meeting?

01:44:31.056 --> 01:44:32.515
We thought you did.

01:44:32.683 --> 01:44:34.767
Of this group? Are you stupid?

01:44:34.977 --> 01:44:36.811
You didn't call this?

01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.422
Who the fuck did?

01:44:38.522 --> 01:44:39.897
Shut up!

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:41.466
Wait!

01:44:41.566 --> 01:44:43.484
Is this a bullshit setup?

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.736
Ray, you didn't call this?

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:49.532
I got a note from you and Clinton.

01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:51.325
Lester, shut up!

01:44:53.912 --> 01:44:58.207
Now, we're all gonna
walk straight out of here

01:44:58.417 --> 01:45:00.418
and say nothing.

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.878
That means nothing, Lester.

01:45:03.088 --> 01:45:04.740
You speak, you're dead.

01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:06.424
Shut up.

01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:09.010
Hey, Clinton.

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:14.390
Clinton?

01:45:17.853 --> 01:45:21.605
The rattlesnakes are starting
to commit suicide.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:51.093
Hi, Lester.

01:45:56.516 --> 01:45:58.517
We'll give you that ride home.

01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:01.672
What?

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:03.105
I know you said 4:30.

01:46:03.273 --> 01:46:05.232
We're running late.

01:46:05.942 --> 01:46:07.761
I'll meet you in the car.

01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:09.653
You're cracked.

01:46:10.947 --> 01:46:13.100
You have change for a $20?

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.618
Sure.

01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.334
Get in the car, Lester.

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:27.463
Or it'll be hard picking your
nose once I shut this drawer.

01:46:31.259 --> 01:46:35.763
You could make it easier on yourself
by going on the record.

01:46:35.972 --> 01:46:38.265
I ain't got nothing to say.

01:46:38.475 --> 01:46:41.394
You're barking up
the wrong tree, mister.

01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:44.105
I've got to tell you something.

01:46:44.314 --> 01:46:48.192
We've got you cold. Your buddies talked.

01:46:49.611 --> 01:46:51.320
You're lying.

01:46:56.493 --> 01:46:58.202
You're in a lot of trouble.

01:46:58.412 --> 01:47:02.581
You drove the second vehicle,
the green truck.

01:47:02.791 --> 01:47:04.917
Your buddy... Refresh my memory.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:08.170
"Lester dragged the Negro from the car

01:47:08.338 --> 01:47:09.839
"and shot him."

01:47:10.048 --> 01:47:11.575
That's a lie!

01:47:11.675 --> 01:47:13.509
It's true. What else, Mr. Bird?

01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:18.556
He said, "They only left me a nigger,
but at least I shot one."

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.478
I didn't kill him.
I shot him in the ass.

01:47:24.688 --> 01:47:28.315
He was already dead when
you put a slug in him.

01:47:28.525 --> 01:47:32.820
Your buddy tells it
that you killed the kid.

01:47:33.029 --> 01:47:35.239
Go on the record for us

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:39.160
or it's your ass,
not just a black kid's!

01:47:53.216 --> 01:47:55.176
Think about it, Lester.

01:47:55.594 --> 01:47:57.052
Come on out of there.

01:47:58.805 --> 01:48:00.556
Come on out.

01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:46.602
This is tricky.

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:50.940
They make it look so easy, don't they?

01:48:51.733 --> 01:48:54.276
I got a question for you, Clinton.

01:48:55.445 --> 01:48:58.447
You don't mind if I call you Clinton?

01:48:58.657 --> 01:49:01.367
I feel like I know you so well.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.164
The way we have it,
on the night of the murders,

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:11.293
you made a speech as you
buried the kids in the dam.

01:49:11.461 --> 01:49:15.381
How does Lester tell it?
"Mississippi would be proud.

01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:18.384
"You've struck a blow
for the white man."

01:49:18.593 --> 01:49:21.220
Is that what you said?

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:26.517
Is that what you said?
It must have been you.

01:49:26.726 --> 01:49:31.981
Clayton Townley and Ray Stuckey
were too smart to be there.

01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:36.193
You didn't think anyone would remember.

01:49:36.987 --> 01:49:40.056
But old Lester, he got a good memory.

01:49:43.994 --> 01:49:48.163
I'm sorry. I haven't done this
for a long time.

01:49:48.373 --> 01:49:49.983
Did you make a speech

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:53.603
the night you beat up your wife?

01:49:53.703 --> 01:49:55.529
Did you?

01:49:56.298 --> 01:49:59.117
Did you strike a blow
for the white man that night?

01:50:03.597 --> 01:50:06.390
You got a stupid smile. You know that?

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:08.434
Can you see it?

01:50:10.645 --> 01:50:15.524
Did you smile when the bulldozer
ran over the body? Did you?

01:50:19.237 --> 01:50:22.865
Did you smile when
the bodies were covered over?

01:50:23.366 --> 01:50:25.826
Get up here. Come on!

01:50:26.036 --> 01:50:30.539
Did you smile that same stupid smile?
Did you?

01:50:36.087 --> 01:50:39.340
Did you smile, Pell? Did you smile?

01:50:47.891 --> 01:50:50.309
Make no mistake, Deputy.

01:50:50.518 --> 01:50:52.629
I'll cut your head off

01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:55.773
and not give a shit how it
reads in the report.

01:51:18.588 --> 01:51:21.757
One more bite. One more bite.

01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:24.718
One more bite, darling. One more bite.

01:51:41.444 --> 01:51:44.180
Shit, Lester! What is going on?

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.741
Get in the bedroom and lock the door!

01:51:47.867 --> 01:51:50.035
Stay away from the windows!

01:53:06.696 --> 01:53:10.115
Please! Please! I didn't say a thing!

01:53:10.325 --> 01:53:13.118
It's a setup! I didn't say nothing!

01:53:14.496 --> 01:53:17.623
Nothing! I didn't say nothing!

01:53:17.832 --> 01:53:19.374
I didn't say nothing!

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:28.634
I didn't say nothing!

01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:52.267
You're lucky we been watching your ass.

01:53:55.119 --> 01:53:59.623
If you go on the record,
we'll give you protection.

01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:00.833
If not...

01:54:01.042 --> 01:54:04.753
If not, they're gonna kill you anyway.

01:54:04.963 --> 01:54:08.799
Oh! You need a toilet, Lester.

01:54:33.032 --> 01:54:35.409
Really had him going.

01:55:19.537 --> 01:55:22.372
We'll take care of the check.

01:55:46.731 --> 01:55:49.608
Well, I suppose I'll be back for supper.

01:57:16.946 --> 01:57:18.613
Why did he do it?

01:57:19.282 --> 01:57:22.034
He wasn't even in on it.

01:57:22.243 --> 01:57:23.952
He wasn't even Klan.

01:57:24.495 --> 01:57:27.456
Mr. Bird, he was guilty.

01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:31.877
Anyone's guilty who watches this
happen and pretends it isn't.

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:36.423
No, he was guilty, all right.

01:57:36.841 --> 01:57:40.260
As guilty as the ones
who pulled the trigger.

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:44.014
Maybe we all are.

01:58:38.361 --> 01:58:39.361
Hello?

01:58:41.405 --> 01:58:42.739
Yeah.

01:58:49.539 --> 01:58:54.042
I just missed you at the hospital.
They said you'd gone home.

01:58:55.002 --> 01:58:57.087
What's left of it.

01:58:58.548 --> 01:59:00.048
I'm real sorry.

01:59:00.508 --> 01:59:02.384
So am I.

01:59:03.177 --> 01:59:04.662
What are you gonna do?

01:59:04.762 --> 01:59:06.429
I don't know.

01:59:08.891 --> 01:59:10.501
Where will you go?

01:59:10.601 --> 01:59:12.310
I'm not going anywhere.

01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.021
This is my home. Born here.

01:59:16.691 --> 01:59:18.567
Probably die here.

01:59:22.071 --> 01:59:25.740
If I wanted to leave
I would've done it a long time ago.

01:59:26.367 --> 01:59:28.201
Things will work out.

01:59:28.619 --> 01:59:32.330
There's enough people here
know what I did was right.

01:59:33.166 --> 01:59:36.084
Ladies like the way I fix their hair.

01:59:52.059 --> 01:59:53.059
Hey.

01:59:55.188 --> 02:00:00.108
If you're ever in Des Moines,
don't send me a postcard.

02:00:10.786 --> 02:00:16.291
We cannot see

02:00:16.792 --> 02:00:18.877
In the future

02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:24.090
No, no, no, no, no

02:00:25.092 --> 02:00:28.011
And it's hard

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:31.973
To smile

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:35.936
Through trials

02:00:37.313 --> 02:00:40.190
No we

02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:44.236
cannot see

02:00:44.987 --> 02:00:48.949
Every pitfall

02:00:51.827 --> 02:00:55.038
But we must walk on

02:00:55.748 --> 02:00:58.625
By faith

02:00:59.377 --> 02:01:04.464
Each day oh, Lord!

02:01:06.467 --> 02:01:12.013
Woah, on Monday

02:01:13.266 --> 02:01:16.226
Walk on

02:01:17.061 --> 02:01:19.729
And on Tuesday

02:01:19.855 --> 02:01:22.633
Walk on

02:01:22.733 --> 02:01:29.698
Woah, let Jesus be

02:01:29.865 --> 02:01:31.267
Let me him be your

02:01:31.367 --> 02:01:35.370
Your guide

02:01:35.746 --> 02:01:37.539
Whoo!

02:01:37.707 --> 02:01:40.818
He's able to

02:01:40.918 --> 02:01:43.878
He can carry your load

02:01:44.046 --> 02:01:47.966
And he can see way down the road

02:01:48.843 --> 02:01:49.843
Ooh!

02:01:50.219 --> 02:01:55.374
Walk on by faith...

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.392
You want to drive, Rupert?

02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:01.354
Yeah.
