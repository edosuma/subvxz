20:51.500 --> 20:53.710
Tech did a double up.
Why can't we do a full up?

22:01.737 --> 22:03.864
Watch my hands
and tell me if I'm not catching like this.

22:05.032 --> 22:07.117
Thank you for the negativity.
Thank you.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.205
Bro, I wanna be out there.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.521
Kings and queens,
that's all there is here.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.706
Do you know who Gabi Butler is?

25:49.381 --> 25:50.966
Everyone knows that.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.493
I'd be cute with it.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.246
Why are you not going
to Shannon's later?

31:32.849 --> 31:34.684
I'm pretty sure
the whole team is on it.

36:30.229 --> 36:31.439
Cubs is Mini 2.

39:43.964 --> 39:47.134
Yeah, his walk's good, but he don't--
I feel like there's not enough jiggle.

44:06.769 --> 44:08.479
What do you know
about the Navarro cheerleaders?

46:17.274 --> 46:18.358
Did you know

46:18.442 --> 46:22.404
that Navarro is one of the top collegiate
cheer teams in the USA?

51:12.819 --> 51:13.820
How're you feeling?

51:14.821 --> 51:16.114
Are you?

53:36.630 --> 53:38.173
Is your head throbbing right now?

53:39.257 --> 53:40.508
Try to look up.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.569
We're knocking 'em out
left and right.

55:46.134 --> 55:48.136
What's with the push-ups?

57:10.927 --> 57:13.054
Monica's gonna love me
when I hold out three of her girls.

57:14.722 --> 57:17.183
That's the pyramid, right there.
