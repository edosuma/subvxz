- Look at...
- Oh, he's so cute.

00:02.746 --> 00:04.278
Of course he is. He's half Natalie.

00:04.303 --> 00:06.008
- Look.
- Aww!

00:06.033 --> 00:07.286
So precious.

00:07.311 --> 00:08.679
Oh, and would you look at that.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.560
He got my eyelashes.

00:10.585 --> 00:12.643
You delivered him.
That doesn't give him your DNA.

00:12.668 --> 00:14.631
You'd be surprised. The power of these hands.

00:14.656 --> 00:15.877
You can sign out
the patient in four.

00:15.902 --> 00:17.965
- Look... look at Owen.
- Cute.

00:17.990 --> 00:19.414
Have you been up to see
Natalie today?

00:19.439 --> 00:21.806
- Not yet.
- What's up with him?

00:21.808 --> 00:23.174
Thought he wouldn't leave
her bedside.

00:23.176 --> 00:24.975
[phone rings]

00:24.977 --> 00:28.046
- Dr. Zanetti.
- Dr. Rhodes.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.457
How was the conference?

00:29.482 --> 00:30.614
I spent an entire week

00:30.616 --> 00:32.116
listening to people
talk about surgeries.

00:32.118 --> 00:34.454
All I wanted was
to actually do one.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.125
Kept hoping a speaker would
choke on his dentures

00:36.150 --> 00:38.099
- so I could cric him.
- Dinner tonight?

00:38.124 --> 00:39.800
I can't. I'm in-house on call.

00:39.825 --> 00:43.041
Head's up. Incoming traumas.

Multi-victim car crash. Let's go!

00:45.537 --> 00:47.007
Maybe someone'll need surgery.

00:47.032 --> 00:48.539
I'm ready to cut.

00:49.012 --> 00:52.113
- What do we got?
- Female, mid-20s. GCS 3.

00:52.138 --> 00:54.305
Struck the dashboard
and starred the windshield.

00:54.330 --> 00:55.929

- Uh, 90 over 50.

Pressure dressing on her head,
but she's seeping through.

the King with an ET.

Jess, talk to me!

- Where is she?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Does Jess have any family
in the area we should notify?

01:37.915 --> 01:41.118
I think... her mom lives here.
Maybe.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.476
- Any allergies to medications?
- I don't know.

01:43.501 --> 01:45.065
Do you know if she's currently
on any medication?

01:45.090 --> 01:45.964
I don't know.

01:45.989 --> 01:47.720
Is there anything
you can tell us about Jess

01:47.745 --> 01:50.179
that could help us?
No. I'm sorry, I...

01:50.204 --> 01:52.615

- Yes, Doctor.

- Got it.

We need to stop these bleeders.

- Saline?
- Got it. Here's saline.

Okay, she's still got
glass shards in her scalp.

02:53.163 --> 02:55.464
She's not stable enough
to go to CT.

02:55.466 --> 02:56.765
We need to open her up now.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.066
Call the OR and tell them
we're on our way up.

He was driving the car that t-boned

A stolen car.

03:40.121 --> 03:42.054
- This guy's dangerous.
- I'll take my chances.

03:42.079 --> 03:43.945
He served nine years
for armed robbery.

03:43.970 --> 03:45.932
- He's an ex-con.
- He's also my patient.

03:45.957 --> 03:48.001
I can't treat him properly
until the cuffs are off.

03:48.026 --> 03:49.831
All right.

in good hands with Dr. Farinas.

- You okay?
- Yes.

on the shower in Orlando.

- Let me take a look at it.
- No, no, no.

08:32.229 --> 08:33.395
- It's fine.
- No, no.

08:33.421 --> 08:34.654
- It's fine, really.
- Just... hey, hey.

08:34.655 --> 08:36.789
Shush, shush. Just, shh.

08:37.903 --> 08:39.772
<i>[elevator bell dings]</i>

08:39.797 --> 08:41.179
[laughs]

08:41.203 --> 08:43.466
Wait, no. No, no, no.
What are we doing?

08:43.491 --> 08:45.858
You are going to Ortho
to get that checked out.

08:45.883 --> 08:47.438
No, it's not necessary.

08:47.463 --> 08:48.896
Uh, your elbow is red

08:48.921 --> 08:50.495
and it feels hot.
So, yeah, it is.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.853
Yeah, well,
I put myself on Cipro, so...

08:52.878 --> 08:54.377
Oh, so you know
you have an infection?

08:54.402 --> 08:55.827
Just as a precaution.

08:55.852 --> 08:56.817
Well, as a precaution,

08:56.842 --> 08:57.841
you are going to get it
checked out,

08:57.866 --> 08:59.399
because that may need
to be drained.

08:59.424 --> 09:01.758
- [laughing]
- Look, Sam? Sam.

09:01.783 --> 09:03.683
This is serious.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.301
You know better.
Don't mess around.

09:05.326 --> 09:06.925
Okay. All right.

09:06.950 --> 09:08.717
I will get it looked at.

09:08.742 --> 09:11.056
Okay.
That's all I'm asking.

09:11.082 --> 09:12.548
[chuckles]

09:14.587 --> 09:16.120
- Ouch.
- You were right.

09:16.145 --> 09:18.412
Two-bone distal fracture,
moderately displaced.

09:18.437 --> 09:19.536
Needs to be plated.

09:19.561 --> 09:20.927
It didn't take
a diagnostic genius.

09:20.952 --> 09:22.885
Not with that
degree of deformity.

09:23.073 --> 09:24.740
- Mr. Blevins...
- I'm done here.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.067
Let 'em take me away.

09:26.092 --> 09:27.950
Well, I'm afraid, first,
you need surgery

09:27.975 --> 09:29.593
to realign
the bones in your arm.

09:29.660 --> 09:31.467
We're gonna have
an orthopedic surgeon

09:31.492 --> 09:34.293
- come down right now to...
- No. No surgery.

09:34.318 --> 09:35.551
[coughing]

09:35.576 --> 09:37.915
Well, without it, your arm
may not heal properly.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.362
You could have
a permanent deformity

09:39.387 --> 09:40.519
and reduced function.

09:40.521 --> 09:42.660
Put a cast on it.

09:42.685 --> 09:43.984
Mr. Blevins,
you want some water?

09:44.009 --> 09:47.644
No... no, what I want
is to be taken out of here.

09:48.716 --> 09:50.597
Put the cuffs...
[gurgles]

09:50.622 --> 09:51.879
Put the cuffs on!

09:51.904 --> 09:54.231
- Whoa. Mr. Blevins.
- [coughs]

09:54.256 --> 09:55.346
[screams]
Okay.

09:55.371 --> 09:56.823
I need...
[screams]

09:56.848 --> 09:58.147
All right, I need suction.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.722
Get a crash cart
and have atropine ready

09:59.747 --> 10:00.880
in case his heart rate drops.

10:00.905 --> 10:02.938
We are not losing this guy.

10:06.704 --> 10:08.204
Where is he?
Where is Walter?

10:08.229 --> 10:10.302
We are running a few tests
right now.

10:10.327 --> 10:12.360
When he's done,
I can take you to him.

10:12.363 --> 10:15.297
Oh, Dr. Halstead,
this is Mrs. Blevins.

10:15.299 --> 10:17.900
Please, someone tell me
what's going on.

10:17.902 --> 10:19.869
Your husband
was in a car accident.

10:19.871 --> 10:21.670
He has a badly broken arm

10:21.672 --> 10:22.972
and in the last half hour

10:22.974 --> 10:24.540
he began coughing up blood

10:24.542 --> 10:26.842
- and passed out.
- Oh, my God!

10:26.844 --> 10:29.311
Is Walter being treated
for any illnesses?

10:29.313 --> 10:31.881
No.
No, he's... he's fine.

10:31.883 --> 10:34.683
- I need to see him.
- Okay.

10:34.685 --> 10:36.685
I can take you to his room.

10:40.458 --> 10:43.692
Excuse me. Um, Mrs. Blevins?
My name's Jay Halstead.

10:43.694 --> 10:45.594
I'm a detective with
the Chicago Police Department.

10:45.596 --> 10:47.897
I need to ask you a few
questions about your husband.

10:47.899 --> 10:49.532
Why are the police involved?

10:49.534 --> 10:51.300
I thought Walter
was in an accident.

10:51.302 --> 10:52.568
Uh, yes.

10:52.570 --> 10:54.336
He was driving a car
that he stole.

10:54.338 --> 10:56.446
- At gunpoint.
- What?

10:56.471 --> 10:58.505
There's multiple witnesses.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.137
That son of a bitch.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.453
I'm sorry.
Ma'am?

11:03.614 --> 11:05.014
My husband is no angel.

11:05.016 --> 11:06.348
I knew that when I married him,

11:06.350 --> 11:09.919
but he has been straight
for 18 years.

11:09.921 --> 11:11.754
Has a job, a kid,

11:11.756 --> 11:14.056
and now, out of the blue,
he throws it all away?

11:14.058 --> 11:16.125
I warned him, if he ever
committed another crime,

11:16.127 --> 11:17.359
I would leave him,
and that is exactly

11:17.384 --> 11:18.454
what I'm going to do.

11:18.479 --> 11:20.479
What do you want to know?

11:20.504 --> 11:22.471
Um, why don't we go
sit down somewhere?

11:22.496 --> 11:24.496
Yeah.

11:28.472 --> 11:30.406
I'm looking for a Robert Parker.

11:30.408 --> 11:31.807
Bobby's in Treatment 3.

11:31.809 --> 11:33.709
Wha... who called
for a psych consult?

11:33.711 --> 11:35.878
The attending,
Dr. Movitt.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.379
- Why?
- I know Bobby.

11:37.381 --> 11:38.647
Treated him for a month now.

11:38.649 --> 11:39.882
He's just really kind.

11:39.884 --> 11:42.251
Huh.
I guess there's some concern

11:42.253 --> 11:43.719
that he can't
take care of himself?

11:43.721 --> 11:45.154
Because he gave
some clothes away?

11:45.156 --> 11:46.622
He just likes to help people.

11:46.624 --> 11:50.559
Oh,
just gonna have a little chat.

11:51.863 --> 11:53.629
He is such a good nurser.

11:53.631 --> 11:55.641
I think it took Jeff
three or four days

11:55.666 --> 11:58.334
to actually get the hang of it.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.736
- He's so beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

12:00.738 --> 12:02.872
Oh, look at this.

12:02.874 --> 12:04.740
I couldn't resist.

12:04.742 --> 12:07.418
A little something for him
to wear on the way home.

12:07.443 --> 12:08.695
Isn't that cute?

12:08.720 --> 12:12.058
Oh, I think he's finished.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.515
Oh, you think he is?

12:13.517 --> 12:14.950
Here. I'll get him.

12:14.952 --> 12:18.520
You come here.
You come here to me.

12:18.522 --> 12:22.358
- Yeah. Oh.
- [baby coos]

12:22.360 --> 12:25.661
Oh.
[chuckles]

12:25.663 --> 12:27.162
You know, my parents emailed.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.430
They should be here soon.

12:28.432 --> 12:29.798
Oh.

12:29.823 --> 12:32.940
Well, they'll be so happy
to see the baby.

12:32.965 --> 12:34.882
They must miss you terribly.

12:34.906 --> 12:38.173
Yeah, they complain
about it all the time.

12:38.175 --> 12:42.544
Always asking when I'm gonna
move back to Seattle.

12:42.546 --> 12:46.015
- Do you ever think about that?
- Oh, yeah,

12:46.017 --> 12:47.616
but I want to finish
my fellowship.

12:47.618 --> 12:51.086
Oh.
Well, you met Jeff here.

12:51.088 --> 12:53.022
You must have a lot
of good memories here.

12:53.024 --> 12:54.623
Of course I do.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.525
I mean, I know the weather's
not good in Chicago,

12:56.527 --> 13:00.462
but Seattle, ugh.
That rain?

13:00.464 --> 13:03.365
I'd get depressed.

13:05.102 --> 13:06.402
What do you think?

13:06.404 --> 13:08.437
So, uh, how long you been
living at the shelter, Bobby?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.406
Uh, about two months now.

13:10.408 --> 13:12.074
And where were you before that?

13:12.076 --> 13:13.842
At home.
Uh, Lincoln Park.

13:13.844 --> 13:15.177
Ooh, nice neighborhood.

13:15.179 --> 13:17.046
Shelter must have been
quite a change.

13:17.048 --> 13:18.547
I don't mind.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.482
The people there need me.

13:20.484 --> 13:21.684
I don't have much anymore,

13:21.686 --> 13:23.953
but what I do have,
I'm happy to give.

13:23.955 --> 13:25.955
And what prompted you
to make the move

13:25.957 --> 13:27.589
from Lincoln Park?

13:27.591 --> 13:29.358
It's my wife's idea.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.293
She said I was giving away
all of our savings.

13:31.295 --> 13:33.195
Bankrupting the family.

13:33.197 --> 13:35.364
She didn't know
what happened to me.

13:35.366 --> 13:36.832
Why I changed.

13:36.834 --> 13:38.834
Uh, tell me how you changed.

13:38.836 --> 13:41.770
[chuckles]
I used to be a regular guy.

13:41.772 --> 13:44.345
Corporate job, a house,
a couple of cars.

13:44.370 --> 13:47.176
One morning I woke up,

13:47.178 --> 13:49.845
and I realized that
the only thing I wanted to do,

13:49.847 --> 13:52.247
the only thing that mattered,

13:52.249 --> 13:54.116
was helping other people.

13:54.118 --> 13:55.918
Giving whatever I had to them.

13:55.920 --> 13:59.788
Any idea of the, uh...
The source of this inspiration?

13:59.790 --> 14:02.925
You mean did God talk to me?
Or an angel?

14:02.927 --> 14:06.495
No, no, I...
I just knew...

14:06.497 --> 14:08.497
inside.

14:09.767 --> 14:11.867
I can barely see it.

14:11.869 --> 14:13.602
It's the gray spot right here.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.037
That's the hematoma.

14:15.039 --> 14:16.538
We often see it in car crashes.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.940
When the seatbelt you were
wearing tightened,

14:17.942 --> 14:19.942
it caused a deep bruise
around your intestine.

14:19.944 --> 14:22.729
So I'm, like, bleeding inside?

14:22.754 --> 14:24.179
Not anymore.

14:24.181 --> 14:26.081
Blood's clotted now,
formed a solid mass,

14:26.083 --> 14:28.283
causing the swelling and pain
you're feeling in your stomach.

14:28.285 --> 14:29.944
The swelling should go down
in a couple days.

14:29.969 --> 14:31.587
For the next few hours,
we'll continue to monitor you.

14:31.589 --> 14:33.122
So sit tight, all right?

14:33.124 --> 14:35.157
What about Jess?

14:35.159 --> 14:37.659
She's still in ICU.

14:39.597 --> 14:42.031
We met at this coffee shop,

14:42.033 --> 14:43.699
but it was too crowded,

14:43.701 --> 14:47.002
so I suggested we drive
to one a few miles away.

14:48.172 --> 14:50.172
That's when it happened.

14:52.043 --> 14:54.443
Can I see her?

14:54.445 --> 14:56.311
I'll have a nurse
take you up to ICU

14:56.313 --> 14:58.847
once Jess has been cleared
for visitors.

14:58.849 --> 15:01.784
- Thanks.
- Sure.

15:05.156 --> 15:07.122
And initial there, please.

15:07.124 --> 15:08.991
And sign here
to acknowledge receipt.

15:08.993 --> 15:10.628
That's two bags HLA-matched

15:10.653 --> 15:12.185
bone marrow-regenerating stem cells

15:12.210 --> 15:14.678
- for patient Christy Pierce.
- Thank you.

15:14.703 --> 15:16.703
Careful with these.

15:17.859 --> 15:19.158
Thanks.

15:19.183 --> 15:22.050
Fingers crossed.

15:22.075 --> 15:23.642
Sharon.

15:25.896 --> 15:28.030
I'm sorry to have to tell you
this, believe me.

15:28.055 --> 15:29.321
Tell me what?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.113
The hospital's decided
to shut down

15:31.115 --> 15:32.848
Christy Pierce's transplant.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.982
What?

15:33.984 --> 15:35.684
Have you seen these?

15:35.686 --> 15:37.539
Yeah, Christy's brother
put them up.

15:37.564 --> 15:39.007
He organized a fundraiser.

15:39.032 --> 15:40.622
For Christy's donor.

15:40.624 --> 15:42.825
And the hospital is concerned
about the appearance

15:42.827 --> 15:44.760
of an individual being
compensated

15:44.762 --> 15:46.285
for donating an organ, which...

15:46.310 --> 15:48.297
Violates federal law.
I know that,

15:48.299 --> 15:50.132
but no one's being paid.

15:50.134 --> 15:51.767
The donor agreed months ago.

15:51.769 --> 15:53.702
Well, it still puts
the hospital and its staff

15:53.704 --> 15:55.704
at risk for hefty fines,

15:55.706 --> 15:57.239
sanctions,
I mean, even imprisonment.

15:57.241 --> 16:00.242
It's a kid doing a good deed.

16:00.244 --> 16:02.038
- He's a minor.
- It doesn't matter.

16:02.063 --> 16:03.812
These flyers have put us
in an impossible situation.

16:03.814 --> 16:05.829
Well how about Christy's
impossible situation?

16:05.854 --> 16:08.755
- Maggie.
- It...

16:09.732 --> 16:11.232
Christy has just gone through

16:11.257 --> 16:14.758
five days of chemotherapy
and radiation.

16:14.802 --> 16:17.136
Her body has been ravaged

16:17.161 --> 16:19.428
in preparation
for this transplant.

16:19.430 --> 16:22.620
Without it, she will die.

16:23.077 --> 16:25.044
- It's out of my hands.
- No, Peter,

16:25.069 --> 16:26.916
it's still in your hands.

16:26.941 --> 16:28.808
Find a way to fix this.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.866
I will do my best,
but the law does not give me

16:30.891 --> 16:33.258
a lot of room to maneuver
on this.

16:33.283 --> 16:36.318
You need to look
for another donor.

16:38.315 --> 16:40.349
[sighs]

16:44.492 --> 16:45.959
I don't understand.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.120
They can't just
shut the transplant down.

16:48.145 --> 16:49.193
They can't do that.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.115
I'm sorry, Kathleen.
They can and they have.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.516
No, there must be
something you can do.

16:54.541 --> 16:56.946
We're exploring
our legal options,

16:56.971 --> 16:58.771
but the only thing
we can do right now

16:58.796 --> 17:00.622
is look for another donor

17:00.647 --> 17:02.013
which we're doing.

17:02.015 --> 17:03.780
Wha... what if we promise

17:03.805 --> 17:05.493
not to give any of the proceeds
to the donor?

17:05.519 --> 17:09.487
Unfortunately, the intent
was to give a financial gift

17:09.512 --> 17:12.500
to the donor, which is enough

17:12.525 --> 17:13.894
in the eyes of the law.

17:13.919 --> 17:16.151
Intent?

17:16.175 --> 17:18.006
Are these lawyers
gonna go in there

17:18.008 --> 17:20.642
and tell my daughter that intent

17:20.666 --> 17:22.503
is more important than she is?

17:22.529 --> 17:24.714
Are they willing to let her die?

17:24.739 --> 17:26.571
Do you want me
to break the news to Christy?

17:26.597 --> 17:28.463
No.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.887
I'm her mother.

17:32.912 --> 17:35.713
I'll tell her.

17:44.707 --> 17:47.974
Mr. Blevins,
how are you feeling?

17:48.104 --> 17:49.704
I hope that means better.

17:49.729 --> 17:52.430
Has anything like that
ever happened before?

17:52.432 --> 17:54.098
How's the couple I hit?

17:54.100 --> 17:56.467
She's in the ICU.
We're monitoring him.

17:56.469 --> 17:58.436
Can they take me away now?

17:58.438 --> 17:59.768
First, we need to discuss

17:59.793 --> 18:01.259
the results of your chest X-ray.

18:01.284 --> 18:02.450
[sighs]

18:02.475 --> 18:04.121
We discovered a mass,

18:04.146 --> 18:06.246
approximately two centimeters
in diameter,

18:06.279 --> 18:08.212
in the left lobe of your lungs.

18:08.214 --> 18:09.647
Now, a finding like that,

18:09.649 --> 18:11.449
in conjunction with
coughing blood...

18:11.451 --> 18:14.185
I'm concerned.

18:14.187 --> 18:16.153
We need a CT scan, and then
a possible biopsy...

18:16.155 --> 18:18.022
Don't bother.

18:18.024 --> 18:19.357
Well, we really should
determine...

18:19.359 --> 18:21.926
It's cancer.

18:23.410 --> 18:26.111
I've known about it
for a few months.

18:27.700 --> 18:29.300
When I spoke with
your wife earlier,

18:29.302 --> 18:31.402
she didn't mention
that you were diagnosed.

18:31.404 --> 18:34.071
She doesn't know about it.

18:35.575 --> 18:37.100
Well, have you started
treatment, or...

18:37.125 --> 18:38.509
Look, you've run
your little test.

18:38.511 --> 18:40.478
You've checked all the boxes,
but now,

18:40.480 --> 18:42.747
I just want the cops
to get me out of here.

18:42.749 --> 18:44.561
Well, I can't release
you until I'm sure

18:44.586 --> 18:47.476
you're stable enough for jail.

18:47.501 --> 18:50.102
Well, do what you have to.

18:51.868 --> 18:53.635
All right.

18:53.660 --> 18:57.295
Don't tell my wife about this.

19:01.988 --> 19:03.855
[sighs]

19:03.880 --> 19:06.814
<i>[monitors beeping]</i>

19:16.678 --> 19:19.846
[whispers] Jess.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.881
Mike.

19:28.520 --> 19:32.388
I wanted to see how you were.

19:38.471 --> 19:41.848
How are you feeling?

19:46.690 --> 19:49.023
Oh, he smells like heaven.

19:49.048 --> 19:50.548
Think he knows me?

19:50.550 --> 19:51.849
Of course he does.

19:51.851 --> 19:52.777
<i>[door opening]</i>

19:52.802 --> 19:54.149
- Hello!
- [gasps]

19:54.174 --> 19:55.907
Mom!

19:55.932 --> 19:57.632
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Daddy.

19:57.657 --> 20:00.417
Helen.
Hello, Helen. Congratulations.

20:00.442 --> 20:03.304
[gasp]
Oh, let me hold him.

20:03.329 --> 20:05.096
Well, he... he's asleep.

20:05.098 --> 20:06.931
Oh, yes, he is.
Yes, he is.

20:06.933 --> 20:09.468
Oh, yes you are.
Yes, you are.

20:09.493 --> 20:12.146
Look at this beautiful boy.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.505
Can you believe
we're grandparents?

20:14.507 --> 20:17.475
Oh, I think he has
your daddy's mouth.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.876
- You think?
- Watch his head.

20:18.878 --> 20:21.045
- Oh, here. Here he is.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.566
Oh.

20:22.591 --> 20:25.526
Oh, wait till
Auntie and Uncle Cliff meet him.

20:25.752 --> 20:26.851
We're putting a crib
in your room

20:26.853 --> 20:28.819
for when you and Owen
come to visit.

20:28.821 --> 20:30.888
Just don't take down
my Nick Carter poster, okay?

20:30.890 --> 20:33.867
- We won't. We promise.
- Good. Right.

20:33.892 --> 20:35.772
Dr. Charles.

20:35.797 --> 20:37.930
I heard Bobby was upstairs
getting a CT?

20:37.955 --> 20:39.655
Yeah, just want to rule out

20:39.680 --> 20:42.681
any organic cause
for his behavior, that's all.

20:42.706 --> 20:43.888
You think he's crazy?

20:43.888 --> 20:45.488
You mean like delusional
or psychotic?

20:45.490 --> 20:46.509
Not at all.

20:46.534 --> 20:48.301
Quite rational, in fact.

20:48.326 --> 20:50.159
Then why the CT?

20:50.161 --> 20:53.496
Actions are a little
obsessive, if not compulsive.

20:53.498 --> 20:54.797
You know, giving your shoes away

20:54.799 --> 20:57.199
in Chicago
in the middle of the winter?

20:57.201 --> 20:58.868
You've, um...

20:58.870 --> 21:01.837
taken quite an interest
in Mr. Parker, haven't you?

21:01.839 --> 21:03.139
Yeah, I guess I have.

21:03.141 --> 21:06.108
It's...
never mind.

21:07.759 --> 21:09.725
Try me.

21:11.783 --> 21:13.649
St. Francis.

21:13.651 --> 21:15.718
He reminds me of St. Francis.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.120
- I was raised Catholic.
- Ah.

21:18.122 --> 21:19.755
And growing up, we had
this little statue

21:19.757 --> 21:21.624
of San Francisco in the garden.

21:21.626 --> 21:23.392
Of all the saints,
he was my favorite.

21:23.394 --> 21:24.945
He gave away all his money,

21:24.970 --> 21:26.596
all his possessions,
to the poor.

21:26.598 --> 21:29.298
Took care of the sick
with no thought of himself.

21:29.300 --> 21:30.933
Remarkable fella.

21:30.935 --> 21:33.402
I'm not saying Bobby
is an actual saint,

21:33.404 --> 21:36.138
but... saintly?

21:36.140 --> 21:38.274
Yeah.

21:38.276 --> 21:39.842
We're just...
Want to make sure

21:39.844 --> 21:42.044
we're doing the right thing
by him, that's all.

21:42.046 --> 21:44.580
Yeah.

21:47.619 --> 21:49.051
- Boss?
- Yeah?

21:49.053 --> 21:51.020
Peter Kalmick's in Treatment 4.

21:51.022 --> 21:53.589
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

21:55.660 --> 21:57.326
What happened?

21:57.328 --> 21:59.095
I've been getting
these pounding headaches.

21:59.097 --> 22:01.230
His blood pressure spiked.

22:01.232 --> 22:03.065
Dr. Movitt put him
on a nipride drip.

22:03.067 --> 22:06.068
- Pressure's coming down.
- Thank you.

22:11.342 --> 22:12.742
Christy Pierce,

22:12.744 --> 22:14.377
there's nothing I can do.

22:14.379 --> 22:17.747
You understand why the sale
of human organs is illegal.

22:17.749 --> 22:19.208
Once they have monetary value,

22:19.233 --> 22:20.583
at best,
poor people will sell them.

22:20.585 --> 22:22.029
At worst, people will get
killed for them.

22:22.054 --> 22:23.353
I get all that.

22:23.421 --> 22:24.854
How about you try this?

22:24.856 --> 22:26.653
Bone marrow is not an organ.

22:26.678 --> 22:29.068
According to the National
Organ Transplant Act, it is.

22:29.093 --> 22:30.526
But that's wrong.

22:30.528 --> 22:34.050
A donor's marrow regenerates
itself within two weeks.

22:34.075 --> 22:35.608
It's just like giving blood.

22:35.633 --> 22:37.266
Come on, Sharon.
I've done my homework.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.568
In 2011, the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals

22:39.570 --> 22:42.104
ruled that bone marrow donors
can be compensated

22:42.106 --> 22:44.530
because the cells are
blood parts, not organ parts.

22:44.555 --> 22:45.675
So what's the problem?

22:45.677 --> 22:47.209
The problem is that that's
the Ninth Circuit.

22:47.211 --> 22:50.212
It's Arizona, Montana.
We're in Illinois, the Seventh.

22:50.214 --> 22:51.981
It hasn't ruled.

22:51.983 --> 22:53.716
Look...
[sighs]

22:53.718 --> 22:56.052
I shouldn't just gone into
estate planning like my brother.

22:56.054 --> 22:57.887
It's so much less stressful.

22:57.889 --> 23:00.256
I'm sorry you're suffering,
Peter,

23:00.258 --> 23:02.792
but your stress is nothing

23:02.817 --> 23:06.385
compared to
what's going on upstairs.

23:09.100 --> 23:12.168
- <i>[alarm blares]
- Help!</i>

23:12.170 --> 23:14.670
- That's Jess's room.
- She must have thrown a clot.

23:14.672 --> 23:16.038
Help him, please. Somebody!

23:16.040 --> 23:17.640
He was complaining of
abdominal pain.

23:17.674 --> 23:19.073
- CT showed a duodenal hematoma.
- Oh, Mike!

23:19.098 --> 23:20.877
- Mike...
- Ah!

23:20.902 --> 23:22.168
It must've ruptured.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.559
We need to get him
up to the OR, now.

23:23.584 --> 23:25.284
- Yes, Doctor.
- Is he gonna be all right?

23:25.309 --> 23:28.143
We'll do our best.

23:28.152 --> 23:29.685
[grunts]

23:35.116 --> 23:37.016
There's too much blood.
More suction.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.541
Suction.

23:40.801 --> 23:42.734
There's food particles
mixed in with his blood.

23:42.759 --> 23:44.492
Slow down,
it won't do you any good

23:44.494 --> 23:45.960
if you make the injury bigger.

23:45.962 --> 23:48.029
If he bleeds out,
it won't help me, either.

23:48.031 --> 23:50.398
It's a big duodenal hematoma

23:50.400 --> 23:52.567
with pretty brisk bleeding
along the anterior perforation.

23:52.592 --> 23:53.248
Stitch?

23:53.273 --> 23:55.264
The lac extends
into the second portion.

23:55.289 --> 23:59.124
- I can see that.
- Stay clear of the ampulla.

23:59.149 --> 24:01.953
What did the Ortho say
about the elbow?

24:01.978 --> 24:04.479
Just concentrate
on your surgery.

24:04.481 --> 24:05.506
Did he drain it?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.245
Make sure you close
transversely.

24:07.270 --> 24:08.303
- I got it.
- In two layers.

24:08.328 --> 24:09.378
I know what I'm doing.

24:09.403 --> 24:10.936
Don't take that tone with me,
Dr. Rhodes.

24:10.961 --> 24:13.521
I'm your attending.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.549
Right.

24:18.297 --> 24:20.197
Close him up.

24:20.222 --> 24:23.523
Unless Dr. Zanetti
would prefer to.

24:29.803 --> 24:31.803
Helen?

24:34.223 --> 24:36.390
Maggie.

24:36.623 --> 24:39.257
Why are you out here
and not with Natalie?

24:39.282 --> 24:41.416
Oh, um,

24:41.418 --> 24:43.951
her... her parents
flew in from Seattle,

24:43.953 --> 24:47.822
so...
they're in there with her.

24:47.824 --> 24:49.891
Okay.

24:49.893 --> 24:52.794
- [sobs]
- Oh.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.847
[whimpers]

25:04.311 --> 25:07.579
Je... Jeff was my...
My only child,

25:07.604 --> 25:09.570
and...

25:09.595 --> 25:12.797
and his dad and I divorced
when he was three.

25:12.816 --> 25:15.416
He's remarried and...

25:15.441 --> 25:18.809
lives in Arizona someplace.

25:20.095 --> 25:22.729
The rest of my family is...

25:22.754 --> 25:24.387
gone.

25:24.412 --> 25:27.579
Jeff is gone...

25:27.604 --> 25:30.672
and Natalie and Owen...
[sobs]

25:30.700 --> 25:34.979
They're...
They're all I have.

25:35.004 --> 25:37.905
- They're all...
- Oh, honey.

25:37.907 --> 25:40.975
I don't want Natalie
and the baby go to Seattle.

25:40.977 --> 25:44.245
I'm selfish too.
I don't want Natalie to go.

25:44.270 --> 25:45.436
[sobbing]

25:47.917 --> 25:49.487
Hey there, Bobby.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.786
- Hey.
- Got your CT results back.

25:51.788 --> 25:54.255
I'd like to go over them
with you if you have a sec.

25:54.257 --> 25:55.890
- I can finish this later.
- No, no. Stay.

25:55.892 --> 25:57.358
It's... it's fine.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.193
So...

25:59.195 --> 26:01.395
when we talked before

26:01.397 --> 26:02.866
about the change you
experienced,

26:02.891 --> 26:04.657
you said that it was sudden.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.367
- Happened overnight.
- That's right.

26:06.369 --> 26:07.602
The abrupt nature of the change

26:07.604 --> 26:10.538
made me wonder if there might
be a physical cause.

26:10.540 --> 26:13.841
So here, I want you to take
a look at something.

26:13.843 --> 26:16.177
This...

26:16.179 --> 26:18.145
is an image of a typical brain.

26:18.147 --> 26:20.948
And this...
is yours.

26:20.950 --> 26:22.683
Why does it look different?

26:22.685 --> 26:27.121
Because you, my friend,
had a stroke.

26:28.229 --> 26:30.596
That's...
I know stroke victims.

26:30.621 --> 26:32.206
They're... they're crippled
or can't speak.

26:32.231 --> 26:34.506
There are actually many
different kinds of strokes.

26:34.531 --> 26:37.331
Yours caused lesions to form
in the frontal lobe.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.933
That's the region of the brain
that controls,

26:38.935 --> 26:41.802
among many other things,
behavior and judgment.

26:41.804 --> 26:43.604
So you're saying
I'm brain damaged?

26:43.606 --> 26:45.439
I'm saying that,
in your instance,

26:45.441 --> 26:47.308
the stroke didn't cause
any physical impairment,

26:47.310 --> 26:48.776
but it did cause you to become

26:48.778 --> 26:50.822
what, clinically,

26:50.847 --> 26:54.449
I would describe as
pathologically generous.

26:54.474 --> 26:57.608
Making you compulsively
driven to give.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.821
So I help people
because of damage to my brain?

27:00.823 --> 27:01.989
Basically, yeah.

27:01.991 --> 27:04.358
But it feels good.
It makes me happy.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.727
Makes sense.

27:06.729 --> 27:08.529
I... I...

27:08.531 --> 27:09.797
don't want you to fix it.

27:09.799 --> 27:12.203
Well, that's fortunate because,

27:12.228 --> 27:13.260
truthfully, even if you did,

27:13.285 --> 27:15.785
aside from some
behavioral therapy,

27:15.810 --> 27:18.578
- we can't.
- Okay.

27:18.608 --> 27:21.042
Okay.

27:21.044 --> 27:22.577
I got back in touch

to protect his family.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.055
Sure. Sure.

37:22.057 --> 37:23.557
Here's a stat for you.

37:23.559 --> 37:25.392
Health care expenses

of all bankruptcies

free health care, Jay.

Gandhi, Saint Francis...

I'm supposed to tell you that
