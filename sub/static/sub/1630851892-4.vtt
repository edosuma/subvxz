01:00.018 --> 01:01.519
<i>This is crazy.</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:04.564
<i>But it was so good.</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:09.069
I want to keep sleeping like this.

01:09.652 --> 01:10.695
Me too.

01:12.530 --> 01:14.074
Should we skip school?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.538
<i>At least if I was drunk,
I could have used that as an excuse.</i>

02:06.668 --> 02:11.339
EPISODE 4: I KNOW IT ISN'T LOVE.
NEVERTHELESS,

02:18.763 --> 02:21.224
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.601
Where's the hair dryer?

02:24.185 --> 02:26.479
-Darn it.
-Let's talk.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.483
Hey, put your clothes on!

02:34.195 --> 02:36.739
I must have alcohol-related dementia.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.742
I don't remember what happened yesterday.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.412
-So--
-It was a mistake?

02:42.495 --> 02:43.621
What?

02:47.834 --> 02:51.296
Yes. Honestly, we both
made a mistake while drunk, right?

02:52.422 --> 02:55.216
So there's nothing to change between us.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.135
Don't you think?

02:57.635 --> 02:58.720
I'm leaving.

02:59.304 --> 03:02.515
Hey! Wait!

03:07.228 --> 03:10.148
Darn it! I must have lost my mind!

03:10.899 --> 03:13.192
Why did it have to be him?

03:23.202 --> 03:24.454
Is that mine?

03:25.246 --> 03:28.041
Yes. I washed it.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.085
It's fine, you can have it.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.838
Or just throw it away.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.342
Right.
I'm going to have breakfast outside.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.177
Outside?

03:39.260 --> 03:40.470
By myself.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.849
Oh, right. I get it.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.560
I should get some more sleep.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.479
Go ahead.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.777
I want to keep seeing you.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.696
What about you?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.907
<i>This is it.</i>

04:00.990 --> 04:02.283
What do you mean?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.660
Should we meet up sometimes?

04:04.244 --> 04:07.247
<i>So he's asking if I want to meet up</i>

04:07.872 --> 04:10.917
<i>and sleep with him sometimes</i>

04:11.000 --> 04:12.669
<i>without dating?</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:14.963
I'm not sure.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.507
Think about it and tell me.

04:18.216 --> 04:22.178
I'll be off. Go to the hospital
if you're not feeling well. Okay?

04:23.054 --> 04:24.264
Okay.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.290
Park Jae-eon?

05:06.723 --> 05:09.684
-It wasn't a mistake for me.
-What?

05:09.767 --> 05:12.937
And things won't be the same
for me, either.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.773
So I don't think I can pretend
it didn't happen.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.072
What if you don't?

05:23.156 --> 05:27.035
I don't think I can stay friends
with you now.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.494
Then what?

05:30.538 --> 05:32.915
-You don't mean…
-Be my girlfriend.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.300
Hey! You…

05:44.260 --> 05:48.681
You want to date because we slept
together once? You're overreacting.

05:48.765 --> 05:49.974
Do you like me?

05:53.644 --> 05:56.189
See? You can't answer that.

05:56.272 --> 05:59.692
Plus, I really don't want to date
within such a small department.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.235
Rumors will spread so quickly.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.987
It's going to be really irritating.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.701
All right.

06:09.827 --> 06:13.164
I understand how you feel,
so I'll take care of my own feelings.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.085
What do you mean? Hey!

06:21.506 --> 06:24.383
The guy Sol brought over last night.
Was he her boyfriend?

06:25.468 --> 06:26.552
I don't know.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.514
Jeez!

06:30.014 --> 06:32.225
You're the only one who'd know!

06:32.308 --> 06:34.477
Who is he? Is it…

06:37.480 --> 06:39.065
Is it serious?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.984
Ask her yourself.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.946
I don't care who she dates.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.405
This is so annoying.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.991
What? Did you two fight?

06:51.160 --> 06:54.497
Right. You didn't know about
Sol leaving as an exchange student too.

06:54.997 --> 06:58.084
We didn't fight. That's just
the extent of our relationship.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.128
I'm going.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.268
Seo Ji-wan.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.813
Ji-wan. Ji-wan!

07:19.689 --> 07:21.107
Let me talk to you.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.487
Fine. Talk.
What do you want to talk about first?

07:26.571 --> 07:29.365
Going abroad? Or your boyfriend?

07:30.116 --> 07:31.659
Everyone knew except me.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.369
I was going to tell you.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.872
Right. When were you going to tell me?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.624
The day before you left?
The day before you got married?

07:38.708 --> 07:41.502
What's with you?
You said you don't care who I date.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.087
Right. I don't.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.756
I'm just angry because
you're leaving me out like this.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.759
-When did I leave you out--
-You've always done this.

07:48.843 --> 07:52.597
You never tell me important things
about yourself. You know that?

07:54.932 --> 07:56.058
Like what?

08:09.614 --> 08:13.159
I guess this really is the extent
of our relationship.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.435
Thanks.

08:41.312 --> 08:42.647
What's your next class?

08:43.564 --> 08:46.234
Human Anatomy. It's so hard.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.903
I got an A in that class.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.321
-Really?
-Yes.

08:50.404 --> 08:53.282
-Then help me study.
-What will you do for me, then?

08:58.037 --> 08:59.455
What should I do for you?

09:01.791 --> 09:02.959
Jeez…

09:06.963 --> 09:09.924
By the way…

09:11.884 --> 09:13.010
Well…

09:14.136 --> 09:18.349
I don't want anyone to know about us.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.520
All right.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.189
-Okay.
-Okay.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.317
And…

09:29.151 --> 09:30.528
Well…

09:31.112 --> 09:32.446
You don't…

09:34.282 --> 09:38.494
have any diseases or anything, do you?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.790
Do you?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.212
Don't laugh! I'm serious.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.507
I don't, so don't worry.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.136
Okay.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.264
Do you have time later?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.893
Yes, I have some time.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.396
No, should we meet on Saturday?

10:06.897 --> 10:08.691
You need to rest the next day, right?

10:10.359 --> 10:13.779
No. It's totally fine.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.317
<i>Why did I do that? I acted so impulsively.</i>

10:52.985 --> 10:54.487
I must've lost my mind.

11:00.117 --> 11:02.244
I should just tell him not to come.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.679
-Come in.
-Hey.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.604
What's with the alcohol?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.941
It'll be nice to drink together.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.317
It'll be fun.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.737
Oh, I drank some already.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.490
<i>I couldn't do this sober.</i>

11:41.158 --> 11:42.827
This is cheating.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.286
What do you mean?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.040
We didn't decide on anything.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.210
Decide what?

11:51.293 --> 11:54.755
Weren't we going to study
Human Anatomy together?

11:56.340 --> 11:57.925
Oh, right.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.845
Right. Human Anatomy.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.015
Yes. We should study.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.022
Stop laughing.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.317
I have a gift for you.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.330
<i>Jae-eon is too smooth with everything.</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:32.626
<i>It's like everything
comes naturally to him.</i>

12:33.210 --> 12:34.712
All done.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.800
Do you like it?

12:41.385 --> 12:42.511
Yes.

12:44.763 --> 12:45.973
It's pretty.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.227
It'll be prettier
with the sunlight in the morning.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.534
<i>Like this was always
going to happen between us.</i>

13:10.873 --> 13:12.458
You got me again.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.757
Hang on.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.555
PARK JAE-EON

13:29.183 --> 13:30.559
You saved my number.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.859
<i>I can stop this right now.</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:44.657
<i>Because there are so many reasons
why I shouldn't do this.</i>

13:49.328 --> 13:50.621
<i>But…</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:16.230
You know, you have a mole here.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.107
Where?

14:19.108 --> 14:20.109
Here.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.155
I didn't know.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.997
You look even more pretty today.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.875
<i>I'm still attracted to him,
even at this moment.</i>

14:37.918 --> 14:39.420
<i>Like crazy.</i>

15:00.733 --> 15:02.610
<i>That one simple reason</i>

15:04.028 --> 15:06.488
<i>buries all my concerns again.</i>

15:12.119 --> 15:15.706
Didn't it hurt when you got that tattoo
behind your neck?

15:18.792 --> 15:20.419
Of course, it hurt.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.213
I almost died.

15:25.174 --> 15:26.842
I thought of quitting in the middle.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.057
I'm going to get another one soon.

15:34.224 --> 15:35.351
Where?

15:39.688 --> 15:41.065
Around here.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.444
Another butterfly?

15:45.527 --> 15:46.570
Yes.

15:48.238 --> 15:51.909
A butterfly with lots of black spots
on its wings.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.369
The name's pretty difficult.

15:54.078 --> 15:57.623
Taiwanese black-star hairstreak butterfly.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.168
Taiwan…

16:02.378 --> 16:03.837
That's a really long name.

16:07.675 --> 16:10.010
They eat flowers instead of leaves

16:10.094 --> 16:12.638
when they're caterpillars.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.057
It's unique, right?

16:16.934 --> 16:17.935
Yes.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.314
<i>Since that day, a lot of things
have changed between us.</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:26.360
<i>And Jae-eon slowly seeped into my life.</i>

16:31.740 --> 16:33.117
Get washed.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.877
I'm starting work
at the department office.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.880
You decided to do that? Aren't you busy?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.925
I won't work that long. Just for a while.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.513
It's because of you.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.934
Why?

17:00.894 --> 17:02.229
Come visit often.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.399
-Why would I?
-What?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.569
Come visit me.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.031
All right?

17:12.114 --> 17:13.240
Why would I?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.994
Okay, I will.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.879
Jae-eon, where's that suncatcher
you made last time?

17:26.962 --> 17:28.380
The butterfly-shaped one.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.049
Oh, that?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.509
I gifted it to someone.

17:32.593 --> 17:36.055
That's too bad. I wanted to see it
when it was finished.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.058
-Can you tell us how to make it?
-Tell us!

17:39.141 --> 17:41.393
Learn that from
the Ceramics and Glass students.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.437
Jae-eon is mine now.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.607
What are you talking about?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.692
Darn it! You're so noisy.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.738
If you're done, please just leave.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.075
-Guys, get out.
-Okay.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.160
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:01.205 --> 18:04.333
I heard he doesn't date,
but I guess he has a girlfriend.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.710
I wonder who it is.
She must be really pretty.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.896
-It's raining a lot.
-It is.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.741
-Don't do it.
-I have to do this!

18:37.825 --> 18:40.077
Stop working. Let's just sleep.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.954
-Already?
-Yes.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.916
-Already?
-Yes. I'm sleepy.

18:54.424 --> 18:58.679
<i>Our relationship only exists
at night, but…</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:01.932
Are you washing the dishes?

19:02.015 --> 19:05.185
Yes. It seems like you don't do the dishes
when I'm coming.

19:06.019 --> 19:07.020
You caught me.

19:07.688 --> 19:09.898
I think you're pretty good at housework.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.484
Will you do the laundry too?

19:13.277 --> 19:15.237
-Should I?
-Yes.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.408
-Then let's do it together.
-No. I don't want to do it.

19:19.491 --> 19:23.078
<i>It sometimes felt like we were lovers.</i>

19:23.787 --> 19:25.372
What's your goal today?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.502
Really? Can you do it?

19:32.588 --> 19:34.047
Don't strain yourself.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.054
What was that?

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
My tongue gets numb when I eat this.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.604
So I kissed you first.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.773
<i>Jae-eon is still a mystery to me.</i>

19:51.857 --> 19:53.233
What are you on about?

19:53.317 --> 19:54.526
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.362
Here.

20:01.658 --> 20:05.329
You said your tongue gets numb.
This is good, though.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.955
-Really?
-Yes.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.254
Just eat.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.678
-It's good, right?
-Yes. It's tastier today.

20:43.825 --> 20:47.079
<i>I can't tell if he's warm or cold,</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:50.499
<i>serious or joking.</i>

21:05.305 --> 21:07.099
Are you done with assignments?

21:07.724 --> 21:08.934
No.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.687
Go sleep at your house.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.817
I can't just leave.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.333
<i>My anxiety about Jae-eon
hasn't disappeared, but…</i>

21:44.469 --> 21:46.555
<i>We're much more compatible than I thought.</i>

21:52.561 --> 21:54.604
So the transverse arch

21:54.688 --> 21:56.690
can be seen the best from the front.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.901
I see. You're right.

22:00.777 --> 22:03.488
This is the transverse arch?

22:04.072 --> 22:05.032
Yes.

22:05.782 --> 22:08.452
And this is the medial longitudinal arch.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.331
-Yes.
-This is the lateral longitudinal arch.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.291
Correct.

22:16.877 --> 22:19.379
-What about this?
-Stop. It tickles.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.672
Stop.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.674
I'm studying right now.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.093
What about this?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.137
Hey, it tickles.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.772
<i>And I enjoy</i>

22:37.773 --> 22:39.232
<i>spending nights with him.</i>

22:48.158 --> 22:49.451
Thank you.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.872
-It looks delicious.
-I want corn.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.290
I thought you were on a diet.

22:55.373 --> 22:58.627
-That's why I'm only eating the shrimp.
-Oh, is that right?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.424
Are you dating someone these days?

23:05.008 --> 23:06.051
Me?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.263
No. Why?

23:10.347 --> 23:14.142
You just seem to be in a good mood
these days.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.812
Your face seems to be glowing a bit.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.273
I've been sleeping well.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.280
I mean, I've been getting lots of sleep.

23:28.990 --> 23:32.119
Right. Sleeping is the best way
to improve the condition of your skin.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.289
Oh, right!
Gyu-hyun, would you like a blind date?

23:39.209 --> 23:41.878
A blind date? With who?

23:41.962 --> 23:43.296
My high school friend.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.049
She saw a photo of you on social media,
and she wants to meet you.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.427
She hasn't been dating for a while,
so she's always saying she's lonely.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.929
Tell your friend

23:51.012 --> 23:53.807
that seeing any guy just because
she's lonely won't end well.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.977
Lonely people will be lonely
even if they date someone.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.395
And I think

23:58.478 --> 24:01.273
that if you're in a relationship,

24:01.356 --> 24:05.360
you have a kind of duty
not to make the other feel lonely.

24:05.443 --> 24:07.070
You're right about that.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.280
<i>Today?</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:10.073
Let me see her photo.

24:10.657 --> 24:11.867
All right.

24:11.950 --> 24:12.868
Let me see.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.662
-She's pretty.
-Do you like her?

24:15.745 --> 24:16.997
Introduce me to her.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.499
Should I give you her number, then?

24:20.041 --> 24:21.209
She likes you.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.921
<i>I'm not going to give you what you want.</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:30.218
So are you interested?

24:32.929 --> 24:36.391
-Send me her number.
-No way. She's going to be so happy.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.311
-Come on, eat.
-I don't feel like it.

24:39.394 --> 24:42.272
BRING ICE CREAM
OKAY

24:42.355 --> 24:44.274
-Can I eat the shrimp, then?
-Just eat it.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.947
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

24:51.031 --> 24:53.366
-Bow.
-Hello. And then…

24:54.618 --> 24:57.037
-Take one step forward.
-One step forward.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.955
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.000
-Are you really okay?
-Yes. I'm fine.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.418
Let's try it again.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.465
Grab each other's hands…

25:09.883 --> 25:11.134
-Go.
-Go.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.470
-One, two.
-One, two.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.764
-Turn.
-Three, four.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.849
-One, two.
-All right.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.352
-Here.
-Now? Oh, my gosh.

25:22.604 --> 25:23.980
Are you okay?

25:24.064 --> 25:26.066
You're going to break my feet soon.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.694
Should I just give up?

25:29.778 --> 25:31.571
I got scammed by Bit-na.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.823
She said this class was really easy.

25:33.907 --> 25:37.702
Do you really think it's her fault?

25:40.288 --> 25:41.623
Let's try it just once more.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.417
You seemed to have potential,
from what I saw at the club.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.503
Forget it. Stop teasing me.

25:48.004 --> 25:51.341
Why are you so good at dancing, though?
Did you learn this before?

25:51.424 --> 25:53.093
Or are you a natural?

25:53.677 --> 25:54.970
I'm not sure.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.888
My mom's a dancer.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.724
Really? Does she still dance?

26:07.315 --> 26:09.317
Do you have time this Sunday?

26:10.527 --> 26:12.904
Sunday? Well…

26:13.488 --> 26:15.448
Today's Friday, though.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.159
What?

26:19.536 --> 26:21.746
Do you think I'm a sex maniac?

26:22.330 --> 26:23.331
Then what is it?

26:23.415 --> 26:27.502
There's an exhibit that ends this weekend.
I thought we'd go together.

26:27.585 --> 26:28.878
Oh, that?

26:30.630 --> 26:32.382
I did want to go…

26:32.465 --> 26:33.717
Should we go together?

26:36.511 --> 26:38.888
I'll think about it…

26:38.972 --> 26:41.474
Let's go together, okay?

27:05.623 --> 27:07.834
<i>He probably doesn't even know
what day it is.</i>

27:08.418 --> 27:10.545
<i>I'm weird for thinking about this.</i>

27:14.841 --> 27:16.259
AUNTIE

27:21.848 --> 27:24.934
Auntie. Did you pull an all-nighter again?

27:25.018 --> 27:26.770
I should work as hard as you.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.272
I'm used to this anyway.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.858
Are you going to your mom's this Sunday?

27:31.941 --> 27:34.361
It's your birthday,
so I was thinking of visiting.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.946
<i>You don't need to come.
It'll only be tiring for you.</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:39.366
I'll visit you once the semester is over.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.785
Do you want anything as a present, then?

27:42.285 --> 27:44.037
I'll get you anything you want.

27:46.247 --> 27:48.416
Gosh, I wish you were my mom.

27:49.459 --> 27:52.712
<i>You're lucky because you have
both your mom and your aunt.</i>

27:57.425 --> 28:01.805
You should spend your birthday with
the person you want to be with the most.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.103
The person I want to be with?

28:25.620 --> 28:28.832
Hi. I just finished. I'll be there soon.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.380
This looks good.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.718
Hello.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.929
Jae-eon just left.

28:43.012 --> 28:47.100
What? Oh, I just came to apply
for late-night work.

28:48.601 --> 28:51.146
-Did you eat?
-Come sit. You can eat with us.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.022
We ordered three servings.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.399
All right.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.165
Do you have something to say?

29:12.041 --> 29:14.335
Well…

29:14.419 --> 29:18.757
Would it be weird to spend your birthday
with someone you're not dating?

29:18.840 --> 29:21.968
Then you're getting to know each other?

29:23.386 --> 29:25.263
It's not like that.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.849
But if you do everything else…

29:27.932 --> 29:30.518
Do everything else? What do you mean?

29:33.605 --> 29:37.817
Oh, then I'd say no. A birthday gift would
be fine, but spending the day together…

29:38.401 --> 29:39.903
That's a bit too much.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.947
Right?

29:43.865 --> 29:46.117
-Do you love him?
-What?

29:47.452 --> 29:50.997
No, I wasn't talking about myself.
It's about my friend.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.626
-Does she love him?
-You're always going on about love.

29:54.709 --> 29:56.586
That's not a good relationship.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.506
You're sure to regret it soon.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.509
Tell your friend to use birth control.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.137
Okay.

30:12.519 --> 30:15.188
Do you still have the butterflies?

30:15.271 --> 30:18.566
Yes. We're getting along very well.

30:20.568 --> 30:21.986
You said you'll let them go.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.865
Did I say that?

30:29.452 --> 30:33.456
I thought about it,
and I guess you were right.

30:35.708 --> 30:36.835
About what?

30:38.419 --> 30:39.921
Your butterflies.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.592
You said you were keeping them
from their freedom.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.846
I think you're right.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.142
There's a huge world
just outside the glass.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.728
You're giving them false hope.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.315
Did I say that?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.485
But…

31:03.278 --> 31:06.072
I don't want to let go. Not yet.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.116
Then at least be good to them.

31:08.199 --> 31:11.703
You know what your problem is, right?
You torment the things you like.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.126
Hang on.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.044
YU NA-BI

31:22.130 --> 31:23.631
<i>Can you talk right now?</i>

31:24.215 --> 31:26.509
Yes. What is it?

31:26.593 --> 31:28.386
<i>I just called to say</i>

31:29.470 --> 31:32.140
<i>that I can't come with you to the exhibit
this weekend.</i>

31:32.974 --> 31:34.851
<i>I'm going to see my mom.</i>

31:35.351 --> 31:36.603
Really?

31:37.604 --> 31:38.855
That's too bad.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.899
<i>Sorry. You can go with someone else.</i>

31:41.482 --> 31:42.567
All right.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.403
Is there anything else?

31:46.863 --> 31:49.449
No, that's it. Bye, then.

32:15.516 --> 32:16.726
Na-bi?

32:21.356 --> 32:22.190
Yu Na-bi?

32:25.109 --> 32:26.235
Do-hyeok?

32:27.028 --> 32:28.196
Yes.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.616
Yang Do-hyeok?

32:33.117 --> 32:35.536
Hey, it's been such a long time!

32:35.620 --> 32:38.331
Has it been about 10 years?

32:38.414 --> 32:41.709
That's right. I thought I'd never
get to see you again.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.213
Me too. What are the chances?

32:45.838 --> 32:48.007
-Are you living in Seoul?
-Yes.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.677
I'm learning to cook here
after military service.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.637
You're cooking? Like your grandpa?

32:53.721 --> 32:57.100
I'm working at a noodle place
at Hongseo University Intersection.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.727
Hongseo University Intersection?

33:01.187 --> 33:03.314
-I know that place.
-What?

33:03.815 --> 33:06.567
I never went there before,
but my friends said it was good.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.069
Really?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.363
You should come sometime.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.240
All right, I will.

33:16.619 --> 33:18.454
Do-hyeok, I have to get off.

33:19.455 --> 33:22.291
Hey, Na-bi. Here.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.335
Can you give me your number?

33:25.378 --> 33:26.212
Oh, right.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.589
Of course.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.594
Here.

33:34.804 --> 33:35.972
Oh, my gosh!

33:40.560 --> 33:41.728
Oh, no.

33:45.481 --> 33:46.816
Are you getting off?

33:47.316 --> 33:50.153
-Sir, just a minute!
-It's fine. Go.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.822
Sorry, I should go.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.764
It's raining.

34:18.973 --> 34:21.726
I'll take you to where you're going.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.146
What about your potatoes?

34:34.363 --> 34:35.907
That's so funny.

34:40.286 --> 34:43.664
How are the others?
I'm curious how they're doing.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.875
Some came to Seoul like you.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.586
I only keep in touch with a few of them.

34:50.129 --> 34:51.214
I see.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.343
I thought we'd all keep in touch
back then.

34:56.219 --> 35:00.598
I know. It would've been nice
if we had kept meeting up often.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.060
What about the noodle place?

35:04.143 --> 35:06.479
Your grandpa's noodles were amazing.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.440
He's not doing so well,
so it's closed for now.

35:10.149 --> 35:12.401
I'm preparing to run it again.

35:13.444 --> 35:15.363
Then you'll run it by yourself?

35:15.446 --> 35:16.405
For now.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.450
Just until my grandpa feels better.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.037
I can't open it right away,

35:23.121 --> 35:25.081
but I'm learning bit by bit.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.791
You're so cool.

35:27.375 --> 35:30.461
You made a big decision.
I'm sure your grandpa will be happy.

35:31.087 --> 35:34.048
I'm not sure. He always nags me
about how I'm not that reliable.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.843
I'm sure he's proud of you, though.

35:39.679 --> 35:43.057
You should come visit when I open it.
We have a guest house,

35:43.141 --> 35:46.727
and it'll be fun to hang out together.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.731
Sure, of course. I will.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.234
We're here.
I just have to turn the corner here.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.319
Oh, really?

36:00.324 --> 36:02.451
Oh, no. You're all wet.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.744
-My gosh.
-It's fine.

36:04.453 --> 36:06.122
You should have said so.

36:07.707 --> 36:12.211
It's so nice to see you again.

36:19.051 --> 36:21.637
Thanks for walking me home.
I should go inside.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.599
Right. Take this.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.268
-No, it's fine!
-I can just use my hood.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.899
Hey, Na-bi. Is it…

36:33.900 --> 36:36.944
Is it okay if I message you?

36:37.945 --> 36:38.988
Sure.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.532
Go inside, then.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.309
Ttoli!

37:08.893 --> 37:10.144
Ttoli!

37:10.228 --> 37:13.898
Hey, it's been a long time.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.373
Mom.

37:31.540 --> 37:32.625
Mom?

37:36.879 --> 37:40.800
I thought you'd come in the evening.
Why did you come so early?

37:43.970 --> 37:45.513
Stay in your room.

37:46.055 --> 37:49.934
Or why don't you go for a walk with Ttoli?

37:50.017 --> 37:52.103
Come on. Hurry.

37:52.186 --> 37:54.355
Go walk Ttoli, okay? Come on.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.107
Go, Ttoli.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.070
You're neglecting me again.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.613
What?

38:03.322 --> 38:05.449
He's going to leave soon.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.618
Just stay in your room.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.918
-You went to the signing event, right?
-Yes.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.920
-Did you take photos?
-I couldn't!

39:00.004 --> 39:02.006
You should have taken photos.

39:02.089 --> 39:04.550
I know. But he was so handsome.

39:04.633 --> 39:07.470
-Did you shake his hand?
-Of course!

39:07.553 --> 39:09.597
And you went to the concert, right?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.682
-Was it fun?
-I watched from the front row.

39:11.766 --> 39:13.309
It was amazing.

39:16.937 --> 39:19.648
<i>There was a time
when all I cared about were friends.</i>

39:19.732 --> 39:21.192
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday!

39:21.275 --> 39:24.320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

39:24.403 --> 39:26.280
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yu Na-bi</i>

39:26.364 --> 39:27.740
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

39:30.743 --> 39:32.995
Hey!

39:33.079 --> 39:35.790
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

39:35.873 --> 39:37.375
All right. My wish.

39:41.837 --> 39:43.464
<i>And when I started dating,</i>

39:44.965 --> 39:46.592
<i>I thought love was everything.</i>

39:48.886 --> 39:51.847
<i>And it's been almost two months</i>

39:51.931 --> 39:53.891
<i>since my crazy first relationship ended.</i>

40:13.160 --> 40:16.330
<i>I have friends that I talk to
and have meals with</i>

40:17.623 --> 40:18.707
<i>from time to time.</i>

40:23.879 --> 40:27.299
<i>And a friend I have sex with.</i>

40:37.309 --> 40:39.103
Do you want anything for your birthday?

40:39.186 --> 40:40.146
I want you.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.441
But where are we going?

40:44.024 --> 40:46.152
-It's a secret.
-Come on.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.738
-Why isn't the train coming?
-It's late.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.282
How about an amusement park?

40:51.365 --> 40:54.618
<i>But I don't have anyone to spend</i>

40:55.661 --> 40:56.745
<i>my birthday with.</i>

41:50.007 --> 41:52.676
THE TRAIN FOR GUJA
WILL BE ARRIVING SHORTLY

42:32.841 --> 42:34.134
I got you!

43:44.246 --> 43:46.999
<i>I thought our relationship
only existed at night.</i>

43:53.797 --> 43:55.174
Do you like your gift?

43:56.925 --> 43:59.428
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

43:59.511 --> 44:02.848
Come on. Can't you express your
happiness so I can feel proud?

44:02.931 --> 44:06.018
All right. Thank you!

44:06.101 --> 44:07.436
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

44:08.145 --> 44:09.355
Okay.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.567
But weren't you going to the exhibit?
It's the last day today.

44:15.361 --> 44:17.780
How could I think about that right now?

44:18.322 --> 44:20.199
<i>He's making me get my hopes up again.</i>

44:20.282 --> 44:21.283
Then…

44:22.284 --> 44:25.329
You got me a gift,
so let me buy you a meal.

44:25.954 --> 44:27.331
Well…

44:29.249 --> 44:30.876
Oh, do you have plans?

44:31.543 --> 44:32.628
Then--

44:32.711 --> 44:34.880
No. It's your birthday, so…

44:37.049 --> 44:39.051
INSTANT SEAWEED SOUP

44:43.305 --> 44:45.516
<i>I thought it was the worst birthday ever.</i>

44:46.392 --> 44:49.353
<i>But I guess life is full of variables.</i>

44:51.021 --> 44:52.981
Hang on. I'll make this right away.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.863
You're talking
as if you're really cooking.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.783
It's the heart that matters.

45:04.201 --> 45:07.496
It's been a while since I had
seaweed soup for my birthday.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.208
Really?

45:11.917 --> 45:14.586
I thought everyone had it except for me.

45:15.379 --> 45:16.547
I feel comforted now.

45:27.766 --> 45:28.767
What?

45:28.851 --> 45:31.019
You've never told me
something like that before.

45:32.729 --> 45:34.481
You don't talk much about yourself.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.401
Well…

45:41.989 --> 45:45.576
That's because
you know me so well already.

45:48.954 --> 45:50.706
I don't know anything about you.

45:57.421 --> 45:58.589
I really don't.

45:59.715 --> 46:01.508
You're still such a mystery to me.

46:09.975 --> 46:12.644
Stop fooling around
and finish making this.

46:13.228 --> 46:14.438
Not that.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.150
Then what?

47:21.713 --> 47:25.217
<i>Why can't you be my boyfriend?</i>

47:29.179 --> 47:31.807
So when are you going to make me
the seaweed soup?

47:34.184 --> 47:35.519
I'll make it now.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.105
Why aren't you getting up, then?

47:38.897 --> 47:41.066
I have no energy. Five more minutes.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.331
SEOL-A

47:59.543 --> 48:00.502
Let me take a call.

48:01.795 --> 48:03.088
Hang on.

48:08.176 --> 48:10.345
Should we have a drink first?

48:10.429 --> 48:13.015
Or go right away?

48:13.098 --> 48:15.517
Well, whatever you prefer.

48:21.773 --> 48:23.525
Let's drink here.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.698
What's your ideal type?

48:29.781 --> 48:30.991
-Me?
-Yes.

48:35.287 --> 48:36.246
Are you okay?

48:38.707 --> 48:40.292
Yes. I'm okay.

48:49.092 --> 48:53.013
This place is actually pretty lame.

48:56.099 --> 48:57.726
-Let's drink somewhere else.
-What?

48:57.809 --> 48:59.853
-Let's go.
-Somewhere else?

49:11.323 --> 49:12.908
Do you know her?

49:13.533 --> 49:15.202
No, I don't.

49:15.285 --> 49:17.621
Excuse me. Can I have some ice water?

49:21.958 --> 49:24.836
Sorry. Something urgent came up
with a friend.

49:26.713 --> 49:28.632
Okay. You should go, then.

49:29.216 --> 49:33.261
Make sure to eat.
And don't ignore your mom.

49:35.847 --> 49:37.015
I'll get going.

49:38.058 --> 49:39.226
Okay.

50:10.382 --> 50:11.842
I'm hungry.

51:10.358 --> 51:11.777
Do-hyeok…

51:20.118 --> 51:21.495
Come in.

51:27.125 --> 51:29.211
Sorry. You're closed, right? I…

51:29.294 --> 51:30.420
We're not.

51:37.594 --> 51:40.806
What? You have 3,000 subscribers?

51:41.389 --> 51:42.933
You started only three months ago.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.643
You have so many views.

51:44.726 --> 51:46.686
Do you edit the videos yourself?

51:47.437 --> 51:48.647
Yes.

51:50.524 --> 51:52.234
GRANDSON OF A NOODLE SHOP OWNER

51:52.317 --> 51:54.569
I saw this before.

51:55.445 --> 51:58.031
The channel name reminded me of you.

51:58.114 --> 51:59.616
You thought about me?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.451
Of course.

52:03.328 --> 52:05.789
I can't believe it really was you.

52:05.872 --> 52:07.332
And a culinary arts major?

52:08.500 --> 52:12.128
The Yang Do-hyeok I know

52:12.212 --> 52:14.923
always played with food.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.512
I knew you'd major in art, though.

52:21.429 --> 52:23.348
You were always good at drawing.

52:25.642 --> 52:27.018
Well…

52:28.979 --> 52:30.188
Not that good.

52:30.730 --> 52:32.482
I just liked it.

52:36.653 --> 52:38.572
Your videos are really good.

52:42.742 --> 52:43.743
Here you go.

52:48.832 --> 52:51.167
Weren't you making noodles for me?

52:51.793 --> 52:52.878
Next time.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.755
Isn't it your birthday today?

52:57.007 --> 52:58.466
You're right.

53:02.262 --> 53:04.931
You have a good memory.
You remembered my birthday?

53:05.557 --> 53:06.641
Of course, I…

53:10.520 --> 53:12.606
I have a good memory.

53:13.189 --> 53:14.107
Right.

53:14.774 --> 53:17.027
-Do you still like chocolate?
-Yes.

53:19.529 --> 53:21.239
Did you make this yourself, too?

53:22.032 --> 53:24.075
-Yes.
-You're so skilled.

53:24.159 --> 53:25.410
It looks delicious.

53:30.498 --> 53:31.499
What?

53:33.960 --> 53:35.170
Make a wish.

53:36.296 --> 53:37.672
A wish?

53:38.590 --> 53:39.841
All right.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.278
Happy birthday, Na-bi.

54:01.279 --> 54:04.491
Thank you. I can't believe
I'm with you like this on my birthday.

54:04.574 --> 54:06.493
Life is full of surprises.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.996
I know.
I never imagined this would happen.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.459
-It's so good.
-Really?

54:14.542 --> 54:16.127
-Yes!
-That's a relief.

54:16.711 --> 54:18.630
I felt this last time,

54:18.713 --> 54:21.508
but it's not awkward
even when we haven't met for a long time.

54:22.008 --> 54:24.260
Maybe since we're childhood friends.

54:24.344 --> 54:25.637
Do you think so?

54:25.720 --> 54:28.014
What's that response? Do you feel awkward?

54:29.432 --> 54:31.726
I feel kind of nervous.

54:37.774 --> 54:41.319
Remember when we had a birthday party
at the beach?

54:41.403 --> 54:42.654
Yes. Right.

54:43.947 --> 54:44.948
Of course I remember.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.410
We set up a tent and made <i>ramyeon</i>.

54:48.493 --> 54:51.121
Right. And we played with fireworks.

54:51.871 --> 54:53.123
Right.

54:53.206 --> 54:54.916
It was so fun.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.378
I want to go back to that moment.

55:37.500 --> 55:38.752
Do you like your gift?

55:40.378 --> 55:43.006
I've never been forced to receive
a gift like this.

55:43.590 --> 55:45.133
Wear it tomorrow, okay?

56:13.870 --> 56:15.997
-Hello?
-<i>Are you at school?</i>

56:16.081 --> 56:16.998
Yes. Why?

56:17.082 --> 56:20.001
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

56:20.835 --> 56:22.253
Me too.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.605
It looks good on you.

56:44.484 --> 56:46.277
Because you bought it?

56:46.361 --> 56:48.863
Well, the model is pretty.

56:51.324 --> 56:52.408
You're right.

56:54.577 --> 56:56.412
Right, I made up with my mom.

56:56.496 --> 56:58.456
Well, it was more like

56:58.540 --> 57:00.834
I just listened to her talk and hung up.

57:02.585 --> 57:03.795
Good job.

57:06.256 --> 57:09.259
What about you?
You went to see your friend.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.719
Right.

57:13.555 --> 57:14.681
It wasn't anything good.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.518
<i>He's drawing the line again.</i>

57:23.898 --> 57:25.442
Why aren't you giving me one?

57:26.484 --> 57:28.194
What flavor is it?

57:40.290 --> 57:42.417
Are you crazy? We're at school!

57:43.877 --> 57:46.629
A pretty girl was gazing at me, asking me

57:47.547 --> 57:49.007
the flavor of my candy.

57:55.180 --> 57:57.390
I was only looking at your candy.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.270
-This?
-Yes, that.

58:05.064 --> 58:06.107
It tastes good, right?

58:07.275 --> 58:08.818
-Is it good?
-No.

58:08.902 --> 58:10.445
-It's not?
-No.

58:11.488 --> 58:14.574
There's something between them.
And my friend said

58:14.657 --> 58:18.203
she saw Jae-eon several times at the
convenience store near Na-bi's house.

58:18.286 --> 58:20.872
Come on. She lives near our school.

58:20.955 --> 58:22.916
He never goes to that convenience store.

58:23.958 --> 58:26.461
You know so much about Jae-eon, honey.

58:26.544 --> 58:28.087
Did you just call me "honey"?

58:28.171 --> 58:30.048
Come to think of it,

58:30.131 --> 58:32.842
they were giving each other looks
before they disappeared!

58:32.926 --> 58:34.636
Are they dating, then?

58:35.720 --> 58:37.472
Jae-eon doesn't date.

58:37.555 --> 58:39.682
Then are they just sleeping
with each other?

58:39.766 --> 58:41.976
You can gossip among yourselves later.

58:43.019 --> 58:45.813
We still have to discuss the venue
and budget of our workshop.

58:45.897 --> 58:48.149
Didn't we decide to finish this
in an hour?

58:48.233 --> 58:50.735
Come on, don't be so serious.

58:50.818 --> 58:52.195
It's all right.

58:52.278 --> 58:54.489
I guess he's in a hurry to go on a date.

58:55.114 --> 58:56.658
Let's finish up quickly.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.373
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine. Sit down.

59:05.083 --> 59:08.127
The professor wants us to check
the venue in person beforehand.

59:08.211 --> 59:10.129
We should go this weekend.

59:10.713 --> 59:12.465
Who can't make it?

59:17.178 --> 59:19.764
What? You can't make it, Jae-eon?

59:20.682 --> 59:21.766
No.

59:23.601 --> 59:24.644
Why?

59:31.150 --> 59:32.569
Hey, Na-bi!

59:33.111 --> 59:35.446
Why are you so dressed up today?

59:35.530 --> 59:37.490
-Is it okay?
-It looks great on you.

59:40.910 --> 59:42.370
Why weren't you at school?

59:42.453 --> 59:45.290
I was a little sick.
Don't you think I lost some weight?

59:45.873 --> 59:48.042
Yes, it looks like it. Are you okay now?

59:48.126 --> 59:50.920
I'm fine.
Right, and how was your birthday?

59:51.004 --> 59:52.547
Sorry I couldn't contact you.

59:52.630 --> 59:54.215
You don't need to be sorry.

59:54.757 --> 59:58.052
Did you talk to Sol?
She seemed pretty worried about you.

59:58.970 --> 1:00:02.140
The weather's really nice today.

1:00:02.724 --> 1:00:05.351
-It's totally spring, isn't it?
-It is.

1:00:07.186 --> 1:00:09.147
I don't want to work on assignments.

1:00:09.230 --> 1:00:11.608
Hey, Na-bi. You look so pretty.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:12.984
-Here to work?
-So pretty.

1:00:13.067 --> 1:00:15.612
-We're just having a short meeting.
-They're both pretty.

1:00:17.655 --> 1:00:18.740
Okay.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:21.659
Go on.

1:00:32.670 --> 1:00:34.714
What about me?

1:00:34.797 --> 1:00:36.424
It's been a while, Ji-wan.

1:00:36.507 --> 1:00:38.551
Why did you suddenly go off the grid?

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.219
I was a bit sick.

1:00:42.430 --> 1:00:45.099
How does a fit girl like you
suddenly get sick?

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:47.143
I know. Ji-wan is built like a brick.

1:00:47.226 --> 1:00:48.895
What were you sick with?

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:53.066
Well, Jae-eon can't come
since he has plans.

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:54.651
Anyone else who can't come?

1:00:55.693 --> 1:00:59.489
Na-bi. We're going to check the venue
for our workshop. Want to come?

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:01.616
Well…

1:01:06.537 --> 1:01:08.414
I have plans.

1:01:09.332 --> 1:01:12.585
Right. If you have plans, I guess not.

1:01:29.268 --> 1:01:32.230
Na-bi and Jae-eon really seem
to be dating, right?

1:01:32.730 --> 1:01:34.774
I thought Na-bi had a crush on me.

1:01:35.483 --> 1:01:38.236
Are you still on about that?

1:01:39.237 --> 1:01:41.447
Do you guys want to go out for drinks?

1:01:41.531 --> 1:01:42.990
I have plans.

1:01:44.701 --> 1:01:46.619
Me too. I have plans, too.

1:01:59.257 --> 1:02:01.801
Jeez…

1:02:10.351 --> 1:02:11.477
What are you doing here?

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:14.355
Na-bi. I'm really heartbroken.

1:02:14.439 --> 1:02:16.190
I know you're in a lot of pain after--

1:02:16.274 --> 1:02:17.734
What are you talking about?

1:02:20.653 --> 1:02:23.740
I heard the rumors. A lot of my students
attend your school.

1:02:23.823 --> 1:02:26.784
I keep hearing rumors about you,
even if I try not to.

1:02:26.868 --> 1:02:28.035
What do you mean?

1:02:29.162 --> 1:02:31.456
-What rumors?
-I heard you're seeing

1:02:32.165 --> 1:02:34.459
some jerk named Park Jae-eon or something.

1:02:35.209 --> 1:02:37.211
I heard he sleeps with everybody.

1:02:37.295 --> 1:02:39.797
I was so shocked when I heard
you were seeing him.

1:02:44.677 --> 1:02:47.221
I don't enjoy hearing that about my ex.

1:02:49.682 --> 1:02:50.767
Let go of me.

1:02:51.809 --> 1:02:54.187
You're giving me advice?
Who do you think you are?

1:02:54.270 --> 1:02:57.106
What? Then it's true?
You're seeing that jerk?

1:02:57.190 --> 1:02:59.066
Who are you to call him a jerk?

1:02:59.150 --> 1:03:00.693
-Yu Na-bi!
-What?

1:03:04.071 --> 1:03:06.324
You're not that kind of girl.

1:03:06.407 --> 1:03:10.745
You must've been lonely after we broke up.
But still, seeing a guy like that?

1:03:10.828 --> 1:03:12.330
Shut up and get lost.

1:03:19.253 --> 1:03:20.713
Hey, Na-bi…

1:03:23.549 --> 1:03:26.844
LAUNDRY

1:03:38.105 --> 1:03:40.149
That bastard.
Who is he to say such things?

1:04:04.090 --> 1:04:06.551
<i>I feel like I'm doing something wrong.</i>

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:10.096
Don't you know any hot girls?

1:04:10.805 --> 1:04:13.057
Ask Jae-eon to introduce you.

1:04:14.141 --> 1:04:15.017
Park Jae-eon?

1:04:15.810 --> 1:04:18.229
To be honest,
we don't feel comfortable with him.

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.566
Why? Did something happen?

1:04:21.649 --> 1:04:24.777
Don't you feel that he shows off
about being popular?

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:27.238
When I asked him to introduce me
to a girl,

1:04:27.321 --> 1:04:31.033
he said something about feeling guilty
towards them. It totally pissed me off.

1:04:31.617 --> 1:04:34.453
Jae-eon really said that to you?

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:36.163
He did.

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:38.082
He's so rude just because he's popular.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:40.042
We don't think of him as a real friend.

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:42.295
The others don't consider him
a friend, either.

1:04:42.378 --> 1:04:45.298
They just keep him close
since he's good-looking, that's all.

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:48.593
His target is Na-bi these days.

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:50.845
They seem to be getting close.

1:04:50.928 --> 1:04:52.430
I could totally tell.

1:04:53.055 --> 1:04:54.849
I did hear about that.

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:57.310
So the rumors spread already.

1:04:57.393 --> 1:04:59.353
Jae-eon has nothing to lose.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:00.563
He must be so proud.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:04.984
I didn't think Na-bi would be like that.
She must be pretty open-minded…

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:09.405
Open-minded?
That's just a nice way to put it.

1:05:10.114 --> 1:05:13.451
You really can't judge a book
by its cover.

1:05:14.368 --> 1:05:16.162
I should get going now.

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:18.247
Okay. Let's go together.

1:05:23.502 --> 1:05:24.712
Yu Na-bi?

1:05:28.257 --> 1:05:29.926
Hello, Professor.

1:05:32.845 --> 1:05:34.096
Is this for the exhibit?

1:05:35.431 --> 1:05:37.975
Yes, I'm thinking of handing this one in.

1:05:46.567 --> 1:05:48.194
Is something troubling you?

1:05:48.277 --> 1:05:49.695
It's in pretty bad shape.

1:05:50.404 --> 1:05:51.739
<i>A right hook.</i>

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:57.161
But still, if you focus well
and keep working on it,

1:05:57.995 --> 1:05:59.455
it could be a decent piece.

1:05:59.538 --> 1:06:02.083
All right. I'll work harder.

1:06:17.974 --> 1:06:22.478
People gossip about others

1:06:22.561 --> 1:06:24.814
and criticize others so easily.

1:06:24.897 --> 1:06:27.858
It's especially worse in Korea,
since it's a small country.

1:06:29.151 --> 1:06:32.613
That's why you should be careful
when you're young.

1:06:33.614 --> 1:06:36.993
You might think reckless behavior
can be forgiven because you're young.

1:06:40.162 --> 1:06:42.790
But from what I experienced,
it's not the case.

1:06:43.374 --> 1:06:44.583
There are consequences.

1:06:44.667 --> 1:06:47.837
You'll get hit with the aftermath
at a crucial moment later on.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:49.380
<i>A left hook.</i>

1:06:49.463 --> 1:06:52.216
No one will take responsibility
for your own life.

1:06:52.299 --> 1:06:55.845
So keep your head on straight.
You're graduating soon, you know.

1:06:55.928 --> 1:06:58.347
Everyone finds a job
before they graduate these days.

1:06:58.973 --> 1:07:00.683
<i>And an uppercut.</i>

1:07:01.517 --> 1:07:02.601
Right.

1:07:03.436 --> 1:07:04.854
I know how you feel,

1:07:04.937 --> 1:07:08.065
so I'm giving you advice since
I care about you. So keep that in mind.

1:07:08.899 --> 1:07:10.234
Yes, Professor.

1:07:10.943 --> 1:07:13.863
-Focus on your work.
-I will.

1:07:20.745 --> 1:07:21.954
<i>KO.</i>

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:36.802
<i>It feels like</i>

1:07:36.886 --> 1:07:40.347
<i>the whole universe is telling me
to end it with Jae-eon.</i>

1:07:41.182 --> 1:07:42.349
Na-bi.

1:07:44.894 --> 1:07:48.022
Are you okay? You could've
fallen down on the trash.

1:07:48.898 --> 1:07:51.108
Yes, I'm fine.

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:54.070
This is good timing.

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:57.156
Could we meet for a moment later?
Just the two of us?

1:07:59.241 --> 1:08:01.660
Well, I like that you're asking first,

1:08:02.369 --> 1:08:05.122
but I'll be a bit tired
since I have lots of work today.

1:08:06.665 --> 1:08:09.251
What? I'm not talking about that.

1:08:11.545 --> 1:08:13.631
Let's talk.

1:08:14.757 --> 1:08:17.551
Okay. Will it be okay
to meet late at night?

1:08:17.635 --> 1:08:18.761
Yes, it's fine.

1:08:20.054 --> 1:08:21.514
I'll call you when I'm done.

1:08:23.015 --> 1:08:24.016
Okay.

1:08:35.736 --> 1:08:38.447
-Let's send it to the professor tomorrow.
-Okay.

1:08:38.531 --> 1:08:40.407
She won't read it until tomorrow anyway.

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:50.626
-Aren't you leaving?
-What?

1:08:51.168 --> 1:08:56.048
Oh, well… I'm just going to finish
reading the paper I was looking at.

1:08:58.008 --> 1:08:59.051
Where is it?

1:08:59.135 --> 1:09:01.679
All right, then. I'll be off first.

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:04.181
Okay. Bye.

1:09:06.350 --> 1:09:10.187
I thought about it, and I guess
I must have lost it after breaking up.

1:09:10.271 --> 1:09:12.106
I don't know why I'm doing this

1:09:12.189 --> 1:09:14.108
with you.

1:09:17.444 --> 1:09:18.779
What do you mean?

1:09:21.365 --> 1:09:23.951
I want to focus on my work and school.

1:09:26.579 --> 1:09:28.455
This is an important time for me.

1:09:30.249 --> 1:09:32.168
I guess I'm talking too much, right?

1:09:32.877 --> 1:09:36.839
Yes. Aren't you going overboard?
We're not even going out.

1:09:41.343 --> 1:09:42.553
We should end it.

1:09:48.142 --> 1:09:50.352
Does this sound like I want to cut ties?

1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:57.568
But whatever I say,

1:09:57.651 --> 1:10:00.946
Jae-eon won't even blink an eye.

1:10:06.952 --> 1:10:10.789
<i>He's always so relaxed and calm,
but I'm always anxious.</i>

1:10:10.873 --> 1:10:14.335
<i>My ex cheated on me,
I got rejected by a guy who liked me,</i>

1:10:14.418 --> 1:10:16.962
<i>and rumors spread about me
being sex partners with the guy I like.</i>

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:22.176
It sounds even worse like that.

1:10:31.018 --> 1:10:32.436
<i>We should end it.</i>

1:10:33.354 --> 1:10:34.939
<i>That's all I have to say.</i>

1:10:52.623 --> 1:10:53.916
Let's talk.

1:10:53.999 --> 1:10:55.626
You have more to say?

1:10:57.253 --> 1:11:00.464
To be honest, I don't get
why you're so upset.

1:11:02.341 --> 1:11:04.426
You didn't need to ghost me like that.

1:11:08.555 --> 1:11:10.307
I said I'll see you at your house.

1:11:12.059 --> 1:11:14.311
I thought you'd take a long time.

1:11:15.479 --> 1:11:18.899
I thought I'd finish by 10 p.m.,
but it's taking longer than expected.

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:20.526
Right.

1:11:22.319 --> 1:11:23.445
I see.

1:11:23.529 --> 1:11:27.074
<i>I ran thousands of simulations
inside my head…</i>

1:11:28.158 --> 1:11:29.576
You look pretty serious.

1:11:32.162 --> 1:11:33.622
What did you want to say?

1:11:33.706 --> 1:11:36.000
<i>But the moment I looked into his eyes,</i>

1:11:37.543 --> 1:11:39.628
<i>my mind went blank.</i>

1:11:39.712 --> 1:11:41.005
Well…

1:11:43.590 --> 1:11:45.884
My ex-boyfriend came to my house.

1:11:45.968 --> 1:11:48.721
He seemed to have heard rumors about us.

1:11:50.931 --> 1:11:52.808
He said I should just date him instead.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:57.021
What did you say?

1:11:58.022 --> 1:11:59.773
I told him not to talk nonsense.

1:12:01.025 --> 1:12:02.026
Really?

1:12:02.109 --> 1:12:05.070
<i>"Really?" Is that it?</i>

1:12:10.159 --> 1:12:11.827
Is that what you wanted to say?

1:12:16.790 --> 1:12:19.126
Is there someone else you're seeing?

1:12:19.209 --> 1:12:20.627
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

1:12:21.128 --> 1:12:23.672
<i>Why am I asking this
when I was about to end everything?</i>

1:12:28.802 --> 1:12:29.887
No.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:32.222
Really?

1:12:48.072 --> 1:12:49.531
Excuse me.

1:12:50.115 --> 1:12:52.743
Are you Park Jae-eon, by any chance?

1:12:53.869 --> 1:12:55.204
Yes.

1:12:56.872 --> 1:12:58.248
So it's you.

1:13:01.293 --> 1:13:03.087
You bastard!

1:13:05.005 --> 1:13:06.882
Sir! What's wrong?

1:13:06.965 --> 1:13:09.009
-What are you doing?
-Move.

1:13:09.093 --> 1:13:10.511
-Wait!
-Move!

1:13:10.594 --> 1:13:13.180
-Why are you doing this?
-Get out of the way!

1:13:15.265 --> 1:13:16.225
Na-bi!

1:14:11.697 --> 1:14:15.742
<i>Park Jae-eon has never been mine.
But it feels like I've lost him.</i>

1:14:15.826 --> 1:14:18.495
<i>How could Na-bi date a guy like Jae-eon?</i>

1:14:18.579 --> 1:14:22.166
-My girlfriend?
-Call me. Even if it's nothing special.

1:14:22.249 --> 1:14:25.210
<i>My whole house is filled
with traces of Jae-eon.</i>

1:14:25.294 --> 1:14:26.128
<i>Jerk.</i>

1:14:26.837 --> 1:14:28.338
<i>I guess it worked.</i>

1:14:28.422 --> 1:14:30.007
<i>How long are you going to avoid me?</i>

1:14:30.090 --> 1:14:31.884
We didn't get to finish
what we were talking about.

1:14:31.967 --> 1:14:35.721
This is how we always make up.
As if nothing happened.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:37.514
I just picked it up, thinking of you.

1:14:37.598 --> 1:14:39.558
-A gift for me?
-Yes.

1:14:39.641 --> 1:14:41.351
I was jealous.
Good luck on your presentation.

1:14:41.435 --> 1:14:43.854
<i>Who would like to assist Yu Na-bi?</i>

1:14:43.937 --> 1:14:46.023
I thought it'd be fun. Seems interesting.

1:14:46.106 --> 1:14:47.983
<i>Hey, Seol-a. I'll be there right away.</i>

1:14:48.066 --> 1:14:50.360
<i>How can he not even call once?</i>

1:14:50.444 --> 1:14:51.904
<i>I miss him.</i>

1:14:52.446 --> 1:14:56.575
