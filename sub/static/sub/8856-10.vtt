THE SECOND-BORN ED BOY.

19:09.500 --> 19:13.083
ROLF DOES NOT MEAN
TO INTRUDE, LESSER
OF THE 2 OFFSPRINGS.

19:13.167 --> 19:18.250
BUT ROLF HUMBLY OFFERS
EDDY'S BROTHER THIS TOKEN.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.875
HEY, KEV, FETCH ME
SOME MORE SODA,
WILL YOU?

19:20.958 --> 19:24.583
WHEN'S YOUR BROTHER
GETTING HERE, ANYWAY?

19:25.167 --> 19:25.875
GOT ANY DIP?

19:25.958 --> 19:27.250
I'LL DIP YOU,
YOU DORK.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.083
I SUPPOSE A GLASS
OF WATER WOULD BE OUT
OF THE QUESTION, THEN?

19:30.167 --> 19:33.167
Rolf: SILENCE! IT WAS
ROLF'S TURN TO GROVEL!

19:33.250 --> 19:34.958
AS ROLF WAS SAYING...

19:35.042 --> 19:37.125
ROLF OFFERS THIS GIFT
TO EDDY'S BROTHER--

19:37.208 --> 19:39.542
A VEST MADE FROM THE HAIR
OF PAPA'S BACK--

19:39.625 --> 19:43.583
IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE SAFETY OF ROLF'S
UNOFFENDING CHICKENS.

19:43.667 --> 19:46.542
Ed: COOL.

19:46.625 --> 19:51.167
THANK YOU, ED BOY,

20:01.708 --> 20:03.208
THERE'S THE BALL,
SARAH.

20:03.042 --> 20:05.333
HIYA,
BABY SISTER.

20:06.042 --> 20:06.833
YOU DARE HIT

20:06.917 --> 20:08.917
THE BROTHER
OF EDDY'S BROTHER!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.167
BROTHERS ARE STUPID.

20:10.250 --> 20:15.208
OH, YEAH? WHY DON'T
YOU TELL HIM THAT
TO HIS FACE, THEN?

20:15.042 --> 20:16.208
[ALL GASP]

20:16.292 --> 20:18.042
FINE. SO,
WHERE'S HIS FACE?

20:18.125 --> 20:19.417
Kevin:
WHERE IS HE, MAN?

20:19.500 --> 20:23.792
Rolf: ROLF SMELL
SOMETHING, AND IT'S NOT
PAPA'S BACK HAIR VEST.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.250
IS HE
COMING,
EDDY?

20:28.167 --> 20:31.667
EDDY, EVERYTHING'S
BECOME DISTORTED,
MUDDLED, AND MIXED UP.

20:31.750 --> 20:36.125
END THIS CHARADE.
NOW IS THE TIME
TO GAIN THAT RESPECT.

20:36.208 --> 20:40.208
Eddy: OK. I GUESS
I SHOULD TELL YOU,
HE AIN'T SHOWING UP...

20:40.292 --> 20:42.417
TODAY...'CAUSE HE...
MISSED THE BUS!

20:42.500 --> 20:45.333
YEAH, AND HE'LL
BE AT MY HOUSE
TOMORROW AT LUNCH!

20:45.417 --> 20:47.333
Kevin: AWESOME.
CAN WE COME OVER?

20:47.417 --> 20:48.875
ROLF WILL JOIN YOU,
KEVIN.

20:48.958 --> 20:51.167
COOL. I HEARD
HE'S SO STRONG.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.542
Jimmy: IS HE, EDDY?

20:52.625 --> 20:53.708
YEP!

20:53.792 --> 20:56.625
I BET.
COME ON, JIMMY.

20:56.708 --> 20:58.667
HA HA HA!

20:59.833 --> 21:03.125
THEY'RE STILL
SITTING OUT THERE.
WHAT SHEEP!

21:03.208 --> 21:04.458
YOUR RUMOR
IS A MONSTER

21:04.542 --> 21:06.250
FEEDING
ON EVERYONE'S
INSECURITIES.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.417
STOP IT
BEFORE IT'S
TOO LATE.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.542
IT'S JUST A LITTLE FIB,
DOUBLE DEE.

21:10.625 --> 21:12.667
KEVIN WOULD POUND
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME

21:12.750 --> 21:14.917
IF I TOLD HIM MY BROTHER
AIN'T SHOWIN' UP.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.750
DID HE MISS
ANOTHER BUS, EDDY?

21:16.833 --> 21:19.083
BUSES CAN BE
SO CRUEL.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.125
Voice: AND HARD
ON THE CABOOSE,

21:21.208 --> 21:22.333
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

21:22.417 --> 21:24.583
UM, EDDY,

AT YOUR DOOR.

21:24.667 --> 21:28.542
Eddy: IT'S PROBABLY KEVIN.
I'M READY FOR HIM.
