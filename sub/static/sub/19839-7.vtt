00:11.240 --> 00:16.160
- (O'Neill) What's your reading, Major?
- (Carter) It should be here somewhere.

00:23.440 --> 00:28.560
Teal'c, you said the UAV was shot down
by the Goa'uld, yet there's no sign of 'em.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.560
It's hard to tell. The sensors
went off-line as soon as it was hit.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.600
Over here.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

00:52.480 --> 00:56.920
- Looks like it's been hit by a staff blast.
- It doesn't make any sense.

00:57.080 --> 01:01.200
When a Goa'uld occupies a planet,
they control the Stargate. This gate...

01:03.400 --> 01:06.680
- Found something.
- Fall back!

01:08.280 --> 01:09.600
Uh, sir...

01:09.760 --> 01:11.680
All right, heads up.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.000
(distorted) Your weapons
will not penetrate the shield!

01:24.280 --> 01:26.200
However, mine will.

01:35.040 --> 01:38.520
- Who are you?
- Aris Boch. Perhaps you've heard of me?

01:39.440 --> 01:40.640
(O'Neill) Uh...

01:41.760 --> 01:45.040
- Not l. Teal'c?
- I have not.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.320
Well, that's disappointing.
I'm one of the galaxy's greatest hunters.

01:50.480 --> 01:52.040
Not ringing a bell. Sorry.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.400
Well, I know you.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.440
Captain Samantha Carter.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.120
Dr Daniel Jackson.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.760
The Jaffa traitor Teal'c.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
And Colonel Jack O'Neill.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.880
Well, fancy that.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.240
We're famous.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.560
- Drop your weapons.
- And if we don't?

03:23.400 --> 03:25.440
Do we really have to get so dramatic?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.440
Why not?

03:31.160 --> 03:32.480
(laughs)

03:33.080 --> 03:37.160
You are thinking of the personal
defence shields the Goa'uld use.

03:37.320 --> 03:40.960
The ones which allow
slower-moving objects to pass through.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.800
Wouldn't make a very effective trap,
would they?

03:43.960 --> 03:48.440
- You can't blame a girl for trying.
- That's exactly what I'd expect from you.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.880
Now, drop your weapons...

03:52.040 --> 03:55.360
..or I'll kill someone.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.280
I'm sure you're thinking about escaping,...

04:05.440 --> 04:08.720
..so I've disabled
the Stargate dialling device.

04:08.880 --> 04:12.400
Even if you did overpower me,
which is unlikely,...

04:12.920 --> 04:15.320
..you'll never get off this planet.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.000
This way.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.320
Everybody stop.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.160
Drop your gear.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.000
I don't suppose we could talk about this?

04:57.440 --> 04:59.480
- Inside.
- Inside what?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.560
Barokna.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.440
Inside.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.720
Goa'uld cargo transport.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.480
The ship's of an older design. I have never
before seen the cloaking technology.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.560
It's an upgrade.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.720
Let's go.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.240
(beeping)

06:04.360 --> 06:06.920
Sir, he's not Goa'uld.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.720
And...? What? So? Therefore?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.320
(whirring)

06:17.360 --> 06:19.800
Sounds as if Aris Boch has left the vessel.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.280
Well, let's use the time
to find a way out of this, huh?

06:23.440 --> 06:26.440
Even if we find a way out,
he's disabled the Stargate.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.320
Teal'c, how fast will this unit fly?

06:31.480 --> 06:35.560
I believe it is capable of travelling
twice the speed of light.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.760
Nice. Home for dinner.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.800
Uh, sir, if you're thinking of trying
to steal the ship and fly it back to Earth,...

06:43.960 --> 06:49.520
..even at 372,000 miles per second, it'd
still take at least 10 years to get that far.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.520
Shoulda let the dog out.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.480
(gasps)

07:04.360 --> 07:06.280
(mutters)

07:14.400 --> 07:16.320
(door opens)

07:20.960 --> 07:22.880
(beeping)

07:26.960 --> 07:28.880
Back up with the others.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.960
Now.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.040
All we have to do is just flinch a bit...

07:40.160 --> 07:44.880
..and this will spray enough toxic gas
to kill everybody in one breath.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.040
Dr Jackson,...

07:57.640 --> 08:00.040
..if you don't mind...

08:00.200 --> 08:02.400
..treating my wound.

08:02.560 --> 08:06.320
- I'm an archaeologist.
- I know, but you're also a doctor.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.040
Of archaeology.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.000
(sighs)

08:10.160 --> 08:12.040
Never mind. Captain,...

08:13.080 --> 08:15.160
..you must have medical training.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.560
- Actually, I'm a major now.
- Oh!

08:17.720 --> 08:21.280
Well, how very important.
I'll inform the galaxy.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.520
Can you get over here now
and help me, Major?

08:32.159 --> 08:34.080
This with this,...

08:34.240 --> 08:36.440
..and then this.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.400
- Argh!
- Sorry.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.480
- Yeah!
- (O'Neill) So...

08:54.640 --> 08:57.240
- Who shot you?
- I wouldn't step any closer.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.600
Just... showing my concern.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.760
Like I said before,
capturing you was unintentional.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.920
The real reason I'm here
is to catch a Goa'uld.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.640
- You hunt Goa'uld?
- I hunt anyone of value.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.280
- Which Goa'uld are you hunting?
- His name is Kel'tar.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.880
- I haven't heard of him before.
- Contrary to popular human belief...

09:20.040 --> 09:22.520
..the Earth is not the centre of the galaxy.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.560
- I have not heard of him either.
- Have you met every Goa'uld?

09:28.560 --> 09:30.520
I haven't. The only thing I know...

09:30.680 --> 09:34.560
..is that Sokar has discovered
Kel'tar's plotting against him.

09:34.720 --> 09:36.960
- So you work for Sokar?
- No.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.680
Self-employed, then?
lndependent contractor? Rogue warrior?

09:41.840 --> 09:45.920
I give to the Goa'uld what they want,
and they give back to me what I want.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.640
- How do you keep from getting killed?
- Talent.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.560
So, how do you keep from getting killed?

09:53.800 --> 09:56.400
So, what do you expect to get for us?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.800
- Daniel...
- Just curious.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.520
Well, uh, Teal'c is worth the most.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.560
The System Lords would love
to make a good example of him.

10:06.720 --> 10:11.840
And Carter here... well, she has
the memories of the Tok'ra Jolinar.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.160
You, O'Neill, you're considered...
You're a pain in the mikta!

10:19.080 --> 10:21.640
- Neck?
- No.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.480
- What about me?
- You?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.800
I'll be happy with a day's rations.

10:28.360 --> 10:31.080
- Oh, a day's rations...
- Trade you.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.040
If we know our worth, maybe
we can offer something for our freedom.

10:36.440 --> 10:37.720
Done.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.800
Good. Back over there.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.360
Dr Jackson is right.
There is something you can do.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.880
Let's hear it.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.720
You help me capture a Goa'uld...
and I'll let you go.

10:50.880 --> 10:54.760
- He's worth that much?
- Twice as much as all of you together.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.240
- Twice?
- Twice.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.920
What, are you gonna argue?

11:02.800 --> 11:06.280
- Why do you need our help anyway?
- I take help whenever I can.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.080
This injury is gonna take time to heal.
I don't have that luxury.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.480
Sokar can figure out
everything I can figure out.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.400
If I want to trade Kel'tar back to Sokar,
I gotta get to him first.

11:19.480 --> 11:25.280
- How do we know we can trust you?
- My word is good on over 2,000 planets.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.040
- There are billions.
- It would appear we have no choice.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.280
Yes. Choiceless.

11:32.440 --> 11:37.160
I mean, guys, come on!
What's the big deal? It's a Goa'uld!

11:37.800 --> 11:42.520
I hate Goa'uld. You hate 'em.
Everybody hates Goa'ulds.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.680
Yeah, OK. We'll do it.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.760
Good.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.000
You and you come with me.
You two stay here.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.800
- Wait a minute...
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh...

12:02.440 --> 12:04.840
- Choiceless?
- You see, that's why I like you.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.920
You're quick. Let's go.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.000
Oh, yeah.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.120
(beeping)

12:39.520 --> 12:41.440
You trust me... I trust you.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.920
What's that?

12:52.360 --> 12:54.280
Drink.

12:58.600 --> 13:03.720
So what exactly do you have in mind
regarding the capture of this Goa'uld?

13:03.880 --> 13:07.160
- What was his name? Kevlar?
- (Boch) Kel'tar.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.320
You two are gonna surrender to him.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.680
That's a bad plan.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.400
What if he shoots first
and takes prisoners later?

13:15.840 --> 13:18.120
That's your problem. Let's go.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.120
You know, if you really were
the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy,...

13:24.280 --> 13:27.400
..you'd grab that Goa'uld yourself
and turn us all in.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.280
And miss the chance of watching
the great Jack O'Neill in action?

13:31.440 --> 13:35.720
Do you want to know how I became
the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy?

13:35.880 --> 13:39.320
- More than life itself.
- I'm the greatest because I'm alive.

13:39.480 --> 13:41.400
That's it. Period.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.040
I'm not greedy. If I can catch
a Goa'uld equipped with fancy toys...

13:47.200 --> 13:49.400
..without risking my neck,...

13:49.560 --> 13:52.000
..that's a damn good compromise.

13:52.160 --> 13:56.560
- Fancy toys?
- Just gotta shoot 'em with a zat'n'ktel.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.040
OK. Found a flaw in your plan.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.160
What's that?

14:01.320 --> 14:05.400
Well, we're exactly one zat gun short
of actually having a zat gun.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.080
- A zat gun?
- Drop the "n'ktel".

14:10.360 --> 14:12.560
I guess it does save a bit of effort.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.200
(whirring)

14:26.840 --> 14:28.920
You're giving me a working zat gun?

14:29.080 --> 14:32.520
If it didn't work it wouldn't do you
any good. I'm trusting you.

14:37.360 --> 14:42.000
Jack, he disabled the DHD and Sam said
we can't fly that ship all the way home.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.120
So we'll fly it to a closer planet
with a Stargate.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.560
- Good thinking.
- It happens.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.600
Well, this is the place.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.280
Yeah. How do you open that door?

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
It opened when he said that word.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.840
Voice-activated. What was the word?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.920
Uh, "bark" something.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.560
Almond bark,
Barcalounger, Beetlejuice!

15:27.720 --> 15:30.000
"Barkna." It was "barkna".

15:32.320 --> 15:34.600
If it was "barkna"
the door would be opening.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.680
- This was your idea.
- You're the linguist.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.440
- I don't remember.
- Try!

15:39.480 --> 15:42.440
Well, I said "Can we talk about this?"
He said "Inside".

15:42.600 --> 15:45.720
I said "Inside what?" He said...?

15:45.880 --> 15:47.480
He said "Barokna"!

15:50.720 --> 15:52.640
(O'Neill) Gesundheit.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.680
OK, he opened the door
by pressing a combination of...

16:10.080 --> 16:11.920
- Teal'c?
- O'Neill?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.920
- How do you open this?
- The six symbols on the pad.

16:15.080 --> 16:18.360
You must enter
the correct combination of five.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.240
How many combinations could there be?

16:21.400 --> 16:23.200
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.640
Listen, in the meantime,
tell me how to fly this thing.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.720
(Teal'c)
First, locate the main steering console.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.080
(electronic voice)

16:33.240 --> 16:35.000
Daniel,...

16:35.160 --> 16:37.080
..would you come here a moment?

16:39.480 --> 16:41.400
What do you think this is?

16:42.960 --> 16:45.720
- Looks like a countdown.
- Of course it is!

16:47.760 --> 16:52.920
Oh, Teal'c, would these ships have
any kind of self-destruct mechanism?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.360
It is possible.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.920
- We just lost a digit.
- Of course we did.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.720
Oh, boy.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.760
So, Teal'c, how does one
override the self-destruct?

17:11.640 --> 17:14.359
Open the cowling in the centre console.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.440
There should be three delmacs.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.560
Crystals. There should be three crystals.

17:22.720 --> 17:26.560
- There's two. The middle one's missing.
- We're missing one!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.960
Then you cannot override
the self-destruct.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.880
- (electronic voice)
- Just lost another digit.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.840
- Aris must have the other crystal.
- Go.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
Hey! What were you guys thinking?

17:52.480 --> 17:54.400
Only I can fire that.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.840
- Put the weapon down.
- You put the crystal back.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.240
What if I don't?

18:04.400 --> 18:06.520
You won't blow up your ship.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.480
- Maybe I will.
- While you're in it?

18:17.360 --> 18:19.280
(electronic voice)

18:21.800 --> 18:23.000
(electronic voice)

18:29.640 --> 18:32.600
- Now it's set.
- Put the gun down.

18:32.760 --> 18:35.800
You think I'd give you a weapon
that would work on me?

18:41.040 --> 18:42.960
Ooh! Tickles!

18:47.240 --> 18:49.720
Then why did you pretend
to be knocked out?

18:49.880 --> 18:54.000
Well, let's just say I wanted
to see you guys sweat a little.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.800
Now, did we learn something here?

19:02.720 --> 19:04.240
Ouch!

19:10.920 --> 19:12.840
Let's go.

19:20.280 --> 19:23.520
I'm disappointed.
I thought we had something good going.

19:23.680 --> 19:29.040
- Oh, come on. What did you expect?
- I offered a fair deal. I trusted you.

19:29.200 --> 19:31.080
- Oh, please!
- (Daniel) We're sorry.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.040
Is the deal still on the table?

19:34.800 --> 19:38.560
- How could I trust you now?
- Look, your plan sucks.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.040
OK... we all go together this time.

19:45.360 --> 19:49.840
- You know, we're gonna need our stuff.
- Some of that shouldn't be a problem.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.960
(Daniel) So you don't have a problem
trading humans like commodities.

20:02.120 --> 20:05.600
You earthlings and your morality!
Has it ever occurred to you...

20:05.760 --> 20:09.280
..that outside your solar system
we might see things differently?

20:09.440 --> 20:12.320
(Carter)
Why don't the Goa'uld just kill you?

20:12.480 --> 20:17.160
Because I deliver. As long as I'm alive,
there'll always be a next time.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.760
- (Carter) Why not make you a host?
- They can't.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.280
They tried long ago
when they first came to my home planet.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.880
But there's something about my race's
makeup that rejects Goa'uld blending.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.600
- That's incredible.
- So incredible...

20:31.720 --> 20:34.640
..they wiped out
most of my people because of it.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.000
- But not you?
- I managed to impress them.

20:38.160 --> 20:40.600
My people are strong and skilled.

20:40.760 --> 20:45.360
That's why the Goa'uld kept
the youngest as slaves and killed the rest.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.120
You could have your freedom
on a planet where they can't find you.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.440
What freedom?
They killed my wife, but my son still lives.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.240
He's a slave
in one of Sokar's naqahdah mines.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.320
One day I hope to capture a prize...

20:57.480 --> 21:00.600
..valuable enough to trade
for his freedom and mine.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.840
Let's keep moving.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.920
Wow! These are cool.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.600
At the end of that riverbed
is the cave where I last saw Kel'tar.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.240
- You said he had some fancy toys?
- Yeah, at least a small hand device.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.320
Plus, when I approached, energy blasts
fired from several directions.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.200
OK. How about another zat?

21:48.320 --> 21:52.680
You shoot that Goa'uld first chance
you get. I'll stay here, set a shield trap.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.840
- I thought you'd want to watch us work.
- I trust you.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.680
- You do?
- Sure. And Major Carter stays with me.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.720
- Unacceptable.
- It's not negotiable.

22:05.880 --> 22:09.920
You don't return,
and I turn her over to Sokar.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.640
Yeah.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.040
So, Teal'c, how does one Goa'uld
fire weapons from several directions?

22:38.200 --> 22:41.200
- Tacs.
- Tac'n'ktels?

22:41.360 --> 22:44.000
Tacluchnatagamuntorons.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.120
Tacs.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.920
- What are they?
- Automatic remote weapons.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.560
- Heat-seeking?
- So it would seem.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.520
Surrender!

23:56.880 --> 23:58.640
Put your hand down!

23:58.800 --> 24:00.720
(coughs)

24:15.680 --> 24:18.000
You are Teal'c. The shol'va.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.120
Is that a host?

24:21.280 --> 24:23.840
You are SG-1 . From Earth.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.720
(O'Neill)
Yeah, apparently we're well known.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.480
My name is Korra.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.680
We were told it was Kel'tar.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.360
No.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.360
- Please help me.
- Help you?

24:39.520 --> 24:42.840
I am not Goa'uld. I am Tok'ra.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.320
(whirring)

24:52.160 --> 24:55.080
I don't have to tie you to a tree
or anything, do l?

24:55.280 --> 24:56.400
No.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.880
What is that?

25:01.880 --> 25:04.240
- Watching your friends.
- How?

25:05.320 --> 25:07.240
Magic.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.120
Naqahdah. The zat guns.
That's how you track the Goa'uld.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.880
You use their own technology
against them.

25:18.680 --> 25:22.640
The fact that you reject the Goa'uld
symbiote could be valuable to us.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.560
To all humans all over the galaxy. It could
be the key to defeating the Goa'uld.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.640
- I doubt it.
- If they couldn't use us as hosts...

25:32.640 --> 25:35.600
I told you before,
I don't understand this immunity.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.800
Well, we'd have to run some tests.

25:39.120 --> 25:43.560
You do not possess anything
of equal value worth trading for.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.440
Your son is being held as a slave.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.840
We can help you get him back.
Is that valuable enough?

26:02.440 --> 26:04.360
That's impossible.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.280
- His injuries are severe.
- What now?

26:20.000 --> 26:22.320
- Can you talk?
- Yes.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.200
All right. Here's what's happening.

26:34.120 --> 26:36.440
- There's a guy out there...
- Aris Boch.

26:38.160 --> 26:42.560
Yeah. He's got us trapped here and he's
holding a member of our team hostage.

26:42.720 --> 26:47.160
Samantha Carter, daughter of Jacob,
host to Selmak.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.880
So you've got good information.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.200
Here's the deal. He said if we can
catch you, he'd let us go home.

26:54.360 --> 26:57.400
I will not allow myself
to be turned over to Sokar.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.360
- Can you prove you're a Tok'ra?
- I only have my word.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.360
If Carter were here,
she would recognise me.

27:06.800 --> 27:12.360
Aris knows Sam can verify whether Korra,
Kel'tar, whoever, is telling the truth.

27:12.520 --> 27:17.200
As far as I'm concerned, you could be
a Goa'uld using the "I'm a Tok'ra" thing...

27:17.360 --> 27:19.280
..to get us to help you.

27:20.560 --> 27:23.160
- What did he say?
- That your name was Kel'tar...

27:23.320 --> 27:25.080
..and you were an enemy of Sokar.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.600
I was working in Sokar's ranks as a spy.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.440
I realised Sokar had learned
my true identity.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.200
I managed to escape
by stealing the cargo ship.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.960
It took me several weeks to travel here,...

27:36.120 --> 27:40.080
..the closest planet with a Stargate
not under Goa'uld control.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.680
Aris was already here guarding the gate.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.080
He had anticipated my plan.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.800
- Aris Boch claimed the vessel was his.
- It belongs to Sokar.

27:49.960 --> 27:55.480
And Aris likely plans to trade it
back to him, along with us. All of us.

28:02.080 --> 28:07.200
What's it like to have one of those things
bore itself in your brain and possess you?

28:08.200 --> 28:10.120
I couldn't tell you.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.680
Oh, come on. What are you saying?

28:13.320 --> 28:15.240
You wouldn't understand.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.040
- They're all the same - Tok'ra, Goa'uld...
- Is that really what you think?

28:20.200 --> 28:23.880
They all have different stories,
but the same bad blood.

28:24.040 --> 28:29.040
It's not true. If you really hate the Goa'uld,
you'd try to learn more about the Tok'ra.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.880
Well, I wasn't much good at school.

28:34.040 --> 28:37.160
Trying to defeat them
is better than the alternative.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.360
What? What is so funny?

28:41.520 --> 28:46.520
Oh, the whole thing is amusing when you
know just how insurmountable the task is.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.560
Defeating the Goa'uld.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.920
Yeah, oh, admirable!

28:51.080 --> 28:53.120
But amusing.

28:53.280 --> 28:57.320
If the right allies work together,
the task might not be so insurmountable.

28:57.480 --> 29:01.200
You mean me. Well, I couldn't help you
as much as you think.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.000
You mean you won't.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.200
You know what I think?

29:09.240 --> 29:11.120
I think you care.

29:11.280 --> 29:16.120
I don't think you like what you do
nearly as much as you pretend to.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.240
I think you should shut up.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.480
What is that?

29:40.080 --> 29:42.760
- Water.
- What you put in it.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.640
Flavour.

29:50.760 --> 29:53.720
- Aris told you about his wife and son?
- Oh, yeah.

29:53.880 --> 29:57.440
It's a lie. He has none. Never did.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.920
- So why does he do this?
- Greed.

30:01.080 --> 30:05.600
Not exactly. It is true that his race
cannot be used as hosts.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.920
And most were slaughtered
by the Goa'uld.

30:09.080 --> 30:13.800
Those that were kept alive were
addicted to a substance called roshna.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.520
- It was given to them in their water.
- That blue stuff?

30:18.280 --> 30:23.400
Now, after many generations, Aris Boch's
race cannot live without the roshna.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.080
They depend on it.
It keeps them subservient.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.240
If he stops taking the roshna, he will die.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.680
- So he has no choice?
- I do not defend him.

30:37.840 --> 30:42.320
Aris Boch has endeared himself
to the Goa'uld by being unscrupulous.

30:42.480 --> 30:45.200
He hunts both guilty and innocent,...

30:45.360 --> 30:48.200
..only caring whether
they have any trading value.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.480
Well, we have to get Carter
away from him.

30:52.640 --> 30:56.560
- Does this mean you believe me?
- Not just yet.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.240
But I've got that choiceless feeling again.

31:01.000 --> 31:05.000
I cannot be turned over to Sokar.
He has methods of extracting information.

31:05.160 --> 31:09.600
There are other Tok'ra operatives
in his midst who I will not betray.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.360
I understand.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.240
Can you walk?

31:21.360 --> 31:24.080
- I will not burden you.
- It is no burden.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.400
- You must leave your weapons.
- Why?

31:26.560 --> 31:30.080
Aris can track them. As long as
you carry Goa'uld technology...

31:30.240 --> 31:32.160
..he will know our position.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.440
Great.

31:49.560 --> 31:52.760
- What's wrong?
- I don't see them and they're not moving.

31:52.920 --> 31:55.840
Either the Goa'uld got them
or they're playing games.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.920
So what does that mean?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.360
It's a trap.

32:25.280 --> 32:27.200
- I will go.
- No, no.

32:28.960 --> 32:31.520
- I will.
- What are we supposed to do?

32:32.320 --> 32:35.360
Well, he's gonna have
to show himself eventually.

32:36.440 --> 32:38.640
Can you take him?

32:38.800 --> 32:40.720
I can.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.640
All right.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.240
Carter.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.680
Carter.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.280
Where is he?

33:09.440 --> 33:11.360
(rumbling)

33:46.600 --> 33:47.720
Carter.

33:50.480 --> 33:51.440
Cart...

33:51.840 --> 33:53.760
Carter! Come on.

33:55.320 --> 33:58.520
You passed out again. You all right?

33:59.840 --> 34:01.760
Yeah. What did I miss?

34:02.480 --> 34:04.400
Oh, not too much.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.520
Oh, by the way, the Goa'uld
Aris wanted us to catch,...

34:09.440 --> 34:13.199
..he claims to be a Tok'ra named Korra.
Ring a bell?

34:13.760 --> 34:16.920
- Yeah, it does.
- He said you'd recognise him.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.040
Maybe. We can't let Aris trade a Tok'ra.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.360
Oh, yeah!

34:26.520 --> 34:29.080
Way to play hard to get, boys.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.360
- Well, give me a little credit.
- Why's that?

34:32.520 --> 34:36.480
Well, I have what I wanted.
The rest of you, you're free to go.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.199
- You're keeping the bargain?
- I gave my word.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.840
You think you don't have a choice,
but there must be another way.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.360
If you take Korra, a lot of Tok'ra may die.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.880
I've already communicated with Sokar.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.360
A mother ship will enter orbit
around this planet any time now.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.480
I will not betray the lives of other Tok'ra.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.520
What the hell did you do that for?

35:12.520 --> 35:14.440
Poison?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.920
That's very un-Goa'uld-like.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.560
- Why would he do that?
- To save the lives of other Tok'ra.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.560
Since when does a Goa'uld
care about another Goa'uld?

35:30.720 --> 35:33.040
The Tok'ra are not the same.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.520
Sokar's on his way.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.240
Are you having second thoughts here?

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
I have to give him something.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.600
Take me.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.800
- Forget it.
- I'm the most valuable after the Tok'ra.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.880
I don't care.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.240
I will go.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.600
- Take me.
- (ringing)

36:04.240 --> 36:06.160
That'll be Sokar.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.320
OK. Brief moment of weakness.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.760
Teal'c comes with me.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.080
That just is not gonna happen.

36:21.240 --> 36:25.600
No other way. Last chance to take
that Tok'ra and get the hell out.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.880
You might need this.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.320
The missing piece of the DHD.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.720
Teal'c...

36:37.280 --> 36:38.960
We are choiceless.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.760
We'll find you.

36:41.920 --> 36:46.320
Oh, this is so beautiful. Really,
I'm starting to tear up here, you know?

36:46.480 --> 36:48.400
But we gotta go. Now.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.880
Here we go.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.320
What happened?

37:36.080 --> 37:38.000
Teal'c went in your place.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.160
Come on, let's get outta here.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.800
It's a pretty noble thing you're doing.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.960
You have made a sacrifice as well.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.760
I guess I never knew
the Tok'ra were different.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.760
So what made you betray Apophis?

38:09.320 --> 38:13.160
The Goa'uld are enslavers of worlds.
The humans value freedom.

38:13.320 --> 38:17.400
You don't really think the Tok'ra and
the humans could overthrow the Goa'uld?

38:17.920 --> 38:19.880
I do.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.480
I don't think so.

38:22.800 --> 38:27.920
I would rather serve with those
willing to die trying.

38:31.880 --> 38:36.600
I don't want to do this.
I hate the Goa'uld as much as you do.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.440
(explosions)

38:53.040 --> 38:55.240
Oh, my God.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.320
What the hell...?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.680
Escape pods.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.360
- Where's Teal'c?
- I am here, O'Neill.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.400
Yes!

39:18.560 --> 39:20.920
- You OK?
- I will be fine.

39:21.080 --> 39:24.040
- What happened?
- We had technical difficulties,...

39:24.200 --> 39:28.520
..which I communicated to Sokar's ship
just after I accidentally removed this.

39:34.240 --> 39:38.200
- Glad to have you back, Teal'c.
- I must find a way to pay tribute...

39:38.360 --> 39:41.040
..to what you have done for me
and the Tok'ra.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.880
There is no need.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.320
Hey, guys, what about me?

39:46.480 --> 39:49.440
- Don't I get a thank you?
- For doing the right thing?

39:50.520 --> 39:53.760
That's a backhanded show
of appreciation, but I'll take it.

39:53.920 --> 39:56.480
- Won't Sokar be angry?
- He'll think I'm dead.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.960
By the time he figures it out I'll be gone.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.840
- What about the substance you need?
- The roshna.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.680
There are plenty of Goa'uld out there
I could trade with.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.440
Well,...

40:10.840 --> 40:13.240
..we'd better get back to the Stargate.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.560
Oh, Dr Jackson,...

40:15.720 --> 40:20.040
..l was lying to you. The price on your
head is much more than a day's ration.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.040
The Goa'uld want to see you dead
as much as anyone...

40:23.200 --> 40:25.120
..for figuring out the Stargate.

40:26.560 --> 40:29.880
Thank you.
That doesn't make me feel any better.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.160
Major.

40:38.800 --> 40:43.600
Maybe someone will figure out a way
for my people to be free of the Goa'uld.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.240
And that would be something
worth trading for.
