00:14.970 --> 00:16.961
WOMAN: No!

00:18.010 --> 00:20.012
[women shrieking, men shouting]

00:23.630 --> 00:25.621
What is this, again?

00:27.670 --> 00:29.410
Roan

00:29.460 --> 00:30.939
Is it real?

00:30.980 --> 00:32.845
Oh, yeah.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.596
But the lion bit her.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.858
Yeah, there was,
like, 70 injuries

00:37.900 --> 00:39.504
during the making of this.

00:39.560 --> 00:40.811
No! [shrieking]

00:40.860 --> 00:42.031
That's Melanie Griffith
right there.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.332
She had to get 50 stitches.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.553
This is insane.
It's like a... a snuff film.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.341
You are weird.

00:54.310 --> 00:57.871
[phone ringing]

00:57.920 --> 00:59.876
Whose is that?

00:59.920 --> 01:02.002
Mine.

01:04.580 --> 01:08.107
So why were you
investigating me?

01:08.150 --> 01:11.108
Was I investigating you?

01:11.150 --> 01:14.768
24 hours of honesty.

01:14.810 --> 01:16.801
I didn't know what
I was getting Into.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.542
And what were you getting into?

01:21.600 --> 01:23.079
I don't know.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.645
You were a new boss,
you just stole an election.

01:25.690 --> 01:27.203
I didn't steal.

01:27.260 --> 01:29.296
I wanted to_make
sure you paId me.

01:29.350 --> 01:32.387
Really-- you thought
I wouldn't pay you?

01:32.440 --> 01:35.170
Hey, I been screwed over
by a lot of people.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.738
Like who?

01:39.790 --> 01:41.223
Hmm?

01:41.270 --> 01:43.261
Who screwed you over?

01:45.190 --> 01:48.227
Oh, people I used
to work with.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.840
What people?

01:52.630 --> 01:54.973
I'm not trying
to interrogate you.

01:55.020 --> 01:57.580
I'm just trying
to have a conversation.

01:57.630 --> 02:01.282
I talk, you talk.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.763
[grunts softly]

02:02.810 --> 02:05.506
Well, my best friend
screwed me over

02:05.560 --> 02:08.336
and borrowed a bunch of
money, never paid me back.

02:08.380 --> 02:10.029
Oh.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.548
I thought you were
gonna say a lover.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.602
No. Only money.

02:15.650 --> 02:17.641
Never been screwed
over In love.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.651
Oh, you feel
sorry for me now.

Nice robe.

02:33.890 --> 02:36.529
Thanks.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.802
So what's up
with your husband?

02:42.240 --> 02:45.152
My husband?
What do you mean?

02:45.200 --> 02:48.499
He wouldn't look askance
at me being here With you,

02:48.550 --> 02:50.768
eating pizza in
our underwear?

02:50.820 --> 02:52.776
[chuckles]

02:52.820 --> 02:54.811
Well, he might.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.739
But we have an arrangement.

02:57.780 --> 02:59.213
Really?

02:59.260 --> 03:01.694
How's that work?He needs me for his career.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.174
I need him for mine.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.912
What, that doesn't
meet with your approval?

03:11.230 --> 03:14.529
Ican read _
the non-verbal Jason Signs now.

03:15.890 --> 03:17.278
One eyebrow up:

03:17.320 --> 03:19.663
"Do you really mean that?"

03:19.720 --> 03:23.326
One eyebrow up with a smile:

03:23.370 --> 03:26.328
"That sounds a little
ridiculous, doesn't it?"

03:26.380 --> 03:28.803
Use your words, big man.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.851
[chuckles softly]

03:34.340 --> 03:36.592
[doorbell rings]

03:38.430 --> 03:40.386
What time is it?

03:40.430 --> 03:43.035
I don't know.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.819
Okay, let's just hide.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.303
They'll go away.

03:46.350 --> 03:48.306
[doorbell rings]

03:48.350 --> 03:50.306
VERONICA [muffled]:
Alicia, I know you're in there.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.305
We need to talk.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.999
What?

03:55.060 --> 03:57.096
That's my mother.

03:57.140 --> 03:58.755
Okay...

03:58.800 --> 04:01.268
Stay right here.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.584
Don't move. I mean that.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.757
[doorbell ringing]

04:05.810 --> 04:07.710
VERONICA: Alicia, open the door.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.194
I'm crying here.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.241
Are you
home?

04:13.680 --> 04:16.558
[doorbell rings]Will you answer me?

04:16.600 --> 04:19.296
What's wrong, Mom?

04:19.340 --> 04:20.898
I'm distraught.
What are...

04:20.950 --> 04:22.554
Were you sleeping?
It's 3:00 the afternoon.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.953
I know.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.342
I'm tired.

04:26.390 --> 04:27.869
It's Sunday.

04:27.910 --> 04:29.525
That's the day
I catch up on sleep.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.867
So let's talk later.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.138
No, this is for now.
What do you mean, later?

04:33.180 --> 04:35.831
Oh, I called your brother.
He's coming over too.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.998
What? Mom, no. No, this is about
both of your futures.

04:40.060 --> 04:42.620
I'm gonna be dead one day,
Alicia. Dead.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.319
Now, would you please
open this door...

04:44.370 --> 04:45.621
Whatthe hell
IS gonng on?

04:45.670 --> 04:46.887
Are you hiding something?

04:46.930 --> 04:49.273
No.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.888
I'm just sleeping.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.453
Well, this'll
take a minute.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.808
Okay, so call me.

04:53.850 --> 04:55.989
I did call you.
You weren't

04:56.030 --> 04:57.543
answering the phone.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.239
I was Madoffed.

05:01.990 --> 05:03.207
[door closes][sniffles]

05:03.250 --> 05:04.854
What's that chair there?

05:04.910 --> 05:06.207
I'm painting.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.511
What, really?

05:07.560 --> 05:09.289
[sniffs]
Doesn't smell like it.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.772
Then where were
you sleeping?

05:10.830 --> 05:12.604
Grace's room.Where's Grace?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.605
With Peter.
Uh, college for the weekend.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.604
Mom, let's talk tonight.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.139
Oh, I was robbed, Alicia.

05:17.180 --> 05:18.738
I met this financial advisor.

05:18.790 --> 05:20.963
He was a young guy. Uh,
he reminded me of Riclqn

05:21.010 --> 05:22.875
you know, the Dartmouth
guy you used to date?

05:22.930 --> 05:26.058
And he told me he
could double my money.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.317
Oh, God.Yeah, that's right,

05:27.370 --> 05:28.928
blame me. I'm the victim,

05:28.980 --> 05:31.141
so go ahead,
blame me.Okay, Mom, I will

05:31.200 --> 05:33.236
talk to someone at work.
Is the money all gone?

05:33.280 --> 05:34.542
Yes, every cent.

05:34.590 --> 05:36.546
Wait, Mom...Oh, come on, I just

05:36.590 --> 05:38.763
want to see
the color of the... Ooh.Mom, wait.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.245
Hi.JASON: Hi.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.814
This must be the painter.

05:43.860 --> 05:45.987
Can we do this
another time now,Mom?

05:46.040 --> 05:48.338
I will talk to David Lee
tomorrow and he'll get into it.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.164
Hi, I'm Veronica.

05:50.210 --> 05:53.384
Jason.Oh, Jason.
I don't think

05:53.440 --> 05:55.340
I know a Jason, do I?Mom. Please.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.779
I'm an investigator
at Alicia's work. Really?

05:57.830 --> 05:58.956
What's your last name?Okay, we're not having

05:59.010 --> 06:00.170
this conversation...Crouse.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.562
Crouse--
what kind of name...

06:01.620 --> 06:02.871
Is that German?English.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.228
Uh, but a bit of a mix, though.

06:04.270 --> 06:05.521
My Mom is Italian.

06:05.580 --> 06:06.706
Oh, God, the Italians.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.536
The color of Italian skin.

06:11.150 --> 06:12.401
And you, Mom...

06:12.450 --> 06:13.849
[doorbell rings]Oh, that must be Owen.

06:13.890 --> 06:15.846
Owen, we're in here.

06:15.890 --> 06:17.198
Oh, dear God.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.846
I brought bagels.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.765
Where is everybody?

06:22.810 --> 06:25.199
Owen, I know this is important,
but it's my day off.

06:25.250 --> 06:26.501
Can we do this tomorrow?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.596
Hey, I'm just
going where Mom told me.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.640
Stay.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.560
That's it. Okay, Mom, let's let
Jason alone for a few minutes.

06:39.610 --> 06:41.566
Up... Oh.Let's talk in the kitchen.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.613
Only if Jason promises
to come join us in the kitchen.[mouthing]

06:44.660 --> 06:46.093
Oh, I promise.

06:53.450 --> 06:55.623
Alicia has taken a lover.I haven't taken...

06:55.670 --> 06:57.399
What? Who is he?Jason.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.099
And investigator.
He's amazing.Good looking?

07:00.150 --> 07:01.845
Ooh, oh, my God.

07:01.890 --> 07:03.414
Finally she has someone
she deserves.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.542
Mom. Stop.I want to see.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.148
Let me see.No, seriously,

07:07.200 --> 07:09.464
both of you, stop.
This is my life.

07:09.510 --> 07:11.728
It is not a reality show.It's okay,
he's getting dressed.

07:11.770 --> 07:13.328
But he's coming out.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.462
What?Of the room,

07:15.520 --> 07:17.863
he's coming out of
the room. God, you have

07:17.910 --> 07:19.821
a one-track mind.Could you please both
go in the kitchen?

07:19.870 --> 07:21.121
Go. Go, go, go.[both muttering]

07:21.170 --> 07:22.785
Shh, stop.

07:22.830 --> 07:24.730
Mm-hmm.

07:24.790 --> 07:26.610
So... how'd you meet him?

07:26.660 --> 07:28.389
At work.
He's the investigator.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.488
Oh, my God,
that is so sultry,

07:30.530 --> 07:32.395
that is so essence
of New Orleans.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.613
Okay, Mom, so what happened
with your scam?

07:35.670 --> 07:38.184
Oh, I don't
want to talk about it.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.276
That's the only reason
we're here.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.709
Well, until about
four minutes ago.How much did you lose?

07:42.760 --> 07:45.285
I don't know. About $100,000.What? You said
$30,000.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.150
Well, look, I didn't
ask him to lose it.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.327
He was going to invest it.
And then I get...

07:49.380 --> 07:52.201
this letter.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.855
Gino Davidson?Yeah, yeah, what's...
I mean, what's

07:54.900 --> 07:57.073
wrong with that? You know,
it's very racist of you

07:57.120 --> 07:59.293
to think there's something
wrong with that name.I thought David Lee

07:59.340 --> 08:00.739
was investing for you.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.259
Did he connect you
with this guy?

08:02.300 --> 08:03.904
No, not really.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.349
[door opens]Hey.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.262
Hey.

08:09.310 --> 08:10.914
Didn't I say?

08:10.960 --> 08:13.838
Yeah, but I didn't know
how much to believe you.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.836
You know, he can
hear you, right?

08:15.880 --> 08:19.008
Jason, this is my family.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.925
My mother, Veronica,
and my brother, Owen.

08:20.970 --> 08:21.925
Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:21.970 --> 08:23.494
Hm.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.269
I should get going.
No!
No!

08:25.330 --> 08:27.457
Have a bagel.
We're hav-- we're having bagels.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.365
[doorbell rings]

08:29.420 --> 08:30.933
It is Sunday, right?

08:30.980 --> 08:33.323
Yes. Lot people
want to see you, Alicia.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.506
You're popular.Well, Jason

08:34.550 --> 08:35.630
has a very busy Sunday...

08:35.680 --> 08:36.681
Oh, no,
no, no, no,

08:36.730 --> 08:37.856
no, no. He's not leaving

08:37.900 --> 08:39.504
without a bagel,
are you? Come on.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.686
Sure.

08:40.730 --> 08:41.981
Go get your door,

08:42.040 --> 08:43.166
we'll be fine.

08:43.210 --> 08:46.031
[doorbell rings]

08:46.090 --> 08:49.389
We tried calling.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.659
It's Sunday.I know.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.042
This is Mike Tascioni.

08:54.090 --> 08:55.523
And this is Tom.

08:55.570 --> 08:56.878
Do you have a little water?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.649
VERONICA:
Who is it?

08:58.710 --> 09:00.189
It's not Peter,
is it?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.573
[laughs]
That would be awkward.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.099
What is your mother
doing here?

09:04.150 --> 09:05.139
Nice apartment.

09:05.190 --> 09:06.976
Thanks.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.885
Eli, can we do this--

09:08.930 --> 09:10.238
whatever this is--

09:10.280 --> 09:11.975
another time?I wish we could.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.419
Mike is Peter's new lavwer,

09:13.460 --> 09:14.631
and the grand jury
starts tomorrow.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.988
We think you'll be called.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.327
Did you get a subpoena?

09:17.380 --> 09:18.506
No.Well, you will.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.983
But we need
to ask a favor.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.725
We want the grand jurors
to see you there

09:21.770 --> 09:23.419
as they enter and leave.
It'll make a difference

09:23.470 --> 09:24.425
if they see your support.

09:24.470 --> 09:26.074
It'll humanize Peter.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.609
Who did your interior design?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.901
The colors are really good.

09:28.950 --> 09:32.249
Tascioni?
Are you...

09:32.310 --> 09:34.346
Elsbeth's
ex-husband.

Well, come on in.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.169
We have bagels.Really?

09:41.230 --> 09:43.050
Tom loves bagels.

09:43.100 --> 09:44.533
It's about the orgasm.

09:44.580 --> 09:46.093
Naomi Wolf called it
the goddess array.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.447
Thanks...

09:47.490 --> 09:48.752
Mom.

09:48.800 --> 09:50.108
You all right?

09:50.150 --> 09:52.015
I'm great.ELI: Oh, hey...

09:52.060 --> 09:53.322
Jason.JASON: Eli.

09:53.370 --> 09:54.621
Here we are again.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.632
So why isn't anybody at church?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.456
What do you mean?

10:00.510 --> 10:02.068
It's Sunday.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.337
We're all here.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.336
And not at church.

10:05.380 --> 10:08.201
That's a good point.I go
to church

10:08.250 --> 10:10.298
Sunday nights. Yeah.Really?

10:10.340 --> 10:13.218
Greek Orthodox. Why?Well, I would imagine that
would come as a surprise

10:13.260 --> 10:15.899
to my daughter.[doorbell rings]

10:15.960 --> 10:17.734
My money's on Peter.Not funny.

Alicia Florrick?

Would you believe no?

Good. Do I know you?

You don't. Connor Fox.
I'm from LA.

I'm prosecuting
your client.

11:04.570 --> 11:06.913
My client?
Governor Florrick?

11:06.970 --> 11:09.530
So you're admitting
you are prosecuting him.

11:09.580 --> 11:11.354
[chuckles] Well, I'm here
in a grand jury room

Hello. Mike Tascioni.

11:37.740 --> 11:38.809
Peter Florrick's lawyer.

Well, that's an...

Nice dog.

Thank you.
His name is Tom.

Is he a service dog?Yes.

11:50.230 --> 11:53.575
Good to know.

11:53.620 --> 11:56.532
So, what are we doing here?

Yes.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.791
Really?

12:01.850 --> 12:03.659
Yes, since you won't tell
us why you're targeting

12:03.720 --> 12:05.233
the governor, we're going
to question the witnesses

12:05.280 --> 12:06.235
as they leave.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.758
They won't talk to you.

of each Witness' questioning

you're bringing
as smoke screens and...

12:14.820 --> 12:17.425
which go to the
heart of the case.Mike, Mike, I don't think

12:17.470 --> 12:19.119
it's a good idea to...And why won't I just stretch
out the amount of time

12:19.170 --> 12:21.422
I question the smoke screens?Because you can't.

12:21.470 --> 12:24.257
Try stretching out ten minutes'
worth of questions to one hour.

Hi, Alicia. I'm here.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.340
We've already discussed
that Veronica made a mistake

13:14.180 --> 13:16.080
And I'm asking

13:16.140 --> 13:20.520
our investigator to step in to
look into this investor's scam.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.662
VERONICA:
Ooh, the investigator.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.792
Okay. I'll be right back.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.756
Hey, Mom?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.848
Did David just step out?Yes, he did.

13:30.890 --> 13:33.279
Owen's here.Owen? Why is Owen there?

13:33.330 --> 13:35.286
Uh, because I'm
supposedly good at math.

13:35.330 --> 13:36.672
Yes, everyone
blames me.

I don't want my...

13:41.820 --> 13:43.947
workmates to know
about my personal life,

13:43.990 --> 13:47.289
so can we not mention Jason
at my house?AIICIa,

13:47.340 --> 13:48.864

Oh, here-here he is now.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.428
Ah. This must be
our investigator.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.731
Hey, Jason.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.482
Hi.Alicia

13:59.530 --> 14:02.704
just, uh, told us
your name, Jason.
Wasn't that right, Alicia?

Yes.JASON:
Hello.

You've been the victim
of a pyramid scheme?

14:07.230 --> 14:08.538
Is that Alicia?Yes.

14:08.580 --> 14:09.751
We should talk to her now.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.052
Mmm. Alicia, do you mind?

14:12.110 --> 14:15.580
Uh, we have to talk to you
a minute about firm business.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.808
Okay.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.545
What are you doing?
Your office.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.591
No, your office.Diane will see us
in my office.

Yes. And that's what we want.

CARY:
Alicia,

14:30.130 --> 14:32.598
we're worried Diane is making
a power play for the firm.

14:32.650 --> 14:34.606
Yes, I've heard
about your concern, Cary,

14:34.650 --> 14:36.732
but I think it's just paranoia.DAVID:
Diane hasn't

14:36.780 --> 14:38.213
reached out to you
to join her?

14:38.260 --> 14:40.911
Join her in what?In an all-female partnership.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.269
Look, you're the one who
brought me into the firm, Cary.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.096
I'm a nonequity partner.
I don't mean anything.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.789
It's not about your position.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.614
It's about your connections
and your last name.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.570
We think that Diane
might try to use you

14:50.620 --> 14:52.576
as a |u_re to_
female-leaning clients.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.052
Are you hearing this from Diane?DAVID:
No.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.010
We're hearing it from clients.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.584
And

14:57.630 --> 14:58.585
you're not denying it.

14:58.630 --> 14:59.938
Then I'm denying it.

14:59.980 --> 15:01.800
Diane hasn't approached me.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.545
She's lying.

15:03.590 --> 15:05.114
Then what
do we do?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.718
Put her on the hot seat.

15:06.770 --> 15:10.160
Tell her if Diane approaches
her, she has to talk to us.

Okay,

15:24.090 --> 15:27.969

Okay, guys, uh,
I have to go. But, yes,

to my rsum?

15:53.300 --> 15:56.519

against a client.

a deal.

16:14.190 --> 16:15.578
I didn't make a deal.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.440
We're ready for you,
Ms. Eastman.

16:17.490 --> 16:20.493
You testify against Peter,
no one will ever hire you again

16:20.540 --> 16:21.882
and you know it.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.678
How can she hurt us?In ways

16:28.720 --> 16:30.278
I can't even imagine.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.115
MAN:
Who is it?

16:38.910 --> 16:41.640
Hey. I'm Gino.

16:41.690 --> 16:44.250
Should I know
what this is about?

16:44.300 --> 16:47.428
Does the name Veronica Loy
ring a bell?

16:47.480 --> 16:50.085
Oh, geez...

16:50.130 --> 16:53.042
I like Veronica.

16:53.090 --> 16:55.615
She always sat in the
front row of my class.What class?

16:55.660 --> 16:58.709
Fire Cycle. I teach Monday,
Wednesdays, and some Fridays

16:58.750 --> 17:00.877
to pay the rent,
while I day-trade and study up

17:00.930 --> 17:03.626
for my Series 7.So you day-traded away
Veronica's

17:03.670 --> 17:06.889
$100,000?No. Is that what
she told you?

17:06.930 --> 17:10.195
No. She told me you promised
to double her money.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.583
No way, man. I did
the opposite of promise her.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.585
I told her
it was a high risk investment.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.801
What was?I have a cousin
that got in early

17:16.860 --> 17:18.816
on riverboat casinos,
made a killing.

17:18.860 --> 17:21.727
So when he told me
he was gonna do a second round,

17:21.770 --> 17:23.078
I put a little of
my own money in.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.906
Risk capital.
Part of a...

17:24.950 --> 17:26.429
smart asset allocation.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.550
I mentioned it to Veronica.
She said she wanted in.

17:28.610 --> 17:31.078
But that didn't pan out?Let's just say
I'm not gonna

17:31.130 --> 17:33.735
be hanging up my bike shorts
anytime soon.

17:33.790 --> 17:38.227
I was very clear with Veronica
about what she was getting into.

17:38.270 --> 17:40.318
Look, I'm telling you the truth.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.579
Hey. I'm sorry you got saddled
with all of this.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.575
JASON: Uh, it's all right.
But this guy seems to be telling

17:48.630 --> 17:50.234
the truth. He's an idiot

17:50.280 --> 17:52.805
but not necessarily a con man.So you're asking

17:52.850 --> 17:56.149
if my mother is dumb enough
to give $100,000 to an idiot?

17:56.200 --> 17:58.418
Not dumb enough. Just whether...

17:58.460 --> 18:00.803
Yes, well, she is.All right, well,

18:00.860 --> 18:03.374
I-I don't really think
there's an issue here then.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.818
It's not a Madoff situation.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.987
It's just a bad investment.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.769
Okay. I'll talk to my mom.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.299
No, don't worry about it.
You know what,

18:10.350 --> 18:12.773
I got to tell David Lee,
so I'll talk to her.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.048
How are you doing, by the way?Good.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.694
Wait, which subject?

18:16.740 --> 18:19.083
Our lost weekend.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.482
Good.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.486
I needed to clear my head.

18:22.530 --> 18:24.748
And we didn't even drink.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.394
We didn't.

18:26.450 --> 18:29.010
Sex is a good replacement
for tequila.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.573
[chuckles]
It can be.

18:30.630 --> 18:32.313
I wish you were here right now.

18:32.370 --> 18:33.758
Where's "here"?

18:33.800 --> 18:36.268
Handicapped bathroom
in the federal building.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.890
[chuckles]
You know, I think
I wrote a Penthouseletter

18:38.940 --> 18:40.498
about something like that.[chuckles]

18:40.550 --> 18:43.189
Okay. I'd better go. Take care.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.241
FOX:
An example
of what you mean by that.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.110
RUTH:
They're not clean and pure.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.163
_FOX: _
No one is suggesting
Governor Florrick is pure.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.768
RUTH:
I did my due diligence

18:51.820 --> 18:53.253
before joining.
That wasn't surprising.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.518
FOX:
Perhaps not to you.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.608
A grand jury might be
surprised to learn

18:57.650 --> 18:59.208
some of these things
about Governor Florrick.

18:59.260 --> 19:01.216
RUTH:
What things
about Governor Florrick?

19:01.270 --> 19:04.694

Let's turn to the events
of November. You were...

19:05.700 --> 19:08.134
[indistinct chatter]

19:14.670 --> 19:16.274
Uh,

19:16.320 --> 19:17.662
I...

19:17.720 --> 19:19.494
Eli, can I talk to
you for a minute?

19:19.540 --> 19:21.542
Sure.Do you mind?

19:24.770 --> 19:27.546
I'm a lawyer. And
Mike is a lawyer.Mmm. Mmm.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.718
I can't get too
involved in... this.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.943
Wh-What is this?

19:35.040 --> 19:38.032
Uh... Alicia...

19:41.870 --> 19:44.043
Alicia, this is...Shut up.

19:44.090 --> 19:45.648
[indistinct voices]

19:45.700 --> 19:47.042
RUTH:
I think bringing me in

19:47.090 --> 19:48.523
implies something
very smart about...

19:48.570 --> 19:50.356
Is this the grand jury?I can't say anything.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.709
I'm a lawyer,
and I've been subpoenaed.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.059
But I am hearing
the grand jury room?You found this

19:55.100 --> 19:57.364
on your own. It's not illegal
for you to listen.

19:57.410 --> 19:58.752
It is illegal for me.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.665
Oh, my God, you're great.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.584
Good-bye.

20:04.980 --> 20:07.369
[indistinct chatter of Fox]

20:07.420 --> 20:09.115
RUTH:
Eli Gold, bless his heart...

20:09.160 --> 20:11.378
[indistinct,
overlapping chatter]

20:11.420 --> 20:15.242
MAN:
...now is the time
to put it in the...

20:15.300 --> 20:17.074
MAN 2:
No, no, can't.

20:17.120 --> 20:18.769
All right, so put it
over there, huh?

20:18.820 --> 20:20.253
Yeah, we got a lot
of work to do.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.733
How many of these things
do we got to do...?

20:21.780 --> 20:23.771
We got to fix that...

20:23.830 --> 20:26.867
FOX: ...might have acquired
a quick infusion of cash.RUTH: He did.

20:26.920 --> 20:29.081
And did Lloyd Garber
provide that money?

20:29.140 --> 20:30.869
He bundled it
for us, yes.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.525
And you had struggles
with Eli Gold, too, didn't you?

20:33.580 --> 20:36.481
Eli Gold had
some issues with me

20:36.530 --> 20:38.839
because I replaced him
as campaign manager.

20:38.880 --> 20:40.962
Well, let's talk about
Eli Gold for a second.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.074
RUTH:
Cand_idat_es don't come into
your life like newborn babies.

20:56.120 --> 20:59.248
They're not clean and pure.
Certainly not Peter Florrick.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.597
FOX:
My question was

21:01.690 --> 21:03.169
RUTH:
Every candidate

21:03.210 --> 21:05.428
gets asked favors.
Comes with the territory.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.735
But I never saw or heard
Governor Florrick cross a line.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.042
[indistinct chatter]

21:12.090 --> 21:15.264
[sighs]

21:23.970 --> 21:25.665
Good Lord.

21:25.710 --> 21:26.790
FOX:
Thank you, Ms. Eastman.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.410
Let's turn
to the question of donuts.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.109
RUTH:
Okay. Which one?

21:31.150 --> 21:32.708
Lloyd Garber. He was one

21:32.760 --> 21:34.375
of Governor Florrick's
top donors, yes?

21:34.420 --> 21:36.149
RUTH:
Yes, that is true.

21:36.200 --> 21:38.805
FOX:
In fact, wasn't Lloyd Garber
the single largest donor

21:38.860 --> 21:40.202
to Governor Florrick's
preSIdential campaign?

21:40.250 --> 21:42.559
Yes, he donated money,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.034
organized fund-raisers.And they had

21:45.080 --> 21:46.866
conversations
you weren't privy to?

21:46.910 --> 21:49.219
Of course. Donors
on that level

21:49.260 --> 21:51.387
get a lot of access.

21:51.440 --> 21:54.125
FOX:
Did Governor Florrick ever
mention a falling out or

21:54.180 --> 21:55.863
a period of friction?

21:55.920 --> 21:58.081
With Mr. Garber? No.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.131
Did Mr. GarbNer mention it?
o.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.704
Just to be clear,

22:01.750 --> 22:04.969
he never mentioned
any trouble in 2012?

22:05.010 --> 22:07.149
RUTH:
I never heard of any.

22:07.190 --> 22:08.703
FOX:
He didn't mention Peter

22:08.760 --> 22:11.365
prosecuting
his illegitimate...

22:11.410 --> 22:13.719
That would be no. I don't know
anything about that.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.887
Uh-huh. But you would
expect that situation

22:15.940 --> 22:18.898
to drive a wedge between Mr.
Garber and Governor Florrick.

22:18.940 --> 22:20.851
RUTH:
He wasn't Governor Florrick
at that time.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.720
FOX:
Yes, of course.
State's Attorney Florrick.

22:22.770 --> 22:25.375
You would expect support
to be cut off...[knocking]

22:25.430 --> 22:26.988
but it wasn't.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.998
In fact, Mr. Garber started
bundling even larger amounts.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.553
[knocking,
indistinct chatter continues]

22:31.610 --> 22:34.340
It's occupied!
Try the next one!

22:35.570 --> 22:37.959
Oh.[loud knocking]

22:40.440 --> 22:42.874
[scoffs]

22:42.920 --> 22:45.309
Damn it!

22:46.620 --> 22:48.872
[high-pitched whirring
of wheelchair]

22:48.930 --> 22:51.319
[crowd chatter]

22:53.150 --> 22:54.538
Okay, I have
something to tell you,

22:54.590 --> 22:56.364
and I can't tell you
how I know it.
Why?

22:56.410 --> 22:58.275
I just can't.
Why?
Mike!

22:58.330 --> 23:02.152
You're both lawyers, I'm not,
but it is my understanding

23:02.200 --> 23:04.191
that what they're discussing
in that room

23:04.250 --> 23:06.593
is an event
that took place in 2012.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.596
That's very specific.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.949
What event in 2012?I'm not sure,
but I know

23:10.990 --> 23:12.594
it has to do with Lloyd Garber.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.424
So we think this is about

23:14.480 --> 23:16.550
corrupt fund-raising practices?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.389
Yes.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.136
Is there anything there?I don't know.

23:25.180 --> 23:28.138
I know what I did. I...
don't know what Peter did.

23:28.180 --> 23:29.966
Mrs. Florrick?

23:30.010 --> 23:32.228
I don't know.
You'd have to talk to Peter.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.364
And we have no hint as to what
this event is in 2012?

23:36.410 --> 23:38.492
[wheelchair whirring]ALICIA:
Well, maybe you can

23:38.540 --> 23:40.144
go and find out more, Eli.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.715
Oh, right. Uh, yes.

23:51.690 --> 23:54.375
Think there's something here
that I don't want to know about?

23:54.430 --> 23:56.990
I think you might be right.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.474
Is it illegal or unethical?

23:59.520 --> 24:01.693
I... don't know anymore.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.389
ROLAND:
Mrs. Florrick.

24:03.440 --> 24:07.171
Oh, Mister...
Is it still "Hlavin?"

24:07.220 --> 24:09.484
Sure. Just to keep
things easy.
Mr. Hlavin.

24:09.530 --> 24:12.135
And are we admitting
we're an FBI agent today?

24:12.180 --> 24:13.704
Why not?
Mr. Tascioni,

24:13.750 --> 24:16.184
this is Roland Hlavin.
He's an FBI agent

24:16.230 --> 24:17.572
who keeps things
interesting.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.404
Nice to meet you.

24:19.450 --> 24:20.712
I guess you're the next witness.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.660
I think I am.
And

24:22.720 --> 24:23.880
do you know
what this is all about?

24:23.940 --> 24:25.976
I think it's a grand jury
investigation.

24:26.020 --> 24:28.284
And it's focusing on 2012?

24:29.770 --> 24:31.761
What?

24:31.810 --> 24:35.894
2012. That's what
this is about, right?

24:35.950 --> 24:39.295
What are you talking about?

24:39.340 --> 24:41.558
The events in 2012
with Lloyd Garber.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.384
It was completely innocent.

24:43.430 --> 24:47.127
Who told you this has anything
to do with 2012?

24:47.180 --> 24:48.568
Where'd you hear that?
Did Connor say something?

24:48.610 --> 24:50.009
He did.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.654
And you should tell him
that we're prepared

24:51.700 --> 24:53.179
to show that this
is a witch hunt?

24:53.230 --> 24:55.528
Even the payoff?

24:55.580 --> 24:57.707
Yes, even the payoff.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.923
Okay, great.
Bring your worst.

24:59.970 --> 25:01.756
Nice to meet you.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.976
Nicely done.

25:11.030 --> 25:12.895
Is there a payoff?

25:12.940 --> 25:14.635
I have no idea.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.728
You'll need to_ refute
it in your testimony.

25:16.770 --> 25:18.203
[door opens]

25:26.350 --> 25:28.602
What is Eli doing?

25:28.650 --> 25:30.789
We have to get
an investigator on this.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.219
That would be good. Do
you have someone in mind?

25:35.960 --> 25:38.485
Unfortunately,
you weren't cheated, Veronica.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.657
Says him.
Yes, but also,

25:40.710 --> 25:42.610
those papers
that you signed.But if I was cheated,

25:42.670 --> 25:44.012
those papers shouldn't count.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.493
You weren't
cheated, Mom.
I was.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.360
I mean, they make
the print so small,

25:47.410 --> 25:48.923
and they trick you
with the language.

25:48.980 --> 25:50.368
And I mean,
who reads all that?

25:50.410 --> 25:52.014
_ You invested_
in a riverboat casmo?

25:52.070 --> 25:54.322
VERONICA:
He said that the only person

25:54.370 --> 25:56.372
who comes out ahead
in gambling

25:56.420 --> 25:58.376
is the house.

26:00.770 --> 26:02.681
You don't believe me, do you?

26:02.730 --> 26:05.949
But he cheated me.This is just like
that last time, Mom.

26:05.990 --> 26:09.073
That guy who got you to give
him your Social Security number?

26:09.130 --> 26:10.609
He said you were in trouble.

26:10.650 --> 26:12.254
I couldn't get a hold of you.

26:12.300 --> 26:13.915
So the money's gone?

26:13.960 --> 26:16.827
Well, pretty much. You still
have some investment money.

26:16.870 --> 26:19.009
Not enough to pay
off Mom's mortgage?
We'll see.

26:19.050 --> 26:20.608
VERONICA:
I did nothing wrong here.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.480
I was cheated.

26:25.230 --> 26:27.448
This other guy that got
her Social Security number--

26:27.490 --> 26:28.889
when was that?

26:28.930 --> 26:30.272
OWEN:
Last year.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.878
We worked it out.
He never got any money.

26:31.930 --> 26:34.148
Do you remember
the month?
Why?

26:34.200 --> 26:36.760
I need to check out something.

26:36.810 --> 26:38.584
Is it something
that will get her money back?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.028
I don't know.

26:40.070 --> 26:41.890
February? Around my birthday.

26:43.730 --> 26:46.153
[elevator bell dings]

26:46.210 --> 26:47.552
Hey.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.989
Hi. I was just coming
to talk to you.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.031
Where you going?To find your mother.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.548
Okay, not
what I expected.

26:54.610 --> 26:56.828
Do you have a minute?
Yeah.

27:01.830 --> 27:07.052
Would you be offended if I said
I want to take you right now?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.099
No.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.054
So, anyway,

27:16.110 --> 27:18.977
um, are you
still freelance?

27:19.020 --> 27:21.068
I am. What do you need?

27:21.110 --> 27:23.158
It's not for me.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.588
[laughs]

27:24.640 --> 27:26.414
I hope
this isn't too weird for you.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.075
It's for your husband.

27:29.120 --> 27:30.985
How did you know?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.076
That look on your face.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.079
Well, we think this grand jury
investigation is about something

27:37.130 --> 27:40.213
that happened in 2012
involving Lloyd Garber.

27:40.260 --> 27:41.989
That's all we know.

27:42.050 --> 27:43.608
Can you find out more?

27:43.660 --> 27:45.002
I can try.

27:45.050 --> 27:47.268
And this is okay with you?

27:47.310 --> 27:49.835
It's just work.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.928
Hey, and what's going on
with my mom?

27:51.970 --> 27:54.188
I thought that was over.It was.

27:54.230 --> 27:57.188
But I just found out
she's on the sucker's list.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.198
It's a list of people
that have fallen for scams.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.935
Con men trade and sell them.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.459
So, she was cheated?

28:03.500 --> 28:05.365
It's possible,

28:05.420 --> 28:07.502
but the con man
covered his tracks,

28:07.550 --> 28:10.155
so, we have to create new ones.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.939
Hmm.

28:11.990 --> 28:15.039
Uh.

28:29.220 --> 28:31.609
Here, let me help you.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.660
Oh, God.

28:39.710 --> 28:42.668
[indistinct chatter
through vent]

28:42.720 --> 28:44.585
FOX:
Okay, I'd like to turn...

28:44.630 --> 28:46.803
Strike that.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.408
Was there a task force in place

28:48.460 --> 28:50.678
to investigate
Governor Florrick?No. This began

28:50.720 --> 28:52.324
as an investigation
into corruption

28:52.380 --> 28:53.540
in the Cook County judiciary.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.988
Well, without compromising

28:55.030 --> 28:56.816
your other investigation,

28:56.860 --> 28:59.078
tell us what turned your
attention to Governor Florrick.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.032
ROLAND:
Well, it started as a chance
comment by an informant.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.479
And what was that?

29:03.520 --> 29:05.420
We were working
undercover at the time

29:05.480 --> 29:07.516
when a judge we had turned
told us about a case...

29:07.570 --> 29:09.049
MAN:
Hey, what are they doing
with the drwNall here?

29:09.090 --> 29:10.523
MAN 2:
What'd you say?

29:10.570 --> 29:12.344
MAN:
What are they doing
with the drwNall here?

29:12.400 --> 29:14.174
MAN 2:
I don't know. They haven't said
anything about it.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.561
MAN:
What do we do?

29:15.620 --> 29:17.485
Just leave it?
I would.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.259
They always get pissed
if we think for ourselves.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.572
[chuckles]
I know, but
check this out.

29:21.620 --> 29:24.145
And in this context,
what does "certain" mean?

ROLAND:
Well, you can't just go
on the testimony of

29:27.800 --> 29:29.062
one guy
you've already rolled up.

29:29.110 --> 29:30.805
What about this?
Huh? What about this?

29:30.850 --> 29:32.283
Hey, hold on a second!

29:32.330 --> 29:34.195
Hold on a second!Oh, come on. Come on!

29:34.250 --> 29:35.672
MAN 2:
Wait. What?

29:35.730 --> 29:37.413
MAN:
I'm not sure
if this is the right wall.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.335
Are we on the right wall here? V-Lock.

29:39.380 --> 29:41.428
MAN:
He's gonna take
another ten hours...

29:41.470 --> 29:44.121
FOX:
Are you certain that was
a result of corruption?

29:44.170 --> 29:45.819
Go_vernor Fl_orrick
committed a crime then?

29:45.870 --> 29:48.828
ROLAND:
Yes. It's extremely unlikely

29:48.870 --> 29:51.646
it was a coincidence.
That's not how politics works,

29:51.700 --> 29:53.304
not how Chicago works.MAN:
No, no.

Yeah.

29:59.050 --> 30:01.484
[low, indistinct conversations]

30:07.540 --> 30:09.269
[quietly]:
It's about V-Lock.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.719
V...?

30:10.760 --> 30:13.228
Lock. This investigation
is about V-Lock.

30:13.280 --> 30:14.713
What's V-Lock?

30:14.760 --> 30:16.933
I have no idea.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.069
Sorry, I wish I could help,
but just don't know how.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.428
Give my mom
her money back.

30:26.470 --> 30:28.461
I lost $80,000 myself.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.908
It was everything that I saved.

30:29.950 --> 30:31.292
You lost her $100,000.

30:31.350 --> 30:32.738
It wasn't even hers to invest.

30:32.780 --> 30:34.122
Owen, he already told me.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.386
Mom, I don't care
what he told you...

30:35.440 --> 30:36.520
GINO:
It was a risky investment.

30:36.570 --> 30:38.219
I told her.Owen, I told you.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.919
This isn't going to work.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.439
We'll just invest it
somewhere else.

30:41.490 --> 30:42.912
All right, fine,
we'll call him.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.999
Wait, invest what
somewhere else?

30:47.060 --> 30:48.880
Oh. Oh, that's all right.

30:48.930 --> 30:51.148
It's just that we need
a more certain investment.

30:51.190 --> 30:52.839
I_ha_ve more
certain investments.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.881
Veronica, I told you,
this was one of the riskiest,

30:54.940 --> 30:56.407
with the highest yield.

30:56.460 --> 30:58.587
Yeah, but since she
lost half her savings,

30:58.630 --> 31:00.370
she needs a
higher yield.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.456
Wait, so how much do you have
to invest?

31:02.510 --> 31:03.761
My husband's pension.

31:03.810 --> 31:05.289
$90,000.

31:05.340 --> 31:09.071
OWEN:
But we need a
certain investment.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.429
I have some options.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.779
Listen...

31:13.820 --> 31:14.866
How'd it go?

31:14.910 --> 31:16.468
I think I was _
pretty damn convmcmg.

Oh.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.099
Hello?

31:26.140 --> 31:27.391
Hey, Alicia.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.929
Oh, tell her
what we did.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.267
Actually, we have
another issue.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.049
We think this grand jury
investigation

31:32.100 --> 31:34.148
might have something
to do with V-Lock.

31:34.190 --> 31:35.794
V-what?
What is that?

31:35.850 --> 31:37.750
ALICIA:
V-Lock. We don't know
what it is.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.062
How was it used?

31:39.110 --> 31:40.930
I don't know.
Just the issue is V-Lock.

31:40.980 --> 31:47.499
What about
State of Illinois v. Lock.

31:47.550 --> 31:50.280
That sounds interesting.

31:50.340 --> 31:53.514
We need to look into if
there is a People v. Lock.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.948
All right,

31:55.000 --> 31:56.331
I'm on it.

31:56.390 --> 31:57.641
Aren't you going to tell her
what we did?

31:57.690 --> 31:58.907
We kicked ass, Alicia.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.086
[Owen and Veronica laughing]

32:00.130 --> 32:01.347
I'm so glad.

32:01.390 --> 32:02.607

32:03.830 --> 32:05.695
Do you have a minute, Alicia?

32:05.740 --> 32:08.129
Sure.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.573
[quiet music plays,

32:14.280 --> 32:17.920
Uh, it's been a bit of
a ride, hasn't it?

32:21.150 --> 32:24.540
I know we've had
some tense moments, but...

32:24.590 --> 32:27.058
I'm very glad you're back home.

32:27.110 --> 32:29.066
I am, too.
Good.

32:29.120 --> 32:31.372
Things are finally
settling down.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.370
Cary thinks you want
to take over the firm

32:36.430 --> 32:37.681
with female partners.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.942
Is that true?

32:42.170 --> 32:43.899
No.

32:43.960 --> 32:46.178
A year ago you asked me,

32:46.220 --> 32:49.041
"Why not make it
an all-female firm?"

32:49.090 --> 32:51.524
I know.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.741
But you've changed your mind?

32:54.790 --> 32:56.439
I have become, uh,

32:56.490 --> 32:58.355
more temperate.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.108
But what is it that you want?

33:02.150 --> 33:03.799
I want to be of use.

33:03.850 --> 33:06.193
No, you don't, Alicia.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.196
I've watched you
over the years.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.549
You hide your ambition
under a bushel,

33:10.590 --> 33:13.593
but it is a very bright lamp.

33:15.770 --> 33:19.035
I was very happy on my own.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.980
I'm very happy here.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.861
You may be suspicious
of me,

33:23.910 --> 33:25.298
but all I want is to be of use.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.739
I'm not suspicious
of you.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.522
I want to join forces with you.

33:30.570 --> 33:33.562
Uh, could you give
us a minute?

33:35.620 --> 33:38.316
I've been working with Cary now
as a fellow name-partner

33:38.360 --> 33:40.009
for a year.

33:40.060 --> 33:44.053
He's learned a lot,
I respect him a great deal,

33:44.100 --> 33:46.443
but he is no Will Gardner.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.405
He doesn't pretend to be.

33:50.460 --> 33:55.159
You don't either,
but you fill his shoes.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.929
You can slice an
opponent to shreds,

33:56.990 --> 33:58.332
smiling the whole time,

33:58.380 --> 34:00.462
and they come back,
thanking you.

34:00.510 --> 34:04.241
I want someone I can
work across from who...

34:04.300 --> 34:08.122
who I can respect,
who I think can outrace me.

34:09.350 --> 34:12.080
Cary is not that person.

34:12.130 --> 34:16.829
And anyone who's not that person
is holding us back.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.096
So you're a woman,

34:21.140 --> 34:23.358
I'm a woman.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.482
What are you proposing?

34:25.540 --> 34:28.316
I'm proposing that we work
together, that's all.

34:29.540 --> 34:31.360
To push Cary out?

34:31.410 --> 34:34.140
To buy him out...
eventually.

34:35.330 --> 34:37.457
This is not about
a take over.

34:37.510 --> 34:41.025
This is a way to sharpen
our advantage.

34:41.070 --> 34:44.198
There will be a winnowing among
law firms in Chicago.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.115
It's happening already.

34:46.170 --> 34:49.071
We need to make ourselves
even more relevant.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.348
You and I can do that.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.179
What do you say?

34:56.390 --> 34:58.824
Shall we eat?

35:08.580 --> 35:10.445
I need a word.

35:11.710 --> 35:12.927
Yes.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.728
Who was Richard Locke?

35:25.770 --> 35:27.590
The People v. Locke.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.073
You were the prosecutor.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.111
I was on the team,
but I rode the bench.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.592
Matan was lead. Why?

35:32.650 --> 35:33.992
Was it a murder trial?

35:34.040 --> 35:35.940
Yeah. The kid,
Richard Locke,

35:36.000 --> 35:37.513
was accused of murdering
his girlfriend's ex.

35:37.570 --> 35:38.901
He claimed it
was an aCCIdent.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.382
Was it?

35:40.440 --> 35:42.601
Unclear. The case ended
in a mistrial. Why?

35:42.660 --> 35:45.220
Was there anything unusual
about the case?

35:45.270 --> 35:47.170
[sighs]

35:47.230 --> 35:50.745
Well, the defendant, Locke,
was young, working class,

35:50.800 --> 35:53.098
but he had
an amazing defense team.

35:53.150 --> 35:54.538
Who paid for that?

35:54.580 --> 35:55.922
We didn't do a source of funds,

35:55.970 --> 35:57.756
but there was a rumor
that his father

35:57.800 --> 35:59.358
was someone who mattered.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.843
Are you going to tell me
what this is about?

36:04.900 --> 36:07.505
Is there any chance
his father was...?

36:07.550 --> 36:09.677
No, we have to stop talking.

36:09.730 --> 36:12.335
You'll be subpoenaed
about what I just asked,

36:12.380 --> 36:14.200
and I will be
about what you said,

36:14.250 --> 36:15.251
so I am ending this.

36:33.710 --> 36:35.962
Oh, hey, I'm heading out.
What's up?

36:36.010 --> 36:37.796
Sorry, I gotta rush off.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.013
I'd love to talk.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.382
That's illegal-- Illinois
is a two party state.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.954
You can't use that
in a court of law.

37:06.000 --> 37:10.039
I don't plan on using it
in a court of law.

37:12.010 --> 37:14.433
Then how do you
plan on using it?

37:15.880 --> 37:18.098
That depends on where
Veronica's money is.

37:24.020 --> 37:25.499

Pretty much.

37:28.590 --> 37:30.808
Diane thinks the firm
needs to be defined.

37:30.850 --> 37:32.454
It needs an identity.

37:32.510 --> 37:33.932
She's not wrong.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.242
All-service firms
tend to do too much.

they're about.

an all-women firm?

37:41.080 --> 37:43.685

37:43.730 --> 37:45.288

what they're buying into

I know, but what do you think?

37:53.350 --> 37:54.305
Do we get paid more money?

37:54.350 --> 37:56.523
I would.
Oh, great.

you were going to add a "but."

think I should do?

Or...
