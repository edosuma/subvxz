for brain function
in the O.R.,

wake him up and do
a traditional neuro exam.

he would say
that I was weird,

I just told him
how beautiful he was.

We were having

and I guess Ethan
didn't like that idea,

24:15.722 --> 24:23.029
so I gave birth

no severe compression on MCA,
no new bleeds.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.427

No, I wasn't wrong.

25:24.924 --> 25:28.294
it's just new
to this location,

25:28.427 --> 25:31.297
which means it's moving.

25:31.430 --> 25:32.832
And based
on its trajectory,

25:32.965 --> 25:35.401
it's gonna cause
a lot more damage.

25:36.669 --> 25:39.205

We can't go through the
water drainage system
of the boy's brain

because that would mean
having to puncture

25:56.522 --> 25:58.024
the ventricular wall
at the thalamus,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.326
and we can't follow the injury
pathway using MRI guidance

26:00.459 --> 26:01.728
because the metal
in the bullet
rules out the MRI.

Shaun,
every parent has one job,

27:06.592 --> 27:09.461
and that's to keep
their kid alive,

27:09.595 --> 27:12.932
to keep them from
all the horrors in the world.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.067

27:16.836 --> 27:19.138

protect Ethan,

27:19.271 --> 27:21.140

so much.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.313

Wouldn't let us wash it.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.720

on it.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.158

28:49.361 --> 28:51.463

a little like this

grape juice 10 years earlier?

29:15.621 --> 29:18.024

How many?

29:48.254 --> 29:50.022
Where's the line?

29:50.156 --> 29:52.424
Every vote

29:52.558 --> 29:54.760
We support the things
we think are important,

29:54.894 --> 29:58.764
and...rationalize
the things that aren't.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.934
Unfortunately, compromise
has become a dirty word,

30:02.068 --> 30:04.270
which is ironic since
that's the essence
of democracy,

30:04.403 --> 30:07.239

31:07.433 --> 31:11.170
We weren't wrong about leaving
the other fragment in.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.906
So you weren't incompetent
about that,

31:14.040 --> 31:17.509
just about completely missing
this other fragment?

31:17.643 --> 31:18.978
Yes.

31:20.346 --> 31:24.516
But the new fragment
isn't stable,

31:24.650 --> 31:29.021
and will almost definitely
continue to cause damage.

31:29.155 --> 31:31.190
So you'll remove it
as soon as possible.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.495
It's too deep to remove.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.898
