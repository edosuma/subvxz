WEBVTT

00:57.145 --> 01:02.333
The time is now 10:41,
19 minutes before countdown.

01:02.433 --> 01:05.007
19 minutes.

03:07.683 --> 03:09.875
- Yes? Yeah.
- Jeannie?

03:09.975 --> 03:14.000
This is Pete. See if you can find
someone to take a story for me.

03:14.100 --> 03:15.416
My typewriter's seized up.

03:15.516 --> 03:17.125
- I'll try.
- You all right?

03:17.225 --> 03:18.458
Yeah, so far.

03:18.558 --> 03:21.382
You better come up here, Jeannie.
No sense of being on your own.

03:21.725 --> 03:24.116
Pete, how long before we know...

03:24.516 --> 03:27.291
- Copy desk? Hold, I'm giving you newsroom.
- Yes?

03:27.391 --> 03:30.166
- Look, Kitty, do me a favour.
- Are you ready?

03:30.266 --> 03:32.666
- Who's there?
- Pete Stenning. I can't write.

03:32.766 --> 03:33.926
Now, will you take it for me?

03:33.933 --> 03:36.416
But for what? Who says
there's gonna be an edition?

03:36.516 --> 03:38.299
Just take it.

03:39.583 --> 03:42.965
Okay Go ahead. Nice and slow.

03:43.183 --> 03:47.715
It is exactly 30 minutes since the
corrective bombs were detonated.

03:48.058 --> 03:51.333
Within the next few hours,
the world will know

03:51.433 --> 03:54.041
whether this is the end
or another beginning.

03:54.141 --> 03:58.299
The rebirth of man
or his final obituary.

03:58.516 --> 04:02.083
For the last time, man pursued
his brother with a sword,

04:02.183 --> 04:04.916
and so the final fire was kindled.

04:05.016 --> 04:07.208
The Earth that was to live forever

04:07.308 --> 04:11.291
was blasted by a great
wind towards oblivion.

04:11.391 --> 04:14.708
It is strange to think
that barely 90 days ago...

04:23.100 --> 04:25.083
Davis. Yeah?

04:25.183 --> 04:28.041
When did it collapse? Anyone in it?

04:28.141 --> 04:30.791
Try and get a local photographer.
I'll send someone.

04:30.891 --> 04:31.916
Mitchell!

04:32.016 --> 04:34.125
- Yes, Dave?
- More flood trouble.

04:34.225 --> 04:37.125
Ascot Racecourse,
new grandstand collapsed.

04:37.225 --> 04:40.250
About the only thing not underwater in
that area seems to be Windsor Castle.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.041
- Martin's down there. Take a photographer.
- Right.

04:42.141 --> 04:45.541
I think Foreign gets the splash tonight,
Dave. Big earthquake piece from Jakarta.

04:45.641 --> 04:47.541
We got enough splashes
with these floods.

04:47.641 --> 04:51.166
"Exeter marooned. Five to six
feet of water, main Devon roads.

04:51.266 --> 04:55.007
"Marines move in with high troop carriers."
I'll even take earthquakes.

04:55.475 --> 04:57.666
Steve, try and get a call
through to Plymouth.

04:57.766 --> 05:00.549
Tell Denison to give us the
latest Lynmouth position.

05:01.350 --> 05:05.791
"Add flash. Beauty queen riot.
Contestants sue each other."

05:05.891 --> 05:08.958
Yeah, we got some great pictures,
but Jeff says we're a family newspaper.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.458
Down here, Mr Davis.

05:10.558 --> 05:13.250
- Anything new on the test?
- Only the last AP report, sir.

05:13.350 --> 05:16.125
New York announces it was detonated
25 miles from the South Pole.

05:16.225 --> 05:18.666
- Must be the biggest bang yet.
- Not that test. The cricket.

05:18.766 --> 05:21.916
Oh. Sorry, sir. Still no play.
Six inches under...

05:22.016 --> 05:24.041
- Were you getting tea?
- I wasn't, Mr Davis...

05:24.141 --> 05:26.416
- Well, you are now.
- Anything else exciting?

05:26.516 --> 05:30.041
Yeah, four transatlantic jets grounded
with reported navigation trouble.

05:30.141 --> 05:32.291
- What causes navigation trouble?
- Sunspots.

05:32.391 --> 05:34.416
- Sunspots?
- Well, ask a silly question...

05:34.516 --> 05:36.708
Right here, Mr Maguire.

05:36.808 --> 05:37.958
More protest letters, sir.

05:38.058 --> 05:41.166
- No. Take 'em to Features.
- Features said take them to you, sir.

05:41.266 --> 05:44.458
I can't stop the bloody bomb.
It went off 10 days ago!

05:44.558 --> 05:45.583
All right. Put 'em down.

05:45.883 --> 05:47.875
Take those back to
the morgue, will you?

05:47.975 --> 05:50.049
- Sir.
- Yeah?

05:50.558 --> 05:53.132
No, this is Bill Maguire here.

05:53.350 --> 05:56.208
Oh, I'm sorry, Sandy. He's out
of the office at the moment.

05:56.308 --> 05:59.291
Well, yes, even reporters
have to go sometime.

05:59.391 --> 06:02.125
Yes, all right. I'll tell him.
Would you mind telling me something?

06:02.225 --> 06:04.625
I was under the impression that
you wanted a piece on thrombosis.

06:04.725 --> 06:06.405
Well, as I can only do
one thing at a time,

06:06.475 --> 06:09.007
what am I expected to do with
all these protest letters?

06:09.183 --> 06:11.416
Thank you very much
but there's 1,700 of them.

06:11.516 --> 06:14.375
Don't worry about that now. Go down
and see if my car's back, will you?

06:14.475 --> 06:15.750
It's a tan Morris in
the side entrance.

06:15.850 --> 06:18.666
If it is, Mr Stenning's probably in
Harry's Bar. Tell him he's wanted, quick.

06:18.766 --> 06:20.750
- Sir.
- And how's the thrombosis market?

06:20.850 --> 06:21.958
Great.

06:22.058 --> 06:25.458
This'll give the high-paid executive
readers a nice moment of anxiety

06:25.558 --> 06:26.678
at their breakfast tomorrow.

06:26.683 --> 06:27.924
Boy!

06:42.058 --> 06:44.750
Mr Sanderson's asking
for you, Mr Stenning.

06:44.850 --> 06:46.916
So they sent Pip the cabin
boy to bail me out.

06:47.016 --> 06:50.000
- I think he was in a hurry, sir.
- Yes, well, you just tell him I'll be coming up

06:50.100 --> 06:51.340
when he sees the bubbles.

06:51.641 --> 06:53.291
I just got to get some clips
from the library, sir.

06:53.391 --> 06:54.991
Fine. Make sure my
obituary's up-to-date.

06:55.058 --> 06:57.708
But why alter my heading? What is he
trying to do, make a job for himself?

06:57.808 --> 06:59.708
Bill, you can't print a
feature on thrombosis

06:59.808 --> 07:01.541
and call it "You too can
be the death of the party."

07:01.641 --> 07:04.666
Aw, we're all getting soft.
That's what we're all getting, soft.

07:04.766 --> 07:06.750
- Hi, Billy boy.
- Good evening.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.458
Well, your car's safely back.

07:08.558 --> 07:12.000
It's a fine vessel and should prove
seaworthy for another hundred years or so.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.708
What I don't understand,
why bother to come back?

07:14.808 --> 07:17.708
You borrow my car for lunch,
why bother to hurry back at 6:30?

07:17.808 --> 07:20.750
- I saw my kid today.
- Oh, yeah?

07:20.850 --> 07:22.708
Yeah. Battersea Pleasure Gardens.

07:22.808 --> 07:25.458
She lets me see him sometime.
It's my legal right, you know.

07:26.933 --> 07:30.458
We spent the afternoon on the ghost train,
the only customers in the rain.

07:30.558 --> 07:33.340
- You know, Sandy's been screaming for you.
- He's a nice little kid.

07:33.850 --> 07:37.382
Bright, too. Remembered
me after about 10 minutes.

07:39.891 --> 07:41.851
You can throw this lot down, too.
My floor's full.

07:41.891 --> 07:44.541
Well, what's it like
to have fan mail?

07:44.641 --> 07:47.166
Biggest experimental bang
of all time is 10 days old.

07:47.266 --> 07:49.041
Instead of being proud,
the public demands we stop it.

07:49.141 --> 07:51.000
Oh, I don't know.
The best science man in the street

07:51.100 --> 07:52.625
ought to be able pull
off a little job like that.

07:52.725 --> 07:54.041
Make a trick film maybe.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.166
Yeah, you know,

07:55.266 --> 07:57.791
the mushroom goes back into the bomb,
the bomb goes back into the plane,

07:57.891 --> 08:00.875
which flies backwards over the task force
steaming backwards from the Antarctic.

08:00.975 --> 08:02.833
Yeah, you better start climbing
backwards to Sandy's office.

08:02.933 --> 08:03.958
He wouldn't believe
you were in church.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.666
He probably wants me to
take over the Science desk.

08:05.766 --> 08:07.875
Promotion. Stenning rises again.

08:07.975 --> 08:10.208
Don't think you wouldn't be welcome.

08:10.308 --> 08:11.468
- What have we got?
- A flash.

08:11.558 --> 08:14.840
"Spitsbergen reports the largest
earth tremors ever recorded."

08:16.141 --> 08:17.916
Sorry I wasn't around, Sandy.

08:18.016 --> 08:19.666
Okay, I'm used to it.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.215
- You know anything about sunspots?
- Sunspots?

08:24.241 --> 08:25.333
You hear that static?

08:25.433 --> 08:27.625
My favourite tune. But I don't
think it'll make the top 10.

08:27.725 --> 08:29.000
I'm not joking, Pete.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.041
There's usually a lot of sunspot
static this time of year,

08:31.141 --> 08:32.957
and during the last week
it's been heavier than ever.

08:33.058 --> 08:34.832
The TV people are having
trouble with their picture.

08:34.933 --> 08:36.000
And so's the public.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.541
- Do me a 500-worder for the leading page.
- Success!

08:38.640 --> 08:41.875
Wait a minute. Here are a couple
of items about navigation trouble.

08:41.975 --> 08:44.424
- Maybe you can tie them in.
- Yeah, why not?

08:44.683 --> 08:46.583
Hey, great idea.

08:46.683 --> 08:49.041
With all these floods,
what about a Daily Express ark?

08:49.141 --> 08:50.583
Great sales promotion, Sandy.

08:50.683 --> 08:53.500
You know what, Pete? I really think
you're gonna have to try a bit harder.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.007
This paper isn't built
to carry passengers.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.674
All right?

08:59.391 --> 09:01.007
Okay.

09:04.641 --> 09:06.291
Well, Billy boy, they got
me doing your homework.

09:06.391 --> 09:07.958
500 words on sunspots.

09:08.058 --> 09:09.791
Have you seen the figures on
some of these earth tremors?

09:09.891 --> 09:11.411
Is another planet
trying to contact us?

09:11.475 --> 09:13.000
"Are you receiving me?
Are you receiving me?

09:13.100 --> 09:14.500
"You are? Well, get knotted."

09:14.600 --> 09:16.958
Must've been a hell of a big bang
to give these seismograph readings.

09:17.058 --> 09:19.215
Tell me all about sunspots, Daddy.

09:19.891 --> 09:23.625
Sunspots are caused when the rays of the
sun beat down on an unprotected torso,

09:23.725 --> 09:26.416
thus causing a sun
rash similar to acne.

09:26.516 --> 09:27.791
I thought it was clean
living that did that.

09:27.891 --> 09:28.916
Ring up the Meteorological Centre.

09:29.016 --> 09:31.583
See if you can speak to Sir John Kelly.
Maybe he'll give you some quotes.

09:31.683 --> 09:34.708
- If not, you can talk to Pat Holroyd.
- Pat Holroyd, that berk from Picture Post?

09:34.808 --> 09:37.041
Oh, he's a PRO now.
He's gone legitimate.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.166
Well, this calls for
a celebration toast.

09:39.266 --> 09:41.500
Pete, ring the Met Centre.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.958
I'll be back. It's six and a half
minutes past my medicine time.

09:45.058 --> 09:47.299
Get me the Met Centre, please.

09:54.266 --> 09:56.375
- Thanks for holding on, Bill.
- Holding on to what?

09:56.475 --> 09:59.541
My job. This may not be a revelation
to you, but, and I quote,

09:59.641 --> 10:01.416
"The thrill is gone,
Bill, it's really gone."

10:01.516 --> 10:02.541
You know what I think?

10:02.641 --> 10:04.291
I should get my finger out
and peck on the typewriter.

10:04.391 --> 10:06.666
- Roughly.
- Alcoholics of the press, unite.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.541
Yes?

10:09.641 --> 10:14.000
Oh, yes. This is Peter Stenning,
Daily Express. Sir John Kelly, please.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.833
Well, it's nice of you to be interested.
I want to speak about sunspots.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.041
Just one moment, please.
What do I do with the press?

10:19.141 --> 10:20.375
What does he want you to do?

10:20.475 --> 10:22.208
Wants to talk to
Sir John about sunspots.

10:22.308 --> 10:24.708
Oh, dreary. Press office.
No direct calls to Sir John.

10:24.808 --> 10:27.375
Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm putting
you through to the press office.

10:27.475 --> 10:30.708
Look, I don't want the press office,
dear. I want Sir John Kelly.

10:30.808 --> 10:33.375
All right, all right.
Then get me Mr Pat Holroyd.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.458
Yeah? Oh yeah, Sandy.

10:36.558 --> 10:40.125
Yes, I understand all that,
dear, but Holroyd knows me.

10:40.225 --> 10:42.708
We used to work together.
Now, just tell him Peter Stenning.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.916
No, I'd rather do this myself.
I've got my own sources...

10:46.016 --> 10:49.416
Look, just tell Mr Holroyd!
This girl's a bigger threat than radiation.

10:49.516 --> 10:53.041
I heard that remark. Listen, I don't
care if you're Lord Rothermere himself.

10:53.141 --> 10:55.666
All right, Beaverbrook. I'm putting
you through to the press office.

10:55.766 --> 10:57.250
You were gonna get me Mr Holroyd.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.125
Would you get me Professor Lambert...

10:59.225 --> 11:02.208
Listen, your job is to pass
messages on when you're asked.

11:02.308 --> 11:05.041
My job is to do what I'm told by
the people who gave me the job.

11:05.141 --> 11:07.416
And anyway, this isn't my job.
I'm from the pool.

11:07.516 --> 11:09.632
Well, why don't you
dive back in and drown?

11:10.141 --> 11:12.708
I take it you didn't get
much change out of her.

11:12.808 --> 11:15.688
I'm going over there, and I'm gonna
shake her till the tilt sign goes up.

11:15.766 --> 11:17.916
Fine. In the meantime,
shake my car keys out of your pocket.

11:18.016 --> 11:19.616
I may want to use it
before closing time.

11:21.558 --> 11:23.632
Hello. Professor Lambert?

11:24.141 --> 11:27.174
Hello. It's Bill Maguire here
of the Daily Express, Tom.

11:27.433 --> 11:32.715
Hello. Tom, about these seismograph
readings of the latest American experiment.

11:33.475 --> 11:37.174
Would you say they were bigger than
the official announcement gives out?

11:37.391 --> 11:40.049
Oh, off the record, of course.

11:41.058 --> 11:42.882
Something pretty huge?

11:57.641 --> 11:59.958
- Press office.
- Straight through. Second left.

12:00.058 --> 12:02.958
- Mr Holroyd's on the same floor, isn't he?
- No, sir. One up.

12:03.058 --> 12:06.132
- Did you have an appointment?
- No. I'm just going into the press office.

12:19.933 --> 12:24.125
Hello, Pat. Well, this is a bit
better than Picture Post. Isn't it?

12:24.225 --> 12:25.708
Stenning, what the hell do you want?

12:25.808 --> 12:27.416
- A quote on sunspots.
- Sunspots?

12:27.516 --> 12:30.875
Look, just tell me that the static,
the monsoon, the compass trouble,

12:30.975 --> 12:34.125
and the terrible shows we get on
television are all caused by sunspots.

12:34.225 --> 12:36.416
And that the sunspots are caused
by bigger bomb experiments

12:36.516 --> 12:37.636
and I'll leave you in peace.

12:37.683 --> 12:39.803
Well, there usually is a bit
of extra sunspot activity

12:39.808 --> 12:41.048
this time of the year, old boy.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.500
But I don't think it has
much to do with anything.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.000
But there could be some connection.

12:44.058 --> 12:45.666
Oh, come on, say yes.
What harm could it do you?

12:45.766 --> 12:49.208
Look, Stenning, it's nice to see you again,
but I'm afraid I'm up to my neck, old boy.

12:49.308 --> 12:51.250
All right, Miss Johnson.
Take this to the typing pool,

12:51.350 --> 12:53.340
have it mimeographed immediately.

12:53.891 --> 12:56.875
- I see you're still a bit of a liberty taker...
- Well, give me something, Pat.

12:56.975 --> 12:59.416
- I've got to get a story out of this.
- Sorry, can't oblige, old boy...

12:59.516 --> 13:02.333
But why not? It's a perfectly routine,
harmless, silly season story.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.632
- Look, Peter, you've no right to be here.
- Well, it is, isn't it?

13:06.141 --> 13:09.875
- Well, just tell me, yes or no.
- I don't have to tell you anything, Stenning.

13:09.975 --> 13:12.625
You got no special position that
entitles you to a first break

13:12.725 --> 13:14.416
on anything that
comes into this office.

13:14.516 --> 13:16.215
You mean, something has come in.

13:18.558 --> 13:20.750
- Miss Johnson?
- She's out of the office, Sir John.

13:20.850 --> 13:22.541
- Who's there?
- Holroyd, sir.

13:22.641 --> 13:25.382
- Come in immediately, Holroyd.
- Right, sir.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.500
Now, if you don't mind, Stenning...

13:27.558 --> 13:30.878
I suppose there couldn't be some information
that hasn't hit the British public yet.

13:30.891 --> 13:34.125
If there is, you'll get it when everyone
else does, in the official release.

13:34.225 --> 13:35.458
Oh, Miss Johnson,

13:35.558 --> 13:37.916
perhaps you'd take Mr Stenning
down to the press room, would you?

13:38.016 --> 13:40.916
- Of course, sir.
- It's nice to meet an old pal.

13:41.016 --> 13:44.924
- Come this way, please, Mr Stenning.
- Normally, darling, it would be a pleasure,

13:45.100 --> 13:46.580
but at the moment, work before women.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.166
The general pattern is pretty clear,
but until we get the full picture...

13:49.266 --> 13:50.291
- Yes?
- Sir John.

13:50.391 --> 13:51.750
- I have only one question to ask you.
- Who are you?

13:51.850 --> 13:53.970
I think this gentleman's come
to the wrong department.

13:54.016 --> 13:55.291
How are the effects
of the recent bomb

13:55.391 --> 13:57.083
different from all the others
we've managed to survive?

13:57.183 --> 13:59.916
I don't know what your job is, young man,
but it's not mine to speculate.

14:00.016 --> 14:02.458
- Come along, Stenning.
- But they are different, aren't they, Sir John?

14:02.558 --> 14:05.791
- You're not making this any easier...
- All right. All right. Relax.

14:05.891 --> 14:08.791
Good try, old man. But these diabolical
liberties will get you nowhere.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.424
Oh, come off it. You've gate-crashed
for a story often enough.

14:24.516 --> 14:28.041
- Oh, hello. Have you come to fix this?
- Well, I hadn't, but for you, why not?

14:28.141 --> 14:30.583
Oh, I'm sorry.
They said they'd send someone.

14:30.683 --> 14:32.250
Can I help you?
Nearly everyone's gone home.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.791
Yeah, I'd like a copy of
tonight's official line release.

14:34.891 --> 14:37.333
- Tonight's what?
- The official release, sweetie.

14:37.433 --> 14:41.965
Oh, those were all a bit smudged.
It's over-inking. I'll get you a clean one.

14:42.891 --> 14:44.250
We're in a terrible state here.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.333
What with summer holidays and flu,
we're all doing everyone else's job.

14:47.433 --> 14:48.799
It happens to the best of us.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.791
Success. No smudges.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.750
- This is all I get, sweetie?
- That's all you get.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.166
- Wouldn't like a drink, a meal or a lift home?
- That's correct.

14:55.266 --> 14:57.586
- Just for my record, I'd like your name.
- Peter Stenning.

14:57.683 --> 14:59.882
Just for my record, I'd like yours.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.708
- Peter Stenning?
- Yeah.

15:01.808 --> 15:03.458
- Express?
- Oh, you've heard of me.

15:03.558 --> 15:07.000
Oh, yes. And if you're Peter
Stenning, that's not all you get.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.250
- Oh, great, great.
- You get this, too, sweetie.

15:09.350 --> 15:12.507
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to dive back into the pool.

15:30.308 --> 15:33.833
800 grisly words on thrombosis,
and look what they do to me.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.708
"Stubborn men and
the killer they caught."

15:35.808 --> 15:37.375
What sort of impact heading is that?

15:37.475 --> 15:39.000
I might as well be working
on The Police Gazette.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.291
- You're a bit late, aren't you?
- I'm dedicated.

15:42.558 --> 15:46.215
Sounds like a flash, if anyone's interested.
Personally, I'm not. Good night, punchers.

15:46.683 --> 15:50.041
"Russia announce world's largest
nuclear test explosion,

15:50.141 --> 15:52.500
"Siberia, last Monday, 8:00 p.m.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.041
"Force of bomb stated exceeds
American by 20%." End flash.

15:56.141 --> 15:59.750
Anything you can do, I can do better. All
right. This is a change-up, next edition.

15:59.850 --> 16:02.674
Monday last, when was that? 23rd?

16:02.933 --> 16:05.958
- Monday. When was the American blast?
- Tuesday.

16:06.058 --> 16:08.000
- What time?
- Late afternoon, wasn't it? I don't know.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.875
- I can check. Messenger!
- Coming.

16:09.975 --> 16:11.541
- Library, clips on test bombs.
- Right.

16:11.641 --> 16:13.625
- No, I want you. Get Mr Maguire back.
- Yes, sir.

16:13.725 --> 16:16.916
What's the difference in time factor
between the Antarctic base and Siberia?

16:17.016 --> 16:19.083
- That'd be New Zealand time.
- I pass.

16:19.183 --> 16:21.625
If California's eight
hours behind us,

16:21.725 --> 16:23.333
they must be more
than that down there.

16:23.433 --> 16:25.590
Eighteen, twenty-four...

16:25.933 --> 16:28.375
So evening in Siberia can't
be far off the same time

16:28.475 --> 16:31.125
as early next afternoon
in the Antarctic.

16:31.225 --> 16:33.083
Which makes one hell of a story.

16:33.183 --> 16:35.333
- Now what?
- Better read that.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.083
Yeah, I know. The kid told me...

16:37.183 --> 16:39.166
We'll have a slip edition.
Get Jeff, he's at the Savoy.

16:39.266 --> 16:40.583
Head printer, fast.

16:40.683 --> 16:42.483
Give me a quick 50 words
across three columns.

16:42.516 --> 16:43.875
You got five minutes.
I'll write the headline.

16:43.975 --> 16:45.208
Now, let's have something
for the leader page.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.833
Possible effects, comparative figures.
Check actual times of explosions.

16:47.933 --> 16:48.958
Five minutes.

16:49.058 --> 16:50.750
- We'll put you in the next edition.
- Thank you very much.

16:50.850 --> 16:52.708
Where the hell's that printer?
Well, get him back from tea.

16:52.808 --> 16:55.583
You, Jock, find me the biggest
mushroom picture in the files.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.125
See if there are any stock blocks.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.375
Smudge? Slip edition coming
down in five minutes.

16:59.475 --> 17:00.924
Get a bloody move on.

17:01.808 --> 17:04.632
Don't we always? Yes. All right.

17:06.266 --> 17:09.040
Slip edition in five minutes.
Front page needs reset.

17:09.141 --> 17:11.882
What's the betting some
princess is pregnant again?

17:12.016 --> 17:13.500
There's a change-up coming down.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.882
Okay, George. Know what it is?

17:16.099 --> 17:18.714
Well, as long as they
haven't made beer illegal.

17:25.891 --> 17:28.049
One. Lift.

17:28.808 --> 17:30.375
Slip edition in 10 minutes.

17:30.475 --> 17:32.208
We'll be putting it on four machines.

17:32.308 --> 17:35.125
There's bound to be a big
re-plate on the second edition.

17:35.225 --> 17:38.041
Someone up there hates me.
I should've stayed with Woman's Own.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.674
I'll warn them.

17:41.475 --> 17:43.507
Yep, in 10 minutes. Okay.

18:00.141 --> 18:02.291
Henry. Down the chute, quick.

18:02.391 --> 18:04.715
Make sure they've got
the mushroom block.

18:09.016 --> 18:10.965
My watch stopped.

18:11.933 --> 18:13.053
Oh, for heaven's sake, Bill,

18:13.100 --> 18:14.833
drink or no drink, have I ever
missed an edition before?

18:14.933 --> 18:17.000
You missed more than one this time,
you missed the slip as well.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.125
What happened?

18:18.225 --> 18:19.666
Where were you last
Tuesday morning at 8:00?

18:19.766 --> 18:20.875
Asleep, if I had any sense.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.541
Then there's something
else you missed.

18:22.641 --> 18:25.257
Mankind let off two
for the price of one.

18:26.266 --> 18:28.291
That accounts for all that
rattling in the Spitsbergen attic.

18:28.391 --> 18:29.500
What's all this amount to?

18:29.600 --> 18:33.215
It amounts to the biggest jolt the
Earth's taken since the ice age started.

18:33.683 --> 18:37.083
Now, if you'd like to swim across
to Harry's, I'll buy you a last supper.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.125
- It's stopped raining.
- Has it?

18:39.225 --> 18:41.882
Well, don't tell Jacko,
he's liable to stop the presses.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.916
All right. Here you are, 800 words,

18:44.016 --> 18:45.416
"How to be happy, though radiated."

18:45.516 --> 18:47.708
- I suppose thrombosis comes out.
- Sorry we kept you up, Bill.

18:47.808 --> 18:50.791
Oh, it's an honour and a pleasure. I've
always wanted to work an eight-day week.

18:50.891 --> 18:53.875
- And you're listening to a dedicated man.
- Got to lose your sunspots too, Pete.

18:53.975 --> 18:55.125
Come on, Pete, we'll...

18:55.225 --> 18:56.875
- Before we get involved in another flash...
- Jacko.

18:56.975 --> 19:00.416
I had trouble with sunspots, Jacko.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.083
Yeah, I bet you did,
but it read fine.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.083
John, where's that bomb data?
Let's have it back a minute.

19:05.183 --> 19:06.424
Thank you.

19:19.975 --> 19:21.590
You coming or not?

19:23.975 --> 19:25.416
You shouldn't have done this, Bill.

19:25.516 --> 19:26.916
I know it. I should've gone home.

19:27.016 --> 19:29.375
I wouldn't have got involved in this.
I need my bloody head examined.

19:29.475 --> 19:30.924
So do you.

19:39.016 --> 19:41.799
I did go to the Met Centre, Bill.

19:45.683 --> 19:47.382
And my watch did stop.

19:47.516 --> 19:49.583
Maybe they'll give you a
presentation one when you leave.

19:49.683 --> 19:50.963
I leave tomorrow, you know that.

19:51.058 --> 19:54.166
I don't give a flop what you do, but relieve
me of the tension, if you don't mind.

19:54.266 --> 19:55.708
Yes, I know.

19:55.808 --> 19:57.083
What the hell's the
matter with you anyway?

19:57.183 --> 19:58.375
Forget it.

19:58.475 --> 20:00.756
No woman's irreplaceable,
no matter how much you love her.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.757
I told you, forget it.

20:04.016 --> 20:06.875
There'll be somebody
else sooner or later.

20:06.975 --> 20:08.375
London's full of somebody elses.

20:08.475 --> 20:10.549
And that cures everything, doctor?

20:11.058 --> 20:12.465
Does alcohol?

20:13.558 --> 20:15.424
Find yourself a girl, Pete.

20:16.433 --> 20:17.708
Find yourself a dozen.

20:17.808 --> 20:19.375
I've got your permission,
have I, Dad?

20:19.475 --> 20:22.465
Permission?
My thoughts will be with you.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.416
Well, well.
The opposition's late tonight.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.125
We don't admit any opposition, son.

20:28.225 --> 20:29.375
Mr Maguire. What will it be?

20:29.475 --> 20:31.756
- Two large lean steaks.
- Not for me. I'll have a Scotch.

20:31.808 --> 20:34.416
You'll have a steak, too. It's good
for you to eat at least once a week.

20:34.516 --> 20:37.125
Anything worth reading in
tomorrow's paper, Mr Maguire?

20:37.225 --> 20:40.333
It's all agency stuff tonight,
so you can have a look for a change.

20:40.433 --> 20:42.916
There is also a well written
article on thrombosis.

20:43.016 --> 20:44.256
One cause, eating too much fat.

20:44.350 --> 20:46.583
Oh, I'll tell you this,
there's no fat in any of mine.

20:46.683 --> 20:49.840
- Sandy know I wasn't there?
- Just get us a couple of drinks.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.180
- Get on with your orders.
- Oh, May, give it to him.

20:52.225 --> 20:54.000
Don't you take it, Harry.
Who's boss here, you or her?

20:54.100 --> 20:56.041
Knock it off, Mr Cardiff.
I know all about you.

20:56.141 --> 20:57.208
You want jackets with 'em?

20:57.308 --> 21:00.125
No. No potatoes, May.
I've read my article.

21:00.225 --> 21:01.924
What about you, Mr Stenning?

21:04.016 --> 21:05.924
Bill, what did you tell Sandy?

21:06.975 --> 21:08.416
I told him you'd phoned it in.

21:08.516 --> 21:10.833
- Hello, Peter. Still with the Express?
- For the moment.

21:10.933 --> 21:12.500
It's murder up at our place tonight.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.000
They don't know what to
make of this Russian bomb.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.500
Your lot never knew what
to make of anything.

21:15.600 --> 21:16.791
All right. Nice to have seen you.

21:16.891 --> 21:18.916
Maybe we don't spend
enough time in the bars.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.166
Would you like a nice salad?
Salad's very healthy.

21:21.266 --> 21:23.500
Is it? Just some bread, thanks, May.
Fresh for a change.

21:23.600 --> 21:27.299
- Like you?
- Yeah. Sometimes I think I could.

21:28.975 --> 21:30.965
In fact, I'm sure I could.

21:33.183 --> 21:34.799
It's the kid, isn't it?

21:35.308 --> 21:37.428
You want to see the way
they're bringing him up, Bill.

21:37.433 --> 21:39.233
It'll be the right the
right prep school next.

21:39.308 --> 21:41.166
And then the right boarding school.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.833
And by the time they've finished with
him he'll be a right bowler-hatted,

21:43.933 --> 21:47.632
"Who's for tennis", toffee-nosed gent.
But he won't be my son.

21:47.766 --> 21:51.125
Oh, I don't know. That bad blood
of yours is bound to come out.

21:51.225 --> 21:53.583
- How old is he now?
- Seven.

21:53.683 --> 21:55.958
That's a nice age. I suppose
you're still shelling out for things.

21:56.058 --> 21:59.215
If I wasn't, I wouldn't even try,
not that I'm trying too hard.

21:59.683 --> 22:02.666
- Was she there with the kid?
- Oh, no. The nanny brings him.

22:02.766 --> 22:04.291
Yes, they've got a nanny as well.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.000
Nothing but the best is good
enough for her husband's wife.

22:07.100 --> 22:10.382
- Well, If they're so well off, why should...
- Because he's my kid, that's why.

22:10.725 --> 22:12.208
Well, here's to him.

22:12.308 --> 22:16.208
May he turn out to be a hard-drinking,
hard-fighting son of a bitch.

22:16.308 --> 22:19.090
Yeah, well, that part of
his parentage is for sure.

22:20.183 --> 22:21.750
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.

22:21.850 --> 22:23.791
Oh, don't be long, ducks.
They're ready.

22:23.891 --> 22:25.541
Like a bit of butter, they'll be.

22:25.641 --> 22:27.916
We won't be needing
the other steak, May.

22:28.016 --> 22:29.250
Oh, shame.

22:29.350 --> 22:31.510
Shall I wrap it up for your
big collie dog, Mr Maguire?

22:31.516 --> 22:34.208
- How's Mrs Maguire?
- Oh, fine, fine. Just fine.

22:34.308 --> 22:37.708
I wouldn't like to be a newspaperman's
wife, coming home all hours of the night.

22:37.808 --> 22:40.048
And day. We sometimes come
home in the middle of the day.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.361
I bet that could be embarrassing.

22:43.141 --> 22:45.882
Yeah, it has been, for some.

22:48.808 --> 22:50.875
We are not a political party,

22:50.975 --> 22:52.958
and we have no intention
of becoming one.

22:54.183 --> 22:57.000
We derive our support from
individuals of all walks.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.083
The campaign for nuclear disarmament

22:59.183 --> 23:03.083
opposes all tests,
manufacture, stockpiling,

23:03.183 --> 23:06.257
possession or intended
use of nuclear weapons.

23:07.100 --> 23:10.757
The world today is imperilled
by nuclear anarchy.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.666
Nuclear weapons no longer
threaten the enemy,

23:13.766 --> 23:15.840
but the whole of mankind.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.916
The fact that we are
living in a nuclear age

23:19.016 --> 23:21.632
should be a challenge, not a threat.

23:21.808 --> 23:25.041
Instead of building bigger,
better and more weapons,

23:25.141 --> 23:29.625
we should be concentrating on the
tremendous task of feeding the hungry,

23:29.725 --> 23:32.041
healing the sick and
clothing the naked.

23:33.933 --> 23:36.340
Let us abandon our nuclear weapons...

23:41.641 --> 23:43.924
And may the best man win.

23:57.141 --> 23:59.715
- You all right?
- Yeah, but my camera!

24:10.475 --> 24:11.750
Daily Express. Can I join you?

24:11.850 --> 24:13.250
Why not? We've got
The Herald up here already.

24:13.350 --> 24:16.125
- Always ahead of the Express.
- Yeah, when it comes to getting out of fights.

24:16.225 --> 24:19.174
- Now, don't start another one up here.
- Holy smoke! Look at that!

24:21.475 --> 24:24.424
- It's an eclipse.
- That certainly wasn't in the schedule.

24:37.641 --> 24:40.291
- Lend me this for a minute, will you?
- Hey, what, what are you doing?

24:40.391 --> 24:42.375
I'm press. I want a picture out of this.
What have you got in?

24:42.475 --> 24:43.500
- Black and white or colour?
- Black and white.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.166
Wait a minute. Give me those.

24:45.266 --> 24:46.746
Hey, I've got some pictures in there.

24:46.808 --> 24:48.808
Don't worry, you'll get them
processed for nothing.

24:49.308 --> 24:51.208
- Right. Let's go.
- Go where? I don't want to go anywhere.

24:51.308 --> 24:54.465
Fleet Street. You'll get your roll back
and a dozen free. Take you 10 minutes.

24:54.975 --> 24:58.291
I don't care a tinker's damn about
this eclipse of the sun as such.

24:58.391 --> 25:01.031
The evening papers will cane it.
It'll be dead by tomorrow morning.

25:01.058 --> 25:03.708
But what I do care about is why
there's been an eclipse of the sun

25:03.808 --> 25:05.625
10 days before it was due.

25:05.725 --> 25:07.250
Bill, this is your department.

25:07.350 --> 25:09.875
I don't know why everybody
regards me as Nostradamus.

25:09.975 --> 25:13.125
- Your guess is as good as mine.
- Yes, but I don't want guesses, I want facts.

25:13.225 --> 25:15.041
Try someone on top. Sir John Kelly.

25:15.141 --> 25:17.375
What about the Astronomer
Royal at Herstmonceux?

25:17.475 --> 25:18.750
Stenning got in to see Kelly.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.125
- He had 28 fully armed guards around him.
- Yes, but what did he say?

25:22.225 --> 25:24.958
He wouldn't even say good night,
in case it was taken as an official comment

25:25.058 --> 25:26.208
on the future of mankind.

25:26.308 --> 25:27.625
Which convinces me even more

25:27.725 --> 25:29.765
that information's being
withheld in Downing Street.

25:29.766 --> 25:31.833
Here, we can't use this. Take it
across to the Evening Standard.

25:31.933 --> 25:34.750
And if you're quick with it, they might
be able to make the first late night.

25:34.850 --> 25:37.125
- I'll send a messenger right away.
- Never mind about a messenger,

25:37.225 --> 25:39.025
it's your picture.
Follow it through yourself.

25:39.808 --> 25:42.848
Does anyone really care about the weather
after the bashing they've just had?

25:42.933 --> 25:45.166
I agree. We're lucky to
have any sun to eclipse.

25:45.266 --> 25:46.458
You know something, sir?

25:46.558 --> 25:48.333
I only know what I read
in these agency reports,

25:48.433 --> 25:50.666
and I only know what
I see on this map.

25:50.766 --> 25:53.083
Southern France, Sicily, Libya.

25:53.183 --> 25:55.875
Ten days of torrential rain
in their peak summer months.

25:55.975 --> 25:59.916
The Nile flooding the Egyptian deserts
for the first time in known history.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.875
Look. It's a straight line, follow it down.
Here's Western Australia.

26:03.975 --> 26:06.666
Arid wastes two feet deep in water.

26:06.766 --> 26:10.166
New Zealand, floods.
And at home, an untabled eclipse.

26:10.266 --> 26:12.706
Are we suggesting it has something
to do with the double bomb?

26:12.766 --> 26:15.000
Oh, sure. We blew the moon
ahead of its schedule.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.083
I'm not joking about this, are you?

26:17.183 --> 26:18.583
Look, all I know is what
I read in the papers.

26:18.683 --> 26:21.125
There may be some after-effects,
atmospherically, due to the bomb,

26:21.225 --> 26:23.625
- but quite frankly, I wouldn't know.
- Well, I want to know.

26:23.641 --> 26:25.481
- Can you give us anything to go on?
- Nothing.

26:25.558 --> 26:28.291
Except that I've heard that the boffins
are running around like lunatics

26:28.391 --> 26:31.965
putting bits and pieces together that
might add up to a very big story indeed.

26:32.141 --> 26:34.458
I want it, and I want it first.
Is that clear, then?

26:34.558 --> 26:36.250
I want it first, whatever it is.

26:36.350 --> 26:39.916
Just announced, Sir John Kelly's on
television and radio before the 1:00 news.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.757
He'll have a lot of hecklers.

26:42.475 --> 26:45.166
As I am sure, most of you will know,

26:45.266 --> 26:49.465
a solar eclipse occurs as a result
of the interposition of the moon

26:49.683 --> 26:51.416
between the Earth and the Sun.

26:51.516 --> 26:53.541
And that, children,
is how the little bunny rabbit

26:53.641 --> 26:55.208
got his fluffy white tail.

26:55.308 --> 26:58.416
When one considers the
moon is 240,000 miles away

26:58.516 --> 27:00.708
and the sun 93 million,

27:00.808 --> 27:05.416
it is an extraordinary thing that astronomers
can tell with such a degree of accuracy

27:05.516 --> 27:07.958
what their movements will
be many years ahead.

27:08.058 --> 27:09.416
Now, what does that mean?

27:09.516 --> 27:11.958
- It means he doesn't know what it's all about.
- Right.

27:12.058 --> 27:14.041
Start searching for wild causes.

27:14.141 --> 27:16.750
In this case, many of you will blame

27:16.850 --> 27:19.916
the unfortunate concurrence
of the two nuclear detonations.

27:20.016 --> 27:22.041
But, of course, this is nonsense.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.166
- It is certainly nothing to worry about.
- Of course not.

27:25.266 --> 27:26.708
It's all good, clean fun.

27:26.808 --> 27:29.416
Just light the blue paper and
retire to a safe distance.

27:29.516 --> 27:31.549
Get me another drink, will you?

28:37.058 --> 28:39.215
Come on, then. Out you get.

28:40.016 --> 28:42.500
What shall we go on now?
Let's go on this one.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.125
- What, again?
- Yes, let's go on it again.

28:45.225 --> 28:48.416
- No, let's go on the ghost train.
- Well, we haven't much time left.

28:48.516 --> 28:50.708
Yes, we have! Yes, we have!

28:50.808 --> 28:53.174
- Come on, then.
- Good!

29:30.600 --> 29:32.250
Out you get.

29:32.350 --> 29:33.924
Alley-oop!

29:34.433 --> 29:36.424
Let's go in again.

29:37.558 --> 29:38.958
I wish we had time, Mike.

29:39.058 --> 29:41.333
You shouldn't take him into
that place, Mr Stenning,

29:41.433 --> 29:43.916
it makes him dream.
We'll have to go back now.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.958
No! I'm going to stay here forever.

29:46.058 --> 29:47.166
I'm going to live here.

29:47.266 --> 29:50.465
- Now, don't be silly.
- No, you better go now, Mike. It's almost 1:00.

29:50.891 --> 29:53.458
And will we go on the
ghost train next Sunday?

29:53.558 --> 29:54.750
Yes, we will.

29:54.850 --> 29:57.924
You really make things very
difficult for me, Mr Stenning.

29:58.641 --> 30:00.590
Good-bye then, Daddy.

30:03.475 --> 30:04.583
Good-bye, son.

30:04.683 --> 30:07.549
Now, come along, Michael,
or your mother'll be angry.

30:20.641 --> 30:22.340
One of each.

30:33.475 --> 30:36.166
Well, it just shows you
what the sun brings out.

30:36.266 --> 30:39.958
Quite a day to jump in a pool, isn't it?
Made any good connections lately?

30:40.058 --> 30:41.500
Please. This is my day off.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.250
Come the revolution,
and we'll all have Sunday off.

30:43.350 --> 30:45.291
I have to be in the
office two hours ago.

30:45.391 --> 30:49.215
I hate to think of them trying to print
that great big paper without you.

30:49.475 --> 30:52.424
- Tell me something, Miss, er...
- "Miss Er" will do.

30:52.558 --> 30:54.541
Are you anti-press or just anti-me?

30:54.641 --> 30:57.708
On the contrary, I wish you the
best of luck on your prowl.

30:57.808 --> 31:00.248
You'll find the bikini section
of the forest nearer the river.

31:00.266 --> 31:02.500
- Why don't you howl over there.
- Oh, come on, now, what did I do?

31:02.600 --> 31:03.680
- What...?
- I know, I know.

31:03.766 --> 31:04.791
I shouted at you on the phone.

31:04.891 --> 31:07.291
But that was four weeks ago,
does there have to be a blood feud?

31:07.391 --> 31:09.500
Besides, I was under stress
and sober at that time.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.916
It was my first day on that board.
I did some terrible things.

31:13.016 --> 31:16.500
I connected Mr Holroyd with his wife
and he though he was talking to his...

31:16.600 --> 31:19.041
Oh, dear. I shouldn't
have told you that.

31:19.141 --> 31:20.208
Why not? It made my day.

31:20.308 --> 31:24.340
No, a switchboard is very confidential, and
an Air Ministry one is even more "very".

31:24.558 --> 31:26.257
How "very" is your phone number?

31:27.516 --> 31:30.549
- It's a bad line. You get nothing but crackle.
- I love crackle.

31:31.225 --> 31:32.500
You're sitting on my skirt.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.208
Oh, sorry. Look, there's a lunch
place down there by the boating pool.

31:36.308 --> 31:38.125
We could get fish and chips
and pretend we're in Venice.

31:38.225 --> 31:39.507
Sundays I don't eat lunch.

31:41.266 --> 31:44.625
- Okay, Miss Er.
- And that's not feuding, it's dieting.

31:44.725 --> 31:47.250
- Dinner?
- No. Tonight's hair wash night.

31:47.350 --> 31:49.750
Well, that lets out breakfast,
because I can't stand those pins.

31:49.850 --> 31:51.868
If you turn over quick,
you can lose an eye.

32:23.933 --> 32:25.693
Well, I suppose that's
the end of our summer.

32:25.766 --> 32:29.416
Well, we'd better get on the main
road while we can still find our way there.

32:29.516 --> 32:31.458
I've got to get my things first.
I left them over here.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.083
Don't you get lost as well.

32:33.183 --> 32:35.632
No, not that way. That's the river.

32:36.058 --> 32:38.000
- Okay, I found them.
- Well, that's great.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.583
Now, do you think you can find me?

32:39.683 --> 32:43.291
- Keep talking.
- Control to Miss Er. Control to Miss Er.

32:43.391 --> 32:47.049
Waiting for you to come on in.
Come on in. The water's fine.

32:48.698 --> 32:50.958
- What about this?
- It's terrible, isn't it?

32:53.475 --> 32:55.674
Anyone with that kid?

32:56.475 --> 32:57.958
Sounds like a lost child somewhere.

33:04.600 --> 33:08.250
Hello there. Are you lost? Now, stop crying.
We're lost, too, and we're not crying, are we?

33:08.350 --> 33:10.500
Who did you come here with?
Mummy? Daddy?

33:10.600 --> 33:12.215
What's your name, sweetie?

33:12.433 --> 33:14.193
Well, we seem to have
made a big impact here.

33:14.225 --> 33:15.541
What do you think we should do?

33:15.641 --> 33:17.333
Well, there's only one thing to do.

33:17.433 --> 33:18.916
The three of us must head
for the nearest cave,

33:19.016 --> 33:21.715
face the future with courage and
vow to carry on the human race.

33:22.016 --> 33:23.916
There's usually a policeman
at the main gate.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.916
My name's Peter.
Won't you tell me yours?

33:26.016 --> 33:28.799
Well, we'll just have to
call her Miss Erjunior.

33:29.058 --> 33:31.625
Make it senior.
I'm changing mine to Jeannie.

33:31.725 --> 33:33.875
- Jeannie what?
- Craig. Is that all right?

33:33.975 --> 33:36.965
Yeah. Most suitable.
Sort of Scotch, like the mist.

33:37.975 --> 33:39.958
There you are.
Now you're taller than all of us.

33:40.058 --> 33:42.166
- It's not like normal fog, is it?
- Heat mist.

33:42.266 --> 33:43.875
- What, this thick?
- Well, it's your switchboard,

33:43.975 --> 33:45.041
you should know.

33:45.241 --> 33:46.674
Let's get out of the road.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.708
How you doing up there, partner?

33:48.808 --> 33:50.882
See anyone you know?

33:53.058 --> 33:54.208
So?

33:54.308 --> 33:56.250
You look as if you're used
to carrying children.

33:56.350 --> 33:58.965
My doctor says I have
the perfect figure for it.

33:59.558 --> 34:02.007
Also, I have a child of my own.

34:04.266 --> 34:07.375
- We found an abandoned lady in the park.
- But she won't talk.

34:07.475 --> 34:10.291
- Well, now, and your what's name, my dear?
- Trixie.

34:10.391 --> 34:12.666
- And who did you come up with, Trixie?
- Rita.

34:12.766 --> 34:15.208
Well, you stay with me, and we'll
wait for Rita to come out, all right?

34:15.308 --> 34:16.549
Yes.

34:21.933 --> 34:24.083
- Where do you live?
- Embankment Terrace.

34:24.183 --> 34:26.590
Come on, we'd better hop on this.

34:27.141 --> 34:29.875
Bloody marvellous, isn't it?
Clear as a bell on the top deck.

34:29.975 --> 34:31.250
We've had the lot this summer?

34:31.350 --> 34:33.510
Not yet, but there'll be three
feet of snow by teatime.

34:33.516 --> 34:35.424
You don't want to joke about that.

34:40.725 --> 34:42.166
Looks spooky, doesn't it?

34:42.266 --> 34:45.000
I'm fascinated to know what your
friend Holroyd makes of this.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.250
He's not my friend. I just
work for him now and then.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.132
- And turn down all his passes?
- He's harmless.

34:50.516 --> 34:52.833
Nobody's harmless,
not if they're normal.

34:52.933 --> 34:54.791
- And you're normal?
- So far.

34:54.891 --> 34:57.791
There's very few of us normals left,
you know. You should always be nice to us.

34:57.891 --> 35:00.000
Is it a boy or a girl?

35:00.100 --> 35:01.465
Your child?

35:01.975 --> 35:03.215
A boy.

35:03.433 --> 35:05.291
- Are you married?
- Divorced.

35:05.391 --> 35:07.166
I meet him there once a week.
He likes the funfair.

35:07.266 --> 35:08.500
All kids do, don't they?

35:08.600 --> 35:12.000
He wants to live there, on the ghost train,
if it can be rented reasonably.

35:14.558 --> 35:16.507
Sounds like our cue to walk.

35:16.933 --> 35:21.299
Hello, hello, hello. Sorry,
I was following the white line.

35:38.516 --> 35:41.083
Sorry, this station's closed for
the time being. I'm sorry, sir.

35:41.183 --> 35:43.174
No trains for a while, madam.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.598
Looks as if the Underground's closed.
Will you wait while I phone the office?

35:46.641 --> 35:49.721
- Sorry, sir, the station's closed.
- I'm press. I only want to use the phone.

35:49.808 --> 35:52.166
If I let you in, they'd all want to.
It's chaos down there as it is.

35:52.266 --> 35:53.333
Why? What happened?

35:53.433 --> 35:56.033
Well, this fog's coming down the
air shafts and along the tunnels.

35:56.058 --> 35:58.958
It's a good thing you live within
groping distance. Which way?

35:59.058 --> 36:00.674
That way.

36:08.058 --> 36:10.333
We turn left in a minute,
about 20 yards.

36:10.433 --> 36:13.333
You time it, I'll pace it.
One, two, three...

36:13.433 --> 36:14.500
What comes after three? Oh, yes...

36:14.600 --> 36:16.965
There's a telephone in my
flat if you care to use it.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.840
- Without prejudice, of course.
- Naturally.

36:21.308 --> 36:23.674
I'm turning left.
I don't know about you.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.583
Yes, please? Oh, Miss Craig.

36:26.683 --> 36:28.333
- Quite a day, isn't it?
- Certainly is, miss.

36:28.433 --> 36:29.583
There's just been a fog warning.

36:29.683 --> 36:31.625
- The whole country's covered in it.
- That's Britain today.

36:31.725 --> 36:32.750
What we have, we share.

36:32.850 --> 36:35.041
You know, they say,
it's not what you call a true fog.

36:35.141 --> 36:36.500
More like a sort of heat mist.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.291
Heavier than your typical fog, it is.

36:38.391 --> 36:41.833
- Thanks for the breakdown.
- Hey, mister. Where are we, mister?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.458
- Ask him, Dad.
- Where are we, mister?

36:44.558 --> 36:47.250
- We're trying to find the coach station.
- Ask him, Mum.

36:47.350 --> 36:50.291
- I just asked him.
- No, I want to go to the toilet.

36:50.391 --> 36:52.375
You wait till the coach station.
Tell her, Dad.

36:52.475 --> 36:54.000
You wait till the coach station.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.708
- Oh, the coach station.
- Yeah.

36:55.808 --> 36:57.208
You want to try and
get to the embankment.

36:57.308 --> 36:59.428
- Look, I'll show you.
- That's right, the embankment.

36:59.808 --> 37:03.208
Now, now, keep going till you
come to the T-road, right?

37:03.308 --> 37:05.625
- Brings you straight onto the embankment.
- Where are we, mate?

37:05.725 --> 37:10.083
- Embankment Crescent.
- Just shows. It should be Sloane Square.

37:10.183 --> 37:12.424
I've gotta go, Mum.

37:12.641 --> 37:15.625
Why you can't wait?
It's the same at the pictures.

37:15.725 --> 37:19.500
Well, I don't know. I shouldn't think they'll
be running many coaches in this fog.

37:19.600 --> 37:20.882
Oh, dear.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.291
Really, it's stifling.

37:33.391 --> 37:35.882
Are there more expensive
apartments above the mist line?

37:36.391 --> 37:39.507
- Looks fantastic, doesn't it?
- With a bit of luck, it'll go on forever.

37:39.683 --> 37:41.625
You came to telephone, Mr Stenning.

37:41.725 --> 37:44.958
- Aren't you even going to offer me a drink?
- Yes, if you don't mind instant coffee.

37:45.058 --> 37:47.375
Coffee? What are you
trying to do, corrupt me?

37:47.475 --> 37:49.666
- The phone's by the bed.
- Nice and handy to call for help.

37:49.766 --> 37:51.791
So far, I haven't
had to call for help.

37:51.891 --> 37:53.083
That's your fault or his?

37:53.183 --> 37:55.924
- There doesn't happen to be a "his".
- I'm not surprised.

37:56.183 --> 37:57.500
And what exactly does that mean?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.720
Well, If they all get the
same treatment that I got...

37:59.725 --> 38:02.757
You happened to walk in at
the end of a black Monday.

38:03.475 --> 38:04.791
What about a foggy Sunday?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.291
Come on, now, Pete.
We're too old for...

38:06.391 --> 38:07.541
I'm not too old.

38:07.641 --> 38:08.875
I said you could use
the phone, and that's all.

38:08.975 --> 38:10.833
Oh, come on now, Jeannie.
What do you want, a slow build-up?

38:10.933 --> 38:12.958
Hot hands at the movies?
Knee troubles at a coffee bar?

38:13.058 --> 38:17.424
This seems to be where we came in.
Do me a favour, just use the phone and go.

38:20.683 --> 38:22.924
Lady says you gotta go, you gotta go.

38:27.933 --> 38:30.090
You don't dial. The porter gets it.

38:33.058 --> 38:34.375
I'm sorry, Jeannie.

38:34.475 --> 38:36.458
You're a case,
Pete Stenning, a real case.

38:36.558 --> 38:39.083
Yep, that's me, "Knock 'em down,
drag 'em out Pete Stenning,

38:39.183 --> 38:41.333
"the battered caveman."
Fleet Street 8000, please.

38:41.433 --> 38:43.583
What is this "look at me,
I'm so tough" act?

38:43.683 --> 38:45.541
Oh, I am tough, Jeannie.
Tough and chewed up.

38:45.641 --> 38:48.000
- Not the way you drink.
- Bill Maguire.

38:48.100 --> 38:51.291
Alcoholics take it because they can't
take it. I read that in The Guardian.

38:51.391 --> 38:52.831
What do you know about me and drink?

38:52.891 --> 38:54.958
It's in the Met Centre
facts of life file.

38:55.058 --> 38:57.500
Dogs bark, cats meow
and Stenning drinks.

38:57.600 --> 39:00.208
- Yeah?
- Bill, this is Pete.

39:00.308 --> 39:01.541
I'll make the coffee.

39:01.641 --> 39:03.840
Yeah, we seem fated
to be apart, don't we?

39:03.975 --> 39:05.083
As soon as I can.

39:05.183 --> 39:07.708
Stupidly, I forgot to pack
my radar kit this morning.

39:07.808 --> 39:10.250
Half the boys have been caught
short, so you won't be missed.

39:10.350 --> 39:12.424
What's your number there, in case?

39:13.183 --> 39:14.416
How long will you be there?

39:14.516 --> 39:17.757
Well, just as long as it takes to make
and drink a cup of instant coffee.

39:17.975 --> 39:21.465
Yes, coffee. No, it's not a pub.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.708
More a sort of a club, really.

39:23.808 --> 39:25.250
Jeannie's Club.

39:25.350 --> 39:27.541
Yes. I am a temporary
dis-honourary member.

39:27.641 --> 39:28.961
You wanna watch that coffee kick,

39:29.016 --> 39:30.916
before you know it you'll be
joining Caffeine's Anonymous.

39:31.016 --> 39:33.166
What the hell kind of fog only
comes up to the fourth floor?

39:33.266 --> 39:36.125
It knows better than to come up here.
This place is like the anteroom to hell.

39:36.225 --> 39:38.208
It's really chaos at London
airport, Mr Maguire.

39:38.308 --> 39:39.333
It usually is.

39:39.433 --> 39:40.875
The question is, how do
we get home tonight?

39:40.975 --> 39:42.833
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

39:43.033 --> 39:44.882
And New York is still clear?

39:45.266 --> 39:49.007
Yeah, Shannon's closing in.
Hold on. News desk.

39:49.225 --> 39:50.385
Yes, sir, I'll bring them in.

39:50.433 --> 39:51.791
Yeah, I've got that.

39:51.891 --> 39:55.174
Madrid, Lisbon, New York, clear.
Right? Check back in an hour.

39:55.433 --> 39:58.125
News conference, now.
The gaffer says you too.

39:58.225 --> 40:00.791
Yeah, I know, he wants a 50-word
by-line from the Almighty.

40:00.891 --> 40:03.583
Hate to think what the roads back from
the coast are gonna be like tonight.

40:03.683 --> 40:07.458
I know what I'm gonna be like. I promised
myself a night of booze and orgy for years.

40:07.558 --> 40:09.666
Where's this great
exhibition gonna take place?

40:09.766 --> 40:12.000
I shall grope my way over to Harry's.

40:12.100 --> 40:14.125
And who's the orgy
going to be with? May?

40:14.225 --> 40:15.375
If you can keep Harry busy.

40:15.475 --> 40:19.083
Now, get me Professor Jacovski,
US Weather Bureau, Washington DC.

40:19.183 --> 40:22.291
And I don't want his assistant,
his secretary or his wife.

40:22.391 --> 40:24.166
Make it person-to-person.

40:24.266 --> 40:26.708
Well, boys, this is going
to be a night of nights.

40:26.808 --> 40:28.208
If we're gonna catch the trains,

40:28.308 --> 40:29.958
we'll have to go to press
at least an hour earlier.

40:30.058 --> 40:31.583
- Can't be done.
- It's got to be done.

40:31.683 --> 40:33.833
We've got to play this mist,
and we've got to play it big.

40:33.933 --> 40:35.791
I want to give it
saturation coverage.

40:35.891 --> 40:38.916
I want a recap on the rain,
the heat wave, the eclipse.

40:39.016 --> 40:42.000
I want a comparison of the
statistics and weather charts

40:42.100 --> 40:45.166
going right back to the first
meteorological reports in 1854.

40:45.266 --> 40:47.208
You can go back as far
as Galileo, if you like.

40:47.308 --> 40:49.250
I want to know if anything
like these conditions

40:49.350 --> 40:51.166
has ever happened
in recorded history.

40:51.266 --> 40:53.500
- What pictures have you got?
- We've got some shot from our roof.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.708
That's no good. Let's have an aerial
panorama of London above the fog.

40:56.808 --> 40:59.041
Aerial? In this place?

40:59.141 --> 41:01.625
Well, get a helicopter.
It's only got to go up and down.

41:01.725 --> 41:05.215
Send Benny to the heliport
now before the light goes.

41:07.558 --> 41:10.166
Where is everybody? Most of
them are still trying to get back.

41:10.266 --> 41:11.416
The night staff haven't
shown at all yet.

41:11.516 --> 41:13.500
If it's a heat mist,
it can't last long.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.125
"If" being the operative word.

41:15.225 --> 41:18.425
We've all seen a heat mist that rises a
few feet above the ground in hot weather,

41:18.516 --> 41:20.208
but this one's four storeys high.

41:20.308 --> 41:23.715
And in two hours it's virtually
paralysed a third of the globe.

41:23.850 --> 41:27.541
Look, France, Italy,
here and even India.

41:27.641 --> 41:29.881
What sort of treatment, Jeff?
Do we still link the bombs?

41:29.933 --> 41:33.500
We do, and we go on linking them until
someone up top proves how we're wrong.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.400
- I want something from you on this, Bill.
- Yes, I was afraid of that.

41:36.475 --> 41:38.291
- Any angles?
- Oh, a couple.

41:38.391 --> 41:40.166
This mist could be caused by

41:40.266 --> 41:43.500
an unusual amount of condensation
from the unusual heat

41:43.600 --> 41:45.125
following all that rain.

41:45.225 --> 41:47.458
- Alternatively...
- Alternatively what?

41:47.558 --> 41:50.791
Well, this is just a personal guess.
I wouldn't dare to put it into print.

41:50.891 --> 41:53.174
Let me decide what goes
into print. You just give.

41:53.391 --> 41:56.166
Could be caused by a mass
of extremely cold water

41:56.266 --> 41:58.916
- penetrating into the warmer currents.
- What's that mean?

41:59.016 --> 42:01.375
An unusual amount of
melting ice at both poles.

42:01.475 --> 42:03.000
Surely that would also mean floods.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.833
They've already had them in
Australia and New Zealand.

42:04.933 --> 42:07.541
Are you telling me that the heat
of the bombs melted the ice caps?

42:07.641 --> 42:10.791
No, sir. That wouldn't melt enough
ice to flood the Isle of Wight.

42:10.891 --> 42:12.965
But if they did go off together...

42:13.516 --> 42:16.340
Supposing the combined
thrust of the explosions

42:16.600 --> 42:18.041
shifted the tilt of the Earth.

42:18.141 --> 42:19.507
Oh, come on, Bill.

42:19.766 --> 42:23.924
That would alter the climatic regions,
a complete change in the world's weather.

42:24.225 --> 42:28.174
A new ice age for some,
new tropics, a new Equator.

42:28.516 --> 42:30.333
I don't know what else,
it's all guesswork.

42:30.433 --> 42:32.090
It's all science fiction.

42:32.225 --> 42:34.333
So were rockets to the moon
and manned satellites.

42:34.433 --> 42:36.424
We're gonna have to move, sir.

42:37.100 --> 42:40.465
Yes? Right? Miss Evans?

42:40.641 --> 42:42.416
All right, move and hit hard.

42:42.516 --> 42:44.958
Bill, write your story. I'm not
sold on it, but I'll print it.

42:45.058 --> 42:46.541
It might force something big.

42:46.641 --> 42:49.041
Professor Jakovski.
Just a minute, please. Hold on.

42:49.141 --> 42:51.916
We'll try it on him. Any quotes,
you will get them.

42:52.016 --> 42:53.500
Professor Jakovski?

42:53.600 --> 42:55.340
This is the Daily Express, London.

42:56.891 --> 43:00.166
You're not getting any fancy flying.
The deal is straight up, straight down.

43:00.266 --> 43:03.465
Don't think this is my favourite
assignment, 'cause it isn't.

43:13.183 --> 43:15.458
Now we're up, what about
a look at London airport?

43:15.558 --> 43:17.083
Some things just aren't possible.

43:17.183 --> 43:19.916
My orders are, everything's possible,
even the Indian rope trick.

43:20.016 --> 43:21.549
You may need that to get down.

43:24.683 --> 43:26.125
May I have your attention, please.

43:26.225 --> 43:29.333
All flight departures have
been delayed for another hour.

43:29.433 --> 43:34.132
Travel information may be obtained from
the information desk opposite channel 7.

43:34.266 --> 43:37.833
London approach.
Speedbird 352 leaving Watford.

43:37.933 --> 43:39.458
Roger, 352.

43:39.558 --> 43:41.625
Descend to 2,000 feet on
your present heading.

43:41.725 --> 43:43.458
2,000 feet. Roger.

43:43.558 --> 43:46.875
Sorry, KLM 603. Have to return you.
Priority transatlantic only.

43:46.975 --> 43:50.541
KLM 603. What is the
Amsterdam weather?

43:50.641 --> 43:53.507
Hello, 603.
Visibility, 50 yards in fog.

43:53.933 --> 43:58.166
Speedbird 352 intercepting
the ILS beam at 2,000 feet.

43:58.266 --> 44:02.424
Roger, 352. The runway
visibility now is 80 yards.

44:32.558 --> 44:34.083
Oh, no.

44:34.483 --> 44:37.382
Okay, Colonel,
let down the drawbridge.

44:39.475 --> 44:40.958
You been to Fleet
Street already, sir?

44:41.058 --> 44:44.166
I've been on a hike where all streets
turn left and all roads lead to home.

44:44.266 --> 44:47.166
Fortunately, I found this in a
sand dune just past Benghazi.

44:47.266 --> 44:50.791
It's getting hotter, too. 91 degrees.
It's gonna be quite a summer.

44:50.891 --> 44:53.083
Well, let us share a toast, Colonel.

44:53.183 --> 44:57.250
I give you this battered and benumbed
world of sweaty moles and radio static.

44:57.350 --> 44:59.541
- You can have it.
- Oh, thanks very much, sir.

44:59.641 --> 45:03.299
We interrupt this programme to bring
you further Air Ministry bulletin.

45:03.641 --> 45:08.083
The freak mist which has hit the British
isles is likely to increase in density

45:08.183 --> 45:09.458
for the next few hours.

45:09.558 --> 45:11.000
And the best of British luck.

45:11.100 --> 45:12.458
The police have asked the public

45:12.558 --> 45:15.375
to keep the roads clear
for essential transport

45:15.475 --> 45:19.458
and avoid traffic congestion by arranging,
where possible, to stay where they are.

45:19.558 --> 45:21.833
I think our British police are wonderful.
Where's the house phone?

45:21.933 --> 45:23.208
Over there, sir.

45:23.308 --> 45:25.965
We return you now to
late night dance music.

45:54.516 --> 45:56.465
- Hello?
- Guess who.

45:56.641 --> 45:58.208
Clever girl. Were you asleep?

45:58.308 --> 46:01.041
No, I was just washing my hair.
Did you make it all right?

46:01.141 --> 46:03.299
I certainly did, I'm back downstairs.

46:03.433 --> 46:06.166
Well, it's a two-hour story.
You listening to the radio?

46:06.266 --> 46:07.916
Did you hear that bulletin?

46:08.016 --> 46:10.549
So, are you pro-police
or anti-police?

46:12.308 --> 46:13.541
Yes. Yes, I'm still with you.

46:13.641 --> 46:16.000
I was just trying to work
out all the permutations.

46:16.100 --> 46:17.166
There's only two of them.

46:17.266 --> 46:20.875
You can send me out into the cold, cold snow
and let me get lost with the rest of the kids,

46:20.975 --> 46:24.208
or you can utter two one-syllable words
and become a law-abiding citizen.

46:24.308 --> 46:26.340
Can you be one, too?

46:27.375 --> 46:29.958
Well, since this thing seems to
be bigger than both of us...

47:03.308 --> 47:06.424
- I'm beginning to think you arranged this.
- But of course.

47:07.141 --> 47:08.875
You look cute, sort of boyish.

47:08.975 --> 47:11.340
I am. Well, just remember,
you're normal.

47:11.725 --> 47:13.083
Yes.

47:13.183 --> 47:16.250
Well, this is all very sweet and spontaneous.
I don't mind sleeping on the couch.

47:16.350 --> 47:17.375
Haven't got a couch.

47:17.475 --> 47:20.000
Oh, in that case, I'll cuddle up on
the floor at the bottom of your bed

47:20.100 --> 47:21.300
like a faithful Saint Bernard.

47:21.391 --> 47:22.458
Oh no, you won't.

47:22.558 --> 47:24.041
Can't we just have a flaming
fog flare between us?

47:24.141 --> 47:26.250
Won't be necessary. If you're
staying, you're sleeping in here.

47:26.350 --> 47:27.916
I've got a feeling you've
been through all this before.

47:28.016 --> 47:29.416
- I have not.
- You mean, I'm the first man

47:29.516 --> 47:31.041
you've managed to trap
up here for the night?

47:31.141 --> 47:33.208
It's perfectly comfortable with
a pillow and a couple of sheets.

47:33.308 --> 47:34.375
Excuse me.

47:34.475 --> 47:36.291
Well, supposing you want to
use the bathroom in the night?

47:36.391 --> 47:38.840
We'll deal with each
problem as we get to it.

47:43.725 --> 47:45.507
I have a big problem, Jeannie.

47:45.933 --> 47:47.924
As well as being normal, I'm human.

47:48.308 --> 47:50.340
You're also a pushover, Pete.

47:51.016 --> 47:52.549
Meaning you're not interested.

47:52.891 --> 47:56.666
Maybe I could be, but don't
make it so easy. Be hard to get.

47:56.766 --> 47:58.465
Make me fight for you.

48:01.266 --> 48:03.007
It's an unfair contest.

48:03.141 --> 48:05.632
Well, who knows,
you might even be lovable.

48:05.933 --> 48:08.625
But don't rush me.
I'm allergic to one-night stands.

48:08.725 --> 48:10.458
Now if you'll give me five minutes,
I'll finish my hair.

48:10.558 --> 48:12.541
Normally I'd offer to help,
but in the circumstances...

48:12.641 --> 48:15.083
In the circumstances,
you can take a well-earned nightcap.

48:15.183 --> 48:17.263
There should be a bottle
of something in the kitchen.

48:17.350 --> 48:19.208
I forgot, Saint Bernards'
carry their own.

48:19.308 --> 48:21.965
- You'll get a glass in there, too.
- Maybe I will.

48:27.975 --> 48:29.549
Maybe I won't.

48:36.266 --> 48:38.715
- Did you find it?
- Yes, I found it.

48:39.141 --> 48:41.833
Look, if I've got to play hard-to-get
for you to go steady with me,

48:41.933 --> 48:43.708
how about a few immigration details?

48:43.808 --> 48:47.125
- Such as?
- Oh, where you slept for the last seven years.

48:47.225 --> 48:50.583
Have you ever suffered from marriage,
divorce or any similar virus?

48:50.683 --> 48:54.090
Only two near infections.
Any other inquiries?

48:54.433 --> 48:56.507
No, the rest seems to be all right.

49:00.183 --> 49:01.757
Maybe I will.

49:05.016 --> 49:06.083
One or two pillows?

49:06.183 --> 49:07.833
Oh, I'll just wedge my
head between the taps.

49:07.933 --> 49:11.382
I'd offer you a pair of my pyjamas,
but it's a bit hot, isn't it?

49:11.600 --> 49:13.958
Yeah. You wouldn't like to come
into my place for a drink?

49:14.058 --> 49:16.458
- It's against the house rules.
- You like your guests sober.

49:16.725 --> 49:18.049
I like you sober.

49:25.641 --> 49:27.125
Good night, Jeannie.

49:27.225 --> 49:28.291
Good night, Pete.

49:28.391 --> 49:30.715
And thanks, for the
use of the bathroom.

49:31.600 --> 49:33.174
You're welcome.

49:35.850 --> 49:37.382
Sleep well.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.715
Hello?

50:22.475 --> 50:24.174
Jeannie's Club?

50:25.016 --> 50:27.340
Oh, yes. Just a minute.

50:27.641 --> 50:29.333
- Pete!
- Yeah?

50:29.433 --> 50:30.833
Phone.

50:30.933 --> 50:33.053
So, what do we do now?
Can you push it under the door?

50:33.058 --> 50:34.958
Come and get it, idiot.

50:35.058 --> 50:37.007
Just a minute, please.

50:38.141 --> 50:40.215
Sorry. It must be the office.

50:42.558 --> 50:43.840
Yes? Stenning here.

50:44.058 --> 50:47.166
We just put the first edition to bed
without you. I hope that's all right.

50:47.266 --> 50:50.708
Okay, okay. It caught you there,
it caught me here. There's no justice.

50:50.808 --> 50:51.888
But just to even things up,

50:51.933 --> 50:53.625
you can call round at the
Met Centre tomorrow morning

50:53.725 --> 50:56.799
and get me some comparative ice
floe figures for the last 20 years.

50:57.016 --> 50:58.750
You'll be surprised at what
I might bring you tomorrow.

50:58.850 --> 51:00.924
I've... I've made a new contact.

51:01.266 --> 51:04.208
Well, they're rather
fussy about new members.

51:04.308 --> 51:08.041
You have to be vouched for by two friends,
and you don't have two friends.

51:08.141 --> 51:09.965
Yeah, you too, you vulgar man.

51:10.850 --> 51:12.416
Compromised while telephoning.

51:12.516 --> 51:15.125
- What does it all mean, Pete?
- It means you'll probably have to marry me.

51:15.225 --> 51:17.416
I mean the mist and this
crazy weather. What is it?

51:17.516 --> 51:20.041
Don't ask me. You know more
about what's going on than I do.

51:20.141 --> 51:21.208
- Oh, but Bill...
- Oh, come on now, Jeannie.

51:21.308 --> 51:22.583
You've been running around
that office for months,

51:22.683 --> 51:24.833
trying to hide signs of the
elephants that passed.

51:24.933 --> 51:26.458
I don't understand half
the things I hear anyway.

51:26.558 --> 51:29.049
Such as? I'm no mastermind,
but such as?

51:32.183 --> 51:35.340
Be fair. I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

51:36.141 --> 51:38.257
So far, that's all you've done.

51:39.016 --> 51:41.090
- Let's change the subject, shall we?
- To what?

51:41.516 --> 51:42.833
- Pete Stenning.
- Too dull.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.049
- What happened, Pete?
- What, "What happened"?

51:45.475 --> 51:47.174
They say you used to be a writer.

51:48.766 --> 51:51.875
Look, let's just put that subject on the
same list as the weather, shall we?

51:51.975 --> 51:54.757
Well, that leaves us with
nothing to talk about.

51:55.433 --> 51:56.875
Do we have to talk?

51:56.975 --> 51:59.257
- No, but seriously...
- I'm not unserious, Jeannie.

52:02.225 --> 52:04.882
- Your bath's getting cold.
- Look, Jeannie.

52:06.475 --> 52:08.041
I don't wanna make love to you.

52:08.141 --> 52:10.590
I don't wanna hold you or kiss you,

52:10.725 --> 52:13.174
because you don't appeal
to me one little bit.

52:13.725 --> 52:16.424
But please fight for me, Jeannie.

52:30.141 --> 52:31.833
Do you think it will
last a long time?

52:31.933 --> 52:33.291
- The fog?
- Us.

52:33.391 --> 52:36.166
Why do women worry about
the end right at the beginning.

52:36.266 --> 52:37.625
- I'm not women.
- I mean...

52:37.725 --> 52:40.375
- I know what you mean.
- So move over, then.

54:14.975 --> 54:17.583
Even though ye hide

54:17.683 --> 54:20.625
in the secret places of the Earth,

54:20.725 --> 54:24.916
ye shall be found out
for the last judgement.

54:25.016 --> 54:27.340
Come with me. Repent!

54:46.350 --> 54:47.791
Morning, Sarge. Anyone in yet?

54:47.891 --> 54:50.875
A few. Most of the night duty
staff have only just left.

54:50.975 --> 54:52.666
Cost a fortune in overtime, it will.

54:52.766 --> 54:54.083
Well, there you are, boy.
Just relax and get rich.

54:54.183 --> 54:57.166
Oh, the lift's out of order. When the
power failed, it blew a fuse or something.

54:57.266 --> 54:59.465
I'm liable to do the
same in this heat.

55:11.850 --> 55:14.750
- Another cyclone, in Greece.
- Another one, or the same one?

55:14.850 --> 55:16.750
Casualties aren't quite so high.

55:16.850 --> 55:19.257
Boy! Greece, Italy, France and us.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.791
We're still along the
old man's same line.

55:21.891 --> 55:24.051
- Mr Maguire, ask him to follow it through.
- Yes, sir.

55:27.641 --> 55:29.875
Jacko says will you follow
this through, Mr Maguire?

55:29.975 --> 55:32.125
- Thank you. Did he send any Benzedrine?
- Benzedrine?

55:32.225 --> 55:33.625
Skip it. Get me a
cold drink, will you?

55:33.725 --> 55:35.750
If I'm asleep when
you fetch it, nudge me.

55:35.850 --> 55:37.708
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

55:37.808 --> 55:40.333
If Le Bourget is out, try one
of the private flying clubs.

55:40.433 --> 55:43.541
Or get them by road to Brussels.
We've got to have those pictures.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.257
Yes, they'll get a credit.

55:46.683 --> 55:49.791
No, I don't want the small roads,
just the main highway diversions.

55:49.891 --> 55:52.041
Paris Match has got pictures
as it crossed the Seine.

55:52.141 --> 55:54.041
- When do we get them?
- A couple of hours, with luck.

55:54.141 --> 55:56.666
It almost wrecked Le Bourget.
The other airports are jammed.

55:56.766 --> 55:58.208
We'll need a photo news extra.

55:58.308 --> 56:00.000
I hope nobody kicks about the price.

56:00.100 --> 56:03.000
Photo news. Bill, there's an
extra page going out.

56:03.100 --> 56:04.860
Hi, Jacko. Like the
old Blitz days, isn't it?

56:04.891 --> 56:06.371
Where the hell were
you all yesterday?

56:06.433 --> 56:08.353
You may remember there
was a mist that covered...

56:08.433 --> 56:09.541
You may remember that
was in the afternoon.

56:09.641 --> 56:12.166
I wasn't drunk, and I wasn't drinking,
if that's what you're suggesting.

56:12.266 --> 56:14.541
I'm suggesting wherever you were
you'd have been of more use here.

56:14.641 --> 56:16.958
It so happens, I made a new contact
at the Met Centre yesterday...

56:17.058 --> 56:18.541
- Anything usable?
- Not yet.

56:18.641 --> 56:20.291
Anyway, Bill Maguire knew
where to reach me all day.

56:20.391 --> 56:23.007
Unfortunately Bill Maguire
doesn't pay you, Peter.

56:23.600 --> 56:25.000
No, sir.

56:25.100 --> 56:27.416
Hello, Mr Stenning.
What about that cyclone?

56:27.516 --> 56:29.875
- First one ever in Europe. Did you know that?
- I do now. Thank you.

56:29.975 --> 56:31.083
They had a whirlwind in Greece, too.

56:31.183 --> 56:33.166
Give me that, or you'll have
one right up your backside.

56:33.266 --> 56:35.708
- It's not very cold. The fridge packed up.
- You've been here all night?

56:35.808 --> 56:38.041
Oh, don't ask. I'm still recovering.
Any damage up your end?

56:38.141 --> 56:39.791
A few windows broken.
It just skirted us.

56:39.891 --> 56:41.371
Still. At least it
blew the mist away.

56:41.391 --> 56:43.751
- Why don't you blow yourself?
- Oh, don't sort the kid out.

56:43.808 --> 56:45.666
- The temperature's not his fault.
- Yes, it's not my fault.

56:45.766 --> 56:47.625
- Oh, shut up!
- All right, all right.

56:47.725 --> 56:49.500
Why does the whole world
have to drink this stuff?

56:49.600 --> 56:51.541
I understand there was organised
chaos here last night.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.750
The old man put the edition
forward one hour to beat the fog.

56:53.850 --> 56:56.333
Comes the cyclone, a complete
change-up with only half-staff.

56:56.433 --> 56:57.965
Oh, it's bloody hot.

56:58.141 --> 57:00.333
98 degrees on the Air Ministry roof.

57:00.433 --> 57:03.041
Think of all those WAAFs stripped
to the fuselage. What's this?

57:03.141 --> 57:06.208
Library clips. Cyclones, typhoons,
hurricanes. It's all there.

57:06.308 --> 57:08.958
West Pacific, northern Australia,
Madagascar, Bay of Bengal.

57:09.058 --> 57:12.833
List the figures for me, will you? Rate
of advance, acceleration and casualties.

57:12.933 --> 57:16.833
Why don't I just do 500 steaming words
on how mankind is so full of wind

57:16.933 --> 57:20.333
- it's about to out-blow nature.
- Yeah, fine. But after you've done my figures.

57:20.433 --> 57:21.708
Yes, of course.

57:21.808 --> 57:24.674
- Oh, give me those ice floe figures, will you?
- Ice floe?

57:25.600 --> 57:27.291
You mean you didn't
go to the Met Centre?

57:27.391 --> 57:29.208
Oh, those. Yes, I went.
I dropped Jeannie off.

57:29.308 --> 57:32.668
All right, all right. She's the new contact.
Works there. She's calling them through.

57:32.766 --> 57:34.632
You, of course,
were too busy to get them.

57:34.891 --> 57:36.375
She only has to look up the files,

57:36.475 --> 57:38.515
I thought it more important
to be here this morning.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.416
- Not to me, it isn't.
- Apparently.

57:40.516 --> 57:43.076
Well, you'll be glad to hear I've
just about had the whole issue.

57:43.225 --> 57:45.257
That's up to you, chum.

57:48.391 --> 57:52.424
Okay, so the knife's
penetrated deep. Can I go now?

57:53.683 --> 57:55.299
Oh, sit down, Pete.

57:55.808 --> 57:58.715
Give her a ring.
Our switchboard's probably jammed.

58:02.350 --> 58:03.882
Get me the Met Centre, please.

58:07.058 --> 58:09.083
- Could I speak to you for a moment, Sandy?
- Oh, not now, Pete.

58:09.183 --> 58:10.208
It won't take a minute.

58:10.308 --> 58:13.340
Look, all I want to do is finish
this lot and get some sleep.

58:15.683 --> 58:17.666
- I wanna turn it in.
- Do what?

58:17.766 --> 58:20.086
- Turn in my job, jack it in, resign.
- I can't stop you...

58:20.141 --> 58:22.833
Look, I am sick of being the ass
end of Bill Maguire's donkey.

58:22.933 --> 58:24.250
Why don't you leave it till
the temperature drops.

58:24.350 --> 58:26.250
- We're all a little edgy.
- I'm like a cub reporter here!

58:26.350 --> 58:27.916
"Phone up for figures,
run down to the library,

58:28.016 --> 58:29.336
"take these pictures." What am I?

58:29.391 --> 58:30.750
You're getting paid
for it, aren't you?

58:30.850 --> 58:32.416
Look, it's not so long ago,
this paper put out posters

58:32.516 --> 58:34.041
telling the public to read my stuff.

58:34.141 --> 58:36.708
And you stopped writing it,
so how could we go on printing it?

58:36.808 --> 58:39.791
Look, Pete, I'll forget you resigned.
Give it a few days.

58:39.891 --> 58:41.500
Anyway, I thought Bill Maguire
was a friend of yours.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.299
- Yeah.
- He always behaved like a friend.

58:44.433 --> 58:46.715
- Sanderson.
- Yeah, maybe it's the heat.

58:47.183 --> 58:48.590
For you.

58:51.766 --> 58:53.132
Think about it.

58:53.850 --> 58:54.958
Yeah, I will.

58:55.058 --> 58:56.208
Stenning, who's that?

58:56.308 --> 58:58.708
It's Jeannie. Pete,
I've got to talk to you.

58:58.808 --> 59:02.632
It's serious. I can't, not on the phone.
I've got to see you.

59:02.891 --> 59:05.000
You will tonight, remember?

59:05.100 --> 59:07.100
Well, if it's that urgent,
hop a cab and come here.

59:07.141 --> 59:10.833
I can't. I'm in a telephone box
and I've got to get back.

59:10.933 --> 59:12.708
Listen, I'll take an early lunch.

59:12.808 --> 59:15.257
12:30, Battersea Park.
The restaurant by the boating lake.

59:15.641 --> 59:17.090
All right, Jeannie.

59:17.225 --> 59:19.833
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah, it's a new contact

59:19.933 --> 59:20.973
I found at the Met Office.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.666
She, seems to have
something on her mind.

59:22.766 --> 59:24.166
Met Office? Has she got a story?

59:24.266 --> 59:26.041
Well, frankly, I don't think
she'd notice a news story

59:26.141 --> 59:28.291
if it was in 72-point. Still,
I don't think we should ignore it.

59:28.391 --> 59:29.951
- Well, she's your contact.
- All right.

59:30.016 --> 59:32.750
But you're my witness for the defence
when Stenning's found missing again.

59:32.850 --> 59:35.007
What are you, a cub reporter?
Go on, get out.

59:44.766 --> 59:47.875
Well, of all people. It must
be three hours since we met.

59:47.975 --> 59:49.416
There's too many people here.

59:49.516 --> 59:51.715
Who's shy? I only want to kiss you.

59:52.391 --> 59:54.151
Look, Pete, I mustn't
be seen talking to you.

59:54.183 --> 59:55.500
I know, you're a Russian spy.

59:55.600 --> 59:56.916
All right, I'll come
to Moscow with you.

59:57.016 --> 59:59.041
Oh, Pete, please be serious.

59:59.141 --> 01:00:00.461
Never more so. Come on, tovarish.

01:00:00.558 --> 01:00:02.375
- But you don't understand...
- So, you're going to tell me.

01:00:02.475 --> 01:00:04.208
Now, get in the carriage. Go on.

01:00:04.308 --> 01:00:06.382
No expense spared with Stenning.

01:00:11.391 --> 01:00:13.757
Well, what could be more private?

01:00:19.225 --> 01:00:23.174
- Pete, I...
- Take your time, I bought a double ride.

01:00:23.766 --> 01:00:25.840
- Have you got a cigarette?
- Sure.

01:00:29.183 --> 01:00:31.000
This morning, half of
the girls didn't get in,

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.333
so some of us had to go
on the switchboard again.

01:00:33.433 --> 01:00:34.541
And?

01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:36.625
Well, I've overheard things before.

01:00:36.725 --> 01:00:39.375
Sometimes you can't help it,
but you keep it to yourself.

01:00:39.475 --> 01:00:41.708
A switchboard is very confidential,
especially a government...

01:00:41.808 --> 01:00:43.382
But this morning?

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.632
You've got to promise
me you won't use this.

01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:49.382
Is it about the big question mark?

01:00:49.766 --> 01:00:51.541
- Then how can I promise?
- You must.

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:52.833
Oh, for God's sake, Jeannie.

01:00:52.933 --> 01:00:55.541
If something's gone wrong, don't you
think people are entitled to know?

01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:58.458
The people at the top are cleverer than
we are. They know what they're doing.

01:00:58.558 --> 01:01:01.333
- Then why tell me?
- Because I had to tell someone or bust.

01:01:01.433 --> 01:01:03.666
I thought you were the one person
I could tell. Maybe I was wrong.

01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:06.674
No, you weren't wrong,
Jeannie. Now, go on.

01:01:08.516 --> 01:01:12.875
I didn't understand very much of it,
but what I did understand...

01:01:12.975 --> 01:01:14.250
I don't know, I panicked
and called you.

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:15.840
So, here I am.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.132
I want your promise.

01:01:20.183 --> 01:01:21.549
All right. Let's have it.

01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:31.583
Got it! All right, all right. May!

01:01:31.683 --> 01:01:33.458
Two hot lagers for the Daily Sketch.

01:01:33.558 --> 01:01:35.125
You're lucky, I've got
two nice ones on ice.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:36.958
No, you haven't. I just sold them.

01:01:37.058 --> 01:01:39.583
I told you to hang onto those
in case Mr Maguire wanted them.

01:01:39.683 --> 01:01:41.523
- I never heard you.
- You never hear anything.

01:01:41.558 --> 01:01:44.208
- You can't keep ice in this weather.
- No. Three hot Scotch's.

01:01:44.308 --> 01:01:46.916
Good for the circulation.
Personal not professional.

01:01:47.016 --> 01:01:49.549
- There you are, Mr Maguire.
- Thanks, May.

01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:52.416
I need you, Dad, and you
need that, so drink it.

01:01:52.516 --> 01:01:54.257
Put them on the slate, May, will you?

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.375
I heard a funny story on my
way to the park this morning.

01:01:59.475 --> 01:02:00.715
How funny?

01:02:01.808 --> 01:02:03.128
What's the nutation of the Earth?

01:02:03.225 --> 01:02:07.125
Nutation? Well, it's a slight
oscillation on the Earth's axis.

01:02:07.225 --> 01:02:09.583
It's caused by the pull of the
sun and the moon on the Equator.

01:02:09.683 --> 01:02:10.708
It's changed.

01:02:10.808 --> 01:02:12.916
You see, there's a
slight bulge on the...

01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:15.166
There's also an item here
about axis rotation.

01:02:15.266 --> 01:02:17.250
There's been an 11 -degree variation,
whatever that may mean.

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:20.208
- Where'd this come from?
- Never mind where it came from. Translate it.

01:02:20.308 --> 01:02:22.799
- It means I was right.
- Well, congratulations.

01:02:23.225 --> 01:02:25.382
They've shifted the
tilt of the Earth.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.590
The stupid, crazy,
irresponsible bastards!

01:02:31.183 --> 01:02:32.507
They've finally done it.

01:02:36.516 --> 01:02:38.416
That's the normal angle of tilt.

01:02:38.516 --> 01:02:42.382
An 11-degree variation would
put it this way, or there.

01:02:42.766 --> 01:02:45.083
- We don't know whether it's east or west.
- No.

01:02:45.183 --> 01:02:48.083
Your weather line theory would
indicate an east-to-west tilt.

01:02:48.183 --> 01:02:49.375
Where did you get
this story, Stenning?

01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:51.541
I prefer you not to ask, sir.

01:02:51.641 --> 01:02:54.416
Get me Sir John Kelly,
either at his office or at his home.

01:02:54.516 --> 01:02:55.996
Wherever he is I want to talk to him.

01:02:56.016 --> 01:02:57.041
Does this come from your new contact?

01:02:57.141 --> 01:03:00.208
Never mind where it comes from.
You take my word, that's the story.

01:03:00.308 --> 01:03:03.250
What can it do to us, Bill, apart
from altering the Earth's climates?

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:07.375
Monkeying around with nature on this scale,
who knows what the implications are.

01:03:07.475 --> 01:03:08.840
Well, what do you think?

01:03:09.266 --> 01:03:10.615
I prefer not to.

01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:14.965
Yes? I didn't ask for the PRO.

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:16.833
- All right, put him through.
- Who is it?

01:03:16.933 --> 01:03:18.174
- Holroyd, sir.
- Holroyd.

01:03:18.433 --> 01:03:20.208
Get Jacko in. Get everybody in.

01:03:20.308 --> 01:03:24.049
Holroyd, this is Jefferson,
the editor of the Daily Express here.

01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:28.416
Yes, well, you can tell Sir John that he
has the choice of being disturbed now

01:03:28.516 --> 01:03:30.166
or when he reads his morning paper.

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:32.666
We're going to print
whether he talks or not.

01:03:32.766 --> 01:03:36.458
Bill, get moving. I want a pictorial
panorama of the world as it's going to be

01:03:36.558 --> 01:03:38.878
with the new climatic zones
and all the rest of it changed.

01:03:38.975 --> 01:03:41.590
Stenning, come in on this phone.
Take this down.

01:03:41.975 --> 01:03:46.340
Sir John Kelly, Jefferson here.
I'd like a statement and I'd like it now.

01:03:46.850 --> 01:03:51.590
Nothing's impossible. Not even an
11-degree tilt in the globe's axis.

01:03:52.225 --> 01:03:54.882
Yes, that's precisely what
we're going to print.

01:05:02.183 --> 01:05:04.840
Mornin', sir.
What about all this, then?

01:05:04.975 --> 01:05:08.882
"World tips over."
Fog, cyclone and flood?

01:05:21.641 --> 01:05:24.458
- Jeannie, what else could I do?
- I don't want to hear, I don't want to know.

01:05:24.558 --> 01:05:27.198
It had to come out, Jeannie.
You couldn't sit on a thing like this.

01:05:27.225 --> 01:05:28.583
That's right, that's right.

01:05:28.683 --> 01:05:31.500
But we didn't use your name, Jeannie.
Nobody used your name.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.250
Who cares about my name? My name's
nothing, it's my trust you've used.

01:05:35.350 --> 01:05:37.007
All right, I'm ready.

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:39.291
- Who are you?
- I'm a security officer.

01:05:39.391 --> 01:05:40.791
Now, wait a minute.
Where are you taking her?

01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:42.531
For the moment,
into preventative custody.

01:05:42.558 --> 01:05:44.590
- For what?
- Can we go now, please?

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:46.875
What the hell are you preventing?
It's happened, man!

01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:48.215
You've got the head weathercock

01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:50.375
sitting on the biggest addled egg
the human race has ever laid.

01:05:50.475 --> 01:05:52.291
Leave us alone, Pete. It's none
of your business any more.

01:05:52.391 --> 01:05:54.750
You let these bloody bombs off as
though they were four penny squibs

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.375
on bonfire night, and you
want to keep it a secret!

01:05:57.475 --> 01:06:00.166
Fine, fine. So they stick the
kid into preventative custody.

01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:02.458
Oh, cool off. I know
it's hot, but cool off.

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:05.833
Never mind the data on leukaemia
or infant mortality or strontium g,

01:06:05.933 --> 01:06:07.791
or any of the other clinical
facts of mass suicide.

01:06:07.891 --> 01:06:09.958
Just stick some kid in a cell and
everything will be all right.

01:06:10.058 --> 01:06:11.416
Go on, write about it like that.

01:06:11.516 --> 01:06:13.500
Oh, sure, now they want
to read about the filthy,

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.125
self-destructive force
humanity carries around

01:06:16.225 --> 01:06:18.708
rotting in its belly.
Now, when it's too late.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.833
It's never too late for a
good story well written.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:23.166
The human race has been
poisoning itself for years

01:06:23.266 --> 01:06:25.541
with a great big smile
on its fat face.

01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:26.801
Well, that's how it is, Pete.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:28.958
People don't care about the
news until it becomes personal.

01:06:29.058 --> 01:06:33.083
Well, it has become personal for me.
Isn't there anything you can do?

01:06:33.183 --> 01:06:35.291
What else is there to do?
I've made my will.

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.916
Look, Pete, they're just a bit
hysterical like the rest of us.

01:06:38.016 --> 01:06:40.333
- They'll let her out in a few days.
- Let her out to do what?

01:06:40.433 --> 01:06:44.208
- Who's gonna give her a job?
- No problem there, we'll give her a job.

01:06:44.308 --> 01:06:46.965
While it all still lasts, we might
as well have full employment.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:00.708
I felt it necessary
to speak to you all,

01:07:00.808 --> 01:07:04.208
if only to stop the many wild
and irresponsible rumours

01:07:04.308 --> 01:07:07.215
precipitated by a
general lack of facts.

01:07:08.016 --> 01:07:12.257
There has indeed been a displacement
in the direction of the polar axis.

01:07:12.558 --> 01:07:15.590
But it is not a catastrophe,
nor is it the millennium.

01:07:16.308 --> 01:07:19.041
Geologists and astronomers
have long had evidence

01:07:19.141 --> 01:07:21.833
that the tilt of the Earth has
been altered more than once

01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:26.007
in the history of its evolution,
and it has survived them all.

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:29.424
Now, what does this mean
to us in our daily lives?

01:07:30.433 --> 01:07:32.750
Well, some of the seasons,
as we know them,

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:35.250
may be disturbed and
change their intensity.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.708
This displacement has undoubtedly
brought some regions

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:42.757
nearer to the polar circle,

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.715
whilst others have been
carried further from it.

01:07:50.683 --> 01:07:54.041
But I have the utmost confidence
the world's scientists

01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:58.965
can produce solutions for any of the
climactic problems we are likely to meet.

01:08:00.183 --> 01:08:03.333
I know that many of you are
blaming the combined effects

01:08:03.433 --> 01:08:07.549
of nuclear tests for this disturbance
to the motion of the Earth.

01:08:08.850 --> 01:08:11.583
I must tell you that the majority
of the world's scientists

01:08:11.683 --> 01:08:14.132
deny that this is the cause.

01:08:14.808 --> 01:08:19.041
However, I would be failing in my
duty if I did not admit to you

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.381
that there are many others
who believe it could have been.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:26.381
But whatever the rights,
or whatever the wrongs,

01:08:26.515 --> 01:08:30.625
the four major powers have now
reached unconditional agreement

01:08:30.725 --> 01:08:32.916
to cease all further tests,

01:08:33.015 --> 01:08:38.000
experiments, manufacture
and work on nuclear projects.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.457
What they'll do to get votes.

01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:43.840
I ask you now to face the future
calmly and constructively,

01:08:43.975 --> 01:08:46.500
remembering that here
in Britain, at least,

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.416
the weather is something we
are used to coping with.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:50.707
I wonder who writes his punch lines.

01:08:50.808 --> 01:08:53.582
The old boy will need all the laughs
he can get if this heat keeps up.

01:08:53.683 --> 01:08:55.791
No, leave it on, May.
Let's hear the forecast.

01:08:55.890 --> 01:08:57.457
Yes, it's always so right.

01:08:57.558 --> 01:09:01.041
I wouldn't mind the heat if this stupid
old fool would remember to order the ice.

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.875
- I did order it.
- Well, where is it?

01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:04.916
I don't deliver it, May.

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:06.375
It's real bikini weather, May.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:08.082
Yeah, give the boys a treat, May.

01:09:08.183 --> 01:09:11.250
I don't know. All this heat's making
you lot behave like foreigners.

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:13.310
No point in holding a hot glass.
Have another one.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:15.041
No, I'm going back to the office.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.924
With a probable rise
towards the weekend.

01:09:19.808 --> 01:09:21.291
What's on your mind?

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.071
Do you think Jeff would
give me an advance?

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.549
Depends how much.

01:09:24.808 --> 01:09:26.416
However much it'd cost
to get her a good lawyer.

01:09:26.515 --> 01:09:29.041
Oh, stop worrying. She'll only
be in for a week, two at most.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.207
They're just going
through the motions.

01:09:30.308 --> 01:09:32.166
But she didn't break
the story, Bill, I did.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:34.041
If they're gonna charge
anyone, it should be me.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.082
Look, you brought in the
beat of the century...

01:09:36.183 --> 01:09:37.750
- Covent Garden!
- Enjoy it.

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:39.832
- What is it, Dick?
- The whole lot's as dry as a bone.

01:09:39.933 --> 01:09:41.799
They think it's all going up.

01:09:57.808 --> 01:09:59.715
All right, clear way!

01:11:01.725 --> 01:11:03.625
Please keep the roads clear.

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:05.465
Clear the roads, please.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.750
Keep out of the roads.
Don't cause obstructions, please.

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:12.500
Keep the roads clear.
Please keep the roads clear.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.465
Clear the roads, please.

01:12:31.558 --> 01:12:35.882
This is the editorial floor.
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

01:12:36.266 --> 01:12:37.583
Is this where I work?

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:39.583
Through the newsroom and
down into the library.

01:12:39.683 --> 01:12:42.791
By the way, I'd better warn you about
some of these newsroom characters.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.811
- I'm a big girl now.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

01:12:44.891 --> 01:12:46.125
Mr Maguire, if you ever want

01:12:46.225 --> 01:12:48.083
- any extra water...
- Never drink it.

01:12:48.183 --> 01:12:50.833
I mean I've got a contact.
Five-gallon drum only costs a pound.

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.708
Great, we'll celebrate
with two iced Cokes.

01:12:52.808 --> 01:12:54.625
- They're fetching four bob apiece now.
- Are they?

01:12:54.725 --> 01:12:58.924
- I'll get them as soon as I drop these.
- Tell them they're bloody robbers!

01:13:00.308 --> 01:13:02.750
Relax, he's out on a date,
if that makes any difference.

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:04.291
Not to me, it doesn't.

01:13:04.391 --> 01:13:07.511
Look, Jeannie, you can't go on blaming
him for blowing that story you gave him.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:08.916
Can we change the subject?

01:13:09.016 --> 01:13:10.916
No journalist would
have any right not to!

01:13:11.016 --> 01:13:13.500
I agree. Tell me, do I
always come in this way,

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.250
or is there some sort of
tradesman's entrance?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:16.916
Yes, I'll mind my own business.

01:13:17.016 --> 01:13:21.382
Now, these are the legal
gentlemen the brothers prodnose.

01:13:21.558 --> 01:13:22.750
This is the chief bunch here.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:25.958
Jacko, Miss Craig,
library and standby switchboard.

01:13:26.058 --> 01:13:27.541
- Hello and welcome.
- Thank you.

01:13:27.641 --> 01:13:30.000
All I can say is whoever took your
press pictures ought to be fired.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.666
What's the lead? "Hospital
emergency water trucks rammed."

01:13:32.766 --> 01:13:34.541
- Yeah, they grabbed 5,000 gallons.
- Marvellous, isn't it?

01:13:34.641 --> 01:13:36.500
I can remember when
it used to be money.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.458
I must say, this is
all a bit frightening.

01:13:38.558 --> 01:13:40.583
Nothing to worry about,
unless you own a reservoir.

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:42.683
- No, I meant the job.
- Oh, you'll get numb to it.

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:45.583
The chief librarian's a nice guy.
He'll put you right.

01:13:45.683 --> 01:13:48.965
If there's any special problem,
there's always me, or Pete.

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:52.875
Everything's filed here,
from the atom bomb to Zen Buddhism.

01:13:52.975 --> 01:13:57.000
Well, I appreciate the motive, but don't try
and restart anything. It's very, very over.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.541
Oh, break down, Jeannie.
What, do you want him

01:13:58.641 --> 01:14:01.081
in the penitents parade,
walking barefooted down Fleet Street?

01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:03.833
- I don't want him anywhere.
- This is no time to waste time.

01:14:03.933 --> 01:14:06.090
Well, he isn't wasting it.
He's out on a date.

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:08.507
In Battersea Park with his kid.

01:14:09.391 --> 01:14:10.757
Miss Craig.

01:14:11.183 --> 01:14:13.882
- You found your way?
- Mr Maguire brought me.

01:14:14.391 --> 01:14:17.000
Yes, I shouldn't think we'd
ever be lonely down here now.

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.500
Look after her, Archie.
She's a bright girl.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:22.424
It's just her sense of
proportion that's a bit bent.

01:14:25.183 --> 01:14:27.875
Here we are. Eight shillings
worth of deliciously hot Coke.

01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:29.590
Take that to Miss Craig, will you?

01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:31.041
What's the matter, kid?

01:14:31.141 --> 01:14:33.299
Oh, I'm all right, sir.

01:14:33.766 --> 01:14:35.750
Holy smoke, look at
these temperatures!

01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:39.041
Mexico delta, 145.6
degrees Fahrenheit.

01:14:39.141 --> 01:14:41.541
USA, Texas, 141 .3.

01:14:41.641 --> 01:14:43.375
Rome, 139.

01:14:43.475 --> 01:14:45.595
This famine death count's
pretty terrifying, isn't it?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.040
I just don't get this lack of water.

01:14:47.058 --> 01:14:48.916
What about all this extra
polar ice that's melting?

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:50.576
Well, the heat's taking
it up as vapour.

01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:52.458
Yeah, but doesn't it come
down again sometime?

01:14:52.558 --> 01:14:55.757
It does. And when it does,
pray you're on high ground?

01:14:59.308 --> 01:15:00.590
Hi.

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.174
All right, no hi.

01:15:03.558 --> 01:15:06.416
- Dave, I just came from Battersea Park...
- Personally, I prefer Brighton.

01:15:06.516 --> 01:15:08.958
Look, something's going on.
If you're not interested, to hell with it.

01:15:09.058 --> 01:15:11.458
Unwind, for God's sake.
How do I know if I'm interested?

01:15:11.558 --> 01:15:12.750
What sort of something?

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.416
Well, they're putting up long sheds,
you know, the army type.

01:15:15.516 --> 01:15:18.166
And there's trucks full of
piping and shower bath fittings.

01:15:18.266 --> 01:15:20.666
500 gallon water tanks complete
with purifying systems...

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.958
- Battersea Park?
- Yeah. And Hyde Park, Richmond,

01:15:23.058 --> 01:15:25.166
Wimbledon, Highgate, Hampstead...
Most of the open spaces.

01:15:25.266 --> 01:15:26.708
- You've seen them?
- Only Battersea,

01:15:26.808 --> 01:15:27.958
but I talked to one of the drivers.

01:15:28.058 --> 01:15:30.416
In the last few days he's delivered
similar gear to the others.

01:15:30.516 --> 01:15:32.250
- For what?
- I don't know, I never got that far.

01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:35.083
- The foreman came up shouting, "Security!"
- Any ideas?

01:15:35.183 --> 01:15:38.000
- Yes. Community washing centres.
- Good God.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.791
Why, you got ugly neighbours?

01:15:39.891 --> 01:15:42.291
If that's right, it means there'll
be no more private water at all.

01:15:42.391 --> 01:15:45.708
Correct. Just turn on your taps and
hear the rude noise of progress.

01:15:45.808 --> 01:15:47.958
This is Davis. You got any
photographers down there?

01:15:48.058 --> 01:15:49.840
Well, push them up here fast.

01:15:50.058 --> 01:15:53.708
Mitchell, get on the Glasgow office. I want
a list of any similar sites in Scotland.

01:15:53.808 --> 01:15:55.625
- You, Manchester.
- Right.

01:15:55.725 --> 01:15:57.666
Tell them to check all main
towns north of Birmingham.

01:15:57.766 --> 01:16:00.500
Bill, have a go at the ministries.
You might surprise something out of them.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.840
If I do, they'll surprise
something out of me.

01:16:04.141 --> 01:16:07.291
And what about us messenger boys?
Are we allowed to jump around a bit, too?

01:16:07.391 --> 01:16:09.916
You've jumped, haven't you? You've
probably brought in a hell of a beat.

01:16:10.016 --> 01:16:12.666
- But I'm not capable of writing it.
- Oh, relax, for...

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:16.924
This is Davis, sir. Stenning's brought in
a lead to something that could be big.

01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:20.166
Well, it looks like they're
about to cut all running water.

01:16:20.266 --> 01:16:22.786
Yeah, but I'd like him to talk to
you before he writes anything.

01:16:23.725 --> 01:16:27.340
Well, they seem to be putting up
community showers in all the parks.

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:30.757
All right, I'll send him in.
Pete! Go tell the old man.

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:33.166
Well, we're getting pictures...

01:16:33.266 --> 01:16:35.500
What about the hospitals?
Well, try them.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.458
If it's going to happen,
they're bound to know about it.

01:16:37.558 --> 01:16:39.541
They'll have made
special arrangements.

01:16:39.641 --> 01:16:42.291
And if anything comes through
on the tapes, let me know.

01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:44.916
- You actually saw these showers?
- About 50 of them at the Battersea Hut.

01:16:45.016 --> 01:16:47.083
I wouldn't like you to make
guesses about things like this,

01:16:47.183 --> 01:16:48.458
there's too much
panic about as it is.

01:16:48.558 --> 01:16:50.250
Sorry, Clive Macreedy on
the phone from Moscow.

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.150
- Moscow?
- It's urgent. It's a very bad line.

01:16:52.183 --> 01:16:54.333
A wonder it got through at all.

01:16:54.433 --> 01:16:57.424
Clive? Hello? Clive?

01:16:57.933 --> 01:16:59.924
Yes, I can't hear you.

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:02.590
Yes.

01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:07.840
Yes, I've got it.

01:17:08.266 --> 01:17:10.000
I only wish I didn't believe it.

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.507
I expect you'd like to come home now.
Is anything still flying?

01:17:13.808 --> 01:17:15.791
Well, it's up to you.

01:17:15.891 --> 01:17:17.590
You can if you wish.

01:17:22.766 --> 01:17:24.332
Shall I get on with it?

01:17:29.391 --> 01:17:31.083
- Conference, fast!
- Right, sir.

01:17:31.183 --> 01:17:32.590
Jacko!

01:17:32.766 --> 01:17:35.625
Conference! Jacko,
where the hell are you?

01:17:35.725 --> 01:17:38.257
- Yes, sir?
- In here! Get a move on!

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:40.791
Miss Evans, get the old man.

01:17:40.891 --> 01:17:43.051
I think he's at Cherkley,
but wherever he is, find him.

01:17:43.141 --> 01:17:45.041
- Yes, Mr Stenning.
- Do you want me to wait?

01:17:54.308 --> 01:17:55.757
You have a family, don't you?

01:17:57.058 --> 01:17:58.299
I have a son.

01:18:00.058 --> 01:18:01.541
I'd get him to the
country if you can.

01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:03.791
I don't think things in the cities
are going to be too pleasant.

01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:05.750
- I brought the dummy in case...
- Oh, you can tear that up.

01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:07.549
On the direct line.

01:18:09.266 --> 01:18:10.708
Good evening, sir.

01:18:10.808 --> 01:18:13.541
Well, the Russians have just
about topped everything.

01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:15.666
Macreedy got through from Moscow.

01:18:15.766 --> 01:18:19.965
They held an international press conference.
Had their top scientists present.

01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:23.333
They say that those two bangs
did more than alter the tilt.

01:18:23.433 --> 01:18:25.632
They made an 11-degree
shift in our orbit.

01:18:28.183 --> 01:18:30.674
And we're moving towards the sun.

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:35.416
Well, I can't see what
they'd gain by making it up.

01:18:35.516 --> 01:18:38.083
They say Western scientists
have known about this all along,

01:18:38.183 --> 01:18:40.583
but were trying to work something
out before they broke it.

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:42.916
It's not through on the agencies yet,

01:18:43.016 --> 01:18:45.090
but it's bound to be any moment.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.132
No, of course not.

01:18:47.516 --> 01:18:50.049
No, that's the way I
was going to play it.

01:18:50.558 --> 01:18:53.132
I'll have it put through to you.

01:18:57.183 --> 01:18:59.083
Anyone want a recap,
or did you get it?

01:18:59.183 --> 01:19:01.208
We got it, but what the
hell do we do with it?

01:19:01.308 --> 01:19:05.041
To start with, it's two lines of
120-point across eight columns.

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:07.791
I'm not up on my sci-fi.
So, we're orbiting toward the sun.

01:19:07.891 --> 01:19:10.882
- But how many billion light years...
- If that's true,

01:19:11.183 --> 01:19:14.924
I'd say there's about four months.

01:19:15.558 --> 01:19:16.924
Before what?

01:19:17.225 --> 01:19:21.132
Before there's a delightful smell in
the universe of charcoaled mankind.

01:19:21.266 --> 01:19:22.708
Do you really mean four months?

01:19:22.808 --> 01:19:26.257
According to the temperature rises
in the last few weeks, yes.

01:19:27.183 --> 01:19:29.916
- So that's the message, is it?
- About another 300 deadlines.

01:19:30.016 --> 01:19:31.576
Is that what we say
in tomorrow's paper?

01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:32.875
Tomorrow we report the news.

01:19:32.975 --> 01:19:35.666
The facts. We leave prophecy
to the street corner cranks.

01:19:35.766 --> 01:19:38.833
Bill, you and Sandy, start arranging
interviews with top scientists.

01:19:38.933 --> 01:19:41.458
Cockcroft, Penny, if you can,
get a call through to Calcutta,

01:19:41.558 --> 01:19:43.208
Haldane might break silence.

01:19:43.308 --> 01:19:45.833
Pete, you get busy on
the "no water" angle.

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:49.125
Everything affected, sanitation,
electricity, power plants...

01:19:49.225 --> 01:19:51.041
- Even down to car radiators.
- Will do.

01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:54.458
And keep the tone of the paper
reasonably optimistic. Understand?

01:19:54.558 --> 01:19:56.715
It's going to be all right.
That's it.

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:59.416
- Sir, there's an agency flash!
- Yes, we just had it.

01:19:59.516 --> 01:20:01.840
In every possible way.

01:20:06.183 --> 01:20:08.049
My home, please.

01:20:08.516 --> 01:20:09.875
What's it all mean?

01:20:09.975 --> 01:20:12.208
I was going on holiday next month.
Do you think I should cancel it?

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.708
Only thing to cancel is your life
insurance. Sell up and have an orgy.

01:20:14.808 --> 01:20:16.916
- Nice public-spirited advice.
- Oh, do me a favour.

01:20:17.016 --> 01:20:18.083
Can't anything be done, Mr Maguire?

01:20:18.183 --> 01:20:19.791
Yes, there's something
you can do right away.

01:20:19.891 --> 01:20:21.375
Pop off to the library.
Bring me everything

01:20:21.475 --> 01:20:23.435
- they've got on melting points.
- Melting points?

01:20:23.516 --> 01:20:27.500
Yes. The temperatures at which everything,
from steel to my glass eye, starts to melt.

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.666
Right.

01:20:28.766 --> 01:20:30.840
I suppose it couldn't be a mistake.

01:20:31.516 --> 01:20:34.632
It is. The daddy of all mistakes.

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:38.250
Funny how, when the chopper falls,
everyone just accepts it.

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:40.208
What else, when it's
your neck under it?

01:20:40.308 --> 01:20:41.791
A fellow up in Leeds
says he's found a method

01:20:41.891 --> 01:20:44.208
of extracting water
from the atmosphere.

01:20:44.308 --> 01:20:46.465
Oh, as it were, he's been certified.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.500
Jeff said to get the kid out of town.
It might be a bit easier in the country.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.708
Yes, it might.

01:20:51.808 --> 01:20:53.333
Couldn't get my old woman
away from her garden.

01:20:53.433 --> 01:20:54.791
She's got about six
tonnes of sweet peas.

01:20:54.891 --> 01:20:57.090
She'll be out buying black
market water for them.

01:20:57.308 --> 01:21:00.458
Which reminds me, this is highly
illegal, too. Do you want a swig?

01:21:00.558 --> 01:21:02.333
- No thanks.
- Quite right.

01:21:02.433 --> 01:21:04.416
I suppose they'll do something,
won't they, Bill?

01:21:04.516 --> 01:21:05.583
What?

01:21:05.683 --> 01:21:06.833
Well, something!
They've gotta do something.

01:21:06.933 --> 01:21:08.750
They can't just let... Let...

01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.500
- You've got a piece to write, haven't you?
- I know what I'd like to write.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.750
You can't. It's a family newspaper.

01:21:12.850 --> 01:21:14.916
We're all so bloody clever
at outsmarting nature!

01:21:15.016 --> 01:21:16.916
"Anything you can
split I can split better."

01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:18.833
- You know what I'd do if I were you?
- What?

01:21:18.933 --> 01:21:20.853
Some special data waiting
for you in the library.

01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:25.965
Half an hour ago, I brought her.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.250
Thanks. Well, in that case,
we'll just skip the library.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.541
- If you take my advice...
- You know she hasn't spoken to me since.

01:21:30.641 --> 01:21:33.465
Well, how the hell can she speak
to you in separate rooms?

01:21:34.225 --> 01:21:35.590
Well...

01:21:37.433 --> 01:21:39.465
I need some data anyway.

01:21:40.266 --> 01:21:41.632
Yeah.

01:21:43.558 --> 01:21:45.465
We all need whatever we can get.

01:21:45.891 --> 01:21:47.458
You see, they're all cross-filed.

01:21:47.558 --> 01:21:49.041
You have to remember
what names are connected

01:21:49.141 --> 01:21:50.958
with what subjects and vice versa.

01:21:51.058 --> 01:21:52.799
Anytime you want any help...

01:21:55.891 --> 01:21:57.715
I'm just getting
Mr Maguire's stuff, sir.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:02.965
Well, thanks.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.333
- Yes?
- I need some...

01:22:08.433 --> 01:22:10.090
Pete...

01:22:10.266 --> 01:22:11.715
I need you, Jeannie.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.007
I need you, too.

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:49.715
Attention, please. Attention, please.

01:22:50.016 --> 01:22:52.875
There will be an emergency
announcement of national importance

01:22:52.975 --> 01:22:55.715
by the Prime Minister
at 9:00 tonight.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:23:00.257
Stand by at 9:00 tonight for an
announcement of national importance.

01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:03.882
Please pass on this information.
Attention, please.

01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:07.541
Attention, please. There will
be an emergency announcement

01:23:07.641 --> 01:23:11.882
of national importance by the
Prime Minister at 9:00 tonight.

01:23:12.058 --> 01:23:16.299
Stand by at 9:00 tonight for an
announcement of national importance.

01:23:22.266 --> 01:23:23.840
Attention, please.

01:23:24.225 --> 01:23:27.208
There will be an emergency
announcement of national importance

01:23:27.308 --> 01:23:29.924
by the Prime Minister
at 9:00 tonight.

01:23:30.391 --> 01:23:32.250
Stand by at 9:00 tonight...

01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:34.875
I'm sorry, sir, no entry.
You better close this, chum.

01:23:34.975 --> 01:23:37.500
- I'm meeting someone inside.
- Not during ration hours.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.958
Yeah, but anyone inside will
have to come out this way.

01:23:40.058 --> 01:23:42.291
- No, don't say...
- It's no use arguing.

01:23:42.391 --> 01:23:44.000
You can't take those in,
leave them here.

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.875
- No, I want to save half my shower, see?
- You can't take water from here,

01:23:46.975 --> 01:23:48.458
this is a washing centre.
The forms, please.

01:23:48.558 --> 01:23:49.708
I don't dig it, doll.

01:23:49.808 --> 01:23:51.375
I mean, we're all entitled
to so much water, aren't we?

01:23:51.475 --> 01:23:53.083
Yeah, for washing. Leave them here.

01:23:53.183 --> 01:23:55.583
- So who says if it goes over us or in us?
- Move on.

01:24:03.141 --> 01:24:05.090
Either leave or get out of line.

01:24:05.683 --> 01:24:09.674
Attention, please. There will
be an emergency announcement.

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:16.632
Stand by at 9:00 tonight.

01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:26.257
- Daddy, you weren't there!
- Oh, they wouldn't let me in, son.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.625
- We're driving away now into the country.
- I know, Mike.

01:24:29.725 --> 01:24:32.000
I wanted us to say good-bye
to the ghost train.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.416
Well, there isn't time now,
and anyway, it's closed up.

01:24:34.516 --> 01:24:36.250
Will it be open again sometime?

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:37.924
Yeah, maybe sometime.

01:24:38.475 --> 01:24:40.882
Mummy's here. Come and see Mummy.

01:24:41.933 --> 01:24:44.791
You can come with us.
You come with us, Daddy.

01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:46.882
Make Daddy come with us, Mummy.

01:24:50.183 --> 01:24:52.250
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Angie.

01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:54.090
Why can't Daddy come with us?

01:24:55.558 --> 01:24:58.083
Somebody's gotta stay and report it
when the ghost train starts again.

01:24:58.183 --> 01:25:01.090
- We'd want to know that, wouldn't we?
- I suppose so.

01:25:01.766 --> 01:25:03.208
You're staying in London?

01:25:03.308 --> 01:25:05.007
Paper goes on forever.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.590
When will I see you again?

01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:12.166
Quite soon. I'll come out and
visit you. Now, go on, off you go.

01:25:12.266 --> 01:25:13.750
I want to sit in front!

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:16.382
All right, but don't
wriggle the whole time.

01:25:17.516 --> 01:25:19.882
I think we ought to
leave now, Angela.

01:25:21.183 --> 01:25:23.299
- Good-bye, Peter.
- Good-bye, Angie.

01:25:27.058 --> 01:25:29.375
- You got water in those cans?
- We saved a little.

01:25:29.475 --> 01:25:31.458
I'd keep to the main roads.
The water gangs are pretty busy.

01:25:31.558 --> 01:25:33.382
I won't take chances.

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.549
Good luck, Peter.

01:25:36.308 --> 01:25:38.965
It all seems pretty
ridiculous now, doesn't it?

01:25:39.683 --> 01:25:43.799
- Yeah, pretty ridiculous. Look after the kid.
- Yeah. See you.

01:25:45.725 --> 01:25:47.132
Maybe.

01:25:56.641 --> 01:25:58.250
Attention, please.

01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:01.208
There will be an emergency
announcement of national importance

01:26:01.308 --> 01:26:03.799
by the Prime Minister
at 9:00 tonight.

01:26:38.016 --> 01:26:40.090
This is London.

01:26:41.266 --> 01:26:42.375
Try and get it clearer.

01:26:42.475 --> 01:26:44.333
Nothing much I can do, sir.
We're using every known cut-out.

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.875
What do you bet they'll have another
power failure in the middle of it?

01:26:46.975 --> 01:26:48.833
It's all right, sir. We're running
on our own generator now.

01:26:48.933 --> 01:26:52.215
- It'll have to wait for the agency copy!
- Ronnie, hop over to PA and wait for it.

01:26:53.475 --> 01:26:54.965
Well, go on.

01:26:55.308 --> 01:26:57.375
I feel that at this time,

01:26:57.475 --> 01:27:01.174
it is senseless to minimise
the gravity of our situation

01:27:01.558 --> 01:27:04.291
or to deny the danger of
the course decided upon.

01:27:05.558 --> 01:27:07.007
Keep it quiet, please.

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:10.625
Perhaps it is comforting to know

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:13.916
the decision has been taken
jointly by all governments

01:27:14.016 --> 01:27:19.000
and heads of state throughout the
globe acting in complete accord.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.465
Bravo. It's only taken
half a million years.

01:27:22.308 --> 01:27:24.174
He's shaking like a jelly.

01:27:24.391 --> 01:27:26.125
What's the matter with his tongue?
It's all swollen.

01:27:26.225 --> 01:27:28.215
All right, try and get a doctor.

01:27:28.683 --> 01:27:32.257
Drastic conditions
demand drastic action.

01:27:32.808 --> 01:27:36.924
Scientists are unanimous that
we must attempt to change,

01:27:37.183 --> 01:27:40.458
or at least check,
the movement towards the sun.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:48.208
And so, all thermonuclear bombs,
the largest ever devised,

01:27:48.308 --> 01:27:51.958
will be detonated simultaneously,
100 miles apart,

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:54.007
in the west of Siberia.

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.125
And to this end, they have been
working with all possible speed

01:28:01.225 --> 01:28:05.007
before conditions of heat
make assembly uncontrollable.

01:28:06.308 --> 01:28:10.291
No one, and I repeat,
no one, can tell us exactly

01:28:10.391 --> 01:28:13.090
what this massive
explosion will effect.

01:28:13.933 --> 01:28:15.882
One thing is certain, however.

01:28:16.141 --> 01:28:18.799
Without it, we are a doomed planet.

01:28:20.516 --> 01:28:24.965
With it, we can only place ourselves
in the hands of the Almighty.

01:28:34.183 --> 01:28:36.541
- You just missed the good news.
- I heard it on the PA.

01:28:36.641 --> 01:28:38.958
- Here's the full speech. Official release.
- When's the big bang?

01:28:39.058 --> 01:28:41.938
Wednesday, 11:00 a.m. They've gotta
have their tea break first, you know?

01:28:41.975 --> 01:28:44.541
- I don't think that's humourous.
- Don't you? Well, try this for a laugh.

01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:47.250
There's five cases of typhus in North
London, and they're expecting more.

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.583
- Typhus?
- Yes, from black market water, mostly.

01:28:49.683 --> 01:28:51.875
£4 a gallon. Typhus, no extra charge.

01:28:51.975 --> 01:28:54.799
- What happened, kid?
- Don't touch him, any of you! Keep away.

01:28:55.141 --> 01:28:57.458
- Where does he live?
- Live? I don't know, North London some...

01:28:57.558 --> 01:29:00.375
That's what I thought.
Call emergency. Get an ambulance.

01:29:00.475 --> 01:29:01.625
I'll get it.

01:29:01.725 --> 01:29:04.750
Poor little bastard.
This is all we needed.

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:07.375
You'll have to see your staff's
inoculated before anyone leaves.

01:29:07.475 --> 01:29:10.541
Of course. At least we have a
choice now... Typhus or leukaemia.

01:29:10.641 --> 01:29:12.833
What do you think, Bill?
The bombs, I mean.

01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:14.013
You heard what the PM said.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.833
No one, not even Bill Maguire
can answer that one.

01:29:16.933 --> 01:29:19.541
- And if it doesn't work?
- Evacuation by spaceship.

01:29:19.641 --> 01:29:22.458
All aboard for the moon. You want
the best dead planets, we are them.

01:29:22.558 --> 01:29:24.541
- Want a slug?
- Please.

01:29:24.641 --> 01:29:27.541
If that's your last will and testament,
don't forget to leave me my car.

01:29:27.641 --> 01:29:29.625
I'm degutting the
polluted water pedlars.

01:29:29.725 --> 01:29:31.166
Give us martial law and
we'll shoot the gits.

01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:34.924
Plus the £12 I paid for my water
circulator I haven't even seen.

01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:36.791
- Do you want some?
- I'm off it.

01:29:36.891 --> 01:29:39.958
So I've noticed. It's a beautiful
thing to watch a woman reform a man.

01:29:40.058 --> 01:29:41.500
Only needed the Earth to catch fire.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.750
Glad you approve. Well, if you've exhausted
your repertoire of amusing quips,

01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:46.666
I'll go and collect the other
half of the reform movement.

01:29:46.766 --> 01:29:48.625
- She's gone.
- Gone?

01:29:48.725 --> 01:29:50.583
Yes, she'd collected
enough water for a bath,

01:29:50.683 --> 01:29:52.958
and she was going to have it
before you turned it into coffee.

01:29:53.058 --> 01:29:56.757
- Can I use the car?
- Surely. I've forgotten how to drive it.

01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:05.833
There you are, Jacko.
Read all about it.

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:07.916
Including the carbons.
Slash what you want. I'm going home.

01:30:08.016 --> 01:30:10.291
- Home?
- Yes, I've done enough work for one lifetime.

01:30:10.391 --> 01:30:12.000
- But you have to be injected.
- Against what?

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:13.549
The end of the world?

01:30:23.933 --> 01:30:26.416
Keep moving, please, down to
the embankment. The road's closed.

01:30:26.516 --> 01:30:27.625
Can I get back on at the other end?

01:30:27.725 --> 01:30:30.583
- Not tonight. This district's out of bounds.
- For medical reasons?

01:30:30.683 --> 01:30:32.875
No, there's some teenage
kids kicking it up a bit.

01:30:32.975 --> 01:30:35.333
They lit a few fires,
looted a bit of water.

01:30:35.433 --> 01:30:37.541
- Where are you going, sir?
- Embankment terrace.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:39.333
- Okay, let this one through!
- Thanks.

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:40.916
If you see any of them, keep driving.

01:30:41.016 --> 01:30:42.936
- They're either drunk or drugged.
- Great party.

01:30:42.975 --> 01:30:45.166
And stay clear of Chelsea.
They say it's pretty rough down there.

01:30:45.266 --> 01:30:46.875
It always was, wasn't it?

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.424
Yee-hoo!

01:31:45.558 --> 01:31:47.333
What do you think you're doing?

01:31:47.433 --> 01:31:50.708
We're makin' a great clean end, man.
Real cool, clean finish.

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:16.958
I want to throw this lot over
on the stinky little cow.

01:32:17.058 --> 01:32:18.833
This what you've been
saving up for, darlin'?

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.674
- Give me that...
- No, I wanna do it!

01:32:20.933 --> 01:32:22.924
All right, that's enough!
Now get out!

01:32:24.891 --> 01:32:26.424
Pete!

01:32:28.266 --> 01:32:30.840
Saving up for a last little
bath together, were you?

01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:34.757
I wanna bath him! I wanna
bath him! I wanna bath him!

01:32:34.975 --> 01:32:36.340
I wanna bath him!

01:32:39.725 --> 01:32:41.882
I wanna bath him! I wanna bath him!

01:32:59.308 --> 01:33:00.715
Did they hurt you?

01:33:02.016 --> 01:33:03.708
No, it's nothing. You?

01:33:03.808 --> 01:33:05.882
It was time I hit something.

01:33:07.725 --> 01:33:09.007
Come on.

01:33:14.016 --> 01:33:16.132
I'll go and barricade that door.

01:33:19.475 --> 01:33:22.424
- They've all gone insane.
- Yeah, it's the new fashion.

01:33:24.141 --> 01:33:26.382
Did you hear the speech?

01:33:28.266 --> 01:33:29.791
I heard.

01:33:29.891 --> 01:33:32.049
Why did this all have
to happen, Pete?

01:33:36.433 --> 01:33:38.090
It just had to, that's all.

01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:40.958
We're all too smart.

01:33:41.058 --> 01:33:42.541
All people want to do is live.

01:33:42.641 --> 01:33:44.257
I don't think so.

01:33:44.558 --> 01:33:46.000
I wish I could understand why.

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.750
A lot of people don't want
to live. It's too difficult.

01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:50.541
They're tired, they're frightened.

01:33:50.641 --> 01:33:54.215
They'd rather it was all over than
go on worrying, being frightened,

01:33:54.391 --> 01:33:56.840
losing a bit more hope every day.

01:33:56.975 --> 01:33:58.840
So they want it to finish.

01:33:58.975 --> 01:34:00.424
But I don't.

01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:02.507
I don't want it to.

01:34:02.725 --> 01:34:04.507
Neither do I...

01:34:05.183 --> 01:34:06.424
Now.

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.500
The time is now 10:41.

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.007
19 minutes before countdown.

01:34:17.225 --> 01:34:18.840
19 minutes.

01:34:21.433 --> 01:34:23.507
The time is now 10:46.

01:34:24.016 --> 01:34:26.166
14 minutes before countdown.

01:34:26.266 --> 01:34:27.757
14 minutes.

01:34:28.558 --> 01:34:30.674
14 minutes before countdown.

01:34:30.975 --> 01:34:33.090
You are advised to stay inside.

01:34:33.558 --> 01:34:36.007
The time is now 10:47.

01:34:37.308 --> 01:34:39.549
The time is now 10:51.

01:34:39.808 --> 01:34:41.632
Nine minutes before countdown.

01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:43.840
Nine minutes.

01:34:46.141 --> 01:34:48.299
The time is now 10:52.

01:34:48.475 --> 01:34:50.549
Eight minutes before countdown.

01:34:55.558 --> 01:34:57.916
"The boy stood on the burning deck
whence all but he had fled..."

01:34:58.016 --> 01:35:01.083
Hi, children. They fled to the machine
room where the booze is hidden.

01:35:01.183 --> 01:35:02.458
But not the deck boy?

01:35:02.558 --> 01:35:04.674
He has an assignment. See you.

01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:08.250
Where are you going?

01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:10.708
To see what happens after
the man says, "Zero".

01:35:10.808 --> 01:35:12.541
Eyewitness account of whether
we're coming or just wind...

01:35:12.641 --> 01:35:15.750
- Bill, let me cover it.
- No, Pete.

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:17.125
The time is now 10:56.

01:35:17.225 --> 01:35:18.750
Oh, take her home to bed, you idiot.

01:35:18.850 --> 01:35:20.791
Four minutes before countdown.

01:35:20.891 --> 01:35:23.916
If we can make it to Harry's and
down it in three and a half minutes,

01:35:24.016 --> 01:35:25.799
I'll buy you both a drink.

01:35:28.633 --> 01:35:30.375
I got something, then!

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:32.541
Can't think what you want
to listen in for, anyway.

01:35:32.641 --> 01:35:36.208
It's a historic occasion, May. It's like
the Queen's speech on Christmas Day.

01:35:36.308 --> 01:35:38.458
Just a lot of numbers,
that's all you'll hear.

01:35:38.558 --> 01:35:40.708
Don't see what's historic
about someone counting.

01:35:40.808 --> 01:35:43.166
All right, open the safe!
What've you got left, May?

01:35:43.266 --> 01:35:46.382
Oh, I'm so glad. It's so nice
to have someone in the club.

01:35:46.891 --> 01:35:49.291
In exactly 30 seconds from now.

01:35:49.391 --> 01:35:50.965
30 seconds.

01:35:51.391 --> 01:35:54.583
I've been saving this.
And this one's on the house.

01:35:54.683 --> 01:35:57.500
Take it easy now, May.
That half bottle cost a fortune.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.875
How I ever got to be manageress

01:35:58.975 --> 01:36:01.625
to a mean old bastard
like you, I'll never know.

01:36:01.725 --> 01:36:03.333
You've never said
anything like that before.

01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:07.007
No, but I've thought it and now I've
said it, and I'm glad. There's yours.

01:36:07.683 --> 01:36:09.757
Countdown must have started by now.

01:36:10.058 --> 01:36:11.507
Drink up, then.

01:36:13.433 --> 01:36:14.458
Here's how.

01:36:14.558 --> 01:36:16.299
22...

01:36:17.725 --> 01:36:19.132
21...

01:36:19.308 --> 01:36:21.215
To the luck of the human race.

01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:24.424
18...

01:36:25.808 --> 01:36:27.382
17...

01:36:41.225 --> 01:36:43.049
12...

01:36:44.016 --> 01:36:45.424
11...

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.965
Mustn't lose count.
Must be about nine.

01:36:49.641 --> 01:36:50.666
Seven...

01:36:50.766 --> 01:36:52.583
It's always later than you think.

01:36:52.683 --> 01:36:54.299
Six...

01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:56.882
- May.
- Five...

01:36:57.058 --> 01:36:59.590
- I'm here.
- Four...

01:36:59.850 --> 01:37:02.257
- Did you mean all that piffle?
- Three...

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:05.549
- Of course I didn't, you silly old berk.
- Two...

01:37:07.558 --> 01:37:09.715
- One...
- Bill, let me.

01:37:10.058 --> 01:37:12.007
Zero.

01:37:17.725 --> 01:37:19.840
All right, go on, you bloody idiot.

01:37:27.016 --> 01:37:30.340
So man has sown the wind
and reaped the whirlwind.

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.833
Perhaps, in the next few hours,
there will be no remembrance of the past

01:37:34.933 --> 01:37:37.674
and no hope for the future
that might have been.

01:37:38.266 --> 01:37:41.458
All the works of man will be
consumed in the great fire

01:37:41.558 --> 01:37:43.424
out of which he was created.

01:37:43.683 --> 01:37:45.916
But perhaps at the heart
of the burning light

01:37:46.016 --> 01:37:48.125
into which he has thrust his world,

01:37:48.225 --> 01:37:53.049
there is a heart that cares more for him
than he has ever cared for himself.

01:38:24.891 --> 01:38:29.049
And if there is a future
for man, insensitive as he is,

01:38:29.516 --> 01:38:32.299
proud and defiant in
his pursuit of power,

01:38:32.850 --> 01:38:35.215
let him resolve to live it lovingly,

01:38:35.475 --> 01:38:37.590
for he knows well how to do so.

01:38:38.725 --> 01:38:43.049
Then he may say once more,
truly the light is sweet,

01:38:44.058 --> 01:38:47.257
and what a pleasant thing it is
for the eyes to see the sun.
