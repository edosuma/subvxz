00:08.293 --> 00:10.292
Previously, on Get Shorty...

00:10.298 --> 00:12.472
You want me to stay out
of your way, I'll do it.

00:12.703 --> 00:14.702
But just know that everything I'm doing,

00:14.703 --> 00:16.702
all I'm going through right now
is so that you can tell people

00:16.703 --> 00:18.702
what Emma's dad does for a living.

00:18.703 --> 00:20.702
- Can you just give this to Emma?
- It's in LA.

00:20.703 --> 00:22.702
Acting lessons are a
bit limited around here.

00:22.703 --> 00:24.011
We'll talk about it later.

00:24.059 --> 00:26.702
We can move forward with the
movie and Amara's not involved.

00:26.703 --> 00:28.702
She doesn't know she's not involved.

00:28.703 --> 00:29.703
Just don't mention it.

00:29.704 --> 00:31.702
No. You want to hide it from her?

00:32.704 --> 00:34.702
I tell you I love the script.

00:34.703 --> 00:38.702
What did you do? You push me out.

00:38.703 --> 00:41.703
- No.
- That's not what Rick tell me.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.703 --> 01:10.702
Okay, well, is there a
time where he is reachable?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.702
- Get off the phone.
- Hold on.

01:12.703 --> 01:14.023
Well, does he check his messages?

01:17.703 --> 01:19.702
Yeah, okay. Tell him I'll
call him back. Thank you.

01:19.703 --> 01:22.702
The hell is this?

01:22.703 --> 01:23.703
Whoa. Jesus.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.702
If I can't trust you,
you're a fuckin' liability.

01:26.703 --> 01:28.702
I don't... All right.
Whatever this is about...

01:28.703 --> 01:32.702
This is about me telling
you not to call Amara.

01:32.703 --> 01:34.702
And I didn't.

01:34.703 --> 01:38.702
Eventually, I did. Yeah, 'cause
I'm a producer. I gotta check in.

01:38.703 --> 01:41.702
Okay. Well, now you
can check in with the studio

01:41.703 --> 01:43.389
and you can tell them thanks to you.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.702
Amara's investment is now four million.

01:45.703 --> 01:46.703
- Four.
- Go on.

01:47.703 --> 01:49.702
I...

01:49.703 --> 01:51.702
Gravity Pictures didn't
offer a coproduction.

01:51.703 --> 01:53.702
And now they don't have a choice.

01:53.703 --> 01:55.702
I not gonna tell you what to say

01:55.703 --> 01:56.703
since you're the one with
experience in these matters.

01:56.704 --> 01:58.703
And managing cash is
about all you're good for.

02:00.703 --> 02:03.703
- Did Amara hit you?
- For fucks sake.

02:04.703 --> 02:06.702
She had somebody hit you?

02:06.703 --> 02:09.702
Rick, in my world if you violate
the terms of a partnership,

02:09.703 --> 02:11.702
you face the consequences.

02:11.703 --> 02:13.702
If I were you,

02:13.703 --> 02:16.702
I'd put it on a Postit and
stick it on your fuckin' forehead.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.702
Hey, honey. How's it going?

02:19.703 --> 02:22.702
We've made Amara money.
Don't forget that.

02:22.703 --> 02:23.703
I'll be okay if
we leave by noon, right?

02:23.704 --> 02:26.702
260 miles, that's four hours.

02:26.703 --> 02:27.703
I've done it in three.

02:27.704 --> 02:29.702
Going 90?

02:29.703 --> 02:30.703
Are you sure that you
don't want to stay at my place?

02:30.704 --> 02:32.702
Louis is fine with it.

02:32.703 --> 02:34.702
We're at Charlene's guest house.

02:34.703 --> 02:35.703
The showgirl?

02:35.709 --> 02:38.702
Married a lawyer now.
They live in Brentwood.

02:38.703 --> 02:39.703
Which is?

02:39.704 --> 02:41.702
Nice.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.702
Listen. You're probably gonna
be hungry when you get in.

02:44.703 --> 02:47.702
How about I take you both
out for a nice dinner?

02:47.703 --> 02:51.702
Family dinner. Sure.

02:51.703 --> 02:53.703
Yeah, yeah, family dinner.

02:54.703 --> 02:55.703
It's not a date.

02:55.704 --> 02:57.702
I promise, we'll have a
horrible fucking time.

02:58.704 --> 03:00.702
Which ones should I pack?

03:00.703 --> 03:02.702
These look exactly the same.

03:02.703 --> 03:05.702
- How is she?
- Excited.

03:05.703 --> 03:07.702
So are we allowed
to watch this class tomorrow?

03:07.703 --> 03:08.703
No parents!

03:08.704 --> 03:10.702
I don't believe we're invited.

03:10.703 --> 03:12.702
All right, see you tonight.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.702
Hello. First time here?

03:25.703 --> 03:29.702
Yeah, I gotta say, this is a
lot nicer than my old church.

03:29.703 --> 03:31.702
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

03:31.703 --> 03:34.702
- I'm Brother Kimball.
- Louis Darnell.

03:34.703 --> 03:36.702
- Good to meet you, Louis.
- The writer?

03:36.703 --> 03:40.702
No. Well, yeah. I mean,
I did write a, um...

03:40.703 --> 03:42.703
The Admiral's Mistress.

03:43.703 --> 03:45.702
Have we met?

03:45.703 --> 03:48.702
Matt Solo, I'm at
William Morris Endeavor.

03:48.703 --> 03:49.703
The tobacco company.

03:49.704 --> 03:52.702
You write comedy.

03:52.703 --> 03:55.702
I represent great writers
and this guy's script.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.702
One of the year's best reads.

03:58.704 --> 04:00.702
How's preproduction?

04:00.703 --> 04:02.702
I'm not. Well, they
brought in another writer.

04:02.703 --> 04:04.702
- Pretty common, I guess.
- Yeah.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.703
Yeah.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.702
I hope you were well compensated.

04:07.703 --> 04:09.702
Yeah, I mean...

04:09.703 --> 04:10.703
Yeah. More than scale?

04:10.704 --> 04:12.703
Scale, yeah.

04:15.703 --> 04:19.702
If you want to grab a
meal, you give me a ring.

04:19.702 --> 04:22.702
Or you can find me here.

04:22.703 --> 04:24.703
Great...

04:30.703 --> 04:34.702
Yes! Yeah! Fuck.

04:34.703 --> 04:36.703
Fuck. Whoo.

04:40.703 --> 04:42.702
I needed that.

04:42.703 --> 04:43.703
Yeah.

04:43.704 --> 04:46.702
- Water?
- Yeah, sure.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.702
Wait... No, I'm saying can you
hand me at water right there?

04:48.703 --> 04:50.702
Yeah.

04:50.703 --> 04:51.703
Thanks.

04:51.704 --> 04:54.702
Well...

04:54.703 --> 04:56.702
They're gonna need me back on set.

04:56.703 --> 04:59.703
I have to shower. Money's on the table.

05:00.703 --> 05:03.703
Okay, cool.

05:06.703 --> 05:08.703
Hey, I tell you my roommate took off?

05:10.703 --> 05:11.703
Sorry, what?

05:11.704 --> 05:14.702
My roommate split town

05:14.703 --> 05:16.702
and he actually took my rent money.

05:16.703 --> 05:18.702
You know, I'm not on the lease,

05:18.703 --> 05:20.702
they were gonna kick me
out. You believe that?

05:20.703 --> 05:22.702
Shit. That sucks.

05:22.703 --> 05:24.702
So if you hear of a place
I could crash for a while,

05:24.703 --> 05:26.702
you'd... You'd let me know?

05:26.703 --> 05:28.703
Yeah, no doubt. No doubt.

05:29.703 --> 05:31.702
How's, Lethal Limit?

05:31.703 --> 05:33.702
My God. It's amazing.

05:33.703 --> 05:34.703
I mean, it's not a big role.

05:34.704 --> 05:38.702
But, in a way it kind of is a big role.

05:38.703 --> 05:40.702
'Cause whenever I'm not on screen,

05:40.703 --> 05:42.702
the other characters are
always talking about me so...

05:42.703 --> 05:45.702
That's great.

05:45.703 --> 05:46.703
Also, I have an audition for this

05:46.704 --> 05:48.702
dope period film, The
Admiral's Mistress.

05:48.703 --> 05:51.702
Like, I probably won't get
it. The producer hates my guts.

05:51.703 --> 05:53.702
- Who?
- Rick Moreweather.

05:53.703 --> 05:55.702
I met Rick, remember?

05:55.703 --> 05:57.702
I had a good conversation with him.

05:57.703 --> 06:01.702
You think if I stopped by his
office, I could score an audition?

06:01.703 --> 06:03.702
- Listen. Bro...
- Yeah.

06:03.703 --> 06:06.702
I kinda gotta get in the
headspace of this new scene. So...

06:06.703 --> 06:08.702
Yeah, totally.

06:08.703 --> 06:11.702
I'll catch you...
I'll catch you later.

06:11.703 --> 06:12.703
Peace.

06:20.703 --> 06:21.703
And people, they keep asking me,

06:21.704 --> 06:24.702
"Hafdis. You were at the
height of your career,"

06:24.703 --> 06:28.702
"you won the Palme d'Or in Cannes"

06:28.703 --> 06:30.703
"and you just leave Hollywood?"

06:31.703 --> 06:33.702
You know what I tell them?

06:33.703 --> 06:35.702
I left because I was
tired of the bullshit.

06:35.703 --> 06:38.702
I was tired of the incompetent producers

06:38.703 --> 06:42.702
and those sycophants kissing my ass.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.703
I so get it.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.703
Yeah, good call. They're all horrible.

06:48.703 --> 06:49.703
This man though?

06:49.704 --> 06:52.702
And he didn't know he
was talking to a director.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.702
This man was talking to a stranger

06:54.703 --> 06:59.702
and he told this stranger
an incredible story.

06:59.703 --> 07:02.702
A story about joy and pain.

07:02.703 --> 07:05.702
How they are forever linked.

07:06.772 --> 07:10.702
Now that's how you find a
beating heart within a film.

07:10.703 --> 07:12.702
I thought he was a hobo.

07:14.703 --> 07:16.702
Great. Here's the
rewrite by Julian Pynter.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.702
You know his work, he's fantastic.

07:19.703 --> 07:20.703
Ooh.

07:20.704 --> 07:23.702
And obviously we'd love your
thoughts before he takes another pass.

07:23.703 --> 07:26.703
Nothing like the smell of script.

07:28.704 --> 07:32.702
We spoke about, Max Kisbye.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.702
- Yes.
- Now we need Max Kisbye

07:35.703 --> 07:39.702
because he's the only one
in Hollywood with the anger

07:39.703 --> 07:45.702
and the vulnerability we need to
create a character of this caliber.

07:45.703 --> 07:47.702
Unfortunately, he's unavailable.

07:47.703 --> 07:51.702
TMZ has photos of him at
"Morning Light" rehab clinic.

07:51.703 --> 07:53.702
Agoura Hills?

07:53.703 --> 07:56.702
Yeah. Which means he's not allowed
to have a cell phone or internet.

07:56.703 --> 07:59.702
So we could wait forever to get a read.

07:59.703 --> 08:01.702
Okay, so we look at other actors.

08:01.703 --> 08:03.303
So many brilliant ways we can go, right?

08:03.703 --> 08:06.702
Yeah. A lot of interesting
things we could do. Yeah.

08:06.703 --> 08:09.702
So you... You can
just find another actor?

08:09.703 --> 08:11.702
Yeah, why not?

08:11.703 --> 08:15.702
Okay, why don't
you find another director?

08:15.703 --> 08:20.702
I mean, if we're not having Max
Kisbye, what's the point guys?

08:20.703 --> 08:24.703
All right. I'm sure there's a
way we can swing this. Right?

08:27.703 --> 08:28.703
I'm on it.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.702
Meaning, you have a
way to get to Kisbye?

08:31.703 --> 08:33.703
Give me a day and, yeah.

08:35.250 --> 08:36.250
Yeah, I'm on it.

08:36.328 --> 08:37.328
Go mad.

08:42.703 --> 08:46.702
Go up to that guy, then press "x."

08:46.703 --> 08:47.703
I am.

08:47.704 --> 08:49.702
- X!
- I am pushing it.

08:52.703 --> 08:54.702
Don't start that mission without me.

08:54.703 --> 08:55.703
Hey, which phone is that?

08:55.704 --> 08:57.703
It's a new burner.

09:00.703 --> 09:02.702
Yeah?

09:02.703 --> 09:04.702
Josias said he gonna hear you out.

09:04.703 --> 09:06.703
- When?
- Tomorrow.

09:09.703 --> 09:11.703
You said you wanted this
shit taken care of, right?

09:13.703 --> 09:16.703
Okay. Tomorrow.

09:24.703 --> 09:25.703
Good morning.

09:25.704 --> 09:27.702
He's back.

09:27.703 --> 09:31.702
You said, "He's back"
like you're surprised.

09:31.703 --> 09:35.569
And if that's because they got a
new writer, I'm still helping Miles.

09:35.703 --> 09:37.703
I just meant good morning.

09:38.703 --> 09:39.703
Yeah. All right.

09:39.704 --> 09:44.703
Hey, um, how much does a
screenwriter get for a scale?

09:45.703 --> 09:46.703
For a scale?

09:46.704 --> 09:48.702
Whatever, I mean... Any scale.

09:48.703 --> 09:49.703
Depends on the budget.

09:49.704 --> 09:52.702
Midlevels, maybe low six figures.

09:52.703 --> 09:56.702
Six... A hundred grand?

09:56.703 --> 09:58.702
For a fuckin' screenplay?

09:58.703 --> 09:59.703
You think that's low?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.702
Hey, brother. You're reading.

10:05.703 --> 10:06.703
I'll let you do that.

10:08.703 --> 10:11.702
But can I ask you something?

10:11.703 --> 10:14.702
Well, you said that you were gonna
find a job for me on the movie.

10:14.703 --> 10:16.702
- So that I'm not just hanging around.
- Associate producer.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.702
I asked Rick and that's
what he recommended.

10:18.703 --> 10:20.702
I love that. What's that mean?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.703
It means that... It
means that you gonna help out.

10:24.703 --> 10:27.702
Kind of like I'm doing already?

10:27.703 --> 10:29.702
Arrogant British nob.

10:29.703 --> 10:30.703
What?

10:30.704 --> 10:32.702
This sad excuse for
a halfassed writer.

10:32.703 --> 10:34.702
Gladys, my love. Would
you happen to have on file

10:34.703 --> 10:36.702
a home address for Mister Julian Pynter?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.702
- I can get it.
- Thank you.

10:38.703 --> 10:41.702
I told the prick to add a young
girl, just a few lines for Emma.

10:41.703 --> 10:43.076
I'd do it myself only we're paying the

10:43.082 --> 10:44.702
gobshite a king's ransom already.

10:44.703 --> 10:47.702
You see now? I told you it was
bad idea to bring this guy in.

10:47.703 --> 10:50.697
Thinks he knows better,
that's what it is.

10:50.698 --> 10:53.697
But he and I are gonna
have a little chat.

10:53.703 --> 10:55.678
And if I have to fucking stand above him

10:55.684 --> 10:57.702
and supervise every fuckin' syllable,

10:57.703 --> 10:58.783
that's what's gonna happen.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.702
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.702
I'm gonna send over a courier
with a few little notes.

11:04.703 --> 11:07.702
- Want me to arrange?
- No, no, no. I'll handle it.

11:07.703 --> 11:09.702
Hold on, buddy.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.702
Hold up.

11:11.703 --> 11:14.702
If you go over there
all worked up like this.

11:14.703 --> 11:16.702
- It's not gonna go well.
- It'll go well.

11:16.703 --> 11:19.702
Let me handle it. Okay?

11:19.703 --> 11:23.702
I'll make sure he does what you
want. And I'm a little curious.

11:23.703 --> 11:25.702
About what?

11:25.703 --> 11:27.702
About how the writing thing works.

11:27.703 --> 11:29.703
- "The writing thing"?
- Yeah.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.703
Just a few lines for the
housekeeper's daughter.

11:37.703 --> 11:38.703
Okay.

11:46.703 --> 11:50.702
There he is.

11:50.703 --> 11:52.703
I can't believe it.

11:59.703 --> 12:01.703
- Well, let's... Let's sit.
- Yeah.

12:03.703 --> 12:07.702
So, how you doing?

12:07.703 --> 12:10.703
Generally or the treatment?

12:11.703 --> 12:13.702
Both.

12:13.703 --> 12:17.702
Um, yeah, been in 22
days and I feel great.

12:17.703 --> 12:20.702
They, tailor therapy to who
you are as an individual here.

12:20.703 --> 12:22.702
And the therapist has actually
been through this shit himself.

12:22.703 --> 12:24.702
Well, that's important. Good.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.702
Yeah.

12:26.703 --> 12:30.702
They told me you were here, I thought
there was a mistake.

12:30.703 --> 12:31.703
What do you mean mistake?
Of course I'm here.

12:31.704 --> 12:34.703
I just mean... you
didn't come last time.

12:35.703 --> 12:36.703
Well, I was shooting.

12:38.703 --> 12:39.743
Or the time before, but...

12:40.703 --> 12:44.702
You're here now. It means a lot.

12:44.703 --> 12:46.703
I'm sorry. I haven't been in a while.

12:47.703 --> 12:48.703
Nah, it's fine.

12:48.704 --> 12:50.703
Mom doesn't make it easy for you.

12:51.703 --> 12:53.702
We fell out of touch, it happens.

12:53.703 --> 12:55.702
I get the photos though.

12:55.703 --> 12:57.702
Aunt Martha keeps sending photos like...

12:57.703 --> 12:59.702
I keep a little scrapbook.

12:59.703 --> 13:00.703
- Yeah.
- Scrapbook?

13:00.704 --> 13:04.702
Yeah, your pictures and
your sister's pictures.

13:04.703 --> 13:07.702
But this is better, being here.

13:07.703 --> 13:08.703
It's good, yeah.

13:08.704 --> 13:10.703
Yeah.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.702
Wa... Was that...

13:14.703 --> 13:17.702
That guy that just walked
out? It looked like Max Kisbye.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.702
Yeah. He checked
in last week. But...

13:19.703 --> 13:22.703
- No kidding.
- But I'm keeping my distance.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.702
How come?

13:25.703 --> 13:28.702
Well, I'm, you know, clean and he's,

13:28.703 --> 13:30.703
relapsed like twice.

13:31.703 --> 13:32.703
Shit.

13:32.704 --> 13:36.702
So, I'm staying as far away
from him as possible.

13:36.703 --> 13:37.703
That's a good idea. Yeah.

13:37.703 --> 13:38.703
Yeah.

13:51.703 --> 13:54.702
My God.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.702
- Fiveandahalf hours?
- Fifteen was a parking lot.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.702
I mean, these maniacs drive
on the shoulder to get past.

13:59.703 --> 14:01.702
You sound like a local.

14:01.703 --> 14:03.702
God.

14:03.703 --> 14:05.702
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, Eva.

14:05.703 --> 14:07.702
It's Emma.

14:07.703 --> 14:09.702
Emma, See I knew it began with E.

14:11.703 --> 14:13.702
What happened?

14:13.703 --> 14:16.702
This? Nothing, just
some idiot rearended me.

14:16.703 --> 14:18.702
Those airbags pack a punch.

14:18.703 --> 14:20.702
- Mom, look.
- Did you get it checked out?

14:20.703 --> 14:21.703
Nah, the car was a bit much anyway.

14:21.704 --> 14:23.702
The insurance actually
paid off the lease.

14:23.703 --> 14:25.702
Not the car, I mean, you.

14:25.703 --> 14:27.703
Here, follow my finger with your eyes.

14:32.703 --> 14:34.702
Hey, you want to check
out the studio tomorrow?

14:34.703 --> 14:37.702
- Mom.
- I told Charlene we'd have lunch.

14:37.703 --> 14:38.703
Okay.

14:38.704 --> 14:40.702
We're still good to
eat now though, right?

14:40.703 --> 14:43.702
I got us a reservation in 20 minutes.

14:43.703 --> 14:45.702
A reservation?

14:45.703 --> 14:46.703
This place called the BelAir Lounge.

14:46.704 --> 14:48.702
I hear the new chef has his own TV show.

14:48.703 --> 14:50.702
So even if the food is
shite at least it's famous.

14:50.703 --> 14:53.702
I'm driving.

14:53.703 --> 14:55.702
She's driving?

14:55.703 --> 14:57.703
- Put on your seat belt.
- I will.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.703
Try this.

15:14.703 --> 15:17.703
It's from Guatemala.
Made by gringos, but...

15:21.703 --> 15:22.703
You needed me?

15:27.703 --> 15:29.703
I had them cook dinner for us.

15:31.703 --> 15:33.702
Why?

15:33.703 --> 15:37.702
No "why." I had them cook
chicken pepian.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.702
With the pepita?

15:39.703 --> 15:43.702
Sesame seeds, tomatillos, cilantro, si.

15:43.703 --> 15:45.703
Tia.

15:46.703 --> 15:47.863
Remember when you were a boy.

15:49.703 --> 15:51.703
I say it make you strong.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.703
Now look at you.

15:59.703 --> 16:03.702
Man, these dishes are crazy.
What are "frizzled leeks"?

16:03.703 --> 16:06.702
Yeah. Those are those special,

16:06.703 --> 16:09.703
seahorses in a cabbage broth.

16:11.703 --> 16:12.703
They're not.

16:12.704 --> 16:14.703
I'm so hungry that
actually sounded good.

16:16.703 --> 16:18.702
Hey, there. Desmond.

16:18.703 --> 16:19.703
We've been waiting a while now.

16:19.704 --> 16:21.702
Friday nights are busy.

16:21.703 --> 16:23.702
And there's an after-party
for the awards show.

16:23.703 --> 16:25.702
- What awards?
- Excuse me.

16:25.703 --> 16:26.703
Hi, can I get your name?

16:26.704 --> 16:28.703
Reynold. Part of two.

16:30.703 --> 16:33.703
Sorry, no smoking.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.703
But he can do that?

16:36.704 --> 16:39.702
Vaping? Yes. Mr. Reynolds.

16:39.703 --> 16:41.702
Hey. What are they eating?

16:41.703 --> 16:43.702
Um...

16:43.703 --> 16:46.702
Could be, um, spring pea
shoot and minted yogurt soup?

16:46.703 --> 16:47.703
They give you hammers.

16:47.704 --> 16:50.702
My God.

16:50.703 --> 16:52.702
They do give you hammers.

16:52.703 --> 16:54.702
What?

16:54.703 --> 16:57.702
It wasn't so pretentious last time.

16:57.703 --> 16:59.702
I love that we're here. Are you kidding?

16:59.703 --> 17:01.702
- This is amazing.
- Yeah?

17:01.703 --> 17:03.702
Yeah.

17:03.703 --> 17:05.702
Well, full disclosure...

17:05.703 --> 17:07.702
Since I've been in LA,
I only come to places

17:07.703 --> 17:08.703
where they give you little hammers.

17:08.704 --> 17:12.703
Mrs. Thomas, one moment...

17:13.703 --> 17:16.702
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Desmond. I had a reservation.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.702
And I've been patient. But if
you seat those people before us,

17:19.703 --> 17:21.702
things are gonna get
really fucking bad for you,

17:21.703 --> 17:23.702
really quickly. Do you understand?

17:23.703 --> 17:27.702
Or I've $100 in my pocket. Your call.

17:27.703 --> 17:29.702
- There's a table opening up.
- Is that right?

17:29.703 --> 17:32.702
I'll clear it and we'll seat you now.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.702
- All good.
- They're ready for us?

17:39.703 --> 17:41.703
I hear you hungry lately.

17:43.703 --> 17:44.703
What?

17:46.703 --> 17:48.703
You eat at Raleigh Pupuseria.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.703
Where'd you hear that?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.702
Is it true?

17:53.703 --> 17:55.702
Food is good. Chicharron con jalapeño.

17:55.703 --> 17:58.703
Forty miles. You drive 40
miles for chicharron?

18:00.314 --> 18:01.314
I wanted to try it.

18:01.704 --> 18:03.703
Is Josias's place.

18:04.703 --> 18:05.703
I didn't know that.

18:09.703 --> 18:10.703
You didn't know that?

18:12.703 --> 18:13.703
Um, I do now.

18:14.703 --> 18:15.703
I saw his guys around.

18:15.704 --> 18:18.702
Ooh, pepian is spicy.

18:20.703 --> 18:24.702
Josias's men. They talk to you?

18:24.703 --> 18:26.702
They said shit. I didn't listen.

18:26.703 --> 18:28.702
They talk about me?

18:28.703 --> 18:29.703
You? No.

18:31.703 --> 18:33.702
Sure?

18:33.703 --> 18:36.703
They wouldn't say shit. Believe
me, I would set them straight.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.702
We have platanos en mole.

18:44.703 --> 18:45.703
Yeah? That's great.

18:45.704 --> 18:47.703
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

19:26.703 --> 19:28.703
- Hello?
- Delivery.

19:39.703 --> 19:41.702
Script notes from Gravity Pictures.

19:41.703 --> 19:42.703
Thank you.

19:42.703 --> 19:43.703
I need you to sign.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.702
So, let me find the ol' clipboard.

19:46.703 --> 19:47.703
What? Where was...

19:47.704 --> 19:49.702
I think your wife's calling you.

19:49.703 --> 19:51.702
Excuse me?

19:51.703 --> 19:52.703
Yeah, I thought I heard someone.

19:52.704 --> 19:55.702
I certainly hope it's not
my wife since I'm divorced.

19:55.703 --> 19:57.702
Housekeeper?

19:57.703 --> 19:58.703
- No one here but me.
- Really?

19:58.704 --> 20:00.702
Here we go.

20:00.703 --> 20:02.702
There we go. Just,
sign at the top there.

20:02.703 --> 20:03.703
I need a pen.

20:05.703 --> 20:09.702
Shit. Damn it.

20:09.703 --> 20:11.703
Hold on.

20:22.703 --> 20:24.703
Jesus.

20:25.703 --> 20:26.703
Did I scare you?

20:26.704 --> 20:31.702
I just didn't want to make
you go back up to the truck.

20:31.703 --> 20:33.702
Just sign at the top, right?

20:33.703 --> 20:34.703
Whatever.

20:36.703 --> 20:37.703
Thanks again.

20:38.703 --> 20:40.703
So how's the script coming?

20:42.703 --> 20:44.702
What?

20:44.703 --> 20:46.702
Told you, I got notes from the studio.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.702
Yeah, I have them.

20:48.703 --> 20:50.702
Yeah. I know that you have them,

20:50.703 --> 20:53.702
'cause most of those notes are the
ones you got the first time around.

20:53.703 --> 20:55.702
You just need to do them

20:55.703 --> 20:58.702
and I'm here to make
sure that that happens.

20:58.703 --> 21:00.702
This is a joke?

21:00.703 --> 21:01.703
No, sir.

21:01.704 --> 21:03.702
What's your name?

21:03.703 --> 21:05.702
So do you have a home office, or
do you just work at the table there?

21:05.703 --> 21:07.702
'Cause, I mean, however you
want to do this is, you know...

21:07.703 --> 21:10.702
Who told you to come... You
know what? Doesn't matter.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.703
You need to leave.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.702
I will. As soon as you take...

21:13.703 --> 21:15.702
No, no. Get the fuck out of my
house or I'll call the police.

21:15.703 --> 21:18.702
Hey, you don't need to be like that.

21:18.703 --> 21:19.703
We're both professionals.

21:24.703 --> 21:25.783
Don't be difficult, Julian.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.702
Help! Help!

21:35.703 --> 21:38.702
You know, what? You're really
making a big deal out of this.

21:38.703 --> 21:41.702
All you have to do is take the notes.

21:41.703 --> 21:43.702
And you're a badass writer.

21:43.703 --> 21:44.703
I'll bet if you put your mind to it,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.702
you can knock this out before lunch.

21:50.703 --> 21:53.703
You don't work for the
studio. Who are you?

21:55.703 --> 21:57.703
Don't run out on me, Julian.

21:59.703 --> 22:01.702
I'll tell you what...

22:01.703 --> 22:02.703
I'm gonna put ice on your hand there,

22:02.704 --> 22:05.703
and then we're gonna get to work. Okay?

22:08.703 --> 22:09.703
Thank you, sir.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.703
Sign this?

22:18.703 --> 22:20.703
Ooh... Cool name tag.

22:29.703 --> 22:31.702
You checking out the competition?

22:31.703 --> 22:34.702
That guy over there, he's
on The Thundermans.

22:34.703 --> 22:35.703
He's a real actor.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.702
You're a real actor. You are.

22:39.703 --> 22:42.703
Welcome. Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking to?

22:43.703 --> 22:45.702
Em... Emma Daly?

22:45.703 --> 22:48.703
Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?

22:50.703 --> 22:51.703
She's got butterflies a bit.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.702
Acting is playing.

22:54.703 --> 22:56.702
Let your imagination run riot,

22:56.703 --> 22:58.703
you'll have nothing to be nervous about.

23:00.703 --> 23:02.702
Welcome, everyone. I'm Francis Knox,

23:05.703 --> 23:08.702
Now if the parents here
could please excuse us?

23:08.703 --> 23:11.702
It's time to start our work.

23:12.704 --> 23:14.703
Thank you. Thank you.

23:22.703 --> 23:26.702
So each of these cards
is a scene in the screenplay?

23:26.703 --> 23:28.702
Yes.

23:28.703 --> 23:30.702
Do the colors mean something, or...

23:30.703 --> 23:33.703
Each color is a different storyline.

23:35.703 --> 23:38.703
How do you know what
order to put 'em in?

23:41.703 --> 23:45.702
I ask myself what happens first then
what happens in reaction to that.

23:45.703 --> 23:48.702
That's a lot to figure out.

23:48.703 --> 23:50.703
It is.

23:52.703 --> 23:55.703
Hey... Did you always
want to be a writer?

24:00.698 --> 24:06.697
When I was ten, I was at a very
strict prep school in Sunningdale.

24:06.703 --> 24:08.931
The only discipline that afforded any

24:08.937 --> 24:11.702
sense of freedom was writing fiction.

24:11.703 --> 24:13.703
So I became a man of letters.

24:14.703 --> 24:17.702
What's that mean?

24:17.703 --> 24:20.702
A writer.

24:20.703 --> 24:24.702
Um, I don't mean to seem rude
but I generally find it easier

24:24.703 --> 24:26.702
to work when I'm not
engaged in conversation.

24:26.703 --> 24:30.702
Yeah, Do your thing, man.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.702
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

24:32.703 --> 24:34.703
Very kind.

24:45.703 --> 24:47.702
Can I help you?

24:47.703 --> 24:49.702
I'm Nathan Hill. I met Mr.
Moreweather a while back

24:49.703 --> 24:52.703
when he was shooting The
Hunting. Really cool guy.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.702
So I heard he's doing, this new film

24:57.703 --> 24:59.702
and I'm working on the lot today

24:59.703 --> 25:00.703
so I thought I'd stop in.

25:00.704 --> 25:03.703
Score an audition.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.702
Who's your agent?

25:06.703 --> 25:09.702
I don't actually have one.

25:09.703 --> 25:11.655
Well, the only way to get an audition on

25:11.661 --> 25:13.702
this project is through representation.

25:13.703 --> 25:16.703
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

25:18.703 --> 25:20.702
Do you need a PA?

25:20.703 --> 25:22.702
Or I could work in casting as a reader.

25:22.703 --> 25:25.702
Yeah, why don't you just
fill out this application.

25:25.703 --> 25:28.702
I'll keep it on file and I'll
let you know if anything comes up.

25:28.703 --> 25:31.702
Thank you! Very cool.

25:31.703 --> 25:33.703
Can I just take a pen?

25:34.703 --> 25:36.703
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

25:41.703 --> 25:44.702
I don't have a current address.

25:44.703 --> 25:47.702
Can I just put down my
name and cell number?

25:47.703 --> 25:48.703
Sorry.

25:48.704 --> 25:50.702
Yeah, yeah, that.

25:50.703 --> 25:52.702
Admiral's Mistress.

25:52.703 --> 25:54.702
Yeah, let me see if I can get him.

25:56.703 --> 25:59.702
Yeah, hey. No calls, okay.
I'm going to see Kevin now.

25:59.703 --> 26:00.703
It's Amara.

26:00.703 --> 26:01.703
Amara?

26:01.704 --> 26:03.702
Says she got your package.

26:03.703 --> 26:04.703
And if you're not
here, she'll call back.

26:04.704 --> 26:07.703
Package. Shit.

26:08.703 --> 26:10.702
Is Miles here?

26:10.703 --> 26:11.703
No.

26:12.703 --> 26:14.703
Okay.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.702
Amara! Hi.

26:21.703 --> 26:24.702
- Hello, Ricky.
- Hey.

26:24.703 --> 26:26.702
You tell me I'm out of
movie. But guess what?

26:26.703 --> 26:30.702
You're back in!
Yeah. How about that.

26:30.703 --> 26:33.702
- You would be sad to lose me.
- I sure would.

26:33.703 --> 26:36.702
And listen, we got a
great director, Hafdis...

26:36.703 --> 26:40.702
I can't say his last name, but
he's great. We're thrilled with him.

26:40.703 --> 26:42.702
So, when do I see the movie?

26:42.703 --> 26:44.702
You know, what? As soon
as that premiere comes out,

26:44.703 --> 26:47.702
I'm gonna personally escort
you down the red carpet.

26:47.703 --> 26:48.703
Show me Hollywood.

26:48.704 --> 26:50.702
That's right.

26:50.703 --> 26:52.703
You send more scripts?

26:53.703 --> 26:57.702
Yes, I did. I did. But that
was, That was earlier.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.702
And you're still investing
in The Admiral's Mistress.

26:59.703 --> 27:00.703
So you know, what? That stuff can wait.

27:00.704 --> 27:04.702
Ricky. I got money.

27:04.703 --> 27:06.703
You show me what you got.

27:08.703 --> 27:10.702
Well, I sent you three scripts, right?

27:10.703 --> 27:12.702
The first one is Swamp Children.

27:12.703 --> 27:15.702
It's based on a graphic novel.

27:15.703 --> 27:17.702
Miles took us out for this
fancy dinner last night.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.702
Wanted to give us a tour of the studio.

27:20.703 --> 27:21.703
He's showing you he's changed.

27:21.704 --> 27:23.702
Has he, though?

27:23.703 --> 27:25.702
Take it from a girl who used to
wear a feather bikini to work.

27:25.703 --> 27:29.703
The overnight success thing
is real. Especially, out here.

27:30.703 --> 27:33.702
Sorry, sorry.

27:33.703 --> 27:34.703
Hi.

27:34.704 --> 27:38.702
Closing went late. Buyers were
arguing over a roof replacement.

27:38.703 --> 27:40.702
It's like they have five
million for the house

27:40.703 --> 27:44.702
and they can't spare 20
grand for shingles? I mean...

27:44.703 --> 27:46.702
Nicole. Katie, guest of honor.

27:46.703 --> 27:48.702
- Hi.
- Nicole sold me the house.

27:48.703 --> 27:50.702
So what do you do, Katie?

27:50.703 --> 27:51.703
Plastic surgeon's assistant.

27:51.704 --> 27:53.702
Woman after my own heart.

27:53.703 --> 27:55.702
Buried in silicone as it may be.

27:55.703 --> 27:56.703
I couldn't tell.

27:56.704 --> 27:58.702
Please. I keep meaning
to have them replaced.

27:58.703 --> 28:00.702
Only I can't spare the recovery time.

28:00.703 --> 28:01.703
You're a C, right?

28:01.704 --> 28:03.702
My God. I love her.

28:03.703 --> 28:05.702
You know, you could
switch to a teardrop shape.

28:05.703 --> 28:07.702
Less projection, we don't
put it under the muscle.

28:07.703 --> 28:10.702
You'd be back at work in
a week and a half, tops.

28:10.703 --> 28:12.702
Better consult than Dr. Soo gives me.

28:12.703 --> 28:14.702
- Leonard Soo?
- Yes.

28:14.703 --> 28:17.702
I've been trying to get my
doctor to use his implant.

28:17.703 --> 28:19.702
Well, then I should introduce you.

28:19.703 --> 28:20.703
I would love that.

28:20.704 --> 28:23.702
Only... We're only here a few days.

28:23.703 --> 28:26.703
Well, if you ever decided to stay...

28:36.703 --> 28:39.702
- Lulu. It's great.
- Yeah?

28:39.703 --> 28:45.702
Three little scenes for Emma,
not too many lines. It's lovely stuff.

28:45.703 --> 28:49.702
I... You know, I had him read Emma's
lines out loud so I could hear 'em.

28:49.703 --> 28:53.702
You did good.

28:53.703 --> 28:54.339
Thanks, buddy.

28:54.442 --> 28:56.052
You know, I can tell
that he was working fast,

28:56.058 --> 28:57.702
'cause there's a lot of typos.

28:57.703 --> 29:00.703
Yeah, well, he only had
nine fingers to work with.

29:04.703 --> 29:07.703
No. I didn't cut anything
off. I just broke a finger.

29:08.703 --> 29:11.702
One finger. What?

29:11.703 --> 29:14.702
An Alist writer and
you broke his finger.

29:14.703 --> 29:16.703
He's not gonna tell
anyone, he was scared shitless.

29:18.703 --> 29:19.703
Come on. You know,
if you'd gone over there,

29:19.704 --> 29:22.702
you would've skinned him alive.
I saw that look in your eye.

29:22.703 --> 29:24.702
Which is why I let you handle it.

29:24.703 --> 29:26.702
You managed to deal with
that girlfriend of the writer,

29:26.703 --> 29:28.703
how the fuck did you pull that off?

29:30.703 --> 29:37.702
Lulu. Lulu. You said that you
convinced her with your words!

29:37.703 --> 29:40.702
I did convince her with my words.

29:40.703 --> 29:44.702
And then, as I was leaving,
she came at me with questions.

29:44.703 --> 29:45.703
Fuck's sake.

29:46.703 --> 29:48.702
So you took her out.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.702
And what's worse? You
lied to me about it.

29:50.703 --> 29:53.702
I didn't lie. No. I
just didn't tell you.

29:53.703 --> 29:55.702
Because your family was coming,

29:55.703 --> 29:56.703
I didn't want you to get
you all stressed about it...

29:56.704 --> 29:58.702
Much better to handle it this way,

29:58.703 --> 30:00.702
and wait till they're actually
fucking here to tell me.

30:00.703 --> 30:03.703
Jesus Christ, Lou. Do I
need to do everything myself?

30:04.703 --> 30:07.703
You know what? Fuck you.

30:09.703 --> 30:13.702
People all over this town make
movies without breaking fingers

30:13.703 --> 30:16.702
or shooting every fucker they meet.

30:16.703 --> 30:18.303
Well, you oughta work with those people.

30:18.703 --> 30:20.702
I will.

30:20.703 --> 30:22.112
Look, I know that Katie and Emma coming

30:22.118 --> 30:23.702
here is a really big deal for you.

30:23.703 --> 30:25.702
But for the good of humanity,
why don't you have a drink,

30:25.703 --> 30:28.702
get laid or go for a
run or do something.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.040
Because you have been wound tight all

30:30.046 --> 30:31.708
day and it's getting on my nerves.

30:45.703 --> 30:48.702
Noah, Emma, hop on up.

30:48.703 --> 30:52.702
Yeah. And remember, show us your EIS.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.702
Which stands for...

30:54.703 --> 30:59.703
Energy! Imagination! Sparkle!

31:00.703 --> 31:01.703
Begin.

31:01.704 --> 31:04.703
I like your wide and sassy smile.

31:05.703 --> 31:07.703
That makes me feel happy.

31:08.703 --> 31:11.702
Okay, slow start. Step it up.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.703
Really show us that imagination, Emma.

31:15.703 --> 31:16.703
Okay.

31:17.703 --> 31:19.702
I like your clean new sneakers.

31:19.703 --> 31:21.702
Better!

31:21.703 --> 31:23.702
That makes me feel pleased as punch!

31:24.704 --> 31:27.702
I love your superstylish hair.

31:27.703 --> 31:33.703
That makes me feel... Happy?

31:35.703 --> 31:38.703
Emma! That had zero sparkle.

31:39.703 --> 31:41.703
Zero!

31:42.703 --> 31:45.703
Lilah, hop on up.
Show her how it's done.

31:47.703 --> 31:48.703
Thank you, Emma.

31:50.703 --> 31:53.703
I like your wide and sassy smile.

31:58.703 --> 31:59.703
There's my superstar.

31:59.704 --> 32:02.702
Can we get out of here?
And don't call me that.

32:02.703 --> 32:03.703
Hey. Would you stop running please?

32:03.704 --> 32:05.703
I'm not running.

32:06.703 --> 32:07.703
Hey. What's wrong?

32:07.704 --> 32:09.702
I was the worst one there.

32:09.703 --> 32:11.702
What? No, you weren't.

32:11.703 --> 32:13.702
Look, I've seen you on stage
and you were bloody wonderful.

32:13.703 --> 32:15.703
Okay, I don't wanna talk about it.

32:16.703 --> 32:17.703
Shorty.

32:19.703 --> 32:22.126
- Hey, come on.
- No.

32:22.284 --> 32:23.703
Okay, it obviously didn't go well.

32:23.704 --> 32:25.702
- We can find you another...
- I don't want to be an actor.

32:25.703 --> 32:26.703
And I don't want to
be in a stupid movie.

32:26.704 --> 32:29.702
You say that way now, but...

32:29.703 --> 32:31.703
Dad, do I have to be in it?

32:32.703 --> 32:34.703
Of course not.

32:35.703 --> 32:37.703
Will you get pissed
off with me if I'm not?

32:38.703 --> 32:40.702
No.

32:40.703 --> 32:43.703
Okay. I really don't want to be in it.

32:44.703 --> 32:45.703
Fine.

32:46.703 --> 32:47.703
Let's get back.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.702
Can I watch TV?

32:54.703 --> 32:55.703
Sure.

32:56.703 --> 32:57.703
You hungry?

32:57.703 --> 32:58.703
No, not really.

32:59.703 --> 33:01.702
I got pizza.

33:01.703 --> 33:05.702
It's a couple of days old
but that adds character.

33:05.703 --> 33:07.702
Hey, where's the remote?

33:07.703 --> 33:09.703
Um, not all together sure, lad.

33:14.703 --> 33:15.703
You are pissed off.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.702
No. No, I get it.

33:19.703 --> 33:21.389
I don't know a lot about acting but

33:21.395 --> 33:23.702
it seems like an unpleasant business.

33:23.703 --> 33:26.703
People pretending to be other
people, that can't be healthy.

33:28.703 --> 33:32.702
Mom won't come to LA unless
I'm in the movie. Right?

33:32.703 --> 33:36.702
All right. Let's get one
thing straight, shall we?

33:36.703 --> 33:38.702
You were bloody wonderful in your play

33:38.703 --> 33:40.702
and you'd be amazing in the movie.

33:40.703 --> 33:42.703
That's not me speaking
as your dad but as...

33:44.703 --> 33:47.702
As a movie producer.

33:47.703 --> 33:49.238
But now on a separate
note, would like you

33:49.244 --> 33:50.702
and your mom to be with me here in LA?

33:50.703 --> 33:52.703
Of course, I would.

33:53.703 --> 33:55.703
But let's not confuse the issue.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.703
Fine.

34:00.338 --> 34:01.338
What?

34:02.703 --> 34:03.703
I'll be in the movie.

34:03.703 --> 34:04.703
No, no, no, no. That's
not what I'm saying.

34:04.704 --> 34:06.703
Just don't give me too many lines.

34:08.703 --> 34:10.702
You don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

34:10.703 --> 34:12.703
No. I said I'll do it. So,
don't talk me out of it.

34:14.703 --> 34:15.703
I won't.

34:20.703 --> 34:22.703
Francis said I don't have sparkle.

34:27.703 --> 34:28.703
No what?

34:29.703 --> 34:31.703
Found the remote.

34:36.703 --> 34:38.702
So we all... We
all have negative feelings.

34:38.703 --> 34:42.702
But the goal is to allow ourselves
to experience those feelings,

34:42.703 --> 34:45.702
without allowing it to
trigger addictive behavior.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.702
What's that?

34:49.703 --> 34:51.702
Ten minute warning.

34:51.703 --> 34:52.703
Sorry, I've been going on for hours.

34:52.704 --> 34:55.702
Hey, we're catching up.

34:55.703 --> 34:58.702
Well, before you go, tell me about
the new movie you're working on.

34:58.703 --> 35:00.702
Well, change of pace for me.

35:00.703 --> 35:02.702
- Actually it's a period thing.
- Okay.

35:02.703 --> 35:03.703
And it's funny you bring it up,

35:03.704 --> 35:06.702
'cause I was leaving the house today

35:06.703 --> 35:10.702
and I was thinking, Max Kisbye
would be perfect for this lead.

35:10.703 --> 35:12.702
He... Dead on.

35:12.703 --> 35:14.702
- Really.
- Yeah, I actually...

35:14.703 --> 35:18.702
I grabbed a copy of the
script. I know you're not...

35:18.703 --> 35:20.702
You're not tight with
him but you see him

35:20.708 --> 35:22.702
at meals or group therapy and...

35:22.703 --> 35:24.702
- Dad.
- Yeah, maybe it comes up organically.

35:24.703 --> 35:27.702
Like he's wondering what movie am
I gonna do when I get out of here.

35:27.703 --> 35:28.703
Yeah.

35:33.321 --> 35:35.321
You're incredible.

35:35.703 --> 35:37.702
What?

35:37.703 --> 35:41.702
Coming to check on me.
As if that made sense.

35:41.703 --> 35:43.702
If you don't want to
talk to him, that's fine.

35:43.703 --> 35:45.702
Don't act like you just
thought of this, this morning.

35:45.703 --> 35:46.703
First time you came here,

35:46.704 --> 35:47.735
you kept looking over my shoulder.

35:47.759 --> 35:49.393
I thought, "What's he looking for?"

35:49.399 --> 35:50.149
Not true.

35:50.219 --> 35:52.708
As if Max Kisbye would
do one of your movies.

35:58.703 --> 36:01.702
Actually has a... A
pretty decent budget.

36:01.703 --> 36:03.702
- Great director.
- You should go.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.703
Okay. Don't... Come on, don't do that.

36:09.703 --> 36:13.702
You're right, I came here to see
if you could help me with this.

36:13.703 --> 36:16.703
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit.

36:17.703 --> 36:20.702
But when I got here
and you started talking

36:20.703 --> 36:23.703
and telling me everything
that you're doing,

36:24.703 --> 36:26.703
I forgot about Max Kisbye.

36:28.703 --> 36:29.823
I was just happy to be here.

36:40.703 --> 36:42.703
All right, well...

36:45.703 --> 36:46.703
Can I get a hug?

36:55.703 --> 36:56.823
Okay, I'd like to come back.

36:58.703 --> 37:00.703
I'll leave it up to you.

37:08.703 --> 37:11.703
Take the fucking script.

37:46.703 --> 37:47.703
Knock, knock.

37:48.703 --> 37:49.703
You're the father of?

37:49.704 --> 37:51.702
Emma.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.703
Right.

37:56.703 --> 37:57.703
I'm sure you're trying
to get out of here,

37:57.704 --> 37:59.703
but do you have a quick minute?

38:01.703 --> 38:05.702
You want to know why Emma was so upset.

38:05.703 --> 38:07.702
I've been at this for a long time

38:07.703 --> 38:12.702
and if you encourage a child
who doesn't have what it takes?

38:12.703 --> 38:14.702
You're not doing them any favors.

38:14.703 --> 38:16.702
So, on her first day of
acting lessons for little kids,

38:16.703 --> 38:20.702
you made her cry. But
it was for her own good?

38:20.703 --> 38:21.703
I have an eye for talent.

38:21.704 --> 38:23.703
And she's has no
future in this business.

38:26.703 --> 38:27.703
She's 12.

38:27.704 --> 38:30.703
That's lots of time for her to
find something she's good at.

38:33.703 --> 38:37.702
God forbid, she's not made for this.

38:38.704 --> 38:40.702
She might end up in
a shithole in Burbank

38:40.703 --> 38:43.703
crushing kids dreams
for fifty bucks an hour.

38:49.703 --> 38:52.703
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait!

39:25.703 --> 39:27.702
Let's go.

39:27.703 --> 39:28.703
Shut the fuck up.

39:30.703 --> 39:31.703
Nice shirt.

41:25.703 --> 41:30.702
Which do you like better?
Marine? Or Pool Party?

41:30.703 --> 41:32.703
I'm redoing my bathroom.

41:34.703 --> 41:35.703
Pool Party.

41:38.311 --> 41:40.703
I like Marine. It's more peaceful.

41:41.703 --> 41:42.783
Are we gonna talk business?

41:47.703 --> 41:48.703
You want Amara gone?

41:54.703 --> 41:56.136
I can make that happen.

41:58.703 --> 42:00.703
This woman is family.

42:01.134 --> 42:03.078
By marriage.

42:03.703 --> 42:07.702
You'll kill your aunt,
Thanksgiving is gonna be awkward.

42:07.703 --> 42:10.702
So what's this about?

42:10.703 --> 42:13.703
Did she not give you the
keys to the station wagon?

42:14.703 --> 42:16.703
I got my own car.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.703
So get rid of her. Why come to me?

42:20.703 --> 42:23.702
It's like that Star Trek shit.

42:23.703 --> 42:25.702
The enemy of my enemy, is my friend.

42:25.703 --> 42:28.703
That's not Star Trek.

42:29.703 --> 42:31.702
It was in Star Trek.

42:31.703 --> 42:35.702
That's some Indian shit.
Some old Indian saying.

42:35.703 --> 42:39.702
Listen, I know how this works.

42:39.703 --> 42:42.703
All right? You clear shit
with Mexico, verdad?

42:44.703 --> 42:47.703
Well, I don't have the connect. You do.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.702
So what do you want?

42:54.703 --> 42:59.702
Amara's territory,
everything across the 95.

42:59.703 --> 43:02.702
Except Reno, that's your shit.

43:02.703 --> 43:06.703
And I'll kick up 10% across the board.

43:27.703 --> 43:28.703
I can walk on my own.

43:31.703 --> 43:33.703
Let me get a smoke.

43:34.703 --> 43:35.703
Smoke in the car.

43:36.703 --> 43:37.703
With a bag over my head?

43:42.703 --> 43:44.702
It's menthol.

43:44.703 --> 43:46.703
You wanna bitch or you want a smoke?

44:39.703 --> 44:40.743
Tia, I got to talk to you.

44:43.703 --> 44:44.703
Tell me.

44:44.704 --> 44:46.702
When I was at the pupuseria,

44:46.703 --> 44:49.702
one of Josias's guys came over.

44:49.703 --> 44:50.703
Said he wanted to have
a sit down with me.

44:50.704 --> 44:52.702
What did you say?

44:52.703 --> 44:55.702
I said, "Are you crazy?
Get the fuck out of here."

44:55.703 --> 44:59.702
And I didn't say nothing because
I knew you would freak out.

44:59.703 --> 45:02.702
Thinking I wasn't telling
you the whole story.

45:02.703 --> 45:05.703
But I swear to God,
that's how it went down.

45:09.703 --> 45:10.703
It's good you told me.

45:11.703 --> 45:16.703
And now, you call him back.

45:53.703 --> 45:55.702
You little bitch.

45:55.703 --> 45:58.702
I told Josias you weren't worth shit.

45:58.703 --> 46:01.703
Get your piece.

46:19.703 --> 46:21.702
Hi, Mom. We ordered Indian food.

46:21.703 --> 46:24.702
Did you?

46:24.703 --> 46:25.703
There's a curry up there
with your name on it.

46:25.704 --> 46:28.702
You look relaxed. What's that?

46:28.703 --> 46:31.702
Nicotine vape. All the rage apparently.

46:31.703 --> 46:33.703
We should head back to Charlene's.

46:34.703 --> 46:35.703
Or you could stay a while?

46:35.704 --> 46:38.702
Yeah, Mom have some food.

46:42.703 --> 46:44.702
Don't try and hate yourself, Wyatt.

46:44.703 --> 46:46.147
I'm not.

46:46.290 --> 46:48.582
I'm the same man that's wanted in three

46:48.588 --> 46:50.702
states and five territories remember?

46:50.703 --> 46:52.702
Tell me, am I...

46:52.703 --> 46:54.702
No more for me,
not if I'm gonna drive.

46:54.703 --> 46:56.703
Not yet.

46:59.703 --> 47:01.702
What are you trying to say?

47:01.703 --> 47:05.702
Nothing. It's just, Charlene called

47:05.703 --> 47:07.702
and she said that our house was on fire.

47:07.703 --> 47:10.702
Yeah, she sounded pretty distressed.

47:10.703 --> 47:12.702
Probably because of
the fire in her house.

47:12.703 --> 47:16.702
Well, nice of her to tell us.

47:16.703 --> 47:17.703
I'll see you around.

47:18.703 --> 47:20.703
What kind of business?

47:32.703 --> 47:35.702
Hey, about the bed. You may notice

47:35.703 --> 47:38.702
a quite severe dip in the
middle of the mattress.

47:38.703 --> 47:39.703
That's fine.

47:39.704 --> 47:41.702
So, Louis won't mind sleeping out here?

47:41.703 --> 47:44.702
Let's not ask him.

47:44.703 --> 47:45.703
I'll help you make up the couch.

47:45.704 --> 47:47.703
Cheers.

47:48.703 --> 47:50.703
Gosh. This place.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.702
It's classy, right?

47:53.703 --> 47:56.702
I think they call it
extendedstay chic.

47:57.703 --> 48:00.703
Bedsheets are made from
genuine boxer shorts.

48:02.703 --> 48:04.702
- Cashmere?
- I needed new clothes.

48:04.703 --> 48:06.702
Impressive.

48:06.703 --> 48:10.702
What that I... That I managed
to buy a hoodie all on my own?

48:10.703 --> 48:15.703
Less than a month, you got a
fancy job. A new place to live...

48:16.703 --> 48:17.703
And you're jealous?

48:19.703 --> 48:20.703
Little bit.

48:21.703 --> 48:26.702
Hey, I'm doing a shite job
of showing off LA so far.

48:26.703 --> 48:30.702
But I swear, Katie,
it's a hell of a town.

48:30.703 --> 48:32.703
Well, it turns out it suits you.

48:34.703 --> 48:37.702
It's just that it's a bit lonely.

48:37.703 --> 48:39.703
What about Louis?

48:40.703 --> 48:42.702
He snores.

48:42.703 --> 48:44.702
And he's a rubbish lover.

48:52.703 --> 48:53.703
Airbag?

48:54.703 --> 48:56.703
As God as my witness.

49:16.703 --> 49:19.703
Shh, Emma can't hear.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.702
Hey, Kevin, it's Dad.

49:29.703 --> 49:31.702
And, look I know they don't
let you use the phone there

49:31.703 --> 49:33.702
so you probably can't
get your messages.

49:33.703 --> 49:35.703
But, when you do get this...

49:36.703 --> 49:40.702
Um, I just...

49:40.703 --> 49:42.702
I feel shitty about today.

49:42.703 --> 49:47.702
It's... It's good to
see you doing so well

49:47.703 --> 49:49.703
and, um...

49:51.703 --> 49:54.703
Yeah, keep it up.

50:02.698 --> 50:03.698
Great, thanks.

50:03.704 --> 50:04.854
Good night.

50:04.933 --> 50:07.702
That was Scotty Walker leaving word.

50:07.703 --> 50:10.703
- Who's... Who's that?
- Max Kisbye's agent from CAA.

50:12.703 --> 50:14.702
Get him on the line.

50:14.703 --> 50:15.703
Call her.

50:19.703 --> 50:20.703
Hey, Rick Moreweather.

50:20.704 --> 50:22.702
Hello, Ricky.

50:22.703 --> 50:23.703
It's not Walker,
it's that investment woman...

50:23.704 --> 50:26.702
Okay. Okay. Thank you, Gladys.

50:26.703 --> 50:30.702
Amara, hi, wow! Boy,
I was just heading out.

50:30.703 --> 50:31.703
How are you?

50:31.704 --> 50:33.703
You gonna show me Hollywood?

50:34.703 --> 50:37.702
Sure, yes. Soon as you get to LA.

50:37.703 --> 50:39.703
When do you want to meet?

50:40.703 --> 50:41.703
What?

50:41.704 --> 50:43.703
I'm here, Ricky.

50:44.703 --> 50:45.703
What do you mean?

50:45.704 --> 50:47.702
In Hollywood.

50:47.703 --> 50:48.703
And so far...

50:49.703 --> 50:50.703
I like it.
