00:33.701 --> 00:36.402
Courtney, didn't I ask
you to do the dishes?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.109
If you don't turn that music
down, you're gonna go deaf.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.514
Or maybe you already have.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.616
Hey! Courtney!

00:50.718 --> 00:53.385
Earth to Courtney.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.887
Courtney?

00:54.989 --> 00:57.856
Honey? Oh, my God, honey?

00:57.958 --> 00:59.291
Honey?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.692
What?

01:00.795 --> 01:03.162
Honey, what is going
on, sweetheart?

01:03.264 --> 01:04.930
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:05.032 --> 01:08.200
Babe? Honey? Honey?

01:21.515 --> 01:22.881
Big test today?

01:22.983 --> 01:24.683
Yup, and I'm going to fail.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.345
Yeah, well, with that attitude.

01:26.369 --> 01:29.154
No, with this teacher.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.256
Honey, I'm sure
you're gonna do fine.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.958
You don't know <i> Senor</i> Johnson.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.562
Will you be home for
dinner tonight?

01:36.664 --> 01:39.731
- I don't think so. Things are...
- Really busy at work.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.470
Well, I'll see ya when I see ya.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.906
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

01:48.008 --> 01:51.210
I am so sorry.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.278
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.860
I should've watched
where I was going.

01:54.884 --> 01:55.914
Is everything okay?

01:56.016 --> 01:58.183
Nothing injured but
my Spanish book.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.919
Um, Steve, hang on a second.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.666
Well, if you're sure
everything's fine...

02:02.690 --> 02:04.189
It's okay, mom, you can go.

02:06.293 --> 02:09.094
- So you're in Spanish?
- Uh, yeah, I just moved here.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.863
- I'm, I'm Cara.
- Oh, I'm Summer.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.633
- Is that your mom?
- Yup.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.569
The one and only Lianne Hughes.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.405
- Let me show you around.
- That'd be great. Thank you.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.074
So where are you
moving here from?

02:22.176 --> 02:23.308
Uh, Hamilton.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.910
- Oh, what part?
- Oh, Oliver.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.712
- We moved a lot.
- Oh.

02:26.814 --> 02:27.946
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.750
So how screwed are you
guys on this test?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.719
Uh, on a scale of
from one to ten...

02:33.821 --> 02:36.054
- What's ten in Spanish?
- I don't know.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.323
I just remember the curse words.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.059
- Who's this?
- Oh, this is Cara, she's new.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.395
- Hi.
- Cara, meet Tori and Jason.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.796
<i>Diez.</i>

02:45.599 --> 02:48.066
Ten in Spanish.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.635
There goes the curve.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.771
I introduced Cara
to my car door,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.473
so now I'm showing her around.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.807
Fighting with Lianne?

02:55.910 --> 02:58.143
Oh, she's sure I can
improve my grades

02:58.245 --> 03:00.612
if only I improve my attitude.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.980
Oh, come on, give her a break.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.162
Well, sorry we can't all be

03:03.186 --> 03:04.194
mommy's perfect angel.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.018
It's too bad. You should try it.

03:06.120 --> 03:09.788
Oh, you know, I heard Alexis
is pretty close with her mom.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.357
- Here we go again.
- What's this?

03:12.459 --> 03:14.993
Oh, just one of Jason's old
flames that he hid from me.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.662
It was like two dates
two years ago,

03:16.764 --> 03:18.764
and now she's dating
Scott Carlyle.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.699
Well, at least your
mom doesn't make you

03:20.801 --> 03:22.534
apply to 22 different schools.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.436
I thought it was 21.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.038
Oh, no, she found
out North Dakota

03:26.140 --> 03:28.974
has a well-regarded
aerospace program.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.210
- How about you, Cara?
- What?

03:31.312 --> 03:34.012
What has your mom done
to horrify you today?

03:34.114 --> 03:36.348
- She isn't around.
- Oh, I totally understand.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.650
My mom works late all the time.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.719
- Like, last night...
- She died last month.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.789
Oh, that sucks.

03:43.891 --> 03:46.225
Um, what Tori meant
to say just now

03:46.327 --> 03:48.794
is that all of us are
sorry to hear that.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.529
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.864
I'm so sorry. I, I have no idea.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.968
It's okay.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.344
- Hey, knock, knock.
- Hi.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.813
Hey, here's your coffee,
as you like it.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.435
A little bit of sugar,
a dash of cream.

04:09.459 --> 04:10.882
- Thank you.
- There you go. Whoa!

04:10.985 --> 04:12.517
Did we, uh, book a
new travel account

04:12.620 --> 04:14.353
that I'm not quite
aware of there?

04:14.455 --> 04:17.856
I am trying to find a weekend
trip to take with my daughter.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.425
We used to go every year, but
money's been a little tight.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.394
Well, if we close this
Vital account this week,

04:22.496 --> 04:24.696
you are gonna have
a nice commission.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.499
That is what I am countin'
on to get caught up

04:27.601 --> 04:30.002
and get my nights and
weekends and daughter back.

04:30.104 --> 04:32.404
Yeah, you have been workin'
around the clock here.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.674
I barely see her, and when I
do, it turns into a fight.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.042
Ever since George died.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.746
Yeah. It's tough.
Single parents, like...

04:42.383 --> 04:45.217
So, um, just wanna ask.

04:45.319 --> 04:49.187
How's that, um, that-that
presentation coming?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.189
Well, I just got
the new mock-ups,

04:51.292 --> 04:52.591
so I'm updating now

04:52.693 --> 04:54.726
and I might even get out
of here on time tonight.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.595
Wait. What? Whoa, whoa, careful!

04:56.697 --> 04:58.417
Careful, you know, 'cause
people around here

04:58.441 --> 04:59.841
might think you
actually have a life

04:59.865 --> 05:00.932
outside of this place.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.167
- Really? Wow.
- Oh, yeah.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.336
Well, think umbrellas, beaches.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.444
Oh, come on, it's not so bad.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.446
Who even speaks
Spanish, anyways?

05:14.548 --> 05:16.782
Twenty countries,
plus Puerto Rico.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.951
See? You got that one right.

05:20.054 --> 05:23.088
- Oh!
- God, you almost broke my neck.

05:23.190 --> 05:24.389
Sorry.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.725
- How's it goin'?
- Uh!

05:26.827 --> 05:28.093
<i>Muy malo.</i>

05:32.032 --> 05:34.433
Um, I used to tutor
at my old school.

05:34.535 --> 05:37.302
- I can help you if you wanna.
- That would be awesome.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.604
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.606
Tonight? No, we're supposed
to hang out tonight.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.308
But I have to retake
this test tomorrow.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.510
- Tonight's good.
- Okay.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.945
What about you, Jason?
Wanna join?

05:47.047 --> 05:48.313
No, I have practice.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.749
Oh, one sport ends,
another begins.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.618
State championships
don't come in the mail.

05:53.721 --> 05:55.961
I thought you guys weren't
supposed to wear those things.

05:55.985 --> 05:57.156
Didn't Scott get his stuck in

05:57.180 --> 05:58.523
some shop equipment
or something?

05:58.625 --> 06:00.265
Yeah, but you couldn't
tell the difference

06:00.289 --> 06:01.526
in his catching.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.129
I'll just keep mine in the
truck on shop days, though.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.765
I could meet you
guys after practice.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.468
Perfect. We can
study at my house.

06:09.570 --> 06:11.470
Cara, do you need
to ask your dad?

06:11.572 --> 06:13.138
No, I don't need to ask.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.073
Lucky.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.218
Your house is so nice.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.887
- Oh, thanks!
- Meh.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.123
- Why do I hang out with you?
- You know you love me.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.357
- Oh.
- Yeah.

06:32.459 --> 06:33.870
Who used to climb
up your drain pipe

06:33.894 --> 06:35.460
and bring you trashy
magazines and candy

06:35.562 --> 06:36.573
when you were grounded?

06:36.597 --> 06:37.863
Yeah, until my mom caught you

06:37.965 --> 06:39.064
and almost called the cops.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.665
- Really?
- Yes.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.870
Lianne and I have a
complicated relationship.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.304
My mom does not like her.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.807
I'm sure she just wants
what's best for you.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.909
Well, there's nothing
she can do about it.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.310
We're official.

06:54.615 --> 06:57.082
- Summer, where's yours?
- Oh.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.151
The necklace turned
my skin green.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.520
Oh, another reason for
my mom to love Tori.

07:01.622 --> 07:04.423
Whatever. That green blotch
was a good look for you.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.059
Oh, my gosh, this is so unique.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.195
- I love it.
- Thanks, um...

07:10.297 --> 07:11.696
It belonged to a friend of mine.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.099
- Hm.
- Did you have friends back home?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.168
Tori...

07:16.270 --> 07:18.437
Ugh!

07:18.539 --> 07:20.105
- Jessica?
- Jessica.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.240
- Who's Jessica?
- My mom.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.686
She wants me back home,
she probably found

07:23.710 --> 07:25.110
some tech school in Manitoba

07:25.212 --> 07:26.678
I haven't applied to yet.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.847
- See you guys tomorrow? Bye.
- Yeah, later.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.016
- We can go study in my room.
- Okay.

07:35.456 --> 07:38.690
So Tori seems...

07:38.792 --> 07:40.859
Like a pain in the ass?

07:42.563 --> 07:44.529
Have you guys been friends long?

07:44.631 --> 07:48.500
- Since kindergarten.
- That's nice.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.303
I lost touch with a lot of my
friends after my mom died.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.076
When my dad died, I lost
a lot of friends, too.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.046
People didn't know what to say,
so they didn't say anything.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.149
Were you guys close?

08:05.486 --> 08:07.052
We were best friends.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.458
Jason seems nice.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.827
Yeah, Tori thinks he's
a total meathead,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.930
but I'm kinda crazy about him.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.132
He was there for me
when my dad died.

08:22.402 --> 08:25.270
And it was not a fun time.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.172
Most guys would've
run for the hills.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.275
You two are really cute.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.678
My mom is, like,
super photographer.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.115
Actually, to commemorate
our first day as friends

08:37.217 --> 08:38.227
with selfie.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.851
Um...

08:39.953 --> 08:42.854
I-I feel kinda gross today.
Rain check?

08:43.624 --> 08:44.923
Okay.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.793
What's this?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.796
This is <i> the</i> most
embarrassing thing ever.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.865
Ugh, when I was six,

08:53.967 --> 08:57.102
I decided I want to
be a pageant queen.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.170
So I begged my parents

08:59.273 --> 09:02.507
to let me enter in to the
Little Miss Henson Pageant.

09:02.609 --> 09:05.343
I must've practiced that Kelly
Clarkson song for weeks.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.012
That's adorable.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.682
No, because when I got on
stage and I opened my mouth,

09:10.784 --> 09:13.285
I threw up all over the judges.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.287
That's less adorable?

09:15.389 --> 09:19.157
Yeah. I was so devastated.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.892
But my mom decided
to have me perform

09:20.994 --> 09:22.627
in the living room
for her and my dad.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.396
And then she gave
me that trophy.

09:24.498 --> 09:26.798
She said she was so proud
of how hard I worked.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.534
She seems great.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.970
- Yeah.
- Summer.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.872
Oh, speaking of.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.311
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.180
- How was school?
- School-ish.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.150
- I know you.
- Mom, this is Cara.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.552
- Hi.
- From the car.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.989
I hope it didn't put a dent
in your day or the door.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.925
She just transferred here. Is it
okay if she stays for dinner?

09:54.027 --> 09:57.495
Perfect, I bought way too
much sweet-and-sour chicken.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.898
Well, Jason is coming, too.
So...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.934
I should order some more
sweet-and-sour chicken.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.236
Cara, do you need to
check with your mom?

10:05.339 --> 10:07.906
Uh, my mom passed away recently.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.775
That's why they moved here.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.878
Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.914
Oh, honey. Uh...

10:16.016 --> 10:18.350
- Mom. Seriously?
- Mm?

10:18.452 --> 10:21.586
What? Oh. Sorry.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.556
Well... who's hungry?

10:24.658 --> 10:26.302
Would you like
some more chicken?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.226
Uh, no, I'm good. Thank you.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.894
- Jason?
- If no one else wants it.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.464
Here you go.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.599
So how was your first
day at school?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.768
A whirlwind, um,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.370
but Summer was kind enough

10:38.472 --> 10:40.739
to help me find my classes
and show me the ropes.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.307
Very helpful.

10:42.409 --> 10:43.575
Maybe you can train her to be

10:43.677 --> 10:44.687
more like that at home.

10:44.711 --> 10:45.810
That seems unlikely.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.978
Uh!

10:49.082 --> 10:52.651
- Honey, how was your day?
- Not great.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.831
I got my Spanish test back.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.588
Oh. Sorry.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.090
Just a second.

10:59.192 --> 11:02.327
And my mom walked away in
the middle of a sentence.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.067
- Are you-you gonna finish that?
- No. Have at it.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.568
Good girl.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.307
See? Well, you should
be more like Cara.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.576
Hm, don't you mean
more like Alexis?

11:18.679 --> 11:20.078
- Her, too.
- Huh?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.480
- Yeah.
- Thin ice, buddy.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.582
And the way you're eating...

11:24.685 --> 11:27.786
How did we get the
wrong graphics?

11:27.888 --> 11:31.790
Oh, it's gonna take all night
to make those changes.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.859
No, it's okay, I brought
the files home.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.696
Thanks.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.200
So here <i> coche</i> is?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.969
- The indirect object.
- Right, which makes <i> ella?</i>

11:45.072 --> 11:47.005
- The direct object.
- Right.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.707
Yeah.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.008
How's it going, girls?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.043
<i>Excelente, mi madre.</i>

11:52.145 --> 11:54.212
Ah-ha, it's getting late.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.614
Oh, well, can Cara sleep over?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.016
We're still studying.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.718
Do you need to check
with your dad?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.130
It is a school night.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.487
Actually, we're not

12:02.589 --> 12:03.788
unpacked from the move yet.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.930
It would be great to sleep

12:04.954 --> 12:06.825
somewhere with pillows.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.060
Okay, I suppose that's fine.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.062
<i>Gracias,</i> Mrs. Hughes.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.864
<i>De nada,</i> my dear.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.800
<i>Ole!</i>

12:15.902 --> 12:17.368
Here, let me get
you some pajamas.

12:17.471 --> 12:18.603
Okay.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.607
Hi, Jason.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.277
Well, I miss you, too.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.781
Yeah, I wish you were here.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.423
I love you.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.425
No, I told you you can't
come over tonight.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.960
I'm with Cara.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.597
But tomorrow...

13:44.858 --> 13:46.324
Uh, thanks.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.510
- Oop! Late-night snack?
- Oh!

14:05.612 --> 14:06.978
I was just getting some water.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.347
I am so sorry, I thought
you were Summer.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.584
It's fine. Um, she let
me borrow her PJs.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.786
Mm, I bought those for her

14:14.888 --> 14:17.355
on our trip to Hawaii last year.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.024
That was, like, a long time ago.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.094
Are you wearing Coincidence?
That's my favorite perfume.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.197
Mine, too. It's what my
mother used to wear.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.366
Hm.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.869
Well...

14:32.439 --> 14:35.106
- Late night tonight?
- All night.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.543
- I'll let you get to it.
- Okay, goodnight, Summer.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.446
I am so sorry. Cara.

14:42.916 --> 14:46.384
That's okay... mom.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.785
Summer, let's go, hon.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.756
Good morning.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.592
What is this?

15:27.694 --> 15:29.327
I thought I'd make breakfast

15:29.429 --> 15:31.596
to say thank you for letting
me spend the night.

15:31.698 --> 15:34.999
- I hope you don't mind.
- Mind? Are you kidding?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.534
You didn't have to do this.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.103
It's no problem. I like to cook.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.905
My mom taught me how.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.640
I used to like to cook, too.

15:43.977 --> 15:47.278
- Summer!
- Good morning to you, too.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.682
I was just making
sure you were up.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.284
- You made breakfast.
- Cara did.

15:53.386 --> 15:57.555
So, Cara, how did you
sleep last night?

15:57.657 --> 16:00.325
Just fine. Thank you so much
for letting me stay the night.

16:02.095 --> 16:05.463
You keep makin' breakfast, you
can stay anytime you want.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.305
Summer, did you use my computer?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.040
I just got up.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.742
Is something wrong?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.477
My USB drive.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.714
I know I left it in
my laptop last night.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.315
We'll help you look.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.487
Oh, this can't be happenin'.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.322
Our presentation is today.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.057
All the work I did
last night was on it.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.259
Summer, are you sure
you didn't use it?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.662
How is this suddenly my fault?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.697
Here, let me, um...

16:41.201 --> 16:42.712
Okay, so it's just
a few hours to go,

16:42.736 --> 16:45.670
there might still be a
temp file in the cache.

16:48.441 --> 16:51.109
Ah! That's it!

16:51.211 --> 16:52.810
All right, so I'll save a copy

16:52.912 --> 16:54.479
and you can just email
it to yourself.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.180
Oh, Cara, you are a lifesaver,

16:56.282 --> 16:58.182
you can stay over anytime.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.985
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.321
No problem, mom.

17:05.592 --> 17:08.192
So she recovered her files?

17:08.294 --> 17:10.261
Just like on <i> CSI.</i>

17:10.363 --> 17:13.464
No offence, but she sounds like
a way better daughter than you.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.465
My mother certainly
seems to think so.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.002
Maybe she's just used to
picking up the slack at home.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.471
Sure, doing the dishes,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.874
making the breakfast,
teaching the Spanish,

17:22.976 --> 17:24.876
hacking the computers...

17:24.978 --> 17:26.978
I'm sending her to
your house next.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.680
I have a feeling Jessica will be

17:28.704 --> 17:29.514
very taken by her.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.948
Ew, no way.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.117
I don't like her, and
you can't make me.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.685
Don't like who?

17:34.788 --> 17:36.354
- Um...
- Uh...

17:36.456 --> 17:38.156
Tori is, uh, talking
about herself

17:38.258 --> 17:39.590
in the third person again.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.630
- Need something?
- Coffee?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.172
It just happens to
be your lucky day.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.507
I happen to know the barista

17:48.609 --> 17:50.334
and she is adorable.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.503
What do you have?

17:52.605 --> 17:55.206
- Black coffee?
- Coming right up.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.076
Did Summer mention
she works here?

17:58.178 --> 18:00.478
No. Sheer luck.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.881
Oh. How about that?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.917
Uh, do you wanna study
again tonight, Summer?

18:06.019 --> 18:09.587
Maybe, I get off of work at 8:00.
So I will text you.

18:09.689 --> 18:13.357
- Okay.
- One black coffee.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.393
- What do I owe you?
- It's on the house.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.161
New girl discount.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.130
Thank you.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.501
So we'll see you later.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.536
- Oh, uh...
- I'll, I'll walk with you.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.004
Okay.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.440
You're leaving?

18:32.112 --> 18:34.645
I promised my dad I'd help
him with his truck tonight.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.048
- Call me?
- Maybe.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.283
I have to call Alexis first.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.185
You're not funny.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.325
Um, thanks, Summer.
Uh, see you soon.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.295
Bye!

18:51.397 --> 18:53.264
What a bitch!

18:53.366 --> 18:54.606
<i>You and Summer are cute.</i>

18:54.630 --> 18:56.033
She's cute, I'm just lucky.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.869
How long have you been together?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.604
Couple of years now, I guess.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.440
Do you need a ride somewhere?

19:02.542 --> 19:04.075
Maybe. Where are you headed?

19:04.177 --> 19:06.777
My house, which is
out past County 2.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.646
Hm. You want some company?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.583
Nah, I better just get home.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.620
- Okay. See you around.
- Yup. See you.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.702
Thank you. Thank you for
taking the time, sir.

19:31.804 --> 19:34.038
- We'll be in touch.
- We're looking forward to it.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.307
Yup. Yeah.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.642
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.747
- You killed it!
- We killed it!

19:42.849 --> 19:44.382
No, did you see
his face light up

19:44.484 --> 19:46.128
with the roll-out plan? Did
you see that he was like...

19:46.152 --> 19:48.519
Yeah, it made the last six
months almost worth it.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.854
- Right? Okay.
- Almost.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.455
Well...

19:51.558 --> 19:52.790
You earned yourself a break.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.092
Just take the rest of the day.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.626
- Really?
- Yes!

19:55.728 --> 19:57.428
You have been up all night, and.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.864
All this stuff going
on and just...

19:59.966 --> 20:01.999
Great job, Lianne. Really.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.268
- Great job.
- Thank you.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.705
- Uh...
- Um...

20:34.534 --> 20:36.100
- Hey, mom.
- Hi, Cara.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.603
- Is Summer here?
- She works today.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.082
She usually gets
home around 8:00.

20:40.106 --> 20:41.739
We were gonna study.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.407
I must've gotten
the times wrong.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.775
I'm so sorry, I'll be back.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.944
Why don't you come in and wait?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.766
- I don't want to be a bother.
- Oh, please.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.249
I could use a company. Come on.

20:51.351 --> 20:54.819
So do you feel like you're
getting the hang of it here?

20:56.356 --> 20:59.323
Um, it's challenging

20:59.425 --> 21:01.305
starting a new school in
the middle of the year.

21:01.329 --> 21:03.928
But Summer's really gone out of
her way to make me feel welcome.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.030
She got an A-minus
in her retest.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.300
That's great! Oh! Thank
you for helpin' her.

21:09.402 --> 21:12.436
I, I know she's been struggling

21:12.538 --> 21:14.739
ever since her dad died.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.907
I'm so sorry. What happened?

21:19.545 --> 21:21.812
It was a car accident.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.447
Summer and her dad
were very close,

21:23.549 --> 21:26.217
and it hit her like
a freight train.

21:26.319 --> 21:29.420
And now I'm, I'm always worried.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.123
Am I pushing too hard,
not hard enough?

21:37.897 --> 21:40.097
I just hope I'm not
messing everything up.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.101
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.143
Hey, you're a good mom.

21:52.245 --> 21:53.878
Summer's lucky to have you.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.181
Anyone would be.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.650
Hey.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.053
Hi, sweetie. How was work?

22:02.155 --> 22:04.088
Extremely fulfilling.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.001
There's no better way to
serve your fellow man

22:06.025 --> 22:08.292
than by serving him
Peruvian blend coffee.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.095
Cara, what are you doing here?

22:11.197 --> 22:13.664
Oh, I got our study
times mixed up.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.099
And I got talking to your mom.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.935
Cara told me you got an
A-minus on your retest.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.338
Honey, congratulations.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.907
I was gonna surprise
you when I got home.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.079
Are you ready to study?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.548
Actually, I think I'm
gonna call it a night.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.451
Give my brain a rest. See
you tomorrow at school.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.820
Uh, I could warm up
some dinner for you.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.955
Don't bother.

22:41.728 --> 22:45.029
- I think she's mad at me.
- No, don't worry, sweetie.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.497
She's just...

22:48.868 --> 22:52.236
Cara? What's wrong?

22:52.338 --> 22:54.705
It's, it's nothing.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.108
Well, what is it?

22:59.379 --> 23:01.212
I'm-I'm sorry, it's just...

23:03.049 --> 23:04.749
I-it's my mom, um...

23:04.851 --> 23:06.817
Sometimes it just hits me and...

23:08.554 --> 23:09.720
Oh.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.391
Hey...

23:15.294 --> 23:17.294
Do you wanna talk about it?

23:21.734 --> 23:22.967
I...

23:24.537 --> 23:26.737
I didn't tell Summer everything.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.008
My mom didn't just die.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.980
- She was killed.
- Oh, Cara...

23:36.082 --> 23:38.149
The police never
found her killer.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.988
You know, she was everything
to me, and now...

23:46.225 --> 23:49.026
the house just feels
so empty without her.

23:52.365 --> 23:54.765
Well, what about your dad?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.400
I never see him.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.570
I'm just alone.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.674
I-I'm sorry, this
isn't your problem.

24:03.776 --> 24:07.678
Cara, wait. You are
always welcome here.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.183
I don't wanna be any trouble.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.351
No. Not at all.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.521
We love having you.
Anytime at all.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.890
Thank you.

24:43.850 --> 24:44.982
Hey.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.284
Hey.

24:48.855 --> 24:49.975
What are you doin' out here?

24:49.999 --> 24:51.899
Just waiting.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.330
Well, I, uh, I'm already
late for practice...

24:55.354 --> 24:56.634
Maybe you'll be a few minutes...

24:56.658 --> 24:59.163
Cara, stop. Stop!

24:59.265 --> 25:00.309
What is wrong with you?

25:00.333 --> 25:01.932
Listen, I'm sorry if you misread

25:02.034 --> 25:04.001
the situation, but
I'm with Summer.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.804
You and I are done hanging out.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.373
Jason. Jason!

25:25.091 --> 25:27.091
Jason, stop. I'm studying.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.494
- I'm super study-able.
- You are super something.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.264
Super into you.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.933
Tsk, well, that is a bummer

25:36.035 --> 25:37.701
'cause I'm super
into someone else.

25:37.803 --> 25:40.037
Well, tell that
person to get lost.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.041
Yo, Jason! Get up, man.

25:46.812 --> 25:48.879
Ah. What the hell, Scott?

25:48.981 --> 25:50.948
- How long?
- I don't know what you're talk...

25:51.050 --> 25:52.370
How long have you
been seeing her?

25:52.394 --> 25:53.484
- Seeing who?
- Alexis!

25:53.586 --> 25:55.306
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

25:55.330 --> 25:57.454
She pretended the
exact same thing.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.390
Could explain why
I found this...

26:00.826 --> 26:02.226
in her car.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.228
- Scott, I swear.
- You know what, man?

26:04.330 --> 26:05.829
It's all right.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.631
You two deserve each other.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.035
Sorry, Summer.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.938
What the hell, man?

26:16.742 --> 26:19.877
Summer, it's not
what it looks like.

26:19.979 --> 26:23.380
Jason de la Garza,
state champion.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.317
You and Alexis, you pretended
this whole time it was a joke!

26:26.419 --> 26:28.430
Summer, there hasn't been a me
and Alexis since freshman year.

26:28.454 --> 26:29.720
- Ugh!
- Summer, I love you.

26:29.822 --> 26:30.862
And you know I would never

26:30.964 --> 26:31.975
do anything to hurt you.

26:31.999 --> 26:33.624
Stay away from me, Jason.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.998
All right, uh, excellent.
Thank you.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.601
Yeah. Thank you.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.770
Well, I just got off the phone

26:46.872 --> 26:48.072
with the Vital group.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.441
And it is not great.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.110
Hm.

26:53.212 --> 26:55.379
So we got the account, but
we have to work even harder

26:55.481 --> 26:57.414
for the next six months.

27:00.219 --> 27:03.420
How? How-how did you know?

27:03.522 --> 27:05.634
Because my first week here
you got the Snider account

27:05.658 --> 27:07.858
and you delivered the news
in the same exact way.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.526
Just like that? I
did the whole...

27:09.629 --> 27:11.195
Just like that.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.397
Think I was crying last time.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.132
Oh, my gosh.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.267
- But we got the account!
- Yes!

27:20.039 --> 27:21.605
- Oh.
- Hm.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.607
All right. Yeah.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.611
So, um, I guess we, uh,
we need to celebrate.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.248
What did you have in mind?

27:31.350 --> 27:35.319
Uh, well, how about, um...
I got it.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.622
Takeout and beer... right here

27:38.724 --> 27:43.160
because, unfortunately, we need
to pull comps by tomorrow.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.763
- You're kidding. A Saturday?
- No.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.798
Yeah, they wanna work
over the weekend

27:47.900 --> 27:49.800
so they can make the
announcement on Monday.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.830
You know, hey, look,
I'll tell you what.

27:52.854 --> 27:54.772
I will make it up to you.

27:54.874 --> 27:58.308
- I'll let you pick the beer.
- Ugh.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.511
Wow, I don't know what to say.

28:00.613 --> 28:02.880
Don't say a thing. I got this.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.351
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.387
I didn't give him a chance.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.958
Summer, you know I think
Jason is a moron.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.960
Yeah, you told me. Thank you.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.163
But this doesn't sound like him.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.434
- Don't you at least wanna...
- No, Tori, I don't.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.972
- I swear!
- What?

28:31.410 --> 28:32.876
You'll never guess.

28:32.978 --> 28:35.345
My mom's freakin' late again.

28:35.448 --> 28:38.382
- How late?
- Like, don't-wait-up late.

28:41.487 --> 28:43.153
What are you doing?

28:43.255 --> 28:46.490
It's Friday night, your
mom is out of the house,

28:46.592 --> 28:48.358
your boyfriend is a jerk,

28:48.461 --> 28:51.228
and we are having a
party to cheer you up.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.796
Tori, no.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.966
- Summer, yes.
- Tori...

28:56.068 --> 28:58.736
Hey, I heard what
happened with Jason.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.504
I'm so sorry.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.139
Okay, if you don't
talk to him, I will.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.842
No!

29:04.944 --> 29:08.445
Um, guys like him don't
deserve a second chance.

29:09.615 --> 29:10.981
Guys like what?

29:13.686 --> 29:15.185
The other day at the cafe...

29:15.287 --> 29:16.553
- He hit on me.
- What?

29:16.655 --> 29:18.889
He tried to get me
to go home with him.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.991
I didn't wanna say
anything because I didn't

29:21.015 --> 29:22.364
wanna hurt you, Summer.

29:22.388 --> 29:24.388
When I was back at Jefferson,
there was this guy...

29:24.412 --> 29:26.512
I thought you transferred
from Hamilton.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.904
That's right. Uh, I lived in
Hamilton, then Jefferson.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.274
Sounds like you get around.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.743
Hm.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.379
So are you ready for tonight?
I've been making flash cards.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.348
- Tonight?
- Uh...

29:44.450 --> 29:46.083
We're studying.

29:46.185 --> 29:47.618
No, not tonight.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.287
You promised you'd come
with me to visit Gam-Gam.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.223
You know, she's gonna be so
disappointed if you don't come.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.693
- Tori...
- You promised.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.729
Cara, I'm sorry.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.631
I, I must have double-booked.

30:00.733 --> 30:02.332
Can we do Sunday?

30:04.670 --> 30:07.871
- Sunday's perfect.
- Great. Sorry.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.374
Well, we better get going.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.442
Don't wanna keep
Gam-Gam waiting.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.711
Bye!

30:20.319 --> 30:22.319
Maybe we should invite her.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.756
Summer, she thinks we're
visiting a woman named Gam-Gam.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.157
- She's fine.
- I just feel bad.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.426
- She just moved here.
- I know, right?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.288
Which is why it's so
weird that it feels like

30:31.312 --> 30:33.997
she's been irritating the
crap out of me forever.

30:34.099 --> 30:36.166
She's not that bad. What if...

30:36.268 --> 30:38.068
Okay, Summer...

30:38.170 --> 30:40.737
People are here. Cool
people, fun people.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.172
So forget about lame people.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.641
No Jason, no Cara.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.579
Now show me your party face.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.148
That's my girl.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.750
<i>♪ The DJ playin' our
favorite song ♪</i>

30:53.853 --> 30:55.352
<i>♪ So grab my hand come on ♪</i>

30:55.454 --> 30:56.832

30:56.856 --> 30:58.455

31:03.095 --> 31:04.995

31:05.097 --> 31:08.131

31:08.234 --> 31:11.368
With staggered rollouts and
the top 20 media markets

31:11.470 --> 31:13.937
through the first
and second quarter.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.973
- Bam. All right.
- Mm-hmm.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.275
Well, I think we have
earned a five-minute break.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.943
I think we've earned ten.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.778
All right, then.
Productivity be damned.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.081
- Ten minutes, no work.
- Mm.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.017
Oh...

31:29.288 --> 31:32.289
Well, um...

31:32.391 --> 31:34.024
what shall we talk about?

31:36.161 --> 31:38.962
Well, um...

31:39.064 --> 31:42.733
they finally restocked
the Post-its.

31:42.835 --> 31:44.334
- Did they?
- Mm-hmm.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.304
Yeah? I think we can do,
maybe a little better.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.706
- Oh.
- Um...

31:49.808 --> 31:52.809
Let's talk about...

31:52.912 --> 31:55.379
what you're doing
tomorrow night.

31:55.481 --> 31:56.847
Why?

31:56.949 --> 31:59.816
Did Vital call
with more demands?

31:59.919 --> 32:02.286
- No, no, they did not.
- No.

32:03.656 --> 32:04.988
That's good.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.592
That's very good.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.473
Um...

32:23.575 --> 32:26.443
- Sorry, Steve.
- No, no, it's okay.

32:28.647 --> 32:29.913
Hello?

32:30.883 --> 32:32.683
Summer, where are you?

32:34.353 --> 32:35.552
What?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.390
It wasn't a big deal. We
only had a few people over.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.203
You were picked
up by the police.

32:42.227 --> 32:44.194
It is a big, big deal.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.030
It was my fault, Lianne.
Summer didn't wanna do it.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.932
I was the one who said
we should have a party.

32:48.956 --> 32:51.535
But she did it anyway. Is that
supposed to make me feel better?

32:51.637 --> 32:53.397
Maybe if you were home
for once in your life.

32:53.421 --> 32:54.972
- Excuse me?
- You promised.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.773
When your stupid
presentation was done,

32:56.875 --> 32:58.375
you wouldn't be working 24/7.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.711
Don't you dare blame me, Summer.

33:00.813 --> 33:02.946
The neighbors called the police.

33:03.048 --> 33:05.782
They said there were 30
people blasting music.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.451
We had six people over.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.386
And we weren't even being loud.
I swear!

33:09.488 --> 33:11.321
Forgive me if I don't
take your word for it

33:11.423 --> 33:13.423
while I'm driving you home
from the police station.

33:13.447 --> 33:15.592
Mom, you're being a bit harsh.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.828
No, this is me being harsh.
You are grounded.

33:17.930 --> 33:20.030
You go to school, you go
to work, you come home.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.400
No games, no parties,
no friends, no Jason.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.037
Jason and I broke up.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.807
Summer, why didn't you tell me?

33:32.177 --> 33:34.044
You weren't home.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.679
Summer...

33:44.790 --> 33:46.423
How's Gam-Gam?

33:48.394 --> 33:50.260
Did you guys enjoy your visit?

33:53.165 --> 33:56.733
You called the police.
I knew you sucked.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.715
But I didn't realize you
were such a huge bitch.

33:58.817 --> 34:00.517
I'm not the one who got
my friend arrested.

34:00.619 --> 34:03.707
- Actually, you are.
- You lied, got drunk.

34:03.809 --> 34:07.544
Threw a party and got arrested.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.246
I'm trying to help Summer,
not hold her back.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.668
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Why don't you ask Lianne?

34:14.887 --> 34:16.152
Go to hell.

34:26.031 --> 34:28.931
- Summer, wait up.
- I'm gonna be late.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.474
Since when has that
ever stopped you?

34:30.498 --> 34:31.802
Oh, I don't know.

34:31.904 --> 34:33.815
I wonder what might have changed
in the past couple of days

34:33.839 --> 34:35.850
to make me more cautious
about following the rules.

34:35.873 --> 34:37.574
Brainstorm on that,
then get back to me.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.876
- I get it. But, Summer...
- I just need some space.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.344
- Okay, but if you just give me...
- Stop!

34:51.690 --> 34:53.956
Hey, I haven't seen you all day.

34:54.059 --> 34:55.625
- Busy day.
- Uh, I feel you.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.694
So what's the plan for tonight?

34:57.796 --> 35:00.030
- Nothing. I'm grounded.
- Oh, that's right.

35:00.132 --> 35:02.799
Well, I'm so sorry Tori
got you into trouble.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.836
I got myself into trouble.
I can't blame Tori.

35:05.938 --> 35:07.715
Didn't you say she's the one
that wanted to have the party?

35:07.739 --> 35:09.139
Look, can we just drop it?

35:09.241 --> 35:12.342
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.778
- Maybe we can study tonight.
- I told you, I'm grounded.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.113
I'm sure your mom won't mind.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.948
Oh, I just want to
be alone tonight.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.251
Okay. Well, I'll text you.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.229
You're home early.

35:32.331 --> 35:35.332
Yes. I've been waiting for you.

35:35.434 --> 35:38.568
Found more fun and inventive
ways to punish me?

35:38.670 --> 35:42.072
- Summer, I don't wanna fight.
- Then what do you want?

35:42.174 --> 35:45.375
I want to have a girls'
night with my daughter.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.579
I get to pick the rom-com.

35:56.221 --> 35:59.322
Summer, you can't
stay mad forever.

35:59.424 --> 36:02.125
My necklace misses
your bracelet.

36:02.227 --> 36:04.261
Look, call me back, please.

36:28.086 --> 36:31.521
Wow. These two really
do not like each other.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.857
They have so many differences.

36:33.959 --> 36:37.360
She's so by the book and he
flies by the seat of his pants.

36:37.462 --> 36:39.496
How are they ever
gonna make this work?

36:42.367 --> 36:45.936
Speaking of making it work...

36:46.038 --> 36:48.538
What happened with Jason?

36:48.640 --> 36:51.408
I don't wanna talk about it.

36:51.510 --> 36:52.921
Honey, you know you
can talk to me.

36:52.945 --> 36:54.411
Mom, please.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.780
I'm worried about you.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.816
Honey, you sure you're okay?

36:59.918 --> 37:01.318
I'm fine.

37:07.626 --> 37:08.692
- Cara?
- Hey.

37:08.794 --> 37:10.104
You weren't answering you phone,

37:10.128 --> 37:11.428
so I decided to stop by.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.396
Plus, I made cupcakes.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.031
What are you doing here?

37:15.133 --> 37:17.534
Well, you seemed sad and I
wanted to cheer you up.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.636
Plus, I thought we could study.

37:19.738 --> 37:23.139
I said tomorrow, maybe tomorrow.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.908
Oh, yeah, that's right.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.477
Well, maybe I can convince your
mom to let me stay. Is she...

37:27.579 --> 37:29.412
- Hi, Cara.
- Hey! Summer and I were just...

37:29.514 --> 37:31.781
Cara just stopped by to
see how I was doing.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.117
Mom, can we study
together tomorrow?

37:34.219 --> 37:37.325
- Sure, but if Cara wants to...
- Perfect. We'll see ya tomorrow.

37:37.349 --> 37:39.029
- Summer...
- Four would be great.

37:39.053 --> 37:40.752
I can leave the cup...

37:43.595 --> 37:45.996
Hey. Hey!

37:46.098 --> 37:47.430
What was that all about?

37:47.532 --> 37:49.966
I'm grounded, remember?

37:50.068 --> 37:51.768
That's still no
reason to be rude.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.570
Mom, she was stalking me

37:53.672 --> 37:55.338
at school all day.
I needed a break.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.140
You could use some nice
friends like Cara.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.587
- As opposed to Tori, right?
- Hey, that's not what I said.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.344
Just what you meant.

38:01.446 --> 38:05.282
I just wish Tori would
be a better influence.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.718
No. You wish you had
a better daughter.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.324
Honey, can we please
just finish the movie?

38:14.426 --> 38:15.892
Maybe you can catch Cara.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.361
I'm sure she would love to
watch the movie with you.

41:07.599 --> 41:09.232
Hello?

41:15.874 --> 41:18.374
Mm, Summer special.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.532
What the hell?

43:27.973 --> 43:30.006
This was 15 years ago.

43:41.519 --> 43:42.652
- You ready?
- Yeah.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.921
Okay. Let's go.

43:50.428 --> 43:51.894
What was that?

43:56.868 --> 43:59.035
Oh, my God.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.138
Tori!

44:10.281 --> 44:13.583
And when was the last
time you saw Tori?

44:13.685 --> 44:16.285
Yesterday at school.

44:16.388 --> 44:19.856
She tried to talk to me,
but I was avoiding her.

44:19.958 --> 44:22.859
She texted me last night.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.605
You were leaving the
garage, weren't you?

44:24.629 --> 44:26.629
I didn't see her.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.031
I checked, I swear.

44:28.133 --> 44:29.732
M-miss, she was...

44:29.834 --> 44:33.503
Tori had been dead several
hours when you found her.

44:33.605 --> 44:35.872
Do you know why she was here?

44:38.243 --> 44:41.911
Mom, the drain pipe.

44:42.013 --> 44:44.113
She used to climb the drain pipe

44:44.215 --> 44:46.816
to get to my daughter's window.

44:46.918 --> 44:48.951
She must've fallen.

44:49.054 --> 44:51.287
Any idea why she was
trying to reach you?

44:53.024 --> 44:55.258
We were fighting.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.326
I think I should've
talked to her.

44:57.429 --> 45:00.296
Oh, honey, it's okay.

45:01.499 --> 45:03.466
Uh, so what happens now?

45:03.568 --> 45:07.336
Well, if you can think of
anything else, give me a call.

45:07.439 --> 45:09.039
Yeah, we'll wait for
the coroner's report

45:09.063 --> 45:11.107
and go from there.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.643
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

45:13.745 --> 45:15.044
Thank you.

45:19.584 --> 45:21.484
Come on, sweetheart,
let's go inside.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.470
- Cara.
- Hi, mom.

45:40.572 --> 45:42.071
I heard what happened.

45:45.276 --> 45:46.943
Why don't you come in?

45:52.083 --> 45:53.216
Thank you, a. That's ver.

45:53.318 --> 45:55.651
She's been up in
her room all day.

45:55.754 --> 45:58.087
I'm just trying to
give her some space.

45:58.189 --> 46:01.924
I'm sure you're handling
it the best that you can.

46:02.026 --> 46:03.826
What happened?

46:03.928 --> 46:07.563
She fell off the roof. I
was ignoring her calls.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.832
She tried to come see me.

46:09.934 --> 46:13.836
Look, Summer, I am so sorry.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.074
What's that?

46:18.176 --> 46:20.576
Oh, it's my guaranteed
cheer-up basket.

46:20.678 --> 46:23.713
Uh, bath salts, herbal
teas, essential oils.

46:23.815 --> 46:27.650
- The lavender is amazing.
- Thanks.

46:27.752 --> 46:30.953
Girls, will you excuse
me for just a second?

46:33.191 --> 46:35.124
How are you holding up?

46:35.226 --> 46:37.193
It's been a pretty crappy week.

46:37.295 --> 46:40.229
I think I know how I can
make it a little better.

46:44.169 --> 46:45.768
- Cara...
- Go on.

46:45.870 --> 46:47.570
Open it.

46:47.672 --> 46:48.971
A BFF necklace.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.553
I know you just lost
your best friend,

46:50.577 --> 46:51.974
but I don't want
you to feel like

46:52.076 --> 46:54.443
you don't have one anymore.
Do you want to try it on?

46:54.546 --> 46:56.746
- Is this a sick joke?
- And here. It's real gold.

46:56.848 --> 46:58.528
It won't stain your
neck green like Tori's.

46:58.552 --> 47:00.583
What the hell is wrong with you?

47:00.685 --> 47:03.219
I got you a gift. I thought...

47:03.321 --> 47:03.619
You thought what? That
we were best friends?

47:03.721 --> 47:05.254
Wrong?

47:05.356 --> 47:07.957
I think Summer is just
upset about Tori.

47:08.059 --> 47:10.159
No, Summer is upset

47:10.261 --> 47:12.028
because there's a
psycho in her house.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.596
- Summer!
- Oh.

47:13.698 --> 47:16.432
Of course, you're
gonna side with her.

47:16.534 --> 47:18.815
Honey, I-I-I know you're going
through something terrible,

47:18.839 --> 47:21.206
but you, you owe her an apology.

47:23.608 --> 47:27.376
You know what? I will apologize.

47:27.478 --> 47:29.912
I'm sorry that I'm the only one

47:30.014 --> 47:32.048
who can see how
messed up this is!

48:40.382 --> 48:41.862
Hey, I didn't see you
at school today.

48:41.886 --> 48:43.006
I thought you might be here.

48:43.030 --> 48:44.185
Had to get out of the house.

48:44.209 --> 48:45.289
I didn't wanna see anybody.

48:45.313 --> 48:46.722
Wait, Summer.

48:46.824 --> 48:47.890
I know you're upset.

48:47.992 --> 48:50.159
I crossed the line.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.395
- I wasn't thinking.
- Yeah, that's pretty clear.

48:52.497 --> 48:55.197
- I'm just trying to apologize.
- Cara, I don't want an apology.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.700
- I just want a break from you.
- Summer, wait.

49:00.171 --> 49:01.771
Give me my backpack.

49:01.873 --> 49:04.473
Okay, um, I'll leave you alone.

49:04.575 --> 49:06.008
Thanks.

49:25.129 --> 49:26.362
Hey, mom.

49:28.132 --> 49:29.365
Cara?

49:30.969 --> 49:32.301
Uh...

49:32.403 --> 49:34.270
Well, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

49:34.372 --> 49:36.072
Do you mind if I sit down?

49:37.575 --> 49:38.874
Uh, go ahead.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.181
Um...

49:46.684 --> 49:50.086
I wanted to talk to you about Summer.
I'm worried.

49:51.222 --> 49:52.888
What about Summer?

49:52.991 --> 49:55.691
Well, you saw the way she
blubbed at me the other day

49:55.793 --> 49:57.860
at your house.

49:57.962 --> 50:00.029
Cara, I'm sorry about that.

50:00.131 --> 50:01.864
She was upset from
the morning and...

50:01.966 --> 50:05.201
No, no, no, it's fine.
It's just...

50:05.303 --> 50:07.703
That's not the first
time it's happened.

50:07.805 --> 50:10.506
And, you know, she was
fighting with Tori...

50:10.608 --> 50:12.708
Right, but that was
about the party.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.645
Tori told me they've
been fighting a lot.

50:16.748 --> 50:19.148
Summer changed.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.851
The way she talked
about it, it, um,

50:21.953 --> 50:24.153
it reminded me of a
friend back home.

50:24.255 --> 50:25.654
Her grades started dropping,

50:25.757 --> 50:28.858
she started partying,
fighting...

50:28.960 --> 50:30.426
What are you saying?

50:31.996 --> 50:33.162
It was drugs.

50:33.264 --> 50:34.384
You know, we didn't find out

50:34.408 --> 50:35.442
until it was too late.

50:35.466 --> 50:37.566
Cara...

50:37.668 --> 50:41.037
I'm sorry, but you
are way out of line.

50:41.139 --> 50:43.939
Summer is having a hard time,
but I trust my daughter.

50:44.042 --> 50:45.402
Lianne, I didn't
mean to upset you.

50:45.426 --> 50:46.792
I think you should leave.

50:47.278 --> 50:48.511
Now.

50:55.319 --> 50:56.986
I know you want what's
best for Summer.

50:58.256 --> 51:00.423
I hope you know that's
what I want, too.

51:03.361 --> 51:06.162
Whoa, uh, excuse me. Sorry.

51:07.965 --> 51:09.265
Everything okay?

51:11.369 --> 51:13.002
Yes, everything's fine.

51:13.638 --> 51:14.870
Let's go.

51:21.712 --> 51:22.845
Summer?

51:42.834 --> 51:43.966
What are you taking?

51:44.068 --> 51:45.768
- Mom?
- What are these?

51:45.870 --> 51:48.170
- What are you talking about?
- Don't lie to me, Summer.

51:48.272 --> 51:51.240
- They were in your backpack.
- Why were you in my backpack?

51:51.342 --> 51:52.986
You don't get to change
the subject here,

51:53.010 --> 51:54.577
not when the subject
is your drug use.

51:54.679 --> 51:56.178
I'm not using drugs.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.148
You're moody, withdrawn,
your grades are slipping,

51:59.250 --> 52:00.783
you're fighting
with your friends.

52:00.885 --> 52:03.586
- Cara tells me that you...
- You talked to Cara?

52:03.688 --> 52:06.689
She's worried about
you, with good reason.

52:06.791 --> 52:08.424
So all of this is
coming from her?

52:08.526 --> 52:10.486
Okay, don't try to make
this about something else.

52:10.510 --> 52:11.527
I'm not trying.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.862
Everything has been about her

52:12.964 --> 52:14.084
since the day she showed up.

52:14.186 --> 52:15.346
I can't believe you're trying

52:15.370 --> 52:16.465
to scapegoat her.

52:16.567 --> 52:19.768
Your father would
be so disappointed.

52:21.906 --> 52:23.105
Get out.

52:24.742 --> 52:26.809
- Summer...
- Get out!

52:31.182 --> 52:32.882
This isn't going away.

53:15.626 --> 53:17.993
- Hi, mom. Mind if I join you?
- Cara?

53:22.433 --> 53:25.734
Cara, I owe you an apology.

53:25.836 --> 53:28.437
The other day I shouldn't
have snapped at you.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.839
Is everything all right?

53:30.942 --> 53:32.508
You were right.

53:35.046 --> 53:37.012
I didn't wanna be.

53:37.114 --> 53:38.414
I am so worried.

53:38.516 --> 53:41.784
I just want her to get
the help she needs.

53:41.886 --> 53:44.553
What are you up to today?
Need a company...

53:44.655 --> 53:47.256
Hey, I hope you
weren't waiting long.

53:47.358 --> 53:49.892
No, um, I, I just got here

53:49.994 --> 53:51.805
and I was chatting with
my daughter's friend.

53:51.829 --> 53:54.063
Cara, this is Steve from work.

53:54.165 --> 53:56.937
- Cara, very nice to meet you.
- Didn't know I was crashing.

53:56.961 --> 53:58.561
- No, no...
- No, we were just getting...

53:58.585 --> 53:59.802
No, I can take a hint.

53:59.904 --> 54:02.104
Have a great time.

54:02.206 --> 54:04.039
It was nice to meet you.

54:08.546 --> 54:11.046
Uh, seems like you're
spending a lot of time

54:11.148 --> 54:13.549
with your daughter's friends.

54:13.651 --> 54:15.551
Just the one.

54:15.653 --> 54:18.287
Actually, it's a good thing.

54:18.389 --> 54:20.589
She told me some
things about Summer.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.804
I lived in Hamilton,
then Jefferson.

54:50.855 --> 54:52.321
Thanks for coming.

54:52.423 --> 54:55.324
- Summer, I...
- Wait, before you say anything.

54:55.426 --> 54:58.994
I'm so sorry, Jason. I
made a huge mistake.

54:59.096 --> 55:00.562
I should've trusted you.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.032
I hope you can forgive me.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.501
So...

55:05.603 --> 55:07.603
what did you want to show me?

55:07.705 --> 55:11.674
This. "Jefferson High
School student found dead."

55:11.776 --> 55:13.375
I don't, I don't get it.

55:14.779 --> 55:16.378
This is Courtney Lund.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.040
Her and her mother
were killed last year

55:18.064 --> 55:20.030
by a girl named Ashley Carter.

55:21.952 --> 55:23.585
Do you recognize this?

55:25.556 --> 55:27.523
This is the same exact necklace

55:27.625 --> 55:30.459
that Cara wore to school
on her first day.

55:30.561 --> 55:34.463
There are a lot of necklaces
in the world, Summer.

55:34.565 --> 55:37.032
"Courtney's sister,
April, described Carter"

55:37.134 --> 55:38.634
as a sweet but
emotionally needy girl

55:38.736 --> 55:40.336
who wormed her way
into their family life

55:40.360 --> 55:41.637
"and then became violent."

55:41.739 --> 55:43.472
That's her. That's Cara.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.407
That's a pretty big leap.

55:45.509 --> 55:49.044
You said it yourself, there's
something wrong with her.

55:49.146 --> 55:52.848
Look, before Tori died,
she tried to reach me.

55:52.950 --> 55:55.551
She had to tell me something.

55:55.653 --> 55:57.686
What if it was about
Cara and Cara found out?

55:57.788 --> 55:59.688
Then you need to
go to the police.

55:59.790 --> 56:02.358
And show them what? This photo?

56:02.460 --> 56:04.860
They're not gonna believe
me any more than you did.

56:04.962 --> 56:06.995
I didn't say I
don't believe you.

56:07.098 --> 56:09.064
I just think you need
to take a minute here.

56:09.166 --> 56:10.799
Do I think she's crazy? Yeah.

56:12.470 --> 56:14.069
But a, a killer?

56:16.540 --> 56:17.773
You're right.

56:19.210 --> 56:21.777
I can't just go accusing
people of murder.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.814
But I can't believe
what happened.

56:30.154 --> 56:32.921
Do you want me to stay
until your mom gets back?

56:33.023 --> 56:34.189
No.

56:35.659 --> 56:38.193
Thanks, Jason.
Thanks for coming.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.064
Look, Summer,

56:42.166 --> 56:44.233
if you're right, then
Cara's dangerous.

56:44.335 --> 56:46.535
Please promise me you're not
gonna do anything stupid.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.304
I promise.

56:55.813 --> 56:59.248
Wow. No wonder you're
all stressed out.

56:59.350 --> 57:01.216
You've had the week from hell.

57:01.318 --> 57:03.285
On top of the year from hell.

57:05.556 --> 57:07.556
Lianne, listen to me.

57:07.658 --> 57:09.658
You are going to
get through this.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.393
You are a good mom.

57:11.495 --> 57:14.463
- How do you know that?
- Because I know you.

57:16.233 --> 57:18.500
Everything is going to be okay.

57:32.283 --> 57:34.650
Oh, boy. I'll get that.

57:34.752 --> 57:35.918
What's up?

57:36.020 --> 57:37.519
Ah, it's just the office.

57:37.621 --> 57:38.921
They can wait. It's fine.

57:39.023 --> 57:40.656
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:40.758 --> 57:43.125
Steve, it's the
middle of a work day,

57:43.227 --> 57:45.260
we're in the middle of
closing the Parker deal.

57:45.362 --> 57:47.596
I'm out all week with Summer.
You should go.

57:47.698 --> 57:49.264
No, really. I, I can...

57:51.268 --> 57:53.335
Wow. It's just gonna
keep doing that, right?

57:53.437 --> 57:55.471
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

57:55.573 --> 57:57.372
Are you sure you don't mind?

57:57.475 --> 57:59.508
Like you said,

57:59.610 --> 58:01.844
everything's gonna be okay.

58:01.946 --> 58:04.346
Yes, it is.

58:04.448 --> 58:06.014
Let me at least walk
you to your car.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.649
- Yes.
- Okay.

58:07.751 --> 58:10.419
Hi. Steve here. Yeah.

58:17.261 --> 58:20.062
No. I, I can meet tomorrow.

58:20.164 --> 58:22.598
Yeah, I'll see you then.
Thank you.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.712
Hi, sweetheart.

58:36.814 --> 58:38.146
What are you working on?

58:38.249 --> 58:40.215
Um, Spanish.

58:40.317 --> 58:41.917
Quiz tomorrow.

58:42.019 --> 58:44.720
I, I thought you were taking
some time off school.

58:46.790 --> 58:49.258
I can't just sit here
alone in this house,

58:49.360 --> 58:53.028
thirty feet from where Tori...

58:53.130 --> 58:55.397
I just want life to
get back to normal.

58:56.667 --> 58:58.834
Well, I can bring you tomorrow.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.937
I have to work late, but we need
to have a talk this weekend.

59:04.141 --> 59:06.308
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:32.603 --> 59:34.736
Ah, my phone.

01:00:58.022 --> 01:00:59.454
Goodnight.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.274
- Hey.
- Steve. What happened?

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:56.178
Well, either a localized tornado
or someone trashed my office.

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.946
What? Who?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.949
I talked with Danny. He didn't
see anything last night.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.131
And imagine, the company
promised to install cameras,

01:02:03.155 --> 01:02:06.855
but, uh, well, a little
late for that, huh?

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:10.258
- Yeah, well, let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.828
I just don't understand
who would have done this.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.330
Well, that I do not know.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.469
- Hey, you're back.
- Oh, hey, Cara. Yeah.

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:22.215
I'm actually not feeling up to it.
I'm gonna head home.

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.399
Oh, do you need some company?

01:02:23.423 --> 01:02:24.703
No, I think I'd rather be alone.

01:02:24.727 --> 01:02:25.807
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:27.776
Well, if you change your mind...

01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:33.648
Hey, um, can I borrow
your Spanish notebooks?

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.684
- What?
- I totally forgot mine.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:37.346
I can take notes tonight
and then we can

01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:38.453
study off it together.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:40.388
Okay, yeah. Sure.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.494
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:46.795
And, uh, Summer.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:49.798
Take care.

01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:06.148
- Be right back.
- Okay, but be quick.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:07.649
The bell's about to ring.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:13.722
Um, April? I'm Summer Hughes.
Thanks for meeting me.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.024
You said you knew something
about Ashley Carter?

01:03:16.048 --> 01:03:19.850
I think I might have found her
or she might have found me.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:22.271
What can you tell me about her?

01:03:22.373 --> 01:03:23.453
Besides the fact that she's

01:03:23.477 --> 01:03:25.000
a murderous psycho bitch?

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.606
I knew right away there was
something off about her,

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:33.175
but my mom and Courtney,

01:03:33.277 --> 01:03:35.410
they thought they
could help her.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.213
Eventually, it got to be
too much even for them.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.015
Stopping by all
hours of the day,

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:42.884
crashing family events.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:44.686
She showed up to my
mom's office picnic

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:47.455
with a meat-and-cheese tray.
Freak show.

01:03:47.558 --> 01:03:49.691
Well, what happened?

01:03:49.793 --> 01:03:52.561
Eventually, they had to
get a restraining order,

01:03:52.663 --> 01:03:55.163
but even that didn't
slow her down.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:59.201
The day before they died,
they got her arrested.

01:04:01.705 --> 01:04:04.105
She got off on bail

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.608
and she went straight
to our house.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:11.646
When I got home, they were
sitting in the living room.

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.953
I just thought they were
watching TV or something.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.321
- Oh.
- I...

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:23.792
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.827
Hey, I left the rest for you...

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.263
Everything okay?

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.765
Will you tell Mrs. B that
I'll be a few minutes late?

01:04:30.868 --> 01:04:32.067
Sure.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.137
Do you have any pictures of her?

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.505
She hated pictures.

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:40.642
Would freak out any
time she saw a camera.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:43.778
April, everything you've
just described to me

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.448
is happening to my
mom and I right now.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:47.983
What do I do?

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:57.425
Detective Stringer, please.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:00.495
It's April Lund.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:05.000
Please have him call me as
soon as he gets this message.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:09.704
- Go home. Don't talk to Ashley.
- Cara?

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.207
Whatever the hell she's
calling herself now.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:14.029
If there's any hint that
you've been talking

01:05:14.053 --> 01:05:15.176
to me or the police,

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:17.445
you're in danger.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.259
As soon as I hear back
from the detective,

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:20.782
I will give you a call.

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:22.428
- Okay, thank you.
- Now you should go.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:23.818
Okay.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.287
Summer.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.189
Be careful.

01:05:28.792 --> 01:05:30.225
Thanks.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.805
Hello?

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.051
Somebody there?

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:15.270
Hi, April.

01:06:17.007 --> 01:06:19.307
It's so nice to see you again.

01:06:31.655 --> 01:06:33.755
- <i>Hello?</i>
- April?

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:37.025
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- Um, I'm looking for April Lund.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:38.526
<i>This is her uncle. Uh...</i>

01:06:38.628 --> 01:06:40.306
<i>I'm sorry you have to
find out this way.</i>

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.863
<i>April died this afternoon.</i>

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:43.698
<i>Are you a friend of hers?</i>

01:06:52.809 --> 01:06:54.642
Detective Martin, please.

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:05.547
Summer!

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.049
Jason!

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:09.384
Summer?

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:13.822
Jason, help me!

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:17.759
Summer? Hey, I'm gonna get
you out of here, all right?

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:44.953
Summer, are you up?

01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:48.756
Honey, listen, I...

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.193
Summer?

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.020
Ah...

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:23.524
What...

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.241
Hello, Summer.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:48.584
Oh.

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:52.020
He doesn't look so good.

01:09:53.456 --> 01:09:55.823
You're probably wondering
where you are.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:57.926
You've decided to
run away together.

01:09:58.929 --> 01:10:00.995
But then you had a fight.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:02.163
There was a struggle

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:06.034
and you accidentally killed him.

01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:10.004
And you couldn't go on and
decided to die painlessly.

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:12.840
But don't worry,
you'll leave a note.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:26.721
Carbon monoxide.

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:29.924
I hope mom will forgive you.

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:33.928
I think she will... eventually.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.899
I'll help her.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:42.870
I'll never tell her how
ungrateful you were.

01:10:42.973 --> 01:10:44.973
The things you said.

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.811
Summer, i-it's mom.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.447
I need you to call me right now.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:55.450
Honey, I love you,
just come home.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:00.154
You never appreciated her.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:02.590
How lucky you were to have her.

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:04.092
To have a mom!

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:08.329
She deserved a better daughter.

01:11:11.268 --> 01:11:14.002
And now she'll have one.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:22.677
Hey, mom.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:23.945
<i>Cara...</i>

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.613
Summer's gone.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.081
- <i>Gone?</i>
- She left a note.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.783
She's runnin' away.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.918
Do you have any idea where
she might have gone?

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.921
Uh, no, sorry, I don't.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.791
Well, if you hear anything...

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:38.926
I can help you look.
I'll be right there.

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:41.396
No. No, that's okay.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:42.697
It's no problem.

01:11:42.799 --> 01:11:45.033
Really, I'd be happy
to help, I can...

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.201
Not now, Cara, please.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:50.271
Just call me right away
if you hear anything.

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.385
Steve?

01:12:05.388 --> 01:12:06.788
It's Lianne.

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:11.292
Mom needs my help,
so I have to go.

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:13.328
You'll fall asleep soon.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.762
It might take a while.

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:16.898
I don't know how
airtight this place is.

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:25.573
I am so glad we met, Summer.

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.576
I'm sorry it had
to end this way.

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:31.079
We would have been
great sisters.

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:38.353
Jason!

01:12:39.556 --> 01:12:41.389
Jason, can you hear me?

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:46.494
Jason! Tell me you're okay.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.063
Come on. Come on. Oh.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:56.637
I got here as soon as I could.
Are you okay?

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:59.640
- What are you doing here?
- I was worried.

01:12:59.743 --> 01:13:02.443
I want to help you.

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:05.380
- Now is not a good time.
- That's why I'm here, mom.

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:07.715
Stop calling me that!

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:10.251
I have a daughter
and she's missing.

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:22.864
Okay. Let's go looking for her.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.635
- I'm waiting.
- For what?

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.204
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:31.706
You, uh, are you,
are you all right?

01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:33.207
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:13:33.309 --> 01:13:35.469
- Thank you so much for coming.
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:37.326
Did you, did you
call the police?

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:40.248
She's a runaway.

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.351
They said it's not a priority
until she's been missing

01:13:43.453 --> 01:13:44.497
for 24 hours.

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:46.220
Okay, okay, okay.

01:13:46.322 --> 01:13:48.089
Hang in there. Hang in there.

01:13:48.191 --> 01:13:50.425
Do you have any idea where
Summer might have gone?

01:13:50.527 --> 01:13:52.760
We are about to go
looking for her.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.273
Excellent, let's
go, we need to go.

01:13:54.297 --> 01:13:56.230
Well, maybe one of us
wants to stay here

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:57.665
in case she comes back.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:13:59.033
Steve?

01:13:59.135 --> 01:14:01.269
That's a good idea, Cara.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.771
- Thank you. Come on.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:07.642
Actually, we should
stay together.

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.349
Hey, David, it's Steven.

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:18.419
I need you to find
a phone for me.

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:22.390
No, I know. I, I know the rules,
but there is a missing girl.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:25.026
I... No, I don't have
time to explain.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:30.264
Excellent. Okay, it's
3-1-0-5-5-5-0-1-4-8.

01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:31.632
What?

01:14:31.734 --> 01:14:34.569
I have a friend in the
Telecom Commission.

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:38.139
But they can't track phones, can they?
Not without GPS.

01:14:38.241 --> 01:14:41.242
They triangulate from
the nearby cell towers.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:42.824
Excellent. Just send it to me.

01:14:42.848 --> 01:14:44.512
Thank you so much.

01:14:44.614 --> 01:14:46.647
All right. Take a right.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:53.721
What would she be doing here?

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.190
Don't know. Let's go find her.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:57.525
All right.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:04.699
Okay, you know what? I'm, I'm
gonna start looking down there.

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:06.078
Okay. All right. Well,
I'll check the house.

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.368
Uh, no. I'll check the house.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.970
You check the garage.

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:33.594
Summer?

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.465
Honey, are you in here?

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.871
- Anything?
- Well, yeah.

01:16:16.973 --> 01:16:19.106
Some, uh, some blood on the ground.
Did you?

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:21.309
There's nothing here.

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:26.981
What was that?

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.817
God! Summer.

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:31.485
Jason, you okay?

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.888
All right, all right, all right.
Just hang in there.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.957
I'm gonna get something
to cut you out.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:37.391
All right.

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:38.960
Here we go, here we go.

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:41.629
Please come out.

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:42.997
Honey?

01:16:54.677 --> 01:16:56.911
Go! Go!

01:17:27.677 --> 01:17:28.909
Cara?

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:07.114
Summer?

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.231
No.

01:18:24.333 --> 01:18:25.766
Hi, mom.

01:18:28.438 --> 01:18:29.737
Cara...

01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.774
Where's Summer?

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.477
You don't need her anymore.

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:38.746
Ungrateful whiny bitch.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:42.616
I can be your daughter.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.252
I'll be easy.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:47.188
I won't fight with you.

01:18:48.124 --> 01:18:49.323
Mom.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.632
Cara, where's my daughter...

01:18:58.735 --> 01:19:01.635
I am your daughter!

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.704
- Okay, honey. Just...
- No!

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:06.640
- You're sick, honey.
- No, no!

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:10.211
I am not sick!

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:14.849
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:17.818
I didn't mean it.

01:19:18.688 --> 01:19:19.887
She just...

01:19:20.890 --> 01:19:22.690
She just made me so angry.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.393
I only wanted to scare her.

01:19:29.432 --> 01:19:31.565
But then she wouldn't wake up.

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:35.035
I tried to care for her.

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:38.672
I was only six.

01:19:39.909 --> 01:19:41.709
I lost my mom.

01:19:43.312 --> 01:19:46.147
I needed her and she was gone.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:51.552
She shouldn't have
made me angry.

01:19:51.654 --> 01:19:53.487
None of them should have.

01:19:58.227 --> 01:19:59.760
You're just like them.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.030
You didn't want me.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:06.200
We were supposed to be together.
Can you feel it?

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:08.836
- I'll make you feel it.
- No, Cara.

01:20:08.938 --> 01:20:11.005
I would have been the
perfect daughter.

01:20:11.107 --> 01:20:13.207
Why wouldn't you just love me?

01:20:38.668 --> 01:20:40.301
Mommy.

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:42.269
She's not your mom.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:48.142
Summer. Oh, my God, baby.

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:50.377
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Are you okay?

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:52.379
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- Mom, I'm sorry.

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:55.983
- I love you.
- I love you, mom.

01:21:01.457 --> 01:21:03.891
<i>Perpetrator's unconscious
in the back...</i>

01:21:38.594 --> 01:21:40.027
She's not here.

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:45.733
What about State?

01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:47.935
They have a great vet program.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:50.204
And they're ten minutes away.

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:51.705
What's wrong with that?

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:53.574
- I like it.
- Oh, oh...

01:21:53.676 --> 01:21:56.644
- Oh, caffeinate me.
- Hot, hot.

01:21:56.746 --> 01:21:58.312
- One for you. One for you.
- Thank you.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:21:59.880
Thank you.

01:21:59.982 --> 01:22:01.916
And one for you.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:03.517
What's with the fifth?

01:22:06.589 --> 01:22:08.255
- What?
- Well...

01:22:08.357 --> 01:22:11.058
With me going to
school in the fall,

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.927
Steve thought you might
get a little lonely.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:14.261
Oh.

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:16.063
So...

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:17.175
Well...

01:22:17.199 --> 01:22:19.733
So...

01:22:19.835 --> 01:22:21.835
- It's empty.
- Not empty.

01:22:30.579 --> 01:22:31.812
Oh...

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.816
Oh, my...

01:22:39.288 --> 01:22:40.321
Lianne...

01:22:41.857 --> 01:22:43.257
- Will you...
- Yes.

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:44.792
Yes? Yes?

01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:46.226
Yes. Oh.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:48.829
Mm...

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:53.634
Oh, all right. Let me get it on.

01:22:53.736 --> 01:22:55.269
What?

01:22:55.371 --> 01:22:58.772
- You were all in on this. Oh.
- They kept a secret.

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:01.308
Oh.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:04.044
- I love you.
- Hey. Hey.

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.553
Ah...

01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:15.689
Great.

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.028
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:26.367
I'm sorry.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:28.402
It's just...

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.104
You look just like my mother.

01:23:30.206 --> 01:23:31.472
I do?
