<i>My name is Melinda Gordon.</i>

00:12.243 --> 00:13.243
<i>I just got married,</i>

00:13.417 --> 00:14.817
<i>just moved to a small town,</i>

00:14.960 --> 00:16.560
<i>just opened up an antique shop.</i>

00:17.120 --> 00:18.420
<i>I might be just like you.</i>

00:19.967 --> 00:21.870
<i>Except from the time that I was a little girl,</i>

00:21.871 --> 00:23.771
<i>I knew that I could talk to the dead.</i>

00:25.071 --> 00:26.221
<i>It's all right, honey.</i>

00:26.319 --> 00:28.719
<i>Earthbound spirits, my grandmother called them,</i>

00:28.816 --> 00:32.372
<i>the ones who have not crossed over because they have unfinished business with the living,</i>

00:32.371 --> 00:33.873
<i>and they come to me for help.</i>

00:35.307 --> 00:36.407
<i>To tell you my story,</i>

00:36.964 --> 00:38.310
<i>I have to tell you theirs.</i>

01:08.187 --> 01:09.522
- So, will you do it?
- No.

01:10.267 --> 01:11.212
Not fair.

01:11.406 --> 01:14.221
You know, I have told you a thousand times I'm not telling your boss his dead,

01:14.226 --> 01:17.622
disgruntled employee put a hex on him. First of all, there's no such thing.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.721
He doesn't know that!

01:18.748 --> 01:21.080
You know, there are people waiting for you in the light-- go.

01:21.086 --> 01:22.430
You're not the boss of me.

01:22.527 --> 01:23.472
Real mature, Gary.

01:27.947 --> 01:29.193
Don't marry him, Elaine.

01:29.217 --> 01:31.613
He just wants our money. I know guys like this.

01:31.735 --> 01:32.683
Conrad.

01:37.705 --> 01:38.653
Good morning.

01:41.206 --> 01:42.943
- So, did you talk to her?
- Your wife?

01:42.947 --> 01:44.492
Yes, my wife at the rest home.

01:44.926 --> 01:47.893
I'm sorry, I've been really busy, but I will try to get out there this weekend.

01:47.898 --> 01:49.660
- I promise.
- Sure, don't worry about me.

01:49.668 --> 01:53.163
I've only been dead for 50 years. I've got all the time in the world!

01:53.848 --> 01:55.350
- Ah, good morning.
- Hey!

01:55.797 --> 01:57.392
- How you doing?
- Oh, you know.

01:57.597 --> 01:58.593
Same old, same old.

02:03.885 --> 02:05.982
You know, you seem suspiciously cheerful.

02:06.718 --> 02:08.150
Hmm, do I?

02:11.438 --> 02:12.382
Oh, well.

02:13.526 --> 02:15.120
I met somebody the other night.

02:15.438 --> 02:16.380
Do tell.

02:16.397 --> 02:19.243
Ok, he's a teacher at the high school, but at night he's

02:19.265 --> 02:22.463
this unbelievable spoken word poet. You have to hear his stuff.

02:22.695 --> 02:23.641
He's handsome.

02:23.988 --> 02:24.931
He's sensitive.

02:24.986 --> 02:26.301
- And he's tall.
- Sold!

02:27.337 --> 02:30.611
Actually he's performing tonight at this poetry slam thing in Bay Ridge.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.171
- Do you want to go?
- Absolutely.

02:32.175 --> 02:34.263
I want to meet the guy that has you looking like this.

02:34.265 --> 02:35.213
Like what?

02:35.228 --> 02:38.173
Like you just grabbed the gold ring on the merry-go-round.

02:45.938 --> 02:47.081
You know, like really.

02:48.388 --> 02:50.132
Um, so should we take my car to the reading?

02:50.135 --> 02:52.772
Uh, no, I should probably drive on my own. Otherwise I'll have to double back.

02:52.777 --> 02:54.571
Oh, ok. You have the directions, right?

02:54.577 --> 02:55.523
- Yes.
- Ok.

02:56.286 --> 02:57.230
Evening, ma'am.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.170
There's a chill in the air tonight.

03:00.177 --> 03:01.773
That's why I have on my jacket.

03:09.646 --> 03:10.991
I'm not even gonna ask.

03:11.526 --> 03:12.472
Yeah.

03:12.476 --> 03:13.422
- Ok.
- Ok.

03:14.938 --> 03:16.581
- See you there.
- See you there.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.820
You.

03:46.005 --> 03:47.553
You're the one who can see us.

03:48.655 --> 03:49.600
Do I know you?

03:50.646 --> 03:51.591
It was a cemetery.

03:54.018 --> 03:54.961
Melinda.

05:23.968 --> 05:26.722
No one saw what happened? There were no witnesses?

05:29.236 --> 05:30.890
I should have made her ride with me.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.901
Hey, come on, 'drea, how could you know?

05:32.905 --> 05:34.131
Where is the doctor?

05:35.645 --> 05:37.933
I need some answers. I can't just sit here.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.323
Calm down.

05:39.626 --> 05:41.702
Don't tell me to calm down. I'm her mother.

05:41.706 --> 05:45.292
I know the people at this hospital. She's gonna get the best care. Believe me.

05:45.295 --> 05:48.731
- Jim.
- Hey. How is she?

05:50.397 --> 05:52.441
There's been some intracranial swelling.

05:53.727 --> 05:54.672
Yeah?

05:54.897 --> 05:57.991
And she's in a light coma at the moment, but I have every hope--

05:57.995 --> 05:59.942
Doctor, I'm a nurse. He's a paramedic.

06:00.595 --> 06:02.943
You don't have to play the happy game with us.

06:03.776 --> 06:04.802
A coma is a coma.

06:07.976 --> 06:08.922
All right.

06:09.377 --> 06:10.970
What's next? What do we do now?

06:11.278 --> 06:12.241
Well, for now we

06:13.116 --> 06:15.700
monitor her vital signs carefully and wait.

07:02.626 --> 07:03.570
What was that?

07:04.647 --> 07:05.592
Jim?

07:07.617 --> 07:08.560
Andrea?

07:09.357 --> 07:10.351
Where is everybody?

07:13.127 --> 07:14.230
Mom, I'm scared.

07:24.467 --> 07:25.412
Come on, dear.

07:26.638 --> 07:28.050
We'll go into it together.

07:33.908 --> 07:35.110
No. Hear me.

07:36.405 --> 07:37.353
Don't leave me.

07:41.996 --> 07:42.943
Don't leave me.

07:53.048 --> 07:53.992
I'm sorry.

07:54.767 --> 07:55.711
Grandma,  I can't.

07:57.156 --> 07:58.102
Not yet.

07:58.615 --> 07:59.812
That's all right, dear.

08:00.518 --> 08:01.562
All in good time.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.681
Jim.

08:27.835 --> 08:28.783
I saw it.

08:30.738 --> 08:31.680
I saw the light.

08:32.748 --> 08:33.690
Oh, God.

08:44.838 --> 08:46.043
Guys, this is ridiculous.

08:46.045 --> 08:48.261
I rested for a week in the hospital. I'm fine.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.211
Oh, yeah? Really?

08:49.807 --> 08:51.503
What happened the night you fell?

08:51.687 --> 08:53.330
- Do you remember?
- Not exactly.

08:53.645 --> 08:54.592
Where's Homer?

08:54.686 --> 08:55.811
Homer? Who's Homer?

08:57.726 --> 08:58.673
Uh, he's our dog.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.750
Sort  of.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.312
Actually, he's a ghost dog.

09:01.705 --> 09:03.741
A ghost dog! How cute!

09:05.075 --> 09:09.222
I bet you are hungry after that hospital food. I'm gonna fix you a nice breakfast.

09:11.476 --> 09:13.432
- What is with her?
- I don't know.

09:13.637 --> 09:16.802
She's so cheerful. What happened to the woman who couldn't bear to hear about ghosts?

09:16.805 --> 09:18.001
She is freaking me out.

09:18.157 --> 09:21.053
Well, she did stay up all night in the hospital wondering if she'd ever talk

09:21.058 --> 09:23.612
to her daughter again. That would make anybody cheerful. Where are you going?

09:23.615 --> 09:24.683
Wait, no, no. Go back.

09:24.687 --> 09:25.633
No,  come on.

09:29.788 --> 09:31.310
- Well, that's funny.
- What?

09:32.148 --> 09:34.091
- Gary's not out there.
- Remind me.

09:34.617 --> 09:37.723
- He wants me to tell his boss--
- oh, yeah, there's a hex on him. Right.

09:37.728 --> 09:41.080
Yeah, well, he's been out there every morning since he died a few months ago.

09:41.086 --> 09:42.203
Well, maybe he gave up.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.373
No, he's not the giving up type.

09:43.378 --> 09:46.190
And you know what's weird is I have not seen one ghost in a whole week.

09:46.195 --> 09:47.441
Maybe they're just being considerate.

09:47.447 --> 09:50.150
Ghosts are a lot of things. Considerate is not one of them.

09:50.157 --> 09:52.023
- Coffee or tea, darling?
- Coffee.

09:53.878 --> 09:56.570
Apparently a lot of things are weird. You know, when I go back to work tomorrow--

09:56.576 --> 09:59.512
Whoa, whoa. No, no. No going back to work. You just got out of the hospital.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.462
I'm fine.

10:00.546 --> 10:04.412
Besides, that week I was in the hospital was the most boring month of my life.

10:04.418 --> 10:05.580
Boredom is underrated.

10:06.168 --> 10:07.110
Boredom is boring,

10:07.378 --> 10:09.343
ok? And you can't stop me, so don't even try.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.643
- Three days a week.
- No.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.363
Half-days. That's my final offer.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.463
- Or what?
- Or I will withhold

10:15.051 --> 10:16.443
my husbandly attention.

10:16.787 --> 10:18.387
- You don't mean that.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.524 --> 10:21.620
- Give me strength.
- You don't mean that.

10:22.445 --> 10:23.840
All right, fine. Half-days.

10:24.526 --> 10:26.071
Ah, she gave in to my superior will.

10:26.076 --> 10:28.402
Yeah, but my first half-day starts today.

10:29.548 --> 10:31.722
Ah, what are you gonna do? It's a sunday.

10:32.008 --> 10:33.912
Open mail. Smell the lotion.

10:36.217 --> 10:37.841
You really do love this place, don't you.

10:37.847 --> 10:38.791
I do!

10:39.047 --> 10:42.193
It's beautiful, look, the rain has washed everything so clean.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.192
- This is definitely weird.
- What?

10:49.568 --> 10:50.712
The regulars are gone.

10:51.008 --> 10:51.860
The regulars?

10:51.866 --> 10:52.841
Yeah, the cranky guy,

10:52.848 --> 10:54.870
the boy pushing the thing.

10:55.678 --> 10:56.670
Rancher on a horse.

10:57.608 --> 10:59.532
Oh. Do you really see that many ghosts from other times?

10:59.535 --> 11:01.191
Sure. I just block them out.

11:02.348 --> 11:05.212
Oh, you know who that is? That's Mr. Keeler. Gary's boss.

11:05.217 --> 11:06.732
He's the guy with a hex on him, huh?

11:06.737 --> 11:08.580
He doesn't really have a hex on him.

11:11.597 --> 11:12.542
Mr. Keeler!

11:16.508 --> 11:17.651
- You all right?
- No!

11:17.956 --> 11:21.550
First these punks deface my property. Now the building's falling apart.

11:22.308 --> 11:24.582
Just one piece of bad luck after another.

11:26.585 --> 11:27.533
What? Honey?

11:27.667 --> 11:29.033
Gary's up there. He has to be.

11:29.037 --> 11:31.423
Gary, you come down here and show yourself right now!

11:31.427 --> 11:32.563
Honey, honey, calm down.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.472
No, this is crazy. Why can't I see him?

11:34.478 --> 11:37.020
He was just up there. He made the thing come down.

11:40.277 --> 11:41.220
What if it's me?

11:42.555 --> 11:44.953
Think about it. I haven't seen one ghost since the accident,

11:44.978 --> 11:48.210
not even in the hospital. What if the ghosts are really here, right in front of me,

11:48.215 --> 11:51.963
- and I just can't see them anymore?
- Shh, honey. Come on. It's all right.

11:52.697 --> 11:54.043
You're gonna be all right.

11:58.177 --> 12:00.573
You're telling me you don't see a single ghost?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.443
It's so weird. I've seen ghosts all my life. I mean,

12:03.597 --> 12:07.233
it's bizarre to know that they're out there and not be able to communicate with them.

12:07.237 --> 12:08.831
How do you think this happened?

12:10.087 --> 12:11.231
The accident, I guess.

12:11.968 --> 12:13.912
Some people lose their sense of smell.

12:13.948 --> 12:14.892
I lose my gift.

12:15.587 --> 12:18.131
- You think it's gonna come back?
- God, I hope so.

12:19.096 --> 12:20.442
Jim seems relieved though.

12:21.317 --> 12:23.420
Maybe he's happy you're alive, Melinda.

12:24.098 --> 12:27.742
Still, I don't think I should tell him how much the whole thing bugs me.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.251
I don't know. I just look around, and everything looks so...

12:31.997 --> 12:32.941
empty.

12:33.865 --> 12:35.861
I don't know how people live like this.

12:36.485 --> 12:38.523
I'm doing all right. Thank you very much.

12:38.528 --> 12:41.652
- Oh, yeah. The poet.
- Yes, the poet. Ashton.

12:42.548 --> 12:44.140
Right, I never got to meet him.

12:44.556 --> 12:48.320
You know, actually he has another poetry slam thing coming up right across the square.

12:48.327 --> 12:50.421
Good. I will be there for sure this time.

12:50.795 --> 12:51.743
Melinda?

12:53.047 --> 12:54.290
I hope you recognize me.

12:54.987 --> 12:56.883
Of course. Diane, hi!

12:57.625 --> 12:58.573
How are you?

12:59.526 --> 13:00.820
Question is, how are you?

13:01.165 --> 13:02.163
Oh, everything's...

13:02.768 --> 13:03.712
it's fine.

13:04.078 --> 13:05.602
- You remember Andrea?
- Yes,

13:06.157 --> 13:07.301
good to see you again.

13:08.675 --> 13:09.623
Could I, uh...

13:11.355 --> 13:12.502
could I have a minute?

13:13.187 --> 13:14.133
Sure.

13:14.708 --> 13:15.650
It's my niece.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.831
Her boyfriend died last week. It was very sudden.

13:20.977 --> 13:22.631
Oh, I'm so sorry.

13:23.858 --> 13:24.802
Please sit.

13:27.536 --> 13:28.730
- It's hot.
- Thank you.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.771
I'm not exactly sure how to say this.

13:34.895 --> 13:38.941
You remember how skeptical I was when you brought me together with my boy Jason?

13:39.666 --> 13:41.463
Sometimes it takes a leap of faith.

13:42.977 --> 13:44.420
Caitlin is acting strange.

13:45.675 --> 13:47.820
She sees things and hears things. She's...

13:49.627 --> 13:52.172
so you think she's being haunted by her boyfriend?

13:53.537 --> 13:55.330
Thank you for not making me say it.

13:56.446 --> 13:58.643
So you want me to talk to the boy's spirit?

13:59.736 --> 14:01.780
Or let Caitlin speak to him through you.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.773
I think it will give her peace.

14:06.975 --> 14:08.283
Diane, I'm uh...

14:11.325 --> 14:14.821
going through something right now that I don't really understand yet.

14:17.156 --> 14:22.203
Um, my gift is not very strong at the moment, and I'm not seeing--

14:23.576 --> 14:24.523
Melinda.

14:24.928 --> 14:27.922
My brother, he doesn't understand what she's going through,

14:28.746 --> 14:30.552
and their relationship is strained.

14:31.367 --> 14:32.911
If you could just talk to her,

14:33.827 --> 14:35.421
just let her know that she's...

14:37.256 --> 14:38.200
she's not crazy.

14:45.416 --> 14:48.060
Your aunt said that you've been having a rough time.

14:48.397 --> 14:50.340
She said you talked to my cousin Jason

14:51.008 --> 14:52.353
after he was already dead.

14:52.938 --> 14:53.882
Yes, I did.

14:55.638 --> 14:57.783
Are you some sort of psychic or something?

14:58.525 --> 14:59.463
No.

14:59.986 --> 15:00.930
It's different.

15:04.266 --> 15:05.402
Is Brian here now?

15:06.367 --> 15:07.313
Can you see him?

15:08.667 --> 15:09.613
No.

15:10.046 --> 15:11.091
I hear his heartbeat

15:11.786 --> 15:12.730
all the time,

15:12.976 --> 15:14.172
even when I'm sleeping.

15:14.358 --> 15:17.652
In my dreams I can see him, and he's trying to tell me something.

15:18.668 --> 15:19.611
Can you help me?

15:21.087 --> 15:22.030
I hope so.

15:22.988 --> 15:23.933
Is that him?

15:32.758 --> 15:34.303
I think I might have seen him.

15:35.397 --> 15:36.340
Really?

15:36.726 --> 15:37.670
Where?

15:38.135 --> 15:39.332
Tell me more about him.

15:40.635 --> 15:41.582
Brian?

15:42.317 --> 15:43.473
Brian was fantastic.

15:44.016 --> 15:46.913
No one ever thought he would go out with anybody like me,

15:47.008 --> 15:50.503
but  from the minute Brian and I sat next to each other in chem class,

15:51.226 --> 15:52.173
we just clicked.

15:53.828 --> 15:57.772
At first I thought he just liked me because I helped him understand chemistry.

15:58.885 --> 16:02.010
And then I realized he really liked me for me.

16:04.705 --> 16:09.002
Homecoming was two weeks away, and he finally admitted he didn't want to go

16:09.437 --> 16:10.783
because he couldn't dance.

16:11.255 --> 16:14.253
And I said that was silly. I mean, no one can dance really.

16:14.528 --> 16:16.422
You just kind of move back and forth.

16:16.886 --> 16:17.832
So we made a deal.

16:18.558 --> 16:22.201
I would go watch him practice football if he would take me to the dance.

16:25.937 --> 16:27.633
And it was the day of homecoming,

16:27.756 --> 16:29.500
and I had just picked up my dress,

16:30.146 --> 16:31.460
and I was so excited.

16:35.665 --> 16:37.063
She was cheerleader pretty.

16:38.426 --> 16:41.422
Just the kind of girl that you would expect him to be with.

16:42.258 --> 16:44.251
I felt like my heart was gonna explode,

16:44.776 --> 16:46.071
like I'd die on the spot.

16:46.695 --> 16:49.711
Brian  kept calling, and I knew I had to face him.

16:50.136 --> 16:51.731
Caitlin, I need to talk to you.

16:53.787 --> 16:56.033
I guess I was hoping for something to happen

16:56.655 --> 16:58.352
that would make things different.

16:59.565 --> 17:00.513
And then it did.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.913
There's a place in the heart,

17:29.955 --> 17:31.451
and if you hit it hard enough

17:31.658 --> 17:32.852
at just the right spot,

17:33.408 --> 17:34.422
it stops beating.

17:51.637 --> 17:53.081
I knew even before I saw him

17:55.057 --> 17:56.003
he was gone.

18:03.477 --> 18:07.323
And I went under the bleachers to cry 'cause I didn't want anyone to see me.

18:09.908 --> 18:12.002
I just couldn't believe that he was gone.

18:13.465 --> 18:16.111
I couldn't get that look on his face out of my head.

18:17.645 --> 18:20.942
And then I realized I would never know what he wanted to tell me.

18:21.288 --> 18:23.380
Was he gonna be honest? Was he gonna lie?

18:24.875 --> 18:26.271
Was he breaking up with me?

18:28.668 --> 18:29.811
I thought he loved me.

18:30.028 --> 18:31.671
I mean, I thought I was the one.

18:33.716 --> 18:34.662
It's ok.

18:35.126 --> 18:36.073
Caitlin.

18:38.407 --> 18:39.350
What do you want?

18:40.675 --> 18:42.971
I guess I just want to know if he's out there

18:43.855 --> 18:45.331
and if he really loved me,

18:46.355 --> 18:48.903
and if he didn't, I want to know what I did wrong.

18:57.325 --> 18:58.323
I dreamt about him.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.722
I saw this tiger come charging towards me.

19:02.337 --> 19:04.582
That was the name of their team: The tigers.

19:05.528 --> 19:06.720
And you saw the jersey?

19:07.357 --> 19:10.253
I think I saw Brian too. Right before I had the accident.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.431
My heart broke for her.

19:13.487 --> 19:15.781
Losing your first love like that so suddenly.

19:16.005 --> 19:17.503
So this is where it happened?

19:17.858 --> 19:18.802
Yeah.

19:19.345 --> 19:22.190
I thought if I came back here I might pick up something,

19:22.197 --> 19:23.750
like a feeling. Anything.

19:24.777 --> 19:25.723
And?

19:26.417 --> 19:27.363
Nothing.

19:27.855 --> 19:28.802
At least not--

19:32.446 --> 19:33.393
wait.

20:07.375 --> 20:08.321
No.

20:08.408 --> 20:09.513
- No!
- Caitlin!

20:10.707 --> 20:12.483
- What? What is it?
- It's breathing.

20:12.487 --> 20:13.683
What's breathing? What?

20:14.507 --> 20:17.073
The ball was breathing. It was--it was there!

20:17.867 --> 20:20.810
And the heartbeat, it just kept getting louder and louder.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.490
Oh, my god, I'm going crazy.

20:27.105 --> 20:31.383
Aunt Diane, it was Brian, I know it was. It's like he's dying all over again.

20:36.646 --> 20:37.890
That was a great night out.

20:37.898 --> 20:39.192
Yeah, the food was great.

20:39.948 --> 20:40.892
Not just the food.

20:41.987 --> 20:42.933
The peace.

20:43.485 --> 20:44.431
What do you mean?

20:44.517 --> 20:46.210
Remember that one restaurant we had to leave because

20:46.215 --> 20:49.503
the dead chef kept yelling about how bad the living chef was?

20:50.547 --> 20:51.892
I could barely get a bite.

20:52.557 --> 20:53.500
Oh, right.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.603
You're not fooling anybody, you know.

21:00.957 --> 21:01.901
What do you mean?

21:02.258 --> 21:05.250
Look, I know how miserable this makes you, losing you gift.

21:06.048 --> 21:07.793
Why are you pretending it doesn't?

21:10.545 --> 21:12.690
Because I thought it would make you happy.

21:13.456 --> 21:17.490
You know, to have a normal wife that you don't have to worry about all the time.

21:17.498 --> 21:19.090
I  thought it would be a relief.

21:23.248 --> 21:24.190
Look.

21:25.438 --> 21:26.590
I worry, I admit it.

21:30.476 --> 21:33.422
But I would rather have all the worry in the world than to

21:34.055 --> 21:35.801
see the light go out of your eyes.

21:38.355 --> 21:40.203
You can tell me how you really feel.

21:42.345 --> 21:43.292
I can't take it.

21:48.405 --> 21:49.553
How does a person just

21:50.328 --> 21:52.553
lose a piece of themselves like this?

21:56.018 --> 21:58.361
You know, making contacts with spirits, it's--

21:59.457 --> 22:01.601
it's what I did, it's how I helped people.

22:04.137 --> 22:06.933
And now I feel like I just don't know who I am anymore.

22:09.545 --> 22:12.780
And I tried to help this poor girl talk to her dead boyfriend, and I

22:12.787 --> 22:14.130
just feel like a big fake.

22:14.165 --> 22:15.440
- Hey, shh.
- I do.

22:18.466 --> 22:19.413
Give it time.

22:20.936 --> 22:21.880
People change.

22:24.185 --> 22:25.133
It's what life is.

22:27.266 --> 22:29.362
And that's what we have to make room for.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.913
I'll tell you one thing that'll never change.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.023
That's what gets me through.

23:29.937 --> 23:34.903
I know, it was my day off, and I suddenly realized I have never seen your shop before.

23:35.398 --> 23:36.540
Isn't that ridiculous?

23:38.295 --> 23:40.263
I hope you don't mind me popping in like this.

23:40.278 --> 23:42.153
No, mom, of course not. It's just...

23:43.745 --> 23:44.693
a surprise.

23:44.697 --> 23:46.513
Well, it's a surprise for me too.

23:46.945 --> 23:49.181
I've been looking back over these past few years,

23:49.197 --> 23:53.362
and I realized I have become completely housebound and I didn't even know it.

23:53.947 --> 23:57.670
Oh, this place is absolutely adorable.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.330
You girls do this all by yourself?

24:01.337 --> 24:02.361
Mom, are you

24:03.418 --> 24:05.580
- taking something?
- Taking something?

24:06.298 --> 24:07.240
Yeah, like a

24:07.588 --> 24:08.762
mood stabilizer.

24:09.956 --> 24:10.902
No, I'm just--

24:11.528 --> 24:15.200
I'm feeling really well lately. Even my migraines are completely gone.

24:18.808 --> 24:22.512
Excuse me, I'm looking for something in a pastel to go with my eyes.

24:24.115 --> 24:25.060
Right on time.

24:25.365 --> 24:27.781
Come on now. Only a fool would be late for lunch with you.

24:27.787 --> 24:28.780
You must be Ashton.

24:29.076 --> 24:32.710
Yes. Ashton Beluso this is Melinda Gordon and her mom Beth.

24:32.986 --> 24:33.932
Hello.

24:33.998 --> 24:37.292
Did she tell you that we're going to your slam poetry thing tomorrow night?

24:37.295 --> 24:40.233
Yes, she did, and I'm flattered, but I just

24:40.987 --> 24:42.880
hope that I don't fall off the stage.

24:43.617 --> 24:45.491
Oh, trust me, he owns the stage.

24:47.587 --> 24:48.971
Um, we're gonna go to lunch.

24:48.976 --> 24:50.221
Really nice to meet you.

24:50.415 --> 24:51.962
Nice to meet you too, Melinda.

24:52.145 --> 24:53.090
Mrs. Gordon.

24:53.877 --> 24:54.822
Bye.

24:59.387 --> 25:00.632
What a lovely young man.

25:01.775 --> 25:04.271
So nice to see two people so happy together.

25:10.558 --> 25:13.652
You know, you have a very interesting definition of half-day.

25:13.968 --> 25:16.252
Well, I had to entertain my mother for an hour.

25:16.255 --> 25:19.503
Then I needed an hour to come down from it. And then yet another

25:19.527 --> 25:23.520
wistful hour trying to figure out why she couldn't be this happy when I was 13.

25:23.546 --> 25:24.720
Well, better late than never.

25:24.728 --> 25:26.031
True. See you tomorrow.

25:26.795 --> 25:28.041
- Half-day.
- Yeah, yeah.

25:28.496 --> 25:29.440
Half!

25:58.605 --> 26:00.801
I don't think you want to do this, Caitlin.

26:01.115 --> 26:03.801
- Where did you come from?
- I work across the street.

26:03.808 --> 26:05.840
Look, will you please just leave me alone?

26:05.846 --> 26:06.540
Sure.

26:06.546 --> 26:10.590
You just suck that whole bottle down and then drive yourself home. Works for me.

26:13.188 --> 26:14.730
Fine. Have the car.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.320
- I know you're in pain.
- No, you don't know anything!

26:20.525 --> 26:23.893
- I just want it all to stop.
- Well, that's not the way to erase it.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.093
Well, it's worth a try.

26:25.478 --> 26:27.243
You know, you have people that love you.

26:27.248 --> 26:29.843
- Your aunt, your father.
- My father doesn't love me.

26:29.847 --> 26:32.041
He hates me because I remind him of my mom.

26:32.628 --> 26:33.973
Your aunt Diane loves you,

26:34.945 --> 26:38.162
and she lost her son. Do you really want to go breaking her heart

26:38.167 --> 26:39.410
by hurting yourself too?

26:40.535 --> 26:41.563
I just feel so

26:42.257 --> 26:43.203
empty.

26:43.856 --> 26:44.803
I know.

26:44.807 --> 26:46.763
I thought Brian was trying to reach me,

26:46.766 --> 26:48.660
and now I just think I'm going crazy.

26:48.716 --> 26:51.122
Hey, you're not. He's out there. I believe that.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.070
Whe-where is he ?

26:52.385 --> 26:54.923
Aunt Diane said you could show me. I need to talk to him.

26:54.925 --> 26:56.301
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

26:56.307 --> 26:58.100
Because something's happened to me.

26:58.386 --> 26:59.530
I stopped seeing them,

26:59.745 --> 27:02.043
and I don't know why. But you know, sometimes

27:02.058 --> 27:05.393
you just have to go on faith 'cause that's what I'm going on right now.

27:05.395 --> 27:08.190
Why don't you just face the fact they're not out there?

27:08.236 --> 27:09.530
There's nothing out there

27:10.035 --> 27:11.741
but nightmares and bad memories.

27:12.575 --> 27:13.521
That's not true.

27:13.557 --> 27:17.701
Yes, it is, and you might have fooled my aunt Diane, but you're not gonna fool me.

27:17.877 --> 27:18.821
You're a big fake,

27:19.267 --> 27:20.213
and I'm on to you.

27:20.636 --> 27:23.532
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me alone?

27:31.555 --> 27:32.853
Thank you for doing this.

27:33.197 --> 27:36.041
Any friend of my sister's... so you're hearing a rattle?

27:36.578 --> 27:37.611
All the time?

27:38.528 --> 27:41.522
No, just sometimes. Maybe it's the muffler or something.

27:43.686 --> 27:45.721
I really enjoyed meeting your daughter Caitlin.

27:45.726 --> 27:46.673
Oh, yeah?

27:46.957 --> 27:50.851
Well, you didn't have any luck figuring out what was wrong with her, did you.

27:51.256 --> 27:52.800
It's not that simple, I guess.

27:54.086 --> 27:55.032
I'm not surprised.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.102
She won't talk to me. She won't talk to Diane.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.870
Still, she does need your support.

28:00.078 --> 28:02.072
Caitlin doesn't look to me for support.

28:02.818 --> 28:05.082
She looks right through me, if you want to know the truth.

28:05.088 --> 28:07.420
Mr. Emerson, you may think that this is none of my business,

28:07.426 --> 28:11.520
but the one thing that I did find out about Caitlin is that she is very troubled,

28:11.938 --> 28:14.632
and she doesn't feel like she can talk to you about it.

28:14.635 --> 28:18.230
She thinks that you connect her with her mother and dislike her for it.

28:19.015 --> 28:19.960
She told you that?

28:22.765 --> 28:25.610
I can't get two words out of her. She told you all that.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.113
She's grieving, Mr. Emerson.

28:29.005 --> 28:30.723
She just lost somebody that she loved.

28:30.725 --> 28:33.123
I know something about loss myself, Ms. Gordon.

28:33.706 --> 28:35.600
My wife left me when Caitlin was two.

28:36.867 --> 28:38.562
I had to raise her all by myself.

28:39.716 --> 28:40.710
I provided for her,

28:42.048 --> 28:43.190
and I kept her safe.

28:44.906 --> 28:46.002
She's my little girl,

28:47.547 --> 28:48.843
and now she looks at me--

28:49.468 --> 28:52.320
she looks at me like she hates me. She looks at me

28:52.716 --> 28:55.070
like she can't wait to leave me too.

28:58.126 --> 28:59.072
I'm sorry.

29:00.328 --> 29:02.270
Nothing wrong with your car, is there.

29:09.575 --> 29:10.523
Have a nice day.

29:20.866 --> 29:22.213
Adam, a little compassion.

29:22.427 --> 29:26.853
Caitlin has had a traumatic experience, and sometimes shock can cause unusual behavior.

29:28.248 --> 29:30.743
We've just got to show her that we're here for her

29:30.745 --> 29:31.691
and that we care.

29:33.028 --> 29:34.120
You're a good sister.

29:34.338 --> 29:37.780
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here. This is way beyond me.

29:37.808 --> 29:39.801
Melinda Gordon has a very special gift.

29:40.768 --> 29:42.080
She helped me with Jason.

29:42.777 --> 29:44.623
I believe she can help Caitlin, too.

29:45.336 --> 29:46.683
Hope to hell you're right.

29:53.516 --> 29:54.462
I'm ok.

29:54.788 --> 29:55.732
I'm ok.

29:56.597 --> 29:57.541
I'm ok.

30:20.508 --> 30:21.452
Brian!

30:21.726 --> 30:22.670
Caitlin!

30:28.115 --> 30:29.513
Caitlin, what's the matter?

30:29.545 --> 30:30.841
What's the matter, honey?

30:31.428 --> 30:33.120
Everything is gonna be all right.

30:36.128 --> 30:40.702
All right, all right, all right. Ok, now it's time for a poetry lounge favorite.

30:41.037 --> 30:43.823
Writes some powerful stuff that I know y'all are gonna enjoy.

30:43.828 --> 30:48.101
So please put your hands together for my dog, Ashton Beluso, y'all!

30:48.577 --> 30:49.970
Give it up for Ashton, man.

30:53.128 --> 30:55.320
Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here.

30:55.655 --> 30:57.653
Like to say hello to two of my friends.

30:59.495 --> 31:00.492
This poem is called

31:01.146 --> 31:02.090
Agera.

31:04.738 --> 31:07.130
The wind is weirdly warm. It pulls and it rips.

31:07.436 --> 31:10.282
Departing spirits struggle with the silver coils of fog.

31:10.498 --> 31:11.990
Tormented souls are easy prey

31:12.788 --> 31:15.030
still being haunted by what might have been.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.792
The young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.

31:18.807 --> 31:20.053
The peaceful are immune.

31:21.115 --> 31:23.911
But who amongst us are in tune with that kind of peace?

31:24.315 --> 31:25.363
The man is laughing.

31:26.046 --> 31:28.350
Stand back and watch the hordes of these

31:28.575 --> 31:32.523
conflicted souls perform their final unconflicted act.

31:36.265 --> 31:37.263
You have no choice.

31:46.848 --> 31:50.341
That's what I'm talking about! One more time, man, for Ashton Beluso.

31:52.938 --> 31:53.880
Andrea.

31:54.617 --> 31:55.661
So what'd you think?

31:56.226 --> 31:57.212
It was crazy good.

31:57.777 --> 31:59.320
- You liked it.
- I loved it.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.573
Oh, it was so powerful. Don't you think, Melinda?

32:03.905 --> 32:06.100
I don't understand. Where did you get that?

32:06.495 --> 32:07.372
Get what?

32:07.375 --> 32:09.793
The part about the departing ghosts getting pulled away.

32:09.798 --> 32:11.393
The silvery fog and everything.

32:11.785 --> 32:13.982
Oh, this crazy dream I had the other night.

32:14.627 --> 32:15.571
There were these

32:15.878 --> 32:18.273
two dark figures in some kind of mass exodus.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.451
I don't know. I just write what comes to me, you know?

32:22.477 --> 32:26.581
So, look, I got to stay. One of my students is going up, and I promised I'd listen.

32:26.588 --> 32:27.732
So I'll see you later?

32:27.938 --> 32:28.880
- All right.
- Ok.

32:34.078 --> 32:35.370
I think he's a sensitive.

32:36.106 --> 32:37.283
- What?
- A sensitive.

32:38.028 --> 32:41.220
My grandma told me about them. I've only met one or two before.

32:41.776 --> 32:44.760
They're people that are somehow in tune with the larger picture.

32:44.778 --> 32:47.073
And they get a feeling about something before

32:47.488 --> 32:48.433
it even happens.

32:49.486 --> 32:51.040
Wow, I'm dating a sensitive.

32:51.588 --> 32:53.130
You know what? Ashton's dream?

32:53.427 --> 32:55.583
- I've seen it in real life.
- No way!

32:56.238 --> 32:59.251
The day I got into my accident, there was a ghost family in the road,

32:59.258 --> 33:03.503
and I stopped to try and help them, but they got whisked away just like Ashton said.

33:03.515 --> 33:06.591
How can he see them in a dream and I can't find Brian to save my life.

33:06.607 --> 33:07.750
I mean, it's not fair.

33:08.878 --> 33:11.621
I just wish that my grandmother was here so I could...

33:14.986 --> 33:15.933
What?

33:16.378 --> 33:18.822
I know who I'm gonna have to talk to about this.

33:21.988 --> 33:23.030
Mmm, it's delicious.

33:23.877 --> 33:25.422
I don't know. For some reason,

33:25.705 --> 33:28.252
everything is tasting so much better to me lately.

33:29.678 --> 33:30.922
Do you know why that is?

33:31.178 --> 33:34.172
No, I don't, but whatever it is, I'm not gonna question it.

33:34.805 --> 33:35.751
I wonder.

33:37.328 --> 33:39.662
I know that you don't like it when I bring up the spirit world...

33:39.668 --> 33:41.220
haven't seen a one.

33:42.116 --> 33:43.320
Haven't heard a thing.

33:43.918 --> 33:45.222
- Nothing?
- No.

33:46.057 --> 33:48.120
- Blessed silence.
- Interesting.

33:49.377 --> 33:51.323
I haven't either for about a week now.

33:51.585 --> 33:52.533
Really?

33:53.136 --> 33:55.942
Oh, this is wonderful. You must be so happy.

33:56.626 --> 33:58.172
No, mom, I'm not.

34:00.008 --> 34:01.820
I know, I know.

34:02.498 --> 34:03.832
You embrace your gift.

34:04.958 --> 34:08.139
Melinda, you can say this till the cows come home,

34:09.306 --> 34:11.130
but aren't you just a little bit relieved?

34:11.135 --> 34:12.083
No.

34:13.975 --> 34:14.920
Maybe it's like...

34:15.467 --> 34:17.562
allergies, you know? You grow out of it.

34:18.304 --> 34:20.201
You always had migraines, right?

34:21.128 --> 34:24.170
Because you were trying to suppress the visions, the sounds.

34:24.277 --> 34:25.850
But your headaches are gone now.

34:25.858 --> 34:27.041
What if there aren't any

34:27.047 --> 34:31.141
visions or sounds to suppress? What if the spirits themselves have just vanished?

34:31.846 --> 34:32.792
Couldn't be.

34:33.288 --> 34:37.060
They're all around us, always. That is what is so annoying about them.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.942
Do you really feel annoyed,

34:39.286 --> 34:42.083
mom? Because to me you've never seemed so lighthearted.

34:42.187 --> 34:46.081
Does it really seem likely that we would both lose our gift at the same time?

34:46.205 --> 34:47.400
So what are you saying?

34:48.574 --> 34:50.021
They've gone somewhere else?

34:51.467 --> 34:53.032
I don't know. Maybe. Yeah.

34:53.667 --> 34:54.612
For good?

34:56.495 --> 34:57.443
I hope not.

35:06.578 --> 35:07.672
Ok, this is all good.

35:08.126 --> 35:11.000
But I don't want you to overdo it just 'cause you feel good.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.862
Let's remember you suffered a head trauma, so the slightest symptom

35:13.865 --> 35:15.393
and you tell Jim right away.

35:16.665 --> 35:18.610
There isn't anything I don't tell Jim.

35:19.037 --> 35:19.980
Ok.

35:23.665 --> 35:24.661
Is that really true

35:25.197 --> 35:26.693
that you tell Jim everything?

35:27.248 --> 35:28.193
Yeah, why?

35:28.565 --> 35:30.133
Mmm, I'm surprised, I guess.

35:31.336 --> 35:33.860
I never told your father about my visions.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.560
I was afraid it would be too disturbing.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.000
Course he ended up leaving me anyway, so

35:39.635 --> 35:42.983
- so much for my instincts on that one.
- You never talk about him.

35:44.407 --> 35:45.351
Why should I?

35:45.905 --> 35:47.000
He's out of our life.

35:49.307 --> 35:51.051
But I must say in retrospect,

35:51.547 --> 35:52.893
maybe if I had told him...

35:54.415 --> 35:56.911
Course it's water under the bridge now, isn't it.

35:57.528 --> 35:58.952
Time of death, 14:35.

36:09.227 --> 36:10.171
Mom,

36:10.585 --> 36:11.533
did you see that?

36:12.957 --> 36:13.903
What?

36:14.465 --> 36:15.412
No.

36:20.128 --> 36:21.073
Yes.

36:23.307 --> 36:24.771
Yes, I did.

36:34.978 --> 36:36.350
Andrea, I saw one.

36:36.918 --> 36:38.031
You did? Where?

36:38.257 --> 36:41.041
At the hospital. I never lost my gift. They've just gone away.

36:41.045 --> 36:42.541
But I don't get it. Where to?

36:42.578 --> 36:44.072
No idea. One thing at a time.

36:44.747 --> 36:47.340
Wow, this probably sounds like an odd conversation.

36:47.686 --> 36:48.632
No, no.

36:50.628 --> 36:51.572
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:51.688 --> 36:52.681
She'll explain it to you.

36:52.685 --> 36:55.712
Ashton, you wouldn't happen to have a copy of your poem with you, would you?

36:55.716 --> 36:57.820
My poem? No, it's all in my head.

36:58.756 --> 37:01.492
I'm trying to remember this part about who can resist the wind force.

37:01.497 --> 37:04.213
You said the tortured ghosts went immediately, and the young ones--

37:04.226 --> 37:07.202
The young and the passionate resist the best-- sometimes for days.

37:07.205 --> 37:10.902
Right, sometimes for days! Which means that I still have time. Thank you.

37:11.016 --> 37:12.660
Wait, wait! Where are you going?

37:13.568 --> 37:15.612
Brian's still out there. I'm sure of it.

37:15.757 --> 37:16.700
I just missed him.

37:22.478 --> 37:24.470
Ok, this is gonna take some explaining.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.010
Yeah.

37:30.348 --> 37:31.170
Melinda.

37:31.175 --> 37:32.171
I can help Caitlin.

37:32.488 --> 37:34.982
- I wasn't sure before.
- What are you doing here?

37:35.577 --> 37:38.173
I'm absolutely sure that Brian is still earthbound.

37:38.535 --> 37:40.883
What part of "leave me alone" is hard for you?

37:40.945 --> 37:44.181
The part where I have to abandon somebody that I know I can help.

37:44.186 --> 37:45.242
I'm sorry, I won't do it.

37:45.245 --> 37:46.143
Aunt Diane.

37:46.145 --> 37:48.390
Melinda, maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

37:48.418 --> 37:51.613
I mean, Caitlin has resisted, and you're going through your own loss of abilities.

37:51.616 --> 37:54.050
No, I won't lose faith in my gift anymore.

37:55.265 --> 37:58.312
I know I can help you find Brian, but you have to come with me right now.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.262
No!

37:59.125 --> 38:01.850
Just stop it, ok? I just need to be left alone.

38:02.695 --> 38:03.643
Caitlin...

38:05.006 --> 38:05.953
you listen to her.

38:07.058 --> 38:08.930
Aunt Diane told me what she can do.

38:09.708 --> 38:12.153
I don't know if i believe in all that stuff, but

38:12.487 --> 38:13.783
I think maybe you should.

38:14.228 --> 38:15.671
Dad, what are you talking about?

38:15.677 --> 38:17.173
Honey, I know you're in pain.

38:18.407 --> 38:20.201
I know I haven't been here for you,

38:20.715 --> 38:22.713
but I know this boy means a lot to you.

38:24.287 --> 38:25.433
I understand that now.

38:27.227 --> 38:28.571
And I don't want this pain

38:28.986 --> 38:30.920
eating you up inside, Caitlin.

38:31.328 --> 38:32.470
If you can find peace,

38:33.355 --> 38:34.752
that's what I want for you.

38:35.917 --> 38:37.613
Daddy, it hurts so bad.

38:39.186 --> 38:40.451
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

38:42.408 --> 38:43.352
I know.

38:44.676 --> 38:46.022
Oh, you're my little girl.

38:46.975 --> 38:48.222
You're everything to me.

38:49.805 --> 38:50.751
Thank you.

38:56.098 --> 38:58.543
I came here once before, but I gave up too soon.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.753
Something is pulling the spirits away, Caitlin,

39:00.757 --> 39:02.603
but the young and strong can resist.

39:03.766 --> 39:05.151
Brian is here. I know it.

39:06.095 --> 39:07.550
- I just know he is.
- Ok.

39:08.157 --> 39:09.101
Come on.

39:22.365 --> 39:23.311
My ring!

39:24.376 --> 39:25.323
It's here.

39:26.787 --> 39:27.780
Caitlin, he's here.

39:29.005 --> 39:29.953
Brian is?

39:30.377 --> 39:31.323
Right now?

39:32.118 --> 39:33.810
Your ring, it acted as an anchor.

39:34.256 --> 39:36.313
Sometimes ghosts can attach themselves to things

39:36.315 --> 39:39.161
that have a deeper meaning to them. It can give them strength.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.080
Something's been trying to pull me away.

39:41.085 --> 39:42.032
Something bad.

39:44.457 --> 39:47.200
Let's get out of here. That wind could start up again.

39:57.325 --> 39:59.641
Please tell her. I didn't want to break up with her.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.493
He didn't want to break up, Caitlin.

40:01.597 --> 40:02.541
He didn't?

40:04.105 --> 40:05.053
Who was that girl?

40:05.978 --> 40:07.872
The one I saw him with in the street.

40:09.177 --> 40:11.163
Caitlin, she was my dance teacher.

40:12.505 --> 40:13.521
Your dance teacher?

40:14.395 --> 40:15.343
His dance teacher?

40:17.845 --> 40:18.793
Oh, my god.

40:19.576 --> 40:21.722
He was learning how to dance just for me?

40:22.468 --> 40:23.863
I wanted to make you happy.

40:24.436 --> 40:27.603
I wanted to be able to dance with you and not look like an idiot.

40:27.607 --> 40:29.253
He was trying to make you happy.

40:29.996 --> 40:32.141
- He thought his dancing was--
- horrible.

40:33.527 --> 40:35.880
I just saw her, and she looked so pretty.

40:38.696 --> 40:41.292
And I was afraid that you woke up and realized that

40:41.636 --> 40:43.580
you shouldn't be with someone like me.

40:44.155 --> 40:48.503
Caitlin, I woke up every day and realized how lucky I was to be with someone like you.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.253
Didn't you know that?

40:50.605 --> 40:52.053
Didn't you know I loved you?

40:52.307 --> 40:54.653
He wants you to know that he woke up every day

40:55.316 --> 40:57.262
thinking how lucky he was to have you.

40:58.745 --> 41:01.341
He wants to know if you knew how much he loved you.

41:01.417 --> 41:02.360
I know now.

41:04.908 --> 41:05.852
Brian,

41:06.037 --> 41:08.280
I don't know how I'm gonna live without you.

41:09.065 --> 41:12.610
You're the only person that I've ever met that's made me feel special.

41:13.918 --> 41:14.861
Like I count.

41:17.646 --> 41:19.290
Tell her she'll find that again.

41:21.057 --> 41:22.503
Tell her that I want her to.

41:23.907 --> 41:24.850
For me.

41:24.978 --> 41:27.022
He believes that you'll find that again,

41:27.525 --> 41:28.973
and he wants you to for him.

41:29.355 --> 41:31.450
I will never find anyone like you, Brian.

41:32.365 --> 41:33.613
You learned how to dance

41:34.475 --> 41:35.421
just for me!

41:39.477 --> 41:41.322
And now we'll never get that chance.

41:49.038 --> 41:50.333
Caitlin, close your eyes.

41:50.627 --> 41:52.171
- What?
- Just close your eyes.

41:53.936 --> 41:54.882
Brian...

41:55.836 --> 41:57.880
I want you to take Caitlin in your arms.

41:58.807 --> 41:59.751
For real?

42:00.006 --> 42:00.953
For real.

42:01.676 --> 42:05.442
It may take her a minute to feel it, but I want you to show her what you learned.

42:05.446 --> 42:08.641
And you have to be open to this, Caitlin, ok? Just trust Brian.

42:09.536 --> 42:10.483
I do.

42:12.477 --> 42:13.423
Ok, Brian.

42:19.547 --> 42:20.492
I feel him.

42:23.498 --> 42:25.443
It's called a box step. Pretty simple.

42:26.946 --> 42:27.890
It's the box step.

43:19.658 --> 43:20.952
And then he crossed over?

43:21.026 --> 43:22.122
Then he crossed over.

43:23.636 --> 43:24.580
That's beautiful.

43:24.625 --> 43:26.172
Yeah, it was something to see.

43:26.598 --> 43:27.540
The power of love.

43:28.637 --> 43:29.631
Strong stuff, love.

43:31.447 --> 43:32.321
Something

43:32.326 --> 43:33.671
I know a little bit about.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.292
Hey, what about your regulars? They come back yet?

43:37.776 --> 43:39.472
- Where is Homer?
- Still missing.

43:39.968 --> 43:40.912
All of them.

43:41.346 --> 43:44.740
But at least we know I didn't lose my gift. I saw two ghosts today.

43:45.257 --> 43:47.363
Look at how she sparkles when she says that.

43:47.366 --> 43:50.010
Yeah, I'll admit it. I enjoy being back in the game.

43:54.116 --> 43:55.112
Although that wind,

43:56.637 --> 43:58.521
it was warm and so creepy.

44:01.508 --> 44:03.800
- What do you think it means?
- I wish I knew.

44:20.006 --> 44:24.001
