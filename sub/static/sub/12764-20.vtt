00:00.910 --> 00:02.180
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.210 --> 00:03.750
My mom and I talked,

00:03.780 --> 00:05.380
She won't let me see you outside
of school for awhile.

00:05.410 --> 00:06.380
She could be you.

00:06.410 --> 00:07.410
What?

00:07.450 --> 00:08.710
The two of you

00:08.750 --> 00:10.610
Used to play that song all the time.

00:10.650 --> 00:11.610
It's not there.

00:11.650 --> 00:13.610
It's their song, D4,

00:13.650 --> 00:15.150
It's the missing record from the jukebox.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.650
Where did you get this?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.150
I found it in my room.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.080
I'm trying to book the DJ for an event.

00:20.110 --> 00:21.310
A prom?

00:21.350 --> 00:22.410
You're DJ Spinbrandt?

00:22.450 --> 00:24.350
And I don't do proms.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.480
Oh my god, I can't believe I got
into this whole mess over you!

00:26.510 --> 00:27.850
How sweet is this?

00:27.880 --> 00:29.180
That's awesome.

00:29.210 --> 00:30.680
You're awesome.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.350
You're kind of awesome, too.

00:32.380 --> 00:34.580
Maybe I am lazy and I lack study skills,

00:34.610 --> 00:36.280
but I've changed,

00:36.310 --> 00:37.880
And I'm going to do something
important with my life

00:37.910 --> 00:39.050
and make a difference.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.110
You don't know how Sarah died.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.250
She was just like you.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.250
Trying too much, too fast,

00:43.280 --> 00:45.780
and when she tried something she
wasn't ready for, it killed her.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.480
You can't keep doing this to yourself.

00:47.510 --> 00:48.550
Promise me you'll stop.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.150
I promise...

00:52.180 --> 00:54.010
I'm going in for my check-up tomorrow,

00:54.050 --> 00:55.880
It'll tell me if I'm better or not.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.780
Andy, everything's going to be okay.

00:59.550 --> 01:01.180
You know, when you say it,

01:01.210 --> 01:03.650
I almost believe it.

01:14.180 --> 01:17.610
When we sleep, the subconscious
mind takes over.

01:17.650 --> 01:21.610
Our dreams can reveal what is
disturbing us in our waking hours,

01:21.650 --> 01:26.210
And there are rare occasions in
the state between sleep and consciousness,

01:26.250 --> 01:27.880
When the things that most trouble us

01:27.910 --> 01:29.950
can emerge.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.710
Stephen,

01:37.750 --> 01:39.310
what are you doing?

01:41.980 --> 01:43.380
Happy anniversary.

01:43.410 --> 01:47.150
That's the brace I loved at the art fair.

01:47.180 --> 01:49.250
Yeah, I grabbed the designer's card.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.550
I just ruined your surprise.

01:51.580 --> 01:55.110
Hey, it's not the only thing
I have up my sleeve.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.780
I'm making us dinner tomorrow night.

01:57.810 --> 02:00.580
And for dessert...

02:00.610 --> 02:02.850
I thought we'd have these.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.479
Kyle, what are you doing up?

02:09.509 --> 02:12.450
I can't tell what it is yet.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.950
I think he's sleepwalking.

02:22.980 --> 02:24.710
Kyle, why are you in the kitchen?

02:24.750 --> 02:26.950
I'm drawing a picture.

02:33.710 --> 02:35.550
Should we wake him up?

02:35.580 --> 02:38.580
No, let's just put him back to bed.

02:38.610 --> 02:40.150
I'm not finished yet.

02:40.180 --> 02:44.780
I ran out of wavelengths
640 to 750 nanometers.

02:44.810 --> 02:49.650
Frequency 480 to 405 theraherz.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.880
Hex triplet number FF0000

02:53.910 --> 02:55.280
What's he saying?

02:55.310 --> 02:58.050
He's basically saying he
needs more red.

02:59.610 --> 03:02.210
Come on, Kyle.

03:21.650 --> 03:24.180
You need to put them in order.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.280
You can do that in the morning.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.480
Okay.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.410
Good night.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.050
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 20:
Primary Colors</font>

03:48.410 --> 03:51.510
I guess I really was sleepwalking.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.650
Why would I have done that?

03:53.680 --> 03:56.380
Maybe you reached a boiling point.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.880
Sleepwalking is sometimes
a symptom of stress.

03:58.910 --> 04:00.510
I don't feel stressed.

04:00.550 --> 04:03.280
Well, that doesn't mean you're
not experiencing it.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.280
You're restricted from seeing Amanda,

04:05.310 --> 04:08.410
Adam Baylin has basically come
back from the dead,

04:08.450 --> 04:09.410
and Jessi--

04:09.450 --> 04:10.980
Is still being Jessi.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.180
That's three major relationships
in your life

04:13.210 --> 04:16.579
that are asking you to give an
unusual amount of emotional energy.

04:16.610 --> 04:19.680
You think that's why I'm sleepwalking?

04:19.709 --> 04:21.279
I think it's...

04:21.310 --> 04:25.180
kind of a drastic reaction
to the pressure, but...

04:25.210 --> 04:28.680
Yes, I think you may need to
simplify your life a little.

04:28.710 --> 04:30.710
Simplify.

04:31.850 --> 04:32.880
Back it up!

04:32.910 --> 04:35.350
I won the coin toss.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.350
Coin toss?

04:36.380 --> 04:38.080
Yeah, for your brain.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.210
Form a line, people.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.010
Okay, here's the deal.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.010
Placement exams--

04:48.050 --> 04:49.880
They're mostly crap.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.750
But they're mandatory,
so it must be important to do well.

04:52.780 --> 04:54.910
Screw up,
and you're looking at summer school.

04:54.950 --> 04:56.210
Really screw up,
and you have to repeat a grade.

04:56.250 --> 04:57.710
How can I help?

04:57.750 --> 05:01.050
Mr. Callahan is, like, smoking
hot for a 35-year-old math teacher.

05:01.080 --> 05:04.110
As a result,
I'm in desperate need for a trig recap.

05:04.150 --> 05:05.750
A recap?

05:05.780 --> 05:07.880
I haven't exactly paid
attention the last semester.

05:07.910 --> 05:10.650
- In every subject?
- Not in every subject.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.680
I'm just hung up on a couple of things in biology.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.580
What, does everyone need to study today?

05:14.610 --> 05:16.310
Oh, no, I've already studied.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.450
But I'm entering the prom theme song contest.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.150
Losing is not an option.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.680
I'm going to need to tap into
your mental thesaurus.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.810
Whatever you need.

05:23.850 --> 05:26.050
So, I managed to convince my mom
that it wouldn't hurt

05:26.080 --> 05:28.650
to have you tutor me for placement exams.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.810
That's great.

05:29.850 --> 05:32.350
I'd be happy to help you study.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.250
Oh, I don't want to study.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.510
I just want an acceptable excuse
to spend time with you today.

05:36.550 --> 05:37.810
Today.

05:37.850 --> 05:40.350
A whole afternoon of unchaperoned
quality time.

05:44.850 --> 05:46.380
You're not free.
I should have asked you first.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.310
No, it's fine.

05:48.350 --> 05:51.180
I'd love to spend unchaperoned
quality time with you.

05:51.210 --> 05:52.780
Good.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.550
And I'm think I'm sensing a thaw
where my mom's concerned.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.150
If she's letting us study together,
a date can't be too far behind.

05:59.380 --> 06:00.710
So I should ask her if we can go out?

06:00.750 --> 06:02.150
No.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.080
You should ask her to think about
considering the idea

06:04.110 --> 06:05.580
Whether or not we can go out.

06:05.610 --> 06:07.780
She's a glacier, not an ice cube.

06:07.810 --> 06:11.110
So if I told her that letting us
study is symbolic of her trust in me,

06:11.150 --> 06:13.580
and that I'd like to continue to
build that trust,

06:13.610 --> 06:17.150
maybe in time I can earn the honor
of having a date with you.

06:17.180 --> 06:20.050
Yeah, something exactly like that.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.580
See you later.

06:26.980 --> 06:29.210
Nicole advised me to simplify my life

06:29.250 --> 06:31.780
to avoid distractions and commitments,

06:31.810 --> 06:33.750
but the people I cared about needed me,

06:33.780 --> 06:36.450
and I didn't want to disappoint them.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.980
Kyle! Stephen, is something wrong?

06:40.010 --> 06:41.650
Yeah, the broth for my bouillabaisse.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.310
Impressive, Nicole will love it.

06:43.350 --> 06:45.480
Not if she can cut it with a knife.

06:45.510 --> 06:48.510
It should be vaguely in the realm of soup.

06:48.550 --> 06:50.280
Could you make something simpler?

06:50.310 --> 06:52.210
It's her anniversary. I want to wow her.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.750
I've never cooked before.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.410
I have a cookbook right here.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.510
It's all the basics in less than 2,000 pages.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.710
You can swing that, right?

07:00.750 --> 07:03.210
I'll see what I can do.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.350
Kill me now.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.850
My headstone can say,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.380
"Here lies Lori Trager,
singer/songwriter,

07:07.410 --> 07:09.110
choked on her own lyrics."

07:09.150 --> 07:11.310
It's a contest for a prom theme song.

07:11.350 --> 07:13.380
Tap into your inner girl.

07:13.410 --> 07:15.010
What does make the rest of me?

07:15.050 --> 07:16.210
You know what I mean.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.880
Don't let it frustrate you.

07:17.910 --> 07:18.880
I can't help it.

07:18.910 --> 07:20.250
Study guide.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.850
I cross-referenced placement
test guidelines

07:21.880 --> 07:23.280
with your english class syllabus.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.050
Factoring in mid-terms and quizzes

07:25.080 --> 07:26.480
I pinpointed the areas where
you should focus

07:26.510 --> 07:28.110
to maximize your study time.

07:28.150 --> 07:29.150
Thanks.

07:29.180 --> 07:30.150
W-w-w-wait!

07:30.180 --> 07:31.180
My turn.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.110
What rhymes with corsage?

07:33.150 --> 07:35.880
There are 12 interims for
the word "corsage."

07:35.910 --> 07:37.150
Garage, massage,

07:37.180 --> 07:38.910
barrage, mirage...

07:44.510 --> 07:46.480
Wait, there's also...

07:48.050 --> 07:49.850
Four words is a start.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.610
How's your study guide?

07:59.650 --> 08:00.750
Nice.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.680
Bio with a focus on human analogy.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.650
Anatomy.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.810
That's what I said.

08:09.550 --> 08:10.550
Do you hear that?

08:11.910 --> 08:14.510
What is it?

08:14.550 --> 08:15.550
Someone's humming.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.610
It's Jessi.

08:25.110 --> 08:28.580
Why can I hear her?

08:28.610 --> 08:31.280
A little something called super hearing?

08:31.310 --> 08:33.210
I can only do that when I'm trying.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.450
Your point?

08:34.480 --> 08:37.309
I'm not trying.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.280
Alrighty, then.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.950
Thanks for this.

08:40.980 --> 08:42.750
We'll get the study group going out to the house later.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.080
Is four o'clock cool?

08:44.110 --> 08:45.310
Sure.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.010
- Wait. Today?
- Hi.

08:53.210 --> 08:54.710
You were just humming that song.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.950
How did you make it sound so loud?

08:56.980 --> 08:59.680
I didn't. I was just humming.

08:59.710 --> 09:03.010
You must've used the acoustics
in here to direct your voice.

09:03.050 --> 09:05.280
Have-- have you been sleeping?

09:05.310 --> 09:08.350
You seem kind of worn down.

09:08.380 --> 09:10.480
I do?

09:10.510 --> 09:11.810
There's something wrong with you.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.410
I can feel it.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.580
I just need you to play my song

09:18.610 --> 09:20.280
So I can give it a pure listen
and make sure it's going

09:20.310 --> 09:21.280
To mesh with my lyrics.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.410
Five minutes and
then you can go stop dad

09:22.450 --> 09:23.910
from burning down our house.

09:29.150 --> 09:30.850
Um, that's not my song.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.410
I played what you wrote.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.180
Play it again.

09:37.910 --> 09:41.180
B flat,

09:41.210 --> 09:45.480
G minor,

09:45.510 --> 09:47.350
I don't even know how to play that chord.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.780
E flat major seven.

09:55.350 --> 09:57.880
F major.

09:57.910 --> 10:00.750
That's not your song.

10:00.780 --> 10:03.450
I'm sorry, I've had this other
song stuck in my head all day.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.110
Whatever it is, it's pretty.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.580
Thanks for bailing me out.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.310
I really want this dinner
to be something special.

10:14.350 --> 10:17.150
When you're doing something for
someone you really care about...

10:17.180 --> 10:20.780
Jessi was right,
there was something wrong with me.

10:20.810 --> 10:25.480
My mind seemed to be playing tricks.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.610
No matter how hard I focused,

10:27.650 --> 10:30.150
I was losing control of my abilities.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.110
And I didn't know why.

10:34.150 --> 10:35.980
Well, thanks, Kyle.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.750
You know, you're a natural in the kitchen.

10:39.510 --> 10:41.850
Mom, huge problem.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.280
Okay, Josh, could you give me,
like, five minutes?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.050
Kyle draws weird stuff all the time.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.180
- This is an emergency.
- What's wrong?

10:48.210 --> 10:49.950
How about every answer on the study sheet?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.950
Josh, this is basic high school science.

10:53.980 --> 10:56.110
Come on, you've been doing so well.

10:56.150 --> 10:57.510
That's the thing.

10:57.550 --> 10:58.510
I didn't make that.

10:58.550 --> 10:59.510
Kyle did.

10:59.550 --> 11:00.580
When did this happen?

11:00.610 --> 11:02.110
This morning.

11:02.150 --> 11:04.250
Plus, Lori and I both noticed
he was being clumsy

11:04.280 --> 11:05.810
And he kept having brain farts.

11:05.850 --> 11:07.310
He's on the fritz. You gotta fix him.

11:07.350 --> 11:08.750
I'm glad you're concerned.

11:08.780 --> 11:09.680
Concerned?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.310
I'm flipping out.

11:11.350 --> 11:13.350
I told everyone to come over
so kyle can help us study.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.950
What good is he going to be now?

11:14.980 --> 11:16.480
He's like the idiot king of stupid town.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.480
Kyle has a lot on his plate
right now, okay?

11:18.510 --> 11:21.510
Maybe you can try and study
without his help.

11:23.280 --> 11:26.910
Or I can find someone as smart
as Kyle to fill in.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.810
Yeah, good luck with that.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.950
And I expect you to come
straight home for dinner.

11:36.980 --> 11:39.080
Mrs. Bloom.

11:39.110 --> 11:41.150
Thank you for letting Amanda come over today.

11:42.450 --> 11:45.050
I'm still not sure it's such a good idea.

11:45.080 --> 11:45.761
However,

11:45.796 --> 11:51.550
I suppose the proof will come
when amanda's test results are posted.

11:51.580 --> 11:54.080
All right.

11:54.110 --> 11:56.750
I just wanna say that I
appreciate your trust in me,

11:56.780 --> 11:58.910
and I want to continue to build that trust.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.150
I hope you know that
I plan on working hard at

12:01.180 --> 12:02.910
earning the honor of a date
with your giraffe.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.550
I think he meant "date with me."

12:06.580 --> 12:09.580
I should certainly hope so.

12:09.610 --> 12:10.650
That's what I said.

12:12.410 --> 12:14.850
Just promise me you'll thank about it.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.210
All right, I'll think about it.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.580
Dinner, Amanda.

12:18.610 --> 12:20.080
I'll be on time.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.680
Did I say something wrong?

12:28.710 --> 12:31.380
It's not a big deal. You were nervous.

12:31.410 --> 12:34.650
Plus, I think my mom kind of
likes making you squirm.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.150
At least we get to spend
time together today.

12:37.180 --> 12:38.950
Speaking of time together--

12:38.980 --> 12:41.250
Josh's study group. I got the text.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.880
I'm sorry.

12:42.910 --> 12:45.050
Honestly, I could use a bit of study time.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.780
As long as I get to sit next to you.

12:46.810 --> 12:48.080
Kyle? Little help?

12:48.110 --> 12:50.010
That can be arranged.

12:50.050 --> 12:52.450
I just have to finish
something in the kitchen.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.450
I'll be waiting.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.180
How's the lobster sauce?

13:02.210 --> 13:04.350
I burned it before.
Now it's too runny.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.410
I'll give it a try.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.510
I heard lobster.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.550
You keep poking your head in here.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.050
Stephen, I get the whole top secret
thing, I really do.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.380
And I appreciate it, but...

13:14.410 --> 13:15.650
Will you quit snooping, then?

13:15.680 --> 13:16.750
Kyle and I have it under control.

13:16.780 --> 13:18.710
Are you sure about that?

13:22.210 --> 13:25.380
The recipe says you can thicken
the sauce by adding flour.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.410
This isn't flour, is it?

13:34.450 --> 13:39.080
Maybe you should lie down for a while.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.650
Go ahead. I can handle it from here.

13:46.710 --> 13:48.280
But Amanda, she...

13:48.310 --> 13:50.010
I'll just tell her you didn't
sleep well last night.

13:50.050 --> 13:51.780
I'm sure she'll understand.

13:53.350 --> 13:56.280
I'll be in my room if anyone needs me.

14:10.510 --> 14:12.410
Maybe I was too stressed,

14:12.450 --> 14:15.580
too busy trying to be
everything to everyone.

14:48.650 --> 14:49.880
Kyle?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.780
I drew the pictures again.

15:02.710 --> 15:05.050
Nicole?

15:08.210 --> 15:10.550
I only closed my eyes for a minute.

15:10.580 --> 15:12.850
You've been in here for almost an hour.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.010
I checked on you.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.280
You fell asleep at your desk.

15:21.350 --> 15:24.510
Whatever is wrong with me?
I don't think it's stress

15:37.000 --> 15:40.300
Thank god you're here.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.830
I'm already feeling at least
ten points above the 50th percentile.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.430
What is she doing here?

15:44.460 --> 15:47.230
Josh called and said you needed help studying.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.730
Kyle's letting you down.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.100
He's not letting us down, he's just--

15:50.130 --> 15:51.130
Not smart enough today?

15:51.160 --> 15:52.900
I know, but I am.

15:52.930 --> 15:54.260
You ready to get started?

15:58.800 --> 16:01.200
I'm sorry I left you out there.

16:01.230 --> 16:03.200
I think I accidentally fell asleep.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.800
I heard you were tired.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.260
Don't worry. The study session's underway.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.700
Josh brought in a ringer.

16:08.730 --> 16:09.800
A what?

16:09.830 --> 16:11.530
He called in Jessi to help.

16:12.860 --> 16:15.200
If you ask me,
she seems a little smug about it.

16:15.230 --> 16:18.000
She probably is.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.500
Is everything okay?

16:24.160 --> 16:25.160
Sure.

16:28.260 --> 16:29.200
I'm just...

16:29.230 --> 16:30.530
You're overloaded.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.530
We all put too much on you today.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.600
But I wanted to be there for everybody.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.500
How about if I'm here for you instead?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.500
That feels nice.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.830
You know...
Jessi probably could help you

16:52.860 --> 16:54.130
with your geometry theorems.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.160
Kyle.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.300
What?

16:57.330 --> 16:59.330
We're not gonna waste another minute

16:59.360 --> 17:01.930
of our quality time together
talking about Jessi.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.359
That's a good idea.

17:17.329 --> 17:18.700
18...

17:18.730 --> 17:19.859
19...

17:20.960 --> 17:22.099
20.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.859
What is it going to take for you to remember?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.360
There's no such thing as the vision system.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.330
The eyes are part of the...

17:32.360 --> 17:33.330
Nervous system?

17:33.360 --> 17:34.960
Get up.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.330
Now... Name the six muscles

17:40.360 --> 17:42.100
that control eye movement.

17:44.560 --> 17:46.700
Lateral rectus.

17:46.730 --> 17:48.500
The medieval rectus.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.430
It's the medial rectus.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.130
Lori. Wanna study with us?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.360
Not so much, no.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.600
Looks like somebody went to the
two-for-one man sale.

18:06.630 --> 18:08.460
Oh, look. It's my bar fight hero.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.200
Not you, sucker punch. You.

18:12.230 --> 18:14.500
Hey, how's the prom shapin' up?

18:14.530 --> 18:16.430
You found any bargain-basement DJs yet?

18:16.460 --> 18:18.530
Funny. I'm looking at one.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.700
You ought to get your eyes checked, then.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.100
I'm not the one with glasses, four-eyes.

18:23.130 --> 18:24.730
Cute.

18:24.760 --> 18:27.030
That insult was so high school.

18:28.930 --> 18:31.230
My dad's in the kitchen.

18:31.260 --> 18:32.460
You should go there.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.360
Now.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
All right.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.060
What?

18:44.100 --> 18:46.230
Hey, guys, this should be fun.

18:49.430 --> 18:52.500
I can't study on an empty stomach.

18:52.530 --> 18:54.160
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.960
I have a crappy high school song to write.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.800
I think Lori needs help
with her crappy song.

18:58.830 --> 18:59.930
I'll be right there!

19:00.930 --> 19:02.130
19...

19:02.160 --> 19:03.560
20.

19:04.900 --> 19:06.400
Stay.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.460
Thanks for taking care of this.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.830
I usually go to Kyle with
the mechanical problems

19:10.860 --> 19:14.200
I can't take care of myself,
but... he's unavailable, so...

19:14.230 --> 19:16.460
It's not a problem. Um,
I'll have 'em back to you tomorrow.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.930
Great.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.460
Uh, is there a bathroom I could
use before I head out?

19:20.500 --> 19:21.800
Upstairs and to the right.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.630
Ahem. Excuse me.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.630
Your ceviche looks perfect,
Mr. Trager.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.060
Is that fresh cilantro?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.200
Yes, it is.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.100
Yummy. What else have you made?

19:34.130 --> 19:35.860
Well, you name it,
and I've probably wrecked it

19:35.900 --> 19:37.560
Already once or twice today.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.030
Started out trying to make
a bouillabaisse,

19:39.060 --> 19:40.730
And Kyle helped me pare it
down from there.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.700
Wise choice! It took me
three of four tries

19:42.730 --> 19:45.600
Before I even got into the
french provençal cuisine ballpark.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.300
Uh, Hillary, what was it

19:48.330 --> 19:49.700
you were expecting to study today?

19:49.730 --> 19:51.230
Trig. I'd give you the lowdown

19:51.260 --> 19:54.000
on Mr. Callahan and his massive shoulders,

19:54.030 --> 19:55.960
but we're not really friends
like that yet, are we?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.130
Uh, no, not yet. But did you know

19:58.160 --> 20:00.960
that when I was an undergrad
I was a double major?

20:01.000 --> 20:03.100
And one of 'em was applied mathematics?

20:03.130 --> 20:04.260
For reals?

20:05.660 --> 20:07.360
Cause I'm sensing you need a salad course

20:07.400 --> 20:08.960
that'll stand up to your steaks

20:09.000 --> 20:10.760
without overpowering your lobster.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.000
How about a tomato, orange,
and saved fennel salad

20:13.030 --> 20:14.330
with frizzled leeks?

20:14.360 --> 20:15.860
You frizzle, and I'll tutor.

20:25.130 --> 20:27.960
See? I told you it would work out.
That was great.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Thanks, but that's not honest criticism.

20:30.030 --> 20:31.560
You're being a friend,

20:31.600 --> 20:33.530
and there are times when I need that from you

20:33.560 --> 20:36.160
or from my mother. This is not one of them.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.800
Did you just compare me to your--

20:37.830 --> 20:38.930
Sorta, kinda, yeah.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.630
Sorry.

20:40.660 --> 20:42.000
Hey. DJ boy.

20:42.030 --> 20:43.700
Did you hear any of that song?

20:44.930 --> 20:46.030
Uh, not really.

20:46.060 --> 20:47.330
Come in here.

20:47.360 --> 20:48.660
Whoa. What does his opinion matter?

20:48.700 --> 20:49.860
He knows music.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.230
I need a disinterested

20:51.260 --> 20:53.060
yet well-informed party to weigh in.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.560
Go ahead, Mark.
Be completely unfiltered.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.360
- No holds barred.
- Okay.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.530
Well, uh, the lyrics were catchy.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.930
None of this weak-ass, college boy,

21:02.960 --> 21:04.930
discussion group bull. Be real.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.500
All right.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.200
You need to work on musical composition.

21:09.230 --> 21:10.830
That's what I'm talking about.

21:10.860 --> 21:12.200
In-you-face gut reaction.

21:13.300 --> 21:15.230
I mean, your fingering is a mess.

21:15.260 --> 21:17.730
You handle a guitar like a--
a blunt instrument.

21:17.760 --> 21:21.160
- Real nice.
- No, no, it's okay.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.730
Come on. More.

21:22.760 --> 21:25.230
There are more than three chords to a pop song.

21:25.260 --> 21:27.400
You know?
Just because most people don't use 'em and--

21:29.030 --> 21:31.060
You should push yourself to be not so derivative.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.600
Right.

21:40.260 --> 21:42.060
Jessi, can I interrupt?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.000
Absolutely. We're not finished.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.500
I'll take over for you.

21:51.930 --> 21:53.030
Come on.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.060
Over here.

21:57.130 --> 21:58.860
I need you to try and read me.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.000
I read that answer sheet
you made for Josh.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.700
That's about all I need to know.

22:02.730 --> 22:04.630
When'd you get so ordinary?

22:04.660 --> 22:06.230
I'm serious, Jessi.

22:06.260 --> 22:08.700
You knew something was wrong
with me this morning.

22:08.730 --> 22:11.860
Maybe you can get in my head
and figure out what's happening.

22:11.900 --> 22:12.900
All right.

22:13.900 --> 22:14.900
I'll try.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.030
- You have to try, too.
- I am trying.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.530
It's like the signal's weak or something.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.860
What did you do?

22:31.900 --> 22:33.130
What do you mean?

22:33.160 --> 22:35.500
You did something. You pushed.

22:35.530 --> 22:36.560
That's not fair.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.060
I-- I didn't do anything.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.960
You made me promise not to push myself,

22:40.000 --> 22:41.630
and then you go out and do something new?

22:41.660 --> 22:42.860
Tell me what it is.

22:42.900 --> 22:44.700
This isn't a game, Jessi.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.360
I don't know what is happening to me.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.430
I could really be--

22:52.000 --> 22:53.600
You're the best. Did you know that?

22:53.630 --> 22:56.700
I guess I do now. What's this for?

22:56.730 --> 22:58.730
The other day,
when I was nervous about my tests

22:58.760 --> 23:00.160
To see if the cancer was gone--

23:00.200 --> 23:02.460
I don't really know you, but--

23:02.500 --> 23:04.030
Anyway, you were just there.
It's like...

23:04.060 --> 23:05.430
You knew I needed a hug.

23:05.460 --> 23:06.960
I don't really know you, either!

23:07.000 --> 23:09.530
Oh. It's okay. Hugs are good.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.960
What's all the lovin for?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.960
I was gonna text. Too impersonal.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.160
Then I was gonna call, but again, digital.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.160
This is a strictly analog moment
that should be shared

23:19.200 --> 23:21.100
with real-time hugs and gushy feelings.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.600
My test results are back.
I'm officially in remission!

23:50.330 --> 23:51.660
What did you do?

24:09.160 --> 24:11.630
You did it. You cured her.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.360
- That's impossible.
- Why?

24:13.400 --> 24:14.530
Because it is.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.960
I healed my hand. Adam Baylin

24:16.000 --> 24:17.200
healed himself when he was shot.

24:17.230 --> 24:18.330
It's not the same, Jessi.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.660
Andy's cancer was blood-related.

24:20.700 --> 24:22.960
Manipulating blood cells
to heal a cut...

24:23.000 --> 24:24.860
That's not that far off from
what you'd have to do.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.800
But I didn't try to do anything.

24:26.830 --> 24:28.960
I just wanted to make her feel better.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.960
An emotional trigger...

24:31.000 --> 24:33.900
Which is how we always
discover new abilities.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.530
- Yes, but it--
- Why are you always

24:35.560 --> 24:37.360
trying to deny what we're capable of?

24:37.400 --> 24:38.960
Can you just stop yelling?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.400
I'm not.

24:40.430 --> 24:42.730
It's pounding in my head.

24:44.330 --> 24:45.730
You're messed up.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.830
You did something that taxed your system.

24:47.860 --> 24:49.960
Now your system is punishing you.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.960
Look what happens if we're
not strong enough.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.630
Jessi, I can't do this right now.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.200
Everyone out there is relying on me.

24:56.230 --> 24:58.500
For study groups? Cooking?

24:58.530 --> 25:00.700
You and I are so much more than that.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.560
I don't want to be so much more!

25:03.800 --> 25:05.900
I want to help Josh ace his exams...

25:05.930 --> 25:07.630
Lori write her song,
and Stephen to prepare

25:07.660 --> 25:09.360
the perfect dinner for Nicole.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.630
I want to spend the
afternoon with Amanda.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.830
I want to be there for them...

25:14.860 --> 25:17.430
Be the person they need me to be.

25:17.460 --> 25:18.900
Mediocre.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.160
You wouldn't understand.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.330
You're right.

25:25.830 --> 25:27.660
I wouldn't.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.930
Jessi, I'm sorry. I didn't mean--

25:30.960 --> 25:33.000
We should, uh--
You should get back out there.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.200
I'm sure everyone's wondering where you are.

25:43.330 --> 25:46.230
I really have to go.
My moms are taking me out to celebrate.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.700
Pizza and batting cages.

25:47.730 --> 25:49.500
I should get back to studying.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.500
I'm glad I'm not with
cancer girl anymore.

25:54.530 --> 25:56.430
Well, I guess that means you need
a new t-shirt.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.330
I really have to go.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.560
Hils, I'm gonna take off.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.730
What about the study session?

26:04.760 --> 26:06.030
Not feelin' it.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.300
Where's Lori?

26:07.330 --> 26:08.930
Upstairs.
Mark gave her some feedback

26:08.960 --> 26:10.760
On her prom song. My T.A. Mark?

26:10.800 --> 26:13.300
Apparently, he's some
all-knowing musical big shot.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.300
You're kidding. Is he still here?

26:15.330 --> 26:16.630
No. He left.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.430
And... He's a little obnoxious,
if you ask me.

26:22.060 --> 26:24.100
Okay. All right,
uh, where were we?

26:24.130 --> 26:26.400
Um... Right. A cord

26:26.430 --> 26:28.530
Is just a straight line drawn
between two points

26:28.560 --> 26:29.660
on a curve.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.800
Okay, Mr. Trager.

26:31.830 --> 26:33.100
I think we're friends now.

26:33.130 --> 26:35.060
Can I be honest?

26:35.100 --> 26:37.330
Sure, but could Mr. Callahan wait?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.660
It's not about him. It's about Mark.

26:39.700 --> 26:42.630
I'm not so sure Lori should get
involved with an older man.

26:42.660 --> 26:45.760
An older-- w-what-- uh,
did I miss something?

26:45.800 --> 26:47.330
Apparently everything.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.930
Once upon a time,
Lori and Declan were leclan.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.160
They were joined at the hip.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.630
Then they weren't.

26:52.660 --> 26:54.800
Personally...
I think they're meant to be.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.700
Wait. So how does my T.A.
enter the picture?

26:58.730 --> 27:00.500
Oh, come on,
like you haven't noticed.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.230
No... I haven't.

27:02.260 --> 27:04.630
Well, snarky Mark is a hottie
in dork's clothing,

27:04.660 --> 27:06.730
but I don't think Lori is
seeing it just yet.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.530
She has no idea their aggro-flirting

27:09.560 --> 27:11.430
is thinly disguised sexual tension.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.100
Sexual-- what...

27:14.130 --> 27:16.260
Ex-- exactly are you talking about?

27:17.500 --> 27:19.030
Sexual nothing!

27:19.060 --> 27:21.630
What I meant was,
could you pass the sherry vinegar?

27:21.660 --> 27:24.430
Hey, dad. Good news made Josh hungry.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.460
Son, I'm happier for you than I've ever been,

27:26.500 --> 27:28.100
But if you touch my ceviche,
I will kill you.

27:28.130 --> 27:30.330
Is Kyle okay?
He disappeared into his room again.

27:30.360 --> 27:32.000
Hopefully, he's in there getting smarter.

27:32.030 --> 27:33.000
I'm fine.

27:33.030 --> 27:34.660
Good. He's all yours.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.800
It's been a pleasure, Mr. Trager.

27:36.830 --> 27:37.830
Bon appetite!

27:40.330 --> 27:41.830
No more study session?

27:41.860 --> 27:43.500
Let's just say I learned some things

27:43.530 --> 27:44.760
I'm not sure I wanted to know.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.300
Are you feeling better?

27:48.200 --> 27:49.600
I am now.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.530
Kyle, you all right?

27:58.560 --> 28:01.160
Yeah. What can I do to help?

28:01.200 --> 28:02.800
We're pretty good here.

28:02.830 --> 28:03.260
Hillary was surprisingly helpful.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.460
Uh...Josh, how's biology?

28:12.500 --> 28:15.430
The medial rectus.
Jessi made sure I'll never forget it.

28:17.300 --> 28:21.500
Not much, but there's no way
I'm failing that test.

28:21.530 --> 28:23.460
Okay, at least let me set the table.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.660
Okay.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.060
Do you need any help?

28:35.900 --> 28:37.000
Plates.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.700
Thanks for helping.

28:40.730 --> 28:42.600
- Kyle.
- What's happening?

28:46.300 --> 28:48.660
- Kyle!
- Oh, no!

28:48.700 --> 28:49.830
Just step back. Dad!

28:51.060 --> 28:52.230
Dad?

28:53.860 --> 28:54.830
It's gonna be OK.

29:02.700 --> 29:04.630
You're back so soon?

29:04.660 --> 29:06.400
Kyle's not feeling well.

29:06.430 --> 29:08.500
Well, if he felt he was
coming down with a bug,

29:08.530 --> 29:10.030
he shouldn't have offered to tutor.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.660
You could've caught some...

29:11.700 --> 29:13.000
thing.

29:23.730 --> 29:27.400
I remember that song.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.630
I haven't heard it in forever.
How do you know it?

29:29.660 --> 29:32.330
Kyle needed it to get through
something once.

29:33.260 --> 29:35.060
He loves it when I play.

29:37.830 --> 29:39.860
Maybe it'll help him now.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.330
Amanda's music was a comfort.

29:54.360 --> 29:58.300
But I still felt lost and confused.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.800
I knew Stephen and Nicole were worried...

30:00.830 --> 30:02.500
Not sure how to help me.

30:03.830 --> 30:05.030
All of us were hoping

30:05.060 --> 30:07.460
that answers were on the way.

30:16.300 --> 30:17.960
You ready? No.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.460
- Hello. I'm--
- Adam Baylin.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.860
It's so good to finally meet you.

30:27.900 --> 30:29.830
We've heard a lot about you.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.200
Come in. Thank you.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.560
- This is, uh, my husband--
- Stephen.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.130
And Nicole.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.300
Kyle speaks very fondly of you.

30:44.330 --> 30:47.060
Well, he's told us
a lot about you, too.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.130
Yeah.

30:49.160 --> 30:51.060
Not about the resemblance.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.500
Uh... it's pretty striking.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.060
I didn't try to heal Andy.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.930
I wouldn't.
You cautioned me against pushing myself.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.400
Well, using your mind

31:03.430 --> 31:05.430
to affect another person's physiology

31:05.460 --> 31:07.230
is conceivable... someday.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.100
But I don't think it's possible

31:10.130 --> 31:12.260
at this stage of your development.

31:12.300 --> 31:16.060
Yet... You're experiencing strange symptoms.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.600
Especially my hearing.

31:18.630 --> 31:20.800
Sounds are louder... distorted.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.630
There must be a link
between what you're hearing

31:30.660 --> 31:32.130
and what you've been drawing.

31:41.660 --> 31:42.960
Where did you get this?

31:44.830 --> 31:46.760
Uh, someone left it for Jessi.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.460
We don't know who.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.930
It was missing from the jukebox

31:49.960 --> 31:51.160
when we went to the diner.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.700
Well, have you listened to it?

31:53.900 --> 31:55.500
- Yes.
- How often?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.530
A lot lately.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.200
I like it. It relaxes me.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.400
Listen again.

32:15.630 --> 32:17.730
You don't hear anything else.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.930
Am I supposed to be hearing something?

32:25.060 --> 32:26.300
Listen carefully.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.200
How can you study when your
whole life just changed?

32:32.230 --> 32:34.560
Andy threatened me with my life
if I blew off placement exams

32:34.600 --> 32:36.360
Just because she's in remission.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.500
She's tough.

32:38.530 --> 32:41.600
Yeah, and without the chemo
to make her weak,

32:41.630 --> 32:43.600
she could actually kick my ass.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.600
I'm just trying to distract myself

32:45.630 --> 32:47.260
from figuring out what's
going on at home.

32:47.300 --> 32:48.760
You too, huh?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.130
Why'd they kick us out when
things were getting good?

32:51.160 --> 32:54.060
I wanted to get a look at the
mad scientist who brewed up Kyle.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.900
You say it like that,
it sounds kind of creepy.

32:56.930 --> 32:59.400
You know what I mean.

32:59.430 --> 33:00.930
The dude's smart.

33:00.960 --> 33:02.660
I just hope he can help Kyle figure out

33:02.700 --> 33:04.230
what's up with his power outage.

33:04.260 --> 33:05.560
And all the mental brown-outs.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.960
And all the clumsiness.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.960
All the drawings in primary colors.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.830
Lori?

33:10.860 --> 33:12.460
Hey.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.760
You left this sweater.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.300
Yeah, and I brought you this.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.260
What, did you take it upon
yourself to rewrite my song?

33:21.300 --> 33:21.517
Well,

33:21.552 --> 33:24.560
"rewriting" implies you had more
than four chords in it to begin with.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.930
I'm a three-chord wonder, remember?

33:26.960 --> 33:29.260
You're also a great lyricist.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.630
Like, rock-my-world poetic

33:32.660 --> 33:36.200
and funny and unexpected.

33:36.230 --> 33:38.230
- You like my lyrics?
- I do.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.660
I mean, every time I try to write
my own, I kind of just--

33:40.700 --> 33:43.730
Handle the english language
like a blunt instrument?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.860
Hmm.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.100
So, you want to help me with the music.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.560
And you're going to wow me with the lyrics.

33:53.600 --> 33:58.130
I'd be happy to do that in exchange for...

33:58.160 --> 34:01.100
I DJ the prom.

34:01.130 --> 34:03.160
You're killing me.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.800
Consider it a launching platform
for our hot new single.

34:10.730 --> 34:15.530
Lori Trager, high school girl.

34:17.900 --> 34:19.100
You have a deal.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.429
Adam thinks this record has something to do

34:36.460 --> 34:38.060
with what's wrong with me.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.400
What is it about this song?

34:39.429 --> 34:41.460
Well, it's not the song.

34:41.500 --> 34:45.030
It's the sounds buried beneath the music.

34:45.060 --> 34:46.000
Can you hear them?

34:46.030 --> 34:47.830
No, I still can't.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.030
I can't either.

34:50.060 --> 34:51.960
Well, you wouldn't be able to
perceive them, Nicole.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.429
They're subliminal.

34:53.460 --> 34:55.929
It's not a frequency you'd be able to hear,

34:55.960 --> 34:57.300
but Kyle should.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.860
This is why you're feeling peculiar,

35:01.900 --> 35:03.800
and why your hearing is exaggerated.

35:03.830 --> 35:07.600
Your subconscious is trying
to tell you to listen.

35:07.630 --> 35:09.630
Listen?

35:09.660 --> 35:11.200
That's what the instant message said.

35:17.630 --> 35:20.400
You need to clear your mind,

35:20.430 --> 35:21.960
block out any outside sound.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.830
Focus.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.760
I can hear it now.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.630
Sarah and I used to take this record

35:44.660 --> 35:46.160
and bury messages for each other

35:46.200 --> 35:47.660
within the music.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.030
It was our secret game.

35:50.060 --> 35:52.460
We'd translate the sounds into images.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.130
How?

35:54.160 --> 35:56.860
Just like a fax machine
transmits a series of tones

35:56.900 --> 35:58.860
to send a copy.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.000
I fell asleep listening to
the record last night,

36:01.030 --> 36:02.800
and then again this afternoon.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.730
And each time after listening,
you drew those pictures.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.530
They all seem so random.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.930
Well, yes,
if you look at them individually.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.300
But blended together...

36:10.330 --> 36:13.600
Adam, if someone is sending Kyle

36:13.630 --> 36:15.660
a message this way...

36:15.700 --> 36:17.760
I mean, you said it was your
secret game with Sarah,

36:17.800 --> 36:20.800
and I'm sorry,
but I thought Sarah was dead.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.100
She is.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.100
All the drawings have been
scanned and put in order.

36:39.140 --> 36:40.700
- We're ready.
- Okay,

36:40.740 --> 36:43.270
so let's hook it up so everyone can see.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.240
So, how does this work?

36:45.270 --> 36:47.900
Isn't it just going to be a bunch
of blobs in widescreen format?

36:47.940 --> 36:50.000
More like a flipbook.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.840
We'll use the computer to view
all 450 images in rapid succession.

36:52.870 --> 36:55.670
And our eyes will knit together
the individual drawings

36:55.700 --> 36:58.070
And the colors will blend.

36:58.100 --> 36:59.740
We'll see what it is I'm supposed to see.

37:08.370 --> 37:09.970
Try speeding it up.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
No problem.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Latnok.

37:38.640 --> 37:41.570
"I'm alive."

37:41.600 --> 37:45.640
I gave Sarah a Latnok ring
with a red stone.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.900
It was one of a kind.

37:49.940 --> 37:52.170
Then she must have sent this.

37:53.970 --> 37:55.900
It's impossible.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.670
She can't be.

38:09.440 --> 38:11.700
Hey.

38:11.740 --> 38:14.370
Bet you're looking forward to
a good night's sleep.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.200
I am.

38:17.970 --> 38:21.700
Oh, before I forget,
happy anniversary.

38:23.970 --> 38:25.770
I'm sorry I got in the
way of your dinner.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.640
No worries, Kyle.

38:28.670 --> 38:31.440
This was definitely a memorable one.

38:31.470 --> 38:33.640
It was? Well, sure.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.640
We had a house full of teenagers,

38:35.670 --> 38:39.240
a sick kid, a cancer remission,
a secret message,

38:39.270 --> 38:41.540
and a visit from a self-healing genius

38:41.570 --> 38:43.000
back from months in a coma.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.400
How was it for you?

38:47.440 --> 38:50.640
Meeting Adam.

38:50.670 --> 38:53.870
Well, I know I said he was
welcome here anytime,

38:53.900 --> 38:57.700
but I did actually have
some anxiety about it.

38:57.740 --> 39:00.040
He's not used to being
around other people,

39:00.070 --> 39:01.500
and the message bringing up

39:01.540 --> 39:02.940
all those feelings about Sarah--

39:02.970 --> 39:05.170
Kyle, you don't have to
make excuses for him.

39:08.470 --> 39:11.500
It's just that you're both such
an important part of my life.

39:12.870 --> 39:15.840
We'll find a way to coexist.

39:15.870 --> 39:18.500
Don't start worrying about how
Adam will get along with the family.

39:18.540 --> 39:19.970
You'll stress yourself out.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.740
So what was it that made you anxious?

39:27.900 --> 39:31.070
Adam left us in charge
with preparing you

39:31.100 --> 39:34.040
for some greater purpose,

39:34.070 --> 39:38.000
and all I could show him
today was a sick boy.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.940
You were right about calling him.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.970
Doesn't every good doctor
call in a specialist?

39:45.200 --> 39:47.570
I'm glad that I did.

39:47.600 --> 39:50.370
But I don't think I'm supposed to know

39:50.400 --> 39:53.870
how to handle every situation.

39:53.900 --> 39:59.370
You're too special for me to
be able to handle all that.

40:00.540 --> 40:03.040
Nicole...

40:03.070 --> 40:06.300
I think you're special enough
to handle it all.

40:12.740 --> 40:15.000
Ugh.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.700
Hasn't everybody we know
already been here today?

40:18.740 --> 40:20.470
Amanda says you were coming
down with something.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.840
You look fine to me.

40:21.870 --> 40:24.540
I was just tired, that's all.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.500
Did I do something wrong?

40:30.770 --> 40:33.600
Something happened while
Amanda was over here.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.170
Really, nothing did.

40:38.300 --> 40:41.900
She came home and played the piano.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.670
My daughter hasn't struck a note

40:43.700 --> 40:45.600
since she came back from the conservatory.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.540
Not one single note until today.

40:48.570 --> 40:51.370
She did it because she knows
you love her playing.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.670
You have no idea how much I've missed it.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.640
I've missed it, too.

41:01.670 --> 41:05.440
Well, whatever you did,
thank you, Kyle.

41:05.470 --> 41:08.600
I'll have to make an effort to
be less wary of you,

41:08.640 --> 41:12.500
Even if you did come from
a juvenile detention center.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.570
Mrs. Bloom.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.200
Yes?

41:16.570 --> 41:19.940
I know it's a lot to ask, but...

41:19.970 --> 41:22.000
Could I take Amanda to the prom?

41:24.700 --> 41:26.000
We'll see.

41:26.040 --> 41:29.140
And by that,
I mean I will think about it.

41:29.170 --> 41:30.170
Maybe.

41:32.600 --> 41:34.000
Yes.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.600
And don't you ever strong-arm me

41:35.640 --> 41:37.900
like that again, young man.

41:53.170 --> 41:54.740
Fortunately, this food survived

41:54.770 --> 41:56.070
your little pyrotechnic display.

41:56.100 --> 41:57.570
I have no clue what it is,

41:57.600 --> 41:59.300
but I think someone needs to sample it.

41:59.340 --> 42:01.540
Uh, Stephen made that special for Nicole.

42:01.570 --> 42:03.040
And?

42:03.070 --> 42:05.100
And maybe you should wait till leftovers?

42:07.900 --> 42:10.970
So, all your mental wires
are in place again?

42:11.000 --> 42:13.500
- I think so.
- Good.

42:13.540 --> 42:15.700
I had enough of Kyle unplugged.

42:15.740 --> 42:18.300
I mean, I was getting kind
of worried about you.

42:18.340 --> 42:20.640
Well, I'm fine now,
so nothing to worry about.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.000
That's great news about Andy.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.670
Yeah! Amazing!

42:31.170 --> 42:33.240
She told me she felt better
after you hugged her.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.970
Everyone feels better after a hug.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.870
But then your system went
all out of whack.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.470
It was just a reaction
to the message in the song.

42:47.370 --> 42:49.770
You can say what you want,

42:49.800 --> 42:52.040
but I'd like to think that you helped her.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.870
I spent the day unable to be there

42:55.900 --> 42:58.140
For the people I cared about the most,

42:58.170 --> 43:00.070
yet everyone worked to help each other

43:00.100 --> 43:03.140
when I couldn't help them or myself.

43:03.170 --> 43:06.240
The problem was never
that I'd taken on too much

43:06.270 --> 43:08.870
or caused myself stress.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.640
It was only that I didn't see

43:10.670 --> 43:12.700
the simplest way to solve a problem

43:12.740 --> 43:15.470
is to be sure you have someone to help you.

43:18.270 --> 43:19.500
Pretty good.

43:19.540 --> 43:21.040
Oh, yeah.
