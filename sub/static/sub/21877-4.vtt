WEBVTT

00:04.067 --> 00:07.600
Did someone walk in front
of the motion detector?

00:07.635 --> 00:08.798
That's not me.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.767
I do not
see anybody.

00:15.533 --> 00:19.033
Whatever it is always
touches me on my right arm.

00:19.068 --> 00:21.300
I saw a man standing
in that back corner.

00:21.335 --> 00:23.765
He kind of just
wants me to go away.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.400
It sounds like someone
running against the door.

00:31.033 --> 00:32.867
'This whole bed
is shaking.

00:38.433 --> 00:40.532
I'm Amy Bruni.

00:40.567 --> 00:43.200
I was only 8
when a paranormal incident

00:43.235 --> 00:44.800
changed my life forever.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.265
Since then,
I've dedicated my time

00:48.300 --> 00:52.100
to solving the most terrifying
hauntings imaginable.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.532
I'm Adam Berry.

00:53.567 --> 00:56.133
More than a decade ago,
an encounter at gettysburg

00:56.168 --> 00:58.467
rocked my beliefs
about the supernatural.

00:58.502 --> 01:00.633
Together,
we uncover the truth

01:00.668 --> 01:02.267
behind
the unexplainable.

01:02.302 --> 01:03.698
Oh.
Oh, my god.

01:03.733 --> 01:07.100
Now we are on
our most important mission yet.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.798
Helping families
overcome their fear,

01:10.833 --> 01:15.267
take back their homes,
and reclaim their lives.

01:15.302 --> 01:18.267
synced by dom.smrc

01:23.667 --> 01:27.633
So, um, I have to
tell you about Carl and Cindy.

01:27.668 --> 01:28.698
Okay.

01:28.733 --> 01:30.333
So, they bought the house
five years ago,

01:30.368 --> 01:31.933
and the activity
is absolutely crazy.

01:31.968 --> 01:32.932
Really?
Yeah.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.167
Listen to this.
This is his voicemail.

01:34.202 --> 01:36.467
You can hear it
in his voice.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:02.767 --> 02:04.367
This just happened...
The stove thing.

02:04.402 --> 02:06.298
That's extremely dangerous,

02:06.333 --> 02:08.332
but the freakiest thing
that he told me

02:08.366 --> 02:11.567
was that he was working on
chairs that he had just bought.

02:11.602 --> 02:12.665
Right.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.733
And they were on the table
butt-side down,

02:14.768 --> 02:17.650
with the legs up,
and next to him,

02:17.685 --> 02:21.026
this chair lifts us
a little bit,

02:21.061 --> 02:23.914
floats out,
flips up like this,

02:23.949 --> 02:26.732
and then sits
right back down.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.200
And that is honestly
the craziest claim

02:29.235 --> 02:30.432
that I've ever heard

02:30.467 --> 02:32.983
in terms of an object moving
in front of someone

02:33.018 --> 02:35.500
who is having paranormal
activity in their house.

02:35.535 --> 02:37.032
Well, it sounds like
whatever's there

02:37.067 --> 02:40.400
is frantically trying
to make contact with them

02:40.435 --> 02:41.933
or let them know
that it's there.

02:41.968 --> 02:42.898
Right.

02:42.933 --> 02:43.898
He's worried,
you know...

02:43.933 --> 02:45.132
He's worried
that it's gonna pick up.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.367
He's worried that
the activity's gonna keep going.

02:47.402 --> 02:48.833
I can see why
that would be alarming.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.433
Yeah.
So we have to help them.

02:51.468 --> 02:53.733
Yeah.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.583
It sounds like Carl and Cindy

03:02.618 --> 03:04.565
deal with activity every day.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.967
But now, whatever's causing the
disturbance is getting worse.

03:08.002 --> 03:10.634
The activity is actually
frightening them.

03:10.669 --> 03:13.101
The scary part...
There's no way to know

03:13.136 --> 03:15.498
if the intention
is positive or negative.

03:15.533 --> 03:19.400
But the stovetop turning on
and off could be dangerous.

03:19.435 --> 03:21.200
And they don't want
the activity to pick up,

03:21.235 --> 03:23.167
so there's a lot at stake here.

03:23.202 --> 03:25.065
Let's start
from the beginning,

03:25.100 --> 03:28.165
and you just tell us
exactly what's going on.

03:28.200 --> 03:31.600
After we bought the house...
We bought the house about 2012,

03:31.635 --> 03:34.117
and there was somebody
who had been living here

03:34.152 --> 03:36.600
and was really a mess,
from what I understand.

03:36.635 --> 03:37.565
Mm-hmm.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.632
And I tore
everything out.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.567
Is that about when
the activity started?

03:41.602 --> 03:42.665
Yep.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.900
But I don't think
it's sure of me.

03:44.935 --> 03:45.865
Okay.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.732
I think
it likes Carl better.

03:47.767 --> 03:50.265
Okay, and what
makes you say that?

03:50.300 --> 03:53.100
It's more around him
than it is for me.

03:53.135 --> 03:54.232
Mm-hmm. Okay.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.900
Anything specifically
happening in this space?

03:56.935 --> 03:58.098
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

03:58.133 --> 04:03.433
I was lying on the couch,
and all of a sudden,

04:03.468 --> 04:05.633
somebody said,
"Carl, hi.

04:05.668 --> 04:06.950
I'm here."

04:06.985 --> 04:08.198
The voice...

04:08.233 --> 04:09.833
It sounded like
it was familiar with you?

04:09.868 --> 04:11.165
Or...

04:11.200 --> 04:13.716
I mean, it seems like
it was comfortable, or...

04:13.751 --> 04:16.233
It sounded like
it was comfortable being here.

04:16.267 --> 04:17.832
Okay.

04:17.867 --> 04:20.399
And every once in a while,
I'll hear, like, music.

04:20.435 --> 04:21.933
You hear the music
regularly, or...

04:21.968 --> 04:22.932
Yes.

04:22.967 --> 04:25.332
Does it sound like
it has a filter

04:25.367 --> 04:28.400
in between you and itself,
or is it clear?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.598
It's not clear.
Okay.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.067
But you definitely
know it's music.

04:33.102 --> 04:34.198
Okay.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.365
And it's been amping up.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.500
We've had knocking,
we've had...

04:38.535 --> 04:40.301
Footsteps.

04:40.336 --> 04:42.032
Touching.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.967
Where in the house
does the touching happen?

04:44.002 --> 04:46.367
Upstairs.
Okay.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.116
The touching happens
up here.

04:57.151 --> 04:59.692
The knocking
happens up here.

04:59.727 --> 05:02.763
The sounds...
The booms...

05:02.798 --> 05:05.932
They're always at a...
Strong.

05:05.967 --> 05:09.067
What does it
sound like, exactly?

05:09.102 --> 05:10.565
It sounds like, say,

05:10.600 --> 05:13.200
someone running
against the door.

05:13.235 --> 05:14.898
Mm-hmm.
Like the thud.

05:14.933 --> 05:17.667
And then the knocking
is different.

05:17.702 --> 05:18.833
It's just
definite knocks?

05:18.868 --> 05:20.417
It's definite knocks.

05:20.452 --> 05:22.009
Where in this...
Where?

05:22.044 --> 05:23.532
It's come out
of this room.

05:23.567 --> 05:26.167
This is our dressing room.
Out of the closet.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.367
In the closet,
the knocks?

05:27.402 --> 05:28.534
Yes.
Yeah.

05:28.569 --> 05:29.667
Okay. Like...

05:31.400 --> 05:35.332
Right, yeah.

05:35.367 --> 05:38.233
And it was on
the actual door here?

05:38.268 --> 05:40.598
That one time?

05:40.633 --> 05:42.400
No, about three times
that has happened.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.032
Like that?

05:47.067 --> 05:49.200
Yes,
just like that.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.400
This was the workshop,
and it was probably

06:01.435 --> 06:04.167
like right about here
where that chair was.

06:04.202 --> 06:06.201
And I was standing
about here,

06:06.236 --> 06:08.200
and that's when
it just slid out

06:08.235 --> 06:10.032
and turned right-side-up

06:10.067 --> 06:12.532
and then came down
to the floor.

06:12.567 --> 06:16.100
And it didn't even slam...
Which I can't understand.

06:16.135 --> 06:18.400
So, someone, like,
set it down almost?

06:18.435 --> 06:19.565
Like they
set it down, right.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.233
Almost as if
they were pulling out a chair

06:21.268 --> 06:22.667
at a dining-room table
and sitting down...

06:22.702 --> 06:24.067
They're gonna talk to me
or something.

06:24.102 --> 06:25.598
Okay.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.300
So, this was what time
of the day?

06:28.335 --> 06:29.698
It was at night.

06:29.733 --> 06:32.367
And how soon after
you moved in did that happen?

06:32.402 --> 06:33.733
It wasn't that long.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.334
Yep.

06:36.369 --> 06:38.865
Hmm.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.567
Any idea who
you might think it is?

06:40.602 --> 06:42.632
Mm-hmm.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.232
I really don't know.

06:44.267 --> 06:48.300
I know
when my grandmother had died,

06:48.335 --> 06:50.032
we were
very, very close.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.267
What was your grandmother's
name, really quick?

06:52.302 --> 06:53.600
My grandmother's name
was Helen.

06:53.635 --> 06:56.332
Okay.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.633
Something doesn't feel
quite right.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.198
We know from past cases

07:00.233 --> 07:03.167
that it's not always
the most likely suspect,

07:03.202 --> 07:05.232
and if it was
a loving family member,

07:05.267 --> 07:08.267
why would Carl and Cindy
feel so threatened by it?

07:08.302 --> 07:09.565
I need to sit down with Cindy

07:09.600 --> 07:11.967
and see if there is
something else at play here.

07:12.002 --> 07:15.067
How does it feel
to have this thing

07:15.102 --> 07:17.032
that's here with you?

07:17.067 --> 07:19.067
Intimidating.
It's like an invasion.

07:19.102 --> 07:20.032
Right.

07:20.067 --> 07:22.983
Very, like,
very much so.

07:23.018 --> 07:25.865
Has there ever
been anything

07:25.900 --> 07:28.883
that you felt
especially afraid of?

07:28.918 --> 07:31.209
Upstairs,
I definitely feel like

07:31.244 --> 07:33.500
someone's standing
next to me,

07:33.535 --> 07:35.865
watching me.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.200
And whatever it is always
touches me on my right arm.

07:39.235 --> 07:40.432
Mm-hmm.

07:40.467 --> 07:43.800
When all the activity
really started ramping up,

07:43.835 --> 07:47.067
I got more worried
about walking upstairs

07:47.102 --> 07:49.298
or walking downstairs.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.216
How much further
was it gonna go?

07:51.251 --> 07:53.100
That's what really
made me afraid.

07:53.135 --> 07:54.098
Right.

07:54.133 --> 07:55.500
Your own personal safety
at that point.

07:55.535 --> 07:58.032
Yeah, for me.
Yes.

07:58.067 --> 08:00.867
Is there anybody
that you can think of

08:00.902 --> 08:02.665
that maybe
you have lost

08:02.700 --> 08:06.032
or been connected to
over the years?

08:06.067 --> 08:08.833
The only one I can think of
is my grandmother.

08:08.868 --> 08:10.632
When she passed away,

08:10.667 --> 08:13.432
nobody knew
that she was ill,

08:13.467 --> 08:17.067
and none of us kids
got to go to see her.

08:17.102 --> 08:18.133
Her name was Mary.

08:18.168 --> 08:19.798
All right.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.033
Do you think
it's something

08:22.068 --> 08:24.198
or someone
that knew Carl

08:24.233 --> 08:26.566
or do you think
it came with the house?

08:26.601 --> 08:28.900
If I had to guess
if it was one person,

08:28.935 --> 08:30.698
it would be
his grandmother.

08:30.733 --> 08:34.400
Does it ever
make you worry for him?

08:34.434 --> 08:37.100
I do,
but I can't say anything.

08:37.135 --> 08:38.298
Yeah.

08:38.332 --> 08:41.366
Because I don't want him
to know how much I worry.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.567
Cindy's watched
over the last five years

08:59.602 --> 09:01.698
as this activity has escalated.

09:01.733 --> 09:04.767
The next logical step is that
this thing gets physical.

09:04.802 --> 09:05.865
She said she's afraid

09:05.900 --> 09:07.400
something's gonna
push them down the stairs,

09:07.435 --> 09:09.700
and that's kind of
her worst nightmare.

09:09.735 --> 09:11.867
Do you want
to start upstairs?

09:11.902 --> 09:13.434
Yeah,
let's do that.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.932
In the bedroom?
Or...

09:14.967 --> 09:16.500
I think
that's the most logical place.

09:16.535 --> 09:18.765
That's where
Cindy feels like

09:18.800 --> 09:21.732
she gets touched
the most... up there.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.333
Do you think that freaks her out
more than she's letting on?

09:23.368 --> 09:25.332
She says she worries

09:25.367 --> 09:27.565
that because it's escalated
over the years,

09:27.600 --> 09:29.933
like since they got here,
she's afraid the next step

09:29.968 --> 09:31.700
will be at, like,
actually harming them.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.865
Whatever's here
seems very physical.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.616
We hope it will use
that energy to reach out.

09:46.651 --> 09:49.298
Since we don't know
how it will communicate,

09:49.333 --> 09:52.883
we'll use a recorder to capture
any electronic voice phenomena

09:52.918 --> 09:56.433
and a k ii meter to detect
electromagnetic fields generated

09:56.468 --> 09:58.865
when a spirit could be present.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.933
Okay, I would like
to start doing EVP work.

10:03.968 --> 10:05.998
Hey, uh, Adam?
Yes?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.833
The K-II meter
is going off.

10:12.933 --> 10:16.665
Hello,
is someone in here?

10:16.700 --> 10:19.367
Can you make this
go all the way up to red?

10:25.533 --> 10:27.867
You can let it go.

10:27.902 --> 10:29.533
Make it stop.

10:31.967 --> 10:33.565
I'm sorry.
It just stopped.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.367
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.998
It it's
a "yes" answer,

10:37.033 --> 10:39.433
I want you
to light it up, okay?

10:39.468 --> 10:41.467
Are you still here
with us?

10:46.033 --> 10:48.165
Hear that?
No.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.367
Did you hear that?
What did you just hear?

10:51.402 --> 10:53.933
I don't know.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.233
Are you still here
with us?

11:19.300 --> 11:21.098
Hear that?
No.

11:21.133 --> 11:22.933
Did you hear that?
What did you just hear?

11:24.633 --> 11:26.098
I don't know.

11:26.133 --> 11:29.067
It sounded like it was
coming from, like, over there.

11:29.102 --> 11:30.767
Why don't you
sit in there?

11:30.802 --> 11:33.233
Bye.

11:38.133 --> 11:41.067
I'm hearing movement
in this room.

11:41.102 --> 11:43.333
In what room?
Here.

11:45.933 --> 11:48.233
I need to, like,
open this door.

11:54.800 --> 11:59.065
Tapped on is that one.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.533
This is...
Okay, let me listen.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.833
Okay, no, Adam.

12:09.868 --> 12:13.333
Seriously.

12:13.368 --> 12:14.732
No.

12:14.767 --> 12:17.898
I just heard tapping
on this door.

12:17.933 --> 12:21.067
No, there's, like,
something rummaging, like,

12:21.102 --> 12:24.032
keh, keh, keh,
like, on the door.

12:24.067 --> 12:27.200
I'm gonna bring the K-II
in here just to...

12:36.133 --> 12:37.733
I'm gonna
run this, too.

12:40.767 --> 12:42.232
All right.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.165
Whoever's here...

12:44.200 --> 12:47.933
Can you
knock on that door again?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.100
Maybe up towards
this area?

12:52.167 --> 12:54.600
Do you know Helen?

12:59.733 --> 13:01.065
What about Mary?

13:01.100 --> 13:03.233
Is there someone here
named Mary?

13:21.667 --> 13:23.400
Wait, go back.
Whoa.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.117
What was that?

13:25.152 --> 13:26.800
I'm sorry, what?

13:32.500 --> 13:36.098
Mary is here!

13:36.133 --> 13:38.300
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

13:47.567 --> 13:49.665
Mary is here.

13:49.700 --> 13:50.898
Who is Mary again?

13:50.933 --> 13:53.200
Mary was
<i>Cindy's</i> grandmother.

13:53.235 --> 13:55.233
Let me... up here.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.198
Yeah.

13:56.233 --> 13:58.300
Let's put it
right here.

14:01.867 --> 14:05.517
If you're here with us,
can you just let us know

14:05.552 --> 14:09.167
by grabbing that
green light there, you see?

14:09.202 --> 14:12.067
If you grab it,
hold on to it.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.734
It will go from...
There we go.

14:14.769 --> 14:17.367
Are you
Cindy's grandmother?

14:20.633 --> 14:23.300
No, you don't want to grab
that green light?

14:23.335 --> 14:25.700
Do you want
to talk to us?

14:28.900 --> 14:31.667
It's weird how sometimes
it just goes totally silent.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.798
It's so weird
that the activity stopped

14:40.833 --> 14:42.732
when we asked
if it was Cindy's grandmother.

14:42.767 --> 14:46.400
So, maybe there's another Mary
associated with the house

14:46.435 --> 14:47.933
that we just
haven't found yet.

14:47.968 --> 14:49.098
That we don't know.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.367
We haven't even dug into
the history yet, though.

14:51.402 --> 14:53.032
Right.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.032
Well, what I'll do
is tomorrow,

14:55.067 --> 14:56.700
I'm gonna go to,
like, the town hall,

14:56.735 --> 14:58.501
and I'll start
digging into the deeds

14:58.536 --> 15:00.267
and get names
associated with the house.

15:00.302 --> 15:01.498
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Okay.

15:01.533 --> 15:02.733
I'm going to set up
an experiment in the basement

15:02.768 --> 15:03.865
and see
if anything happens.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.167
All right, well,
let's do that, then.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.700
You know,
like all the cases we do,

15:12.735 --> 15:15.398
we rely intensely on research.

15:15.433 --> 15:17.067
I'm gonna dig into
the history of the house,

15:17.102 --> 15:20.200
the former owners, the land.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.833
I'm gonna set up the camera
here in the basement

15:26.868 --> 15:28.567
because this is where
that chair was on the table

15:28.602 --> 15:30.751
and it kind of
flipped off by itself.

15:30.786 --> 15:32.865
I'm gonna put a chair
on that table,

15:32.900 --> 15:36.933
and we're gonna monitor it and
see if we can catch anything.

15:40.633 --> 15:43.565
What did you
come across?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.883
Well, the man
who lived in this house

15:45.918 --> 15:48.167
before Carl and Cindy
was named Jim.

15:48.202 --> 15:51.067
He died of cancer
in 2010.

15:51.102 --> 15:52.298
He was 58.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.933
Basically, what happened was
this house originally...

15:54.968 --> 15:56.065
In 1930...

15:56.100 --> 15:58.567
A group of people,
they were probably related,

15:58.602 --> 16:00.532
they bought this plot.

16:00.567 --> 16:03.133
The previous owner Jim...
That was his family.

16:03.168 --> 16:07.298
It has been in his family
since 1930.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.483
Two of the women
who originally built the house

16:09.518 --> 16:11.525
and were in this original
group of people...

16:11.560 --> 16:13.533
One was named Mary,
and one was named Marie.

16:13.568 --> 16:15.498
In this house?
In this house.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.567
Our clients are
the first people that lived here

16:17.602 --> 16:19.632
that were not
relatives of Jim.

16:19.667 --> 16:23.167
That could be why the activity
started when they moved in.

16:23.202 --> 16:26.200
Let's focus on figuring out
which Mary is here.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.633
You want to start
in the basement?

16:27.668 --> 16:29.800
Yeah.

16:39.633 --> 16:41.300
Watch your head.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.865
Oh

16:43.900 --> 16:46.633
Watch your head.

16:49.167 --> 16:51.265
I'm trying to remember...
They had the foot...

16:51.300 --> 16:53.633
They hear footsteps upstairs
while they're down here, right?

16:53.668 --> 16:56.433
And then he had the chair
incident happen down here.

16:56.468 --> 16:59.165
That was
the major thing.

16:59.200 --> 17:02.067
Okay, I want to try
the spirit box for a little bit.

17:02.102 --> 17:04.733
Last night, something
definitely spoke to us.

17:04.768 --> 17:07.031
Since this entity wants to talk,

17:07.067 --> 17:09.432
we're using the spirit box
to make it easier.

17:09.467 --> 17:12.583
This device quickly
sweeps through radio channels.

17:12.617 --> 17:15.700
Spirits can sometimes
manipulate that white noise

17:15.734 --> 17:17.666
in order to get
a message across.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.500
So, if you're in here
with us,

17:22.535 --> 17:24.132
my name is Adam.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.132
This is Amy,
and if you talk,

17:27.166 --> 17:29.500
maybe we'll be able to hear you
through this little device

17:29.535 --> 17:31.700
that Amy's holding,
okay?

17:34.533 --> 17:36.500
Can you tell us
your name?

17:46.367 --> 17:48.283
Can you
try that again?

17:48.318 --> 17:50.200
Can you tell us
your name?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.067
Is this your house?

18:00.400 --> 18:03.633
Do you know
who Mary is?

18:07.067 --> 18:10.433
Did you just
hear someone upstairs?

18:10.468 --> 18:13.500
Yeah, I heard,
like, a thud.

18:13.535 --> 18:16.533
It's like a knock
or something.

18:16.568 --> 18:18.900
It's right above us.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.200
Right where you are is where it
sounded like it was coming from.

18:33.235 --> 18:34.367
Wait!

18:36.900 --> 18:39.233
Over here.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.483
Hello?

18:45.518 --> 18:47.767
Hello?

19:06.067 --> 19:10.300
I heard it again,
but up here.

19:10.335 --> 19:12.567
Hello?

19:34.233 --> 19:36.983
Definitely came
from the bedroom.

19:37.018 --> 19:39.042
Like, first it was
in the kitchen,

19:39.077 --> 19:41.067
then it goes up here
in the bedroom.

19:41.102 --> 19:42.867
I heard another, like, thud.

19:42.902 --> 19:44.633
Like, something stomping around.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.967
Hello?

20:04.133 --> 20:05.533
Adam?

20:05.568 --> 20:06.898
Yeah.

20:06.933 --> 20:10.832
I heard it
all the way up in the bedroom.

20:10.867 --> 20:14.300
So I went running up there
and there's nothing there.

20:14.335 --> 20:15.817
That's exactly
what they keep hearing.

20:15.852 --> 20:17.265
That's what I'm saying
is, like, that's...

20:17.300 --> 20:19.767
I was waiting for that
because they kept talking about

20:19.802 --> 20:21.551
this thud
that they heard all the time.

20:21.586 --> 20:23.093
And we've been here now
for two days

20:23.128 --> 20:24.514
and haven't heard it.
There it was.

20:24.549 --> 20:25.900
And that's what
they're hearing.

20:25.935 --> 20:27.165
Mm-hmm.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.967
It was weird because it happened
in the kitchen first,

20:30.002 --> 20:31.432
and then I went
chasing after it.

20:31.467 --> 20:33.133
And so it's almost like
whatever it was, like,

20:33.168 --> 20:35.800
was going upstairs
to get away from me.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.632
Let's use this.

20:40.667 --> 20:45.333
Whoever is here,
are you trying to hide from us?

20:51.500 --> 20:55.000
We know you get Carl and Cindy's
attention by big thuds,

20:55.035 --> 20:57.367
and we just heard one.

20:57.402 --> 20:59.700
Was that you?

21:04.333 --> 21:06.700
Can you
tell us your name?

21:27.233 --> 21:29.032
Mnh-mnh.

21:29.067 --> 21:32.233
Nothing's talking
to us right now.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.265
All right.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.700
Well...
Oh, god.

21:39.735 --> 21:41.200
Okay.

21:43.533 --> 21:47.533
I can honestly say right now
that we have not

21:47.568 --> 21:50.467
heard from Helen,
Carl's grandmother.

21:50.502 --> 21:53.032
At all?
Not a peep.

21:53.067 --> 21:56.298
But we do have
that "Mary" EVP.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.733
And the only Mary
they really confirmed for us

21:59.768 --> 22:01.732
was Cindy's grandmother.

22:01.767 --> 22:05.533
I don't think that it is
her grandmother at this point.

22:05.568 --> 22:07.265
We did find a lot...

22:07.300 --> 22:10.200
A Mary for sure
in the research.

22:10.235 --> 22:12.984
But we got nothing
on that.

22:13.019 --> 22:15.698
We need
Mary's last name.

22:15.733 --> 22:17.633
I think that
I'm going to call Stephanie,

22:17.668 --> 22:18.798
my friend,
the psychic.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.300
We'll just have her
do a walk-through

22:20.335 --> 22:21.265
real quick tomorrow.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.400
Just see
what she comes up with.

22:33.100 --> 22:35.683
I've invited
my friend Stephanie here.

22:35.718 --> 22:38.232
She's a very gifted
psychic medium.

22:38.267 --> 22:41.067
I just want her to come and do
a walk-through of the house

22:41.102 --> 22:43.433
and give us her impressions
and her feelings

22:43.468 --> 22:45.200
of what might be going on here.

22:45.235 --> 22:46.933
Pieces of evidence
and experiences

22:46.968 --> 22:48.732
that we've gotten so far...

22:48.767 --> 22:53.067
None of them have pointed
to anything definitive.

22:53.102 --> 22:55.001
We super appreciate
you coming out.

22:55.036 --> 22:56.865
I'm excited
to be with you guys again.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.967
If you wouldn't mind just doing
your thing and walking around...

23:00.467 --> 23:02.098
You got it.

23:02.133 --> 23:03.133
I'm going to go this way.

23:03.168 --> 23:04.300
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.733
All right.
Let's go this way.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.898
Mm-hmm.

23:15.933 --> 23:17.533
We're going upstairs.

23:17.568 --> 23:19.133
Okay.
All right.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.300
All right,
I'm going to go this way.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.367
Watch your head.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.950
Okay.

23:40.985 --> 23:42.698
Whew.

23:42.733 --> 23:44.365
I found it.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.333
I saw a man standing
in that back corner.

23:59.067 --> 24:02.067
All right,
I'm going to go this way.

24:02.102 --> 24:03.834
Okay.

24:03.869 --> 24:05.532
Whew.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.032
I found it.

24:08.067 --> 24:10.067
I saw a man standing
in that back corner.

24:12.533 --> 24:15.332
He kind of just wants me
to go away.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.233
I don't really understand
what he's trying to say to me,

24:17.268 --> 24:20.750
but I'm going to go
with, like, a "J" name.

24:20.785 --> 24:24.233
So he's just saying,
"Like, I'm down here.

24:24.268 --> 24:25.400
Like,
leave me be."

24:25.435 --> 24:26.798
Mm-hmm.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.233
He comes up, he does his thing.
It's what he says, like,

24:29.268 --> 24:31.567
"Nobody gets in my way. I do
what I need to."

24:31.602 --> 24:32.865
"Sometimes,
I bump into things."

24:32.900 --> 24:35.833
But he's talking about
a music connection, too.

24:35.868 --> 24:38.317
A music connection?
Yeah.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.732
He's talking about
the music.

24:40.767 --> 24:44.467
Every once in a while,
I'll hear, like, music.

24:44.502 --> 24:45.500
That makes sense,
actually.

24:45.535 --> 24:46.498
Does it?
Mm-hmm.

24:46.533 --> 24:47.533
That does make sense.
Mm-hmm.

24:47.568 --> 24:48.498
Okay.
Yep.

24:48.533 --> 24:49.565
I mean,
I've asked him

24:49.600 --> 24:50.765
every question
in the book at this point,

24:50.800 --> 24:53.667
and he's just kind of
shooing me out the door.

24:53.702 --> 24:55.232
Okay.

24:55.267 --> 24:56.983
He has the homeowners
right now,

24:57.018 --> 24:58.665
who are
very sweet people...

24:58.700 --> 25:01.167
They keep kind of
second-guessing themselves.

25:01.202 --> 25:02.265
The way
he's acting is like,

25:02.300 --> 25:04.183
"I'm just
going about my daily..."

25:04.218 --> 25:06.067
Yeah.
"...thing. Like, I'm not..."

25:06.102 --> 25:08.133
Like, him upsetting somebody.

25:08.168 --> 25:09.365
Yeah.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.867
He's acknowledging that
they're not in his way.

25:11.902 --> 25:13.232
Right. Mm-hmm.

25:13.267 --> 25:14.767
But he's still
doing his job.

25:14.802 --> 25:16.298
Okay.

25:16.333 --> 25:19.067
I'm going to
go this way.

25:21.267 --> 25:23.167
Up here, I feel like
there's different energies

25:23.202 --> 25:24.898
that are coming in...

25:24.933 --> 25:27.700
Coming from up here and then
down in the basement room.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.800
So the older guy that I saw
in the basement...

25:42.600 --> 25:45.800
...wants really nothing
to do with talking to me.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.598
I would say...
I mean, I say, "older,"

25:47.633 --> 25:52.733
but he's showing me himself
almost like 50s, 60s.

25:52.768 --> 25:54.032
Okay,
he's showing me his hands,

25:54.067 --> 25:55.867
and he's showing me
that they're dirty.

25:58.267 --> 26:01.317
He doesn't have a problem
getting his hands dirty...

26:01.352 --> 26:04.367
Worked with something that
caused his hands to be dirty.

26:04.402 --> 26:05.498
He's not
really comfortable

26:05.533 --> 26:07.167
with the overflow
of people in the house.

26:07.202 --> 26:08.634
Okay.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.032
At all.

26:10.067 --> 26:11.298
Up until now,

26:11.333 --> 26:13.532
we've only been
investigating one spirit.

26:13.567 --> 26:17.400
Stephanie picking up on
a second one changes everything.

26:21.833 --> 26:25.533
This has gone
totally a different direction

26:25.568 --> 26:27.032
than I expected.

26:27.067 --> 26:29.900
I was worried at first
because it took her a minute.

26:29.935 --> 26:31.467
There's a lot
of energy going on.

26:31.502 --> 26:32.798
Yes,
and she said that.

26:32.833 --> 26:35.400
She said there's
multiple energies in here,

26:35.435 --> 26:36.984
which makes
a lot of sense.

26:37.019 --> 26:38.498
The name Mary
keeps coming up.

26:38.533 --> 26:40.666
I really think
she picked up on Jim.

26:40.701 --> 26:42.800
She said that he was
in his 50s or 60s.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.284
Mm-hmm.
The "J" name.

26:44.319 --> 26:45.698
A "J" name.
Right.

26:45.733 --> 26:47.933
It makes sense why he's not
talking to us a lot.

26:47.968 --> 26:49.598
Mm-hmm.
He's not interested in us.

26:49.633 --> 26:52.200
He's just doing his thing.
Like, this is his house still.

26:52.235 --> 26:53.517
Right.

26:53.552 --> 26:54.765
So...

26:54.800 --> 26:59.233
It makes sense to me
that Jim would still be here.

26:59.268 --> 27:01.398
He's lived here
his entire life.

27:01.433 --> 27:03.700
But I think we need
to look into Jim.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.067
Based on what Stephanie
says, I mean, who knows?

27:08.102 --> 27:09.534
Maybe Jim still is here.

27:09.569 --> 27:10.932
But we don't know yet.

27:10.967 --> 27:13.900
I mean, our instincts
are telling us that obviously,

27:13.935 --> 27:15.967
Jim would be the culprit
in this house

27:16.002 --> 27:17.365
based on the things
that we know.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.767
But there's no way to really
determine exactly who is there

27:20.802 --> 27:22.334
until we get confirmation.

27:22.369 --> 27:23.832
Hi!
You must be David.

27:23.867 --> 27:25.333
Hi, how are you?
How you doing?

27:25.368 --> 27:26.800
Hi, I'm Amy.
Hi, Amy. I'm Adam.

27:26.835 --> 27:28.217
Hi, Adam.
How are you?

27:28.252 --> 27:29.876
This is Jim's cousin Dave.

27:29.911 --> 27:31.465
He has been in the house.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.333
He knew Jim very well,
and we're going to get a chance

27:34.368 --> 27:36.265
to speak with him
about who Jim was

27:36.300 --> 27:38.433
and get to know a little bit
more about the house.

27:38.468 --> 27:40.733
You spent
a lot of time here, I take it?

27:40.768 --> 27:42.232
I spent
some time here.

27:42.267 --> 27:43.833
Yeah. Yeah.
It was a lot different.

27:43.868 --> 27:45.365
We heard
he had a lot of stuff.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.433
Oh, my god.
He had so much stuff in here.

27:48.468 --> 27:50.117
It was, like,
unbelievable.

27:50.152 --> 27:51.767
Mm-hmm.
Jimmy was a great guy.

27:51.802 --> 27:52.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.700
You know, he was.
Jimmy was a great guy.

27:54.735 --> 27:57.265
The way he went,
it wasn't...

27:57.300 --> 27:59.067
Yeah, we heard.
It was a bad thing.

27:59.102 --> 28:00.600
We heard
he died of cancer.

28:00.635 --> 28:01.798
That's terrible.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.800
And they put him under...
He was in a coma.

28:04.835 --> 28:05.765
Mm.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.767
And he never...
He never came out of it.

28:07.802 --> 28:09.332
No.
He never came out.

28:09.367 --> 28:11.867
You know, he came to my house
when he got sick.

28:11.902 --> 28:13.032
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.133
And he begged me
to take his business over.

28:15.168 --> 28:16.734
Ohh.
So he had a business?

28:16.769 --> 28:18.300
Yes.
What was his business?

28:18.335 --> 28:19.600
He did construction.

28:19.635 --> 28:20.598
Okay.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.433
Did Jim have
a connection to music

28:22.468 --> 28:24.198
at all
that you would know of?

28:24.233 --> 28:27.933
I mean, we used to go upstairs
in the attic

28:27.968 --> 28:30.565
and, you know,
listen to music.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.967
He had... all his music stuff
was upstairs.

28:34.002 --> 28:35.984
I know he had
drum sets up there,

28:36.019 --> 28:37.967
he had reel-to-reel,
he had...

28:38.002 --> 28:40.300
You name it,
he had it.

28:40.335 --> 28:42.032
Yeah,
he... he...

28:42.067 --> 28:46.200
God, loved going around
listening to music.

28:46.235 --> 28:47.498
Okay.

28:47.533 --> 28:51.167
What do you think Jim
would think of the house now?

28:51.202 --> 28:54.233
Jim would probably say...

28:54.268 --> 28:55.798
"Finally."

28:55.833 --> 28:57.532
Yeah.
You know?

28:57.567 --> 29:01.733
Jimmy would be very happy
to see this house like it is.

29:01.768 --> 29:03.200
Well, thank you for
taking the time.

29:03.235 --> 29:04.751
No problem.
It's been super helpful.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.267
It's always nice
to get some background

29:06.302 --> 29:07.632
on who
we're looking for.

29:07.667 --> 29:09.532
Dave's information
about Jim backs up.

29:09.567 --> 29:12.867
Stephanie's findings, but we
still don't know who Mary is.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.850
We already investigated
two separate Marys...

29:17.885 --> 29:20.142
Cindy's grandmother
and the former homeowner.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.400
We're putting motion detectors
in the kitchen,

29:22.435 --> 29:23.800
which is where
they hear the footsteps

29:23.835 --> 29:25.733
and where the stove turned off.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.450
It's totally working.

29:29.485 --> 29:30.932
All right.
We're good.

29:30.967 --> 29:33.500
And since the female voice
calls out to Carl,

29:33.535 --> 29:34.898
we need to get him back in here.

29:34.933 --> 29:38.700
Maybe he'll have
some more information for us.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.832
I did have
a quick question for you.

29:40.867 --> 29:45.833
Is there anybody
in your history named Mary?

29:45.868 --> 29:48.467
Yes.
Who would that be?

29:48.502 --> 29:51.032
I have an aunt
named Mary.

29:51.067 --> 29:53.233
So, your aunt, though,
is still living?

29:53.268 --> 29:54.332
No.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.100
My aunt Mary is dead.

29:56.135 --> 29:57.833
What was her last name?

29:57.868 --> 29:59.332
McCardle.

29:59.367 --> 30:01.650
And that was
a bad death.

30:01.685 --> 30:03.933
She veered
off the road...

30:03.968 --> 30:05.184
Oh, my god.

30:05.219 --> 30:06.365
Ohh. Okay.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.400
And were you close
with her?

30:07.435 --> 30:08.498
Yes.
Okay.

30:08.533 --> 30:09.816
Yep.
All right.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.065
That's helpful.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.900
I can't say any details
really further beyond...

30:13.935 --> 30:15.065
Okay.
...the question.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.200
We'll see what
we get to tell you tomorrow.

30:17.235 --> 30:19.400
Oh.
Sounds good.

30:22.467 --> 30:26.100
So first of all, do you think
that's our Mary?

30:26.135 --> 30:27.732
I mean,
it's another Mary,

30:27.767 --> 30:29.232
and it's more connected
to him.

30:29.267 --> 30:31.100
Maybe potentially,
we'll know more tonight

30:31.135 --> 30:32.298
when we investigate,

30:32.333 --> 30:34.767
but, I mean, I know
there's been a lot of Marys,

30:34.802 --> 30:36.598
but what are the odds?
Right.

30:36.633 --> 30:37.900
Obviously,
we have to investigate it

30:37.935 --> 30:38.865
and we have to see,

30:38.900 --> 30:40.233
but we have
a first and last name.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.633
All right,
here we are.

30:58.533 --> 31:00.698
We'll do
an EVP session first.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.300
What if I do it
by myself somewhere?

31:03.335 --> 31:05.098
Because...
Yes, yes. Go.

31:05.133 --> 31:06.866
I mean, like,
completely by myself.

31:06.901 --> 31:08.565
Yeah.
Women-to-women... it's fine.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.267
You want to just do it
in here by yourself?

31:10.302 --> 31:11.432
Okay.

31:11.467 --> 31:13.467
You good?
Yep.

31:23.067 --> 31:28.083
Okay, Amy, I am
watching you on the dvr.

31:28.118 --> 31:33.065
So right now,
Amy is alone in the bedroom,

31:33.100 --> 31:35.883
and she's gonna try
to speak to whoever it is...

31:35.918 --> 31:38.667
Whatever Mary that's been
reaching out to us...

31:38.702 --> 31:40.367
All by herself.

31:42.533 --> 31:44.498
<i>Okay, Mary.</i>

31:44.533 --> 31:48.533
<i>It's just me now,
Amy.</i>

31:48.568 --> 31:49.798
<i>And...</i>

31:49.833 --> 31:53.032
<i>I'm just wondering
if maybe</i>

31:53.067 --> 31:55.067
<i>would you prefer
to just talk to me?</i>

32:08.267 --> 32:09.532
That's not me.

32:09.567 --> 32:13.100
I did not see anybody
moving in the kitchen,

32:13.135 --> 32:14.667
and I'm staring
at the kitchen.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.400
This whole bed
is shaking.

32:37.200 --> 32:41.700
So right now Amy is alone
in the bedroom.

32:41.735 --> 32:43.632
<i>Okay, Mary.</i>

32:43.667 --> 32:46.598
<i>It's just me now,
Amy.</i>

32:46.633 --> 32:49.267
<i>I'm just wondering
if maybe would you prefer</i>

32:49.302 --> 32:51.600
<i>to just talk to me?</i>

32:58.567 --> 32:59.798
That's not me.

32:59.833 --> 33:02.833
I did not see anybody
moving in the kitchen,

33:02.868 --> 33:06.500
and I'm staring
at the kitchen.

33:06.535 --> 33:08.500
This whole bed
is shaking.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.332
<i>Well,
if you're here,</i>

33:19.367 --> 33:22.500
<i>I don't know if you're
trying to reach out to them</i>

33:22.535 --> 33:25.198
<i>so they can tell
your story</i>

33:25.233 --> 33:28.167
<i>or if you're just confused
or a little lost.</i>

33:30.067 --> 33:34.133
I mean,
we've been split up for...

33:34.168 --> 33:36.298
Maybe five minutes?

33:36.333 --> 33:39.167
The motion sensor
keeps going off.

33:39.202 --> 33:42.398
That's not me.

33:42.433 --> 33:46.267
I'm going to
listen to the recorder.

34:14.567 --> 34:16.665
Adam,
it's quiet.

34:16.699 --> 34:20.067
I mean, I didn't get anything
on the recorder.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.500
I think
you should come back.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.197
Hi.

34:31.233 --> 34:34.732
So while
you were down there

34:34.766 --> 34:36.917
and I was up here by myself,
it was just...

34:36.952 --> 34:39.067
All this stuff
started happening all at once.

34:39.101 --> 34:40.232
Okay.

34:40.266 --> 34:41.364
So stuff was happening,

34:41.400 --> 34:43.933
but my EVP session
came up empty.

34:43.967 --> 34:45.032
Okay.

34:45.067 --> 34:46.032
Use that
as a backup,

34:46.067 --> 34:47.600
and I'm going to put out
two more K-IIs

34:47.635 --> 34:50.400
and see
if we get anything.

34:50.435 --> 34:53.532
Let's do this.

34:53.567 --> 34:54.817
By the way,
if you're in here

34:54.851 --> 34:56.032
and you want
to interact with us,

34:56.067 --> 35:00.467
you can grab any
of these devices that you see.

35:00.502 --> 35:01.832
We know...

35:01.867 --> 35:07.067
We <i>know</i> someone is here
with Carl and Cindy.

35:07.102 --> 35:11.167
And we really
need to tell them

35:11.202 --> 35:15.198
who you are
and why you're here.

35:15.233 --> 35:19.633
So please, can you just tell us
your first and last name?

35:24.800 --> 35:26.800
Why are you here?

35:30.833 --> 35:33.565
So, whoever's here,
I'm sure you've heard

35:33.600 --> 35:39.300
Carl and Cindy talk about
how frustrated they are

35:39.335 --> 35:43.032
because of whatever it is
that you do.

35:43.067 --> 35:45.367
I think that if
they just knew who you were

35:45.402 --> 35:47.801
and that you don't
mean any harm,

35:47.836 --> 35:50.200
they wouldn't be
so frustrated.

35:53.233 --> 35:56.183
The K-II
just went off.

35:56.218 --> 35:59.133
Okay,
so let me record.

36:02.300 --> 36:05.098
Is this
Mary McCardle

36:05.133 --> 36:08.365
that's grabbing
these boxes in front?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.800
If that's you, can you grab on
to those boxes again, please?

36:14.767 --> 36:17.133
Can you do it
on the count of three?

36:20.533 --> 36:23.083
One...

36:23.118 --> 36:26.025
Two...

36:26.060 --> 36:28.933
Three.

36:40.567 --> 36:43.565
Is this Mary McCardle?

36:43.600 --> 36:46.933
If that's you,
can you grab onto those boxes?

36:49.067 --> 36:51.833
Can you do it
on the count of three?

36:51.868 --> 36:55.067
One... two... three.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.600
That's insane to me.

37:01.635 --> 37:04.401
They're both going off.

37:04.436 --> 37:07.167
Are you Mary McCardle?

37:08.167 --> 37:10.500
Mary McCardle,
if that's you...

37:15.200 --> 37:17.500
Mary McCardle?

37:17.535 --> 37:19.765
Every time.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.767
Why are you here?

37:24.500 --> 37:27.967
Would you like to give Carl
a message now?

37:29.567 --> 37:31.533
Would you like
to stay here?

37:35.067 --> 37:37.565
Are you still here?

37:37.600 --> 37:39.398
I know it takes
a lot of energy.

37:39.433 --> 37:44.400
She might have used it up
communicating with the K-IIs.

37:44.435 --> 37:46.298
Why would she be here?

37:46.333 --> 37:51.967
Why would she pick Carl
to communicate with?

37:52.002 --> 37:53.332
We have
a lot of great things.

37:53.367 --> 37:55.100
Like, we have a lot
of good things...

37:55.135 --> 37:56.065
Mm-hmm.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.398
...to talk about.
Oh, yeah!

37:57.433 --> 37:59.300
I mean, we still have to review
the evidence from tonight.

37:59.335 --> 38:00.932
The real question is,

38:00.967 --> 38:04.500
will they find comfort
in what we're telling them?

38:04.535 --> 38:06.698
Mm-hmm.
Let's pack it up...

38:06.733 --> 38:09.533
All right.
...And reconvene tomorrow.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.298
Well,
I can tell you

38:23.333 --> 38:26.316
that of all the cases
we've done,

38:26.351 --> 38:29.300
this one left us
scratching our heads

38:29.335 --> 38:31.633
until the last
possible moment.

38:31.668 --> 38:33.417
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

38:33.452 --> 38:35.132
We had experiences

38:35.167 --> 38:37.867
that you guys have had
on many occasions,

38:37.902 --> 38:40.567
and so we're able
to validate a lot of that.

38:40.602 --> 38:43.767
We both experienced
footsteps upstairs

38:43.802 --> 38:45.584
while we were down here.
Yeah.

38:45.619 --> 38:47.332
And we definitely
got the vibe

38:47.367 --> 38:49.867
that whatever it was
was kind of avoiding us,

38:49.902 --> 38:51.332
where we would be
in one place,

38:51.367 --> 38:53.067
it would be making noise
somewhere else.

38:53.102 --> 38:54.651
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

38:54.686 --> 38:56.165
We think we know why.

38:56.200 --> 39:00.533
And so we'll play
some of this evidence for you.

39:00.568 --> 39:02.098
The first thing
I'll show you is

39:02.133 --> 39:04.833
we were investigating
in your bedroom.

39:04.868 --> 39:07.117
<i>Have you seen
one of these before?</i>

39:07.152 --> 39:09.367
<i>If you have,
make it light up.</i>

39:11.733 --> 39:13.832
Wow.

39:13.867 --> 39:16.167
And on the same night,
we got this.

39:16.202 --> 39:17.365
This was
the first EVP

39:17.400 --> 39:20.598
that we caught
as we were investigating.

39:20.633 --> 39:23.567
So, and you can just tell me
what you think it says.

39:23.602 --> 39:24.898
<i>What about Mary?</i>

39:24.933 --> 39:26.900
<i>Is someone here
named Mary?</i>

39:29.733 --> 39:31.967
Mary is here.
Oh, my god.

39:32.002 --> 39:32.932
- Right?
- Yeah.

39:32.967 --> 39:34.900
Mary. Is. Here.
Mm-hmm.

39:34.935 --> 39:38.198
Wow.

39:38.233 --> 39:41.516
Because the activity
seemed to be around you so much,

39:41.551 --> 39:44.800
so we thought, "Is it a Mary
that's associated you?"

39:44.835 --> 39:46.733
So that's why
we did ask you that.

39:46.768 --> 39:48.232
We went back
to the K-IIs

39:48.267 --> 39:50.967
because it was getting
such a good response.

39:51.002 --> 39:53.467
And so I said,
"Is this Mary McCardle?"

39:53.502 --> 39:54.432
Ba-da-ding!

39:54.467 --> 39:55.933
And I said,
"Mary McCardle."

39:55.968 --> 39:57.498
Ba-ring!

39:57.533 --> 40:00.533
Are you Mary McCardle?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.567
Every time.

40:05.602 --> 40:07.032
Wow!

40:07.067 --> 40:11.132
That was, like, kind of
the final... we have our Mary.

40:11.167 --> 40:15.267
Would you have any idea why
she would be hanging around you?

40:15.302 --> 40:16.833
My god.
She was my godmother.

40:16.868 --> 40:18.365
Oh!

40:18.400 --> 40:19.783
Oh, my god.
There we go.

40:19.818 --> 40:21.109
I get goosebumps.
I feel...

40:21.144 --> 40:22.365
- There it is!
- Mm-hmm.

40:22.400 --> 40:24.267
Get out, oh, my god.
I got wicked goosebumps.

40:25.433 --> 40:27.565
She's probably
checking in on you.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.333
I mean, even if she's not here
all the time,

40:30.368 --> 40:31.732
she's probably,
like,

40:31.767 --> 40:34.400
doing her
godmotherly duties, you know?

40:34.435 --> 40:35.798
Yeah.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.432
Your aunt
pops in and out,

40:37.467 --> 40:39.450
but the thuds,
things being moved,

40:39.485 --> 40:41.676
the stove,
doesn't seem like Mary.

40:41.711 --> 40:44.239
And as we have learned,
many times,

40:44.274 --> 40:46.732
who we expect
is not usually who it is.

40:46.767 --> 40:49.050
So we were trying
to figure out who Mary was,

40:49.085 --> 40:51.333
and we brought in
one of my good friends.

40:51.368 --> 40:52.998
Stephanie is...

40:53.033 --> 40:55.766
I consider to be
a very gifted psychic.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.500
And she did a walk-through
of your house.

40:58.535 --> 41:01.901
And immediately,
she walked in,

41:01.936 --> 41:05.232
and she said
there was a man here.

41:05.267 --> 41:07.798
I saw a man
standing in that back corner.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.400
He comes up, he does his thing,
is what he says.

41:10.435 --> 41:12.384
Like, "Sometimes,
I bump into things."

41:12.419 --> 41:14.333
And she was able
to exactly describe

41:14.368 --> 41:16.217
the former homeowner Jim.

41:16.252 --> 41:18.032
That's cool.
So, yeah.

41:18.067 --> 41:20.867
We think, like, most of
your activity is attributed

41:20.902 --> 41:22.265
probably to Jim.

41:22.300 --> 41:25.898
We think he's the one
that's moving things around.

41:25.933 --> 41:28.867
Maybe accidently hitting the bed
as he goes by, like...

41:28.902 --> 41:30.332
- Yes.
- Ah!

41:30.367 --> 41:31.798
Which also
could explain the stove.

41:31.833 --> 41:34.450
He's bumping into things...
Moving them.

41:34.485 --> 41:37.032
But that he doesn't even know
he's doing it.

41:37.067 --> 41:40.600
If you experience something,
you know, say out loud...

41:40.635 --> 41:42.398
Just let him know
what his...

41:42.433 --> 41:44.600
What the boundaries are,
'cause he may not realize it.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.267
That makes me
feel good.

41:46.302 --> 41:47.465
Yeah.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.433
But I think now that you know
the motivation

41:49.468 --> 41:51.500
and now that you understand
who is behind it,

41:51.535 --> 41:53.533
it kind of puts it into
a different perspective.

41:53.568 --> 41:55.133
Yeah.
And there's no malice behind it.

41:55.168 --> 41:56.332
None.

41:56.367 --> 41:58.867
And along those lines,
we don't think you have anything

41:58.902 --> 42:00.767
to worry about
as far as it escalating

42:00.802 --> 42:02.365
to something
more serious.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.732
So we brought Stephanie
here with us today.

42:04.767 --> 42:07.967
We were hoping we could just
kind of all of us get together,

42:08.002 --> 42:10.900
and she'll kind of be
the go-between.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.166
Carl and Cindy
accept the former homeowner Jim

42:15.201 --> 42:17.750
just wants to stay in the home
where he grew up.

42:17.785 --> 42:20.476
Welcoming Jim and establishing
clear boundaries

42:20.511 --> 42:23.132
should cut down on the activity
that bothered them.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.467
He had said that it wasn't
necessarily a family connection,

42:26.502 --> 42:29.067
but he considered
you guys family.

42:29.102 --> 42:30.032
Beautiful.

42:30.067 --> 42:31.398
- Oh, that'll work.
- Yeah.

42:31.433 --> 42:33.600
I love seeing the shift
to just fully accepting it.

42:33.635 --> 42:34.698
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

42:34.733 --> 42:36.300
And realizing
the motivation.

42:36.335 --> 42:37.867
I feel peaceful.
I... yeah.

42:37.902 --> 42:39.332
I do.

42:39.367 --> 42:41.267
I haven't really felt like this
in a long time.

42:41.302 --> 42:42.565
It is
a different feeling.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.832
We connected
with Carl's aunt Mary.

42:44.867 --> 42:47.783
Knowing she's here to
watch over him gave him peace.

42:47.818 --> 42:50.709
Nothing in this house
is aggressive or negative,

42:50.744 --> 42:53.600
and Carl and Cindy
can finally feel comfortable

42:53.635 --> 42:54.800
in their own home.
