WEBVTT

00:07.049 --> 00:09.176
I've been meaning to talk with you.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.054
It's terrifying, isn't it?

00:13.471 --> 00:16.474
The president and I
have a simple request.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.311
Tell us what you see.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.657
If anything in your environment
strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off,

00:24.692 --> 00:26.408
pick up the phone.

00:26.443 --> 00:30.203
Whether it's a package or a
person that seems out of place,

00:30.238 --> 00:32.031
we'd love you to let us know.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.786
Because there's a lot of
noise out there these days.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.129
A noisy press that's
choosing to dwell on the past

00:39.164 --> 00:41.291
instead of what's happening right now.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.419
My husband and I want to protect you.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.138
In two weeks' time, you will
be heading to the ballot box

00:48.173 --> 00:51.426
to decide what kind of
country you want to live in.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.054
It's a profound choice.

00:55.013 --> 00:59.567
But no matter who wins this election,
we're going to need to work together,

00:59.602 --> 01:01.443
watch out for each other,

01:01.478 --> 01:04.029
and, yes, watch each other,

01:04.063 --> 01:06.358
to keep us all safe and sound.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.694
Tell us what you see.

01:09.612 --> 01:12.996
My name is Claire Underwood,
and I approve this message.

01:15.450 --> 01:16.827
Should we do one more?

01:34.511 --> 01:36.269
Did the Democrats show?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.814
They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.849
- Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.

01:40.851 --> 01:44.402
My fellow congressmen, I do
not need the Washington Herald

01:44.437 --> 01:47.906
to tell me that a scoundrel
lives in the White House.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.700
I can see the Democrats are here.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.862
They're eager to debate.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.780
I say to the gentlemen on
the other side of the aisle...

01:54.782 --> 01:56.539
- thank you.
- Go.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.792
Should we investigate the president

01:58.827 --> 02:01.503
for crimes committed while
he was vice president?

02:01.538 --> 02:04.422
I say, yes. Let's debate.

02:04.457 --> 02:08.969
Let's debate this miscreant
all day and all night.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.806
Madam Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.090
The gentleman from Georgia

02:14.092 --> 02:15.884
may state the nature of
his parliamentary inquiry.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.886
Do the rules of the House not require

02:17.888 --> 02:20.105
the president be formally
invited in order to attend?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.556
Madam Speaker, if I may...

02:21.558 --> 02:23.642
The Speaker recognizes the
gentleman from South Carolina.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.820
The president is wearing
his congressional pin today

02:26.855 --> 02:29.907
and is thereby welcome to
any and all proceedings.

02:29.942 --> 02:32.325
Madam Speaker! Madam Speaker!

02:33.486 --> 02:34.703
Rules of the House state

02:34.738 --> 02:36.914
that former members are
not allowed on the floor

02:36.949 --> 02:38.999
when they have interest
in the matter under debate.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.500
Madam Speaker,

02:40.535 --> 02:45.005
the president has no interest or opinion
on the matter being debated today.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.790
The House suspend.
The House will suspend.

02:48.794 --> 02:53.180
Madam Speaker, I still do have the
floor, and I find it hard to believe

02:53.215 --> 02:56.893
the president wouldn't have an
opinion on the matter being discussed.

02:56.896 --> 03:01.021
If the good gentleman from Florida
would yield a portion of his time,

03:01.056 --> 03:05.643
I assure him it will satisfy his query.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.530
I yield three minutes to the leader.

03:10.565 --> 03:14.451
And I yield my time to the former
congressman from South Carolina

03:14.486 --> 03:16.954
and the President of the United States.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.327
Point of order! Parliamentary inquiry!

03:23.161 --> 03:24.830
Parliamentary inquiry!

03:26.206 --> 03:28.340
Parliamentary inquiry!

03:28.375 --> 03:30.550
Mr. President. This is beyond the norm.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.004
I don't care.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.340
I don't care.

03:36.133 --> 03:41.436
And I also do not care about
your investigative committees.

03:41.471 --> 03:45.517
No, that is not what I care about today.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.772
The House will cease.

03:51.523 --> 03:55.235
That is not what I care about today.

03:56.862 --> 04:02.415
I am on my way to the funeral
of an American patriot.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.789
A good man, a husband...

04:08.165 --> 04:13.211
a father... who was
beheaded on American soil.

04:14.421 --> 04:19.141
And this chamber chooses to debate me?

04:20.177 --> 04:22.602
- The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak

04:22.637 --> 04:26.648
to a full session of this chamber
and my requests were denied.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.359
- Madam Speaker!
- Mr. President, you must yield the floor.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.940
I will not yield, Madam Speaker.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.991
Because I cannot wait.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.532
One of the murderers...

04:45.660 --> 04:49.462
One of the murderers who
killed Mr. Jim Miller...

04:49.497 --> 04:51.506
is still out there.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.251
At large.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.680
How much more proof do you people need?

05:01.468 --> 05:06.188
I demand that every member
of this House take a stand.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.983
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.

05:10.018 --> 05:12.194
I demand that this Congress

05:12.229 --> 05:18.033
declare a formal declaration of war
against ICO, both here and abroad.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.534
Motion to adjourn.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.152
- Second!
- The House will adjourn.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.789
- The president will cease.
- I will not cease!

05:23.824 --> 05:26.201
I will never cease.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.628
I demand that this Congress
declare a state of war

05:30.663 --> 05:36.384
has existed and does exist between
ICO and the United States of America.

05:36.419 --> 05:40.722
And I demand that every member
of this House stay in this chamber

05:40.757 --> 05:45.602
for as long as it takes, until
you bring my request to a vote.

05:45.637 --> 05:51.024
Or you will all go down
in history as cowards!

05:51.059 --> 05:52.567
Cowards!

05:52.602 --> 05:54.903
The sergeant at arms
will remove the president.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.531
Madam Speaker, I
repeat. I demand a vote.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.277
I will not yield.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.328
I will not yield.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.950
I will not yield.

07:31.010 --> 07:35.143

07:44.131 --> 07:47.349
Alleged terrorist Zachary
Hawthorne was killed by the FBI,

07:47.384 --> 07:50.185
but Joshua Masterson is still at large.

07:50.220 --> 07:53.646
While the Miller family mourns, the
hunt for the missing terrorist continues

07:53.681 --> 07:55.815
and tensions are running high.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.775
The president may be asking for war,

07:57.810 --> 08:01.321
but it seems war's already
been declared on him.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.745
My fans.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.422
FBI is looking into a multiple
shooting in Chattanooga.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.127
- Reports have it gang related.
- No.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.973
A private plane went down in
West Virginia. Mechanical failure.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.100
A series of homes were
set on fire in Georgia,

08:30.135 --> 08:31.476
most likely arson.

08:31.511 --> 08:36.523
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina
exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.734
- Where's the store?
- Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.604
The cause is still under investigation.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.365
- I'll make an appearance.
- Yes, ma'am.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.118
Just put it on the schedule so
the media has time to mobilize.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.571
Yes, ma'am.

09:08.590 --> 09:12.059
I take it the president has
declared war on Joshua Masterson.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.221
He never should've
kicked me off that call.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.772
But this morning isn't about politics.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.232
That's right.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.194
We need to show some
compassion for the living.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.272
And respect for the dead.

09:30.487 --> 09:32.245
The family's agreed to a moment.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.325
No press, no speeches, but we
should be able to pull something.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.037
- Mr. President.
- Governor.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.052
Do they not realize what
we've done for them already?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.970
I pointed that out, sir, but...

09:49.005 --> 09:51.514
the daughter's medicated and
very fragile at the moment.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.550
All right.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.345
Mrs. Miller.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.974
- I'm so very sorry.
- Thank you.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.941
And I promise you,

10:01.976 --> 10:06.488
I will not stop until everyone
responsible for this terrible tragedy

10:06.523 --> 10:08.233
is brought to justice.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.154
And I swear to you,
as God is my witness...

10:12.945 --> 10:16.581
no one will ever harm you
or your family ever again.

10:16.616 --> 10:20.627
The nation mourns with you
and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.207
- Thank you. If you don't mind...
- Of course.

10:30.505 --> 10:31.673
Mr. President.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.550
I'll be right along.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.768
It's a busy day for you today, sir.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.264
It's a sad, sad day.

10:39.847 --> 10:42.315
It's a shame things didn't
turn out differently.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.354
Yes. Well, some things are
bigger than the two of us, Will.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.900
I don't want him here!

10:52.902 --> 10:55.662
Calm down, Melissa. Please.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.080
It's his fault. He's dead.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.375
- Daddy's dead. He killed him.
- Please.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.495
Give me a minute.

11:03.913 --> 11:07.382
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes. Okay? Yes.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.585
Yes!

11:10.878 --> 11:15.300
You do. You think about what you
would say on a day like today.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.261
If a day like today were to happen.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.646
But you let it pass...

11:21.681 --> 11:24.982
because you know you have so
much more left ahead of you.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.688
So much to do together.

11:30.232 --> 11:34.326
You think... You think 40 minutes...

11:35.695 --> 11:37.954
If we were late 40 minutes...

11:37.989 --> 11:40.332
Or two, or one...

11:40.367 --> 11:44.544
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...

11:46.581 --> 11:50.627
But to dwell in the past,
to live in what-ifs...

11:52.337 --> 11:54.171
That wasn't my husband.

11:56.299 --> 11:57.509
That wasn't us...

11:59.302 --> 12:00.678
- Honey...
- Please.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
Okay. Come on.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.020
I need to...

12:13.483 --> 12:15.485
I wanted to say about my father...

12:17.820 --> 12:21.991
He was so strong... so brave.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.830
My father was taking us to...

12:31.167 --> 12:32.502
My father...

12:33.670 --> 12:36.638
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- My father...

12:36.673 --> 12:39.801
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.

12:40.677 --> 12:42.394
Melissa...

12:44.764 --> 12:47.524
It's all right, Melissa. We understand.

12:47.559 --> 12:51.688
I hope you die and
she becomes president.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.587
What did the girl say to you?

13:17.213 --> 13:21.634
She said she hopes I die and
that you become the president.

13:29.976 --> 13:34.321
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy
Director Michaels from the NSA.

13:34.356 --> 13:38.067
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.

13:41.363 --> 13:44.622
There's been raids as far up as
New York and down to the panhandle.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.665
As of now,

13:45.700 --> 13:49.544
Green's focusing in on the border
between Virginia and North Carolina.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.379
Seth has a statement
ready for this afternoon.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.255
No. The best statement is no statement.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.293
Besides, I want Claire to be the
voice on this until we're ready.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.920
Yes, sir.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.723
- Quite a crowd out there.
- Well, we better bring Birch in first.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.015
Yes, sir.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.428
Congressman Birch.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.229
Bob.

14:08.264 --> 14:11.483
Well, that was a little bit of
history this morning, wasn't it?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.860
- It certainly was.
- I couldn't see it any other way.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.403
No disagreement from here.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.071
Well, you know how the Republicans are.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.615
Anything but a decision.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.450
They mistake complaint for leadership.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.285
Well, instead of a
committee to investigate you,

14:23.320 --> 14:25.365
you got one to discuss your declaration.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.457
All the way to election day.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.501
Even if there's only a
handful of Republicans

14:29.536 --> 14:31.544
with the grit and
spit to put up a fight,

14:31.579 --> 14:32.962
we can control the conversation.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.048
Get them talking about anything
but that goddamn article.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.842
All right. Now, who from our side

14:37.877 --> 14:39.677
- do we need to massage?
- Womack.

14:39.712 --> 14:43.055
The declaration caught him off
guard. Had to keep him out of it.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.808
It's his constituents that
actually fight the damn thing.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.686
Well, let's call in the
honorable gentleman from Missouri.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.766
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

14:57.605 --> 15:01.949
- A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- Charlie, if I may...

15:01.984 --> 15:05.077
Tom, please, what are you implying?

15:05.112 --> 15:10.041
This request for a declaration
of war is yet another distraction.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.877
And I've never been prouder of
the president than I am today.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.672
I'm not denying what happened
to the Millers. It was a tragedy.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.508
No, but you are. Because
denying it is the tragedy.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.134
This is a pattern.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.094
Your husband's
administration, Mrs. Underwood,

15:22.129 --> 15:24.632
- continues to operate in the shadows.
- Tom...

15:25.550 --> 15:28.685
I understand you believe in
the importance of your article.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.098
And I agreed to come here today
and talk with you about it.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.518
But we're fighting to
keep this country safe.

15:36.352 --> 15:41.280
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has
yet to release one piece of information

15:41.315 --> 15:45.284
about the attempted capture
of those domestic terrorists.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.911
ICO terrorists, yes.

15:46.946 --> 15:51.791
Reports from a few hours ago are
saying North Carolina or Virginia.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.126
But that's all we have.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.629
Well, we are circling
in, we're getting closer.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.255
I will tell you,

15:58.290 --> 16:01.383
our intelligence community,
they are the real heroes.

16:01.418 --> 16:04.471
Charlie, if we could get back to
my point, my sources confirmed...

16:04.506 --> 16:05.757
Tom.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.684
Heather Dunbar, no friend
of mine or my husband's,

16:09.719 --> 16:12.812
looked into these charges,
and cleared the president.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.932
Cleared? Please.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.151
The White House has not
had a single press briefing

16:19.186 --> 16:20.612
since the Herald ran my article.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.239
You keep saying the White
House isn't speaking about this.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.276
I am sitting right here talking to you.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.620
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.162
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.

16:30.197 --> 16:33.249
- What?
- Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?

16:33.284 --> 16:35.369
I'm saying, me. I'm here.

16:36.120 --> 16:41.257
And I don't know how many more
times we have to go over this.

16:41.292 --> 16:44.135
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt
article used to be

16:44.170 --> 16:47.924
the first thing I would look for
when I opened the Washington Herald.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.642
The Underwoods are
no longer campaigning.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.810
They can call it what they want.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.897
Well, if you think about the last
few days, what's in the air...

16:55.932 --> 17:00.151
It might not be such a bad idea for
us to take it one handshake at a time.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.896
Or call it for what it is.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.405
"Home and abroad."

17:04.440 --> 17:06.824
The president is essentially
asking for permission

17:06.858 --> 17:09.451
- to fight a war on our soil.
- We can't push back too hard.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.944
We can't afford to look soft on terror.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.079
We can't look the other way, either.

17:13.115 --> 17:16.501
You of all people know where
this kind of talk leads.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.329
...ICO and the United States of America.

17:20.075 --> 17:22.623
Make sure the committee dealing
with the declaration of war

17:22.625 --> 17:24.210
never gets to a vote.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.590
We're not against
war, we're against his.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.381
And I want you to
reach out to the Speaker

17:31.383 --> 17:33.304
and find out who she's
putting on that committee.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.604
We need to get back to
the president's crimes.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.183
That's the story. It's the only story.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.436
Anything else?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.071
I have my script.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.740
I will not yield!

17:47.775 --> 17:49.277
I will not...

17:58.535 --> 17:59.621
Harry...

18:01.372 --> 18:04.340
I want to know what he
says and when he says it.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.335
Our general isn't used to taking orders.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.671
Will, one more thing.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.759
- What?
- Your wife.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.935
Okay, I know we opened up
this campaign on Pollyhop,

18:15.970 --> 18:19.724
but it might be time to close it
down... or at least be more careful.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.692
Well, what did they find out?

18:22.727 --> 18:26.237
The home of the mother of the terrorist,
you know, the one they're looking for,

18:26.272 --> 18:28.030
was vandalized last night.

18:28.065 --> 18:31.367
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.535
And, uh, Hannah...

18:33.570 --> 18:36.163
well... she posted.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.284
She was defending the mother online.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.630
- When?
- This afternoon.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.250
The timing is not good on this.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.295
- I can show you.
- Not now.

18:53.716 --> 18:54.932
Thank you.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.685
Governor Conway and I
are honored to be here

18:57.720 --> 19:00.897
with the Miller family
and their closest friends.

19:00.932 --> 19:04.769
I know the VFW was a big part
of Jim's life here in Knoxville.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.612
With the help of
Homeland and our hotline,

19:07.647 --> 19:10.698
we think that Masterson has crossed
into the southwest corner of Virginia.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.568
Scott or Washington.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.113
- And?
- And...

19:17.865 --> 19:19.033
Assistant Director Green?

19:19.742 --> 19:23.502
We're relying on aerial support,
sightings and local law enforcement.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.629
But we're fairly confident

19:24.664 --> 19:27.048
we can have him pinned
down in the next 24 hours.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.508
The president wants us
to be absolutely sure.

19:29.543 --> 19:33.089
We can't have him getting away
again. Careers are at stake.

19:33.715 --> 19:37.433
Everyone around this table is fully
aware of the gravity of the situation.

19:37.468 --> 19:40.596
Good. The president will
be happy to hear that.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.054
Okay. What kind of kiss do you want?

20:57.089 --> 20:59.716
- Eskimo.
- In...

21:01.260 --> 21:02.428
and out.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.514
I'll be right back.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.651
- You're angry.
- I am.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.663
I was asked a question and I answered.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.325
That's the least of it.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.377
Okay, well, I don't want
to talk about it right now.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.213
Are you trying to lose
this election? Are you?

21:31.248 --> 21:32.924
Oh, Will, stop it.

21:32.959 --> 21:37.636
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.305
And he's still out there somewhere.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.381
- Do you understand what this looks like?
- Stop it.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.393
Do you want to know
why our son can't sleep?

21:44.428 --> 21:46.472
He's eight years old,
and he can't sleep.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.141
Because he's having nightmares.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.820
Because he thinks there's a big
black dog running around the hotel.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.154
- Dog?
- Yes.

21:55.189 --> 21:58.032
He closes his eyes, and
he can hear it growling.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.027
He's scared, Will.

22:05.116 --> 22:09.829
I said what I said because
that woman is a victim.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.289
We all are.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.750
And it has to stop.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.798
I want you to win.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.678
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.

22:42.111 --> 22:46.115
That's the mother. And
this is Hannah's response.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.667
She's not a criminal and should not
be punished for the sins of her son.

22:50.725 --> 22:53.610
We all, I know, reject the rhetoric

22:53.622 --> 22:57.008
and actions of these
damaged, troubled young men.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.177
What I mean is, this is
a time for reflection,

23:00.212 --> 23:01.262
not aggression...

23:01.297 --> 23:04.265
So she's not condoning
it, but it is sympathetic.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.017
Plays into the idea
that Joshua and Zachary

23:06.052 --> 23:08.477
were just a pair of troubled
kids looking for a cause,

23:08.512 --> 23:10.722
no different than some school shooter.

23:11.682 --> 23:14.268
The post has been shared
over 100,000 times.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.563
I want to talk with her.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.656
- Hannah?
- The mother.

23:20.691 --> 23:24.576
We've been very careful
about where you appear.

23:24.611 --> 23:27.906
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
- Of course.

23:34.788 --> 23:37.714
We need to dial up the terror.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.508
And the mother can help us with that.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.463
But that also means we
have to locate Masterson.

23:42.945 --> 23:44.238
Soon.

23:49.345 --> 23:50.972
Tom is waiting for me.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.099
Well, you go on.

24:00.982 --> 24:02.191
Francis...

24:03.900 --> 24:06.487
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.283
- No, it played beautifully.
- Not for me.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.663
Come with me.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.126
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.808
- Mr. President.
- It's all right, Officer.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.886
Ma'am.

24:33.055 --> 24:35.147
May I have your scope?

24:35.182 --> 24:38.144
Scope on your gun. I
promise I'll give it back.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.484
Thank you. Come here.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.916
Now, if you just hold the scope
a little a ways from your face...

25:01.417 --> 25:06.213
and look down, straight down,
across the lawn... right to the gate.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.679
- You see them?
- Hmm.

25:14.846 --> 25:19.310
Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.

25:19.976 --> 25:23.814
And they're looking back across the lawn,
toward this house and these windows...

25:24.981 --> 25:26.948
and they're thinking,

25:26.983 --> 25:30.821
"I wonder what the president and
the First Lady are doing tonight.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.200
And will they be able to protect us?"

25:37.328 --> 25:38.829
I should have been there.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.547
Where?

25:41.582 --> 25:45.008
When you got shot. I wish I was there.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.545
Maybe I could've...

25:47.879 --> 25:49.215
protected you.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.263
You see, all those people want...

25:57.055 --> 26:01.102
is someone to keep them from
what they're afraid to know.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.735
And what are the president and
First Lady doing tonight, Francis?

26:10.361 --> 26:12.988
Well, I believe Thomas
is waiting for you.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.033
Thank you, sir.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.519
I'll see you in the morning.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.793
Do you have a smoke?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.135
Thank you.

26:38.680 --> 26:43.059
♪ I know what my people
are thinking tonight ♪

26:44.561 --> 26:48.690
♪ As home through the
shadows they wander ♪

26:50.734 --> 26:53.237

♪ I wonder what the

27:17.678 --> 27:19.555
I've been looking for you.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.848
I got hungry.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.226
So I went down to the main kitchen.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.110
That's a lovely group of
people you have down there.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.898
If there's anything you
need, it can be brought up.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.319
I didn't know what I needed
until I was eating it.

27:34.403 --> 27:36.322
I heard the president's declaration.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.699
Very compelling.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.289
What did you really think?

27:46.039 --> 27:48.209
It was almost like the real thing.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.861
The NSA has good people. Very good.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.239
- Too good.
- Not as good as you.

28:12.274 --> 28:14.032
Good enough to find my algorithms.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.410
That doesn't mean they knew
what we were using them for.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.828
No, no.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.121
One second, they send me
home, and then the next,

28:20.156 --> 28:21.998
they tell me, "Come back!"

28:22.033 --> 28:26.044
- They'll been watching me. This is a trap.
- Or the only way out.

28:26.079 --> 28:27.379
God damn it.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.375
- You want out?
- Don't you?

28:32.669 --> 28:33.670
LeAnn...

28:36.757 --> 28:38.925
we have done some illegal things here.

28:40.344 --> 28:41.560
There are other campaigns.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.771
- If you can get into the NSA...
- That's not possible.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.940
Into their system, you can fix this.

28:46.975 --> 28:48.644
- You're not listening to me.
- I am.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.063
I know the Underwoods.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.575
The only way that we
are gonna survive this...

28:56.610 --> 28:57.861
is if they win.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.990
You can help them win.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.243
I know you can.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.341
I got on the paper right
around the time you left.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.808
Did you start in Style?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.184
Metro desk.

29:23.219 --> 29:25.479
But then I did this
piece, a street fashion,

29:25.514 --> 29:26.932
kids on the street thing.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.651
I'm surprised you asked for me.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.522
Some people are being moved
around and off the team.

29:34.440 --> 29:39.152
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"

29:43.156 --> 29:46.333
Were you ever interested
in investigative journalism?

29:46.368 --> 29:48.829
If you ask me, if it's not
investigating, it's not journalism.

29:52.874 --> 29:56.169
Word around here is you can
get anybody to talk to you.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.383
After 8:00, with a
drink in their hands...

30:02.468 --> 30:03.469
yeah.

30:12.519 --> 30:14.980
She's the one they say you called a...

30:16.982 --> 30:17.983
you know.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.329
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

30:23.364 --> 30:27.368
You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?

30:29.202 --> 30:31.204
It'd be an honor to work
with you in any capacity.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.458
To be part of this.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.388
Did you find him? Did you?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.432
It'll only be another moment.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.809
Because I've done all I can.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.472
Everything you told
me to. You know that.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.057
They know that, don't they?

30:54.770 --> 30:55.771
Mrs. Underwood.

30:57.398 --> 31:00.901
I was hoping to speak to Ms. Masterson.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.070
Just the two of us.

31:26.134 --> 31:27.553
Is there a problem?

31:28.136 --> 31:29.930
It is a bit extreme.

31:31.139 --> 31:34.107
Expanding the no-fly
list to this extent.

31:34.142 --> 31:38.274
The restrictions on visas alone is
unprecedented. How do we justify?

31:38.277 --> 31:40.021
The White House counsel's
been all through that.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.615
It's there in black and white.

31:41.650 --> 31:43.992
We're virtually closing down our borders

31:44.027 --> 31:46.828
- without any hard evidence to back it up.
- It's coming.

31:46.863 --> 31:50.081
A lot of innocent people are
trying to get into this country.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.868
They could be hurt by this.

31:54.871 --> 31:58.882
A change in policy this
big, I want it done right.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.135
I want you to let the world know

32:02.170 --> 32:05.556
that if they want to continue coming
to this country for our hospitals,

32:05.591 --> 32:09.560
our colleges, our golf courses
and God knows what else...

32:09.595 --> 32:14.057
they're going to have to deliver more
than my head on the end of a burning stick.

32:15.892 --> 32:19.277
Now look, Cathy, I know you have
well-earned relationships out there.

32:19.312 --> 32:20.446
Long-standing.

32:20.481 --> 32:23.114
I'm not holding back,
Francis. I have reached out.

32:23.149 --> 32:26.660
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.829
I want to know where ICO
is, or at the very least,

32:28.864 --> 32:30.914
that everyone's out there looking.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.373
Are we clear?

32:32.408 --> 32:33.459
We're clear.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.579
Thank you, Cathy. I know
you won't let me down.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.632
He's dead.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.391
- Is that why you're here?
- We're still looking for him...

32:50.426 --> 32:53.764
Because if he's dead, I want
to see him. To touch him.

32:56.141 --> 32:57.190
I'm trying to help...

32:57.225 --> 32:59.568
- Ms. Masterson, please.
- But he hasn't contacted me.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.147
- I wish he would.
- I understand. Calm down.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.153
He's not a monster like they all say.

33:09.530 --> 33:12.783
- I lost him somewhere.
- But he's not...

33:14.660 --> 33:17.746
But still, monsters
do exist, don't they?

33:23.209 --> 33:24.545
I want my lawyer.

33:26.630 --> 33:27.839
What for?

33:32.177 --> 33:34.185
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.723
I don't know why I say anything anymore.

33:39.059 --> 33:43.605
I wanted to see you... to
ask you a simple question.

33:44.690 --> 33:48.026
Didn't you know what was
going on in your home?

33:49.528 --> 33:51.995
- Excuse me?
- You knew...

33:52.030 --> 33:54.122
even before he went to Pakistan.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.702
- I mean, you raised him.
- No.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.081
No. He had some problems. He got lost.

34:01.748 --> 34:05.335
- But no, nothing like this.
- But you saw what he did, didn't you?

34:09.590 --> 34:11.431
- No.
- Would you like to see it?

34:11.466 --> 34:14.141
We can show it to you, if you like.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.846
No. Please don't.

34:23.895 --> 34:27.148
What he did to that
family, to that man...

34:28.190 --> 34:31.360
What sort of person
would do such a thing?

34:32.737 --> 34:35.866
He's my son.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.371
Oh, God.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.751
I know. It's awful, isn't it?

34:47.210 --> 34:49.462
Thank you.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.553
When you leave today,

34:58.263 --> 35:02.566
there will be some reporters,
some cameramen out there.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.936
But you don't need to say very much.

35:06.562 --> 35:10.233
You just need to ask
Josh to turn himself in.

35:14.696 --> 35:18.164
There are so many hardworking
mothers and fathers out there.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.243
This could've happened to any of them.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.755
We are close to capturing
your son, Ms. Masterson,

35:24.790 --> 35:27.507
and I will do my best
to have you see him.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.129
I want to go.

35:32.047 --> 35:33.674
No one's keeping you.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.529
But who did she put in? Who did
the Speaker put on the committee?

35:40.555 --> 35:42.432
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.818
We're two weeks out. It's
hard to say no to war.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.441
You and I have some things in common.

35:53.193 --> 35:56.036
- We both dislike the president.
- No. I'm still a Democrat.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.121
Who leans to the right.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.999
Alex, you do actually
lean a little to the right.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.751
Look, he's the commander in chief.

36:02.786 --> 36:05.879
He's got all the authority he
needs to fight them where they are.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.548
Well, there's one here. Out
there, right now, as we speak.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.711
Well, I'm a big fan of
American law enforcement.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.969
They'll find him soon enough.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.764
We can't just let Francis
Underwood turn us into a nation

36:15.799 --> 36:18.426
that's always looking
over their shoulder.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.858
If you can get yourself
onto that committee,

36:22.889 --> 36:26.642
I got a feeling the Chair will
give you all the time you need.

36:28.353 --> 36:31.564
My driver will take you back
to your car. But, Congressman...

36:32.812 --> 36:34.438
this is your chance.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.320
And I think you know it.

36:50.041 --> 36:53.593
Thank you so much for coming out
here. Thank you so much for coming out.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.256
Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.931
Just go away!

37:12.355 --> 37:15.531
You have no idea what is
happening in your own homes.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.361
Have you any idea where
he is, Mrs. Masterson?

37:19.070 --> 37:21.572
Josh, please...

37:22.783 --> 37:26.036
please, please turn yourself in.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.331
This has all got to stop. No, no.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.837
this after ten years with
Treasury, he was waiting for it.

38:51.872 --> 38:53.248
Yeah...

40:35.767 --> 40:38.443
Mrs. Underwood!

40:38.478 --> 40:40.403
Mrs. Underwood!

40:40.438 --> 40:43.114
Does the administration believe
that the explosion was connected

40:43.149 --> 40:46.617
- with Joshua Masterson somehow?
- We're not sure yet.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.329
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.706
The owner of the
establishment was foreign-born.

40:51.741 --> 40:54.334
Any connection to ICO overseas?

40:54.369 --> 40:58.593
I think our Deputy Director Clark
here is better equipped to answer that.

40:58.596 --> 41:01.718
We're looking into it. In the
meantime, we've set up a hotline.

41:01.721 --> 41:04.877
- If anyone in the community has any...
- And if the Republican candidate

41:04.879 --> 41:07.138
and the rest of his party
refuse to acknowledge

41:07.173 --> 41:10.016
the seriousness of the
threat made here at home...

41:10.051 --> 41:11.684
know that we will.

41:11.719 --> 41:16.314
The FBI is currently gathering
a list of words and images.

41:16.349 --> 41:20.944
If they appear on your children's
or your coworkers' devices, please...

41:20.979 --> 41:23.189
War whore!

41:24.190 --> 41:25.740
- Move!
- Car!

41:35.243 --> 41:37.662
It was just paint. She's all right.

41:39.039 --> 41:42.250
And what else? Spit it out,
Doug. It won't taste so bad.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.718
Sir, I know you
disagree with me on this.

41:45.753 --> 41:48.054
But Director Green and
his team have a location

41:48.089 --> 41:49.630
for the takedown and
they're ready to act.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.516
And they're positive
it's the right location?

41:51.551 --> 41:52.552
- Adamant.
- When?

41:53.344 --> 41:54.679
Hours.

41:58.724 --> 42:00.483
We can coordinate out
of the Situation Room.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.395
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.897
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.775
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.777
Yes, sir.

42:21.706 --> 42:24.465
It's amazing how ready
people are to be afraid.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.752
History would prove them right.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.391
You're lucky this is
coming off with water.

42:33.426 --> 42:34.635
Could've been worse.

42:35.845 --> 42:38.056
Some found its way behind your ear.

42:41.267 --> 42:44.104
- Should I be afraid?
- Don't be smart.

42:44.729 --> 42:46.189
I should, shouldn't I?

42:48.023 --> 42:49.775
I stole something from you.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.611
What?

42:54.029 --> 42:55.406
What it is, doesn't matter.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.993
I just wanted something that was yours.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.745
Well, put it back.

43:04.874 --> 43:06.334
Waterfalls.

43:06.959 --> 43:10.553
The NSA marked their zero-day
exploits as waterfalls.

43:10.588 --> 43:12.513
What can they get us into?

43:12.548 --> 43:16.976
We can backdoor into some
very popular social media.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.723
I can insert anything your imagination
can think of into those sites.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.018
Underwoods or otherwise.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.186
...reports coming in
from a variety of sources

43:27.188 --> 43:29.906
stating that local police
enforcement and FBI agents

43:29.941 --> 43:31.616
are currently on the ground.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.743
We're receiving reports
that there's a great deal

43:33.778 --> 43:35.578
of police activity on
the Virginia border.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.372
We cannot confirm at this time,

43:37.407 --> 43:39.999
but we believe this is
connected to the manhunt

43:40.034 --> 43:42.120
for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.

43:59.387 --> 44:02.272
The capture of Joshua
Masterson may be close at hand.

44:02.307 --> 44:06.359
The FBI is still not commenting,
but if you look at this aerial view,

44:06.394 --> 44:09.939
you can see heavily-armed men making
their way through this wooded area.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.557
Sir, he's not here.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.444
All we have are some
loose domestic connections.

44:49.479 --> 44:52.780
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.

44:52.815 --> 44:56.319
He refuses to confirm any
wide-ranging homegrown network.

44:57.362 --> 45:01.163
Our interrogators are confident
the asset is no longer valuable.

45:01.198 --> 45:04.076
And risk to reward no longer tenable.

45:05.995 --> 45:09.374
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.388
Did you think I didn't already have him?

45:17.423 --> 45:19.800
That I would have left
him out there somewhere?

45:20.718 --> 45:22.720
And I thought you knew me.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.086
Josh.

45:58.423 --> 45:59.882
Joshua.

46:13.563 --> 46:15.315
Do you want to live?

46:18.901 --> 46:20.695
Tell us what we want.

46:22.237 --> 46:25.199
Tell us what we want to hear.

46:27.952 --> 46:30.079
You're no martyr, are you?

46:30.955 --> 46:32.665
Look at you.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.918
No, you're not a martyr.

46:36.586 --> 46:42.425
No one will remember what you've done,
either here on Earth or in your heaven.

46:50.766 --> 46:52.977
So why did you pick the Millers?

46:56.105 --> 46:57.189
Why?

46:58.107 --> 46:59.775
What did you see?

47:04.154 --> 47:05.740
Was it the girl?

47:08.784 --> 47:10.661
Did you see her first?

47:12.538 --> 47:14.289
What did you see?

47:17.167 --> 47:20.087
Or did she see you first?

47:21.506 --> 47:25.801
Yeah, that's it, isn't it? She saw you.

47:27.553 --> 47:31.724
She looked right
through you, didn't she?

47:33.684 --> 47:36.604
I don't need to see this person anymore.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.357
- Get rid of the asset.
- Sir.

47:42.317 --> 47:45.160
He's an animal, but he's
still an American citizen.

47:45.195 --> 47:49.366
We are at war. And he
is an enemy combatant.

47:50.242 --> 47:53.252
And he lost whatever rights he
might have had as an American

47:53.287 --> 47:56.171
when he cut that poor man's head off.

47:56.206 --> 47:59.293
So don't give me your
pride or your position.

47:59.919 --> 48:01.636
Because none of this would have happened

48:01.671 --> 48:04.173
if you'd done what you were
told in the first place.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.098
I'll take care of it.

48:06.133 --> 48:09.261
Yes, you will, and you
will do so willingly.

48:11.472 --> 48:15.400
And I want you to get some
good, usable footage...

48:15.435 --> 48:16.936
of his killing.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.397
And then destroy everything else.

48:37.832 --> 48:42.462
We will be releasing footage
of Joshua Masterson's killing.

48:43.337 --> 48:45.513
The administration and
the intelligence community

48:45.548 --> 48:48.390
were hoping to take him alive.

48:48.425 --> 48:49.559
But I would like to commend

48:49.594 --> 48:52.352
Assistant Director of
Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.563
And of course all of the work

48:53.598 --> 48:56.476
that Secretary Durant has done
behind the scenes on all of this.

48:57.267 --> 49:00.736
The information the
investigation has gathered so far

49:00.771 --> 49:03.614
points to Joshua Masterson
and Zachary Hawthorne

49:03.649 --> 49:08.953
having strong connections to ICO abroad
and ICO's growing network domestically.

49:08.988 --> 49:12.658
And so I would like to
say this to ICO directly.

49:13.367 --> 49:17.037
You will not infect the mind
of one more of our young people,

49:17.580 --> 49:20.875
because I will not
stop until I find you.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.218
And I say that for the
grieving Miller family,

49:24.253 --> 49:27.638
whom I hope will find
some sleep tonight.

49:27.673 --> 49:29.724
I also urge Congress

49:29.759 --> 49:34.311
to accelerate the process and vote on
my request for a declaration of war.

49:34.346 --> 49:36.981
- Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.

49:37.016 --> 49:38.816
Seth will take it from here.

49:48.653 --> 49:51.245
It's hard to see, but I
think that was the killshot.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.873
Now, please remember, these
reports are unconfirmed

49:53.908 --> 49:56.501
and we're waiting on a
statement from the White House.

49:56.536 --> 49:59.837
- What we can report is a great deal...
- Why are you watching this?

49:59.872 --> 50:02.882
This wooded area. And shots
being fired, both by and...

50:02.917 --> 50:03.924
Hello?

50:03.959 --> 50:06.211
Hello. This is Francis Underwood.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.806
It's him.

50:10.841 --> 50:14.226
The committee is looking for
Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.

50:14.261 --> 50:16.219
What do either of them have
to do with ICO or the war?

50:16.221 --> 50:18.523
The talk up on the Hill is
they're going to invite you

50:18.558 --> 50:20.643
and the rest of your staff to testify.

50:21.526 --> 50:23.936
They're gonna use the
Declaration of War to investigate.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.105
That's right.

50:26.315 --> 50:30.367
They're gonna use the committee
Frank asked for to investigate him.

50:30.402 --> 50:31.994
- Fuck.
- That's right, Doug.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.488
"Fuck."

50:41.581 --> 50:43.021
It's difficult to underst...

50:43.958 --> 50:46.884
Well, perhaps if you could
just calm down for a moment.

50:46.919 --> 50:48.170
Please stop it.

50:48.762 --> 50:51.639
I thought this news would
bring you some relief.

50:51.674 --> 50:52.923
The president called Mrs. Miller.

50:52.925 --> 50:54.892
I promised you and your
daughter that I would...

50:54.927 --> 50:56.220
Leave her alone.

50:56.929 --> 51:00.064
Well, perhaps we should speak when
you're feeling a little more up to it.

<i>I don't want to hear
you. Or from you.</i>

- What?

51:05.520 --> 51:08.656
