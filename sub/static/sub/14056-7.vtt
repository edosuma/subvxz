00:00.234 --> 00:01.238
Previously on The O.C....

00:01.321 --> 00:02.643
Are you sure about this Julie Cooper?

00:02.697 --> 00:04.930
She's got all the right connections and nothing left to lose.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.239
- We want to throw a charity event.
- Sounds like a wonderful cause.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.415
You were just going to scam me into throwing a fake charity

00:09.473 --> 00:10.661
and leave me to pick up the pieces.

00:10.723 --> 00:11.611
What if you help me?

00:11.686 --> 00:14.190
Listen, do you mind if I join you for some pizza?

00:14.284 --> 00:15.965
Taylor, it's Summer. Open up!

00:16.047 --> 00:17.240
I can't hear you.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.474
I've been dodging this business for the last 20 years.

00:19.565 --> 00:20.528
Hang on to the company.

00:20.623 --> 00:21.446
I'll help you.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.686
This is Volcheck?

00:23.404 --> 00:24.533
Johnny?

00:26.983 --> 00:28.275
Stay away from him.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.704
Look, I'm sorry. That movie sucked.

00:32.780 --> 00:36.034
Master of the Flying Guillotine? It's a classic of the genre.

00:36.107 --> 00:38.408
It's like the Madame Bovary of martial arts cinema.

00:38.493 --> 00:40.830
Wait, the flying guillotine. Was that the spiky hat thing he threw?

00:40.903 --> 00:43.249
Yeah. Dude, I'm sorry, but that was kind of weak.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.294
Et tu, Ryan?

00:44.377 --> 00:47.672
It didn't even make sense. Why was he going after the one-armed boxer? Poor guy.

00:47.740 --> 00:49.667
Uh, revenge. It's a tale as old as time.

00:49.735 --> 00:52.292
Maybe the girls should pick the movie next time. What do you say?

00:52.374 --> 00:52.995
Yes.

00:53.081 --> 00:55.101
Do I have to remind you about the Bring It On phase?

00:55.176 --> 00:57.485
Now that is an awesome movie.

00:57.571 --> 00:59.286
I'm sexy, I'm cute

00:59.376 --> 01:00.744
I'm popular to boot

01:00.783 --> 01:02.863
I said I'm bitchin', great hair

01:02.948 --> 01:05.007
So the boys all love to stare...

01:08.018 --> 01:09.240
Dude, what'd I say?

01:09.272 --> 01:13.904
Ten to one our boys hang out at the candy-ass diner on the pier.

01:14.466 --> 01:16.619
That's want I love about you rich kids.

01:16.703 --> 01:18.801
- So predictable.
- What do you want?

01:19.327 --> 01:20.762
I got to spell it out for ya?

01:20.842 --> 01:21.963
I want a rematch.

01:22.051 --> 01:25.368
Somewhere private. Just me kicking your ass.

01:25.969 --> 01:27.462
I'm not looking for trouble.

01:28.673 --> 01:31.734
Maybe you should've thought of that before jumping me the other night.

01:31.843 --> 01:34.646
What, like you didn't start it by hooking up with someone else's girlfriend?

01:34.738 --> 01:36.034
Good point.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.965
Or that's unnecessary continuity.

01:41.308 --> 01:42.320
Either or.

01:42.472 --> 01:44.012
Look, guys, this is so stupid.

01:44.152 --> 01:45.840
I got nothing against you.

01:45.968 --> 01:47.400
Ah, that's too bad.

01:47.490 --> 01:51.322
'Cause me and you, we got unfinished business.

01:56.699 --> 01:57.892
See ya, guys.

02:34.409 --> 02:35.306
Hey, baby.

02:35.768 --> 02:36.852
I need your opinion.

02:36.967 --> 02:40.192
Which of these scream "real estate mogul with a heart of gold"?

02:40.416 --> 02:41.335
The blue.

02:41.769 --> 02:46.900
And "sensitive, street smart man of talent and mystery"?

02:48.136 --> 02:49.146
The blue.

02:49.968 --> 02:51.084
All right. Blue it is.

02:51.161 --> 02:53.674
Sandy, you're going to do great.

02:53.868 --> 02:55.696
The Newport Group's lucky to have you.

02:55.787 --> 02:58.340
Oh, I just want to make a good impression on my first day.

02:58.435 --> 03:00.290
Hey, how's that charity thing coming?

03:00.393 --> 03:01.677
Oh, it's coming.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.247
I've just never thrown together something so quickly.

03:04.368 --> 03:07.785
I hope Julie and Charlotte aren't out getting mystics while you're doing all the work.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.334
Don't worry. They're working.

03:09.434 --> 03:10.471
They're busy with the foundation.

03:10.571 --> 03:11.992
Oh, good question.

03:12.697 --> 03:13.842
Booze or no booze?

03:13.936 --> 03:15.372
Oh, tough call.

03:15.601 --> 03:18.970
A fund-raiser for poor women with substance abuse problems.

03:19.052 --> 03:21.087
I know, it's going to be weird if people are drinking.

03:21.203 --> 03:22.932
Yeah, then again, people are a lot more generous

03:22.996 --> 03:25.239
when they've got a couple of shots under their belt.

03:25.734 --> 03:26.623
Booze.

03:28.411 --> 03:29.118
Morning.

03:29.228 --> 03:30.619
Oh, hey, boys.

03:30.727 --> 03:33.595
On Sunday, I would love some help with the party.

03:33.710 --> 03:34.732
Sunday?

03:34.853 --> 03:37.726
Sunday, yeah, it's going to be tough. It's going to be tough.

03:37.831 --> 03:38.985
Yeah, no problem.

03:39.095 --> 03:40.149
Thanks, Ryan.

03:40.270 --> 03:41.323
Well, I should get going.

03:41.435 --> 03:43.263
I have to meet Charlotte and Julie at the club.

03:46.982 --> 03:50.362
Hey, what is so incredibly pressing on a Sunday?

03:50.464 --> 03:53.054
Oh, it's the Sabbath, Dad. It's a day of rest, you know?

03:53.143 --> 03:54.434
I don't make the rules.

03:54.910 --> 03:55.892
Talk to the Big Guy.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.997
I thought the Sabbath was Saturday?

03:58.089 --> 03:58.822
Listen to me.

03:58.929 --> 04:01.170
This is the first public thing your mother has done since rehab.

04:01.253 --> 04:05.301
So we are going to do everything in our power to make it a success, understood?

04:06.463 --> 04:08.995
Mom, listen, Sunday, I'm going to be there, okay?

04:09.054 --> 04:11.489
Provided I don't get struck down by lightning bolts.

04:11.526 --> 04:13.304
Thanks, Seth. That means a lot.

04:13.408 --> 04:15.168
Such generosity.

04:15.262 --> 04:16.904
Oh, there goes the back.

04:16.992 --> 04:18.019
No, I'll be all right.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.648
I'll be fine. I can probably lift stuff.

04:26.854 --> 04:28.298
I just feel responsible.

04:28.388 --> 04:30.675
I mean, if I hadn't introduced Ryan to Johnny in the first place,

04:30.758 --> 04:32.914
then he never would have gotten in a fight with that jerk.

04:32.996 --> 04:34.422
Well, if you want to blame someone why not

04:34.501 --> 04:37.229
Casey for hooking up with the surf nazi to begin with.

04:37.321 --> 04:39.264
I know. I still can't believe she did that.

04:39.351 --> 04:41.043
Um... she had a reason.

04:41.170 --> 04:41.997
Summer.

04:42.090 --> 04:43.255
I'm sorry.

04:43.668 --> 04:44.716
Have you asked him yet?

04:44.797 --> 04:47.570
Right, I'll just say, "Hey, Johnny. Casey thinks you're in love with me."

04:47.645 --> 04:49.923
And then, best case scenario, he says no.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.892
And our relationship is totally weird if not ruined.

04:53.621 --> 04:54.967
What if he is?

04:56.091 --> 04:59.590
Then our friendship is totally weird if not ruined.

05:00.079 --> 05:02.456
He hasn't done anything to make me think that.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.686
So, excuse me for not believing his psycho girlfriend.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.495
Hmm. Ex-girlfriend.

05:07.576 --> 05:08.908
Yeah, he's single now, remember?

05:09.001 --> 05:10.356
I'll see you later.

05:14.098 --> 05:17.717
Dude, all I'm saying is you just got back into Harvard, okay?

05:18.467 --> 05:21.536
You do not want to go back to the wasteland of home-schooling.

05:21.639 --> 05:23.894
And I told you, I'm not going to fight him.

05:23.992 --> 05:25.637
Yeah, I hear you and I want to believe you.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.546
But I also know Kid Chino.

05:27.659 --> 05:30.594
Sometimes when his back's up against the wall and his fists of fury...

05:30.620 --> 05:34.590
Yeah, Kid Chino is retired. He hung up the hoodie. So just relax, all right?

05:34.657 --> 05:35.575
Seth.

05:36.696 --> 05:38.672
Hey, Taylor. How's it going?

05:38.765 --> 05:42.062
It's going great. I cannot tell you how many people have come up

05:42.103 --> 05:44.082
and told me how awesome they thought lock-in was.

05:44.163 --> 05:47.688
You know what, every single one mentions Capture the Flag.

05:47.801 --> 05:49.825
Did you know he was All Camp Takahoe.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.241
He might've mentioned it.

05:51.321 --> 05:52.257
Told you it'd be fun.

05:52.382 --> 05:55.222
It was. It was. And it was all because of you, too.

05:55.317 --> 05:58.213
He took the lead in everything. I mean with the trust falls

05:58.294 --> 06:00.571
and the s'more making and share time.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.506
Your story about Captain Oats.

06:02.584 --> 06:06.270
Ah, yeah, we had to tell a story about our best friend growing up.

06:06.353 --> 06:08.993
And it was so insensitive of those guys to laugh, too.

06:09.072 --> 06:13.140
'Cause your story wasn't nearly as lame as Derrick Simmons befriending the deaf kid.

06:13.557 --> 06:17.261
But Seth, I wanted to ask you, um,

06:17.335 --> 06:20.228
what do you think about planning the Christmas dance together?

06:20.430 --> 06:22.253
The Christmas dance? You and me?

06:22.351 --> 06:24.465
We made such a good team.

06:25.358 --> 06:28.782
Oh, wow, yeah. Well, that... you should talk to Summer.

06:30.312 --> 06:31.654
Your girlfriend?

06:34.442 --> 06:35.121
Summer?

06:35.227 --> 06:38.294
Yeah, because did like a fantastic job at the last one.

06:38.386 --> 06:40.621
And I just think that you guys would, would...

06:40.886 --> 06:44.341
There she is right over there. You can talk to her about it yourself.

06:44.422 --> 06:45.485
Okay, forget it.

06:45.569 --> 06:46.635
I got to go.

06:47.369 --> 06:49.494
Ooh, boy, you're in trouble.

06:49.582 --> 06:50.484
What? What do you mean?

06:50.570 --> 06:51.248
You're in trouble.

06:51.329 --> 06:53.679
That? I mean, I was nice to her. So that's what that's about.

06:53.759 --> 06:55.721
You keep telling yourself that, yeah.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.103
Hey.

06:57.261 --> 06:58.583
What were you doing talking to her?

06:58.660 --> 07:00.477
Did you forget that she didn't let me into the lock-in?

07:00.548 --> 07:02.765
I totally bruised my hand pounding on that door.

07:02.843 --> 07:03.958
She probably didn't know it was you.

07:04.047 --> 07:06.782
No, she knew it was me. She just didn't want to let me in.

07:06.871 --> 07:07.828
I wonder why.

07:08.942 --> 07:10.987
What... what's that supposed to mean?

07:12.383 --> 07:15.071
We should take out half these tables so we can have more flow.

07:15.164 --> 07:16.923
We should also talk to them about the music.

07:17.014 --> 07:19.582
The last event I did here, they had us on a Kenny G loop.

07:19.653 --> 07:21.190
Can I just tell you how excited I am?

07:21.287 --> 07:22.848
This is going to be so wonderful.

07:22.922 --> 07:24.937
I'm so glad you suggested it.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.364
Oh, there's a manager.

07:27.441 --> 07:30.548
I'm going to find out what time we can be here on Sunday and set up.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.321
So, where are we?

07:33.413 --> 07:36.027
130 RSVPs at $5,000 a head.

07:36.112 --> 07:39.274
That's over $600,000.

07:41.552 --> 07:43.162
$300,000 apiece.

07:46.261 --> 07:48.635
Tell me again I have to do this.

07:49.035 --> 07:52.484
Julie, you have two daughters, no husband and no money.

07:52.571 --> 07:55.638
You're about to get $300,000.

07:56.433 --> 07:57.358
Oh, yeah.

07:57.503 --> 07:59.347
I'm totally doing this.

07:59.907 --> 08:01.837
He says we can be here at 8:00.

08:04.259 --> 08:06.408
- Ryan. Hi.
- Hi.

08:06.497 --> 08:07.433
Going this way?

08:07.691 --> 08:08.611
Yeah.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.163
So, you're like Seth's best friend, right?

08:12.265 --> 08:13.461
Don't tell Captain Oats.

08:13.565 --> 08:15.903
That's funny. I didn't know that you were funny.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.164
So, Seth and Summer seem happy.

08:18.246 --> 08:22.190
I mean, I know they had that trouble last year, but, um, they seem stable.

08:22.268 --> 08:23.585
Wouldn't you say that they're stable?

08:23.682 --> 08:27.921
Of course, though, I mean, look at Brad and Jen. Everybody thought that they were stable.

08:28.024 --> 08:30.641
But nobody knew how unhappy Brad was.

08:30.726 --> 08:33.158
That he was just waiting for Angelina to come rescue him.

08:33.245 --> 08:33.695
They're stable.

08:33.775 --> 08:35.524
How stable? One to ten.

08:35.623 --> 08:36.856
Uh, excuse me?

08:36.950 --> 08:38.236
On a scale of one to ten.

08:38.321 --> 08:38.669
Right?

08:38.749 --> 08:39.807
How stable are they?

08:39.899 --> 08:40.961
Six?

08:41.240 --> 08:42.581
6.5?

08:42.828 --> 08:43.743
Ten.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.768
Ten, uh-huh.

08:46.237 --> 08:47.739
Sucks for Angelina.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.060
Then again...

08:50.591 --> 08:52.748
things happen, don't they?

08:53.384 --> 08:55.794
I bet Brad and Jen used to be a ten.

08:56.862 --> 08:57.874
Bye.

09:00.405 --> 09:02.337
I wanted to welcome you all on our first day.

09:02.418 --> 09:03.930
Matt, have you had a chance to meet everyone?

09:04.021 --> 09:04.619
Not yet.

09:04.726 --> 09:05.579
Matt Ramsey.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.311
I wanted to go over what's changed.

09:08.412 --> 09:12.348
The Newport Group will still develop residential and commercial properties.

09:12.443 --> 09:13.807
With this alteration--

09:13.929 --> 09:18.148
one quarter of our new housing projects will be low income.

09:18.248 --> 09:21.229
We are not just catering to the mansion crowd anymore.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.163
Although we do need their money to stay in business.

09:23.256 --> 09:25.105
And the other thing that's changed is us.

09:25.213 --> 09:27.884
Matt will be a Vice President and Director of Development,

09:27.980 --> 09:30.372
which will leave me as President and CEO.

09:30.457 --> 09:32.462
And despite the fact that I've watched my lovely wife

09:32.537 --> 09:35.025
do this job for the past 15 years,

09:35.103 --> 09:36.142
I'm new at this.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.817
And I'm going to need your help.

09:43.306 --> 09:45.976
Well, stop milling around and get back to work.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.194
Thank you everybody.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.053
Nice speech.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.129
That's nothing.

09:54.236 --> 09:55.989
Catch me with a microphone in my hand.

09:56.085 --> 09:57.515
You should try to meet everyone.

09:57.588 --> 09:59.395
- They'd appreciate it. 
- Oh, yeah.

09:59.519 --> 10:02.609
Hi. Matt Ramsey. Good to meet you.

10:02.808 --> 10:03.766
You're fired.

10:03.898 --> 10:06.529
So I take it your meeting with the accountant yesterday didn't go so well.

10:06.611 --> 10:09.965
The word "unsustainable" was used a lot.

10:10.071 --> 10:11.400
We have to lose nine people.

10:11.483 --> 10:12.292
Nine?

10:12.390 --> 10:13.664
That's a little extreme.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.330
Well, you have to look at the numbers.

10:15.403 --> 10:16.509
For now, we sit tight.

10:16.589 --> 10:17.822
We're here one day.

10:17.915 --> 10:21.544
The first order of business is not going to be firing half the staff.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.328
Well, you're the boss.

10:24.861 --> 10:27.143
I have a meeting about the zoning on Crestmont.

10:27.215 --> 10:28.761
Let me know what you come up with.

10:30.866 --> 10:33.043
I'm only telling you so you can be on the lookout, okay?

10:33.123 --> 10:34.571
'Cause this guy is crazy.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.436
Gotcha. I'll be on Amber alert.

10:36.573 --> 10:38.489
Oh, and don't tell Johnny. He might do something stupid.

10:38.557 --> 10:40.756
Hey, say no more. It'll be our little secret.

10:40.833 --> 10:41.408
Okay.

10:41.486 --> 10:43.848
And if maybe sharing that secret maybe brings us closer together,

10:43.922 --> 10:45.681
creates a bond, we'll roll with that, too.

10:45.769 --> 10:47.456
Uh-huh. Just don't tell Johnny, okay?

10:47.546 --> 10:49.309
- Tell me what?
- Johnny.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.436
Hey! How are ya?

10:51.969 --> 10:53.661
I'm good. Tell me what?

10:53.757 --> 10:57.747
Um, no offense, man. This is kind of just between me and Marissa.

10:58.737 --> 11:00.261
It's Volcheck, isn't it?

11:00.418 --> 11:02.005
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

11:02.103 --> 11:03.011
Chili?

11:04.991 --> 11:07.393
Come on, man, you guys are tearing me apart here.

11:07.483 --> 11:11.206
Okay, look, he tried to get Ryan to fight him. But nothing happened so...

11:11.351 --> 11:12.583
Ugh, hold these.

11:12.703 --> 11:14.351
Johnny, wait.

11:15.429 --> 11:16.262
Johnny.

11:16.370 --> 11:17.570
Look, this isn't Ryan's fight.

11:17.654 --> 11:18.559
So what are you gonna do?

11:18.631 --> 11:20.934
Go knock on this guy's door and say "Hey, fight me" instead?

11:20.999 --> 11:23.847
I'm not gonna sit back and let your boyfriend take the heat for my problem.

11:23.914 --> 11:26.032
I'm not letting either of you guys get in a fight.

11:26.114 --> 11:27.069
Marissa, that's not the point.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.403
What is it with you two?

11:28.490 --> 11:29.678
I'm so sick of this.

11:29.762 --> 11:31.219
Ryan has nothing to do with this.

11:31.294 --> 11:33.328
You know what? It's fine. Whatever. Just do whatever you want.

11:33.398 --> 11:34.243
Hey!

11:36.754 --> 11:38.061
Okay.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.827
I won't fight him.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.513
Seriously?

11:42.830 --> 11:44.594
Fighting a guy's one thing.

11:44.820 --> 11:48.350
When it comes to upsetting a lady, I'm a total coward.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.136
You win.

11:54.786 --> 11:56.571
Look, we'd better get to class.

11:57.903 --> 12:00.673
I'm serious. Do you have any idea what Summer will do if she finds out?

12:00.761 --> 12:01.877
Yeah, I can imagine.

12:02.050 --> 12:04.168
I have to tell Taylor it's not gonna happen.

12:04.527 --> 12:06.421
Even if I didn't love Summer,

12:07.103 --> 12:11.187
her and I were totally incompatible, seeing as how she's crazy and I'm not.

12:11.276 --> 12:13.079
Well, I thought you said she wasn't that bad.

12:13.165 --> 12:14.465
- Taylor Townsend?
- Yeah.

12:14.547 --> 12:18.091
In fourth grade she campaigned against making the school handicapped accessible.

12:18.279 --> 12:22.007
She said it was reverse Darwinism. Besides, who...

12:22.204 --> 12:25.042
who wants Dean Hess's seconds?

12:26.321 --> 12:29.056
Oh, look. There's a picnic on our car.

12:30.235 --> 12:31.724
Hmm, it's you guys.

12:31.888 --> 12:33.000
Finally.

12:33.715 --> 12:34.875
Seth, get security.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.838
Yeah, well, maybe we'll go get them together.

12:36.878 --> 12:38.070
Mm, security?

12:38.381 --> 12:39.528
We're just talking.

12:39.617 --> 12:40.903
I mean, nothing's gonna hap...

12:41.745 --> 12:42.462
Oh...

12:42.543 --> 12:44.279
It's all right. It's just a little soap and...

12:44.361 --> 12:45.661
I'm not gonna fight you.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.261
Did you hear that?

12:47.419 --> 12:49.578
Rich boy doesn't want to get his hands dirty.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.400
Is your butler around? Maybe he'll fight me.

12:51.412 --> 12:52.068
I got it.

12:52.147 --> 12:55.861
We're all strangers. Okay, so let's take a step back for a second.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.891
I'm Seth. I like comic books.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.677
You obviously like, uh, flaming heart tattoos.

13:03.141 --> 13:04.782
I think you do got it in you.

13:05.019 --> 13:07.961
In fact, I think you're just itching to throw down.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.410
I just gotta find the key.

13:10.512 --> 13:14.101
Uh, uh, oh, look what I found.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.736
You know what I just realized, though?

13:26.824 --> 13:28.070
She doesn't have a name.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.989
I'm gonna call her Little Bitch.

13:39.925 --> 13:41.126
Just keep walking.

13:41.604 --> 13:42.818
This ain't over.

13:48.183 --> 13:49.038
Hi.

13:49.369 --> 13:49.999
Hey.

13:50.284 --> 13:52.016
We having breakfast this morning?

13:52.461 --> 13:55.112
So, Summer told me what happened yesterday with Volcheck.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.092
Ah, yes. Seth kept a secret a whole 12 hours. Must be a record.

13:59.183 --> 14:02.026
Yeah, you know, it's... I didn't want to worry you.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.849
Well, I'm proud of you for not fighting.

14:03.931 --> 14:04.884
I know it must have been hard.

14:04.971 --> 14:06.420
Yeah, you have no idea.

14:06.641 --> 14:08.328
That guy's a total jackass.

14:08.639 --> 14:09.687
What are you doing?

14:10.251 --> 14:12.133
What are all these tools for?

14:12.338 --> 14:14.361
You want to see? Come on.

14:14.784 --> 14:16.119
Just don't overreact.

14:18.508 --> 14:19.305
A punching bag.

14:19.396 --> 14:21.698
Yeah, Sandy had it in the garage. Said I could use it.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.615
So you could train to fight him?

14:23.698 --> 14:24.886
No, I'm not gonna fight him.

14:24.969 --> 14:26.013
I didn't yesterday, remember?

14:26.100 --> 14:27.356
Then what's it for?

14:28.814 --> 14:29.956
Therapy.

14:30.816 --> 14:33.335
Okay. I just don't want any more fighting.

14:33.450 --> 14:35.543
Johnny wanted to go after Volcheck again.

14:35.634 --> 14:37.042
But I talked him out of it.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.229
How's he doing?

14:38.351 --> 14:40.002
You mean about Casey?

14:40.348 --> 14:42.237
Well, she really hurt him.

14:42.350 --> 14:45.477
Well, Seth's going to the Bait Shop tonight. Why don't you invite Johnny?

14:45.550 --> 14:46.737
Take his mind off things.

14:46.824 --> 14:47.843
Sure.

14:49.826 --> 14:51.080
Now what about breakfast?

14:51.157 --> 14:51.937
Definitely. Definitely.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.207
I'll meet you inside. I gotta clean up.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.472
- Okay.
- All right.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.694
You can't deliver at 4:00. By the time the guests arrive, they'll be pudding.

15:19.770 --> 15:21.210
And I can't have pudding.

15:22.949 --> 15:24.309
Six will be fine.

15:24.638 --> 15:25.573
Thank you.

15:25.689 --> 15:27.259
Ah, sweet charity.

15:27.356 --> 15:29.955
I am here by calling the next three hours Kirsten time.

15:30.039 --> 15:32.356
I am going to the gym, I am getting my nails done

15:32.435 --> 15:34.859
and everything else can wait.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.301
Good for you.

15:36.396 --> 15:37.735
You left early this morning?

15:38.825 --> 15:42.894
Yeah. You know, nothing like a little dawn patrol to clear your head.

15:42.978 --> 15:44.377
Is everything okay?

15:44.463 --> 15:46.817
I was so busy yesterday, I forgot to ask how your first day went.

15:46.911 --> 15:49.885
Oh, it's good. It's good. It's uh, you know, just a...

15:50.107 --> 15:51.105
just a lot.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.882
Well, you can always come to me with questions.

15:52.964 --> 15:53.863
Thanks.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.803
You go have your Kirsten time.

16:01.084 --> 16:02.110
Come in.

16:04.679 --> 16:05.860
Hi Seth.

16:07.102 --> 16:08.933
Taylor, hey. What are, what are you doing here?

16:08.999 --> 16:10.221
Oh, your Mom let me in.

16:10.314 --> 16:12.546
She seems really, really nice.

16:13.817 --> 16:15.823
Wow, your room is really cute.

16:15.925 --> 16:16.808
Look, can we talk?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.185
Yeah, okay, but before you say anything...

16:18.260 --> 16:20.019
- I like you.
- Ah, boy.

16:20.737 --> 16:25.507
I know. It totally surprised me, too, because I don't usually go for the R. Crumb type,

16:25.572 --> 16:27.943
but the heart has its own magic.

16:27.957 --> 16:30.007
Um... um... yeah.

16:30.093 --> 16:31.672
Well, I'm with Summer, though, so--

16:31.759 --> 16:33.010
I heard you were breaking up.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.235
What? Who said that?

16:34.322 --> 16:35.138
I made it up.

16:35.233 --> 16:38.194
But what did you feel when you heard it? Relief?

16:38.276 --> 16:39.197
No.

16:39.492 --> 16:42.382
Listen, Taylor, even if I was single, uh...

16:42.476 --> 16:44.715
I'm not so sure that you and I would make a great match. I mean...

16:44.765 --> 16:46.551
Is that a Yakuza Prep poster?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.870
Yeah, it's just this Japanese film about these prep school kids...

16:50.952 --> 16:54.423
Yeah, yeah. It's like my favorite movie of all time!

16:54.515 --> 16:56.918
I think Kenji Yamamoto was a genius.

16:57.005 --> 16:57.882
- Really?
- Yes!

16:57.957 --> 16:59.288
Have you seen his samurai assassination series?

16:59.369 --> 17:01.629
Battles on the Edge of Hell? I own the criterion collection.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.225
Oh, my God. You like comic books?

17:03.311 --> 17:05.169
Comics are geek wacky material.

17:05.396 --> 17:09.501
But, look, Seth. I mean it's obvious that we are soul mates.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.279
All you have to do is break up with Summer.

17:12.516 --> 17:15.917
Right, well, I'm not gonna be able to do that, so...

17:16.977 --> 17:18.098
I see.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.027
Excuse me.

17:25.492 --> 17:26.222
Hello?

17:26.310 --> 17:28.561
Hey, what time do we have to be there tonight?

17:28.660 --> 17:32.130
Yeah, I think we should be at the Bait Shop by, like, 8:00.

17:32.594 --> 17:34.043
I'll see you later, Seth.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.713
Who was that? That sounded like a girl.

17:37.801 --> 17:40.703
Did it? But yeah. Well, sure.

17:40.779 --> 17:43.510
Because I'm listening to the radio and This American Life is on

17:43.579 --> 17:45.693
and so, it was a girl talking.

17:45.789 --> 17:48.354
Oh, is that that show by those hipster know-it-alls

17:48.411 --> 17:50.657
who talk about how fascinating ordinary people are?

17:50.727 --> 17:51.515
Ugh, God!

17:51.590 --> 17:53.391
Uh-huh, yeah.

17:55.613 --> 17:56.671
Did you get the tickets?

17:56.805 --> 17:59.324
Yep, San Juan, Puerto Rico,

17:59.424 --> 18:01.723
where your ill-gotten dollar goes farther.

18:01.809 --> 18:02.835
How's your roomie holding up?

18:02.912 --> 18:05.603
Well, she still thinks she's getting half the money and a free condo.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.658
Wow.

18:06.763 --> 18:08.267
You almost feel bad for her.

18:08.363 --> 18:09.610
Yeah, almost.

18:09.736 --> 18:10.911
I'll see you tomorrow night.

18:11.267 --> 18:12.774
I just don't think we should sign.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.083
Hey, what's the problem?

18:14.182 --> 18:16.589
Oh, they want us to sign a liability agreement.

18:16.681 --> 18:18.459
But then you'd be responsible.

18:18.757 --> 18:19.565
I'm happy to do it.

18:19.638 --> 18:20.498
What could happen?

18:20.592 --> 18:21.641
Exactly.

18:23.521 --> 18:25.010
There, it's done.

18:25.131 --> 18:26.575
I'm gonna give this to a manager.

18:31.495 --> 18:34.010
It's as if somebody steps a toe. It doesn't mean anything.

18:34.561 --> 18:37.419
I know. I'm just... nervous.

18:37.497 --> 18:39.926
Look, as soon as I skip town, everybody is gonna blame me.

18:40.006 --> 18:40.681
You're gonna be fine.

18:40.781 --> 18:42.366
What about Kirsten?

18:42.883 --> 18:45.286
Well, she's gonna be very hurt.

18:45.376 --> 18:47.675
And she's gonna need her best friend.

18:48.850 --> 18:49.813
Right.

19:00.159 --> 19:01.173
You wanted to see me?

19:01.287 --> 19:02.228
Yeah.

19:02.351 --> 19:05.690
I spent the morning with our accountant going over the numbers and you're right.

19:05.782 --> 19:09.938
In order for this company to be as strong as possible, we have to lose nine people.

19:10.031 --> 19:11.305
For once, I wish I was wrong.

19:11.391 --> 19:12.876
But I'm still not doing it.

19:13.873 --> 19:15.346
I came up with a plan.

19:15.795 --> 19:20.799
We restructure our loans, eliminate the perks, cut my salary by 30 percent.

19:21.057 --> 19:23.920
We let four people go, it'll get us by.

19:24.022 --> 19:25.862
But this-this leaves us no margin.

19:25.948 --> 19:27.146
If one deal goes down...

19:27.249 --> 19:28.483
Then we go down.

19:28.987 --> 19:32.340
But as long as I'm running this company, that's how we're gonna do it.

20:05.945 --> 20:08.691
Hey, it was not a pity invite. Okay?

20:09.613 --> 20:10.473
Tell him.

20:11.548 --> 20:14.905
Yeah, no. We, uh, we thought you might like to see the band.

20:15.229 --> 20:20.442
Well, so you weren't worried I'd be home alone all weekend thinking about Casey?

20:20.557 --> 20:21.917
- No.
- That's crazy.

20:22.001 --> 20:23.919
No. No, but seriously what are you doing tomorrow

20:23.995 --> 20:25.665
because my mom's having a fun d-raising.

20:25.759 --> 20:28.056
Yeah, if you want, Seth and I could use your help.

20:28.119 --> 20:31.007
Yeah, well, they're counting on Seth. They definitely need your help.

20:31.319 --> 20:34.600
Well, you guys are so not subtle.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.393
I appreciate it.

20:39.195 --> 20:40.267
Thanks.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.561
Hey. Hey, buddy...

20:45.868 --> 20:47.718
I used to work here.

20:48.513 --> 20:49.467
Hello, Seth.

20:51.199 --> 20:53.396
Taylor. Hey!

20:53.982 --> 20:55.371
Is Summer here?

20:55.566 --> 20:58.743
Okay, look, I love Summer. I always have.

20:58.814 --> 21:03.428
Now, while you and I may share an appreciation for ultra-violent ancient cinema,

21:03.519 --> 21:04.706
there's no way...

21:04.799 --> 21:05.773
What's going on?

21:07.647 --> 21:09.172
Tell me you just heard what I was saying.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.133
Hi, Summer.

21:10.243 --> 21:11.278
You look really cute.

21:11.372 --> 21:15.630
I know. But more importantly, why are you always talking to my boyfriend?

21:17.936 --> 21:19.840
She likes Yakuza...

21:19.901 --> 21:20.964
Never mind.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.065
Well, maybe I should just get going.

21:23.687 --> 21:26.343
Oh, oh, um, I almost forgot.

21:26.846 --> 21:27.670
Here.

21:29.584 --> 21:31.565
Thanks for letting me borrow him.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.471
It really means a lot to me that you trust me.

21:38.804 --> 21:39.741
Bye.

21:41.915 --> 21:43.615
You let her borrow Captain Oats?!

21:43.704 --> 21:44.705
I didn't let her borrow anything.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.350
She must have taken it from me when she was in my room.

21:46.441 --> 21:48.052
When was she in your room?!

21:49.120 --> 21:50.930
That was her when I was on the phone?

21:52.067 --> 21:53.984
Something happened at the lock-in.

21:55.963 --> 21:57.358
You're such a jerk!

21:57.456 --> 21:58.328
Summer...

21:58.699 --> 21:59.751
Summer?

22:27.878 --> 22:29.264
Leaving already, bro?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.079
Harper, what's up?

22:33.505 --> 22:34.943
How's your girlfriend doing?

22:35.071 --> 22:37.153
No, don't. He's not worth it.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.086
Get out of the way, man.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.397
Or what?

22:42.325 --> 22:44.276
You're not going to fight me, I know that.

22:44.383 --> 22:45.993
But she might shoot you.

22:46.097 --> 22:47.263
She has before.

22:47.372 --> 22:49.435
- Yeah.
- Is that true, bro?

22:49.598 --> 22:51.768
You let your girlfriend do your fighting for you?

22:53.369 --> 22:54.080
Hold up, girl.

22:58.273 --> 22:59.751
Don't you touch her.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.489
So that's what gets you going.

23:03.707 --> 23:05.796
You, out!

23:25.999 --> 23:26.917
Hey.

23:27.290 --> 23:28.151
Hi.

23:29.124 --> 23:31.106
Hey, Kirsten's already over at the yacht club.

23:31.177 --> 23:32.942
Once you and Mr. Sabbath have breakfast,

23:33.009 --> 23:34.801
we should head over there and start setting up.

23:34.892 --> 23:37.043
Great. Can I talk to you about something?

23:38.253 --> 23:39.388
Any time.

23:40.017 --> 23:44.062
There's this guy, and he's gotten it in his head that he's going to fight me.

23:45.169 --> 23:49.291
Does this have anything to do with the fact that my car is now the "Little Bitch"?

23:49.396 --> 23:50.736
Maybe. I was going to fix that.

23:50.843 --> 23:51.999
Forget about it.

23:52.109 --> 23:53.796
That there's enough to go to the cops.

23:53.912 --> 23:54.740
Yeah.

23:54.845 --> 23:55.902
Do you want me to talk to him?

23:56.019 --> 23:59.547
No. No offense, but I don't see this guy getting scared.

24:01.109 --> 24:02.638
You know you can't get into another fight.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.072
No, I know. And I've been trying to walk away.

24:05.187 --> 24:07.881
You're using your brains instead of your fists, good.

24:07.903 --> 24:10.327
But, I mean, how does it help me with this guy?

24:10.432 --> 24:11.939
You got to keep walking away,

24:12.036 --> 24:13.931
'cause whatever's making him angry,

24:14.217 --> 24:15.512
it isn't you.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.028
Oh, hang on just a minute.

24:21.662 --> 24:24.455
Hey, Matt. It's a little early on a Sunday morning.

24:26.871 --> 24:28.143
Today?

24:29.148 --> 24:31.838
No, you don't do anything till I get there.

24:33.114 --> 24:34.036
All right.

24:36.026 --> 24:39.098
You and Seth are going to have to go to the club without me. I'll catch up later.

24:39.983 --> 24:41.957
I'll have my phone if you need me.

24:42.362 --> 24:43.838
I can't believe you dragged me out of bed for this.

24:43.926 --> 24:45.621
This is the worst idea ever.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.245
There's no other way.

24:47.414 --> 24:49.118
Okay, but seriously, you don't know Volchek.

24:49.195 --> 24:50.851
Last year, some guy snaked his wave,

24:50.929 --> 24:53.650
so he went up on the pier and dropped a kitchen sink on him.

24:54.347 --> 24:56.078
Where do you even get a kitchen sink?

24:56.808 --> 24:59.439
Yeah, well, if you're so concerned, why don't you stay in the car?

25:00.670 --> 25:03.413
I'm just saying maybe we could bring some muscle

25:03.496 --> 25:05.273
besides the muscle that I already provided.

25:05.355 --> 25:07.117
Yo, yo, yo, check it out.

25:07.826 --> 25:10.062
Oh, hey, look who's here.

25:10.206 --> 25:11.339
Now, don't shoot.

25:13.251 --> 25:14.285
Hey, dork.

25:14.679 --> 25:15.240
Hey.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.455
Look, I want you to leave Ryan alone.

25:18.157 --> 25:19.779
Oh, so it's bribes now?

25:20.348 --> 25:22.304
Well, I got a watch;

25:22.400 --> 25:24.015
K-Mart, $15.99.

25:24.097 --> 25:27.191
Well, this is Cartier, and I got it for my 16th birthday.

25:27.414 --> 25:29.237
It's worth, like four grand.

25:30.146 --> 25:34.895
Damn, you must really think I might hurt him.

25:34.981 --> 25:36.289
Do we have a deal?

25:37.785 --> 25:40.501
Sure. I'll leave your little boy alone.

25:40.592 --> 25:41.460
All right.

25:42.405 --> 25:45.253
If I see you around again, I'm going to tell the cops you stole that.

25:45.974 --> 25:47.201
You do that.

25:49.900 --> 25:53.000
Don't put them in direct sunlight because when the water starts to heat up,

25:53.072 --> 25:55.524
then the flowers, they, they wilt.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.732
Do you, do you think there's too much red?

25:58.407 --> 25:59.423
Hey, Kirsten.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.254
Oh, hey.

26:00.352 --> 26:01.068
What's up?

26:01.170 --> 26:03.040
Just giving final instruction.

26:03.126 --> 26:07.341
Oh, I know I'm going a little crazy, but I just want everything to be perfect.

26:07.430 --> 26:08.419
It will be, won't it?

26:08.508 --> 26:11.049
Yeah, of course. It'll be fantastic.

26:11.148 --> 26:12.222
Thanks, Julie.

26:12.343 --> 26:14.434
I am so glad we're doing this together.

26:14.705 --> 26:15.738
Me, too.

26:22.053 --> 26:23.114
What the hell are you doing?

26:23.195 --> 26:23.951
Let me explain.

26:24.054 --> 26:25.552
Forget going behind my back.

26:25.632 --> 26:27.923
You called people in on a Sunday to fire them.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.067
Is that what they teach you in business school so you don't lose time during the week?

26:31.153 --> 26:33.698
Listen, I just thought it'd be better now than on Monday

26:33.780 --> 26:36.353
when they have to face the humiliation of packing up in front of their co-workers.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.712
And I didn't go behind your back.

26:37.794 --> 26:38.423
Really?

26:38.525 --> 26:41.120
Because as much as I appreciate the heads-up phone call

26:41.194 --> 26:43.096
that you're about to fire four of our employees,

26:43.175 --> 26:44.596
I don't recall every agreeing to this.

26:44.664 --> 26:46.730
We agreed we had to let them go.

26:47.555 --> 26:50.907
I just thought that if I did it myself, I would spare you the pain, that's all.

26:50.985 --> 26:54.547
For the record, I don't let people do my dirty work for me.

26:56.292 --> 26:57.668
Where are they?

26:57.928 --> 26:59.194
They're in your office.

27:04.417 --> 27:05.475
Sandy...

27:05.610 --> 27:07.350
It's all right, Matt.

27:07.644 --> 27:08.741
Now go home.

27:08.855 --> 27:10.150
It's Sunday.

27:19.239 --> 27:20.391
Listen to me.

27:20.521 --> 27:22.176
Nothing happened at the lock-in.

27:22.192 --> 27:24.933
Uh-huh, and yet you still felt the need to lie about her being in your room?

27:25.033 --> 27:26.747
Because I knew how you'd react.

27:26.864 --> 27:30.399
Not that it's your fault. I'm saying it's my fault. It's definitely my fault.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.704
You know what is my fault?

27:31.806 --> 27:32.506
What?

27:32.606 --> 27:33.597
That!

27:33.702 --> 27:34.818
Ow!

27:35.770 --> 27:38.581
Listen, man, I'm really sorry about this whole Volchek thing.

27:38.749 --> 27:40.026
Ah, it's not your fault.

27:40.128 --> 27:42.133
Guys like Volchek are looking for any excuse.

27:42.227 --> 27:43.816
Sounds like you've been in this situation before.

27:43.918 --> 27:45.741
Ah, it feels like every week.

27:46.970 --> 27:51.337
Look, if anything goes down, I'm there.

27:51.957 --> 27:55.041
Well, thanks, but I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.

27:55.231 --> 27:56.973
Sometimes you don't have a choice.

28:05.797 --> 28:07.219
Julie, you're not dressed.

28:07.298 --> 28:08.877
We need to leave in a few minutes.

28:09.405 --> 28:11.195
I don't think I can do this.

28:16.835 --> 28:18.666
You're worried about Kirsten getting hurt.

28:19.534 --> 28:21.812
Kirsten, Marissa.

28:22.655 --> 28:24.238
Even if they blame you.

28:26.098 --> 28:27.259
I see.

28:27.912 --> 28:29.622
Well, what if they blame you?

28:30.516 --> 28:31.353
What?

28:31.455 --> 28:33.673
What if I call the police and tell them how we created

28:33.763 --> 28:36.407
a fake charity to defraud your friends.

28:36.550 --> 28:38.067
Charlotte, they'd arrest you.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.706
Yeah, they have to find me first.

28:39.751 --> 28:42.335
Plus, I think you might be a little easier to track down.

28:48.064 --> 28:50.219
Could you do jail, Julie?

28:50.706 --> 28:52.240
And if you did, which one of your former friends

28:52.318 --> 28:54.471
would be there to help you when you get out?

28:57.455 --> 29:00.284
Now get dressed.

29:00.938 --> 29:02.668
We don't want to be late for the party.

29:05.423 --> 29:06.711
Do you think Taylor's pretty?

29:06.797 --> 29:07.489
Summer...

29:07.560 --> 29:10.744
Well, I mean, I know she's not prettier than me, but, like, objectively speaking.

29:10.819 --> 29:13.990
Objectively speaking, I think Seth loves you, and you've got nothing to worry about.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.380
Go put these on the table.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.233
He told me to give you this.

29:21.322 --> 29:22.395
He changed his mind.

29:22.490 --> 29:23.387
He wants cash.

29:23.473 --> 29:24.444
But he can sell that.

29:24.538 --> 29:26.675
Tell him yourself. He's in the parking lot.

29:33.669 --> 29:34.849
We had a deal.

29:35.194 --> 29:37.635
Pawnshop ain't open. I need cash now.

29:37.715 --> 29:38.948
I owe a guy some money.

29:39.039 --> 29:40.866
Well, I don't have $4,000.

29:40.970 --> 29:43.436
Lucky for you all I need is a couple hundred.

29:43.580 --> 29:46.069
Come on. You got an ATM card, don't you?

29:47.004 --> 29:50.072
Screw it. Your boyfriend inside, hmm?

29:50.179 --> 29:51.025
Okay.

29:51.131 --> 29:52.359
Fine, I'll go.

29:54.203 --> 29:55.124
Let's go.

30:03.925 --> 30:06.177
I am so glad that you both could come.

30:06.195 --> 30:08.506
But you know what? You should watch those ahi rolls, Chuck,

30:08.580 --> 30:10.586
or we'll be treating you for substance abuse.

30:10.913 --> 30:12.311
Oh, excuse me.

30:12.463 --> 30:13.418
Nice to see you.

30:15.290 --> 30:17.049
Well, you don't miss a beat.

30:17.143 --> 30:19.967
Oh, well, you know, just like riding a bike.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.070
Julie, I really want to thank you.

30:23.690 --> 30:24.837
For what?

30:25.167 --> 30:26.693
Making me do this.

30:27.649 --> 30:29.939
I wasn't sure that I was ready.

30:30.253 --> 30:32.295
But having your support,

30:33.613 --> 30:36.134
I just wish my dad could see us.

30:36.247 --> 30:37.858
He'd be so proud.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.162
I thought you said you'd have friends here tonight.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.420
They're just not here yet.

30:53.792 --> 30:57.696
I don't want another evening of you sitting alone in the corner reading The Economist.

30:57.795 --> 30:58.914
It's embarrassing.

30:59.035 --> 31:00.139
They're going to be here.

31:00.551 --> 31:02.696
Well, excuse me if I don't hold my breath.

31:03.929 --> 31:04.933
Taylor!

31:05.308 --> 31:07.595
Sorry I'm late. Hi. Seth Cohen.

31:07.662 --> 31:09.920
Veronica Townsend. Nice to meet you.

31:10.119 --> 31:13.623
Taylor, is this the young man you brought the present for?

31:14.777 --> 31:15.510
Mom...

31:15.592 --> 31:16.763
Well, give it to him.

31:16.860 --> 31:19.691
She must have wrapped it and re-wrapped it four times before we left the house.

31:21.565 --> 31:23.549
Okay, fine.

31:24.163 --> 31:26.439
Oh, wow, that's, you know...

31:31.013 --> 31:32.732
Yakuza Demon?

31:33.673 --> 31:36.750
How did you get this? I thought they only released it in Japan.

31:36.897 --> 31:42.003
Yeah, my cousin works for Christie's in Tokyo and he sends me DVDs.

31:42.089 --> 31:44.091
I don't know. I just thought you would like it.

31:44.180 --> 31:45.461
It's amazing.

31:46.733 --> 31:49.674
Well, I'll just let you two be alone.

31:51.132 --> 31:51.897
Taylor.

31:52.059 --> 31:53.407
This is like so...

31:56.868 --> 31:57.758
Taylor.

31:58.072 --> 32:00.864
Go away, Seth! I don't need you feeling sorry for me.

32:00.957 --> 32:01.741
I don't.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.581
Oh... Well, why not?

32:04.193 --> 32:07.632
You heard her. She's horrible. She's always saying the same things.

32:07.738 --> 32:10.254
"Why don't people like you, Taylor? Why aren't you popular, Taylor?

32:10.349 --> 32:11.830
Why don't you have friends, Taylor?"

32:11.922 --> 32:13.871
Well, she doesn't know what she's talking about.

32:14.070 --> 32:16.163
Yeah, but that's just it. She does.

32:16.299 --> 32:19.435
I live in this dream world where I think that Summer is my friend,

32:19.511 --> 32:21.216
and I think that you like me.

32:21.318 --> 32:23.334
And the truth is, I don't have anybody.

32:23.413 --> 32:26.921
Oh, my God, if the Grinch had that stupid little dog.

32:27.527 --> 32:28.742
You think Summer's your friend?

32:28.837 --> 32:30.375
Yes, I know, I'm crazy.

32:30.453 --> 32:32.172
You know what? I like you.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.066
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

32:34.133 --> 32:35.832
- You pity me. It's different.
- No, I really do.

32:35.859 --> 32:37.790
I think you're funny.

32:39.544 --> 32:40.871
Stop teasing me.

32:40.974 --> 32:43.187
I'm not. Listen to me. I'm serious.

32:43.969 --> 32:45.948
You got great taste in movies.

32:46.084 --> 32:48.213
I think you're smart. I think you're interesting.

32:48.303 --> 32:49.171
Really?

32:49.286 --> 32:53.233
Yeah. And if you just relaxed a little bit, I think other people would see that, you know?

32:53.311 --> 32:55.758
They'd see that you're... one of a kind.

32:57.381 --> 32:58.537
Yeah, but...

32:58.620 --> 33:00.616
I've actually got to head back in right now, so...

33:00.716 --> 33:01.252
Seth, I...

33:01.333 --> 33:04.394
No, no, it's just because, uh, I think Summer may be looking for me.

33:04.485 --> 33:07.418
And you know, if she was to come out here and see us talking...

33:07.926 --> 33:09.725
So, uh... we're gonna talk at school.

33:09.812 --> 33:11.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:11.298 --> 33:12.553
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

33:13.621 --> 33:15.605
But I feel really good about this.

33:18.113 --> 33:19.153
It's happening.

33:23.506 --> 33:24.330
What's up, man?

33:24.443 --> 33:25.326
Hey.

33:25.773 --> 33:27.190
This party's unbelievable.

33:28.024 --> 33:29.217
Like something in a movie.

33:29.298 --> 33:30.171
Yeah, I know the feeling.

33:30.255 --> 33:31.318
You haven't seen Marissa, have you?

33:31.417 --> 33:33.657
No... but I just got here.

33:34.208 --> 33:34.991
Why? What's up?

33:35.077 --> 33:37.860
Nothing. Just... Saw her a little while ago, but...

33:40.336 --> 33:41.237
Eh, guess who?

33:41.522 --> 33:42.526
Hey, where are you?

33:42.611 --> 33:44.321
Well, right now...

33:44.475 --> 33:46.397
I'm with your girlfriend.

33:47.148 --> 33:49.221
Are you there, "little bitch"?

33:49.652 --> 33:50.871
Yeah, I'm here.

33:50.984 --> 33:52.413
She's fine.

33:52.995 --> 33:56.196
But she does miss you, so why don't you come get her?

33:56.339 --> 33:57.950
We're underneath the pier.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.165
What's up?

34:01.564 --> 34:03.032
Volcheck's got her.

34:03.343 --> 34:04.244
You should call the cops.

34:04.276 --> 34:07.261
Yeah. You call them. I'm going to finish this.

34:14.272 --> 34:15.213
Hi.

34:15.933 --> 34:16.791
Kirsten!

34:17.549 --> 34:20.212
I've raised over $300,000 in pledges.

34:20.324 --> 34:21.588
Oh, that's great.

34:21.676 --> 34:22.889
I think Julie's doing even better.

34:22.917 --> 34:23.409
Yeah?

34:23.418 --> 34:24.984
I wouldn't be surprised if we hit a million.

34:25.072 --> 34:27.130
Oh, where is she? I haven't seen her in a while.

34:27.184 --> 34:28.295
I don't know.

34:29.056 --> 34:30.203
Excuse me.

34:30.299 --> 34:33.038
Uh, excuse me, may I have your attention over here, please?

34:33.130 --> 34:34.655
I'm Julie Cooper-Nichol.

34:34.962 --> 34:36.569
Its so great to see all your faces.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.646
And I just want to thank you so much for coming here.

34:39.739 --> 34:44.951
With your assistance, we are going to be able to help a great many women in need.

34:48.368 --> 34:51.049
Thank you, uh... however, as you write your checks,

34:51.138 --> 34:56.581
I would ask that you make them out to "The National Foundation for Substance Abuse."

34:56.685 --> 35:02.549
As it so happens, your generosity has somewhat overwhelmed our small organization,

35:02.629 --> 35:07.003
and with the National Foundation's network, your money will go a lot further.

35:07.106 --> 35:09.297
And still be tax-deductible.

35:10.018 --> 35:12.933
So, thank you very much.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.577
Did you know about this?

35:18.675 --> 35:19.736
No, I...

35:20.626 --> 35:22.110
- I'll go talk to her.
- Okay.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.720
Julie!

35:25.514 --> 35:27.466
What the hell do you think you're doing?

35:27.573 --> 35:28.914
Oh, could you not hear me?

35:29.002 --> 35:31.031
I always hold the mic too far away.

35:32.064 --> 35:34.223
I wasn't kidding about the police, Julie.

35:34.316 --> 35:37.055
Now you get back over there and you tell everyone it was a mistake.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.140
Call them.

35:38.245 --> 35:39.109
What?

35:39.568 --> 35:40.936
Call the police.

35:44.908 --> 35:46.537
I thought so.

35:47.058 --> 35:50.725
Oh, what? You think you're back in society now so you don't need the money?

35:50.820 --> 35:52.408
Wake up, Julie.

35:52.512 --> 35:54.884
These people are never going to accept you.

35:54.982 --> 35:56.120
You don't have any friends here.

35:56.204 --> 35:57.140
Wrong.

35:57.254 --> 35:58.648
I have Kirsten.

35:58.751 --> 36:00.692
And I won't do this to her.

36:02.290 --> 36:06.124
Now... I think it's time you left. Don't you?

36:06.235 --> 36:10.094
This town's only really big enough for one manipulative bitch.

36:15.308 --> 36:16.757
Take care, sweetie.

36:21.298 --> 36:22.559
Where have you been?

36:23.620 --> 36:26.222
Just because I'm not talking to you doesn't mean you're allowed out of my sight.

36:26.265 --> 36:27.663
No, I was in the parking lot.

36:27.748 --> 36:28.892
You were in the parking lot?

36:28.990 --> 36:30.715
Why were you in the parking...

36:33.208 --> 36:34.495
Yakuza?

36:34.789 --> 36:35.531
Were you with Taylor?

36:35.611 --> 36:36.890
She's having an emotional crisis.

36:36.965 --> 36:38.377
Yeah, well, she's about to have a physical one.

36:38.445 --> 36:40.763
Summer... she thinks you're her friend.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.487
What? She is crazy. I hate her.

36:43.573 --> 36:45.054
I know. You along with everyone else.

36:45.144 --> 36:47.700
Look, this whole thing started because the other day,

36:47.784 --> 36:50.650
I was at the Lock-In, and I saw how awful her mother is.

36:50.727 --> 36:52.482
So you know what? I was nice to her.

36:52.572 --> 36:55.223
Okay, so that's the problem. That you were too nice.

36:55.327 --> 36:58.661
Well, she's not used to it. I think she's overreacting a little bit.

36:59.412 --> 37:01.847
She's just really lonely.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.466
Well, she doesn't make it easy to be nice to.

37:07.547 --> 37:08.604
I know.

37:12.944 --> 37:14.470
Just don't ever lie to me again. Okay?

37:14.561 --> 37:15.945
I won't, I swear.

37:18.249 --> 37:19.806
How badly do you want to go home right now and watch that movie?

37:19.891 --> 37:22.258
So bad it may actually kill me.

37:22.934 --> 37:24.027
Come on.

37:29.358 --> 37:31.131
Dude, this is a bad idea.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.012
Last year, Volcheck almost killed this guy...

37:33.096 --> 37:34.410
I know what I'm doing.

37:35.145 --> 37:37.098
Would you mind telling me what that is?

37:37.454 --> 37:39.268
I'm going to try and use my head, for once.

37:39.363 --> 37:40.125
With Volcheck?

37:40.207 --> 37:41.400
Just trust me.

37:42.056 --> 37:43.941
Whatever happens, go with it.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.414
All right.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.778
If that doesn't work?

37:47.386 --> 37:49.191
Grab Marissa and run.

37:55.684 --> 37:57.702
Aw, here comes your boy.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.054
Whoa, whoa, slow down, bro.

38:01.141 --> 38:01.909
You all right?

38:02.016 --> 38:03.514
Yeah. I'm okay.

38:03.609 --> 38:06.420
I said she can go, but she wanted to stay.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.174
Check it out. You brought Harper.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.469
You want some when I'm through with him?

38:11.549 --> 38:13.151
- Let's do it now.
- No, this is mine.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.087
Ryan!

38:15.177 --> 38:18.791
Whoa, bro! Come on, now, let's... let's not get crazy, man.

38:21.982 --> 38:22.774
You don't want to do this.

38:22.857 --> 38:24.967
Oh, you're giving me advice now? Come on!

38:26.123 --> 38:27.942
- Look at me.
- Come on.

38:28.454 --> 38:28.936
Ryan?

38:29.025 --> 38:30.294
Stay out of it!

38:34.265 --> 38:35.562
Come on! You're scared, huh ?

38:35.886 --> 38:37.406
You don't know what you're doing.

38:37.502 --> 38:39.280
I've been fighting guys like you for years.

38:39.367 --> 38:42.180
You want to bash my face in 'cause your life sucks? Fine!

38:45.009 --> 38:47.845
But you want to fight, you're gonna have to kill me.

38:56.581 --> 38:58.335
So, what's it gonna be?

39:07.197 --> 39:08.426
- Come on!
- All right!

39:11.578 --> 39:12.757
All right.

39:13.781 --> 39:15.105
Let's go, man.

39:15.304 --> 39:16.676
Guy's crazy.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.524
- Hey...
- Hey.

39:41.632 --> 39:43.085
Have a seat.

39:43.785 --> 39:46.818
So... the event was a success. Congratulations.

39:46.922 --> 39:48.339
Thank you.

39:49.156 --> 39:52.316
So... you want to tell me what's going on?

39:52.699 --> 39:54.081
What do you mean?

39:54.163 --> 39:55.983
Don't shut me out, Sandy.

39:57.627 --> 39:59.885
I fired four people today.

40:00.593 --> 40:03.359
I'm not sure I'm the guy for this job at all.

40:03.659 --> 40:05.373
I'm glad you're upset.

40:05.975 --> 40:07.042
Good pep talk.

40:07.134 --> 40:08.483
Means you care.

40:08.838 --> 40:12.014
Do you think my father gave a second thought to someone he fired?

40:12.092 --> 40:13.960
Exactly. He was successful.

40:14.048 --> 40:16.762
And his ego almost destroyed the company.

40:18.703 --> 40:23.063
If I had to choose between you and my father to run things,

40:23.338 --> 40:25.596
I would choose you every time.

40:28.666 --> 40:30.047
Thank you, baby.

40:30.601 --> 40:32.172
I'm not fragile.

40:32.904 --> 40:34.214
You don't have to protect me.

40:34.309 --> 40:36.271
I forget you are your father's daughter.

40:36.354 --> 40:37.223
No.

40:37.764 --> 40:39.640
I'm your wife.

40:44.105 --> 40:45.463
Good answer.

40:51.851 --> 40:53.411
That was intense.

40:55.493 --> 40:57.303
You really wanted to hit him, huh?

40:57.399 --> 40:58.502
No, no...

40:59.945 --> 41:01.349
No, I'm fine.

41:04.870 --> 41:07.638
Well, I didn't hit him, and I think that's the most important thing.

41:07.726 --> 41:08.512
Yeah, it is.

41:10.222 --> 41:11.877
I'm sorry I doubted you.

41:12.781 --> 41:15.282
Nah, you had plenty of evidence to back you up.

41:15.374 --> 41:17.043
Yeah, but you've changed.

41:17.786 --> 41:20.310
You're like a totally different Ryan Atwood.

41:20.408 --> 41:21.497
Was the old one so bad?

41:21.585 --> 41:23.803
No, no, just...

41:24.324 --> 41:25.471
darker.

41:27.441 --> 41:29.217
He scared me sometimes.

41:29.986 --> 41:31.988
Yeah. Me, too.

41:33.145 --> 41:35.593
All right, I should head home. I've got school in the morning.

41:35.681 --> 41:38.043
You and me gonna have to pull Summer away from that Yakuza movie.

41:38.123 --> 41:40.196
Oh, somehow, I think I'll manage.

41:44.275 --> 41:46.030
Hey, I'm proud of you.
