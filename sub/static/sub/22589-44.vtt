<i>NARRATOR".
When we last saw Batman and Robin...</i>

00:12.680 --> 00:14.641
<i>...they were locked into suits of armor...</i>

00:14.807 --> 00:21.105
<i>...and about to be pressed into paperweights
by a giant hydraulic crusher.</i>

00:21.272 --> 00:22.482
<i>In just one moment...</i>

00:22.649 --> 00:25.985
<i>...we'll see the crunching finish
of our adventure.</i>

01:48.943 --> 01:51.613
Batman. Robin. How did you get in there?

01:51.779 --> 01:55.867
The Penguin evidently loaded us
into one of your scrap trucks.

01:56.034 --> 01:58.077
But of course you couldn't have known that.

01:58.244 --> 02:00.663
How did you manage
to stay alive inside that crusher?

02:00.830 --> 02:03.207
It develops a hundred thousand pounds
of pressure.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.877
Fortunately, we were able
to reach our Utility Belts...

02:06.044 --> 02:10.214
...where we always keep our emergency
Bat air pumps to pump up the Batmobile's tires.

02:10.381 --> 02:14.010
You mean you countered
the hydraulic pressure with air pressure?

02:14.177 --> 02:16.137
As the crusher increased its pressure...

02:16.304 --> 02:19.724
...it automatically increased
the counter-air pressure...

02:19.891 --> 02:23.478
...and we were able
to maintain a small safety space...

02:23.645 --> 02:26.898
...inside this scrap-metal cocoon.

02:27.649 --> 02:31.861
It's lucky you think fast, Batman, or both of you
would have ended up as paperweights.

02:32.028 --> 02:36.324
Obviously that's what Penguin intended
when he put us inside your scrap truck.

02:36.491 --> 02:39.327
I think it's time we scrapped him.

02:39.494 --> 02:41.913
I think so too, Robin.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.499
I think so too.

02:51.089 --> 02:55.510
Now, let's get that priceless armor
into the safe.

02:59.389 --> 03:01.599
Why do we have to put it in the safe, Pengy?

03:01.766 --> 03:03.101
Don't you trust us?

03:03.267 --> 03:05.853
- You got any more stupid questions?
-Uh, no, boss.

03:06.020 --> 03:09.607
All right, then close the door.
And lock it, fink.

03:09.774 --> 03:13.903
Now, where is that dizzy filly of soul
and her dizzier aunt, huh?

03:14.070 --> 03:17.573
I'm not so sure
I like being called dizzy, darling.

03:17.740 --> 03:23.079
And I'm not sure I like all those bumpkins
cluttering up my nice cave.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.915
Where have you two been all this time?

03:26.082 --> 03:29.127
Out looking for old toads, darling.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.838
You did say you wanted one
of Aunt Hilda's potions.

03:32.004 --> 03:36.759
Absolutely essential as a grand finale
to our diabolical caper.

03:36.926 --> 03:39.220
Well, I don't know if I'll make it for you.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.598
Barging in here like a rude gang of rowdies.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.268
Oh, don't be angry, Aunt Hilda.

03:45.435 --> 03:48.312
After all, Penguin has no place else to go.

03:48.479 --> 03:53.359
No, aunty. You wouldn't want a poor, homeless
bird thrown out into the street, would you?

03:53.526 --> 03:56.904
- Quack, quack.
-You're lucky I'm softhearted.

03:57.071 --> 04:00.241
Run along, darling, and make your potion.
Pengy and I want to talk.

04:00.408 --> 04:01.576
Mm.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.372
Frankly, Pengy, I don't see
why you need Aunt Hilda's love potion...

04:06.539 --> 04:08.541
...to break into the subtreasury building.

04:08.708 --> 04:12.003
Why? Because those guards
are as dangerous as sharks, that's why.

04:12.170 --> 04:15.214
There's $10 million worth of gold
in that subtreasury.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.759
Why don't you just use the suits of armor?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.511
That worked once.
It won't work a second time.

04:20.678 --> 04:25.683
No, we need your aunt's famous love potion
to demobilize the guard.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.311
And once we're inside the vault, then what?

04:28.478 --> 04:30.938
You'd need a railroad train
to move that gold.

04:31.105 --> 04:35.860
Once we get inside, we'll use the plans I stole
from the Hexagon.

04:36.027 --> 04:37.320
- Ah!
- Ha-ha-ha.

04:37.487 --> 04:39.906
Oh, dear.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.367
My lizards are gone.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.328
Gone?

04:45.495 --> 04:47.622
They must have escaped.

04:47.789 --> 04:49.999
Unless those thugs ate them.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.876
That's hardly likely, darling.

04:52.043 --> 04:53.252
Are the lizards essential?

04:53.419 --> 04:58.132
Not as essential as the toad,
but the potion won't be as strong.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.259
It has to work. We can't take chances.

05:00.426 --> 05:03.888
Now, now, don't get yourself
in a stew, Pengy.

05:04.055 --> 05:07.475
- I think I'll give the potion a little help.
-How?

05:07.642 --> 05:11.854
You've heard of my famous dance
of the seven veils, haven't you?

05:12.021 --> 05:18.486
Well, with my dance and Aunt Hilda's potion,
we'll have an unbeatable combination.

05:20.404 --> 05:22.156
That swindler.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.284
Throwing the Dynamic Duo
into a scrap truck.

05:25.451 --> 05:27.620
I'd like to throw him into a scrap pile.

05:27.787 --> 05:31.874
Rock pile would be more appropriate, chief,
since there is one at Gotham State Prison.

05:32.041 --> 05:35.545
Unfortunately, this won't get back
the medieval armor...

05:35.711 --> 05:39.048
...or the military papers he stole
from the Hexagon, gentlemen.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.050
According to General MacGruder, Batman...

05:41.217 --> 05:43.719
...when the Penguin broke
into Room Z at the Hexagon...

05:43.886 --> 05:47.139
...all he took were some old plans dating
from World War ll.

05:47.306 --> 05:51.143
With all the top-secret documents in that room,
Penguin just took outdated plans?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.813
That's right.
Now, what would he want with them?

05:54.730 --> 05:58.067
Did General MacGruder say
what plans were taken?

05:58.234 --> 06:01.320
No, those old plans were taken
off the inventory lists years ago.

06:01.487 --> 06:05.741
It will take the Army many years to check back
and find out which ones were stored there.

06:05.908 --> 06:12.206
But it only took the Army hours to supply us
with those special metal-piercing bullets...

06:12.373 --> 06:15.501
...in case Penguin tried to use
those chain-mail suits again.

06:15.668 --> 06:17.712
I'm sure Penguin won't try that trick again.

06:17.879 --> 06:21.549
But the problem is to decide
which trick he will try.

06:21.716 --> 06:23.092
And where will he strike?

06:23.259 --> 06:26.345
And how do we get back
that priceless armor?

06:26.512 --> 06:30.600
And on top of everything else,
the police switchboard is flooded with calls...

06:30.766 --> 06:34.896
...about hundreds of lizards running around
the Murray Park section of Gotham City.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.731
Lizards, Chief O'Hara?

06:36.898 --> 06:37.940
That's right, Batman.

06:38.107 --> 06:40.026
And weird ones they were too.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.653
Robin, do lizards ring any bells for you?

06:42.820 --> 06:43.988
Marsha's aunt Hilda.

06:44.155 --> 06:47.241
I suggest we take a trip
to the Murray Park section.

06:49.744 --> 06:52.955
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in the basement
of the subtreasury building...</i>

06:53.122 --> 06:57.877
<i>...$10 million worth of gold bullion
is being carefully guarded.</i>

06:59.253 --> 07:02.089
Boy, this sure is a boring job.
Nothing ever happens here.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.633
Yeah, it's pretty routine.

07:03.799 --> 07:06.385
Who'd ever think of breaking
into a subtreasury?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.512
That gold's too heavy to move anywhere.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.559
You hear anything?

07:14.810 --> 07:16.562
Yeah.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.541
Hey, you there. Put your hands up.

08:09.991 --> 08:11.951
That should take care of them for a while.

08:12.118 --> 08:15.830
All right, finks, bring that stuff in here.
Quick. Quiet.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.039
Come on.

08:27.133 --> 08:31.053
At least 20 people reported seeing lizards
come out of this manhole, Batman.

08:31.220 --> 08:35.224
Yes, Robin, and I think we'll find what we want
at the other end of it.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.544
There is no honor among thieves, Robin.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.713
Batman and Robin.
How did you get in here?

09:05.880 --> 09:08.215
Put the Batcuffs on him, Robin.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.312
Oh, you'll never crack that safe, Batman.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.773
Just put your hands in these
and cut the comments.

09:33.491 --> 09:34.533
You did it.

09:36.786 --> 09:40.623
It's not difficult if you have steady nerves
and a good ear...

09:40.790 --> 09:43.834
...qualities destroyed
by the tenor of criminal life.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.544
Well, the laugh's on you, Batman.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.380
That's nothing compared
to the haul he's getting now. Heh, heh.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.466
- And what's that?
- Well, he's--

09:51.175 --> 09:54.512
Oh, no, you don't, Batman.
I might steal, but I don't squeal.

09:54.678 --> 09:59.767
And like the Penguin says, after this caper,
Gotham City is gonna be in the soup.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.313
Thank you.
You've just told me where Penguin is.

10:04.480 --> 10:07.233
- What?
-Clip his cuffs to the safe door, Robin.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.777
While we make a fast trip.

10:14.115 --> 10:16.408
How did that remark tell you
where Penguin is?

10:16.575 --> 10:20.204
It wasn't what he said, Robin,
but what Penguin had said.

10:20.371 --> 10:21.956
You mean about being in the soup?

10:22.123 --> 10:27.753
Knowing the Penguin's twisted mind,
he could mean only one thing.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.548
- Soup?
-Name a few, Robin.

10:30.714 --> 10:31.882
- Chowder.
-Mm.

10:32.049 --> 10:33.175
- Stew.
-Mm.

10:33.342 --> 10:34.552
- Ragout?
-Mm.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.137
- Bouillabaisse.
-Mm.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.930
Bouillon.

10:38.097 --> 10:39.265
Bullion.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.600
Exactly, old chum. Bullion.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.771
Penguin is undoubtedly at the federal
subtreasury at this very moment.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.857
And I'd better call Chief O'Hara.

11:20.556 --> 11:22.766
<i>- F our.
-F our .</i>

11:29.273 --> 11:30.649
- Five.
-Five.

11:30.816 --> 11:33.110
Hurry up. Hurry up.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.412
How much longer is Penguin going to take?

11:43.579 --> 11:45.331
I'm down to two veils.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.500
I'm just getting warmed up, darling.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.259
- Six.
-Six.

11:59.428 --> 12:02.097
Good. That's the last of it.

12:07.353 --> 12:08.979
Come on, Aunt Hilda, let's go.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.066
- Oh. Really, dearie?
-Really.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.609
Oh.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.403
- Oh, no, Marsha, don't go.
-No. Marsha, we adore you.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.239
We won't let you out of our sight.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.242
That's very sweet, darlings,
but I really must be going along.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.618
- No, no, Marsha.
-No, no.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.703
Here, dear.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.415
A little something to remember me by.
Come on, aunty.

12:34.171 --> 12:37.508
Excellent performance.
Your audience is still spellbound.

12:37.675 --> 12:40.928
It's a good thing you finished.
I was beginning to run out of veils.

12:41.095 --> 12:42.429
And love potion.

12:46.267 --> 12:49.144
Batman. How did that fink
get off the scrap heap?

12:49.311 --> 12:50.646
Never mind that now, darling.

12:50.813 --> 12:54.108
We'll be on the scrap heap
unless we beat them into the vault.

12:55.109 --> 12:56.902
There they are, Robin.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.703
We missed them.

13:06.412 --> 13:11.000
On the contrary, Robin.
We didn't miss them at all.

13:11.166 --> 13:15.045
I see what you mean, Batman.
He's got the gold, but we've got him.

13:18.299 --> 13:19.425
Are we too late, Batman?

13:19.591 --> 13:21.760
No, chief, we're just in time.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.887
Where's Penguin?

13:29.643 --> 13:31.395
That's beautiful, Batman.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.148
What an ironic end for that crook.

13:34.315 --> 13:37.526
But he never should have gotten in here
in the first place.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.531
- Have you got them, Batman?
-Yes, commissioner.

13:42.698 --> 13:47.161
And this time I don't think there's much chance
of them slipping through our fingers.

13:47.328 --> 13:49.371
Not through three feet of steel, there isn't.

13:49.538 --> 13:53.459
- Did you send men to that underground cave?
-Yes. We've recovered the armor.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.794
And it won't be long
before we recover Penguin.

13:55.961 --> 13:59.131
There's only enough air in that vault
to last a couple hours at most.

13:59.298 --> 14:03.385
I can't wait to get me mitts
on that cackling bird.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.399
It's been six hours, Batman.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.651
How are they breathing inside there?

14:24.281 --> 14:25.783
Ah.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.953
Ah.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.668
How much longer?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.838
It's gonna take a while yet, Pengy.
It's a big job.

14:40.005 --> 14:44.176
Don't worry, we can stay in here
as long as we want.

14:44.343 --> 14:47.930
Only thing is, if I keep having to listen to that,
I'll go straight.

14:48.097 --> 14:49.807
Can't you make her stop?

14:49.973 --> 14:53.477
Aunty only gets nervous
in closed rooms, darling.

14:53.644 --> 14:54.978
This keeps her occupied.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.856
Eugh. Not worth the price.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.567
Why don't you try biting your nails?

15:00.734 --> 15:03.570
Penguin could have carried tanks
of compressed fresh air...

15:03.737 --> 15:07.116
...inside with him,
but that's not what worries me.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.284
- What, then, Batman?
-Why, commissioner?

15:09.451 --> 15:16.458
Why? Why did Penguin
let us trap him so easily?

15:16.625 --> 15:20.212
I'm sure it has something to do
with those plans he stole from the Hexagon.

15:20.379 --> 15:24.299
- Whatever they are.
-But he couldn't possibly escape, Batman.

15:24.466 --> 15:28.470
Why, even if he blew a hole in the wall,
I've got 200 men stationed outside.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.515
I'm sure that you
and your fine force of men in blue...

15:31.682 --> 15:34.393
...can handle anything
in the realm of the ordinary, chief.

15:34.560 --> 15:39.815
But I have a hunch Penguin is cooking up
something quite out of the ordinary.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.985
Robin, do you have
your Bat-sound amplifier with you?

15:43.152 --> 15:45.195
Sure, Batman.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.205
Holy stereo. Listen to this.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.632
<i>This is the third day
Penguin and his henchmen...</i>

16:05.799 --> 16:07.968
<i>...have been holed up
inside the subtreasury vault.</i>

16:08.719 --> 16:12.598
Three days, Alfred. Imagine that.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.767
What can he be doing inside there?

16:15.934 --> 16:20.230
I imagine that our law-enforcement agencies
are asking the same question, madam.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.774
What could that mangy creature
be doing in there?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.234
I wish I knew, chief.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.028
And what's he doing for food?

16:26.195 --> 16:27.488
I wish I knew, commissioner.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.491
- And what's he--?
-I wish I knew, Robin.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.327
Pass the paprika, dearie.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.250
Mm, mm.

16:40.417 --> 16:45.464
This is the best batch
of toad stew I've ever made.

16:45.631 --> 16:50.093
Somehow I don't think the men are
too enthusiastic about your cuisine, darling.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.221
I don't see why not.

16:52.387 --> 16:56.558
Do you know how much vitamin B
there is in the average toad?

16:56.725 --> 16:58.268
No.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.313
Just twice the daily minimum requirement.

17:01.480 --> 17:05.358
Well, what's for dinner tonight?
I'm starved. Huh? Let me see.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.819
On. Agh.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.155
Not again. Can't you cook anything else?

17:10.321 --> 17:15.202
Do you have any idea how much vitamin B
there is in the average toad, darling?

17:19.580 --> 17:26.003
I have a feeling that Penguin
will make his move very soon.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.966
Whatever it is, Batman, we're ready for it.

17:29.132 --> 17:34.054
I'd like to check the outside of the building
again to be prepared for every eventuality.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.182
Well, Pengy, we're finished.

17:37.349 --> 17:38.559
Finished?

17:38.725 --> 17:42.354
Ah, let me see. Let me see.

17:44.356 --> 17:48.110
It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Heh.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.904
That Batman
thought he had me all wrapped up.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.449
That should teach
that Caped Codfish something.

17:54.616 --> 17:58.036
Never count your Penguins
before they're latched.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.211
Everything looks shipshape, Batman.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.173
Even if he blows his way through the wall,
we'll nail him before he goes ten feet.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.551
Yes, it would seem that way,
but I'm still worried.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.637
Listen.

18:17.556 --> 18:19.683
What's that noise?

18:21.977 --> 18:23.103
Holy armadillos.

18:25.355 --> 18:26.982
Take cover.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.946
A solid gold tank.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.782
So those were the plans Penguin stole
from the Hexagon.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.409
Yes, it all makes sense now.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.621
He set up his film company
to steal the armor from the museum.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.290
He used the armor to steal the plans
from the Hexagon.

18:43.457 --> 18:45.417
And used the plans
to build a solid gold tank.

18:45.584 --> 18:48.795
- Now he's invulnerable, Batman.
-No one is invulnerable, commissioner.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.464
Not even inside a tank.

18:50.631 --> 18:55.469
I'll stop that mangy bird
if it's the last thing I ever do.

18:55.636 --> 18:58.347
- What's Chief O'Hara up to?
-Chief O'Hara!

19:02.643 --> 19:03.894
He's blocked the tank.

19:04.061 --> 19:07.064
- But he'll be crushed like a walnut.
-The brave fool.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.087
- Chief O'Hara!
-Quickly. Help me with this.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.759
Watch it, Batman.

19:40.681 --> 19:45.060
I never ever thought
I'd see your face again, Batman.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.354
That was a brave gesture, Chief O'Hara.

19:47.521 --> 19:51.024
We need more than gestures
to stop that fiend.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.401
Quickly, to the Batmobile.

19:52.567 --> 19:55.612
- Are you all right, chief?
- Look what he done to me.

20:09.376 --> 20:13.213
How's it feel riding around
in $20 million, Marsha?

20:13.380 --> 20:15.590
The springs aren't very good, darling.

20:15.757 --> 20:20.595
Springs? Every bolt of this machine
is worth a carload of springs.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.724
Who's firing that gun?

20:23.890 --> 20:27.060
Must be Aunt Hilda. She loves loud noises.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.482
- Oh!
- Stop that!

20:32.649 --> 20:33.942
Those shells are solid gold.

20:34.109 --> 20:37.654
Every time she fires that cannon,
it costs $50,000.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.407
Oh, let her have some fun, Pengy.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.659
After all, you're a millionaire now.

20:42.826 --> 20:45.996
Even a millionaire blinks at $50,000.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.716
We should be able to intercept him
at the next crossroads.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.426
Roger.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.220
But what do we do when we intercept him?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.515
Can you handle the Batzooka?

21:05.682 --> 21:07.142
The Batzooka.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.394
I forgot all about it.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.313
You bet I can handle it, Batman.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.523
I hope your aim is good.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.111
Heh, heh. They're not even following us.

21:18.278 --> 21:22.491
They knew it was hopeless. Even Batman
and Robin were smart enough to see that.

21:22.657 --> 21:26.077
Looks like Batman and Robin
weren't so smart after all, darling.

21:26.244 --> 21:27.788
Hmm?

21:29.289 --> 21:31.750
Whoa! Blow them to bits.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.795
Sound general quarters. Batten the hatches.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.713
Dive, dive.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.708
Easy, Robin.

22:14.417 --> 22:18.421
That's a low-down, underhanded trick.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.758
Oh, and foiled again.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.552
It's exasperating.

22:23.718 --> 22:26.304
Oh. Be a good loser, darling.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.557
Page from your own book, huh, Penguin?

22:28.723 --> 22:32.060
It's your fault! Wasting those golden shells.

22:32.227 --> 22:36.940
Be quiet, dearie, or I'll turn you into a toad.

22:37.107 --> 22:40.443
Should I, Batman?
-Thank you, we have other plans for Penguin.

22:40.610 --> 22:43.113
You know, darling, it really is a shame.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.116
You and I could have had a marvelous career
in movies.

22:46.283 --> 22:51.621
I'm afraid your movie career
will be interrupted for quite a while, Marsha.

23:09.180 --> 23:12.517
It was very nice of Batman
to donate Penguin's film...

23:12.684 --> 23:15.937
...to the Wayne Federation of Boys Clubs.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.648
I'm sure the boys will enjoy it.

23:18.815 --> 23:20.775
Too bad Penguin and Marsha can't see it.

23:20.942 --> 23:22.777
Somehow I doubt if they'd want to, Dick.

23:22.944 --> 23:28.450
Besides, by the time they get out of prison,
this film will probably be on the late show.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.371
Whatever happened to that weird old lady...

23:33.538 --> 23:36.625
...who was related to Marsha?
-Aunt Hilda?

23:36.791 --> 23:39.461
She's back at her old post,
teaching a cooking class...

23:39.628 --> 23:43.423
...at the Bruce Wayne School
of Home Economics.

23:43.590 --> 23:49.971
She never would have left in the first place
if it hadn't been for her niece Marsha.

23:53.016 --> 23:58.188
You know, Bruce,
I think Batman is quite a good actor.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.321
Oh, my, he's very romantic.

24:07.739 --> 24:11.034
I think Batman would appreciate
your compliment, Aunt Harriet.

24:12.077 --> 24:16.706
Well, perhaps Batman
has some show business in his blood.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.668
Hmm. Don't we all, sir?

24:20.418 --> 24:22.712
Don't we all?
