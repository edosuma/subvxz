00:21.151 --> 00:23.501
- I know, Mom, uh-huh.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.333
Mom, I gotta go to sleep.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.161
I had a couple drinks tonight.

00:33.555 --> 00:36.471
Yeah.
Yeah, I love you.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.473
Okay.

00:38.516 --> 00:45.567
<i>♪</i>

00:53.575 --> 00:54.793
Hello?

00:56.621 --> 00:58.536
Is someone there?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.712
- Be a good girl.
-

01:05.239 --> 01:07.197
- Hey.
What do you got?

01:07.241 --> 01:09.156
- Vic is Rosie Zaran, 23.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.071
She says the guy came
through the window.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.246
- We get a description?
- Not much.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.204
He wore a mask.
- Okay.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.597
Canvassing.
Pulling street cams?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.120
- Uh, yeah.
We're on it.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.817
And CSU's running
the apartment.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.124
So they were finishing a bodega
break-in about two blocks away

01:21.168 --> 01:22.343
when the call came in.
- All right.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.692
And the vic's still
in the apartment?

01:23.735 --> 01:25.085
- She didn't want to leave.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.695
I don't argue.
That's your job.

01:26.738 --> 01:29.263
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

01:34.398 --> 01:37.401
- Rosie.

01:37.445 --> 01:39.142
This can be pretty upsetting.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.711
It might be better if
we could talk at the hospital.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.718
Rosie?

01:49.761 --> 01:52.721
- I'm sorry.
What?

01:54.201 --> 01:55.550
Where--where was I?

01:55.593 --> 01:57.900
- You were saying
that he had on a ski mask.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.511
- Yeah, I could
only see his eyes.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.773
Just for a second,

02:01.817 --> 02:06.126
before he pulled out
the--the duct...tape.

02:08.563 --> 02:11.696
He whispered, "Be a good girl."

02:11.740 --> 02:13.872
And then--
and then he tied my hands

02:13.916 --> 02:16.310
like--like, in prayer.

02:16.353 --> 02:17.876
- Did he say anything else?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.489
- No.

02:21.532 --> 02:25.493
No, no, he was silent
while he raped me.

02:25.536 --> 02:26.842
When he was done, he said,

02:26.885 --> 02:31.325
"If you call the cops,
I will kill you."

02:31.368 --> 02:32.804
- She did agree
to a rape kit?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.937
- Eventually.
But don't get your hopes up.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.765
He used a condom.
He wore gloves.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.810
And there are no security cams
on that block.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.509
- So no prints,
no DNA, and no video.

02:41.552 --> 02:44.207
We're looking at a pro.
- Maybe a serial.

02:44.251 --> 02:46.296
I just found a pattern
number four in the Bronx.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.907
Six vics in the past year.

02:48.951 --> 02:50.909
- I don't remember reading
about this in the press.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.955
Same M.O.?
- Single women.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.826
Window entry, duct-taped.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.524
Told to be "good girls"?

02:56.567 --> 02:59.657
- Okay, our case is in Inwood
up by the Bronx,

02:59.701 --> 03:01.355
so he's staying close to home.

03:01.398 --> 03:03.922
- Kenyatta's still captain
at Bronx SVU?

03:03.966 --> 03:05.576
- He was reassigned
a few months ago.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.274
Fin, do you not read
your emails?

03:07.317 --> 03:08.579
- Do you want us to head up?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.538
- Come with, but I'll
take the lead on this.

03:10.581 --> 03:13.323
I used to work with the new CO
when she worked at Major Case.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.283
My first question--
why weren't we looped in?

03:16.326 --> 03:18.328
- Hmm.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.204
- All right, domestics,
drug-facilitated...

03:24.247 --> 03:25.683
David's Pizza!

03:25.727 --> 03:27.381
- Lieutenant Barek.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.515
- Captain Benson.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.301
It's been a while.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.303
Uh, wait, do I owe you a call?

03:36.346 --> 03:37.565
- From a few months back.

03:37.608 --> 03:38.740
I was just calling

03:38.783 --> 03:40.568
to congratulate you
on your promotion.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.701
- So you came all the way up to
the Bronx to congratulate me?

03:43.745 --> 03:44.920
- No.
- No.

03:44.963 --> 03:48.271
- You didn't get my email
from this morning?

03:48.315 --> 03:50.317
- I don't read
my emails either.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.536
Sergeant Tutuola.
Nice to meet you.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.234
- You too.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.279
So what can I do for you?

03:56.323 --> 03:58.890
- Well, we caught a rape case
last night in Inwood

03:58.934 --> 04:02.024
and it matches
one of your patterns.

04:02.067 --> 04:05.288
The vic's hands were
duct-taped in prayer.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.550
- Good Girl Rapist.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.465
He started before I took over.

04:08.509 --> 04:11.903
My best investigator,
Ari Moldovan, is the lead.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.688
- We brought along
our case file.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.603
- Great.
I'll give that to Moldovan.

04:15.646 --> 04:18.693
- If it's the same serial,
how about we coordinate?

04:18.736 --> 04:19.824
- Why?

04:19.868 --> 04:22.784
No disrespect,
but it's a Bronx case.

04:22.827 --> 04:23.959
- You're new to SVU.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.570
We usually keep
each other informed.

04:30.095 --> 04:32.620
- Okay, look, Chief Garland
was really clear

04:32.663 --> 04:35.623
about what my job was here,
which was to build trust.

04:35.666 --> 04:38.016
I bring Manhattan in,
there goes morale.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.410
- There's a rapist out there.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.586
Shouldn't that be our priority?

04:42.630 --> 04:43.935
- It is.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.418
Thanks for coming up here
and all.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.333
Sorry you wasted a trip,

04:50.377 --> 04:52.422
but we got this.

04:52.466 --> 04:56.774
<i>♪</i>

05:00.996 --> 05:08.046
<i>♪</i>

05:44.909 --> 05:47.477
- Well, in my experience,
too many cooks spoil the sauce.

05:47.521 --> 05:49.261
<i>- All right, listen--</i>

05:49.305 --> 05:50.872
- So you think
our guy's in Manhattan?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.352
That would be a first.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.657
- Well, it's
the exact same M.O.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.442
- He duct-taped her hands,
her eyes.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.791
Told her to be a "good girl."

05:56.834 --> 05:58.401
- Worth talking
to the vic, Ari.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.403
- Not until Barek signs off.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.406
She's new, wants to show
she can run a tight ship.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.625
I'll ask.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.844
- Too many boots.
It's like too many cooks.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.629
- Not if you manage them
correctly.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.067
- Lieu, sorry to interrupt.

06:12.110 --> 06:13.808
- No, it's great timing.

06:13.851 --> 06:16.550
Sergeant Moldovan,
this is Captain Benson.

06:16.593 --> 06:18.465
Sergeant Tutuola.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.857
- You here to poach our case?
- No, no, no.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.381
This isn't about credit.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.034
We're just trying to get
a bad guy off the street.

06:23.078 --> 06:24.384
- No doubt.
So give us your file.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.559
- We don't hand over rape cases

06:25.602 --> 06:28.083
unless Chief Garland
tells us to.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.650
- Garland?

06:29.693 --> 06:32.087
That Harvard guy trying to
tell me how to investigate now.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.697
- Sergeant.

06:33.741 --> 06:37.701
Look, I have a lot of respect
for the Chief and his time.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.834
There's no reason
to bring him into this.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.664
- One vic last February,
two in March.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.840
One in September,
two in December.

06:45.883 --> 06:46.971
- Thanks.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.843
- Then he takes
over a month off

06:48.886 --> 06:50.540
until he hit Inwood last night?

06:50.584 --> 06:53.021
- If it's even the same guy.
- Do you have any suspects?

06:53.064 --> 06:54.849
- No prints,
no DNA, no vic ID.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.851
- And it's just you and Ruz
on the team?

06:56.894 --> 06:58.461
- Welcome to the Bronx--

06:58.505 --> 07:00.028
short on resources,
long on trouble.

07:00.071 --> 07:03.031
- Can I ask why the public
wasn't alerted?

07:03.074 --> 07:05.033
- This past year,
a rapist in the BX?

07:05.076 --> 07:06.774
Not a high priority
for the press.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.515
We figured, he's not on to us,

07:08.558 --> 07:10.038
he'll drop his guard,
make a mistake.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.519
- Goren used to say,

07:12.562 --> 07:15.478
our mistakes are our signature.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.698
We all follow rules
the same way.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.439
Our mess-ups?
All our own.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.962
- Yeah, but he may have
already made a mistake.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.181
We need to re-interview
all of these victims.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.444
- The last thing they need--

07:24.487 --> 07:26.141
- Fresh eyes?
Good idea.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.882
Do you mind if one of us
sits in, Captain?

07:27.925 --> 07:30.101
- Not at all.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.063
- He said...

07:35.106 --> 07:37.413
"Be a good girl."

07:37.457 --> 07:40.721
But Sergeant Moldovan
knows all this.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.592
- He's still working the case.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.073
- Can you describe
your attacker?

07:45.116 --> 07:47.771
- Not really.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.513
He was tall, I guess.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.689
- You said he wanted
to stay around afterwards?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.561
- I was just...

07:54.604 --> 07:56.084
waiting for him to kill me.

07:56.127 --> 07:58.216
- Can you tell the sergeant
what he did?

07:58.260 --> 08:00.828
- Just sat on the bed,

08:00.871 --> 08:03.091
talking.

08:03.134 --> 08:05.702
- He told me
he liked my apartment.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.487
- How long did he stay?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.532
- It felt like forever.

08:11.055 --> 08:14.581
He said he liked girls
who collect animal figurines.

08:16.278 --> 08:19.020
- Did he ever threaten you?
- No.

08:19.063 --> 08:22.502
He asked me my favorite color.

08:22.545 --> 08:23.633
It's black,

08:23.677 --> 08:27.507
but, um--but I said pink.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.118
He liked that.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.859
- He said
if I went to the police,

08:31.902 --> 08:33.861
he would come back and kill me.

08:33.904 --> 08:36.080
- Did you believe him?

08:37.604 --> 08:38.953
Don't worry.
He won't.

08:38.996 --> 08:42.086
Guys like him?
Control freaks.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.132
But he's not here.
He's a ghost, Rosie.

08:44.175 --> 08:46.134
- If you say so.

08:46.177 --> 08:49.050
I can still smell the whiskey
on his breath.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.878
- That's helpful.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.096
- You didn't mention that
before.

08:52.140 --> 08:55.578
Anything else come to mind?

08:55.622 --> 08:58.059
- To be honest,
I had a few last night.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.061
- It's okay.

09:00.104 --> 09:02.977
That doesn't matter.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.807
- Hold this, will you?

09:12.160 --> 09:14.728
- She was comfortable with you.
- I was skeptical,

09:14.771 --> 09:16.904
but that training, questioning
in a non-linear way?

09:16.947 --> 09:18.253
Really helps vics
recover memories.

09:18.296 --> 09:21.604
- Oh, yeah.
So this sounds like your guy?

09:21.648 --> 09:24.085
- Number seven.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.174
I just don't know
why he left the Bronx.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.831
Barek wants me back uptown.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.615
Still a little turfy
about this.

09:32.659 --> 09:33.834
- Hmm.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.792
- I left four messages
for the Bronx DA.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.272
They know we're teaming up
on this, right?

09:37.315 --> 09:38.752
- Barek said she'd call them.

09:38.795 --> 09:40.754
You know, her political chops
are worse than yours.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.233
- It might take a day, Carisi.

09:42.277 --> 09:44.018
- But she's on board?
- She's still finding her way.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.672
But she definitely wants
to find this guy.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.848
- Okay, good.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.153
So these women,

09:49.197 --> 09:50.590
doesn't look like
he has a type.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.679
- No, so it's more
about access, vulnerability.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.768
- They all live alone.
Easy entry.

09:54.811 --> 09:57.161
First floor, or window
right off the fire escape.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.033
- He works different
neighborhoods in the Bronx.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.774
Sometimes at day,
sometimes at night.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.689
- Bad news from Ruz.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.647
Good Girl Rapist struck again.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.871
- I was sleeping.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.569
Why?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.266
- The vic's name is Paz Orduña.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.920
I'll meet her at Barnabas.
- Okay.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.226
Kat, go with.
- Copy, Captain.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.706
Come on.
- Tonight's attack

10:19.749 --> 10:21.142
is consistent
with previous rapes.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.883
We now believe we got
a serial working the Bronx.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.667
- You know anything about this?
- No, not at all.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.147
- We advise residents,
keep your windows,

10:26.190 --> 10:27.627
your doors locked.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.150
If you're a victim
of an assault...

10:29.193 --> 10:30.673
- So why now?
- If you see something,

10:30.717 --> 10:32.370
if you hear something,
please call our tip line.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.285
- Your guess is
as good as mine.

10:34.329 --> 10:37.724
Lieutenant, you called
the press before you called us?

10:37.767 --> 10:39.639
- No, they beat us here.
Those crime apps--

10:39.682 --> 10:40.988
- We're still working
this together.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.685
- We're in the middle
of helping a rape victim.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.165
Sorry I hurt your feelings.
- That's not

10:44.208 --> 10:45.862
what this is about.
- It's not?

10:45.906 --> 10:48.082
How many lights did you run to
get here before the press left?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.866
- Why don't you take it easy?
Not now, Sergeant.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.302
- You can pitch up your guys
all you want--

10:51.346 --> 10:52.652
- Take it easy.
- She's not my CO.

10:52.695 --> 10:53.783
- All right!
Back down!

10:53.827 --> 10:55.132
- Heard what she said.
Stand down.

10:55.176 --> 10:56.699
- You stand down!
- Hey, let's take this inside.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.005
- Get out of my face!
It's my case!

10:58.048 --> 10:59.746
These are my vics!
- Hey! Yo, get off her, man.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.008
- Get your damn hands off me!
- Hey!

11:01.051 --> 11:02.139
- Stop.
- Okay!

11:02.183 --> 11:04.098
- Fin, stop.

11:08.406 --> 11:10.017
- So you both made
the front page.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.235
You must be very proud.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.498
- Chief, it looks worse
than it was.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.196
- Small comfort.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.154
The department is working
to regain credibility,

11:17.198 --> 11:19.679
and two of our sergeants engage
in a public brawl?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.245
In front of press?

11:21.289 --> 11:23.073
- Not to make excuses for Ari,

11:23.117 --> 11:25.206
but this case,
it's eating him up.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.382
He can't sleep
until he catches this guy.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.384
- Okay, with all due respect,

11:29.427 --> 11:31.516
if he doesn't get some rest,
he's gonna blow the case.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.649
- Excuse me?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.304
- Your sergeant is off.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.653
He blindsided us.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.568
- We were in pursuit!

11:39.611 --> 11:41.396
What were we supposed to do?
- Are you two done?

11:41.439 --> 11:44.704
- Stop? Make a phone call--
- Are you done?

11:44.747 --> 11:46.836
- I'm sorry.
- I'll wait.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.359
Is this how you lead
by example?

11:48.403 --> 11:51.232
- I'm sorry, Chief.
- I'm sorry.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.147
- I'm due at CompStat,

11:53.190 --> 11:56.063
where I'll have to explain
why we have a serial rapist

11:56.106 --> 11:57.455
who has just struck
for the eighth time

11:57.499 --> 12:00.154
while two of my units
are fighting.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.069
- Do you want us there?

12:02.112 --> 12:04.245
- Well, they asked.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.162
But I'm gonna tell them
you're too busy

12:08.205 --> 12:11.469
setting up the Bronx-Manhattan
Good Girl Rapist Task Force.

12:14.516 --> 12:18.259
<i>♪</i>

12:18.302 --> 12:21.305
- So...we're now officially
a joint task force?

12:21.349 --> 12:24.265
- Yup.
Who's gonna tell Moldovan?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.225
- So you said you wanted
to talk to me about something?

12:28.269 --> 12:29.618
- Maybe it's just
a coincidence,

12:29.661 --> 12:32.273
but Paz, last night's vic?
- Mm-hmm?

12:32.316 --> 12:34.536
- Good Girl Rapist worked
this neighborhood before.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.234
Last April.
- April?

12:37.278 --> 12:38.801
I don't remember seeing
an assault in April.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.282
Are you sure?
- April 9th.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.763
I remember because
it was my sister's birthday.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.200
I should've
mentioned it earlier.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.856
I think her name was
Bella ...rdner.

12:49.899 --> 12:53.120
- Okay, let me take a look
at the DD5.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.775
- The thing is,
there isn't one.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.515
I took her disclosure,
same M.O.,

12:57.559 --> 12:59.735
but she never followed up
with me.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.784
My captain at the time,

13:04.827 --> 13:06.437
Kenyatta,

13:06.481 --> 13:08.831
he said to circular-file
the report.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.920
- And Moldovan
went along with that?

13:10.964 --> 13:12.574
- Yeah.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.839
- Don't blame Ruz.
This is all on me.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.885
I completely forgot about it.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.364
- Forgot about a rape?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.671
- I had a 105 fever.

13:22.714 --> 13:24.499
I thought I was dying
from the 'rona.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.675
- But Ruz did take
a disclosure?

13:26.718 --> 13:27.981
- Over the phone.

13:28.024 --> 13:30.200
She asked the vic
to meet her at the hospital,

13:30.244 --> 13:32.855
but the woman never showed.
Never called Ruz back.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.466
- And your old captain
never followed up?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.599
- Last spring,
with the bodies piling up?

13:37.642 --> 13:40.254
We had more refrigerated trucks
sitting outside hospitals

13:40.297 --> 13:41.255
than supermarkets.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.386
- Thank you.
I remember.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.301
- Yeah, so do I.
But that was then.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.652
Now, we need to talk
to Bella Gardner,

13:47.696 --> 13:49.524
see what she has to say.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.701
- Ruz and I will make it right.
- Actually, take Rollins with.

13:52.744 --> 13:55.312
The vic might blame Ruz.

13:55.356 --> 13:58.576
- Hey, you ready?
- Sure.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.535
So this is how
the other half lives.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.190
Lots of elbow room.
Nice waiting area.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.540
Your cleaning crew
comes through, what,

14:05.583 --> 14:06.889
four times a day?
- Yeah.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.544
It's a regular Xanadu.

14:13.330 --> 14:17.291
<i>-</i> The officer on the phone
was completely overwhelmed.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.684
She wanted me to meet her
at the ER,

14:19.728 --> 14:20.903
but back in April?

14:20.947 --> 14:23.645
I wasn't going anywhere
near a hospital.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.908
- Understandable.
And we're sorry.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
You should have gotten
a better response.

14:27.954 --> 14:30.957
- But I'm getting one now
because you think this guy is

14:31.000 --> 14:32.828
the serial rapist
you're looking for?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.830
- Would you mind telling us
what you remember

14:34.874 --> 14:36.745
from the night of the assault?

14:38.703 --> 14:41.968
- He had booze on his breath.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.320
He taped my hands,

14:46.363 --> 14:47.974
and my eyes.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.454
- Before that,
did you get a look at him?

14:50.498 --> 14:53.414
- No, just a shape in the dark.

14:53.457 --> 14:56.417
- Did he talk much?
- Not really.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.549
After he taped
my hands and eyes,

14:58.593 --> 15:02.423
he whispered,
"Be a good girl."

15:02.466 --> 15:04.425
- Did he say anything else
to you?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.383
- When he was done, he said

15:06.427 --> 15:08.603
if I told the police,
he'd know,

15:08.646 --> 15:11.432
and he'd kill me.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.999
- We've really screwed up.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.609
That brings his vics
to, what, nine?

15:14.652 --> 15:15.871
- I don't know.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.613
Most of these rapes,
he's Chatty Cathy,

15:18.656 --> 15:21.311
but with Bella and Rosie,
he's silent

15:21.355 --> 15:22.922
until the end when
he threatens to kill them.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.706
- They both said
he had booze on his breath.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.621
Maybe when he's drunk,
he drops the small talk.

15:26.664 --> 15:30.016
- Hmm.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.452
- He may have struck again.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.019
Attempted sexual assault
near Hunts Point.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.498
- Attempted?

15:34.542 --> 15:36.500
- The vic's dog took a chunk
out of his hand and leg.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.981
He's on the run.
Kat and Ruz are in pursuit.

15:39.025 --> 15:41.636
Look, if you want to head home,
see your kids, I got this.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.029
- No, we're all in.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.596
I'll call my sergeant.
Let's go.

15:48.556 --> 15:50.514
- We got blood!
Call it in!

15:50.558 --> 15:51.820
- Special Victims to Central.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.779
Suspect's heading south
on Dupont--bleeding.

16:06.487 --> 16:07.531
- We got a visual.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.490
He's heading
into the Expo Center.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.631
Over there!

16:24.853 --> 16:26.681
- Let's go!
Let's go!

16:26.724 --> 16:28.378
- Suspect has entered silos

16:28.422 --> 16:30.424
near expo entrance
on Oak Point Avenue.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.034
We are in pursuit.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.384
Responding units,
form a perimeter.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.734
Go, go, go!

16:43.524 --> 16:45.787
Whoa!

17:19.908 --> 17:21.953
- NYPD! Stop!
Hands in the air!

17:21.997 --> 17:23.564
Take one more step,
and I'll shoot!

17:23.607 --> 17:25.566
- Look, man.
I got my hands up.

17:25.609 --> 17:26.915
- Moldovan!

17:38.013 --> 17:39.667
- Shots fired.
All units respond.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.321
Ari.
What the hell, Ari?

17:41.364 --> 17:43.671
- I told him not to move.
- He slipped!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.107
- He was reaching
for something.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.022
- I fell--
- You shut up!

17:47.066 --> 17:49.068
You're lucky you didn't have
two bullets in your chest.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.113
- Sergeant, it might be a
good time to put away your gun.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.462
Yeah?
I got this.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.421
Get your hands up
where we can see them.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.945
Get your ass up here.
And don't do anything stupid.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.164
Nice and easy.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.432
- You're under arrest
for attempted rape.

18:05.475 --> 18:09.131
- NYPD staying
bein' crooked, huh?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.090
- You got him?
- Yeah.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.396
- Nice work.
- Congratulations, Sarge.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.531
- Come on, man.

18:17.574 --> 18:21.012
- He was unarmed.
- How do we know that?

18:21.056 --> 18:22.710
- Is that how
we're playing this?

18:22.753 --> 18:25.321
You saw a gun?
- I saw what I saw.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.280
We'll find a weapon down there.
-

18:27.323 --> 18:28.716
I'm not losing my job
over this.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.109
- You won't.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.675
Look, I lost my cool.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.416
You know how these cases
get under your skin.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.722
I missed.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.724
Aside from the dog bites,
the scumbag's fine.

18:36.767 --> 18:39.118
- Yeah.
- I'll do the paperwork.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.512
Anyone asks, you got here
after I fired.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.514
- No.

18:44.558 --> 18:47.169
I'll say you said
you saw a gun.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.649
- I did.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.956
- Rollins, Moldovan.
You guys okay?

18:52.000 --> 18:55.264
- We're fine.
Right, Rollins?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.136
- Yeah.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.963
- Well, you fired your gun.
You know the drill.

18:59.007 --> 19:01.270
- Got it.
Turn in my weapon, bend over.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.750
- Hey, you got your guy.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.188
- Thank Detective Rollins.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.759
- Something I should know?

19:13.761 --> 19:15.502
It's the Bronx.

19:18.548 --> 19:22.683
<i>♪</i>

19:22.726 --> 19:24.598
<i>- They still haven't found
the weapon?</i>

19:24.641 --> 19:27.731
- Hmm, trying to find a gun
overnight in the river?

19:29.646 --> 19:32.475
Look, the Bronx DA is
a cop hater.

19:32.519 --> 19:34.434
I got to protect my sergeant.

19:34.477 --> 19:36.479
And he told me
Rollins backed him up.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.394
- She said what she saw
and what she didn't.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.266
- What do we have
on the suspect?

19:40.309 --> 19:42.268
- Danny Gonzalez, 38.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.486
He's a Gypsy cab driver.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.358
He knows every street
in the Bronx.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.750
- And he's a devout Catholic.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.491
Same pattern
as the other rapes.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.667
- Do you think it's a good idea
for Moldovan to be in the room?

19:50.711 --> 19:54.105
- It's his collar.
It's his case.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.716
Force Investigation's
already cleared him

19:55.759 --> 19:58.371
working on it.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.286
- Serial rapist?

20:00.329 --> 20:02.201
I know what this is.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.377
My client was unarmed,
you shot at him,

20:04.420 --> 20:06.335
you have to justify--
- Don't pull that crap in here.

20:06.379 --> 20:07.554
- So you're saying your client

20:07.597 --> 20:09.338
wasn't in Dana Ortiz's
apartment?

20:09.382 --> 20:14.125
Even though his blood is
all over her floor?

20:14.169 --> 20:16.563
- Look, I'll be honest
with you.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.217
- Danny.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.436
- I was
in that girl's apartment.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.090
But I'm no rapist.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.700
I was casing the alley,
saw an open window.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.529
Figured I could grab
a cell phone or some jewelry.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.270
- So you didn't know
she was home?

20:28.314 --> 20:30.098
- Middle of the day.
People should be at work.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.708
- Yeah, of course.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.754
- I never would've gone in.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.799
I didn't know she had a dog,
for damn sure.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.192
- She surprised you?

20:37.236 --> 20:39.803
That why you duct-taped
her eyes and her hands?

20:39.847 --> 20:41.588
Told her to be a "good girl"?

20:41.631 --> 20:44.330
- I was talking to the dog.
- Danny.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.245
May I?

20:46.288 --> 20:48.247
This is an attempted burglary
gone bad.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.205
He didn't even take anything.
He was unarmed.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.163
Nothing he did justifies
being shot.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.643
- All right.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.384
Maybe he can help us out
with some other burglaries.

20:55.428 --> 20:58.257
- Nine other victims.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.389
The same M.O.
- You guys are unbelievable.

21:00.433 --> 21:03.218
Now you're trying to pin all
your open cases on my client?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.872
- We're saying,
now that we have his DNA,

21:04.915 --> 21:06.743
if there's any match
at the other scenes,

21:06.787 --> 21:09.268
might be a good time
for him to get in front of it.

21:10.530 --> 21:13.489
- I think we're done.
- No, it's just...

21:13.533 --> 21:15.839
- Actually, I'll take a look.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.364
Maybe I can help.
- We appreciate that.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.801
- Riverdale.
March 1st, 2020.

21:20.844 --> 21:23.412
- Let me think.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.675
- And Wellen Park?

21:25.719 --> 21:27.677
March 5th?

21:29.244 --> 21:31.768
- This woman,
what's she saying?

21:31.812 --> 21:34.336
- How about
we ask the questions?

21:34.380 --> 21:36.643
Do you have alibis
for these dates, Danny?

21:38.514 --> 21:41.256
- It was a long time ago.
- So that's a no.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.303
- Mott Haven?
April 9th?

21:45.304 --> 21:47.218
- April 9th?

21:47.262 --> 21:49.569
- Can't remember where you were
that night either, Danny?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.877
Actually, I can.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.490
Locked up in Tallahassee

21:57.533 --> 21:59.143
on a B&E.

21:59.187 --> 22:00.493
- Nice try.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.277
If you're saying
that one rapist

22:02.321 --> 22:04.584
is good for all of these,

22:04.627 --> 22:07.717
then you got the wrong guy.

22:12.243 --> 22:14.463
- That B&E story?
A joke.

22:14.507 --> 22:16.030
This is definitely our perp,
ten vics.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.858
- Not Bella Gardner, not if
he was locked up April 9th.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.947
- Check with Tallahassee PD.

22:19.990 --> 22:22.732
So what else do we have
on the other eight women?

22:22.776 --> 22:25.213
- There's no DNA on the kits.

22:25.256 --> 22:28.216
And he taped their eyes,
so there's no visual ID.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.696
- Let me talk to him
one-on-one.

22:29.739 --> 22:31.437
- He's not gonna confess
to the cop that shot at him.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.700
- He's not gonna
confess to anybody.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.702
He's a pro.
- Who made the mistake

22:35.745 --> 22:39.880
of saying the exact same phrase
to eight other women.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.490
<i>- Be a good girl.</i>

22:43.710 --> 22:46.887
- Number five.
- Be a good girl.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.371
-
Number five.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.589
I think.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.809
- You can take your time.

22:55.852 --> 22:59.421
-
Maybe four?

22:59.465 --> 23:00.857
- You went fishing.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.555
The big one got away.
We done?

23:02.598 --> 23:04.252
- I will let you know,
Counselor.

23:04.295 --> 23:06.428
- Okay, Rosie?

23:06.472 --> 23:08.909
- I'm sorry.

23:08.952 --> 23:11.651
It's not any of them.
- Okay.

23:11.694 --> 23:15.394
And now, we done?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.396
- Okay.
Thanks, Lieutenant.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.354
So that was Barek.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.661
The voice ID in the Bronx
went a little better.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.794
Five of seven
positively IDed Gonzalez.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.883
- The problem is,
three of the nine didn't,

23:26.927 --> 23:29.277
so he can claim reasonable
doubt on all of them.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.671
- And he has proof
that he didn't do one.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.282
Tallahassee PD confirms
that Gonzalez was locked up

23:34.325 --> 23:36.719
in county jail,
April 2nd to August 18th.

23:36.763 --> 23:39.418
- Okay, so he didn't rape
Bella Gardner on the 9th,

23:39.461 --> 23:41.855
but the M.O. was the same?
- No, not completely.

23:41.898 --> 23:43.987
Bella and Rosie both said
their assailant hardly spoke

23:44.031 --> 23:45.728
and had liquor on his breath.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.338
- So maybe it's a copycat.

23:47.382 --> 23:50.037
- Except that it wasn't
in the press, Kat.

23:53.388 --> 23:56.478
Okay, so for now,
let's go back to the assault

23:56.522 --> 23:59.568
in our jurisdiction--Rosie.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.918
Gonzalez had an alibi
for that night?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.791
- He was with his grandmother.
- Oh, the abuelita alibi.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.750
- It's not as airtight
as a lockup, but

24:07.794 --> 24:11.754
she and Bella had overlap
in their disclosures.

24:11.798 --> 24:13.016
Go back to Rosie.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.497
See if any of
the other details dovetail.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.502
- You never told me how it went
with Force Investigation.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.634
- No big deal.
I told them

24:21.677 --> 24:23.592
Moldovan said he saw a gun.

24:23.636 --> 24:24.854
- But you didn't?

24:24.898 --> 24:26.856
- I...I don't know.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.771
A lot was going on then.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.645
- Officers.
- Hey, Rosie.

24:32.688 --> 24:34.473
Sorry to bother you.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.779
We just had
some follow-up questions.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.912
- Oh, I'm--I'm already
answering them.

24:38.955 --> 24:41.001
Sergeant Moldovan got here
ahead of you.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.612
- Oh, okay, we must've
got our wires crossed.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.746
Can we come in?
- Yeah, of course.

24:49.792 --> 24:53.753
<i>♪</i>

24:53.796 --> 24:56.495
- Rollins, Tutuola.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
I should have given you
a heads-up.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.107
- What are you doing here?

25:00.150 --> 25:02.326
- Lieutenant Barek and I
decided it might be a good idea

25:02.370 --> 25:03.806
to go over
the victims' statements.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.852
- Sergeant Moldovan was
explaining that it's normal

25:05.895 --> 25:08.724
to be confused after a trauma.
- He was?

25:08.768 --> 25:11.988
- Which is why he wants me
to do the voice lineup again.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.990
That guy that you arrested--

25:14.034 --> 25:16.819
um, the one the dog bit?

25:16.863 --> 25:18.952
Yeah, I can pick him out
this time.

25:21.955 --> 25:24.131
I know I can.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.967
- I've gone over
Moldovan's record.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.229
Twenty years on the job,

25:35.272 --> 25:37.100
closed several
high-profile cases.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.450
Gun Hill Road Rapist,
the Black Hood Rapist.

25:39.494 --> 25:41.409
All his COs speak very highly.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.454
- Yeah, including
Lieutenant Barek.

25:43.498 --> 25:46.762
Look, I get it.
He's a good SVU investigator.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.591
- What I saw was
clear witness tampering.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.245
- Or overzealous police work.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.595
- He's been trying to push us
out of this case from the get.

25:53.639 --> 25:56.032
- He's turfy.
He's got an ego.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.512
What's Lieutenant Barek's take?

25:57.556 --> 26:00.123
- I held off on talking to her
until I talked to you.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.821
Look, it's gonna be
very difficult

26:01.864 --> 26:03.126
for us to work together
once I--

26:03.170 --> 26:05.172
- I get it.
So what's your gut?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.913
Gonzalez good
for these rapes?

26:06.956 --> 26:09.568
- Most of them,
but not all of them.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.961
Look, without a confession,

26:12.005 --> 26:14.137
without DNA, if we indict--

26:14.181 --> 26:16.400
- His defense attorney
has a field day.

26:16.444 --> 26:19.099
And that's before finding out
Moldovan was coaching a vic

26:19.142 --> 26:21.405
to make an ID.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.495
So we have a problem.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.410
- You still want me
to coordinate with Barek?

26:26.454 --> 26:28.064
- For the moment,
separate tracks.

26:28.108 --> 26:31.154
And first, discreetly find out
how much we need to worry

26:31.198 --> 26:33.592
about Moldovan's work
on the Bronx rapes.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.161
- Barek's gonna find out
sooner or later.

26:38.205 --> 26:41.251
- Yeah, and when she does,
she's gonna defend him.

26:41.295 --> 26:43.819
Look, and what
do we really have?

26:43.863 --> 26:46.387
He was re-interviewing
a victim.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.823
- Look, I could talk to him.

26:47.867 --> 26:49.564
I mean, Rollins didn't
just come out and say it,

26:49.608 --> 26:51.174
but from what I get,

26:51.218 --> 26:53.046
there was something off
about that shooting.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.482
- Look, you and Moldovan?

26:54.525 --> 26:57.224
What I don't need is a rematch.

26:57.267 --> 27:00.444
There's gotta be a less
confrontational way to do this.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.274
<i>- He says it'll just be
a minute.</i>

27:04.318 --> 27:07.103
- Cool.
- What were you saying?

27:07.147 --> 27:08.931
- Ari was the only male
I ever worked with

27:08.975 --> 27:10.585
who didn't hit on me.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.414
Even when he's had a couple.
He just taught me what he knew.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.329
- Must've felt like you were
thrown in the deep end

27:15.372 --> 27:17.200
when he went into quarantine.
-

27:17.244 --> 27:18.985
He was on the phone with me
every day.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.987
I mean, he was worried
I'd get the bug too.

27:21.030 --> 27:24.033
He even said, don't meet
Bella Gardner at the hospital.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.469
- Yeah, he was trying
to keep you safe.

27:25.513 --> 27:28.081
- Yeah, he said,
tell the vic to get a rape kit

27:28.124 --> 27:29.648
before you interview her
in person.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.041
Make sure you're not
exposing yourself.

27:32.085 --> 27:34.217
"Different times call
for different measures, Ruz.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.351
You gotta stay alive
to do good."

27:37.394 --> 27:39.701
- Sounds like he goes above
and beyond.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.660
- Yeah.
- Well, it's probably why

27:41.703 --> 27:44.532
he went back to Rosie's
after the voice ID.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.969
- He said she was shaken up.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.058
He blames himself for that one.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.277
- Why is that?

27:50.320 --> 27:52.148
- His one fault?

27:52.192 --> 27:55.282
Sometimes he gets so wound up,
he hits it hard end of shift.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.066
He was at an Inwood dive bar
that night.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.068
He called me to meet him.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.548
- Okay, ladies.
- Oh.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.071
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.377
- Later, he beat himself up

28:03.420 --> 28:05.031
'cause he was close
to the scene.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.990
I said, "Sarge, it's not like
you could've stopped it."

28:09.470 --> 28:12.560
- Hey, the blinds are drawn.
What's going on?

28:12.603 --> 28:14.910
- Moldovan was at a bar

28:14.954 --> 28:17.608
in the neighborhood
the night that Rosie was raped.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.349
- Ruz says that's why
he blames himself

28:19.393 --> 28:20.655
and why he went to Rosie.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.962
Because he cares--
- So much.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.268
- I don't like
where this is going.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.444
- Ruz trusts me.
I can go back to her.

28:27.488 --> 28:30.273
- Hold off for now.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.449
Thanks, Kat.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.496
And good job.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.329
Anyone think
this is a coincidence?

28:42.372 --> 28:45.245
- Bella and Rosie said
their rapist was quiet

28:45.288 --> 28:47.116
and had booze on his breath.
- And we know

28:47.160 --> 28:50.467
that Gonzalez is not good
for Bella's rape.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.166
- Rollins, one more time.

28:53.209 --> 28:57.126
When Moldovan shot
at Gonzalez...

28:57.170 --> 28:59.520

29:05.308 --> 29:07.267
Yeah.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.771
you admitted to four
of the six rapes,

30:16.815 --> 30:18.164
with your DNA.

30:18.207 --> 30:21.210
And then, two hours later,
you confessed to all six.

30:21.254 --> 30:24.431
- Including the final two
that didn't have any DNA.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.610
- Besides the cookies,
what's in it for me?

30:32.221 --> 30:34.397
All right, no one's
gonna believe me anyway.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.312
- If we can prove that
you were forced to confess

30:36.356 --> 30:38.227
to a crime that
you didn't commit,

30:38.271 --> 30:41.840
then I can tell the new Bronx
DA that you cooperated with us.

30:48.455 --> 30:51.284
- Okay.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.764
Moldovan's like a dog
with a bone,

30:53.808 --> 30:55.766
telling me to take the rap
for all six,

30:55.810 --> 30:57.768
and I save the two other women
from the anguish

30:57.812 --> 31:00.206
of blah-blah-blah.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.555
Like that's my problem.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.557
- Then why'd you confess?

31:03.600 --> 31:05.559
- Moldovan said he'd make sure

31:05.602 --> 31:07.691
I got locked up close to home.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.389
My mom was sick.

31:09.432 --> 31:11.608
She couldn't take
no eight-hour bus ride.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.656
So I cop to the six,

31:15.699 --> 31:18.659
and Moldovan opens his jaw,
drops me out.

31:21.401 --> 31:24.665
My mom passed a month later.

31:24.708 --> 31:26.754
She never came to see me once.

31:29.191 --> 31:32.151
So screw Moldovan.

31:39.158 --> 31:41.334
<i>- Moldovan's like a dog

31:41.377 --> 31:42.901

31:48.863 --> 31:51.648
So the Good Girl Rapist,
Black Hood Rapist--

31:51.692 --> 31:53.389
Sergeant Moldovan
takes on the M.O.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.783
of serial rapists
he's investigating?

31:55.826 --> 31:57.089
- There's no way
of knowing for sure.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.655
And there's no way
to prove any of this.

31:58.699 --> 32:02.181
- This guy is smart.
He left no DNA.

32:02.224 --> 32:04.400
I'm worried he's gonna find
some way to wiggle out of it

32:04.444 --> 32:06.185
and frame somebody else
as the copycat.

32:06.228 --> 32:08.187
- And all we have is the word
of a convicted rapist.

32:08.230 --> 32:10.798
So unless Moldovan confesses,
or he gets caught in the act,

32:10.841 --> 32:12.104
I-I don't see
how you make this case.

32:12.147 --> 32:14.280
- Well, his first mistake
was getting drunk

32:14.323 --> 32:16.673
and hitting Manhattan
instead of the Bronx.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.893
I mean, since we've been
working on this case,

32:18.937 --> 32:20.808
he's been losing control.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.766
Going at it with Fin,
shooting at Gonzalez.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.987
- So he's devolving, paranoid.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.207
Shouldn't be too hard
to speed that up.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.078
- Huh.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.039
<i>- Hey, Moldovan.</i>

32:34.082 --> 32:36.215
Thanks for meeting me.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.956
- What's going on?
You want a drink?

32:37.999 --> 32:39.870
- Oh, yeah.
I'll have what you're having.

32:43.396 --> 32:45.311
Hey, I'm getting a lot of heat.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.704
Gonzalez's lawyer
is threatening to sue.

32:47.748 --> 32:50.229
My captain and sergeant,
they're already in the barrel.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.013
- That guy in Central Park?
That case is bogus.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.754
- No, it's going forward,
and my captain says

32:53.797 --> 32:55.234
that there are a lot of eyes
on SVU.

32:55.277 --> 32:58.324
And she keeps asking me
about the gun--

32:58.367 --> 32:59.803
whether I saw it.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.154
- Listen, don't worry
about Gonzalez.

33:02.197 --> 33:03.503
Force Investigation?

33:03.546 --> 33:05.853
They won't take that pervert's
word over ours.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.420
- Hmm?

33:07.463 --> 33:10.162
- Unless you're
changing your story?

33:10.205 --> 33:12.773
- Mm-mm, no, no, no.
God, no.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.166
I talked to them once.
That's enough.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.124
- Then we're good.
- No, there's more.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.257
My sergeant didn't like you
showing up to Rosie's place.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.823
- Yeah, I got that.
- Yeah.

33:19.867 --> 33:21.825
So Rosie came in
to do the second voice ID,

33:21.869 --> 33:23.044
like you wanted her to.
- And?

33:23.088 --> 33:26.047
- She wasn't able
to ID Gonzalez.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.267
But we know it's him.
It's his M.O.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.095
- Your ADA is an ex-cop.
He'll indict, right?

33:30.138 --> 33:31.922
- Actually, there's
another flag on the play

33:31.966 --> 33:35.187
'cause Rosie told my sergeant
that she recognized your eyes.

33:35.230 --> 33:37.885
I told him that
you interviewed her twice.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.930
She was conflating.
- That can happen.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.715
- But the thing is,
you are already

33:41.758 --> 33:43.195
in my sergeant's crosshairs.

33:43.238 --> 33:46.024
He checked your cell records,
the night of the rape.

33:46.067 --> 33:49.114
- My cell records?

33:51.899 --> 33:54.075
So your sergeant's a rat?

33:54.119 --> 33:55.859
- I--
- What'd he find?

33:55.903 --> 33:57.731
My cell puts me in
the neighborhood the night of?

33:57.774 --> 33:59.863
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I was here.

33:59.907 --> 34:02.083
Didn't Officer Tamin tell you?
She talked to Ruz.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.215
- Yeah, she said
you felt guilty.

34:03.258 --> 34:06.348
- I did.
What I didn't say before?

34:06.392 --> 34:08.046
I saw Rosie here that night.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.091
She was partying hard.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.833
- She told us
she had a drink or two.

34:12.876 --> 34:15.749
- How many rape victims you
know tell you they were wasted?

34:15.792 --> 34:17.359
- That's why she didn't want
to go the hospital,

34:17.403 --> 34:19.361
get her blood alcohol run.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.407
- And now Rosie
makes me as the perp?

34:21.450 --> 34:23.800
I try to help her,
get this guy off the street,

34:23.844 --> 34:26.020
close it out?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.109
No good deed.
- No good deed.

34:28.153 --> 34:30.459
