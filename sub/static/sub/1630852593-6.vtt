00:09.920 --> 00:12.400
-<i>No, no, no!</i>
<i>-Hear, hear. Tony, for fuck's sake.</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:13.640
<i>It's just a discussion.</i>

00:13.720 --> 00:16.480
<i>Right. You say "God,"</i>
<i>but what do you think God is, exactly?</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:18.960
<i>I don't know what God is, exactly,</i>

00:19.040 --> 00:22.200
<i>but, you know, I-- I believe in something.</i>

00:22.280 --> 00:24.480
-<i>Vague. Very vague.</i>

00:24.560 --> 00:26.680
<i>Well, we obviously go somewhere.</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:28.120
<i>-I mean--</i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

00:28.200 --> 00:31.560
<i>Yeah, like, maybe heaven's, like,</i>
<i>just a peaceful dream or something.</i>

00:31.640 --> 00:33.160
<i>I don't know. You don't know.</i>

00:33.240 --> 00:35.760
<i>I'll probably end up in the other place.</i>

00:35.840 --> 00:40.360
<i>Hope so anyway. More fun.</i>
<i>You can drink and have it away down there.</i>

00:40.440 --> 00:43.760
<i> Yeah, but I'm not sure you'll enjoy</i>
<i>how you'll be having it away.</i>

00:43.840 --> 00:45.520
<i>Basically, you'll be Satan's bitch.</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:49.120
<i>What-- What will you say</i>
<i>when he's doing you from behind, Dad?</i>

00:50.400 --> 00:52.920
<i>-Gay.</i>
-<i>Yeah, that'll show him.</i>

01:09.880 --> 01:10.800
Good girl.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.560
Yeah.

01:14.920 --> 01:15.760
Here we go.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.360
Here we go.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.560
<i>It's her paw-tograph.</i>

03:04.560 --> 03:05.400
Cheers.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.440
-Did Brian have a word?
-Yeah, yeah, he did. Yeah.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.560
-Good.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.680
Yeah, he said I should stop being
a worthless slug, and I should be a man.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.960
Yeah. Yeah, so I gave Roxy
an ultimatum, didn't I?

03:17.040 --> 03:19.400
I said it's either being a prossie
or being with me.

03:20.120 --> 03:20.960
Right.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.480
-She chose being a prossie.
-Oh.

03:23.560 --> 03:24.880
Obviously.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.360
-Sorry about that.
-Yeah.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.640
So, uh, I'm young, free, and single again.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.440
So I was wondering

03:34.040 --> 03:38.560
do you fancy
going on the pull sometime together?

03:41.400 --> 03:42.880
-No, fair enough.
-See ya later.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.200
-See ya.
-Cheers.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.200
Oh, hello.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.480
Hello. Um, I just want you
to have a copy of the paper.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.640
Oh.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.120
Look at my silly face!

04:15.680 --> 04:16.960
"That takes the biscuit."

04:17.560 --> 04:20.960
Ooh. It's lovely.
Would you like a cup of tea?

04:21.040 --> 04:23.160
I won't, thanks.
But can I just use your toilet?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.200
Yes, straight through
the kitchen by the back door.

04:25.280 --> 04:26.840
Thank you. Won't be a second.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.160
Oh.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.200
What are you doing?

04:37.200 --> 04:38.480
Uh, you know, just, um,

04:39.960 --> 04:41.160
leaving this photo.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.880
It's me and Lisa when we were kids.
I never got round to it before.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.240
I know this is sort of your place.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.120
I thought you were
checking out a good spot

04:51.200 --> 04:52.880
'cause of your really weak heart.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.920
-Brilliant.
-Cheers.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.760
It's okay to admit
that you're a nice bloke, you know, Tony.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.320
-It's not a weakness.
-Right.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.240
I think,

05:14.480 --> 05:17.040
in your own way, you've always cared.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.160
You've always wanted people
to feel better and happier.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.320
You just really enjoyed

05:25.080 --> 05:25.920
poking them

05:26.520 --> 05:27.880
until they start thinking.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.120
If it didn't kill them,
you made them stronger.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.560
I'm like an inoculation.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.200
More like the actual annoying virus.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.640
Yeah.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.840
-Good.
-See you later.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.200
-See you later.
-Don't be late for work.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.760
I definitely will be late.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.640
I know.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.680
-Hello.
-Hello.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.480
-I beat you here today.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.480
Oh, what's that?

06:07.360 --> 06:10.960
It's Lisa and her little brother
when they were kids.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.880
-Oh.
-He just left it there.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.280
How did you meet Stan?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.640
I was on holiday with my mum.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.600
Hmm.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.560
It was a caravan park,
and we met in the club room at a dance.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.800
And then we went for dinner.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.400
And he told me a rude joke,
and I didn't laugh,

06:33.480 --> 06:34.960
and it made him feel bad.

06:37.160 --> 06:40.640
Fifty years later,
it still eats me up that I didn't laugh.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
What was the joke?

06:43.720 --> 06:47.080
What's the difference between
a Rolls-Royce and a dead prostitute?

06:47.720 --> 06:48.800
Dunno.

06:50.120 --> 06:52.880
-I haven't got a Rolls-Royce in my garage.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.080
Oh, good old Stan.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.520
I wish I'd laughed.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.720
I'm sure he never gave it
a second thought.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.680
No, you're probably right.

07:06.040 --> 07:09.880
What's that, uh, Mark Twain quotation?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.000
"I've had a lot of worries in my life,
most of which have never happened."

07:15.800 --> 07:16.640
Yeah.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.600
How did you meet Lisa?

07:19.760 --> 07:20.720
Uh--

07:21.400 --> 07:23.480
Uh, it was the early '90s.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.440
Um,

07:25.520 --> 07:27.480
I thought I was a writer,

07:27.560 --> 07:30.440
but I was actually on the dole,
telling people I was a writer.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.120
Lisa was an artist.

07:33.880 --> 07:38.200
Fresh out of college. And she had
a little exhibition at the Tambury Fair.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.880
And I was looking round, mainly at her,

07:41.920 --> 07:45.640
and, uh, she thought
I was interested in one of her works.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.760
So I said I'd like to buy it.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.960
And she said, uh,
"How would you like to pay?"

07:53.880 --> 07:56.600
-And I thought, "Good question. I can't."

07:57.200 --> 07:58.160
So I said, uh,

07:58.960 --> 08:03.400
"I could marry you and pay you back
by doing odd jobs around the house."

08:04.480 --> 08:07.280
And, uh, then I just said,
"I haven't got any money."

08:07.800 --> 08:10.640
-She went, "What, on you?"
-I went, "No. At all."

08:11.320 --> 08:14.440
And she realized
it was her I was interested in,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.200
and she said, um,

08:16.880 --> 08:18.480
"So I have to buy <i>you </i>dinner?"

08:19.000 --> 08:19.960
And that was it.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.000
We went out, and, uh, we hit it off.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.200
We talked about music and stuff.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.920
Our love of David Bowie

08:30.760 --> 08:31.960
and Joni Mitchell.

08:32.040 --> 08:33.520
-That was her favorite.
-Hmm.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.680
We even played, um,
"Both Sides Now" at the wedding.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.520
And I just thought
I was the luckiest man in the world.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.760
I wish I hadn't teased her about there
not being an afterlife now because, uh,

08:54.920 --> 08:57.560
I think she wanted to believe, deep down,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.920
in, like, Heaven and angels and stuff.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.080
I hope she wasn't--

09:05.040 --> 09:06.440
I hope she wasn't scared.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.960
All she'd have wanted
was you with her at the end.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.640
Oh, and there are angels by the way.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.920
They don't have wings and live in clouds.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
They wear nurse's uniforms and work hard
to pay the rent on their houses.

09:29.240 --> 09:33.040
Some work for charities
because they can't look the other way.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.640
Some have four legs and bark.

09:39.200 --> 09:42.240
But whatever they look like,
they all save lives.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.880
Sometimes you bump into them.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.920
Like Lisa.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.440
And Stan. And you-- And you marry them.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.920
I know that Lisa and Stan
aren't angels now. But they were.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.480
If you want to be an angel,
you've got to do it when you're alive.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.160
Be good. Do good things.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.120
Introduce a lonely woman to a nice man.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.240
Hmm.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.760
You're my angel, Tony.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.480
-Not sure about that.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.360
So,

10:38.160 --> 10:40.040
why did you shave your head?

10:40.120 --> 10:44.280
Because my sister's hair fell out
when she was getting rid of the cancer.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.720
And now we look the same again.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.320
You do.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.160
-Why do you want to look like your sister?
-Because she's lovely.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.840
She is. And I think you're lovely too.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.920
She got sponsored
and raised £1,200 to help me.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.560
Amazing, £1,200. Wow.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.280
Well, I need your names
to put 'em in the paper

11:09.360 --> 11:11.880
so everyone knows how brilliant you are.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.600
-I'm Milly.
-Milly.

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
I'm Lisa.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.480
Lisa.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.320
My wife's name.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.160
Where is she?

11:31.200 --> 11:32.880
She's at home.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.000
-Making your tea?
-Yeah.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.960
-Why are you crying?
-Because I'm happy.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.720
-Why are you crying if you're happy?
-Because I'm mental.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.960
Can we take a picture?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.120
Smile.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.040
Brilliant.

11:54.120 --> 11:54.960
That's it.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.040
Thank you. Bye-bye.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.440
Are you having chemo?

12:02.520 --> 12:04.240
-No.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.720
His hair fell out 'cause he ate nothing
but crisps and biscuits for 30 years.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.960
I wish I could just eat those.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.560
Yeah, but this way,
your hair will grow back.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.080
But Lenny will just keep getting
balder and balder,

12:19.160 --> 12:21.200
and that's not even
his worst characteristic.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.040
Do you think he looks like Shrek?

12:23.120 --> 12:25.320
-He's your friend though.
-He is.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.360
He is. And it doesn't matter
what you look like.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.440
It's what's on the inside that matters.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.240
And as we all know, what's inside Lenny

12:34.320 --> 12:36.640
is just loads of crisps and biscuits.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.760
Will you come again?

12:41.440 --> 12:42.560
I don't know.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.040
Okay.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.680
-Why do you ask?
-You're funny.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.800
Am I?

12:50.440 --> 12:51.400
Um--

12:51.480 --> 12:53.760
Okay, I'll-- I'll pop in and say hello.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.720
Tomorrow?

12:56.760 --> 12:58.280
-All right.
-And the day after?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.800
I'll come in every day
until you're better.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.840
Or until I go to Heaven?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.160
Do you believe in Heaven?

13:18.000 --> 13:18.840
Definitely.

13:24.840 --> 13:25.680
<i>It's me again.</i>

13:26.680 --> 13:28.640
<i>Running out of things to say,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

13:29.160 --> 13:32.360
<i>Found a poem that says what I want to say.</i>

13:34.480 --> 13:36.520
<i>"Do not stand at my grave and weep"</i>

13:37.640 --> 13:40.280
<i>"I am not there, I do not sleep"</i>

13:41.080 --> 13:43.360
<i>"I am a thousand winds that blow"</i>

13:43.440 --> 13:45.320
<i>"I am the diamond glints on snow"</i>

13:46.440 --> 13:48.600
<i>"I am the sunlight on ripened grain"</i>

13:49.200 --> 13:50.960
<i>"I am the gentle autumn's rain"</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:54.760
<i>"When you awaken in the morning's hush"</i>

13:55.320 --> 13:57.400
<i>"I am the swift, uplifting rush</i>

13:58.000 --> 14:00.320
<i>"Of quiet birds in circled flight"</i>

14:01.400 --> 14:03.480
<i>"I am the soft starshine at night"</i>

14:05.840 --> 14:08.120
<i>"Do not stand at my grave and cry"</i>

14:09.840 --> 14:10.800
<i>"I am not there"</i>

14:11.400 --> 14:12.400
<i>"I did not die"</i>

14:16.360 --> 14:17.840
<i>I want you to enjoy life.</i>

14:18.720 --> 14:19.600
<i>Mm.</i>

14:20.120 --> 14:24.840
<i>I don't want you to worry about money or--</i>
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

14:26.080 --> 14:28.280
<i>Just worry about you, yeah? Be--</i>

14:29.120 --> 14:30.040
<i>Be happy.</i>

14:31.680 --> 14:32.640
<i>And be kind.</i>

14:34.600 --> 14:35.440
<i>Be Tony.</i>

14:49.520 --> 14:50.360
What's this?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.320
Oh, no, Tony, I can't accept this.

14:56.400 --> 14:57.600
She was your sister.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.760
-I know, but--
-You lost her too.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.320
I thought not caring was a superpower.
I was wrong.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.040
Caring about stuff,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.200
that's what really matters.

15:09.720 --> 15:13.120
Kindness. Making other people feel good.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.440
That's the real superpower.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.360
And we've all got it.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.240
Sometimes,

15:21.200 --> 15:22.040
I feel happy.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.080
Not happy like normal people,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.320
or like I used to

15:27.360 --> 15:31.600
feel happy when I didn't appreciate it,
but content, you know?

15:32.160 --> 15:37.000
A sort of feeling washes over me
like the world's all right.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.200
In fact, life's pretty fucking amazing.

15:39.280 --> 15:44.120
You know, I think how lucky was I
to exist at the same time as Lisa?

15:44.800 --> 15:46.400
Spend all my time with her.

15:46.920 --> 15:47.760
All my love.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.680
Then it all comes crashing down,
and I remember she died, and I'm alone.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.360
I can't wait to die.

15:57.760 --> 16:01.480
It all happens in seconds,
and constant, you know?

16:02.080 --> 16:04.200
And then today, at the hospice,

16:05.960 --> 16:07.080
I met a little kid.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.560
So sweet and innocent.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.000
And all my own troubles…

16:17.800 --> 16:18.840
are put on hold.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.240
They were still there, but

16:21.520 --> 16:23.440
he became my troubles, you know?

16:24.160 --> 16:27.560
And, uh, it sort of stopped the cycle,

16:28.320 --> 16:30.480
the descent into darkness,

16:31.280 --> 16:32.400
because I had a cause.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.360
It's like

16:37.120 --> 16:38.960
if the kid lives, then so do I.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.000
Thank you.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.720
Wedding present.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.360
Fucking hell. Are you sure?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.480
That is so kind.

16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
You all right, Kath?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.800
Yeah. Yeah.
Going to laughter yoga tonight.

17:02.800 --> 17:06.080
That's where I am now.
Going to a class to learn how to smile.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.760
That's to help you get a better flat.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.160
-Well, thank you.
-No worries.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.320
Sorry, I just--
Nothing like this ever happens.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.080
Okay, everybody, so we've got a new member
today. What's your name?

18:18.160 --> 18:21.480
-Kath.
-Kath. Okay, Kath, so just loosen up.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.800
Get those funny bones shaking.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.280
Okay.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.280
And big smiles, yeah?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.680
Yeah.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.520
-Love life.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.240
Feel those endorphins. Yeah?

18:42.840 --> 18:45.120
Funny old world. Funny old world.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.040
Sorry, hold on, everyone.
Can we just-- From you?

19:00.920 --> 19:02.200
I'm so lonely.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.840
I think you'd better leave 'cause
you're bringing the whole vibe down.

20:14.000 --> 20:14.880
Oh!

20:14.960 --> 20:16.200
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.400
Uh, this is Jack.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.320
-Hi.
-Hello.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.760
And this is Tony.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.320
My friend.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.680
Always.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.640
-Nice to meet ya.
-Yeah, likewise.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.680
-See ya later.
-See you.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.600
Come on.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.920
-Yes! Well done!

21:02.160 --> 21:03.000
Hi.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.400
Oh. You okay?

21:06.480 --> 21:07.360
Yeah.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.880
More than okay.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.080
Oh, good.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.680
I couldn't stand to lose
another wonderful man.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.440
Oh, and by the way, uh,

21:19.720 --> 21:21.920
-thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.280
My pleasure.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.000
See ya later. Come on, girl.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.520
"Dr. Barnaby flung open
the operating theater doors."

21:31.200 --> 21:32.480
"As he walked down the corridor,

21:32.560 --> 21:35.760
he saw a pretty, young
Afro-Caribbean nurse crying."

21:36.360 --> 21:38.840
"She'd straightened her hair
so looked like Beyoncé."

21:39.840 --> 21:42.280
"'What's the matter, Nurse?
Why do you cry?'"

21:42.800 --> 21:44.080
"'Racism, Doctor.'"

21:45.720 --> 21:46.600
"'Racism?'"

21:47.520 --> 21:48.600
"'I hate racism.'"

21:49.360 --> 21:52.520
"'I think we are all equal,
and I judge people by their character

21:52.600 --> 21:54.200
and not whether they're colored or not.'"

21:55.640 --> 21:59.080
"'I made love to a Chinese lady once.
Beautiful eyes.'"

21:59.160 --> 22:00.280
I love this.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.280
What, the fair?

22:02.880 --> 22:04.880
Everyone comes together for a few hours.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.840
They swap ideas and recipes and junk,

22:07.920 --> 22:10.400
and they create memories and photos.

22:11.800 --> 22:14.080
My dad used to say
life's like a ride at the fair.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.360
Exciting, scary, fast.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.840
And you can only go round once.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.880
You have the best time
till you can't take any more.

22:23.400 --> 22:27.200
Then it slows down, and you see
someone else waiting to get on.

22:28.320 --> 22:29.440
They need your seat.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.120
-Hey, happy Christmas, son!
-Mind out!

22:52.200 --> 22:53.880
Okay, guys, please, it's for kids.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.640
-Boom! Balls deep!
-Pick on someone your own size!

22:56.720 --> 22:58.600
-You get in, then! Get it!
-That 's not--

22:58.680 --> 23:01.400
You jump in.
We'll do it in front of your son!

23:01.480 --> 23:04.200
-That's not what I meant.
-Show how weak you are.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.920
Your child. Do it! Do it! Do it!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.800
Come on. Go on, big man.

23:07.880 --> 23:08.760
Ah! Ah!

23:08.840 --> 23:11.200
-Wanna do this in front of your kid?
-Hey.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.920
-That was too close.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.480
That's--

23:15.920 --> 23:18.760
-Oh!
-Prat!

23:18.840 --> 23:21.160
"Oh,
you're good at football, aren't you?"

23:24.400 --> 23:25.480
Oh, I was rubbish.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.720
I don't think
sticking up for someone's rubbish.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.040
-Do you, George?
-No.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.480
My hero.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.560
And you saved one.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.800
-I did save one.
-You definitely saved one, didn't he?

23:34.880 --> 23:36.760
-Daddy's really good at football.
-With my bum.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.080
Hey. Remember me?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.480
Oh, yeah. Dog shit man.

23:42.560 --> 23:44.360
Oh, Marvel missed a trick there.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.160
-You still refuse to have a relationship?
-No.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.400
No, I changed my mind. I'm desperate now.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.200
I'm here on the pull. No offense.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.800
And not with you either.
No, no. You're out of my league.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.560
I'm not being sexist, but, you know--

23:57.640 --> 24:00.160
-Well, you're saying all the right things.
-Really?

24:00.240 --> 24:01.280
Absolutely.

24:01.920 --> 24:05.520
Desperation, flattery, begging.
I mean, what's not to love?

24:06.720 --> 24:08.640
Well, I don't know what to say.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.160
I'll be honest with you. I lost my mojo
over the last year and a half.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.320
But I'm over the moon that a woman
of your class, well, any woman, really,

24:17.400 --> 24:18.960
would consider doing it with me.

24:19.040 --> 24:19.880
But you need--

24:21.360 --> 24:24.320
You need to know
I'm not the stallion I once was, you know.

24:24.400 --> 24:25.480
Oh, I get the urge.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.840
I think,
"Ooh, let's have a bit of me time."

24:27.920 --> 24:29.520
I go upstairs and close the curtains.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.560
Harry the five-legged spider,
he comes out to play.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.560
After a couple of minutes, I think,
"Nah, can't be bothered with this."

24:36.640 --> 24:40.760
I remember the slice of mature cheddar
and crusty cob I got downstairs, you know.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.720
-Is this foreplay?
-Hey.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.960
-No strings attached now.
-No.

24:45.560 --> 24:49.280
Oh. Just dirty, sweaty, ugly sex.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.080
Well, I'm your man, then.
In fact, I'm sweating already.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.040
-And you're ugly.
-I got feelings as well though.

24:54.640 --> 24:55.480
All right?

24:57.600 --> 24:58.920
-See ya later.
-See ya.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.960
-So what sort of sex do you like?
-Quick.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.320
-Quick?
-Yeah.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.240
Go on.

25:05.320 --> 25:08.160
Nearly. Better luck next time. Farewell!

25:08.240 --> 25:09.280
See you later, buddy.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.320
Everyone seems to be having fun.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.360
-Yeah, lovely day out, innit?
-It really is.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.800
Here he is. Knobby the Dickhead Elf.
What you come as?

25:17.400 --> 25:18.480
-A jester.
-Jester?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.120
More like a fucking molester.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.360
-Jester Molester!

25:21.440 --> 25:23.440
Fucking Santa's little cunt.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.240
-Leave him alone, mate.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.040
Oh.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.320
Kiddy-fiddler on the roof's piped up,
inn't he?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.760
Fucking hell.
You're telling us to leave kids alone?

25:31.840 --> 25:35.360
-You should've left them alone.
-You little fucking nuisance.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.520
-You pig!
-You nuisance.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.840
Listen, stick your arse
in his face, Nonce. Go on.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.920
-No, don't stick your arse--
-Look at this. Human centipede!

25:42.000 --> 25:45.840
Listen, I'll get 'round here and bum him,
turn him into a fucking human bentipede.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.360
Oh, he likes that.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.360
Clean that up. You hungry?
I had sweetcorn for lunch.

25:50.440 --> 25:53.640
-Really? I wish I was dead.
-I wish you were dead and all, darlin'.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.160
Fucking hell. Show us your feet.
I'm almost there.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.400
That's enough, boys. Leave him alone.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.640
Fucking hell.
It's fucking dumb and dumber, innit?

26:02.720 --> 26:03.560
Come again, mush?

26:03.640 --> 26:06.560
Fuck it. They got buy one, get ten free
on the fucking doughnuts, hey, son?

26:07.720 --> 26:08.960
-Ooh.

26:12.440 --> 26:13.920
You bring it on yourself.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.840
Bloody hell, that's awful.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.320
Got it.

26:27.040 --> 26:27.880
Thank you.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.240
Time and again
throughout my miserable life,

26:31.320 --> 26:33.600
I thought I'd reached my lowest ebb.
I never have.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.160
Ah.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.960
Thousands of times I've thought,
"The only way is up." Nope.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.560
"Wrong again, Brian.
We've got a surprise for you."

26:46.680 --> 26:50.480
Surely giving the assistant manager
of Tambury FC a blow job in a car park

26:52.080 --> 26:53.800
is the depth of depravity?

26:53.880 --> 26:54.960
No.

26:57.080 --> 26:58.000
Getting bummed

26:59.560 --> 27:03.000
in front of my ex-wife
and the whole town is.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.640
And then Micky the Gypsy comes in,
who's actually shagging my ex-wife,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.320
and he saves the day.

27:13.920 --> 27:14.880
Tell me a joke.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.080
Why did the little girl
fall off the swing?

27:24.720 --> 27:26.520
-Dunno.
-She had no arms.

27:30.080 --> 27:31.240
That's-- That was funny.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.360
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.160
Oh, cheers.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.000
You've got, like,

27:39.200 --> 27:40.320
shit on you.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.920
-Um, yeah.
-Tomato.

27:42.000 --> 27:42.920
Yeah.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.920
-Do you want to get a coffee?
-Yeah.

27:50.080 --> 27:50.920
Yeah.

27:51.000 --> 27:51.840
I'll pay.

27:52.680 --> 27:53.920
-Good.
-Come on, then.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.120
-Okay.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.280
-Are they nice?
-What do you mean?

28:02.360 --> 28:04.000
Well, they're not here 'cause they're bad?

28:04.080 --> 28:06.160
There are no bad dogs, just bad owners.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.040
You like having a dog, don't you?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.040
She saved my life.

28:13.760 --> 28:14.840
She knows when I'm sad.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.560
I mean, I'm always sad,
so it's hard for her to be wrong, but--

28:19.640 --> 28:21.200
At night, when I'm drinking,

28:22.560 --> 28:23.640
she's right there,

28:24.720 --> 28:25.560
on duty.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.520
She recognizes Lisa on video as well.

28:31.440 --> 28:35.920
And we sit there missing her,
but at least we're missing her together.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.480
I don't believe in a soul, but

28:41.040 --> 28:43.600
if there is such a thing,
dogs have got one.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.000
-Oh.
-Oh. He likes you.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.800
-Does he?
-Oh yeah.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.680
Can I keep him?

28:54.640 --> 28:55.800
Well, yeah.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.240
Pending a home visit and a few details.

29:00.520 --> 29:01.360
I'll do it.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.920
Um, is she all right? She's not unstable?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.080
Just a bit lonely.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.160
We just need to make sure
the dog goes to a good home.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.280
She's fine. Remember,
there are no bad dogs, just bad owners.

29:15.360 --> 29:19.760
If you treat a dog bad and show 'em
no love, that's what they act like.

29:20.440 --> 29:23.280
If you show 'em kindness
and hope, they're fine.

29:24.280 --> 29:27.360
-It's the same with people.
-What do they eat?

29:28.360 --> 29:32.840
Anything. Slippers, sticks, toys, vomit.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.040
And dog food.

29:36.840 --> 29:37.680
It's easy.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.400
All right?

29:41.240 --> 29:42.800
-Hiya.
-What are you up to?

29:43.480 --> 29:44.840
Kath's adopting a dog.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.640
-Dogs don't usually like me.
-Why?

29:49.720 --> 29:52.000
-Well, my job.
-What's your job?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.200
Postman.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.160
Oh.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.640
-You?
-I sell advertising.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.560
Oh, nice.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.320
So…

30:07.960 --> 30:10.080
I'll, uh, see you later.

30:10.160 --> 30:11.480
-See you.
-See ya.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.760
<i>-You come in too!</i>

31:53.280 --> 31:55.200
<i>Come in, Tony!</i>

32:09.720 --> 32:11.960
-Tony!

32:12.040 --> 32:14.640
-Smile.
