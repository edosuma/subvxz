01:51.920 --> 01:54.080
MY MOM AND ME

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
No.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.800
That's not what
I have planned for you.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.360
Did you get any warning,
any threats or messages?

03:11.480 --> 03:12.680
Nothing.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.920
You're sure they only accessed
the monkey enclosure?

03:17.280 --> 03:18.440
That's right.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.240
-Yes, what is it?
-We have all the monkeys.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.720
I see it.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.920
What are you doing
up at this time?

04:30.120 --> 04:33.040
I can't sleep and I couldn't
just lay in bed anymore.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.040
Welcome to the world
of insomnia.

04:36.840 --> 04:39.760
Why can't you sleep?
Are you worried about something?

04:40.400 --> 04:41.400
Everything.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.160
What about you?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
Is it a boy?

04:48.040 --> 04:49.800
Do you believe
in second chances?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.120
Watch out, you may get let down
a second time.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.120
So, what's his name?

04:57.160 --> 04:59.360
No, I mean someone who...

04:59.520 --> 05:02.000
did something wrong,
or made a mistake.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.960
What kind of mistake?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.040
I don't know...

05:09.160 --> 05:13.160
like a thief, or murderer,
or a rapist, perhaps.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.080
It depends.
Some don't deserve it.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.360
So, some do?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.000
If there is true remorse,

05:24.280 --> 05:26.760
if they recognize
what they did was wrong,

05:28.200 --> 05:29.760
if they apologize

05:30.480 --> 05:33.000
and promise never
to do it again, then...

05:34.880 --> 05:36.960
then yes, maybe they do.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.040
And... what if they were ill
but now they're cured?

05:42.840 --> 05:43.960
Then what?

05:44.120 --> 05:46.040
That would have to be assessed,
but...

05:48.400 --> 05:51.600
there's always another side
to every case.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.080
What other side?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.240
The victim.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Hey...

06:02.680 --> 06:03.960
what's this all about?

06:05.720 --> 06:08.040
No, nothing,
it's just for ethics class.

06:08.920 --> 06:09.920
Right.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.120
Ethics class.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.040
That's why you can't sleep?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.680
Have you come
to any conclusions?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.200
No, not yet.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.720
I'll put a pot of coffee on.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.120
Sol.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.000
It's good to think this way,
you could put it into practice.

06:33.440 --> 06:34.440
How?

06:35.280 --> 06:36.520
With your mom.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.960
If anyone deserves
a second chance, it's her.

06:41.640 --> 06:42.640
Will you?

06:45.160 --> 06:49.080
If she starts treating me
like an adult... maybe I will.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.800
These cameras are covered
like the ones at the entrance.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.880
There must be more
between here and there.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.040
Yeah, the whole place
has extensive surveillance.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.240
If we're lucky,
he'll have missed one.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.040
We'll need all the footage.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.000
Shine the light over here.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
What's this?

07:51.960 --> 07:55.000
-No idea. It shouldn't be there.
-Why not?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.120
The whole place gets cleaned
when the visitors leave.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.200
We'll need a list of the staff
on night-shift for questioning.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.080
I'll see if I can get that now.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.880
Put your damn phone on silent,
Abaño.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.120
Sorry.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.280
You're kidding me.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.240
What's wrong?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.480
This is in the station chat.

09:44.640 --> 09:45.640
Hi.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.920
-Our colleague...
-She's coming.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
-Morning.
-Hello.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.440
-Don't show her.
-What is it?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.440
Something else about me
in the media?

10:00.560 --> 10:02.960
What a drag... Can I see?
Let's see.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
Isabel.

10:20.840 --> 10:21.920
You're a bastard.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.040
What?

10:23.040 --> 10:23.080
What?
-You son of a...
-What do you mean?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.320
-You son of a...
-What do you mean?

10:25.440 --> 10:27.000
-Why would you do this?
-Do what?

10:27.000 --> 10:27.040
-Why would you do this?
-Do what?
Why? You're the only one
who's ever been in my bed.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.120
Why? You're the only one
who's ever been in my bed.

10:31.120 --> 10:31.160
Why? You're the only one
who's ever been in my bed.
-Is that why you came?
-What?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.640
-Is that why you came?
-What?

10:32.760 --> 10:34.040
You wanted to get back at me?

10:34.040 --> 10:34.080
You wanted to get back at me?
-For what I did years ago.
-Are you crazy?

10:34.080 --> 10:36.120
-For what I did years ago.
-Are you crazy?

10:36.240 --> 10:38.000
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

10:38.160 --> 10:40.720
-I'd never do that.
-I trusted you.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.120
-I believed in you.
-It wasn't me, it was you.

10:44.120 --> 10:44.160
-I believed in you.
-It wasn't me, it was you.
-Me? Are you crazy?
-The photo came from your phone.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.200
-Me? Are you crazy?
-The photo came from your phone.

10:47.360 --> 10:51.160
-That's a lie.
-You took the photo and sent it.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.960
I need this phone fingerprinted.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.080
-It'll take a few days.
-I need it now.

11:19.080 --> 11:19.120
-It'll take a few days.
-I need it now.
Identifying prints takes time.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.880
Identifying prints takes time.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.800
You don't have
to identify them all.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.120
I just want someone specific.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.160
Who?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.680
Nieto.

11:48.560 --> 11:49.560
LABORATORY

11:58.120 --> 11:59.000
Are they on there?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Only yours.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.760
PROTECTION

12:17.920 --> 12:19.160
JUSTICE

12:38.200 --> 12:41.960
They're killing us like dogs
while those bastards do nothing.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.280
-We have to get organized.
-How?

12:44.480 --> 12:47.480
By knowing where we are,
so we can protect each other.

12:47.640 --> 12:51.680
It'd be good to get everyone's
home and work address,

12:51.800 --> 12:54.080
-everyone's, for safety reasons.
-Good plan.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.800
-Yeah?
-I live with my mom.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.160
-Will you write?
-Yes.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.560
-Let's go!
-Come on!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.760
Javi! It's getting real.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.400
Call for backup, now!

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
Help!

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
Watch out!

13:39.400 --> 13:41.080
Javi!

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
Violence has broken out.
It's chaos down here.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.520
As we speak, the ex-cons
are being viciously attacked

13:52.680 --> 13:54.840
and the police are powerless
to stop it.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.800
Let go.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.120
Javi, the camera, dammit!

14:14.240 --> 14:15.480
Get up!

14:15.680 --> 14:18.200
-Get the hell out of here!
-I'm working, dammit!

14:18.400 --> 14:20.120
Go on, get out of here.

14:20.280 --> 14:21.280
Move!

14:22.600 --> 14:23.600
Get out of here!

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
Javi!

14:32.440 --> 14:33.440
THEY'RE KILLING US

14:54.960 --> 14:56.880
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

15:06.240 --> 15:07.360
Alright!

15:26.360 --> 15:28.120
-Coke? Smack?
-No.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.360
I'm looking
for something special.

15:31.960 --> 15:32.960
A real delicacy.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.120
For someone special.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.240
The specialties are in there.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.520
If my car's in perfect condition
when I get out,

15:46.720 --> 15:48.000
you get the other half.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.600
If not,
I'll slice you open like a pig.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.440
As we speak, the ex-cons are
being viciously attacked

16:03.560 --> 16:05.720
and the police
are powerless to stop it.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.160
This is absolute chaos.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.160
ALL-OUT WAR IN PAROT CASE

16:12.360 --> 16:13.520
Get out of here!

16:19.800 --> 16:21.400
This is becoming harassment.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.120
My son...

16:27.240 --> 16:29.040
is Julián López de Haro.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.320
I'm sorry I didn't say anything
but, please, if you'd just...

16:38.480 --> 16:40.640
I don't want to hear it
and I don't have to,

16:40.760 --> 16:41.960
so please just leave.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.760
I get this is tough
for both of us.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.280
-You get it?
-Yes, listen.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.920
I know you're struggling,

16:47.080 --> 16:49.320
but I've had no life
since I learned about my son.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.160
This isn't some contest
to see who has it worse.

16:52.320 --> 16:54.120
I don't care
what you're going through.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.880
-But I need you...
-I don't care what you need.

16:57.040 --> 16:59.560
I'm not here as your therapist
or to understand you.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.960
Nor to help you sleep at night.
Your son ruined our lives.

17:04.160 --> 17:07.040
So... you do think
I'm to blame?

17:07.040 --> 17:07.120
So... you do think
I'm to blame?
I don't care,
all I care about is my daughter.

17:07.120 --> 17:09.480
I don't care,
all I care about is my daughter.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.120
That's why I'm here,
to apologize on his behalf.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.040
That has to come from him,

17:14.040 --> 17:14.080
That has to come from him,
but he's never shown remorse
and never will,

17:14.080 --> 17:16.320
but he's never shown remorse
and never will,

17:16.480 --> 17:19.360
-because he's a monster.
-I know. I know.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.160
What's your plan?
Apologize to each and every one

17:22.320 --> 17:23.960
of the girls he raped?

17:27.000 --> 17:28.200
I'll do what I have to.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.160
Whether I like it or not,
I'm his dad.

17:31.800 --> 17:34.080
-You're a mother. You know...
-I don't want

17:34.200 --> 17:37.080
to put myself in your shoes
or empathize with you.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
I can't.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.160
What a job, crappy pay
and no appreciation.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.400
Incredible.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.720
Those guys in Strasbourg
don't care about the aftermath.

17:57.960 --> 17:58.960
Excuse me.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.120
You're the administrator
of the station chat, right?

18:02.240 --> 18:04.760
Yes? Please
delete my photo.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.440
Make sure there's no trace.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.880
-Alright.
-Thank you.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.280
What's this?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.240
We found it
at the zoo last night.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.000
Nieto's trying to work out
what it is.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.240
I know what it is.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.800
It's a badge from La Alameda.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.360
It's a residence
and occupational therapy center.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.520
-How do you know?
-I volunteered there one summer.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.000
I have some at home.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.120
I felt pretty dumb there
for a minute.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.560
Hey, that happens
to me a lot recently.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.040
-Right.
-Do you have the case file?

18:35.040 --> 18:35.080
-Right.
-Do you have the case file?
-I took it to Archives.
-I'll grab it and we'll go.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.920
-I took it to Archives.
-I'll grab it and we'll go.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.400
Nieto.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.640
That badge is from
an occupational therapy center

18:47.760 --> 18:50.240
-called La Alameda.
-How do you know?

18:50.760 --> 18:51.880
Isabel told me.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.680
-Let's go.
-Shouldn't we wait for her?

18:57.200 --> 18:58.320
Goddammit... Nieto.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.080
-Yes?
-It's the manager.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.480
I saw you come in.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.800
What do you want?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.120
Be out of here
tomorrow before twelve.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.120
And don't be taking the towels,
I count them.

19:44.120 --> 19:44.160
And don't be taking the towels,
I count them.
What the hell?
Why are you kicking me out?

19:44.160 --> 19:46.120
What the hell?
Why are you kicking me out?

19:46.880 --> 19:49.120
Looks like your friend
got tired of paying.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.280
-Your free ride's up, buddy.
-Excuse me?

19:52.960 --> 19:54.760
She called just now to tell me.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.400
So what? Did you stop giving
the old perv what she wanted?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.600
Say that again
and I'll kill you.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
Go.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.000
POLICE STATION

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
Unbelievable.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.160
-Did you see Nieto leave?
-Yes, he left with Abaño.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.640
I spoke to one of the priests
who runs the residency,

21:48.760 --> 21:51.040
and he said the guy
who lives in this room...

21:51.040 --> 21:51.120
and he said the guy
who lives in this room...
Is being treated for aggression,
he likes mystery novels,

21:51.120 --> 21:54.480
Is being treated for aggression,
he likes mystery novels,

21:54.600 --> 21:56.840
works in a binding workshop,
is methodical,

21:57.000 --> 21:59.800
has no social life and practices
self-love in his free time.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.120
Why did I bother coming?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
-To tell me what I don't know.
-Right.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.160
-Got anything?
-He snuck out and came back

22:06.280 --> 22:08.160
in the early hours,
not for the first time.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.480
He's done it before?

22:09.640 --> 22:12.120
Yes, that's why they changed
his medication.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.000
He's... on edge.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.040
They do good work
at this foundation.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.920
It doesn't seem there is
anything suspicious here.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
You don't think
he freed the monkeys?

22:23.680 --> 22:26.880
-That's an assumption.
-Yeah, but... the badge we found

22:27.040 --> 22:29.160
-was from here.
-The only thing we know

22:29.320 --> 22:32.360
is that he sneaks out at night,
and that's not a crime.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.280
They'll just make him
go without dessert.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.600
Right,
and the porn is crazy old.

22:40.160 --> 22:41.480
There's something here.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Damn.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
It's him.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.360
MILK

24:21.720 --> 24:25.800
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY CENTER

24:36.760 --> 24:38.120
-Police.
-Don't move.

24:38.120 --> 24:38.160
-Police.
-Don't move.
-Don't move.
-Hands up where I can see them.

24:38.160 --> 24:40.760
-Don't move.
-Hands up where I can see them.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.080
Come on.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.320
Take it easy.

24:45.920 --> 24:46.920
Turn around.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.080
Something wrong, officers?

25:00.240 --> 25:01.800
-Don't move!
-For god's sake.

25:11.320 --> 25:12.320
Goddammit.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.960
What are you running for?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.400
WE WANT PROTECTION

25:45.560 --> 25:46.880
JUSTICE

25:47.040 --> 25:48.000
THEY'RE KILLING US

25:54.600 --> 25:56.000
They've got someone. Move.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.240
-Who is it?
-Step back.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.120
-Is it him?
-I'm saying nothing.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.480
Please, tell me.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.360
You know reporters
can't be back here.

26:17.520 --> 26:18.800
The bad ones maybe.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.880
And the good ones
get grazed knees, do they?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.080
-I'm saying nothing.
-Get out of here.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.880
Yes, alright.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.600
Okay.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.200
Get undressed.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.840
-What are you going to do?
-Don't be nosey.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.040
Strip off completely
and get in the tub.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.960
Stand up,
I don't want to miss any.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.760
It's 90 degrees,
it's hardly cold.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.640
I won't keep you here
like an animal.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.600
Arms up.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.640
That's it.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.640
Turn around.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.000
Eat a bit of fruit,
here in front of me.

27:34.400 --> 27:35.440
Why am I here?

27:38.120 --> 27:39.960
We all have a purpose in life.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.040
Yours is being a down-and-out.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.120
Thankfully, that means
I can fulfill mine.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.800
I don't understand.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.720
You will soon enough.

28:00.360 --> 28:01.440
I'm sorry.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.360
About this morning.
I didn't mean it.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.960
-I'm sorry.
-What's done is done.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.480
Come on.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.760
Have a seat, buddy.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.080
Hands on the table.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.600
Take it easy. He's all yours.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.560
What's so funny?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.360
I'm a smart guy.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.720
-You took your time catching me.
-Yes, ages.

28:32.080 --> 28:34.640
Exactly eight hours
from your trip to the zoo.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
Let's get started.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.640
Inspector Nieto
and Deputy Inspector Mora

28:40.840 --> 28:42.880
interviewing the accused...

28:45.520 --> 28:48.600
...with initials A-C-R,
Andrés Cuevas Rodríguez,

28:48.720 --> 28:51.440
currently residing at
the Padres Redentores Residence,

28:51.640 --> 28:54.920
twenty-one Alameda Street.
Are these details correct?

28:57.080 --> 28:59.000
Answer yes or no.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.760
-So, we...
-I know how this works. Yes.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.200
Fine.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.080
I can also confirm
you have rejected the presence

29:06.200 --> 29:08.160
of a lawyer
in these proceedings.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.880
-Is that correct?
-Correct.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.880
You were arrested
at your residence

29:14.000 --> 29:15.880
in possession of items
which allegedly

29:16.080 --> 29:17.760
-implicate you in...
-Sorry.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.680
When you tell
the media about my arrest

29:25.800 --> 29:27.440
I'd prefer you didn't use
my initials.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.040
"A-C-R" doesn't sound good.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.240
I don't mind you using
my real name.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.600
Andrés Cuevas Rodríguez.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.320
That's not up to you.
It's procedure.

29:36.520 --> 29:37.520
That's enough.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.560
Now,
without further interruption,

29:40.680 --> 29:42.840
you're going to answer
some questions.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.240
-Where were you the night...
-No need.

29:46.680 --> 29:47.920
What do you mean?

29:50.320 --> 29:51.320
I killed them.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.280
All of them.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.280
Holy crap.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.080
I did it.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.640
Where should I sign?

30:05.440 --> 30:07.120
-Why?
-Why did I do it?

30:08.080 --> 30:10.000
Because someone had to, right?

30:24.160 --> 30:25.680
What are you doing here?

30:26.800 --> 30:29.480
-What were you thinking?
-You gave me no choice.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.120
You got what you wanted,
a good beating.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.520
-I just wanted to help.
-Help?

30:34.680 --> 30:36.360
-Yes.
-By endangering yourself?

30:37.480 --> 30:40.520
-You must go, I have a patient.
-I'm not going anywhere.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.960
I saw you with the group
outside the station.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.080
You made all the headlines.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.920
-You broke the rules.
-They're your rules.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.600
Yes, they're my rules.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.000
I set them, you follow them.
I thought that was clear.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.520
I'm tired of you telling me
when I can come and go.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.000
-You're tired?
-Yes.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.720
Fine. Enough said. We're done.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.040
Get out of my office, now.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.120
You're on your own.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.320
You're the one on her own.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.320
Hi.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.040
Hey.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.680
Let me say
what I've come to say.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.080
This isn't a good time.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.920
It is, you haven't given me
a chance all day.

32:04.560 --> 32:05.520
I'm sorry.

32:06.720 --> 32:08.440
What I did this morning
was awful.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.360
I'm a monster,
I was so unfair to you.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.800
Please, forgive me.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.720
You're the best thing
that's happened to me in years.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.600
Hey.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.480
I was in there and I thought:
"That voice sounds familiar".

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
Right.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.640
I guess it's not a good time.

33:16.400 --> 33:18.000
You're so predictable.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Come on.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.560
Your calcium-enriched milk.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.040
Go on.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.560
-Is now a good time?
-I'm sorry.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.440
I forgot to call you back.
I apologize.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.160
Did you use up
all the prescriptions you stole?

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
You noticed.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.080
I've been going over it
for weeks.

34:30.080 --> 34:30.160
I've been going over it
for weeks.
Who is capable
of doing something so stupid?

34:30.160 --> 34:33.080
Who is capable
of doing something so stupid?

34:33.800 --> 34:35.720
-Then it struck me.
-Well.

34:37.240 --> 34:40.040
I asked you to prescribe them
but you wouldn't.

34:40.040 --> 34:40.080
I asked you to prescribe them
but you wouldn't.
Right.

34:40.080 --> 34:41.040
Right.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.160
So, what's the solution?
You steal them.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.320
-Remember, you're a cop.
-Right, it's a felony.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.560
-Are you going to report me?
-I should.

34:51.160 --> 34:52.200
What are you taking?

34:54.240 --> 34:55.240
Mom,

34:55.880 --> 34:58.040
I've had a rough day,
I don't need this.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.440
That makes two of us,
so let's drop the crap.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.200
Do you want me
to find the pills?

35:03.320 --> 35:06.120
-Shall I search the house?
-No. That's enough.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.240
I'm taking the usual stuff.

35:08.360 --> 35:12.840
Partly anti-depressants
and partly tranquilizers.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.040
I take a tranquilizer
before bed.

35:16.040 --> 35:16.080
I take a tranquilizer
before bed.
If I see I'm wide awake at 4am,
I take another half.

35:16.080 --> 35:20.080
If I see I'm wide awake at 4am,
I take another half.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.040
Great, at whim.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.320
-Non-stop.
-No.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.560
I'm mindful.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.880
I take them
when I feel like I need to.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.000
You have no idea.

35:28.640 --> 35:30.520
You're mixing them randomly.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.920
And you don't get
eight hours of sleep.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.680
Have you seen
the side effects?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.680
Anything could happen to you.

35:36.880 --> 35:38.680
What's going to happen?
Don't be dramatic.

35:42.080 --> 35:44.120
Give me the 'scripts,
if there are any left.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.240
-Only two?
-Yep.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.000
Shame on you.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.800
Any chance
of you coming to dinner tonight?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.240
No, I can't today. Tomorrow.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.600
Drink the damn milk.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.840
Yes, Commissioner?

36:49.000 --> 36:51.480
I'm going to make a statement
about the arrest.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.720
I want you there.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.720
Right.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.080
It's just...

36:59.120 --> 37:01.680
I don't feel like going
in front of the media.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.080
I've had enough already.

37:06.040 --> 37:07.880
You're going to go cold turkey?

37:08.680 --> 37:10.320
This is a good thing for you.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.160
And I'm not asking.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.840
Fine, I'm on my way.

38:19.120 --> 38:20.840
Come on in, please.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Give them each
a bottle of water.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.360
This way, take a seat.

38:29.960 --> 38:30.960
Thanks.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.040
Congratulations.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.760
-For?
-You got the murderer, right?

40:07.080 --> 40:09.840
-Commissioner, how did it...?
-Questions at the end.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.400
Good afternoon.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.920
This morning,
we detained a 32-year-old male,

40:38.080 --> 40:39.160
a Spanish national,

40:39.280 --> 40:41.800
with the initials A-C-R.

40:42.240 --> 40:44.000
Following police questioning,

40:44.440 --> 40:46.360
he confessed
to being the perpetrator

40:46.520 --> 40:48.040
of the crimes committed

40:48.040 --> 40:49.920
against those released
under the Parot doctrine.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.120
-Does that mean the murderer...?
-It means what I just said,

40:53.720 --> 40:58.240
that the suspected killer
will now be tried...

40:58.400 --> 41:00.280
There's been another one.
We messed up.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.280
"Time served".

41:25.520 --> 41:27.400
The Secretary of the Interior.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.560
I think you should pick up.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.680
Don't tell me what to do,
please.

41:35.680 --> 41:37.880
I don't know what to tell him.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.120
What can you tell him?
The truth.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.760
We got the wrong guy.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.440
He should let people
do their jobs,

41:44.600 --> 41:45.960
and not be so hasty.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.880
We had to come across
the typical loser,

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
who wanted
his fifteen minutes of fame.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.200
Well, that's what happens

41:52.320 --> 41:54.560
when cases
become such a media circus.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.440
We should have made the deal
and waited.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.280
But it doesn't matter
who screwed up,

41:59.400 --> 42:01.840
what matters is
that this isn't over.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.720
Yes, Mr. Secretary.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.240
TIME SERVED

43:25.680 --> 43:27.680
Do we know anything about him?

43:29.080 --> 43:31.680
-Do we know anything about him?
-He killed whores.

43:32.760 --> 43:34.080
He killed whores.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.000
He took them home,
sliced them open

43:36.120 --> 43:38.080
and let them bleed out.
He took them home,

43:38.080 --> 43:38.120
and let them bleed out.
He took them home,
sliced them open
and let them bleed out.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.520
sliced them open
and let them bleed out.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.600
...sliced them open
and let them bleed out.

44:15.360 --> 44:17.000
Watch out! Get down!

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
That girl must be going
through hell

44:39.120 --> 44:40.640
to do something like that.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.720
She was hopped up on LSD.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.800
180 micrograms of lysergic acid
diethylamide in her blood.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.320
-I can't cover this up.
-You know her, dammit.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.600
-She's a great cop.
-She was, Nieto.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.200
Isabel hasn't been herself
for a long time.

44:57.360 --> 45:00.280
She's under immense pressure.
The guy who raped her is out.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.120
I have to suspend her, Nieto.

45:02.840 --> 45:06.120
She just shot a corpse to pieces
and nearly killed both of us.

45:06.120 --> 45:06.160
She just shot a corpse to pieces
and nearly killed both of us.
She would have shot anyone
who passed by.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.800
She would have shot anyone
who passed by.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.560
I'm going home.

45:13.080 --> 45:14.080
Commissioner.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.120
I'm sorry, I...

45:18.120 --> 45:20.160
-want to apologize.
-No.

45:25.840 --> 45:26.840
Isabel.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.640
What are you doing here?

45:30.960 --> 45:31.960
I came to defend myself.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.680
I didn't take anything.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.000
So you said, several times.

45:40.920 --> 45:43.600
-Something's happening to me.
-Yes, that's clear.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.040
I didn't take anything.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.000
So? What is this?

45:51.120 --> 45:54.120
Some kind of outlandish plot?
We're all against you?

45:58.040 --> 45:59.640
I'll take you home,
you're a mess.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.080
No. Get off me.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.200
Don't look at me like that,
with pity.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.960
All I want
is someone to believe me.

46:13.000 --> 46:14.840
That's becoming harder.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.840
There's someone on the tracks!

47:46.120 --> 47:47.400
There's a girl on the tracks!

47:49.400 --> 47:50.400
She's on the tracks!

48:12.960 --> 48:14.160
Isabel.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.480
You're alright, it's okay.

48:20.760 --> 48:21.960
Take it easy.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.160
It's over.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
It's okay.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.120
It's okay.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.360
Relax.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.080
It's alright, you're okay.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.640
You're okay.
