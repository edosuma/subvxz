A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

01:01.311 --> 01:04.690
<i>Today's legendary dish is fried chicken!</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:08.819
<i>Oh, my goodness. I'm already salivating.</i>

01:09.528 --> 01:14.157
<i>Then, who's the owner of this restaurant
that serves this mouthwatering dish?</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:16.368
<i>Boss, where are you?</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.622
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.623
<i>My gosh!</i>

01:21.707 --> 01:24.584
<i>Wait, this young lady here
isn't a part-timer?</i>

01:24.668 --> 01:26.795
<i>She's actually the owner of this place?</i>

01:27.963 --> 01:29.673
Our secret is my deep-frying method.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.301
The temperature of the oil
has to be 170Â°C.

01:32.384 --> 01:37.097
Chicken tastes the best when it's
deep-fried for exactly 11 minutes.

01:38.765 --> 01:42.644
-And now, we just wait.
<i>-Well, Ms. Shin.</i>

01:42.728 --> 01:47.733
<i>Shouldn't you be out on a date
rather than frying chicken here?</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:50.652
When I was about ten years old,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.281
my father suddenly left home.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.450
Since then, my mom...

01:58.702 --> 02:01.121
She's had a tough time.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.002
You know those accessories like hairpins.

02:08.502 --> 02:10.797
I'd buy them wholesale
at Dongdaemun Market...

02:12.716 --> 02:14.843
and sell them at subway stations.

02:17.638 --> 02:21.308
My mom still tells me that
I make the best fried chicken.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.271
<i>This young owner
is working hard toward her dreams.</i>

02:26.355 --> 02:29.858
<i>Ru-mi Shin's future is surely bright!</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:33.153
Fried chicken with Cheongyang
chili peppers is amazing!

02:33.403 --> 02:35.072
-It's amazing!
-It's amazing!

02:35.155 --> 02:40.911
FRIED CHICKEN WITH CHEONGYANG
CHILI PEPPERS IS AMAZING!

02:46.583 --> 02:52.672
CHAMPION YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR
RU-MI SHIN, MAEM MAEM CHICKEN

03:17.531 --> 03:18.824
<i>Hey, Ru-mi.</i>

03:19.157 --> 03:20.075
Mr. Kim.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.119
-My place must be the first one.
<i>-What?</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:25.539
-They're here.
<i>-Oh, okay. I'll be right there.</i>

03:26.915 --> 03:28.959
-You jerks!
-Just push through!

03:29.042 --> 03:30.836
-How dare you barge in here?
-Get over here.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.840
Do you even have the permit? You assholes!

03:34.923 --> 03:36.341
-Get out of our way!
-You bastards!

03:36.425 --> 03:37.300
Get her out!

03:37.968 --> 03:39.344
Behave yourself, will you?

03:46.101 --> 03:48.228
-Let go! You bastards.
-Just drag her out.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.487
My gosh...

03:58.447 --> 03:59.865
Get lost already!

04:01.616 --> 04:03.618
Hey, let go!

04:03.702 --> 04:05.036
-Get her out of here.
-Let go!

04:05.245 --> 04:06.872
-Ru-mi!
-Just drag her out.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.082
-I can't leave. I won't go anywhere!
-Jeez.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.333
-Ru-mi!
-Stay out of this!

04:10.417 --> 04:13.962
-You jerks!
-Drag her out!

04:16.882 --> 04:18.048
Let's get this done quickly.

04:18.382 --> 04:20.594
-Hurry! Hurry the hell up.
-Let go!

04:21.178 --> 04:23.430
Let go of me. I won't leave! Let go!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.980
-Mom!
-Don't move.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.648
-Mom!
-God, you bitch.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.775
MAEM MAEM CHICKEN

04:34.858 --> 04:35.984
Come help me here.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.361
-Mom! You bastards...
-You little...

04:38.612 --> 04:40.071
-Gosh, keep still.
-Mom!

04:42.115 --> 04:44.034
-Drag her out.
-Don't you lay a finger on her!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.215
Fuck, we're screwed.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.176
Is she dead?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.102
Is she breathing? Call Boss. Right now.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.604
Gosh, fuck.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.358
That woman isn't moving at all.

05:16.441 --> 05:19.319
-Let us through!
-Jeez, what's this now?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.072
-Ms. Kwon.
-My gosh.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.740
-Ms. Kwon!
-Ru-mi!

05:23.949 --> 05:26.409
-No...
-Ru-mi...

05:26.493 --> 05:28.787
-You son of a bitch! Who did this?
-Shit.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.081
Can someone please call 911?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.041
Call the police!

05:33.250 --> 05:35.085
-You bastards.
-Hey, call 911.

05:36.127 --> 05:40.257
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

06:44.154 --> 06:45.572
What's wrong with this spring water?

06:47.907 --> 06:50.285
I think this water is polluted.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.745
Let me get some.

06:52.037 --> 06:52.912
Well, this is...

07:01.588 --> 07:02.589
It tastes weird.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.299
This water has gone bad.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.261
Jeez, how come no one believes me?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.519
Hello.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.374
ENJOY A CUP OF COFFEE
WHILE YOU WAIT

07:54.933 --> 07:56.518
Gosh, seriously.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.853
Have some coffee if you're done.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.271
-Coffee?
-Yes.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.401
Coffee sounds good.

08:04.693 --> 08:05.902
Let's see.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.489
Seok-heon, why did you buy
so many instant coffee packets?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.074
I didn't buy these.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.453
Why would I buy these when there's
always a pile of them at the bank?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.455
But, they are for their customers.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.834
I'm just a cleaning lady here,
so I never feel like I can drink

08:20.917 --> 08:22.127
that free coffee.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.839
God, don't be like that.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.967
No one's going to say anything.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.725
I even take toilet paper from here.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.518
Ta-da!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.352
You sure got some balls.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.813
-You should put it back.
-No, I won't. It's mine!

08:42.897 --> 08:43.940
Goodness.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.650
You're not having coffee?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.110
Gosh.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.322
My tummy is upset. It must be
from the spring water I had this morning.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.575
You need to be careful
even with spring water these days.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.077
I heard that tap water is better
because of pollution.

08:56.161 --> 09:00.206
Don't you worry. A shot of soju
on my way home will totally cure this.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.708
Jeez, don't drink too much.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.252
You aren't young anymore.
You must take care of your health.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.379
You don't even have anyone
to look after you.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.881
Rub my tummy, please.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.633
Oh, sir.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.074
Let's see. Let's see now.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.159
Hey, don't work too hard.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.788
SECURITY OFFICE

09:39.871 --> 09:41.289
Don't be late tomorrow.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.875
You were 30 minutes late
on the other day too.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.170
Okay, I heard you.
Jeez, he's such a nagger.

09:55.804 --> 09:58.515
Ma'am, these coffee packets
are for our customers.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.558
Who told you that you can take them?

10:01.101 --> 10:03.103
You're the one who's been stealing them,
aren't you?

10:03.186 --> 10:05.855
No, this was my first time.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.109
Look, do you think we put them there
for you to grab them like that?

10:09.234 --> 10:10.610
Do you have no common sense?

10:10.693 --> 10:13.029
I thought I could drink them
when I'm craving sweets...

10:13.113 --> 10:14.864
I'm asking why you thought that way!

10:15.740 --> 10:17.492
Ma'am?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.079
Can you at least look at me?
I'm talking to you now.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.205
I'm sorry.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.208
Ma'am, we'll have to take this
out of your paycheck.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.711
God, that dumb woman. If you take

10:29.379 --> 10:32.924
that many at once,
they'll obviously notice it.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.343
Gosh, how stupid.

10:37.679 --> 10:39.347
She's so tactless.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.810
God, my stomach...

10:45.478 --> 10:46.354
It hurts...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.151
No.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.236
No!

11:37.280 --> 11:38.281
Jeez.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.867
Sir? Hey, you!

11:44.078 --> 11:45.997
Can't you drink responsibly?

11:46.164 --> 11:47.248
Look at this mess!

11:47.498 --> 11:49.125
-Sorry.
-Go home already.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.170
Get up and go home!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.439
God...

12:12.815 --> 12:13.983
Oh, boy.

12:58.945 --> 12:59.862
Hello?

13:02.991 --> 13:03.908
Hello?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.160
<i>Dad.</i>

13:08.162 --> 13:09.247
<i>It's me, Ru-mi.</i>

13:10.790 --> 13:12.333
<i>Mom passed away.</i>

13:12.834 --> 13:14.961
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

13:21.968 --> 13:24.220
Gosh, Ru-mi...

13:24.429 --> 13:26.389
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.267
You poor thing...

13:30.018 --> 13:31.477
Ru-mi. Stay strong, okay?

13:32.186 --> 13:33.521
We're sorry we can't stay.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.398
It's okay. You should get going now.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.150
My gosh...

13:37.650 --> 13:39.235
Honey, come on. Let's go.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.196
Oh, God...

13:46.909 --> 13:47.910
That poor thing.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.162
Calm down.

13:54.917 --> 13:55.877
I'll be okay.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.630
-Take care.
-You should go back in.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.215
-Bye.
-Let's go.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.134
-Bye.
-Bye.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.029
Gosh...

14:27.658 --> 14:30.912
Sorry for calling you out of the blue.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.875
Was she sick?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.669
This is so sudden.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.051
I called you because I found
your number on Mom's phone.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.222
I mean...

14:51.391 --> 14:52.683
You are my dad, you know.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.445
Have some food.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.781
-Ru-mi.
-You scoundrels!

15:07.031 --> 15:08.533
How dare you set foot in here!

15:08.616 --> 15:10.618
-Jeez.
-Have some shame!

15:10.701 --> 15:11.828
-Be quiet, please.
-Let go!

15:11.911 --> 15:15.081
-We're here to pay our condolences.
-Why are you being like this?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.625
-Ma'am, please. Be quiet now.
-Let go. I said, let go.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.336
-That son of a bitch...
-Why are you being like this?

15:20.420 --> 15:22.463
-What the hell.
-Please, enough.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.926
-What the fuck?
-That little...

15:27.051 --> 15:27.969
Ru-mi.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.013
Hey, did you get a perm?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.016
-I even got a hair treatment.
-Jeez, what a moron.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.435
What? Moron?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.270
Mr. Min.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.106
I thought I'd be seeing you in court.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.150
Why would we see each other in court?

15:42.233 --> 15:45.903
Ru-mi, you're making my life so difficult.
I'm really stressed out.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.029
-Why would you be...
-Hey.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.699
Your mother passed away while driving.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.659
Why are you putting the blame on us?

15:51.742 --> 15:54.495
You obviously think like that
because you're completely delusional.

15:54.579 --> 15:57.999
-What? Delusional? Hey, let go.
-Hey, break it up.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.500
-What is happening?
-Let go!

15:59.584 --> 16:01.002
I told you to let go of me!

16:01.085 --> 16:03.212
-Goodness!
-How dare you call me delusional!

16:03.296 --> 16:04.672
-Enough already.
-What's this?

16:06.215 --> 16:08.468
Gosh, Mr. Min.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.139
This country is governed by law.
Why don't we go by the law?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.766
-You guys are acting like thugs.
-What? Thugs?

16:15.850 --> 16:16.851
Hey, stop it.

16:20.229 --> 16:22.523
Enough already.
Can't you try to be helpful?

16:22.690 --> 16:23.691
I'm sorry, sir.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.111
-Give her the condolence money.
-Okay.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.030
Just leave. I don't need that money.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.659
I'm sorry. This breaks my heart too.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.579
-I said I don't need it.
-Shit.

16:36.704 --> 16:38.456
I don't need your money,
you son of a bitch.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.208
I said, leave!

16:41.292 --> 16:43.002
Yes, please leave now.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.087
I'm sorry.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.672
You guys should go back in.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.258
Go on. Please leave now.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.177
Sorry again. We're sorry, okay?

16:51.761 --> 16:53.804
-That little...
-Our deepest condolences.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.642
Those pricks...

17:00.603 --> 17:01.979
You'd better put it back up.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.904
-Ru-mi, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm okay.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.698
God, that prick...

17:18.079 --> 17:19.955
Just leave if you're not going to eat.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.297
Excuse me, sir.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.260
Are you Ru-mi's father by any chance?

17:34.220 --> 17:36.806
-Yes, I am.
-My gosh, hello. I'm...

17:37.848 --> 17:41.143
Please allow me to introduce myself.
Sorry, here.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.190
JEONG-HYEON KIM, ATTORNEY AT LAW

17:48.484 --> 17:49.443
It's nice to meet you.

17:51.487 --> 17:56.492
A large-scale duty-free shopping center
for Chinese tourists will be built here.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.120
Taesan Construction won the contract,

17:59.745 --> 18:01.330
so they'll demolish this entire area

18:01.998 --> 18:03.749
to execute the redevelopment plan.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.507
Oh, it's here. This is Ru-mi's restaurant.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.640
Let me lift this.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.109
The fried chicken here was so good.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.237
Fried chicken
with Cheongyang chili pepper.

18:33.321 --> 18:36.616
I heard that Ru-mi and her mother
worked very hard to develop the recipe.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.077
It was so popular. Everyone loved it.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.413
It was on TV too.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.833
But, well...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.836
All of those people
who were with Ru-mi earlier

18:48.919 --> 18:51.339
were renting store spaces
in this area for their businesses.

18:52.173 --> 18:54.508
They've been fighting
to get proper compensation

18:54.592 --> 18:55.926
which they rightfully deserve,

18:56.886 --> 19:00.389
but Taesan has no interest in compensating
them. You saw those guys, right?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.683
They hired Mr. Min
and his guys to evict them.

19:02.767 --> 19:03.768
Look.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.604
What exactly are you after?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.357
-Pardon?
-Answer me.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.861
What is it that you want?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.156
Oh, I guess you didn't see it
on my business card.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.408
-I work for an attorneys' group...
-Bullshit.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.872
-What's your relationship with Ru-mi?
-Pardon? "Relationship"?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.666
-Do you like her?
-No.

19:28.042 --> 19:31.587
Don't lead her on unless you're going
to be responsible for your actions.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.714
Mr. Shin. Wait...

19:33.881 --> 19:36.008
DANGER - DO NOT CROSS

19:37.843 --> 19:38.803
Wait.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.223
We can win this fight, sir. Wait...

19:47.937 --> 19:50.022
YOUR BODY IS STRONGER THAN YOU THINK!

22:15.543 --> 22:17.086
God, you scared me.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.088
Is it already time for...

22:19.964 --> 22:22.967
What? Why are you here so early?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.051
Hey.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.470
Do magicians...

22:28.264 --> 22:29.598
make a lot of money?

22:30.266 --> 22:32.226
Magicians? What are you talking about?

22:32.726 --> 22:33.769
Well, you know.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.438
Those ones we see on TV

22:37.147 --> 22:39.692
who can make people float
in the air and stuff like that.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.571
I'm sure they make quite a bit.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.950
You know the nightclub
down the street, right?

22:48.284 --> 22:51.704
I heard those who do stunt shows there
make over a million won a night.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.040
In one night?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.546
Then in a month... God.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.800
They can work a few nights
and earn over ten million won?

23:05.384 --> 23:06.844
What's gotten into you?

23:09.888 --> 23:12.641
Did you come this early
to make up for being late yesterday?

23:15.019 --> 23:18.981
Look at you, Seok-heon.
You're finally growing up.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.365
THE LATE JEONG-HUI KWON

23:35.164 --> 23:36.123
Let's go.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.547
Let's see what's going on
with the prosecution

23:43.631 --> 23:45.341
while we wait for the autopsy results.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.060
NAMPYEONG SHOPPING ARCADE

23:57.019 --> 23:59.772
-There she is.
-My gosh, that poor thing.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.149
-She must be devastated.
-You must be exhausted.

24:04.026 --> 24:04.943
Let's go in.

24:05.319 --> 24:06.862
-My heart is with you.
-I know it's hard.

24:07.571 --> 24:08.614
Let's go in.

24:11.867 --> 24:14.036
-She's here.
-My gosh, we're glad to see you.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.954
-Have a seat.
-My deepest condolences.

24:19.124 --> 24:22.711
Those thugs are already camping out
just down the street from here.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.380
What? They're still here?

24:24.546 --> 24:26.590
They already came here earlier
and caused a scene.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.133
Those hoodlums are roaming around

24:28.217 --> 24:30.761
and smashing windows
of empty shops for no reason.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.639
They're even drawing
grotesque images all over the walls

24:33.722 --> 24:35.015
with red paint.

24:35.099 --> 24:38.060
They've even been drawing skulls
all over the place, for God's sake.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.896
Attention, please.
I know how devastated all of you must be.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.565
I'm meeting with the prosecutor tomorrow,

24:44.066 --> 24:45.734
so please bear with me.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.862
But as you know, the prosecution
has been on Taesan's side.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.948
The law won't help us, don't you think?

24:51.031 --> 24:52.366
Everyone sides with money.

24:52.449 --> 24:55.703
-She died for nothing.
-Gosh, stop it.

24:55.786 --> 24:58.372
Our situation is bad,
but whenever I think about Ms. Kwon...

24:59.790 --> 25:01.875
-We can't back down like this.
-Absolutely not.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.503
Ms. Kwon worked so hard
for her restaurant...

25:07.798 --> 25:10.217
It'll be great if all the men
can stand guard here tonight.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.593
I'll stay too.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.011
-Sure.
-No problem.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.723
Why would you stay here?
You won't even be of any help.

25:18.726 --> 25:22.229
Well, I mean, if those guys from earlier
bulldoze into this place,

25:22.312 --> 25:24.189
you people won't be able to do anything.

25:24.273 --> 25:28.360
Right, that's why I told you
that we have to be prepared.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.781
Those in other redevelopment areas
even made Molotov cocktails.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.825
Please, Mr. Kim.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.119
See, 80 percent of this
is about winning public opinion.

25:37.286 --> 25:40.330
Using Molotov cocktails
will only put them at an advantage.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.416
-Don't even think about it.
-Then what should we do?

25:42.499 --> 25:43.417
What about them?

25:43.500 --> 25:46.170
They've attacked us with metal pipes.

25:47.087 --> 25:50.257
Are you saying we should do nothing
and just let them beat us?

25:50.340 --> 25:51.925
No, ma'am. That's not what I meant.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.262
That is what you meant.
You don't even have a plan.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.308
Ru-mi, staying here will be too dangerous.

25:59.433 --> 26:02.436
I know it's hard, but just give up now.
I seem to have a bizarre ability now,

26:02.519 --> 26:03.687
so I can definitely help you

26:03.771 --> 26:05.439
-Let's talk later.
-open a new restaurant.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.108
-Leave, please.
-You need to go to college too.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.278
And you folks need
to come to your senses too.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.948
Do you actually think you can win
this fight? This isn't a joke.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.702
Don't waste your energy like this.
Figure out another way to earn a living.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.662
-Watch your mouth.
-What did you just say?

26:20.746 --> 26:23.415
-We don't even have any energy left!
-That's your problem!

26:23.499 --> 26:24.374
Gosh, enough.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.335
Why did you rope my daughter into this?

26:26.418 --> 26:27.836
-How could he...
-What is with you?

26:31.423 --> 26:33.175
I told you to just leave.

26:39.223 --> 26:40.349
All right, I'm leaving.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.439
Call me if anything happens, okay?

26:50.275 --> 26:51.193
Take care.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.111
-How ridiculous.
-What's his problem?

26:54.112 --> 26:55.405
You did nothing wrong.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.574
-I was just...
-I told you not to say anything.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.248
HOLIDAY NIGHTCLUB

27:26.103 --> 27:27.312
Do you like that?

27:28.939 --> 27:30.732
I heard you wanted to speak with me.

27:31.608 --> 27:32.568
Yes, well...

27:32.651 --> 27:37.406
It's about this special skill that I have.

27:38.699 --> 27:42.035
I'm just wondering if I'd be able
to do some shows at your club.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.413
-What kind of skill?
-Well, it's...

27:44.788 --> 27:48.458
Well, itâs kind of like
a feat of super strength.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.837
I'll show you an example. It's like...

28:02.556 --> 28:03.557
It's...

28:05.309 --> 28:07.269
You can think of it
as a type of magic trick.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.106
How do you do this?

28:11.690 --> 28:12.733
One second, please.

28:21.742 --> 28:22.951
This is...

28:23.702 --> 28:27.706
Everything about magic tricks
is a trade secret, you know.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.585
HOLIDAY NIGHTCLUB

28:31.668 --> 28:33.211
-Hello, ladies.
-Welcome.

28:33.754 --> 28:34.713
We're colleagues now.

28:37.215 --> 28:38.884
-Did you see that?
-Is he crazy?

28:38.967 --> 28:39.968
Hello, there.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.470
Come on in!

28:45.098 --> 28:46.600
It's the third floor, the third.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.270
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
I'm already here.

28:51.605 --> 28:52.606
All right.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.485
-Is he almost here?
-Yes, he's here.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.364
-Shouldn't one of us wait for him outside?
-No, he'll be fine.

29:01.365 --> 29:03.909
Anyway, he's the prosecutor's
direct supervisor.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.662
He knows about the autopsy
and how we've already

29:06.745 --> 29:08.580
submitted the doctor's note,

29:08.664 --> 29:10.707
so suss out what's going on
when he gets here.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.919
Oh, he's here.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.254
Sir, here.

29:15.837 --> 29:17.297
-Hey, Mr. Kim.
-Good to see you.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.591
Likewise. My gosh, it took me a while
to find this place.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.009
-Isn't it like a maze?
-Totally.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.552
Hello.

29:22.803 --> 29:24.137
By the way, who's this lady here?

29:24.221 --> 29:26.515
Oh, this is Ms. Ru-mi Shin,
the victim's daughter.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.308
The victim...

29:28.392 --> 29:30.394
-Hello.
-The victim's daughter...

29:32.229 --> 29:33.438
-Mr. Kim, this is...
-Yes?

29:33.522 --> 29:37.025
Sir, you can be honest with me.
Please just tell me what's going on.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.443
Gosh, this is...

29:40.279 --> 29:41.238
I'm sorry, sir.

29:41.905 --> 29:46.243
I don't feel comfortable saying this
in front of the bereaved,

29:47.035 --> 29:50.205
but I don't think the autopsy report
will be enough.

29:50.706 --> 29:51.623
Pardon?

29:52.416 --> 29:54.001
Is there any firmer evidence?

29:56.128 --> 29:58.297
Actually, one of the cars
that were parked at the scene

29:58.380 --> 30:00.590
had a dashboard camera.

30:00.674 --> 30:03.468
-Why haven't you secured it yet?
-The owner said it's fake.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.305
I bet Taesan already got to him.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.265
God...

30:08.765 --> 30:10.684
-Thank you again.
-Thank you for your time.

30:10.767 --> 30:11.685
No problem.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.103
I'll get going, then.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.521
-Take care.
-You too.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.856
-Hey, call me.
-Okay. Bye.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.860
Shall we get going?

30:22.070 --> 30:24.781
I'm going to meet the owner
of the dashboard camera now.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.450
I should go with you.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.703
No, it's okay. Seeing the victim's family
might make him uneasy.

30:30.704 --> 30:31.955
-You think so?
-Yes.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.623
Where are you headed now?

30:33.957 --> 30:35.459
Back to the shopping arcade.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.461
-I'll be off, then.
-No, wait.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.756
Wait up. I'll come with you.
I should help you get your car out.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.050
-No, it's really okay.
-Come on. Let's go together.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.551
-Well...
-Let me...

30:49.389 --> 30:51.558
Mr. Kim!

30:51.641 --> 30:54.019
-Yes, I'm coming with you.
-No, it's not that.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.812
It's that way.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.856
-My van is over there.
-Oh, I see.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.028
Have some water!

31:03.111 --> 31:05.530
<i>-Please leave a message after...</i>
-Hey!

31:07.491 --> 31:08.492
Goodness.

31:10.994 --> 31:14.206
-Why isn't she picking up?
-Hey!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.124
Go give them a hand.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.585
Gosh, hurry up.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.186
Hey, Ru-mi's here.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.315
-You're back.
-Hey, Ru-mi.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.443
How did it go? Did you meet him?
What did he say?

31:44.611 --> 31:47.823
It looks like we need to wait
and keep an eye on the situation for now.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.617
Right, I didn't think it'd be that easy.

31:51.827 --> 31:52.661
Ru-mi.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.746
Hello.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.417
Why didn't you answer my calls?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.961
I couldn't pick up because I was driving.

32:01.044 --> 32:03.380
You were driving? How far did you go?

32:03.672 --> 32:04.506
What?

32:06.133 --> 32:07.134
Gosh.

32:08.802 --> 32:10.554
Did you miss work today or what?

32:10.637 --> 32:13.598
I took some time off.
Anyway, that's not important.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.561
Can we

32:18.562 --> 32:19.646
talk for a minute?

32:24.234 --> 32:26.528
All right. Let's talk over there, then.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.947
I'll tell you everything later.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.532
-All right.
-Okay. Get some rest.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.741
See you later.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.423
What do you need to talk to me about?

32:48.133 --> 32:49.050
Ru-mi.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.805
How much longer
are you planning to stay here?

32:54.306 --> 32:56.349
I think I'll be able to earn some money.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.437
I'll be the breadwinner, so you should
just go back to school and study.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.856
Well, I'll show you. Here, look.

33:04.232 --> 33:05.609
This is a tie.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.778
I bought it for 3,000 won earlier today.
Look at this, okay?

33:25.629 --> 33:26.880
What the heck are you doing now?

33:30.217 --> 33:31.968
There's more.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.221
You'll be shocked this time.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.848
There.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.364
Good Lord.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.454
Enough already.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.422
Seriously...

34:12.300 --> 34:13.342
All right.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.844
Watch carefully now, okay?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.853
I told you to stop it!

34:28.650 --> 34:31.110
Did you spend the last ten years
learning magic tricks?

34:31.194 --> 34:33.446
Well, that's not important.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.742
You may find it uncomfortable,
but I want you to come live with me.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.828
I've somehow acquired this bizarre ability

34:40.411 --> 34:41.913
and I got a job at a club with it.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.373
Let's start over, Ru-mi.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.835
What happened to your mom
breaks my heart too,

34:47.460 --> 34:50.130
but there are some fights
that you just can't win.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.299
-A young girl like you...
-Dad.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.884
You always run away like this.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.344
What?

34:57.971 --> 34:59.389
Don't play dumb.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.766
You ran away when I was a kid.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.727
-You left me and Mom.
-Hey, Ru-mi.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.395
Gosh.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.607
Back then,
we couldn't afford to live together.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.942
You were too young,
but that son of a bitch...

35:12.235 --> 35:13.153
Sorry.

35:13.737 --> 35:17.198
I ended up in huge debt because
I stood guarantor for my friend's loan.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.742
I had no choice

35:18.825 --> 35:20.493
but to divorce your mom
to protect you two.

35:20.577 --> 35:21.661
Was that the only reason?

35:24.873 --> 35:26.833
God, you're so irresponsible.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.337
Do you remember the moment

35:31.004 --> 35:33.048
our eyes met as you were leaving
at the break of dawn?

35:40.430 --> 35:43.308
You pretended you didn't see me.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.645
Do you think

35:47.771 --> 35:49.064
that all the fighting

35:50.565 --> 35:53.109
and protesting the people here are doing

35:53.652 --> 35:55.362
are just pointless?

35:55.779 --> 35:56.946
I'm also...

35:57.656 --> 35:59.783
After losing Mom so suddenly...

36:01.951 --> 36:04.621
I'm desperately trying my best to win

36:05.288 --> 36:06.998
because that's the only way
we can survive.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.628
I'm trying to pull myself together
to get my life back on track,

36:11.711 --> 36:14.464
but you showed up
and you're ruining everything now!

36:19.844 --> 36:20.929
I'm sorry.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.935
But, don't act like you're my dad now
after being absent for years.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.103
It's disgusting.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.673
Guys, get in!

37:16.109 --> 37:18.027
-They're coming. A lot of them.
-<i>What?</i>

37:18.611 --> 37:20.113
Those hoodlums are coming!

37:20.321 --> 37:21.364
My god. We're in trouble.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.450
-What?
-What should we do?

37:23.533 --> 37:24.909
Should we call the police?

37:24.993 --> 37:27.328
What's the use?
They'll be here any second.

37:27.412 --> 37:29.372
Cops won't even bother coming here anyway.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.167
Go to the police station
and bring them here. That will be faster.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.334
Good idea. Hurry!

37:33.418 --> 37:34.544
-Hurry up.
-Yes, I agree.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.129
I'll drag them here if I have to.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.756
-Be careful.
-Use the back door.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.175
-Go on. Be careful, okay?
-You go too.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.927
-Ru-mi, we should stack them up.
-Oh, right.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.221
-Hurry up, guys.
-Block those sides too!

37:45.305 --> 37:48.141
-What are you doing? Move!
-Just bring everything.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.435
-The heavy ones.
-Let's use this too.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.195
-Move!
-Let's go!

38:01.070 --> 38:02.322
Go in!

38:02.906 --> 38:04.783
-Go!
-Run!

38:04.866 --> 38:06.284
Wow.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.161
My goodness, they sure can run.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.751
Keep moving!

38:15.752 --> 38:17.420
-Get out!
-Back off!

38:26.930 --> 38:28.181
You bitch!

38:28.264 --> 38:30.934
-Do you want to end up like your mom?
-Let go!

38:32.310 --> 38:33.812
Guys, smash everything!

38:35.605 --> 38:37.357
Shall we have a team dinner later?

38:45.990 --> 38:47.200
Get out of our way!

38:47.367 --> 38:48.785
-Ru-mi!
-Stop.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.620
-I need to...
-Goodness.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.873
Damn it!

39:11.057 --> 39:12.225
Who did this?

39:12.308 --> 39:13.434
-It's that prick.
-Get him!

39:20.149 --> 39:21.359
What just happened?

39:49.345 --> 39:50.430
Ru-mi!

39:51.764 --> 39:52.724
Are you okay?

39:53.308 --> 39:54.183
Behind you!

40:01.149 --> 40:02.567
-Gosh, Ru-mi.
-Ru-mi.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.943
Are you all right?

40:05.153 --> 40:06.738
-Don't come near us.
-Gosh.

40:11.492 --> 40:14.078
-Guys, it's okay. Just attack them!
-What are you waiting for?

40:15.121 --> 40:16.039
Attack!

40:44.525 --> 40:46.152
Please let go of me!

40:58.164 --> 40:59.582
-The cops!
-The cops are here.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.795
-What is going on here?
-Everyone, freeze.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.130
-Officer.
-That prick did it!

41:06.214 --> 41:08.341
-Are you in charge?
-Did you see that just now?

41:08.424 --> 41:09.592
-Just now...
-Gosh.

41:09.676 --> 41:11.469
-Quiet, everyone.
-Did you see?

41:11.552 --> 41:13.096
-We were just...
-Please be quiet.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.681
-As always...
-To settle it peacefully,

41:14.764 --> 41:16.808
-We need to...
-we received all the permits

41:16.891 --> 41:19.018
-before going in there,
-What the hell?

41:19.102 --> 41:20.228
-but this man...
-Look.

41:21.145 --> 41:22.897
-Look at this.
-What a liar.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.233
-He's totally faking it.
-I'm okay now.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.943
-Look!
-What?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.779
Officer, how could weaklings like us

41:29.862 --> 41:32.323
-possibly beat up these pigs?
-Hey.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.909
-Did you call us pigs? That's an insult!
-Did you hear that?

41:34.993 --> 41:37.203
-You saw that, right?
-Do you even know what it means?

41:37.286 --> 41:38.371
-Educate me!
-God.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.957
-Do you want to become human?
-This guy is the primary assailant.

41:41.040 --> 41:43.459
Officer, we're the ones
that got beaten up with metal pipes

41:43.543 --> 41:44.752
-Hey!
-and wooden sticks.

41:44.836 --> 41:45.837
Do you have proof?

41:46.129 --> 41:47.088
-Here's proof.
-Hey.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.715
Look at this.

41:48.923 --> 41:51.426
-They assaulted us ruthlessly!
-How can that be proof? We brought

41:51.509 --> 41:52.885
real, irrefutable proof

41:52.969 --> 41:55.388
-to prove what we're telling you.
-That's right.

41:55.471 --> 41:56.556
Enough, both of you!

41:57.223 --> 41:58.850
Mr. Min, let me see that proof you have.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.227
-Bring the camera. Now!
-Officer, that's not even important.

42:01.436 --> 42:03.604
You can obviously see
that some of us are injured.

42:03.688 --> 42:04.897
-Here.
-Gosh!

42:06.941 --> 42:09.235
I mean, we have injured people here.
How can he...

42:10.778 --> 42:11.654
This isn't fair.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.992
All right. Everyone, stop.
Go ahead and play the clip now.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.202
Stop! Right there.

42:18.369 --> 42:20.371
All right. This is very important.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.791
Look. Look at this. And this.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.836
Now this. Keep looking.
Don't take your eyes off. See that?

42:28.337 --> 42:29.422
You saw that, right?

42:29.505 --> 42:31.799
When this man swung his arm like this,

42:32.008 --> 42:33.551
one of my guys, this one right here,

42:33.634 --> 42:36.095
he flew like this and hit his head.

42:37.680 --> 42:41.059
Let's watch the next one.
That one shows it more clearly.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.478
Yes, this one! Stop!

42:43.603 --> 42:46.022
When you see this,
you'll totally believe me. Let's watch it.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.065
Here we go.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.025
Look, okay?

42:49.609 --> 42:51.778
Look. Look at this.
Keep looking at this guy.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.446
Look at that. That's it!

42:53.654 --> 42:55.531
Look! See what that does to him?

42:55.615 --> 42:58.409
You saw that, right?
When this man did a fireball motion

42:58.659 --> 43:02.121
and raised his arms like this,
my guy floated up in the air. Like this.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.290
God, this is hard to explain.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.335
Why don't you explain it to him?

43:07.627 --> 43:09.212
You were there with me.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.379
You crook!

43:10.755 --> 43:12.673
-What did you just say?
-You call that proof?

43:13.966 --> 43:15.426
Don't you dare try to bullshit us!

43:16.302 --> 43:17.345
Bullshit?

43:17.762 --> 43:20.098
-Does it look like I'm bullshitting you?
-Officer.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.517
He's making it up. It didn't even touch.
Let's watch...

43:22.600 --> 43:23.851
-Gosh, this is really...
-Sir,

43:23.935 --> 43:26.312
I want you to do exactly what you did
in that video to me.

43:28.689 --> 43:29.774
What's his problem?

43:29.982 --> 43:31.609
-Goodness.
-What's wrong?

43:31.692 --> 43:34.028
-What's the matter?
-That guy is crazy.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.114
-They're fooling you together.
-Mr. Min.

43:36.197 --> 43:38.616
-What?
-What's with you these days?

43:38.699 --> 43:41.702
Gosh, what did I even do?
I'm just stating the facts.

43:42.578 --> 43:44.372
-I'm speechless.
-What? Speechless?

43:44.831 --> 43:47.208
-Be open-minded and...
-Okay, all right.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.168
-You guys threw the bottle first,
-But...

43:49.252 --> 43:51.587
-so both parties are at fault.
-Why are we at fault?

43:51.671 --> 43:53.339
-That's not fair.
-Please leave for now.

43:53.422 --> 43:54.882
-Why should we leave?
-Why?

43:54.966 --> 43:56.342
We've suffered more damage.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.511
-That's enough, Ru-mi.
-We were defenseless.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.930
-Let's get out of here.
-Why did you throw the bottle?

44:01.013 --> 44:02.181
-No, that...
-Enough is enough!

44:02.265 --> 44:03.349
Don't listen to her.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.393
Hang on. What's your name again?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.186
-Jun-ho? Jun-ho.
-They're fooling you.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.396
Wait, let's...

44:08.813 --> 44:10.314
Let's watch it again. Just once more.

44:23.744 --> 44:24.871
I don't believe this!

44:25.955 --> 44:27.665
Buddy, you knocked my socks off.

44:27.748 --> 44:31.002
Tell me. How the heck did you do that?

44:31.919 --> 44:35.423
I'm pretty fascinated myself.
I guess it's like magic?

44:35.923 --> 44:38.843
We no longer need to worry about anything
since we have you now.

44:38.926 --> 44:40.052
Of course!

44:40.428 --> 44:42.346
-Right, Ru-mi?
-Oh, my goodness.

44:42.889 --> 44:44.265
I almost jumped out of my skin.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.809
-My gosh, it was incredible.
-Oh, there you are.

44:47.560 --> 44:49.270
-Show me your hand.
-It's done?

44:49.437 --> 44:51.105
Yes, it's all done.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.900
-Ru-mi's dad finished them.
-How...

44:54.108 --> 44:56.027
What do you mean? Are you okay, Ru-mi?

44:56.193 --> 44:59.280
He put his hand up like this
and taught them a lesson.

45:00.406 --> 45:01.741
-How?
-It's hard to explain.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.037
You won't even believe it.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.956
-Let's go, guys.
-But I need to know what happened.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.381
EXCLUDE NAMPYEONG SHOPPING ARCADE
FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT!

45:17.465 --> 45:18.841
EGG WORLD

45:18.925 --> 45:20.051
She's so cute.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.011
-Isn't she hotter?
-No.

45:22.136 --> 45:24.138
-This one is hotter.
-I saw her in person.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.848
-She's tall and pretty.
-Hey, listen.

45:25.932 --> 45:27.016
What are you looking at?

45:27.350 --> 45:28.392
Isn't she hotter?

45:28.601 --> 45:30.811
-This one is hot.
-Right? She's drop-dead gorgeous.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.146
She's definitely hotter.

45:33.189 --> 45:34.607
-She's really pretty.
-Guys.

45:48.454 --> 45:49.413
What the hell?

45:56.253 --> 45:59.048
Go. Let's check it out. Go on!

46:08.766 --> 46:09.642
Holy shit!

46:13.604 --> 46:14.730
What the hell is happening?

46:15.606 --> 46:16.565
Shit!

46:17.608 --> 46:18.484
Run!

46:44.218 --> 46:47.805
A little more!

47:35.895 --> 47:37.271
It worked. You did it.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.106
You did it!

47:43.903 --> 47:45.279
I can't believe what I saw.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.741
-Buddy, this ability of yours
-Oh, my.

47:48.908 --> 47:51.160
is certainly marketable.

47:51.243 --> 47:52.495
I'll be your agent.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.747
-No, hire me as your agent.
-Not a chance.

47:54.830 --> 47:55.998
-Hey.
-Listen, everyone.

48:01.504 --> 48:02.713
He'll need a lawyer.

48:04.256 --> 48:05.174
A lawyer?

48:06.675 --> 48:08.719
Anyway, let's go back down first.
Let's go.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.513
-Mr. Shin, let's go.
-That was incredible.

48:10.930 --> 48:13.599
-Wait.
-This ability of yours...

48:16.227 --> 48:18.312
Can I be part of this? Please?

48:18.771 --> 48:20.147
-I'm serious.
-Mr. Shin.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.732
-I'll come up with a plan.
-Mr. Shin.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.734
-Don't get ahead of yourself.
-Could I please

48:23.818 --> 48:25.528
have a word with you about this?

48:25.611 --> 48:28.572
Mr. Shin?
I have to be serious for a moment.

48:28.656 --> 48:30.032
It's... Well...

48:30.574 --> 48:32.743
Mr. Shin, wait. Sir?

48:35.329 --> 48:37.498
Was that real magic?

48:38.916 --> 48:40.793
I somehow acquired the ability overnight.

48:42.378 --> 48:45.005
Is it possible to become
a magician overnight?

48:45.631 --> 48:47.842
How can someone suddenly gain
that kind of ability?

48:48.843 --> 48:49.802
I know. It's odd.

48:52.555 --> 48:55.099
Maybe I've been given this ability
so that I can be

48:55.558 --> 48:57.059
a good dad for a change.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.478
A good dad?

49:00.479 --> 49:01.856
Who'd give you such...

49:02.773 --> 49:04.483
Ru-mi's mom, perhaps.

49:10.030 --> 49:13.534
CONSTRUCTION SERVICE, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

49:14.076 --> 49:15.953
Oh, man...

49:17.163 --> 49:19.957
Cigarettes can't be expensed.

49:21.542 --> 49:22.418
Why not?

49:24.336 --> 49:26.881
Hey, you guys can afford
to buy your own cigarettes.

49:28.090 --> 49:32.094
Many of our favorites like cigarettes
can't be expensed.

49:32.678 --> 49:33.554
Do you understand?

49:37.099 --> 49:40.728
Hey, I told you guys to stand guard.
What are you doing here?

49:40.895 --> 49:42.563
Sir, we have something to tell you.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.064
Se-kwon.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.108
Go on. What happened?

49:46.442 --> 49:47.401
Just tell him.

49:48.777 --> 49:50.863
We want to... We'd like to quit.

49:52.615 --> 49:54.325
Sir, it's just that...

49:55.075 --> 49:56.660
We're scared that... God.

49:56.785 --> 49:58.537
We're scared that we're going to hell.

49:58.621 --> 50:01.123
My mom said that I'll go to hell
if I do bad things like this.

50:01.207 --> 50:02.583
Hey, why... Look.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.085
-Stop crying already. Stop!
-Why would you go to hell?

50:05.169 --> 50:07.171
-Don't bring up your mom.
-You're all good guys.

50:07.254 --> 50:09.298
You're not going to hell.
Se-kwon, I'm talking.

50:09.381 --> 50:10.841
-Look at me, okay?
-Sorry, sir.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.552
-At times like this, we must
-Gosh...

50:13.636 --> 50:15.429
stick together

50:16.180 --> 50:19.099
so that we can overcome
the obstacle together.

50:19.975 --> 50:21.894
Hello, Mr. Kim.

50:22.478 --> 50:23.979
-Guys, come over here.
-Yes, sir.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.022
Oh, lunch?

50:25.856 --> 50:27.900
-Yes.
-Do you have receipts to write off?

50:28.400 --> 50:30.527
No, we were just doing some bookkeeping.

50:30.611 --> 50:32.738
-Pardon?
-The one from the restaurant earlier.

50:34.156 --> 50:35.282
These are handwritten.

50:36.659 --> 50:37.868
What's wrong with you guys?

50:38.244 --> 50:39.370
Sorry? That's fine.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.413
Handwritten receipts are not accepted.

50:41.497 --> 50:43.123
Yes, I'd love that.

50:43.207 --> 50:44.083
We just want to quit.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.085
-Sure.
-Jeez, seriously...

50:46.252 --> 50:47.294
Stupid!

50:47.711 --> 50:48.545
Hey.

50:50.673 --> 50:53.342
Can't you do that tomorrow?

50:56.887 --> 50:58.264
By the way, sir.

50:59.556 --> 51:00.849
Who was that?

51:02.017 --> 51:05.479
Taesan wants to have a lunch meeting.
Did you mess up our accounting?

51:07.481 --> 51:10.609
Sir, I have the advanced certificate
in accounting.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.741
Thank you for all of your hard work.

51:20.452 --> 51:21.829
Look at all this.

51:22.579 --> 51:24.748
We won't have to worry
about those thugs for a while.

51:27.584 --> 51:29.920
God... This is incredible.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.672
All right. Hang on!

51:32.715 --> 51:33.632
Good work, sir.

51:34.216 --> 51:35.259
Ru-mi.

51:35.676 --> 51:39.263
Your father was against this
because he doesn't want you to get hurt.

51:40.014 --> 51:42.808
Look at what's going on now.
He's become our hero.

51:44.226 --> 51:45.978
My dad is not a hero.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.064
Don't work too hard.

51:52.067 --> 51:53.319
Do you know

51:55.029 --> 51:56.655
what my name means?

51:59.616 --> 52:03.037
"Ru" means "lowly" and "Mi" means "weak."

52:07.249 --> 52:11.128
He named his own daughter like that,
for God's sake.

52:13.005 --> 52:16.133
I guess it's like those names
that supposedly ward off bad luck.

52:17.593 --> 52:19.386
-What?
-Back in the old days,

52:20.095 --> 52:22.181
people believed that
ghosts would take away kids

52:22.264 --> 52:23.682
with noble-sounding names,

52:23.766 --> 52:26.518
so they gave such hideous names
to their children on purpose.

52:27.686 --> 52:29.772
I think it shows
how much he cares about you.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.121
Ever since then,

52:46.205 --> 52:48.707
I've somehow known
that we were meant to cross paths.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.000
I'm serious.

52:50.918 --> 52:53.712
-After seeing what you can do,
-Yes.

52:53.879 --> 52:58.425
I've already started mapping out
a business plan.

52:59.009 --> 53:02.763
But do you think that my ability
can actually be used to make money?

53:03.889 --> 53:05.891
You remember Uri Geller, right?

53:06.975 --> 53:10.646
-You should travel the world like he did.
-Gosh, really?

53:10.938 --> 53:12.689
I don't even have a passport.

53:16.068 --> 53:18.862
Why have you been wasting
such a special talent?

53:19.113 --> 53:19.947
Right?

53:20.030 --> 53:21.824
All right, that should be enough for now.

53:22.950 --> 53:26.203
Thank you so much
for coming all the way here.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.496
-Thank you.
-Stay strong.

53:27.663 --> 53:29.790
-I look forward to watching the interview.
-All right.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.542
-Take care.
-Bye.

53:32.292 --> 53:33.377
Thank you again.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.711
NAMPYEONG SHOPPING ARCADE

53:36.755 --> 53:38.841
They're from a small local channel.

53:39.550 --> 53:41.093
The interview won't change anything.

53:42.094 --> 53:44.638
But still, I'm grateful
that they're interested in the issue.

53:44.805 --> 53:46.390
Who knows?

53:46.682 --> 53:48.308
It might go viral on the Internet

53:48.475 --> 53:50.144
and become
one of the top trending searches.

53:50.269 --> 53:52.646
You all heard our lawyer saying
how crucial public opinion is.

53:52.729 --> 53:53.564
Right.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.316
Ru-mi, you should go
grab a bite with your dad.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.318
-You haven't eaten all day.
-No, I'm busy.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.696
Hey, don't skip meals.
You can faint if you keep that up.

54:00.779 --> 54:02.531
-Let's go eat. Come on.
-I'm okay. Gosh.

54:07.119 --> 54:10.539
There's a stew place nearby.
We can eat there.

54:14.042 --> 54:16.170
She wasn't like that when she was a kid.

54:16.378 --> 54:18.714
Just follow her. I'll see you later.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.716
-You should eat something too.
-Okay.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.468
Jeez.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.138
Let's go.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.089
-Hello.
-Hey, Ru-mi.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.008
-I'm going for lunch.
-Have a good lunch.

55:03.091 --> 55:04.635
Mom, I really want a cell phone.

55:04.718 --> 55:05.802
Go warm up.

55:05.886 --> 55:07.763
Please! All of my friends
have cell phones.

55:07.846 --> 55:08.764
Come on.

55:09.389 --> 55:11.850
Mom, I'll ace the exam. Please?

55:12.726 --> 55:15.270
-You always say that.
-Not this time.

55:26.615 --> 55:28.992
-Two bowls of <i>seolleongtang</i> soup, please.
-Sure.

55:35.123 --> 55:36.041
Well...

55:36.917 --> 55:38.627
About those magic tricks that you do...

55:39.503 --> 55:40.337
What?

55:42.756 --> 55:46.510
Wouldn't it affect your health
if you keep using that ability?

55:49.638 --> 55:50.639
No, not at all.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.226
I don't think it matters.

55:54.518 --> 55:57.521
But still, I think you should go
see a doctor.

55:57.604 --> 55:58.605
No, I'm really fine.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.484
Actually, I feel healthier.
My constipation is gone too.

56:02.568 --> 56:04.152
You're not a doctor.

56:04.236 --> 56:06.238
-I know my body very well.
-Gosh, please just...

56:11.910 --> 56:14.329
Just go see a doctor, please.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.165
You never know.

56:23.338 --> 56:24.298
Let's eat.

56:29.386 --> 56:30.721
-Sir.
-What is it?

56:30.846 --> 56:33.515
-I can see my place from here.
-No, you can't.

56:33.682 --> 56:35.309
Jeez. Sit down, will you?

56:35.475 --> 56:37.728
Wow, this place is seriously so cool.

56:38.353 --> 56:41.565
Stop it already. I'll take you
to nice places often from now on.

56:44.359 --> 56:45.777
This place is awesome.

56:51.491 --> 56:52.409
Hello.

56:57.664 --> 56:59.625
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Kim.

57:00.208 --> 57:01.376
Director Hong is here.

57:07.924 --> 57:08.884
What a beautiful day.

57:12.763 --> 57:15.932
-Director Hong, this is...
-I know who they are.

57:16.266 --> 57:18.352
I'm here to meet them
because I know who they are.

57:22.105 --> 57:24.107
Hello, Mr. Min.
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

57:24.191 --> 57:25.442
It's no problem at all.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.737
I should've met you
and treated you to a meal sooner.

57:31.573 --> 57:34.952
You haven't even touched the food yet.
The shrimp is still standing upright.

57:35.535 --> 57:37.746
-The food here is so delicious.
-Really?

57:37.829 --> 57:39.331
When I was going to school in New York,

57:39.414 --> 57:41.708
I used to eat at one of Woody Allen's
favorite restaurants.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.835
The food here tastes similar.

57:43.919 --> 57:47.506
We thought it'd be rude to start eating
before you got here.

57:48.090 --> 57:49.675
I've put on too much weight recently.

57:50.258 --> 57:51.760
I look chubby, don't I?

57:52.469 --> 57:55.222
-Don't I have a fat face?
-No, you have the perfect oval face.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.350
Director Hong,
what would you like to order?

57:58.850 --> 58:00.477
-I want coffee.
-Sure, right away.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.481
I guess we should talk about work now.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.024
Oh, right!

58:06.775 --> 58:08.193
I almost forgot.

58:08.777 --> 58:10.237
Please tell them to come in.

58:13.198 --> 58:16.284
Well, first things first.
Let's just get it out of the way.

58:16.368 --> 58:17.828
Yes, totally.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.715
-Boss!
-Who are you guys?

58:29.798 --> 58:31.008
What are you doing now?

58:31.717 --> 58:33.593
Stop it, please. Why are you doing this?

58:33.802 --> 58:35.220
-Please don't do this.
-Wait.

58:35.303 --> 58:36.513
-Just a second.
-Don't!

58:36.596 --> 58:37.806
-No!
-Oh, god.

58:37.889 --> 58:41.226
Please stop. Why are you hitting him?

58:41.685 --> 58:43.353
Why are you doing this?

58:43.437 --> 58:45.230
We came here for lunch.
What is your problem?

58:45.313 --> 58:46.398
Who the heck are you guys?

58:46.481 --> 58:47.858
Mr. Kim!

58:47.941 --> 58:49.651
Please call the police. Now!

58:49.735 --> 58:50.694
Hurry up!

58:55.365 --> 58:58.368
Stop it, please. Don't hit him.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.372
It must hurt so much. Please stop...

59:03.248 --> 59:04.958
Stop it, please.

59:05.042 --> 59:07.085
Stop hitting him, please.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.129
You guys are going to kill him!

59:14.551 --> 59:15.594
That was hard.

59:16.803 --> 59:18.138
I'm sorry...

59:18.972 --> 59:19.890
I'm sorry.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.516
-I sounded fake, didn't I?
-Pardon?

59:23.268 --> 59:25.312
-No.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Min.

59:25.395 --> 59:27.314
-No, please don't worry about it.
-We recently

59:27.397 --> 59:30.150
got sued by some nutjobs
over things like this.

59:30.233 --> 59:32.069
-I'm sorry.
-Those in our legal team

59:32.235 --> 59:34.404
advised me to record the whole thing.

59:34.488 --> 59:36.448
Oh, I see.
Did the recording turn out well?

59:41.578 --> 59:43.747
Oh, this looks delicious.

59:46.917 --> 59:49.961
-Please get up and sit over there.
-No, it's okay. I'm fine here.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.964
Your chair is all busted though.

59:53.048 --> 59:55.133
I'm fine like this. I'll just stand here.

59:55.217 --> 59:56.134
All right, then.

59:56.968 --> 59:58.303
-Let's talk business now.
-Okay.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:00.180
-Mr. Min.
-Yes.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:05.102
You're well aware of how important
this project is to us.

01:00:05.185 --> 01:00:07.354
Yes, I am. I'm fully aware.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:09.940
-I'm really sorry. I'm truly...
-So, what's the problem now?

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:14.027
Among the squatters
that we have to evict...

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:17.197
There's this strange man.

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.283
Oh, right. That was crazy.
I watched the video you sent me.

01:00:20.575 --> 01:00:23.203
Does that man have
some sort of supernatural power?

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.204
That's right.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:26.498
Then he's a hero, a Korean superhero.

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:29.960
Shouldn't people like him
wear a mask like Spider-Man

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.045
-and save people's lives?
-Right.

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.714
Why is he helping those illegal squatters?

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:37.509
-He's a bad guy.
-I know.

01:00:38.802 --> 01:00:41.096
-Have you figured out who he is?
-Yes, we have.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:45.517
From what we know, he's the father
of a girl named Ru-mi Shin.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.520
Oh, I see. It won't be a problem, then.

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.939
How long will it take to evict them
if he's not there?

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:52.941
A day will do.

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:55.485
-Then how about I give you 48 hours?
-That'd be great!

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.696
That will definitely be enough time.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:58.989
-What else?
-Pardon me?

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:00.198
What else do I need to know?

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:05.662
A little while ago, Ru-mi's mother died
because of our mistake.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:08.832
Oh, that. I'm already aware of it.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.041
Just those two issues?

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.336
I'll go bring it.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:15.255
Hey, come and eat.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.258
Have a seat. Try the tofu.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:19.885
Have more potato.

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:22.179
Everyone, come and look at this!

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:25.140
-There's something about us online.
-What?

01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:27.809
-Let me see.
-Could it be the interview from today?

01:01:28.894 --> 01:01:30.604
-What is it about?
-Show us.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.355
-My gosh.
-What?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.566
-Hurry up.
-My goodness.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.943
<i>Next news.</i>

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.613
Have you heard of the term,
"the super-powerless"?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:42.115
We received a video clip
from a demolition company

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.825
which was taken during a forced eviction,

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:45.952
and a strange phenomenon
is captured on it.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.078
Letâs take a look.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:53.001
REDEVELOPMENT IN CRISIS
ON THE 6TH NAMPYEONG DISTRICT, SEOUL

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.961
<i>All of you who are watching this now</i>

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:57.255
must be as shocked as we are.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.340
CIVILIANS ARE TERRIFIED

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.634
The chairman of World Weapon
Research Association is here

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:03.053
to help us understand
what we saw in the video.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.930
Let's hear what he thinks.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.975
-Hello, Mr. Song.
-Hello, it's nice to meet you.

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:13.021
The clip we just watched
is definitely shocking.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.982
Can something like that
happen in real life?

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.069
Yes, it's certainly possible.

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.779
How is it possible?

01:02:20.862 --> 01:02:23.448
If you take a closer look
at the weapon he used...

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:25.992
Most people probably can't see it,

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:28.620
but he's holding
a small device in his hand.

01:02:28.954 --> 01:02:30.038
And he presses it like this.

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.250
In my expert opinion...

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:35.377
As soon as he presses it,

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:39.089
powerful shock waves are generated.
I think that's how the weapon works.

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:40.632
Well...

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.009
How do you think the protesters
came into possession

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.594
of such a state-of-the-art weapon?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:46.429
Right, that's the question.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.431
How do you think they got it?

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:50.475
We all know the answer.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:51.810
North Korea!

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:56.231
You see, North Korea

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.234
has already infiltrated
our society deeply.

01:02:59.317 --> 01:03:01.361
They've been doing all sorts of things.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.196
-Goodness.
-What's he saying?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.156
-I'm speechless.
<i>-This video is proof.</i>

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.283
What?

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.326
He's spewing total nonsense.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.787
Let's stop watching it.
He's not even making sense.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:12.580
Oh, my. Something smells delicious.

01:03:13.164 --> 01:03:14.958
Guys, get Mr. Shin some food.

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.008
-What's with everyone?
-What's the matter?

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.718
Are those morons coming again?

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.429
Don't you worry. I'm going to...

01:03:29.347 --> 01:03:30.557
I'll teach them a lesson.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:32.434
What's going on?

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.728
Can I have some food?

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.364
Empty house to be demolished

01:03:46.948 --> 01:03:49.242
Come on down, everyone. The food is ready.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.328
Hey, what's that over there?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.538
-Come on down now.
-What's going on?

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.415
Mr. Kim, join us.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.875
-Hey!
-Come and have lunch.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.877
Someone is coming.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:09.804
Who are you guys?

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:12.057
Oh, hello. We're the police.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:16.311
-What are you cops doing here?
-Don't be rude, please.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:17.562
Who's Mr. Seok-heon Shin?

01:04:19.314 --> 01:04:20.523
-Hello, Mr. Shin.
-Hello.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.233
Could you please come down for a minute?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:25.195
Hang on a second.
You need to... What are you doing now?

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.198
You need to tell us what this is about!

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.076
-Do you think this is a joke or what?
-I never said that!

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:33.203
We're here to arrest that man!

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:36.081
-I haven't even done anything wrong.
-The thing is,

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.250
your employer is accusing you of theft.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:42.212
-They said you've been stealing supplies.
-No, it's not true.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.963
-I didn't.
-And you're on the run now.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:46.883
If it's just a misunderstanding,
you can explain to us.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:48.218
Come on down now.

01:04:48.385 --> 01:04:51.054
-This is crazy.
-There must've been a misunderstanding.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.181
I should go sort it out.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:55.517
I'll be back shortly. See you in a bit.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.643
-Mr. Shin.
-Mr. Shin.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:57.685
Mr. Shin.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.192
-Gosh.
-Be careful.

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:07.487
All right. You have the right to remain
silent and the right to an attorney.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.156
-What's this for?
-It's just protocol. Don't freak out.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.158
-But this is...
-It won't take long.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:13.660
Let's go.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:15.286
Well, this is...

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:19.541
Watch your head.

01:05:21.501 --> 01:05:23.002
-I'm shutting the door.
-Wait.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:26.798
My goodness...

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:34.264
Ru-mi.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:36.516
What should we do now?

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:43.982
This is nuts.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:51.573
Hey, Ru-mi.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:54.826
What?

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:58.329
Wait. Hold on, okay?

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.290
Yes, hold on a second.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.548
Ru-mi, could you try to calm down
and tell me slowly?

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:12.051
Basically, cops just showed up here
and arrested my dad.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.054
He didn't seem to know

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.432
why they were taking him.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:22.145
I think those at Taesan are trying
to remove your father from the site.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:25.773
I'll head over there now.
Don't worry too much, Ru-mi.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:28.443
Yes, I'll call you right away.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:30.236
All right.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.407
They're unbelievable. Those fuckers...

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:38.703
PROSECUTOR EUN-PYO HONG

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:40.663
Yes, hello?

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.332
-<i>Hey, Jeong-hyeon.</i>
-Yes.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.750
<i>It looks like you have a problem.</i>

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.211
<i>That case of yours.
It seems like things are going haywire.</i>

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:48.421
-What do you mean?
<i>-A guy at the company</i>

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.340
<i>just turned himself in
for killing the woman.</i>

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.091
What?

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:55.887
All right. Now, let's solve
the problems one by one.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:56.804
-Yes, ma'am.
-Alright.

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:58.932
First off, are any of your guys

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.475
in desperate need of money?

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.644
Yes, most of them need money.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:05.647
Pick one and get him to turn himself in

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.690
for that woman's death.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.486
<i>After that, I want you
to shut down your business.</i>

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:15.198
<i>We'll also say that we've terminated
our contract with your company.</i>

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.910
-Let's take a picture.
<i>-Then,</i>

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:20.870
<i>start another company
under a different name.</i>

01:07:21.037 --> 01:07:24.165
<i>We'll draw up a new contract.
Won't that solve everything?</i>

01:07:24.249 --> 01:07:26.125
All right, sir. Smile.
Look at the camera now.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:27.919
-One, two, three.
<i>-You'll be so relieved.</i>

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:29.963
We'll dig up dirt on that weirdo

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:33.132
and make sure the police
keep him in their custody,

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.760
so just bulldoze that place
and evict everyone that day.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.930
We'll also make sure the police
give you guys full support that day.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:55.780
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Hey, Ru-mi.

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:57.115
Yes, what happened?

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.033
It's all over.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.786
Get out of there, all of you.

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:03.830
Hey, Ru-mi! They're coming.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:07.292
-What the hell?
-Why are there so many of them?

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:10.920
Hey.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.218
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.261
<i>Just give up.</i>

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:21.639
You need to run away.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:25.518
-I'm really sorry.
<i>-Mr. Kim.</i>

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:28.145
You see,

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.607
if we were going to give up,

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.359
we wouldn't even have started this.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.529
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:38.406 --> 01:08:39.657
Wait, Ru-mi...

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:43.995
Shit.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:46.872
Get ready, guys.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:56.131
Mr. Seok-heon Shin.

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.291
Are you here to carry out
the eviction today?

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:33.336
Is it true that the police are working
with an eviction contractor?

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:34.754
-It's over there!
-Say a few words.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.839
Just get them out. All of them, okay?

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.091
-Move.
-Go!

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.760
-Get them.
-Move back.

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:45.807
Hello.

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:48.768
I work for Taesan Construction.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:53.314
You can just call me Director Hong.
I'm pretty high up in the company.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.358
-Taesan Construction?
-That's right.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.985
The company that's holding you here.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.029
Well, but...

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.657
I didn't even do anything...

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.370
I'm a busy person,
so I'll get straight to the point.

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:09.622
Well...

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.999
That ability of yours...

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.836
You developed it recently, didn't you?

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:16.295
Yes.

01:10:17.714 --> 01:10:19.048
That's what I thought.

01:10:20.341 --> 01:10:23.511
I guess that's why
you wanted to show it off.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:25.888
You probably just couldn't control it.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:28.015
I have some friends like that.

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:31.102
They couldn't control themselves
and did illegal drugs. And now...

01:10:32.019 --> 01:10:32.979
You know what, though?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.565
That power you have is quite fascinating,

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:38.359
but I can easily say that it's dangerous

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.737
and that it can be used for crimes.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.574
There are so many things
we can do to screw you over.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.743
It'll really be a piece of cake for us.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.786
Listen to me.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.914
Wouldn't you be happy
if you could just make some money?

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:56.127
Why waste your talent when you can do
something productive with it?

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:57.545
From what I saw,

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.841
I think that your ability
will be very useful for Taesan.

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.551
You sure have a very special talent.

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.846
You're obviously far better
than those morons

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:09.056
we hired to evict everyone
from that district.

01:11:09.432 --> 01:11:13.603
Well, I'm not sure what you're getting at,

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.398
but we just want
reasonable compensation for...

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.816
Jeez...

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:21.819
What is the matter with you?

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.406
Your daughter.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.326
She'll probably get arrested today.

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:30.620
What?

01:11:30.703 --> 01:11:31.871
-<i>You are</i>
-Get lost, you prick!

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:35.416
-<i>partaking in an illegal protest now.</i>
-How dare you!

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.586
<i>Please vacate the site immediately.</i>

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:41.923
<i>I repeat.</i>

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:45.510
-<i>You're partaking</i>
-Get lost!

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.012
-<i>in an illegal protest now.</i>
-You son of a bitch!

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.932
<i>Please vacate the site immediately.</i>

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.518
<i>If you don't cooperate,</i>

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:56.395
<i>we will have to use force
to remove you from the site.</i>

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.606
-Go away!
-You sons of bitches!

01:11:58.689 --> 01:11:59.941
Get lost!

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.610
-Take this.
-Hurry.

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:07.865
<i>You're partaking
in an illegal protest now.</i>

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:10.910
-Go away!
-Watch out!

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.162
-<i>I repeat.</i>
-You bastards!

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:14.872
-You assholes!
-Ru-mi.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.667
-<i>You're partaking...</i>
-Oh, no.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:20.628
-Run! Now!
-Guys, get out of here!

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.764
Run! Get out of here now!

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:41.774
Ru-mi! I'm here!

01:12:43.317 --> 01:12:45.027
Mr. Kim!

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:46.487
Help!

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.906
We need help here!

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:50.992
Just go, Ru-mi.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:57.665
Mr. Superhero.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.252
Those with real power

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:04.046
aren't people like us.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:07.341
They were born to win.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.552
Do you know what they can do?

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.806
Do you think they can fire
energy waves or something? No.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.392
They have power over this country,
the Republic of Korea.

01:13:16.642 --> 01:13:19.103
The country itself is their power.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.442
Everyone else, including you and me,
are just slaves of this society.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:28.362
Why can't you accept it?
Know your place, please.

01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.408
That's the lesson your daughter
will learn from getting arrested.

01:13:44.211 --> 01:13:45.421
At the moment,

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:48.925
the police seem to have a total disregard
for the safety of the protesters.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.016
Just a little more.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.980
-Just a bit more.
-Ru-mi...

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:09.570
Come on. Hurry up.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.251
-Ru-mi!
-Mr. Kim!

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:25.795
-Ru-mi.
-Hey.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:27.129
-Are you okay?
-Move her inside.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:29.715
Let's go inside. Come on.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:31.509
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:39.058
I'll give you two options to choose from.
Option number one,

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:42.186
you'll be named a dangerous man

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.855
because of that ridiculous ability
of yours, which means you

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:48.150
and your ex-con daughter will always
have to worry about how to make ends meet.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:52.488
I guess you can use your power
to collect scrap paper to make a living.

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.156
Option number two,

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:58.285
just accept the fact
that you're a mere slave.

01:14:58.619 --> 01:15:01.163
You'll do as I say and live a quiet life

01:15:01.247 --> 01:15:03.416
so that you can provide
for your clueless daughter.

01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:05.459
It's a no-brainer, right?

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:08.212
Is this hard for you?

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.883
Then I'll throw in another option for you.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:16.178
Here's option number three.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:20.307
You'll stage a coup and take the throne.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:22.518
If you can pull that off,

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:25.146
you'll be able to live however you want.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:27.982
Excuse my sense of humor.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.484
This is my business card.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.987
Call me when you make up your mind.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.072
This is very valuable.

01:15:36.073 --> 01:15:40.202
Other people suck up to me like crazy
just to get my business card.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:47.960
Oh, right.

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.839
If you use your power
to pull scraps wherever you go,

01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:54.216
it actually might be pretty lucrative.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.218
You might be able to start a big company.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:18.324
We can't really break through now
due to the fire from the explosion.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:21.410
Well, they're saying
it's hard to break through at the moment.

01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:22.620
What the hell?

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:25.748
Hey, just tell them
to bulldoze through, you idiot.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:28.417
Don't you know where the order came from?

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.295
Tell your guys to raid the place
and kill them all. Hurry up.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.381
Radio your guys now!

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.222
Mom!

01:16:41.555 --> 01:16:43.182
You need to see this. Now!

01:16:46.894 --> 01:16:48.020
<i>Can you all see that?</i>

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.397
<i>It's total mayhem here.</i>

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.568
<i>The fire keeps spreading.
What should I do?</i>

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:25.015
Open the door!

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:27.309
Hello?

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:29.311
-Ru-mi, where are you now?
-<i>I'm...</i>

01:17:31.355 --> 01:17:33.357
I'm on the fourth floor
of the shopping arcade.

01:17:33.858 --> 01:17:36.402
Go to the rooftop right now.
I'll meet you there.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:39.071
If you guys get caught,
you'll all be arrested. You hear me?

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:41.740
-No!
-Okay.

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:45.369
Everyone, to the rooftop now!

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.705
Go up to the rooftop

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.166
and go to the adjacent building
from there.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:52.668
Hurry up!

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:05.764
<i>The building got engulfed in flames
following a blast.</i>

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:08.809
-Wait, what is that?
-Hey, turn off the TV.

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.227
Is that happening right now?

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.688
I'm asking what's going on.

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:14.023
-Get in there.
-Gosh!

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:16.317
-Be quiet.
-Turn the TV back on!

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.444
Please?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:19.445
Yes, Mom.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.947
There's an emergency, so I can't talk now.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:26.493
What did you just do?

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.078
-What happened?
-Give it back.

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:29.330
Violence at Eviction Site

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:30.706
What are you doing with my phone?

01:18:30.789 --> 01:18:32.791
-Detective Yun.
-Give it back now.

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:43.969
There's nothing you can do.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:44.970
Give up already.

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.389
-Detective Yun, do something.
-I'm sorry, sir.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.600
You'd better give it back this instant.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:51.685
The cuffs came undone!

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.563
-My gosh.
-What is happening?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.030
INVESTIGATION SUPPORT UNIT

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:18.170
Don't move!

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:30.182
NAMPYEONG POLICE STATION

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:13.892
What the hell...

01:20:27.448 --> 01:20:30.951
Violent Clash
Between Protesters and Police

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:49.887
Violent Clash
Between Protesters and Police

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:50.888
Ru-mi.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:23.087
-Hurry up, guys!
-Hurry!

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:24.129
It's this way!

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.174
-Go!
-We need to hurry.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:28.300
Go!

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:32.763
-Mr. Kim!
-Just go!

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.681
-Mr. Kim, no!
-You son of a bitch.

01:21:34.765 --> 01:21:36.433
-Mr. Kim...
-Come on, Ru-mi!

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.435
-Let go!
-Just go!

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:42.773
-Don't push. Move back.
-Stop pushing!

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.205
Everyone, get in!

01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:00.541
Move. Get in!

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:01.458
SWAT

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:24.565
<i>On the rails...
I see a man hanging on to the rails.</i>

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:54.553
Honey.

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.181
I'm sorry.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:22:59.808
I'm sorry!

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.080
-My god, Mr. Shin.
-Where's Ru-mi?

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:25.209
-The roof. She's there now.
-The roof?

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:43.143
Gosh, that startled me. Who's that guy?

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:44.853
Hey, who's that man?

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:46.730
Guys.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:48.440
Get him.

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:00.160
Hey, get him!

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.746
Get him! Hold him down!

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.018
-Ru-mi!
-I'm here!

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:27.312
Over here. Use this!

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:30.023
-Over here, everyone! Hurry!
-This way!

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:31.650
-Go over to the other building.
-Hurry!

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.651
Go! Run!

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:36.989
Let go! Let go of me!

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:03.557
I just thought that this would be
like a regular part-time job.

01:25:05.267 --> 01:25:07.227
My little brother is... I'm sorry.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:14.818
Don't let any of them get away!

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.252
-Mr. Shin.
-Go. Run!

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:33.295
Come on, guys. Let's go!

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.005
Hurry...

01:25:50.103 --> 01:25:52.314
Over here, sir. Hurry up.

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:54.107
Come on, you need to hurry!

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.239
Let go!

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.494
The situation is very bad up here.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:07.079
<i>We need to come down to the ground!</i>

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.581
Mr. SWAT. Don't be such a pussy.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.166
Just arrest them.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:12.959
Arrest them all!

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.477
Help me.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.316
Please help me.

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:43.824
Hold my hand!

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:49.329
A little more!

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:27.743
God, what just happened?

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.619
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

01:27:29.703 --> 01:27:30.579
Mr. Shin.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.677
Try to come up a little higher.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:56.980
Hang in there, okay?

01:27:57.063 --> 01:27:58.440
Put your leg up here!

01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:06.740
Just a bit more. Hold this!

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:09.993
Just a little more!

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:13.580
You're almost there.

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:35.852
Ru-mi!

01:28:42.526 --> 01:28:44.444
Ru-mi!

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:51.785
Thank God.

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:58.750
Thank you.

01:29:03.755 --> 01:29:05.632
I'm sorry. Dad is so sorry.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:07.133
Ru-mi...

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:22.107
Are you okay?

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:27.571
Please take good care of my daughter.

01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:38.999
Mr. Shin.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:50.885
Dad.

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:53.680
Dad, wait...

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.515
-We have to go, Ru-mi.
-No, Dad...

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:57.517
-Let's get out of here first. Let's go.
-Dad.

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:59.936
-Let's get out of here, guys.
-Come on, Ru-mi. Let's go.

01:30:00.604 --> 01:30:01.855
-Let's go.
-Come on.

01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:35.764
-He's coming down.
-What is happening?

01:30:42.187 --> 01:30:43.271
Fine.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:45.649
You guys won.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.780
Are you happy now? You asshole.

01:30:57.369 --> 01:30:59.537
Sir!

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:01.331
Wake up!

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:03.750
Sir...

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:08.922
-My gosh.
-Sir, please breathe.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.090
Sir.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.202
4 YEARS LATER

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:27.834
HAPPY REFORM, HAPPY CITIZENS

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:36.551
Gosh, you really shouldn't be here.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:38.970
-Don't do this again, okay?
-Grow up now, will you?

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:41.723
-Be good, please.
-I hope you learned your lesson.

01:32:53.818 --> 01:32:54.778
Mr. Shin.

01:32:55.779 --> 01:32:58.740
I thought I'd be on time.
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:32:58.823 --> 01:32:59.741
Please get in.

01:33:09.793 --> 01:33:13.296
Was it all right in there?
I'm sure no one bothered you.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:14.547
It wasn't bad.

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:18.176
No one would dare to bother you
unless they want to get hurt badly.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:21.596
-How's Ru-mi doing?
-Good. She's always busy.

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.684
Oh, right. I have something to tell you.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.145
I'm getting married.

01:33:30.355 --> 01:33:31.773
-You're getting married?
-Yes.

01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:36.277
-I see. You are at the right age.
-Yes, with Ru-mi.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:41.616
-You said you didn't like her.
-No, I did like her.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:44.202
I lied to you back then.
I'm sorry about that.

01:33:45.411 --> 01:33:47.539
-You little...
-I'm sorry, Mr. Shin. Well...

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.750
I should call you Father
from now on, right?

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:52.043
Goodness.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.674
You know that
she's got a bit of a temper, right?

01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:58.883
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:03.012
<i>-Will you be all right?
-Yes, I'll just have to deal with it.</i>

01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:25.410
What's this place?

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:28.705
Oh, I guess you don't recognize this area.

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.333
This is where
Ru-mi's restaurant used to be.

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:42.844
<i>Taesan inflated the construction
cost estimates way too much,</i>

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:44.971
<i>and there was
some internal corruption too.</i>

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:48.600
<i>Anyhow, that's why the construction
hasn't even commenced yet.</i>

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:52.103
From the get-go,

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:56.399
the project wasn't even practicable.

01:35:03.907 --> 01:35:05.491
Let's go. This is an eyesore.

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:19.088
-Hello.
-One spicy fried chicken, please.

01:35:19.172 --> 01:35:20.757
It's 17,000 won. Thank you.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.305
-Take care.
-Thank you.

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:28.389
Thank you.

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:31.184
Just a little bit, please.

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:32.560
Does it have green onions?

01:35:40.193 --> 01:35:42.153
-Have more.
-I'm eating.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.741
-Mr. Shin!
-My gosh!

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.326
-Hi!
-Congratulations!

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:51.287
-Welcome back.
-It's so good to see you!

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:53.706
Welcome back!

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.124
One fried chicken at table seven.

01:35:55.208 --> 01:35:56.960
-I'm getting emotional.
-My gosh...

01:35:57.043 --> 01:35:58.002
Are you ordering to go?

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:18.856
Dad, don't just stand and stare at me.

01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:21.401
Give me a hand here, will you?

01:36:21.484 --> 01:36:24.070
I'm so busy right now.
Come on. Get to work!

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:32.161
What are you doing?

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:34.539
I wonder if I still got it.

01:36:38.543 --> 01:36:40.420
-Is it floating yet?
-No.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.465
-It's floating now, right?
-Yes!

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.302
Look, what's that?

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:54.809
You still got it!

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.240
-He and I should really travel the world.
-It's so cool!

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:14.412
Wow. They're floating in the air.

01:37:19.292 --> 01:37:26.174
SUPERPOWER CHICKEN

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:41.345
