a special moment

48:54.515 --> 48:56.475
in the history of pain care.

48:56.475 --> 49:00.771
Hospitals, doctors,
think tanks, and even the FDA

49:00.771 --> 49:04.358
are rethinking the very nature
of pain treatment.

49:04.358 --> 49:08.446
And what we've learned is
that opioids, certain kinds,

49:08.446 --> 49:12.116
are not nearly as addictive
as they have been perceived.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.868
Narcotics can be abused

49:13.868 --> 49:17.121
and are not appropriate
in all instances.

49:17.121 --> 49:20.124
But when properly
prescribed by doctors,

49:20.124 --> 49:23.961
they almost never lead
to addiction.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.964
[applause]

49:28.466 --> 49:30.551
‐ In most immediate‐release
opioids,

49:30.551 --> 49:35.306
blood plasma levels spike
between euphoria and pain.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.308
But OxyContin's
time‐release system

49:37.308 --> 49:38.517
causes blood plasma levels

49:38.517 --> 49:40.478
to have
fewer peaks and valleys,

49:40.478 --> 49:42.521
creating a plateau effect,

49:42.521 --> 49:46.984
which results in less euphoria
and less potential for abuse.

‐ Doctors were often co‐opted

tell us, what kind of ailments

51:14.530 --> 51:16.615
do your patients
typically have?

51:16.615 --> 51:19.868
‐ Many of my patients
are miners,

51:19.868 --> 51:23.330
so I see back injuries,
shoulder lacerations,

51:23.330 --> 51:25.666
broken hands, things like that.

51:25.666 --> 51:27.876
‐ And you would say,
in your experience,

51:27.876 --> 51:32.089
pain is part of everyday life
in the mines?

51:32.089 --> 51:34.717
‐ Yes, it is.
Yes.

51:39.597 --> 51:43.892
‐ I‐I have, um, uh,
firsthand experience of pain.

51:43.892 --> 51:48.355
My father was diagnosed
with a rare form of cancer.

suffer through that

51:53.569 --> 51:56.363
was one of the‐‐the hardest
things that I've been through.

51:56.363 --> 51:58.866
You also have
firsthand experience

51:58.866 --> 52:00.701
with that kind of pain, right?

52:02.453 --> 52:05.539
Uh, my wife had cancer, um,

52:05.539 --> 52:11.086
and, uh, well, she passed away;
she didn't make it.

52:11.086 --> 52:12.713

52:12.713 --> 52:14.298

52:14.298 --> 52:18.844
was very helpful to her
in her final days, wasn't it?

52:18.844 --> 52:21.347
‐ It was.
It was‐‐it was helpful.

52:21.347 --> 52:24.600
That's why I wanted
to try OxyContin

52:24.600 --> 52:28.228
on my patients because, uh,
I don't want them to suffer.

52:28.228 --> 52:29.647
If there's a drug out there

52:29.647 --> 52:32.733
that can help them,
well, then I‐I want to try.

52:32.733 --> 52:36.612
‐ And the patients are wanting
to try it, too, right?

52:36.612 --> 52:38.781
‐ Heck yeah, they are.

52:38.781 --> 52:41.784

52:50.709 --> 52:53.587
I know most people don't,

they don't think about us
up there in the mountains.

52:56.256 --> 53:03.222
Uh, but these people,

53:03.222 --> 53:05.683
you know,

53:05.683 --> 53:07.893
when this country needed
to build airplanes,

53:07.893 --> 53:10.229
uh, during World War II
overnight,

53:10.229 --> 53:12.815
where‐‐where do you think
that steel came from?

53:12.815 --> 53:16.318
The bridges we drive across,
the high rises you live in,

53:16.318 --> 53:19.530

where we all watch football,

53:19.530 --> 53:21.865
that's all‐‐that's steel.

53:21.865 --> 53:23.784
And steel comes from coal.

53:25.953 --> 53:27.579
Um, I'm probably
talking too much.

53:27.579 --> 53:28.580
Am I talking too much?

53:28.580 --> 53:30.082
‐ No, please, please.

53:30.082 --> 53:34.211
‐ And who do you think digs
that coal out of the‐‐

53:34.211 --> 53:36.380
out of the mountains
in the hollows?

53:36.380 --> 53:38.382
My patients do.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.467
It's dangerous work, and...

53:40.467 --> 53:42.720
they risk their lives every day

53:42.720 --> 53:45.180
to keeps the lights on
in places like this.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.599
To keep the lights on
in the big cities.

53:47.599 --> 53:50.936
Keep the lights on
in your fine homes.

53:50.936 --> 53:52.938
And, uh, they carry the burden

53:52.938 --> 53:55.315
of building this nation
on their backs,

53:55.315 --> 53:57.276
and they deserve to do it
without pain.

and feed their families,

54:06.785 --> 54:11.248

is doing these people,

54:11.248 --> 54:15.586

so...
