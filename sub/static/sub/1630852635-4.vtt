WEBVTT

00:12.666 --> 00:14.333
[Asar] Turn your eyes.

00:14.416 --> 00:18.500
Her Royal Highness, Mirana,
daughter of Zal,

00:18.583 --> 00:23.375
Princess of the Sun. Gaze into her light.

00:25.708 --> 00:27.625
[crowd murmuring]

00:28.333 --> 00:30.375
The princess and I would have our privacy.

00:31.791 --> 00:33.000
Leave us to it.

00:33.083 --> 00:38.166
Your Majesty. I trust you received
my message from the viceroy.

00:38.250 --> 00:41.583
You're damn right, I did.
I'm imagining a state wedding,

00:41.666 --> 00:44.750
a state wedding
to redefine state weddings.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.875
We'll invite governors
from every province,

00:46.958 --> 00:50.083
demand a delegation
from every ally and trading partner.

00:50.166 --> 00:53.333
We'll spare no expense
to send the message far and wide,

00:53.416 --> 00:55.583
the Imperium is united.

00:56.291 --> 00:59.875
I said I accept your proposal,
you have not yet accepted mine.

01:00.583 --> 01:04.125
You want a wedding, I need an army.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.458
The army, huh?

01:06.458 --> 01:08.458
[pensive music playing]

01:11.958 --> 01:13.958
[theme music playing]

02:00.375 --> 02:01.500
[owl hooting]

02:02.208 --> 02:03.416
[Emperor Shabarra] Our daughter.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.208
You poisoned her against me.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.875
You made me a monster!

02:10.958 --> 02:12.541
Filomena's thoughts were her own.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.125
You needn't have said a single word.

02:16.791 --> 02:20.083
Your hatred seeped through you,
teaching her the same.

02:20.166 --> 02:24.416
There is no hate in that book. Only grief.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.916
Every morning and every night,
Filomena held that doll and prayed.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.500
She filled it with nothing but love

02:31.583 --> 02:35.333
and hope that someday,
her mother would return to her.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.250
She loved you until she died.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.208
[Selemene] She prayed.

02:48.291 --> 02:50.833
Auroth told me a human caravan
was passing through.

02:50.916 --> 02:53.791
-Heading south.
-And you're going to join them.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.375
After everything that's happened,
what I've done, what's started,

02:57.458 --> 03:00.875
I can't hide anymore. My people want war.

03:00.958 --> 03:04.541
I have to go back.
I have to try and stop it. But you…

03:05.291 --> 03:07.500
We'll be just fine. I promise.

03:08.875 --> 03:10.791
I still owe you so much.

03:12.541 --> 03:15.833
We either help people or we don't.
There is no ledger.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.125
[horses neigh]

03:19.208 --> 03:21.208
[indistinct chatter]

03:21.291 --> 03:23.375
[suspenseful music playing]

03:30.166 --> 03:31.000
[slurps]

03:35.166 --> 03:36.000
[clears throat]

03:36.500 --> 03:38.625
So, the elf girl left.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.083
Everyone does, eventually.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.083
Not everyone. Not always.

03:45.333 --> 03:49.291
Portal scroll. Keyed to my sword.
Say the words and I'll know.

03:49.375 --> 03:53.916
I'll come. Don't lose it.
With Father gone, those are precious.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.833
Yeah, I won't. I promise. Wait.

03:56.916 --> 04:00.125
Just to be clear, this doesn't
send me anywhere, right? Because…

04:01.583 --> 04:04.166
I love it. It's my favorite.

04:04.250 --> 04:07.916
-Thanks, I think we've got it.
-Well, good.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.291
[sighs]

04:13.916 --> 04:17.166
I lost 29 brothers
to that Eldwyrm inside you.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.500
I don't trust him. I never will.

04:20.583 --> 04:25.083
Do what you have to do.
Just remember who you are.

04:27.791 --> 04:31.416
[Rylai] Take this to my family's estate.
Auroth knows the way.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.833
All of this might sound better
coming from you.

04:33.916 --> 04:36.708
Nearly everything
sounds better coming from me.

04:36.791 --> 04:38.333
Except this.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.791
I can't get you an audience
with the Emperor.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.500
My sister can.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.375
Your sister. Lina, right? Father said--

04:46.458 --> 04:49.875
I know what Father said.
I know what father believed.

04:49.958 --> 04:55.083
How do you think I met Kaden?
Just tread lightly with Lina.

04:55.166 --> 04:59.375
-We didn't part on the best of terms.
-So, I shouldn't mention you?

04:59.458 --> 05:03.208
It's more, try not to say anything
particularly nice about me.

05:03.291 --> 05:05.208
[giggles]

05:05.291 --> 05:07.375
The two of you will get along famously.

05:07.458 --> 05:10.166
You remind me of her in some ways.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.208
You both want to save the world.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.708
You both think
you're the only one who can.

05:17.375 --> 05:20.666
Oh, I'm a terrible shrew!
Remember that when you see her.

05:21.875 --> 05:25.500
Four thousand spans to the Helio Imperium
on the back of a dragon.

05:25.583 --> 05:28.458
Could be worse.
You could be inside the dragon.

05:28.541 --> 05:29.583
You know, as lunch.

05:30.916 --> 05:34.166
-If she gets hungry, I'll save you.
-Ha-ha.

05:34.250 --> 05:38.875
I would never eat Bram.
We shared the dance of ritual combat.

05:38.958 --> 05:41.166
[Bram] You hear that?
She would never eat me.

05:41.250 --> 05:43.208
We are bonded as mates.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.666
We're bonded as mate-- Wait, I'm sorry?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.625
[Bram] "Ritual combat."
Sounds about right.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.958
[twang, whoosh]

06:00.500 --> 06:02.541
[suspenseful music playing]

06:07.416 --> 06:09.708
[girl giggling]

06:19.625 --> 06:20.541
[man whistles]

06:23.583 --> 06:24.791
[creaking]

06:24.875 --> 06:27.041
[growling]

06:27.125 --> 06:30.541
[rumbling]

06:35.125 --> 06:37.500
[tragic music playing]

06:37.583 --> 06:38.791
[woman screaming in distance]

06:38.875 --> 06:42.083
[splashing]

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
[suspenseful music playing]

06:56.500 --> 06:58.500
[people muttering]

07:01.791 --> 07:02.958
Is there a problem?

07:03.041 --> 07:05.833
What they're struggling to express

07:05.916 --> 07:08.500
is that they can't believe
you've come home.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.500
They're not alone.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.666
I'll be brief, Highness.

07:12.750 --> 07:18.291
You're welcome to sit in that chair.
We will bow, curtsy, and smile,

07:18.375 --> 07:23.666
but do not delude yourself into thinking
you have authority in this room.

07:23.750 --> 07:24.583
I see.

07:25.375 --> 07:29.916
Now, as to the so-called elven threat,
it's very simple.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.416
We will fortify the Enclave borders.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.500
More troops, a few more outposts.
They will try their tricks, of course.

07:37.083 --> 07:39.500
They will give us
the occasional bloody nose.

07:40.208 --> 07:44.458
Then they'll realize the futility
of it all and crawl back in their holes.

07:44.541 --> 07:48.333
Oh, yes, of course. Very simple.
And the Leylines?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.208
-The which?
-[Mirana] The Leylines.

07:51.291 --> 07:55.416
Dark for a thousand years,
kept dark by Selemene.

07:55.500 --> 08:00.125
If Selemene is gone,
if a new goddess rises in her place,

08:00.208 --> 08:03.125
your borders won't matter.
Your troops won't matter.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.500
Our army is the best in the world.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.291
I saw what one Enclave could do

08:08.375 --> 08:10.458
to an entire legion
of the Dark Moon Order.

08:10.541 --> 08:11.416
I was there.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.666
I fought them inch by blood-dimmed inch.
They showed no quarter, offered no mercy.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.416
They pursued us for hundreds of spans

08:19.500 --> 08:22.375
because they wanted to gut us
and hang us from the trees.

08:22.458 --> 08:26.791
We can't wait for them to come to us.
We must go to them.

08:26.875 --> 08:30.083
You're calling to invade
the Nightsilver Woods?

08:30.166 --> 08:33.291
And for what? To aid your goddess?

08:33.375 --> 08:37.083
You're insane. I won't allow it.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.291
Then you're dismissed.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.375
"Dismissed"?

08:42.750 --> 08:47.125
Council is concluded. Your Highness.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.000
[people muttering]

08:51.375 --> 08:53.125
[Viceroy Kashurra]
You are pushing too fast.

08:53.208 --> 08:57.083
Making pronouncements on things
you do not understand.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.083
You sacked Legatus Tihomir.

08:59.166 --> 09:02.833
[scoffs]
She has no combat experience.

09:02.916 --> 09:06.708
For god's sake, has she ever fought
more than a persistent cough?

09:06.791 --> 09:08.875
Just because she's rich.

09:08.958 --> 09:12.875
The richest woman in the Imperium
became Legatus of her own legion

09:12.958 --> 09:17.250
because she is largely responsible
for funding the rest of the army.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.583
You made an enemy.
A dangerous enemy, and for what?

09:22.666 --> 09:24.500
We don't have time to coddle them.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.166
[Viceroy Kashurra]
Your father was impatient too.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.375
[gasps]

09:28.458 --> 09:33.791
It profits nothing to move quickly
if you do not move wisely.

09:34.583 --> 09:36.500
Better quickly than not at all.

09:40.083 --> 09:42.500
[foreboding music playing]

09:42.583 --> 09:45.666
[indistinct chatter]

09:55.583 --> 09:56.625
[Luna grunts]

09:56.708 --> 09:59.041
We made a good team in the shower.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.666
I already thanked you.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.833
-In fact, uh, you never thanked me.
-Mm.

10:04.750 --> 10:08.375
-Is it the tail?
-[Luna] It's the rest of the equipment.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.000
Who wants out of this place?

10:14.958 --> 10:16.791
You're welcome.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.708
We didn't even get to celebrate
your last night as a bachelor.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.125
It's not funny.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.875
I'm just surprised.
I didn't know you could dance,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.500
much less perform
some kind of mating ritual.

10:27.583 --> 10:30.500
-You. You're gonna do this?
-What?

10:30.583 --> 10:34.125
You're gonna mock someone for having
a weird relationship with a dragon?

10:35.041 --> 10:36.208
[Davion] Fair point.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.125
[Auroth grunts]

10:42.708 --> 10:46.791
Come. I will show you the way
to Lina's family estate.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.958
Uh, I'm not sure going into the city
with a big, scary dragon-- Ah!

11:01.666 --> 11:02.791
[Bram] Hi.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.291
I mean, what?

11:06.375 --> 11:11.000
When my last dream of the thunder ended,
I awakened like this.

11:11.083 --> 11:15.083
I was wondering how such big claws
could write poetry with such a tiny pen.

11:15.166 --> 11:19.250
I thought, "Now there is a dragon
with very fine motor control."

11:19.333 --> 11:20.708
Mystery solved.

11:20.791 --> 11:25.125
There are too few mysteries in the world.
It is a sadness to solve them.

11:25.208 --> 11:28.250
Oh, trust me,
I'm confused by plenty of stuff.

11:34.208 --> 11:35.416
[crickets chirping]

11:35.916 --> 11:39.708
Hard to believe that each twinkle
represents another soul.

11:40.458 --> 11:46.333
Hope. Someone in the dark,
with fears, like you and I.

11:46.416 --> 11:52.666
So many different universes out there,
each wishing for just a little more light.

11:53.291 --> 11:57.666
-I'm sorry about earlier, Sunbeam.
-[Mirana] "Sunbeam."

11:57.750 --> 12:01.208
I'm not the little girl you helped escape
all those years ago.

12:01.291 --> 12:04.875
She would have looked at this city
and thought it was here for her.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.375
Now all I see is a place that seems
to have moved on without me.

12:08.458 --> 12:12.666
It has merely evolved,
as we must all evolve.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.166
While I was gone,

12:14.250 --> 12:18.458
I learned you can be
absolutely right and still lose.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.416
I'm not sure if that's evolution or luck.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.458
It is wisdom. The hardest earned.

12:24.541 --> 12:29.333
I've been playing with forces
and people I neither know nor understand.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.625
If I am to succeed, I need help.

12:33.541 --> 12:35.000
I need you to teach me.

12:35.083 --> 12:39.458
I love my father,
but I will not repeat his mistakes.

12:41.416 --> 12:43.541
[fire crackling]

12:48.166 --> 12:50.125
[Luna's advisor]
Sorry to bother you, Madam.

12:51.458 --> 12:56.000
There's a Dragon Knight at the door.
He aggressively wishes to speak with you.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.958
I thought the Dragon Knights
were all dead.

12:58.041 --> 13:03.375
[Luna's advisor] This one is alive, Madam.
He has your sister's symbol.

13:04.208 --> 13:07.208
[Davion] It's easy. You put your hand
on the knob and turn.

13:07.291 --> 13:08.666
You're in!

13:08.750 --> 13:11.958
The hell is going on… here?

13:12.041 --> 13:18.416
Uh, I'm Bram. A Dragon Knight.
And, and this is another Dragon Knight.

13:19.708 --> 13:24.250
Davion. He's, uh, he's a man of few words.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.333
[Bram] Listen, we have a big problem.

13:27.416 --> 13:30.791
-Davion has a big problem.
-Dragons.

13:30.875 --> 13:32.625
That is exactly where I was going.

13:32.708 --> 13:36.458
We finish each other's sentences.
Isn't that adorable?

13:36.541 --> 13:38.416
Hm. Adorable.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.666
I'm sorry, I, I feel like we've met.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.041
Same.

13:43.125 --> 13:46.708
So, dragons. Big dragon problem.

13:47.416 --> 13:52.208
Right. Yeah, see, the thing is,
I am the problem.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.333
[chuckles]
I find that easy to believe. Follow.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.125
[Davion] Oh!
Your sister is a terrible shrew.

13:59.208 --> 14:02.625
-[Luna] She told you to say that.
-[Davion] Yes, she did.

14:02.708 --> 14:04.750
[suspenseful music]

14:09.750 --> 14:11.958
This is no proper home for you.

14:14.333 --> 14:17.875
Here. Enjoy the flowers and the weeds.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.208
[thunder rumbles]

14:19.291 --> 14:20.833
[rain pattering]

14:22.583 --> 14:29.083
[Terrorblade] You promised me seven souls.
You have delivered only one.

14:30.125 --> 14:33.291
We are bound by a Shopkeeper covenant.

14:33.375 --> 14:36.083
I am bound only to collect the souls.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.041
We never specified
that I would relinquish them all.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.541
See, I know why you want them.
I know what it all means.

14:42.625 --> 14:46.833
And I am not so self-destructive
as to aid you in your efforts.

14:46.916 --> 14:48.500
[Terrorblade] Clever.

14:48.583 --> 14:52.875
You imagine yourself
the cleverest being in all of creation.

14:52.958 --> 14:56.083
Clever enough to expunge
your own name from it,

14:56.166 --> 14:58.791
and to make yourself untouchable by god…

15:00.458 --> 15:02.708
man, or me.

15:03.291 --> 15:08.708
Your intellect protects you from harm
in exchange for loneliness.

15:08.791 --> 15:13.791
I see you. I know you.

15:13.875 --> 15:17.333
In countless realities, you are the same,

15:17.416 --> 15:22.208
a broken old man desperate
to conceal his agony.

15:22.291 --> 15:28.500
We bargain, you lie. You change the terms.

15:28.583 --> 15:33.000
You fail to consider
that I see everything,

15:33.083 --> 15:37.416
and all of this is part of my plan.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.916
Interesting.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.833
And in how many realities
do you and I have this conversation?

15:41.916 --> 15:45.125
In how many does the game progress so far?

15:45.208 --> 15:47.375
[Invoker] Only this one.

15:47.458 --> 15:51.625
What you can see, I can imagine.
We are evenly matched.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.750
And the girl?

15:56.125 --> 15:57.916
The girl?
[chuckles]

15:58.625 --> 16:02.500
The elf. Well, she's a means
to an end and nothing more.

16:02.583 --> 16:03.541
A pawn.

16:03.625 --> 16:07.833
[Terrorblade] I know her name.
Her true name.

16:07.916 --> 16:14.541
And the place she occupies.
A hole left by a little child.

16:14.625 --> 16:17.375
A victim of her father's failure.

16:18.125 --> 16:20.208
Resist all you like.

16:20.291 --> 16:26.250
In the end, you will beg me
to take the dragon souls from you.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.958
[rain pattering]

16:33.958 --> 16:35.958
The little squirrel
couldn't go back to the tree,

16:37.000 --> 16:39.125
even though he'd spent
his whole life there.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.750
-[baby coos]
-[sighs]

16:41.625 --> 16:43.666
[dad] Ah, she's a good sleeper.

16:44.333 --> 16:49.083
-This story, how does it end?
-It's the Tree of Lore. Everyone knows it.

16:49.166 --> 16:51.500
-[Fymryn] My childhood was very sheltered.
-[sighs]

16:52.708 --> 16:54.333
[dad] Every childhood should be.

16:54.416 --> 16:57.208
The squirrel, he did something bad.

16:57.291 --> 17:00.750
Ruined his tree.
But he does fix it, doesn't he?

17:00.833 --> 17:05.166
No. Some things cannot be fixed.
Deeds cannot be undone.

17:05.250 --> 17:08.791
They become stories.
Lore. Leaves on the tree.

17:09.416 --> 17:12.875
Ah, the squirrel
learns to stand in its shade,

17:12.958 --> 17:16.666
knowing even tragedy
can grow into something beautiful.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.041
Can I hold her?

17:20.125 --> 17:22.291
[rumbling]

17:24.791 --> 17:27.458
[Lina] You don't look big enough
to carry around a whole Eldwyrm.

17:27.541 --> 17:31.333
I can't. Not forever.
That's what makes this so urgent.

17:31.416 --> 17:34.416
Slyrak needs the eye. I need an audience.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.208
The Emperor. He's a small man. Weak.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.875
Convincing him won't be easy.
We have to make him feel like…

17:41.958 --> 17:43.208
[both] He's stronger for it.

17:45.041 --> 17:48.750
Yeah. But no one refuses a Dragon Knight.

17:48.833 --> 17:52.166
Not bartenders, not kings,
not even emperors.

17:52.250 --> 17:55.708
[chuckles]
"Bartenders." That is impressive.

17:56.208 --> 18:00.333
I'll take you to the little man.
It'll be fun to watch him squirm.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.416
[metal creaking]

18:03.958 --> 18:05.125
[thuds]

18:06.458 --> 18:08.291
-Oh, shit!
-Close the--

18:08.375 --> 18:10.208
[grunting]

18:10.291 --> 18:11.458
[grunts]

18:11.541 --> 18:13.166
[whirring]

18:13.250 --> 18:16.708
[bells toll]

18:18.458 --> 18:19.750
[groans]

18:20.541 --> 18:21.625
[thuds]

18:22.125 --> 18:23.083
[grunts]

18:27.166 --> 18:28.208
[guards scream]

18:32.666 --> 18:34.083
[grunting]

18:34.666 --> 18:35.750
[groans]

18:36.250 --> 18:38.666
-[rumbling]
-[men gasp]

18:39.833 --> 18:40.750
[Luna scoffs]

18:41.333 --> 18:42.333
[head guard] Ready spears!

18:42.416 --> 18:43.666
[guards] Ready spears!

18:43.750 --> 18:45.166
[head guard] Ready crossbows!

18:45.250 --> 18:47.250
[guards] Ready crossbows!

18:47.333 --> 18:49.791
Kill them! Kill them all!

18:53.250 --> 18:55.666
[thrilling music playing]

18:58.791 --> 19:00.333
[door whirring]

19:04.708 --> 19:05.625
[growls]

19:09.916 --> 19:10.875
[flare crackles]

19:12.583 --> 19:14.916
[Davion] One flare
doesn't seem like much of a party.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.250
[Lina] It's a signal.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.583
It's for me.

19:18.666 --> 19:21.833
In the mood for a little
spontaneous human combustion?

19:21.916 --> 19:23.583
[screaming]

19:24.166 --> 19:25.250
[grunts]

19:26.166 --> 19:27.583
[pants]

19:31.375 --> 19:33.708
-We head for the spire.
-[Hieronimo] No, no, no…

19:33.791 --> 19:36.416
The spire is the opposite direction
of which we should run.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.625
Suit yourself.
I have a princess to rescue.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.208
A princess? Well, you should have said so.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.416
[Lina's incantation]

19:48.833 --> 19:50.166
[Lina grunts]

19:53.708 --> 19:55.000
[screams]

20:01.416 --> 20:02.625
[Jarl] The Slayer.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.916
[tense music playing]

20:11.416 --> 20:13.458
[footsteps approaching]

20:16.000 --> 20:17.291
That isn't possible.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.375
-I know. Is that a turtle, or--
-Stay here.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.375
Davion, the turtle is now worth the--
[screams]

20:25.500 --> 20:26.833
[yelps, blows]

20:28.833 --> 20:29.833
[sighs]

20:30.458 --> 20:32.708
[bells toll]

20:34.875 --> 20:36.958
Luna. What have you done?

20:39.083 --> 20:41.916
Hey! I just wanna know about Mirana.

20:42.666 --> 20:43.833
-[grunts]
-[groans]

20:43.916 --> 20:45.458
[Hieronimo] Stay down, long pig.

20:45.541 --> 20:47.583
That was unnecessary.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.708
-Ah, you know him?
-He knows the princess.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.416
-How well?
-I gather very well.

20:54.500 --> 20:55.375
[groans]

21:00.625 --> 21:03.750
[breathes heavily]

21:03.833 --> 21:06.083
I married the right dragon.

21:06.166 --> 21:08.541
-What?
-We're not really mated.

21:08.625 --> 21:11.458
I'm inexperienced with human humor.

21:11.541 --> 21:15.333
I'm sorry. I hope you're not angry.

21:15.416 --> 21:18.416
Well, honestly,
it was nice while it lasted.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.083
You could do that, so…

21:21.416 --> 21:25.583
You really are adorable for a mouse
who is too easily crushed.

21:25.666 --> 21:28.583
[Bram] Well, not easily crushed.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.250
[indistinct chatter in distance]

21:38.791 --> 21:41.666
Well, you look like
the top of a cake no one's eating.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.666
Oh, you smell like a sewer.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.125
[sniffs]

21:50.208 --> 21:52.541
I bathed. Once.

21:54.083 --> 21:55.416
[gasps]

21:59.583 --> 22:00.791
Hi.

22:01.541 --> 22:02.666
Hi.

22:04.791 --> 22:06.750
-We need to go.
-I can't.

22:06.833 --> 22:09.416
You can. You just walk out the door
and pick a direction.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.791
How about someone tells me
what is going on?

22:11.875 --> 22:12.791
Uh.

22:12.875 --> 22:16.125
Lovers' quarrel, I suspect.
This explains much.

22:16.208 --> 22:21.458
I'm not a prisoner.
I found a way to return home.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.583
I can fix everything.
But I need to stay here.

22:25.166 --> 22:28.500
-That isn't an option for me.
-Definitely not.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.583
I know a secret way. Follow me.

22:30.666 --> 22:31.916
[grunts]

22:32.708 --> 22:35.291
[tragic music playing]

22:39.333 --> 22:40.791
No. No.

22:42.083 --> 22:42.916
[sobs]

22:46.666 --> 22:47.916
No, no.

22:48.541 --> 22:50.208
No, no, no, no…

22:52.958 --> 22:55.291
The arrow. It came from there.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.541
[Hieronimo] A fight is coming.
The princess is dead.

23:02.625 --> 23:04.166
Luna, listen to me.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.333
[grunts]

23:05.416 --> 23:07.041
Ah, to hells with you.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.916
-[Luna screams]
-[Hieronimo grunts]

23:13.291 --> 23:15.166
[both groan]

23:19.458 --> 23:20.416
[groans]

23:22.000 --> 23:24.583
-You can mourn later.
-I don't want to mourn.

23:24.666 --> 23:26.833
I want blood.

23:28.208 --> 23:33.583
Put the princess down,
or I swear, by the eyes of my fathers,

23:33.666 --> 23:35.958
-I will carve the bones from you.
-[growls]

23:36.041 --> 23:36.875
[gasps]

23:50.958 --> 23:52.958
[closing theme music playing]
