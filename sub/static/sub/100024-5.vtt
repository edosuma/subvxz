28:14.562 --> 28:16.520
Oh, the stamina!

28:16.564 --> 28:18.087
Mm.

28:19.132 --> 28:21.221
Mm.

28:23.571 --> 28:27.662
[Mrs. Kelly] Oh, my God,
oh, that hair!

28:27.706 --> 28:30.360
[Mr. Kelly] What a handsome
young man you've become.

28:30.404 --> 28:32.232
I'll go get the camera!

28:36.062 --> 28:38.238
Let me help you.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.376
I'll show you
as many times as you need,

28:47.682 --> 28:49.858
but it's simple,

28:49.902 --> 28:54.428
you start with the back side
of the tie facing away from you.

29:03.524 --> 29:07.397
Marissa, I get the
feeling you're like me.

29:08.834 --> 29:12.663
You, we, see what's...

29:14.274 --> 29:17.103
special about Seren.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.152
What's special.

29:29.463 --> 29:32.118
Sometimes he just needs
a little reminder.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.383
[Mrs. Kelly]
Outside everybody!

29:36.426 --> 29:38.385
I know the sun's going down,
but I'll be damned

29:38.428 --> 29:40.561
if I don't get a picture
by the bougainvillea.

29:42.911 --> 29:44.652
One moment, Marissa.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.444
Don't give away the farm.

30:10.983 --> 30:13.986
Closer! Closer.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.944
Come on Ms. Cueva,
get in one!

30:15.988 --> 30:17.467
Ma, we have to go.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.949
-We're gonna miss the bus.
-The bus?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.821
I borrowed Ms. Elijah's car,

30:22.864 --> 30:25.824
I'm driving you two, hey!

30:26.520 --> 30:31.786
[rap music playing]

30:52.720 --> 30:53.939
[Seren] Hey!

30:56.942 --> 30:58.813
This is Tare.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.249
Seren, Marissa.

31:00.293 --> 31:03.862
-It's so nice to meet you!
-You too.

31:05.820 --> 31:09.215
So, ya'll go
to school with Dai?

31:09.258 --> 31:12.566
-Who's Dai?
-[suspense music]

31:13.741 --> 31:15.917
Dai, right here.

31:17.701 --> 31:20.879
-You mean DJ?
-Yeah.

31:20.922 --> 31:23.707
[loud crashing]

31:25.405 --> 31:28.364
I mean, Dai,
that sounds nice.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.982
-Why your tie pink?
-To match my dress.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.637
I love a pink tie.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.726
And Marissa,
I love your hair.

31:42.770 --> 31:45.599
Dai didn't tell me
his friends were so cool.

31:51.561 --> 31:54.608
-Where's the bathroom?
-You know, I was about to go.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.566
-I'll show you.
-Perfect.

32:00.788 --> 32:02.921
Are you wearing
cucumber Dove?

32:04.183 --> 32:06.359
[loud banging]

32:07.142 --> 32:09.014
[dance music playing]

32:14.193 --> 32:16.238
I'm applying to
New World for dance.

32:16.282 --> 32:20.068
Mrs. Evert, I know,
she runs their program,
I know her.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.765
I think she'll love you.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.767
Oh, you haven't
even seen me move.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.335
[Dr. Woods] Well, I'm sure
I'll be impressed.

32:26.379 --> 32:29.338
David's gonna go to Hurston.

32:29.382 --> 32:30.687
I know that's what he'd like.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.254
[Tare]
I have no idea why.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.475
Who wants to go to a sleep away
school with all those boys?

32:35.518 --> 32:37.781
[chuckling] Have you and
David known each other long?

32:37.825 --> 32:39.696
Mm-hmm, we both
live in The Ville!

32:39.740 --> 32:41.263
He used to run around
with this group of boys

32:41.307 --> 32:43.309
and one of them
was always coming up

32:43.352 --> 32:45.746
and lifting girls shirts,
David was following

32:45.789 --> 32:47.617
-right behind them.
-Let's dance!

32:47.661 --> 32:52.448
-Oh okay, bye WT!
-[chuckles] Bye!

32:53.667 --> 32:55.234
Why didn't you let me
finish the story

32:55.277 --> 32:56.975
about how we first met?

32:57.018 --> 32:59.455
You shoved that kid who was
about to grab me, remember?

32:59.499 --> 33:03.068
-My Superman.
-Oh, I forgot.

33:03.111 --> 33:04.634
Come on, Dai.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.941
You the one that
wanted to dance!

33:06.985 --> 33:09.988
[upbeat music]

33:13.556 --> 33:18.997
-[soft music fades in]
-[steady heartbeat]

33:27.005 --> 33:29.311
-Dai!
-What?

33:29.355 --> 33:32.010
Did you see that there's
a chocolate fountain?

33:34.534 --> 33:38.364
[dance music playing]

33:44.892 --> 33:46.633
Pussy.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.465
Don't worry about them.

33:52.508 --> 33:55.772
They're just mad because
you're special, and they aren't.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.736
Ma is not going to believe

34:02.779 --> 34:04.216
that there was a real
chocolate fountain

34:04.259 --> 34:07.654
with marshmallows and
strawberries, like in movies.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.134
Ooh, I can't wait
to tell Shella.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.397
She's gone be hateful!

34:11.440 --> 34:13.486
Why would you tell Shella?

34:13.529 --> 34:14.878
Why would I not?

34:14.922 --> 34:17.577
It's just, with Shella,
once she knows something

34:17.620 --> 34:20.188
the whole Ville
gonna know about it.

34:20.232 --> 34:23.365
And they can't know because?

34:23.409 --> 34:25.976
I mean, it's not like
they can't know,

34:26.020 --> 34:29.850
I just feel like,
can't things just be private?

34:31.678 --> 34:34.855
Oh, my God,
you're ashamed of me.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.552
That's why you been
actin weird all night.

34:36.596 --> 34:40.600
-No, no, it's just--
-You just, you just what?

34:40.643 --> 34:42.123
Now that I'm here
I embarrass you

34:42.167 --> 34:44.386
in front of your little
magnet school friends?

34:44.430 --> 34:45.866
No, it's Shinobi and them!

34:45.909 --> 34:47.389
Oh, you don't want
them to know?

34:47.433 --> 34:49.261
Kill your hard-ass
dope-dealer rep?

34:49.304 --> 34:50.566
Tare, please!

34:50.610 --> 34:53.526
Nuh-uh,
I'm too good for this!

35:00.620 --> 35:03.144
[somber music]

35:17.767 --> 35:20.814
[frog chirping]

35:23.164 --> 35:25.514
[Sky] You know what
that noise mean?

35:27.037 --> 35:32.565
Matin' season. Hey!
[chuckling]

35:34.654 --> 35:36.656
You a'ight?

35:37.700 --> 35:39.311
I'm mad I can't be normal.

35:39.354 --> 35:40.834
Fuck normal.

35:41.835 --> 35:44.490
Name one person you like
that's normal?

35:45.882 --> 35:49.582
-I like you.
-Point!

35:49.625 --> 35:51.671
I am the opposite of the word.

35:52.976 --> 35:55.327
Look, Dai,
it's all right, man.

35:56.328 --> 36:00.158
This light work,
just school and your girl.

36:01.681 --> 36:04.336
[laughing] Look at you.

36:04.379 --> 36:08.035
Hanging your head so hard
you fittin' to break your neck.

36:12.213 --> 36:17.000
I'm sorry,
I fuck everything up.

36:35.410 --> 36:36.803
[frog chirps]

36:36.846 --> 36:40.067
-Oh, my God!
-Don't be scared.

36:40.676 --> 36:41.982
It won't hurt you!

36:43.288 --> 36:44.637
Do you wanna hold it?

36:46.334 --> 36:48.597
Oh no,
you couldn't pay me.

36:48.641 --> 36:51.252
I'll keep it away from you.

36:51.296 --> 36:56.910
I just wanna make sure
it gets outside safe, okay?

37:01.567 --> 37:03.133
Can I sit?

37:15.276 --> 37:18.323
You know that girl
Marissa likes you, right?

37:18.366 --> 37:19.411
What?

37:19.454 --> 37:22.762
Nah, no way, uh-uh!

37:22.805 --> 37:24.198
Then why'd she look at me

37:24.242 --> 37:26.896
like she was tryna cut me
when I walked in?

37:26.940 --> 37:30.117
That's crazy,
she can't stand me.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.860
But Seren's nice.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.558
It's cool that you
got a gay friend.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.256
He ain't.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.910
You're only sayin' that
'cause he light-skinned.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.651
[laughing]

37:42.695 --> 37:46.394
I see things,
don't get it twisted.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.136
He seems like
a really good friend.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.664
So...

37:56.665 --> 38:00.626
-you still mad or what?
-[laughing]

38:13.203 --> 38:15.293
Wait!

38:17.251 --> 38:19.166
I'ma miss you, man!

38:20.472 --> 38:22.865
Only boys play with those.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.824
You're a little man now.

38:24.867 --> 38:27.653
-Right?
-Right.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.410
Any last words?

38:47.542 --> 38:51.633
Okay then, now you're cured.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.680
No more pissy sheets!

38:54.723 --> 38:57.683
[chuckling]

39:03.428 --> 39:05.386
Um...

39:05.430 --> 39:07.083
Thanks for coming.

39:07.127 --> 39:11.174
You owe me, I still haven't
had a fondue fountain.

39:23.709 --> 39:27.190
[Ms. Cueva coughing]

39:29.454 --> 39:30.803
Bye, Dai.

[tires screeching]

39:54.783 --> 39:59.092
[guys laughing and chattering]

40:16.805 --> 40:19.895
[Sky] I was too young
when I had a kid.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.813
Fuckin' round with Angie.

40:25.988 --> 40:27.990
Pussy got me stuck.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.430
That boy down there,

40:32.473 --> 40:34.954
more like my little
brother than my son.

40:36.129 --> 40:39.088
And that ain't how you're
supposed to raise a kid.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.791
That's life though.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.142
Doing things you don't want to.

40:54.234 --> 40:56.018
Fuck man...

40:57.542 --> 40:59.457
I fuck everything up.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.855
Well, almost everything.

41:26.658 --> 41:30.226
[Gloria and JG giggling]

41:36.406 --> 41:38.452
David?

41:41.150 --> 41:43.283
[intense music]
