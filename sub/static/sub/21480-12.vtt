00:39.367 --> 00:41.767
We're not a threat.
We're salvation.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.968
The world
will have to deal with us.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.434
<i>Previously on the 4400...</i>

00:47.434 --> 00:49.167
this is where
i give you the speech

00:49.167 --> 00:51.100
about how you're
my best field scientist

00:51.100 --> 00:52.534
and tom is my best
lead investigator,

00:52.534 --> 00:53.767
and how together,

00:53.767 --> 00:55.400
you're going to make
a good team.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.934
Let me see
if i've got this straight...

00:56.934 --> 00:58.767
you two met,
fell in love,

00:58.767 --> 01:00.167
and spent eight years together

01:00.167 --> 01:01.667
in some kind
of alternate reality.

01:01.667 --> 01:02.801
Yeah.

01:02.801 --> 01:03.834
What time is the flight?

01:03.834 --> 01:04.801
Uh, noon.

01:04.801 --> 01:06.234
Say goodbye to mom for me.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.334
They arrested a suspect
40 minutes ago.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.567
Claim he's our guy.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.467
[Jarvis]: Roy keith marsden.

01:11.467 --> 01:13.033
Forget about the flight.
Bring kyle home.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.934
They just arrested a suspect
in the collier killing.

01:14.934 --> 01:16.367
It's going to feel
a little weird,

01:16.367 --> 01:17.567
but when we're done,

01:17.567 --> 01:18.634
you'll be able
to see again.

01:18.634 --> 01:20.801
When does it start?

01:20.801 --> 01:21.767
When do i see again?

01:21.767 --> 01:23.467
Just give me one moment, okay?

01:23.467 --> 01:25.267
Kevin's a genius, you know.

01:27.801 --> 01:28.834
You're saying that burkhoff

01:28.834 --> 01:30.234
is the father
of the 4400 technology.

01:30.234 --> 01:32.601
I can think again, too.

01:32.601 --> 01:33.501
You've got
a real fever,

01:33.501 --> 01:34.467
young lady.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.534
I worked at the C.D.C.
For seven years,

01:36.534 --> 01:38.601
and i never saw
anything like it.

01:38.601 --> 01:41.701
I was changing her.
She has these marks on her skin.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.667
Marks? Bruises?

01:43.667 --> 01:44.801
No. Like irritations.

01:44.801 --> 01:47.300
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.200
What did i just tell you?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.667
[Jarvis]: You're in charge
until i'm released.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.067
Pool whatever manpower
is still up walking.

01:54.067 --> 01:55.367
Start picking up the pieces.

01:55.367 --> 01:57.968
I'll handle it.
Don't worry about it.

02:02.267 --> 02:03.468
[Tom]:
Okay, seriously,

02:03.468 --> 02:05.600
my back is about
to call it a day.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.468
Just come on...

02:07.468 --> 02:09.033
you're not helping.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.201
Where's this going?

02:10.201 --> 02:11.334
Right there.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.501
Please say
that was the last box.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.600
That's it.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.367
We're officially
living in sin.

02:18.367 --> 02:19.733
Oh, really.

02:19.733 --> 02:21.067
Well, i prefer to call it

02:21.067 --> 02:22.401
"resuming
our eight-year marriage."

02:22.401 --> 02:24.434
Call it whatever you want.

02:24.434 --> 02:26.434
Just don't kiss
in front of me again, okay?

02:26.434 --> 02:27.967
That's disgusting.

02:31.367 --> 02:33.501
Oh, your father thinks
this is so romantic,

02:33.501 --> 02:34.900
but what
he doesn't know

02:34.900 --> 02:36.201
is the reason
i'm moving in

02:36.201 --> 02:38.201
is to take down
his tacky golf stuff.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.401
[Tom]: What?

02:39.401 --> 02:40.600
And replace it
with what?

02:40.600 --> 02:43.067
Oh, oh,
paint splatters?

02:43.067 --> 02:46.034
Maybe a picture
of a triangle

02:46.034 --> 02:47.134
kids!
It's art.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.700
Work out
these decorating issues

02:48.700 --> 02:49.700
amongst yourselves,

02:49.700 --> 02:51.633
but i'm dead serious

02:51.633 --> 02:52.767
about this kissing rule, okay?

02:52.767 --> 02:54.101
It's non-negotiable.

02:57.134 --> 02:58.334
Oh, kyle,

02:58.334 --> 03:00.101
my allergies are
bothering me again.

03:00.101 --> 03:01.667
Could you write me
another prescription

03:01.667 --> 03:02.600
before you go?

03:03.767 --> 03:05.234
Uh, alana...

03:05.234 --> 03:08.267
kyle's only a doctor
in the world you created for me,

03:08.267 --> 03:09.733
remember?

03:12.867 --> 03:14.000
I'm sorry.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.167
I had a brain freeze.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.367
Right.

03:31.201 --> 03:33.834
Trying to decipher
my handwriting?

03:33.834 --> 03:36.600
I was just on the verge
of giving up, actually.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.633
Good.

03:37.633 --> 03:38.867
Bad penmanship
is the best way

03:38.867 --> 03:40.534
for a doctor to keep
his mystique.

03:40.534 --> 03:43.733
There's a page missing
in there.

03:43.733 --> 03:46.434
It goes from page four
to page six.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.900
Sorry.
I'm breaking in a new nurse.

03:48.900 --> 03:51.934
So listen, i think
we finally know

03:51.934 --> 03:53.834
what's wrong
with your daughter.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.301
Maia's suffering
from a type of pneumonia

03:57.301 --> 03:59.101
called pneumocystis jiroveci.

03:59.101 --> 04:00.800
It's "p.j.p."
For short.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.900
I've never heard of it.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.101
It's rare,

04:03.101 --> 04:04.667
but we can treat it...

04:04.667 --> 04:05.834
well, thank god.

04:05.834 --> 04:08.401
But this kind
of pneumonia

04:08.401 --> 04:10.401
could be a symptom
for something more serious.

04:10.401 --> 04:12.633
We've tested her
for every virus...

04:12.633 --> 04:13.867
all negative.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.233
So where is it coming from?

04:16.233 --> 04:18.067
We don't know,
but we're running more tests.

04:18.067 --> 04:19.468
We'll figure it out.

04:21.434 --> 04:22.501
It's not that big
of a deal.

04:22.501 --> 04:23.700
You know, i've just...

04:23.700 --> 04:25.633
i've been working
real hard lately.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.568
I think i got the flu
or something.

04:28.568 --> 04:30.101
Everybody gets that,
right?

04:30.101 --> 04:32.468
Sure. It's just...

04:34.501 --> 04:36.468
shawn...

04:36.468 --> 04:38.301
you can't heal.

04:38.301 --> 04:41.267
For now.

04:41.267 --> 04:43.800
I think you should
get it checked out.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.468
If i can't kick it
in a day or two, i will,

04:46.468 --> 04:48.034
but, uh...

04:48.034 --> 04:50.301
until then,
can you reschedule

04:50.301 --> 04:51.800
all my foundation
appointments?

04:51.800 --> 04:53.600
Tell them that it's temporary.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.568
Make sure they know that.

04:57.767 --> 04:58.800
Lily...

05:00.867 --> 05:03.434
don't tell anyone
i can't heal.

05:03.434 --> 05:06.267
Sure.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.167
Thank you.

05:13.867 --> 05:15.867
Lily...

05:15.867 --> 05:17.401
i mean it. Nobody.

05:32.468 --> 05:34.201
Oh, god.

05:43.334 --> 05:45.101
Ah...

06:05.167 --> 06:08.334
[Speaking german]

06:17.468 --> 06:18.967
[Tom]: How many
are sick?

06:18.967 --> 06:20.367
300... that we know of.

06:20.367 --> 06:21.967
Medical says
more calls keep coming in.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.568
So, what is it?

06:23.568 --> 06:25.468
Well, it's some kind
of immune system disorder,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.234
and it's leaving the 4400
vulnerable

06:27.234 --> 06:29.633
to all kinds of diseases.

06:29.633 --> 06:31.201
His plane landed
at seatac

06:31.201 --> 06:32.334
on schedule.

06:32.334 --> 06:33.667
Chopper should be here
any minute.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.367
What's that?

06:35.367 --> 06:38.834
They told me
he likes green tea.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.867
Is it contagious?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.267
We don't know.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.468
Were they infected
while they were gone?

06:42.468 --> 06:43.733
Maybe they brought this
back with them.

06:43.733 --> 06:45.934
Well, maybe.
We just don't know.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.167
The situation is fluid,

06:50.167 --> 06:53.600
but here's a summary
of what we know so far.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.900
Uh, sir?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.934
They told me
you'd want this.

06:56.934 --> 06:57.867
The numbers just keep
getting bigger.

06:57.867 --> 06:58.900
So we're recovering

06:58.900 --> 06:59.600
from an attack
on this building...

07:02.867 --> 07:04.700
the division commander's
still in the hospital...

07:08.401 --> 07:09.867
what are we
supposed to do?

07:09.867 --> 07:12.334
We take to the field.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.434
Ryland?
Where did he
come from?

07:17.101 --> 07:19.468
We're going to have
every 4400 in this jurisdiction

07:19.468 --> 07:21.600
tested
for this sickness

07:21.600 --> 07:23.134
by day's end.

07:23.134 --> 07:24.401
Dennis, is it good to see you.

07:24.401 --> 07:25.633
Tom.

07:25.633 --> 07:26.967
Diana.

07:26.967 --> 07:28.501
What brings you
to seattle, ryland?

07:28.501 --> 07:30.867
I'm assuming temporary command
of this division.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.234
My orders are to do something

07:32.234 --> 07:34.367
about the spread
of this epidemic.

07:34.367 --> 07:39.067
I'm going to figure out a way
to do just that.

07:49.234 --> 07:54.600
* so long ago, another life *

07:54.600 --> 07:58.534
* i can feel your heart beat *

07:58.534 --> 08:04.000
* it's not a dream
remember us *

08:04.000 --> 08:08.334
* i can see it in your eyes *

08:08.334 --> 08:11.534
* we'll find our place in time *

08:11.534 --> 08:17.167
* our place in time
beyond the sun *

08:17.167 --> 08:20.800
* we'll find our place in time *

08:20.800 --> 08:26.201
* our place in time
to call our own *

08:40.501 --> 08:41.734
You might want
to move that,

08:41.734 --> 08:46.300
unless you want people
calling you "Nina."

08:46.300 --> 08:47.534
How's jarvis doing?

08:47.534 --> 08:49.067
They set her collarbone.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.401
Doctors said
she'll be back in two weeks.

08:51.401 --> 08:52.567
My guess?

08:52.567 --> 08:53.768
She makes it in one.

08:53.768 --> 08:55.200
Yeah.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.567
So how's d.c.?

08:57.567 --> 08:59.933
Oh, it's a lot of networking.

08:59.933 --> 09:01.401
Lots of dinner parties.

09:01.401 --> 09:02.667
Patty loves it.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.868
And you?

09:03.868 --> 09:06.601
The pacific northwest
is the flashpoint.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.234
I kind of feel

09:08.234 --> 09:10.100
like i was promoted
out of the game.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.434
A lot of guys here
would trade places with you.

09:12.434 --> 09:13.900
I wouldn't blame them.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.734
A woman releases plague
into the air?

09:16.734 --> 09:19.734
A terrorist attack
on the building?

09:19.734 --> 09:21.167
Some people i work for

09:21.167 --> 09:22.501
think you're
in the middle of a war.

09:22.501 --> 09:24.134
I'm sure
it looks that way on paper.

09:24.134 --> 09:25.601
Don't get defensive.

09:25.601 --> 09:28.334
I'm still preaching the gospel
of highland beach.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.100
I still believe

09:30.100 --> 09:32.300
the 4400 came back here
to change things for the better.

09:32.300 --> 09:33.401
Yeah, and the people
you work for?

09:33.401 --> 09:34.534
Don't worry
about them.

09:34.534 --> 09:36.067
One day, this'll be over,

09:36.067 --> 09:37.667
we'll go out for a beer,

09:37.667 --> 09:40.000
we'll kick back,
we'll trade war stories.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.601
Yeah.

09:43.134 --> 09:44.967
[Ruth]: She was a little cranky
this morning.

09:44.967 --> 09:46.100
I think
she's cutting another tooth.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.401
They're
coming in fast, huh?

09:47.401 --> 09:48.933
She's that age.

09:48.933 --> 09:50.801
Bye, bye, sweetie.

09:50.801 --> 09:52.334
We'll see you tomorrow.

09:52.334 --> 09:53.967
Thank you, ruth.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.467
Lily, what are you doing?

10:01.467 --> 10:03.534
I thought we agreed

10:03.534 --> 10:05.334
nobody was doing
science experiments on our baby.

10:05.334 --> 10:06.967
Just making sure.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.868
Shawn, we need to rearrange
your healing schedule.

10:10.868 --> 10:12.367
There's something going on,

10:12.367 --> 10:15.033
some sort of illness
spreading among the 4400.

10:17.267 --> 10:19.634
I know all about it.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.167
You.

11:02.167 --> 11:03.334
Did you do this?

11:03.334 --> 11:04.734
No, no. It wasn't me.

11:04.734 --> 11:05.900
Then what are you doing here?

11:05.900 --> 11:08.634
I read about this place
in the paper.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.100
I just... i was curious.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.167
Yeah?

11:11.167 --> 11:12.200
Well, go be curious
somewhere else,

11:12.200 --> 11:13.467
because people
still live here, okay?

11:18.567 --> 11:19.900
Do you need some help?

11:19.900 --> 11:21.634
What, are you
a mechanic now?

11:21.634 --> 11:24.267
I can change a tire.

11:26.367 --> 11:27.567
There's probably a jack
in the trunk, right?

11:30.267 --> 11:32.100
Yeah.

11:35.634 --> 11:38.100
I'm sorry i snapped at you.

11:38.100 --> 11:41.534
I just... i'm in a hurry, and...

11:41.534 --> 11:43.200
my boyfriend's little brother

11:43.200 --> 11:44.768
is in the principal's office
again,

11:44.768 --> 11:46.834
and he's... not here...

11:46.834 --> 11:48.033
again.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.801
I guess he's in
a lot of trouble, huh?

11:54.801 --> 11:57.667
Yeah.

11:57.667 --> 12:01.067
Yeah, you could say that.

12:04.434 --> 12:05.801
Well, i mean,
it's none of my business.

12:05.801 --> 12:08.534
I can just change the tire
and go.

12:10.267 --> 12:11.900
Please.

12:19.701 --> 12:20.933
Hi there.

12:20.933 --> 12:22.033
Welcome to the center.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.033
Are you here to take the tour?

12:24.033 --> 12:25.234
This is wrong.

12:25.234 --> 12:26.801
It's all wrong.

12:26.801 --> 12:28.067
Excuse me?

12:28.067 --> 12:29.868
This is
the collier museum.

12:29.868 --> 12:32.334
Where are
all the paintings?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.467
Thomas.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.033
Hey, sweetie.
What's going on?

12:43.033 --> 12:45.933
I have a board of directors
meeting,

12:45.933 --> 12:47.567
and they won't let me
go upstairs.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.067
Yeah, yeah.
They called me.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.167
They said you were
a little mixed up.

12:51.734 --> 12:53.634
Alana...

12:53.634 --> 12:56.134
this isn't
the collier museum.

12:56.134 --> 12:58.467
It's...
it's the 4400 center.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.367
What are you
talking about?

13:00.367 --> 13:01.801
I come here
all the time.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.868
Look at me. Look...

13:03.868 --> 13:05.401
alana...

13:05.401 --> 13:07.667
the place
you're thinking of,

13:07.667 --> 13:09.000
it's somewhere else.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.134
No. No!

13:13.134 --> 13:15.200
Why are you
confusing me?

13:15.200 --> 13:16.467
Just calm down!
No!

13:16.467 --> 13:18.067
It's okay.
It's all right.

13:26.768 --> 13:28.601
[Ryland]:
The infection rate is 18%.

13:28.601 --> 13:30.033
One in five of them

13:30.033 --> 13:31.167
are already sick?

13:31.167 --> 13:32.501
One in five today.
Tomorrow...

13:32.501 --> 13:33.768
the national
institute of health

13:33.768 --> 13:37.601
is worried that this illness,
whatever it is,

13:37.601 --> 13:38.634
can mutate

13:38.634 --> 13:39.701
and cross over

13:39.701 --> 13:41.033
into the general
population.

13:41.033 --> 13:42.100
Would it even
have to mutate?

13:42.100 --> 13:43.334
There's
no guarantee

13:43.334 --> 13:45.100
that this is going to
stay exclusive to 4400s

13:45.100 --> 13:47.467
and meanwhile,

13:47.467 --> 13:49.401
we've got two dozen sick ones
right downstairs.

13:49.401 --> 13:50.401
They're not going to
be there long.

13:50.401 --> 13:51.401
Why?

13:51.401 --> 13:52.868
What are we doing with them?

13:52.868 --> 13:55.601
D.c. Wants to put all the 4400
back in quarantine

13:55.601 --> 13:57.234
and keep them there

13:57.234 --> 13:59.033
for the rest
of the crisis.

13:59.033 --> 14:02.100
I know it's a big move, people,

14:02.100 --> 14:03.933
but it's the best one we've got
at the moment.

14:03.933 --> 14:05.100
Can we do that?

14:05.100 --> 14:06.967
According to emergency
quarantine order 74,

14:06.967 --> 14:08.067
we can.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.200
But wait,
you're just talking

14:09.200 --> 14:11.033
about the sick ones here,
right?

14:11.033 --> 14:12.434
No. All of them.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.033
Every 4400
in the country

14:15.033 --> 14:16.100
is subject to this order.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.401
Okay,

14:17.401 --> 14:18.334
but that's only half of them.

14:18.334 --> 14:19.634
This thing's worldwide, right?

14:19.634 --> 14:22.067
England and france
are passing similar legislation.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.967
We expect
other countries to follow.

14:24.967 --> 14:27.234
But why are you forcing them all
to come in?

14:27.234 --> 14:30.000
Because the disease seems to be
showing up at random.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.734
Until we understand
how it's transmitted,

14:32.734 --> 14:33.933
we have to assume

14:33.933 --> 14:36.501
that every 4400
is a potential vector.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.534
How much time
are we giving them?

14:37.534 --> 14:38.567
We'll make
the announcement

14:38.567 --> 14:39.501
in the morning.

14:39.501 --> 14:40.434
They'll have 12 hours

14:40.434 --> 14:42.200
to get to a local
ntac branch,

14:42.200 --> 14:43.200
then they'll be
transferred

14:43.200 --> 14:44.167
to camp dekker

14:44.167 --> 14:45.667
and the quarantine facility.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.467
What if they don't report?

14:47.467 --> 14:49.768
Then it'll be our job
to bring them in.

14:58.634 --> 14:59.801
You're not hearing me...

14:59.801 --> 15:01.200
it's temporary.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.334
Can you be sure?

15:02.334 --> 15:03.601
You already told me
people in washington

15:03.601 --> 15:05.033
think we're
fighting a war.

15:05.033 --> 15:07.601
Washington is
full of opinions.

15:07.601 --> 15:08.834
The town runs on them.

15:08.834 --> 15:10.134
The 4400

15:10.134 --> 15:11.467
aren't just names
in some report...

15:11.467 --> 15:13.334
and they're definitely
not enemy combatants.

15:13.334 --> 15:14.834
You're talking
about my daughter,

15:14.834 --> 15:15.900
tom's nephew...

15:15.900 --> 15:17.000
the woman i love.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.634
I was going to tell you
over that beer.

15:21.634 --> 15:22.567
[Diana]: Now,
what assurances

15:22.567 --> 15:23.534
can you give us

15:23.534 --> 15:24.900
that these people

15:24.900 --> 15:26.567
aren't just being
thrown down some hole

15:26.567 --> 15:27.701
permanently?

15:27.701 --> 15:28.701
You have my assurance,

15:28.701 --> 15:30.401
and that should be
enough.

15:30.401 --> 15:31.701
I was the one who pushed
to let them out

15:31.701 --> 15:33.300
in the first place,
you remember?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.134
We're not trying
to second-guess you, dennis,

15:35.134 --> 15:37.401
but people we love are sick.

15:37.401 --> 15:38.601
I get it,

15:38.601 --> 15:40.467
but getting them all
together in one place

15:40.467 --> 15:42.300
is going to make it
a lot easier

15:42.300 --> 15:45.167
to find out
what the hell this is.

15:45.167 --> 15:46.933
When it's over,
everybody goes home.

15:48.900 --> 15:50.834
We know you'll
fight the good fight, dennis.

15:50.834 --> 15:52.200
I just hope you can win.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.501
Mommy?

16:09.501 --> 16:12.000
You're awake.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.200
How are you, baby?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.000
I'm tired of being sick.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.534
When can i go home?

16:19.534 --> 16:21.834
Why don't you tell me?

16:21.834 --> 16:26.501
I was kind of hoping
you'd had a vision,

16:26.501 --> 16:30.200
about how all this
will be over soon.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.701
They're not coming
anymore.

16:34.701 --> 16:37.868
I'm not seeing things.

16:37.868 --> 16:39.634
My favorite patient
is awake.

16:39.634 --> 16:41.834
More awake than you look.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.434
Mm.

16:43.434 --> 16:45.701
Open wide.

16:45.701 --> 16:47.267
I do my best work

16:47.267 --> 16:48.734
when i eliminate sleep
altogether.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.100
Well, if you need someone

16:50.100 --> 16:51.367
to splash cold water
on your face,

16:51.367 --> 16:52.734
you just let me know.

16:52.734 --> 16:55.401
Thanks.

16:58.234 --> 16:59.967
Do you mind?

17:01.734 --> 17:04.032
I noticed that missing page
made its way back in.

17:04.032 --> 17:05.000
Oh. Yeah.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.401
I told you it'd be back.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.933
What are those two lines
blacked out for?

17:08.933 --> 17:11.367
Well, looks like
we duplicated a test.

17:11.367 --> 17:12.601
They cross it out

17:12.601 --> 17:14.434
so we don't read
the same results twice.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.300
Okay, let's see
how that rash is doing.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.134
[Lily]: I'm fine, brian.

17:22.134 --> 17:23.733
Tell heidi not to worry.

17:23.733 --> 17:24.967
Richard's fine.

17:24.967 --> 17:26.534
Isabelle's fine.

17:26.534 --> 17:27.701
Well, the news
is making it sound

17:27.701 --> 17:29.267
like everybody's sick.

17:29.267 --> 17:30.900
People are terrified,

17:30.900 --> 17:32.868
and if normal people
start getting sick...

17:32.868 --> 17:34.234
"normal people"?

17:34.234 --> 17:36.933
Okay, that
came out wrong,

17:36.933 --> 17:38.967
but you know
what i mean.

17:38.967 --> 17:40.967
And listen, lily,

17:40.967 --> 17:43.067
heidi's not the only one
that's worried about you.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.768
I am, too.

17:44.768 --> 17:47.134
A year and a half ago,

17:47.134 --> 17:49.667
you welcomed me home
with a restraining order.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.300
I know.

17:53.300 --> 17:57.167
I panicked when you got back.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.234
Don't think i haven't lost sleep
over what i did.

18:00.467 --> 18:01.701
I just want you
to know now

18:01.701 --> 18:03.300
that i'm there for you.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.601
You, richard, isabelle.

18:05.601 --> 18:07.401
You need anything...

18:07.401 --> 18:08.501
just call.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.434
"Quarantine."

18:13.434 --> 18:15.200
That's an evocative word
these days.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.100
Conjures up images
of secret prisons and...

18:17.100 --> 18:19.634
what's the euphemism
you're using now?

18:19.634 --> 18:20.933
"Coercion tactics"?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.167
[Tom]: Let me
ask you something...

18:22.167 --> 18:23.701
you have some doctors
on staff here, right?

18:23.701 --> 18:24.801
Yes.

18:24.801 --> 18:25.834
They having any luck

18:25.834 --> 18:26.868
getting to the bottom
of this thing?

18:26.868 --> 18:27.967
Not yet.

18:27.967 --> 18:29.167
Then get off
your soapbox.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.334
You want an image
to hold on to?

18:30.334 --> 18:32.567
Try this one...
4400s dying in droves.

18:32.567 --> 18:34.000
I think what my partner
means to say

18:34.000 --> 18:35.367
is that our
two organizations

18:35.367 --> 18:36.567
need each other.

18:36.567 --> 18:37.634
We should cooperate.

18:37.634 --> 18:39.033
And how exactly
do we do that?

18:39.033 --> 18:40.634
We want you to issue
a public statement.

18:40.634 --> 18:42.567
If the center
counsels the 4400s

18:42.567 --> 18:43.834
to go along
with this order,

18:43.834 --> 18:46.501
things will go
much more smoothly.

18:46.501 --> 18:47.667
And if we don't?

18:47.667 --> 18:48.834
Why are we talking
to you, anyway?

18:48.834 --> 18:49.933
Where's shawn?

18:49.933 --> 18:51.834
Is he all right?

18:51.834 --> 18:54.234
Mr. Farrell
is handling urgent business.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.567
This situation requires
his full attention.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.734
Look, i'll have to
run it by him,

18:58.734 --> 19:00.967
but i don't see a problem
advising any ill 4400s

19:00.967 --> 19:03.567
to seek medical care
from ntac.

19:03.567 --> 19:05.634
Well, that's a start.

19:05.634 --> 19:06.801
What about the ones

19:06.801 --> 19:08.534
who aren't
showing symptoms?

19:08.534 --> 19:10.534
That issue's going to require
a little more thought.

19:10.534 --> 19:12.334
Great.
You have 12 hours.

19:20.401 --> 19:21.601
[Teenage boy]:
What's the point

19:21.601 --> 19:22.567
of painting it over,
anyway?

19:22.567 --> 19:23.967
They're just gonna
do it again.

19:23.967 --> 19:25.401
We don't know that.

19:25.401 --> 19:27.200
Look, sam,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.933
kyle has been nice enough
to come over here

19:28.933 --> 19:30.234
and help us out,

19:30.234 --> 19:33.567
so the least that you can do
is pitch in.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.234
Oh, yes, very good...

19:36.234 --> 19:37.434
picasso.

19:37.434 --> 19:39.200
I'm going to make sandwiches.

19:44.834 --> 19:47.267
Okay, seriously,
what's your story?

19:47.267 --> 19:48.300
Why are you helping us,

19:48.300 --> 19:50.601
kyle whoever-you-are?

19:50.601 --> 19:52.834
My last name's bingham...

19:52.834 --> 19:54.868
and i don't know.

19:54.868 --> 19:56.967
I was just walking by here
yesterday.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.967
Alison looked
like she could use a hand...

19:58.967 --> 20:00.267
yeah, well,

20:00.267 --> 20:01.701
if you were thinking
about hooking up with her,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.234
forget it.

20:03.234 --> 20:04.434
Alison's gonna
marry my brother

20:04.434 --> 20:06.334
as soon as he gets out of jail.

20:06.334 --> 20:07.534
I know. I know.
She told me.

20:07.534 --> 20:08.534
You should listen to her.

20:10.067 --> 20:11.467
Roy didn't kill
this collier guy.

20:13.401 --> 20:15.033
I believe you.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.467
Yeah?

20:18.467 --> 20:19.967
Well, you're the only one.

20:19.967 --> 20:21.300
You and me.

20:23.601 --> 20:25.067
When he does get out,

20:25.067 --> 20:26.900
i don't think
you want him coming home

20:26.900 --> 20:28.567
and seeing "murderer"
written all over his door,

20:28.567 --> 20:29.801
do you?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.567
Richard...

20:40.567 --> 20:42.267
you ready for a promotion?

20:42.267 --> 20:44.267
Me?

20:44.267 --> 20:45.634
A promotion to what?

20:45.634 --> 20:47.367
I'm trying here, man.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.801
I want to lead us all
through this,

20:48.801 --> 20:51.167
but i can't do that right now.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.067
Thank you.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.134
I know i'm a 4400,
but after that,

20:59.134 --> 21:01.000
my qualifications
are a little thin.

21:03.401 --> 21:04.967
They didn't even give me
an ability.

21:04.967 --> 21:06.900
To be honest with you,
i'm not sure how long

21:06.900 --> 21:08.501
lily and i were planning
on staying here.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.434
So it's not a perfect fit,

21:12.434 --> 21:14.000
but you're articulate,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.868
and a war hero,

21:15.868 --> 21:16.933
and you have
the gravitas

21:16.933 --> 21:18.067
of a leader.

21:18.067 --> 21:19.434
I think
it's a good idea.

21:19.434 --> 21:22.634
I haven't given an order
since 1951.

21:23.967 --> 21:26.634
I was in high school
a year and a half ago.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.033
I managed.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.134
So will you.

21:32.267 --> 21:33.868
But it's only temporary, right?

21:33.868 --> 21:35.200
As soon as you get better,

21:35.200 --> 21:36.534
i can go right back
to being camera-shy.

21:36.534 --> 21:39.334
Yeah.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.033
Temporary.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.033
What are you going to do?

21:48.401 --> 21:51.667
What i have to.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.134
Desease has everyone frightened,

22:50.134 --> 22:53.000
and that's understandable.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.601
But no one's more frightened
than we are.

22:55.601 --> 22:58.334
And that's because,

22:58.334 --> 23:02.501
in spite of all the rumors
that you hear flying around,

23:02.501 --> 23:05.467
only 4400s
are getting sick,

23:05.467 --> 23:06.801
and now the government

23:06.801 --> 23:09.300
wants us to head
into quarantine.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.534
They say cooperation
is essential.

23:11.534 --> 23:15.167
Well, here's
the best we can do...

23:15.167 --> 23:17.033
<i>if you're sick,</i>

23:17.033 --> 23:20.768
<i>the responsible thing
is to report to ntac.</i>

23:20.768 --> 23:22.033
<i>Our best wishes
and prayers</i>

23:22.033 --> 23:24.601
<i>go with you.</i>

23:24.601 --> 23:26.667
But if you're well,

23:26.667 --> 23:28.434
if you're showing no symptoms,

23:28.434 --> 23:33.067
we ask you to consider this...

23:33.067 --> 23:36.734
walking into quarantine
is an easy step,

23:36.734 --> 23:39.334
but walking out...

23:42.100 --> 23:44.200
that might be
considerably more difficult.

23:46.734 --> 23:48.667
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:48.667 --> 23:50.200
Don't they get it?

23:50.200 --> 23:52.000
We're trying
to help these people.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.267
All they hear is
"quarantine," dennis.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.734
You can't blame them
for being scared.

23:56.734 --> 23:58.134
Maybe if we give them
another day,

23:58.134 --> 24:00.000
half a day, even.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.234
Does it look to you

24:01.234 --> 24:02.367
like they haven't
made up their minds?

24:02.367 --> 24:06.234
We tried
being reasonable.

24:06.234 --> 24:08.634
In 10 hours,
we start rounding them up.

24:15.367 --> 24:17.401
Hi.

24:17.401 --> 24:19.467
Hey.

24:19.467 --> 24:20.933
I know who you are.

24:20.933 --> 24:22.501
You're the one
who fixes people.

24:22.501 --> 24:25.801
Yeah. Shawn.

24:25.801 --> 24:28.334
How come you're in here?

24:28.334 --> 24:30.467
Why don't you just
make yourself better?

24:30.467 --> 24:32.567
I wish i could.

24:32.567 --> 24:34.467
They're broken.

24:34.467 --> 24:37.467
Kind of like
the rest of me.

24:37.467 --> 24:40.300
I used to see things.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.567
Stuff that was
gonna happen.

24:42.567 --> 24:44.834
That's gone now too.

24:46.734 --> 24:48.067
It's funny, huh?

24:48.067 --> 24:50.134
When i found out
i was different,

24:50.134 --> 24:53.134
all i wanted to do
was be normal again.

24:53.134 --> 24:54.534
Me too.

24:54.534 --> 24:55.900
But you
get used to it.

24:55.900 --> 25:00.868
Now that it's gone,
i feel like i'm missing an arm.

25:00.868 --> 25:02.601
It'll come back.

25:02.601 --> 25:04.634
Once we get better.

25:04.634 --> 25:06.801
Any idea when that's gonna be?

25:06.801 --> 25:08.834
Not exactly,

25:08.834 --> 25:11.334
but my mom told me
everything's gonna be fine,

25:11.334 --> 25:14.300
and i believe what she says.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.667
That must be a nice feeling.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.768
Don't you have someone
to believe in?

25:24.200 --> 25:27.667
I used to...

25:27.667 --> 25:29.067
but now i guess

25:29.067 --> 25:31.434
i'm just going to have to
believe in you.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.768
You're the one
i attacked

25:47.768 --> 25:49.234
at the hospital.

25:49.234 --> 25:50.367
We didn't think
you'd remember us.

25:50.367 --> 25:51.334
I remember.

25:51.334 --> 25:53.200
I was...

25:53.200 --> 25:55.467
very sick back then.

25:57.501 --> 25:58.734
I'm better now.

26:00.033 --> 26:01.701
Diana, you wanted
to see me?

26:01.701 --> 26:03.200
Kevin burkhoff.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.367
I've been doing
neurological research

26:05.367 --> 26:06.334
on the 4400.

26:06.334 --> 26:07.967
Oh, i've heard of you.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.267
Everybody here has.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.567
Here.

26:10.567 --> 26:13.134
There's some very
interesting data

26:13.134 --> 26:14.134
on the blood work
i've been doing.

26:14.134 --> 26:15.200
Have a look.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.401
See if it helps you figure out

26:16.401 --> 26:17.501
what's going on
with this disease.

26:17.501 --> 26:18.900
Well, thank you.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.567
I'll comb
through this.

26:20.567 --> 26:21.967
Good,

26:21.967 --> 26:24.933
and i can expect
to see your work... when?

26:27.967 --> 26:29.401
I showed you mine.

26:29.401 --> 26:31.367
You show me yours.

26:31.367 --> 26:33.534
That is the way
it works,

26:33.534 --> 26:35.200
isn't it?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.367
Usually,

26:36.367 --> 26:38.567
but the research we do here
is classified.

26:38.567 --> 26:39.667
[Diana]: Max...

26:39.667 --> 26:41.701
max, if ever
there was a time

26:41.701 --> 26:42.868
to bend the rules
a little,

26:42.868 --> 26:44.000
i think
it might be now.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.334
Well, it's not
a wink-and-a-nudge situation.

26:45.334 --> 26:47.134
I give over
classified documents,

26:47.134 --> 26:48.401
i go to jail.

26:48.401 --> 26:50.334
Yeah, and if you don't,
people might die.

26:50.334 --> 26:52.100
Are you implying we're not doing
everything we can?

26:52.100 --> 26:53.200
We've got dozens
of doctors

26:53.200 --> 26:54.701
working
around the clock

26:54.701 --> 26:56.200
to try to solve this thing.

26:56.200 --> 27:00.834
Now, i will look over
everything that you've given me.

27:00.834 --> 27:03.167
If i find anything
that can help you,

27:03.167 --> 27:04.534
i'll give you a call.

27:04.534 --> 27:05.868
That's the best i can do.

27:09.734 --> 27:11.033
I am so sorry...

27:11.033 --> 27:12.100
i'm not interested
in apologies.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.567
I want to see
that information.

27:14.567 --> 27:17.067
Or is ntac not interested
in curing these people?

27:21.967 --> 27:23.134
I know you guys
are kind of cavalier

27:23.134 --> 27:24.434
about putting your own careers
on the line,

27:24.434 --> 27:26.067
but do me a favor...

27:26.067 --> 27:28.067
stop asking me
to join in the fun, okay?

27:28.067 --> 27:30.267
I like what i do here.

27:30.267 --> 27:31.667
They're medical records, marco.

27:31.667 --> 27:32.933
Not national secrets.

27:32.933 --> 27:34.167
Wrong.

27:34.167 --> 27:35.734
They're medical records
and national secrets.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.267
That is why they keep them
in a database

27:37.267 --> 27:38.868
you need six passwords
to get into,

27:38.868 --> 27:41.234
and that's why sport-o
wouldn't give them to you.

27:41.234 --> 27:43.667
Let's just leave max
out of this.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.033
He's under a lot of pressure.

27:45.033 --> 27:46.401
And he wants
to keep his job.

27:46.401 --> 27:47.667
I don't blame him.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.367
You know, i just
opened a 401(k).

27:49.367 --> 27:50.534
Yeah, pretty sure

27:50.534 --> 27:51.933
the government stops
matching donations

27:51.933 --> 27:53.300
once you commit treason.

27:53.300 --> 27:54.434
The government

27:54.434 --> 27:55.634
just turned down
an offer of help

27:55.634 --> 27:56.801
from kevin burkhoff.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.067
Remember him?

27:58.067 --> 27:59.167
Yeah, the future
built a giant tower

27:59.167 --> 28:00.300
to wake him up.

28:00.300 --> 28:01.834
I guess they think he matters.

28:01.834 --> 28:03.200
If anyone in washington
read my report,

28:03.200 --> 28:05.000
they know
he matters, too.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.967
You know, it's weird.

28:06.967 --> 28:08.300
Hundreds of people are sick.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.334
You'd think they'd want
any help they could get.

28:10.334 --> 28:11.834
Well, they're going to
get his help.

28:11.834 --> 28:14.234
Yeah, whether they want it
or not.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.334
Gotcha.

28:20.401 --> 28:21.701
Yeah.

28:21.701 --> 28:23.667
Is isabelle ready
to go for her walk?

28:23.667 --> 28:26.067
Okay, let's go have some fun.

28:42.434 --> 28:43.501
How long has she
been in there?

28:43.501 --> 28:44.701
I don't know.
Five minutes.

28:44.701 --> 28:47.167
I came and got you
as soon as i saw.

28:49.667 --> 28:51.067
What are they
doing to her in there?

28:51.067 --> 28:52.834
Step back.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.167
[Matthew]: Would you
excuse us, please?

29:04.667 --> 29:06.033
How long has this been going on?

29:06.033 --> 29:07.367
Richard, your daughter

29:07.367 --> 29:08.834
has never been
in any kind of danger.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.033
He asked you a question.

29:10.033 --> 29:11.501
Jordan was going to
initiate these tests

29:11.501 --> 29:13.234
as soon as he convinced you
to come back into the fold...

29:13.234 --> 29:15.467
what tests?
What have you been doing to her?

29:15.467 --> 29:16.967
All we're doing
is what you should have done

29:16.967 --> 29:18.367
a long time ago...

29:18.367 --> 29:20.033
trying to figure out who,
or what, isabelle is.

29:20.033 --> 29:21.100
She's our daughter.

29:21.100 --> 29:23.367
That's all you
or anyone else

29:23.367 --> 29:25.067
your daughter
is the rosetta stone

29:25.067 --> 29:26.434
for understanding
what happened to the 4400,

29:26.434 --> 29:28.367
yet you both cling
to the illusion

29:28.367 --> 29:29.967
that she's going to go
to preschool,

29:29.967 --> 29:31.467
first communion, the prom...

29:31.467 --> 29:32.734
she's not communal property.

29:32.734 --> 29:34.701
We're her parents. We decide.

29:34.701 --> 29:35.601
Parents?

29:35.601 --> 29:38.000
You are the stewards
of the future,

29:38.000 --> 29:40.167
and forgive me for saying so,

29:40.167 --> 29:41.900
but you're doing
a piss-poor job of it.

29:41.900 --> 29:43.033
We have given up
everything we have

29:43.033 --> 29:44.701
for that child,

29:44.701 --> 29:46.834
any chance we had
of living a normal life,

29:46.834 --> 29:48.567
to protect her
from people like you.

29:48.567 --> 29:49.534
Look, richard, this is no time
for this conversation.

29:49.534 --> 29:50.868
In two hours,

29:50.868 --> 29:52.167
the government is
coming through the front door.

29:52.167 --> 29:53.667
Yeah, well,
you won't use my daughter

29:53.667 --> 29:55.234
as some kind of weapon
against them.

29:55.234 --> 29:56.933
That was never my intention.

29:56.933 --> 29:58.267
You'll never have the chance.
We're leaving right now.

29:58.267 --> 30:00.234
That's your choice,
but if you do,

30:00.234 --> 30:01.534
if we splinter now,

30:01.534 --> 30:04.534
they will round up the 4400 one by one,
and this movement is over.

30:24.168 --> 30:25.268
Hey.

30:25.268 --> 30:27.467
Hey, thomas.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.534
Hey.

30:29.534 --> 30:31.300
They said
you've been asking for me.

30:31.300 --> 30:32.600
Shouldn't you be in bed?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.400
They'll take me back
soon enough.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.067
I wanted to see you.

30:38.067 --> 30:41.534
How do you feel, baby?

30:43.400 --> 30:46.433
They can't get the fever down,
but...

30:46.433 --> 30:49.600
the worst part is my head.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.400
Everything's so mixed up.

30:51.400 --> 30:54.268
This illness,

30:54.268 --> 30:56.734
it affects people's abilities.

30:56.734 --> 30:58.934
Maia can't see things, and...

30:58.934 --> 31:01.001
and shawn, shawn can't heal,

31:01.001 --> 31:02.234
and for you, honey,

31:02.234 --> 31:04.201
i think the boundaries

31:04.201 --> 31:06.234
between this world
and the one you created

31:06.234 --> 31:08.467
are breaking down.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.034
It's so confusing.

31:11.034 --> 31:14.467
I don't know
what's real anymore.

31:14.467 --> 31:16.333
I know it's scary.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.433
You just have to hang on.

31:18.433 --> 31:19.867
They'll get this fixed.

31:22.367 --> 31:23.934
What if they're too late?

31:23.934 --> 31:25.333
What if they can
make my body right,

31:25.333 --> 31:26.700
but not my mind?

31:26.700 --> 31:28.300
I don't want to live like that,
thomas.

31:28.300 --> 31:29.600
You're not
going to have to.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.734
You're going to get better.

31:30.734 --> 31:32.700
You have to believe that, alana.

31:37.700 --> 31:38.867
Thomas...

31:38.867 --> 31:41.001
yeah?

31:43.734 --> 31:46.333
I love you so much.

31:46.333 --> 31:50.234
I wanted us to get married
for real,

31:50.234 --> 31:51.901
in this world.

31:57.534 --> 32:00.300
That's all i wanted to tell you,
before...

32:02.134 --> 32:05.600
before my mind goes...

32:05.600 --> 32:07.734
because...

32:07.734 --> 32:09.934
i don't know
if it will be good again.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.201
So you're sure i can't get you
a beer or something?

32:17.201 --> 32:18.234
No, no,
that's okay.

32:18.234 --> 32:19.700
I don't drink.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.333
Okay.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.667
You know, this isn't
really necessary.

32:25.667 --> 32:27.634
I just did
a couple of chores.

32:27.634 --> 32:29.667
Maybe it's not a big deal
to you,

32:29.667 --> 32:32.400
but i just haven't seen
a friendly face

32:32.400 --> 32:33.734
in a while,

32:33.734 --> 32:36.700
not since... roy went away.

32:38.001 --> 32:42.834
no offense, but, um...

32:42.834 --> 32:44.834
the papers make him sound

32:44.834 --> 32:46.967
like the second coming
of lee harvey oswald.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.734
Yeah.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.700
Well, i wouldn't exactly call it
"fair and balanced coverage."

32:51.700 --> 32:53.801
But he did have
some monstrous gun collection,

32:53.801 --> 32:54.801
right?

32:56.367 --> 32:57.767
Look, i'm not saying

32:57.767 --> 32:59.367
that he was a candidate
for higher office,

32:59.367 --> 33:01.234
and...

33:01.234 --> 33:02.467
he sure as hell

33:02.467 --> 33:03.667
wasn't the world's
greatest boyfriend.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.201
But taking out
two ntac agents

33:05.201 --> 33:06.300
and shooting jordan collier?

33:06.300 --> 33:07.534
Come on.

33:07.534 --> 33:09.101
Yeah.

33:09.101 --> 33:10.734
Yeah.

33:10.734 --> 33:13.234
Eat up.

33:13.234 --> 33:15.667
Sam!

33:15.667 --> 33:17.667
Sam, come on!
We're starting.

33:17.667 --> 33:20.201
I'll be right there.

33:36.034 --> 33:39.467
Hey.

33:39.467 --> 33:40.901
Okay.

33:47.134 --> 33:48.201
Are you marco?

33:48.201 --> 33:49.500
Thanks.

33:49.500 --> 33:51.101
Don't thank me.
Hire me.

33:53.134 --> 33:54.801
I'm gonna need a job.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.567
Where have you been?

33:58.567 --> 34:00.101
Talking to matthew.

34:00.101 --> 34:01.333
Lily...

34:01.333 --> 34:02.534
he's got an idea

34:02.534 --> 34:03.534
on how to handle
this roundup.

34:03.534 --> 34:04.767
I think it might work.

34:04.767 --> 34:06.734
I'm sure
he's full of clever ideas.

34:06.734 --> 34:08.333
We will deal with
what matthew did,

34:08.333 --> 34:09.967
but not now.

34:09.967 --> 34:12.268
The government is about
to declare martial law

34:12.268 --> 34:13.433
we don't have time to squabble.

34:13.433 --> 34:14.867
All i want to hear

34:14.867 --> 34:16.667
is that you're done
with this place for good.

34:16.667 --> 34:17.934
It's not that simple.

34:17.934 --> 34:19.433
We can't just go off
and hide in the woods somewhere.

34:19.433 --> 34:20.766
It's not going to work
this time.

34:20.766 --> 34:23.667
The center betrayed us.
They betrayed our daughter.

34:23.667 --> 34:24.867
And they learned
about her,

34:24.867 --> 34:26.067
more than we did
in almost a year.

34:26.067 --> 34:27.101
Lily, stop.

34:28.801 --> 34:30.433
Did you know

34:30.433 --> 34:31.934
isabelle has connections

34:31.934 --> 34:33.168
between the right and left
hemispheres of her brain

34:33.168 --> 34:35.067
that have never been
seen before?

34:36.934 --> 34:38.833
Even if that's true, richard...

34:38.833 --> 34:41.134
it's not that they studied her.

34:41.134 --> 34:42.833
It's how they did it.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.201
Do you trust
the government?

34:44.201 --> 34:45.900
Because
if we go into quarantine,

34:45.900 --> 34:47.467
isabelle will end up
right here,

34:47.467 --> 34:48.900
or with them,

34:48.900 --> 34:51.534
and if they find out
what she can do...

34:51.534 --> 34:54.234
we'll lose her forever.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.400
[Ryland]: That's it.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.667
That's the deadline.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.101
Where do we start?

35:52.567 --> 35:54.867
I want everybody
to holster their pistols.

35:54.867 --> 35:57.034
My goal is to do this quietly,
peacefully,

35:57.034 --> 35:58.801
and without incident.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.634
What if they want
an incident?

36:02.634 --> 36:04.867
Then we'll give them one.

36:04.867 --> 36:06.867
Is everybody ready?

36:06.867 --> 36:08.300
<i>Affirmative, sir.</i>

36:08.300 --> 36:09.801
<i>We're in position.</i>

36:09.801 --> 36:12.367
Let's go.

36:12.367 --> 36:13.967
Moving in now.

36:13.967 --> 36:15.168
<i>Copy that.
They're on the move.</i>

36:22.667 --> 36:24.034
They're
spreading out

36:24.034 --> 36:26.500
and letting us
through.

36:44.268 --> 36:46.333
Welcome to the center.

36:46.333 --> 36:47.734
Did you come for the tour?

36:47.734 --> 36:50.400
You know damn well
why we're here.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.300
Out hunting, i'd guess.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.834
Well, i'm afraid
you've come to the wrong place.

36:54.834 --> 36:57.001
You are welcome to look around,

36:57.534 --> 37:00.001
but there are no 4400 here.

37:07.367 --> 37:08.700
I have no idea

37:08.700 --> 37:09.967
where they went.

37:12.468 --> 37:16.067
You had 120 4400s
taking shelter at your center.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.767
That sounds about right.

37:17.767 --> 37:19.101
I don't have an exact figure.

37:19.101 --> 37:20.401
You just came
downstairs,

37:20.401 --> 37:21.434
and they were gone?

37:21.434 --> 37:22.434
Until 7:00 this evening,

37:22.434 --> 37:23.501
they were free citizens.

37:23.501 --> 37:24.600
I had no reason

37:24.600 --> 37:25.633
to track
their movements,

37:25.633 --> 37:27.967
and since i've broken no laws,

37:27.967 --> 37:30.201
unless you want to talk about
lifting this quarantine order,

37:30.201 --> 37:32.534
we have nothing left to discuss.

37:34.234 --> 37:35.434
We'll talk again.

37:37.834 --> 37:39.434
I suspect your job
is going to get rather ugly

37:39.434 --> 37:40.501
from here on out,

37:40.501 --> 37:43.401
kicking in doors
and such.

37:43.401 --> 37:44.900
If i worked at ntac,

37:44.900 --> 37:47.733
i might spend a little less time
trying to find missing 4400s,

37:47.733 --> 37:50.568
and a little more
trying to cure the ones i had.

37:52.600 --> 37:56.201
So tell me,
have we got a list

37:56.201 --> 37:57.301
yeah.

37:57.301 --> 37:58.633
All the sick ones we know of
are in.

37:58.633 --> 38:00.733
As for the rest,
we had about 75% compliance.

38:00.733 --> 38:02.067
Nationwide,

38:02.067 --> 38:05.034
there's about 5204400s
unaccounted for.

38:05.034 --> 38:06.434
Well, that's not a few holdouts.

38:06.434 --> 38:07.600
That's an insurgency.

38:09.534 --> 38:10.800
So this is it, huh?

38:10.800 --> 38:11.867
Us against them.

38:11.867 --> 38:15.201
You know, it feels
kind of like the war

38:15.201 --> 38:16.700
jordan collier always predicted.

38:16.700 --> 38:18.800
Predicted or provoked?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.167
We declared martial law on them.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.134
We had no option.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.234
I'm going to pursue

38:23.234 --> 38:24.667
a policy of non-aggression

38:24.667 --> 38:26.167
as long as i can,

38:26.167 --> 38:28.167
but if it comes down
to a choice

38:28.167 --> 38:31.067
between the safety
of the american people

38:31.067 --> 38:32.733
and the welfare
of the 4400,

38:32.733 --> 38:33.600
tom...

38:35.034 --> 38:36.434
that's no choice at all.

38:39.301 --> 38:41.034
[Richard]: Collier left behind
37 safe houses

38:41.034 --> 38:42.468
throughout the country.

38:42.468 --> 38:45.934
We liquidated the center's
emergency slush fund

38:45.934 --> 38:48.367
should last for awhile.

38:48.367 --> 38:49.534
Any 4400

38:49.534 --> 38:50.867
who contacts the center
for help

38:50.867 --> 38:52.401
will be given
an email address.

38:52.401 --> 38:54.000
If we're satisfied
they're legitimate,

38:54.000 --> 38:55.468
they'll be told
where to go.

38:55.468 --> 38:57.767
Our goal is to get
every 4400 who wants shelter

38:57.767 --> 38:59.434
to safety.

38:59.434 --> 39:01.000
And then what?

39:02.434 --> 39:03.867
Matthew will try

39:03.867 --> 39:05.334
to continue
to end this peacefully,

39:05.334 --> 39:07.034
but if we have to
protect our own...

39:08.900 --> 39:11.234
we'll be ready.

39:13.667 --> 39:15.501
Excuse me.

39:15.501 --> 39:17.167
Excuse me.
Sorry.

39:18.167 --> 39:19.501
Lily...

39:21.900 --> 39:23.534
you make a good speech,

39:23.534 --> 39:25.134
but this isn't korea,

39:25.134 --> 39:27.434
and those
aren't soldiers,

39:27.434 --> 39:28.733
and your daughter

39:28.733 --> 39:30.201
could get caught
in the crossfire.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.600
You don't think
i'm worried about her?

39:31.600 --> 39:34.733
And you too?

39:34.733 --> 39:37.000
Lily, i'm not looking
for a fight,

39:37.000 --> 39:39.067
but right now,
we don't have another option.

39:50.767 --> 39:52.468
Hey. Sam said he liked comics...

39:52.468 --> 39:53.534
you son of a bitch!

39:53.534 --> 39:55.301
You lied to me.

39:55.301 --> 39:56.633
What?

39:56.633 --> 39:57.900
Wait a minute.
It wasn't like that.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.034
Oh, really,
"kyle bingham"?

39:59.034 --> 40:01.034
Your last name
is baldwin,

40:01.034 --> 40:02.934
and your dad works
for ntac.

40:02.934 --> 40:04.301
So, what are you?
His little spy? Huh?

40:04.301 --> 40:05.867
Did you think you were going to
sleep with me?

40:05.867 --> 40:07.667
I was going to tell you
all about roy?

40:07.667 --> 40:09.600
You go and you tell your daddy
that he didn't kill anybody.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.034
I know that.

40:12.733 --> 40:13.967
I was just trying to help you.

40:13.967 --> 40:15.967
Why?

40:18.201 --> 40:19.733
You come off like you're
this really great guy,

40:19.733 --> 40:21.267
and all you were trying to do
was use me.

40:21.267 --> 40:22.434
You're a lying prick.

40:33.234 --> 40:34.934
Okay.

40:34.934 --> 40:36.967
Okay.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.434
This thing that's
killing them,

40:38.434 --> 40:41.101
it's not a disease.

40:41.101 --> 40:42.767
It's a side-effect.

40:42.767 --> 40:44.000
Dr. Burkhoff,
just calm down.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.167
What are you
talking about?

40:45.167 --> 40:46.301
A side-effect of what?

40:46.301 --> 40:47.501
I don't know exactly,

40:47.501 --> 40:49.301
but i do know this...

40:49.301 --> 40:50.867
there's a synthetic substance

40:50.867 --> 40:53.900
present in the blood
of every 4400,

40:53.900 --> 40:55.101
all the ones i tested,

40:55.101 --> 40:56.934
every medical report
you gave me,

40:56.934 --> 40:58.834
sick ones, well ones,

40:58.834 --> 41:01.167
doesn't matter.
They all have it.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.434
They even gave it a name.

41:02.434 --> 41:05.101
They call it
"promicin inhibitor."

41:05.101 --> 41:06.501
Promicin?
What's promicin?

41:06.501 --> 41:07.934
I have no idea,

41:07.934 --> 41:09.034
and i don't know why anyone

41:09.034 --> 41:10.201
would want to inhibit it,
either.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.568
But whatever it is,

41:11.568 --> 41:13.834
it's gathering
in their lymph nodes,

41:13.834 --> 41:15.034
compromising
their immune systems...

41:15.034 --> 41:16.600
it's what's making them sick.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.767
But ntac's been
studying the 4400

41:17.767 --> 41:19.367
ever since
they got back.

41:19.367 --> 41:20.700
They should have
known about this.
They do know.

41:20.700 --> 41:22.468
It's all in here. They know.

41:22.468 --> 41:23.967
So why haven't they
told anyone?

41:23.967 --> 41:25.900
That's a very good question.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.401
When you find out,

41:27.401 --> 41:28.767
why don't you tell me?

41:40.800 --> 41:43.267
[Car idling]

41:48.000 --> 41:49.334
Are you sure
you want to do this?

41:49.334 --> 41:51.900
Just get me and isabelle
someplace safe.

41:55.267 --> 41:56.800
"P.i. Dosage"...

41:56.800 --> 41:59.534
it's on memos,
in every 4400 medical report.

41:59.534 --> 42:01.134
It's on the fifth page
of every report.

42:01.134 --> 42:03.234
That's what hudson
had crossed out

42:03.234 --> 42:04.633
when i went to see maia.

42:06.201 --> 42:07.434
"P.i."

42:07.434 --> 42:08.967
"Promicin inhibitor."

42:08.967 --> 42:11.534
Alana was getting it too,
and shawn.

42:11.534 --> 42:13.101
Everyone was getting it.

42:13.101 --> 42:15.401
Every time
they came to ntac medical.

42:15.401 --> 42:17.401
Every checkup.
