01:11.569 --> 01:12.922
Chiquita!

01:21.969 --> 01:22.958
Jorge!

01:26.529 --> 01:27.518
Jorgito!

02:10.408 --> 02:11.888
El Chupacabra!

02:25.209 --> 02:26.801
El Chupacabra!

03:56.769 --> 03:58.919
All right, you got mail.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.879
"I would love for you and your friends...

04:08.969 --> 04:12.882
"to enjoy a relaxing stay
with my family here in Veracruz.

04:13.049 --> 04:16.279
"It'll be great
to finally meet my American pen pal."

04:16.369 --> 04:19.519
Sounds great!
And I can practice my Spanish.

04:27.969 --> 04:30.005
Jeepers! You have mail.

04:33.449 --> 04:35.883
I thought I'd catch you at your computer.

04:37.049 --> 04:38.846
So, what do you think?

04:39.449 --> 04:42.725
Of course. I'd love to go to Mexico. Yes!

04:43.529 --> 04:45.008
I mean, si!

04:45.729 --> 04:47.367
Let's ask Velma.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.320
Jinkies! You have mail.

04:54.449 --> 04:55.643
Mexico?

04:56.129 --> 04:59.087
The art, the museums, the pyramids...

04:59.569 --> 05:00.888
I'm there!

05:01.209 --> 05:03.279
Great! Let's check with the guys.

05:15.569 --> 05:17.878
Zoinks! Like, you have mail.

05:31.729 --> 05:33.685
Mexico? Tomorrow?

05:34.249 --> 05:35.967
Like, let me check.

05:36.049 --> 05:39.678
What have we got tomorrow, Scoob?
Let's see. Daydreaming at 10:00...

05:39.809 --> 05:42.403
napping, snoozing, relaxing...

05:42.769 --> 05:45.841
Like, sorry, guys, looks like I'm booked.

05:45.969 --> 05:47.561
Reah, rooked!

05:49.489 --> 05:53.721
Do you realize we'll be there for
the annual Day of the Dead celebration?

05:56.209 --> 05:57.528
Like, what's that?

05:57.609 --> 06:00.681
A holiday in which families gather
at the cemetery...

06:00.769 --> 06:02.839
and celebrate their ancestors...

06:02.929 --> 06:06.046
who are allowed to come back to Earth
for two days.

06:08.089 --> 06:11.047
Cemetery? Sounds scary!

06:16.809 --> 06:17.878
Not at all.

06:17.969 --> 06:22.645
Just a bunch of kids in costumes,
lots of skeleton-shaped cookies and candy.

06:23.209 --> 06:25.598
Basically, it's non-stop eating.

06:27.129 --> 06:30.246
- Sounds like Halloween!
- Exactly!

06:30.729 --> 06:33.607
- So, what do you say?
- Can't talk now, guys.

06:33.689 --> 06:35.486
Like, Scoob and I gotta pack!

06:54.569 --> 06:56.719
Looks like that's everything.

06:58.609 --> 07:00.361
Like, what'd I forget?

10:14.049 --> 10:16.279
Are you sure this is the place?

10:17.929 --> 10:19.442
Yeah, this is it.

10:19.929 --> 10:22.807
- Like, looks kind of...
- Quaint?

10:23.649 --> 10:24.798
Small.

10:27.889 --> 10:29.208
Hola, mis amigos!

10:29.289 --> 10:31.962
- Welcome to Mexico!
- Hi, how are you?

10:32.049 --> 10:33.323
Nice to meet you.

10:34.609 --> 10:37.123
- You must be Fred.
- That's right.

10:37.209 --> 10:39.040
And you must be Alejo.

10:39.129 --> 10:41.085
Let me introduce you to the gang. This is...

10:41.169 --> 10:42.318
No need.

10:42.409 --> 10:45.879
They're exactly as you described.
Daphne, Velma...

10:45.969 --> 10:47.118
Senor Scooby.

10:47.329 --> 10:48.842
Is this Shaggy?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.766
He doesn't look like he could eat you
out of house and home.

10:52.849 --> 10:54.919
He's got a high metabolism.

10:57.169 --> 10:59.922
Please, let me introduce you to my family.

11:07.649 --> 11:09.401
Isn't this where you live?

11:10.049 --> 11:12.279
No, these are just the guest cottages.

11:12.369 --> 11:16.123
You will each have your own.
This is where we live.

11:17.409 --> 11:19.525
Welcome to my family's hotel...

11:20.929 --> 11:22.442
La Villa Bella.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.128
It's beautiful!

11:24.569 --> 11:26.525
What does "bella" mean?

11:26.889 --> 11:28.208
Beautiful.

11:30.369 --> 11:33.566
La Villa Bella is very, very bella!

11:33.649 --> 11:35.560
Reah, rery rella!

11:37.369 --> 11:39.121
Let me show you around.

11:40.729 --> 11:44.085
This is my wife, Sofia,
and my mother, Dona Dolores.

11:44.449 --> 11:45.882
Bienvenidos!

11:46.129 --> 11:47.357
Welcome!

11:47.609 --> 11:50.248
And in the pool is the rest of my family.

11:50.849 --> 11:54.285
Jorge, Oliver, Natalia, Cristina,
Fernanda, Carolina, Mirelia, Gabriella...

11:54.369 --> 11:55.848
and Sebastian.

11:55.969 --> 11:57.880
And this is Chiquita!

12:04.369 --> 12:06.087
Are they all your children?

12:09.089 --> 12:10.966
No! Only Jorgito.

12:11.609 --> 12:14.601
The rest are just visiting
for the Day of the Dead festivities.

12:14.689 --> 12:17.442
Here in Mexico, family is muy importante.

12:18.649 --> 12:21.721
You must be hot and tired
after your long trip.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.687
Please feel free
to join the children in the pool.

12:47.609 --> 12:50.601
I think Scooby
has already won someone's heart.

12:58.329 --> 13:02.322
My older brother, Luis, manages the cafe
with his fiancee, Charlene.

13:02.729 --> 13:03.878
Howdy!

13:03.969 --> 13:08.042
Lemme grab y'all a cup of caffay
lay-chair-a whilst you take a load off.

13:13.889 --> 13:15.845
You can see why I fell...

13:15.929 --> 13:19.478
how do you Americans say,
"head over heels" for Charlene.

13:21.249 --> 13:23.683
I met her on my last trip
to the United States...

13:23.769 --> 13:26.203
at Mister Smiley's Fantastic Funland...

13:26.289 --> 13:29.326
and I've been smiling ever since.

13:31.489 --> 13:34.049
You know, cafe lechera
is famous in Veracruz.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.319
First, one server pours you thick coffee...

13:37.409 --> 13:40.162
then the custom is to bang on your glass
with your spoon...

13:40.249 --> 13:43.764
until another server arrives
to pour hot milk in your glass.

13:44.129 --> 13:45.960
Ain't that a hoot?

13:46.529 --> 13:48.759
I just love these loco customs.

13:49.449 --> 13:52.725
"Loco," that's "crazy" in Mexican.
I mean, Spanish.

14:04.889 --> 14:07.357
You know, some days
I grind so many coffee beans...

14:07.449 --> 14:10.202
I swear the little suckers
are coming outta my ears!

14:17.809 --> 14:21.484
It didn't take long for Scooby
to start living la vida mocha!

14:25.529 --> 14:28.202
This lunch is really wonderful,
Dona Dolores.

14:28.769 --> 14:33.206
Whoever came up with the whole
fiesta tradition is okay in my book.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.759
It is often followed by another tradition...

14:38.849 --> 14:40.680
la siesta, an afternoon nap.

14:41.969 --> 14:43.084
Even better!

14:43.489 --> 14:45.161
Reah! Reven retter!

14:46.769 --> 14:51.445
The purpose of fiestas and siestas
is to provide sustenance and rest...

14:51.569 --> 14:53.844
for another tradition: Hard work.

14:54.449 --> 14:56.644
Traditions, like, who needs 'em?

15:04.369 --> 15:07.088
Forgive me for interrupting your meal,
Dona Dolores...

15:07.169 --> 15:10.764
but I need to discuss
some urgent business with your sons.

15:12.689 --> 15:14.122
As you wish.

15:14.769 --> 15:17.158
Excuse us, please. This won't take long.

15:21.809 --> 15:24.846
Diego Fuente used to do business
with my late husband.

15:25.369 --> 15:27.644
I don't trust him, never did.

15:27.729 --> 15:31.005
He is a... How do you say in America?

15:32.049 --> 15:33.164
Crook?

15:33.249 --> 15:35.558
- Liar?
- Con man?

15:37.089 --> 15:38.078
Jerk!

15:38.849 --> 15:41.158
For the last time, I told you, no.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.117
Now, please leave. We have guests.

15:44.609 --> 15:47.043
I apologize for the disturbance.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.127
Please, finish your meal.

15:52.569 --> 15:54.924
That man is as stubborn as a bull.

15:55.529 --> 15:59.647
He wants to buy our father's land
and he won't take no for an answer.

15:59.729 --> 16:02.038
Maybe it is not such a bad idea, Alejo.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.007
Putting all your assets into land is foolish.

16:05.209 --> 16:07.404
We made a promise to Papa
before he died...

16:07.489 --> 16:09.764
and I don't intend to break it now.

16:10.529 --> 16:14.124
So, how will you be spending
your first day in Veracruz?

16:14.489 --> 16:19.005
We were hoping to watch the preparations
for the Day of the Dead festivities.

16:19.249 --> 16:22.047
If anyone's still alive to honor the dead.

16:24.209 --> 16:27.121
Don't y'all know
about the big ol' monster?

16:35.769 --> 16:39.762
You must have noticed by now
that our hotel is relatively empty.

16:39.849 --> 16:42.488
That's because a monster
has been terrorizing Veracruz...

16:42.569 --> 16:43.922
and the nearby villages.

16:44.049 --> 16:46.085
Right after I sent the e-mail to you...

16:46.169 --> 16:49.639
the monster showed up near the plaza
and nearly got Jorgito.

16:50.849 --> 16:55.286
I immediately e-mailed you again
to warn you, but you must've already left.

16:55.929 --> 16:57.999
Did you say monster?

16:58.449 --> 17:01.361
Yes, the locals call him "El Chupacabra."

17:02.169 --> 17:05.684
I've read about him.
He's Mexico's version of the Bigfoot.

17:06.209 --> 17:07.436
Rigfoot?

17:07.729 --> 17:09.002
That's right.

17:09.089 --> 17:13.526
I am not a superstitious man, but I saw it
with my own eyes down by the wharf.

17:13.689 --> 17:15.281
I will never forget it.

17:15.929 --> 17:19.922
He stands nearly 10 feet tall
and walks on two hind legs.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.799
He's covered with thick fur...

17:23.009 --> 17:25.364
has the face of a hideous monkey...

17:25.449 --> 17:27.723
with huge paws and sharp fangs.

17:27.929 --> 17:30.841
And his eyes glow green
like those of a demon.

17:39.209 --> 17:41.006
Calm down, everybody!

17:41.089 --> 17:43.239
The Chupacabra's only a myth!

17:44.049 --> 17:46.768
Yes, let's forget about El Chupacabra...

17:46.849 --> 17:49.443
and make the most of your first visit
to Mexico.

17:49.729 --> 17:52.402
Why don't we all get a good night's sleep?

17:52.729 --> 17:55.243
Yes, there's nothing to worry about.

17:55.569 --> 17:56.763
Alejo's right.

17:57.049 --> 18:00.041
But just in case, double lock your doors.

18:00.569 --> 18:02.480
Say your prayers.

18:02.689 --> 18:07.285
And whatever you do, don't go outside!

18:09.529 --> 18:12.441
Like, whoever heard
such a ridiculous story?

18:12.809 --> 18:16.279
A 10-foot hairy monster
with big feet and sharp teeth?

18:16.569 --> 18:19.129
Sounds like something out of a cartoon!

18:19.249 --> 18:21.285
Like, pleasant dreams, Scoob.

18:22.849 --> 18:24.407
See you in the morning.

18:27.329 --> 18:29.684
Like, it's gonna be a long night.

18:30.169 --> 18:31.158
Yeah.

18:35.249 --> 18:38.480
Did you hear that? Sounds like
something outside the window.

18:40.209 --> 18:42.598
Probably just a little bird or a squirrel.

18:46.929 --> 18:49.727
El caba-choo-choo!
I mean, la kooka-babka!

18:49.809 --> 18:53.643
El popa-choopa! No, I mean, help!

18:56.289 --> 18:58.849
No, Scoob! He's trying to break in!

18:58.969 --> 19:02.200
Like, we're trapped! Let's get out of here!

19:26.609 --> 19:29.885
- What happened to you two?
- And what was all that noise?

19:33.649 --> 19:36.686
Like, that big Mexican Bigfoot
was trying to get us!

19:37.249 --> 19:39.638
Oh, no! Where's Daphne?

19:49.729 --> 19:51.162
Oh, no, you don't.

19:51.489 --> 19:53.559
This is no time to be chicken.

19:53.729 --> 19:56.118
It's all for one and one for all.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.566
Like, I've always felt
teamwork was highly overrated.

20:01.649 --> 20:04.925
Okay, guys, on the count of three,
we'll charge the door.

20:05.529 --> 20:08.441
Ready? One, two...

20:08.689 --> 20:09.565
three!

20:09.689 --> 20:11.327
Charge!

20:16.129 --> 20:18.927
We thought these were the eyes
of the El Chupacabra.

20:19.489 --> 20:20.683
Sorry, guys.

20:20.929 --> 20:25.241
I was afraid to go to sleep and thought
some Latin rhythms would calm me down.

20:25.569 --> 20:28.447
Looks like Alejo's stories riled everyone.

20:30.289 --> 20:32.166
Like, anybody got a bandage?

20:36.649 --> 20:40.164
I don't know what you heard, guys,
but I think we're safe now.

20:40.289 --> 20:44.168
Let's all try and get some...
Wait a minute! What's this?

20:47.049 --> 20:49.768
Footprints! Big ones.

20:51.009 --> 20:54.160
Don't look, or we'll never get to sleep.

20:55.209 --> 20:58.087
Notice how they lead
to the cottage window...

20:58.569 --> 21:02.005
then reverse direction
and head off towards the hotel?

21:03.249 --> 21:05.888
We must've scared whatever it was away.

21:06.169 --> 21:08.205
It was brave enough
when we were separated...

21:08.289 --> 21:11.599
but got scared at the thought
of a bunch of us to contend with.

21:11.689 --> 21:13.919
Not a very courageous monster.

21:14.169 --> 21:16.558
Whatever it is, it's gone.

21:17.449 --> 21:19.599
Maybe now we can all get some sleep.

21:20.609 --> 21:23.521
We're gonna need it.
We've got a big day tomorrow.

21:23.809 --> 21:27.438
Yeah, sightseeing
and chocolate bean tamales!

21:28.009 --> 21:29.124
Can't wait!

21:33.449 --> 21:36.009
That's not exactly what I meant, Shaggy.

21:39.369 --> 21:41.564
We've got a mystery on our hands.

21:42.209 --> 21:43.198
Zoinks!

21:44.649 --> 21:47.368
...and whatever it was, we scared it away.

21:47.969 --> 21:50.529
I got up early, and using my mud mask...

21:50.729 --> 21:54.165
made a cast of the footprint
from Bigfoot's big foot.

21:55.369 --> 21:56.324
Look!

21:57.609 --> 21:59.122
It's huge!

21:59.209 --> 22:02.997
And look, it is speckled
with some kind of gritty black stuff.

22:03.769 --> 22:05.043
Is it dirt?

22:05.929 --> 22:07.203
I don't think so.

22:07.809 --> 22:09.561
I don't know what it is.

22:09.849 --> 22:13.922
Whatever it is, please do not mention it
to my mother or Sofia.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.922
Or Charlene. I don't want to scare them.

22:17.129 --> 22:21.042
In fact, I better alert the security guards
to be especially vigilant.

22:21.809 --> 22:22.958
If word of this gets out...

22:23.049 --> 22:25.802
we will lose the few tourists
we have managed to keep.

22:25.889 --> 22:28.244
El Chupacabra could ruin our livelihood...

22:28.329 --> 22:30.763
not to mention everyone else's
in Veracruz.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.244
Don't worry. No matter how huge...

22:33.329 --> 22:37.288
ferocious or bloodthirsty this vicious
Chupacabra monster may be...

22:37.369 --> 22:39.644
We'll get to the bottom of the mystery.

22:39.929 --> 22:42.238
You can count on us, right, gang?

23:25.969 --> 23:27.880
Muchas gracias...

23:27.969 --> 23:29.687
para su hospital...

23:30.569 --> 23:32.639
y muy deliciosas...

23:34.169 --> 23:35.238
cometas:

23:41.489 --> 23:42.763
What's so funny?

23:42.849 --> 23:46.125
You just thanked my family
for their generous hospital...

23:46.209 --> 23:47.927
and delicious comets.

23:50.169 --> 23:51.887
I almost forgot.

23:53.169 --> 23:55.967
I know this is silly, hon.
But it's a good luck charm.

23:56.049 --> 24:00.042
With that big ol' Bigfoot thang out there,
y'all can't be too careful.

24:01.929 --> 24:04.523
Promise me you won't never take it off.

24:06.489 --> 24:08.525
Si, I promise, Charlene.

24:24.889 --> 24:27.483
As you can see,
there aren't many tourists here...

24:27.569 --> 24:29.764
since the Chupacabra incident.

24:30.209 --> 24:32.928
This place is usually very busy
this time of year.

24:33.449 --> 24:37.158
I've got an idea. Why don't we ask
the locals about the monster.

24:37.729 --> 24:40.289
Good idea, Fred. We can videotape them.

24:41.089 --> 24:43.444
Great! I'll be the reporter.

24:44.849 --> 24:46.760
And action!

24:47.529 --> 24:48.848
A seesaw...

24:49.529 --> 24:51.008
a jungle gym...

24:51.409 --> 24:52.888
a merry-go-round.

24:54.169 --> 24:57.639
At first glance, this modest playground
looks like any other.

24:57.729 --> 25:00.084
But the children here in Veracruz
are fearful...

25:00.169 --> 25:01.841
and have good reason to be.

25:02.489 --> 25:06.402
El Chupacabra. Imaginary Bigfoot?

25:06.849 --> 25:09.886
Or big scary monster
that could bite your head off?

25:10.369 --> 25:11.643
You decide.

25:12.289 --> 25:14.678
What does El Chupacabra look like?

25:14.769 --> 25:15.884
A gorilla!

25:16.489 --> 25:17.558
A bear!

25:17.929 --> 25:18.998
An alien!

25:19.289 --> 25:21.280
What does El Chupacabra do?

25:21.769 --> 25:23.122
Eats goats!

25:23.769 --> 25:25.168
Destroys crops!

25:25.489 --> 25:26.922
He's a bully!

25:29.449 --> 25:31.599
What does El Chupacabra sound like?

25:32.049 --> 25:33.243
Like a coyote!

25:33.689 --> 25:35.042
Like a ape!

25:35.249 --> 25:36.728
Like my Uncle Flaco!

25:37.049 --> 25:38.960
What does he smell like?

25:39.049 --> 25:40.323
Like sulphur!

25:40.729 --> 25:42.048
Like garbage!

25:42.689 --> 25:44.520
Like my Uncle Flaco!

25:45.449 --> 25:48.725
Will he show up tomorrow
at the Day of the Dead festivities...

25:48.969 --> 25:52.564
or will he remain as elusive
as the Loch Ness monster?

25:52.649 --> 25:54.367
Or the perfect boyfriend?

25:55.089 --> 25:57.683
This is Daphne Blake
in Veracruz reporting.

25:58.169 --> 25:59.602
Back to you, Velma.

26:00.009 --> 26:01.522
And cut!

26:02.689 --> 26:04.042
"Back to you"?

26:17.089 --> 26:19.557
Yikes! What does that mean in English?

26:21.449 --> 26:24.441
Leave today or you won't see tomorrow!

26:25.049 --> 26:26.323
Is that right, Alejo?

26:26.529 --> 26:29.487
Unfortunately, your translation is correct.

26:29.729 --> 26:33.358
Looks like someone wants us
to make like a pinata and beat it.

26:37.169 --> 26:39.000
We better get out of here now.

26:41.489 --> 26:42.808
Hold on, you two.

26:43.249 --> 26:46.719
We came here today to get to the bottom
of this Chupacabra mystery.

26:46.929 --> 26:49.523
And no one's going to scare us away
until we do.

26:50.289 --> 26:52.439
Like, Freddy, it's too late for that.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.168
Looks like they need
some friendly persuasion.

26:55.649 --> 26:58.163
Would you each do it for a Scooby snack?

27:03.929 --> 27:06.397
How about two Scooby snacks?

27:14.889 --> 27:18.928
Great! So far, it appears as if
the Chupacabra is nocturnal.

27:19.329 --> 27:23.004
Now that it's getting dark, we should do
a thorough search of the town.

27:23.089 --> 27:25.808
Maybe we'll get a clue to help us
find the monster...

27:25.889 --> 27:27.845
or at least the van vandals.

27:28.449 --> 27:29.564
The girls are right.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.607
Alejo and Luis,
why don't you investigate the hills?

27:32.689 --> 27:35.157
The girls and I will search
the west part of town...

27:35.249 --> 27:37.763
and Scooby and Shaggy
can search the east.

27:40.169 --> 27:44.321
The mystery machine
is actually on the east side of town.

27:44.689 --> 27:46.919
Why don't we do
a thorough search of the van...

27:47.009 --> 27:48.761
and if everything checks out okay...

27:48.849 --> 27:50.407
keep guard right here?

27:51.289 --> 27:52.404
Ro-kay!

28:16.849 --> 28:18.248
Escucha! Listen!

28:20.609 --> 28:23.362
Just an owl. Don't be a baby.

28:38.249 --> 28:39.807
It's just a statue.

28:40.529 --> 28:43.646
Yes, of Quetzalcoatl,
the feathered serpent.

28:44.009 --> 28:45.488
I've read about him.

28:45.569 --> 28:49.403
He was revered by the Aztecs
as the god of all things good.

28:50.209 --> 28:51.324
Look!

28:52.769 --> 28:54.361
Bienvenido. Welcome.

28:55.169 --> 28:57.285
Good, you speak English.

28:57.489 --> 28:59.844
Yes, of course. Please, come in.

29:02.689 --> 29:04.520
Are you a medicine man?

29:04.609 --> 29:06.520
I prefer "curandero"...

29:06.609 --> 29:10.045
but, yes, medicine man,
shaman, and healer all apply.

29:10.369 --> 29:11.848
How can I help you?

29:12.129 --> 29:15.326
We were hoping you can tell us something
about El Chupacabra.

29:16.529 --> 29:20.204
Like everyone, I have heard the stories
about the big-footed beast.

29:20.929 --> 29:25.002
But there is nothing in the ancient lore
about a monster such as this.

29:25.409 --> 29:28.446
Our animal friends don't harm people
for no reason.

29:29.129 --> 29:31.245
Then how do you explain the attacks?

29:31.489 --> 29:35.164
The only evil force in this land is greed.

29:35.929 --> 29:36.964
Greed?

29:37.169 --> 29:39.808
But what does this have to do
with El Chupacabra?

29:40.689 --> 29:43.761
Recently, people from the north
offered huge sums of money...

29:43.849 --> 29:46.682
to build businesses here
and attract tourists.

29:47.129 --> 29:51.008
The locals turned down the offer,
but when the strangers left...

29:51.169 --> 29:52.807
they vowed to return.

29:54.689 --> 29:56.919
- I see.
- You do?

29:57.489 --> 30:01.243
The answers to all your questions
can be found in the past.

30:02.649 --> 30:05.447
And did I also mention
you're in grave danger?

30:06.849 --> 30:09.443
No, I think you skipped that part.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.325
You're in grave danger.

30:15.169 --> 30:17.763
We better get back to the others
and warn them.

30:20.489 --> 30:22.081
Be careful, my friends.

30:22.729 --> 30:26.085
In Mexico,
things are not always as they seem.

30:26.889 --> 30:30.404
If you have any more questions,
check out my website...

30:30.529 --> 30:35.205
at www.ancientmexicanwisdom.com.

30:36.169 --> 30:37.284
Website?

30:37.569 --> 30:41.005
As I said, expect the unexpected.

30:41.969 --> 30:44.688
Muchas gracias para sus palabras...

30:44.929 --> 30:47.727
sabias de avestruz.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.087
What did you say to him?

30:53.209 --> 30:55.848
I just thanked him
for his wise words of advice.

30:57.649 --> 31:00.402
Thanks for your wise words of ostrich?

31:01.929 --> 31:04.159
Teenagers. Go figure.

31:13.929 --> 31:16.727
Let's head back. We're getting nowhere!

31:17.289 --> 31:18.244
Okay!

31:24.969 --> 31:26.243
Luis, come quick!

31:54.169 --> 31:56.319
Do you hear what I hear, Scoob?

31:57.729 --> 31:59.799
Like, that's not gonna help much.

32:01.449 --> 32:03.007
We better get outta here now...

32:03.089 --> 32:05.762
or we're gonna be
an El Chupacabra fiesta plate!

32:13.769 --> 32:17.728
None of this looks familiar.
Are you sure we're going the right way?

32:18.009 --> 32:20.239
That's Polaris, the North Star.

32:20.409 --> 32:22.923
We should be headed
in the opposite direction.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.082
Trust me. I know where I'm going.

32:28.729 --> 32:29.923
We're sunk.

32:40.129 --> 32:44.361
- Alejo! What happened?
- I was attacked by El Chupacabra.

32:44.689 --> 32:47.522
- Didn't you hear me calling for help?
- No.

32:47.729 --> 32:50.118
Something hit me over the head
and knocked me out.

32:50.209 --> 32:52.040
When I woke up, you were gone.

32:52.209 --> 32:54.439
The Chupacabra is still out there...

32:54.529 --> 32:56.759
and we've got to find the others
before he does.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.805
Like, the next time we go on a trip...

33:02.889 --> 33:05.801
remind me to pick someplace
a little less exciting...

33:05.929 --> 33:08.489
like maybe a librarians' convention?

33:15.369 --> 33:18.441
Zoinks! The brakes aren't working!

33:18.929 --> 33:20.362
- Yikes!
- Rikes!

33:21.329 --> 33:22.444
Look out!

33:23.569 --> 33:25.446
Hold on tight, Scoob!

33:32.569 --> 33:34.924
Like, how do we stop this thing?

33:56.409 --> 34:00.197
Okay, Fred, how do you say
"hopelessly lost" in Spanish?

34:01.049 --> 34:03.882
It looks like the woods get thicker
up ahead.

34:04.049 --> 34:06.438
Do you suppose
we'll meet any wild animals?

34:06.569 --> 34:07.684
We might.

34:07.769 --> 34:10.601
Mostly coyotes and jaguars and boars.

34:11.289 --> 34:12.768
- Coyotes?
- And jaguars?

34:12.849 --> 34:14.282
- And boars.
- Oh, my!

34:19.409 --> 34:21.286
Let's get out of here!

34:31.489 --> 34:32.888
Sorry, guys.

34:32.969 --> 34:34.447
No, we're sorry.

34:34.609 --> 34:37.840
We were hoping to find you close by,
but not that close.

34:37.929 --> 34:40.887
We thought we heard
El Chupacabra. Listen.

34:43.849 --> 34:46.841
That is nothing to be afraid of.
It is just a coyote.

34:46.929 --> 34:48.408
There are lots of them around here.

34:48.489 --> 34:51.161
They are more afraid of you
than you are of them.

34:52.248 --> 34:54.524
Then why is it headed in our direction?

34:54.609 --> 34:58.727
Maybe it is not running towards us,
but away from something else.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.046
- Yeah, but what?
- Like maybe that!

35:08.369 --> 35:10.599
Jinkies! El Chupacabra!

35:11.729 --> 35:12.798
Run!

35:26.049 --> 35:27.641
I think we lost it.

35:29.049 --> 35:32.041
Oh, no! The Mystery Machine!

35:32.849 --> 35:34.168
It's gone!

35:34.649 --> 35:36.401
But its brake fluid isn't.

35:36.729 --> 35:40.119
Someone must've tampered
with the brakes on the Mystery Machine.

35:42.529 --> 35:44.884
We've got to find Shaggy and Scooby!

35:45.009 --> 35:48.888
- Shaggy!
- Scooby-Doo! Where are you?

37:04.249 --> 37:07.047
Jinkies! Perfect timing!

37:08.249 --> 37:10.604
If you and Scooby
hadn't shown up when you did...

37:10.689 --> 37:12.441
we'd be Mexican history.

37:12.609 --> 37:15.726
Yeah, but now that we're safe
from that creepy Bigfoot...

37:15.809 --> 37:18.084
you might want to slow down a little.

37:18.169 --> 37:21.286
I'd love to slow down,
but I have some bad news for you.

37:21.689 --> 37:23.759
- What's that?
- Like, I can't!

37:24.329 --> 37:26.001
The brakes took a break!

37:26.649 --> 37:27.923
Yikes!

37:28.649 --> 37:31.880
- But I have some good news, too.
- Yes?

37:32.369 --> 37:33.802
We're out of gas.

37:34.929 --> 37:38.399
Right in front of a gas station.
What are the chances of that?

37:38.929 --> 37:42.478
Must be the good luck
from my Charlene's medallion.

37:46.289 --> 37:48.166
Well, gang, all set.

37:51.689 --> 37:54.840
Here, Luis. I got you some ice
for that blow to your head.

37:55.169 --> 37:58.002
- It must be pretty swollen by now.
- What happened?

37:58.089 --> 38:00.922
I am afraid my brother
was attacked by El Chupacabra...

38:01.009 --> 38:02.806
and received quite a hit on the head.

38:02.889 --> 38:05.608
It knocked him,
how do you say, "out cold."

38:05.849 --> 38:08.647
Here, let me help. Where's the bump?

38:08.729 --> 38:10.447
I don't see anything.

38:11.609 --> 38:14.407
Right here. I can manage.
Thank you, Daphne.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.642
Where to now, guys?

38:19.849 --> 38:24.161
The curandero said to look to the past,
but what exactly does that mean?

38:24.889 --> 38:25.958
Look!

38:32.489 --> 38:35.720
What better place than a museum
to learn about the past?

38:35.809 --> 38:38.721
Perfect! And we should be able
to get there by morning.

39:03.489 --> 39:06.879
Is it morning already?
I could sure use more sleep.

39:07.369 --> 39:10.486
I could sure use some of Charlene's coffee.

39:10.809 --> 39:12.322
Reah! Roffee!

39:13.449 --> 39:15.041
Guys, look!

39:15.649 --> 39:17.207
"Coming soon to Veracruz."

39:17.289 --> 39:19.644
"Mister Smiley's Latin Adventure"!

39:19.729 --> 39:21.924
Looks like the one we have back home.

39:22.009 --> 39:24.159
Only this one's got a Spanish accent!

39:24.569 --> 39:28.721
If we don't solve the Chupacabra mystery,
the only tourist attraction I foresee...

39:28.809 --> 39:31.004
is one big empty ghost town.

39:48.729 --> 39:50.879
The curandero said to look to the past...

39:50.969 --> 39:53.608
so we might as well start
at the very beginning.

39:55.449 --> 39:58.646
Interesting. Half-man, half-beast.

40:05.289 --> 40:08.247
Look, guys! Like, ancient scooters!

40:10.089 --> 40:14.401
Leave it to Shaggy to come to a museum
and immediately find the toys.

40:45.689 --> 40:48.965
- Jinkies! This place is creepy!
- Good morning!

40:49.609 --> 40:53.488
Are we enjoying ourselves in Mexico City's
national museum? Super!

40:53.569 --> 40:55.844
And would we like
a private tour of the museum...

40:55.929 --> 40:58.363
which begins with a special live,
multimedia show...

40:58.449 --> 41:00.280
about the Aztecs? Super!

41:00.369 --> 41:04.840
Please follow the green directional arrows
on the floor to the special VIP Auditorium.

41:10.369 --> 41:12.280
Please watch your step.

41:14.929 --> 41:18.080
Continue down front
and be seated in the comfy chairs...

41:18.169 --> 41:20.558
made of rich Corinthian leather.

41:20.689 --> 41:22.202
Okay, super!

41:23.489 --> 41:26.128
Let's turn back the hands of time,
shall we?

41:52.529 --> 41:55.601
The war-like Aztecs
had many barbarous rituals.

41:56.049 --> 41:59.166
For example, warriors sacrificed
thousands of captives...

41:59.249 --> 42:00.728
on the altars atop the pyramids...

42:00.809 --> 42:03.881
often ripping out their still-beating hearts
to offer to the gods.

42:03.969 --> 42:07.928
Super. And now I'd like a volunteer
from the audience.

42:11.169 --> 42:13.842
- How about you?
- Freddy?

42:37.329 --> 42:39.320
- Daphne!
- She's gone!

42:40.049 --> 42:43.246
You've been warned!
Please follow the arrows...

42:43.329 --> 42:46.241
to the clearly marked exit doors
to your right. Super!

42:46.329 --> 42:49.560
Excellent idea!
Just like what we had in mind: Exiting.

42:49.649 --> 42:52.721
- Right, Scoob?
- Reah! Rexiting!

42:53.169 --> 42:57.367
- Not so fast, you two!
- We can't leave here until we find Daphne.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.801
And her kidnappers.

43:01.289 --> 43:02.881
Where could they have gone?

43:02.969 --> 43:05.199
Why would someone
want to kidnap Daphne?

43:07.569 --> 43:10.766
Look at this. It looks like
some sort of ripped label...

43:10.849 --> 43:12.840
from one of the warriors' costumes.

43:15.249 --> 43:16.967
I wonder what that means.

43:17.449 --> 43:19.041
Let me see that.

43:20.049 --> 43:21.880
Look! A trap door!

43:22.129 --> 43:23.847
I wonder where it leads to?

43:23.929 --> 43:27.478
My guess is that it will take us
right to Daphne and her kidnappers.

43:27.609 --> 43:29.884
It sure looks like the perfect getaway.

43:30.209 --> 43:32.200
Speaking of getting away...

43:36.049 --> 43:38.517
Come on, guys.
There's no turning back now.

43:38.769 --> 43:41.442
Great, a dark spooky tunnel.

43:41.529 --> 43:43.884
I hate dark spooky tunnels!

45:04.129 --> 45:06.040
Look, here's a door.

45:12.009 --> 45:15.206
- We must be at the pyramids.
- I've read about these.

45:15.449 --> 45:18.202
The pyramids were created
by the Olmec Indians...

45:18.289 --> 45:21.599
who built Mesoamerica's
first great civilization.

45:22.809 --> 45:25.164
It's the Pyramid of
the Feathered Serpent...

45:25.249 --> 45:28.480
the good god we saw a statue of
at the curandero's tent.

45:28.569 --> 45:31.288
Look! At the top! It's Daphne!

45:34.049 --> 45:35.926
Where am I?

45:39.729 --> 45:43.005
Daphne, don't move! We'll be right there!

45:57.049 --> 45:59.802
Like, if the Aztecs were so brilliant...

46:00.649 --> 46:04.085
why didn't they invent an elevator?

46:05.609 --> 46:07.884
Reah, relevator!

46:10.529 --> 46:12.520
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!

46:13.129 --> 46:16.087
- What happened to you?
- I'm not sure.

46:16.169 --> 46:19.206
I was blindfolded the whole time
by that fake museum guide...

46:19.289 --> 46:20.927
and her warrior friend.

46:21.049 --> 46:23.199
Let's get out of here
before they come back for you.

46:25.729 --> 46:28.960
That's odd. This statue wasn't here before.

46:36.169 --> 46:37.568
What's going on?

46:42.849 --> 46:44.282
Hello, mis amigos.

46:44.369 --> 46:46.883
I am Paco, the magical talking eagle.

46:47.169 --> 46:50.002
I protect the pyramids here
at the place of the gods.

46:50.649 --> 46:54.085
That's the worst Spanish accent
I've ever heard.

46:54.329 --> 46:57.844
I know, he looks like a character
from a tacky theme park!

46:57.929 --> 47:00.443
These evil tourists
have destroyed a sacred idol...

47:00.529 --> 47:02.326
and angered the gods.

47:02.529 --> 47:05.282
We did no such thing!
This eagle is lying to you.

47:05.529 --> 47:07.087
Do not believe their lies.

47:07.169 --> 47:09.763
When the cage lifts,
you must run them out of here...

47:09.849 --> 47:12.238
before they completely ruin the ruins.

47:12.609 --> 47:15.487
If you don't,
the gods will seek revenge themselves...

47:15.569 --> 47:19.164
and ay caramba, mis amigos,
you don't want to see that!

47:45.169 --> 47:46.682
Quick! In here!

47:54.529 --> 47:56.645
There's tons of spiders down here!

47:56.729 --> 47:58.208
Spiders!

47:59.089 --> 48:02.240
No, guys, actually these are scorpions.

48:02.689 --> 48:05.522
Gee, thanks. I feel much better now.

48:05.849 --> 48:10.001
Don't worry about the scorpions.
I'm sure the rats'll take care of them.

48:13.529 --> 48:14.848
Rats!

48:27.049 --> 48:29.882
Jinkies, we must be in the ancient tombs!

48:37.849 --> 48:40.602
Don't worry, Shaggy.
Everything in here is dead.

48:40.729 --> 48:42.924
Like, how comforting!

48:43.209 --> 48:45.359
Look, we can disguise ourselves...

48:45.449 --> 48:49.078
by wearing the traditional clothing
of the native Indian skeletons!

48:51.289 --> 48:53.007
Just act natural.

48:55.129 --> 48:56.084
Look!

48:56.169 --> 48:58.683
It's the vandals trying
to disguise themselves...

48:58.769 --> 49:02.842
by wearing the traditional clothing
of the native Indian skeletons!

51:34.409 --> 51:35.478
Help!

52:10.449 --> 52:13.407
Senor Fuente! What's he doing here?

52:13.609 --> 52:15.327
Trying to attack you.

52:41.089 --> 52:43.557
I am, amigos, mi Paco!

52:46.089 --> 52:49.320
IAy caramba! Ay caramba!

52:51.529 --> 52:53.281
Magical eagle!

52:53.369 --> 52:56.805
I didn't buy this animatronic imposter
for one minute.

52:58.089 --> 53:00.045
I guess the curandero was right.

53:00.129 --> 53:02.723
Things in Mexico aren't always
what they seem.

53:03.009 --> 53:04.647
Come on, we better get out of here...

53:04.729 --> 53:08.165
before these mysterious mischief-makers
try and top themselves.

53:57.049 --> 53:58.084
Rouch!

54:02.369 --> 54:05.008
How awful to witness something like that.

54:05.529 --> 54:08.441
You are so strong, Dolores. Like a bull.

54:09.009 --> 54:10.886
Some people have all the luck.

54:10.969 --> 54:14.405
Why can't the Chupacabra
carry off my future daughter-in-law?

54:15.609 --> 54:17.839
What's going on? Are you all right?

54:18.409 --> 54:19.922
Where's Charlene?

54:21.529 --> 54:24.999
Please calm down, both of you.
There is nothing to be upset about.

54:25.369 --> 54:28.759
El Chupacabra has run off
with your fiancee!

54:28.849 --> 54:30.760
We'll never see her again!

54:37.809 --> 54:40.164
Please, somebody tell us what happened.

54:40.249 --> 54:42.763
It all started just moments after you left.

54:42.849 --> 54:45.807
We were in the cafe,
your mother, Charlene, and I.

54:45.889 --> 54:48.278
El Chupacabra broke down the door...

54:48.369 --> 54:51.122
picked up Charlene in his arms
and ran off with her!

54:52.689 --> 54:55.806
This is terrible. I never should have left.

54:55.889 --> 54:58.403
Jinkies! And she's still missing?

54:58.929 --> 55:02.046
Yes. We've been looking for her
since yesterday.

55:02.329 --> 55:04.524
The villagers are continuing the search.

55:04.609 --> 55:07.487
Here, at the cemetery, and up in the hills.

55:09.009 --> 55:12.240
I am El Chupacabra! I am going to eat you!

55:14.449 --> 55:17.646
All this talk of El Chupacabra
is not good for the children.

55:19.529 --> 55:22.043
Now, forget all about
this scary monster nonsense...

55:22.129 --> 55:24.848
and play with your skeletons
among the tombstones.

55:25.849 --> 55:27.760
I must go join the search.

55:28.289 --> 55:32.840
Yes, but it'll be more productive
if we first get all our facts straight.

55:33.889 --> 55:37.040
I think the village is being terrorized
for a reason.

55:37.129 --> 55:41.281
Somebody wants him to scare
everyone off and get us out of the way.

55:41.369 --> 55:43.360
But what's to be gained from that?

55:43.449 --> 55:47.806
El Chupacabra is scaring off the tourists,
making businesses suffer.

55:48.169 --> 55:50.478
If the Oteros are forced to sell...

55:50.569 --> 55:54.448
Senor Fuente gets what he wants:
The Oteros' land.

55:54.809 --> 55:55.764
Good point.

55:55.849 --> 55:58.807
But what does that have to do
with El Chupacabra?

55:58.929 --> 56:01.124
The footprints leading away
from the cottage...

56:01.209 --> 56:05.407
suggested El Chupacabra was scared off
once Shaggy alerted the rest of us.

56:06.169 --> 56:09.286
Some monster.
He was okay scaring Scoob and me...

56:09.369 --> 56:11.803
but chickened out
when there were more of us.

56:13.209 --> 56:14.847
Maybe he's a fake.

56:14.929 --> 56:17.682
I don't think
we can rule out the supernatural.

56:17.769 --> 56:19.487
Supernatural?

56:19.569 --> 56:22.322
If the creatures at the pyramids
were special effects...

56:22.409 --> 56:24.400
they were pretty special.

56:24.489 --> 56:26.286
And very effective!

56:26.529 --> 56:29.726
Real or fake,
somebody's been following us.

56:30.249 --> 56:33.002
Yeah, they're anticipating our every move.

56:33.609 --> 56:36.999
- But how?
- Let's look at my videotape again.

56:42.089 --> 56:43.647
Wait! Freeze the frame!

56:45.009 --> 56:48.604
Look, whoever wrote "manana,"
the Spanish word for "tomorrow"...

56:48.689 --> 56:50.008
forgot the tilde.

56:50.089 --> 56:51.442
What's a tilde?

56:51.649 --> 56:54.800
It's a symbol you put over the "n"
to change the pronunciation.

56:54.889 --> 56:57.357
Without it, the word would be said
incorrectly as...

56:57.449 --> 56:59.644
"manana," instead of "man-yan-a"...

56:59.729 --> 57:02.641
a mistake no real Spanish-speaking person
would ever make.

57:02.729 --> 57:05.607
Looks like your Spanish lessons
are finally paying off.

57:06.689 --> 57:08.168
Muchas gracias.

57:08.409 --> 57:11.321
So the bad guy doesn't speak Spanish.

57:11.689 --> 57:15.568
Maybe. But there's always the possibility
there's more than one bad guy.

57:15.769 --> 57:19.887
Velma, did you save the torn label
from the fake warrior's costume?

57:20.129 --> 57:22.927
Sure did, but I still don't know
what it means.

57:25.369 --> 57:29.123
Sorry to interrupt,
but it's time for us to pay our respects.

57:29.809 --> 57:33.040
- We're all ready to go.
- Please feel free to join us.

57:50.529 --> 57:53.521
My homemade mango salsa, your favorite.

57:54.129 --> 57:58.327
And from Charlene,
a cup of her cafe lechera.

57:58.809 --> 58:02.040
Maybe if he knows where she is,
he will send us a sign.

58:12.329 --> 58:14.365
I am the ghost...

58:14.609 --> 58:17.077
of Senor Otero.

58:18.209 --> 58:20.325
Don't be alarmed.

58:20.569 --> 58:22.878
As you all know, today is the day...

58:22.969 --> 58:26.006
we spirits return to Earth...

58:26.089 --> 58:28.080
to commune with the living.

58:31.009 --> 58:32.920
Mama, please, wake up!

58:34.289 --> 58:37.281
I have learned that El Chupacabra...

58:37.369 --> 58:40.122
is the result of an evil curse...

58:40.569 --> 58:42.719
placed upon our land.

58:42.809 --> 58:45.846
The only way to break the spell...

58:45.929 --> 58:48.204
is to get rid of that land.

58:48.289 --> 58:50.519
Once the land is sold...

58:50.609 --> 58:54.238
El Chupacabra will vanish forever...

58:54.609 --> 58:58.682
and Charlene will be returned, unharmed.

59:03.889 --> 59:06.562
That doesn't look or sound
anything like my father!

59:06.649 --> 59:08.640
Someone is playing a trick on us!

59:09.849 --> 59:11.487
Can I see your medallion?

59:13.169 --> 59:16.161
Just as I suspected. It's a tracking device.

59:16.969 --> 59:19.164
Let's see if it works in reverse.

59:40.809 --> 59:44.438
Now, stop that now! Now, be quiet!
Do you hear me? Quiet!

59:48.489 --> 59:51.322
Please! Ignore the stupid dog!

59:52.849 --> 59:55.841
Pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain.

59:57.489 --> 59:59.639
Leave the cemetery at once!

59:59.849 --> 01:00:03.205
It is cursed! The whole town is cursed!

01:00:03.769 --> 01:00:07.648
Sell the land
and everything will return to normal!

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:13.244
Can't you see? Many of them
don't understand your foreign language.

01:00:13.369 --> 01:00:15.360
Speaking Spanish might help!

01:00:16.089 --> 01:00:18.125
I don't know how to speak Spanish!

01:00:18.369 --> 01:00:20.599
Why can't everyone just learn English?

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.159
Like, not so fast, senor.

01:00:37.929 --> 01:00:39.806
It's Mister Smiley!

01:00:40.529 --> 01:00:42.201
Officers.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:51.318
We suspected that "mile" and "enter"
were part of bigger words...

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:55.085
and look, we were right!
"Smiley Entertainment."

01:00:55.689 --> 01:00:58.487
When Mister Smiley
was unable to convince the locals...

01:00:58.569 --> 01:01:02.608
to sell their land for his new theme park,
he turned to the Otero family.

01:01:02.689 --> 01:01:06.079
Their hotel is built on
some of the best real estate in Veracruz.

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:09.605
When they refused to sell,
he wouldn't take no for an answer.

01:01:10.089 --> 01:01:13.286
So he terrorized the tourists
with the Chupacabra attacks...

01:01:13.409 --> 01:01:17.163
hoping to ruin the Otero's hotel business
and force them to sell.

01:01:17.489 --> 01:01:22.040
And then he did everything he could
to prevent us from revealing his scheme.

01:01:22.209 --> 01:01:24.677
Smiley was the perfect person
to pull it off.

01:01:25.209 --> 01:01:26.324
Why?

01:01:26.409 --> 01:01:28.877
Please. You're only encouraging him.

01:01:29.129 --> 01:01:30.687
Being the head of a theme park...

01:01:30.769 --> 01:01:34.045
he had access to the best special effects
money can buy.

01:01:34.209 --> 01:01:36.439
Like, not to mention
the animatronic animals...

01:01:36.529 --> 01:01:38.724
like our magical eagle friend, Paco.

01:01:39.249 --> 01:01:42.127
Ay caramba!

01:01:46.809 --> 01:01:49.642
And by kidnapping me
and framing us as vandals...

01:01:49.729 --> 01:01:51.924
he was able to derail our investigation...

01:01:52.009 --> 01:01:55.001
and create bad publicity for the pyramids.

01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:57.121
...soon to be his chief competitor...

01:01:57.209 --> 01:01:59.677
for the dollars of tourists
all over the world.

01:02:00.169 --> 01:02:02.239
Our deductions make perfect sense.

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:05.042
But if Smiley is behind
the Chupacabra attacks...

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:07.484
then how do we explain that?

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:16.288
That sure doesn't look like
a special effect to me!

01:02:16.609 --> 01:02:19.646
- It is the monster!
- El Chupacabra!

01:02:21.929 --> 01:02:24.523
Like, this is gonna be bad. Real bad.

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.687
You don't scare us,
you big Bigfoot wannabe!

01:04:55.169 --> 01:04:57.046
They caught the monster!

01:04:57.209 --> 01:05:00.724
We caught something,
but "monster" might be a little strong.

01:05:00.969 --> 01:05:03.529
Well! We certainly weren't expecting that.

01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:05.604
Were we?

01:05:08.729 --> 01:05:12.642
Please, leave her alone!
She only did what I asked her to do.

01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:14.447
I'm the guilty one, not her.

01:05:14.529 --> 01:05:16.804
Hardly. It takes two to tango.

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:18.722
I'm afraid she's right.

01:05:18.809 --> 01:05:21.926
Smiley didn't have to pull my leg
to be part of his scheme.

01:05:22.009 --> 01:05:23.203
I love him.

01:05:25.409 --> 01:05:28.845
You see, I worked as an actress
and stuntwoman at his theme park.

01:05:29.249 --> 01:05:31.763
When I visited one day,
it was love at first sight.

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:36.083
Speaking of love,
where is my fiancee, Charlene?

01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:39.481
I'm afraid
you won't be seeing her ever again.

01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:43.319
Pick up the pieces of your shattered life
and find someone new.

01:05:44.249 --> 01:05:48.367
I can't accept that!
Papa, I asked for a sign, Papa.

01:05:48.449 --> 01:05:51.486
Anything to show us
where Charlene might be.

01:05:51.769 --> 01:05:54.806
Please don't let your firstborn son down.

01:05:57.289 --> 01:06:00.645
Look! The gifts we left for him are gone!

01:06:01.009 --> 01:06:03.239
The only thing that's left
is the cafe lechera...

01:06:03.329 --> 01:06:04.967
that Charlene made for him.

01:06:05.049 --> 01:06:08.359
- I don't understand.
- I'm beginning to.

01:06:09.209 --> 01:06:10.801
I was afraid of that.

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:17.326
I seem to recall someone mentioning
coffee grinds...

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:20.800
coming out of their ears
from working in the cafe all day.

01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:28.164
Charlene, I thought you loved me.

01:06:28.369 --> 01:06:31.725
Would you wake up
and smell the cafe lechera...

01:06:31.809 --> 01:06:33.845
you pea-brained romantic!

01:06:34.329 --> 01:06:37.241
I never loved you, I loved your money!

01:06:37.329 --> 01:06:40.127
I mean, if we got married,
your inheritance would become mine!

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:43.042
Then I was fixing to drop you
like a hot tamale...

01:06:43.129 --> 01:06:45.882
and share my riches
with my little honeybunch here.

01:06:46.649 --> 01:06:49.959
But that goody-goody brother of yours
had to complicate everything.

01:06:50.049 --> 01:06:53.598
Mister "I want to respect father's wishes,"
over there.

01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:56.679
Thank goodness you're all okay.

01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:03.363
You mean you knew about all of this?

01:07:03.729 --> 01:07:05.481
Please, let me explain.

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:10.362
I admit I tried to convince you
to sell your land.

01:07:11.049 --> 01:07:14.758
But I finally accepted that you would
never go against your father's wishes...

01:07:14.849 --> 01:07:16.601
and I respected that.

01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:18.481
But these two characters...

01:07:18.569 --> 01:07:21.800
don't understand things
like loyalty and family.

01:07:22.489 --> 01:07:24.957
When I heard of their
harebrained Bigfoot scheme...

01:07:25.049 --> 01:07:27.165
I tried to track you down at the pyramids.

01:07:27.249 --> 01:07:29.809
Not to harm you, but to warn you.

01:07:30.569 --> 01:07:33.527
I understand. Please accept my apologies.

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:36.523
And please accept our apologies, Luis.

01:07:36.849 --> 01:07:40.080
I have to admit, there were times
when we questioned your integrity.

01:07:40.169 --> 01:07:41.318
We were wrong.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:44.443
I can see how misunderstandings happen.

01:07:44.529 --> 01:07:48.283
From now on, I will try to look
beyond the surface to what lies beneath.

01:07:48.769 --> 01:07:50.999
What happens now, hon?

01:07:51.169 --> 01:07:53.808
We go to jail! What do you think happens?

01:07:54.129 --> 01:07:58.008
We could've made billions if it hadn't been
for those meddling kids!

01:08:01.449 --> 01:08:05.158
I never trusted Senorita Charlene,
that bruja.

01:08:05.689 --> 01:08:06.963
"Bruja"?

01:08:07.129 --> 01:08:08.562
That means, "witch."

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:12.597
Alejo, I have something to confess.

01:08:13.449 --> 01:08:14.643
Yes, brother?

01:08:14.729 --> 01:08:16.685
Hermano, when you called out for help...

01:08:16.769 --> 01:08:20.158
I did hear you,
but I was paralyzed with fear.

01:08:20.249 --> 01:08:22.205
After losing Papa last year...

01:08:22.288 --> 01:08:25.247
I panicked at the thought
of losing my only brother.

01:08:25.809 --> 01:08:28.482
So I lied and said
the Bigfoot knocked me out.

01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:32.841
I'm sorry for being a coward, Alejo.
I pray it never happens again.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:36.526
There are worse things
than being a coward.

01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:40.038
Like, I've made a career out of it!

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:44.242
So I guess there never was
a real Chupacabra.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:48.322
- I wonder how that myth got started.
- Like all myths, I guess.

01:08:48.849 --> 01:08:52.558
Since the beginning of time,
men and women have loved to tell stories.

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:54.839
And what better reason
for creating them...

01:08:54.929 --> 01:08:57.523
than to explain the many things
we don't understand...

01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:59.008
and maybe never will?

01:08:59.089 --> 01:09:03.082
Like how they can pack so much flavor
into one piece of fruit?

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:15.522
At least our ancestors had the good sense
to create a way...

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.486
to work off all those calories.

01:09:38.849 --> 01:09:40.567
Scooby-dooby-doo!

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.282
Radios!
