WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:05.179
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team...

00:05.222 --> 00:06.789
I know all about looking out
for Bravo 1.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.052
20 years of combat is eventually
gonna catch up with him.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.749
Just want to make sure we can
clock it before it's too late.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.055
<i>Someone tipped Command</i>

00:12.099 --> 00:14.362
to my behavior on deployment.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.191
- Stella's pregnant.
- I knew you could do it.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.238
Jason?

00:21.282 --> 00:22.892
- Mandy. <i>
I've evolved.</i>

00:22.935 --> 00:23.980
<i>That's why we're hanging out</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:25.503
in Rehoboth
instead of Vah Beach.

00:25.547 --> 00:28.028
<i>Curious timing
with Mandy being around.</i>

00:28.071 --> 00:29.594
You two make
a lot of sense together.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.118
Damn shame if you
can't see that for yourself.

00:31.161 --> 00:31.944
<i>I'm suggesting</i>

00:31.988 --> 00:33.511
you and Leanne move here

00:33.555 --> 00:35.513
and live together as a family.
Don't you think we owe it

00:35.557 --> 00:38.647
<i>to our daughter to at least try
to make our family whole?</i>

00:38.690 --> 00:40.170
Whatever time I have left,

00:40.214 --> 00:42.825
I'd like to try to repair
things, if you'll let me.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.174
<i>If you're excited about Mandy,</i>

00:44.218 --> 00:46.829
- then be excited.
- Just pump the brakes, okay?

00:46.872 --> 00:48.178
We're just having fun.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.224
Please don't be your own
worst enemy for a change.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.617
Hi, Mandy.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.152
Master Chief?

01:51.328 --> 01:53.548
Where's your cane?

03:23.594 --> 03:25.248
Uh...

03:25.292 --> 03:27.511
Brock, you got to stop with
that-that lip-smacking, okay?

03:27.555 --> 03:28.904
It's driving me
absolutely crazy.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.253
It's making me feel sick, okay?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.385
I'm just trying to put
the pieces together,

03:31.428 --> 03:32.908
find this turtle here.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.257
See this little parrotfish,
little barracuda?

03:34.301 --> 03:35.780
Why wouldn't you start
with the borders?

03:35.824 --> 03:37.826
We've been trapped in here

03:37.869 --> 03:41.003
for three days,
and you idiots are still stuck

03:41.046 --> 03:43.484
on this same freakin' puzzle?

03:44.833 --> 03:46.530
- What a dick.
- Say, are you sure

03:46.574 --> 03:48.924
that Brock didn't accidently eat
any of the pieces?

03:48.967 --> 03:50.447
All I know
is that time is standing still

03:50.491 --> 03:53.189
since we've been in this place.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.104
Wonder how it feels for Trent.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.541
The docs put him in that coma
to help his recovery.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.456
Yeah.
- He'll be good.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.937
Yeah, his-his brain, you know,

04:01.980 --> 04:06.463
probably needs some time off
anyways. Am I right?

04:07.334 --> 04:08.900
Well...

04:08.944 --> 04:11.120
at least
we get to go home today.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.164
Yeah.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.820
- Turtle.
- More ocean.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.432
No, listen,
I did 45 days outside the wire,

04:18.475 --> 04:20.085
and I'm telling you,
there was no toilet,

04:20.129 --> 04:22.697
there was no shower, there was
zero, zero combat jacks, okay?

04:22.740 --> 04:25.787
And that is easy days
compared to this purgatory.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.049
Well, you
didn't really expect Bravo

04:27.092 --> 04:29.878
to stay calm in the calm,
did you?

04:29.921 --> 04:32.968
Puzzle says
it's for ages five and up.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.293
Supposed to be staying off
that knee.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.125
Docs are pretty confident

05:00.169 --> 05:02.563
Trent's gonna pull through,
Jace.

05:02.606 --> 05:05.000
You've earned some rest.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.916
A complete mission failure.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.048
That earns me nothing.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.790
No. The op was a success.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.227
My whole team...

05:15.271 --> 05:17.186
is injured, Ray.

05:18.143 --> 05:23.018
It was supposed to be a
straightforward capture-kill op.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.761
Brother, you and I both know

05:26.804 --> 05:30.895
there's nothing straightforward
about this line of work.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.422
Look, man, let's hit
the cafeteria, all right?

05:35.465 --> 05:38.773
I hear they got schnitzel.
You love schnitzel.

05:41.645 --> 05:46.215
Fixating on what happened
isn't gonna change anything.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.657
<i>Yeah, they just, you know,
all they did was just...</i>

05:53.701 --> 05:57.835
<i>draw some blood and...
take some measurements and...</i>

05:57.879 --> 06:00.969
<i>I really almost just
fell asleep on the exam table,</i>

06:01.012 --> 06:03.450
<i>until I remembered my husband's
in the hospital.</i>

06:03.493 --> 06:04.842
Don't stress.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.323
All right? It's not good
for you or the baby.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.412
- I'm fine. <i>
- Considering you've been, um,</i>

06:09.456 --> 06:13.373
<i>shot, fragged and blown up, our
definition of "fine" may vary.</i>

06:15.418 --> 06:17.768
The only thing wrong with me
was missing

06:17.812 --> 06:19.553
- your appointment. <i>
- Well,</i>

06:19.596 --> 06:24.427
<i>being in a hospital in Germany,
uh, is a very good excuse.</i>

06:24.471 --> 06:26.777
Least I'll make it home in time

06:26.821 --> 06:29.301
to take Ash
to his chemo infusion.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.999
<i>Yep.</i>

06:31.042 --> 06:34.306
I never thought I'd be a better
son than a husband or father.

06:34.350 --> 06:37.135
<i>Don't say that.
Please don't say that.</i>

06:37.179 --> 06:40.443
<i>You're doing an amazing job
taking care of us both, okay?</i>

06:40.487 --> 06:44.795
<i>Just... focus
on getting better, please.</i>

06:45.535 --> 06:47.319
<i>I love you.</i>

06:47.363 --> 06:49.539
Love you, too.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.411
Talk soon.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.117
How's, uh,
Stella and the baby-to-be?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.467
Uh...

07:04.511 --> 07:08.428
Yeah. Doc says the baby's
the size of a grapefruit.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.867
But I wish
I could've been there.

07:12.910 --> 07:15.086
Yeah, man.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.742
It's always...

07:18.786 --> 07:20.831
it's always difficult
observing life

07:20.875 --> 07:23.138
through a damn screen, yeah?

07:23.181 --> 07:26.358
Especially with so much
going on back home.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.491
Is everything okay?

07:28.535 --> 07:32.190
Yeah. Yeah, we just, uh...

07:32.234 --> 07:35.455
we've been helping out
this homeless vet Sam.

07:36.238 --> 07:39.894
Naima's been shouldering all the
work while I've been stuck here.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.549
That's a noble undertaking.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.377
Yeah, well, after what we've
seen in Africa and Afghanistan,

07:45.421 --> 07:49.033
it's just nice to feel
like I'm making an impact.

07:50.557 --> 07:54.125
Yeah. It's better than
the impact that put us in here.

07:54.169 --> 07:56.214
Yeah.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.912
Is Jace still taking it hard?

07:57.955 --> 07:59.696
Man refuses to ease up
on himself,

07:59.740 --> 08:04.048
even though we-we all know it
was an RPG to blame and not him.

08:04.092 --> 08:07.225
So I'm trying to lift
his spirits a little bit,

08:07.269 --> 08:11.273
- and I think you can help.
- Honestly, I'll take anything

08:11.316 --> 08:13.536
that gives me a break
from Sonny and Brock.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.799
There's that.

08:15.843 --> 08:20.151
So, given Jason's, uh,
conspicuous gallantry...

08:20.195 --> 08:23.720
on the op, he's likely
gonna be considered for a medal.

08:23.764 --> 08:26.157
Jason's not exactly
a medal jumper.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.943
Precisely why I need someone
to take down statements

08:28.986 --> 08:31.075
from the rest of the team
about his actions.

08:31.119 --> 08:35.253
But he cannot catch wind, okay?
He cannot know.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.604
Well, some bird shit
might be a nice way

08:37.647 --> 08:40.041
to recognize
all of his sacrifices.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.825
All right. I'll go first.

08:41.869 --> 08:45.350
All right. Hey, look,
if you're forcing me to do this,

08:45.394 --> 08:47.831
I'm gonna do it right.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.572
Okay, so,

08:49.616 --> 08:54.490
uh, Bravo was running a joint op
with a GIGN partner force

08:54.534 --> 08:57.580
on a, um, enemy safe house.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.234
Multiple tangos on target.

08:59.277 --> 09:01.149
Uh, the French were
the mobility element,

09:01.192 --> 09:06.154
posted outside with Trent
and the gun trucks, while...

09:06.197 --> 09:09.549
<i>the rest of Bravo was
the assault force.</i>

09:09.592 --> 09:11.942
<i>We entered the south entrance
of the building,</i>

09:11.986 --> 09:14.162
<i>split the train,
then started clearing rooms</i>

09:14.205 --> 09:16.904
<i>north through the target.</i>

09:43.408 --> 09:45.193
I called Trent to get
more rifles in the fight,

09:45.236 --> 09:47.456
but I never got a response.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.024
Bravo 4, I say again,

09:50.067 --> 09:51.678
I need four in!

09:51.721 --> 09:52.983
How copy?

09:54.985 --> 09:56.683
Bravo 4, radio check! Over!

09:56.726 --> 09:58.554
<i>Bravo 2, this is 1.</i>

09:58.598 --> 10:00.556
<i>Your comms aren't making it
outside the building.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:04.125
<i>I'll head back outside,
get some more shooters.</i>

10:04.952 --> 10:06.910
Good copy, 1! Sooner the better!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.959
Should've set
your flux capacitor

10:12.002 --> 10:14.526
three minutes ago,
Blondie McFly.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.574
More firepower

10:18.618 --> 10:19.706
than we expected.

10:19.749 --> 10:22.360
Sounds like they
got friends outside, too.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.276
RPG tango! North ridge.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.020
Keep hammering!

10:33.981 --> 10:36.374
And the next thing I know,
Jason's pulling me out,

10:36.418 --> 10:38.768
and then he went back in and
pulled the rest of you guys out.

10:38.812 --> 10:41.989
It reads like a World War II
medal citation.

10:42.032 --> 10:45.340
Yeah. It's nice
to hear you say that.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.907
Lately I've been feeling like, uh,

10:46.950 --> 10:49.213
you thought
we needed to watch Jason's six.

10:49.997 --> 10:52.739
Op proved that
he's watching ours.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.959
Same as you're doing for him.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.745
Yeah, I'm not sure
everybody feels that way.

11:00.747 --> 11:04.446
Someone talked to Command
about my actions in Nigeria.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.232
Questioned my fitness for duty.

11:08.276 --> 11:09.973
Dirty business,

11:10.017 --> 11:13.455
putting your bird
in the crosshairs like that.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.458
I hope it blows over, man.

11:18.895 --> 11:21.332
What are you doing?
Uh...

11:21.376 --> 11:23.378
You can't pull a piece
out after you've dropped it in.

11:23.421 --> 11:26.033
Yeah. Right. Look. This one
slipped. It was an accident.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.383
This hospital food's giving me
the bubble guts.

11:28.426 --> 11:29.732
Eh!

11:29.776 --> 11:32.474
My hands are sweatier
than dew on Dixie.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.086
Wh-Why would you do
something like that?

11:36.130 --> 11:37.871
I was just about to win.
I had five straight across.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.046
By cheating.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.438
You ain't cheating,
you ain't trying.

11:40.482 --> 11:43.790
What's the, uh,
action like in here?

11:43.833 --> 11:45.313
Meeting of the mindless,

11:45.356 --> 11:47.184
- that's what it is.
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.839 --> 11:52.537
Hey, Sonny, why don't you
go check in with Hannah

11:52.581 --> 11:55.323
and give our ears a break?

11:55.366 --> 11:59.457
Uh, wow, I haven't touched base
with her since we spun up.

11:59.501 --> 12:02.243
She doesn't know
you're in the hospital?

12:03.418 --> 12:07.901
Radio silence is not
the comforting balm

12:07.944 --> 12:09.641
you think it is, brother.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.775
Uh, once we, uh,
once we discharge tonight,

12:12.819 --> 12:15.735
I'm gonna call her up
and I'm gonna turn up

12:15.778 --> 12:17.562
the old Sonny Quinn charm.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.521
Nobody's being discharged
tonight.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.045
Doctor wants more brain scans.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.875
You're all under observation
for another 48 hours.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.760
Aw, this is bullshit, man.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.762
We got better things to do

12:42.805 --> 12:44.415
than get probed
by the pecker-checkers.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.548
Can they really
hold us here against our will?

12:46.591 --> 12:47.810
This is America.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.377
This is Germany, Brock.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.814
Doesn't matter
where we are, okay?

12:51.858 --> 12:54.817
Our-our-our ninja skills
should translate.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.993
All right? So I have an idea.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.995
Why don't we just
bust the hell out of here

12:59.039 --> 13:01.693
and end this tour as,
uh, as lab rats?

13:01.737 --> 13:03.043
- I'm in.
- What do you mean you're in?

13:03.086 --> 13:04.871
Okay? It's a military hospital.
You break out,

13:04.914 --> 13:06.742
- you're AWOL.
- A career-ender

13:06.786 --> 13:08.352
just to wander around
rural Germany.

13:08.396 --> 13:11.268
You know, that might be one
of your dumber ideas, Sonny.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.575
And that is saying a lot.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.185
Look at you two.

13:15.229 --> 13:18.188
Okay, well, what the hell
are we supposed to do, man?

13:18.232 --> 13:20.712
I'm-I'm tired of being captive.

13:21.496 --> 13:22.540
Hey, you know,
we got to do something

13:22.584 --> 13:24.064
with this pent-up aggression.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.935
You remember them Gucci
deployments we used to have,

13:25.979 --> 13:28.416
friendly competition
to pass the time?

13:28.459 --> 13:30.853
Some hospital Olympics
might be a way

13:30.897 --> 13:32.246
to keep us
from climbing the walls.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.770
Ugh, that's terrible.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.167
Jace.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.044
If you sign on,
they'll fall in line.

13:48.088 --> 13:50.742
Nobody wants to play games,
Ray, okay? Let it go.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.788
Oh, it's better we fall apart
at the seams?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.052
Bravo's already got enough eyes
on it after this op.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.402
And disorderly conduct
inside a military hospital

13:58.446 --> 13:59.926
is not gonna help.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.668
Create a little chaos...

14:03.712 --> 14:06.410
- to keep us all calm.
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.586
The docs are saying
Trent's doing better.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.110
If he was here,
he'd be the first in line.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.764
- Yeah, huh?
- Uh-huh.

Checkered flag, my ass!

15:34.107 --> 15:36.196
Yeah, when you mention
the Welton case again,

15:36.239 --> 15:39.199
it seems redundant.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.374
And that's it.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.028
I think it's coming together.

15:42.071 --> 15:44.508
Usually hate notes, but...
this was painless.

15:44.552 --> 15:47.859
I detected a slight eye roll
around page 24, so...

15:47.903 --> 15:50.775
But now is your chance
for payback, okay?

15:50.819 --> 15:53.735
So... what do you got for me?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.737
Uh, page 13.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.868
Okay.

15:56.912 --> 15:59.349
You have a typo
in your section heading.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.961
- All right.
- And on page 47,

16:02.004 --> 16:03.963
you misspelled
"General Keating."

16:04.006 --> 16:05.703
What?

16:05.747 --> 16:07.444
"Feating."

16:08.271 --> 16:09.707
That would have been
embarrassing.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.709
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.929
- Okay, what else?
- That's it.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.017
The rest is perfect.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.977
So, I was thinking,
for dinner...

16:18.020 --> 16:18.978
Oh, r-really?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.414
Come on, I mean,

16:20.457 --> 16:24.070
the only thing worse
than a ton of notes is no notes.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.201
Trust me, it's fantastic.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.203
I don't need you
to go easy on me

16:27.247 --> 16:28.596
because we're dating.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.598
I'd love to show you
how this shrewd mind

16:30.641 --> 16:32.252
can pick apart arguments,

16:32.295 --> 16:33.601
but...

16:33.644 --> 16:36.343
you lay out your case
flawlessly.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.085
What's got you so stressed?

16:39.128 --> 16:43.045
The important eyes
that are gonna be on our papers.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.873
I-I got to get this right.

16:44.916 --> 16:47.789
Also guessing you're worried
about your teammates?

16:48.572 --> 16:51.010
Look, their close call
only reinforces

16:51.053 --> 16:53.012
the arguments in my paper.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.622
We need to be prioritizing

16:54.665 --> 16:57.103
our warfighters
over warfighting.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.757
Lucky for your SEALs, the people
who'll be reading your thesis

16:59.801 --> 17:02.064
have the power to influence
the change you call for.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.023
That's why I got to hit
the bull's-eye.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.764
The higher-ups might not like
facing the hard truths,

17:06.808 --> 17:09.463
but shining the light is the
first step to effecting change.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.465
If you need to hear it
from someone

17:11.508 --> 17:13.641
who doesn't go weak in the knees
when you smile,

17:13.684 --> 17:16.687
or who has military expertise...

17:17.514 --> 17:19.821
...get a second opinion.

17:22.824 --> 17:25.261
<i>Okay, so two more days?</i>

17:26.045 --> 17:28.003
Yeah. Means
I won't make it home in time

17:28.047 --> 17:31.050
to take Ash
to his chemo infusion.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.921
<i>-Well, I'll take him.
- You got office hours.</i>

17:32.964 --> 17:34.444
You shouldn't be
on your feet all day.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.925
<i>I'm not the first pregnant woman
in history. I can take him.</i>

17:36.968 --> 17:39.754
<i>You just focus on you
and Bravo, okay?</i>

17:40.537 --> 17:42.104
I feel like I'm...

17:42.148 --> 17:44.106
doing a better job
emulating Jason as an operator

17:44.150 --> 17:46.065
than Ray as a family man.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.458
<i>How is Jason?</i>

17:48.502 --> 17:51.244
<i>Another explosion
can't be good for his head.</i>

17:51.287 --> 17:54.073
I mean, fortunately,
he wasn't near the blast.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.119
He's actually the reason
we're alive.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.644
<i>Good... morning, Ramstein!</i>

18:00.688 --> 18:03.560
<i>Here's a little something
from Okefenokee Joe himself,</i>

18:03.604 --> 18:07.086
<i>the legendary Dick Flood!</i>

18:07.129 --> 18:09.566
<i>Uh, what is that?</i>

18:11.264 --> 18:14.049
It's Sonny putting points on
the board for our competition.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.833
<i>Of course you guys
are playing games</i>

18:15.877 --> 18:17.487
<i>instead of recuperating.</i>

18:18.923 --> 18:20.838
<i>Know what? You better come home
a winner, then.</i>

18:20.882 --> 18:22.536
<i>Huh? Love you.</i>

18:22.579 --> 18:23.885
All right, love you.

18:23.928 --> 18:25.930
See ya.

18:28.455 --> 18:33.503

18:35.418 --> 18:36.550

Ouch.

18:43.252 --> 18:46.386
Winning...
the snack haul challenge

18:46.429 --> 18:49.998
is gonna put me back
in the medal race, okay?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.782
Mm. You guys are so pretty.

18:51.826 --> 18:56.178
Ray asked me to help gather some
first-hand accounts of the op.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.788
Yeah?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.226
Doctor.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.271
Doctor.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.581
Brock is gonna run away
with this right now, okay?

19:07.624 --> 19:11.019
So stop trying to sabotage me,
Blondya Harding.

19:12.629 --> 19:15.980
This could help Jace realize
that he's the hero here,

19:16.024 --> 19:17.634
not the goat, okay?

19:17.678 --> 19:20.028
Hey, you need to... just,
can you please look that way?

19:20.071 --> 19:22.813
Listen to my voice
but look that way.

19:26.034 --> 19:29.168
- Okay, just, um...
- Ow.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.433
- Ow, ah, damn it.
- What do you remember? Start...

19:33.476 --> 19:35.522
start with
right after we breached, right?

19:35.565 --> 19:36.827
Um...

19:38.220 --> 19:39.830
We entered in the south end.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.745
It was Ray...

19:41.789 --> 19:42.920
Brock, myself.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.618
We started clearing rooms.

19:44.661 --> 19:48.448
The few guys that intel said
was gonna be there

19:48.491 --> 19:50.580
ended up being
a hell of a lot more.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.029
Should've set
your flux capacitor

20:05.073 --> 20:08.555
to three minutes ago,
Blondie McFly.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.906
<i>Then I got a visual
through the window, north wall,</i>

20:11.949 --> 20:13.995
<i>and to the left of it there was</i>

20:14.038 --> 20:17.216
<i>a Jihad Jerry
that was shouldering up an RPG.</i>

20:17.259 --> 20:20.654
RPG tango! North ridge.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.003
Keep hammering!

20:24.919 --> 20:26.921
Why would the enemy fire

20:26.964 --> 20:28.792
an RPG into his own safe house?

20:28.836 --> 20:30.533
Well, uh...

20:30.577 --> 20:31.882
some...

20:31.926 --> 20:34.842
dirtbag took a shit shot that...

20:34.885 --> 20:36.235
was probably aiming
somewhere else,

20:36.278 --> 20:37.540
ended up hitting something
in the building,

20:37.584 --> 20:38.889
and the whole damn thing
came down.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.717
But I tell you what,
I-I am grateful

20:40.761 --> 20:43.242
that Jace was outside
and saved our bacon bits.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.244
- Petty Officer Quinn?
- Whoa.

20:45.287 --> 20:48.986
- Time for your brain scan.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.597
That shouldn't take long.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.948
You keep your mitts
off my machine there.

20:55.819 --> 20:58.909
Hey, uh, look,
I'm just calling to tell you

20:58.953 --> 21:01.129
that I, uh,
I canceled the hotel

21:01.172 --> 21:02.783
in, uh, Rehoboth.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.306
I'll, uh...

21:04.350 --> 21:06.526
I'll call you
when I'm stateside.

21:07.483 --> 21:10.007
Everything okay?

21:10.051 --> 21:12.009
Yeah, just, uh...

21:12.053 --> 21:13.315
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:13.359 --> 21:16.144
What's this?

21:19.278 --> 21:21.845
- Nice haul, buddy!

21:21.889 --> 21:23.412
- Yeah!
- Real victory's

21:23.456 --> 21:25.153
stealing this stuff
behind Sonny's back.

21:25.196 --> 21:27.460
- I'll bet it was.
- It's mine now.

21:27.503 --> 21:29.331
- Hey.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.464
How's Trent? Is he awake yet?

21:31.507 --> 21:33.944
We put Petty Officer Sawyer
in the medically induced coma

21:33.988 --> 21:36.773
in hopes of reducing
the swelling on his brain.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.340
It hasn't worked.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.342
The danger we're monitoring
for now

21:40.386 --> 21:41.865
is an uncal herniation.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.693
That's when part of the brain
encroaches another part,

21:43.737 --> 21:47.436
causing neurological damage.
If we don't see improvement

21:47.480 --> 21:49.656
in the next 36 hours, we'll
have to perform a craniotomy

21:49.699 --> 21:51.005
to reduce the swelling.

22:04.932 --> 22:07.195
Trent's a fighter.

22:07.978 --> 22:10.590
I mean, he's got this.

22:10.633 --> 22:14.158
No, he shouldn't have
to be fighting. Mm-mm.

22:14.202 --> 22:15.812
If I made a different call...

22:15.856 --> 22:17.161
Jace...

22:17.205 --> 22:19.207
you might be the baddest
damn gunslinger alive,

22:19.250 --> 22:21.340
but as much as you think
you have a say

22:21.383 --> 22:24.647
in what happens downrange, war
has always got the last word.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.653
I could have done more.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.133
<i>We were outside.</i>

22:32.176 --> 22:33.656
<i>Trent was up front
on the heavy gun.</i>

22:33.700 --> 22:36.659
<i>And I went and I got
a few of the GIGN guys</i>

22:36.703 --> 22:38.835
<i>to bring back inside
to help you guys,</i>

22:38.879 --> 22:41.229
<i>and, uh,
we started to head back inside,</i>

22:41.272 --> 22:44.580
<i>and that's when Trent got hit
by an RPG.</i>

22:47.278 --> 22:49.193
Hold fire now!

22:49.237 --> 22:50.369
<i>You know, Trent was my priority.</i>

22:50.412 --> 22:52.501
<i>He was down, so I went to him.</i>

22:52.545 --> 22:56.244
<i>GIGN guys continued forward
without me.</i>

22:57.463 --> 23:00.074
Come on, man,
don't do this to me.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.815
Stay with me!

23:01.858 --> 23:03.556
I did everything I could
to help Trent,

23:03.599 --> 23:07.255
and then the RPG
took the building down.

23:08.299 --> 23:09.518
And thanks to you,

23:09.562 --> 23:11.651
me and Spenser
are standing here.

23:11.694 --> 23:14.001
What happened
after the building collapsed?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.829
GIGN guys...

23:15.872 --> 23:17.831
they moved back immediately.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.833
My instincts took over,

23:19.876 --> 23:21.225
<i>and I ran inside the building.</i>

23:21.269 --> 23:22.313
Ray!

23:22.357 --> 23:24.228
- Ray. Come on, get up.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.274
Put your arm around me.

23:26.317 --> 23:27.710
Ready?

23:27.754 --> 23:29.277
Come on.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.062
Hey. Hey, look at me.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.238
- Put your arm around me.

23:34.282 --> 23:36.937
Come on. Come on. Good?

23:40.941 --> 23:42.943
Come on, Brock. Come on.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.553
Get up, buddy.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.600
Okay.

23:47.643 --> 23:49.471
Hold on. Careful.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.444
Maybe you boys, you
could've handled your business.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.794
If I just had stayed
with Trent longer...

24:07.837 --> 24:10.753
Jace, did you fire the RPG
that brought down the building?

24:10.797 --> 24:12.059
Huh?

24:12.102 --> 24:14.104
Don't go blaming yourself
for an op

24:14.148 --> 24:16.367
that was a catch-22
from the start, man.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.457
Hey.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.286
You did your job, boss, okay?

24:22.330 --> 24:24.898
Look, let the doctors
just do theirs, all right?

24:24.941 --> 24:27.988
If I stayed with him
a little longer, maybe I...

24:36.997 --> 24:38.564
Hey.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.957
I cannot thank you enough
for reading this paper, sir.

24:41.001 --> 24:43.220
I-I... I'm sure you have
a lot of notes.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.267
Um, can I get you a drink
before we dig in?

24:46.310 --> 24:47.964
Well, this isn't
a drinking occasion.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.619
I wanted to meet here because
we cannot have this conversation

24:50.663 --> 24:51.794
at DEVGRU.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.492
Okay.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.624
You asked me to read a paper...

24:55.668 --> 24:57.670
about applying lessons
from Afghanistan

24:57.713 --> 25:00.629
to better protect warfighters
in Africa.

25:00.673 --> 25:01.761
What you gave me

25:01.804 --> 25:04.764
is a manifesto
with a flawed thesis.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.768
Uh, what's flawed is
our inability to adapt

25:08.811 --> 25:12.162
- to this endless war.
- You're an officer

25:12.206 --> 25:15.035
in the United States Navy,
and to label...

25:15.078 --> 25:18.560
major operations
as short-sighted,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.344
misguided...

25:20.388 --> 25:23.086
is revisionist history
that many of your superiors

25:23.130 --> 25:24.958
are gonna find
personally insulting,

25:25.001 --> 25:26.481
- including me.
- I was standing up

25:26.525 --> 25:27.917
for our warfighters.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.224
I was not taking shots
at the architects of these wars.

25:30.267 --> 25:33.140
This is the United States Navy.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.534
You think we do nuance here?

25:36.317 --> 25:39.233
I just gave you the opinion
of an officer.

25:39.276 --> 25:41.627
Here's the opinion of a friend.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.064
You publish this paper,

25:44.107 --> 25:47.502
you are gonna start a shitstorm
that you want no part of.

25:48.459 --> 25:51.593
Now, I know your intentions
are pure...

25:51.637 --> 25:54.291
but you are too good
of an officer

25:54.335 --> 25:58.208
to derail your career
over some paper.

26:02.343 --> 26:06.434
Ooh. How's the assignment
coming along?

26:06.477 --> 26:07.783
Feel like I'm rounding
third base.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.306
Good, good.

26:09.350 --> 26:10.917
- You...

26:12.353 --> 26:14.007
Damn it.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.924
Running into roadblocks
with Sam.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.666
One step forward,
two steps back.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.756
I been down that road
with Swanny.

26:23.799 --> 26:25.192
You know...

26:25.235 --> 26:27.107
you know, you think
you're making progress,

26:27.150 --> 26:29.631
and then reality just...

26:29.675 --> 26:31.894
gives you a cold shower.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.202
Sam's not even
in the damn V.A. system,

26:35.245 --> 26:37.639
because he doesn't have
a government-issued I.D.

26:37.683 --> 26:40.773
Naima was gonna take him down
to the DMV to get one,

26:40.816 --> 26:43.297
but he never showed.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.301
The legacy of the war on terror

26:47.344 --> 26:49.956
isn't on the battlefields
overseas.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.654
It's on our sidewalks at home.

26:57.703 --> 27:02.316
Hey, uh, don't forget to take
down your account, all right?

27:03.360 --> 27:06.146
Time for my brain scan.

27:13.022 --> 27:15.895
We made entry on the black side
of the building.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.723
I split from Bravo 1.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.463
<i>Ran a combat clearance.</i>

27:19.507 --> 27:21.465
<i>The plan was to meet up
with the rest of Bravo,</i>

27:21.509 --> 27:24.686
<i>but we got held up.</i>

27:24.730 --> 27:28.211
<i>Found a room
with an explosive hazard...</i>

27:30.257 --> 27:31.911
Mark it for EOD.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.695
<i>...so I tagged the door
with a red chem light,</i>

27:33.739 --> 27:36.959
<i>and as I made my way
to meet up with Jason</i>

27:37.003 --> 27:38.178
<i>and continue clearing,</i>

27:38.221 --> 27:40.180
we heard shooting break out

27:40.223 --> 27:41.703
on the other side of the target.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.922
<i>Bravo 4, I say again,</i>

27:42.965 --> 27:43.836
<i>I need four in. How copy?</i>

27:43.879 --> 27:45.359
Bravo 2, this is 1.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.795
Your comms aren't making it
outside the building.

27:46.839 --> 27:48.623
I'll head back outside
and get more shooters.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.972
Go to Ray.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.713
<i>Good copy.
Sooner the better.</i>

28:19.088 --> 28:21.351
This is the building.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.964
South end.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.401
Trucks.

28:27.444 --> 28:30.970
This represents
this one up here.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.754
Two rooms.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.591
<i>We entered the
south entrance of the building,</i>

28:43.634 --> 28:46.072
<i>split the train, and then
started clearing rooms north</i>

28:46.115 --> 28:48.117
<i>through the target.</i>

28:48.161 --> 28:51.207
So, split the rooms through
clear to the north.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.254
<i>Then I got a visual</i>

28:54.297 --> 28:56.343
<i>through the window,
north wall,</i>

28:56.386 --> 28:58.737
<i>and then to the left of it
there was a Jihad Jerry</i>

28:58.780 --> 29:02.001
<i>that was shouldering up
an RPG.</i>

29:12.838 --> 29:18.452
So, if the RPG was launched
from the rooftop here...

29:19.932 --> 29:24.588
...how does it detonate
on the ground floor here?

29:25.589 --> 29:27.330
It makes no sense.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.603
I just pulled off
the sock equivalent

29:39.647 --> 29:41.301
of the Lufthansa heist.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.608
The rest of Bravo
better watch out.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.969
Hey.

29:57.012 --> 30:00.102
You're still stewing, I see.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.670
Canceling those plans
to Rehoboth

30:02.713 --> 30:04.846
probably didn't help.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.761
You know, been grabbed
and poked and prodded

30:06.805 --> 30:09.329
for the past few days.
I've had enough. Had enough.

30:09.372 --> 30:12.114
- Stop.
- No, no, not stopping.

30:13.637 --> 30:14.856
Mandy shows up in town,

30:14.900 --> 30:15.988
and you get a hitch
in your giddyap

30:16.031 --> 30:17.119
for the first time in years?
Come on.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.338
Don't hold out on me,
brother-man.

30:18.381 --> 30:21.384
Tell me, uh...
tell me what's the deal?

30:21.428 --> 30:25.562
Me and her just been,
you know, heading up to

30:25.606 --> 30:28.565
Rehoboth every few weeks.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.786
That is nice to hear.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.007
I was hoping you two would
spend some time together.

30:35.050 --> 30:38.532
Time that took my eye
off of Bravo.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.101
Oh. I see.

30:42.144 --> 30:46.322
So, because you were hanging
with a girl you dig,

30:46.366 --> 30:48.934
that's what put Trent here?

30:50.283 --> 30:53.286
Stop looking for excuses to deny
yourself what you deserve.

30:57.029 --> 31:00.989
You know, Ray, you know,
I put in an honest effort

31:01.033 --> 31:05.428
allowing myself for once

31:05.472 --> 31:09.041
to have a life
outside of Bravo,

31:09.084 --> 31:11.652
- and yet here we are.
- An honest effort...

31:11.695 --> 31:15.569
...isn't keeping
the relationship

31:15.612 --> 31:18.920
in a Rehoboth Beach bubble
because you're afraid of...

31:18.964 --> 31:20.574
making it real.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.316
I can't believe it, man, you...

31:23.359 --> 31:26.493
The same guy who's willing
to repeatedly run into

31:26.536 --> 31:29.148
a collapsed building
to save his teammates

31:29.191 --> 31:31.672
is scared to move forward
with a girl he likes?

31:31.715 --> 31:34.936
It's not that easy, Ray.
You know, I thought I,

31:34.980 --> 31:37.112
I finally found balance,

31:37.156 --> 31:39.723
but then war put its
ugly thumb on the scale,

31:39.767 --> 31:41.900
so I should have known better.

31:44.728 --> 31:48.776
Jace, you ever think
that meeting Mandy

31:48.819 --> 31:50.647
was one of the few good things
that actually

31:50.691 --> 31:52.649
came out of this damn war?

31:52.693 --> 31:54.260
I mean, brother, you two
might actually have

31:54.303 --> 31:55.609
a future together.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.611
Mm. Yeah, I'll think
about that future

31:57.654 --> 32:01.397
once Trent is in the clear,
okay?

32:03.617 --> 32:05.924
- Okay.
- Yeah.

32:06.707 --> 32:08.709
You sure the RPG
came from the north?

32:08.752 --> 32:10.145
Yeah, that's what I saw.

32:10.189 --> 32:11.581
So, were there any EOD hazards

32:11.625 --> 32:13.496
on the west side
of the safe house?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.803
No, it was clear.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.328
Clear. So how did one RPG

32:19.372 --> 32:20.895
take down a whole building?

32:20.939 --> 32:24.116
There was a second shooter
on the grassy knoll.

32:24.159 --> 32:27.597
Maybe another RPG launcher?

32:29.338 --> 32:32.559
I mean, look, all I know is the
enemy knew that we were coming.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.126
They were armed to the tits.

32:34.169 --> 32:38.478
We're lucky to have survived
that Murphy's Law op.

32:38.521 --> 32:41.176
Yeah.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.830
- What is that?
- What?

32:42.873 --> 32:45.180
No, no, turn--
Look at me.

32:45.224 --> 32:48.357
- Are you wearing makeup?
- No.

32:48.401 --> 32:51.404
Yeah, well... well...

32:51.447 --> 32:54.885
I listened to you and Ray, okay,
about keeping radio silence

32:54.929 --> 32:57.062
with Hannah,
so I gave her a call.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.455
And then I sweet-talked
that nurse down there

32:59.499 --> 33:04.025
into helping me put my best
uninjured face forward.

33:04.069 --> 33:07.028
So instead of saying nothing,
you lied to her?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.769
Oh, come on, you of all people
know that lying is

33:08.812 --> 33:10.771
a necessary evil.
Come on, man.

33:10.814 --> 33:13.948
I was tempted to-to spare Stella
the stress

33:13.992 --> 33:15.558
of knowing that we're in here.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.908
Okay, but as much as I want
to believe that withholding

33:17.952 --> 33:19.823
is actually really
protecting her,

33:19.867 --> 33:22.087
that kind of thinking is how
my dad and Jason

33:22.130 --> 33:23.175
ended up being alone.

33:23.218 --> 33:26.439
Clay, I just got Leanne
full-time.

33:26.482 --> 33:28.136
Okay? I just got her.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.485
- Yeah.
- And there's

33:29.529 --> 33:31.618
no way in hell
I'm ever going back.

33:31.661 --> 33:34.403
And you got Hannah
in your life, too.

33:34.447 --> 33:37.537
Yeah, that's, that's what
I meant, Hannah-Hannah, too.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.627
Yeah. Is being,
being hospitalized

33:40.670 --> 33:43.021
all that you've been
hiding from her?

33:44.718 --> 33:46.937
You made a pretty quick
little transition there,

33:46.981 --> 33:49.984
going from writing in your diary
and pining over Lisa Davis

33:50.028 --> 33:51.464
to moving in
with your baby mama.

33:51.507 --> 33:52.813
Davis and I didn't have
a choice,

33:52.856 --> 33:54.336
and this time I do, okay.

33:54.380 --> 33:57.078
And being honest with Hannah
is courting disaster.

33:57.122 --> 34:00.821
It's like handing her
Pandora's Box and being like,

34:00.864 --> 34:02.997
"Hey, open it up."

34:03.041 --> 34:05.565
You know? I don't know.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.698
What in the hell is
happening there?

34:08.742 --> 34:11.049
Is he okay?

34:16.184 --> 34:18.578
Later, buddy.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.806
I don't envy the weight
of having to

34:29.850 --> 34:32.896
second-guess every call.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.858
Well, that's the burden
of being team leader.

34:37.901 --> 34:39.338
It's ops like these

34:39.381 --> 34:43.081
that make me reconsider
ever wanting to wear that crown.

34:45.431 --> 34:46.910
But that's why it's, you know,

34:46.954 --> 34:49.913
it's so important
that I learn as much as I can.

34:54.744 --> 34:57.443
Was there a...

34:57.486 --> 35:01.186
was there another RPG launcher
attacking from the east?

35:01.229 --> 35:03.797
Not that I saw.

35:10.412 --> 35:13.372
Hey, can you, um...

35:13.415 --> 35:17.593
can you fill me in on,
on what happened after we split?

35:20.814 --> 35:23.773
I was just-- I was wondering
why the GIGN guys

35:23.817 --> 35:25.558
never made entry
after you told them

35:25.601 --> 35:28.082
to join the fight inside.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.693
All right. Okay.

35:32.739 --> 35:34.654
- Um...

35:34.697 --> 35:36.177
we were clearing rooms.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.354
A firefight had broke out
inside.

35:39.398 --> 35:42.096
Ray called for more guns,

35:42.140 --> 35:44.968
but he couldn't get through.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.492
So, uh...

35:46.535 --> 35:50.539
<i>I broke outside and got some
of the GIGN guys</i>

35:50.583 --> 35:53.151
<i>to bring back into the fight.</i>

35:53.194 --> 35:55.849
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
come here!

35:55.892 --> 35:57.285
I need more guns inside.

35:57.329 --> 35:58.939
They're posted
at northeast corner.

35:58.982 --> 36:00.984
- You got it?
- We have a wall charge.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.638
Hey, good. Let's move.
It'll give us a clean entrance.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.466
Go, go, go!

36:12.996 --> 36:15.216
Put the breach
next to that door.

36:15.260 --> 36:18.219
- Go! Go!
- Got it.

36:19.568 --> 36:22.180
Hold fire now!

36:29.970 --> 36:32.233
Come on, man, don't do this
to me.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.148
Stay with me!

36:36.019 --> 36:40.067
GIGN guys used a wall charge
to breach?

36:40.110 --> 36:41.547
We would've walked right
into a firestorm

36:41.590 --> 36:44.376
if I used any
of the other entries.

36:47.640 --> 36:52.166
So... it was your call
to breach the wall,

36:52.210 --> 36:54.255
- not the French?
- My men inside.

36:54.299 --> 36:58.390
It's on me to make sure
they're out of the blast range.

37:00.783 --> 37:03.699
Which wall did you tell
GIGN to breach?

37:03.743 --> 37:05.005
East wall.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.660
Right next
to the corrugated door.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.096
Master Chief?

37:09.139 --> 37:12.317
Time for your daily brain scan.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.319
This is getting old.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.110
It's getting old.

37:45.393 --> 37:48.527
Hey. Clay is asking me questions
about the op,

37:48.570 --> 37:50.311
using his phone
to record things.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.226
What's he poking around about?

37:52.270 --> 37:54.315
Look, I-I just thought
that you pulling four guys

37:54.359 --> 37:56.317
out of a burning building
was worth some recognition,

37:56.361 --> 37:59.320
- that's all.
- I do not need any chest candy.

37:59.364 --> 38:01.322
- Look, Jace...
Excuse me, gentlemen.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.585
I have an update
on Petty Officer Sawyer.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.153
His brain swelling
has gone down.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.328
We'll bring him out of his coma

38:07.372 --> 38:08.373
- tomorrow morning.
- All right.

38:08.416 --> 38:10.592
Okay, that's good, all right?

38:10.636 --> 38:13.639
Look...
we on the same page here?

38:13.682 --> 38:15.858
The only good thing
I'm taking out of this op

38:15.902 --> 38:17.686
is that Trent's gonna be okay.

38:17.730 --> 38:18.861
Got it?

38:18.905 --> 38:22.256
We're on the same page, brother.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.258
All right.

38:28.915 --> 38:30.438
Yo.

38:30.482 --> 38:32.310
Trent's gonna be okay.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.702
That's good news.

38:33.746 --> 38:37.053
When, uh, when do we get to...
to see him?

38:37.097 --> 38:38.533
Tomorrow.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.841
Oh, and, uh,
your work is done.

38:41.884 --> 38:44.713
Jason, he, uh,
he sniffed out the...

38:44.757 --> 38:45.888
medal assignment.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.716
Put a bullet in it.

38:47.760 --> 38:50.415
So... that's it.

38:50.458 --> 38:52.765
Hey, uh, Ray, did your team see

38:52.808 --> 38:55.942
any EOD hazards when you guys
were clearing the west side?

38:55.985 --> 38:58.510
Like, anything that enemy RPG

38:58.553 --> 39:00.381
could have ignited and taken
the building down with?

39:00.425 --> 39:02.470
You have a funny way of dropping
the assignment, Clay.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.865
No, it's just, honestly,
it's for my own curiosity.

39:07.170 --> 39:08.911
Uh...

39:08.955 --> 39:10.348
no.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.262
We didn't find anything
on the west side.

39:12.306 --> 39:13.916
Now close the book on it.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.136
Yeah, consider it closed.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.443
All right.

39:37.636 --> 39:41.117
Petty Officer Sawyer,
I don't want to alarm you,

39:41.161 --> 39:44.773
but you've been in a coma
for ten years.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.917
You, uh...

40:00.876 --> 40:03.966
You had me there
for a second, yeah.

40:04.010 --> 40:06.142
Beard was a nice touch.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.623
You don't want to know
how we made that. Trust me.

40:08.667 --> 40:10.669
I wouldn't be getting
any of that in your mouth.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.453
- You got a couple strands

40:12.497 --> 40:13.802
coming in right there.

40:13.846 --> 40:14.977
You might want to pick
that glue off, too.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.066
Wait. Wait, wait.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.852
S-Something's wrong.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.595
I don't remember
you guys being so ugly.

40:25.466 --> 40:27.294
Sense of humor still intact.

40:27.337 --> 40:30.602
Uh, looks like you guys...

40:30.645 --> 40:33.735
took some hits
and checked in, too.

40:33.779 --> 40:36.608
Well, Bravo is now a unit
of the crutch brigade.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.827
No one's been sent to the brig?

40:40.350 --> 40:42.831
- I'm disappointed.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.486
We had a friendly competition
to pass the time.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.793
- Team shenanigans?
- Yeah.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.055
Who... who won?

40:49.098 --> 40:52.406
Okay, the winner?
Drumroll, guys.

40:53.799 --> 40:56.323
The winner is--
just because I quit--

40:56.366 --> 40:58.586
good old urban cowboy...

40:58.630 --> 41:00.588
- Brock Reynolds!

41:00.632 --> 41:02.503
Yeah!

41:02.547 --> 41:05.288
Look at that, huh?
Look at that guy.

41:05.332 --> 41:06.507
Stop the steal.

41:06.551 --> 41:07.769
- Stop the steal.
There it is.

41:07.813 --> 41:08.553
Hey, come on, man.

41:08.596 --> 41:09.815
Go enjoy that, guys.

41:09.858 --> 41:11.425
- Look at that.
- Yeah, look at it.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.557
- Smells like you, man.
- You gonna schedule

41:12.600 --> 41:13.906
a little time
at a hotel in Rehoboth

41:13.949 --> 41:15.473
- when you get back home?
Uh... you know,

41:15.516 --> 41:18.040
I'm thinking about something
a little bit closer to home

41:18.084 --> 41:20.434
- this time.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.044
Okay.

41:26.266 --> 41:28.094
Look, I thought I told, uh, Ray

41:28.137 --> 41:31.489
to bury the medal campaign
there, Lois Laine.

41:31.532 --> 41:35.493
Hey, did you warn the, uh, GIGN

41:35.536 --> 41:37.712
about any EOD hazards
in the building

41:37.756 --> 41:40.541
when you told them
where to put the wall charge?

41:42.369 --> 41:43.762
Why would I do that?

41:43.805 --> 41:47.113
There were no EOD hazards
in the building.

41:50.290 --> 41:51.944
Doc. Hey, there you are.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.423
Tell you what,
you ever need anyone to help you

41:53.467 --> 41:54.947
with the prostate exams...

41:54.990 --> 41:57.689
this kid, top-notch.

41:57.732 --> 42:00.605
Master Chief Hayes, a word?

42:01.606 --> 42:03.564
Yeah. Excuse me.

42:05.174 --> 42:08.221
Tell you what, Doc, if the
military's looking to clone me,

42:08.264 --> 42:11.006
I pass.

42:11.050 --> 42:12.747
I'd like to run some more tests.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.750
For what? I've been discharged.

42:15.794 --> 42:18.840
Daily CT scans we've been doing
was an acute response

42:18.884 --> 42:20.886
to the injuries
you came in with.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.409
And they all checked out,
so I'm good to go.

42:22.452 --> 42:25.107
But raised enough flags
for me to look over your record.

42:25.151 --> 42:27.283
20 years operating.

42:27.327 --> 42:29.285
Multiple documented concussions.

42:29.329 --> 42:32.506
Exposure to more hard combat
than anyone I've come across.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.248
You're a prime candidate
for Breacher's Syndrome.

42:35.291 --> 42:36.902
So is every other frogman.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.468
You understand? All right?

42:38.512 --> 42:40.949
I have been cleared to leave,
so I'm leaving.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.951
TBI is an invisible injury.

42:42.995 --> 42:45.737
Which is why
I recommend scheduling

42:45.780 --> 42:49.088
diffusion tensor imaging
to detect precursors

42:49.131 --> 42:51.699
to astroglial scarring.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.660
Have you experienced headaches?

42:55.703 --> 42:57.662
Hearing disturbances?

42:57.705 --> 42:59.664
Trouble concentrating?

42:59.707 --> 43:02.449
Irritable more than usual?

43:02.492 --> 43:05.365
- Not till you showed up, Doc.

43:05.408 --> 43:07.497
How about memory problems?

43:14.287 --> 43:15.680
<i>And how did one RPG
bring down the whole building?</i>

43:15.723 --> 43:17.638
<i>I was inside.
I didn't have a line of sight...</i>

43:17.682 --> 43:19.248
<i>Found a room
with an explosive hazard.</i>

43:19.292 --> 43:21.642
<i>Mark it for EOD.
RPG tango!</i>

43:21.686 --> 43:23.644
<i>GIGN guys used
a wall charge to breach?</i>

43:23.688 --> 43:26.560
<i>East wall. Right next
to the corrugated door.</i>

43:27.387 --> 43:29.345
<i>I asked</i>

43:29.389 --> 43:30.912
if you have memory problems.

43:30.956 --> 43:33.654
My men put me up for a medal
for this op, all right?

43:33.698 --> 43:35.656
Just to show I have no chinks
in my armor.

43:35.700 --> 43:38.180
That's what's so horrific
about TBI.

43:38.224 --> 43:42.010
Most of the time the injured
show no signs of impairment.

43:42.054 --> 43:44.926
But in an instant,
that can change.

43:44.970 --> 43:47.363
Proper scans to gauge whether
you're suffering from TBI--

43:47.407 --> 43:49.365
I encourage you to look now,

43:49.409 --> 43:51.672
so you can make
informed decisions

43:51.716 --> 43:54.762
before the effects
become disastrous.

44:21.876 --> 44:24.618
<i>Did you warn the, uh, GIGN</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:26.794
<i>about any EOD hazards
in the building</i>

44:26.838 --> 44:29.405
<i>when you told them
where to put the wall charge?</i>

44:29.449 --> 44:30.929
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

44:30.972 --> 44:33.932
<i>There were no EOD hazards
in the building.</i>

44:43.463 --> 44:45.421
Put the breach

44:45.465 --> 44:47.946
next to that door. Go!

44:47.989 --> 44:49.338
<i>Go!</i>

44:50.905 --> 44:53.386
<i>Which wall
did you tell GIGN to breach?</i>

44:53.429 --> 44:54.953
<i>East wall.</i>

44:54.996 --> 44:57.956
<i>Right next
to the corrugated door.</i>

45:04.397 --> 45:07.487
Jason brought the building down.

45:58.668 --> 46:01.889
Both of you look like
you've seen a ghost.

46:02.716 --> 46:04.196
I'm fine.

46:11.072 --> 46:13.205
Easy day.

46:14.380 --> 46:15.816
Easy day.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.080
- Let's go home.
- Best thing

46:19.124 --> 46:20.690
I've heard all day, Ray.

46:21.517 --> 46:24.042
♪ <i>Don't laugh too loud</i>♪

46:24.085 --> 46:26.000
♪ <i>When people say</i>♪

46:26.044 --> 46:30.613
♪ <i>Someone could steal
your love away♪</i>

46:30.657 --> 46:34.792

to you.♪</i>
