00:07.100 --> 00:08.000
         Good morning.          

00:08.100 --> 00:08.800
            Morning.            

00:10.900 --> 00:11.800
What's with the vegetables?     

00:11.900 --> 00:13.200
              Same as always--  

00:13.200 --> 00:14.200
            they're watching TV.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.500
  Sam, I have changed my diet.  

00:17.600 --> 00:21.100
    I'm finally eating right    
for the first time in 30 years. 

00:21.200 --> 00:23.500
            30? What were you   
             doing the other 12?

00:25.900 --> 00:27.400
    And I feel so good          
         that I thought         

00:27.500 --> 00:28.800
 we can all work on our diets.  

00:28.900 --> 00:30.400
        So I'm making up        
  this little vegetable plate.  

00:30.400 --> 00:32.400
And I figure if those guys      
 are gonna sit around and eat,  

00:32.500 --> 00:34.700
    they might as well          
     eat something healthy.     

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
         I don't think          
    they're gonna like this.    

00:35.900 --> 00:37.000
 Oh, they'll never even notice. 

00:45.800 --> 00:47.900
         What the hell is this?!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
            What's wrong?       

00:49.000 --> 00:51.700
              This <i>thing</i> I found
            in the pretzel bowl.

00:51.700 --> 00:53.200
                Oh, my God,     
                 what are these?

00:53.300 --> 00:55.600
    They appear to be orange    
    and green sticks.           

00:55.700 --> 00:58.100
                          CLIFF:
        I know what they are.   
              You know, when you

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
go in a restaurant              

00:59.300 --> 01:01.100
and you order a nice,           
big, thick, juicy steak         

01:01.200 --> 01:03.500
and they put this other         
stuff on the plate              
that you shove aside?           

01:03.500 --> 01:04.700
    Oh, you mean vegetables?    

01:04.800 --> 01:06.200
                      They can't
                  be vegetables.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.400
              There's no batter.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.600
        You guys,               

01:09.600 --> 01:10.900
you're not even                 
giving me a chance.             

01:10.900 --> 01:11.900
Now, you sit around             

01:11.900 --> 01:13.400
and you stuff your faces        
all day long,                   

01:13.500 --> 01:14.600
so why don't you stuff them     

01:14.700 --> 01:15.900
with something                  
that's good for you?            

01:15.900 --> 01:17.300
    Go ahead. Try it.           

01:23.400 --> 01:24.600
Yeah, it's not bad.             

01:24.700 --> 01:25.800
                Yeah. No, try   
                the cauliflower.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.000
        It acts like a ladle.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.000
          Whoa! Sammy.          

02:47.000 --> 02:49.200
        I see her.              

02:49.400 --> 02:50.600
             How do you do that?

02:50.700 --> 02:53.000
I could tell you, but then      
  I'd have to kill you, Norm.   

02:54.400 --> 02:56.100
     Excuse me. Excuse me. Uh...

02:56.200 --> 02:57.500
             Come over here for 
             a second, will you?

02:57.600 --> 02:59.400
              I want to pour you
        a glass of champagne.   

02:59.500 --> 03:00.900
            Interesting thing   
              about this bottle:

03:00.900 --> 03:02.200
          it was presented to me

03:02.300 --> 03:06.000
        for being the hottest   
        single guy in Boston,   

03:06.000 --> 03:08.500
        but, you know, until you
    walked through that door,   

03:08.500 --> 03:11.000
    I have never found anyone   
      I wanted to share it with.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.700
    I don't drink champagne.    

03:12.800 --> 03:13.600
                     Thanks.    

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
        Whoo! What just         
      happened here, guys?      

03:19.000 --> 03:20.200
                Well, you got   
                 shot down, Sam.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.400
     Uh, you know, you read     

03:21.400 --> 03:22.800
about those kind of things      

03:22.800 --> 03:24.600
      but you never think       
  they're gonna happen to <i>you.</i>  

03:24.700 --> 03:25.900
                        NORM:   
                 Well, you know,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.700
                 maybe she's    
            seeing someone else.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.700
          I don't see           
      how that's relevant.      

03:29.800 --> 03:32.500
You know, Sammy, maybe          
she's one of these women        

03:32.600 --> 03:35.100
who, uh, coaches basketball     
and does her own carpentry,     

03:35.200 --> 03:37.100
if you know what I mean.        

03:37.200 --> 03:38.900
      Let's go with that,       
      shall we, gentlemen?      

03:40.200 --> 03:41.900
        Afternoon, all.         

03:41.900 --> 03:43.900
Hey, how's it going, Dr. Crane? 

03:44.000 --> 03:47.100
Oh, the usual. The crying,      
the tantrums, the bed-wetting.  

03:47.100 --> 03:49.200
                    Yeah. That's
                    fatherhood. 

03:49.300 --> 03:51.500
  No, that's my therapy group.  

03:51.600 --> 03:55.100
    What a bunch of losers.     

03:55.200 --> 03:57.300
    And I'm sorry. You know,    
 I'm just a bit stressed today. 

03:57.400 --> 04:00.100
 Lilith and I have been looking 
 for a preschool for Frederick. 

04:00.100 --> 04:03.100
Tomorrow we've got an interview 
    with the administrators     

04:03.200 --> 04:06.000
    of the Magic Hours          
        Learning Center.        

04:06.100 --> 04:07.300
                You know, I     
                 don't get that.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.100
            Now, this is your   
            kid, your money--   

04:09.200 --> 04:11.900
                why aren't <i>you</i>  
              interviewing <i>them?</i>

04:12.000 --> 04:14.200
        Well, the beauty        
of private education, Sam,      

04:14.300 --> 04:16.800
is that they're able to weed out
the unacceptable lowlifes.      

04:16.899 --> 04:19.700
I just pray I'm not one of them.

04:19.700 --> 04:22.100
                Wa-wa-wa-wa-wait
                 a second here. 

04:22.200 --> 04:24.800
        Uh, what's the matter   
        with public school?     

04:24.900 --> 04:27.300
        I went to public school.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.100
    I love you, Cliff.          

04:32.100 --> 04:33.100
    Don't ever change.          

04:35.400 --> 04:39.500
  Until I began eating clean,   
I never realized how good       

04:39.600 --> 04:43.300
        a nice, dry rice cake   
                    could taste.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.800
How can you eat                 
those, Miss Howe?               

04:44.900 --> 04:46.800
They don't have                 
any flavor.                     
                      Oh.       

04:46.800 --> 04:49.500
            If I eat these, I   
            will live longer.   

04:49.600 --> 04:51.000
Well, I have a question.        

04:51.100 --> 04:52.000
You know how                    
you're always talking           

04:52.100 --> 04:53.000
 about how you hate your life?  

04:53.100 --> 04:54.400
    How come you want           
    to make it longer?          

04:54.400 --> 04:55.800
                 Shut up, Woody.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.900
        Hello, Frasier.         

05:02.300 --> 05:03.600
            Darling.            

05:03.700 --> 05:05.500
                What's wrong?   
             You look so somber.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.000
How can you tell?               

05:08.400 --> 05:10.000
  I took a shot and got lucky.  

05:14.200 --> 05:17.500
Frasier, I have some bad news.  

05:17.500 --> 05:20.400
This morning-- at 9:00--        

05:20.500 --> 05:22.200
Whitey passed away.             

05:22.300 --> 05:23.300
                     Oh, Lilith.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.100
              Oh.               

05:24.300 --> 05:25.100
CRANE:                          
I'm so sorry.                   

05:25.300 --> 05:28.500
Just yesterday, he was          
so young, so vital.             

05:28.600 --> 05:30.400
     This morning               
I walked into the lab           

05:30.400 --> 05:34.500
and found him facedown in       
his nest of cedar shavings.     

05:34.600 --> 05:35.100
                      Excuse me?

05:35.300 --> 05:37.200
            You see, Whitey     

05:37.200 --> 05:38.500
        was Lilith's senior,    

05:38.600 --> 05:40.200
          and most cherished,   
                lab rat.        

05:40.200 --> 05:41.600
            Aw, gee!            

05:41.600 --> 05:43.500
          (grumbling)           

05:43.600 --> 05:45.300
No, you don't understand.       

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
Usually we don't get            
attached to the rats,           

05:47.600 --> 05:49.500
but this one was so special.    

05:49.600 --> 05:51.000
  We even named him.            

05:51.100 --> 05:53.500
  Everyone in the lab           
  called him Whitey.            

05:53.600 --> 05:58.800
Are you sure they               
weren't talking to you?         

05:58.900 --> 06:01.700
    No, Carla. They were talking
        about Whitey the rat.   

06:01.800 --> 06:03.100
Okay, I'll ask again.           

06:03.200 --> 06:05.600
Are you sure they               
weren't talking to you?         

06:05.600 --> 06:07.700
Carla, please!                  

06:07.700 --> 06:09.500
Lilith is mourning the          
loss of a close friend.         

06:09.600 --> 06:10.500
            What's the big deal?

06:10.600 --> 06:11.700
         You go find another rat

06:11.700 --> 06:13.400
                to hook up to   
                your electrodes.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.500
My research never harmed Whitey 
          in any way.           

06:17.500 --> 06:20.300
        In fact, he had         
  everything a rat could want.  

06:20.400 --> 06:22.700
  If he needed it,              
  I gave it to him.             

06:24.300 --> 06:26.400
That rat was the envy of others.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.500
 You know, that's true,         
but I got over it.              

06:31.500 --> 06:34.000
    I miss him so much.         

06:34.100 --> 06:37.400
         (sobs)                 

06:37.500 --> 06:39.200
Let it out, darling.            

06:39.300 --> 06:40.500
         I am.                  

06:43.800 --> 06:46.700
     Ooh... Here she comes.     

06:46.800 --> 06:49.000
 Ho-ho. I'm psyched this time.  
          I'm psyched.          

06:51.000 --> 06:52.200
Hi. Listen, excuse me           
for just a second here.         

06:52.300 --> 06:53.600
I, I didn't mean                
to, you know, imply             

06:53.700 --> 06:56.500
that I was gonna give you       
the champagne to get you drunk. 

06:56.600 --> 06:58.400
I just wanted to...             
get to know you.                

06:58.500 --> 07:00.900
              You'd have to get 
              me drunk for that.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.500
                            Ooh!

07:04.500 --> 07:06.400
     First that other girl,     
      now her twin sister.      

07:08.700 --> 07:10.500
I don't know what she's         
looking for in life,            

07:10.500 --> 07:12.100
     but, well, if she          
     can't find it here,        

07:12.200 --> 07:13.800
        she's not gonna         
    find it anywhere.           

07:14.600 --> 07:16.100
        Paul! You ready?        

07:16.100 --> 07:17.400
        Yeah, let's go.         

07:19.700 --> 07:21.200
             Paul?              

07:22.900 --> 07:24.000
See you later, guys.            

07:24.100 --> 07:25.300
      Don't wait up.            

07:30.900 --> 07:32.200
      You know, this isn't      
    really happening.           

07:32.300 --> 07:33.300
        No, no, no, no.         

07:33.400 --> 07:35.500
    In a few seconds,           
    I'm gonna wake up           

07:35.600 --> 07:37.200
in my own bed covered in sweat. 

07:42.600 --> 07:44.200
    Okay, here we go.           

07:44.200 --> 07:46.200
    Ooh, this is gonna          
         be a long one.         

07:51.600 --> 07:52.700
         I feel great.          

07:52.800 --> 07:54.700
     I've been eating clean     
        for 12 hours now        

07:54.800 --> 07:57.000
     and I feel like I have     
    a whole new body.           

07:57.100 --> 07:58.100
 I have more energy,            

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
and I-I just feel better.       

07:59.200 --> 08:01.200
I'm a celebration of life.      

08:01.200 --> 08:02.400
         Boy, I'll say, Rebecca,

08:02.500 --> 08:04.300
            and what goes better
             with a celebration 

08:04.400 --> 08:06.100
                than... Ho-Hos? 

08:07.500 --> 08:09.800
Well... Well, Norm,             
I-I can't think                 

08:09.800 --> 08:13.800
of anything except,             
maybe... Twinkies.              

08:13.900 --> 08:16.100
        Gentlemen,              
    I have one word for you:    

08:16.100 --> 08:17.200
        Snowballs.              

08:18.500 --> 08:20.400
             Snowballs!         
                      Snowballs!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.700
Snowballs are better            
because they're bite-size.      

08:31.000 --> 08:32.100
            Good evening, all.  

08:34.200 --> 08:36.100
     Sam, Glenlivet rocks.      

08:36.200 --> 08:38.299
Two.                            
        How you feeling         
         there, Lilith?         

08:38.400 --> 08:40.100
Life goes on, Sam.              

08:40.200 --> 08:42.100
     Ah, that's the spirit.     

08:42.200 --> 08:44.400
Rather than brood and mourn,    

08:44.400 --> 08:46.300
Frasier and I have              
decided to do something         

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
a little bit more               
life-affirming.                 

08:48.200 --> 08:52.200
We're going to a theater        
and a late dinner.              

08:52.200 --> 08:54.300
I think Whitey                  
would approve.                  

08:54.300 --> 08:55.500
REBECCA:                        
Lilith, your clinic's           

08:55.600 --> 08:56.600
 on the phone. I think there's  

08:56.600 --> 08:58.000
          an emergency          
with one of your patients.      

08:58.100 --> 08:59.200
                     You can use
                     the phone  

08:59.200 --> 09:00.500
             in my office.      
Thank you.                      

09:00.600 --> 09:01.900
    Well, we-we've got          
        an 8:00 curtain.        

09:02.000 --> 09:04.400
Tell them to take two Thorazine 
  and call you in the morning.  

09:07.300 --> 09:08.500
            That'll be $7.50,   
                      Dr. Crane.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.400
Oh, yes, of course.             

09:11.500 --> 09:13.600
Oh, gee, I-I've                 
only got big bills.             

09:13.700 --> 09:16.000
      Well, perhaps Lilith      
        has some change.        

09:16.000 --> 09:17.200
         Oh, dear God.          

09:17.300 --> 09:19.400
What? What is it?               

09:19.500 --> 09:21.300
    Lilith is carrying          
    a dead rat in her purse.    

09:21.300 --> 09:23.200
                    Oh.         

09:24.700 --> 09:27.500
Why would she be carrying       
    a dead rat in her purse?    

09:27.600 --> 09:28.400
              Just a wild guess.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.800
                     A snack?   

09:34.900 --> 09:36.800
  This is not healthy at all.   

09:36.900 --> 09:39.000
        My wife has gone        
  completely around the bend.   

09:39.100 --> 09:41.300
      Perhaps I rushed her      
  through the grieving process  

09:41.400 --> 09:44.600
              too quickly. Oh...
             Oh, the poor woman.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.700
              I dare you to look
                in the purse.   

09:47.700 --> 09:50.100
Ha! Dare me? Dare you.          

09:51.500 --> 09:54.300
      You know, obviously,      
 I've got to dispose of Whitey  

09:54.400 --> 09:55.600
      break this fixation,      

09:55.600 --> 09:57.400
then deal with the repercussions
         as they occur.         

09:58.900 --> 10:00.700
         Eww.                   
                        Eww.    

10:02.200 --> 10:03.700
Yeah, I looked first.           

10:03.800 --> 10:05.300
    I bet you won't kiss him.   

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
    You two are sick!           

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
             Oh, yeah. We've got
            a big problem.      

10:11.600 --> 10:13.100
Obviously, Lilith               
is having trouble               

10:13.100 --> 10:14.600
breaking this attachment        
on her own.                     

10:14.600 --> 10:15.700
     I've got to be the man     

10:15.800 --> 10:17.600
        and handle this         
      in a mature fashion.      

10:21.100 --> 10:23.900
    Eww, eww, eww, eww! Eww!    

10:27.000 --> 10:28.200
    Is everything all right?    

10:28.300 --> 10:30.100
      Yes, it was a false alarm.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.700
        So nothing was wrong?   

10:31.800 --> 10:34.700
No. One of my patients          
set off a false alarm,          

10:34.800 --> 10:37.700
but he's a pyromaniac, so,      
for him, this is progress.      

10:39.000 --> 10:40.300
Oh, Lilith, darling. Hello.     

10:40.400 --> 10:41.800
I've, I've got your purse.      

10:41.900 --> 10:44.700
Uh, you know, we don't have time
for our drinks, really.         

10:44.800 --> 10:46.500
    Uh, th-the curtain's        
    in 45 minutes               

10:46.600 --> 10:48.200
    and you know                
  how I hate to be late.        

10:48.200 --> 10:50.400
        Yes. It's one of your   
     more endearing compulsions.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.900
        Uh, by the way, uh...   

10:51.900 --> 10:53.200
             there's something  
             we need to discuss.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.400
            You did what?!      

10:58.500 --> 11:00.200
         Darling, I did         
    what I had to do!           

11:00.300 --> 11:01.800
        Shut up! Where is he?   

11:03.200 --> 11:04.000
     (trash cans rattling)      

11:12.200 --> 11:14.800
          Apparently,           
     she's still grieving!      

11:24.000 --> 11:28.100
Well, 26 hours of eating clean. 

11:28.200 --> 11:30.300
                    And 26 hours
            of hearing about it.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.500
    Oh, good morning there.     
      Did you sleep okay?       

11:39.000 --> 11:41.700
              Not too well, Sam.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.500
      You know, I'd have thought
                that that couch,

11:44.500 --> 11:47.800
        after all the acrobatics
        you've done on it, would
        have a little more give.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.200
                But I appreciate
            your hospitality.   

11:52.200 --> 11:53.900
Anytime, Fras.                  

11:53.900 --> 11:56.800
    You know, I guess           
  I ought to freshen up, huh?   

11:56.900 --> 11:58.200
This is what it's come to.      

11:58.300 --> 11:59.600
     Bedding down in a bar,     

11:59.700 --> 12:01.900
    wearing the same clothes    
     for two days in a row.     

12:01.900 --> 12:03.200
                     Yeah, well,
                the trick, Fras,

12:03.300 --> 12:05.700
                 is to take your
    sport coat off like that.   
        Yeah?                   

12:05.800 --> 12:07.500
        and stand directly under
    the air conditioning duct   

12:07.500 --> 12:08.700
                for about, uh...
                    ten minutes.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.400
                Take it from me,
                 if you do that,

12:10.400 --> 12:12.200
              you can go another
            couple days easy.   

12:12.200 --> 12:16.300
         Are you saying         
     that you sometimes go      

12:16.400 --> 12:18.600
    for days at a time          
      in the same clothes?      

12:18.700 --> 12:20.600
        Oh, yeah, you get a look
             that works for you,

12:20.700 --> 12:22.100
              you stick with it.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.800
    (laughing):                 
    Oh, Paul.                   

12:32.300 --> 12:34.300
      Why is she laughing?      

12:34.400 --> 12:36.500
    Paul's not funny.           

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
    (laughing)                  

12:38.300 --> 12:40.400
Does anyone know what           
Paul does for a living?         

12:40.500 --> 12:42.200
After all, women are            
attracted to power.             

12:42.300 --> 12:44.600
                Uh, I think he's
          a tollbooth attendant.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.900
        Yep, well, that would   
    explain the quarter tips.   

12:50.500 --> 12:51.900
I think I know what it is.      

12:52.000 --> 12:54.300
     Paul's a real nice guy     
      and a good listener.      

12:54.400 --> 12:56.100
He probably shows               
a genuine interest              

12:56.200 --> 12:58.000
in who she is                   
as a person.                    

12:58.100 --> 13:00.800
Probably treats her             
with respect.                   

13:00.900 --> 13:03.900
    Well, if that's the case,   
            he's welcome to her.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.300
  Well, is there anything here  
I can have for breakfast?       

13:09.300 --> 13:11.700
If you'd like something         
that's tasty and nutritious,    

13:11.800 --> 13:13.700
you could spread                
some of this,                   

13:13.900 --> 13:16.800
     uh, bean curd on these     
fiber-rich bran crackers.       

13:16.900 --> 13:19.900
     I won't eat that crap.     

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Frasier, you're a doctor.       

13:21.000 --> 13:22.600
    You should believe          
    in health and nutrition.    

13:22.700 --> 13:24.000
 Doesn't mean I have to listen  

13:24.100 --> 13:26.900
     to some tree-hugging,      
      dirt-munching Druid.      

13:29.800 --> 13:31.000
    I'm sorry.                  

13:31.100 --> 13:34.100
I'm not exactly what            
you'd call a morning person.    

13:34.100 --> 13:35.700
  Dr. Crane, your wife called.  
I didn't want to wake you.      

13:35.800 --> 13:38.500
  Oh. She called to apologize?  

13:38.500 --> 13:39.800
         Well, sort of.         

13:39.900 --> 13:41.700
Uh, she said for you to meet her
     at Frederick's school.     

13:41.800 --> 13:42.900
You have that interview.        

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
        Oh, I completely forgot.
      Well, she also said       

13:45.200 --> 13:46.900
          to tell you           
     she knew you'd forget      

13:47.000 --> 13:48.700
      because "you're such      
    an uncaring human being.    

13:48.800 --> 13:49.800
                "But for once   

13:49.900 --> 13:51.900
         "in your life,         
      think of your child,      

13:52.000 --> 13:53.100
 "comb your few remaining hairs 

13:53.100 --> 13:55.000
"and wash that canned ham       
        you call a face         

13:55.100 --> 13:56.500
            and get over there."

13:58.500 --> 14:00.900
You know, now that I reread this

14:01.000 --> 14:03.300
    it sounds less and less     
        like an apology.        

14:04.800 --> 14:07.200
    Say, uh, Sammy, could I have
             a couple of coffees

14:07.300 --> 14:09.100
    for me and Paula?           

14:09.200 --> 14:11.300
    Paul and Paula?             

14:11.400 --> 14:13.000
            Yeah.               

14:13.100 --> 14:14.600
    Hey, Paul?                  

14:14.700 --> 14:16.500
             What?              

14:16.600 --> 14:18.200
         No, the song, you know,
                    "Hey, Paul."

14:18.300 --> 14:20.000
    Hey, what?                  

14:20.100 --> 14:21.400
CLIFF:                          
No, wait a minute.              

14:21.400 --> 14:24.700
You never heard of that old     
song, "Hey, hey, Paul?"         

14:24.700 --> 14:27.200
         Hey, hey, shut up.     

14:27.200 --> 14:29.400
            No, no, no, come on.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.600
             We're talking about
         that song from the '60s

14:31.600 --> 14:33.700
              by Paul and Paula,
              "Hey, hey, Paula."

14:33.800 --> 14:34.500
             What?              

14:34.700 --> 14:35.900
Nothing. Never mind.            

14:36.000 --> 14:37.400
Forget I brought it up.         

14:39.200 --> 14:41.500
Hey, this has been              
driving me crazy.               

14:41.600 --> 14:43.500
I gotta know                    
something here, Paul.           

14:43.500 --> 14:44.700
            What, Sam?          

14:44.800 --> 14:47.000
Well, I'll try to put this      
    as delicately as I can,     

14:47.100 --> 14:48.600
    because you're my friend    
        and I like you,         

14:48.700 --> 14:50.300
and I don't want to insult you, 

14:50.400 --> 14:52.800
     but why would any girl     
    be caught dead with you     

14:52.800 --> 14:54.600
when she could be with me?      

14:54.600 --> 14:58.400
                You thought that
                would offend me?

14:58.400 --> 15:00.100
          I'm serious.          

15:00.100 --> 15:03.300
  I mean, what'd you do, slip   
her a mickey or something?      

15:03.400 --> 15:06.200
      Well since you asked me so
     nicely, Sam, I'll tell you.

15:06.300 --> 15:10.400
 Paula is what we like to refer 
     to as a chubby-chaser.     

15:10.500 --> 15:13.600
        You're kidding.         

15:13.600 --> 15:14.900
You mean, she likes             
to go out                       

15:15.000 --> 15:18.200
      with guys who are...      
         who are, uh...         

15:18.200 --> 15:19.800
                    Portly, Sam.
        The word is "portly."   

15:22.500 --> 15:24.300
    Did you hear that?          

15:24.400 --> 15:26.600
            She only goes out   
        with guys who are heavy.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.300
Well, you'd be                  
surprised, Sam.                 

15:29.300 --> 15:31.000
Women like the                  
oddest things.                  

15:31.100 --> 15:32.100
     Take me.                   

15:32.100 --> 15:33.400
         Yeah? What do you like?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.200
Nothing. Just take me.          

15:41.500 --> 15:43.600
SAM:                            
This is driving me crazy.       

15:43.600 --> 15:44.900
    I've gotta fin...           

15:45.000 --> 15:46.400
    Excuse me. Listen.          

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
Apparently, you've been,        
you know, shooting me down here 

15:48.500 --> 15:51.300
for the last couple of days     
because of the way I look.      

15:51.400 --> 15:52.100
              So?               

15:52.300 --> 15:53.600
I think it's unfair             

15:53.700 --> 15:55.700
    that you're not willing     
  to get to know the real me.   

15:55.700 --> 15:57.500
I think if you did, we could be 
      really good friends.      

15:57.600 --> 15:59.400
    You want to be friends?     

15:59.500 --> 16:00.900
          Yeah, I do.           
                        Yeah?   

16:01.000 --> 16:03.500
            Okay, well, maybe   
                  we could start

16:03.600 --> 16:06.500
        by you introducing me   
        to some of your friends.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.800
    Especially that large and   
    lovely one right over there.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.300
    You mean Norm?              

16:24.300 --> 16:27.700
        Yeah. He's a suitful,   
                    isn't he?   

16:34.000 --> 16:35.500
         Oh, thank God.         

16:35.600 --> 16:37.400
         I didn't miss          
     the interview, did I?      

16:37.400 --> 16:39.600
         Yes, you did.          
      I've already had it.      

16:39.700 --> 16:42.900
                 They're outside
        conferring about us now.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.300
     What did you tell them     
        about me?               

16:45.300 --> 16:46.800
        I described you in terms

16:46.900 --> 16:48.000
        which were positively   
                        glowing,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.500
    which is the way I'd like   
             to see you in hell.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.300
                So just remember

16:53.300 --> 16:56.600
          when they come back in
                 to pretend that
             we love each other.

16:56.700 --> 16:58.900
          After that, I go right
        back to loathing you.   

16:59.000 --> 17:02.300
I can't believe that you're     
willing to destroy our marriage 

17:02.400 --> 17:03.500
all because of                  
your childish refusal           

17:03.600 --> 17:05.200
to accept the death             
of an animal.                   

17:05.300 --> 17:08.700
    The very fact that you think
        of Whitey as "an animal"

17:08.800 --> 17:11.500
              proves that we are
        completely incompatible.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.099
     But he was an animal!      

17:14.099 --> 17:15.800
  Well, what-what-what was he?  

17:15.900 --> 17:17.500
A... a... a vegetable?          
A mineral?                      

17:17.599 --> 17:21.099
Oh, I know, he was the          
CEO of General Motors.          

17:21.200 --> 17:23.900
                    I hate you. 

17:24.000 --> 17:25.700
          I hate you!           

17:25.800 --> 17:26.599
                Hello.          
        Hello.                  

17:26.700 --> 17:28.300
             This is my husband,

17:28.500 --> 17:30.600
              Dr. Frasier Crane.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.100
He's very sorry he's late,      

17:32.200 --> 17:34.000
but he's always so              
busy helping people.            

17:34.100 --> 17:36.100
            Pleased to meet you.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.600
             Won't you sit down?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.400
                And we'd like   
                    to thank you

17:39.400 --> 17:41.800
             for taking the time
              to come down here.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.900
        It's good to see parents
              that care so much.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.200
             You know, a program

17:46.300 --> 17:50.900
      like ours requires as much
    of the parents as the child.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.200
We couldn't agree more.         

17:52.300 --> 17:53.300
Right, dear?                    

17:53.300 --> 17:54.800
        Oh, absolutely, dear.   

17:54.900 --> 17:57.500
Unofficially, I think it's      
a very good possibility         

17:57.500 --> 17:59.200
that we'll be able              
to welcome Frederick            

17:59.300 --> 18:00.700
to the Magic Hours              
Learning Center.                

18:00.700 --> 18:03.200
      Oh, that's wonderful news.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.000
We couldn't be happier.         

18:05.100 --> 18:06.500
          But before you leave--

18:06.600 --> 18:08.900
        would you like to see   
             something precious?

18:09.000 --> 18:10.600
                      Our Sylvia

18:10.600 --> 18:12.300
                just had babies.

18:12.400 --> 18:14.600
             Well, who's Sylvia?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.800
The school's pet hamster.       

18:16.900 --> 18:18.100
        Oh.                     

18:22.500 --> 18:25.800
  Oh, look at that little one   
         in the corner.         

18:25.900 --> 18:27.800
He looks just like Whitey.      

18:27.900 --> 18:29.400
                Who's Whitey?   

18:29.400 --> 18:32.300
     Oh, he was my favorite     
            dead rat            

18:32.300 --> 18:35.600
     that this bastard took     
    and threw in the trash!     

18:35.700 --> 18:38.100
        Don't mind her.         

18:38.200 --> 18:39.900
She's just overemotional,       

18:40.000 --> 18:41.500
and crazy as a loon!            

18:41.500 --> 18:43.600
      I suppose you'd like      
      to take one of these      

18:43.700 --> 18:45.800
          and throw it          
      in the garbage, too?      

18:45.900 --> 18:47.900
Here, why don't you just bite   
the heads off these birds       

18:48.000 --> 18:49.200
while you're at it,             

18:49.300 --> 18:50.400
        Dr. Death?              

18:53.200 --> 18:55.100
        I am not the one        
    who goes walking around     

18:55.100 --> 18:57.900
     with the decomposing corpse
        of a rat in my purse.   

18:58.000 --> 19:00.200
You're a hateful man.           

19:00.300 --> 19:03.600
         And you are a troubled,
                disturbed woman.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.900
    But a wonderful mother.     

19:09.800 --> 19:12.300
    Well, we'll get back to you.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.100
Well, Sam, I've done it.        

19:19.200 --> 19:20.300
    Blighted my child's hopes   

19:20.400 --> 19:23.800
 of ever getting an education,  

19:23.900 --> 19:27.200
      and probably ruined       
      my marriage as well.      

19:27.300 --> 19:29.100
    I think my life is over.    

19:29.200 --> 19:30.900
      Yeah, well, life is tough.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
         I just got shot down by
     a chick who likes fat guys.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.000
        Oh, Rebecca, do you have
any more of those rice cakes?   

19:41.100 --> 19:42.200
    Why?                        

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
        Well, you were right.   

19:43.300 --> 19:44.500
    They're the perfect food.   

19:44.500 --> 19:46.500
Yeah, what's the gag?           

19:46.600 --> 19:49.200
            No, I'm telling you,
             we've been enjoying
            them all day, right?

19:49.200 --> 19:50.100
            You bet.            

19:50.200 --> 19:51.100
    Really?                     
                    Yeah.       

19:51.200 --> 19:52.400
Well, that's neat.              

19:52.500 --> 19:54.300
I'm glad I could make you guys, 
you know, feel better.          

19:54.400 --> 19:57.300
Yeah, I've got a whole new bag  
of them right down here.        
                     Great.     

19:57.400 --> 20:00.100
You guys are gonna feel         
so much healthier               
when you eat like this.         

20:00.200 --> 20:01.800
        I'm not kidding.        
 You'll have a lot more energy. 

20:01.800 --> 20:04.500
 Your bodies will feel lighter. 
 Your reflexes will be sharper. 

20:04.600 --> 20:06.900
    Oh, our reflexes are already
              much, uh, sharper.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.400
                    Carla, pull.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.000
                        Pull.   

20:15.500 --> 20:16.800
            Frasier.            

20:21.400 --> 20:24.400
Frasier, I owe you              
an apology.                     

20:24.400 --> 20:26.700
I haven't been myself           
the past couple of days.        

20:26.800 --> 20:28.000
              No, darling.      

20:28.100 --> 20:30.300
    I, I trivialized your grief.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.100
                A husband should
                  be supportive.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.800
         But, please... help me.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.300
                    Help me.    

20:36.400 --> 20:38.400
                Meet me halfway.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.500
Why were you carrying a moribund
     rodent in your evening bag?

20:41.600 --> 20:45.100
I wasn't going to take          
him on our date.                

20:45.100 --> 20:47.400
But I knew if I left            
him at the lab,                 

20:47.500 --> 20:49.400
they'd have given him to        
the undergraduates to dissect.  

20:49.500 --> 20:51.700
I couldn't let that             
happen to Whitey.               

20:51.700 --> 20:53.800
I just wanted to give           
him a decent burial.            

20:53.900 --> 20:55.800
              I'm, I'm so sorry.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.500
        How could I have been   
                 so insensitive?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.600
Of course, I overreacted.       

20:59.700 --> 21:01.200
But I think I know why.         

21:01.200 --> 21:02.600
I was confronted                

21:02.600 --> 21:04.100
for the first time              

21:04.100 --> 21:05.800
with the death of               
someone close to me.            

21:05.900 --> 21:07.200
             I understand, dear.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.600
     It's what we call a crisis.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.100
I know what we call it,         
Frasier.                        

21:14.100 --> 21:17.300
The upshot is I've never        
been more acutely aware         

21:17.300 --> 21:20.300
of how precious and fragile     
life is for each of us.         

21:20.300 --> 21:22.100
          Well, darling, I think
            everyone would agree

21:22.100 --> 21:25.000
            that existence is   
                tenuous at best.

21:25.100 --> 21:28.700
        Therefore, all we can   
             do is embrace life.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.200
                  And you and I,
             we're so fortunate.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.000
             We, we have a baby,
 the very symbol of life reborn.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.800
Frasier, he's no longer a baby. 

21:36.900 --> 21:38.700
    He'll be going to school    
         in September.          

21:38.800 --> 21:41.900
 Oh, yes, if we can successfully
 negotiate a preschool interview

21:41.900 --> 21:43.100
                without slipping
                    into a scene

21:43.200 --> 21:44.600
            from <i>Who's Afraid</i>   
              <i>of Virginia Woolf?</i>

21:46.500 --> 21:48.500
     But, darling, you're right.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.300
     Frederick is getting older.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.500
         You know there is a way

21:52.600 --> 21:55.600
                  we could renew
            ourselves yet again.

21:55.700 --> 21:58.200
How would we do that?           

21:58.200 --> 22:00.700
    We could have another child.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.500
  We could, couldn't we?        

22:03.400 --> 22:05.300
That's a wonderful idea.        

22:05.300 --> 22:08.200
Oh, Frasier, suddenly,          
I'm filled with a glow.         

22:08.200 --> 22:10.000
Let's start right now.          

22:11.400 --> 22:13.700
      It's all so strange.      

22:13.800 --> 22:18.100
A seemingly insignificant       
creature lives and dies...      

22:18.200 --> 22:20.900
  a marriage is threatened...   

22:21.000 --> 22:23.700
      a child's education       
     is almost destroyed...     

22:23.800 --> 22:26.400
     yet, somehow, someway,     

22:26.500 --> 22:29.300
    I'm getting some action     
        out of it.
