WEBVTT

00:05.213 --> 00:06.923
Here we go.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.010
(HORN BLASTS) Wooo!

00:21.062 --> 00:25.567
Are you in it for love,
or are you in it for the money?

00:38.246 --> 00:41.416
Our friend, Mike Benz, he's from LA.

00:41.499 --> 00:44.085
He's in fashion as well.
He takes us under his wing.

00:44.169 --> 00:46.671
And we go for it. In boss mode when
we're around him.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.631
He's Mister Miami.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.016
OM Silva.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.020
Michael is like a brother to us.

01:02.103 --> 01:05.565
Before I met Florian, he saw that
I was in a unhealthy relationship

01:05.648 --> 01:08.401
and helped me get out of
that toxic relationship.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.029
He's definitely a protector.
Is he making you happy?

01:11.112 --> 01:12.781
He's making a lot of strides.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.658
He hasn't spent one dollar since
he's been in Connecticut.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.745
Darcey pays for everything, takes
him shopping, buys the food.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.624
When do I get to meet your boy?
I want to know the guys that are
dating my girls.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.764
(POP MUSIC)

01:50.193 --> 01:52.278
Aaaah!

01:52.362 --> 01:54.239
It's hot.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.074
Oh, thank you.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.660
Are you dying? Oh, my God.
Are your feet on fire?

01:58.743 --> 02:01.246
My feet are on fire.
It's good exercise.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.708
Today is gonna be
a fun-in-the-sun day

02:04.791 --> 02:06.960
with our cousin Shannon
and her family.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.963
Stacey and I have been spending all
morning communicating

02:10.046 --> 02:12.132
with our team in LA,
fitting in work calls,

02:12.215 --> 02:15.510
making sure all the logistics are
ready to go for the fashion show.

02:15.593 --> 02:18.430
And we've been organising
all the models

02:18.513 --> 02:20.265
for the casting call tomorrow.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.642
But today, honestly...

02:22.726 --> 02:25.186
(SIGHS) We just want to be with
family

02:25.270 --> 02:30.233
before we have to dedicate all of
our time to the fashion show.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.613
Wow. This is the dream life.
This is the dream, guys.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.074
Like old times - Yeah.
..when we were kids,

02:38.158 --> 02:41.703
went to the beach in Connecticut.
I know. It's beautiful.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.580
You guys want to play volleyball?

02:43.663 --> 02:46.041
Why don't you guys go now?
All right.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.668
Yeah. That sounds fun. Fun.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.463
Have fun, guys. Where did you get
this captain's hat?

02:51.546 --> 02:53.798
I know. Look at them. I love it.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.009
Are they having fun, you guys?
Yeah.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.636
The girls are excited to be here and
they're glowing.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.264
Finally. They don't want to leave.
We went on a boat.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.641
What? Like a deep-sea fishing boat.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.602
Georgi planned it.
It was a surprise.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.523
Yeah.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.401
That's really nice, Georgi.
I love that. Yeah, yeah.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.654
He picked out a different boat,
but they gave us a different one.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.787
Looked like we were going to sink.
But did you guys have a great time?
We did.

03:26.956 --> 03:30.210
What did the girls think?
They loved it. Aspen was excited.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.253
Aniko, it took her a minute to get
into it.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.382
She wanted to be more like...
Something glamorous.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.677
Something more glam. Yacht life.
Well, I kind of felt that too.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.304
And it was more like Gilligan's
Island. Exactly.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.932
It was like that kind of boat.
Swear to God.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.602
I'm so glad that Georgi's been
putting all the efforts that he's

03:47.686 --> 03:49.688
been putting in on this trip to
Miami.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.481
And Shannon even notices it.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.442
So for Shannon to notice it,
really hits home.

03:54.526 --> 03:59.239
It makes me feel like
I have a good guy by my side.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.742
Ah! Thank God.

04:02.826 --> 04:06.371
Hey. Hey. Yes. You made it.

04:06.454 --> 04:08.206
Thank God. My baby.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.500
Hey. What's up, Rayray?

04:10.583 --> 04:13.003
Give everybody love. Hey.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.046
How was the presentation, Ray?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.798
All right, boss.

04:16.881 --> 04:20.010
You saw the guys are playing
volleyball? Yeah. Let's go play.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.886
Have fun, you guys.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.305
Darcey, this has to be good -
It's really good.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.057
..to see Georgi with the girls.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.601
This is like kind of what I've been
waiting to see.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.272
I want him to bond with the girls
and for them to feel comfortable.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.983
You know, we've had a rocky road,
rocky relationship.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.318
And you know, I thought it was
completely done,

04:37.402 --> 04:39.487
but we're, you know,
working things out.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.657
It's interesting, cos I haven't
spent a lot of time around them,

04:42.741 --> 04:46.745
just a few days, but I actually see
some similarities

04:46.828 --> 04:49.247
between Georgi and your ex-husband.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.416
Sure.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.419
I mean, they're both Eastern
European. Eastern European.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.422
A little bit younger.
My ex-husband has the long hair.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.840
Ponytail. Ponytail.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.593
Gymnast. Body-builder.
Same kind of height, build.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.679
Do you think that there's a chance
that what didn't work out

05:04.763 --> 05:07.474
in your first marriage
is any of the same things -

05:07.557 --> 05:11.311
Interesting. ..that is like a tell
for you or like a trigger for you?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.606
Yeah.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.943
I was married for eight years with
my ex-husband,

05:19.027 --> 05:21.029
Aniko and Aspen's father.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.989
We dated for two years prior.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.908
I got married in New York City.

05:24.991 --> 05:28.745
It was a beautiful wedding.
It was like a fairy tale.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.830
In the beginning
of the relationship,

05:30.914 --> 05:33.667
we talked about our dreams,
our goals, our aspirations.

05:33.750 --> 05:38.880
And he did some, but lacked a lot of
it when it really mattered.

05:40.048 --> 05:44.302
Lacked the motivation at times,
financially, to get ahead.

05:44.386 --> 05:47.555
What I'm realising,
talking with Shannon

05:47.639 --> 05:51.226
is that Georgi has a lot of
these qualities too,

05:51.309 --> 05:55.021
and it's like,
"Whoa, wait a second here."

05:58.608 --> 06:01.361
Yeah, maybe it does, you know,
and there was a lot of times

06:01.444 --> 06:06.157
I was disappointed for my ex and
I didn't see the motivation in him.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.535
He didn't have the motivation, like
that drive

06:08.618 --> 06:10.286
that I thought he was going to have.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.706
He would talk about these things
he wanted to do,

06:12.789 --> 06:14.791
but never really took action towards
it.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.210
That's kind of the same vibe I feel
from Georgi,

06:17.293 --> 06:18.962
but I just don't see that drive.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.882
Maybe it bothers you that much more
because it brings up old wounds.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.427
Yeah. I don't know.
I'm not a therapist.

06:25.510 --> 06:28.513
No, but it makes sense. I never
thought of it like that, but yeah.

06:28.596 --> 06:31.558
It could be a real trigger for you
where you see something small

06:31.641 --> 06:34.436
and you're like, "This is
interesting." "Here we go again."

06:34.519 --> 06:37.897
Yes. Subconsciously, "Oh, boy!"
It's possible. Could be, yeah.

06:37.981 --> 06:42.027
I admire Darcey that she's willing
to give Georgi another chance.

06:42.110 --> 06:46.281
There is a very special person that
is willing to give second chances.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.410
So I don't know. I mean,
of course I'm concerned for her.

06:50.493 --> 06:54.289
I hope this Miami trip is enough
time for them to be able

06:54.372 --> 06:57.584
to really work on all the things
that they need to work on,

06:57.667 --> 07:00.920
and also they can both be in
a really happy place.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.964
Listen, at the end of the day,

07:03.048 --> 07:06.343
whatever happens with these
relationships - Yeah. ..are great.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.013
There is nothing more important
than that relationship with your
girls,

07:10.096 --> 07:11.806
with your boys, with your kids.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.351
I just want to see them happy, and I
want to be happy.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.937
In the beginning, I wasn't really
sure Georgi should come to Miami

07:18.021 --> 07:22.067
because Darcey's relationship with
Georgi is just a (BLEEP) mess.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.779
But messes can get picked up and
cleaned up.

07:25.862 --> 07:30.200
I see the improvements and I see
the efforts Georgi's putting in.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.119
I feel like
Georgi is growing on me.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.622
Don't mess up, Ani. Let's go, Ani.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.500
Come on! Yeah!

07:40.126 --> 07:42.462
Yes. Good job.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.465
I'm impressed
by Georgi's volleyball skills.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.842
So...

07:49.928 --> 07:51.638
(LAUGHS)

07:52.972 --> 07:54.724
Three-three win.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.685
Jesus.

08:00.855 --> 08:03.149
Aw. So cute.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.318
Oh!

08:07.362 --> 08:09.364
I need a break after that one.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.866
Let's go. All right.
We're going to go on a break.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.827
Yes. All right.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.748
My feet are on fire.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.500
They're like old-lady feet.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.335
Ew.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.170
I feel so old.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.007
Literally, it felt like yesterday
I was in eighth grade,

08:27.090 --> 08:28.800
and now I'm about to be a senior.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.053
I'm ready. You're ready? Yeah.
I'm ready too, honestly.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.848
I've been wanting to go to college
for the longest time.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.851
But now that like it's almost here,
I'm getting like scared.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.145
Yeah? Mm-hm. (LAUGHS)

08:41.271 --> 08:45.066
Me and Rayray are the same age and
we're super-duper close.

08:45.150 --> 08:49.404
Someone being your own age and like
especially if they're your family,

08:49.487 --> 08:52.032
it's so cool cos you get to relate
to them on stuff.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.285
Anything that's going on with you,
they'll always be there for you

08:55.368 --> 08:59.998
cos they're going through the same
thing also, especially like school
and stuff.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.459
Have you thought about where you
wanted to go yet?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.211
No. Yeah.
Just anywhere for basketball?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.172
Nothing much. That's good.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.133
Wherever you go, like, I wouldn't
mind going to your games.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.511
Even if you're all the way in like
Michigan or something, I'll come.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.307
(LAUGHS) You're right.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.184
My scouting of cute guys.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.772
I'm just trying
to live my best life.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.942
I feel more comfortable talking to
Rayray about dating

09:28.026 --> 09:31.571
cos he has a girlfriend right now
that he really loves and cares for.

09:31.654 --> 09:35.825
And it gives me like input on like
what guys want in girls.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.245
It'd be different talking to my mom
cos she sees me as her little girl.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.248
She's like, "Oh, my gosh.
You're dating now? What the heck?"

09:42.332 --> 09:44.501
Honestly, do you have any cute
friends, like?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.753
I've already shown you all my
friends. I know.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.546
But, like, is there any more?

09:50.090 --> 09:53.259
Having someone your own age and
like having like his friends,

09:53.343 --> 09:55.845
like if his friend is cute,
I want him, him or him.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.597
And like same thing with me.

09:57.681 --> 10:01.393
If he thinks one of my friends is
cute, he'll go like, "I want her,
her or her."

10:01.476 --> 10:03.186
Oh, my God.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.482
I find it so ironic and hilarious
that the twins and my grandpa

10:07.565 --> 10:12.153
always go for younger, foreign
people. I didn't want to do that.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.198
Because I don't go for foreign
and I only go for older.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.410
But look, I would never...
I tell everyone this.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.370
I would never go for a guy younger
than me

10:20.453 --> 10:22.997
because I always picture them
as immature. Yeah.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.710
Even though the older guys are
immature too. (LAUGHS)

10:26.793 --> 10:29.295
So what do you think about Georgi?

10:32.048 --> 10:34.843
Oh, my God. The other day,
he had a little surprise for us.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.805
So I was dressed up like
I was going to Nantucket.

10:38.888 --> 10:43.810
He took me on a rusty, dusty,
crusty deep-sea fishing boat -

10:43.893 --> 10:46.730
Attractive. ..with like worms.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.650
I literally, I like, oh, my God...
Did he make you fish?

10:50.734 --> 10:52.444
I ended up fishing.

10:52.527 --> 10:56.573
I mean, it was like relaxing, but
like I was so shocked that I did it.

10:56.656 --> 11:01.369
Since we were trapped on that boat
with him in the middle of the ocean,

11:01.453 --> 11:04.998
no way to get out,
I interrogated him so bad.

11:05.081 --> 11:09.002
I was like, "Are you in it for
money, or are you in it for love?"

11:09.085 --> 11:10.754
I went that far.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.965
Georgi told me that he's in this
relationship for love,

11:14.049 --> 11:16.551
and I believe what he said.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.596
But actions speak louder than words
at the end of the day,

11:19.679 --> 11:22.307
and that's what really is going to
prove to me

11:22.390 --> 11:24.684
that he's with my mom
for the right reasons.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.770
I mean, that's important to know,

11:26.853 --> 11:30.357
cos you can never know what
their true meanings are. Yeah.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.525
Cos you know my mom's past
relationships.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.694
It showed that they were in it for
the clout.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.571
And as soon as they got it, they
dipped

11:36.654 --> 11:39.741
or they turned to crazy talk
so my mom left them. Yeah.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.744
I'm really proud of Aniko
for asking those questions.

11:42.827 --> 11:46.164
Because most people, they don't
have the balls to say that, really.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.709
People are constantly going for the
money and just wanna leave quickly.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.587
So those are important questions
that Aniko asked.

11:52.671 --> 11:56.049
Aniko, Rayray, we going swimming.
Coming? OK. Yeah, we're coming.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.801
OK, let's go.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.440
What's up? Hey.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.485
You guys ready to roll? Yeah.
You've been ready. Yeah.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.654
Guys, we're ready to roll.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.031
Hey. Hey.

12:20.115 --> 12:24.786
So Aniko and Aspen are sleeping at
Shannon's house which is super-sweet

12:24.869 --> 12:27.664
and that gives us a chance
to finally

12:27.747 --> 12:29.958
have Michael come down
to meet the guys.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.878
He's coming to the beach and we're
going to have a little barbecue.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.553
Actually, Mike's on his way.
He's coming to meet us.

12:47.142 --> 12:48.852
He's our friend.

12:48.935 --> 12:52.605
So you guys get to know him, we talk
about all our friends in LA.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.234
It's a good opportunity to meet him.
It's not late,

12:56.317 --> 12:58.820
and he's only here for like
a couple more days. Yeah.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.780
We figured this is
the perfect time.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.378
Is that OK?

13:20.300 --> 13:24.054
I'm real excited that Michael gets
to meet Georgi and Florian tonight

13:24.137 --> 13:27.057
because, you know,
they mean the most to us.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.685
I know Michael has his concerns
about Georgi,

13:30.769 --> 13:36.524
but now is the time for Michael to
see Georgi's really good qualities

13:36.608 --> 13:38.401
and why I want to be with him.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.403
I really hope he'll see that.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.406
We appreciate you guys doing this.
Come on, babe.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.996
(DANCE MUSIC)

14:04.010 --> 14:05.679
Oh. What did you get?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.974
It's the thought that counts.
What did you get there?

14:11.935 --> 14:14.896
All right.
Ah, you did it big, baby.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.774
Yeah. Guys grill.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.235
I'm excited for all the guys
to meet tonight.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.446
We've known Michael for
a long time, and I really,

14:23.530 --> 14:28.118
honestly think that they're
actually going to be like friends.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.412
Ooh. How do you start that grill,
babe?

14:30.495 --> 14:32.163
When I was little, I...

14:32.247 --> 14:33.873
Oh, shit. Careful.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.668
Florian always used to barbecue
with his dad in the back.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.131
Oh, great.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.884
I think I want to move. They're
about to get that fire started.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.845
(CLICKING)

14:46.928 --> 14:48.596
Watch out.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.307
Babe. Wow. Holy (BLEEP).

14:51.391 --> 14:53.143
(LAUGHTER) Move!

14:53.226 --> 14:55.103
Georgi, stop it.

14:55.186 --> 14:57.605
You guys.
That's too much. That's too much.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.607
You love to play with fire?

15:01.484 --> 15:04.612
Mm. With this hair, and this amount
of product in it,

15:04.696 --> 15:06.448
I hope you don't catch me on fire.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.324
Pssshoo!

15:09.868 --> 15:12.996
All right. Let's - We'll set
the table. We'll set the table.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.624
Here's Michael. He's here.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.419
Yo! Hey, Mike. Hey.
I got drinks, baby.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.296
Oh, thank you. What's up, girl?

15:21.379 --> 15:23.965
Look at you. Thank you for coming.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.551
Look at you. Yes.
Thank you for coming.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.720
You hug me. Oh. My brother.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.139
Oh. What's up, girls? Yeah, hey.

15:31.222 --> 15:33.558
Come meet the guys.
These are the dudes?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.977
These are the dudes.
Florian, my hubby.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.937
This your hubby? What's up, my man?

15:38.021 --> 15:40.106
This is Florian.
How's it going, bro?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.692
Georgi, come say hi.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.861
What's going on, bro?
How's it going?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.905
What's going on, man?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.740
All right. All right. OK.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.825
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, take a seat.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.619
You want to sit in the middle?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.622
We're going to have to squeeze on
each side. Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.208
How are you?
You guys want something to drink?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.092
(LAUGHS)

16:07.175 --> 16:09.427
Ooh. Let's get some drinks.

16:09.511 --> 16:13.807
Yeah. Let's get some drinks. Yeah.
Let's get this party started.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.938
You look like you need two drinks.
Yeah. You need two.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.107
Crack it open, baby.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.401
Don't be shy.
You got your own drinks. OK.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.737
So we got some sun. Feeling good.
Sit down. Yeah.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.116
Let's cheers to a fun evening and
getting to know each other. Cheers.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.910
Let's cheers to, you know...
To friendship. And family.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.330
No cheers over there? What's going
on? To new friendship. And family.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.499
Good. To new friendships
and family.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.836
Yeah, yeah. No. We good. Yeah.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.255
So the guys are excited
that you're here. Yeah.

16:46.798 --> 16:48.758
You wait for this day. Wow.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.678
We've known you since what?
2014, like?

16:51.761 --> 16:54.681
Longer. Gee. Yeah. Yeah.
Let's go back.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.851
We don't need to go back in time
because it's all about the future.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.728
Right. There you go.

16:59.811 --> 17:04.816
You know, you got to remember,
you know, you're with goddesses.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.320
Can I get your attention too, sir?

17:38.516 --> 17:41.019
Do I cook for goddesses? Yes.
I've done that before.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.855
No, I'm asking you just to just
to come sit down with us.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.815
It's a respect thing.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.776
Then turn it down.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.611
It's not going to burn.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.198
I can understand that you're
uncomfortable right now.

17:53.281 --> 17:55.033
I'm just looking out for my sis.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.619
You know, Georgi,
he's a pretty tough dude.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.788
You can't crack his wall,
and I get that.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.624
But I feel like he needs to let
his guard down a little bit.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.293
I've known the girls for years.
This is family.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.712
These girls deserve the best,
and I'm just here

18:07.796 --> 18:09.964
to make sure that's what they're
getting.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.925
Sir, Florian...

18:15.762 --> 18:17.430
Florian. Florian, right?

18:17.514 --> 18:19.599
Florian. Yeah. OK. What's my name?

18:19.683 --> 18:21.559
No, Michael, not Mike.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.437
No, it's not the same thing.

18:30.193 --> 18:33.321
OK. Bro, just respect my name.

18:33.405 --> 18:36.199
I like Michael. If I said,
"My name's Mike," it'd be Mike.

18:44.666 --> 18:47.210
Hey, let's start over again.
My name's Michael.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.045
Your name is Florian.

18:49.129 --> 18:50.880
All right.

18:50.964 --> 18:54.718
So I know Stacey says everything's
all good and they're happy,

18:54.801 --> 18:57.721
everything's fine,
but Florian's subtle.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.514
He's more chill. I don't know, man.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.766
I need to make sure these dudes are
legit.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.895
These are like my, like, yeah, like
sisters, family,

19:05.979 --> 19:08.189
like whatever you want to call it,
you know?

19:08.273 --> 19:10.025
This is, this is how I see things.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.485
I get it. You're married to Stacey.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.279
I love that.

19:14.362 --> 19:18.575
You have to treat her as if there's
no other woman in the world.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.452
OK?

19:22.203 --> 19:23.955
I'm not done yet.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.293
So this is what I know.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.378
I know that if any time in life,

19:30.462 --> 19:36.384
she calls me and says something
like, X, Y, Z or something happened,

19:36.468 --> 19:39.804
I'll be the guy you have to deal
with as the big bro.

19:42.182 --> 19:45.477
We appreciate Michael taking a stand
for us and having our back.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.854
We understand he's coming from
a good place,

19:47.937 --> 19:50.815
but it's coming in too hot and
too heavy and - And too quick.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.609
..too quick.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.861
It's uncomfortable because it's
putting us

19:54.944 --> 19:56.863
in an awkward position
with our guys.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.659
Can we cheers now? Yeah.
Can we, can we, can we cheers?

20:01.743 --> 20:04.871
Georgi, when are we going to have a
conversation? What's up, man?

20:04.954 --> 20:06.706
Give me some time, bro.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.212
Oh (BLEEP). Get out of here, bro.
What are you talking about?

20:12.295 --> 20:14.047
Come on, man.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.511
You're funny.

20:24.099 --> 20:27.018
OK. OK. Perfect.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.730
Some of the shit
I've been hearing about you, bro,

20:30.814 --> 20:33.733
is not really cool.
Not cool with me.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.736
I don't know if you're, you like
doing that (BLEEP) to girls,

20:36.820 --> 20:38.530
but you can't do that to this girl.

20:38.613 --> 20:40.740
Money in the socks.
Credit-card debt.

20:40.824 --> 20:43.034
Whatever the (BLEEP) is going on -

20:43.118 --> 20:45.704
You just can't, you can't do that.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.664
You can't.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.208
You don't know me either.
This is the first time.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.003
We're supposed to like balance
(BLEEP) out.

21:09.978 --> 21:14.024
These are things that I just found
out that are just like not,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.943
they're just, you just don't do
that.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.116
What do you...? What?

21:23.199 --> 21:25.702
Bro, listen to what you're saying
right now.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.621
You're saying you can do whatever
the (BLEEP) you want? Yes.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.168
How are you gonna
stand in front of me

21:33.251 --> 21:35.337
when you're doing (BLEEP) to my
sister?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.505
What are you talking about, bro?

21:38.757 --> 21:40.425
You can't do...

21:40.508 --> 21:43.136
What are you talking,
do whatever you want?

21:43.219 --> 21:47.390
What do you mean, it has nothing to
do with Darcey? You're trying to
marry Darcey.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.602
Oh, "I'll do what I want."
You're not realising that

21:50.685 --> 21:54.064
you're doing that to the person
you're supposed to be in love with.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.901
That's not something that makes me
OK and want to sit down.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.196
That makes me wanna come over there
and take care of you real quick.

22:03.573 --> 22:05.367
OK?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.953
No. No. Trust me. It won't be here.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.705
OK?

22:20.340 --> 22:22.008
Woo. This guy's funny.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.177
Come on, bro. Relax.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.388
Bro, should I meet you on Tuesday?

22:26.471 --> 22:28.348
We can go over that at three
o'clock.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.810
You're good, obviously.
You're real good.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.687
After what she told me, you're good.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.480
Sit. Sit, please.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.649
You talk (BLEEP). Excuse me?

22:37.732 --> 22:39.818
Relax. Back (BLEEP) up, bro.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.569
Now you're getting out of line.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.988
This is not good.
This is getting out of control.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.949
Ssh. Ssh.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.118
You can't do that (BLEEP).

22:50.328 --> 22:52.080
You can't... Yeah.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.833
You need to relax, bro.
Now you're getting out of line.

22:59.004 --> 23:00.714
What is the matter with Georgi?

23:01.965 --> 23:04.259
Georgi... Relax.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.353
I'm just in total shock.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.230
I don't even know what to say.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.065
This is not what I wanted to happen.

23:19.149 --> 23:21.609
(SIGHS)
I understand Michael's intentions.

23:21.693 --> 23:24.029
He's kind of trying to come
from a place of love,

23:24.112 --> 23:27.866
but it's totally
coming off bad and wrong.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.104
(SIGHS)

00:23:19.720 -- 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90% position:50%
Last night, after we left the beach,

24:22.295 --> 24:25.006
Georgi was very silent and he was
closed off.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.300
I feel bad personally

24:27.384 --> 24:32.514
because it was supposed to be
bonding time as family, not drama.

24:32.597 --> 24:35.058
I want us to be happy in this
relationship.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.560
I want it to be right
and feel right.

24:37.644 --> 24:41.022
I mean, we were in a good place,
and now we're kind of backtracking

24:41.106 --> 24:43.733
and that's not
a good feeling for me.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.748
I made some bagels.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.002
Not hungry?

25:07.966 --> 25:09.634
You want to talk?

25:13.221 --> 25:15.306
You know, last night.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.293
I feel like I understand where
Georgi's coming from.

25:43.376 --> 25:46.379
I should've defended him and
like turned the heat down,

25:46.463 --> 25:48.214
but I didn't.

25:48.298 --> 25:51.259
I was just so stunned,
I didn't know what to say

25:51.343 --> 25:53.094
and I didn't know what to do.

25:54.554 --> 25:58.516
That was a bit of a fail on my end,
and I'll own that.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.645
I just don't like to feel like
I'm caught in the middle

26:02.729 --> 26:04.814
of my relationship and a friendship.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.609
It's very uncomfortable.
I don't like that feeling.

26:08.777 --> 26:12.364
But I wish that I had defended him.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.743
I don't want to treat you that way.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.661
I want to respect you.

26:18.745 --> 26:22.374
I will continue to work on the
things I need to work on

26:22.457 --> 26:24.334
for myself to continue healing.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.463
There's nothing I can do or say to
take back what happened last night.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.299
I get it. Michael came in hot.
I understand that.

26:31.383 --> 26:33.051
But Stacey and I know him.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.970
That's, you know, he was protector
mode, like my brother.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.264
My brother would've been the same
way.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.644
Sure. Yeah.

26:52.362 --> 26:54.239
I do share the good things.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.991
I'm not trying to paint you out
to be a bad boyfriend.

27:23.768 --> 27:27.063
I just want you to know that
I'm sorry...

27:28.273 --> 27:33.194
..for...not having your back.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.490
I should've had your back more.

27:54.466 --> 27:58.636
I don't want to be like that with
you.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.140
I want to be in your arms, leaning
back.

28:02.223 --> 28:06.227
But sometimes I feel like
if I fall or lean back,

28:06.311 --> 28:07.979
are you going to catch me?

28:15.653 --> 28:17.364
Are you going to catch me?

28:22.660 --> 28:25.372
Let's try now. I know. Let's try.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.749
Catch me. Catch me.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.584
You ready?

28:29.668 --> 28:31.753
Ready? I'm going to fall.

28:33.004 --> 28:35.090
Are you going to catch me?

28:36.549 --> 28:38.343
Yeah.

28:42.138 --> 28:43.932
That was like half a catch.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.561
Yeah. You did catch me.

28:50.021 --> 28:53.274
I just have a request, and I feel
like it'd mean a lot to me

28:53.358 --> 28:56.861
if you and Florian can go hang out
with Michael today,

28:56.945 --> 28:58.822
maybe go to the Everglades.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.990
Stacey and I thought it'd be a good
idea

29:01.074 --> 29:04.202
for you guys to go together and like
grow it up.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.874
Stacey and I talked.

29:09.958 --> 29:14.170
We both agree that Florian and
Georgi should meet up with Michael

29:14.254 --> 29:17.882
and spend the day together so they
can kind of just hash it out

29:17.966 --> 29:19.676
and smooth things over.

29:19.759 --> 29:24.180
I feel like the guys are in our
lives, Michael's in our lives,

29:24.264 --> 29:26.558
and it's very important for them

29:26.641 --> 29:29.060
to learn to get along
and talk things out.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.313
Would that be OK?

29:34.024 --> 29:36.109
It's just a request, but I just...

30:06.806 --> 30:08.475
You do?

30:14.022 --> 30:16.107
(DANCE MUSIC)

30:23.031 --> 30:26.159
You guys ready? Yeah. Woo!

30:26.242 --> 30:28.578
It's a nice location, huh? It is.
Yeah.

30:28.661 --> 30:30.455
Hold on. Wait for Mommy.

30:30.538 --> 30:32.415
Wait, wait. Wait for your mom.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.502
Oh, no, the grass.

30:35.585 --> 30:37.671
My heels are going to get stuck.

30:39.047 --> 30:41.883
Ready? All right. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's do this.

30:41.966 --> 30:44.135
Careful of your shoes. Oh, no.
I'm fine.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.304
Should we just...? Tiptoe. Tiptoe.

30:46.388 --> 30:50.975
Today, Stacey and I are holding
a casting call for the models

30:51.059 --> 30:55.271
for a show at our general manager
Sherry's friend's house.

30:55.355 --> 30:57.440
We're wearing a vibe today.

30:57.524 --> 30:59.859
Trust me. Yeah.
We have flowing dresses on.

30:59.943 --> 31:02.987
It's very resort. I mean, we're
feeling very Miami today and -

31:03.071 --> 31:05.907
Fabulous. F-A-B, fabulous. Fab.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.618
We're going to set the vibe for
today's casting.

31:08.702 --> 31:12.497
Once you learn how to walk in
pageant heels, you can walk on any
surface.

31:12.580 --> 31:16.710
You know, I'm excited because today,
Aniko and Aspen are with us

31:16.793 --> 31:20.547
and we want them to see how we work.

31:20.630 --> 31:23.466
I want them to understand the vision
behind our company

31:23.550 --> 31:25.635
because it's a legacy. Yeah.

31:25.719 --> 31:29.180
And, you know, they can continue
the legacy one day if they choose.

31:29.264 --> 31:30.974
You guys ready?

31:31.057 --> 31:33.476
Yeah, I'm ready to see this place.
Wow.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.645
This is great. Guys, look.

31:35.729 --> 31:38.940
Ooh. Thank you, Sherry.
That's what I'm talking about.

31:39.024 --> 31:42.694
Yes. Perfect. Yes, we got the
catwalk.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.864
Who has the camera? I have the
camera. I have the camera. OK.

31:45.947 --> 31:48.658
They got the camera.
I have the film. OK. Wonderful.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.201
I'll help with the chairs.

31:50.285 --> 31:53.371
Yeah. We can put the chairs in
the sign-in desk right here.

31:53.455 --> 31:55.206
Clothes over there on the rack.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.000
Good job, Aspen.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.085
So the team is coming from LA.

31:59.169 --> 32:00.837
I'm just a little nervous

32:00.920 --> 32:04.132
because they're coming in the day
before the show.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.968
In order to stay on budget,

32:07.052 --> 32:09.387
Darcey and I decided
to fly the team in tomorrow,

32:09.471 --> 32:11.556
which is the day before the fashion
show.

32:11.639 --> 32:14.225
Which means we have to take on more
responsibility,

32:14.309 --> 32:17.687
like casting the models, and making
sure everything runs smoothly

32:17.771 --> 32:19.647
before everybody else arrives.

32:21.358 --> 32:23.068
I'm going to steal that later.

32:25.612 --> 32:29.032
So Stacey and I asked Georgi,
Florian, Aniko and Aspen

32:29.115 --> 32:30.909
to walk on the fashion show.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.370
Florian's wanting to be
a professional model.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.538
Georgi's walked in fashion shows
before.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.791
And the girls are passionate about,
you know,

32:37.874 --> 32:40.543
fashion and, you know,
modelling as well.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.295
So why not?

32:42.379 --> 32:45.090
This is the perfect opportunity for
all of them.

32:46.216 --> 32:49.469
Well, let's change this energy,
get the positive vibes flowing.

32:49.552 --> 32:51.221
Yeah, we got a big baby.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.765
House of Eleven is a feel-good
brand. That's right.

32:53.848 --> 32:56.101
And we want to make sure when the
models come in,

32:56.184 --> 32:58.770
everybody's feeling good and fine.
Ooh, I got chills.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.356
So, when the models walk in,
get their names,

33:01.439 --> 33:03.942
make sure they have their head
shots and resume.

33:04.025 --> 33:08.697
This is the first time
I really worked with them,

33:08.780 --> 33:10.990
and it's kind of cool being like in
it,

33:11.074 --> 33:13.451
and like experiencing everything.

33:13.535 --> 33:16.663
Hello. Hello. How are you?

33:16.746 --> 33:20.375
Great. Welcome to the House of
Eleven - Welcome. ..casting call.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.712
If you could just write down your
name and phone number.

33:23.795 --> 33:28.717
It's a new experience for us and
it's cool to help Mom and Stacey out

33:28.800 --> 33:31.928
to find models that we think
will be a great fit for the show.

33:32.012 --> 33:35.557
First of all, we're really grateful
to have all of you guys here.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.060
We have an amazing show coming up
for Miami Swim Week.

33:39.144 --> 33:42.022
So we'll just have you guys walk
the runway.

33:42.105 --> 33:45.275
And you know, it's not about the
outside, it's about the inside.

33:45.358 --> 33:47.444
It's, you know, a feel-good brand.

33:47.527 --> 33:50.363
And we're so happy and blessed that
you guys are here.

33:50.447 --> 33:52.115
So let's get started. Yes.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.075
Woo. Yes. Do it.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.247
Take a quick little pic. Energy.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.624
Beautiful.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.878
Whoa.

34:04.961 --> 34:06.921
Yes. Beautiful.

34:07.005 --> 34:09.507
Whoa! Oh. Woo!

34:09.591 --> 34:13.386
The industry standard for model
casting calls are kind of basic.

34:13.470 --> 34:16.014
It's just very in and out,
like a cattle call.

34:16.097 --> 34:21.311
Woo. OK. Walk, take a quick pic,
and you're out.

34:21.394 --> 34:23.897
Show them abs.
Yeah, take that shirt off.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.358
OK. It's like angel wings.

34:26.441 --> 34:28.526
Oh, my God. I love it. Angel.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.571
For our brand, we look for
personality in our models,

34:31.654 --> 34:33.365
and that's what sells.

34:33.448 --> 34:35.533
That swag.

34:35.617 --> 34:37.285
That sexy smile.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.829
Owning your worth. And energy.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.999
Not about the looks.
It's about what's on the inside.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.460
Yeah.
You got that House of Eleven glow.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.796
Wow. Definitely got that good
energy.

34:47.879 --> 34:49.964
Positive vibes. Hold on. Hold on.

34:50.048 --> 34:51.716
Oh, she want to get in.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.510
Woo.

34:53.593 --> 34:55.804
All right. Yeah.
That's how we do it.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.597
Sizzling hot.

34:57.681 --> 35:00.100
Most of the time when going to
castings,

35:00.183 --> 35:02.477
it's really cold and unwelcoming.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.437
But this was completely different.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.189
Oh!

35:06.272 --> 35:08.900
Snap! There we go.

35:08.983 --> 35:11.861
Big energy from the inside out.

35:11.945 --> 35:14.072
Darcey and Stacey are hilarious.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.032
Get into the groove. You know?

35:16.116 --> 35:18.535
I definitely just, I love them,

35:18.618 --> 35:21.121
so I'm praying that I'll actually
be in the show.

35:21.204 --> 35:23.623
Thank you for being a part of House
of Eleven.

35:23.707 --> 35:25.875
You guys can go in there and get
changed,

35:25.959 --> 35:27.836
and we'll keep in contact with you.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.796
Thank you. Thank you all.
Thank you.

35:29.879 --> 35:33.341
Love the energy. It was amazing.
You guys look beautiful.

35:33.425 --> 35:35.510
Perfect. Stunning. Yes. Woo!

35:37.554 --> 35:39.431
Come on. Aspen, you're next.

35:39.514 --> 35:42.183
After seeing all these professional
models,

35:42.267 --> 35:44.561
I'm like, "Oh, I am not ready for
this."

35:44.644 --> 35:47.230
You got to practice
because you're in the show too.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.399
Yes. There's my girl.
Look at that. Yes.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.401
You're so tall. You got this.

35:51.484 --> 35:53.194
You're in the show. I'm scared.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.363
Don't be scared.
Aspen, you got this.

35:57.115 --> 35:58.867
I'm just freaking out.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.702
I'm not going to be good enough.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.579
I can't walk like them.

36:02.662 --> 36:04.330
I've never done anything like this

36:04.414 --> 36:07.375
and I don't want to be that one
person who messes up their show.

36:09.502 --> 36:11.671
Yeah. Yeah.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.840
Look at you. Wow.

Cool.

37:09.896 --> 37:12.399
Traffic, man. What can I say, bro?

37:14.401 --> 37:16.695
This is the twins' idea.

37:18.947 --> 37:20.657
Of course.

37:37.549 --> 37:39.217
You here for the boat ride?

37:39.300 --> 37:41.386
Yeah. OK. Come on. Follow me, sir.

37:42.929 --> 37:46.016
I don't know if this is a good idea
or not, but Darcey and Stacey,

37:46.099 --> 37:48.685
they asked me to be here
and I'll do anything for them.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.479
And I'm going to give them support
and see what happens.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.940
It could go this way or it could go
that way.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.277
After last night, I really don't
know.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.029
Hold onto your butts.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.323
Yeah.

38:02.407 --> 38:04.284
(BLEEP) go.

38:19.049 --> 38:20.925

simmer things down.

You got food too, bro?
Well, I got some.

Sometimes it'll bring them out.
Sometimes it won't, so we'll see.

so the females are building nests.

40:11.536 --> 40:13.747
Oh, shit.
Getting ready to have babies.

40:13.830 --> 40:16.541
Males, you have to be careful with
during mating season

40:16.624 --> 40:19.586
cos they get very protective and
they figure if you're a male,

40:19.669 --> 40:21.755
you're a challenge to their
girlfriend.

40:28.345 --> 40:33.016
Stay away from his girlfriend
is the main thing. He gets nasty.

That sounds good. Yeah.

they take them for granted,

comes in

and, you know, tries to -

40:45.820 --> 40:48.948
Says, "Hey, look. You're not paying
attention." I can relate.

and listen.

Even though I came in hot last
night, if I have to,

41:23.024 --> 41:26.986
I can take the high road and be
the bigger man and apologise first.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.840
You know, we all had hot tempers.

41:46.923 --> 41:50.468
But let's like think about
the girls right now.

41:57.017 --> 41:59.894
You know what I'm saying?
Like let's humble ourselves.

41:59.978 --> 42:02.605
Like, let's put the bad vibes back.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.816
Let them go. Move forward.

42:04.899 --> 42:07.444
They're just vibes now, man,
just old vibes.

42:19.956 --> 42:22.042
Yeah.

42:25.628 --> 42:28.131
Yeah. What's up, G?

42:29.758 --> 42:31.968
Aw, you know, just,
I think about you.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.596
OK, I have concerns still, you know.

42:34.679 --> 42:36.681
I still...
I'm on the fence, you know,

42:36.765 --> 42:38.433
with you and Darce cos of things

42:38.516 --> 42:40.393
that happened and whatever, but...

42:40.477 --> 42:42.145
You know?

42:43.396 --> 42:45.065
Just wanted to voice it to you.

42:45.148 --> 42:46.816
That's all.

43:15.011 --> 43:17.514
I'm glad you voiced that, man.
That means a lot.

43:17.597 --> 43:20.433
I appreciate you guys.
I think you guys are cool.

43:20.517 --> 43:23.770
You know? If you want to move
forward, let's do it, man.

43:23.853 --> 43:25.939
Let's start right here, right now.

43:26.022 --> 43:28.108
We don't have to be the bestest
homies,

43:28.191 --> 43:33.363
but the girls want us
to just, you know, coexist.

43:33.446 --> 43:36.908
You know?
So I'm down if you're down, man.

43:36.991 --> 43:39.077
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)

43:43.123 --> 43:45.291
Crickets. (LAUGHS)

43:51.798 --> 43:53.466
All right.

44:21.494 --> 44:24.289
They're causing difficulties
the day before the show.

44:24.372 --> 44:27.083
I don't wanna like walk like that,
you know.

44:28.209 --> 44:30.712
This is the building?
This is the building.

44:30.795 --> 44:33.548
I contacted a broker, and Florian
and I are going to go

44:33.631 --> 44:35.508
look at an apartment here in Miami.

44:35.592 --> 44:38.720
This is a dream come true. Yeah.
Two-bath. Walk-in closet.

44:38.803 --> 44:40.472
It's around 5,000.

44:42.307 --> 44:44.017
We have to compromise.

44:45.769 --> 44:47.437
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

44:47.520 --> 44:50.023
Aspen! Oh, my God. (SCREAMS)

44:53.068 --> 44:55.362
(COUGHS) That shit was scary.

44:56.946 --> 44:58.823
Oh, it was a (BLEEP) nightmare.

45:01.951 --> 45:05.246
I really appreciate that Georgi
wants to spend more time with me

45:05.330 --> 45:08.667
and the kids, but I'm worried about
his finances.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.795
You paid for deep-sea fishing
and then this.

45:11.878 --> 45:14.422
I know these boat rentals aren't
cheap.

45:14.506 --> 45:17.300
Just a little worried about
the money you're spending.

45:21.513 --> 45:23.390
Girls, you gotta go to hair and
make-up.

45:28.895 --> 45:31.731
We spent a lot of money and time
on this fashion show.

45:31.815 --> 45:34.317
House of Eleven models, please go
downstairs.

45:34.401 --> 45:37.320
We need to make sure this is a hit,
cos I can't fail.

45:37.404 --> 45:40.198
We have five more minutes.
We have to hurry, Darce.

45:42.325 --> 45:44.411
