WEBVTT

00:16.640 --> 00:17.640
Daniel?

00:17.720 --> 00:22.040
Hey. It's me, Brooke. Everything's okay.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.680
You just came out of hypnosis.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.920
What?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.960
Here. Give her some water.

00:39.920 --> 00:40.920
So...

00:42.160 --> 00:43.320
what do you remember?

00:44.480 --> 00:45.480
I...

00:46.480 --> 00:47.840
I remember a cave...

00:48.680 --> 00:50.000
There was a cell.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.440
Marcus wouldn't let me out.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.840
[stutters] And what did he want from you?

00:54.920 --> 00:57.880
He kept apologizing,
but he wouldn't let me go.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.440
-[breathing heavily]
-Oh...

00:59.520 --> 01:02.120
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
I know it's hard.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.680
And then she came over.

01:08.120 --> 01:09.120
Who?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.080
Your mother.

01:20.520 --> 01:22.520
[theme music playing]

02:09.360 --> 02:11.160
Why would she do something like that?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.280
Brooke was on to her.
I guess she didn't have any other choice.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.880
What else can you remember
about where you were?

02:19.600 --> 02:23.160
Try to think about what you saw.
Sounds, smells...

02:23.240 --> 02:26.160
Yeah, um... uh...

02:28.760 --> 02:31.040
[stutters] It was... It was dark.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.640
I heard a lot of beeping sounds,
like computer sounds.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.840
I saw some light...

02:37.960 --> 02:42.560
There was a giant black rock
behind a glass wall.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.640
[stammers] I don't know.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.920
That sounds like the magnetite
my mom discovered.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.600
That's what connects your mom to my mom.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Wait. Where are you going?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.840
-To find Marcus.
-Are you crazy?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.720
I'm not afraid of him
and I think he wants to help.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.880
He locked me up in a cell
and hypnotized me.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.400
He's also the one who gave us
the keyword to wake you up.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.240
I have a feeling we can trust him.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.680
-Is he here?
-Uh, I don't think so.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.200
I got the strangest note from him.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.400
[doorknob rattling]

03:26.120 --> 03:27.520
[keys jangling]

03:39.760 --> 03:41.560
[music playing over speakers]

03:42.240 --> 03:45.040
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No couch potatoes in this clubhouse.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.680
Come on. Get up on your feet.
Let's go for a run.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.840
I'm not in the mood.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.440
Hello. Those endorphins are gonna be great
for your mood, I promise you. Let's go.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.840
Another time, okay?

03:52.920 --> 03:54.360
[sighs]

03:54.440 --> 03:57.880
Fine. It is my job to cheer you up.

03:57.960 --> 04:00.640
Besides, I don't think
you're really allowed to say no

04:00.720 --> 04:04.160
when your captain asks you to play,
so let's get it.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.920
-I promise, you'll thank me later.
-[sighs]

04:06.760 --> 04:10.960
It's a nightmare.
I can't believe they did this to me.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.480
Brooke, it's all over now.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.000
But how could I have let this happen?

04:17.079 --> 04:21.040
Hey, don't beat yourself up about this.
None of this was your fault.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.560
How long have I been like this?

04:22.640 --> 04:25.120
[sighs] About a week.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.360
A whole week?

04:31.320 --> 04:34.800
How did you even figure it out?
How did you know I was hypnotized?

04:37.880 --> 04:42.200
You kept saying the same sentence
over and over.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.840
What sentence?

04:44.520 --> 04:46.360
You kept saying, um...

04:47.920 --> 04:49.520
"We were meant to be."

04:56.680 --> 04:59.040
She said that to me. Judy.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.640
Can you believe it?

05:00.720 --> 05:02.680
She made sure I wouldn't tell on her,

05:02.760 --> 05:06.160
and then she figured,
why not use this to get us back together.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.080
[scoffs]

05:12.200 --> 05:13.800
I remember now.

05:15.560 --> 05:20.320
I was with Alex.
I kissed him before all this happened.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.160
[sighs]

05:29.640 --> 05:30.880
When did he leave?

05:32.160 --> 05:35.960
I don't know. But he just sent me
his letter of resignation.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
What?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.400
That was precisely my reaction.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.560
You know, I've been working with him since
the time your mother was a student here.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.200
Yeah, I know.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.600
People are so unpredictable.
How could he just leave like this?

05:52.560 --> 05:53.800
Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...

05:53.880 --> 05:58.640
So, um, what did you need from Marcus?
Maybe it's something I can help you with.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.000
No, um, a light bulb
went out in the clubhouse.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.640
I'm gonna go back. See you.

06:04.720 --> 06:05.760
See you.

06:09.400 --> 06:14.720
You know, I honestly thought you wanted
to get back together with me.

06:16.560 --> 06:19.560
-I was happy about it. [sighs]
-[door opens]

06:19.640 --> 06:21.760
He ran away. You guys won't believe it.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.080
He emptied his office,
wrote your dad a letter of resignation

06:24.160 --> 06:25.640
and left just like that.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.400
Are you two okay?

06:33.840 --> 06:36.080
We have to tell Hayley about Jason.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.400
You realize this is only a hunch?
We don't have anything more than that.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.760
This is more than a hunch, Max.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.000
You were the one who always sensed
something weird was going on.

06:43.080 --> 06:45.960
-I was the one who always dismissed it.
-Still, this could all be a coincidence.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.240
Call Emma.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.280
-What?
-Call her right now.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.080
[line beeping]

06:59.120 --> 07:03.240
Weird. Her phone line's been disconnected.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.920
Is this another coincidence?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.560
You know, I can't stand this anymore.
I'm gonna go confront her.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.080
-Who?
-My mother.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.720
And I'm not leaving
till she tells me everything.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.920
Daniel, I think it's a mistake.
We don't know what they're planning.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.600
That's exactly what I intend
on finding out.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.280
How? I mean, best case scenario,
she lies to you,

07:22.360 --> 07:24.760
worst case scenario,
she disappears like Marcus.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.440
And then where will we be?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.120
[Daniel sighs]

07:29.120 --> 07:30.280
Okay.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.120
Well, we at least have to tell Louis.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.240
I don't think we should do that.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.760
Look at what they did to Brooke
just to make sure she wouldn't talk.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.680
-We can't just keep this to ourselves.
-I agree with him, Hayley.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.600
[knocking at door]

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Who is it?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.120
[sighs]

07:52.880 --> 07:55.000
-Why are all the Ravens here?
-They're with us.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.440
-Brooke's awake.
-The spiral worked?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.520
-[Hayley] Sort of.
-We don't have time to explain all that.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.400
-We're about to go tell Louis everything.
-Wait! I don't think you should do that.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.520
Why?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.840
We're not sure we can trust him.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.920
What are you talking about?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.840
There's things you don't know about
that include your brother.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.600
Have you lost your mind?
I just spoke with Louis. He's devastated.

08:24.680 --> 08:27.160
-Is this your idea of laying low?
-I didn't have a choice.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.640
What was so urgent?

08:28.720 --> 08:31.400
You keep putting pressure
on me to step it up,

08:31.480 --> 08:32.640
Louis keeps asking me for errands,

08:32.720 --> 08:34.679
and I'm running around
like a rat in a maze!

08:34.760 --> 08:37.280
So you just left?
I mean, what were you thinking?

08:37.360 --> 08:40.640
Because this is what we need right now,
to have Louis fishing around.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.320
Look, we are so close,
and you're about to jeopardize everything.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.560
I... I can't take this pressure anymore.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.760
Grow up. I'm tired of your whining.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.880
We have a job to finish.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.320
And now I've gotta clean up your mess.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.080
And find another place to put your stuff.
I can't stand all this clutter.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.600
No way. I know my brother.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.000
Look, he's not perfect,
but he's not a criminal.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.400
Daniel felt the same way about his mom.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.160
-What do you think Jason wanted from Emma?
-We're not sure.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.080
But we think there was a clue
in Emma's chess set.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.800
-What?
-She left a clue for Max in her letter.

09:25.880 --> 09:30.360
She called him her "white knight."
"Knight," as in chess.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.640
We may not be Ravens,
but we know what chess is.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.440
Anyway, Jason took it from her locker.

09:35.520 --> 09:38.680
He told us he sent it back to her,
but we found out he didn't.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.880
This might be our best lead.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.400
[Louie ringing]

09:47.680 --> 09:49.200
It's my mother.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.320
[stutters] I can't bring myself
to talk to her.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.480
[Louie ringing]

09:55.200 --> 09:57.680
-Now she's calling me.
-Don't answer it.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.920
Brooke, you have to pick it up.
Don't you see this is our only advantage?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.200
-What advantage?
-Judy doesn't know we dehypnotized Brooke.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.200
So you want Brooke to just keep acting
around my mom like nothing happened?

10:08.280 --> 10:10.080
This is the only way
we can figure out what they're doing

10:10.160 --> 10:11.240
without raising their suspicion.

10:11.320 --> 10:13.160
[sighs] No way. Absolutely not.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.880
Do you have a better idea?
I would love to hear it.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.360
Hello? Hi, Judy.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.760
Yeah, we'll be there. Thanks.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.840
-She invited us to dinner.
-And you said yes?

10:27.480 --> 10:30.160
Hayley's right.
Right now, this is our only weapon.

10:30.240 --> 10:32.920
And if Emma's chess set is there,
we'll find it.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.720
He was always a strange man.

10:44.480 --> 10:47.360
If I was to tell you how I met him,
you'd think I was the strange one.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.320
Maybe I'm too naive, Judy.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.440
No, don't be so hard on yourself.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.600
At least I know
there's one person I can trust.

11:01.640 --> 11:02.920
Thank you, Judy.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.800
Hmm.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.440
The most important thing
is to make sure Judy suspects nothing.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.360
You must behave
as if she still controls your mind.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.400
And don't ask too many questions.
She will get suspicious.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.440
Okay.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.120
Okay. We should split up.
We don't wanna attract any attention.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.760
I mean, Jason or Louis
see us all hanging out together,

11:22.840 --> 11:24.040
it'll raise red flags for them.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.080
So we have to act
like we can't stand each other?

11:27.160 --> 11:28.360
Shouldn't be too hard.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.600
[sighs] Okay. So we should go now.

11:37.680 --> 11:42.160
Actually, you and Hayley go instead.
I'll wait here and go last.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.280
Are you sure?

11:44.320 --> 11:45.320
Okay.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.680
Hey, are you sure you can handle this?

11:52.760 --> 11:54.480
'Cause you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.880
I know. I want to.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.000
Uh, thanks, Hayley.

12:12.840 --> 12:15.040
[door opens and closes]

12:29.800 --> 12:31.280
[crying]

12:32.000 --> 12:35.520
You saved her. She'll never forget that.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.880
She'll never forget she was only with me
because my mom hypnotized her.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.760
Yeah, but she can't blame you for that.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.200
You did everything you could
once you realized something was wrong.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.440
[sighs] You know,
maybe it's too bad I realized.

12:50.720 --> 12:54.640
Really? You would rather
stay with her in that condition?

12:54.720 --> 12:59.280
[sighs] Of course not,
but I'd also rather not know my mom...

13:01.160 --> 13:02.960
How could she do that to her?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.120
I mean, your mom was a wonderful woman
and a hero, and she's dead.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.680
My mom is alive and well,
and I can't even look at her in the eye.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.960
[sighs]

13:16.800 --> 13:20.080
You'll be okay, won't you?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.680
[inhales deeply]
I just wanna know what's going on.

13:27.400 --> 13:28.440
Me too.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.160
[chuckles] You know,

13:32.240 --> 13:36.200
with the Eagles' winning attitude
and the Ravens' strategic thinking,

13:36.280 --> 13:38.280
we make a pretty good team.

13:39.480 --> 13:40.560
[chuckles]

13:46.480 --> 13:47.880
[knocking at door]

13:50.080 --> 13:52.480
-Who is it?
-[Aspen] It's me.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.080
-I'm busy.
-[Aspen] Let me in, Lee!

13:56.160 --> 13:57.920
Please go! I don't wanna see you!

13:58.000 --> 14:00.360
I don't want anything to do with you!
Can't you get that?

14:13.840 --> 14:15.400
[knocking at door]

14:15.480 --> 14:17.280
[sighs] Why can't she let it go?

14:18.520 --> 14:20.520
[knocking continues]

14:24.080 --> 14:25.080
Hey.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.560
[Sophie laughs]

14:28.400 --> 14:30.000
-You're gonna get there! Yeah!
-Ah!

14:30.080 --> 14:33.680
-[laughing] Whoo! I'm out of breath.
-Whoo!

14:33.760 --> 14:35.160
How fast?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.760
Eight minutes per mile. Not bad.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.880
All right, nice. But next time,
I'm not gonna go that easy on you.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.720
-Oh, okay.
-[laughs]

14:45.040 --> 14:47.520
Oh, man,
gotta hand it to those endorphins.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.800
Right?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.240
Thanks for dragging me out here.

14:53.320 --> 14:58.640
Well, thank you for standing by my side
when Parker and everybody shut me out.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.040
It was nice of you.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.480
You did the same thing for me
when I first came here.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.440
You were my first friend
when I came to the Eagles.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.800
I'm glad I was.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.800
[chuckles]

15:19.560 --> 15:20.920
You okay?

15:24.320 --> 15:28.080
Hey. Alex, can we talk?

15:29.240 --> 15:30.560
[Alex] Yeah. Sure.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.760
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.280
Look, Leo, I know
I've been mean to you lately,

15:52.360 --> 15:53.840
and I know I keep avoiding you.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.920
The last time you agreed to be with me,
we nearly drowned.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.080
Yeah, I know. And I never thanked you
for jumping in to save me.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.240
You don't need to.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.720
So anyway, about what you saw.
It really wasn't--

16:10.800 --> 16:14.360
Okay, look, I really don't wanna
talk about it, so, um...

16:15.120 --> 16:18.400
Leo, listen.
Daniel and I aren't actually together.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.840
Really?

16:24.160 --> 16:27.880
It's a long story,
but we had to pretend to be a couple

16:27.960 --> 16:30.680
so no one would figure out
what we were really up to.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.720
What were you up to?

16:34.560 --> 16:37.560
It's a secret.
But I'm gonna tell you anyway.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.920
[chuckles]

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
So, is it April 1 yet?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.160
No, silly.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.800
But no one else can know about this, Alex.

16:48.880 --> 16:51.160
Not until we find out
what Judy's been up to.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.880
So she still thinks
you're working for her.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.560
Brilliant.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.560
It was your sister's idea.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.120
[chuckles]

17:01.200 --> 17:04.160
No one can know about this, Leo,
but I had to tell you the truth.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.079
-I couldn't keep this from you any longer.
-Why not go to the police?

17:08.160 --> 17:11.079
I wanted to, at first.
But my dad's an FBI agent,

17:11.160 --> 17:13.359
so I know from his experience
that without any proof,

17:13.440 --> 17:15.359
no one will take us seriously.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.560
Well, you know something's going on
near the cave.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.760
We could send police to investigate,
and we could figure--

17:19.839 --> 17:23.240
No, it's too risky.
We don't know who else is involved.

17:23.960 --> 17:24.960
Involved in what?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.560
That's what we're trying to figure out.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.840
So now what?

17:33.320 --> 17:35.480
Now I have to go to my dad's for dinner,

17:35.560 --> 17:38.000
pretending like I'm
still working for Judy.

17:42.760 --> 17:45.720
You know, I remember
what happened between us.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.320
Before everything else that happened.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.040
So you remember the time
we got married in Vegas?

17:54.120 --> 17:55.560
[giggles]

17:56.920 --> 17:59.520
I remember I had fun hanging out with you.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.600
I remember it too.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.320
-[doorbell rings]
-Oh. I'll get that.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.560
Oh! Look who it is.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.000
[chuckles] Aw, you guys look so cute.
I can't take it.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.400
Hey.
[kisses] Mmm.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.320
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, Mom.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.840
-Mmm. All right.
-[Daniel sighs]

19:22.280 --> 19:23.920
[muffled grunting]
