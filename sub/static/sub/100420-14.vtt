WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:11.845
And that's the end of a sexist,
fatphobic anecdote

00:11.928 --> 00:13.930
in which I was so desperate
to get out of the rain,

00:14.014 --> 00:17.559
-I slept with a plus-sized woman.

00:17.642 --> 00:18.935
Hold the door.

00:19.477 --> 00:22.105
-Oh! Did I miss a meeting?
-No, Angela.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.358
We took Davey here out
for a big '90s-style birthday party,

00:25.442 --> 00:26.735
it being the '90s and all...

00:26.818 --> 00:30.030
I would have come!
I love the '90s, and it being them.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.450
Come on, the president of the network
shouldn't fraternize with the board.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.952
Let your number two handle that stuff.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.666
I don't like you going to birthday parties
behind my back, Teddy.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.418
I was doing reconnaissance for you!

00:43.501 --> 00:44.502
You didn't hear it from me,

00:44.586 --> 00:47.297
but there's some concern
that as a single career gal, you're,

00:47.380 --> 00:49.507
-well, a single career gal.
-And?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.926
ABC's supposed to be
a family network.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.179
I understand families.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.555
Uh-huh.

00:55.638 --> 00:56.473
Does he?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.018
Oh, Herb.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.563
I'm sorry, okay?

01:03.730 --> 01:05.065
It's called discretion, Herb.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.233
We're trying to sell
the network to Disney.

01:07.317 --> 01:10.445
Disney? You think Michael Eisner
gives a hoot who I go to bed with?

01:10.528 --> 01:12.697
We don't need to bring Eisner into this.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.991
Obviously,
Michael Eisner is a compassionate

01:15.075 --> 01:16.659
and progressive individual.

01:16.743 --> 01:17.952
This isn't about him.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.580
-So, it's you. Just say it's you.
-No. You're the one--

01:20.663 --> 01:23.166
If you're going to fire me,
at least have the balls to fire me.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.793
-You're fired.
-Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.586
You think you can do
"Horsin' Around" without me?

01:26.669 --> 01:29.130
We could do it without anybody.
All we need is the horse.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.509
And that horse is just gonna go along
with you canning his best friend?

01:32.592 --> 01:36.096
You want BoJack to betray me,
you're gonna need one hell of a pitch.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.139
Okay.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.995
-Mr. Horseman, you're invited to set?
-Thank you.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.747
-The set of "Horny Unicorn"?
-Yes, I'm aware.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.708
To shoot a scene
in which the titular horny unicorn

02:46.791 --> 02:48.209
gets his penis stuck in a saxophone,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.336
because he was hoping to "get blown"?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.046
I know the scene, thank you.

02:56.676 --> 02:57.594
Ah.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.347
Hello?

03:01.431 --> 03:04.142
<i>-BoJack, this is Angela Diaz.</i>
-Huh?

03:04.225 --> 03:05.393
<i>We met once before.</i>

03:09.355 --> 03:10.273
I remember.

03:10.356 --> 03:15.069
I saw your interview several months back.
It made me nostalgic.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.822
Me too. Nostalgic for the day
before I did the interview.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.741
Oh, yes, humor.

03:19.824 --> 03:24.120
If you're free tonight, you could come by
the house, watch the fire, reminisce.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.164
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.917
-What?
-<i>Wouldn't you love to find out?</i>

03:29.000 --> 03:30.793
Uh...

03:33.671 --> 03:37.300
So, the Stephen King musical opened
right next door to the Sondheim revival.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.385
We have clients in both.
I was worried there'd be tension,

03:39.469 --> 03:41.846
but it turns out <i>Misery</i> loves <i>Company.</i>

03:41.930 --> 03:43.514
Judah, are you in a band?

03:43.598 --> 03:44.557
Why do you ask that?

03:44.641 --> 03:47.435
I've always wondered if you were in a band
ever since this afternoon

03:47.518 --> 03:49.979
when I overheard Juniper tell Stuart
that you were in a band.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.190
You're playing a gig tonight,
and the whole office is going.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.776
I was planning to invite you,
but didn't want you to feel obligated.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.736
-We're not good.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.738
Lenny! How the shell are you?

03:58.821 --> 03:59.864
I got trouble, PC!

03:59.989 --> 04:01.866
You know Teddy Buttons,
my head of production?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.576
I'm familiar with Teddy.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.455
I somehow missed that Teddy has spent
the last 20 years showing women his...

04:07.538 --> 04:09.165
I'm familiar.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.792
See, that's why I love you.
You're discreet.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.962
-You're tough. You're Teflon.
-That's me, an old frying pan.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.172
I could use someone who can
handle the heat over here.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.676
Someone who can be more
professional and less... Moonves.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.010
What are you saying?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.931
I want you to run Turteltaub's
new female-focused studio division,

04:25.014 --> 04:26.683
-Girtletaub!
-I didn't sneeze.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.060
No, Girtletaub is the studio.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.521
I wanna announce a slate
before the Teddy story hits the trades.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.981
You think you can throw one together?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.900
You want me to pitch
my dream movie studio?

04:35.984 --> 04:38.403
<i>I need it tomorrow morning. We gotta hit</i>
<i>the ground running with this thing.</i>

04:38.528 --> 04:40.697
You don't wanna
go slow and steady?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.448
-What am I, a tortoise?

04:43.449 --> 04:44.367
Hmm.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.576
Get me box office numbers.

04:45.660 --> 04:47.704
We need firm financial figures to frame

04:47.787 --> 04:50.123
how fans flock
to flicks that flex chicks,

04:50.206 --> 04:53.209
woman films,
like <i>Pretty, Wonder, Little.</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:54.961
<i>Diary of a Mad Black.</i>
I'll get my laptop.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.462
Oh, wait! Your gig.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.216
I have time. This is important.
<i>When a Man Loves a...</i>

05:00.466 --> 05:01.759
-What?
-That's another film title,

05:01.843 --> 05:03.177
as we were discussing previously.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.887
Oh, of course.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.309
Mm.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.565
-Hey, Guy, I'm about to...
<i>-Diane.</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:18.901
Am I wearing a T-shirt right now that says
"Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"?

05:18.985 --> 05:21.738
I can't see you right now,
but I'm guessing by your tone, no?

05:21.863 --> 05:24.615
Then why is my ex-wife treating me
like I'm some kind of asshole?

05:24.741 --> 05:26.284
Did you tell her
you weren't wearing the shirt?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.910
Lady got a job in Houston.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.413
She's taking Sonny out of school
and moving to Texas.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.497
She can't do that!

05:31.581 --> 05:33.791
Well, she can,
because she has full custody.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.836
And this is her dream job, and I'm really
happy for her. But this sucks!

05:36.919 --> 05:42.008
Well, they must need cameramen
in Houston, and I can write anywhere...

05:42.091 --> 05:44.177
I... couldn't ask you to do that.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.678
I wouldn't ask you to ask.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.931
If Sonny's going to Houston,
then we're going.

05:49.015 --> 05:53.102
Okay. Okay. All right. Houston.
Uh, g-go, Astros!

05:53.186 --> 05:54.562
Go... rodeos!

05:54.645 --> 05:55.813
Hope you like barbecue!

05:55.897 --> 05:59.650
I hope I don't need another abortion
because they are hard to get there!

05:59.734 --> 06:01.861
-Wait, what?
-Just trying to think of Texas things.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.780
Sorry. Houston!

06:06.157 --> 06:09.285
All day at the airport,
I watch people pull suitcases.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.746
Why do we suffer
that extra weight dragging us down?

06:11.829 --> 06:13.206
Because we need clean clothes.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.124
The point is: helium luggage.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.794
Why pack light
when you can pack lighter than air?

06:17.877 --> 06:21.172
All right, so Mom's too sick
to come out of her room

06:21.255 --> 06:23.883
but not too sick
to make her famous Frito pie?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.134
Well, she wanted to see you.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.845
She was fine all day
and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.055
I wanna see her.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.141
No, no, no, no, she's not there!
She's at the Zumba.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.935
Is she at Zumba or is she sick?

06:34.018 --> 06:37.313
She is sick but was hoping
the Afro-Latin fusion beats

06:37.397 --> 06:39.232
-would make her feel better.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.900
This was a mistake.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.820
- Hmm.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.033
Todd, I must confess to you,
your mother is not at Zumba.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.701
I can see her in the window.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.871
Oh! That's a mannequin
so I can test out my outfits.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.416
-You're lying again!

06:56.499 --> 07:00.128
Okay. She didn't come to dinner
because she's ashamed.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.839
She can't say hello?
The woman has my kidney!

07:02.922 --> 07:04.590
And that's why she's ashamed.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.218
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.

07:07.301 --> 07:10.596
If she could turn it around somehow,
save your life...

07:10.680 --> 07:12.765
-But, alas, she cannot.
-Huh.

07:12.849 --> 07:17.103
But maybe if she could...
but no, you’re obviously healthy.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.147
-But if you weren't...

07:19.230 --> 07:20.106
-But you are.
-Hmm.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.443
-Clearly there is nothing to be done.
-Hmm.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.243
Ugh.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.501
- <i>Hey.</i>
-Wha--

07:40.668 --> 07:43.045
<i>Aren't you the horse</i>
<i>from "Horsin' Around"?</i>

07:43.421 --> 07:45.715
Mm.

07:50.261 --> 07:54.140
Look at this thing.
I fell down one time and I'm an invalid.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.935
-Word to the wise, BoJack, don't get old.
-I'll see what I can do about that.

07:58.102 --> 08:01.647
My 40-year-old companion
treats me like a fragile antique.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.817
I've got a Lamborghini Miura
and she won't even let me drive it.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.985
I'm sorry to hear that.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.113
Anyway, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.490
Uh...

08:10.573 --> 08:11.407
Yeah?

08:11.491 --> 08:16.537
I'm sorry that at the '94 upfronts
we made you do that stupid BoJack dance.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.540
Oh. Is that why you wanted
to see me tonight?

08:19.624 --> 08:22.960
No. You're tall.
I need you to reach a box.

08:25.421 --> 08:29.592
"Melanie, good luck with your braces.
I think they look cool."

08:32.345 --> 08:33.221
Huh?

08:34.013 --> 08:35.640
Mr. Peanutbutter?

08:37.350 --> 08:38.226
Oh.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.395
Uh...

08:41.979 --> 08:44.440
<i>-♪ Who's that dog? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ Mr. Peanutbutter! ♪</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:47.193
-Diane!
-You wrote a memoir?

08:47.276 --> 08:51.405
Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago,
then one weekend it just fell out of me.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.533
-What?
<i>-From the way people talk about writing,</i>

08:53.616 --> 08:55.743
I always assumed it was very difficult,

08:55.826 --> 08:59.038
but it turns out it's not at all,
literally anyone can do it!

08:59.121 --> 09:01.791
Yes, that's always been my experience.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.793
I loved your new book, by the way.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.962
-Thanks.
<i>-I'm happy for you, Diane.</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:07.755
Even though it's really easy
to write a book,

09:07.838 --> 09:10.299
it's still an accomplishment
to be proud of.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.385
-I am.
<i>-And how's Chicago?</i>

09:12.468 --> 09:15.388
Are you a Chicagoan yet?
You know, I went to school in Chicago.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.266
You went to Northwestern.
That's not in Chicago.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.268
Ah! You <i>are</i> a Chicagoan!

09:20.351 --> 09:23.145
I'm actually about to move to Houston.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.357
In New York? Oh, I think there
they pronounce it "Hose-town."

09:26.440 --> 09:29.819
No, Texas. My boyfriend and I are going.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.697
Oh, wow! Boyfriend.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.157
-Yeah.
-That's fantastic.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.244
I wanna hear all about him.
I assume he's a good guy?

09:38.327 --> 09:40.997
He's actually the best Guy.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.627
His girlfriend looks nice.
He seems healthy.

09:46.711 --> 09:47.753
What-- What's his job?

09:47.878 --> 09:49.171
I think he runs a daycare,

09:49.255 --> 09:52.008
but he talks about the babies
as if they're his co-workers,

09:52.091 --> 09:54.385
so it's impossible to know for sure.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.554
-I should have been there.
-We'll try again.

09:56.637 --> 09:57.638
-Oh!

09:59.640 --> 10:01.517
-Hello?
- <i>Listen up, Helen.</i>

10:01.601 --> 10:04.353
<i>I've kidnapped your son</i>
<i>and I demand a ransom or I will--</i>

10:04.937 --> 10:06.355
- Next card?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.273
"Murder him!"

10:07.481 --> 10:10.901
Oh, no! Todd's gonna get murdered
by a fearsome stranger

10:10.985 --> 10:14.697
whose sage, buttery voice simultaneously
comforts me and fills me with dread.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.699
Sounds like a lot of range
for a kidnapper.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.743
Who are you and what do you want?

10:18.826 --> 10:24.874
"I'm your worst nightmare and I want
one hundred of your famous Frito pies."

10:24.957 --> 10:26.500
Yes. Anything!

10:26.584 --> 10:29.754
"Under the Hyperion Street Bridge
in one hour."

10:29.837 --> 10:32.256
That was perfect! Thank you, Margo!

10:32.340 --> 10:33.758
It's the least I can do.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.135
Getting you to buy
that addictive video game

10:36.218 --> 10:40.640
was the act that set me down
this ruinous path so many years ago.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.725
If I can make things right by you,

10:42.808 --> 10:46.187
maybe there's hope yet
for this wretched soul.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.606
Okay!

10:54.570 --> 10:55.404
Open it.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.033
-Whoa.
-The studio went all-out.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.577
They even found your original screen test.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.745
That's incredible.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.538
Too bad no one will ever see it.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.333
After your interview,
we couldn't give these things away.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.168
Oh, right. Sure.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.920
It was a great show.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.673
It would be a shame
for it to be forgotten now.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.965
Maybe it's for the best.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.302
I just feel so bad for Sarah Lynn.
She was so good.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.805
It's tragic
she won't be remembered for it.

11:20.888 --> 11:23.057
Well, nothing we can do
about it now, right?

11:29.355 --> 11:31.982
I've completed a projection
for female-led films over five years.

11:32.066 --> 11:35.695
It's encouraging but vague until I get
the specifics of your dream slate.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.739
I don't know what that is!
I don't remember my dreams.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.242
Did I ever even have dreams?

11:41.325 --> 11:44.161
If you leave now,
you can still make your show.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.705
My job is to be here when you are.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.624
No. Don't give your whole life
to this job,

11:48.708 --> 11:52.294
because if you do, someday someone
will finally ask you what you want

11:52.378 --> 11:55.548
and you'll realize
you don't even know anymore.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.384
-Okay.
-I'm sorry to miss it.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.970
You missing it
will make eye contact easier tomorrow.

12:06.183 --> 12:09.854
Gronkle has been re-cutting
old episodes of <i>The Cosby Show</i>

12:09.937 --> 12:12.273
to take out all the Cosby scenes.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.358
-They call it "The Show."
-Huh.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.361
They wanna try something similar
with "Horsin' Around."

12:17.445 --> 12:19.363
So, it'll just be "Around"?

12:19.447 --> 12:22.116
It'll just be around eight minutes
an episode,

12:22.199 --> 12:25.828
which is perfect
for today's ADD-addled youth.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.205
It's about three precocious orphans

12:28.289 --> 12:30.207
living without any adult supervision,

12:30.291 --> 12:33.878
who learn that wisdom and guidance
can be found everywhere.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.421
It's all "around."

12:37.006 --> 12:39.633
Well, sounds like
you got it all figured out.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.594
-What do you need me for?
-Your backend.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.012
Nobody's going to watch the show

12:43.095 --> 12:44.889
if they think
you're still profiting off it.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.017
-I need that money now more than ever.
-We want to buy you out.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.687
A one-time payment and then
you're divorced from the show forever.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.566
Oof.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.527
Do it for Sarah Lynn.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.571
Doesn't she deserve more

13:00.654 --> 13:03.240
than to be remembered
as the girl you killed?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.203
Have you seen the episodes
without me in them?

13:07.286 --> 13:08.829
-Mm-hmm.
-And they're good?

13:08.913 --> 13:12.958
If you sign that document, you won't need
to worry about that ever again.

13:18.589 --> 13:21.550
Good, let's drink.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.927
I'm fine with my water, thanks.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.387
You're not fooling anyone
with that water bottle.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.057
Let me fix you a real drink.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.433
One.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.815
Wow, this is a huge crowd for us.
Is everyone from your office here?

13:37.107 --> 13:38.192
Not everyone.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.654
Judah, obviously
I was speaking figuratively.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.264
Hi, we are
Spectrum of Enchantment.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.266
Our lead singer had to go back to work...

14:10.349 --> 14:11.600
-What?
-...so we'll be playing

14:11.684 --> 14:15.771
all of the instrumental
versions of our songs. So...

14:15.855 --> 14:17.189
Whoo!

14:17.273 --> 14:20.067
-Instrumentals!

14:22.027 --> 14:24.280
<i>♪ Now boys and girls</i>
<i>If you wanna do the BoJack ♪</i>

14:24.363 --> 14:26.407
<i>♪ Take your hands</i>
<i>Put them up on your lower back ♪</i>

14:26.490 --> 14:30.077
<i>♪ Take your circle and strut and strut</i>
<i> Wiggle your hips and jiggle your... ♪</i>

14:30.160 --> 14:31.161
-Uh-oh!
-Whoo!

14:31.245 --> 14:34.665
<i>♪ ...troubles and pull up your pants</i>
<i>That's how you do the BoJack dance! ♪</i>

14:35.749 --> 14:37.042
-Brilliant!

14:37.126 --> 14:40.671
Yeah, but no one wants
to do the BoJack now.

14:40.880 --> 14:45.134
It's funny. I remember a time
when I was scared you'd leave the show.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.261
Who'd have thought
one day I'd be asking you to?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.015
When were you scared
that I'd leave the show?

14:51.098 --> 14:54.351
Oh, Herb was gay and I had to convince you
to let us fire him.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.563
-Let you?
-You probably don't even remember,

14:57.646 --> 15:00.649
but I had this whole speech
I practiced in the mirror.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.402
I was terrified
you were going to call my bluff.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.196
Bluff? All this time, I thought
there was nothing I could have done...

15:06.280 --> 15:08.115
I guess I bluffed good!

15:08.198 --> 15:11.535
-I'm not taking your stupid deal.
-No! You signed!

15:12.828 --> 15:15.039
-Stop, you idiot!
-No.

15:15.122 --> 15:18.375
No! Why should I give you what you want?
You took everything from me.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.045
My job was on the line.
You have no idea--

15:21.128 --> 15:24.965
Every stupid decision I made,
every bad thing that has ever happened,

15:25.049 --> 15:27.551
-it all started because of you.
-Grow up.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.221
You play these games, "if I hadn't
done this, if I wasn't so that,"

15:31.305 --> 15:33.766
but you did and you were and here we are.

15:33.849 --> 15:34.850
I can't... I...

15:34.934 --> 15:38.354
Here we are!
Because we did what we had to do.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.398
So, what do you have to do now?

15:45.861 --> 15:47.696
Oh, God.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.740
That's right.

15:49.823 --> 15:52.284
Now, another drink?

16:02.127 --> 16:03.754
Please! Don't hurt him!

16:03.837 --> 16:06.757
-Boy dies if you don't got the pies.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.634
We have them. Jorge? Go! Go!

16:10.260 --> 16:13.222
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!
We should have boxed them!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.766
- No!

16:15.849 --> 16:19.103
Please don't hurt him.
I never got to make it right.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.312
I've ruined my chance...

16:20.396 --> 16:22.898
Spare me the deets.
I just want the freets.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.942
-Frito pies, that is.
-Oh!

16:25.025 --> 16:28.112
No! Stop!

16:28.195 --> 16:29.947
-Mom! Mom!
-Helen? Are you all right?

16:30.030 --> 16:33.325
It's okay. It's not real. I'm fine!
It's a classic Todd shenanigan!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.452
But how would you know what that is?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.329
I think my wife is having a heart attack.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.164
That's Margo Martindale, the actress!

16:39.248 --> 16:40.457
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

16:40.541 --> 16:45.045
I was too convincing!
Oh, if only I wasn't so good at acting!

16:49.299 --> 16:52.469
It's funny, isn't it?
The things that matter?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.513
The truth is none of it matters

16:54.596 --> 16:58.017
and the truth is it all matters
tremendously.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.061
It's a wonder any of us
ever get out of bed at all.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.772
And yet, we get out of bed.

17:04.565 --> 17:05.733
I'm going home.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.529
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking your car.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.072
-What?
-You're not using it.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.659
Someone should get some pleasure out
of something in this sad, stupid world.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.994
Consider it a signing bonus.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.162
Ugh.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.371
And I'm taking these.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.005
But the lazy Susans
turned out to be very problematic.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.340
-Why?
-<i>Offensive to Susans.</i>

17:30.424 --> 17:33.469
There was a protest
organized by Susan Sarandon.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.678
Oh, no!

17:34.762 --> 17:37.848
Not that many Susans showed up.
You know what they say about Susans.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.516
They're lazy?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.226
Suddenly you're desperately seeking them.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.104
Anyway, I don't know
how we got talking about me for so long.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.106
You were gonna tell me
about your boyfriend. It's good?

17:46.190 --> 17:48.317
It's really good. When I'm with him,

17:48.400 --> 17:50.444
I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?

17:50.527 --> 17:54.615
Like, every other relationship, I always
felt like a "me" in a relationship.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.574
Does that make sense?

17:55.657 --> 17:57.868
Uh, yeah. That makes sense.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.412
Sorry. I-I didn't realize
I was doing that.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.206
I've always tried to be
an "us" with people

18:02.289 --> 18:04.458
even when I could see
it wasn't a good idea.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.711
Now that I'm single, I feel like
I'm finally learning how to be a "me."

18:07.795 --> 18:08.629
That's great.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.923
<i>I know there were times you would</i>
<i>try to tell me something</i>

18:11.006 --> 18:12.800
and instead of listening,
I just tried to fix it

18:12.883 --> 18:14.676
or convince you there wasn't a problem.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.678
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

18:16.887 --> 18:18.472
We're all doing our best.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.849
<i>-I wanna know now.</i>
-Know what?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.185
Tell me what it's like to be Diane.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.438
Okay. When you're Diane,

18:26.522 --> 18:31.360
you can live your whole life
like it's a puzzle,

18:31.443 --> 18:34.071
put together
from the pieces of different sets.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.240
Like a crossover puzzle?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.616
Exactly.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.702
Your whole life is full
of these pieces that don't quite fit.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.079
Sounds like a hard puzzle.

18:42.246 --> 18:45.040
But at some point,
you start to think it's you.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.377
<i>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</i>

18:49.503 --> 18:55.217
<i>And you spend so long with that feeling</i>
<i>that the feeling becomes your home.</i>

18:55.884 --> 18:58.095
And it can be jarring
when you discover one day

18:58.178 --> 19:01.140
that you suddenly
don't feel that way anymore.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.308
At first, you don't trust it.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.854
But then, gradually, you do.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.565
I'm sorry. That was a weird thing
to be telling my ex-husband.

19:09.648 --> 19:10.732
No.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.652
-I'm really happy for you, Diane.
<i>-It's funny.</i>

19:14.444 --> 19:17.656
I feel like if we met each other
as the people we are now,

19:17.781 --> 19:19.616
things would be totally different with us.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.703
Yeah, but if we hadn't met
each other until now,

19:22.786 --> 19:25.164
we wouldn't be the people we are now.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.166
Yeah.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.252
Two equally accomplished book writers.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.588
Uh-huh.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.176
You suffered an anxiety attack.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.305
I'd encourage you to avoid
stressful situations like, uh,

19:41.388 --> 19:44.016
fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.475
Okay, paperwork time.

19:45.559 --> 19:49.062
You seem like a fellow who enjoys
unnecessary bureaucracy.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.606
I do, Doctor.

19:51.481 --> 19:55.235
Mm, was that the bridge
where they shot <i>Grease?</i>

19:55.319 --> 19:57.362
-Yeah!
-That's neat.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.324
Todd, I'm so sorry!

20:00.407 --> 20:02.576
Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--

20:02.659 --> 20:05.412
I thought kicking you out
was the right thing.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.123
You were 18.
You had dropped out of high school.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.500
You were always high.
You only wore flip-flops.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.961
-You never showered.
-You don't have to list everything.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.423
I wanted you to grow up,
not leave forever.

20:16.506 --> 20:19.968
Then more and more time passed
and I didn't know how to make it right.

20:20.052 --> 20:23.722
Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.

20:23.805 --> 20:28.435
I haven't had a mom for so long, I...
I don't really need one anymore.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.146
Oh. So, what do we do now?

20:31.230 --> 20:34.066
Well, I do have one idea.

20:34.149 --> 20:37.486
-What?
-A big robot suit like in <i>Aliens,</i>

20:37.569 --> 20:40.614
but for babies
so they can do grown-up things!

20:40.697 --> 20:45.244
-That sounds dangerous.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.080
But maybe the robots could be powered

20:48.163 --> 20:51.208
by energy generated
from sucking on pacifiers.

20:51.291 --> 20:57.005
That is so smart! Babies love sucking
and right now it's just wasted energy!

20:57.089 --> 21:00.759
And so you see,
the circle had become complete.

21:00.842 --> 21:05.055
All the twists and turns had all been
part of a beautiful tapestry,

21:05.138 --> 21:10.060
a grander mission to bring this boy
and his mother together again.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.730
That's quite a story.
But you've killed a lot of people.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.359
-Margo Martindale, you're going to pris--
- Wait!

21:18.235 --> 21:21.655
You can't send her to jail before
she gets to act in one of my movies!

21:21.738 --> 21:23.949
Indie filmmaker Nicole Holofcener?

21:24.032 --> 21:27.953
I find it hard to believe Margo Martindale
has never appeared in your work.

21:28.036 --> 21:31.540
It's true! And I need her to play
the mother of the poetry student

21:31.623 --> 21:35.627
Catherine Keener has an affair with
in my new film, "Classroom Warfare."

21:35.711 --> 21:38.255
Ooh! Can I, Mr. Judge? Please?

21:38.338 --> 21:41.258
Damn, that does sound good.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.468
Okay, you're free to go.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.013
Yee-haw!

21:51.268 --> 21:54.521
Come on. Open. Open! Open up!

21:54.604 --> 21:56.231
God. Where's my stupid...

21:59.401 --> 22:03.530
Why is everything so difficult?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.241
Have it your way, door.

22:07.576 --> 22:10.287
Todd! How come we never go swimming?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.081
This is terrible.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.626
Well, hello.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.297
Who put pills in my house?

22:27.763 --> 22:30.974
Judah, you were supposed to have
the night off! Your hair is so long!

22:31.058 --> 22:33.560
-I'd rather be here.

22:33.643 --> 22:34.770
I know.

22:35.062 --> 22:38.774
Would you think I was an idiot
if I didn't go work for Turteltaub?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.859
I would never think you were an idiot.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.737
This slate we're putting together...

22:43.820 --> 22:47.449
We could get some financiers
and do it ourselves, right?

22:47.532 --> 22:49.534
If there's one thing I know
about this business,

22:49.618 --> 22:52.704
it's never underestimate
what Princess Carolyn can do by herself.

22:52.788 --> 22:55.123
Well, not all by myself.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.625
Well...

22:56.708 --> 23:00.879
I've got the babysitter 'til 11:00.
We might as well keep working, right?

23:00.962 --> 23:04.174
-How can I help?
-Why don't you play me one of your songs?

We're gonna do that movie that you're
always making me watch. You know...

24:34.598 --> 24:37.642
You have to answer
for the chimpanzee, Tino.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.311
No, Mickey, you got it all wrong!

24:39.394 --> 24:41.688

24:41.771 --> 24:44.649
The chimp's dead, Tino. So's the bonobo.
