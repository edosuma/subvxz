<i>It all started when a time travel</i>
<i>experiment I was conducting... </i>

00:05.171 --> 00:08.106
<i>went... a little caca. </i>

00:09.542 --> 00:11.669
<i>In the blink of a cosmic clock,
I went from quantum physicist... </i>

00:11.745 --> 00:15.112
<i>... to air force test pilot,</i>

00:15.181 --> 00:18.582
<i>which could have been fun</i>
<i>if I knew how to fly. </i>

00:18.651 --> 00:21.916
<i>Fortunately, I had help,</i>
<i>an observer from the project named Al. </i>

00:21.988 --> 00:26.857
<i>Unfortunately, Al's a hologram,</i>
<i>so all he can lend is moral support. </i>

00:26.926 --> 00:29.918
<i>Anyway, here I am,</i>
<i>bouncing around in time,</i>

00:29.996 --> 00:32.089
<i>putting things right</i>
<i>that once went wrong</i>

00:32.165 --> 00:36.033
<i>a sort of time-traveling Lone Ranger</i>
<i>with Al as my Tonto,</i>

00:37.404 --> 00:39.565
<i>and I don't even need a mask. </i>

00:39.639 --> 00:41.573
Oh, boy.

<i>If the truth be
known, once I got into it,</i>

02:00.753 --> 02:02.516
<i>quantum leaping turned out
to be a lot of fun. </i>

02:02.589 --> 02:06.787
<i>So far, I've been able to save</i>
<i>two lives, one ball game and a pig. </i>

02:06.860 --> 02:09.624
<i>I fought for the faith of a nun</i>
<i>and against the mob,</i>

02:09.696 --> 02:14.633
<i>put together three couples, a father and
daughter and the lyrics to "Peggy Sue"</i>

02:14.701 --> 02:17.568
<i>Like I said, stepping into someone
else's shoes can be a lot of fun. </i>

02:17.637 --> 02:19.571
- B-8.
- Bingo.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.217
<i>Now all I have to figure out
is whose shoes I'm wearing... </i>

02:33.286 --> 02:36.050
<i>and the path I'm walking. </i>

02:36.122 --> 02:40.616
<i>But since I'm here and I'm hungry,
how about somethin' to eat?</i>

02:42.462 --> 02:44.953
Well!

03:07.787 --> 03:09.846
There's gotta be some mistake.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.891
Biggest mistake
you'll ever make, boy.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.189
Ain't that right, Toad?
Right as rain, Billy Joe.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.256
All right, you two, why
don't you just cut it out?

03:19.332 --> 03:22.392
I don't wanna spend the afternoon
cleanin'up blood, do I, Jesse?

03:23.603 --> 03:25.537
Uh, n-no, you don't.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.267
So why don't you just
take Miz Melny's lunch and get...

03:28.341 --> 03:31.037
before these boys lose
what little control they have?

03:31.110 --> 03:34.978
Miz Melny's, uh, lunch.
Yeah, right.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.575
Thanks.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.408
<i>I didn't know exactly where I was,</i>

04:12.485 --> 04:15.249
<i>but it was obviously too far South</i>
<i>to be a black man. </i>

04:15.321 --> 04:19.189
Jesse!
Jesse Tyler!

04:19.259 --> 04:21.317
You come over here
this instant.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.056
<i>Maybe all I'm here to do is... </i>

04:24.130 --> 04:26.530
<i>help a little old lady</i>
<i>across the street... </i>

04:26.599 --> 04:28.931
<i>or get her cat down</i>
<i>out of a tree... </i>

04:29.002 --> 04:30.993
<i>or deliver this lunch to</i>
Miz Melny.

04:31.070 --> 04:34.164
Jesse, it has got to be 100 degrees.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.606
You left me standin' here
in all this heat.

04:37.677 --> 04:42.273
I told you I was goin' to Sumter's
for five minutes. Five minutes...

04:42.348 --> 04:46.045
and all you had to do was
pick up my egg salad at Miz Patty's.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.950
I never did understand
why that salad was so good.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.618
<i>Why do I get the feeling</i>
<i>this isn't going to be a good day?</i>

04:54.894 --> 04:57.124
She wins at the county fair
every summer.

04:57.196 --> 04:59.562
I swear,
I don't understand why.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.124
- Excuse me. Miz Melny? Car's open.
- What?

05:03.202 --> 05:05.466
Well, I didn't leave you
standing outside in the heat,

05:05.538 --> 05:07.665
because the car door
was already open.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.198
Jesse, I have told you
a hundred times...

05:11.277 --> 05:13.336
to never leave my car
unlocked.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.440
Now start rollin' down
these windows.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.419
It is hotter than Tophet
in here...

05:21.487 --> 05:23.853
in my unlocked car.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.159
Thank you.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.566
What in tarnation
are you starin' at?

05:44.410 --> 05:46.776
I was just wonderin'
where we were going.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.714
I swear, Jesse. I'm the one
that's supposed to be old and senile.

05:50.783 --> 05:52.842
At least that's what
Clayton keeps tellin' me.

05:52.919 --> 05:56.946
Will you stop lookin' at me
like a lost sheep and drive.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.821
Miz Melny, you-you remember...

05:59.892 --> 06:01.883
when I fell down
and I bumped my head?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.930
Ever since then, I've had the
damndest time remembering things.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.364
First of all, Mr. Tyler,

06:08.434 --> 06:10.402
you watch your language
around me.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.938
Sorry, ma'am.
And secondly,

06:13.005 --> 06:15.701
you never told me a thing
about your head.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.743
And third...

06:19.812 --> 06:21.746
Third...

06:21.814 --> 06:25.045
You were gonna tell me where
we were going and how to get there.

06:25.118 --> 06:29.919
We are goin' where we have gone
every Saturday afternoon...

06:29.989 --> 06:33.755
for the last seven years,
to see Charles.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.795
To see Charles.
Oh, for heaven sakes.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.822
Make a left at Magnolia
and drive toward the hospital.

06:49.742 --> 06:53.610
<i>Of all the people I've leaped into,</i>
<i>Jesse should have been the strangest. </i>

06:53.679 --> 06:55.670
<i>But there was something</i>
<i>very comfortable about him... </i>

06:55.748 --> 06:58.114
<i>like putting on a pair</i>
<i>of your favorite shoes... </i>

06:58.184 --> 07:00.277
<i>or a jacket</i>
<i>you've broken in just right. </i>

07:01.487 --> 07:03.478
<i>So now that I've sort of</i>
<i>accepted being Jesse,</i>

07:03.556 --> 07:05.547
<i>I just have to figure out</i>
<i>what I'm here to do. </i>

07:07.160 --> 07:09.856
How long you gonna let
that turn signal blink?

07:09.929 --> 07:11.920
You made the turn
five minutes ago.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.989
I'm sorry.
I guess my mind was wandering.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.364
Well, just let your mind
wander in your car...

07:16.436 --> 07:19.405
and stop runnin' down
my batteries.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.463
Well, it doesn't run down
the batteries.

07:21.541 --> 07:24.305
See, they recharge...
Don't tell me about cars.

07:24.377 --> 07:27.744
My Charles told me quite a bit
about them and how they work,

07:27.814 --> 07:31.716
and I don't need you tellin' me
anything about my own car.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.979
Charles is your husband.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.453
Jesse, are you losin' your mind?

07:36.522 --> 07:38.922
Now mind my wheels
on the railroad tracks.

07:38.991 --> 07:41.289
Just turn in there.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.456
Yes, Miz Melny. Stop with all your
tomfoolery, or I'm gonna get all flustered.

07:45.531 --> 07:49.228
And I hate to visit Charles
when I get all flustered.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.237
Oh, look, Jesse.
It's all gone to seed.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.339
They're supposed
to take out all the weeds.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.738
They never keep the weeds away.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.053
They promised me, Jesse.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.386
They promised me that they
were going to clear these weeds.

08:12.458 --> 08:14.517
Here, let me do this.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.585
Miz Melny.

08:17.897 --> 08:20.991
Let me do this.
Oh.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.058
Sit down.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.995
There you go.

08:27.073 --> 08:30.406
Oh, now, see?
You got your gloves all dirty.

08:30.476 --> 08:33.967
I get so flustered...

08:35.381 --> 08:37.712
knowin' he's not
bein' taken care of.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.549
We always took
such good care of each other.

08:44.023 --> 08:47.618
In 50 years, that man
never let a bad thing happen.

08:49.562 --> 08:53.521
Well, we lost Beau,
but that wasn't his fault.

08:53.599 --> 08:57.126
As Charles said, the good Lord
needed that boy to come home.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.194
It's hard losing
somebody you love.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.708
Well, I guess you know
as much about that as I do.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.608
Your Sally lost four, didn't she?

09:07.113 --> 09:09.206
Yeah, I guess we did.

09:09.282 --> 09:12.809
Charles always thought highly
of your Sally.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.876
When she passed,
I remember him tellin' me...

09:14.954 --> 09:17.286
there wasn't a finer "niggra" woman...

09:17.356 --> 09:20.086
in all of Alabama.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.796
I'm just gonna, uh,

09:26.599 --> 09:28.590
just gonna throw these
in the trash.

09:39.011 --> 09:44.108
They didn't supply trash cans
in public places in the '50s.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.152
I'm tryin' to remember when they
started that "Pitch In" campaign.

09:47.219 --> 09:51.019
Must have been
the '70s or- Hi, Sam.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.081
Well?
Well, what?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.753
What do you think?
What do I think about what?

09:56.829 --> 09:59.263
I'm black.
You're black. So?

09:59.332 --> 10:03.735
So? If I can bounce into a black man,
the possibilities are limitless.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.794
Don't you find that fascinating?

10:05.871 --> 10:08.704
Dangerous, yes.
Fascinating? Mezzo mezzo.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.708
Dangerous? Why dangerous?

10:10.776 --> 10:14.109
You're a black man in the South
in 1955.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.842
Trust me. That is dangerous.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.214
I've seen things
that would curl your hair.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.219
No pun intended.

10:21.287 --> 10:25.747
I remember one time in Selma...
Yeah, Al, that's great. Listen, um...

10:25.825 --> 10:28.350
What did, uh...

10:28.427 --> 10:31.328
What did Ziggy say
I have to do to leap?

10:33.699 --> 10:37.658
Mrs. Melny Elizabeth
Charlotte Trafford...

10:37.737 --> 10:41.332
was killed when her car
was struck and demolished...

10:41.407 --> 10:43.841
by a passenger train at...

10:43.909 --> 10:47.072
that crossing,
tomorrow afternoon at 5:18.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.240
No.
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

10:50.316 --> 10:54.912
Ziggy's 86.7% certain
that you're here...

10:54.987 --> 10:58.013
to save Scarlet O'Hara there
from getting, uh,

10:58.090 --> 11:00.251
squished by a choo-choo.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.729
What about Jesse?
Was he squish...

11:05.865 --> 11:07.856
Was he killed too?

11:07.933 --> 11:11.494
No, Ziggy doesn't know. He's having
trouble finding any data on Jesse.

11:11.570 --> 11:14.835
Can't even find a birth certificate
or a death certificate.

11:14.907 --> 11:16.898
Great. I've replaced a man
who didn't exist.

11:16.976 --> 11:18.910
It's not uncommon for there
to be no records...

11:18.978 --> 11:22.141
for a Southern black man
in the '50s,

11:22.214 --> 11:25.706
especially in a little burg
like Red Dog.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.276
You know,

11:28.354 --> 11:31.221
I seem to recall that some
of the very first protests...

11:31.290 --> 11:34.054
started right- right near here.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.720
This might be where
Autherine Ruth came from.

11:36.796 --> 11:39.196
Who?
Autherine Ruth.

11:39.265 --> 11:43.031
She was the young black coed
that integrated the University of Alabama.

11:43.102 --> 11:45.627
How do you know
so much about this?

11:45.705 --> 11:49.732
A lot of my friends are black. I
don't believe you said that, Al.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.937
Well, it's true.
Besides, I was here.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.605
I went on the marches
and got arrested and beaten.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.245
Saw a lot of good people fall.

12:00.319 --> 12:03.015
Those were... powerful days.

12:03.089 --> 12:05.080
What if that's what
I'm here to do?

12:06.225 --> 12:09.456
What, get involved
in the Civil Rights movement?

12:09.528 --> 12:11.519
Uh-uh. No, Sam,
I don't think so.

12:11.597 --> 12:15.089
Why not?

12:15.167 --> 12:18.830
That's why you're here...

12:23.409 --> 12:25.775
to save Miz Melny from being killed
tomorrow afternoon...

12:25.845 --> 12:28.837
by the Alabama and Pacific.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.580
Now you be careful
with those clippin's, Jesse.

12:39.658 --> 12:41.956
Verbena Chilton gave me
that piece of jade tree...

12:42.027 --> 12:45.554
all the way from her sister's
in California.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.725
Though I don't know why anyone
would want to go to a place...

12:48.801 --> 12:52.134
as uncivilized as California.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.263
Jesse.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.140
Put that jade in some water
till it gets a chance to root.

12:59.578 --> 13:03.912
Clayton? You're early.
Supper's not till 6:00.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.508
I thought I'd come by
and have a little talk with Jesse.

13:06.585 --> 13:10.043
Not till he puts that jade
in water.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.147
What in heaven's name you want
to talk to Jesse about?

13:12.224 --> 13:14.454
Nothin' that you need
to fret about.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.893
We'll just talk
in the kitchen, Jesse.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.658
I guess you realize you
upset damn near the whole town

13:28.659 --> 13:30.436
with that little business
you pulled today.

13:30.509 --> 13:31.100
Business?

13:31.101 --> 13:32.875
Don't act dumb with me, Jesse.

13:32.945 --> 13:35.675
I talkin' about you sittin' down
at Miz Patty's today.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.916
Well, it was a lunch counter,
and I was hungry.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.319
So I... sat down to have some lunch. Lunch?

13:46.525 --> 13:49.824
Now, why would you do
anything so stupid?

13:49.895 --> 13:53.126
You got one of them uppity Northern
niggers stayin' with you, Jesse?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.768
No, I-I...

13:56.836 --> 13:58.895
I don't believe I do.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.963
Well, I can't
figure this out.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.032
I know you can't read,

14:04.109 --> 14:07.340
and you say you ain't got one of them
Northern niggers stayin' with you.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.973
How would you get such a
stupid notion in your head?

14:10.049 --> 14:12.040
Look, like I said,
I was hungry.

14:12.117 --> 14:15.348
Well, you take my advice, boy.
You don't get that hungry.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.661
Clayton, when you come back
for supper,

14:33.739 --> 14:36.071
bring me some buttermilk
from Mr. Sumter's.

14:37.343 --> 14:41.006
Mama, we have to talk.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.640
Whatever Jesse did at Miz Patty's,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.549
it don't make the least bit
of never mind to me.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.383
I swear, you got ears
like a hawk.

14:49.455 --> 14:52.117
I'm old, not dead.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.490
Now, Mama, you are the widow
of the governor of this state.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.587
Now, when your niggra
starts actin' uppity,

14:58.664 --> 15:01.098
people take notice of that.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.930
Clayton Sherwood Trafford.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.267
I don't need you
to lecture me.

15:06.338 --> 15:10.707
I know who I was married to, and I know
the responsibilities that go with it.

15:10.776 --> 15:12.710
Yes, Mama.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.941
But if Jesse steps out of bounds again,
are you gonna be responsible?

15:18.484 --> 15:20.475
Don't forget the buttermilk.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.200
Jesse!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.703
Are you all right?
Whoa. Whoa.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.270
Sit down. Sit down.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.509
Oh, I'm fine.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.644
It's just that Clayton
gets so riled and bothered...

15:55.721 --> 15:58.053
about things
that aren't his concern.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.114
I- It makes my head swell.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.183
Feelin' a little dizzy?

16:02.261 --> 16:04.593
Yes.
Watch my finger.

16:04.663 --> 16:07.723
What are you doin'? I'm just
checkin' to see if you're all right.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.325
Since when did you get
a medical degree?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.231
Well, I've done some doctoring
in my time.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.902
Well, I'll thank you to please keep
your colored voodoo to yourself.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.446
Now,

16:21.513 --> 16:25.574
if you'd be so kind as to go
and fetch me a glass of lemonade,

16:25.651 --> 16:27.642
I'll be just fine.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.337
Yes?
I'm so proud of you.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.805
You are?
With all my heart.

16:52.878 --> 16:55.438
<i>Where's my lemonade, Jesse?</i>

16:55.514 --> 16:57.675
That woman's
gonna run you ragged.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.378
She's not gonna keep you
late, is she? I don't know.

17:00.452 --> 17:03.444
Um, let me go take her this,
and I'll find out.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.455
Yeah.
Okay.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.194
- I'll be right... I'll be right back.
- Okay.

17:12.664 --> 17:15.462
Oh. That your Nell
come to fetch you home?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.468
Yeah, I guess so.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.834
I meant to get you on that leaky faucet.

17:19.905 --> 17:22.738
Keeps me awake all night.

17:22.808 --> 17:26.574
Well, you can get on it tomorrow,
first thing. You hear me?

17:26.645 --> 17:29.443
I'll do that.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.779
You sure you're okay?

17:31.850 --> 17:33.909
I mean, I-I don't like
leaving you alone.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.511
You let your granddaughter
take you home.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.613
Stop frettin' about me.

17:38.690 --> 17:42.592
Besides, Clayton's
comin' back for supper.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.761
Good night, Jesse.

17:45.831 --> 17:47.822
Good night, Miz Melny.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.412
- Well?
- Well, what?

18:03.482 --> 18:05.575
Oh, come on, Papa Jesse.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.812
All the white folks was
flappin' their skinny lips off...

18:07.886 --> 18:11.481
about you sittin' down
at Miz Patty's today.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.491
It certainly was
the talk of the town.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.027
So, what'd it feel like?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.960
Like sitting down to eat.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.991
It's about time somebody shook up
the white folks in this town,

18:24.069 --> 18:27.300
remind them what century
we're livin' in.

18:37.516 --> 18:40.280
I'm gonna sit at that counter
someday...

18:40.352 --> 18:42.411
and I'm gonna drink
from the white fountain and...

18:42.488 --> 18:44.479
and ride in the front of the bus...

18:44.556 --> 18:46.683
and do all the things
that make white folks mad.

18:47.826 --> 18:49.817
Is that why you wanna do it,
to make 'em mad?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.989
Yep, and 'cause it's right.

18:55.701 --> 18:58.329
You, uh- You always
drive so fast?

18:58.403 --> 19:02.066
Of course, Daddy would have a fit
if he knew I was goin'over 35.

19:02.141 --> 19:06.475
- But I gotta get you home early so you can cook.
- Cook?

19:06.545 --> 19:10.481
Papa Jesse, you goin'
senile on me?

19:10.549 --> 19:13.746
You know you promised to cook
chitlins for the church picnic.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.413
<i>I'd heard of chitlins, of course. </i>

19:16.488 --> 19:18.479
<i>I thought they were one of those</i>
<i>rare Southern delicacies... </i>

19:18.557 --> 19:20.548
<i>that taste as good as they sound. </i>

19:20.626 --> 19:24.426
<i>I never realized</i>
<i>they were pig intestines. </i>

19:24.496 --> 19:26.623
<i>The smell was like something</i>
<i>that had been kept around... </i>

19:26.698 --> 19:28.689
<i>too long in autopsy class. </i>

19:31.003 --> 19:34.530
I don't care how many times
you two clean them.

19:34.606 --> 19:38.337
You'd have to certify me crazy
before I'd eat anybody's chitlins.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.743
No offense, Papa Jesse.
Oh, no offense taken.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.241
I may have
lost my taste for 'em myself.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.313
You okay, Papa Jesse?
You're lookin' a little pale.

19:50.789 --> 19:54.816
I'm just a little tired. That's all.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.761
Chitlins... and collard greens.
Oh, my God!

19:58.830 --> 20:02.596
And fresh-baked corn bread.
"Yumola!"

20:02.668 --> 20:06.764
Okay. You're all chopped
and ready, Papa Jesse.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.568
You're on your own.
Come on, Mama.

20:13.178 --> 20:16.045
Y- You're not gonna help?

20:16.114 --> 20:18.912
I promised Nell
I'd help her finish her dress.

20:19.952 --> 20:23.115
And I have to work on my Sunday sermon. But I...

20:23.188 --> 20:26.282
You shouldn't have volunteered
if you didn't wanna do it, Papa Jesse.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.120
Hey, don't worry about it, pal.

20:31.196 --> 20:35.030
I got a killer recipe
for chitlins.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.906
You know, this is when
I hate being a hologram.

20:43.976 --> 20:47.935
The smell of chitlins and greens cooking
is a religious experience.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.140
I feel like
the Wicked Witch of the West.

20:50.215 --> 20:53.742
Let's see. Garlic, onions,
green peppers, celery,

20:53.819 --> 20:55.912
hog maw...
Animal stomach?

20:55.988 --> 20:58.320
Uh- Yeah, chopped finely.

20:58.390 --> 21:02.156
Now, uh, what am I forgetting?
How sick this is making me.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.218
Hey, give me
a little gratitude, will you?

21:04.296 --> 21:08.790
Here I am busting my brains off trying to
remember a recipe, and I can't even taste it.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.201
Oh, trust me. You'll be
able to taste all you want.

21:11.202 --> 21:12.098
That's it! Trust you.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.230
You taste the stock.
Tell me what's missing.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.639
- Are you crazy?
- Not as crazy as you are.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.872
Or at least that's what people are gonna say
they see you in here talkin' to yourself.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.245
It just kinda helps me think
while I'm cooking.

21:24.316 --> 21:28.082
Maybe your being crazy is what happened
to you today at Miz Patty's.

21:28.153 --> 21:31.145
What happened? Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.851
Nothin'? Nell said you walked
right in to Miz Patty's,

21:33.925 --> 21:37.520
sat down at her lily-white counter
just as bold as you please.

21:37.596 --> 21:39.587
Sam, you didn't?

21:40.632 --> 21:43.567
Well, I guess I did.
Papa Jesse,

21:43.635 --> 21:45.626
I don't want this family harmed...
Sam, we gotta have a serious talk.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.865
just 'cause you feel it's time
for a bunch of rednecks...

21:47.939 --> 21:51.067
to change somethin' they've been
taught since the day they was born.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.235
Please.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.476
No more sittin'
at lunch counters.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.188
Needs a little more salt.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.993
Night, Daddy.
Good night.

22:23.208 --> 22:26.575
Sam. It, uh, needs a little more salt.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.636
Sam, you promised me
you would lay low,

22:28.714 --> 22:31.342
save Miz Melny and then
leap out of here.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.214
I didn't know I was black!

22:34.286 --> 22:37.255
And even if I did, I got a right
to sit at that lunch counter.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.950
No, no. In 1955, you didn't.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.959
Well, maybe I should have.
No, Sam.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.587
And maybe that's why I'm here.
No. No, no, no.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.632
Ziggy has this "Miz Melny
train wreck" business...

22:47.699 --> 22:50.224
computed to a 96.2% certainty.

22:50.302 --> 22:54.363
You're here to save her tomorrow, not to
initiate civil rights activity in the South.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.430
Well, maybe I can do both.

22:56.508 --> 22:59.341
You're out of your league, Sam.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.980
I sat at that counter
because I was hungry.

23:04.049 --> 23:08.383
And everybody went nuts because they saw me
as a black man instead of as a hungry man.

23:08.453 --> 23:11.320
Now, that's wrong. If...
- No!

23:12.958 --> 23:15.722
Nell! Nell!
What is it?

23:22.033 --> 23:25.434
You've got no right!
No right at all!

23:25.504 --> 23:28.337
No right at all.

23:35.947 --> 23:37.938
What do you mean
there's no need to do anything?

23:38.016 --> 23:40.109
Well, just that, Jesse.

23:40.185 --> 23:42.949
Why don't you just go on home,
you clean up your yard.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.012
Let's forget about all this.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.751
But I can identify 'em,
Sheriff.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.055
It was the two called Toad
and Billy Joe.

23:49.127 --> 23:52.358
Well, them boys...
You know how boys are, Jesse.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.422
They're just being mischievous.

23:54.499 --> 23:58.959
I don't think burnin' a cross on somebody's
front lawn is "mischievous," Sheriff.

23:59.037 --> 24:00.971
Is that right?
That's right.

24:01.039 --> 24:03.906
Well, you know, maybe you should
have thought about that, Jesse,

24:03.975 --> 24:08.036
before you plopped your colored butt
down on a stool over there at Miz Patty's.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.377
What about Billy Joe and Toad?

24:11.483 --> 24:13.644
You leave my son to me.

24:13.718 --> 24:17.415
Now, I plan to have me a talk
with him and that Toad boy.

24:26.598 --> 24:31.763
It doesn't end with this, Sheriff. Well,
that's entirely up to you, Jesse, isn't it?

24:31.837 --> 24:33.828
Entirely.

24:50.455 --> 24:53.015
Oh, that's it.
He's gone too far.

24:54.593 --> 24:56.527
Not here.

25:07.539 --> 25:10.167
I don't have a drop of
water in my kitchen.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.233
I can't cook.
I can't wash.

25:16.147 --> 25:18.138
Okay.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.153
Yeah.
Ah!

25:23.221 --> 25:25.553
Oh!

25:28.660 --> 25:31.060
Oh! The pipe is broken.

25:31.129 --> 25:33.927
I know the pipe is broken.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.495
I'll have to get a new one.

25:38.570 --> 25:42.597
Oh, well, I suppose it can wait
till after tea.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.699
Come along, Jesse.

26:01.459 --> 26:04.121
Jesse Tyler, what in heaven's name are you doin'?

26:04.195 --> 26:07.221
You made tea for us,
so I thought I'd join you.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.324
Jesse,

26:09.401 --> 26:12.302
somebody has lowered the wick
in your brain.

26:12.370 --> 26:15.066
I make tea for you
every afternoon,

26:15.140 --> 26:17.574
and you have it there
in the kitchen.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.801
Miz Melny, you were kind enough
to make this for me.

26:20.879 --> 26:24.007
It just seemed like good manners
to sit with you and share your company.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.609
But... I can't have tea
with you, Jesse.

26:27.686 --> 26:28.250
Why not?

26:28.251 --> 26:31.918
Coloreds and whites
don't eat at the same table.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.151
If you wanna eat with me,
who says you can't?

26:34.225 --> 26:36.159
- I say I can't.
- Why?

26:36.227 --> 26:39.993
Well, because
it's the way things are,

26:40.065 --> 26:42.863
the way things
have always been.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.801
Maybe it's time they changed.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.532
Answer the door, Jesse.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.767
Yes, ma'am.

27:00.418 --> 27:02.352
Hi, Nell. Oh.

27:02.420 --> 27:06.356
I forgot to tell you. I'm gonna
drive Miz Melny's car home tonight.

27:06.424 --> 27:09.154
She's gonna let you drive
that old Buick to our place?

27:10.462 --> 27:13.022
Well, I-I gotta work
on the engine.

27:13.098 --> 27:15.157
Papa Jesse, what are you up to?

27:15.233 --> 27:18.725
Nothin'. Nothin'. You just go
on, and I'll meet you at supper.

27:18.803 --> 27:22.796
Okay. Just as well.
I'm late for choir practice as it is.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.865
Bye.
Bye-bye.

27:29.981 --> 27:33.144
Hogwash.

27:33.218 --> 27:36.051
Beg pardon?

27:36.121 --> 27:39.613
What you were talkin'
is hogwash.

27:39.691 --> 27:42.182
Nobody's gonna change
the way things are.

27:42.260 --> 27:45.661
- But they will. Blacks are gonna unite...
- "Blacks"?

27:45.730 --> 27:48.392
Blacks. That's what they'll-

27:48.466 --> 27:50.934
That's what we'll be called
instead of "Negroes "

27:51.002 --> 27:53.994
What's in God's name's wrong
with being called a niggra?

27:54.072 --> 27:56.597
Maybe it's just a little too close
to "nigger. "

27:57.976 --> 28:02.675
I've never used that word, Jesse,
not to your face or behind your back.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.944
When you sat at Miz Patty's counter,
I figured you were...

28:06.017 --> 28:09.953
just gettin' old or...
somehow it slipped your mind.

28:10.021 --> 28:14.890
But now I think you've gone
just plumb crazy.

28:14.959 --> 28:16.950
I've gone crazy?

28:17.962 --> 28:21.591
Miz Melny, I'm not the one burning crosses
in the front of people's homes.

28:26.171 --> 28:29.971
<i>No, no, no
You just got to wait</i>

28:30.041 --> 28:33.238
<i>You've gotta trust God
and give him time</i>

28:33.311 --> 28:36.906
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

28:39.951 --> 28:42.511
I ain't killin' him.

28:42.587 --> 28:46.580
Nevil Pressy had to move to Georgia 'cause of
trying to teach that Blouchette boy a lesson.

28:46.658 --> 28:48.649
Toad, we ain't gonna kill him.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.821
We're just gonna whack him
back into place a little bit.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.955
<i>Yeah</i>

28:54.032 --> 28:57.991
<i>You can't hurry my God
No, no, no</i>

28:58.069 --> 29:00.128
<i>You just got to wait</i>

29:00.205 --> 29:03.402
<i>You've gotta trust God
and give him time</i>

29:03.475 --> 29:06.603
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

29:06.678 --> 29:09.579
<i>But he'll be there
Don't you... </i>

29:17.822 --> 29:19.813
Damn niggers! They can't drive
no better than a mule!

29:19.891 --> 29:23.418
We better see how bad they're hurt. Now get
in here, man! We gotta get the hell outta here!

29:32.504 --> 29:34.938
The change can be
bloody or peaceful.

29:35.006 --> 29:37.702
And you can make the difference
around here. People respect you.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.006
If you change,
so might some of them.

29:43.047 --> 29:45.242
The tea's cold.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.477
Gonna fix that leak or not?

29:54.459 --> 29:56.450
I'll have to go to town
and get a new pipe.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.860
I'll get my pocketbook.

30:00.398 --> 30:03.060
No, no. You can't.
It's too hot today.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.125
I'm not gonna melt.

30:05.203 --> 30:08.604
Besides, I need to stop at Pratt's
Pharmacy and get some things.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.642
I'll get 'em.
They're personal.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.643
Well...
Look, Miz Melny,

30:13.711 --> 30:17.875
I- I think that I can fix that leak, you know,
without getting a new pipe.

30:17.949 --> 30:20.110
All right. I'll drive myself. No.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.981
If you're that set on going,
I'll drive you.

30:28.059 --> 30:30.892
Just let me get my... coat.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.899
<i>I had a knot in my stomach
the size of Ziggy's control mouse. </i>

30:36.968 --> 30:39.402
<i>Even though we were driving</i>
<i>away from the tracks,</i>

30:39.470 --> 30:42.064
<i>away from the train</i>
<i>and away from Miz Melny's fate,</i>

30:42.140 --> 30:44.074
<i>it wouldn't go away. </i>

30:48.112 --> 30:51.013
Oh, my Lord!
Isn't that your Willis's car?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.892
Nell!

31:12.203 --> 31:17.072
- Is she all right?
- She has a severe laceration.

31:17.141 --> 31:20.770
- I've gotta stop the hemorrhaging.
- Oh, Jesse!

31:34.459 --> 31:36.450
Miz Melny, get back in the car.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.828
Oh, Jesse, there's so much blood.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.896
We gotta get her to a hospital.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.469
- Hurry, Jesse!
- Keep pressure on it, Miz Melny.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.522
You'll be fine, child, just fine.

32:15.867 --> 32:16.707
Where you goin', Jesse?

32:16.708 --> 32:18.768
To the hospital on the
other side of the cemetery.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.464
Legada?
That's a white hospital.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.973
- Colored hospital is in Vida.
- Which is closest?

32:24.042 --> 32:27.500
- Legada, but they won't take her, Jesse.
- The hell they won't.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.031
Get me a doctor and a gurney!
Quick!

32:58.209 --> 33:01.042
Oh, she's cold.
We're gonna fix that.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.684
She's in shock, lost a lot of blood.
I think she severed a temporal artery.

33:08.753 --> 33:13.156
She'll need a transfusion and a...
What are you waiting for?

33:13.224 --> 33:15.784
We don't accept colored here.
I'm sorry.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.693
You're gonna be a hell of a lot sorrier if
you don't help me. And I mean right now!

33:18.763 --> 33:21.254
I'll call the sheriff. I can't
help her. It's against the law.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.766
To hell with the law.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.269
Aren't you Delia Parker's son?

33:28.272 --> 33:30.968
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, you know who I am.

33:31.042 --> 33:32.976
Yes, Miz Trafford.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.103
I want you to help that child.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.312
Let's get her inside.

33:48.459 --> 33:50.450
Get an I.V.
and a cross match.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.687
Jesse.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.368
I think you best
stay out here.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.665
I'll see she's taken care of.

34:17.855 --> 34:21.222
- I don't know how you pulled it off.
- It was Miz Melny.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.283
She got that bigoted idiot
to do something.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.159
Now, Sam, uh, why don't you
get Miz Melny right now,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.425
put her in the car
and drive away from here?

34:28.498 --> 34:30.489
Why?
"Why"?

34:30.568 --> 34:32.661
You got 23 minutes,
or that train is gonna hit her.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.728
So I should get in the car
and start driving? Yeah.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.739
Crossing's that way.
You go that way.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.174
Al, you're getting
a little paranoid.

34:39.243 --> 34:41.473
Sam, how do you think
I lived this long?

34:41.545 --> 34:43.536
Sam, I'm not kidding you.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.639
I've got a bad feeling
about this one.

34:45.716 --> 34:47.946
You always have a bad feel...

34:49.786 --> 34:52.187
I knew it, Sam.
Damn it. I knew it.

34:58.162 --> 35:00.153
He's the one, Sheriff.

35:00.231 --> 35:02.222
Jesse.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.998
I thought I warned you
about causing any more trouble.

35:06.070 --> 35:10.564
All I did was bring a girl here
who needed medical assistance.

35:10.641 --> 35:12.632
A niggra girl.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.142
That's breakin'
the segregation law, Jesse.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.682
What was I supposed to do, Sheriff,
just let her bleed to death?

35:18.749 --> 35:20.944
No, I-I reckon not.

35:21.018 --> 35:24.146
"No, I reckon not" is right.

35:24.222 --> 35:26.850
- What are you doing, Sheriff?
- Sam, you gotta get out of this.

35:26.924 --> 35:27.832
Look, I'm trying.

35:27.833 --> 35:30.223
He's crazy as a loon,
Sheriff. Talks to himself.

35:30.294 --> 35:33.229
Look, Sheriff...
You just ease up here, Jesse,

35:33.297 --> 35:35.288
or I might have
to get rough with you.

35:35.366 --> 35:37.857
Okay, okay. Okay.

35:37.935 --> 35:42.065
- Just on-nn one condition.
- What's that?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.768
Don't let Miz Melny leave here,
even if she wants to,

35:44.842 --> 35:47.504
- for, uh...
- Twenty minutes.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.172
Uh, half hour.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.409
- Why?
- Does it matter?

35:55.887 --> 35:58.879
- You got that, Ethel?
- Yes, sir.

35:58.956 --> 36:01.254
Okay?

36:01.325 --> 36:03.816
Okay.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.496
Jesse?
Nell's gonna be just fine.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.270
Oh, thank God.

36:19.343 --> 36:22.278
- Where's Jesse?
- The sheriff arrested him.

36:22.346 --> 36:24.610
Yeah. Pig butt here
turned him in.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.843
Arrested? For what?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.146
Bringin' that niggra here.

36:30.221 --> 36:32.212
Well, he's just gonna
have to arrest me.

36:32.290 --> 36:36.021
- Oh, they wouldn't do that.
- Miz Trafford!

36:36.093 --> 36:38.425
Sheriff Blount said
you was to wait here.

36:38.496 --> 36:42.933
Did he?
Well, he's in for a surprise.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.163
Attagirl. Oh, no, no, no!
No. I take that back.

36:46.237 --> 36:49.263
Uh, no, no, no, no. No, you
can't do that, Miz Melny.

36:49.340 --> 36:52.309
Miz Melny, uh- Uh-
Oh, God, Sam!

36:52.376 --> 36:54.970
Please have the car keys
in your pocket.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.809
Uh- Uh, Miz Melny, uh,
we got a real...

37:00.885 --> 37:03.649
We got a problem...
Oh, she can't hear me.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.690
Uh, no, no. Don't back up.
Uh- Uh, Miz Melny?

37:06.757 --> 37:08.748
Uh- Oh, what am I gonna do?

37:08.826 --> 37:11.226
No. Uh- Uh, Miz Melny.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.286
Now, uh, you should
wait for Jesse.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.389
The sheriff said
to wait 30 minutes.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.400
Damn!

37:17.468 --> 37:19.766
Miz Melny, stop.
Stop, stop, stop!

37:19.837 --> 37:22.772
Stop! Stop!
Never mind.

37:30.181 --> 37:33.810
Gooshie. Tell Ziggy
to center me in on Miz Melny.

37:34.852 --> 37:39.016
Do it, Gooshie, damn it!
Or I'll smash your brains off!.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.328
Arrestin' Jesse
for carin' for his own!

37:46.397 --> 37:48.558
Oh, I wish you were here, Charles.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.295
- You always did know what to do.
- So do I.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.617
And what you have to do,
Miz Melny, is stop the car.

37:54.618 --> 37:55.965
Am I in the right gear?

38:01.946 --> 38:03.937
Charles, it's been so long.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.006
Uh, reverse. You'd be better off
in reverse, Miz Melny.

38:06.083 --> 38:09.018
Well, what difference does it make?
As long as we get there.

38:09.086 --> 38:11.953
But-But you're not going
to get there, Miz Melny.

38:18.429 --> 38:20.420
Better late than never.
Than never.

38:20.498 --> 38:23.524
And it's going to be never, Miz Melny,
unless you stop the car!

38:27.271 --> 38:29.239
That awful ringin' again.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.403
It's not ringing, Miz Melny. It's
a train whistle. A train whistle!

38:35.713 --> 38:38.238
I suppose I should
visit Dr. Clifford,

38:38.316 --> 38:40.716
but I never did care
for his bedside manner.

38:43.788 --> 38:48.521
Miz Melny, I am ordering you to
stop this car! Peace and quiet.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.488
You have to hear that whistle!

38:57.401 --> 38:59.699
The cemetery.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.829
- Pull off into the cemetery!
- The wrong gear.

39:04.275 --> 39:07.108
Pull off into the cemetery,
damn it!

39:19.724 --> 39:21.715
Thank you, Charles.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.884
You didn't have to swear.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.896
It was incredible.
Real twilight zone stuff.

39:36.974 --> 39:39.670
Sam, she had
to have heard me.

39:39.744 --> 39:42.144
That's great, Al.
Just think of the possibilities.

39:42.213 --> 39:46.650
I mean, if I reached Miz Melny,
then maybe-just maybe...

39:47.651 --> 39:49.642
I can reach other women.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.688
Younger women.

39:53.758 --> 39:58.695
What?

39:58.763 --> 40:01.459
Is sex all you ever think about?

40:01.532 --> 40:06.060
Well, except when I'm pulling you
out of the fire, yes.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.628
Yeah.

40:08.706 --> 40:11.641
Well, you got me there, Al.

40:11.709 --> 40:16.078
Oh, I forgot to tell you. Ziggy
finally came up with some data on Jesse.

40:16.147 --> 40:18.775
What happened to him?
Nothing happened to him.

40:18.849 --> 40:22.285
He's still alive in our time. The guy
must be, I don't know, 105 years old.

40:22.353 --> 40:25.322
Isn't that a kick in the butt? That's great.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.049
Well, then, why am I here?

40:29.126 --> 40:33.028
I mean, Miz Melny's alive.
I'm alive.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.565
Why haven't I leaped?
Oh, I...

40:36.767 --> 40:39.133
Well, maybe we're gonna find out. Jesse.

40:41.572 --> 40:45.975
Miz Melny persuaded me to
drop the charges against you.

40:46.043 --> 40:48.443
- I talked to the hospital this mornin...
- How's Nell?

40:48.512 --> 40:51.948
She's fine. They say she’s gonna
be just fine. Don't you worry none.

40:52.016 --> 40:55.918
She, uh-he told them
how this, uh,

40:55.986 --> 40:57.977
accident happened.

40:58.055 --> 41:00.046
Well, seems like
a couple of the boys,

41:00.124 --> 41:03.116
they sort of...
run her off the road.

41:03.194 --> 41:06.891
- They didn't mean to hurt her none.
- Well, what did they mean to do, Sheriff?

41:06.964 --> 41:09.558
Well, I suppose maybe they thought
you were in that car, Jesse.

41:09.633 --> 41:13.000
I mean, you have been actin' mighty
strange around here lately.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.732
- Maybe they just wanted to...
- To what, Sheriff?

41:16.807 --> 41:18.741
Maybe teach me a lesson?

41:18.809 --> 41:21.004
Well, there ain't nobody
gonna be, uh,

41:21.078 --> 41:23.740
botherin' you
or any of yours again.

41:24.849 --> 41:26.874
I give you my word on that.

41:26.951 --> 41:29.476
It's not good enough, Sheriff.

41:29.553 --> 41:32.886
Just take it easy, Sam.
It's going to happen.

41:32.957 --> 41:36.552
Damn it, Jesse! Now, I'm telling you
them boys is sorry.

41:36.627 --> 41:39.027
Four months from today,
What boys, Sheriff?

41:39.096 --> 41:41.530
Rosa Parks
and Martin Luther King...

41:41.599 --> 41:44.727
- I've said all I'm sayin...
- Are gonna start the Montgomery boycotts.

41:44.802 --> 41:48.761
Now you better just get on outta here,
Jesse, before I change my mind. Go on.

41:56.046 --> 41:59.038
You're gonna have to change your mind
about a lot of things, Sheriff.

42:08.392 --> 42:10.383
I'll see ya, Al.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.468
<i>Deep in</i>

42:23.541 --> 42:26.806
<i>My heart</i>

42:26.877 --> 42:30.142
<i>I do</i>

42:30.214 --> 42:33.206
<i>Believe</i>

42:33.284 --> 42:36.253
<i>That we shall</i>

42:36.320 --> 42:39.687
<i>Overcome</i>

42:40.691 --> 42:44.388
<i>Someday</i>

42:59.543 --> 43:01.670
I'm glad to see you got home safely,
Miz Melny.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.737
No thanks to you, goin' out
and gettin' yourself arrested.

43:04.815 --> 43:06.806
Well, I-I won't let it
happen again.

43:06.884 --> 43:09.079
If it was up to me,
you'd still be in jail.

43:09.153 --> 43:11.144
It's not up to you.

43:11.221 --> 43:13.416
Mama, Jesse is just usin' you.
If you can't see that...

43:13.490 --> 43:17.984
My relationship with Mr. Tyler
is my business.

43:18.062 --> 43:20.496
Now you go mind yours,
and I'll see you for supper.

43:21.932 --> 43:23.923
Yes, ma'am.

43:25.836 --> 43:29.465
- Thank you.
- Sometimes I think they switched babies on me.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.770
No. No, I mean...
Not about Clayton.

43:31.842 --> 43:33.901
I mean, thank you...

43:33.978 --> 43:35.969
for doing what you did for Nell
at the hospital.

43:36.046 --> 43:39.777
Why, I was glad to do it, Jesse,
and she's doin' fine.

43:39.850 --> 43:42.910
They moved her to Vida this mornin'. Moved her?

43:42.987 --> 43:45.353
She was in critical condition.
A move could've killed her.

43:45.422 --> 43:48.289
Well, it didn't, and she's fine...

43:48.359 --> 43:50.350
and she's with her own people.

43:50.427 --> 43:52.622
And that is the way
it's supposed to be.

43:52.696 --> 43:58.464
Now, let's both of us try to forget
all about this horrible business...

43:58.535 --> 44:00.526
and let things
get back to normal.

44:00.604 --> 44:03.573
How can your life go back to normal
after yesterday?

44:03.641 --> 44:07.133
Miz Melny, you can't have done what
you did without it opening your eyes.

44:07.211 --> 44:10.908
To what? To the fact
that the world isn't just?

44:10.981 --> 44:13.973
I knew that, Jesse.

44:14.051 --> 44:16.042
But my knowin' it
doesn't change it.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.588
You changed it yesterday,
and you can change it today.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.817
If you want to go off
and change the world,

44:20.891 --> 44:23.121
you're welcome to it.

44:23.193 --> 44:26.253
But if you want to work for me,

44:26.330 --> 44:29.663
we will close this conversation
forever.

44:31.969 --> 44:35.996
Now, please go over
to Miz Patty's...

44:36.073 --> 44:38.064
and pick up my lunch.

44:39.143 --> 44:41.873
Miz Melny,
once you've seen the light,

44:41.945 --> 44:44.106
you cannot go back
into the darkness.

44:44.181 --> 44:48.117
Get my egg salad.
Jesse.

44:50.421 --> 44:52.582
Yes, ma'am.

45:06.303 --> 45:08.294
There's the jailbird.

45:15.279 --> 45:17.645
You here to pick up
Miz Melny's lunch, Jesse?

45:19.316 --> 45:21.910
I guess I am.

45:29.526 --> 45:31.824
Thank you, Miz Patty.
Never mind, Jesse.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.886
I've decided to eat it here.

45:35.065 --> 45:38.557
Good afternoon, Miz Trafford. Nice to
see you, ma'am. Nice to see you today.

45:38.635 --> 45:41.627
- How are you, Miz Patty?
- Just fine, ma'am.

45:41.705 --> 45:44.105
Would you like something
to drink with the egg salad?

45:44.174 --> 45:46.199
Some of your lemonade
would be just fine.

45:46.276 --> 45:47.937
All right.

45:49.313 --> 45:51.975
Oh, Jesse.

45:52.049 --> 45:55.246
Will you join me for lunch?

46:05.229 --> 46:07.220
Sit down.
Just sit down.

46:11.969 --> 46:13.960
Yes, ma'am, I guess I will.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.476
Oh, boy.
