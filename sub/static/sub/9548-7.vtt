00:08.100 --> 00:09.680
In focus, an unfiltered look

00:09.690 --> 00:12.450
At the news, the people behind the news,

00:12.560 --> 00:14.750
And the stories behind the headlines.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.620
Reporting from san francisco, James Novak.

00:19.180 --> 00:22.770
Good evening, and welcome to In Focus.

00:23.870 --> 00:26.660
He is a mass of contradictions.

00:27.130 --> 00:30.620
A man afflicted with a disorder so paralyzing

00:30.690 --> 00:33.440
That ten years ago he was forced to resign

00:33.450 --> 00:35.500
From the san francisco police department.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.050
Since then, as a private consultant,

00:38.130 --> 00:42.150
He has solved an astonishing 99 cases.

00:42.260 --> 00:45.590
Cases that were considered unsolvable.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.130
Tonight on In Focus, we follow Adrian Monk,

00:50.140 --> 00:52.610
This modern-day sherlock holmes,

00:52.620 --> 00:55.200
As he attempts a career milestone--

00:55.230 --> 00:59.090
Solving his 100th case for the san francisco p.d.

00:59.470 --> 01:00.900
And what a case it is.

01:00.910 --> 01:02.990
Perhaps the most challenging of his career.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.240
A vicious serial killer is on the loose.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.540
Young women are being slaughtered.

01:08.550 --> 01:10.090
The town is terrorized.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.920
Can Adrian Monk find him and stop him

01:13.230 --> 01:14.950
Before he kills again?

01:15.890 --> 01:19.250
Find out tonight on In Focus.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.910
It's a jungle out there

01:25.420 --> 01:28.530
Disorder and confusion everywhere

01:29.870 --> 01:32.240
No one seems to care

01:32.320 --> 01:33.170
Well I do

01:33.180 --> 01:36.120
Hey, who's in charge here?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.400
It's a jungle out there

01:39.960 --> 01:43.250
Poison in the very air we breathe

01:43.250 --> 01:45.620
Do you know what's in the water that you drink?

01:45.630 --> 01:49.920
Well I do, and it's amazing

01:50.180 --> 01:53.280
People think I'm crazy, 'cause I worry all the time

01:53.290 --> 01:56.240
If you paid attention, you'd be worried too

01:56.580 --> 01:58.040
You better pay attention

01:58.050 --> 02:04.690
Or this world we love so much might just kill you

02:04.740 --> 02:08.830
I could be wrong now, but I don't think so

02:08.840 --> 02:11.360
It's a jungle out there

02:11.620 --> 02:13.740
It's a jungle out there

02:27.210 --> 02:29.810
Okay, take the shot.

02:29.990 --> 02:31.830
Take the shot. Take the shot!

02:31.840 --> 02:33.050
Take the--

02:33.540 --> 02:35.070
Foul! Foul! Did you see that?

02:35.080 --> 02:36.230
He fouled him.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.450
Hey, captain, have you seen mr. Monk?

02:39.940 --> 02:42.050
I figured he was with you. He usually is.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.410
Did you change the channel?

02:44.420 --> 02:46.390
It's a commercial break. I'll change it right back.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.410
No, no.

02:48.420 --> 02:50.700
No, no, it's a playoff game.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.260
It's a five-point game.

02:52.860 --> 02:53.550
Where were you?

02:53.560 --> 02:54.930
The natives are getting restless.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.100
Yeah, and they're drinking all the wine.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.340
I thought you were getting the chateau angelus.

02:58.350 --> 03:00.580
Well, we do have prince Charles coming next week.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.820
So I thought I'd save the good stuff for him.

03:02.900 --> 03:04.740
Come on, it's a bunch of cops.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.000
They're not gonna notice the difference,

03:06.010 --> 03:07.250
Believe me.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.690
Oh, Jim.

03:09.910 --> 03:11.830
It's a great party. Thanks again.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.420
The wine's amazing too.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.050
It's the least I could do.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.920
After all, you guys let us tag along

03:16.930 --> 03:17.820
With you all week long.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.990
I hope we didn't cramp your style.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.220
No, not at all.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.690
It was fun.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.000
Jim this is my girlfriend Jillian.

03:25.010 --> 03:27.240
I love your house. Thank you.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.350
You look familiar. Are you an actress?

03:29.360 --> 03:31.460
No, she's in the show, in this episode.

03:31.470 --> 03:32.780
The reenactment scene near the end,

03:32.780 --> 03:33.990
I'm victim number four.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.050
Oh, right, of course.

03:36.270 --> 03:37.650
What else have you done?

03:37.970 --> 03:40.100
Mostly crime shows. Junk like this.

03:40.810 --> 03:42.960
Oh, no, I don't-- not junk, I mean--

03:42.970 --> 03:45.140
Jillian's the queen of reenactments.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.540
She's always getting killed or taken hostage.

03:47.570 --> 03:50.360
She was bludgeoned to death on dateline two weeks ago.

03:50.370 --> 03:52.390
Really? I'm sorry I missed that.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.870
She can do anything, yeah.

03:54.050 --> 03:57.510
She can be stabbed, or shot, or strangled.

03:57.520 --> 03:58.840
Oh, baby, do a stab.

03:58.850 --> 04:00.180
Do a stab. You gotta see this.

04:00.190 --> 04:01.790
No, mr. Novak doesn't want to see--

04:01.800 --> 04:03.340
Well, I've got to see it now.

04:03.350 --> 04:04.730
I'm curious.

04:12.860 --> 04:13.910
What are you doing?

04:14.200 --> 04:15.740
How did you get in here?!

04:22.620 --> 04:23.350
Hmm?

04:23.360 --> 04:24.630
Very nice.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.320
Very convincing.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.710
Good luck to you.

04:30.120 --> 04:31.310
Here you are.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.380
What are you doing back here?

04:32.390 --> 04:33.940
You can't even see the tv.

04:33.950 --> 04:35.440
Which makes it the best seat in the house.

04:35.450 --> 04:36.810
Mr. Monk, you can't sit back here.

04:36.820 --> 04:37.630
You're the guest of honor.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.680
Come on, at least move up a little.

04:42.130 --> 04:42.960
You said "a little."

04:42.970 --> 04:45.300
A little more. Come on.

04:47.950 --> 04:49.480
In focus returns.

04:49.650 --> 04:50.590
James Novak reporting.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.020
Oh, hey, hey, hey, everybody, it's on.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.750
July 18th.

04:59.890 --> 05:02.790
For Adrian Monk, the day began like any other.

05:03.090 --> 05:05.270
He would vacuum his entire apartment.

05:05.280 --> 05:06.890
Then clean the vacuum.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.640
Then vacuum again.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.930
He had no way of knowing that just four blocks away

05:10.940 --> 05:13.700
The body of a young girl was being discovered

05:13.710 --> 05:15.540
And that the san francisco police

05:15.740 --> 05:17.700
Would soon be requesting his services

05:17.930 --> 05:19.630
For the 100th time.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.910
100 cases.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.770
Well, that's a real milestone.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.600
The fact is he almost didn't make it.

05:25.610 --> 05:29.330
Two years ago, they tried to cut Monk from the budget

05:29.340 --> 05:30.740
To save a few bucks.

05:31.820 --> 05:33.390
I went ballistic.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.070
If you go in the commissioner's office,

05:35.080 --> 05:36.570
You'll see there's a little dent in the wall

05:36.580 --> 05:38.140
About the size of my fist.

05:39.220 --> 05:42.270
I got suspended, and Monk got back on the payroll.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.190
Case number 100 would be the ultimate test

05:45.200 --> 05:47.530
Of Adrian Monk's deductive powers.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.310
It began with a call to 911.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.120
911:San Francisco Poice.

05:51.130 --> 05:52.640
Caller:Yeah- There's a body-

05:52.650 --> 05:54.680
I think she's dead- Oh my God...

05:54.690 --> 05:55.890
911:Sir.Where are you calling from?

05:55.900 --> 05:57.010
Caller:She in the lobby.

05:57.020 --> 05:57.950
There's blood all over.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.930
911:Sir.You have to stay calm.Is she breathing?

05:59.940 --> 06:02.530
Caller:I don't think so. Oh my God.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.550
Her name was Cassandre Rank.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.860
27 years old.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.430
She worked as a waitress and occasionally an actress.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.230
She had been brutally strangled.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.860
Apparently, she comes in,

06:14.870 --> 06:16.160
Checks her mail.

06:17.130 --> 06:18.180
Creep's outside.

06:18.190 --> 06:19.810
He breaks the glass. He opens the door.

06:19.820 --> 06:20.980
He comes in.

06:21.110 --> 06:22.570
Strangles her with this.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.230
When you're done with that, may I see it, please?

06:35.450 --> 06:38.130
How did that start, with your hands?

06:38.410 --> 06:39.570
You mean this?

06:40.100 --> 06:40.850
Uh-huh.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.860
Well, I don't remember.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.290
Most of the time, I don't even know I'm doing it.

06:46.300 --> 06:49.550
It has a zen quality to it.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.680
It seems to help me focus on the problem.

06:54.510 --> 06:57.850
I have to block out the rest of the world.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.120
I have to block out any distractions,

07:01.830 --> 07:04.420
Anything that might upset me.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.980
So you're blocking me out right now?

07:07.990 --> 07:09.220
That's right.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.260
I don't know how he does it.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.310
Sometimes when Monk's not around,

07:13.320 --> 07:15.020
I'll catch the other cops doing it, right,

07:15.030 --> 07:16.180
With the hands.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.240
Then like, oh, touch that.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.730
It doesn't work.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.730
Doesn't work for anybody else but him.

07:24.530 --> 07:26.840
With Adrian Monk on the scene,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.250
The investigation was officially underway.

07:36.780 --> 07:39.100
There's one lightbulb up there that's burnt out.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.820
Mr. Monk, just let it go.

07:40.830 --> 07:42.900
Just focus on something.

07:44.610 --> 07:45.910
Um, excuse me, officer,

07:45.920 --> 07:48.370
Can somebody please fix that lightbulb?

07:51.790 --> 07:53.650
Sometimes he sees too much.

07:53.660 --> 07:55.460
He gets distracted.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.310
And that's where you come in?

07:57.320 --> 07:58.800
Right, keeping him focused.

07:58.810 --> 08:00.260
That's one of my jobs.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.220
What else do you do for him?

08:02.270 --> 08:03.470
What else do I do?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.750
Um, how long is your show?

08:12.420 --> 08:13.830
There you go.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.440
That's a 40 watt. The others are 60.

08:18.370 --> 08:19.570
It's 40.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.890
Okay?

08:25.050 --> 08:26.410
Yeah, whatever.

08:26.420 --> 08:29.120
Oh, he has some idiosyncrasies.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.080
Like what?

08:30.090 --> 08:31.070
Fear of heights.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.710
Fear of germs.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.390
Spiders. Milk.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.039
Crowds, elevators, fire.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.960
Rabbits, tunnels, bridges.

08:38.970 --> 08:40.960
Boats. Decaffeinated coffee.

08:40.970 --> 08:41.750
Lightning.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.299
The wind. He's afraid of the wind.

08:43.309 --> 08:44.450
Egg whites. Bad.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.910
Naked people. That one is way up there.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.930
I think it goes "naked people" and then "death."

08:48.940 --> 08:51.180
Who is detective Adrian Monk?

08:51.270 --> 08:53.470
He was born in this modest bay area home

08:53.480 --> 08:56.250
49 years ago, the younger of two brothers.

08:56.250 --> 08:59.180
By all accounts, he was an exceptional child.

08:59.190 --> 09:02.380
I used to babysit for the boys almost every weekend.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.130
What was he like?

09:04.140 --> 09:05.150
Adrian?

09:05.160 --> 09:07.340
Oh, remarkable child.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.970
I tell people this, but they don't believe me.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.680
He used to change his own diaper.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.580
And then he would crawl across the floor

09:17.590 --> 09:19.150
And throw it out.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.990
Remarkable.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.700
Adrian was in my fourth grade class.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.180
He was a brilliant boy.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.910
At first, he was probably

09:27.920 --> 09:29.890
The most promising student I ever had.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.960
What happened?

09:30.970 --> 09:32.800
Well, his father left.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.660
Just took off.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.330
After that, everything changed.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.900
When Adrian was eight,

09:38.910 --> 09:41.490
His father Jack, a frustrated linen salesman,

09:41.500 --> 09:42.880
Told the boys he was heading out

09:42.890 --> 09:44.850
To pick up some chinese food.

09:44.860 --> 09:47.470
Adrian would not see or speak to him again

09:47.520 --> 09:49.520
For 39 years.

09:53.030 --> 09:56.110
Mom didn't leave her room for two years,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.410
And I didn't leave my room.

09:58.420 --> 10:02.640
So it was all up to Adrian.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.220
He kept it all together--

10:04.230 --> 10:05.540
The house, the family.

10:05.550 --> 10:08.590
I don't know how he did it.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.050
He's my hero.

10:12.110 --> 10:14.490
You know, "fan" can mean one thing to you,

10:14.500 --> 10:17.010
And then, you know, something completely different

10:17.020 --> 10:19.980
To, like, say, judge Harriet Waxman

10:19.990 --> 10:22.840
Of the third district court, you know?

10:22.850 --> 10:24.340
And I'll t tell you something

10:24.350 --> 10:26.150
About judge Waxman.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.260
She's never been in love.

10:29.230 --> 10:31.570
So she's shooting from that perspective,

10:31.580 --> 10:32.880
You know what I mean?

10:33.050 --> 10:34.820
Where did you get all these pictures?

10:34.830 --> 10:36.260
Oh, do you like them?

10:37.370 --> 10:38.540
Yeah, yeah, they're, um--

10:38.550 --> 10:41.660
Well, this one is probably my favorite,

10:41.670 --> 10:43.190
If I had to pick a favorite.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.570
This is actually real.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.830
It's not photoshopped at all.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.410
And it's from a case we worked on together,

10:50.420 --> 10:51.730
A homicide.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.410
It took a lot of clue hugs,

10:54.420 --> 10:55.880
But we cracked it.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.750
How 'bout that one?

10:57.760 --> 10:59.010
This one? Okay.

10:59.520 --> 11:04.920
Um, this one is another case,

11:04.930 --> 11:06.920
But this one wasn't,

11:07.420 --> 11:09.080
Um...

11:10.310 --> 11:12.260
This one wasn't as real.

11:12.270 --> 11:13.690
His brain's different.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.930
I mean, I'm not saying that he's a freak or anything.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.690
But it--

11:19.620 --> 11:22.070
No, I justyou know, his brain's different.

11:22.560 --> 11:23.870
Let's just leave it at that.

11:23.880 --> 11:27.250
He hasn't solved 100 cases yet.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.490
For the record, he's still at 99.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.370
So let's not get ahead of ourselves.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.360
You sound a little competitive.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.810
Sometimes I am a little too competitive.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.480
Yes, I own that.

11:39.660 --> 11:42.600
I was just talking about that with my new therapist.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.300
Monk and I both have new therapists.

11:47.090 --> 11:50.640
Mine's way better.

11:50.650 --> 11:53.050
I had Adrian Monk as a passenger

11:53.150 --> 11:55.550
From san francisco to newark.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.440
He'd never flown before.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.920
I don't think he'd ever been out of his house before.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.340
He asked a million questions.

12:02.350 --> 12:05.180
He cried for 2 1/2 hours.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.040
He gave half the cabin a nervous breakdown,

12:08.050 --> 12:10.150
Including me, the co-pilot,

12:10.160 --> 12:11.860
And about a dozen passengers.

12:11.870 --> 12:13.700
We have a support group now.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.450
We meet every month.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.580
Really?

12:17.810 --> 12:19.940
The last one was in minneapolis.

12:19.950 --> 12:21.350
I couldn't make it.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.100
Why not?

12:22.110 --> 12:23.910
I'm afraid to fly.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.160
Back at the scene,

12:25.170 --> 12:27.780
Detective Monk makes a startling discovery.

12:55.840 --> 12:56.960
Her lipstick.

12:56.970 --> 12:58.240
Yeah, what about it?

12:58.410 --> 12:59.700
It's on the cup.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.650
There's some on her lips.

13:02.560 --> 13:03.870
But it's not here,

13:03.880 --> 13:05.870
And it's not in her purse.

13:06.910 --> 13:08.850
What happened to the lipstick?

13:09.790 --> 13:11.410
He took her lipstick?

13:11.550 --> 13:14.130
I didn't tell the press about the missing lipstick.

13:14.630 --> 13:17.020
I always hold back on a couple of key details

13:17.030 --> 13:19.410
So down the road if we do get a confession,

13:19.420 --> 13:20.820
We know if it's genuine.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.190
He does it a lot.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.170
You do it a lot, but you don't always do it, though.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.000
Yes, I do. I always do it.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.310
I just don't always tell him.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.610
This was no random attack.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.840
He knew her.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.330
She knew him.

13:32.340 --> 13:33.750
Look, she comes home.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.380
She's checking her mail. Right.

13:35.380 --> 13:36.970
She sees him through the door.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.500
She recognizes him.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.370
She's not afraid.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.140
She sets the cup down and lets him in.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.790
He grabs her.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.300
Kills her.

13:47.840 --> 13:50.170
Then he punches through the door

13:50.180 --> 13:52.690
To make it look like he had to break in.

13:52.990 --> 13:55.640
The shards of glass from the door,

13:55.650 --> 13:56.870
They're on top of her body.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.780
They're all around her body.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.000
But...

14:01.780 --> 14:03.380
There's nothing underneath it.

14:05.410 --> 14:06.740
Pretty good, huh?

14:07.940 --> 14:09.980
Adrian Monk had no way of knowing

14:09.990 --> 14:12.690
That Cassandre Rank's murder was just the beginning,

14:12.720 --> 14:13.830
And that before the week was out,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.010
The killer would be striking again.

14:17.340 --> 14:20.500
When In Focus continues.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.070
Missed the first free throw.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.340
Second one on its way.

14:32.350 --> 14:33.680
Rebound! Rebound!

14:33.690 --> 14:34.960
Get the damn ball!

14:34.970 --> 14:36.490
And here comes Bozeman with the outlet

14:36.500 --> 14:38.310
Up the center of the floor.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.890
What?

14:39.900 --> 14:42.070
Just for a second. Just to check the score.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.460
We'll turn it back.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.610
What are you, my mother?

14:47.050 --> 14:48.420
What did you say?

14:49.630 --> 14:50.940
Nothing.

14:50.950 --> 14:52.390
Oh, hey, excuse me, Jim.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.520
Uh, sorry to bother you.

14:54.530 --> 14:55.730
It's no big deal.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.210
But when they showed my name on the screen earlier on,

14:58.220 --> 14:59.370
It said "sergeant."

14:59.380 --> 15:02.260
Actually, I'm a full lieutenant.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.520
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.740
Well, these things happen.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.850
Yeah, it's no big deal.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.210
Do you think we could correct it for the dvd?

15:11.220 --> 15:12.660
The dvd?

15:13.340 --> 15:14.490
Absolutely.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.700
I'll take care of that.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.080
That's great. I appreciate that.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.720
Enjoy the party, sergeant.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.610
Oh, pretty exciting, huh?

15:23.860 --> 15:25.330
What happened? Did somebody hug you?

15:25.340 --> 15:26.790
No, no.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.410
There's something wrong.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.040
I feel like I missed something.

15:32.050 --> 15:33.650
Something about that case.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.980
What case?

15:36.190 --> 15:37.210
What, the tv show?

15:37.220 --> 15:38.570
Mr. Monk, you already solved that case.

15:38.580 --> 15:39.590
It's all over.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.220
There's something wrong.

15:44.940 --> 15:45.890
It's starting again, everybody!

15:45.900 --> 15:47.600
In focus returns.

15:47.620 --> 15:49.350
Here we go. James Novak reporting.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.480
Detective Adrian Monk--

15:51.590 --> 15:53.780
Obsessive, peculiar,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.110
Brilliant.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.800
Now in pursuit of his 100th case.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.110
A young woman has been brutally strangled.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.280
The san francisco police had no leads

16:02.290 --> 16:03.980
And no suspects.

16:03.990 --> 16:06.900
Even Adrian Monk, the legendary detective,

16:06.910 --> 16:08.090
Was at a loss.

16:08.210 --> 16:10.380
Then two days later,

16:10.390 --> 16:13.720
The case took a disturbing twist.

16:13.730 --> 16:14.790
Disher.

16:18.070 --> 16:19.640
Captain, we got another girl.

16:20.070 --> 16:21.480
A pattern was emerging.

16:21.490 --> 16:23.430
The second victim, Barbara Mcfarland,

16:23.440 --> 16:25.190
Was also a part-time actress

16:25.200 --> 16:27.490
And had been found brutally strangled.

16:28.550 --> 16:29.700
No, no.

16:31.230 --> 16:32.700
Same m.O.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.380
Strangled from the front.

16:34.390 --> 16:35.240
What about the door?

16:35.250 --> 16:37.360
No forced entry.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.150
He either talked his way in

16:39.900 --> 16:41.390
Or she knew him.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.800
Well, another actress.

16:42.810 --> 16:45.050
Some local theater and some commercials.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.370
What about her lipstick?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.890
Lipstick? Looks like he took it.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.430
Lipstick killer.

16:51.660 --> 16:52.950
Lipstick assassin.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.570
Mr. Lipstick.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.620
I've always wanted to name one of these guys.

16:56.630 --> 16:57.670
Why?

16:58.690 --> 17:00.620
If you can name them, you can catch them.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.410
Why?

17:02.900 --> 17:05.339
Natalie, do you have that picture, photos?

17:05.349 --> 17:06.680
What do you got?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.520
Don't step on the girl.

17:09.510 --> 17:10.970
Water spots.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.210
Monk.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.530
You can't do the victim's dishes.

17:17.540 --> 17:18.480
What, you didn't see it. It was filthy.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.619
Monk, for god's sake. Just one cycle.

17:20.630 --> 17:22.400
No, no. One cycle.

17:22.410 --> 17:23.900
I'll push rinse hold.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.260
You'll push nothing.

17:27.550 --> 17:28.760
There's been a breakthrough in the case.

17:28.770 --> 17:29.680
It's pretty exciting.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.760
Don't look back. Why are you looking back?

17:31.770 --> 17:32.870
So it turns out,

17:32.880 --> 17:33.840
Both victims worked at the same restaurant.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.710
It's one of those theme restaurants.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.260
It's called the morbid cafe.

17:37.270 --> 17:38.670
And the captain wants mr. Monk

17:38.680 --> 17:39.760
To go talk to the manager.

17:39.770 --> 17:41.330
Can you just pull over? Will you, please?

17:41.340 --> 17:42.530
I'm feeling nauseous.

17:42.540 --> 17:43.300
Those bus fumes have made me nauseous.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.780
All right, did I mention he doesn't like driving?

17:47.180 --> 17:48.770
Oh, my god.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.700
People actually eat here?

17:52.710 --> 17:54.240
Yeah, Julie comes here all the time.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.440
She loves it.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.060
See all these props? They're from old horror movies.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.420
We should call the board of health.

17:59.430 --> 18:01.130
Welcome.

18:01.140 --> 18:03.340
I have been expecting you.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.690
You are from the police department,

18:04.700 --> 18:06.570
Is that correct?

18:06.980 --> 18:08.440
That's--that's right.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.860
Okay, I'm Adrian Monk.

18:09.870 --> 18:11.110
And this is Natalie Teeger.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.790
Oh, Natalie, hmm?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.690
What a...

18:14.690 --> 18:16.540
Delicious name.

18:16.980 --> 18:18.440
Why are you talking like that?

18:18.450 --> 18:20.180
I don't know what you mean.

18:20.190 --> 18:22.490
But I see we go to the same tailor.

18:22.500 --> 18:23.030
Ohh.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.420
Mr. Gleckson, we'd like to talk to you

18:24.430 --> 18:26.430
About a woman named Cassandre Rank.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.880
I believe she used to work here.

18:27.890 --> 18:30.370
Yes, Cassandre Rank.

18:30.380 --> 18:32.400
A most delectable young girl.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.840
I remember drinking her blood.

18:34.850 --> 18:37.700
It was a most exquisite aperitif.

18:37.710 --> 18:40.500
She was killed two days ago. Someone strangled her.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.210
What?

18:43.240 --> 18:44.530
Are you serious?

18:44.540 --> 18:46.260
Oh, my god, you must have thought that--

18:46.270 --> 18:48.100
Look, you know that this is just a job, right?

18:48.110 --> 18:49.310
I mean, this is not real blood.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.860
It's all makeup.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.290
Oh, hell, that stuff about drinking her blood.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.270
Oh, crap.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.520
When did she work here?

18:55.530 --> 18:57.120
Uh, about a year ago.

18:57.130 --> 18:58.770
But she was only here for about a month,

18:58.780 --> 19:00.750
And then she got a part in a play or something

19:00.760 --> 19:01.730
And she split.

19:01.740 --> 19:02.850
Nobody stays here that long.

19:02.860 --> 19:05.190
There was another woman named Barbara Mcfarland.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.970
She worked here too, didn't she?

19:08.270 --> 19:09.760
Yes!

19:09.770 --> 19:11.840
Barbara mcfarland.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.000
She had a very delectable neck.

19:14.010 --> 19:14.980
I'm sure of that.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.670
In fact, I am o-positive.

19:16.680 --> 19:17.910
She was killed too.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.400
Oh, come on!

19:19.490 --> 19:20.920
Why didn't you just say that?

19:20.930 --> 19:23.310
Now I look like a monster, like a real monster,

19:23.320 --> 19:24.370
And I'm not.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.380
Oh, hell.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.340
Yeah, no, i, uh--

19:27.350 --> 19:28.390
I knew her a little bit.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.380
She was here for three months.

19:29.390 --> 19:31.520
But did they know each other, Barbara and Cassandre?

19:31.530 --> 19:33.140
I don't think so. I don't think they ever met.

19:33.150 --> 19:36.090
No, Cassandre left, like, a year before Barbara showed up.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.520
Okay, we're gonna need a list of all of your employees,

19:38.530 --> 19:40.100
Everyone who worked here when they did.

19:40.110 --> 19:42.240
Yeah, sure, that's no problem.

19:42.430 --> 19:44.870
And as night falls on san francisco,

19:45.120 --> 19:47.680
Adrian Monk is left alone with the case.

19:47.690 --> 19:51.050
Mr. Monk takes all of his cases very seriously.

19:51.260 --> 19:53.900
But when a woman is killed,

19:54.020 --> 19:55.350
It's different.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.930
It hits him pretty hard.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.480
Because of Trudy?

19:58.500 --> 20:00.570
Yeah, because of Trudy.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.180
Trudy Monk,

20:02.190 --> 20:04.100
The love of Adrian Monk's life

20:04.110 --> 20:07.520
And the only case he hasn't been able to solve.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.450
They met 28 years ago while they were both attending

20:10.460 --> 20:12.190
The university of california.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.230
They were married a short time later.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.340
Trudy's love was so strong

20:16.350 --> 20:18.300
That most of his phobias and personal demons

20:18.310 --> 20:19.640
Were kept at bay.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.420
It would be the happiest time of his life.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.850
Oh, you wouldn't recognize him.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.100
Back in the day, he loved his work.

20:27.110 --> 20:28.690
He loved his life.

20:28.700 --> 20:31.090
He used to walk in here whistling.

20:33.450 --> 20:35.350
He hasn't whistled for a long time.

20:36.340 --> 20:38.480
Then, in a flash,

20:38.990 --> 20:40.620
She was gone.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.950
Two weeks before christmas, 1997,

20:42.960 --> 20:45.360
Trudy Monk was downtown running some errands.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.230
She returned to her car in a parking garage

20:47.240 --> 20:49.540
On summerset avenue.

20:50.090 --> 20:51.550
Our top story tonight,

20:51.560 --> 20:54.550
The wife of a highly decorated san francisco detective

20:54.560 --> 20:56.050
Was killed this morning,

20:56.060 --> 20:58.360
The victim of an apparent car bombing.

20:58.370 --> 21:01.460
Trudy Monk, a 35-year-old freelance journalist

21:01.470 --> 21:04.420
Died a short time later at saint jude's hospital.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.290
Her husband, Adrian Monk,

21:06.300 --> 21:07.670
Was by her side.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.130
The police are pursuing several leads

21:10.140 --> 21:11.830
But have made no arrests.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.280
The case is still open.

21:17.790 --> 21:19.860
It has been Adrian Monk's obsession

21:19.990 --> 21:21.500
For 11 years.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.420
After the hospital,

21:26.450 --> 21:29.080
He came back, back home.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.750
He just sat in that chair all night.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.700
I could see his soul

21:38.330 --> 21:40.210
Leaving his body.

21:43.460 --> 21:45.230
Adrian died too.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.570
The bomb was across town,

21:49.850 --> 21:52.570
But it killed my brother too.

21:52.650 --> 21:54.030
I saw him coming apart

21:54.040 --> 21:56.040
Like those rockets that hit the atmosphere

21:56.050 --> 21:57.890
At the wrong angle.

21:59.550 --> 22:00.960
Nothing I could do.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.040
Can we talk about Trudy?

22:06.080 --> 22:06.860
You didn't leave your house

22:06.870 --> 22:09.000
For, what, three years?

22:09.350 --> 22:11.530
The psychiatrists said you'd never work again.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.660
But here you are 100 cases later.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.630
What keeps you going?

22:21.810 --> 22:24.520
I can't die until I know.

22:30.730 --> 22:33.370
But solving Trudy's murder would have to wait.

22:33.380 --> 22:34.050
Three nights later,

22:34.060 --> 22:36.220
In a parking lot in daly city,

22:36.230 --> 22:38.480
Another girl was strangled.

22:38.650 --> 22:39.790
Bring over that sheet.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.820
Her name was Miranda Terhune.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.160
Like the others, she had worked as an actress

22:44.170 --> 22:46.920
And was strangled with a small piece of cord.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.420
Her lipstick was missing,

22:49.430 --> 22:51.120
So we were pretty sure it was the same guy.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.210
The lipstick assassin.

22:52.220 --> 22:54.120
Nobody's calling him that, Randy.

22:54.950 --> 22:55.610
I am.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.130
No, you're not.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.280
Now, the third girl never worked at the restaurant.

23:00.290 --> 23:03.310
So the three girls had virtually nothing in common.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.700
The case was moving sideways on us.

23:04.710 --> 23:05.780
We didn't have any leads.

23:05.790 --> 23:10.600
I mean, who or where was mr. Lipstick?

23:11.500 --> 23:13.140
Could you turn that off for a minute?

23:13.150 --> 23:14.800
The death toll was rising.

23:14.930 --> 23:17.540
A sense of urgency swept through the department.

23:17.550 --> 23:19.270
Captain Stottlemeyer and his task force

23:19.280 --> 23:21.080
Were working around the clock.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.440
Coffee.

23:25.970 --> 23:27.780
Oh, thank you.

23:47.560 --> 23:48.410
He has an idea. I can tell.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.620
You don't want to miss this. Zoom in.

23:49.830 --> 23:50.720
Go ahead.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.060
I love this part.

23:53.460 --> 23:55.170
I noticed that all three pictures

23:55.180 --> 23:57.880
Were taken by the same photographer.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.730
There were ten other detectives

24:03.740 --> 24:05.130
In that room.

24:05.140 --> 24:07.970
You were the only one who noticed it.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.210
Well, I was Standing closer to the board.

24:10.220 --> 24:11.520
Oh, he's just being modest.

24:11.530 --> 24:13.140
50 cops could have been locked in that room

24:13.150 --> 24:13.650
For a whole year,

24:13.660 --> 24:18.030
And nobody would have noticed it.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.880
Maybe not a year.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.480
Thanks to Adrian Monk,

24:22.490 --> 24:24.490
The police finally had a suspect,

24:24.500 --> 24:27.550
A local photographer named Douglas Thurman.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.290
Was he responsible

24:29.300 --> 24:31.310
For three brutal murders?

24:31.770 --> 24:34.550
And could he be stopped before he killed again?

24:34.790 --> 24:37.650
Find out after these messages.

24:44.770 --> 24:46.980
Down by nine. How did that happen?

24:47.610 --> 24:48.860
Damn.

24:48.870 --> 24:51.230
But who played the girl who died in the car?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.770
Miranda terhune.

24:54.090 --> 24:56.090
I thought she was terrible.

24:56.280 --> 24:57.570
The way she was all sprawled out,

24:57.580 --> 24:59.390
Nobody dies like that.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.900
Actually, she was the real victim.

25:02.670 --> 25:04.190
She was really dead.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.200
Oh, my gosh.

25:06.490 --> 25:08.410
I can't believe I said that.

25:08.690 --> 25:10.530
Everybody makes mistakes.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.670
I even made one myself once.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.950
What was it?

25:13.960 --> 25:15.240
My wife.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.600
What's wrong with him?

25:28.300 --> 25:30.940
He thinks he might have made a mistake.

25:31.400 --> 25:32.540
What, about coming here?

25:32.550 --> 25:33.470
No, about the case.

25:33.480 --> 25:34.760
The one on tv.

25:34.770 --> 25:36.710
He thinks he might have missed something.

25:39.460 --> 25:40.840
Really?

25:41.320 --> 25:43.310
Well, this could get interesting.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.690
Hey, hey, hey, it's on, everybody.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.160
In focus.

25:53.170 --> 25:55.600
Three women have been brutally strangled.

25:55.610 --> 25:56.810
Thanks to Adrian Monk,

25:56.820 --> 25:59.840
San francisco's legendary defective detective,

25:59.850 --> 26:02.010
The police now have a suspect.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.720
His name is Douglas Thurman,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.990
Manager of a local photography studio.

26:06.580 --> 26:09.610
Captain Leland Stottlemeyer and lieutenant Randy Disher

26:09.710 --> 26:10.680
Question their suspect.

26:10.690 --> 26:12.370
I got a lot of clients.

26:12.380 --> 26:14.290
You know models...Actresses...

26:14.300 --> 26:16.640
They like me because I use real film.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.770
None of thie digital crap.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.880
You just take their pictures,huh?

26:20.890 --> 26:22.090
Nothing else?

26:22.090 --> 26:23.450
I'm a profeeional.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.590
I never lay a hand on 'em.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.480
You can ask anybody.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.830
Well,Douglas. We got a problem.

26:29.650 --> 26:32.080
Becaus these girls only had one thing in common,

26:32.090 --> 26:33.710
And that thing is you.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.470
Thurman denied everything.

26:35.570 --> 26:36.740
He wouldn't crack.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.050
With no hard evidence,

26:38.060 --> 26:40.680
The police were forced to release him.

26:46.510 --> 26:48.550
Douglas Thurman was a tough adversary.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.060
But Adrian Monk has faced tough adversaries before.

26:51.070 --> 26:53.670
In fact, he's faced 99 of them.

26:53.680 --> 26:57.390
Almost all of them can be found here

26:57.550 --> 26:59.640
In a california state penitentiary.

27:00.610 --> 27:01.810
Do I remember Adrian Monk?

27:01.820 --> 27:05.030
That's like asking the titanic if it remembers the iceberg.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.330
He joined the siblings of the sun.

27:07.570 --> 27:08.400
Your cult?

27:08.410 --> 27:10.640
It's not a cult. It's an organization.

27:10.940 --> 27:12.850
Like a self-help group.

27:13.760 --> 27:15.810
And two months later, I'm sitting here wearing blues,

27:15.820 --> 27:17.470
Eating off tin plates.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.750
Adrian Monk, if you're watching this,

27:20.760 --> 27:22.230
I want to thank you.

27:22.630 --> 27:23.660
Thank you, brother.

27:23.670 --> 27:25.920
Because behind these gray walls of prison,

27:25.930 --> 27:28.140
I have found complete peace

27:28.180 --> 27:29.910
And total serenity.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.290
Roberts, time's up! Get back to your cell!

27:33.670 --> 27:35.210
Adrian Monk?

27:35.610 --> 27:37.850
I have to admit, I have mixed feelings about him.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.060
I mean, on the one hand, he sent me to prison.

27:40.070 --> 27:41.690
25 years to life.

27:42.130 --> 27:43.840
On the other hand, when they arrested me

27:43.850 --> 27:46.470
He stayed after everybody and cleaned my apartment.

27:46.990 --> 27:49.160
I got my security deposit back,

27:50.020 --> 27:51.510
Which was nice.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.720
Well, killing my girlfriend was the easy part.

27:53.730 --> 27:56.550
The hard part was pretending to be Monk's friend

27:56.560 --> 27:57.510
For a week.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.540
You ever hear the man try and tell a joke?

27:59.550 --> 28:01.430
It's like verbal root canal.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.410
Excruciating.

28:02.420 --> 28:05.240
How did you feel when he arrested you?

28:05.250 --> 28:07.770
I actually--i was feeling sorry for him.

28:07.780 --> 28:10.770
I felt like he was the village idiot or something.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.310
It was humiliating.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.530
Until that there summation thing.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.830
Oh, my god.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.050
Summation.

28:17.060 --> 28:20.130
I love when people tell me what I've already done.

28:20.140 --> 28:22.560
Droned! Just longest four minutes of my life.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.890
I mean, I knew what I did.

28:23.900 --> 28:25.700
I killed her. I didn't need him to tell me.

28:25.710 --> 28:28.000
I worked on my plan for a month.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.940
My plan was perfect.

28:29.950 --> 28:30.870
I had a good plan too.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.740
I was very proud of my plan.

28:32.750 --> 28:33.590
Check this out.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.750
I find a dead daredevil on the side of the road.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.190
I knocked my cousin out,

28:38.200 --> 28:40.100
Put him in the daredevil costume,

28:40.110 --> 28:41.390
And threw him off a roof.

28:41.400 --> 28:42.510
That was you? Yeah.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.460
Oh, that was good.

28:43.470 --> 28:44.410
Well, thank you. Yeah, yeah.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.920
Any other cop never would have figured it out.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.270
That was brilliant, man.

28:48.280 --> 28:49.660
Thanks.

28:49.670 --> 28:52.220
Remind me, didn't you, like, kill a pig

28:52.230 --> 28:55.180
And then prop a jeep up on a salt lick or something?

28:55.190 --> 28:57.180
It wasn't a jeep. It was a pickup truck.

28:57.190 --> 28:58.730
Still, it's pretty fantastic.

28:58.740 --> 29:01.140
You all had fantastic plans.

29:02.290 --> 29:03.900
So what happened?

29:04.390 --> 29:05.180
Adrian Monk.

29:05.190 --> 29:06.650
Yeah, Monk. Monk happened.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.930
The guy is relentless.

29:07.940 --> 29:09.850
Pick, pick, pick, pick, pick.

29:09.860 --> 29:11.530
Meanwhile, the case against Douglas Thurman

29:11.540 --> 29:13.130
Took a surprising twist.

29:13.140 --> 29:16.020
Douglas Thurman disappeared.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.550
He had agreed to take a polygraph test that afternoon,

29:18.560 --> 29:19.990
But never showed up.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.280
The next morning, a judge issued a search warrant

29:22.290 --> 29:24.690
For Thurman's apartment and photo studio.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.990
Do you have the warrant?

29:28.430 --> 29:29.590
What?

29:29.600 --> 29:30.760
You gotta be kidding. You just had it.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.140
You had it in your hand.

29:37.130 --> 29:38.110
Where is it?

29:40.790 --> 29:41.910
Here it is.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.260
It was right behind this cd.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.250
I'm in a band.

29:46.260 --> 29:47.910
It's the Randy Disher project.

29:47.920 --> 29:51.460
Do a sort of jazz fusion, punk, rap, kind of folky--

29:51.470 --> 29:53.940
Randy, just give him the damn cd.

29:54.410 --> 29:55.770
You guys like music?

29:56.560 --> 29:59.100
You are gonna love this.

29:59.110 --> 30:01.600
Oh, was that a--

30:01.800 --> 30:03.310
Is that a scratch?

30:03.550 --> 30:04.820
You know what, I should probably

30:04.830 --> 30:06.750
Put it in to make sure it works.

30:15.390 --> 30:17.920
Doug Thurman, s.F.P.D.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.330
Clear!

30:25.740 --> 30:26.810
Clear!

30:28.750 --> 30:29.790
Clear!

30:34.920 --> 30:36.410
Captain.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.800
Is that lipstick?

30:51.510 --> 30:53.260
Sick enough for you?

30:53.730 --> 30:55.030
I guess that clinches it.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.210
This guy's definitely the cosmetic assassin.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.540
The what?

30:58.550 --> 31:00.810
Cosmetic assassin. That's what we're calling him.

31:00.820 --> 31:03.240
Maybe you'd like to hear what we're calling you.

31:03.890 --> 31:05.470
That was probably the low point.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.580
'cause we had that creep in handcuffs the day before.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.050
We never should have let him go.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.070
But the law is the law.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.440
Insufficient evidence.

31:12.450 --> 31:14.300
We put a statewide apb out on him.

31:14.310 --> 31:15.470
But we were too late.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.020
Douglas Thurman's reign of terror

31:17.030 --> 31:18.590
Was not over yet.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.130
Three hours after the raid,

31:20.140 --> 31:22.650
Kate Kindel, a 24-year-old part-time model,

31:22.660 --> 31:24.620
Was found dead in her apartment.

31:24.630 --> 31:26.560
She had been strangled like the others.

31:26.570 --> 31:29.410
And like the others, she had recently posed

31:29.420 --> 31:31.150
For Douglas Thurman.

31:33.820 --> 31:35.120
Even though he was on the run

31:35.130 --> 31:36.590
And the police were closing in,

31:36.600 --> 31:39.160
Thurman could not control his homicidal instincts.

31:40.940 --> 31:42.300
Behind you!

31:51.380 --> 31:54.510
Early that morning, he broke into Kindel's apartment.

31:55.350 --> 31:57.910
Her landlady found her on the living room floor

31:57.930 --> 31:59.430
Three hours later.

32:00.660 --> 32:02.460
Take a bow, Jillian.

32:02.470 --> 32:03.580
Kate Kindel was a girl--

32:03.590 --> 32:05.280
Well done, Jillian.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.510
Well done.

32:10.420 --> 32:11.450
What?

32:12.220 --> 32:13.790
Look, I just said two words to her.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.320
I just said "well done."

32:15.330 --> 32:18.120
You know, I was just congratulating her.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.250
In 12th grade,

32:19.260 --> 32:20.630
She attended a special school for the performing arts.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.500
Like thousands of other young girls,

32:22.550 --> 32:24.820
She moved to california five years earlier

32:24.830 --> 32:26.020
To follow her dream.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.810
She was 27 years old.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.410
She had worked as a cabaret singer

32:29.420 --> 32:31.710
And had appeared in a number of student films.

32:31.890 --> 32:33.500
She had also been found

32:33.510 --> 32:34.920
Brutally strangled.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.620
Took her lipstick, of course.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.210
It's a little dark.

32:48.220 --> 32:49.800
I could use some light.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.840
Thank you.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.250
This is Stottlemeyer.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.460
It was the news they had all been waiting for.

33:00.470 --> 33:03.050
Douglas Thurman had been spotted in san racine

33:03.060 --> 33:04.800
300 miles away

33:04.880 --> 33:06.650
In a cheap motel.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.700
One hour later, as a s.W.A.T. Team moved in,

33:10.710 --> 33:14.240
Douglas Thurman chose to end the drama himself.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.550
With a single bullet to the head,

33:19.560 --> 33:22.730
Thurman had claimed his final victim.

33:24.440 --> 33:26.920
He has solved his 100th case.

33:26.930 --> 33:28.820
Thanks to him, the people of san francisco

33:28.830 --> 33:31.970
Will wake up tomorrow in a safer, brighter city.

33:32.220 --> 33:35.170
But for Adrian Monk, perhaps the most successful

33:35.180 --> 33:37.870
Homicide detective in the world today,

33:38.150 --> 33:41.100
The night is never-ending.

33:51.790 --> 33:54.490
To mr. Monk, the man of the hour.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.030
Don't be surprised if hollywood producers

33:56.040 --> 33:58.470
Come knocking down your door because you're good, my friend.

33:58.480 --> 33:59.100
You're a star.

33:59.110 --> 34:01.310
Cheers. Hear, hear.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.000
San racine is south.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.130
Excuse me?

34:05.140 --> 34:07.140
Thurman had mexican currency in his wallet

34:07.150 --> 34:08.370
When he killed himself.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.100
He was heading for mexico.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.230
So what?

34:12.239 --> 34:14.340
So Kate Kindel, the fourth victim,

34:14.350 --> 34:16.159
Lived 50 miles north.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.380
Why would he go out of his way like that?

34:19.389 --> 34:21.350
And wasn't she strangled from behind?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.710
All the other victims

34:22.719 --> 34:24.340
Were strangled from the front.

34:24.350 --> 34:26.050
Yeah, you're right, she was strangled from behind.

34:26.060 --> 34:27.110
Right.

34:27.739 --> 34:31.190
Douglas Thurman did kill victims one, two, and three.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.150
We were right about that.

34:33.550 --> 34:37.090
But somebody else killed Kate Kindel.

34:37.100 --> 34:39.780
Well, the case is over, mr. Monk.

34:39.790 --> 34:41.250
I don't think so.

34:41.409 --> 34:43.310
Yes! Swish!

34:44.239 --> 34:45.989
Ha, nothing but net.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.389
What?

34:52.969 --> 34:55.520
Mr. Novak do you have a copy of the episode

34:55.530 --> 34:56.340
We just saw,

34:56.350 --> 34:59.880
Maybe on a vhs tape?

34:59.890 --> 35:01.320
Well, this is dvr.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.210
That's too bad.

35:02.220 --> 35:04.930
If it was on vhs, we could watch it again.

35:05.130 --> 35:08.340
Dvr is digital. It's better than vhs.

35:09.570 --> 35:11.280
Well, then let's do that.

35:11.290 --> 35:14.530
If we could rewind the tape or whatever it is

35:14.540 --> 35:16.230
Back to the photo studio.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.710
Natalie.

35:18.970 --> 35:20.160
Sorry.

35:20.170 --> 35:21.070
It's okay.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.580
It's only triple overtime.

35:22.790 --> 35:25.610
Only the greatest game in the history of basketball.

35:27.820 --> 35:28.970
Okay.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.860
Okay, stop right there.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.370
Now hit the picture play button.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.270
It should say "play" either on the button

35:34.280 --> 35:35.320
Or directly under the--

35:35.330 --> 35:36.690
Yeah, I got that.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.210
Clear!

35:45.560 --> 35:46.690
Clear!

35:48.510 --> 35:49.740
Clear!

35:49.990 --> 35:51.800
Picture freezer! What?

35:51.810 --> 35:53.650
Hit the picture freezer button.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.060
You mean "pause"?

35:55.070 --> 35:56.770
Fine, pause, whatever.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.730
Now go back. Picture go back.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.080
"picture go back."

36:00.090 --> 36:01.260
Picture go back.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.340
Picture freezer!

36:05.830 --> 36:07.940
Okay. Look at the table.

36:08.010 --> 36:11.770
See, all the film canisters are on their side.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.340
Okay, Natalie, picture go fast.

36:15.350 --> 36:17.260
Picture go fast.

36:19.350 --> 36:19.920
Right there,

36:19.930 --> 36:21.400
Picture freezer.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.760
See, there's an additional film cister Standing up.

36:25.340 --> 36:26.880
Well, where the hell did that come from?

36:26.890 --> 36:28.800
That had pictures of Kate Kindel on it, that film.

36:28.810 --> 36:30.040
I bagged that myself.

36:30.050 --> 36:31.870
Are you saying somebody planted the film?

36:31.880 --> 36:33.350
Was it a cop?

36:33.360 --> 36:36.000
No, no, I know every guy on that squad.

36:36.010 --> 36:37.960
And every one of them is a righteous guy.

36:37.970 --> 36:40.030
Well, there were other people in that room.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.430
Okay, Natalie, push picture go fast.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.950
Picture go fast.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.140
Okay.

36:47.290 --> 36:48.790
Okay, this is it.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.540
Picture go regular.

36:59.970 --> 37:02.620
That is so trippy.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.700
Took her lipstick, of course.

37:07.810 --> 37:09.050
It's a little dark.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.990
I could use some light.

37:11.770 --> 37:13.530
Picture freezer!

37:14.710 --> 37:15.710
Mr. Novak,

37:15.720 --> 37:17.990
I asked you to turn on the light.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.260
That's right.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.340
There are five light switches on that panel.

37:21.350 --> 37:23.020
You clicked number four.

37:23.030 --> 37:25.110
It was a lamp right next to me.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.480
How did you know

37:27.800 --> 37:30.070
Which one of those switches to hit?

37:30.390 --> 37:31.780
How did I know what?

37:31.790 --> 37:33.370
You knew that apartment.

37:33.830 --> 37:35.910
You'd been in that room before.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.540
I-i-i'm a little confused.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.170
Are you accusing me of something?

37:40.180 --> 37:41.950
Yes, sir, I am.

37:42.680 --> 37:44.530
It all makes sense.

37:44.820 --> 37:47.100
Kate Kindel was your sex mistress.

37:47.110 --> 37:48.680
I knew it.

37:48.720 --> 37:49.840
Sweetheart, he--

37:49.850 --> 37:50.690
What happened?

37:50.700 --> 37:52.480
Was she threatening to tell your wife?

37:52.490 --> 37:53.760
Did she want money?

37:53.770 --> 37:57.140
All we know for sure is that you wanted her gone.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.680
Working on this show,

37:58.690 --> 38:00.160
On this serial killer story,

38:00.170 --> 38:01.820
Give you the perfect opportunity.

38:01.900 --> 38:02.630
It's true.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.600
You had access to everything,

38:04.610 --> 38:06.550
All the stuff we kept from the public.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.850
The killer's m.O., the lipstick.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.290
Here's what happened.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.160
You knew the police were planning

38:12.170 --> 38:13.920
To raid Thurman's studio in the morning.

38:13.930 --> 38:15.270
That night,

38:15.280 --> 38:17.220
You went to Kate Kindel's apartment.

38:17.230 --> 38:19.670
You told her you wanted to take some pictures.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.300
After the photo session,

38:21.310 --> 38:23.150
You got down to business.

38:29.950 --> 38:31.060
You took her lipstick,

38:31.070 --> 38:32.900
Because that's what Douglas Thurman would have done.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.500
The lipstick assassin.

38:35.690 --> 38:37.180
The next morning during the raid,

38:37.190 --> 38:39.130
You planted the roll of film.

38:41.270 --> 38:43.840
It would look like Kate was just another client.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.850
Just another victim.

38:47.270 --> 38:48.820
It was a perfect plan,

38:48.830 --> 38:50.590
Framing a serial killer.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.830
You should have watched your own show, mr. Novak.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.150
You can't beat the man.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.780
Probably didn't even listen to my cd, did you?

38:56.790 --> 38:58.970
Okay, first of all, you're a terrible singer.

38:58.980 --> 39:01.500
And secondly, you can't go around accusing people.

39:01.510 --> 39:02.830
Where's your proof?

39:06.070 --> 39:07.820
I think I have proof.

39:09.310 --> 39:10.480
What night was it?

39:10.490 --> 39:11.710
July 25th.

39:11.720 --> 39:12.810
I thought so.

39:12.820 --> 39:14.270
It was my brother's birthday.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.500
There was a party that you missed, of course.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.720
He came home at 5:00 a.M. And took a shower.

39:20.730 --> 39:22.390
I was suspicious.

39:22.620 --> 39:24.780
No, I wasn't suspicious.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.300
I knew.

39:26.310 --> 39:28.190
I went through his pockets.

39:28.370 --> 39:29.810
Is this what you need? Yeah.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.910
You can check it for dna, right?

39:31.970 --> 39:33.800
I'll take that, sergeant.

39:43.490 --> 39:44.630
Get down!

39:45.330 --> 39:47.430
Jillian. Somebody call an ambulance.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.430
Jillian?

39:52.940 --> 39:55.630
Oh, sorry. Force of habit.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.200
Force of habit.

39:57.210 --> 39:58.910
I'm sorry.

39:59.690 --> 40:01.080
Oh, you had me.

40:01.090 --> 40:02.480
I did?

40:04.350 --> 40:05.900
That was great.

40:06.140 --> 40:07.750
You totally got me on that.

40:10.100 --> 40:11.640
Is everybody all right?

40:15.220 --> 40:17.930
"the case was broken by former detective Adrian Monk,

40:17.940 --> 40:20.060
"who ironically had recently been featured

40:20.070 --> 40:22.520
"on mr. Novak's newsmagazine program

40:22.530 --> 40:23.670
In focus."

40:23.680 --> 40:25.170
Look, picture.

40:25.180 --> 40:26.340
Very nice.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.710
Nice to go out on a high note.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.520
What do you mean "go out"?

40:30.530 --> 40:33.780
Well, I think it might be time to quit.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.200
100 cases. 100 even.

40:36.310 --> 40:37.900
It's a nice round number.

40:37.910 --> 40:38.990
Wait, wait.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.120
You wanna quit

40:41.130 --> 40:42.460
Because it's an even number?

40:42.470 --> 40:43.690
Makes sense to me.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.020
That is so stupid.

40:45.030 --> 40:45.930
I'm sorry, mr. Monk,

40:45.940 --> 40:47.500
But that is just stupid.

40:47.600 --> 40:48.470
What are you doing?

40:48.480 --> 40:49.660
Rolling up this newspaper.

40:49.670 --> 40:50.410
I wonder why.

40:50.420 --> 40:51.410
To hit you over the head with it

40:51.420 --> 40:52.630
Because you're so stupid!

40:52.790 --> 40:54.870
Come on, come on. Wait.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.000
Wait a minute.

40:56.130 --> 40:57.810
When you caught that serial killer,

40:57.820 --> 41:00.130
That was number 100.

41:00.140 --> 41:01.060
Right. Right, right.

41:01.070 --> 41:04.330
So this case with this tv host,

41:04.600 --> 41:06.750
This was a completely different case.

41:06.750 --> 41:09.040
Different killer, different case.

41:09.810 --> 41:10.990
Oh, my god.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.140
Ha ha! So you're at 101.

41:13.150 --> 41:15.720
Oh, my god. How did this happen?

41:15.730 --> 41:17.520
You wanna stop at a nice round number,

41:17.530 --> 41:19.190
You have to get to 200.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.560
200.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.400
All right, so you better get started.

41:22.410 --> 41:24.630
Let's see if anybody's killed anybody today.

41:24.730 --> 41:26.600
Oh, this looks good, "suspicious drowning."

41:26.610 --> 41:29.110
101, oh, my god.

41:29.180 --> 41:30.460
Why didn't you stop me?

41:30.470 --> 41:32.420
Oh, "runaway truck kills two."

41:32.550 --> 41:34.250
"socialite killed by giant pendulum."

41:34.260 --> 41:35.510
That's juicy.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.750
"billionaire's mistress disappears."

41:37.760 --> 41:39.340
"woman run over by golf cart."

41:39.350 --> 41:40.610
That's weird. Yeah.

41:41.260 --> 41:45.040
"tv writer found dead after contract dispute."

41:45.050 --> 41:47.420
Creepy. That's good.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
