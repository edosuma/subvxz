00:33.820 --> 00:38.074
Only 3 percent of the water
on our planet is fresh.

00:40.618 --> 00:44.664
Yet these precious waters
are rich with surprise.

00:57.884 --> 01:03.390
All life on land is ultimately
dependent upon fresh water.

01:34.668 --> 01:38.797
The mysterious tepuis of Venezuela -

01:39.964 --> 01:44.677
isolated mountain plateaus
rising high above the jungle.

01:54.478 --> 01:59.524
This was the inspiration
for Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lost World,"

01:59.607 --> 02:02.777
an imagined prehistoric land.

02:09.199 --> 02:14.037
Here, strange towers of sandstone
have been sculptured over the millennia

02:14.162 --> 02:17.415
by battering wind and torrential rain.

02:30.762 --> 02:34.890
Moisture rising as water vapor
from the surface of the sea

02:34.973 --> 02:38.018
is blown inland by wind.

02:50.280 --> 02:54.367
On reaching mountains,
the moisture is forced upwards

02:54.491 --> 02:59.913
and as it cools, it condenses
into cloud and finally rain -

03:00.037 --> 03:03.249
the source of all fresh water.

03:13.676 --> 03:18.764
There is a tropical downpour here
almost every day of the year.

03:30.399 --> 03:35.487
Fresh water's journey starts here,
high in the mountains.

03:52.336 --> 03:55.589
Growing from humble streams
to mighty rivers

03:55.714 --> 03:59.426
it will travel hundreds
of miles to the sea.

04:37.795 --> 04:42.341
Angel Falls,
the highest waterfall in the world.

04:56.854 --> 05:02.067
Its waters drop unbroken
for almost a thousand meters.

05:11.409 --> 05:13.452
Such is the height of these falls

05:13.578 --> 05:18.040
that long before the water reaches
the base in the Devil's Canyon

05:18.123 --> 05:21.376
it's blown away as a fine mist.

05:53.781 --> 05:55.407
In their upper reaches,

05:55.533 --> 05:58.995
mountain streams are full of energy.

06:01.747 --> 06:04.749
Streams join to form rivers,

06:04.875 --> 06:06.334
building in power,

06:06.460 --> 06:08.337
creating rapids.

06:18.596 --> 06:20.723
The water here is cold.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.393
Low in nutrients, but high in oxygen.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.524
The few creatures
that live in the torrent

06:30.649 --> 06:33.400
have to hang on for dear life.

06:35.570 --> 06:38.739
Invertebrates dominate
these upper reaches.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.618
The hellgrammite, its body flattened
to reduce drag,

06:42.785 --> 06:47.164
has bushy gills to extract
oxygen from the current.

06:51.501 --> 06:56.130
Black fly larvae anchor themselves
with the ring of hooks,

06:59.550 --> 07:01.552
but if these become unstuck,

07:01.677 --> 07:05.347
they're still held
by a silicon safety line.

07:18.776 --> 07:22.529
There are advantages to life in the fast stream -

07:22.655 --> 07:26.659
bamboo shrimps can just sit
and sift out passing particles

07:26.783 --> 07:29.078
with their fan-like forearms.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.765
Usually, these mountain streams
only provide enough food

07:52.891 --> 07:55.684
for small animals to survive.

07:55.894 --> 07:59.147
But with the spring melt here in Japan

07:59.272 --> 08:02.733
monsters stir in their dens.

08:10.908 --> 08:15.370
Giant salamanders, world's largest amphibian,

08:15.495 --> 08:18.248
almost two meters long.

08:21.417 --> 08:25.880
They're the only large predator
in these icy waters.

08:30.008 --> 08:32.886
They begin their hunt
at night.

08:48.025 --> 08:52.529
These salamanders have
an exceptionally slow metabolism.

08:52.654 --> 08:56.866
Living up to 80 years
they grow into giants.

09:14.007 --> 09:16.802
The fish they hunt are scarce

09:16.926 --> 09:20.097
and salamanders have poor eyesight.

09:23.016 --> 09:25.893
But sensory nodes
on their head and body

09:25.977 --> 09:29.771
detect the slightest changes
in water pressure.

09:41.241 --> 09:43.158
Free from competition,

09:43.284 --> 09:46.579
these giants can dine alone.

10:00.175 --> 10:03.845
Pickings are usually thin
for the salamanders,

10:04.012 --> 10:06.847
but every year some
of the world's high rivers

10:06.974 --> 10:10.559
are crowded by millions of visitors.

10:17.899 --> 10:20.527
The salmon have arrived.

10:28.200 --> 10:32.956
This is the world's largest
fresh water fish migration.

10:37.083 --> 10:38.794
Across the northern hemisphere

10:38.918 --> 10:42.631
salmon, returning from the ocean
to their spawning grounds,

10:42.755 --> 10:46.425
battle their way
for hundreds of miles upstream.

10:51.472 --> 10:56.393
Up here, there are fewer predators
to eat their eggs and fry.

11:24.628 --> 11:27.213
A grizzly bear.

11:29.298 --> 11:31.342
From famine to feast -

11:31.551 --> 11:33.552
he's spoilt for choice.

11:40.684 --> 11:43.353
This Canadian bear is very special -

11:43.479 --> 11:46.731
he's learnt to dive for his dinner.

12:01.704 --> 12:05.666
But catching salmon in deep water
is not that easy

12:05.790 --> 12:08.585
and the cubs have lots to learn.

12:46.453 --> 12:49.080
The annual arrival
of spawning salmon

12:49.206 --> 12:52.750
brings huge quantities
of food into these high rivers

12:52.876 --> 12:55.962
that normally struggle
to support much life.

13:09.349 --> 13:11.434
Although relatively lifeless,

13:11.559 --> 13:14.812
the power of the upland rivers
to shape the landscape

13:14.937 --> 13:18.941
is greater than any other stage
in a river's life.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.569
Driven by gravity,

13:22.654 --> 13:26.323
they're the most erosive forces
on the planet.

13:30.535 --> 13:33.372
For the past 5 million years

13:33.496 --> 13:38.376
Arizona's Colorado river
has eaten away at the desert's sandstone

13:38.460 --> 13:41.545
to create a gigantic canyon.

13:52.471 --> 13:54.640
It's over a mile deep

13:54.724 --> 13:59.436
and at its widest
it's 17 miles across.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.950
The Grand Canyon.

14:35.178 --> 14:40.016
This river has cut
the world's longest canyon system -

14:40.099 --> 14:45.312
a 1,000 mile scar
clearly visible from space.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.590
As rivers leave the mountains behind,

15:14.673 --> 15:19.719
they gradually warm
and begin to support more life.

15:28.269 --> 15:33.523
Indian rivers are home
to the world's most social otter -

15:34.358 --> 15:39.821
smooth-coated otters
form family groups up to 17 strong.

15:51.081 --> 15:54.876
Group rubbing not only
refreshes their coats,

15:54.960 --> 15:58.046
but strengthens social bonds.

16:07.721 --> 16:09.348
When it comes to fishing

16:09.431 --> 16:12.768
there is real strength in numbers.

16:25.613 --> 16:30.576
Fishing practice begins
when the cubs are four months old.

16:49.426 --> 16:55.515
Only the adults have the speed
and agility needed to make a catch.

17:34.051 --> 17:38.640
Adults share their catches
with their squabbling cubs.

17:49.732 --> 17:51.984
Most otters are solitary,

17:52.151 --> 17:57.365
but these rich warm waters
can support large family groups

17:57.823 --> 18:00.284
and even bigger predators.

18:19.885 --> 18:25.974
Mugger crocodiles, four meters long,
could easily take a single otter.

18:51.915 --> 18:54.499
But, confident in their gangs,

18:54.584 --> 18:59.046
the otters will actively harass
these great reptiles.

19:16.854 --> 19:19.691
Team play wins the day.

19:30.575 --> 19:32.160
The Mara river,

19:32.286 --> 19:35.913
snaking across the plains
of East Africa.

19:37.916 --> 19:39.625
As the land flattens out

19:39.751 --> 19:43.462
rivers slow down
and lose their destructive power.

19:44.297 --> 19:47.800
Now they are carrying
heavy loads of sediment

19:47.882 --> 19:50.469
that stains their waters brown.

20:03.730 --> 20:07.442
Lines of wildebeest are on their march.

20:12.279 --> 20:17.744
Each year nearly two million animals
migrate across the Serengeti plains

20:17.827 --> 20:21.122
in search of fresh green pastures.

20:21.247 --> 20:22.956
For these thirsty herds

20:23.082 --> 20:26.585
the rivers are not only
a vital source of drinking water,

20:26.709 --> 20:29.838
but also dangerous obstacles.

20:49.564 --> 20:55.695
This is one of the largest concentrations
of Nile crocodiles in Africa,

20:55.987 --> 20:59.740
giants that grow over five meters long.

21:16.215 --> 21:19.884
From memory, the wildebeest are coming

21:20.010 --> 21:22.761
and gather in anticipation.

22:27.696 --> 22:32.034
The crocodile's jaws
snap tight like a steel trap -

22:32.118 --> 22:35.037
once they have a hold,
they never let go.

22:48.048 --> 22:52.720
It took over an hour
to drown this full-grown bull.

23:00.978 --> 23:02.938
To surprise their prey

23:03.062 --> 23:07.233
crocodiles must strike
with lightning speed.

23:32.381 --> 23:39.429
Here, only the narrowest line
separates life from death.

24:15.629 --> 24:18.340
Most rivers drain into the sea,

24:18.466 --> 24:22.885
but some end their journey
in vast lakes.

24:25.805 --> 24:32.353
Worldwide lakes hold twenty times
more fresh water than all the rivers.

24:34.438 --> 24:39.526
The East African Rift Valley
holds three of the world's largest:

24:39.610 --> 24:44.030
Malawi, Tanganyika, and Victoria.

24:45.782 --> 24:48.575
Lake Malawi, the smallest of the three,

24:48.660 --> 24:51.162
is still bigger than Wales.

25:04.382 --> 25:08.261
Its tropical waters teem
with more fish species

25:08.386 --> 25:10.179
than any other lake.

25:10.930 --> 25:14.433
There are 850 different cichlids alone,

25:14.517 --> 25:18.103
all of which evolved
from just one single ancestor

25:18.187 --> 25:21.606
isolated here thousands of years ago.

25:36.287 --> 25:41.208
These two-meter wide craters
are fish-made.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.595
Fastidiously maintained by the males,

25:53.678 --> 25:56.763
these bowls are courtship arenas.

26:09.985 --> 26:13.780
Cichlids are caring parents.

26:17.324 --> 26:22.371
Brooding young in the mouth
is a very effective way of protecting them.

26:23.914 --> 26:27.125
This lake can be a dangerous place.

26:39.720 --> 26:47.019
After dark, predatory dolphin fish
emerge from their daytime lairs among the rocks.

26:51.689 --> 26:57.111
Like packs of sharks,
they're on the prowl for sleeping cichlids.

27:04.326 --> 27:07.954
In the darkness these electric fish hunt

27:08.038 --> 27:13.836
by detecting distortions in the electric
field they create around their bodies.

27:32.477 --> 27:37.065
Any cichlid that trenches out
will be snapped up.

27:58.625 --> 28:05.091
The floor of Lake Malawi
drops 700 meters into an abyss.

28:12.597 --> 28:14.516
Here, in this dead zone

28:14.599 --> 28:19.187
the larvae of lake fly midges
hide out away from predators.

28:22.857 --> 28:25.734
In the rainy season
they balloon up to the surface

28:25.859 --> 28:28.987
and undergo a magical transformation.

28:38.955 --> 28:43.709
At dawn the first adult midges
start to break out.

28:47.671 --> 28:52.008
Soon, millions upon millions
of newly hatched lake flies

28:52.092 --> 28:53.927
are taking to the wing.

29:04.603 --> 29:10.191
Early explorers told tales
of lakes that smoked, as if on fire.

29:11.777 --> 29:15.781
But these spiraling columns
hundreds if meters high

29:15.905 --> 29:17.949
are mating flies.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.131
Once the flies have mated,

29:34.256 --> 29:36.633
they will all drop
to the water surface,

29:36.758 --> 29:39.886
release their eggs and die.

29:49.770 --> 29:52.940
Malawi may look like an inland sea,

29:53.065 --> 29:57.319
but it's dwarfed
by the world's largest lake -

29:58.445 --> 30:02.031
Baikal in Eastern Siberia.

30:12.457 --> 30:15.627
400 miles long and over a mile deep,

30:15.752 --> 30:19.130
Baikal contains one fifth
of all the fresh water

30:19.256 --> 30:22.425
found in our planet's
lakes and rivers.

30:25.553 --> 30:31.725
For five months of the year
it's sealed by an ice sheet over a meter thick.

30:47.573 --> 30:50.450
Baikal is the oldest lake in the world

30:50.576 --> 30:56.665
and, despite the harsh conditions,
life flourishes here in isolation.

30:57.957 --> 31:01.545
80 percent of its species
are found nowhere else on Earth,

31:01.628 --> 31:06.006
including the world's
only fresh water seal.

31:12.847 --> 31:14.098
With this seal

31:14.181 --> 31:16.976
and its marine-like forests of sponges

31:17.059 --> 31:20.812
Baikal seems more like
an ocean than a lake.

31:40.248 --> 31:46.670
There are shrimp-like crustaceans -
giant amphipods - as large as mice.

31:52.551 --> 31:56.054
They are the key scavengers
in this lake.

31:56.136 --> 32:02.392
The water here is just too cold for the bacteria
that normally decompose the dead.

32:16.322 --> 32:19.659
Most rivers do not end in lakes

32:19.784 --> 32:22.578
but continue their journey
to the sea.

32:27.833 --> 32:33.213
The planet's indisputable super-river
is the Amazon.

32:34.963 --> 32:41.427
It carries as much water
as the next top-ten biggest rivers combined.

32:44.431 --> 32:50.769
Rising in the Peruvian Andes,
its main trunk flows eastwards across Brazil.

32:50.937 --> 32:55.816
On its way the system drains
a third of South America.

32:56.942 --> 33:00.821
Eventually, over 4,000 miles
from its source,

33:00.904 --> 33:04.283
it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

33:11.831 --> 33:16.127
The Amazon transports
a billion tons of sediment a year,

33:16.252 --> 33:20.339
sediment clearly visible
at the mixing of the waters

33:20.465 --> 33:26.011
where one massive tributary,
the Rio Negro, flows into the main river.

33:32.267 --> 33:34.895
Its waters are wonderfully rich.

33:34.978 --> 33:39.398
To date over 3,000 species
of their fish have been described -

33:39.482 --> 33:42.693
more than in the whole
of the Atlantic Ocean.

34:11.344 --> 34:14.639
The Amazon is so large
and rich in fish

34:14.723 --> 34:18.016
that it can support
fresh water dolphins.

34:18.101 --> 34:23.563
These botos are huge -
two and a half meters long.

34:25.482 --> 34:31.279
In these murky waters they rely
on sonar to navigate and hunt.

34:49.045 --> 34:54.051
They work together to drive
shoals of fish into the shallows.

35:57.692 --> 35:59.694
Botos are highly social

35:59.819 --> 36:04.657
and in the breeding season
there is stiff competition for mates.

36:04.865 --> 36:08.494
The males hold court
in a unique way.

36:19.963 --> 36:22.507
They pick up rocks in their jaws

36:22.632 --> 36:25.843
and flaunt them
to their attending females.

36:30.556 --> 36:34.851
Maybe each male is trying to show
how strong and dexterous he is

36:34.976 --> 36:40.314
and that he therefore is the best father
a female could have for her young.

36:51.659 --> 36:55.787
Successful displays lead to mating.

37:10.635 --> 37:13.470
Even for giant rivers like the Amazon

37:13.596 --> 37:19.142
the journey to the sea
is not always smooth or uninterrupted.

37:47.293 --> 37:51.756
Iguassu Falls on the border
of Brazil and Argentina

37:51.881 --> 37:54.925
is one of the widest waterfalls
in the world -

37:55.008 --> 37:58.053
one and a half miles across.

38:04.560 --> 38:10.606
In flood 30 million liters
of water spill over every second.

38:58.150 --> 39:01.612
All the world's
great broad waterfalls:

39:01.695 --> 39:05.574
Victoria, Niagara and here, Iguassu,

39:05.699 --> 39:09.661
are only found
in the lower courses of their rivers.

39:17.794 --> 39:19.503
In their final stages

39:19.628 --> 39:24.549
rivers broaden and flow wearily
across their flat flood plains.

39:25.508 --> 39:27.719
Each wet season here, in Brazil,

39:27.844 --> 39:30.555
the Parana river overflows its banks

39:30.639 --> 39:33.850
and floods an area
the size of England.

39:37.562 --> 39:38.897
The Pantanal -

39:38.979 --> 39:42.023
the world's largest wetland.

39:49.156 --> 39:53.702
In these slow-flowing waters
aquatic plants flourish

39:53.869 --> 39:59.040
like the Victoria giant water lily
with leaves two meters across.

40:22.645 --> 40:27.773
These underwater forests
are nursery grounds for fish.

40:29.359 --> 40:34.656
Over 300 species breed here,
including red-bellied piranha

40:39.327 --> 40:43.789
and other predators,
like the spectacle caiman.

41:10.730 --> 41:14.359
Ripening fig trees
overhanging the water's edge

41:14.442 --> 41:18.113
provide welcome food
for shoals of hungry fish.

41:25.036 --> 41:27.829
The commotion attracts dorado,

41:27.955 --> 41:31.374
known locally as the river tiger.

41:39.007 --> 41:41.466
They patrol the feeding shoals,

41:41.593 --> 41:44.512
looking for a chance to strike.

42:22.755 --> 42:24.548
And waiting in the wings,

42:24.673 --> 42:27.509
ready to pick off any injured fish,

42:27.634 --> 42:29.595
are the piranhas.

42:41.856 --> 42:45.193
The feeding frenzy quickly develops.

43:03.334 --> 43:07.672
Piranha can strip a fish
to the bone in minutes.

43:14.386 --> 43:20.725
Great numbers of fish
sustain vast flocks of water birds.

43:23.686 --> 43:31.277
The rose-eared spoonbill is just one of the 650
bird species found in the Pantanal.

43:38.366 --> 43:44.080
They nest alongside wood stocks
in colonies thousands strong.

44:13.023 --> 44:15.734
Spectacle caiman linger below,

44:15.859 --> 44:18.903
waiting for a meal
to fall out of the sky.

45:16.707 --> 45:18.792
When rivers finally reach the sea

45:18.917 --> 45:23.713
they slow down, release
their sediment and build deltas.

45:25.632 --> 45:29.761
In Bangladesh the Ganges
and Brahmaputra rivers join

45:29.844 --> 45:31.972
to form the world's biggest.

45:34.723 --> 45:39.353
Every year almost 2 thousand
million tons of sediment

45:39.437 --> 45:43.398
eroded from the Himalayas
is delivered to the ocean.

45:48.529 --> 45:53.032
At the delta's mouth -
the largest mangrove forest in the world,

45:53.116 --> 45:54.951
the Sundarbans.

46:01.539 --> 46:05.835
These extraordinary forests
spring up throughout the tropics

46:05.919 --> 46:09.464
in these tidal zones
where rivers meet the sea.

46:20.057 --> 46:23.644
Crab-eating macaques
are mangrove specials.

46:28.022 --> 46:35.196
In Indonesia these monkeys have
adopted a unique amphibious lifestyle -

46:42.328 --> 46:45.162
they fish out fallen food.

47:09.102 --> 47:15.066
The troop also uses the waters
to cool off during the heat of the day.

47:19.820 --> 47:25.284
But the channels are also the playground
for restless young macaques.

47:30.997 --> 47:35.460
Some of the young have even taken
to underwater swimming.

47:41.132 --> 47:44.134
They can stay down
for more than 30 seconds

47:44.260 --> 47:47.345
and appear to do this
just for fun.

47:59.940 --> 48:03.985
Yet these swimming skills
acquired during play

48:04.070 --> 48:09.700
will certainly be useful later in life
in these flooded mangrove forests.

48:18.249 --> 48:22.128
In cooler climes, mud, laid down in estuaries,

48:22.211 --> 48:25.297
is colonized by salt marsh grasses

48:25.381 --> 48:29.259
and form one of the most
productive habitats on the planet.

48:59.537 --> 49:07.002
400,000 greater snow geese flock to the estuaries
along the Atlantic coast of the United States

49:07.170 --> 49:11.632
to rest and refuel
on their long migratory journeys.

49:49.040 --> 49:52.461
This is the end of the river's journey.

49:52.544 --> 49:55.297
Collectively they've
worn down mountains

49:55.380 --> 49:57.174
and carried them to the sea.

49:57.257 --> 49:58.675
And all along the way,

49:58.800 --> 50:04.096
their fresh water has brought life
and abundance to planet Earth.
