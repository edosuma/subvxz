00:25.600 --> 00:27.100
I'm going to sleep
on the couch.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.700
she sure loves that couch.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.400
It's the world series
of kickball...

00:36.400 --> 00:38.100
bart simpson on the mound.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.600
The catcher gives him
the signal...

00:42.800 --> 00:44.800
...And here's the pitch!

00:54.200 --> 00:57.800
oh, my god!
I've shredded a child!

00:57.800 --> 00:59.300
Again!

00:59.300 --> 01:00.900
( Screaming )

01:00.900 --> 01:03.800
venezuela, here I come!

01:03.800 --> 01:06.000
And while the school's only ball
is being repaired...

01:06.000 --> 01:08.400
the following alternative sports
will be offered:

01:08.400 --> 01:11.700
Dodge-rock, volley-brick
and base-game.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.100
I want to play dodge-rock!

01:14.100 --> 01:15.000
You're out.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.100
Finally, on a personal note,
mrs. Krabappel and i

01:18.100 --> 01:20.400
are to be joined in
holy wedlock this saturday.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.800
We'll be honeymooning
at lake shelbyville lodge,

01:22.800 --> 01:24.400
cabin 32, room three.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.500
And we do not wish
to be disturbed.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.100
Way to go, mrs. K!

01:28.100 --> 01:29.600
You finally hooked
the skinfish.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.700
It looks good...

01:30.700 --> 01:33.400
but I'm not going to celebrate
till he's gaffed, gutted

01:33.400 --> 01:35.700
and hanging in my trophy
room. Ha!

01:35.700 --> 01:38.400
We have the same dream, ma'am.

01:38.400 --> 01:41.900
My bonnie lies over
the ocean

01:41.900 --> 01:44.700
my bonnie lies
over the sea...

01:44.700 --> 01:48.300
( chuckles )

01:48.300 --> 01:49.000
all right,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
we got sex with
an alligator,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
screaming orgasms
and virgin screaming orgasms.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.400
Ooh, sexy drinks,
adult board games...

01:59.800 --> 02:01.500
I'm glad I sent the kids
to grampa's

02:01.500 --> 02:03.700
to protect their innocent minds.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.800
..And here's some more germans
we killed.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.000
That flame-thrower really
toasted their waffles.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.200
( Disgusted groans )

02:11.200 --> 02:13.900
grampa, how do you
sleep at night?

02:13.900 --> 02:15.800
They drug us.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.500
It'S... another pair
of edible panties!

02:19.500 --> 02:20.600
( Girlish hoots )

02:20.600 --> 02:24.600
now, that's sexual.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.200
( Glass squeaking )

02:27.200 --> 02:28.700
( slurping )

02:28.700 --> 02:31.400
homer, this bachelor party
seems to have peaked.

02:31.400 --> 02:34.200
Would you please return
my pants and/or underpants

02:34.200 --> 02:35.100
so I can go home?

02:35.100 --> 02:37.400
Come on, it's your last
night of freedom.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.800
You got to have some fun.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.700
O are all of you people?

02:40.700 --> 02:42.600
We're your buddies.
Now, come on,

02:42.600 --> 02:44.900
homer's kids' principal,
have a beer.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.500
I can't-- I might be called upon
to give directions later.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.600
Skinner!

02:48.600 --> 02:52.600
You were asked to chug-a-lug,
and a-lug you shall chug!

02:53.900 --> 02:57.600
( Gulping )

02:57.600 --> 02:58.600
( drunkenly ):
There's something

02:58.600 --> 03:00.800
I've wanted
to say to you

03:00.800 --> 03:03.400
for a long time.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.400
Am I a good principal?

03:05.400 --> 03:08.600
You're the best we could get
with the funds at our disposal.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.900
( Cheering )

03:10.900 --> 03:14.500
delivering these ice-cold
lady duffs has made me hot.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.100
Really hot.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.600
( "Duffman theme" playing )

03:20.600 --> 03:22.800
come on, duffman.
( Hooting )

03:22.800 --> 03:25.000
30 bucks an hour-- oh, yeah!

03:25.000 --> 03:27.300
Ah, ooh, ah!
Oh, yeah!

03:27.300 --> 03:29.600
( Doorbell ringing )

03:29.600 --> 03:32.500
sorry to bother you, but
we got an anonymous tip

03:32.500 --> 03:36.500
about loud music and a
strip-da-didilly-dipper.

03:38.300 --> 03:42.300
Oh, look, girls,
a policeman is here.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.000
Well, we've been
awfully naughty.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.200
You'd better lay down the law.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.000
( Dance music playing )
( hollering )

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
hey, ladies, ladies,
I-I really am a cop.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.700
Whoa. Is that a five?

03:55.700 --> 03:59.700
Well, this uniform
is a little snug.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.400
Oh, yeah, ha-ha, whoo!

04:04.900 --> 04:07.300
Uh, eddie, lou, how about
a little backup here?

04:07.300 --> 04:10.400
Hmm, hmm, like what
you see, ladies?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.900
All right. Hmm, hmm.
Wiggum:

04:12.900 --> 04:14.300
Oh, yeah.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.000
Oh, okay. Uh, can we,
uh... can we...

04:17.000 --> 04:18.899
I think I-I threw
my back out.

04:18.899 --> 04:22.900
( Gulping )
( slurping )

04:23.200 --> 04:26.400
you know, I wish I had
an exciting life,

04:26.400 --> 04:29.000
like that class
picture photographer.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.400
Oh! How many women
has he had in that van?

04:32.400 --> 04:34.100
Two that I know of.

04:34.100 --> 04:38.100
Let's kick this up a notch and
get you some wiggle in your lap.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.500
Oh, yeah.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.000
No. Absolutely
no friction dancing.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.300
Oh, come on,
you killjoy!

04:46.300 --> 04:47.400
Wussy.
Grinch.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.800
Hey, take it easy
on skinner.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.500
He's just down 'cause
after tomorrow,

04:52.500 --> 04:54.800
everything he does
is wrong.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.500
Oh, marriage is
gonna be great.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.600
Now you'll have someone
who'll rub your back...

04:58.600 --> 05:02.200
without being asked.
Aah, not this again.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.700
Yes, this again.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.300
You know, homer, edna was

05:05.300 --> 05:08.000
bugging me and bugging me
to set a date,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.200
and I picked one
that seemed far away,

05:11.200 --> 05:15.100
and it zoomed up like a june bug
flying at my windshield.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.700
What are you trying
to tell me, skinner?

05:16.700 --> 05:18.900
( Gulping )

05:18.900 --> 05:20.400
ah...
homer...

05:20.400 --> 05:24.400
lenny...
my man...

05:25.500 --> 05:28.400
I could never lie to you guys.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.500
I'M... I'm starting
to get cold feet.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.900
Please don't tell anyone.
Don't worry.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.100
Your secret's safe with me.
Marge, guess what?

05:36.100 --> 05:38.200
Skinner wants to bail
on his wedding.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.100
Homer, you're still
talking to me.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.200
Oh, man, it's
just awkward.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.300
I'm out of here.

05:44.300 --> 05:48.300
( Gulping )
( groans )

05:48.500 --> 05:51.000
principal skinner is having
second thoughts?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Poor edna.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.700
Yeah, marge, it looks like
you got the last perfect man.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.400
Oh, by the way, can i
borrow your car tomorrow?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.700
Mine's acting up.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.600
( Marge gasps )
( annoyed murmur )

06:02.600 --> 06:05.300
every day you find
a new way to aggravate me.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.400
Hey, you're the one
always bugging me

06:07.400 --> 06:11.200
to screw up our marriage.
Spice up! Spice up!

06:11.200 --> 06:12.200
Whatever.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.000
The important thing is to
get skinner to that altar,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.700
because once a union has
been sanctified by god,

06:17.700 --> 06:20.900
it takes at least six months
to tear it apart.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.200
Right, naked duffman?
Hmm?

06:23.200 --> 06:27.200
Oh, uh... oh, yeah!

06:30.500 --> 06:33.200
( Playing "pachelbel's canon" )

06:33.200 --> 06:35.600
I think skinner might make
a run for it.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.600
He's eyeing the exits
and doing calf stretches.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.600
Don't worry, I've got a man
on the perimeter.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.500
Cowabunga one to fat load.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.800
This is fat load.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.800
I'd like to request
a new code name.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.300
Denied.
Okay, fat load here.

06:51.300 --> 06:55.300
Here comes the bride.
Repeat. Here comes the bride.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.300
Mrs. K.,
You look awesome.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.400
Thank you, otto.

07:00.400 --> 07:04.400
That cloud looks awesome.
That rock looks awesome.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.500
My hands look awesome.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.500
( Playing "the wedding march" )

07:22.600 --> 07:23.800
hey, champ.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.200
Ready to take
the plunge?

07:25.200 --> 07:27.000
You know I'm not.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.600
We had a long discussion
about that

07:28.600 --> 07:32.600
where I clearly indicated
the coldness of my feet.

07:34.900 --> 07:38.100
Happy 50th anniversary,
seymour.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.500
I was thinking
it might be time

07:39.500 --> 07:42.900
to combine our
cd collections.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.700
I don't know, edna.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.700
I'm not quite ready
to take that plunge.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.400
Seymour!

07:49.400 --> 07:51.800
My larval sac
fell in the toilet.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.200
Go fish it out.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.200
Quick, edna.
I'll use your purse as a scoop.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.300
Well, this is it, edna.

07:59.300 --> 08:02.300
As I once said at
the battle of khe sanh,

08:02.300 --> 08:06.300
"I surrender."

08:07.900 --> 08:09.600
We are gathered together today

08:09.600 --> 08:13.600
to join seymour and edna
in holy matrimony.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.600
Does anyone present
know any reason

08:16.600 --> 08:20.600
why these two should not be wed?

08:21.300 --> 08:23.400
I do.
( All gasp )

08:23.400 --> 08:27.400
no, you say that part later.
I'm sorry, seymour.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I can't marry someone
who doesn't want to be with me.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
( Cries )
( crying )

08:35.900 --> 08:39.900
we got a runner.
Snipers, take your shot.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.500
I can't do it.
That dress is a vera wang.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Edna!
Mm...

08:49.800 --> 08:50.600
( sniffing )

08:50.600 --> 08:54.600
is this corn oil?
Canola.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.400
He drove her to it you know.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.900
She was only doing it
for the appliances.

08:58.900 --> 09:01.400
He's a she.
She's a he.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.700
They're both, both.
( Clears throat )

09:03.700 --> 09:07.300
well, I'm afraid edna has gone
from tardy to absent.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.700
( Nervous chuckling )

09:09.700 --> 09:12.900
so let's move onto the reception
and forget this awkwardness

09:12.900 --> 09:16.900
with some delicious
shrimp mocktail.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.700
Principal skinner,
I feel so bad for you.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.600
Well, in retrospect,
I could've been a little more

09:24.600 --> 09:26.800
"into" the whole thing.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
Just the two of us
building castles...

09:30.800 --> 09:33.700
( sighs ):
"Just the two of us."

09:33.700 --> 09:36.700
I spent $15
on those dance lessons,

09:36.700 --> 09:37.700
might as well use them.

09:37.700 --> 09:45.100
Forward, side, together.
Back, side, together.

09:45.100 --> 09:49.100
this is so sad.
Yeah, he's crazy all right.

09:49.800 --> 09:51.000
All right, students,

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
what is the center
of the circulatory system?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.200
It's the heart.
The heart?

09:57.200 --> 09:58.900
You mean like
principal skinner's,

09:58.900 --> 10:01.700
which you broke?
What do you care?

10:01.700 --> 10:05.500
You hate principal skinner.
Eh, bro's before ho'S.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.400
Nelson, I'll see you
after class.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.900
I'll be there.
Will you?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.300
( Bell rings )

10:12.300 --> 10:14.200
mom, what are you
doing here?

10:14.200 --> 10:17.000
Did our house burn down?
Oh, that'd be cool.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.500
No, I'm here to have
a little girl-talk

10:19.500 --> 10:21.400
with mrs. Krabappel.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.800
So how are you
holding up?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.200
Actually, I feel fine.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.500
Why should I settle for someone
who's not passionate about me?

10:27.500 --> 10:29.700
Oh, passion's for teens
and immigrants.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.100
I'm just glad to have
someone to look at

10:32.100 --> 10:33.800
when I wake up
in the morning.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.800
Really?
Well...

10:39.900 --> 10:42.400
unkink the hose.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.200
Hmm...

10:43.200 --> 10:45.300
sure there
are downsides.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.200
But a relationship
can't be

10:47.200 --> 10:50.200
all hand-holding and
restaurant desserts.

10:50.200 --> 10:50.900
Why not?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.800
If I can't have romance
and excitement,

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
then what's the point
of being married?

10:54.800 --> 10:58.800
Well, it'S...
in my case... hmm...

11:01.500 --> 11:05.500
oh, god, I've lost
the love of my life.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.200
Bart's right,
I am a wiener.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.300
( Sobbing )

11:11.300 --> 11:14.400
geez, homer, this guy is
bringing the whole bar down.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.900
I finally got barney
back on the sauce.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.400
If he doesn't have fun,
he could easily slip

11:19.400 --> 11:21.600
right back into sobriety.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.600
Don't worry.
If I feel the urge to sober up,

11:24.600 --> 11:28.600
I'll just talk to my sponsor.
Drink or I'll die.

11:33.200 --> 11:33.900
Wait a minute.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.800
I thought you didn't
want to get married.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.700
That was before I missed
her smell, her warmth,

11:39.700 --> 11:43.700
her beautiful,
beautiful penmanship.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.600
Don't worry,
principal skinner.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.700
Seymour.
Really?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
Boy, it sucks to be you.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.500
Anyhoo, if there's
one thing I know,

11:50.500 --> 11:52.800
it's how to win back
a furious woman.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.500
We'll go to her house,
and I'll whisper to you

11:55.500 --> 11:58.000
exactly what to say.
Really?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.600
You'll be my cyrano?
Hey, if we get

12:00.600 --> 12:02.700
your girlfriend back
I won't have to.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.200
Okay, just repeat after me.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.600
"Edna, I made
a huge mistake

12:07.600 --> 12:09.300
and I want you back."

12:09.300 --> 12:13.300
Edna, I made a huge mistake
and I want you back.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.800
How's that, homer?
Mm-hmm.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.500
Oh, god, it's seymour.
What do I say?

12:19.500 --> 12:22.400
You just say...
it's too late.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.000
I'm free and loving it,
principal skinner.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.100
( Whispering ):
Hey, tell her...

12:29.100 --> 12:30.300
every second without you

12:30.300 --> 12:32.500
is like a million kicks
in the crotch.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.900
Oh, that's so lovely.
"But it's too late

12:35.900 --> 12:38.000
to win us back
with sweet talk."

12:38.000 --> 12:41.300
What the...? Marge?
Are you helping her?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.800
I won't let edna
throw her life away

12:43.800 --> 12:46.200
for some passionless
marriage

12:46.200 --> 12:49.700
where two people lie in bed
together with no contact,

12:49.700 --> 12:53.000
whittling away the batteries
until they die.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.700
Which are you saying is dead?
Our marriage or our batteries?

12:56.700 --> 13:00.700
Let's just say in an emergency,
I wouldn't count on either one.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.300
Homer, marge,

13:02.300 --> 13:04.400
if I could just speak
to edna for a moment.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.100
Shut up.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.500
I didn't tell you
to say that.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.300
Just why am I taking
your advice?

13:08.300 --> 13:11.400
Because I'm successfully
married.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.500
There's no ring on that finger.
Uh-oh.

13:13.500 --> 13:17.500
Oh, why did I take it off?
Oh, right.

13:19.100 --> 13:23.100
To see if I could skip it
across lake michigan.

13:23.900 --> 13:26.200
I'm here to return the gift
you brought to our wedding.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.400
Ah, yes.
An incredible hulk melon baller.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.200
( Growls )

13:31.200 --> 13:32.900
( growling )

13:32.900 --> 13:34.500
( growls )

13:34.500 --> 13:37.300
well, I'm glad you'll
be able to enjoy it.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.500
I think you did the right thing.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.500
You didn't want your life
to turn out like this.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.000
( Chuckling )

13:45.000 --> 13:46.600
oh, you're cute.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.500
Is there
a mrs. Comic book guy?

13:49.500 --> 13:53.500
Well, I was married once...
in an online fantasy game.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.200
We were thinking
of having children,

13:55.200 --> 13:58.300
but that would have severely
drained my power crystals.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.400
( Chuckling )

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
stop it, you big kidder.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.800
( Forced laughter )

14:02.800 --> 14:04.500
yes, "kidder."

14:04.500 --> 14:06.100
Would you like
to get some coffee?

14:06.100 --> 14:10.100
And a family bucket
of chicken.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.400
We've made it to my car
and you haven't left.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.800
A new record.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.700
Oh, I love your black
tinted windows.

14:18.700 --> 14:21.000
Actually, they're trash bags.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.000
Now, could you give me
a pushing start?

14:25.000 --> 14:27.300
string quartet,
are you tuned up?

14:27.300 --> 14:29.700
As tuned as we're going
to get in this humidity.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.000
And the castrati?
The what now?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.400
And a one and a two and A...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.200
( to the tune of "a-wimoweh" )
oh, edna k, oh, edna k,

14:36.200 --> 14:42.400
oh, edna k, oh, edna k 
oh, edna k, oh, edna k

14:42.400 --> 14:46.200
ms. Krabappel,
a sad principal

14:46.200 --> 14:50.200
is desperate and needy

14:50.200 --> 14:52.000
if you come home,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
I won't die alone 
and that's what I'd prefer

14:57.700 --> 15:03.700
uh-plee-ee-ee-eease
settle for seymour

15:05.500 --> 15:11.500
so plee-ee-ee-eease
come back to the dork

15:16.300 --> 15:19.800
well, well, if it isn't
the square in our love triangle.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.200
What are you doing
in edna's place? Where is she?

15:22.200 --> 15:24.400
My beloved is napping blissfully

15:24.400 --> 15:28.400
in the many folds
of my spider-man t-shirt.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.300
As for myself,

15:30.300 --> 15:33.500
I am popping kettle corn.
This can't be happening!

15:33.500 --> 15:36.100
Oh, but it can.
I adore edna.

15:36.100 --> 15:39.400
She is near-mint and comes from
a very limited edition--

15:39.400 --> 15:42.400
females who will talk to me.
Give her back to skinner.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.800
A fat, bald guy like you...
you could have anyone.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.300
Forget you.
Edna and I are in love.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.300
We're doing everything together.
Breakfast, bath,

15:52.300 --> 15:55.600
and then the bi-monthly
science fiction convention.

15:55.600 --> 15:56.600
Join me.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.500
The bi-mon sci-fi con?!

15:58.500 --> 16:00.100
You've heard of it?
Is it romantic?

16:00.100 --> 16:01.900
Hey, women have put out
just to get out of there.

16:01.900 --> 16:04.000
( Growls )

16:04.000 --> 16:06.100
edna's with comic book guy?

16:06.100 --> 16:09.100
Oh, god, she's
on the rebound.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.200
And you meet the worst guys
on the rebound.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.900
It's how
jackie got her "O."

16:13.900 --> 16:15.600
Okay, we'll go
to the convention,

16:15.600 --> 16:18.400
sell my lois lane comics,
buy some jimmy olsens,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.900
and stop edna from making
a terrible mistake.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.200
I wish you'd devote this
much time and attention

16:23.200 --> 16:24.900
to our relationship.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.200
Don't worry, marge.
We'll get something to eat.

16:28.200 --> 16:29.600
( Groans )

16:29.600 --> 16:33.300
Warning, you could be photographed
and used in ads... looking like that

16:33.300 --> 16:36.100
I don't see skinner anywhere.
He's probably in costume--

16:36.100 --> 16:38.100
he could be any of these people.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.500
They're all too old to be
dressed up like super-people.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.600
Homer, let's just hurry up
and go home

16:43.600 --> 16:44.900
so I can yell at you.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.400
Oh, my goodness,
it's matt groening!

16:47.400 --> 16:48.900
( Laughs )

16:48.900 --> 16:51.400
wow, the creator
of futurama!

16:51.400 --> 16:55.300
Mr. Groening, will you
autograph my bender doll?

16:55.300 --> 16:58.300
Sure. I'm happy to give anyone
my autograph

16:58.300 --> 17:01.200
anytime or anywhere:
On the street, in a store

17:01.200 --> 17:02.900
or on my private property,

17:02.900 --> 17:04.700
but why be happy
with just an autograph?

17:04.700 --> 17:06.800
What about an original sketch
or snippet of my hair?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.200
And don't forget
to pull my beard.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.400
They say it's good luck.
Look-- there they are!

17:11.400 --> 17:13.900
They're going into
multi-purpose room B.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.300
That room has a dry erase board.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.099
They could be doing
anything in there.

17:18.099 --> 17:22.099
Anything.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.700
Edna, the klingons have
a romantic saying:

17:28.700 --> 17:31.900
( Speaks klingon
click-clack-style )

17:31.900 --> 17:33.400
all:
Aw...

17:33.400 --> 17:35.400
roughly translated, it means

17:35.400 --> 17:38.200
"I would kill the children
of a thousand planets

17:38.200 --> 17:42.200
just to see you smile."
Aw... that is the most romantic

17:42.800 --> 17:44.400
thing I've ever heard,

17:44.400 --> 17:47.000
which is kind of sad
if you think about it.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.600
( Joints creaking )

17:50.600 --> 17:53.000
edna, I want you
to marry me--

17:53.000 --> 17:55.900
right here and now.

17:55.900 --> 17:59.400
If you marry me, we will
honeymoon in nebulon five,

17:59.400 --> 18:01.600
also known as san diego.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.900
Skinner:
No!

18:03.900 --> 18:06.600
Hands off my fiancee, wide ride!

18:06.600 --> 18:08.200
Why are you dressed
like catwoman?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.200
You... oh, they told me
it was catman!

18:11.200 --> 18:15.200
Now prepare
for some roughhousing.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.200
Oh!
Oh!

18:18.200 --> 18:22.200
( Joints creaking )

18:24.200 --> 18:25.800
( grunting )

18:25.800 --> 18:29.800
d-ohh!

18:31.200 --> 18:31.900
( All gasp )

18:31.900 --> 18:34.300
Should we aid our brother
in his blood feud ?

18:34.300 --> 18:38.200
No. My mom worked really hard
on this costume.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.600
stop it!
Stop it, both of you!

18:41.600 --> 18:43.500
Seymour, it's too late
for you to win me back.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.700
This man worships me.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.400
He actually wants
to be my husband.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.400
The female has made
her decision.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.100
Prepare the feast
of goldfish crackers.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.300
I'm not marrying you either.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.200
There are a million
valid reasons,

18:56.200 --> 18:58.100
but which one did you pick?

18:58.100 --> 19:00.900
We've had a great time together,
but we're too different.

19:00.900 --> 19:02.900
I don't understand.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.800
It's like I'm dc comics,
and you're marvel.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
I understand completely.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.300
I don't think I want
to be tied down to anybody.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.400
Take me to some real men.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.700
Okay, you can watch

19:14.700 --> 19:18.000
my dad and my brothers
beat me up.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.400
Come back home with mama, son.
I'll make you some hot cocoa,

19:21.400 --> 19:23.000
while you sit
in your shame closet

19:23.000 --> 19:24.700
and think about what you did.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.500
Well, at least I went
down like a man.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.100
You look like a malaysian
transsexual.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
Good for you, mrs. K.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.100
Yeah! You don't need
a husband to be happy.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.700
Okay, marge, I hear you.

19:37.700 --> 19:40.000
Now that krabappel's
made her decision,

19:40.000 --> 19:42.700
it's time to whitewash
over our problems.

19:42.700 --> 19:46.500
I'm afraid, this time, a coat
of whitewash won't cover it.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.500
( Gasps )

19:50.700 --> 19:52.700
our marriage is
just an illusion.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.000
He doesn't care
how I feel at all.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.900
He doesn't know how to love.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.800
Marge, the greatest day
of my life

19:58.800 --> 20:00.900
was the day
you and I became one.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.300
Would you marry me again?

20:04.300 --> 20:07.500
Oh, it's very sweet,
but I don't need A...

20:07.500 --> 20:11.500
where's that coming from?

20:13.100 --> 20:17.100
A band in a closet.
Every girl's dream.

20:18.600 --> 20:22.600
And now, padre, if you
would do the honors.

20:22.800 --> 20:26.800
( Harsh klingon noises )

20:33.100 --> 20:33.900
marge:
I do.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.600
Marge, you just agreed to raise
the kids klingon!

20:36.600 --> 20:38.300
Marge:
D-ohh!
