WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.046
‐ Ready.

00:04.046 --> 00:05.255
‐ You have to tell us
how you make

00:05.255 --> 00:06.298
something simple
taste so good.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.758
‐ You should have a show
about food or something.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.801
The camera loves you.
‐ Speaking of.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.179
‐ Daniel, you have no idea.
The press smell blood.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.639
They're gonna start circling.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.515
Fame is hard
on a relationship.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.808
‐ I have a film
starting production next week,

00:16.808 --> 00:18.977
and you'd be perfect for it.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.854
‐ There's another group
of sharks we have to deal with.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.814
My family‐‐they keep asking
to meet you.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.066
‐ Hi, I'm Noa.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.859
Smells delicious.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.194
Would you ever think
of opening a restaurant?

00:27.194 --> 00:29.321
‐ The place next door
would be a great café.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.989
‐ Maybe when Daniel takes over.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.242
I don't want Daniel
to lose sight of who he is.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.576
‐ I care about your son.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.287
‐ I'm gay.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.206
‐ You're too young to know
anything about being gay.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.791
‐ This is who I am.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.042
‐ Family dinner?

00:42.042 --> 00:44.461
You invited her
to family dinner?

00:44.461 --> 00:48.173
‐ Oh!
‐ Find yourself a new manager.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.675
‐ What is it
with this girl and soup?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.556
‐ Hey, are you
gonna see her later?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.227
‐ Is that a special delivery
for Noa?

01:00.227 --> 01:02.020
‐ No,
it's just a regular delivery.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.066
You guys should try
our pastelitos.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.651
They're delicious.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.075
‐ So this is what
rich people Christmas is like.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.660
Yo, I got dibs on these.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.453
‐ Dude, you're calling dibs
on everything.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.331
‐ What is all this stuff?
I was only gone 30 minutes.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.333
Happy being Noa Hamilton's
boyfriend day.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.710
‐ Guys, we can't keep this.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.129
‐ Daniel, they want you
to have this stuff, okay?

01:27.129 --> 01:29.298
You put these on,
get a photo in a magazine,

01:29.298 --> 01:31.383
boom, that's free advertising.

01:31.383 --> 01:34.094
‐ Have Mom and Dad
seen any of this?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.762
‐ Yeah, they have.
‐

01:46.023 --> 01:48.150
‐ Oh!
‐

01:48.150 --> 01:49.443
‐ Oyeme, chica.

01:49.443 --> 01:53.280
‐ Ay, Rafael,
live a little, Papi.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.158
Put on a mask and get rid
of those frown lines.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.286
‐ Okay, I had nothing
to do with this.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.662
‐ There may not be a bill,
Daniel,

02:00.662 --> 02:02.205
but there's always a price.
‐ Yep.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.126
When does it end?

02:06.877 --> 02:09.045
‐

02:09.045 --> 02:10.172
‐

02:11.882 --> 02:13.342
‐ On behalf of Dade Motors,

02:13.342 --> 02:15.135
we'd love to know
what you think of the car.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.261
‐ Okay,
now can I have the sneakers?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.766
‐ Uh, I'm sure Noa would love
to go for a ride.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.018
‐ This is insanity, okay?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
‐ Daniel, grab the keys.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.904
Daniel, just reach your hand
and wrap your finger‐‐

02:33.904 --> 02:35.822
Daniel, take the keys!

02:36.990 --> 02:38.909
‐ So what do you think?

02:38.909 --> 02:41.161
‐ So far, life
in the public eye‐‐

02:41.161 --> 02:42.287
not so bad.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.539
‐

02:55.592 --> 02:58.387
‐

03:01.682 --> 03:03.600
Vanessa, I came to apologize.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.228
‐ I am so over you guys.
‐ Okay, you know what?

03:06.228 --> 03:07.354
‐ Let me get‐‐

03:07.354 --> 03:09.564
‐ That's okay,
but let me explain.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.858
‐ Give me the gift.
‐ No, you gotta let me explain.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.570
‐ Okay.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.823
Explain.
‐ Yeah? Cool.

03:19.199 --> 03:19.991
Look...

03:23.412 --> 03:25.497
I lied to you about being sick

03:25.497 --> 03:28.208
because I wanted
to meet Noa Hamilton.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.960
I don't know.
It's just...

03:29.960 --> 03:32.379
I thought maybe...

03:32.379 --> 03:34.131
she'd help make me famous.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.008
‐ Famous, Mateo?

03:37.008 --> 03:39.845
‐ But then you came in
and you said what you did...

03:41.471 --> 03:44.599
And how we just let Noa
have dinner at our house

03:44.599 --> 03:46.017
like nothing,
like no problem, it hit me.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.021
You were right.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.690
You've done so much for me.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.111
I think you and I
can really be a good team.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.698
And you're so good
at convincing people

03:59.698 --> 04:00.949
to give me a chance,

04:00.949 --> 04:03.827
and I am so,
so not good at that.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.328
‐
Yeah, you're not.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.455
‐ Right?

04:06.455 --> 04:07.831
‐ You're so bad at it
that I'm surprised

04:07.831 --> 04:08.874
people even listen to you.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.375
I mean...
‐ Yes.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.334
‐ It's painful to watch, Mateo.
‐ Okay.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.670
‐ Like, you might have
a disorder.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.130
Like, do you ever hear
yourself talking?

04:15.130 --> 04:16.714
It's like the‐‐
‐ I need you...

04:19.468 --> 04:21.678
To manage me.
I need you.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.524
‐ One lie...

04:34.524 --> 04:36.151
one lie, Mateo,

04:36.151 --> 04:37.110
and I will never speak
to you again.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.111
I'm serious.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.989
‐ Vanessa, thank you.
‐ Don't thank me.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.741
Go write some new material.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.452
We can't dine out

04:45.452 --> 04:46.912
on "Calle Ocho Guy"
forever, right?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.466
‐ Okay.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.680
‐ A café.
‐ No way.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.141
‐ With a business loan,
we can do this.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.520
This is our chance, Papi.
Revenue is up.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.856
Thomas Gold called
your magnificos life changing.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.900
It's time for us to expand.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.110
‐ Do you know how much it would
cost to knock down the wall?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.403
‐ Yes, I do.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.323
‐ Better
expand the kitchen.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
Hire more help?
‐ Do you know?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.786
Hmm?
Because I did the numbers.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.578
They're right there.

05:30.247 --> 05:31.957
We can do this, mi amor.

05:31.957 --> 05:34.876
Think about it, Rafael.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.838
Cooking‐‐real cooking
like you used to do.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.631
‐ Ay, Mari, por favor.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.175
That was another place,
another life.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.343
‐ So?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.804
Let's do it now
in this place, in this life.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.013
‐ I just worry that...

05:50.225 --> 05:52.435
That was a dream
of a younger man.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.073
‐ Come on.
So what do you think?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.534
‐ I think it's been
almost a week.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.286
How long is this cold war
gonna last?

06:09.286 --> 06:11.246
‐ I'm just trying to give her
her space, Rafael.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.539
‐ You give her any more,

06:12.539 --> 06:15.041
she'll be living
in another state, Mari.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.297
‐ I don't know what
to say to her.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.967
I'm scared I'm gonna say
the wrong thing.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.343
‐ You're her mother.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.219
Of course you're gonna say
the wrong thing.

06:28.763 --> 06:32.058
And then you'll say
exactly what she needs to hear.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.530
‐
‐ I liked that.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.073
‐ That was fun, right?
‐ I like that side of you.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.117
‐ That was kind of cool.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.328
‐ Who knew you were
such a speed demon, though?

06:51.328 --> 06:52.621
‐ I've got moves
you haven't seen.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.831
‐ Ugh, get a room.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.082
‐

06:57.083 --> 06:59.085
‐ One I'm not in, please.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.920
‐ Is he always waiting for you?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.215
‐ No, only when he has messes
to clean up.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.344
Like, I don't know,
joyriding in a free car?

07:07.344 --> 07:09.054
Keys, please?
‐ She said it was okay.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.264
‐ Oh, did she?
She should know better.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.100
‐ You're such a buzzkill.
I'll be right back.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.810
Be nice.
‐ I'm always nice.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.814
Here's the deal.
You and Noa are a thing now.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.941
And sure, there are perks,

07:21.941 --> 07:23.985
but the one question
you have to ask yourself

07:23.985 --> 07:25.904
before accepting any of them

07:25.904 --> 07:28.740
is this good for Noa?

07:28.740 --> 07:31.660
So driving around
in a flashy car,

07:31.660 --> 07:33.244
feeding this narrative

07:33.244 --> 07:34.996
that you're
some gold‐digging upstart...

07:34.996 --> 07:37.832
‐ I'm not.
‐ Isn't good for Noa.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.125
‐

07:41.419 --> 07:43.004
‐ So what's up, Lewis?

07:43.004 --> 07:44.881
I know you didn't come
for car keys.

07:44.881 --> 07:48.551
‐ Well, one, tonight's gala.
Your dress is in the closet.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.595
Daniel, your tux will be here
this afternoon.

07:50.595 --> 07:51.971
‐ I have a tux?
‐ Yes.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.932
You're not working the gala
this time, baker boy.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.558
You're attending it with Noa.

07:55.558 --> 07:59.938
Two, KKR&A upped their offer.
Here's the proposal.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.357
‐ Offer for what?
‐ My company.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.733
‐ Megacorporations
are always trying

08:03.733 --> 08:05.902
to buy her out, and she
always says the same thing.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.905
‐ No.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.658
Okay,
so that's two out of three.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.284
Did Birch Branch call back?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.499
‐ Yep.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.086
You two have a meeting
this afternoon.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.462
‐ What are you guys
talking about?

08:24.462 --> 08:27.549
‐ Okay, so, babe,

08:27.549 --> 08:30.677
remember when I said
you were great on camera?

08:30.677 --> 08:33.679
I sent your Piñones video
to a production company

08:33.679 --> 08:34.847
that works
with the Food Channel,

08:34.847 --> 08:36.890
and they want to have
a meeting with you...

08:36.890 --> 08:38.852
about a show.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.311
‐ Wait, you serious?

08:40.311 --> 08:41.855
‐ Is that a good face
or bad face?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.732
‐ No, it's a great face.

08:43.732 --> 08:48.236
I mean...me on TV.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.447
‐ Yeah, baby, you'll be great.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.783
I'm gonna go try on that dress.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.204
‐ Take the meeting.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.915
She's not gonna date
a baker her whole life.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.345
‐ Oh, absolutely.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.597
This is actually one of
the best school districts

09:15.597 --> 09:17.265
in the city.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.349
Here's more info.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.894
Oh, hi!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.562
Welcome.
‐ Hey there.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.022
‐ How can I help you?

09:24.022 --> 09:26.024
‐ Um, well, I'm actually here
to help you.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.735
I‐‐okay, first thing
you should know

09:28.735 --> 09:32.113
is that couple right there...

09:32.113 --> 09:34.199
and that guy right over there‐‐

09:34.199 --> 09:35.700
they're reporters
for gossip rags.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.537
They're spying on you.
‐ What?

09:39.537 --> 09:41.164
Why?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.416
‐ Because you're
Daniel Garcia's ex‐girlfriend,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.878
#TheSoupThrower.
‐ #SoupThrower?

09:46.878 --> 09:49.089
‐ Look, I'm a reporter too,
only unlike them,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.924
I'm not here to catch you
in some big gotcha.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.344
I just‐‐
‐ Listen, just leave, okay?

09:54.344 --> 09:55.595
Hi, welcome.
‐ I‐‐

09:55.595 --> 09:57.931
‐ Um, check out
the new countertops.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.265
Gorgeous.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.103
‐ Yeah, look, I'm sure
you don't want to hear this.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.562
It's probably hard enough
to have to see

10:04.562 --> 10:06.564
Daniel and Noa's face
everywhere you turn,

10:06.564 --> 10:08.691
but you are
part of the story too.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.069
‐ Okay, listen, I don't have
anything to say about them.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.447
So you can leave.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.492
‐ I respect that.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.202
Sooner or later, someone's
gonna want to tell your side

10:19.202 --> 10:20.912
whether you like it or not,
so...

10:20.912 --> 10:22.497
give me a call
if you decide

10:22.497 --> 10:23.665
to have control
over your story.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.127
It's just a business card.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.169
Got it.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.717
And from now on, hey,
just assume anyone you talk to

10:34.717 --> 10:36.386
is just a less scrupulous me.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.862
‐ No, Daniel Garcia
is not working today,

10:53.862 --> 10:54.988
but I'm Rafael.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.322
This is my bakery,

10:56.322 --> 10:57.866
and I'm confident
I can help you

10:57.866 --> 10:59.826
with anything that he‐‐

11:05.456 --> 11:06.749
How many of you are waiting
to buy something

11:06.749 --> 11:08.168
from Daniel Garcia?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.961
‐ Over here, yeah!
Yeah!

11:09.961 --> 11:12.380
‐ Your brother's gonna be
the death of me.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.340
Half the line are customers
just waiting to meet him.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.633
‐ I know, right?

11:15.633 --> 11:18.595
They should meet his cool,
better‐looking brother.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.096
‐ We have another brother?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.766
‐ Low‐hanging fruit.
That's what that was.

11:23.766 --> 11:27.937
‐ Hey, Natalie, how 'bout
you and I go shopping today?

11:27.937 --> 11:30.190
‐ Me?
‐ Yeah.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.817
It's been a while
since we've had girl time.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.861
Come on, let's go spend
some of Papi's money.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.615
‐ But Daniel's off today.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.783
‐ Go, go. Go with your mother.
Mateo and I will handle it.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.620
Please, you two go.
Have a good time.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.165
Spend my money.
‐

11:47.165 --> 11:48.791
‐ Sounds great.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.543
‐ It's gonna be fun.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.253
I'll go get the car.
I'll meet you out front.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.755
‐ Yay.
‐ Bye.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.424
‐ Dad, I got

11:56.424 --> 11:57.842
a recording session
this afternoon.

11:57.842 --> 11:58.843
I told you about it last week.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.220
‐ You're gonna
have to cancel it.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.638
I need you to work the counter

12:01.638 --> 12:03.890
while I finish fixing the leak
in the storage closet.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.851
‐ Great idea, except...

12:06.851 --> 12:09.187
I can't cancel
or else I'll lose the money.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.189
‐ You have to.
Mom and Natalie left.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.359
‐ Call them back.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.568
‐
Mateo.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.903
‐ What?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.238
‐ You know how important it is
for them to‐‐

12:18.238 --> 12:20.949
‐ Go shopping?
‐ To reconnect.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.825
I need you here.
End of story.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.246
‐ So let me see if I get this.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.747
Everybody else gets to do
whatever they want,

12:27.747 --> 12:29.415
and I get stuck here
picking up the slack?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.167
Is that what you're telling me?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.461
Dad, I got a business thing
to go to.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.879
It's important.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.965
‐ I can't work the counter
and fix the leak,

12:36.965 --> 12:38.758
and if I don't fix the leak,

12:38.758 --> 12:41.135
that's a health code violation
that could shut us down.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.137
Everyone in this family needs
to sacrifice

12:43.137 --> 12:44.931
for each other
at some point or another,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.683
and today...

12:46.683 --> 12:49.060
It's your turn.
Period.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.169
‐ Lewis, what are you doing?
Should I be worried?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.297
The only time you decide
to eat healthy

13:17.297 --> 13:19.549
is when you're coming down
with something

13:19.549 --> 13:22.302
or you're dating someone new

13:22.302 --> 13:24.262
and you think
that you need to lose weight,

13:24.262 --> 13:26.556
in which case,
let me tell you, you don't.

13:26.556 --> 13:27.807
You look great.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.767
‐ He's a nutritionist,

13:29.767 --> 13:31.686
and they say kale
makes you horny, so...

13:31.686 --> 13:34.564
‐
‐ We need to talk.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.024
‐ Your serious voice.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.193
‐ I heard from Charles Cooper.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.778
The board wasn't exactly happy

13:40.778 --> 13:43.573
that you turned down the KKR&A
offer without even asking them.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.366
‐ It's my company.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.243
‐ Yes, but you do have
a board of directors

13:47.243 --> 13:48.828
who would like
to be kept in the loop.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.621
‐ Fine, send them the proposal.
‐ Thank you.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.831
‐ Thank you.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.999
‐ Then they can agree with me.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.250
Now I need to go
to this meeting with Daniel.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335
I'm already late.
‐ Noa, really?

13:56.335 --> 13:59.505
You don't need to be there.
Daniel's a big boy.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.134
‐ Noa, hi.
It's Melanie Caan.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.302
Hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.679
‐
Put it on speaker.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.348
‐ Uh, no, not at all.
How are you?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.310
‐ I'm good.
I just got back from Toronto.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.353
I know this
is insanely short notice,

14:14.353 --> 14:16.606
but I'm here
at my place in Miami.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.483
I was hoping we could
get together to discuss

14:18.483 --> 14:22.070
another project,
one without Colin Davis.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.865
‐ Uh, yes, of course.
Anytime.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.786
‐ Any chance you could swing by
my place in, say, an hour?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.663
‐
Say yes.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.664
‐ Uh, hang on one second.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.665
Let me double check.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.000
‐ Oh, my God.
Are you insane?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.168
‐ What about Daniel?

14:37.168 --> 14:39.170
‐ You are going
to see Melanie Caan

14:39.170 --> 14:41.255
because this is your dream.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.259
Daniel would agree.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.722
‐ Melanie Caan!
That's great.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.516
Well, let's reschedule this.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.060
‐ No, no, no, don't be silly.
You don't need me.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.645
Just go in there and wow them.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.107
‐ Noa, I've never done anything
like this before.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.316
‐ It's a general meeting.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.026
They just want a feel
for who you are.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.362
Listen,
you single‐handedly saved

15:04.362 --> 15:06.614
my entire benefit
in Puerto Rico,

15:06.614 --> 15:08.366
and you made it magical.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.993
You have a gift, okay?
Trust me.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.287
I gotta go,
but break a leg, okay?

15:13.287 --> 15:15.790
Bye.
‐ Bye.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.544
‐ Daniel, are we still waiting
on Ms. Hamilton?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.256
‐ Actually, it'll just be me.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.882
‐ Okay then.
This way.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.848
‐ I can tell
you're a serious buyer,

15:31.848 --> 15:32.723
so I won't
beat around the bush.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
New kitchen, new floors,

15:34.350 --> 15:36.686
his and her closets
in the master bedroom.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.729
‐ I like it.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.399
But I was really looking
for his and his closets,

15:41.399 --> 15:43.151
not that I want
to go back in the closet.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.278
‐ His and his, of course.
That's exactly what I meant.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.322
So do you want
to make an offer?

15:48.322 --> 15:50.283
‐ Well, I think I would.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.622
‐ Six, three...

15:56.622 --> 15:57.957
‐ You really don't know
who I am?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.210
‐ Wait, please don't tell me

16:01.210 --> 16:02.545
you're another one
of those reporters.

16:02.545 --> 16:04.589
‐ I'm Noa Hamilton's manager.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.259
‐ Even better.

16:08.259 --> 16:11.053
Yet another person walking
in here and wasting my time.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.722
‐ I'm not here
to waste your time.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.265
I'm here to buy a house,
which will, coincidentally,

16:14.265 --> 16:16.642
give you a nice, big,
fat, juicy commission.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.520
You're asking 400k
for this place, right?

16:19.520 --> 16:20.813
‐ Uh‐huh.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.440
‐ Hmm.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.193
How about 450 cash
and we close today?

16:26.194 --> 16:28.654
Huh?
‐

16:30.323 --> 16:31.782
And in return?

16:31.782 --> 16:34.785
‐ Well, when we sit down
to sign the paperwork,

16:34.785 --> 16:36.329
I just get you to sign an NDA.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.580
‐
Wow.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.956
‐ Look, correct me
if I'm wrong.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.583
You're turning down interviews,
so I'm not asking you

16:40.583 --> 16:42.501
to do anything
that you're not already doing.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.213
I just think you should be
rewarded for your loyalty.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.715
You took a big swing,

16:47.715 --> 16:50.885
and it ended in a botched
proposal that went viral.

16:50.885 --> 16:52.887
That was embarrassing.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.347
And then Noa winds up
with Daniel

16:54.347 --> 16:55.348
after you break up with him.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.142
That sucks too.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.685
So now what?

16:59.685 --> 17:03.481
You can move on with your life
and get something out of this.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.525
You're an industrious woman.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.861
Probably take this seed money,
and, a decade from now,

17:08.861 --> 17:10.695
you run an empire.

17:10.695 --> 17:11.906
‐ Hmm.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.281
‐ Trust me,
you never know

17:13.281 --> 17:16.243
when life's
gonna throw you a curveball.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.371
‐ I'm sorry.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.704
I'm not for sale.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.798
‐

17:30.466 --> 17:32.260
‐ What about this one?

17:32.260 --> 17:34.929
‐ I know you're really excited
about the idea

17:34.929 --> 17:36.097
of throwing me
a quinceañera,

17:36.097 --> 17:38.432
but...I'm already 15.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.810
‐ Ay, nobody's gonna care.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.646
Mama, look at this one.

17:45.648 --> 17:47.775
‐ Our bakery is known
for its meringues,

17:47.775 --> 17:49.777
but does that mean
I have to look like one?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.697
‐ Okay, you're right.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.617
‐ Oh, Mom, look at this one.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.160
‐ Ay, Natalie.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.912
It's your quince, Mama,

17:59.912 --> 18:02.665
not the Cuban version
of "Twilight."

18:02.665 --> 18:04.333
‐ Okay, that's fair.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.926
‐ Ooh.
‐ I love it.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.345
‐ Ay, sí, Mama.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.808
‐ Really, you like it?
‐ Mm‐hmm, yes.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.227
‐ It's not traditional.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.104
‐ I don't care
if it's not traditional.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.648
I only care that it
makes you happy.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.025
And it doesn't make you
look like a vampire.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.737
Wow.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.323
Ay, tu abuela and I,
we had such a fun time

18:35.323 --> 18:37.116
planning my quince.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.368
Turned out to be one
of the best days of my life.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.704
I just want that
for you too, mi amor.

18:41.704 --> 18:42.663
For all of us.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.626
‐ I'd really like that, Mom.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.918
‐ Good.

18:47.918 --> 18:48.919
Now let's see you
in this dress.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.129
Come on, let's try it on.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.717
‐ Well, Daniel,
let me start by saying,

18:54.717 --> 18:56.636
big fans.
‐ Fans.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.055
‐ We love what you shot
in Puerto Rico.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.474
‐ The part where you and Noa
are eating the plantains.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.808
‐ Yes! What are those
called again?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.061
‐ The fried green ones
are called tostones,

19:05.061 --> 19:07.730
but when they're ripe,
Cubans call them maduros.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.148
Puerto Ricans
call them amarillos.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.942
‐ That means yellow.
I did a semester in Barcelona.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.072
‐ So pitch us your idea.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.662
‐ Pitch?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.807
‐ Your vision for a show.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.810
‐ Right, um...

19:55.444 --> 19:57.697
‐ You made it!
‐ Hi.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.032
‐ I'm so sorry
for the last‐minute invite.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.617
That must've sounded crazy.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.828
‐ No, I'm so happy you called.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.747
Hello.
That's a very pretty crown.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.208
Is it your birthday?
Happy birthday.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.421
‐ Seven years old.
‐ So cute.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.672
Never thought I'd have a kid,

20:14.672 --> 20:16.632
but it 's a great excuse
for pizza and cake.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.801
Ah!

20:18.801 --> 20:20.261
‐ The truth is,

20:20.261 --> 20:21.595
food is one of our oldest forms
of communication.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.431
So if you think about it,

20:23.431 --> 20:26.308
there's a whole world
of chefs, cooks, food stands,

20:26.308 --> 20:27.810
all telling unique stories
through the dishes

20:27.810 --> 20:29.145
that they make.

20:29.145 --> 20:30.813
It's a universal language.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.482
‐ A universal language.
‐ I love that.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.234
‐ I swear, the minute
parents hear you're having

20:35.234 --> 20:38.028
a drop‐off party,
they take full advantage.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.322
Katie, do not feed
the dog cake!

20:40.322 --> 20:41.449
Have a slice.

20:41.449 --> 20:42.825
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.037
‐

20:47.037 --> 20:49.248
‐ And I always knew I wanted
to do something

20:49.248 --> 20:52.042
that combines food and culture
because I just love

20:52.042 --> 20:53.669
talking to people,
meeting people.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.920
‐ Clearly‐‐so charming.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.048
‐ Noa really put it all
together in San Juan.

20:58.048 --> 21:00.801
She actually shot that video.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.928
‐ Oh‐‐well, that's why
she's Noa Hamilton.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.264
She has the magic eye.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.519
‐ Hey, what's going on here?
‐ He pushed me.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.021
‐ I know.
I saw that.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.606
Are you okay?
You hurt?

21:13.606 --> 21:15.566
‐ No.
‐ Would you like some water?

21:15.566 --> 21:17.193
‐ No.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.612
‐ Shall we report him
to the tug of war association?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.863
‐ Yeah!

21:22.948 --> 21:26.535
‐ Wow, international superstar
Noa Hamilton

21:26.535 --> 21:27.578
is also
a kid whisperer.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.038
‐

21:29.038 --> 21:31.874
‐ Oh, and if Noa can drop in...
‐ Yes.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.376
‐ As a guest from time to time,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.295
I think we have a hit show
on our hands.

21:36.295 --> 21:41.342
‐ So you want me to adopt
an accent and get a motorcycle.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.219
‐ Don't forget the tattoos.
‐ Yeah.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.054
‐ And make sure
Noa's along for the ride.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.348
‐ I'm in.
‐ Me too.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.309
‐ I'm looking for someone
to play the part

21:50.309 --> 21:53.312
of a young mother, which is why
I invited you here today,

21:53.312 --> 21:55.189
to see how you act
around kids.

21:55.189 --> 21:56.899
‐

21:58.567 --> 22:01.445
This film,
it's a passion project.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.405
I've been trying
to get it made for years,

22:03.405 --> 22:06.158
and I think you'd be perfect
for the lead.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.578
‐ A lead.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.622
‐ We're shooting
the entire thing

22:11.622 --> 22:13.874
on location in Morocco.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.001
It'll be challenging,

22:16.001 --> 22:19.213
but I think it could
show the world

22:19.213 --> 22:21.465
a Noa Hamilton
they've never seen before.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.884
Like what "Monster" did
for Charlize.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.472
‐ Wow.

22:28.472 --> 22:30.558
‐ So, what do you say?

22:30.558 --> 22:32.393
You up for spending
three months

22:32.393 --> 22:33.394
in the middle of nowhere?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.398
‐

22:46.490 --> 22:47.491
‐ Betsi,
you should've been there.

22:47.491 --> 22:48.450
It was surreal.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.369
‐ Tattoos and a motorcycle?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.413
They really don't know you,
do they?

22:52.413 --> 22:54.623
‐ I swear to God,
that's what they said.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.543
‐
Well, you would look good.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.794
‐

22:58.794 --> 23:01.005
Of course,
when I think about it,

23:01.005 --> 23:02.381
I love the idea
of doing a show.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.841
‐ Hmm.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.676
‐ But it's like
they had zero interest

23:05.676 --> 23:06.927
in the real me doing it.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.679
‐ Well, that network
is a business.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.264
They want a Daniel
they can sell,

23:10.264 --> 23:12.016
a Daniel they can market
to the world.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.893
Be yourself, Daniel.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.728
Don't let them change
who you are.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.444
‐ Betsi, I've come here

23:23.444 --> 23:26.196
every day to eat your samosas
since I was a kid.

23:26.196 --> 23:27.698
I have a proposition for you.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.410
So break it down.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.662
These samosas are filled
with spiced potatoes,

23:33.662 --> 23:36.749
onions, coriander, and ginger?
‐ That is right.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.334
‐ Samosas are like
the Indian cousin

23:38.334 --> 23:39.710
of Cuban
papas rellenas.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.628
‐
‐ Right?

23:40.628 --> 23:42.254
‐ How should I know?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.381
Somebody never brings me any
from his family's bakery.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.926
‐ Oh, snap. Okay, I will.
I promise.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.970
I'm sorry.
Listen, folks, do you see this?

23:49.970 --> 23:51.305
Do you see that?

23:51.305 --> 23:53.682
Da Vinci's got nothing
on Betsi.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.267
Look at that.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.354
This is samosa art right here.

23:58.354 --> 23:59.897
They're almost
too beautiful to eat.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.440
Keyword: "almost,"

24:01.440 --> 24:02.524
'cause you know as soon
as we stop filming,

24:02.524 --> 24:04.151
I'm scarfing these down.

24:05.235 --> 24:08.864
‐ Okay, so you sure
this is the one?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.407
Because there are,
like, six quince shops

24:10.407 --> 24:11.742
in Little Havana,
and I'm not scared

24:11.742 --> 24:13.160
of taking a deep dive.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.536
‐
I am.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.121
‐

24:16.121 --> 24:19.208
‐ And I'm sure.
‐ Well, you look beautiful.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.709
‐ Hola.
‐ Hola.

24:20.709 --> 24:24.713
‐ We're gonna take this one.
‐ Oh, wonderful choice.

24:24.713 --> 24:27.549
‐

24:27.549 --> 24:28.592
‐ Gracias.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.594
‐ It's so nice

24:30.594 --> 24:33.555
to see mothers and daughters
preserving tradition.

24:37.726 --> 24:43.190
Last week, a girl came in here
wanting a quinceañera suit.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.865
‐

24:53.867 --> 24:55.536
‐ Tell me something.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.704
Are you Cuban?

24:59.999 --> 25:04.044
You should go back to Cuba
because this is America,

25:04.044 --> 25:05.879
and this is a free country,
and people are allowed

25:05.879 --> 25:07.214
to be who they are,
so if this is the way

25:07.214 --> 25:09.258
you talk about your customers,

25:09.258 --> 25:11.051
we're gonna take
our business elsewhere.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.845
Adiós.

25:12.845 --> 25:13.846
Vámonos.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.225
‐ All right, two cafecitos,
uno pastelito de guayaba,

25:18.225 --> 25:20.102
y dos croquetas
de jamón, right?

25:20.102 --> 25:22.062
All right, seven bucks even.
Thank you.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.480
Oh, thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

25:25.482 --> 25:27.234
‐ Who put this here?
‐

25:27.234 --> 25:29.111
That would be me,
your humble servant.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.405
‐ We sell food.
We don't ask for charity.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.990
‐ Well, I had to figure out
another way to make up

25:32.990 --> 25:34.241
for the 300 bucks I lost

25:34.241 --> 25:35.576
for canceling
the recording session.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.661
‐ You lost $300?

25:41.206 --> 25:42.458
We'll be right with you.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.178
Throwing away money like that.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.262
‐ I lost the money
because you forced me

25:55.262 --> 25:56.430
to stay here and work.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.348
‐ No, no, no, no,
I mean spending that much

25:58.348 --> 26:01.101
just to play around
in some recording studio?

26:02.853 --> 26:05.189
‐ Have you ever believed in me?
‐ Mateo.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.273
‐ No, no, no,
because I'm not playing around.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.151
I'm not throwing money away.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.320
In fact,
I'm investing in myself.

26:13.363 --> 26:15.199
Why do you think I'm
always listening to new mixes

26:15.199 --> 26:16.658
and trying out new lyrics?

26:16.658 --> 26:19.286
I haven't had a date in months

26:19.286 --> 26:20.913
because all the money
that I'm making

26:20.913 --> 26:23.165
goes straight into my music‐‐
promo fliers,

26:23.165 --> 26:25.709
SoundCloud account.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.336
I'm actually getting
some traction too.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.129
I'm making real
industry contacts

26:29.129 --> 26:31.090
through the bar mitzvah gig.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.550
They told me that they wanted
to hear a demo of mine.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.969
So that's why I needed
to book a recording studio.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.387
So it can sound professional

26:37.387 --> 26:40.641
because that
is what musicians do.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.354
You, out of all people...

26:47.356 --> 26:48.732
Don't tell me
I'm playing around.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.902
Because I'm doing
exactly what you did.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.447
I'm building
something of my own,

26:55.447 --> 26:57.825
whether you
take it seriously or not.

27:00.494 --> 27:01.703
‐ Mateo...

27:18.387 --> 27:20.889
‐ I just wanted to say
that was awesome.

27:22.266 --> 27:23.684
I know I surprised you,

27:23.684 --> 27:24.977
and I know you're
still getting used to it,

27:24.977 --> 27:27.896
but it meant a lot to me,

27:27.896 --> 27:29.523
the way you defended me.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.072
Uh, I meant that
as a compliment.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.703
‐ That's how it's gonna be,
Natalie.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.498
You being judged by strangers.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.128
Are you sure that's
what you really want?

27:51.128 --> 27:53.213
‐ No.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.924
But wanting
has nothing to do with it.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.636
I don't get it.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.764
You were so cool
about everything.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.309
You're the best mom.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.854
Why can't you just accept this?

28:08.854 --> 28:12.983
‐ Because I can't protect you
for the rest of your life.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.612
And what am I
if I can't protect you?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.701
You're my baby.
You're my everything.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.124
You think you know this world,
Mamita, but you really don't.

28:50.687 --> 28:53.774
‐ Mateo!
Mateo!

28:53.774 --> 28:56.652
‐ 'Sup?
I locked up out front.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.488
Oh, my gosh, more work.
‐ That's right.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.906
You gotta help me
finish this up

29:00.906 --> 29:02.366
so you can get to using it.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.743
I fixed the leak
in the storage area,

29:04.743 --> 29:07.663
and I realized, maybe what
we need isn't a storage closet.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.144
‐ Have you gone crazy?

29:32.729 --> 29:35.399
‐ I read about soundproofing
on the internet.

29:35.399 --> 29:37.651
I couldn't afford to build you
a fancy recording studio,

29:37.651 --> 29:40.487
but I built you
the next best thing.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.488
Test it.

29:43.573 --> 29:45.033
Can you hear me, Mateo?

29:47.285 --> 29:49.663
‐

29:49.663 --> 29:51.832
This is awesome.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.959
‐ Listen, I know a lot of work
has been falling

29:53.959 --> 29:56.378
on your shoulders lately,
and I'm sorry for that,

29:56.378 --> 29:59.089
and I haven't been
very supportive of your music

29:59.089 --> 30:03.260
.in the past, but I want to be.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.594
We sacrificed,

30:04.594 --> 30:07.139
coming to this country
to achieve our dreams,

30:07.139 --> 30:10.142
but more importantly,

30:10.142 --> 30:12.894
so you kids
could achieve yours.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.604
‐ Thank you, Dad.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.194
‐

30:21.194 --> 30:22.988
‐ You've reached
Daniel Garcia.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.489
I can't come
to the phone right now.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.782
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.828
‐ Hey, Daniel, it's me again.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.413
I know you have
that thing with Noa‐‐

30:31.413 --> 30:34.458
your first official
public appearance as a couple.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.002
So your phone's probably off
right now,

30:37.002 --> 30:38.628
but when you get these,

30:38.628 --> 30:40.005
if you could just
give me a call back?

30:42.507 --> 30:44.051
‐ Yo.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.013
Vibe check.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.639
How'd it go today with Mom?

30:49.639 --> 30:51.725
‐ It was fine.

30:51.725 --> 30:54.394
‐ It was fine?
I don't like that word.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.065
‐ You seem to like it
when you're describing women.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.276
‐ Only Maggie Smith.
What happened?

31:01.276 --> 31:04.529
‐ For a minute,
I thought we were past it.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.823
Then she started telling me how
terrible my life was gonna be.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.995
The worst part is
I know she believes that.

31:14.164 --> 31:17.751
‐

31:17.751 --> 31:20.003
She'll get there.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.090
They do.
I mean, think about Dad.

31:23.090 --> 31:26.176
How many years did he think
that my music was a joke?

31:26.176 --> 31:29.638
‐ All of 'em.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.099
‐ Well, today he built me
a recording studio.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.892
‐ What?
‐ Yeah.

31:33.892 --> 31:38.063
‐ We had this,
like, big blowout,

31:38.063 --> 31:41.316
and I finally felt
like he heard me.

31:44.069 --> 31:47.697
So he made the storage closet
into a DIY studio.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.699
‐ He did?
‐ Pretty cool, right?

31:53.870 --> 31:57.624
Point I'm trying to make
is he got there.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.126
She will too.

32:02.212 --> 32:05.173
‐ So Dad built you a closet

32:05.173 --> 32:06.842
and Mom shoved me
back into mine.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.221
‐ Hey.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.273
‐ Get your shoes off my bed.
‐ Yeah.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.244
‐ I'm sorry
that the Food Channel people

32:34.244 --> 32:36.830
turned out to be such idiots.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.331
‐ Maybe they're right.

32:38.331 --> 32:41.084
If I wanna be on TV, I need
a little more showbiz.

32:41.084 --> 32:43.920
‐ Daniel Garcia, no.
‐ What?

32:43.920 --> 32:46.339
‐ Please don't change on me.
‐ I'm not.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.466
‐ You don't have to worry.
‐ Okay, good.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.011
'Cause I like you
just the way you are.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.307
‐ Ugh, straight people.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.434
‐ Gucci, your timing sucks.

32:57.434 --> 32:58.685
‐ No argument from me.

32:58.685 --> 32:59.936
I am counting the days

32:59.936 --> 33:01.354
for your honeymoon phase
to be over.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.775
Your car's downstairs.
This arrived for you.

33:05.775 --> 33:07.569
It's the new proposal
from KKR&A.

33:07.569 --> 33:08.570
Whatever's living in there,

33:08.570 --> 33:09.988
we don't have
the food to feed it.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.240
‐ Okay, now they're
just being aggressive.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.033
‐ Right?

33:15.368 --> 33:16.995
‐ All right, we can send
that to the board.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.247
‐ Good.
‐ With my no.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.208
Can you please help me try on
some earrings?

33:22.959 --> 33:26.213
‐ You know what I'm gonna say.
These, yes, always these.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.672
But they're not as low.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.138
‐ Lewis.

33:35.138 --> 33:38.433
Did you go see Vanessa?
‐ Nuts.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.602
‐ Did you try to bribe her?

33:40.602 --> 33:42.103
‐ I heard people

33:42.103 --> 33:43.647
were after her story,
so I went to talk to her.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.232
It's my job.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.025
‐ Do you understand
how insulting that is

33:47.025 --> 33:48.902
to a woman like Vanessa?

33:48.902 --> 33:51.321
It's already bad enough
that I broke her heart.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.490
Now she thinks I'm trying
to buy her off.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.450
‐ Welcome to reality,
baker boy!

33:55.450 --> 33:57.953
Whether you like it or not,
anyone you hurt,

33:57.953 --> 34:00.413
anyone with a grudge
against you is now my problem,

34:00.413 --> 34:02.040
as if I needed
any more problems right now,

34:02.040 --> 34:03.500
thank you very little.
‐ Lewis.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.459
‐

34:08.838 --> 34:10.547
‐ Are you okay with this?

34:10.547 --> 34:13.092
‐ I'm just hearing about this
for the first time, okay?

34:13.092 --> 34:15.804
‐ Well, okay.
What do you think?

34:15.804 --> 34:18.598
‐ I think I don't like
being put on the spot,

34:18.598 --> 34:21.851
and I think I don't like
your look of judgment.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.311
You broke up with her.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.063
I'm just the one
they're gonna come after.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.815
What do you think about that?

34:32.404 --> 34:33.655
‐ I'll see you in the car.

34:36.533 --> 34:37.951
‐ Wow.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.257
‐ So you didn't find a dress.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.467
‐ Mm‐mm.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.052
‐ But did you talk?

34:58.221 --> 35:00.765
‐ We talked.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.350
‐ And?

35:05.687 --> 35:07.022
‐ And this is not easy.

35:09.941 --> 35:13.945
But...we'll get through it.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.780
We always do.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.743
How was your day?

35:19.743 --> 35:22.370
‐ Interesting.

35:22.370 --> 35:25.290
You know, with Daniel off
with you‐know‐who...

35:25.290 --> 35:26.958
‐ Mm‐hmm.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.752
‐ Natalie discovering
who she is,

35:28.752 --> 35:32.172
and Mateo finally growing up...

35:32.172 --> 35:34.716
‐

35:34.716 --> 35:38.345
I realized life
is always changing.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.305
That's how we know we're alive.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.859
I called the bank.
‐ You did?

35:52.859 --> 35:55.528
‐ You're right.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.073
Twenty years, we've been
working just to make ends meet.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.493
This is our chance...

36:01.493 --> 36:04.037
but I only have one condition.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.914
‐ What?

36:05.914 --> 36:08.249
‐ We call the café...

36:08.249 --> 36:09.417
Mari's.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.420
‐
‐

36:14.589 --> 36:17.092
Gracias‐‐I'm so happy
you said that

36:17.092 --> 36:19.135
because that was gonna be
one of my conditions too.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.845
‐ Oh, really?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

36:20.845 --> 36:21.846
‐ Mm‐hmm?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.556
‐
‐ I love you.

36:23.556 --> 36:26.976
Gracias, Papi.
‐ All right, I love you, Mari.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.066
‐ I don't wanna fight.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.569
‐ I don't want to either.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.280
‐
I can't.

36:39.280 --> 36:40.824
‐ Look, your world
is just gonna take

36:40.824 --> 36:42.826
a little getting used to.

36:42.826 --> 36:43.868
‐ Okay.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.373
And I was really thrown
by how you defended Vanessa.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.626
And then how you looked at us.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.628
Like Lewis and I
were horrible people.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.880
‐ I don't think that.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.882
But you have to understand,

36:57.882 --> 37:00.009
we talk about
how I have to adjust.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.138
Maybe you do too.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.349
But in my family,
we're there for each other.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.268
We argue,
we get mad at each other,

37:08.268 --> 37:10.270
but we talk it out
just like how we're doing

37:10.270 --> 37:11.855
so nothing festers.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.151
‐ I like that.

37:18.361 --> 37:22.073
I'm not used to that, you know?
I always have to be so careful.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.412
‐ We are a team now.

37:27.412 --> 37:32.917
Whatever we face,
we face together.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.379
All right?
‐ All right.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.797
‐

37:37.797 --> 37:39.758
‐ Okay,
so if that's the case...

37:42.469 --> 37:44.304
Have you ever wanted
to go to Morocco?

37:44.304 --> 37:46.181
‐ That's such a random thought.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.350
‐ Well, it isn't
because Melanie Caan

37:49.350 --> 37:52.145
offered me the lead role
in her new film.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.022
‐ What?
That's amazing.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.940
‐ I know.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.610
It shoots in Morocco
for three months,

37:58.610 --> 38:00.653
and I really want you
to come with me.

38:03.740 --> 38:08.536
‐ Wow, three months in Morocco.
I have a job.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.413
My family's here.
I can't just leave.

38:10.413 --> 38:14.667
‐ I mean, why not?
It's just three months.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.211
Think about the food,

38:16.211 --> 38:18.046
all the videos
you could make there.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.173
Really, there's no reason
why we both can't go.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.844
I'm only asking you 'cause I
think what we have is special.

38:33.353 --> 38:34.771
Just think about it.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.130
‐ Come on, it'd be
both our dreams come true.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.184
‐ Need some help?

39:14.602 --> 39:15.854
‐ No, thank you.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.605
‐ Look, Vanessa, I really think

39:17.605 --> 39:19.899
you should reconsider
telling your story.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.484
I would understand
the high road

39:21.484 --> 39:24.445
if Noa met Daniel
after the proposal,

39:24.445 --> 39:26.489
but she met him before.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.452
‐ What?

39:33.329 --> 39:34.539
‐ Oh.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.083
Noa Hamilton
spoke with Daniel.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.295
She flirted with him
right before you proposed.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.340
‐ No, that's impossible.
