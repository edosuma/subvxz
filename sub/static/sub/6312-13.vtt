WEBVTT

00:06.570 --> 00:08.561
(electric bass guitar
playing loudly)

00:10.810 --> 00:12.004
(silverware clinking)

00:14.810 --> 00:17.472
Sherlock, they're at it again!

00:18.710 --> 00:20.712
(electric bass guitar
continues playing)

00:24.320 --> 00:25.685
Hey.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.449
Hey, can you hear me?

00:27.490 --> 00:29.355
(shouts):
You can remove my headphones!

00:31.730 --> 00:33.823
The people next door
are at it again.

00:33.860 --> 00:35.794
Again?
I wasn't aware they stopped.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.593
This is the third night
in a row.
I know.

00:37.630 --> 00:40.667
I also know that you spend
far too much time in slumber.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.759
If you want my advice,
you should take advantage

00:42.810 --> 00:44.801
of this disturbance,
forgo sleep,

00:44.840 --> 00:46.671
and find an activity
which tests your abilities.

00:46.710 --> 00:49.508
Escaping elaborate restraints,
for example.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.178
If that doesn't bother you, then
why did you choose an activity

00:52.220 --> 00:54.438
_ that_included
n0|se-cance||ng headphones?

00:54.480 --> 00:55.811
I didn't say I was
impervious to the noise,

00:55.850 --> 00:57.545
I merely said
I was using it as an impetus.

00:57.590 --> 01:01.117
In any case, our rhythm-obsessed
neighbor should be done soon.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.685
He's been trying to master
a particular riff,

01:03.730 --> 01:06.619
and I think that last attempt
was successful.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.190
(electric bass guitar stops)

01:09.230 --> 01:10.697
Yeah.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.130
You can safely resume
your nightly rituals.

01:20.210 --> 01:21.734
Could...

01:21.780 --> 01:23.771
No, that's not...

01:24.710 --> 01:26.348
*

01:26.380 --> 01:29.713
MAN: Nature provides us
with so many wonders.

01:29.750 --> 01:33.584
But for me,
this is her greatest gift.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.123
Psilocybin.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.128
A naturally-occurring compound

01:38.160 --> 01:41.550
found in simple mushrooms,
which can open our minds

01:41.600 --> 01:44.694
to the realm of spirit,
allowing us

01:44.730 --> 01:47.392
to touch the eternal.

01:47.440 --> 01:51.308
Unfortunately, the mushrooms
themselves taste like crap.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.305
and any nausea or discomfort
that you feel--

01:55.340 --> 01:57.774
that's part of the
experience, too.

01:57.810 --> 02:01.519
I'll be with you
every step of the way.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.485
To the journey.

02:12.730 --> 02:14.755
The effects usually take
about 30 minutes.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.563
The first thing
you will probably notice...

02:16.600 --> 02:17.760
(muffled gunfire,
shouting over TV)

02:17.800 --> 02:20.792
That is not _
part of your experience.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.308
That is my oaf
of a neighbor.

02:23.340 --> 02:26.309
I will take care of that.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.331
(gunfire over TV stops)

02:30.880 --> 02:32.848
Chad, might I ask you
to, uh,

02:32.880 --> 02:35.519
don headphones
while you play your video games?

02:35.550 --> 02:37.245
I'm hosting an experience.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.814
Sure.

02:38.850 --> 02:41.250
As long as you save
a little magic tea for me.

02:41.290 --> 02:43.349
Uh, I'll bring you
a to-go cup in the morning

02:43.390 --> 02:45.529
if there are
no further disruptions.

02:49.230 --> 02:52.791
As I said, the universe
rarely allows enlightenment

02:52.840 --> 02:57.265
without (chuckles) throwing up
a challenge or two.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.839
(gagging)

03:01.880 --> 03:04.747
Oh, no.
(grunts) No!

03:12.460 --> 03:13.711
(grunts)

03:13.760 --> 03:15.489
(line ringing)

03:15.520 --> 03:17.829
OPERATOR:
911. Where's the emergency?

03:17.860 --> 03:20.920
Hello? Is anyone there?

03:20.960 --> 03:22.962
*

03:26.970 --> 03:30.804
DETECTIVE: Uh, looks like
a drug party gone wrong.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.731
That's Joseph Ballantine,
botany professor at QBU.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.771
Neighbor says he throws
these mushroom parties

03:36.810 --> 03:38.471
a couple times a year.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.319
Some party.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.841
Yeah, I figure he picked the
wrong 'shrooms this time around,

03:42.890 --> 03:44.380
poisoned himself
and his customers.

03:44.420 --> 03:45.785
HOLMES:
Uh, wrong.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.651
(clears throat)

03:47.690 --> 03:50.750
That's some consultant
from Major Cases.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.451
He just showed up.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.491
Said he heard about it
on his scanner.

03:54.530 --> 03:56.919
You made him
Sit In a corner?

03:56.970 --> 03:59.393
No, he did that himself.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.839
I was asked not to disturb
any evrdence.

04:00.870 --> 04:03.407
I thought I might also
avert my gaze.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.408
Your detective believes
this to be a mistake

04:05.440 --> 04:07.908
on Ballantine's part,
but the professor

04:07.940 --> 04:09.874
was an authority
on psychedelic mushrooms.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.470
He wrote several excellent books
on the subject.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.409
And despite
his idiotic mysticism,

04:15.450 --> 04:17.441
he was a peerless mycologist
who would never mistake

04:17.490 --> 04:18.718
poisonous mushrooms
for psychedelic ones.

04:18.750 --> 04:19.751
(phone beeps)

04:21.760 --> 04:24.581
Tommy Gregson asked us
to give you five minutes.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.621
You've got two.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.961
As I thought.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.934
The mushrooms the professor
has in his tea

04:35.970 --> 04:39.508
are pure psilocybe azurescens,
also known as Blue Angels.

04:39.540 --> 04:42.543
They are a potent
and relatively rare species

04:42.580 --> 04:44.309
native to
the Columbia River Delta.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.942
There's not a toadstool
In the pot.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.517
And you can tell that
just by looking?

04:48.550 --> 04:50.484
Identifying fungi
is one of a host of skills

04:50.520 --> 04:51.817
a good detective
should have.

04:54.590 --> 04:56.626
These people died quickly.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.582
Note the lack of smearing
in the various effluvia.

04:58.630 --> 05:01.349
No one tried to stagger for help

05:01.400 --> 05:02.822
or to crawl for the door.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.462
They died where they fell,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.730
meaning they were exposed
to a highly concentrated poison.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.431
They were murdered.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.631
Somebody put something
in their drinks.

05:10.670 --> 05:11.830
More likely,
someone put something

05:11.870 --> 05:13.531
in the professor's mushrooms.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.401
IfI had to guess, I'd say
extract of amanita phalloides,

05:16.450 --> 05:17.849
the aptly-named
death cap mushroom.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.541
That would make him

05:19.580 --> 05:21.013
the likely target
and the students

05:21.050 --> 05:22.915
collateral damage.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.111
Fortunately, I've already got
a motive and suspect in mind,

05:25.150 --> 05:28.517
so... it was a pleasure
meeting the both of you.

05:38.900 --> 05:39.889
(doorbell buzzes)

05:44.910 --> 05:46.571
I'm sorry.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.635
Did I wake you?
You must be exhausted.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.545
You were up till what,
5:00 in the morning

05:50.580 --> 05:51.774
playing bass?

05:51.810 --> 05:53.641
You live next door.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.875
I do.
Sorry.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.888
Our landlord told us
the walls were thick

05:57.920 --> 05:59.911
and we _could make
as much norse as we liked.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.655
Yeah, well, I can
hear everything, okay?

06:01.690 --> 06:03.021
That party you had
three weeks ago--

06:03.060 --> 06:04.527
those little kids you had

06:04.560 --> 06:05.982
screaming at each other
for six hours...

06:06.030 --> 06:08.419
(chuckles)
Yeah, that wasn't us.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.688
I heard you.

06:09.730 --> 06:13.063
Uh, no.
Someone else threw that party.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.136
And someone else
had the kids over.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.400
We've only been
here five days.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.702
Five days?

06:18.740 --> 06:20.571
Yeah. Uh, we're just in town

06:20.610 --> 06:22.749
to meet agents
and music executives.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.668
We'll be gone by
the end of the week.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.143
So you're not the new tenants?

06:26.180 --> 06:27.647
No.

06:27.680 --> 06:28.977
Are you guests?

06:29.020 --> 06:31.580
You know this place
is an AwayKay, right?

06:31.620 --> 06:33.986
I-I don't know what that is.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.989
It's like, um,
vacation rental.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.679
Our drummer
found It onIIne.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.721
AwayKay.com.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.092
"Party pads for party people."

06:43.130 --> 06:45.690
I'm sorry about
the noise.

06:45.730 --> 06:49.609
But... I think you're gonna
have to get used to it.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.605
HARPER:
The fight or flight response

06:52.640 --> 06:54.198
starts in the hypothalamus,
which activates

06:54.240 --> 06:56.708
the adrenal gland
in two different ways.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.741
Chemically,
via the pituitary gland,

06:58.780 --> 07:01.442
and with a nerve impulse
via the spinal cord.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.712
This triggers the adrenal gland,
the release of adrenaline,

07:05.750 --> 07:09.459
and that's when things
really kick into high gear.

07:09.490 --> 07:11.629
We will pick up with that
next week.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.651
Remember to read chapter five.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.691
Thank you.
(students murmuring)

07:22.740 --> 07:24.935
Can I help
you gentlemen?

07:24.970 --> 07:26.699
What about cortisol?

07:26.740 --> 07:28.708
The adrenal gland
releases two hormones--

07:28.740 --> 07:31.709
epinephrine, aka adrenaline,
but also cortisol,

07:31.750 --> 07:33.047
and both of those
hormones are crUCIal

07:33.080 --> 07:34.638
to the fight or
flight response.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.739
I was just
teasing the next lesson.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.008
And adrenaline is sexier
than cortisol.

07:39.050 --> 07:41.018
Are you with
the accreditation review?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.221
_Because I wasn't
expecting you until next week.

07:43.260 --> 07:44.989
We're with the NYPD.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.793
We're here to ask
a few questions

07:46.830 --> 07:49.048
about the murder of
Joseph Ballantine.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.069
HARPER:
I always knew Joe's research

07:52.100 --> 07:54.068
might get him into trouble.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.692
But murdered?

07:55.740 --> 07:58.061
Preliminary tests indicate

07:58.110 --> 08:00.670
that the mushrooms he used
were infused with poison

08:00.710 --> 08:01.836
from another mushroom.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.199
The two of you wrote

08:03.250 --> 08:05.673
three books together:
two explorations

08:05.710 --> 08:07.211
on the biochemical
effects of psilocybin

08:07.250 --> 08:09.639
and one textbook on
the chemistry of psychedelics.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.488
Then you two had a falling out.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.084
I wouldn't call it that.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.724
Two years ago,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.648
you published an article
in the Northeastern Journal

08:18.690 --> 08:20.851
of Psychobiology
repudiating his work.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.299
You called his stance
on the benefits

08:22.330 --> 08:25.663
of psychedelic mushrooms
"dangerous pseudoscience."

08:25.700 --> 08:27.236
It was an evisceration;
and it was

08:27.270 --> 08:28.794
a complete reversal
of the position

08:28.840 --> 08:31.707
that the two of you took
in the books you wrote together.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.799
Those books?
Not available anymore.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.307
Pulled from the market.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.077
And that would've cost you
tens of thousands of dollars

08:39.110 --> 08:40.270
in royalties, right?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.140
Look”.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.159
you're right that Joe and I
went our separate ways.

08:47.190 --> 08:48.885
But that was my choice.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.888
Joe invited me

08:50.930 --> 08:52.329
to work on those books with him.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.851
He wanted an expert
in brain chemistry.

08:54.900 --> 08:58.097
Part of the deal was that
I take mushrooms myself.

08:58.130 --> 09:00.098
He wanted me to have
first-hand experience.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.802
But?
I didn't like

09:02.840 --> 09:06.230
what the psilocybin
and other drugs did to me.

09:06.270 --> 09:08.602
I did stupid things
when I was using.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.699
I needed a
clean break.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.876
Pulling the books was my idea.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.343
I didn't want my name
on anything

09:13.380 --> 09:14.916
that endorsed Joe's theories.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.110
How did he take that?

09:16.150 --> 09:17.947
He was fine.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.754
And he didn't care when I ripped
him in the scientific press.

09:20.790 --> 09:24.021
It fit with his image as a rebel
fighting the establishment.

09:24.060 --> 09:25.755
So there were no hard feelings?

09:25.790 --> 09:28.657
Joe and I were in the
same department here.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.294
We ran into each
other all the time.

09:31.330 --> 09:33.969
Ask anyone--
there was never any trouble.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.991
We made our peace.

09:38.910 --> 09:40.901
WATSON:
So what did I miss?

09:40.940 --> 09:43.647
Professor Harper,
it seems,

09:43.680 --> 09:47.070
did not have motive to kill
Professor Ballantine after all.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.940
Oh, so you were wrong.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.039
While Marcus confirms
Harper's story,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.853
I've been casting
about for clues

09:52.890 --> 09:54.380
as to who else might have
wanted Ballantine dead,

09:54.420 --> 09:57.685
and, failing that,
where he acquired

09:57.730 --> 10:00.051
his lethal mushrooms.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.056
Would you care
to join me?

10:02.100 --> 10:04.318
I mean, if you're sufficiently
rested, of course.

10:04.370 --> 10:07.339
I wasn't sleeping in,
I was meeting our new neighbors.

10:07.370 --> 10:09.804
Did you intimidate them
into silence?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.637
I did.

10:11.670 --> 10:15.003
But it doesn't matter;
they're short-term renters.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.179
New people are
coming in on Sunday.

10:17.210 --> 10:20.816
The building is advertised
on a Web site called AwayKay.

10:20.850 --> 10:22.147
They cater to people looking for

10:22.180 --> 10:23.841
party pads
in trendy neighborhoods.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.018
They have five or six locations
within a few blocks of us.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.948
Another unfortunate sign
of gentrification.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.083
Perhaps we should
encourage our local muggers

10:31.130 --> 10:33.428
to increase their activity.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.291
We are not the only
ones with a problem.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.991
I checked the
neighborhood Web site,

10:37.030 --> 10:38.998
_ and_ it is filled_
With n0ise complaints

10:39.030 --> 10:40.861
about the AwayKays.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.107
And local hotels
are losmg busmess.

10:43.140 --> 10:45.358
I'm gonna talk to the owner
next door tomorrow

10:45.410 --> 10:48.038
and let him know
we are not happy.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.446
There's a safe inside the sofa?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.448
Yeah. One that relies
on concealment

10:57.490 --> 10:59.287
rather than a sophisticated
locking mechanism,

10:59.320 --> 11:01.117
fortunately.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.923
Should be simple enough.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.781
(dial clicking)

11:06.830 --> 11:08.821
There.

11:13.940 --> 11:16.135
Professor Ballantine's stash.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.273
WATSON: Three bags
of dried mushrooms.

11:22.310 --> 11:23.470
These are poor quality

11:23.510 --> 11:24.602
psilocybe cubensis.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.313
This is not what was used
in his ill-fated ceremony.

11:28.350 --> 11:31.148
But these are
Blue Angels.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.751
This is the exact same
strain I found in his tea.

11:34.790 --> 11:37.759
"Looking forward
to your thoughts. Danke.

11:37.790 --> 11:40.759
C.K."

11:40.800 --> 11:43.769
I saw a manuscript
that Ballantine was proofing

11:43.800 --> 11:45.791
about lichen.

11:48.440 --> 11:52.979
It was written by someone
named Charlotte Konig.

11:56.310 --> 11:59.040
C.K.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.044
(rock music playing faintly)

12:06.090 --> 12:09.059
If you could just wait here,
sir, and keep the meter running.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.955
Thanks.

12:10.990 --> 12:12.890
According to
university records,

12:12.930 --> 12:15.091
Charlotte Konig
is a German-born biochemist

12:15.130 --> 12:17.360
and Ballantine's
former teaching a55istant.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.937
Here's a photograph of her
in her student days.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.369
She's the one with the tattoos.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.801
The lights are on. I hear music.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.037
(doorbell rings)

12:29.080 --> 12:30.069
(knocking)

12:30.110 --> 12:31.873
WATSON: Hey, maybe
we should wait

12:31.910 --> 12:33.343
till Marcus gets here.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.940
I mean, Charlotte gave
Ballantine those mushrooms.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.516
She could be a murderer.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.518
Even if she is,
she's a poisoner.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.020
Just don't eat or drink
anything; we should be okay.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.467
(lock clicking)

12:50.500 --> 12:51.990
What are you doing?

12:52.030 --> 12:53.930
I smell mushrooms.

12:53.970 --> 12:56.291
That's really great, but, um,

12:56.340 --> 12:59.309
is it really enough to break and
enter in front of our cabbie?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.308
I smell mushrooms.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.047
He smells mushrooms.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.378
(lock clicking)

13:06.410 --> 13:07.911
(door creaking)

13:07.950 --> 13:08.917
(rock music playing loudly)

13:08.950 --> 13:12.215
* And... crazy

13:12.250 --> 13:15.856
* And you think I'm putting on
some kind of act *

13:15.890 --> 13:18.984
* But this is
me, me, me, me, me *

13:19.030 --> 13:22.989
* And you know what's sick?

13:23.030 --> 13:26.397
* I kinda like it

13:26.430 --> 13:28.364
* That nobody I know...

13:28.400 --> 13:31.233
Told you
I smelled mushrooms.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.279
HOLMES: Toxicology confirms
she died from death cap poison.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.584
Someone sprayed
her entire crop with the stuff.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.885
These were growing on her?

13:47.920 --> 13:49.148
WATSON: We think,
as she was dying,

13:49.190 --> 13:50.987
she knocked over a jar
of mature mushrooms.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.521
They spored, and the spores
landed on her body.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.222
HOLMES:
We now think that she was

13:56.260 --> 13:58.967
the intended target of the
poisoner, not Joseph Ballantine.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.230
As you can tell
from these photographs,

14:01.270 --> 14:04.068
her crop was too small for her
to be a dealer-- she grew

14:04.110 --> 14:06.328
just enough for her own use and
occasional gifts for friends.

14:06.370 --> 14:08.406
Seems unlikely the
person who did it

14:08.440 --> 14:09.907
would've known she
would share her crop

14:09.950 --> 14:11.178
with Ballantine.

14:11.210 --> 14:12.916
Also, there was
psilocybin residue

14:12.950 --> 14:14.178
in her tea kettle and cups,

14:14.220 --> 14:16.541
which indicates
she was a regular user.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.411
We figure it must be
someone close to her,

14:18.450 --> 14:20.179
someone who knew
she grew her own mushrooms

14:20.220 --> 14:21.915
and used them regularly.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.985
HOLMES: Or someone
who studied her extensively.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.157
Having said that,
a study of Charlotte

14:26.190 --> 14:27.896
would be no simple endeavor.

14:27.930 --> 14:30.364
She might have been a whiz with
botany and biochemistry, but...

14:30.400 --> 14:32.459
she was not keen on electronics.
WATSON: Yeah.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.094
She didn't use social media.
Didn't even have a cell phone.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.506
What we know so far is
she was born in Germany,

14:37.540 --> 14:40.031
came to the US. for college,
studied under Ballantine,

14:40.080 --> 14:42.901
then had a series of low-paying,
short-term lab jobs

14:42.950 --> 14:45.009
since she got her degree.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.472
Another clue to her personal
life might be her tattoos.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.171
She had a lot
of them.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.939
There's a fresh griffin tattoo
on her shoulder,

14:50.990 --> 14:53.083
an om on her neck,
vines on her forearm,

14:53.120 --> 14:54.951
assorted flowers.

14:55.990 --> 14:59.255
What's that on her back?

14:59.290 --> 15:02.418
Uh, I think there's a
photo in the MLI's report.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.938
"Rache." What is that,
short for Rachel?

15:09.970 --> 15:11.369
HOLMES:
That's possible.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.275
But Charlotte's native language
is German.

15:13.310 --> 15:16.370
And in German, that word is
"rache," which means "revenge."

15:16.410 --> 15:19.208
Maybe it's the name of a band
or something.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.343
Or the ink could speak
for itself and Fraulein Konig

15:21.380 --> 15:23.314
craved revenge.

15:23.350 --> 15:24.612
If she did, you got to wonder

15:24.650 --> 15:27.210
who killed her
to keep her from getting it.

15:27.260 --> 15:31.026
Actually, we may already
have a pretty good idea.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.426
Charlotte Konig
was suing your company

15:33.460 --> 15:36.497
for $100 million, correct?

15:36.530 --> 15:40.489
She claimed we stole her process
for turning algae into biofuel.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.360
Did you?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.537
Of course not.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.435
Zerakem developed
the same process she did

15:45.470 --> 15:48.371
at roughly the same time;
it's coincidence.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.378
That's not how Ms. Konig saw it.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.605
Her lawsuit claims
she published her process

15:52.650 --> 15:55.369
almost six months _
before Zerakem announced theirs.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.183
WATSON:
Your company does not have

15:57.220 --> 15:58.482
the best reputation.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.351
We've heard accusations
that Zerakem engaged

16:00.390 --> 16:03.086
in corporate espionage, as well
as bribing government officials.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.155
HOLMES:
It's not such a great leap

16:05.190 --> 16:08.296
to think that if you saw
Charlotte Konig as an obstacle,

16:08.330 --> 16:10.992
you might have had her removed.

16:11.030 --> 16:13.692
These are denied motions
from Charlotte Konig's lavwers.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.493
We had no reason
to kill her.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.132
We were crushing her in court.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.432
WATSON:
Did Charlotte ever try

16:19.470 --> 16:21.131
to take matters
into her own hands,

16:21.180 --> 16:22.738
threaten you or anyone else
at Zerakem?

16:22.780 --> 16:24.338
I have no
record of that.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.540
But even if
she did try,

16:25.580 --> 16:27.775
we wouldn't have her killed.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.015
We'd get a restraining order.

16:30.050 --> 16:33.019
I have a question of my
own, if that's all right.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.085
You think that Charlotte
and those other people

16:35.120 --> 16:36.519
were killed by death cap poison?

16:38.290 --> 16:40.190
Toxicology proved it.
Before I made VP,

16:40.230 --> 16:42.198
I worked my way up
as a biochemist,

16:42.230 --> 16:45.461
and I know for a fact
there's no way

16:45.500 --> 16:47.365
naturally-occurring
death cap poison

16:47.400 --> 16:48.662
could kill those people
so quickly.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.201
HOLMES:
On that, we agree.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.798
Our current theory
is that the killer

16:51.840 --> 16:54.673
extracted mycotoxin
from a large number of mushrooms

16:54.710 --> 16:58.202
and then concentrated it
to produce a lethal dose.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.378
That is one way to do it,
but it's slow and inefficient.

17:01.420 --> 17:04.480
A better way would be
to synthesize the poison,

17:04.520 --> 17:08.513
build it up from scratch from
biochemical building blocks.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.721
I mean, if it helps,
I could give you a list

17:10.760 --> 17:13.558
of facilities around here
that do that kind of work.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.568
(doorbells jingle)

17:21.600 --> 17:23.431
Welcome.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.109
IfI can help you with
anything, let me know.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.506
Um, actually, I was hoping
I could talk to you

17:28.540 --> 17:30.849
about the building
you turned into an AwayKay.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.610
I remember you.

17:33.650 --> 17:36.448
You're the girlfriend--
Sherlock's.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.449
Yeah, you moved in with him
about a year before I left.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.219
Uh, I'm not his girlfriend.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.421
And I didn't realize
you two knew each other.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.757
We don't.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.224
I introduced myself on
the day he moved in.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.228
Got his name, his e-mail.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.262
That's it.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.632
Are you thinking of turning
your place into an AwayKay?

17:53.670 --> 17:55.092
It's easy.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.539
I can tell you all about it.

17:56.570 --> 17:59.630
We've been having
some problems with noise.

17:59.670 --> 18:01.570
People coming in
at all hours. It...

18:01.610 --> 18:02.702
(chuckles)

18:02.740 --> 18:04.241
Is there something funny?

18:04.280 --> 18:07.317
I'm sorry, it's...

18:07.350 --> 18:08.715
That's rich,

18:08.750 --> 18:11.412
you two
complaining about the noise.

18:11.450 --> 18:12.712
How so?

18:12.750 --> 18:15.480
Because...

18:15.520 --> 18:18.489
you're the reason that I can't
live in my own building.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.555
You're the reason that I
can't keep tenants in there

18:20.600 --> 18:22.488
for more than six
months at a time.

18:22.530 --> 18:25.226
You're not happy that I turned
my place into an AwayKay?

18:25.270 --> 18:26.498
Yeah, too bad.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.498
You brought it
on yourselves.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.804
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.809
I moved out because of you two.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.637
I couldn't take it anymore.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.568
The weird noises,
the strange smells,

18:37.610 --> 18:39.908
the explosions, and the
damn bees on the roof.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.508
Oh, come on, please.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.211
Don't pretend that
this is news to you.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.615
Actually, it is.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.653
Look, you didn't just
list your place on AwayKay.

18:47.690 --> 18:50.227
You went out of your way
to attract problem tenants.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.683
I read the ad. "Parties welcome.
N0ise not an issue."

18:52.730 --> 18:54.550
This is not just about
paying the mortgage.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.819
Every action has an equal
and opposite reaction.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.690
That's physics.

18:59.730 --> 19:00.958
That's crazy.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.537
We could've talked about this
and fixed it a long time ago.

19:03.570 --> 19:06.334
I e-mailed Sherlock
dozens of times.

19:06.370 --> 19:09.498
I practically begged him
to be more considerate.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.939
But it only got worse.

19:10.980 --> 19:14.438
And then the... the roosters--
that was the last straw.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.811
I forgot about the roosters.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.681
Yeah, I did, too.

19:17.720 --> 19:19.347
Eventually.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.654
By moving out.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.250
Those e-mails you sent--
could you show them to me?

19:28.260 --> 19:30.319
I suppose we could
synthesize death cap poison,

19:30.370 --> 19:33.635
but I can't imagine anyone
wanting to kill Charlotte.

19:33.670 --> 19:34.830
You knew her?

19:34.870 --> 19:36.462
She used to work here.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.730
Unﬁlabout
a year ago.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.772
She was sweet, and much
quieter than you'd think.

19:40.810 --> 19:43.699
All those tattoos.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.207
Um, she have any issues
with anyone?

19:46.250 --> 19:48.218
Conflicts over work duties,
sexual harassment,

19:48.250 --> 19:49.649
anything like that?

19:49.680 --> 19:51.841
WOMAN:
No, not that I'm aware of.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.687
Thank you, Doctor,
you've been most helpful.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.687
Excuse me.

19:54.720 --> 19:55.880
Uh, I work with the police.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.524
I was hoping
we might have a chat.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.549
About?

19:58.590 --> 19:59.784
About Charlotte Konig.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.388
And whether
your sleeping together

20:01.430 --> 20:03.398
had anything to do
with her murder.

20:06.770 --> 20:09.739
Nobody knew about us here,
so how did you...?

20:09.770 --> 20:10.737
Your forearm tattoo.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.806
It's almost identical

20:12.840 --> 20:14.728
to the one that Charlotte had.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.532
In fact, if you were
to line them up,

20:16.580 --> 20:17.945
those vines would interconnect,
would they not?

20:20.380 --> 20:23.747
So the two of you were lovers.
That's not in any doubt.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.247
What is in question is...

20:26.290 --> 20:28.258
We were together
for almost a year.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.780
I would never have hurt her.

20:29.820 --> 20:31.720
But you're not together anymore.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.729
When we started hanging out,
she was fun.

20:36.760 --> 20:41.766
She liked to take mushrooms,
drop acid, do Molly.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.665
Chemists--
we get the best stuff,

20:43.710 --> 20:46.031
'cause we make it ourselves.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.607
Charlotte was a nonstop party.

20:49.810 --> 20:51.801
Until she wasn't?

20:53.880 --> 20:55.848
About a year ago,

20:55.880 --> 21:00.556
her biological clock
started ticking, loud.

21:00.590 --> 21:04.959
She was talking about
wanting kids, getting married.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.550
BELL:
Which didn't interest you?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.694
Well, how did Charlotte take it
when you broke things off?

21:10.730 --> 21:14.689
Not well, at first,
but then she got over it,

21:14.740 --> 21:16.628
'cause last I heard,
she'd met some guy,

21:16.670 --> 21:18.399
and they were gonna get married.

21:18.440 --> 21:21.534
So, she got what she wanted,
and I did, too.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.808
Win, win.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.842
You know her fianc's name?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.848
(sighs)

21:26.880 --> 21:29.713
I was on something that night.
It's fuzzy.

21:29.750 --> 21:33.914
Do you know the story behind
Charlotte's "rache" tattoo?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.521
I know it meant "revenge."

21:37.560 --> 21:41.052
Aside from that, she didn't
really like to talk about it.

21:42.930 --> 21:44.488
Griffin.

21:44.530 --> 21:45.895
Excuse me?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.761
Just came to me.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.405
New guy's first name-- Griffin.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.431
What about his last name?

21:52.470 --> 21:55.109
I don't think it ever came up.

21:55.140 --> 21:58.576
You remember the newly-inked
tattoo on Charlotte's shoulder?

21:58.610 --> 22:00.771
A griffin.
Mm.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.584
If I'm not mistaken,
it was by the same artist

22:03.620 --> 22:05.315
that did that tattoo.

22:07.490 --> 22:09.515
What was the name
of the tattoo shop?

22:09.560 --> 22:12.620
Any progress?

22:12.660 --> 22:15.026
Incremental, but significant.

22:15.060 --> 22:19.019
I was able to contact
Charlotte's tattoo artist, Aviv,

22:19.070 --> 22:23.029
who told me the tale of
Charlotte and her newest beau,

22:23.070 --> 22:24.662
Griffin.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.405
So they went into
the shop together.

22:26.440 --> 22:27.976
As people are wont to do
when they wish

22:28.010 --> 22:30.501
to immortalize their love
via the tattoo needle.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.006
Never a good idea,
in my opinion.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.439
Life is far too fluid
for such mementos.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.573
Imagine me with a giant
"Moriarty" across my stomach.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.542
It would have said "Irene,"
but I take your point.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.889
Aanay, Charlotte's griffin
went on without a hitch,

22:41.920 --> 22:44.480
but when it was Griffin's turn,
things went awry.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.157
He filled out the release,
but no sooner

22:46.190 --> 22:48.852
had the needle gun started up
than he had a change of heart.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.027
He chickened out.
In his defense,

22:51.070 --> 22:52.469
he invoked his membership with

22:52.500 --> 22:54.468
the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.401
They view tattooing as
a defilement of the body temple.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.567
To Charlotte's dismay,
he left the tattoo shop

22:59.610 --> 23:00.975
uninked, never to return.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.568
But he signed the release.

23:02.610 --> 23:03.872
If Aviv kept it, that means

23:03.910 --> 23:05.946
he has Griffin's full
name and address.

23:05.980 --> 23:08.448
More than a week passed without
him reporting her missing,

23:08.480 --> 23:09.947
and I would like to know why.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.619
Aviv is searching his files and
will get back to us presently.

23:12.650 --> 23:14.550
Good. So we have
some time to talk.

23:14.590 --> 23:15.579
About what?

23:15.620 --> 23:17.485
About the AwayKay
next door

23:17.530 --> 23:19.555
and how the whole
thing is your fault.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.968
Hmm.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.797
Hmm? That's it?

23:27.840 --> 23:30.559
We chased some poor guy
out of his home,

23:30.610 --> 23:32.635
and all you can say is "Hmm."

23:32.670 --> 23:35.605
You do see that _this is not
my current e-mail address.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.834
So?

23:36.880 --> 23:39.474
So, when I first met
Mr. Garby, I was on drugs,

23:39.510 --> 23:41.114
didn't think I'd be
living here for very long.

23:41.150 --> 23:42.913
I had no desire to
make any new friends,

23:42.950 --> 23:44.679
so I gave him
an e-mail address

23:44.720 --> 23:45.982
I hadn't used since
the late '905.

23:47.490 --> 23:48.752
Instead of issuing his
grievances electronically,

23:48.790 --> 23:50.781
he could've just knocked
on our front door.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.923
He was afraid of you.
Did I threaten him?

23:52.960 --> 23:54.757
You don't even remember
if you threatened him.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.597
I was on drugs.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.463
May I point out that by the time
Mr. Garby vacated his premises,

23:59.500 --> 24:01.468
you had been living here
for almost two years.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.535
What, you're trying
to blame this on me?

24:02.570 --> 24:04.208
I'm saying there's plenty
of blame to go around.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.561
You are the one
who makes all the noise.
And you're the one

24:06.610 --> 24:08.669
who never stops me. Why? Because
you know that the work I do

24:08.710 --> 24:10.200
is important. It's for...
Okay, if you say

24:10.240 --> 24:12.208
it's for the greater good,
I am gonna punch you.

24:13.210 --> 24:14.643
You accompanied me once

24:14.680 --> 24:17.012
to my former residence
in London, 2213.

24:17.050 --> 24:19.587
Did I ever tell you about
the people in 221A?

24:19.620 --> 24:22.555
No.
They didn't like having
me for a neighbor, either.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.956
What did you do?
I took care of it.

24:24.990 --> 24:28.118
What do you mean,
you took care of it?
(phone chimes)

24:28.160 --> 24:29.127
(sighs)

24:29.160 --> 24:30.696
It's the tattoo artist.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.699
He's located Griffin's
personal information.

24:33.740 --> 24:36.061
I couldn't have
killed Charlotte.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.636
I loved her.

24:37.670 --> 24:40.230
If you don't mind me saying so,

24:40.270 --> 24:42.875
you seem like a...
you seem like an unlikely match.

24:42.910 --> 24:46.869
I mean, Charlotte had
a checkered past.

24:46.910 --> 24:50.516
And sometimes she fell
back into old habits, but...

24:50.550 --> 24:52.211
I wasn't perfect, either.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.252
We were working
to put all that behind us.

24:54.290 --> 24:56.588
How were you doing that
exactly?

24:56.620 --> 24:59.680
GRIFFIN:
We started going to services
together at the local ward.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.618
She was considering
converting.

25:01.660 --> 25:04.663
We were talking about
getting married, having kids.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.190
Sir, excuse me.
Ijust need to...

25:06.230 --> 25:07.993
bathroom.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.564
(door opens)

25:09.600 --> 25:10.965
I have to ask.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.966
Charlotte has been dead
for over a week.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.739
If you two were
so happy together,

25:14.780 --> 25:16.736
why didn't you
report her missing?

25:16.780 --> 25:17.974
(sighs)

25:18.010 --> 25:19.546
Sometimes she'd slip.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.310
We'd fight.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.716
Usually when that happened,
she'd disappear for a while,

25:24.750 --> 25:26.786
she wouldn't return my calls.

25:26.820 --> 25:28.708
Once, she even went home
to Germany without telling me,

25:28.760 --> 25:32.287
so... I just thought it was
the same thing this time.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.892
And why did you think that?

25:35.930 --> 25:37.795
Did you two have a fight?

25:37.830 --> 25:39.263
(sighs)

25:39.300 --> 25:41.336
She wanted me
to get a tattoo.

25:41.370 --> 25:45.909
Uh... it just felt wrong,
so I said no.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.738
She got upset,
we argued, she left.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.908
I went by her place
a few days later, but, uh...

25:51.950 --> 25:54.009
she didn't answer the door,
so...

25:54.050 --> 25:56.769
I just decided
to give her some space.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.640
And I was sure
she would come back eventually.

25:58.690 --> 25:59.748
She always had before.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.781
What the heck? Hey.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.219
Hey! Hey, he can't
do that! Hey!

26:06.330 --> 26:09.720
Hey, what are you doing?!
That's breaking and entering!

26:09.760 --> 26:12.160
Griffin, you seem like
an exemplary young man,

26:12.200 --> 26:14.031
so perhaps you'd
like to explain to me

26:14.070 --> 26:16.732
why you have a drug lab
in your backyard.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.346
GRIFFIN:
It was Charlotte's idea.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.972
We were both struggling.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.875
We needed to earn
some extra money.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.808
So you began
to manufacture illegal drugs.

26:29.850 --> 26:32.887
Not illegal. Counterfeit.

26:32.920 --> 26:36.048
_ Counterfeit _
erectile dysfunction pills,

26:36.090 --> 26:38.729
to be specific.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.387
What's your local bishop
going to have to say about that?

26:40.430 --> 26:42.352
He's not gonna like it.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.891
But do you know how much the
pharmaceutical companies charge

26:44.930 --> 26:46.090
for just one of those pills?

26:46.130 --> 26:48.132
$40 or $50.

26:48.170 --> 26:49.797
And most insurance
won't cover them.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.239
That's robbery.

26:51.270 --> 26:52.066
So you and Charlotte decided

26:52.110 --> 26:54.101
to strike a blow
against Big Pharma.

26:54.140 --> 26:57.405
We can make pills every bit
as good as the real thing

26:57.440 --> 26:59.146
for under five dollars each.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.272
GREGSON:
Assuming you sold them

27:00.310 --> 27:03.848
to a distributor
for ten, $15 a pill,

27:03.890 --> 27:06.848
you would have
raked in about...

27:06.890 --> 27:08.858
100 grand a batch?

27:08.890 --> 27:10.721
Yet, the both of you
are still renting,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.284
there's no appreciable increase

27:12.330 --> 27:14.127
in your bank accounts?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.697
What little money
that Charlotte made

27:16.730 --> 27:18.698
from her legitimate jobs
was going to the lawyers

27:18.730 --> 27:20.129
handling her Zerakem lawsuit.

27:20.170 --> 27:21.933
And between paying off
your student loans

27:21.970 --> 27:23.198
and your grandmother's
medical bills,

27:23.240 --> 27:25.208
you're barely getting by.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.777
Which raises the question:
where did the money go?

27:27.810 --> 27:29.175
(sighs)
I don't know.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.269
HOLMES:
That's hard to believe.

27:31.310 --> 27:33.915
You're a chemist, as well,
so you have the requisite skills

27:33.950 --> 27:36.145
to create the mycotoxin
that took her life.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.211
I would never do that.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.184
Then explain
where the money went.

27:42.220 --> 27:43.926
I can't.

27:43.960 --> 27:46.758
I don't even know
who we were selling to.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.894
Charlotte handled the
money, she dealt with

27:48.930 --> 27:50.352
the distributor,
all of it.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.958
Whenever I asked,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.763
she said everything was
going according to plan,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.688
and that we would be
set for life.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.695
That's it.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.038
And you believed her?

27:59.070 --> 28:00.799
I did until today.

28:00.840 --> 28:03.968
But maybe she was putting
a happy face on things.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.001
You know, she did that
sometimes.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.345
she pushed, and they killed her.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.052
I mean, I don't know.

28:15.090 --> 28:18.059
That's the only thing
that makes sense to me.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.785
(phone ringing)

28:19.830 --> 28:21.320
Hey.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.328
_BELL:
Hey. So I just got a report

28:23.360 --> 28:24.896
from the forensic accountant.

28:24.930 --> 28:27.069
There's no sign
Griffin's been hiding the money

28:27.100 --> 28:29.034
from those counterfeit
E.D. pills,

28:29.070 --> 28:31.368
and there's no evidence
in his home or his lab

28:31.410 --> 28:32.809
that he's handled
the precursors you'd need

28:32.840 --> 28:34.171
to synthesize
the mushroom poison.

28:34.210 --> 28:35.370
So his story checks out?

28:35.410 --> 28:37.298
Yeah. We're holding him

28:37.340 --> 28:40.377
on the drug charges, but
I don't think he's our killer.

28:40.410 --> 28:43.049
So, I don't suppose you
and Sherlock have had any luck

28:43.080 --> 28:44.217
identifying Charlotte's
distributor?

28:44.250 --> 28:46.241
Well, Sherlock said
he had a plan.

28:46.290 --> 28:49.817
I just took a break to get some
groceries, so I'm almost...

28:49.860 --> 28:52.351
(indistinct police radio
chatter, distant shouting)

28:52.390 --> 28:56.019
Marcus, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.897
Tell me you did not
start that fire.
I did not start that fire.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.362
You said that you were
gonna take care

29:04.410 --> 29:06.002
of the AwayKay problem.

29:06.040 --> 29:07.268
Through folk art.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.277
Specifically,

29:08.310 --> 29:09.902
chain saw sculpting.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.103
One uses a chain saw
to artfully sculpt

29:13.150 --> 29:15.175
_ entire tree trunks
into a bear perhaps

29:15.220 --> 29:16.369
or an eagle.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.388
All rather kitsch
and extremely loud.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.149
I'd retrieved my chain saw
from storage,

29:20.190 --> 29:22.249
and I was in the process
of oiling it

29:22.290 --> 29:23.951
when that fire broke out.

29:23.990 --> 29:26.288
So your alibi is that you were
oiling your chain saw.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.389
Is this how you solved
your problem at 221A?

29:28.430 --> 29:29.795
Folk art?

29:29.830 --> 29:31.422
I bought 221A.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.268
I was quite willing to do the
same in our current situation,

29:34.300 --> 29:36.393
but the chain saw seemed
like a logical first step.

29:36.440 --> 29:40.069
(sighs) Well, I am sorry
that I accused you of arson.

29:42.340 --> 29:44.843
Well, I was
the obvious suspect.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.440
The fire marshal believes
that the fire was

29:47.480 --> 29:51.348
electrical in nature, started
by a faulty amplifier.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.142
An accident.

29:53.190 --> 29:55.988
In other news,
I've placed express orders

29:56.020 --> 29:57.954
for erectile dysfunction
medication

29:57.990 --> 30:00.288
from several dozen
online pharmaCIes.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.821
Given the volume of pills
Charlotte and Griffin

30:02.860 --> 30:04.396
were manufacturing,
it seems like

30:04.430 --> 30:06.398
the most likely route
for distribution.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.295
Note the subtle difference

30:08.340 --> 30:11.207
between the counterfeits
and the real thing.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.208
Charlotte and Griffin's pills
are a little less blue.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.129
Hmm. IfI can find pills
in the same shade,

30:16.180 --> 30:18.000
I might be able to identify

30:18.050 --> 30:21.178
which online pharmacy they were
using to distribute their wares.

30:21.220 --> 30:25.338
Okay. So I inadvertently sold
some counterfeit medicine.

30:25.390 --> 30:28.188
We talking a warning, a fine?

30:28.220 --> 30:30.313
You don't seem
very concerned.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.486
In my line of work,
fines are just

30:31.530 --> 30:32.849
part of the cost
of doing business.

30:32.890 --> 30:34.255
What about murder?

30:34.300 --> 30:36.359
Is that part
of your business model as well?

30:36.400 --> 30:37.549
Who got murdered?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.158
Charlotte Konig.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.565
The woman who
made those pills.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.261
HOLMES:
She was poisoned.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.858
You're a licensed pharmacist,
Mr. Fong.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.639
I assume you know your way
around a biochem lab.

30:45.670 --> 30:47.501
Why would I kill Charlotte?

30:47.540 --> 30:49.428
She made a great product.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.471
So you admit to being
her distributor?

30:52.910 --> 30:55.071
Yeah, fine,
but I didn't kill her.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.519
So where's the money?

30:56.550 --> 30:57.642
What money?

30:57.680 --> 30:59.511
The money
that you should've paid her

30:59.550 --> 31:01.882
for her product-- hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.558
I paid Charlotte
every dime that I owed her.

31:03.590 --> 31:05.319
Ijust did it in real estate.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.421
Look.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.930
She had me buy up a bunch
of rundown properties in Newark,

31:13.970 --> 31:15.392
put them in a trust

31:15.440 --> 31:18.432
where she was a secret
sole benefICIary.

31:18.470 --> 31:21.473
_ Those are all
interest-only loans.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.308
And I pay the interest,
in exchange for more product.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.669
But I don't think she was gonna

31:25.710 --> 31:27.473
hold on to the properties
for long.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.341
I got a feeling
she was working on a deal

31:29.380 --> 31:31.644
to unload them at a profit, but
she never told me the details.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.510
You got a map
of these properties?

31:33.550 --> 31:36.053
Sure.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.379
WATSON:
Those are all near

31:40.430 --> 31:43.456
Zerakem facilities.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.424
I think we've finally found
Charlotte's revenge.

31:48.470 --> 31:51.633
HOLMES: Note the location
of Charlotte's properties here.

31:51.670 --> 31:55.629
All of them bordering
these two Zerakem facilities.

31:55.680 --> 31:57.534
I see.

31:57.580 --> 31:59.673
Now, Zerakem has three
facilities in the area, right?

31:59.710 --> 32:02.019
These two, further inland,
and this main one here

32:02.050 --> 32:04.211
by the Passaic River.

32:04.250 --> 32:07.048
These are separated by a little
over a quarter of a mile.

32:07.090 --> 32:08.057
Correct?

32:08.090 --> 32:09.114
Correct.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.411
Right. Could
you explain

32:10.460 --> 32:13.054
to us why that distance
is important?

32:13.090 --> 32:16.719
For these facilities to be
considered separate entities

32:16.760 --> 32:18.728
by the EPA,
they have to be more than

32:18.770 --> 32:21.091
a quarter of a mile apart.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.335
If they're any closer,
they count as one facility

32:23.370 --> 32:25.565
for_the sake of
pollution regulation.

32:25.610 --> 32:28.431
And one larger facility
is subject to much more

32:28.480 --> 32:31.506
stringent regulation
than three smaller ones.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.438
Mm-hmm.
Now,
according to plans

32:33.480 --> 32:36.517
Zerakem's filed with the city,
they plan to implement

32:36.550 --> 32:39.587
Charlotte's biofuel process
at this plant here.

32:39.620 --> 32:42.589
Algae tanks here,
processing here.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.485
WATSON:
Except there's a problem.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.452
By expanding,
you close the gap

32:46.490 --> 32:48.526
between the facilities,
which will trigger

32:48.560 --> 32:51.290
much more stringent
EPA regulations

32:51.330 --> 32:53.560
that will cost you
millions per year, unless...

32:53.600 --> 32:57.468
We expand these two facilities

32:57.500 --> 32:59.536
further inland.
HOLMES: Mm.

32:59.570 --> 33:01.629
Because the EPA measures
the distance between facilities

33:01.680 --> 33:04.171
not from border to border,
but from center to center.

33:04.210 --> 33:08.214
So if you expand
these facilities like so...

33:08.250 --> 33:10.445
And Zerakem can continue
to pollute at their old levels

33:10.480 --> 33:12.687
without paying fines
or making upgrades.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.450
BELL: Charlotte figured
that out before you did.

33:15.490 --> 33:17.287
She roadblocked you.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.288
She was trying
to gouge Zerakem

33:19.330 --> 33:22.026
into paying her the money
that she believed she was owed

33:22.060 --> 33:25.427
for her biofuel process.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.665
$15 million above market--

33:27.700 --> 33:31.431
that's what the trust that holds
these properties was demanding.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.267
Except now Charlotte is dead.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.278
As far as we can tell,
she has no heirs,

33:35.310 --> 33:36.675
so the banks will foreclose
on her properties,

33:36.710 --> 33:38.541
and Zerakem will be able
to purchase them

33:38.580 --> 33:41.310
at fair market value.
HOLMES: Thus saving millions

33:41.350 --> 33:45.138
and avoiding paying off a gadfly
who's been making you suffer.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.750
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

33:54.160 --> 33:57.550
I have worked my entire
adult life at Zerakem.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.068
_ I've never
believed the rumors

34:00.100 --> 34:03.069
about what the company
is capable of.

34:03.100 --> 34:06.638
I-I've never seen any real
evidence of any wrongdoing.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.228
But if Charlotte Konig

34:08.280 --> 34:10.703
is behind the trust
and now she's dead...

34:13.510 --> 34:15.819
I won't work for a company
that murders people.

34:15.850 --> 34:17.545
What do you need?

34:19.820 --> 34:22.550
You're offering to cooperate?

34:22.590 --> 34:25.582
I'm offering to burn Zerakem
to the ground.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.692
Miss Pal gave
us everything.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.698
Every memo that anyone
at Zerakem ever wrote

34:32.730 --> 34:35.699
about the New Jersey
expansion, every e-mail.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.696
The only way any of
it would be useful

34:37.740 --> 34:40.709
is lining the bottom of
several thousand birdcages.

34:40.740 --> 34:42.708
Oh, you're not
finding anything.

34:42.740 --> 34:44.571
I found a great deal.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.441
All of it indicates that,
in all likelihood,

34:46.480 --> 34:49.210
Zerakem did not kill
Charlotte Konig.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.842
As recently as two days ago,

34:50.880 --> 34:52.848
the senior management were
instructing their lawyers

34:52.890 --> 34:54.551
to attempt to identify

34:54.590 --> 34:56.182
the principals
behind the land trust.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.756
They didn't know
it was Charlotte.

34:57.790 --> 34:58.825
They did not,
and even if they had,

34:58.860 --> 35:00.748
they would not have been able
to profit from it.

35:00.790 --> 35:03.190
The company would have
saved $15 million.

35:03.230 --> 35:04.766
But no one at the company
was in line

35:04.800 --> 35:06.665
for a specific bonus
over the deal.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.498
The $15 million savings
would not have moved

35:09.540 --> 35:11.735
Zerakem's stock price one iota.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.306
And stock options are

35:13.340 --> 35:14.739
the only way the
executives could share

35:14.780 --> 35:16.509
in the corporation's
success.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.747
So while Zerakem itself
has motive,

35:18.780 --> 35:21.214
no human being
at the company does.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.218
So we're back
to the drawing board.

35:23.250 --> 35:24.217
Mm-hmm.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.218
(phone chimes)

35:26.250 --> 35:28.559
(phone clicks)

35:30.420 --> 35:32.229
What is it?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.650
Uh, it's an e-mail
from Trent Garby.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.656
He's saying that
his insurance company

35:37.700 --> 35:39.668
is refusing
to pay out on the fire,

35:39.700 --> 35:43.693
because he was using his
property for short-term rentals.

35:43.740 --> 35:44.866
So it was technically a hotel.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.537
He doesn't have
the right coverage.

35:46.570 --> 35:48.800
That's good. We can
carry out plan B,

35:48.840 --> 35:52.674
aka plan 221A: buy the
place, now at a discount.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.712
I would say
that you're a callous jerk,

35:54.750 --> 35:57.344
but that's actually
why he's reaching out.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.541
He's giving us and the other
neighbor first crack.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.808
Forward me the e-mail, I'll
investigate it in the morning.

36:03.690 --> 36:06.625
(groans)

36:06.660 --> 36:08.628
Don't you feel even
a little bit bad?
About?

36:08.660 --> 36:10.651
I mean, it's our fault
that Trent moved out.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.327
If he was still
living next door,

36:12.370 --> 36:13.792
he wouldn't have this issue
with his insurance.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.796
We were an irresistible force,
he was a movable object.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.239
He moved.

36:19.270 --> 36:20.828
If you want to feel
bad about something,

36:20.870 --> 36:22.838
feel bad about the fact that
we're no closer to identifying

36:22.880 --> 36:25.348
Charlotte's killer
than we were five hours ago.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.371
What if Charlotte
wasn't the target?

36:30.850 --> 36:32.681
What if the killer knew
that she was gonna share

36:32.720 --> 36:33.687
her mushrooms with Ballantine?

36:33.720 --> 36:35.813
You have a new suspect in mind?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.680
Old one, actually.

36:39.390 --> 36:42.553
Maybe we gave up too quickly
on Alston Harper.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.368
I mean, he said he and
Ballantine buried the hatchet,

36:46.400 --> 36:47.799
but who knows?

36:47.830 --> 36:49.639
Maybe we should take
a look at him again,

36:49.670 --> 36:50.864
see if we missed anything.

36:53.540 --> 36:56.532
Alston C. Harper.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.978
Charlotte's "rache" tattoo.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.979
I seem to remember the "R"
and the "E" incrementally darker

37:04.020 --> 37:06.238
than the other letters; first,
I thought that was by design.

37:06.290 --> 37:07.689
What if there was
another reason?

37:07.720 --> 37:08.880
I think you're right.

37:08.920 --> 37:10.717
Harper is worth
looking at again,

37:10.760 --> 37:12.352
but not because he wanted
to kill Ballantine,

37:12.390 --> 37:14.255
because he wanted
to kill Charlotte.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.427
What would Harper have
against Charlotte?

37:16.460 --> 37:18.894
What does any man have
against his ex?

37:20.800 --> 37:22.791
A.C.H.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.263
Alston C. Harper.

37:41.090 --> 37:45.880
Uh, class doesn't start
for another 15 minutes.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.728
I assume you're here
for the lecture on cortisol.

37:48.760 --> 37:50.352
No, we're here to see

37:50.400 --> 37:51.719
the fight-or-flight response
in person.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.328
You're being arrested

37:53.370 --> 37:54.997
for the murder
of Charlotte Konig.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.032
Why would I murder
my former grad student?

37:58.070 --> 38:01.039
Not just a student, your wife.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.038
Apparently, one of
the stupid things you did

38:03.080 --> 38:05.469
when you were on hallucinogens
was marry Charlotte.

38:05.510 --> 38:07.649
BELL: Marriage certificate
for Alston C. Harper

38:07.680 --> 38:09.910
and Charlotte Konig,

38:09.950 --> 38:12.316
issued four years ago
in Bad Tolz, Germany.

38:12.350 --> 38:15.353
There's no divorce decree
on file,

38:15.390 --> 38:17.415
so legally you and Charlotte
were still husband and wife

38:17.460 --> 38:18.825
at the time of her death.

38:18.860 --> 38:20.919
We were estranged.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.325
When I made my break

38:22.360 --> 38:23.998
from Joe and his...

38:24.030 --> 38:26.328
expanded lifestyle, I couldn't
be with Charlotte anymore.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.894
It wasn't good for me.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.568
HOLMES: She didn't like
that though, did she?

38:29.600 --> 38:31.966
She was still in love with you.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.807
I mean, she'd already
gone to the trouble

38:33.840 --> 38:36.070
of having your initials tattooed
on the back of her shoulder.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.668
WATSON:
After you broke her heart,

38:37.710 --> 38:40.372
she added an "R" and an "E,"

38:40.410 --> 38:42.048
turning "A.C.H." into "rache."

38:42.080 --> 38:46.380
You were the one she wanted
to take revenge against.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.012
She tried to hold you up
on the divorce, right?

38:48.050 --> 38:49.688
Claimed a chunk of
the proceeds from your books.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.928
After all, she helped you
do the research.

38:52.960 --> 38:55.451
That's why you had them pulled,
to spite her.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.127
This is all conjecture.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.525
HOLMES:
No, it's not.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.526
You recently hired
a private detective,

39:00.570 --> 39:02.367
one Duane Weaver.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.061
Fortunately for us,

39:04.100 --> 39:06.898
P.I.s are not legally bound
by client privilege.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.773
They're quite free to discuss
their cases with the police.

39:09.810 --> 39:11.778
Duane told us Charlotte
approached you a few months ago

39:11.810 --> 39:14.449
and finally offered a divorce,
no strings attached.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.869
You got suspicious and hired him
to look into her.

39:16.920 --> 39:18.387
That's not illegal.

39:18.420 --> 39:19.717
HOLMES:
Duane's more than competent.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.548
He uncovered Charlotte's
real estate holdings

39:22.590 --> 39:24.581
and her attempts
to strong-arm Zerakem

39:24.630 --> 39:25.881
into a generous buyout.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.079
WATSON:
That's why she was

39:27.130 --> 39:29.690
finally willing
to grant you the divorce.

39:29.730 --> 39:31.698
She was in love,
she was about to get rich;

39:31.730 --> 39:34.437
she didn't need
to seek revenge anymore.

39:34.470 --> 39:35.937
Only, you wanted
revenge against her,

39:35.970 --> 39:38.165
for the years she'd held
your feet to the flames.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.737
You realized _
that you could have it

39:40.770 --> 39:43.705
and get rich in the process.

39:43.740 --> 39:45.401
As Charlotte's legal husband,
you would inherit

39:45.450 --> 39:47.600
all of her properties
when she died.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.641
Then you could
sell them to Zerakem.

39:49.680 --> 39:52.114
You have no evidence.

39:52.150 --> 39:54.186
Duane is lying.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.154
We have enough for a warrant.

39:56.190 --> 39:58.556
We already searched
your on-campus lab.

39:58.590 --> 40:01.491
Guess what we found.

40:01.530 --> 40:03.122
You manufactured
synthetic death cap p0ison.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.991
_We found residue
in your eqUIpment.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.897
You poisoned Charlotte,
and then you inadvertently

40:07.930 --> 40:10.490
killed Ballantine
and five innocent people.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.839
*

40:16.710 --> 40:18.439
(handcuffs clicking)

40:20.610 --> 40:22.612
*

40:22.650 --> 40:23.810
(doorbells jingle)

40:23.850 --> 40:25.442
Hi.

40:25.490 --> 40:26.741
I take it you
got my offer.

40:26.790 --> 40:29.588
Here _to talk terms
or just gloat?

40:29.620 --> 40:31.087
Bearing gifts, actually.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.657
If you can
prove arson,

40:33.690 --> 40:36.796
you should be able to collect
insurance for the fire.

40:36.830 --> 40:39.128
So... this should do it.

40:39.170 --> 40:42.162
Pictures of a van?

40:42.200 --> 40:44.168
Captured by
our security cameras.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.532
This van was parked
outside our brownstone

40:46.570 --> 40:48.970
a few hours before the fire,
when your guests were out.

40:49.010 --> 40:52.639
But no one in the neighborhood
hired an electrician that day.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.171
And in fact, this electrician
works almost exclusively

40:55.220 --> 40:57.176
for the Point Center,
a boutique hotel.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.188
Oh, I know it; it's a
couple of blocks down.

40:59.220 --> 41:01.609
In fact, the owner of
the hotel has tried

41:01.660 --> 41:04.549
to get every AwayKay in the
neighborhood to shut down.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.478
Yesterday he tried again.

41:06.530 --> 41:08.555
He said that your fire proved

41:08.600 --> 41:10.693
that AwayKays were
unsafe and underinsured.

41:10.730 --> 41:14.598
He hired an electrician
to start the fire?

41:14.640 --> 41:17.131
I spoke to
the arson investigators.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.967
The electrician is in custody,

41:19.010 --> 41:22.207
and the hotel's owner should be
in jail by the end of the day.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.208
Well, ifI get an
insurance settlement,

41:24.240 --> 41:26.242
H can rebuild, I-I
don't have to sell.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.976
You can also reopen
your AwayKay,

41:29.020 --> 41:31.477
but we would much rather
you moved back in.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.915
Robert Frost said that fences
make good neighbors.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.281
But maybe that's
because there wasn't

41:39.330 --> 41:41.798
sound-dampening
insulation back then.

41:41.830 --> 41:46.119
Since you are rebuilding anyway,
we can have it installed for you

41:46.170 --> 41:48.559
as a belated housewarming gift.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.591
So a quieter home for you,

41:50.640 --> 41:53.632
and a neighbor who knows
what he's getting into for us.

41:53.670 --> 41:55.137
You don't even know me.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.239
We'd like to.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.249
All right.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.647
When I get the insurance
settlement, I'll let you know.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.585
This is from Sherlock.

42:07.620 --> 42:10.157
He wants you to know that bees
can be good neighbors, too.
