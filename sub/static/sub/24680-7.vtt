00:02.135 --> 00:05.171
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.171 --> 00:08.080
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.080 --> 00:09.609
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.407
These are their stories.

00:13.712 --> 00:19.645
Thank you for the dance,
Mr. Fineman.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.645
Oh, you are bruised.

00:23.160 --> 00:27.490
- Did I do that?
- No, no, it wasn't you.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.813
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

00:29.813 --> 00:32.186
You aren't the one who decides.

00:32.186 --> 00:33.887
I don't know how it happened.

00:33.887 --> 00:34.899
Let's not make a fuss.

00:34.899 --> 00:36.812
Is everything all right at home, Lena?

00:36.812 --> 00:39.997
Everything's fine.
Please, I'm okay.

00:39.997 --> 00:42.997
Thank you for the meds, Doctor.

00:43.791 --> 00:45.963
The down payment was present enough.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.963
But if you want to,
you can make empanadas for my party.

00:49.988 --> 00:52.445
Honey, we can't go.

00:52.445 --> 00:54.445
Your dad's got a huge deadline.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.557
He always does.

00:55.557 --> 00:58.821
But you can come,
can't you?

00:58.821 --> 01:02.900
It's better I stay home.
I'm so proud of you.

01:02.900 --> 01:04.674
Claire, you got a good job.

01:04.674 --> 01:07.440
And now your own home.
This is what a mother works for.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.440
Love you too, Mom.

01:10.531 --> 01:14.172
Oh, that's nasty.
How'd you get that?

01:14.172 --> 01:16.491
From work. Don't worry.

01:16.491 --> 01:20.098
Let's find you something nice.

01:22.167 --> 01:25.631
Honey, I'm home.

01:30.186 --> 01:32.784
Honey?

01:35.668 --> 01:38.668
How long are we gonna be married
before you know how I like my burgers?

01:39.369 --> 01:42.625
Stay out of my way.!

01:48.875 --> 01:52.521
Yankees lose again, Lance?

02:00.117 --> 02:02.905
- Lance, what's...
- Help me! I need a crowbar.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.667
- What's going on?
- Lena's locked herself in the basement bathroom.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.348
I don't have a key,
and she's not answering.

02:07.348 --> 02:10.348
There's... There's blood.
I think she's hurt.

02:10.878 --> 02:14.411
Lena.!
I saw her feet.

02:14.411 --> 02:15.718
She's leaning up against the door.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.990
- I think...
- There we go.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.282
Lena! Lena! Lena!

02:20.282 --> 02:22.188
Oh, my God, Lena!

Law & Order CI 
3x07 A Murderer Among us

03:06.191 --> 03:08.768
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/11/09

03:11.425 --> 03:13.697
Neighbors heard them arguing around 7:00.

03:13.697 --> 03:17.061
Brody's story goes that they made up,
went to bed.

03:17.061 --> 03:18.507
When he woke up,
she was gone.

03:18.507 --> 03:20.912
- What does Brody think happened?
- He hasn't said.

03:20.912 --> 03:21.903
You have the murder weapon?

03:21.903 --> 03:24.903
I'm still lookin'.

03:25.193 --> 03:27.207
That bruise on her wrist is a few days old.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.261
He's gone after her before.

03:31.662 --> 03:38.066
But, uh,
this one she got tonight, huh?

03:40.727 --> 03:43.876
Mm, the argument,
do you know what it was about?

03:43.876 --> 03:47.290
Well, he claims that she threw out
one of his model boats.

03:47.290 --> 03:49.300
He killed her over a toy boat?

03:49.300 --> 03:54.281
Yeah, men, they get very attached to toys.

03:54.281 --> 03:59.619
Okay, she was stabbed,
choked, beaten.

04:01.529 --> 04:03.012
That's three types of assault.

04:03.012 --> 04:06.451
Most spousal murders only involve one.

04:06.451 --> 04:11.126
This is as simple as it gets.
It's an argument that got ugly.

04:14.215 --> 04:16.935
Uh, can I get a hand?

04:21.947 --> 04:24.888
Ready?

04:30.007 --> 04:33.007
Swedish carving knife.

04:33.971 --> 04:36.971
So, Brody just doesn't assemble boats,

04:38.929 --> 04:42.851
he carves each piece out of wood.

04:42.851 --> 04:46.041
And leaves murder weapons
where we can find them.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.770
Well, he drops it, she falls on it.
He panics. He locks her in.

04:49.770 --> 04:53.450
Wasn't she leaning against the door
when the neighbors found her?

04:53.450 --> 04:57.377
Listen. If Brody hadn't been involved in
that bid-rigging case in Queens,

04:57.377 --> 04:59.354
Major Case wouldn't even be here.

04:59.354 --> 05:04.941
Uh, excuse me. Um, did he say 
what kind of boat she threw away?

05:04.941 --> 05:07.886
Some kind of Rainbow.

05:10.752 --> 05:16.037
Uh, uh, theJ-Yacht Rainbow?

05:18.778 --> 05:21.778
This is a New York boat.

05:24.213 --> 05:27.213
Won the America's Cup in 1934.

05:30.285 --> 05:33.285
Well, you might be right about Brody, Detective.

05:34.451 --> 05:37.439
If he's the killer,

05:37.439 --> 05:40.439
I don't want somebody else to take the fall.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.615
Let's give him some options.

05:44.615 --> 05:48.915
I woke up,
and she wasn't there.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.697
If she had heard something,

05:50.697 --> 05:53.697
sh-she would have gotten me up.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.785
I just don't...

05:55.785 --> 05:58.219
Is there anyone who might
have wanted to harm your wife?

05:58.219 --> 06:02.205
Or you? Maybe someone connected with
the bid-rigging case?

06:02.205 --> 06:03.373
I was cleared of that.

06:03.373 --> 06:06.078
But four other suppliers were arrested.

06:06.078 --> 06:08.248
Maybe one of them blames you.

06:08.248 --> 06:10.460
For what?
I didn't know anything.

06:10.460 --> 06:13.205
Yerba mate.

06:13.205 --> 06:15.127
Your wife is from South America.

06:15.127 --> 06:17.114
Argentina.

06:17.114 --> 06:20.245
My grandparents sent her to live here
when she was a teenager.

06:20.245 --> 06:22.679
It's mate.
It's a tea.

06:22.679 --> 06:25.679
Gives you a boost.

06:26.462 --> 06:28.610
Was your wife under a lot of stress?

06:28.610 --> 06:31.964
Lena's been a little...

06:31.964 --> 06:33.727
disorganized lately.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.876
Disorganized?
Do you mean depressed?

06:36.876 --> 06:38.943
Mom was a positive person.

06:38.943 --> 06:40.666
She was... She was happy yesterday.

06:40.666 --> 06:44.122
She was helping me
with my housewarming party.

06:44.122 --> 06:49.089
We need to know if any of your
wife's injuries predated her attack.

06:49.089 --> 06:53.960
This could be difficult,
but if you could look at these photos.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.793
Those bruises were on her neck.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.046
No. She didn't have these.

07:00.046 --> 07:02.828
This one was on her knee.

07:02.828 --> 07:05.828
Her right knee.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.721
What is it, Mr. Brody?

07:11.721 --> 07:14.897
Nothing.
I just never saw this.

07:14.897 --> 07:19.830
Well, these cuts and bruises were on her hands.

07:22.106 --> 07:26.478
Uh, that bruise on her wrist,
she told me she got that at work.

07:26.478 --> 07:29.707
Yeah, that's right.

07:29.707 --> 07:33.876
Mr. Brody,
if you need a moment,

07:33.876 --> 07:35.744
you know, to let go,
it's all right.

07:35.744 --> 07:37.258
What makes you think l...

07:37.258 --> 07:39.735
Well, you're pressing your thumb
into your forefinger.

07:39.735 --> 07:43.213
Some people, they bite their lips.
They clench their fists.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.629
Can we just get on with this?

07:45.629 --> 07:49.942
I know, it's hard.
You feel the guilt.

07:49.942 --> 07:52.482
About the argument,
you know.

07:52.482 --> 07:57.409
Y-You're thinking that she was selfish...
to get so upset about a boat.

07:57.409 --> 07:58.912
Of course, I wish it didn't happen.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.204
Yeah, you were thinking about
all the hard work that you did, you know.

08:02.204 --> 08:05.926
The...The months that you put in...carving

08:05.926 --> 08:13.891
and putting each plank into place.

08:13.891 --> 08:16.452
It was on your bench.

08:16.452 --> 08:17.865
L-I don't understand.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.865
It wasn't there last night.

08:26.421 --> 08:28.551
This is some kind of trick.

08:28.551 --> 08:29.988
I know how you people work.

08:29.988 --> 08:32.873
You make the truth sound like a lie.

08:32.873 --> 08:35.330
I'm not talking to you anymore.

08:35.330 --> 08:38.330
Come on, sweetheart.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.424
Brooklyn Home for the jewish aged Brooklyn
New York, Wednesday, July 15

08:43.424 --> 08:46.594
She ever show up with
any unexplained bruises before?

08:46.594 --> 08:48.418
No.

08:48.418 --> 08:51.343
But right away you suspected her husband?

08:51.343 --> 08:52.756
Why is that?
You'd met him?

08:52.756 --> 08:55.681
When he'd pick Lena up on
his way home from work,

08:55.681 --> 08:58.973
he'd always come half hour
early just to sit in the sunroom.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.352
He was checking up on her.
Is that what you thought?

09:01.352 --> 09:02.278
Yes.

09:02.278 --> 09:04.226
How often did he do this?

09:04.226 --> 09:07.581
The first time was when she
first started to work here,

09:07.581 --> 09:09.027
last September.

09:09.027 --> 09:11.200
But then he stopped after
a couple of weeks.

09:11.200 --> 09:16.687
And then, a few times,
two months ago in May.

09:18.028 --> 09:20.361
She was friendly.

09:20.361 --> 09:22.909
She's attractive.

09:22.909 --> 09:25.228
Maybe her husband had
a reason to be suspicious.

09:25.228 --> 09:28.228
No. But some men don't need
a reason to pick on their wives.

09:30.928 --> 09:33.018
This is the fatal cut here.

09:33.018 --> 09:35.066
But these abrasions are superficial.

09:35.066 --> 09:39.120
The blood vessels in
her eyes were uncontracted.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.714
He didn't apply enough
pressure to strangle her.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.374
She fought him off.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.278
Maybe.

09:46.278 --> 09:50.857
Look. These cuts on the top of the wrists.

09:50.857 --> 09:54.926
You know, if she was defending herself...
You mean defending herself like a girl.

09:54.926 --> 09:57.926
What if she was defending herself like a boxer?

09:58.689 --> 10:01.064
Hey, score one for the new kid.

10:01.064 --> 10:05.233
Now, this old bruise on her wrist,
that's another superficial injury.

10:05.233 --> 10:08.036
This bruise on her knee,
not enough to put her down.

10:08.036 --> 10:09.921
No, the kneecap's not bruised.

10:09.921 --> 10:11.375
If Brody had hit her with enough force,

10:11.375 --> 10:12.988
he would have split the patella in three.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.528
There's no getting up after that.

10:14.528 --> 10:17.657
Even ifhe didn't kneecap her,
he was still looking to hurt her.

10:17.657 --> 10:22.396
Yes, but this lady wasn't
feeling anybody's pain.

10:22.396 --> 10:27.118
Tox screen showed 30 milligrams
of Percocet in her bloodstream,

10:27.118 --> 10:28.581
taken within three hours.

10:28.581 --> 10:31.468
Hmm. All for a sore wrist?

10:31.468 --> 10:34.468
Well, maybe she knew it'd
be a rough night.

10:34.637 --> 10:38.010
The contract was for window gates
for schools in Queens.

10:38.010 --> 10:41.079
Four of the suppliers conspired
to jack up their bids.

10:41.079 --> 10:44.228
Brody bowed out.
Said he couldn't meet the delivery schedule.

10:44.228 --> 10:47.645
He still could have rolled on those guys.
alk to Charlie Reid in the Rackets Bureau.

10:47.645 --> 10:49.551
He owes me one.

10:49.551 --> 10:51.987
If it's all right,
I'd like to go with you.

10:51.987 --> 10:54.987
Sure. You can carry me up the stairs.

10:57.382 --> 11:00.429
If it's not cars, it's boats.

11:00.429 --> 11:03.887
There's something stuck in the rigging.

11:03.887 --> 11:07.874
Oh, how exciting.
Well, I'm off to the D.A. 's office.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.635
Coming?

11:09.635 --> 11:12.602
What is it?

11:12.602 --> 11:16.320
Lint?
Uh, blue sweater lint.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.184
Last call for the D.A.'s office.

11:18.184 --> 11:21.184
Thanks. Maybe next time.

11:23.580 --> 11:28.730
Like something is broken off
the top of the masthead,

11:28.730 --> 11:32.106
right above the shroud.

11:32.106 --> 11:34.583
Maybe a flagpole.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.344
We're gonna go look for it,
aren't we?

11:37.344 --> 11:39.983
Yeah.

11:42.217 --> 11:43.551
Who is it?

11:43.551 --> 11:44.952
It's me. Leo.

11:44.952 --> 11:47.952
Come in.

11:50.402 --> 11:53.919
I just wanna say I'm sorry for Mrs. Brody.

11:53.919 --> 11:56.213
She was a very nice lady.

11:56.213 --> 11:58.342
Thanks.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.405
Good night, Mr. Brody.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.201
Ah, blue sweater.

12:27.678 --> 12:30.678
The New York Yacht Club flag.

12:34.094 --> 12:36.079
Lena hid the boat in here,

12:36.079 --> 12:39.079
but she told Brody that she threw it away.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.584
To provoke an argument?

12:42.584 --> 12:45.584
Then she put the boat back when he was asleep?

12:53.145 --> 12:56.145
To make him look like a liar.

12:57.802 --> 13:01.097
The defensive wounds that didn't defend.

13:01.097 --> 13:05.002
The strangling that didn't choke.

13:05.002 --> 13:08.002
The Percocet to dull the pain.

13:09.703 --> 13:11.792
She staged it.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.514
She killed herself.

13:13.514 --> 13:16.520
Just to frame her husband?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.427
That's insane.

13:19.427 --> 13:22.427
Or desperate.

13:24.208 --> 13:27.208
All the defensive wounds are
in straight up-and-down lines.

13:28.013 --> 13:30.896
That's very uncharacteristic of an attack.

13:30.896 --> 13:33.537
And they're superficial.

13:33.537 --> 13:36.484
Most defense wounds are usually deep.

13:36.484 --> 13:38.207
The blood near the workbench,
that was her too?

13:38.207 --> 13:40.847
To make it appear there was a chase.

13:40.847 --> 13:42.875
Her husband was abusing her.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.453
Maybe she thought killing herself
was her only way out.

13:45.453 --> 13:47.339
And framing him was her payback.

13:47.339 --> 13:49.625
I can go with the suicide,
but what's the evidence he abused her?

13:49.625 --> 13:54.865
- One bruised wrist?
- You know, maybe it was worse than abuse.

13:54.865 --> 14:00.579
Something that she couldn't live with.

14:00.579 --> 14:03.579
I'll keep it on the books as an open homicide.

14:04.036 --> 14:06.377
Aprtment of Claire Brody
153 West 43rd Street
Mondy, July 21

14:06.377 --> 14:07.957
It's a nice place you have here.

14:07.957 --> 14:10.957
You bought it, what,
two months ago?

14:12.248 --> 14:15.248
It happened so quickly.

14:15.707 --> 14:17.733
Brand-new Joy of Cooking.

14:17.733 --> 14:24.926
My mother bought me one
when I got my first apartment.

14:24.926 --> 14:29.117
Was there a reason you decided to move out?

14:29.117 --> 14:32.226
Uh, it was Mom, actually.

14:32.226 --> 14:35.132
She offered me the down payment.

14:35.132 --> 14:37.098
Just out of the blue?

14:37.098 --> 14:40.412
Was there something going on
at home between your parents?

14:40.412 --> 14:43.073
There was nothing.

14:43.073 --> 14:48.345
I know what you want me to say,
but my father did not kill my mother.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.353
W-We know that.

14:51.353 --> 14:54.891
We think your mother killed herself.

14:54.891 --> 14:59.735
You told us that your mother
was a very positive person.

14:59.735 --> 15:01.997
Well, that's why it's important
for us to figure out

15:01.997 --> 15:05.802
why she did this terrible thing to herself.

15:05.802 --> 15:07.049
You... You can't be right.

15:07.049 --> 15:10.057
Well, maybe she told a close
friend or her parents.

15:10.057 --> 15:13.412
Her parents passed away
in Argentina a few years ago.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.684
And if there was anything,
she would have told me about it.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.100
Your mother left Argentina
in the mid-'70s, right?

15:20.100 --> 15:23.100
There were death squads,
kidnappings.

15:24.394 --> 15:28.103
You sure there wasn't some
trauma that triggered...

15:28.103 --> 15:29.664
No.

15:29.664 --> 15:32.878
No. L-I volunteer with her
at Refugees International.

15:32.878 --> 15:35.885
I've heard all her stories.
Nothing like that ever happened.

15:35.885 --> 15:39.320
Uh, Claire. Some people,

15:39.320 --> 15:44.153
they hurt themselves...
out of shame or guilt.

15:44.153 --> 15:46.110
And maybe your father did something to her.

15:46.110 --> 15:47.444
- No.
- Or to you?

15:47.444 --> 15:49.493
Dad didn't do anything.

15:49.493 --> 15:52.425
And Mom didn't do this to herself.

15:52.425 --> 15:57.656
There's no reason.
She would have told me if there was.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.051
Two months ago,
Lena got her daughter out of her home...

16:00.051 --> 16:02.264
and set her up in her own place.

16:02.264 --> 16:04.026
She was clearing the decks for her final act.

16:04.026 --> 16:08.587
Two months ago was the last time
anybody saw Brody at the old age home.

16:10.216 --> 16:12.721
Brooklyn Home for the jewish aged
brooklyn, New York, Monday, July 21

16:12.721 --> 16:17.205
Lena was lovely.
We used to have little chats together.

16:17.205 --> 16:20.663
Uh, but then she got busy, I guess.

16:20.663 --> 16:24.065
Actually, Mr. Seligman,
the office told us...

16:24.065 --> 16:29.408
that Lena was caught accessing your
financial information on the computer.

16:29.408 --> 16:33.354
Yes, I heard about that,
but I didn't care.

16:33.354 --> 16:36.354
This man, do you know him?

16:37.791 --> 16:40.902
Lena's husband. Uh...

16:40.902 --> 16:42.970
I saw him once in the sunroom...

16:42.970 --> 16:47.874
uh, when my daughter's family
came to take me out to dinner.

16:47.874 --> 16:53.493
And then I think we passed him
as we pulled out of the home.

16:53.493 --> 16:55.705
What was he doing,
watching you?

16:55.705 --> 17:01.426
Uh, I wouldn't say watching.
He... He was sitting in his car.

17:01.426 --> 17:03.876
- Is this your daughter?
- Uh, yes, that's Ruth.

17:03.876 --> 17:08.924
And the kids areJeffrey and Sarah.

17:08.924 --> 17:11.728
That's Sam, alav hashalom.

17:11.728 --> 17:14.510
Alav hashalom.

17:14.510 --> 17:17.050
Your son-in-law, he passed away.

17:17.050 --> 17:23.156
Y-Yes. Uh, in May.
He was mugged.

17:23.156 --> 17:26.713
Uh, Lena gave me a card.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.538
I think I still have it.

17:28.538 --> 17:31.538
She wrote something very nice in Spanish.

17:37.403 --> 17:39.309
"En Gan Eden este."

17:39.309 --> 17:41.214
Uh, she said it meant, uh,

17:41.214 --> 17:45.585
"May his soul be in the Garden of Eden."

17:45.585 --> 17:50.369
My Spanish must be rustier than I thought.

17:50.369 --> 17:56.559
Y-Your son-in-law,
was there an injury to his leg?

17:58.955 --> 18:04.880
They broke his knee,
and then beat him to death.

18:09.051 --> 18:12.223
How can I go to the funeral tomorrow?

18:12.223 --> 18:15.092
I don't even know who she is anymore.

18:15.092 --> 18:19.565
Your mother had her dark moods.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.023
She hid them from you.

18:23.023 --> 18:24.826
We both did,
to protect you.

18:24.826 --> 18:27.263
You should have told me!

18:27.263 --> 18:30.108
You're always hiding your emotions.

18:30.108 --> 18:35.684
- Both of you are always hiding from me.
- Claire, please don't be angry.

18:35.684 --> 18:39.814
Don't hate me.
I know, I know you're angry.

18:39.814 --> 18:43.333
Please, please, don't hate me.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.034
I couldn't take it.

18:46.034 --> 18:48.348
Sam Landau, 42, May 14.

18:48.348 --> 18:50.437
He was coming from Fordham University Library.

18:50.437 --> 18:52.467
Got mugged on the way to his car.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.902
Case is still open.

18:53.902 --> 18:56.563
Blunt instrument.

18:56.563 --> 18:59.563
- Two whacks.
- Hmm.

19:01.945 --> 19:03.789
And one to the right knee.

19:03.789 --> 19:06.789
Shattered the kneecap.
That's what brought him down.

19:08.992 --> 19:15.834
Brody tensed up when I showed him
the photo of his wife's knee injury.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.834
See, he knew.

19:19.474 --> 19:23.788
This is why Lena made this bruise.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.470
She was telling us...

19:26.470 --> 19:30.455
what her husband had done.

19:32.688 --> 19:36.186
Lena I recognize from my father's nursing home.

19:36.186 --> 19:38.642
He talked about her all the time.

19:38.642 --> 19:40.325
But her husband?
Never seen him.

19:40.325 --> 19:44.516
Did your husband have a lot of contact
with Lena during your visits to the home?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.380
No, no. I was the one who talked to the staff.

19:47.380 --> 19:50.449
We believe that there is a connection
between your husband and Mr. Brody.

19:50.449 --> 19:52.843
Maybe it was financial.

19:52.843 --> 19:55.526
Maybe he borrowed some money or invested.

19:55.526 --> 19:58.207
No, no, no.
My husband was an academic.

19:58.207 --> 20:01.207
We were very careful with our money.

20:02.092 --> 20:05.141
H-He's a complete stranger.

20:05.141 --> 20:08.272
Why... Why would he kill him?
It doesn't make any sense.

20:08.272 --> 20:11.215
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Landau.

20:11.215 --> 20:14.215
We're sorry about your husband.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.883
Um, one last thing.

20:17.883 --> 20:22.803
Were you involved in a fender bender
during the week after your husband's death?

20:22.803 --> 20:25.809
I was sitting shivah.
My car was in the garage all week.

20:25.809 --> 20:28.809
Okay. Uh, thanks.

20:33.225 --> 20:34.470
What's that about her car?

20:34.470 --> 20:37.875
The D.M. V. Said...
an insurance company called

20:37.875 --> 20:39.639
for the plates on Landau's car.

20:39.639 --> 20:44.026
They wanted to know his particulars in
regards to a hit-and-run fender bender.

20:44.026 --> 20:46.294
- This was after Landau was dead?
- Yes.

20:46.294 --> 20:47.752
Any connection to Brody?

20:47.752 --> 20:51.195
The insurance company's not
Brody's or Landau's.

20:51.195 --> 20:53.960
Maybe we can't find a connection
because there isn't one.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.130
Well, Lena thought there was. Um...

20:57.130 --> 21:01.607
That's why she looked at
the records of Landau's father-in-law.

21:01.607 --> 21:04.607
And why she did this.

21:06.185 --> 21:09.235
Landau was killed,
what, May 14?

21:09.235 --> 21:11.649
What was Brody doing?

21:11.649 --> 21:13.210
On May 14? I don't remember.

21:13.210 --> 21:14.961
I have to take my aunt to the Port Authority.

21:14.961 --> 21:18.233
All we need to talk to you is for a minute.
L-I can take this for you.

21:18.233 --> 21:22.038
Refugees International was having
a leadership training program that night.

21:22.038 --> 21:24.149
They told us your mother was there.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.808
Uh, I went with her.
That's what they told us.

21:26.808 --> 21:29.015
Do you know what time you got home?

21:29.015 --> 21:31.756
Some time between 9:30 and 10:00.

21:31.756 --> 21:33.025
What does this have to do with...

21:33.025 --> 21:35.502
Where was your dad?

21:35.502 --> 21:38.898
He was at home, taking a shower.
He'd just gotten back from work.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.682
Is that what he usually
does when he gets home,

21:40.682 --> 21:42.791
he takes a shower?

21:42.791 --> 21:46.698
No, he had trouble with his car.
He got dirty fixing it.

21:46.698 --> 21:49.214
His clothes,
were they dirty too?

21:49.214 --> 21:52.855
No. He keeps a pair of coveralls
from work in the trunk.

21:52.855 --> 21:56.741
They were in the washer when we got home
Mom put them in the dryer. What?

21:56.741 --> 21:58.708
You're still on my dad's case?

21:58.708 --> 22:01.490
My mom committed suicide.
She had depression all her life.

22:01.490 --> 22:06.540
And you just found that out from your father.

22:06.540 --> 22:10.245
I always thought Dad was
good at hiding his feelings.

22:10.245 --> 22:14.637
Now I know they both were.
We have to go.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.909
We're sorry about your sister.

22:16.909 --> 22:19.021
Sister-in-law.

22:19.021 --> 22:22.057
AuntJoy's my father's sister.
She came in for the funeral.

22:22.057 --> 22:25.057
Now she has to catch a bus back to Albany.

22:27.657 --> 22:30.178
Sam Landau was mugged just before 9:00.

22:30.178 --> 22:32.289
Gives Brody plenty of time to get home,

22:32.289 --> 22:36.115
dump his bloody coveralls into
the wash and jump into the shower.

22:36.115 --> 22:39.243
She said her father was good
at hiding his feelings.

22:39.243 --> 22:43.681
Let's see how good he is
at hiding them at us.

22:43.681 --> 22:45.910
Enterprise Sheet Metal Bronx
New york, Wednesday, July 23

22:45.910 --> 22:47.614
What's the deal with the coveralls?

22:47.614 --> 22:49.361
Can we get a pair,

22:49.361 --> 22:50.551
- see what they look like?
- Sure.

22:50.551 --> 22:52.752
- Might need to show them around.
- Mm-hmm.

22:52.752 --> 22:55.752
You suffer from anxiety?

22:56.802 --> 23:01.147
I, uh... Xanax.
Y-You, uh,

23:01.147 --> 23:04.215
you take Xanax.

23:04.215 --> 23:07.851
My wife committed suicide.
I'm not sleeping.

23:07.851 --> 23:10.429
Yeah, I'm anxious.

23:10.429 --> 23:13.990
I'll get those coveralls,
and then I'll have to ask you to leave.

23:13.990 --> 23:17.405
You told your daughter your wife
suffered from depression.

23:17.405 --> 23:18.598
Was she seeing anyone for it?

23:18.598 --> 23:21.218
No, no.
She didn't believe in shrinks.

23:21.218 --> 23:24.001
You know, people that have depression, they're,

23:24.001 --> 23:25.906
well, they're manipulative.
Did you notice that?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.771
She was. She was.

23:28.771 --> 23:30.825
You know, l-I mixed that up.

23:30.825 --> 23:34.421
Actually, uh, manipulation is
not a symptom of depression.

23:34.421 --> 23:38.224
Manipulation is a symptom of
the psychopathic personality.

23:38.224 --> 23:42.504
Well, Lena was a complicated person.

23:42.504 --> 23:47.280
Well, maybe she's manipulative
because she's hiding something.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.493
Uh, don't touch anything on the floor.

23:49.493 --> 23:52.488
- You ever handle one of these?
- Hey, I worked the line 12 years.

23:52.488 --> 23:54.251
I worked my way up to partner.

23:54.251 --> 23:57.198
This thing would come in handy in
a dangerous situation, you know.

23:57.198 --> 23:59.804
You keep one of these in your car for protection?

23:59.804 --> 24:02.016
You know, bad guys,
they really do that, you know.

24:02.016 --> 24:05.433
One good hit in the knee,
bring you down for good.

24:05.433 --> 24:08.011
The kneecap,
just shatters into pieces.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.258
- Why don't you put that thing down 
- Like this.

24:09.258 --> 24:11.839
before you hurt somebody.

24:11.839 --> 24:14.925
By the way, that kneecap?

24:14.925 --> 24:16.263
Belongs to Sam Landau.

24:16.263 --> 24:18.821
- Who?
- Son-in-law of one of Lena's patients.

24:18.821 --> 24:20.544
He was murdered last May.

24:20.544 --> 24:23.533
I don't know the man.

24:23.533 --> 24:27.135
There you go doing that thing
with your thumb and your forefinger.

24:27.135 --> 24:29.191
That's because I'm trying to control myself,

24:29.191 --> 24:31.791
to keep from physically
throwing you out of my plant.

24:31.791 --> 24:34.309
That right there,
that's irritability.

24:34.309 --> 24:37.628
That's one of the paradoxical side
effects of Xanax, you know.

24:37.628 --> 24:41.043
It's used to keep people calm,
but sometimes it...

24:41.043 --> 24:43.948
Well, you use it.
Describe how it's making you feel.

24:43.948 --> 24:46.343
I wouldn't know.
This is my first time taking it.

24:46.343 --> 24:48.700
Is it?
You should be careful,

24:48.700 --> 24:51.700
'cause it can sneak up on ya.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.432
Well, he's a better boat
builder than he is a liar.

24:57.432 --> 24:58.767
- The pill bottle?
- Mm-hmm?

24:58.767 --> 25:01.243
It indicated a refill.
He's taken Xanax before.

25:01.243 --> 25:04.387
Seems like a petty thing to lie about.

25:04.387 --> 25:07.387
Well, it's the little lies
that tell the big story.

25:08.558 --> 25:10.894
The previous refill was on May the 12th.

25:10.894 --> 25:13.699
Two days before Landau was killed.

25:13.699 --> 25:16.991
He was settling his nerves for the big event.

25:16.991 --> 25:18.939
There was another refill before that?

25:18.939 --> 25:22.110
Yes. Let me see.
Last September.

25:22.110 --> 25:26.923
When Lena started working
at the nursing home.

25:26.923 --> 25:29.923
And the first time
that Brody dropped in on her.

25:31.361 --> 25:35.164
Jeff Demsky, killed
in Jersey City last September.

25:35.164 --> 25:36.985
Same M.O. As Landau.

25:36.985 --> 25:39.687
Blow to the right knee,
two whacks to the head.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.497
Classified as a mugging.

25:41.497 --> 25:44.765
He's the nephew of a resident
at Lena's nursing home.

25:44.765 --> 25:49.760
Both crimes at night,
deserted area, no witnesses.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.217
He's pretty good.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.858
He's a work in progress.

25:54.858 --> 25:59.234
In addition to his shattered kneecap,

25:59.234 --> 26:04.159
Demsky had a hairline fracture
to his lateral condyle.

26:04.159 --> 26:07.391
Now, Brody hit him twice in the knee.

26:07.391 --> 26:12.827
With Landau,
he only needed one shot.

26:12.827 --> 26:15.827
He's on a learning curve.

26:17.449 --> 26:20.449
It's not your fault.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.301
I know you're good.

26:25.301 --> 26:26.880
It was him.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.880
We were fine before...

26:32.667 --> 26:35.667
What do you want?

26:42.369 --> 26:45.369
I'm not weak anymore.

26:48.419 --> 26:50.937
Eight murders over seven years.

26:50.937 --> 26:53.210
All of them with similar M.O.'s.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.626
The first one,
uh, Mark Simmons.

26:55.626 --> 26:59.451
Multiple hits to both knees.
Multiple hits to the head.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.642
Went into a coma for two days and died.

27:01.642 --> 27:03.385
Brody's aim improved.

27:03.385 --> 27:05.475
And all the victims have
a connection to the Brodys?

27:05.475 --> 27:08.809
Only four. Besides Landau and Demsky,

27:08.809 --> 27:11.266
we have Rafe Benjamin and Eric Sumners.

27:11.266 --> 27:14.203
They both worked in New York Hospital
when Lena worked there.

27:14.203 --> 27:18.578
Then maybe all we're dealing with
is a statistical anomaly.

27:18.578 --> 27:23.625
The M.E. Noted "special requests"
for the handlings of the bodies.

27:23.625 --> 27:26.632
Uh, the first one, uh,
Mark Simmons?

27:26.632 --> 27:30.498
The family requests burial within 24 hours.

27:30.498 --> 27:35.037
Jean-Michel Levigne...
family refuses autopsy.

27:35.037 --> 27:39.067
Eric Simmons...
burial within 24 hours.

27:39.067 --> 27:42.792
And Rafe Benjamin,
Jonathan Daniels, Phillip Burns...

27:42.792 --> 27:46.984
all the same requests.

27:46.984 --> 27:48.543
They're allJewish.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.265
Brody's killing Jews.

27:50.265 --> 27:53.265
And Lena found out.

27:57.333 --> 28:00.666
No swastikas,
no anti-Semitic literature.

28:00.666 --> 28:02.471
We're still checking the computer,

28:02.471 --> 28:05.471
but I came across this.

28:09.111 --> 28:12.111
Uh, Mr. Prescott.

28:12.343 --> 28:16.536
We found your business card in,
uh, Brody's kitchen.

28:16.536 --> 28:19.424
- Y-You're an insurance adjuster.
- Uh, yes.

28:19.424 --> 28:24.246
You didn't happen to look up
a license plate of a Sam Landau a while back?

28:24.246 --> 28:28.521
Yes. Lena asked me.
She bumped into a parked car.

28:28.521 --> 28:35.060
You know, you don't remember
what she wrote it on, do you?

28:35.060 --> 28:36.843
A folded little scrap of paper.

28:36.843 --> 28:39.155
It was hard to read.
Paper had gotten wet.

28:39.155 --> 28:42.155
From the wash in Brody's coveralls.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.808
Lena found a number.
She was suspicious.

28:47.808 --> 28:53.139
When she knew whose car it was,
she started putting things together.

28:53.139 --> 28:56.739
Hey, uh, I thought she killed herself.

28:56.739 --> 28:59.739
That's what it's looking like.

29:02.178 --> 29:05.860
Brody, he's... he's very angry.

29:05.860 --> 29:09.318
He says that those people drove her to it.

29:09.318 --> 29:10.855
What people?

29:10.855 --> 29:13.376
You know,
from the nursing home.

29:13.376 --> 29:19.356
- That's forJewish people.
- Yeah, right, those people.

29:19.356 --> 29:21.658
You know, he must be quite an open-minded guy,

29:21.658 --> 29:23.871
you know,
otherwise he wouldn't have let her work there.

29:23.871 --> 29:28.185
No, Lance isn't a big fan ofJewish people.

29:28.185 --> 29:29.850
Well, why'd she take the job?

29:29.850 --> 29:31.732
I don't think she knew before.

29:31.732 --> 29:33.638
She sure found out after.

29:33.638 --> 29:34.730
Why? What happened?

29:34.730 --> 29:38.408
Lena kept after him to go with her to this,

29:38.408 --> 29:42.132
uh, meal, at the home.
This... This religious meal.

29:42.132 --> 29:43.792
And finally, he just said, uh,

29:43.792 --> 29:48.290
"I'm not missing the play-offs
to eat cracker ball soup with a bunch of..."

29:48.290 --> 29:54.217
Well, he used the "K" word is
what you call it now.

29:54.217 --> 30:03.500
Right, uh, the "K" word.
Thanks.

30:03.500 --> 30:10.144
Well, Lena was testing him,
goading him into showing his true colors.

30:10.144 --> 30:15.633
You know, she wanted to make sure...
about his anti-Semitism.

30:15.633 --> 30:19.441
All these years she didn't know?

30:19.441 --> 30:25.262
Well, or...
didn't know how vicious it was.

30:28.650 --> 30:34.249
The first victim...
was killed seven years ago.

30:36.116 --> 30:39.116
I mean, it just didn't happen out of the blue.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.733
Home of Joy Brody Troy
New york, Friday, July 25

30:43.733 --> 30:45.986
Yes, that's right,
seven years ago.

30:45.986 --> 30:49.157
Our mother died of cancer.
She was 64.

30:49.157 --> 30:52.144
Could have told you that on the phone.

30:52.144 --> 30:54.744
Uh, well, we like getting out of the city.

30:54.744 --> 30:58.405
Um, how did your brother
take your mother's death?

30:58.405 --> 31:00.965
I'm not sure I wanna discuss
my brother with you.

31:00.965 --> 31:02.988
Well, we're thinking that
they were pretty close.

31:02.988 --> 31:08.771
I mean, she lived up here in Troy,
but he buried her in Queens,

31:08.771 --> 31:11.494
near to where he lives.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.748
Lance thought he let her down.

31:13.748 --> 31:19.002
How? By not making sure that
she got the best of care?

31:19.002 --> 31:22.296
H-Her doctors wereJewish? Asian?

31:22.296 --> 31:25.202
No, he was Indian.

31:25.202 --> 31:28.886
He was very caring.
Even Lena thought so.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.845
She was close to your mother?

31:30.845 --> 31:34.361
Lena and Mom liked each other. She...

31:34.361 --> 31:37.961
Lena called her "esfuegra."

31:37.961 --> 31:39.868
That's Spanish for "mother-in-law."

31:39.868 --> 31:42.611
- You mean, "suegra." 
- Esfuegra.

31:42.611 --> 31:45.035
Lena had to write it down
so I could sound it out.

31:45.035 --> 31:48.520
I don't think Lance tried
to learn one word of Spanish

31:48.520 --> 31:52.629
his whole time with Lena.

31:52.629 --> 31:56.495
Your brother didn't put himself
out much for people, did he?

32:00.203 --> 32:05.333
Must be, uh, painful, being
estranged from your only brother.

32:05.333 --> 32:06.750
What happened between the two of you?

32:06.750 --> 32:09.369
That's none of your business.

32:09.369 --> 32:12.705
We stopped by the Troy Police
on our way over here.

32:12.705 --> 32:18.005
Your father was arrested three times
for assaulting your mother and your brother.

32:18.005 --> 32:20.708
He never beat you?

32:20.708 --> 32:23.708
I never tried to get in his way.

32:24.879 --> 32:28.195
Um, but Lance did?

32:28.195 --> 32:32.631
He tried to protect your mother?

32:32.631 --> 32:34.295
Yeah.

32:34.295 --> 32:37.591
The more he tried,
the harder Dad beat her.

32:37.591 --> 32:41.906
Once he broke her shoulder with an andiron.

32:41.906 --> 32:47.199
Lance tried to protect your mom.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.199
But you didn't.

32:51.802 --> 32:56.994
Did you think that she deserved it?
Did you think that she disappointed you?

32:56.994 --> 32:59.994
No, no, not just me,
the whole family.

33:02.729 --> 33:05.987
- She had an affair.
- Yeah, and got pregnant.

33:05.987 --> 33:09.486
Dad made up a story...
she was taken advantage of.

33:09.486 --> 33:12.816
I knew.
I saw her with him.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.858
She worked for him.

33:14.858 --> 33:18.052
I was 16.
I knew what flirting looked like.

33:18.052 --> 33:22.938
And Lance was 12,
and he believed the story.

33:22.938 --> 33:24.919
And he didn't blame your mom,
he didn't blame your dad.

33:24.919 --> 33:31.555
He blamed the man he thought raped his mother.

33:31.555 --> 33:35.214
Her boss.
Her Jewish boss.

33:35.214 --> 33:39.307
Having an affair is one thing,
but with a Jew?

33:39.307 --> 33:42.307
How could she?

33:44.354 --> 33:47.544
Brody idealized his mother.
He saw her as an innocent victim...

33:47.544 --> 33:50.573
that was raped by a man
that had power over her.

33:50.573 --> 33:54.115
Now, her death triggered a rage
that he repressed for 30 years.

33:54.115 --> 33:57.169
So he vented this rage on innocent Jewish men.

33:57.169 --> 34:00.545
Men, who were the same age,
with the same physical characteristics...

34:00.545 --> 34:02.055
as his mother's employer.

34:02.055 --> 34:05.288
Maybe the same perpetrator committed these crimes,

34:05.288 --> 34:08.887
but that perpetrator may not be Mr. Brody.

34:08.887 --> 34:12.487
Well, his wife staked her life on it.

34:12.487 --> 34:20.149
And people also commit suicide
out of shame and helplessness.

34:20.149 --> 34:21.867
You know, there's something...
there's something about this crime

34:21.867 --> 34:24.867
that it just cuts so deep.

34:33.697 --> 34:37.290
I have to call my friend Steven from Princeton.

34:37.290 --> 34:40.290
He's a linguist.

34:42.889 --> 34:46.417
Ladino.
Lena was speaking Ladino.

34:46.417 --> 34:49.417
We need to call Buenos Aires.

34:50.545 --> 34:52.146
This isn't possible.

34:52.146 --> 34:53.953
My mother was depressed.
She was delusional.

34:53.953 --> 34:56.572
She saw the truth,
and she was overwhelmed.

34:56.572 --> 34:58.439
What truth?

34:58.439 --> 35:01.079
The reason why she got you out of the house.

35:01.079 --> 35:03.231
These are her parents' death certificates.

35:03.231 --> 35:07.077
Copies were sent to her from Argentina
four years ago after her father died.

35:07.077 --> 35:09.656
I don't see what this has to do with anything.

35:09.656 --> 35:14.969
Look. Your mother had
no idea until she saw these.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.587
My God.

35:26.717 --> 35:29.277
This doesn't matter.
You don't know my dad.

35:29.277 --> 35:31.003
He's not a bigot.
He's not a murderer.

35:31.003 --> 35:36.094
All right.
Prove us wrong.

35:41.644 --> 35:44.020
Honey, what are you...
Claire, are you okay?

35:44.020 --> 35:45.685
She's fine, Mr. Brody.

35:45.685 --> 35:49.486
We're about ready to close
the file on your wife's death.

35:49.486 --> 35:51.719
We found some new evidence
in your wife's suicide.

35:51.719 --> 35:54.260
Your daughter wanted us to share it with you.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.903
What is it?

35:55.903 --> 35:59.257
They found the death certificates
from Mom's parents.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.257
Okay.

36:03.145 --> 36:06.950
Those names on there...
Diego and Eva Calderera.

36:06.950 --> 36:09.448
Calderera.
That was Lena's family's name.

36:09.448 --> 36:12.448
The name underneath it.

36:14.999 --> 36:18.578
It says "Levinson," doesn't it?

36:18.578 --> 36:21.058
This must be a mistake.
These are for the wrong people.

36:21.058 --> 36:25.761
No, Dad. Mom's parents changed
their name when they got married.

36:25.761 --> 36:28.770
They wanted to move up
in Argentinean society.

36:28.770 --> 36:32.373
They figured they'd have a better
chance with the name Calderera.

36:32.373 --> 36:34.101
Levinson's a Jewish name.

36:34.101 --> 36:36.825
Lena wasn't, so her parents
couldn't be Jewish.

36:36.825 --> 36:40.875
You know those Spanish words
that Lena used to use?

36:40.875 --> 36:44.343
You know, like, um,
"esfuegra."

36:46.333 --> 36:48.945
It's actually a Jewish dialect of Spanish.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.403
It's called Ladino.

36:50.403 --> 36:52.653
And she picked that up from her parents.

36:52.653 --> 36:56.150
Lena was not Jewish.

36:56.150 --> 36:59.750
L-I would have known if she was.
I could tell.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.107
Really?
You can tell?

37:02.107 --> 37:03.898
She would have told me.
Twenty-two years of marriage,

37:03.898 --> 37:05.807
she would have said something.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.807
She didn't know till she saw the certificates.

37:10.999 --> 37:13.108
This is not possible.

37:13.108 --> 37:17.669
Dad, if Mom was Jewish,
then so am I.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.866
- Don't say that!
- It's true.

37:21.866 --> 37:24.263
You are not Jewish.
You are my daughter.

37:24.263 --> 37:27.312
And don't you dare accuse your
poor deceased mother of being a...

37:27.312 --> 37:29.747
Accuse?

37:29.747 --> 37:32.696
My wife was not a Jewess.

37:32.696 --> 37:35.696
You are not a Jewess.

37:37.441 --> 37:40.290
Claire. Claire.

37:40.290 --> 37:42.405
Claire.
Claire, please stop!

37:42.405 --> 37:43.699
Tell her these are lies.

37:43.699 --> 37:45.670
If this were true,
Lena would have told me.

37:45.670 --> 37:48.291
Uh, you think so?
Knowing how you feel aboutJews?

37:48.291 --> 37:49.798
I don't care aboutJews.

37:49.798 --> 37:51.745
You don't care about them?

37:51.745 --> 37:54.837
Even after what that Jewish man
did to your mother?

37:54.837 --> 37:57.455
Your sister told us.

37:57.455 --> 37:58.525
Be quiet about my mother.

37:58.525 --> 38:04.889
- I don't wanna hear about...
- I do. I wanna know.

38:04.889 --> 38:10.551
His mother was raped by herJewish boss.

38:10.551 --> 38:13.091
That's the way the story goes.

38:13.091 --> 38:19.082
I mean, maybe she just,
you know, liked Jewish men.

38:19.082 --> 38:22.394
You know? They excited her.
The whole forbidden fruit.

38:22.394 --> 38:25.116
You shut your dirty mouth.
He took advantage of her.

38:25.116 --> 38:26.696
He raped her.

38:26.696 --> 38:28.868
Is that why your dad beat your mom, huh?

38:28.868 --> 38:30.836
Why he broke her shoulder with an andiron?

38:30.836 --> 38:33.130
Because he couldn't do it to theJew.

38:33.130 --> 38:35.670
That guy had connections.
My dad would have lost his job.

38:35.670 --> 38:37.900
- You could have done something?
- What? I was too young.

38:37.900 --> 38:41.364
So you did nothing.
You just watched your dad...

38:41.364 --> 38:45.965
beat your mom to a pulp.
Watched him tear your family apart.

38:45.965 --> 38:48.605
- All because of theJew?
- Yes.

38:48.605 --> 38:50.078
You couldn't protect your mom?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.516
Even when she got sick,
that was his fault too?

38:52.516 --> 38:55.280
She got cancer down there where theJew had been.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.145
- He infected her.
- Stop it!

38:57.145 --> 38:59.604
The disease,
it ate her up.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.643
And you could do nothing,

39:01.643 --> 39:06.939
except for, well, choke...
on your rage and your hate.

39:06.939 --> 39:10.356
And then her death,
well, that was too much, Lance.

39:10.356 --> 39:12.609
You couldn't keep it in anymore.

39:12.609 --> 39:15.741
You had to make him pay.

39:15.741 --> 39:18.741
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:19.955 --> 39:22.535
But he was long dead, huh?

39:22.535 --> 39:24.688
Long dead,
but there were plenty.

39:24.688 --> 39:27.187
Plenty of men like him, huh?

39:27.187 --> 39:31.399
Pushy, grabby, arrogantJews.

39:31.399 --> 39:33.470
Thirty years you waited, right?

39:33.470 --> 39:35.499
How'd it feel?
Did it feel good?

39:35.499 --> 39:39.300
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Mark Simmons. Rafe Benjamin.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.228
- No!
- You owed it to her, huh?

39:41.228 --> 39:43.809
Jeff Demsky. Sam Landau.

39:43.809 --> 39:46.809
Stop it!

39:51.228 --> 39:54.338
Lena figured it out.

39:54.338 --> 39:56.530
Imagine how she felt.

39:56.530 --> 39:59.813
- A Jewish woman married to a Jew killer.
- I'm not.

39:59.813 --> 40:03.140
The horror that you used her
to find your victims.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.209
Not true!

40:04.209 --> 40:08.998
The terror...that one day you might
turn your rage against your own daughter.

40:08.998 --> 40:11.435
- Never. I would never do that.!
- Your own Jewish daughter.

40:11.435 --> 40:14.435
Never!

40:16.343 --> 40:19.375
Lena wasn't gonna take that chance.

40:19.375 --> 40:24.198
She couldn't prove that you killed those men,

40:24.198 --> 40:27.125
But she knew.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.930
And if she couldn't send you
to jail for killing them,

40:29.930 --> 40:33.817
she was gonna send you to jail for killing her.

40:33.817 --> 40:36.685
This is all a bunch of lies.
All of it.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.670
Claire, I know these people.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.842
They'll say anything.
Claire, come on.

40:40.842 --> 40:43.718
I loved your mother,
but she was sick.

40:43.718 --> 40:45.787
Why, because she was Jewish?

40:45.787 --> 40:48.530
Stop saying that!

40:48.530 --> 40:51.970
You know, there's one thing that Lena overlooked.

40:51.970 --> 40:54.637
She had the proof.

40:54.637 --> 40:56.482
She just didn't realize it.

40:56.482 --> 40:59.063
The piece of paper she found in your coveralls.

40:59.063 --> 41:01.234
The one with Landau's plate number.

41:01.234 --> 41:03.939
She made a photocopy of it
and gave it to your neighbor.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.989
Oh, what, so now you're gonna
bring Richie into this?

41:05.989 --> 41:08.549
Lena asked him to call the D.M.V.

41:08.549 --> 41:11.150
That's how she found out it was Landau's number.

41:11.150 --> 41:15.863
And the paper is gone.
I mean, you probably got rid of it.

41:15.863 --> 41:21.423
But your neighbor,
he made a photocopy of it.

41:21.423 --> 41:25.191
This is Landau's plate number
in your handwriting.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.623
This is some damn trick.
Let me see that.

41:26.623 --> 41:30.572
- No, sorry. This is...
- Let me see it!

41:30.572 --> 41:34.499
Anybody can copy handwriting.

41:34.499 --> 41:36.956
You're trying to scare me.

41:36.956 --> 41:40.456
This isn't even the right number.

41:40.456 --> 41:43.456
- It's not Landau's number?
- No. It's...

41:46.318 --> 41:49.307
Well, how do you know it's not?

41:49.307 --> 41:52.560
Oh, God! Claire.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.059
You know, because you stalked Sam Landau.

41:55.059 --> 41:58.497
You memorized his number.

41:58.497 --> 42:00.853
You tricked me.
You see this, Claire?

42:00.853 --> 42:05.005
You see this?
This is just the kind of
sneaky thing you people do.

42:05.005 --> 42:07.401
Sneaky?

42:07.401 --> 42:10.492
- Like seducing your mother?
- Tha tJew raped her.

42:10.492 --> 42:13.184
ThoseJews got everything
they had coming to them.

42:13.184 --> 42:15.378
I had a right,
after what they did to your grandmother.

42:15.378 --> 42:17.897
Your mother.!
They killed your mother.!

42:17.897 --> 42:20.497
- All right, enough.
- Get your filthy hands off of me!

42:20.497 --> 42:23.534
Lance Brody,
you're under arrest.

42:23.534 --> 42:26.276
I know what you are!

42:26.276 --> 42:28.733
Look what they do to your father, Claire!

42:28.733 --> 42:31.638
You're not one of them.!
Don't believe it.!

42:31.638 --> 42:33.749
She's not a Jew!

42:33.749 --> 42:36.576
My daughter!
Can't you tell?

42:36.576 --> 42:42.163
Just look at her!
She's not one of them!

42:43.649 --> 42:48.719
Claire.!Claire.!

42:50.915 --> 42:53.915
Lena got what she wanted.

42:54.251 --> 42:56.751
She stopped a killer.

42:56.751 --> 42:59.751
But at what cost?

43:00.500 --> 43:04.500
Maybe that's what she couldn't live with.
