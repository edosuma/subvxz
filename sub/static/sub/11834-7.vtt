<i>Previously on</i>
<i>"The Practice"...</i>

00:04.470 --> 00:05.572
"What To Expect
When You're Expecting."

00:05.606 --> 00:07.173
Somebody here's pregos.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.709
Did you order that book?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.210
Me? No.

00:10.243 --> 00:11.612
That little witch
tricked us.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.615
Either that or somebody else
is pregnant.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.250
How did that book
get here?

00:17.283 --> 00:19.352
I ordered it.
I want to keep it a secret

00:19.385 --> 00:20.754
until I'm sure
everything's fine.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.088
Who's the father?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.457
I'm going to be
a single parent.

00:24.490 --> 00:26.359
I got a lude
and lascivious scheduled

00:26.392 --> 00:28.328
for trial this morning,
but Judge Hiller--

00:28.361 --> 00:30.764
-She's ordered me
to get co-counsel.
-Why?

00:30.797 --> 00:32.766
Something about how
I've never won a trial.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.167
Bobby, it's bad for us
to even be associated

00:34.200 --> 00:36.169
with Harland Bassett.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.371
-He's a nice guy.
-And the world's
worst attorney.

00:38.404 --> 00:40.273
I do not want to be
in court with that man.

00:40.306 --> 00:42.275
I was blessed
with a large penis.

00:42.308 --> 00:43.276
What was that?

00:43.309 --> 00:45.178
I'm huge, judge.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.747
Where the hell
is this going?

00:46.780 --> 00:49.415
I would like the jury
to have a viewing.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.552
You're asking me
to let your client

00:51.585 --> 00:53.554
drop his pants in court?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.121
The intent would only be

00:55.155 --> 00:56.790
to present
exculpatory evidence.

01:06.332 --> 01:07.801
Okay.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.804
We face one last motion
to dismiss by the defense.

01:10.837 --> 01:15.208
Assuming we get by that,
the trial will start tomorrow.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.677
We will get by it,
right?

01:16.710 --> 01:18.311
I hope so.

01:18.344 --> 01:19.546
There's a chance...

01:19.580 --> 01:21.748
this may not
even go to trial?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.349
Look, I haven't met
all of you,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.519
but as I've explained to
your husband and son,

01:25.552 --> 01:27.854
this is a very uphill battle.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.856
We're prosecuting
one man for murder

01:29.890 --> 01:32.292
that another man committed
in a foreign country.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.595
But the other man
was his brother.

01:34.628 --> 01:39.165
I understand, but we've only
gotten so much cooperation

01:39.199 --> 01:40.701
from Pakistani authorities,

01:40.734 --> 01:44.337
and I've received
no help whatsoever

01:44.370 --> 01:46.239
from our own
federal government,

01:46.272 --> 01:49.342
which prefers I back off
this altogether,

01:49.375 --> 01:51.645
and quite frankly,
our case is weak.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.647
So what you're saying is

01:53.680 --> 01:55.516
you think he's going
to get away with it.

01:55.549 --> 01:57.884
I'm going to fight
for this one,

01:57.918 --> 01:59.520
you have my word,

01:59.553 --> 02:01.888
but things got a little
tougher this week.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.557
The defendant
switched lawyers,

02:03.590 --> 02:07.894
and his new lawyer
is very tough.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.731
I'm not recommending
a plea.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.766
I'm just saying
it's an option.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.301
Why would I ever agree
to a plea?

02:15.335 --> 02:16.670
I'm saying conspiracy,
not--

02:16.703 --> 02:18.471
I had nothing
to do with it.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.274
You can't condemn a man
for the actions of his brother.

02:21.307 --> 02:23.544
The jury could very well
think you were involved

02:23.577 --> 02:24.811
since it was
your own brother.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.813
Well, that's wrong.
I didn't do it.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.382
They have no evidence.
Give me one single reason

02:29.415 --> 02:32.185
why I should even
consider a plea.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.554
I'll give you three--

02:33.587 --> 02:35.656
you're Pakistani,
the victim was American,

02:35.689 --> 02:38.592
and this is Boston.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.698
â™ª (theme)

03:33.514 --> 03:36.717
If we win the motion, it's over.
We'll be back before noon.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.752
If we lose,
trial starts immediately.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.887
-What do you think?
-The law's on our side.

03:40.921 --> 03:44.257
We just got transferred to
Kittleson, so I'm optimistic.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.592
We're becoming
a niche practice,

03:45.626 --> 03:46.960
husbands who kill wives.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.829
He's innocent, Lindsay.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.963
Hello.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.501
Good morning.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.737
Ellenor?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.038
She got a date?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.606
BOBBY: What's going on?

03:59.640 --> 04:02.943
I didn't want to say
anything until--

04:02.976 --> 04:06.947
but now there's really
no reason not to.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.615
Um...

04:08.649 --> 04:10.951
I'm pregnant.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.957
Very funny.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.625
-I am.
-She is.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.594
I didn't want to jinx it

04:20.627 --> 04:22.729
before the amnio results
came back,

04:22.763 --> 04:23.897
so everything's fine.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.532
I'm four months,

04:25.566 --> 04:28.434
and I'm going to have
a baby girl.

04:28.468 --> 04:31.037
Who's the father?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.039
Actually, I'm keeping
that confidential.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.041
He's basically just
a sperm donor,

04:35.075 --> 04:38.512
and I'm going to be
a single mom.

04:38.545 --> 04:39.513
Wow.

04:39.546 --> 04:42.816
That's... fantastic.

04:42.849 --> 04:46.386
Yeah. Ellenor,
it's fabulous.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.823
You gonna be a mom?

04:49.856 --> 04:51.658
Yeah.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.629
Okay, so let's not everybody,
you know, well up.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.665
Um, Harland Bassett
to see Eugene Young.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.100
Is he available?

05:00.133 --> 05:03.369
Um...

05:03.403 --> 05:04.805
Eugene.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.874
Harland. Remember me?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.647
She's my niece,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.649
so naturally I have
a vested interest,

05:15.682 --> 05:17.651
besides her
being innocent.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.586
Is it a burglary?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.421
No, no, no,
just shoplifting.

05:21.454 --> 05:24.124
It's a false I. D., Eugene,
I swear to you.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.693
This security guard
has it all wrong. Emma--

05:26.727 --> 05:29.095
Hold on. Harland,
are you being ordered

05:29.129 --> 05:31.698
by the court again to have
co-counsel present?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.567
No.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.968
Then why?
It's a shoplifting.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.437
But it's also my niece,

05:37.470 --> 05:39.439
and I've hit
an unlucky patch

05:39.472 --> 05:43.610
since the last time
we were at trial together.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.979
My malpractice carrier
has ordered me

05:46.012 --> 05:47.981
to advise all my clients

05:48.014 --> 05:51.585
that I have never won
a jury trial.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.453
You've still never won?

05:53.486 --> 05:56.523
I've won some bench trials,
but with a jury, I--

05:56.557 --> 05:58.892
I need to get one
under my belt, Eugene,

05:58.925 --> 06:01.528
and not just because
I love my niece,

06:01.562 --> 06:03.997
but, also, it's tough
to recruit new business

06:04.030 --> 06:06.600
with this mandate
from the carrier.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.870
It's a 2-day trial, tops.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.473
I know I'm asking a lot.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.510
I need to get a "W."

06:21.915 --> 06:24.618
There is no basis in law
for these charges.

06:24.651 --> 06:27.020
A defendant can't be
an accessory-before-the-fact

06:27.053 --> 06:29.890
to a homicide that happened
in a foreign country.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.458
If there's a kidnapping
with the intent to kill,

06:32.492 --> 06:34.995
we can absolutely assert
jurisdiction here.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.429
But she wasn't kidnapped.

06:36.462 --> 06:37.864
She went to Pakistan
on vacation.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.934
He tricked her. She thought
she was going on vacation.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.936
He already arranged
for his brother

06:42.969 --> 06:45.438
to have her killed
when she arrived.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.440
Are you serious?

06:47.473 --> 06:49.442
I take it you've tried
extraditing the brother.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.711
To no avail.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.978
Approach.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.719
This seems a bit much.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.087
Why are you doing this?

07:01.121 --> 07:03.557
Your honor,
look out there.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.091
That's her family.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.794
How can I not do it?

07:07.828 --> 07:11.832
I can't say I'm overwhelmed
by the merits...

07:11.865 --> 07:14.835
but there's enough
to go forward.

07:14.868 --> 07:18.471
There's nothing
to go forward.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.073
Defendant's motion
to dismiss denied.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.608
Bring in the jury.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.014
I don't think it was
mistaken identity, counsel.

07:28.048 --> 07:31.117
Your client is
slightly distinguishable.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.054
-How so?
-She's the size of a cottage.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.590
-No offense.
-Offense taken.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.092
Is that how you
picked her out-- her size?

07:39.125 --> 07:41.094
No. Her face as well.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.129
In fact, I'd first
I. D.'d her face

07:43.163 --> 07:45.866
from a picture where you
couldn't even see her girth.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.869
A picture? You picked out
a mug shot before the lineup?

07:48.902 --> 07:52.506
She didn't have a mug shot.
This was her very first arrest.

07:52.539 --> 07:54.741
The D. A. showed me
just a regular picture.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.743
It wasn't a mug shot.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.112
You saw this photo
before the lineup?

07:59.145 --> 08:01.147
Look, counsel,
she's the one

08:01.181 --> 08:04.184
I saw lift
the merchandise.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.021
You think you can
shake him?

08:08.054 --> 08:10.557
I'm hoping it won't
even come to that.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.058
What do you mean?

08:12.092 --> 08:14.628
Well, I think we should
bring a motion to dismiss

08:14.661 --> 08:16.930
on the basis that
the I. D. was tainted.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.031
Good idea.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.633
Yes, I thought
you'd like it.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.137
On September 14th,
I examined a body

08:24.170 --> 08:25.972
that had arrived
from Pakistan.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.141
Did you make an identification
of this body?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.143
Yes. Through dental records
I established

08:30.176 --> 08:32.212
that the body belonged
to Julie McGrath.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.326
Is this how
Julie McGrath's body

08:46.359 --> 08:48.729
arrived from Pakistan?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.564
That's correct.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.833
What did
your examination reveal?

08:52.866 --> 08:56.202
There was carbon monoxide
in her blood

08:56.236 --> 08:58.572
and soot in her lungs.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.741
Also, tests revealed
gasoline residue

09:00.774 --> 09:02.275
all over her tissue.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.745
Please, doctor,
in layman's terms.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.748
She was soaked
with gasoline,

09:07.781 --> 09:10.917
set on fire,
and then burned to death.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.754
She was burned alive?

09:13.787 --> 09:16.757
Yes.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.260
Nothing further.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.231
Mr. Donnell?

09:28.635 --> 09:31.705
No questions, your honor.

09:31.738 --> 09:32.973
Ms. Gamble?

09:33.006 --> 09:36.710
Commonwealth calls
detective Michael McGuire.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.244
We received cooperation

09:38.278 --> 09:40.714
from the Lahore Police
Department in Pakistan,

09:40.747 --> 09:42.883
and they provided us
with the details

09:42.916 --> 09:43.917
of their investigation.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.351
Detective, what did

09:45.385 --> 09:46.920
the Pakistanian
investigation reveal?

09:46.953 --> 09:48.722
That it was a homicide

09:48.755 --> 09:52.826
committed by Javed Sharif,
brother of the defendant.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.094
Was he arrested?

09:54.127 --> 09:55.228
Yes, he was.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.831
Did he make
any statements?

09:57.864 --> 09:59.966
He did. He confessed
to the killing,

10:00.000 --> 10:01.668
said it was done to protect
his brother's honor.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.303
How did setting
Julie McGrath on fire

10:03.336 --> 10:05.138
protect
the defendant's honor?

10:05.171 --> 10:07.140
Ms. McGrath
had evidently engaged

10:07.173 --> 10:09.142
in an extra-marital affair.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.144
Adultery is considered
a serious breach

10:11.177 --> 10:13.146
of a man's honor
in Pakistan.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.781
In his confession,

10:14.815 --> 10:17.884
Mr. Sharif said
he set Ms. McGrath on fire

10:17.918 --> 10:22.255
to avenge
his brother's disgrace.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.725
It was an honor killing.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.893
What do you mean,
"honor killing"?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.329
In Pakistan, there's
an ancient tribal custom.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.898
A man's honor is linked
to his possessions--

10:31.932 --> 10:35.168
gold, land, women.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.704
Detective,
was Javed Sharif

10:37.738 --> 10:40.140
ever prosecuted
for this murder?

10:40.173 --> 10:41.742
No, he was not.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.143
Why is that?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.145
According to
the Pakistani government,

10:45.178 --> 10:47.881
the defendant invoked
qisas.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.249
What does that mean?

10:49.282 --> 10:51.184
Qisas is evidently
an Islamic doctrine

10:51.217 --> 10:53.453
which is actually law
in Pakistan.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.156
It allows the heirs
of a murder victim

10:56.189 --> 10:58.024
to pardon the murderer.

10:58.058 --> 11:00.460
Mr. Sharif here
is the heir,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.929
and, in fact,
pardoned his brother.

11:02.963 --> 11:06.199
So the defendant
pardoned the man

11:06.232 --> 11:08.935
who set his wife
on fire?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.904
That's correct.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.406
Thank you, detective.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.179
Under Pakistani law,
detective,

11:19.212 --> 11:21.314
what would have happened
to my client's brother

11:21.347 --> 11:24.484
had he not been pardoned?

11:24.518 --> 11:26.452
He would have faced death
by hanging.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.454
So the only way
for my client

11:28.488 --> 11:30.456
to spare the life
of his brother

11:30.490 --> 11:32.959
would be to pardon him
altogether?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.460
Yes.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.462
And, detective,
is there any evidence

11:36.496 --> 11:38.298
of my client
directing his brother

11:38.331 --> 11:39.933
to commit this crime?

11:39.966 --> 11:41.334
Not to my knowledge.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.804
Is there any evidence
that my client knew

11:43.837 --> 11:45.506
this crime
was going to happen?

11:45.539 --> 11:47.508
Not to my knowledge.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.976
Thank you.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.126
You want to do
the talking?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.360
I think
it would be nice.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.262
'Cause if you win
this motion,

12:09.295 --> 12:11.097
I'll still be denied
my jury win.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.133
MAN: All rise.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.839
Oh, no.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.306
What's she doing here?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.926
(door slams)

12:42.996 --> 12:46.533
Mr. Young, chambers.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.372
I can't tell him
not to talk. It's his case.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.375
I don't care. After what
he did the last time,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.377
he is an embarrassment.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.379
It's his niece.
I don't think he--

12:59.412 --> 13:01.381
He introduced a penis
as evidence

13:01.414 --> 13:03.917
after he had it altered.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.120
Your honor, I-I will do
my best to contain him,

13:07.153 --> 13:09.556
and I think he fully
appreciates your wrath

13:09.590 --> 13:11.525
over what happened
the last time,

13:11.558 --> 13:14.394
and it should be
a very quick trial.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.396
Well, I will hold you
responsible

13:16.429 --> 13:19.265
for any antics, counsel.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.968
You're on notice.

13:23.604 --> 13:26.106
We had been seeing each other
for about three months.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.208
-Then what happened?
-She broke it off.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.943
She wanted to work things
out with her husband.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.046
-This man?
-Yes, that's her husband.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.348
Did you ever have
any encounters with this man?

13:35.381 --> 13:37.350
Yes, when he learned
of the affair,

13:37.383 --> 13:39.252
he basically accosted me.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.221
How did he accost you, sir?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
I was leaving work.
He approached me

13:43.256 --> 13:45.491
in the parking lot
and threatened me.

13:45.526 --> 13:47.227
Could you describe
the threat?

13:47.260 --> 13:49.229
It was pretty vague.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.865
He just said,
"Stay away from my wife,"

13:51.898 --> 13:54.134
in what I perceive
to be a threatening tone.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.202
Did he say anything else?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.639
Yes. He said in his country,

13:58.672 --> 14:02.142
people were killed
for committing adultery.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.948
I take it when he said this,
he was very upset.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.050
-Yes.
-He had just found out

14:10.083 --> 14:12.418
that you had been sleeping
with his wife for three months.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.320
That's correct.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.389
This was an angry husband
blowing off steam,

14:16.422 --> 14:18.124
wasn't it, Mr. Miller?

14:18.158 --> 14:19.960
Well...

14:19.993 --> 14:21.528
Did you report him
to the police?

14:21.562 --> 14:23.496
No.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.266
So you didn't perceive
that remark to be a threat

14:26.299 --> 14:27.901
on either your life

14:27.934 --> 14:30.270
or the life
of Julie McGrath, did you?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.639
Not at the time, no.

14:35.576 --> 14:38.144
So, I don't want
to be personal,

14:38.178 --> 14:40.547
but, um, was this
artificial insemination

14:40.581 --> 14:43.149
or the old-fashioned way?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.151
You know, Lucy,

14:45.185 --> 14:47.287
despite our
deepening friendship,

14:47.320 --> 14:50.323
I'm going to choose
not to answer that.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.930
Aren't you a little scared,
Ellenor,

14:56.963 --> 14:59.165
raising a kid alone?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.201
You think it's right?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.004
Do I think it's right?

15:04.037 --> 15:07.007
Well, I mean the right thing
with your working and all.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.009
You think it's right
for you?

15:09.042 --> 15:10.544
Well, obviously
it is something

15:10.577 --> 15:13.013
that I've put
a lot of thought into.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.950
Great.
That's all I was asking.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.319
You know,
I didn't get the feeling

15:19.352 --> 15:22.656
that you were
asking anything, Jimmy.

15:22.689 --> 15:25.391
It sounded to me
more like you were commenting.

15:25.425 --> 15:28.595
I'm sorry
if you got that impression.

15:28.629 --> 15:30.964
Right.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.075
Let's not
let our hormones

15:42.108 --> 15:44.477
get the better of us.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.981
It hurts, okay?

15:50.016 --> 15:52.352
When you announced
that you were pregnant,

15:52.385 --> 15:55.321
everybody practically jumped
over the table,

15:55.355 --> 15:56.757
but with me--

15:56.790 --> 16:00.360
Well, it is a little more
unexpected with you.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.763
They'll celebrate it.
Just--

16:02.796 --> 16:04.998
Give them time?

16:05.031 --> 16:07.433
You know,

16:07.467 --> 16:11.071
I expected
to raise a few eyebrows

16:11.104 --> 16:13.707
with the people that I--

16:13.740 --> 16:18.712
But...

16:18.745 --> 16:21.281
I guess I consider
the people here

16:21.314 --> 16:23.249
to be like family,

16:23.283 --> 16:25.251
and I didn't think

16:25.285 --> 16:28.354
that I was going to
have to give you all time

16:28.388 --> 16:30.256
to get over it.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.094
Why not just be flush
with happiness

16:34.127 --> 16:38.098
if for no other reason
than because I am?

16:38.131 --> 16:41.034
Ellenor...

16:41.067 --> 16:44.004
you just sprang the news
this morning.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.042
The happiness is there.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.745
Trust me.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.422
What I am saying is
the reason the eyewitness

17:02.455 --> 17:04.223
picked my client
out of a lineup

17:04.257 --> 17:06.291
is because he was shown
a picture of her

17:06.326 --> 17:07.594
by the district attorney.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.395
The witness was identifying

17:09.429 --> 17:12.498
the woman he saw in the store,
not the picture.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.701
We can't know that.
The witness maybe can't know.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.368
He saw a familiar face.
He made--

17:16.402 --> 17:18.739
-Eugene.
-It was improper, Susan.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.272
All right.

17:20.306 --> 17:23.309
This was witness bolstering,
your honor.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.411
First of all,
this wasn't a mug shot.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.814
My client has no record.
There is no mug shot.

17:27.848 --> 17:29.816
The district attorney
took this picture

17:29.850 --> 17:31.552
out of my client's purse.

17:31.585 --> 17:34.254
-I certainly did not.
-Then how'd you get it?

17:34.287 --> 17:37.157
The witness picked it up
off the department store floor.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.126
It fell out of her purse
when she was running away.

17:42.128 --> 17:45.165
The motion to dismiss
is denied.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.669
Let's proceed with the trial.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.513
Perhaps you should have
filled me in

17:59.546 --> 18:01.515
on how they got the picture.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.249
I didn't know.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.719
Get your niece
in here, Harland.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.521
We're going to trial.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.290
Look at the bright side,
Eugene.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.359
I can still get
my jury victory now.

18:13.393 --> 18:17.631
Yes, I'm trying to contain
my delight on that.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.633
I was always close
with my sister.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.635
We were only a year apart.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.637
We were, in many ways,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.639
best friends
as well as siblings.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.674
Did your sister
confide in you

18:27.708 --> 18:29.242
that she was
committing adultery?

18:29.275 --> 18:31.512
Yes. It was I
who convinced her

18:31.545 --> 18:33.680
to be honest and tell Imaad.

18:33.714 --> 18:35.516
I certainly regret
doing that today.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.850
Why is that, sir?

18:36.883 --> 18:38.519
Because he had her killed.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.253
-Objection.
-Sustained.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.488
Mr. McGrath,
did your sister ever talk

18:42.523 --> 18:44.324
about her trip to Pakistan?

18:44.357 --> 18:45.692
Yes, she did.

18:45.726 --> 18:47.260
-Could you tell us--
-Objection-- hearsay.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.529
State of mind.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.396
I'll allow it.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.666
Could you tell us
what she said?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.400
That it was Imaad's idea

18:54.434 --> 18:55.936
as a way of reconnecting.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.805
He thought it would be good
to go back home,

18:58.839 --> 19:00.941
which she thought
was a little bizarre.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.343
Why is that?

19:03.376 --> 19:06.246
He'd always told her,
and me, too, for that matter,

19:06.279 --> 19:07.881
that he didn't enjoy
going home.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.784
He wasn't particularly
close to his family.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.686
Then suddenly she's
going there without him.

19:12.719 --> 19:14.354
Without him?

19:14.387 --> 19:16.790
Out of nowhere, he has this
project he needs to finish,

19:16.823 --> 19:19.459
so he sends her over and says
he'll join her in a few days.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.962
She never suspected he was
sending her to be executed...

19:21.995 --> 19:23.730
-Objection!
-Sustained.

19:23.764 --> 19:26.266
-While he stayed here
as an alibi.
-Objection!

19:26.299 --> 19:28.735
Sustained. Ms. Gamble,
control your witness.

19:28.769 --> 19:30.436
HELEN: Mr. McGrath,

19:30.470 --> 19:33.439
after you learned
of your sister's death,

19:33.473 --> 19:34.808
what happened?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.543
Nothing happened.

19:36.577 --> 19:38.812
The brother confessed,
said it was an honor killing,

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
and then nothing happened

19:40.681 --> 19:42.583
-because that
son of a bitch...
-BOBBY: Objection!

19:42.616 --> 19:44.484
-He made sure of it.
-Move to strike!

19:44.518 --> 19:46.286
He didn't even go
over there!

19:46.319 --> 19:48.354
I will
have you removed, sir.

19:51.792 --> 19:53.760
Mr. McGrath, please,

19:53.794 --> 19:55.729
you need to calm down.

19:55.762 --> 20:00.667
He didn't even go
over there.

20:00.701 --> 20:03.403
My sister was burned alive.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.471
Nobody did anything.

20:05.506 --> 20:08.341
That's the answer
to your question, Ms. Gamble.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.877
The Pakistani police
did nothing,

20:10.911 --> 20:14.581
our government refuses
to get involved,

20:14.615 --> 20:16.750
and nobody did anything.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.753
A beautiful woman
was murdered,

20:19.786 --> 20:22.022
and nobody did anything.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.424
(sobbing)

20:41.642 --> 20:44.277
My feeling is
they haven't made their case,

20:44.310 --> 20:45.979
but I am concerned.

20:46.012 --> 20:49.616
Their last witness
was extremely emotional.

20:49.650 --> 20:51.685
My gut says put you up there.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.287
Bec?

20:54.320 --> 20:57.057
I think there's no question.
The evidence may be thin,

20:57.090 --> 21:00.060
but they do have phone records
of you calling your brother.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.028
Yes, because I was
about to visit.

21:02.062 --> 21:03.664
People call before--

21:03.697 --> 21:06.299
I'm just saying
it doesn't look good.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.302
It's going to be hard
for the jury to believe

21:09.335 --> 21:11.738
your brother risked
burning your wife openly

21:11.772 --> 21:13.740
without some assurance
of a pardon,

21:13.774 --> 21:15.676
particularly
when the punishment

21:15.709 --> 21:17.343
is death by hanging.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.479
Do you think I'm guilty,
Ms. Washington?

21:19.513 --> 21:20.747
My opinion doesn't matter.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.482
Yeah, well,
I'm taking a poll.

21:24.818 --> 21:27.353
You pardoned the man
that murdered your wife.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.889
Could you kill your sibling?

21:28.922 --> 21:30.657
All right, look,

21:30.691 --> 21:33.694
in your testimony,
I don't know if
it'll be enough

21:33.727 --> 21:35.696
to simply denounce the murder.

21:35.729 --> 21:38.765
You have to condemn the idea
of these honor killings,

21:38.799 --> 21:40.801
and it probably wouldn't hurt

21:40.834 --> 21:44.671
to distance yourself
from your homeland altogether.

21:44.705 --> 21:46.673
I'm an American,
Mr. Donnell,

21:46.707 --> 21:49.409
but I'm also proud
to be Pakistani.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.546
I certainly won't denounce
my native country.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.881
I'm just saying
it wouldn't hurt.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.727
I looked over
and I saw her.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.530
She was stuffing software
into her purse.

22:09.563 --> 22:11.532
You saw this woman?

22:11.565 --> 22:12.599
Yes, ma'am.

22:12.633 --> 22:14.735
And what happened next,
sir?

22:14.768 --> 22:17.470
I started to approach her.
She saw me coming.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.740
She appeared
to know I was suspicious.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.008
All of a sudden,
she just took off.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.544
-She took flight?
-Immediately.

22:23.577 --> 22:25.078
And you couldn't
catch her?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.914
Well, I inadvertently collided
with another customer,

22:27.948 --> 22:32.485
and as a result,
she eluded capture.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.887
Mr. Reddington,

22:33.920 --> 22:36.823
are you absolutely sure
this is the woman you saw

22:36.857 --> 22:38.992
stuffing software
into her purse?

22:39.025 --> 22:40.594
Absolutely.

22:40.627 --> 22:44.598
She's even wearing
the same yellow dress.

22:44.631 --> 22:48.001
She couldn't have come to court
in a different outfit?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.069
Mr. Young?

22:49.102 --> 22:51.104
Yes, your honor.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.438
You're up.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.841
Actually,
my colleague Mr. Bassett

22:54.875 --> 22:57.544
will be conducting cross.

22:57.578 --> 22:59.379
How nice.

23:01.748 --> 23:05.652
Mr. Reddington, are you certain
this is the woman you saw?

23:05.686 --> 23:08.421
-Yes, I am.
-Emma Lugar,

23:08.454 --> 23:10.423
the very woman
you picked out of a lineup?

23:10.456 --> 23:11.925
Correct.

23:11.958 --> 23:14.728
-This is that woman?
You're absolutely sure?
-Yes.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.864
-Positive?
-Objection--
asked and answered.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.199
Sustained.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.500
Nothing further.

23:20.534 --> 23:22.569
The witness
may step down.

23:22.603 --> 23:24.838
Nothing further?

23:24.871 --> 23:26.673
-It went well.
-Went well?

23:26.707 --> 23:28.842
You just got the witness
to confirm the I. D.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.144
three more times.
We represent the defendant.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.580
I realize that.

23:33.614 --> 23:36.517
Mr. Bassett, something
to share with the court?

23:36.550 --> 23:37.951
Yes, your honor.

23:37.984 --> 23:39.953
At this time, I would ask

23:39.986 --> 23:42.756
that the real Emma Lugar
please stand up.

23:45.225 --> 23:48.028
That's the woman charged
with the crime, your honor.

23:48.061 --> 23:51.965
The witness identified
this woman here,

23:51.998 --> 23:55.068
whose name is
Marjorie Hooley.

24:00.574 --> 24:05.846
I will see counsel
in chambers.

24:13.687 --> 24:16.089
Injustice demanded it.

24:16.122 --> 24:19.560
Justice demanded you commit
a fraud on the court?

24:19.593 --> 24:21.628
The lineup was tainted.
As Ms. Lugar's attorney--

24:21.662 --> 24:23.830
-Harland.
-Both of you are
in contempt.

24:23.864 --> 24:25.566
I didn't know.

24:25.599 --> 24:28.168
I told you I would
hold you accountable.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.235
You're in contempt.

24:29.269 --> 24:32.138
You have to declare
a mistrial.

24:32.172 --> 24:35.175
Double jeopardy has been
attached, Ms. Alexander.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.177
She could walk
with a mistrial.

24:37.210 --> 24:40.246
I would suggest you declare
a mistrial on shoplifting,

24:40.280 --> 24:42.248
hold the defendant
in contempt of court,

24:42.282 --> 24:44.651
as well as counsel,
and slap her hard.

24:44.685 --> 24:45.852
That's completely
unethical.

24:45.886 --> 24:47.554
Oh, you're going to
raise ethics?

24:47.588 --> 24:49.089
The defendant followed
the advice of her attorney.

24:49.122 --> 24:50.691
You can't imprison her

24:50.724 --> 24:52.092
for sitting
in the back of a courtroom.

24:52.125 --> 24:54.227
I think we should
just finish the trial

24:54.260 --> 24:56.563
and all learn
from our mistakes.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.935
This is what will happen.

25:01.968 --> 25:05.038
We will put both
of those women at your table,

25:05.071 --> 25:07.841
then allow the witness
to make another I. D.

25:07.874 --> 25:11.277
I will instruct the jury
to disregard the first one.

25:11.311 --> 25:13.614
That will be tantamount
to steering the witness,
your honor.

25:13.647 --> 25:15.882
Mr. Bassett,
the court is not interested

25:15.916 --> 25:18.919
in anything you have to say.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.854
Get those women
at your table.

25:20.887 --> 25:24.858
We will reconvene
after lunch.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.863
The contract looks fine

25:29.896 --> 25:32.633
as between you and
the biological father.

25:32.666 --> 25:34.801
-But?
-Well, you don't have
any authority

25:34.835 --> 25:36.169
to waive the child's rights.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.238
If she wants to sue
for financial support

25:38.271 --> 25:41.241
down the road, you can't
really contract against it.

25:41.274 --> 25:42.909
You didn't think of that?

25:46.012 --> 25:47.013
You got something
to say, Jimmy?

25:47.047 --> 25:48.148
-All right--
-No.

25:48.181 --> 25:49.683
What the hell
did that mean?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.251
-Ell--
-He made a remark,
Lindsay,

25:51.284 --> 25:53.787
and I'm going to
address him on that.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.789
What's your problem,
Jimmy?

25:55.822 --> 25:57.858
Okay.

25:57.891 --> 26:00.794
My problem is
this single mother thing--

26:00.827 --> 26:02.896
more times than not,

26:02.929 --> 26:05.932
I think it's
a selfish thing to do.

26:05.966 --> 26:07.601
Is that right?

26:07.634 --> 26:08.869
Yes.

26:08.902 --> 26:11.171
You're getting a child.
Good for you.

26:11.204 --> 26:12.806
As for the baby,

26:12.839 --> 26:15.241
she's getting a life
with no father.

26:15.275 --> 26:18.078
It's tough enough
growing up these days with--

26:18.111 --> 26:21.014
I'm just saying I don't think
it's any coincidence

26:21.047 --> 26:23.717
when you drew up
that contract there,

26:23.750 --> 26:26.653
you didn't once consider it
from the child's side.

26:26.687 --> 26:29.089
Well, consider this, Jimmy.

26:29.122 --> 26:30.724
Go to hell,

26:30.757 --> 26:32.826
which I know
you believe in,

26:32.859 --> 26:35.195
given the origins
of most of your beliefs.

26:35.228 --> 26:37.263
Fine. Insult me
as a Catholic.

26:37.297 --> 26:39.165
All right, this discussion
isn't necessary.

26:39.199 --> 26:41.735
No, I am insulting you
as a friend,

26:41.768 --> 26:43.770
somebody who I happen
to love

26:43.804 --> 26:46.773
and somebody who I expect
to be there for me--

26:46.807 --> 26:48.308
You know what?

26:48.341 --> 26:50.343
Forget it.

27:04.157 --> 27:07.327
I was horrified
as everybody else.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.429
You didn't know
what he planned to do.

27:09.462 --> 27:11.965
Set my wife on fire?

27:11.998 --> 27:14.234
Of course not.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.870
How did he find out
about your wife's affair?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.304
I told him.

27:18.338 --> 27:22.876
I was very hurt about it,
so I shared my--

27:22.909 --> 27:24.811
What was his reaction?

27:24.845 --> 27:27.247
He was angry, but he certainly
gave me no indication

27:27.280 --> 27:29.249
that he planned
to take her life.

27:29.282 --> 27:31.417
These honor killings--

27:31.451 --> 27:34.154
are they sanctioned
by Islamic law?

27:34.187 --> 27:36.256
No, nor are they
by Pakistani law.

27:36.289 --> 27:38.725
It's simply a custom,
an ancient one,

27:38.759 --> 27:40.727
which is
hardly ever practiced.

27:40.761 --> 27:43.363
The question becomes
your brother.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.999
Did you know
that he believed

27:46.032 --> 27:47.968
in honor killings?

27:48.001 --> 27:50.436
No. It was nothing
we ever talked about.

27:50.470 --> 27:52.072
He's an educated man.

27:52.105 --> 27:55.776
He burned your wife.

27:57.477 --> 28:01.014
Yes.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.750
And you pardoned him.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.859
Because he's my brother.

28:15.428 --> 28:19.800
I know his heart, and...

28:19.833 --> 28:24.104
if I didn't,
he would have been hanged.

28:24.137 --> 28:26.272
As much as I hate him
for what he did--

28:26.306 --> 28:27.741
as much as I--

28:27.774 --> 28:30.310
I will never
be able to forgive him,

28:30.343 --> 28:34.147
I couldn't sign
his death warrant.

28:38.919 --> 28:40.420
Your brother decides
to redeem you

28:40.453 --> 28:41.988
by burning your spouse alive.

28:42.022 --> 28:43.890
He doesn't check
with you first

28:43.924 --> 28:45.425
to say,
"Hey, do you mind?"

28:45.458 --> 28:47.260
He knew I would have
stopped him.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.494
Did he know
you'd pardon him?

28:48.529 --> 28:50.230
No.

28:50.263 --> 28:52.332
He commits murder
in front of a lot of witnesses

28:52.365 --> 28:54.267
-with no assurance
that you'd--
-That's right.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.902
Where is he now,
Mr. Sharif?

28:55.936 --> 28:57.337
He's in Pakistan.

28:57.370 --> 28:59.339
So he'll burn a woman
to preserve your honor,

28:59.372 --> 29:00.541
but he can't get on a plane

29:00.574 --> 29:02.375
and come testify
on your behalf?

29:02.408 --> 29:05.111
If he came to this country,
he'd be jailed for life.

29:05.145 --> 29:07.447
So he's letting you
take the fall.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.883
He kills the wife,
you take the rap.

29:09.916 --> 29:13.353
Getting convicted of murder--
that's not a dishonor to you?

29:13.386 --> 29:15.522
In your country,
it's not a disgrace

29:15.556 --> 29:17.423
-to be a convicted murderer?
-Objection.

29:17.457 --> 29:19.159
Overruled.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.561
How about simply
committing murder?

29:20.594 --> 29:22.262
Any dishonor in that?

29:22.295 --> 29:24.197
Your brother is even a hero
over there, isn't he?

29:24.230 --> 29:25.999
BOBBY: Objection--
what's the relevance?

29:26.032 --> 29:27.901
The relevance is
this is win/win.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.903
One brother gets rid
of a wife

29:29.936 --> 29:32.839
while the other one gets
to enjoy a hero's status.

29:32.873 --> 29:35.942
-Objection. Move to strike.
-I don't consider
my brother a hero.

29:35.976 --> 29:37.844
The objection
is sustained.

29:37.878 --> 29:40.213
Mr. Sharif,
is it your testimony

29:40.246 --> 29:42.282
that, knowing
Pakistani culture,

29:42.315 --> 29:44.284
it wasn't at all foreseeable

29:44.317 --> 29:47.287
that your brother might attempt
to kill your wife?

29:47.320 --> 29:49.322
Murder is not part
of Pakistani culture,

29:49.355 --> 29:50.557
Ms. Gamble.

29:50.591 --> 29:52.125
Wait a second.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.227
We're here today
because a man's honor

29:54.260 --> 29:56.362
has been placed
above a woman's life.

29:56.396 --> 29:58.164
It's an ancient custom.

29:58.198 --> 30:00.433
It doesn't reflect
today's practice.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.536
Mr. Sharif,
are little girls used

30:02.569 --> 30:04.571
to settle disputes
in Pakistan?

30:04.605 --> 30:08.008
Again, you're talking
about an archaic custom.

30:08.041 --> 30:09.943
Practiced by the same people

30:09.976 --> 30:11.845
that commit
these honor killings.

30:11.878 --> 30:14.380
Objection--
this is so far off track.

30:14.414 --> 30:16.382
Sustained. Keep it
about the case, Ms. Gamble.

30:16.416 --> 30:18.318
This is about the case,
your honor.

30:18.351 --> 30:20.486
He knew where
he was sending his wife

30:20.521 --> 30:22.956
and he knew
what would happen to her.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.225
-Objection.
-Sustained.

30:25.258 --> 30:28.128
Mr. Sharif, did you call
your brother from the airport

30:28.161 --> 30:30.130
the day your wife flew out?

30:30.163 --> 30:32.298
-Yes, but I was--
-And you called him again

30:32.332 --> 30:35.468
the same day your wife
was set on fire, didn't you?

30:35.501 --> 30:39.372
With respect to my trip.

30:43.243 --> 30:46.279
With respect to your trip.

30:49.215 --> 30:52.085
I have nothing further.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.673
I didn't really think it was
an illegal thing to do.

31:12.706 --> 31:14.675
Then why didn't you tell me
you planned to do it?

31:14.708 --> 31:17.077
Well, I knew it was dicey
and I didn't want

31:17.110 --> 31:19.045
-to get your hands dirty.
-Didn't want me
to get my hands dirty?

31:19.079 --> 31:20.614
My hands are
all over this, Harland.

31:20.647 --> 31:22.215
-Eugene--
-I'm here as a favor to you.

31:22.248 --> 31:23.650
You walk into my office,

31:23.684 --> 31:25.118
ask for my help,
and this is what you do?

31:25.151 --> 31:27.320
Now, you may not care
about your reputation,

31:27.353 --> 31:29.322
but I damn well care
about mine,

31:29.355 --> 31:31.424
and sitting
at the same table with you

31:31.457 --> 31:33.426
hurts my reputation.
Can you understand that?

31:33.459 --> 31:37.363
You did that to me
in there.

31:37.397 --> 31:40.967
That wasn't my intent.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.007
See this briefcase, Eugene?

31:47.040 --> 31:50.644
It's my office.

31:50.677 --> 31:53.479
I got evicted from--

31:53.514 --> 31:58.151
Hard to make a rent
when you can't get a client.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.720
And you think
acting like a buffoon

31:59.753 --> 32:00.987
will get you clients?

32:01.021 --> 32:03.223
I think if I can get
one victory

32:03.256 --> 32:06.226
and I can stop having
to advise potential clients

32:06.259 --> 32:07.961
that I've never--

32:07.994 --> 32:10.263
It was worth
risking contempt!

32:16.036 --> 32:18.639
When this case is over,

32:18.672 --> 32:21.241
don't you ever,

32:21.274 --> 32:24.945
ever come to see me again.

32:27.714 --> 32:29.415
You got that?

32:31.685 --> 32:33.620
Got it.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.538
Did I miss something?

32:51.572 --> 32:53.540
Did you?

32:53.574 --> 32:56.577
The commonwealth put no evidence
of any conversation

32:56.610 --> 32:59.279
between my client
and his brother

32:59.312 --> 33:02.382
concerning the death
of Julie McGrath--

33:02.415 --> 33:04.551
no evidence of any planning,
any aid,

33:04.585 --> 33:06.553
no evidence whatsoever

33:06.587 --> 33:09.155
that my client knew
it was going to happen.

33:09.189 --> 33:11.758
The prosecution's
entire case is,

33:11.792 --> 33:14.394
"Gee, they were brothers.
He must have known."

33:14.427 --> 33:16.362
That's it.

33:16.396 --> 33:21.501
Imaad Sharif is on trial here
only out of frustration.

33:21.535 --> 33:25.506
They can't get
the real killer.

33:25.539 --> 33:29.643
A sympathetic family
sits over there wanting justice.

33:29.676 --> 33:34.047
A frustrated district attorney
wants somebody to pay,

33:34.080 --> 33:37.083
so it's,
"Let's nail the brother."

33:39.085 --> 33:41.487
You know, usually I find myself
standing up here

33:41.522 --> 33:44.791
asking juries
to analyze the evidence...

33:44.825 --> 33:50.795
find not guilty
beyond reasonable doubt.

33:51.698 --> 33:57.270
Here, there is no evidence.

33:57.303 --> 34:00.106
None.

34:02.576 --> 34:04.611
HELEN:
You want evidence?

34:04.645 --> 34:07.413
A wife cheats on her husband.

34:07.447 --> 34:10.283
Suddenly, he plans a trip
to Pakistan.

34:10.315 --> 34:13.554
He sends her off alone.

34:13.587 --> 34:15.188
His brother kills her

34:15.221 --> 34:17.558
while he sits comfortably
in the United States

34:17.591 --> 34:19.425
with an alibi.

34:19.458 --> 34:24.831
Then,
pursuant to Pakistani law,
he grants a pardon,

34:24.864 --> 34:29.101
and his brother completely
gets away with it.

34:29.135 --> 34:34.841
Yes, it's a little
frustrating.

34:34.875 --> 34:37.578
The murderer falls back
on Pakistani law

34:37.610 --> 34:42.215
where this tribal qisas thing
can get him off,

34:42.248 --> 34:47.588
while the conspiring husband
relies on American courts

34:47.621 --> 34:52.458
and takes advantage of
our higher burdens of proof.

34:52.492 --> 34:54.860
This man comes from a society

34:54.895 --> 34:58.331
that treats women
as commodities,

34:58.364 --> 35:01.602
a nation that burns
bad wives.

35:01.635 --> 35:04.838
In America, we don't do that.

35:04.871 --> 35:07.207
We don't condone
honor killings.

35:07.240 --> 35:11.612
We don't consider any murder
to be honorable.

35:11.645 --> 35:14.615
You all know what he did.

35:14.648 --> 35:19.620
Come back with a verdict
which reminds him

35:19.653 --> 35:22.656
what country he is in now.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.234
REDDINGTON:
And as I said before,

35:34.267 --> 35:36.603
as she saw me coming,
she took off.

35:36.637 --> 35:38.238
I continued pursuit,

35:38.271 --> 35:40.607
but after colliding
with another customer,

35:40.641 --> 35:42.242
she got away.

35:42.275 --> 35:44.878
And, Mr. Reddington,
one more time,

35:44.911 --> 35:47.280
I would ask you
to identify for the court

35:47.313 --> 35:50.617
the woman you saw
in the store that day.

35:50.651 --> 35:53.319
She's sitting right there
in the blue dress.

35:54.688 --> 35:58.892
Mr. Reddington, I'd like
you to look closely.

35:58.925 --> 36:01.728
Are you sure the woman
in the blue dress is the one?

36:01.762 --> 36:02.929
Absolutely.

36:02.963 --> 36:05.732
Sir, one more time.

36:05.766 --> 36:06.933
Objection.

36:06.967 --> 36:08.735
That's her in the blue dress.

36:08.769 --> 36:10.470
Are you sure
it wasn't me?

36:11.838 --> 36:16.476
I'm directing a verdict
of not guilty.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.779
Ms. Lugar,
you are free to go,

36:18.812 --> 36:20.747
as are you,
Ms. Blue dress.

36:20.781 --> 36:22.348
I don't even know
your name.

36:22.382 --> 36:24.918
Bailiff, take Mr. Bassett
into custody.

36:24.951 --> 36:28.522
Mr. Bassett, I sentence you
to 15 days in lockup

36:28.555 --> 36:29.923
for contempt of court,

36:29.956 --> 36:31.558
sentence to begin
immediately.

36:31.592 --> 36:34.260
(bangs gavel)

36:34.294 --> 36:35.629
We won.

36:35.662 --> 36:37.263
Yes, we did.

36:37.297 --> 36:38.632
This counts.

36:38.665 --> 36:40.934
It's a jury trial.

36:40.967 --> 36:43.303
It counts.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.908
Thank you, Eugene.

36:49.610 --> 36:51.344
Sure.

37:16.503 --> 37:19.640
The truth is,
I do have a problem

37:19.673 --> 37:24.645
with the single mother thing
as an ideal, like I said.

37:24.678 --> 37:29.015
The truth is I do
consider us like family,

37:29.049 --> 37:32.686
and family members
judge each other all the time.

37:32.719 --> 37:35.756
We're always
in each other's business.

37:35.789 --> 37:38.491
I took the liberty
of butting into yours

37:38.525 --> 37:42.495
because I do care
about you, Ellenor.

37:42.529 --> 37:46.032
You're like a sister to me,

37:46.066 --> 37:50.036
and while I may have doubts
about what you're doing,

37:50.070 --> 37:52.338
there should be no doubt

37:52.372 --> 37:57.343
that I will be there for you
every step,

37:57.377 --> 38:00.514
whatever you need.

38:00.547 --> 38:04.785
I know that, Jimmy,

38:04.818 --> 38:07.287
and I appreciate that.

38:09.923 --> 38:12.626
I wish you could see

38:12.659 --> 38:16.362
what I need right now

38:16.396 --> 38:19.399
is for you
to share in my joy.

38:43.857 --> 38:46.593
KITTELSON:
Mr. Sharif, please rise.

38:48.028 --> 38:50.531
Has the jury reached
a verdict?

38:50.564 --> 38:52.633
We have, your honor.

38:52.666 --> 38:54.100
What say you?

38:54.134 --> 38:57.370
Commonwealth
vs. Imaad Sharif,

38:57.403 --> 38:58.905
count one on the charge

38:58.939 --> 39:01.074
of accessory before the fact
to murder--

39:01.107 --> 39:03.977
we find the defendant
Imaad Sharif...

39:04.010 --> 39:05.846
guilty.

39:05.879 --> 39:08.749
Count two, on the charge

39:08.782 --> 39:10.584
of conspiracy
to commit murder,

39:10.617 --> 39:13.486
we find the defendant
Imaad Sharif...

39:13.520 --> 39:15.488
guilty.

39:21.862 --> 39:24.464
Ask the court enter
findings of not guilty

39:24.497 --> 39:26.667
of both counts,
notwithstanding the verdict.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.935
Denied. Security, take
the defendant into custody.

39:28.969 --> 39:32.105
We'll schedule sentencing
later.

39:32.138 --> 39:34.575
Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

39:34.608 --> 39:36.543
We are adjourned.

39:47.888 --> 39:50.857
I need a second.

39:50.891 --> 39:52.859
Ex parte, counsel.

39:52.893 --> 39:55.428
Oh, we're suddenly
going to exalt the law?

39:55.461 --> 39:56.963
It would be
a big mistake

39:56.997 --> 40:00.601
for you to come in here
and insult me.

40:00.634 --> 40:03.136
Well, this seems to be
the day for big mistakes.

40:03.169 --> 40:04.871
There was no basis
for that verdict,

40:04.905 --> 40:06.072
and you know it.
It was totally--

40:06.106 --> 40:08.575
You're going to tell me
what I know?

40:08.609 --> 40:10.210
Let me tell you
what I know.

40:10.243 --> 40:13.213
I've always known you to be
a judge who's about the law,

40:13.246 --> 40:15.849
despite all the wacky stuff
you got going on.

40:15.882 --> 40:17.718
When you put that robe on,
you've always been a judge--

40:17.751 --> 40:20.086
a good one, a fair one.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.221
You pride yourself on that.

40:21.254 --> 40:23.123
Where the hell was
your pride today?

40:23.156 --> 40:25.491
The district attorney
delivered

40:25.526 --> 40:27.861
one of the most bigoted
closings I've ever seen,

40:27.894 --> 40:29.596
and you didn't blink.

40:29.630 --> 40:31.865
The prejudice in this trial
has been screaming!

40:31.898 --> 40:33.499
And the loudest scream

40:33.534 --> 40:35.501
came in the form
of that verdict.

40:35.536 --> 40:38.772
How in God's name
can you let it stand?

40:38.805 --> 40:43.510
For the record, counsel,
what you call bigotry

40:43.544 --> 40:45.512
the district attorney
calls motive,

40:45.546 --> 40:47.948
and she is free
to argue that.

40:47.981 --> 40:50.717
Second,
circumstantial evidence

40:50.751 --> 40:52.953
is enough to convict,

40:52.986 --> 40:56.690
and this jury found
that evidence to be compelling.

40:56.723 --> 41:01.795
It is not my function
to substitute my judgment.

41:01.828 --> 41:05.231
And lastly,
off the record,

41:05.265 --> 41:10.537
any man whose brother
burns women alive--

41:10.571 --> 41:12.539
he can't be all good.

41:12.573 --> 41:15.241
Now please leave.

41:15.275 --> 41:18.979
Wow.

41:19.012 --> 41:20.547
I guess prejudice

41:20.581 --> 41:25.218
is cloaked in black robes
sometimes, too.

41:25.251 --> 41:27.220
I asked you to leave,

41:27.253 --> 41:31.925
and you would be wise
to do so now.

41:37.263 --> 41:39.633
(door slams)

41:48.642 --> 41:50.043
Hey, Eugene.

41:50.076 --> 41:51.645
Hey.

41:54.648 --> 41:56.049
You doing okay?

41:56.082 --> 41:58.619
Oh, sure.

41:58.652 --> 42:01.054
They took away my tie,
my shoelaces,

42:01.087 --> 42:03.624
like I'm going to
hang myself or something.

42:03.657 --> 42:05.058
Believe that?

42:05.091 --> 42:07.060
On this day,
coming off a victory?

42:07.093 --> 42:08.595
Yeah, right.

42:08.629 --> 42:13.266
It was a victory.
You realize that?

42:13.299 --> 42:15.301
Oh, of course I do.

42:18.138 --> 42:20.841
I want to apologize
for humiliating you.

42:20.874 --> 42:23.109
I never meant to.

42:23.143 --> 42:26.012
Ahh, I know.

42:26.046 --> 42:28.582
The insurance company

42:28.615 --> 42:30.951
has to lift
that mandate now.

42:30.984 --> 42:33.954
No more having to warn clients
you've never won.

42:33.987 --> 42:35.589
Yeah.

42:35.622 --> 42:37.357
It's a start.

42:37.390 --> 42:39.960
You take the victory,
you enjoy it,

42:39.993 --> 42:42.663
then you build on it.

42:42.696 --> 42:44.030
Oh, I will.

42:44.064 --> 42:47.133
I'm just sitting here
savoring the moment.

42:47.167 --> 42:51.872
Nobody has to be
worrying about me anymore.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.207
Good.

42:54.240 --> 42:57.711
Thanks, Eugene.

42:57.744 --> 43:00.213
Sure thing.

43:00.246 --> 43:01.982
Night, Harland.

43:02.015 --> 43:04.017
Night.

43:32.979 --> 43:35.348
â™ª (theme)

43:58.772 --> 44:00.340
You stinker!
