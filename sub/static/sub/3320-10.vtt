00:02.872 --> 00:04.961
[Christy crying]

00:09.705 --> 00:11.272
[crying continues]

00:16.059 --> 00:17.974
[Christy crying louder]

00:20.063 --> 00:21.325
[groans, splutters]

00:21.412 --> 00:22.935
I gotta pee, anyway.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.639
So...

00:30.726 --> 00:32.075
how'’s it going?

00:33.946 --> 00:36.819
Sorry, I didn'’t mean
to wake you.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.951
Yeah, you did.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.998
What'’s going on?

00:42.085 --> 00:44.392
What'’s going on is--

00:44.479 --> 00:47.177
the Mitchells have been married
for ten years.

00:47.264 --> 00:51.834
All right, you'’re gonna have to
connect the dots a little more.

00:51.921 --> 00:55.533
I waited on the Mitchells
when they first got married,

00:55.620 --> 00:58.188
and they come back every year
for their anniversary.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.885
And tonight...

00:59.972 --> 01:03.454
was their tenth anniversary.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.065
You know what that means?

01:05.152 --> 01:08.068
Need more dots.

01:08.155 --> 01:11.897
I have been at that stupid
restaurant for ten years.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.856
Oh, well, then happy anniversary
to you, too.

01:16.293 --> 01:18.861
Waitressing was just supposed
to be a temporary thing

01:18.948 --> 01:21.516
till I figured out what I wanted
to do with my life.

01:21.603 --> 01:23.996
Same thing happened when
I sold knock-off handbags

01:24.084 --> 01:25.694
at the flea market.

01:25.781 --> 01:27.565
I thought-- I'’ll do
this for a few months

01:27.652 --> 01:29.089
to pay back my bail bondsman.

01:29.176 --> 01:30.568
Next thing I knew,
I had 300 teenagers

01:30.655 --> 01:32.701
working for me in China.

01:34.529 --> 01:35.921
I wanted a career.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.227
Not just a job.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.229
What about going
back to school?

01:39.316 --> 01:42.232
[sighs] I'’d have
to get my GED first.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.668
You never graduated
high school?

01:43.755 --> 01:44.669
No.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.410
Huh.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.195
That doesn'’t reflect
well on me, does it?

01:50.153 --> 01:52.634
Okay, no problem.
Take the test, get your GED.

01:52.721 --> 01:55.115
What kind of career am I gonna
have with a high school diploma?

01:55.202 --> 01:56.855
Fine, then your next step
is going to college.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.596
Oh, yeah, right. With all
the extra money we have,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.032
I can go to college.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.469
You can apply
for scholarships...

02:01.556 --> 02:02.948
Will you stop trying
to fix the problem

02:03.035 --> 02:04.036
and just listen to my feelings?!

02:05.647 --> 02:07.170
Now I know
why men hate us.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.307
Are we almost done here?

02:13.394 --> 02:14.612
I have to pee.

02:33.936 --> 02:35.590
Anyway, she'’s just afraid
she'’s gonna be a waitress

02:35.677 --> 02:37.722
who lives with her mother
for the rest of her life.

02:37.809 --> 02:39.724
Come on, that'’s not
gonna happen.Damn right, it'’s not.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.639
You'’re gonna have to
take her at some point.

02:41.726 --> 02:42.771
Thank you.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.555
[sighs]

02:44.642 --> 02:46.818
How about we get some
ice cream, go see a movie?

02:46.905 --> 02:48.516
I don'’t know.
It'’s pretty late.

02:48.603 --> 02:51.040
It'’s 8:15, Alvin.

02:51.127 --> 02:54.348
Like I said,
it'’s pretty late.

02:54.435 --> 02:55.479
Come on!

02:55.566 --> 02:57.307
What happened to you?

02:57.394 --> 02:59.222
When we were kids, we wouldn'’t
even start the night

02:59.309 --> 03:00.571
till 11:00, 12:00.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.094
Yes, well, we were young,

03:02.182 --> 03:05.707
full of life and hope
and cocaine.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.578
I'’ll order you a
double espresso.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.189
Yeah, but then I'’ll be
up all night.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.060
So? We can fool around
when we get home.

03:11.147 --> 03:14.716
You want to go
to a late movie andhave sex?

03:14.803 --> 03:16.021
What, am I Superman?

03:17.762 --> 03:18.894
Forget it.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.374
We can still stop
for ice cream.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.419
I just need to swing
by the Rite Aid

03:22.506 --> 03:24.943
and pick up something to help me
process the dairy.

03:25.030 --> 03:27.032
While you'’re in there,

03:27.119 --> 03:30.035
get me a couple of D batteries
and a men'’s fitness magazine.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.998
Hi, I'’m Steve,
I'’m an alcoholic.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.695
ALL: Hi, Steve.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.698
I'’ve been sober nine months
and 16 days.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.658
[laughing]: I know, right?

03:43.745 --> 03:45.312
Miracle!

03:46.835 --> 03:48.402
Anyway, I'’m feeling pretty good.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.795
Uh, the California
Bar Association

03:50.882 --> 03:53.537
has reluctantly agreed
to let me practice law again.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.237
Got a couple of new clients,

03:57.324 --> 04:00.457
and a pretty cool desk
I found behind a church.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.329
So, all in all,
things are looking up.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.808
Oh, and I...

04:03.895 --> 04:05.375
I don'’t know
if this is appropriate,

04:05.462 --> 04:07.421
but, uh... what the hell?

04:07.508 --> 04:09.727
If anyone here'’s
going through a divorce,

04:09.814 --> 04:11.860
or has slipped and fell
in a large chain store,

04:11.947 --> 04:13.818
I'’ll be over by the cookies
after the meeting.

04:13.905 --> 04:14.993
Thanks.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.043
WOMAN: Okay, that'’s all the time
we have for sharing today...

04:21.130 --> 04:22.479
I liked your share.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.568
Oh, thanks.

04:24.655 --> 04:28.746
Listen, I'’ve been thinking about
making some changes in my life.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.096
Is there any chance I
could talk to you sometime

04:31.183 --> 04:32.707
about how you
became a lawyer?

04:32.794 --> 04:34.099
Sure.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.927
Want to grab
a coffee after?

04:36.014 --> 04:37.277
That'’d be great.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.278
My treat.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.757
No, no, no, no,
I got it.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.155
I guess... ever since
I was a kid,

04:46.242 --> 04:49.158
I felt that it was so unfair how
some people got treated worse

04:49.245 --> 04:50.986
just '’cause they
didn'’t have money.

04:51.073 --> 04:54.685
And I always wanted to do
something about it, you know?

04:54.772 --> 04:57.993
Be the kind of lawyer who
helps them get a fair shake.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.603
You know what we call
lawyers like that?

04:59.690 --> 05:02.171
Poor.

05:02.258 --> 05:06.131
All right, well, then
I'’ve got that part down.

05:06.218 --> 05:09.265
My main worry is--
am I too late?

05:09.352 --> 05:11.572
Is it crazy for me to
try this at my age?

05:11.659 --> 05:12.877
Not at all.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.314
You'’re smart, you'’re motivated,

05:14.401 --> 05:17.621
and a guy could just drown
in those eyes.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.188
Excuse me?

05:19.275 --> 05:21.538
So where'’d you go
to college?

05:21.625 --> 05:24.541
Um, I haven'’t exactly
done that, yet.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.413
High school?
I never finished.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.633
I was a little too "high"
for the "school" part.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.682
It'’s actually one of
my biggest regrets.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.684
Uh-huh.

05:36.771 --> 05:37.946
Steve?

05:38.033 --> 05:39.904
Right here.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.650
Yeah, so listen, I know
that I have to get my GED

05:46.737 --> 05:48.739
and get my college degree...

05:48.826 --> 05:51.002
Right, and then you'’re looking
at three years of law school.

05:51.089 --> 05:52.874
So, seven years, bam,
you'’re a lawyer.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.050
I'’m a working single mom.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.704
I couldn'’t go
to school full-time.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.707
So, ten years, bam,
you'’re a lawyer.

05:59.794 --> 06:01.404
Oh, my God.

06:01.491 --> 06:03.580
The Mitchells will have been
married 20 years.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.147
The Mitchells?

06:05.234 --> 06:06.844
Oh, they'’re this
nice couple I wait on

06:06.931 --> 06:07.932
at my restaurant.

06:08.019 --> 06:09.456
Well, if you stick with it,

06:09.543 --> 06:10.761
maybe, when their marriage
falls apart,

06:10.848 --> 06:12.763
you can handle
their divorce.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.766
I'’d like that.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.334
Goes without saying
you want to represent the wife.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.205
Sure!

06:20.292 --> 06:22.033
Well, if you want
some on-the-job training,

06:22.120 --> 06:24.514
why don'’t you come to my office
a couple hours a week

06:24.601 --> 06:25.907
and give me a hand?

06:25.994 --> 06:28.431
Oh, that'’d be great.
Thank you.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.694
Let me get this.
[laughing]:
Don'’t be ridiculous.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.218
This is on the house.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.437
Waiter, got
a problem here!

06:37.571 --> 06:40.530
Okay, when I click enter,

06:40.617 --> 06:44.142
I will be officially signed up
to take my GED test.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.623
My first step
to becoming a lawyer

06:46.710 --> 06:49.409
and changing
my life forever.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.934
What are you
waiting for?

06:53.021 --> 06:54.936
To be honest,
I'’m a little scared.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.764
Want me to do it
for you?
No!

06:56.851 --> 06:58.461
This is my
button to click.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.768
This is the first step
on myjourney.

07:00.855 --> 07:03.335
No one can take it
for me.

07:04.685 --> 07:05.947
Hey!

07:06.034 --> 07:08.079
I really want to
play Minecraft.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.604
[doorbell rings]

07:10.691 --> 07:11.561
BONNIE:
I got it!

07:14.216 --> 07:15.173
Hey!

07:15.260 --> 07:16.827
This is a nice
surprise.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.176
What'’s up?

07:18.263 --> 07:19.656
You got me thinking
the other night

07:19.743 --> 07:21.789
about how we don'’t party
like we used to,

07:21.876 --> 07:23.834
and I thought maybe
I could do something about it.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.749
Like what?Like tomorrow night,

07:25.836 --> 07:28.056
you and I have tickets
to see your favorite band

07:28.143 --> 07:29.274
from the '’70s.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.667
The Rolling...Aerosmith!

07:30.754 --> 07:32.539
Aerosmith!

07:32.626 --> 07:36.238
Oh, my God, Alvin,
this is amazing.

07:36.325 --> 07:40.285
Do you realize I haven'’t been
to a rock concert sober since...

07:40.372 --> 07:43.027
Uh, you know, I'’m gonna
have to go with never.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.205
Here we are.

07:47.292 --> 07:49.643
As you can see, I'’m not real
good at organizing my files.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.211
Yeah.

07:53.298 --> 07:54.778
How'’d you get
through law school?

07:54.865 --> 07:57.738
Methamphetamines
and an Asian roommate.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.915
Work late a lot?

08:01.002 --> 08:02.612
Uh, that and I kind of
live here.

08:04.440 --> 08:07.791
So, anyway, if you could
put all this...

08:07.878 --> 08:10.838
away...

08:10.925 --> 08:14.537
so that I could find it again,
that would be awesome.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.452
You got it.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.454
[stutters]
Hang on a sec.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.023
Just got to...

08:22.110 --> 08:24.329
clear out these dead soldiers.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.509
Thank you for your service,
fellas.

08:31.206 --> 08:34.251
Do you want me to file
these alphabetically?

08:34.339 --> 08:35.950
By date? Type of case?

08:36.037 --> 08:37.342
Yes.

08:41.085 --> 08:42.347
Uh...

08:44.131 --> 08:47.091
"Roxy versus
Nudes Nudes Nudes."

08:47.178 --> 08:48.179
What'’s this?

08:48.266 --> 08:50.051
Uh, oh, that, uh...

08:50.138 --> 08:54.055
Roxy, not her real name, is,
uh, suing Nudes Nudes Nudes,

08:54.142 --> 08:55.622
a gentlemen'’s club
by the airport

08:55.709 --> 08:57.188
with surprisingly
good chicken wings.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.671
Yeah, yeah, but what'’s
the suit about?

09:01.758 --> 09:03.455
Uh, if I recall correctly,

09:03.543 --> 09:06.197
it is Roxy'’s contention--
my word not hers--

09:06.284 --> 09:10.245
that Nudes Nudes Nudes is
paying her below minimum wage

09:10.332 --> 09:13.596
by incorrectly claiming that she
is an independent contractor.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.945
Oh.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.773
Interesting.

09:16.860 --> 09:20.385
Does a place like that tell her
what hours she has to work?

09:20.472 --> 09:22.213
[scoffing]: Yes, in fact,
she was very disappointed

09:22.300 --> 09:24.172
to be working breakfast.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.434
Okay.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.610
Do they tell her what to wear?

09:27.697 --> 09:31.353
It'’s called "Nudes Nudes Nudes,"
not "Pants Pants Pants."

09:33.529 --> 09:36.445
And, uh, when she does
a lap dance,

09:36.532 --> 09:38.229
do they tell her
what she can charge?

09:38.316 --> 09:39.230
Yeah.

09:39.317 --> 09:41.102
I'’m guessing.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.714
She sounds like
a regular employee to me.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.411
Yeah, she does,
doesn'’t she?

09:46.498 --> 09:48.457
Let me see that.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.459
Hadn'’t actually read this, yet.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.069
I was just looking
at the pictures.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.552
I gotta tell you,

09:56.639 --> 09:58.902
you ask smart questions,
Christy.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.251
Thanks.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.775
Yeah, I mean,
it may take a while,

10:01.862 --> 10:03.385
but I don'’t see any reason

10:03.472 --> 10:04.778
why you couldn'’t be
a lawyer someday.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.128
Oh... Steve...

10:07.215 --> 10:10.435
that is exactly the kind
of encouragement I need.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.483
Hey.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.267
Yeah, hey, back off.

10:19.531 --> 10:20.794
What was I thinking?

10:20.881 --> 10:22.447
[sighs]
Christy, wait.

10:22.534 --> 10:24.449
[sighs]
Jerk.

10:33.415 --> 10:34.329
Hey.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.635
Hey.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.727
Listen, uh, my
schedule opened up,

10:40.814 --> 10:43.251
so you don'’t have to
watch Roscoe on Saturday.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.861
What about your
GED thing?

10:44.948 --> 10:46.907
Yeah, I'’m not
gonna do that.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.692
Yes, I just won 20 bucks
from Grandma.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.305
You bet that I wouldn'’t
take the test?

10:54.392 --> 10:55.480
Why would you do that?

10:55.567 --> 10:56.786
Oh, come on, Mom.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.222
You always say
you'’re gonna do stuff,

10:58.309 --> 10:59.310
and then you don'’t.

10:59.397 --> 11:01.051
That'’s not true.

11:01.138 --> 11:02.618
Name one thing.

11:02.705 --> 11:04.533
Except for the blog
I was gonna start,

11:04.620 --> 11:06.578
my line of sober greeting cards
and that six-day cleanse.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.145
Come on, name one.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.670
What happened to
becoming a lawyer?

11:12.497 --> 11:13.890
It was a stupid dream.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.283
I can'’t do it.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.415
That weirdo Steve said
you could.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.461
He didn'’t mean it.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.463
He just wanted
to date me.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.943
And I'’m only using
the word "date"

11:23.030 --> 11:24.248
because you'’re
my daughter.

11:26.816 --> 11:27.817
What do you expect?

11:27.904 --> 11:28.905
Men suck.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.475
Sweetie, you'’re too young
to be that cynical.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.477
There are lots of
wonderful men...

11:35.564 --> 11:37.435
Oh, God, I can'’t
even fake it.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.313
Well, I think
you'’re being a chicken.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.967
And I only use
the word "chicken"

11:47.054 --> 11:48.272
because you'’re my mother.

11:52.407 --> 11:55.105
Look, it'’s over.

11:55.192 --> 11:58.761
You said it yourself--
I quit things.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.763
It'’s how I roll.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.722
Mom, wait.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.812
I shouldn'’t have said that.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.291
You don'’t quit everything.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.468
You stayed sober.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.993
You know,

12:13.080 --> 12:15.038
Violet, when you open
your heart to me...

12:15.125 --> 12:17.432
Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no,
too much. I'’m done, good-bye!

12:20.870 --> 12:22.742
[low, indistinct chatter]

12:26.963 --> 12:27.877
Are you seeing
what I'’m seeing?

12:27.964 --> 12:28.878
What?

12:28.965 --> 12:30.271
Alvin,

12:30.358 --> 12:33.013
we'’re the youngest
people here.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.015
No.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.800
Wait, let me take a look.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.544
Wow, we are.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.851
That woman over
there is knitting.

12:44.938 --> 12:46.374
Oh, God.

12:46.461 --> 12:47.723
I am so depressed.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.377
No, no, no--
200 bucks a ticket.

12:49.464 --> 12:51.031
No one'’s depressed.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.382
Besides, there are
young people here.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.123
Look at the guys
at the front of the stage.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.907
That'’s security.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.431
Really? Who here'’s
gonna rush that stage?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.479
Maybe they'’re there to catch
the band if they fall.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.699
You want a hit?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.658
Can'’t. Sober.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.660
Have to. Cancer.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.060
[sighs, sputters]

13:20.147 --> 13:21.235
You okay?

13:21.322 --> 13:23.193
Yeah. I guess.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.242
Why do I feel like I'’ve
done something wrong

13:28.329 --> 13:30.244
when I haven'’t done
anything wrong?

13:30.331 --> 13:33.029
Have I done something wrong?

13:33.116 --> 13:36.076
No, forget it.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.382
Bonnie, everyone gets old.

13:38.469 --> 13:41.211
You saw Steven Tyler.
Dude looks like a raisin.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.126
[chuckles]

13:43.213 --> 13:45.955
It'’s not just about growing old.
It'’s that...

13:46.042 --> 13:48.218
we didn'’t get
to do it together.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.352
We lost so many years.

13:56.792 --> 13:57.793
[shuts engine off]

13:57.880 --> 14:00.491
Okay. How '’bout this?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.276
We forget about
what we don'’t have

14:02.363 --> 14:04.234
and we focus on
what we do have.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.540
What do we have?

14:05.627 --> 14:07.411
The future.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.110
I'’d like to spend the
rest of my life with you.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.938
You would?I would.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.722
I love you.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.421
I love you, too.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.993
Mmm.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.603
Now what do you say
we hop in the backseat

14:25.690 --> 14:26.822
and see what happens?

14:26.909 --> 14:28.824
Really?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.609
You want to feel young,
you got to act young.

14:31.696 --> 14:32.610
[chuckles]

14:32.697 --> 14:34.134
Let'’s do it.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.439
Yeah?
Okay.
Yeah.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.789
[chuckles]

14:37.877 --> 14:39.748
All right.
Here we go.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.231
You know what?
Yeah.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.189
Let'’s just use the doors.Thank you.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.721
Oh. Evening, Officer.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.506
What'’s going on in here?

14:58.593 --> 15:00.247
What'’s it look like?

15:00.334 --> 15:03.163
We just came from a concert;
feeling a little romantic.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.817
Really? Don'’t you think
you'’re a little old for this?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.428
Who you calling old?

15:07.515 --> 15:08.820
It'’s fine, Bonnie.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.474
Thanks, Officer.
We'’ll be on our way.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.434
What a douche!

15:13.521 --> 15:15.479
Excuse me?

15:15.566 --> 15:17.003
You heard me.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.135
One more word
and the cuffs come out.

15:21.094 --> 15:23.661
That'’s better.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.489
Word!

15:27.317 --> 15:29.189
[rapid knocking]

15:37.937 --> 15:40.809
Oh, God, are you suing me?

15:42.376 --> 15:44.334
No.

15:44.421 --> 15:46.597
Now, listen,
I gave it some thought,

15:46.684 --> 15:49.339
and I decided that I don'’t
need you to believe in me.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.645
I believe in me.

15:50.732 --> 15:52.212
I dobelieve in you.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.388
No, you just want
to get in my pants.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.912
Not "just"-- "in addition to."

15:56.999 --> 15:59.697
Yeah. Whatever.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.917
Now here'’s how it'’s gonna go:

16:02.004 --> 16:04.441
I am coming back
to work for you,

16:04.528 --> 16:06.313
and I am gonna learn my ass off.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.880
And you are gonna leave
said ass alone.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.360
And...

16:10.447 --> 16:12.406
I feel like I need
to say one more thing,

16:12.493 --> 16:13.929
so...

16:14.016 --> 16:17.193
that painting is
very disturbing!

16:19.935 --> 16:21.545
Are you done?

16:21.632 --> 16:23.547
Um... yes.

16:23.634 --> 16:26.724
I rest my case.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.248
I'’m really sorry.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.293
It won'’t happen again.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.425
Good.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.122
And just so you know,

16:33.209 --> 16:35.081
I called the lawyer
for Nudes Nudes Nudes,

16:35.168 --> 16:37.300
and I laid out your argument.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.867
You did?Yeah.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.564
And they want to settle.

16:40.651 --> 16:43.611
They'’re gonna give Roxy
12 grand in back pay,

16:43.698 --> 16:45.265
which will probably go
straight up her nose,

16:45.352 --> 16:47.919
but the fact is we won.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.747
"We"?

16:49.834 --> 16:52.968
Yeah. You and me.
We'’re a team.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.622
I mean,
only one of us gets paid,

16:54.709 --> 16:57.320
seeing as you'’re an independent
contractor, but...

16:57.407 --> 16:59.540
I don'’t care! That'’s great!

16:59.627 --> 17:01.803
We won our first case!

17:01.890 --> 17:04.153
Oh, God, I want to hug you,

17:04.240 --> 17:05.981
but I'’m afraid
you'’ll take it the wrong way.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.287
It'’s okay. I can handle it.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.288
[chuckles]

17:08.375 --> 17:09.550
Nope, can'’t handle it.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.334
Who cares...

17:11.421 --> 17:13.336
[phone ringing]

17:13.423 --> 17:16.078
Uh, hang on.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.428
Hey, Mom.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.604
What do you mean you'’re in jail?

17:22.214 --> 17:24.042
Why didn'’t you get a motel room?

17:25.827 --> 17:28.002
All right, all right, all right,
I'’m on my way.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.831
[sighs]
Put some clothes on.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.789
We got our second case.

17:31.876 --> 17:34.357
And I'’ll save us some time--
she'’s guilty.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.499
I am so disappointed
in the two of you.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.196
I mean, what
were you thinking?

17:47.283 --> 17:48.850
He'’s the one
who parked the car.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.721
She'’s the one
that mouthed off to the cop...

17:50.808 --> 17:51.983
I don'’t want to hear it.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.898
I am working two jobs

17:53.985 --> 17:57.076
and I have to drop everything
to come bail you out of jail?

17:57.163 --> 17:58.860
[sighs] I should'’ve
left you there,

17:58.947 --> 18:01.210
so you could think
about what you did.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.473
[quietly]:
Feel young now?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.432
[quietly]:
Yeah, this is pretty awesome.

18:07.956 --> 18:09.088
Oh...

18:09.175 --> 18:10.785
so now you'’re kissing?

18:10.872 --> 18:14.441
Do I need to
separate you two?

18:14.528 --> 18:16.834
Mom, come sit
up here with me.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.923
Now!

18:19.010 --> 18:21.622
Don'’t make me pull
this car over!
