WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:02.712
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:02.796 --> 00:05.590
I'm here because a video
was released last night,

00:05.674 --> 00:07.676
which viciously slandered
my dead son.

00:07.759 --> 00:10.387
You will be prosecuted,
because in my government,

00:10.470 --> 00:13.682
truth will have a value,
and you will have no place.

00:13.765 --> 00:15.850
People hate you,
Madam President-elect.

00:15.934 --> 00:17.352
No one's faking that.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.020
Boy, are they angry.

00:19.104 --> 00:22.899
Don't go to war with your own
national security establishment.

00:22.982 --> 00:24.567
It's a war you won't win.

00:24.651 --> 00:25.735
Keane's on the ropes.

00:25.819 --> 00:27.445
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

00:27.529 --> 00:29.614
I'm not doing one thing, Dar.

00:29.698 --> 00:33.493
Suddenly, there's a brand-new
team under McClendon's command,

00:33.576 --> 00:35.787
charged with protecting
the president-elect?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.288
All units,
target heading up the ramp.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.998
You're cleared hot to engage.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.461
Fire! Fire!

00:47.257 --> 00:49.884
Okay, she survived
an assassination attempt.

00:49.968 --> 00:51.052
I get that.

00:51.136 --> 00:54.264
We are not headed
for a Constitutional crisis.

00:54.347 --> 00:59.227
What we're headed for
is civil war.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.353
Doesn't she have
a right to know

01:00.437 --> 01:02.605
how deep and wide
this conspiracy went?

01:02.689 --> 01:05.734
I won't lie to you. There are
reforms coming down the pike,

01:05.817 --> 01:10.363
but no purges or loyalty oaths
or one-way tickets to the Gulag.

01:10.447 --> 01:12.615
You have my personal assurance
on that.

01:12.699 --> 01:14.743
- You gettin' this?
<i>- You are under arrest.</i>

01:14.826 --> 01:16.828
Open the door and step out.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.082
Everybody detained today was
connected to the conspiracy.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.251
"Detained"? Why do you keep
saying detained?

01:23.334 --> 01:24.961
They were arrested,

01:25.044 --> 01:26.504
and without legal authority,
as far as I can tell.

01:26.588 --> 01:28.673
Well, point of fact,
we have two memoranda

01:28.757 --> 01:30.133
from the Justice Department
right here.

01:30.216 --> 01:33.887
David, you sent me out there
to personally assure people

01:33.970 --> 01:35.513
this would never happen.

01:35.597 --> 01:36.931
- You-You used me.
- Yes, we did.

01:37.015 --> 01:39.267
Madam President, I need to talk
to you. It's important.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.894
Can you hear me?

01:40.977 --> 01:43.688
Innocent people are being
arrested in your name!

01:43.772 --> 01:45.315
You have to stop it! Please!

01:45.398 --> 01:48.151
Do not let them do this.
You cannot let them do this!

01:48.234 --> 01:49.944
Madam President!

03:01.558 --> 03:04.310
<i>The Justice Department
announced charges today</i>

03:04.394 --> 03:07.188
<i>against Jonathan Cleary,
a reporter for the</i> Post.

03:07.272 --> 03:09.899
<i>Cleary is accused of publishing
classified information</i>

03:09.983 --> 03:11.276
<i>about the investigation into</i>

03:11.359 --> 03:13.695
<i>jailed State department
official Virginia Sutter.</i>

03:13.778 --> 03:16.072
<i>Sutter is one of the more than
200 individuals</i>

03:16.155 --> 03:18.783
<i>detained in a probe surrounding
the attack on President Keane</i>

03:18.867 --> 03:21.536
<i>nine days before
her inauguration.</i>

03:23.788 --> 03:25.915
Eggs are hot.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.542
You don't have
to do this every day.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.544
- No, I like to.
- Hmm.

03:29.627 --> 03:31.754
What else would she do?
It's not like she has a job.

03:31.838 --> 03:33.089
Jos.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.674
She was fired by a regime
that jails free thinkers.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.175
- There's turkey bacon.
- Like Stalin.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.929
- Okay.
- I didn't start it.

03:40.013 --> 03:43.266
Her school's taking them on
another Free the 200 March.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.934
Hey, you should come.

03:45.018 --> 03:46.811
Why not?

03:46.895 --> 03:48.438
What do you think's gonna happen

03:48.521 --> 03:49.856
when I tell
the Treasury Secretary

03:49.939 --> 03:52.859
I'm ditching work so I can
go to anti-administration march?

03:52.942 --> 03:54.527
Maybe he'll respect you

03:54.611 --> 03:57.071
for giving a crap about
the Constitution.

03:57.155 --> 03:58.072
Like you have a backbone.

03:58.156 --> 03:59.365
- Josie.
- Don't say that.

03:59.449 --> 04:01.451
Can I get through breakfast
before we start in

04:01.534 --> 04:03.578
on how I'm
a silent accomplice?

04:03.661 --> 04:05.038
We should've stayed in Rome.

04:05.121 --> 04:07.040
Teo says he's embarrassed
to tell people

04:07.123 --> 04:08.207
he has
an American girlfriend.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.628
Teo should get
an Italian girl his own age.

04:16.883 --> 04:19.177
Frannycake,
you ready to rumble?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.054
- Yep.
- Let's do it.

04:21.137 --> 04:22.055
Here we go.

04:22.138 --> 04:24.182
Bup bup bup.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.850
Hands.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.396
- Have fun today, yes?
- Yes.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.315
Love you. Mwah.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.901
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.612
Bye. Okay, let's go!

04:39.906 --> 04:43.409
At least she hates him
more than she hates me.

04:43.493 --> 04:44.744
It would help

04:44.827 --> 04:46.788
if you stopped calling Keane
a fascist.

04:46.871 --> 04:48.039
She is a fascist.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.832
Saul Berenson
is still in jail.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.877
Yeah. It's bad. I know.

04:52.961 --> 04:56.464
- We're all upset, but...
- What?

04:56.547 --> 04:59.175
Bill's being treated like
a scab at work.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.011
It would be nice for him
to come home and get a break.

05:02.095 --> 05:04.013
Well, wasn't he hired
to do the work

05:04.097 --> 05:06.891
of a bunch of guys from Treasury
who are also behind bars?

05:06.975 --> 05:07.976
Look, he doesn't like
the president

05:08.059 --> 05:10.603
any more than you do,
but a-a crisis happened.

05:10.687 --> 05:12.772
And he stepped up.
God bless.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.692
Yeah, he did.
Some daughters would be proud.

05:15.775 --> 05:16.776
Well, some moms would
be excited

05:16.859 --> 05:18.611
their 16-year-old was
politically engaged.

05:18.695 --> 05:21.698
Yeah? What else do you wanna
tell me about being a mom?

05:24.242 --> 05:25.702
Okay.

05:28.413 --> 05:29.872
I didn't mean it that way.

05:33.543 --> 05:34.627
I have an interview today.

05:34.711 --> 05:36.170
I'm trying to get out
of your hair.

05:36.254 --> 05:38.006
Really?

05:38.089 --> 05:39.966
At Brookings.

05:40.049 --> 05:41.134
That's great.

05:41.217 --> 05:43.845
I-I mean, there's no rush,
but I...

05:43.928 --> 05:45.346
I just think you'll
feel better...

05:45.430 --> 05:46.764
No, I know. I know.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.310
You cooked.
I'll clean up.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.563
- You sure?
- Yeah. Go.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.197
Ow. Shit.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.062
<i>Members of the court,
the president</i>

07:16.145 --> 07:17.980
of the United States.

07:28.950 --> 07:31.202
Please sit.

07:39.502 --> 07:42.505
General McClendon,

07:42.588 --> 07:44.549
you will take your seat.

07:47.677 --> 07:49.428
Yes, sir.

07:57.812 --> 08:00.189
Madam President.

08:05.611 --> 08:09.615
I know you'll find this hard
to believe, Mr. McClendon,

08:09.699 --> 08:12.702
but this isn't about you
anymore.

08:12.785 --> 08:13.786
The trial is over,

08:13.870 --> 08:16.706
your guilt
now a matter of record.

08:16.789 --> 08:20.960
Thanks to Judge Randolph
and the members of this panel,

08:21.043 --> 08:23.296
justice has been served.

08:24.714 --> 08:28.050
No, I am not here
because of you.

08:28.134 --> 08:30.595
I am here on behalf
of the country

08:30.678 --> 08:32.096
you swore to protect

08:32.180 --> 08:34.682
every time you put on
that uniform.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.517
I am here on behalf

08:36.601 --> 08:39.228
of the six families
sitting in this courtroom,

08:39.312 --> 08:43.524
all of whom lost loved ones
to the hail of bullets and bombs

08:43.608 --> 08:46.402
you unleashed on
the streets of New York.

08:46.485 --> 08:50.198
Murder, conspiracy to
commit murder,

08:50.281 --> 08:52.742
sedition.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.203
We execute people for that
in this country,

08:55.286 --> 08:56.537
Mr. McClendon,

08:56.621 --> 08:59.582
and if that sounds harsh,
so be it.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.710
Because what was under attack
that day wasn't just me

09:02.793 --> 09:05.421
or the office
of the Presidency,

09:05.504 --> 09:08.841
but our very democracy itself.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.179
Well, I'm not sure if
going after him directly

09:13.262 --> 09:14.388
was the best move.

09:14.472 --> 09:16.807
He openly challenged me.
What was I supposed to do?

09:16.891 --> 09:18.559
Well, you might've stuck
to the script.

09:18.643 --> 09:20.353
I had to respond.

09:20.436 --> 09:22.313
Senator Paley
was on CNB this morning,

09:22.396 --> 09:25.900
calling your leadership style
thuggish and authoritarian.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.360
No one's doubting
how tough you are.

09:27.443 --> 09:28.361
Good.

09:28.444 --> 09:29.946
Which makes it exactly
the right time

09:30.029 --> 09:32.949
to throttle back a little,
take your foot off the gas.

09:33.032 --> 09:34.075
Not yet.

09:34.158 --> 09:35.409
- Elizabeth...
- I said not yet.

09:35.493 --> 09:37.662
- Can I give you a quick brief?
- Sure.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.497
Paley's Committee is
about to issue

09:39.580 --> 09:42.583
its first round of subpoenas
to senior White House staff,

09:42.667 --> 09:43.834
- including myself.
- I know that, David.

09:43.918 --> 09:45.795
There's talk of
a Special Prosecutor.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.631
I know that, too. How is it
they tried to assassinate me,

09:48.714 --> 09:50.883
and I am the one
under investigation?

09:50.967 --> 09:53.427
Because we locked up
over 200 of their best friends

09:53.511 --> 09:54.595
- and neighbors.
- Yeah, for damn good reasons.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.138
Kept them for nearly
two months.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.807
Some would say
denied their civil rights.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.809
That was the other reason--
send a message.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.270
"Don't fuck with us
ever again."

10:02.353 --> 10:04.814
Yeah, well, I think
they got that loud and clear.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.400
Well, we'll see. Won't we?

10:07.483 --> 10:10.611
When the jury comes back
with the appropriate sentence.

10:11.862 --> 10:12.905
They will.

10:12.989 --> 10:14.949
They better.

10:33.676 --> 10:34.885
Well?

10:34.969 --> 10:37.096
They still got someone
stuck in one of the cars.

10:37.179 --> 10:38.806
It's gonna be a couple hours
at least

10:38.889 --> 10:39.890
before they open the road.

10:39.974 --> 10:41.517
- A couple of hours?
- Yep.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.561
- You hear that, Brett?
- Yeah, I heard.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.355
- What the hell do we do now?
- Well, it's already 12:30.

10:46.439 --> 10:49.608
Well, we're not canceling
the broadcast.

10:49.692 --> 10:50.901
I don't see we have much
of a choice.

10:50.985 --> 10:54.280
"Six days a week,
come rain or shine,

10:54.363 --> 10:56.532
hell or high water,"
that was my promise.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.201
- I won't let the people down.
- They'll understand.

10:59.285 --> 11:00.745
We've been on the run
almost two months.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.246
We haven't canceled one yet.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.206
I saw some private homes
back there.

11:04.290 --> 11:05.916
We could start
by knocking on doors.

11:06.000 --> 11:06.917
Wallace?

11:07.001 --> 11:08.836
Not a lot of people up here

11:08.919 --> 11:10.087
this time of year,
Mr. O'Keefe.

11:10.171 --> 11:12.298
Well, how 'bout we just do it
on your iPhone?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.091
Okay, even if I had
a decent signal,

11:14.175 --> 11:17.094
which I don't, I can't guarantee
the security of the connection.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.429
Do you wanna try being
reasonable

11:18.512 --> 11:20.514
just to, you know,
see how that feels?

11:20.598 --> 11:22.600
- Okay, cancel the broadcast.
- Thank you.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.519
And then call the Feds.
I'm turning myself in.

11:25.603 --> 11:27.855
You can say how unimportant
one broadcast is,

11:27.938 --> 11:30.316
but the truth is, it could be
my last broadcast.

11:30.399 --> 11:33.652
We've got the president of
the United States on the ropes.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.490
God help us all if we don't
finish her off now.

11:37.573 --> 11:38.616
There is a town.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.785
Buckminster.
One valley over.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.287
- How far?
- 20 minutes.

11:43.371 --> 11:45.831
Well, now we're talkin'.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.400
- Uh, just the bag.
- Sure.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.946
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

13:07.163 --> 13:08.706
We can't do this today.
We don't have time.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.791
- Five minutes. Less.
- Your insight was invaluable.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.376
The Senator said so himself.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.627
This is about the guy
who gave me the...

13:13.711 --> 13:14.795
Stop with the guy.

13:14.879 --> 13:16.755
We leaked what we could.
It's not enough anymore.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.258
Janet, come on. Give me
two minutes with him.

13:40.613 --> 13:43.073
I don't know how many times
you want me to say it.

13:43.157 --> 13:45.159
Deep background
is not gonna cut it.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.578
I'm aware.
That's why I'm here.

13:47.661 --> 13:50.915
My source has agreed
to go on the record.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.209
You said that was never
gonna happen.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.628
Well, you made it clear
it has to.

13:55.711 --> 13:56.795
Over a month ago, yeah.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.965
The Committee's moved on,
Ms. Mathison.

14:00.049 --> 14:02.635
I'm not gonna reopen
this line of inquiry

14:02.718 --> 14:04.220
unless you're absolutely sure

14:04.303 --> 14:06.514
this implicates
David Wellington.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.140
I'm sure.

14:08.224 --> 14:09.725
If you can guarantee
closed session testimony

14:09.808 --> 14:12.978
and identity protection,
he'll talk.

14:13.062 --> 14:14.605
Senator, I'm sorry. We're
completely in the dark here.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.690
We don't know one damn thing
about this person.

14:16.774 --> 14:18.234
Do you know what happens to him
if his identity is leaked?

14:18.317 --> 14:22.446
Or me? This administration
jails federal employees.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.491
So he's a federal employee?

14:27.326 --> 14:28.619
You have to give us something.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.037
You told us on
three separate occasions

14:30.120 --> 14:32.289
you were going to produce
hard evidence.

14:32.373 --> 14:34.458
You never delivered.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.253
He's a colleague.
Okay? FBI.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.130
We worked counterterrorism
together in Afghanistan.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.800
Now he's on the team
interrogating the suspects

14:42.883 --> 14:44.969
detained in the second wave
of arrests.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.387
I know for a fact

14:46.470 --> 14:47.763
that he has personally
interviewed 43 of them

14:47.846 --> 14:51.517
and is working his way through
the dossiers of all 200.

14:51.600 --> 14:54.061
So far, there's nothing,
nothing that connects

14:54.144 --> 14:58.482
a single one of them to
the assassination attempt.

14:58.566 --> 15:02.278
Okay. Closed session testimony,
identity protection,

15:02.361 --> 15:03.320
we can do that.

15:03.404 --> 15:06.740
There's, uh,
there's one more thing.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.617
He's asking for a face-to-face.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.995
You, me, and him, 6:00 tonight.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.746
- Where?
- The Hay-Adams.

15:12.830 --> 15:15.457
I'll text you a room number
on this phone

15:15.541 --> 15:16.875
as soon as I have one.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.753
Is the spy shit
really necessary?

15:19.837 --> 15:22.298
I'm bringing you a federal agent
to testify about

15:22.381 --> 15:24.174
some of the most expansive
civil rights abuses

15:24.258 --> 15:26.802
in the history of our nation.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.887
Is it really that hard
to use a burner?

15:31.682 --> 15:34.310
You're all we've got
on Wellington.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.395
This source of yours
turns out to be some putz

15:36.478 --> 15:38.105
overheard a rumor
at the urinal...

15:38.188 --> 15:40.274
He's not.

16:45.798 --> 16:49.426
<i>♪ Standin' on the back of that
train with your open arms ♪</i>

16:51.428 --> 16:55.182
<i>♪ Looking at the big sky,
listening to the smoke alarm ♪</i>

16:57.559 --> 16:58.936
<i>♪ You wonder what happened ♪</i>

16:59.019 --> 17:02.606
<i>♪ Well, your heart
must have jumped a track ♪</i>

17:02.690 --> 17:04.274
<i>♪ You put your lips out
in the wind and you hope... ♪</i>

17:04.358 --> 17:06.360
I think we have a winner.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.174
Hello?

17:31.719 --> 17:33.971
Hello?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.557
Can I help you?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.601
Sorry. Caught me in
the middle of my lunch.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.563
- Are you Jerome?
- Junior. Jerome's my dad.

17:42.646 --> 17:43.814
I don't have a lot
of time, Junior.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.232
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

17:45.315 --> 17:49.445
Not at all. You interested in
a mattress or a recliner?

17:51.113 --> 17:52.364
- Shit.
- Do you want me here?

17:52.448 --> 17:55.367
- No. Go right there. Yeah.
- How we doin'?

17:55.451 --> 17:56.869
We got less than two minutes.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.955
Jesus.
I'm sweatin' like a pig.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.373
Here.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.292
Go easy.

18:03.375 --> 18:06.754
Yesterday you made yourself
look like a corpse.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.633
All right. Ready?

18:11.717 --> 18:12.885
Yeah.

18:20.601 --> 18:24.563
Ooh, aah.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.648
Shit.

18:26.732 --> 18:27.649
What is it?

18:32.780 --> 18:35.032
Okay. And...

18:35.115 --> 18:37.201
we are on in...

18:37.284 --> 18:40.704
three, two, one...

18:40.788 --> 18:42.748
Wow!
That was cuttin' it close.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.082
I didn't think
we were actually gonna

18:44.166 --> 18:46.877
make it to camera there
for a minute.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.087
Praise the Lord.
This is Brett O'Keefe.

18:49.171 --> 18:51.256
Welcome to day 52
of the Resistance.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.258
You know, you learn a lot
over the years

18:53.342 --> 18:55.886
running a major media
organization.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.262
And the one thing that
I've learned

18:57.346 --> 18:59.723
is when the government
pushes back on something

18:59.807 --> 19:02.142
and pushes back hard,
a lot of times

19:02.226 --> 19:04.728
it's because you're hittin'
too close to home.

19:04.812 --> 19:07.856
No coincidence, then,
the warrant for my arrest

19:07.940 --> 19:10.651
came the day after

19:10.734 --> 19:13.070
I broke the news here
on Real.Truth that

19:13.153 --> 19:15.364
the attempt on
the president's life was a hoax,

19:15.447 --> 19:19.034
an inside job staged
to boost her approval ratings

19:19.117 --> 19:22.287
and justify a tyrannical purge

19:22.371 --> 19:25.666
of her enemies.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.753
Just this mornin',

19:29.837 --> 19:31.255
my sources tell me,

19:31.338 --> 19:33.090
she was at
the Washington Navy Yard

19:33.173 --> 19:34.258
in a rage,

19:34.341 --> 19:36.510
calling for
General Jamie McClendon

19:36.593 --> 19:39.096
to be put up against a wall

19:39.179 --> 19:40.264
and shot!

19:40.347 --> 19:42.516
I'm not kidding.

19:42.599 --> 19:46.228
Bring back the firing squad!

19:48.188 --> 19:51.024
Now, to those who would try
and excuse this behavior

19:51.108 --> 19:53.485
or blame it on hormones,
I say this--

19:53.569 --> 19:56.530
yes, it's true,
Elizabeth Keane's in menopause.

19:56.613 --> 19:57.990
I've seen the medical records.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.576
But this isn't about
hot flashes, my friends.

20:00.659 --> 20:04.705
This is
a ruthless political machine

20:04.788 --> 20:07.833
hell-bent on stealin'
the country

20:07.916 --> 20:11.211
right out from under our noses.

20:37.696 --> 20:38.906
Just one night?

20:38.989 --> 20:40.490
Yep. My company's
putting me up here.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.117
I can't believe they picked
a place this nice.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.870
Oh, good. It'll be kind of
like a mini vacation.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.747
Right? Is there a spa?

20:46.830 --> 20:48.081
Uh, there is.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.167
You should treat yourself
to a massage.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.837
You know what? I think
that's an excellent idea.

20:53.921 --> 20:56.214
Jack, can you show
Ms. Mathison to room 509?

20:56.298 --> 20:57.633
Of course.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.593
Thank you.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.645
Wow. Can't remember
the last time

21:09.728 --> 21:11.647
I had a king-sized bed
to myself.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.149
- Um, you can just
put it on the bed.
- All right.

21:16.860 --> 21:17.778
Uh...

21:17.861 --> 21:20.614
- Thank you.
- Oh. Thank you.

23:01.131 --> 23:03.759
Checking in.
Uh, Lisa Salter.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.260
- S-A-L.
- Let's see.

23:05.343 --> 23:07.429
Yes, Mrs. Salter.

23:07.512 --> 23:09.431
We have you in a suite,
and that's just for tonight.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.849
Uh, my husband's
coming in later.

23:10.932 --> 23:12.642
Can you leave an extra key
here for him?

23:12.726 --> 23:14.644
Of course.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.354
Thank you.

23:32.746 --> 23:34.039
Hi.

23:42.714 --> 23:44.716
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.041
I'm sorry.

24:18.125 --> 24:21.378
I know it's not the outcome
we were hoping for.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.879
But on the plus side,

24:22.963 --> 24:24.673
McClendon has been
dishonorably discharged,

24:24.756 --> 24:27.134
stripped of his rank,

24:27.217 --> 24:29.803
and will spend the rest of
his life in prison on lockdown.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.346
- Don't sugarcoat it.
- I'm not.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.390
A panel of eight generals
and four admirals

24:33.473 --> 24:35.392
deemed that his actions
did not rise

24:35.475 --> 24:37.310
to the level
of a capital offense.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.896
You don't think that's a problem
for us going forward?

24:39.980 --> 24:41.731
I don't think it was
the entire panel.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.108
All it takes is one juror.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.860
The vote for death
has to be unanimous.

24:44.943 --> 24:48.071
One juror? They deliberated for
less than half a day, David.

24:48.155 --> 24:50.824
The vote wasn't even close.
In fact, it comes

24:50.907 --> 24:52.909
damn near condoning
another attempt on my life.

24:52.993 --> 24:54.786
Well, now you're being
paranoid.

24:54.870 --> 24:55.996
You said
you were handling this.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.247
I did what I could.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.499
But the last time the military
executed one of its own

24:59.583 --> 25:01.877
- was in 1961.
- The last time they tried

25:01.960 --> 25:04.588
to overthrow the government
was never.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.597
You're gonna have to put this
behind you, Elizabeth.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.474
- Move on.
- Madam President.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.226
Excuse me?

25:18.310 --> 25:19.686
In this room,
it's Madam President,

25:19.769 --> 25:20.812
not Elizabeth.

25:20.896 --> 25:22.230
Get in the habit.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.357
You slipped the other day
in front of Counsel.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.567
Madam President.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.902
And the last thing
I need right now

25:26.985 --> 25:30.363
is some trite lecture about
the past being the past

25:30.447 --> 25:31.907
and moving on.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.075
I didn't bring you back
from political exile

25:34.159 --> 25:35.994
to be my girlfriend.

25:40.457 --> 25:41.625
Now fix it.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.877
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.714
I can't.

25:47.797 --> 25:50.467
Then I'll find somebody who can.

26:04.856 --> 26:06.942
Thanks.

27:08.295 --> 27:10.297
Here's something
off 4chan/pol --

27:10.380 --> 27:12.507
"America, land of the free
and home of the brave--

27:12.590 --> 27:14.884
"literally a place where
no one bats an eye

27:14.968 --> 27:17.262
"when the president does
whatever the fuck she wants,

27:17.345 --> 27:18.680
but at least fast food
is cheap."

27:20.849 --> 27:24.060
I like that.
I might use that.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.186
It sounds a lot like the guy

27:25.270 --> 27:28.523
we got all that
good Bureau stuff from.

27:30.442 --> 27:31.735
Sharon?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.070
Yeah.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.655
What do you think?

27:35.739 --> 27:37.782
I think...

27:37.866 --> 27:39.868
I can't do this anymore.

27:42.746 --> 27:45.373
Look, I know you're mad.
I went there again

27:45.457 --> 27:46.583
- when I said I wouldn't.
- It's not that.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.918
The word "menopause" never
crosses my lips again,

27:49.002 --> 27:51.129
- swear to God.
- Brett, I'm exhausted.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.506
I'm done.
And I wanna go home.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.176
Hey. Hey,
what's the matter?

27:56.259 --> 27:58.386
You know what's the matter.
I haven't slept in the same bed

27:58.470 --> 27:59.971
in over a month.
That's what's the matter.

28:00.055 --> 28:04.059
Last night wasn't even a bed.
That wasn't even a couch.

28:04.142 --> 28:05.518
Seriously,
put a gun to my head,

28:05.602 --> 28:07.312
I couldn't tell you what state
we're in right now.

28:07.395 --> 28:10.065
My clothes are filthy,
my hair is a mess,

28:10.148 --> 28:11.941
and I miss my cat.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.777
- Aw, baby.
- No, no, no, Brett, don't.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.488
It's not gonna work this time.

28:23.828 --> 28:26.122
Jesus. Get the laptop.
Come on.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.046
Give it to me.

28:39.386 --> 28:40.845
Yeah.

28:50.397 --> 28:53.441
Gah! Shit.

28:53.525 --> 28:57.320
Okay, boys. You got me.
Congratulations.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.822
Our country now's officially
in the shitter.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.408
Easy. Easy, Mr. O'Keefe.
You're not under arrest.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.451
- What?
- We're not arresting you.

29:03.535 --> 29:05.161
- You're not?
- No, sir.

29:05.245 --> 29:07.330
Look, there's federal marshals
on their way here from Oroville.

29:07.414 --> 29:08.832
We gotta get you
outta here, fast.

29:08.915 --> 29:11.000
You can put
your hands down now.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.836
Well, that's just...

29:12.919 --> 29:15.672
I don't even know what to say.
I'm at a loss for words.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.257
- Thank you.
- Don't thank us yet.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.385
- We need to get a move on.
- Oh, lead the way.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.763
Hey, what are you doin'?

29:23.847 --> 29:25.181
I'm not going. I told you.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.808
Are you kiddin'?
You heard the man.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.351
The Feds will be here
any minute.

29:28.435 --> 29:29.769
- I'll take my chances.
- Come on, Sharon.

29:29.853 --> 29:31.563
You know I can't
do this alone.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.314
I'll call Andy or Joel
when I get back to New York.

29:33.398 --> 29:34.941
Or Barclay. I heard from her
a couple days ago.

29:35.024 --> 29:37.735
Not one of them has ever
made me laugh.

29:38.736 --> 29:40.071
Come on, Shar.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.531
It's not that I can't
do this alone.

29:41.614 --> 29:45.285
It's that I can't do this
without you.

29:45.368 --> 29:47.996
Please, don't break up
the band, not like this.

29:48.079 --> 29:51.124
Not without an actual
conversation.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.543
Couple days.
That's all I'm askin'.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.753
Please.

30:19.402 --> 30:20.737
I have a reservation.

30:20.820 --> 30:22.238
Okay, great.
That would be helpful.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.282
- Yes, sir?
- Mrs. Salter left a key for me.

30:24.365 --> 30:28.077
Yes. Here you go.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.163
Thank you very much.
The elevators?

30:30.246 --> 30:31.998
Other side of the stairs.

31:36.187 --> 31:38.398
Excuse me? Uh, could I talk
to you for a second?

31:38.481 --> 31:39.607
Sure. How can I help you?

31:39.691 --> 31:41.693
I don't...

31:41.776 --> 31:42.902
This is embarrassing, but...

31:42.986 --> 31:44.654
Are you all right?

31:44.737 --> 31:48.283
Yeah, I'm fine. I...

31:48.366 --> 31:51.494
Y-you see the guy who's sitting
in the corner way back there?

31:51.578 --> 31:54.414
The gentleman
in the yellow chair?

31:54.497 --> 31:56.708
Yeah, I-I was coming out of
the ladies room, you know,

31:56.791 --> 31:58.376
in that...
in that little hallway.

31:58.459 --> 31:59.627
Of course.

31:59.711 --> 32:03.756
And he was standing there
with his... just out.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.967
- Exposing himself?
- Yes.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.219
Oh, my goodness. Ryan.

32:08.303 --> 32:11.055
I don't wanna, like,
go to the cops,

32:11.139 --> 32:13.516
but, you know, what if there's
a kid around or something?

32:13.600 --> 32:15.435
No, no, no. Of course.
We'll take care of it.

32:15.518 --> 32:17.729
- I am so sorry.
- Thank you.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.025
Talk to you for a second.

32:41.461 --> 32:44.088
I found the stash.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.591
- What the fuck?
- What did you bring?

32:46.674 --> 32:48.843
Nothing.
You said no phone, no wallet,

32:48.926 --> 32:50.053
nothing but the burner
you gave me.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.387
- Badge?
- Everything's in the car,

32:51.471 --> 32:52.930
which is back at the office.
I walked.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.265
What about the burner?
Did you leave it

32:54.349 --> 32:55.725
on your desk at work?
Did you take off your jacket

32:55.808 --> 32:59.187
- to go take a piss?
- I...

33:01.356 --> 33:03.066
Motherfucker!

33:03.983 --> 33:05.777
You have a tail.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.986
Fuck.

33:08.363 --> 33:11.074
We have to go.
We have to go now.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.621
Who?

33:16.704 --> 33:18.081
I don't fucking know who.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.802
- Get in.
- What?

33:30.885 --> 33:32.220
I stalled the guy, but only
for a couple minutes.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.971
I have to get you
out of here.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.306
I'm aborting this meeting.

33:35.390 --> 33:36.891
Nobody saw us together.
Nothing happened.

33:36.974 --> 33:38.226
They threw a reporter
in jail today.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.019
They're losing their mind
over these leaks.

33:40.103 --> 33:41.729
They weren't looking for
some idiot from <i>Politico.</i>

33:41.813 --> 33:44.649
They were looking for you.
Get in the car.

34:19.809 --> 34:21.102
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:23.646
Hey, it's me. I need to change
the venue for tonight.

34:23.730 --> 34:25.857
- Is he still there?
<i>- Yeah. Is something wrong?</i>

34:25.940 --> 34:28.025
No, no. All good.
I just found a better spot.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.486
Uh, I'll text you with
the address in a few minutes.

34:30.570 --> 34:32.113
<i>Okay.
I'll let the Senator know.</i>

34:55.052 --> 34:56.387
Thank you.

35:00.725 --> 35:03.060
Mr. Berenson.

35:03.144 --> 35:06.063
I-I don't believe we've met.

35:11.569 --> 35:12.862
But, full disclosure,

35:12.945 --> 35:16.407
the president doesn't know
I'm here tonight.

35:27.460 --> 35:31.339
Between us,
she's feeling a little...

35:31.422 --> 35:33.841
friendless these days

35:33.925 --> 35:35.176
and vulnerable.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.220
Tell her to get over it.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.514
She will.

35:39.597 --> 35:42.141
Job is to put
the country first.

35:42.225 --> 35:45.478
Well, not first. First, she has
to clear a path to power.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.188
Otherwise, she's Jimmy Carter.

35:47.271 --> 35:48.856
Mm.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.817
She keeps this up,

35:50.900 --> 35:53.402
undermining the rule of law,

35:53.486 --> 35:56.823
debasing her
democratic institutions,

35:56.906 --> 35:59.075
she won't last as long
as Jimmy Carter.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.244
Agreed.

36:01.327 --> 36:03.746
That's where you come in.

36:03.830 --> 36:05.790
She needs an ally.

36:05.873 --> 36:08.125
A show of faith and forgiveness

36:08.209 --> 36:10.753
on your part, well, it...

36:10.837 --> 36:13.422
could really help
turn things around.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.552
I'm a little indisposed
at the moment.

36:17.635 --> 36:19.804
Blame that on me,
not the president.

36:19.887 --> 36:21.097
It was my mistake.

36:21.180 --> 36:24.183
Obviously, you weren't part
of the plot against her.

36:24.267 --> 36:27.311
- Yet here I am.
- Not for long, I hope.

36:27.395 --> 36:30.565
Now, you said,
"Put the country first."

36:30.648 --> 36:34.026
I'm offering you an opportunity
to do just that.

36:34.110 --> 36:37.613
- Job, you mean?
- Yes.

36:37.697 --> 36:41.450
Of course, I'd have to run it
by the boss, but...

36:41.534 --> 36:44.704
how does National Security
Advisor sound?

36:47.707 --> 36:51.168
Surprised?

36:51.252 --> 36:54.797
I'm in a fucking federal prison.
What do you think?

36:54.881 --> 36:57.174
Yeah, I'm surprised.

36:58.843 --> 37:00.678
And interested?

37:01.846 --> 37:03.556
Depends.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.308
On what?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.268
A lot of things.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.020
Okay.

37:09.103 --> 37:10.771
Go ahead.

37:12.648 --> 37:15.026
Well...

37:15.109 --> 37:17.737
Oval Office privileges,
for starters.

37:17.820 --> 37:19.739
Direct access to the president.

37:19.822 --> 37:22.491
Well, I think I can
live with that.

37:22.575 --> 37:25.161
Can't be just me.

37:25.244 --> 37:27.538
Everybody swept up in
the second wave of arrests

37:27.622 --> 37:29.665
must also be released.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.543
They will be when
the investigation is complete.

37:32.627 --> 37:36.005
- No. Now.
- Impossible.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.382
They're all innocent.
You know that.

37:38.466 --> 37:41.052
The president will never agree.

37:41.135 --> 37:43.179
Then neither can I.

37:44.722 --> 37:46.891
Mr. Berenson...

37:46.974 --> 37:49.143
think what you're turning down.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.937
It's non-negotiable.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.817
Well...

37:56.901 --> 37:58.861
I'm sorry you feel that way.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.446
I'm sorry <i>she</i> does.

38:04.325 --> 38:09.121
I will not carry water
or make excuses

38:09.205 --> 38:13.542
for a woman who can't rise above
her own vindictiveness.

38:44.907 --> 38:48.119
You're a total lifesaver.

38:48.202 --> 38:49.370
Thanks so much for doing this.

38:49.453 --> 38:51.622
Is that a wig?

38:51.706 --> 38:53.749
Uh, I'll explain at home.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.918
Um, where'd you tell your mom
you were going?

38:56.002 --> 38:58.796
Oh, she's out. They're seeing
something at the Woolly Mammoth.

38:58.879 --> 39:00.256
Who's with Franny?

39:00.339 --> 39:01.757
Jason.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.843
Who the hell is Jason?

39:03.926 --> 39:05.219
He's a guy.

39:05.302 --> 39:06.971
Yeah, no, I got that.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.472
No, and-and Franny was asleep.

39:08.556 --> 39:10.099
And she liked him anyway

39:10.182 --> 39:11.726
so if she wakes up,
she won't freak out.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.981
All right. Keys, please.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.233
- Yeah. Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.694
I'll be home soon. If your
parents get back before I do...

39:21.777 --> 39:23.988
I won't tell them anything.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.700
Is everything okay?

39:27.783 --> 39:30.953
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's... it's just...

39:31.037 --> 39:34.123
Go. Go.

40:35.559 --> 40:36.644
I thought you were gonna
let me out

40:36.727 --> 40:38.062
down the street from the hotel.

40:38.145 --> 40:40.314
I had to make sure they
didn't have a car on us.

40:40.397 --> 40:42.566
For an hour?

40:44.902 --> 40:46.737
Who's Margaret Mathison, MD?

40:46.821 --> 40:48.280
My sister.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.201
You want a water?
I think there's

40:52.284 --> 40:54.870
- a mini fridge here somewhere.
- Yeah, whatever you got.

40:54.954 --> 40:57.456
You okay?

40:57.540 --> 40:59.208
Apart from the concussion, yeah.

41:02.586 --> 41:04.046
Here.

41:09.844 --> 41:12.680
I can't believe
I fell for that twice.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.432
Kabul? Trunk of your car?

41:15.516 --> 41:17.059
You still drive like a maniac.

41:17.143 --> 41:18.352
Thanks.

41:18.435 --> 41:19.687
Feels like about
a hundred years ago.

41:19.770 --> 41:20.896
Yeah.

41:22.356 --> 41:25.067
Hey, I was really sorry
to hear what went down.

41:25.151 --> 41:28.904
I can't believe they laid
that clusterfuck at your feet.

41:28.988 --> 41:32.032
Worst bit is, he slipped
the net. Abu Rami did.

41:32.116 --> 41:34.118
And once I get back
in counterterrorism,

41:34.201 --> 41:36.370
I know a guy in Kandahar
can help me track him down.

41:36.453 --> 41:40.040
So what's this all about?

41:40.124 --> 41:42.084
Why am I here?

41:42.168 --> 41:45.004
Let's sit.

41:51.802 --> 41:53.637
We're not getting anywhere.

41:53.721 --> 41:55.639
The investigation's
at a dead end.

41:55.723 --> 41:58.976
Senator Paley really needs
to talk to you.

41:59.059 --> 42:01.187
- No, please, please. Just...
- How many times you gotta hear

42:01.270 --> 42:03.230
the same thing?
I'm not going on the record.

42:03.314 --> 42:04.398
Let's cross that bridge
when we get to it.

42:04.481 --> 42:06.108
No. There's no bridge
that goes there.

42:06.192 --> 42:07.443
Even if I get you
closed session,

42:07.526 --> 42:10.404
- guaranteed identity protection?
- You're not hearing.

42:10.487 --> 42:11.989
Would be the end of my career.

42:12.072 --> 42:13.616
You don't have a career.

42:13.699 --> 42:16.702
Excuse me?

42:17.828 --> 42:19.830
I'm sorry. You don't.

42:19.914 --> 42:22.625
It's been four years
since Kabul.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.169
Civilians died,
an ambassador was recalled.

42:25.252 --> 42:27.546
That stain is not
coming off you. Not ever.

42:27.630 --> 42:29.590
You don't know that.

42:29.673 --> 42:33.802
Have you had a promotion since?
Or even a commendation?

42:36.013 --> 42:37.097
Listen to me.

42:37.181 --> 42:39.767
Four years ago,
a guy stormed into my station,

42:39.850 --> 42:42.353
demanded two humvees
and a sat phone,

42:42.436 --> 42:44.230
and 48 hours later,
located number three

42:44.313 --> 42:45.940
- on our Most Wanted List.
- Don't...

42:46.023 --> 42:47.858
- No, I'm serious.
- That wasn't your team.

42:47.942 --> 42:49.360
- That was you.
- Fuck you.

42:49.443 --> 42:51.111
This the part where you
tell me I'm still that guy?

42:51.195 --> 42:54.198
You are. Why else would you
come to me with this?

42:54.281 --> 42:56.200
Yeah, believe me,
I'm asking myself

42:56.283 --> 42:59.328
- the same question right now.
- Well, you care is why.

42:59.411 --> 43:03.165
You can't stand this shit
any more than I can.

43:05.084 --> 43:07.211
Look, I know you thought
fighting terrorists was

43:07.294 --> 43:11.090
the most important work you'd
ever do in your life, but...

43:11.173 --> 43:15.052
What if this is?

43:21.016 --> 43:22.893
- Who is that?
- Shit.

43:22.977 --> 43:24.144
Who is it?

43:26.230 --> 43:27.648
It's Senator Paley.

43:27.731 --> 43:29.566
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:29.650 --> 43:30.567
H-Hang on one minute.

43:30.651 --> 43:31.860
You just asked me
to think about it.

43:31.944 --> 43:33.946
And if you're not ready,
I will tell him to leave.

43:34.029 --> 43:37.741
Mathison, open the door.

43:37.825 --> 43:39.618
Um, you're a little bit early.
If you could just...

43:39.702 --> 43:40.869
- Is this him?
- What did she tell you?

43:40.953 --> 43:43.872
Nothing. I did not tell
him anything.

43:43.956 --> 43:45.040
She told me you're ready
to testify.

43:45.124 --> 43:47.209
Please. Please, stop talking.

43:48.502 --> 43:50.212
What's going on here?

43:50.296 --> 43:51.380
She's a liar,
is what's going on.

43:51.463 --> 43:53.007
If you sit down for one minute,
this will be

43:53.090 --> 43:56.135
- a totally confidential meeting.
- Back the fuck away from me.

43:56.218 --> 43:57.678
Look, it would be really great

43:57.761 --> 43:59.513
if you could just step outside
for five minutes.

43:59.596 --> 44:01.390
Nobody's testifying.
I don't know what kind

44:01.473 --> 44:04.476
of bullshit she fed you,
but she's out of her mind.

44:04.560 --> 44:07.146
You never saw me,
you never met me,

44:07.229 --> 44:08.564
you bet your fucking life

44:08.647 --> 44:10.357
you're not getting
a single word out of me.

44:10.441 --> 44:12.401
Please. Please, don't do this.
You can trust him.

44:12.484 --> 44:14.653
- Dante, please...
- Do not say my name again.

44:14.737 --> 44:16.071
I'm sorry. I-I'm so sorry.
But please don't go.

44:16.155 --> 44:17.906
- Get out of my way.
- You don't have to say anything.

44:17.990 --> 44:19.575
You just have to listen
to what...

44:19.658 --> 44:21.201
Get the fuck out of my way!

44:21.285 --> 44:22.745
No. No.

44:22.828 --> 44:24.413
- You're not leaving.
- Carrie...

44:36.091 --> 44:37.509
Jesus Christ.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.928
You can't call me again.

45:04.244 --> 45:06.246
Sorry, sir. President asked for
bug sweeps, home and office.

45:06.330 --> 45:08.749
- All senior staff.
- No, we are not doing this.

45:08.832 --> 45:11.085
- The order came straight from...
- I'll deal with the president.

45:11.168 --> 45:15.089
- She specifically asked...
- Get the fuck out of my house.

45:15.172 --> 45:16.673
Is that order clear?

45:19.009 --> 45:21.011
Walk. Move. Go.

45:21.095 --> 45:23.263
Let's go.

45:55.421 --> 45:59.425
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

46:01.051 --> 46:04.638
We left the play halfway through
and came home to find

46:04.721 --> 46:08.559
nobody here but Franny
and some pot dealer

46:08.642 --> 46:10.686
watching MTV together
on the couch.

46:10.769 --> 46:12.396
He's not a pot dealer.

46:12.479 --> 46:13.814
Josie was nowhere to be found.

46:13.897 --> 46:14.982
Fortunately,
the pot dealer was here

46:15.065 --> 46:17.609
to tell us
that she had taken the car

46:17.693 --> 46:19.027
and was driving around
in the middle of the night

46:19.111 --> 46:21.905
because "Aunt Carrie
really needed help."

46:21.989 --> 46:23.699
Now, what kind of help?
We don't know.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.868
Because when she finally
appeared, she clammed up,

46:25.951 --> 46:27.995
apparently, on the advice
of counsel.

46:28.078 --> 46:29.329
All right,
let's just take a breather.

46:29.413 --> 46:31.165
No, Carrie's here,
and she taught our daughter

46:31.248 --> 46:32.374
how to lie to us.

46:32.458 --> 46:34.251
I wanna know what happened.

46:35.878 --> 46:38.213
I'd rather not talk about it
in front of Josie.

46:38.505 --> 46:40.132
Oh, that's closing the barn door
after the horses already...

46:40.215 --> 46:41.800
Josie, go to your room.

46:59.276 --> 47:02.696
I needed to have
a meeting with a source.

47:02.779 --> 47:06.408
I was not able to secure
my initial location,

47:06.492 --> 47:07.951
and so...

47:10.162 --> 47:13.874
...I asked Josie to bring me
the keys to your office.

47:13.957 --> 47:16.293
- That's breaking and entering.
- No, it isn't.

47:16.376 --> 47:17.586
If it isn't a crime,
then why'd you tell my kid

47:17.669 --> 47:19.588
to lie to me about it?

47:19.671 --> 47:20.923
I'm really sorry
about that. I am.

47:21.006 --> 47:22.299
I don't give a shit. Okay?

47:22.382 --> 47:24.218
- What?
- Let me talk to her, okay?

47:24.301 --> 47:25.677
Is my voice gonna upset her?

47:25.761 --> 47:28.472
I-Is the gentle management of
Carrie's emotional state

47:28.555 --> 47:31.600
- really the only priority
in this household?
- Stop. Stop.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.289
I went through some bills
in your room.

47:54.373 --> 47:56.792
What?

47:58.043 --> 48:01.713
You have $38,000
in credit card debt.

48:03.340 --> 48:06.051
Which has what
to do with anything?

48:06.134 --> 48:10.138
On eight different cards,
in a variety of aliases.

48:10.222 --> 48:11.807
You don't have a job.

48:11.890 --> 48:14.434
Please tell me you realize
we've been here before.

48:14.518 --> 48:18.272
Jesus. You know, not every shred
of non-conventional behavior

48:18.355 --> 48:20.357
boils down to an onset
of hypomania.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.609
Really? 'Cause if I didn't
know better, I...

48:22.693 --> 48:24.403
You don't.

48:24.486 --> 48:25.487
I was running an operation,

48:25.571 --> 48:26.905
working with
a United States senator,

48:26.989 --> 48:28.156
- Carrie.
- trying to course correct

48:28.240 --> 48:30.325
a presidency gone off the rails.

48:30.409 --> 48:32.494
Carrie! You're right.
We have a president

48:32.578 --> 48:34.496
who's behaving in ways
that-that are upsetting.

48:34.580 --> 48:36.206
Everyone's confused
and disoriented.

48:36.290 --> 48:38.500
- No, no, no, no.
- Everyone feels paranoid,

48:38.584 --> 48:39.793
and in times like this,
justifiably,

48:39.876 --> 48:41.753
- No.
- someone with your kind

48:41.837 --> 48:43.755
- of emotional history...
- No, we are not doing this.

48:43.839 --> 48:45.299
There's a vast government
conspiracy,

48:45.382 --> 48:46.717
and you're the only person who
could bring it to light.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.510
I know, Carrie.
I love you, but you...

48:48.594 --> 48:50.554
No, you will not make this
about my illness.

48:50.637 --> 48:54.224
This is happening.
The country is in free fall,

48:54.308 --> 48:56.852
tearing itself apart,
and-and you're acting like

48:56.935 --> 48:59.146
it's me off my meds.
I'm on my meds.

48:59.229 --> 49:00.272
You think I'm the problem?

49:00.355 --> 49:02.316
You're the one
married to a collaborator.

49:02.399 --> 49:05.777
Yeah.

49:08.614 --> 49:11.950
I'm sorry. I don't...
I don't mean to...

49:14.453 --> 49:16.580
Look, I am...
I am taking my meds.

49:16.663 --> 49:20.250
I'm exercising
and sleeping and eating.

49:20.334 --> 49:21.668
Something is going on,

49:21.752 --> 49:24.087
because normal people
don't act like this.

49:27.007 --> 49:29.468
When was the last time
you saw a psychiatrist?

49:30.677 --> 49:32.763
When?

49:35.432 --> 49:37.517
I don't know.

49:37.601 --> 49:39.353
How's tomorrow sound?

49:41.605 --> 49:45.192
You put my kid in danger
and yours.

49:45.275 --> 49:47.944
Never mind the fact that
throwing darts at my husband

49:48.028 --> 49:49.738
is some kind
of lawn sport for you.

49:49.821 --> 49:54.076
That shit, I've come
to expect. But the kids?

49:54.159 --> 49:56.203
You better hope
it's your illness.

52:32.692 --> 52:34.110
<i>General James McClendon</i>

52:34.194 --> 52:36.446
<i>was sentenced today
at the Washington Navy Yard.</i>

52:36.530 --> 52:39.074
<i>The 12-officer military panel
sentenced General McClendon</i>

52:39.157 --> 52:41.618
<i>to life in federal prison.</i>

52:41.701 --> 52:45.080
<i>Reports from inside the trial
suggest President Keane herself</i>

52:45.163 --> 52:47.582
<i>personally advocated for
the death penalty,</i>

52:47.666 --> 52:50.335
<i>but to no avail.
And just minutes ago,</i>

52:50.418 --> 52:52.504
<i>escorted by
U.S. Federal Marshals,</i>

52:52.587 --> 52:54.965
<i>General McClendon arrived
at Hazelton Prison</i>

52:55.048 --> 52:56.383
<i>in West Virginia,</i>

52:56.466 --> 52:59.845
<i>where he will most likely spend
the rest of his life.</i>

52:59.928 --> 53:01.888
<i>Turning to
the financial market...</i>

53:22.325 --> 53:24.703
Turn around.

53:33.587 --> 53:34.796
Hands.

53:43.763 --> 53:45.348
Jacket.

54:13.335 --> 54:15.670
<i>...18 billion up 3.5%,</i>

54:15.754 --> 54:18.173
<i>narrowly edging the S&P 500.</i>

54:18.256 --> 54:19.841
<i>It will be...</i>

54:39.527 --> 54:41.321
Arms up.

54:45.450 --> 54:46.868
Arms down.

54:48.662 --> 54:51.539
Bend over.

54:53.291 --> 54:55.335
Spread your cheeks.

54:58.171 --> 54:59.756
Stand up.

55:02.592 --> 55:03.927
Open your mouth, please.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.644
Turn your head to the left.

55:17.273 --> 55:19.150
Turn your head to the right.

55:22.445 --> 55:25.115
Dress.

56:10.869 --> 56:13.913
Aah!
