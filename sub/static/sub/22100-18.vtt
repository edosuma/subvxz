00:03.337 --> 00:05.713
ADAMA: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:05.798 --> 00:08.132
What am I?
A ghost, a demon...

00:08.217 --> 00:10.259
You're asking the wrong guy.
I'm just a piano player.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.386
Is that for me?

00:11.470 --> 00:12.512
Yeah.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.305
STARBUCK: Holy crap.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.935
Sam!

00:22.064 --> 00:23.523
STARBUCK: There's a lot
still going on in there.

00:23.607 --> 00:27.402
And there's nothing to
indicate that he's having
any kind of conscious thought.

00:27.486 --> 00:30.321
ELLEN: What if we could link
him to the data stream
like our hybrids?

00:30.406 --> 00:34.117
ROSLIN: We have to
figure out a contingency
plan for the ship now.

00:35.077 --> 00:38.371
You have to
face the fact that
you're gonna lose her.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.832
HELO: Boomer's loose.
She's got my frakking kid.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.626
MAN: Tyrol, get on
the horn to CIC and
alert the Admiral.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.002
MAN: Sir,
Boomer's pulling a jump.

00:45.295 --> 00:49.424
If she jumps, the space
shield disruption could
tear Galactica's guts out.

01:30.048 --> 01:32.467
Hey. Hey. What have you
been bitching about?

01:32.551 --> 01:34.969
It's not our fault
the resin won't bond
with these inferior alloys.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.347
In other words, it's
our fault that this goop
of yours isn't doing crap,

01:38.432 --> 01:41.225
except making this
place smell like the
inside of a latrine.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.644
Really?
I thought that was you.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.731
Lady, you work
on your side and
I'll work on mine.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on. Hey. Come on.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.110
Not with this guy.
Not now.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.278
Stop your bitching.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.446
ATHENA: Not now.

01:53.530 --> 01:54.614
Fine. Fine.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.532
No. Let's go.

02:05.334 --> 02:08.461
If John's plan all
along was to steal Hera
so he could study her...

02:08.545 --> 02:12.006
Study her? They're going to
dissect her like a frakking
lab rat, and we all know it.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.966
If he wants to
try to determine

02:14.051 --> 02:16.886
what made her
a successful
human-Cylon hybrid,

02:16.970 --> 02:19.180
he'll take her
to the colony.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.140
The colony?

02:21.225 --> 02:23.434
ELLEN: I guess you could
call it "home."

02:23.519 --> 02:26.729
It's where we and
the Centurions went
after the first war,

02:26.814 --> 02:30.858
once we convinced them
to abandon their own
experiments with evolution

02:30.943 --> 02:33.653
in exchange for
resurrection technology.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.571
She knows where it is.

02:40.410 --> 02:44.080
So you would have the
Galactica jump into a
Cylon's hornets' nest,

02:44.164 --> 02:47.500
risk everything
for one solitary,
single child.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.835
Is that what you're
telling me, Colonel?

02:48.919 --> 02:51.212
She's not just any child.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.714
With Caprica Six's
miscarriage,

02:53.799 --> 02:58.302
Hera is our people's
only hope of avoiding
eventual extinction.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.596
She may be our
only hope, too.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.226
I just...

03:07.271 --> 03:11.065
We just experienced
something remarkable.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.652
Hera wrote the
notes to a song,

03:15.904 --> 03:19.198
a song that my father
used to play to me
when I was a child.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.869
Same song that
switched us on when
we were in that nebula.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.163
The same song that
led us to Earth.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.627
Something is happening
here, something that is
greater than all of us,

03:31.712 --> 03:34.714
and that little girl is
in the middle of it.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.757
She's the key, sir.

03:38.635 --> 03:42.555
In other words,
it's our destiny to
go after her, right?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.810
Wrong.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.563
I've had it up to
here with destiny,

03:50.647 --> 03:53.983
prophecy, with God
or the Gods.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.027
Look where it's left us.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.654
(SCOFFS) The ass end
of nowhere.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.866
Nearly half of
our people gone.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.869
Earth, a worthless cinder,

04:04.953 --> 04:08.456
and I can't even walk
down the halls of my
ship without wondering

04:08.540 --> 04:11.542
if I'm gonna catch
a bullet for getting
us into this mess.

04:11.627 --> 04:12.627
(CHUCKLES)

04:16.506 --> 04:18.257
TIGH: We're alive, Bill.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.636
Four years ago,
I wouldn't have
taken odds on that.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.930
At least give us
a recon bird.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.848
We can see what
we're up against.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.568
(SIGHS) Make it
a heavy Raider.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.947
I don't want Helo
and Athena to
find out about this.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.040
Look at me.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.126
(CRYING)

04:56.129 --> 05:01.425
Look at me.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.557
You hate me, don't you?

05:10.310 --> 05:16.565
Say it.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.865
Gods frakking damn it.

05:27.744 --> 05:28.869
ATHENA: Hera?

05:29.329 --> 05:34.208

05:50.976 --> 05:53.602

that dream again.

We've got internal

Taking her to surgery.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.065
Right. I hope we
don't lose power.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.525
What's the tally?

08:04.609 --> 08:07.820
Sixty-one dead or
missing so far,
including 26 of theirs.

08:08.613 --> 08:11.198
The Leobens are
calling it the
proverbial straw,

08:11.283 --> 08:13.909
so we've got five
more jumps, max.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.328
After that, there's a
90% chance of tearing
her in half...

08:16.413 --> 08:19.039
I don't want to hear
that you are 90% sure
of anything.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.835
You come back when
you are 100% sure,
you got that?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.211
ADAMA: Go take care
of your injuries.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.754
Yes, sir.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.465
That frakking
Cylon rep, Sonja,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.844
wanted to know when
you'd be transferring
your flag.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.514
Transferring to where?
Her Baseship?
That'll be the frakking day.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.349
That's exactly
what I said.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.602
I'll get on top of
this repair detail.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.687
We'll straighten her out.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.400
ROSLIN: Must be tough,
saying goodbye to both
of your women at once?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.742
You must feel like
we're abandoning you.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.244
No one's
going anywhere.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.789
And neither one of
my women are dying.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.249
Mmm-hmm.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.669
They just need
a little more
care and attention.

(GASPS)

09:09.633 --> 09:10.716

09:17.057 --> 09:21.393
WOMAN: Admiral Adama
will be forced to
abandon Galactica.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.229
Yes.
At which point

09:23.313 --> 09:27.441
the Cylon Baseship
will be our sole
means of defense.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.443
Under the Admiral's
command,

09:29.527 --> 09:33.948
augmented by Galactica's
pilots, planes and
military personnel,

09:34.032 --> 09:35.074
as it has always been.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.785
Mr. Adama,
it sure seems

09:37.869 --> 09:41.497
like we're putting a lot
of power into the hands
of some people,

09:41.581 --> 09:43.374
and I use the
term loosely,

09:43.458 --> 09:46.210
who not so long ago were
doing their damndest
to wipe us out.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.544
APOLLO: And your
concerns are noted.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.422
As you all know...
As you...
Let me speak!

09:51.049 --> 09:55.552
As you all know, we
agreed to accept Admiral
Adama's military authority

09:55.637 --> 09:58.764
in return for a seat
on this council.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.724
We intend to abide
by that promise.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.311
Speaking of promises,
I have been complaining
about air quality

10:04.396 --> 10:06.814
aboard Hitei Kan
from day one.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.609
I am submitting
my requisition now

10:10.694 --> 10:13.737
for Galactica's CO2
and particulate scrubbers.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.616
Excuse me?
As long as we
get the FTLs.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.452
The last emergency jump,
it took six minutes
to spin up.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.620
Wait a minute.
WOMAN: Look.

10:21.705 --> 10:26.709
Obviously, we will have to
do a complete inventory of
Galactica's equipment,

10:26.793 --> 10:30.170
maybe even a lottery
in order to ensure
a comparable...

10:30.255 --> 10:31.297
Hey!

10:31.381 --> 10:34.049
...distribution of all
the equipment.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.177
Now listen to me
for one godsdamn minute!

10:37.262 --> 10:41.849
No one removes
so much as one bolt
from this battlestar,

10:41.933 --> 10:45.311
not until the Admiral
tells us we can!

10:45.395 --> 10:46.895
Really?

10:47.522 --> 10:50.149
What does Gaius Baltar
say about that?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.401
Gaius Baltar?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.572
BALTAR: Angels.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.450
Angels, I hear you say.

11:00.035 --> 11:04.747
I don't believe that angels
appear to you in some
mystical spectral form.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.753
Angels take the guise
of those who are nearest
and dearest to you.

11:12.005 --> 11:16.633
Those who can understand
your doubts and your trials,

11:18.094 --> 11:21.013
and steer you
back on the road
to salvation.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.309
I believe in these angels,

11:26.436 --> 11:28.145
because I see them.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.279
Wherever you are
in the fleet,

11:37.364 --> 11:39.782
this is Gaius Baltar
wishing you a
beautiful day.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.502
BALTAR: Excuse me,
Caprica... Caprica Six.

11:53.963 --> 11:54.963
Ah.

11:55.799 --> 11:57.508
It's good to...

12:00.387 --> 12:03.263
Listen, I heard
about your loss,

12:03.932 --> 12:07.768
and I wanted to offer you
my condolences, to tell you
how truly sorry I am.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.478
Thank you, Gaius.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.275
I see you've got your...

12:15.360 --> 12:16.902
You know, if you need
anymore, we have...

12:16.986 --> 12:18.237
I'm fine.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.072
And also, I'm not...

12:20.990 --> 12:24.576
I'm not aware of your
current situation, but if
you need a place to stay...

12:24.661 --> 12:26.537
I've no desire
to join your harem.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.746
No, look...

12:31.251 --> 12:34.545
That's not what I...
That's not what...

12:37.048 --> 12:40.884
We are trying to
make a difference
within the fleet.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.888
You haven't changed,
Gaius. Not really.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.724
I have.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.579
Colonel. Colonel.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.999
She wants to
talk to you.
Me?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.625
She is dying.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.962
Could you just take
a few minutes out of
your busy schedule

13:17.046 --> 13:18.630
and be with her?

13:26.264 --> 13:27.598
Thank you.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.017
Thank me for what?

13:31.436 --> 13:37.107
For the privilege of
finally being able to meet
my father before I die.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.738
You shouldn't
be thanking me.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.950
I've spent most
of my life trying
to kill your kind.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.248
Too much confusion.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.479

14:17.857 --> 14:20.943
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

You know what? It's too
bad they never upgraded
the FTL on this relic,

14:23.404 --> 14:26.114
but if you think
I'm gonna put up with your
sniveling and your whining

14:26.199 --> 14:29.201
for another dozen jumps,
guess again.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.079
I want my mommy.
Take me home.

cry in your sleep.

You were my husband
2,000 years before you
even met Bill Adama.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.637
Two thousand years.
That's a number.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.722
That's what it means
to me. It's nothing.

16:14.849 --> 16:17.768
But that man's friendship...
Frak!

16:18.978 --> 16:19.978
(SIGHS)

16:20.063 --> 16:21.438
You're a Cylon, Saul.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.648
Yeah.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.567
Whether you remember
that life or not,

16:26.694 --> 16:30.405
at least you must understand
what we were trying to do.

16:31.282 --> 16:36.787
We wanted to end the
cycle of war between
man and machine.

16:36.871 --> 16:37.913
That was a bust.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.915
Yes, we failed.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.210
But we have
a second chance now.

16:43.878 --> 16:44.961
Hera.

16:45.713 --> 16:51.134
Without her,
our children are going
to die off one by one,

16:51.219 --> 16:54.680
just like they're
dying right now
in Cottle's sickbay.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.264
I had a child.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.225
He died.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.647
You're wrong, Saul.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.068
You had millions.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.283
(CRIES)

17:15.993 --> 17:17.244
(SIGHS)

17:20.415 --> 17:21.581
Ellen.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.677
Come on,
you've got to be
hungry. Eat this.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.437
(SIGHS)

17:47.734 --> 17:50.652
Do you know what
I do sometimes
when I'm sad?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.992
I go to this
special place.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.581
A house where
I wanted to live

18:04.208 --> 18:06.251
with the man
that I loved.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.395
You can see this?

18:27.523 --> 18:29.107
You can project?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.571
Yeah, you can
still eat it.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.706
Missed a spot.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.085
By your left sideburn.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.922
The latch was busted.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.012
Thank you.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.097
So,

19:03.559 --> 19:08.522
do you really believe
all that bilge you were
spewing on the wireless?

19:10.525 --> 19:11.650
Bilge?

19:11.734 --> 19:12.776
Angels.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.530
The angels walking among us.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.368
The angels that bring
out our better nature,
blah, blah, blah.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.954
Yeah, I do,
as a matter of fact.

19:24.038 --> 19:27.249
Mmm-hmm.
And you've seen these
angels for yourself?

19:28.417 --> 19:30.418
With alarming regularity.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.004
Regularity.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.675
That must be important
when you're full of crap.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.510
That's charming.

19:39.387 --> 19:43.682
Absolutely charming.
And you are entitled to
your opinion, obviously.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.184
Who are you,
by the way, again?

19:46.269 --> 19:47.269
Me?

19:49.105 --> 19:50.856
I'm a dead chick,
that's who.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.108
BALTAR: All right,
and I'm full of crap.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.947
No, I mean it. I'm dead.
As in six-feet-under dead.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.033
Dead as in "crash landed,
burnt to a crisp" dead.

20:06.622 --> 20:07.747
Here.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.754
I took these off my body,
what was left of it,
anyway, on Earth.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.049
Take them.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.261
You used to be a scientist,
run some tests.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.471
Pull out the old
Cylon detector, do
whatever you need to do,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.390
because I have no idea.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.643
The only thing I know
for sure, I'm not an angel.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.223
We tried hooking
him up to the
main power grid,

21:07.308 --> 21:10.352
thought it might
help him reset
his neural net.

21:11.479 --> 21:14.898
So, in other words,
you tried to jumpstart
him like a car.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.110
Let me guess,
it didn't work
so well for you.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.447
Take a break.
Someone has to
monitor him.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.534
I'd like a minute
alone with my husband.
I'm sure you don't mind.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.172
(DOOR SHUTS)

21:56.774 --> 21:58.942
It's funny,
you know, I...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.200
I remember when

22:08.411 --> 22:11.162
I told you that
if I found out
you were a Cylon,

22:11.247 --> 22:13.748
I would put a bullet
in your head.

22:15.710 --> 22:18.294
Then some frakker
beats me to it and all
I can think about is

22:18.379 --> 22:20.255
how I can get you back.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.134
Human, Cylon,
it doesn't
seem to matter.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.928
I just wanted you back.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.559
Because you're just Sam.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.941
You were my Sam.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.204
And that's how
I'm gonna remember you.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.330
(GASPS)

22:54.415 --> 22:57.459
The neural anatomy
of fear and faith share
common afferent pathways.

23:03.966 --> 23:07.635
Flip a coin. Increased
vascular pressure marks
the threat response.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.061
Freewill scuttles
in the swamp of fear.
Do not fear the word.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.854
You are the harbinger
of death, Kara Thrace.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.565
You will lead them
all to their end.
End of line.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.487

Resume function.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.916
ADAMA: And so I walked,
like the beat cop
I used to be.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.835
When you walk,
you see things
in different ways.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.922
But when something's
out of place, you notice.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.466
A cop's eyes
always notice,

23:46.550 --> 23:50.428
and those eyes were
one thing they couldn't
take away from me.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.933
What?

Open to page 61 .

24:06.362 --> 24:07.362

24:08.739 --> 24:10.156
Don't worry.

24:12.159 --> 24:14.786
Cottle won't mind.
It's medicinal.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.957
I can't believe
you saved this.

24:26.924 --> 24:28.925
Do you remember
that day?

24:30.719 --> 24:33.012
Yes. New Caprica.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.600
Baltar's groundbreaking.
We talked and talked.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.603
About a lot of things.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.066
Guess what I'm thinking
about right now?

24:47.736 --> 24:48.945
Give me a hint.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.238
Mountains.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.950
A stream running
into a little lake.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.996
Water so clear,
it's like looking
through glass.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.956
Your cabin.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.126
The one you wanted to build.

25:07.882 --> 25:10.925
It's amazing how much
I still think about it.

25:17.933 --> 25:20.143
You know,
sometimes I wonder

25:22.229 --> 25:24.272
what home is.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.402
Is it an actual place,

25:29.486 --> 25:33.781
or is it some kind of
longing for something,
some kind of connection?

25:34.533 --> 25:37.577
You know, I spent
my whole life on Caprica.

25:38.287 --> 25:42.999
I was born in one house,
and then I moved to another.

25:44.627 --> 25:45.919
And then,

25:47.463 --> 25:48.630
this.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.259
And then, now

25:54.637 --> 25:59.557
I don't think
I've ever felt
truly at home

25:59.642 --> 26:05.647
until these last
few months here
with you.

26:12.029 --> 26:14.113
I know you love this ship.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.785
You probably love her
more than you love me.

26:18.869 --> 26:19.869
(CHUCKLES)

26:22.915 --> 26:26.376
Bill, if you don't
get us off this ship,

26:26.460 --> 26:29.295
you may lose both of us
at the same time.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.509
Won't you give us
a chance?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.925
A closed system
lacks the ability
to renew itself.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.927
Knowledge alone
is a poor primer.

27:18.012 --> 27:19.679
This has been
happening all over
the ship.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.806
Power surges,
temperature fluctuations.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.350
And now you're telling me
it's been him all along?

27:24.435 --> 27:26.436
We had no idea
he had this ability.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.979
How is he hooking into
the ship?

27:28.063 --> 27:30.231
I thought all our
systems were firewalled.

27:30.441 --> 27:33.234
Well, they are,
which is why he hasn't
accessed your computers.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.903
But the organic resins
we've been injecting
into your superstructure

27:35.988 --> 27:38.990
contain inductive elements,
not unlike nerve fibers.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.492
So he must've linked
to those, and then
through them,

27:41.577 --> 27:44.162
the electrical
circuitry embedded in
Galactica's bulkheads.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.457
And what about our FTLs,
now that we've upgraded
with your tech?

27:47.541 --> 27:49.334
Are they vulnerable?

27:51.503 --> 27:53.338
Theoretically.
TIGH: So theoretically,

27:53.422 --> 27:57.175
he could jump the
ship if he wanted to,
just like yours did.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.761
SAM: End of line.
Begin reintegration
of right hemisphere...

27:59.845 --> 28:03.431
Great.
That's all we need.
Take him offline.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.434
Do it!

28:08.062 --> 28:10.021
SAM: There's a hole
in the bucket,
dear Liza, dear Liza.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.397
There's a hole
in the bucket.

28:11.482 --> 28:13.858
A long view returns
patterns and repetitions.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.110
All has happened before
and all will happen again.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.992
TIGH: That's a
blessed relief.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.994
Cavil moved the colony.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.079
When?

28:26.413 --> 28:30.416
Judging from the
residual energy readings,
about five months ago.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.960
Just before the civil war.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.297
And you have no idea
where he moved it to?

28:38.592 --> 28:39.634
No.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.972
Now, excuse me.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.685
Anything you imagine
in here can be as real
as you want it to be.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.650
Do you want to see
a special room?

28:57.111 --> 29:00.196
A room where I thought
my daughter would live.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.818
Sir?

29:39.528 --> 29:41.529
Can I walk with you, sir?

29:43.365 --> 29:45.366
I'm going to the funeral.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.952
I understand
if you're not going.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.997
I'd like your
permission, sir,

29:51.748 --> 29:55.001
to take out a Raptor
to go and look
for my daughter.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.628
I'm sure Athena would be
willing to pilot, and...

29:57.713 --> 30:01.966
I've already sent out
a recon mission,
and they reported back.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.094
You did?
We were looking
for a facility

30:05.179 --> 30:09.056
we knew Boomer would
probably take Hera,
but it was no longer there.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.893
Sir,

30:12.978 --> 30:16.439
let me take out that Raptor.
Maybe I can find something.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.982
She's gone.

30:19.485 --> 30:23.404
I've lost a son,
and you've lost
a daughter.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.701
But I can't condone
a suicide mission,

30:29.953 --> 30:31.454
so let it go.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.543
You want me
to let it go?

30:38.212 --> 30:40.338
You're the one
who can't let go.

30:40.422 --> 30:41.881
Painting over the
holes in this bucket...

30:41.965 --> 30:45.384
This ship is dead,
but my daughter
may still be alive!

30:45.928 --> 30:51.265
I understand
your pain, Captain,
but don't lecture me.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.854
You're here to
take orders,
do you understand?

30:58.732 --> 31:00.066
I'm sorry.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.611
(STAMMERING) I'm sorry.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.367
One Raptor, Admiral.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.328
Maybe it is
a suicide mission,

31:13.664 --> 31:17.792
but at least give
me the chance to do
something. Please.

31:26.677 --> 31:29.345
ELLEN: For those that
we have lost in the past,

31:30.472 --> 31:32.598
and for those that
we are burying today...

31:32.683 --> 31:33.766
ADAMA: They gave
their lives...

31:33.850 --> 31:35.059
We must remember...

31:35.143 --> 31:36.143
...to save this ship...

31:36.228 --> 31:38.062
...there is a
higher purpose...

31:38.146 --> 31:39.981
Casualties as much...
BALTAR: And so...

31:40.107 --> 31:43.985
...as any soldier
fallen in battle...
...we mourn the
passing of our friend...

31:44.069 --> 31:45.069
Heavenly Father...

31:45.153 --> 31:46.195
We must understand...

31:46.280 --> 31:47.280
ELLEN: ...grant us
the strength...

31:47.364 --> 31:48.906
ADAMA: ...that what we
sacrifice here today...

31:48.991 --> 31:50.700
ELLEN: ...the wisdom...
ADAMA: ...are women and men...

31:50.784 --> 31:52.743
...and above all
a measure of acceptance...

31:52.828 --> 31:54.829
...of extreme courage...
...however small...

31:54.913 --> 31:56.914
...because that is
what we are.

31:56.999 --> 32:02.420
Voyagers traversing
the stars in search
of grace.

32:02.504 --> 32:03.921
WOMAN: Grace.

32:04.006 --> 32:05.464
BALTAR: Unity.
WOMAN: Unity.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.842
BALTAR: Life, love.
WOMAN: Life, love.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.803
ALL: So say we all!
ADAMA: So say we all!

32:10.929 --> 32:12.513
ALL: So say we all!

32:19.521 --> 32:21.606
ADAMA: Present arms.

32:36.330 --> 32:37.705
Dismissed.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.544
Listen to me,
for death is not the end.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.050
And I'm not talking
about Cylon resurrection.

32:50.385 --> 32:54.055
I'm talking about
the gift of eternal life

32:54.806 --> 32:57.725
that is offered to
each and every one of us.

32:59.227 --> 33:03.397
Yes, even the most
flawed amongst us.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.361
All we need is
the courage

33:10.280 --> 33:14.784
to face death when it
comes calling for us,
embrace it, even.

33:14.868 --> 33:21.248
Only then will we
truly have the ability
to cross over.

33:22.626 --> 33:26.796
As one amongst us here
has already crossed over.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.758
One amongst us here

33:32.094 --> 33:36.847
is living proof
that there is
life after death.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.645
The blood on these dog tags

33:43.605 --> 33:48.109
comes from necrotic flesh.
That means a dead body.

33:49.444 --> 33:53.531
The DNA analysis is a
1 00% proof-positive match

33:53.949 --> 33:56.951
for one Captain Kara Thrace.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.872
I told you
there were angels
walking amongst you.

34:02.082 --> 34:04.125
When will you believe me?

34:04.418 --> 34:07.420
She took these
from her own
mortal remains

34:08.547 --> 34:11.549
that lie on Earth even now,
interred with her bones...

34:11.633 --> 34:13.300
That's enough, Baltar!

34:13.385 --> 34:14.635
Ask her yourself.

34:14.678 --> 34:16.053
I will put you
in the brig now!
She will not deny it.

34:16.138 --> 34:17.430
She's not a Cylon.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.348
They've already
been revealed to us.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.059
Ask her yourself.
She will not deny it!

34:28.900 --> 34:32.194
Dismissed, everyone!
Off the deck now!

34:51.965 --> 34:55.676
Kara.
What are you doing?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.893
Okay, listen to me.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.647
I don't care, right.
I don't.

35:09.065 --> 35:12.151
We've all been through
some crazy, crazy stuff.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.070
I don't care what
you think you saw.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.908
I watched your
Viper explode.
Don't care.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.702
I'm here. You're here.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.711
This is all that matters.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.636
Okay.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.680
I'll see you around.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.015
Hmm.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.517
Kara Thrace.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.601
(LAUGHS)

36:59.301 --> 37:01.051
Everything went
smoothly, I take it?

37:01.136 --> 37:02.219
Yes.

37:02.304 --> 37:05.222
It's a shame I can't
be there to see the
expression on Ellen's face

37:05.307 --> 37:07.892
when she realizes
how we played her.

37:08.268 --> 37:11.437
You had a hard day's work.
Go get some rest.
We'll take it from here.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.567
Don't worry.
We'll take good
care of her.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.004
HERA: No. Boomer.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.550
CAVIL: There, there now.
You'll have all sorts of
new playmates pretty soon.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.010
(HERA CRYING)

37:44.512 --> 37:45.679
HERA: Boomer.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.682
Boomer!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.352
(CRYING)

39:36.916 --> 39:39.001
STARBUCK: I know you
can hear me, Sam,

39:39.794 --> 39:43.130
just like I know
on some level
you'll understand.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.550
The old me is
dead and gone,

39:47.218 --> 39:48.969
same as the old you,

39:50.013 --> 39:52.347
just took me
a while to
accept it.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.477
Which brings us
to the larger
question,

39:57.729 --> 39:59.313
why am I here?

40:00.106 --> 40:03.150
I think it has
something to do
with this music.

40:04.903 --> 40:09.907
There's a pattern there,
a pattern that I can't see.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.786
But I think
that you can.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.957
So we are going to
sit in this room
until we figure it out.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.671
Talk to me, Sam.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.056
New command.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.316
(CREAKING)

40:49.322 --> 40:51.156
You wanted to see me?

40:52.033 --> 40:53.075
Yeah.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.994
I made some decisions.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.246
Good.

40:57.330 --> 41:00.165
About time you
sent those toaster
work crews packing,

41:00.250 --> 41:01.792
for all the good
they've done.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.127
Actually,

41:03.878 --> 41:06.672
I'm stopping all the
repairs on the ship.

41:16.099 --> 41:20.519
Put out the orders that
I want the crew to start
stripping down Galactica.

41:20.603 --> 41:23.063
Pack in all the
weapons and gear.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.657
Let's start off-loading
civilians by tomorrow.

41:34.367 --> 41:38.245
Full crews and ordinances
transferred by the
end of the week.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.872
What?

41:42.834 --> 41:45.002
We're abandoning ship, Tigh.

41:46.796 --> 41:49.381
No! No, you can't do this.

41:52.093 --> 41:53.635
I have to, Saul.

41:54.596 --> 41:58.015
She's dying,
and we both know it.

41:58.099 --> 42:01.351
As your XO,
I can't let you
do this. I won't.

42:05.231 --> 42:07.524
You've never
let me down, Saul.

42:08.109 --> 42:12.112
I can't blame you
for being what you are,

42:12.780 --> 42:16.325
especially since
it includes being

42:16.409 --> 42:19.328
the finest officer
and friend I've ever had.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.165
This ship never let us down,

42:23.249 --> 42:25.792
so we're going to
send her off in style.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.762
(SIGHS)

42:38.389 --> 42:40.515
So we're gonna
do this, huh?

42:41.434 --> 42:42.434
Mmm-hmm.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.518
(SIGHS)

42:43.811 --> 42:45.854
She was a grand old lady.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.148
The grandest.

42:49.275 --> 42:52.986
To Galactica,
best ship in the fleet.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.074
To Galactica.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.563
(THEME MUSIC)
