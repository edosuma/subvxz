[cathy]:
<i>People use the color yellow</i>

00:27.650 --> 00:30.979
<i>To symbolize hope.</i>

00:31.128 --> 00:32.554
<i>Yellow...</i>

00:32.756 --> 00:36.879
<i>Like the sun</i>
<i>we rarely saw.</i>

00:37.054 --> 00:38.737
<i>When I was very young,</i>

00:38.937 --> 00:39.673
<i>I thought life would be</i>

00:39.775 --> 00:40.285
<i>Like one long and perfect</i>
<i>summer day.</i>

00:42.887 --> 00:46.770
<i>After all,</i>
<i>it started out that way.</i>

00:49.405 --> 00:51.619
<i>We were</i>
<i>four beautiful children</i>

00:51.621 --> 00:55.248
<i>With blond hair</i>
<i>and porcelain skin.</i>

00:55.250 --> 00:58.459
<i>We looked like</i>
<i>those fancy dresden dolls</i>

00:58.461 --> 01:00.771
<i>That grace shelves</i>
<i>and mantels.</i>

01:00.773 --> 01:02.922
<i>Only we weren't just admired.</i>

01:02.924 --> 01:05.556
<i>We were really loved.</i>

01:05.756 --> 01:10.096
<i>But that was before.</i>

01:14.453 --> 01:15.401
<i>"life is full of surprises,"</i>
<i>my mother used to say.</i>

01:15.550 --> 01:25.119
<i>And greed and fear and shame,</i>
<i>as I soon learned.</i>

01:26.719 --> 01:28.751
<i>And hopelessness.</i>

01:40.513 --> 01:44.605
<i>We never colored</i>
<i>even one of our paper flowers yellow</i>

02:18.877 --> 02:20.161
Give them back,
christopher.

02:20.162 --> 02:22.666
Not until you quit
pounding on my wall, you freak.

02:22.668 --> 02:24.688
[twins giggling]

02:24.690 --> 02:26.005
Hey. What do you kids
think you're doing?

02:27.450 --> 02:29.056
I don't even get a hug?

02:29.058 --> 02:30.500
-[laughter]
-dad!

02:30.502 --> 02:31.656
Daddy!

02:31.658 --> 02:35.349
Oh! I missed you all
so much!

02:35.351 --> 02:37.147
[twins]: What did you
bring us?

02:37.149 --> 02:38.399
[lid thumps]

02:38.401 --> 02:40.037
For you, son.

02:40.039 --> 02:41.001
Thank you.

02:43.089 --> 02:45.882
Did you
forget about me?

02:46.974 --> 02:48.193
[chuckling]

02:48.195 --> 02:49.188
Mm!

02:49.190 --> 02:51.533
I could never
forget about you.

02:53.011 --> 02:55.579
It's so beautiful.

02:55.581 --> 02:58.213
[d]

03:07.108 --> 03:10.029
[d]

03:17.673 --> 03:20.978
[kids laughing and giggling]

03:25.315 --> 03:27.305
Oh! I got you!

03:27.307 --> 03:28.396
[laughter]

03:28.398 --> 03:31.158
Oh!

03:31.160 --> 03:33.470
[all chuckling]

03:35.270 --> 03:36.842
I wish you never
had to go away

03:36.844 --> 03:38.094
For work again.

03:38.096 --> 03:39.732
Promise me
you won't.

03:39.734 --> 03:41.145
I hate to break up the party,

03:41.147 --> 03:43.135
But dinner's almost ready,
and I made your favorite--

03:43.137 --> 03:44.516
Homemade apple pie.

03:44.518 --> 03:45.672
Corrine,
you shouldn't have.

03:45.674 --> 03:47.567
She didn't.

03:47.569 --> 03:50.425
You forgot to
take off the bakery label.

03:50.427 --> 03:53.732
Ugh. Cathy! Could never
get anything past you, huh?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.242
Yeah, mom.

03:55.244 --> 03:56.494
What's going on?

03:56.496 --> 03:57.649
I mean, you're wearing
a new dress and perfume.

03:57.651 --> 04:01.022
Well, the wife
of a vice-president

04:01.024 --> 04:02.980
Can't wear
just any old thing.

04:02.982 --> 04:05.966
I was gonna wait
until it was 100% official,

04:05.968 --> 04:07.669
But I got promoted,

04:07.671 --> 04:10.783
And I'm now the head of sales
of the entire east coast.

04:10.785 --> 04:11.971
That's great!

04:11.973 --> 04:12.998
[dad]: Thank you.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.444
[corrine]: He got promoted!

04:16.725 --> 04:18.233
He's so smart, that's why.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.504
[sniffling]

04:22.506 --> 04:25.040
[knocking]

04:27.161 --> 04:29.375
Nobody's here.

04:31.816 --> 04:33.646
Cathy...

04:33.648 --> 04:34.866
Hey.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.976
[sighs softly]

04:38.978 --> 04:40.711
This is a big
opportunity for me.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.959
For all of us.

04:42.961 --> 04:45.592
I know what's
gonna happen.

04:45.594 --> 04:47.358
You'll be away
all the time.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.573
Mom will be busy
with the twins.

04:49.575 --> 04:53.234
Christopher will act like
he's the man of the house.

04:53.236 --> 04:55.899
[sighing]
I'll be totally forgotten.

04:55.901 --> 04:57.825
Can I tell you a secret?

04:57.827 --> 05:00.042
I bought this...

05:00.044 --> 05:01.711
On my last trip,

05:01.713 --> 05:03.670
And it's more money
than I should've spent,

05:03.672 --> 05:05.757
But the moment
I saw it,

05:05.759 --> 05:08.551
I knew you
had to have it.

05:15.327 --> 05:16.964
[chuckles softly]

05:18.025 --> 05:19.051
So, when I'm traveling,

05:19.053 --> 05:20.978
I need you
to be strong.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.001
Can you do that for me?

05:30.709 --> 05:32.409
Mommy!
Cathy's hurting me!

05:32.411 --> 05:33.501
It wouldn't hurt so much

05:33.503 --> 05:35.299
If you'd sit still
for five seconds.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.584
Girls, please.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.836
Your dad's gonna be home
in less than two hours,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.152
I need to ice the cake,
chill the champagne--

05:39.154 --> 05:40.212
Where are your brothers?

05:40.214 --> 05:42.299
Why do I have to
wear a tie?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.969
'cause we're
the "dresden dolls."

05:43.971 --> 05:45.350
I don't wanna
be a doll.

05:45.352 --> 05:47.212
It's just a saying,
darling.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.172
Because the neighbors
think we look so perfect.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.162
[chuckles]:
We are perfect.

05:54.246 --> 05:56.814
[music plays on the stereo,
people chatter]

05:58.806 --> 06:01.246
[d]

06:04.490 --> 06:06.255
Why isn't
he here yet?

06:06.257 --> 06:08.342
He's probably just
stuck in traffic.

06:08.344 --> 06:10.044
When are we gonna
eat the cake?

06:10.045 --> 06:11.199
I want it now!

06:11.201 --> 06:12.388
Can I take off
my tie, please?

06:12.390 --> 06:13.447
Just be patient,
darlings, okay?

06:13.449 --> 06:15.920
I'm going to go
freshen the ice.

06:15.922 --> 06:17.236
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:17.238 --> 06:18.970
-[car door shuts]
I hear someone in the driveway.

06:18.972 --> 06:20.768
[excited murmuring
and bustling]

06:23.499 --> 06:26.581
[door creaks open]

06:26.583 --> 06:28.411
[footsteps approaching]

06:32.490 --> 06:33.613
Mrs. Dollanganger?

06:33.615 --> 06:36.503
I'm sorry, but, um...

06:36.505 --> 06:39.971
There's been
an accident.

06:39.973 --> 06:42.861
[d]

07:07.813 --> 07:09.738
Mama?

07:09.740 --> 07:12.628
[d]

07:12.630 --> 07:14.779
Mom?

07:27.143 --> 07:29.358
Alright, guys,
five more minutes.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.348
Is daddy
coming home tonight?

07:35.332 --> 07:37.193
No.

07:38.671 --> 07:40.628
Remember? We told you.

07:41.882 --> 07:43.615
He died.

07:45.607 --> 07:48.431
Sometimes,
when I really miss him,

07:48.433 --> 07:50.358
I just pretend
he's on a business trip

07:50.360 --> 07:52.992
And that he'll
be back any day.

07:55.369 --> 07:57.423
You guys wash up for dinner.

08:02.048 --> 08:03.203
[footsteps]

08:03.205 --> 08:04.776
[sighs]

08:06.576 --> 08:09.657
Mom, um, the twins want you
to read them a story.

08:09.659 --> 08:10.685
Is that the mail?

08:13.800 --> 08:15.245
Madame pomfrey says

08:15.247 --> 08:17.331
I can't stay
in ballet class,

08:17.333 --> 08:19.355
Unless we pay
for last month.

08:21.475 --> 08:23.305
Are we gonna be
okay without dad?

08:23.307 --> 08:25.167
I'm doing
the best I can.

08:25.169 --> 08:26.965
It's not easy
for a woman to get a job

08:26.966 --> 08:29.085
And to support four kids
on her own.

08:29.087 --> 08:31.139
Look at me,
I'm an ornament.

08:31.141 --> 08:32.648
The only thing
I was ever good at

08:32.650 --> 08:33.772
Was being pretty.

08:37.756 --> 08:40.259
You know...

08:40.260 --> 08:41.799
You're lucky.

08:41.802 --> 08:43.534
You had a dad that
thought you were special.

08:43.537 --> 08:45.621
Because I'm just like you.

08:45.623 --> 08:47.516
Well, in looks, maybe,

08:47.518 --> 08:49.443
But you're more aggressive
and determined.

08:49.444 --> 08:51.145
You're just like his mother,

08:51.147 --> 08:52.974
And he loved
his mother.

08:52.976 --> 08:55.287
Doesn't everyone
love their mother?

08:55.289 --> 08:57.856
Some mothers
are impossible to love.

08:57.858 --> 08:59.943
They don't act like
mothers at all.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.851
Have christopher read
the twins a story,

09:05.853 --> 09:07.328
And put this in
the mailbox for tomorrow.

09:07.330 --> 09:09.351
Another one?
But you already sent--

09:09.353 --> 09:11.118
It's late.
You should finish your homework.

09:28.908 --> 09:32.408
Cathy, christopher!
Come inside, now.

09:34.335 --> 09:36.389
You know
all those letters I sent?

09:36.391 --> 09:38.476
Well, I finally got a response.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.435
It's all working out
as I'd hoped.

09:40.437 --> 09:42.104
We can go live with
your grandmother,

09:42.106 --> 09:43.068
In virginia.

09:43.070 --> 09:44.095
What grandmother?

09:44.097 --> 09:45.251
You and dad said

09:45.253 --> 09:46.729
That we never
had any family.

09:46.730 --> 09:47.692
Well...

09:47.694 --> 09:48.945
It's complicated.

09:48.947 --> 09:50.872
My parents and I,
we didn't see eye-to-eye,

09:50.873 --> 09:53.729
So we thought it was best
to keep our distance,

09:53.731 --> 09:55.688
But with your father gone,

09:55.690 --> 09:57.454
This is our best hope
for now.

09:57.456 --> 09:58.931
What about school?

09:58.933 --> 10:00.472
And all
of our friends?

10:00.474 --> 10:02.206
My ballet classes?

10:02.208 --> 10:04.582
You two are old enough
to understand,

10:04.584 --> 10:06.574
To help your mother
out of a desperate situation.

10:06.575 --> 10:08.404
But we still
have the house,

10:08.406 --> 10:10.170
And I can get a part-time job,

10:10.172 --> 10:11.390
Cathy can help out more
with the twins.

10:11.392 --> 10:13.060
[corrine sighs]

10:14.666 --> 10:17.651
People have
a way of believing

10:17.653 --> 10:18.872
That nothing bad
can ever happen.

10:18.874 --> 10:20.670
And your father
was doing so well

10:20.672 --> 10:22.886
At his job, so...

10:22.888 --> 10:24.812
We charged
against our future.

10:24.814 --> 10:27.542
What do you mean?

10:27.544 --> 10:29.501
Nothing here
is really ours.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.327
Not the furniture,
the cars, your toys...

10:32.328 --> 10:35.248
N-not even
this necklace.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.918
It's been four months,

10:36.920 --> 10:38.363
And I've been
holding them at bay,

10:38.365 --> 10:40.868
But the bank is gonna
come and take it all away.

10:40.869 --> 10:42.859
Look, I know it sounds scary,

10:42.861 --> 10:45.074
But I've saved the best news
for last.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.451
My family is rich.

10:47.453 --> 10:49.955
Not middle-class rich,
but unbelievably wealthy,

10:49.957 --> 10:52.460
And they have one of the finest
homes in all of virginia,

10:52.462 --> 10:53.648
With servants,

10:53.650 --> 10:55.415
And acres of land,
and their very own lake.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.438
Wait till we tell
everyone at school.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.235
We leave tonight.

10:59.237 --> 11:00.328
Tonight?

11:00.330 --> 11:02.896
It's our only choice.

11:02.898 --> 11:04.052
I know it's hard,

11:04.054 --> 11:05.979
But I promise you,

11:05.981 --> 11:07.199
Whatever you leave behind,

11:07.201 --> 11:09.704
I'll buy you a thousand more
in virginia.

11:09.706 --> 11:10.667
You won't miss a thing.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.080
Don't worry, mom.

11:12.082 --> 11:13.846
We're dollangangers.

11:13.848 --> 11:16.447
We'll be happy wherever.

11:16.449 --> 11:18.566
I knew I could count
on you, christopher.

11:27.108 --> 11:28.360
And one more thing...

11:28.362 --> 11:30.319
Our name
isn't really dollanganger.

11:30.321 --> 11:32.246
It's foxworth.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.663
[train rumbling over tracks]

11:39.665 --> 11:41.398
[christopher]:
I bet the house is huge.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.874
I mean, you could have
your own dance studio

11:42.876 --> 11:44.865
With costumes
and a grand piano.

11:44.867 --> 11:47.178
I wouldn't even
hear you.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.585
You'll be out exploring
the woods and the lake.

11:49.587 --> 11:52.219
Way better
than any boring biology class.

11:52.220 --> 11:54.241
Ma'am?

11:54.243 --> 11:56.007
We'll reach your depot
in a few minutes.

11:56.009 --> 11:57.742
Thank you.

11:57.743 --> 11:59.091
You're sure
you wouldn't rather

11:59.093 --> 12:00.792
Get off
in charlottesville?

12:00.794 --> 12:01.787
It's 3:00 a.M.,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.072
In the middle
of nowhere.

12:03.074 --> 12:05.930
Oh, thank you.
We have someone meeting us.

12:05.932 --> 12:08.371
Just the children's bag.

12:08.373 --> 12:10.233
Someone will
pick up mine tomorrow.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.320
Thank you.

12:15.115 --> 12:16.237
Have a good night.

12:16.239 --> 12:18.357
Godspeed,
mrs. Patterson.

12:24.941 --> 12:27.091
[engine chugging]

12:29.416 --> 12:31.407
I thought you said

12:31.607 --> 12:33.211
There was someone
meeting us.

12:33.213 --> 12:35.202
We should be there
before the sun breaks.

12:35.204 --> 12:37.321
It's a long walk.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.573
How long?

12:38.575 --> 12:40.146
I can't carry
the twins.

12:40.148 --> 12:41.239
Well, let them walk.

12:41.241 --> 12:43.679
The country air
will do them good.

12:53.028 --> 12:56.788
[carrie]: Where are we going?
I wanna go back home now!

12:56.988 --> 12:59.876
Just a little further,
and everything will be alright.

12:59.878 --> 13:01.032
You really think so?

13:01.034 --> 13:03.987
Yes. If that's
what mom said.

13:17.346 --> 13:19.335
This is
foxworth hall.

13:37.255 --> 13:40.305
Okay, cory,
blow your nose, okay?

13:42.008 --> 13:43.900
Okay. Good. Good.

13:43.902 --> 13:46.084
Okay, cathy,
button this button.

13:47.787 --> 13:49.584
[door creaks open]

13:50.461 --> 13:51.634
Hello, mother.

13:59.475 --> 14:00.740
Well...

14:00.940 --> 14:03.828
Look what the cat dragged in.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.292
Shh.

15:13.549 --> 15:14.735
Thank you for
taking us in, mother.

15:14.935 --> 15:16.474
I don't know
what we would've done.

15:16.476 --> 15:17.951
I'm not your father, corrine.

15:17.953 --> 15:19.717
Your groveling
has always bored me.

15:19.719 --> 15:23.667
I see your children
have inherited your good looks.

15:23.668 --> 15:27.327
I just hope there's
no hidden defect or affliction.

15:27.329 --> 15:31.053
I didn't agree
to run a circus here.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.300
My children are perfect,
physically and mentally.

15:33.302 --> 15:35.901
They just need some rest.

15:41.778 --> 15:44.924
Well, the two older children
can't share a bed.

15:46.128 --> 15:47.829
Cathy and christopher
are children.

15:47.831 --> 15:49.048
They're innocent.

15:49.050 --> 15:52.324
Yes. That's what
I used to presume about you.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.796
Well, if you're so worried,

15:54.798 --> 15:56.530
Why don't you put them
in a separate room?

15:56.532 --> 15:57.590
Heaven knows
there's enough here.

15:57.592 --> 15:58.714
No, this is the only safe room

15:58.716 --> 16:00.288
Where your father
can't hear them.

16:01.444 --> 16:03.916
Put the two girls in one bed

16:04.120 --> 16:06.667
And the two boys
in the other one.

16:10.707 --> 16:11.900
And when your mother and I
leave here,

16:12.100 --> 16:15.084
I will lock this room
from the outside,

16:15.086 --> 16:17.749
And you will
keep the drapes closed.

16:17.751 --> 16:19.419
And remember...

16:19.421 --> 16:21.956
God sees everything.

16:21.958 --> 16:26.195
God sees what evil
you do behind my back.

16:27.512 --> 16:30.561
I'll wait for you
out in the hall.

16:30.563 --> 16:32.360
[footsteps recede]

16:32.362 --> 16:34.061
[door opens and closes]

16:38.109 --> 16:40.098
Grandfather doesn't
know we're here?

16:41.192 --> 16:43.759
I'm sorry, I should've
told you the truth,

16:43.761 --> 16:46.874
But I didn't want you
to be frightened.

16:47.935 --> 16:51.273
When I was 18, I did something
my parents didn't approve of,

16:51.275 --> 16:53.104
So my father
wrote me out of his will.

16:53.106 --> 16:54.581
Is that why she hates us?

16:54.583 --> 16:56.186
She doesn't
hate you.

16:56.188 --> 16:57.375
She's just jealous

16:57.377 --> 16:59.172
Of how much I love
you guys and your dad,

16:59.174 --> 17:01.388
How much my father
used to love me.

17:01.390 --> 17:04.791
That's why we're here.
I'm gonna win him back.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.204
He's gonna put us
in his will.

17:06.205 --> 17:08.613
He's 78 years old
and he's dying,

17:08.615 --> 17:10.667
And I just need a little time
alone to reconnect with him.

17:10.670 --> 17:11.825
How much time?

17:11.827 --> 17:12.788
I don't know exactly.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.650
Maybe a few days
or a week?

17:14.652 --> 17:16.608
And when I win my father over,

17:16.611 --> 17:18.503
I'm gonna take you all
down to meet him,

17:18.506 --> 17:20.397
And I know he'll love each
and every one of you

17:20.400 --> 17:21.425
Just as much as I do.

17:21.426 --> 17:22.549
We'll be fine up here.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.925
We're foxworths.

17:24.926 --> 17:26.789
[relieved sigh]

17:28.170 --> 17:29.999
And tomorrow,

17:30.001 --> 17:31.155
I'll bring toys and games,

17:31.157 --> 17:32.922
And I'll come visit you
as much as I can.

17:32.924 --> 17:34.688
And just whatever you do,

17:34.690 --> 17:36.775
Don't make your grandmother
angry, okay?

17:37.836 --> 17:38.958
Corrine!

17:38.960 --> 17:42.362
What is that
on that child's hand?

17:42.364 --> 17:44.321
It's a promise ring,
from my father.

17:44.323 --> 17:46.536
Give it to me.

17:46.538 --> 17:49.009
Mom, she can't.

17:49.011 --> 17:50.358
Dad gave it to me.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.449
I said, give it
to me, girl!

17:54.340 --> 17:57.679
Or must I speak
more...

17:57.681 --> 17:59.927
Slowly?

18:11.968 --> 18:14.591
And don't you ever mention
your father in this house again.

18:14.791 --> 18:16.974
[huffs] come on, corrine,
that's enough.

18:16.976 --> 18:18.547
[whispers]: I'm sorry.

18:18.549 --> 18:20.539
I promise, all our dreams
are gonna come true.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.626
Just trust me.

18:22.628 --> 18:24.553
[smooch]

18:24.555 --> 18:25.644
[smooch]

18:58.944 --> 19:00.228
[cory]: Where's the sun?

19:00.230 --> 19:01.191
Is it still night?

19:01.193 --> 19:02.122
Cory! Don't.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.728
Your food.

19:13.298 --> 19:15.256
Uh! Uh-uh-uh.
Get your hands off that.

19:15.258 --> 19:17.568
That food has to last you
the entire day.

19:17.569 --> 19:19.526
I can't be running
up and down the stairs.

19:19.528 --> 19:22.512
The servants
might get suspicious.

19:22.514 --> 19:26.173
There'll be eggs for breakfast,
sandwiches for lunch,

19:26.175 --> 19:27.297
And chicken for dinner,

19:27.299 --> 19:28.839
And I want you
to eat all of it.

19:28.841 --> 19:31.150
Don't waste one bite of it,
you understand?

19:32.597 --> 19:34.009
And if you're very good,

19:34.011 --> 19:35.935
I may bring you
some fruit.

19:35.937 --> 19:37.091
Thank you.

19:38.569 --> 19:42.389
I've written out
a list of other rules.

19:42.589 --> 19:45.413
First of all, you'll keep
this room neat and tidy,

19:45.415 --> 19:47.501
As if nobody lived here.

19:47.503 --> 19:49.491
Keep your hair brushed neatly,

19:49.493 --> 19:53.377
And your bodies clean
and fully clothed.

19:53.379 --> 19:56.203
And be modest
when you go to the bathroom.

19:56.204 --> 20:00.666
Girls and boys are never to use
the bathroom at the same time.

20:02.144 --> 20:05.129
You older children will
keep the younger ones quiet.

20:05.131 --> 20:07.923
No running around
or yelling or crying,

20:07.925 --> 20:09.850
They're good kids,

20:09.852 --> 20:12.322
But they need somewhere
to play and make noise.

20:12.324 --> 20:15.437
Ah. Over here, there's a...

20:15.439 --> 20:17.107
Stairway.

20:17.109 --> 20:19.258
Leads up to the attic.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.024
You want us
to play in an attic?

20:21.026 --> 20:23.047
Up there,
there will be ample room.

20:23.049 --> 20:26.098
And, the last Friday
of every month,

20:26.100 --> 20:28.571
You're to clean out
all of your things

20:28.573 --> 20:29.823
And hide up there

20:29.825 --> 20:30.979
While the maids
are cleaning this room.

20:32.521 --> 20:36.341
No one must ever see
or hear you.

20:36.343 --> 20:38.428
Do you understand?

20:39.553 --> 20:41.350
Good.

20:41.352 --> 20:45.974
Because if your grandfather ever
discovered that you're here,

20:45.976 --> 20:48.897
You'd all be thrown out
without a red cent,

20:48.899 --> 20:52.782
But not before getting punished
for even being alive.

21:37.770 --> 21:38.629
Carrie...

21:38.829 --> 21:40.754
You can dress up
for days in here.

21:40.756 --> 21:42.455
Hey, cor',
check it out.

21:42.457 --> 21:44.478
You finally get
your own record player.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.020
But it doesn't
have a plug.

21:46.022 --> 21:47.433
You just have to crank it.

21:49.199 --> 21:51.864
[music begins to crackle]

21:52.957 --> 21:55.685
Better hope you inherit
from this half of the gene pool.

21:55.687 --> 21:58.639
Like you
know anything.

21:58.641 --> 22:01.818
[d]

22:01.820 --> 22:03.713
Our entire family.

22:03.715 --> 22:06.507
They're all grumpy!
Like our grandma.

22:06.509 --> 22:08.530
They're not grumpy.

22:08.532 --> 22:10.488
Guys! You gotta
come check this out.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.736
[d]

22:16.975 --> 22:19.801
Looks we weren't
the first kids up here.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.204
[carrie]:
It's hot and dusty.

22:23.206 --> 22:24.618
I don't like it.

22:24.619 --> 22:25.773
It's not so bad.

22:25.775 --> 22:27.443
I wanna go outside
in the garden.

22:27.445 --> 22:28.534
This is a bad place.

22:28.536 --> 22:29.658
I want mama!

22:29.660 --> 22:32.388
Okay, we're gonna
make this a game.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.411
Pretend
we're outside.

22:34.412 --> 22:35.631
The floor can
be the garden,

22:35.633 --> 22:37.686
And the ceiling
can be the sky,

22:37.688 --> 22:40.159
And I'll even
make a swing.

22:45.073 --> 22:47.127
What do you think
she meant,

22:47.129 --> 22:50.820
Grandfather punishing us
for even being alive?

22:50.822 --> 22:52.136
She's just
trying to scare us.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.934
Then how come she said
we'd be here for months?

22:53.936 --> 22:55.411
Quit worrying.

22:55.413 --> 22:57.338
Mom's gonna take care of us.

23:06.378 --> 23:07.302
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

23:11.082 --> 23:12.208
See? It worked.

23:12.408 --> 23:14.687
Cory, carrie,
come try this out.

23:22.587 --> 23:24.738
I'm telling you,
the week's gonna fly by.

23:24.740 --> 23:28.207
Mom's gonna win over her dad
and we'll all be rich.

23:28.209 --> 23:31.160
We'll never have to
see this attic again.

23:33.474 --> 23:36.106
This is cold and greasy!
I don't like it.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.968
Cripes, carrie.
This is all we have.

23:37.970 --> 23:39.253
No!

23:39.255 --> 23:40.280
I don't
like this either.

23:40.282 --> 23:42.624
Children, enough.

23:45.483 --> 23:47.409
Wasting food...

23:47.411 --> 23:49.624
Is the devil's work.

23:50.814 --> 23:55.437
If you leave so much
as one bite of your food...

23:55.439 --> 23:57.042
God will tell me--

23:57.044 --> 23:58.037
[giggling]

23:58.039 --> 23:59.354
...And you will be punished

23:59.356 --> 24:02.212
And sent
to the bowels of hell!

24:02.214 --> 24:03.850
[laughing]

24:06.163 --> 24:07.639
Mommy!

24:07.641 --> 24:08.602
Oh, mom. Sorry.

24:08.604 --> 24:09.983
We were just
goofing around.

24:09.985 --> 24:12.102
[cathy]: He was trying
to get the twins to eat.

24:12.104 --> 24:13.804
Oh, kids, what did I tell you?

24:13.806 --> 24:15.634
I just, um...

24:15.636 --> 24:17.337
Oh, mother. Um...

24:17.339 --> 24:20.484
Don't be mad.
It's not their fault.

24:20.485 --> 24:22.570
They didn't
properly understand.

24:24.241 --> 24:26.135
They will.

24:39.944 --> 24:42.768
[door creaking]

24:47.554 --> 24:49.127
Mom?

24:49.128 --> 24:50.314
You okay?

24:50.316 --> 24:52.980
I just wanted to come
say goodnight.

24:54.971 --> 24:57.989
How was your first day?
It wasn't so bad, was it?

24:57.991 --> 25:00.750
Mommy, we don't
like it here.

25:00.752 --> 25:02.003
It's not nice.

25:02.005 --> 25:03.094
Carrie, stop.

25:03.096 --> 25:05.984
No. Cathy and christopher
are mean.

25:05.986 --> 25:07.622
We wanna go home.

25:07.624 --> 25:08.617
[cory]:
With you, mama.

25:08.619 --> 25:09.613
We want you.

25:09.615 --> 25:11.540
I'm sorry, darlings,

25:11.542 --> 25:14.205
It's just, for now,

25:14.207 --> 25:16.196
You have to listen to
your older brother and sister,

25:16.198 --> 25:17.352
Like they're parents.

25:17.354 --> 25:18.347
No!

25:18.349 --> 25:21.205
Take us out of here. Now!

25:21.207 --> 25:22.939
Corrine!

25:22.941 --> 25:25.765
Stop that child from screaming
right now.

25:25.767 --> 25:27.081
[shrieks]

25:28.752 --> 25:29.907
Ow! Get away from me!

25:29.909 --> 25:31.834
Get! Get off!

25:31.835 --> 25:33.760
Stop yelling!
They're only five.

25:33.762 --> 25:35.302
Take off your blouse
and show them

25:35.304 --> 25:37.325
How bad behavior is
dealt with in this house.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.220
You can do whatever
you want to me,

25:39.222 --> 25:40.600
But you can't be
cruel to my children,

25:40.602 --> 25:42.206
Or we'll leave tonight,

25:42.208 --> 25:44.196
And you'll never see them,
or me, ever again.

25:44.198 --> 25:46.059
[chuckles dryly]

25:46.061 --> 25:48.018
Go!

25:52.739 --> 25:54.665
[grandmother resumes chuckling]

25:56.881 --> 25:59.609
Now take off
your blouse.

26:00.671 --> 26:02.597
[roars]: Do it!

26:05.584 --> 26:09.147
Take a good long look, children,

26:09.148 --> 26:12.422
At what happens
when you disobey me.

26:12.424 --> 26:14.285
18 lashes,

26:14.287 --> 26:17.110
For every year she used
her wicked charms

26:17.112 --> 26:18.780
On my husband!

26:18.782 --> 26:21.092
And 20 more

26:21.094 --> 26:24.560
For every year she lived in sin
with your father.

26:24.562 --> 26:26.486
A marriage
that was an abomination

26:26.488 --> 26:28.509
In the eyes of the lord,

26:28.511 --> 26:30.469
With four children

26:30.471 --> 26:32.170
Spawned by the devil!

26:32.172 --> 26:34.258
Evil...

26:34.260 --> 26:37.244
From the moment
you were conceived.

26:37.246 --> 26:39.139
Evil!

26:42.383 --> 26:45.015
I make the rules
in this house.

26:46.673 --> 26:47.832
I do!

26:50.434 --> 26:51.651
And I execute the punishment.

27:07.692 --> 27:08.352
[door creaks]

27:12.103 --> 27:13.329
Figured since I couldn't
get you a real garden,

27:13.529 --> 27:15.742
That you could build
a garden in the attic.

27:15.744 --> 27:16.737
What about
grandmother?

27:16.739 --> 27:18.183
Won't she punish us?

27:18.185 --> 27:20.527
She's claustrophobic.

27:20.529 --> 27:22.743
She'll never
climb the stairs.

27:25.300 --> 27:25.430
[exhales sharply]

27:26.032 --> 27:27.314
You should take it easy. Mom.

27:27.514 --> 27:28.797
It's okay.

27:28.799 --> 27:30.274
It's just
a willow switching.

27:30.275 --> 27:32.971
My pride hurts
worse than my back.

27:32.973 --> 27:35.315
But why?

27:35.317 --> 27:37.917
Why did grandmother say
those things about daddy?

27:37.919 --> 27:39.490
About us?

27:41.065 --> 27:42.733
When I was little,

27:42.735 --> 27:44.884
I turned to
my father for love.

27:44.886 --> 27:46.554
We did everything
together.

27:46.556 --> 27:48.738
Sailing
and horseback-riding,

27:48.739 --> 27:50.664
Even hunting.

27:50.666 --> 27:54.357
That only made my mother
more jealous.

27:54.359 --> 27:56.316
And she took every
opportunity she could

27:56.318 --> 27:58.147
To torment me
and shame me,

27:58.149 --> 27:59.624
And she succeeded.

27:59.626 --> 28:00.972
Over the years,

28:00.974 --> 28:02.096
My father became more
and more busy with work,

28:02.098 --> 28:03.990
And I became

28:03.992 --> 28:06.013
More withdrawn
and lonely.

28:06.015 --> 28:10.574
And into all this came
my father's half-brother.

28:10.576 --> 28:13.688
His mother had recently died
and my family took him in.

28:13.690 --> 28:16.450
He was only
a few years older than me.

28:16.452 --> 28:21.106
He was so handsome
and so kind, and, uh...

28:21.108 --> 28:22.390
So full of life.

28:22.392 --> 28:23.835
[sad chuckle]

28:23.837 --> 28:26.372
My father treated him
like he was his own son,

28:26.374 --> 28:28.299
And I'd never met
anyone like him.

28:31.478 --> 28:32.698
[sighs]

28:32.699 --> 28:35.684
You're talking about dad?

28:39.475 --> 28:41.624
We tried to keep
our feelings secret,

28:41.626 --> 28:43.616
Even from each other.

28:43.618 --> 28:45.574
I mean, we were
related by blood.

28:45.576 --> 28:46.602
He was my half-uncle.

28:46.604 --> 28:48.368
And when we eloped,

28:48.370 --> 28:51.387
My family flew into a rage
and my father disinherited me,

28:51.389 --> 28:52.928
And my mother said

28:52.929 --> 28:54.887
That my children would be
born with hooved feet

28:54.889 --> 28:56.814
And forked tails.

28:56.815 --> 28:58.900
She was wrong.

28:58.902 --> 29:00.859
God didn't punish me,
not with you.

29:00.861 --> 29:02.818
You are perfect.

29:02.820 --> 29:05.419
You have to believe it,
no matter what anyone says.

29:05.421 --> 29:06.800
I hope you can understand

29:06.802 --> 29:10.653
That love doesn't always come
when you want it.

29:10.655 --> 29:14.474
Sometimes it just happens,
against your will.

29:16.209 --> 29:19.130
I don't care what you did, mom,
or do.

29:20.608 --> 29:22.084
I'll always love you.

29:25.489 --> 29:28.443
Why did grandmother
let you come back?

29:28.445 --> 29:29.727
Because she's been
waiting 20 years

29:29.728 --> 29:31.590
To say
"I told you so."

29:31.592 --> 29:33.548
Trust me, cathy,

29:33.550 --> 29:36.534
I'm as much a captive
of this place as you are.

29:43.761 --> 29:45.140
Hey, cor'.

29:45.142 --> 29:46.617
That's a great...

29:46.619 --> 29:48.063
It's a snail.

29:48.065 --> 29:50.407
I can't wait to show it
to mama when she comes.

29:51.884 --> 29:53.617
If she comes.

29:53.619 --> 29:54.967
She's only missed
a few days.

29:54.969 --> 29:55.897
A week.

29:55.899 --> 29:57.696
I've made a calendar.

30:09.449 --> 30:12.178
You gonna help out
with the garden or what?

30:12.180 --> 30:14.843
We need water.

30:20.367 --> 30:22.903
Watch where you're going!

30:22.905 --> 30:25.247
Why are you
in such a hurry?

30:25.249 --> 30:27.591
Sorry, I-I just had to
get some more water

30:27.593 --> 30:29.678
For christopher
before the paint dries.

30:29.680 --> 30:30.930
The paint?

30:30.932 --> 30:32.408
We're building
a garden,

30:32.409 --> 30:33.467
In the attic,

30:33.469 --> 30:35.427
So the twins
won't be so scared.

30:35.428 --> 30:37.160
Was this
your mother's idea?

30:38.285 --> 30:41.463
Hope you didn't inherit
her artistic abilities.

30:41.465 --> 30:45.702
The only real talent
corrine ever had was...

30:45.704 --> 30:48.303
For the opposite sex.

30:49.621 --> 30:52.606
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ballet.

30:52.608 --> 30:54.532
And christopher's
a really good artist.

30:54.534 --> 30:55.688
He can paint anything.

30:55.690 --> 30:57.840
Has he ever
painted you?

30:59.511 --> 31:01.180
Has he asked you
to pose for him

31:01.181 --> 31:02.785
With your clothes off?

31:02.787 --> 31:04.647
Come on, girl!

31:04.649 --> 31:06.124
Spill out the truth!

31:06.126 --> 31:08.180
I want to know what kind of
wickedness you're up to!

31:08.182 --> 31:10.074
Nothing.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.776
Nothing?

31:11.778 --> 31:13.413
Why are you trembling?

31:13.415 --> 31:16.240
Because you keep accusing us
of doing all these bad things,

31:16.242 --> 31:18.583
And I don't even know
what you're talking about.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.156
[scoffs bitterly]

31:20.158 --> 31:21.987
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

31:21.989 --> 31:24.427
Ask your brother!

31:24.429 --> 31:27.349
He'll know.

31:27.351 --> 31:28.410
By the time they're born,

31:28.412 --> 31:30.657
The male of the species

31:30.659 --> 31:33.996
They know all about
wickedness...

31:35.443 --> 31:37.337
Evil.

31:43.149 --> 31:45.685
Right. Now, make sure
that you take all of your toys.

31:45.687 --> 31:47.644
Check under the beds.
Make sure.

31:47.646 --> 31:49.474
I don't want
any trace of you here.

31:49.476 --> 31:51.818
Why don't you take this?

31:54.678 --> 31:56.346
Why does this table
look polished?

31:56.348 --> 32:00.810
The room can't look
like it's just been dusted!

32:00.812 --> 32:03.347
The maids are gonna be here
in less than an hour.

32:03.349 --> 32:05.980
Alright, never mind.
I'll take care of it.

32:05.982 --> 32:07.713
Uh--

32:09.159 --> 32:13.622
Here are some real flowers
for your fake garden.

32:15.577 --> 32:16.410
Just go.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.196
"see jane run.

32:31.198 --> 32:32.057
Run, jane, run."

32:33.659 --> 32:34.163
Now you try.

32:34.363 --> 32:35.741
No!

32:35.743 --> 32:38.631
We've already read it
a kazillion times.

32:38.633 --> 32:40.815
[cathy]: If you guys
play nicely tonight,

32:40.817 --> 32:42.806
We can go on the roof
tomorrow morning.

32:42.808 --> 32:44.348
[cory]:
I don't wanna go on the roof.

32:44.350 --> 32:45.664
Mom!

32:45.666 --> 32:48.425
We missed you so much!

32:48.427 --> 32:51.091
I'm sorry I've kept you
waiting so long, darlings,

32:51.093 --> 32:52.824
But here's some games,

32:52.826 --> 32:54.591
And the paints
you asked for, cathy.

32:54.593 --> 32:55.971
Where have you been?

32:55.973 --> 32:58.798
I wanted
to come earlier, but...

32:58.800 --> 33:01.045
I've had to spend every moment
with my father.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.293
You have no idea
how hard it's been on me.

33:03.295 --> 33:04.674
Today, I finally

33:04.676 --> 33:05.894
Just had a chance
to go sailing on the lake.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.531
You went sailing?

33:07.533 --> 33:09.426
You got some great
color, mom.

33:09.626 --> 33:11.519
Can you stay for
the twins' bedtime?

33:11.521 --> 33:13.606
[twins cheering]:
Yeah! Stay! Stay!

33:13.608 --> 33:16.368
I have a movie date
with an old friend.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.428
She keeps
asking me out

33:17.430 --> 33:20.350
But I would much rather
be with you guys!

33:20.351 --> 33:23.304
Then why aren't you downstairs
telling your father about us?

33:23.306 --> 33:25.166
Well, cathy, I have to time it
very carefully.

33:25.168 --> 33:26.161
I only just got back.

33:26.163 --> 33:27.542
It's been a month!

33:30.267 --> 33:31.053
And I'm sick of
being in here.

33:31.253 --> 33:34.531
The twins need
fresh air and sunshine.

33:34.731 --> 33:37.040
I want to go sailing!

33:37.042 --> 33:38.453
Stop picking
on mom, cathy.

33:38.455 --> 33:40.187
I just want to know when.

33:40.189 --> 33:42.210
When are you going to tell
your father about us?

33:42.212 --> 33:43.976
When do we get to leave?

33:43.978 --> 33:45.196
Like I said,

33:45.198 --> 33:46.995
My father has just
finally accepted me back.

33:46.997 --> 33:49.467
Then why can't he accept us?

33:49.469 --> 33:53.481
Are we so terrible,
or stupid, or ugly,

33:53.483 --> 33:56.564
That he wouldn't want to meet
his own grandchildren?

33:58.395 --> 34:00.545
I can't.

34:02.506 --> 34:04.945
I can't tell him
about you, ever.

34:04.947 --> 34:07.225
My father forgave me
on one condition--

34:07.227 --> 34:10.308
That I didn't have any children
with your father.

34:15.190 --> 34:16.858
You know what?

34:16.860 --> 34:18.045
I'll cancel
my movie date,

34:16.351 --> 34:18.966
And I'll stay here
with you and the twins.

34:19.166 --> 34:21.091
It's okay, mom.

34:22.119 --> 34:23.981
You go.

34:23.983 --> 34:27.351
We'll be fine here.

34:43.312 --> 34:45.237
He could go
any day now.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.614
That's how
heart disease works.

34:47.616 --> 34:49.509
A blood clot
could break free

34:49.511 --> 34:51.692
And find its way
to his lungs or heart,

34:51.694 --> 34:53.587
Snuff him out
like a candle.

34:53.589 --> 34:56.156
With our luck,
grandfather will never die.

34:56.158 --> 34:57.761
We'll be stuck
up here forever.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.233
What's few more weeks?
A month, even?

35:00.235 --> 35:01.614
Pretty soon,

35:01.616 --> 35:02.835
We're gonna be
worth millions.

35:02.837 --> 35:04.761
Mom already acts
like she is.

35:04.763 --> 35:05.982
Have you noticed

35:05.984 --> 35:07.074
How she's always
in a new outfit?

35:07.076 --> 35:08.487
She's a foxworth.

35:08.489 --> 35:10.317
She has to fit in
around here.

35:10.319 --> 35:11.858
Cory's a cheater!

35:11.860 --> 35:14.652
I thought you guys were
playing hide-and-seek.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.161
We were!

35:16.163 --> 35:17.220
But I called and called
and he won't come out.

35:21.172 --> 35:22.744
Cory!

35:22.746 --> 35:24.414
Where are you?

35:28.878 --> 35:30.194
Christopher.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.864
Over here.

35:35.332 --> 35:36.680
[thud]

35:47.502 --> 35:50.038
It's gonna be okay.

35:50.040 --> 35:51.868
We just need to get him
warmed up.

36:09.562 --> 36:11.553
Cathy?

36:12.613 --> 36:14.828
I miss mama so much.

36:14.829 --> 36:17.140
Pretend I'm your mom.

36:17.142 --> 36:20.158
I love you so much.

36:20.160 --> 36:22.020
That's what makes
a real mother.

36:29.580 --> 36:30.510
[footsteps]

37:05.801 --> 37:08.629
Our first christmas
without dad.

37:11.929 --> 37:13.818
Remember how
he used to take us sledding

37:14.018 --> 37:16.107
Behind the flanagans'?

37:16.109 --> 37:18.997
He was always
running alongside us,

37:18.999 --> 37:22.048
Making sure
the twins were safe.

37:25.100 --> 37:27.507
One christmas
up here won't matter.

37:27.509 --> 37:30.012
And we can make our own
presents for the twins.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.456
Say it's from santa.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.865
We could make something
for grandmother, too.

37:33.867 --> 37:36.113
She does bring us
food every day.

37:36.115 --> 37:38.072
She got us that plant.

37:38.074 --> 37:41.507
She might even let us out.

37:48.095 --> 37:49.412
Hurry, cathy!

37:49.414 --> 37:50.407
She's gonna
be here.

37:50.409 --> 37:52.398
Careful.
I don't want it to rip.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.746
Christopher,
can I have the card?

37:53.748 --> 37:55.898
It has to be perfect.

38:02.505 --> 38:03.152
Grandmother?

38:36.056 --> 38:39.981
Cathy! Cathy!
Wake up. Santa came!

38:43.471 --> 38:44.211
This gift
is not from santa.

38:44.411 --> 38:46.722
It's for cory and carrie
to play pretend house,

38:46.724 --> 38:47.974
Just like I did.

38:47.976 --> 38:49.259
And all the doors and windows
really work

38:49.261 --> 38:50.222
And the locks.

38:53.562 --> 38:55.969
I knew that color
would look perfect on you.

38:55.971 --> 38:58.570
You look just like your father
when I first met him.

38:58.572 --> 39:00.015
You think so?

39:00.017 --> 39:03.997
[d]

39:05.764 --> 39:07.176
I got this
sent from paris.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.038
It's hand-embroidered.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.484
Don't you like it?

39:10.486 --> 39:12.057
Yes.

39:12.059 --> 39:14.818
I just don't know
where I'd wear it.

39:16.329 --> 39:18.094
Well, I know
it's not a perfect christmas,

39:18.096 --> 39:20.406
But I still have
one more trick up my sleeve.

39:23.393 --> 39:25.479
A window
to the outside world.

39:25.481 --> 39:27.182
My father
gave it to me.

39:27.184 --> 39:28.722
But that's not all.

39:28.724 --> 39:30.200
Bart, mr. Winslow,
he says that my father

39:30.202 --> 39:32.255
Has an even bigger
surprise for me.

39:32.257 --> 39:33.668
Who's mr. Winslow?

39:33.670 --> 39:34.985
He's my father's attorney.

39:34.986 --> 39:36.109
He says it's only a matter

39:36.111 --> 39:38.388
Of drawing up
the new paperwork, but...

39:38.390 --> 39:40.315
I'm gonna
inherit everything.

39:40.317 --> 39:42.177
[squeals and laughs]

39:44.651 --> 39:45.742
I knew you could do it, mom.

39:45.744 --> 39:46.962
He's throwing me
a party tonight,

39:46.964 --> 39:48.375
With champagne
and a live orchestra

39:48.377 --> 39:50.012
And anyone who's anyone--

39:50.014 --> 39:51.393
-...In virginia.
-Can we come?

39:52.293 --> 39:54.187
Please?

39:54.189 --> 39:56.724
We'll hide somewhere
and we'll be quiet,

39:56.725 --> 39:58.586
And no one will hear us
or see us, I swear.

39:58.588 --> 39:59.774
I think it's too risky.

39:59.776 --> 40:02.631
I mean, after putting
in all this time...

40:02.633 --> 40:04.911
We haven't seen
other people in so long.

40:06.390 --> 40:08.733
It's the only thing
I really want.

40:08.735 --> 40:10.595
Don't you care
if I'm happy?

40:10.597 --> 40:11.623
Cathy, quit it.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.036
You think she's happy

40:13.038 --> 40:14.063
Knowing her kids
are locked up in an attic?

40:14.065 --> 40:15.155
[sighs]

40:15.157 --> 40:16.825
It's okay, christopher.

40:17.853 --> 40:18.945
You can come.

40:18.947 --> 40:20.711
You can both come.

40:20.712 --> 40:22.926
After the twins
are asleep.

40:22.928 --> 40:25.592
I feel like, for the first time
since your father died,

40:25.594 --> 40:28.578
Things are finally
looking up for us.

40:33.486 --> 40:35.883
This is where I used to hide and
watch my parents' parties.

40:36.083 --> 40:37.397
Just remember
your promise, okay?

40:37.399 --> 40:38.425
Be quiet as mice.

40:38.427 --> 40:39.388
And after dinner,

40:39.390 --> 40:41.347
Go straight back
to our room.

40:41.349 --> 40:42.310
Yes.

41:04.716 --> 41:06.930
The house hasn't been
so lively in years.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.895
And all this
because of you.

41:08.897 --> 41:09.986
That's what worries me.

41:09.988 --> 41:11.495
I hope I don't
disappoint anyone.

41:11.497 --> 41:14.642
Oh, no, miss foxworth,
you're as lovely as ever.

41:14.644 --> 41:16.761
Thank you, sarah.

41:18.304 --> 41:20.069
[background chatter]

41:20.071 --> 41:21.996
That dress...

41:21.997 --> 41:25.399
Most women would be
too modest to wear it.

41:25.401 --> 41:27.326
I know you don't
approve of this party,

41:27.328 --> 41:28.321
But try to have fun,

41:28.323 --> 41:29.702
For father's sake.

41:29.704 --> 41:33.074
Your father's well-being
is my only concern.

41:33.076 --> 41:36.157
It's the one thing
we share.

41:36.159 --> 41:37.538
Merry christmas.

41:37.540 --> 41:38.886
Corrine, this is
all too gorgeous.

41:38.888 --> 41:39.881
I wanted
something simpler,

41:39.883 --> 41:41.262
But my father insisted.

41:41.264 --> 41:42.386
[corrine giggles]

41:42.388 --> 41:45.212
Well, I always told him,
"spare the rod,

41:45.214 --> 41:46.528
And spoil the child."

41:46.530 --> 41:47.942
Mother, please.

41:47.944 --> 41:49.965
Well, she certainly
doesn't look spoiled.

41:53.337 --> 41:54.878
God, I can't
even imagine

41:54.880 --> 41:56.740
Being invited
to a party like this.

41:56.742 --> 41:57.831
You won't have to.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.694
Someday,
it's gonna be our party.

41:59.696 --> 42:01.653
[bustling of guests below]

42:01.655 --> 42:03.579
John, I told
sarah specifically

42:03.581 --> 42:05.731
To serve
the aged bourbon.

42:05.733 --> 42:07.272
I always keep

42:07.274 --> 42:09.359
A few extra bottles
handy up here.

42:09.361 --> 42:11.190
I know how
mr. Foxworth enjoys it.

42:11.192 --> 42:12.089
[quiet gasps]

42:12.091 --> 42:13.566
Oh, never mind.

42:13.568 --> 42:16.520
It'll just make him
fall asleep before dinner.

42:16.522 --> 42:17.869
And john...

42:17.871 --> 42:19.475
Get rid of sarah.

42:19.477 --> 42:20.951
Tonight?

42:20.953 --> 42:23.103
But, ma'am,
it's dead cold out,

42:23.105 --> 42:24.612
And there are no more trains.

42:24.614 --> 42:26.250
Well, then
that will show the servants

42:26.252 --> 42:29.911
What happens
when they don't do as I say.

42:38.549 --> 42:40.668
[d]

42:51.651 --> 42:53.641
[abruptly stops playing]

42:53.643 --> 42:55.760
[party chatter hushes]

42:57.366 --> 42:58.874
Father!

42:58.876 --> 43:01.155
Merry christmas.

43:06.229 --> 43:08.123
[giggles]

43:09.472 --> 43:10.981
[gasps]

43:10.983 --> 43:12.779
It's so beautiful.

43:12.781 --> 43:14.352
I don't deserve that.

43:14.354 --> 43:16.343
It belonged to my mother.

43:16.345 --> 43:19.169
Passed on
from her own mother.

43:19.171 --> 43:21.064
And this...

43:21.066 --> 43:22.861
Is just the beginning.

43:22.863 --> 43:23.954
[deflating sigh]

43:29.995 --> 43:30.903
It's so beautiful.

43:39.586 --> 43:42.040
Maybe someday you'll have
a daughter of your own

43:42.240 --> 43:45.032
That you can
pass it on to.

43:46.959 --> 43:49.366
[faint strains of party below]

43:50.331 --> 43:51.999
Come on, over here.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.811
You're missing
all the fun, mr. Winslow.

44:07.382 --> 44:09.275
Come on, corrine.

44:09.277 --> 44:10.591
Just five minutes alone.

44:10.593 --> 44:12.197
You know
I hate big parties.

44:12.199 --> 44:13.224
I can't, bart.

44:13.226 --> 44:14.638
Everyone's
waiting for me.

44:14.640 --> 44:17.271
You must have a secret.

44:17.273 --> 44:18.266
What?

44:18.268 --> 44:19.936
You're beautiful, smart...

44:19.938 --> 44:21.188
Pretty soon,
you'll be one of

44:21.190 --> 44:22.698
The richest women
in virginia.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.271
That's the least
of your charm.

44:24.273 --> 44:26.518
How are you
so perfect?

44:26.520 --> 44:27.996
Well, I'm far from perfect.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.537
Just ask my mother.

44:29.539 --> 44:32.235
Ah, what does
your mother know?

44:33.295 --> 44:35.734
[giggles awkwardly]

44:35.736 --> 44:40.038
I have to go back and be
the dutiful daughter, remember?

44:40.040 --> 44:42.542
I can't wait to start
our lives together...

44:42.544 --> 44:45.271
Just the two of us.

44:46.429 --> 44:48.098
[cathy whispers]:
Did you hear that?

44:48.100 --> 44:50.281
He said "just the two of us"?

44:50.283 --> 44:51.790
[christopher]: Well,
she's about to inherit millions.

44:51.792 --> 44:53.974
A lot of guys
are gonna be after her.

44:53.976 --> 44:55.932
We should go back
up to the room.

44:55.934 --> 44:57.345
You coming?

44:57.347 --> 44:59.336
No. No, not yet.

45:01.536 --> 45:03.530
I'm gonna explore the house.

45:25.071 --> 45:26.296
[corrine]:
<i>We can't do that, not tonight.</i>

45:29.996 --> 45:30.647
[bart]: I just want
to see this famous "swan bed"

45:28.847 --> 45:29.840
Everybody's talking about.

45:30.040 --> 45:33.033
Nobody's talking
about my bed.

46:11.259 --> 46:12.092
Where's christopher?

46:12.292 --> 46:13.767
Where is
christopher?

46:13.769 --> 46:16.304
I don't know.
He went to look around.

46:16.306 --> 46:18.327
Do you know
what would happen

46:18.329 --> 46:19.675
If anyone found out
about you?

46:19.677 --> 46:22.565
Just when everything
is coming together for me?

46:22.567 --> 46:23.593
Mom, we were quiet.

46:23.595 --> 46:25.873
No one heard us,
I swear.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.189
Just for that, you will never
come out of this room.

46:27.191 --> 46:28.827
Not for any reason!

46:28.829 --> 46:30.175
How can you say that?

46:30.177 --> 46:32.167
You can't keep us
locked in here forever.

46:38.254 --> 46:39.712
If you ever
do that again,

46:39.912 --> 46:41.419
I will whip you!

46:41.421 --> 46:43.314
And cathy, too!

46:52.265 --> 46:53.324
Morning.

46:59.183 --> 47:00.476
What's the matter?

47:00.676 --> 47:03.661
Should I tell santa
to take back all your presents?

47:03.662 --> 47:05.624
Go play.

47:13.865 --> 47:15.891
I'm sorry
about last night.

47:16.091 --> 47:18.112
I didn't mean it,
about the whippings.

47:18.114 --> 47:19.718
Any of it.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.741
I just-- I was scared
that you would get caught

47:21.743 --> 47:23.699
And we would lose everything.

47:24.825 --> 47:26.717
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

47:26.719 --> 47:28.451
You have to
believe me.

47:30.412 --> 47:32.241
What about bart winslow?

47:33.847 --> 47:35.869
We saw you together.

47:35.871 --> 47:37.796
Are you with him?

47:37.798 --> 47:40.140
Well, I-I told you,
he's my father's attorney,

47:40.142 --> 47:42.099
And he's helping us.

47:42.101 --> 47:44.314
You should be glad
that we've become so close.

47:47.334 --> 47:49.774
This is all a mistake.

47:49.775 --> 47:51.057
What?

47:51.059 --> 47:52.150
Coming here.

47:52.152 --> 47:54.430
Look what it's done to you.

47:54.431 --> 47:56.580
To me.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.342
Let's leave, right now.

47:59.344 --> 48:01.654
Start over somewhere else,
without my father's money.

48:01.656 --> 48:03.099
No amount of money is worth

48:03.101 --> 48:04.737
Having my own children
not love me.

48:09.008 --> 48:11.095
Just know that,
if we leave,

48:11.097 --> 48:13.792
We can never
come back.

48:21.518 --> 48:23.875
Of course,
I love you, mom.

49:01.309 --> 49:02.881
<i>[television]:</i>
<i>...A rugged design.</i>

49:03.081 --> 49:04.813
<i>A sturdy,</i>

49:23.632 --> 49:25.397
Hey.
What are you doing up here?

49:25.398 --> 49:26.906
Sorry. I just...

49:26.907 --> 49:30.277
I just realized
we've been here an entire year.

49:32.108 --> 49:33.264
What is that?

49:34.645 --> 49:35.929
It's nothing.

49:37.054 --> 49:38.979
Why do you want to
look at that?

49:38.981 --> 49:40.842
At those women?

49:41.870 --> 49:43.314
Just drop it.

49:45.402 --> 49:47.200
[she sighs]

49:51.086 --> 49:53.365
When men and women
love each other,

49:53.367 --> 49:54.842
They have feelings

49:54.844 --> 49:57.828
In their hearts
as well as their bodies.

49:57.830 --> 49:59.080
See, at your age,
it's natural

49:59.082 --> 50:01.521
That your body
would start changing.

50:01.523 --> 50:03.448
I don't want
my body to change.

50:04.573 --> 50:06.402
Well, you don't
have any choice.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.521
It's nature's way of
making you into a woman.

50:08.523 --> 50:11.604
You don't want to be a child
your whole life, do you?

50:13.050 --> 50:15.137
What about
christopher?

50:15.138 --> 50:17.577
Well, he'll have to
start shaving,

50:17.579 --> 50:20.499
And there's other things
that he'll have to learn.

50:20.501 --> 50:21.943
Like what?

50:21.945 --> 50:22.843
Kissing?

50:24.161 --> 50:26.568
You know, I'll explain it all
to you one day.

50:26.570 --> 50:28.109
But in the meantime,

50:28.111 --> 50:29.458
I brought you all
some new clothes.

50:30.679 --> 50:32.380
And I brought this
specially for you.

50:32.382 --> 50:34.211
You know, you're lucky.

50:34.213 --> 50:36.844
At your age, I had no one
to come to with these questions.

50:39.670 --> 50:41.531
[footsteps receding]

50:57.354 --> 50:59.279
What're you doing?

51:01.396 --> 51:03.068
You look so, uh...

51:09.129 --> 51:10.380
[footsteps]

51:11.280 --> 51:11.702
Ah.

51:12.804 --> 51:14.692
I knew I'd catch you
sooner or later.

51:14.892 --> 51:16.561
We weren't
doing anything.

51:17.845 --> 51:19.996
You think
you look so pretty

51:19.998 --> 51:22.565
In your new young curves

51:22.567 --> 51:24.460
And your long,
golden hair.

51:24.462 --> 51:26.514
[snaps] how many times
have you allowed your brother

51:26.516 --> 51:28.249
To use you?

51:28.251 --> 51:30.175
Use?

51:30.177 --> 51:31.235
What do you mean?

51:31.237 --> 51:32.937
I walked in
on cathy by accident.

51:32.939 --> 51:34.478
We haven't done
anything wrong.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.400
Your sister is almost naked.

51:37.402 --> 51:39.424
And she allowed you
to look upon her body!

51:41.801 --> 51:42.827
Sit down, girl.

51:42.828 --> 51:44.208
What're you doing?

51:44.209 --> 51:46.199
I am going to cut off
your precious hair

51:46.201 --> 51:47.965
Down to the scalp.

51:47.967 --> 51:50.020
Maybe then you won't
feel so much pride

51:50.022 --> 51:51.369
When you look
in the mirror.

51:51.370 --> 51:52.846
[gasps]

51:52.848 --> 51:55.640
You're not gonna cut
one strand of cathy's hair.

51:55.641 --> 51:58.047
Oh?

51:58.049 --> 52:00.552
Alright, then.
Have it your way.

52:00.554 --> 52:02.929
Her hair...

52:02.930 --> 52:05.883
Or the four of you
don't eat for a week.

52:05.885 --> 52:07.906
But the twins...
They didn't do anything.

52:09.577 --> 52:12.658
I think
it'll be your brother

52:12.660 --> 52:14.616
Who will cut off
your precious hair.

52:16.352 --> 52:18.856
Or none of you will eat at all.

52:28.554 --> 52:30.255
I'm still hungry.

52:30.257 --> 52:31.700
Me too.

52:31.702 --> 52:33.627
I want
a sandwich now.

52:33.629 --> 52:35.168
We just need to ration
what we have.

52:35.170 --> 52:37.801
Until mom comes back.

52:37.803 --> 52:39.600
You guys
can have my crackers.

52:57.422 --> 52:59.701
How could
she do this to us?

52:59.702 --> 53:01.756
I don't know.

53:03.812 --> 53:04.967
No!

53:04.969 --> 53:06.508
We're innocent.

53:06.510 --> 53:08.500
She can't control us.
We can't let her.

53:12.674 --> 53:14.793
The twins
don't look good.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.063
I can check the mouse
traps in the attic.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.258
I think it's tar.

54:13.589 --> 54:15.772
It's not coming out.

54:17.089 --> 54:18.662
I tried everything

54:18.664 --> 54:20.910
From the chemistry kit
mom gave me.

54:20.912 --> 54:22.804
You'll have to
use the scissors.

54:23.801 --> 54:26.047
[water splashing]

54:45.530 --> 54:46.819
It wasn't your fault.

54:47.054 --> 54:48.225
All you did
was look at me.

54:50.027 --> 54:51.894
I try so hard
not to think about girls.

54:59.408 --> 55:02.682
I just wish to god
you weren't so...

55:04.476 --> 55:07.723
Close.

55:09.942 --> 55:11.149
Then you do
think of me?

55:13.660 --> 55:15.747
You think I'm pretty?

55:19.376 --> 55:21.301
Yeah. Uh...

55:21.501 --> 55:24.486
You're pretty, but...

55:24.488 --> 55:27.440
Brothers don't think
of their sisters that way.

56:15.915 --> 56:17.469
No way.

56:17.471 --> 56:19.813
I need a dance partner
to do this next move.

56:19.815 --> 56:20.841
I said
I don't dance.

56:22.158 --> 56:23.410
Gimme that.

56:28.517 --> 56:30.153
You jerk!
This is my favorite one.

56:30.155 --> 56:31.951
It's not my fault
you outgrew it.

56:31.952 --> 56:34.970
You're outgrowing
a lot of things.

56:34.971 --> 56:37.153
When are we gonna
outgrow things?

56:39.755 --> 56:42.644
No! I don't
want to go outside!

56:42.646 --> 56:44.603
You guys need fresh air
and sunshine.

56:44.605 --> 56:46.176
It's for
your own good.

56:46.178 --> 56:47.236
No!

56:47.238 --> 56:48.424
Let them go, chris.

56:54.836 --> 56:56.415
They're never gonna grow.

56:56.615 --> 56:58.604
Not in this attic.

56:58.606 --> 56:59.920
Cathy...

57:21.752 --> 57:24.576
We're getting out of here.

58:02.721 --> 58:04.580
Cathy, come on!

58:19.231 --> 58:19.909
[cathy]:
Where do you think mom is?

58:21.666 --> 58:22.492
I don't know.

58:22.692 --> 58:24.489
It's been over a month.

58:24.490 --> 58:27.635
She's never been
gone that long.

58:27.637 --> 58:28.823
Why didn't she tell us
where she was going?

58:28.825 --> 58:30.300
Wherever she is,

58:30.302 --> 58:32.741
I'm sure
she's thinking of us.

58:33.770 --> 58:37.236
Do you still trust her?

58:41.380 --> 58:43.691
I don't even know
what I feel anymore.

58:44.976 --> 58:46.645
I mean, I want
to trust her,

58:46.647 --> 58:48.861
I do, but...

58:48.862 --> 58:51.462
If something
happened to her...

58:51.464 --> 58:53.485
What would
happen to us?

58:55.444 --> 58:57.852
[twig snaps]

59:03.986 --> 59:06.040
She's so beautiful.

59:06.042 --> 59:07.774
Cathy, careful.

59:07.776 --> 59:10.921
[cathy chuckles]

59:10.923 --> 59:12.622
We should get back,

59:12.624 --> 59:14.645
Before the twins
wake up.

59:19.046 --> 59:20.619
He's trapped!
Do something!

59:20.621 --> 59:24.151
Don't let him die!
I want him to be my pet.

59:24.153 --> 59:25.114
Cory, just
don't touch him.

59:25.116 --> 59:26.205
You're mean!

59:26.207 --> 59:27.747
You won't let
cory have anything.

59:32.019 --> 59:34.875
I'm gonna
call him mickey.

59:35.679 --> 59:37.444
Careful, be gentle.

59:37.446 --> 59:39.980
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take good care of you.

59:39.982 --> 59:41.041
I promise.

59:43.385 --> 59:44.541
-[door opens]
-sweeties!

59:44.543 --> 59:47.174
I'm sorry
I was gone so long,

59:47.176 --> 59:49.068
But I have wonderful news!

59:49.070 --> 59:51.284
Is it grandfather?

59:51.286 --> 59:52.632
Is he dead?

59:52.634 --> 59:55.779
Oh, cathy, don't be so morbid.

59:55.781 --> 59:58.283
Do you remember I told you
about my father's attorney?

59:58.285 --> 59:59.921
Bart winslow.

59:59.923 --> 01:00:02.522
Well, we've grown closer
over the past year,

01:00:02.524 --> 01:00:03.678
And we got married.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.124
What?

01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:06.087
When did this happen?

01:00:06.089 --> 01:00:07.082
A few months ago.

01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:08.656
That's why
I was gone so long.

01:00:08.658 --> 01:00:11.257
We just got back from
our honeymoon in europe.

01:00:12.767 --> 01:00:14.243
Well, I thought about you
the whole time.

01:00:14.245 --> 01:00:15.656
I even got you
these beautiful presents.

01:00:15.658 --> 01:00:19.060
This is a boat
and it's called a gondola.

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:24.422
You were wrong
to go away.

01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:26.863
To stay away for so long.
I don't care why.

01:00:28.502 --> 01:00:29.656
Try to be happy
for me.

01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:31.807
I loved your father,
but he's gone.

01:00:31.809 --> 01:00:33.445
I need
someone to love,

01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:35.500
And someone to love me.

01:00:35.502 --> 01:00:36.945
When you're older,
you'll understand.

01:00:36.947 --> 01:00:38.326
We <i>are</i> older, mom!

01:00:38.328 --> 01:00:39.514
Look at us.

01:00:39.516 --> 01:00:41.056
I'm not a kid anymore!

01:00:41.058 --> 01:00:43.239
And cathy, does she even
look like a little girl?

01:00:44.268 --> 01:00:45.551
[chuckles dismissively]

01:00:45.553 --> 01:00:47.157
I know
you're gonna love bart.

01:00:47.159 --> 01:00:48.827
I got you
this magnifying glass.

01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:50.079
It's an antique.

01:00:50.081 --> 01:00:51.813
You said we would be up here
for one night,

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.579
Then a few days, a month--

01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:55.153
It's been more than
two years, mom!

01:00:55.154 --> 01:00:57.464
You think your presents
are gonna make up

01:00:57.466 --> 01:00:59.487
For what we've lost?

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:00.676
What we're losing?

01:01:04.241 --> 01:01:06.456
You have no right
to talk to me like that.

01:01:06.457 --> 01:01:08.704
You agreed to stay here
until my father died.

01:01:08.706 --> 01:01:10.116
I said that I would

01:01:10.118 --> 01:01:11.851
Take care of you,
and I have.

01:01:11.853 --> 01:01:12.910
You have food
and books and toys,

01:01:12.912 --> 01:01:14.451
And a tv set!

01:01:14.453 --> 01:01:16.891
If you can't have pity for us,
think of the twins.

01:01:16.893 --> 01:01:18.818
Mom...

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.906
They don't even know
who you are anymore.

01:01:22.094 --> 01:01:23.764
I'm their mother.

01:01:23.766 --> 01:01:26.654
I'm the only person
who truly loves them.

01:01:28.261 --> 01:01:30.186
All along,
I've only done the best I could.

01:01:30.188 --> 01:01:31.791
You haven't even

01:01:31.793 --> 01:01:33.140
Told bart about us.

01:01:33.142 --> 01:01:34.296
Have you?

01:01:38.021 --> 01:01:40.011
He doesn't even know we exist.

01:01:41.136 --> 01:01:44.604
I never could get anything
past you, could I, cathy?

01:01:48.168 --> 01:01:50.769
[key clatters in lock]

01:01:53.275 --> 01:01:55.425
[door creaks]

01:02:00.756 --> 01:02:02.264
Are these donuts?

01:02:02.266 --> 01:02:04.930
They're from your mother.

01:02:04.932 --> 01:02:07.145
I wouldn't eat 'em,
if I were you.

01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:09.650
They're not good
for your health.

01:02:10.774 --> 01:02:12.829
[door creaks and thuds]

01:02:22.301 --> 01:02:23.709
We could escape,
you know.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:26.665
We could go down
the roof again.

01:02:26.865 --> 01:02:28.534
With the twins.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:29.786
I know they were
scared before,

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:32.193
But if we just
explained it...

01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:34.377
And we can time it out
with the train.

01:02:34.379 --> 01:02:35.951
Don't you think
I know that?

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:36.947
Then why are we
still here?

01:02:36.949 --> 01:02:38.970
All the money
in the world

01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:40.863
Is not worth this.

01:02:42.374 --> 01:02:45.199
[sighs]

01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:48.603
You still believe mom?

01:02:50.755 --> 01:02:53.002
What choice do I have?

01:02:54.865 --> 01:02:56.470
[sighs]

01:02:56.472 --> 01:02:58.332
Besides...

01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:02.506
Where the hell are we supposed
to go from here?

01:03:17.535 --> 01:03:19.622
Step away
from the window, boy.

01:03:19.624 --> 01:03:22.223
My name's not "boy."

01:03:22.225 --> 01:03:24.407
It's christopher.

01:03:25.756 --> 01:03:26.975
What did you say?

01:03:26.977 --> 01:03:28.902
I said my name is christopher.

01:03:28.904 --> 01:03:31.503
The same as my father's.

01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:41.747
Take off
your shirt, boy.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.270
I will whip your sister
and both the twins

01:03:47.272 --> 01:03:48.779
If you don't
take off your shirt.

01:03:56.486 --> 01:03:58.379
Now.

01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:00.756
Take off your shirt.

[whip cracking repeatedly below]

01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:30.620
I was so scared.

I kept thinking,

01:04:34.548 --> 01:04:36.537

happened to you...

I'm right here.

01:05:50.356 --> 01:05:54.988
I know what we did
was wrong,

But I don't care.

didn't it?

What is the meaning of this?

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:04.915
Nothing.

01:06:05.717 --> 01:06:10.476
You were right
about us all along.

01:06:10.676 --> 01:06:13.116
We are the devil's spawn.

Can you ever forgive us?

Only the lord can
forgive you, boy.

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:44.867

to your salvation.

No.

01:06:58.041 --> 01:07:00.223
This is our key.

01:07:12.423 --> 01:07:13.438
This is the master key.

01:07:13.638 --> 01:07:15.274
It should work on all the doors,

01:07:15.276 --> 01:07:16.495
Even the front one.

I wish we could
run away tonight.

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.182
Well, we need money.

01:07:21.184 --> 01:07:22.531
Lots of it.

01:07:22.533 --> 01:07:23.815
So when we escape,

01:07:23.817 --> 01:07:26.063
We can go
wherever we want.

01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:29.628
We can steal...

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.651
From the house.

If grandmother catches us,
she'll whip us.

01:07:35.314 --> 01:07:38.875

01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:53.160
Cathy, you find anything?

01:07:53.162 --> 01:07:55.343
You didn't tell me
there was all this stuff.

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:59.646
Last time I was here,
there wasn't this much stuff.

01:07:59.648 --> 01:08:01.477
How do I look?

01:08:04.894 --> 01:08:05.646
You look ridiculous.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:06.444
Now, uh...

01:08:06.846 --> 01:08:08.430
Take that stuff off
and start looking for cash.

01:08:15.414 --> 01:08:18.880
We can't take too much
or she might notice.

01:08:22.767 --> 01:08:24.756
Cathy, what's the matter?
Are you deaf?

01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:41.227
$30.

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:42.515
That'll barely get us
to the next county.

01:08:42.715 --> 01:08:44.769
We need a thousand.
A-at least.

01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:45.796
That'll take weeks.

01:08:45.798 --> 01:08:47.368
We need to leave now.

01:08:47.371 --> 01:08:50.452
No, not till we have enough
to get away from here.

01:08:52.154 --> 01:08:53.278
Cory?

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.402
Didn't I give you
my extra donut

01:08:54.404 --> 01:08:55.750
If you'd sit still?

01:08:55.752 --> 01:08:57.162
It's mickey.

01:08:57.165 --> 01:08:59.506
He doesn't like
the hammering noises.

01:09:05.801 --> 01:09:07.889
What are they doing?

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:13.669
They're putting up a fence.

01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:19.577
Alright,
you go in without me.

01:09:19.578 --> 01:09:21.568
I need to check
outside.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:22.724
No. What if something
happens to you?

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.296
I have to make sure
we can get out.

01:09:24.299 --> 01:09:26.192
I love you,
christopher doll.

01:09:27.926 --> 01:09:29.466
I love you, too.

01:10:40.466 --> 01:10:42.109
[corrine]:
Bart, you're just careless.

01:10:40.703 --> 01:10:42.500
You can't find your own wallet.

01:10:42.502 --> 01:10:43.785
[bart]: It's not me,
it's the maids.

01:10:43.787 --> 01:10:45.422
I swear I left it
in my black trousers.

01:10:45.424 --> 01:10:46.963
And I think they've been
stealing from us.

01:10:46.965 --> 01:10:48.184
The other day,
I was missing $5.

01:10:48.186 --> 01:10:49.500
Before that,
it was 10.

01:10:49.502 --> 01:10:51.138
$5, $10--
what's the difference?

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.133
You left me alone
at our own dinner party?

01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:53.995
It's not
exactly a party,

01:10:53.997 --> 01:10:55.312
Having to sit across
from your mother.

01:10:55.314 --> 01:10:58.138
I'm sorry. You know
I want to move out of here, too,

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.001
As soon as possible.

01:11:01.383 --> 01:11:03.308
Let's take a trip.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:04.625
Babe, I can't.

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:05.941
You know how busy
work is right now.

01:11:05.943 --> 01:11:07.482
What about
a mini-vacation?

01:11:07.484 --> 01:11:10.372
I know a certain swan bed
that has a vacancy.

01:11:10.374 --> 01:11:11.978
As a matter of fact,

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.194
I had the sweetest dream
earlier there today.

01:11:14.196 --> 01:11:15.318
Really?

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.405
Yeah. A beautiful
young blonde girl

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:20.262
Snuck into the room,
kissed me.

01:11:20.264 --> 01:11:21.483
Right on the lips.

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:23.409
She reminded me
of you,

01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:26.685
But younger,
more innocent.

01:11:26.885 --> 01:11:29.067
Wow. That must've been a dream.

01:11:29.069 --> 01:11:31.829
Why don't we go stay
in a hotel?

01:11:31.831 --> 01:11:34.719
That way, you don't have to see
my mother's face in the morning.

01:11:34.721 --> 01:11:36.517
[bart chuckles]

01:11:47.257 --> 01:11:49.279
How could you be
so careless?

01:11:49.293 --> 01:11:50.575
I'm sorry.

01:11:50.577 --> 01:11:51.538
He was asleep.

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.176
I was curious.

01:11:53.178 --> 01:11:54.428
You kissed that man!

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.162
And he wasn't asleep,
he saw you!

01:11:56.164 --> 01:11:57.543
Mom can't know
we passed through a locked door!

01:11:57.545 --> 01:11:58.988
We don't have enough money yet.

01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:00.658
You think you're the only one
frustrated?

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.745
Christopher! Stop!
You're hurting me.

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:05.546
[breathing hard]

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:15.742
It's okay.

01:12:18.944 --> 01:12:20.141
You didn't mean it.

01:12:51.928 --> 01:12:52.950
We'll go to florida.

01:12:54.852 --> 01:12:55.563
Sarasota...

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.360
Where all
the circus people live.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.939
Yeah.

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.412
We can star
in a freak show.

01:13:01.414 --> 01:13:04.430
We can pretend
this never happened.

01:13:04.432 --> 01:13:07.545
We can make sure that
it never happens again.

01:13:13.326 --> 01:13:15.798
The thing is...

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.399
I want to feel
this way about you.

01:13:20.499 --> 01:13:22.046
I love you.

01:13:22.768 --> 01:13:25.849
I don't know if I can
ever love anyone else.

01:13:26.049 --> 01:13:27.686
[door opens]

01:13:27.688 --> 01:13:32.833
Cory doesn't feel so good.

01:13:47.784 --> 01:13:49.524
He's been
vomiting for hours.

01:13:49.624 --> 01:13:50.579
I think it might be
food poisoning.

01:13:50.679 --> 01:13:52.469
He needs to go
to the hospital.

01:13:56.191 --> 01:13:57.015
Why are you just
standing there?

01:13:57.215 --> 01:14:00.103
Don't you care
what happens to him?

01:14:00.105 --> 01:14:04.864
Have you forgotten
that you're his mother?

01:14:04.964 --> 01:14:05.974
You.

01:14:05.976 --> 01:14:08.511
It's always you.

01:14:12.611 --> 01:14:13.201
Cathy, stop!

01:14:13.501 --> 01:14:15.149
You think
you can do anything you want

01:14:15.249 --> 01:14:16.987
And people will believe you.

01:14:17.087 --> 01:14:17.882
They'll learn the truth someday.

01:14:17.982 --> 01:14:20.779
When your husband learns

01:14:20.879 --> 01:14:23.454
You have four children
locked away in an attic,

01:14:23.554 --> 01:14:25.859
See how "perfect"
he thinks you really are.

01:14:25.959 --> 01:14:26.766
And your father, too.

01:14:28.366 --> 01:14:29.599
You won't inherit
one damned penny,

01:14:29.699 --> 01:14:32.236
And I'll be glad!

01:14:33.336 --> 01:14:34.386
The girl is right,
corrine.

01:14:34.486 --> 01:14:37.417
That child should go
to the hospital.

01:14:59.717 --> 01:15:00.872
[floor creaking]

01:15:00.874 --> 01:15:02.734
[lock turning]

01:15:14.758 --> 01:15:15.462
I drove cory to the hospital.

01:15:17.362 --> 01:15:17.866
How is he?

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:22.042
Cory had pneumonia.

01:15:22.142 --> 01:15:23.510
The doctors did
all they could, but...

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:28.968
It was too late.

01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:36.423
Will there be
a funeral?

01:15:38.523 --> 01:15:39.671
He's already been buried.

01:16:05.554 --> 01:16:06.612
I'm sorry.

01:16:06.712 --> 01:16:07.405
[bawling continues]

01:16:17.611 --> 01:16:19.248
[cathy]: Carrie?

01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:20.989
Cathy.

01:16:22.089 --> 01:16:23.979
Just let her be.

01:16:30.765 --> 01:16:31.429
We need to run away.

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.132
Or else we're all
gonna die like cory.

01:16:34.134 --> 01:16:35.384
Do we have
enough money?

01:16:35.386 --> 01:16:36.508
We'll go tonight.

01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.531
Take everything we can.
Money, jewelry.

01:16:38.533 --> 01:16:41.880
Everything.

01:17:14.376 --> 01:17:18.257
She's not coming back
Is she?

01:17:20.157 --> 01:17:21.760
She's dead to us now.

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:27.967
When do we tell her?

01:17:27.969 --> 01:17:29.540
After breakfast.

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:30.889
I don't want her
getting scared.

01:17:30.891 --> 01:17:32.783
More than she has to be.

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:35.655
So we just walk right
out the front door?

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.177
We wait till dinner,

01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:39.333
When all the servants and family

01:17:39.335 --> 01:17:40.874
Are in the kitchen
or dining room.

01:17:40.876 --> 01:17:41.902
So carrie and I will
go to the fence

01:17:41.904 --> 01:17:43.058
And you'll go to the shed

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:43.989
So you can turn off
the electricity?

01:17:43.991 --> 01:17:45.338
Then we catch up
by the lake

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.264
And head to the depot
for the evening train.

01:17:47.266 --> 01:17:49.512
And by the time
grandmother comes in

01:17:49.514 --> 01:17:50.636
With our breakfast
tomorrow,

01:17:50.638 --> 01:17:52.499
We'll be halfway
to florida.

01:17:52.699 --> 01:17:56.496
I was thinking,
I can sell my ring.

01:17:59.026 --> 01:17:59.896
It's okay.

01:17:59.996 --> 01:18:00.822
It's what
dad would've wanted.

01:18:00.824 --> 01:18:03.510
You're keeping that ring.

01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:04.429
Forever.

01:18:34.598 --> 01:18:37.423
I'm telling you,
I did hear someone.

01:18:37.425 --> 01:18:39.060
Must be those mice.
They make an awful racket.

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.698
You can hear them
all the way up in the attic.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.978
Mrs. Foxworth carries
enough poison up there

01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:44.455
To kill
a german army of 'em.

01:18:44.457 --> 01:18:47.184
Do you think miss corrine
will sell the place?

01:18:47.186 --> 01:18:50.106
I doubt she'll be
making any hasty decisions.

01:18:50.108 --> 01:18:51.583
Hasty? It's been
seven months

01:18:51.585 --> 01:18:53.221
Since mr. Foxworth died.

01:18:53.223 --> 01:18:54.795
Well, never mind that.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:57.716
All you maids will be
losing your job soon enough

01:18:57.718 --> 01:18:59.868
If you don't
mind the silver.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.700
[footfalls receding]

01:19:07.622 --> 01:19:08.709
Carrie, you gotta
eat something.

01:19:08.809 --> 01:19:10.310
You have to be strong,
for later.

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:13.041
No. Don't feel well.

01:19:13.141 --> 01:19:15.720
I have to
take care of mickey.

01:19:18.163 --> 01:19:18.842
Where'd you get that?

01:19:18.942 --> 01:19:20.633
I saved it for cory,

01:19:20.733 --> 01:19:23.495
For when he came back
from the hospital.

01:19:59.473 --> 01:20:02.330
Cathy, we need to
leave right now.

01:20:03.326 --> 01:20:05.381
[sniffling]

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.435
It's mickey.

01:20:07.437 --> 01:20:10.325
Carrie gave him
one of cory's donuts

01:20:10.327 --> 01:20:12.317
And he just started
whimpering all of a sudden--

01:20:12.318 --> 01:20:15.175
No. No.
That can't be right.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.716
What?

01:20:16.717 --> 01:20:18.675
The powdered sugar
on the donuts,

01:20:18.677 --> 01:20:20.216
I think
there was poison in it.

01:20:20.218 --> 01:20:21.597
That's why we're sick.

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:23.625
Are you saying that
our grandmother

01:20:23.627 --> 01:20:26.153
Tried to kill us?

01:20:28.873 --> 01:20:31.192
You have a key.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:32.829
[door bangs shut]

01:20:32.831 --> 01:20:35.045
Now give it to me.

01:20:35.245 --> 01:20:37.042
No.

01:20:37.044 --> 01:20:39.033
Give it to me
this instant!

01:20:40.062 --> 01:20:42.180
[wracked with coughing]

01:20:42.182 --> 01:20:43.336
Seed of the devil!

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:48.859
Give me that!

01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:52.754
You're never gonna
leave this room!

01:20:52.854 --> 01:20:55.775
[scoffing]
you're gonna hit me?

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:57.529
You're gonna whip me?

01:20:57.531 --> 01:20:59.070
Come on!

01:20:59.072 --> 01:21:01.061
Come on. Do it.

01:21:02.089 --> 01:21:03.951
[snickering]

01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:07.483
Beautiful, prideful.

01:21:07.485 --> 01:21:08.704
And weak!

01:21:08.706 --> 01:21:09.795
Just like your mother.

01:21:09.797 --> 01:21:11.594
That's not true.

01:21:12.596 --> 01:21:14.242
You were never
meant to be born.

01:21:14.342 --> 01:21:16.122
You're a stain
on the foxworth name!

01:21:16.124 --> 01:21:18.594
On the name of
the lord himself.

01:21:18.596 --> 01:21:21.259
Now, if you
give me that key,

01:21:21.261 --> 01:21:24.496
I may show you
a little mercy.

01:21:29.169 --> 01:21:30.098
Christopher...

01:21:30.198 --> 01:21:31.455
Come on!

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:33.878
Christopher...

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.355
[gasps] let go!

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.768
Cathy, go to the attic!

01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:38.310
No! Give me that!

01:21:38.312 --> 01:21:43.062
Come back here!
Come back here!

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.989
Carrie, please!

01:21:44.991 --> 01:21:47.622
[carrie gasping]

01:21:47.624 --> 01:21:49.356
Cathy!

01:21:49.358 --> 01:21:51.058
[bangs door shut]

01:21:52.119 --> 01:21:53.691
Why did you do that?

01:21:53.693 --> 01:21:56.421
Don't close the door.

01:21:56.423 --> 01:21:59.503
I need for the door
to be open!

01:22:01.912 --> 01:22:03.710
No. Not the door.

01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:04.962
Don't turn off
the light.

01:22:04.964 --> 01:22:06.857
Open the door!
Turn on the light!

01:22:06.859 --> 01:22:09.843
I need the door
to be open!

01:22:09.845 --> 01:22:12.027
What are you doing?

01:22:12.028 --> 01:22:14.788
No! No! Open the door!

01:22:15.816 --> 01:22:17.518
[weeping] no!

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.701
What are you doing?

01:22:20.954 --> 01:22:22.591
Like you said,

01:22:22.593 --> 01:22:24.871
God sees everything.

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:27.022
He'll punish you
for what you did to us.

01:22:27.024 --> 01:22:29.880
To cory.

01:22:29.882 --> 01:22:32.225
It wasn't me!

01:22:32.227 --> 01:22:36.045
It was your mother
who poisoned you, not me!

01:22:38.422 --> 01:22:40.477
It doesn't
matter anymore.

01:22:40.479 --> 01:22:42.179
[grandmother sobbing]

01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:43.785
Where are you going?

01:22:43.787 --> 01:22:46.128
Don't go!

01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:47.381
Don't leave me!

01:22:47.383 --> 01:22:50.495
Help! Help!

01:22:50.497 --> 01:22:52.198
Help!

01:22:54.093 --> 01:22:56.018
[christopher coughing]

01:23:05.332 --> 01:23:07.835
Cathy, we have to go.

01:23:07.837 --> 01:23:09.344
Be right there.

01:23:11.369 --> 01:23:12.716
[chalk clatters]

01:23:29.736 --> 01:23:30.667
[rope creaking]

01:23:34.842 --> 01:23:36.062
[gasping]

01:23:36.063 --> 01:23:38.244
[thud]

01:23:38.246 --> 01:23:39.593
Are you okay?

01:23:40.879 --> 01:23:41.938
Come on.

01:23:49.292 --> 01:23:51.795
I'll cut the electricity
and meet you at the lake.

01:23:51.797 --> 01:23:52.855
No! No!

01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:54.814
We're not
going without you.

01:23:54.816 --> 01:23:57.544
Hurry!
We have to make this train.

01:23:57.545 --> 01:23:58.668
Stop!

01:23:58.670 --> 01:24:01.854
Stop, if you know
what's good for you!

01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:06.635
Please...

01:24:08.012 --> 01:24:11.938
We're corrine's children.

01:24:13.343 --> 01:24:15.491
My god.

01:24:17.549 --> 01:24:19.104
Go.

01:24:19.204 --> 01:24:19.924
Before I'm sent
after you!

01:24:19.926 --> 01:24:21.370
I'll cut the power
on the fence.

01:24:21.372 --> 01:24:22.461
Go!

01:24:28.210 --> 01:24:30.232
[chugging]

01:24:47.862 --> 01:24:50.591
We never have to see
that place again, cath.

01:24:52.422 --> 01:24:54.188
It's all over.

01:24:55.344 --> 01:24:58.233
[cathy]: <i>And for the first time</i>
<i>in a long time,</i>

01:24:58.235 --> 01:24:59.871
<i>We felt alive,</i>

01:24:59.873 --> 01:25:00.994
<i>Free.</i>

01:25:00.996 --> 01:25:02.858
<i>We had everything ahead of us.</i>

01:25:04.945 --> 01:25:08.734
<i>But someday,</i>
<i>we'd see mom again.</i>

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:11.720
<i>And we'd look her</i>
<i>straight in the eye,</i>

01:25:11.722 --> 01:25:14.738
<i>The children she once loved,</i>

01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:17.243
<i>And all our shame</i>
<i>and hopelessness</i>

01:25:17.245 --> 01:25:18.591
<i>Would become hers.</i>
