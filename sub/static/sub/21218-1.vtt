00:22.650 --> 00:24.320
Okay.

00:24.320 --> 00:28.590
I just want to be clear
about something ...

00:28.600 --> 00:34.170
This is a deli,
a delicatessen.

00:34.170 --> 00:34.170
You know that right?

00:34.170 --> 00:37.640
You're robbing a deli,
not like, a bank.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.170
You know it's like meat,
cheeses, potato salad,

00:40.170 --> 00:44.580
macaroni salad ... okay.

00:50.380 --> 00:51.380
Should I bag it?

00:51.380 --> 00:53.320
- Yeah.

00:54.590 --> 00:56.820
Okay.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.630
Have a great day, rocket.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.770
- What did you call me?

01:12.770 --> 01:15.670
Nothing.
Nothing.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.140
Enjoy your money.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.840
- No, no, no.

01:18.850 --> 01:21.150
What did you call me?

01:21.150 --> 01:24.380
Class 2006, "let's
go lions, let's go!"

01:25.580 --> 01:28.220
You're Luke cromwell.

01:28.220 --> 01:31.120
The rocket.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.590
- First of all, it's
pronounced crom-well.

01:33.590 --> 01:35.160
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.230
- Second, I have no idea
who you're talking about.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.260
You dated Alice Evans
through most of grade 12.

01:40.270 --> 01:40.260
- Hey. I'm warning you, man.

01:40.270 --> 01:43.370
You also have the single season
football rushing record and you

01:43.370 --> 01:44.870
- stop it!

01:44.870 --> 01:47.810
... have your nickname
tattooed on your knuckles.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.410
- Shit.

02:01.550 --> 02:03.350
Who the hell are you?

02:03.360 --> 02:07.530
Oh. Yeah. I'm Corey.

02:07.530 --> 02:09.430
Corey?

02:09.430 --> 02:12.600
Swanson.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.530
Corey Swanson.

02:16.900 --> 02:21.470
No. No?

02:25.510 --> 02:27.250
Wow!

02:27.250 --> 02:28.350
Okay.

02:28.350 --> 02:29.880
No, no.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.680
Dita wait. Wait, wait,
wait. Just wait.

02:31.680 --> 02:31.680
- Call the cops!

02:31.680 --> 02:38.660
This guy- he ...? He chased
the robber out there

02:38.660 --> 02:43.390
and he got the money back
for us, actually.

02:46.170 --> 02:47.930
You're sitting on the wrong guy.

02:54.810 --> 02:57.880
This guy is a hero.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.350
He is. Yeah, he's a hero.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.520
Oh. Yeah, when dita retires
she's going to sell to me.

03:15.290 --> 03:18.260
There's an old hardware store
sitting empty next door, so...

03:18.260 --> 03:19.430
Expansion.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.470
- Expansion.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.780
Yeah.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.450
Some big brain
buddies you got there.

03:35.450 --> 03:37.280
You.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.720
You remembering all that
stuff you said about me.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.620
You perform that
mental trick tonight,

03:42.620 --> 03:43.990
you're going to be the
hit of the party.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.960
I mean, you are
going tonight, right?

03:48.960 --> 03:52.400
The reunion?

03:53.770 --> 03:56.270
Oh, is that ... that's tonight?

03:56.270 --> 03:58.700
- Yeah, man.
It's ten years.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.470
Ten years, can you
believe it?

04:02.940 --> 04:04.840
- I won't be going
now, I guess.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.810
- How come?

04:06.810 --> 04:09.750
- I just needed some extra
cash to fix myself up a bit.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.320
The rocket can't just
show up looking like

04:11.320 --> 04:14.020
some kind of a homeless loser.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.019
You were the most popular
guy in high school.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.620
- Sure.

04:18.630 --> 04:20.019
- No, really. Look, when i
was in grade 10

04:20.029 --> 04:21.660
you were in grade 12,

04:21.660 --> 04:22.890
everybody looked up to you.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.560
You were a god.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.900
When I was a senior and
you were still there

04:26.900 --> 04:29.600
you were.. Same deal.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.810
You know what?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.810
You and the rocket.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.680
Walker heights reunion.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.490
- Oh, I ...

04:47.490 --> 04:49.620
- Come on man, get excited
for once in your life, huh?

04:49.620 --> 04:52.020
- No. I can't.

04:52.030 --> 04:56.760
There's too many bad memories.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.660
You know I read that ... you
know, what's her name

04:59.670 --> 05:00.930
is going to be there.

05:00.930 --> 05:03.570
Miss thing.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.310
Sheena ... what's it ... you
know that wrestling girl?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.440
Sheena dewilde?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.680
- Yeah, that's the one.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.480
Yeah, I want to get
a good look at her.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.980
See if she's as bangable
as she is on TV.

05:38.370 --> 05:40.870
I'm just going to stop you right
there, because I wasn't dumped.

05:40.870 --> 05:43.610
It was kind of a mutual decision
that I needed to take some time

05:43.610 --> 05:46.880
off and that's why I've been
training and focusing on

05:46.880 --> 05:48.710
becoming a better wrestler.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.420
It wasn't like I was fired
or anything like that.

06:00.790 --> 06:05.060
Everyone's careers go up
and down and I've...

06:05.060 --> 06:07.700
Dude, seriously? Off.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.770
Oh my god.

06:20.650 --> 06:21.810
This is Zach.
- Hey.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.410
Really, really cool guy.

06:33.690 --> 06:35.960
Smile for the camera.

06:46.810 --> 06:48.640
Stop doing that.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.780
Dude, just ...

07:22.010 --> 07:26.540
I have universal
abundance within me.

07:26.550 --> 07:28.210
I am one with the world.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.480
- Hi.

07:33.490 --> 07:35.120
You're not easy to
find Dr. Hayden.

07:37.990 --> 07:38.920
- Corey.
- Corey!

07:38.930 --> 07:41.060
- Yeah.
- Corey.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.060
I was coming for some advice,

07:47.070 --> 07:49.000
but I think I can figure
it out actually.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.970
- No. Follow me.

07:58.710 --> 08:03.010
As you can see my therapy
career is temporarily on hold.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.580
Economic downturn,
what have you.

08:05.590 --> 08:06.850
- Yeah, I know it's
rough out there.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.650
Yeah.

08:08.650 --> 08:12.190
An opportunity has sort of
presented itself suddenly and

08:12.190 --> 08:14.630
it's ... if this is a bad time
i can just take off ...?

08:14.630 --> 08:15.960
- No, no, no. No, no.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.230
I've just got to
do something quick.

08:17.230 --> 08:17.230
Bing bang.

08:17.230 --> 08:22.770
- Okay, yeah. So look, it's
sort of the big c-word.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.070
Closure.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.140
I should have just said that.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.080
Ah.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.280
Look, sheena is
... sheena's back.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.080
She's back in town.

08:38.020 --> 08:40.720
- What does getting
closure mean to you now?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.690
I don't know, I mean i
just figured...

08:42.690 --> 08:49.260
Sorry, continue.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.040
I don't know.

08:59.040 --> 09:02.770
Really I got the chance
now to like, see her.

09:02.780 --> 09:04.680
Look at her.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.880
Not when she's on TV, in person.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.850
I should go see her, right?

09:13.050 --> 09:14.890
Corey.

09:14.890 --> 09:19.020
The last time you two saw
each other, as I recall,

09:19.030 --> 09:20.660
things did not go very well.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.590
Yes, yeah. No, I know. It
went really bad. Yeah.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.000
It's been a long time, okay?
Ten years.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.100
Then I would proceed,
with caution.

09:31.940 --> 09:34.710
I will.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.870
I'm going to go do it.
I'm going to go see her.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.280
I'm going to go see her.
Thank you. Thank you.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.290
Hey, mom?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.790
Hey, I'm going to
the reunion tonight.

09:52.790 --> 09:56.090
I'll probably be
home by like, 11.

09:56.100 --> 09:58.660
Not that I have to tell
you any of that because

09:58.660 --> 10:00.360
I'm a 28 year old
fully grown man

10:00.370 --> 10:03.170
and I don't have to tell you
anything about my life.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.050
Hey.

10:15.050 --> 10:16.880
Oh, you scared me.

10:18.080 --> 10:23.190
I figured I'd take
you up on your offer.

10:26.390 --> 10:28.130
Corey Swanson?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.700
You tried to rob me earlier?

10:34.000 --> 10:36.930
- Oh. Yeah, you.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Carey.

10:39.140 --> 10:46.780
- So what do you want?
- To go to the reunion.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.950
You said you didn't have
anything to wear...

10:47.950 --> 10:51.180
So this is my dad's.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.820
- Boom.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.930
Hey, man.

11:08.270 --> 11:09.270
All right.
Let's do this.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.100
Oh, is that Alice Evans?

11:14.110 --> 11:16.110
That's Alice Evans.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.310
- Right there.
- Yeah it is.

11:19.310 --> 11:20.880
- How do I look?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.710
- Awesome.

11:34.130 --> 11:36.190
Hey babe, the
rockets landed.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.200
Don't touch me.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.800
- Why?
- Oh, Luke!

11:41.800 --> 11:43.270
- Yeah, what's new?

11:43.270 --> 11:44.900
- I'm born again.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.800
- You're ... okay.

11:46.810 --> 11:49.110
- Christian.

11:49.110 --> 11:50.470
- Fucking a.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.280
She still wants me man.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.880
Let's get a beer.

11:59.890 --> 12:02.890
We're sticking around.
- Yeah.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.400
9 o'clock, check it out.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.870
Yep, I'd still do that.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.080
You know back in the day she
used to hit on me all the time.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.950
Yo Carey, where you going?

12:37.320 --> 12:39.420
Your plane is going to crash and
then you're going to have to eat

12:39.430 --> 12:42.030
other passengers
so you can survive.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.060
You're going to die a friendless
virgin who's had no

12:47.070 --> 12:50.870
sexual interactions so
the blue balls kill you.

12:52.340 --> 12:54.970
You wrestling contract is fake
and you actually signed up to be

12:54.970 --> 12:57.940
a lifetime spokesman
for north Korea.

13:00.810 --> 13:04.110
- You're going to live with your
mom forever in her basement, and

13:04.120 --> 13:06.250
sleep in the same bed for
the rest of your life.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.820
Oh I hope not.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.860
You still nervous?

13:11.860 --> 13:13.420
Yeah.

13:16.800 --> 13:21.870
What if this is a big mistake?

13:21.870 --> 13:26.240
What if in 15 years I'm nothing?

13:26.240 --> 13:31.310
- That's not possible.
- Why?

13:31.310 --> 13:35.280
Because you're sheena, and
you're really talented

13:35.280 --> 13:39.120
and super smart and awesome
and ... come on.

13:40.350 --> 13:42.490
You're awesome, you know?

13:42.490 --> 13:45.590
You'll always have me.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.360
- I don't know what I'd
ever do without you.

13:47.360 --> 13:53.100
Announcer: I've been
blabbering on for long enough.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.000
What do you say we bring her
on out here and give her

13:56.000 --> 13:56.900
a proper send off?

13:58.840 --> 14:00.500
- You look great and you look
like you're in super shape

14:00.510 --> 14:02.240
- I found this online!

14:02.240 --> 14:02.240
- Congratulations on that.

14:02.240 --> 14:02.240
Thanks yeah I've
been training hard.

14:02.240 --> 14:07.910
- No, stop screwing around!
- I hate your coffee!

14:07.910 --> 14:08.880
- Sounds like
you're stalking me.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.220
- No. Dude, dude.

14:11.220 --> 14:14.020
- Where the is my money,
where the is it?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.320
- I don't have it!

14:18.290 --> 14:20.960
Would have been nice if someone
told me this was happening.

14:21.890 --> 14:23.190
I didn't do anything.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.230
No I'm not a drug
addict, get out.

14:29.270 --> 14:31.270
Idiot!

14:31.270 --> 14:32.940
- What do you have to say
for yourself sheena?

14:32.940 --> 14:35.140
Get that out of my
face.

14:35.140 --> 14:36.370
- Love you sheena!

14:36.380 --> 14:38.410
Sheena: You.

14:41.280 --> 14:48.150
Announcer: Walker heights'
biggest export, sheena dewilde.

14:54.330 --> 14:58.630
Thank you, ten years.

14:58.630 --> 15:01.130
Yeah, it's been a long time.

15:01.130 --> 15:02.600
- That sleazy reality show
that you were on,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.000
you gonna do another season?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.100
- Yeah, good luck.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.300
- Broke her producer's windpipe.

15:07.310 --> 15:10.570
Wait that's not at all what
happened, okay what happened-

15:10.580 --> 15:10.570
announcer: Enough.

15:10.580 --> 15:15.380
Why did you really quit the
bwl after the

15:15.380 --> 15:16.910
rocky mountains smash thirteen.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.480
Woman: She never quit,
she was fired for attacking

15:18.480 --> 15:20.320
some guy in a golf cart.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.450
Sheena; Okay, yeah
it's no secret,

15:22.450 --> 15:24.290
I've made some
mistakes, okay?

15:24.290 --> 15:27.060
But the bwl, they banned
me for a year,

15:27.060 --> 15:28.930
but that year is
almost over.

15:28.930 --> 15:31.330
- Ask her a question.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.000
See if she's a born again.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.370
- Let's put on the proper video.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.470
- Smasheena's new career,

15:51.520 --> 15:53.220
robotic voice: "Do
you want fries with that?"

15:56.190 --> 15:58.290
- Aaagh!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.460
Whoa!

16:09.230 --> 16:10.500
Get in there.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.500
Cop a feel, grab her underwear.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.740
Sheena!

16:18.740 --> 16:20.380
Sheena!

16:23.350 --> 16:24.510
Sheena, come on let's
get out of here.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.480
Come on, sheena.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.450
- Careful.

16:30.460 --> 16:32.160
You don't want to
set him off again.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.520
- Hey isn't that that guy?

16:36.260 --> 16:38.730
That's the guy that
jumped isn't it?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.700
- Alright he's very fragile,
let's give him some space.

16:41.770 --> 16:43.600
Sheena: Thank you for
this really nice,

16:43.600 --> 16:46.400
yet incredibly
awkward send off.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.210
To a special someone you
make every day worth it,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.280
you know who you are.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.250
What else?

17:03.260 --> 17:07.060
Definitely not going to miss
physics, or home ec,

17:07.060 --> 17:10.460
or the questionable beef
dip in the cafeteria

17:10.460 --> 17:13.760
which I have no
idea why it's ...

17:13.770 --> 17:16.030
- Sorry, sorry,
I'm so sorry.

17:16.040 --> 17:16.030
Sorry.

17:16.040 --> 17:20.569
I don't want to interrupt but i
do, I just want to say something

17:20.569 --> 17:21.540
really fast.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.310
I'm sorry.

17:23.310 --> 17:24.740
Okay, all right.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.210
Sheena, you look beautiful.

17:27.210 --> 17:31.680
I know everybody here is going
to miss you, obviously, but I

17:31.680 --> 17:36.620
think I can say that I'm
going to miss you the most.

17:36.620 --> 17:40.260
I was thinking, i
wouldn't miss you if ...

17:45.260 --> 17:48.170
Sheena dewilde,

17:59.140 --> 18:01.140
will you marry me?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.320
Crowd: Say yes!

18:05.320 --> 18:07.750
Come on, say yes!

18:07.750 --> 18:10.320
Do it!

18:23.700 --> 18:25.470
Mom: I just don't know how
this could have happened.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.110
- Mom, shh.

18:28.110 --> 18:30.370
He never gets hurt, he
never does anything.

18:33.410 --> 18:34.340
Corey: I do stuff.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.180
Corey.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.850
Doctor: Any medical problems
that you're aware of?

18:37.850 --> 18:40.680
Of course not, he
never gets sick.

18:40.690 --> 18:43.390
I give him vitamins
every morning.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.860
He doesn't know.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.460
- I know.

18:49.390 --> 18:49.390
What are you writing?

18:49.390 --> 18:52.330
Write down that he
is perfectly normal.

18:52.330 --> 18:54.200
- We may need to
run more tests.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.230
Corey you stay there
and don't move.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.640
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:10.280 --> 19:16.650
- So you're him? Huh?

19:19.860 --> 19:23.290
I realised it when smasheena
was caving in your face

19:23.300 --> 19:28.800
that you were ... you.

19:28.800 --> 19:33.640
Yep. Yeah, that's me.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.240
Look man I get it if it's a
little weird to hangout

19:36.240 --> 19:38.510
with me now. I understand.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.650
No. No, no, no.

19:41.650 --> 19:50.450
I just wanted to say to you that
... I just wanted to see,

19:50.460 --> 19:55.290
I meant see if you were okay.

19:55.290 --> 20:00.860
Actually sounds crazy, but
last night was awesome.

20:00.870 --> 20:08.770
- That's good, so ... you
know, hang loose man.

20:08.770 --> 20:12.910
Hang loose.
- Yeah.

20:12.910 --> 20:16.810
Flowers, those are for you.

20:16.820 --> 20:20.820
There were chocolates
but I ate them.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.830
Ow.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.810
Hm.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.870
Mom, what are you doing?

20:43.880 --> 20:46.740
What, what- those
are my flowers, mom.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.810
- Not anymore.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.020
You always thought that you
could hide things from me?

20:53.020 --> 20:54.920
- What? What things?

20:54.920 --> 21:00.760
Bad report cards, broken
toys, lingerie catalogues.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.460
I've explained this, like,
a million times, all right?

21:02.460 --> 21:05.730
Those, they came
with the mattress.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.600
They weren't mine.

21:09.030 --> 21:09.970
Ow.

21:09.970 --> 21:13.700
- Are you okay? Inside?

21:13.710 --> 21:15.970
You remember what
Dr. Hayden told you?

21:15.970 --> 21:17.870
Inside, I'm fine, okay?

21:17.880 --> 21:20.010
Outside, you're hurting my neck.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.550
I'm just so angry.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.350
That angry libesian cow coming
back to hurt you again.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.720
What? What are you
talking about?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.390
What is a libesian?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.820
If you don't know,
I'm not telling you.

21:34.830 --> 21:37.590
Oh, mom.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.830
This was an accident, okay?

21:40.830 --> 21:44.570
And I put myself in the
middle of a big fight, so.

21:44.570 --> 21:48.410
It's always an accident when
someone breaks your heart.

21:48.410 --> 21:49.710
Oh my god.

21:49.710 --> 21:52.380
Mom, we barely
even talked, okay?

21:52.380 --> 21:54.340
There was no heartbreaking.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.910
Well, you just make sure that

21:55.910 --> 21:58.580
you don't give her
another chance.

21:58.580 --> 22:01.320
Promise me?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
Yeah, mom.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.820
- Ow.
- I have to go now.

22:07.830 --> 22:08.990
- Okay.
- I have chores to do.

22:08.990 --> 22:10.860
See you later.

22:10.860 --> 22:11.960
Good day, mom.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.460
- You too, honey.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.020
Is this gonna be, like,
a tradition for you?

22:36.020 --> 22:37.520
Every 10 years, you gotta
hurt the little perv?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.790
What did he do, grab your ass?

22:38.790 --> 22:40.520
No, and I didn't mean to...

22:40.530 --> 22:43.060
- And hey, no big deal, I just
planned this whole charity meet

22:43.060 --> 22:45.560
and greet for my famous pro
wrestler sister.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.770
The least you could do is,
i don't know, support me.

22:48.770 --> 22:50.800
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.500
I'm sorry.

22:53.510 --> 22:55.610
- I forgive you.
Okay, follow me.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.610
Do you see that man
right there?

23:00.610 --> 23:02.550
- Yeah.

23:02.550 --> 23:04.680
- Okay. So that's the
president of my board.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.620
He's basically my boss, and
he's a huge fan of yours.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.720
So you want me to ...

23:10.720 --> 23:12.520
Go over there. Chat him up.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.590
Casually bring up the need for
funding for this shit hole,

23:15.590 --> 23:18.130
and you know, like,
show some cleave.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.930
Like, stroke his ...
- Evelyn!

23:20.930 --> 23:24.830
Ego. His ego, his ego,
sheena. Just go over there

23:24.840 --> 23:26.740
and be nice. Please?

23:26.740 --> 23:28.100
- Open your mind to
this kind of work.

23:28.110 --> 23:29.940
- Please, please, please?

23:29.940 --> 23:31.910
- Fine.
- Thank you.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.090
Okay.

23:43.690 --> 23:44.790
Thank you. Cheers.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.090
Would you like
something to drink?

23:46.090 --> 23:48.860
My grandfather would take
me to the legion hall

23:48.860 --> 23:51.760
on Friday nights when the

23:51.760 --> 23:54.760
legends would come
through the territory.

23:54.770 --> 23:57.730
Course, then it was all
territories, not like now.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.800
No.

23:59.810 --> 24:02.170
No, no, no.

24:02.170 --> 24:05.840
So Evelyn, she's very...
- Frank gotch.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.750
- Frank, yeah.
- Lou tees.

24:08.750 --> 24:09.950
Mm-hmm.

24:09.950 --> 24:16.920
And my all-time favourite,
killer Kowalski.

24:16.920 --> 24:21.690
Yeah. He, he, he was,
he was good...

24:21.690 --> 24:24.990
- For my money
- mm-hmm?

24:25.000 --> 24:30.870
- And repeat this to no one.
- No, I, I won't tell anyone.

24:30.870 --> 24:34.040
- Gorgeous George.
- Mm-hmm?

24:34.040 --> 24:38.580
Was really quite stunning.

24:38.580 --> 24:42.050
- Miss dewilde?

24:42.050 --> 24:45.050
There is an urgent
phone call for you.

24:47.050 --> 24:51.720
Oh, I, I hope everything's okay.
Excuse me, Mr. cross.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.560
Bruno summerkino.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.230
- He, he was, he was good.

24:55.230 --> 24:57.930
- Join me this way virgins.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.660
You know, I'm not
actually a caterer.

24:59.660 --> 25:02.230
You know, I mean, I do work with
food, oddly enough, but, see,

25:02.230 --> 25:06.170
they wouldn't let ... they
wouldn't let me in, and so I

25:06.170 --> 25:09.770
sorta ... and you looked really
uncomfortable back there,

25:09.770 --> 25:09.770
so I hope you don't mind.

25:09.770 --> 25:13.210
Yeah, I, I should actually
get back to my sister.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.780
- Woah, woah, woah.

25:15.780 --> 25:21.020
I mean, we really didn't
get to talk yesterday, and...

25:21.020 --> 25:23.550
Actually, can i
show you something?

25:23.560 --> 25:28.190
It'll take, like, five
minutes. Is that cool?

25:28.190 --> 25:30.960
Yeah. Yeah.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.130
We'll be right back.
Five minutes, okay?

26:13.640 --> 26:16.840
Sheena: Patrick's still
booking matches?

26:16.840 --> 26:19.280
That's crazy.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.910
He gave me my first break here.

26:24.580 --> 26:27.980
Look, I'm, I'm sorry.

26:27.990 --> 26:29.720
I embarrassed you, and
i embarrassed myself.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.190
Yeah, I definitely could've
handled things better.

26:38.200 --> 26:41.630
I really wish that I'd
stayed in touch with you.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.110
I just miss this place.

26:55.110 --> 26:59.650
This room, the
sounds, the smells.

26:59.650 --> 27:02.350
- I thought your dream
was being in the bwl.

27:02.350 --> 27:04.250
- Yeah, it was.

27:04.260 --> 27:07.120
It was awesome for a while.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.890
You know, I got to
travel around the world

27:09.890 --> 27:13.160
and get a little famous.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.700
Crowd: Oh! Horatio,
you smell terrible.

27:19.870 --> 27:25.780
Just years of 300-plus days
on the road, no real friends,

27:25.780 --> 27:28.710
working my tail off while I have
another hand in my pockets.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.080
It just wasn't what i
thought it would be.

27:40.660 --> 27:46.130
They're bringing me back,
bwl, after my suspension.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.870
- That's great. Isn't,
isn't that great?

27:49.870 --> 27:54.840
- Yeah, no.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.440
My manager worked really
hard behind the scenes

27:56.440 --> 27:58.680
to get me in their
good graces, so.

27:58.680 --> 28:01.780
If you're not happy, you
know, you should quit.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.680
- Technically, yeah, I haven't
re-signed my contract, but I,

28:04.680 --> 28:08.350
you know, I couldn't just...
- It's your life, right?

28:12.690 --> 28:19.200
You just ...
Let's get out of here.

28:29.770 --> 28:29.770
- There she is.

28:29.770 --> 28:31.840
Sheena: Yay, you found me.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.180
- Yeah, I texted your treasure.
Not working?

28:33.180 --> 28:35.240
- Missed you.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.450
Oh, hey, brother.
- Hey.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.990
- I'm tab.
- Oh, a tad what?

28:42.990 --> 28:45.820
- No, tab, with a b.
- Oh, yeah, it's tab with a b.

28:45.820 --> 28:49.730
- Yes. You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, totally.

28:49.730 --> 28:50.760
Sheena: What took you so long?

28:50.760 --> 28:50.760
- I got held in Dallas.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.500
It was this whole deal, and
now I need multiple cocktails.

28:54.500 --> 28:54.500
Shall we?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.130
Sheena; Yeah, sounds good.
Just give me a sec.

28:57.140 --> 28:59.470
- Oh, sure, yeah.

28:59.470 --> 29:03.370
- Hey. That's your boyfriend.

29:03.370 --> 29:08.810
- Manager, but boyfriend, yeah.
- Okay.

29:08.810 --> 29:13.020
- Hey, maybe keep that under
your hat, what I said.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.220
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay, cool.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.890
I'm, I'm so glad
that we did this.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.860
- Yeah, me too.
- All right, well, I'll see you.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.930
Yeah. See you.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.200
You okay?

29:33.200 --> 29:35.340
Yeah.

29:35.340 --> 29:41.940
No, I ... look, I, I just, I've
been thinking a lot lately, and

29:41.950 --> 29:47.520
I, I know this is gonna sound
like it's coming out of nowhere.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.450
But what if, like, instead
of going back to the bwl,

29:50.460 --> 29:55.220
slamtasia, the deal that you've
been working on nonstop for me

29:55.230 --> 30:03.330
for 10 months, what if instead i
just kinda gave it up and sort

30:03.330 --> 30:09.440
of retire from pro wrestling
as an alternate plan?

30:10.810 --> 30:12.010
Look, it's, it's what I want.

30:12.010 --> 30:13.810
I'm sorry.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.120
You're not mad?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.820
No, this is what you want.

30:23.820 --> 30:25.820
I'll support you.

30:27.320 --> 30:30.130
But we should just have a
big old retirement match.

30:30.130 --> 30:33.400
I can call Mitch in
Fresno or bj in Jersey.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.500
Corey: Or you could do it here.

30:35.500 --> 30:41.840
- All right, easy, guys, let's
just take it one step at a time.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.240
Yeah, we've gotta get going.
It's really nice to meet you.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.980
- Yeah.
- I'll see you, Corey.

30:45.980 --> 30:49.050
- Yep.
- Good night.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.050
Take care, bud.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.860
- Hi, may I help you?
Let's go sit over here.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.030
Yeah. Okay, so, you saw her?

31:07.030 --> 31:08.260
Mm-hmm.

31:08.270 --> 31:09.970
- Closure?
- Yeah.

31:09.970 --> 31:12.340
- Good, good.
- Did it real casual.

31:12.340 --> 31:14.140
I was like, "hey, let's get out
of here" because she

31:14.140 --> 31:16.110
was gonna fight again, and she
punched me in the face,

31:16.110 --> 31:17.310
and it's totally fine.

31:17.310 --> 31:17.310
It was by mistake.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.980
We talked later, cleared the
air, and we really

31:19.980 --> 31:19.980
connected you know?

31:19.980 --> 31:19.980
She's got this boyfriend, you
know, that's a real jerk,

31:19.980 --> 31:26.050
but she is awesome. She looks
awesome. She sounds awesome.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.150
She smells awesome.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.050
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

31:30.050 --> 31:33.090
- Oh, Corey!
- Mmm okay.

31:33.090 --> 31:35.460
I know, yeah, i
- look, you saw her.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.630
- Yeah.
- You survived.

31:36.630 --> 31:38.490
- Yeah.
- Turn the page.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.060
The last thing you need is to
damage all the positive strides

31:41.070 --> 31:42.430
that you've made.

31:44.130 --> 31:45.470
Hey, Julius, call
for you on line 2.

31:45.470 --> 31:46.500
- Do you hear me?

31:46.500 --> 31:48.600
Hm?

31:48.610 --> 31:50.170
Loud and clear, Dr. Hayden.

31:50.170 --> 31:52.310
Loud and clear.

31:56.350 --> 31:58.080
I get that I'm getting a
little ahead of myself

31:58.080 --> 31:59.280
with the mock ups.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.520
I do, you know.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.050
But I got two days,
really, you know.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.690
Because after this machina day
ceremony, she's gone, you know,

32:05.690 --> 32:07.190
and i- so I gotta get it
together quick,

32:07.190 --> 32:09.230
and it's gotta be big.

32:09.230 --> 32:12.600
And I can't do that alone.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.630
You know, and I figured you know
wrestling, right, and everybody

32:15.630 --> 32:22.040
knows you and so
could, could you help?

32:51.540 --> 32:52.970
She could have her
retirement match

32:52.970 --> 32:54.640
anywhere in the
world, right?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.470
- Yeah.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.140
- Why the hell would
she wanna do it here?

33:00.040 --> 33:05.080
Well, I ... look, I get it, but
it... we talked last night, and,

33:05.080 --> 33:09.190
you know, she got, like, really
sentimental about her career,

33:09.190 --> 33:11.520
and she got, like...
- Wait a minute.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.020
- Sad, actually.

33:13.020 --> 33:15.220
- You were actually
talking to her?

33:15.230 --> 33:17.360
Actually, we hung
out at the pavilion.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.560
It was cool.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.300
Smooth, buds.
You're smooth.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.500
So did you climb her beanstalk?

33:24.500 --> 33:26.400
Climb the old- oh, no, whoa.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.400
No, no, no.

33:27.410 --> 33:28.400
No, nothing like that, no.

33:28.410 --> 33:31.110
We just, we just talked.

33:31.110 --> 33:35.180
Look, I, I just know that
she really needs this,

33:35.180 --> 33:35.180
you know, in my gut.

33:35.180 --> 33:38.410
Sounds like what she really
needs is a good old foggy slam,

33:38.420 --> 33:39.520
if you know what I mean.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.750
Yeah, know what you
mean. I get it.

33:40.750 --> 33:43.020
Go for a figure-four leg lock.

33:43.020 --> 33:45.090
Make her tap out.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.620
Make her show you
her Boston crab.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.060
Okay, that's really funny.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.660
- Deliver her a
vietnamese Jewel press.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.660
You wanna stop now?

33:50.660 --> 33:54.260
Wait. Pile drive her.

33:54.270 --> 33:54.260
- Okay, all right, okay.

33:54.270 --> 33:57.030
I'm just, I'm trying to
reconnect with her man,

33:57.040 --> 33:57.030
you know?

33:57.040 --> 34:00.100
And I don't know where this
opportunity's gonna go exactly.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.670
I just, I don't want
it to blow by me.

34:01.670 --> 34:01.670
That's all.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.210
- And the longer you
keep her in town,

34:04.210 --> 34:04.210
- the more we get to hang out.

34:04.210 --> 34:07.310
- And then her love for the
downward tingles touches your

34:07.310 --> 34:10.810
penis, and she stays forever.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.420
Something like that.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.150
Never gonna work.

34:14.150 --> 34:15.449
Never.

34:15.449 --> 34:18.449
I mean, we're talking
about sheena de wilde.

34:18.460 --> 34:23.389
You are, like, you know, buds.

34:23.389 --> 34:25.230
The odds are ...

34:25.230 --> 34:29.400
- I am aware of the
odds, yeah.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.370
- Hold up.

34:31.370 --> 34:31.370
I didn't say I wouldn't do it.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.800
I'll get to work on
some ideas right now.

34:33.810 --> 34:35.570
- Really?

34:35.570 --> 34:38.610
- Yeah, for 165 bucks.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.239
- 165 bucks?

34:40.239 --> 34:40.239
- That's right.

34:40.239 --> 34:43.080
Rent's a little steep, you
know, and you're the one

34:43.080 --> 34:44.750
who came to me.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.679
- Well, yeah, I know I came to
you, but I work in a deli.

34:47.690 --> 34:48.820
- Yeah, I want it in cash.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.850
Now.

35:00.760 --> 35:00.760
Oh, hey, angel.

35:00.770 --> 35:04.170
I was just wondering if
oh, my. What are you.. Ow.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.770
What- okay, ow, wait, okay.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.840
I just have a quick question.

35:07.840 --> 35:11.440
Sorry. Thought you were
going for my tips.

35:15.550 --> 35:17.150
I'm sorry to interrupt ...

35:27.160 --> 35:29.390
Excuse me miss, i- I, I'm sorry

35:29.390 --> 35:30.460
boy: Hey, no cutting!

35:31.760 --> 35:34.760
Corey: Yeah, I won't.
I'll go to the back.

35:34.770 --> 35:37.270
- Reverse it like ...
Like that kind of thing.

35:37.270 --> 35:40.140
- Anything you can think of,
throw it all in one pile.

35:41.510 --> 35:44.240
I like where you're
goin' with that.

35:45.310 --> 35:45.310
You like these posters?

35:45.310 --> 35:48.210
They're the only
things I have planned.

35:58.590 --> 36:03.390
Wa, whoa- what are you doing?
You scared the crap outta me!

36:03.390 --> 36:04.930
I've been hearing things.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.900
What ... what, what things?

36:07.900 --> 36:10.870
Like you. Renting out
the pavilion.

36:10.870 --> 36:13.340
What's next? Ask
her out?

36:13.340 --> 36:15.770
Date her? Marry
her forever?

36:15.770 --> 36:17.540
How do you know everything?

36:17.540 --> 36:20.510
Male voice: Ah shit!

36:20.510 --> 36:22.210
Mom: It's just
Malcolm, all right?

36:22.210 --> 36:24.810
He's helping me
with hedges.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.590
Just uh, helping
with the hedges.

36:30.590 --> 36:34.220
That's cool, Malcolm.
- Okay ...

36:34.230 --> 36:35.660
Mom; We are not going
through this again.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.560
- Yeah, I know.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.260
Goodnight, Malcolm.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.530
- Night, Corey.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.340
Partners in business, life true.

36:47.340 --> 36:49.640
When I saw her perform, well
... she just takes your breath

36:49.640 --> 36:51.470
away, doesn't she?

36:51.480 --> 36:52.810
These hundreds of fans who
came out here today,

36:52.810 --> 36:54.610
they feel the same
way that I do.

36:54.610 --> 36:55.910
Her story's yet to be told.

36:55.910 --> 36:57.680
- Hey.
- You made it.

36:57.680 --> 37:01.320
Yeah, I did, yeah. Uh, thank
you for the invite.

37:01.320 --> 37:04.990
The whole town was
invited ... but you too.

37:04.990 --> 37:07.420
Yeah ...

37:07.430 --> 37:08.790
- I'm sure you're busy ...

37:08.790 --> 37:10.560
- Hey, uh, actually I was
wondering have you put more

37:10.560 --> 37:12.760
thought into doing the
retirement match here?

37:12.760 --> 37:14.960
Cuz', if you did, I'm sure we
can get the pavilion ...

37:14.970 --> 37:17.400
Which would be ... we'd
redo the whole thing.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.470
We're actually looking into
some bigger opportunities

37:18.470 --> 37:19.840
down south, Corey.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.900
Chicago.

37:20.910 --> 37:22.540
Maybe even Florida.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.970
Yeah, but it'd be
great, you know,

37:23.980 --> 37:25.370
I mean this whole
town would come.

37:25.380 --> 37:27.480
Guarantee it, like
everybody you've ever met

37:27.480 --> 37:29.910
would pack that house.
- Oh, that's our cue.

37:30.810 --> 37:32.920
Oh, okay, um, talk after?

37:32.920 --> 37:35.780
- Yeah yeah.
- Okay. Cool.

37:35.790 --> 37:40.760
- Ladies and gentlemen, let's
have a big hometown welcome

37:40.760 --> 37:42.590
sheena de wilde!

37:53.000 --> 37:54.900
Thank you.

37:54.910 --> 37:58.840
- Fraud ...

37:58.840 --> 38:00.780
Fraudulent robot.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.780
Reality check!

38:05.780 --> 38:08.480
Who here thinks that living
the Los Angeles dream

38:08.490 --> 38:11.050
has made her soft?

38:11.060 --> 38:12.920
Crowd: Ohhh!

38:12.920 --> 38:14.390
Is this part of the deal?

38:14.390 --> 38:15.990
You don't see me flying
around the world ...

38:15.990 --> 38:20.830
Getting my feet massaged ...
Drinking cucumber smoothies.

38:20.830 --> 38:23.370
You sure as hell don't see
me getting my opponents

38:23.370 --> 38:24.730
hand-picked.

38:28.570 --> 38:31.010
Just ... just roll with it,
there might be a good spin.

38:34.710 --> 38:36.310
Calling me out?

38:36.310 --> 38:37.550
Easy payday.

38:37.550 --> 38:39.080
Oh yeah? Easier than
your webcam gig?

38:39.080 --> 38:41.950
Crowd: Ohhh!

38:41.950 --> 38:43.320
I saw that.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.420
It's really nice stuff.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.460
Let's dance bean pole..

39:04.970 --> 39:08.710
Luke, I don't know what the hell
happened, man, big problem.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.510
Big problem!

39:12.050 --> 39:18.620
Luke, I called you
like three hours ago man.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.760
- Easy, broseph, all right?

39:19.760 --> 39:21.620
It's all done.

39:21.630 --> 39:22.860
- What do you mean, what's done?

39:22.860 --> 39:26.630
- The posters, duh.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.030
- You put up the posters?

39:28.030 --> 39:30.970
- That is what you
do with posters.

39:30.970 --> 39:33.700
Beer?

39:33.700 --> 39:36.740
The posters I gave you were,
were ... were a mock up.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.780
A mock up.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.920
I just wanted your help
to design it ...

39:47.920 --> 39:52.760
It wasn't finished, I didn't
want you to put them up yet.

39:52.760 --> 39:58.030
I was gonna tell sheena about my
idea after this ceremony, okay?

39:58.030 --> 40:01.830
Do you know ... she hasn't
agreed to do a retirement match

40:01.830 --> 40:05.670
here, sh- she hasn't given us
permission to put her face u, u-

40:05.670 --> 40:08.900
u, up ... literally everywhere!

40:11.510 --> 40:12.510
- So I messed up.

40:12.510 --> 40:12.510
- Yes, you messed up.

40:12.510 --> 40:18.580
Yes, you royally frickin'
screwed me, is what you did.

40:18.580 --> 40:20.050
She likes to do things her way.

40:20.050 --> 40:22.050
You know that.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.890
She likes to do things on her
terms, and and, and this is

40:24.890 --> 40:31.960
not, uh ... this is
not ... on her terms.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.600
This is not good.

40:34.600 --> 40:39.000
- The posters are already up,
so stop being so scared of her.

40:39.000 --> 40:39.000
- I'm not scared of her.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
- I would say you're acting
like you're scared of her.

40:42.010 --> 40:42.000
No, no, okay.
You know what?

40:42.010 --> 40:45.940
Oh yeah, I'm only going to
say this once and that's it.

40:45.940 --> 40:48.140
I am not scared of
sheena de wilde

40:50.780 --> 40:54.520
- oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.490
Sheena: You trying to wreck
my life, asshole?

40:56.490 --> 40:58.690
- No, no. I can
explain this.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.720
- The whole bloody town is
expecting me to wrestle Friday

41:00.720 --> 41:03.030
for my retirement match.

41:03.030 --> 41:04.230
- What's wrong with that?

41:04.230 --> 41:06.700
- I haven't announced
my retirement yet.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.560
Besides that, though.

41:08.570 --> 41:10.730
- Oh, a retirement match
doesn't make sense here.

41:10.730 --> 41:11.970
It should be in a bigger market.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.170
- Okay, hold on.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.670
I'm going to stop you
right there, okay?

41:14.670 --> 41:17.570
Is that you or is
that tab talking?

41:17.580 --> 41:21.540
Oh, back off!

41:22.610 --> 41:25.180
You back off.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.120
Did I just hurt you?

41:29.120 --> 41:31.520
I'm sorry.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.620
What I said to you was in
confidence and then you went a

41:34.630 --> 41:36.790
broke my trust just like every
shady wrestling promoter I've

41:36.790 --> 41:38.660
worked with for the past decade.

41:38.660 --> 41:40.830
Sheena, this is
your thing, okay?

41:40.830 --> 41:42.700
You get to decide whatever.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.270
You can give the
proceeds to charity.

41:44.270 --> 41:44.270
I don't care.

41:44.270 --> 41:49.000
Sheena, this should be your
thing and you should go out on

41:49.010 --> 41:51.110
your terms, right?

41:54.510 --> 41:56.980
Wouldn't that be cool?

41:58.980 --> 42:02.720
- No.
- Okay.

42:02.720 --> 42:04.950
You leave me with
no choice!

42:04.960 --> 42:11.190
Backyard, now.

42:17.130 --> 42:21.570
Okay, all right.

42:21.570 --> 42:24.970
It goes a little
something like this.

42:24.980 --> 42:29.210
Smasheena, I pin you, okay?

42:29.210 --> 42:30.810
Then you do the match.

42:30.810 --> 42:33.020
Yeah? Oh, I see.

42:33.020 --> 42:35.980
You're afraid the match
isn't choreographed?

42:35.990 --> 42:37.890
Yeah, I get it.

42:39.760 --> 42:40.820
You ready?

42:40.820 --> 42:42.890
Whoo!

42:48.230 --> 42:51.700
Okay, hold on.

42:53.970 --> 42:55.970
Wow, that was intense.

42:55.970 --> 42:55.970
Yeah?

42:55.970 --> 42:57.310
That was awesome, yeah.

42:57.310 --> 42:58.940
For real.

42:58.940 --> 43:04.280
Ah! Aagh! Ooh!

43:04.280 --> 43:08.020
Okay.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.690
Whoa.

43:10.690 --> 43:13.890
Aaagh, oh.

43:18.830 --> 43:23.770
Oh!

43:23.770 --> 43:25.300
- Shit, was that too far?

43:26.840 --> 43:28.240
Oh!

43:28.240 --> 43:30.310
Okay.

43:30.310 --> 43:33.210
I got you, one, two.

43:33.210 --> 43:34.640
Okay.

43:36.650 --> 43:40.380
I'm pinning you.
I'm pinning you.

43:40.380 --> 43:42.750
Okay, okay.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.120
I'll do it, okay.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.990
Yeah

43:47.990 --> 43:50.630
oh.

43:52.060 --> 43:53.960
Why is having my
retirement match here

43:53.960 --> 43:56.100
so goddamned important to you?

43:56.100 --> 43:58.230
Because it's important to you.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.770
Oh bullshit. You
want something.

44:00.770 --> 44:01.800
- What?

44:01.810 --> 44:02.800
- You're just like
everyone else.

44:02.810 --> 44:04.870
- Me?
- Yeah.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.040
I'm sorry, when have
you ever known me

44:06.040 --> 44:07.110
to try to take advantage of you?

44:07.110 --> 44:08.940
Yeah, even St. Corey Swanson

44:08.950 --> 44:11.050
is capable of
hurting someone.

44:11.050 --> 44:13.020
Between the two of us, the only
one I ever see getting hurt

44:13.020 --> 44:14.180
is me.

44:14.180 --> 44:19.320
Oh, oh. Low blow
and not true.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.920
- Oh, so true.
- Holy shit!

44:21.930 --> 44:23.430
- What?
- Oh my god.

44:23.430 --> 44:25.130
What?

44:25.130 --> 44:27.330
- There's wood in
your ass!

44:27.330 --> 44:30.370
What? Did you- aaaagh!

44:30.370 --> 44:30.370
- I'll pull it out.

44:30.370 --> 44:30.370
- Don't touch it, don't
touch it, don't touch it!

44:30.370 --> 44:35.670
You take it out and then there's
an artery and the blood will go

44:35.670 --> 44:36.810
everywhere and I'll die!

44:36.810 --> 44:38.140
- Really? An ass artery?

44:38.140 --> 44:39.840
Yes, there's an
ass artery, okay?

44:39.840 --> 44:41.380
There's such a thing
as an ass artery.

44:41.380 --> 44:42.880
- There's no such thing
as an ass artery.

44:42.880 --> 44:44.280
- Yes, and it's in the
left butt cheek, okay?

44:44.280 --> 44:44.280
I could die.

44:44.280 --> 44:47.720
Oh, I can feel it now, now
that I know it's there!

44:47.720 --> 44:49.380
What do I do? What do i
do? What do I do?

44:49.390 --> 44:50.990
- Call the doctor!

44:55.260 --> 44:57.730
Did you even look
at the picture?

45:01.300 --> 45:03.270
My first costume.

45:03.270 --> 45:04.370
Grade 11?

45:04.370 --> 45:06.000
- Yep.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.840
God, I look like such a dork.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.240
So dorky.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.410
You helped design it.

45:10.410 --> 45:13.810
I helped with it.

45:20.220 --> 45:22.420
What?

45:22.420 --> 45:25.020
A scar.

45:28.290 --> 45:34.360
Be nice to hear what
happened from you.

45:34.360 --> 45:39.370
There's a lot of stuff flying
around over the years.

45:40.270 --> 45:41.740
- Yeah.

45:41.740 --> 45:45.170
- Only if you're
comfortable with it.

45:45.180 --> 45:47.380
- I'm sort of the farthest thing
from comfortable at the moment,

45:47.380 --> 45:51.180
but yeah, okay.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.490
I was walking home.

45:56.490 --> 46:00.960
That was a few days
after you left.

46:02.930 --> 46:05.360
I found myself in our old spot.

46:08.430 --> 46:13.140
There were these guys.

46:13.140 --> 46:16.040
I think they were just having
fun, but one of the guys

46:16.040 --> 46:17.810
must have spotted me.

46:17.810 --> 46:21.840
Man, he started
shouting like a maniac.

46:21.850 --> 46:23.410
- What'd he say?

46:23.410 --> 46:24.550
Nothing. He didn't
say anything.

46:24.550 --> 46:25.910
- Cory, come on.
What did he say?

46:25.920 --> 46:27.280
It wasn't crazy.

46:27.280 --> 46:30.850
Just this little voice he was
doing was like...

46:30.850 --> 46:34.860
Hey, sheena dewilde,
will you marry me?

46:34.860 --> 46:40.130
Marry me, marry me, marry me.

46:42.500 --> 46:45.000
Ooh!

46:46.570 --> 46:49.910
I slipped and fell.

46:49.910 --> 46:52.370
This nice family found me.

46:52.380 --> 46:56.440
I guess the word spread
that I had jumped.

46:57.510 --> 47:03.990
Anyway, after that,
i became that guy.

47:06.260 --> 47:11.430
The guy that got so
depressed that he

47:11.430 --> 47:15.360
botched a marriage proposal and
then he decided to kill himself.

47:19.900 --> 47:24.270
So, I hurt you again
without even being here.

47:24.270 --> 47:26.210
- What? No, what are
you talking?

47:26.210 --> 47:28.880
That's ridiculous.
It's not on you.

47:29.950 --> 47:32.310
Okay, look, I know nobody in
this entire frigging town

47:32.320 --> 47:35.980
believes me, not even my
own mother believes,

47:35.990 --> 47:40.220
but I need you to just- oh, wow.

47:40.220 --> 47:42.290
I need you to listen to
me for two seconds, okay?

47:42.290 --> 47:46.290
I'm dead serious when I say i
did not try to kill myself,

47:46.300 --> 47:52.270
okay?
-Okay.

47:52.270 --> 47:55.270
Right, I've seen a lot of this.

47:55.270 --> 47:57.210
Sex toy mislaunched?

48:02.650 --> 48:04.380
God!

48:07.620 --> 48:10.090
You kids are sick.

48:14.020 --> 48:18.630
Okay, so all proceeds can go to
my sister's art therapy charity.

48:18.630 --> 48:21.530
Let's do it.
- Come on, no.

48:21.530 --> 48:23.500
If you're going to do this whole
thing out of pity then you

48:23.500 --> 48:24.470
shouldn't do it.

48:24.470 --> 48:26.170
- I'm not doing it out of pity.

48:26.170 --> 48:29.970
I'm doing it because I want to.

48:29.970 --> 48:33.110
All right? Let's put
on a good show.

48:33.610 --> 48:35.140
Deal?

48:36.980 --> 48:38.280
Yeah, deal.

48:38.280 --> 48:41.120
Cool.

48:43.390 --> 48:46.590
Good night.

48:54.160 --> 48:56.400
Night.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.240
What does your sister pull in?

49:03.240 --> 49:05.440
Sixty? Seventy a year?

49:08.240 --> 49:10.450
She could do better.

49:13.380 --> 49:17.520
So we're doing the retirement
match here after all.

49:32.570 --> 49:34.270
I'm only going to say this once.

49:34.270 --> 49:36.670
- We haven't even spoken to
anybody about my mail-outs yet

49:36.670 --> 49:39.140
- are you high again, Carl?

49:39.140 --> 49:41.580
- It's Luke and yeah,
I'm a little buzzed.

49:41.580 --> 49:44.680
- Can always spot a weed man.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.510
- I'm late, what's up?

49:46.520 --> 49:48.450
- Nothing.

49:48.450 --> 49:51.490
I don't know.

49:51.490 --> 49:56.090
Yeah, did we want to
discuss any business stuff.

49:56.090 --> 49:59.490
I could just jump into...

49:59.500 --> 50:01.160
We don't have to be
formal or anything.

50:01.160 --> 50:05.530
- If your wrestling people,
puke or shit or urine anywhere

50:05.540 --> 50:10.010
that's not in toilet, you
will pay to clean it up.

50:10.010 --> 50:13.780
No ifs or buts, none.

50:15.410 --> 50:17.410
- Bruno raises a valid point.

50:17.410 --> 50:20.750
He's had a few tough nights
janitorially speaking.

50:20.750 --> 50:23.220
- So much urine.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.590
- Maybe talk to the boys
about their accuracy.

50:26.590 --> 50:28.420
Yeah, that's pretty disgusting.

50:28.430 --> 50:31.790
Cool, we can like monitor
the bowel movements somehow.

50:31.800 --> 50:32.730
The audience is best we can.

50:32.730 --> 50:32.730
What now?

50:32.730 --> 50:34.700
I'm not working with
Horatio anymore.

50:34.700 --> 50:35.800
What?

50:35.800 --> 50:37.230
Yes, you are.

50:37.230 --> 50:38.470
Can I be serious for a minute?

50:38.470 --> 50:39.330
He's dead weight.

50:39.340 --> 50:40.670
Hey, I am not dead weight.

50:40.670 --> 50:41.670
Get the hell out of here.

50:41.670 --> 50:42.770
I'm tired of carrying you.

50:42.770 --> 50:44.070
You don't need to carry me.

50:44.070 --> 50:45.370
Get out of here. Get
out of my way.

50:45.380 --> 50:47.180
Make me, huh?

50:53.420 --> 50:55.280
Boom. Gone.

50:55.290 --> 50:56.480
This bickering.

50:56.490 --> 50:56.480
You know what it reminds me of?

50:56.490 --> 51:01.820
'85, I'm in Mexico City, working
with El chupacabra, place is

51:01.830 --> 51:05.590
sold out, 60,000 fans, I'm on
top, working for the strap,

51:05.600 --> 51:10.600
puma comes out of the jungle,
bites off a piece of my ear -

51:10.600 --> 51:14.770
there's that bad boy, I not
only finish the match, I win it,

51:14.770 --> 51:17.340
keep the strap, and i
get free Margarita mix

51:17.340 --> 51:19.170
for the rest of the night.

51:19.180 --> 51:20.310
Morning everyone.

51:20.310 --> 51:21.340
Corey, what's up?

51:21.340 --> 51:22.580
Great day, huh?

51:22.580 --> 51:23.680
Hi.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.650
Tab hennessy, pleasure.
Tab hennessy

51:26.650 --> 51:27.650
- hello.

51:27.650 --> 51:31.290
- Wow. Wow. Boom.

51:31.290 --> 51:33.620
If it isn't baron Von
brashton himself.

51:33.620 --> 51:34.560
Big fan, sir.

51:34.560 --> 51:34.560
- Thank you.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.720
- That cage match in
Pittsburgh in '95?

51:36.730 --> 51:36.720
- Sold out.

51:36.730 --> 51:39.530
- Sold out? That was a
heart-stopper.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.400
Guess who was working
on top that night?

51:41.400 --> 51:43.230
- This guy.
- This guy. Boom.

51:43.230 --> 51:45.500
That guy.

51:45.500 --> 51:47.470
Well hello, there, young lady.

51:47.470 --> 51:48.840
I'm tab.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.140
Tab hennessy, and i
love your sweater.

51:51.710 --> 51:54.640
Those are mittens, tab.

51:54.640 --> 51:55.740
Sorry, I interrupted?

51:55.750 --> 51:55.740
Yes.

51:55.750 --> 51:59.610
Yes. We were just ... I was
just about to launch

51:59.620 --> 52:01.880
into a few
things.

52:01.890 --> 52:05.550
- So, I ... my favourite
seats, they're in row 6.

52:05.560 --> 52:05.550
- Yes.

52:05.560 --> 52:10.260
- But 6a through 6g, the
whole row is a little wonky.

52:10.260 --> 52:11.430
- Seats are fine
the way they are.

52:11.430 --> 52:12.430
Yes.

52:12.430 --> 52:12.430
- Seats are totally fine.

52:12.430 --> 52:15.430
Yes, no, I love those seats,
they're my favourite seats.

52:15.430 --> 52:18.670
And what about pyrotechnics?

52:18.670 --> 52:21.400
Is there any way- funny story.

52:21.400 --> 52:25.370
We had a fuel spill here, back
in 2000, you put pyro,

52:25.380 --> 52:26.570
this whole place goes up.

52:26.580 --> 52:28.810
Boom like a box of kindling.

52:28.810 --> 52:30.450
Don't want to blow everybody up.

52:30.450 --> 52:31.410
Can I have a look?

52:34.280 --> 52:35.520
Mm-hmm.

52:36.250 --> 52:36.250
Yes.

52:40.220 --> 52:42.560
Hm. Wow. You put a lot of
thought into this,

52:42.560 --> 52:43.790
but here's the problem, Corey.

52:43.790 --> 52:45.730
Can I call you Corey?

52:45.730 --> 52:47.830
I don't fault your
passion, at all.

52:47.830 --> 52:50.570
But I did a quick tour here,
earlier, and this pavilion is

52:50.570 --> 52:52.800
kind of, no
offence intended

52:52.800 --> 52:53.770
- it's a shit-hole.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.440
Hey, no shit.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.570
I don't want to step on
anyone's toes, but I have a few

52:57.570 --> 52:59.840
alternative ideas, if
anyone cares to hear them.

53:05.680 --> 53:08.850
Finally, and I promise we can
move on after this last point,

53:08.850 --> 53:11.520
I check the breaker board,
the light show Corey here's

53:11.520 --> 53:14.620
proposing, it'll
blow the circuit.

53:14.620 --> 53:16.190
May even cause a fire.

53:16.190 --> 53:16.820
- Could've killed us all.

53:16.830 --> 53:18.290
- Could've.

53:18.300 --> 53:20.460
- We'll need two 6,500-watt
gas generators.

53:20.460 --> 53:22.760
One out front, and one out back.

53:25.500 --> 53:28.200
Tab should be in charge.

53:28.210 --> 53:29.370
Oh, guys, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:29.370 --> 53:30.910
I can't organise.

53:30.910 --> 53:33.270
I can barely find my
pants in the morning.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.440
You're in a really
nice suit right now.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.440
Quiet, quiet.

53:35.450 --> 53:37.250
The tab is talking.

53:38.750 --> 53:40.380
- Okay, where is your vip area?

53:40.380 --> 53:43.280
- We don't have a vip area.

53:43.290 --> 53:44.990
This is athletic
dancing at its finest.

53:44.990 --> 53:45.890
We need a vip area.

53:45.890 --> 53:45.890
- Okay. Done.

53:45.890 --> 53:48.490
- That whole front row there,
section that off,

53:48.490 --> 53:49.290
that's our vip area.

53:49.290 --> 53:49.920
- Bruno, vip area.

53:49.930 --> 53:51.430
- Very good. Vip.

53:51.430 --> 53:52.890
- These electronics on this
table, are these

53:52.900 --> 53:54.260
plugged into the intercom?

53:54.260 --> 53:55.000
I don't have a clue.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.360
Bruno?

53:56.370 --> 53:57.470
I'll make sure that they are.

53:57.470 --> 53:57.470
Okay, please do that.

53:57.470 --> 53:59.900
Now, where do your athletes
enter around here?

53:59.900 --> 53:59.900
- Wrestlers?

53:59.900 --> 54:02.800
- The athletes, yes.
- Down there.

54:02.810 --> 54:04.310
- Down here? Okay. We
need a red carpet.

54:04.310 --> 54:05.910
Sheena enters with a red carpet.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.710
Why the hell is there no
red carpet down there?

54:07.710 --> 54:10.310
- What?
- Okay. Okay.

54:10.310 --> 54:13.880
- Who's the beast?

54:13.880 --> 54:15.450
- Oh, hey, that's...
- Don't touch me.

54:15.450 --> 54:19.650
Okay. That's Renee partridge.

54:19.660 --> 54:19.650
- Please don't touch me.

54:19.660 --> 54:24.290
- Sure. He drives the giant hot
dog truck down the street

54:24.290 --> 54:26.960
- yeah. His handle is
merciless mordecai.

54:36.410 --> 54:38.710
Hey, hey, that doesn't go there.

54:38.710 --> 54:38.710
Put it up higher.

54:38.710 --> 54:41.910
- Really going to let that
pretty boy get in your way?

54:41.910 --> 54:43.780
- That pretty boy just took
over the entire thing.

54:43.780 --> 54:45.050
- Back, there perfect.

54:45.050 --> 54:47.050
- I mean, I had a
solid plan. You know?

54:47.050 --> 54:50.750
Everybody's looking at me like
I'm a mass murderer, it's crazy.

54:50.750 --> 54:52.050
Look at him, he's
so manipulative.

54:52.060 --> 54:53.690
What is he doing right now?

54:53.690 --> 54:54.960
- Tabloom hennessy the third.

54:56.660 --> 54:58.290
Man with amazing cheekbones and
the most chiseled earlobes

54:58.300 --> 54:59.290
I've ever seen.

54:59.300 --> 55:02.530
You know, I had to fight the
urge to kiss him on the mouth

55:02.530 --> 55:04.870
when he was talking earlier.

55:05.630 --> 55:07.770
- You're cute too.

55:07.770 --> 55:10.540
- I get it, I do. Okay?
Figure something out.

55:10.540 --> 55:13.340
- Nah, forget it.

55:13.340 --> 55:15.310
I'll make sure he's
out of the picture.

55:15.310 --> 55:17.550
God, look at these girls.

55:17.550 --> 55:18.950
They need my help.

55:18.950 --> 55:21.650
- What do you mean,
out of the picture?

55:21.650 --> 55:22.750
I'm on it.

55:22.750 --> 55:23.850
That sounded weirdly
threatening.

55:23.850 --> 55:25.650
- Yo, Andrea.

55:25.660 --> 55:27.420
- Luke, Luke, I can
handle him.

55:27.420 --> 55:28.320
Luke.

55:28.330 --> 55:30.760
We need to talk.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.930
Luke, I can
handle him, Luke.

55:38.700 --> 55:40.000
Like this.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.340
Oh. See that?

55:42.340 --> 55:44.370
- I love this town.

55:44.370 --> 55:47.510
So pumped about the
timing of this, Corey.

55:47.510 --> 55:50.410
Me being here for this, I can
really put my thumbprint on it.

55:50.410 --> 55:52.680
Make it a night people
remember for years.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.450
I'm going to
transform this place.

55:56.090 --> 55:57.550
- That's cool.

55:57.550 --> 56:00.050
That's sort of sheena's
thing, though, right?

56:00.060 --> 56:02.120
- Who else should it be for?

56:02.130 --> 56:04.090
- I don't know.

56:04.090 --> 56:08.660
Just sort of used the word
"i" a lot just then.

56:11.730 --> 56:13.900
We're going to be
like that, are we?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.840
Voices from ring:
Good, Thursday.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.770
All right.

56:19.780 --> 56:21.040
Elbow.

56:21.040 --> 56:23.710
Okay? Like this.

56:23.710 --> 56:24.650
Right?

56:24.650 --> 56:29.980
Okay?

56:29.990 --> 56:31.090
Like this, right?

56:31.090 --> 56:32.090
You've got to get some speed.

56:32.090 --> 56:33.150
Yes, no, no, that's good.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.020
That's good.

56:35.020 --> 56:35.020
- Thank you.

56:35.020 --> 56:38.530
Yes, that was a very
informative tutorial.

56:38.530 --> 56:39.660
- Yes, I thought so.

56:39.660 --> 56:42.900
- Hey, why are you doing this?

56:42.900 --> 56:44.900
- I want to make your
performance more believable.

56:44.900 --> 56:44.900
- Now, headlock...

56:44.900 --> 56:49.440
- No, I mean,
what's in it for you?

56:49.440 --> 56:51.470
- What do you mean?

56:51.470 --> 56:55.080
- You and Corey barely knew
each other in high school.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.450
Mm-hmm.

56:58.450 --> 57:05.450
I just want you to know that if
you put one toe out of line,

57:05.460 --> 57:07.190
I will break your limbs.

57:07.190 --> 57:09.520
And then bury you alive.

57:09.530 --> 57:11.930
You read me?

57:11.930 --> 57:14.130
- Yes.

57:15.430 --> 57:17.730
- Why don't you take a
shot at me?

57:17.730 --> 57:18.900
- What?

57:18.900 --> 57:21.600
Yes, yes. Get him
the chair angel

57:21.600 --> 57:22.600
just help me warm up.

57:22.610 --> 57:23.940
- You want me to hit you?

57:23.940 --> 57:26.070
- Yes. It would
really help me out.

57:26.080 --> 57:30.140
- Oh, I don't know.
With a chair?

57:30.150 --> 57:30.140
Mm-hmm.

57:30.150 --> 57:32.910
- You know, I don't feel
comfortable with that,

57:32.920 --> 57:34.750
you being a woman and
me being a man.

57:34.750 --> 57:37.020
- I'm fine with it.

57:37.020 --> 57:39.890
I think I should ... chair shot.

57:39.890 --> 57:40.920
Oh.

57:44.890 --> 57:46.760
Ow.

57:47.700 --> 57:48.960
Nosebleed.

57:48.970 --> 57:49.900
Check that out.

57:49.900 --> 57:53.600
- That's good.
That's good.

57:56.840 --> 57:58.870
Where were you, bud?

57:58.880 --> 58:01.040
I had to run an errand.

58:01.040 --> 58:01.940
You okay?

58:01.950 --> 58:03.080
Yes.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.610
I got blasted in the
face with a chair.

58:04.610 --> 58:05.950
I'm freaking awesome.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.990
Where are you going
with those chairs.

58:15.990 --> 58:19.730
- Put them here.
- No. Put them back here.

58:19.730 --> 58:21.860
Hold up, where are
you going with her?

58:21.870 --> 58:22.900
Over there.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.900
- Is that where she goes?
- Yes.

58:24.900 --> 58:26.530
- Okay. Then get her over there.

58:42.280 --> 58:44.590
Hey, you all right, tab?
- Yes, I'm fine. Fine.

58:48.120 --> 58:50.890
Luke, hey.

58:50.890 --> 58:52.990
Hey, did you do
something to tab?

58:53.000 --> 58:56.800
What did you ... I told
you I could handle him.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.300
What did you do?

58:58.300 --> 59:01.000
- Oh, is he in the hospital?

59:01.000 --> 59:03.940
- What? No. No, he's just...
Has digestive issues,

59:03.940 --> 59:04.940
it looks like.

59:04.940 --> 59:06.870
- Nice.
- What did you do?

59:06.880 --> 59:09.140
- Cut the brakes to his car.
- What?

59:09.150 --> 59:12.650
Yes. He's sick too? Bonus.

59:15.790 --> 59:17.950
Announcer: Beginning of
the end for Horatio.

59:17.950 --> 59:19.320
Pile-driver.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.990
That should do it.

59:20.990 --> 59:21.990
One.

59:21.990 --> 59:22.860
Two.

59:22.860 --> 59:23.690
Three.

59:25.160 --> 59:27.330
Ring the bell.

59:28.060 --> 59:29.230
The winner.

59:35.040 --> 59:38.070
That is a scary
individual, right there.

59:40.580 --> 59:45.750
Crowd: You suck. You suck. You
suck. You suck. You suck.

59:47.620 --> 59:49.750
Mordecai, you cannot
work that stiff

59:49.750 --> 59:51.890
with an old man like Horatio.

59:53.660 --> 59:55.620
Hey, I hear your point and
i don't disagree with you,

59:55.630 --> 59:57.120
but there's a time and a place.

59:57.130 --> 59:59.630
We have guys who
can work that stiff.

59:59.630 --> 01:00:01.760
In my day, I liked
it snug like that.

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:04.870
Can you imagine me and you in my
prime, would have taken every

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.300
puma in Mexico City to town.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.600
Corey.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.070
Corey.

01:00:10.070 --> 01:00:11.270
What?

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.660
I need you to do me a favour.

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.030
What? Oh, yeah, anything.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.660
- Come here.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:35.300
What's up?

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.030
I need you to slap
me in the face.

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:39.930
What?

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:41.370
I just, I need some adrenaline.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:43.240
What are you talk- no.
What? No.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.210
Look, Corey, come on. I do
it on the road all the time.

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:46.710
Just hit me as hard as you can.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:47.640
No.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.680
Corey, I'm asking you to hit me.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.810
- What-
- so hit me.

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.050
I can't hit you.
Are you kidding?

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:52.050
Slap me.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.420
I'm not gonna slap you.
I can't hit you.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:54.420
Corey!
- No.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.820
You're a girl.
I'm not gonna hit you.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.220
Grow a pair and hit me.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.820
Okay.

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:02.360
All right.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.660
I'm gonna hit you.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.090
Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.330
I can't do this!

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.200
- Corey!
- I can't-

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:08.200
slap me! Just do it!

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.800
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, just do it.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:12.000
Ah!

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.170
Ee!

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.100
Ooh!

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.070
Oh!

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:17.670
Shit, sorry.
It's reflex.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.940
It was reflex.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.780
Are you okay?

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:22.310
Hm?

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:22.310
You okay?

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:25.450
Yeah. No, no.
Is that what you said?

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:26.850
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm totally good.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:26.850
Okay.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.720
Totally good.
Was that good enough for you?

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.690
Yeah, actually.

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.720
Best I ever had.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:37.090
Ladies and
gentleman, allow me to introduce

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:39.890
the three-time winner of
the gold medal,

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:43.160
the overseer of all
that's good and true,

01:01:43.170 --> 01:01:46.930
get ready to witness
your Saint, angel!

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.200
Sheena
destruction mode activate.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.300
Three,

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.770
two,

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.810
one.

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:29.940
Smash!

01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.950
Smash!!

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.240
Yeah!

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.550
Come on.

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:09.120
The sold out
pavilion crowd on it's feet,

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:11.990
smasheena can still whip up
a crowd like nobody else.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.930
Angel's not wasting any time.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.400
She wants smasheena bad.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.540
Off those ropes,
smasheena ducks under.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.350
Malfunction at the junction.

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.270
Smasheena, smasheena, smasheena.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:05.470
Boo!

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:15.850
Boo!!!

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.170
One, two ...

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.080
Whoa. What an
upset this would be folks.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.150
Lots of fond
farewells to a legend.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.280
Smasheena, smasheena!

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.460
These two warriors
are leaving it all out there.

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.400
Something's got to give.

01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:07.500
Come on!

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.950
Angel going
for her patent finish.

01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:21.050
Wait, quick reversal.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:22.420
Look out, Nelly!

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:29.360
Smasheena, smasheena!

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.390
Chokeslam, chokeslam.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:43.100
One, two, three!

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:46.070
That's it.
That is all.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.610
You could count to 50.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.140
Smasheena, smasheena!

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:54.210
The winner of
this match, smasheena!

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:02.590
Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena!

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.500
Woohoo!

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.440
You folks want some more?

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.080
I said, you folks
want some more?

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.120
Tomorrow night bring your
ticket stubs back for 25% off.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:31.250
You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:35.490
One more match, one more
match, one more match.

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.120
One more match!

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.660
One more match! One more match!

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:43.600
Konichiwa.

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:47.370
Sheena dewilde, allow
me to introduce ...

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.010
This is Mr. suzuki.
He represents-

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:53.540
extreme Japan wrestling. Oh.

01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:06.250
You're welcome, babe.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.320
Hey, it's business pal.
You understand.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.590
Yeah.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.200
Yeah.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.210
- Read the important stuff!

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:28.080
- All right.
It was a big success.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.380
The community raised
almost $9,000.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.550
- Malcolm!

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.310
- All right.

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:37.280
A top scout from extreme Japan
wrestling is interested in

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:40.150
signing dewilde
to a pro contract.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.320
Another impromptu event is to
be held tomorrow night so the

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:46.290
President of the company
can see her in action.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.060
I thought you were
going to relax?

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.730
Mothers don't have that luxury.

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:02.340
Oh, easy there, jumpy friend.
You okay?

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:05.550
Yeah, totally fine.
You just scared me. Hey.

01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:06.380
Hey.

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.120
Why you guys cabbing it?

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.220
Somebody lock their
keys in the car, or ...?

01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.420
It was the weirdest thing.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.120
Mechanic told me that
someone cut my coolant line.

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:18.729
It happens though, right.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:21.859
What are you doing out here?

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:24.430
Oh, I don't know.
Actually I was just riding

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:27.229
and I guess I lost
track of where I am.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:29.240
Hello?

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.609
Tab's going
to Cleveland today.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:32.740
- No way!
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:32.740
Going to Cleveland,
that's awesome.

01:08:32.740 --> 01:08:36.710
I've never been to Cleveland.
That's cool. Why is he going?

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:39.710
Some hot shot kid is
killing out there so he wants

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.319
to book him for
my farewell match.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.520
- That'd be awesome.
- Yeah.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.250
Oh, we should grab a drink then.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:49.490
Yeah, yeah. My sister's
place actually is just-

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:52.229
sheena. Got to go.
Next flight out.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.760
Oh, okay, well actually you can
take the cab because Corey's

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.300
going to walk me home.

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:56.800
Yeah.
A little celebratory drink.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.330
For Japan.

01:08:58.330 --> 01:08:59.729
Yeah, so I'll see you tomorrow.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.830
Travel safe.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.569
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:05.270
Cleveland, that's awesome man.
Konichiwa!

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.210
Bye.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.819
Here you go.
- Wow, this is fancy.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.290
Yeah. Cheers.

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:21.760
Yeah.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:30.460
Wow.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:40.609
That's bourbon,
so you're supposed to sip it.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.580
Oh. Yes.

01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:48.620
That makes sense because
that's really ... intense.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:53.290
It's on fire right now.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.290
Oh, yeah.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.330
So if all goes well with the
match tomorrow then you leave

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:06.200
forever when, exactly?

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.400
I have ... I don't even know.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.210
I'm not there yet.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:18.910
God, Japan. It's weirdly
perfect though, don't you-

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.750
I mean, can't you see me there?

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.750
Yeah, totally.
It'd be weirdly perfect for you.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.850
See, you get me.

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.370
This place is really ni--
oh, woah,

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.700
ow! I did ...

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.470
I just stood up to fast.

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.340
You're not
riding your bike home.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.680
You can stay here.

01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:52.950
Well, laying down.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:03.290
You look really gross
in this dim lighting.

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:12.430
I hate being here with you,
now, in this very moment.

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:14.670
It's really awful.
- Right this second.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.770
It's terrible.

01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:16.770
Guys!

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:17.600
- Oh!
- Jesus!

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:19.540
Evelyn, oh.

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.840
Okay, yep.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:26.550
So I bumped into tab.
I am so excited for you.

01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:28.050
You bumped into him where?

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:29.680
Now I have a place
to stay in Japan.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:30.980
Can you imagine?

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.420
Yeah, I guess we'll see
how it goes tomorrow.

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:38.830
Sweet. Good talk.
Okay. Bedtime.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:41.060
Okay, yep.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.730
Good night.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:47.800
Yeah, good night.
It was fun.

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.870
I had a good time.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.660
I'm sorry.

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:09.990
Did I scare you?

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.630
What? No.

01:12:12.630 --> 01:12:15.500
Yes, a little bit,
actually, but it's okay.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.560
I was just making a sandwich,
and I remembered how big

01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:18.970
of a loser you are.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:20.900
Oh.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.910
I even though about pouring
burning hot bacon fat all

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:27.640
over you while
you were sleeping,

01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:30.810
how deformed your
little face would be.

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.380
I'm gonna go.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:39.350
So help me, if you even
think about putting the moves

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.390
on my sister again or
proposing marriage or

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.090
whatever you're gonna do.

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:45.390
Do you have any idea how
embarrassing that was for me?

01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:48.460
For you?
That was embarrassing for you?

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.030
Oh, wow, that's crazy,
because, see, for me it wa-

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:55.540
I am not interested.

01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:01.480
Got it, okay.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.380
Tell your sister
I'll see her later.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.620
Sure a lot of anger
in this house.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.650
Hey, I'm looking for
the Russian bison.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.420
- Are you from the beauty salon?

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:46.120
Swanson.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.890
My apologies, just--

01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:50.460
- no, you don't.
I've got a groupon.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.160
You have a- oh, okay. Okay.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.130
- Come on.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.770
Towel.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:04.140
Oh, yeah, thanks.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.670
Congratulations on Japan.
Excited?

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.740
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:15.220
Must be hard going through life
wrecking everything you touch.

01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:20.850
Mrs. Swanson.

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.660
We're not going
through this again.

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.960
I don't know what you're--

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:29.130
no, no.

01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:33.070
Okay, this is weird,
so I'm gonna go.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.710
Do you know what his
life has been like since

01:14:39.710 --> 01:14:40.810
you've been gone?
- Jesus.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.510
Yeah, people have moved on.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.240
Did he tell you
about the billboard?

01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.210
Yeah.
Some jackoff yelled at him.

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.050
He was startled,
and then he fell.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.550
What about the
mental institution?

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:01.230
Oh, wait.

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:02.760
Excuse me.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.000
Look at this.
Obviously you're getting pretty

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.740
slack there in the
kitchen there, Dennis.

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.570
I mean, I'll still eat this,

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:13.710
but I think you should
give me a discount.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.610
No?

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.610
I'm not gonna pay for this.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:28.820
Oh, hey.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.690
Andrea, I mean,
sheen, sheen, sheena.

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:33.930
You Luke?

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:35.660
Oh, what can I do for you?

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:41.270
You're a really good friend to
Corey, and I pegged you wrong.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.640
It's actually really comforting
to know that he's got this

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.040
support system here,
especially if I go to Japan.

01:15:52.580 --> 01:15:53.980
Well, yeah, totally.

01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:57.120
I mean, we're buds, right?

01:15:58.090 --> 01:15:59.720
Me and Corey are buds.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.920
We're buds.

01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:04.960
I gotta ask you something.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.060
Mm-hmm?

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:10.560
I'm just super confused because
everyone is saying that he

01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:13.730
jumped off the billboard, but
then Corey's telling me that

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.270
there was these guys yelling
stuff from their motorbikes.

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:19.040
And, like, what, what happened?

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.640
Do you know?

01:16:27.850 --> 01:16:32.120
It was a long time ago,
you know, so, you know,

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.620
I don't- I don't remember.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.820
Hey, can you pass the salt?

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.060
You okay?

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.800
Yeah, I'm frickin awesome.

01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:48.640
I gotta take a piss.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.340
Don't suppose you could put me
into a figure-four leg lock.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.850
Not today.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:01.050
Oh, okay.

01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:26.340
Aaaahh! Ah!

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.270
It was you that day, wasn't it?

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280
Ah!
- Tell me the truth!

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.010
- Gah!
- Tell me!

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:33.150
God!

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.890
Uh!

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.200
Hey.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.700
Hey.
- Hi.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:53.970
What happened to you last night?

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.840
Yeah, sorry.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:59.940
Yeah, I should've said goodbye.
I actually had this really

01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:07.180
weird nightmare, burning hot
bacon fat all over my face.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.980
- What?
- Got all deformed. Stupid.

01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:12.890
I had a good time last night.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.360
Have you seen Luke?
I've been calling him,

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.300
and we have stuff to do,
and he's nowhere to be seen.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.070
Have you seen him?

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.830
No.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.240
What?

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:32.210
Nothing.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.380
Jesus.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.380
Did you get that from wrestling?

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:44.350
No, I didn't.

01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:50.020
Why are you being weird?

01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:51.830
Then what is it from?

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.460
He confessed, Corey.

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.770
He's the one that shouted
at you from the bikes.

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:06.410
What?
I'm sorry, did you ...

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.980
Did you beat it out
of him or something?

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.510
He's not your real
friend, Corey.

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:14.180
He's only helping you
because he feels guilty.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.080
That sounds familiar.

01:19:18.090 --> 01:19:19.920
What- okay, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.420
Why are you mad at me? He's-

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.320
who do you think are
you are, coming back here and

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.790
meddling in my life?

01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:27.960
He's my friend, okay?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:30.860
Look.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.370
I know about the
psychiatric hospital, okay?

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.780
What, did Evelyn tell you that?

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.080
No, your mom.

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.010
You went to my mother?

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.050
She came to me, okay?
She was worried about you.

01:19:51.050 --> 01:19:53.350
Oh, you're unbeliev-
you're unreal!

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:58.090
I didn't know, Corey.
If I knew, I would've come back.

01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:00.490
I didn't need you
to come back, okay?

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.100
I don't need you to
come save me, all right?

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:05.200
It was a stress clinic, okay?

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.200
And my mom checked me in there,
and I stayed to appease her

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.840
because she's crazy, and you
know that, and I was there for a

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.870
total of 48 friggin hours.

01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:15.540
Well, your 'friend' is
the reason you fell.

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.940
Why do you think I was up
there to begin with, hm?

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:25.450
You said in the hospital
that it wasn't because of me.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.320
Yeah, look, I know what I said.
Okay?

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.420
I don't know if I was up there
and I was going to jump.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:29.420
I don't even know.

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:29.420
I don't know what
i was thinking. All right?

01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:35.130
Except for some really dark
shit because I was 18 years old

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.960
and you broke my heart.

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:41.330
Cool. Yeah, okay.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:45.040
Well, I have the
biggest match of my life,

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.610
so I don't know how I'm
supposed to do that if-

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.610
get over yourself. Just get over
yourself, all right?

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:50.180
You were never worth killing
myself over and you definitely

01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:52.380
weren't worth all of this.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.330
I'm done. I'm not
thinking about her anymore.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:10.160
I'm not thinking or talking
about her every again.

01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:13.470
Not one more moment after this
moment right now where I'm

01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.070
talking and thinking about her.

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.870
That's it.
That's the last one.

01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.010
Hey.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.180
Hey.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.250
You've still got me

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:38.060
and if you want to
start seeing me

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.560
regularly, again,
we can arrange that.

01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.900
Okay, so, I explained
everything.

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.200
Are you sure you're okay here?

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.240
Absolutely, yeah.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.300
Okay.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:51.970
All right.

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:01.410
Yeah, so, you know, just don't
unplug this cooler at all.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:04.050
Ever. Day and night
leave it running and

01:22:04.050 --> 01:22:06.150
don't eat the jelly salt,
that stuff is disgusting.

01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:07.450
If I put my hand right here.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.360
No! No! No!
Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.660
I'm just kidding. I'm kidding,
Corey. Kidding. Kidding.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.690
Ha-ha-ha. That's the no-hands
zone. Okay. All right.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.300
You be careful. She's a tricky
devil, don't lose a limb.

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.300
Good luck.

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.360
Plan b, you're fighting Horatio.

01:22:51.730 --> 01:22:53.700
Okay, what about the
guy in Cleveland.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.340
He made me shave his back.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:58.270
Never mind.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.310
Why are you so tense?

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.640
Just, it looks like a sellout.

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:06.980
Yeah, well, I had to show
watanabee you're a global draw.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.180
Just do what you do best
and we're set for life.

01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:14.490
Look, I know that Japan
is important to you ...

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.260
This is everything
you've ever wanted.

01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.690
I went out and I got it for you.

01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.770
Is this because of him?

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.570
Because if it is,
i don't know whether I

01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:31.240
should be angry or laugh.

01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:39.180
Yeah, wait, uh, yeah.

01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:42.050
Hey, jan?

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:44.120
Is this the right baguette?

01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.350
Malcolm, now you know you can't
come barging in here like this.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:49.060
I'm sorry.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:54.760
Thank you for bringing the
groceries, like I asked,

01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.530
very nice of you.
On your way now.

01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:01.170
Ah, well, you're
welcome, Ms. Swanson.

01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:02.140
Mm-hmm.

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:03.500
See you, Corey.

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:05.370
See you.

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:06.710
Bye-bye now.

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:08.040
- Bye.

01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:20.150
How about that? Just
negotiated you a signing bonus.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:22.290
Right there. Two minutes.

01:24:22.290 --> 01:24:24.090
What do you think Swanson
was up to in that time?

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:28.330
Look, I appreciate
all your help.

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:30.430
I do, and I want this Japan deal
also, but could you just like

01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:32.800
give me some space?

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.800
Just have a lot on my mind.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.240
Well, excuse me for trying
to better our lives.

01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:39.510
Let's just talk after
the match, okay?

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:42.440
Let's be clear,
i got you this opportunity

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.710
and I can take it away.

01:24:44.850 --> 01:24:46.380
Oh, really?

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:48.310
What? You think i
don't deserve my due,

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.250
after all the shit
i put up with handling you?

01:24:50.250 --> 01:24:52.220
Holding your hand in rehab.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.150
Getting you on a reality show.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.790
Building up your wrestling
credentials only to have you

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.720
start having feelings
again for some pathetic little

01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.760
waste of skin.

01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:10.140
I appreciate all that
you've done for my career.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.140
Thank you.

01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:14.610
Your career?

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:15.710
Mm-hmm.

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:17.880
What about us?

01:25:22.620 --> 01:25:24.620
It's like that is it?

01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:27.690
Fine.

01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:44.400
Hey.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:46.740
Hey.

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:52.280
You know how I've
been trying to ...

01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:59.720
I feel like shit, man,

01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:04.260
and I just wanted you to
win one. You know? Just once.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.190
You know, get the girl.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:13.830
I should've apologised
for the billboard.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.440
Everything.

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:25.410
I'm sorry, bud.

01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:27.780
Okay?

01:26:32.890 --> 01:26:34.490
Cool.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.820
So you're not going
to the big match?

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:41.390
No.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.230
I saw through the
window you were eating.

01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.500
You know?
What are you eating?

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.850
Hot chocolate for my boys.

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:10.490
All right.
This is ridiculous, Janet.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.490
We can't do this anymore.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.730
- Mr. Kirby, really, you can't-
- no, no, Janet. Please. Enough.

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:13.730
Why the hell aren't
you at that match?

01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:17.700
- Malcolm, this isn't-
-now I know this isn't my place.

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.670
I know you're not my wife.
He's not my son.

01:27:20.670 --> 01:27:22.600
I'm just the friendly
neighbour, right?

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.310
Yeah, well, I'm the friendly
neighbour who has been nailing

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:28.470
your mother for
the last 11 years.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:29.610
Classic.

01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:33.480
Hey, Malcolm.
I knew that.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.250
You did?

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.250
Yeah.

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:41.890
Why do you think I keep asking
for earplugs for Christmas?

01:27:41.890 --> 01:27:43.620
Oh, my word.

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:46.760
Okay, good.

01:27:57.300 --> 01:28:00.570
And her opponent
from the netherworld,

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:05.710
weighing 300 pounds, 'merciless'
mordecai.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.380
You can't sit
here eating cereal

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.380
and expect to be with that girl.

01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.420
I don't expect to
be with the girl.

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.390
The girl is never
going to be with me.

01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:49.720
Okay? I tried,
so why bother anymore?

01:28:51.630 --> 01:28:53.360
- Okay.

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.860
Okay, let me get this straight,
she's gone, forever,

01:29:00.670 --> 01:29:03.370
and you're back
working at the deli-

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.010
forever.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.380
Are you good with that?

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:15.750
He's right.

01:29:17.380 --> 01:29:20.650
That creepy old man, who's
nailing your mom, he's right.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:23.390
You're wrong.

01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.500
Yeah! Woo!

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.460
Now's the time!

01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:41.110
Things going
bad to worse for smasheena.

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:57.720
Come on, guys.
She's getting her ass kicked.

01:29:57.730 --> 01:29:59.060
Corey, you've got
to do something.

01:30:05.770 --> 01:30:07.800
Mordecai living
up to his name,

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.740
showing smasheena no mercy.

01:30:26.650 --> 01:30:28.850
Locks in the "crab,"
this could be it.

01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:34.530
Oh.

01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:39.570
Oh, this smells like ass.

01:30:39.570 --> 01:30:40.870
Oh, this is disgusting.

01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.140
Oh.

01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:47.610
Hey, buddy. Playing a
little bit of dress up?

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:50.540
Oh, god.
Oh, you're a bastard.

01:30:51.710 --> 01:30:54.580
You put mordecai in
the ring with her, man.

01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:59.520
Don't think I don't know you're
trying to screw sheena over.

01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:02.490
What is wrong with you?

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.890
Someone's got to feed the
beast and she's made a poor,

01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:06.690
poor career decision.

01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:08.990
Yeah. No, totally. You know,
but she's sheena, right,

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.060
and she's like really hard
to deal with sometimes.

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:13.930
I was really hoping
things would get physical.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.080
Look like a fracas has
broken out in the crowd.

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:41.590
Smasheena has shown
no offence tonight.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.100
- Hey, that's the douchie
guy from last night.

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:47.930
What's he got against Horatio?

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:49.900
- I had to shave that
guy's back, Corey.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.240
I shaved his back!

01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:55.980
Horatio!

01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.840
Horatio! Horatio!

01:31:59.850 --> 01:32:02.150
Here come the Horatio chants.

01:32:02.150 --> 01:32:03.720
Horatio! Horatio! Horatio!

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.680
He's looking trim, by the way.

01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:07.920
Lost maybe 90 pounds
since last night.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.160
Is that even possible?

01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.590
He's in the ring.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:19.060
Mordecai's looking to finish
smasheena off once and for all.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.770
Kick that guy's ass, Horatio!

01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:31.240
Douche drops an elbow.

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.980
He's saying something to
mordecai, I can't make it out.

01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:39.250
Rake of the eyes!

01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:43.190
Smasheena has the chair,
cracks mordecai with it.

01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:51.160
Finally, smasheena
showing some life.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.070
Woo! Yes!

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:01.310
And so is skinny Horatio.

01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:11.950
Douche into the turnbuckle.

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:14.290
It's chaos in there.

01:33:14.290 --> 01:33:15.990
The ref doesn't know what to do.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:18.990
Mordecai down, so is the douche.

01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:21.030
Skinny guy of his own count.

01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:27.300
Have you ever seen
anything like this, folks?

01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:29.600
Who even won the match?

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:31.200
Who cares at this point?

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.650
Oh, shit.

01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:49.960
Sheena, i--

01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:55.860
ever since you got back
into town I've been trying to--

01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:02.700
muster the courage
to tell you that--

01:34:06.170 --> 01:34:07.640
that I love you.

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:10.680
No!

01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:13.680
Do what you got to do, boy.

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:20.420
If you leave, I want you
to know that I'll be fine.

01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:22.420
You know? I will--

01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:30.800
I will pick myself
up and I'll be okay.

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:49.920
Oh, wow.

01:34:51.690 --> 01:34:54.350
Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena!

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:03.260
I think I have a concussion.

01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:04.860
Eh, you get used to it.

01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:07.000
Good height on that
chokeslam though.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.900
See the leg-whip kick and you
look like a champion out there.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:10.970
Come on. Yeah.

01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:12.740
Smasheena! Smasheena! Smasheena!

01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:14.710
-I sometimes get mixed up in the
ring with my clients. It's this

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:17.780
whole heel/manager character
that I've been working on.

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.920
Can I still come
to Japan? Please?

01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:32.160
No.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:44.100
Aaahhh!!!

01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.480
Okay, fine.
That was fairly romantic.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:55.480
I guess you're not
a humongous loser.

01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:02.120
Corey-

01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:08.860
oh, yeah.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.360
Piledriver. Yeah.
High-five. Yeah.

01:36:12.370 --> 01:36:15.200
Corey, there may have
been a small fire at the

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.370
deli last night.
I'm not sure. I ran out.

01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:19.340
Dr. Hayden, thank you for
your help. I appreciate it.

01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:21.140
Great job out there, Corey.

01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.010
Hey, why don't we all go and
share a nice banana split?

01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:26.480
How about you guys do that and
then I'll hangout another time?

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.450
Cool? Mom, I'm okay. All right?

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:31.950
I kicked that dude's ass
and it was really awesome.

01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:33.950
Yes, it was.

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:35.550
Yes, it was.
It very much was.

01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:38.490
Oh, hey.
- Yeah, sure.

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:41.390
You get the girl
and I get a hotdog,

01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.060
even though it's a
pretty boss hotdog.

01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.060
What happens to me now, huh?

01:36:45.070 --> 01:36:46.870
Where will my life lead?

01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:48.370
You want a job?

01:36:48.370 --> 01:36:50.170
You mean like one of
those working jobs?

01:36:50.170 --> 01:36:51.200
Yeah.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.040
Like for money?

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:53.910
Yeah.

01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:55.440
Yeah? Sure, boom.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.910
Cool.

01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:58.580
Yo, buds, where
do you work again?

01:36:59.050 --> 01:37:00.410
Hi.

01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:02.180
Where'd you get that hotdog?

01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.520
You want my hotdog?

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.490
So, well...

01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:19.030
I just...

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.470
Wait. Stop, wait. Woah.

01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:27.340
Okay, hold on.

01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:28.970
Wow, that's ...

01:37:30.180 --> 01:37:32.950
No, okay, look,
i think you just like-

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:40.850
no, no. Hold on, this is going
to make things a lot harder.

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.090
You understand? Because you
go and now I have this moment

01:37:45.090 --> 01:37:46.990
to think about for
god knows how long.

01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:50.030
I go? But you're coming
with me, you idiot.

01:37:51.060 --> 01:37:52.900
What?
What are you talking about?

01:37:52.900 --> 01:37:55.930
They said that they talked to
you about your crazy character

01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:59.100
and that you're super
excited to come with me.

01:37:59.110 --> 01:38:01.110
Wait, what?
What are you do- ... what?

01:38:01.110 --> 01:38:02.980
Talked to who?
Talked to where? Go where?

01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.310
To Japan with me.

01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:09.380
Don't worry, you're not going to
be like my sidekick or anything.

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.480
Oh.
Oh, wait the people ... I do.

01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:14.520
The people I just met.
We like high-fived.

01:38:15.660 --> 01:38:17.290
Oh, no way!

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:20.530
They want...
Are you kidding they want ...

01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:21.890
Yeah.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.660
I will totally be your sidekick.

01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:25.430
- Great.
- 100%, I will.

01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:27.130
- Absolutely.
- Okay, awesome.
