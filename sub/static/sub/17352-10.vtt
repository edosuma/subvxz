00:09.080 --> 00:11.355
- The world has stopped turning.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.237
The world has stopped turning.

00:13.320 --> 00:17.598
For days now something has been happening
that we haven't seen for a long time.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.797
News and social networks,
the front page of newspapers

00:20.880 --> 00:23.553
are not focusing on evil anymore,

00:24.520 --> 00:25.839
but on good.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.797
Not on war and terrorism,
butonlove.

00:30.360 --> 00:34.512
And all of this thanks to Pius the 13th's
heartbreaking love letters.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.271
The world has stopped turning.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.395
The world has stopped turning.
To talk about love.

23:29.560 --> 23:31.118
- How are you?

23:33.320 --> 23:36.995
- Who, me? I'm always in a good mood.

23:37.680 --> 23:42.674
- I've always associated good mood
with stupidity.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.875
- And not without reason, Your Holiness.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.636
However you can't imagine
the amount of energy

23:48.720 --> 23:52.235
that comes from good mood and stupidity.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.439
- What did you want to tell me?

23:54.520 --> 23:57.910
- I wanted to update you on a survey

23:58.040 --> 24:01.749
in the magazine "Catholic Universe"
that I've been publishing for eight years.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.669
- What is it about?

24:03.840 --> 24:07.958
- We asked a question
to a mixed group of people:

24:08.040 --> 24:12.511
if they'd like to attend
a sermon of the Pope face-to-face.

24:12.880 --> 24:17.670
- How many?
- 99% of all Catholics.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.509
- And would this change things?

24:22.560 --> 24:24.039
- No, Your Holiness.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.279
It wouldn't change things.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.836
A Pope doesn't change people.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.517
- Well, then you're confirming that there is no

24:33.600 --> 24:38.833
good reason for me to appear in public.

24:38.920 --> 24:44.392
- No, actually yes, there is a reason.
- And what would that be?

24:44.600 --> 24:49.390
- If you appear in public, it would help these
people to be in a good mood.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.752
- I'm not a comedian.
- That doesn't matter.

24:52.920 --> 24:56.913
It's the show of being there that helps

24:57.320 --> 24:58.912
- That's not my duty.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.633
- Yes.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.835
Yes, it is.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.399
Your Holiness...

25:10.440 --> 25:12.112
You've changed a lot

25:12.560 --> 25:14.915
since you began your papacy.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.116
- Affliction changes us, Aguirre.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.354
- But good mood doesn't.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.955
- You already knew I had fallen in love
with that woman, didn't you?

39:45.560 --> 39:47.471
Of course you knew it.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.911
I'm an open book to you.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.352
And here we are again

39:53.440 --> 39:55.954
at the same age-old question:

39:56.640 --> 40:01.316
who ever said that a man can't love God
and a woman at the same time?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.679
That's bullshit.

40:09.120 --> 40:12.112
There's one thing I've never understood
aboutyou:

40:12.200 --> 40:16.512
whether you're a Lazio fan like your father
or whether you root for Napoli like I do.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.791
You're unclear on this point.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.513
What?

40:22.960 --> 40:26.077
You want to know what became
of Tonino Pettola?

40:26.400 --> 40:28.356
Look, well...

40:28.840 --> 40:31.434
Tonino Pettola...what happened is that...

40:32.520 --> 40:34.351
Jesus, what an unseemly thing!

40:34.440 --> 40:36.715
I didn't want to, but the Pope...

40:37.160 --> 40:38.912
Basically, Tonino Pe...

40:40.640 --> 40:42.756
Oh God, lwas about to tell you!

40:43.200 --> 40:45.634
No, my friend.
You'll have to forgive me. But I...

40:45.880 --> 40:49.031
I can't tell anyone what became
of Tonino Pettola.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.035
Forgive me, but I can't even tell you,
and you're my best friend.

40:53.400 --> 40:57.791
There are certain secrets so important that
only one person should know them.

40:58.040 --> 41:02.272
Don't resent me for this.
I love you like the son I never had.

41:02.520 --> 41:06.559
But I can never reveal to you what
became of Tonino Pettola.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.430
Merry Christmas, Girolamo.
