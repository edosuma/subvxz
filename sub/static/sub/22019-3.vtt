WEBVTT

00:34.160 --> 00:36.094
[CHAIN RATI'LING]

00:36.130 --> 00:40.066
[DOOR CREAKING]

01:09.700 --> 01:11.691
[MUFFLED GROANING]

01:13.840 --> 01:17.662
[MOANING]

01:17.710 --> 01:20.338
[CRYING OUT]

01:34.820 --> 01:36.378
OH, DAMN IT!

01:36.430 --> 01:40.321
DON'T WORRY. MY FOLKS
HAVE THE KIDS.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.828
[SIGHS] BUT I THOUGHT
I WAS SUPPOSED TO--

01:42.870 --> 01:45.668
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
DROP THEM OFF
AT THEIR PLACE AT 8:00.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.168
MM. YES, BUT YOU LOOKED
SO PEACEFUL LYING THERE,

01:48.200 --> 01:50.907
I MADE THE COMMAND
DECISION THAT
YOU NEEDED YOUR REST.

01:50.940 --> 01:53.829
OHH. WELL, THANK YOU.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.836
I GUESS WITH ALL
THAT'S GOING ON

01:55.880 --> 01:58.678
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,
IT'S FINALLY CATCHING UP TO ME.

01:58.710 --> 02:00.314
SO JACK GARRETT
WAS RIGHT AGAIN.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.683
YOU WEREN'T READY
FOR A DESK JOB.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.847
NO, I WASN'T.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.585
YOU KNOW THE BEST PART

02:07.620 --> 02:09.554
ABOUT YOU GOING FROM
THE INTERNATIONAL

02:09.590 --> 02:11.319
RESPONSE TEAM
TO THE BAU?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.452
WHAT'S THAT?

02:12.500 --> 02:15.458
THAT AFI'ER NEARLY
10 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,

02:18.230 --> 02:19.731
ON A SEMI-REGULAR BASIS.

02:19.770 --> 02:21.635
YEAH.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.699
MMM. [GIGGLES]

02:25.740 --> 02:27.435
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.
I CAN'T BE LATE FOR WORK.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.538
OH, YOU STARTED THIS.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.706
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'M TERRIBLE.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.377
WHAT IF...

02:31.410 --> 02:33.674
WE'RE BOTH LATE FOR WORK?

02:33.720 --> 02:36.644
MMM. MMM--NO, NO.
RAIN CHECK.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.817
SERIOUSLY.
BUT I PROMISE

02:38.850 --> 02:40.249
YOU CAN CASH IN TONIGHT,

02:40.290 --> 02:41.609
BECAUSE MOM ISN'T
DROPPING THE KIDS OFF

02:41.660 --> 02:43.753
TILL TOMORROW MORNING,
REMEMBER?

02:43.790 --> 02:46.327
SO THAT JUST MEANS THAT
WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE

02:46.360 --> 02:48.555
OF EVERY CHANCE
THAT WE GET

02:48.600 --> 02:52.730
FROM NOW UNTIL
TOMORROW MORNING, RIGHT?

02:52.770 --> 02:54.362
YOU THINK?

02:54.400 --> 02:55.560
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
SCREW IT.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.568
YEAH.
YEAH?

02:58.870 --> 03:01.907
SO WHAT IS
THE LINDA PROBLEM?

03:01.940 --> 03:03.476
SEE, I AM TELLING YOU,
SPENCE,

03:03.510 --> 03:05.569
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT
THE LINDA PROBLEM IS

03:05.610 --> 03:06.713
EXCEPT FOR ME AND YOU.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.775
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
A LINDA.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.617
LINDA IS 31 YEARS OLD.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.686
SHE'S SINGLE, OUTSPOKEN,
VERY BRIGHT,

03:12.720 --> 03:14.210
AND MAJORED IN PHILOSOPHY.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.251
IN COLLEGE, SHE FOUND HERSELF
DEEPLY CONCERNED

03:16.290 --> 03:18.281
WITH ISSUES OF DISCRIMINATION
AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,

03:18.330 --> 03:21.652
AND SHE EVEN PARTICIPATED
IN SEVERAL ANTI-NUCLEAR
DEMONSTRATIONS.

03:21.700 --> 03:24.965
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
LINDA DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

03:25.000 --> 03:26.365
MUCH OF A PROBLEM.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.469
LET ME AS YOU THIS.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.694
WHICH ONE SEEMS
MORE PROBABLE?

03:28.740 --> 03:30.367
"A"--THAT LINDA'S
A BANK TELLER,

03:30.410 --> 03:32.401
OR "B," LINDA'S
A BANK TELLER

03:32.440 --> 03:36.399
AND ALSO ACTIVE
IN SOME SORT OF
FEMINIST MOVEMENT?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.907
DO NOT LOOK AT ME.
I HAVE BEEN TELLING HIM

03:38.950 --> 03:42.283
THIS IS GOING TO SAIL
RIGHT OVER THE GENTLE
MINDS AT HIS SEMINAR.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.914
WAIT, I GOT IT.
PROBABILITY.

03:44.950 --> 03:47.851
WHICH MEANS THAT LINDA
IS A BANK TELLER.

03:47.890 --> 03:49.585
VERY GOOD, AND I
EXPECTED AS MUCH,

03:49.630 --> 03:52.292
HOWEVER, THE LINDA PROBLEM
IS AN EXAMPLE

03:52.330 --> 03:53.729
OF THE CONJUNCTION FALLACY,

03:53.760 --> 03:54.829
WHICH HAPPENS WHEN
IT'S ASSUMED THAT

03:54.860 --> 03:56.418
SPECIFIC CONDITIONS
ARE MORE PROBABLE

03:56.470 --> 03:58.290
THAN A SINGLE GENERAL ONE.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.332
AND YOU WANT TO CHALLENGE
THESE ASSUMPTIONS

04:00.370 --> 04:01.598
AT YOUR NEW SEMINAR.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.301
ABSOLUTELY.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.673
GARCIA'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WAY TOO ESOTERIC.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.974
I TOLD YOU.
LOOK, JUST SAY,

04:09.010 --> 04:12.309
"WHEN YOU ASSUME
YOU MAKE AN ASS OF U AND ME,

04:12.350 --> 04:15.046
BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SAY
"ASS" IN A CLASSROOM. HUH?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.640
DETROIT POLICE
NEED OUR HELP.

04:17.690 --> 04:19.510
THIS MORNING, DETROIT POLICE

04:19.560 --> 04:21.448
WERE CALLED TO
AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE,

04:21.490 --> 04:22.718
WHERE THEY
DISCOVERED THE BODY

04:22.760 --> 04:24.887
OF 42-YEAR-OLD CURTIS WYLER.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.898
IT WAS HANGING FROM A MEAT HOOK.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.057
CURTIS WYLER'S HOMICIDE
APPEARS TO BE CONNECTED

04:29.100 --> 04:32.558
TO THE MURDER
OF 27-YEAR-OLD
DARREL FORESTER.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.897
HIS BODY WAS FOUND
TWO WEEKS AGO

04:33.940 --> 04:35.794
UNDER NEARLY
IDENTICAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.967
DUE TO THE STAGES
OF DECOMPOSITION,

04:38.010 --> 04:39.830
THE CORONER HAS NOT
BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE

04:39.880 --> 04:41.609
THE TIME OF DEATH
OR THE CAUSE OF DEATH,

04:41.640 --> 04:44.575
BUT CLEARLY, HE SUFFERED
A LOT OF INJURIES HERE,

04:44.610 --> 04:47.613
AND WHAT REALLY
STOOD OUT TO EVERYBODY

04:47.650 --> 04:52.349
WAS THAT BOTH VICTIMS
HAD BEEN COMPLETELY
CASTRATED.

04:52.390 --> 04:54.813
CASTRATION IS A REMOVAL
OF THE TESTICLES.

04:54.860 --> 04:55.849
IT APPEARS THAT--

04:55.890 --> 04:57.050
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE MISSPOKEN.

04:57.090 --> 04:58.682
I--THEY--I GUESS
TECHNICALLY, THEN,

04:58.730 --> 05:00.755
THEY HAD BEEN
EMASCULATED,
THE WHOLE PACKAGE--

05:00.800 --> 05:02.620
[WHISTLES] GONE.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.491
OK. SO TORTURE
AND SEXUAL MUTILATION.

05:05.530 --> 05:07.031
AND THESE MEN
WEREN'T CONNECTED?

05:07.070 --> 05:08.537
I HAVEN'T HAD
A CRACK AT THEM,

05:09.870 --> 05:11.508
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT STANDS OUT.

05:11.540 --> 05:13.098
WYLER WAS A FANCY
CRIMINAL LAWYER.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.835
FORESTER WAS NEVER
HIS CLIENT.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.700
AND HE WORKED AS
SOME SORT OF ROVING DJ.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.479
WAS EITHER ONE
REPORTED MISSING?

05:18.510 --> 05:19.977
FORESTER WASN'T.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.510
ALTHOUGH HE HAD
NO IMMEDIATE FAMILY

05:21.550 --> 05:23.916
IN THE AREA, MRS. WYLER
CALLED POLICE A WEEK AGO

05:23.950 --> 05:25.542
WHEN HER HUSBAND
DIDN'T COME HOME.

05:25.590 --> 05:27.080
BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS
OF FORCED ENTRY

05:27.120 --> 05:28.883
OR FOUL PLAY
IN HIS OFFICE,

05:28.920 --> 05:30.820
NOR FORESTER'S CONDO.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.725
THERE'S NO BLOOD
AT THESE SCENES, EITHER,

05:32.760 --> 05:34.091
JUST THE BODIES.

05:34.130 --> 05:35.495
THIS UNSUB KNOWS
WHAT HE'S DOING

05:35.530 --> 05:37.862
AND HAS SOMEPLACE
SPECIAL TO DO IT.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.765
YEAH, AND THEN AFI'ER
HE'S HAD HIS FUN,

05:39.800 --> 05:41.665
HE LIKES TO SHOW OFF
HIS HANDIWORK. I MEAN,

05:41.700 --> 05:43.861
CLEARLY THIS GUY'S TRYING
TO SEND SOME KIND OF MESSAGE.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.502
THIS REMINDS ME
OF CARTEL VIOLENCE--

05:45.540 --> 05:47.098
THE BRUTALITY,
THE PUBLIC STAGING.

05:47.140 --> 05:48.801
YOU KNOW, I COME FROM MICHIGAN,

05:48.840 --> 05:50.944
NOT THE MOTOR CITY--
CARSON CITY--

05:50.980 --> 05:52.777
BUT MY FIRST JOB
IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:52.820 --> 05:55.118
WAS IN DETROIT. AND SO
I'M LOOKING AT THIS

05:55.150 --> 05:57.948
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK

05:57.990 --> 05:59.787
AT THE CHALDEAN MAFIA.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.549
THE CALL-TH E-WHO WHAT?

06:01.590 --> 06:03.421
THE CHALDEAN MAFIA
IS AN ASSYRIAN ETHNIC GANG

06:03.460 --> 06:05.018
WITH A CRIMINAL NETWORK
THAT HISTORICALLY

06:05.060 --> 06:06.425
SPANS FROM DETROIT, MICHIGAN,

06:06.460 --> 06:07.927
SOUTHWEST TO SAN DIEGO,
CALIFORNIA.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.894
WHAT REID SAID.

06:09.930 --> 06:12.160
YEAH, BUT I THOUGHT
THE D.A.'s OPERATION
SHADOWBOX ENDED.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.861
IT DID, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

06:13.900 --> 06:16.733
IT ALSO PUT SOME GUYS WITH
A PARTICULAR SET OF SKILLS

06:16.770 --> 06:18.169
ON THE FREE MARKET.

06:18.210 --> 06:21.577
AND YET THIS EXTREME
EXPRESSION OF SEXUAL BRUTALITY,

06:21.610 --> 06:23.805
THIS SEEMS TO GO FAR BEYOND
THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT

06:23.850 --> 06:25.841
DOLED OUT BY SOME
NARCOTICS GANG'S ENFORCER.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.179
YEAH, WE MAY BE LOOKING FOR
MORE OF A PURE PSYCHOPATH HERE,

06:29.220 --> 06:33.554
BUT I AGREE. THIS GUY SEEMS
PRACTICED, LIKE A PRO.

06:33.590 --> 06:35.512
WELL, EITHER WAY,
THIS UNSUB IS ORGANIZED,

06:35.560 --> 06:36.857
SKILLED, AND MOTIVATED.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.927
BUT SO ARE WE.
WHEELS UP IN 20.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.499
[SCREAMING]

06:44.530 --> 06:47.192
UHH! AAH!

06:47.240 --> 06:49.037
STOP!

06:49.070 --> 06:50.901
STOP!

06:50.940 --> 06:53.670
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:53.710 --> 06:55.905
TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

06:55.940 --> 06:57.749
I GOT MONEY.

06:57.780 --> 07:01.216
I SWEAR ON MY KIDS,
I'LL GET YOU WHAT YOU WANT, OK?

07:01.250 --> 07:03.810
[WHIRRING SOUND]

07:03.850 --> 07:06.114
NO...

07:06.150 --> 07:08.948
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?!

07:08.990 --> 07:10.753
AAH!

07:46.760 --> 07:48.159
PRENTISS: "CRUELTY,
LIKE EVERY OTHER VICE,

07:48.200 --> 07:50.691
"REQUIRES NO MOTIVE
OUTSIDE OF ITSELF.

07:50.730 --> 07:53.062
IT ONLY REQUIRES OPPORTUNITY."

07:53.100 --> 07:54.897
GEORGE ELIOT.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.931
THE VICTIMOLOGY
ON CURTIS WYLER

07:56.970 --> 07:58.198
DOES MAKE IT EASIER
TO SEE

07:58.240 --> 08:01.175
WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE
PISSED OFF A DRUG GANG.

08:01.210 --> 08:04.008
YEAH. WHILE HE WAS
A WELL-PAID CRIMINAL
DEFENSE ATTORNEY,

08:04.050 --> 08:05.802
HIS WINNING PERCENTAGE
OF CLIENTS ACCUSED

08:05.850 --> 08:07.875
OF A WIDE VARIETY
OF DRUG RELATED CRIMES WAS,

08:07.920 --> 08:09.217
UGH, NOT SO GOOD.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.911
THOUGH NONE OF THOSE
CONVICTED CLIENTS

08:10.950 --> 08:12.554
APPEAR TO HAVE
ANY OBVIOUS CONNECTION

08:12.590 --> 08:13.887
WITH THE CHALDEAN MAFIA.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.855
AND COMPARING WYLER'S
VICTIMOLOGY TO FORESTER,

08:16.890 --> 08:20.519
WELL, THERE'S A LOT MORE
CONTRAST THAN COMPARISON.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.869
WELL, DARREL FORESTER
MOVED TO DETROIT 3 YEARS AGO

08:22.900 --> 08:25.892
AND BECAME A BIG DJ
ON THE LOCAL MUSIC SCENE,

08:25.930 --> 08:28.091
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS
IS A MODEL CITIZEN.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.232
HOLD ON.

08:29.270 --> 08:31.659
I MAY HAVE FOUND
SOME CYBER SKELETONS

08:31.710 --> 08:32.972
IN THEIR CLOUD CLOSETS.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.272
CHECK OUT
THESE BANK RECORDS.

08:34.310 --> 08:37.279
OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO,
BOTH WYLER AND FORESTER

08:37.310 --> 08:40.279
HAVE MADE SOME HIGH-DOLLAR
CASH WITHDRAWALS

08:40.320 --> 08:42.072
ON A SEMI-REGULAR
WEEKLY BASIS.

08:42.120 --> 08:46.659
THEY RANGE IN AMOUNTS
FROM $5,000 TO $9,999.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.157
BECAUSE WYLER AND
FORESTER PROBABLY KNEW

08:48.190 --> 08:49.987
THAT $10,000 CASH
TRANSACTIONS

08:50.030 --> 08:51.759
AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER
THEIR BANKS TO FILE

08:51.790 --> 08:52.996
CURRENCY TRANSACTION
REPORTS

08:53.030 --> 08:54.850
ON THE FINANCIAL CRIMES
ENFORCEMENT NETWORK.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.299
SO THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT EXACTLY

08:56.330 --> 08:58.093
WERE THESE TWO MEN
PAYING FOR?

08:58.130 --> 09:00.735
MA'IT, DO YOU KNOW
AN ADRIAN SCOTT?

09:00.770 --> 09:02.829
UH, YEAH. WE WERE
ROOKIES TOGETHER. WHY?

09:02.870 --> 09:04.565
WELL, HE'S MADE
CAPTAIN NOW.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.259
HE'S ALSO OUR LOCAL
TASKFORCE LEADER.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.834
SO SINCE YOU KNOW
THE LAY OF THE LAND,

09:07.880 --> 09:09.871
I'D LIKE YOU AND REID
TO COME DOWNTOWN WITH ME.

09:09.910 --> 09:11.969
JJ, LUKE, DRIVE OUT
TO THE CRIME SCENE,

09:12.010 --> 09:14.114
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT'S BEEN OVERLOOKED.

09:14.150 --> 09:16.277
DAVE, TARA, YOU'LL GO
TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.117
HOPEFULLY BY NOW THEY'VE
BEEN ABLE TO NAIL DOWN

09:18.150 --> 09:21.756
A WINDOW FOR TIME OF DEATH,
IF NOT CAUSE OF DEATH,

09:21.790 --> 09:23.587
FOR OUR VICTIMS.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.033
SSA MATT SIMMONS.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.776
HA HA.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.107
AH, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.346
IT'S BEEN WAY TOO LONG.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.041
WISH IT WERE UNDER
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.116
THIS IS UNIT CHIEF
EMILY PRENTISS.

09:47.150 --> 09:49.243
AND DR. SPENCER REID.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.180
CAPTAIN SCOTT, THE BAU
IS HERE TO HELP YOU

09:51.220 --> 09:52.653
IN ANY WAY WE CAN.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.658
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE THIS CASE

09:54.690 --> 09:57.784
JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT
MORE TWISTED.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.890
[WHIRRING SOUND, SCREAMING]

10:04.100 --> 10:07.092
OK. STOP THAT
FOR A SECOND.

10:07.140 --> 10:11.258
MAN, OH, MAN. I THOUGHT IT WAS
ROUGH THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.278
SICK BASTARD
MADE A SNUFF FILM.

10:13.310 --> 10:15.699
AS YOU'LL SEE,
HE POSES MR. WYLER

10:15.740 --> 10:17.298
IN QUITE A FEW
DEGRADING POSITIONS.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.671
ALL THE WHILE, HE DELIBERATELY
STARTS AND STOPS THE RECORDING

10:19.720 --> 10:21.312
SO AS TO NOT APPEAR
ON CAMERA HIMSELF.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.215
SCOTT: BUT HE SAVES
THE BEST FOR LAST.

10:23.250 --> 10:26.083
AI-TER HE CASTRATES THEM,
HE JUST LETS WYLER BLEED OUT

10:26.120 --> 10:27.656
IN REAL TIME.

10:27.690 --> 10:29.988
TAPE ENDS AT 42 MINUTES
AND 15 SECONDS

10:30.030 --> 10:32.794
WHERE YOU SEE WYLER
LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS AND DIE.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.149
WAS THIS SENT
DIRECTLY TO YOU?

10:34.200 --> 10:37.226
NO.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.090
IT WAS SENT LIKE THIS.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.805
CLEAN. NO FINGERPRINTS,
NO DNA.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.808
ALL ON THE LITTLE
MICRO-CASSETTE

10:44.840 --> 10:46.364
THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN
IN LIKE 20 YEARS.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.731
THERE WERE TWO TAPES,
ACTUALLY,

10:48.780 --> 10:50.805
BOTH HAND-DELIVERED,
ONE TO WYLER'S HOME,

10:50.850 --> 10:52.203
THE OTHER
TO FORESTER'S CONDO.

10:52.250 --> 10:53.877
AND MRS. WYLER
GAVE YOU THIS ONE?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.842
THANK GOD
SHE COULDN'T PLAY IT.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.711
IT LOOKS LIKE PURE
SEXUAL SADISM,

10:57.750 --> 10:59.047
BUT IN THIS CASE,
THE UNSUB

10:59.090 --> 11:01.081
NOT ONLY INFLICTED
PHYSICAL PAIN ON THE VICTIM,

11:01.120 --> 11:02.724
BUT HE INTENDED TO EXACT
A SECONDARY

11:02.760 --> 11:04.125
PSYCHOLOGICAL SADISM
ON OTHERS

11:04.160 --> 11:05.286
BY SENDING THEM THE TAPE.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.285
EXCEPT WHY WOULD
HE USE MEDIA

11:06.330 --> 11:07.695
THAT NOBODY
HAS ANYMORE?

11:07.730 --> 11:08.856
IT COULD SUGGEST
SOME SORT OF DEGREE

11:08.900 --> 11:10.390
OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE
OR MAYBE EVEN

11:10.430 --> 11:12.193
A COMPLETE LACK THEREOF.
IT IS, HOWEVER,

11:12.230 --> 11:13.868
AN EFFECTIVE FORENSIC
COUNTERMEASURE

11:13.900 --> 11:15.959
IN THAT IT AVOIDS
THE TECHNICAL MARKINGS

11:16.000 --> 11:17.262
INHERENT TO DIGITAL MEDIA.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.868
WE SHOULD TALK
TO MRS. WYLER.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.969
ABSOLUTELY. SHE'S HERE.

11:21.010 --> 11:23.399
SHE INSISTED ON WAITING
IN MY OFFICE.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.769
SPENCE, I'D LIKE YOU
TO STAY HERE

11:24.810 --> 11:26.300
WITH OFFICER ROYCE.
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT

11:26.350 --> 11:28.341
WHAT THAT BUILDING IS
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

11:28.380 --> 11:30.109
WHERE IT IS.

11:33.190 --> 11:36.751
MRS. WYLER, DO YOU HAPPEN
TO RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

11:36.790 --> 11:38.724
NO. SHOULD I?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.796
HIS NAME IS DARREL FORESTER.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.491
HE WASN'T A CLIENT
OF YOUR HUSBAND'S.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.896
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU KNEW HIM SOCIALLY.

11:44.930 --> 11:46.966
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.161
AT LEAST HE NEVER
MENTIONED HIM TO ME.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.361
WOULD YOU TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE BANK RECORDS?

11:51.410 --> 11:54.231
I'VE HIGHLIGHTED A SERIES
OF CASH WITHDRAWALS

11:54.280 --> 11:56.430
YOUR HUSBAND MADE
OVER THE PAST YEAR.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.209
DO YOU KNOW
WHY HE WOULD MAKE

11:58.250 --> 12:01.219
THOSE PARTICULAR
TRANSACTIONS?

12:01.250 --> 12:03.286
[CLEARS THROAT]

12:03.320 --> 12:06.187
CURTIS HANDLED
ALL OF OUR FINANCES.

12:06.220 --> 12:09.929
SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THESE?

12:09.960 --> 12:12.053
WHY SHOULD I?

12:12.090 --> 12:14.058
I'M SORRY. ALL--

12:14.100 --> 12:15.419
MAY I USE
THE LADIES' ROOM?

12:15.460 --> 12:16.449
YES, OF COURSE.
IT'S DOWN THE HALL

12:16.500 --> 12:18.161
ON THE LEI-T.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.361
YOU THINK SHE SUSPECTED
HER HUSBAND HAD
SOMEBODY ON THE SIDE?

12:25.410 --> 12:28.504
I THINK SHE MADE
A CONSCIOUS DECISION
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.249
BUT GIVEN THE AMOUNTS
AND FREQUENCY OF WITHDRAWALS,

12:32.280 --> 12:34.817
I'M NOT SO SURE
WE'RE LOOKING AT
AN ONGOING AFFAIR HERE

12:34.850 --> 12:37.944
SO MUCH OF SOME SORT OF
PAY-TO-PLAY.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.356
MM. AN ONLINE ESCORT
SERVICE COULD DEFINITELY

12:40.390 --> 12:43.086
BE THE WAY THE UNSUB
FOUND BOTH WYLER
AND FORESTER.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.529
[RING]

12:44.560 --> 12:45.527
HAIL TO MY CHIEF.
WHAT'S UP?

12:45.560 --> 12:46.959
GARCIA, GET READY
ON YOUR END.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.955
WE'RE GOING TO BE
SENDING YOU LINKS

12:48.000 --> 12:49.126
TO PERSONAL COMPUTERS.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.094
WE SUSPECT BOTH
WYLER AND FORESTER

12:51.130 --> 12:53.530
WERE KEEPING THEIR
APPETITE FOR PROSTITUTES
ON THE DOWN LOW.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.993
OH, THAT IS
A DEBAUCHEROUS DIET.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.302
OK, YOU SEND ME
WHAT YOU HAVE

12:57.340 --> 12:58.364
AND I WILL DECIPHER
HOW THESE DUDES

12:58.410 --> 13:00.469
ARRANGED THEIR NAUGHTY DATES.

13:01.840 --> 13:03.842
SO YOU WALK THROUGH
THESE CRIME SCENES

13:03.880 --> 13:06.371
AND YOU REALIZE
THE UNSUB NEEDS TIME

13:06.410 --> 13:09.243
TO SET THIS CRAZY STAGE.
SO HE'S OBVIOUSLY

13:09.280 --> 13:10.838
COMFORTABLE
IN TH ESE SPACES.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.539
ALVEZ: IT'S DIFFICULT
TO IMAGINE THAT THESE TWO MEN

13:12.590 --> 13:14.251
ARE HIS FIRST KILLS.
I MEAN, THERE'S DEFINITELY

13:14.290 --> 13:17.487
A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE
AND EXPERTISE BEING
DEMONSTRATED.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.521
AND YET WE FOUND
NOTHING IN VICAP.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.959
YEAH, WE SHOULD DO
A GEO PROFILE

13:21.000 --> 13:23.264
OF POTENTIAL DUMP SITES
IN THE AREA.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.597
GARCIA, WHAT DID YOU FIND?

13:24.630 --> 13:27.098
I COME BEARING
A CURIOUS LOVE CONNECTION

13:27.140 --> 13:28.266
BETWEEN OUR TWO VICTIMS,

13:28.300 --> 13:30.439
AND SHE CALLS HERSELF DASHA.

13:30.470 --> 13:32.267
FOLLOWING ALONG
IN YOUR HYMNALS,

13:32.310 --> 13:34.505
YOU'LL SEE THAT BOTH WYLER
AND FORESTER

13:34.540 --> 13:36.508
WERE QUITE SMITTEN
WITH THIS COMELY LASS,

13:36.540 --> 13:40.146
SO MUCH SO THAT THEY ARCHIVED
THEIR VERY ROMANTIC EMAILS,

13:40.180 --> 13:42.512
AND THEREFORE,
I WAS ABLE TO USE THOSE

13:42.550 --> 13:45.110
TO TRACE EACH GENTLEMAN'S
"MEET CUTE"

13:45.150 --> 13:47.015
WITH DASHA TO THE WEBSITE

13:47.060 --> 13:49.449
OF THE BLUE SIREN
INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL CLUB,

13:49.490 --> 13:52.425

ENCOURAGED TO CULTIVATE

13:52.460 --> 13:56.157

AND SATISFYING
SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.

WHERE SUGAR DADDIES
MEET SUGAR BABIES.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.897
HOOKERS AND JOHNS
BY ANY OTHER NAME.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.430
IT LOOKS AS IF BLUE SIREN

14:02.470 --> 14:05.109
WORKS ALMOST LIKE PRETTY MUCH
EVERY DATING SITE.

14:05.140 --> 14:08.439

AND THEN HOOK UP
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.904
YEAH, BUT THEY DON'T
LIKE TO ENROLL USING
THEIR REAL NAMES.

14:11.950 --> 14:13.042
I MEAN, DASHA?

14:13.080 --> 14:14.570
CLEARLY THAT IS
A NOM DE PLUME,

14:14.620 --> 14:16.440
BUT HER REAL NAME
IS IN THE VEILED HANDS
OF THE BLUE SIREN.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.914
STRANGE, THOUGH.
OUR PROFILE BEGINS

14:18.950 --> 14:22.078
WITH A MALE SEXUAL SADIST
HUNTING VICTIMS

14:22.120 --> 14:24.918
THROUGH ESCORT SERVICES.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.394
EXCEPT WHEN YOU READ
THESE EMAILS, I MEAN,

14:27.430 --> 14:29.591
YOU KNOW THAT THESE GUYS
MET AND HUNG OUT

14:29.630 --> 14:31.393
WITH THE ONE
THEY WERE EXPECTING.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.194
UH, TRUE, AND I KNOW
WE DON'T HAVE
A RELIABLE TIMELINE

14:34.240 --> 14:35.298
FOR EITHER OF THESE CRIMES,

14:35.340 --> 14:37.069
BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL,

14:37.110 --> 14:38.463
DASHA WAS THE LAST PERSON

14:38.510 --> 14:40.102
TO SEE BOTH OF
THESE MEN ALIVE.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.344
GARCIA, TELL ME YOU HAVE
A TERRESTRIAL ADDRESS

14:43.380 --> 14:44.677

15:10.510 --> 15:15.334
IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT OF TIME.

INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.413
BUT BEFORE I GET
TOO DISTRACT ED,

AT THE RIGHT PLACE?

16:27.250 --> 16:29.639
WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING
TO TALK TO YOUR ATTORNEY.

THAT WE'RE NOT HERE

THOUGHT AT FIRST,

30:47.310 --> 30:48.470
FROM THE CARGO
CONTAINER SITE.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.171
HER NAME
IS CYNTHIA HENDRICKS.

30:50.210 --> 30:52.576
SHE'S BEEN LISTED
AS A MISSING PERSON
IN INDIANA

30:52.610 --> 30:55.340
SINCE JULY OF 1996.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.540
HERE'S SOMETHING.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.639
CYNTHIA HAD A LITTLE GIRL.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.079
SHE HAD A BABY.
HER NAME WAS KIMBERLY.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.624
SHE HAD THAT BABY
ON MAY 6, 1994.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.356
THAT'S KIMBERLY
DESMOND'S BIRTHDAY.

31:07.390 --> 31:09.551
EXACTLY. AND THEN I THOUGHT
MAYBE THAT'S A COIN KYDINK,

31:09.600 --> 31:10.999
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
WHAT TARA SAID

31:11.030 --> 31:12.258
ABOUT A HOME BIRTH
AND I FOLLOWED UP ON THAT.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.188
EXCEPT IN INDIANA,
AND THIS KIMBERLY

31:14.240 --> 31:17.368
WAS BORN AT HOME,
SO THEY HAD TO FILL OUT A FORM

31:17.400 --> 31:19.106
AND HAVE IT NOTARIZED
AND SIGNED BY WITNESSES.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.132
ONE OF THE WITNESSES
WAS A JANEL MERZA,

31:22.180 --> 31:24.501
THE SISTER OF THE FATHER
OF KIMBERLY.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.474
HIS NAME, GABRIEL MERZA.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.546
IT SAYS HERE HE WAS GRANTED
PAROLE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR

31:29.580 --> 31:31.116
FROM SIDNEY FALLS
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY,

31:31.150 --> 31:32.583
HAVING SERVED 10
OF HIS 15 YEARS

31:32.620 --> 31:34.156
FOR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.

31:34.190 --> 31:36.385
THAT WAS JUST ONE
OF HIS MANY CRIMES,

31:36.420 --> 31:37.978
WHICH INCLUDE
PUTTING A BULLET

31:38.030 --> 31:39.520
IN THE BACK OF HIS
BABY MAMA'S HEAD.

31:39.560 --> 31:40.925
SHE WAS PROBABLY
ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM,

31:40.960 --> 31:42.222
MAYBE EVEN
GO TO THE POLICE.

31:42.260 --> 31:44.399
AND YET, WITH WHATEVER
SLIVER OF HUMANITY

31:44.430 --> 31:46.068

IN HIM,

31:46.100 --> 31:48.534

TO SPARE THE LIFE
OF HIS BABY GIRL

31:48.570 --> 31:50.663
AND GIVE HER UP
TO HIS SISTER TO RAISE.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.236

SO AFRAID OF HER BROTHER

31:52.270 --> 31:53.703
THAT SHE WASN'T LYING
TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY,

31:53.740 --> 31:56.129
SHE'S BEEN LYING
TO PROTECT KIMBERLY
FROM THE AWFUL TRUTH.

31:56.180 --> 31:57.670

HE GOT OUT OF PRISON,

31:57.710 --> 31:59.246

ONE PART OF HIS LIFE

31:59.280 --> 32:00.577

HIS DAUGHTER HAD GROWN UP
