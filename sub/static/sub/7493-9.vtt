WEBVTT

00:12.250 --> 00:13.917
Oh!

00:19.458 --> 00:21.625
Man, he's really struggling
with that thing.

00:21.709 --> 00:22.750
Looks pretty heavy.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.458
I can't sit here and watch this.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.709
I'm gonna go give him some help.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.375
Lift with your legs!

00:32.625 --> 00:34.917
Aww, you're a good friend.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.250
That's what I do.

00:36.875 --> 00:38.041
Yo, so what's in the trunk?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.542
I'll give you a hint.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.917
You wouldn't be standing
here today without it.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.542
You locked my mother in the trunk!

00:46.500 --> 00:47.959
Okay, okay, okay.

00:48.291 --> 00:50.083
Your mother's not in the trunk.

00:51.583 --> 00:52.583
Hey, dude, um,

00:52.667 --> 00:54.667
what are you doing
with a bunch of old clothes?

00:54.750 --> 00:57.083
These are artifacts from
the Battle of Seaford Hill.

00:57.166 --> 00:59.959
The President of the Historical Society
hand-selected me

01:00.041 --> 01:01.667
to be the director of the reenactment.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.667
Wait, aren't you the president?

01:03.750 --> 01:04.959
I said "hand-selected."

01:05.542 --> 01:07.625
Dude, I hate when they do the reenactment.

01:07.709 --> 01:10.625
It reminds everyone
I'm related to Cook Martinez, the traitor.

01:10.709 --> 01:13.417
Oh, come on, Jerry,
that was 200 years ago.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.166
I'm sure nobody remembers
that Cook Martinez got all the troops sick

01:16.250 --> 01:17.625
and almost cost Seaford the battle.

01:17.709 --> 01:18.875
Watch this.

01:22.417 --> 01:23.750
<i>Boo!</i>

01:28.792 --> 01:30.625
Yeah, I'm gonna say they still remember.

01:34.417 --> 01:36.375
Anyone want an egg? Got one left.

01:39.709 --> 01:41.000
For the reenactment tomorrow,

01:41.083 --> 01:43.959
I got Bobby Wasabi to play
the French general, LaPew.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.000
Now I just need someone
to play General Douglas.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.834
Oh, oh, oh.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.750
Pick me! Pick me!

01:51.834 --> 01:53.750
You guys know I'm 1/64th Douglas, right?

01:54.458 --> 01:56.625
Yes, you keep telling us.

01:57.417 --> 01:58.667
Come on, Milton.

01:59.750 --> 02:00.792
Look at me.

02:00.875 --> 02:03.041
I would make the perfect General Douglas.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.750
A lot of people say
I have very similar qualities to him,

02:05.875 --> 02:07.959
like courage, vision

02:08.041 --> 02:09.500
and a quiet understated grace.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.500
Yeah, he was also known
for his chronic battle

02:11.583 --> 02:12.917
- with lice.
-

02:13.792 --> 02:16.458
Uh, do you see any?
Pick 'em out! Pick 'em out!

02:16.542 --> 02:19.291
Rudy, relax. It's a 200-year-old wig.

02:19.375 --> 02:21.250
If there were any lice,
I'm sure they're all dead.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.875
Heh, maybe not all of them.

02:30.709 --> 02:33.083
Look, Milton, I really wanna play
General Douglas.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.709
I'll give you anything you want.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.333
I want to be sensei.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.250
Milton, relax.
Rudy's not gonna make you sen--

02:38.333 --> 02:39.333
Aah!

02:41.333 --> 02:42.458
Bow to your new sensei.

02:42.542 --> 02:44.417
- No!
- General Douglas says bow!

02:44.500 --> 02:45.792
Okay.

02:48.375 --> 02:51.667
<i>♪ Don't you get all tough with me ♪</i>

03:30.375 --> 03:33.625
My play is an accurate portrayal
of the way the battle was won.

03:33.709 --> 03:35.583
Now, I've gone to great
detail to make sure

03:35.667 --> 03:37.583
everything is 100% authentic.

03:40.875 --> 03:44.000
Excuse me, soldier,
why is your shirt pink?

03:44.083 --> 03:46.709
Just because I'm a soldier,
Doesn't mean I can't have flare.

03:46.792 --> 03:49.625
No soldier ever fought
in a shirt that color.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.041
Well, I think it makes
the soldier's eyes pop.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.583
- Yep, it really does.
-

03:53.667 --> 03:54.959
- Thank you.
- Wha--

03:55.792 --> 03:58.625
Look, Milton, as a movie star,

03:58.709 --> 04:01.166
I have a vision for my character LaPew.

04:02.291 --> 04:05.166
I'm going to storm in,
declare victory in front of the whole town

04:05.291 --> 04:08.709
and then ride off on a white horse
with a beautiful maiden.

04:08.792 --> 04:10.083
That's not what happened.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.500
You surrendered in a blubbering
heap of embarrassment.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.709
Oh, well, I'll cancel the horse,

04:15.792 --> 04:17.250
but I'm keeping the maiden.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.083
All right, Rudy, let's rehearse
General Sherman's entrance.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.917
And... Action.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.959
Oh, good people of Seaford.

04:29.041 --> 04:32.542
It is I, your humble,
yet bemedaled leader,

04:32.625 --> 04:34.041
Sherman Douglas.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.542
Rudy, where'd you get all those medals?

04:36.625 --> 04:39.417
Oh, this one's for skee ball

04:39.500 --> 04:40.875
and this one's for selling cookies.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.500
Whoa, and this one's
from Chad's Steakhouse

04:43.583 --> 04:45.041
for eating a 40-ounce rump roast.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.542
All right.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.542
Where's the actual jacket

04:48.625 --> 04:50.750
that was worn by Douglas?
It was in the trunk.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.542
I left that old thing at the dojo.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.375
Now, if anyone needs me,

04:54.500 --> 04:56.208
I will be in my dressing room.

05:03.542 --> 05:06.291
You would not believe what Bobby's doing
in my dressing room.

05:08.458 --> 05:10.083
It's my dressing room now.

05:16.458 --> 05:18.667
<i>Boo!</i>

05:22.333 --> 05:26.500
You kids got to get up pretty early
if you want to egg Jerry Martinez.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.250
You got up pretty early, didn't you, kid?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.834
It was worth it.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.333
That's it.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.959
Ugh! Stupid General Sherman's coat.

06:02.709 --> 06:04.166
This is all your fault.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.333
Ugh!

06:07.125 --> 06:08.166
Oh, that's it!

06:13.750 --> 06:14.959
Huh?

06:18.375 --> 06:20.667
"Property of Cook Martinez"?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.667
Wow, that thing was really clogged.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.959
And as the clock struck four bells,

06:32.041 --> 06:34.458
General LaPew surrendered
to General Douglas,

06:34.542 --> 06:36.125
who sealed it with his glove.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.041
And General LaPew sealed it right back!

06:47.458 --> 06:50.417
Not feeling that the surrender
was sealed entirely,

06:50.500 --> 06:52.000
Sherman sealed it again!

06:55.417 --> 06:59.125
Feeling a glove
was no longer sufficient to seal it,

06:59.208 --> 07:01.625
General LaPew grabbed a nearby musket!

07:01.709 --> 07:03.792
I think we're all sealed up, thank you.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.458
And it was that treaty which ensured

07:08.542 --> 07:11.166
that General Douglas
would go down in history.

07:15.583 --> 07:17.834
And that is why today we honor--

07:17.917 --> 07:20.125
The biggest liar is Seaford's history!

07:22.041 --> 07:23.542
Bobby, pass me the musket.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.583
Jerry, what are you talking about?

07:25.667 --> 07:26.959
This.

07:27.959 --> 07:31.000
This diary holds Cook Martinez's secret.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.208
The secret should be that
the dude wrote in a diary.

07:34.291 --> 07:35.583
Am I right?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.083
Here's what really happened
at the battle of Seaford.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.041
"The year is 1814."

07:47.458 --> 07:50.542
<i>We've been at war for 13 months
and our supplies are running out.</i>

07:50.625 --> 07:53.500
<i>in order to keep the soldiers fed,
I had to get creative in the kitchen.</i>

07:56.625 --> 07:57.750
Cook Martinez.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.458
The men are complaining about the stew.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.000
They say it tastes like an old boot.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.375
Why would they say that?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.041
'Cause I made it out of an old boot.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.333
Well, the pea soup isn't bad.

08:09.417 --> 08:10.959
Oh, great, I'll go make some more.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.500
Uh, I wouldn't eat that.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.750
- Why not?
- We never had any peas.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.709
This just isn't right.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.125
What little supplies we have left,

08:22.208 --> 08:24.208
the General is keeping for himself.

08:24.291 --> 08:26.709
It's because he's a mean, selfish leader

08:26.792 --> 08:28.083
who doesn't care about his men.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.625
What did you say, soldier?

08:31.458 --> 08:33.583
Uh, I said we should bring clean shellfish

08:33.667 --> 08:35.583
to the leader who does
his hair for his men.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.583
You got that right.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.583
I'm a four-star general
rocking a five-star coif.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.709
Sir, the men haven't eaten in three days.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.542
And we're about to go
into battle against LaPew.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.000
You think I don't know that?

08:50.083 --> 08:51.709
That's why I bought this meat.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.000
Sir, the men aren't gonna eat this.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.041
Why not? The flies seem to love it.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.291
No, check that.
Some of them seem to be sick.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.959
In fact, they're dropping like--
Well, you know...

09:09.417 --> 09:10.291
flies.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.500
Yo, I'm not sure this meat is even dead.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.875
I can't believe we have
To serve this slop to our men.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.083
Our goat wouldn't eat this.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.625
I know, I tried giving it to her

09:38.709 --> 09:40.166
And she pulled a rifle on me.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.417
Uh, why aren't we eating the goat?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.750
I just told you.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.125
She pulled a rifle on me.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.500
Hey, the men don't look good.

09:56.041 --> 09:59.375
Oh, come on, they may not be
the most handsome bunch,

09:59.458 --> 10:02.834
but if I were a lonely frontier woman,
I could find a husband here.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.750
For instance, look at Davis over there.

10:06.834 --> 10:08.333
In the right light, his cheekbones--

10:08.417 --> 10:10.667
No, no, no. The soldiers look sick.

10:10.792 --> 10:11.792
They're turning blue.

10:13.125 --> 10:16.375
Men, LaPew's army is advancing.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.959
But rest assured as you're
out there facing certain death,

10:21.041 --> 10:23.000
I will be right beside

10:23.083 --> 10:24.917
my toasty fire...

10:26.917 --> 10:28.834
Where I will be writing
a letter of condolence

10:28.917 --> 10:31.625
to officer Nate's hot wife, Annabelle.

10:31.917 --> 10:32.917
Nate's not dead.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.542
You just sent him on a scouting mission.

10:37.834 --> 10:39.417
Good news from the front.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.834
The enemy has surrendered, sir?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.417
No, Nate's been captured.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.291
General, these men are sick.

10:45.417 --> 10:47.750
You don't have an army
and the enemy are about to attack.

10:47.834 --> 10:48.667
You need a plan.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.041
You don't think I have a plan?

10:50.125 --> 10:52.625
Oh, I have a plan.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.959
Have the pony express come pick me up.

11:02.542 --> 11:04.417
-
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

11:04.500 --> 11:06.750
<i>Who are you? How did you get in my trunk?</i>

11:06.834 --> 11:08.250
<i>And do you know "Camptown Races"?</i>

11:13.667 --> 11:17.208
Guys, we're the only ones
who didn't eat the meat.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.083
It's up to us to save Seaford.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.375
We're just cooks.

11:21.458 --> 11:23.583
We don't know anything
about being soldiers

11:23.709 --> 11:25.834
or winning battles, or firing rifles.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.667
<i>-</i>

11:29.917 --> 11:32.125
If that goat can figure it out, so can we.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.208
Yo, where'd you get the mustache?

11:51.834 --> 11:53.000
Oh, man, I don't know.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.041
Once I started ripping things off,
I couldn't stop.

11:57.041 --> 11:58.542
Okay, we got into the enemy camp,

11:58.625 --> 12:00.792
but are you sure your plan
to defeat them is gonna work?

12:00.875 --> 12:02.417
I know the plan's gonna work, okay?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.959
If this meat wiped out our army.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.291
It'll wipe out theirs.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.500
Oh, here comes General LaPew.

12:07.583 --> 12:08.959
Quick, act French.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.792
- Oh, ho, ho!
- <i>Oui, oui!</i>

12:11.875 --> 12:13.417
- Oh, ho, <i>bonjour.</i>
- <i>Vive la France!</i>

12:13.500 --> 12:15.291
- Oh, <i>oui, oui.</i>
- <i>Fromage.</i>

12:18.500 --> 12:21.500
Tonight, I will claim Seaford for France.

12:24.041 --> 12:27.625
I will show the world
that my army cannot be stopped!

12:29.500 --> 12:31.166
And once they are defeated,

12:31.208 --> 12:33.333
I will sunbathe on their golden beaches

12:33.375 --> 12:36.291
in my teeny, weenie victory bikini!

12:38.542 --> 12:39.792
- What?
-

12:40.417 --> 12:43.250
Okay, so maybe I'm a little pasty,
but, I mean, come on, guys!

12:44.500 --> 12:46.792
They're not puking
'cause they're thinking of you sunbathing.

12:46.875 --> 12:50.000
I was.

12:51.959 --> 12:54.041
I tricked your men into eating bad meat.

12:55.709 --> 12:56.959
Ah!

12:57.041 --> 12:59.542
You are Americans!

13:00.333 --> 13:03.375
But when you were,
<i>"bonjour, oui, oui, vive la France,"</i>

13:03.458 --> 13:05.208
I totally believed you.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.792
You got no army left, LaPew.

13:07.875 --> 13:08.959
Surrender.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.667
You are forgetting about
my elite group of soldiers

13:13.750 --> 13:15.667
who did not eat your meat.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.375
Prepare to battle

13:17.417 --> 13:19.709
the <i>vegetariens.</i>

13:20.667 --> 13:21.625
What?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.041
The <i>vege-tariens!</i>

13:27.959 --> 13:29.125
I'm sorry, one more time.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.875
They don't eat meat.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.417
Oh, you mean vegetarians.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.834
- You could have just said that.
- Ah!

13:33.917 --> 13:35.000
I so said that.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.792
oh.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.750
Your cookware

13:40.834 --> 13:43.083
is no match for our...

13:43.166 --> 13:45.041
Powerful muskets.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.083
But first, we have to load them,

13:47.166 --> 13:48.625
so quick time-out!

13:50.709 --> 13:53.166
<i>♪ La-da-dee, la-da-daa ♪</i>

13:53.250 --> 13:55.750
So, how 'bout this weather
we're having, no?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.667
It really is nice.
The days are just delightful.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.250
And at night, you only
need a light jacket.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.083
Oh, yeah, so nice.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.834
<i>Yeah.</i>
- What are we gonna do?

14:03.917 --> 14:05.000
They just called time-out.

14:05.667 --> 14:06.625
I got this.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.542
Time in!

14:10.917 --> 14:12.959
I did not see that coming.

14:14.917 --> 14:16.417
Aah!

14:22.500 --> 14:24.208
- Aah!
-

14:46.542 --> 14:47.959
Aah!

14:49.291 --> 14:50.959
Oh! Oh!

15:18.625 --> 15:20.917
That's it, LaPew. It's over.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.083
It's time to surrender.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.208
I will never surrender.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.750
My men and I will fight--

15:27.875 --> 15:29.041
Okay, I surrender.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.166
You did it. Your plan worked.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.458
- We won.
- That's it.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.125
- Wh-- Oh.
- It's over.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.542
Something's coming over me.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.625
This victory's gotten me so excited,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.583
I think-- I think I want to make a noise.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.000
Whoo!

15:47.083 --> 15:48.542
What was that?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.208
I'll tell you what that was.

15:51.291 --> 15:53.667
That was the sound of victory.

15:54.375 --> 15:55.875
It was the sound of liberty.

15:55.959 --> 15:59.041
That was the "whoo"
heard 'round the world.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.917
<i>Whoo!</i>

16:02.834 --> 16:05.834
<i>Crikey, who's "whooing" at this hour?</i>

16:08.542 --> 16:11.834
<i>Mamma mia, that's a big "whoo."</i>

16:14.375 --> 16:17.667
<i>I think I just heard a "whoo"
come from Earth.</i>

16:17.750 --> 16:19.041
<i>Let's not destroy it.</i>

16:26.166 --> 16:28.000
<i>LaPew? If that's you,</i>

16:28.083 --> 16:30.583
<i>I just want you to know I'm really French.</i>

16:32.250 --> 16:33.375
<i>I swear.</i>

16:33.458 --> 16:36.875
<i>I am just sitting here wearing my beret,</i>

16:36.959 --> 16:39.458
<i>sharing a crepe with my French poodle.</i>

16:39.542 --> 16:41.834
-
<i>Down, Fifi!</i>

16:43.542 --> 16:44.792
General, we did it.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.125
We defeated the enemy.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.875
What?

16:47.959 --> 16:49.875
- Yeah.
- We got a letter of surrender.

16:50.917 --> 16:52.667
We got their troops sick
with the bad meat.

16:52.750 --> 16:54.583
I wrote everything down
in my secret diary.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.250
Uh, the secret should be
that you're a dude with a diary.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.542
Am I right?

17:03.667 --> 17:07.208
So no one has seen
this diary or this letter?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.709
- Negative.
- Good.

17:09.291 --> 17:11.667
This surrender will mean a medal of valor,

17:11.750 --> 17:13.917
<i>a badge of honor and a red sash.</i>

17:14.000 --> 17:15.333
And do you know what follows that?

17:15.417 --> 17:16.417
Sash bash!

17:16.500 --> 17:19.917
Oh! I love putting on a sash
and dancing the night away.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.875
But not for you. For me.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.667
Arrest these traitors!

17:25.750 --> 17:27.375
- Wait, what?
- What are you talking about?

17:27.458 --> 17:30.208
- But we're heroes.
- No one will ever know that but me.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.625
Because without this,

17:31.709 --> 17:34.709
everyone will believe
that I single-handedly won the war.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.667
- Take them away.
- Are you kidding me?

17:36.750 --> 17:37.959
- Why would you?
- What?

17:41.583 --> 17:42.709
Nate?

17:44.291 --> 17:46.083
Thank goodness you've escaped.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.375
I'm sure your hot wife Annabelle
can't wait to see you.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.208
Guards, we have another traitor!

17:59.583 --> 18:02.166
Wow, so history got it wrong.

18:02.834 --> 18:05.166
General LaPew was the real hero.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.417
That's not what I said at all.

18:09.500 --> 18:12.291
Oh. Well, to be honest,
I missed most of your story.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.500
So Cook Martinez and his men
were the real heroes?

18:16.125 --> 18:17.166
That's right.

18:17.250 --> 18:20.583
And General Douglas had them jailed
so he could steal their glory.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.166
boo!

18:24.792 --> 18:28.208
What? I'm like 1/64th related to the dude.

18:28.291 --> 18:32.125
I mean, Milton's probably
more related to Douglas than I am.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.041
Let's get him!

18:33.125 --> 18:33.959
Rudy!

18:35.000 --> 18:37.583
As president of the historical society,

18:37.667 --> 18:38.792
I would like the record to show

18:38.875 --> 18:40.667
that we recognize General Douglas

18:40.750 --> 18:42.208
for what he was,

18:42.291 --> 18:44.542
- a traitor...
-

18:44.625 --> 18:46.542
- a coward...
-

18:46.625 --> 18:49.125
- and a liar.
- Uh, no, no, no.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.458
I may be related to
a traitor and a coward,

18:51.542 --> 18:52.750
but I earned that medal.

18:52.834 --> 18:53.834
You know how?

18:53.917 --> 18:55.250
By eating a 40-ounce rump.

18:56.542 --> 18:59.166
So, Milton, what are we gonna do
to honor Cook Martinez?

19:00.083 --> 19:01.291
I think I have an idea.

19:02.291 --> 19:03.875
From this day forward,

19:03.959 --> 19:05.583
let the good people of Seaford know

19:05.667 --> 19:08.333
that Cook Martinez
was the real hero of our town.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.208
It's beautiful, Milton.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.542
Your family deserves this.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.667
It's long overdue.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.709
And on behalf of the entire town,

19:21.792 --> 19:23.125
Thanks for making this chili.

19:24.959 --> 19:26.208
Oh, yeah, it was fun.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.959
I just followed one of the recipes
that I found in my ancestor's diary.

19:29.041 --> 19:29.959
Oh.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.166
Dude, this chili is great.
What's your secret?

19:32.250 --> 19:34.250
Oh, I mixed in that leftover
bag of beef jerky

19:34.291 --> 19:36.542
- I found at the dojo.
- What?

19:36.625 --> 19:39.417
I found that bag of gnarly meat
at the bottom of that trunk.

19:41.000 --> 19:45.083
Dude, you just fed the entire town
200-year-old rancid meat.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.291
- What?
- Uh...

19:47.375 --> 19:48.750
Everybody, calm down.

19:48.834 --> 19:50.333
If there was anything
wrong with that meat,

19:50.417 --> 19:52.083
- we'd all be very si--
-

19:53.792 --> 19:55.625
I got the first port-a-potty!

19:55.709 --> 19:57.458
I got the second port-a-potty!

20:01.750 --> 20:03.792
Lucky for me, I only had one bite.

20:04.709 --> 20:06.542
I think I'll be okay as long as I stand

20:06.625 --> 20:08.458
- Very, very still.
-

20:09.417 --> 20:12.125
Oh! Sweet mother Moses, help me!

20:12.959 --> 20:14.583
I'm running for the river!

20:28.083 --> 20:29.625
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

20:34.583 --> 20:37.792
Annabelle, sweet Annabelle,

20:37.875 --> 20:41.000
it burdens me to tell you
that your beloved husband Nate is gone.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.750
The last we saw,
he was taken by a large grizzly bear.

20:46.417 --> 20:49.083
And as the general, it falls
upon me to comfort you.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.834
This is the part of the job that I hate.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.041
Nate?

20:58.583 --> 20:59.917
Uh...

21:01.083 --> 21:02.291
Thank goodness you survived

21:02.375 --> 21:06.709
the "being wrapped in rabbit meat
and thrown in a bear cave" mission.

21:08.917 --> 21:10.792
You have earned the medal of valor.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.333
It's waiting for you in my tent.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.500
<i>-</i>

21:23.750 --> 21:25.709
Now, where were we, Annabelle?

21:56.875 --> 21:57.750
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.583 --> 22:02.458
<i>Yes!</i>
