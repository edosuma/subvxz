01:46.160 --> 01:48.800
Shit!

02:14.120 --> 02:16.080
Bingo.

04:26.884 --> 04:28.095
Damn!

06:23.120 --> 06:25.120
Fire!

06:54.616 --> 06:56.368
Incoming!

06:58.245 --> 06:59.996
Hit the deck!

07:06.258 --> 07:07.178
Yes!

07:14.343 --> 07:15.220
Yeah!

07:31.193 --> 07:33.779
I don't think so.

07:34.489 --> 07:38.283
- Good work, Agent Marcus.
- Thank you.

07:38.367 --> 07:42.204
Great shooting, Mahoney.
Now clean up all that shit, huh?

08:17.824 --> 08:19.950
ID, please.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.552
All right, sir.

09:16.881 --> 09:19.681
Name - Voorhees, Jason.

09:19.765 --> 09:23.553
This case is eyes only. This tape
is strictly for internal distribution.

09:23.637 --> 09:25.888
Anyone listening needs
C-4 clearance or higher.

09:25.972 --> 09:29.268
If not - you're in a heap of trouble!

09:52.917 --> 09:55.002
Ooh...

09:56.209 --> 09:57.248
Jesus!

10:09.116 --> 10:12.185
We have a large male Caucasian...

10:12.269 --> 10:17.316
..with massive tissue loss
due to extreme explosive trauma.

10:17.400 --> 10:22.237
Weight - I'd say 230, maybe... 240.

10:22.321 --> 10:28.284
And third-degree burns
over 65% of the anterior torso.

10:28.368 --> 10:33.541
First and second
over... the posterior torso.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.770
In addition to explosive trauma,...

10:56.187 --> 10:59.232
..the subject is a victim of...

10:59.317 --> 11:01.693
..multiple...

11:01.777 --> 11:03.653
..bullet wounds.

11:08.816 --> 11:10.734
At a glance, I'd say...

11:10.827 --> 11:13.080
..we're looking at well over...

11:13.955 --> 11:16.667
..a hundred bullet wounds of...

11:18.753 --> 11:21.338
..varying calibre.

11:24.591 --> 11:27.260
This is gonna be a real joy to count.

11:46.614 --> 11:48.990
Now,...

11:51.035 --> 11:54.371
..in my professional opinion,...

11:54.830 --> 11:57.624
..this guy's deader than shit!

11:58.686 --> 12:02.003
Hee!

12:02.088 --> 12:04.422
Strike that last comment from the record.

12:40.333 --> 12:45.214
Evidence upon examination,
indicates severe pulmonary oedema.

12:48.133 --> 12:52.672
I'd say the heart appears to be
twice the size of a normal heart.

12:52.756 --> 12:55.807
It's malformed.

12:56.809 --> 13:00.395
Fatty deposits - left, right atria.

13:08.696 --> 13:13.993
The heart appears to be filled
with a black, viscous fluid.

13:17.037 --> 13:21.041
Frankly, I don't know what the hell it is.
It's not blood.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.491
ID!

15:18.575 --> 15:22.204
- You just saw me come outta there.
- ID, please.

15:32.004 --> 15:34.132
Oh! One second.

15:39.513 --> 15:42.391
It tickles!

15:56.446 --> 16:00.699
Y'know, Phil, this is actually
kind of an amazing opportunity.

16:00.783 --> 16:06.497
How many people get to say whatever
they want to Jason fucking Voorhees?

16:08.125 --> 16:10.793
Hey, fuck!

16:10.877 --> 16:15.840
How you doing, you fat-ass,
maggoty, blown-up fuck?

16:15.924 --> 16:17.716
Suck this!

16:17.800 --> 16:21.179
Suck it.
You know what I'd like to do to you?

16:21.513 --> 16:25.224
I'd like to take a crap
right on your fucking mask.

16:25.309 --> 16:29.061
A big, old, mango-sized crap.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.692
Yes,... that's a probe.

16:37.069 --> 16:38.322
Phil!

16:41.782 --> 16:43.243
Phil!

16:55.631 --> 16:59.800
So, doc, what's the verdict? Jason going
to be getting up and walking round soon?

16:59.884 --> 17:02.679
We really nailed that fucker.

17:04.931 --> 17:07.849
He weren't nothing
but a big old pussy, anyway.

17:07.934 --> 17:10.603
<i>Tonight on American Casefile.</i>

17:10.686 --> 17:13.939
<i>Jason Voorhees - dead or deadly?</i>

17:14.022 --> 17:17.736
<i>These photos were taken in the aftermath
of the autopsy ofJason Voorhees.</i>

17:17.986 --> 17:21.990
<i>The facts? Two security men - dead.</i>

17:22.198 --> 17:24.201
<i>A coroner - dead.</i>

17:24.367 --> 17:27.369
<i>Another coroner - missing.</i>

17:27.454 --> 17:31.707
<i>Are these men victims of a serial killer
only believed to be deceased?</i>

17:31.791 --> 17:32.834
<i>Many say yes.</i>

17:35.462 --> 17:36.796
<i>Hi, I'm Robert Campbell.</i>

17:36.880 --> 17:41.133
<i>For over 20 years, the mere mention
of the name Jason Voorhees...</i>

17:41.218 --> 17:44.971
<i>..has been enough to send a shudder
of fear through the hearts of a nation.</i>

17:45.055 --> 17:48.391
<i>Born in 1946
to Elias and Pamela Voorhees...</i>

17:48.475 --> 17:53.395
<i>..Jason was believed to have drowned in
Camp Crystal Lake at the age of eleven.</i>

17:53.479 --> 17:55.606
<i>Sadly, he did not.</i>

17:55.691 --> 17:59.192
<i>Since then, he has been responsible
for 83 confirmed murders...</i>

17:59.276 --> 18:01.486
<i>..and speculated scores of others.</i>

18:01.570 --> 18:06.075
<i>Tonight, on a very special episode
of American Casefile,...</i>

18:06.159 --> 18:08.577
<i>..we'll show you an interview
conducted with Mr Creighton Duke...</i>

18:08.662 --> 18:11.831
<i>..just one week after
Jason's alleged termination.</i>

18:11.915 --> 18:13.958
<i>Remember, Mr Duke
is the bounty hunter...</i>

18:14.042 --> 18:19.088
<i>..responsible for the capture of six of
this country's most reviled serial killers.</i>

18:19.172 --> 18:20.798
<i>Let's go to the tape.</i>

18:21.215 --> 18:26.387
For the first time, our cameras got
a glimpse of the training compound...

18:26.471 --> 18:28.305
..of bounty hunter Creighton Duke.

18:28.389 --> 18:33.011
Duke invited us with the promise of a very
unusual, very expensive proposition.

18:33.095 --> 18:36.264
And I think you'll agree,
in typical Creighton Duke fashion,...

18:36.348 --> 18:40.067
..he gave us much more
than we bargained for.

18:40.152 --> 18:41.903
Just watch.

18:42.361 --> 18:43.863
I'm going to say two words to you...

18:43.947 --> 18:47.032
..and I want you to say the first thing
that comes into your mind. Ok?

18:47.116 --> 18:48.701
- Ok.
- You ready?

18:48.785 --> 18:50.662
- Shoot.
- Jason Voorhees.

18:52.539 --> 18:55.750
Well, that makes me think of...

18:55.834 --> 18:59.838
..a little girl in a pink dress
sticking a hot dog through a doughnut.

19:02.507 --> 19:05.968
I was actually referring to your claim
that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead.

19:07.387 --> 19:10.931
What you think of as Jason...
is not Jason.

19:11.557 --> 19:14.476
That body he's wearing - that's just meat.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.354
The boy knows how to dress.

19:17.438 --> 19:20.858
He wears other people's bodies
like folks wear a suit.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.194
He might get blown up
but that's a minor inconvenience for him.

19:24.278 --> 19:26.531
He'll just get hisself another body.

19:27.115 --> 19:31.077
Jason Voorhees,
the true Jason Voorhees,...

19:31.244 --> 19:35.039
..is something you and I have
never seen before, Mr Campbell.

19:35.123 --> 19:39.459
There's only one way
to put an end to him for all time.

19:39.543 --> 19:44.216
And I'm the only one that knows the way.

19:44.506 --> 19:48.595
So if you want him dead, truly dead,...

19:49.345 --> 19:52.097
..500 grand is my fee.

19:52.181 --> 19:56.518
And for that you get the mask,
the machete, the whole damn thing.

19:56.727 --> 19:59.314
<i>Quite a character.</i>

20:00.356 --> 20:03.144
<i>In the week following
our interview with Creighton Duke,...</i>

20:03.228 --> 20:06.313
<i>..there have been five more
Jason-style murders.</i>

20:06.397 --> 20:08.781
<i>All, perhaps not surprisingly,...</i>

20:08.865 --> 20:11.569
<i>..on a direct path from the federal morgue
in Youngstown, Ohio,...</i>

20:11.653 --> 20:15.747
<i>..where Jason's remains were flown,...
to Crystal Lake.</i>

20:16.038 --> 20:19.207
<i>Tonight,...
in the interest of public safety,...</i>

20:19.291 --> 20:23.253
<i>..I am prepared to offer Creighton Duke
his sum of $500,000.</i>

20:23.338 --> 20:28.091
<i>Payable only after he provides American
Casefile and the American people...</i>

20:28.175 --> 20:31.172
<i>..with incontrovertible proof
of Jason's existence...</i>

20:31.256 --> 20:35.223
<i>..and then puts an end to him for all time.</i>

20:35.307 --> 20:39.020
<i>We'll be back with American Casefile
in a moment.</i>

20:52.742 --> 20:55.119
- This is truly sick.
- Tell me about it.

20:55.203 --> 20:57.871
No, this is not sick, Diana, it's business.

20:57.955 --> 21:01.625
People are gonna come to see
Jason's hometown with appetites.

21:01.710 --> 21:04.586
- Di, food's up.
- Thanks, Shel.

21:04.670 --> 21:08.298
Hey, Ma, do you really want me
to cut these like this?

21:08.383 --> 21:10.634
- Yes, I do.
- They look stupid.

21:10.718 --> 21:15.014
It's your own dumb-assed fault. They're
supposed to look like hockey masks!

21:16.098 --> 21:18.143
Now watch.

21:22.105 --> 21:25.441
This makes a whole new patty.
Hence, the two-for-one burger sale.

21:25.525 --> 21:28.777
God, I love this woman. Hold me back!

21:28.861 --> 21:31.489
You guys make me sick.

21:37.661 --> 21:39.663
What can I get you?

21:39.747 --> 21:43.626
I'll take a Voorhees burger
and a side of Jason fingers.

21:44.168 --> 21:46.420
Ok, anything else?

21:46.504 --> 21:47.130
Yes.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.216
Creighton Duke.

21:51.925 --> 21:53.762
I know who you are.

21:53.928 --> 21:57.015
I'm gonna kill Jason Voorhees.
I need you to help me.

21:57.390 --> 21:58.683
Jason Voorhees is dead.

21:59.851 --> 22:02.936
You know he's not, I know he's not.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.688
And he's coming for you.

22:05.023 --> 22:06.815
Your food'll be right out.

22:07.066 --> 22:08.983
Name your price.

22:09.067 --> 22:12.196
Everyone has a price. What's yours?

22:12.489 --> 22:15.616
- What do you want?
- You know what I want.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.159
And you know why I need you.

22:18.786 --> 22:20.495
I think you need to leave.

22:20.579 --> 22:24.583
I know everything about you, Diana.
I know who you really are.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.960
What's the problem here?

22:26.044 --> 22:30.297
I was just making your girlfriend
a little proposition, chief,...

22:30.381 --> 22:31.632
..she's thinking it over.

22:31.925 --> 22:33.509
Right, love?

22:33.759 --> 22:34.635
Go on. Get up.

22:36.011 --> 22:38.138
Why don't you blow me, chief. Mm?

22:38.223 --> 22:40.182
Right after your girlfriend gets through.

22:43.852 --> 22:46.020
That's my lady you're talking about.

22:46.104 --> 22:49.399
Now see, she is only your lady because...

22:49.484 --> 22:51.609
..she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.

22:51.693 --> 22:55.031
- Well, dammit!
- Careful, careful, chief.

22:55.531 --> 22:57.657
I don't think you really know who I am.

22:57.741 --> 22:59.701
I know who you are.

22:59.786 --> 23:03.872
The last thing we need here is some
freako bounty hunter causing trouble.

23:03.957 --> 23:06.833
I want you out of this town
and I want you out now.

23:06.917 --> 23:10.379
- Now that is very colourful, chief.
- Randy!

23:11.589 --> 23:14.465
Take him out to my car.
I'll be out in a minute.

23:14.549 --> 23:16.176
All right, let's go.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.513
He's coming for you, Diana.
And your daughter.

23:19.597 --> 23:21.640
Lock your doors.

23:23.850 --> 23:25.435
I'm sorry if he upset you.

23:25.687 --> 23:30.023
I don't need you to fight my battles.
I don't need any part-time protection!

23:31.733 --> 23:33.151
You Ok?

23:33.235 --> 23:36.530
- Yeah.
- Ok.

23:36.614 --> 23:39.908
Seems to think Jason's "coming for you".

23:40.618 --> 23:42.704
Stephen, I need to talk to you.

23:42.995 --> 23:47.832
There's something you don't know about
Jessica, something that you should know.

23:47.916 --> 23:51.920
She was gonna tell you herself,
but, uh, there may not be enough time.

23:52.005 --> 23:55.882
If you still care about her, if you still
wanna make things right between you,...

23:55.966 --> 23:57.926
..then we should talk.

23:58.010 --> 24:00.011
Ok, let's talk.

24:00.095 --> 24:02.096
Yeah, but not here.

24:02.180 --> 24:06.936
Come to my house tonight at eleven.
And don't be late.

24:23.368 --> 24:25.411
Ow!

24:25.495 --> 24:29.332
Ah-hah-hah-hah. Ow!

24:45.600 --> 24:47.685
Right!

24:47.769 --> 24:48.393
Hi.

24:48.935 --> 24:52.439
Thank you so much.
We have been there for an hour.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.400
Thanks a lot, man.

24:55.109 --> 24:57.736
So,... where we heading?

24:57.820 --> 24:59.654
We're going to Camp Crystal Lake.

24:59.739 --> 25:00.656
Oh, yeah?

25:00.822 --> 25:06.536
Planning on smoking dope, having
premarital sex and getting slaughtered?

25:10.499 --> 25:14.753
A joke. It's just a joke.
A little Crystal Lake levity.

25:16.630 --> 25:20.092
- So, uh, why are you going to the camp?
- Now that Jason's dead...

25:20.176 --> 25:22.838
We're thinking about smoking some dope,
having premarital sex...

25:22.922 --> 25:26.265
..and, uh, not worry about
getting slaughtered.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.684
Ah, to be young again.

25:33.980 --> 25:38.151
Here's where the camp was. They tore
the cabins down but this is the place.

25:38.236 --> 25:40.571
Excellent!

25:42.114 --> 25:44.367
Hey, thanks a lot.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.373
Come with us.

25:52.457 --> 25:54.460
We're thinking of going
skinny-dipping later.

25:56.086 --> 25:59.006
God. I'd love to...

25:59.090 --> 26:01.551
..but, um, I gotta meet someone later.

26:02.510 --> 26:05.470
Oh,... your girlfriend?

26:06.805 --> 26:08.890
Go on. Have fun.

26:13.853 --> 26:16.106
You don't know what you're missing.

26:36.669 --> 26:38.628
Let's do it.

26:53.351 --> 26:55.938
Oh, my God, that water.

26:57.189 --> 26:59.232
Ah! Ah!

27:15.750 --> 27:18.501
Oh!

27:19.461 --> 27:21.546
Shrank my pod!

27:21.630 --> 27:24.507
Your pod looks pretty good from here.

27:24.591 --> 27:26.551
Mm!

27:36.145 --> 27:38.064
Hey, come here.

27:46.238 --> 27:48.615
Um,...

27:48.741 --> 27:52.410
..do you mind if we use the tent
for half an hour?

27:52.494 --> 27:56.163
No, no, no. Actually, take it for the
whole night, I'm going to sleep out here.

27:56.247 --> 27:58.583
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I think it's a beautiful night.

27:58.667 --> 28:02.796
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah, l'm sure. Go... Go! Go!

28:02.921 --> 28:05.423
Go, go, go,... go, go...

28:49.300 --> 28:51.761
Damn!

30:02.373 --> 30:04.667
Come on, let's do it.

30:05.793 --> 30:08.046
You think you're ready
for Tony the Wonder Llama?

30:08.130 --> 30:10.340
You got a rubber?

30:10.548 --> 30:13.927
In my pack outside.

30:14.594 --> 30:17.089
- I'll get 'em.
- No! No, no, no,...

30:17.173 --> 30:20.225
Forget it. Forget about it.

30:23.144 --> 30:25.564
I gotta pee anyway.

30:26.690 --> 30:30.234
I have to go out there anyway.
I'll be right back.

30:30.319 --> 30:32.027
Oh!

30:32.111 --> 30:34.155
Hurry up.

31:23.914 --> 31:26.540
- I found it.
- Yeah?

31:26.624 --> 31:29.628
That's nice.

31:31.088 --> 31:33.799
Oh God, Debbie, I hate these things.

33:26.119 --> 33:29.623
Debbie! Help!

34:41.402 --> 34:44.864
Tango? Tango?

34:48.577 --> 34:53.371
Oh, there you are. Well, come here.

34:53.706 --> 34:57.294
There. Yeah.

34:57.459 --> 35:00.880
Oh, sweetheart, there you are. Yeah.

35:29.450 --> 35:31.826
Di, it's me, Josh.

35:31.910 --> 35:35.581
I... I was just going to my car.
I didn't mean to scare you.

35:35.665 --> 35:38.750
- Here.
- It's all right.

35:38.834 --> 35:41.462
Oh, thanks.

35:41.546 --> 35:43.756
Look, hon',...

35:44.299 --> 35:47.260
..don't worry about Ed, he'll come around.

35:47.344 --> 35:49.929
He's too smart a guy
to let you get away, you know?

35:50.013 --> 35:53.140
I guess I'm just a little, uh,
too old for going steady.

35:53.224 --> 35:58.228
So is he and he knows it.
Trust me... it'll work out.

35:59.813 --> 36:02.691
- Thanks.
- Good night, beautiful.

36:02.776 --> 36:05.612
Good night, Josh.

36:10.909 --> 36:13.827
Hello, baby.

36:13.911 --> 36:15.537
Not here. Oh, sorry I'm late.

36:15.621 --> 36:18.248
What's the big deal?
Did Roy's bowling go late?

36:18.332 --> 36:22.836
The League changed the damned time,
we've only got till ten thirty.

36:23.295 --> 36:25.090
Get in!

37:43.501 --> 37:44.877
Fuck!

37:46.628 --> 37:48.047
What the fuck are you doing?!

37:48.172 --> 37:49.924
You fuck!

38:09.944 --> 38:12.612
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom.

38:12.696 --> 38:15.782
- Hi.
- Guess what? I have a new boyfriend.

38:15.867 --> 38:18.076
- You'll never guess who.
- Well, what's his name?

38:18.161 --> 38:20.870
- I want it to be a surprise.
- Ah, someone I know?

38:20.954 --> 38:23.999
No, but you'll recognise him.

38:24.083 --> 38:28.671
We're gonna come for a visit next
weekend. He really wants to meet you.

38:28.838 --> 38:31.674
- Can you hold on just a second?
- Sure.

38:45.145 --> 38:45.813
Hi.

38:45.938 --> 38:49.942
- How's the baby?
- Great. Have you seen her father lately?

38:50.026 --> 38:53.486
- Steven's coming over tonight.
- Mom!

38:53.570 --> 38:55.948
- He's still asking about you.
- I don't wanna talk to him.

38:56.406 --> 38:59.826
I don't want to see him when I'm home.
He can see the baby if he wants.

38:59.994 --> 39:01.996
Can you tell him?

39:02.080 --> 39:04.332
- I'll tell him.
- I love you, Mom.

39:04.499 --> 39:07.627
I love you, too, baby. Um...

39:11.338 --> 39:12.214
Mom?

39:13.965 --> 39:17.261
What are you doing? Josh!

39:17.427 --> 39:18.680
Oh, Jesus!

39:19.888 --> 39:22.140
No! No!

39:29.273 --> 39:31.149
You mother...

39:31.275 --> 39:33.568
..fucker!

39:37.447 --> 39:40.034
Yes, hi. Is Sheriff Landis there?

39:40.867 --> 39:43.830
This is Jessica kimble.
Could you please patch me through?

40:16.528 --> 40:17.821
No!

40:17.947 --> 40:20.032
No!

40:21.242 --> 40:22.784
Diana?

40:58.029 --> 40:59.613
Oh, shit!

41:35.942 --> 41:39.152
You saw him.

41:39.236 --> 41:41.780
You know who he is?

41:42.823 --> 41:45.533
You have to save Jessica.

41:45.617 --> 41:49.204
Save Jessica and the...

41:49.705 --> 41:51.915
The what?!

41:51.999 --> 41:54.751
Save Jessica...

41:54.835 --> 41:56.878
..and...

41:58.004 --> 42:00.216
Diana?

42:05.095 --> 42:06.972
It was Josh.

42:07.098 --> 42:08.432
He's still outsi...

42:11.726 --> 42:12.852
Where the hell is he?

42:12.937 --> 42:16.481
Oh,... my dear God.

42:16.649 --> 42:18.566
He was dead. He had to be dead!

42:30.705 --> 42:33.040
Y-y-y-you can't think that I...?

42:38.879 --> 42:42.674
I don't believe you murdered Diana.
I don't know what happened.

42:42.758 --> 42:45.343
And I know you couldn't have done it.

42:48.597 --> 42:50.640
You just sit tight, eh?

42:50.725 --> 42:52.892
I will straighten everything out.

42:54.186 --> 42:56.563
Randy, what am I gonna do?

42:58.857 --> 43:01.317
What's Jessica gonna do?

43:28.512 --> 43:33.516
Jessica! I'm, uh,... I'm so sorry. I wanted to
have this cleaned up before you got here.

43:33.600 --> 43:34.977
That's all right. I was just...

43:37.688 --> 43:41.232
Oh, God...

43:53.203 --> 43:55.039
Oh, my gosh!

43:58.626 --> 44:00.627
Who's this?

44:04.255 --> 44:06.090
A girl?

44:06.174 --> 44:08.926
She's beautiful.

44:09.010 --> 44:10.178
She yours?

44:10.762 --> 44:13.264
Her name's Stephanie.

44:14.182 --> 44:15.934
She has Steven's eyes.

44:18.728 --> 44:20.356
Why didn't you tell me?

44:20.688 --> 44:24.360
I was going to. I was going to
tell everybody, I just didn't...

44:24.859 --> 44:27.737
I didn't expect to be back here so soon.

44:27.821 --> 44:29.156
Is Steven around?

44:37.997 --> 44:43.378
Yeah. Listen, there's... There's something
I need to tell you about Steven.

44:48.008 --> 44:50.509
Hopefully, we won't have to hold you
for more than a day.

44:50.593 --> 44:53.554
I am going to bust my ass
to prove that you are innocent.

44:53.638 --> 44:58.685
But you are gonna have to stay cool cos
otherwise Landis is gonna kill you, Ok?

45:06.402 --> 45:08.612
Come on.

45:09.362 --> 45:12.282
The sheriff's right this way.

45:26.922 --> 45:30.460
All right, I'll be back later.
Don't do anything stupid.

45:30.544 --> 45:33.886
What am I gonna do?
I'm locked in a fricking cell.

45:33.970 --> 45:36.431
I'm gonna get you out of this
but you gotta hang tight.

45:39.309 --> 45:41.519
Ok.

45:49.111 --> 45:52.321
Oh, wait.
Everything you need is in this bag.

45:52.405 --> 45:55.450
- Yeah. Ok.
- White bottle: twelve o'clock.

45:55.617 --> 45:59.662
- Green bottle: one, one thirty.
- And hard liquor at dinner time

45:59.747 --> 46:01.622
Don't worry.

46:03.124 --> 46:04.625
What time would you like me
to pick her up?

46:04.710 --> 46:07.086
Um,... come by the diner around eight.

46:07.171 --> 46:11.215
Ok. Bye, sweetheart. Don't you
give Vicki a hard time. Bye-bye.

46:11.299 --> 46:13.677
Thanks, Vicki.

46:14.303 --> 46:16.304
Hey, you take good care of her.

46:16.388 --> 46:20.599
- Of course.
- Jessie, I got a few papers here,...

46:20.683 --> 46:24.354
- ..if I can get your signature on them.
- All right.

46:25.147 --> 46:30.943
You're about
the saddest-looking sack of shit I've seen.

46:31.028 --> 46:33.029
Why don't you just shut up?

46:33.572 --> 46:35.573
Accused of murder.

46:35.657 --> 46:40.746
And not just any murder, but the murder
of the mother of the girl you love.

46:41.078 --> 46:42.915
I didn't do it.

46:43.122 --> 46:45.833
Oh, I know that. Problem is...

46:45.918 --> 46:49.795
..how you gonna get anyone else
to believe you?

46:53.424 --> 46:55.844
It was Jason that killed Diana.

46:56.928 --> 46:58.555
What did you say?

46:58.722 --> 47:02.351
There's only one way
to put an end to that devil.

47:03.435 --> 47:05.562
And they don't know the way.

47:09.024 --> 47:11.192
And you do?

47:13.653 --> 47:17.532
- Tell me!
- Information like that... is very expensive.

47:17.865 --> 47:22.078
- What's your price?
- You're too much of a coward to afford it.

47:25.289 --> 47:27.458
Try me.

47:37.970 --> 47:39.971
Give me your hand.

47:41.473 --> 47:44.225
- What?
- Your hand,...

47:44.309 --> 47:45.768
..give it to me.

47:54.444 --> 47:55.653
See,...

47:56.028 --> 47:59.448
..everything and everyone...

47:59.533 --> 48:01.660
..has a price.

48:01.994 --> 48:05.080
And the cost of this is very, very high.

48:06.664 --> 48:08.624
Are you ready to pay?

48:11.962 --> 48:15.715
- What's the price?
- Are you ready to pay?

48:18.427 --> 48:19.219
Yes.

48:25.558 --> 48:28.186
Ow! Fuck!

48:38.280 --> 48:42.158
The only way to kill Jason Voorhees
is to destroy his heart.

48:42.242 --> 48:45.661
And there's only one person can do that
now that Diana's dead.

48:45.746 --> 48:47.829
Her daughter.

48:47.913 --> 48:51.251
- Jessica?
- And he will try to get to her first.

48:51.418 --> 48:54.045
- Well, what does he want?
- Same thing he wanted her mother for.

48:54.296 --> 48:56.173
What?

48:58.133 --> 49:00.052
You want information,...

49:01.386 --> 49:02.471
..you gotta pay.

49:05.390 --> 49:07.016
Come on!

49:07.183 --> 49:08.476
Your hand.

49:15.399 --> 49:17.651
- You ready to pay?
- Yes.

49:18.068 --> 49:21.406
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

49:23.492 --> 49:26.703
Ooh, Jeez! Ow.

49:30.707 --> 49:34.584
Those FBI idiots destroyed Jason's body
so now he needs a new one.

49:34.668 --> 49:37.338
The ones he's jumping in and out of,
they can't last.

49:37.422 --> 49:40.048
They get diseased, he gets weak.

49:40.132 --> 49:43.594
Jason needs to be reborn again
and he needs Jessica to do it.

49:43.720 --> 49:45.095
Why Jessica?

49:46.223 --> 49:50.767
Now, see, that is a very, very
expensive question, boy.

49:50.851 --> 49:56.107
And... I don't think you've got what it takes
to pay the price.

49:59.610 --> 50:02.030
Tell me.

50:25.594 --> 50:27.304
This one's on the house.

50:29.932 --> 50:35.104
In a Voorhees was he born,
through a Voorhees may he be reborn.

50:35.521 --> 50:38.524
And only by the hands of a Voorhees
will he die.

50:39.275 --> 50:41.319
Jason had a sister:...

50:41.735 --> 50:44.655
..your girlfriend's mother, Diana.

50:45.073 --> 50:47.158
Now that she's dead,...

50:47.242 --> 50:52.204
..he has only two blood relatives left
in the world with the power to kill him...

50:52.288 --> 50:55.000
..or make him reborn.

50:55.124 --> 50:57.127
Jessica and her baby.

50:57.544 --> 50:59.421
I've gotta get outta here.
I've gotta protect them.

50:59.545 --> 51:06.094
The only way to do that is to kill Jason
and you can't! But Jessica can.

51:06.218 --> 51:09.721
Tell Jessica about her birthright.
Make her believe you.

51:09.805 --> 51:12.017
Go to the Voorhees' house. Find proof.

51:12.266 --> 51:15.352
Because if you don't, Jason will kill her...

51:15.437 --> 51:16.938
..and your baby.

51:19.607 --> 51:21.984
Randy! Randy!

51:23.320 --> 51:25.362
Agh! God.

51:25.446 --> 51:29.032
- What the hell's going on?
- That son of a bitch broke my fingers.

51:29.116 --> 51:32.787
- Jesus! Shit!
- Let me take a look, Ok? Here.

51:36.331 --> 51:38.710
Shit!

51:39.878 --> 51:41.962
Quiet.

51:42.046 --> 51:44.006
You asshole.

51:44.090 --> 51:45.507
Ok,...

51:45.592 --> 51:50.305
..carefully, carefully, open the cell.

51:50.764 --> 51:53.390
You wouldn't kill me.

51:53.474 --> 51:55.976
You might be right.

51:58.812 --> 52:01.523
Ok. Ok, Steven.

52:11.784 --> 52:15.079
Steven,... listen to me, please?

52:15.788 --> 52:20.000
Don't do this.
You escape, they'll shoot you on sight.

52:25.380 --> 52:28.634
That's a chance I'm gonna have to take.

52:30.011 --> 52:32.303
So I lose a bundle today.

52:32.387 --> 52:34.264
Screw it.

52:34.348 --> 52:36.851
I loved that little lady.

52:36.935 --> 52:40.145
Don't pretend to be so noble. You should
have closed up until after the funeral.

52:40.229 --> 52:43.690
- Sure. Two days off with pay, right?
- Hey, hey, baby. Not now.

52:43.775 --> 52:48.321
Believe it or not, I'm hurt too, and
not just financially. What the fuck is that?

52:48.488 --> 52:52.282
- It's Jessica's baby.
- Get it the fuck out. This isn't a nursery.

52:52.575 --> 52:58.413
Hey. I believe that's the sweetest thing
God ever put on this earth.

52:58.497 --> 53:02.043
- You's a little cutie pie.
- It'll be as cute on the street. Get it out!

53:04.128 --> 53:06.713
Yeah? Yeah.

53:07.423 --> 53:09.800
No shit?

53:12.511 --> 53:14.805
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

53:14.889 --> 53:17.099
Yeah. If I see him, I'll call.

53:17.183 --> 53:18.850
Ok.

53:18.934 --> 53:20.894
- What was that all about?
- Hey, the baby can stay.

53:20.979 --> 53:25.900
Go to the storeroom and make a crib out
of a box or something. Go, go, go, go, go!

53:28.361 --> 53:33.782
- Steven Freeman escaped. With a gun.
- Jesus. They know where he's headed?

53:34.158 --> 53:37.995
knowing Freeman, he turned ass
and he bolted to Canada.

53:38.079 --> 53:40.330
But just in case he didn't...

53:40.415 --> 53:43.293
Hey, let me do it.

53:47.130 --> 53:48.297
Oh!

53:49.382 --> 53:50.841
Jesus, Pookie.

53:56.305 --> 53:59.058
Ok, we got your bear.

53:59.142 --> 54:02.143
I know this isn't a palace
but it'll have to do.

54:02.227 --> 54:05.314
God, you look so much like your daddy.

54:06.691 --> 54:09.234
Ok,... we'll put you in here.

54:09.318 --> 54:14.032
I'll come back and check on you,
make sure you're Ok. Ok?

54:32.758 --> 54:35.009
Oh, Jesus.

54:35.093 --> 54:37.888
I don't even know your name.

54:39.097 --> 54:41.308
Steven.

54:42.851 --> 54:45.145
This is... my baby.

54:47.981 --> 54:51.569
It's the first time I've ever
been able to touch my baby.

54:56.115 --> 54:58.032
Take my car. Get out.

54:58.116 --> 55:00.745
- Ward, I...
- Get out.

55:01.912 --> 55:03.330
Thank you.

55:22.933 --> 55:25.269
Oh, Christ.

56:05.351 --> 56:07.311
Oh, my...!

57:01.740 --> 57:03.491
No!

57:51.791 --> 57:53.124
Yah?

57:53.208 --> 57:55.793
Hey, Reggie, what's happening?

57:55.877 --> 57:59.463
Oh, yeah, I'm there now.
It's great, it's disgusting.

57:59.547 --> 58:04.302
Look, I want to dress stuff. Maybe we can
put a few body parts in the refrigerator?

58:04.387 --> 58:07.096
Well, Reg, talk to Harry in props.

58:07.180 --> 58:09.015
You know what we're going for here:...

58:09.099 --> 58:11.935
.. Twisted Secrets of the Voorhees' House
Revealed.

58:12.019 --> 58:13.145
Oh, and also,...

58:13.269 --> 58:14.522
..one more thing.

58:14.647 --> 58:18.150
Guess what tomorrow's headline
is gonna read?

58:19.901 --> 58:24.531
Body of Slain Voorhees' Woman
Stolen from Morgue.

58:24.615 --> 58:29.702
Well, last night, I stole Diana's body
and I hid it here in the closet.

58:29.787 --> 58:33.456
And then I went home
and fucked her daughter.

58:35.501 --> 58:37.044
Reg.

58:37.795 --> 58:39.754
Reg, Reg, you wanna calm down.

58:39.839 --> 58:43.674
Listen, I talked Jessica
into letting us shoot here, right?

58:43.758 --> 58:46.879
I'll bring the police,
they'll discover the body on camera,...

58:46.963 --> 58:49.265
..and our ratings will go
right through the fucking roof!

58:49.390 --> 58:51.057
How does that grab you?

58:52.976 --> 58:54.310
Jesus! Aagh!

01:01:18.372 --> 01:01:19.789
Robert?

01:01:31.634 --> 01:01:33.804
Hello?

01:02:57.512 --> 01:03:00.716
You scared the hell out of me.
Where have you been?

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.060
Robert!

01:03:04.352 --> 01:03:06.395
Get away from her!

01:03:06.771 --> 01:03:08.898
What... Where are you taking me?

01:03:08.982 --> 01:03:13.152
- Come on!
- What? My God! Steven, put me down.

01:03:13.236 --> 01:03:16.029
I don't want to go with you.
I am gonna kill you!

01:03:16.113 --> 01:03:18.407
You put me down this second.
I'm gonna kill you!

01:03:18.491 --> 01:03:21.945
- Oh!
- Get in the car. Get in the car!

01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:25.040
What is wrong? What is going on?

01:03:25.164 --> 01:03:26.333
- Will somebody tell me?
- Shut up!

01:03:31.837 --> 01:03:32.588
Shit.

01:03:34.591 --> 01:03:39.137
Oh! Oh! Oh, my God.

01:03:55.779 --> 01:03:58.698
God, Steven!

01:04:02.493 --> 01:04:07.541
Pull this car over!
Steven, I mean it! Stop this car!

01:04:10.501 --> 01:04:13.046
- What, are you out of your mind?!
- Just calm down. Shut the fuck up!

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:14.922
Please. Just listen.

01:04:15.089 --> 01:04:18.509
All right. Now you think I killed Robert
back there, right?

01:04:18.677 --> 01:04:23.305
And there's no way he could've lived?
Just tell me, did I kill him or not?

01:04:23.472 --> 01:04:25.433
- Yes, you killed him.
- Wrong.

01:04:25.599 --> 01:04:27.811
He is not dead and that is not Robert.

01:04:27.936 --> 01:04:31.189
Jess, I did not kill your mother.

01:04:31.313 --> 01:04:35.776
Yesterday, Josh, or someone
that looked like Josh, killed her.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.820
That was after she blew off
the back of his head.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:41.116
I stabbed him with a poker through
the heart and the son of a bitch still lived.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:42.408
Steven, please let me go.

01:04:42.492 --> 01:04:45.704
You and the baby are in danger.
I can help.

01:04:46.705 --> 01:04:47.998
I won't leave you this time, Jess.

01:04:48.122 --> 01:04:52.002
- Yeah, you will, Steven.
- I promise I won't.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.631
Jess,... let's go to the baby.

01:05:00.468 --> 01:05:03.387
Fucking psycho! You killed my mother,
you think I'd let you near my baby?!

01:05:03.554 --> 01:05:07.975
- Ow!
- Out! Out, get out! Get away from me!

01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.352
Come on!

01:05:10.436 --> 01:05:12.146
- Jess, please!
- Get away from me!

01:05:12.272 --> 01:05:15.357
- Get away!
- Jess! Jess!

01:05:15.442 --> 01:05:17.903
Damn it. No! No.

01:05:24.742 --> 01:05:29.371
Ed! Ed! I just left Steven
out on Lake Road. He killed Robert!

01:05:29.455 --> 01:05:32.833
- Slow down. You all right?
- He ran him over. I was at my mother's...

01:05:32.917 --> 01:05:35.628
- Did he hurt you?
- Not me. Robert!

01:05:35.712 --> 01:05:39.506
- You said he's on Lake Road. Where?
- I don't know.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:44.804
- Past the Meyers' place.
- Ok, we'll get him. You're safe now.

01:05:44.888 --> 01:05:47.682
Notify all the units on the Lake Road.
I want this kid.

01:06:02.071 --> 01:06:03.740
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:06:05.867 --> 01:06:06.534
Oh, Randy.

01:06:08.243 --> 01:06:10.372
Son of a bitch!

01:06:15.126 --> 01:06:17.378
Fuck this!

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.929
- Hey, you Ok?
- Agh!

01:06:37.356 --> 01:06:39.359
God. Oh!

01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:43.613
Get in the fucking car, Steven.

01:06:44.364 --> 01:06:46.156
You get in the car!

01:06:46.241 --> 01:06:48.283
You want me to cuff you?

01:06:48.368 --> 01:06:50.869
What makes you think you can?

01:06:50.953 --> 01:06:53.080
I got a gun!

01:06:53.164 --> 01:06:54.664
Fuck that.

01:06:54.748 --> 01:06:56.291
I got a gun.

01:06:58.503 --> 01:06:59.838
You totally wrecked Jessica.

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:03.800
- Jessica. You've seen Jessica?
- Yes, I have seen Jessica.

01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:05.259
Where is she?

01:07:06.136 --> 01:07:07.302
At the station.

01:07:08.846 --> 01:07:10.140
Cuff me.

01:07:10.306 --> 01:07:11.682
Cuff me!

01:07:13.893 --> 01:07:17.271
Randy just picked Steven up.
He's bringing him in.

01:07:17.355 --> 01:07:19.898
Jessie, follow Officer Ryan.
She'll give you some clothes.

01:07:20.024 --> 01:07:22.401
All we have are cop uniforms.

01:07:22.485 --> 01:07:23.360
Anything's fine.

01:07:25.237 --> 01:07:27.406
One sec.

01:07:27.615 --> 01:07:29.909
You all right, mister? Wait a second.

01:07:29.993 --> 01:07:31.535
What the...?

01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.666
You find her and you find her quick.

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:40.002
Yeah. I'll wait to hear from you.

01:07:52.514 --> 01:07:54.683
Stop right there!

01:08:05.527 --> 01:08:07.988
Steven, help me!

01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:09.949
Jessica!

01:08:13.453 --> 01:08:15.497
Move!

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:34.224
What in the hell was that?

01:08:37.268 --> 01:08:39.310
Officer down!

01:08:39.395 --> 01:08:41.188
He's breathing.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:44.107
Let's check this guy at the end of the hall.

01:08:44.191 --> 01:08:45.567
Fuck!

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:48.363
Christ!

01:08:49.947 --> 01:08:51.032
Get the ambulance.

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:02.502
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:07.631
Agh!

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.024
- Vick, where's the baby?
- She's fine.

01:09:27.109 --> 01:09:29.319
- Where's the baby?
- She's in the back.

01:09:29.403 --> 01:09:31.363
Whoa! Hold it right there.

01:09:31.447 --> 01:09:33.490
Don't move a fucking muscle,
either of you.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:34.115
Joanne...

01:09:34.198 --> 01:09:37.243
Shut up. You're with him. Nobody's gonna
touch that fucking ray of sunshine.

01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:41.707
- Pookie, call the station.
- I'm doing it, baby, I'm doing it.

01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:43.499
Holy shit.

01:09:43.582 --> 01:09:45.960
Line's dead.

01:09:46.044 --> 01:09:49.923
Son of a bitch. Ward, go and see
what's going on at the station.

01:09:50.006 --> 01:09:53.169
- Don't let him go. He'll get killed.
- Shut up! Go on.

01:09:53.252 --> 01:09:55.094
- Ma, he just...
- Ward!

01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:59.599
- Little mister, just in case.
- Whoo!

01:10:02.102 --> 01:10:05.813
- Honey, watch the willy.
- Ma!

01:10:05.897 --> 01:10:10.528
- Ward, don't. Please.
- Shut up! keep your hands up - high.

01:10:11.904 --> 01:10:13.072
Bad-dang!

01:10:13.321 --> 01:10:15.198
Bad-dang!

01:10:22.582 --> 01:10:25.500
Joey, please.
Just let me get the baby and we'll go.

01:10:25.585 --> 01:10:29.046
- Shut the fuck up. You're with a felon.
- Hey, now, babe, watch the language.

01:10:29.171 --> 01:10:31.214
Fuck you!

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:38.674
- Now look what you've fucking done!
- Give me the baby, Joey!

01:10:38.758 --> 01:10:41.224
Fuck you!

01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:42.185
Sorry.

01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:44.561
Stop. I mean it.

01:11:17.678 --> 01:11:19.597
Come on!

01:11:25.311 --> 01:11:28.940
Go. Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:37.947
She's gone.

01:11:38.031 --> 01:11:40.318
- Where is she?
- Vicki must have moved her.

01:11:40.402 --> 01:11:42.744
In here. Come on.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.749
She's gotta be in here.

01:11:54.465 --> 01:11:56.883
- Holy shit!
- Pookie!

01:12:00.179 --> 01:12:02.930
Don't let him through.

01:12:03.014 --> 01:12:05.017
Stop!

01:12:05.308 --> 01:12:09.062
Oh... shit!

01:12:12.275 --> 01:12:14.902
Get away from him,
you fucking piece of shit, skull-faced,...

01:12:15.069 --> 01:12:16.528
..cocksucker, motherfucker!

01:12:28.206 --> 01:12:29.625
Jess!

01:12:29.834 --> 01:12:31.127
Ah! No!

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.615
Go to hell!

01:13:25.056 --> 01:13:27.349
Oh God, Vick.

01:13:34.231 --> 01:13:35.648
I'm gonna try and get some help.

01:13:50.998 --> 01:13:51.706
Shit.

01:13:54.126 --> 01:13:55.919
Jessica!

01:13:56.461 --> 01:13:58.297
Jessica, wait!

01:13:58.588 --> 01:14:01.090
Fuck! Damn.

01:14:15.355 --> 01:14:20.027
I have your baby.
Come to the Voorhees' house alone.

01:14:40.297 --> 01:14:41.714
Christ.

01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:54.351
You're alone.

01:14:54.435 --> 01:14:56.354
Good girl.

01:14:56.438 --> 01:15:00.984
Jason could have jumped
into anyone by now but you.

01:15:01.777 --> 01:15:04.737
We haven't been formally introduced.

01:15:04.822 --> 01:15:06.447
My name is Creighton Duke.

01:15:06.532 --> 01:15:11.160
What the hell do you think you're doing
grabbing my baby and bringing her here?

01:15:11.244 --> 01:15:12.036
Hold it.

01:15:14.373 --> 01:15:17.041
Duke, Robert is dead.

01:15:17.125 --> 01:15:21.379
I know about your bounty but you're
never gonna see any of that money now.

01:15:21.463 --> 01:15:23.464
It's over.

01:15:23.549 --> 01:15:25.676
Just give me the baby.

01:15:28.761 --> 01:15:31.348
Just give me two minutes.

01:15:47.447 --> 01:15:50.158
It's not about the money any more.

01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:04.380
- What do you want from me?
- Tonight we can get that bastard.

01:16:04.464 --> 01:16:09.134
Tonight we can send Jason Voorhees
to hell for all time.

01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:11.013
- You don't need me for that.
- Yes,...

01:16:11.972 --> 01:16:12.598
..I do!

01:16:19.562 --> 01:16:22.066
Only through a Voorhees
can he be reborn,...

01:16:22.190 --> 01:16:24.775
..and only a Voorhees can kill him.

01:16:24.859 --> 01:16:25.778
With that!

01:16:25.903 --> 01:16:28.529
No. I won't put my baby
in any more danger.

01:16:28.696 --> 01:16:32.325
You will always be in danger
until Jason is dead.

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:37.830
He won't stop coming for you
until he gets you, until he's reborn.

01:16:37.915 --> 01:16:40.082
And then he will kill you...

01:16:40.166 --> 01:16:41.710
..and your baby.

01:16:43.045 --> 01:16:48.251
If you want this to be over,
if you want your baby out of danger,...

01:16:48.335 --> 01:16:50.259
..then you will end it now.

01:16:50.344 --> 01:16:54.389
Before more people have to die,
like your friends, like your mother.

01:16:55.014 --> 01:16:57.475
Because until you kill him,...

01:16:58.976 --> 01:17:01.563
..it will never be over.

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:45.315
Oh, are you sleepy?

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:53.197
Mm? That could be Steven.

01:17:53.282 --> 01:17:55.617
Jason will have jumped
into a new body by now.

01:17:55.909 --> 01:17:58.160
You can't trust anyone.

01:17:58.245 --> 01:18:00.997
- It couldn't be Steven.
- Anyone. Do you understand?

01:18:02.791 --> 01:18:04.417
Duke!

01:18:05.418 --> 01:18:07.254
Jessica?

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:08.629
- Ed?
- No!

01:18:08.755 --> 01:18:12.009
- Oh, no!
- Shit!

01:18:12.759 --> 01:18:15.220
kill him! Do it!

01:18:15.344 --> 01:18:17.222
Ed, is it really you?

01:18:17.306 --> 01:18:18.723
- Of course.
- Stay there!

01:18:18.807 --> 01:18:21.017
- Give me the knife.
- I thought you were dead.

01:18:21.143 --> 01:18:23.061
- You were wrong.
- Don't come any closer.

01:18:23.186 --> 01:18:24.354
- Kill him!
- I can't!

01:18:24.478 --> 01:18:26.397
- Oh...
- Freeze!

01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:29.066
Get the hell away from her, Ed!

01:18:34.698 --> 01:18:37.033
- Duke, what should I do?
- kill the both of them!

01:18:37.199 --> 01:18:38.869
- No!
- Do it, or die!

01:18:38.993 --> 01:18:41.330
Jessica, give me the knife.

01:18:41.454 --> 01:18:42.914
- Stay back!
- Jessica!

01:18:47.085 --> 01:18:47.878
Oh!

01:18:50.714 --> 01:18:51.465
Shit!

01:19:07.898 --> 01:19:10.150
Get off! Get away from her!

01:19:11.693 --> 01:19:12.861
Steven!

01:19:45.393 --> 01:19:46.852
Where is it?!

01:19:47.019 --> 01:19:48.938
I don't know!

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:00.783
Duke?!

01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:02.284
I'm coming.

01:20:02.452 --> 01:20:05.329
- I'll help you.
- Give me your hand.

01:20:06.330 --> 01:20:09.416
Come on!

01:20:16.341 --> 01:20:17.300
Here!

01:20:19.928 --> 01:20:21.304
Hurry!

01:20:31.146 --> 01:20:33.065
- Where's the dagger?
- It's under the dresser.

01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:35.860
Well, get it!

01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:38.904
I don't think so. Oh, God.

01:20:39.321 --> 01:20:40.823
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

01:20:40.907 --> 01:20:43.653
Duke, that part about being
reborn in a Voorhees woman,...

01:20:43.737 --> 01:20:45.370
- ..does it have to be a living woman?
- No.

01:20:45.495 --> 01:20:48.831
That thing's in the basement
with Jessica's mother.

01:20:52.752 --> 01:20:54.629
Holy Mother of God.

01:21:01.928 --> 01:21:04.889
Quick, the dagger.

01:21:05.015 --> 01:21:06.308
Help her!

01:21:06.474 --> 01:21:07.809
Get the damn dagger!

01:21:07.933 --> 01:21:09.728
- Lift it up, lift it up!
- Ok.

01:21:11.937 --> 01:21:13.439
- I can't!
- Jessica!

01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:17.818
You son of a bitch. You remember me?

01:21:26.201 --> 01:21:27.161
Get the dagger!

01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:34.460
Tonight, my friend, you will...

01:21:34.668 --> 01:21:36.212
Jessica!

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.080
..die!

01:21:40.425 --> 01:21:41.717
Duke!

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.555
Oh, God!

01:21:57.609 --> 01:22:00.402
Get away from them,
motherfucker!

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.188
No!

01:23:07.886 --> 01:23:10.013
Oh!

01:23:18.148 --> 01:23:19.314
No.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.440
Go... to... hell!

01:24:43.566 --> 01:24:44.692
Agh!

01:25:07.256 --> 01:25:08.508
No! No!

01:25:09.717 --> 01:25:11.594
No!

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.040
No!

01:25:16.305 --> 01:25:22.349
