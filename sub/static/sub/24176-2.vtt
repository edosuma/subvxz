00:35.160 --> 00:38.528
MARCH 23rd

00:51.927 --> 00:55.921
Before the balloting,
the ball is put in the freezer,

00:57.891 --> 01:01.475
so when it's taken from
the ballot box it's recognizable

01:02.062 --> 01:03.894
to the touch.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.896
Long live the free market!

01:06.066 --> 01:07.773
The free market?

01:10.821 --> 01:13.438
Nobody cares about that,

01:13.657 --> 01:15.443
it's in no one's interest.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.028
The price is fixed,
the deals are split

01:20.664 --> 01:22.746
then the contract winner
pays the parties,

01:23.250 --> 01:26.914
some get 5%, or sometimes 10%,

01:27.129 --> 01:30.793
37.5% of which
goes to the Socialist Party,

01:31.883 --> 01:35.251
18.75% to the DC or PCI

01:35.470 --> 01:38.258
and then less and less
for the smaller parties.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.973
But who picks up the money
for the parties?

01:41.059 --> 01:43.050
Let's not start from the corrupted,

01:43.812 --> 01:45.598
but from the corrupters.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.181
You mean the industrialists?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.267
They'd line up to pay,

01:51.486 --> 01:54.274
they came to me,
I never called anyone,

01:54.489 --> 01:56.696
I never asked anyone for anything.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.858
Would you like names?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.740
Mazzanti, Rovelli, Baldi...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.834
Zardo...

02:09.588 --> 02:10.874
Cremoni...

02:12.341 --> 02:13.502
Rossi...

02:13.717 --> 02:15.378
Mainaghi.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.839
We'll summon all of these.

02:22.059 --> 02:26.018
Mum's the word until elections
or Borrelli will kill me.

02:27.022 --> 02:30.435
<i>They broke Italy up,
although now they say the opposite.</i>

02:30.651 --> 02:33.643
<i>North, Center, South,</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:36.065
<i>different realities</i>

02:36.281 --> 02:38.147
<i>with different problems.</i>

02:39.117 --> 02:41.108
<i>Only a federal state</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:45.697
<i>is able to give
this country real answers.</i>

02:47.459 --> 02:50.417
<i>With the Northern League,
the country will be reborn.</i>

02:53.048 --> 02:55.289
Strong, but incisive.
What do you say?

02:55.676 --> 02:56.962
Dunno...

02:57.177 --> 03:01.045
Dunno? At the rally,
you'll have to be a bit more verbal!

03:01.515 --> 03:03.051
What rally?

03:03.183 --> 03:06.016
What rally! On April 2, in Varese.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.803
Wake up! It's the closure
of the election campaign.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.013
I don't have to speak!

03:11.191 --> 03:14.604
Are you a candidate or not?
The League people want to know you.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.235
What the fuck do I say?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.772
Point 1:

03:20.033 --> 03:23.492
limit the taxation power
of the state and the local agencies.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.948
Point 2:

03:25.163 --> 03:29.373
recognize enterprise in
the Constitution and defend it.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.540
Point 3: limit the presence
of the state in the economy.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.630
- Mr. Notte...
- Hello.

03:36.842 --> 03:39.834
- Put them there... Clara, right?
- Yes, Clara.

03:40.846 --> 03:45.215
I was wondering:
what do I write on the door?

03:45.434 --> 03:49.849
Excuse the question, but
I don't know why you were hired.

03:50.021 --> 03:53.309
To make the company more money.
What's this?

03:53.525 --> 03:55.607
This? It's the past,

03:55.819 --> 03:59.608
the list of advertisers,
by category, from 1980 to today.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.524
Enzo Biagi,
"A History of Italy in Comics".

04:03.702 --> 04:06.410
Mr. Dell'Utri thought it was funny!

04:07.622 --> 04:09.238
And what's that?

04:09.458 --> 04:11.040
The present,

04:11.251 --> 04:15.245
the 1991-1992 programming
plus all the group's periodicals.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.255
And this is the future.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.847
So, you decided
to do like United Fruit Company,

05:16.024 --> 05:18.436
in a recession,
hire an advertising agent.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.017
Something like that,

05:20.237 --> 05:23.104
after all
we need to keep selling bananas!

05:23.865 --> 05:26.948
I'm studying the programming,
and have some interesting ideas.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.115
How do you vote?

05:31.540 --> 05:35.033
I don't,
I'm not interested in politics.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.496
Many people like you
don't feel represented.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.044
Why's that?

05:47.222 --> 05:49.213
The supply doesn't satisfy
the demand.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.423
That's how you see it?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.218
Do you know Séguéla,

05:54.437 --> 05:57.429
the advertising agent who
did Mitterrand's campaign?

05:57.691 --> 06:00.854
He treated politicians
like products, detergents.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.559
That's how I see it.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.238
I want you to go to Rome with Lodato,

06:06.783 --> 06:08.114
to explore the territory,

06:08.243 --> 06:11.361
get an idea about those who will be

06:11.454 --> 06:12.865
tomorrow's detergents.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.909
I thought I was to deal with business.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.578
In Italy there is no business

06:17.669 --> 06:19.455
without politics.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.171
If who's in command is weak today,
we have to understand

06:23.258 --> 06:24.919
who'll be in charge tomorrow.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.173
Next week's elections
should clarify that.

06:29.139 --> 06:33.053
As a young man, in Palermo, I was
president of a small soccer team,

06:33.852 --> 06:36.310
the Bacigalupo,
and we needed a coach.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.352
I hired this unknown Bohemian

06:40.692 --> 06:42.603
who was running from the Communists.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.022
- Zeman?
- Zeman.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.317
Now see his Foggia,
the team of miracles!

06:47.532 --> 06:50.695
His attack formation, 4-3-3,
is a revolutionary idea.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.953
I expect one from you too.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.745
Didn't Mom feel ridiculous?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.841
That's enough,

07:12.515 --> 07:14.097
it's over.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.800
Next month I'll be doing
"Domenica ln".

07:18.521 --> 07:21.513
- Really?
- 99%.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.983
- I go to Rome for the screen test.
- Mainaghi put you there?

07:25.070 --> 07:28.608
No!
Can't I do something on my own?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.193
Sorry...

07:33.745 --> 07:35.361
I'm happy for you.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.240
Besides, the way the Wind's blowing,
Mainaghi...

07:39.459 --> 07:41.496
Mainaghi what?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.203
Chiesa was his friend,
didn't they work together?

07:48.885 --> 07:52.423
Bibi, you left it on the table,
you wanted it found.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.052
So, now you're a psychologist?
I thought you did something else!

07:56.267 --> 07:58.474
What was it? Right, dauphin...

07:58.687 --> 08:00.678
At least I do something.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.850
If they catch you,
you'll discredit the whole family.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.380
You smoke it, sniff it?
What do you do with it?

08:30.802 --> 08:33.339
I don't shoot up,
if that's what you mean.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.052
I tried it too, a long time ago,

08:38.934 --> 08:40.299
in Nepal.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.115
What can I tell you?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.819
You wouldn't listen anyway.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.795
You're like me.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.626
<i>Leave a message, I'm not home.</i>

09:15.055 --> 09:17.843
<i>Luca, pick up the phone, c'mon!</i>

09:19.059 --> 09:21.847
<i>I'm a little down today,
maybe because it's Sunday.</i>

09:23.855 --> 09:27.018
I think Sunday's a stupid day,

09:28.068 --> 09:30.275
it reminds me
of waking up in the hospital.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.858
<i>The evening before,
no one realized I wasn't well,</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:37.863
<i>my brother had gone out,
my folks were at the theater...</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:41.287
<i>actually no,
you know what my father did?</i>

09:41.456 --> 09:43.447
He came back

09:44.042 --> 09:48.036
and said: "Why don't you go out?
Go have some fun!"

09:48.838 --> 09:51.045
And he gave me 100,000 Iiras.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.046
You know what I did after that?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.046
I slit my wrists.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.840
<i>Our waiter saved me.</i>

10:04.646 --> 10:06.853
<i>Anyway, the other night...</i>

10:07.899 --> 10:10.061
it's weird, I know,

10:10.276 --> 10:12.859
but I felt that, without knowing me,

10:14.072 --> 10:16.279
you knew a lot about me.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.068
You'd have realized.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.598
You have to come to the school,

10:43.810 --> 10:47.348
it's Parents Week,
you're the only one who's never come.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.269
No, we're going to Bologna,
you have to go back to Mom.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.600
Why?

10:53.820 --> 10:56.027
She's your mother,
she wants you with her.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.655
And you don't?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.066
I have to leave for a few days.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.823
Take me with you!

11:04.038 --> 11:06.245
How? I'm going for work.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.832
I still don't understand
what your job is!

11:10.044 --> 11:11.250
Excuse me!

11:11.421 --> 11:13.503
Who do you vote for?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.126
Moana.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.917
- Why?
- I love her.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.221
That's my job.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.224
I try to understand
what people do and why.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.094
And they pay you?

11:29.314 --> 11:31.351
THE PARTY OF LOVE

11:31.608 --> 11:35.351
Limit the taxation power
of the state and the local agencies,

11:35.612 --> 11:38.195
recognize enterprise
in the constitution...

11:41.951 --> 11:43.157
What's the matter?

11:43.286 --> 11:45.744
I'll do what I want in my house
and while you're here...

11:45.872 --> 11:48.034
Okay, but I'll be leaving soon.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.203
I'll get a house four times bigger!

11:51.794 --> 11:53.034
What's so fucking funny?

11:56.841 --> 12:01.210
You're no genius, but if you think
they'll vote for you...

12:02.388 --> 12:06.302
Think I won't get into Parliament?
And if I do?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.513
You'll fuck that up too!

12:21.241 --> 12:23.232
I hate this city.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.823
Me too.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.625
Viola?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.374
She's in the car,
I didn't want her to hear.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.373
Hear what?

12:39.634 --> 12:42.046
I told her you wanted her back.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.557
What should I have said?

12:56.776 --> 12:59.313
The truth, you don't want her
around the house,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.354
so she'd stop thinking
she'd like to be with you.

13:03.533 --> 13:07.197
- She doesn't even know me!
- Right, she thinks you're wonderful.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.781
Marina,

13:09.330 --> 13:12.413
she's your daughter,
I'm no part of it, that was the deal.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.243
Too bad, it would do you good
to spend time with her.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.787
Want some?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.585
No thanks, I don't drink
anything orange.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.712
My brother either,

13:24.554 --> 13:26.545
and now he's dying of cancer.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.888
Where is he?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.682
In there.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.644
You hated your brother,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.654
you called him a "shit cop".

13:45.658 --> 13:48.616
People change, just look at you.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.227
It disturbs you to see me like this?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.643
Yes.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.652
I was always a little scared of you.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.397
With good reason.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.197
Don't worry.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.405
I'll soon be taking your secret
to the tomb.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.498
You're free.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.337
Mr. Chiesa,
do you still feel Socialist?

14:50.598 --> 14:53.260
- People, please...
- Why did you decide to talk?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.017
- Please...
- How are you after a month in jail?

14:56.229 --> 14:59.517
- Why did you decide to talk?
- Did you involve politicians?

15:02.026 --> 15:04.233
Will you tell us
if you involved politicians?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.395
People want to know!

15:08.032 --> 15:10.023
Did you abandon your party?

15:18.709 --> 15:22.498
C'mon, Fenati, it's a table,
not Big Ben!

15:23.256 --> 15:25.372
Good grief... go!

15:25.633 --> 15:27.840
- There!
- Go slow.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.634
Go to the side!

15:30.054 --> 15:33.046
- What's going on?
- We're the von Trapp Family.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.215
Di Pietro's playing Julie Andrews.

15:36.394 --> 15:38.010
What happened to your eye?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.929
Discord between adult males.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.606
All together?

15:43.693 --> 15:47.231
The only way, they know each other,
some even have the same lawyer.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.396
Now let's see them try to concur!

15:52.034 --> 15:54.776
Gentlemen, I've prepared
the questions for you,

15:55.413 --> 15:58.405
just follow the script.
Fenati, give these out.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.620
Okay, gentlemen...

16:07.258 --> 16:10.046
I want you ready
in just a few minutes.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.214
Pastore...

16:19.270 --> 16:21.261
We swap for 50,000?

16:26.861 --> 16:29.228
Venturi, I already gave you
50,000 lire.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.646
Isn't Mainaghi worth 100,000?

16:31.824 --> 16:34.816
- Think I print the stuff?
- I know what it means to you.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.288
Oh, so bribery's not a crime.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.495
You've reinvented the wheel.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.625
I'm just doing my job.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.923
That's how the outfit keeps going.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.545
If the economy's not turning,
where's your salary come from?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.510
I didn't know
the tender was controlled.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.933
How come Mario Chiesa
gave your name?

17:01.145 --> 17:03.386
Have you ever worked
with the public in Italy?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.682
He was hounding me for money,

17:06.858 --> 17:10.318
and since I refused,
he gave my name as revenge.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.029
What people won't do for money, eh?

17:13.281 --> 17:16.069
Mario Chiesa, do you know him?

17:16.702 --> 17:18.113
Who doesn't, by now?

17:20.248 --> 17:23.411
I've run into him sometimes,
on official occasions.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.617
I believe the last time
was at a Woman's Day party,

17:26.837 --> 17:29.249
organized by the Milan PSI section.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.797
I found the whole thing very funny

17:32.051 --> 17:35.089
because the speakers were all men:
Craxi, Pillitteri...

17:35.263 --> 17:38.551
- I thought you were friends.
- Having friends isn't a crime.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.383
No, the crime is rigging contracts.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.053
We know how it works,

17:45.273 --> 17:48.686
it's a proven, automatic mechanism,

17:48.859 --> 17:51.851
no one asks, no one offers,
there's no need.

17:52.113 --> 17:55.526
Yes, it's your boss' theory...
What's it called...?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.361
"Environmental Dation".

17:59.245 --> 18:02.203
Your company won a contract
to build three new pavilions,

18:02.290 --> 18:03.826
tell me, how did the tender go?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.949
We had the best parameters
and we won.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.535
- You didn't pay a kickback?
- No.

18:14.385 --> 18:19.380
Edil Mainaghi deposited a monthly
amount equal to 5% of the contract.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.094
Meaning, you paid a kickback.

18:26.230 --> 18:30.098
Yes, that's the truth,
but I paid none.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.104
Regarding tenders,

18:33.112 --> 18:35.900
our administrator, Cosimo Corbi,
has always handled them.

18:36.157 --> 18:38.114
So, you don't know a thing.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.658
Corbi has always
managed our funds freely.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.658
- Where is he now?
- Abroad.

18:44.415 --> 18:47.032
But he's on his way back
to clarify his position.

18:47.168 --> 18:48.249
I see.

18:49.253 --> 18:52.621
Corbi will get a few years

18:53.591 --> 18:55.958
and when he gets out,
promotion and double salary.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.961
They've slung mud at me a thousand
times, but I always come out clean.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.138
You just have your back covered,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.054
you feel untouchable.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.343
- But Craxi...
- Craxi, huh?

19:07.605 --> 19:10.814
That's where you want to go, right?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.232
- What's the problem?
- None at all.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.608
Pastore, I'll finish here.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.711
Counselor, Mr. Mainaghi...

19:35.591 --> 19:39.050
<i>Interrogation of those under
investigation is now continuing.</i>

19:39.220 --> 19:41.427
<i>Michele Mainaghi's position
appears more solid,</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:45.265
<i>while for the other industrialists,
things grow worse...</i>

19:49.522 --> 19:52.105
Good evening, a Negroni, please.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.398
Don't worry, I'm not here for you.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.363
Bad day?

20:01.617 --> 20:04.609
Have you ever waited
a lot for something

20:04.787 --> 20:07.028
and when you get it, you mess it up'?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.035
There's a saying:

20:10.835 --> 20:13.623
God punishes men
by realizing their dreams.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.624
They all say the investigation
of the century starts here,

20:19.844 --> 20:22.632
we're in the right place,
at the right time.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.630
In fact, I'm being replaced.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.057
To lost chances!

20:36.652 --> 20:38.643
To lost chances.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.397
You were my last hope
to find a source.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.068
Hers too.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.063
You know I have to go.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.324
- Tell me it'll all go well.
- Of course.

21:27.828 --> 21:31.116
They have nothing on me,
I didn't do anything, don't worry.

21:33.793 --> 21:37.081
But you mean if you'll do well.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.839
Now there's the screen test,
just go there and look good.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.633
I'm scared.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.505
You've just taken off.

21:49.099 --> 21:53.684
A gust of wind can take you up,
high in the sky, with no effort,

21:53.896 --> 21:55.762
it's called an updraft.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.932
And you're about to get
one hell of one.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.234
I don't know.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.146
I'm not lucky.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.239
But I am, and as long as I'm here,
you have nothing to fear.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.905
If something happens to you?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.618
No,

22:19.046 --> 22:21.037
nothing will happen to me.

22:34.311 --> 22:36.973
- Is Bortolotti in his office?
- Yes, he's in there.

22:37.398 --> 22:39.014
Hello.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.356
Bortolotti,

22:44.613 --> 22:47.605
I don't know what to say
at the rally.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.025
I've studied...
too much stuff, can't learn it.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.948
The articles and...

22:54.206 --> 22:57.574
You could have told me
instead of being a war hero,

22:57.793 --> 23:01.377
you're just a jerk who got sent home
with a kick in the ass.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.504
Look here.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.213
THE TRUE STORY OF "BATMAN"

23:08.387 --> 23:11.630
Hell broke loose,
they're all pissed off.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.843
"Who the fuck is he? He's not
one of us! Why did we put him up?"

23:18.230 --> 23:20.642
What changes for you?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.818
I'm still the guy who kicked the shit
out of the Albanians, right?

23:27.406 --> 23:31.400
You had a chance, as long as
you were a hero for the papers,

23:31.660 --> 23:34.618
but now that they've screwed you...

23:34.830 --> 23:38.243
I'll tell these guys
how it really went in Iraq.

23:38.834 --> 23:41.622
Screwed... no way dishonored!

23:44.715 --> 23:47.332
Calm down, forget it,

23:47.593 --> 23:50.051
by now the damage is done.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.212
What damage?

23:53.390 --> 23:56.303
You'll get stuck
at the bottom of the list.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.638
Why?

23:59.772 --> 24:03.015
C'mon, take a positive attitude,

24:03.233 --> 24:06.021
you're saved from the rally.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.243
Keep getting drunk
like a teenager, good for you!

24:25.839 --> 24:27.830
You have the exclusive?

24:30.260 --> 24:32.376
I won't be in Parliament anymore,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.049
happy?

24:34.223 --> 24:36.055
What happened?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.182
I've been screwed.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.228
Why doesn't anything go right for me?

24:42.856 --> 24:44.312
Why the fuck not?

24:49.321 --> 24:52.029
It's important to keep
the Left from governing.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.689
Quiet, they're all around.

24:54.410 --> 24:58.028
We've seen lots of investigations,
justice must run its course.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.329
- Why are we here?
- Martinazzoli's coming.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.047
- Hello?
- The hotel's nice.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.964
- You're here?
- How are things?

25:14.179 --> 25:16.637
- What a bore.
- If you're bored, come here.

25:17.391 --> 25:18.927
I'm on my way.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.384
Shit, Buio, it's you!

25:22.021 --> 25:23.682
Sorry, I have to go.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.433
Don't you recognize me?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.390
Beppe!

25:27.651 --> 25:28.857
Shit, Beppe!

25:31.030 --> 25:33.818
Politics is done
in places like this now.

25:34.408 --> 25:37.241
Actually, let me do some promoting.

25:38.620 --> 25:40.702
PDS? You?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.576
It's quite a leap from Workers' Power!
Nice photo.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.243
Remember the Coca Buton at Pierino's,

25:47.379 --> 25:50.041
the nights in Via Marsili,
the assemblies in room 3?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.840
Then, at one point,
you disappeared from Bologna.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.590
- I changed my life.
- I see that!

25:56.805 --> 25:58.796
How much was that suit?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.345
I did proletarian shopping at Armani.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.801
What are you doing here?

26:04.021 --> 26:06.012
I'm with him.

26:07.232 --> 26:10.020
- He's DC, isn't he?
- Yes.

26:11.236 --> 26:14.399
Shit, Leo Notte,
a Christian Democrat lackey!

26:14.656 --> 26:17.648
No, it's more complex than that.

26:18.243 --> 26:20.701
I'm an advisor with Publitalia.

26:20.913 --> 26:25.032
Berlusconi!
"Power to lmagination", no!

26:25.209 --> 26:28.372
As Flaiano said:
"When you give up a dream,

26:28.587 --> 26:31.295
all you can do
is masturbate with reality."

26:32.382 --> 26:35.500
C'mon, don't be offended,

26:35.719 --> 26:37.801
we've both become bourgeois.

26:39.973 --> 26:43.762
What the fuck do you want?
You're the bourgeois!

26:48.023 --> 26:52.233
Did you read the agenda? Tomorrow
we see category representatives.

26:52.402 --> 26:54.393
I'm going back to Milan.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.833
Shit, my ankle!

27:17.886 --> 27:20.878
- We'll go to the hospital.
- My screen test's tomorrow!

27:21.098 --> 27:23.260
I can't have broken it.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.341
If you move it, it's not broken.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.059
Can I still dance, Doctor?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.191
Want a diagnosis?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.319
Self-sabotage.

27:42.077 --> 27:45.069
You know your goal,
you know it will make you feel better

27:45.289 --> 27:47.280
and you work hard not to reach it.

27:47.499 --> 27:50.457
You say I don't want to do
"Domenica ln"? You're joking, right?

27:50.711 --> 27:52.918
I say your subconscious is scared,

27:53.380 --> 27:55.587
it doesn't want change,
and lives it as danger.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.633
Anyway.

28:00.846 --> 28:03.053
I have no subconscious.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.532
<i>Now I see why
you got yourself transferred there.</i>

28:54.441 --> 28:56.023
Olivieri!

28:59.446 --> 29:01.232
Who are you?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.237
Don't worry, we're the good guys.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.289
Police.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.959
- How do I know that?
- A little trust, okay?

29:15.545 --> 29:19.038
You question your clients when
they give you money for Switzerland?

29:19.258 --> 29:21.420
I want my lawyer.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.256
Maybe he's asleep at this hour.

29:26.807 --> 29:30.050
There's enough evidence here
to put you away for 5 or 6 years.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.675
What's that mean?

29:31.895 --> 29:35.263
But the one I'm looking for
isn't here: Mainaghi.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.389
I don't know him.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.692
- You don't?
- No.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.733
Then why is your name
among his papers?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.320
Stop!

29:48.704 --> 29:50.411
Shit...

29:51.248 --> 29:53.455
We're off to a bad start!

29:55.043 --> 29:59.037
Now do everything I say
or it'll end up worse, okay?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.651
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.158
You must be Viola's father.

30:37.044 --> 30:40.628
I know all the other parents,
I went by elimination.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.623
- A pleasure, Matilde.
- My pleasure.

30:44.259 --> 30:47.627
- Viola's here?
- Yes, the 8th is down there.

30:49.056 --> 30:50.842
The 8th?

30:51.058 --> 30:53.220
It's like the
third year of middle school.

30:56.229 --> 30:59.221
You know what they say
in the TV field?

30:59.358 --> 31:02.271
TV viewers are like kids
in the third year of middle school,

31:02.361 --> 31:05.023
not notably gifted,
sitting at the back desks.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.692
We're against television.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.277
Of course.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.699
Doesn't Berlusconi
send his daughters here?

31:15.123 --> 31:18.115
You should do something
before you go in.

31:19.419 --> 31:21.831
We believe the constraint of the foot

31:22.047 --> 31:24.630
is harmful to body energy.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.708
How about those?

31:35.435 --> 31:38.427
- Boys and girls...
- Hello.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.850
Hello.

31:44.903 --> 31:48.316
We'll steal a few minutes
from our geography lesson.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.783
Well?

31:53.036 --> 31:55.494
- What's all this?
- I don't want to stay there.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.330
How did you get into the house?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.707
I kept a copy of the keys.

32:02.045 --> 32:05.629
Mr. Notte,
you should speak to the whole class.

32:06.216 --> 32:09.880
Me? No, I came to speak to Viola.

32:10.095 --> 32:12.257
Let's take advantage,
this is Parents' Week.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.633
We'll talk about it later.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.556
Please, come up here.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.815
Tell me how it works,
because I didn't do my homework.

32:33.034 --> 32:35.617
But you don't believe in homework,
do you?

32:35.871 --> 32:39.660
Every parent taught the class
a manual activity.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.867
Lisa's father taught us gardening,

32:43.086 --> 32:45.874
Filippo's, how to build a table.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.422
A table?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.762
Do you have paper?

32:55.432 --> 32:57.218
- Of course.
- Fine.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.636
Today I'll teach you
how to do a market survey.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.646
It's not manual,
more like pencils and 'x's,

33:04.858 --> 33:06.724
but we believe in pencils, right?

33:08.737 --> 33:10.023
Thank you.

33:10.197 --> 33:12.404
Each of you must write

33:12.616 --> 33:14.482
the ten public figures you love most:

33:14.701 --> 33:17.318
sports, culture, theater, politics,

33:17.537 --> 33:19.528
whatever you want.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.364
Pass these around, please.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.792
No names, you don't have
to impress anyone,

33:25.045 --> 33:27.036
just be truthful.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.288
Is that clear?

33:29.466 --> 33:32.254
Fine, I'll go smoke,

33:32.677 --> 33:34.463
see you in a while.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.841
That way.

33:37.057 --> 33:40.049
Ladies and Gentlemen,
good afternoon...

33:40.435 --> 33:42.221
Excuse me, I'll do it again.

33:43.647 --> 33:47.015
Ladies and Gentlemen, good afternoon
and welcome to studio 5.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.271
My name's Veronica Castello
and I'll be with you,

33:50.362 --> 33:53.650
together with Pippo Baudo,
for the Sunday afternoons of Rai Uno.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.444
Right profile.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.032
Left profile.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.620
That's enough.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.913
I can do it again, if you like.

34:11.132 --> 34:14.215
No, just fine, thank you for coming.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.172
- It's over?
- Yes.

34:17.347 --> 34:20.339
- I don't have to dance?
- Dance, if you really want to.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.429
- I can't right now.
- Okay then, that's all.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.013
I hurt my ankle,

34:27.232 --> 34:30.440
but there are many other things
I can do, better than dancing.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.402
And I assure you I dance very well.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.699
There's no need, you've been hired.

34:49.129 --> 34:51.917
You already screwed
the guy you were supposed to.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.059
A battle for man's freedom,

35:06.438 --> 35:09.647
that's what the League is doing!

35:15.238 --> 35:17.445
I want to show you

35:17.657 --> 35:19.819
the faces of our people...

35:20.035 --> 35:22.618
- What are you doing here?
- I want to speak too.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.821
- No, you're not on the program.
- Am I a candidate or not?

35:26.041 --> 35:27.122
Yes.

35:27.334 --> 35:30.793
My only chance to get votes
is here tonight, right?

35:31.046 --> 35:33.583
- You can't talk.
- Why not?

35:33.757 --> 35:36.294
- You've already done enough damage.
- What damage?

35:36.426 --> 35:38.212
- Just stay calm.
- What damage?

35:38.261 --> 35:41.344
- I have to speak, you stay calm!
- What the fuck am I doing here?

35:41.431 --> 35:44.344
- Quiet!
- Why the fuck did you want me?

35:44.601 --> 35:46.057
Gianni Bortolotti!

35:46.186 --> 35:48.177
What are you doing?

35:48.396 --> 35:52.390
I'm Pietro Bosco.
Where do I speak? I'll speak here.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.400
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

35:55.612 --> 35:58.024
I don't know what he'll say!

35:58.239 --> 36:00.025
First point...

36:02.535 --> 36:04.902
- Go, Bosco!
- Talk!

36:11.419 --> 36:13.410
Show us your balls!

36:15.882 --> 36:17.748
C'mon, talk!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.376
I have fuck-all to say.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.802
I have fuck-all to say.

36:23.431 --> 36:27.220
My whole life they've said
I have fuck-all to say,

36:28.019 --> 36:31.228
that I should shut up, I'm worthless.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.522
Then you find out

36:40.407 --> 36:43.490
the ones telling you
you're not worth crap

36:43.660 --> 36:45.947
are the ones
who let everything go to shit,

36:46.162 --> 36:49.530
who reduced the country to this,
fuck 'em.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.417
No more orders!

36:54.629 --> 36:57.621
No more letting them
push us around, fuck 'em!

36:57.841 --> 37:00.708
Now it's our turn,
the worthless ones!

37:01.428 --> 37:04.841
Let's go take back this country,
fuck 'em!

37:05.056 --> 37:08.640
We'll send them all home,
once and for all,

37:08.852 --> 37:10.934
go home, get out, fuck 'em!

37:13.648 --> 37:18.017
Vote for Pietro Bosco, our Batman!

37:23.700 --> 37:26.112
APRIL 5th

38:18.797 --> 38:20.788
Who won?

38:29.432 --> 38:31.639
I don't want to go back there.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.436
I want to stay with you,
I swear I won't be a bother.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.657
Can you tell which one's mine?

38:50.036 --> 38:52.243
They're anonymous, how could I?

39:01.464 --> 39:03.671
MY FATHER...

39:07.846 --> 39:09.837
You cheated,

39:10.056 --> 39:12.423
we said only public figures.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.613
<i>The fact that...</i>

39:36.833 --> 39:39.040
<i>I also noticed</i>

39:39.252 --> 39:42.495
<i>that this victory is not considered</i>

39:42.714 --> 39:45.581
<i>as just a sports victory,
although certainly exalting,</i>

39:45.800 --> 39:48.212
<i>but as the victory</i>

39:48.845 --> 39:51.837
<i>of a certain system of values,
of a certain philosophy,</i>

39:52.056 --> 39:54.218
<i>all this pleased me very much,</i>

39:54.434 --> 39:57.017
<i>because I'm the first
to practice this philosophy</i>

39:57.228 --> 40:01.438
<i>and try to enthuse others
in this direction.</i>

40:01.649 --> 40:03.640
<i>I believe this philosophy</i>

40:03.860 --> 40:06.648
<i>is a very simple thing.</i>

40:06.821 --> 40:09.904
<i>In any case, there was the ambition</i>

40:10.116 --> 40:13.029
<i>to establish certain important goals.</i>

40:13.202 --> 40:15.864
<i>This victory is also
fruit of the organization</i>

40:16.080 --> 40:18.663
<i>and constant work...</i>

40:20.585 --> 40:22.201
Pellegrini?

40:22.837 --> 40:24.623
Hi, Leonardo Notte.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.295
Listen, I made a survey
in my daughter's class

40:29.427 --> 40:32.465
and the result surprised me,
I'd like to enlarge the sample.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.089
The ten most-loved public figures:

40:35.266 --> 40:37.678
sports, culture, theater, society,
all together.

40:37.894 --> 40:40.352
The 9-13 year segment,
across the board.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.226
Bosco, you're here!

40:49.656 --> 40:51.112
Well?

41:01.459 --> 41:03.416
Was I elected or not?

41:03.628 --> 41:06.040
You still don't understand?

41:18.685 --> 41:20.767
You did it, you did it!

41:20.979 --> 41:22.970
I did it, goddamn!

41:23.147 --> 41:24.763
Wow!

41:29.779 --> 41:33.738
<i>The Democratic Party
of the Left, 103,</i>

41:33.950 --> 41:38.035
<i>74 less compared to
what the Communist Party had...</i>

41:38.246 --> 41:40.829
Sir, do we proceed with the arrests?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.948
<i>Green Party, 16 + 3,</i>

41:43.167 --> 41:45.408
<i>Northern League, 56 + 55,</i>

41:45.628 --> 41:47.118
<i>other leagues, 9,</i>

41:47.338 --> 41:50.797
<i>Pannella List, 7,
The Network, 12 seats,</i>

41:51.050 --> 41:54.042
<i>Referendum list, no seat,
others, 5 seats,</i>

41:54.220 --> 41:56.427
<i>22 less, compared...</i>

41:57.140 --> 41:59.802
We have confirmation
on all the industrialists.

42:00.059 --> 42:02.175
Only Mainaghi's missing.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.846
Look what came into
the Prosecutor's office today.

42:10.153 --> 42:13.566
It seems that Mainaghi sent bank
transfers for Levissima and Fiuggi,

42:13.698 --> 42:15.234
Mario Chiesa's accounts.

42:15.408 --> 42:17.399
Who gave us this gift?

42:17.785 --> 42:21.403
Anonymous source, maybe Mainaghi
made one enemy too many.

42:27.253 --> 42:30.245
Want a little champagne?
Go confirm it!

42:32.633 --> 42:35.045
Discord between adult males, too?

42:37.638 --> 42:39.424
Hello, it's Di Pietro.

42:40.058 --> 42:43.596
APRIL 22nd

42:50.234 --> 42:52.020
Will you buy me another?

42:52.445 --> 42:54.231
What do you know?

42:54.822 --> 42:56.654
Nothing, why?

42:56.824 --> 43:00.442
I don't care who passed the information,
just what you know.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.666
You're arresting those eight
industrialists, can you confirm?

43:08.878 --> 43:10.744
There are nine arrests.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.836
You're the only one who knows this.

43:22.225 --> 43:23.841
Wake up!

43:25.603 --> 43:27.594
You're an idiot, what are you doing?

43:27.814 --> 43:30.021
I'm leaving,
I'm getting off your balls,

43:30.191 --> 43:32.023
I'm going to Rome.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.442
Happy?

43:34.654 --> 43:36.236
Are you happy now or not?

43:37.949 --> 43:40.816
It was me who gave
the news to the papers.

43:46.833 --> 43:50.042
I already lost a son,
I didn't want to lose you too.

43:55.842 --> 43:57.628
It's too late.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.477
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.982
ARREST WARRANT

44:30.626 --> 44:33.038
You are under arrest for graft.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.415
Take him away.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.037
Bye.

45:46.661 --> 45:49.619
MAINAGHI ARRESTED

45:49.747 --> 45:51.909
POLITICIANS CHARGED

46:29.120 --> 46:30.781
Dad?

46:36.127 --> 46:37.333
Hi.

46:40.965 --> 46:43.753
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO HER,
MURDERER

47:02.361 --> 47:03.943
NEXT TIME

47:04.030 --> 47:06.692
Di Pietro! Di Pietro!

47:10.745 --> 47:13.578
- I can't talk to you.
- Fuck off.

47:29.305 --> 47:30.545
Wow!

47:34.643 --> 47:38.511
- Look this way! One more!
- Smile...
