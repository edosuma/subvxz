00:49.628 --> 00:53.765
Listen, kid, I been around
a few Christmases.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.800
- It's true.
- No way.

00:55.802 --> 00:57.035
I swear on my life.

00:57.037 --> 00:59.771
- All nine of them?
- Yes.

01:02.574 --> 01:05.510
Now quiet.
Here he comes.

01:10.785 --> 01:12.117
Wow.

01:12.119 --> 01:14.887
Magical, right?

01:14.889 --> 01:17.656
Where's his claws?

01:17.658 --> 01:19.158
He--He's so fat.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.161
It's his jolliness, Rigby.

01:22.163 --> 01:23.929
That's why he's so big.

01:23.931 --> 01:25.464
Oh!

01:26.933 --> 01:30.969
Is that the record Julia wants?
How did he know?

01:30.971 --> 01:34.173
He is Santa, Rigby.

01:34.175 --> 01:36.409
He knows.

01:36.677 --> 01:39.345
Hey, I'm gonna tell
Santa what I want.

01:39.347 --> 01:42.115
Hey, hey, kid,
where are you going?

01:42.117 --> 01:43.883
I want to say hi
to Santa.

01:43.885 --> 01:45.852
No, you can't.
Santa's allergic to cats.

01:47.656 --> 01:50.156
Well, hello there.
Who are you?

01:50.158 --> 01:51.724
Hi, Santa.
I'm Rigby.

01:51.726 --> 01:52.992
Shoo, shoo. Go away.

01:52.994 --> 01:56.096
I'd love to pet you,
but I better not.

01:56.098 --> 01:58.731
I... Hello!

02:00.001 --> 02:02.302
Eww. Gross.

02:07.243 --> 02:08.642
Excuse me, Santa.

02:08.644 --> 02:10.110
Go away.

02:10.113 --> 02:11.278
Shoo!

02:12.982 --> 02:15.249
Oh, you made him
sneeze again.

02:15.251 --> 02:17.084
Go away.

02:21.690 --> 02:23.858
Cookies.

02:23.860 --> 02:27.228
Ah, cookies.

02:28.096 --> 02:29.997
Rigby, get back here!

02:35.972 --> 02:37.772
Hello?

02:37.774 --> 02:39.541
Is someone there?

02:47.150 --> 02:49.618
A cat!
Whoa! Chill out, dude.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.354
Oh, no!
Julia's record!

02:52.356 --> 02:54.756
See, kid?
I told you.

02:54.758 --> 02:57.025
He's allergic to cats.

03:05.135 --> 03:05.801
Santa?

03:05.803 --> 03:08.571
Oh,
I can't let her see me!

03:09.907 --> 03:11.474
Santa, wait!

03:24.122 --> 03:25.755
- Santa!
- Cats!

03:41.172 --> 03:46.710
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

03:46.712 --> 03:48.245
Dang it.

04:06.865 --> 04:09.400
Mom,
pop the trunk.

04:24.483 --> 04:25.516
Mom.

04:25.518 --> 04:27.018
Nathan has
a tree.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.620
Tommy, please.

04:29.555 --> 04:33.258
But, Mom, everyone
else has a tree.

04:33.260 --> 04:36.295
Tommy, we talked
about this. Inside.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.768
Hmm?

04:48.708 --> 04:51.310
Little dusty.

04:58.418 --> 04:59.818
Kittens, I'm home.

04:59.820 --> 05:01.987
Hey, Tommy's home.

05:17.004 --> 05:18.171
Heh. No.

05:18.173 --> 05:21.007
No, I'm not gonna
go talk to her.

05:21.009 --> 05:23.043
You go talk to her.

05:23.678 --> 05:26.179
I don't know what to say.
You're Santa.

05:26.181 --> 05:29.115
You're the one who
knows all this stuff.

05:43.865 --> 05:44.932
Tommy!

05:44.934 --> 05:47.034
Don't forget
to shut the door,

05:47.036 --> 05:48.803
or the kittens'll
get out!

05:48.805 --> 05:49.904
Get out? She's crazy.

05:49.906 --> 05:52.373
Why would we want
to get out?

05:57.245 --> 05:59.880
Hey, guys. I missed you.

06:02.351 --> 06:05.554
And put the milk away,
or it'll go bad!

06:05.556 --> 06:07.255
Okay, Mom!

06:07.557 --> 06:09.958
Did someone say Milk?

06:13.330 --> 06:14.896
I've been
starving all day.

06:14.898 --> 06:17.666
Oh, no. Here she comes.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.874
Oh,
this tastes so good.

06:30.847 --> 06:34.217
Mom, it's Christmas Eve.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.885
Tommy.

06:35.887 --> 06:38.187
We don't even need
to get a big one.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.056
We've already
discussed this.

06:40.058 --> 06:41.257
Christmas is
just something

06:41.259 --> 06:43.492
marketed by companies to sell toys

06:43.494 --> 06:45.998
and other items they have too
many of at the end of the year.

06:46.033 --> 06:49.899
Here comes another
sermon. I'm out of here.

06:51.135 --> 06:52.769
I remember.

06:52.771 --> 06:55.104
You know I love you
very much, right?

06:55.106 --> 06:57.907
And that's why
I'm not gonna lie to you

06:57.909 --> 06:59.275
and tell you
Santa's real.

06:59.277 --> 07:01.544
He was made up
by a soda company.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.914
You have to learn
to be self-sufficient,

07:03.916 --> 07:07.718
not rely on someone to bring
you the things that you want.

07:10.188 --> 07:11.321
Okay?

07:11.323 --> 07:13.056
Hey, where'd
you guys go?

07:13.058 --> 07:15.225
That's why when
you do your chores,

07:15.227 --> 07:16.160
you get an allowance,

07:16.162 --> 07:18.295
so you can buy
the things that you want.

07:18.297 --> 07:20.898
Trust me.
When you get older,

07:20.900 --> 07:23.567
no one's gonna
hand 'em to you.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.568
I know.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.869
I love you very much.

07:25.871 --> 07:27.104
I love you,
too, Mom.

07:27.106 --> 07:31.675
Hmm. Those little rascals
didn't leave any food for me.

07:31.677 --> 07:32.877
Let's make a deal.

07:32.879 --> 07:36.648
I will finish putting away
the groceries,

07:36.650 --> 07:38.283
and I'll post
my new article,

07:38.285 --> 07:40.251
and then you can do
your chores.

07:40.253 --> 07:42.587
Dust the living room,
water the plants,

07:42.589 --> 07:45.190
and then we go
to dinner. Deal?

07:45.192 --> 07:47.058
Deal.

07:51.997 --> 07:54.399
Are yours
this much trouble?

07:54.401 --> 07:56.301
You have no idea.

07:56.303 --> 07:58.336
Ah, I'm bored.

07:58.938 --> 08:01.339
We better
not go anywhere.

08:01.341 --> 08:03.275
It's almost nap time.

08:18.658 --> 08:22.361
- Quick Get it!
- But it's almost nap time.

08:22.363 --> 08:23.696
- Oh, lighten up.

08:23.698 --> 08:27.734
Ha ha ha! You paper towels thought
you could escape me!  Never!

08:27.736 --> 08:29.668
You're right!
This is fun!

08:29.670 --> 08:35.241
- Quick! Don't let it run away.
- I got it!
- You're through paper towel.

08:35.344 --> 08:37.376
Whoo-Hoo!

08:37.379 --> 08:40.581
We gotta make sure it never
escapes again!

08:40.582 --> 08:42.182
That's it guys!

08:42.183 --> 08:43.950
Nice job, Mittens!

08:43.952 --> 08:45.752
This feels great on my claws!

08:45.854 --> 08:49.756
- Ah! It keeps falling on me.
- Uh oh! It's still escaping over here.

08:49.758 --> 08:53.960
- I'm on it!
- Hey! tear it apart.
- You're mine paper towel.

08:54.062 --> 08:59.099
- Whee!
- Look guys, it's almost like we
have snow in the house now.

08:59.101 --> 09:02.370
Oh quick! Grab it guys.

09:06.809 --> 09:09.977
Not cool, guys.

09:13.515 --> 09:15.716
How's it going?

09:17.753 --> 09:19.987
What happened?

09:19.989 --> 09:20.755
The kittens.

09:20.757 --> 09:24.225
It doesn't matter.
Just clean it up.

09:24.227 --> 09:27.162
They'll be out
of our hair soon enough.

09:39.409 --> 09:42.544
Kittens,
what did you do?

09:42.779 --> 09:45.213
Uh, we may have
gotten carried away.

09:45.215 --> 09:46.582
I tried
to tell them, Mom,

09:46.584 --> 09:47.783
but they
wouldn't listen.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.084
Oh, yeah?
You weren't the one

09:49.086 --> 09:50.786
I saw leaping
through the air?

09:50.788 --> 09:52.621
Shut up, Hairball!
Enough!

09:52.623 --> 09:54.623
Kittens, you know
Tommy and Julia

09:54.625 --> 09:56.325
can't always do
everything for us.

09:56.327 --> 09:58.060
If we can't show them that we can

09:58.062 --> 09:59.829
take care of ourselves,
they'll...

09:59.831 --> 10:01.631
They'll what?

10:02.868 --> 10:05.234
They'll give you
a new home.

10:05.236 --> 10:07.370
A new home? No!

10:07.372 --> 10:09.572
They can't do that!

10:09.574 --> 10:12.623
Yes, they can.
Listen to me when I say...

10:12.658 --> 10:14.277
we need to take care of ourselves.

10:14.279 --> 10:18.348
I picked a heck of a week to quit
coughing up hair balls.

10:37.302 --> 10:39.603
Hmm, I'm hungry.

10:40.271 --> 10:43.707
Did somebody
say food?

10:46.311 --> 10:46.844
Tommy?

10:46.846 --> 10:48.946
Always thinking
with your stomach.

10:48.948 --> 10:53.117
Can you change that,
please?

11:01.093 --> 11:02.693
Do you think Tommy
will put out some food?

11:02.795 --> 11:05.397
No, Mittens.  Mom says we
need to take care of ourselves.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.532
I say we find
our own food.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.234
No more loafing.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.103
Huh? No more what?

11:16.809 --> 11:18.543
Tommy!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.480
Come on, Hairball.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.648
Let's get that food.

11:23.650 --> 11:24.816
Ah, you know
I would,

11:24.818 --> 11:26.418
but it's
a little high,

11:26.420 --> 11:27.452
and nine lives
is short

11:27.454 --> 11:29.020
if you really
think about it.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.188
Fine. I'll go myself.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.793
Just try not to land
on your head if you fall.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.632
Whoa, cramp!

11:39.634 --> 11:40.833
Be careful, Patches!

11:40.835 --> 11:42.535
Uh-oh.
Here it goes.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.370
- Whoa, oh, oh!
- Oh, no!

11:44.372 --> 11:47.373
Heads up!
Incoming!

11:51.378 --> 11:52.611
Tommy!

11:52.613 --> 11:54.013
Bail!

11:54.015 --> 11:55.147
Let's get
out of here!

11:55.149 --> 11:56.449
Sorry, Patches.

11:56.451 --> 11:58.451
Oh, no.

11:58.453 --> 12:00.219
I just mopped
in here yesterday.

12:00.221 --> 12:02.956
Now I'm gonna have
to do it again.

12:02.958 --> 12:03.957
I'll help you clean up.

12:03.959 --> 12:07.027
No. You go outside,
and water the plants.

12:07.029 --> 12:07.994
I will clean up.

12:07.996 --> 12:09.830
They probably
didn't mean it.

12:09.832 --> 12:11.498
I'm sure
they were just hungry.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.135
I'm sure.
Outside, please.

12:18.073 --> 12:21.808
And don't forget
to close the door!

12:23.644 --> 12:24.711
"Tommy, do this.

12:24.713 --> 12:25.679
Tommy, do that."

12:25.681 --> 12:29.149
Why can't you do
something for a change?

12:54.009 --> 12:57.411
Guys, I feel sorry
for Tommy.

12:57.413 --> 12:59.013
Way to go, Patches!

12:59.015 --> 13:01.016
Hey, it's not
my fault, Mittens.

13:01.018 --> 13:03.285
It's always
your fault.

13:03.287 --> 13:05.020
Shh! Listen!

13:05.022 --> 13:07.956
What is that?

13:07.958 --> 13:09.258
Oh...

13:11.327 --> 13:12.694
My...

13:14.798 --> 13:15.664
Gosh!

13:15.666 --> 13:18.000
I thought
you two broke it.

13:18.002 --> 13:19.401
We did!

13:19.403 --> 13:20.903
Yet there it is!

13:20.905 --> 13:23.639
It's impossible!
It's horrible!

13:23.641 --> 13:25.574
It's the Devil!

13:31.316 --> 13:33.383
- Run!
- Run!

13:33.385 --> 13:35.285
It'll eat us all
in one bite!

13:35.287 --> 13:36.152
Gotta go! Gotta go!

13:36.154 --> 13:38.521
We gotta get out of here!
Go! Go! Go!

13:38.523 --> 13:41.224
Right behind you, guys.

13:41.226 --> 13:42.892
Hello, tail.

13:42.894 --> 13:45.795
- Don't look back!
- Patches, slow down!

13:45.797 --> 13:49.566
<i>- Wait!
- It's still coming for us!</i>

13:49.568 --> 13:52.535
Gotta go.
Gotta go. Gotta go!

13:55.139 --> 13:56.739
No, no, no, no, no, no!

13:56.741 --> 13:58.641
Patches, look out!

13:58.643 --> 14:02.112
Ouch!
Timber!

14:02.114 --> 14:06.150
No. Oh, no!

14:11.890 --> 14:17.061
Tommy, how about we try to
keep the kittens off my lawn?

14:17.063 --> 14:20.798
And that's my cue
to leave.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.600
Okay, buddy?

14:22.602 --> 14:24.034
Okay.

14:27.006 --> 14:30.775
Sorry, Mr. Bramble.
I'll help.

14:30.777 --> 14:32.878
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's okay.

14:32.880 --> 14:36.248
Now, Tommy,
I'm gonna level with you.

14:36.250 --> 14:40.886
These Santas have been
in my family for generations.

14:40.888 --> 14:42.821
Creepy.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.223
It's not creepy.

14:45.225 --> 14:48.360
It's a tribute to the true
meaning of Christmas.

14:48.362 --> 14:53.798
Sad. I have to tell a grown-up
that Santa isn't real.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.867
Of course he is.

14:55.869 --> 14:57.969
It's okay,
Mr. Bramble.

14:57.971 --> 14:59.604
You don't
have to lie to me.

14:59.606 --> 15:02.208
My Mom already
told me the truth.

15:02.210 --> 15:04.343
She did?

15:04.645 --> 15:06.679
Well, if you'll
excuse me, Tommy,

15:06.681 --> 15:10.583
uh, I'm gonna have to find
myself some superglue, so...

15:10.585 --> 15:13.252
Santas, hang out for a bit.

15:25.065 --> 15:30.137
This chair is boring.
Let's go somewhere else.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.776
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

15:35.778 --> 15:37.577
No, not the chair.

15:37.579 --> 15:39.246
We'll die of boredom.

15:39.248 --> 15:41.348
Don't be so melodramatic,
Hairball.

15:41.350 --> 15:45.252
- Hey watch the fur!
- Let me go!

15:45.254 --> 15:46.486
No, no, no,

15:46.488 --> 15:48.155
or you're gonna
get in trouble.

15:48.157 --> 15:49.790
Hey, Trouble's my middle name.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.558
Haha, you can't
get us.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.527
Try and catch us now.

15:53.529 --> 15:54.828
Hey, watch that fur.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.797
Yeah, Mom just gave us
a bath.

15:56.799 --> 16:00.601
- Judge Tommy?
- Yeah, since when does he hate fun?

16:01.972 --> 16:04.138
Tommy, can you get
the door, please?

16:10.446 --> 16:12.847
Hi, Tommy.

16:12.849 --> 16:14.916
Is your mom here?

16:16.518 --> 16:20.788
Look, I'm sorry if I was
short with you earlier.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.523
It's just those Santas,

16:22.525 --> 16:24.926
they're very special
to me.

16:24.928 --> 16:27.261
It's okay, Mr. Bramble.

16:27.263 --> 16:28.429
Your childhood delusions

16:28.431 --> 16:32.368
are causing you to revert
back to a childlike state.

16:32.370 --> 16:34.737
Heh heh.
Who said that?

16:34.739 --> 16:37.773
Mom. She writes about it
in her blog.

16:37.775 --> 16:41.143
Yeah, I know.

16:44.381 --> 16:47.850
Is she around,
by any chance?

16:47.852 --> 16:52.654
Mom! Mr. Bramble's here!

16:52.656 --> 16:54.423
Hmm.

17:02.099 --> 17:04.166
Hey!

17:04.169 --> 17:05.835
Macaroni and cheese?

17:05.837 --> 17:08.171
Oh. You cooked.

17:08.173 --> 17:09.672
Oh, actually,
I also came over

17:09.674 --> 17:12.474
because I wanted to see
if you had any superglue.

17:12.477 --> 17:16.980
See, one of my Santas
fell outside,

17:16.982 --> 17:19.749
and I want to fix it
before tonight.

17:19.751 --> 17:22.819
All the stores
are closed.

17:23.621 --> 17:25.088
Why by tonight?

17:25.089 --> 17:27.824
Well...

17:29.728 --> 17:32.396
so Santa can see them.

17:34.199 --> 17:35.633
Okay.

17:42.641 --> 17:44.341
There you go.

17:44.343 --> 17:47.478
Uh... thank you.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.014
You're welcome.

17:50.016 --> 17:51.248
Yeah.

17:52.350 --> 17:55.019
Well, actually,
if you guys

17:55.021 --> 17:56.520
aren't doing anything
tomorrow night

17:56.522 --> 17:58.656
and you wanted to
come over for dinner,

17:58.658 --> 18:01.226
you're more than welcome
to stop by and...

18:01.228 --> 18:02.861
Marcus, thank you,

18:02.863 --> 18:04.763
but Tommy and I
will be busy

18:04.765 --> 18:06.832
settling everything
for the kittens' adoptions.

18:06.834 --> 18:09.568
<i>Bramble?  What is
he doing here?</i>

18:09.570 --> 18:11.503
<i>It smells
like poo!</i>

18:11.705 --> 18:12.705
We would have done it sooner

18:12.707 --> 18:14.707
but everything's closed
for the holidays.

18:14.709 --> 18:16.341
<i>Smells like you, Patches.</i>

18:16.343 --> 18:18.977
<i>Geez, you roll in
fertilizer one time...</i>

18:18.979 --> 18:21.479
Well, let me know if you change your
mind about dinner tomorrow night.

18:21.514 --> 18:23.348
<i>Hey! Where you
going with that shoe.</i>

18:23.383 --> 18:25.767
<i>- These shoes really stink!
- No Mary, it ain't.</i>

18:25.768 --> 18:26.915
<i>Wait! Where's he going?</i>

18:26.987 --> 18:28.086
<i>Hey!  Get back here!</i>

18:28.088 --> 18:30.156
<i>Look out!</i>

18:30.158 --> 18:31.457
Ahh!

18:31.459 --> 18:34.393
<i>- Timber!
- Bullseye!</i>

18:34.395 --> 18:36.028
Oh, my gosh!

18:36.030 --> 18:37.730
I am so sorry.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.234
I'm fine.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.970
I'm fine.

18:44.071 --> 18:47.039
You got
something on your face.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.207
Yucky.

18:48.209 --> 18:49.008
I'm fine.

18:49.010 --> 18:52.512
Better luck
next time, Bramble.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.119
Tommy, we need to talk
about the cats.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.121
Mom,
they're like family.

19:01.123 --> 19:02.823
No. They are family.

19:02.825 --> 19:06.393
Tommy, I can barely keep
up with the two of us.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.295
I promise
I'll watch them.

19:08.297 --> 19:11.565
We've already had
this conversation.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.367
Money's just too tight.

19:13.369 --> 19:16.503
I can't afford vet bills
for four cats.

19:16.505 --> 19:17.538
Mom, please?

19:17.540 --> 19:19.306
I'm sorry, but you know

19:19.308 --> 19:22.109
that they're gonna have
to go up for adoption.

19:22.111 --> 19:25.212
You never listen
to what I want!

19:43.732 --> 19:47.302
I'm old enough to choose whether
I celebrate Christmas or not.

19:47.304 --> 19:51.706
I bought this after school the day
before Christmas vacation.

19:53.175 --> 19:57.011
Hey, you guys want
to hear a Christmas story?

19:57.713 --> 19:58.847
"Merry Christmas to all,

19:58.849 --> 20:02.284
and to all a good night."

20:02.286 --> 20:03.819
I like that story.

20:03.821 --> 20:04.820
Did you like
that story?

20:04.922 --> 20:08.257
This kid has talent for
telling great stories.

20:08.259 --> 20:09.291
Oh, no!

20:09.293 --> 20:12.761
I want to
eat that book. Mmm.

20:14.598 --> 20:17.967
Oh no! The Christmas
tree!

20:17.969 --> 20:19.401
Is everything okay?

20:19.403 --> 20:22.438
Yep. Just getting ready
for sleep.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.107
Tommy, honey, we have
to talk about the kittens.

20:25.109 --> 20:28.010
Well, good night.

20:32.450 --> 20:34.884
Good night.

20:34.886 --> 20:36.720
What is this?

20:36.722 --> 20:38.154
What's what?

20:38.156 --> 20:39.689
That.

20:39.691 --> 20:41.791
My Christmas tree.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.893
Please
don't take it away.

20:43.895 --> 20:44.527
Where did you get it?

20:44.529 --> 20:48.531
You said people should
work for what they want,

20:48.533 --> 20:50.000
and I bought it
with my allowance.

20:50.002 --> 20:53.870
Tommy, I'm glad you
understand that if you save,

20:53.872 --> 20:56.139
you can get
the things you want,

20:56.141 --> 20:58.876
but I can't allow you
to have that.

20:58.978 --> 21:03.881
- But, Mom...
- Tommy, how many times have I told you?

21:03.883 --> 21:04.915
Santa isn't real.

21:04.917 --> 21:07.251
And there's no need
to have a tree

21:07.253 --> 21:09.987
if we're not gonna put
presents underneath it.

21:09.989 --> 21:12.256
- I know, but--
- Tommy.

21:12.258 --> 21:14.892
- Go away.
- Tommy!

21:14.894 --> 21:16.560
I said go away!

21:16.562 --> 21:19.297
I'm sick of having
to act like an adult!

21:19.299 --> 21:21.465
I'm gonna prove
that Santa's real!

21:21.467 --> 21:23.734
Tommy.

21:23.736 --> 21:27.371
I said go away!

21:30.643 --> 21:31.743
First, Christmas?

21:31.745 --> 21:34.079
I wonder what
she'll take away next?

21:34.081 --> 21:37.516
I wonder what Easter's
like around here.

21:37.518 --> 21:39.351
Poor Tommy.

23:15.985 --> 23:17.919
I built this box
for you.

23:17.921 --> 23:19.854
I'm gonna put you
in it.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.790
I'm gonna give it
to Santa.

23:21.792 --> 23:22.824
You're
gonna be nice,

23:22.826 --> 23:25.894
because he's gonna
take care of you.

23:26.529 --> 23:29.965
I promise, I'll never do
anything bad again.

23:29.967 --> 23:32.768
What--What--No.
Wait. Wait. What?

23:32.770 --> 23:34.570
Wait. Aww!

23:35.272 --> 23:38.441
Ehh!
Can I even fit in here?

23:38.443 --> 23:41.076
I'm gonna miss you guys.

23:46.917 --> 23:48.517
We got
to get out of here.

23:48.519 --> 23:50.653
Maybe Mom
will hear us.

23:51.789 --> 23:52.855
Shh.

23:52.857 --> 23:56.559
She can't hear us. She
must be sleeping.

24:00.231 --> 24:01.164
Oh, no.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.700
He's taking us
to our new home.

24:03.702 --> 24:06.102
But we
want to stay here!

24:06.104 --> 24:07.471
Where's Mom? Mom?

24:07.473 --> 24:09.306
I don't want to go!

24:09.308 --> 24:10.640
Mom? Mom?

24:10.642 --> 24:12.976
Don't worry.
I'll get us out.

24:12.978 --> 24:16.179
We promise we'll
be good from now on!

24:16.181 --> 24:17.681
I swear!

24:22.053 --> 24:24.488
Ouch! You stepped
on my tail!

24:24.490 --> 24:25.889
Sorry.

24:26.892 --> 24:29.627
Guys, I'll be right back.

24:32.297 --> 24:35.900
Does that mean we can
get out of this box soon?

24:35.902 --> 24:36.767
I don't know.

24:36.769 --> 24:38.970
He said he'd
be right back.

24:50.816 --> 24:52.216
I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

24:52.218 --> 24:54.252
I'm gonna
miss you, too, Tommy.

24:54.254 --> 24:57.222
You guys were
my best friends.

25:10.670 --> 25:14.740
Oh, no! Mom, help!

25:14.742 --> 25:18.677
Tommy, wait!

25:19.178 --> 25:21.179
Tommy wasn't
kidding, then.

25:21.181 --> 25:24.616
He really is
giving us to Santa.

25:58.853 --> 26:00.654
Oh, he's close.
He's close.

26:00.656 --> 26:02.489
Come on.
Where are you?

26:02.491 --> 26:04.058
There you are.

26:12.934 --> 26:14.902
He's here.

26:21.009 --> 26:22.610
Come on.

26:22.612 --> 26:25.112
Whoa! Whoa!

26:25.114 --> 26:27.315
Good job, Donner, Blitzen!

26:27.317 --> 26:31.186
Those Thompson twins
almost caught us.

26:31.188 --> 26:32.854
What am I doing here?

26:32.856 --> 26:34.789
I haven't been here
for years.

26:34.791 --> 26:37.425
I have no presents
for this address.

26:37.427 --> 26:39.561
Records indicate
a pick-up at this site.

26:39.563 --> 26:41.062
Please proceed
to the chimney.

26:41.064 --> 26:41.830
No, no. You don't--

26:41.832 --> 26:44.666
I don't think there's any
presents for this address.

26:44.668 --> 26:47.235
Records indicate
a pick-up at this site.

26:47.237 --> 26:50.905
Please proceed
to the chimney.

26:50.907 --> 26:52.774
All right.

26:52.776 --> 26:55.543
All right.

26:55.545 --> 26:56.646
Here we go.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.115
Come on.
Tune in. Tune in.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.083
No, tracking node,
come on.

27:01.085 --> 27:03.686
Flip over.
Flip over.

27:06.491 --> 27:08.224
Heh heh. Wow,

27:08.226 --> 27:10.660
it has certainly been a
while since I've been here.

27:10.662 --> 27:13.429
This guy needs to lay off the cookies.

27:13.431 --> 27:15.998
- Wait. Is that Santa?
- It is.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.401
Maybe he's gonna
take us to our new home.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.369
But I like this one.

27:20.371 --> 27:22.004
"Dear Santa, Mom--"

27:23.441 --> 27:25.441
Hmm?

27:25.443 --> 27:28.945
Oh. Cookies.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.114
He gets cookies?

27:31.116 --> 27:33.617
Aw, that's not fair.

27:35.019 --> 27:37.688
- Mom?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.156
Uh-oh.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.057
No.

27:40.059 --> 27:40.891
Wait!
Whoa!

27:40.893 --> 27:42.693
- Wait!
- What's going on now?

27:42.695 --> 27:43.527
Hey, guys!

27:43.529 --> 27:44.428
Where is he taking us?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.864
I never even got to say
goodbye to the litter box!

27:46.866 --> 27:50.467
What's going on?
Whoa! Whoa!

27:50.469 --> 27:53.503
Wait! Why are we
up on the roof?

27:56.041 --> 27:58.576
Whew. That was close.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.282
Let's see
what we have here.

28:04.284 --> 28:06.117
We have a note.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.752
It's Santa.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.357
I gotta record this.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.731
Tape. I need a tape.

28:19.733 --> 28:20.832
What have we got here?

28:20.834 --> 28:23.835
"Dear Santa, Mom won't
let me keep kittens.

28:23.837 --> 28:25.471
Please take--"
Kittens?

28:25.473 --> 28:27.639
Fifth grade recital,
no.

28:27.641 --> 28:29.742
Ballet classes, no.

28:29.744 --> 28:30.609
Kittens?

28:30.611 --> 28:32.911
No, no. N-No.
No kittens.

28:32.913 --> 28:36.782
"Sharknado,"
definitely not.

28:36.784 --> 28:39.318
Dad's farewell speech,
yes!

28:39.753 --> 28:42.788
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.391
Come on.

28:46.393 --> 28:49.561
Kittens. Kitten.

28:52.433 --> 28:53.932
Ouch!

28:53.934 --> 28:55.835
I'm gonna hurl!
My tail!

28:55.837 --> 28:58.404
Just a hair ball.

28:58.406 --> 28:59.973
Oh, jeez. Come on.

29:05.546 --> 29:07.747
Oh, no!

29:07.749 --> 29:09.349
Santa?

29:09.351 --> 29:12.452
That was weird.

29:12.454 --> 29:14.154
Uh, guys?

29:14.156 --> 29:17.290
I think
we broke Santa.

29:18.993 --> 29:20.460
He's not moving.

29:20.462 --> 29:23.029
Tastes
like cookies.

29:23.031 --> 29:25.533
Hey, guys, I think
we broke him.

29:25.535 --> 29:27.701
Let me check
his pulse.

29:27.703 --> 29:30.805
Psst! Up here, dudes!

29:32.140 --> 29:33.908
Whoa, you can talk?

29:33.910 --> 29:35.409
Whoa! Like, so can you.

29:35.411 --> 29:37.912
Come on. Clock's a-ticking,
little dudes.

29:37.914 --> 29:38.913
What do you mean?

29:38.915 --> 29:41.415
These presents aren't gonna
deliver themselves, little bud.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.918
You'll have to fill in
for the big man.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.087
Things just can't get
any worse.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.924
And then
this happens.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.898
Come on!
I'll drive.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.266
You can't even walk
on four legs.

29:58.268 --> 30:00.468
How do you expect
to drive this thing?

30:00.470 --> 30:02.037
Ooh. Hey. Hey.

30:02.039 --> 30:03.138
Fish sticks.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.105
Aw, you guys.

30:04.107 --> 30:09.411
I can't get in,
you guys! Wait!

30:14.917 --> 30:16.718
Santa?

30:18.821 --> 30:20.956
Are you here?

30:23.359 --> 30:25.561
Santa?

30:30.567 --> 30:33.836
Hmm, how do you
work this thing?

30:33.838 --> 30:34.871
Hey, furry dude,

30:34.873 --> 30:39.642
hit the little red button
next to the screen.

30:40.777 --> 30:41.777
This one?

30:41.779 --> 30:43.212
Hello, and welcome

30:43.214 --> 30:44.947
to the Santa Sleigh 3000.

30:44.949 --> 30:45.681
I'm Tinsel.

30:45.683 --> 30:49.451
I will be your liaison
to the H.O.L.I.D.A.Y.,

30:49.453 --> 30:55.692
Helpful omni-longitudinal, international,
directional, accurate yuletide system.

30:55.694 --> 30:59.897
System complete with CPS,

30:59.899 --> 31:01.999
Christmas
Positioning System.

31:02.001 --> 31:04.368
It appears that the sleigh
has not moved

31:04.370 --> 31:06.136
in the recommended
amount of time,

31:06.138 --> 31:08.005
and the weight ratio
is incorrect.

31:08.007 --> 31:10.440
The last call
was a distress call.

31:10.442 --> 31:11.975
If the last call
is incorrect,

31:11.977 --> 31:14.177
please select the Home button
to recalibrate.

31:14.179 --> 31:17.014
Otherwise, please select
from the following,

31:17.016 --> 31:18.115
Santa emergency,

31:18.117 --> 31:19.583
sleigh emergency,
reindeer emergency.

31:19.585 --> 31:22.519
Santa emergency.
Hit "Santa emergency," Patches.

31:22.521 --> 31:25.490
You've selected
Santa emergency.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.292
Please choose
from which type.

31:27.294 --> 31:28.126
Present malfunction,

31:28.128 --> 31:31.262
lack of cookies,
incapacitation.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.064
Incom-pasa-what?

31:33.066 --> 31:34.132
Incapacitation!

31:34.134 --> 31:36.601
Push the button,
Patches!

31:36.603 --> 31:38.136
Remain calm.

31:38.138 --> 31:41.105
In case
of Santa incapacitation,

31:41.107 --> 31:43.341
please retrieve
Santa's cloth receptacle

31:43.343 --> 31:45.076
if it has not already
been located.

31:45.078 --> 31:48.346
Then procure the
supersonic aerial vessel,

31:48.348 --> 31:50.949
<i>and reassure
the rangifer tarandus</i>

31:50.951 --> 31:52.050
are in adequate condition

31:52.052 --> 31:54.252
to help aid you
on your journey.

31:55.889 --> 31:57.256
Santa?

31:57.258 --> 32:00.092
The content
in the cloth receptacle

32:00.094 --> 32:01.593
must be cross-referenced

32:01.595 --> 32:04.697
with the most current
behavioral scroll.

32:04.699 --> 32:07.733
The scroll, or naughty
and nice list

32:07.735 --> 32:08.734
in layman's terms,

32:08.736 --> 32:12.571
can be located underneath
the aerial vessel...

32:13.373 --> 32:16.809
or sleigh's dashboard.

32:18.244 --> 32:19.912
I think we found it!

32:19.914 --> 32:21.680
Good job, sis!

32:21.682 --> 32:23.916
This list features all those

32:23.918 --> 32:26.786
who are naughty and nice
from around the world.

32:26.788 --> 32:28.521
The glowing name indicates

32:28.523 --> 32:30.857
who's next in line
for content delivery.

32:30.859 --> 32:32.492
Just say the name
on the list,

32:32.494 --> 32:34.527
<i>and the rangifer tarandus
and aerial vessel</i>

32:34.529 --> 32:38.098
will allow you to fly off
to your next destination.

32:38.100 --> 32:44.471
But, remember,
you must stay on schedule.

32:44.473 --> 32:47.073
All content, presents,

32:47.075 --> 32:49.209
must be delivered
by sunrise.

32:50.144 --> 32:53.713
Sunrise? That's like
in six hours!

32:53.715 --> 32:54.682
If the younger humans

32:54.684 --> 32:56.584
do not receive presents
on Christmas,

32:56.586 --> 32:58.185
there will be riots
in the street,

32:58.187 --> 32:59.487
and everyone
at the North Pole

32:59.489 --> 33:03.391
will be out of a
job, including me,

33:03.393 --> 33:04.892
so good luck,

33:04.894 --> 33:09.063
and please refer to
the H.O.L.I.D.A.Y guide anytime

33:09.065 --> 33:13.100
if you are in need
of assistance.

33:13.102 --> 33:14.335
Now what?

33:14.803 --> 33:17.938
Now let's gt this show
on the road.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.973
We'll have to hurry!

33:18.975 --> 33:21.442
This is to keep
our home, guys!

33:22.444 --> 33:24.713
Carrie Bailey
up next!

33:24.715 --> 33:25.580
Awesome!

33:25.582 --> 33:27.149
Carrie Bailey!
Let's go!

33:27.151 --> 33:28.950
Whoa! Where are
the seat belts?

33:28.952 --> 33:31.286
- Whoa!
- This is amazing!

33:31.288 --> 33:32.521
Oh, my God.

33:32.523 --> 33:34.489
Oh, he's leaving!

33:36.527 --> 33:37.692
Santa!

33:40.897 --> 33:43.065
Whoa!

33:46.136 --> 33:49.404
- Help!
- No. Oh, God! No, don't leave!

33:49.406 --> 33:51.706
Please. Oh, Lord.
Oh, come on!

33:51.708 --> 33:54.243
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

33:54.245 --> 33:57.847
- Whoa!
- Slow down!
- How do you fly this thing?

33:57.849 --> 34:00.583
He's going around
the other way!

34:00.585 --> 34:04.454
- Whoa! We're gonna die!

34:04.922 --> 34:06.389
Santa!

34:06.890 --> 34:10.059
- Kittens?
- Whoa! Where are the brakes.

34:10.061 --> 34:11.460
Come on, come on,
come on. Come on.

34:11.463 --> 34:14.263
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

34:14.264 --> 34:15.898
Santa!

34:18.635 --> 34:21.437
Bye Tommy!

34:34.119 --> 34:35.886
Hey, man,
did I ever tell you guys

34:35.888 --> 34:38.755
about that time that I took
the sleigh out by myself?

34:38.757 --> 34:39.489
Man, I was
in so much trouble

34:39.492 --> 34:43.460
when I got back to the
North Pole, but it was sweet!

34:43.462 --> 34:47.397
Great. There went my one
chance to meet Santa.

34:47.399 --> 34:49.032
That's not Santa.

34:49.034 --> 34:50.333
Those are
my kittens.

34:50.335 --> 34:52.768
Well, if those
are your kittens,

34:52.771 --> 34:54.772
then where's Santa?

35:01.081 --> 35:02.413
Hmm.

35:02.415 --> 35:05.183
All right.
Let's get you inside.

35:12.892 --> 35:13.791
Hey!

35:13.793 --> 35:15.326
Da da da

35:16.328 --> 35:18.463
Wake up!

35:18.465 --> 35:21.900
Santa, why are
you so fat?

35:30.810 --> 35:32.044
Whew.

35:37.484 --> 35:39.351
- Whee!
- Whoo- hoo!

35:43.190 --> 35:44.757
Getting down the chimney.

35:44.759 --> 35:47.993
All you have to do
is touch the bag,

35:47.995 --> 35:50.596
and it will do the rest.

35:50.598 --> 35:52.831
Whoa!

36:12.753 --> 36:13.286
Oh, great!

36:13.288 --> 36:15.222
How are we supposed
to get the presents

36:15.224 --> 36:17.157
up in the stockings?

36:17.159 --> 36:18.458
I'm not sure.

36:18.460 --> 36:19.726
I got it.

36:19.728 --> 36:22.762
Catapult ready. Fire!

36:23.332 --> 36:24.699
Great job!

36:24.701 --> 36:27.068
- Three-pointer.
- Heh heh. Yes!

36:27.070 --> 36:28.903
All this work is making me
hungry.

36:28.905 --> 36:31.739
Whoo-hoo!
Milk and cookies!

36:31.741 --> 36:35.843
Oh, pretty.
The lights.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.011
Any tuna flavor?

36:37.013 --> 36:39.547
Ohh.

36:40.550 --> 36:43.084
Guys, I'm kind of
stuck here in the tree.

36:43.086 --> 36:44.285
Help. Help, guys!

36:44.287 --> 36:46.621
- Coming.
- Ah, boy. Here we go.

36:46.623 --> 36:47.788
We'll get you out!

36:47.790 --> 36:49.724
Just hang on,
Hairball!

36:49.726 --> 36:50.725
Don't move!

36:50.727 --> 36:53.262
I moved.
Now the tree's moving.

36:53.264 --> 36:55.797
Stop moving,
or else you'll--

36:55.799 --> 36:57.566
Or I'll what?

37:03.873 --> 37:05.674
Timber!

37:43.714 --> 37:46.349
Tommy.

37:59.931 --> 38:03.133
Those were for Santa.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.313
Whew. Okay, big guy.

38:44.377 --> 38:46.044
Maisy.

38:46.046 --> 38:47.445
Maisy?

38:47.447 --> 38:49.381
Oh, there you are.

38:49.949 --> 38:51.616
What's wrong
with you?

38:54.521 --> 38:56.822
There's nothing there.

38:59.159 --> 39:02.194
Fine, but I'm
going back to bed.

39:02.196 --> 39:05.097
Let me know
if you capture Santa.

39:20.080 --> 39:20.813
Santa.

39:20.815 --> 39:23.417
Honey,
don't touch me there.

39:23.419 --> 39:24.484
Santa.

39:24.486 --> 39:26.620
No, Mrs. Claus, don't.

39:26.622 --> 39:28.054
Santa.

39:34.897 --> 39:38.432
Santa, this is gonna
be a long night.

39:38.434 --> 39:41.201
How does it
look, guys?

39:41.203 --> 39:43.537
Um, looks good?

39:43.539 --> 39:46.406
Hey,
I did my best.

39:47.543 --> 39:49.042
Hurry.
Someone's coming!

39:49.044 --> 39:52.680
Quick! How did Tinsel say
to get out of here?

40:09.264 --> 40:10.298
That was close.

40:10.300 --> 40:13.267
Hey, guys? Uh,
could we make a pit stop?

40:13.269 --> 40:14.469
You'll have
to hold it.

40:14.471 --> 40:16.704
We have a schedule
to keep to.

40:19.341 --> 40:21.042
Santa?

40:22.378 --> 40:24.413
Santa?

40:51.475 --> 40:55.311
This is made with organic
cinnamon essence.

41:01.218 --> 41:04.187
There's gotta be
something else.

41:36.187 --> 41:40.291
I thought Mom didn't
celebrate Christmas.

42:03.282 --> 42:04.950
Ohh!

42:13.693 --> 42:16.828
Why isn't this working?

42:24.906 --> 42:28.007
Who are you, and
where am I?

42:28.009 --> 42:31.010
I'm Tommy,
and you're in my house.

42:31.012 --> 42:33.579
Well, go close
those blinds.

42:33.581 --> 42:36.349
I can't have
anybody see me.

42:43.624 --> 42:45.758
Ah, come on.

42:51.799 --> 42:53.367
Thank you.

42:53.369 --> 42:55.335
I'm--I'm sorry.
I just--

42:55.337 --> 42:56.837
I just can't have
anybody see me.

42:56.839 --> 43:00.240
It'll be the whole end of my career.

43:07.282 --> 43:10.317
Are you allergic to cats?

43:10.685 --> 43:13.387
Why does everybody
always ask me that?

43:13.389 --> 43:15.722
I'm allergic
to a lot of things,

43:15.724 --> 43:19.626
cats, legumes,
certain metals,

43:19.628 --> 43:23.631
nightshade plants like
tomatoes and peppers.

43:23.633 --> 43:25.733
- Really?
- Don't worry.

43:25.735 --> 43:28.169
It's okay. It's fine.

43:28.171 --> 43:31.939
My mother was allergic
to all those things.

43:31.941 --> 43:33.441
I am, too. Heh.

43:33.443 --> 43:34.208
It's genetic.

43:34.210 --> 43:38.212
Who would have thought
that Santa is such a mess?

43:52.930 --> 43:54.563
Hi, kitty.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.566
Nice kitty.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.636
Stay. Stay, kitty.

44:01.539 --> 44:03.505
S-Stay. Stay, kitty.

44:03.507 --> 44:05.007
Ah, no.

44:05.475 --> 44:08.644
No, no. Ow, ow, ow.
Don't-- Don't do that.

44:09.547 --> 44:14.817
Kitty. Kitty. W-What
are you doing-- Ahh!

44:20.191 --> 44:23.059
Gotcha.

44:25.796 --> 44:27.731
Cats.

44:35.973 --> 44:39.109
Cats.

44:39.111 --> 44:41.277
Cats. Meow!

44:41.279 --> 44:45.048
Purr! Rawr!

44:45.050 --> 44:47.150
I'm gonna get
those cats!

44:47.152 --> 44:49.119
Guys, look. There.
Right there!

44:49.121 --> 44:51.122
There's a giant
litter box.

44:51.124 --> 44:52.690
Jeez, fine.

44:52.692 --> 44:53.424
Finally.

44:53.426 --> 44:55.727
Gotta go. Gotta go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

44:55.729 --> 44:57.695
Aw, man.
Gotta go.

44:57.697 --> 45:00.965
- Can't wait!
- I'm gonna get all dirty again!

45:00.967 --> 45:02.733
Hairball, wait!
Mittens, wait!

45:02.735 --> 45:06.937
We'd better get adopted to
some really nice homes, Santa.

45:06.939 --> 45:08.506
I mean, come on!

45:09.207 --> 45:11.175
You look over there!

45:17.850 --> 45:20.385
Guys,
a little privacy?

45:20.387 --> 45:22.888
Oh, sorry.
Oh, um...

45:25.192 --> 45:26.758
Don't listen
to me go!

45:27.461 --> 45:30.929
Never mind. Just gonna
go over here.

45:31.998 --> 45:35.200
Guys, you should
take a look at this.

45:40.573 --> 45:42.841
We're on a house.

45:49.182 --> 45:52.685
Heads up Mittens. We're coming
down too.

45:52.687 --> 45:56.088
Ugh!
This place gives me the creeps!

45:56.090 --> 46:00.159
Hairball, a litter box
gives you the creeps.

46:02.296 --> 46:04.664
Whoa! look at this tree!

46:06.533 --> 46:08.334
Hide!
Someone's coming!

46:10.238 --> 46:11.537
What was that?

46:11.539 --> 46:12.839
I don't know.

46:12.841 --> 46:15.842
Hello!

46:15.844 --> 46:16.642
Oh, God!

46:16.644 --> 46:18.244
It's just a nice
little girl, guys.

46:18.246 --> 46:20.647
- You're not Santa!
- And you're not little.

46:20.649 --> 46:21.515
But you are cute.

46:21.517 --> 46:22.549
She's starting
to freak me out.

46:22.551 --> 46:25.485
Are you thirsty?
Could I get a cheeseburger?

46:25.487 --> 46:27.554
I'll get you some water.

46:28.356 --> 46:30.257
I thought
she'd never leave.

46:30.259 --> 46:31.992
Okay, we've gotta
get out of here.

46:31.994 --> 46:34.595
Yeah, let's just leave the
present and skedaddle.

46:34.597 --> 46:36.396
You guys,
she could be the one,

46:36.398 --> 46:37.931
the one that'll
take care of us.

46:37.933 --> 46:40.133
Yeah, maybe if you
want to end up

46:40.135 --> 46:42.002
with a missing
eyeball or tail.

46:42.004 --> 46:45.005
Did you see
those pigtails?

46:45.007 --> 46:48.275
I'm back! I brought you
some water.

46:48.277 --> 46:50.144
And my cheeseburger?

46:51.480 --> 46:53.581
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Come here, kitties.

46:53.583 --> 46:56.885
- Patches, no!
- Kitty, come here!

46:56.887 --> 46:57.452
Patches!

46:57.454 --> 47:00.221
- Ah, that's much better.
- He's doomed.

47:00.223 --> 47:02.223
You can live
with me now.

47:02.225 --> 47:04.792
We'll be
best friends.

47:06.229 --> 47:07.595
We don't
have time for this.

47:07.797 --> 47:11.099
- We have a schedule to keep.
- We still have a lot of
presents to be delivered.

47:11.101 --> 47:14.202
We need Patches.
We must do something.

47:20.777 --> 47:22.845
Let's dress you up.

47:23.713 --> 47:27.249
Nope. Nope. Nope.

47:27.251 --> 47:28.918
That one's horrible.

47:29.820 --> 47:31.053
What's she
doing to him?

47:31.055 --> 47:32.054
Listen. I have a plan,

47:32.056 --> 47:34.223
but you're gonna
have to trust me.

47:35.792 --> 47:37.126
- Perfect!
- Hey!

47:37.128 --> 47:41.330
- Ow!
- Aww. Poor kitty is sick.

47:42.832 --> 47:43.666
Kill me.

47:43.668 --> 47:48.437
Oh, no! My other babies
are sick, too!

47:51.208 --> 47:52.375
You guys need rest.

47:52.377 --> 47:53.944
Two of you
have been sick,

47:53.946 --> 47:56.746
and one of you has been
a very naughty kitty.

47:56.748 --> 47:58.415
This is
humiliating!

47:58.417 --> 48:01.084
But I still love you.

48:01.086 --> 48:03.653
Come on, Pedro.

48:05.056 --> 48:07.691
Good night,
my kitties!

48:15.433 --> 48:17.667
Oh, guys,
a little help, please?

48:18.838 --> 48:21.138
I think
you look cute.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.274
Okay,
not funny, guys.

48:23.276 --> 48:25.576
I think she's asleep.

48:28.747 --> 48:29.914
Maybe we should stay.

48:29.916 --> 48:31.816
She seems
to really like us.

48:31.818 --> 48:34.485
I'm a prisoner.

48:35.187 --> 48:37.254
Get out!

48:37.256 --> 48:40.358
Okay, let's make
a break for it!

48:40.360 --> 48:41.759
Run! Run! Run! Run!

48:41.761 --> 48:44.128
Where are you going,
my kitties?

48:45.198 --> 48:47.598
Run! Run! Run! Run!
Get back here!

48:47.600 --> 48:51.003
Run! Run--
Oh, my shadow.

48:55.274 --> 48:57.876
I did not look cute
in that dress.

49:03.016 --> 49:06.351
We gotta hurry! Some many
couple hours left till sunrise.

49:06.353 --> 49:08.487
And we still have the country
to go!

49:08.489 --> 49:09.888
Hah!

49:09.890 --> 49:11.289
Hah!

49:11.291 --> 49:12.457
Oh, cute!

49:12.459 --> 49:14.493
I say we keep 'em.

49:14.495 --> 49:15.660
Yeah, let's get 'em!

49:15.662 --> 49:17.362
Nope. Not playing
dress-up again.

49:17.364 --> 49:19.322
- Let's get out of here.
- Get 'em!

49:19.331 --> 49:21.135
- Let's go!
- I'm coming!

49:21.136 --> 49:22.902
Are we done yet?

49:22.904 --> 49:24.103
Not even close.

49:24.105 --> 49:25.038
Aw, man!

49:25.040 --> 49:27.006
Now who's next
on the list?

49:31.078 --> 49:33.746
Oh for Ashley.

49:34.681 --> 49:37.517
And one for Rachel.

49:37.818 --> 49:39.252
Ashley. Ashley.

49:39.254 --> 49:41.187
Mm. Huh?
Wake up.

49:46.226 --> 49:49.263
Wow.

49:49.531 --> 49:54.368
Okay, got it.
Run! There's a dog!

49:54.370 --> 49:56.036
Ahh!

49:57.372 --> 50:01.008
Ha ha. Hairball, stop
playing around.

50:02.811 --> 50:04.745
Thank you.

50:04.747 --> 50:06.914
Merry Christmas!

50:07.716 --> 50:09.616
I'm starting
to get hungry.

50:09.618 --> 50:14.054
- On your mark, set...
- Go!

50:36.712 --> 50:39.047
Squeak!

50:44.620 --> 50:47.755
Squeak, Maisy.

50:52.596 --> 50:54.130
Oh, no, look at me!

50:54.132 --> 50:55.564
I'm a poor
defenseless little mouse

50:55.566 --> 50:59.969
who's in the middle of this
wide-open grassy knoll thingy,

51:00.804 --> 51:03.706
and I am way too old,
blind and slow to move,

51:03.708 --> 51:06.242
but yet
you cannot catch me.

51:06.244 --> 51:10.312
You must be the silliest,
stupidest cat in history.

51:13.483 --> 51:17.253
Oh, oh, look how close
you're getting.

51:17.255 --> 51:19.890
Oh, you're
so close now.

51:19.892 --> 51:23.693
Can't you smell
my goody mouseness?

51:24.662 --> 51:27.130
Closer.

51:27.132 --> 51:29.166
Closer.

51:29.168 --> 51:31.034
Closer.

51:31.969 --> 51:33.637
Closer.

51:38.577 --> 51:40.844
I got you.
I got you, kitty.

51:40.846 --> 51:44.881
Yeah, not as smart as
you look, are you?  Huh?

51:46.150 --> 51:48.286
I can't believe
you fell for that mouse,

51:48.288 --> 51:50.955
you silly little
four-legged rodent.

51:50.957 --> 51:52.523
That's right.

51:52.525 --> 51:54.325
What?

51:54.327 --> 51:56.794
Oh, shut up, cat.

51:58.430 --> 51:59.797
We're almost done, guys.

51:59.799 --> 52:01.832
That's great.
Homeward bound soon.

52:01.834 --> 52:02.967
What's that sound?

52:02.969 --> 52:05.436
Nothing, Hairball.
Probably just the wind.

52:05.438 --> 52:06.404
Look out!

52:08.641 --> 52:10.508
Shh!

52:10.510 --> 52:13.211
Quiet.
Shh!

52:21.354 --> 52:24.423
Not a word.
Not a word, cat.

52:24.425 --> 52:26.225
Not a word.

52:26.227 --> 52:28.527
Not a word from you.

52:28.529 --> 52:30.462
Ah, no!
We're gonna crash!

52:30.464 --> 52:32.030
Patches, do something!

52:32.032 --> 52:35.567
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

52:35.569 --> 52:37.436
I think
I'm gonna be sick!

52:37.438 --> 52:38.470
Ah, no!

52:38.472 --> 52:39.705
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

52:39.707 --> 52:42.374
Whoa!
We're going down!

52:46.279 --> 52:47.480
We're out of control!

52:47.482 --> 52:50.416
Patches, put us down
in the snow!

52:53.454 --> 52:55.688
If you would be
so kind to point out

52:55.690 --> 52:57.156
where my reindeer
and sleigh are.

52:57.158 --> 52:59.892
I am on a tight schedule, you see,

52:59.894 --> 53:01.928
and I've gotta
get going.

53:02.029 --> 53:04.530
Get away from my son,
you shopping mall freak!

53:04.532 --> 53:06.699
Wait! Wait!

53:06.701 --> 53:08.234
- I'm Santa Claus.
- Oh, sure.

53:08.236 --> 53:09.736
And I'm Kate Middleton.

53:09.738 --> 53:11.571
Listen. Stop.

53:12.539 --> 53:14.307
Put that down.

53:15.442 --> 53:17.076
Watch.

53:21.049 --> 53:23.317
That's just a magic trick.

53:23.319 --> 53:25.586
You had a candy cane
in your other hand.

53:25.588 --> 53:27.254
Okay.

53:27.256 --> 53:28.656
Watch that.

53:37.932 --> 53:39.700
Hmm?

53:39.702 --> 53:41.168
Nice try.

53:42.038 --> 53:44.738
Tommy, go to my bedroom,

53:44.740 --> 53:46.607
and get my cellphone.

53:46.609 --> 53:48.443
No, Mom.
That's the real Santa.

53:48.445 --> 53:52.147
Tommy, we've talked about this
time and time again.

53:52.149 --> 53:53.815
Santa's not real.

53:53.817 --> 53:54.549
Yes, he is.

53:54.551 --> 53:55.717
I saw him
fall off the roof.

53:55.719 --> 53:58.753
Well, now I know you're
just making things up.

53:58.755 --> 54:02.123
Come on, Santa.
Show her.

54:02.125 --> 54:03.224
Tommy...

54:03.226 --> 54:05.293
did you buy a
Christmas tree this year

54:05.295 --> 54:07.329
with your own
allowance money?

54:07.331 --> 54:09.964
Do you know where
that tree is now?

54:11.534 --> 54:14.703
Well, why don't you go
look in the garage?

54:16.272 --> 54:19.075
You couldn't do it,
could you?

54:19.409 --> 54:22.478
You couldn't throw away his
Christmas tree, could you, Julia?

54:22.480 --> 54:25.715
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

54:25.717 --> 54:28.184
And who told you
about that tree?

54:28.186 --> 54:29.251
Did Tommy tell you?

54:29.253 --> 54:33.489
I'm Santa Claus.
Is that so hard to believe?

54:33.491 --> 54:35.491
Yes.

54:38.128 --> 54:41.030
Ah, there you are.

54:47.873 --> 54:51.908
Maisy.
Stop it. God.

54:51.910 --> 54:57.214
Whoa! What the-- What
has gotten into you?

55:01.754 --> 55:04.087
Here you go, Santa.

55:04.222 --> 55:06.490
Why, thank you,
Tommy.

55:16.568 --> 55:20.705
Enough with this phony baloney.
I'm calling the cops.

55:20.707 --> 55:22.273
Mom, wait!

55:22.275 --> 55:25.376
Just watch. Watch.

55:38.257 --> 55:40.291
It's there.

55:40.859 --> 55:43.227
Come on.
You're in there.

55:48.568 --> 55:50.335
Yes.

55:56.910 --> 55:59.778
- Ho ho ho ho!
- Whoa!

55:59.780 --> 56:01.880
Yes.

56:12.525 --> 56:14.760
Awesome!

56:15.929 --> 56:18.565
Merry Christmas!

56:39.820 --> 56:42.422
- Mom! You gotta come out!
- No!

56:42.424 --> 56:44.224
Julia! Julia, I'm here!

56:44.226 --> 56:45.492
Mom, please!

56:45.494 --> 56:46.994
I'm calling
the cops!

56:46.996 --> 56:49.597
Wait. Julia...

56:50.198 --> 56:51.165
Come on.

56:51.167 --> 56:53.400
Come on, come on.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.713
Wow.

57:11.953 --> 57:13.854
Wow!

57:13.856 --> 57:15.891
Santa's hat.

57:18.929 --> 57:20.962
It's real.

57:26.636 --> 57:28.203
- Santa?
- I'm scared.

57:28.205 --> 57:31.039
- I want to go home.
- Wow, what's up dudes?

57:31.041 --> 57:32.541
- Oh my --
- Come on.

57:32.543 --> 57:35.277
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'm hungry.

57:35.279 --> 57:39.481
Let's find that list.
Just stay together.

57:52.095 --> 57:53.796
Oh, Maisy.

57:53.798 --> 57:54.931
I'm glad you're here.

57:54.933 --> 57:57.133
I'm gonna need
your help.

57:57.135 --> 57:59.869
You were eight years old
that Christmas.

57:59.871 --> 58:05.408
You had two cats,
Baxter and Rigby,

58:05.410 --> 58:07.310
and you wanted that 45

58:07.312 --> 58:09.612
more than anything else
in the world.

58:09.614 --> 58:11.013
What's a 45?

58:11.015 --> 58:13.249
It's a record.

58:13.251 --> 58:13.950
A what?

58:13.952 --> 58:16.787
Do you know
what a CD is?

58:16.789 --> 58:17.654
A what?

58:17.656 --> 58:20.857
Oh, never mind.

58:20.859 --> 58:23.160
Julia, the cat scared me,

58:23.162 --> 58:26.229
and I stumbled, and I
knocked that record down,

58:26.231 --> 58:27.965
and I broke it.

58:27.967 --> 58:31.435
But you kept it
even though it was broken,

58:31.437 --> 58:33.003
because you
wanted to remember

58:33.005 --> 58:36.907
that Christmas
when you actually saw me.

58:37.475 --> 58:38.942
And Marcus Bramble,

58:38.944 --> 58:41.445
he saw me, too,
that night.

58:41.447 --> 58:45.282
And for a while, the two
of you were inseparable.

58:45.284 --> 58:48.519
And you put up with
a lot of hazing and teasing

58:48.521 --> 58:52.557
by the other kids
because you believed in me.

58:54.226 --> 58:57.428
But finally you
couldn't take it anymore.

58:57.430 --> 59:00.565
Marcus could,
and he kept on.

59:00.567 --> 59:01.899
That's why you hated him,

59:01.901 --> 59:06.971
because he could do something
that you weren't able to.

59:07.573 --> 59:11.042
Mom, I saw the ornament
in the front closet.

59:11.044 --> 59:14.779
I know you believed
in Christmas.

59:16.850 --> 59:21.020
Julia, you didn't want to put
Tommy through that same hurt,

59:21.022 --> 59:25.624
through that pain, and so
you denied that I existed...

59:25.626 --> 59:27.259
but here I am.

59:27.927 --> 59:31.797
Your son,
he believed in me,

59:31.799 --> 59:34.900
and here I am.

59:45.146 --> 59:46.946
Santa?

59:49.484 --> 59:50.717
It really is you!

59:50.719 --> 59:53.620
Yes, it is.
Merry Christmas.

59:54.522 --> 59:57.157
Merry Christmas, dear.

59:58.392 --> 59:59.693
But why?

59:59.695 --> 01:00:02.929
Why did you let them
tease us like that?

01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:04.998
I begged and I begged
you to bring us proof

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.600
so that we could
show the other kids,

01:00:07.602 --> 01:00:10.737
but nothing
ever came.

01:00:10.739 --> 01:00:14.541
Julia, Christmas isn't
about proof or evidence.

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:19.313
It's about sharing in that
spirit and spreading the joy.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:22.483
Now, if I gave you
evidence of my existence,

01:00:22.485 --> 01:00:24.552
all that
would be in danger,

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.455
the North Pole,
Mrs. Claus,

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.356
the elves
and the reindeer.

01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:32.860
It wouldn't be very fair,
now, would it?

01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:37.732
I guess I have
pretty good proof now.

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.133
Here I am.

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.936
See, Mom? I told you I
could prove Santa's real.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:46.875
Tommy, I'm so sorry for
giving you such a hard time.

01:00:46.877 --> 01:00:52.414
It's just I didn't
want you to get hurt.

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:57.486
I know, Mom.

01:00:57.488 --> 01:01:00.288
Uh, now that my life
is no longer in danger,

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.857
maybe you guys
can help me.

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:03.558
I really
could use some help

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.193
getting my reindeer
and sleigh back.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:07.095
I mean,
it's getting very late.

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:08.764
I thought you knew.

01:01:08.766 --> 01:01:09.731
Knew what?

01:01:09.733 --> 01:01:12.200
The reindeer took off
with your sleigh.

01:01:12.202 --> 01:01:13.902
Huh?
And my kittens.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.773
You mean the kittens
that were in that box?

01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:18.207
Yeah.

01:01:18.209 --> 01:01:20.476
Oh, this is a disaster.

01:01:20.478 --> 01:01:22.512
It's almost sunrise.

01:01:22.514 --> 01:01:25.314
My magic runs out
at sunrise.

01:01:25.316 --> 01:01:29.218
If it comes out that Santa
didn't finish Christmas,

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:30.119
I'll be ruined!

01:01:30.121 --> 01:01:33.156
The kids'll riot
in the streets!

01:01:33.158 --> 01:01:35.024
They'll be--

01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:36.926
They won't go
to school anymore!

01:01:36.928 --> 01:01:39.562
And grown-ups wouldn't
be able to force them to--

01:01:39.564 --> 01:01:42.398
It'd be mass chaos
and hysteria!

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.833
It's terrible!

01:01:43.835 --> 01:01:46.937
It'd be a catastrophe!

01:01:46.939 --> 01:01:49.406
Santa, snap out of it!

01:01:53.212 --> 01:01:54.978
Oh. O-Okay.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.480
All right.

01:02:00.686 --> 01:02:04.087
Way to be
the designated driver, Patches.

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:05.789
We lost the list!

01:02:05.791 --> 01:02:08.091
Where are the reindeer?

01:02:08.093 --> 01:02:08.959
They're gone!

01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:11.095
You think they'll
come back for us?

01:02:11.097 --> 01:02:12.163
Pfft. Yeah, right.

01:02:12.165 --> 01:02:16.668
Those dummies probably don't
even know we're missing.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.403
Let's find
that list.

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:20.805
Just stay together.

01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:25.210
I'll find it!

01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:28.980
- Mittens, wait!
- Mittens!

01:02:28.982 --> 01:02:32.650
Who knows what kind of trouble
those kittens could be in,

01:02:32.652 --> 01:02:36.754
but we need to figure
a way to help them.

01:02:38.725 --> 01:02:41.192
This requires
some brain food.

01:02:41.194 --> 01:02:43.962
We have cookies.

01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:47.233
Did you say, "Cookies?"

01:02:48.835 --> 01:02:52.738
Hmm. A plan
to save Christmas.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:55.708
Well, Tommy,
I figured out

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:59.178
if I could take the
Christmas spirit from my hat

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:04.116
and add it to some
Chris--magic-- My hat!

01:03:04.118 --> 01:03:06.018
W-Where's my hat?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.654
Ever since that Christmas

01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:10.489
where Julia and I saw Santa,

01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:13.792
I've been so sad that she
didn't back me up

01:03:13.794 --> 01:03:17.197
when the other kids
made fun of me for it,

01:03:17.199 --> 01:03:20.033
and I spent
every Christmas since then

01:03:20.035 --> 01:03:21.635
paying tribute to Santa

01:03:21.637 --> 01:03:25.605
and trying to prove
that he is real.

01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:29.109
But now the power
of Santa's hat

01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:30.777
has shown me that Christmas

01:03:30.779 --> 01:03:33.280
isn't about
paying tribute to Santa.

01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:35.382
It's about loving others

01:03:35.384 --> 01:03:37.317
and being kind to others

01:03:37.319 --> 01:03:40.320
and helping those
who need my help,

01:03:40.322 --> 01:03:46.661
people like Julia...
and Tommy and you

01:03:46.763 --> 01:03:48.930
and your poor
little defenseless babies

01:03:48.932 --> 01:03:53.567
that are lost out there
in the cold of night all alone!

01:03:53.569 --> 01:03:55.870
I can help them!

01:03:55.872 --> 01:03:58.272
We can help them!

01:03:58.274 --> 01:04:04.145
Yes, let's go
find your kittens!

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.819
Great. I'm talking to a cat.

01:04:17.026 --> 01:04:19.928
Mittens! Hairball!

01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:21.964
Where are you?

01:04:22.165 --> 01:04:26.335
Where are you guys?

01:04:26.337 --> 01:04:29.271
We can't go on
without you, list.

01:04:29.273 --> 01:04:32.374
Come on. Where are you?

01:04:32.842 --> 01:04:36.044
Come on. Where are you?

01:04:36.679 --> 01:04:38.714
Dumb list!

01:04:42.318 --> 01:04:44.187
Patches! Mittens!

01:04:44.189 --> 01:04:46.522
Where are you?

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.702
I'm so cold.

01:05:08.178 --> 01:05:11.647
Please, I'll never
ask for anything again.

01:05:11.649 --> 01:05:15.386
All I want for Christmas
is my family back.

01:05:28.333 --> 01:05:31.035
Hey, man.

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:32.636
Hairball!

01:05:32.638 --> 01:05:34.405
Who were you
talking to?

01:05:34.407 --> 01:05:37.341
Uh, nobody.

01:05:37.343 --> 01:05:41.845
I lost Mittens. I don't know
if I can find her.

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:45.350
Oh, found her.

01:05:45.352 --> 01:05:46.251
Mittens!

01:05:46.253 --> 01:05:49.287
Miss me?
Told you I'd find it.

01:05:49.289 --> 01:05:50.755
What are we gonna do?

01:05:50.757 --> 01:05:53.224
Our elf support
won't answer.

01:05:53.226 --> 01:05:54.726
We're stranded.

01:05:56.729 --> 01:05:59.264
Okay, Maisy,
let's find 'em.

01:05:59.865 --> 01:06:02.967
Let's see if we can break into
the Santa network

01:06:02.969 --> 01:06:06.638
and stop from
where they're going.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.607
Oh, God.
It's blocked.

01:06:09.609 --> 01:06:10.241
Oh, boy.

01:06:10.243 --> 01:06:13.446
I need some help
on this one, Maisy.

01:06:14.614 --> 01:06:15.781
Nedry.

01:06:15.783 --> 01:06:17.049
Oh, perfect.

01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:19.618
Please be home.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.087
Please be home.

01:06:21.089 --> 01:06:23.456
Come on. Answer.

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:24.190
Hello.

01:06:24.192 --> 01:06:25.724
Nedry.
Oh, thank goodness.

01:06:25.726 --> 01:06:26.759
I am so glad
you're home.

01:06:26.761 --> 01:06:29.128
Listen, I need your help
with something, okay?

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.497
What is it that you
need this time?

01:06:31.499 --> 01:06:32.698
Look, um,
I need a favor.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.301
Are you on Santa Tracker
10.8.1 right now?

01:06:35.303 --> 01:06:37.236
I've been on it
all night.

01:06:37.238 --> 01:06:38.104
Okay, perfect. Look,

01:06:38.106 --> 01:06:39.972
I really need your help
with something.

01:06:39.974 --> 01:06:42.575
I'm trying to break into
the Santa network

01:06:42.577 --> 01:06:44.344
so that I can help
the sleigh.

01:06:44.346 --> 01:06:45.412
Can you help me
with that?

01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:47.814
Why do you need
to break into the sleigh?

01:06:47.816 --> 01:06:48.949
Look, it's a long story.

01:06:48.951 --> 01:06:50.817
I'll tell you about it later,
but just, please,

01:06:50.819 --> 01:06:54.287
if you'll help me,
I'll owe you big time.

01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:57.891
All righty, but you're
gonna owe me big time.

01:06:57.893 --> 01:07:00.927
Oh, thank you so much.
I appreciate it.

01:07:00.929 --> 01:07:02.929
It's c-cold.

01:07:02.931 --> 01:07:04.097
I want Mommy!

01:07:04.099 --> 01:07:06.933
How are we supposed
to deliver these presents?

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:09.603
How are we
supposed to get home?

01:07:09.605 --> 01:07:11.371
Kittens?

01:07:11.472 --> 01:07:13.674
- Kittens?
- Bramble?

01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:15.143
And Mom?

01:07:15.145 --> 01:07:18.980
Get closer
so he can see you.

01:07:18.982 --> 01:07:19.914
Oh, there you are.

01:07:19.916 --> 01:07:23.584
It's me, Mr. Bramble,
with Maisy, your Mom.

01:07:23.586 --> 01:07:25.986
Look, I need you to listen
and do exactly as I say,

01:07:25.988 --> 01:07:28.022
'cause we're gonna try to
get you back home, okay?

01:07:28.024 --> 01:07:30.791
Now, the sleigh
has backup rockets.

01:07:30.793 --> 01:07:32.360
I can activate them
from here,

01:07:32.362 --> 01:07:35.263
but you're gonna have to do
the steering from the sleigh.

01:07:35.265 --> 01:07:37.265
Think you could do that?

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.033
Rock on!

01:07:39.035 --> 01:07:42.069
Let's go home, Patches.

01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:44.940
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:45.208 --> 01:07:46.475
Hang on!

01:07:46.477 --> 01:07:50.179
Remember,
you have to steer.

01:07:50.847 --> 01:07:54.249
- Whoo- Hoo!
- Oh, no, no. Left.

01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:57.519
- Whoo!
- Whoo- hoo!

01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:01.023
Mom never lets me
have cookies at night.

01:08:01.457 --> 01:08:03.825
Santa, would you
like some cookies?

01:08:03.827 --> 01:08:05.627
A cookie.

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.198
Mmm.

01:08:14.505 --> 01:08:17.740
- Thank you, Tommy.
- You're welcome.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.015
Ohh!

01:08:32.057 --> 01:08:34.657
Are these peanut butter
cookies?!

01:08:34.658 --> 01:08:35.825
Yeah.

01:08:35.827 --> 01:08:40.563
I told you I was allergic
to peanut butter.

01:08:40.564 --> 01:08:41.731
You never said that.

01:08:41.733 --> 01:08:46.437
I said I was
allergic to legumes!

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:47.604
Oh.

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:56.546
I killed Santa!

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.649
Tommy, go grab
the EpiPen.

01:08:58.651 --> 01:08:59.550
It's in
the first-aid kit

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:02.819
in the bottom of the cupboard.
Hurry!

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.426
Okay.

01:09:09.428 --> 01:09:11.060
Santa, hold on.
Hurry!

01:09:11.063 --> 01:09:13.665
Nope. Nope. Nope.

01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:17.469
Santa,
it's gonna be okay.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:18.870
You're gonna
be okay.

01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:20.205
Hurry!

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:26.044
Hurry!
Santa's fading fast!

01:09:26.046 --> 01:09:27.245
Nope. Nope.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:30.148
Hold on, Santa.
It's gonna be okay.

01:09:32.719 --> 01:09:35.185
You look great.

01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:37.656
Hurry!

01:09:37.658 --> 01:09:39.424
Ah. Got it.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:40.859
Tommy, hurry!

01:09:40.861 --> 01:09:43.496
I'm going. I'm going.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:47.366
Found it!
Hurry!

01:09:47.368 --> 01:09:49.335
Whoops.

01:10:07.088 --> 01:10:09.121
You all right?

01:10:09.123 --> 01:10:12.426
Feel like
I won the lotto.

01:10:12.994 --> 01:10:14.461
Oh.

01:10:16.065 --> 01:10:19.333
Thanks for saving Santa.

01:10:19.335 --> 01:10:21.168
Thanks, Tommy.

01:10:22.904 --> 01:10:26.373
Now, that's
Christmas magic.

01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:36.616
Thank you.

01:10:40.722 --> 01:10:42.390
You'd think...

01:10:42.392 --> 01:10:45.793
here's a man that can take...
millions of packages

01:10:45.795 --> 01:10:48.262
around the world
in a night.

01:10:48.264 --> 01:10:50.932
I can't even
drink any water

01:10:50.934 --> 01:10:53.067
or find
my way home.

01:10:53.069 --> 01:10:55.603
It's almost sunrise.

01:11:01.710 --> 01:11:02.944
I can't
believe Bramble

01:11:02.946 --> 01:11:06.581
- is the last name on the list.
-I know, weird, huh?

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:08.282
The sun is rising!

01:11:08.617 --> 01:11:11.453
Hairball, do you see
Bramble's house yet?

01:11:11.455 --> 01:11:13.589
What are you
talking about?

01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:16.191
They all
look the same.

01:11:18.027 --> 01:11:20.129
Kittens better hurry.

01:11:21.498 --> 01:11:24.199
When the last
snowflake falls,

01:11:24.201 --> 01:11:27.069
it's over for the year.

01:11:31.241 --> 01:11:33.475
All right, Maisy.
They're getting close.

01:11:33.477 --> 01:11:36.111
We better
get ready for them.

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:43.753
What's that?

01:11:43.755 --> 01:11:46.689
It sounds
like my sleigh.

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:49.392
This is
Kitty One coming in.

01:11:49.394 --> 01:11:53.029
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

01:11:56.468 --> 01:11:58.735
- Yeah.
- Wait.

01:11:58.737 --> 01:12:01.604
They're going
to Bramble's house!

01:12:03.774 --> 01:12:05.775
And he hates
the kittens!

01:12:05.777 --> 01:12:08.278
Oh, go! Go! Go!

01:12:08.879 --> 01:12:12.550
Whah! You decorated the
outside of the house, too?

01:12:12.552 --> 01:12:15.152
I couldn't
help myself!

01:12:15.154 --> 01:12:17.254
Hurry! Hurry!

01:12:17.256 --> 01:12:18.923
Hurry!

01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.630
Hi, baby. Hi.

01:12:27.934 --> 01:12:29.366
Marcus?

01:12:31.837 --> 01:12:33.971
Mr. Bramble?

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.373
Hey.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:41.279
Uh, this is exactly
what it looks like.

01:12:41.948 --> 01:12:43.748
Marcus, get up.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.117
Come on up, boy.
Come on up.

01:12:48.654 --> 01:12:50.055
Give us
our kittens back.

01:12:50.057 --> 01:12:52.757
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I can explain that.

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:55.560
I can explain. See,
what happened was is I--

01:12:58.265 --> 01:12:59.431
I love you.
-Calm down.

01:12:59.433 --> 01:13:01.132
I found Santa's hat,
and then I found Maisy,

01:13:01.134 --> 01:13:03.835
and Maisy and I, we hacked
into the Santa network.

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:05.570
And we saw the kittens
were on the sleigh,

01:13:05.572 --> 01:13:06.605
and the sleigh was lost,
so we got up,

01:13:06.607 --> 01:13:08.807
and we got into the sleigh
through the GPS,

01:13:08.809 --> 01:13:10.141
and then we redirected
the sleigh back here...

01:13:10.143 --> 01:13:12.512
and then we found the
kittens in here as they're--

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:16.282
They're so cute. Look at 'em.
I love 'em so much.

01:13:16.284 --> 01:13:18.317
- Just the best. I love 'em so much.
- Look at 'em.

01:13:18.319 --> 01:13:20.386
Look at 'em playing
with each other.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:25.858
Sorry.

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.897
What is wrong
with you?

01:13:30.899 --> 01:13:33.633
Do you want, like, a hot
shower or some Vicks?

01:13:33.635 --> 01:13:37.270
No, no, it's the cats.
I'm allergic to 'em.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.915
- Um, can I--
- Sorry.

01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:52.753
I'll be right back.

01:13:53.187 --> 01:13:56.056
Boy, is he a couple
of bricks short.

01:13:57.492 --> 01:13:58.659
Kittens!

01:13:58.661 --> 01:14:02.563
Kittens, you had me
so worried.

01:14:03.431 --> 01:14:05.365
I took care of us, Mom,

01:14:05.367 --> 01:14:07.467
just like
you said we should.

01:14:07.469 --> 01:14:09.803
Oh, kittens,
I know what I said,

01:14:09.805 --> 01:14:11.839
but you are
still my babies.

01:14:11.841 --> 01:14:13.141
Never think
for a second

01:14:13.143 --> 01:14:15.176
that I will ever
not worry about you,

01:14:15.178 --> 01:14:18.613
no matter how strong and
self-sufficient you become.

01:14:18.615 --> 01:14:20.114
I'm your mother.

01:14:20.116 --> 01:14:22.050
I will always worry.

01:14:22.052 --> 01:14:22.917
I love you guys.

01:14:22.919 --> 01:14:24.586
We love you, too, Mom.

01:14:24.588 --> 01:14:25.553
Self-sufficient wha--

01:14:25.555 --> 01:14:28.423
Ah, too many
big words for me.

01:14:28.425 --> 01:14:30.658
Ah, that's nice.

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:33.361
Thank goodness
you guys are okay.

01:14:33.363 --> 01:14:34.429
But what
about Christmas?

01:14:34.431 --> 01:14:37.498
Aren't there still
presents to be delivered?

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.334
You're right.

01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:41.837
Bramble's
the last house.

01:14:41.839 --> 01:14:42.972
Here, Santa.

01:14:42.974 --> 01:14:45.140
Oh, thank you, Tommy.

01:14:45.775 --> 01:14:46.775
But it's empty.

01:14:46.777 --> 01:14:49.445
There aren't
any presents left.

01:14:51.781 --> 01:14:53.148
My magic's gone.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.217
It's completely gone.

01:14:55.219 --> 01:14:57.419
And if I can't deliver
this last present,

01:14:57.421 --> 01:14:59.555
it'll be gone forever.

01:14:59.557 --> 01:15:01.156
We have
to do something!

01:15:01.158 --> 01:15:02.424
- Tommy's right.
- Mm- hmm.

01:15:02.426 --> 01:15:04.593
Christmas just
can't be canceled.

01:15:04.595 --> 01:15:07.630
I thought
you hated Christmas.

01:15:07.632 --> 01:15:09.431
I don't hate Christmas.

01:15:09.433 --> 01:15:12.135
I just--
I didn't believe in it,

01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:17.307
but someone gave me
a reason to believe again.

01:15:17.309 --> 01:15:18.208
Thank you.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:21.712
Does that mean we can celebrate
Christmas next year, too?

01:15:21.714 --> 01:15:24.047
Of course it does.

01:15:24.049 --> 01:15:25.415
Yes.

01:15:25.783 --> 01:15:26.783
But that won't matter

01:15:26.785 --> 01:15:29.419
if we can't deliver
the presents this year.

01:15:30.622 --> 01:15:32.222
Couldn't we
give Mr. Bramble

01:15:32.224 --> 01:15:35.158
cookies or decorations
or something?

01:15:37.696 --> 01:15:39.697
Hey.

01:15:39.699 --> 01:15:41.032
Listen.

01:15:46.071 --> 01:15:48.272
Whoa. Smooth landing.

01:15:48.274 --> 01:15:52.076
Whoa, another
perfect 10, bro.

01:15:52.078 --> 01:15:53.678
High hoof!

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.613
Cool!

01:15:59.251 --> 01:16:03.421
Here, Santa. I think
this belongs to you.

01:16:03.423 --> 01:16:05.122
Yes, it does.

01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:09.728
Thank you, Mr. Bramble.

01:16:10.263 --> 01:16:11.963
Merry Christmas.

01:16:11.965 --> 01:16:13.632
Thanks.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:16.401
Is there anything
I can do to help?

01:16:16.403 --> 01:16:19.771
Help us?
I thought you hated us.

01:16:19.773 --> 01:16:23.275
Besides, you can't give
a present to yourself.

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:25.711
You stopped
talking to me.

01:16:25.713 --> 01:16:27.212
I wanted
to reach out,

01:16:27.214 --> 01:16:30.716
but you never
wanted to talk.

01:16:30.718 --> 01:16:35.153
I even started
following your blog.

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.956
How do you know
about my blog?

01:16:37.958 --> 01:16:40.927
We've been neighbors
since we were little kids.

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.562
Ever since
we stopped talking

01:16:42.564 --> 01:16:44.297
that one Christmas
that we saw Santa

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:47.500
and the other kids were
making fun of us for it,

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:50.837
I hated the fact
that I lost my best friend.

01:16:50.839 --> 01:16:55.174
I connected with you
the only way I knew how.

01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:59.312
I'm sorry
I stopped talking to you.

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:01.047
It's just that...

01:17:01.049 --> 01:17:04.784
it was too painful
to be reminded of.

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.219
Well,
that's why I started

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:09.055
putting all those Santas
in my front yard.

01:17:09.057 --> 01:17:12.860
I figured maybe if you
saw what Christmas was,

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.428
that you would
believe again

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:18.532
and I could have
my best friend back.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:50.932
Santa, are you okay?

01:17:55.938 --> 01:17:57.772
Where did Santa go?

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:01.075
And he didn't
even say goodbye.

01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:02.811
Wait. Wait.
Listen.

01:18:02.813 --> 01:18:06.314
The roof!
Quick! Outside!

01:18:17.127 --> 01:18:19.228
Whoa!

01:18:19.230 --> 01:18:23.132
Yes!

01:18:27.304 --> 01:18:29.471
Tommy, I want
to thank you.

01:18:29.473 --> 01:18:34.009
Without your help, Christmas
could have been ruined forever.

01:18:34.011 --> 01:18:36.645
Glad to help, Santa.

01:18:36.647 --> 01:18:38.647
And you guys.

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:41.117
I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:18:43.321 --> 01:18:45.455
Thanks, Tommy.

01:18:45.923 --> 01:18:51.094
Tommy, tell me what you'd
really like for Christmas.

01:18:52.296 --> 01:18:53.897
Well, what I really want

01:18:53.899 --> 01:18:56.366
is for the kittens
to stay with us,

01:18:56.368 --> 01:19:00.770
but Mom said we can't
take care of them.

01:19:00.772 --> 01:19:03.039
But that's what
I really want.

01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:05.642
And I'll save up
my allowance

01:19:05.644 --> 01:19:06.543
to help pay for them.

01:19:06.545 --> 01:19:08.211
Well,
I'll take the kittens.

01:19:08.213 --> 01:19:09.280
I could use the company,

01:19:09.282 --> 01:19:12.216
and that way, they can see
Maisy anytime they want.

01:19:12.218 --> 01:19:14.886
- Really?
- Really.

01:19:19.358 --> 01:19:21.525
Do you guys
see what I see?

01:19:21.527 --> 01:19:22.827
And this is for you,
little ones.

01:19:22.829 --> 01:19:25.162
Mmm. Is it
my cheeseburger?

01:19:25.164 --> 01:19:26.831
Thanks, guys.

01:19:27.933 --> 01:19:29.767
And here's
a little token

01:19:29.769 --> 01:19:31.936
of my appreciation.

01:19:32.504 --> 01:19:35.840
This is
the coolest thing ever.

01:19:51.357 --> 01:19:53.225
And this is
for you, Tommy.

01:19:53.227 --> 01:19:54.893
Thanks, Santa.

01:19:54.895 --> 01:19:57.129
Merry Christmas.

01:20:03.036 --> 01:20:06.138
I think you know
what this is.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:07.706
Thank you.

01:20:18.852 --> 01:20:21.254
Marcus,
this should help you

01:20:21.256 --> 01:20:23.857
get you in touch
with your inner child.

01:20:23.859 --> 01:20:27.660
And you won't have to wait so long
to get it recharged.

01:20:30.999 --> 01:20:33.499
Heh. Come on.

01:20:36.438 --> 01:20:37.870
Thank you,
Santa.

01:20:37.872 --> 01:20:41.275
Heh. Merry Christmas
to you all.

01:20:44.312 --> 01:20:45.746
I have to go now.

01:20:48.049 --> 01:20:51.185
It's getting
rather late.

01:20:52.053 --> 01:20:53.721
Goodbye.

01:21:03.064 --> 01:21:06.300
Travel patterns
indicate clear weather.

01:21:06.302 --> 01:21:07.902
It'll be smooth sailing

01:21:07.904 --> 01:21:10.839
all the way back
to the North Pole.

01:21:10.841 --> 01:21:12.440
Welcome back, Santa.

01:21:12.442 --> 01:21:14.342
Hello, Tinsel.

01:21:18.147 --> 01:21:19.447
Ho ho ho!

01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:21.816
Merry Christmas!

01:21:24.121 --> 01:21:27.055
Whoa!

01:21:27.057 --> 01:21:30.125
Let's go, dudes!

01:21:35.231 --> 01:21:38.734
Ho ho ho! Merry
Christmas!

01:21:38.736 --> 01:21:42.038
And I didn't even
get a picture of Santa.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.540
Wait. I have an idea.

01:21:45.409 --> 01:21:48.077
Why don't we
take a picture of us?

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:54.683
Everyone say,
"Merry Christmas."

01:21:54.685 --> 01:21:57.520
Merry Christmas.
