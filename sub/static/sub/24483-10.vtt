WEBVTT

00:03.953 --> 00:05.052
I need to get a message to my father,

00:05.087 --> 00:06.687
Jules-Pierre Mao.

00:06.721 --> 00:08.122
Everything you feared
about the protomolecule

00:08.157 --> 00:09.356
has come to pass.

00:09.392 --> 00:10.939
I can't fix it,

00:10.975 --> 00:13.455
but I can destroy the man
who brought you low.

00:14.163 --> 00:15.629
We've struck at the "Inner's" vessels,

00:15.665 --> 00:17.164
and we will strike again.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.833
Holden didn't do any of that.

00:18.868 --> 00:20.601
He's being framed.

00:20.636 --> 00:22.269
That fake message was
somebody trying to kill us.

00:22.305 --> 00:23.627
It was just supposed to be a back door

00:23.662 --> 00:24.719
so we could get nav

00:24.754 --> 00:26.140
and stuff you might not tell us.

00:26.175 --> 00:28.008
We're still locked out
of comms and weapons.

00:28.044 --> 00:30.077
I don't wanna get into
anyone's firing range

00:30.112 --> 00:32.512
until we can explain that
that message was fake.

00:32.548 --> 00:33.907
Make sure you tell them

00:33.942 --> 00:35.347
we didn't blow up the "Seung Un"!

00:35.382 --> 00:37.151
Tell them what really happened, please.

00:40.289 --> 00:43.157
You want to indulge in a selfish desire

00:43.192 --> 00:44.959
to be a part of something amazing.

00:44.994 --> 00:46.126
Yeah.

00:46.162 --> 00:47.728
I'm going through the Ring.

00:47.763 --> 00:51.732
I won't hear your voice...
until I'm back.

00:51.767 --> 00:54.235
Inyalowda go through the Ring,

00:54.270 --> 00:56.170
call it their own.

00:56.205 --> 00:58.806
But a Belter opened it!

00:58.841 --> 01:01.876
This moment belong to us!

01:01.911 --> 01:03.711
It's the MCRN "Xuesen."

01:03.746 --> 01:05.179
If things go too fast around here,

01:05.214 --> 01:06.914
something gets nervous and grabs 'em?

01:06.949 --> 01:08.916
How fast was it going
when it got stopped?

01:08.951 --> 01:10.517
Just over 18,000 KPH.

01:10.553 --> 01:12.086
Okay, so now we have a speed limit.

01:12.121 --> 01:14.488
I came back for the wrong reasons.

01:14.523 --> 01:16.991
I didn't understand what I was leaving.

01:18.427 --> 01:20.087
Don't go too fast out there.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.429
Hang in there. I'm coming.

01:22.465 --> 01:24.164
I've been seeing him
since the Ring turned on.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.866
Maybe he isn't exactly dead.

01:25.902 --> 01:27.701
Maybe he isn't exactly Miller.

01:27.737 --> 01:29.036
We gotta go. Come on.

01:29.071 --> 01:30.671
To the station. To the nucleus.

01:30.706 --> 01:32.006
I got a case to solve,
and you want the truth.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.641
Are you coming or not?

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

02:37.544 --> 02:39.810
Miller told me to go to the station.

02:40.547 --> 02:42.180
He said it would help us.

02:42.215 --> 02:44.746
He's already saved our asses once, so...

02:44.781 --> 02:47.151
I've gotten you guys in enough trouble.

02:47.187 --> 02:48.820
What else is new, right?

02:52.806 --> 02:55.340
I have to do this on my own.

02:55.762 --> 02:58.412
Just stay safe.

02:59.799 --> 03:03.634
Thanks... both of you, for...

03:04.004 --> 03:05.669
well, for everything.

03:10.369 --> 03:13.176
And do not follow me.

03:13.896 --> 03:15.963
That's an order.

03:22.658 --> 03:24.157
Fuck.

03:29.097 --> 03:30.964
After all the shit we've been through,

03:30.999 --> 03:33.333
I'm starting to wonder if I'm cursed.

03:33.368 --> 03:34.467
Yeah, why's that?

03:34.503 --> 03:36.136
'Cause out of the whole human race,

03:36.171 --> 03:39.472
you're the one flying through
the mysterious alien artifact

03:39.508 --> 03:41.841
with a dead guy?

03:41.877 --> 03:44.244
Yeah.

03:44.279 --> 03:46.546
You're just following your program.

03:46.582 --> 03:48.481
- Just like me.
- Program?

03:48.517 --> 03:49.616
- Mm-hmm.
- I always had

03:49.651 --> 03:51.851
this crazy notion about free will.

03:51.887 --> 03:53.587
Then how come it is

03:53.622 --> 03:55.522
that every time there's a cluster-suck

03:55.557 --> 03:57.724
shit-storm situation in the universe,

03:57.759 --> 03:59.326
there's James Holden,

03:59.361 --> 04:00.860
shrugging his shoulders, saying,

04:00.896 --> 04:02.696
"How the hell did I end up here?"

04:02.731 --> 04:04.936
You're really pumping me
up for this mission.

04:05.934 --> 04:09.236
You're the patron saint
of lost causes, kid.

04:09.271 --> 04:10.537
Quit running from it.

04:26.659 --> 04:29.260
Course is locked.

04:29.397 --> 04:31.731
We are on final approach to the Gate.

04:31.766 --> 04:33.566
Sub two is go.

04:40.975 --> 04:45.411
Dr. Volovodov...
I heard you were a Methodist.

04:45.447 --> 04:47.814
- Uh, I am.
- Me too.

04:47.849 --> 04:50.149
First Methodist, Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

04:50.185 --> 04:51.417
- Mm-hmm.
- It's part of

04:51.453 --> 04:53.352
the North American Trade Zone.

04:53.388 --> 04:55.654
We're all a long way from home.

04:56.324 --> 04:58.059
Yeah, a very long way.

04:58.094 --> 04:59.926
All hands, stand by

04:59.961 --> 05:01.827
for zero-G.

05:01.852 --> 05:06.599
As a precaution, speed will be
12,600 kilometers per hour,

05:06.634 --> 05:08.835
30% below the limit.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.376
I haven't been sleeping
very well since...

05:11.411 --> 05:13.206
we got the orders
to go through this thing.

05:13.241 --> 05:15.308
In the face of all this, sleep seems

05:15.343 --> 05:17.801
disrespectful, maybe?

05:18.793 --> 05:22.264
- I'd say more like terrifying.
- Mm-hmm.

05:24.144 --> 05:26.226
Do you think God wants us to be here?

05:27.455 --> 05:29.689
Uh, as far as I can tell,

05:29.724 --> 05:32.258
the scripture's quiet on this one.

05:32.293 --> 05:33.960
Excuse me.

05:37.639 --> 05:41.032
All indicators are green
for Ring transit.

05:42.003 --> 05:45.162
Gate contact in ten...

05:46.040 --> 05:47.080
nine...

05:48.329 --> 05:49.499
eight...

05:50.671 --> 05:51.835
seven...

05:52.934 --> 05:54.171
six...

05:55.196 --> 05:56.465
five...

05:57.485 --> 05:58.800
four...

05:59.734 --> 06:01.094
three...

06:01.809 --> 06:03.138
two...

06:03.758 --> 06:05.098
one.

06:17.615 --> 06:19.337
Transit is complete.

06:19.362 --> 06:21.362
We are on the other side of the Ring.

06:21.699 --> 06:23.866
All work groups report.

06:27.338 --> 06:29.371
And there are the Martians.

06:29.406 --> 06:31.406
This is incredible.

06:31.442 --> 06:33.375
We have to get some probes out ASAP.

06:33.410 --> 06:37.579
Can't we just... enjoy it for a minute?

06:37.615 --> 06:39.481
I suppose we should.

06:41.418 --> 06:43.252
I thought it was gonna be a wormhole.

06:43.287 --> 06:44.998
- It's not?
- In theory,

06:45.034 --> 06:46.955
wormholes connect
distant points in space.

06:46.991 --> 06:49.458
And this doesn't look like space at all.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.943
Exactly. Whatever it is,

06:50.978 --> 06:52.161
it's highly energetic.

06:52.196 --> 06:53.969
Its emissions are swamping our censors.

06:54.005 --> 06:55.364
I think it's beautiful.

06:56.066 --> 06:57.776
There's something at the center.

07:01.639 --> 07:03.272
It looks similar to the Ring.

07:03.307 --> 07:05.107
Makes sense it would be
the same technology.

07:05.142 --> 07:09.545
What are those... those purple glows?

07:09.580 --> 07:11.947
You tell me.

07:11.982 --> 07:14.116
Yeah?

07:22.926 --> 07:24.392
That's the slingshotter.

07:26.830 --> 07:30.165
Belter torpedo... MCRN probe...

07:30.201 --> 07:33.395
in the same orbit,
the same distance apart.

07:34.004 --> 07:36.707
What is this place?

07:36.742 --> 07:40.409
Where angels fear to tread
if they had any goddamn sense.

07:40.444 --> 07:42.311
Sorry, Pastor.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.112
"Rocinante."

07:52.147 --> 07:53.689
Please respond.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.383
"Rocinante," please respond.

08:06.637 --> 08:09.357
Come on, guys.

08:09.392 --> 08:11.891
Why aren't you talking?

08:13.711 --> 08:16.245
Belter skiff, this is the MCRN "Xuesen."

08:16.280 --> 08:18.648
What is your business?

08:19.483 --> 08:21.750
I am en route to the "Rocinante."

08:21.785 --> 08:24.237
Have you contacted them?

08:24.955 --> 08:26.622
This is a policing action.

08:26.657 --> 08:27.856
We have been ordered to apprehend

08:27.891 --> 08:29.291
James Holden and crew.

08:29.326 --> 08:32.628
Your assistance is neither
requested nor required.

08:32.663 --> 08:35.697
You can't possibly believe
that the same James Holden

08:35.732 --> 08:38.589
who saved Mars has started blowing up

08:38.625 --> 08:40.501
innocent civilian ships?

08:40.537 --> 08:42.703
We are ordering you to break off.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.306
You have been fairly warned.

08:44.341 --> 08:46.742
- "Xuesen" out.
- Same to you.

08:47.477 --> 08:48.609
Asshole.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.249
"Drop Ship One," this is "Flight."

08:54.285 --> 08:57.386
Stand by for final clearance to drop.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.591
Whoever that is, they're headed straight

09:02.626 --> 09:04.159
for that thing in the center.

09:04.194 --> 09:05.661
It has to be Holden.

09:05.696 --> 09:07.396
That's definitely his style.

09:07.431 --> 09:08.830
- So he's crazy?
- I suppose you could

09:08.866 --> 09:10.799
- make that argument.
- Fantastic.

09:10.834 --> 09:12.601
But I don't believe he
would blow up the "Seung Un."

09:12.636 --> 09:14.801
That's definitely not his style.

09:14.836 --> 09:16.471
You sure you're up for this, Gunny?

09:16.507 --> 09:18.173
What do you mean by that?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.242
The things Holden did
in the war with your help...

09:20.277 --> 09:22.010
that's a big part of why
you were reinstated.

09:22.046 --> 09:24.913
It'd be understandable
if you were feeling conflicted.

09:24.948 --> 09:26.114
Our orders are to stop him

09:26.150 --> 09:28.183
before he does anything down there,

09:28.218 --> 09:31.320
and that's what I intend to do.

09:40.230 --> 09:42.664
Are you gonna tell me what that thing is?

09:42.700 --> 09:43.865
Yeah, just as soon as we get down there,

09:43.901 --> 09:44.966
we'll both know.

09:45.002 --> 09:46.201
I should've brought a gun.

09:46.236 --> 09:47.235
Wouldn't do you any good.

09:47.271 --> 09:49.171
I calmed down the station's security.

09:49.206 --> 09:50.839
That's about the only thing
protecting you right now.

09:50.874 --> 09:52.474
Mm, comforting.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.286
Except these guys.
We got a little company.

09:58.716 --> 10:01.616
Ugh, Martians.

10:01.652 --> 10:04.766
- They're not happy with me.
- Just collecting pals

10:04.802 --> 10:07.622
wherever you go, huh?

10:07.658 --> 10:11.159
- What are you doing?
- Trying not to get caught.

10:11.195 --> 10:12.627
Slow down. Remember what I said

10:12.663 --> 10:13.995
- about doors and corners?
- Don't start with

10:14.031 --> 10:15.998
- with that shit again.
- Hey, you're no good to me

10:16.034 --> 10:17.532
if the station squashes you like a bug!

10:17.568 --> 10:21.203
Slow down.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.313
Just exercising some free will.

10:31.348 --> 10:33.908
Now you're just being an asshole.

10:45.734 --> 10:48.536
Amos. Amos!

10:48.572 --> 10:50.705
Looks like the "Xuesen"
just launched a skiff.

10:50.740 --> 10:52.707
They're going after Holden.

10:52.742 --> 10:54.375
Then we have to go after him too.

10:54.411 --> 10:56.144
We can't. Even if we left right now

10:56.179 --> 10:57.979
at maximum speed, we wouldn't get

10:58.014 --> 10:59.280
- to him before they did.
- And they're not

10:59.316 --> 11:00.826
gonna be expecting us to try,
so we're going to

11:00.861 --> 11:02.758
punch them in the face
before they figure it out.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.152
Right, that's a... that's a great plan,

11:04.177 --> 11:06.332
to take on a Martian Marine fire team.

11:07.182 --> 11:09.615
It's better to go down
swinging than rolling over.

11:09.651 --> 11:12.752
Why are you being so much like yourself?

11:12.787 --> 11:14.531
Is none of this stuff weirding you out?

11:14.567 --> 11:16.522
You want me to say
this is some weird shit?

11:16.558 --> 11:19.576
- Yeah, this is some weird shit.
- Thank you.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.450
And we're playing
way out of our league, here.

11:21.485 --> 11:23.563
That's been true ever since
we've been sharpening sticks

11:23.598 --> 11:26.933
and going after lions,
but we're still here.

11:26.968 --> 11:28.825
I get it. Alien shit,

11:28.860 --> 11:30.903
magic gates... Naomi bugging off

11:30.939 --> 11:34.010
to go play Belter, Holden doing...

11:35.410 --> 11:37.210
I have no clue what Holden is doing.

11:37.245 --> 11:38.945
Me neither.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.947
I wish that I could tell you
I was freaked out,

11:40.982 --> 11:43.353
but... I'm not.

11:43.389 --> 11:45.117
Not even a little?

11:45.153 --> 11:48.483
I haven't felt fear
since I was five years old.

11:49.157 --> 11:50.914
Man, I wish I could go through life

11:50.949 --> 11:53.655
- without feeling fear.
- No.

11:54.062 --> 11:55.328
You don't.

11:59.434 --> 12:02.568
Brother... I... I can't stop

12:02.604 --> 12:04.870
thinking that being in this place,

12:04.906 --> 12:07.873
that maybe this is it.
Like, we're all gonna die.

12:07.909 --> 12:09.875
We are gonna die.

12:09.911 --> 12:12.378
No. All of us.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.158
Humanity.

12:17.252 --> 12:19.986
Back in Baltimore, I had this friend.

12:20.021 --> 12:22.121
And she said, if the end ever came,

12:22.156 --> 12:24.156
she'd grab a bottle and her two cats

12:24.192 --> 12:25.591
and go to the roof,

12:25.627 --> 12:28.127
have a toast, and then jump.

12:28.162 --> 12:29.629
With the cats?

12:29.664 --> 12:32.798
Like a freakin' pharaoh.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.267
Don't worry.

12:34.302 --> 12:36.364
I'd take you with me too.

12:39.707 --> 12:42.441
My best guess is that
it's a field that manipulates

12:42.477 --> 12:44.844
inertia in ways that we don't understand.

12:44.879 --> 12:46.579
Inertia. That's the whole bodies

12:46.614 --> 12:48.874
- in motion and rest thing?
- Yes.

12:48.909 --> 12:51.484
I feel like there's
a sex joke in there somewhere,

12:51.519 --> 12:53.452
but I'm not finding it.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.954
What's interesting is that
the torpedo's engine

12:54.989 --> 12:56.522
is still burning,
and that the probe's still

12:56.557 --> 12:58.624
- sending back data.
- Why is that interesting?

12:58.660 --> 13:00.092
Well, it means that
their internal systems

13:00.128 --> 13:01.694
are still functioning normally,

13:01.729 --> 13:03.329
even though the objects
themselves have been stopped.

13:03.364 --> 13:06.762
I bet that if an object
were to exceed the speed limit

13:06.797 --> 13:09.502
inside this ship,
nothing would happen to it.

13:09.537 --> 13:11.566
We should test that.

13:12.974 --> 13:16.542
Maybe the purple glow is like a cyst.

13:16.577 --> 13:18.811
- I don't follow.
- When you get a splinter,

13:18.846 --> 13:21.347
your body builds around it,
isolating it...

13:21.382 --> 13:23.883
infections can develop cysts.

13:23.918 --> 13:27.620
Maybe it's interpreting
these objects as threats,

13:27.655 --> 13:30.222
and that's how it isolates them.

13:30.258 --> 13:31.724
There's no way to know
why it's doing anything.

13:31.759 --> 13:33.292
Best we can figure out is how.

13:33.328 --> 13:34.860
I don't think biological models are gonna

13:34.896 --> 13:36.772
- help us understand this.
- Kinda makes you nervous

13:36.807 --> 13:37.977
to think that it's alive

13:38.012 --> 13:40.099
and watching us, don't you think?

13:40.134 --> 13:42.096
Little bit, yeah.

13:43.104 --> 13:44.670
- What is it?
- The XO would like

13:44.706 --> 13:46.072
to speak with you
on the command deck, ma'am.

13:53.247 --> 13:54.847
Lieutenant?

13:54.882 --> 13:57.049
You okay?

13:57.085 --> 13:58.905
Just fine, ma'am.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.816
Show the "Rocinante's" course.

14:34.389 --> 14:36.355
Show best route to intercept
with the "Rocinante"...

14:36.391 --> 14:37.690
within the speed limit.

14:37.725 --> 14:39.529
I need to get there before the "Xuesen."

15:04.752 --> 15:07.119
Support ships for the Inners,

15:07.155 --> 15:09.722
coming to join the party. No matter.

15:09.757 --> 15:11.090
We'll reach the thing in the middle

15:11.125 --> 15:13.893
- before they do.
- And then what?

15:13.928 --> 15:16.829
Knock politely? Rub it with a cloth?

15:18.666 --> 15:21.167
Oh, and it's just too bad we
don't have our chief engineer

15:21.202 --> 15:24.203
to build us some probes.

15:26.641 --> 15:28.564
You have something to say?

15:28.600 --> 15:31.577
Yeah, I said it. We needed Nagata here,

15:31.612 --> 15:33.779
- and you let her go.
- This isn't a slave ship.

15:33.815 --> 15:38.117
No, it's a warship.
The Belt's first and only.

15:38.152 --> 15:39.797
And I'm its captain.

15:43.224 --> 15:46.137
Yeah. Yeah, you are.

15:50.298 --> 15:52.865
We have a few autonomous farm drones

15:52.900 --> 15:55.000
with chemical samplers for soil.

15:55.036 --> 15:57.002
We can convert those into probes.

15:58.573 --> 16:00.606
A captain must know their ship.

16:02.977 --> 16:04.143
Hmm.

16:11.052 --> 16:12.384
I repeat, we are ordering you

16:12.420 --> 16:14.053
to break off your present course

16:14.088 --> 16:15.387
so we can bring you aboard
in protective custody.

16:15.423 --> 16:17.723
You will not be harmed.

16:19.093 --> 16:20.893
James Holden, please respond.

16:22.330 --> 16:25.297
- Shit!
- He's not slowing down.

16:25.333 --> 16:26.799
- Not even a bit.
- He's still got

16:26.834 --> 16:28.567
a ton of velocity to shed,
unless he's planning

16:28.603 --> 16:30.402
on going through that thing
instead of to it.

16:30.438 --> 16:31.470
What do you think's gonna
happen when he reaches it?

16:31.506 --> 16:33.506
Maybe little green men'll come out.

16:33.541 --> 16:34.945
Maybe boom...

16:34.981 --> 16:36.709
Hopefully nothing.

16:36.744 --> 16:39.044
Sir, may I give it a try?

16:40.915 --> 16:43.115
Do it.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.653
Holden. Bobbie Draper here.

16:49.423 --> 16:51.536
Really?

16:52.126 --> 16:54.413
Yeah. It's me.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.161
I need you to slow down.

16:56.197 --> 16:58.330
Shut the hell up, I'm trying to...

16:58.366 --> 17:00.466
sorry, Bobbie, I wasn't talking to you.

17:03.905 --> 17:05.503
Are you on another channel?

17:05.540 --> 17:07.071
What? No.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.108
I... I mean yes. Yes, another channel.

17:09.143 --> 17:10.608
- Would you just stop for...
- Who are you talking to,

17:10.643 --> 17:12.306
Holden?

17:12.713 --> 17:15.214
Monkeys and microwaves?

17:15.249 --> 17:17.016
Holden, are you all right?

17:17.050 --> 17:18.851
- Exactly.
- Holden.

17:18.886 --> 17:21.252
You need to slow down
and let us bring you in.

17:21.289 --> 17:22.387
- Give me a minute...
- I promise we'll

17:22.423 --> 17:23.803
- hear you out.
- I didn't blow up

17:23.838 --> 17:25.624
the "Seung Un," and Alex and Amos

17:25.660 --> 17:26.892
had nothing to do with it either.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.794
I gotta go.

17:28.829 --> 17:30.362
Get him back.

17:30.398 --> 17:32.031
I can't.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.799
He's locked us out of his comms.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.968
That man sound rational to you?

17:36.003 --> 17:38.082
Not entirely.

17:40.274 --> 17:42.575
No, sir. He did not.

17:42.610 --> 17:45.277
Yeah, I concur.

17:45.313 --> 17:46.645
He's cracked.

17:46.681 --> 17:48.647
Everyone's got a breaking point.

17:48.683 --> 17:51.383
I'm sure he's not the only one
in this godforsaken place.

18:21.649 --> 18:23.649
What are you waiting for?

18:23.684 --> 18:26.085
- What's in there?
- Just stuff.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.954
The next lead in the case.

18:28.990 --> 18:32.470
Do you even know what "the case" is?

18:33.127 --> 18:35.794
Yeah, sure. It's, uh...

18:35.830 --> 18:37.496
we gotta find a records room.

18:37.531 --> 18:40.289
And then we gotta read the files.

18:40.324 --> 18:41.896
And then...

18:42.703 --> 18:45.441
we see what's what.

18:46.207 --> 18:49.341
You tell me what that is,
and I'll keep going.

18:53.714 --> 18:56.315
Whew. Sometimes I...

18:56.350 --> 18:58.621
I know stuff that's too big for my head.

19:00.855 --> 19:03.956
There used to be, uh... something here.

19:03.991 --> 19:07.226
A lot of something.
A, uh... civilization...

19:07.261 --> 19:09.795
billions of years ago. But now,

19:09.830 --> 19:12.031
all that's left is a bunch
of locked doors

19:12.066 --> 19:15.134
- and some lights on a timer.
- So what do we do?

19:15.169 --> 19:17.036
You figure out how to pick the locks.

19:19.373 --> 19:21.874
- Ah, they're getting closer.
- Can't you stop them?

19:21.909 --> 19:23.575
Sure, I can get the station
to stop them permanently.

19:23.611 --> 19:24.927
No. No, no.

19:24.962 --> 19:27.212
- Don't do that.
- Hmm.

19:27.248 --> 19:28.981
Then keep moving.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.423
Jules-Pierre Mao's project wreaked havoc

20:52.448 --> 20:54.048
throughout the system. The Protomolecule

20:54.083 --> 20:56.609
killed so many, brought Earth
and Mars to the brink

20:56.644 --> 20:58.719
of annihilation,
and you had a major effect

20:58.755 --> 21:01.114
on those events,
and that led you to this.

21:01.115 --> 21:02.381
The Ring.

21:02.416 --> 21:03.715
How does that make you feel?

21:03.751 --> 21:05.247
Kind of makes me want a donut.

21:18.432 --> 21:20.399
Show me the "Rocinante's" new course.

21:24.305 --> 21:25.571
If I took a skiff,

21:25.606 --> 21:27.806
could I get to the "Rocinante"
before the Martians?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.999
If the "Rocinante's" reactor
went critical,

21:35.024 --> 21:37.591
what would the zero-survival radius be?

21:47.074 --> 21:48.807
Bossmang...

21:51.465 --> 21:53.799
Yeah, what's up?
What's the problem, Harari?

21:53.834 --> 21:56.401
I na like da ting Drummer say to you...

21:56.437 --> 21:57.967
or how she say it.

21:59.473 --> 22:01.306
Uh... a captain can run their ship

22:01.342 --> 22:03.139
however they choose to.

22:03.303 --> 22:05.503
Captain should be you.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.950
Tread carefully, good my boy.

22:11.986 --> 22:13.652
You been bossmang from da time before me

22:13.687 --> 22:15.420
or half the Beltalowda
on this ship was born.

22:15.456 --> 22:17.456
Yeah, that's true. I have.

22:17.491 --> 22:19.291
And I've drunk real Earth whiskey

22:19.326 --> 22:22.861
out of a UN Admiral's mug
and then scuttled her ship.

22:22.897 --> 22:25.330
I flew dark past a Martian battle group,

22:25.366 --> 22:27.966
and they never even knew I was there.

22:28.002 --> 22:31.436
And I've seen friends breathe the vacuum

22:31.472 --> 22:34.172
and watched my only child burn.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.475
So when I tell you to tread carefully,

22:36.510 --> 22:38.977
you would do well to stop talking.

22:56.664 --> 22:58.630
Is this some kind of machine?

22:58.666 --> 23:00.532
Yeah.

23:00.568 --> 23:02.534
Oh, and I need you to do
something for me later.

23:02.570 --> 23:04.636
Not sure what I can do that you can't.

23:04.672 --> 23:07.039
Hmm? Oh, I need you to... you know,

23:07.074 --> 23:08.657
help me get the system back online.

23:08.693 --> 23:11.209
I thought you were
plugged in to this place.

23:11.245 --> 23:13.545
Yeah, but not to the records.
See, they're locked.

23:13.581 --> 23:16.448
Remember? So you can, you know,

23:16.483 --> 23:18.329
- turn the key.
- But what do you need me for?

23:18.364 --> 23:21.053
Because you exist, okay? That's why.

23:21.088 --> 23:22.843
You seem real enough.

23:25.526 --> 23:27.559
Okay.

23:27.595 --> 23:30.495
Couple hundred billion
brain cells in your skull.

23:30.531 --> 23:33.630
You got more synapses
than stars in the universe.

23:33.665 --> 23:36.535
- You are a fancy hand terminal.
- Thanks.

23:36.570 --> 23:38.737
With a lot of buttons.
Now, I push a few trillion

23:38.772 --> 23:41.840
of them buttons in exactly
the right way and, ta-da.

23:41.875 --> 23:43.473
You're talking to Miller.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.410
The sound of his voice,
the clothes he wore.

23:45.446 --> 23:47.325
- Plus the hat.
- Yeah, I like the hat.

23:47.361 --> 23:50.415
Plus, uh, I'm pushing the buttons.

23:50.416 --> 23:51.816
So it's a magic trick.

23:51.851 --> 23:54.218
So is your whole damn reality, kid.

23:54.253 --> 23:56.587
Just different buttons being pushed.

23:56.622 --> 23:58.489
Maybe I'm the illusion inside your head.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.394
I'm trying to keep things
simple here for you, okay?

24:03.429 --> 24:06.230
Calculus, amoeba.

24:06.265 --> 24:08.699
Monkey, Mozart.

24:12.171 --> 24:13.904
You have to pick one or the other.

24:13.940 --> 24:15.639
I don't think that there is a conflict.

24:15.675 --> 24:20.044
My father used to say
that God gave us two texts:

24:20.079 --> 24:22.113
scripture and creation.

24:22.148 --> 24:24.582
And if they seem to contradict,

24:24.617 --> 24:27.284
it's because we haven't
understood one of them yet.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.120
- Enlightened attitude.
- Earlier

24:29.155 --> 24:30.654
than the Enlightenment, actually.

24:30.690 --> 24:33.357
It turns out, he was quoting
St. Augustine.

24:33.393 --> 24:35.291
Excuse me, ma'am.

24:36.529 --> 24:39.096
Sorry to interrupt,
but I have a favor to ask.

24:39.132 --> 24:41.365
One of our crew has passed.
I understand you were

24:41.401 --> 24:42.967
of the same faith. Would you be willing

24:43.002 --> 24:44.168
to say a few words at his service?

24:44.203 --> 24:46.036
Of course. Who is it?

24:46.072 --> 24:48.339
Lieutenant Jordaan Nemeroff.

24:50.810 --> 24:52.443
What happened?

24:52.478 --> 24:53.811
He was cleaning his sidearm

24:53.846 --> 24:56.180
and accidentally discharged the weapon.

24:56.215 --> 24:58.022
Thank you, ma'am.

24:59.051 --> 25:01.275
That's just terrible.

25:02.388 --> 25:06.524
It's a terrible euphemism... actually.

25:06.559 --> 25:07.958
Excuse me.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.940
Supply Master.

25:22.975 --> 25:25.876
I need access to a mech suit
rated for deck work.

25:25.912 --> 25:28.012
- Reason?
- Jammed access hatch.

25:28.047 --> 25:30.581
Gonna have to cut it out.
Name is Koh, K-O-H, Melba.

25:30.616 --> 25:32.082
Got it. Stand by.

25:32.118 --> 25:34.308
Checking your contract.

25:35.421 --> 25:38.255
Sorry, Melba Koh, you are
not authorized for that.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.157
You will need a supervisor to approve...

25:41.761 --> 25:45.162
"...that I didn't know him
when he was ali... "... no.

25:45.198 --> 25:47.164
Sorry I ditched you.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.533
The XO keeps trying to
limit our access privileges.

25:49.569 --> 25:51.368
If I'd known blackmail
was going to be this tedious,

25:51.404 --> 25:53.410
I'd have done something else.

25:54.440 --> 25:57.039
You look grim. Who died?

25:57.944 --> 26:00.211
Oh, shit. Did somebody die?

26:00.246 --> 26:02.847
An officer who tried to talk
with me during the transit.

26:02.882 --> 26:07.117
He was... scared, and I was so...

26:07.153 --> 26:12.623
I... ignored him,
and... he killed himself.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.925
Jesus. I'm sorry.

26:14.961 --> 26:17.695
- Hey, it's not your fault.
- Well...

26:17.730 --> 26:22.299
he was begging for help, and...
I was too distracted.

26:22.335 --> 26:24.101
That's completely understandable.

26:24.136 --> 26:26.203
We've had some pretty
unprecedented distractions.

26:26.239 --> 26:29.573
I should've been more focused
on why I'm here.

26:29.609 --> 26:31.709
- What do you mean?
- I'm not a scientist.

26:31.744 --> 26:32.977
I'm a minister.

26:33.012 --> 26:35.145
Physics, biology, alien artifacts...

26:35.181 --> 26:37.871
I wanna know all about them, but...

26:38.417 --> 26:39.817
that's not my job.

26:39.852 --> 26:41.452
You're not here to praise the Lord.

26:41.487 --> 26:43.821
No, I'm here to talk to people,

26:43.856 --> 26:46.156
to offer comfort where comfort is needed,

26:46.192 --> 26:49.894
to sit with people
when they're... scared...

26:49.929 --> 26:51.962
and grieving.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.732
That is what a minister
is supposed to do.

27:04.644 --> 27:06.043
Sorry.

27:07.980 --> 27:09.313
Clarissa?

27:16.656 --> 27:18.122
That portal opened just as Holden

27:18.157 --> 27:19.690
was getting close to the surface.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.358
Maybe he's controlling
that thing somehow...

27:21.394 --> 27:22.693
You can't seriously
believe he's controlling...

27:22.728 --> 27:24.295
It opened for him. You saw it.

27:24.330 --> 27:26.030
Look, I don't know what
he's going to do down there,

27:26.065 --> 27:28.899
but I got a bad feeling he's
not gonna come with us quietly.

27:28.935 --> 27:30.834
I want you to take us in
and get as close to that portal

27:30.870 --> 27:32.536
- as fast as you can.
- Without going over the limit.

27:32.572 --> 27:34.204
No freaking shit, Trepp. That's SOP,

27:34.240 --> 27:35.806
- and it's understood.
- Copy, LT.

27:35.841 --> 27:37.608
Minimum duration braking burn.

27:37.643 --> 27:40.511
Get ready for some pretty
heavy Gs, marines.

27:40.546 --> 27:41.745
Lids on and load up.

27:54.904 --> 27:57.940
I didn't know Jordaan
as well as many of you

27:57.975 --> 28:01.243
who worked with him
and lived at his side.

28:01.278 --> 28:04.246
I only spoke with him a few times, and...

28:04.281 --> 28:08.170
I regret... that I didn't
know him better.

28:10.054 --> 28:12.754
During the transit, Jordaan asked me

28:12.790 --> 28:18.093
if I thought God wanted us to be here.

28:18.129 --> 28:21.130
I... I didn't know the answer then,

28:21.165 --> 28:23.932
and I don't know it now.

28:23.968 --> 28:30.606
What I do believe is that God
wants us to be together,

28:30.641 --> 28:33.142
to care for each other.

28:33.177 --> 28:37.946
"Where two or three gather
together in my name,

28:37.982 --> 28:40.382
there my spirit is also."

28:40.417 --> 28:43.552
We can't know all of the burdens

28:43.587 --> 28:45.541
that Jordaan carried.

28:46.190 --> 28:49.391
He isn't here anymore to ask.

28:49.426 --> 28:53.862
But... we can remember him

28:53.898 --> 28:57.499
and the shared burdens
that we all carry now.

28:57.535 --> 29:01.670
And... we can treat each other gently,

29:01.705 --> 29:05.140
reach out to those in need.

29:05.176 --> 29:09.311
It will increase our joy
and diminish our pain,

29:09.346 --> 29:14.516
and... it will honor Jordaan.

29:17.221 --> 29:18.615
Thank you.

29:20.591 --> 29:21.623
Thank you so much.

29:23.294 --> 29:25.494
Thank you.

29:25.529 --> 29:27.663
Of course.

29:27.698 --> 29:29.398
I didn't expect to see you here.

29:29.433 --> 29:32.504
- Me neither.
- Thank you for coming.

29:33.370 --> 29:35.237
You're very good at that...

29:35.272 --> 29:38.051
reaching out to people in pain.

29:39.610 --> 29:42.077
You look preoccupied.

29:42.112 --> 29:44.947
I think I just saw someone
who didn't wanna be seen.

29:44.982 --> 29:47.049
I don't understand.

29:47.084 --> 29:49.284
When Jules Pierre-Mao became
public enemy number one,

29:49.320 --> 29:52.020
he took his whole family down with him.

29:52.056 --> 29:53.956
All of their assets were frozen,

29:53.991 --> 29:56.558
several of his family members
were detained and interrogated.

29:56.594 --> 29:58.360
I heard something about that.

29:58.395 --> 30:00.596
Well, a few of them managed to disappear.

30:00.631 --> 30:02.464
There were rumors that
they were hiding out

30:02.499 --> 30:04.866
in the backwaters of the solar system.

30:04.902 --> 30:06.969
You think one of them is here now?

30:07.004 --> 30:09.204
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.106
Jules-Pierre Mao's daughter, Clarissa.

30:11.141 --> 30:12.941
She was disguised as a service tech.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.277
I was gonna call security, but...

30:15.312 --> 30:17.946
I was social with Clarissa... a little.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.482
Look, our fathers are cut
from the same cloth.

30:20.517 --> 30:22.150
If she's on the run because of him,

30:22.186 --> 30:24.152
I don't want to be responsible
for making it worse.

30:24.188 --> 30:26.555
Are you going to reach out to her?

30:26.590 --> 30:28.757
- You think I should?
- I think you should do

30:28.792 --> 30:32.127
what you think is right.
You can trust your judgment.

30:32.162 --> 30:35.130
You obviously don't know me very well.

30:42.339 --> 30:44.826
You might wanna slow down now.

31:01.125 --> 31:03.592
This feels like one-G.

31:03.627 --> 31:05.127
Yeah, you're welcome.

31:05.162 --> 31:07.629
You got atmosphere too.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.893
Take your hat off. Show some respect.

31:12.903 --> 31:15.003
I'll pass.

31:30.988 --> 31:33.822
This is what I need you to do.

31:33.857 --> 31:36.503
Complete that circuit.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.162
What happens when I do?

31:42.666 --> 31:45.734
The answer to the case...

31:45.769 --> 31:49.004
or... maybe just the next clue.

31:53.844 --> 31:57.846
What? Tick-tock, tick-tock.

31:57.881 --> 31:59.815
Finish the job.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.447
Is Miller in there...

32:46.296 --> 32:49.498
or just a heap of Protomolecule
pushing my buttons?

32:49.533 --> 32:51.032
You're running out of time, kid.

32:51.068 --> 32:52.621
Not good enough.

32:53.771 --> 32:56.571
When Miller was on Eros,
he could feel Julie.

32:56.607 --> 32:58.106
It's got nothing to do with Julie.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.375
Fuck you, then. For all I know,

33:00.411 --> 33:01.977
touching that thing could end up

33:02.012 --> 33:04.246
killing everyone I love...

33:04.281 --> 33:06.882
the same people she died to save.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.451
No risk, no reward.

33:11.755 --> 33:14.189
You died together.

33:14.224 --> 33:17.058
But she was already gone, wasn't she?

33:17.094 --> 33:19.981
She couldn't feel
any more pain, but you could.

33:20.597 --> 33:22.067
Did it kill you?

33:22.699 --> 33:25.534
Did it tear you apart,
one atom at a time?

33:28.138 --> 33:29.604
Or did you burn?

33:34.611 --> 33:36.678
Miller?

33:36.713 --> 33:37.746
Miller!

33:52.462 --> 33:53.890
Captain.

33:55.232 --> 33:56.865
Come to check up on me?

33:56.901 --> 33:59.001
Well, you have been down here a while.

33:59.036 --> 34:02.315
I thought I'd do this
until I could keep my temper...

34:03.019 --> 34:05.653
though I am getting a lot done.

34:05.910 --> 34:08.744
I should thank you for that.

34:08.779 --> 34:12.047
I understand why you let Nagata go.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.016
If I had a chief engineer
who didn't want to be here,

34:15.052 --> 34:18.219
I wouldn't want them around, either.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.121
But she was your friend.

34:20.157 --> 34:22.918
She is my friend.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.860
No, I always treated my friends harder...

34:25.896 --> 34:30.364
harsher, to show the crew
I wasn't playing favorites...

34:30.400 --> 34:32.734
even if I was.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.938
You just can't stop
giving me advice, can you?

34:35.973 --> 34:38.407
- I'm trying to help you.
- Yet, still you call me out

34:38.442 --> 34:40.943
in front of the crew.

34:40.978 --> 34:43.145
Yeah, I could've done that better.

34:43.179 --> 34:48.216
You did what you meant.
You put it in everyone's head.

34:48.252 --> 34:52.554
And after I left, I bet you
were all praise for me, yeah?

34:52.589 --> 34:55.056
How important it is
to respect the captain

34:55.092 --> 34:56.992
and so on. That way, when the turn come

34:57.027 --> 34:59.197
and you take over, they all know it was

34:59.232 --> 35:02.709
because you had to. No choice.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.000
Oh, we have a problem.

35:05.035 --> 35:07.069
And we need to work it out.

35:07.104 --> 35:09.504
Or else what?

35:21.185 --> 35:22.784
Clarissa?

35:29.360 --> 35:31.893
It's Tilly. Tilly Fagan.

35:31.929 --> 35:35.200
I was friends with your sister,
Julie, a little.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.827
You have me confused with someone else.

35:40.037 --> 35:41.603
No, I don't.

35:47.745 --> 35:48.918
How did you find me?

35:48.953 --> 35:50.033
There's not that many

35:50.069 --> 35:52.014
civilian contractors on the ship.

35:52.049 --> 35:54.549
It wasn't hard,
once I knew where to look.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.639
I want to help you.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.222
Help me?

36:00.257 --> 36:02.657
I can help you set things straight.

36:02.693 --> 36:04.359
I'll get you in touch with my lawyer.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.961
Whatever your dad did or didn't do,

36:05.996 --> 36:07.863
you had nothing to do with any of it.

36:07.898 --> 36:08.997
It's not his fault. It's Holden's.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.443
He's gotta pay.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.302
Clarissa, whatever happened,

36:14.338 --> 36:15.971
you have no reason
to be suffering for it.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.783
Julie told me this crazy kid's story.

36:37.728 --> 36:39.347
She said...

36:41.932 --> 36:44.132
when a child dies...

36:44.168 --> 36:47.355
some sort of angel...

36:47.871 --> 36:51.151
takes their hand and falls...

36:51.642 --> 36:54.446
halfway, you know, so they...

36:56.280 --> 36:58.241
wouldn't be afraid.

36:59.850 --> 37:01.953
I tried to be the angel.

37:02.986 --> 37:06.855
But I was... so scared.

37:11.962 --> 37:13.673
So...

37:14.598 --> 37:16.885
she held my hand.

37:20.137 --> 37:21.973
And I told her...

37:23.574 --> 37:25.769
"If you fall with me...

37:28.011 --> 37:30.607
it ain't gonna be for halfway."

37:33.917 --> 37:36.237
It's good to see you, Miller.

37:41.398 --> 37:42.864
Holden.

37:44.628 --> 37:47.195
- Holden, stay where you are.
- You stay where you are.

37:47.297 --> 37:48.897
Get the hell out of here, Bobbie.

37:48.932 --> 37:51.066
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- Listen to me.

37:51.101 --> 37:53.268
- We just wanna talk to you.
- I didn't blow up

37:53.303 --> 37:55.403
the "Seung Un."
- I never believed you did.

37:56.874 --> 37:58.974
Come with us and we'll figure it all out.

37:59.009 --> 38:01.576
I can't. I have to do this.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.246
There's no way to explain,
but you gotta trust me, please.

38:04.281 --> 38:07.916
Think about Amos. Alex.

38:07.951 --> 38:09.951
Think about Naomi.

38:09.987 --> 38:11.753
You're putting them all in danger.

38:11.788 --> 38:14.222
If you really care about
them, come with us.

38:16.860 --> 38:18.793
- Do not take another step...
- Holden.

38:18.829 --> 38:20.896
Or we will shoot.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.432
It doesn't wanna hurt us.

38:47.991 --> 38:49.991
What the hell?

38:50.027 --> 38:51.793
Grenade!

39:32.665 --> 39:34.532
Now or never, Holden.

39:34.567 --> 39:35.933
Finish it.
