WEBVTT

00:11.893 --> 00:13.761
WHERE IS THE REMOTE?

00:15.431 --> 00:17.865
HEY, REMOTE!
COME HERE, BOY.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.900
NO REMOTE. CARRIE!

00:19.968 --> 00:22.670
WHERE'D YOU PUT THE REMOTE?!

00:24.440 --> 00:26.374
AH, HERE YOU ARE,
YOU LITTLE SCAMP.

00:26.442 --> 00:29.244
AHH. YEAH.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.881
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:42.284 --> 01:44.769
SCRATCH JUST ABOVE
MY LEFT BUTTOCK.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.491
COUPLE THINGS-

01:49.558 --> 01:51.292
UH, YOU DIDN'T SAY
PLEASE,

01:51.360 --> 01:53.528
AND I'D RATHER DIE.

01:53.595 --> 01:54.862
DAMN IT,

01:54.930 --> 01:57.281
THIS RASH IS TORTURE,
AND IT'S IN A SPOT

01:57.349 --> 01:59.383
I JUST CAN'T REACH.

02:01.470 --> 02:03.304
HEY, HEY, COME ON.
DON'T USE THAT.

02:03.372 --> 02:04.756
I HAVE TO.
IT'S THE ONLY UTENSIL

02:04.823 --> 02:07.158
THAT FEELS REMOTELY
LIKE HUMAN FINGERS.

02:07.225 --> 02:10.578
SO... YOU'VE TRIED THEM ALL?

02:10.645 --> 02:13.464
AT VARIOUS TIMES
OVER THE YEARS, YES.

02:28.780 --> 02:30.765
OK, SORRY
TO KEEP BUGGING YOU,

02:30.833 --> 02:32.550
BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF
THIS OUTFIT FOR MY INTERVIEW?

02:32.618 --> 02:33.951
DO WE HAVE A WINNER?

02:34.019 --> 02:35.904
IT'S NICE, IT'S NICE.
BUT HOW ABOUT AN OUTFIT

02:35.971 --> 02:38.306
THAT SHOWS OFF
A LITTLE MORE...

02:38.373 --> 02:40.608
BOOBAGE?

02:40.676 --> 02:41.826
DOUG, COME ON.
I WANT TO GET THIS JOB

02:41.894 --> 02:43.495
ON MY QUALIFICATIONS.
AND I'LL TELL YOU,

02:43.562 --> 02:46.364
I HAVE A REALLY GOOD FEELING
ABOUT THIS ONE.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.299
YOU KNOW, THE HEAD
OF THE DUGAN GROUP

02:48.367 --> 02:49.984
LEGAL DEPARTMENT
CALLED ME PERSONALLY

02:50.051 --> 02:50.985
TO CONFIRM THE INTERVIEW.

02:51.052 --> 02:52.720
HE WENT ON AND ON
ABOUT MY RESUME,

02:52.788 --> 02:54.689
MY LETTERS
OF RECOMMENDATION.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.691
I MEAN, HE PRACTICALLY
GAVE ME THE JOB

02:56.759 --> 02:57.958
ON THE PHONE.

02:58.026 --> 02:59.994
YEAH, BUT JUST
TO BE SAFE...

03:03.348 --> 03:04.649
DARLING, MY FRIEND MICKEY
JUST GAVE ME THE NAME

03:04.717 --> 03:06.618
OF HIS DERMATOLOGIST
IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.853
PLEASE TAKE ME THERE
IMMEDIATELY.

03:08.921 --> 03:10.021
DAD, THAT COULDN'T
BE LESS POSSIBLE.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.257
I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW
IN 2 HOURS.

03:12.324 --> 03:14.058
I UNDERSTAND.

03:14.126 --> 03:17.312
DOUGLAS, LET'S ROLL.

03:17.379 --> 03:18.513
I CAN'T. I GOT
THE CABLE GUY COMING.

03:18.580 --> 03:20.665
IF I MISS HIM THIS TIME,
I GOTTA WAIT ANOTHER MONTH.

03:20.733 --> 03:21.783
BUT MY HAUNCHES
ARE ON FIRE.

03:21.850 --> 03:23.551
DOES THAT MEAN
NOTHING TO YOU?

03:23.619 --> 03:26.171
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD,

03:26.238 --> 03:28.306
DR. MANDELBAUM'S OFFICE IS
ON THE WAY TO MY INTERVIEW.

03:28.373 --> 03:29.957
IF YOU'RE THAT UNCOMFORTABLE,
I WILL DROP YOU OFF

03:30.025 --> 03:32.343
AND PICK YOU UP
WHEN I AM DONE, OK?

03:32.411 --> 03:33.161
WHY, SO HE CAN
JUST GIVE ME SOME MORE

03:33.228 --> 03:35.680
OF HIS OVERPRICED OINTMENT?
NO DICE!

03:35.748 --> 03:38.649
I WANT TO SEE MICKEY'S
DERMATOLOGIST. MICKEY SWEARS BY HIM!

03:38.717 --> 03:40.285
MICKEY HAS MORE SPOTS
ON HIS FACE

03:40.353 --> 03:42.520
THAN A CHEETAH, OK?

03:42.588 --> 03:43.988
IT'S MANDELBAUM
OR NOBODY.

03:44.056 --> 03:45.923
NOW YOU'VE GOT 5 MINUTES
TO GET DRESSED.

03:45.991 --> 03:47.275
FINE.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.866
MS. HEFFERNAN?
YES.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.034
MR. HECHT IS JUST
FINISHING UP A CALL

03:56.102 --> 03:57.102
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

03:57.169 --> 03:59.104
HE'LL BE READY FOR YOU
IN A FEW MOMENTS.

03:59.171 --> 04:01.706
OK. THANK YOU.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.477
I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO ANGRY!

04:06.545 --> 04:08.262
SHH! DAD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:08.330 --> 04:09.931
I TOLD YOU TO WAIT FOR ME
AT MANDELBAUM'S.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.232
I COULDN'T VERY WELL
WAIT IN THE OFFICE

04:11.300 --> 04:13.668
OF A MAN I'M NOW SUING, COULD I? WHAT?!

04:13.736 --> 04:16.019
THAT CHARLATAN TOOK ONE
LITTLE PEEK AT MY RASH

04:16.088 --> 04:17.622
AND TOLD ME TO KEEP
USING THE OINTMENT.

04:17.689 --> 04:19.656
I GRABBED MY FILE
OUT OF HIS HANDS,

04:19.725 --> 04:20.658
KICKED OVER
HIS CACTUS,

04:20.726 --> 04:22.426
AND RAN
LIKE THE DICKENS!

04:22.494 --> 04:23.194
SHH!

04:23.262 --> 04:25.029
MS. HEFFERNAN?
HE'S READY.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.164
OH, OK. THANK YOU.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.032
YOUNG LADY,
WHICH OF YOUR LAWYERS

04:28.100 --> 04:29.901
SPECIALIZES
IN DERMATOLOGY SCAMS?

04:29.969 --> 04:31.469
HA HA HA HA.
HE'S KIDDING.

04:31.537 --> 04:34.805
COME ON. YEAH.

04:34.873 --> 04:35.790
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME, YOU.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.659
UNTIL MY INTERVIEW IS OVER,
YOU WILL SIT THERE

04:37.760 --> 04:39.928
AND SPEAK AND MAKE EYE CONTACT
WITH NO ONE.

04:39.995 --> 04:41.445
BUT I-
NO ONE!

04:41.513 --> 04:44.299
NOW SIT DOWN. SIT.

04:44.366 --> 04:46.033
AND STAY.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.689
ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE WAY WE OPERATE

04:51.757 --> 04:53.024
AND WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
BEEN USED TO IS THAT,

04:53.091 --> 04:55.793
SINCE THIS A REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPMENT FIRM,

04:55.861 --> 04:56.928
THE LAWYERS AREN'T
RUNNING THE SHOW,

04:56.995 --> 04:58.095
UNFORTUNATELY.

04:58.163 --> 04:59.463
RIGHT, RIGHT.

04:59.531 --> 05:01.799
WE COULD BE GOING IN ONE
DIRECTION ON A PROJECT,

05:01.867 --> 05:03.401
AND THEN THE DEVELOPMENT
GUYS PULL SOMETHING

05:03.469 --> 05:05.236
AND WE HAVE TO DO
A 180 OVERNIGHT.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.206
WELL, ACTUALLY, WHAT I
CONSIDER ONE OF MY STRENGTHS

05:08.273 --> 05:10.258
AS AN ASSISTANT
IS I KEEP MY OWN

05:10.325 --> 05:12.961
CROSS-REFERENCED FILES
ON ALL THE...

05:13.028 --> 05:17.048
CASES MY BOSS
IS WORKING ON,

05:17.116 --> 05:21.753
SO IF THINGS CHANGE
SUDDENLY, I CAN, UH...

05:21.820 --> 05:23.788
YOU CAN WHAT?

05:23.856 --> 05:24.772
UH...

05:26.742 --> 05:28.342
SO, OFTEN YOU
MIGHT BE CALLED ON

05:28.410 --> 05:30.044
TO ASSIST ONE OF
OUR SENIOR ATTORNEYS

05:30.112 --> 05:32.881
AT CITY HEARINGS,
NEGOTIATIONS, AND SO FORTH.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.999
OH, WELL, THAT'S VERY EXCITING
NEWS, BECAUSE AT MY OLD FIRM

05:35.067 --> 05:37.101
THERE WAS REALLY
NEVER AN OPPORTUNITY TO-

05:42.741 --> 05:45.743
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN,
SO IF I'M REQUIRED

05:45.811 --> 05:47.645
TO STAY LATE
OR GO OUT OF TOWN,

05:47.713 --> 05:49.480
THAT DOESN'T
REALLY PRESENT A-

05:50.499 --> 05:51.882
A PROBLEM-

05:51.950 --> 05:54.235
IN-IN THE SENSE
THAT I WOULD GIVE

05:54.303 --> 05:56.020
MY TOTAL FOCUS TO-

05:56.088 --> 05:59.390
JUST ONE SECOND.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.277
EXCUSE ME.

06:03.345 --> 06:04.779
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:04.847 --> 06:06.448
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

06:06.515 --> 06:08.449
HE ASKED ME IF
I WAS BEING HELPED.

06:08.517 --> 06:10.250
DAMN IT, I HAVE
A LAWSUIT TO FILE!

06:10.318 --> 06:12.987
SHH! DAD, THESE ARE
REAL ESTATE LAWYERS, OK?

06:13.054 --> 06:14.622
THEY DON'T
REPRESENT LUNATICS

06:14.690 --> 06:16.156
WHO WANT TO SUE
THEIR DERMATOLOGIST!

06:16.224 --> 06:18.026
THEY ALL MOONLIGHT.
GROW UP. GOOD SIR-

06:18.093 --> 06:19.711
NO, DAD, COME HERE.
GIVE ME THE FILE.

06:19.778 --> 06:21.178
JUST STOP
AND KNOCK IT OFF.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.347
GIVE IT-
NO! NO!

06:22.414 --> 06:24.081
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?!

06:27.802 --> 06:29.771
ONE MORE SEC.

06:34.993 --> 06:37.528
IT'S FUNNY.
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

06:37.596 --> 06:39.730
EVER SINCE
IT WENT OUT, I...

06:39.798 --> 06:42.133
KEEP WALKING BY AND
GRABBING FOR THAT REMOTE

06:42.201 --> 06:44.835
AND FLICKING IT ON
AND...

06:44.903 --> 06:47.121
THAT STATIC COMES UP.

06:47.189 --> 06:48.857
I KEEP DOING IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

06:48.924 --> 06:50.758
YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE I FORGET.

06:50.826 --> 06:53.528
THAT'S THE THING WITH
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

06:53.596 --> 06:57.265
YOU JUST FORGET.

06:57.332 --> 06:59.100
I'VE HAD IT WITH HIM, DOUG!
I'VE JUST HAD IT!

06:59.167 --> 07:01.569
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:01.637 --> 07:02.837
I HAD THE JOB.
I COULD FEEL IT.

07:02.905 --> 07:05.206
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
GET THROUGH THE INTERVIEW

07:05.273 --> 07:07.208
WITHOUT ACTING
LIKE A MENTAL PATIENT.

07:07.275 --> 07:09.243
WELL, GUESS WHO TOOK CARE
OF THAT FOR ME?!

07:09.311 --> 07:10.478
OH, PLEASE.
I DIDN'T COME NEAR

07:10.545 --> 07:11.746
HER PRECIOUS INTERVIEW.

07:11.813 --> 07:13.882
I WAS CONDUCTING
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION,

07:13.949 --> 07:15.649
AND SHE INTERRUPTED ME!

07:15.717 --> 07:18.402
HE SHOWED A STRANGER
HIS ASS.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.805
THE TOP OF MY ASS!

07:20.872 --> 07:22.307
SHOULD I COME BACK
ANOTHER TIME?

07:22.374 --> 07:23.224
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.642
THIS IS JUST
PLAYFUL BANTER.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.144
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH HIS ASS?

07:26.211 --> 07:27.978
IT DOESN'T MATTER, OK?

07:28.046 --> 07:29.279
THE POINT IS
I HAD A SHOT

07:29.347 --> 07:30.581
AT SOMETHING GOOD
IN MY LIFE,

07:30.649 --> 07:34.318
AND ONCE AGAIN MY FATHER
STOMPED IT INTO DUST!

07:34.385 --> 07:35.836
AND HERE COME
THE MELODRAMATICS!

07:35.904 --> 07:36.970
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:37.038 --> 07:38.622
GO TO HELL.

07:38.690 --> 07:41.959
SURE, EVERYTHING
IS MY FAULT!

07:42.027 --> 07:43.094
WERE IT NOT FOR ME,
YOU'D BE MARRIED

07:43.162 --> 07:46.797
TO THE PRINCE OF MONACO
AND LIVING IN HIS CASTLE!

07:46.865 --> 07:49.250
MAYBE I REALLY
SHOULD LEAVE.

07:49.317 --> 07:51.869
NO, NO, NO. LOOK, IT'S
OVER. IT'S ALL OVER.

07:51.937 --> 07:53.137
YOU KNOW,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

07:53.205 --> 07:54.738
CRAP.

07:54.806 --> 07:57.241
I DIDN'T WANT TO MARRY
THE PRINCE OF MONACO.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.810
I DID WANT TO WIN
THAT JUNIOR SPELLING BEE.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.110
YOU REMEMBER THAT, HUH?

08:00.178 --> 08:01.111
INDEED I DO.

08:01.179 --> 08:02.346
REALLY? 'CAUSE I
WOULD HAVE WON THAT

08:02.414 --> 08:03.747
HAD YOU
NOT SHOUTED OUT

08:03.816 --> 08:05.499
HOW TO SPELL
THE WORD VESTIBULE

08:05.567 --> 08:07.451
WHILE I WAS
THINKING OF IT!

08:07.519 --> 08:08.202
I HAD TO SHOUT.

08:08.270 --> 08:11.222
YOU KEPT IGNORING
MY HAND SIGNALS!

08:11.290 --> 08:13.724
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I WANTED?
I WANTED TO PERFORM

08:13.792 --> 08:16.593
<i>IN THE SEVENTH GRADE
PERFORMANCE OF SWAN LAKE,</i>

08:16.661 --> 08:19.647
NOT BE YANKED OUT OF THE
AUDITORIUM IN MY LEOTARD

08:19.715 --> 08:21.048
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO GIVE YOU

08:21.116 --> 08:23.818
"V.I.P. SEATING."

08:23.885 --> 08:25.586
THE OTHER SWANS' PARENTS
WERE IN THE FRONT ROW.

08:25.654 --> 08:27.121
SHOULD I HAVE IGNORED THAT?

08:27.188 --> 08:29.239
YES, YEAH, YEAH, YOU SHOULD
HAVE IGNORED THAT BECAUSE-

08:29.307 --> 08:31.976
NOW I KNOW THIS IS A HARD
CONCEPT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND-

08:32.044 --> 08:34.912
THAT NIGHT
WASN'T ABOUT YOU.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.947
OH, THIS IS STUPID.
IT'S JUST ANCIENT HISTORY.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.268
OH, OK, YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY, THEN?

08:40.336 --> 08:42.503
I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE
GOTTEN THAT SECRETARY JOB,

08:42.571 --> 08:44.288
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULD'VE LIKED MORE?

08:44.356 --> 08:47.575
NOT HAVING TO GROVEL
FOR A SECRETARY JOB AT ALL.

08:47.643 --> 08:49.276
BUT THAT WOULD HAVE
MEANT ME GOING TO COLLEGE,

08:49.344 --> 08:50.878
AND I DIDN'T GO
TO COLLEGE, DID I?

08:50.946 --> 08:53.514
NO. I BECAME A CHECKER
AT WALDBAUM'S.

08:53.582 --> 08:56.617
WHY, BECAUSE SOMEBODY SAID
I WOULD BE ABANDONING HIM.

08:56.685 --> 08:57.785
YOUR MOTHER
HAD JUST DIED!

08:57.852 --> 08:59.453
MY LIFE
WAS IN UPHEAVAL!

08:59.521 --> 09:02.523
SO WAS MINE.
NEWS FLASH, OK?

09:02.590 --> 09:03.590
YOU WERE NEVER THERE
FOR ME, DAD.

09:03.659 --> 09:05.926
YOU NEVER-YOU NEVER ARE,
YOU NEVER WERE.

09:05.994 --> 09:07.928
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
WHEN I WAS SITTING THERE

09:07.996 --> 09:09.229
TRYING TO HOLD
THAT INTERVIEW TOGETHER

09:09.297 --> 09:10.430
AND I WAS LOOKING
THROUGH THAT GLASS,

09:10.498 --> 09:11.431
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW?

09:11.499 --> 09:13.934
WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING
MY WHOLE LIFE:

09:14.002 --> 09:15.269
A LOUSY FATHER.

09:15.336 --> 09:17.488
A SELFISH,
OVERBEARING,

09:17.556 --> 09:19.157
LOUSY FATHER!

09:25.747 --> 09:29.016
DID I OFFER YOU
A SODA YET?

09:29.083 --> 09:30.735
I GOTTA GO.

09:36.241 --> 09:39.310
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.580
NOTHING YOU CAN SAY,
NOTHING YOU CAN DO.

09:42.647 --> 09:44.048
UNLESS YOU CAN
GO BACK IN TIME

09:44.116 --> 09:45.716
AND FIX EVERYTHING.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.400
HELLO?

10:05.203 --> 10:06.536
OH. UH-HUH.

10:08.039 --> 10:10.775
OK. THANK YOU.

10:13.544 --> 10:15.880
I GOT THE JOB.

10:15.947 --> 10:18.366
UM...

10:18.433 --> 10:21.468
YAY?

10:27.225 --> 10:28.926
HEY, ANY SIGN
OF MY DAD?

10:28.994 --> 10:30.661
NOPE.
I THOUGHT I SAW HIM

10:30.728 --> 10:31.895
IN THE PARK,
BUT IT TURNED OUT

10:31.963 --> 10:33.964
TO BE JUST
A WEIRD-SHAPED KID.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.133
OHH. WHY COULDN'T
THAT STUPID PHONE CALL

10:36.201 --> 10:38.235
HAVE COME
5 MINUTES EARLIER?

10:38.303 --> 10:40.738
THEN I NEVER WOULD'VE
GONE OFF ON HIM LIKE THAT.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.807
HOW BAD WAS IT?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.443
IT WASN'T THAT BAD.
IT REALLY WASN'T.

10:45.510 --> 10:46.693
DOUG, DON'T LIE TO ME.
HOW BAD WAS IT?

10:46.761 --> 10:48.429
IT WAS THE WORST
THING I EVER SAW.

10:48.497 --> 10:50.030
AND I ONCE SAW A GUY
CHASE HIS GLASS EYE

10:50.098 --> 10:53.667
DOWN A FLIGHT
OF SUBWAY STAIRS.

10:53.735 --> 10:56.921
OH, THIS IS AWFUL!

10:56.988 --> 10:57.922
LOOK, IT'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

10:57.989 --> 10:59.623
NO, IT'S NOT GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT, DOUG.

10:59.691 --> 11:01.892
I MEAN, THERE
ARE THINGS IN LIFE

11:01.960 --> 11:03.460
YOU JUST DON'T SAY OUT LOUD,
AND I SAID 'EM.

11:03.528 --> 11:06.497
I CALLED THE MAN
A LOUSY FATHER.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.198
I DID SAY THAT, RIGHT?

11:08.266 --> 11:09.033
TWICE.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.385
THE SECOND TIME,
YOU KIND OF SPIT ON HIM.

11:13.288 --> 11:14.288
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

11:14.355 --> 11:16.023
YOUR DAD'S AT MY PLACE.

11:16.090 --> 11:17.642
OH, GOOD. HOW IS HE?

11:17.709 --> 11:18.409
WELL, HE SEEMS PRETTY UPSET.

11:18.476 --> 11:19.627
HE SAID
HE'S NOT COMING HOME

11:19.695 --> 11:22.763
UNTIL HE FIGURES OUT A WAY
TO GO BACK IN TIME,

11:22.831 --> 11:24.064
WHICH HAS ME
A LITTLE WORRIED,

11:24.133 --> 11:26.800
'CAUSE I'M HAVING
PEOPLE OVER TONIGHT.

11:26.868 --> 11:29.086
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:29.153 --> 11:30.688
GO TALK TO HIM, HONEY.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.690
ME?

11:32.758 --> 11:34.425
YEAH, PLEASE.
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW

11:34.493 --> 11:36.093
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM
RIGHT NOW.

11:36.160 --> 11:36.894
YOU JUST TELL HIM
YOU GOT THE JOB

11:36.962 --> 11:38.312
AND EVERYTHING'LL
BE FINE.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.047
DOUG, I DON'T THINK
THE JOB NEWS WILL OFFSET

11:40.115 --> 11:42.049
THE "I HATE YOU" NEWS.

11:42.117 --> 11:44.151
I GOT NOTHING
TO SAY TO HIM.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.987
YEAH, BUT SOMEONE'S
GONNA TALK TO HIM, RIGHT?

11:47.055 --> 11:49.357
'CAUSE I HAVE A LOT
OF JELL-O SHOTS TO MAKE.

11:51.843 --> 11:52.776
FINE. ALL RIGHT, FINE.

11:52.844 --> 11:53.911
I WILL DO IT.

11:53.978 --> 11:55.429
THANK YOU, HONEY.
I LOVE YOU.

11:55.497 --> 11:58.032
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO TAKE
A WALK AND CLEAR MY HEAD.

11:58.099 --> 11:59.600
OK. I HAVE NO TV,

11:59.668 --> 12:00.835
AND NOW I'M
ABOUT TO BEG ARTHUR

12:00.902 --> 12:02.169
TO COME BACK HOME.

12:02.237 --> 12:03.270
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'D BETTER DRIVE.

12:03.338 --> 12:05.389
I MIGHT TAKE US
OFF A BRIDGE.

12:16.084 --> 12:18.753
HEY, ARTHUR.
I'M BACK.

12:18.820 --> 12:20.087
I BROUGHT DOUG.

12:20.155 --> 12:22.623
HOWDY.

12:22.691 --> 12:24.591
SO, THIS IS MY PLACE.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.193
WOW. VERY NICE.

12:26.261 --> 12:28.362
VERY, VERY NICE.

12:28.429 --> 12:29.813
GOOD VIEW
OF THE EXPRESSWAY.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.951
GREAT VIEW, ACTUALLY.

12:34.018 --> 12:35.519
YEAH, AND AFTER A WHILE,
THE TRAFFIC NOISE

12:35.587 --> 12:37.321
STARTS TO SOUND
LIKE THE OCEAN.

12:37.389 --> 12:39.523
WOW, ANOTHER PLUS
RIGHT THERE.

12:40.592 --> 12:41.758
OH.

12:41.826 --> 12:45.112
SO, ARTHUR,
HOW'S IT GOING?

12:45.180 --> 12:47.481
HOW'S, UH-
HOW'S YOUR RASH?

12:47.549 --> 12:48.566
MUCH BETTER.

12:48.717 --> 12:52.319
TURNS OUT MANDELBAUM'S
OINTMENT WORKS AFTER ALL.

12:52.387 --> 12:53.971
GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.455
NOW IF THERE WERE ONLY
SOME SORT OF OINTMENT

12:55.524 --> 12:57.691
FOR FAILING AS A PARENT.

12:57.759 --> 13:00.377
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU FAILED AS A PARENT.

13:00.445 --> 13:03.314
YOU GOT, LIKE,
A C-MINUS MAYBE.

13:03.381 --> 13:04.581
WHICH, IN MY HOUSE,
WAS GOOD ENOUGH

13:04.649 --> 13:06.951
TO EARN YOU
A TRIP TO CARVEL.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.085
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK YOU SHOULD COME HOME,

13:08.152 --> 13:09.386
SIT DOWN WITH CARRIE,
YOU TALK THIS OUT.

13:09.454 --> 13:10.488
DAMN IT, DOUGLAS,

13:10.555 --> 13:12.723
TALKING WON'T FIX
WHAT I'VE DONE TO HER.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.424
THE LOST FRIENDS,
THE BROKEN DREAMS,

13:14.493 --> 13:16.126
THAT JOB TODAY.
YOU HEARD HER,

13:16.194 --> 13:18.228
I CAN'T FIX IT UNLESS
I GO BACK IN TIME.

13:18.296 --> 13:20.064
AND UNLESS YOU'RE
INCREDIBLY WEALTHY,

13:20.132 --> 13:22.399
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.301
I KNOW, BUT
YOU GOTTA COME HOME.

13:24.369 --> 13:25.669
I WILL NOT
COME HOME AGAIN!

13:25.737 --> 13:28.706
THIS IS MY HOME NOW!

13:28.773 --> 13:30.524
NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE CANNOT LIVE HERE.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.494
I ALREADY AM NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE CAT.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.862
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK I GOT AN IDEA HERE, OK?

13:35.930 --> 13:36.763
HEY, ARTHUR,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

13:36.831 --> 13:38.215
I THINK I MAY
HAVE FIGURED A WAY

13:38.282 --> 13:39.517
YOU CAN GO BACK IN TIME

13:39.584 --> 13:41.552
AND ACTUALLY FIX
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.153
HOW?

13:43.221 --> 13:44.722
JUST CALL THE GUY
DOWN AT THE DUGAN GROUP

13:44.790 --> 13:47.457
AND APOLOGIZE FOR MESSING UP
CARRIE'S INTERVIEW.

13:47.525 --> 13:48.726
AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE
HE'LL CHANGE HIS MIND

13:48.794 --> 13:50.260
AND HIRE HER AFTER ALL.

13:50.328 --> 13:51.628
YOU REALLY THINK
THAT WILL WORK?

13:51.897 --> 13:52.630
YOU NEVER KNOW
UNLESS YOU TRY.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.148
OK, WE'LL GIVE YOU
SOME PRIVACY.

13:54.216 --> 13:55.199
YEAH, OK?

13:55.267 --> 13:56.567
WHAT'S THIS MAN'S NAME
AGAIN?

13:56.635 --> 13:59.337
UH, IT'S, UH... LANCE.

13:59.404 --> 14:01.873
UH... BOSSINGTON.

14:01.940 --> 14:02.974
GOT IT!

14:05.794 --> 14:09.930
YES, MAY I SPEAK WITH
LANCE BOSSINGTON, PLEASE?

14:09.998 --> 14:11.782
MR. BOSSINGTON?

14:11.850 --> 14:13.517
PLEASE
HOLD THE LINE, SIR.

14:15.937 --> 14:17.905
BOSSINGTON HERE.

14:17.972 --> 14:20.541
YES, I DO REMEMBER
YOU, MR. SPOONER.

14:20.609 --> 14:22.042
AS I RECALL, YOU
AND YOUR DAUGHTER

14:22.110 --> 14:24.111
MADE QUITE
A RUCKUS HERE.

14:24.179 --> 14:25.546
MM-HMM.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.098
SO, WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
WAS ENTIRELY MY FAULT, SIR.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.835
I TRULY WISH YOU WOULD
RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION.

14:31.903 --> 14:33.236
YOU WILL?

14:33.304 --> 14:34.254
OF COURSE I WILL.

14:34.322 --> 14:38.258
YOU'RE A VERY PERSUASIVE
MAN, MR. SPOONER.

14:38.326 --> 14:39.477
WHY, IT'S ALMOST AS IF
YOU'VE GONE BACK IN TIME

14:39.544 --> 14:43.614
AND MADE THINGS
RIGHT. REMARKABLE!

14:43.682 --> 14:45.966
SHUT YOUR TRAP
OUT HERE!

14:46.034 --> 14:47.267
UH, LOOK...

14:47.335 --> 14:49.686
I'VE GOT TO RUN INTO A BIG
REAL ESTATE MEETING NOW.

14:49.754 --> 14:53.524
I'M TRADING IN
4 HOUSES FOR A HOTEL.

14:53.591 --> 14:54.624
GOOD-BYE.

14:54.692 --> 14:56.043
Nice.

14:58.112 --> 15:00.331
ANY LUCK?
IT WORKED!

15:00.398 --> 15:02.366
WOW. CARRIE'S GONNA BE
HAPPY TO HEAR THAT, HUH?

15:02.434 --> 15:03.734
GOOD JOB, ARTIE.

15:03.801 --> 15:06.604
IT ACTUALLY IS POSSIBLE
TO FIX THE PAST.

15:06.671 --> 15:07.737
YOU PROVED THAT.
DIDN'T HE?

15:07.805 --> 15:10.006
MM-HMM.
HERE'S YOUR JACKET.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.775
OH, NO.
I CAN'T GO HOME YET.

15:11.843 --> 15:13.660
I'VE GOT
MANY MORE CALLS TO MAKE,

15:13.728 --> 15:15.862
MANY MORE WRONGS
TO RIGHT.

15:15.930 --> 15:17.781
ARTHUR, YOU GOT CARRIE
THE JOB. THAT'S ENOUGH!

15:17.849 --> 15:19.016
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
I WON'T LEAVE

15:19.083 --> 15:20.350
UNTIL I'VE FIXED
EVERYTHING.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.220
BECAUSE
NOW I KNOW I CAN!

15:25.690 --> 15:26.940
OK.

15:27.008 --> 15:28.875
NOW, EACH OF THE NUMBERS
WE GAVE TO ARTHUR

15:28.943 --> 15:30.877
CORRESPONDS TO ONE
OF THESE CELL PHONES.

15:30.945 --> 15:33.581
LIKE, WHEN THIS ONE
RINGS, FOR EXAMPLE,

15:33.648 --> 15:34.715
ARTHUR'S GONNA THINK
HE'S CALLING THE WOMAN

15:34.783 --> 15:36.917
WHO WAS CARRIE'S
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PRINCIPAL,

15:36.985 --> 15:39.452
BUT, IN FACT,
IT'LL ACTUALLY BE YOU.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.654
OK, NOW, LIKE WHEN
THIS ONE RINGS HERE,

15:40.722 --> 15:41.655
HE THINKS
HE'S GONNA BE CALLING

15:41.723 --> 15:43.190
CARRIE'S
HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND.

15:43.258 --> 15:45.442
THAT'LL BE ME.
AND SO ON.

15:45.510 --> 15:47.261
SO, I'LL
BE ALL THE WOMEN,

15:47.329 --> 15:49.163
AND YOU'LL
BE ALL THE MEN?

15:49.231 --> 15:52.866
I THINK THAT'S BEST.

15:54.252 --> 15:57.221
YOU'RE UP.
OK, MAKE ME PROUD,

15:57.289 --> 15:59.489
MISS HANRATTY.

15:59.557 --> 16:00.874
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

16:00.942 --> 16:04.695
THAT CARRIE ACTUALLY KNEW
HOW TO SPELL VESTIBULE.

16:04.762 --> 16:07.231
YES, SHE SPELLED IT
FOR ME ON A REGULAR BASIS.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.699
IF I HADN'T SHOUTED IT OUT,

16:08.766 --> 16:10.467
SHE WOULD
HAVE WON FOR SURE.

16:10.535 --> 16:12.769
WELL, IN THAT CASE, I SHOULD
GO BACK INTO THE RECORDS

16:12.838 --> 16:15.372
AND MAKE HER THE WINNER,
SHOULDN'T I?

16:15.440 --> 16:17.641
THAT WOULD BE MARVELOUS!

16:17.709 --> 16:19.710
OF COURSE I FORGIVE YOU.

16:19.777 --> 16:20.978
IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME

16:21.046 --> 16:23.247
<i>WE DO THE SEVENTH GRADE
PRODUCTION OF SWAN LAKE,</i>

16:23.315 --> 16:26.550
I KNOW WHO OUR SPECIAL
GUEST BALLERINA'S GONNA BE.

16:26.617 --> 16:29.320
CARRIE SPOONER!

16:31.622 --> 16:33.157
SURE, MR. S.,

16:33.225 --> 16:35.125
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

16:35.193 --> 16:37.194
CARRIE IS ONCE AGAIN
MY FAVORITE GIRLFRIEND

16:37.261 --> 16:38.995
FROM ALL OF HIGH SCHOOL.

16:39.063 --> 16:41.198
YOU'RE A PRINCE, PETER.

16:41.266 --> 16:43.183
YOU'VE ACTUALLY MADE ME
FEEL QUITE FOOLISH

16:43.251 --> 16:45.719
FOR CUTTING SHORT YOUR
ROMANCE WITH MY DAUGHTER.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.989
WELL, I'M SURE SHE DID
PRETTY WELL FOR HERSELF.

16:49.057 --> 16:51.575
OH, YES, SHE'S MARRIED
TO A VERY NICE FELLOW.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.178
THOUGH, FRANKLY,
HE IS A BIT OF A SIMPLETON.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.013
AND I GET
THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION

16:56.081 --> 16:57.148
THAT IN THE BEDROOM,

16:57.215 --> 17:00.351
HE'S SKITTISH, CLUMSY,
AND TENTATIVE.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.553
TOP THAT OFF WITH
HIS ATROCIOUS HEALTH HABITS,

17:02.620 --> 17:04.155
AND IT'S QUITE A MESS
OVER THERE.

17:04.222 --> 17:05.556
HANG IN THERE, PETER.

17:05.623 --> 17:07.558
YOU MAY JUST
GET ANOTHER CHANCE!

17:09.327 --> 17:11.178
HOW'D THAT GO?

17:11.246 --> 17:13.480
IT WAS GOOD.
IT'S FINE, FINE.

17:13.548 --> 17:15.214
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPOONERS.

17:15.282 --> 17:16.650
I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING CLEAN

17:16.717 --> 17:18.018
ON THAT 11th ITEM.

17:18.086 --> 17:21.255
CARRIE'S WELCOME BACK IN
MY EXPRESS LINE WHENEVERS.

17:23.258 --> 17:26.160
A LITTLE RACIST,
BUT DID THE TRICK.

17:26.227 --> 17:27.644
OK, WE GOT ONE MORE HERE.
UH, LET'S SEE.

17:27.712 --> 17:30.747
OK, MARTIN SYZNICK.

17:30.815 --> 17:31.765
HEY, LISTEN, SINCE
THE LAST ONE IS A MAN,

17:31.917 --> 17:32.849
DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE OFF

17:32.918 --> 17:34.151
AND GET READY
FOR MY PARTY?

17:34.219 --> 17:35.485
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GO AHEAD.
I'LL HANDLE THE CALL,

17:35.553 --> 17:36.653
THEN I'LL COME
PICK UP ARTHUR.

17:36.721 --> 17:40.090
GREAT, GREAT. I'LL
LEAVE HIM ON THE STOOP!

17:42.760 --> 17:45.495
HELLO?

17:45.563 --> 17:48.832
YES, SIR. I'M TRYING TO
REACH A MARILYN SYZNICK.

17:50.001 --> 17:51.668
MARILYN?

17:51.736 --> 17:53.536
Oh, my God.
It does say Marilyn.

17:57.292 --> 17:59.359
YES, MY SISTER MARILYN
JUST GOT OUT OF THE SHOWER.

17:59.427 --> 18:01.161
PLEASE HOLD A SECOND.

18:03.931 --> 18:05.199
HEY, LOOK, I NEED
YOUR HELP, ALL RIGHT?

18:05.266 --> 18:06.333
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

18:06.401 --> 18:07.551
OH, GOOD, OK.

18:07.652 --> 18:09.270
TELL HIM
TO GO TO HELL.

18:09.337 --> 18:10.687
WHAT?

18:10.755 --> 18:12.005
I WAS OUT WALKING,
AND IT JUST HIT ME.

18:12.073 --> 18:13.674
HE DID IT AGAIN.
HE SCREWED UP,

18:13.741 --> 18:15.276
AND NOW I'M THE ONE
FEELING GUILTY?

18:15.343 --> 18:16.377
WELL, ENOUGH.
I DON'T GIVE A CRAP

18:16.444 --> 18:18.212
IF HE COMES BACK
OR NOT.

18:20.215 --> 18:22.749
COULD YOU JUST HOLD ON
ONE MORE SECOND, PLEASE?

18:22.817 --> 18:24.634
WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

18:24.702 --> 18:26.069
Here's the deal, OK?

18:26.137 --> 18:28.371
He refuses to come home
here until he can undo

18:28.439 --> 18:29.907
all the bad stuff
he did to you.

18:29.975 --> 18:30.957
So what's he's doing,
he's calling

18:31.025 --> 18:32.626
all the people
he offended to apologize,

18:32.694 --> 18:33.427
or at least
he thinks he is.

18:33.494 --> 18:34.678
He's actually talking
to me and Holly

18:34.746 --> 18:36.880
pretending to be them.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.133
WHAT?

18:40.201 --> 18:42.570
Look, this is the last call,
and it's been working.

18:42.637 --> 18:44.271
Just pretend
to be Marilyn Syznick,

18:44.339 --> 18:46.423
accept his apology,
and this'll all be over.

18:46.491 --> 18:47.858
No, I don't want
to talk to him.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.292
ONE MORE SECOND.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.862
SHE'S JUST SLIPPING
INTO HER ROBE.

18:51.930 --> 18:52.996
Come on, do it.
Just do it.

18:53.064 --> 18:54.698
Just do it!

18:54.766 --> 18:57.701
Disguise your voice.

18:57.769 --> 19:01.071
HELLO?

19:01.139 --> 19:03.707
IS THIS
MARILYN SYZNICK?

19:03.774 --> 19:05.075
UH-HUH.

19:05.143 --> 19:07.177
IT'S ARTHUR SPOONER
CALLING.

19:07.244 --> 19:09.947
YEARS AGO, MY DAUGHTER
WAS IN YOUR BROWNIE TROOP.

19:10.014 --> 19:11.748
THAT IS, UNTIL
I ANGRILY ACCUSED YOU

19:11.816 --> 19:13.083
OF FAVORING
THE POLISH CHILDREN

19:13.151 --> 19:14.617
IN THE ASSIGNMENT
OF MERIT BADGES.

19:14.685 --> 19:15.618
DO YOU RECALL?

19:15.686 --> 19:17.087
MM-HMM.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.390
ANYWAY,
I'M CALLING TO APOLOGIZE

19:19.457 --> 19:20.924
AND ASK IF
YOU'D BE KIND ENOUGH

19:20.992 --> 19:22.893
TO SEND ALONG ANY PATCHES
OR CERTIFICATES

19:22.960 --> 19:24.828
SHE MAY HAVE LOST
ON MY ACCOUNT.

19:24.896 --> 19:28.699
OH, YES.
WELL, THAT'S FINE, YES.

19:28.766 --> 19:31.335
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.571
I KNOW THIS MUST
SEEM STRANGE TO YOU,

19:33.638 --> 19:35.272
GIVEN THAT CARRIE'S
A GROWN WOMAN NOW,

19:35.340 --> 19:39.243
BUT IN MY HEART SHE'LL
ALWAYS BE MY LITTLE BABY.

19:39.311 --> 19:40.477
WHY, I CAN
STILL REMEMBER

19:40.545 --> 19:41.978
WHEN SHE WAS
NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD

19:42.046 --> 19:45.015
AND CAME DOWN WITH A
TERRIBLE CASE OF THE CROUP.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.651
THE ONLY THINK THAT
EASED HER COUGHING FITS

19:47.719 --> 19:49.119
WAS WHEN I WALKED
WITH HER IN MY ARMS

19:49.187 --> 19:51.589
THROUGH
THE COLD NIGHT AIR.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.924
I MUST'VE WALKED
10 MILES WITH HER

19:53.991 --> 19:56.960
EVERY NIGHT FOR A WEEK.

19:57.028 --> 19:59.597
WOW.

19:59.664 --> 20:02.165
OH, I WOULD'VE WALKED
1,000 MILES IF I HAD TO.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.301
IT'S IRONIC.
I TRIED SO HARD

20:04.369 --> 20:05.669
TO PROTECT
THAT BEAUTIFUL CHILD,

20:05.737 --> 20:08.606
AND TODAY I FIND OUT
THAT IT WAS ME

20:08.673 --> 20:11.242
WHO HURT HER MOST OF ALL.

20:11.309 --> 20:14.445
IT RIPS MY HEART OUT.

20:14.512 --> 20:15.613
THE WORST PART IS

20:15.680 --> 20:17.814
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'LL EVER FORGIVE ME.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.056
SHE WILL.

20:26.124 --> 20:29.326
YOU'RE VERY KIND
TO SAY THAT, MARILYN.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.995
AND, IF I'M
REMEMBERING CORRECTLY,

20:32.063 --> 20:36.333
YOU'RE ALSO QUITE
WELL-ENDOWED UPSTAIRS.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.001
CAN I BUY YOU DINNER?

20:38.069 --> 20:39.236
EWW. NO!

20:39.304 --> 20:42.506
OH, COME ON,
DON'T BE COY.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.040
THE WAY
YOU'D UNDO A BUTTON

20:44.108 --> 20:45.842
ON YOUR TROOP LEADER'S VEST
WHEN I CAME IN,

20:45.910 --> 20:47.878
YOU DON'T THINK
I NOTICED THAT?

20:47.945 --> 20:50.947
WHAT?
GET OVER YOURSELF!

20:51.015 --> 20:52.132
TEASE.

21:03.378 --> 21:04.844
HEY.

21:04.912 --> 21:06.546
OH, HI.

21:06.614 --> 21:08.315
HOW YOU DOING?

21:10.284 --> 21:11.685
I GUESS
I'M STILL A LITTLE SAD.

21:11.752 --> 21:13.820
THIS WHOLE THING
WITH MY DAD, YOU KNOW?

21:13.888 --> 21:15.205
WHY? IT'S OVER.

21:15.273 --> 21:17.141
HE'S BACK.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.458
I KNOW.
IT'S JUST THAT,

21:18.526 --> 21:20.527
WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS

21:20.595 --> 21:21.729
AND YOU'RE FORCED
TO BRING UP

21:21.796 --> 21:24.664
ALL THOSE DARK
AND BURIED FEELINGS,

21:24.733 --> 21:28.602
IT JUST LEAVES YOU KIND
OF EMPTY INSIDE, YOU KNOW?

21:33.925 --> 21:36.777
<i>OOH! THE BACHELORETTE.</i>
