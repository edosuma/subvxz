00:07.171 --> 00:08.171
He's a whore.

00:09.171 --> 00:12.630
-Who are we talking about?
-Jules! The guy. He's a man-whore.

00:14.421 --> 00:15.463
I don't get it.

00:15.546 --> 00:16.880
And in the sack?

00:17.963 --> 00:19.588
-What?
-Tonight's chick.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.255
We didn't have sex.

00:25.171 --> 00:27.338
-Weren't you supposed to?
-Yes.

00:28.380 --> 00:32.255
Actually, her friend booked me
to help her get over a breakup.

00:32.338 --> 00:35.921
But I was given a full-on script,
I'm like the perfect guy...

00:36.505 --> 00:38.963
What's nice is
she's already payed for two dates.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.255
-Two paid up front with a script?
-Yep.

00:41.338 --> 00:43.380
Lucky you. Who are you supposed to be?

00:43.671 --> 00:48.963
-A schoolteacher. Cool, normal, romantic.
-Nice! I've never had a client like that.

00:51.713 --> 00:52.838
Hey, don't worry.

00:52.921 --> 00:54.838
-What could go wrong?
-Oh, I don't know.

00:55.255 --> 00:56.755
Gonorrhea? Herpes?

00:59.046 --> 01:01.213
Or worse! She could fall in love.

01:01.296 --> 01:04.255
This isn't <i>Pretty Woman.</i>
She won't fall in love with a hooker.

01:05.005 --> 01:08.005
Except she doesn't know he's a hooker!

01:09.046 --> 01:10.046
Are you thick?

01:10.796 --> 01:13.463
In <i>Pretty Woman,</i>
he knows, he's the one paying.

01:13.546 --> 01:16.463
In this case, you're paying...
Are you paying, by the way?

01:17.255 --> 01:18.255
Yeah.

01:18.838 --> 01:22.796
Honestly, it's super unlikely
she'll fall in love with him, Milou.

01:23.255 --> 01:26.671
He's the type of guy who says,
"Bon appÃ©tit!" Elsa hates--

01:26.755 --> 01:28.338
Shut up! Change of address.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.171
-What do you want--
-Shut up!

01:30.255 --> 01:32.713
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:32.796 --> 01:34.755
THE LAME PLAN

01:34.838 --> 01:36.505
THE CRAZY PLAN

01:36.588 --> 01:39.130
THE BOOTY PLAN

01:39.213 --> 01:41.088
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

01:43.171 --> 01:45.171
-It'll be quicker on foot.
-Yeah, yeah...

01:45.255 --> 01:48.088
Sorry about her.
Give her a good rating anyway.

01:48.171 --> 01:49.421
-Bye, Amine!
-Bye!

01:50.838 --> 01:54.046
-This is a big mistake.
-Shut it until we get to her place.

01:54.130 --> 01:57.630
-Then you can tell her everything.
-Just trust me!

01:58.046 --> 02:01.380
I briefed the guy really well.
I pimped him so she digged him.

02:02.671 --> 02:04.421
Because you met him in person?

02:15.713 --> 02:16.546
Jules?

02:16.630 --> 02:19.921
-It's ringing, it's ringing. It's her!
-What should I say?

02:20.463 --> 02:24.588
Dinner Friday night.

02:25.505 --> 02:28.296
<i>Yeah, right, you found it.</i>
<i>In Charlotte's bag.</i> No, on the bar at the party.

02:32.130 --> 02:33.505
ROGER LA GRENOUILLE, 8 P.M.?

02:33.588 --> 02:36.505
<i>-Where are you? Can I pick it up?</i>
-I could drop it off.

02:37.005 --> 02:39.880
-I'd like to see you again.
-You're wasting my time. Smile.

02:39.963 --> 02:41.505
-Like that?
-There we go.

02:41.588 --> 02:44.046
<i>-By the carousel?</i>
-Perfect. See you later.

02:44.463 --> 02:47.713
From now on, this is your new phone.

02:49.046 --> 02:51.046
<i>How could you do this to her?</i>

02:51.463 --> 02:54.088
Didn't she suffer enough with Max?
It's disgusting.

02:54.171 --> 02:57.546
It's not what you think.
It's a new app, like Deliveroo for dicks.

02:57.630 --> 03:00.380
There's something for everyone.
Look at these winkles!

03:00.713 --> 03:03.213
-No. No. No.
-These dongs, they're all guys.

03:04.421 --> 03:06.588
-What about saving Elsa?
-Can't hear you!

03:10.338 --> 03:11.755
It's illegal, too.

03:12.296 --> 03:13.296
Hey!

03:15.171 --> 03:20.130
-You're so old-school, I like to give.
-Oh, yeah? And how did you pay for this?

03:20.213 --> 03:23.630
Have you not lived rent-free
for two years because you're broke?

03:23.713 --> 03:26.421
-This is getting vulgar.
-Is your defense ready?

03:27.046 --> 03:28.963
Hey, Milou, chill out. Let it go. Think about Elsa.

03:34.713 --> 03:37.088
"It was really cool
to spend time with this guy."

03:37.171 --> 03:40.255
"OK, I panicked but it did me
a hell of a lot of good."

03:40.338 --> 03:42.171
"Sleep well, I love you, El."

03:46.838 --> 03:48.213
Stop sulking!

03:49.130 --> 03:52.463
I've only paid for two dates,
it will loosen her up.

03:53.088 --> 03:56.171
If I get the tiniest hint
of her getting attached...

03:56.255 --> 04:00.088
Then what? You'll stop talking to me?
You'll be pretty lonely, I'm your BFF.

04:01.588 --> 04:02.630
Order us an Uber?

04:03.588 --> 04:05.588
Come on, we're not walking home!

04:06.505 --> 04:07.505
Milou...

04:08.338 --> 04:09.755
Oh, you're such a pain!

04:13.130 --> 04:16.005
-Such a pain! Milou!
<i>-You're</i> a pain.

04:53.796 --> 04:56.588
NEW MESSAGE
TO: JULES DUPONT

04:56.671 --> 04:58.046
WHERE ARE YOU?

04:58.130 --> 05:00.796
I'M COMING!

05:04.380 --> 05:05.380
Lame.

05:17.005 --> 05:19.380
Come on, one spoon for Mommy...

05:19.463 --> 05:22.755
-Come on.
-Not sure about the sugar.

05:22.838 --> 05:27.046
It's not just sugar.
Sometimes, it's fries, pasta, kebab.

05:27.130 --> 05:28.296
Even some straw.

05:28.380 --> 05:29.213
Rubbish!

05:29.296 --> 05:30.588
Have they left yet?

05:41.046 --> 05:42.796
Can you hear that waterfall?

05:43.421 --> 05:45.630
-It's Milou's morning wee.
-Antoine!

05:45.713 --> 05:48.880
Now she's yelling at my brother
for something really serious

05:48.963 --> 05:50.838
like a teaspoon in the wrong place.

05:50.921 --> 05:51.921
Oh, shit!

05:59.130 --> 06:00.213
Shit out of luck!

06:00.296 --> 06:02.255
Do you want to go food-shopping later?

06:02.338 --> 06:04.796
Why not. How about an antique fair too?

06:04.880 --> 06:06.921
Brunch with your friends and their sprogs?

06:07.005 --> 06:08.546
Way to turn me on.

06:09.505 --> 06:11.713
You're such a potty mouth!

06:11.796 --> 06:14.463
You'll need to make an effort
for your interview today.

06:14.546 --> 06:17.296
I'm not sure it's really the job for me.

06:18.005 --> 06:19.755
Manager of a pastry store.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.171
-And the boss looks like the #MeToo kind.
-Sue him, then.

06:28.755 --> 06:29.880
-Hello?
-Who is it?

06:29.963 --> 06:31.421
Two seconds. It's your dad.

06:32.963 --> 06:35.380
Right, I'm off.
Catch you before your Eurostar?

06:35.463 --> 06:36.921
-OK, suits me.
-See you!

06:39.296 --> 06:40.296
<i>Yes, hello?</i>

06:40.380 --> 06:43.171
I can't talk right now but meet me at 11,
you know where.

06:44.005 --> 06:45.005
OK, perfect.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.213
-Was that him?
-Is my brother not here?

06:48.296 --> 06:49.838
Stop this!

06:49.921 --> 06:52.713
You haven't had
the happy trimester yet, have you?

06:52.796 --> 06:53.796
I have, actually.

06:56.588 --> 06:58.046
Antoine, she's doing it again.

06:58.130 --> 07:00.880
She's doing it again. That's enough.

07:00.963 --> 07:03.213
Stop putting your keys there,
we'll get robbed.

07:03.296 --> 07:05.421
Yes, they'll steal your non-stick pans.

07:05.505 --> 07:09.171
-OK, enjoy yoga! Have a good day!
-I will!

07:10.338 --> 07:12.171
-Antoine?
-In the bathroom.

07:14.213 --> 07:16.463
-Did you get my Weetabix?
-Morning.

07:16.546 --> 07:20.338
-Morning. Did you get my Weetabix?
-Yes, in the kitchen.

07:21.380 --> 07:23.505
Best bro del mundo!

07:27.713 --> 07:28.713
See you!

07:28.796 --> 07:30.463
-Flush?
-No time!

07:33.921 --> 07:35.463
NEW MESSAGE TO: JULES DUPONT

07:35.546 --> 07:38.046
FANCY A DRINK WITH MISS PIGGY ON FRIDAY?

07:38.921 --> 07:40.088
So lame...

07:41.921 --> 07:42.921
Hey. Hey.

07:46.338 --> 07:47.338
Hello.

07:48.005 --> 07:51.213
-You look like you're feeling better?
-Yep, absolutely.

07:51.630 --> 07:52.630
Yeah.

07:53.130 --> 07:56.463
-Did you hear about the sports hall?
-Vaguely.

07:58.213 --> 07:59.630
Talk about touchy...

08:00.630 --> 08:02.671
The news crews are already there.

08:03.505 --> 08:07.213
-I don't even know what to tell them.
-The truth? Oh, no, wait.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.713
Are you going to kick them out?

08:12.296 --> 08:15.171
I don't know. Wasn't that
your idea of a good solution?

08:16.380 --> 08:17.380
Bye. Yeah. Bye.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.005
Yes, they entered without permission,

08:30.088 --> 08:32.296
but the hall's been closed
for three months.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.838
It was freezing last night,
they had nowhere else to go.

08:38.130 --> 08:41.380
Sir, migrants are humans too, you know.

08:43.130 --> 08:47.130
OK. Tell me, apart from you,
who has a problem with them being there?

08:48.380 --> 08:52.505
So, you can take your complaint
and shove it right up your ass.

08:52.588 --> 08:53.630
Thanks for your call.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.088
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:08.838 --> 09:10.046
What's going on?

09:10.130 --> 09:12.546
I paid you for sex,
not for snacks and then bed.

09:12.630 --> 09:15.755
-I'm sorry but she's like Fort Knox.
-She's scared, man.

09:15.838 --> 09:18.088
That's why I'm paying you,
to unlock the fort.

09:18.171 --> 09:21.505
Usually, when I enter the stage,
the door is wide open...

09:22.296 --> 09:24.005
No means no, golden rule.

09:25.088 --> 09:26.755
Don't you need milk with that?

09:26.838 --> 09:29.130
Can you focus for a second, please?

09:29.546 --> 09:32.130
Right. Phase two. Here's the program.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.671
OK, you do exactly
what's written there. Then...

09:37.713 --> 09:38.838
give her this to eat.

09:39.838 --> 09:41.505
She'll spill it, for sure.

09:41.588 --> 09:44.963
Take her top off... You know how it goes.

09:46.963 --> 09:49.588
-OK, I'll try.
-No, you'll give it your all.

09:49.671 --> 09:50.838
Give it your all, man!

09:52.338 --> 09:55.130
Did you learn your lines
about your dad and the watchman?

09:55.213 --> 09:56.296
Yeah...

09:56.380 --> 09:59.338
-You don't sound convinced. Did you?
-Yes. Don't you trust me?

09:59.421 --> 10:01.796
Yeah... Let's say I do.

10:02.963 --> 10:04.880
Right. Oh, slightly awkward detail.

10:05.380 --> 10:06.921
Your card was declined.

10:08.213 --> 10:09.130
Really?

10:09.213 --> 10:11.796
Take care of it before tonight
or this is for me.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.921
Yeah, all right.

10:13.005 --> 10:16.088
I have, like, 2,000 credit cards,
who do you think I am?

10:19.963 --> 10:20.963
Jules! Jules!

10:21.338 --> 10:23.755
What did you think of her? Cute, right?

10:24.546 --> 10:27.046
-Is she cute or not?
-What difference does it make?

10:27.130 --> 10:29.046
You like her...

10:29.755 --> 10:33.005
I knew it. Give it your all!
I'm with you all the way.

10:37.171 --> 10:38.171
I'm a genius!

10:45.755 --> 10:47.421
Benjy, my buddy!

10:48.630 --> 10:49.630
How's it going?

10:50.338 --> 10:53.380
-Did you like it?
-He's made a lot of progress.

10:53.755 --> 10:55.713
-Hi, Manon.
-How's it going?

10:57.463 --> 10:59.755
-You coming to Karine's drinks?
-I don't know.

10:59.838 --> 11:03.630
-I don't know, maybe.
-You're in demand...

11:04.296 --> 11:06.255
It's my girlfriend's shopping list.

11:06.338 --> 11:07.463
And this. Right...

11:10.880 --> 11:11.880
Yeah...

11:12.546 --> 11:15.171
-Right. See you later.
-See you later.

11:17.546 --> 11:20.255
Now, in Weetabix boxes,
there's, like, 16 biscuits.

11:20.338 --> 11:24.171
There used to be 32,
34 if you were lucky. Crazy, right?

11:24.255 --> 11:26.421
-That's marketing for you.
-Marketing?

11:26.505 --> 11:30.130
Half the number of biscuits
so that you buy twice as many boxes.

11:30.213 --> 11:31.463
-It makes sense.
-Yeah.

11:31.796 --> 11:34.546
By the way, darling,
could you lend me 200 euros?

11:34.630 --> 11:37.046
Like today, right now, before 6:30 p.m.?

11:38.380 --> 11:42.255
-It's for Elsa's birthday.
-I've already chipped in online.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.421
-Oh, yeah, the online kitty...
-I don't know.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.296
-I'll see what I have.
-Don't worry about it.

11:51.921 --> 11:55.171
I won't walk you to the train,
this isn't <i>Titanic.</i>

11:55.255 --> 11:57.838
PROBLEM WITH YOUR CONTRACT.
STAY IN PARIS. CALL ME.

11:58.296 --> 12:00.505
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

12:00.588 --> 12:01.963
Right, I'm off.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.046
-See you! Bye, buddy!
-See you next time!

12:23.921 --> 12:24.921
Hello.

12:32.671 --> 12:33.963
<i>Cut the snow, please.</i>

12:35.421 --> 12:36.755
Fancy lunch with me?

12:38.046 --> 12:40.713
I might look unattainable but I'm cool.

12:41.421 --> 12:42.421
So they say.

12:44.255 --> 12:46.713
And my roommate is late so I have time.

12:48.421 --> 12:50.796
-Do I know you?
-You might.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.213
Oops.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
The ad.

12:56.463 --> 12:58.421
The thing for... Carole!

12:58.838 --> 13:02.005
-Yeah?
-The extra. He's from that ad.

13:02.505 --> 13:04.338
-The one who farts in the lift.
-No!

13:04.421 --> 13:06.380
-You know, Flatuline!
-Flatuline?

13:07.171 --> 13:08.630
The price of success, man.

13:08.713 --> 13:11.213
-How did it go?
-Two secs, I'm still in character.

13:11.755 --> 13:12.755
It's not easy.

13:14.588 --> 13:16.880
It will never be finished
before Baby arrives.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.505
Are you an architect now?

13:19.421 --> 13:21.296
Hey, tea break is over, guys.

13:22.755 --> 13:25.880
How long do I have to lie
to my brother about your mat leave?

13:25.963 --> 13:28.088
Antoine still thinks you're going to yoga?

13:28.171 --> 13:30.838
If I went as much as I say I do,
I'd be the Dalai Lama.

13:32.963 --> 13:34.463
What about the hottie, Jules?

13:34.546 --> 13:35.755
What are you waiting for?

13:36.380 --> 13:39.755
-I don't know, I have a mental block.
-Don't force yourself.

13:39.838 --> 13:41.380
-You're not feeling it.
-Really?

13:41.463 --> 13:42.630
-Yes.
-No.

13:42.713 --> 13:43.838
Just send him a text.

13:43.921 --> 13:44.921
-No.
-Yes.

13:45.005 --> 13:46.338
-No.
-Yes.

13:46.421 --> 13:47.796
-Yes!
-No!

13:47.880 --> 13:49.213
She has a mental block.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.130
Yes. But what do I say?

13:51.838 --> 13:54.463
If it's to end up in little pieces
and fed to pigs...

13:54.880 --> 13:57.921
-A guy killed a girl he met on Tinder.
-Yeah?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.505
That's <i>Black Mirror.</i>

13:59.588 --> 14:00.838
You're just rusty, honey.

14:00.921 --> 14:01.963
Trust me!

14:02.046 --> 14:04.713
Hang on. Let me do this. Hang on!

14:04.796 --> 14:06.838
Just a sec. Right.

14:08.255 --> 14:10.005
Simple, direct...

14:10.713 --> 14:12.171
cute and sent.

14:12.255 --> 14:14.588
-Oh, no!
-You didn't send that?

14:14.963 --> 14:16.296
Oh, no, no, no!

14:17.755 --> 14:19.796
Shit, all this is potato starch?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.463
That's the magic of cinema.

14:21.963 --> 14:25.338
-They're not going to wait for it to snow.
-Absolutely.

14:30.046 --> 14:32.296
What's that thing? A walkie-talkie?

14:32.380 --> 14:35.005
Elsa's mate gave it to me,
all part of the act.

14:35.588 --> 14:38.255
-So, it's Elsa now?
-I don't get the text. Here.

14:39.463 --> 14:42.255
-Don't send any BS.
-Your thing can't read emojis.

14:43.130 --> 14:45.880
I'll forward it to my phone
so we can decode it.

14:47.338 --> 14:48.171
So?

14:49.130 --> 14:50.296
Peach, corn, heart.

14:51.213 --> 14:53.463
-She's up for it.
-And yet...

14:53.546 --> 14:54.796
What shall we reply?

14:55.796 --> 14:56.630
Here.

15:00.171 --> 15:03.296
A theater? I'm supposed
to spike her interest with a theater?

15:03.380 --> 15:06.713
No need, she's a client.
Just write what's on the paper.

15:08.505 --> 15:10.546
I'll just add a couple of eggplants...

15:11.213 --> 15:12.588
a peach and a tongue.

15:13.171 --> 15:14.380
-Classy.
-Shit...

15:15.421 --> 15:17.338
Meet at the stage door.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.713
DÃ©jazet Theater. 6:30 p.m.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.171
And the final touch:
corn, donut, wet, wet.

15:26.255 --> 15:27.255
Done.

15:31.380 --> 15:34.880
-This will translate to a normal text?
-Dude. Am I a geek or what?

15:36.213 --> 15:37.213
Forward it. He's replied!

15:40.046 --> 15:42.546
-What did he say?
-Alien, alien, poop, baby.

15:43.005 --> 15:45.630
Stage door. DÃ©jazet Theater. 6:30 p.m.

15:46.338 --> 15:48.755
Santa, hospital, hospital.

15:49.671 --> 15:50.713
Typical psychopath.

15:50.796 --> 15:51.880
It's positive, right?

15:51.963 --> 15:54.755
Well, it's not negative,
and you have a date, girl!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.171
The aliens must be a metaphor for us.

15:58.421 --> 16:00.963
And the Santa means
you're a gift from Heaven.

16:01.296 --> 16:02.838
-You think so?
-No.

16:06.005 --> 16:08.713
-DÃ©jazet Theater. Intriguing, right?
-Yeah!

16:08.796 --> 16:11.713
-He's original, I love it.
-It's just a theater!

16:12.505 --> 16:14.421
What I don't get is the poop emoji.

16:14.838 --> 16:19.255
Ah, yeah! Maybe it's to say
we're like two aliens...

16:19.796 --> 16:20.838
in this shitty world.

16:24.338 --> 16:27.671
Who cares! Just reply.
Otherwise, it's like you're playing games.

16:27.755 --> 16:29.171
-And that's whorish.
-Is it?

16:29.255 --> 16:30.546
-Yes.
-Nonsense.

16:30.630 --> 16:32.296
-You're right, it's whorish.
-Yep.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.255
-No!
-You found a man in the fax-machine era.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.296
-Well, yeah.
-OK.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.713
-You don't know anything.
-Yes, I do.

16:49.463 --> 16:51.546
DEJAZET THEATER

17:05.130 --> 17:06.546
Sorry, I'm always late.

17:07.588 --> 17:10.005
Three minutes, I can forgive you.
How are you?

17:10.921 --> 17:12.171
-Shall we?
-Yes.

17:14.171 --> 17:15.296
Is it a surprise?

17:17.005 --> 17:18.005
Do you trust me? Yes.

17:24.588 --> 17:25.588
It's Jules.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.671
Evening, sir.

17:29.755 --> 17:30.755
EMERGENCY EXIT

17:30.838 --> 17:32.630
Where are we going? What is this?

17:33.671 --> 17:36.463
-Sweet, you even planned a picnic.
-Yeah.

17:36.546 --> 17:38.296
-What's in the boxes?
-Meatballs. -Meatballs?
-Don't you like them?

17:40.213 --> 17:41.630
-Meatball sandwiches?
-Yes.

17:41.713 --> 17:43.338
I live for meatballs!

17:45.921 --> 17:48.005
What's going on? This is so cool.

17:48.088 --> 17:49.921
-How do you know this place?
-Come.

17:50.005 --> 17:51.755
Have you always lived in Paris?

17:51.838 --> 17:55.338
I have but, actually,
I don't look at the city anymore.

17:55.421 --> 17:58.421
I don't. We always go
to the same places, it's boring.

17:58.505 --> 17:59.796
We're... Whoa!

18:00.630 --> 18:02.921
-This is incredible. So beautiful.
-Come.

18:03.005 --> 18:07.088
So, you see, it's a shame,
we should take time to enjoy it.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.046
-Whoa!
-Shush!

18:15.880 --> 18:17.588
Come on! Come!

18:27.880 --> 18:29.630
MANON: LUNCH TOMORROW?

18:29.713 --> 18:31.338
<i>With pleasure.</i>

18:35.921 --> 18:38.338
-Is that you?
-No, it's Catherine Deneuve.

18:39.588 --> 18:43.005
-Did you stay till close?
-No, we just chatted for a while.

18:43.088 --> 18:44.505
You know, pregnancy chat.

18:46.421 --> 18:49.130
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to shower.

18:49.213 --> 18:50.213
Can I come with you?

18:51.046 --> 18:54.838
No, I don't feel like it. I'm fat
and I don't want you to see me naked.

18:55.671 --> 18:57.713
I need some me time, I'm about to pop.

18:58.005 --> 18:59.921
-My little popcorn!
-No.

19:00.630 --> 19:02.296
And set your phone to silent.

19:02.755 --> 19:04.505
You know I hate those beeps.

19:04.588 --> 19:09.463
We live in a world of stupid little beeps:
dishwasher, TV, washing-machine, phone.

19:09.546 --> 19:11.005
I'm sick of it!

19:14.130 --> 19:15.130
Are you mad at me? No, don't worry.

19:17.171 --> 19:19.213
-OK, I love you.
-Me too.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.255
It's really good.

19:50.546 --> 19:53.588
-This can't be the first time you do this.
-I'm sorry?

19:53.671 --> 19:57.338
You know, the secret theater,
the concert, the picnic.

20:00.088 --> 20:01.546
Fancy a sandwich?

20:02.463 --> 20:04.088
Nice swerve.

20:08.546 --> 20:09.671
OK, I'll confess.

20:10.505 --> 20:11.755
I came here as a kid.

20:13.088 --> 20:16.380
My father was a fan
of music and theater and...

20:16.755 --> 20:19.671
he couldn't afford it
but had a deal with the night watchman.

20:19.963 --> 20:20.963
Yeah?

20:21.838 --> 20:26.255
It's not the first time I come here but...
you <i>are</i> the first girl I've come with.

20:34.963 --> 20:37.088
In my family, music is a religion.

20:43.255 --> 20:44.088
Shit!

20:44.546 --> 20:45.380
Shit.

20:45.463 --> 20:47.755
-Don't worry about it.
-What an idiot!

20:48.130 --> 20:51.130
Why can't I stay clean
like all those girls

20:51.213 --> 20:55.255
with their perfect messy bobs,
their slim black jeans...

20:55.338 --> 20:58.171
I'm a mess, I'm disgusting.
Even when I'm clean, I'm not.

20:58.255 --> 20:59.963
What are you on about? Who cares?

21:06.213 --> 21:07.755
-Let's take it off.
-Yeah?

21:08.463 --> 21:10.546
Hang on, just a sec, sorry, I...

21:10.630 --> 21:12.505
-What's up?
-I...

21:13.213 --> 21:15.755
-I can't.
-What do you mean?

21:16.630 --> 21:17.921
I need to leave, sorry.

21:18.005 --> 21:19.546
-You're leaving?
-Yes.

21:19.630 --> 21:21.088
There's an hour left.

21:31.255 --> 21:32.088
Elsa!

21:34.046 --> 21:35.046
Elsa! Elsa, wait.

21:39.880 --> 21:40.880
Elsa. Wait up!

21:43.296 --> 21:44.838
Shit, I'm sorry.

21:46.255 --> 21:49.005
-I'm sorry, what's wrong?
-Everything.

21:49.505 --> 21:50.505
I'm rubbish.

21:50.838 --> 21:53.380
You're anything but rubbish.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.421
You're beautiful.

21:57.421 --> 21:59.630
You're so pretty
I forgot about your jumper.

22:02.005 --> 22:03.380
Don't leave like this.

22:21.713 --> 22:23.213
That's all well and good but...

22:23.296 --> 22:24.838
next time, you're fucking him.

22:24.921 --> 22:26.380
There won't be a next time.

22:34.130 --> 22:35.588
What's going on?

22:37.171 --> 22:39.046
You're acting so weird tonight.

22:40.171 --> 22:41.921
Are you hiding something from me?

22:48.213 --> 22:49.213
Huh?

22:51.588 --> 22:53.213
OK, we have to confess.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.421
Charlotte has to confess.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.588
Are you coming?

23:07.505 --> 23:09.796
We didn't find anywhere
for your birthday party.

23:11.130 --> 23:12.130
Phew... I was so worried.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.463
And...

23:22.588 --> 23:24.755
And... And...

23:25.296 --> 23:26.296
And... And... And...

23:27.796 --> 23:30.630
don't expect a group gift
because no one chipped in.

23:35.088 --> 23:36.088
For now.

23:37.005 --> 23:38.130
Yes, for now.
