YOU WERE HAVING SOME TROUBLE

OF YOUR HAND.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.254
- [laughs]
JUST FOR A SECOND.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.455
IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.824
- MR. TAYLOR,
IF YOU'RE HAVING A PROBLEM--

13:10.858 --> 13:13.126

YOUNG MAN, JUSTIN.

YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ADMITTED
TO I.F.A. IF YOU WEREN'T.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.591
BUT, AS YOU KNOW,

13:44.624 --> 13:49.096
THIS IS
A VERY STRENUOUS PROGRAM.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.868
I THINK YOU NEED
TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER

13:54.902 --> 13:57.304
WHETHER YOU'RE ABLE
TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.

I GOT SOME FRIENDS DOWN IN
ST. PETE, TELLING ME FOR YEARS

15:06.673 --> 15:09.076

15:22.655 --> 15:24.591
MAYBE I'LL START UP A BAND.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.493
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
A DREAM OF MINE.

FOR GETTING OUT OF BED.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.105
FOR DOING SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE.

WHICH, APPARENTLY,
IS QUITE A BIG COMPLIMENT

IN FACT,
OUT OF THE 6 BILLION PEOPLE

IN THE WORLD,
I'M SURE I RANK SOMEWHERE

I CAN RETURN THE FAVOR...

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:29.809 --> 23:31.678
- GAY PRIDE.
HOW DID THEY TURN OUT?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.646
- YOU'RE GOING TO HATE ME
FOR SAYING THIS,

23:33.680 --> 23:36.082
BUT YOU MAKE
ONE BITCHIN' BROAD.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.651
- I CAN'T BELIEVE I LET YOU
TALK ME INTO WEARING A DRESS.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.720
- [chuckles]

23:40.753 --> 23:43.623
- HERE I AM, KISSING MY BOSS,

23:43.656 --> 23:44.824
THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE
IN THE WORLD.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.727
- HONEY, THAT'S WHAT PRIDE
IS ALL ABOUT.

23:47.760 --> 23:51.564
LOVE AND FORGIVENESS, I MEAN.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.900
ARE YOU WEARING BLUSH?

24:06.679 --> 24:08.615
- [sighs]

25:14.180 --> 25:16.783
- THE LOST BOY RETURNS.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.791
[refrigerator door shuts]

25:24.824 --> 25:26.092
[bottle cap clicks off]

25:32.298 --> 25:34.967
- [chuckling]

25:36.168 --> 25:38.705
[bottle clatters]

25:40.740 --> 25:41.974
- FEELING BETTER?

25:42.008 --> 25:44.911
- LOTS.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.779
- HOW'S DAPHNE?

25:46.813 --> 25:49.315
- SHE AND HER ROOMMATES
HAD TO STUDY.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.918
FORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.721
I WENT TO WOODY'S.
I LET GUYS BUY ME DRINKS.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.589
THEY ALL WANTED TO FUCK ME.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.659
AT LEAST I STILL HAVE MY LOOKS.

25:59.692 --> 26:00.693
I TOLD THEM NO.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.562
I'M SAVING THAT FOR YOU.

26:06.699 --> 26:08.801
- AREN'T YOU A SWEETHEART?

26:08.835 --> 26:11.671
- LET'S GO.
COME ON.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.172
- LATER.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.708
COME AND SEE WHAT I GOT YOU.
- WHAT?

26:15.742 --> 26:17.209
A NEW BUTT PLUG?
MANACLES?

26:17.243 --> 26:19.211
I KNOW, A VACU-PUMP?
- BETTER.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.614
I SAW IT TODAY AT WORK. IT'S--
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.

26:21.648 --> 26:22.815
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

26:22.849 --> 26:24.617
- SURE I DO.
IT'S FALSE HOPE.

26:24.651 --> 26:26.686
- BUT YOU CAN DRAW WITH IT, SEE?

26:26.719 --> 26:27.920
SAME AS A PEN

26:27.954 --> 26:29.288
OR A PENCIL
OR A PAINTBRUSH.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.090
JUST MUCH EASIER TO CONTROL.

26:31.123 --> 26:35.628
- OH, LIKE WITH MY GIMP HAND?

26:35.662 --> 26:38.097
- AND THERE'S A MILLION SPECIAL
EFFECTS YOU CAN CREATE WITH IT.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.967
STOP BEING A FUCKING PRINCESS
AND COME GIVE IT A TRY.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.369
- WHAT FOR?
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY?

26:43.402 --> 26:45.104
SO THAT YOU CAN TELL YOURSELF

26:45.137 --> 26:46.706
YOU FIXED
LITTLE JUSTIN'S PROBLEMS

26:46.739 --> 26:49.842
AND MADE EVERYTHING ALL BETTER?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.644
WELL, YOU CAN'T FIX THIS,
ALL RIGHT?

26:51.678 --> 26:53.612
NO ONE CAN.

26:57.750 --> 26:58.885
- SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO QUIT.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.821
- IT'S OVER, ALL RIGHT?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.890
ACCEPT IT.
I'M NOT GOING TO DRAW AGAIN.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.659
AND NO FUCKING
ELECTRONIC CRAYOLA BOX

27:06.693 --> 27:08.895
IS GOING TO FIX THAT.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.301
SO WHY DON'T YOU COME FUCK ME
BEFORE I PASS OUT?

27:22.909 --> 27:24.210
- EXCUSE ME, SIR,
CAN YOU TELL ME

27:24.243 --> 27:25.712
WHERE I CAN FIND
THE RUBBER NOSES?

27:25.745 --> 27:27.780
I HEAR THEY'RE GETTING YOU
A BUNNY SUIT

27:27.814 --> 27:29.315
FOR THE EASTER SALE.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.050
- DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE
ANYTHING BETTER TO DO,

27:31.083 --> 27:33.753
LIKE YOUR JOBS?
- WE'RE JUST KIDDING AROUND.

27:33.786 --> 27:35.988
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU KID AROUND
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

27:36.022 --> 27:38.190
[laughter]

27:38.224 --> 27:41.327
THEY'RE THE CLOWNS.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.697
- THEY WERE RIGHT.
I WAS RIDICULOUS.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.834
- OKAY, NOVOTNY,
BETTER GET INTO THIS.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.368
- WHAT?

27:49.401 --> 27:51.070
- YOU DID SUCH A GREAT JOB
YESTERDAY,

27:51.103 --> 27:52.138
I FIGURED
YOU SHOULD DO IT AGAIN TODAY.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.907
- NO FUCKING WAY!
- HEY, WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE, PAL.

27:54.941 --> 27:57.409
THIS IS A FAMILY STORE.
NOW GET DRESSED.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.178
- SORRY, ANDREW,
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE

27:59.211 --> 28:00.179
TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

28:00.212 --> 28:03.182
- EXCUSE ME?
- I SAID NO!

28:03.215 --> 28:05.084
- IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,
I'M THE MANAGER NOW.

28:05.117 --> 28:06.986
- I'M WELL AWARE OF THAT,

28:07.019 --> 28:09.121
SINCE YOU'VE MANAGED
TO NEVER LET ME FORGET IT.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.190
BUT THE THING YOU CAN'T FORGET

28:11.223 --> 28:13.025
IS THAT THE ONLY REASON
YOU HAVE THIS JOB

28:13.059 --> 28:14.360
IS BECAUSE I LEFT.

28:14.393 --> 28:17.196
MY ONLY MISTAKE IS
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME BACK.

28:17.229 --> 28:21.200
- I SAID PUT IT ON.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.702
- AND I SAID NO.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.475
- PUT IT ON...

28:29.508 --> 28:31.978
OR YOU'RE FIRED.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.255
- FUCK YOU.

28:46.192 --> 28:49.996
BYE, TRACE.
- BYE.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.834
- SO LONG, LOVER-BOY.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.471
- ATTENTION, BIG Q SHOPPERS,

28:59.505 --> 29:02.875
ANOTHER DAY,
ANOTHER DOLLAR SALE.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.977
FOR ALL YOUR COSMETIC NEEDS,

29:05.011 --> 29:06.913
FROM LIPSTICK TO EYELINER...

29:06.946 --> 29:10.082
- YEAH!

29:10.116 --> 29:12.318
- WATCH YOUR BACKS,
HOT STUFF COMING THROUGH.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.854
- NO KIDDIN'.
WHOO!

29:14.887 --> 29:17.256
- I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE EAT
A DOUGHNUT LIKE THAT BEFORE.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.091
IS IT A SOUTHERN SORT OF THING?

29:19.125 --> 29:22.328
- MM, MORE OF A SURVIVAL SORT
OF THING.

29:22.361 --> 29:26.132
TRY AND GRAB IT.

29:26.165 --> 29:30.236
- OH, GOD!
[chuckles]

29:30.269 --> 29:31.437
- MISS MANNERS
MAY NOT HAVE APPROVED,

29:31.470 --> 29:33.372
BUT, WITH SIX HUNGRY BROTHERS
AND SISTERS,

29:33.405 --> 29:35.141
IT'S HOW I KEPT MY BELLY FULL.

29:35.174 --> 29:39.511
[tapping cup]
MM, HEY! MORE COFFEE, JAVA BOY.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.457
- OH!
- CAREFUL. CAREFUL.

29:53.325 --> 29:55.494
- MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO GIVE
YOUR HAND A REST, HUH, SUNSHINE?

29:55.527 --> 29:57.964
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD MIND
YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.202
- WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY TO ME?

30:03.235 --> 30:04.904
- I SAID MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.438
- YEAH, I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.107
- THEN WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO REPEAT IT?

30:08.140 --> 30:09.575
- I WANTED TO BE SURE
I HEARD IT CORRECTLY.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.344
- [sighs]
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.183
- JUSTIN!

30:20.552 --> 30:23.089
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU SUCKS,

30:23.122 --> 30:26.158
AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME POLLYANNA SHIT

30:26.192 --> 30:28.060
ABOUT EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON

30:28.094 --> 30:31.463
OR THIS WAS GOD'S GIFT
TO MAKE YOU STRONG.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.066
'CAUSE, IF ANYBODY HAD SAID THAT
TO ME, HONEY,

30:34.100 --> 30:35.601
WHEN VIC WAS DYING,
I WOULDA PUNCHED 'EM

30:35.634 --> 30:40.539
RIGHT IN THE FUCKING MOUTH.

30:40.572 --> 30:43.509
ALL YOU CAN DO AT A TIME
LIKE THIS

30:43.542 --> 30:47.880
IS JUST HANG ON
UNTIL THE SCENERY CHANGES.

30:50.516 --> 30:54.620
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME
LEND A HAND

30:54.653 --> 30:56.588
IN POURING THE HOT STUFF, OKAY?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.929
- MM-HMM.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.499
- AND ONE MORE THING.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.436
THE NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT,

31:10.469 --> 31:12.304
I'M GONNA RIP YOU
A NEW BUTTHOLE SO BIG,

31:12.338 --> 31:16.608
YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE
TO TAKE A CANNON UP YOUR ASS.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.510
[knocking on counter]

31:18.544 --> 31:20.646
- BYE.
- BYE.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.348
- CAN I GET SOME EGGS EASY OVER
WITH BROWN TOAST?

31:22.381 --> 31:27.586
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU NEED A BREAK.

31:27.619 --> 31:30.556
[indistinct chatter]

31:35.561 --> 31:37.463
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:37.496 --> 31:41.033
- WHO GIVES A SHIT WHAT I THINK?

31:41.067 --> 31:44.336
[clears throat]
THE COMPOSITION'S GOOD.

31:44.370 --> 31:49.008
THE TECHNIQUE, USE OF COLOR,
IT'S INTERESTING.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.077
I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE
FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.112
- A SAD YOUNG MAN.

31:53.145 --> 31:54.413
- YEAH, WHO NEEDS
TO LOOK AT THAT?

31:54.446 --> 31:59.618
- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE GOT
A MIRROR.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.153
- I LIKE THAT ONE.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.089
IT'S, UM...

32:03.122 --> 32:05.357
IT'S LESS REPRESENTATIONAL.
IT'S MORE SPONTANEOUS.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.526
IT'S MORE ANGRY.

32:07.559 --> 32:10.462
- LIKE WHAT YOU'RE FEELING?

32:13.232 --> 32:15.067
- THE ARTIST
HAS OBVIOUSLY BEEN INFLUENCED

32:15.101 --> 32:17.603
BY THE WORK
OF THE ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISTS--

32:17.636 --> 32:20.639
DE KOONING.
GOTTLIEB.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.274
KLEIN.
- LINDSAY!

32:22.308 --> 32:24.977
LONG TIME, BABE.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.513
- TOO LONG.
MWAH.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.181
MWAH.

32:29.215 --> 32:30.482
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SHOW.
- THANKS.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.451
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- SOLD THREE ALREADY.

32:32.484 --> 32:33.585
- NOT BAD.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.587
- A COUPLE MORE,
I'M ON MY WAY TO RIO.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.189
- [chuckling]

32:37.223 --> 32:38.590
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET A FRIEND.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.292
THIS IS JUSTIN TAYLOR.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.427
THIS IS ADRIENNE BENNETT.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.628
SHE'S THE ARTIST.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.730
JUSTIN'S AN ARTIST TOO.

32:44.763 --> 32:46.465
HE WAS JUST COMMENTING
ON THIS PIECE,

32:46.498 --> 32:49.268
HOW MUCH HE LIKED
THE SPONTANEITY, THE ANGER.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.438
- I WAS IN A MOOD THAT DAY.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.207
SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF YOU DO?

32:55.241 --> 32:58.044
- I DON'T ANYMORE.
I GAVE IT UP.

32:58.077 --> 32:59.378
- HMM.

32:59.411 --> 33:00.779
CHRIST,
IF I COULDN'T WORK,

33:00.812 --> 33:02.348
I'D WHEEL MYSELF OFF A CLIFF.

33:02.381 --> 33:06.385
- HOW DO YOU? I MEAN--
- WORK?

33:06.418 --> 33:08.387
UH, THE WAY TWO SNAILS FUCK:

33:08.420 --> 33:11.457
VERY SLOWLY.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.425
[laughter]

33:13.459 --> 33:15.227
I GOT THIS CONTRAPTION I CALL
THE ONE-ARM BANDIT

33:15.261 --> 33:16.728
THEY STRAPPED TO MY GOOD ARM.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.564
THAT'S THE WAY
I DIRECT THE BRUSH.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.299
- SOUNDS HARD.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.101
- SO WHAT'S EASY
BESIDES COMPLAINING?

33:22.134 --> 33:23.535
- AS IF YOU NEVER DID THAT.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.339
- OH, BACK OFF, BITCH.
I'LL ROLL OVER YOUR FOOT.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.741
NOW I'LL ADMIT
I WASN'T TOO PLEASED

33:29.775 --> 33:32.544
AFTER DOING A SPIN-OUT
ON THE PENN-LINCOLN PARKWAY

33:32.578 --> 33:35.081
TO WAKE UP AND DISCOVER
MY TAP-DANCING DAYS WERE OVER.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.049
LET ALONE PAINTING.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.750
IN FACT,
I WAS OFFERING BIG BUCKS

33:38.784 --> 33:42.054
TO ANYONE WHO'D SHOOT ME.

33:42.088 --> 33:45.057
YOU MUST BE FEELING
THE SAME WAY.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.198
IT AIN'T THE END
OF THE WORLD, KID.

33:52.231 --> 33:56.102
UNLESS YOU WANT IT TO BE.

33:56.135 --> 33:59.205
NOW PICK A PAINTING.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.273
- HMM?
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.709
- ADRIENNE.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

34:03.742 --> 34:05.711
THERE'S PLENTY MORE
WHERE THESE CAME FROM.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.152
- I JUST CALLED THE BIG Q.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.387
THEY SAID THAT YOU
NO LONGER WORK THERE,

34:15.421 --> 34:16.555
THAT YOU QUIT?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.324
- THAT'S RIGHT, MA.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.626
- WHY WOULD YOU DO
A STUPID THING LIKE THAT?

34:20.659 --> 34:23.329
- WELL,
I'M FOLLOWING MY DREAM.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.464
- TO BE UNEMPLOYED?
[door opens]

34:25.497 --> 34:27.133
- LEAVE HIM ALONE, DEB.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.135
- I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
THAT YOU'D BE INVOLVED.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.502
- I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.471
- YEAH, I'VE BEEN HEARING THAT
SINCE YOU WERE 14.

34:32.504 --> 34:33.839
- IT'S HIS LIFE.
- YEAH, THAT'S EASY

34:33.872 --> 34:35.607
FOR YOU TO SAY.
YOU CAN PAY YOUR BILLS.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.476
- WOULD YOU TWO KNOCK IT OFF?

34:37.509 --> 34:39.245
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.279
- ON WHAT?

34:40.312 --> 34:42.281
I'M AUCTIONING SOMETHING
ON EBAY.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.116
- YOUR MOTHER?

34:44.150 --> 34:46.318
DON'T START THE BIDDING
TOO HIGH.

34:46.352 --> 34:48.354
- MY CAPTAIN ASTRO.
VOLUME ONE. ISSUE ONE.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.256
- THE ONE I BOUGHT YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

34:50.289 --> 34:52.891
THAT COST A FUCKING MINT.
- I KNOW.

34:52.924 --> 34:58.197
IF I GET ENOUGH FOR IT,
I'M GOING TO BUY BUZZY'S STORE.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.598
- YOU'RE BUYING
A COMIC BOOK STORE?

34:59.631 --> 35:00.732
THAT'S CRAZY.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.868
- SO IS STAYING IN A JOB
WHERE I'M GOING TO BE MISERABLE

35:02.901 --> 35:05.671
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.476
[thud]
- WHAT'S THE BID AT?

35:10.509 --> 35:13.379
- IT'S STUCK AT $1,000.
- $1,000?

35:13.412 --> 35:15.514
FUCK, IT'S WORTH MORE THAN THAT.
SCOOT OVER.

35:15.547 --> 35:17.183
- IF YOU SAID
YOU WERE REALLY SORRY,

35:17.216 --> 35:18.884
MAYBE THEY'D GIVE YOU
YOUR JOB BACK.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.219
- THERE'S
ONLY A FEW MINUTES LEFT.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.920
- HOW DOES $5,000 SOUND?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.489
- YOU'RE BIDDING ON IT YOURSELF?

35:23.522 --> 35:25.491
- WHY IN THE FUCK
WOULD YOU DO THAT?

35:25.524 --> 35:26.892
YOU ALREADY BOUGHT IT ONCE.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.860
- THE SECRET TO GETTING SOMEONE
TO WANT SOMETHING

35:28.894 --> 35:31.563
IS CONVINCING THEM SOMEONE ELSE
WANTS IT MORE.

35:31.597 --> 35:36.302
- THAT'LL NEVER WORK.
PEOPLE AREN'T THAT STUPID.

35:36.335 --> 35:39.605
- $6,000.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.174
- THEN AGAIN...

35:42.208 --> 35:43.475
[objects rustling]

35:43.509 --> 35:46.412
- HANDY.

35:46.445 --> 35:51.483
SEX MEN.

35:51.517 --> 35:55.687
APES.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.224
SO...

35:58.257 --> 36:01.793
I WILL BRING
THE REST BACK TOMORROW.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.662
- THE REST?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.731
- JUST PUT THEM ON MY CHARGE,
QUENTIN.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.267
- WHICH OF THESE
DO YOU RECOMMEND?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.302
- YOU THINK I WATCH THIS SHIT?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.371
ASK HIM.
HE'S SEEN THEM ALL.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.740
- LET ME SEE.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.608
YOUR ASS-LICKED PARK.

36:16.642 --> 36:17.876
IT'S AN EXCELLENT RIMMING SCENE

36:17.909 --> 36:20.746
BETWEEN A PALEONTOLOGIST
AND A STEGOSAURUS.

36:20.779 --> 36:23.415
FORREST DUMP.
SOME IDIOT GIVES NIXON

36:23.449 --> 36:24.950
A PLATE JOB IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.985
OH, DEFINITELY THIS ONE.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.421
ARM 'N HEAD IN.
IT'S GOT THE BEST FISTING SCENE

36:29.455 --> 36:31.290
ON AN ASTEROID HEADED
TO EARTH EVER FILMED.

36:31.323 --> 36:36.428
- WOW.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

36:36.462 --> 36:38.330
- NO, YOU ARE AMAZING.

36:38.364 --> 36:40.432
ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T CALL KNOWING
EVERY BOY-BANG FLICK

36:40.466 --> 36:42.368
EVER MADE
A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION

36:42.401 --> 36:43.402
TO CULTURAL LITERACY.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.536
- HEY, MISSY BIG-WORDS.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.305
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF LOVING PORN.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.307
PORNOGRAPHY HAPPENS
TO SERVE AN IMPORTANT

36:48.340 --> 36:49.741
AND PROFOUNDLY HUMANE SERVICE.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.310
- OH, THIS OUGHT TO BE GOOD.

36:51.343 --> 36:54.012
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE A GUY LIKE ME
RENTING A VIDEO, OKAY?

36:54.045 --> 36:55.981
WHAT ARE MY CHOICES?

36:56.014 --> 36:57.449
A MORONIC COMEDY,

36:57.483 --> 37:00.586
A COP DRAMA
STARRING SOME BRAINLESS ACTOR

37:00.619 --> 37:03.555
SHOOTING OFF HIS "WIDDLE" GUN,
OR...

37:03.589 --> 37:07.259
AN EXOTIC FANTASY LAND
FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL MEN,

37:07.293 --> 37:09.828
ALL OF WHOM ARE THERE FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PLEASING ME?

37:09.861 --> 37:11.563
- AHH.
- SEE, IT'S MY CHANCE

37:11.597 --> 37:12.864
TO BE BRIAN KINNEY.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.400
FUCK ANYONE I WANT.
- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

37:14.433 --> 37:15.667
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.035
SO YOU GET YOUR ROCKS OFF
TO SOME DREAM BOY,

37:17.068 --> 37:20.706
BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
IT'S A DIRTY BUSINESS.

37:20.739 --> 37:23.509
- WHAT, MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY?

37:23.542 --> 37:25.777
IT'S A LOT MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR MY JOB.

37:25.811 --> 37:29.381
ALL I DO IS CRUNCH NUMBERS SO
SOME ASSHOLE CAN CHEAT UNCLE SAM

37:29.415 --> 37:30.749
OUT OF A FEW EXTRA BUCKS.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.351
SEE, NOW THAT'S
WHAT I CALL PORN.

37:32.384 --> 37:33.819
THERE'S NO REDEEMING
SOCIAL VALUE WHATSOEVER.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.755
- I THINK YOU PROVIDE AN
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SERVICE.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.457
- PREPARING YOUR TAXES?

37:38.490 --> 37:40.526
YEAH, GREAT, WHEN'S THE LAST
TIME IT MADE YOU COME?

37:40.559 --> 37:43.762
- 1998.
I GOT A BIG REFUND.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.831
I GOTTA GET TO COURT.

38:10.856 --> 38:13.925

38:16.862 --> 38:19.765

38:19.798 --> 38:21.933
- ALL RIGHTY...7,000.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.502
- CHRIST, BRIAN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

38:23.535 --> 38:25.404
THERE'S ONLY 30 SECONDS LEFT.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.639
- OH, JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH.

38:27.673 --> 38:28.874
[computer beeping]
- HA! 8,000.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.109
- OH!
- TAKE IT. TAKE IT!

38:31.142 --> 38:32.778
- IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY, MA.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.812
- 9,000.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.880
- OH, GOD, NO.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.014
- I CAN'T LOOK.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.983
I CAN'T LOOK.
- NEITHER CAN I.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.551
YOU HAVE YOUR FINGER IN MY EYE.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.686
- I'M SORRY, HONEY.
- OW.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.588
TEN SECONDS.

38:48.727 --> 38:51.397
- NOBODY'S BIDDING!

38:53.499 --> 38:54.733
[computer beeping]
- LOOK.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.873

39:01.907 --> 39:03.542
- 10,000.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.577
- 10,000.

39:05.611 --> 39:08.847
both: 10,000!
10,000! 10,000!

39:08.880 --> 39:11.883

TO YELL AT YOU

39:11.917 --> 39:13.552
FOR READING THEM!

39:13.585 --> 39:16.021
OH, MY GOD!

39:16.054 --> 39:18.690
- OH, HONEY!

39:18.724 --> 39:20.992
- YOUR OWN STORE.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.528
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

39:22.561 --> 39:23.862
I KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO HAS HIS OWN STORE.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.499
FINALLY I CAN GET
A FABULOUS DISCOUNT

39:27.533 --> 39:30.068
ON SOMETHING I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO DESIRE TO OWN.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.903
[laughter]

39:31.937 --> 39:34.506
WHY COULDN'T YOUR DREAM
HAVE BEEN CASHMERE?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.643
- MY GRANDFATHER USED TO OWN
HIS OWN DRY GOODS STORE

39:37.676 --> 39:39.611
IN BROOKLYN,
AND HE USED TO SAY,

39:39.645 --> 39:42.948
"BETTER TO WORK FOR YOURSELF
THAN SOME MASHUGANA GONIFF."

39:42.981 --> 39:44.783
- HE KNEW
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT,

39:44.816 --> 39:48.954
EVEN IF NO ONE ELSE DID.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.456
- WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

39:50.489 --> 39:52.591
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE SO PATHETIC.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.925
- THANKS A LOT.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.827
- YOU PUT YOUR FUCKING LIFE UP
FOR AUCTION.

39:55.861 --> 39:59.164
I MEAN,
WHAT IF IT HADN'T WORKED OUT?

39:59.197 --> 40:01.099
- WELL, I GUESS
I'D HAVE NO MONEY

40:01.132 --> 40:03.034
AND NO JOB, NO NOTHING.

40:03.068 --> 40:08.039
- NOTHING BUT THE BIGGEST BALLS
IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.741
- TEDDY!
- TEDDY!

40:09.775 --> 40:13.445
- WHY, THEODORE SCHMIDT!

40:13.479 --> 40:16.448
- THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
GREASING THE OLD POLE.

40:16.482 --> 40:19.117
- ACTUALLY
I'VE FINALLY COME TO MY SENSES,

40:19.150 --> 40:22.187
SO TO SPEAK, AND I-I WANT
TO THANK YOU GUYS

40:22.220 --> 40:24.923
FOR HELPING ME
THROUGH ONE OF THE DARKEST

40:24.956 --> 40:27.158
AND MOST DIFFICULT TIMES
IN MY LIFE.

40:27.192 --> 40:30.028
- OH, BABY.
- BUT I'M FINALLY READY

40:30.061 --> 40:32.030
TO BECOME A PRODUCTIVE PART
OF SOCIETY AGAIN.

40:32.063 --> 40:34.165
I-I WANT TO GIVE BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY,

40:34.199 --> 40:38.203
FEEL A SENSE OF PRIDE,
OF PURPOSE.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.038
- THAT'S WONDERFUL,
SWEETHEART.

40:40.071 --> 40:45.977
- SO I HAVE DECIDED
TO QUIT MY NEW JOB...

40:46.011 --> 40:50.816
AND START
MY OWN PORNO WEBSITE.

40:50.849 --> 40:53.051
- WHAT?

40:53.084 --> 40:57.155

40:57.188 --> 40:59.491
- WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S FOLLOWING HIS DREAM.

40:59.525 --> 41:03.028

- WHAT?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.933
