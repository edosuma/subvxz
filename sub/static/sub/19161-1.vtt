00:03.213 --> 00:06.091
<i>Our story is about
a town, a small town,</i>

00:06.883 --> 00:08.927
<i>and the people who live
in the town.</i>

00:10.220 --> 00:12.430
<i>From a distance,
it presents itself</i>

00:12.639 --> 00:15.767
<i>like so many other small towns
all over the world...</i>

00:15.976 --> 00:16.726
<i>Safe.</i>

00:17.143 --> 00:17.852
<i>Decent.</i>

00:18.228 --> 00:18.979
<i>Innocent.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:21.356
<i>Get closer, though,</i>

00:22.065 --> 00:24.985
<i>and you start seeing
the shadows underneath.</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:28.571
<i>The name of our town
is Riverdale.</i>

00:39.541 --> 00:41.626
<i>And our story begins, I guess,</i>

00:41.835 --> 00:44.087
<i>with what the Blossom twins
did this summer.</i>

00:50.301 --> 00:52.595
<i>On the Fourth of July,
just after dawn,</i>

00:52.804 --> 00:55.390
<i>Jason and Cheryl Blossom
drove out to Sweetwater River</i>

00:55.598 --> 00:57.350
<i>for an early morning
boat ride.</i>

00:58.309 --> 00:59.561
Are you scared, Jason?

01:10.321 --> 01:12.157
<i>The next thing we
know happened for sure</i>

01:12.365 --> 01:13.575
<i>is that Dilton Doiley,</i>

01:13.783 --> 01:15.535
<i>who was leading Riverdale's
Boy Scout Troop</i>

01:15.744 --> 01:17.287
<i>on a bird watching expedition,</i>

01:17.495 --> 01:20.331
<i>came upon Cheryl
by the river's edge.</i>

01:23.251 --> 01:24.627
Jason...

01:33.678 --> 01:37.015
<i>Riverdale Police dragged
Sweetwater River
for Jason's body,</i>

01:37.223 --> 01:38.808
<i>but never found it.</i>

01:39.017 --> 01:40.268
If he is dead, Hal,

01:41.728 --> 01:44.105
I hope in those last moments
he suffered.

01:45.106 --> 01:47.859
May Jason Blossom
burn in hell.

01:50.361 --> 01:51.696
<i>So a week later,</i>

01:52.697 --> 01:55.241
<i>the Blossom family buried
an empty casket</i>

01:55.867 --> 01:58.119
<i>and Jason's death
was ruled an accident,</i>

01:58.995 --> 02:01.664
<i>as the story that Cheryl told
made the rounds.</i>

02:02.749 --> 02:04.918
<i>That Cheryl dropped
a glove in the water,</i>

02:05.585 --> 02:07.378
<i>and Jason reached
down to get it,</i>

02:08.046 --> 02:09.923
<i>and accidentally
tipped the boat,</i>

02:10.131 --> 02:12.467
<i>and panicked, and drowned.</i>

02:13.468 --> 02:17.388
<i>As for us,
we were still talking about
the "July Fourth tragedy"</i>

02:17.597 --> 02:19.307
<i>on the last day
of summer vacation,</i>

02:19.516 --> 02:22.352
<i>when a new mystery
rolled into town.</i>

02:29.025 --> 02:31.945
Now brace yourself.
The apartment's small,
a <i>pied-Ã -terre,</i>

02:32.153 --> 02:33.947
- but "quality, always."
- "Quality, always."

02:35.448 --> 02:37.826
Plus, it's the only piece
of property in my name

02:38.034 --> 02:39.285
and not your father's.

02:44.249 --> 02:45.667
Ms. Hermione!

02:46.209 --> 02:47.627
- Welcome home!
- Smithers!

02:47.836 --> 02:49.754
Oh, you are a sight
for sore eyes.

02:50.380 --> 02:52.632
- How was the ride?
- No traffic, thank God.

02:52.841 --> 02:54.551
Smithers, I'd like
to introduce you

02:54.759 --> 02:56.469
to my daughter, Veronica.

02:56.928 --> 02:59.013
- It's a pleasure, miss.
- Hi.

02:59.222 --> 03:00.515
- I'll get the bags.
- Would you?

03:01.307 --> 03:03.351
Oh, and would you like
some menus, ma'am,
so you can order in?

03:03.518 --> 03:05.103
Oh, no.
I have been craving

03:05.311 --> 03:07.021
one of Pop Tate's
cheeseburgers
since noon.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.857
Is his Chock'lit Shoppe
still open?

03:09.065 --> 03:12.485
What is a Chock'lit Shoppe
and why does it sell burgers?

03:24.789 --> 03:26.833
Are you excited? Nervous?

03:28.126 --> 03:31.254
Both. I haven't seen him
all summer.

03:31.462 --> 03:33.256
Which is why nerves
are acceptable,

03:33.464 --> 03:35.550
but we agreed, Betty...
It's time.

03:36.634 --> 03:38.303
You like him, he likes you.

03:38.511 --> 03:40.388
Well, then why, Kevin,

03:40.597 --> 03:42.307
hasn't he ever said
or done anything?

03:42.515 --> 03:45.143
Because Archie's swell,

03:45.351 --> 03:47.103
but like most
millennial straight guys,

03:47.312 --> 03:48.354
he needs to be told
what he wants.

03:48.563 --> 03:50.315
So tell him, finally.

03:50.523 --> 03:51.983
Well, we'll see.
I mean, it depends.

03:52.192 --> 03:54.235
Oh, my God!

03:55.069 --> 03:55.695
What?

03:56.529 --> 03:59.324
Game-changer.
Archie got hot!

04:00.658 --> 04:02.118
He's got abs now.

04:02.994 --> 04:07.248
Six more reasons for you
to take that ginger bull
by the horns tonight.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.375
<i>So, what was the highlight?</i>

04:09.751 --> 04:10.919
Of my internship?

04:11.252 --> 04:14.339
The Toni Morrison
book release party
I organized, by far.

04:14.923 --> 04:16.257
At the end of the night,
Toni Morrison,

04:16.466 --> 04:17.884
who is, as you know,

04:18.092 --> 04:20.261
- my literary hero,
says to me...
- Yes. Yes.

04:20.970 --> 04:22.639
"Don't rush this time, Betty.

04:22.847 --> 04:25.516
"It goes by so fast
at your age.

04:25.725 --> 04:27.727
"One summer
can change everything."

04:29.187 --> 04:32.190
Wow. That's so true.

04:32.398 --> 04:33.524
How was working for your dad?

04:33.733 --> 04:36.277
It was...
Pouring concrete,

04:36.486 --> 04:38.321
every day, all day long.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.408
To pass time,
I would start composing

04:42.617 --> 04:43.993
these poems, in my head.

04:44.202 --> 04:45.370
And at night, I'd go home,
I'd write them down...

04:45.578 --> 04:46.871
You don't even
like reading poetry.

04:47.080 --> 04:50.416
They weren't poems,
they were song lyrics.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.379
And working on them
made me feel like...

04:55.546 --> 04:56.965
What, Archie?

04:57.173 --> 04:58.216
It made me feel like

04:58.424 --> 05:00.551
I'd finally broken through
to something real.

05:01.719 --> 05:02.637
About my life

05:02.845 --> 05:04.222
and what I should be trying
to do with it.

05:05.390 --> 05:06.224
Music.

05:06.641 --> 05:08.643
Starting this year, tomorrow.

05:09.102 --> 05:10.353
Amazing.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.773
Will you ask Ms. Grundy
to tutor you?

05:14.065 --> 05:15.608
- I'm not sure, maybe.
- What about football?

05:15.817 --> 05:17.527
- Can you do both?
- I'll try out, at least.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.362
- Well, have you told your dad?
- No.

05:19.904 --> 05:20.947
Until I've got things
more figured out,

05:21.155 --> 05:22.657
you're the only person
I'm telling, okay?

05:24.742 --> 05:26.452
Well, I'd love to hear
them sometime.

05:26.995 --> 05:28.121
Your songs.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.205
- Yeah?
- Yes.

05:29.414 --> 05:31.040
Yeah, I'm finishing
a couple of demos tonight.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.584
Great. Also...

05:34.627 --> 05:36.170
I've been thinking

05:36.754 --> 05:38.589
about us, Archie,

05:39.090 --> 05:42.677
and our friendship,
and how it's time we...

05:57.942 --> 05:59.736
I called in an order,
for Lodge?

05:59.944 --> 06:01.112
Two burgers,
yeah, almost ready,

06:01.321 --> 06:02.363
but you gotta wait.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.491
- Hi.
- Hey.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.202
How are the onion rings here?

06:08.411 --> 06:09.662
So good.

06:09.871 --> 06:11.497
Can we get some onion rings,
too, please?

06:11.706 --> 06:13.166
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.209
My mom and I
just moved here, so...

06:15.376 --> 06:16.961
- From where?
- New York.

06:17.420 --> 06:18.129
Wow.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.132
Do you guys go to Riverdale?

06:21.341 --> 06:23.176
- We do. Both of us. Together.
- We're sophomores.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.552
Me too.

06:25.053 --> 06:27.513
- I'm filled with dread.
- Why is that?

06:28.056 --> 06:30.475
Are you familiar with the
works of Truman Capote?

06:31.601 --> 06:32.977
I'm <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>

06:33.186 --> 06:34.896
but this place is strictly <i>In Cold Blood.</i>

06:38.149 --> 06:39.233
Veronica Lodge.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.526
Archie Andrews.

06:42.028 --> 06:43.154
Uh, this is Betty Cooper.

06:44.030 --> 06:46.157
Wait, are you...

06:46.366 --> 06:49.035
Supposed to give you
your tour tomorrow? Yes.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.329
I'm your peer mentor.

06:51.537 --> 06:52.747
Do you want to join us?

06:52.955 --> 06:54.832
Hey, maybe we can
un-fill you with dread.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.584
My mom's waiting for me.

06:57.377 --> 06:59.170
But, to be continued.

06:59.379 --> 07:00.296
Yeah.

07:04.092 --> 07:06.219
- What were you saying?
- Nothing.

07:08.930 --> 07:11.974
Hey, Dad. First day of school
and I'm already late.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.851
Hey, Vegas.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.772
Hey, you, uh,
you stopping by
the site later?

07:18.189 --> 07:19.440
Dad, it's my first day.

07:19.649 --> 07:21.109
Oh, we got to get you going
in the office,

07:21.317 --> 07:22.902
so next summer
you're not on the crew.

07:24.404 --> 07:25.988
Well, I can't.
I've got football tryouts.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.242
Or is that not okay?

07:29.450 --> 07:32.787
No, it's, uh...
It's okay. Good luck.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.624
Hmm.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.379
Betty.
This coming year
is critical for colleges.

07:41.587 --> 07:42.880
Grades are important,

07:43.089 --> 07:44.882
extracurriculars, athletics.

07:45.091 --> 07:46.968
Maintaining
a decent character

07:47.135 --> 07:49.554
is hugely important,
they do look at that.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.013
Mom, I'm a sophomore.

07:51.222 --> 07:53.057
You've accomplished so much,

07:53.266 --> 07:55.518
I don't want anything
jeopardizing that.

07:57.228 --> 07:59.147
I mean, just think
of your poor sister.

08:00.231 --> 08:01.315
She was such a shining star

08:01.524 --> 08:02.900
before she let
that Blossom boy ruin her.

08:03.109 --> 08:04.444
Mom, I'm not Polly.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.529
You missed curfew last night.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.239
By seven minutes.

08:08.448 --> 08:10.575
I was with Archie,
who has red hair, yes,

08:10.783 --> 08:13.119
but is nothing
like Jason Blossom.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.330
Oh, but sweetie, all boys
are like Jason Blossom.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.876
I love you so much,
Elizabeth.

08:21.586 --> 08:23.921
I just need you
to be smart, okay?

08:26.090 --> 08:27.341
And stay...

08:28.092 --> 08:29.177
Focused.

08:30.595 --> 08:31.846
I refilled your Adderall.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.558
Seems you forgot
to pick up your prescription.

08:49.864 --> 08:52.325
Bro, you are ready
for football.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.993
I'm not kidding you, dude.
You got ripped.

08:54.202 --> 08:55.745
Dude, you're a beast.
Look at this arm, it's diesel!

08:55.953 --> 08:57.788
How much are you benching,
like 220? 225?

08:57.997 --> 08:59.207
You got to give me
some tips, man.

08:59.415 --> 09:01.501
Romanian deadlifts, right?
Taking some T?

09:02.126 --> 09:03.377
Ginseng?

09:03.836 --> 09:04.962
Maca root?

09:06.005 --> 09:07.131
<i>Tribulus terrestris?</i>

09:07.340 --> 09:08.633
It's from working
construction, Reg.

09:08.841 --> 09:10.426
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yo, Moose.

09:11.177 --> 09:12.637
- Look who grew up
over the summer.
Hey!

09:12.845 --> 09:13.971
Yo,
be honest with me.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.432
You work on any houses?
Any private homes?

09:16.641 --> 09:17.683
Yeah, a couple.

09:17.892 --> 09:20.561
Did you tap some cougar ass
this summer?

09:20.770 --> 09:22.313
You know what,
I think that's more a fantasy

09:22.522 --> 09:24.148
from your wank-bank, Reggie.

09:24.357 --> 09:26.442
- I'll catch you guys soon.
- Peace out, brother.

09:26.651 --> 09:28.611
- Totally did it, bro.
- He totally did it.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.280
So, I usually start off
my tours

09:31.489 --> 09:33.908
with a little history
and context.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.786
Riverdale High first opened
its doors in 1941 and...

09:36.994 --> 09:39.455
And hasn't been redecorated
since, apparently.

09:40.206 --> 09:41.541
Honestly, I feel
like I'm wandering

09:41.749 --> 09:43.668
through the lost epilogue
of <i>Our Town.</i>

09:44.627 --> 09:45.586
Uh-huh.

09:45.795 --> 09:47.880
So what's the social scene
like here? Any night clubs?

09:48.381 --> 09:50.049
A strip club
called the Ho Zone

09:50.258 --> 09:52.426
and a tragic gay bar
called Innuendo.

09:52.635 --> 09:53.719
Friday nights, football games

09:53.928 --> 09:55.846
and then tailgate parties
at the Mallmart parking lot.

09:56.055 --> 09:57.557
Saturday night is movie night,

09:57.765 --> 09:58.724
regardless of what's playing
at the Bijou,

09:58.933 --> 09:59.809
and you better
get there early,

10:00.017 --> 10:01.519
because we don't have
reserved seating in Riverdale.

10:01.727 --> 10:05.231
And Sunday nights...
Thank God for HBO.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.149
Veronica Lodge, Kevin Keller.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.819
- Veronica's new here.
Kevin is...
- ...gay, thank God.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.195
Let's be best friends.

10:11.404 --> 10:12.822
Is it true what they say
about your dad?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.867
That he's the devil incarnate?

10:18.119 --> 10:19.328
I stand by my father.

10:20.413 --> 10:21.539
Does everyone here know?

10:25.209 --> 10:27.211
Wonderful. Ten minutes in
and I'm already

10:27.420 --> 10:28.838
the <i>Blue Jasmine</i>
of Riverdale High.

10:30.047 --> 10:30.756
What?

10:51.319 --> 10:52.653
Mm-mm.

10:52.862 --> 10:55.656
Excuse me,
this is a closed rehearsal.

10:55.865 --> 10:57.074
I'm sorry, I...

10:58.409 --> 10:59.493
Josie, right?

11:00.369 --> 11:01.704
I was hoping
I could talk to you

11:01.912 --> 11:03.122
about some songs that I wrote?

11:03.331 --> 11:05.207
Let me just
stop you right there.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.752
You're staring
at our pussycat ears,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.086
which is rude,

11:09.295 --> 11:12.298
but let me break it,
and them, down for you.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.759
The Pussycats
are building a brand,

11:14.967 --> 11:18.679
creating a signature look,
okay? We're telling a story.

11:19.138 --> 11:22.266
Last year, we won
Rockland County's
Battle of the Bands.

11:22.475 --> 11:23.392
That we did.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.896
This year, we'd like to build
on that success,

11:27.104 --> 11:29.440
continue telling our story

11:29.982 --> 11:31.901
with songs we write.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.153
I get that. It's just...

11:34.362 --> 11:36.781
Read my glossed lips,

11:36.989 --> 11:38.366
Justin Gingerlake.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.076
Not...

11:40.618 --> 11:41.619
Gonna...

11:42.161 --> 11:43.162
Happen.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.625
Oh, and of course there's
the Back-to-School

11:47.833 --> 11:49.293
- semiformal dance
this weekend.
- Oh!

11:49.710 --> 11:51.253
There's the hottie
we were with last night.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.923
The red-headed Ansel Elgort.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.383
Is he your boyfriend?

11:55.591 --> 11:57.259
- No, he's straight.
- No, we're just friends.

11:58.636 --> 12:00.971
In that case,
mind putting in a word?

12:01.180 --> 12:03.057
I've tried every flavor of boy
but orange.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.850
Actually, to clarify...

12:05.059 --> 12:06.686
Betty and Archie
aren't dating,

12:06.894 --> 12:08.312
but they are endgame.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.357
You should ask him
to the semiformal then.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.901
She should, but I heard
it might be getting canceled.

12:14.068 --> 12:15.403
Because of what happened
to Jason.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.446
They're gonna tell us
at the assembly.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.657
Who's Jason
and what happened to him?

12:20.491 --> 12:22.660
<i>Thank you
for that moment of silence.</i>

12:22.868 --> 12:24.328
<i>Many of you were lucky enough</i>

12:24.537 --> 12:26.664
<i>to have known
my brother personally.</i>

12:26.872 --> 12:30.710
<i>Each and every one of you
meant the world to Jason.</i>

12:30.918 --> 12:32.586
<i>I loved my brother.</i>

12:32.795 --> 12:35.589
<i>He was and always will be
my soulmate.</i>

12:36.507 --> 12:37.591
<i>So I speak with the confidence</i>

12:37.800 --> 12:39.593
<i>only a twin could have...</i>

12:39.802 --> 12:42.972
<i>Jason wouldn't want us
to spend the year mourning.</i>

12:43.889 --> 12:47.810
<i>Jason would want us
to move on with our lives.</i>

12:48.018 --> 12:49.395
<i>Which is why I've asked
the School Board</i>

12:49.603 --> 12:51.480
<i>not to cancel
the Back-to-School semiformal.</i>

12:53.232 --> 12:54.316
<i>But rather, to let us use it</i>

12:54.525 --> 12:57.153
<i>as a way
to heal, collectively,</i>

12:57.361 --> 13:00.990
<i>and celebrate my brother's
too, too short life
on this mortal coil.</i>

13:02.158 --> 13:03.367
<i>Thank you all.</i>

13:09.623 --> 13:11.834
- Ms. Grundy? Hey.
- Archie.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.587
What are you doing
walking in this heat?

13:15.254 --> 13:16.547
Um... Building character?

13:19.216 --> 13:20.259
Do you want a ride?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.666
Ms. Grundy. Ms. Grundy.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.878
Geraldine.

13:58.339 --> 13:59.882
What can I do for you,
Mr. Andrews?

14:01.133 --> 14:02.885
Can we talk,
Ms. Grundy, please?

14:03.803 --> 14:06.096
It depends. About what?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.016
Music.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.519
You're the music teacher.
Can we talk about music?

14:11.727 --> 14:12.937
Of course.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.189
Make an appointment.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.609
During my office hours,
my official office hours.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.536
Hermione Lodge.

14:30.454 --> 14:33.499
Well, my day just got
a lot more interesting.

14:33.749 --> 14:34.500
Hello, Fred.

14:35.251 --> 14:36.168
How are you?

14:36.877 --> 14:37.711
Surprised.

14:39.839 --> 14:41.715
Can I get you anything?
Would you like a water?

14:41.924 --> 14:42.675
A job.

14:44.385 --> 14:45.427
I saw on your website

14:45.636 --> 14:47.388
that you are looking
for a seasonal hire,

14:48.597 --> 14:49.682
someone to help
with the books?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.393
Yeah, my guy's
on paternity leave.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.020
You know, I think
my daughter's going to school

14:55.229 --> 14:58.357
with your son,
isn't that funny?

14:59.024 --> 15:00.776
We'll have to tell them
that we knew each other,

15:00.985 --> 15:03.112
that we even dated,
for a little while...

15:03.863 --> 15:06.448
- Well, at least until I...
- ...chose the rich kid.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.784
And now,
a reversal of fortune.

15:11.662 --> 15:12.663
How's Mary doing?

15:13.247 --> 15:14.665
She's in Chicago.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.084
We split up. We're civil.

15:17.293 --> 15:18.627
How about you?

15:19.336 --> 15:21.547
How are you
holding up? Really?

15:23.716 --> 15:25.092
I have a little money saved.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.804
I was praying that someone
in Riverdale,

15:30.306 --> 15:31.557
maybe an old friend,

15:32.182 --> 15:34.101
would be willing to give me
the benefit of the doubt.

15:35.019 --> 15:36.562
If it were up to me.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.481
Isn't it up to you?
It's your company.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.735
Well, I have clients.

15:43.027 --> 15:44.987
I can't very well
have Hermione Lodge,

15:45.195 --> 15:46.530
the wife of Hiram Lodge,

15:46.739 --> 15:48.407
on trial for fraud
and embezzlement,

15:48.616 --> 15:50.367
balancing my books.

15:50.826 --> 15:51.911
Can I?

15:52.870 --> 15:53.913
No.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.291
I suppose you can't.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.229
Can I join?

16:20.356 --> 16:20.981
Yeah.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.233
What are we doing?

16:23.442 --> 16:24.860
Listening to one
of Archie's songs.

16:25.069 --> 16:26.528
I thought we were going
to have to pretend

16:26.737 --> 16:29.239
to like it, but it's actually
really good.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.367
Wait, that was you singing?

16:31.575 --> 16:33.452
- Something you wrote?
- It's rough.

16:33.661 --> 16:34.745
No, it's great.

16:34.954 --> 16:37.289
It's incredible, actually,
the little snippet I heard.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.708
Is that your thing? Music?

16:39.917 --> 16:41.543
Are you doing something
with that?

16:42.044 --> 16:43.295
Yeah, that's the plan.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.464
So how's your
first day going? Good?

16:46.090 --> 16:47.841
Not to be
a complete narcissist,

16:48.050 --> 16:49.426
but I thought people
would be more...

16:49.635 --> 16:50.719
Obsessed with you?

16:51.095 --> 16:53.305
Any other year,
you'd be trending number one,
for sure.

16:53.514 --> 16:55.265
This year, though,
it's all about Cheryl

16:55.474 --> 16:57.226
trying to win
the Best Supporting Psycho
Oscar

16:57.434 --> 17:00.354
for her role
as Riverdale High's
bereaved Red Widow.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.147
Hey, I should go.
I got that meeting with Grundy

17:02.356 --> 17:03.565
and then football tryouts, so.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.360
You play football, too?
What don't you do?

17:08.112 --> 17:09.446
Before you ask,
Blue Jasmine, no,

17:09.655 --> 17:10.864
she has not invited him
to the dance yet...

17:11.031 --> 17:12.449
Not yet, and don't
talk about Archie.

17:12.658 --> 17:15.285
Veronica Lodge,
I'd heard whisperings.

17:15.494 --> 17:18.080
I'm Cheryl Blossom, may I sit?

17:18.288 --> 17:19.248
Betty, would you mind?

17:22.584 --> 17:25.379
So, what are you three hens
gossiping about?

17:25.754 --> 17:28.465
Archie's Efron-esque emergence
from the chrysalis of puberty?

17:30.592 --> 17:32.302
Extracurriculars.

17:32.511 --> 17:33.887
Weatherbee wants me
to sign up for a few.

17:34.471 --> 17:36.557
Cheerleading. You must.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.434
I'm senior captain
of the River Vixens.

17:39.018 --> 17:40.602
Is cheerleading still a thing?

17:40.811 --> 17:42.730
Is being the Gay Best Friend
still a thing?

17:43.939 --> 17:48.068
Some people say it's retro,
I say it's eternal and iconic.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.654
At Spence, I sat at the top
of the Elites' pyramid.

17:50.863 --> 17:51.655
I'm in.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.657
Betty, you're trying out, too.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.994
Of course,
anyone's welcome to try out,

17:57.202 --> 17:58.746
but Betty's already
got so much

17:58.954 --> 18:00.330
on her plate right now

18:00.539 --> 18:02.416
and being a Vixen
is kind of a full-time thing.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.376
But open to all!

18:05.711 --> 18:07.254
Follow me on Twitter
and I'll do the same.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.923
My handle is @cherylbombshell.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.595
Okay. Go ahead and hate
on cheerleading,

18:14.803 --> 18:15.929
but if Hipster Prince Harry...

18:16.096 --> 18:17.598
I'd love to be a cheerleader.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.185
It would look great
on my college applications.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.395
But last year,
when I tried out,

18:23.604 --> 18:25.022
Cheryl said I was too fat.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.565
"Too season 5 Betty Draper."

18:26.774 --> 18:28.108
It was a great line,

18:28.317 --> 18:30.152
but not at all true.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.405
Well, you're a total
smoke show now.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.656
I mean it.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.743
As hot and as smart
as you are,

18:37.951 --> 18:40.537
you should be the
Queen Bey of this drab hive.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.999
Look, if you want
to be a River Vixen,

18:44.208 --> 18:46.085
I'll help you prep.
I have moves.

18:48.170 --> 18:52.049
Okay. You know what?
Show me your moves.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.477
They're...

19:04.603 --> 19:05.687
Very real,

19:06.939 --> 19:08.065
very personal.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.900
I took your advice
and wrote them down.

19:10.109 --> 19:11.235
Polished them.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.821
But I was wondering maybe
if you could help me...

19:14.321 --> 19:17.157
With what, Archie?

19:17.366 --> 19:18.492
You went to Juilliard,
Ms. Grundy.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.285
There is no one else
in Riverdale
I can take lessons from.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.703
Believe me, I've looked.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.747
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.669
I don't think we should
be alone together.

19:31.755 --> 19:35.592
If this is you trying
to restart something

19:35.801 --> 19:38.095
that never should've
started in the first...

19:38.303 --> 19:41.140
No, it's not.
It is about the music.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.644
But it's also...

19:48.939 --> 19:49.857
Come on,
I need to be able

19:50.065 --> 19:51.483
to talk about what happened
with someone.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.235
We heard what we heard

19:53.443 --> 19:54.695
and afterwards,
we didn't do anything.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.572
We didn't say anything.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.832
We heard fireworks.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.501
Who's lighting fireworks
at 6:00 in the morning?

20:09.710 --> 20:12.629
How would we explain
why we were together

20:12.838 --> 20:15.132
at Sweetwater River
at 6:00 a.m.
on the Fourth of July?

20:16.341 --> 20:17.259
And you're right.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.262
We didn't say anything.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.933
We're both going to have to
live with that choice.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.061
Do you understand?

20:29.980 --> 20:31.857
I think you should
pursue your music,

20:33.150 --> 20:34.359
but not with me.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.996
We're dynamite!

20:46.205 --> 20:48.165
We'll take you down,

20:48.373 --> 20:50.417
and fight the fight!

20:50.626 --> 20:52.586
Whoo! Go, Bulldogs!

20:53.378 --> 20:54.755
Hmm.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.674
Ladies, where's the heat?
Where's the sizzle?

20:58.550 --> 21:00.969
Well, you haven't seen
our big finish yet.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.555
Don't freak out.
Just trust me.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.405
Check your
sell-by date, ladies,

21:20.614 --> 21:24.201
faux lesbian kissing
hasn't been taboo since 1994.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.454
So let's see if you do better
with the interview portion
of our audition.

21:27.996 --> 21:29.915
Betty,
how's your sister doing?

21:31.375 --> 21:34.086
Um, Polly's fine,
thanks for asking.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.255
Veronica, has Betty told you
about her sister yet?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.715
- Uh, no.
- Go ahead, Betty.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.927
Tell Veronica
about your sister
and my dear brother.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.053
Polly and Jason dated.

21:43.262 --> 21:44.763
I wouldn't say "dated".

21:45.472 --> 21:47.891
- It didn't end well.
- In fact,

21:48.308 --> 21:51.019
Jason's probably why
your sister had
a nervous breakdown

21:51.228 --> 21:53.522
and now lives in a group home,
isn't it?

21:53.730 --> 21:54.731
That's what my parents think.

21:55.399 --> 21:57.150
What do you have to say
about that, Betty?

21:57.359 --> 21:59.361
Go ahead, the floor is yours.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.488
Whatever you've been dying
to spew about Jason

22:01.697 --> 22:04.199
and how he treated Polly,
unleash it.

22:04.408 --> 22:06.660
Destroy me. Tear me a new one.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.662
Rip me to shreds.
Annihilate me.

22:08.870 --> 22:09.830
I just...

22:10.998 --> 22:12.082
Finally.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.922
I just wanted
to say I'm sorry

22:20.632 --> 22:22.384
about what happened to Jason.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.636
I can't even imagine
what you and your family

22:24.845 --> 22:25.846
must be going through.

22:27.681 --> 22:28.807
Right.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.936
Veronica,
welcome to the River Vixens.

22:33.145 --> 22:36.064
Betty, better luck next time.

22:37.816 --> 22:41.069
Wait, what? Why?

22:41.987 --> 22:43.989
Because you couldn't bully
Betty into being a bitch?

22:44.281 --> 22:46.283
I need girls with fire
on my squad.

22:47.617 --> 22:50.162
I know what you need, Cheryl,

22:50.370 --> 22:51.997
because I know who you are.

22:52.539 --> 22:55.625
You would rather
people fear
than like you,

22:55.834 --> 22:57.961
so you traffic
in terror and intimidation.

22:58.712 --> 23:01.298
You're rich, so you've never
been held accountable,

23:01.798 --> 23:03.175
but I'm living proof.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.136
That certainty,
that entitlement

23:06.345 --> 23:07.763
you wear on your head
like a crown?

23:08.680 --> 23:09.765
It won't last.

23:10.098 --> 23:12.768
Eventually, there will be
a reckoning.

23:14.936 --> 23:15.729
Or...

23:16.938 --> 23:19.608
Maybe that reckoning
is now.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.277
And maybe, that reckoning...

23:23.695 --> 23:24.821
Is me.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.200
Betty and I come
as a matching set.

23:28.408 --> 23:30.160
You want one,
you take us both.

23:31.119 --> 23:32.287
You wanted fire?

23:32.954 --> 23:36.625
Sorry, Cherylbombshell,
my specialty's ice.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.255
Go, get around him.
Get around him.

23:44.091 --> 23:45.008
Let's move.

23:45.509 --> 23:46.510
Andrews!

23:50.889 --> 23:52.391
There we go. Looking good.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.853
- What's up, Coach?
- Here.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.237
- This is Jason's number.
- It's yours now.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.364
Usually, sophomores,
they only play JV.

24:07.572 --> 24:09.574
This year, we've got
an open spot in varsity.

24:09.783 --> 24:12.536
From what you've
been showing us,
well, I want you to fill it.

24:12.828 --> 24:16.081
Varsity's got
longer practices.

24:16.289 --> 24:17.374
More away games.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.917
Yeah, bigger commitment, yeah.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.794
Well, I need to think
about it, Coach. I...

24:21.461 --> 24:22.879
Oh, what, you got
something better to do?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.633
My dad's company.

24:26.842 --> 24:28.135
It's our family business,

24:28.343 --> 24:29.219
and he's sort of counting
on me to help out

24:29.428 --> 24:30.512
after school, on weekends...

24:30.720 --> 24:31.513
Hold up, Jackson,
hold the ball.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.724
You know what,
why don't you sleep on it.

24:35.434 --> 24:36.726
Let's go. Bring it in, guys.
Come on.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.530
Perfect.

24:48.738 --> 24:50.907
Very Betty Draper, season 1.

24:56.163 --> 24:57.372
Veronica.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.710
Why did...
Why did you defend me?

25:03.462 --> 25:06.381
I know the crowd
you ran with
in New York.

25:07.299 --> 25:10.802
Why are you being so... Nice?

25:11.887 --> 25:13.930
When my father got arrested,

25:14.514 --> 25:16.933
it was the worst thing ever.

25:17.893 --> 25:20.437
All these trolls
started writing

25:20.645 --> 25:22.105
horrible things about us.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.609
We'd get letters and e-mails
saying that

25:26.318 --> 25:27.611
my dad was a thief,

25:28.403 --> 25:30.238
my mom
was a clueless socialite,

25:30.447 --> 25:34.075
and that I was
the spoiled rich-bitch
ice princess.

25:35.327 --> 25:38.205
And what hurt the most
about it was...

25:38.955 --> 25:42.626
The things the trolls
were writing were true.

25:43.919 --> 25:46.796
I was like Cheryl.
I was worse than Cheryl.

25:47.923 --> 25:51.301
So, when my mom said
we were moving to Riverdale,

25:51.968 --> 25:53.220
I made a pact with myself

25:54.387 --> 25:58.183
to use this
as an opportunity
to become

25:58.391 --> 26:02.145
maybe, hopefully,
a better version of myself.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.106
That's a lot of pressure.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.072
When Polly and Jason
got together...

26:12.948 --> 26:15.116
It meant everything to her

26:15.325 --> 26:16.826
and nothing to him,

26:18.453 --> 26:20.789
and...

26:20.997 --> 26:24.751
And things got super
intense and weird and toxic

26:24.918 --> 26:26.753
and my mom turned on Polly.

26:27.837 --> 26:30.006
Said Polly wasn't
her daughter anymore,

26:30.215 --> 26:32.300
said all these
awful things to her.

26:33.093 --> 26:35.011
Jason hurt Polly,

26:37.556 --> 26:39.599
but it's my mom who broke her.

26:45.730 --> 26:46.856
Archie.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.733
- You're so doing this.
- What?

26:48.942 --> 26:50.735
Slaying your dragons,
Betty Cooper, one by one.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.448
- Hi, Teen Outlander.
- Hey.

26:56.241 --> 26:57.367
Nice outfits.

26:57.576 --> 27:00.912
Betty here has something
she wants to ask you

27:01.121 --> 27:02.289
about the
Back-to-School dance.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.208
Go on, Betty, ask.

27:06.876 --> 27:10.422
I was wondering
if you wanted
to come

27:10.630 --> 27:13.383
with both of us.

27:13.592 --> 27:14.843
- Huh?
- What?

27:16.261 --> 27:18.305
It's your first dance
at Riverdale.

27:18.513 --> 27:19.598
You should have
someone to go with,

27:19.806 --> 27:21.391
even if it's just a friend.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.520
I mean, I'd love to.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.231
I'm not really in the
headspace for a dance.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.442
Oh. That's okay.

27:31.735 --> 27:35.280
Totally unacceptable,
Archiekins.
We need an escort.

27:36.072 --> 27:38.450
Take a break from being
a tortured musical genius

27:38.658 --> 27:40.410
and come spend
a blissful evening

27:40.619 --> 27:44.706
with not one, but two
newly-minted River Vixens.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.416
We'll text you time and place.

27:47.167 --> 27:50.420
Okay. Yeah, okay.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.088
- Bye.
- Bye.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.109
What is that?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.447
I made the cheerleading squad.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.492
Cheryl Blossom's
cheerleading squad?

28:22.035 --> 28:24.120
After what Jason did to Polly?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.290
No, I'm sorry.
I won't allow it.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.668
Take that off right now.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.047
- No.
- What did you say to me?

28:35.131 --> 28:37.759
I do everything for everyone.

28:38.343 --> 28:40.470
Everything to be perfect.

28:40.929 --> 28:44.140
The perfect daughter,
the perfect sister,
the perfect student...

28:45.016 --> 28:47.519
Can't I do this one thing
just for me?

28:47.727 --> 28:48.645
- Wait.
- Get out of my way.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.271
- Where are you going?
- To buy a dress.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.565
Because guess what?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.735
I'm also gong to the dance
with Archie.

28:57.195 --> 28:58.905
And Veronica.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.782
Wait. Hermione Lodge's
daughter?

29:01.241 --> 29:03.034
She's actually really nice.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.577
And trying
to be a good person.

29:04.786 --> 29:05.954
You think so?

29:06.371 --> 29:07.706
You think she's going to be
your friend?

29:08.373 --> 29:09.958
Let me tell you something.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.711
Girls like Cheryl
and Veronica Lodge,

29:12.919 --> 29:14.087
they don't like girls like us.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.755
I don't want to hear it, Mom.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.842
It's happening. I'm going.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.012
Thank you, Smithers.

29:23.221 --> 29:24.764
As always, you're a godsend.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.725
Happy to help, Ms. Hermione.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.393
Unlike the rest of Riverdale.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.687
- Hmm.
- What's that?

29:31.438 --> 29:32.731
Oh. Um...

29:32.939 --> 29:35.400
A spot of good news.
The car service

29:35.608 --> 29:37.902
found and dropped off
your missing bag.

29:40.196 --> 29:41.489
Missing bag?

29:50.582 --> 29:54.544
Oh, Hiram...
What have you done?

30:10.602 --> 30:13.897
I, um... I got a call
from your coach today.

30:14.689 --> 30:15.440
He's under the impression

30:15.648 --> 30:17.192
that you can't play
varsity football

30:17.400 --> 30:19.569
because I'm making you
work for me.

30:20.111 --> 30:22.238
Which is odd,
because you made it
seem like

30:22.447 --> 30:23.531
you couldn't work for me

30:23.740 --> 30:24.949
because you were
playing football.

30:25.158 --> 30:27.452
So my first question is...

30:28.828 --> 30:30.914
Who are you lying to?

30:31.790 --> 30:33.082
Me or your coach?

30:35.919 --> 30:36.836
Neither.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.299
Both.

30:46.346 --> 30:47.972
Dad...

30:50.225 --> 30:51.643
I want to study music,

30:52.519 --> 30:53.853
I want to write music.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.272
Football takes you to college.

30:56.481 --> 30:58.149
College takes you
to business school.

30:58.358 --> 31:00.401
- Business school...
- Takes me back here.

31:00.610 --> 31:02.237
To work for you in Riverdale.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.614
Not for me, with me.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.076
And eventually
for yourself, son.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.119
The company would be yours.

31:12.372 --> 31:13.706
No disrespect, Dad,

31:16.835 --> 31:18.419
but I don't want it.

31:19.796 --> 31:21.673
Three months ago, you did.

31:23.216 --> 31:24.551
What happened?

31:25.844 --> 31:29.472
I've changed.
Everything's changed.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.140
This summer...

31:32.183 --> 31:33.476
This summer what?

31:38.857 --> 31:39.816
That's it?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.360
We don't talk anymore?

31:45.363 --> 31:46.197
Dad.

31:46.531 --> 31:49.075
I would never force you
to play football.

31:50.535 --> 31:52.453
I don't care
if you play football.

31:53.413 --> 31:57.292
And you don't have to work
with me or for me, ever again.

31:58.877 --> 32:01.004
But some advice, man-to-man?

32:01.212 --> 32:03.548
These decisions
that you're making now, son,

32:04.757 --> 32:05.842
they have consequences.

32:06.050 --> 32:07.218
They go on to form who you are

32:07.427 --> 32:09.095
and who you'll become.

32:09.512 --> 32:10.930
Whatever you decide,

32:11.806 --> 32:15.268
be confident enough in it
that you don't have to lie.

32:40.793 --> 32:42.253
Well, it's not the Met Ball.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.300
Hey. When do you have
to let Coach Clayton

32:47.508 --> 32:49.385
- know about football?
- This weekend.

32:49.594 --> 32:52.305
Guys, can't we just
liberate ourselves

32:52.513 --> 32:55.475
from the tired dichotomy
of jock/artist?

32:55.683 --> 32:58.478
Can't we, in this post
James Franco world,

32:58.645 --> 33:00.772
be all things at once?

33:00.980 --> 33:02.440
I've been working
on it, Veronica.

33:03.858 --> 33:07.236
Work faster.
I'm getting punch.

33:07.904 --> 33:08.905
You got this.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.409
It's about following
your heart, right?

33:15.787 --> 33:18.706
What does your heart say?
Music or football?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.001
Betty, will you give me
one minute?

33:22.210 --> 33:23.169
And I promise,
when I get back,

33:23.378 --> 33:24.754
I'll be a much
better date, okay?

33:24.963 --> 33:26.172
I have a plan.

33:29.175 --> 33:31.177
Betty, you will not believe
who just propositioned me

33:31.386 --> 33:33.012
in the bathroom.
Give you a hint...

33:33.221 --> 33:34.597
His name may be Moose,

33:34.806 --> 33:36.516
but I'd describe
a certain appendage of his

33:36.724 --> 33:38.226
as horse-like.

33:45.233 --> 33:46.693
Don't panic,
I'm not stalking you.

33:47.902 --> 33:51.489
Archie, didn't we
have a deal?

33:53.616 --> 33:55.493
No, Geraldine,
we have a secret,

33:56.119 --> 33:58.204
Multiple secrets, actually.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.623
And maybe we could've
done something
to help Jason that morning,

34:00.832 --> 34:01.916
or maybe we couldn't have.

34:03.209 --> 34:04.669
And I won't tell
anyone anything,

34:04.877 --> 34:06.337
but you need to help me.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.756
This summer, the only thing
that kept me sane

34:08.965 --> 34:10.008
was writing these songs.

34:11.509 --> 34:13.636
So here's my
not-so-indecent proposal.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.097
I want to do
an independent study with you,

34:16.305 --> 34:18.266
as many mornings a week
as you can spare, and I swear

34:18.474 --> 34:19.767
that's all it'll be.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.021
And I won't tell anyone
about July Fourth, ever.

34:24.439 --> 34:25.064
Deal?

34:27.316 --> 34:32.363
Monday, Wednesday,
Friday, 7:30 a.m.,
before first period.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.240
I'll set it up

34:35.116 --> 34:36.409
and see about getting
you credit.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.880
<i>Good evening, friends.</i>

34:49.088 --> 34:50.590
<i>Are you all having
a good time?</i>

34:55.178 --> 34:57.597
<i>As honorary chairperson
and de facto queen</i>

34:57.805 --> 34:58.890
<i>of tonight's semiformal,</i>

34:59.098 --> 35:00.183
<i>it is my great pleasure</i>

35:00.391 --> 35:02.268
<i>to introduce this evening's
main entertainment.</i>

35:02.477 --> 35:05.104
<i>To know them
is to be obsessed with them.</i>

35:05.313 --> 35:07.273
<i>Though they usually perform
their own material,</i>

35:07.482 --> 35:08.775
<i>tonight, they're making
an exception</i>

35:08.983 --> 35:11.444
<i>and debuting a cover
of the song my parents claim
they were listening to</i>

35:11.652 --> 35:13.237
<i>the night Jason and I
were conceived.</i>

35:14.405 --> 35:15.656
<i>This one's for you, JJ.</i>

35:17.575 --> 35:19.368
- Sorry about that.
<i>- I give you
Josie and the Pussycats.</i>

35:29.670 --> 35:31.339
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.593
Did that go okay?

35:36.260 --> 35:39.097
Yeah, yes. I'll study
with Ms. Grundy
before school,

35:39.305 --> 35:40.932
football practice
after school,

35:41.140 --> 35:42.558
and work with my dad
on the weekends.

35:42.767 --> 35:43.726
It's going to be nuts.

35:43.893 --> 35:46.104
So long as you don't give up
your passion.

36:01.911 --> 36:02.954
Um...

36:03.579 --> 36:06.666
Now that I'm a River Vixen

36:06.874 --> 36:10.336
and you're gonna be
on varsity football,

36:10.503 --> 36:14.298
I have this fantasy of us
as a power couple...

36:15.550 --> 36:17.176
Or maybe even just
a couple.

36:18.177 --> 36:19.053
Betty...

36:20.513 --> 36:22.473
Is that so impossible
to imagine?

36:37.530 --> 36:40.116
Make sure those two
turtledoves
come to my after-party.

36:40.616 --> 36:41.617
Veronica too.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.953
I'm in the mood
for chaos.

36:50.001 --> 36:52.545
It's game time at
Chez Blossom, kiddies.

36:53.171 --> 36:54.922
We're going
old-school tonight.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.591
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

36:56.799 --> 36:59.177
Who wants to tryst
in the Closet of Love first?

36:59.385 --> 37:00.970
My vote is "A" for Archie.

37:02.513 --> 37:03.556
Anyone care to second it?

37:03.764 --> 37:06.517
- Wait, actually...
- Yes, Andrews! Yes.

37:06.726 --> 37:09.061
All right. Gather round, kids.

37:09.604 --> 37:11.898
Let's see who's riding
the ginger stallion tonight.

37:22.283 --> 37:25.328
Oh, no way!

37:25.536 --> 37:28.831
It's clearly pointing to...
The new girl.

37:29.040 --> 37:29.999
This should be fun.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.710
Um... I'm not doing this.

37:32.919 --> 37:34.003
That's up to you.

37:34.587 --> 37:36.005
But, if you don't,

37:36.214 --> 37:38.633
house rules decree
the hostess
gets to take your turn.

37:47.934 --> 37:50.895
I know her brother died
and everything,

37:51.103 --> 37:52.188
but...

37:52.396 --> 37:55.316
Cheryl Blossom
truly is the antichrist.

38:00.488 --> 38:03.199
So, uh, do you miss New York?

38:04.867 --> 38:06.619
It's been less than a week.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.622
But... Yes.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.293
Six minutes, twenty seconds.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.921
Okay. Your turn.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.423
Ask me a deep,
probing question

38:19.632 --> 38:21.092
to kill time.

38:23.636 --> 38:26.722
It looked like you and Betty
were having fun at the dance.

38:26.931 --> 38:29.809
Definitely. We've been
friends forever.

38:30.017 --> 38:32.061
- My turn.
- I didn't ask my question yet.

38:33.229 --> 38:35.314
Is that all it is?

38:35.523 --> 38:37.275
Just friends?

38:38.693 --> 38:40.486
We're not just friends,
we're best friends.

38:42.113 --> 38:46.200
My turn. Did you have
a boyfriend in New York?

38:48.035 --> 38:48.995
No.

38:49.662 --> 38:50.621
My turn.

38:51.247 --> 38:54.041
Could it ever possibly
become something more?

38:54.250 --> 38:56.127
Are you asking for Betty
or for yourself?

38:56.377 --> 39:00.214
For Betty, and you didn't
answer my question.

39:00.423 --> 39:03.092
I have never felt...
Whatever it is

39:03.301 --> 39:04.802
I'm supposed to feel

39:05.469 --> 39:06.387
with Betty.

39:06.971 --> 39:08.389
Have you felt it, though?

39:10.057 --> 39:11.392
With anyone?

39:11.600 --> 39:12.601
Yeah.

39:15.563 --> 39:16.731
This summer.

39:17.815 --> 39:20.693
- Have you?
- Maybe once.

39:25.031 --> 39:27.700
You're a little more dangerous
than you look, aren't you?

39:29.535 --> 39:31.329
All boy-next-door-ish?

39:33.581 --> 39:34.707
You have no idea.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.211
Your turn.

39:42.715 --> 39:46.052
Ask me a question, Archie.

39:50.264 --> 39:51.474
Ask me anything you want.

39:58.356 --> 39:59.732
We shouldn't do this.

40:00.524 --> 40:01.734
We definitely shouldn't
do this.

40:15.289 --> 40:16.665
Nailed it.

40:16.874 --> 40:17.875
Yes.

40:20.169 --> 40:21.253
Where's Betty?

40:21.754 --> 40:23.172
She spiraled and fled.

40:23.381 --> 40:25.674
Between us, she's a lot more
high-strung than she looks.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.510
You shady bitch.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.598
Crap. Betty's cell is off.

40:32.807 --> 40:33.974
- I'm getting an Uber.
- Can I come with you?

40:34.183 --> 40:35.309
We should probably
try to find her.

40:35.518 --> 40:36.977
Believe me.
The last thing
Betty wants

40:37.186 --> 40:38.813
is us tracking
her down together.

40:40.147 --> 40:41.315
We messed up.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.954
Hey, you're home early.
How was the dance?

40:56.664 --> 40:57.665
It was fine.

40:59.208 --> 41:00.543
I mean, it's not the Met Ball
or anything...

41:01.836 --> 41:03.462
Tell me about it.
You can cheer me up.

41:04.547 --> 41:05.881
I'm super tired, Mom.

41:11.637 --> 41:12.763
Is everything okay?

41:15.933 --> 41:17.518
Ronnie, what is it?

41:25.609 --> 41:28.946
<i>It was midnight,
when my old friend
Archie Andrews</i>

41:29.155 --> 41:31.866
<i>arrived at the one place
in town that was still open.</i>

41:32.450 --> 41:34.910
<i>He was looking
for the girl next door.</i>

41:37.204 --> 41:39.248
<i>Instead, he found me.</i>

41:42.501 --> 41:45.379
Hey, Pop. Betty hasn't come
in tonight, has she?

41:45.588 --> 41:49.008
Nope.
Just the night hawks
in tonight.

41:50.676 --> 41:51.552
Thanks.

41:59.268 --> 42:00.811
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?

42:01.520 --> 42:02.396
If you want.

42:05.232 --> 42:07.818
- What are you working on?
- My novel.

42:08.444 --> 42:10.946
It's about this summer,
and Jason Blossom.

42:11.155 --> 42:13.365
Seventeen years old
and how will he be remembered?

42:15.075 --> 42:16.744
As captain
of the water polo team?

42:16.952 --> 42:18.078
The Aquaholics?

42:18.996 --> 42:21.916
Considering how he died,
probably not.

42:22.124 --> 42:23.709
No, what I mean is...

42:26.086 --> 42:28.339
Was he doing everything
he was supposed to do,

42:28.881 --> 42:31.425
everything he wanted.
I mean, did he even know
what that was?

42:36.597 --> 42:38.432
Coach Clayton was in here
talking to Pop Tate.

42:39.099 --> 42:39.892
Varsity.

42:41.602 --> 42:44.563
Does that make you, what,
Mr. Popular Football God now?

42:45.314 --> 42:46.065
No.

42:48.609 --> 42:49.693
In fact, I'm kind of terrified

42:49.902 --> 42:51.195
I lost my
best friend tonight.

42:51.862 --> 42:52.863
If you mean Betty,

42:53.447 --> 42:55.824
whatever happened,
just talk to her.

42:56.033 --> 42:58.452
You know,
it'd go a long way.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.583
Would've gone a long way
with me.

43:35.906 --> 43:37.283
I'm not going to ask
what you did

43:37.491 --> 43:38.951
with Veronica at Cheryl's.

43:42.371 --> 43:44.331
But I'm asking you now,
right now,

43:44.540 --> 43:46.083
if you love me, Archie.

43:48.502 --> 43:50.087
Or even like me?

43:50.337 --> 43:52.214
Of course I love you, Betty.

43:55.426 --> 43:57.386
But I can't give you
the answer you want.

43:58.304 --> 43:59.471
Why?

44:03.350 --> 44:05.185
You are so perfect.

44:07.062 --> 44:08.981
I've never been
good enough for you.

44:10.858 --> 44:12.359
I'll never be
good enough for you.

44:31.754 --> 44:35.299
<i>And so,
it wasn't one heart
that broke that night.</i>

44:35.716 --> 44:36.925
<i>It was two.</i>

44:39.386 --> 44:41.513
<i>And the night was far
from over.</i>

44:46.852 --> 44:49.146
For the record, I'm not gay.

44:49.355 --> 44:52.024
Obviously not, Moose.
You're on the football team.

44:52.232 --> 44:54.568
But if you were gay,
what would you like to do?

44:55.611 --> 44:57.446
Everything but kiss.

44:57.655 --> 44:59.448
I love a good closet case.

44:59.657 --> 45:02.409
So, let's start with
skinny-dipping

45:03.118 --> 45:04.495
and then see what happens?

45:04.703 --> 45:07.623
Dude, are you okay?

45:24.348 --> 45:25.933
Oh, my God, it's Jason.

45:26.141 --> 45:27.643
He was shot.

45:29.395 --> 45:32.898
<i>By morning,
everyone would be
talking, texting,</i>

45:33.107 --> 45:34.733
<i>and posting about it.</i>

45:34.942 --> 45:36.443
<i>We'd all be feeling it.</i>

45:37.361 --> 45:41.448
<i>That the world around us
had changed,
maybe forever.</i>

45:42.616 --> 45:45.327
<i>That Riverdale wasn't
the same town
as before.</i>

45:46.203 --> 45:49.415
<i>That it was a town
of shadows and secrets now.</i>

45:49.998 --> 45:53.127
<i>On Monday,
the autopsy on Jason's body</i>

45:53.335 --> 45:54.795
<i>would take place.</i>

45:55.003 --> 45:58.424
<i>And on Tuesday,
halfway through fifth period,</i>

45:58.882 --> 46:01.176
<i>the first arrest
would be made.</i>
