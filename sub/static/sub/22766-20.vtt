WEBVTT

00:00.538 --> 00:03.507
The conjoint twins Dot and Lily Cronin

00:03.532 --> 00:08.170
spent an uneventful night in
our Pediatric Intensive Unit.

00:08.203 --> 00:09.889
They will be evaluated this morning,

00:09.914 --> 00:13.166
and if they remain stable,
the surgical team,

00:13.191 --> 00:17.024
under the supervision of Dr.
Frisch and Dr. Latham,

00:17.049 --> 00:19.442
will attempt to separate them.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.848
Lungs sound clear.

00:24.915 --> 00:27.064
The latest chest X-rays are good.

00:27.089 --> 00:28.256
No infiltrates.

00:28.830 --> 00:31.180
Vitals and saturation are stable.

00:32.076 --> 00:33.543
The girls are healthy.

00:33.568 --> 00:35.576
In my opinion, they're
strong enough for surgery.

00:35.601 --> 00:38.682
- Dr. Rhodes?
- I agree with Dr. Bekker.

00:38.707 --> 00:41.273
Actually, Dr. Rhodes will not
be in the operating room.

00:41.298 --> 00:42.911
Dr. Latham and I will be performing

00:42.936 --> 00:45.214
the cardiothoracic portion
of the separation.

00:45.239 --> 00:46.286
What?

00:46.311 --> 00:48.539
You've been so involved
since the beginning.

00:48.564 --> 00:50.364
What if we spoke to Dr. Frisch?

00:50.389 --> 00:52.393
Believe me, Dot and Lily have

00:52.418 --> 00:54.908
the finest surgeons in the hospital.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.032
We'll be back soon to take
the babies to the O.R.

01:00.449 --> 01:02.603
Excuse me.

01:03.477 --> 01:05.394
Connor...

01:05.420 --> 01:07.487
why aren't you on the team?

01:08.299 --> 01:09.899
He pulled himself out.

01:09.924 --> 01:11.519
Why?

01:12.172 --> 01:14.107
Because we lost a patient?

01:14.132 --> 01:16.646
I lost her and her baby,

01:16.671 --> 01:18.394
because of my poor judgment.

01:18.419 --> 01:20.483
I made the wrong call on her treatment.

01:20.508 --> 01:22.376
But the Cronins are counting on you.

01:22.410 --> 01:24.287
They're counting on the team.

01:25.415 --> 01:27.045
She's right.

01:31.438 --> 01:34.218
Look, I can understand if
you're having second thoughts.

01:34.467 --> 01:36.264
Yeah.

01:54.211 --> 01:55.678
- I'm worried about my sister.

01:55.703 --> 01:57.437
Why? She told you she
was going to Las Vegas.

01:57.471 --> 01:59.372
Yeah, but she's not returning
my calls or texts.

01:59.397 --> 02:01.567
She's ashamed she stole those drugs

02:01.592 --> 02:02.756
and lied about it.

02:02.781 --> 02:04.309
I still think we could've
handled it better.

02:04.334 --> 02:06.157
Handled it better? Emily
committed a crime.

02:06.182 --> 02:08.293
She's lucky she wasn't arrested.

02:08.533 --> 02:11.733
As soon as she wants something,
I'm sure you'll hear from her.

02:29.868 --> 02:32.913
- Morning.
- Good morning.

02:35.442 --> 02:38.711
- What?
- Dr. Halstead, incoming.

02:41.258 --> 02:42.825
- Hey, after work...
- Mm-hmm?

02:42.859 --> 02:44.512
You wanna meet me on the balcony?

02:44.573 --> 02:46.764
- Okay.
- All right.

02:48.699 --> 02:50.994
Monique, with us. Cesar?

02:51.019 --> 02:52.418
Bert Goodwin, 60-year-old male.

02:52.443 --> 02:54.001
Goodwin?

02:54.661 --> 02:56.115
Trauma One.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.947
Neighbors found him
unconscious in the garage.

02:57.972 --> 03:00.316
Motor running. Intubated in the field.

03:00.341 --> 03:01.823
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.802
Tachycardic at 120. BP, 145 over 95.

03:04.827 --> 03:06.725
EKG shows slight ST depressions.

03:06.750 --> 03:07.897
Sats at 92%.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.359
Okay, on my count, one, two, three.

03:10.766 --> 03:12.719
Monique, 12-lead EKG.

03:12.744 --> 03:14.550
We need a carboxyhemoglobin level.

03:14.788 --> 03:18.309
CBC, BMP, coags, lactate,
troponins, and a chest X-ray.

03:18.334 --> 03:20.130
- Got it.
- Maggie, call the ICU.

03:20.155 --> 03:21.867
Have them set up a hyperbaric chamber.

03:21.892 --> 03:23.326
Copy.

03:23.351 --> 03:25.414
And page Ms. Goodwin. Let her know.

03:25.663 --> 03:28.014
- Is this her husband?
- Ex-husband.

03:32.707 --> 03:34.337
How's the position of the twins?

03:34.362 --> 03:35.943
Good for peds surgery.

03:36.124 --> 03:38.731
- CT?
- Bit of a shadow in my field.

03:38.756 --> 03:40.694
Can we adjust the light?

03:43.055 --> 03:44.328
Good.

03:44.476 --> 03:45.725
Has everyone got room to work?

03:45.750 --> 03:47.948
No, bypass is in my way.

03:47.973 --> 03:49.997
What if you move the machine
to the foot of the bed?

03:50.022 --> 03:52.082
You could run the
tubing along the sides.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.977
That way, you won't
cross with anesthesia.

03:54.002 --> 03:56.307
Ah. Good idea.

03:57.609 --> 04:00.838
Tell me again why you're not in there.

04:04.182 --> 04:05.903
So, are we good to go?

04:06.664 --> 04:08.232
All right, it's show time.

04:16.007 --> 04:17.615
The pressure in the chamber

04:17.640 --> 04:20.175
unbinds carbon monoxide
from hemoglobin.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.562
It allows oxygen to bind.

04:21.587 --> 04:24.249
Now, we've already seen a
significant improvement.

04:24.274 --> 04:26.601
Bert's carbon monoxide levels

04:26.626 --> 04:29.261
are down from 55% to 15.

04:29.475 --> 04:32.010
Now, at 10%, we can take
him out of the chamber

04:32.035 --> 04:33.785
and lighten the sedation.

04:38.524 --> 04:41.826
He could've pulled into the
garage and fallen asleep.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.331
Maybe he had a mild stroke.

04:46.365 --> 04:47.899
We'll test for that.

04:47.924 --> 04:51.347
His girlfriend died, Dr. Halstead.

04:51.648 --> 04:53.672
He tried to kill himself.

04:57.811 --> 04:59.604
Dr. Choi, that homeless girl

04:59.629 --> 05:00.974
that you treated a couple months ago,

05:00.999 --> 05:03.201
she's back with her friend.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.698
They're asking for you.

05:04.742 --> 05:05.815
Hey, Nat...

05:05.840 --> 05:07.804
- Yeah?
- You free?

05:08.331 --> 05:11.167
Kiki, Deb, you remember Dr. Manning.

05:11.192 --> 05:12.399
- Hi.
- What's going on?

05:12.424 --> 05:13.943
Oh, she's really sick.

05:13.968 --> 05:15.316
BP's 102 over 68.

05:15.341 --> 05:17.655
Heart rate, 112. Temp, 100.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.485
My stomach hurts. Headaches.

05:19.510 --> 05:21.214
You are running a fever,
so let's take a look

05:21.239 --> 05:23.128
and see what's going on, all right?

05:24.428 --> 05:27.489
Hey, Deb, you're looking a
little under the weather too.

05:27.514 --> 05:28.948
I'm just tired.

05:28.973 --> 05:30.407
Still living on the streets?

05:30.432 --> 05:32.844
It's okay. Not so cold.

05:33.775 --> 05:35.957
Her liver is slightly enlarged.

05:35.992 --> 05:37.675
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Okay.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.938
We can help you with the nausea.

05:40.963 --> 05:42.407
4 milligrams of Zofran.

05:42.432 --> 05:43.684
We'll run some tests.

05:43.709 --> 05:46.641
Let's get a CBC, BMP,
LFT, hepatitis panel.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.814
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:48.839 --> 05:51.367
Ah. Let's get Deb into a room,

05:51.392 --> 05:52.368
take a look at her.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.761
Okay. Come on, I got ya.

05:54.811 --> 05:56.828
Better run the same labs for Deb too.

05:56.853 --> 05:58.521
Yeah.

06:01.242 --> 06:03.843
Mr. Goodwin, do you remember me?

06:03.878 --> 06:05.712
I'm Dr. Halstead.

06:07.148 --> 06:08.781
- Mr. Goodwin...
- I remember.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.356
Good.

06:10.985 --> 06:13.186
Can you follow my finger?

06:14.732 --> 06:16.132
Okay. How 'bout this?

06:16.157 --> 06:18.769
Can you touch your right
forefinger to your nose?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.024
Mr. Goodwin, can you try to touch

06:23.049 --> 06:25.091
your right forefinger
to your nose or...

06:25.806 --> 06:27.940
Why didn't you just let me die?

06:38.571 --> 06:40.205
We're gonna get you through this.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.472
I'll be back to check on you soon.

06:49.024 --> 06:50.891
I think he'll be okay.

06:56.743 --> 06:58.596
Damn, Bert.

06:58.621 --> 07:00.572
How could you do this?

07:04.205 --> 07:06.973
Can't you think of anyone
else but yourself?

07:06.998 --> 07:09.151
Sharon, come on.

07:09.176 --> 07:10.779
It... it's selfish and pathetic.

07:10.804 --> 07:12.614
Not helping right now.

07:12.898 --> 07:15.681
Attempted suicide is an
automatic five-day psych hold.

07:15.706 --> 07:16.804
Fine.

07:19.718 --> 07:21.865
Sharon, do you have a minute?

07:21.890 --> 07:23.315
The board wants to meet with you.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.922
Wha... what is it?
More complaining about

07:24.947 --> 07:26.312
the money we're spending?

07:26.337 --> 07:27.609
- I have to go.
- Sharon...

07:27.634 --> 07:29.822
Look, I... I have a
situation to deal with.

07:29.847 --> 07:32.234
Tell them I'll get back to them.

07:34.862 --> 07:36.803
This facility, Holly Oaks,

07:36.828 --> 07:39.930
has a good staff-to-resident ratio.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.313
They also have a nice package
of supplemental services:

07:42.338 --> 07:44.539
art, music, pet therapy.

07:44.658 --> 07:46.584
It's still a nursing home.

07:46.609 --> 07:48.708
It's a cardiac rehab facility.

07:49.196 --> 07:51.231
Why can't I go back to my apartment?

07:51.256 --> 07:54.052
No. You just got a new heart.

07:54.077 --> 07:56.029
You have to be monitored very closely,

07:56.054 --> 07:58.070
particularly for the
first three months.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.928
I don't deserve you.

08:02.354 --> 08:05.417
Can we just focus on finding
you a place to live?

08:05.442 --> 08:06.959
You're about to be discharged.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.940
But it's true, Sarah...

08:08.965 --> 08:11.099
I don't deserve you.

08:11.372 --> 08:14.259
Dr. Haywood, time to get
you in the cardiac chair.

08:14.284 --> 08:15.823
- Can't it wait?
- No.

08:15.848 --> 08:18.249
No, you have to change
position to prevent pneumonia.

08:18.314 --> 08:20.115
Find a place you like.

08:25.149 --> 08:27.150
We have a public health issue.

08:27.175 --> 08:28.433
Liver panels came back.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.574
Both Kiki and Deb tested
positive for Hep A.

08:30.599 --> 08:31.821
Oh, no.

08:31.846 --> 08:33.548
We need to admit them to the PICU.

08:33.573 --> 08:34.840
Yeah, but then what?

08:34.865 --> 08:36.472
It'll only be for a couple days.

08:36.496 --> 08:37.986
Then they'll wanna go
back out on the streets,

08:38.011 --> 08:39.446
and they'll be...
They'll be contagious.

08:39.471 --> 08:41.938
- Highly contagious.
- We have to report this.

08:41.964 --> 08:45.199
I... I understand they live
in some kind of encampment?

08:45.224 --> 08:47.888
Yeah, with a bunch of other
kids in close quarters.

08:47.913 --> 08:49.282
It's got to be cleared out.

08:49.307 --> 08:51.436
DCFS will have to find
homes for these kids.

08:51.460 --> 08:53.911
Meanwhile, let's get a team over there

08:53.936 --> 08:55.566
to see who else is infected,

08:55.591 --> 08:59.090
and immunize everybody
who's been exposed.

08:59.115 --> 09:00.663
Natalie and I should go.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.332
We've treated them. They
know us, April too.

09:03.357 --> 09:05.842
Okay, I'll stay and look
after Kiki and Deb.

09:05.867 --> 09:07.723
All right.

09:13.883 --> 09:16.170
Please, can we have
just one more minute?

09:16.195 --> 09:17.914
Yeah. Guys, hold on.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.755
We love you so much.

09:36.603 --> 09:38.921
Are we doing the right
thing taking this risk?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.480
Yes.

09:40.722 --> 09:44.132
Look after them, Dr. Rhodes.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.429
Don't let my babies die.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.234
- Thomas.
- Hey, Dr. Choi.

09:58.259 --> 09:59.892
Hey.

10:00.176 --> 10:02.244
You know April. Not sure if you met Dr.
Manning,

10:02.278 --> 10:04.279
but she was here with
me a couple months ago.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.039
Thomas, we need to examine everybody,

10:06.064 --> 10:08.505
but first we need to see
anyone who's not feeling well.

10:08.530 --> 10:10.144
The most sick first.

10:10.169 --> 10:12.045
- Laura.
- Laura?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.203
Is she the one who had the baby?

10:13.228 --> 10:15.296
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

10:17.188 --> 10:18.820
Laura?

10:19.043 --> 10:21.140
Dr. Manning?

10:21.345 --> 10:23.571
Have you seen my baby?

10:23.596 --> 10:26.197
No, but I know she was
adopted by a good family.

10:26.231 --> 10:27.832
Temp's 101.

10:27.857 --> 10:30.874
When was the last time you had
anything to eat or drink?

10:33.136 --> 10:35.404
Significantly jaundiced and dehydrated.

10:35.438 --> 10:36.582
Liver's enlarged.

10:36.607 --> 10:38.069
We need to get her to the hospital.

10:38.094 --> 10:40.423
- No.
- Laura, you have to.

10:40.448 --> 10:42.267
You have hepatitis. You could die.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.031
Call an ambulance.

10:45.056 --> 10:47.029
Thomas, who else is sick?

10:47.054 --> 10:48.679
Over here.

10:52.579 --> 10:54.294
Excuse me.

10:54.319 --> 10:56.220
Hey, I'm Dr. Choi.

10:56.602 --> 10:58.199
Hey.

11:00.239 --> 11:02.800
- Emily...
- Ethan?

11:02.825 --> 11:04.227
Emily, what are you doing here?

11:04.252 --> 11:07.265
Nowhere to go.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.986
It's all right, okay?

11:09.011 --> 11:10.331
I messed up.

11:10.654 --> 11:12.401
Have you been able to
eat or drink anything?

11:12.426 --> 11:15.369
No, it makes me throw up.

11:15.394 --> 11:17.425
Don't worry, you're gonna be okay.

11:17.450 --> 11:19.562
I'm gonna take care of you.

11:19.587 --> 11:21.294
Ambulances are on their way.

11:21.319 --> 11:24.223
Oh, my God.

11:26.928 --> 11:29.496
Take it easy, Em, I got you.

11:32.515 --> 11:33.745
What's up, Jay?

11:33.885 --> 11:36.566
Gunshot victim... just
waiting to get a statement.

11:37.236 --> 11:38.969
What'd Natalie say?

11:39.149 --> 11:40.571
I'll tell you tonight.

11:40.596 --> 11:42.969
You didn't ask her yet?
You've had Mom's ring a week.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.662
It's gotta be perfect.

11:44.817 --> 11:47.089
Do you have any idea what
real French champagne costs?

11:47.114 --> 11:48.470
More than you can afford.

11:48.495 --> 11:49.877
Don't I know it.

11:49.902 --> 11:51.481
Hello?

11:51.752 --> 11:53.357
Yes, he's right here.

11:53.382 --> 11:55.617
Dr. Charles, it's for you.

11:57.381 --> 11:58.848
Dr. Charles?

11:58.873 --> 12:00.927
Yes, this is Mr. and Mrs. Coveny.

12:00.952 --> 12:02.948
Uh, Detective Miller in Madison,

12:02.973 --> 12:04.641
uh, he said that you called him,

12:04.666 --> 12:06.549
that you're interested in
the case of our daughter,

12:06.574 --> 12:07.592
Olivia.

12:07.617 --> 12:09.321
She disappeared ten years ago.

12:09.346 --> 12:10.914
Mr. Coveny, um...

12:10.939 --> 12:13.925
- Why did you call?
- Well, I'm a, um...

12:14.307 --> 12:16.942
I'm a... I'm a forensic psychiatrist

12:16.967 --> 12:18.555
here in Chicago,

12:18.580 --> 12:21.090
and I'm interested in
your daughter's case

12:21.254 --> 12:23.106
purely in a clinical point of view.

12:23.131 --> 12:25.733
Come visit us. We'll
tell you about Olivia.

12:25.758 --> 12:27.559
She was really remarkable.

12:27.584 --> 12:29.957
Dr. Charles, if you find out something,

12:29.982 --> 12:31.038
call us, please.

12:31.063 --> 12:33.202
Uh, of course.

12:33.227 --> 12:35.008
Let me give you my number.

12:39.970 --> 12:41.674
Clamps are on.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.196
A lot of bigwigs here:

12:44.221 --> 12:46.988
Hopkins, Mayo, Duke.

12:47.013 --> 12:48.490
Dot's inferior vena cava

12:48.515 --> 12:50.497
is more anterior lateral
than anticipated.

12:50.659 --> 12:53.260
We'll have to reconstruct the
atrium to get it closed.

12:53.285 --> 12:54.769
What does that mean?

12:54.794 --> 12:57.078
They need to continue
the surgery on bypass.

12:57.103 --> 12:59.067
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to put the twins on bypass.

12:59.092 --> 13:00.768
You were right.

13:13.651 --> 13:15.486
Thanks, Kelly.

13:18.859 --> 13:20.654
Hey, Bert.

13:22.396 --> 13:24.664
You mind if I sit?

13:30.582 --> 13:32.717
Just for the record, I'm not
here on official business.

13:32.742 --> 13:34.610
I just...

13:36.376 --> 13:38.488
Came to say hi to an old pal.

13:39.747 --> 13:42.525
Leave me alone, Daniel.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.464
The other day, I heard
these two residents

13:52.489 --> 13:55.064
talking about this
ten-day master cleanse.

13:55.089 --> 13:56.683
You ever heard of that?

13:59.127 --> 14:00.426
Reminded me of the time
that you and I went on

14:00.451 --> 14:02.155
that grapefruit diet.

14:02.661 --> 14:05.078
You know, something about
the enzymes in the grape...

14:05.103 --> 14:07.293
Please...

14:08.433 --> 14:10.557
You're wasting your time.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.921
Just go away.

14:17.931 --> 14:19.332
Your fever's gone down.

14:19.357 --> 14:21.330
Heart rate and blood
pressure have improved.

14:21.355 --> 14:23.267
All good signs.

14:23.292 --> 14:25.088
Uh, what about Kiki?

14:25.113 --> 14:26.853
She's doing better too.

14:27.196 --> 14:29.796
Maggie, if Deb and
Kiki are both stable,

14:29.821 --> 14:31.422
we can send them up to the PICU.

14:31.447 --> 14:33.113
We got more coming in.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.040
Dr. Manning?

14:35.274 --> 14:36.524
You're going to Treatment Two.

14:36.549 --> 14:38.943
16-year-old female, suspect Hep A.

14:38.968 --> 14:40.624
Febrile and hypotensive.

14:40.657 --> 14:42.085
My stomach hurts.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.365
We're gonna help you
with that, all right?

14:43.390 --> 14:45.324
Emily?

14:45.349 --> 14:46.745
Possibly Hep A also.

14:46.770 --> 14:47.556
You're going to Treatment Four.

14:47.581 --> 14:48.807
Febrile and tachycardic.
Call Radiology.

14:48.832 --> 14:51.276
We need an ultrasound of her
liver, right upper quadrant.

14:51.301 --> 14:52.377
Got it.

14:52.402 --> 14:54.220
Transfer her on my count.

14:54.865 --> 14:56.661
- Ready?
- Yep.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.220
One, two, three.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.501
Let's get a CBC, BMP, LFTs,

15:03.526 --> 15:05.967
hepatitis panel, and a chest X-ray.

15:06.788 --> 15:08.261
Got it.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.547
She hates me.

15:13.572 --> 15:15.433
She doesn't hate you.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.490
I don't blame her.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.736
Just get some rest.

15:22.694 --> 15:24.544
I'm not going anywhere.

15:33.875 --> 15:35.953
Laura is emaciated, lethargic,

15:35.978 --> 15:38.016
and profoundly jaundiced.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.423
Incubation time should be similar,

15:39.448 --> 15:42.419
but she's presenting so
much worse than the others.

15:42.804 --> 15:44.602
I know you delivered this girl's baby.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.570
I'm sorry, Natalie.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.789
Both hearts on bypass.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.116
We're ready to go.

15:55.269 --> 15:57.406
One more echo to confirm positioning.

15:58.299 --> 16:00.234
I'm seeing a pretty large
muscular ventricular

16:00.259 --> 16:02.990
septal defect in Dot's heart.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.079
Why didn't we see this
on previous imaging?

16:07.104 --> 16:08.133
Doesn't matter.

16:08.158 --> 16:10.452
We'll have to correct it
before we can proceed.

16:10.641 --> 16:12.646
Is this a big problem?

16:13.272 --> 16:15.448
Patching a hole of unknown
size near the heart's apex,

16:15.473 --> 16:17.279
a difficult spot to reach,

16:17.304 --> 16:19.948
yeah, it's a very big problem.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.744
To get access, we need to
make a ventriculotomy.

16:22.769 --> 16:24.957
No, in this case, with
the abnormal anatomy

16:24.982 --> 16:26.550
of the heart, by cutting
into the ventricle,

16:26.575 --> 16:29.248
we can disrupt the heart's
conducting system.

16:29.273 --> 16:31.305
The heart might never beat again.

16:31.581 --> 16:33.618
We lose one girl, we lose them both.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.126
Excuse me.

16:37.214 --> 16:39.432
I think we should patch the
hole using the sandwich method:

16:39.457 --> 16:40.940
two pieces of Gore-Tex on either side.

16:40.965 --> 16:42.783
More incisions in her
tiny, fragile heart.

16:42.808 --> 16:44.773
No, too risky.

16:44.799 --> 16:47.193
Use a transcatheter VSD closure device.

16:47.218 --> 16:48.611
That's a cath lab procedure.

16:48.636 --> 16:50.655
We never do it on an open heart case.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.342
It's the only way to reach the VSD

16:52.367 --> 16:54.182
and not damage Dot's heart.

16:54.207 --> 16:55.338
No incision.

16:55.363 --> 16:57.075
We snake the patch in
through the atrium.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.637
- Dr. Latham...
- No, he's right.

16:58.662 --> 17:00.358
It's our only option.

17:00.727 --> 17:03.040
I will take full responsibility
for the outcome.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.119
Indeed you will.

17:04.145 --> 17:06.367
Dr. Rhodes will perform the procedure.

17:06.393 --> 17:07.675
Go scrub in.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.295
Yes, sir.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.721
- Connor...
- I have to do this.

17:15.746 --> 17:17.431
You realize if those
babies don't pull through,

17:17.455 --> 17:18.723
your career is over?

17:18.748 --> 17:22.268
Yeah. I do.

17:30.934 --> 17:32.168
- Sharon?
- Hm?

17:32.193 --> 17:33.494
Can I just talk to you for a second?

17:33.519 --> 17:34.486
Yeah.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.393
So...

17:37.598 --> 17:39.987
Bert isn't talking to Dr. Chapman,

17:40.012 --> 17:41.903
he isn't talking to Dr. Reese,

17:41.928 --> 17:43.668
not even talking to me.

17:44.158 --> 17:46.457
You two were married for 30 years.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.960
30 years.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.918
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just...
Please, I'm asking you,

17:49.943 --> 17:52.454
could you... Could you talk to him?

17:52.479 --> 17:54.188
Just try and open him up.

17:54.213 --> 17:56.314
So, you think that

17:56.339 --> 17:58.013
because of all those good years,

17:58.038 --> 17:59.640
I owe him something now?

17:59.665 --> 18:02.242
I'm just saying that, coming from you,

18:02.267 --> 18:03.935
it might make a difference, that's all.

18:03.984 --> 18:06.161
Well, let me ask you this, Daniel,

18:06.554 --> 18:08.945
what did Bert owe me
when he walked out?

18:22.445 --> 18:24.337
You suspected a comorbid illness.

18:24.362 --> 18:25.771
You were right.

18:28.387 --> 18:30.074
Laura?

18:30.528 --> 18:34.161
Your HIV antibody tests
came back as negative.

18:34.186 --> 18:35.794
However, you did test positive

18:35.819 --> 18:39.047
for both hepatitis A and hepatitis C.

18:39.072 --> 18:40.649
I am very sorry.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.020
Hep A is recent,

18:44.045 --> 18:47.203
but the Hep C, we think
you've had for a long time.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.817
It's damaged your
kidneys and your liver.

18:51.529 --> 18:53.236
My baby...

18:53.503 --> 18:55.070
did I give it to her?

18:55.095 --> 18:56.396
We don't know.

18:56.543 --> 18:58.049
We'll have to contact her parents

18:58.074 --> 18:59.324
and have them bring her in,

18:59.349 --> 19:00.857
so that we can test her as well.

19:02.822 --> 19:03.963
My little girl.

19:03.988 --> 19:06.407
Now, luckily, if she is infected,

19:06.432 --> 19:08.400
at this early stage, we can treat her.

19:09.069 --> 19:10.823
When she comes,

19:10.848 --> 19:12.835
can I see her?

19:15.586 --> 19:17.086
We'll see if that's possible.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.193
Have you decided on a rehab facility?

19:41.274 --> 19:43.409
Oh, you pick one.

19:43.434 --> 19:45.217
I'm not gonna be living there, you are.

19:45.242 --> 19:48.445
Sarah, I'm sure you'll
find the best one,

19:48.470 --> 19:51.827
or at least the lesser
of all the evils.

19:52.531 --> 19:54.298
You know...

19:54.323 --> 19:58.026
I suddenly love choral music...

19:59.404 --> 20:01.972
Just like my heart donor.

20:06.058 --> 20:07.976
It's good to see you.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.248
The nurses aren't very good company.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.519
I hardly ever see them.

20:13.801 --> 20:15.404
What do you mean? They're
supposed to be walking you.

20:15.429 --> 20:17.367
- Haven't you been outside today?
- Nope.

20:17.392 --> 20:19.496
Nurses put me in this
chair and left me.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.027
I imagine she's very busy.

20:25.205 --> 20:26.826
Hey, uh, this transplant patient's

20:26.851 --> 20:28.659
supposed to walk every three hours.

20:28.684 --> 20:30.845
We are short-staffed today.

20:30.870 --> 20:32.759
I'll get to it when I can.

20:32.836 --> 20:35.103
Never mind, I'll do it.

20:35.844 --> 20:38.438
Come on, Dad, we're
gonna go for a walk.

20:38.510 --> 20:41.542
Oh, I'd like that.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.616
So far, we have five Hep A patients:

20:53.641 --> 20:55.842
one adult and four adolescents.

20:55.867 --> 20:58.288
One of the patients
also has hepatitis C.

20:58.485 --> 21:00.468
She gave birth to a
baby a few months back,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.810
- put her up for adoption.
- Hm.

21:02.897 --> 21:05.639
The adoptive parents are
here to get the baby tested.

21:05.780 --> 21:08.805
Please keep me informed
if those numbers change.

21:08.830 --> 21:10.985
Oh, and another thing,
Peter Kalmick called.

21:11.171 --> 21:12.871
They're asking for you
upstairs in the board room.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.280
Yeah, I know. I... I'll get to them.

21:15.305 --> 21:18.039
Oh, and have you been up to see Bert?

21:18.228 --> 21:19.842
No.

21:32.878 --> 21:34.379
I can't see her field of positioning

21:34.413 --> 21:35.485
as much as I had hoped.

21:35.510 --> 21:37.266
Can you get the device in place?

21:37.910 --> 21:39.710
Give me a second.

21:43.255 --> 21:44.722
Okay.

21:44.757 --> 21:47.058
Snaking the catheter into position.

21:48.528 --> 21:50.926
Pulling the first half of the
patch into the left ventricle.

21:50.951 --> 21:52.730
But if you can't see
or feel the alignment,

21:52.755 --> 21:54.469
you can't be sure of deploying
the second half correctly.

21:54.494 --> 21:56.478
So we'll have to open
the heart even more

21:56.503 --> 21:57.691
to make the repair, which is exactly

21:57.715 --> 21:59.833
- what we're trying to avoid.
- Maybe not.

21:59.859 --> 22:01.544
Let's try a flexible pharyngoscope.

22:01.569 --> 22:02.922
Maybe we can see where
the patch is lying

22:02.947 --> 22:05.005
before we deploy. Beth?

22:05.030 --> 22:06.598
Here.

22:16.855 --> 22:18.493
Dr. Rhodes...

22:21.491 --> 22:23.173
Well?

22:23.198 --> 22:25.062
Uh...

22:25.690 --> 22:27.161
Yeah, I see it.

22:27.186 --> 22:29.346
All right, aligning the patch.

22:29.761 --> 22:32.377
And deploying.

22:32.844 --> 22:35.291
The VSD's repaired.

22:35.592 --> 22:37.611
Now we can proceed.

22:45.111 --> 22:46.768
I got some fluids in you.

22:46.793 --> 22:48.796
Should be feeling better.

22:49.382 --> 22:51.684
Heart rate and blood
pressure look good.

22:54.147 --> 22:56.750
Em, I, uh... I...

22:56.904 --> 22:58.972
I'm just...

22:58.997 --> 23:00.707
I'm so sorry...

23:01.602 --> 23:03.370
for what I did.

23:04.012 --> 23:05.879
I lied to you.

23:07.563 --> 23:09.673
I'm so sorry.

23:11.612 --> 23:13.686
Don't worry about that.

23:13.711 --> 23:16.768
Hey, I'll be right back, okay?

23:24.037 --> 23:26.706
- We can send Emily upstairs.
- Good.

23:27.022 --> 23:29.649
And when she gets well, you
should talk to Dr. Charles.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.041
We'll see.

23:31.066 --> 23:33.089
He knows places, group homes
that could take her in.

23:33.114 --> 23:34.701
So, you want me to send her away?

23:34.726 --> 23:36.760
She needs professional help.

23:36.799 --> 23:38.714
Let her be somebody else's problem?

23:38.739 --> 23:39.934
Ethan...

23:39.959 --> 23:41.901
That's how I've always
dealt with Emily.

23:41.926 --> 23:43.552
I can't do that anymore.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.204
Oh, Dr. Charles.

23:49.858 --> 23:51.567
- Hello.
- Bob.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.218
And Dr. Reese.

23:53.243 --> 23:56.312
Sarah was taking me for a walk.

24:01.115 --> 24:03.584
As soon as I get him back,
I'll finish rounds.

24:05.722 --> 24:08.858
Dr. Charles, why don't you
see me the rest of the way?

24:08.883 --> 24:11.826
Let Sarah get back to her real job.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.619
Uh... sure.

24:18.135 --> 24:19.936
Thank you, Dr. Reese.

24:20.236 --> 24:22.844
You know, Sarah told me

24:22.869 --> 24:25.129
that a woman in her support group

24:25.154 --> 24:28.423
says her husband came away
from his heart transplant

24:28.448 --> 24:31.155
- a changed man.
- Really?

24:31.180 --> 24:33.155
Yeah, I did a little Googling.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.985
It turns out that there's a
lot of anecdotal evidence

24:36.010 --> 24:38.096
that transplant patients experience

24:38.126 --> 24:41.037
profound personality changes.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.016
Yes, uh, "anecdotal" being
the key word there.

24:44.041 --> 24:46.509
Oh, no, actually there's a...
A name for it.

24:46.534 --> 24:50.363
It's called cell memory phenomenon:

24:50.625 --> 24:53.342
the theory that memory is stored

24:53.367 --> 24:56.807
in the neurons of donated organs.

24:56.832 --> 24:58.833
I mean, it would certainly explain

24:58.858 --> 25:02.251
why recipients develop the tastes

25:02.276 --> 25:04.946
and preferences and habits,

25:04.971 --> 25:08.937
even dreams of their heart's donors.

25:09.999 --> 25:11.633
What are you doing, Bob?

25:11.658 --> 25:13.597
Your antisocial personality disorder

25:13.622 --> 25:16.007
isn't gonna be affected
by a transplant.

25:16.032 --> 25:18.617
The issue is your
brain, not your heart.

25:20.446 --> 25:23.100
Glenda, could you escort Dr.
Haywood back to his room?

25:23.235 --> 25:25.086
He has had a nice, long walk.

25:25.111 --> 25:28.053
- Sure.
- Yeah.

25:28.193 --> 25:31.727
Well, Sarah seems open
to the possibility,

25:31.752 --> 25:35.580
or do you think she's just
another young, gullible woman,

25:35.605 --> 25:37.372
Daniel?

25:57.796 --> 26:00.549
Uh, yes, hi, uh, Mr. Coveny?

26:00.574 --> 26:04.202
It's, uh, it's Dr. Charles
from Chicago Med.

26:06.591 --> 26:08.257
I so appreciate your invitation

26:08.291 --> 26:09.516
to come up and visit.

26:09.541 --> 26:11.583
It's very helpful for
my research to get a...

26:11.608 --> 26:14.281
A complete picture of
everyone involved.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.799
Seems like the world's
forgotten about Olivia.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.295
We're just so grateful to
talk to someone who hasn't.

26:21.544 --> 26:23.473
Left her room just the way it was

26:23.498 --> 26:25.280
the day Olivia disappeared.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.219
That was taken the summer between

26:28.254 --> 26:30.450
her freshman and sophomore
year in college.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.925
She was a science major
at Madison, right?

26:33.959 --> 26:36.823
And she minored in astronomy?

26:37.127 --> 26:39.273
Did you get to know any
of her professors?

26:39.298 --> 26:42.133
No, she never mentioned
any of her professors.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.801
The police interviewed everyone.

26:43.836 --> 26:45.537
No one knew anything.

26:48.140 --> 26:51.229
Olivia loved monkeys.

26:56.693 --> 26:58.128
Where's the third one?

26:58.153 --> 27:00.680
Oh, yeah, when we picked her
things up from the dorm,

27:00.705 --> 27:03.316
it wasn't there; we don't
know what happened to it.

27:12.322 --> 27:14.135
Laura?

27:15.562 --> 27:18.264
I have some good news.
Your baby's okay.

27:18.298 --> 27:19.835
Look.

27:20.126 --> 27:21.757
My baby.

27:25.274 --> 27:26.753
What's her name?

27:26.990 --> 27:28.477
Anna.

27:30.101 --> 27:31.895
Anna.

27:34.538 --> 27:36.797
I promise we'll take good care of her.

27:45.121 --> 27:46.810
This way.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.207
- Thank you.
- Of course.

27:56.995 --> 27:58.607
So, the baby tested negative.

27:58.632 --> 28:00.633
Yeah, and Laura got to see her.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.517
- That's great.
- Yeah.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.574
- Good omen.
- What?

28:12.250 --> 28:13.734
- No pulse.
- I'll bag her.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.315
Milligram of epi.

28:19.068 --> 28:20.384
Come on.

28:22.098 --> 28:23.610
The girl with Hep C.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.148
Hold compressions.

28:26.923 --> 28:28.666
Another milligram of epi.

28:29.323 --> 28:30.607
Come on.

28:30.856 --> 28:32.411
Come on.

28:34.187 --> 28:36.226
Hold compressions.

28:37.779 --> 28:39.507
- Asystole.
- No.

28:39.532 --> 28:41.095
No.

28:41.813 --> 28:43.474
Laura, come on.

28:45.170 --> 28:47.196
She's gone.

28:54.381 --> 28:57.350
Time of death, 15:25.

29:03.899 --> 29:06.568
Have you been able to reach her family?

29:07.007 --> 29:08.574
Not yet.

29:38.729 --> 29:41.826
You know, the last time
you brought Lyla here...

29:45.453 --> 29:47.569
Just before...

29:47.862 --> 29:49.858
she passed away,

29:50.385 --> 29:52.953
as sick as she was, she
had the presence of mind

29:52.978 --> 29:56.352
to... ask me

29:56.562 --> 30:00.134
to look after you when she was gone.

30:03.506 --> 30:07.476
Sharon, I... I...

30:07.536 --> 30:10.227
I'm sorry for the...

30:10.625 --> 30:12.616
pain I caused you.

30:13.954 --> 30:18.032
You know, I don't need or want
an apology from you, Bert,

30:18.920 --> 30:22.275
but I'm not gonna sit here
and lie to you either.

30:23.251 --> 30:25.068
It was hard,

30:26.238 --> 30:28.642
the way you left me...

30:29.300 --> 30:30.900
our life.

30:32.455 --> 30:35.508
But what's done is done,
and I'm a big girl.

30:35.533 --> 30:37.236
I'm working it out.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.788
But we can be proud of this.

30:45.240 --> 30:48.094
We have raised

30:48.561 --> 30:51.600
three wonderful children.

30:55.797 --> 30:57.704
Don't do this to them, Bert.

31:00.399 --> 31:03.442
Don't you dare do this to them.

31:10.321 --> 31:13.349
And you let these people...

31:14.023 --> 31:15.727
help you.

31:29.386 --> 31:31.153
I just told you.

31:31.187 --> 31:33.379
I can't let you in The
without his permission.

31:33.404 --> 31:36.039
It's just that Dr. Haywood is
entering this rehab facility

31:36.074 --> 31:37.129
on very short notice,

31:37.154 --> 31:39.747
and it's just important that I
get him a few personal items:

31:39.772 --> 31:41.754
uh, you know, toothbrush, toothpaste...

31:41.779 --> 31:43.587
Have him call me.

32:18.925 --> 32:21.827
- Liver separation is complete.
- Both hearts as well.

32:21.852 --> 32:24.768
- Already off bypass.
- Decannulated as well.

32:24.957 --> 32:27.048
Pacing wires are in.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.539
Patch is holding.

32:30.577 --> 32:32.458
Both hearts look good.

32:42.988 --> 32:45.473
So, what's included in your
massive transfusion protocol?

32:45.498 --> 32:46.161
Well...

32:46.186 --> 32:48.944
And how responsive is the blood bank?

32:48.985 --> 32:50.566
They'll come in with a cooler

32:50.591 --> 32:53.238
stocked with 4 units
of reds and 2 plasma.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.511
Well, can I see the data

32:54.536 --> 32:56.125
and your process
improvement indicators?

32:56.150 --> 32:57.972
- Well...
- Excuse me.

32:57.997 --> 32:59.290
Can I help you?

32:59.315 --> 33:01.391
Ms. Goodwin, this is our new
division chief of trauma,

33:01.416 --> 33:02.549
James Lanik.

33:02.574 --> 33:03.874
Jimmy.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.716
New chief of trauma?

33:05.741 --> 33:07.390
Ms. Goodwin is our Executive Director

33:07.415 --> 33:09.750
of Patient and Medical Services.

33:09.784 --> 33:11.631
Looks like you weren't expecting me.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.157
News to me.

33:13.182 --> 33:14.476
I just got the memo.

33:14.501 --> 33:17.699
Well, it's nice to meet you, Dr. Lanik.

33:20.167 --> 33:22.358
Hospital intrigue.

33:22.383 --> 33:24.440
Yeah, you'll see.

33:25.037 --> 33:28.288
Sharon, congratulations on the twins.

33:28.313 --> 33:29.973
Come join us for champagne.

33:30.030 --> 33:31.781
How is it we have a new chief of trauma

33:31.806 --> 33:33.950
and I wasn't consulted?

33:33.975 --> 33:36.493
I've been trying to get you
to meet with us all day.

33:36.518 --> 33:38.301
But we should've given you a heads-up,

33:38.326 --> 33:39.384
and I'm sorry.

33:39.409 --> 33:40.695
The position needed to be filled,

33:40.720 --> 33:42.665
and I know Dr. Lanik personally.

33:42.690 --> 33:44.081
He is first-rate.

33:44.106 --> 33:46.234
Sharon, this is Gwen Garrett,

33:46.259 --> 33:48.013
our new C.O.O.

33:48.249 --> 33:51.434
New? We never had an old C.O.O.

33:51.459 --> 33:54.361
Well, it's a recently created position.

33:54.386 --> 33:57.036
Help run the hospital a
little more efficiently.

33:57.061 --> 33:59.629
Efficiently or economically?

33:59.910 --> 34:01.277
Uh, both.

34:01.302 --> 34:02.806
Ms. Garret's done a wonderful job

34:02.831 --> 34:05.686
minimizing red ink at several
large pharmaceuticals.

34:06.285 --> 34:08.452
I look forward to working with you, Ms.
Goodwin.

34:08.476 --> 34:10.444
As do I, Ms. Garrett.

34:25.261 --> 34:27.034
It's amazing.

34:37.614 --> 34:39.889
Excuse me, Dr. Rhodes, Ralph Ballard.

34:39.915 --> 34:41.616
Have you got a minute? Yeah.

34:44.692 --> 34:46.985
I gotta run to my locker.
I'll meet you on the balcony?

34:47.010 --> 34:49.212
Sure.

34:49.559 --> 34:52.654
Will, care to come celebrate with me?

34:52.842 --> 34:54.469
Uh, no thanks.

35:01.763 --> 35:04.468
- Natalie...
- It was her?

35:05.035 --> 35:06.529
Yes, but...

35:09.762 --> 35:11.667
Please.

35:30.161 --> 35:32.463
Told Emily when she gets
out, she can stay with us.

35:32.488 --> 35:34.083
Ethan, you can't trust her.

35:34.108 --> 35:36.025
Look... you know how
hard she's been trying,

35:36.050 --> 35:37.794
how... how great she was with patients.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.871
Yeah, until she quit without notice.

35:39.896 --> 35:42.431
Look, I... I... I know she said
some awful things to you and...

35:42.466 --> 35:44.569
- No, it's not about that.
- Then what is it?

35:44.835 --> 35:47.036
You're the one who always told
me how important family is.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.663
Yes, and I treated Emily like family.

35:49.688 --> 35:50.811
I stood up for her,

35:50.836 --> 35:52.375
I told you to give her another chance,

35:52.400 --> 35:55.234
and how did she thank you? Thank me?

35:55.654 --> 35:58.668
She stole drugs. She lied to us.

35:58.693 --> 36:00.843
Ethan, she's damaged.

36:00.868 --> 36:02.630
You can't fix her.

36:03.334 --> 36:05.037
I gotta try.

36:06.091 --> 36:09.358
She's just gonna bring
her mess into our lives.

36:10.597 --> 36:12.378
April...

36:12.794 --> 36:15.339
I'm sorry, but she's
coming home with us.

36:18.308 --> 36:20.558
No, Ethan...

36:20.583 --> 36:22.160
she's going home with you.

36:30.475 --> 36:32.108
Natalie!

36:33.075 --> 36:34.873
Hey...

36:35.714 --> 36:37.648
I wanted this to be so special:

36:37.673 --> 36:40.174
uh, a view of the city, champagne.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.884
Not like this, not in a parking lot,

36:41.909 --> 36:44.444
but... I'm not gonna let you go...

36:46.324 --> 36:47.758
Not without asking. Will-

36:47.783 --> 36:49.451
- Just wait.

36:53.778 --> 36:55.721
Will you marry me?

37:03.999 --> 37:07.092
Will you marry me?

37:25.459 --> 37:28.211
So, tell me, did you
orchestrate this whole thing?

37:28.236 --> 37:31.272
Reluctant hero comes
in and saves the day?

37:31.297 --> 37:34.137
You give me too much credit.

37:34.162 --> 37:35.257
Do I?

37:36.578 --> 37:40.031
Your ambition strikes me as boundless.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.703
Wait a second, do you
really think that?

37:42.728 --> 37:44.306
I don't know what to think.

37:44.473 --> 37:46.554
Yes, you helped keep
those babies alive,

37:46.579 --> 37:49.528
but I'm sure you also secured
yourself an attending position.

37:49.553 --> 37:53.393
Uh, God, Ava, I...

37:57.250 --> 37:59.051
What?

38:03.867 --> 38:05.716
You bastard.

38:06.641 --> 38:09.246
You got an offer tonight, didn't you?

38:09.637 --> 38:11.524
That guy in the PICU?

38:12.102 --> 38:13.711
Mayo Clinic.

38:16.102 --> 38:18.122
You got an offer at the Mayo Clinic?

38:18.147 --> 38:19.598
I can't believe it.

38:21.717 --> 38:24.474
And of course you're going to take it.

38:28.494 --> 38:30.419
Would you?

38:33.836 --> 38:36.471
Yes. Absolutely.

38:41.870 --> 38:43.253
Great.

39:15.546 --> 39:17.478
Oh, Dr. Charles.

39:17.727 --> 39:20.122
- Come to say good-bye.
- I did.

39:20.147 --> 39:23.015
You all set to, uh, head off to rehab?

39:23.268 --> 39:27.153
Well, actually, Sarah has
asked me to live with her

39:27.178 --> 39:29.313
while I complete my recovery.

39:29.338 --> 39:30.972
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

39:30.997 --> 39:33.665
Sarah's taking you home with her?

39:33.777 --> 39:35.912
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

39:36.034 --> 39:40.437
Well, I guess she certainly
turned out to be the, uh...

39:40.462 --> 39:42.830
The devoted daughter
you were looking for.

39:42.855 --> 39:45.390
I'm a very lucky man.

39:46.595 --> 39:48.362
So, guess what, I, uh...

39:48.387 --> 39:50.108
I decided I'm gonna head up to Madison

39:50.133 --> 39:52.420
and give that forensic
psychiatry seminar.

39:52.445 --> 39:54.513
- Oh, you decided to do it?
- Yeah.

39:54.538 --> 39:56.470
It turns out that they got a bit of

39:56.495 --> 39:58.997
a dark history up there at
the university, you know,

39:59.022 --> 40:01.393
some homegrown crime of their own.

40:01.418 --> 40:03.302
- Oh?
- Yeah, around ten years ago,

40:03.327 --> 40:06.207
I think around the time that
you were teaching there,

40:06.232 --> 40:10.698
the, um... the Olivia... Coveny case?

40:10.723 --> 40:12.190
You remember?

40:12.269 --> 40:15.071
No, doesn't ring a bell.

40:15.105 --> 40:17.976
Her parents are convinced
she was murdered.

40:18.748 --> 40:21.116
Murdered?

40:21.228 --> 40:23.666
Well, just because a girl is missing

40:23.691 --> 40:26.040
doesn't mean she was murdered.

40:28.264 --> 40:29.998
Oh, uh, so you do remember?

40:30.023 --> 40:31.791
Hm? What? Sorry?

40:31.912 --> 40:34.781
Well, I... I didn't say
that she was missing.

40:34.912 --> 40:37.613
Oh, well, guess I just assumed.

40:37.638 --> 40:38.850
Yeah, I was kinda surprised

40:38.875 --> 40:39.975
when you said you didn't remember,

40:40.000 --> 40:41.967
because she was a, um...

40:42.023 --> 40:44.600
She was an astronomy student, actually,

40:44.625 --> 40:46.326
one of yours.

40:46.351 --> 40:49.225
Ah, so, this is where this is going,

40:49.270 --> 40:51.739
this little dance of yours.

40:51.764 --> 40:54.521
You're suggesting I'm a murderer.
Really?

40:54.546 --> 40:56.040
You know what's the
most fascinating thing

40:56.065 --> 40:58.669
about serial killers? Even
the most brilliant ones,

40:58.694 --> 41:00.701
they all have this weakness,

41:00.726 --> 41:02.378
where they can't seem to resist taking

41:02.403 --> 41:05.183
a personal item from their victims,

41:05.208 --> 41:06.936
you know, like, uh... Like a trophy.

41:06.961 --> 41:08.018
Trophy?

41:08.043 --> 41:09.573
Yeah, in this case, I think it's a...

41:09.598 --> 41:12.446
- little stuffed monkey.
- Oh, please.

41:12.471 --> 41:15.297
Why don't you just admit you lost?

41:15.322 --> 41:17.515
I'm going home with my daughter,

41:17.540 --> 41:19.439
and you can't do anything about it.

41:21.891 --> 41:24.326
Give it up.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.501
You appreciate the irony, don't you?

41:26.526 --> 41:28.765
That you've got this new
heart, this new life,

41:28.790 --> 41:30.673
and you spend the rest of it in jail?

41:32.126 --> 41:33.806
Bob?

41:34.424 --> 41:36.246
Bob?

41:46.580 --> 41:48.594
Dad?
