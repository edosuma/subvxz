WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:04.270
Get out. They're expecting you.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.510
Cleaver, you're a lawyer.
You have a duty to justice.

00:07.560 --> 00:08.910
What do you say?

00:08.960 --> 00:10.910
What sort of fee are we talking?

00:10.960 --> 00:12.870
We're all on edge with
this Thompson thing but...

00:12.920 --> 00:15.390
Hey! I am in the frame here now.

00:15.440 --> 00:18.230
Assorted supporting vessels,
one poor bastard in a balloon.

00:18.280 --> 00:22.070
That'll be 1.2 million, thank you,
sir. Will that be cash or credit?

00:22.120 --> 00:25.430
And will you be splitting
the bill with Mr Greene?

00:25.480 --> 00:28.750
Oh, what the hell is that?!

00:28.800 --> 00:30.400
1978.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.040
"Merry Christmas to darling
Wendy, from Santa."

00:36.560 --> 00:39.190
- Are you holding?
- Holding?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.230
Um, how much are you doing?

00:41.280 --> 00:43.320
What do you want?

00:45.440 --> 00:48.310
How much jail time would
Edgar be prepared to spend?

00:48.360 --> 00:51.160
Would he be comfortable with, say, 10?

00:52.800 --> 00:55.270
- You know her?
- Uh, yep.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.030
She used to be Stein.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.480
Worked for us as a paralegal.

01:38.120 --> 01:41.750
I was asked to deliver
10 kilograms of cocaine

01:41.800 --> 01:44.590
to a certain address in Marrakesh.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.150
It was very specific.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.550
The cocaine was to be hidden in a vase.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.750
Hmm. Is the person who made
that request in this courtroom?

01:52.800 --> 01:53.870
He is.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.920
Would you please point out this
person to His Honour and the jury?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.590
Let the jury note she has
indicated Edgar Thompson.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.270
No, I haven't.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.390
It was Cleaver Greene.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.270
Oh, dear, dear poppet.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.830
He called me and said he and
his wife were in Marrakesh

02:12.880 --> 02:14.910
and wanted to make a big
score while they were...

02:14.960 --> 02:17.560
- Uh, Your Honour...
- Sit down.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.830
Your Honour, one is
both bemused and dismayed

02:22.880 --> 02:25.550
by these grave and
uncorroborated allegations.

02:25.600 --> 02:30.320
Especially allegations against
one's own most learned co-counsel.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.710
May I respectfully submit

02:34.760 --> 02:39.070
that Your Honour must consider
the delicacy of this situation,

02:39.120 --> 02:43.190
as the reputation of a highly
experienced member of this bar

02:43.240 --> 02:45.550
is in danger of being sullied.

02:45.600 --> 02:50.630
Mr Greene's reputation is
in danger? Oh, woe is me.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.870
Mr Greene.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.750
Uh, well, um,

02:56.800 --> 03:02.630
Your Honour is no doubt aware
of the extremely serious

03:02.680 --> 03:07.590
if utterly spurious conflict
of interest that this causes me.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.630
I am.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.950
The integrity of this entire
trial is at stake, Your Honour,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.510
and thus it behooves me at this juncture

03:17.560 --> 03:20.790
to undertake the most drastic action

03:20.840 --> 03:24.070
that any member of a
bar can ever undertake.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.230
I understand.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.400
Thank you, Your Honour.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.550
This is most unusual.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.830
Given the circumstances, you intend
to stay at the bar table, do you?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.670
Ah, indeed I do, Your Honour.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.750
There are no objections, Ms Huntley-Brown?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.550
No objections, Your Honour.

03:57.600 --> 03:58.590
Mr Crown?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.030
No, Your Honour. Happy to proceed.

04:00.080 --> 04:03.390
Well, let's get on with it, then.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.390
There is someone in this court

04:05.440 --> 04:08.540
who may be able to
provide some assistance.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.670
Cleaver came home one night
and told me that Ed...

04:12.720 --> 04:16.320
.. that Mr Thompson had
given us a trip to Morocco.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.709
- And you didn't ask any questions?
- Why would I?

04:18.760 --> 04:21.390
You had unwavering trust
in your then-husband?

04:21.440 --> 04:22.470
Yes.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.470
May I remind you you are under oath.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.070
I understand.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.350
What was the reason for the
breakdown of your marriage?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.630
There was no single reason.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.830
As I suspected. He cheated on you!

04:33.880 --> 04:38.510
Didn't he? He cheated! He
lied to you, repeatedly.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.150
So let me ask you this
-- did you trust him?

04:41.200 --> 04:42.830
We loved each other.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.030
We loved each other too.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.350
Members of the public
will listen in silence.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.440
Yeah, everybody loves Cleaver.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.030
Have you seen that show? It's so funny.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.150
Sheriff, please remove that
young lady from this court.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.590
- Oh! What?
- You have to leave, ma'am.

05:00.640 --> 05:05.030
Why? I pay my taxes. I
pay my fucking taxes!

05:05.080 --> 05:06.950
Please come quietly.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.590
Who do you think you are?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.630
Cleaver, what are they doing?

05:10.680 --> 05:13.270
Yes, you just go with the nice man.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.470
- Really?
- Really.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.120
(OK. I'll see you later then, OK?)

05:18.560 --> 05:20.590
Proceed, Mr Crown.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.110
I shall repeat the question.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.160
Did you trust your
ex-husband -- yes or no?

05:25.760 --> 05:26.950
Sometimes.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.190
Meaning, he was not and is
not entirely trustworthy.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.350
Oh, well, maybe not, but that
doesn't make him a drug dealer.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.340
A drug user, may...

05:35.920 --> 05:37.670
He is not a drug dealer.

05:37.720 --> 05:40.550
Your Honour, I must object in
the strongest possible terms.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.750
To what?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.470
Mr Crown is badgering the witness.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.430
No, he is not.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.070
No, Your Honour.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.990
However, I was married to
this witness, Your Honour.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.430
We have a child together.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.350
She is therefore inherently
prejudiced against me.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.270
I submit that her testimony
be stricken from the record

06:01.320 --> 06:02.350
and that the jury be instructed

06:02.400 --> 06:06.200
that she is in fact the
untrustworthy one and not me.

06:07.640 --> 06:10.950
All I ever gave her was love.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.550
Yes, well, that is utter rot,
Mr Greene. Proceed, Mr Crown.

06:16.600 --> 06:23.550
Now, um, returning to, um, er,
Morocco and the vase in question.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.070
Do you recall its delivery?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.950
No, I was out shopping at the time.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.150
When I got back to the hotel,

06:29.200 --> 06:32.750
Cleaver told me that Lydia had come past.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.470
He said the vase was a present from Ed...

06:34.520 --> 06:36.990
.. from Mr Thompson to his
mother for her birthday.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.470
He had agreed to take it back to Sydney.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.750
Yes, but to be clear, you were
not present for this conversation.

06:42.800 --> 06:44.470
- No. As I said, I was out shopping.
- So you...

06:44.520 --> 06:47.590
You have no way of knowing for
certain what actually happened

06:47.640 --> 06:51.390
or what was discussed between
your then-husband and Ms Gleeson.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.550
You are asking this court
to rely on the word of a man

06:54.600 --> 06:58.230
you have found to be
consistently untrustworthy.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.680
Nothing further, Your Honour.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.360
Hunter, what in the name of
Hieronymus Bosch is going on here?

07:07.960 --> 07:10.550
I have no recollection of giving Mr Greene

07:10.600 --> 07:15.790
an all-expenses-paid holiday
anywhere, let alone Morocco.

07:15.840 --> 07:21.830
I do recall giving him a few hundred
bucks as a sort of Christmas bonus.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.750
And what was your recollection
of the vase in question?

07:25.800 --> 07:27.830
I have none. I never saw it.

07:27.880 --> 07:32.110
I have no further questions, Your
Honour. Thank you, Mr Thompson.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.830
Your Honour...

07:35.520 --> 07:36.870
.. I believe there are some questions

07:36.920 --> 07:40.120
which need to be put
to my friend Mr Greene.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.600
Although I acknowledge
professional privilege must apply.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.790
I'd like to see Mr Crown and Miss
Huntley-Brown in my chambers, please.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.400
All rise.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.910
- Are you there, fuck for brains?
- Yeah, Cal.

08:10.960 --> 08:13.310
- Referendum first, really?
- Yep.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.110
That's bullshit!

08:15.160 --> 08:16.710
It's so fuckin' legal and constitutional.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.830
No-one gives a rat's arse.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.190
Now, what's happening over
at the Thompson debacle?

08:21.240 --> 08:24.070
I'll patch you through to Meg.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.790
Hello, Meggy, you little horn bag.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.350
What's the legal position?

08:27.400 --> 08:28.830
Oh, I don't know, Cally, nobody does.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.310
Suddenly it's all gone seriously tits

08:30.360 --> 08:31.910
and Cleaver Greene is
squarely in the frame.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.030
Cleaver Greene's in the
frame? How's that possible?

08:34.080 --> 08:36.150
- Well, the evidence...
- Shut up, Meggy. Rhetorical.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.830
Oh, Cal, one more thing.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.350
Melissa Partridge just left the building

08:39.400 --> 08:40.669
and she looks a bit shaken and stirred.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.150
The judge had to kick her out.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.830
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

08:43.880 --> 08:45.310
Cleaver used to be one of her clients.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.430
What do you want me to do?

08:46.480 --> 08:47.990
What do you think I want
you to do, Woodstein?

08:48.040 --> 08:50.430
- Woodstein?
- Oh, fuck.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.470
Just get into the studio chop
chop. Didn't you get the memo?

08:53.520 --> 08:56.390
It's totally tabloid
week here at Cal-Jazeera.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.910
Offer her, oh, five grand.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.520
Mmm.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.390
Come!

09:14.920 --> 09:17.720
OK, you two, what the hell's going on?

09:18.280 --> 09:20.310
Darling,

09:20.360 --> 09:22.590
I have no idea what you're referring to.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.750
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine!

09:25.800 --> 09:28.920
You look a bit frazzled.
Viv gone back to Paul?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.350
She's a flighty little poppet, isn't she?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.030
The Bentley didn't do the trick, then...

09:34.080 --> 09:36.430
Hunter! Don't speak about Viv.

09:36.480 --> 09:39.830
Norton, you just had a witness in the box

09:39.880 --> 09:41.630
who clearly wanted to give evidence

09:41.680 --> 09:43.710
that would help you secure a conviction.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.550
Yet you ran right over the top of her

09:45.600 --> 09:48.750
and created doubts about her credibility.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.590
Now, we all know we can't
trust Cleaver's credibility,

09:51.640 --> 09:53.630
but his wife's?

09:53.680 --> 09:56.150
You're the fucking DPP, for Christ's sake!

09:56.200 --> 09:58.230
- You sounded like defence counsel.
- Malcolm!

09:58.280 --> 10:02.470
Malcolm, I was simply
trying, as you requested,

10:02.520 --> 10:04.470
to get to the bottom of this vase matter.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.670
I think you're trying to
put Cleaver in the shit.

10:06.720 --> 10:12.390
Now, I'm going to ask you
a very serious question.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.320
Is Thompson paying you?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.920
What if he were?

10:21.280 --> 10:22.750
Right.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.960
Well, in that case, I'd
like to know how much.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.590
Darling!

10:29.640 --> 10:32.740
I was wondering when
you were going to ask.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.360
I hate these things.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.180
There is no joy in these things, Cleaver.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.790
No romance.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.320
No allure.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.990
No... Lauren Bacall.

10:55.040 --> 11:01.190
Fuck! Wish I'd been around in the
'30s. Born out of my time, I was.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.310
Weren't we all, Shirl?

11:04.480 --> 11:09.910
Mind you, I reckon I would have
preferred the '20s, or 1919.

11:09.960 --> 11:15.070
Immediate post-war, pre-Depression,
you know. Very cool time.

11:15.120 --> 11:20.070
Martinis at four, white
tie and tails at six.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.960
Everybody smoked.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.510
So what's gonna happen, Shirl?

11:37.560 --> 11:38.950
Haven't you worked it out, Cleave?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.940
Well, I think I'm for the chop, aren't I?

11:42.160 --> 11:45.100
Indeed you are, my little lamb. Only way.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.430
Ahh.

11:49.480 --> 11:50.590
So the fix is in.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.030
Oh, it's in alright, my love.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.750
Viv has gone back to Paul

11:54.800 --> 11:57.190
and she's taken her new Bentley with her.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.390
So His Honour is needing a
fifth wife and some quick cash.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.510
OK.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.790
But if the fix is in, why
can't it be in for me too?

12:06.840 --> 12:10.190
Are you dense? You can't
have a two-way fix, Cleaver.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.550
Somebody has to go down. Jesus!

12:12.600 --> 12:16.000
Shirl, my love, why don't you pop
outside and have a little puff?

12:19.880 --> 12:21.550
Sorry, Hunter.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.640
Oh, please!

12:28.680 --> 12:31.510
Don't look so innocent
and wounded, Cleaver.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.510
It makes me want to puke, it really does.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.950
I mean, you were there
with me for three years.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.440
You saw things, you heard things,
and what did you do back then?

12:41.520 --> 12:42.790
Fucking nothing.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.590
You turned a blind eye
because you wanted to get on.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.990
You wanted the fast life.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.070
You wanted to be me.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.510
Oh, yes, I was a moron, alright?

12:52.560 --> 12:54.390
I was your god.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.790
You wore what I wore, you
ate what I ate, where I ate,

12:58.840 --> 13:01.110
and you were more than
happy to take my drugs.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.750
I used to hear you on
the phone to clients.

13:03.800 --> 13:07.110
You copied my tone. You
used my expressions.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.830
I created you.

13:08.880 --> 13:14.990
But as legend tragically instructs
us, you turned into a monster.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.110
OK, God, or Dad,

13:18.160 --> 13:21.750
or whatever the fuck your
dementia makes you think you are,

13:21.800 --> 13:25.550
I'm this close to not
caring what happens next.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.110
OK? I don't...

13:27.160 --> 13:29.900
- If I died right now...
- Cleaver.

13:30.880 --> 13:34.950
Cleaver, you will die at a
precise moment of my choosing.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.230
Do you understand?

13:37.280 --> 13:40.270
In fact, I've already seen your death.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.030
It's going to take a very long time

13:43.080 --> 13:46.350
and it will be extremely painful.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.750
- Hello, everyone.
- Not a good time, Doc.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.430
No, Cleaver, I think this is a good time.

13:53.480 --> 13:55.350
- Hello, Ed.
- How lovely to see you, Wendy.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.510
Mmm.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.870
Anyway, I have something

13:57.920 --> 13:59.870
that I think that you guys
might be interested in.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.190
What is it?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.790
Photocopies of cards that Ed sent us.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.830
See, socially, you really are a
very thoughtful and civil man, Ed.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.080
Birthdays, anniversaries.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.030
I have one in here that you sent
me when my Dad lost his thumb.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.670
You kept all of them?

14:14.720 --> 14:17.830
Oh, she keeps everything.
She's got boxes of this shit.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.990
Yeah.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.350
I've kept every card that
I've received since I was 11.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.340
Including this one.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.910
It's a card that you sent me

14:25.960 --> 14:29.360
when I sent you a thank
you letter for Morocco.

14:29.960 --> 14:35.070
"Dearest Wendy, I am so glad
you had a ball in Morocco.

14:35.120 --> 14:38.590
"Your excessive gratitude embarrasses me.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.430
"Cleaver is the best
associate I've ever had,

14:41.480 --> 14:44.790
"and has earned such a
reward, as have you.

14:44.840 --> 14:49.190
"I'm already plotting where to
send you both next Christmas,"

14:49.240 --> 14:53.150
in brackets, "unless you'd
rather just go with me.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.990
"With oodles of love, Ed.

14:55.040 --> 15:00.640
"PS -- thanks for lugging
back the vase. Mum loves it."

15:01.760 --> 15:03.030
Oh, and there are five kisses.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.030
Why wasn't this produced in court?

15:06.080 --> 15:07.750
Well, this way we get to do a deal.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.550
Obviously the originals
are extremely secure

15:10.600 --> 15:12.190
and will only be used in the event

15:12.240 --> 15:15.470
that Cleaver is charged with
anything in connection with you, Ed.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.910
Or if either of us, or our loved ones,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.710
should meet with any nasty accidents.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.510
You see? Hoist on the petard
of your own social nicety.

15:23.560 --> 15:26.760
This is why I never send
thank you cards, folks.

15:28.200 --> 15:33.710
Well, Hunter, old girl, let's
get the champers on ice, huh?

15:33.760 --> 15:37.080
We're going to party like it's 1919!

15:45.560 --> 15:47.400
Ah, Melissa.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.030
Lovely to meet you.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.750
Thanks for coming at such short notice.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.740
Please, take a seat.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.590
Um, when do I get the money?

16:03.640 --> 16:05.630
Oh, as soon as we're done.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.550
Cash, right?

16:08.600 --> 16:10.750
Yes.

16:10.800 --> 16:14.430
There's some water there
if you're, uh, thirsty.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.030
Great.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.310
Rightio.

16:18.360 --> 16:23.030
Once I checked my diary, I realised
that what I had delivered to Mr...

16:23.080 --> 16:26.790
.. you, Mr Greene, was not a vase at all.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.590
That was for someone else,

16:28.640 --> 16:31.190
uh, whose name was coincidentally Green,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.750
but without the 'e' at the end.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.910
What I had delivered to
Mr Greene with the 'e'

16:36.960 --> 16:40.790
was a very small amount of
hashish, which was legal,

16:40.840 --> 16:42.630
and for purely personal use,

16:42.680 --> 16:46.670
which he certainly did not
import into this country.

16:46.720 --> 16:49.950
I apologise to the court for any
confusion that I may have caused.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.710
But, Ms Gleeson, who directed you

16:52.760 --> 16:55.270
to deliver the vase to
Mr Green without the 'e'?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.790
No-one directed me, Mr Crown.

16:57.840 --> 17:02.910
I met Mr Green without the
'e' at a party in Marrakesh.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.109
He said he bred horses in England,

17:05.160 --> 17:08.190
and that's all I can
recall, unfortunately.

17:08.240 --> 17:13.190
But there is a vase, with
an 'e', is there not?

17:13.240 --> 17:17.710
I've got a photo of it here in my bundle.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.470
Indeed, Your Honour.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.589
However, there's considerable evidence

17:21.640 --> 17:24.230
that the vase you're looking at there

17:24.280 --> 17:28.349
may not even be the vase in question.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.430
I have here an affidavit from
Assistant Commissioner Ruth Rogers

17:32.480 --> 17:34.430
who was on the team investigating
this matter at the time.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.590
She states that the chain
of evidence in this matter

17:37.640 --> 17:39.470
was probably broken,

17:39.520 --> 17:43.030
and that a corrupt but
now deceased policeman

17:43.080 --> 17:45.510
is most likely to have
been the person responsible

17:45.560 --> 17:48.990
for the importation of
the cocaine in the vase,

17:49.040 --> 17:55.080
or any vase, or the vas-es,
relating to Mr Thompson.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.750
I concur.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.550
Does that clarify things
for you, Your Honour?

18:02.600 --> 18:09.040
Well, that makes perfect
sense, Ms Huntley-Brown.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.350
So, Melissa Partridge, welcome.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.950
Now, you were there today
when sensational allegations

18:17.000 --> 18:19.190
were made against your dear
friend, Cleaver Greene.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.430
What can you tell us about them?

18:22.480 --> 18:23.910
About what?

18:23.960 --> 18:26.590
You know, the allegations
about the cocaine.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.870
There's cocaine?

18:28.920 --> 18:32.120
The cocaine in the vase.
You know, from Morocco.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.470
Cleaver has a vase of cocaine?

18:36.520 --> 18:37.710
Where?

18:37.760 --> 18:40.230
Cal, mate, we're stopping the tape.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.670
Meg needs to speak to you.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.790
- What is it, Meggy?
- Total tits, Cal.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.230
Greene's been exonerated

18:45.280 --> 18:47.590
and Thompson's been
acquitted on all charges.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.670
All charges? You're fuckin' kidding me!

18:49.720 --> 18:50.830
Every one.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.270
Oh, fuck, Hunter's good.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.430
So, uh, where is this coke?

18:57.480 --> 19:01.080
'Cause if you have some, I
could really use a line.

19:04.280 --> 19:08.120
Uh, hands up anyone on this crew
who is not currently holding.

19:12.560 --> 19:15.150
Mr Thompson! What's it like
being a free man at last?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.230
< Thank you. Thank you.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.950
I would just like to
make a statement for now.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.590
I'd like to start by saying what
a great day this is for justice,

19:22.640 --> 19:24.180
my friends.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.030
I've been looking forward
to clearing my name

19:28.080 --> 19:29.230
for nearly 20 years now.

19:29.280 --> 19:30.910
I've been hounded by the police,

19:30.960 --> 19:33.590
I've had wild accusations
thrown at me by the press.

19:33.640 --> 19:38.630
I've been defamed and vilified
by politicians of every stripe.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.830
And yet I stand before
you today a free man.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.270
And that is because the
justice system in this country

19:45.320 --> 19:46.990
works better than anywhere in the world.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.150
Mr Thompson!

19:48.200 --> 19:49.670
What are you going to do first?

19:49.720 --> 19:51.790
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Will you seek damages?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.430
I need to go and give the
good news of my freedom

19:53.480 --> 19:55.430
to my sick old mum in hospital.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.750
- Mr Thompson!
- No, no...

19:58.360 --> 20:01.030
Mr Thompson, if you could change...

20:02.560 --> 20:05.750
Mr Norton, is the New South Wales
justice system completely dead?

20:05.800 --> 20:06.790
No comment.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.070
He sounds very stern.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.990
Mr Norton, please!

20:13.280 --> 20:17.510
You know, we really do make
a dynamic duo, don't we?

20:17.560 --> 20:19.670
What do you mean, "dynamic duo"?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.550
You wanted me to throw the
cards out, do you remember?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.390
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.990
I wanted to throw them out,
you said, "No, fuck you,"

20:27.040 --> 20:30.550
and then together we reach a
mutually satisfying conclusion.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.830
This is arbitration at a very high level.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.360
Mmm.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.910
Why don't you and me go
away for the long weekend

20:39.960 --> 20:43.280
and celebrate your new-found
talent for blackmail?

20:44.680 --> 20:46.030
No!

20:46.080 --> 20:47.150
Why not?

20:47.200 --> 20:50.560
It's my..... birthday.

20:51.790 --> 20:52.790
Birthday.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.350
- Did you remember?
- Mmm, yes.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.670
- Well...
- I remember birthdays.

20:57.720 --> 20:59.590
- This'll be your...
- Ahh!

20:59.640 --> 21:02.710
Let's not say anything we can't take back.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.950
Since when do you want to
celebrate your birthday?

21:06.000 --> 21:10.590
Well, I have a pretty, um,
idiosyncratic definition

21:10.640 --> 21:15.030
of the word 'celebrate' and
what that may or may not entail.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.870
Oh, God, I'm not going away
with you for the weekend.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.390
- Well, what about dinner tonight?
- No, I can't tonight.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.870
- Why not?
- Just can't. I can't.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.030
Well, what are you doing? What's
going... What's so important?

21:25.080 --> 21:28.670
I've got dinner with Fuzz.
Every Thursday. It's our thing.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.030
Every Thursday? Since when?

21:30.080 --> 21:32.870
Why aren't I invited to these
dinners with Fuzz every...

21:32.920 --> 21:35.990
- I want to come with every Thursday...
- Because it is our time.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.430
You can have dinner with him any night.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.470
Well, I like Thursdays. I
want to come... Thursdays.

21:40.520 --> 21:43.070
And tonight. Where are
you going? Can I come?

21:43.120 --> 21:46.390
(Birthday! Birthday!)

21:46.440 --> 21:48.710
- Alright, you can come...
- Good.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.870
.. little boy.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.030
There you go.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.870
But he is moving back in.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.880
With us? Cool!

21:58.760 --> 22:02.470
So I said to him -- I mean,
this is on air, mind you --

22:02.520 --> 22:04.550
"You may call yourself the
Leader of the Opposition,

22:04.600 --> 22:07.030
"but that's only because
every idea you lead

22:07.080 --> 22:10.380
"is opposed to decency
and proper governance!"

22:15.480 --> 22:17.350
After you, milady.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.670
I mean, Davey's a
nice-enough prick, I guess.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.830
Don't know what you saw in him, though.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.910
Jeez, he'll never make premier.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.430
He just does not have the nads.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.720
He never had the nads. Shit.

22:35.190 --> 22:36.190
Really?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.110
What?

22:38.160 --> 22:40.240
Wow.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.340
So, do you know where
we can get some more?

22:52.800 --> 22:54.310
Yeah, Jizz Monkey.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.910
I need you to make me a call.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.990
No, I'm gonna need a
little bit more this time.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.990
You are Cal McGregor!

23:17.230 --> 23:18.230
Hey.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.950
Hey. Where are you?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.390
I'm just about to go into a meeting.

23:22.440 --> 23:23.790
Gav's talking about another book.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.030
Another book? What would
that one be about?

23:26.080 --> 23:29.790
My treatise on democracy
and why it doesn't work.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.550
And why you should be
our benevolent dictator?

23:32.600 --> 23:35.340
Oh, there's a bestseller right there.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.390
Hey, we need to talk, you know.

23:38.440 --> 23:39.470
Yeah.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.310
Why didn't anyone tell me?

23:41.360 --> 23:42.790
They're just waving me into the meeting.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.070
I'll give you a call back in a bit, eh?

23:44.120 --> 23:47.820
- <What time was that?
- <That's it, he's out. Fuck!

24:04.840 --> 24:06.800
Hey.

24:12.950 --> 24:13.950
Did you tell Nicole?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.630
Nuh.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.020
- Did you tell David?
- No.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.070
Oh, we just keep fighting.
And it's no-one's fault.

24:23.120 --> 24:26.150
It's just too hard.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.430
But if I do end things with David,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.710
then it won't be because
of the other night.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.870
There's no linkage.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.990
No linkage?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.070
No.

24:36.120 --> 24:39.670
OK, some linkage. A little linkage.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.990
Of course there's linkage.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.270
But after everything that's happened,

24:44.320 --> 24:46.150
we can't drag the kids
through more bullshit

24:46.200 --> 24:47.910
and you can't blow off Nicole.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.430
I have no intention of blowing off Nicole.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.110
Sorry, poor choice of words. I...

24:58.000 --> 25:01.750
Barney, if we are going to
act on this, then that's it.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.560
To the end.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.870
We can never know that.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.400
I know.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.680
Patience.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.590
I've gotta go.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.150
OK.

25:20.200 --> 25:22.550
I've got that big bash tonight, whoo-hoo!

25:22.600 --> 25:23.950
OK!

25:24.000 --> 25:25.310
I'll call you later.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.470
Hey, don't have too much fun.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.720
Don't worry, I won't.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.630
♪ You're the one

25:32.680 --> 25:36.390
♪ Who made my dreams come true

25:36.440 --> 25:40.040
♪ A few kisses ago

25:42.800 --> 25:47.870
♪ I remember you

25:47.920 --> 25:49.590
♪ You're the one who... ♪

25:49.640 --> 25:52.390
Hey! Ho! Ho, mate! Haven't
you heard of knocking?

25:52.440 --> 25:53.950
I could have been at it.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.110
Who are you murdering, Cleave?

25:55.160 --> 26:00.230
That would be Franky Ifield's
much loved classic, my friend...

26:01.280 --> 26:05.830
.. that your grandad used to
lure Grandma to the boudoir.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.750
You should be very thankful to that song.

26:07.800 --> 26:11.270
You wouldn't be here if
it weren't for that song.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.590
Feeling a little nostalgic tonight, mate.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.630
- Birthday.
- Yes, the birthday.

26:16.680 --> 26:19.150
Yeah, but you don't like birthdays.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.390
Oh, well, this one's a
bit different, isn't it?

26:21.440 --> 26:25.030
You know, happy times.
You're moving back in.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.710
Three of us out to dinner.
I'm thinking somewhere fancy.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.030
Probably Buon Riccordo, is it?

26:30.080 --> 26:33.070
The thing is, Cleave, I
don't think I can make it.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.230
What?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.350
You remember Justine?

26:35.400 --> 26:37.550
The girl I was seeing before Monique?

26:37.600 --> 26:39.070
Yeah, no idea, but go on.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.030
Well, she's leaving for Paris
tomorrow. She got into the Sorbonne.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.470
So bon for her.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.310
Well, anyway, her parents are
throwing a farewell do, so...

26:47.360 --> 26:49.590
Yes? And? It's my birthday!

26:49.640 --> 26:50.910
I know, but you always just get pissed

26:50.960 --> 26:53.150
and turn into a miserable
prick on your birthday.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.750
And this is a party her
parents are throwing

26:54.800 --> 26:58.150
at their place in Palmy, and
my ride's leaving soon, so...

26:58.200 --> 27:00.910
Oh, mate, it's my birthday. Birthday!

27:00.960 --> 27:03.910
Yeah, but Juzzy's leaving
Saturday and you'll still be here

27:03.960 --> 27:05.830
and that's when your actual
birthday is, remember?

27:05.880 --> 27:07.230
So I will be around for it.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.030
Mate, you wanna see a
prick on his birthday,

27:09.080 --> 27:10.470
have a look at me on Saturday.

27:10.520 --> 27:11.870
Yeah, Cleave, come on. I mean no offence.

27:11.920 --> 27:13.070
No offence taken on my part, mate.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.990
Don't you worry about me.

27:15.040 --> 27:17.550
It's your mum I'm concerned about.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.990
You know, your... your
special Thursday nights.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.550
Don't think I don't know about them.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.110
What about Thursday nights?

27:24.160 --> 27:25.950
Oh, that... that bond,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.270
that very special bond
between mother and son

27:29.320 --> 27:32.390
that I'd always thought was
unbreakable, but apparently not.

27:32.440 --> 27:35.390
You snap it like a twig and fuck
off up to the Northern Beaches

27:35.440 --> 27:38.190
with all your Northern
Beacher wanky mates.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.590
Whatever you say, Cleave.

27:39.640 --> 27:43.720
They're more inbred up on that
peninsula than the royals, mate.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
Have a good night.

27:59.200 --> 28:04.200
Billy! He's at the Sheraton! Yeah,
you can call off surveillance now.

28:05.360 --> 28:10.400
I need his room number and a
key, then you can go home.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.670
Have a good night, Cleave.
See you in the morning.

28:13.720 --> 28:19.320
Oh, yeah, enjoy your fancy
Northern Beaches wankers' parties.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.110
Wendy!

28:23.160 --> 28:24.230
Yeah?

28:24.280 --> 28:26.020
What's going on?

28:27.840 --> 28:29.830
Where's my... What's going on?

28:29.880 --> 28:31.750
Oh, God, he's only been back 15 minutes.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.430
- Where's my stuff?
- Look at this!

28:33.480 --> 28:35.310
I moved it into the spare room.

28:35.360 --> 28:36.630
May I ask why?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.990
Because this is Fuzz's room.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.430
- I thought this was my room.
- Yeah, only when Fuzz is not here.

28:43.480 --> 28:46.030
I'm the Daddy bear. Why
can't I have the big bed?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.830
Because this is Fuzz's big bed!

28:47.880 --> 28:50.350
I want the big... Where am I?
I'm not in the spare room?!

28:50.400 --> 28:51.870
Yeah, it has a bed.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.910
I... I can't...

28:53.960 --> 28:58.750
I am not now, and have never
been, a spare room kind of a guy.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.990
Well, your stuff fitted in very nicely.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.910
Oh, come on. Not really very good.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.700
What are you calling the spare room?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.830
Oh...

29:12.880 --> 29:14.830
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.990
You said it was just
for a couple of weeks.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.510
I... He's 20, right?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.350
He can sleep on a bed of burning nails.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.510
I... I... All he's ever
going to use that bed for

29:22.560 --> 29:25.030
is to have a wank and fall into a coma.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.820
I have to sleep. I have important...

29:28.880 --> 29:31.350
Haven't I earnt a little bit of comfort?

29:31.400 --> 29:34.150
Not really, no. It's up to you,
Cleave. Take it or leave it.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.550
But we've gotta get going in half.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.960
Oh, Jesus wept!

29:39.520 --> 29:42.550
Better be bloody Buon Riccordo.

29:42.600 --> 29:44.280
Yeah.

30:33.640 --> 30:35.640
Who the fuck are you?

30:42.710 --> 30:43.710
Ruth...

30:43.760 --> 30:45.790
Ruth, just listen to me.

30:45.840 --> 30:49.350
She's just another part of the plan,
trust me. I can tell you everything.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.470
Plan? What the fuck is going on, Ed?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.230
A fucking paralegal?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.390
You want to spend your first
night of freedom with that?

30:55.440 --> 30:56.630
Ruth...

30:56.680 --> 31:01.510
I have waited and waited and
waited for you. Almost 20 years...

31:01.560 --> 31:04.430
Ed, get the bitch the fuck out of here!

31:07.080 --> 31:08.390
Jesus!

31:08.440 --> 31:12.400
Alright, Ruth, just put the
gun down and let's talk, hm?

31:23.480 --> 31:25.310
OK, let's talk.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.950
And you can tell me everything, Ed,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.030
because, well, we've got
all the time in the world,

31:30.080 --> 31:31.390
haven't we, darling?

31:31.440 --> 31:34.030
- Ruth...
- What did I do?

31:34.080 --> 31:36.070
What did I fucking do?

31:36.120 --> 31:39.110
Because I used to be a
good cop before I met you.

31:39.160 --> 31:42.120
I made my parents proud before I met you.

31:43.240 --> 31:48.030
But I have betrayed everything
I believed in... for you.

31:48.080 --> 31:53.550
And you... you were just using me.

31:53.600 --> 31:57.560
Darling, we just need
to make a fresh start.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.540
A fresh start it is.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.880
Hi, it's me.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.080
I know I said you could
have the night off but, um...

32:36.360 --> 32:39.640
.. er, we have a little situation.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.350
Not Buon Riccordo, then?

32:43.400 --> 32:45.630
Just keep your eyes peeled.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.870
Well, just go in here. Perfect.

32:47.920 --> 32:49.150
No. No standing.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.550
Oh, don't worry about that. The
rangers won't be out at this time.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.150
- Yes, they do come out
at this time. - Rubbish.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.390
When was the last time you drove a car?

32:55.440 --> 32:56.670
When was the last time you paid a fine?

32:56.720 --> 32:57.750
They're not nocturnal.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.390
I've been driving since
I was 10 years old.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.070
Yeah, I've got nine points against me

33:02.120 --> 33:03.750
from the last three times
you borrowed my car.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.800
- Where the fuck are we?
- Oh, here we go.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.560
What the fuck is this? We only...

33:11.000 --> 33:15.830
Oh, not the bowlo. Not a surprise party!

33:15.880 --> 33:17.360
Oh, Wendy!

33:18.440 --> 33:20.910
Oh, not a surprise party!

33:20.960 --> 33:22.270
Don't spoil it!

33:22.320 --> 33:25.510
How can you spoil something that's rancid?

33:25.560 --> 33:27.230
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Oh, God!

33:27.280 --> 33:28.550
We thought, with you being in hiding,

33:28.600 --> 33:30.150
that you might quite
like a party this year.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.550
Oh, well, you thought wrong.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.590
God, you can be such a prick!

33:33.640 --> 33:35.270
Is it fear of death or
fear of getting old?

33:35.320 --> 33:39.670
Yes, yes, yes, it's all of the
above, alright? I plead guilty.

33:39.720 --> 33:41.750
I'm hitting my Kennedy point, alright?

33:41.800 --> 33:43.310
What's your Kennedy point?

33:43.360 --> 33:47.760
My Kennedy point! Dying young
and looking cool forever.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.270
I mean, what if I live until I'm 90?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.670
Oh, trust me, you won't.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.710
Yeah, but what if I do,
and then I die, and I'm 90

33:54.760 --> 33:57.510
and there's a picture of me
as a 90-year-old in the paper.

33:57.560 --> 33:59.630
Oh, there's not going to be a
picture of you in the paper, Cleave.

33:59.680 --> 34:00.630
Oh, God!

34:00.680 --> 34:02.470
Cleave, can you try and have a good time?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.270
No! No, alright?

34:04.320 --> 34:08.429
Every birthday is a kiss
farewell to my youth.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.670
Yeah, I think you might have kissed
your youth goodbye 15 years ago.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.710
And if I recall correctly,
her name was Abigail.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.070
Oh, God. My sisters!

34:17.120 --> 34:20.230
You invited Reagan and
Gonorrhoea? Why would you do that?

34:20.280 --> 34:23.989
Is anybody good coming?
Are there lawyers in here?

34:24.040 --> 34:26.989
You know, distinguished
colleagues, members of the bar?

34:27.040 --> 34:28.030
Are there judges?

34:28.080 --> 34:30.949
I don't know, I left that with Barney.

34:31.000 --> 34:31.949
Oh, shit.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.350
Are there gonna be speeches or something?

34:33.400 --> 34:34.429
Do I have to make a speech?

34:34.480 --> 34:35.790
Yeah. Barney's going to say a few words.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.110
Barney? Don't let Barney speak.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.830
He'll just talk about
how much money I owe him

34:38.880 --> 34:40.150
after the fucking picnic basket.

34:40.199 --> 34:41.909
- For fuck's sake, Cleaver!
- What?

34:41.960 --> 34:44.830
Can you please try and have a good time?

34:44.880 --> 34:47.989
I'm asking you nicely.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.510
Come on.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.560
I don't think so, no.

34:52.920 --> 34:58.110
Oh, Wendy, why is it so dark in here?
Is there a blackout or something?

34:58.160 --> 35:00.590
- What?
- Surprise!

35:00.640 --> 35:02.150
Oh, what?

35:02.200 --> 35:07.110
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

35:07.160 --> 35:09.830
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow

35:09.880 --> 35:13.070
♪ And so say all of us

35:13.120 --> 35:15.270
♪ And so say all of us... ♪

35:15.320 --> 35:19.110
Oh, yes!

35:19.160 --> 35:21.790
With your Northern Beaches bullshit.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.550
Oh, I wouldn't have missed
it for the world, Cleave.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.630
- Have a good night. See ya.
- What?

35:25.680 --> 35:27.910
I told you, I'm off to Palmy.
Quick slash then I'm off.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.900
Oh, so still Palmy?

35:36.320 --> 35:39.030
"Jason shone the lighthouse
beacon onto the ship.

35:39.080 --> 35:43.550
"But the townsfolk realised that
the ship was being steered by..."

35:43.600 --> 35:45.710
T-Rex!

35:45.760 --> 35:48.280
Duh, duh-duh, duh.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.110
One of us is still
actually eating, you know?

35:54.160 --> 35:56.270
Yeah, I've gotta finish
these boxes tonight.

35:56.320 --> 35:57.790
School holidays start next Tuesday.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.750
If I don't get it done,
it's going to be chaos.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.070
Didn't you bring that
box down a few days ago?

36:02.120 --> 36:03.910
The Mexican mask. I remember.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.750
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I did.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.790
I mean, I come over here,

36:06.840 --> 36:08.790
and you're just...
you're bringing boxes down

36:08.840 --> 36:10.110
and taking them back up again.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.710
It's crazy.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.240
David?

36:16.880 --> 36:19.910
The kids, they...

36:19.960 --> 36:21.900
They hate your guts.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.500
I know.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.500
Are you gonna be OK?

36:50.680 --> 36:52.830
Did anyone know about you and him?

36:52.880 --> 36:55.080
I mean, apart from me?

37:01.800 --> 37:04.400
Do you want to go and get a drink?

37:06.400 --> 37:07.920
Uh, no.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.620
- Thanks, Billy, you can go.
- You sure?

37:45.040 --> 37:47.270
They're not going to like
anyone other than their father,

37:47.320 --> 37:48.790
for God knows how long.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.030
You can't just put your life on hold.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.710
Oh, yes. Yes, I can.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.550
They're my kids.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.630
And I wouldn't understand because
I don't have kids, right?

37:57.680 --> 37:58.710
Yes.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.990
Well, guess how old I
was when my dad bolted?

38:01.040 --> 38:02.190
You were six years old.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.310
That's right, I was six years old.

38:04.360 --> 38:06.270
The notion that you have to be a parent

38:06.320 --> 38:08.470
in order to understand kids is bullshit.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.430
Because we were all kids once.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.790
I mean, apart from having to breathe,

38:11.840 --> 38:15.670
it's the one thing that every
person on the planet has in common.

38:15.720 --> 38:17.630
When my mother started dating again,

38:17.680 --> 38:19.550
I thought it was the end of the world.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.150
I thought I was Oliver Twist.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.350
You read Dickens when
you were six years old?

38:23.400 --> 38:27.990
I was in the musical, as a
workhouse boy, which didn't help.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.910
Now, I... I did everything I could

38:29.960 --> 38:32.710
to destroy the few relationships
my mother had when I was a boy.

38:32.760 --> 38:35.150
I was a little shit. She was mine.

38:35.200 --> 38:37.350
That was it, as far as I was concerned.

38:37.400 --> 38:41.070
Now, I'm sure those poor bastards
I tormented and drove away

38:41.120 --> 38:42.190
were all decent men.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.680
But now she lives all alone
in that small house...

38:46.760 --> 38:48.470
.. where you and I used to make love.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.950
You can't scare me

38:51.000 --> 38:54.550
into resurrecting whatever it
is we think we might have had.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.080
OK.

38:57.360 --> 39:00.300
Let me play the lowest card in the deck.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.500
I love you.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.440
I miss Barney, David.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.380
I'm sorry, but I do.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.950
Many happy returns, Cleave.

39:37.000 --> 39:37.990
Oh, thanks, mate.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.430
See you on the dance floor, mate.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.590
Yeah.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.110
Ahh.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.390
Evening. Always good to
hang out with your old mates.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.710
Isn't it?

39:48.760 --> 39:50.470
A lot of criminals here tonight, Barn.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.150
- A lot of serious criminals.
- They're clients.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.910
Clients of longstanding who've
come to pay their respects.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.350
You invited a lot of
criminals to my birthday.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.470
You're a criminal lawyer.

39:59.520 --> 40:00.790
- As are you.
- Exactly.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.710
So what's your complaint?

40:02.760 --> 40:04.750
Ohh.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.790
He raped his brother. He raped his...

40:07.840 --> 40:10.710
You invited a brother
rapist to my birthday.

40:10.760 --> 40:12.110
He was acquitted.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.550
And we all know how that happened.

40:13.600 --> 40:17.350
There's not a Silk in sight, mate.
There's not a Supreme in sight.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.870
There are two District
Court judges here, Cleave.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.110
Two DCs! Wow, mate.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.110
Don't think I don't know what's
going on, Barnyard. I'm on to you.

40:25.160 --> 40:27.550
You are deliberately
white-anting my birthday

40:27.600 --> 40:29.390
because of this hot-air balloon bullshit.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.910
How dare you think I'd do that!

40:32.840 --> 40:35.230
And it's 1.2 million, Cleave.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.990
It's not something to be sneered at.

40:37.040 --> 40:38.350
Do you know what, mate?

40:38.400 --> 40:40.950
Save it for your speech. Oh,
really looking forward to that.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.670
That'll be a happy melange of
Dorothy Parker and Truman Capote

40:44.720 --> 40:46.510
and a little bit of Dr Goebbels as well.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.870
The world really needs to know
what a great hero you are, mate,

40:49.920 --> 40:52.590
and what a thoughtless ball sac I am.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.110
- Happy birthday, Cleave.
- Thank you.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.430
Jesus, you two are still at it?

40:55.480 --> 40:58.830
- Yeah, well he's...
- I mean, it was a present, alright?

40:58.880 --> 41:03.670
A beautiful balloon ride present,
and now it's costing me 600 grand.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.750
Well, I think that he just
wants to talk about it.

41:05.800 --> 41:09.070
I can't talk about 600 grand.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.790
I may as well owe the
American national debt,

41:11.840 --> 41:14.270
or a handful of magical beans.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.670
Look, it's a lovely party.

41:16.720 --> 41:19.150
There is a lot of love in the room.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.190
From the criminal class.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.430
A lot of love from the criminal...

41:22.480 --> 41:25.310
It's like the fucking Madame
Tussaud's of crime in here.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.430
Look at all these faces from our past.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.230
GBH, GB... Manslaughter.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.950
There's... Oh, break and enter.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.990
- Oh, there's Marvin.
Remember Marvin? - Mm-hm.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.150
Loved to give it a tug in front of nuns.

41:36.200 --> 41:38.550
But it's not just the
faces, is it, Nicole?

41:38.600 --> 41:41.310
It's the whole merry ambience.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.390
I mean, what a... Look at it. Nothing...

41:43.440 --> 41:45.590
And for me, nothing says celebration

41:45.640 --> 41:50.830
so much as a cash bar with two
types of wine, red and white.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.950
Who would have thought?

41:55.440 --> 41:57.510
OK.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.160
Speeches!

42:00.960 --> 42:02.830
Come on!

42:02.880 --> 42:06.550
Apart from his sisters, Lily and
Jane, who are with us tonight...

42:07.840 --> 42:11.640
.. I think I've known Cleaver longer
than anyone here, for my sins.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.750
I'm sure you all presumed I'd be
the one giving the big speech,

42:16.800 --> 42:20.590
but there's someone else in this
room who's been very close to Cleaver

42:20.640 --> 42:22.790
over the last few years,

42:22.840 --> 42:26.310
who's really connected with
him, touched his heart.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.900
A man of eminence and great wit.

42:29.760 --> 42:32.590
And, of course, a great legal brain.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.440
Ladies and gentlemen, Lincoln Lincoln.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.550
I was surprised and...

42:45.600 --> 42:47.750
.. and honoured and deeply touched

42:47.800 --> 42:52.270
when Barney asked me to speak
tonight... very recently.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.710
And as luck would have it,

42:53.760 --> 42:57.060
and as someone who is
very close to Cleaver...

42:57.600 --> 43:00.540
.. I prepared something a little earlier.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.590
Oh, just... just before I do that,

43:02.640 --> 43:08.390
I should explain that you have
to imagine that I am Cleaver

43:08.440 --> 43:11.680
playing the Lord High
Executioner in The Mikado.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.870
And Cleaver is a bit of a fuss pot

43:14.920 --> 43:17.190
and has a certain way
of going about things

43:17.240 --> 43:20.030
which, if you didn't know,

43:20.080 --> 43:21.830
it probably wouldn't
really make any sense.

43:21.880 --> 43:24.620
But anyway, here we go. I'll just...

I just wanted to say happy
birthday to my little brother.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.190
Here's to Cleaver.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.870
To Cleaver!

44:23.920 --> 44:27.950
But more importantly, I would
like to talk to you tonight

44:28.000 --> 44:31.040
about the direction our
nation is heading in.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.280
We're living in anxious times, my friends.

44:36.320 --> 44:42.400
Issues of national economic and
environmental dilemmas plague us.

44:43.960 --> 44:46.270
We need to have leadership

44:46.320 --> 44:50.870
that just doesn't cater
to the fringes of society.

44:50.920 --> 44:56.950
We need to have leadership that
is strong and understanding.

44:57.000 --> 45:02.160
Leadership that embraces all
Australians. National leadership!

45:03.640 --> 45:08.070
That is why I am proud to
announce to you all here tonight

45:08.120 --> 45:10.310
my candidacy for the Senate,

45:10.360 --> 45:15.430
as a candidate for the National Party
in the forthcoming federal election.

45:22.280 --> 45:25.000
So, what do you think?

45:28.800 --> 45:31.590
Well, I think it's clear now

45:31.640 --> 45:35.230
that she no longer poses
just a threat to herself,

45:35.280 --> 45:37.310
but to the wider community,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.360
and we can have her sectioned
under the Mental Health Act.

45:42.200 --> 45:43.390
Dad voted for the Nats.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.270
Yes, yes,

45:45.320 --> 45:49.030
but Dad also used to talk about
how much he loved a Chinky meal.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.390
I mean, he was well ahead
of his time in that regard.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.110
Holy shit.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.870
How pissed is she?

45:55.920 --> 45:58.270
She's serious, Cleave. She's running.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.760
And I'm her campaign manager.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.230
Ohh.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.880
Nostradamus was right, after all.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.150
Connie, what have we got?

46:18.200 --> 46:21.270
Lydia Gleeson and Edgar Thompson.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.390
OK, Billy, what can you
tell me about what happened?

46:23.440 --> 46:25.470
Well, the details are
sketchy at best, boss.

46:25.520 --> 46:29.120
The bodies were found in
a landfill near Lidcombe.

46:29.800 --> 46:31.990
OK, I want forensics combing the scene.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.680
Gotcha.

46:39.840 --> 46:43.430
Ahh. Yes, thank you.

46:43.480 --> 46:46.520
Wow... Wow.

46:48.400 --> 46:51.270
Looking around at all these faces,

46:51.320 --> 46:54.440
the faces of my nearest and dearest...

46:55.760 --> 46:58.390
.. oh, you get to see the real meaning,

46:58.440 --> 47:02.430
the totality of your existence.

47:02.480 --> 47:04.320
And...

47:06.400 --> 47:09.630
And...

47:09.680 --> 47:11.310
Oh, fuck.

47:19.280 --> 47:20.680
I'm s...

47:21.760 --> 47:23.240
Oh, God.

47:29.560 --> 47:35.360
And like so many things in this
life, it makes me think of Yeats.

47:36.920 --> 47:42.080
How many loved your moments of sad grace?

47:44.040 --> 47:48.600
And loved your beauty
with love False or true

47:50.720 --> 47:55.160
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you

47:57.080 --> 48:00.800
And loved the sorrows
of your changing face.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.030
Here's to bow-legged women!

48:08.080 --> 48:10.640
Bow-legged women!

48:14.520 --> 48:17.190
Oh, yeah.

48:17.240 --> 48:20.640
Oh, you helped yourself
to my birthday prezzie.

48:30.640 --> 48:34.070
Did you hear Jane's announced
she's nominating for the Senate?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.110
Jesus.

48:36.160 --> 48:41.470
Holy Mother Mary, pray for us now
and at the hour the polls close.

48:41.520 --> 48:43.230
I don't want to have to emigrate.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.790
Nor do I.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.230
So, listen, mate,

48:46.280 --> 48:52.950
I know you didn't want
to be in a picnic basket

48:53.000 --> 48:55.670
on your way to New Zealand,

48:55.720 --> 49:00.510
but I honestly can't... I
can't take on a 600,000 bill...

49:00.560 --> 49:01.750
I slept with Scarlet.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.510
You're shittin' me.

49:04.560 --> 49:08.030
Look, just for the ease
of future conversations,

49:08.080 --> 49:09.630
can you not say 'you're shittin' me'

49:09.680 --> 49:13.230
if I tell you I fucked
either Scarlet or Nicole?

49:13.280 --> 49:15.270
'Cause you say it every time.

49:15.320 --> 49:17.230
Oh.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.830
Oh, fair enough.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.360
Oh, mate. Last hurrah?

49:25.640 --> 49:28.710
I don't think so.

49:28.760 --> 49:31.670
I don't know.

49:31.720 --> 49:36.270
What about Nicole and
baby... E-I-E-I-O-ain?

49:36.320 --> 49:38.430
- Yes, I know. Fuck!
- Oh, fuck!

49:38.480 --> 49:40.230
Fuck and fuck.

49:40.280 --> 49:42.670
That's the firm we should start.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.990
I know, or I don't know.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.750
That's the thing. None
of us knows anything.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.910
- None of us knows...
- None of us is sure about anything.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.510
Rumsfeld knew.

49:51.560 --> 49:54.790
The known unknown or the
unknown... What was it?

49:54.840 --> 49:56.830
The 'unknown known'.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.020
We know we know nothing.

50:00.720 --> 50:03.750
Lincoln Lincoln.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.280
Mikado.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.260
It was a masterstroke, mate.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.110
You knobhead.

50:12.160 --> 50:14.550
You shoved that up my clacker, didn't you?

50:14.600 --> 50:17.000
Right up your fuckin' clacker.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.030
Pour me some of that shit.

50:31.080 --> 50:34.680
Yeah, of course, you
bastard. Drink up, you prick.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.310

a li-lo in Fuzz's room.

What?!

54:21.360 --> 54:23.670
Mama!

54:23.720 --> 54:27.150
There is a trend back to a little
bit more growth down there now.
