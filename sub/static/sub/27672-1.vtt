WEBVTT

00:07.373 --> 00:09.748
This country's gone down the pan.
I'll tell you why.

00:09.784 --> 00:11.147
I was quite enjoying
the silence, you know.

00:11.171 --> 00:14.336
People used to respect each other.
Kids respected adults.

00:14.547 --> 00:15.549
No, they didn't.

00:15.585 --> 00:18.442
- Criminals respected coppers.
- Give me one example.

00:22.842 --> 00:25.807
I blame that fellow, with the pelvis.
What's his name?

00:25.843 --> 00:27.924
- Elvis.
- All that thrusting.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.817
His name rhymes with pelvis.

00:29.853 --> 00:31.421
- And the grinding!
- How do you not remember that?

00:31.445 --> 00:33.062
In front of the kids as well.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.925
- I miss the old days.
- Which bit?

00:38.960 --> 00:41.343
The wars? The bombs?
The abject misery?

00:41.379 --> 00:43.936
- At least you knew your neighbours.
- The ones that weren't dead.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.120
It's not the same any more.

00:46.963 --> 00:48.149
That's all I'm saying.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.333
That's him, Geordie.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.580
Jim Parsons.

00:55.615 --> 00:58.310
I'm arresting you for theft
and grievous bodily...

00:58.757 --> 01:00.410
All right, let's not
play silly buggers.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.825
Leave him.

01:03.053 --> 01:05.018
Sidney! Leave him.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

02:05.631 --> 02:06.631
Ooh!

02:09.616 --> 02:11.135
What did I say?

02:13.436 --> 02:14.921
Something about a pelvis?

02:14.957 --> 02:17.870
You've got to stop doing this.
Are you listening to me?

02:18.544 --> 02:20.344
No more bloody heroics.

02:27.184 --> 02:30.494
Would you open your books
to hymn number seven?

02:30.960 --> 02:33.847
Christ Whose Glory
Fills The Skies.

02:34.231 --> 02:35.753
Item number five.

02:36.139 --> 02:39.538
- A very grave matter.
- A very grave matter indeed.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.667
Mould in the vestry.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.925
Hymn number 520,

02:44.233 --> 02:46.707
Love Divine All Loves Excelling.

02:46.797 --> 02:51.484
Baking soda, water and a vigorous
scrubbing with a sturdy brush.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.924
Vigorous... scrubbing.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.086
I suppose that would
work, Mrs Chapman,

02:56.122 --> 02:59.087
if you're not averse to
corroding the stonework.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.423
Hymn number 573.

03:01.576 --> 03:04.541
I suggest two parts vinegar,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.623
and three parts water.

03:06.659 --> 03:08.242
Buff robustly

03:08.278 --> 03:11.805
- with a soft cloth.
- Buff... robustly.

03:13.803 --> 03:16.499
I suppose vinegar would be
acceptable, Mrs Bennett,

03:16.535 --> 03:19.500
if you weren't adverse
to the House of our Lord

03:19.536 --> 03:21.416
reeking like a chip shop.

03:22.171 --> 03:25.137
Item number six, a
very serious matter.

03:25.173 --> 03:26.925
A very serious matter indeed.

03:27.362 --> 03:28.648
The church fete.

03:28.684 --> 03:31.649
I suggest we give it a
good deal of thought.

03:31.685 --> 03:33.420
I would go further, Mrs Bennett,

03:33.456 --> 03:36.079
and say we give it
considerable thought.

03:36.627 --> 03:38.787
Make a note of that,
if you would, Leonard.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.354
<i>I was ready to poke their
eyes out with a pencil.</i>

03:42.390 --> 03:44.290
I was ready to poke my own
eyes out with a pencil

03:44.314 --> 03:45.821
just to make it
remotely tolerable.

03:45.857 --> 03:48.689
- It is part of your job, Sidney.
- Considerable thought?

03:48.725 --> 03:49.743
It's a fete!

03:49.943 --> 03:53.031
- It's exactly the same every year.
- Well, I rather enjoy it.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.308
You read Dostoevsky for fun.

03:55.344 --> 03:57.309
What's this talk about again?

03:57.345 --> 03:59.925
Religion's role in the
civil rights struggle.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.925
Wouldn't you rather
go to the pictures?

04:03.226 --> 04:05.191
You're always telling
me I lack inspiration.

04:05.227 --> 04:06.412
What could be more inspiring?

04:06.448 --> 04:08.063
The King And I.

04:08.670 --> 04:10.474
I hear Deborah Carr's wonderful.

04:12.147 --> 04:15.580
More men of God. You're crawling
out of the woodwork today.

04:15.616 --> 04:16.983
It's the lure of a free buffet.

04:17.019 --> 04:18.894
- How are you, Professor Barkley?
- Good.

04:19.147 --> 04:22.287
For Reverend Todd's organisation.
All donations gratefully received.

04:27.172 --> 04:29.925
We've attracted a pious bunch.
It's dull as tombs in there.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.936
- Go and lighten things up, would you?
- We'll do our best.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.580
Darling, drink for
these gentlemen.

04:33.616 --> 04:35.102
Yes. Follow me, please.

04:39.756 --> 04:42.176
I was saving that penny
for an iced bun.

04:42.212 --> 04:43.720
Oh, stop moaning.

04:48.640 --> 04:49.732
Leonard.

04:50.264 --> 04:51.264
Will!

04:51.467 --> 04:53.432
- Good to see you.
- Word of warning.

04:53.585 --> 04:56.289
If they're not wearing a dog collar,
they're a theology student.

04:56.874 --> 04:59.086
I just spent the last 20
minutes avoiding eye contact.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.060
Sidney.

05:01.764 --> 05:04.729
This is Will Davenport,
chaplain at Corpus.

05:04.765 --> 05:06.617
Ah, how do you do?

05:06.653 --> 05:09.351
- I owe you a debt of gratitude.
- Really?

05:09.387 --> 05:12.088
Well, the Dean thinks
that I'm a liability.

05:12.320 --> 05:14.936
But apparently you were worse, so
thank you for sharing the burden.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.309
You're more than welcome.

05:16.670 --> 05:19.670
Ah, that's him. Reverend
Nathaniel Todd.

05:22.515 --> 05:24.480
Good morning. Nice to meet you.

05:24.631 --> 05:25.775
Hello.

05:26.725 --> 05:28.778
I'm Violet. Nice to meet you.

05:42.147 --> 05:43.468
Just beautiful.

05:46.159 --> 05:48.924
They are paste, all
kinds of paste.

05:49.014 --> 05:50.609
Fish, meat.

05:50.645 --> 05:53.129
Bet you're disappointed you
came in here now, huh?

05:53.165 --> 05:55.068
Oh, I didn't come in
here for the sandwiches.

05:55.295 --> 05:57.260
You looked like you could
do with the company.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.925
- I'm fine.
- You were talking to a painting.

06:01.452 --> 06:02.623
I was...

06:02.742 --> 06:04.083
communing with it.

06:04.733 --> 06:06.343
It's older than my
entire country.

06:06.615 --> 06:09.077
- Not quite.
- Give or take a few years.

06:10.160 --> 06:11.857
Try a hundred.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.210
Paste and pedantry.

06:14.246 --> 06:15.999
You Brits have it all.

06:16.608 --> 06:18.164
Would you not even
consider, sir...

06:18.200 --> 06:20.343
I think it makes us look
like cowards, Mr Deveaux.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.808
With all due respect, sir,
who cares how it looks?

06:22.844 --> 06:24.969
Papa, please, just
think about it.

06:25.005 --> 06:27.130
I came here to speak and
that is what I shall do.

06:27.578 --> 06:29.578
- Letty.
- Yes, Papa.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.065
Don't trust 'em!

06:39.116 --> 06:41.365
Go back to where you came from!

06:42.976 --> 06:44.535
Keep Britain white!

06:48.233 --> 06:49.691
Go home, Todd!

07:14.383 --> 07:16.992
Good afternoon. It's
my great privilege

07:17.028 --> 07:18.662
to introduce our guest today,

07:18.698 --> 07:21.234
here on the first leg
of a fund-raising tour

07:21.270 --> 07:22.783
from Richmond, Alabama.

07:22.819 --> 07:24.784
An activist, an orator,

07:24.820 --> 07:26.090
and now a friend,

07:26.960 --> 07:28.393
Reverend Nathaniel Todd.

07:35.116 --> 07:36.689
Thank you, Henry.

07:37.553 --> 07:39.553
I am no activist.

07:40.350 --> 07:41.902
I'm no orator.

07:42.702 --> 07:44.742
I'm simply a man of God.

07:46.053 --> 07:47.321
Last year,

07:48.163 --> 07:50.495
a negro boy in my town,

07:50.531 --> 07:52.200
14 years of age,

07:52.499 --> 07:53.659
was lynched

07:53.998 --> 07:55.646
by a group of white men.

07:56.399 --> 07:57.404
Why?

07:58.589 --> 08:02.739
Because he had the audacity
to buy a white girl a soda.

08:04.553 --> 08:07.136
That night, people
came to my church.

08:08.326 --> 08:10.326
They came to pray.

08:11.522 --> 08:14.012
Because when you
are persecuted...

08:14.968 --> 08:16.854
..when you are victimised,

08:17.499 --> 08:20.553
when there is no-one
else to turn to,

08:20.589 --> 08:22.629
who do you turn to?

08:24.131 --> 08:25.174
God.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.858
Amen.

08:26.894 --> 08:30.388
And the hand of the
Lord was with them.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.924
It is God who has
brought me here today.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.583
It is God who has
brought you here.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.625
We are all God's children.

08:36.660 --> 08:41.032
Shall be to his brethren, and
the Lord set a mark upon Cain!

08:41.068 --> 08:43.328
- Sit down, sir.
- You have no right to speak here.

08:43.365 --> 08:46.036
- Sit down, Gregory.
- He has no right to speak!

08:46.072 --> 08:49.271
- Sit down.
- You want the Negro to rule.

08:49.307 --> 08:51.404
- Get him out.
- The Negro will never rule!

08:51.440 --> 08:53.085
Sit down before I
make you sit down!

08:53.121 --> 08:54.768
Charles, you leave it now.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.925
Go home, Todd!

09:02.960 --> 09:04.501
Let's go.

09:10.058 --> 09:11.285
Sidney!

09:11.320 --> 09:12.925
Bloody racists!

09:18.106 --> 09:21.138
- We shouldn't have come here.
- I knew we shouldn't have come here.

09:21.174 --> 09:22.854
- They were fireworks.
- They're fireworks.

09:49.060 --> 09:50.060
Charles.

09:57.194 --> 09:58.194
Charles?

10:00.778 --> 10:02.456
Let me see, let me see.

10:02.788 --> 10:04.479
- Oh, God.
- Charles!

10:04.515 --> 10:05.750
Help him!

10:06.726 --> 10:08.691
Hold on, son. Stay with us now.

10:08.727 --> 10:10.446
- Somebody get help!
- Look at me. Charles.

10:10.482 --> 10:11.482
Hold on.

10:12.084 --> 10:15.375
Charles, look at us now.
Stay with us now.

10:15.411 --> 10:17.536
- You're gonna be all right.
- Stay with me.

10:17.572 --> 10:19.732
Look at us now. Hold on.

10:32.410 --> 10:35.012
- Find a knife?
- Not yet, guv. Sorry.

10:37.206 --> 10:39.701
For God's sake, have
some bloody respect.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.398
- Did you see what happened?
- I was just trying not to die.

10:46.523 --> 10:47.875
That makes a change.

10:49.035 --> 10:50.848
I lost my shoe.

10:51.610 --> 10:54.546
Guv, the black man
won't let us move him.

10:54.769 --> 10:56.312
He's making a right
song and dance.

11:04.310 --> 11:06.310
OK, we need to
move him now, sir.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.554
Let them see what
they did to him.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.496
Let them see!

11:12.410 --> 11:14.227
Go home, Todd.

11:14.410 --> 11:16.535
- Go, go, move.
- We don't want you here.

11:16.571 --> 11:17.650
Move!

11:18.574 --> 11:20.381
- Get the body out of here.
- Yes, guv.

11:27.151 --> 11:30.243
- Get in the van.
- You're making us look like criminals.

11:30.279 --> 11:33.623
I don't care. Get in. I
cannot guarantee your safety.

11:33.986 --> 11:35.851
We feel a lot safer out here

11:35.887 --> 11:37.587
than we ever would in there.
Come on.

11:50.761 --> 11:53.726
Why ain't you speaking to that boy?
The one shouting his mouth off.

11:53.762 --> 11:54.767
Gregory Jones.

11:55.450 --> 11:57.538
He's a rather opinionated
student of mine.

11:57.574 --> 11:58.826
He's a vile bigot.

11:58.862 --> 12:00.849
He's a first year who's
listened to too much Mosley.

12:00.873 --> 12:02.289
We'll talk to him, don't worry.

12:02.325 --> 12:04.290
But we do worry, officer.

12:05.410 --> 12:08.014
Why was your son
afraid, Mr Todd?

12:08.050 --> 12:10.432
He wanted you to
cancel the talk.

12:19.910 --> 12:22.387
The reverend's had one a
day since we got here.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.729
The Phineas Society.

12:26.931 --> 12:28.896
"If you speak
today, know that...

12:29.881 --> 12:32.049
"Jephthah's fate
shall be your own."

12:32.870 --> 12:34.410
What happened to Jephthah?

12:35.533 --> 12:37.600
His daughter was killed.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.630
May I have a bowl
of water, please?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.366
You can't touch him.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.652
I bathed him on his first
day in this world.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.200
I shall bathe him on his last.

13:22.950 --> 13:24.457
The Phineas Society?

13:25.800 --> 13:27.004
Who's Phineas?

13:27.656 --> 13:31.375
He killed an Israelite man
and a Midianite woman

13:31.410 --> 13:33.375
to punish them for
intermingling.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.375
Sounds like a barrel of laughs.

13:35.410 --> 13:37.875
- You wrote these letters?
- They're treatises.

13:38.940 --> 13:42.375
Does it salve your
feelings of inadequacy,

13:42.410 --> 13:43.950
spilling out this hate?

13:44.410 --> 13:46.375
Who else is in this
society of yours?

13:46.410 --> 13:49.413
There are many of us.
We are everywhere.

13:49.449 --> 13:52.128
- Names?
- Secret society.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.324
An organisation whose members
are sworn to secrecy.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.839
We've got enough to charge him.

13:58.875 --> 14:01.374
- You're bluffing.
- You made death threats, Gregory.

14:01.410 --> 14:03.637
- They're not death threats, they're...
- Treatises.

14:04.949 --> 14:07.754
He hath made of one blood
all nations of men

14:07.790 --> 14:10.319
to dwell on all the
face of the Earth

14:10.355 --> 14:14.126
and the bounds of their habitation
that they might seek...

14:15.410 --> 14:17.951
I've got officers outside. I'd like
to put another one in the house.

14:17.975 --> 14:19.539
To guard them or
keep an eye on them?

14:19.575 --> 14:21.540
Miss Todd was mentioned
in those letters.

14:22.269 --> 14:24.803
Till we've accounted for all
members of this Phineas Society...

14:24.839 --> 14:28.269
It's decided. Mr Deveaux will
accompany my daughter home.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.787
She leaves tomorrow.

14:30.410 --> 14:31.671
No-one's going anywhere.

14:32.646 --> 14:34.011
Not till this is sorted.

14:35.247 --> 14:38.618
I cannot lose both
my children, sir.

14:38.654 --> 14:40.698
Then you let me put another
one of my men in here.

14:40.734 --> 14:41.734
I'll stay.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.310
I'll stay if you want me to.

14:47.226 --> 14:48.506
Thank you, Reverend.

14:53.450 --> 14:57.613
When we were first married, Henry
would introduce me as his rani.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.236
What does it mean?

14:59.272 --> 15:00.290
Queen.

15:01.237 --> 15:03.632
People assumed it meant "maid",

15:03.668 --> 15:05.633
or worse, "concubine".

15:06.034 --> 15:07.552
They couldn't comprehend

15:07.588 --> 15:10.179
- that we were in love.
- Madiah.

15:12.810 --> 15:14.170
Excuse me.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.375
Geordie, the policeman,

15:21.410 --> 15:22.729
he's a friend of mine.

15:22.765 --> 15:24.234
He's a police officer.

15:24.270 --> 15:26.451
Even so, he's not the
kind to discriminate.

15:26.487 --> 15:28.191
He's a police officer.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.672
He'll blame us soon enough.

15:35.824 --> 15:37.542
I thought it'd be
different here.

15:38.410 --> 15:39.967
I thought it'd be a
little brighter.

15:41.449 --> 15:43.237
A little more hopeful.

15:43.706 --> 15:45.084
<i>Our first night here,</i>

15:45.386 --> 15:48.968
<i>people were so
welcoming, so kind.</i>

15:50.578 --> 15:51.859
We danced.

15:53.026 --> 15:54.640
<i>And we laughed.</i>

15:58.214 --> 16:00.394
At least you know where
you stand in Alabama.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.311
At least you know they hate you.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.608
Come and dance.

16:17.332 --> 16:18.926
What, to this claptrap?

16:19.355 --> 16:22.509
- You're such a square.
- You know where you are with a square.

16:22.886 --> 16:24.907
Es, set the table.

16:25.831 --> 16:27.581
Come on, Daddy.

16:29.337 --> 16:30.895
Come on. Spin her.

16:30.930 --> 16:32.360
Spin her.

16:35.069 --> 16:36.835
Is everybody still breathing?

16:38.868 --> 16:40.754
Oh, thank Christ for that.

17:10.493 --> 17:12.471
- There's someone up here.
- Should I get the officer?

17:12.494 --> 17:14.494
- No.
- In there.

17:37.793 --> 17:39.375
- You know Dotty.
- No.

17:39.410 --> 17:42.097
Oh, yes, you do.
From Haberdashery.

17:42.535 --> 17:46.375
She says to me, there's a
shoplifter doing the rounds.

17:46.410 --> 17:49.375
So I say to Pauline
from Undies...

17:49.410 --> 17:51.490
- I don't know who Pauline is.
- Let's set a trap.

17:51.859 --> 17:54.959
So we put out a tray of tie
pins by Maureen's counter.

17:54.995 --> 17:56.735
- You know Maureen.
- No.

17:56.770 --> 17:58.268
She was loving it.

17:58.304 --> 18:00.714
Since when were my wages
not enough, Cathy?

18:02.249 --> 18:04.445
I'm not having this
conversation again, Geordie.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.175
Hello.

18:16.601 --> 18:17.868
Whose room is this?

18:18.277 --> 18:19.536
Miss Todd's.

18:23.886 --> 18:25.485
We need to get her out of here.

18:46.574 --> 18:48.699
The young lady is in...?

18:48.735 --> 18:50.180
She's in my room.

18:50.216 --> 18:52.004
The vicar and the other chap?

18:52.040 --> 18:54.375
- They're in here.
- So where are you?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.084
I'm in Leonard's room.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.120
- Where the Dickens is Leonard?
- At Daniel's.

19:00.601 --> 19:02.195
It's cos Daniel's away.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.468
Fishing.

19:05.003 --> 19:06.672
So I'll have the
house to myself.

19:07.128 --> 19:09.128
I'll be completely,
completely alone.

19:11.343 --> 19:12.468
Fishing?

19:12.914 --> 19:16.410
- If you please.
- Please make yourselves at home.

19:18.090 --> 19:20.415
- If you like, you can sleep here, Mr Todd.
- Thank you.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.152
Couldn't they stay in
a bed and breakfast?

19:22.188 --> 19:24.988
- It's one night.
- What will people think?

19:25.847 --> 19:27.312
I don't give a damn.

19:27.879 --> 19:29.625
That's abundantly clear.

19:50.554 --> 19:51.922
She hates us...

19:52.504 --> 19:55.084
- your housekeeper.
- She hates everyone.

19:55.175 --> 19:57.416
Once we're gone, she'll
wash the sheets twice.

19:57.452 --> 19:59.179
Not everyone is prejudiced.

19:59.215 --> 20:02.452
With all due respect, you don't
know a damn thing about it.

20:08.635 --> 20:09.766
So tell me.

20:23.651 --> 20:26.061
A white lady once wiped a
bench with her handkerchief

20:26.097 --> 20:27.410
because I'd been sitting there.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.095
I was four years
old at the time.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.131
Sorry.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.046
Were you close, you and Charles?

20:39.693 --> 20:42.410
- I admired him.
- It's not quite the same.

20:44.090 --> 20:46.275
It's hard to be close
in a family like ours.

20:47.894 --> 20:49.363
We don't have affection,

20:49.660 --> 20:50.988
we have a cause.

20:52.738 --> 20:54.935
Maybe you should
cancel the tour.

20:55.860 --> 20:57.160
We should.

20:57.410 --> 20:58.582
But we won't.

20:59.253 --> 21:00.508
We'll keep on going.

21:01.410 --> 21:02.681
But you're grieving.

21:03.151 --> 21:04.618
Grief is undignified.

21:05.549 --> 21:08.816
If there's one time you're
allowed to be undignified,

21:08.852 --> 21:10.236
I'd say that it's now.

21:15.199 --> 21:16.501
You drink too much.

21:20.450 --> 21:21.450
I know.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.586
Maybe you're the one
who needs a cause?

21:26.175 --> 21:27.197
Maybe.

21:27.652 --> 21:28.857
Are you happy?

21:30.614 --> 21:33.375
- Are you?
- Present circumstances aside, you mean?

21:33.410 --> 21:34.540
Sorry.

21:34.832 --> 21:36.448
You apologise too much, too.

21:40.175 --> 21:42.701
Why don't you speak
at the talks?

21:42.737 --> 21:44.444
I support my father.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.430
But you have so much to say.

21:48.105 --> 21:50.070
And you say it so beautifully.

21:50.486 --> 21:52.375
It's just the way things are.

21:52.410 --> 21:54.002
Why don't you change
the way things are?

21:54.644 --> 21:55.903
Why don't you?

22:01.941 --> 22:03.906
Thank you... for your...

22:04.324 --> 22:06.969
hospitality, Mr Chambers.

23:02.410 --> 23:03.713
I'm sorry.

23:06.483 --> 23:08.112
You apologise too much.

23:51.910 --> 23:53.010
Thank you, ma'am.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.322
Morning.

23:55.728 --> 23:56.835
Toast?

23:56.870 --> 24:00.095
Ooh, I think I'll push the boat out,
Mrs C, and have a soft-boiled egg.

24:00.595 --> 24:01.987
You're very chipper.

24:02.023 --> 24:05.112
- I had a wonderful night's sleep.
- At least someone did.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.833
So, how do we feel about a
spoken-word tent... at the fete?

24:16.955 --> 24:20.608
Aren't all words spoken? Isn't
that the very nature of words?

24:20.644 --> 24:22.449
It's poetry, Mrs C.

24:22.485 --> 24:24.704
- Sounds a bit modern.
- If you'll excuse us, ma'am,

24:24.740 --> 24:27.367
we have an engagement to honour.

24:27.781 --> 24:29.191
Are you sure that's wise?

24:29.806 --> 24:31.512
Let me speak to Geordie first.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.773
Always looking to save.

24:42.716 --> 24:45.650
This is what we found out
about your Phineas Society.

24:46.807 --> 24:49.131
All that, "We are
everywhere" cobblers.

24:49.283 --> 24:51.248
It's just you in your
underpants writing letters.

24:51.284 --> 24:53.659
- Treatises.
- Jesus Christ, boy. They're letters.

24:53.695 --> 24:55.820
I never threatened the girl.

24:55.856 --> 24:58.564
So you wrote all the letters bar
the one that threatens Miss Todd?

24:58.600 --> 24:59.689
- Yes.
- You barged into that talk

24:59.713 --> 25:00.921
shouting your mouth off!

25:00.957 --> 25:03.270
- I didn't barge in. I was invited.
- By who?

25:03.306 --> 25:04.625
Professor Barkley.

25:13.410 --> 25:15.410
Why make up a secret society?

25:15.986 --> 25:18.150
Girls like dangerous men.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.515
Son, I'll tell you
this for nothing,

25:20.550 --> 25:23.158
you will never in all your
born days be dangerous.

25:25.823 --> 25:28.405
My advice would be to cancel
any further engagements.

25:28.441 --> 25:31.161
- You're trying to silence them?
- I'm not trying to silence anybody.

25:31.721 --> 25:34.070
I'm almost certain Gregory
Jones isn't the killer.

25:34.106 --> 25:37.071
Almost certain?
That's heartening.

25:37.107 --> 25:39.500
And if he isn't, the
perpetrator's still at large.

25:39.536 --> 25:42.016
If you came here to reassure, you
aren't doing a very good job.

25:43.904 --> 25:46.662
Why did you invite Gregory
Jones to the talk, Professor?

25:46.698 --> 25:49.049
I'm an educator. I educate.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.944
Strikes me you were looking
to liven things up a bit.

25:52.057 --> 25:55.208
Our aim is to raise money and
spirited debate creates interest.

25:55.244 --> 25:56.469
Backfired a bit, didn't it?

25:57.189 --> 25:59.078
You're still in danger, Mr Todd.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.222
Your daughter's still in danger.

26:02.697 --> 26:05.752
We are always in danger, sir.

26:06.510 --> 26:09.289
So you'll understand why I'm asking
you not to continue the tour?

26:09.325 --> 26:11.221
This is censorship. This
man has a right to speak.

26:11.245 --> 26:13.217
It's not censorship, Henry.

26:13.592 --> 26:15.560
It is common sense.

26:30.071 --> 26:31.530
Set-to with God?

26:32.923 --> 26:34.563
God would be easier.

26:39.229 --> 26:41.194
Saw you preach here
a few years back.

26:41.338 --> 26:43.721
- You were fantastic.
- Are you sure it was me?

26:45.870 --> 26:48.681
You told a story about
your Sunday school class.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.873
A little boy who just learned that
Adam formed Eve from his rib.

26:52.064 --> 26:54.029
And that evening he
had a stomach ache

26:54.065 --> 26:56.465
- and he said to his mum...
- "I think I'm having a wife."

27:01.154 --> 27:03.944
Will, I don't think you came here
to talk about Sunday school.

27:06.634 --> 27:08.865
- Don't be so naive.
- I'm not being naive.

27:08.901 --> 27:11.183
- Mr Deveaux...
- You put profit above his safety...

27:11.597 --> 27:13.224
I don't think they've
noticed I've gone.

27:13.510 --> 27:15.515
- Probably not.
- Here's where I'm lost.

27:16.486 --> 27:18.042
If there is no Phineas Society,

27:18.078 --> 27:20.314
who carved a bloody great
cross on the wall, hm?

27:20.350 --> 27:21.996
Gregory Jones was in custody.

27:22.510 --> 27:25.354
The only other people who knew about
those letters were in that house.

27:25.550 --> 27:27.995
The Barkleys. And the Yanks.

27:28.285 --> 27:29.437
Here we go.

27:29.630 --> 27:31.474
- What?
- Violet knew you would do this.

27:31.510 --> 27:33.241
She knew you'd make
them the suspects.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.178
Please tell me you didn't.

27:37.214 --> 27:40.179
Dress it up any way you like,
Geordie, it's prejudice.

27:40.755 --> 27:41.915
You did, didn't you?

27:42.068 --> 27:43.256
You screwed her.

27:46.252 --> 27:48.217
She's grieving, for
Christ's sake.

27:48.950 --> 27:49.900
I know that.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.901
- She's a suspect.
- She's not a suspect.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.554
Of course she is! They all are.

27:58.870 --> 28:01.274
The knife found on Violet's
bed wasn't the murder weapon.

28:01.310 --> 28:03.275
That's a nice change of subject.
Seamless.

28:03.311 --> 28:04.577
You are a bloody idiot.

28:04.613 --> 28:06.728
You're looking for a kitchen
knife about this big.

28:07.251 --> 28:08.867
What are you not
telling me, Sidney?

28:24.275 --> 28:25.536
I was given it.

28:26.510 --> 28:27.475
By whom?

28:27.510 --> 28:30.019
By someone who wishes
to remain anonymous.

28:31.723 --> 28:34.475
You see, I understand how it
works, the whole vicar...

28:34.510 --> 28:37.060
- Chaplain.
- Dog-collar hoopla.

28:38.647 --> 28:40.772
People feel they can
tell you things.

28:40.881 --> 28:42.246
- Of course.
- Secrets.

28:42.282 --> 28:43.751
- Absolutely.
- Confessions.

28:43.963 --> 28:46.469
The most intimate things
you wouldn't believe.

28:46.969 --> 28:48.358
That is where you and I differ.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.675
- No-one tells you anything?
- Not a bastard thing.

28:50.710 --> 28:52.413
- That's a shame.
- It really is.

28:54.369 --> 28:56.127
Who gave you the
knife, Chaplain?

28:56.538 --> 28:57.902
I'm not going to tell you that.

29:00.158 --> 29:03.158
- Is it someone you know?
- I'm not going to tell you that, either.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.357
Did they confess to the
murder of Charles Todd?

29:07.393 --> 29:08.944
I should probably
stop you there.

29:09.596 --> 29:11.336
I'm not going to
tell you anything

29:11.510 --> 29:13.745
at any point about any of it...

29:14.041 --> 29:15.041
sir.

29:16.626 --> 29:20.475
I was told in confidence. It's
not my information to tell.

29:21.205 --> 29:24.292
You understand there's no higher
authority than the police force?

29:24.328 --> 29:26.100
I'd say God's a
little bit higher.

29:26.345 --> 29:28.829
- You think this is a joke?
- Of course I don't.

29:28.865 --> 29:30.152
A man is dead.

29:30.666 --> 29:32.401
And where were the
bloody police?

29:32.919 --> 29:35.510
Doing nothing while those bigots
had the run of the place.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.371
Who gave you the
knife, Chaplain?

29:40.275 --> 29:43.037
- No-one is above the law.
- I don't claim to be.

29:44.877 --> 29:47.606
If I break their trust, what
kind of man does that make me?

29:48.549 --> 29:50.122
Let alone a priest.

30:12.750 --> 30:14.475
He's a stubborn old sod.

30:15.577 --> 30:16.584
So am I.

30:16.861 --> 30:18.114
Unfortunately.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.595
Why does he think you're
a liability, the Dean?

30:31.635 --> 30:33.895
- He says I'm a boat-rocker.
- Are you?

30:33.931 --> 30:35.436
Oh, absolutely.

30:35.666 --> 30:37.992
We have a platform
to say something.

30:38.565 --> 30:39.781
We have a boat.

30:39.837 --> 30:41.249
Why not rock it?

30:42.720 --> 30:45.116
He once called me a "dissenter".

30:45.944 --> 30:47.867
- Are you?
- Absolutely.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.965
There was a time I would
never break a confidence.

30:55.510 --> 30:57.542
Meeting a man of the law
changed that, did it?

30:58.728 --> 31:02.659
Let's just say, Geordie
gave me a new perspective.

31:04.572 --> 31:06.675
The person who came
to me was afraid.

31:07.455 --> 31:08.740
I gave them my word.

31:09.105 --> 31:12.611
There are no laws in our church
about sharing a confession.

31:12.647 --> 31:14.714
It's a moral obligation,
though, surely?

31:14.750 --> 31:17.715
Isn't there a moral obligation
to bring a killer to justice?

31:18.212 --> 31:19.220
It just...

31:19.610 --> 31:21.072
It just feels wrong.

31:22.010 --> 31:24.237
God believes in the
goodness of men,

31:24.510 --> 31:27.932
and although he can
be an arse sometimes,

31:28.213 --> 31:30.213
Geordie is the best of men.

31:31.783 --> 31:33.199
You can trust him.

31:33.752 --> 31:35.228
I promise you that.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.844
He insists the knife was placed into
his pocket by an unknown assailant.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.880
Who?

31:48.165 --> 31:50.213
He fears you'll blame
him for the murder.

31:51.869 --> 31:53.353
I fear you will, too.

31:54.275 --> 31:55.493
Who?

32:00.751 --> 32:02.068
Robert Deveaux.

32:12.810 --> 32:15.285
I know that must have
cost you personally,

32:15.658 --> 32:18.017
and I am grateful, Mr Davenport.

32:24.767 --> 32:25.967
Please...

32:26.986 --> 32:28.804
- call me Will.
- Geordie.

32:29.251 --> 32:30.545
Good to meet you, Will.

32:38.062 --> 32:40.001
And, lo, it came to pass.

32:49.697 --> 32:50.921
Get off me.

32:52.962 --> 32:54.962
- Come on.
- Get off me!

32:56.134 --> 32:57.850
Get off me.

32:58.182 --> 33:00.147
- Hands off. Get off me!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

33:00.183 --> 33:01.273
Get off.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.510
- Calm down.
- Get off me.

33:13.110 --> 33:16.075
You want to hear that I killed
Charles over some slight or other?

33:16.438 --> 33:18.438
A burning anger
born in jealousy?

33:19.438 --> 33:22.075
- He was a brother to me.
- Violet was threatened, too.

33:22.110 --> 33:24.075
Do you consider her your sister?

33:24.466 --> 33:26.277
Your motives are
unmistakable, Reverend.

33:26.313 --> 33:28.278
- This letter...
- What motives are they?

33:29.038 --> 33:31.075
She could never
love a white man.

33:31.110 --> 33:34.075
The one that threatens Miss
Todd, did you write it?

33:34.110 --> 33:35.914
They were sent by that boy.

33:36.110 --> 33:37.409
All but this one.

33:38.387 --> 33:41.368
Read this passage for me,
if you would, Mr Deveaux.

33:45.789 --> 33:47.754
"Your visit here is an affront.

33:47.883 --> 33:50.635
"Whites and coloureds
should not mingle."

33:52.023 --> 33:53.674
"Coloureds" is spelt
without a "U".

33:54.994 --> 33:56.344
The American spelling.

33:57.196 --> 33:58.650
You wrote it.

34:00.398 --> 34:02.115
You put that knife on her bed.

34:02.789 --> 34:04.694
You wanted to scare her.

34:06.580 --> 34:09.915
We had no business here.
We should go home.

34:09.949 --> 34:13.074
- Violet needs to be home.
- With you, you mean?

34:13.596 --> 34:15.478
Why'd you come to
our talk, Reverend?

34:16.110 --> 34:17.772
To dabble with controversy?

34:18.614 --> 34:20.600
To feel a frisson of danger?

34:20.780 --> 34:23.425
Then go home to your quiet life?

34:23.969 --> 34:27.069
Smug that you did your
bit for the Negro?

34:27.521 --> 34:29.789
When y'all done nothing at
all but perpetuate the myth

34:29.824 --> 34:31.315
that we only save
'em from ourselves.

34:31.351 --> 34:33.139
Did you kill Charles Todd?

34:35.909 --> 34:37.110
I did not, sir.

34:39.110 --> 34:41.110
Did you intend to
kill Violet Todd?

34:44.040 --> 34:47.005
Why would I kill the woman
I one day hope to marry?

34:52.322 --> 34:54.022
Is it ostentatious?

34:54.058 --> 34:55.493
- No.
- Yes.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.075
Telephone.

34:58.110 --> 35:00.075
Marvellously so. I love it.

35:00.110 --> 35:02.435
There, you see, Leonard
thinks it's marvellous.

35:02.813 --> 35:04.457
What does he know?

35:04.832 --> 35:06.826
You can take it right back.

35:08.282 --> 35:10.247
- Vicarage.
- <i>Say it is Gregory.</i>

35:10.283 --> 35:12.784
- It's not Gregory.
- <i>He's angry at the world.</i>

35:12.820 --> 35:14.284
<i>He hates coloured people.</i>

35:14.320 --> 35:16.075
Mrs Bennett accusing
me of being flashy?

35:16.110 --> 35:18.618
I like you flashy. The
flashier the better.

35:18.654 --> 35:22.075
Stabbing someone, twisting
the knife, it's vicious.

35:22.110 --> 35:23.729
- <i>And Gregory's not vicious?</i>

35:23.765 --> 35:26.468
- He made up a secret
society to impress girls.

35:26.622 --> 35:29.657
<i>Fair point. Which brings
us back to square one.</i>

35:29.693 --> 35:31.748
<i>Any bugger could have done it.
Damn.</i>

35:31.784 --> 35:33.075
I'm gonna call you back.

35:33.110 --> 35:35.075
<i>Thank you for your sterling
contribution there.</i>

35:35.110 --> 35:37.874
- You are 26.
- So I should think myself grateful?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.595
Robert cares for you.

35:40.630 --> 35:43.422
Did you even think to
ask what I thought?

35:43.458 --> 35:46.075
I have opinions. I have
thoughts and feelings.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.110
Feelings?!

35:55.251 --> 35:58.075
I'm part of this struggle,
at the forefront of change,

35:58.110 --> 36:02.075
and yet they see me as good for
nothing but marriage and babies.

36:02.187 --> 36:04.465
Look pretty, keep quiet.

36:05.211 --> 36:07.621
Like all those butterflies
in their cases.

36:08.304 --> 36:10.075
They'd be hard pushed
to keep you quiet.

36:10.683 --> 36:12.372
Are you saying I talk too much?

36:12.408 --> 36:13.741
That's exactly what I'm saying.

36:14.110 --> 36:16.630
- I'm gonna take that as a compliment.
- I meant it as one.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.478
Violet.

36:22.649 --> 36:24.215
I have done this before.

36:24.737 --> 36:26.020
A few times.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.075
More than a few times

36:28.110 --> 36:31.075
- with more than a few women.
- It's none of my business.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.782
No, it is. I want to
be honest with you.

36:33.818 --> 36:35.115
I just...

36:35.409 --> 36:37.847
don't want you to think
that I took advantage.

36:38.789 --> 36:40.754
Well, maybe I took
advantage of you.

36:41.281 --> 36:42.641
Have you thought about that?

36:44.491 --> 36:45.889
I haven't thought about that.

36:46.470 --> 36:47.970
And, frankly, I'm appalled.

36:49.041 --> 36:51.075
You have to understand
where I come from,

36:51.110 --> 36:55.110
this, us, can never be.

36:56.110 --> 36:57.808
I was a novelty, was I?

36:58.110 --> 37:01.075
They killed that boy in my town
for buying a white girl a soda.

37:01.816 --> 37:03.627
People have died
for less than sex.

37:03.663 --> 37:05.075
People have died for...

37:05.110 --> 37:07.230
For having the audacity to
assume that they're equals.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.110
Exactly.

37:12.110 --> 37:13.442
The party.

37:15.110 --> 37:17.110
The night before
your brother died.

37:19.442 --> 37:21.110
Who did he dance with?

37:23.110 --> 37:24.316
Madhia Barkley.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.110
Why?

37:31.110 --> 37:32.527
Come on, Esme.

37:32.695 --> 37:35.055
I'd rather not, if
it's all the same.

37:36.110 --> 37:37.312
Tuppence, was it?

37:37.348 --> 37:39.444
It's all right. I've got it.

37:40.399 --> 37:41.399
Thank you.

37:42.110 --> 37:43.471
Well, that was humiliating.

37:44.047 --> 37:46.002
It's tuppence, Geordie.

37:46.038 --> 37:47.847
It's not like I pulled
your trousers down

37:47.883 --> 37:49.606
and gave everyone a look
at your family jewels.

37:49.630 --> 37:51.755
Cathy! Language.

37:51.790 --> 37:53.459
Don't be such a prude.

38:00.790 --> 38:02.075
Miss Todd.

38:02.276 --> 38:04.075
Sidney sniff out the
beer tent, did he?

38:04.110 --> 38:05.704
No, he left.

38:08.262 --> 38:10.950
The tour's been cancelled.
It's a travesty.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.667
Freedom to speak isn't a right,
it's a bloody necessity.

38:15.456 --> 38:18.075
How long have you been
married, Professor Barkley?

38:18.110 --> 38:21.075
- Six years. Why?
- Do you trust your wife?

38:21.110 --> 38:23.583
Oh, what an odd question. Yes,
of course I do. Implicitly.

38:23.619 --> 38:26.222
Charles danced with her.

38:26.258 --> 38:27.832
Is that all it took?

38:29.655 --> 38:31.495
I thought we were discussing
freedom of speech.

38:31.531 --> 38:34.086
- It's not about trust, though, is it?
- I'd like you to leave now.

38:34.110 --> 38:37.075
She's your queen. It's
all about possessing.

38:37.110 --> 38:39.075
You are dangerously
close to insulting me.

38:39.110 --> 38:42.435
Did it matter that he was coloured
or is it any man touching your wife?

38:42.470 --> 38:44.595
- I'm calling the police.
- For all your liberality,

38:44.630 --> 38:46.755
for all your open-mindedness,

38:46.790 --> 38:48.310
you couldn't bear to
see it, could you?

38:49.030 --> 38:50.435
I imagine in that brief moment

38:50.470 --> 38:53.075
she enjoyed herself more
than she ever did with you.

38:53.495 --> 38:55.075
Her arms around him,

38:55.690 --> 38:58.075
his hand in the
small of her back.

38:58.282 --> 39:00.247
<i>You couldn't bear it, could you?</i>

39:00.565 --> 39:02.799
Madhia smiling up at him.

39:02.835 --> 39:04.875
Argh.

39:17.110 --> 39:18.790
Argh.

39:23.852 --> 39:25.610
She's my wife.

39:26.110 --> 39:28.075
She's my wife!

39:28.110 --> 39:29.139
Argh!

39:31.110 --> 39:32.310
Get him off.

39:34.317 --> 39:36.075
Sidney?

39:40.367 --> 39:42.367
You've got to stop doing this.

39:44.354 --> 39:46.075
Ah, stop fussing.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.651
Your lip's bleeding,
you daft sod.

39:55.418 --> 39:57.555
Trying to get yourself
killed, is that it?

40:00.849 --> 40:02.293
That's what it feels like.

40:03.793 --> 40:06.672
You speaking didn't
cause your son's death.

40:07.363 --> 40:09.525
It was the jealousy
of a possessive man.

40:11.110 --> 40:14.075
Charles died because
he was a black man

40:14.164 --> 40:16.769
that touched a white man's wife.

40:20.790 --> 40:22.522
This is what we're up against.

40:24.110 --> 40:25.457
It's not your fault, Papa.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.075
Please don't think that.

40:28.110 --> 40:29.652
Did Charles know...

40:30.798 --> 40:31.798
Er...

40:32.500 --> 40:33.866
that I loved him?

40:34.766 --> 40:36.163
Of course he did.

40:37.907 --> 40:40.427
I never... told him.

40:41.992 --> 40:43.672
I never said the words.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.264
He knew.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.763
Of course he knew.

40:59.938 --> 41:01.311
When do you leave?

41:02.187 --> 41:05.512
As soon as we can. Tomorrow.
Hopefully.

41:07.459 --> 41:09.790
I've never seen Papa
like this before.

41:11.342 --> 41:13.075
He'll find the way through it.

41:13.576 --> 41:15.110
He'll find the strength.

41:23.790 --> 41:25.716
I have to go and
give the blessing.

41:27.557 --> 41:28.809
That's fine.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.191
You go.

41:33.348 --> 41:34.599
Come with me.

41:41.470 --> 41:43.260
Have you seen that dreadful hat?

41:43.296 --> 41:45.581
They're laughing at me.
They think I'm showing off.

41:45.833 --> 41:47.534
Sod the lot of 'em. Come on.

41:47.852 --> 41:48.817
Jack!

41:48.853 --> 41:51.136
I'm not saying she married
him for the money, but...

41:51.172 --> 41:53.717
Oh, it wasn't the money
she married me for.

41:54.450 --> 41:56.745
- It was the lovemaking.
- Jack!

41:59.110 --> 42:02.768
And now please welcome one
of our fine local poets.

42:11.110 --> 42:13.075
Spring...

42:13.110 --> 42:15.115
Spring by LE Finch.

42:15.150 --> 42:17.275
- What does the E stand for?
- Ernest.

42:17.310 --> 42:19.435
- "From darkness..."
- Course it does.

42:19.665 --> 42:21.066
"unfurling.

42:21.727 --> 42:23.755
"From moist climes

42:24.085 --> 42:25.915
"springs life.

42:26.641 --> 42:28.110
"Surging forth.

42:29.110 --> 42:30.357
"Pushing.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.110
"Eager.

42:34.124 --> 42:35.567
"Tentative.

42:35.882 --> 42:37.252
"Tumultuous."

42:37.288 --> 42:40.075
- Someone swallowed a thesaurus.
- "Bursting.

42:40.110 --> 42:41.462
"Quivering.

42:41.875 --> 42:44.927
"A new life. A new peace.

42:46.578 --> 42:47.829
"Sated.

42:49.110 --> 42:50.595
"Finally.

42:51.751 --> 42:52.751
"Done."

42:54.110 --> 42:55.801
Someone's had sex.

42:55.837 --> 42:57.837
He's struggling a little
with the subtext.

43:03.110 --> 43:05.075
Is that what he's been
working on all this time?

43:05.110 --> 43:07.075
It doesn't even rhyme.

43:07.110 --> 43:09.272
Poems don't have to
rhyme any more, Mrs C.

43:09.308 --> 43:12.809
And now Mr Chambers
will say the blessing.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.075
You do it.

43:15.110 --> 43:16.110
You speak.

43:16.571 --> 43:17.736
Give them hell.

43:18.127 --> 43:20.339
No-one wants to hear
what I have to say.

43:20.375 --> 43:23.375
No, but they're all too
polite to stop you, so...

43:26.110 --> 43:27.310
All right.

43:31.110 --> 43:32.533
What's she doing?

43:38.391 --> 43:40.110
My name is Violet Todd.

43:41.110 --> 43:43.075
And it may come as
a surprise to you,

43:43.110 --> 43:45.763
but I'm not from
around these parts.

43:49.110 --> 43:50.806
I am from a place

43:51.110 --> 43:53.581
of violence, oppression,

43:53.964 --> 43:55.395
and prejudice.

43:56.128 --> 43:58.480
You may look around you and
think, "Who gives a damn?

43:58.917 --> 44:00.418
"There's none of that here."

44:00.909 --> 44:02.110
But look harder.

44:03.630 --> 44:04.973
There is oppression.

44:05.790 --> 44:07.146
There is prejudice.

44:08.176 --> 44:09.552
There is suffering.

44:10.852 --> 44:13.375
And if one person
suffers, we all do.

44:14.645 --> 44:17.110
If one person
falls, we all fall.

44:20.547 --> 44:22.099
I truly believe

44:22.587 --> 44:25.337
there is a better
time for all of us.

44:28.343 --> 44:31.110
<i>One where we all have
our moment in the sun.</i>

44:33.258 --> 44:36.938
<i>But to get there, we
must stand together.</i>

44:38.298 --> 44:39.713
Side by side,

44:40.455 --> 44:42.338
we must walk together

44:42.867 --> 44:45.272
and leave no-one behind.

44:46.305 --> 44:52.627
