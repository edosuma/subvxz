00:22.956 --> 00:25.824
I don't know if we're going
to make it, Professor.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.859
Uh, I know I'm late.
Totally, know I'm late.

00:27.894 --> 00:30.796
But I got a great excuse.
My head, may or not
have started a forest fire.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.231
Yes.
Can you believe that?

00:33.266 --> 00:34.466
Anybody?

00:35.902 --> 00:36.935
Anybody?

00:37.437 --> 00:38.837
Ronald?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.673
No one is here.

00:43.009 --> 00:45.644
Wow! I can't believe they
forgot about our meeting.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.212
I mean, who would
ever do that?

00:47.247 --> 00:50.449
Something's obviously wrong.
Someone is always here.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.984
Try their comm-links.

00:53.453 --> 00:56.988
-(BEEPS)
-Mmm, they're all offline.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.724
I mean, that's odd, right?
If we're talking about odd.

00:59.759 --> 01:03.295
We need to find one of them.
Any of them. Fast.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.763
But, where would we start?

01:04.798 --> 01:07.199
How about the <i> Daily Planet?</i>

01:07.234 --> 01:08.467
Why would we go there?

01:08.502 --> 01:10.469
Oh, Ronald.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.370
Clark Kent is Superman?

01:12.405 --> 01:16.008
What? My brain is on fire.
Literally on fire.

Hello?

01:32.425 --> 01:35.026
Hey, Clark.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.296
Wow. Hi.
How can I help you?

01:38.798 --> 01:40.599
Yeah, I just wanted
to make sure you were okay.

01:40.634 --> 01:41.967
I came in
for a League meeting.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.169
Early, I might add.
And no one was there.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.004
You know,
I think it's kind of rude

01:46.039 --> 01:48.773
not to be at a meeting
when someone is there,

01:48.808 --> 01:50.309
with their...
With their head lit.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.778
I'm sorry, "League"?

01:53.813 --> 01:55.380
Yeah, the Justice League.

01:55.415 --> 01:59.017
Big group of superheroes.
Me, Wonder Woman, Batman, you.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.221
(SNICKERS) Me?
And who am I supposed to be?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.789
Superman. Dude?

02:04.824 --> 02:06.791
(WHISPERS)
What's wrong with you?

02:06.826 --> 02:08.293
Superman? (CHUCKLES)

02:08.328 --> 02:10.328
I think maybe those
flames on your head

02:10.363 --> 02:12.764
are burning a little too hot.
(CHUCKLES)

02:12.799 --> 02:16.235
I'm not Superman. I'm just
mild-mannered reporter,
Clark Kent.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.272
Now I know something is wrong.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.406
-You think?
-Pardon?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.275
Oh, nothing. You know.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.609
I'm just talking
to a disembodied professor
that lives in my head.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.677
Now listen to me. Focus.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.679
You are Superman.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.315
I wish. If I looked remotely
like Superman,

02:30.350 --> 02:32.517
Lois, might give me the
time of day.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.153
Hi, Lois.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.555
See?

02:36.590 --> 02:41.093
Now, listen.
You're the one and true,
red and blue, Superman!

02:42.862 --> 02:44.796
And I can prove it to you.

02:49.202 --> 02:50.202
(SCREAMS)

02:51.638 --> 02:53.305
What? Are you crazy?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.607
That was a nice shirt.

02:55.642 --> 02:59.277
Well, you should have
had your costume
underneath your clothes.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.680
How would I even
use the bathroom?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.315
Seeing is believing, Ronald.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.784
-Show him.
-Uh, that is a great idea.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.686
Oh, that's cute.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.388
What's this supposed to prove?

03:10.423 --> 03:12.724
I know what I look like. I...

03:12.759 --> 03:15.594
I don't know,
I don't see it, but...

03:15.629 --> 03:17.128
(GASPS)

03:17.163 --> 03:19.064
Clark. Superman.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.232
Clark.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.733
Superman.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.135
Just because I bare
a passing resemblance
to Superman,

03:24.170 --> 03:26.371
doesn't mean I am
the actual Man of Steel.

03:26.406 --> 03:29.140
I mean...
He's super strong and flies.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.643
That's right.
He flies. Perfect!

03:31.678 --> 03:32.878
Whoa.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.780
-Now I'm gonna drop you.
-(GASPS)

03:39.653 --> 03:41.620
Go on. Flap your arms.
Come on, fly.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.355
You sure about this, Ronald?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.423
100%.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.425
(THUDDING)

03:47.460 --> 03:49.094
Okay, yeah, maybe 50%.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.932
Huh?

03:55.101 --> 03:56.968
I'm alive!

03:57.003 --> 03:59.537
-I'm alive?
-(CHUCKLES) See?

03:59.572 --> 04:02.207
Only Superman
could've survived
a fall like that.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.710
And thank goodness,
'cause that would've been
really awkward.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.012
Superman.

04:07.047 --> 04:10.215
If you're right then why don't
I remember anything?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.117
Hmm, yeah.

04:12.152 --> 04:13.785
You know, I was thinking
about that.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.722
The most likely scenario is...

04:17.357 --> 04:18.423
I got nothing.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.091
Maybe if we found
some other Leaguers,

04:20.126 --> 04:21.893
we could start
to figure this out.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.895
Great idea, Prof.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.900
Bruce Wayne, billionaire.
You are?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.802
Not interested.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.805
Unless, of course,
they don't have any idea.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.073
Why are we here?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.542
Because you are
the Justice League.

He's Superman.
You're Batman.

that is some legit
proof right there.

Maybe if you...

05:18.518 --> 05:20.185
You know.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.187
Right! Oh, Prof,
you are on point today
with your ideas.
